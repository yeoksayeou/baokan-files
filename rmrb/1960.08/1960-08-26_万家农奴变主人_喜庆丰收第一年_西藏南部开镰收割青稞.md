Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa Telegram: The first good news of bumper harvests has arrived from southern Tibet. In Yadong, Bomi, Linzhi, and other areas with earlier seasons, highland barley and wheat harvests began in late July, with yields significantly higher than in previous years.

When farmers in many places went to the fields, they carried portraits of Chairman Mao, sang the song "Socialism is Good," and planted five-star red flags at the edges of the fields before waving their sickles and starting the autumn harvest. Leading cadres at all levels also went to the front lines of the autumn harvest. Farmers in Zhangda Township, Milin County, Linzhi Prefecture, saw a significant increase in the average yield of highland barley per "ke" of land (equivalent to one mu) this year compared to previous years. The yield of highland barley harvested by the Jiuzigang mutual aid team in Lazhong Township, Yigong Lake, Bomi County, greatly exceeded the original production increase target. One hundred and fifty "ke" of winter highland barley in Lower Yadong District, Yadong County, achieved a large-scale bumper harvest this year.

During this year's autumn harvest, mutual aid teams in various places fully played their role, uniformly allocating labor and dividing into specialized groups for harvesting, transportation, and threshing. They concentrated their efforts, harvesting one plot, transporting one plot, and threshing one plot, making the autumn harvest work faster and better than in previous years. In Baima District, Basu County in the east, farmers used to harvest only seven or eight "ke" of land a day with a dozen people, but this year a mutual aid team of a dozen people can harvest more than twenty-five "ke" a day, greatly improving work efficiency compared to previous years. In the past, some areas in southern Tibet lacked autumn harvest tools during the harvest season, using bamboo sticks to pick wheat ears and oxen to thresh. This year, sickles are used for harvesting in various places, and new stone rollers and windmills are used for threshing, greatly speeding up the autumn harvest. (Attached picture)

    万家农奴变主人  喜庆丰收第一年
    西藏南部开镰收割青稞
    据新华社拉萨电　西藏南部地区首传丰收捷报，季节较早的亚东、波密、林芝等地区的青稞、小麦已在7月下旬开镰收割，各地产量比往年大大提高。
    许多地方的农民到田间去的时候，抬着毛主席像，唱着“社会主义好”的歌曲，并在田间地头插上五星红旗，然后挥舞着镰刀，进行秋收。各地领导干部也深入秋收第一线。林芝专区米林县章达乡农民，今年平均每克地（相当一亩）收割青稞的产量，比往年有大幅度地增长。波密县易贡湖畔拉中乡久子岗互助组已收青稞地的产量，大大超过了原订增产指标。亚东县下亚东区的一百五十克冬青稞今年获得了大面积丰收。
    在今年的秋收中，各地的互助组充分发挥了作用，统一调配劳动力，分收割、运输、打场等专业组，集中力量，收一块、运一块、打一块，使秋收工作比往年进行得又快又好。东部巴宿县的白马区的广大农民，往年十几个人一天只收七、八克地，今年一个互助组十几个人一天能收二十五克多，工效比往年大大提高。过去西藏南部有些地区收割时缺少秋收工具，收割时用竹棍夹取麦穗，打场用牛踩，今年各地收割时都使用镰刀，打场用新的石磙和风车，秋收进度很快。（附图片）
