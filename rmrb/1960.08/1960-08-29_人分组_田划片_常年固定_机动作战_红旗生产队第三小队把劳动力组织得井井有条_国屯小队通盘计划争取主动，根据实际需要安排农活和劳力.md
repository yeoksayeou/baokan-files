    The Third Team of the Red Flag Production Brigade Organizes Its Labor Force Efficiently
    Guotun Team Makes Overall Plans to Take the Initiative, Arranging Farm Work and Labor According to Actual Needs
    This newspaper reports: How to bring the labor force into play in an orderly manner after it is concentrated on the front line of production? The Third Team of the Red Flag Production Brigade in Maoshi Commune, Jianli County, Hubei Province, has initially solved this problem by adopting the method of "people grouped, fields allotted, year-round fixed, and mobile operations."
    The Third Team of the Red Flag Production Brigade has 43 households, 221 people, and 76 male and female laborers. The team has a total of 581 mu of paddy and dry land, with an average of 8 mu of cultivated land per laborer. Because the labor force is organized in an orderly manner and the quota work points are reasonably calculated, the labor attendance rate has remained above 90% since August, and the average labor efficiency has reached 1.1 work points. In the busy situation of the previous twelve kinds of intertwined tasks, they can still complete the tasks on time and in the required quantity.
    In accordance with the spirit of concentrating the main force on the main attack, this team divided the labor force into three groups. One group is engaged in logistics (including cooking, raising pigs, and growing vegetables), with a fixed number of 11 laborers, accounting for 14% of the total labor force; one group is responsible for feeding cattle, with a fixed number of 4 laborers; and one group is engaged in field operations, with a fixed number of 59 laborers (accounting for 77.6% of the total labor force). In addition, two laborers are sent to participate in the sideline production team organized by the production brigade. In order to meet the needs of the work and facilitate the establishment of a production responsibility system, the 59 laborers responsible for field operations are divided into three work groups, with the team committee members serving as group leaders. In terms of the field management responsibility system, in addition to the collective responsibility of the members of each work group, two field managers with a strong sense of responsibility and rich production experience are also assigned to be responsible for checking production quality and reporting crop growth to the team leader and relevant work group leaders in a timely manner.
    After the establishment of the work groups, in order to properly solve the contradiction between key tasks and general tasks, urgent tasks and slow tasks, and not disrupt the order of labor organization, they adopted the following methods: Under normal circumstances, they insist on production by work group, subcontracting by section, and settlement by section. In the event of natural disasters and temporary large-scale tasks, the team will uniformly draw labor from each work group to form a temporary shock force. After the task is completed, the labor force will return to its original work group for production. During the period of reduced labor, each work group will re-arrange the contracted tasks, clarify the main attack direction, and give priority to ensuring key tasks and seasonal tasks. For example, during the previous period of drought and insect pests, and the need to rush to plant double-cropping late rice and manage the cultivation of existing crops, the team committee members comprehensively arranged the tasks, drawing 17 laborers to form a temporary work group to complete five urgent tasks such as drought resistance, pest control, and grain delivery. The original fixed work group concentrated its efforts on seven tasks such as rushing to plant double-cropping late rice and field cultivation management. In the past ten days, 123 mu of drought-stricken paddy and dry land have been irrigated once or twice, and the task of putting 23,000 jin of early rice surplus into storage has been completed; 62 mu of single-season late japonica rice have been top-dressed with ten dan of fertilizer, and 72 mu of third-class seedlings have been weeded in addition to top-dressing; and the task of rushing to plant 150 mu of double-cropping late rice has been completed. While arranging the main force to ensure the completion of the main tasks, a certain number of laborers are arranged to take on general tasks.
    In terms of work evaluation and point recording, this team adopts a combination of collective work recording and individual piecework. That is, the team calculates the work points based on the amount of work in this section and the number of mu, and contracts them to each work group. The work group adopts two methods of work recording according to the different characteristics of various tasks. One is suitable for collective production tasks such as harvesting rice, transplanting rice seedlings, etc., and collective contracting is adopted, and then the members participating in this task mutually evaluate the work points that each person should get per day within the total work points. The other is suitable for individual operations such as cutting field edges, pushing carts, raising cattle, etc., and work points are directly recorded to individuals according to the quota. Because the scoring and work recording are reasonable, the enthusiasm of the members for production is high. The six incidental laborers who did not work in the whole team also actively participated in labor.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Electric Report: The Guotun Team of the Shidun Production Brigade in Chengguan Commune, Feicheng County, Shandong, makes one-time arrangements for various farm work and labor use until the Frost's Descent, completing them in four stages, with each stage having its own focus, moving forward step by step, achieving good management of late autumn, good harvest of early autumn, and good preparation for autumn planting.
    Recently, the Party branch of the Guotun Team convened a meeting of all team cadres to analyze in detail the autumn busy season situation. There are only two months from now to the completion of the autumn harvest and autumn planting. Harvesting, planting, and managing various farm work are all crowded together, and the labor force is particularly tight. At present, late sweet potatoes, corn, cotton, and autumn vegetables all urgently need top-dressing, watering, and pest control. Some early autumn crops have begun to be harvested. After the harvest, the land must be immediately cultivated, and preparations for autumn planting must be made in advance. The team cadres believe that to complete these tasks, it is necessary to make an overall consideration of farm work and labor according to the season, formulate a comprehensive plan, and master it in stages, changing the past practice of arranging step by step. Through arranging tasks, calculating time, and checking labor, this team divides the two months of farm work before the Frost's Descent into four stages: Before the White Dew, the focus is on tackling late autumn crop management and harvesting early autumn crops in a timely manner; from the White Dew to the Autumn Equinox, the focus is on autumn harvest and autumn plowing, and continue to strengthen the management of sweet potatoes and vegetables; from the Autumn Equinox to the Cold Dew, the focus is on rushing to plow and rush to plant; from the Cold Dew to the Frost's Descent, it is to harvest sweet potatoes and rush to plant late wheat.
    Each stage is specifically arranged according to the importance and urgency of farm work and the attendance of labor, and all are implemented. In the execution, labor and plans are adjusted according to changes in climate and farm work, so that every farm work is managed by someone. For example, the first small stage plan has already begun to be implemented, and the seasonality of managing late autumn, harvesting early autumn, collecting feed, and other more than ten kinds of farm work is very strong. However, there are only 66 full and half laborers, plus the incidental laborers who can attend work. Transporting fertilizer for top-dressing occupies 16 people, watering occupies 22 people, managing cotton occupies 18 people, harvesting early autumn and field management occupies 5 people, and there are still several people in the vegetable garden. Therefore, farm work such as collecting feed and rushing to plant late vegetables that have been scheduled cannot be assigned. At this time, the team cadres analyzed the situation one by one, and found that the professional team managing cotton fields could free up time to manage autumn vegetables; a water pump was borrowed to irrigate 150 mu of land, and a part of the labor force was freed up to rush to plant late vegetables. The collection of 20,000 jin of feed was contracted to 110 primary school students. With such a deployment, large and small farm work is carried out in a main-to-secondary, interspersed manner, which not only guarantees the completion of the plan, but also allows the fertilizer transport shock team to advance 500 carts of fertilizer for autumn planting after completing the fertilizer transport plan for the seedling fields, bringing the farm work in the second stage forward.
    This team fully estimated the temporary difficulties that may be encountered in the formulation of the plan, and grasped the spirit of leaving room for maneuver to ensure the realization of the plan. For example, in the arrangement of labor, even the menstrual period, pregnancy period, and lactation period of female members were considered. After such arrangements, the members generally feel that it is practical and feasible, and they are full of confidence and greater enthusiasm. The initiative and foresight of the team cadres have also been greatly strengthened. (Attached photo)

    人分组　田划片　常年固定　机动作战
    红旗生产队第三小队把劳动力组织得井井有条
    国屯小队通盘计划争取主动，根据实际需要安排农活和劳力
    本报讯　劳动力集中到生产第一线以后，如何有条不紊地发挥作用？湖北省监利县毛市公社红旗生产队第三小队采取“人分组，田划片，常年固定，机动作战”的方法，初步解决了这个问题。
    红旗生产队第三小队有四十三户，二百二十一人，男女劳力七十六个，全队共有水旱田五百八十一亩，平均每个劳力负担八亩耕地。由于把劳动力组织得井井有条，定额计工合理，8月份以来劳动出勤率一直保持在90％以上，劳力平均工效达到一点一个工。在前段十二种活路犬牙交错的繁忙情况下，仍能做到如期如数地完成任务。
    按照把主要力量集中到主攻方面的精神，这个小队把劳力分成三套班子。一套搞后勤工作（包括炊事、养猪、种菜），固定十一个劳力，占总劳力的14％；一套负责喂牛，固定四个劳力；一套搞田间作业，固定五十九个劳力（占总劳力的77.6％），另派两个劳力参加生产队统一组织的副业队。为了适应活路的需要和便于建立生产责任制，又将负责田间作业的五十九个劳力编成三个作业组，由小队队委分别担任组长。在田间管理责任制方面，除每个作业组的社员集体负责以外，还确定两个责任心强，生产经验丰富的田间管理员，负责检查生产质量，及时向小队长和有关作业组长报告庄稼生长情况等。
    作业组建立以后，为了妥善解决重点活和一般活。急活和缓活的矛盾，不打乱劳动组织的秩序，他们采取了如下作法：在一般正常情况下，坚持以作业组为单位生产，分段承包，分段结算。如遇自然灾害和临时性的大型活路，则由小队统一抽调各作业组的劳力组成临时突击队，活路做完后，劳力仍回原作业组生产。各作业组在劳力减少期间，采取将承包的活路重新排队，明确主攻方面，优先保证重点活和季节性强的活。如前一段发生了干旱和虫灾，又要抢种双季晚稻和搞现有作物的培育管理，小队队委便把活路进行全面排队，抽了十七个劳力组成临时作业组，突击完成抗旱、除虫、送粮等五项急活，原固定作业组就集中力量搞抢插双季晚稻和田间培育管理等七项活路。十天来，已把受旱的一百二十三亩水旱田灌了一至两次水，完成了二万三千斤早稻余粮入库任务；六十二亩一季晚粳普遍追了十担肥，对七十二亩三类苗除追肥外还扯了草；以及完成了一百五十亩双季晚稻的抢插任务等。在安排主要力量保证主要活路完成的同时，又安排一定数量的劳力担负一般的活路。
    在评工记分方面，这个队采取的集体记工和个人计件相结合的方法。即：小队根据这段活路多少，按田亩多少，用定额算出工分分段包到每个作业组。作业组根据各种活路不同的特点，采用两种记工方法，一种是适合集体生产的活路如割谷、插秧……等，就采取集体包工，再由参与这项活的社员在总工分之内互相评议出每人每天应得的工分。另一种是适合于个人操作的活路，如割田边、推车、养牛……，则按定额直接将工分记到个人。由于评分记工合理，社员生产热情高涨，全小队原来不做事的六个附带劳力，也积极参加劳动。
    新华社济南电　山东肥城县城关公社十屯生产大队国屯小队把各项农活和劳力使用一次安排到霜降，分四段完成，段段有重点，步步向前赶，做到晚秋管的好，早秋收的好，秋种准备好。
    最近，国屯小队党支部召开了全体队干部会议，详细分析了秋季农忙形势。从现在到完成秋收秋种只有两个月，收、种、管各种农活都拥挤在一起，劳力显得特别紧张。现在，晚茬地瓜、玉米和棉花、秋菜都急需追肥、浇水、灭虫，部分早秋作物已开始收获，收获后必须立即耕地，还须提前作好秋种准备。队干部认为要完成这些任务，必须根据季节把农活、劳力作通盘考虑，制订一个全面计划，分段掌握，改变过去走一步安排一步的做法。通过排任务、算时间、查劳力，这个队把霜降以前两个月的农活分为四个阶段：白露以前以突击晚秋作物管理为重点，适时收好早秋；白露到秋分，以秋收秋耕为重点，继续加强地瓜和蔬菜的管理；秋分到寒露的重点是抢耕抢种；寒露到霜降是收地瓜，抢种晚麦。
    每段都根据农活的轻重缓急和劳力出勤情况加以具体安排，全部落实。在执行中，又根据气候和农活的变化，调配劳力和调整计划，使件件农活有人管。例如现在第一个小段计划已经开始执行，管好晚秋、收好早秋、采集饲草等十多种农活的季节性都很强。但是，整、半劳力加上能出勤的附属劳力一共只有六十六人，运肥追肥占用十六人，浇水占用二十二人，管理棉花十八人，收早秋和场间管理五人，菜园里还占着几个人，因此已经排上号的采集饲料、抢种晚菜等等农活便派不出人了。这时，队干部就逐事分析，结果找到管理棉田的专业队可以腾出空来兼管秋菜；借来一部抽水机浇地一百五十亩，又腾出一部分人力抢种晚菜，二万斤饲草的采集包给一百一十名小学生完成。这样一调配，大小农活以主带次，穿插进行，不仅完成计划有了保证，而且运肥突击组在完成秧田运肥计划后还可提前为秋种运肥五百车，使第二段的农活向前赶了一步。
    这个小队在制订计划中充分估计到可能遇到的临时困难，掌握留有余地的精神，以保证计划的实现。例如在劳力安排上，甚至连女社员的经期、孕期、哺育期都考虑到了。这样安排后，社员普遍感到切实可行，信心很足，干劲更大。小队干部的主动性、预见性也大大加强。（附图片）
