Using Local Materials, Transporting Wood with Wood
A Major Reform in Forest Area Transportation Tools

(Reported by this newspaper) The achievements of technological innovation and technological revolution by workers in various forest areas of Heilongjiang Province have played a huge role in production. The conventional practice of mobilizing rural manpower and horses to transport wood in the mountains every winter has been broken. The raw logs originally planned to be transported by animal power this winter are now being transported by mechanized and semi-mechanized tools for 55.4% of the total. The heavy physical labor of forestry production is gradually being replaced by mechanized and semi-mechanized tools.

In Heilongjiang Province, timber production generally involves felling in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, with raw logs piled up on the mountains. Only after snow and ice in the winter were several horses used to drag the logs down the mountain, taking advantage of the downward sliding force. In this way, every year it was necessary to mobilize 70,000 to 80,000 people and over 100,000 animals from the countryside. This not only reduced the rural labor force available for winter production, but also put pressure on the railway and forestry departments due to the sudden increase in human and animal food needing to be transported in a short time. Under these conditions, relying entirely on human and animal power for skidding and loading, it took an average of seven months or a year for a tree to go from being felled to being loaded and transported. Because raw logs were stockpiled on the mountains for a long time, they were exposed to wind, sun, rain, and insects, reducing the value of the timber.

In order to solve this problem, workers in various forest areas of Heilongjiang Province, during the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, focused on the skidding, stacking, and loading processes that required the most labor and had the highest labor intensity, and carried out technological innovation and technological revolution movements. Under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels in the forest areas, 300,000 forestry workers across the province created various advanced tools, realizing mechanized and semi-mechanized operations in all aspects of felling, skidding, stacking, loading, and transportation, and the workers' innovative creations were selected, finalized, and integrated into complete systems. In terms of skidding, forestry workers utilized the terrain and local materials to manufacture a large number of new tools that "transport wood with wood." On slopes with gradients of ten degrees or more, they used a steel cable automatic return flatcar and "wooden rail skids," on gentle slopes with gradients of less than ten degrees, they used wooden platform cars, and in swampy areas where rails could not be laid, they erected aerial ropeways. These new skidding tools do not require power, relying on the force of the loaded car going downhill to pull the empty car up the mountain with ropes. On flat mountain areas without gradients, they used "leap-forward flatcars," which have small front wheels and large rear wheels, and automatically move forward after being loaded with raw logs. In terms of loading and unloading, forestry workers created a complete set of loading and unloading machinery, such as loading frame poles, loading machines, and winch machines, enabling more than 40,000 loading workers across the province to use new tools for loading and promoted advanced experiences such as high platform loading.

The new skidding and loading tools created by workers in various forest areas of Heilongjiang Province have greatly improved skidding and loading efficiency. For example, new skidding tools increased skidding efficiency by 30% to 50% compared to using animal power, and in some cases, even more than doubled it. As a result, the task of skidding with animal power originally planned for this winter has already been half completed in the forest areas across the province. The heavy physical labor of manually lifting raw logs for loading and unloading has been basically eliminated. In the past, it took twelve people two and a half hours to load a train car of timber, but after using new loading tools, it only takes six people operating simple machinery thirty minutes to load it. Currently, 325 high platforms have also been built in various forest areas across the province, greatly facilitating loading work.

The major reforms in the skidding and loading processes in timber production in the forest areas of Heilongjiang Province are of great significance for the high-speed development of timber production. The emergence of these new tools has greatly saved rural labor. Taking the Songhua River Forest Area as an example, if the task of skidding 4.2 million cubic meters this year relied on animal power, it would be necessary to mobilize more than 40,000 horses and 35,000 laborers from the countryside. However, this year, this forest area is using a large number of new tools, reducing a large number of animal teams for skidding, and strongly supporting agricultural production. In addition, due to the realization of mechanized and semi-mechanized loading operations, loading workers have been freed from heavy physical labor, and 20,000 people have participated in new tasks such as the construction of new forest areas, comprehensive utilization of timber, forest management, and afforestation.

    就地取材  以木运木
    林区运输工具大改革
    本报讯　黑龙江省各林区职工，大搞采伐、集材技术革新、技术革命的成果，已在生产中发挥出巨大作用。历年冬季要动员农村人力、马匹上山运木材的常规，已被打破。原计划今年冬季用畜力运的原木，现在已被机械化、半机械化工具运了55.4％。林业生产的笨重体力劳动，已在逐步被机械化、半机械化工具所代替。
    黑龙江省林区木材生产，一般都是春、夏、秋三季采伐的，原木堆积在山上，等冬天下雪结冰之后，才用几匹大马，借着下山的滑力，把原木拉到山下，这样，每年都需要从农村动员七、八万人力，十万余匹畜力上山 ，不仅减少了农村冬季生产的劳畜力，还由于人的主副食品和马的草料陡然增加，要在短期内集中运输，给铁路部门和林业部门带来不少困难。在这种全靠人力、畜力集材、装车的条件下，一棵树木从伐倒到装车运走，平均需要七个月或一年的时间。由于原木在山上积压时间较久，风吹日晒，雨淋虫蚀，降低了木材使用价值。
    为了解决这个问题，黑龙江省各林区职工，在技术革新、技术革命运动中，针对着费劳动力最多，劳动强度最高的集材、归楞和装车等工序，开展了技术革新、技术革命运动。全省三十万林区职工，在林区各级党组织的领导下，创造出各种各样的先进工具，使采伐、集材、归楞、装车、运输等方面，全面实现了机械化、半机械化作业，并把职工的革新创造，经过选型、定型、配套成龙。在集材方面林区职工们利用山形地势，就地取材，制造出来大批“以木运木”的新工具，在山坡十度以上的山场，用一种钢索自动回空的平车和“木轨滑杠”，在十度以下的漫山坡用木制台车，在不能铺轨的沼泽地带，就架设空中索道。这些集材新工具，都不用动力，是靠那种重车下坡时的力量，用绳索把空车带上山去。在没有坡度的平坦山场，利用“跃进式平车” ，这种车是前轮小，后轮大，装上原木后，就自动的前进了。在装车和卸车方面，林业职工创造了整套的装车、卸车机械，像装车架杆、装车机、绞盘机等先进工具，使全省四万多名装车工人，使用新工具装车，并推广了高站台装车等先进经验。
    黑龙江省各林区职工创造的这些集材、装车新工具，大大提高了集材和装卸车效率。比如，新式集材工具使集材效率比用畜力集材提高30％—50％，有的竟提高一倍多。因而，全省林区计划今年冬季用畜力集材的任务，现在已完成了一半。人抬原木装车卸车的笨重体力劳动，已基本消灭了。过去装一节火车皮木材要用十二个人，两个半小时，使用新式装车工具后，只用六个人掌握土机械，三十分钟就装完了。目前，全省各林区还修建了三百二十五座高站台，大大便利了装车工作。
    黑龙江省林区木材生产上的集材、装车工序的重大改革，对高速度发展木材生产，有着极其重要的意义。这些新工具的出现，大大节省了农村的劳动力，就以松花江林区计算，今年的四百二十万立方米的集材任务，如靠畜力集材要从农村动员四万多匹马，和三万五千名劳力。但是，今年这个林区已在使用着大量的新式工具，减少了大批马套子集材，有力地支援了农业生产。另外，由于装车机械化、半机械化作业的实现，解放了双肩的装车工人，已有两万人参加了新林区的建设、木材综合利用、营林、造林等新的工作。（邢安领）（附图片）
