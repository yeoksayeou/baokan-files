Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu: Chengdu City, after launching technological innovation, has extracted a large number of people from the labor force saved, sending them up the mountains and down the mines to strengthen the production and construction work of iron and coal mines. This group of people is concentrating its efforts on expanding and building three new coal mines and one iron mine, and some of them are participating in the production of coal and ore.

This group of people comes from units in industry, capital construction, transportation, finance and trade, and urban people's communes. For example, Sichuan Province's Third Construction Engineering Company, through vigorous technological innovation and revolution, implemented the orbitalization and hoisting of on-site transportation, universally promoted mobile platforms, completely removed scaffolding, and reduced non-production personnel, thus extracting 500 laborers.

Chengdu City has extracted a large number of people to go up the mountains and down the mines, adopting the method of organizing teams according to systems, units, and mining areas. And according to the characteristics of various industries, they divide responsibilities and contract tasks, giving full play to the expertise and initiative of the people going up the mountains. The capital construction department is responsible for construction and installation engineering; the transportation department is responsible for transportation and communication; and the commercial department is responsible for life services. Each department divides tasks according to units, contracting for a mine, a road, or a project, and is responsible from start to finish. At the same time, in terms of personnel allocation, each unit takes into account the combination of cadres and workers, new workers and old workers, production workers and capital construction workers, and production personnel and life service personnel. The commercial department has extracted more than 800 employees, including branch secretaries, managers, accountants, cashiers, procurement, warehouse keepers and other cadres and service personnel, organized into a complete logistics supply system, and gone deep into the mines to ensure that the workers going up the mountain have food, clothing, supplies, and housing.

This group of people going up the mountains and down the mines has displayed a high degree of enthusiasm in production and construction. The more than 1,000 new miners supporting the Wenchuan Iron Mine, together with the old miners, in the first five days of August, increased the average daily footage driven by more than 5% compared to July. Fifty-six new miners were rated as production experts in the "learn from, compare with, catch up with, and help" production competition.

    向技术革命要劳动力
    成都抽出大批人力建设矿山
    据新华社成郁电　成都市从开展技术革新以后节约出的劳动力中，抽调大批人力上山下井，加强铁矿和煤矿的生产建设工作。这批人正集中力量扩建和新建三个煤矿和一个铁矿，有一部分人参加煤和矿石的生产。
    这批人来自工业、基本建设、交通运输、财贸和城市人民公社等单位。如四川省第三建筑工程公司通过大搞技术革新和技术革命，实行现场运输轨道化、吊装化，普遍推行活动平台、全部放下脚手架，以及减少非生产人员，就抽调出五百个劳动力。
    成都市抽调大批人力上山下井，采取了按系统、按单位、按矿区编队的办法。并根据各行各业的特点，分工包干，充分发挥上山人员的专长和主动精神。基本建设部门包建筑安装工程；交通运输部门包运输和通讯联络；商业部门包生活服务。各部门又按单位划分任务，包干一个矿井，一条道路，一项工程，从开工到完工负责到底。同时在人员配备方面，各单位都照顾到了干部和工人、新工人和老工人、生产工人和荃本建设工人、生产人员和生活服务人员的搭配。商业部门已抽调了八百多个职工，包括支部书记、经理、会计、出纳、采购、保管等干部和服务人员，组织成一个完整的后勤供应体系，深入矿场，使上山工人有吃，有穿，有用，有住。
    这批上山下井人员在生产建设中发挥了高度的积极性。支援汶川铁矿的一千多个新矿工，同老矿工一道，在8月份的头五天中，平均每天掘进进尺比7月份提高了5％以上。有五十六个新矿工在“学比赶帮”的生产竟赛中被评为生产能手。
