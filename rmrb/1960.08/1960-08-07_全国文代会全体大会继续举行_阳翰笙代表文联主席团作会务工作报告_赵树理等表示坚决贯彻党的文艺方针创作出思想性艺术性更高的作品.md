The Third National Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers continued its plenary session this afternoon.

Yang Hansheng, Secretary-General of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, delivered a work report to all representatives on behalf of the Presidium of the Second National Committee of the Federation. In his report, Yang Hansheng introduced the development of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles since the Second National Congress in 1953. He summarized the work of the Federation in promoting political and ideological struggles in literary and art circles, implementing the Party's literary and art policy, going deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers, strengthening the study of political theory and enriching scientific and cultural knowledge, participating in the struggle against imperialist aggression, defending world peace, engaging in foreign literary and artistic exchanges, and organizing art observations. He also put forward future tasks.

After Yang Hansheng's report, the meeting moved into general speeches. Today's speakers included representatives Zhao Shuli, Fan Xuepeng, Zhao Dingxin, Wang Shaotang, and Kang Langshuai. In their speeches, they expressed deep gratitude to the Party for its cultivation and education. Based on their own experiences, they discussed their achievements and gains in literary creation, long-term immersion in life, ideological transformation, and opposition to revisionism. They emphasized the need to resolutely follow the Party's literary and art policy and create works with higher ideological and artistic quality.

Writer Zhao Shuli, in his speech, introduced his experience in going deep among workers and peasants in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. His main experience is that going to the countryside must be "long-lasting," requiring long-term immersion in life. Only through prolonged engagement can love for the masses be generated, and only then can a comprehensive and profound understanding of the lives and struggles of the masses be achieved, making it possible to write solid works. He said that in the long run, we should also study the Party Central Committee's policies and guidelines, and consider issues from a national perspective; read more reports on rural conditions in other regions, respect the work achievements of others, and constantly learn from the strengths of various regions, so that we can understand real life both deeply and comprehensively.

Fifty-two-year-old film actress Fan Xuepeng spoke emotionally about her completely different experiences before and after liberation. Before liberation, she acted in "martial arts films." When she turned thirty, the boss thought she was too old and kicked her out of the film company, leaving her unemployed and forgotten in the film industry. After liberation, the Party restored her artistic life. She played important roles in films such as "You Chase, I Catch," "Iron and Steel Family," and "A Riot of Color is Always Spring," which reflected the Great Leap Forward and portrayed workers, peasants, and soldiers. She is proud to be able to contribute her strength to socialist construction. She sincerely thanked the Party for its care and cultivation of literary and art workers.

Zhao Dingxin, a representative from Beijing, spoke about the creative achievements and the role in educating the people and打击 [dǎ jī - strike, combat, attack] the enemy achieved by the majority of writers and artists in Beijing due to the implementation of Chairman Mao's literary and art thought and policy. Zhao Dingxin introduced Beijing's experiences in going deep into life, implementing a combination of long-term and short-term stays, and combining fixed-point deployment with district-based guidance, based on the different characteristics of literary and art workers, as well as experiences in developing mass creation.

Wang Shaotang, an old Yangzhou storytelling artist, introduced in his speech how the Party helped him record, sort out, and publish the storytelling "Wu Song," which had been passed down for generations and incorporated the hard work of countless artists and the masses. He said excitedly that the publication of this work of more than one million words vividly illustrates the Party's emphasis on national literary and artistic heritage, its care and cultivation of old artists, and is the result of the correct policy proposed by the Party of critically inheriting tradition, "taking its essence and discarding its dross."

Kang Langshuai, a Dai singer from Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, introduced the situation of ethnic minority literary and art workers in the border areas of the motherland. He said that studying Mao Zedong's literary and art thought has become a climax among Dai singers. They are singing with the working people on the agricultural front and at various construction sites, working and singing together, creating while working, and singing out our great real life and the wishes and ideals of our nation.

The general speeches will continue tomorrow. (Attached picture)

    全国文代会全体大会继续举行
    阳翰笙代表文联主席团作会务工作报告
    赵树理等表示坚决贯彻党的文艺方针创作出思想性艺术性更高的作品
    据新华社6日讯　中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会，今天下午继续举行全体大会。
    全国文联秘书长阳翰笙代表文联第二届全国委员会主席团向全体代表作了会务工作报告。阳翰笙在报告中，介绍了1953年召开全国第二次文代大会以来全国文联组织的发展情况，总结了六年多来全国文联在推动文艺界开展政治斗争和思想斗争、贯彻执行党的文艺方针、深入工农兵群众、加强政治理论学习和丰富科学文化知识、参加反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平及对外文学艺术交流和组织艺术观摩等方面工作情况，并提出今后任务。
    阳翰笙报告后，转入大会发言。今天在会上发言的有赵树理、范雪朋、赵鼎新、王少堂、康朗甩五位代表。他们在发言中，表示深深感谢党的培养和教育，并以自己的亲身体会，从进行文学创作、长期深入生活，进行思想改造、反对修正主义等各方面的成绩和收获，谈到必须坚决遵循党的文艺方针，创作出思想性、艺术性更高的作品。
    作家赵树理在发言中，介绍了自己遵照毛主席的指示深入工农群众的经验，他的主要体会是到农村去必须“久”，要长期深入生活，要久才会产生对群众的爱，要久才能对群众的生活和斗争认识得全面和深刻，然后才有可能写出扎实的作品。他说，长期下乡，还应该多学习党中央的方针政策，遇事从全国着眼；多读其它各地区农村情况的报道，尊重人家的工作成绩，时时学习各个地区的长处，使我们对现实生活了解得既深入又全面。
    五十二岁的电影演员范雪朋，在会上激动地谈到自己在解放前后截然不同的遭遇。解放前她演“武侠片”，三十岁时老板嫌她老了，把她踢出电影公司门外，失了业，在电影界被人遗忘了。解放后，党又使她重新恢复了艺术生命，在“你追我赶”、“钢铁世家”、“万紫千红总是春”等反映大跃进、表现工农兵的影片中担任了重要的角色。她为自己能在社会主义建设中贡献自己的力量而自豪。她衷心感谢党对文艺工作者的关怀和培养。
    北京市代表赵鼎新在发言中，谈到北京市的大多数作家、艺术家，由于贯彻执行了毛主席的文艺思想和文艺方针，而取得的创作成就及所起的教育人民、打击敌人的作用。赵鼎新介绍了北京文艺界在深入生活方面，根据文艺工作者的不同特点，实行长期下放与短期下放相结合、定点下放与包区辅导相结合的经验和开展群众创作等方面经验。
    扬州评话老艺人王少堂，在发言中介绍了党怎样帮助他纪录、整理、出版了祖传几辈、集中了无数艺人、群众心血的评话“武松”。他激动地说，这部一百多万字作品的出版，生动地说明党对民族文艺遗产的重视、对老艺人的关怀培养，它是党所提出的批判地继承传统，“取其精华，去其糟粕”正确方针的成果。
    来自云南西双版纳的傣族歌手康朗甩，在会上介绍了祖国边疆少数民族文艺工作者的情况。他说，学习毛泽东文艺思想已经在傣族歌手中形成高潮。他们正在农业战线和各个建设工地上和劳动人民同劳动同歌唱，边劳动边创作，唱出了我们伟大的现实生活和我们民族的愿望和理想。
    明天继续进行大会发言。（附图片）
