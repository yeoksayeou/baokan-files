Xinhua News Agency Report: In the first half of this year, regions across the country saved a total of over 91 million meters of cotton cloth, and accumulated a wealth of good experience in saving cotton cloth. Currently, enterprises that use cotton cloth and cotton yarn as raw materials or auxiliary materials are, based on the already acquired rich experience, launching a new upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution with saving yarn and cloth or using substitutes as the main content. A social movement focused on improving clothing design, tailoring techniques, and refurbishing old clothes to save yarn and cloth is also gradually taking shape.

In the past period, factories and mining enterprises in various regions created the following effective good experiences in saving cotton cloth: First, while paying attention to product quality and ensuring product applicability, they tried to save yarn and cloth or use substitutes, such as using paper made from corn husks, cotton stalk skins, and bamboo shoot shells instead of cotton cloth to manufacture insulation boards and axle tiles, and using straw mats and reed mats instead of cloth for windmills or sails. Second, according to the needs of the garment industry and the opinions of consumers, cotton cloth specifications were appropriately improved to eliminate the waste of some cotton cloths that were too wide or too dense. Third, to ensure product usage efficiency, the method of processing raw materials was improved during the production process, changing the material quota for yarn and cloth or improving the utilization rate of yarn and cloth. Fourth, packaging cloth such as flour bags and sugar bags were organized for recycling. Fifth, the management methods of work clothes and labor protection products were improved, the style of work clothes was innovated, and the service life of work clothes was extended. Sixth, temporary public cloth and cotton products were rented out. Seventh, all small scraps, leftover cotton yarn, and recycled waste cloth were fully utilized to make various labor protection products, children's products, and small commodities.

In terms of social cloth saving, the experience of "two dragons" has been widely promoted in various regions. One is called "tighten, alter, repair, comprehensively utilize, measure, and cut." "Tighten" means arranging closely and calculating carefully so that fabrics are fully and rationally utilized. This is an advanced tailoring method created by the national labor model Luo Fafu. Using this method to tailor clothes can ensure that the specifications and quality remain unchanged, saving one or two chi (Chinese feet) of cloth per garment. This experience has been promoted in eighteen large and medium-sized cities across the country. "Alter" means improving the style of civilian clothing and improving the design based on the principles of beauty, elegance, applicability, and consideration of mass habits. "Repair" means universally carrying out dismantling, washing, sewing, mending, making large things small, and refurbishing old things, which can not only make full use of old clothing materials and save new cotton cloth but also establish a social ethos of diligence and thrift among the broad masses of people. "Comprehensively utilize" means comprehensively utilizing waste, old, edge, and corner materials to make various daily-use small commodities. "Measure" means calculating materials and selling cloth according to the standard of rational cutting materials based on the customer's figure, avoiding the waste of generous allowances. "Cut" means cutting the cotton cloth to be sold into garment pieces. The advantage is that it can promote new cloth-saving styles and advanced tailoring techniques, which are more suitable for customers than selling ready-made clothes, reduce the public's cutting time, and eliminate scraps of cloth.

The other "two dragons" experience promoted in social cloth saving is to contract from selling cloth and measuring clothes to cutting and sewing, all the way through to the end. When selling cloth, cotton cloth shop assistants measure customers' clothes according to the new cutting method and take orders, and then send them to the processing factory for cutting and sewing. The advantage of this is that cotton cloth shops and garment factories cooperate closely, adopting the same cloth-use standards, eliminating the waste of generous allowances.

    上半年全国节约九千多万米棉布
    大兴勤俭之风大搞技术革命积累了合理用布的丰富经验
    新华社讯　今年上半年全国各地共节约了九千一百多万米棉布，并且创造了很多节约棉布的好经验。目前，各地以棉布、棉纱为原料或辅助原料的企业根据已经取得的丰富经验，又掀起了以节约纱布或采用代用品为主要内容的技术革新和技术革命高潮，以改进服装设计、裁剪技术和翻新补旧为中心的社会节约纱布运动，也在逐步形成。
    在过去一段时间里，各地厂矿企业在节约棉布方面创造了以下一些行之有效的好经验：一，在注意产品质量，保证产品适用的原则下，设法节省纱布或采用代用品，如利用玉米皮、棉秆皮、笋壳造的纸代替棉布制造绝缘板和轴瓦，用草席、苇席代替风车用布或船帆等；二，根据服装行业生产的需要和消费者的意见，适当改进棉布规格，消除某些棉布幅度过宽或过密的浪费；三，保证产品使用效能，在生产过程中改进原料的处理方法，改变纱布的用料定额或提高纱布利用率；四，组织包装用布如面袋、糖袋等回收利用；五，改进工作服和劳保用品的管理方法，革新工作服的式样，延长工作服使用年限；六，出租临时性公用布和棉布制品；七，充分利用一切碎小零料、下脚棉纱和回收废旧布等，用来制作各种劳保用品、儿童用品和小商品。
    在社会节约用布方面，各地普遍推行了两条龙的经验。一条叫紧、改、修、综、量、裁。“紧”就是紧密安排，精打细算，使布料得到充分合理的使用。这是全国劳动模范骆法福创造的先进裁剪法，采用这个办法裁衣服，能保证规格质量不变，每套衣服节约一两尺布。这个经验已经在全国十八个大中城市推广。“改”就是根据美观、大方、适用和照顾群众习惯的原则，改进民用服装的样式，改进设计。“修”就是普遍开展拆洗缝补、大改小、旧翻新的业务，既可充分利用旧衣料，节约新棉布，又可在广大人民群众中树立勤俭节约的社会风尚。“综”就是综合利用废、旧、边、角料，拼制各种日用小商品。“量”就是售布时根据顾客身材，按合理裁剪用料的标准算料售布，避免宽打窄用的浪费现象。“裁”就是将要销售的棉布裁成衣片出售。它的好处是能推广新式省布式样和先进裁剪技术，比卖成衣更适合顾客身材，减少群众裁剪时间，消灭零头布。
    在社会节约用布方面推广的另外一条龙的经验是，从售布、量衣到裁剪、缝制，一条龙包干到底。棉布店营业员在售布时就为顾客按新裁剪法量衣、接活，然后负责送到加工厂去裁剪缝制。这样做的好处是棉布商店和服装工厂密切协作，采用同样用布标准，消灭宽打窄用的浪费现象。
