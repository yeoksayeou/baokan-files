Since the beginning of summer, the number of haircut customers has greatly increased, to the point where some barbershops cannot cope even without taking days off. Customers have many complaints, and the service staff are also very distressed. The Party branch of the Xinhua Barbershop on Nanjing West Road in Shanghai mobilized all service staff to discuss solutions together. Everyone agreed that the main reason for the chaos was the improper arrangement of work and personnel. Usually, the busiest times for barbershops are in the morning and evening, but during these times, staff are often busy with meetings, physical exercise, or reading newspapers and studying. This reduces the manpower available during the busiest business hours. In addition, there were too many staff who were detached from or semi-detached from production. Out of the 22 employees in the shop, only 13 or 14 actually participated in production. Furthermore, there were too many meetings, and the meetings were too long, which also took up a lot of time.

In response to these problems, they took active reform measures. First, according to the business's busy and slack periods, they adopted a "two-days-on-one-day-concentrated-off" method, dividing the staff into three groups. Some people had three to four hours of rest in the morning and at noon, and all of them would concentrate after 4:00 PM to handle business. Staff detached from production were basically eliminated, and the manager also participated in half-day labor during the busiest business hours. Necessary meetings were also held during business breaks as much as possible, and preparations were made in advance to shorten meeting times.

After they took these methods, the time for customers to get haircuts and the working hours of the service staff were shortened. (Zhang Yiming, Da Zhang)

### 等理发的时间缩短了

    等理发的时间缩短了
    入夏以来，由于理发顾客大大增加，以致有的理发馆即使不休息也应付不过来。顾客意见很多，服务员也很苦恼。上海南京西路新华理发店党支部发动全体服务员共同讨论解决办法。大家一致认为，工作和人员力量安排得不得当，是造成忙乱的主要原因。理发业通常最忙的时间，是早上和晚上，但是在这两段时间里，他们经常有人忙着开会、体育锻炼或读报学习。这就使营业最忙时人手反而减少。此外，脱离生产或半脱离生产人员太多，全店二十二个从业人员，实际参加生产的只有十三四个。再加会议较多，会开的又长，也占去了不少时间。
    针对这些问题，他们采取了积极的改革措施。首先，根据业务忙闲规律，采取了“二休一集中”的办法，将人员分成三批，上午、中午都有一些人有三四小时的休息时间，到下午四点以后全部集中，应付营业。脱离生产人员基本取消了，经理在业务最忙时也参加半天劳动。必要开的会，也尽量利用业务空隙的时间开，并且事先作好准备，缩短开会时间。
    他们采取了这些方法后，原来顾客理发的时间和服务员的工作时间都缩短了。　（张一鸣、大章）
