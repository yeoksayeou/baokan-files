Let More Wild Plants Participate in Socialist Construction

Good news comes from the northernmost part of our country: Heilongjiang Province’s “Small Summer Harvest” movement has achieved initial results. Commune members in various places have extracted a large amount of wealth from the mountains and fields. Many counties have collected hundreds of thousands of catties of wild plants and processed them into canvas, pulp, feed, wine, oil, and more.

Similar good news comes from the southernmost part of our country: many areas in Yunnan Province have also launched a "Small Summer Harvest" movement. Wen Shan County alone collected more than four million catties of various wild raw materials in half a month and has already processed 150,000 catties of fiber, 170,000 catties of tannin extract, 17,000 catties of starch, and more than 3,000 catties of essential oils.

From south to north, the mountainous areas and grasslands that occupy a large area of our country are home to a large number of wild plants. From summer to autumn, a large number of wild plants mature in the mountains and fields every day. According to preliminary calculations in Heilongjiang Province, if the "Small Summer Harvest" movement is carried out well throughout the province, the comprehensive utilization of only seven categories and forty items can be worth about 500 million yuan. According to preliminary statistics in Yunnan Province, there are more than 940 major varieties of wild plants with utilization value, of which 185 can be collected in large quantities in summer. These things can be eaten, worn, used, exported, and used for medical treatment. They are indispensable for production and construction and people's lives, and they are an indispensable supplement to the industrial raw materials of large-field production. Generally speaking, these plants do not need to be planted or managed much. As long as they are collected and processed in time, they are the wealth of the people. However, there are many varieties, they are scattered and fragmented, and if they are not harvested when they are ripe, they will be wasted. Some of them will quickly rot and become useless if they are not processed immediately after harvesting. For tens of thousands of years, most of them could only grow and die on their own. Only the people's communes can expand the strength of the people to the field of large-scale collection and processing of wild plants, allowing them to come out and participate in the glorious cause of building socialism.

To do a good job in collecting wild plants, we must first conduct a detailed investigation and research, and understand the situation in several aspects clearly: What wild plants are there locally? What is the yield of each? How much is in the distant mountains, and how much is nearby? How much is concentrated in production areas, and how much is scattered? When do various wild plants mature? Which ones are currently most needed for industrial and agricultural production and people's lives? How many people are needed to collect them? What is the current technical strength for identification, collection, and processing? How can the collection time be arranged to avoid conflicting with field agricultural activities? Which wild plants are "out of season," and must be concentrated on for a blitz? Which ones can be collected later or regularly? Which ones can be collected in conjunction with other agricultural activities, grazing work, and forestry work? Which ones must use able-bodied labor, and which ones can use the old and weak labor? Which ones can be collected by workers transferred from the units that use the raw materials? All of these must be detailed, analyzed specifically, classified, and ranked. When the entire summer and autumn production activities are ranked, the wild plants are ranked, and the labor force is ranked, the most favorable time for collecting wild plants can be found. We can then formulate labor plans in accordance with the policy of taking grain as the key link and developing diversified operations in an all-round way. We can use labor in the most economical and effective way, and go to the high mountains and grasslands whenever there is an opportunity, working hard and returning with a full load.

To enable wild plants to serve socialism more and better, it is not only necessary to do a good job in collecting, but also to do a good job in purchasing and processing. Since most wild plants grow in high mountains, valleys, and deep grasslands, to do a good job in collecting, we must also do a good job in transportation and living services. This requires industrial, commercial, transportation, medical, and health departments to regard supporting and participating in the collection of wild plants as an integral part of supporting agriculture. During the period of concentrated efforts to collect, collection tools must go up the mountains, processing machinery must go up the mountains, purchasing personnel must go up the mountains, technical guidance must go up the mountains, transportation tools must go up the mountains, and living services must go up the mountains. It is especially important for processing machinery to go up the mountains, which can greatly reduce the loss of raw materials that must be processed as soon as possible and can also greatly save transportation capacity. Cooking work going up the mountains can also be combined with some processing work that requires steaming and heating, saving manpower and fuel. Medical work going up the mountains is of great help to the prevention and treatment of diseases of the collection army and the technical guidance of medicinal plant collection and processing. With collection, purchase, processing, and transportation proceeding simultaneously, the broad masses of commune members will more directly see the significance of the labor results of collecting wild plants to socialist construction and improving their own lives, and their enthusiasm for collection will be even higher. People can also learn more about the great significance of the worker-peasant alliance and the mutual combination and mutual promotion of industry and agriculture.

The need for industrial raw materials is constantly growing. Now, the sowing season for industrial raw material crops in most areas has passed. To increase the production of more industrial raw materials, on the one hand, we rely on greatly increasing the yield per unit area of crops, and on the other hand, we rely on vigorously carrying out the collection of wild plants. Now, we must do a good job in the "Small Summer Harvest" of collecting wild plants, and at the same time, we must actively prepare to launch a "Small Autumn Harvest" movement that is larger in scale than last year. This matter concerns the overall situation of national economic development and must not be taken lightly because it is "wild" and "small."

### 让更多野生植物参加社会主义建设

    让更多野生植物参加社会主义建设
    一个好消息来自祖国的最北方：黑龙江省“小夏收”运动初获战果，各地公社社员向山野索取了大量的财富，许多县都已经采集了野生植物几十万斤，而且加工成了许多帆布、纸浆、饲料、酒和油等等。
    同样的好消息来自祖国的最南方：云南省许多地区也展开了“小夏收”运动，只是一个文山县半个月里就采集了各种野生原料四百多万斤，并且已经加工出来纤维十五万斤、栲胶十七万斤、淀粉一万七千斤、芳香油三千多斤。
    从南到北，占我国国土很大面积的山区和草原，都生长着大量的野生植物。从夏到秋，每天都有大量的野生植物在山野里成熟。据黑龙江省初步计算，全省如果把“小夏收”运动开展得好，仅把七大类四十大项品种加以综合利用，价值就可以有五亿元左右。据云南省初步统计，野生植物中有利用价值的大宗品种就有九百四十多种，其中在夏季可以大量采集的有一百八十五种。这些东西能吃、能穿、能用、能出口、能治病，是生产建设和人民生活中不可缺少的东西，是大田生产的工业原料的不可缺少的补充。这些植物，一般地说，不用种植，不用多管，只要及时地采集和加工，就是人民的财富；可是，品种繁多，零星分散，而且熟了不收，就会白丢，其中有些收了不立即加工，也会很快腐烂无用。多少万年以来，它们绝大部分只能在那里自生自灭；只有人民公社才可能把人的力量扩展到大规模采集和加工野生植物的领域，让它们出来参加建设社会主义的光荣事业。
    要把采集野生植物的工作做好，先要细致地作一番调查研究工作，把几个方面的情况了解得清清楚楚：当地都有些什么野生植物？每一种的产量有多少？远山有多少，近处有多少？产地比较集中的有多少，零星分散的有多少？各种各样的野生植物在什么时候成熟？哪几种是工农业生产上和人民生活上当前最需要的？需要多少人去采集？现有的鉴别、采集、加工的技术力量如何？采集的时间怎样安排才可以和田间农事活动时间错开？哪些野生植物是“过时不候”的，必须集中力量突击？哪一些可以迟采集或者经常采集？哪一些可以同其他农事活动、放牧工作和林业工作结合进行采集？哪些必须用青壮劳力，哪些可以用老弱劳力？哪些可以由使用原料的单位抽调工人上山采集？凡此等等，都要详细占有材料，进行具体分析，分分类，排排队。整个夏秋生产活动排了队，野生植物排了队，劳动力排了队，就能把采集野生植物的最有利的时机找出来，就可以按照以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针制定劳动规划，就可以最节约最有效地使用劳动力，一有时机就上高山、入草原，大干特干，满载而归。
    要使野生植物更多更好地为社会主义服务，不只要把采集工作做好，还得把收购和加工工作做好。由于大部分野生植物是生长在高山大谷和草原深处，要把采集工作做好，还必须做好运输和生活服务等项工作。这就要求工业、商业、交通运输、医药卫生等部门，把支援和参加采集野生植物的工作作为支援农业的一个组成部分。在集中力量突击采集的时期，采集工具要上山，加工机具要上山，收购人员要上山，技术指导要上山，运输工具要上山，生活服务要上山。加工机具上山特别重要，这既可以使必须尽快加工的原料大大减少损失，还可以大大节约运输力。炊事工作上山，也可以同一部分需要蒸煮加热的加工工作结合起来，节约人力和燃料。医药工作上山，对采集大军的防病治病和药用植物采集、加工的技术指导都大有帮助。随采集、随收购、随加工、随运输，广大社员群众更直接地看到采集野生植物的劳动成果对社会主义建设的意义和改善自己的生活的意义，采集的积极性就会更加高涨，人们也可以在这中间更多地了解到工农联盟和工业农业互相结合互相促进的重大意义。
    工业原料的需要在不断增长。现在，绝大部分地区工业原料作物的播种季节已经过去；要增产更多的工业原料，一方面靠大力提高作物的单位面积产量，另方面就靠大力开展野生植物的采集工作。现在要作好采集野生植物的“小夏收”，同时还要积极准备开展一个比去年的规模更大的“小秋收”运动。事关国民经济发展的全局，决不可因其“野”和“小”而等闲视之。
