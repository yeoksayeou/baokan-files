Xinhua News Agency, August 14th. Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese-African People's Solidarity Committee; the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; the All-China Women's Federation; the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation have recently sent telegrams to relevant Korean organizations, warmly congratulating the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese-African People's Solidarity Committee jointly sent a telegram to the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace and the Korean-African People's Solidarity Committee, praising the great victories achieved by the Korean people in opposing American imperialism's armed aggression and in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The telegram said that China and Korea are as close as lips and teeth and share weal and woe. The friendship between our two peoples, forged in blood in the common struggle against imperialist aggression, is constantly consolidated and developed in the common cause of defending world peace and building socialism. On the occasion of welcoming the glorious festival of the Korean people, we would like to solemnly reiterate that the Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. We will always unite with the fraternal Korean people, together with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to encourage and support each other, advance hand in hand, and fight to the end to completely defeat the imperialist war and aggression group headed by the United States, to victoriously build socialism-communism, and to defend Asian and world peace.

Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said in his congratulatory telegram to Li Hyo-sun, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions, that the heroic Korean people, in accelerating socialist construction, have displayed soaring revolutionary vigor and victoriously completed the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in just two and a half years. At present, the "Chollima Work Team" movement vigorously unfolding in various parts of Korea is playing a huge role in accelerating the socialist construction of your country and raising the communist consciousness and cultural and technical level of the working people.

The telegram said that the Chinese workers and people have always regarded every achievement of the fraternal Korean people as their own achievement, as a contribution to strengthening the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and defending world peace, and are sincerely delighted and encouraged by it.

The All-China Women's Federation said in its congratulatory telegram to the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's Union that Korean women have made important contributions both in the difficult years of war and in the great cause of socialist construction. Your achievements and victories have added important strength to the cause of defending world peace and promoting human progress, and we are delighted and encouraged by the victories you have achieved.

The telegram pointed out that the friendship between the people and women of China and Korea is unbreakable. Let the people and women of our two countries unite more closely in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and strive for the common cause of opposing the aggression and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States, defending world peace, and building socialism.

The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation jointly sent a congratulatory telegram to the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League and the Korean Student Committee, saying that the great achievements and prosperous situation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stand in sharp contrast to the dark and miserable situation in southern Korea, which is still under the rule of American imperialism and its lackeys. Through their own experience, the people of South Korea are increasingly aware that American imperialism is the root cause of all their suffering and have launched a heroic struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys. American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of China and Korea and the people of the world. The Chinese people have always regarded your struggle as our struggle. The Chinese people and youth resolutely support the heroic struggle of the South Korean people against the rule of American imperialism and its lackeys, and resolutely support the just struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. We firmly believe that final victory will surely belong to the Korean people.

The telegram wishes the fraternal friendship between the people and youth of China and Korea, forged in blood, will last forever!

Xinhua News Agency, August 14th. The Sino-Korean Friendship Association sent a telegram to the Korean-Chinese Friendship Association yesterday, warmly congratulating the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

The congratulatory telegram said that on the occasion of the great festival of the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea, please accept our warm and sincere congratulations and, through you, to the fraternal Korean people.

The telegram said that the Korean people have demonstrated unparalleled revolutionary spirit and heroic spirit in the just war against American imperialist aggression and in the vigorous socialist construction, and have achieved extremely great victories. The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the great achievements made by the Korean people. The telegram said that the fighting friendship between the people of China and Korea, forged in the common struggle, is developing and consolidating day by day. Now the Chinese people are holding the Sino-Korean Friendship Week, celebrating the festival of the Korean people as if it were their own. We believe that through the activities of the Sino-Korean Friendship Week, the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people will further radiate brilliant light.

    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国亚非团结委员会联名打电报给朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会和朝鲜亚非团结委员会，赞扬了朝鲜人民在反对美帝国主义武装侵略，和在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得的伟大胜利。
    电报说，中朝两国唇齿相依、休戚相关，我们两国人民在反抗帝国主义侵略的共同斗争中用鲜血凝成的友谊，在保卫世界和平、建设社会主义的共同事业中不断巩固和发展。在迎接朝鲜人民光荣节日的时候，我们愿庄严重申：中国人民坚决支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的正义斗争，我们将永远同兄弟的朝鲜人民团结一起，同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国一起，互相鼓舞、互相支持，携手前进，为彻底击败以美国为首的帝国主义战争侵略集团，为胜利建设社会主义—共产主义，为保卫亚洲和世界和平奋斗到底。
    中华全国总工会主席刘宁一给朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会委员长李孝淳的贺电说，英勇的朝鲜人民在加速社会主义建设中，发挥了冲天的革命干劲，只用两年半的时间就胜利提前完成了第一个五年计划。目前，在朝鲜各地轰轰烈烈开展的“千里马作业班”运动，对加速贵国的社会主义建设，提高劳动人民的共产主义觉悟和文化技术水平起着巨大的作用。
    电报说，中国工人和人民始终把兄弟的朝鲜人民的每项成就都看成是自己的成就，看成是对加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力和保卫世界和平的贡献，并为之感到由衷的欢欣鼓舞。

    中国共产主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会联名给朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会和朝鲜学生委员会的贺电说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的伟大成就和欣欣向荣的局面，同至今仍在美帝及其走狗统治下的朝鲜南部的暗无天日的悲惨境地，形成了鲜明的对照。南朝鲜人民通过自己的切身体会，越来越认识到美帝国主义是他们遭受一切灾难的根源，为反对美帝国主义及其走狗展开了英勇的斗争。美帝国主义是中朝两国人民和全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。中国人民从来把你们的斗争看作是我们的斗争。中国人民和青年坚决支持南朝鲜人民反对美帝及其走狗统治的英勇斗争，坚决支持朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一的正义斗争。我们坚信，最后胜利一定属于朝鲜人民。
    电报祝中朝两国人民和青年用鲜血凝成的兄弟友谊万古长青！
