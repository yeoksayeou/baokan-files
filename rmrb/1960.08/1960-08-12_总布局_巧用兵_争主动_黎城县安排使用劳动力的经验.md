Overall Layout, Skillful Use of Forces, Striving for Initiative
—Experiences of Licheng County in Arranging and Using Labor Force
    Hao Zhan'ao, Bi Zhimin
    Licheng County, Shanxi Province, conscientiously explored, researched, and mastered the laws of industrial and agricultural production and capital construction. According to the general policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the entire national economy, and prioritizing production, agriculture, and grain, the county rationally arranged the labor force, using it flexibly and skillfully, thereby gaining the initiative in using labor. Consequently, all tasks were proactive, and agricultural production achieved bumper harvests year after year. Industries, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, diversified management, short-distance transportation, capital construction, and other production and construction undertakings also developed rapidly and proportionally.
    Exploring Laws, Gaining Initiative
    After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, all production and construction undertakings in Licheng County, including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fishery, industry, short-distance transportation, and capital construction, made comprehensive leaps forward. In less than two years, the county's total industrial and agricultural output value increased by more than 50%. With the high-speed development of production and construction, the labor force became increasingly insufficient. How to rationally arrange and use the labor force became the key to ensuring the high-speed, proportional, and comprehensive leap forward of all production and construction undertakings.
    How to comprehensively and rationally arrange and use the labor force? Only by studying and exploring the laws of various production and construction undertakings and mastering and applying these laws can we fully exert people's subjective initiative and grasp the initiative in using the labor force. Therefore, leading cadres and the masses in Licheng County conducted conscientious exploration and research on the laws of various production and construction undertakings in the county.
    First, agricultural production: ① is the foundation of the entire national economy. If agricultural production (especially grain production) is not done well, everything will be affected, and the entire production and construction undertaking cannot advance by leaps and bounds. ② is highly seasonal, and delaying the farming season will affect yields. In particular, during the spring plowing and sowing, the "three summers" (summer harvesting, summer planting, summer hoeing) and the "three autumns" (autumn harvesting, autumn planting, autumn plowing), delaying for a few days will be punished by nature. ③ is greatly affected by natural disasters, especially the spring drought in April, the hail disaster in June, the "bottleneck" drought in July, and wind disasters, which are the most harmful to crops. Labor use is unstable. When the weather is favorable, less labor is required; when disasters occur, more labor is required. ④ The growing periods of major crops are roughly the same, farming activities are very concentrated, time-sensitive, and less flexible; labor use is very uneven. The amount of labor used during spring plowing and sowing, the "three summers," and the "three autumns" accounts for about 70%-75% of the total annual agricultural labor. ⑤ The production cycle is long, and the intermittence seems great on the surface, but in fact, each link of production is closely connected. If one link is not tightly grasped, the yield will be affected. ⑥ It takes two years to grow one year's crops, the production preparation time is long, and everything must be prepared for the next step. If there is a deficit in one year, it will take several years to catch up. In terms of labor use, a considerable proportion of professional teams must be maintained year-round. ⑦ is closely related to other production (industry, animal husbandry, capital construction, etc.). A bumper harvest in agricultural production is not only determined by agricultural production itself. When arranging labor, we must not only look at agricultural production but also take into account other production.
    Second, commune industry: is closely related to agricultural production, production is generally stable, and labor use is relatively stable; but it can also be flexible. When there is more labor, it can be done on a large scale; when there is less labor, it can be done on a small scale.
    Third, animal husbandry: production is relatively stable, labor is fixed, and mobility is not great; but it can also do some farm work concurrently.
    Fourth, forestry: is highly seasonal, mainly relying on short-term assaults. Labor use is very concentrated. The amount of labor used during spring afforestation before and after Qingming Festival and the forestry harvest season before and after the autumn harvest accounts for about 80%-85% of the total annual forestry labor.
    Fifth, sideline occupations: In addition to perennial workshops and short-distance transportation professional teams, they mainly rely on assaults during the slack farming season before spring and after autumn and interspersed with agricultural production gaps. Labor use is highly flexible, making it easy to organize assaults.
    Sixth, capital construction: mainly creates conditions for the further development of agricultural production, concentrated before spring and after autumn. The amount of labor used in the first and fourth quarters accounts for about 70%-75% of the total annual capital construction labor.
    Taking Stock, Comprehensive Arrangement
    While exploring the laws of various production and construction undertakings, Licheng County also conducted investigations and research on the county's labor force and the laws of labor use over the years.
    The county has a total of more than 36,200 full and semi-laborers, including 15,500 male full laborers, 9,898 female full laborers, 5,543 male semi-laborers, and 5,342 female semi-laborers. Each laborer works labor days per year: 350 for male full laborers, 270 for female full laborers, 300 for male semi-laborers, and 200 for female semi-laborers, totaling more than 10.83 million. In addition, the county also has 8,272 auxiliary laborers, who can work about 1 million labor days a year. In total, the county's total annual labor input is about 11.8 million. Compared with before the Great Leap Forward, the proportion of women's labor in this labor force has greatly increased, and physical strength and farming experience are weaker than before, but due to the development of the technical revolution movement, people have mastered more new technologies than before.
    The county has a total of 330,000 mu of cultivated land, and it takes about 20 labor days to cultivate one mu of land well each year, totaling 6.6 million labor days; plus the labor days for more than 30,000 mu of expanded land (reclamation, small plots) (about 12 per mu), the total annual labor days required are about 7 million.
    The county's land is scattered, the water level is high, and the water conservancy conditions are poor; it is necessary to maintain a considerable proportion of capital construction teams to ensure the needs of agricultural and other production to develop at high speed year by year. The labor days used for capital construction each year are generally around 2 million.
    The county has relatively rich mountain resources and underground mineral deposits, and a certain proportion of the labor force must be engaged in industrial, animal husbandry, sideline, forestry, and short-distance transportation production every year.
    On the basis of exploring the laws and taking stock, Licheng County comprehensively arranged labor according to the general policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the entire national economy, and prioritizing production, agriculture, and grain, and determined the proportion of labor used in various production and construction undertakings. Ensure that agricultural production (field labor) occupies 65% of the county's total labor force; the three seasons of spring plowing and sowing, the "three summers," and the "three autumns" account for 70%-75%.
    Concentrating Forces, Fighting Annihilation Wars
    According to the laws of various production and construction undertakings, Licheng County widely adopted the method of combining professional teams and mass movements, combining perennial production and seasonal production, and combining long-term preparation and short-term assaults in labor use, concentrating superior forces and fighting annihilation wars.
    All production and construction undertakings in the county, except for agricultural production, have fixed a certain proportion of professional teams according to the laws of production and the characteristics of labor use. Each professional team is equipped with a strong technical force. The professional teams must not only adhere to daily production but also prepare for large-scale mass movements. The labor force of the professional teams is generally not easily mobilized, only compressed and adjusted as necessary during the seasons when labor use is most tense.
    The county organizes four major campaigns every year: in December, January, and February, concentrate forces to carry out large-scale capital construction, and at the same time, intersperse several manure accumulation movements; April is the assault month for spring plowing and sowing; June and July are for assaulting summer harvesting, replanting, and autumn seedling management; October and November are for assaulting autumn harvesting, wheat sowing, and autumn plowing. March, May, August, and September are the crossover periods for various productions, organizing small-scale mobile warfare such as forestry, sideline occupations, short-distance transportation, and manure accumulation and transportation. When organizing major campaigns, tighten up labor in all aspects and go all out, and at the same time organize support from all parties, including workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants. Small-scale mobile warfare during the crossover period is interspersed with each other, flexible and mobile.
    When carrying out large-scale mass movements and organizing short-term assaults, Licheng County also paid attention to fighting prepared battles and annihilation wars. In terms of preparation, in addition to the usual preparation of professional teams, comprehensive preparation of the whole people is organized in the spirit of "doing sunny day work on rainy days and doing busy work in slack times." Before the beginning of each spring, about 70% of the annual manure accumulation task must be completed; before the start of each campaign, tools, equipment, fuel, and grain must be prepared. In terms of work arrangement, small campaigns are nested in major campaigns to fight annihilation wars. For example, in agricultural production: the "three summers" campaign in June and July is divided into three stages: summer harvesting, hoeing seedlings, and applying top dressing. Capital construction, in addition to larger projects, general projects are arranged in phases, completing one batch and then doing another batch, so that each campaign has a prominent center and quick victory. In terms of labor arrangement, leave some room for maneuver and set the target a little lower. In this way, the force is concentrated, the results are fast, the steel can be used on the cutting edge, and it is also more proactive.
    Trying Every Means to Tap Potential
    Another aspect of Licheng County's arrangement and use of labor is to use the laws of various production and construction undertakings to try every means to tap labor potential.
    1. Adjust the crop planting time, combining early, middle, and late sowing crops to avoid excessive concentration of labor use. In the past, wheat harvesting and millet thinning often crowded together; either wheat harvesting was delayed, or millet seedlings were neglected. This year, the county planted more than 70,000 mu of millet, of which 60,000 mu of early millet were sown ten days to half a month earlier, and more than 10,000 mu of late millet were sown five to seven days later; in this way, before the wheat harvest, the early millet had been thinned, and the late millet began to be thinned after the wheat harvest, and both farming activities had sufficient labor. In the planting of other crops, attention was also paid to rational arrangement. Before the summer harvest this year, the thinning of seedlings and the hoeing of seedlings of potatoes, corn, and cotton had been basically completed, and 60,000 mu had been top-dressed; during the wheat harvest season, we went all out and launched a campaign to rush to harvest wheat, and completed the harvesting of 130,000 mu of wheat in seven days.
    2. According to the amount of labor, arrange the crop planting ratio and adjust the unbalanced phenomenon of labor between regions. In the mountainous area of ​​Yuanzhuang and other five communes, there is little land and a lot of labor, so they plant more cash crops, Jin Queen corn, and other crops that require more labor, and appropriately expand the replanting area. The seven communes such as Dongyangguan have more land and less labor, so they appropriately expand the planting area of ​​straight wheat and increase labor-saving and high-yield crops.
    3. Advance management and catch up with everything, and do farm work in the most labor-saving period. For example, thinning millet seedlings before they grow to one and a half inches high, one worker can thin 0.7 to 1 mu, if they grow to half a foot high and then thin, it will take more than twice the labor, and it will affect the yield.
    4. Vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, reform cultivation methods, reform tools, and demand labor from the technical revolution.
    5. From top to bottom, the county attaches importance to grasping life, running public canteens well, and running nurseries and kindergartens well, so that there is work and rest, and labor is cherished. Therefore, in the past few years, although the county's labor force has decreased year by year due to supporting industrial construction, the actual number of labor days has increased year by year. It increased by 29.6% in 1958 compared with 1957, and 18.4% in 1959 compared with 1958. It is expected that it will increase by more than 10% this year compared with last year.
    Preventing Disasters, Two Sets of Arrangements
    In the labor arrangements for each year, general disasters have been predicted. What if a major disaster occurs? Licheng County has made a second set of labor force arrangements for preventing major disasters.
    The disasters that occur more frequently in Licheng County and are most harmful to crops are: the spring drought in April prevents sowing, the hail in June damages wheat and autumn seedlings, the "bottleneck" drought in July prevents crops from heading, and the wind disaster blows down corn.
    According to the law of disaster occurrence, the following countermeasures are adopted in labor arrangement:
    1. When arranging the labor force for various production and construction, leave some room for maneuver and do not set the target too rigidly, so as to strive for the initiative when a disaster occurs.
    2. All tasks in April, June, and July are prepared for disasters, and a part of the mobile labor force is arranged so that forces can be organized in time to put out the fire once a disaster occurs.
    3. Treat no disaster as a disaster year and prepare for the worst everywhere. For example, during the spring drought period in April, the labor force occupied by capital construction cannot be fully transferred. When arranging engineering projects every year, the projects in April should be arranged more flexibly. As soon as the spring drought appears, the capital construction labor force can be immediately withdrawn and invested in the drought resistance struggle.
    4. Compete with natural disasters for time and do farm work ahead of the disaster. In the past, the maturity period of wheat was the hail disaster period, and the loss was great; later, the sowing and harvesting time of wheat were advanced by ten days, and the loss was small.
    Due to adhering to the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, constantly understanding and mastering objective laws, and mastering the initiative in labor use, Licheng County has achieved bumper harvests in agricultural production year after year in the two and a half years since the continuous leap forward, and other production and construction undertakings have also achieved a comprehensive leap forward.

    总布局　巧用兵　争主动
    ——黎城县安排使用劳动力的经验
    郝占敖　毕治民
    山西黎城县认真摸索研究与掌握工农业生产和基本建设的规律，根据整个国民经济以农业为基础的方针，以生产为主、农业为主、粮食为主，合理安排劳动力，机动灵活巧用兵，从而掌握了使用劳动力的主动权，各项工作主动，农业生产连年获得丰收，工业、畜牧、副业、多种经营、短途运输、基本建设等各项生产建设事业也按比例高速度地发展起来。
    摸索规律　掌握主动
    1958年大跃进以后，黎城县农、林、牧、副、渔、工业、短途运输和基本建设，各项生产建设事业全面跃进；不到两年时间，全县的工农业总产值增长50％以上。生产建设的高速度发展，劳动力愈来愈显得不足。如何合理地安排和使用劳动力，就成为保证各项生产建设事业高速度按比例全面跃进的关键。
    如何全面合理地安排和使用劳动力呢？研究和摸索各项生产建设事业的规律，掌握运用这些规律，才能充分发挥人的主观能动性，掌握使用劳动力的主动权。因之，黎城县的领导干部和群众，对全县各项生产建设事业的规律，进行了认真的摸索与研究。
    第一、农业生产：①是整个国民经济的基础，农业生产（特别是粮食生产）搞不好，一波百动，整个生产建设事业就不可能大踏步前进。②季节性很强，贻误农时就要影响产量。特别是春耕下种，三夏、三秋时期，贻误几天时间都会受到自然界的惩罚。③受自然灾害的影响很大，特别是4月份的春旱、6月份的雹灾、7月份的卡脖旱和风灾，对农作物危害最大。在劳力使用上不稳定，风调雨顺时用劳力较少，遭灾时用劳力较多。④主要农作物的生长期大致相同，农活很集中，时间性强，机动性小；在劳力使用上很不平衡，春耕下种，三夏、三秋，三个季节用工数约占全年农业用工总数的70％—75％。⑤生产周期长，表面看来间歇性很大，实际上生产的各个环节一环扣一环，一环抓不紧，产量就要受到影响。⑥一年庄稼两年，生产准备时间长，事事要为下一步做好准备。一年有了亏空，接连几年都赶不上，在劳力使用上，必须常年保持相当比例的专业队伍。⑦和其它生产（工业、畜牧、基本建设等）联系紧密，农业生产的丰收，并不仅仅决定于农业生产本身。安排劳力时，不仅要看到农业生产，还必须兼顾到其它生产。
    第二、公社工业：和农业生产联系紧密，生产一般稳定，使用劳力比较稳定；但也可以机动，劳力多时大搞，劳力少时小搞。
    第三、畜牧业：生产比较稳定，劳力固定，机动性不大；但可以兼做一部分农活。
    第四、林业：季节性很强，主要靠短期突击。劳力使用非常集中，清明前后的春季造林和秋收前后的林业收获季节，用工数约占全年林业用工总数的80％—85％。
    第五、副业：除常年性的作坊和短途运输专业队外，主要靠春前秋后农闲季节突击，和穿插农业生产空隙进行。劳力使用上机动性大，便于组织突击。
    第六、基本建设：主要为农业生产的进一步发展创造条件，集中在春前秋后进行，第一和第四季度的用工数约占全年基本建设用工总数的70％—75％。
    摸清家底　全面安排
    在摸各项生产建设事业规律的同时，黎城县对全县的劳动力状况和历年来使用劳动力的规律，也进行了调查研究。
    全县共有男女全半劳力三万六千二百多人，其中男全劳力一万五千五百人，女全劳力九千八百九十八人，男半劳力五千五百四十三人，女半劳力五千三百四十二人。每个劳力每年做劳动日数：男全劳力三百五十个，女全劳力二百七十个，男半劳力三百个，女半劳力二百个，共计一千零八十三万多个。另外，全县还有八千二百七十二个辅助劳力，一年约可做劳动日一百余万个。总计，全县全年投工总数约为一千一百八十多万个。这支劳动大军，和大跃进以前比较，妇女劳力的比重大大增加了，体力和耕作经验较前为弱，但是由于技术革命运动的开展，人们掌握新技术却较前为多。
    全县共有耕地三十三万亩，种好一亩地每年约需工二十个，共需工六百六十万个；加上三万余亩扩种地（开荒、小块地）的用工数（每亩地十二个左右），全年需工总数约为七百万个。
    全县土地分散，水位较高，水利条件较差；必须保持相当比例的基本建设队伍，才能保证农业和其它生产逐年高速度发展的需要。每年用于基本建设的劳动日，一般在二百万个左右。
    全县有较丰富的山区资源和地下矿藏，每年必须有一定比例的劳动力从事工业、畜牧业、副业、林业和短途运输等生产。
    在摸规律和摸家底的基础上，黎城县根据整个国民经济以农业为基础的方针，以生产为主、农业为主、粮食为主，全面地进行了劳力安排，确定了各项生产建设事业使用劳力的比例。保证农业生产（田间劳动）占用全县劳力总数的65％；春耕下种、三夏、三秋三个节令，占到70％—75％。
    集中兵力　打歼灭战
    根据各项生产和建设事业的规律，黎城县在劳力使用上，广泛采用了专业队伍和群众运动相结合，常年生产和季节性生产相结合，长期准备和短期突击相结合的办法，集中优势兵力，大打歼灭战。
    全县各项生产和建设事业，除农业生产以外，根据生产规律和使用劳力的特点，都分别固定有一定比例的专业队伍。每支专业队伍都配备有较强的技术力量，专业队伍既要坚持日常生产，又要为大搞群众运动做好准备工作。专业队伍的劳动力，一般情况下不轻易调动，只是在使用劳力最紧张的季节内，进行必要的压缩和调剂。
    全县每年组织四次大战役：12月、1月、2月集中力量大搞基本建设，同时，穿插几次积肥运动；4月份为春耕下种突击月；6月、7月突击夏收、复播、秋苗管理；10月、11月突击秋收、种麦、秋耕。3月、5月、8月、9月为各种生产的交叉时期，组织林业，副业、短途运输、积运肥料等小型运动战。组织大战役时，紧缩各方面的劳力，全力以赴，同时组织工农兵学商多方支援。交叉时期的小型运动战，则互相穿插，机动灵活。
    在大搞群众运动，组织短期突击时，黎城县还注意了打有准备仗，打歼灭战。在准备工作方面，除专业队伍的平时准备外，还本着“雨天做的晴天活，闲时做的忙时活”的精神，组织全民全面性的准备。每年开春以前，都要完成全年积肥任务的70％左右；每次战役开始前，都要把工具、器材、燃料和粮食准备停当。在工作安排方面，大战役中套小战役，打歼灭战。如农业生产：6、7月的三夏战役，就分为夏收、锄苗、施追三个阶段。基本建设除较大的工程外，一般工程分期安排，完成一批，再搞一批，做到每次战役中心突出，速战速决。在安排劳力上，留有余地，盘子打的低一点。这样做，力量集中、收效快，有钢能使在刀刃上，也比较主动。
    千方百计　挖掘潜力
    黎城县安排与运用劳动力的另一个方面，是运用各项生产建设事业的规律，千方百计想办法挖掘劳动潜力。
    一、调剂作物种植时间，早、中、晚播种作物相结合，避免劳力使用上的过分集中。过去割麦和谷子间苗，常常挤在一起；不是误了收麦，便是荒了谷苗。今年全县种植七万余亩谷子，其中六万亩早谷提前下种十天至半月，一万余亩晚谷推后五至七天下种；这样在麦收前，早谷就间完了苗，麦收后晚谷才开始间苗，两种农活都有了较充足的劳力。其它作物的种植上，也注意了合理安排，今年夏收前已基本完成了间苗和薯类、玉茭、棉花的锄苗任务，并有六万亩施了追肥；麦收季节就全力以赴，展开了抢收小麦运动，七天时间全部完成了十三万亩小麦收割任务。
    二、根据劳力多少，安排作物种植比例，调整地区间劳动力不平衡的现象。后山地区沅庄等五个公社，土地少劳力多，就多种经济作物、金皇后玉米等用工较多的作物，并适当扩大复播面积。东阳关等七个公社土地多劳力少，就适当扩大正茬小麦的播种面积，增加省工高产作物。
    三、提前管理，样样赶前，把农活做在最省工的时期。如谷苗长到一寸半高以前间苗，一个工可间七分至一亩，如果长到半尺高再间苗，就要付出多一倍以至数倍的劳力，而且会影响产量。
    四、大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，改革耕作方法，改革工具，向技术革命要劳力。
    五、全县自上而下重视了抓生活、办好公共食堂，办好托儿所和幼儿园，有劳有逸，爱惜劳动力。所以几年来由于支援工业建设，全县的劳动力虽然逐年减少，可是实做劳动日数却逐年增加。1958年比1957年增加29.6％，1959年比1958年增加18.4％，今年预计将比去年再增加10％以上。
    预防灾害　两套安排
    在各年的劳力安排中，都预计了一般灾害，如果发生大的灾害怎么办？黎城县作了预防大灾的第二套劳动力安排。
    黎城县发生较多而对农作物的危害最大的灾害，主要是：4月春旱下不了种，6月冰雹毁坏小麦和秋苗，7月份的卡脖旱庄稼出不了穗，风灾把玉茭刮倒。
    根据灾害发生的规律，在劳力安排上，采取以下对策：
    一、在安排各项生产建设的劳动力时留有余地，盘子打的不要过死，以便发生灾害时争取主动。
    二、各项工作在4、6、7月都做遭灾的准备，安排出一部分机动劳力，一旦发生灾害能及时组织力量扑灭。
    三、无灾当作有灾年，处处从坏处作准备。如4月春旱时期，基本建设占用的劳力还不能全部抽调下来，每年安排工程项目时，4月份的工程要安排的机动一些，春旱一露头，就能马上把基建劳力撤下来，投入抗旱斗争。
    四、和自然灾害抢时间，把农活赶在灾害前面。过去小麦的成熟期正是雹灾期，损失很大；以后把小麦播种和收割时间都提前十天，损失就小了。
    由于坚持贯彻执行了以农业为基础的方针，不断地认识与掌握客观规律，掌握了劳力使用上的主动权，黎城县在持续跃进以来的两年半中，农业生产连年获得了丰收，其它生产建设事业也得到了全面跃进。
