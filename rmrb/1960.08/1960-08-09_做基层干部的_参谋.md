    Be a "Consultant" for Grassroots Cadres	Wang Pu
    After enterprise leading cadres go to the production front line and discover problems within the scope of a group, a work section, or a workshop, how should they handle them? Should they help grassroots cadres with ideas, acting as their "consultant"? Or should they put the grassroots cadres aside and only focus on being the "commander" themselves?
    The two different approaches lead to completely different results. News from Lanzhou tells us that by truly helping grassroots cadres improve their work and acting as their "consultant," production is certainly good when the leading cadres are present, and production remains good even after the leading cadres leave; if one only focuses on being the "commander," the situation may be like what the workers say: "When the leading cadres come down, production goes up, when the leading cadres go up, production goes down," and production fluctuates with the ups and downs of the leading cadres.
    Leading cadres participating in labor shifts are both ordinary laborers and leaders. "Isn't solving specific problems the responsibility of the leader? Why is it okay to be a consultant for lower-level cadres, but not okay to be a commander?" Yes, leading cadres should solve specific problems themselves, and be red entrepreneurs who are both politically minded and down-to-earth. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong require leading comrades at all levels to go deep into the production front line, eat, live, work, and discuss with the workers, not only to understand the actual situation in order to make decisions that are more in line with objective reality, but also to better and more timely solve all specific problems. However, there are various problems, some that should be solved by the factory director and the Party committee secretary, and some that should be solved by the workshop director, work section chief, or group leader. For problems within the scope of responsibility of lower-level cadres, leading cadres should not only manage them, but also trace the roots and get to the bottom of them—manage them to the end. However, the so-called "manage" here has two meanings: helping subordinates find the root of the problem and think of solutions—appearing as a "consultant"; supervising and inspecting—appearing as a leader.
    Improving the leadership level of lower-level cadres is also the responsibility of leaders. In industrial and mining enterprises, there are several levels of cadres under the factory director: workshop, work section, and group, which is needed for production development. The Party's guidelines, policies, and resolutions are implemented level by level through them. The masses must also rely on them to mobilize and connect. Only by improving their ability to connect with the masses, mobilize the masses, analyze and observe problems, and solve problems, can the factory-level leadership have a solid foundation.
    The Party committee secretary, manager, and factory director are the "commanders" of factories and enterprises, which is undoubtedly true. But only by being good at being a consultant to subordinates can the "commander" implement his intentions and be a good "commander."

### 做基层干部的“参谋”

    做基层干部的“参谋”	王朴
    企业领导干部到生产第一线以后，发现属于一个小组、一个工段或者一个车间范围内的问题，怎么处理？是帮助基层干部出主意，当他们的“参谋”呢？还是把基层干部放在一边，只顾自己当“司令员”？
    两种做法不同，结果迥异。兰州市的消息告诉我们，切切实实地帮助基层干部改进工作，做好基层干部的“参谋”，领导干部在场时生产固然很好，就是领导干部离开以后，生产仍然很好；只顾自己当“司令员”，情况就有可能像工人所说的：“领导干部下来，生产上去，领导干部上去，生产下来”，生产随着领导干部的一上一下而波动。
    领导干部跟班劳动，既是普通劳动者，又是领导者。“解决具体问题，难道不是领导者的责任吗？为什么当下级干部的参谋使得，而当司令员就使不得？”是的，领导干部应当自己动手解决一个一个的具体问题，要做一个既有政治头脑又踏踏实实的红色事业家。党中央和毛泽东同志要求各级领导同志深入生产第一线，和工人同吃同住同劳动同商量，不仅仅是为了了解实际，以便作出更能符合客观实际的决策，也正是为了更好更及时地解决一切具体问题。可是，有各种各样的问题，有应由厂长、党委书记负责解决的，有应由车间主任、工段长或小组长负责解决的。对于下级干部责任范围内的问题，领导干部不仅应该管，而且要牵藤摘瓜、寻根究底——管到底。但是，这里所谓“管”，有两重意思：帮助下级找出问题的根源，想解决的办法——以“参谋”的姿态出现；督促和检查——以领导的姿态出现。
    提高下级干部的领导水平，也是领导者的责任。在工矿企业里，在厂长之下有车间、工段、小组几级干部，这是生产发展所需要的。党的方针、政策、决议，是依靠他们一级一级贯彻下去的。群众也要依靠他们去发动，去联系。只有提高他们联系群众、发动群众、分析和观察问题、解决问题的本领，厂一级的领导工作才有靠山。
    党委书记、经理、厂长，是工厂、企业的“司令员”，这是毫无疑问的。但是只有善于做好下级的参谋，“司令员”才能贯彻自己的意图，也才能当好“司令员”。
