    Emptying Ashes · Delivering Fertilizer

    In order to strive for greater grain production in the autumn, the members of the Liu Hui Production Team of the Gucheng Commune in Jiaohe County, Hebei Province, advocated applying fertilizer to the summer corn one more time. Team Leader Liu Shixiu discussed it with the members to find fertilizer sources from all aspects. Shixiu said, "The plant ash in the public canteen hasn't been cleaned out for a long time. This is a good batch of fertilizer." Team member Liu Jinrong said, "Cleaning plant ash is the responsibility of the canteen. In my opinion, the firewood ash and soot from everyone's stoves and kang (heated brick bed) holes are all top-quality fertilizers, and they should also be cleaned up." Everyone agreed with this opinion, and each production group started to take action, with each household averaging six or seven jin of soot from their kang holes. Added to the plant ash from the canteen, it was enough for another application of fertilizer. The next day, the members carried and pushed the fertilizer to the fields, and each mu of summer corn was given another application of fertilizer.

    掏灰·送肥
    河北交河县古城公社刘灰生产队的社员，为了争取秋季增产更多的粮食，主张给夏玉米再施一次追肥。小队长刘世秀就和社员一起讨论，从各方面找肥源。世秀说：“公共食堂里的草木灰，好长时间没有清理了，这是一批好肥料。”社员刘金荣说：“清理草木灰，由食堂负责。我看每家的锅灶、炕洞里的柴灰、烟子都是上等肥料，也应该清理一下。”大家都同意这个意见，各生产小组都动起手来，每户平均清理出了六、七斤炕洞里的烟子。加上食堂里的草木灰，足够再施一次追肥了。第二天，社员们挑的挑、推的推，把肥料送到了地里，每亩夏玉米又追施了一次肥料。
