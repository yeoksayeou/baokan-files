    Good Teaching Material for Grassroots Cadres

    The matter of cadres of the Shangmajia Production Team of the Sanjiaji People's Commune in Hezhen County leading vegetable planting is a beneficial inspiration for comrades engaged in grassroots work in rural areas. It vividly illustrates the excellent work style and leadership methods required for grassroots work.

    First, the Party Branch Secretary of Shangmajia Production Team, Ma Youcai, and the Captain, Deng Lianxin, truly achieved leading production by participating in production. Regarding the work of leading the masses in planting vegetables, they did not just make general appeals, nor did they bury themselves in labor alone. Instead, they participated in labor, took the lead in overcoming difficulties, and planted vegetables on barren land, opening up a path for the entire production team to plant autumn vegetables and leading the masses forward. Grassroots cadres participating in labor in this way also realize their leadership.

    Second, in leading a production team to plant vegetables, they not only created a vigorous mass movement but also worked solidly and meticulously to solve the various practical problems that arose in the mass movement.

    Third, as the work progressed smoothly, the leadership work also deepened step by step. Everyone in this team is now planting vegetables, and the area planted has more than doubled. Is that the end of the matter? Is there anything to be satisfied with? No, the cadres of the Shangmajia Production Team immediately followed up by vigorously grasping the field management of vegetables, striving for high yields and abundant harvests.

    From planting to managing vegetables, the leadership work is tightly linked at every stage and deepens step by step. It can truly be said that it is comprehensive, detailed, practical, and profound.

    基层干部的好教材
    和政县三甲集人民公社上马家生产队干部领导种菜的事，对农村搞基层工作的同志是一个有益的启示。它生动地说明了作基层工作所需要具备的优良的工作作风和领导方法。
    第一，上马家生产队的党支部书记马有才、队长邓连信，真正作到了通过参加生产领导生产。对于领导群众种菜的工作，他们既不是只作一般的号召，也不是只顾自己埋头劳动，而是通过参加劳动，带头突破困难，在瘠薄的土地上种上了菜，为全生产队打开一条大种秋菜的路子，带领群众前进。基层干部这样来参加劳动，也就实现了自己的领导。
    第二，他们领导一个生产队种菜，既造成了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，又作到扎扎实实、深入细致地解决群众运动中出现的各种实际问题。
    第三，随着工作的顺利开展，领导工作也步步深入。这个队已经是人人动手种菜，种菜的面积猛增了一倍。事情是不是就完了呢？是不是就可以满足了呢？不，上马家生产队的干部又紧跟上去，大抓蔬菜的田间管理，力争高产多收。
    蔬菜从种到管，领导工作环环扣紧，步步深入，真可以说是抓得全面，抓得细，抓得实，抓得深。
