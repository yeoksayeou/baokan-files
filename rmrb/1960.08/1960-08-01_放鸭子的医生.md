    The Duck-Herding Doctor Lin Mao
    In Shanding Village on Nan'ao Island, there is a health station. How did this health station come to be? Here's a story about a "duck-herding doctor."
    In May of last year, Lin Shengxiong, a soldier and member of the Communist Youth League from a certain unit, came to Shanding Village to raise ducks for the army. Every day he drove the ducks to the stream next to the village, and often saw villagers going to the hospital seven miles away for treatment. This was the busy farming season, and it was also the hottest time of the year. This not only delayed production, but the patients suffered from walking under the scorching sun! How wonderful it would be if there were a health station in the village! A noble love for the people burned in Lin Shengxiong's heart. He thought, before joining the army, he had studied medicine and worked as a medic. He could treat common illnesses. If he could treat the villagers while herding ducks, wouldn't that be great? So he decided to set up a health station to serve the villagers. The instructor gave him enthusiastic support. Lin Shengxiong started working on it. He used thirty yuan of his savings to buy some commonly used medical supplies, and during the time he had free from herding ducks during the day and at night, he voluntarily went door-to-door to treat the masses.
    More than ten days passed. Under Lin Shengxiong's careful treatment, Zhang Cai's wife's boils on her face were healed, and Huang Yi's child's stomach problems were also cured. From then on, the name of the "duck-herding volunteer doctor" spread. When the commune brigade party committee learned about this, it immediately allocated seventy yuan, vacated a room, selected a female health worker, and established the "Army-Civilian Friendship Health Station."
    After the health station was officially established, Lin Shengxiong diligently studied medical books and consulted doctors to improve his skills, and treated the villagers even more enthusiastically. He often went to rescue seriously ill patients late at night, and often opened the door for diagnosis before dawn. This spirit of enthusiastically serving the patients deeply moved the broad masses of villagers.
    The villagers loved the health station and respected Lin Shengxiong. When he was busy treating patients and had no time to take care of the ducks, the villagers competed to help him herd the ducks. When the villagers saw that he had lost weight, they sent him eggs, fresh fish, and dried shrimp; when he was sick, the villagers took care of him enthusiastically. From January of this year, the commune has sent forty-two young people in three groups to learn hygiene knowledge from him. Now the Shanding Village Health Station has been converted into a general station, and thirteen branch stations have been established in nearby villages. The seeds sown by Lin Shengxiong have already borne fruitful results in the Shanding Village area.

    放鸭子的医生	林茂
    在南澳岛的山顶村里，有一所保健站。这个保健站是怎样办起来的？这里有一段关于“放鸭子医生”的故事。
    去年5月，某部战士、共青团员林胜雄到山顶村放养部队的鸭子。他每天把鸭子赶到村旁小溪，不时看到一些老乡到七里路远的医院看病。这时正是农忙季节，又是大暑天。这样，固然耽误了生产，病人冒着烈日行走，也好不难受！要是村里有个保健站该多好呵！热爱人民的崇高感情，燃烧着林胜雄的心，他想入伍前，他学过医，又当过卫生员，一般小病还能够治，如果一边放鸭子，一边给社员治病，这不是很好么？于是他打定主意，要建立起一个保健站，为社员们服务。教导员给予热情的支持。林胜雄就这样着手干起来了。他用自己积蓄下来的三十元钱，买了一些常用的医疗用品，在白天放鸭的空隙时间和晚上，主动地上门为群众治病。
    十多天过去了。在林胜雄的细心治疗之下，山顶村里张才的妻子脸上长的毒疮平服了，黄宜小孩的肠胃病也好了。从此，“放鸭子的义务医生”的名字传开了。公社大队党委知道这件事，马上拨出七十元钱，腾出一间房子，选出女保健员，成立了“军民友谊保健站”。
    保健站正式成立后，林胜雄一面认真学习医学书籍，一面向医生请教，提高自己的水平，更加热情地为社员治病。他常常深夜去抢救重病人，常常天没亮就开门接诊，这种热情为病人服务的精神，使广大社员深深受到感动。
    社员们热爱保健站，也敬重林胜雄。他忙着诊治病人，无暇看管鸭子时，社员便争着帮他放鸭子。乡亲们看见他瘦了，给他送来鸡蛋、鲜鱼、虾米；他病了，社员热情地照顾他。今年1月至今，公社又派了四十二名青年分三批向他学习卫生常识。如今山顶村保健站已经改为总站，在附近村子设立了十三个分站。林胜雄所撒下的种子，已经在山顶村一带结出丰硕的果实来了。
