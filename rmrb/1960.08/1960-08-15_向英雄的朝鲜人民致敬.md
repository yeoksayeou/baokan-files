    Saluting the Heroic Korean People
    Li Dequan, President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association

    The 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea has arrived. The Chinese people, with extreme excitement, welcome this great festival of the Korean people as if it were their own.

    Fifteen years ago, on August 15th, thanks to the assistance of the heroic Soviet army, the Korean people were liberated from the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism, thus beginning a new era in Korean history.

    For fifteen years, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people have carried out earth-shaking revolutionary changes, waged a heroic and moving just war to defend their motherland, and carried out high-speed socialist construction, thereby changing the past poverty and backwardness of their country and writing an extremely glorious page in Korean history. Now, a prosperous and strong new Korea stands firmly in the East of the socialist camp, defending peace in Asia and the world.

    In the three-year-long just war to defend their motherland, the Korean people, with their unwavering revolutionary will and indomitable fighting spirit, heroically resisted the aggression of US imperialism, and with the support of the people of the world, especially the people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, achieved a great victory. This victory defended Korea's independence and our country's security, disrupted the entire plan of US imperialism's war of aggression, and defended world peace. At the same time, it revealed to the people of the world the truth that US imperialism, though seemingly powerful, is ultimately just a paper tiger. The victory of Korea's war to defend its motherland and the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement once again demonstrated to the people of the world that only by resolutely resisting US imperialism's aggression and waging an unyielding struggle against US imperialism can its policies of war and aggression be crushed, and can it be forced to sit down and negotiate with peace-loving countries to reach certain agreements beneficial to peace.

    The victorious Korean people, after the armistice, did not stop for a single day, immediately using the same hands that eliminated the enemy yesterday to engage in a bustling economic recovery and socialist construction. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung, and the Korean people's selfless labor enthusiasm and creativity, Korea's socialist construction is advancing at a rapid pace like a Chollima, achieving brilliant achievements in all aspects.

    In industry, the total industrial output value of the first five-year plan has been completed two and a half years ahead of schedule. In 1959, the total industrial output value increased by 5.6 times compared to 1944. Now, Korea is not only able to build large-scale hydropower stations and large steel plants on its own, but also able to produce trucks, tractors, and various other mechanical equipment.

    In agriculture, socialist collectivization has been fully realized, water conservancy has been basically completed, and it is striving to achieve agricultural mechanization.

    Cultural and educational undertakings have also made great progress. In November 1958, Korea implemented a system of compulsory secondary education.

    Imperialism once used artillery fire to turn countless towns and villages in Korea into ruins. They dreamed that the Korean people would suffer from hunger and hardship for a long time. However, contrary to the shameful wishes of imperialism, only a few years have passed, and brand-new cities and towns, magnificent factories and schools, wide and neat streets, and comfortable residences have reappeared, and the people's lives are happier and better than before the war.

    The brilliant achievements of socialist construction in Korea once again prove that under the leadership of the correct line of the working-class party, giving full play to the revolutionary initiative and creativity of the masses can create unprecedented miracles. The Chinese people are infinitely excited by these great achievements of the Korean people, and have drawn many useful experiences and inspiring strength from them.

    While building their own country, the Korean people resolutely safeguard the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, resolutely oppose the policies of aggression and war of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, and resolutely support the national democratic movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Korean people's contribution to the cause of world peace and human progress has won the respect of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

    Since the Korean armistice, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people have consistently abided by the armistice agreement and have made unremitting efforts to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea. In contrast, US imperialism has consistently and wantonly violated the armistice agreement. The US aggressor troops are clinging to South Korea and constantly transporting new weapons, including atomic weapons, in large quantities into South Korea, stepping up the planning of new wars of aggression. Under the criminal rule of US imperialism and its running dogs, South Korea has become a living hell. In stark contrast, the great achievements of socialist construction and the happy life of the people in the northern half of Korea are increasingly promoting the awakening of the people in the southern half of Korea and are increasingly strongly attracting the hearts of the people in the southern half of Korea. The people of South Korea have increasingly realized that the occupation by US imperialism is the root cause of all their disasters. They resolutely demand the expulsion of the US aggressor troops, the overthrow of the South Korean traitorous puppet regime, and the realization of the peaceful reunification of their motherland. Since the beginning of this year, the people of South Korea have launched a massive revolutionary struggle and have achieved significant victories. US imperialism and its puppet regime will never be able to extinguish the flames of this struggle.

    The Chinese people fully support Korea's cause of peaceful reunification and firmly believe that, with the resolute struggle of the entire Korean people and with the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving countries and people around the world, the US aggressor troops will eventually be driven out, and the just cause of the Korean people to peacefully reunify their motherland will surely be victorious.

    China and Korea are as closely related as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. In the struggles for national democratic revolution and the construction and defense of socialism, the Chinese and Korean people have shared the same destiny, breathed the same air, and supported each other with blood and lives. In every period of the Chinese people's revolution, tens of thousands of Korean revolutionary volunteers, together with the Chinese people, carried out selfless and heroic struggles for the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, and many of them sacrificed their precious lives. The victory of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from the long-term, self-sacrificing assistance given by the fraternal Korean people. The heroic war waged by the Korean people to resist US aggression not only defended the independence of their motherland, but also defended the security of our country and the entire socialist camp. During the period when the Chinese People's Volunteers were in Korea, the Korean elders, brothers, and sisters gave them care and attention as close as flesh and blood.

    In our country's socialist construction, the Korean people have also provided significant support in various aspects of economy and culture. The Korean people's lofty spirit of internationalism and close fraternal friendship with the Chinese people is as high as the mountains and as deep as the sea, beyond the power of words to express. Currently, Sino-Korean Friendship Week is being held in various parts of our country to warmly celebrate the extraordinary festival of the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea. It is certain that through the activities of Sino-Korean Friendship Week, the friendship forged with blood between our two peoples will be further deepened and developed.

    I wish the Korean people new and greater achievements in their socialist construction, and the early realization of the just cause of the Korean people's peaceful reunification of their motherland.

        Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!

    向英雄的朝鲜人民致敬
    中国朝鲜友好协会会长  李德全
    朝鲜解放十五周年的日子来到了。中国人民以极其兴奋的心情，像迎接自己的节日一样来迎接这一朝鲜人民的伟大节日。
    十五年前的8月15日，由于英雄的苏联军队的援助朝鲜人民从日本帝国主义的殖民统治下获得了解放，从而开始了朝鲜历史的新纪元。
    十五年来，朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的领导下，进行了翻天复地的革命变革，进行了可歌可泣的保卫祖国的正义战争，进行了高速度的社会主义建设，从而改变了自己祖国过去的贫困落后的面貌，在朝鲜的历史上写下了极其光荣的一页。现在，一个繁荣富强的新朝鲜坚强地屹立在社会主义阵营的东方，保卫着亚洲和世界的和平。
    在历时三年的保卫祖国的正义战争中，朝鲜人民以无比坚定的革命意志和无比顽强的战斗精神，英勇地抗击了美帝国主义的侵略，在世界人民、特别是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民的支持下，取得了伟大的胜利。这一胜利，保卫了朝鲜的独立和我国的安全，打乱了美帝国主义整个侵略战争的计划，捍卫了世界和平，同时在全世界人民面前揭示了美帝国主义貌似强大而归根结底不过是一只纸老虎的真理。朝鲜保卫祖国战争的胜利，和朝鲜停战协定的签订，再一次向全世界人民说明，只有坚决抗击美帝国主义的侵略，对美帝国主义进行不屈不挠的斗争，才能粉碎美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，才能迫使它坐下来同爱好和平的国家进行谈判，达成有利于和平的某些协议。
    胜利了的朝鲜人民，在停战之后，一天也没有停歇，立即用昨天消灭敌人的双手，从事热火朝天的经济恢复工作和社会主义建设。由于朝鲜劳动党和金日成同志的正确领导、朝鲜人民的忘我劳动热情和创造精神，朝鲜的社会主义建设事业以千里马的快速步伐向前飞驰，在各方面取得了辉煌的成就。
    在工业方面已经提前两年半完成第一个五年计划的工业总产值，1959年工业总产值比1944年增长了五点六倍。现在朝鲜不仅能够自力建设大水力发电站和大炼铁厂，而且能够生产载重汽车、拖拉机和其他各种机械设备。
    在农业方面已完全实现了社会主义合作化，基本上完成了水利化，正在为实现农业机械化而斗争。
    文化教育事业也有了巨大的发展，1958年11月，朝鲜已实行了中等义务教育制。
    帝国主义曾经用炮火把朝鲜的无数城镇村庄炸成废墟，他们梦想朝鲜人民将长期遭受饥饿和苦难，然而与帝国主义的可耻愿望相反，时间才过去几年，崭新的城市和村镇、宏伟的工厂和学校、宽阔整齐的街道、舒适的住宅又重新出现，人民的生活比战前更幸福更美好了。
    朝鲜社会主义建设的辉煌成就，再次证明了在工人阶级政党的正确路线的领导下，充分发挥人民群众的革命积极性和创造性，就能创造出史无前例的奇迹。中国人民为朝鲜人民所取得的这些伟大成就而感到无限兴奋，并且从中吸取了许多有益的经验和鼓舞的力量。
    朝鲜人民在建设自己祖国的同时，坚决维护以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义集团的侵略政策和战争政策，坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的民族民主运动，朝鲜人民对于世界和平和人类进步事业所作的贡献，赢得了中国人民和全世界人民的崇敬。
    自从朝鲜停战以来，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民一贯遵守停战协定，并且为实现朝鲜的和平统一进行了不懈的努力。与此相反，美帝国主义却一直肆意破坏停战协定，美国侵略军死赖在南朝鲜不走，而且不断把包括原子武器在内的新式武器大量运进南朝鲜，加紧策划新的侵略战争。在美帝国主义及其走狗的罪恶统治下的南朝鲜，已经变成人间地狱。在鲜明的对比下，朝鲜北半部社会主义建设的伟大成就和人民的幸福生活，越来越有力地促进朝鲜南半部人民的觉醒，越来越强烈地吸引着朝鲜南半部人民的心。南朝鲜人民已经日益认清美帝国主义的占领是他们一切灾难的根源，他们坚决要求赶走美国侵略军，推翻南朝鲜的卖国傀儡政权，实现祖国的和平统一。今年以来，南朝鲜人民展开了声势浩大的革命斗争，并取得了重大的胜利，美帝国主义及其傀儡政权休想扑灭这个斗争的火焰。
    中国人民全力支持朝鲜的和平统一事业，并且坚信，在全体朝鲜人民的坚决斗争下，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，美国侵略军终将被赶走，朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的正义事业一定要胜利。
    中朝两国唇齿相依，休戚与共。中国人民和朝鲜人民在彼此的民族民主革命和建设与保卫社会主义事业的斗争中，曾经同命运，共呼吸，并且用鲜血和生命相互支援。在中国人民革命的每一个时期，都有成千上万的朝鲜革命志士和中国人民一起，为中国人民的解放事业进行了忘我的英勇斗争，其中许多人并且献出了他们宝贵的生命。中国革命的胜利是同兄弟的朝鲜人民所给予的长期的、自我牺牲的援助分不开的。朝鲜人民所进行的英勇的抗击美国侵略的战争，不仅保卫了自己祖国的独立，而且保卫了我国和整个社会主义阵营的安全。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜期间，朝鲜的父老兄弟姊妹给予了情同骨肉的关怀和照顾。
    在我国的社会主义建设事业中，朝鲜人民也在经济文化各方面给予了重大的支援。朝鲜人民对中国人民的这种崇高的国际主义精神和亲密的兄弟情谊，真是山高海深，非语言所能表达。目前，我国各地正在举行中朝友好周，热烈庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年这一不平凡的节日。可以肯定，通过中朝友好周的活动，我们两国人民用鲜血凝成的友谊将会进一步加深和发展。
    祝朝鲜人民在自己的社会主义建设事业中取得新的更伟大的成就，朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的正义事业早日实现。
        中朝两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
