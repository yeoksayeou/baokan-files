Brotherly Countries' Construction

    A Grand Project on the Banks of the Neisse River

    On the banks of the Neisse River, a border river in southwestern Poland, a new and important industrial base is rising. The main project of this industrial base is a giant mining and power complex called Turów. It is one of the largest construction projects in Poland's Six-Year Plan.

    Giant Open-Pit Coal Mines

    In the area a dozen kilometers south of Zgorzelec on the Neisse River, rich coal deposits are hidden. According to recent geological surveys, the lignite reserves in this area amount to one billion tons. To meet construction needs, the Polish Party and government decided to accelerate the development of the Turów mines. In October 1957, Poland and the German Democratic Republic signed an agreement stipulating cooperation between the two countries in the construction of the Turów coal mine. This includes the expansion of the Turów No. 1 open-pit coal mine and the construction of the No. 2 mine.

    Turów No. 1 coal mine was completely taken over from the German side when Poland was liberated. Thanks to expansion and renovation, the output of this coal mine has grown rapidly, exceeding six million tons in 1959. Now the coal mine is continuing to expand, and by 1965, production will reach seven million tons.

    Turów No. 2 coal mine will begin production in 1962, and by 1965, production will reach ten million tons.

    Both Turów No. 1 and No. 2 coal mines will be highly mechanized. There will be excavators capable of completing two thousand cubic meters of earthwork per hour, and conveyor belts tens of kilometers long will be used to remove the soil above the coal seam and transport the coal to the central coal preparation plant.

    The Largest Power Station in the Country

    The second part of the Turów joint center project is the construction of a giant power station. It will become the largest power station in Poland, with a power generation capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts and an annual power generation of 8.6 billion kilowatt-hours, equivalent to about one-third of Poland's total power generation in 1958.

    The Turów power station will have six 200,000-kilowatt turbine generators and six boilers, each capable of producing 650 tons of steam per hour. In order to supply the power station with the water it needs, a large reservoir with a capacity of five million cubic meters and several small reservoirs will be built on the right bank of the Neisse River's tributary.

    The first set of turbine generators at the Turów power station will be put into production between 1962 and 1963, and the remaining generators will also be put into production in the following six months.

    A Flourishing New City

    As the construction of the Turów industrial base expands, the city of Zgorzelec on the Neisse River and its surrounding areas are becoming more and more prosperous. A few years ago, the population here was only 40,000, but by the end of 1959, it exceeded 60,000. Along with the grand industrial construction, a large-scale social welfare center (including dormitories, shops, clinics, schools, kindergartens, etc.) is also under construction. Every month, many workers come here from all over the country to participate in the construction. They work enthusiastically, building Poland's new socialist industrial base with their own hands.

    尼斯河畔的宏伟工程
    在波兰西南部的边界河流——尼斯河畔，一个新的重要的工业基地正在兴起。这个工业基地的主要工程是一个巨型的采矿和动力联合中心，叫做图鲁夫。它是波兰六年计划期间最大的建设工程之一。
    巨大的露天煤矿
    在尼斯河畔兹格热莱茨城以南十几公里的地区，蕴藏着丰富的煤矿，根据最近的地质调查，这一地区的褐煤藏量有十亿吨。为了满足建设的需要，波兰党和政府决定加紧开发图鲁夫的矿藏。1957年10月，波兰同德意志民主共和国签订了一项协定，规定两国合作建设图鲁夫煤矿。这包括扩建图鲁夫一号露天煤矿和兴建二号煤矿。
    图鲁夫一号煤矿是波兰解放时从德国方面完整地接受过来的。由于进行了扩建和改建，这个煤矿产量迅速增长，1959年已超过了六百万吨。现在煤矿正在继续扩建，到1965年产量将达七百万吨。
    图鲁夫二号煤矿将在1962年开始投入生产，到1965年，产量将达一千万吨。
    图鲁夫一号和二号煤矿都将是高度机械化的。这里将拥有每小时能完成二千土方的掘土机，长达几十公里的输送带将用来移去煤层上的土并把煤运送到中央选煤厂去。
    全国最大的发电站
    图鲁夫联合中心的第二部分工程是建设一个巨型发电站。它将成为波兰全国最大的发电站，发电能力将达一百二十万瓩，每年发电量为八亿六千万度，约等于1958年波兰全国发电量的三分之一。
    图鲁夫发电站将拥有六台二十万瓩的涡轮发电机和六台锅炉，每小时可产蒸汽六百五十吨。为了使发电站得到需用的水，将在尼斯河支流的右岸兴建一个容量为五百万立方米的大水库和几个小水库。
    图鲁夫发电站的第一组涡轮发电机将在1962—1963年间投入生产，其余的发电机也将在以后的半年中投入生产。
    新兴的繁荣城市
    随着图鲁夫工业基地的建设日益扩展，尼斯河畔的兹格热莱茨城以及附近地区也越来越繁荣。几年以前，这里的人口只有四万，到1959年底便超过六万。和宏伟的工业建设同时，一个巨大规模的社会福利中心（包括宿舍、商店、卫生所、学校、幼儿园等）也在兴建。每个月都有许多职工从全国各地到这里参加建设。他们热情地劳动，用自己的双手建设着波兰的社会主义新型工业基地。（附图片）
