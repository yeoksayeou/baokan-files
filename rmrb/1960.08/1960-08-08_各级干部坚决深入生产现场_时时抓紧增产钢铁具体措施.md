Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 7th August: Workers at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company achieved another victory of high output and high quality in the first five days of August. Compared with the last five days of July, the average daily output of these five days increased by 21.4% for steel, 29.7% for steel products, and 64% for pig iron; the quality of products was generally improved.

The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company workers had already prepared for August production in July. Entering August, although the climate in Chongqing was particularly hot, the steelworkers proposed to turn the high-temperature season into a high-output and high-quality season, and devoted themselves to production with greater enthusiasm. The leaders of the company and various factories went deep into the front line of production, directing production in the face of high temperatures. The workers of the Pinglu No. 1 Plant, which had just undergone major repairs in July, used new enthusiasm and new equipment to continuously over fulfill the steel production plan in the first five days of August. From August 1st, the Pinglu No. 2 Plant had leading cadres take charge of the production of furnace front, furnace back, iron melting furnace, equipment maintenance, and supply of raw materials, grasping every link and every moment, and as a result, also achieved high output and high quality. In addition to using pig iron from the iron-smelting plant, the converter plant extensively collected and utilized scrap steel, so that the converter was well fed. The production level of converter steel in this plant has been leading among several converter plants in recent days.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th August: In the first five days of August, the output of various products of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company increased significantly compared with the same period last month. Among them, pig iron increased by 21.5%, steel increased by 4.5%, steel products increased by 175.4%, and the output of metallurgical coke and refractory materials also increased substantially.

At the beginning of August, workers in various departments of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company launched a chain competition targeting weak links in production. Transportation department workers, under the slogan of "Produce as much as you transport, transport as soon as it is produced," seized the time to transport ore. The total amount of transportation in the first three days of August was more than 5,100 tons more than the original plan, timely and adequately supplying the needs of iron and steel smelting. Iron smelting plant workers strengthened raw material roasting and furnace front operations, which significantly increased pig iron production and supplied more high-quality pig iron to the steel plant.

The company's party committee secretary, manager, and leaders of various factories moved to the production site to solve key problems in production one by one. At the same time, a group of functional department cadres were transferred to production sections and groups to eat, live, work, and discuss with the workers, specifically organizing production.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th August: The average daily output level of steel and steel products of Daye Steel Plant from August 1st to 5th increased by 8.2% and 22% respectively compared with the average daily output level in July.

In recent days, Daye Steel Plant workers have focused on converters, aiming to improve product quality and shorten smelting time, actively promoting new technologies and improving enterprise management. Workers throughout the plant have vigorously promoted a spirit of collaboration, creating favorable conditions for converter production in all aspects. The converter workshop, transportation department, and raw materials section established a joint office to strengthen the management of the stockyard, ensuring stable raw material composition and uniform feeding, which significantly reduced the sulfur content of pig iron. As a result, the qualification rate of converter steel increased by an average of 5.99% compared with July. The converter workshop workers implemented some new operating methods, which shortened the smelting time of converter steel. The rolling mill department greatly reduced non-production time by establishing a regional cycle inspection system, thereby increasing the output of steel products.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th August: The total stripping and mining output of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's Daye Iron Mine in the first five days of August increased by 44.5% compared with the same period last month, and a large amount of ore was mined to supply Wuhan Iron and Steel's iron smelting.

The workers of Daye Iron Mine have recently focused on equipment maintenance as a key task. More than 90% of the production workers in the mine participated in the self-inspection and self-repair of equipment, providing a reliable guarantee for increased ore production. The workers in the ore dressing workshop set up eleven small factories in a very short period, repaired 42 various sluice gates, 1,360 sets of complete screws, and 204 pressure rollers. Electric shovel and drilling machine workers paid attention to the maintenance of equipment, which improved the attendance rate of equipment.

The mine's leaders implemented the "one-two-three" system of holding meetings for one day, working in the office for two days, and laboring for three days, going deep into key links to cultivate "experimental fields." Party Committee Secretary Chen Mingjiang and Mining Workshop General Branch Secretary Meng Guangsen led 21 cadres to the Jianshan working area to cultivate "experimental fields," helping the cadres and workers of this working area solve key problems in production. In the first five days of August, they created a new achievement of doubling the average daily output.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 7th August: The actions of workers at Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company to turn August into a high-yield month have begun to show results. Compared with July, the average daily output level of various products of this company in the first five days of August increased by 4.3% for pig iron, 8.1% for steel, and 30.5% for steel products; the product quality has also improved.

In late July, the CPC Ma'anshan Municipal Committee held a meeting to review and summarize the experience of steel production in the previous period and proposed measures to strive for further increases in steel production. Under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and the Company Party Committee, the company's workers launched a production competition. The workers of the rolling mill proposed five major measures to achieve high output and high quality. The second workshop completed 117% of the daily plan on August 1, and the product qualification rate reached 95%.

In order to enable the blast furnace to obtain sufficient raw materials, Huang Yu, Minister of the Industry Department of the CPC Anhui Provincial Committee, and Wei Anmin, Secretary of the Ma'anshan Municipal Committee, and Ni Hengzhong, Deputy Secretary, led cadres to the three major mines of Nanshan, Gushan, and Taochong on July 30 to lead production.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 7th August: The output of steel and iron in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the first five days of August increased by 9% and 3% respectively compared with the same period in July.

The leaders of the Autonomous Region Party Committee and various departments and bureaus have recently continued to go deep into the front line of production, implementing the "two-four system" and "two-five system" leadership methods, leading the workers to focus on ore screening, roasting, and coking production, so that the blast furnace can be fed with cooked materials and fine materials. Improvements have also been made in transportation, technological transformation, and enterprise management, which has significantly improved the production of Baotou Steel's No. 1 blast furnace and steel companies in Ulanhot, Jining and other places.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 7th August: Cadres of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's August 1st Steel Plant went deep into the front line and focused on technical management, which increased the steel output in the first five days of August by 23.2% compared with the same period in July, and the qualification rate of steel remained at around 95%.

After the cadres of this plant went deep into the front line, they strengthened technical management. First, some operating procedures were formulated and revised, and technical measures such as timed, quantitative, and rapid blowing of converters and timely equipment maintenance were established, and a clear responsibility system was implemented. Second, the original record system was established and improved. Third, a strict quality supervision system was established to strictly control the block size and chemical composition of raw materials. After the workers strictly implemented these measures, they not only increased steel production but also improved the quality of steel.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 7th August: The average daily output of pig iron at Jinan Iron Plant in Shandong Province from August 1st to 5th increased by 11.2% compared with the average daily output in July.

In order to achieve production in August exceeding July, the Party Committee of this plant held two expanded meetings of the Party Committee at the beginning of the month, carefully arranging the production in August. The factory leaders went deep into the front line of production, focusing on blast furnace operation, raw material supply, technological innovation, enterprise management, safety production, and workers' lives, and implemented day and night shifts, ensuring that leaders were present at the site for each furnace and each shift to participate in production, inspect production, and direct production.

Encouraged by the leaders going deep into the production site, the workers' production enthusiasm was even higher. For example, the workers of No. 1 blast furnace overcame various difficulties and increased the air volume and air temperature, so that the production level continued to rise, and the blast furnace utilization coefficient on August 5 reached 2.12. The workers in the transportation department improved loading and unloading tools and methods, which increased the daily transportation volume of coke by about 60%.
