Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 12th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today, once again expressing firm support for the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai’s peace initiative regarding the conclusion of a non-aggression peace treaty among countries along the Asian and Pacific coasts and turning this region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

The commentary said that this important initiative was put forward by the Government of the People's Republic of China as early as 1955, and at that time, it had already received widespread and warm welcome from Asian and world public opinion. The reason it could not be implemented was because it was undermined by US imperialism and its lackeys.

The commentary also pointed out, "US imperialism is stepping up preparations for war in Asia. It recently signed the new Japan-US military treaty with Japan, and the Southeast Asian military aggressive bloc headed by the United States is strengthening its provocative activities against peace-loving countries in Asia. While carrying out the above-mentioned provocations and aggressive activities, US imperialism and its lackeys are also doing everything possible to slander China, attempting to alienate the relationship between China and Asian nationalist countries."

The commentary emphasized, "Under this situation, Premier Zhou Enlai's renewed proposal to build the Asian and Pacific region into a nuclear-weapon-free peace zone is of particular importance. This initiative reminds the Asian people to fully see through the war and aggression conspiracies of US imperialism and its lackeys, and to further strengthen unity in order to safeguard peace in Asia and the independence of Asian countries."

The commentary also pointed out that Premier Zhou Enlai's initiative illustrates that the foreign policy of the Government of the People's Republic of China is: peace-loving and resolutely defending peace. The commentary said, "The recent achievements of China's negotiations with Nepal and Burma on border issues, China's efforts to properly resolve the Sino-Indian border issue and the Indonesian Overseas Chinese issue, as well as Premier Zhou Enlai's above-mentioned peace initiative, fully expose the despicable behavior of US imperialism in slandering China’s 'aggressive' ambitions towards its neighbors and Asian countries. The Chinese government's consistent peaceful diplomatic policy is shining more and more like the sun. How can the blood-stained claws of US imperialism cover it up!"

The commentary said, "The Vietnamese people once again warmly welcome Premier Zhou Enlai's peace initiative. We, together with the fraternal Chinese people, and the people of peace-loving countries in Asia and around the world, will go all out to carry out unremitting struggles against imperialist aggression in order to safeguard peace and security in the Asian and Pacific regions."

    越“人民报”支持周总理和平倡议
    亚洲人民更加看清美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略政策
    越中两国人民全力以赴为反对帝国主义侵略而斗争
    新华社河内12日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论，再次表示坚决支持中国总理周恩来关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国缔结一项互不侵犯的和平公约和把这个地区建成为无核武器地区的和平倡议。
    评论说，这是中华人民共和国政府早在1955年就提出来的重大倡议，并且在当时已经获得了亚洲和世界舆论广泛的热烈欢迎。它之所以没有能够付诸实现，是因为遭到美帝国主义及其走狗的破坏。
    评论还指出，“美帝国主义正在亚洲加紧准备战争。它最近同日本签订了新日美军事条约，以美国为首的东南亚军事侵略集团正在加强对亚洲爱好和平国家的挑衅活动。在进行上述挑衅和侵略活动的同时，美帝国主义及其走狗还千方百计地诬蔑中国，妄图离间中国同亚洲民族主义国家之间的关系”。
    评论强调指出，“在这种情势下，周恩来总理再一次提出把亚洲和太平洋地区建成无核武器的和平地区，具有特别重要的意义。这个倡议提醒亚洲人民要充分看清美帝国主义及其走狗的战争和侵略阴谋，并进一步加强团结，以维护亚洲的和平和亚洲各国的独立”。
    评论还指出，周恩来总理的倡议说明，中华人民共和国政府的外交政策是：爱好和平，坚决保卫和平。评论说，“中国同尼泊尔、缅甸最近关于边界问题谈判的成就，中国为妥善解决中印边界问题和印度尼西亚华侨问题所作出的努力，以及周恩来总理上述的和平倡议，充分揭穿了美帝国主义诬蔑中国对它的邻国和亚洲各国有‘侵略’野心的卑鄙行为。中国政府始终如一的和平外交政策越来越像太阳那样普放光芒，美帝国主义的沾满血污的魔掌，如何掩盖得了它呢！”
    评论说，“越南人民再一次热烈欢迎周恩来总理的和平倡议。我们和兄弟的中国人民，以及亚洲和全世界爱好和平国家的人民一起，全力以赴地为反对帝国主义的侵略而进行不懈的斗争，以维护亚洲和太平洋地区的和平和安全。”
