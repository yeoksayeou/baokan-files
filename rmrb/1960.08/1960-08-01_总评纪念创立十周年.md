Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 31st: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) held a ceremony at the Kudan Kaikan Hall in Tokyo this evening to commemorate its tenth anniversary.

    Sohyo Chairman Kaoru Ota emphasized in his speech that Sohyo has consistently opposed so-called labor-management cooperation and has united workers in unremitting struggles for a peaceful, independent, and democratic Japan and to improve the people's lives.

    Ota emphasized that Sohyo should live up to the expectations of the Japanese people, strive to accomplish the important task of safeguarding world peace, and further work to strengthen the unity of workers worldwide.

    Ota said that he was very pleased to be able to welcome the Chinese delegation, which had not been able to visit Japan for a long time, to participate in the commemorative ceremony and the Sohyo conference. He stated that Sohyo is willing to take this opportunity to redouble its efforts to establish peaceful relations between Japan and China.

    The commemorative ceremony was followed by a banquet at "Hannyaen" in the evening. About 500 people, including Sohyo executives and representatives of various industrial unions, attended the ceremony. Prominent figures from all walks of life in Japan, such as Inejiro Asanuma, Sanzō Nosaka, Iku Yasui, Yoshitaro Hirano, as well as trade union representatives from the Soviet Union, China, and five other countries, and representatives from the World Federation of Trade Unions, were also invited to attend the ceremony.

    At the meeting, Sohyo Chairman Kaoru Ota commended those who had contributed to the Japanese labor movement and presented commendation certificates to three former Sohyo chairmen and two former secretaries-general.

    All those present raised their glasses to congratulate Sohyo on its tenth anniversary and the unity of the world's working class. Foreign representatives held friendly talks with Japanese worker representatives at the meeting.
