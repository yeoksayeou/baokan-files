Xinhua News Agency, August 26th, Tokyo dispatch: In the Gion City council election held in Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan on the 25th, a candidate from the Japanese Communist Party was elected as a city councilor.

    This is the first time a Communist candidate has been elected to this city council. The elected candidate is Tetsuo Ota, executive committee member of the local branch of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union. The "Akahata" newspaper said that the victory of the Communist candidate was the result of the Communist Party's local committee actively carrying out an election campaign in cooperation with non-partisan activists.

Xinhua News Agency, August 28th, Tokyo dispatch: All six candidates of the Japanese Communist Party were elected in the Naze City council election in Kagoshima Prefecture, becoming the largest party in the Naze City council.

    This is the first time that the Japanese Communist Party has held the largest number of seats in Japanese councils at all levels. The election was voted on the 26th and the results were announced on the 27th.

    According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun" today, the fixed number of Naze City councilors is thirty. In addition to the six elected from the Japanese Communist Party, three were elected from the Socialist Party, one from the Liberal Democratic Party, and the remaining councilors are all non-partisans.

    The report said that the six elected councilors from the Japanese Communist Party received a total of 2,976 votes, accounting for 15.5% of the total votes. The Japanese Communist Party held four seats in the previous city council.

    In the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the Japanese Communist Party's propositions have been supported by the Japanese people, and its prestige has continued to increase. This situation is reflected to some extent in the recent local city council elections. Not long ago, Japanese Communist Party candidates achieved victories in councilor elections in Gion City in Hiroshima Prefecture and Minoh City in Osaka Prefecture.

    日本鹿儿岛名濑市议会选举揭晓
    日共候选人全部当选
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：在日本广岛县祗园市于25日举行的市议会选举中，日本共产党的一位候选人当选为市议员。
    这是在这个市议会中第一个当选的共产党候选人。当选者是日本国营铁道工会当地分会的执行委员太田哲雄。“赤旗报”说，共产党候选人的胜利是共产党地方委员会在无党派积极分子的合作下积极展开竞选运动的结果。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本共产党的六名候选人在鹿儿岛县名濑市议会选举中，全体当选，成为名濑市议会中的第一政党。
    在日本各级议会议席中日本共产党议席居第一位这是第一次。这次选举是在26日投票，27日揭晓的。
    据“读卖新闻”今天报道，名濑市议会议员的定额为三十名，其中除日本共产党当选六名外，社会党当选三名、自由民主党当选一名，其他议员都是无党派人士。
    消息说，六名日本共产党当选议员所获得的选票共为两千九百七十六张，占总票数的15.5％。日本共产党在上届市议会议席中占四席。
    在反对日美军事同盟条约斗争中，日本共产党的主张受到日本人民拥护，它的威信不断提高。这种情况在某种程度上反映到最近的地方市议会选举中。不久前，日本共产党候选人在广岛县祗园市和大阪府箕面市的议员选举中，都取得了胜利。
