Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 16th: According to a Vientiane radio broadcast tonight, Kong Le, Chairman of the Laotian Coup Committee, reiterated in response to letters from the people on the 16th that the Coup Committee guarantees adherence to a neutral policy and will strictly guard against sabotage by bad elements. Kong Le said that seven days have passed since the coup was launched on August 9th. The Coup Committee has received a large number of letters from all over the country and has read them all. The sincere support of all compatriots fills the Coup Committee with confidence and warmth.

Kong Le said that some letters from the people expressed support for the Coup Committee's neutral policy; some offered opinions on the implementation of the neutral policy and the work of the Coup Committee; some reminded the Chairman and all members of the Coup Committee to be vigilant against assassination by bad elements; some expressed their love for the Coup Committee and their willingness to be the committee's backing force when necessary; and some were condolence letters with gifts attached.

Kong Le, on behalf of the Coup Committee, expressed heartfelt gratitude to the Laotian people who wrote letters and stated: The Coup Committee guarantees its determination to adhere to and implement a neutral policy, and asks the people to give the Coup Committee more powerful support.

Kong Le stated that the Coup Committee will respect, patiently, and carefully study the opinions offered on the implementation of the neutral policy and the work of the committee, and asks everyone to be the committee's security ears and eyes so that the committee's work can achieve satisfactory results.

Kong Le said that the committee deeply understands that the Laotian people have long been ready to promote their patriotic spirit. The committee firmly guarantees that the committee will walk the same path as the Laotian people to realize the wishes of the Laotian people.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 17th: According to a Vientiane radio broadcast this morning, the Laotian National Assembly unanimously approved the new cabinet list proposed by Laotian Prime Minister Prince Phouma to the National Assembly on the 16th at a meeting held this morning.

Subsequently, Prince Phouma assured the National Assembly that the new government would implement the domestic and foreign policies he had announced.

Before the National Assembly approved the new cabinet list, Prince Phouma also spoke, expressing his determination to carry out the work tasks that had been put forward, because he believed that only one road could enable Laos to maintain peace.

He said, "I have announced that I will do everything possible to reconcile the Laotians and stop the mutual killings among the Laotians." When he talked about negotiations with the Lao Fighting Forces, he said, "An agreement was reached in 1957 (referring to the Vientiane Agreement - editor's note)." He said, "Just call on the brothers in the forest to come back and see what shortcomings there are in the implementation of the agreement. I believe that the brothers outside will come back and cooperate to continue to implement the resolutions."

He said, "Our major task is to normalize the situation in Laos. We will turn around and find our brothers. This work will be carried out soon, at the latest within fourteen days, fifteen days, three weeks, or a month."

It is reported that the Laotian National Assembly re-elected the speaker of the National Assembly on the 16th. Boun Oum Norasing was elected as the speaker of the National Assembly.

Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: Bangkok News: The Thai authorities, acting as active pawns of the United States, are plotting further interference in the Laotian coup. According to United Press International, the Thai cabinet held a meeting on the 16th to discuss the "Laotian crisis." It is reported that this meeting lasted for fourteen hours. After the meeting, Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat clamored in an inflammatory tone that a civil war was about to break out in Laos.

According to United Press International, Sarit Thanarat told reporters from the "Bangkok World" after the cabinet meeting that Phoumi Nosavan, the head of the pro-American warlord group in Laos, "is now taking action." Sarit Thanarat also said that he expected a civil war to break out between Phoumi Nosavan's royalist troops and Kong Le's paratroopers.

The United States is the mastermind behind this conspiracy. Although the new government of Laos has been established, a US State Department spokesman said on the 16th that "the US government has not yet received official confirmation of the formation of a new government in Laos, and therefore continues to recognize the (Somsanith) government established after the May elections." The US Chargé d'Affaires at the US Embassy in Thailand, Unger, also held a secret one-hour meeting with Thai Foreign Minister Khoman on the 16th. The Laotian Ambassador to Thailand also met with the Thai Foreign Minister on the same day.

United Press International today promoted that a Laotian Air Force C-47 aircraft distributed leaflets over Vientiane on the 15th signed by the so-called "Anti-Coup Committee." It is said that the leaflets stated that "troops loyal to the royal family" would soon "seize power" from the Coup Committee. The news agency also said that some leaflets had Phoumi Nosavan's signature.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 16th: According to the Vietnam News Agency: The pro-Ngo Dinh Diem "Liberty Newspaper" openly clamored on August 12th for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to interfere in the internal affairs of the Kingdom of Laos.

The American United Press International also reported on the same day that while the South Vietnamese authorities, under the command of the American aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization group, were frantically preparing to hold a meeting to discuss interfering in Laos, they sent a truck convoy from Saigon to Laos. At the same time, other pro-Ngo Dinh Diem newspapers and Saigon radio stations also incited Laotian reactionaries to attack and "recover" Vientiane, and to suppress the just struggle of the Laotian soldiers and people.

The Ngo Dinh Diem group's provocation is an attempt to pave the way for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to interfere in Laos in order to stop the struggle of the Laotian people against the pro-American reactionary government.

    美国指使泰国南越加紧策划干涉老挝的阴谋
    新华社河内16日电　据万象电台今天晚上广播，老挝政变委员会主席贡勒在16日答复人民的来信时再次表示，政变委员会保证坚持奉行中立政策，并且严防坏分子的捣乱。贡勒说，8月9日发动政变到现在已经七天了，政变委员会收到了全国各地的大批来信，并且已阅过了全部来信。全体同胞们的真心诚意的支持，使政变委员会充满信心并感到温暖。
    贡勒说，人民的来信中有的表示支持政变委员会的中立政策；有的对实现中立政策和政变委员会的工作提出了意见；有的提醒政变委员会主席和全体成员警惕坏分子的暗算；有的表示对政变委员会的爱戴，并愿意在必要时作委员会的后盾力量；还有的是附寄赠品的慰问信。
    贡勒代表政变委员会向来信的老挝人民表示由衷的感激。并且表示：政变委员会保证将决心坚持和实行中立政策，要求人民给予政变委员会更加有力的支持。
    贡勒表示，政变委员会将尊重并耐心地、仔细地研究对实行中立政策和委员会的工作提供的意见，并且要求大家作委员会的安全的耳目，以使委员会的工作取得圆满的结果。
    贡勒说，委员会深刻地理解到，老挝人民早就时刻准备着发扬自己的爱国精神。委员会坚决地保证，委员会将和老挝人民走同一条路，以实现老挝人民的愿望。
    新华社河内17日电　据万象电台今天上午广播，老挝国民议会在今天上午举行的会议上，一致通过了老挝新首相富马亲王16日向国民议会提出的新内阁名单。
    随后，富马亲王向国民议会保证，新政府将实现他所宣布的对内对外政策。
    在国民议会通过新内阁名单前，富马亲王还曾经讲话，表示要坚决进行已经提出来的工作任务，因为他认为只有一条道路能使老挝保持和平。
    他说，“我曾经宣布我将想尽办法使老挝人和睦起来，停止老挝人之间的互相残杀。”他在谈到和寮国战斗部队谈判的问题时说“1957年就达成协议了（指万象协议——编者注）”。他说，“只要呼吁在森林里的兄弟们回来，看看协议的履行还有什么缺陷就可以了。我相信在外边的兄弟们将会回来，一起合作以继续贯彻各项决议。”
    他说，“我们的重大的任务是使老挝情况正常化。我们将回过头来，把我们的兄弟找回来。这个工作不久就要进行，最迟是十四天，十五天，三个礼拜或者一个月之内。”
    据报道，老挝国民议会16日改选了国民议会的议长。布文·诺拉辛当选为国民议会议长。
    据新华社17日讯　曼谷消息：充当美国积极走卒的泰国当局，正策划进一步干涉老挝政变。据合众国际社报道，泰国内阁在16日举行了会议，讨论“老挝危机”。据报道，这次会议竟一连开了十四个小时。会后泰国总理乃沙立以煽动口吻叫嚷，老挝要发生内战。
    据合众国际社报道，乃沙立在内阁会议后对“曼谷世界报”记者发表谈话说，老挝亲美军阀集团头子富米·诺萨万“现在正在采取行动中”。乃沙立还说，他预料富米·诺萨万的效忠王室的军队同贡勒的伞兵之间要打内战。
    美国是策划这种阴谋的主谋。虽然老挝新政府已经成立，但是美国国务院发言人16日仍说，“对于老挝组成新政府一事，美国政府至今没有得到正式的证实，因此继续承认5月选举之后成立的（松萨尼特）政府。”美国驻泰国大使馆的代办昂格在16日又和泰国外交部长科曼密谈了一小时。老挝驻泰国大使也在同一天会见了泰国外交部长。
    合众国际社今天宣传说，有一架老挝空军C—47型飞机，15日在万象上空散发了署名所谓“反政变委员会”的传单，据说，传单说，“忠于王室的军队”不久就要从政变委员会手中“夺取政权”。这家通讯社还说，有些传单有富米·诺萨万的签字。
    据新华社河内16日电　据越南通讯社报道：亲吴庭艳的“自由报”8月12日公开扬言要东南亚条约组织干涉老挝王国的内政。
    美国的合众国际社同一天也报道，南越当局已在美国指挥的侵略性的东南亚条约组织集团疯狂地准备开会讨论干涉老挝的时候，从西贡派出了一个卡车运输队前往老挝。同时，亲吴庭艳的其他报纸和西贡电台还煽动老挝的反动派进攻和“收复”万象，并镇压老挝军人和人民的正义斗争。
    吴庭艳集团的挑衅是企图为东南亚条约组织对老挝进行干涉铺平道路，以制止老挝人民反对亲美的反动政府的斗争。
