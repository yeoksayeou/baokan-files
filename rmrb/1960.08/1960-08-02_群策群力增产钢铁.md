	Zhejiang's industrial, transportation, construction, and commercial sectors work together to push steel production to a new high tide.
	Guizhou vigorously builds raw material and fuel bases around steel enterprises to ensure sustained steel production.
	Inner Mongolia coal mine workers deeply carry out technological revolution to increase raw coal production to meet the needs of smelting bases.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 1st: Zhejiang Province's steel front workers are carrying out a steel production movement centered on achieving high quality, high yield, and low cost, pushing steel production to a new high tide. As of July 25th, the province's daily pig iron output increased by 14.8% compared to late June, steel increased by 67.9%, and the pig iron qualification rate increased by 25.5%.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of this movement and promote the continued leap forward of steel production on the basis of the leap forward in the first half of the year, industrial leading cadres throughout the province, from the provincial party secretary to the industrial secretaries of the prefectural, municipal, and county party committees, have generally gone to the grassroots level, delved into the front line of production, participated in production, and commanded on the spot, earnestly solving specific problems.
    In the midst of the heated battle, steel and mining enterprises in various regions have identified their own weakest links and production key points in accordance with the requirements of high quality, high yield, and low cost, and have broken through them one by one. In order to break through the fuel barrier, the Shaoxing Steel Plant's Party Committee led cadres to the coking and ironmaking workshops, and together with the workers, they found fifteen loopholes, and are mobilizing the workers to plug them one by one. The second ironmaking workshop of this plant has successively solved seventeen specific problems, so that the pig iron output in the first and middle ten days of July increased by 6.97% compared with the same period in June, and the pig iron qualification rate increased to 80.66%. Since entering the last ten days of July, it has reached 100% every day.
    The leading departments on all fronts of coal, coke, mining, electricity, and transportation in Zhejiang Province have all regarded ensuring steel production as the top priority, and quickly set off a vigorous upsurge of supporting steel production. In the first and middle ten days of July, the province has formed 72 steel transportation lines, and the average daily transportation volume of "three materials" for several major steel plants has increased sharply by 26% compared with the same period in June. The power industry department quickly adjusted the load and seized the construction of new power plants, factory and mine self-supplied power stations, and transmission lines to increase more power sources. The province's basic construction departments have also listed basic construction projects such as mining, steel, and railways, highways, and power plants serving metallurgy as the top priorities, concentrating efforts to organize assaults. The Provincial Department of Mechanical Industry organized a special force to conduct a thorough investigation and queue up of each equipment manufacturing project related to steel plants, power stations, and mines, and each production unit went all out to complete delivery ahead of schedule. The material department did everything possible to do a good job in the distribution and supply of materials. Commercial departments delivered daily necessities, non-staple foods, etc. to the front of the furnace, underground, and mines. This kind of cooperation and support from all walks of life has powerfully promoted the improvement of steel enterprise production.

    Our newspaper, Guiyang, August 1st: Guizhou Province is vigorously building raw material and fuel production bases that are matched with steel base points, ensuring the continuous increase in steel and iron production.
    While arranging steel production and construction at the beginning of this year, Guizhou Province arranged a total of sixty-one raw material and fuel matching base constructions around the main steel base points. These raw material and fuel bases have carried out construction in two aspects: one is to vigorously transform production technology, and the other is to build new and expand production capacity. Fifteen iron mines such as Guanyin Mountain, Pinghuang Mountain, Yunwu Mountain, and Daoyan have greatly built indigenous and simple machinery and built mine transportation networks in the two major links of mining and mine area transportation, so that the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of these mines has been generally improved, and they have basically gotten rid of heavy physical labor in mining and transportation operations, and the production level has increased by one to six times compared with the past. In order to ensure the normal production of several new blast furnaces in this steel plant, the employees of Weicheng Iron Mine, which is matched with Guiyang Steel Plant, expanded two mining areas on their own, and built light rails, highways, aerial cableways, and chutes, so that the average monthly output of ore this year increased by three times compared with last year.
    In order to ensure the continuous leap forward in steel production, party committees and relevant units in various regions have given priority to supplying materials needed for the construction of raw material and fuel bases. Metallurgy, machinery, basic construction, transportation, and other departments have drawn a considerable number of veteran workers and technicians to go to the mines, down to the coal mines, and to the coking plants to help with construction.

    Our newspaper, Hohhot, August 1st: Workers of all ethnic groups in more than one hundred large, medium, and small coal mines in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, encouraged greater efforts, carried out technological innovation and technological revolution movements centered on increasing coal production. According to the statistics of the four mining bureaus of Baotou, Zhalainuoer, Wuda, and Zhuozishan, the raw coal output from January to July this year increased by 1.42 times compared with the same period last year. While achieving high production in July, the cost of raw coal decreased by 22% compared with the beginning of the year. Each mining area also promptly transported the raw coal to the steel production area through large-scale cooperation in production, transportation, and sales, so that the steel smelting bases in the region generally stored coal for half a month to a month.
    In the movement, various mines further promoted the advanced experience inside and outside the region, and systematically improved the mining methods, laying a good foundation for the continuous realization of high production in the future. By the end of July, coal areas throughout the region had realized fourteen automatic lines for coal mining, coal preparation, etc. The workers of the Xilutian Mining Area of ​​the Pingzhuang Coal Mine in Zhaowuda League created a mining method of hydraulically stripping topsoil, which greatly improved the progress of stripping. It not only uses three less electric shovels, forty-eight automatic dump trucks, and six locomotives every day, but also saves the country more than 3,500 tons of steel every year. The mining workers in this mining area became more and more energetic after entering July, and completed the monthly plan 600 cubic meters ahead of schedule in July.
    In improving coal production, the coal industrial departments of the autonomous region have also built a large number of small coal kilns in various places, making the layout of the coal industry in the region more reasonable, which is conducive to the rapid development of steel production.

    群策群力增产钢铁
    浙江工业、交通、基建、商业部门协力把钢铁生产推向新高潮
  贵　州围绕钢铁企业大力建设原料燃料基地保证钢铁持续增产  内蒙古煤炭职工深入开展技术革命增产原煤供应冶炼基地需要
    据新华社杭州1日电　浙江省钢铁战线职工正在开展以实现优质高产低成本为中心目标的钢铁生产运动，把钢铁生产推向了新的高潮。到7月25日止，全省生铁日产量比6月下旬提高14.8％，钢提高67.9％，生铁合格率提高25.5％。
    为了加强对这一运动的领导，以促进钢铁生产在上半年跃进的基础上继续跃进，全省工业领导干部，从省委书记到地、市、县委的工业书记，普遍下到基层，深入生产第一线，参加生产，坐阵指挥，扎扎实实地解决具体问题。
    在热火朝天的战斗中，各地钢铁矿山企业都根据优质、高产、低成本的要求，找出自身最薄弱的环节和生产关键，一个个地加以突破。绍兴钢铁厂党委为突破燃料关，领导干部到炼焦和炼铁车间，和工人一起共找到了十五处漏洞，正发动工人一个个地加以堵塞。这个厂的第二炼铁车间，先后解决了十七个具体问题，使7月上、中旬生铁产量比6月同期增长6.97％，生铁合格率提高到80.66％，进入下旬以来，天天达到百分之百。
    浙江省煤、焦、矿、电、运输等各条战线上的领导部门，都把保证钢铁生产当作头等重要任务，很快掀起了轰轰烈烈的支援钢铁生产的热潮。7月上、中旬全省已组成钢铁运输线七十二条，几个主要钢铁厂的“三料”每日平均运输量比6月同期猛增26％。电力工业部门迅速调整了负荷，并抓紧新建电厂、厂矿自备电站和输电线路的建设，增加更多的电源。全省基本建设部门也把采掘、钢铁以及为冶金服务的铁路、公路、电厂等基本建设项目列为重点中的重点，集中力量组织突击。省机械工业厅组织了专门力量，对每一个有关钢铁厂、电站和矿山的设备制造项目进行了摸底排队，各生产单位全力以赴，提前完成交货。物资部门千方百计做好物资的分配和供应工作。商业部门将生活日用品、副食品等送到炉前、井下和矿场。各行各业的这种协作和支援，有力地促进了钢铁企业生产的提高。
    本报贵阳1日电　贵州省大力建设与钢铁基点相对口的原料、燃料生产基地，保证了钢、铁产量的不断提高。
    贵州省在今年年初安排钢铁生产建设的同时，全省围绕主要的钢铁基点，共安排了六十一个原料、燃料对口基地的建设。这些原料、燃料基地都进行了两个方面的建设：一是大力改造生产技术，一是新建和扩建生产能力。观音山、平黄山、云雾山和倒岩等十五个铁矿，在采掘和矿区运输两大环节上，大造土简机具和建设矿区运输网，使这些矿山生产机械化半机械化程度普遍提高，采掘和运输作业中已基本摆脱了笨重的体力劳动，生产水平比过去分别提高一至六倍。与贵阳钢铁厂对口的卫城铁矿，为了保证这个钢铁厂新建的几座高炉的正常生产，职工们自己动手扩建了两个采矿区，建设了轻便轨道、公路、空中索道和滑槽，使今年矿石平均月产量比去年增加了三倍。
    为了保证钢铁生产持续跃进，各地党委和有关单位，都优先供应建设原料、燃料基地需要的物资。冶金、机械、基本建设、运输等部门，都抽出了相当数量的老工人、技术员，上矿山，下煤井，到焦厂，帮助建设。
    本报呼和浩特1日电　内蒙古自治区一百多个大中小型煤矿的各族职工，鼓起更大的干劲，开展以增产煤炭为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。据包头、扎赉诺尔、乌达和卓子山等四个矿务局的统计，今年1至7月份的原煤产量比去年同期增长了一点四二倍。在7月份实现高产的同时，原煤成本比年初降低了22％。各矿区还通过产、运、销等方面的大协作，把原煤及时运到钢铁生产用地，使全区钢铁冶炼基地一般都储存了半个月到一个月的煤炭。
    在运动中，各矿进一步推广了区内外的先进经验，有步骤有系统地改进了采掘方法，为今后持续实现高产打下了良好的基础。到7月底，全区各煤区已实现了十四条采煤选煤等自动线。昭乌达盟平庄煤矿西露天矿区职工创造了水力剥离表土的采掘方法，剥离日进度大大提高，不仅每天少用三部电铲、四十八部自动翻车和六部机车，而且每年可给国家节约钢材三千五百多吨。这个矿区的采掘职工，进入7月份以后，干劲越来越大，7月份超额六百立方米提前完成了月计划。
    在提高煤炭生产中，自治区各煤炭工业部门，还在各地建起了大批小煤窑，使全区的煤炭工业布局更加合理，有利于钢铁生产的迅速发展。
