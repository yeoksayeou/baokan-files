Sincerity, Dedication, Perseverance
Shanghai Tongxing Industrial Cooperative Worker Tao Youzhi

On July 5th, the Shanghai Liberation Daily published a front-page news story about Comrade Wang Xiaobao, the Party Branch Secretary of the North Spinning Workshop of the No. 1 State-owned Cotton Factory, who "stuck to the 'four togethers' for eight years and became a confidante of the masses." Everyone was deeply moved after reading it, believing that Comrade Wang Xiaobao's deeds are indeed worth learning from and serve as an excellent example for cadres improving their work style and going deep into the front lines of production.

Why was she able to achieve this, to solve problems considered difficult to resolve? What is the secret? I believe it lies in her sincerity, dedication, and perseverance towards the workers.

Sincerity. As the workers said, Comrade Wang Xiaobao's presence in the workshop isn't just wandering around; instead, she takes action, going wherever there are difficulties and refusing to leave until the problems are resolved. For example, during the first quarter of last year, in order to adapt to the leap forward situation, improve product quality, and speed up the machines, the number of yarn breakages suddenly increased sharply, with more empty spindles and more roller lapping. At that time, some comrades among the staff had some wavering thoughts, thinking that our foundation was too poor to compare with advanced factories. It was at this time that Comrade Wang Xiaobao decided to work as a spinner herself in the fine spinning workshop. The branch secretary picked out two machines with the fewest yarn breakages and the easiest to operate for her, but Comrade Wang Xiaobao refused. She had already found two machines with the most yarn breakages and the most "problematic." Why? Comrade Wang Xiaobao thought this way: going to the workshop to work is to discover problems and solve problems. If you find easy machines to work on, what's the point? Because of her sincerity and dedication, and by discussing and consulting with the masses, after several days of exploration, she finally tamed these two "problematic" machines.

Unity of body and mind; wherever the person is, the heart is there. In the words of the masses: that is "sincerity." This is her first characteristic.

Dedication. After she goes to the workshop, she doesn't just touch this and grab that, or bury herself in piles of paperwork. Instead, she grasps the main point, studies it, analyzes it, and finds out where the root of the problem lies. For example, when she was taming the two "problematic" machines, she did just that, operating while carefully analyzing why there were so many yarn breakages. After analyzing, she felt that the real yarn breakages were only two to three hundred, and under such circumstances, even the slowest workers could clear them up. Why couldn't they keep up? She also found that most of the yarn breakages were caused by human error, and most of the human-caused yarn breakages were caused by not being able to implement the work methods in time. After she thought, did, and researched in this way, she improved the operating methods, and by the second half of the night, the yarn breakages were indeed cleared up, solving the key problems in the workshop.

Comrade Wang Xiaobao is not only dedicated in production but also seriously dedicated to the lives of the masses. The North Spinning Workshop has more than 1,300 workers, and Comrade Wang Xiaobao can call out the names of more than 90% of them, and she understands their thoughts, temperaments, and family situations. Therefore, the workers are willing to tell her what's on their minds, which greatly encourages their enthusiasm for production, and also allows her to easily discover and solve problems with the masses as her eyes.

Perseverance. For eight years, she has persisted in going deep into the front lines of production, deep among the masses, integrating with the masses, always sharing the hearts and minds of the Party and the masses, sharing their breath, and persisting to the end. This is what has enabled her to become familiar with every machine and every nail in the workshop and to grasp and understand everyone's actions, thus achieving this glorious achievement. Without such perseverance, it would be difficult to obtain this achievement.

From this, it seems that if we want to solve key production problems, achieve large-scale harvests, and truly change the work style of cadres to go deep into the front lines of production, I think we must learn Comrade Wang Xiaobao's spirit very well and strive to cultivate these three hearts, none of which can be missing.

    诚心  钻心  恒心	上海同兴实业社工人　陶友之
    7月5日，上海解放日报头条新闻上报道了“坚持四同八年整，成了群众知心人”的中共国棉一厂北纺车间总支书记王小宝同志的事迹，大家看了以后，深为感动，认为王小宝同志的事迹确值得学习，是当前干部改进作风、深入生产第一线中的一个很好榜样。
    她为什么能取得这个成就，能解决认为难以解决的关键？这个秘方在什么地方？我认为就在于她对工人诚心、钻心、恒心。
    诚心。正像工人们所说：王小宝同志的下车间，不是东荡西荡，而是做来做去，哪里有困难、她就到哪里，不把问题解决，决不离开。像去年第一季度，为了适应跃进形势，提高产品质量，加快了车速，可是断头却突然大增，空锭多了，皮辊花多了……当时，有些职工同志思想有些波动，认为我们究竟底子太差，不能和人家先进厂比。正在这时，王小宝同志决定自己到细纱间去挡车。当时班支部书记给她拣了二部断头最少、最好挡的车，可是王小宝同志不要，她自己早找好了二部断头最多，最“老爷”的车。为什么？王小宝同志是这样想的，下车间挡车是为了发现问题，解决问题，如果找好做的车，有什么意义呢？由于她的诚心专意，和群众共商量、共讨论，经过几天的摸索，这两部“老爷”车终于给她驯服了。
    身心一致，人到哪里，心到哪里。拿群众的话说：就是“诚心”。这是她的第一个特点。
    钻心。她下车间以后，不是东摸西摸，东抓西抓，或是钻在事务堆里；而是抓住主要一点，加以研究、分析，找出毛病的根源到底在哪里。比如她在驯服二台“老爷”车的时候，就是这样，边操作边用心地分析断头为什么这样多，经过分析以后，觉得真正的断头也不过二百到三百根，按这样的情况，即使是手脚最慢的工人，头也能接清的，现在为什么来不及呢？她又发现主要是人为的断头多，而人为的断头，大多是由于来不及执行工作法而造成的。经过她这样边做边想边研究，改进了操作方法，到下半夜，断头果然就接清了，解决了车间中的关键问题。
    王小宝同志不仅在生产上是这样的钻，在群众的生活上也是认真地钻的，北纺车间有一千三百多个工人，王小宝同志对其中90％以上的人，都能叫得出名字来，而且了解他们的思想、脾气和家庭情况，因此工人们有什么心里话都愿意讲给她听，使群众和领导打成一片，大大鼓励了生产热情，同时由于有了群众做眼睛，就使她容易发现问题，解决问题。
    恒心。她八年来一直坚持深入生产第一线，深入群众，同群众打成一片，始终同党和群众心心相印，呼吸与共，坚持到底，才使她摸熟了车间中的一机一钉，掌握并了解了人们的一举一动，因此取得了这个光辉成绩，要不是这样持之以恒，获得这个成绩是困难的。
    由此看来，我们要想解决生产关键问题，获得大面积丰收，真正改变干部作风，做到深入生产第一线，我看必须很好学习王小宝同志的这种精神，努力培植这三颗心，缺一不可。
