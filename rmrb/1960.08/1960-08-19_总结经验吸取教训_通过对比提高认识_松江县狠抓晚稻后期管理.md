This newspaper reports:
    Shanghai, August 18th. Songjiang County, Shanghai, having victoriously concluded the double-cropping rice harvesting and planting, immediately deployed efforts to fight an all-out battle in August and September to seize a bumper autumn grain harvest. It mobilized cadres and commune members to boost their energy, advance victoriously, and launched a production upsurge on the agricultural front.

    In order to mobilize the entire Party and the entire people to engage in the battle of seizing a bumper harvest in August and September, the Songjiang County Party Committee convened a telephone conference on August 8th. Zhao Ren, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, called on the entire county to seize the crucial period of August and September, boost their energy, strengthen late rice field management, and strive for a bumper harvest.

    According to the instructions of the County Party Committee, the Party Committees of each commune conducted careful studies and universally convened cadre and commune member meetings to mobilize. Chengdong, Chengxi, and other communes also gathered cadres above the level of small team leader and held a swearing-in conference of "Fighting Hard in August and September to Seize a Bumper Autumn Harvest." Through summarizing the achievements of the previous stage of work from top to bottom, analyzing future tasks, and recalling the experiences and lessons of planting late rice last year and early rice this year, they further recognized the importance of fighting hard in August and September. The Lianxing Team of Chengxi Commune used the experiences and lessons of the First and Sixth Small Teams in planting single-season late rice last year for comparison at a meeting of cadres and activists. The single-season late rice of the First Small Team grew very well in the early stage. In all previous evaluations, the team received the red flag. However, the cadres later developed complacency and slackness, relaxed late-stage management, and only received 693 jin per mu. The Sixth Small Team, on the other hand, had poor early-stage management and the single-season late rice growth was relatively poor, but they learned from their lessons and greatly increased late-stage management measures. As a result, the rice seedlings grew better than those of the First Small Team, yielding 759 jin per mu. From this comparison, everyone learned a lesson: good early-stage management is not enough, good late-stage management is the key to true success, and late-stage management must be tightened to win a bumper harvest of single-season late rice. Some commune members of the Hujiadai Production Team of Xinbang Commune developed a sense of relaxation after rushing to harvest and plant double-cropping rice. Some also believed that late-stage management of single-season late rice did not require much effort. The Party branch of the production team then launched a discussion among the commune members on "Is late-stage management of late rice of great value?" Through discussion, many commune members used their own experiences to illustrate that August and September are the key periods for seizing a bumper rice harvest and that there can be no relaxation. These examples were very educational for everyone, so many commune members said: "Add more effort in the autumn. The grass grows before autumn, the rice grows after autumn; Good before autumn means good rice straw, good after autumn means good grain." The Party branch of the Shaqi Production Team of Caojing Commune mobilized commune members to summarize the experience of this year's bumper early rice harvest. An important lesson was "Manage as soon as you plant, manage from beginning to end," which made everyone realize the importance of strengthening field management and boosted the confidence and determination of the commune members to fight hard in August and September and seize a bumper autumn harvest.

    Through ideological work, the vast number of cadres and commune members of Songjiang County's communes have greatly improved their thinking and have a higher enthusiasm for production in August and September. The work style of cadres has also been further transformed. Many production teams and small teams have made plans based on the production requirements of August and September. The Hujiadai Production Team of Xinbang Commune lacked a lot of fertilizer, and the Party branch immediately made a fertilizer accumulation plan with the commune members, dispatching more than 100 people every day to accumulate fertilizer on a large scale. Within two days, they had accumulated 50,000 dan of various fertilizers. Each production team of the Xinwu Commune has recently carried out evaluations and inspections of autumn-ripe field management. They found that there were many barnyard grasses in the fields, which affected the growth of rice seedlings. They then organized forces to rush to remove barnyard grass, and within three days, they removed barnyard grass from more than 6,000 mu of late rice fields. (Attached picture)

### 总结经验吸取教训　通过对比提高认识  松江县狠抓晚稻后期管理

    总结经验吸取教训　通过对比提高认识
    松江县狠抓晚稻后期管理
    本报讯　上海市松江县在胜利结束双季稻抢收抢种的基础上，立即部署大战8、9月夺取秋粮大丰收的战役，动员广大干部和社员大鼓干劲，乘胜急进，在农业战线上掀起了生产高潮。
    为了动员全党全民投入8、9两月夺取大丰收的战斗，中共松江县委在8月8日召开电话会议。县委第一书记赵仁号召全县抓住8、9两个月关键时期，大鼓干劲，加强晚稻田间管理，力夺丰收。
    根据县委指示，松江各公社党委都作了认真研究，普遍召开了干部、社员大会作了动员。城东、城西等公社还召集了小队长以上干部开了“大战8、9月，夺取秋熟大丰收”的誓师大会，通过自上而下地层层总结前段工作成绩，分析今后任务，回忆去年种植晚稻及今年种植早稻的经验教训，进一步认识到大战8、9月的重要性。城西公社联星队在干部、积极分子会议上，以第一、第六小队去年种植单季晚稻的经验教训作了对比。一小队去年单季晚稻初期生长很好，全队历次评比，都得红旗，但后来干部产生了自满麻痹思想，放松了后期管理，每亩仅收到六百九十三斤。而六小队原来前期管理不好，单季晚稻生长较差，却接受了教训，后期管理措施大大加码，结果，稻苗长势反而超过了一小队，亩产七百五十九斤。从这个对比中，大家都得到了教训：前期管理好还不够，后期也抓好才是真正好，要夺单季晚稻大丰收，后期管理必须抓紧。新浜公社胡家埭生产队有些社员在抢收抢种双季稻后，产生了松劲情绪，有些人还认为搞单季晚稻后期管理，不需要下大劲了。生产队党支部就发动社员进行了“晚稻后期管理是否大有可为？”的讨论。通过讨论，很多社员都以自己的切身经历说明8、9两月是夺取水稻丰收的关键时期，不能松劲。这些事例对大家的教育都很深刻，因此很多社员说：“入了秋，更加油。秋前生的草，秋后生的稻；秋前好是稻柴好，秋后好才是粮食好。”漕泾公社沙碛生产队党支部发动社员一起来总结今年早稻大丰收经验，其中很重要的一条是“一种就管，一管到底”，从而使大家认识到加强田间管理的重要性，鼓舞了广大社员大战8、9月，夺取秋熟丰收的信心与决心。
    松江县各公社广大干部社员通过务虚，思想大大提高，对大战8、9月的生产劲头更高，干部作风也有了进一步的转变，很多生产队、小队都根据8、9月份生产要求，作出了打算。新浜公社胡家埭生产队肥料缺得多，党支部立即同社员一起作出了积肥计划，每天出动一百多人，大搞积肥，两天内已积到各种肥料五万担。新五公社各生产队在最近都开展了秋熟田间管理的评比检查，发现田内稗草较多，影响稻苗生长，就组织力量突击拔稗草，三天内即在六千多亩晚稻田里拔除了稗草。（附图片）
