    Liubu Commune Receives Strong Support from Jinan Diesel Engine Plant
    Strengthening Commune-Run Industry and Promoting Agricultural Production

    (Our dispatch) Shandong Licheng Liubu People's Commune, with the strong support of Jinan Diesel Engine Plant, has equipped its commune-run factories, cultivated a large number of technical personnel, and promoted the development of agricultural production.
    Liubu Commune is located in a mountainous area with abundant mountain fruits. Every autumn, it is necessary to harvest both crops and mountain fruits. In the past, due to insufficient transportation tools and labor, sweet potatoes and mountain fruits often rotted. This year, coupled with a continuous drought of more than 150 days, the struggle against drought has made the labor force even more strained. The commune wanted to innovate tools to save labor, but it had only one factory, with only two old lathes, a thirty-jin pig iron furnace, and more than a hundred carpenters, masons, and blacksmiths. They could only repair general agricultural implements, and larger and more complex agricultural implements had to be repaired and fitted in Jinan. According to the mountainous characteristics of Liubu Commune, Jinan Diesel Engine Plant first transferred a part of its machinery to equip the commune-run factory. At the same time, it adopted a "package deal" approach, sending its best technicians to the commune-run factory and various production brigades to impart technology to workers and commune members. In addition, it invited the commune to send people to the factory to learn technology. Thanks to the strong support of Jinan Diesel Engine Plant in equipment and technology, the commune has achieved the goal of small repairs within the team and medium repairs within the commune in terms of agricultural machinery repair, and is also able to manufacture agricultural implements. This year, more than 410 types of tools have been innovated. For example, replacing the hand-pushed mill, which requires a lot of labor to process wheat manually, with a steel mill has saved a lot of labor. A six-inch steel mill can grind 1,000 jin of wheat in eight hours, while a hand-pushed stone mill could only grind 100 jin a day in the past. Now each production brigade has one or two steel mills, and the canteens of ten production teams have realized steel mill processing of wheat. In addition, some cooking utensils have also been improved, and 41 types of agricultural tools such as chaff cutters, crushers, sweet potato slicers, and powered rollers have been produced, totaling more than 8,000 pieces. Due to the promotion and use of new tools, the commune saved 600,000 workdays in the first half of the year, which greatly strengthened the forces on the agricultural production front. During the drought resistance and wheat protection efforts, all 37 diesel engines in the commune were operating normally due to timely maintenance and spare parts supply. This year, the irrigated area reached more than 12,000 mu, an increase of more than 5,000 mu compared to last year, and most of them are high mountain ridge lands. The Huangchao Brigade behind Mount Tai and the Dahui Brigade surrounded by mountains have irrigated more than 300 mu of mountain land for the first time in history. The wheat that has been irrigated has increased production by an average of about 30% per mu. By the end of July, the commune's 20,000 mu of autumn corn had not only been weeded once, but also fertilized and trenched. The 30,000 mu of spring sweet potatoes are completely free of weeds.
    At present, whether it is the commune's repair and assembly plant or the repair and assembly groups and carpentry groups of various production brigades, a scene of busy activity is everywhere. Batches of finished and semi-finished sweet potato slicers, five-row close-planting drills, chaff cutters, powered rollers, persimmon peelers, feed crushers, and other autumn harvest and autumn planting tools are being continuously manufactured.

### 柳埠公社得到济南柴油机厂有力支援  壮大社办工业促进农业生产

    柳埠公社得到济南柴油机厂有力支援
    壮大社办工业促进农业生产
    本报讯　山东历城柳埠人民公社在济南柴油机厂大力支援下，武装了社办工厂，培养了大批技术人材，促进了农业生产的发展。
    柳埠公社是山区，山果很多，每年秋季既要收庄稼，又要收山果，往年常常因运输工具和劳动力不足，要烂掉甘薯和山果。加上今年又遇到了持续一百五十多天未下雨，进行抗旱斗争，劳动力就显得更紧张了。公社想要革新工具以节省劳力，但公社只有一个工厂，工厂里只有两部旧车床，一个三十斤的化铁炉，百多名木、瓦、铁匠，只能修理一般农具，较大和复杂一点的农具都得到济南去修配。济南柴油机厂根据柳埠公社的山区特点，首先抽调了一部分机器武装了社办工厂，同时，采取一包到底的办法，先后派出最好的技术人员到社办工厂和各大队向工人和社员传授技术；另外又请公社派人到工厂来学习技术。由于得到了济南柴油机厂在设备和技术上的大力帮助，这个公社在农业机械修理上已经实现了小修不出队，中修不出社的要求，并且也能制造农具了。今年先后革新工具四百一十多种，如把占用劳动力较多的人工加工麦子的手推磨，改为钢磨，就节省了大量劳动力。一台六寸的钢磨，八小时能磨一千斤小麦；而过去人推石磨，一天只能磨上一百斤。现在各生产大队都有一、二部钢磨，有十个生产队的食堂已经实现了麦子加工钢磨化；此外，还改进了一些炊事工具，生产了铡草机、粉碎机、地瓜切片机、动力碾等各项农业工具四十一种八千余件。由于推广使用新工具，全社上半年就节约劳动日六十万个，这就大大增强了农业生产战线上的力量。在抗旱保麦时，社里的三十七部柴油机，由于能够及时检修和供应零件，全部正常开动。今年的水浇地面积达一万二千多亩，比去年扩大了五千多亩，而且多是些高山岭地。泰山背后的黄巢大队和群山环抱的大会大队，有三百多亩山地破天荒第一次浇上了水。浇过水的小麦平均每亩约增产30％。到7月底止，全社二万亩秋玉米不仅全部锄了一遍草，还全部追了肥、培了沟，三万亩春甘薯根本不见草荒。
    目前，不论公社修配厂，还是各生产大队的修配组、木工组，到处呈现一片繁忙的景象。一批批成品、半成品的地瓜切片机、五行密植耧、铡草机、动力碾、柿子剥皮机、饲料粉碎机等秋收秋种工具正在不断地制造出来。
