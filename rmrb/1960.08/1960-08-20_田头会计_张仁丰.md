    "Field-Head Accountant" Zhang Renfeng
    The members of the Longshan People's Commune's Ke Gui Brigade in Xuyi County, Jiangsu Province, all call Zhang Renfeng, the accountant of the Longtan team, the "field-head accountant." Zhang Renfeng is twenty-nine years old this year. Since becoming a junior co-op accountant in 1956, he has insisted on laboring and working in the fields for five years. He always takes the lead in labor and faces difficulties head-on; he is proactive in his work, diligent and thrifty, and honest and selfless. He has twice been named a model team accountant by the brigade.
    
    Labor and Work Without Conflict
    The story of Zhang Renfeng working in the fields has had its twists and turns. When he first became a junior co-op accountant, he stayed indoors doing accounts all day and rarely went to the fields to participate in labor. When it came to evaluating work and recording work points in the evening, he was clueless, often working late into the night without being able to complete it. Sometimes, to ensure the commune members' sleep, he simply evaluated them once every ten days or half a month. As a result, even more problems arose with the evaluation and recording of work points. Some commune members said, "The accountant stays at home all day and doesn't know what he's doing. He doesn't labor with us, so the work points are unclear and unfair. How can this work?" Zhang Renfeng felt very uncomfortable hearing these opinions. He thought to himself, "Fairly evaluating and recording work points is a major task for an accountant. If I don't do it well, I'll be letting down the commune members." Later, Zhang Renfeng made up his mind to labor with the commune members and evaluate work in the fields, clearing the work points for the day on the same day. The problem of evaluating and recording work points was solved, but new problems arose in his work. He often had to run back and forth several times a day for work, wasting a lot of time, affecting his labor and also not doing a good job of accounting. This made Zhang Renfeng very distressed. Later, he came up with a solution: implement the "three carries" to the fields, that is, when going to the fields to labor, carry labor tools, an abacus, and a file folder (with account books inside). He worked and labored in the fields. In this way, the contradiction between labor and work was resolved. Later, Zhang Renfeng made a field office box, putting all the office supplies in the box, which made it even more convenient to carry. He also stuck a small triangular red flag in the field. If someone needed him, they could tell where he was at a glance.
    
    For several years, he has been using the method of field labor and field office work, combining labor and work very well. He has managed to complete about 200 workdays each year. From the autumn distribution last year to now, Zhang Renfeng has already completed 141 workdays, while time off work only accounts for 8 workdays. The number of workdays he has done is equal to that of the local strong laborers. At the same time, Zhang Renfeng's work is also very outstanding. The team's one account and six books are all in good order, the accounts are clear, the income and expenditure are recorded in detail, and everything is accurate. All kinds of accounts are cleared and settled monthly and announced in a timely manner. For several years, he has never missed an entry or failed to record a work point.
    
    Zhang Renfeng's good combination of labor and work is also due to his ability to scientifically arrange his time. Every morning, he carries his office box to the fields and labors alongside the commune members. If there is urgent work to be done, he uses the office box as a table and the field ridge as a stool, completing the work immediately. Before finishing work, he helps the team leader check the quality of production; organizes the commune members to evaluate work points, records them on the spot, issues work point vouchers, compiles daily production statistics, and writes statistical reports; and discusses the next day's production plan with the team leader and team committee in the fields, and announces it to the commune members on the spot, so that each commune member knows what they need to do the next day. In the evening, when the commune members rest, he adds up each commune member's work points for the day and the grain they ate in the canteen for the day, clears all kinds of accounts, and records them in the register. When it comes to settling and announcing accounts every ten days, he uses rainy days to settle accounts if it rains; if the weather is clear, he settles accounts in the evening.
    
    Every Little Bit for the Public, Increasing Collective Income
    After participating in labor, Zhang Renfeng further realized that material wealth does not come easily. Therefore, he is always concerned about the collective interests in his work, increasing income and saving expenses for the team in every possible way. One day last summer, he returned from a meeting in the commune and found that the rice paddies were dry. He rushed home, picked up a shovel, and left. His mother said, "The meal is ready, where are you going?" He turned around and explained it to his mother, then rushed to the field and spent more than two hours damming the water from the mountain stream, until the water flooded the field, and then he happily went home for dinner. In the fall, these four acres of land yielded more than 1,700 pounds of rice. After the rice was harvested, the commune members threshed it four times, but Zhang Renfeng found that it was still not clean, so he mobilized everyone to thresh it again, and as a result, they threshed more than 40 pounds of grain. Last autumn, the team did not have enough cattle fodder, and the cattle had no houses to live in during the winter. The male laborers were all at the reservoir, leaving only more than 20 women at home. He actively suggested to the team leader that he should lead the women to the mountains to cut grass. Under his lead and influence, more than 20 women spent three and a half days cutting more than 40,000 pounds of mountain grass. They used this grass to build three cattle houses, repair fifteen dilapidated houses, and make up for the lack of cattle fodder.
    
    He also saves as much as possible when it comes to spending money. Utensils such as water buckets, pot lids, and brooms in the canteen, as well as large agricultural implements such as carts and plows, are all repaired and made by him. In this regard alone, he saved the team more than 100 yuan last year.
    
    The Person the Commune Members Trust the Most
    Usually, Zhang Renfeng is fair and selfless and self-disciplined in his work. Last autumn, his mother picked up a few pounds of scattered beans and peanuts in the field. After he found out, he immediately persuaded her to hand over the beans and peanuts to the team. In April of this year, his mother fell ill, and someone advised him to take a few yuan from the public funds to treat his mother, and then pay it back later. He resolutely said, "I can't use public funds." Once, the team leader asked him to take two commune members to Jianxi Town, which was more than ten miles away, to sell peaches. Before leaving, the team leader gave him a few pounds of grain coupons and told him to have a meal in the town. They finished selling the peaches in the afternoon, and the two commune members were hungry and suggested going to a restaurant for a meal. Zhang Renfeng said to them, "The grain and money are earned by the hard work of the commune members. It costs money and grain coupons to eat in a restaurant. Let's hold on and go back to eat!" The two commune members were touched by his self-discipline and dedication to the public, and without saying a word, they carried the burdens and returned home. Precisely because he is fair and self-disciplined in his work, the commune members trust him very much and call him the most reliable person.
    
    Comrade Zhang Renfeng is very concerned about the illiteracy of some commune members. In addition to actively helping commune members write and read letters, he also reads newspapers to them whenever he has time. In order to help some commune members learn culture, he brings a blackboard and a literacy book with him every time he goes to the fields and teaches classes in the fields during breaks; when he returns home in the evening, he also tries to set aside a certain amount of time to organize young men and women to attend classes together. He delivers the words to the door to teach women with nursing babies and the elderly. After several years of his efforts, seventeen people in the team have already shed their illiterate hats.
    
    Zhang Renfeng's family life was poor before liberation, and life has been getting better day by day since liberation. Under the education and cultivation of the Party, he gradually understood that in order to live a happy life, he must do a good job in collective production and take care of everyone's affairs. With such a fervent heart, loyal to the Party, and loving the cause of socialism, he has been laboring and working selflessly for five years as if it were one day.

    “田头会计”张仁丰
    江苏盱眙县龙山公社克贵大队的社员都称龙潭小队的会计员张仁丰是“田头会计”。张仁丰今年二十九岁，自从1956年担任初级社会计到现在，五年来一直坚持在田头劳动，田头工作。他在劳动上处处带头，见困难就上；在工作上事事主动，克勤克俭，廉洁奉公。曾两次被大队评为模范小队会计员。
    劳动工作两不误
    提起张仁丰田头办公，可也经过一番曲折的道路。他在当初级社会计的时候，整天蹲在屋里弄账，很少到田头去参加劳动。晚上评工记分时，自己心中无数，往往弄到深更半夜也评不好。有时为了保证社员睡眠时间，就干脆十天半月评一次。这样一来，评工记分的问题就更多了。有的社员说：“会计成天在家不知干什么，不和我们一起劳动，工分不清不公，这样能行吗？”张仁丰听到这些意见，心里很不好受，心想：合理评工记分，是会计的一个主要工作，做不好，真对不起社员。以后，张仁丰就下定了决心，与社员一起劳动，在田头评工，当天工分当天清。评工记分的问题解决了，而工作上的新问题又出现了，往往因为工作，一天要往返跑好几趟，耽误了不少时间，劳动受影响，会计工作也没搞好。这使张仁丰很苦恼。后来，他想出了一个办法，实行“三带”下田，即在下田劳动时，带劳动工具、带算盘、带书夹子（夹着账本），在田头办公、田头劳动，这样做，劳动与工作的矛盾解决了。后来张仁丰又做了一个田头办公箱，把办公用具都放在箱子里，携带起来就更方便了。他还在田头插上一个三角小红旗，有事找他，一看就知道他在那里。
    几年来，他一直运用田头劳动、田头办公的方法，使劳动和工作结合得很好。每年他都要做到二百个左右的劳动日，去年秋季决分到现在，张仁丰已做了一百四十一个劳动日，而误工记工只有八个劳动日。他做的劳动日已和当地强劳力相等，同时张仁丰的工作也搞得很出色，小队的一账六簿，样样健全，账账清楚，收入支出，笔笔有账，项项对头，各种账目都做到日清月结及时公布，几年来，他从未错过一笔账，从未漏记一个工分。
    张仁丰的劳动和工作结合得好，还由于他善于科学地安排时间。每天一早，他背着办公箱下田，与社员并肩劳动。如有急办的事，就把办公箱当桌子，田埂当板凳，即时把工作办好。收工前就帮助队长检查生产质量；组织社员评好工分，当场记上账，发给工分票，统计一天生产成绩，写好统计汇报；与队长、队委在田头研究好明天生产计划，并当场向社员公布，使每个社员知道明天自己要做的事情。晚上社员休息，他就把每个社员一天的工分和食堂一天吃的粮食累计起来，把各种账算清，记载入册。到十天结算、公布账目的时候，如逢雨天休息，就利用雨天结算；天晴就在晚上结算。
    点滴归公　增加集体收入
    张仁丰参加劳动以后，更进一步体会到物质财富来之不易。因此，他在工作中处处关心集体利益，一点一滴的为队里增加收入，节省开支。去年夏天，有一天他从公社开会回来，发现秧田干了，他赶到家里，扛起锹就走。母亲说：“饭都盛好了，还到那儿去？”他回头给母亲说清楚，便赶到田头，花了两个多小时，将山涧里的水打坝拦起来，直到水漫到田里，他才高高兴兴地回家吃饭。秋天，这四亩多田收到一千七百多斤稻子。稻子收后，社员打了四交，但是，张仁丰发现打的仍不干净，又动员大家复打了一次，结果又多打了四十多斤粮食。去年秋季队里牛草不够，冬天牛又无房子住，男劳力都上了水库，仅剩二十多个妇女在家，他便积极向队长建议，要带妇女上山砍草。在他的带头影响下，二十多个妇女花了三天半的时间，就砍回来四万多斤山草。用这些草盖了三间牛房，修补了十五间破屋，还弥补了牛草的不足。
    在用钱方面，他也是能节省就节省。食堂里的水桶、锅盖、扫帚等用具以及大车、犁耙等大型农具，都是由他亲手修制，光这一方面，去年一年他就为队里节省了一百多元。
    是社员最放心的人
    平时，张仁丰在工作上公正无私、克己奉公。去年秋天，他的母亲在田里拾回几斤抛撒的豆子和花生，他知道后，立即对母亲进行说服教育，将豆子、花生拿出来交给了队里。今年4月份，他母亲生病了，有人劝他将公款拿几元给母亲治病，以后再还。他坚决地说：“我不能动用公款。”有一次，队长叫他带两个社员到离家十几里的涧溪镇去卖桃子。临走，队长交给他几斤粮票，告诉他就在镇上吃顿饭。他们把桃子卖完已是下午，两个社员肚子饿了，提议去饭馆吃饭，张仁丰对他们说：“粮和钱都是社员们辛辛苦苦挣来的，到饭馆吃饭要花钱花粮票，还是熬一下，回去吃吧！”两个社员被他这种克己为公的行为感动了，二话没说，挑着担子回了家。正由于他办事公平、克己奉公，因此，社员对他非常信任，都称呼他是最放心的人。
    张仁丰同志对于部分社员不识字的情况很关心，他除了积极帮助社员写信、看信外，一有空，就读报给他们听。为了帮助部分社员学文化，他每次下田带着一块黑板，一本扫盲书，利用休息时间在田头上课；晚上回家，也尽量抽出一定时间，将青年男女组织在一起上课。对有奶孩子的妇女和老年人，把字送上门教，经过他几年来的努力，全队有十七个人已经脱掉了文盲帽子。
    张仁丰，解放前家庭生活贫苦，解放后生活就一天一天的好起来。在党的教育培养下，他渐渐地懂得了要想过幸福美满的日子，就得要搞好集体生产，办好大家的事情。就凭着这样一颗火热的心，忠诚于党，热爱社会主义事业，五年如一日，忘我的劳动着、工作着。
