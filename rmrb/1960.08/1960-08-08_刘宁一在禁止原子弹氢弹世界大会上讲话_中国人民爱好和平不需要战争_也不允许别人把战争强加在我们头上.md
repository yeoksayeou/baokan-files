Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 7th: Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation attending the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, delivered a speech at the conference on the 6th.

He said: The World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, initiated by the Japanese people, has been held five times, and each conference has made significant contributions to promoting the struggle of the world's people to ban nuclear weapons, oppose wars of aggression, and defend world peace. This conference, in which the Japanese people combine the struggle against nuclear weapons with the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, is very correct. Because as long as this treaty of arms expansion and war preparations exists, there is no way to prohibit nuclear weapons in Japan and Asia. He believes that with the efforts of the Japanese people and the support of representatives from various countries, the Sixth World Conference will surely achieve greater success.

He said that in recent years, the heroic Japanese people have launched wave after wave of struggles against the U.S.-Japan military alliance and against U.S. military bases. Through these struggles, the Japanese people have more clearly recognized that U.S. imperialism is their most ferocious enemy. He said: Now the Japanese people have found a good way to unite all forces that can be united, launch a nationwide mass movement, and fight to demand that the American aggressors withdraw from Japan, and they are full of confidence in victory. The welcoming peace parade of tens of thousands of people on the 5th once again powerfully demonstrates that the future of the Japanese people is bright and full of hope. The Chinese people firmly believe that a brave nation like Japan, which loves independence and freedom, will never be controlled by foreign countries for long, and they will surely be able to defeat the enemy and establish an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral country.

He pointed out that the reason why the Chinese people strongly oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is to protect themselves and to protect peace in Asia and the world. It is precisely because of this that the Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the Japanese people as their own struggle, and the victory of the Japanese people as their own victory. This foundation of mutual support and common struggle is the common interest of the two peoples in defending peace and security. As Mr. Inejiro Asanuma said well, "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people."

Liu Ningyi pointed out that the struggle of the Japanese people is part of the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism, and it has received the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world. The struggles of the broad masses of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are influencing, supporting, and encouraging each other, forming a powerful torrent against imperialism, making imperialism overwhelmed and exhausted.

He said that the Chinese people have always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and are even more willing to promote the normalization of relations between the two countries with its close neighbor, Japan, based on the Five Principles. The Chinese people have always supported the Japanese people's desire to take the path of independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that as long as Japan does not take the road of militarism, China and Japan can coexist peacefully for a long time. The Chinese people and government have always maintained that as long as the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is abolished and the revival of Japanese militarism is stopped, the clauses of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance relating to the prevention of the resurgence of Japanese militarism can be cancelled. The Chinese people and government have also repeatedly advocated that countries in Asia and along the Pacific coast, including the United States, jointly sign a non-aggression peace pact to make this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

He said that the Chinese people do not need war, nor will they allow others to impose war on us. We are willing to strive to defend world peace and to achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. During the speech of head of delegation Liu Ningyi, thunderous applause resounded throughout the venue.

    刘宁一在禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会上讲话
    中国人民爱好和平不需要战争
    也不允许别人把战争强加在我们头上
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：出席第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的中国代表团团长刘宁一6日在大会上作了发言。
    他说：由日本人民发起的禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会已经开过五次了，历届大会都对推动世界人民禁止核武器、反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平的斗争，作出了重大的贡献。这次大会，日本人民把反对核武器和反对日美军事同盟条约斗争结合起来进行，这是非常正确的。因为，只要这个扩军备战的条约一天存在，日本和亚洲的核武器就无从禁止。他相信，第六届世界大会在日本人民努力下和各国代表支持下，一定能获得更大的成就。
    他说，近年来，英勇的日本人民掀起了一浪高一浪的反对日美军事同盟、反对美国军事基地的斗争。通过这些斗争，日本人民更加认清美帝国主义是他们的最凶恶的敌人。他说：现在日本人民已经找到了团结一切可以团结的力量、发动全民性群众运动、为要求美国侵略者撤出日本而斗争的好办法，并且对胜利充满着信心。5日的欢迎和平大游行万人大会，再一次有力地说明日本人民的前途是光明的、是充满希望的。中国人民坚信，像日本这样一个勇敢的、热爱独立和自由的民族，绝不会长期被外国所控制，他们一定能够战胜敌人，建立一个独立、民主、和平、中立的国家。
    他指出，中国人民所以强烈反对日美军事同盟条约，是从保卫自己和保卫亚洲和世界和平出发。正是因为这样，中国人民一向把日本人民的斗争看成是自己的斗争，把日本人民的胜利看成是自己的胜利，这种相互支持、共同斗争的基础是两国人民为保卫和平与安全的共同利益。浅沼稻次郎先生讲得好，“美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人”。
    刘宁一指出，日本人民的斗争是全世界人民反对帝国主义的斗争的一部分，它得到了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的支持。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的广大人民群众的斗争，都在彼此影响，互相支持，互相鼓舞，形成一股强大的反对帝国主义的洪流，使帝国主义顾此失彼，穷于应付。
    他说，中国人民一贯主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，对于自己的近邻日本，更是愿意根据五项原则，来促使两国关系正常化。中国人民一向支持日本人民走独立、和平、民主、中立道路的愿望。中国政府曾经一再表示，只要日本不走军国主义的道路，中日两国是可以长期和平共处的。中国人民和政府历来主张，只要废除日美军事同盟条约，停止复活日本军国主义，那么，中苏友好同盟互助条约有关防止日本军国主义再起的条款就可以取消。中国人民和政府还一再主张，亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内，共同签订一项互不侵犯的和平公约，使这一地区成为无核武器区。
    他说，中国人民不需要战争，也不允许别人把战争强加在我们头上。我们愿意为保卫世界和平，为实现不同社会制度国家间的和平共处而奋斗。在刘宁一团长讲话的过程中，会场上不断响起雷鸣般的掌声。
