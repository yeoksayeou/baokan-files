Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from Leopoldville: Congolese Minister of Information Kashamura announced at a press conference in Leopoldville today that the Congolese government has ordered the Belgian ambassador to the Congo, Vanden Bossche, to leave the Congo before noon on the 9th, and has ordered the closure of the Belgian embassy and all consulates in the Congo.

　　Kashamura also announced at the press conference the Congolese Cabinet's decision to declare a state of emergency throughout the Congo from the 9th. Kashamura said that the Congolese government took this measure in order to "prepare to deal with possible military intervention and repel enemy aggression." The news said that Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, who had just returned home, participated in the cabinet meeting that made this decision.

　　It was announced that the Congolese government will immediately send a plane to Belgium to bring back Congolese studying there.

　　As previously reported, after Belgium sent troops to invade the Congo, the Congolese government notified the Belgian government, announcing that the Congo officially severed diplomatic relations with Belgium from July 14th, and demanded that Vanden Bossche leave the Congo immediately. However, the Belgian ambassador ignored the Congolese government's orders and remained in the Congo, continuing various conspiracies.

    刚果内阁宣布全国处于紧急状态
    并勒令比利时大使立即离境
    新华社9日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果新闻部长卡沙谬拉今天在利奥波德维尔举行记者招待会宣布，刚果政府限令比利时驻刚果大使范登博斯什必须在9日中午前离开刚果，并下令关闭比利时在刚果的大使馆和所有领事馆。
    卡沙谬拉在记者招待会上还宣布了刚果内阁关于刚果全国从9日起处于紧急状态的决定。卡沙谬拉说，刚果政府所以采取这个措施，是为了“准备对付可能的军事干涉和击退敌人的侵略”。消息说，刚刚回国的刚果总理卢蒙巴参加了作出这个决定的内阁会议。
    据宣布，刚果政府将立即派一架飞机去比利时撤回在那里学习的刚果人。
    前已报道，自从比利时派兵侵略刚果后，刚果政府曾经照会比利时政府，宣布自7月14日起刚果正式同比利时断绝外交关系，并要求范登博斯什立即离开刚果。但是，这位比利时大使不顾刚果政府的命令一直赖在刚果未走，并继续各种阴谋活动。
