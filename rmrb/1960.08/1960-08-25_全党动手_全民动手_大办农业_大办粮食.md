    A brand-new situation is emerging on China's agricultural front. Many provinces and autonomous regions have millions of laborers reinforcing the front lines of agricultural production. The actions of all sectors of the economy, led by the industrial sector, to support agriculture have reached an unprecedented scale; large numbers of staff and leading cadres from leadership organs at all levels in various regions have gone deep into the front lines of agricultural production, and the leading organs of many counties and communes have moved their offices to the grassroots units of the communes to effectively lead agricultural production. A new upsurge of the whole party and the whole people vigorously developing agriculture and grain production is taking shape.
    Faced with such a great situation, we cannot help but recall the scenes of the vast rural areas of our country in the autumn and winter of 1957. At that time, the Chinese peasants, united and striving forward on the socialist road, inspired and guided by the "Forty Articles" of the National Agricultural Development Program re-proposed by the Party Central Committee, launched a magnificent upsurge of production and construction, vigorously building water conservancy projects and accumulating fertilizer, paving the way and laying the foundation for the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Grasping early and grasping tightly is an important experience of the Great Leap Forward.
    Now that the hot summer has passed and early autumn has arrived, it is the season for showing great talent on the agricultural front. The main tasks at present are to strengthen the management of autumn fields and do a good job in autumn harvesting, striving to obtain more grain this autumn; and actively prepare for autumn plowing and autumn planting, striving to obtain more grain next summer.
    The experience of the Great Leap Forward in the past two years has further proven that autumn occupies a particularly important position in the entire agricultural production. Autumn harvest crops account for the largest proportion of the entire agricultural production. For the whole country, the majority of the annual grain output is harvested in autumn; in some areas with one crop a year, all the grain is harvested in autumn. The vast majority of industrial raw material crops are harvested in autumn. How the autumn harvest goes has a decisive impact on the completion of the annual agricultural production plan. The turn of summer to autumn is the peak growing season and seed-setting season for major autumn crops, and it is also a period of changeable weather conditions and frequent natural disasters. How much effort is put in and how well it is done in field management and disaster resistance during this period has a particularly large impact on the harvest. Whether it is to promote crop growth and development and produce more seeds (such as topdressing, irrigation, and artificial pollination), or to control unfavorable factors that are harmful to crop yield increase (such as weeding, pest control, drainage, and preventing lodging), the most important thing is to seize the opportunity. Missing the opportunity, sometimes even delaying by half a day, will lose more possibilities for increasing production, or lose the possibility of reducing losses. In order to seize the opportunity, take the initiative, and harvest as much grain and other agricultural products as possible, we must put the greatest effort into autumn field management and autumn harvesting. This is the primary task of the whole party and the whole people vigorously developing agriculture and grain production.
    Autumn is not only an important season for striving for more harvest in the current year, but also an important season for striving for more harvest in the next year. The summer harvest crops sown in autumn occupy an important position in the annual agricultural production. In terms of grain crops, the area of autumn-sown and summer-harvested crops often accounts for a quarter of the total area of ​​annual grain crops. In terms of oil crops, the area of ​​autumn-sown and summer-harvested crops often accounts for a third of the total area of ​​annual oil crops. Since the summer harvest is the first harvest of each year, it plays a particularly important role in promoting annual production and arranging people's lives. In the Yellow River basin, summer harvest crops have always accounted for a large proportion of the annual harvest; in many areas of the south, it is also necessary to expand the proportion of summer harvest crops in order to avoid certain natural disasters and more evenly arrange the labor force and people's lives in all seasons of the year. "Good autumn depends on management, good wheat depends on planting." The success or failure of winter wheat and other overwintering crops is particularly closely related to autumn plowing and autumn sowing. Expanding the autumn and winter sowing area as much as possible and improving the quality of autumn plowing and autumn sowing as much as possible is the second important task of the whole party and the whole people vigorously developing agriculture and grain production.
    Launching a mass movement to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production has even more far-reaching significance. The experience of socialist construction in our country further proves that agriculture is the foundation for the development of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. The growth rate of agriculture in our country has a significant impact on the entire national economy and the development speed of industry. From 1950 to 1959, the total agricultural output value of our country increased by approximately 10.4% annually on average, and the total industrial output value increased by approximately 29.2% annually. Generally speaking, if the growth rate of the annual agricultural output value exceeds the average speed, the growth of the annual industrial output value in the following year will also exceed the average speed. For example, in 1952, the total agricultural output value increased by 15.3%; in 1953, the total industrial output value increased by 30.2%. Conversely, if the growth rate of the annual agricultural output value is much lower than the average speed, the growth of the annual industrial output value in the following year will also be much lower than the average speed. For example, in 1954, the total agricultural output value only increased by 3.3% due to disasters; in 1955, the total industrial output value only increased by 5.6%, especially the output value of consumer goods, which also decreased by 0.03%. The extraordinary leap forward in agriculture in 1958 promoted the extraordinary leap forward in industry and the extraordinary leap forward in the entire national economy in the same year. Agriculture is the source of people's basic living materials, the raw material base for light industry, and also the broadest market for light and heavy industry. To accelerate the realization of industrialization, it is necessary to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. If the agricultural harvest is good, other things will be easier to handle.
    In the past ten years, agriculture in our country has gradually increased, especially in 1958 and 1959, the growth rate was even faster. In ten years, the agricultural output value in our country has more than doubled, of which grain has more than doubled. This fully proves the superiority of the socialist system, and proves the correctness and viability of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. However, the original level of agriculture in our country was very backward, and since liberation, with the development of national construction, the demand for agricultural products has increased rapidly. Although our country is an agricultural power with a long history and a large population, before liberation, the level of agricultural development had always been very low. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, although the consumption level of the broad masses of working people was very low, it was still necessary to import large quantities of grain and cotton every year. In the ten years since liberation, this situation has undergone tremendous changes; however, the level of agricultural development is still not high enough, and with the leap forward in the entire economic construction and the improvement of people's living standards, the demand for grain, non-staple food, and industrial raw materials is increasing. Taking the demand for grain as an example, because all those who can participate in labor generally participate in labor, and workers and peasants are actively working throughout the year, the amount of food has greatly increased; after the establishment of the People's Commune and public canteens, the rations of the original poor peasants and lower-middle peasants have been increased to the level of middle peasants; in the past three years, the population of urban industrial and mining areas has increased by about 20 million; industrial grain consumption has also increased greatly; the agricultural capital construction team is very large, and the number of people participating in water conservancy construction last winter and this spring reached more than 70 million at the most, and their rations are more than those of ordinary peasants; all of these have greatly increased grain consumption. The demand for cotton is also the same. At present, in the vast rural areas and even remote mountainous areas, the situation of being unclothed and several generations wearing a piece of ragged clothing has completely disappeared. The clothing of urban and rural working people has been greatly improved. Although cotton production has more than tripled in the past ten years, it is still not abundant. Due to the relatively backward modern technical conditions in agricultural production in our country, it is still unable to get rid of the influence of natural conditions. In years with more natural disasters, such as last year when more than 500 million mu of land were affected by disasters, and this year when more than 600 million mu of land were affected by disasters, this situation is even more obvious. In order to adapt to the needs of the continued leap forward in the national economy, in order to try to make up for the losses of continuous agricultural disasters, and in order to try to increase reserves to adapt to the situation that agricultural production cannot be very stable under the current conditions, it is necessary to put agricultural production, especially grain production, in the primary position.
    These situations show that putting agriculture in the primary position and mobilizing the whole party and the whole people to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production is not an expedient measure, but a strategic policy for a fairly long period in the process of socialist construction in our country. In the Great Leap Forward in our country, both industry and agriculture have made great progress, and the strength of industry to support agriculture and the strength of agriculture itself have become more abundant. With the consolidation and healthy development of the People's Commune, agricultural development has a broader road. Under such circumstances, it is both necessary and possible to further play the basic role of agriculture, and it is both necessary and possible to mobilize industry to support agriculture with greater strength. Now the Party Central Committee especially emphasizes the implementation of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, which precisely correctly reflects the objective laws and requirements of economic development.
    Developing agriculture is a glorious cause, and agricultural labor is glorious labor. Agricultural labor is not only a major cause for building a new socialist countryside, but also an extremely important part of the entire socialist construction cause. In recent years, more and more cadres have gone to the countryside and mountains, and have been struggling hard on the front lines of agricultural production; more and more young students have settled in the countryside and become a new type of cultured agricultural worker in our country. They have set an example of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production with their own actions, and have made significant contributions to the motherland and to socialism. Now, in the great situation of further developing agriculture, all rural cadres and commune members must work harder to shoulder the main task of accelerating agricultural development; cadres and masses in all walks of life must more actively, more actively, and more effectively support agriculture; the whole party and the whole people must shoulder the important responsibility of laying a better foundation for accelerating the development of the national economy. At present, the situation on the entire agricultural front is very favorable, and it is possible to strive to harvest as much grain as possible this autumn and to strive for a summer harvest next year that exceeds any previous year. Let us hold aloft the three red banners of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, the the People's Commune, the whole party mobilizes, the entire people mobilizes, vigorously develop agriculture, vigorously develop grain production! Let us all comrades of the Party and the people of the whole country continue to exert their efforts, work hard, develop agriculture faster, increase grain production more, arrange people's lives better, and ensure the continued leap forward of the national economy better and more comprehensively.

    全党动手　全民动手　大办农业　大办粮食
    我国农业战线正出现一个崭新的形势。许多省和自治区，都有数以百万计的劳动力增强农业生产前线。以工业部门为主的各行各业支援农业的行动，达到了前所未有的规模；各地各级领导机关的大批工作人员和领导干部，纷纷深入农业生产第一线，许多县和公社的领导机关把办公室搬到了公社的基层单位，切实地领导农业生产。全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的新高潮正在形成。
    面对着这样的大好形势，我们不由得想起1957年秋冬两季我国广大农村的景象。那时候，在社会主义大道上团结一致奋勇前进的中国农民，在党中央重新提出的全国农业发展纲要“四十条”的鼓舞和指引下，掀起了波澜壮阔的生产建设高潮，大兴水利，大积肥料，为1958年的大跃进开辟了道路，奠定了基础。抓得早、抓得紧，这是大跃进的一条重要经验。
    现在，炎夏已过，秋初已临，正是农业战线上大显身手的时节。当前的主要任务是加强秋田管理和做好秋收工作，争取今年秋季拿到更多的粮食；积极准备秋耕秋种，争取明年夏季拿到更多的粮食。
    过去两年大跃进的经验进一步证明：秋季在整个农业生产中占有特别重要的地位。秋收作物在整个农业生产中占有最大的比重。就全国来说，粮食全年产量的大部分是在秋季收获；在某些一年一熟的地区，粮食全部都在秋季收获。工业原料作物，绝大部分都在秋季收获。秋季收成如何，对于完成全年农业生产计划有决定性的影响。夏秋之交，正是大秋作物的盛长时期和结籽时期，同时又是气象情况多变、自然灾害频繁的时期。这个时期在田间管理上和抗灾斗争中用劲大小和做得好坏，对于收成的关系特别大。无论是促进作物生长发育、多结籽粒（如追肥、灌溉、辅助授粉等等）方面，无论是控制有害于作物增产的不利因素（如除草、灭虫、排涝、防倒伏等等）方面，最要紧的是不失时机。错过时机，有时甚至迟延一天半天，都会失去更多增产的可能性，或者失去减少损失的可能性。欲求不失时机，掌握主动，尽可能多收一些粮食和其他农产品，就必须把最大的力量用在秋田管理和秋收方面。这是当前全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的首要任务。
    秋季不仅是争取当年更多收成的重要季节，也是争取明年更多收成的重要季节。秋季播种的下一年的夏收作物在全年的农业生产中占有重要的地位。就粮食作物来说，秋播夏收作物的面积经常占全年粮食作物总面积的四分之一。就油料作物来说，秋播夏收作物的面积经常占全年油料作物总面积的三分之一。由于夏收是每年的第一次收获，在促进全年生产方面和安排人民生活方面都有特别重要的作用。在黄河流域，夏收作物从来就在全年收获中占着较大的比重；在南方的许多地区，为了避开某些自然灾害和更均衡地安排全年各季的劳动力和人民生活，也有必要扩大夏收作物的比重。“秋好在管，麦好在种”。冬小麦等越冬作物的收成好坏，同秋耕秋播工作的关系特别密切。尽可能扩大秋冬播种面积，尽可能提高秋耕秋播质量，这是当前全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的第二项重要任务。
    发动一个大办农业、大办粮食的全民运动，还有更加深远的意义。我国社会主义建设的经验进一步证明：农业是国民经济发展的基础，粮食是基础的基础。我国农业增长的速度，对整个国民经济、对工业的发展速度，有着重大的影响。1950年到1959年，我国农业总产值平均每年递增约10.4％，工业总产值每年递增约29.2％。一般地说，农业年产值的增长速度超过平均速度的，次年工业年产值的增长也就超过平均速度。如1952年，农业总产值增长15.3％；1953年，工业总产值增长30.2％。相反，农业年产值的增长低于平均速度很多的，次年工业年产值的增长也就低于平均速度很多。如1954年，农业因为受灾总产值只增长3.3％；1955年，工业总产值就只增长5.6％，特别是生活资料的产值，还降低0.03％。1958年农业特大跃进，当年就促进了工业特大跃进和整个国民经济的特大跃进。农业是人们的基本生活资料的来源，是轻工业的原料基地，又是轻工业和重工业的最广大的市场。要加速实现工业化，就必须大办农业、大办粮食。农业收成好了，别的事情也就好办了。
    在过去十年中，我国农业是逐步增长的，特别是1958年和1959年，增长的速度更快。十年中我国农业产值增长了一倍多，其中粮食增长了一倍多。这充分证明了社会主义制度的优越性，证明了党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的正确性和生命力。但是，我国原来的农业水平很落后，而解放以来，随着国家建设事业的发展，对农产品的需要却增长很快。我们的国家虽然是一个历史悠久人口众多的农业大国，但是在解放前，农业的发展水平一直是很低的。国民党反动派统治时期，虽然广大劳动人民的消费水平很低，但每年还要进口大批粮食、棉花。解放十年来，这种状况已经有了极大的改变；但是农业发展的水平仍然还不够高，而随着整个经济建设的跃进和人民生活水平的提高，对粮食、副食品和工业原料的需要量却越来越大。就拿对粮食的需要来说，由于凡是能参加劳动的人一般都参加了劳动，工人和农民全年都在积极地劳动，食量大为增加；人民公社和公共食堂成立以后，原来的贫农、下中农的口粮已提高到中农的水平；近三年来城市工矿区人口增加了两千万左右；工业用粮也增加很大；农业基本建设队伍很大，去冬今春参加水利建设的人数最多的时候达到了七千多万人，他们的口粮比一般农民多；所有这些，都使粮食的消耗量大大增加。对棉花的需要也是如此。目前在广大农村以至偏僻的山区，过去那种衣不蔽体和祖孙几代穿一件破衣服的情况已经完全绝迹。城市和农村劳动人民的衣著有了很大的改善。十年来棉花产量虽然增长了三倍多，但仍然不富裕。我国的农业生产由于现代技术条件还比较落后，还不能摆脱自然条件的影响。在自然灾害较多的年份，例如去年就有五亿多亩地受灾，今年又有六亿多亩地受灾，这种情况就更加明显。为了适应国民经济持续跃进的需要，为了力求弥补农业连续受灾的损失，为了力求增加储备以便适应农业生产在目前条件下还不能十分稳定的情况，必须把农业生产、特别是粮食生产放在首要地位。
    这些情况说明，把农业放在首要地位，动员全党全民大办农业、大办粮食，不是什么权宜之计，而是我国社会主义建设过程中一个相当长的时期内的战略方针。我国在大跃进中，工业和农业都有了巨大的进展，工业支援农业的力量和农业本身的力量都更雄厚了。随着人民公社的巩固和健康的发展，农业的发展有了更宽阔的道路。在这样的形势下，既有必要也有可能进一步发挥农业的基础作用，既有必要也有可能发动工业以更大的力量支援农业。现在党中央特别强调贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针，恰恰是正确地反映了经济发展的客观规律和要求。
    发展农业是光荣的事业，农业劳动是光荣的劳动。农业劳动不但是建设社会主义新农村的重大事业，而且是整个社会主义建设事业的极其重要的部分。近几年来，已经有越来越多的干部下乡上山，一直在农业生产前线艰苦奋斗；越来越多的青年学生到农村安家立业，成为我国新型的有文化的农业劳动者。他们用自己的行动树立了大办农业、大办粮食的榜样，为祖国、为社会主义作出了重大的贡献。现在，在进一步发展农业的大好形势下，全体农村干部和社员群众要更加努力地担负起加速发展农业的主要任务；各行各业的干部和群众要更主动更积极更有效地支援农业；全党全民要担负起为加速发展国民经济打下更好的基础的重大责任。目前整个农业战线形势十分有利，争取今年秋季尽量多打粮食和争取明年夏收超过过去任何一年，都是大有可为的。让我们高举党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的三面红旗，全党动手，全民动手，大办农业，大办粮食！让我们全党同志和全国人民，继续鼓足干劲，艰苦奋斗，更快地发展农业，更多地增产粮食，把人民生活安排得更好，保证国民经济更好更全面地继续跃进。
