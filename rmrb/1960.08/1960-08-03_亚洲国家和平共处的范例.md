The Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee, under the close cooperation and direct guidance of the two governments, held its second meeting in Beijing, following the first meeting in Rangoon. In a short period of just over a month, and with only a few days of meetings, significant and complex issues have been successfully resolved, and progress has been made in the work of the surveying teams and investigation groups of both sides. Thus, the preparatory work for the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty will be completed by the end of September this year. The Chinese people express warm congratulations on the rich achievements of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee.

According to the tasks stipulated in the Sino-Burmese Boundary Agreement signed in January this year, and according to the suggestion put forward by Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, which was warmly welcomed by our Premier Zhou Enlai, to sign the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty during Prime Minister U Nu's visit to China in October this year, the work of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee is heavy and urgent. However, due to the continued adherence by the leaders of the two governments and the delegations of both sides to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and the promotion of mutual understanding, mutual concession, and friendly cooperation, the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee has reached mutually satisfactory agreements on major issues without hindrance. This agreement defines the scope of the Pianma, Gulang, and Kangfang areas to be returned to China, defines the scope of the Panhung and Panlao tribal areas to be assigned to China in exchange for China's Meng-Mao Triangle, fairly and reasonably handles the issue of villages straddling the "1941 Line," and lays the foundation for the drafting of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. We are very pleased to see that with the final settlement of the historical boundary issues between the two countries, a permanent boundary of peace and friendship has been established between our two Asian neighbors, and the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries will enter a new stage.

The smooth resolution of the Sino-Burmese boundary issue is a contribution made by the joint efforts of the Chinese government and successive Burmese governments over many years. In December 1954, when Burmese Prime Minister U Nu visited China, the prime ministers of the two countries determined that it was necessary to resolve the boundary issue through normal diplomatic channels at an appropriate time in a spirit of friendship. In November 1956, when U Nu, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, visited China, the two governments reached an understanding: Chinese troops would withdraw from the area west of the "1941 Line" and Burmese troops would withdraw from the Pianma, Gulang, and Kangfang areas. This temporary arrangement not only guaranteed tranquility on the border between the two countries but also facilitated the resolution of the boundary issue. In December of the same year, when our Premier Zhou Enlai visited Burma, he had friendly discussions with the then Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe, further clarifying the views of the two countries and bringing the boundary issue closer to a mutually satisfactory resolution. In January this year, when former Burmese Prime Minister Ne Win visited China, the two countries conducted friendly consultations on a comprehensive and thorough resolution of the boundary issue and finally concluded the Agreement on the Boundary Issue between China and Burma. At the same time, the prime ministers of the two countries also signed the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between China and Burma. The Sino-Burmese Boundary Agreement was enthusiastically supported by Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, and the two governments exchanged instruments of ratification on May 14. Now the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee is rapidly completing its glorious task.

The boundary issues between China and Burma, like the boundary issues that exist between China and many countries in South Asia, are historical issues. However, no matter how complex the boundary issues are, because the leaders of China and Burma, in the process of seeking to resolve the boundary issues between the two countries through negotiations, have always taken the common aspirations of the two peoples, the fundamental interests of the two peoples, and Asian peace as their top priority, adopted an attitude of friendly consultation based on both historical background and current actual conditions, followed the Five Principles, and exercised mutual understanding and mutual concession, seeking common ground and gradually creating conditions for a comprehensive solution, our boundary issues have finally been comprehensively and permanently resolved, and the peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between the two countries have been further consolidated and developed. As our Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out: "The development of friendly relations between China and Burma proves that countries with different social systems can achieve peaceful coexistence as long as both sides have a sincere desire for peace and friendship and make continuous efforts to overcome the difficulties that already exist and will arise. The friendly relations between China and Burma have set a good example of peaceful coexistence for countries with different social systems in the world." Brigadier Aung Gyi, head of the Burmese delegation to the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee, said: "I suggest that peace-loving countries in the world, if there are problems between them, can resolve their problems and achieve smooth results by adopting the principles of tolerance, sincerity, mutual understanding, and mutual concession, just as we have done." The resolution of the Sino-Burmese boundary issue fully proves this point.

China has long been subjected to imperialist aggression. On the boundary issue, China is a victim. Now, our territory of Taiwan is still occupied by U.S. imperialism, and China is still subject to the hostility and encirclement of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization pieced together by U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this aggression and encirclement and have always advocated and striven to achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. To this end, our government advocates that all countries on the Asian and Pacific coasts, including the United States, sign a treaty of non-aggression and peace and build the entire region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. China has initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with India and Burma, participated in the creation of the "Bandung Spirit," and has always unswervingly abided by this principle and spirit, making unremitting efforts to promote friendly cooperation with countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Now, this effort by the Chinese people has gained increasingly broad understanding and cooperation from countries and peoples, and has continuously expanded and strengthened mutual friendship and unity. Recently, China not only signed the Boundary Agreement with Burma and concluded the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression, but also signed the Boundary Agreement and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship with Nepal. In April this year, our Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to friendly neighboring countries in South Asia further promoted the friendship between China and the peoples of these neighboring countries. The new development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Asian countries has powerfully struck at the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary forces of certain Asian countries who vainly attempt to undermine the friendly relations between China and the peoples of Asian countries, making themselves more isolated in front of the people of Asia and Africa.

The peoples of China and Burma are not only friendly neighbors but also close "Pauk-Phaw" (relatives). The establishment of a peaceful and friendly boundary between the two countries and the conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between the two countries mark the further consolidation and development of the profound friendship between our two peoples. This is not only in line with the fundamental interests of the two peoples but also a major contribution to promoting the friendly unity of Asian and African countries and consolidating peace in Asia and the world. We fully believe and wish the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee a successful outcome.

    亚洲国家和平共处的范例
    中缅边界联合委员会在两国政府的密切合作和直接指导下，继在仰光举行的第一次会议之后，在北京举行了第二次会议。两次会议只经过短短的一个多月，而开会时间不过几天，就已顺利地解决了不少重要而复杂的问题，双方勘察队和调查组的工作也取得了进展。这样，两国签订边界条约的准备工作，将在今年9月底完成。中国人民对中缅边界联合委员会取得的这一丰富成果，表示热烈的祝贺。
    根据今年1月中缅两国签订的边界问题协定规定的任务，根据缅甸吴努总理提出、得到我国周恩来总理热烈欢迎的在吴努总理于今年10月间访问我国时签订中缅边界条约的建议，中缅边界联合委员会的工作是繁重而紧迫的。但是，由于两国政府领导人和双方代表团继续根据和平共处五项原则，发扬互谅互让和友好合作的精神，中缅边界联合委员会已毫无阻碍地就重大问题达成了双方满意的协议。这个协议，确定了归还中国的片马、古浪和岗房地区的范围，确定了划归中国以交换中国的猛卯三角地的班洪和班老部落辖区的范围，公平合理地处理了“1941年线”上骑线村寨的问题，并为起草中缅边界条约的工作奠定了基础。我们十分高兴地看到，随着两国历史上遗留下来的边界问题的最后解决，我们亚洲两个邻邦之间有了一条和平友好的永久性边界，两国友好合作关系将进入一个新的阶段。
    中缅边界问题的顺利解决，是我国政府和缅甸历届政府领导人多年来共同努力作出的贡献。在1954年12月，缅甸总理吴努访问我国时，两国总理就确定，有必要根据友好精神，在适当时机内，通过正常的外交途径，解决边界问题。1956年11月，缅甸联邦反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努访问我国时，两国政府取得谅解：中国军队撤出“1941年线”以西地区和缅甸军队撤出片马、古浪和岗房地区，这个暂时性的安排不仅一直保证了两国边境的安宁，而且有利于边界问题的解决。同年12月，我国周恩来总理访问缅甸时，又同当时的缅甸总理吴巴瑞进行了友好讨论，进一步澄清了两国的观点，使边界问题更接近于双方满意的解决。到了今年1月，缅甸前总理奈温访问我国时，两国就全面、彻底地解决边界问题进行了友好协商，终于缔结了关于中缅两国边界问题的协定，同时两国总理还签订了关于中缅友好和互不侵犯条约。中缅边界协定得到了缅甸总理吴努的热烈支持，5月14日两国政府交换了批准书。现在中缅边界联合委员会正迅速地完成着自己的光荣任务。
    中缅两国的边界问题，像我国同南亚许多国家间存在的边界问题一样，都是历史上遗留下来的问题。但是，不管边界问题是怎样复杂，由于中缅两国领导人在谋求解决两国边界问题的谈判过程中，始终根据两国人民的共同愿望，以两国人民和亚洲和平的根本利益为重，采取既考虑历史背景又考虑当前实际情况，遵循五项原则，互谅互让地进行友好协商的态度，寻找共同点，逐步创造全面解决的条件，使得我们两国边界问题终于能够得到全面的、一劳永逸的解决，使两国的和平共处、友好合作关系得到进一步的巩固和发展。正如我国周恩来总理所指出的：“中缅两国友好关系的发展证明，不同社会制度的国家只要双方都具有对于和平友好的真诚愿望，并且进行不断的努力，就可以克服已经存在的和将要发生的困难，实现和平共处。中缅两国的友好关系为世界上不同社会制度国家的和平共处树立一个良好的典范。”中缅边界联合委员会缅甸代表团团长昂季准将说：“我建议世界爱好和平的国家，如果他们之间存在问题的话，他们就可以像我们采取的这样的办法，采取宽容、诚恳、互谅互让的原则，他们的问题就可以解决，获得顺利的结果。”中缅两国边界问题的解决，完全证明了这一点。
    我国长期来遭到帝国主义的侵略，在边界问题上，中国是一个受害国，现在我国领土台湾仍然被美帝国主义所侵占，我国还受到美帝国主义拚凑的东南亚条约组织的敌视和包围。我国人民坚决反对这种侵略和包围，始终主张和争取实现不同社会制度的国家之间的和平共处。为此，我国政府主张亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内，签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约，把这整个地区建成为没有核武器的地区。我国已同印度、缅甸倡导了和平共处五项原则，参加了“万隆精神”的缔造，并始终不渝地遵守这个原则和精神，为促进同亚非和拉丁美洲各国的友好合作关系作着不懈的努力。现在，我国人民这个努力，得到了日益广泛的国家和人民的了解和合作，不断扩大和加强了相互的友好和团结。最近我国不仅同缅甸签订了边界问题的协定，缔结了友好和互不侵犯条约，而且同尼泊尔签订了边界问题的协定和和平友好条约。今年4月间，我国周恩来总理对南亚友好邻邦的访问，更加促进了我国和这些邻邦人民间的友谊。我国同亚洲国家友好合作关系的新的发展，有力地打击了美帝国主义和某些亚洲国家的反动势力妄想破坏中国同亚洲各国人民友好关系的阴谋，使他们自己在亚非人民面前更加陷于孤立的处境。
    中缅两国人民不仅是友好的邻居，而且是亲密的“胞波”。两国和平友好边界的确立，两国友好和互不侵犯条约的缔结，标志着我们两国人民的深厚友谊的进一步巩固和发展。这不但符合两国人民的根本利益，而且对促进亚非国家的友好团结，巩固亚洲和世界和平，也是一个重大的贡献。我们完全相信、而且预祝中缅边界联合委员会最后将取得美满的结果。
