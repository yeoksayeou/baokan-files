Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from Leopoldville: A Congolese government statement broadcast by the Leopoldville radio station on the 16th stated that the actions of the "United Nations forces" in the Congo were "troublesome."

The radio station said that the Congolese government has requested an immediate meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the situation in the Congo.

It is reported that Congolese armed police began a large-scale search in Leopoldville before dawn on the 16th to hunt down Belgian spies who were conducting conspiracies under the guise of "United Nations identity." This search was conducted after Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba accused four hundred Belgian paratroopers of hiding in the Congolese capital under United Nations protection.

Congolese police searched the United Nations headquarters, hotels, and residences in Leopoldville, checking documents. Police also stopped jeeps carrying "UN troops" on the streets, as well as people wearing UN armbands, demanding that they show identification. Some "UN personnel" and colonialists without identification were detained. Sources say that hundreds of African workers on their way to work expressed joy as those arrested were put on trucks and taken to police headquarters.

A French News Agency dispatch from Leopoldville on the 16th stated: "UN forces" from Sweden and Ireland are suspected of being allies of Belgium. The message also stated that currently, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's "prestige" has reached its "lowest point" in Leopoldville.

On the other hand, the "UN forces" under U.S. manipulation are continuing to actively conduct operations in the Congo. The United Nations High Military Command in the Congo announced in a communiqué on the 16th that the United Nations will establish an "Eastern Command" responsible for Katanga and Kivu provinces in Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province, and that Irish Colonel Byrne will serve as the commander of this region. The communiqué also announced that the UN's troop strength in Katanga Province would be increased to four thousand.

Sources say that a mixed team of Swedish troops from the "UN forces" and police from the Katanga Province puppet government of Tshombe left Elisabethville on the 16th for a six-day "patrol" throughout Katanga Province.

The message also stated that a "UN force" of two hundred and twenty men arrived in Jadotville, one of the areas of Katanga Province where the struggle against colonialism is high, at dawn on the 16th, and immediately implemented a curfew in the city. This "UN force" stipulated that a curfew be imposed on African residents from 6:00 PM and on colonialists from 11:00 PM.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from Leopoldville: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba announced at a press conference on the 16th that the Congolese government had decided to implement special military control in the Congo for a period of six months beginning on the night of the 16th. It is reported that this new measure has been jointly announced by Congolese President Kasavubu and Prime Minister Lumumba.

At the press conference, Lumumba once again accused UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld of disregarding the will of the Congolese government. He said, "Our government does not exist for the Secretary-General."

Lumumba demanded that the Swedish troops participating in the "UN forces" immediately withdraw from the Congo. He said that the Swedish troops in the "UN forces" "did very bad things." He accused the Swedish troops of sheltering Belgian army officers and blatantly defying the authority of the Congolese government.

Lumumba's press conference was held after a cabinet meeting. It is reported that the cabinet meeting passed a series of new measures.

Lumumba also said: "If within fifteen days, we do not recover our gold and property that is currently frozen, we will have to consider confiscating Belgian industries in the Congo."

At the same time, Lumumba said that the Congolese government intends to establish people's courts to replace the courts where Belgians serve as judges.

Lumumba also confirmed an earlier news item. The message said that a team of Belgian paratroopers was driven out of the Congolese capital by the Congolese army under the personal supervision of the Congolese armed forces commander Lundula and his chief of staff Mobutu. Lumumba said at the press conference, "We expelled a forty-man Belgian paratrooper squad because they continued to hide shamelessly at N'Djili Airport under the gracious protection of the UN forces and the Belgian Sabena Airlines." He said that the Congolese army also arrested the director of this Belgian airline. Lumumba said, "Lundula and I saw this action and can prove the malice of the UN forces in attempting to obstruct the actions of the Congolese police."

It is reported that UN officials privately admitted that some Belgians were using the blue armbands of the "UN forces" in an attempt to infiltrate the Congo and carry out conspiracies.

Lumumba also said that Pierre Machar, the Belgian embassy counselor in the Congo, had been arrested on the 16th. He said that this counselor was hiding in a hotel in Leopoldville, but according to the Congolese government's deportation order, he should have left the Congo eight days ago.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from Leopoldville: After Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba informed UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld that "the Congolese government and people have lost confidence in you," the UN Secretary-General, who has been running around for the United States' conspiracy to control the Congo, left the Congolese capital Leopoldville for New York on the evening of the 15th.

Hammarskjöld had cabled for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the situation in the Congo that evening.

Hammarskjöld left the Congo that evening in a rage. Before leaving, he retaliated in a letter to Prime Minister Lumumba, dismissing Lumumba's repeated condemnations of the work of the United Nations and the United Nations Secretary-General as "erroneous accusations." He even rejected two requests from the Congo: First, that the Congolese delegation travel with him on the same plane to New York to present the Congolese government's views on Hammarskjöld's work to the Security Council; Second, that Hammarskjöld postpone his departure by twenty-four hours so that the Congelese delegation could arrive in New York in time to attend the meeting.

The Congolese government is preparing to send a delegation, including Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga, to New York to attend the emergency meeting of the Security Council proposed by Hammarskjöld to explain the Congolese government's position.

    不许殖民主义者假联合国之名在刚果捣乱
    刚果政府决定实行特别军事管制
    利奥波德维尔武装警察搜捕在联合国军庇护下的比利时间谍
    新华社17日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果首都利奥波德维尔电台16日广播刚果政府的一项声明说，“联合国部队”在刚果的行动是“捣乱”。
    这家电台说，刚果政府已经要求立即召开联合国安全理事会会议，讨论刚果局势。
    据报道，刚果武装警察从16日黎明前在利奥波德维尔开始了一次大规模搜捕在“联合国身份”的伪装下进行阴谋活动的比利时间谍。这次搜捕是在刚果总理卢蒙巴指责有四百名比利时伞兵在联合国庇护之下躲藏在刚果首都之后进行的。
    刚果警察搜查了在利奥波德维尔的联合国总部、旅馆和住宅，检查证件。警察在街上还拦住载着“联合国军”的吉普车以及佩带联合国臂章的人，要他们出示身份证。有些没有证件的“联合国人员”和殖民者被拘留。消息说，被捕者在被赶上卡车开到警察总部去时，正去上工的数百名非洲工人表示高兴。
    法新社16日从利奥波德维尔发出的一条消息说：“联合国军”中的瑞典和爱尔兰部队被怀疑地认为是比利时的同盟者。这条消息还说，目前，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的“威信”在利奥波德维尔达到了“最低点”。
    另一方面，美国操纵下的“联合国军”正在刚果继续积极进行活动。在刚果的联合国最高军事司令部16日在一项公报中宣布，联合国将在刚果加丹加省省会伊利沙伯维尔设立一个负责加丹加和基伍两省的“东部司令部”，爱尔兰的伯恩上校将担任这个地区的司令官。公报还宣布，要把联合国在加丹加省的兵力增加到四千人。
    消息说，“联合国部队”的瑞典军队和加丹加省冲伯傀儡政府的警察组成的一个混合队16日离开伊利沙伯维尔去加丹加省各地进行六天的“巡查”。
    消息还说，一支二百二十名的“联合国部队”16日拂晓赶到加丹加省反对殖民主义斗争的高涨地区之一贾多特维尔，并且立即在这个城市实行宵禁。这支“联合国部队”规定：从十八时起对非洲居民实行宵禁，二十三时起对殖民者实行宵禁。
    据新华社17日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴16日在记者招待会上宣布，刚果政府决定从16日夜晚开始在刚果实行为期六个月的特别军事管制。据报道，这项新措施已由刚果总统卡萨武布和总理卢蒙巴联名宣布。
    卢蒙巴在记者招待会上再一次指责联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德无视刚果政府的意志。他说，“我们的政府对于秘书长来说是不存在的”。
    卢蒙巴要求参加“联合国军”的瑞典部队立即撤出刚果。他说，“联合国军”中的瑞典部队“做了很坏的事”。他指责瑞典部队掩护比利时陆军军官，公然蔑视刚果政府的权力。
    卢蒙巴的记者招待会是在内阁会议以后举行的。据报道，内阁会议通过了一系列的新措施。
    卢蒙巴还说：“如果在十五天内，我们没有收复现在被冻结的我们的黄金和财产，我们将不得不考虑没收在刚果的比利时产业。”
    同时，卢蒙巴说，刚果政府打算设立人民法庭来代替比利时人担任法官的法庭。
    卢蒙巴还证实早些时候发表的一则消息。消息说，一队比利时伞兵在刚果武装部队司令伦杜拉和他的参谋长蒙博托的亲自监督下被刚果军队赶出刚果首都。卢蒙巴在记者招待会上说，“我们把四十名比利时的伞兵小队驱逐出境，因为他们在联合国部队和比利时萨贝那航空公司殷勤的庇护下继续无耻地藏在恩季利机场。”他说，刚果军队还逮捕了这个比利时航空公司的主任。卢蒙巴说，“我和伦杜拉看到这个行动，并且能够证明企图妨碍刚果警察的行动的联合国部队的恶意。”
    据报道，联合国官员私下承认，有些比利时人使用“联合国军”的蓝色臂章，企图混在刚果进行阴谋活动。
    卢蒙巴还说，比利时驻刚果使馆参赞皮埃尔·马沙尔已经在16日被逮捕。他说，这个参赞藏在利奥波德维尔的一个旅馆里，而他应当根据刚果政府的驱逐令在八天前离开刚果。
    据新华社16日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：在刚果总理卢蒙巴通知联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德说“刚果政府和人民已对你失去信任”之后，这个为美国控制刚果的阴谋奔走的联合国秘书长在15日晚上离开刚果首都利奥波德维尔前往纽约。
    哈马舍尔德在当天晚上已经打电报要求联合国安全理事会召开紧急会议讨论刚果局势。
    哈马舍尔德在当天晚上怒气冲冲离开了刚果。他临走前，在给卢蒙巴总理的信件中反唇相讥，把卢蒙巴对联合国和联合国秘书长的工作多次提出的谴责说成是“错误指责”。他甚至还拒绝了刚果的两项要求：一、刚果代表团和他乘同一架飞机去纽约向安理会陈述刚果政府对哈马舍尔德的工作的看法；二、哈马舍尔德推迟二十四小时动身，以便刚果代表团能及时赶到纽约出席会议。
    刚果政府准备派遣包括副总理基赞加在内的一个代表团前往纽约出席哈马舍尔德建议召开的安全理事会紧急会议，说明刚果政府的态度。
