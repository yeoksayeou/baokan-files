Several Regions in the Congo: Patriotic Soldiers Persist in Struggle, Refusing to Lay Down Arms to UN Forces. Congolese Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga Exposes the UN's Protection of Aggressors in Front of Hammarskjöld. Guinean President Touré Condemns Imperialists for Using the UN to Sabotage Congolese Independence.

Xinhua News Agency, July 31st: Many Congolese soldiers are persisting in their struggle, refusing to disarm to the UN forces. According to Belgian news agencies, in Bukavu, the capital of Congo's Kivu province, hundreds of patriotic Congolese soldiers who oppose armed aggression and interference by imperialist countries refuse to lay down their arms to the UN forces.

Hundreds of Congolese soldiers who had been disarmed and transported from the Belgian military-occupied Katanga province to Bukavu also refused to demobilize and be sent back home.

The northern part of Kivu province remains under the control of the Congolese army. UN forces have been successively arriving in Goma, a border city in Kivu province, since the 28th. Many Congolese soldiers there refuse to disarm. Congolese army patrols also guard the highway from Goma to Lutchuru, searching for the vehicles of colonialists.

Leopoldville News: Congolese Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga, in front of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld at a reception on the evening of the 30th, exposed the UN's protection of Belgian aggressors and condemned UN forces for inexplicably disarming the Congolese army.

Gizenga said that the UN "only asks Belgian aggressors to re-concentrate in certain areas of the Congo that they dare to call Belgian bases."

The Congolese Deputy Prime Minister said, "We are the victims of aggression, yet we are being disarmed in an organized and systematic manner." He then pointed out, "The Belgians, who are entrenched in our country like conquerors, maintain their weapons and continue to have the power to kill." He said that this policy enables the Belgians to conquer the disarmed, systematically plunder the Congo, and organize conspiracies.

Gizenga also accused the UN of "allowing separatist activities to consolidate its position in Katanga province" and "allowing the Belgians to act there as if in their conquered territory." Hammarskjöld was greatly embarrassed and attempted to defend the US-controlled UN's position with words about how the UN organization could not implement an unjust peace. However, Agence France-Presse reported that most observers at the reception believed that Hammarskjöld's words caused "definite disappointment" among the Congolese present.

News indicates that the UN's actions are becoming increasingly exposed to the Congolese people. Hammarskjöld and UN Under-Secretary-General, the American Bunch, attended the Congolese cabinet meeting again on the 30th. According to reports, Hammarskjöld's so-called "plan to solve the Congo problem" was opposed by some Congolese ministers. Agence France-Presse from Leopoldville reported that Congolese public opinion has begun to doubt the necessity of the UN in the Congo. One Congolese official angrily said, "The UN is a liar; it has fooled us."

The Congolese Abako Party issued a resolution in Leopoldville, the capital of the Congo, on the 25th, demanding the immediate departure of the Belgian invading army from the Congo.

Xinhua News Agency, August 1st: Leopoldville news: In Leopoldville, the capital of the Congo, strictly controlled by UN forces under the command of the American Bunch, the local people's opposition to colonialism is running high. At the telecommunications center occupied by UN forces, Congolese staff held a strike to protest the return of twelve Belgian "technicians" to rule them. The strikers shouted slogans such as: "No Belgian colonialists!" "No (Belgian) paratroopers!"

In addition, African workers at the Congo Transportation Bureau also held a rally to warn Belgian colonialists not to come to control the port of Leopoldville again.

In Elisabethville, the capital of Congo's Katanga province, heavily occupied by Belgian troops, local people held demonstrations and rallies on July 30th and 31st, despite the province's authorities' bans and the Belgian invading army's suppression, to protest the traitorous actions of Katanga Province Governor Tshombe, an agent of foreign monopoly capital, in splitting the Congo's territory, as well as the Belgian army's occupation of Katanga. News reports that the Belgian military headquarters there, in order to step up the suppression of the people's patriotic struggle in the province, announced the cancellation of all Belgian officials' vacations on the evening of July 30th, and the police there were also prepared to deal with the "situation".

In Kivu province, Congolese soldiers and civilians are still fighting back against provocations by Belgian colonialists in various places.

In addition, according to news from Ruanda-Urundi, a Belgian "trust territory", about three hundred prisoners in the Kigali prison there recently rioted to protest the brutal rule of the Belgian colonialists. They clashed with Belgian colonial troops who came to suppress them.

At the same time, UN Under-Secretary-General, the American Bunch, stepped up the dispatch of UN forces to occupy cities and disarm the Congolese army in various parts of Equateur Province. According to reports, an Irish battalion participating in the UN forces has arrived in Kindu, Kasongo, Goma, and Bukavu in Equateur Province to deploy, forbidding Congolese soldiers from carrying weapons out, and even Congolese police are not allowed to patrol with guns. In Stanleyville, the capital of Orientale Province, a UN troop commander stationed in Orientale Province revealed on the 30th that the UN forces there restricted the freedom of movement of Congolese soldiers, prohibiting them from leaving the barracks. He said that Congolese soldiers could only go out without carrying weapons. He also admitted that UN forces had arrested some Congolese soldiers there.

According to news from Matadi in Bas-Congo, after the UN forces "took over" the port of Matadi from the Congolese army defending the port, a Belgian cargo ship called "Mobeka" sailed into the port again on July 27th.

Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, July 31st: According to Guinean radio today, Guinean President Sékou Touré issued another statement on the Congolese situation, condemning imperialists for conspiring to replace the legitimate authority of the Congolese government. Touré said: Imperialists are already using UN forces as a tool to undermine the independence of the Congo. Touré also pointed out that the purpose of the imperialist countries' aggression against the Congo is not only to separate Katanga province from the Congo, but also to continue the cruel exploitation of the Congolese people and the Congolese economy, and to place African countries in a subordinate position to them politically, economically, and socially.

Touré concluded by saying: Given the threats facing Africa, the Guinean government has decided to take all necessary measures to crush the imperialists' conspiracy to restore colonial rule and plunder African wealth.

    不许帝国主义利用联合国名义侵略
    刚果刚果不少地区爱国士兵坚持斗争拒绝向联合国军放下武器  刚果副总理基赞加当着哈马舍尔德揭露联合国包庇侵略者  几内亚总统杜尔谴责帝国主义者利用联合国破坏刚果独立
    据新华社31日讯　许多刚果士兵坚持斗争，拒绝向联合国军缴械。据比利时通讯社透露，在刚果基伍省省会布卡武，数以百计的反对帝国主义国家的武装侵略和干涉的刚果爱国士兵拒绝向联合国军放下武器。
    数百名被解除武装后从比利时军事占领下的加丹加省开到布卡武的刚果士兵，也拒绝复员和被遣返回家。
    基伍省北部仍然在刚果军队控制下。联合国部队从28日起陆续开到基伍省的边境城市果马。那里的许多的刚果士兵拒绝解除武装。刚果军队的巡逻士兵还守卫着从果马通往北方的卢楚胡鲁的公路，他们搜索殖民者的汽车。
    利奥波德维尔消息：刚果副总理基赞加30日晚上在一次酒会上当着联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的面，揭露联合国包庇比利时侵略者，并谴责联合国军队无理解除刚果军队的武装。
    基赞加说，联合国“只是要求比利时侵略者在他们竟敢称为比利时基地的刚果某些地区重新集中。”
    这位刚果副总理说，我们是侵略的牺牲者，而我们却被有组织和有步骤地解除武装。他接着指出，“像征服者那样盘踞在我国的比利时人却保持着他们的武装和继续拥有杀人的权力。”他说，这种政策使比利时人能够对被解除武装的人进行征伐、有组织地掠夺刚果和组织阴谋。
    基赞加还指责说，“联合国军让分裂（刚果）活动在加丹加省巩固它的阵地”，并且“让比利时人在那里像在他们征服了的领土上那样行事。”哈马舍尔德大为窘迫，企图用什么联合国组织不能实施不公正的和平这样的话来为受美国操纵的联合国的立场辩解。然而，法新社消息指出，参加酒会的大多数观察家认为，哈马舍尔德的话在到会的刚果人中，引起了“肯定的失望”。
    消息表明，联合国的所作所为愈来愈被刚果人识破。哈马舍尔德和联合国副秘书长、美国人本奇30日再次出席了刚果内阁会议。据消息说，哈马舍尔德提出的所谓“解决刚果问题”的计划遭到刚果一些部长的反对。法新社从利奥波德维尔发出的消息说，刚果舆论开始怀疑联合国在刚果的必要性。一位刚果官员愤怒地说，“联合国是一个骗子，它愚弄了我们。”
    刚果阿巴科党25日曾在刚果首都利奥波德维尔发表了一项决议，要求比利时侵略军队立即离开刚果。
    新华社1日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：在美国人本奇指挥下的联合国军严格控制的刚果首都利奥波德维尔，当地人民反对殖民主义者的情绪高涨。在联合国军占领的电讯中心，刚果职员曾举行了罢工，抗议十二名比利时“技术人员”重新回来统治他们。罢工者高呼：“不要比利时殖民者！”“不要（比利时）伞兵！”等口号。
    另外，刚果运输局的非洲职工也举行集会，警告比利时殖民者不得再来控制利奥波德维尔港口。
    在比利时重兵占领的刚果加丹加省省会伊利沙伯维尔，当地人民不顾该省当局的禁令和比利时侵略军的镇压，在7月30日和31日连续举行示威集会，抗议加丹加省省长、外国垄断资本代理人冲伯分裂刚果领土的卖国行为以及比利时军队对加丹加的侵占。消息说，那里的比利时军事司令部为了加紧镇压这个省的人民的爱国斗争，在7月30日晚上宣布取消全体比利时官员的休假，那里的警察也都准备好应付“局势”。
    在基伍省，刚果军民仍在各地反击比利时殖民者的挑衅。
    另外，据来自比利时“托管地”卢安达—乌隆迪的消息说，在那里的基加利监狱，约三百名被监禁者最近举行暴动，抗议比利时殖民者的残暴统治。他们曾同前往镇压的比利时殖民军发生冲突。
    在这同时，联合国副秘书长、美国人本奇加紧派遣联合国军去赤道省各地占领城市和解除刚果军队的武装。消息说，参加联合国军的爱尔兰的一个营已经到达赤道省的金杜、卡松果、果马和布卡武等地布防，不准刚果士兵携带武器外出，甚至连刚果警察也不准带着枪进行巡逻。在东方省省会斯坦利维尔，据一个驻在东方省的联合国部队司令30日透露，那里的联合国军竟限制刚果士兵的行动自由，禁止他们走出兵营。他说，刚果士兵只有在不携带武器的情况下才能外出。他还承认，联合国军在那里逮捕了一些刚果士兵。
    据来自下刚果马塔迪的消息说，在联合国军从坚守港口的刚果军队手中“接管”了马塔迪港以后，一艘叫做“莫贝卡号”的比利时货船又在7月27日驶入这座港口。
    新华社科纳克里31日电　据几内亚电台今天报道，几内亚总统塞古·杜尔就刚果局势再次发表声明，斥责帝国主义者阴谋取代刚果政府的合法权力。杜尔说：帝国主义者已经在利用联合国军队作为工具来破坏刚果的独立。杜尔同时指出，帝国主义国家侵略刚果，其目的不仅在于使加丹加省脱离刚果，而且还在于继续对刚果人民和刚果经济进行残酷的剥削，并从政治、经济和社会方面把非洲各国置于从属于它们的地位。
    杜尔最后说：鉴于非洲面临着这种威胁，几内亚政府决定采取一切必要的措施，来粉碎帝国主义者试图恢复殖民统治和掠夺非洲财富的阴谋。
