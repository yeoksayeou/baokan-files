More Schools Should Run Paper Mills
    Li Yuxiu

Schools use a lot of paper, and many schools have the conditions to run paper mills. Therefore, it is worthwhile to encourage schools to run paper mills.

China's paper production has increased substantially year after year, but it still cannot keep up with the rapid growth in demand. Due to the tremendous development of cultural and educational undertakings, the amount of paper used in all aspects, especially in schools, has increased unprecedentedly. According to materials from Shanxi Province, the amount of paper used for textbooks alone this year has increased by more than 70% compared to last year. Therefore, relying solely on the increased production of existing paper mills cannot fully meet the needs. This requires further tapping the potential for increased paper production from all aspects, and schools running paper mills is a good way to develop paper production more quickly. The experience of Jieshiu Middle School in Shanxi Province and other schools in starting paper mills using indigenous methods on a large scale can be promoted in other regions with suitable conditions, adapting to local conditions.

Schools have various favorable conditions for running paper mills. First of all, many schools have already established various factories in the past, and have accumulated a lot of experience and trained a considerable number of technical personnel in the process of running factories. Some of the factories already run by schools are more difficult and complicated than running a paper mill, whether in terms of technology, investment, etc. Since these schools were able to start from scratch in the past and set up factories, it should be easier for them to run paper mills now. Secondly, a considerable number of schools across the country are distributed in small and medium-sized cities and rural areas, where a large amount of inexhaustible raw materials for papermaking can be found, such as sorghum stalks, wheat stalks, cotton stalks, rice straw, reeds, bamboo, rags, shoe soles, waste hemp, waste paper, etc. Schools can run paper mills and use various raw materials locally without competing with large-scale industries for raw materials. Therefore, although there will still be some difficulties for schools to run paper mills, such as equipment problems and certain technical problems, these can be completely resolved as long as the favorable conditions are fully utilized and teachers, staff, and students are mobilized to offer suggestions.

When schools start running paper mills, they must adhere to the principle of building factories simply and using indigenous methods. At present, we should use indigenous methods as much as possible, start production first, and then gradually improve, gradually moving from indigenous to modern. This experience has proven to be effective in running other enterprises, and it has also proven to be effective in schools running paper mills.

Running paper mills in schools can not only supply the paper needs of the school, so as to achieve self-sufficiency with a surplus, but also help to closely combine the school's teaching, scientific research, and productive labor, and cultivate talents with both theoretical knowledge and practical production knowledge. We imagine that if most schools with suitable conditions across the country ran paper mills like Jieshiu and other middle schools, not only would the paper supply situation be greatly improved, but also the development of cultural and educational undertakings would be further promoted. It is hoped that the Party organizations of schools at all levels will pay attention to this work, so that more schools will run paper mills!

### 要更多的学校办造纸厂

    要更多的学校办造纸厂
    李玉秀
    学校是用纸较多的单位，而许多学校也有条件办造纸厂。因此，由学校办纸厂，是值得提倡的一件事。
    我国的纸张生产连年来都有大幅度地增长，但是仍然赶不上迅速增长的需要。由于文化教育事业的巨大发展，各方面的用纸数量、特别是学校的用纸数量空前增加，根据山西省的材料，今年仅课本用纸，就比去年增加了70％以上。因此，仅仅依靠现有造纸工厂的增产，不能完全满足需要。这就需要进一步从各方面挖掘增产纸张的潜力，而学校办纸厂，正是更快地发展纸张生产的一个好办法。山西省介休中学等一批学校土法上马、大办造纸厂的经验，在其它地区有条件的学校，都可以因地制宜加以推广。
    学校办纸厂有各种有利条件。首先是许多学校在过去已办起了各种各样的工厂，并且在办厂过程中积累了不少经验，培养出相当数量的技术人材。有些学校已办的工厂，不论从技术、投资等各方面说来，比办一个造纸厂要困难的多，复杂的多。这些学校过去既然能够平地起家，办起了工厂，现在来办造纸厂，应当说是比较容易一些的。其次，全国有相当多的学校分布在中小城镇和农村，在那里，可以找到大量取之不尽、用之不竭的造纸原料，诸如高粱秆、麦秆、棉秆、稻草、芦苇、竹子、破布、鞋底、废麻、废纸，等等。学校办了纸厂，可以在不与大工业争原料的原则下，就地取材，利用各种原料。因此学校办纸厂，尽管还会有一些困难，比方设备问题以及某些技术问题等，但是只要充分利用有利条件，发动教职员、学生献计献策，是完全可以解决的。
    学校开始兴办造纸厂的时候，必须坚持因陋就简、土法上马的建厂原则。当前，能用土办法的，就尽量使用土办法，首先开工生产，然后逐步提高，逐步由土到洋。这条经验在办其他企业当中，被证明是行之有效的，同样在学校办纸厂中，也已被证明是行之有效的。
    学校办纸厂不仅可以供应学校用纸需要，以至做到自给有余，而且有利于使学校的教学、科学研究、生产劳动紧密地结合起来，培养出既有理论知识，又有生产实践知识的人材。我们设想，如果全国大部分有条件的学校都像介休等中学那样办了造纸厂，不仅纸张供应的情况会大大改善，而且也会更进一步促进文化教育事业的发展。希望各级学校党组织重视这一工作，使更多的学校都办起造纸厂来！
