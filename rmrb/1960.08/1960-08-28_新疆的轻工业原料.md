　　Xinjiang has extremely rich light industrial resources. There are cotton fields with silver flowers everywhere, boundless wild hemp, sheep like clouds, mulberry trees in forests, high-yielding sugar beets, and pool salt, mineral salt, and beach salt are everywhere. Oases surrounded by flowing water are full of fruit tree gardens. From textiles to food, from papermaking to leather making, from light chemical industry to daily necessities, abundant raw materials can be found in Xinjiang.
　　In Xinjiang, nature has arranged the most ideal conditions for planting cotton: year-round lack of clouds and little rain provide cotton with sufficient sunshine, and all artificial free-flowing irrigation frees cotton from drought. The Tarim Basin, the southern part of the Junggar Basin, and the Turpan Basin are now large-scale cotton planting areas. Xinjiang's cotton planting area has reached six times that of the early days of liberation. Xinjiang cotton is famous throughout the country for its high yield, white color, long fiber, and strong tensile strength. The frost-free period in the Turpan Basin and the Tarim Basin is as long as 180 days or more. In the past, the long-staple cotton that China relied on for imports can also grow and mature in large quantities here.
　　Raw materials for wool spinning, silk spinning, and flax spinning are also abundant. Xinjiang has cultivated China's first fine wool sheep breed—Xinjiang sheep. The high-grade woolen fabrics spun from this wool have also reached the world's advanced level. Xinjiang also has more than 100,000 camels and more than 4 million goats. Camel hair and goat cashmere are also raw materials for high-grade wool spinning. There are more than 8.3 million mu of wild hemp—Apocynum—growing on Xinjiang's wasteland. Apocynum fiber can be blended with silk, wool, and cotton to make fine clothing materials such as valitin and serge. Sericulture and silk reeling have a long history in Xinjiang.
　　In the sugar industry, the sugar content of sugar beets is generally around 15%, but the sugar content of sugar beets planted in Xinjiang's large areas of saline-alkali land is as high as 20%.
　　Including more than 20 million heads of livestock such as cattle, sheep, camels, and donkeys, as well as wild animals such as wolves, leopards, foxes, otters, muskrats, snow sweepers, and gray rats that haunt the primitive forests of the Tianshan, Altai, and Kunlun Mountains, they are Xinjiang's strong material foundation for developing the meat food industry and the leather industry.
　　Xinjiang has more than 900,000 dairy cows. Calculated at a minimum daily milk production of one kilogram, the annual milk production is more than 300,000 tons. In the past, pastoral areas relied on milk for their livelihoods due to food shortages. Now, with the self-sufficiency of grain in pastoral areas, there are conditions to develop a large dairy product industry. Melon fields, grapes, and orchards are everywhere in Xinjiang. The area of ​​fruit tree gardening is more than one million mu, of which the grape area accounts for more than half of the country. The apples of Yili, the grapes of Turpan, the fragrant pears of Korla, the ginkgo of Kuqa, and the figs of Artush are all the best among fruits. In addition, there are more than sixty uninhabited valleys in the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, with all kinds of mountain fruits growing all over the mountains, with an area of ​​more than 200,000 mu. It is a good raw material for making fruit puree, fruit wine, fruit preserves, and fruit acid.
　　Xinjiang has 300,000 square kilometers of vast and fertile natural pasture, and more than 160 million mu of reclaimable wasteland and abundant water sources. As long as wasteland is actively reclaimed, the planting area of ​​cotton and sugar beet can be greatly expanded. Xinjiang's seedless white raisins have been sold to many foreign countries. This type of grape can still grow in the Gobi gravel area. And this kind of land is many times larger than wasteland.
　　Agricultural and animal husbandry products are only one aspect of light industrial resources. Xinjiang also has thousands of kinds of wild plants for developing light industry, including starch plants, alkali-making plants, spice plants, insecticidal plants, dye plants, oil plants, rubber plants, and medicinal plants. Reed is a high-grade papermaking raw material. The annual output of wild reeds in Xinjiang is estimated to be more than 10 million tons. Reeds are not the only papermaking raw material in Xinjiang. The vast primitive forests, a large number of straws, cotton stalks, cotton linters, and Imperata cylindrica can all be used to produce various types of paper in large quantities.
　　Table salt, which is needed by the modern light chemical industry, can be found everywhere in Xinjiang. There are both pool salt, mineral salt and beach salt, and production is not restricted by seasons. In the ancient dried-up lake bottom in the Jinghe area, as long as the thin layer of soil on the top is dug open, there is an inexhaustible supply of transparent crystalline salt underneath. There are several huge salt mountains in the Aksu area of ​​southern Xinjiang, and the mineral salt produced is as transparent as crystal. Xinjiang's raw materials for the ceramic industry and glass industry are also very rich and have good development prospects.
　　These provide favorable conditions for the development of light industry. If multiple operations are combined and utilized comprehensively, the potential of Xinjiang's light industry is even more endless.

### 新疆的轻工业原料

    新疆的轻工业原料
    新疆有着极为丰富的轻工业资源。那银花遍地的棉田，一望无际的野麻，羊群如云，桑树成林，甜菜高产，池盐、矿盐、滩盐到处可见，流水环绕着的绿洲，到处是果木花园。从纺织到食品，从造纸到制革，从轻化工到日用生活必需品，都能够在新疆找到它丰富的原料。
    在新疆，大自然给种植棉花安排了最为理想的条件：终年缺云少雨，为棉花提供了充分的日照条件，全部的人工自流灌溉，又使棉花免于干旱。塔里木盆地、准噶尔盆地南面和吐鲁番盆地，今天都是大面积植棉的地区。新疆棉花播种面积已经达到解放初期的六倍。新疆棉花以产量高、色泽洁白、纤维长和拉力强著名全国。吐鲁番盆地和塔里木盆地无霜期长达一百八十天以上，过去我国依靠进口的长绒棉，也能够大量生长成熟。
    毛纺、丝纺和麻纺的原料也同样丰富。新疆培育出了我国第一个细毛羊品种——新疆羊，这种羊毛所纺织的高级毛料呢料，也达到了世界先进水平。新疆还有十万多峰骆驼和四百多万只山羊。驼绒与山羊绒也是高级毛纺的原料。新疆荒地上生长着八百三十多万亩野麻——罗布麻。罗布麻纤维可与丝、毛、棉混纺成凡立丁、哔叽等高级衣料。养蚕缫丝，在新疆有悠久的历史。
    制糖工业中，甜菜含糖量一般在15％左右，新疆有大面积的盐碱地，种植的甜菜含糖量却高达20％左右。
    包括着牛、羊、骆驼、驴等两千多万头家畜，以及出没在天山、阿尔泰山、昆仑山原始森林中的狼、豹、狐、獭、麝鼠、扫雪、灰鼠等野生动物，是新疆发展肉类食品工业和皮革工业雄厚的物质基础。
    新疆有乳牛九十多万头，以最低日产奶一公斤计算，一年产奶三十多万吨。过去牧业区因为缺粮，牧民生活以乳为生，现在随着牧区粮食自给，已经有条件发展大量乳制品工业。新疆到处都有瓜田、葡萄和果园。果树园艺面积一百多万亩。其中葡萄面积占全国的多半。伊犁的苹果、吐鲁番的葡萄、库尔勒的香梨、库车的银杏、阿图什的无花果都是水果中的佳品。此外，伊犁哈萨克自治州有六十多条荒无人烟的山谷，满山谷中长满了各种山果，面积有二十万多亩，它是制作果浆、果酒、果脯、果酸的好原料。
    新疆有着三十万平方公里辽阔丰美的天然牧草场，有着一亿六千多万亩可垦荒地和丰富的水源。只要积极开垦荒地，就可以大大扩大棉花和甜菜等的种植面积。新疆的无核白葡萄干已行销国外许多国家，这种葡萄在戈壁砾石地带，依然可以生长。而这种土地比起荒地来，又不知大了多少倍。
    农牧业产品还只是轻工业资源的一方面。新疆还有着发展轻工业的几千种野生植物，包括了淀粉植物、制碱植物、香料植物、杀虫植物、染料植物、油料植物、橡胶植物以及药用植物等等。芦苇是高级的造纸原料。新疆的野生芦苇年产量估计有一千多万吨。新疆的造纸原料不只芦苇一种。绵延千里的原始森林，大量禾秆、棉秆、棉花短绒以及芨芨草，都可以大量生产各种各样的纸张。
    现代轻化工业所需要的食盐在新疆到处都可以找到。既有池盐，又有矿盐和滩盐，生产不受季节限制。在精河一带古代干涸了的湖底，只要刨开上面薄薄的土层，下面就是取之不尽的透明的结晶盐。南疆阿克苏专区有几座巨大的盐山，所产矿盐透明如同水晶。新疆的陶瓷工业、玻璃工业原料也很丰富，有着很好的发展前途。
    这些，都为轻工业的发展提供了有利条件，如果加上多种经营综合利用，新疆轻工业的潜力更是无穷无尽。
