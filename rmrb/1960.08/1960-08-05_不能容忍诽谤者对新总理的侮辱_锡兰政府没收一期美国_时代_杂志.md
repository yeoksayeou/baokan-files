Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, August 3rd: The Ceylon Government Information Office issued a communique on the evening of August 2nd, announcing that the Ceylon government has decided to prohibit the import of the August 1st issue of the American "Time" magazine and confiscate this issue, because it contained an article slandering Ceylon's new Prime Minister, Mrs. Bandaranaike.

This article distorted Ceylon's recent general election.

It claimed that the Ceylon Freedom Party's victory in this election was due to a "crying widow," openly insulted Mrs. Bandaranaike, and attacked her for "lacking even a basic concept of governing."

This article has also aroused widespread indignation among the people of Ceylon.

    不能容忍诽谤者对新总理的侮辱
    锡兰政府没收一期美国“时代”杂志
    新华社科伦坡3日电　锡兰政府新闻处2日晚间发表公报宣布，锡兰政府已经决定禁止8月1日出版的一期美国“时代”杂志进口，并且没收这期美国杂志，因为它刊载了诽谤锡兰新任总理班达拉奈克夫人的文章。
    这篇文章歪曲了锡兰最近举行的大选。
    它说什么锡兰自由党在这次大选中所以获胜是由于“哭泣的寡妇”，公然侮辱班达拉奈克夫人，并且攻击她“对管理政府缺乏起码的概念”。
    这篇文章也引起了锡兰人民的普遍愤慨。
