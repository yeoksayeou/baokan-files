Going Deep to "Mentor Apprentices", Concentrating Efforts to "Find Teachers"
Baoqing Helps Cadres Continuously Improve Leadership Skills

(Our dispatch) Heilongjiang's Baoqing County, in promoting the "three-seven system" leadership method, implements the approach of going deep to "mentor apprentices" and concentrating efforts to "find teachers," helping cadres to continuously deepen their work and promoting current production.

In May of this year, after the Baoqing County Party Committee studied the "two-five system" leadership method of Wuqiao County, and combining it with the characteristics of this county – many mountains, dispersed residences, and inconvenient travel for cadres to go to the countryside – the county decided to promote the "three-seven system" leadership method throughout the county. After the implementation of this system, the County Party Committee's First Secretary Liu Zemin and fourteen County Party Committee members, with the exception of one secretary who remained in the county to direct operations, were all assigned to different areas and took responsibility for specific communes, going deep into the front lines of production. Before the promotion of the "three-seven system," only more than two hundred cadres went deep into the front lines; after the promotion of the "three-seven system," this increased to more than eight hundred people, strengthening leadership over production. After arriving at the front lines, most cadres were able to eat, live, work, and consult with commune members, promptly discovering and solving problems in production, making their work deeper, more meticulous, and more practical. However, it was also discovered that a few cadres had not truly gone deep and could not promptly discover and solve problems in production. In addition, some newly employed cadres did not understand how to follow the mass line, and did not know how to both participate in production and lead production. The Baoqing County Party Committee believes that cadres going to the front lines of production is only the first step in improving work; the next step is to help the cadres who have gone down to truly go deep, discover problems, solve problems, and help the grassroots lead production well. In order to solve this problem, the County Party Committee decided that, in the process of promoting the "three-seven system" leadership method, all departments directly under the county and all communes should adopt the approach of going deep to "mentor apprentices" and concentrating efforts to "find teachers" to help cadres truly go deep. All departments directly under the county and the Party Committees of each commune conscientiously implemented the County Party Committee's decision and created the methods of "teaching, doing, and helping" to "mentor apprentices" when going deep, and "speaking, establishing, and learning" to "find teachers" when concentrating efforts. The so-called teaching, doing, and helping when going deep means that during the seven days that cadres go deep, newly employed cadres and cadres with mass work experience are assigned to work in a district or team, and in actual work, they are taught working methods, shown how it's done, and helped to improve their working methods. The so-called speaking, establishing, and learning when concentrating efforts means that during the three days of concentrating efforts at the county or commune level, each cadre speaks about their successful leadership methods in their work in the countryside, sets up models of deep work following the mass line, and studies Chairman Mao's works to improve their level of theoretical understanding. The Qingshan Commune Party Committee also collectively developed a point-and-area combination leadership method of "one ring enclosing another, each ring closely connected, starting with a point in each ring, and moving forward step by step." After this commune implemented the "three-seven system," before the start of spring sowing tool reform, field sowing, rice weeding, and other tasks, they would first send a committee member deep into a management area to understand the problems, create a model, and then hold an on-site meeting to organize cadres and commune members from various management areas to visit and promote it, powerfully promoting the work of each period. In mid-July, the Qixingpao Commune, during one three-day period of concentrated effort, exchanged leadership experience through the methods of speaking, establishing, and learning, making the cadres' work more practical. Through evaluation, everyone also established seven models of going to the countryside to eat, live, work, and consult with the masses. Comrade Qi Haishan, a teacher from the Commune Party Committee branch, was the best at participating in labor among the seventy-three cadres in the entire commune; during his more than eighty days of going deep into the Qixingpao management area, he worked sixty-five labor days. The Qixingpao management area, which he and two other comrades contracted, was the lowest-lying, most waterlogged, and most weed-infested management area in the entire commune. After Qi Haishan arrived at this management area, he got up early every day, barefoot, and went to the fields with the commune members to weed. The production team leader, Bi Facun, was so moved that he said to the commune members: "Old Qi is really a good cadre for us; he not only offers suggestions, but also shovels the ground with us every day."

### 深入下去“带徒弟”　集中上来“找老师”  宝清帮助干部不断提高领导水平

    深入下去“带徒弟”　集中上来“找老师”
    宝清帮助干部不断提高领导水平
    本报讯　黑龙江宝清县在推行“三七制”领导方法中，实行深入下去“带徒弟”，集中上来“找老师”的办法，帮助干部不断深入，推动了当前的生产。
    今年5月间，中共宝清县委学习了吴桥县“二五制”的领导方法后，结合本县多山、居住分散、干部下乡来往不便的特点，决定在全县推行“三七制”的领导方法。这一制度推行后，县委第一书记刘泽民和十四名县委委员，除留一名书记在县指挥外，都分片包社深入到生产第一线。推行“三七制”前，干部深入第一线的只有二百多人，推行“三七制”后增加到八百多人，加强了对生产的领导。多数干部到第一线后都作到了和社员同吃同住同劳动同商量，及时地发现和解决生产中的问题，工作更加深入、细致、踏实。但是，同时也发现有少数干部没有真正深入下去，不能及时地发现和解决生产中的问题。另有一部分新参加工作的干部，不懂得怎样走群众路线，不知道怎样才是既参加生产，又领导生产。中共宝清县委认为，干部走上生产第一线，仅仅是改进工作的第一步，进一步就是要帮助下去的干部真正深入下去，发现问题，解决问题，帮助基层把生产领导好。为了解决这个问题，县委决定：县直属机关各部门和各公社在推行“三七制”领导方法过程中，采取深入下去“带徒弟”、集中上来“找老师”的办法，帮助干部真正深入下去。县直属机关各部门和各公社党委都认真地执行了县委的这一决定，并创造出深入下去采取教、做、帮“带徒弟”，集中上来采取讲、树、学“找老师”的办法。所谓深入下去教、做、帮，就是在干部深入下去的七天中，让新参加工作的干部和有群众工作经验的干部到一个区、队去工作，在实际工作中，教给工作方法，做出样子，帮助改进工作方法。所谓集中上来讲、树、学，就是在集中到县或公社的三天中，每个干部都讲自己下乡工作成功的领导方法，树立走群众路线工作深入的榜样，学习毛主席著作提高理论认识水平。青山公社党委还集体研究出“一环套一环，环环紧相连，每环先搞点，步步走在前”的点面结合领导方法。这个公社推行“三七制”以后，在春播工具改革、大田播种、水稻锄草等工作开始之前，都先派一名委员深入到一个管理区摸清问题，搞出样子，然后开现场会，组织各管理区干部和社员参观推广，有力地推动了各个时期的工作。七星泡公社在7月中旬一次集中上来的三天内，通过讲、树、学的办法，互相交流了领导经验，使干部工作更加踏实。大家通过评选，还树立了七名下乡与群众同吃同住同劳动同商量的榜样。公社党委支部教员齐海山同志是全公社七十三名干部中参加劳动最好的一个，他在深入七星泡管理区的八十多天中干了六十五个劳动日。他和另外两名同志包干的七星泡是全公社土地最低洼、积水、草荒的一个管理区，齐海山到这个管理区之后，每天起早赤脚和社员一同下田锄草，生产队长毕法纯感动得对社员说：“老齐可真是咱们的好干部，不仅替咱们出谋划策，还每天和咱们一块铲地。”
