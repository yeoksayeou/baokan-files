Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd Dispatch from Rome: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, in a meeting with a special correspondent from the Italian newspaper "Milan Daily," stated that the United States, Britain, and France are plotting a conspiracy to split the Congo.

Lumumba's statement, published in the August 21st edition of the "Milan Daily," said that these three countries "want Katanga's uranium mines to manufacture atomic bombs; they have secret agreements with Belgium, so they are trying to keep the colonialists in Katanga."

When discussing the Congo's foreign policy, Lumumba emphasized that it is a neutral policy. He stated that the Congo advocates for the complete and genuine independence of all of Africa. He said that at the upcoming conference of African foreign ministers in Leopoldville, "we will strive to consolidate African unity, and we will also discuss how to rid Africa of Western economic domination."

Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, August 21st: Guinean radio issued a commentary on the situation in the Congo, condemning the US imperialists for undermining the Congo's independence and territorial integrity.

The commentary revealed that the entire West has entrusted the UN Secretary-General with the task of expanding imperialist rule in the Congo. Therefore, it is not surprising that just as the Congolese government exposed Hammarskjöld and expressed its lack of confidence in him, the US State Department, through its spokesman, announced that it continued to trust Hammarskjöld.

The commentary condemned the US representative to the Security Council, Lodge, for using the excuse that the UN cannot interfere in the political struggle between Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and Tshombe to cover up the US imperialist conspiracy to instigate and support the imperialist stooge Tshombe in engaging in separatist activities.

The radio commentary said, "We are happy to confirm that UN forces must not interfere in disputes between the Republic of the Congo and provincial authorities that are internal affairs. But is Lodge truly unaware that the power in Katanga is completely in the hands of Belgian troops, and that Tshombe can only act arbitrarily there with the help of Belgian rifles and machine guns? Meanwhile, the Congolese national security forces have been completely disarmed under Hammarskjöld's intervention."

The radio station also stated: "We are indeed willing to support all genuine efforts to resolve the Congo issue. However, as President Touré has stated, we firmly oppose the re-colonization of the Congo; we are equally firmly opposed to doing so even under the guise of the United Nations."

    新华社23日讯　罗马消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴在接见意大利“米兰日报”特派记者时说，美国、英国和法国正在策划分裂刚果的阴谋。
    登载在21日出版的“米兰日报”上的卢蒙巴的这篇谈话说，这三个国家“想要加丹加的铀矿来制造原子弹，它们同比利时有秘密协定，因此它们力图让殖民主义者留在加丹加”。
    卢蒙巴在谈到刚果外交政策时强调，刚果的外交政策是中立政策。卢蒙巴说，刚果主张整个非洲完全和真正独立。他说，在即将在利奥波德维尔举行的非洲国家外长会议上，“我们将努力巩固非洲的团结，我们还将讨论如何使非洲摆脱西方的经济统治。”
    新华社科纳克里21日电　几内亚电台就刚果局势发表评论，谴责美帝国主义者破坏刚果的独立和领土完整。
    评论揭露说：整个西方把在刚果扩展帝国主义统治的任务交给了联合国秘书长。因此，正当刚果政府揭露哈马舍尔德，表示不再信任他的时候，美国国务院通过自己的发言人宣布它继续信任哈马舍尔德，这是不足为怪的。
    评论谴责美国驻安理会代表洛奇在安理会会议上借口联合国不能干预刚果总理卢蒙巴和冲伯之间的政治斗争，掩盖美帝国主义怂恿和支持帝国主义走狗冲伯搞分裂活动的阴谋。
    电台评论说，我们乐于确认联合国部队不得干涉刚果共和国和省当局之间属于内政的纠纷。但是，洛奇难道对于下述情况真是不知道么：加丹加的权力完全落在比利时部队手里，冲伯只是靠比利时的步枪和机关枪才能在那里作威作福。而刚果国家安全部队却在哈马舍尔德干预之下被完全解除了武装。
    这家电台还说：我们的确愿意支持为了解决刚果问题而作出的一切真正的努力。但是，正如杜尔总统所表示的那样，我们坚决反对把刚果重新殖民地化；即使是在联合国幌子之下那样作，我们一样坚决反对。
