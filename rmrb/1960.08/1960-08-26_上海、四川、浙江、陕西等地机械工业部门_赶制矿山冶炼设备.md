Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. Workers in Shanghai's mechanical industry departments are concentrating their superior forces to ensure the completion of key product manufacturing tasks assigned this year with guaranteed quality, quantity, on time and according to variety, to support the sustained leap forward in agriculture, mining, iron smelting, and transportation departments. As of mid-August, agricultural diesel engines, threshers, metallurgical blowers, as well as crushing machinery, refrigeration compressors, and transportation machinery used in mining, generally have completed 60% to 90% of their annual plans.

In order to make fuller use of the last four months of this year, the Municipal Bureau of Mechanical Industry recently re-ranked various key products according to their production progress, based on the principle of prioritizing urgency, and formulated more specific and effective measures. Various machinery factories are also concentrating their main forces according to the production arrangements for the next four months to ensure unimpeded progress of key products.

The Shanghai mechanical industry system has also recently adopted a method of three-level division of labor among the Industrial Bureau, specialized companies, and key factories to grasp key products more effectively. Key products with a wide range of cooperation and large involvement, such as large-scale fertilizer equipment, rolling mills, and blast furnaces involving several industries and dozens of factories, are directly controlled by the Industrial Bureau, centering on the product, concentrating the forces of various factories, and uniformly forming professional teams to guarantee them; products with a smaller range of cooperation that can be completed within the industry are organized by specialized companies to coordinate the work of affiliated factories; in addition, some larger machinery factories also treat some products they undertake alone as the key points of the factory, using the method of large-scale cooperation within the factory and the three-in-one combination to ensure the completion of sets of equipment as scheduled. At present, various machinery factories have launched a upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy centered on ensuring the better completion of key product manufacturing tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu. Workers in the mechanical industry departments of Sichuan Province are actively supporting the continued leap forward of the iron and steel industry. In July, the factories under the Provincial Department of Mechanical Industry had provided 30 sets of small coal mine equipment and 57 sets of iron mine equipment for mine transformation.

When implementing national plans, Sichuan Province's mechanical industry gives top priority to the manufacturing of small coal kiln equipment, mining equipment, and small railway locomotives and vehicles. In July, the equipment tasks completed in Chengdu for steel, iron, coal, and transportation increased by more than 26% compared to June.

Local machinery departments pay attention to ensuring product quality while rushing to manufacture steel, iron, coal, and transportation equipment. The Red Flag Iron Factory strengthened the implementation of operating procedures, conducted inspections at every stage and checked at every pass, which greatly improved product quality, and there were no rejects in large parts in July. Various places also vigorously promoted technological innovation and technological revolution, and tapped the potential of raw materials. Various machinery factories in Chengdu vigorously carried out technological revolution. In July, the city reformed and successfully produced 23 kinds of products such as gas engines, transformers, air compressors, and water pumps.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou. A mass movement to vigorously manufacture mining and smelting equipment is being carried out in depth in the mechanical manufacturing departments of Zhejiang Province. In the first half of the year, the province produced 2,700 tons of mining and smelting equipment, an increase of more than double compared to the same period last year.

In the process of manufacturing mining and smelting equipment, various places attach great importance to the complete sets of equipment, taking several factories as the core, and organizing a group of product supporting factories in a planned way, giving play to the communist spirit of cooperation between factories and factories, and between regions, and supporting each other. In order to ensure the production of complete sets of equipment, various places have also taken corresponding measures in the arrangement of material supply, such as batching materials in batches and forming complete sets in small batches. By queuing products and construction projects, the needs of key equipment production such as mining, smelting, power stations, and transportation are first ensured.

The mechanical manufacturing departments in various places have vigorously engaged in technological revolution in the manufacture of mining and smelting equipment, creating and promoting many advanced experiences. Many mechanical manufacturing factories have increased production efficiency by multiples or even dozens of times.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an. While ensuring the comprehensive completion of the tasks assigned by the state, the mechanical industry in Shaanxi Province is actively rushing to manufacture iron smelting and mining equipment to support the construction and technological transformation of small blast furnaces.

At present, more than 1,700 sets of equipment (sets) such as pot camel machines, hot blast stoves, blowers, ore crushers, and feeding equipment needed for the technological transformation of small blast furnaces in the province have all been completed and transported to various iron smelting plants for installation and use; new mining and small blast furnace construction equipment is being rushed to manufacture.

In the mechanical factories undertaking the manufacturing tasks of metallurgical and mining equipment, a Party committee secretary or factory director is specially responsible for this work, and at the same time, cadres are organized to go deep into the front line of production, participate in labor, and solve key problems in production at any time. The Yumin Machinery Factory used to have low output when producing blast furnace straight pipes. After Wang Zhefu, the secretary of the Party committee, went to the workshop, he assisted the workshop in adjusting the labor organization and implementing professional assembly line operations, which quickly increased the daily output from five to thirty. The workers also tried every means to find tricks and think of ways to improve production efficiency.

    上海、四川、浙江、陕西等地机械工业部门
    赶制矿山冶炼设备
    据新华社上海讯　上海机械工业部门职工正在集中优势力量，保证按质按量按时按品种地完成今年承担的重点产品制造任务，支援农业、采掘、炼铁和运输等部门的持续跃进。到8月中旬为止，农业用柴油机、脱粒机、冶金鼓风机，以及采掘方面用的破碎机械、冷气压缩机、运输机械等，一般都已完成全年计划的60％到90％。
    为了更充分地利用今年最后四个多月的时间，市机械工业局最近根据各种重点产品的生产进度，按轻重缓急的原则重新进行了排队，并且制订了更具体有效的措施。各机械厂也根据今后四个多月生产安排的要求，集中使用主要力量，保证重点产品通行无阻。
    上海机械工业系统最近还采取工业局、专业公司、重点工厂三级分工掌握重点产品的办法，更切实有效地抓好重点产品的生产。凡是协作面较广、牵涉较大的重点产品，如大型化肥设备、轧钢机、高炉等跨几个行业、几十个工厂的设备，均由工业局直接掌握，以产品为中心，集中各厂力量，统一组成专业组加以保证；协作面较小、行业内部可以完成的产品，则由专业公司组织所属工厂协作；另外，一些规模较大的机械工厂，也把单独承担的一些产品，作为本厂的重点，运用厂内大协作的办法和三结合的形式，保证如期成套完成。目前，各机械厂都掀起了以保证更好地完成重点产品制造任务为中心的增产节约热潮。
    据新华社成都讯　四川省机械工业部门职工积极支援钢铁工业继续跃进。7月份，省机械工业厅所属各厂已为矿山改造提供了三十套小煤窑设备和五十七套铁矿山设备。
    四川省机械工业在执行国家计划时，都把小煤窑设备、矿山设备和小铁路机车车辆的制造任务作为首要任务加以安排。7月份成都市完成的钢、铁、煤、运等设备任务比6月份增长了26％以上。
    各地机械部门在赶制钢、铁、煤、运设备中，注意保证产品质量。红旗铁工厂加强贯彻操作规程，对各个工段道道检查，关关把守，使产品质量大大提高，7月份大件已无废品。各地还大闹技术革新和技术革命，大挖原料材料潜力。成都市各机械厂大闹技术革命，7月份全市改革成功的产品就有煤气机、变压器、空气压缩机、水泵等二十三种。
    据新华社杭州讯　大力制造采矿、冶炼设备的群众运动正在浙江省各地机械制造部门深入开展。全省上半年已生产出矿山采掘、冶炼设备二千七百吨，比去年同期增长一倍以上。
    各地在制造采掘、冶炼设备中，非常重视设备的成台配套，以几个厂为核心，有计划地组织一批产品配套厂，发扬厂与厂、地区与地区之间的共产主义协作精神，互相支援。为了保证设备生产成套，各地在材料供应的安排上也相应地采取了分批投料，小批成套的措施，通过产品和建设项目排队，首先确保采掘、冶炼以及电站、交通等重点设备生产的需要。
    各地机械制造部门在制造采矿、冶炼设备中，大搞技术革命，创造与推广了很多先进经验。许多机械制造厂成倍甚至几十倍地提高了生产效率。
    据新华社西安讯　陕西省机械工业在保证全面完成国家下达的任务的同时，积极赶制炼铁和矿山设备，支援小高炉建设和技术改造。
    目前，全省小高炉技术改造所需要的锅驼机、热风炉、鼓风机、矿石破碎机、加料设备等一千七百多台（套）设备已全部完成，运往各炼铁厂安装使用；新的矿山和小高炉建设设备正在赶制中。
    承担冶金、矿山设备制造任务的各机械厂，都由一名党委书记或厂长专门管理这项工作，同时组织干部深入生产第一线，参加劳动，随时解决生产中的关键问题。裕民机械厂原来生产高炉直管时产量低，党委书记王哲夫下车间后，协助车间调整了劳动组织，实行专业流水作业，很快将日产量由五个提高到三十个。工人们也千方百计找窍门、想办法，提高生产效率。
