Chinese Rice Transplanters in Cambodia
Bai Huizhen

In July, in the vast and fertile fields, Cambodian farmers braved the hot tropical sun to begin their intense and arduous rice transplanting activities. As people sped along the roads, they could see farmers in twos and threes, some plowing the fields, others bending over to plant rice seedlings one by one. How eagerly and excitedly would Cambodian farmers greet the advanced experience of improving this heavy and laborious work! It was in this season that two Chinese-made rice transplanters—the Liling No. 2 and the South 105 No. B model—presented by Premier Zhou Enlai to Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk, arrived in Phnom Penh on July 12. Using machines for transplanting was a very novel thing for Cambodian farmers, so wherever the Chinese rice transplanters performed, they created a sensation among the farmers in that area.

During Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia in early May this year, he promised to send Prince Sihanouk the blueprints and instructions for the Chinese-invented rice transplanter. Later, Premier Zhou Enlai decided to send two rice transplanters in addition to the blueprints and instructions. In order to catch up with the Cambodian transplanting season, Premier Zhou Enlai sent a special plane to Phnom Penh on July 12 to deliver these two transplanters. At the same time, He Jisheng, the inventor of the Liling No. 2 rice transplanter, and Ni Yiwei, one of the inventors of the South 105 No. B rice transplanter, also came to Phnom Penh on the same plane to introduce the method of use to Cambodian farmer brothers.

The performance of the Chinese rice transplanters in Cambodia received the attention and concern of Prince Sihanouk, who instructed the Ministry of Agriculture to make careful arrangements. According to the original plan, from July 18 to 20, three performances were held successively in Stung district of Kandal province, Phnom Penh district, and Bati district of Takeo province, receiving more than two thousand farmers. Later, Prince Sihanouk instructed the Ministry of Agriculture to organize another large-scale performance to allow more farmers to visit, because after seeing the relevant news and pictures published in the newspapers, he felt that there were not enough visitors. So, on July 25, the fourth performance was held in Samrong, Kampong Speu province. This time, more than two thousand farmers visited. Some villages sent their entire population to visit. There were more than five thousand visitors in the four performances. The Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture also attached great importance to this performance. Zheng Xinghe, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Agriculture, and responsible officials personally presided over or visited the performance. When performing in Kandal, Takeo, and Kampong Speu provinces, the governor or deputy governor and officials in charge of agriculture also visited the performance. The governor and deputy governor of Takeo province led the responsible officials of the provincial government and the heads of seven subordinate counties to visit the performance. After visiting several performances, Zheng Xinghe, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Agriculture, believed that these two rice transplanters played a very important role, providing great help to Cambodian farmers in their labor. Cambodian farmers are very interested in these two rice transplanters. Because they are easy to manufacture, low in cost, simple to operate, and highly efficient, farmers are determined to imitate and use them. He said that these two rice transplanters will make Cambodia's economy take a step forward.

Cambodian farmers visited the performance of the Chinese rice transplanters with special interest. The performances in the four places were held at nine o'clock in the morning, but the farmers in each place arrived as early as six o'clock to wait. In Takeo province, farmers waited in the rain for three hours to watch the performance. In Kampong Speu province, we encountered such a situation: The day before the performance in this province, we happened to pass by this place and saw a colorful pavilion being set up by the side of the field, people were busy arranging things, a motor was pumping water into the field, and many farmers were surrounding the embankment. We got out of the car curiously to see what everyone was busy with. It turned out that they were preparing to welcome the Chinese rice transplanters to perform here the next day. The farmers were particularly kind and enthusiastic when they saw us Chinese. An old farmer named Man, who was over eighty years old, said to us: "I have worked hard in farming all my life. This time I must see the Chinese good way of using rice transplanters." The next day when we came here again, the dark crowd of more than two thousand farmers surrounded a plot of paddy field of more than one mu (Chinese mu). There were too many visitors, and we simply couldn't find the old man again to hear his impressions of the Chinese rice transplanters. In each of the four places, it was the same. Every time after the two comrades He Jisheng and Ni Yiwei finished their performance, the male and female farmers went down to the field one after another and rushed to practice operating the Liling No. 2 rice transplanter. Many farmers were fascinated by this wooden, simple and ingenious machine that could transplant seven seedlings at a time, and they couldn't wait to learn how to use it all at once. At this time, Comrade He Jisheng was also very busy. He was always sweating profusely, and through gestures and holding the hands of Cambodian farmer brothers, he overcame the obstacle of language barrier and taught the operation method to the Cambodian farmer brothers without reservation. Obviously, it was impossible to give every visitor the opportunity to practice on the spot. Therefore, many farmers and some carpenters surrounded the three Liling No. 2 rice transplanters made locally. They touched them again and again, looked at them again and again, and everyone discussed the function and structural principle of each part in their own words for a long time, unwilling to leave. Farmers and carpenters who brought paper, pens, and rulers also drew sketches to prepare for imitation. Similarly, a group of farmers also surrounded the South 105 No. B rice transplanter, studying its structure and performance.

The advantages of transplanting with rice transplanters are beyond doubt, but it is not yet possible to give a definite answer as to how many people's labor one machine can replace. An interesting thing happened during the performance in Kampong Speu province. A farmer named Benmu suggested that He Jisheng, the inventor of the Liling No. 2 rice transplanter, use the rice transplanter and four Cambodian farmers use manual labor for a competition. So the brewing and organization work began, but unfortunately this "competition" did not yield any results, because some farmers said: "It's not comparable, four people can't compare with that Chinese gentleman at all."

Cambodian rural women were also attracted by the Chinese rice transplanters. A woman in Takeo province said: "I have never seen transplanting with machines. In the past, when transplanting, my fingernails were worn off." She believed that the Liling No. 2 rice transplanter had a simple structure and every family could make one.

Through four successful experiments on different soil types, all visitors unanimously agreed that the Chinese rice transplanters were completely suitable for promotion and use in Cambodia, especially the Liling No. 2 made of wood and bamboo. Zheng Xinghe, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Agriculture, said that he would manufacture several units and distribute one to each province for promotion. Ye Jinzhen, Deputy Governor of Kandal Province, also said that he would manufacture one for each county as a model, and then the county would promote it to the farmers. Cambodian officials who visited the performance of the Chinese rice transplanters were confident that the promotion of the Liling No. 2 rice transplanter in Cambodia was fully assured.

Cambodian public opinion also paid close attention to the performance of the Chinese rice transplanters in Cambodia with great interest. Local Khmer, French, Chinese, and Vietnamese newspapers have repeatedly published news or comments and introduced Chinese rice transplanters with pictures. The "Nationalist" weekly, sponsored by Prince Sihanouk, not only published news, but also published six related pictures in one issue of the newspaper. The newspaper said: "This is a generous assistance from Chinese friends that is directly beneficial to our farmers." It also said: "The 'Nationalist' weekly sincerely and enthusiastically praises the wisdom of the Chinese leaders, who are very good at choosing assistance that can truly improve the lives of our farmers." "Friendship News" said: "We must remember that this kind of assistance is very valuable to Cambodia. It shows that China is our loyal friend, helping peaceful and neutral Cambodia in all aspects according to Cambodia's needs."

Indeed, the successful performance of the Chinese rice transplanters in Cambodia has once again enabled the people of China and Cambodia to exchange experience in agricultural production, and further enhanced and consolidated the brotherly friendship between the two peoples. (Attached picture)

    中国插秧机在柬埔寨
    白慧贞
    7月间，在广阔而肥沃的田野里，柬埔寨农民顶着炎热的热带阳光开始了紧张而繁重的水稻插秧活动。当人们乘车奔驰在公路上时，可以看到三三两两的农民有的在犁田，有的弯腰曲背地把一棵棵秧苗插在田里。如果能够得到改进这种粗重而辛苦的劳动的先进经验，对柬埔寨农民说来该是多么渴望和兴奋的事啊！正是在这个季节，周恩来总理送给柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王的两部中国制造的水稻插秧机——醴陵二号和南105号B型于7月12日运抵金边。用机器插秧对于柬埔寨农民是一件非常新奇的事，因而中国插秧机到什么地方表演，就轰动了那个地区的农民。
    今年5月初周恩来总理访问柬埔寨王国时，曾答应把中国发明的水稻插秧机的蓝图和说明送给西哈努克亲王，后来，周恩来总理决定除了蓝图和说明之外再送两部水稻插秧机去。为了赶上柬埔寨的插秧季节，周恩来总理在7月12日派专机把这两部插秧机送到金边。同时醴陵二号插秧机的发明人贺继生和南105号B型插秧机发明人之一倪已维也同机来到金边，向柬埔寨农民兄弟介绍使用方法。
    中国插秧机在柬埔寨的表演，受到了西哈努克亲王的重视与关怀，他指示农业部作了细致的安排。按照原计划，从7月18日到20日先后在干丹省斯登县、金边县和茶胶省巴地县进行了三次表演，共接待了两千多个农民参观。以后，西哈努克亲王又指示农业部再组织一次大规模的表演，让更多的农民参观。因为他在看到报纸上发表的有关消息和图片后，认为参观的群众还不够多。于是，7月25日又在磅士卑省的萨木隆地方进行了第四次表演。这一次参观的农民达两千多人。有的村子全村的人都来参观了。前后四次表演共有五千多人参观。柬埔寨农业部也极为重视这次表演。农业部国务秘书郑兴和负责官员更是亲自主持或参观表演。在干丹、茶胶和磅士卑等省表演时，省长或副省长以及负责农业的官员也都参观了表演。茶胶省长和副省长就曾率领省政府的负责官员和下属七个县的县长参观了表演。农业部国务秘书郑兴在参观了几次表演后认为，这两部插秧机具有很重要的作用，它对柬埔寨农民在劳动上给予了很大的帮助。柬埔寨农民对这两部插秧机很感兴趣。由于它的制造容易、成本低、操作简单、效率高，农民们都决心仿造使用。他表示，这两部插秧机将会使柬埔寨的经济向前跨进一步。
    柬埔寨农民更是以特别的兴趣参观了中国插秧机的表演。在四个地方表演时，都是在上午九点钟举行，但是，每个地方的农民都是早在六点钟就来等着了。在茶胶省农民在雨里淋了三个小时等待看表演。在磅士卑省我们遇到了这样一个情况：在这个省表演的头一天，我们以偶然的机会经过了这个地方，看到在田边搭起一座彩色凉台，人们在忙着布置，台下马达把水抽到了田里，在田埂上围了很多农民，我们好奇地下了车看看大家在忙什么事情，原来是为了迎接第二天中国插秧机来这里表演。农民们看到我们这些中国人格外亲切、热情。一位名叫曼的八十多岁高龄的老农民对我们说：“我种田辛苦了一辈子，这一次一定要看看中国用插秧机的好办法。”第二天我们再到这里时，黑压压的两千多农民把一块一亩（中国亩）多点的水田团团围住了，参观的人太多了，我们简直没有办法再找到这位老人，听听他对中国插秧机的印象。在四个地方每处都是一样，每当贺继生和倪已维两个同志表演完了以后，男女农民们纷纷下田抢着用醴陵二号插秧机练习操作。很多农民被这个木制的、简单而灵巧、一次就能插七撮秧苗的机器迷住了，恨不得一下子就学会使用它。这时也忙坏了贺继生同志，他总是汗流浃背地，通过手势和扶着柬埔寨农民兄弟的手，突破了语言不通的障碍，毫无保留地把操作方法教给柬埔寨农民兄弟。显然，要使每个参观者都能有实地练习的机会是不可能的，因此，很多农民和一些木工都围住了在当地制造的三部醴陵二号插秧机，他们摸了又摸，看了又看，大家你一言我一语地研究每个零件的作用和构造原理，很久不愿离开。带了纸笔和尺的农民和木工也都把草图画了下来，准备仿制。同样也有一批农民围住了南105号B型插秧机，研究它的构造和性能。
    用插秧机插秧的优点是毫无怀疑了，但是，到底一架机器能抵得几个人的劳动，还得不出一个确实的答案。在磅士卑省表演时发生了这么一件有趣的事，一个叫奔木的农民提议由醴陵二号插秧机的发明人贺继生使用插秧机和四个柬埔寨农民用手工来一次比赛。于是酝酿和组织工作开始了，但是，很可惜这场“比赛”没有得到结果，因为一些农民说：“比不得，四个人根本比不过那位中国先生。”
    柬埔寨农村妇女也被中国插秧机所吸引住了，茶胶省的一位妇女说：“我从来没有看见过用机器插秧，过去插秧时把手指甲都磨没有了。”她认为醴陵二号插秧机构造简单，每家都可以造一部。
    通过四次在不同的土质上的成功试验，所有的参观者一致认为中国插秧机完全适合在柬埔寨推广使用，特别是用木料和竹子制造的醴陵二号。农业部国务秘书郑兴表示要制造若干部，每个省发给一部进行推广。干丹省副省长叶金祯也表示要为每个县制造一部作为样子，再由县向农民推广。参观了中国插秧机表演的柬埔寨官员，都有信心地认为在柬埔寨推广醴陵二号插秧机是满有把握的。
    柬埔寨的舆论更以浓厚的兴趣注视着中国插秧机在柬埔寨的表演。这里的柬、法、华、越文报纸都多次发表消息或评论并配合图片介绍中国插秧机。由西哈努克亲王主办的“民族主义者”周刊不仅发表了消息，同时在一期报上就登了六张有关的图片。这家报纸说：“这是中国朋友对我国农民直接有利的慷慨的援助。”又说：“民族主义者”周刊诚恳而热烈地赞扬中国领导人的明智，很会选择能真正提高我国农民生活的援助。”“友谊报”说：“我们必须记住，这种援助对我们柬埔寨来说是非常有价值的。它表明中国是我们忠诚的朋友，从各方面根据柬埔寨的需要帮助和平和中立的柬埔寨。”
    的确，中国插秧机在柬埔寨成功的表演，又一次使中柬两国人民在农业生产上交流了经验，进一步增进和巩固了两国人民的情同手足般的友谊。（附图片）
