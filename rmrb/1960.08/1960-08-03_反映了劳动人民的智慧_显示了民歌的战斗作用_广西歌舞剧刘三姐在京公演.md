Xinhua News Agency, August 1st: The beautiful, moving, and uniquely styled song and dance drama "Liu Sanjie," performed by the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Folk Song and Dance Troupe, premiered in Beijing on August 1st, winning unanimous praise from the capital's literary and art circles and audiences.

The Liu Sanjie appearing on stage today is a rural girl full of fighting spirit, intelligence, bravery, diligence, beauty, and a talent for singing. Full of optimism, she uses songs to praise labor and nature, express the wishes and ideals of the working people, and is deeply loved by the working masses. She also boldly uses songs to expose the exploitation and oppression of the working people by the feudal ruling class. As a result, she is persecuted by the feudal ruling class, who are stung by her songs, and cannot find a place to live, forcing her to flee from place to place. However, no matter what kind of persecution Liu Sanjie suffers, she never becomes discouraged or succumbs. She continues to sing loudly everywhere: "As long as the long flowing water remains, one day it will wash away the ninefold mountains;" she still sings righteously: "Going up the mountain, there's a stick to beat snakes; going down the water, there's a net to catch turtles; if there's reason, I dare to scold the emperor, regardless of whether you're a master or not." Among the working people, Liu Sanjie's "mountain songs are like dragon spring water, flowing everywhere in the deep mountains and old forests;" when Liu Sanjie sings mountain songs, "one person sings and ten thousand harmonize, singing makes the poor laugh heartily, and makes the rich tremble."

The "Liu Sanjie" song and dance drama adopts the unique forms of song fairs and song stages loved by the Zhuang people, attracting the audience from beginning to end with beautiful mountain song melodies and folk song lyrics that are popular and well-honed. Many people in literary and art circles, after watching this song and dance drama, believe that it not only provides people with the appreciation of song and dance art, but also gives people the enjoyment of beautiful literary language. The audience generally believes that the lyrics of this play are full of the vivid and figurative language of the masses, reflecting the love, hatred, and wisdom of the working people, and displaying the militant role of folk songs.

"Liu Sanjie" was originally a beautiful folk tale widely circulated in Guangxi. Last year, in order to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, the Liuzhou Cai Tiao Troupe of Guangxi, based on this legend, took its essence, removed its dross, used the cai tiao popular in Guangxi as a foundation, and absorbed the literary and artistic forms of folk song lyrics and singing that were deeply loved by the masses to create the play "Liu Sanjie." Subsequently, a mass cultural activity upsurge of large-scale creation and performance of "Liu Sanjie" was launched throughout the entire autonomous region, with more than 1,200 professional and amateur troupes performing "Liu Sanjie," reaching an audience of 12 million people. Through the large-scale creation and performance of "Liu Sanjie," a new situation of great prosperity, great popularization, and great improvement emerged in mass cultural activities throughout the region. In April of this year, according to the decision of the regional party committee, a regional literary and artistic performance of "Liu Sanjie" with different genres and different scripts was held. The song and dance drama "Liu Sanjie" now being performed in the capital is an adaptation that concentrates the essence of various scripts and singing styles in the concentrated performance. Some of the actors in this play were also selected from activists in mass cultural activities. (Attached photo)

    反映了劳动人民的智慧　显示了民歌的战斗作用
    广西歌舞剧刘三姐在京公演
    新华社1日讯　优美动人、风格独特的歌舞剧“刘三姐”，由广西僮族自治区民间歌舞剧演出团于8月1日在京公演，博得了首都文艺界和观众的一致好评。
    今天，舞台上出现的刘三姐，是一个富于斗争精神的聪慧、勇敢、勤劳、美丽而又善于歌唱的农村姑娘。她充满乐观情绪地用歌唱赞美劳动，赞美自然，表达劳动人民的愿望和理想，深得劳动群众的爱戴。她也大胆地用歌唱揭露封建统治阶级对劳动人民的剥削和压迫，因而受到被她的歌唱所刺痛的封建统治阶级的迫害，到处不能容身，不得不逃一地又一地。但是，刘三姐不管受到怎样的迫害，她始终不气馁，不屈服，她仍然到处高唱着：“只要留得长流水，有朝冲倒九重山”；她仍然理直气壮地唱道：“上山有棍打得蛇，下水有网捉得鳖，有理敢把皇帝骂，管你老爷不老爷”。在劳动人民中，刘三姐的“山歌好比龙泉水，深山老林处处流”；刘三姐唱山歌，“一人唱来万人和，唱得穷人哈哈笑，唱得财主打哆嗦”。
    “刘三姐”歌舞剧采用了僮族人民喜爱的歌圩、歌台等别致形式，自始至终用优美的山歌曲调，用群众喜闻乐见、千锤百炼的民歌歌词吸引着观众。文艺界许多人士观看了这出歌舞剧之后，认为它不仅给予人们歌舞艺术的欣赏，而且还给予人们以优美的文学语言的享受。观众普遍认为，这个剧的歌辞充满了群众的生动、形象的语言，反映了劳动人民的爱憎和智慧，显示了民歌的战斗作用。
    “刘三姐”原是在广西广为流传的一个美丽的民间传说。去年为迎接建国十周年，广西柳州彩调团根据这一传说，取其精华，去其糟粕，运用流行在广西民间的彩调为基础，吸收了深为群众喜闻乐见的民歌的歌词和唱腔的文艺形式，创编了“刘三姐”这个戏。随后，全自治区掀起了大编大演“刘三姐”的群众性的文艺活动高潮，有一千二百多个专业和业余剧团演出了“刘三姐”，观众达一千二百万人次。通过大编大演“刘三姐”，全区群众文艺活动出现了大繁荣、大普及、大提高的新局面。今年4月间，根据区党委的决定，又举行了全区不同剧种、不同剧本的“刘三姐”文艺会演。现在首都公演的歌舞剧“刘三姐”，是集中会演当中各个剧本和唱腔的精华改编而成的。这个戏的演员也有一部分是从群众文艺活动积极分子中挑选出来的。（附图片）
