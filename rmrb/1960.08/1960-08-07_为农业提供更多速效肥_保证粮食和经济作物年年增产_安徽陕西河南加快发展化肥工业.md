Anhui
    Our newspaper, Hefei, 6th of August. In less than half a year, Anhui Province has already built eleven synthetic ammonia fertilizer plants each with an annual output of 800 tons (not counting the one with an annual output of 400 tons that was built and put into production last year). Another eight are being installed, and nineteen are under intensive construction. On the basis of vigorously developing pig raising and manure accumulation, and using large quantities of organic fertilizer, the combined application of chemical fertilizers such as ammonia water will play a significant role in rapidly improving agricultural production.
    Synthetic ammonia production is an emerging industry in Anhui Province. The equipment manufacturing, construction, installation, and operating technology required for this type of production are relatively high and demand precision. Initially, many people held mystical views about it. Therefore, in July of last year, Anhui Province decided to first concentrate its efforts on using equipment manufactured within the province to build a "model" plant with an annual output of 400 tons of synthetic ammonia in Shushan People's Commune, a suburb of Hefei. During the construction of the plant, Zeng Xisheng, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Li Renzhi, the Secretary for Industry, frequently visited the site to give instructions; all relevant departments provided strong support. As a result, the plant was built in only forty-seven days and produced ammonia water. The completion and commissioning of this plant liberated people's thinking, boosted their confidence and enthusiasm, and laid the foundation for the large-scale establishment of small synthetic ammonia plants. In the fourth quarter of last year, Anhui Province decided to build the first batch of twenty synthetic ammonia plants with an annual output of 800 tons, and first helped each prefecture establish a set of "model" plants, and then each prefecture built its own. The province and prefectures established "Chemical Fertilizer Plant Construction Headquarters," with the Party committee secretary personally taking charge, rapidly launching a high tide of large-scale construction of chemical fertilizer "small foreign groups" throughout the province.
    In terms of equipment manufacturing, Anhui Province adopted the method of specialized manufacturing by equipment type and unified matching, organizing large-scale factories with better equipment in the province to produce the main equipment in batches; for equipment that was easy to manufacture and in large quantities, the machinery factories of each prefecture and city were responsible for production. More than sixty factories in the province participated in the manufacturing of the main equipment for chemical fertilizer plants, with more than one hundred factories participating in the collaboration. In the process of equipment manufacturing, workers produced their own raw materials, cleaned warehouses, and used substitutes, finally solving the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and incomplete specifications and varieties. In terms of design, the Provincial Chemical Research Institute, the Provincial Department of Machinery Design Institute, and students from some universities were concentrated, and cross-cutting methods such as drawing, modifying, tracing, and blueprinting were adopted, so that the design that usually took more than three months to complete was completed in seven days and delivered to the construction site in advance.
    Anhui Province has also independently trained a large number of technical personnel for design, installation and construction, and production operation. There are two thousand people in the province who have undergone short-term training or are currently in training, and they participate in practical work while learning. The more than 210 workers who participated in the installation of the Wuhu Alliance Chemical Fertilizer Plant had an average age of only twenty years. Because of their hard work and diligence, they completed the entire plant's installation in only twenty-seven days with excellent quality. The plant has officially been put into production. At present, each prefecture has trained a prefecture installation team of fifty to sixty workers. After the design personnel of the prefecture have been trained in the design of the first batch of plants, they are now starting to design small synthetic ammonia plants for each county.

Shaanxi
    Our newspaper, Xi'an, 6th of August. Employees of the chemical industry system in Shaanxi Province actively participated in the movement to support agriculture, and in a very short period of time, they helped counties and communes build more than 4,000 small chemical fertilizer plants and small pesticide plants, forming a preliminary chemical fertilizer network in rural Shaanxi, which strongly supported agricultural production.
    In order to help counties and communes develop the chemical fertilizer industry, the Shaanxi Provincial Chemical Bureau, the Chemical Research and Design Institute, and chemical schools successively dispatched cadres and technicians to counties and communes in southern, central, and northern Shaanxi in early this year to conduct on-the-spot investigations of chemical raw material resources and soil conditions. They also organized expert appraisal groups to study and evaluate the products and production methods of the old small earthen chemical fertilizer plants in the counties and communes, and summarized more than 30 kinds of earthen methods for producing chemical fertilizers and pesticides, such as recovering ammonium sulfate from brick kiln waste gas, producing saltpeter by earthen methods, manufacturing potassium chloride from potash feldspar, and extracting nitrogen fertilizer from peat, which were printed into technical materials to guide the counties and people's communes in building factories. Relevant departments also held long-term training classes and organized chemical factories to take on apprentices, training more than 1,000 technical personnel and workers for the production and chemical analysis of chemical fertilizers for counties and people's communes, preparing technical forces for the development of county and commune chemical fertilizer industries.
    In the process of helping counties and communes to establish large-scale chemical fertilizer plants, chemical factories, schools, and technical departments throughout the province have all undertaken the responsibility of providing assistance to specific areas and being linked to counties and communes. They transferred a large number of technical cadres to form work groups, which went to counties, communes, and teams to help solve various problems in plant construction and production. Hancheng and Shangxian have abundant potash feldspar, so they helped build many potash fertilizer plants; Hanzhong Prefecture has abundant phosphate rock, and the soil is suitable for the use of phosphate fertilizer, so the Provincial Chemical Bureau and relevant chemical factories in Hanzhong City helped counties and communes with phosphate rock resources build small phosphate fertilizer plants. Employees of the Tongchuan City Chemical Factory used their own factory as a school and invited 36 commune members and cadres from the twelve communes linked to them to study production technology at the factory; after the students completed their studies, they sent people to the communes to provide specific assistance in building factories. With their help, the twelve people's communes in the city quickly built thirteen factories producing chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and chemical raw materials.
    The 4,000 small chemical fertilizer plants and pesticide plants newly built by the Shaanxi Provincial Chemical System to help counties and communes are now beginning to play a role in agricultural production. At present, each plant can produce more than five kinds of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and chemical raw materials using earthen methods, including ammonium sulfate, potassium chloride, calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer, bacterial fertilizer, humic acid, chlortetracycline for livestock, and BHC, etc. The Communist Youth League Chemical Fertilizer Plant of the Duanjia Commune in Dali County has produced 123 kinds of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and chemical raw materials using earthen methods, totaling more than 1.9 million catties, strongly supporting the commune's grain and cotton production.

Henan
    Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 6th of August. The chemical industry departments of Henan Province are doing everything possible to increase the production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to support agriculture. The output of chemical fertilizers and pesticides produced in the province in the first half of this year increased by three to five times compared with the same period last year, and the output in July increased again compared with June.
    Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of local Party committees, chemical departments in various places have conscientiously implemented the policy of "self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium, and small enterprises," and launched a mass movement to vigorously develop chemical fertilizers and pesticides throughout the province. From cities to rural areas, many places have established chemical fertilizer plants and pesticide plants. According to current statistics, there are more than 3,000 county and commune-run chemical fertilizer plants in the province, an increase of two times compared with last year, forming a preliminary chemical fertilizer production network from the province and counties to the communes. In the movement to vigorously develop chemical fertilizer and pesticide production, Yongcheng County, based on its technical and equipment conditions and resource situation, adopted the method of division of labor and cooperation among counties, communes, and production teams, and established 344 chemical fertilizer plants at the county, commune, and team levels in a very short period of time, with a daily output of more than 500 tons of various chemical fertilizers.
    In the mass movement to vigorously develop chemical fertilizer and pesticide production, many factory employees have launched technical innovations and technical revolutions around the key to production, thus greatly tapping the production potential and promoting production. Employees of the Jiantou Commune Chemical Fertilizer Plant in Xincai County, targeting the key to low production efficiency of manual operation, launched a tool reform, and after many experiments, created advanced tools such as automatic edge rollers and flat cars for transporting materials, realizing mechanization of crushing, screening, feeding, and mixing. The daily output of local chemical fertilizer quickly increased from 20,000 catties to 80,000 catties. Leading cadres and technical personnel of the Zhengzhou Pesticide Factory divided up their responsibilities and went deep into the front line of production to vigorously promote the use of new technologies and new experiences. They have now developed 36 sets of new processes and more than 800 new experiences, promoting a multiple increase in production efficiency. From January to June, the factory's pesticide output increased by 44.9% compared with the same period last year, and the product varieties increased from 19 to 71.
    While vigorously developing chemical fertilizer and pesticide production, the chemical departments of Henan Province are also stepping up the construction of large and medium-sized chemical fertilizer plants. Several large and medium-sized chemical enterprises such as the Kaifeng Chemical Fertilizer Plant will continue to expand and put into production this year.

    为农业提供更多速效肥　保证粮食和经济作物年年增产
    安徽陕西河南加快发展化肥工业	安　徽
    本报合肥6日电安徽省在不到半年的时间内，已经建成十一个每个年产八百吨合成氨化肥厂（去年建成投入生产的年产四百吨的一个厂未计算在内），另外有八个正在安装，十九个正在加紧建设。在大力发展养猪积肥、大量使用有机肥料的基础上，配合施用氨水等化学肥料，对迅速提高农业生产，将起很大作用。
    合成氨生产是安徽省的新兴工业。这种生产的设备制造、建筑安装和操作技术等要求都较高，精密度强。开始时，不少人对它抱有神秘观点。因此在去年7月，安徽省就决定首先集中力量利用本省制造的设备在合肥市郊蜀山人民公社，建设一座年产四百吨合成氨的“样板”厂。建厂时，省委第一书记曾希圣和工业书记李任之经常到现场作指示；各个有关部门都大力进行支援，结果只用了四十七天就把厂建成了，并生产出了氨水。这个厂的建成和投入生产，解放了人们的思想，增强了信心和干劲，为大办小合成氨厂打下了基础。去年第四季度，安徽省便决定兴建第一批二十个年产八百吨合成氨厂，并先帮助各专区建立一套“样板”厂，然后再由各专区自己建设。省、专区都成立了“化肥厂建设指挥部”，党委书记亲自挂帅，在全省范围内迅速掀起了大建化肥“小洋群”的高潮。
    在设备制造方面，安徽省采取按设备专业分工制造，统一配套的办法，组织全省规模较大、设备较好的厂成批生产主要设备；对容易制造、而数量又多的设备，则由各专、市的机械厂进行生产。全省参加制造化肥厂主要设备的有六十多个工厂，加上协作的工厂共有一百多个。在设备制造过程中，工人们自己生产原材料、清理仓库、使用代用品，终于解决了原材料不足和规格品种不齐的困难。在设计方面，集中了省化工研究院、省机械厅设计院以及部分高等学校学生，采取边制图、边修改、边描校、边晒图等交叉办法，使通常情况下需要三个多月才能完成的设计在七天内完成，提前交付施工。
    安徽省还自力更生培养了大批设计、安装施工和生产操作的技术力量。全省经过短期学习或正在培训的有两千人，他们一边学习，一边参加实际工作。参加芜湖联盟化肥厂安装的二百一十多名工人，年龄平均只有二十岁，由于他们苦学苦干，只用了二十七天时间，就完成了全厂 的安装任务，质量很好，这个厂已正式投入生产。目前，各专区都已培养了五十至六十名工人的专区安装队，专区设计人员经过第一批厂的设计锻炼后，现在又开始为各县进行小型合成氨厂的设计工作。	陕　西
    本报西安6日电陕西省化工系统职工积极投入支援农业的运动，在很短的时间内就帮助各县和公社建起了四千多个小化肥厂、小农药厂，在陕西农村中初步形成了一个化肥网，有力地支援了农业生产。
    为了帮助各县、社发展化肥工业，陕西省化工局、化工研究设计院和化工学校等单位，在今年年初就陆续派出干部和技术人员，到陕南、关中和陕北各县、社，就地调查化工原料资源和土壤情况，并且组织专家鉴定组，对各县社旧有小土化肥厂的产品、生产方法等进行了研究鉴定，总结出砖瓦窑废气回收硫酸铵、土法生产火硝、钾长石制造氯化钾和用泥炭提炼氮肥等三十多种土法生产化肥、农药的经验，印成技术资料，指导各县和人民公社建厂。有关部门还举办了较长期的训练班和组织各化工厂带徒弟，为各县和人民公社培养了一千多名生产和化验分析化肥的技术人员和工人，为发展县、社化肥工业准备了技术力量。
    在帮助各县社大办化肥厂的过程中，全省各化工厂、学校和技术部门，都分片包干和各县、公社挂钩。他们抽调了大批技术干部，组成工作组，到县到社到队，帮助解决建厂和生产中的种种问题。韩城、商县钾长石多，他们就帮助建立了不少钾肥厂；汉中专区的磷矿石多，土壤又适于使用磷肥，省化工局和汉中市有关化工厂就帮助有磷矿资源的县、社建设小型磷肥厂。铜川市化工厂职工以自己的工厂为学校，先后把同自己挂钩的十二个公社的三十六名社员和干部，请到工厂学习生产技术；学员学成后，他们又派人到各公社去具体帮助建厂。全市十二个人民公社在他们的帮助下，很快就建设起十三个生产化肥、农药的工厂。
    陕西省化工系统帮助各县、公社新建起来的四千个小化肥厂、农药厂，现在已在农业生产上开始发挥作用。目前，每个厂都能用土办法生产五种以上的化肥、农药和化工原料，其中有硫酸铵、氯化钾、钙镁磷肥、菌肥、胡敏酸、畜用金霉素、六六六等。大荔县段家公社共青团化肥厂已经用土办法生产出化肥、农药和化工原料一百二十三种，共一百九十多万斤，有力地支援了公社粮棉生产。	河　南
    本报郑州6日电河南省化学工业部门职工千方百计增产化肥、农药支援农业，今年上半年全省生产的化肥、农药比去年同期增长了三倍到五倍，7月份的产量又比6月份增长。
    今年以来，各地化工部门在当地党委的领导下，认真贯彻“自力更生，土洋并举，大中小相结合”的方针，在全省范围内掀起了一个大搞化肥、农药的群众运动。从城市到农村，许多地方都建立起化肥厂、农药厂。据目前统计，全省县、社营化肥厂已有三千多个，比去年增加了两倍，初步形成了从省、县到公社的化肥生产网。永城县在大搞化肥、农药生产运动中，根据技术、设备条件与资源情况，采取县、社、生产队分工协作的办法，在很短时间内，就建立了县、社、队三级化肥厂三百四十四个，日产各种化肥达到五百多吨。
    在大搞化肥、农药生产运动中，许多工厂职工都围绕生产关键大闹技术革新与技术革命，因而大大挖掘了生产潜力，推动了生产。新蔡县涧头公社化肥厂职工针对手工操作生产效率低的关键，大闹工具改革，经过多次试验，创造成自动立碾、平车运料等先进工具，实现了粉碎、过筛、上料、搅拌机械化，日产土化肥迅速由二万斤提高到八万斤。郑州农药厂领导干部和技术人员，分工包干，深入生产第一线，大抓新技术、新经验的推广使用，现在已配成三十六套新工艺、八百多项新经验，促进生产效率成倍提高，1至6月份全厂的农药产量比去年同期增产了44.9％，产品品种由十九种增加到七十一种。
    河南省化工部门在大抓化肥、农药生产的同时，还加紧建设大、中型化肥厂。开封化肥厂等好几个大、中型化工企业都将在今年继续扩建和投入生产。
