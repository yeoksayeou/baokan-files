    A Great Creation in Space Flight
    Commentator of this newspaper

    The second Soviet spaceship launched on August 19th, after completing its planned one-day and one-night scientific exploration program, has safely and accurately returned to Earth according to commands issued from the ground. The success of the Soviet Union in launching and returning a spaceship to Earth is a prelude to mankind's flight to interplanetary space, indicating that the realization of this aspiration is not far off. This is another significant contribution by the Soviet people on the road to conquering space, and another creation in scientific endeavors. The Chinese people express warm congratulations to the Soviet people, scientists, and engineers for this great achievement!
    The Soviet Union's research on space flight is being carried out step by step according to a scientific plan. Each experiment has a new purpose. This time, the launch of the second spaceship was a comprehensive experiment conducted by Soviet scientists for human space flight. The safe landing of the spaceship marks the fact that Soviet scientists have broken through the final barrier in returning a spaceship to Earth. The spaceship safely passed through the dense atmosphere, proving that the specialized heat shield of this satellite-type spacecraft can ensure the safe return of humans from space flight to Earth. This is a new development in science and technology. Moreover, the landing point of the satellite-type spacecraft was only ten kilometers away from the predetermined location, indicating that the operation system and braking device of the spacecraft worked with unparalleled precision. It is also worth mentioning that the two dogs, the passengers on the second spaceship who completed the first space flight in human history, have safely returned, and they feel well after the flight and landing. This experiment shows that Soviet scientists have been able to prepare conditions for animals to live in outer space close to ground conditions. The successful return of the second spaceship has brought back a large amount of extremely valuable material, which will further promote the early realization of human space flight.
    It has been less than three years since the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite was launched into space. In this short period, Soviet research in space flight has continued to develop rapidly. This year alone, the Soviet Union has launched ballistic rockets into the Pacific region twice and launched spaceships twice. The outstanding efforts of Soviet scientists and engineers have opened up the path for mankind to enter interplanetary flight. The tremendous progress made by the Soviet Union in space flight research has left the United States further and further behind. The new achievements of Soviet science and technology demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and will powerfully encourage and strengthen the struggle of people of all countries for world peace and human progress.

    宇宙飞行的一大创举
    本报评论员
    苏联在8月19日发射的第二个宇宙飞船，在完成了预计一昼夜的科学考察计划之后，根据地面发出的命令，已经安全而准确地返回地球。苏联宇宙飞船发射和返回地球的成功，是人类飞往行星际空间的前奏，说明人类实现这一愿望已经为期不远了。这是苏联人民在征服宇宙的道路上的又一重大贡献，也是科学事业上的又一创举。中国人民对苏联人民、科学家和工程技术人员的这一重大成就表示热烈祝贺！
    苏联对于宇宙飞行的研究，是按照科学计划有步骤地进行的。每一次试验，都有新的目的。这一次发射第二个宇宙飞船，是苏联科学家为人类作宇宙飞行进行的一次全面的试验。宇宙飞船的安全着落，标志着苏联科学家已经突破了宇宙飞船返回地面的最后一关。宇宙飞船安全地通过了稠密的大气层，证明了这个卫星式飞船的专门防热层，能够保证人类从宇宙飞行中安全返回地球。这是在科学技术上的一个新的发展。而卫星式飞船的着陆点，同预定地点只差十公里，说明了飞船的操纵系统和制动装置的工作，无比精确。还值得提到的，就是第二个宇宙飞船上的乘客、完成了人类历史上第一次宇宙飞行的两只小狗，已经安全回来，它们在飞行和着陆之后感觉良好。这一试验，表明了苏联科学家已经能够为动物准备了在宇宙空间接近地面生活的条件。第二个宇宙飞船成功返回，带回来了大量极其珍贵的材料，必将进一步促使人类宇宙飞行的早日实现。
    从苏联第一个人造卫星上天到现在还不满三年，在这短短的时间里，苏联在宇宙飞行方面的研究获得不断的迅速的发展。仅仅今年以来，苏联就两次向太平洋地区发射了弹道火箭，两次发射了宇宙飞船。苏联科学家和工程技术人员的卓越努力，开辟了人类进入行星际飞行的道路。苏联在宇宙飞行方面研究的巨大进展，把美国越来越远地抛在后面了。苏联科学技术的新成就，显示了社会主义制度无比的优越性，将有力地鼓舞和加强各国人民争取世界和平和人类进步的斗争。
