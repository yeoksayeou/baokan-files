Labor is Forever the Source of Creation	Liu Yong
    I am a very ordinary peasant. Before liberation, I herded cattle for landlords, and life was more bitter than gall. Only after liberation did I study culture in night school, and in the second half of 1952, I started learning to write articles.

    Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we were allocated land and houses. The first time I labored on my own land, my heart blossomed with joy. We treated the land as treasure, plowing deeply, applying fertilizer meticulously, and producing more grain to build our new countryside. Many heroic models emerged in labor, and I labored with them, loving them very much. At this time, I had an idea: how wonderful it would be if I could compose some folk songs to sing out the joy in my heart and the labor enthusiasm of everyone! I told my idea to our District Committee Secretary Wang. Secretary Wang enthusiastically encouraged me, talked to me about the development prospects of the countryside, and sent me to the county's cadre training class to study, which helped me understand many truths about being liberated and see clearly the development prospects of the countryside. One day, while we were reclaiming wasteland on the mountain, we composed a folk song:

    Thinking of turning over a new leaf, I love to sing,
    The singing shakes the barren hillsides,
    Thousands of hoes reclaim the wasteland,
    Everywhere seeds are sown,
    Building our new countryside,
    Happiness for generations to come.

    Singing such folk songs further inspired everyone's labor enthusiasm and fighting will. When there was no water in the dry fields, everyone dug ponds on the mountain, and the thousand-year-old wasteland was turned into paddy fields. What great enthusiasm! I composed a folk song on the spot:

    Zhang Fei roared,
    River water flowed backward,
    Scaring Cao Cao,
    Who hurriedly gathered his troops;
    We shouted "Ah-ho!",
    Earth shook and mountains swayed,
    Clear reservoirs,
    Flew up the mountainside,
    Barren hills became rice fields,
    Planting rice in the white clouds!

    From then on, I used folk songs to inspire everyone's labor enthusiasm, and labor provided me with rich content for creation. In this way, labor – creation – labor – creation, truly, even if the forest were the pen and the sky the paper, it could not be written exhaustively.

    There are so many things to write about, what should I write? This is how I did it: whatever the Party's political movement was, I wrote about it; whatever we did, I wrote about it. I not only participated in labor, but also actively responded to the Party's call, resolutely implementing the Party's policies. For example, when the Party called on us to plant more double-cropping rice, I took the lead in planting it, not only on the plains but also on the high mountains where double-cropping rice had never been planted before. At that time, some right-leaning conservatives said we were "toads wanting to eat swan meat" and even broke gongs to disrupt us. We did not listen to them, resolutely listened to the Party, and did what the Party told us to do, and as a result, we had a bumper harvest. On the day of the harvest, everyone smiled, and their energy soared. While reaping the rice, I looked at everyone's joyous mood and the scene of the harvest, and I casually composed a song:

    The sky is a straw hat, white clouds are an apron,
    Sickles rustle, rice stubble falls,
    Grain is sent down the mountain, carts squeak,
    People laugh on the mountain, songs float in the clouds.

    Once, we delivered fertilizer in the face of a strong north wind, running very fast, and I casually composed a song:

    Handcart delivers fertilizer,
    North wind races with me,
    I laugh heartily in front,
    The wind roars angrily behind.

    At the same time, participating in such labor also changed my thoughts and feelings. When delivering fertilizer, I said to the branch secretary: "Secretary, the north wind is too strong, it's really freezing!" The branch secretary said:

  "It doesn't matter if we are cold, we are just afraid of damaging the wheat." When the fertilizer was almost delivered, I said to the branch secretary: "Secretary, let's go back and warm ourselves by the fire after we finish delivering the fertilizer." The branch secretary said: "We can't warm ourselves by the fire, we have to put the fertilizer around the wheat seedlings to protect them." After we finished applying the fertilizer, I said again: "Secretary, can we go back and warm ourselves by the fire now?" The branch secretary said: "We have finished applying the fertilizer in our team, but other teams haven't finished yet. We should share blessings and share disasters, let's help other teams!" Obviously, our conversation completely expressed two different thoughts and feelings. Of course, I must learn from him. In the process of often working with him, my thoughts and feelings gradually became one with him.

    Participating in labor can increase production knowledge and familiarity with production technology. Although I have been laboring in the countryside for more than twenty years and have learned to do many farm works, there are still some works that I can't do, especially new production technologies. Once, I wrote a novel called "Fishing," and after finishing it, I asked the fishermen comrades for their opinions. They said: "I can't offer any other opinions, but there is only one opinion: singing folk songs to catch fish, this is not in line with the facts, because fish are very smart, and they will run away as soon as they hear singing. When we go fishing, we are always silent, and even if we need to say a few words, we are quiet." Thank goodness, I was fortunate to ask them for their opinions on this manuscript first, otherwise, I would have made a fool of myself. I also felt that just asking like this could not solve the problem, I had to go fishing with them. In fishing, I learned a lot of knowledge: how to row, how to cast a net, how to observe fish waves, how to collect a net... Don't look down on these technical issues, these techniques best express a fisherman's experience and resourcefulness, making the character's spiritual outlook more full.

    In labor, new people and new things emerge endlessly. Last year, when we were engaged in "double-rush" [harvesting and planting], I was responsible for the work of a work group and guaranteed to the superiors that we would complete the task in ten days. This task was arduous. To complete this task, the masses not only worked hard and practically but also cleverly. In particular, our Party Branch Secretary (she is a female comrade), every time she came, she either carried a load of herbal tea or a load of food, often carrying medicines such as cooling oil, renshen pills, and yipiantian, and also brought two bamboo clappers. During breaks, she gave us kuaiban performances, singing about the heroic figures in the double-rush, which not only entertained us but also educated us. We were afraid that we would not be able to complete the task in time and requested to work at night several times, but she firmly refused. But she was very concerned about production. Every time she came, in addition to observing carefully, she also asked us if we had any difficulties and problems, and we said no. Who knew she ran around everywhere and found many problems: whose rice straw was not threshed cleanly, who dropped grain when threshing, the cafeteria could reduce one labor force... The problems she pointed out were all problems that needed to be solved urgently. Why didn't I find them when I was here every day? Because I didn't work deeply enough. Our Branch Secretary is just one of the thousands of cadres, and I sincerely admire them and love them. Only by learning from them, learning from them in labor, and learning from them in the fierce struggle can we shape vivid characters.

    One day, when we were threshing rice enthusiastically, the Branch Secretary ran over. She grabbed the hand of the young woman Wang Guiying and said, "Guiying, why are you also here in this paddy field reaping rice?" Wang Guiying said, "Secretary, the double-rush is like抢宝 [snatching treasure - can also mean a period of intense activity], why can't I be here reaping rice?" The Secretary pointed at Wang Guiying's nose seriously and kindly and said, "You, turtle eating fireflies, you know it in your heart, you..." Wang Guiying's face suddenly turned crimson. The Branch Secretary seemed to give an order: "Guiying, you hurry back to dry the grain, and come to this paddy field in three or four days to work. Go!" Guiying had no choice but to obey obediently. Look! Our Branch Secretary cares about the lives of the masses to such a deep extent!

    Everyone felt that since the Party cares about us so much, we should put in even greater effort to repay the Party. As a result, we completed the task three days ahead of schedule. The Branch Secretary's fine work style moved me, and the soaring enthusiasm of the masses moved me, so I wrote a novel with the double-rush as the theme.

    As for the time issue, although the countryside is very busy now, there is still a certain amount of rest time. In general, there are four or five hours a day to read or write. Some people say that these four or five hours should be used for good rest. I think: if you don't carry on your shoulders, don't lift with your hands, don't run with your feet, sit down and read or write, isn't this rest? If you strain your brain in these few hours and then work hard, your brain won't hurt; if you are tired from working hard, sit down and read or write, and you won't be tired again. Using brainpower and physical strength interchangeably will not damage your brain or tire your body; it is both labor and rest. In this way, you rarely get sick. I rarely get sick!

    I deeply realize that the Party's literary and art policy of "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving the socialist cause" and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" are very correct. People like us who knead mud can not only enjoy literature and art but also write books. I am not saying that I am a writer, but that writers have already emerged from our workers, peasants, and soldiers. We resolutely support this policy. Labor is forever the source of creation, and I want to labor in the countryside for the rest of my life.

### 劳动永远是创作的源泉

    劳动永远是创作的源泉	刘勇
    我是个很普通的农民。解放前给地主放过牛，日子过得比黄连还苦；解放后才在夜校学习文化，到1952年下半年，开始学习写稿了。
    在党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们分到了田地房屋，第一次在自己的田地上劳动的时候，心里乐得开了花。我们把田地当成了宝贝，深耕细作，多施肥料，多打粮食，建设我们的新农村。在劳动中出现了很多英雄模范，我和他们一起劳动，我很爱他们。这时候，我产生了这样一种想法：如果我能编些山歌把心里的快乐唱出来，把大家的劳动热情唱出来，那多好啊！我把我的想法告诉我们的王区委，王区委热情地鼓励我，跟我谈农村的发展前途，又送我到县里的干部训练班学习，使我懂得了很多翻身的道理，看清了农村的发展前途。有一天，我们在山上开荒时，就编了一首山歌：
    想起翻身爱唱歌，
    歌声震动荒山坡，
    千锄万锄开荒土，
    到处都把种子播，
    建设我们新农村，
    子子孙孙幸福多。
    这样的山歌一唱起来，更加鼓舞了大家的劳动热情和斗争意志。旱田没有水，大家就在山上开了塘，千年的荒地，开成了水田，那股子干劲多大呀！我就地编了一首山歌：
    张飞大吼一声，
    河水倒流，
    吓的曹操，
    忙把兵收；
    我们一声啊嗬，
    地动山摇，
    清清水库，
    飞上山腰，
    荒山变禾，
    白云里种稻！
    从此，我就利用山歌鼓舞大家的劳动热情，劳动又给我创作提供了丰富的内容。就这样，劳动——创作——劳动——创作，真是森林当笔天当纸也是写不完的。
    可以写的东西那么多，写什么？我是这样做的：党的政治运动是什么，我就写什么；干什么，就写什么。我不仅参加劳动，而且积极响应党的号召，坚决贯彻执行党的方针、政策。例如党号召我们多种双季稻，我就带头种，不仅在平原种，而且在从来没有种过双季稻的高山上也种了。当时有些右倾保守分子说我们是“野猫子想得天鹅肉吃”，并且打破锣，我们没有听他们的，坚决听党的话，照着党所说的去做，结果获得了大丰收。收割的那一天，大家笑逐颜开，干劲冲天，我一面割禾，一面看了看大家的喜悦情绪，又看了看那丰收的场面，就随口编了一首：
    当天是草帽，白云是围腰，
    镰刀嚓嚓响，禾蔸唰唰倒，
    谷往山下送，车子唧唧叫，
    人在山上笑，歌声云里飘。
    有一次，我们冒着大北风送肥料，跑得飞快，随口就编了一首：
    手推车子送肥料，
    北风和我来赛跑，
    我在前面呵呵笑，
    风儿气得呼呼叫。
    同时，参加这样的劳动也改变了我的思想感情。在送肥料的时候我对支书这样说：“支书，北风刮得太大了，真是冷死人！”支书说：
  “我们自己冷没有关系，就是怕把麦子吹坏了。”肥料快送完了，我对支书说：“支书，我们送完肥料就回去烤火吧。”支书说：“不能烤火，要把肥料培在麦蔸蔸旁边，保护麦苗。”我们把肥料培完了，我又说：“支书，这回我们可以回去烤火了吧？”支书说：“我们队的培完了，别队的还没有培完，我们要有福同享，有灾同当，帮别队去培吧！”很明显，我们两人的谈话，完全表现了两种不同的思想感情。当然，我要好好向他学习。在经常和他一起劳动的过程中，我的思想感情逐渐和他打成一片了。
    参加劳动，能增加生产知识和熟悉生产技术。我虽然在农村劳动有二十多年了，学会了干很多农活，但还是有些活不会干，特别是新的生产技术。有一次，我写了一篇《捞鱼》的小说，写完请渔民同志提意见。他们说：“别的意见我提不出来，只有一个意见：唱起山歌去捞鱼，这不合乎事实，因为鱼最精灵，它一听到歌声都跑光了。我们去捞鱼的时候总是不声不响的，即使需要说两句话，也是小声小气的。”谢天谢地，我多亏把这个稿子先请他们提意见，否则就要闹出笑话来。我又觉得光是这样问一下还不能解决问题，必须跟他们一道去捞鱼。在捞鱼中，我学会了很多知识：如何划桨，如何撒网，如何观察鱼浪，如何收网……别看这都是一些技术问题，这些技术就最能表现一个渔民的老练、机智，使人物的精神面貌更加丰满了。
    在劳动中，新人新事真是层出不穷。去年搞双抢的时候，我负责一个作业组的工作，向上级保证十天完成任务。这个任务是艰巨的，为了完成这项任务，群众不但实干苦干而且巧干。特别是我们的党总支书记（她是个女同志），每次来的时候，不是挑一担凉茶，就是挑一担饭菜，身上经常带了清凉油、人丹、一片丹等药品，还带了两块竹板板，休息时给我们唱快板，唱的尽是双抢中的英雄人物，既使我们得到了娱乐，又使我们受到了教育。我们生怕不能及时完成任务，几次请求出夜工，她坚决不肯，但她对生产又非常关心，每次来的时候，除了仔细地观察外，还问我们有没有困难和问题，我们说没有。谁知她到处跑一圈，问题不少，谁的禾把没有打干净，谁打禾掉了谷子，食堂里还可以减少一个劳动力……她指出的这些问题，都是急待解决的问题，我天天在这里为什么没有发现？因为我工作不深入。我们的总支书记仅仅是千千万万干部中的一个，我真从心眼里佩服他们，敬爱他们，只有好好向他们学习，从劳动中向他们学习，从激烈的斗争中向他们学习，才能塑造出活生生的人物形象来。
    有一天，我们打禾打得很起劲的时候，总支书记跑来了。她一把揪住青年妇女王桂英的手，说：“桂英，你怎么也在这水田里割禾？”王桂英说：“书记，双抢如抢宝，我为什么不能在这里割禾？”书记指着王桂英的鼻子严肃而又亲切地说：“你呀，乌龟吃萤火虫，自己心里明白，上个月这几天你……”王桂英的脸一下子就涨得绯红。总支书记好像下命令一样说：“桂英，你赶快回去晒谷，过三、四天再到这水田里来搞。走吧！”桂英只好服服贴贴地走了。看呀！我们的总支书记关心群众生活，到了多么深切的程度啊！
    大家觉得党这样关心我们，我们就要拿出更大的干劲来，报答党，结果提前三天完成了任务。总支书记那种优良的工作作风感动了我，群众的冲天干劲感动了我，我就以双抢为题材写出了一篇小说。
    至于时间问题，现在农村虽然很忙，但还是有一定的休息时间。在一般情况下每天有四、五小时来看书或写东西。有人说，这四、五小时就应该很好的休息休息，我觉得：肩不要挑，手不要提了，脚不要跑了，坐下来看看书或写一写，这不是休息又是什么？这几个小时如果把脑筋用痛了，去猛干一场，脑筋就不痛了；猛干一场如果累了，坐下来看看书或写写，又不累了。脑力与体力交换使用，既不会用坏脑筋，也不会累坏身体；既是劳动，又是休息。这样一来，很少生病。我就很少生过病！
    我深深体会到：党提出的“为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务”的文艺方针，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策是非常正确的。像我们这样一些搓泥巴坨的，不仅是文学艺术的享受者，而且还能著书立说了。我不是说我是个作家，而是说我们工农兵中已经出现了作家。我们坚决拥护这个方针、政策。劳动永远是创作的源泉，我要在农村劳动一辈子。
