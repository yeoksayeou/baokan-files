Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 29th: Vientiane News: The extremely pro-American and reactionary Phoumi Nosavan clique in Laos, instigated and supported by U.S. imperialism and its lackey Thailand, is stepping up its activities to subvert the legitimate government of Laos.

According to an Associated Press report on the 28th, Phoumi Nosavan, through his so-called spokesman, claimed on the 28th that a "new legitimate government" would be organized after all members of the National Assembly met in Luang Prabang. The Associated Press said, "Phoumi Nosavan will certainly play an important role in the government and continue to maintain his position as a powerful figure in Laos."

The Associated Press report also said that before deciding that members of the Lao National Assembly would go to Luang Prabang to "meet," Phoumi Nosavan and General Commander of the Lao Royal Army, Kouprasith Abhay, had negotiated by radio.

According to United Press International, Phoumi Nosavan put forward some unreasonable conditions, including: Captain Kong Le and the 2nd Parachute Battalion will withdraw from Vientiane; the weapons distributed to the broad masses of residents to resist the attack of Phoumi's troops will be recovered; the actions of the National Assembly after August 9 will be denied, and the legitimacy of the Phouma government will be denied, saying that the Phouma government can only be regarded as a "temporary government established from an administrative point of view." And the National Assembly will meet in Luang Prabang to discuss "the issue of organizing the government."

The Associated Press even clamored that, in the worst case, Kong Le might be brought to a military court for trial. The news agency said that Phoumi Nosavan had said earlier that doing so was a "normal military procedure."

Prior to this, another head of the pro-American reactionary clique in Laos, former Foreign Minister of the Somsanith government, Khamphan Panya, carried out several days of active activities in Bangkok. According to the Associated Press, Panya met with Thai Acting Foreign Minister Charoonchai and Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat in Bangkok; and met with the American, British, and French ambassadors to Thailand. He also held a short meeting with Phoumi Nosavan before going to Bangkok.

According to a broadcast by Vientiane Radio today, all members of the Lao National Assembly, as well as members of the Phouma government and the former Somsanith government, went to Luang Prabang this morning.

According to Reuters, Lao Prime Minister Phouma said at a press conference on the 27th that he and the members of the National Assembly in Vientiane would go to Luang Prabang to meet with the other twenty members of parliament with Phoumi Nosavan to "discuss the issue of organizing a permanent government."

Phouma said, "In any case, the cabinet will probably undergo some reorganization." He also said that he was willing to accept the National Assembly's vote on his future as Prime Minister.

According to Reuters, Phouma said before leaving Vientiane for Luang Prabang that Laos still faces the danger of civil war.

Reuters also reported that Captain Kong Le told reporters on the 27th that if the new government does not implement the neutral policy required by the coup committee, he will rise up and "overthrow that government."

It is reported that the Lao people are closely watching the development and changes in the situation.

    在美帝国主义和泰国的支持下
    老挝诺萨万集团加紧复辟活动
    万象电台说国民议会将在琅勃拉邦讨论改组政府问题
    新华社河内29日电　万象消息：老挝极端亲美反动的富米·诺萨万集团在美帝国主义及其走狗泰国的唆使和支持下，加紧进行颠复老挝合法政府的活动。
    据美联社28日报道，富米·诺萨万通过他的所谓发言人28日扬言，在国民议会全体议员在琅勃拉邦开会后，将组织一个“新的合法政府”。美联社说，“富米·诺萨万一定会在政府内起重要作用，继续保持老挝强有力人物的地位。”
    美联社的这则消息还说，在决定老挝国民议会议员等到琅勃拉邦去“开会”以前，富米·诺萨万和老挝王国军队总司令拉迪功曾经通过无线电进行了谈判。
    据合众国际社报道，富米·诺萨万提出了一些无理的条件，包括：贡勒大尉和伞兵第二营将撤出万象；把为了抵抗富米军队的进攻而发给广大居民的武器收回；否认国民议会在8月9日以后的行动，否认富马政府的合法性，说只能认为富马政府是“从行政观点出发而成立的临时政府”。并且国民议会将在琅勃拉邦开会讨论“组织政府的问题”。
    美联社甚至叫嚣说，在最坏的情况下，贡勒可能要被提交军事法庭审判。这家通讯社说，富米·诺萨万早些时候曾说这样做是“正常的军事程序”。
    在这以前，老挝亲美反动集团的另一头子，前松萨尼特政府外交大臣坎番·班雅到曼谷进行了几天积极的活动。据美联社报道，班雅在曼谷曾经会见了泰国代理外交部长乍龙猜和泰国总理乃沙立；并且会见了美国、英国、法国驻泰国的大使。在他到曼谷以前还曾和富米·诺萨万举行了短时间的会谈。
    据万象电台今天广播，老挝国民议会全体议员，以及富马政府和前松萨尼特政府的成员今天上午已前往琅勃拉邦。
    据路透社报道，老挝首相富马在27日举行的一次记者招待会上说，他和在万象的国民议会议员将去琅勃拉邦和同富米·诺萨万一起的其他二十名议员会谈，“讨论组织一个常任政府的问题。”
    富马说，“无论如何，内阁大概会进行一些改组。”他还说，他愿意接受国民议会对于他担任首相的前途所进行的表决。
    据路透社消息，富马离万象到琅勃拉邦去之前说，老挝依然存在发生内战的危险。
    路透社还报道，贡勒大尉27日向记者说，假如新政府不执行政变委员会所要求的中立政策的话，他将起来“推翻那个政府”。
    据报道，老挝人民正在密切注视着局势的发展和变化。
