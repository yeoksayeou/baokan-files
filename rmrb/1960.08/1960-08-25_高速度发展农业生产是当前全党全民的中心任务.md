    High-Speed Development of Agricultural Production is the Central Task of the Entire Party and All the People
    Hu Kaiming, First Secretary of the CPC Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee
    Accelerating the Development of Agricultural Production is the Most Urgent Central Task
    The guideline of taking agriculture as the foundation, industry as the leading factor, prioritizing the development of heavy industry in combination with the rapid development of agriculture is a profound revelation and scientific summary of the laws of socialist economic development by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and a major development of Marxist political economy. Implementing this guideline has great practical significance and long-term guiding significance for ensuring the comprehensive and sustained leap forward in China's socialist construction.
    China is a large agricultural country, with the rural population accounting for 80% of the national population. Before liberation, agricultural production methods were backward and production levels were very low. At present, although the countryside already has a collective ownership system that is relatively close to the system of ownership by the whole people, and agricultural productivity has greatly improved compared to before liberation, the overall technical level of agriculture is still quite backward. Under these circumstances, accelerating the development of agricultural production is of particularly important significance. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The situation of the peasants is of great importance to the economic development and the consolidation of the political power in our country." Ten years of practice have proved that good agricultural harvests can better meet the needs of all aspects of the national economy and promote the rapid development of socialist construction. This shows that taking agriculture as the foundation is our long-term and correct guiding principle for building socialism.
    With the continuous and comprehensive leap forward of the national economy, the development of agriculture has become a key issue for the national economy to continue its leap forward. This is because the grain, raw materials, and labor force that agriculture can provide are no longer sufficient to meet the growing needs of industry and other undertakings. This is the main contradiction in China's current national economy. Therefore, grasping this main contradiction and solving it as soon as possible is currently the most urgent central task for the entire party and all the people.
    All Trades and Industries Must Consciously, Comprehensively, and Regularly Serve Agriculture
    To ensure the realization of the arduous task of accelerating agricultural development, the first thing needed is for all departments, all trades and industries, to firmly establish the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation and agriculture as the center, so that supporting agriculture becomes a comprehensive and conscious action. Most people now have a relatively deep understanding of this point. Zhangjiakou area has also achieved great results in supporting agriculture. But not everyone has a sufficient understanding yet. Some people equate taking agriculture as the foundation with slowing down industrialization, believing that this will slow down the pace of industrialization, and do not actively and voluntarily serve agriculture, or they regard it as an extra burden, something for other departments to do.
    It should be seen that the development of all sectors of the national economy is not isolated from each other, but closely linked and always developing unevenly. Our task is to be good at understanding and mastering the laws of national economic development, constantly grasping the weak links and main contradictions in national economic development, and adjusting them in a timely manner to promote relative balance. Heavy industry, because it produces the means of production, and because of its inherent advanced nature, often plays a leading role in the development of the national economy and occupies a priority position in socialist construction. However, when agriculture is still relatively backward, it is entirely necessary and correct for us to actively take the development of agriculture as the central task for a current period. Especially in our Zhangjiakou area, the area is vast and sparsely populated, the frost-free period is short, and the historical level of agriculture is relatively backward. Currently, mechanized farming area only accounts for 2% of arable land, irrigated land only accounts for about 30% of arable land, and the average grain yield per mu is still far from the National Program for Agricultural Development. At the same time, with the comprehensive leap forward of the national economy in recent years, more rural labor has been exported, with an average of forty-one mu of cultivated land per laborer. It is not difficult to imagine that if this situation is not changed quickly, the result will not only affect the speed of industrial development, but the entire national economy will not be able to develop normally. Now, our emphasis on agriculture is precisely to promote this weak link to catch up as soon as possible. This is of great strategic significance for ensuring the national economy continues to develop at a higher speed and in proportion. Since this is the case, then all trades and industries supporting agriculture are not an extra burden at all, but a task within their own responsibilities; it is not just the inherent task of a certain front or certain departments, but the common responsibility of all fronts and all departments. If we did not have the subjective conditions and objective basis for cities to comprehensively support the countryside and industry to vigorously arm agriculture in the past, then now, with the strengthening of industrial production and material and technical foundations, and with the establishment and consolidation of rural people's communes, the time has come. Therefore, we must firmly establish the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, proceed from the goal of benefiting the development of agriculture in everything, regardless of industry, regardless of size, do our best, strive to be the first, actively and consciously, do everything possible to serve agriculture, and quickly push the movement to comprehensively support agriculture to a new climax.
    Closely Arrange and Carry out All Work Around the Development of Agriculture
    Taking agriculture as the foundation means elevating the development of agriculture to the primary position in our work. This requires party and government leading organs at all levels to truly place the focus of leadership on agriculture and focus their main energy on grasping agriculture; it requires all departments to clearly establish the viewpoint of taking agriculture as the foundation, so that all work is closely centered around agricultural production. At present, some places and some departments misunderstand the comprehensive leap forward and simultaneous advancement of all sectors of the national economy as simultaneous advancement of all work. They often start from a department or a front, and demand that their work be listed as the center, ranked in front, and also demand mobilizing the entire party and all the people to go all out. There are also some departments that, subjectively, are also proceeding from the benefit of agriculture, but their actions often contradict agricultural production. For example, some departments want to carry out literacy campaigns in the busy farming season, and some departments mobilize a large number of migrant workers to build roads during the busy farming season... Although their starting points are all to cooperate with agricultural production, the actual result is hindering agriculture. This phenomenon of simultaneous advancement reflects that some comrades have not yet truly implemented the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation in practice, have not understood the importance of concentrating forces to solve the main contradictions for promoting the overall situation, and also reflects that there are still problems of unclear priorities and detachment from reality in our guiding work. It should be seen that taking agriculture as the foundation does not exclude the comprehensive leap forward of all undertakings; on the contrary, it is precisely to ensure a greater and more comprehensive leap forward of all undertakings. Only when all undertakings are carried out in a planned and proportionate manner under the premise of ensuring that agriculture, this foundation, is consolidated and developed, can a true comprehensive leap forward be achieved. Otherwise, it will inevitably disperse forces, squeeze the center, and make it difficult for all work to develop smoothly. Therefore, we must oppose and overcome various forms of departmentalism and decentralism. In terms of organizational leadership, the first requirement is for party committees at all levels to further strengthen the collective leadership of agricultural production. In addition to the first secretary focusing on agriculture, other secretaries must also first focus on agriculture in their respective work. Only in this way can we prevent the tendency of dividing troops to guard the passes and give play to the command role of the party committee.
    Secondly, in terms of work layout, we must also list the development of agricultural production as the first priority according to the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, and make the work of other departments develop correspondingly and appropriately under the premise of obeying and serving agriculture. Within the agricultural front, we should also resolutely implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and taking grain as the key link, correctly handle the relationship between agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and correctly arrange current production and basic agricultural construction. Because grain is the foundation of our survival and the foundation of agriculture, only with the continuous increase of grain can we guarantee the better development of various productions in rural areas and even all undertakings in the country. At present, some communes and teams still have the phenomenon of valuing income over grain, which means they do not understand the importance of grain. We must regard grasping grain as a fundamental issue in socialist construction and agricultural production, and oppose and overcome the erroneous view of only paying attention to income and ignoring grain. We must appropriately and comprehensively develop diversified operations under the principle of ensuring the priority growth of grain and major industrial raw materials. What needs to be particularly noted here is that rural infrastructure construction such as water conservancy must obey the needs of current agricultural production, and be arranged in stages and batches under the premise of ensuring the manpower, financial resources, and materials required for current grain production. All non-productive construction must be strictly controlled. Even productive construction must be carried out within one's means, and cannot be all-encompassing, dispersing forces and hindering current production. In various farmland water conservancy constructions, we should also give priority to the agricultural benefits of the current year, and strive for continuous leap forward on the basis of ensuring a bumper harvest in the current year.
    Maintain Sufficient Labor for Agriculture and Field Production
    People are the decisive factor in production; the distribution of labor is the concrete embodiment of the proportional arrangement of the national economy. At present, when agricultural production is still mainly manual labor, it is impossible to guarantee continuous leap forward without sufficient labor. Therefore, correctly solving the problem of labor distribution is not only one of the basic bases for our considering problems and carrying out planning work, but also a fundamental issue and main guarantee for realizing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and taking grain as the key link, and also an important symbol of whether this policy is well implemented. At present, the shortage of labor reflects the contradiction between the common development of agriculture and industry, commerce, culture, education, and other undertakings, and also reflects the contradiction between grain and other productions simultaneously promoted within agricultural production, as well as the contradiction between current production and basic construction. Under these circumstances, it is even more necessary to concentrate forces, not disperse forces; that is, first ensure the labor necessary for field production, and then arrange the proportion of labor in other aspects. Zhangjiakou area has a large area and a small population, and the proportion of heavy industry is relatively large. Therefore, our primary task is to ensure sufficient labor for agricultural production all year round while ensuring the needs of steel production, and to basically stabilize it within two or three years. The labor required in other aspects should generally be solved by tapping potential internally and adjusting each other, and no more personnel should be recruited from rural areas. It is necessary and positive to adhere to this policy at present. At present, many factories and mines still have labor potential to be tapped, and urban people's communes also have a large number of people who can be put into production. Therefore, resolutely implementing this policy will inevitably greatly promote the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement and the full utilization of urban labor.
    On the agricultural production front, the most labor should be concentrated on field production in order to ensure the production of grain and major industrial raw materials, realize the policy of taking grain as the key link, and thereby ensure the consolidation and development of agriculture, this foundation. Under the principle of ensuring the permanent basic production team in agriculture, we should then allocate the personnel of various specialties such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery in proportion. Under the condition of ensuring current production, the proportion of labor for basic farmland construction should be determined. It is necessary to streamline various non-productive personnel and rectify commune-run industries and service industries. In terms of livelihood and welfare, we should also strive to use less manpower and less main labor. At the same time, commune and team industrial production and sideline production, in addition to a part that must maintain year-round production, should implement the principle of doing more in slack farming seasons, doing less in busy farming seasons, stopping during busy periods, farming during busy periods, and working during slack periods. Even catering and raising personnel should strive to be "proficient in one skill and capable of many." In this way, it can be ensured that agricultural production has a large number of logistical teams, adapting to the busyness and leisure of farming seasons, flexibly allocating, and rushing back and forth. Shajiatun Production Team of Chaigoubu Commune in Huaian County, through six methods such as suspending some sideline productions, streamlining catering and raising personnel, implementing part-work and part-study, replacing men with women, raising personnel also taking care of field management, and rectifying nurseries to tap women's labor, increased the labor in field production from 52% to 74%; it not only greatly strengthened field management, but also the canteen, animal husbandry, and processing industry were not affected by this. Practice has proved that as long as we do everything possible to arrange reasonably and ensure that agriculture has sufficient labor, it can still be done.
    Of course, ensuring that agriculture has sufficient labor should not be understood as the more people engaged in agriculture, the better. On the contrary, our fundamental goal is to change the backward situation in which the majority of people are trapped in the production of grain, vegetables, and meat as soon as possible. We must first ensure the appropriate stability of current agricultural labor, and then actively use the existing labor and carry out technical transformation of agriculture to improve agricultural labor productivity, and export rural labor as much as possible when industrial development needs labor. At present, there are still phenomena of wasted working hours in rural areas of our region. Therefore, in addition to squeezing labor for agriculture from all aspects at present, we must also tap labor potential from within agriculture at the same time. Shibatatei Production Team of Koukou Nao Commune in Zhangbei County is a team with a large area and a small population, with an average of thirty-eight mu of cultivated land per full and semi-labor. However, because the cadres can conscientiously follow the mass line, take the lead in laboring, discuss farm work with the masses, and resolutely implement various policies such as distribution according to work, equivalent exchange, and on-time pre-distribution, and establish production responsibility systems and management systems such as work evaluation, point calculation, and three guarantees and one reward, greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses for production, achieving the dual advancement of field management and livestock raising. Now, there are an average of three and a half pigs, more than one sheep, and nearly half a large animal per person, and the crops are also growing very well. This is a very good example. At the same time, it is also necessary to actively carry out technical transformation, vigorously carry out tool reform, and conscientiously promote advanced technologies and tools that have been successfully tested, so as to continuously improve the level of agricultural production technology and improve agricultural labor productivity.
    Strengthen the Leadership in the Forefront of Agricultural Production
    Communes and production teams are the forefront of leading agricultural production and the basic combat units for implementing the Party's policies and guidelines. After communization, with the expansion of collective ownership and the improvement of the degree of collectivization of production and life, the tasks of the commune and team levels have become heavier and the work has become more complicated. They are managing a family as large as a district or a township in the past, managing the production and life of thousands or tens of thousands of households, and shouldering the leadership responsibility for comprehensively developing rural economic construction and cultural construction, and often have to deal with new problems that are much more complicated than in the past. But as far as the situation in Zhangjiakou area is concerned, the leadership strength of these two levels is still less than and weaker than that of the original district or township (compared with the coexistence of districts and townships). In order to strengthen the leadership in the forefront of agricultural production, we have generally promoted the "two-five system" leadership method, which has significantly improved the level of grass-roots leadership work. However, we must also make the greatest determination to streamline the upper-level agencies as much as possible, put more cadres and leading backbones into the grass roots, quickly strengthen the leadership strength in the forefront of agricultural production, so as to better realize the Party's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, further consolidate the rural people's communes, develop agricultural production at a high speed, and ensure the comprehensive and sustained leap forward of the national economy.

    高速度发展农业生产是当前全党全民的中心任务
    中共张家口市委第一书记　胡开明
    加速发展农业生产是当前
    最迫切的中心任务
    以农业为基础，以工业为主导，优先发展重工业同迅速发展农业相结合的方针，是党中央和毛泽东同志对社会主义经济发展规律的深刻揭示和科学总结，是马克思主义政治经济学的重大发展。贯彻执行这个方针，对于保证我国社会主义建设的全面、持续跃进，有着极大的现实意义和长远的指导作用。
    我国是一个农业大国，农村人口占全国人口的80％。解放前，农业的生产方式落后，生产水平很低。目前，农村虽然已经有了一个与全民所有制比较接近的集体所有制，农业生产率比解放前也有了很大的提高，但整个农业的技术水平，却还是相当落后的。在这种情况下，加速发展农业生产，就具有特殊重要的意义。正如毛泽东同志所指示的：“农民的情况如何，对于我国经济的发展和政权的巩固，关系极大”。十年来的实践证明：农业收成好，就能够更好地满足国民经济各方面的需要，促进社会主义建设迅速发展。这说明以农业为基础，是我们建设社会主义长远的正确的指导方针。
    随着国民经济不断地全面跃进，目前，农业的发展，已经成为国民经济向前继续跃进的关键问题。因为，农业所能提供的粮食、原料和劳动力等等，都已不能充分满足工业及其他事业日益增长的需要。这是我国当前国民经济中的主要矛盾，因此，抓住这个主要矛盾，尽快地解决它，就是目前全党全民最迫切的中心任务。
    各行各业要自觉地、全面地、经常地为农业服务
    保证实现加速发展农业的艰巨任务，首先需要所有部门、各行各业，坚定地树立起以农业为基础、以农业为中心的思想，使支援农业成为全面的自觉的行动。对于这一点，现在大多数人都已经有了比较深刻的体会。张家口地区支援农业的工作也取得了很大的成绩。但还不是所有的人都已有了足够的认识。有些人把以农业为基础同工业化对立起来，认为这样会放慢工业化的速度，而不积极地主动地为农业服务，或者把它看作是额外负担，是别的部门的事情。
    应当看到，国民经济各部门的发展都不是彼此孤立的，而是互相紧密联系，并且永远是不平衡地向前发展的。我们的任务就是要善于认识和掌握国民经济发展的规律，不断抓住国民经济发展中的薄弱环节、主要矛盾，及时地加以调整，促进相对的平衡。重工业由于它生产生产资料，由于它本身的先进性，所以就在国民经济的发展中，经常起着主导的作用，在社会主义建设中占优先地位。但是，当农业还相对落后的时候，我们主动地把发展农业作为当前一个时期的中心任务，也是完全必要的，正确的。特别是我们张家口地区，地广人稀，无霜期较短，历史上农业水平比较落后；现在，机耕面积只占宜耕地的2％，水浇地只占耕地面积的30％左右，粮食平均亩产量离农业发展纲要还差得很多。同时，几年来随着国民经济的全面跃进，农村劳动力输出较多，平均每个劳动力负担耕地高达四十一亩。不难设想，这种状况如不迅速改变，其结果不仅要影响工业的发展速度，而且整个国民经济也不能正常地发展下去。现在，我们突出地抓农业，正是为了促使这一薄弱环节尽快地赶上去。这对于保证国民经济更加高速度而按比例地继续发展，是有重大战略意义的。既然如此，那么各行各业支援农业，就完全不是什么额外负担，而是自己分内的任务；也不单单是某条战线、某些部门所固有的任务，而是一切战线、一切部门的共同职责。如果说，在过去我们还没有具备城市全面支援农村、工业大力武装农业的主观条件和客观基础，那么，现在随着工业生产和物质、技术基础的壮大，随着农村人民公社的建立与巩固，时候已经到来了。因此，我们必须坚定地树立起以农业为基础的思想，要一切从有利于发展农业的目标出发，不分行业，不分大小，各尽所能，争先恐后，积极自觉地、千方百计地为农业服务，迅速把全面支援农业的运动推向新的高潮。
    紧密围绕着农业的发展去安排和开展各项工作
    以农业为基础，就是把发展农业提到我们工作的首要地位。这就要求各级党政领导机关把领导重心切实放在农业上，以主要的精力来抓农业；要求一切部门明确树立起以农业为基础的观点，使各项工作都紧密围绕着农业生产去进行。目前有些地方、有些部门，把国民经济各部门的全面跃进和同时并举误解为各项工作的齐头并进。他们常常从一个部门或一条战线出发，要求把自己的工作列为中心，排在前面，而且都要求动员全党全民，全力以赴。还有些部门，他们主观上也是从有利于农业出发，但行动起来却往往同农业生产相矛盾。如有的部门要在农忙季节突击扫盲，有的部门在农忙期间发动大批民工修路……虽然他们的出发点都是为了配合农业生产，但是实际作的结果，却扯了农业的腿。这种齐头并进的现象，反映了一些同志还没有真正在实际上贯彻以农业为基础的方针，没有了解集中力量解决主要矛盾对于推动全盘的重要意义，也反映了在我们的指导工作上还存在着主次不明和脱离实际的毛病。应当看到：以农业为基础，并不排除各项事业的全面跃进，相反，正是为了保障各项事业更大更全面地跃进。各项事业只有在保证农业这个基础巩固起来、发展起来的前提下，进行有计划按比例的发展，才能实现真正的全面跃进。否则，就势必要分散力量，挤了中心，致使各项工作也都难以顺利发展。因此，我们必须反对与克服各种形式的本位主义和分散主义。在组织领导上，首先要求各级党委进一步加强对农业生产的集体领导。除了第一书记重点抓农业以外，其他书记，也必须首先围绕农业这个中心，来抓自己主管的工作。只有这样，才能防止分兵把口的倾向，发挥党委的统帅作用。
    其次，在工作布局上，也要根据以农业为基础的方针，把发展农业生产列为第一位，而使其他各部门的工作，都在服从并服务于农业的前提下，进行相应的适当的发展。在农业战线内部，也应当坚决执行以农业为基础和以粮为纲的方针，正确处理农业和林、牧、副、渔的关系，正确安排当前生产和农业基本建设。因为，粮食是我们生存之本，又是农业的基础，只有粮食不断地增长，才能保证农村中各项生产乃至全国各项事业的更好发展。目前有些社、队还存在着重收入轻粮食的现象，就是没有了解粮食的这种重要性。我们必须把抓好粮食当作社会主义建设和农业生产上的一个根本问题，反对与克服那种只注重收入而忽视粮食的错误观点。必须在确保粮食和主要工业原料优先增长的原则下，适当地全面发展多种经营。这里要特别提起注意的是，水利等农村基本建设必须服从当前农业生产的需要，在保证当前粮食生产所需的人力、财力、物力的前提下，分期、分批地进行安排。对于一切非生产性的建设，都要严加控制。就是生产性的建设，也要量力而为，不能万事俱兴，分散力量，妨碍当前生产。在各种农田水利建设方面，还应尽先考虑到当年的农业收益，务求在确保当年丰收的基础上持续跃进。
    保持农业和田间生产的足够的劳动力
    人是生产中的决定因素；劳动力的分布是国民经济安排比例的具体体现。目前农业生产还在以手工劳动为主的情况下，没有足够的劳动力，便无法保证持续跃进。因此，正确解决劳动力的分配问题，不但是我们考虑问题、进行计划工作的基本依据之一，而且是实现以农业为基础和以粮为纲的方针的一个根本问题和主要保证，也是这一方针贯彻得好与不好的重要标志。现在，劳动力的紧张，反映着农业同工业、商业、文教等其他事业共同发展的矛盾，也反映着农业生产内部粮食同其他生产同时并举的矛盾，以及当前生产同基本建设之间的矛盾。在这种情况下，就更加需要集中用兵，而不能分散用兵；即首先保证田间生产所必需的劳动力，而后安排其他方面劳动力的比例。张家口地区，地多人少，重工业的比重又较大。因此，我们的首要任务，就是在保证钢铁生产需要的同时，保证农业生产常年有足够的劳动力，并使之在两、三年内基本上稳定下来。其余各方面所需要的劳力，一般都要从内部挖掘潜力和互相调剂来解决，不再从农村招收人员。当前坚持这个方针是必需的，也是积极的。现在，许多厂矿企业中还有劳动潜力可挖，城市人民公社也还有大批人力可以投入生产。因而，坚决地执行这个方针，必然能够大大促进技术革新、技术革命运动的开展和城市劳动力的充分利用。
  在农业生产战线上，应当把最多的劳动力，集中于田间生产，以便保证粮食和主要工业原料的生产，实现以粮为纲的方针，从而保证农业这个基础的巩固与发展。在确保了农业常年的基本生产队伍的原则下，再按比例地去配备林、牧、副、渔等各种专业的人员。在保证当前生产的条件下，确定农田基本建设的劳力比例。要精简各种非生产性的人员，整顿社办工业和服务行业。生活福利方面，也要力求少用人，少用主要劳动力。与此同时，社、队的工业生产、副业生产除了一部分必须维持常年生产的以外，都要贯彻农闲多办、农忙少办、大忙停办、农忙务农、农闲做工的原则，就是炊事、饲养人员，也要力争“一专多能”。这样，就能保证使农业生产掌握有一大批后勤队伍，适应着农时的忙闲，灵活调配，来回突击。怀安县柴沟堡公社沙家屯生产队，通过暂停一些副业生产，精简炊事、饲养人员，实行半工半读，以女替男，饲养人员捎带田间管理，整顿托儿所挖掘妇女劳动力等六个办法，就使田间生产的劳动力由52％增加到74％；不仅大大加强了田间管理工作，而且食堂、畜牧、加工工业等也没有因此受到影响。实践证明，只要千方百计地去合理安排，保证农业有足够的劳动力，还是可以做到的。
    当然，保证农业有足够的劳动力，也不应理解为搞农业的人越多越好。恰恰相反，我们的根本目的，正是要尽快改变那种大多数人陷于粮食、蔬菜、肉类生产的落后状况。我们既要首先保证当前农业劳动力的适当稳定，又要积极地用好现有的劳动力，并进行农业的技术改造，提高农业劳动生产率，在工业发展需要劳力时，尽可能输出农村劳动力。现在我区农村中窝工浪费的现象还是有的。因而当前除从各方面给农业挤劳动力以外，还必须同时从农业内部挖掘劳动潜力。张北县对口淖公社什巴台生产小队，是个地多人少的队，每个整半劳动力平均负担三十八亩耕地。但由于干部能够认真地走群众路线，以身作则带头劳动，安排农活都和群众商量，并且坚决地执行了按劳分配、等价交换、按时预分等各项政策，建立了生产责任制和评工、计分、三包一奖等管理制度，大大地调动了群众的生产积极性和主动性，做到了田间管理和牲畜饲养双先进。现在，平均每人三头半猪、一只多羊和将近半个大牲畜，庄稼也长得很好。这就是一个很好的榜样。同时，还要积极进行技术改造，大搞工具改革，认真地推广那些已经试验成功的先进技术和工具，以便不断提高农业生产技术水平，提高农业劳动生产率。
    加强农业生产第一线的领导力量
    公社和生产队，是领导农业生产的第一线，是贯彻执行党的方针、政策的基本作战单位。公社化后，随着集体所有制的扩大和生产、生活集体化程度的提高，社、队两级的任务重了，工作更加复杂了。他们当着相当过去一个区、一个乡那么大的家，管理着上千户、上万户的生产和生活，担负着全面发展农村经济建设和文化建设的领导责任，要经常处理比过去复杂得多的新问题。但是就张家口地区的情况来说，这两级的领导力量，还少于和弱于原来的一个区、一个乡（同区、乡并存时比较）。为了加强农业生产第一线的领导，我们已经普遍推行了“二五制”的领导方法，使基层领导工作水平有了显著的提高。但是，我们还必须下最大决心，尽量精简上层机构，把更多的干部和领导骨干放到基层去，迅速把农业生产第一线的领导力量加强起来，从而更好地实现党的以农业为基础的方针，进一步巩固农村人民公社，高速度地发展农业生产，保证国民经济全面的持续跃进。
