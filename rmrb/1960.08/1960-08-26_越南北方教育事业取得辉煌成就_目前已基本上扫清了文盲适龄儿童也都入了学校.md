Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 23rd: Under the care and leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Republic's government, North Vietnam's education has achieved brilliant successes in the past fifteen years. Currently, North Vietnam has basically eliminated illiteracy, and almost all school-age children are enrolled in schools.

Compared with the school year 1939-1940, when the number of students was the highest during the French rule in Vietnam, the number of students in ordinary schools has increased more than thirty-four times, the number of university students has increased more than twelve times, and the number of students in secondary vocational schools has increased nineteen times.

After the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Labor Party attached great importance to education. Even in the extremely difficult years of the anti-French war, the Labor Party led the masses to persist in and develop education. After the restoration of peace, education developed rapidly. By the end of 1958, 93.4% of the original illiterate people aged 12 to 50 in the plains areas had been freed from illiteracy. On this basis, a widespread cultural advanced studies movement was launched. By June of this year, the number of people participating in cultural advanced studies at all levels had reached 1.5 million. The number of students in ordinary schools has developed to more than 1.52 million. At present, there are eight universities and thirty-seven secondary vocational schools in the North, with a total of 26,500 students.

It is particularly worth mentioning that the composition of students has also changed greatly in recent years. This year, students with worker and peasant backgrounds account for 40.71% of the total number of university students, and students with worker and peasant backgrounds account for 71.1% of the students in secondary vocational schools.

The development of education has provided a large number of cadres for economic construction and cultural development. At the same time, the teaching staff has expanded rapidly. When the French colonialists withdrew from the North, almost no professors were left in the universities. Now, with the vigorous training of the Labor Party and the government, there are more than 900 teachers teaching in universities, and the number of teachers in secondary vocational schools has also increased from more than 100 to more than 800. By the end of 1959, there were more than 35,500 teachers in ordinary schools.

The quality of education in Vietnam has also undergone fundamental changes. Shortly after the restoration of peace, the government changed the past twelve-year school system for primary and secondary schools to a ten-year continuous system, and all universities, middle and primary schools used the national language for teaching. At the same time, teaching syllabuses and new textbooks were compiled in accordance with the principles of building socialism. In 1958, the Labor Party put forward the educational policy of education serving politics, combining theory with practice, and combining education with productive labor. Under the guidance of this correct policy, schools at all levels have widely organized students to participate in collective labor and social political life, effectively strengthening political and ideological education, thus playing a huge role in cultivating students' Marxist-Leninist world outlook. In order to meet the needs of socialist construction, this year the Vietnamese government stipulated that the number of university admissions should increase by 4.6% compared with 1959, the number of secondary vocational schools should increase by 49.6%, and the number of students in ordinary schools should also increase greatly. This shows that education in North Vietnam will develop faster.

    越南北方教育事业取得辉煌成就
    目前已基本上扫清了文盲适龄儿童也都入了学校
    据新华社河内23日电　在越南劳动党和共和国政府的关怀和领导下，十五年来，越南北方的教育事业取得了辉煌的成就。目前，越南北方已基本上扫清了文盲，几乎所有的适龄儿童都入了学。
    越南北方同法国统治越南时期学生人数最高的1939—1940学年相比，普通学校学生人数增加了三十四倍多，大学生增加了十二倍多，中等专业学校的学生增加了十九倍。
    越南民主共和国成立后劳动党十分重视教育事业。即使在抗法战争极其艰苦的年月里，劳动党也领导群众坚持和发展教育。和平恢复后，教育事业获得了飞速的发展，到1958年年底，平原地区从十二岁到五十岁原来的文盲已有93.4％摆脱了文盲状态，并且在这一基础上，广泛地开展了文化进修运动，到今年6月，参加各级文化进修的人数已达一百五十万人。普通学校学生人数发展到一百五十二万多人，目前，全北方有大学八所，中等专业学校三十七所，学生共有二万六千五百人。
    特别值得提出的是，几年来，学生成分也有了很大改变。今年，各大学工农成分的学生占大学生总数的40.71％，中等专业学校中，工农成分的学生占71.1％。
    教育事业的发展，对经济建设和发展文化提供了大批干部。与此同时，教师队伍迅速扩大，在法国殖民者撤离北方时，大学中几乎没有留下教授，而现在，在劳动党和政府的大力培养下，在大学担任教学的教师已有了九百多人，中等专业学校教师也从一百余人增加到八百多人，普通学校教师到1959年底已达三万五千五百多人。
    越南的教育事业质量上也发生了根本变化。和平恢复后不久，政府就把过去中小学的学制由十二年改为十年一贯制，大中小学都用本国语言讲课。同时根据建设社会主义的原则，编订了教学大纲和新的教科书。1958年劳动党提出了教育为政治服务、理论与实际相结合、教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针。在这个正确方针指导下，各级学校广泛地组织学生参加集体劳动和社会政治生活，有力地加强了政治思想教育，因而对培养学生的马克思列宁主义世界观起了巨大作用。为了适应社会主义建设的需要，今年越南政府规定大学生录取额比1959年增加4.6％，中等专业学校增加49.6％，各普通学校的学生也大大增加。这显示着越南北方的教育事业将以更快的速度向前发展。
