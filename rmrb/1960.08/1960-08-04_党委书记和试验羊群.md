	Party Secretary and Experimental Sheep Herd Guo Jian
	In Dazhai Commune, Zhaotong County, Yunnan, the miracle of high yield created by the Party Secretary's experimental sheep herd is being spread: twenty-eight ewes produced seventy spring lambs this year, an average of two and a half lambs per ewe, of which seventeen produced three lambs, eight produced two lambs, and three ewe lambs of about one and a half years old also produced one lamb each. These lambs were all born healthy, all survived, and all were strong.
		
		Settling into the Sheepfold
	It was in June 1959 that Dazhai Commune held a livestock cadre meeting with herders participating, implementing the instructions of the higher party committee to develop animal husbandry at a high speed, and conducted a comparison of sheep herds throughout the commune. The evaluation found that the twenty-five age-appropriate ewes herded by herder Zhou Shunchang produced twenty-three lambs in the spring of 1959, of which three ewes produced three lambs and two produced two lambs. According to the local situation, it is rare for ewes to produce two lambs, let alone three in one litter. The herders, in excitement and amazement, asked Zhou Shunchang to introduce his experience in high yield sheep herding. However, Zhou Shunchang, who was from a poor peasant background, was so anxious that his face turned red and he could not say anything. He only stammered, "I don't know how they produce so many."
	The Party Committee decided to summarize and promote Zhou Shunchang's experience, and sent Party Secretary Zhao Yuancheng to conduct high-yield sheep herd experiments and be responsible for the overall work of the Chede Management Area. On the day he accepted the task, Zhao Yuancheng went straight to the First Production Team of the Chede Management Area, threw his backpack upstairs in the sheepfold, and went to the sheepfold with Zhou Shunchang.

		An Inspiration
	The summer noon was hot and sultry. The sheep herd that the commune had assigned to Zhou Shunchang to raise had returned early from grazing and were resting in the sheepfold, chewing on the green grass that Zhou Shunchang's family had cut in the morning. Zhao Yuancheng walked into the sheepfold, and a cool feeling swept through his body. The spacious sheepfold, the snow-white walls, the clean floor, and the open windows were more comfortable than Zhou Shunchang's upstairs sheepfold! Zhao Yuancheng stroked the plump lambs with affection and carefully observed them. He walked to the corner of the sheepfold and saw three adorable lambs rubbing and vying for milk beside a particularly plump and tall gray ewe. The three lambs were each of a different color: one black, one grayish-white, and one yellow. He raised a question for himself: "Why are the colors of the three lambs different from the color of their 'mother'?" He couldn't solve this "mystery" no matter how he looked at it. That night, sleeping upstairs in the sheepfold, he asked Zhou Shunchang this question. Old Zhou thought for a while and said, "Our three breeding rams are of this color, I'm afraid it's a matter of breeding." These two short sentences gave Zhao Yuancheng a great inspiration. He thought: If pigs are crossbred multiple times, they can produce high yields. Doesn't the fact that this mountain ewe produced three lambs in one litter also prove this? He thought of the ewes that produced two and three lambs that he had seen that day, which were always plumper than the ewes that produced one lamb, and these sheep were plumper than the other sheep he had seen. No wonder their conception rate was higher than other sheep herds. After thinking it over, he came to this conclusion: "Good condition is the basis of high yield, and breeding is the key to high yield." If all the sheep achieve a first-class condition and adopt multiple and repeated breeding methods, the lambing rate of ewes will be greatly increased, and sheep can develop at a high speed.

		High-Yield Experiment
	After he talked about this idea with Zhou Shunchang, the two began to conduct a high-yield sheep herd experiment. In addition to the original twenty-five age-appropriate ewes, the three ewe lambs that had just turned one and a half years old were included in the autumn mating plan last year. Each sheep was lined up according to their condition, and the thirteen relatively weak ewes were fed separately, with four ounces of refined feed added to each sheep every day, all boiled with salt water to stimulate appetite and quickly improve condition. After a month, all the ewes became first-class condition. In September, the ewes began to come into heat, which kept the Party Secretary busy. He went to the teams during the day to inspect and arrange production, and came early and late to breed the sheep, often so busy that he forgot to eat. Under his and Zhou Shunchang's careful care, each ewe was double-bred and repeatedly bred, each one accurately bred, and all conceived.

		Summarizing Management Experience
	Usually, when grazing, Zhao Yuancheng always brought his meals up the mountain like the herders. Zhou Shunchang's grazing ewes had no miscarriages or deaths, but he couldn't explain why he could do this. During grazing, Zhao Yuancheng helped him summarize the grazing experience of "four releases and four not releases": release on flat ground, not on steep ground; release near, not far; release slowly, not quickly; release widely, not narrowly.

	Once, while grazing, Zhao Yuancheng noticed that the ewes in good condition ran forward, eating and eating, while the ewes in poor condition fell behind, lazily eating a few bites of the gnawed grass and leaving. Similar situations occurred when feeding salt, with the strong ones rushing to eat and the thin ones not getting any. He thought: Sheep are most "picky," only eating the tips of the grass and clean grass, not eating grass that has been gnawed and trampled on. If this continues, the sheep in poor condition will not be full and will gradually become weak. So he and Old Zhou discussed dividing the sheep herd into strong and weak groups for grazing, and taking the method of cutting grass while grazing, bringing back one or two baskets of green grass every day to "add meals" to the sheep in poor condition, so that all the sheep could eat their fill, eat evenly, and grow strong.

	In order to reduce diseases in the sheep, he and Old Zhou changed the bedding of the sheepfold every three to five days and disinfected the sheepfold every ten days. In January this year, Zhao Yuancheng went to Yifei Management Area to inspect livestock work and found that the herder Zong Fatai had dug a ditch one meter wide and more than three inches deep inside the door of the sheepfold to create a "quarantine pit," sprinkled with lime and 666 powder. The sheep disinfected their hooves as soon as they entered the door, preventing the highly contagious and highly prevalent foot rot disease. After Zhao Yuancheng returned, he personally dug "quarantine pits" in all four sheepfolds with Zhou Shunchang.

		Before and After Lambing
	In early February this year, the time for lambing was not far away. Zhao Yuancheng and Old Zhou discussed using wild feed to improve the ewes' condition and promote milk production. At this time, kudzu vines had not yet sprouted leaves, which was when they had the most starch and were the most nutritious. The two of them went up the mountain to dig kudzu roots before dawn, and by the time they had breakfast, they carried back hundreds of catties. For nearly a month, they dug a total of more than two thousand catties of kudzu roots, which not only guaranteed that each sheep could eat one catty a day, but also stored two months' worth of concentrated feed. The ewes' lambing time was approaching, and they prepared scissors, iodine, cotton wool, and other obstetrical medicines and equipment, and asked the commune veterinarian to teach new methods of obstetrics. He and the herder often got up to patrol at night and watch the movements. Just then, the commune party committee notified Zhao Yuancheng to go on a business trip. He reluctantly bid farewell to Zhou Shunchang, repeatedly exhorting him, "Old Zhou, take good care of them, be sure to let the spring lambs survive and be strong." When he arrived at the commune, he also told the commune veterinarians to often take care of these sheep.

	In half a year, Zhou Shunchang learned many excellent qualities from Party Secretary Zhao Yuancheng, and he loved his sheep herd even more. One night, a ewe gave birth to lambs, and three lambs in a row came to the ground, each plump. He quickly took the ewe and the lambs to his room and placed them on the dry grass that had been laid in advance. His old partner was cooking sheep feed, and his eleven-year-old son was busy stoking the fire... By the time they called the ewe to eat and the lambs had eaten their milk, it was already dawn.

	March passed, and all the lambs had been born. They counted a total of seventy, an average of two and a half lambs per ewe, achieving full birth, full survival, and full strength. This made Old Zhou's family very happy and caused a sensation throughout the commune.

	The experimental sheep herd achieved a great harvest.

	In May, Zhao Yuancheng returned to the commune and ran to see his sheep herd in one breath. When he opened the sheepfold door, nearly a hundred sheep were returning from early grazing, resting in the sheepfold, and countless lambs were jumping and bouncing around the ewes, rubbing and feeding. Old Zhou told him that the twenty-eight ewes had been mated again in the spring and were striving to achieve "four hundred lambs from one hundred ewes" this year. Zhao Yuancheng excitedly grasped Old Zhou's hand tightly, and the two laughed happily.

### 党委书记和试验羊群

    党委书记和试验羊群	郭建
    在云南昭通县大寨公社里，传颂着党委书记的试验羊群创造高额丰产的奇迹：二十八只母羊，今年共产春羔七十只，平均每只产两只半，其中十七只产三羔、八只产双羔、三只一岁半左右的仔母羊也都各产一羔。这些小羊获得了全生、全活、全壮。
      到羊厩落户
    那是1959年6月的事，大寨公社召开了一次有饲养员参加的畜牧干部会，贯彻上级党委高速度发展畜牧业的指示，并对全社羊群进行了一次评比。评比中发现饲养员周顺昌放牧的二十五只适龄母羊，1959年春季产羔二十三只，其中有三只母羊产三羔，两只产双羔。按照当地的情况，母羊产双羔也是少有的事，何况一胎产下三只。饲养员们都以兴奋而又惊奇的心情，要周顺昌介绍他的羊群高产经验。可是，贫农出身的周顺昌急得脸红心跳，怎么也说不出来。他只结结巴巴地说了一句：“我也不晓得怎个会产那么多。”
    党委会决定好好总结和推广周顺昌的经验，派党委书记赵元成去搞丰产羊群试验，并负责车德管理区的全面工作。赵元成在接受任务的当天，就直奔车德管理区第一生产队，把背包向羊厩楼上一丢，就和周顺昌一起到羊厩里去。
      一个启示
    夏天的中午，炎热而烦闷。公社交给周顺昌负责饲养的羊群早牧归来，正在羊厩里乘凉，咀嚼着周顺昌一家人早上割回来的青草。赵元成走进羊厩，一股清凉的感觉袭透全身。宽敞的羊厩，雪白的粉墙，整洁的地面，洞开的窗户，比起周顺昌住的羊厩楼上，还要舒服！赵元成爱不释手地抚摩着一只只肥壮的小羊羔，仔细地观察着它们。他走到羊厩的角落里，看见有三只可爱的小羊在一只身体特别肥壮、高大的灰色母羊身边挤擦，争着吃奶。三只小羊各是一种颜色，一只黑色，一只灰白色，一只黄色。他给自己提出了一个问题：“为什么三只羊羔的毛色和它们的‘母亲’的毛色不一样？”他看来看去也解不了这个“谜”。晚上睡在羊厩楼上，他向周顺昌提出了这个问题。老周想了想说：“我们的三只种羊就是这样的毛色，怕是配种上的讲究。”短短的两句话，给赵元成以很大的启示。他想：猪多配复配，就能高产。这只山母羊一胎产三羔的事实，不也证实了吗？他联想到当天所看到的那些产两羔和三羔的母羊，身体总比产一羔的母羊要肥壮些，而这些羊群，比他所见到的其他羊群都要肥壮，难怪受胎率比其他的羊群高。想来想去，他得出了这样的结论：“膘力是高产的基础，配种是高产的关键。”如果所有的羊都实现一类膘，而且都采取多配、复配的办法，母羊的产羔率一定会大大提高，羊只便能来一个高速度的发展。
      丰产试验
    他把这个想法和周顺昌谈了以后，两人便着手进行丰产羊群试验。除了原有的二十五只适龄母羊外，又将刚满一岁半的三只仔母羊列入去年秋配计划。逐个进行膘力排队，将十三只比较瘦弱的母羊单独喂养，每天每只加精料四两，全用盐水煮熟了喂，既能促进食欲，催膘又快，一个月以后，全部母羊变成一类膘。9月间，母羊开始发情了，这可忙坏了党委书记，他白天到各队检查和布置生产，早晚赶来给羊群配种，经常忙得连饭都忘记吃。在他和周顺昌的精心照管下，每只母羊都实行了双配和复配，只只配准，全部受胎。
    总结管理经验
    平时放牧的时候，赵元成总是和饲养员一样，带饭上山。周顺昌放牧的母羊无流产无死亡，可是为什么能做到这一点，他却说不清楚。赵元成在放牧中帮助他总结了放平不放陡、放近不放远、放慢不放快、放宽不放窄等“四放四不放”的放牧母羊经验。
    有一次放牧时，赵元成发现膘力壮的母羊朝前跑，大吃特吃，而膘力较差的母羊落在后面，顺着被啃过的青草懒懒地吃了几口便走了；在喂盐时，也有类似情况，强的抢着吃，瘦的吃不到。他想：羊最“拣嘴”，只吃草尖和干净草，不吃啃过和踏过的草，照这样下去，膘力差的羊吃不饱，将逐步瘦弱下去。于是他和老周商量，将羊群按强弱分开放牧，并采取边放牧边割草的办法，每天带回一至二背青草，给膘力差的羊“加餐”，使只只羊都吃得饱，吃得均匀，长得壮。
    为了使羊只减少疾病，他和老周三至五天垫一次厩，十天进行一次厩舍消毒。今年1月，赵元成到以菲管理区检查畜牧工作，发现饲养员宗发泰的羊厩门内挖了个一公尺宽、三寸多深的
  “防疫坑”，里面撒上石灰和六六六粉，羊只进门就进行蹄子消毒，杜绝了传染性强、发病率高的烂蹄子病。赵元成回来后就亲自和周顺昌一起在四间厩舍内都挖了“防疫坑”。
      产羔前后
    今年2月初，离产羔的时间又不远了。赵元成和老周商量，要搞野生饲料为母羊催膘发奶。这时葛根还未发叶，正是淀粉最多、营养最丰富的时候，他俩天不亮就上山挖葛根，到吃早饭时，便背回百十来斤。将近一个月，共挖了二千多斤葛根，不仅保证每只羊每天吃到一斤，还储备了两个月的精饲料。羊的临产时间到来了，他们准备好剪刀、碘酒、药棉等接生药品、器械，并请公社兽医教会新法接生。他和饲养员经常起来巡夜，观看动静。就在这时，公社党委通知赵元成出差。他依依不舍地告别了周顺昌，再三叮咛说：“老周，好好照看它们，一定要让春羔只只成活、个个健壮”。到了公社，他又嘱咐公社兽医，要他们经常去关照这些羊群。
    半年时间，周顺昌从党委书记赵元成身上学到许多优良的品德，他更加爱护自己的羊群。一天晚上，一只母羊产羔了，接连三个小羊羔下地了，个个肥胖。他连忙把母羊和小羊抱到他的房间里，放在事先铺好的干草上，他老伴正在煮着羊食，十一岁的儿子忙着凑火……，等他们招呼母羊吃完食、羊羔吃了奶后，天已经亮了。
    3月过去了，羊羔下齐了。数了数共有七十只，平均每只母羊产羔两只半，达到了全生、全活、全壮。这可乐坏了老周一家，也轰动了全公社。
    试验羊群获得了大丰收。
      ×　×　×
    5月，赵元成回到公社，一口气跑去看他的羊群。当他打开厩门时，近百只羊正放早牧回来，在厩内乘凉，数不尽的小羊羔跳跳蹦蹦地在母羊身边挤擦、吃奶。老周告诉他：二十八只母羊又进行了春配，要力争今年实现“百母四百羔”。赵元成兴奋地紧紧握住老周的手，两人愉快地笑了。
