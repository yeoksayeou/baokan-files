Xinhua News Agency, August 20th—People from all circles in the capital held a grand rally this afternoon to warmly welcome the Zanzibar Nationalist Party delegation headed by Mirat Sherab Abdul, the Sierra Leone delegation headed by Ibrahim Kargbo, the delegation of the People's Liberation Movement of Angola under Portuguese rule, the delegation of the African Independence Party of Guinea-Bissau under Portuguese rule, and the Chairman of the Southwest African National Union, Kozonguizi, resolutely supporting the just struggle of the African people against imperialism, colonialism, and for independence and freedom.

These African foreign guests are all anti-imperialist, peace-loving fighters who have made unremitting efforts to win national independence for their countries and independence and freedom for the entire African people. Today, when they stepped onto the rostrum of the conference, they were warmly applauded by people from all walks of life in the capital.

Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, Liu Changsheng, President of the Chinese-African People’s Friendship Association, Xu Guangping, Vice President, Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People’s Committee for World Peace, Hu Yuzhi, Vice President of the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs, and Da Pungsheng, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association, attended the meeting.

Liu Changsheng, President of the Chinese-African People’s Friendship Association, spoke at the meeting, extending brotherly, militant respect to the entire African people who are fighting heroically for independence and freedom.

Liu Changsheng said: The Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and firmly supported the just struggle of the African people against imperialism and for national independence. He pointed out: The Chinese people extend their heartfelt congratulations to the heroic people of Zanzibar for the victory they have achieved in the anti-American struggle, and resolutely demand that all imperialist aggressive forces immediately get out of Zanzibar. The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the people of Sierra Leone and wish them an early victory in their struggle. The Chinese people resolutely demand that the Portuguese colonialists immediately stop the massacre and persecution of the people of Angola and Portuguese Guinea, and immediately release the imprisoned patriots. All imperialist forces must immediately get out of Angola and Portuguese Guinea. The Chinese people fully support the patriotic and just struggle of the people of Southwest Africa and resolutely support the struggle of the people of Southwest Africa to demand the abolition of the trusteeship of the Union of South Africa. We wish the people of Southwest Africa early independence and freedom.

Liu Changsheng said that the African national independence movement is developing vigorously and irresistibly, which greatly accelerates the overall collapse of the imperialist colonial system. However, imperialism will never be reconciled to giving up its colonial rule. In particular, American imperialism, under the guise of so-called "aid" and "friendship," is vigorously infiltrating Africa in all aspects in order to ultimately replace the old colonialist position and put the shackles of American neo-colonialism on the African people.

Liu Changsheng pointed out that American imperialism is not only the most ferocious enemy of the people of Asia and Latin America, but also the most ferocious enemy of the African people. The Chinese people fully believe that in the face of the heroic African people, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome and no enemies that cannot be defeated. The African people will surely unite as strong as steel and cause imperialism and colonialism to be smashed to pieces.

Liu Changsheng said that the Chinese people have suffered from long-term imperialist aggression and oppression in the past, and we share a common experience and destiny with the African people. Let us unite more closely, support each other, advance side by side, and fight together to completely defeat the aggression and oppression of imperialism and colonialism. The great unity and common struggle of the Chinese and African people will accelerate the failure and demise of imperialism in Asia, Africa, and the world.

Mirat Sherab Abdul, head of the Zanzibar Nationalist Party delegation, and member Bursara spoke, warmly praising the achievements of the Chinese people in construction, pointing out that the efforts of the Chinese people to build a new life and the great achievements they have made have made an indelible impression on the people of the world. They said that the wind blowing from the East has awakened the people of Asia and Africa from their slumber and wants to get rid of the chains that have bound and enslaved them for a long time. They said that as Chairman Mao said, imperialism is a paper tiger. As long as we unite and resolutely fight against imperialism, they will collapse like a house of cards.

In their speeches, they expressed the will of the Zanzibar people to strive for independence and freedom. They said that the people of Zanzibar believe that we would rather be poor and free than enjoy so-called prosperity by relying on the whims of imperialism. They said that the people of Zanzibar must restore the freedom they lost seventy years ago. They said that the Zanzibar Nationalist Party is fighting strongly against imperialism to liberate the country from slavery and rule this year.

They pointed out that imperialism is a threat to world peace today, and hundreds of millions of people on the African continent are engaged in the struggle against imperialism. They said that when British imperialism is about to roll out, American imperialism is trying to sneak in through the back door. The military bases of American imperialism in Zanzibar and around the world are a threat to world peace and reveal America's territorial ambitions in East and Central Africa. We want to say to imperialism: do not interfere in Africa; we want to say to the reactionaries and the running dogs of imperialism: your life is not long. They finally shouted: "Long live the unity and friendship of Asia and Africa!" "Down with imperialism!" "Freedom!"

Ibrahim Kargbo, head of the Sierra Leone delegation, cited a large number of facts in his speech to show that the people of Sierra Leone have never been subdued by the oppression of imperialism through its running dogs. He said that Africa is very eager to make real friends, friends who are not wolves in sheep's clothing, not imperialists who "fill the vacuum." He said that now everyone knows what the oppression and exploitation of Africa by imperialism is all about. Sierra Leone is determined to smash the oppression of imperialism and does not want any imperialist military bases in their country and throughout Africa.

He pointed out, "Africa's trust in China's friendship is due to China's enthusiasm for saving all oppressed people in the world without seeking China's own interests." He said that the development of China's Great Leap Forward is worth learning from in Africa.

The person in charge of the delegation of the People's Liberation Movement of Angola under Portuguese rule said in his speech that the ever-increasing and glorious anti-imperialist movement in Asia, Africa and Latin America has greatly promoted the struggle of the Angolan people. The increasing solidarity between the people of Asia and Africa and the peace-loving and freedom-loving people of the world exposes the weakness of the paper tiger of imperialism and makes our people confident that as long as we carry out the anti-imperialist struggle to the end, colonialism and imperialism will be wiped out in our time. The people of Angola are engaged in fierce battles to liberate themselves from Portuguese colonialism and to win complete independence. He said that the great Chinese revolution, the Great Leap Forward, and the unprecedented speed of development of New China are all invaluable contributions to the cause of peace and freedom for the people of the world.

The Chinese people have always been vigilant about the conspiracies of imperialism and have resolutely expressed their solidarity with the people who have been persecuted by imperialism. Like you, we are also making small and glorious efforts to prevent imperialism from hindering the Chinese people from leaping forward on the road to greater achievements.

The person in charge of the delegation of the African Independence Party of Guinea-Bissau under Portuguese rule said in his speech that the victories and vigilance that the Chinese people have achieved against imperialism and reactionary forces, as well as the construction work they are carrying out, are an inexhaustible source of encouragement and examples, and also an increasingly solid guarantee to strengthen our common struggle.

He said that the basic task of the historical period in which we live is to completely eliminate colonialism and imperialism. When the people of one country on the earth are still suffering from colonial rule and imperialist exploitation, there will be no real possibility of world peace. Our struggle cannot be relaxed, it should be more united and more combative day by day. Colonialism and imperialism will not give in without a struggle.

He exposed the crimes and conspiracies of the colonialists in their country. He said that we are vigilant in the face of the enemy. The nature of the enemy will not change unless it is completely eliminated. We are convinced that in today's world, colonial wars lead to the death of the colonialists. He said that our people and our party are determined to fight until complete and unconditional victory over Portuguese colonialism is achieved. He emphasized that the nature of imperialism will not change. If the nature of imperialism is to be changed by us, then it is to completely eliminate it. This is the task that history has left to the people of all countries and to our generation.

Kozonguizi, Chairman of the Southwest African National Union, said in his speech that imperialists, under the guise of "sympathizers," are preparing to undermine and sell out the freedom of our people. We will fight in every village and region of Southwest Africa. For this we need the support of all our friends and brothers all over the world.

He said that there is only one enemy in our common struggle, which carries out political rule, economic plunder, racial discrimination, economic aggression or other aggressive conspiracies. This enemy is imperialism, and its only characteristic is internationality.

He said that now, there is only one leader in the international aggression group, and the biggest enemy of our cause in politics or economy is the dollar. The dollar maintains many military bases on the European continent, and these bases enslave Africa. The dollar is responsible for the economic aggression suffered by Latin America. The dollar divides Asia and establishes military bases and espionage networks around the People's Republic of China. Therefore, our strength must be united, uniting the strength of all continents to fight. We must not only fight against imperialism, but also eliminate its puppets and running dogs. We must not only stop the tentacles of Washington, but also destroy it.

He denounced the bloody crimes of the colonialists in Southwest Africa, pointing out that the United Nations, manipulated by the United States, has failed to provide the slightest assistance to the struggle of the people of Southwest Africa, despite verbally shouting about justice and freedom.

He concluded by saying that our struggle belongs to the struggle of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Our struggle is combined with the struggle against the dollar. I assure you of my personal, the people of my country and the full support of our national union.

These speeches were warmly welcomed by the audience. After the speeches, the participants unanimously passed the resolution of the conference.

Today's conference was jointly held by the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, the Chinese-African People’s Friendship Association, and the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs. Heads of various people's organizations and people from all walks of life attended the meeting. Among them were: Kang Yonghe, Liu Qingyang, Mei Lanfang, Shu Sheyu, Pu Jiexu, Zhang Jie, Zhu Ziqi, Wang Mingyuan, Wu Qing, Wu Xiaoda, Guan Shixiong, Wang Yingpu, etc.

Xinhua News Agency, August 20th—The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, the Chinese-African People’s Friendship Association, and the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs held a reception this afternoon in the Great Hall of the People to welcome African foreign guests who are visiting our country. They are: the Zanzibar Nationalist Party delegation headed by Mirat Sherab Abdul, the Sierra Leone delegation headed by Ibrahim Kargbo, the People's Liberation Movement of Angola under Portuguese rule, the delegation of the African Independence Party of Guinea-Bissau under Portuguese rule, and the Chairman of the Southwest African National Union, Kozonguizi.

Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, delivered a speech at the reception. He said that the Chinese people have always stood, are standing, and will always stand with the African people and will always support the struggle of the African people.

Liu Ningyi said that the Chinese people and the African people have a common destiny and a common enemy. In the future, we will unite more closely, cooperate closely, support each other, and strive together against imperialism and colonialism, for the struggle and maintenance of national independence, and to defend world peace.

Liu Ningyi said that today the world's people's strength against imperialism is unprecedentedly strong, and the imperialist colonial system is rapidly moving towards collapse. This excellent situation is conducive to the struggle of the oppressed people for national liberation. We firmly believe that as long as the African people unite more closely and persist in the struggle, the final victory will surely belong to the heroic African people.

Liu Ningyi thanked the African friends for bringing their friendship to the Chinese people. And he hoped that they would bring the friendship of the Chinese people to all the African people. Liu Ningyi said that through the visit of African friends, the great friendship between the Chinese people and the African people will be further consolidated and developed.

Those who attended the reception included Liu Changsheng, President of the Chinese-African People’s Friendship Association, Xu Guangping, Vice President, Hu Yuzhi, Vice President of the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs, Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People’s Committee for World Peace, Da Pungsheng, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association, heads of various people's organizations and people from all walks of life Kang Yonghe, Liu Qingyang, Mei Lanfang, Shu Sheyu, etc.

    首都各界盛会欢迎非洲朋友支持非洲人民的正义斗争
    中国非洲人民并肩斗争加速帝国主义灭亡
    中国亚非团结委员会等单位举行酒会招待非洲贵宾
    新华社20日讯　首都各界人民今天下午举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎以米拉茨·谢拉布·阿卜杜勒为首的桑给巴尔民族主义党代表团、以依伯拉欣·卡尔格波为首的塞拉勒窝内代表团、葡属安哥拉人民解放运动代表团、葡属几内亚非洲独立党代表团及西南非洲民族联盟科章吉济主席，坚决支持非洲人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义和争取独立自由的正义斗争。
    这些非洲外宾，都是反对帝国主义、保卫和平的战士，他们为争取本国民族独立和为整个非洲人民争取独立自由的事业，作出了不懈的努力。今天，他们登上大会主席台的时候，受到首都各界人民热烈的鼓掌欢迎。
    中国亚非团结委员会副主席刘宁一，中国非洲人民友好协会会长刘长胜、副会长许广平，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席包尔汉，中国人民外交学会副会长胡愈之，中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生等，出席了大会。
    中国非洲人民友好协会会长刘长胜在大会上讲话，他向正在为争取独立自由而英勇斗争的整个非洲人民，致以兄弟的、战斗的敬意。
    刘长胜说：中国人民一贯深切同情和坚决支持非洲人民反对帝国主义、争取民族独立的正义斗争。他指出：中国人民对英勇的桑给巴尔人民在反美斗争中所取得的胜利表示衷心地祝贺，并坚决要求一切帝国主义侵略势力立即从桑给巴尔滚出去。中国人民坚决支持塞拉勒窝内人民的正义斗争，并祝他们的斗争早日取得胜利。中国人民坚决要求葡萄牙殖民者立即停止对安哥拉和葡属几内亚人民的屠杀和迫害，立即释放被监禁的爱国者，一切帝国主义势力，必须立即从安哥拉和葡属几内亚滚出去。中国人民完全支持西南非人民的爱国正义斗争，坚决支持西南非人民要求撤销南非联邦的托管权的斗争。我们祝西南非人民早日获得独立自由。
    刘长胜说，非洲民族独立运动正蓬勃发展，势不可挡，它大大地加速了帝国主义殖民体系的全面崩溃。但是，帝国主义决不会甘心放弃它们的殖民统治，特别是美帝国主义，在所谓“援助”、“友谊”等等幌子下，正从各方面大举渗入非洲，以便最后代替老殖民主义地位，把美国新殖民主义枷锁套在非洲人民的身上。
    刘长胜指出美帝国主义不仅是亚洲、拉丁美洲人民最凶恶的敌人，而且也是非洲人民最凶恶的敌人。中国人民完全相信，在英雄的非洲人民的面前，是没有任何困难不可以克服的、没有任何敌人不可以战胜的。非洲人民必然会团结得像钢铁一般坚强，使帝国主义、殖民主义碰得头破血流。
    刘长胜说，我们中国人民过去曾遭受帝国主义的长期侵略和压迫，我们与非洲人民有着共同的遭遇和命运。让我们更紧密地团结起来，互相支持，并肩前进，为彻底击败帝国主义、殖民主义的侵略和压迫而共同奋斗。中国人民和非洲人民的伟大团结和共同斗争，将加速帝国主义在亚洲、非洲和全世界的失败和灭亡。
    桑给巴尔民族主义党代表团团长米拉茨·谢拉布·阿卜杜勒和团员布尔萨拉讲了话，热烈赞扬中国人民在建设中取得的成就，指出中国人民建设新生活的努力和取得的巨大成就，使全世界人民得到不可磨灭的印象。他们说，从东方吹来的风，已经使亚洲和非洲人民从沉睡中觉醒过来，要摆脱长期束缚和奴役他们的锁链。他们说，正如毛主席所说，帝国主义是纸老虎，只要团结起来坚决同帝国主义作斗争，它们就会像纸牌一样垮下来。
    他们在讲话中表达了桑给巴尔人民争取独立自由的意志。他们说，我们桑给巴尔人民认为，我们宁愿受穷而自由，也不愿仰承帝国主义的鼻息而享受所谓繁荣。他们说，桑给巴尔人民一定要恢复他们在七十年前失去的自由。他们说，桑给巴尔民族主义党强烈地为反对帝国主义，为使本国今年就从奴役与统治下解放出来而斗争。
    他们指出，帝国主义今天是世界和平的威胁，非洲大陆亿万人民今天正从事着反对帝国主义的斗争。他们说，当英国帝国主义快要滚出去的时候，美帝国主义却试图从后门溜进来。美帝国主义在桑给巴尔和全世界的军事基地是对世界和平的威胁，显露了美国对东非和中非的领土野心。我们要对帝国主义说：你们不要干涉非洲；我们要对反动派和帝国主义的走狗说：你们的寿命不长了。他们最后高呼：“亚洲和非洲的团结和友谊万岁！”“打倒帝国主义！”“自由！”
    塞拉勒窝内代表团团长依伯拉欣·卡尔格波在讲话中，举出大量事实说明塞拉勒窝内人民对于帝国主义通过它的走狗对他们的压迫从来没有驯服过。他说，非洲非常渴望交真正的朋友，这个朋友不是那些披着羊皮的狼，不是那些“填补真空”的帝国主义者。他说，现在谁都知道帝国主义对非洲的压迫和剥削是怎么回事，塞拉勒窝内决心粉碎帝国主义的压迫，并且不要在他们的国家及整个非洲有帝国主义的任何军事基地。
    他指出，“非洲对中国的友谊的信任，是由于中国热心于拯救世界上一切被压迫的人民，而不带有谋求中国私利的动机。”他说，中国大跃进的发展，值得非洲学习。
    葡属安哥拉人民解放运动代表团负责人在讲话中说，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的不断高涨的光辉的反帝运动，极大的推动了安哥拉人民的斗争。亚非人民之间和全世界爱好和平和自由的人民之间的日益增进的团结揭穿了帝国主义这只纸老虎的软弱性，而且使我们的人民确信：只要我们把反帝斗争进行到底，殖民主义和帝国主义将要在我们这个时代里被消灭干净。安哥拉人民正在为了从葡萄牙殖民主义下解放出来和为了赢得彻底的独立，而进行着激烈的战斗。他说，伟大的中国革命、大跃进、新中国发展的空前的速度，这一切都是对全世界人民的和平自由事业的不可估量的贡献。
    中国人民对帝国主义的阴谋一直保持着警惕，并且坚决地对遭受帝国主义迫害的人民表示声援。正像你们一样，我们同样也在做着微小的光荣的努力：阻止帝国主义阻碍中国人民在争取更大的成就的道路上飞跃前进。
    葡属几内亚非洲独立党代表团负责人在讲话中说，中国人民对帝国主义和反动势力所取得的胜利和保持的警惕，以及他们正在进行的建设工作，是取之不竭的鼓舞力量和榜样的源泉，也是加强我们共同斗争的日益巩固的保证。
    他说，我们所处的历史时期的基本任务，就是全部消灭殖民主义和帝国主义。当地球上，还有一个国家的人民遭受殖民主义统治和帝国主义剥削的时候，那么就不会有世界和平的真正可能性。我们的斗争不容松懈，它应该一天天地更加团结，更加具有战斗性。不进行斗争，殖民主义和帝国主义不会让步的。
    他揭露了殖民主义者在他们国家的罪行和阴谋活动。他说，在敌人面前，我们是警惕的。敌人的本性是不会改变的，除非被全部消灭。我们确信：在今天，殖民战争导致殖民者的死亡。他说，我们的人民和我们的党坚决要战斗，直到取得对葡萄牙殖民主义的全部的、无条件的胜利。他强调说，帝国主义的本性是不会改变的。帝国主义的本性要由我们来改变的话，那就是全部把它消灭。这就是历史遗留给我们各国人民、我们这一代人的任务。
    西南非洲民族联盟主席科章吉济在讲话中说，帝国主义者在“同情者”的掩盖下，正准备损害和出卖我国人民的自由。我们将在西南非洲各个乡村和地区进行斗争。为此我们需要全世界所有朋友们和兄弟们的支持。
    他说，我们共同斗争的敌人只有一个，它进行政治统治、经济掠夺、种族歧视、经济侵略或其他侵略阴谋，这个敌人就是帝国主义，它的唯一特点是国际性的。
    他说，现在，在国际侵略集团中只有一个首领，我们在政治或经济上的事业的最大敌人就是美元。美元在欧洲大陆上保持了许多军事基地，这些基地使非洲处于奴役中。美元应对拉丁美洲遭受的经济侵略负责。美元使亚洲陷于分裂，并在中华人民共和国的周围建立军事基地和间谍网。因此我们的力量必须团结起来，团结各个大陆的力量进行斗争。我们不仅要同帝国主义斗争，而且要消灭它的傀儡和走狗。我们不仅要阻止华盛顿的触角，而且要把它摧毁。
    他控诉了殖民主义者在西南非洲的血腥罪行，指出受美国操纵的联合国虽然口头上叫嚷着正义和自由，却未能对西南非洲人民的斗争提供细微帮助。
    他最后说，我们的斗争属于非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲的斗争。我们的斗争与反对美元的斗争结合在一起。我向你们保证我个人、我国人民和我们民族联盟全力支持你们。
    这些讲话都受到了全场热烈的欢迎。讲话以后参加大会的人一致通过了大会决议。
    今天的大会是由中国亚非团结委员会、中国非洲人民友好协会、中国人民外交学会联合举行的。各人民团体负责人和各方面人士出席了大会。他们当中有：康永和、刘清扬、梅兰芳、舒舍予、浦洁修、张杰、朱子奇、王明远、吴青、吴晓达、关世雄、王瑛璞等。
    新华社20日讯　中国亚非团结委员会、中国非洲人民友好协会、中国人民外交学会，今天下午在人民大会堂举行酒会，欢迎正在我国访问的非洲外宾。他们是：以米拉茨·谢拉布·阿卜杜勒为首的桑给巴尔民族主义党代表团，以依伯拉欣·卡尔格波为首的塞拉勒窝内代表团，葡属安哥拉人民解放运动代表团，葡属几内亚非洲独立党代表团和西南非洲民族联盟科章吉济主席。
    中国亚非团结委员会副主席刘宁一在酒会上致词。他说，中国人民过去、现在和将来都永远和非洲人民站在一起，永远支持非洲人民的斗争。
    刘宁一说，中国人民和非洲人民有着共同的命运和共同的敌人，今后我们将更加团结一致，紧密合作，互相支持，为反对帝国主义、殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立，保卫世界和平而共同奋斗。
    刘宁一说，今天世界人民反对帝国主义的力量空前壮大，帝国主义的殖民体系正迅速走向崩溃，这一大好形势有利于被压迫人民争取民族解放的斗争。我们深信，只要非洲人民更加紧密地团结起来，坚持斗争，最后的胜利一定属于英雄的非洲人民。
    刘宁一感谢非洲朋友们带来了对中国人民的友谊。并且希望他们把中国人民的友谊带给全体非洲人民。刘宁一说，通过非洲朋友们的访问，中国人民和非洲人民的伟大友谊将会进一步巩固和发展。
