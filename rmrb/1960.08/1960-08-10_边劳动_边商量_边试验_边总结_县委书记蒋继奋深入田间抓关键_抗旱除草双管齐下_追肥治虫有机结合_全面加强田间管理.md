This newspaper reports: Comrade Jiang Jifen, First Secretary of the CPC Jurong County Committee in Jiangsu Province, led a working group of eleven people to the Zhepeitou Production Team of the Central Brigade of Xingxiang Commune. This is a remote mountain village rarely visited by cadres. When the commune members saw this group of people arriving, some guessed they were migrant workers passing through, others said they looked like a production inspection team, and still others said that they were so friendly, they resembled the land reform work teams of the past; no one guessed that they had come to study field management issues centered on weeding in hilly and mountainous areas.

Early the next morning, Comrade Jiang Jifen and others went to the fields with the commune members. Along the way, he saw that barren land had been planted with dryland crops and the crops were growing well, but there were a lot of weeds in some fields. "Why are there so many weeds this year? Haven't you been weeding for a long time?" Comrade Jiang Jifen asked, chatting with the commune members as he weeded. An older commune member said, "It's no use just weeding, the more you weed, the more weeds grow." Comrade Jiang Jifen didn't quite understand this at first. After thinking for a moment, he looked at the water loss in the field and suddenly realized, "There's something to this, if the field loses water, it's hard to weed, and weeds grow quickly in semi-dry and semi-wet soil." When Comrade Jiang Jifen said this, the commune member said admiringly, "Comrade, you are really something, you see through the problem at a glance."

In the afternoon, Comrade Jiang Jifen went to nearby production teams to check the fields one by one, and found that other teams also had this situation. During the field inspection, he also saw several people catching fish and shrimp, and catching yellow eels. A group of fourteen or fifteen-year-old children were only tending one cow each. They seemed to be taking turns watching the cows, with one person watching several cows, and the rest of the children climbing trees or playing around. From these phenomena, Comrade Jiang Jifen discovered a problem with labor allocation. He thought: There are so few people weeding, why can't fishing be suspended for a few days, and can't some of the half-laborers herding cattle be freed up?

In the evening, everyone held a meeting with the team cadres and poor peasant commune members. An old commune member named Lu Defa said, "This year, weeding costs a lot of work, and the fields are still messy. The labor allocation is not right. Just weeding without fighting drought makes the weeds grow fast and difficult to weed. An acre of land requires a dozen more workdays." "Then, what do you think is a reasonable arrangement for weeding and drought fighting labor?" Jiang Jifen raised this question. Based on past experience, everyone quickly calculated that the labor for weeding and drought fighting should be in a ratio of two to one. Then, everyone calculated that the labor for weeding only accounted for 33% of the total labor, and some people had to be squeezed out of fishing, cattle herding children, and students on vacation to make up for the labor needed for weeding. Finally, everyone put forward two ways to improve: one is to fight drought and weed simultaneously, so that weeds are easier to remove with good water management, and water is consumed more slowly after weeding. The other is to free up everyone who can be freed up and concentrate superior forces to weed.

The forum ended in less than two hours. It was decided after discussion with the production team leader that the next day, the entire brigade would be divided into two groups, with 50% of the labor weeding and 25% of the labor fighting drought. In addition, 144 people were drawn from fisheries and forestry, 80 half-laborers were squeezed out of 180 cattle herding children, and 20 family members of cadres and 180 students were organized to engage in shock weeding. As a result, the daily weeding progress increased sharply from more than 200 mu to more than 700 mu.

Comrade Jiang Jifen found in the process of working with the commune members that the commune members piled up together as soon as they went to the fields, worked in a rush, and had unclear responsibilities and low work efficiency. In order to solve this problem, he visited more than a dozen commune members and then held a forum with six or seven poor peasant commune members in the evening. The commune members said that other teams have labor groups, but we don't have them here. At the same time, it was also reflected that there was no labor quota for weeding; people with high skills and people with poor skills were not matched together; work was not distributed according to living conditions, and running back and forth wasted time. Based on these opinions, he and the team cadres discussed together and adopted the methods of "two fixings," "three combinations," and "one reward" to solve this problem. That is, assigning people to fields, setting quotas for people, grouping three people together, combining high and low skills, combining living conditions with distance from the field, combining personnel relations, and implementing rewards for exceeding quotas. After implementing this method, the average weeding work efficiency of the whole team increased from 0.5 mu to 1.3 mu per person per day.

On the fourth day, when Comrade Jiang Jifen inspected the weeding effect field by field, a strange thing happened. That is, the weeds in some fields were weeded very cleanly, but the rice plants were still not growing. What is the reason for this? Comrade Jiang Jifen estimated that there might be pests, but some cadres thought that the rice plants were injured during weeding. In order to solve this mystery, he ran to the field and checked it back and forth, peeling open a clump of rice seedlings to look for a while, and then peeling open another clump of rice seedlings. Later, he pulled up a rice seedling and walked to the bank of the field, and said to everyone: "This kind of stem borer is hidden in the rice leaves, and it cannot be found without careful inspection." When the commune and team cadres present saw it, there was indeed a pest in the rice field. They were surprised and said: The work has just been arranged, and another pest has come, what should we do? Comrade Jiang Jifen calmly squatted at the head of the field with everyone and studied for a while, and then suggested: "I think the solution to this problem is still to focus on weeding, weeding while controlling insects, weeding while composting grass and applying it to the fields as fertilizer, to achieve a three-combination of forward-looking and backward-looking. What do you think?" After saying that, they found a piece of land to test it, and felt that it was feasible. Immediately this method was promoted.

Comrade Jiang Jifen and the working group went deep into the team for three full days, and explored a whole set of methods for field management centered on weeding in hilly and mountainous areas, that is, grasping the internal connection of several major tasks in current field management, dividing the troops into two groups, fighting drought and weeding simultaneously; concentrating the main labor force to invest in the weeding battle; strictly organizing labor, promoting quotas, to improve weeding efficiency; and implementing the three combinations of weeding, pest control, and topdressing fertilizer. After this whole set of methods was implemented in the whole brigade, from July 27th, after five days of shock, more than 4,400 mu of rice and more than 2,400 mu of dry land had been completely cleared of weeds. The commune members happily said: The secretary is here, the difficulties are gone, and production is good. Later, facts proved that this set of methods is applicable to the entire hilly and mountainous area, and it was promoted throughout the county. Now, Comrade Jiang Jifen is still living in this team, and continues to conduct in-depth investigations and studies on the major key issues in the current work, so as to guide the work of the entire county.

    边劳动　边商量　边试验　边总结
    县委书记蒋继奋深入田间抓关键
    抗旱除草双管齐下　追肥治虫有机结合　全面加强田间管理
    本报讯　中共江苏句容县委第一书记蒋继奋同志，带领一个由十一人组成的工作组，来到了行香公社中心大队柘培头生产队。这是一个偏辟的山村，干部很少来。社员看到村上来了这一帮人，有的猜是过路民工，有的说像生产检查团，还有些人说，他们见人这样亲热，很像过去的土改工作队，就是没有猜到他们是来研究丘陵山区以除草为中心的田间管理问题的。
    第二天一早，蒋继奋同志等就和社员一起分头下田了，一路上他看到过去的荒地都种了旱谷，庄稼长的还好，只是有些田里杂草很多。“为什么今年杂草这么多呢？你们不是已锄了很长时间了吗？”蒋继奋同志一边锄草一边和社员攀谈起来。年老的社员说：“光靠除草不行，草会越锄越多。”蒋继奋同志对这句话，一时还会不过意来，他考虑了片刻，又看看田里脱水，才恍然大悟说：“这话有道理，田脱了水，除草难，土地半干半湿草长得快。”蒋继奋同志这么一说，社员就敬佩地说：“同志，你真不简单，一眼就把问题看透了。”
    下午，蒋继奋同志又到附近的生产队逐丘查看了一下，发现别队也有这种情况。就在查田的过程中，他又看到有好几个人捕鱼虾、捉黄鳝，有一群十四五岁的小孩，一人只放一头牛。他们好像轮流看牛似的，一个人看着几条牛，其余的孩子有的爬树，有的在打闹。从这些现象中，蒋继奋同志又发现了一个劳力安排问题。他想：除草的劳力这样少，捕鱼为什么不可以暂停几天，放牛的半劳力不是也可以挤出一些吗？
    晚上，大家和队干部一道开了一个贫农社员座谈会。一位四十多岁的社员陆德法说：“今年除草花的工多，田还是很毛，是劳力安排的不对头，光锄草不抗旱，草长的快又难锄，一亩田要多花十几个工。“那么，你们看锄草和抗旱的劳力究竟怎样安排才合理呢？”蒋继奋提出了这个问题。大家根据以往经验，“三下五除二”一算，除草和抗旱的劳力要二比一才合适。接着，大家又算了一下，除草的劳力只占整个劳力33％，要从捕鱼的、放牛的孩子、放假的学生等方面挤出一些人来才能补足锄草的劳力需要。最后，大家提出了两个改进的办法：一个是除草抗旱双管齐下，管好了水草好除，除了草水耗的慢。另一个是把一切能抽出来的人抽出来，集中优势兵力除草。
    座谈会不到两小时就结束了。和生产队长研究决定：第二天全大队确定兵分两路，以50％的劳力除草，25％的劳力抗旱。此外，又从渔业、林业抽出一百四十四人，从一百八十个放牛的孩子中间挤出八十个半劳力，同时又组织二十名干部家属和一百八十名学生，投入突击除草。结果这一天除草的日进度由原来的二百多亩猛增到七百多亩。
    蒋继奋同志在同社员一起劳动中又发现社员一下田就堆在一块，干活一窝蜂，责任不明，工效不高。为了解决这个问题，他访问了十几个社员以后，晚上又找六、七个贫农社员开一个座谈会。社员们说，别队都有劳动小组，我们这里没有。同时又反映了除草没有劳动定额；没有把技术高的和技术差的搭配起来，没有根据居住的条件分配工作，来回跑路浪费时间等问题。根据这些意见，他和队干部共同商量了以后，采取了“二定”、“三结合”、“一奖励”的办法来解决这个问题。就是以田定人，以人定额，三人一组，技术高低结合、居住条件靠田远近结合，人事关系结合，实行超额奖励。推行了这个办法以后，全队除草工效平均由每人每天除草五分提高一亩三分。
    蒋继奋同志在第四天逐丘检查除草的效果时，一件奇怪的事情发生了。这就是有些田里的杂草锄得很干净，但是稻棵还不见生长。这是什么原因呢？蒋继奋同志估计可能是虫害发生了，可是有些干部却认为是锄草时稻棵受了伤。为了解开这个谜，他跑到田里翻来复去地查看，扒开一丛稻苗看了一会，又扒开一丛稻苗看，后来他拔了一棵稻苗走上田岸，对大家说：“这种螟虫藏在稻叶内，不细看是不能发现的。”在场的社、队干部一看，稻田里确实发生了虫害，顿时吃惊地说：活刚安排好，又来了一个虫害，怎么办？蒋继奋冷静地同大家蹲在田头研究了一会，就提出建议说：“我看解决这个问题还是从除草上做文章，一面除草一面治虫，一面除草一面沤草下田当肥料，来它一个瞻前顾后三结合。你们看怎么样？”说罢，他们找了一块田试验了一下，觉得可行。马上又推广了这个办法。
    蒋继奋同志和工作组深入小队三个整天，就摸索出丘陵山区以除草为中心的田间管理的一整套办法，即抓着当前田间管理上几项主要工作的内在联系，兵分两路，抗旱除草双管齐下；集中主要劳力投入除草战斗；严密劳动组合，推行定额，以提高锄草工效；实行除草、治虫、追肥三结合。这一整套办法在全大队实施后，从7月27日，经过五天突击，四千四百多亩水稻和两千四百多亩旱地已全部除净了杂草。社员们高兴地说：书记来了，困难跑了，生产好了。后来事实证明这一套办法适用于整个丘陵山区，又在全县推广。现在，蒋继奋同志还住在这个队，继续深入调查研究当前工作上的重大关键问题，以指导全县的工作。（附图片）
