The representatives are spreading the story of Shen Yun'gai, known as the "Mei Lanfang of Chu Opera," who attended the Literary and Art Congress together with his student's student - the third generation of young actress, Ma Qingping.

Twenty-one-year-old Ma Qingping excels in performing as a martial female character (wudan). She has only been in the Wuhan Chu Opera Troupe for a year and has already been recognized as an advanced young actress in the province and the city. This girl, who three or four years ago lacked confidence in whether she could be a good actress, has made such rapid progress thanks to the painstaking efforts of her grandmaster, Shen Yun'gai, and her master, Luo Yuhua.

When Ma Qingping first entered the opera school, Shen Yun'gai and Luo Yuhua encouraged her ideologically and helped her with "toning her voice," breathing techniques, and practicing basic skills based on her specific conditions. Ma Qingping also worked hard to practice diligently.

As a Communist Party member, Shen Yun'gai, under the leadership of the Party branch, consistently focuses on both political and professional development of young actors. He pays special attention to cultivating their love for labor. Now, most of the more than one hundred young actors in this troupe have become Communist Party members or members of the Communist Youth League. Ma Qingping also joined the Chinese Communist Party this year. In terms of art, they can not only "shoulder the heavy responsibility" in full-length and excerpted operas, but also boldly innovate. They participated in the reform of "The Tale of the White Snake," absorbing Hubei folk music and Chu Opera percussion to replace the old melodies, and giving some of the original Peking Opera martial female character movements a unique Chu Opera style. In the "Flooding Jinshan Temple" scene, in order to express the difficulties experienced by the White Snake and Green Snake in their fight against Fahai, the young actors boldly absorbed some movements from ballet and Chu Opera stilt-walking. When walking in a circle, it seems as if the person is floating on the water, rising and falling with the waves, fighting against the wind and rain, creating a vivid and beautiful image.

    师傅和学生
    代表们传颂着号称“楚剧梅兰芳”的沈云陔偕同他学生的学生——第三代青年演员马庆萍一起参加文代会的佳话。
    二十一岁的马庆萍擅演武旦。她进武汉市楚剧团仅一年，就已经被评为全省和全市的先进青年演员了。这位在三四年前对自己能否当好演员还缺乏信心的姑娘，能有如此飞速的进步，是离不开太师傅沈云陔、师傅罗玉华的一番苦心的。
    马庆萍刚进戏校，沈云陔和罗玉华一面从思想上鼓励马庆萍，一面根据具体条件帮助马庆萍“吊嗓”、运气、练功。马庆萍也顽强地苦练。
    共产党员沈云陔在党支部领导下，对青年演员一贯是一手抓政治，一手抓业务。他特别注意培养他们热爱劳动。现在这个剧团一百多名青年演员中，多数人已经成为共产党员、共青团员。马庆萍今年也加入了中国共产党。在艺术上，他们不仅能在大本戏、折子戏中“挑大梁”，还大胆革新。他们参加改革的“白蛇传”，吸取湖北民间音乐和楚剧锣鼓代替旧曲牌，并使原来一些京剧武旦动作具有了楚剧的特殊风格。在“水漫金山”一段，为了表达白娘子、青儿同法海斗争时经历的重重困难，青年演员大胆吸取了芭蕾舞以及楚剧踩蹻中的某些动作。走起圆场来，仿佛人在水上随波起伏，与风雨搏斗，形象逼真而优美。
