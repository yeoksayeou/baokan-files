    Trial Produce One, Consolidate One
    The Beijing Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory's Measuring Tool Workshop Achieves Fast Production Startup and Rapid Quality Improvement
    (Our Newspaper's Dispatch) The Measuring Tool Workshop of the Beijing Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory has increased its new products, achieving "three fasts": fast trial production, fast production startup, and fast quality improvement. In the first half of this year, the workshop trial-produced fifteen kinds of measuring tools, and nine have already been put into production. The main performance of the main products such as calipers and torsion spring comparators has reached national standards.
    In the work of trial-producing new products, this workshop implemented the principle of "trial-producing one, consolidating one." On the one hand, it made arrangements for production and trial production in terms of labor organization, and on the other hand, it mobilized the masses to attack production bottlenecks, prompting the rapid launch of new products. At the beginning of this year, as soon as the caliper trial production was successful, the Party branch immediately proposed putting the caliper into production and striving to quickly reach a monthly output of two thousand pieces. The entire workshop launched a technical innovation movement centered on self-made special equipment, attacking the key to the large-scale increase in the production of new products. Originally, manual grinding of the caliper measuring surface was inefficient; worker Wang Chengyu and others learned from the experience of fraternal factories and used waste materials to make a six-head grinder, which could grind six at a time. Because the workshop achieved the goal of consolidating each innovation during technical innovation, most of the more than 130 major innovation projects realized in the first half of this year could be used frequently, which greatly improved production efficiency. The output of the new product caliper doubled in April compared to March, doubled in May compared to April, and increased by 30% in June compared to May, breaking through the planned output proposed by the Party branch.
    In the process of trial production and production of new products, the Party branch of the workshop resolutely implemented the principle of giving equal importance to high quality and high yield. At the beginning of the trial production of measuring tools, it put forward the strict requirement that "trial production is not considered successful if the main quality indicators do not meet national standards," and put forward the slogan "Strive to produce first-class quality measuring tools." The workshop also adopted methods such as holding quality critical discussion meetings and holding defective product exhibitions to conduct regular quality education for employees. These practices prompted everyone to pay attention to quality, enabling the quality of new products to quickly meet standards and the number of defective products to rapidly decrease. The defective rate of calipers in April was 6% to 7%, which was reduced to 1% in May, and further reduced to 0.9% in June.

### 试制一个巩固一个  北京量具刃具厂量具车间制新产品作到了投入生产快，质量提高快

    试制一个巩固一个
    北京量具刃具厂量具车间制新产品作到了投入生产快，质量提高快
    本报讯　北京量具刃具厂量具车间增加新产品，做到了“三快”：试制快，投入生产快，提高质量快。今年上半年，这个车间试制了十五种量具，已有九种投入生产，其中卡尺和扭簧比较仪等主要产品的主要性能，已经达到国家标准。
    这个车间在试制新产品工作中实行了“试制一个巩固一个”的方针，一面在劳动组织方面做了生产、试制的两线安排，一面发动群众猛攻生产关键，促使新产品迅速上马。今年年初，刚把卡尺试制成功，党支部立刻提出让卡尺投入生产、争取迅速达到月产两千件。全车间开展了以自造专用设备为中心的技术革新运动，猛攻新产品大量增产的关键。原来用手工研磨卡尺量面，效率很低；工人王成玉等学习兄弟厂的经验，用废料做了一台六头研磨机，一次可以研六个。由于车间在技术革新中作到了革新一项巩固一项，今年上半年实现的一百三十多项较大的革新项目大部分都能经常使用，有力地提高了生产效率。新产品卡尺的产量，4月比3月翻一番，5月比4月翻一番，6月又比5月增长了30％，突破了党支部提出的计划产量。
    在试制和生产新产品的过程中，车间党支部坚决贯彻执行了优质高产并举的原则。开始试制量具，就提出了“主要质量指标达不到国家标准不算试制成功”的严格要求，并且提出了“为生产第一流质量的量具而斗争”的口号。这个车间还采取开质量关键鸣放辩论会、举办废品展览会方式，对职工经常进行重视质量的教育。这些作法促使人人注意质量，使新产品质量迅速达到标准，废品迅速下降。4月份卡尺废品率为6％至7％，5月份降低到1％，6月份又降低为0.9％。
