    Make Persistent Efforts to Raise More Autumn Silkworms
    Guang'an County Vigorously Grasps Preparation for Autumn Silkworm Rearing
    (Our dispatch) After the people of Guang'an County, Sichuan Province, achieved a bumper harvest of spring cocoons, they seized the opportunity, made persistent efforts, and actively carried out preparations for autumn silkworm rearing, striving for an even greater bumper harvest of autumn cocoons.
    This year, Guang'an's spring cocoons increased by 1.34 times compared to the total output of last year. However, the people of the county were not complacent because of this. Under the leadership of the Party committee, they worked even more diligently to prepare for autumn silkworm rearing. The county, through telephone conferences and study discussions among silkworm technical cadres and heads of key silkworm farms, decided to distribute 30,000 sheets of autumn silkworm eggs, an increase of more than 17,000 sheets compared to spring silkworms. At the same time, they strived to increase yield per unit area, aiming for "autumn cocoons to surpass spring cocoons."
    In order to achieve this plan, in addition to promptly assigning tasks, the county also organized various localities, centering on silkworm specialized farms and teams, to summarize the bumper spring cocoon harvest and apply the good experiences to autumn silkworm production. At the same time, they vigorously grasped material preparation, carried out summer fertilization and management of mulberry trees, disinfected and replenished silkworm rearing equipment for silkworm houses, vigorously developed cooling and heat prevention equipment, and stockpiled supplementary feeding supplies, etc. As of now, 30 million mulberry trees have been top-dressed, accounting for about 80% of those that should be top-dressed. The "seven-character tactic" of "sweeping, shoveling, washing, scrubbing, sunning, steaming, and disinfecting" has been adopted to disinfect 80% of the silkworm houses; more than 650,000 silkworm rearing mats have been washed, accounting for 83% of the silkworm rearing mats to be used.
    The production units have also universally prepared cooling and heat prevention equipment for silkworm houses, such as "covering the roof with rice straw, building a cool shed under the eaves, installing fans indoors, placing cold water tanks in the four corners, and hanging rope curtains and wet cloths on doors and windows."
    In order to widely use anti-drying paper and wet curtain covering for rearing, reduce high temperatures, and promote silkworm growth and development, the county also opened an anti-drying paper mill.
    The communes have also made necessary reserves of supplementary feeding supplies, and have now stored 15,300 jin of sugar and more than 15,000 vials of penicillin.

    再接再厉多养秋蚕
    广安县狠抓秋蚕饲养准备工作
    本报讯　四川广安县人民在春茧丰牧后，抓紧时机，再接再厉，积极进行秋蚕饲养准备，争取秋茧的更大丰收。
    今年，广安春茧比去年全年增产一点三四倍。但是，全县人民并不因此自满，在党委的领导下，更加兢兢业业地进行秋蚕饲养准备工作，全县通过电话会，蚕桑技术干部、重点蚕桑场长专业会议的研究讨论，决定秋蚕发种三万张，比春蚕增加一万七千多张，同时努力提高单位面积产量，力争“秋茧超春茧”。
    为了实现这个计划，这个县除把任务及时布置下去外，还组织各地以蚕桑专业场、队为中心，对春茧丰收进行了总结，把好的经验用于秋蚕生产。同时大抓物资准备，对桑树进行夏季肥培管理，对蚕房蚕具进行消毒、添置蚕具，大搞降温防暑设备，储备添食用品，等等。到目前为止，有三千万株桑树己经施过追肥，占应施追肥的80％左右，采取“扫、铲、洗、刷、晒、蒸、消”七字战法，对80％的蚕房进行了消毒；洗涤蚕箔六十五万多个，占应用蚕箔的83％。
    各生产单位对蚕房还普遍作好了“屋顶盖稻草，檐下搭凉棚，屋内装风扇，四角放冷水缸，门窗挂绳帘、悬湿布”等降温防暑设备。
    为了广泛运用防干纸和湿帘复盖饲养，降低高温，促进蚕儿生长发育，这个县还开办了一个防干纸造纸厂。
    各公社对添食用品也作了必要的储备，现已贮糖一万五千三百斤，青霉素一万五千多支。
