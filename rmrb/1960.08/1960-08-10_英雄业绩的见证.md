Witness to Heroic Achievements
		Zhang Shan

    The color documentary "Conquering the World's Highest Peak," which records the achievements of our heroic mountaineers, has been completed by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio. The film contains many extremely valuable shots. Among them, the two most precious shots were taken by Comrade Qu Yinhua, a sports master and hero who reached the world's highest peak, when he personally returned down the mountain on the morning of May 25th at an altitude of 8,700 meters. One shot shows the summit of Mount Everest covered with white snow, on which a faint line of footprints left by the heroes can be seen (see left picture). The other shot is of a vast sea of clouds, with the peaks of the Himalayas emerging from the clouds like bamboo shoots just emerging from the ground (see right picture). Originally, the northern part of Mount Everest is often hit by winds of magnitude ten or higher. Snow particles on the summit are blown up by the strong wind, swept into the high sky, and turn into cloud-like "snow banners" hanging over Mount Everest. If we use a telephoto lens to photograph the summit from below the northern part of Mount Everest on a clear day, we can only see the bare ochre rocks and no snow cover; if it has just snowed and the dark clouds have not yet dissipated, the summit cannot be seen from the foot of the mountain at all. What has now been captured on film is truly a rare sight. On the morning of May 25th, when our three heroes came down from the summit, they happened to encounter a change in the weather, and it began to snow. The snow on the summit had not yet been blown away by the wind. Not far from the summit, our heroes filmed it. "How can you get tiger cubs without entering the tiger's lair?" How could these two precious shots have been taken if they had not reached the world's highest peak and created a heroic miracle? It is a testament to the heroic achievements of the heroic Chinese people in conquering the world's highest peak, adding unparalleled brilliance to this film.

    In addition to Comrade Qu Yinhua, Comrade Shi Jing also participated in the filming. Many other wonderful shots in the film taken at an altitude of more than 7,600 meters were taken by him. He filmed the heroic spirit of the mountaineering heroes persevering in their advance at a height of 8,100 meters, where they suffered from lack of oxygen and excessive physical exertion; he also captured the remains of tents and special mountaineering equipment left behind by mountaineers from capitalist countries who had failed there; and he also filmed the scene of establishing the last high mountain camp—the assault on the summit—at an altitude of 8,500 meters. In the past, an altitude of 8,000 meters was considered a death zone in aviation physiology, but today, the places where these shots were taken are all above 8,000 meters; this is a miracle created by our mountaineering heroes.

    The task of filming during the ascent is arduous. We can see from the shot at an altitude of 8,100 meters that it is difficult to maintain bodily balance during the ascent, and it is not easy to stand firm. Yet our heroes picked up the camera and filmed the shots. One can imagine how much perseverance and hard work this must have taken. And when climbing to an altitude of 8,500 meters, everyone is exhausted, but Comrade Shi Jing still insisted on filming. It would have been impossible to do this without a fearless spirit.

    Here, we must mention our two professional photographers, Comrades Mou Sen and Wang Ximao. Comrade Mou Sen was climbing a mountain for the first time, and this time he climbed to 6,800 meters, where he stayed for nine days. Comrade Wang Ximao can be said to be an old hand at filming mountaineering films, and this time he climbed to a height of 7,400 meters. During the march, in order to capture shots, they sometimes had to rush to the front of the mountaineering team; sometimes they had to risk their lives walking on the outside of the team; and sometimes they had to wait for the entire team to pass by, finish filming the shots, and then catch up with the team. When they arrived at the camp, others could rest, but they could not. They had to rush to film the materials.

    After watching this soul-stirring film, we cannot help but pay tribute to the heroic photographers who filmed this film! We thank them for writing a new and valuable chapter in the history of cinematography.

    英雄业绩的见证	张山
    纪录我们英雄的登山队员们《征服世界最高峰》的彩色纪录片，已经由中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄制完成了。影片中有许多非常宝贵的镜头。其中最值得珍贵的两个镜头，是由运动健将、登上了世界最高峰的英雄屈银华同志，亲手在5月25日清晨返回山下时在海拔八千七百米的地方拍下的。一个镜头是珠穆朗玛顶峰上布满了白皑皑的积雪，在白雪上隐约可见一行英雄们留下的足迹（见左图）。另一个镜头是一片茫茫的云海，喜马拉雅山区的群峰像刚刚冒出地层的竹笋一样露出云层（见右图）。本来珠穆朗玛峰的北部，经常有十几级大风的袭击，顶峰上的雪粒被大风吹刮起来，卷入高空，变成白云似的“雪旗”飘挂在珠穆朗玛的上空。我们如果在晴朗的天气从珠穆朗玛峰北部下面，用望远镜头来拍摄顶峰，只能看到赤裸裸的赭色的岩石，看不到积雪；如果刚刚下雪，阴云还没有消散，在山下又根本望不见顶峰。现在摄入镜头的，真是罕有的景色。5月25日清晨，我们的三位英雄，登上顶峰下来的时候，刚巧遇到天气转变，开始下雪，顶峰上的雪还没有被风刮跑，在距离顶峰不远的地方，我们的英雄拍下了它。“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”，不登上世界最高峰，创造了英雄奇迹，怎么能拍到这两个珍贵的镜头呢？它是英雄的中国人民征服世界最高峰的英雄业绩的见证，给这部影片增添了无比的光辉。
    参加拍摄的运动健将除了屈银华同志外，还有石竞同志。影片中在海拔七千六百米以上的高度所拍的许多其他精彩镜头，都是他拍的。他拍下了登山英雄们在八千一百米高处，缺氧和体力消耗过多的情况下坚持前进的英雄气概；他也把从前资本主义国家的登山家在那里遭到失败，留下的帐篷和登山特殊装备的残骸摄入了镜头；还拍下了在海拔八千五百米高度建立最后一号高山营地——突击顶峰的情景。过去八千米的高度在航空生理学上被认为死亡地带，而今天拍摄这些镜头的地方，都在八千米以上；这是我们的登山英雄们创造的奇迹。
    登山的拍摄任务是艰辛的。我们从八千一百米高度的镜头里可以看到：登山时人体的平衡都难以保持，站稳脚跟就不容易，而我们的英雄竟拿起摄影机拍摄了镜头。可以想像得到，这该要付出多大的毅力和辛劳？而攀到八千五百米高度的时候，不管谁也都是精疲力尽了，但石竞同志还是坚持拍摄，如果没有大无畏的精神是决不可能做到的。
    这里，不能不提到我们的两位专业摄影师牟森和王喜茂同志。牟森同志是第一次登山，这次攀到六千八百米，在那里住了九天。王喜茂同志可以说是一位拍登山影片的老手了，这次他攀到七千四百米的高度。在行军中间，为了抢拍镜头，他们有时要赶到登山队伍的前面；有时又要冒着生命的危险走在队伍的外边；有时却又要等整个队伍走过去，拍完了镜头，再赶上队伍去。到了营地，别人可以休息了，他们还不能休息。要抢着拍材料。
    看了这部动人心魄的影片后，我们禁不住要向拍摄这部影片的英雄的摄影师们致敬！感谢他们在电影摄影史上又写下了新的宝贵的篇章。
