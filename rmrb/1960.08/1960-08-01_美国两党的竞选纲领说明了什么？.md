What Do the Platforms of the U.S. Two Parties Show?

“Two bourgeois parties use their ostentatious and empty duels to deceive the people and divert their attention from their vital interests.” Lenin incisively pointed out the essence of the US presidential election nearly half a century ago. For half a century, the US Democratic and Republican parties have been playing this trick of deceiving the people every four years. This year's US presidential election farce has been officially announced by the recently held Democratic and Republican national conventions. Both parties have selected presidential and vice-presidential candidates and published their campaign platforms. Originally, the US presidential election was not worth much attention. However, we believe that it is not without significance to study and analyze the campaign platforms of the Democratic and Republican parties and the speeches of the two parties' presidential candidates, because it can once again help people recognize the truth that the nature of US imperialism has not changed and will never change.

This year's US presidential campaign is unfolding at a time when the US government's domestic and foreign policies, especially its foreign policy, are in deep crisis. Since the Republican Party came to power in 1953, the "policy of strength" pursued by the Eisenhower administration has suffered a shameful bankruptcy. Its actions of stepping up arms expansion and war preparation and creating international tension have aroused strong opposition from the people of the world, and the United States is increasingly isolated. In the past year, Eisenhower has played tricks of false peace in an attempt to confuse the people of the world, while stepping up preparations for war under the guise of "peace." However, the U-2 aircraft intrusion into the Soviet Union and the disruption of the Four Power Summit not long ago completely exposed Eisenhower's false peace tricks, and more and more people have recognized the true face of US imperialism as the most vicious enemy of world peace. The Eisenhower administration's war policy and aggressive policy have aroused strong dissatisfaction and blame in the United States, and the American people widely demand a change in this dangerous foreign policy. It is in this context that the Democratic and Republican parties have put forward their campaign platforms.

The American bourgeois newspapers have long pointed out that the Eisenhower administration's unpopularity has put the Republican Party at a disadvantage in this year's election. Therefore, in the campaign, the Republican Party cannot but try its best to cover up the Eisenhower administration's misdeeds, while at the same time trying to make voters believe that a new Republican government will bring them the "peace and prosperity" that the Eisenhower government has not achieved. For example, Republican presidential candidate Nixon has desperately boasted of Eisenhower's "outstanding achievements" and declared that he believes that "following in Eisenhower's footsteps is a huge responsibility and challenge." In fact, the Republican Party's campaign platform fully shows that the Republican Party is determined to continue to pursue the aggressive and war policies implemented by the Eisenhower administration, although this platform also makes some empty "peace" promises to voters, such as "achieving a just peace for all anxious mankind," "hoping to promote the cause of peace and civilization," and "preparing to negotiate for disarmament and cessation of nuclear testing."

The Republican Party's campaign platform first emphasizes continuing to expand the US military strength as the basis of its foreign policy. Eisenhower openly declared at the Republican National Convention that since he came to power, the US government's military spending has more than tripled, and it has spared no effort to develop various modern weapons. The Republican Party's campaign platform not only did not express any intention to change this arms race policy, but also clamored to "intensify and courageously" pursue efforts to expand armaments, and threatened that there is "no price limit" in expanding armaments, and "any necessary additional funding" must be provided for this purpose. The platform also emphasizes that the United States must strengthen its aggressive military blocs at "any cost" and continue to provide "military assistance" to its allies with "all necessary strength and funding." These steps are obviously incompatible with the platform's expression of willingness to disarm, and they can only show that the Republican Party is determined to implement a policy of preparing for a new war. This can also be seen from the Republican Party's campaign platform's public announcement of continuing to adopt hostile and provocative policies towards China, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries. It emphasizes that the United States "firmly opposes recognizing Communist China and allowing it to enter the United Nations," clamors to "smash the Soviet Union's conspiracy is our greatest task," and is "determined" to find ways to make the so-called "enslaved countries" gain "independence." Isn't this a thorough continuation of Dulles's "brinkmanship" and "liberation policy"? Regarding nationally independent countries, the Republican Party also stated in its campaign platform that it will not change its policy of interfering in their internal affairs and stepping up economic aggression and military control over them. Especially for Latin American countries that are actively striving for and safeguarding national independence, it reiterated that the United States should fulfill its "unalterable obligations" according to the so-called "Monroe Doctrine," that is, to interfere in these countries' national independence movements. Therefore, it can be said that the Republican Party's campaign platform regarding foreign policy is nothing more than a reaffirmation of the current US aggressive and war policies and expresses a clear determination to continue to implement such policies.

The Democratic Party is attempting to take advantage of the Republican government's unprecedentedly low prestige to win this year's presidential election. Therefore, in its campaign platform, it vigorously attacked the Republican government's policy failures, "suffered diplomatic embarrassments," and "failed in collecting facts, making decisions, and coordinating actions"; at the same time, it tried its best to show that it would implement a "new policy" that is different from the Republican Party. But even with a microscope, it is difficult for people to find anything substantially different from the Republican Party's policies in the Democratic Party's campaign platform. The Democratic Party's platform emphasizes that the United States must establish "a deterrent military force"; if its candidate is elected president, his primary task will be to "reorganize our military capabilities" to provide "diverse, balanced, and mobile forces and weapons" that can engage in both limited wars and full-scale wars "in quantity and quality"; and it clamors that "we must first restore our national strength." It openly declares that the Democratic Party's goal is not to "coexist" with communism, viciously slanders socialist countries as "enslaved countries" and "prisons," saying that the Democratic Party "will not abandon the people of all countries currently behind the Iron Curtain by expressing any formal agreement to the status quo"; it clamors to continue to occupy China's territory Taiwan and is "determined to oppose the admission of Communist China into the United Nations at present." The Democratic Party's platform also says: "The US government under the Democratic Party will unhesitatingly fulfill its obligations under the treaties and agreements it has entered into with countries in the Western Hemisphere," clamoring that the United States must establish a "world order." What is the difference between the policies that the Democratic Party has stated it will implement and the Republican Party's policies? The Democratic Party's campaign platform is nothing more than a restatement of the Republican Party's policies in different words. Even "The New York Times" could not help but point out in a recent editorial that "the Democratic Party's platform does not question the Eisenhower administration's main goal in foreign policy, which is to closely cooperate with our friends to defend freedom (should be read as carrying out aggression), nor does it question the main means to achieve this goal—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, common security, and aid to underdeveloped countries." The newspaper said that the two parties are only arguing about the question of "which party and which candidate are most capable of using these means to achieve this goal." "The New York Herald Tribune" also said in an editorial that the Democratic Party's foreign policy "does not have any differences in goals and principles from the Republican government."

For more than ten years after the war, whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party has been in power, their governments have openly emphasized implementing the so-called bipartisan foreign policy. As early as before Dulles became the US Secretary of State, the Democratic Party's Truman government was actually implementing Dulles's foreign policy line. The later Eisenhower government was only continuing to follow this line. In this presidential election, although the Democratic Party has made a great show of advertising that "foreign policy will be the key in this campaign" and is the "number one issue," Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy also admitted that when dealing with the Soviet Union, "there is no such thing as a Democratic way or a Republican way (of distinguishing)." And Democratic vice-presidential candidate Johnson, after holding a secret meeting with Allen Dulles, one of the important figures of the Republican Party, even felt it necessary to publicly state that the two parties are completely united in warmongering. He said: "It must be made clear that the United States has no differences in dealing with communism." Therefore, how can the Democratic Party think that it can make American voters hope that it will implement some "new policies"?

Past facts have proven that the US two parties' campaign platforms over the years have had the deceptive nature of American commercial advertisements. They always use a large pile of beautiful words to whitewash their reactionary policies and make many deceptive promises to voters, but in the end, these promises are not fulfilled at all. Whether it is the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, the policies they implement after coming to power are always more reactionary than the policies they proclaimed in their campaign platforms. Therefore, in order to estimate the policies that they will implement from a Democratic or Republican campaign platform, even one filled with "peace" rhetoric, it is also necessary to discount it greatly. However, this year's campaign platforms of the US two parties more blatantly advocate the US aggressive and war policies than their campaign platforms at any time in the past. This shows that the US ruling group is determined to more openly promote its sinister plan to dominate the world.

If the two parties' campaign platforms still have to be somewhat cautious in advocating aggression and war, then the campaign speeches of the two parties' presidents and vice presidents and other leaders are even more naked in this regard. Nixon, as the Republican presidential candidate, openly clamored to establish the United States' unified world, saying that "it is not enough" to "contain or stop the Communists," and the United States' "goal must be the victory of freedom throughout the world." Vice-presidential candidate Lodge clamored to carry out a "life-and-death struggle" with the socialist camp. The Democratic Party's pair of candidates was not far behind. Kennedy advocated being "tenacious" and "courageous" in promoting aggressive policies. Johnson advocated "resisting the challenge of communism." The war-mongering tones between them are so indistinguishable. It can be seen that the US ruling group's selection of them to be the protagonists of this presidential election farce is not accidental.

Although the next president of the United States will not be finally elected until November, no matter whether the Democratic or Republican candidate will replace Eisenhower, people can now see clearly what kind of policies the next US government will implement.

Regarding US imperialism, it is necessary to recognize its essence from the perspective of class analysis, and to recognize that both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are only tools for the US monopoly capital group to promote its reactionary domestic and foreign policies. Since the nature of US imperialism will not change, that is to say, the US monopoly capital group will not abandon its aggressive and war policies, then the US ruling group will never allow the emergence of any "enlightened" government to implement "enlightened" policies that violate their will. On the contrary, the more the US ruling group is reduced to a dead end in brutally suppressing democratic and progressive forces at home and pursuing aggressive policies abroad, the more reactionary and crazy it will only become. The current campaign platforms of the US Democratic and Republican parties and the speeches of the two parties' presidential candidates prove this law of all imperialists and reactionaries most clearly.

However, just as the aggressive and war policies implemented by the Eisenhower administration have suffered a shameful defeat, the next US government, regardless of whether its leader is Nixon or Kennedy, will naturally not have any good results in continuing to pursue such policies, but will only make US imperialism more isolated in front of the people of the world, and will also inevitably promote the American people to become increasingly awakened and more determined to oppose the reactionary rule of the US monopoly group.

### 美国两党的竞选纲领说明了什么？

    美国两党的竞选纲领说明了什么？
    “两个资产阶级政党利用它们之间的虚张声势的毫无内容的决斗来欺骗人民，转移人民对切身利益的注意。”列宁在将近半个世纪以前就曾经这样一针见血地指出美国总统选举的实质。半个世纪以来，美国的民主党和共和党一直是四年一度地玩弄这种欺骗人民的把戏。本届的美国总统选举丑剧已经由最近分别举行的民主、共和两党的全国代表大会正式宣告开锣了。两个党都已选出了总统和副总统候选人，发表了竞选纲领。本来美国总统选举这件事情并不值得人们给予多大的注意。但是我们认为对民主党和共和党的竞选纲领以及两党总统候选人的言论进行一番研究和分析，不无意义，因为它可以再一次帮助人们认清美帝国主义的本性没有改变而且永远也不会改变这一真理。
    今年美国两党的总统竞选运动，是在美国政府的国内外政策，特别是外交政策陷入深重危机的情况下展开的。自从共和党于1953年执政以来，艾森豪威尔政府所奉行的“实力政策”遭到了可耻的破产，它加紧扩军备战和制造国际紧张局势的行径激起了世界人民强烈的反对，美国日益陷于孤立。近一年来，艾森豪威尔玩弄假和平的把戏，企图迷惑世界人民，而在“和平”烟幕掩盖下加紧准备战争。但是在不久以前发生的U—2飞机侵苏事件和四国首脑会议的被破坏，把艾森豪威尔的假和平把戏全部拆穿，越来越多的人认清了美帝国主义是世界和平最凶恶敌人的真面目。艾森豪威尔政府的战争政策和侵略政策已在美国国内引起了强烈的不满和责难，美国人民广泛要求改变这种危险的外交方针。民主和共和两党正是在这样的情况下提出它们的竞选纲领的。
    美国的资产阶级报刊早就指出，艾森豪威尔政府的不得人心，使得共和党在今年大选中处于不利地位。因此共和党在竞选中不能不一方面竭力掩饰艾森豪威尔政府的劣迹，同时又要设法使选民相信一个新的共和党政府将会给他们带来艾森豪威尔政府所没有实现的“和平和繁荣”。例如共和党总统候选人尼克松就拼命吹嘘艾森豪威尔的“卓越的政绩”，并且声称：他认为“追随艾森豪威尔的步伐是一个巨大的责任和挑战”。事实上共和党的竞选纲领完全表明了，共和党决心要继续奉行艾森豪威尔政府所实行的侵略和战争政策，尽管这个纲领也对选民作了一些什么“为全体焦虑的人类实现正义的和平”、“希望促进和平和文明事业”、“准备为裁军和停止核试验进行谈判”之类的空洞的“和平”诺言。
    共和党的竞选纲领首先强调以继续扩充美国的军事力量作为外交政策的基础。艾森豪威尔在共和党代表大会上公开宣扬，自从他执政以来，美国政府的军费开支已经增加了三倍多，并且一直不遗余力地发展各种现代武器。而共和党的竞选纲领不但没有表示要改变这种军备竞赛的方针，而且叫嚷要“加紧地、勇敢地进行”扩军的努力，扬言在扩军方面“是没有价格限制的”，必须为此“提供任何必要的更多的经费”。纲领同时强调，美国要“不惜一切代价”来加强它所拼凑的侵略性军事集团，“以一切必要的力量和经费”继续对美国的盟国提供“军事援助”。这样一些步骤，同纲领中所谓愿意裁军的表示显然是毫不相容的，它们只能表明共和党要坚决执行准备新战争的方针。这从共和党竞选纲领中公开宣布对中国、苏联和其他社会主义国家继续采取敌视和挑衅性的政策中，也可以看得出来。它强调美国“坚决反对承认共产党中国和允许它进入联合国”，叫嚷“粉碎苏联的阴谋是我们最大的任务”，并且“决心”要设法使所谓“被奴役国家”获得“独立”。这不是彻头彻尾的杜勒斯的“战争边缘政策”和“解放政策”的继续吗？对于民族独立国家，共和党在它的竞选纲领中也表示不改变干涉它们的内政、加紧对它们进行经济侵略和军事控制的政策。特别是对于正在积极争取和维护民族独立的拉丁美洲国家，它重申美国要根据所谓“门罗主义”来履行其“不可改变的义务”，也就是说干涉这些国家的民族独立运动。因此，可以说共和党的竞选纲领有关外交政策的部分，不过是对美国现行侵略和战争政策的重申，并且表示了继续贯彻这种政策的明确决心而已。
    民主党是企图利用共和党政府威信空前低落的机会来取得今年总统选举的胜利的。因此它在竞选纲领中，大肆攻击共和党政府所执行的政策失败，“在外交上出丑”，“在收集事实，作出决定和协调行动方面失灵”；同时竭力想表示它将要实行一种不同于共和党的“新的政策”。但是人们却即使用显微镜也很难从民主党的竞选纲领中找到什么和共和党的政策有实质上不同的新东西。民主党的纲领强调美国必须建立“具有威慑作用的军事力量”；如果它的候选人当选总统，他的首要工作将是“改组我们的军事能力”，以提供“在数量上和质量上”既可从事有限战争又可进行全面战争的“多样的、平衡的、机动的部队和武器”；并且叫嚷“我们首先必须恢复我们的国家实力”。它公开宣布，民主党的目标不是同共产主义“共处”，恶毒地诽谤社会主义国家是“被奴役国家”和“监狱”，说什么民主党“不会通过对现状表示任何正式的同意而放弃目前处于铁幕后面的各国人民”；叫嚣要继续霸占中国领土台湾，“决心反对在目前接纳共产党中国进入联合国”。民主党的纲领还说：“民主党执政时的美国政府将不加踌躇地履行它在西半球国家所订立的条约和协定所负有的义务”，叫嚣美国要建立“世界秩序”。民主党所表示要执行的政策同共和党的政策有什么两样呢？民主党的竞选纲领不过是用一种不同的词句来申述共和党的政策罢了。连“纽约时报”在最近发表的一篇社论中也禁不住指出，“民主党的政纲既未对艾森豪威尔的外交政策的主要目的，就是同我们的朋友密切合作保卫自由（应读作进行侵略）提出疑问，也未对实现这一目的的主要手段——北大西洋公约组织、共同安全及援助不发达国家——提出疑问”。这家报纸说，两党要争论的只是这样一个问题：“哪一个党和哪一个候选人最有能力利用这些手段来达到这个目的”。“纽约先驱论坛报”的社论也说，民主党的外交政策“在目标和原则上同共和党政府并没有什么分歧”。
    战后十多年来，不论是民主党还是共和党执政，它们的政府都公开强调执行所谓两党外交政策。早在杜勒斯未当美国国务卿以前，民主党的杜鲁门政府实际上就是在执行杜勒斯的外交路线。后来的艾森豪威尔政府也不过是继续遵循这一路线而已。在这一次的总统竞选中，尽管民主党曾煞有介事地宣传说“外交政策将是这次竞选运动中的关键”，是“第一号问题”。但是民主党的总统候选人肯尼迪却也承认，在同苏联打交道的时候，“没有什么民主党的办法或共和党的办法（的区别）的”。而民主党副总统候选人约翰逊，在同共和党的重要人物之一艾伦·杜勒斯举行秘密会议以后，甚至认为有必要公开表明，两党在好战方面完全一致，他说：“必须清楚表明，美国在对付共产主义时并无分歧”。因此，民主党又怎能认为它可以使美国的选民对它将执行什么“新的政策”寄予希望呢？
    过去的事实已经证明，美国两党历年的竞选纲领都有着美国商业广告式的欺骗性，它总是用一大堆漂亮的词句来粉饰它们的反动政策，对选民作出许许多多迷惑人心的诺言，但是到头来这些诺言又都丝毫未予兑现。不论是民主党或者共和党，它们执政以后所执行的政策总是要比它们在竞选时发表的纲领中所揭橥的方针更反动得多。因此要从一个即使是充满着“和平”言词的民主党或共和党的竞选纲领来估计它们将会执行的政策，也需要大打折扣的。然而今年美国两党的竞选纲领却比它们过去任何时候的竞选纲领都更露骨地鼓吹美国的侵略和战争政策，这表明了美国统治集团决心要更明目张胆地推行它称霸世界的罪恶计划。
    如果说，两党的竞选纲领在鼓吹侵略和战争方面仍然不能不稍有顾忌的话，那末两党的总统和副总统以及其他头目的竞选言论在这方面就更加赤裸裸得多了。作为共和党总统候选人的尼克松公开叫嚷要建立美国的一统天下，说什么“箝制或制止共产党”还是“不够的”，美国的“目的必须是自由在全世界取得胜利”。副总统候选人洛奇则叫嚷要同社会主义阵营进行“你死我活的斗争”，民主党的一对候选人也不甘落后，肯尼迪鼓吹在推行侵略政策时要“顽强”、“有勇气”。约翰逊则鼓吹“抵抗共产主义的挑战”。他们之间的好战声调是如此的难分伯仲，可见美国统治集团选定他们出来担任这一次总统选举丑剧的主角并不是偶然的。
    虽然美国下一届的总统，还要到11月才最后选出。但是不论是民主党或者共和党的候选人将接替艾森豪威尔的位置，人们现在已经完全可以清楚地看得出，下一届的美国政府将会执行什么样的政策。
    对于美帝国主义，必须根据阶级分析的观点来认识它的实质，认识民主党和共和党都同样不过是美国垄断资本集团推行它的反动的国内外政策的工具。既然美帝国主义的本性是不会改变的，也就是说美国垄断资本集团是不会放弃它的侵略和战争政策的，那末美国统治集团就绝对不会容许出现什么“开明”的政府来执行违反他们意志的“开明”政策。相反的，美国统治集团在对内残暴镇压民主进步力量、对外推行侵略政策越是陷于日暮途穷的境地，就只会越加反动和疯狂。目前美国民主、共和两党的竞选纲领和两党总统候选人的言论，就再清楚不过地证明了这一个一切帝国主义和反动派的规律。
    但是，正如艾森豪威尔政府所执行的侵略和战争政策已遭到了可耻的失败一样，美国的下一届政府，不管它的首脑是尼克松也好，是肯尼迪也好，继续奉行这样的政策，自然也不会有什么好的结果，而只能使美帝国主义在全世界人民面前更加孤立，同时也必将促使美国人民日益觉醒起来，更坚决地反对美国垄断集团的反动统治。
