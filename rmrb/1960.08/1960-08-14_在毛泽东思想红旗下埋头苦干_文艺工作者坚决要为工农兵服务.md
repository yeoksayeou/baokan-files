    Work diligently under the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought
    Literary and art workers are determined to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers
    (Our newspaper dispatch) More than two thousand three hundred literary and art warriors held an unprecedented gathering in the capital. The Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, which lasted for more than twenty days, successfully closed yesterday. The Great Hall of the People was filled with joy and thunderous applause. The will of more than two thousand representatives has been transformed into a solemn and firm voice in the congress resolution: hold high the banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and strive for a greater leap forward in socialist literature and art!
    This is not only a vow made by all the representatives to the Party, but also the common aspiration of millions of professional and amateur literary and art warriors of all nationalities in our country.
    At this conference, all the representatives once again felt the Party and Chairman Mao's cordial concern and ardent expectations for the cause of literature and art. Writers, artists, and worker-peasant-soldier amateur literary and art workers from all over the country expressed their great ambitions to the Party under the huge portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, under the revolutionary red flag, and in front of the colorful stage.
    A working-class literary and art contingent is growing
    Three years ago, when our country's struggle between the two lines in literary and art circles achieved a decisive victory, the Party had already expected it; today, this scene has been placed before people's eyes. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, our country has found the most correct, broadest, and most creative path for developing socialist literature and art: letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend, and bringing forth new ideas on the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialism; a strong literary and art contingent with working-class literary and art workers as its backbone is growing. This makes it possible for us to climb to a new and greater peak of literature and art than in any previous era!
    How could this not make all the representatives feel honored and proud? These warriors who have been forging ahead and singing triumphant songs on the road guided by the Party are all vying to use the most beautiful language to express their love and gratitude to the Party and Chairman Mao. Just as the poet Tian Jian said, the Party and Chairman Mao "handed us the key to truth and opened the treasure house of wisdom and the gate of genius for us"; and just as the Mongolian folk poet Baja sang in his poem dedicated to Chairman Mao: "You are the golden sun on the earth, you are the banner and red light in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people!"
    The direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers has been further deepened in the hearts of the people
    Whom should literature and art serve? Chairman Mao raised this question eighteen years ago, and the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, as stipulated by Chairman Mao at that time, has been further deepened in the hearts of the people.
    Many representatives expressed their common feelings. Writers Du Pengcheng and Wang Wenshi said: We can freely describe the worker-peasant masses, describe their lofty ideals and victorious struggles. This is the highest happiness and the greatest glory for literary artists. Poets Li Ji and Wen Jie also had the same experience. They said: "Singing the creative labor, infinite wisdom, and continuously revolutionary fighting spirit of the worker-peasant masses is singing the essence of our lives, the reality of our society, and the characteristics of our era."
    It was with this belief that the old writer Ba Jin, when talking about his creative experience, said with emotion that in the old society he had only a young man's sense of justice and an enthusiastic pen, and although he was wholeheartedly pursuing light, he only saw darkness. But today, he has "seen the light of the new society" and has the opportunity to use his "worn pen, which used to write about pain and disaster, to describe the victory and joy of the people."
    The Peking opera actress Tong Zhiling's experience of more than twenty years in the arts, from being called the "Queen of Spinning" to playing "Zhao Yiman," vividly illustrates how the Party and Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line has helped old literary and art workers gain new life. She was deeply moved by the noble sentiments of the heroic characters in the play and felt that the heroic characters she played were "forcing" her to strengthen her ties with the worker-peasant laboring people, and slowly felt that her thoughts and feelings were gradually changing, and that she had improved both politically and artistically.
    The young pianist Liu Shikun recalled that when he used to go on stage, he always thought about the audience's reaction, his personal gains and losses—whether he would make a splash or fall into obscurity. But after he went through labor training and performed in factories and troops, he gradually felt that the performer on stage and the audience off stage were all serving a common goal, and only then could his emotions be full and overflowing, and he had a correct understanding and expression of music, and the audience felt that his piano sound was kind and pleasant.
    The Party further teaches us: "Serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the most thorough and resolute proletarian literary and artistic direction. It not only requires literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and to portray the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but more fundamentally, it requires writers and artists to be worker-peasant-ized and to thoroughly transform their world outlook."
    "Only by first being a strong and continuously revolutionary fighter can one be a veritable singer." Music worker Li Huanzhi told everyone that composers must become ordinary laborers so that they can become practical miners in the treasure house of the people's lives and be true creators of musical art.
    Become one with the worker-peasant masses, becoming a member of the collective
    Since the Great Leap Forward, no one knows how many writers and artists across the country have gone up to the mountains, down to the countryside, and down to the factories, throwing themselves into the fiery struggle. Representatives from Shandong introduced at the meeting the situation of their organization of literary and art service groups to the front line of production. They lived among the masses, not only writing themselves, but also actively helping the masses to write, and forming comrades-in-arms on the production and literary and art fronts with heroes and models.
    This moving scene, as some representatives said, "We must become one with the worker-peasant masses, not just two separate pieces, but like an alloy in metal, becoming a member of them."
    The young writer Li Zhun vividly proved with his own experience that it is equally important for the younger generation of literary and art workers to go deep into the worker-peasant masses for a long time and transform their thinking through labor.
    The old writer Liu Qing, who has lived among the peasants for eight years as one day, has settled in Huangfu Village, Chang'an County, Shaanxi. In his speech, he said earnestly: "For us, the transformation of ideological consciousness is paramount. Without studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works and without emotion with ordinary laborers, no literary genius will be able to write the works that the people need today."
    After this victorious review and the oath-taking of the leap forward, a new battle is about to begin for our country's literary and art workers. They will hold higher the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, sing loudly the triumphant song of the era of the East wind prevailing over the West wind, seek truth from facts, work diligently, and create more and better literary and artistic works.

### 在毛泽东思想红旗下埋头苦干  文艺工作者坚决要为工农兵服务

    在毛泽东思想红旗下埋头苦干
    文艺工作者坚决要为工农兵服务
    本报讯　两千三百多名文艺战士，在首都举行了一次盛况空前的会师。历时二十多天的全国第三次文代大会，昨天已经胜利闭幕了。人民大会堂里喜气盈盈，掌声雷动。两千多代表的意志，化成了大会决议中一个庄严而坚定的声音：更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的旗帜，为实现社会主义文学艺术的更大跃进而努力！
    这不仅是全体代表向党发出的誓言，也是我国各民族千百万专业、业余文艺战士共同的心声。
    在这次大会上，全体代表再一次感受了党和毛主席对文艺事业的亲切关怀和殷切期望。来自各地的作家、文艺家和工农兵业余文艺工作者，在伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像和革命的红旗下，在花红草绿的台前，向党表述了自己的雄心大志。
    一支工人阶级的文艺队伍正在成长起来
    三年以前，在我国文艺界两条道路斗争取得决定性胜利的时候，党就曾经预期过；今天，这个情景已经摆在人们的眼前。在党中央和毛泽东同志领导下，我国已经找到了一条发展社会主义文学艺术的最正确、最宽广、最富于创造性的道路：在为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的方向下百花齐放、百家争鸣、推陈出新；一支以工人阶级的文学艺术工作者为骨干的强大的文学艺术队伍正在成长起来。这就使我们有可能攀登上比过去任何时代更为伟大的新的文学艺术的高峰！
    这怎能不使所有的代表感到光荣，感到自豪？这些曾经在党所指引的道路上披荆斩棘、高歌猛进的战士，都争着用最美好的语言，来倾吐对党和毛主席的热爱和感激。正像诗人田间所说的，是党和毛主席“把真理的钥匙交给了我们，为我们打开了智慧的宝库和天才之门”；也正像蒙古族民间老诗人琶杰在献给毛主席的诗篇中歌唱的：“您是人间大地上金色的太阳，您是亿万人民心中的旗帜和红光！”
    文艺为工农兵服务的方向已经进一步深入人心
    文艺为什么人，毛主席在十八年前就提出了这个问题，毛主席那时所规定的文艺要为工农兵服务的方向，已经进一步地深入人心。
    许多代表说出了他们共同的感受。作家杜鹏程、王汶石说：我们能够自由地描写工农群众，描写他们崇高的理想和胜利的斗争，这是文学艺术家最高的幸福，最大的光荣。诗人李季和闻捷也有着同样的体验。他们说：“歌唱工农群众创造性的劳动、无穷的智慧和不断革命的斗争精神，就是歌唱了我们生活的本质，我们社会的真实，我们时代的特征。”
    正是本着这样的信念，老作家巴金在谈起他的创作经历时，才感慨地说，他过去在旧社会空有一个年青人的正义感和一支热情的笔，虽然一心追求光明，但看到的只是一片黑暗。而今天，他却“见到了新社会的光明”，而且有机会用他“那支写惯了痛苦和灾祸的秃笔，来描写人民的胜利和欢乐。”
    京剧演员童芷苓在她二十多年的艺术生活中，从被人称为“劈纺大王”到饰演“赵一曼”，这个不平常的经历，生动地说明了党和毛主席的文艺路线，是怎样帮助了旧的文艺工作者获得新生。她深深被剧中英雄人物的高尚情操所感染，觉得自己所扮演的英雄人物在“逼”着她去加强和工农劳动人民的联系，慢慢感到思想感情逐渐起了变化，政治上和艺术上都得到提高。
    青年钢琴家刘诗昆回忆他过去上台时，心里考虑的总是听众的反映，个人的得失——是一鸣惊人还是名落千丈。而当他经过劳动锻炼，并且到工厂、部队去演出以后，他才逐渐感觉到台上的演奏者和台下的听众都是在为一个共同的目标服务，这时他的感情才能够充沛而洋溢，对音乐有了正确的理解和表现，听众也都感到他的琴声亲切和动听了。
    党进一步教导我们：“为工农兵服务，是最彻底最坚决的无产阶级的文艺方向，它不但要求文艺为工农兵服务，表现工农兵，而更根本的是要求作家艺术家工农化，彻底改造自己的世界观。”
    “只有首先做一个坚强的不断革命的战士，才能做一个名副其实的歌手。”音乐工作者李焕之告诉大家，作曲家要成为一个普通劳动者，这样他才会在人民生活的矿藏中，成为一名切切实实的采矿者，也才是真正的音乐艺术的创作者。
    和工农群众打成一片，成为集体中间的一分子
    大跃进以来，全国不知有多少作家、艺术家上山下乡下厂，投入了火热的斗争。来自山东的代表，在会上介绍了他们组织文艺服务团到生产第一线的情况。他们生活在群众之中，不但自己写，还积极帮助群众写，和英雄模范结成了生产和文艺战线上的战友。
    这动人的景象，正像有的代表所说的，“我们要和工农群众打成一片，而不是两片，要像金属里的合金一样，成为他们中间的一分子。”
    青年作家李准用自己的经验生动地证明了：长期地深入到工农群众中去，在劳动中改造思想，对青年一代的文艺工作者同样重要。
    曾经八年如一日地生活在农民之中的老作家柳青，已经在陕西长安县皇甫村落了户。他在发言中讲了一段语重心长的话：“对于我们来说，思想意识的改造是首要的，不学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作，同普通劳动者没有感情，任何文学天才，都不会写出人民今天需要的作品。”
    经过这一次胜利的检阅和跃进的誓师，摆在我国文艺工作者面前的新的战斗即将开始了。他们将更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，高唱出东风压倒西风的时代凯歌，实事求是，埋头苦干，创作出更多更好的文艺作品。
