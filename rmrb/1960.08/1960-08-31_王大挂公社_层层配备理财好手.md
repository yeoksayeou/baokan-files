    Wang Dagua Commune
    Assigning Frugality Experts at Every Level
    In the Wang Dagua Commune of Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, community and team cadres are promoting a spirit of diligence and frugality in running the community.

    The commune and its production teams have assigned several loyal and reliable individuals who are good at frugality and financial management to oversee several key areas, adhering to the principle of diligence and frugality in running the community. Wang Jinsheng, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, is the top frugality expert. He often says:
  “Building a household is like picking soil with a needle, while ruining it is like sand being washed away by water.” He pays attention to economic accounting and effectiveness in everything, from using people to spending money and utilizing materials. He personally inspects everything from production to life, from agricultural capital construction to daily office supplies. Other secretaries focus on key areas such as finance, warehousing, animal husbandry, machinery, and canteens, working diligently and conscientiously to do their jobs well. Each production team is also equipped with several experts. For example, the branch secretaries or production team leaders of production teams such as Daijiakou, Wang Dagua, and Zhang Xiban are all good housekeepers who know how to calculate and manage finances. Below them are also impartial accountants, loyal storekeepers, hardworking clerks, and machinery operators who cherish machinery. These people work together wholeheartedly for the benefit of the community, without wasting a single blade of grass or tree.

    Over the past two years, the commune's public accumulation has reached more than 320,000 yuan, almost all of which has been used to expand reproduction. Management fees have been reduced to 0.5%. The commune's machinery and farm implements have saved tens of thousands of yuan in repair costs.

    Commune cadres have all learned how to manage their households and are always diligent and frugal, taking the lead in everything, working at least four months a year. Commune cadres constantly assess and compare the production and economic activities of the masses, identifying who is advanced and who is lagging behind, who is frugal and who is wasteful, using living examples to educate the masses. For example, the Commune Party Committee holds a cadre "living" meeting at least once a month, specifically to find experiences, establish role models, identify loopholes, and tap potential from the perspectives of diligence and frugality, increasing income and reducing expenditure, and how to use money, materials, and people. Recently, more than 600 people were identified from the canteen and animal husbandry sectors who could be released to participate in field production. In the past year, this commune has established more than 700 models of diligence and frugality.

    王大挂公社
    层层配备理财好手
    山东平原县王大挂公社在勤俭办社中，社队干部大兴勤俭之风。
    这个公社和各生产队都配备有几把忠诚可靠，能勤俭、善理财的好手，分别把守住几个重要方面，坚持勤俭办社。这个公社的党委第一书记王金生，就是第一把勤俭好手。他常说：
  “治家好比针挑土，败家好比水冲沙”，凡是用人用钱用物，处处讲究经济核算，经济实效。从生产到生活，从农业基本建设到日常办公用品，他都亲自检点。其他几位书记分别抓住财务、保管、饲养、机械、食堂几个重要方面，克勤克俭，兢兢业业，一心把工作做好，各生产队也都配上几把好手。如代家口、王大挂、张希班等生产队，支部书记或生产队长都是会盘算、会理财的好当家人。下面还有公正无私的会计，忠心耿耿的保管员，刻苦耐劳的事务员，爱护机械的机械手等。这些人同心协力为社效劳，一草一木也不浪费。
    两年来，公社公共积累达三十二万多元，几乎全部用于扩大再生产。管理费压缩到0.5％。公社的机械、农具节约修补费数万元。
    公社干部人人学会当家过日子，凡事克勤克俭，一马当先，一年至少劳动四个月。公社干部对群众生产活动和经济活动不断进行核算、评比，看哪个先进，哪个落后；哪个节约，哪个浪费，用活的教材教育群众。如公社党委每月至少召开一次干部“过日子”会，专门从勤与俭、开源与节流，以及如何用钱用物用人等方面找经验、树标兵，查漏洞、挖潜力。最近从食堂、饲养两个方面，又查出六百多人可以抽出参加田间生产。一年来，这个公社已经树立起勤俭标兵七多百人。
