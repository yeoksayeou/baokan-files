Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, August 21st: Full text of Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech at the banquet hosted by Afghan Prime Minister Daoud: Your Honorable Prime Minister Daoud, Your Honorable Deputy Prime Minister Ali Mohammad, Your Honorable Deputy Prime Minister Naim, Dear Friends:

Thank you to the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan and Your Honorable Deputy Prime Minister Naim for your kind invitation, which has enabled me to visit your beautiful country. Tonight, I am honored to have the opportunity to gather with you, dear friends, at this grand welcome banquet hosted by Your Honorable Prime Minister Daoud. The day after tomorrow is the great festival of the forty-second anniversary of Afghanistan's independence. From their own personal experience, the Chinese people deeply understand the value and significance of independence, and fully understand the excitement people feel when celebrating their country's independence. On this auspicious and joyful occasion, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in my own name, to express my sincere respect and warm congratulations to you, and through you to the heroic Afghan people.

For thousands of years, China and Afghanistan have lived in harmony. As Your Honorable Prime Minister Daoud has said, "Our relationship has never been damaged by differences or resentment." Our ancestors jointly opened up the famous "Silk Road," which made important contributions to promoting mutual understanding between the two peoples, facilitating trade and cultural exchanges between East and West. Both of our countries have suffered from colonial aggression. During the years of heroic struggle against colonial aggressors, the people of our two countries have always cared for and sympathized with each other. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, our two countries' historically tested friendship has been further developed on a new basis. We will not forget that Afghanistan was one of the first countries to recognize the People's Republic of China; the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan has consistently advocated the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations; and the Afghan people have always sympathized with the Chinese people's struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Chinese government and people deeply appreciate this. The Chinese government and people have always highly valued and actively supported the foreign policy of peace and neutrality pursued by the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, and your efforts to promote friendship among peoples of all countries and strive for world peace. In recent years, through mutual visits by leaders of the two countries and friendly exchanges of various cultural and scientific and technological delegations, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries have been continuously strengthened. As Your Honorable Naim said during his visit to our country last year, "The friendly relations existing betweeen our two countries are a living example of peaceful cooperation between two countries with different political, economic and social systems." The Chinese government and people will unswervingly strive to consolidate and develop the friendly relations between our two countries.

The Chinese government has always pursued a foreign policy of peace, advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and has made sincere and unremitting efforts to this end. As everyone knows, the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were first initiated by the Chinese government together with the governments of India and Burma in 1954. Since then, China has consistently advocated these principles in its diplomatic relations with various countries and has achieved good results. In 1955, China and Afghanistan jointly participated in the Bandung Conference, and I personally had the honor of meeting Your Honorable Naim during the Bandung Conference. We are pleased to point out that China and Afghanistan have always adhered to the spirit of the Bandung Conference, and the increasingly developing friendly relations between our two countries are a concrete manifestation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Not long ago, China signed a treaty of friendship and non-aggression and an agreement on the Sino-Burmese border issue with Burma, and a treaty of peace and friendship and an agreement on the Sino-Nepalese border issue with Nepal. These are all good examples of implementing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China not only sincerely hopes to live in harmony with all its neighbors, but also sincerely hopes that peace in Asia and the world can be guaranteed. To this end, the Chinese government has consistently supported the Soviet Union's proposals and actions on disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and other measures aimed at easing international tensions; the Chinese government has repeatedly suggested that countries in the Asian and Pacific region, including the United States, conclude a pact of non-aggression and peace, and make this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone. The Chinese government's foreign policy of peace is by no means an expedient measure, but has deep historical and social roots. Our socialist system determines the peaceful nature of our foreign policy. The Chinese people have always been a peace-loving people. The Chinese people have achieved their liberation through a long and arduous struggle, and are now building their country, determined to change the face of "poverty and backwardness," and are in great need of a peaceful international environment. It can be seen that China's foreign policy of peace is sincere, unwavering, and can stand the test of time. The People's Republic of China has never, and will never, invade or harm others. On the contrary, China is still suffering from aggression and harm from others to this day. In the struggle against aggression and for peace, the Chinese people need the sympathy and support of the people of all countries, and the Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the struggle of the people of all countries against aggression and for peace. The Chinese people are determined to unite with the Afghan people and the people of all countries in the world to continue to strive for and safeguard world peace.

Your Honorable Prime Minister Daoud, dear friends, our visit to your country this time is to express the Chinese people's deep friendship towards the Afghan people, enhance mutual understanding, and further strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. I firmly believe that in the years to come, our two countries' deep friendship and friendly cooperative relations, under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, will be continuously consolidated and developed, thereby making greater contributions to promoting the unity of Asian and African countries and maintaining world peace.

Finally, I invite you to join me in a toast:

To the eternal friendship between the people of China and Afghanistan,

To the prosperity of Afghanistan and the happiness of its people,

To peace in Asia and the world,

To the health of Your Honorable Deputy Prime Minister Sardar Mohammad Naim,

To the health of Your Honorable Deputy Prime Minister Ali Mohammad,

To the health of Your Honorable Prime Minister Sardar Mohammad Daoud,

To the health of His Majesty King Mohammad Zahir,

Cheers!

    中国坚定不移地奉行和平外交政策
    陈毅副总理在达乌德首相举行的宴会上的讲话
    新华社喀布尔21日电　陈毅副总理在阿富汗首相达乌德举行的宴会上的讲话全文：尊敬的达乌德首相殿下，尊敬的阿里·穆罕默德副首相阁下，尊敬的纳伊姆副首相殿下，亲爱的朋友们：
    感谢阿富汗王国政府和纳伊姆副首相殿下的盛情邀请，使我能够访问你们美好的国家。今天晚上，又承蒙达乌德首相殿下举行这样盛大的欢迎宴会，使我有机会同各位亲爱的朋友们欢聚一堂，我感到十分荣幸。后天就是阿富汗独立四十二周年的伟大节日。中国人民从自己切身的经历中，深深懂得独立的价值和意义，也完全理解人们在庆祝自己国家的独立时怀有多么兴奋的心情。在这个吉祥、欢乐的节日里，请允许我代表中国政府和人民，并且以我个人的名义，向你们，并且通过你们向英雄的阿富汗人民，表示诚挚的敬意和热烈的祝贺。
    几千年来，中国和阿富汗一直和睦相处。正如达乌德首相殿下说过的：“我们的关系从来没有被分歧和恶感所损害”。我们的祖先共同开辟了著名的“丝绸之路”，对促进两国人民的互相了解、沟通东西方的贸易来往和文化交流，曾经作出了重要的贡献。我们两国都曾遭受殖民主义的侵略，在对殖民主义侵略势力进行英勇斗争的年月里，两国人民也一直是互相关怀、互相同情的。在中华人民共和国成立以后，我们两国经过历史考验的友谊，又在新的基础上得到了新的发展。我们不会忘记，阿富汗是最早承认中华人民共和国的国家之一；阿富汗王国政府一贯主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位；阿富汗人民一直同情中国人民为维护国家主权和领土完整所进行的斗争。这是中国政府和人民深为感谢的。中国政府和人民对阿富汗王国政府所奉行的和平中立的外交政策，对于你们为促进各国人民友好、争取世界和平所作的努力，一直给予很高的评价和积极的支持。最近几年来，通过两国国家领导人的互相访问，通过各种文化、科学技术代表团的友好往来，我们两国之间的友好合作关系又不断有所加强。纳伊姆殿下去年访问我国时说得对，存在于我们两国之间的友好关系，是具有不同政治、经济和社会制度的两个国家和平合作的活的榜样。中国政府和人民将始终不渝地为巩固和发展我们两国的友好关系而努力。
    中国政府一贯奉行和平外交政策，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，并且坚持不懈地为此进行着真诚的努力。大家知道，著名的和平共处五项原则，就是中国政府同印度政府和缅甸政府在1954年首先倡导的。此后，中国在同各国的外交关系中，就一直倡导这些原则，并且获得了良好的成效。1955年，中国和阿富汗一起参加了万隆会议，我本人就是在万隆会议期间有幸同纳伊姆殿下结识的。我们满意地指出，中国和阿富汗始终遵循着万隆会议的精神，我们两国之间日益发展的友好关系，就是和平共处五项原则的具体体现。不久以前，中国同缅甸签订了友好互不侵犯条约和关于中缅边界问题的协定，同尼泊尔签订了和平友好条约和关于中尼边界问题的协定，这都是执行和平共处五项原则的良好范例。中国不仅诚心诚意地希望同自己所有的邻邦和睦相处，而且诚心诚意地希望亚洲和世界的和平也能得到保证。为此，中国政府一贯支持苏联关于裁军、禁止核武器以及其他旨在缓和国际紧张局势的倡议和行动；中国政府一再建议亚洲和太平洋地区各国，包括美国在内，缔结一个互不侵犯的和平公约，并且使这个地区成为无核子武器区。中国政府所奉行的和平外交政策，决不是一种权宜之计，而是有着深刻的历史和社会根源的。我国的社会主义制度决定了我国外交政策的和平性质。中国人民从来就是爱好和平的人民。中国人民经过长期艰苦的斗争，才取得自己的解放，现在正在建设着自己的国家，立志改变“一穷二白”的面貌，非常需要一个和平的国际环境。由此可见，中国的和平外交政策是真诚的，坚定不移的，是经得起时间的考验的。中华人民共和国从来没有、而且永远不会侵略和损害别人，相反，中国直到现在还遭受着别人的侵略和损害。在反对侵略和争取和平的斗争中，中国人民需要各国人民的同情和支持，中国人民也一贯同情和支持各国人民反对侵略和争取和平的斗争。中国人民决心同阿富汗人民和世界各国人民团结一致，继续为争取和维护世界和平而奋斗。
    尊敬的达乌德首相殿下，亲爱的朋友们，我们这次对贵国的访问，是为了表达中国人民对阿富汗人民的深厚友谊，增进彼此的了解，进一步加强两国的友好合作关系。我深信，在今后的年代里，我们两国的深厚友谊和友好合作关系，在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的指导下，必将不断地巩固和发展，从而对促进亚非各国的团结和维护世界的和平作出更大的贡献。
    最后，我请大家同我一起，
    为中国、阿富汗两国人民的永恒友谊，
    为阿富汗国家的繁荣和人民的幸福，
    为亚洲和世界的和平，
    为萨达尔·穆罕默德·纳伊姆副首相殿下的健康，
    为阿里·穆罕默德副首相阁下的健康，
    为萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德首相殿下的健康，
    为穆罕默德·查希尔国王陛下的健康，
    干杯！
