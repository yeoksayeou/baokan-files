Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 21st:  The 60,000 employees of Chongqing Steel Company are enthusiastically engaged in a production increase and economy drive centered on increasing steel production.

In recent days, employees in all units have summarized their experiences in completing state plans for the first seven months of this year, discussed plans for increasing production and practicing economy for the next four months, and measures to achieve these plans. Employees believe that there are many favorable conditions for completing this year's plan. The company's steel output in the first half of this year increased by 44.5% compared to the same period last year, and iron production more than doubled. The production situation in August is even better; in the first half of the month, compared with the same period in July, steel and iron production increased by 25% and 66% respectively. At the same time, the technological innovation and technological revolution movement has been deeply developed; many basic construction projects have been put into production; the political awareness and technical level of all employees have been greatly improved; and leading cadres have achieved great improvements and enhancements in their leadership style and mastery of production technology through "four togethers." The company's Party committee and the masses of employees are determined to use these favorable conditions to ensure the completion and over-completion of this year's production plan.

The company's Party committee has initially formulated a company-wide plan and measures for increasing production and practicing economy. Employees in all factories and mines have also formulated specific plans for completing production tasks on a monthly, weekly, daily, and furnace-by-furnace basis. The employees of Converter Plant No. 1 believe that although the task for the second half of the year is very heavy, as long as the converter lifespan and the melting rate of the cupola remain at the advanced levels that have already been achieved, they will be able to complete and over-fulfill this year's steel production plan. Therefore, all employees immediately studied and formulated measures. The cupola workers immediately cleaned Cupola No. 1, which had a low melting rate in the past, and replaced the tuyeres. The smelting and furnace building workers carried out a mass furnace protection campaign while also signing a contract with the refractory material factory to further improve the quality of refractory bricks, to jointly ensure the extension of the converter's lifespan. Now, the converter's furnace age has increased from twelve heats at the beginning of the month to more than twenty heats. The employees of Open Hearth Furnace Plant No. 2 formulated measures for six major production keys, such as reducing the sulfur content of pig iron and equipment maintenance. The employees of Open Hearth Furnace Plant No. 1 analyzed the existing open hearth furnace equipment and raw material supply and other conditions, and believed that the production potential was still great. As long as everyone carefully maintains the furnace, takes effective measures such as multi-charge smelting and continued comprehensive desulfurization operations, this year's national plan can be completed ahead of schedule, and a large amount of steel can be produced for the country. The employees said they would do it immediately. On the night of the plan discussion, the secretary of the factory's Party committee went deep into Cupola No. 3 and worked with the workers to carry out a variety of new comprehensive desulfurization techniques, using iron with a sulfur content of more than 0.5% to smelt high-grade quality steel. The employees of the other cupolas all earnestly studied the experience of Cupola No. 3, carried out comprehensive desulfurization, and generally improved desulfurization efficiency. At the same time, the steelmaking workers adopted a "two-step charging" method, which increased the steel output of each open hearth furnace by 20%. In order to solve the lime needed to increase steel production, Open Hearth Furnace Plant No. 2, at the suggestion of advanced producer Liu Shengyu, immediately launched a mass voluntary labor campaign to build three earth lime kilns using existing waste materials. Converter Plant No. 3, Ironmaking Plant, Rolling Mill and other plants also put forward plans for increasing production and practicing economy.

While enthusiastically discussing plans for increasing production and practicing economy, the employees immediately turned their determination into practical action. Factories and factories, teams and teams, furnaces and furnaces, and people and people all chose opponents to compete with each other and launched a competition. After the employees of Open Hearth Furnace Plant No. 1 put forward a plan to increase steel production this year, all the employees launched a competition of "one person contributes one idea, one group overcomes one difficulty." Sufficient gas is the key to rapid steelmaking and increased steel production. Under the leadership of the Communist Party members, this factory built an earth gas furnace in just a few days, increasing the gas supply. Employees in other factories also chased and helped each other in the competition.

In the new production increase and economy competition, the leading cadres of the entire company and various factories went deep into the front line, eating, living, working, and consulting with the broad masses of employees. Open Hearth Furnace Plant No. 1 implemented a furnace-front office system. Leading cadres such as Converter Plant No. 1 and Open Hearth Furnace Plant No. 2 insisted on the activity of one person participating in smelting one heat of qualified steel a day, and promptly discovered and solved problems in production.

This newspaper reported: The cadres at all levels of Beijing Steel Plant rushed to the production front line to grasp ideology and measures, setting off a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy. From August 1st to 19th, the average daily output of steel increased by 17.17% compared with July, the quality pass rate increased from 90% to more than 95%, and the consumption of pig iron per ton of steel was reduced by 250 kilograms.

The plant's steel output in the first seven months of this year increased by 56% compared with the same period last year, and it has cumulatively completed 73.8% of the annual plan. The broad masses of employees took advantage of the victory to advance, and since August, they have taken two powerful measures: First, cadres at all levels acted vigorously and rushed to the production front line. One-third of the factory's department cadres, more than 100 people, have been assigned to workshops as workers; 33 full-time veteran technicians have also returned to the steelmaking furnace from various posts to directly participate in production; 14 leading cadres have been assigned to workshops to work shifts, as furnace chiefs or steelmaking workers, greatly strengthening the strength of the production front line. Second, a large-scale discussion was held among all employees of the factory, and a conference of employee representatives was convened to mobilize the masses to summarize the production experience of the first seven months, analyze the current production situation, and formulate 60 major technical measures. The broad masses of employees are determined to complete and over-fulfill this year's plan ahead of schedule, and immediately took action to invest in a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy.

In this factory-wide discussion, the factory's Party committee and employees calculated an account: the steel ingots and steel materials produced by the factory this year will be supplied to more than 500 enterprises and units under 28 provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and 14 central ministries across the country. Whether Beijing Steel Plant can complete the plan ahead of schedule according to the contract is related to the production and construction of more than 500 fraternal units. This account greatly stimulated the workers' sense of responsibility as masters, and then the employees made a clear comparison between the current situation and August last year: last year, the converter did not have an auxiliary bay, and the cupola did not have hot blast, while this year, a new auxiliary bay and hot blast furnace have been built, greatly improving production conditions. Last year, workers could only smelt ordinary steel and some alloy steel, while this year, they have smelted a variety of alloy steel, and the technical level has also greatly improved. The employees saw that: under the conditions of last year, a great leap forward was achieved, and this year's conditions are even better. As long as the current favorable conditions are fully utilized, the continuous great leap forward this year can be achieved.

The broad masses of employees have put forward specific measures for increasing production and practicing economy, and more than 3,000 suggestions have been put forward. Through analysis and research, 60 major technical measures were formulated, and a vigorous offensive battle was organized to quickly set off a high-yield, high-quality, low-consumption production increase and economy competition. Currently, 24 of these 60 major technical measures have been implemented according to plan. Cadres at all levels and the broad masses of workers are united to solve hundreds of other new problems, promoting a substantial increase in the factory's steel output. Comparing the three five-day periods in the first half of August for converter steel output, the second five-day period increased by 27% compared with the first five-day period, and the third five-day period increased by 29% compared with the second five-day period. The utilization coefficient, quality, raw material consumption, cost and other indicators of the electric furnace have all maintained or reached the national advanced level. (Attached picture)

The workers of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Youth Group of Harbin Vehicle Factory, who had completed 15 months of production by August 14th, actively responded to the Party's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and invested in the competition for high-yield, high-quality, and safe production, determined to complete another 16 months of production tasks in the next four and a half months. This is them discussing the production tasks assigned by the workshop. Xinhua News Agency reporter Song Hui photographed.

    重庆钢铁公司和北京钢厂职工乘风破浪继续跃进
    按月按周按日制订计划保证完成全年任务
    新华社重庆21日电　重庆钢铁公司六万职工热烈地开展以增加钢产量为中心的增产节约运动。
    连日来，各单位职工都总结今年前七个月完成国家计划的经验，讨论今后四个多月的增产节约计划和实现这些计划的措施。职工们都认为完成今年计划有许多有利条件。全公司今年上半年的钢产量比去年同期增加了44.5％，铁增产了一倍以上；8月份全公司生产形势更好，上半个月与7月同期比较，钢铁产量分别增长了25％和66％。同时技术革新和技术革命运动已经深入开展; 许多基本建设工程投入了生产；全厂职工的政治觉悟和技术水平都大大提高；领导干部通过“四同”，在领导作风、掌握生产技术方面，都获得很大的改进和提高。公司党委和职工群众，决心利用这些有利条件，保证完成和超额完成今年的生产计划。
    公司党委已初步拟定了全公司的增产节约的计划和措施。各厂矿职工也都按月、按周、按日、按炉制订出完成生产任务的具体计划。转炉一厂职工在讨论中认为，下半年的任务虽然很重，但只要使转炉寿命和化铁炉熔铁率保持在目前己经达到过的先进水平上，就能够完成和超额完成今年的钢铁生产计划。因而全厂职工就立即研究和制定了措施。化铁炉工人立即将过去熔铁率不高的一号化铁炉进行了清洗，换了风口；冶炼和砌炉工人一面开展群众性的护炉运动，一面与耐火材料厂订了进一步提高耐火砖质量的合同，来共同保证延长转炉的寿命。现在，转炉炉龄已由月初的十二炉提高到二十炉以上。平炉二厂职工在讨论中，制定了降低生铁含硫率和设备维护等六大生产关键的措施。平炉一厂的职工分析了现有平炉设备和原料材料供应等情况，认为生产潜力还很大。只要人人精心维护好炉子，采取多装炼和继续贯彻综合脱硫操作等有效措施，今年可以提前完成国家计划，为国家增产大量的钢。职工们说干就干，在讨论计划的当天晚上，厂党委书记就深入到三号化铁炉，和工人一道大搞多种新技术的综合脱硫，用合硫0.5％以上的铁炼出了高级优质钢。其余几个化铁炉的职工，都认真学习三号化铁炉的经验，大搞综合脱硫, 普遍提高了脱硫效率。同时，炼钢工人采用了“两步装料”办法，每个平炉的钢产量提高了20％。平炉二厂为了解决增加钢产量所需要的石灰，在先进生产者刘声煜的倡议下，立即开展一个群众性的义务劳动，利用现存废旧材料修建三座土石灰窑。转炉三厂、炼铁厂、轧钢厂等也都分别提出了增产节约计划。
    职工们一边热烈讨论增产节约计划，一边立即把决心变为实际行动。厂与厂，班与班，炉与炉，人与人之间都互相选对手，开展了竞赛。平炉一厂的职工提出了今年增产钢的计划后，全厂职工开展了“一人献一计，一组攻一关”的竞赛。充足的煤气是进行快速炼钢增加钢产量的关键，这个厂在共产党员的带动下，仅用几天的时间就建起了一座土煤气炉，增加了煤气的供应量。其他各厂职工在竞赛中也互追互赶，互相帮助。
    在新的增产节约竞赛中，全公司和各厂的领导干部都深入第一线，与广大职工同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。平炉一厂实行了炉前办公制度。转炉一厂和平炉二厂等领导干部都坚持了一天一人参加炼一炉合格钢的活动，及时发现和解决了生产中的问题。
    本报讯　北京钢厂各级干部纷纷开赴生产第一线，抓思想，抓措施，掀起了一个增产节约新高潮。8月1日至19日钢的平均日产量比7月提高了17.17％，质量合格率由90％提高到95％以上，每炼一吨钢的生铁消耗降低了二百五十公斤。
    这个厂今年头7个月钢的产量比去年同期增长了56％，累计完成全年计划的73.8%。广大职工乘风破浪乘胜前进，8月以来采取了两项有力的措施：一、各级干部雷厉风行，开赴生产第一线。全厂已有三分之一的科室干部一百多人下放到车间当工人；三十三名脱产的老技术工人，也从各个岗位回到了炼钢炉旁直接参加生产；十四名领导干部下放到车间值班、当炉长或炼钢工：大大加强生产第一线的力量。二、举行全厂职工的大讨论，召开职工代表大会，发动群众总结前七个月的生产经验，分析当前的生产形势，制订了六十项重大技术措施，广大职工决心提前和超额完成今年的计划，并立即行动起来投入增产节约运动新高潮。
    在这次全厂性的大讨论中，工厂党委和职工们算了一笔账：这个厂今年生产的钢锭和钢材，要供应全国二十八个省、市、自治区和中央十四个部所属的五百多个企业单位使用，北京钢厂能不能提前按合同完成计划，关系到五百多个兄弟单位的生产和建设。这笔账大大激发了工人们的主人翁责任感，接着职工们又拿目前的情况和去年8月作了一个鲜明的比较：去年转炉没有付跨，化铁炉没有热风，而今年新建了付跨和热风炉，生产的条件大大改善了。去年，工人们只能炼普通钢和部分合金钢，而今年则冶炼了多种合金钢，技术水平也大大提高了；职工们看到：在去年的条件下，取得了大跃进，今年的条件更好，只要充分利用现在的有利条件就能夺取今年的继续大跃进。
    广大职工纷纷提出了增产节约的具体措施，已提出了三千多条意见。通过分析研究，制订了六十项重大技术措施，并且雷厉风行地组织攻关战役，迅速掀起高产、优质、低耗的增产节约竞赛。现在，这六十项重大技术措施已有二十四项按计划开始实施。各级干部和广大工人团结一致，解决了其他数以百计的新问题，促使全厂钢产量大幅度上升。以转炉钢产量8月上半月的三个五天作比较，第二个五天比第一个五天提高27％，第三个五天又比第二个五天提高了29％，电炉的利用系数、质量、原材料消耗、成本等指标，都保持或达到全国先进水平。（附图片）
    到八月十四日已完成十五个月生产量的哈尔滨车辆厂中苏友谊青年小组工人，积极响应党的增产节约的号召，投入了高产、优质、安全生产的竞赛运动，决心在今后的四个半月中再完成十六个月的生产任务。这是他们在讨论车间下达的生产任务。新华社记者宋挥摄
