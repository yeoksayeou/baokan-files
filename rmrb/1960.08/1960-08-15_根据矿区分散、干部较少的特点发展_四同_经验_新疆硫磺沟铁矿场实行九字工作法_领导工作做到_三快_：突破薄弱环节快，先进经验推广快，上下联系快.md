Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi. The General Party Branch of the Sulfur Gulch Iron Mine of the Xinjiang August 1st Iron and Steel Plant recently summarized and developed the "Four Together System" leadership method into the "Nine-Character Work Method" of "One Pole," "One String," and "Two Stalls," in response to the characteristics of the scattered mines and fewer cadres.

"One Pole" means that under the unified leadership of the mine's General Party Branch, all cadres in the mine are assigned areas of responsibility, responsible for ideology, production, and living, with one pole inserted all the way to the bottom; "One String" means that the leaders on duty are linked to commanders at all levels according to the business system, from the mine and work section to the work site, with one link connected to another, exchanging information and promoting experience at any time; "Two Stalls" means that the cadres of various business departments are divided into "two stalls," one going deep into the grassroots and the other staying at home, rotating up and down.

After adopting the above practices, the General Party Branch twisted the strength of all aspects of the mine into one rope, achieving a response to every call. Now, the mine's leadership work has rapidly changed from the past "three more" and "three slow" to "three less" and "three fast": fewer meetings, less time sitting in the office, fewer reports; quick breakthrough of weak links in production, quick promotion of advanced experience, and quick communication between higher and lower levels.

Sulfur Gulch Iron Mine was originally a small iron mine with poor equipment and scattered mining points. As early as February of last year, Yan Guicai, Secretary of the Mine's General Party Branch, and several mine managers took the lead in eating, living, working, and consulting with the workers. Subsequently, the Mine's General Party Branch made a resolution that all cadres in the mine should spend half of their time each month participating in labor and half of their time handling business, and this system was used as an important criterion for evaluating the work of cadres. In implementing this resolution, cadres at all levels took the production site as their base, learning technology while working, and conducting investigations and research, discovering and solving problems in a timely manner. However, after the cadres went deep into the front line, there was a busy and uncoordinated phenomenon in the work above; the newly implemented "Nine-Character Work Method" was created by the mine's leading cadres to eliminate this phenomenon.

Due to the long-term adherence to the "Four Together" system with workers, the leading cadres of the Sulfur Gulch Iron Mine not only quickly improved themselves, but also further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, promoting continuous production increases. Therefore, the entire mine reversed its past backwardness and became a red flag in the autonomous region's mining industry.

    根据矿区分散、干部较少的特点发展“四同”经验
    新疆硫磺沟铁矿场实行九字工作法
    领导工作做到“三快”：突破薄弱环节快，先进经验推广快，上下联系快
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆八一钢铁厂硫磺沟铁矿场党总支最近针对矿区分散、干部较少的特点，把“四同制”领导方法总结发展为“一竿子”、“一串子”、“两摊子”的“九字工作法”。
    “一竿子”是，在矿总支的统一领导下，全矿干部分片包干，包思想、包生产、包生活，一竿子插到底；“一串子”是，值班领导人员按业务系统同各级指挥员层层挂钩，从矿、工段到工作现场，一环扣一环，随时交换情况，推广经验；“两摊子”是，把各业务部门的干部分成深入基层和留在家里的“两摊子”，上下轮流。
    采用以上的做法以后，党总支把全矿各方面的力量拧成了一股绳，做到了一呼百应。现在这个矿的领导工作已经由过去的“三多”、“三慢”迅速转变为“三少”、“三快”：会议少，坐办公室少，报表少；突破生产薄弱环节快，先进经验推广快，上下联系快。
    硫磺沟铁矿原是个小型铁矿，设备差，矿点分散。早在去年2月，矿场党总支书记阎贵财和几个矿长以身作则，同工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。此后矿场党总支又作出全矿干部每月一半时间参加劳动、一半时间处理业务的决议，并且把这项制度作为评比干部工作的重要标准。各级干部在执行这项决议中，都以生产现场为基地，边劳动、边学技术、边调查研究，及时发现问题，解决问题。但是在干部深入第一线之后，上面的工作却发生了不相适应的忙乱现象；新近推行的“九字工作法”，就是矿上的领导干部为消除这种现象而创造出来的。
    硫磺沟铁矿场的领导干部由于长期坚持了跟工人“四同”的制度，不仅迅速提高了自己，而且进一步密切了干群关系，促进生产持续上升。因此，全矿一反过去的落后面貌，成了自治区采掘工业中的一面红旗。
