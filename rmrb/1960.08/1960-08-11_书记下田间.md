Secretary Goes to the Fields

　　Early in the morning, the secretary goes to the fields,
　　Coming to the fields for a careful look,
　　Like a mother looking at her child,
　　Thinking comprehensively about what's lacking and what needs supplementing.

　　"Delicacies from the mountains and seas" are sent to the fields,
　　Fertilizer carts run ahead,
　　The secretary takes the lead as a vanguard,
　　Making the seedlings grow green and full in the fields.

　　The sun sets and the sky darkens,
　　The secretary is busy checking the field water,
　　Drawing in clear water to irrigate the good fields,
　　Making every paddy field full of good water.

　　The moonlight shines brightly through the window,
　　The secretary is still busy under the lamp,
　　Carefully making good plans,
　　To promote the rapid growth of the seedlings!

### 书记下田间

    书记下田间
    清早书记下田间，
    来在田间细细看，
    好像母亲看孩儿，
    缺啥补啥想周全。
    “山珍海味”送下田，
    运肥车子跑在前，
    书记领头当尖兵，
    禾苗长得青满田。
    日头落山天色暗，
    书记忙把田水看，
    引来清水灌良田，
    丘丘好水满了田。
    月亮光光透进窗，
    书记还在灯下忙，
    细细来作好计划，
    促进禾苗快快长！
