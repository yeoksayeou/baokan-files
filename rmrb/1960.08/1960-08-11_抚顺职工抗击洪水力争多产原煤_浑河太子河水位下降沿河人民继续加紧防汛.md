Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 10th - Fushun coal mine workers have achieved preliminary victory in the struggle against the extraordinary flood unseen in decades. During the period of torrential rain and mountain flood invasion, Longfeng Mine, Shengli Mine, and West Open-Pit Mine under this mining area have been insisting on continuous production; most of the temporarily suspended coal mining workfaces have also gradually resumed production since the 5th. The production of the Laohutai Mine, which was less affected by the rainstorm, has been continuously improving. At present, the workers of the entire mining area are both continuing to persist in the struggle against flood and striving to turn the rainy August into a month of large-scale high production, and striving to produce more coal to support the needs of steel industry in various regions.

The Fushun Coal Mine has experienced flood threats that have never occurred in the fifty years since the establishment of the mine. During the continuous torrential rains from the 1st to the 4th, the Hun River, Dongzhou River, and Guchengzi River near the mining area flooded, and some embankments were in danger; the water accumulation in the West Open-Pit Mine was very large, and the underground water inflow of the coal mines operating underground was greatly increased due to the seepage of rainwater from the ground. During the period when the flood was severely threatening, the main leading cadres of the Fushun Municipal Party Committee and the Party committees at all levels in the mining area personally directed the flood prevention and rescue struggle, concentrating superior forces to resist the flood attack. They, together with the masses, fought day and night in the front line of flood prevention and rescue.

Under the strong leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and the Party committees of various mines, the broad masses of coal mine workers, together with the people of the city, demonstrated a spirit of heroism and fearlessness in the flood prevention and rescue struggle. Many coal mine workers were on duty for production and off duty for flood prevention. On the morning of the 4th, the Dongzhou River Dam near Longfeng Mine was in urgent condition due to a mountain flood. More than 2,000 workers and family members of Longfeng Mine rushed to the rescue upon hearing the news. Dong Rui, the deputy leader of the tunnel gang of the Lianken Pit and a Communist Party member, first carried a 100-jin bag of sand towards the overflowing area of the flood, was knocked down by the oncoming wave, but he got up and continued to rush towards the embankment; the first sandbag thrown down was swept away by the flood, so he took the second sandbag from his companions, riding the sandbag with his whole body to resist the flood impact. At this critical moment, the masses who followed arrived and finally stopped the overflowing flood and raised the dam by one and a half meters. On the night of the 1st, when the extraordinary rainstorm just arrived, the Party secretaries and mine managers of coal mines such as Laohutai Mine and Shengli Mine personally led the masses to build waterproof dams as high as one or two meters around the wellheads, preventing floodwater from entering the well. The West Open-Pit Mine, which had the most accumulated water, set up four powerful waterproof and drainage lines, which greatly reduced the flood threat and insisted on production. Now, the production level of the coal mining workfaces that have resumed production is improving day and night. The daily output of raw coal, oil shale, and other products of the West Open-Pit Mine has approached the level of late July. The raw coal output of the entire mining area on the 6th increased by 27% compared with the 3rd, and the average daily output of the 7th, 8th, and 9th increased by 14.6% compared with the 6th.

In order to transport the raw coal out in time to support steel enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel, the workers of the Fushun Railway and Mining Transportation Department also stuck to the railway transportation line of the coal capital under the attack of rainstorms, and worked hard to fight the floods and rush to transport coking coal. The flood prevention and rescue army composed of more than 2,000 people led by leading cadres in separate groups went to various important construction sites on the transportation line of the mining area, and maintained all culverts, bridges, and communication equipment along the line day and night. From August to the 9th, the workers of the road and mining transportation department of this mining area have transported more than 3,900 trucks of high-quality coking coal and raw coal for steel enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel, and at the same time rushed to transport more than 1,000 trucks of rescue materials to support the city's flood prevention and rescue.

While strengthening the flood prevention and production front, each mine has designated a deputy secretary and a deputy mine manager to take charge of the lives of the workers. Some of the workers' dormitories that were damaged by the rainstorms are currently being renovated at an accelerated pace, and the affected workers' families have been properly resettled.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th - In the eastern part of Liaoning Province, which has been continuously raining since August, the weather began to clear on the 9th, and the flood peaks of the Hun River and Taizi River, which were once surging and roaring, have converged into the Liao River and are advancing towards the Liaohekou via Sanchahe. The water levels of the two rivers are falling. However, according to the forecast, there will still be rain in the southern and eastern regions on the 12th and 13th, and people in various places are preparing to fight against possible new floods.

In the eastern part of Liaoning Province, after continuous heavy rains from the 1st to the 5th, some rain continued to fall, but in the past few days, the rainfall in the Hun River and Taizi River basins has not been large. Affected by the Mongolian cold air, there was widespread rainfall in the eastern and southern regions of Liaoning on the 8th, and some regions had heavy rain again. After 8 o'clock on the 9th, the weather in the province turned clear except for Huanren, and according to meteorological forecasts, there will be no rain in the next one or two days, and there will still be rain on the 12th and 13th.

The water levels of the Hun River and Taizi River have gradually fallen after the rainstorm. On the afternoon of the 5th, the water level at Liaoyang Station on the Taizi River had fallen below the guaranteed water level, and on the 6th, it fell below the warning water level. On the morning of the 9th, the water level at Fushun Station on the Hun River also fell below the guaranteed water level. After the flood peaks of the two rivers entered the Liao River, the Sanchahe Station of the Liao River saw a flood peak on the night of the 8th, with a flood peak water level of 6.38 meters. The water level has tended to fall on the 9th, but the water level is still above the guaranteed water level on the 10th. Now the flood peak is discharging towards Yingkou via Sanchahe. Due to the large amount of water, the water level is receding relatively slowly.

    抚顺职工抗击洪水力争多产原煤
    浑河太子河水位下降沿河人民继续加紧防汛
    新华社抚顺10日电　抚顺煤矿职工抗击几十年未有的特大洪水斗争，已经取得了初步胜利。这个矿区所属的龙凤矿、胜利矿、西露天矿，在暴雨和山洪侵袭期间，一直坚持生产不停；暂时停产的一些采煤工作面，从5日起也绝大部分陆续恢复生产。受暴雨影响较小的老虎台矿，生产不断提高。目前，全矿区职工正在一面继续坚持防汛抗洪斗争，一面力争变多雨的8月为大面积高产月，力争生产更多的煤炭支援各地钢铁工业的需要。
    抚顺煤矿这次经受了从建矿五十年来从未有过的洪水威胁。在1日到4日连降暴雨期间，矿区附近浑河、东洲河、古城子河洪水暴涨，部分堤坝出险；西露天矿坑内积水很大，各井下作业的煤矿也因地面雨水下渗，大大增加了地下涌水量。在洪水严重威胁期间，中共抚顺市委和矿区各级党委主要领导干部都亲自指挥防汛抢险斗争，集中优势力量抵御洪水的袭击。他们和群众一道，日夜冒雨奋战在抗洪防汛前线。
    在市委和各矿党委的坚强领导下，广大煤矿职工同全市人民一起，在抗洪抢险斗争中表现了奋不顾身的英雄气概。许多煤矿职工都当班生产，休班防汛。4日早晨龙凤矿附近的东洲河大坝因山洪暴发告急，龙凤矿两千多名工人和职工家属闻讯都赶往抢险。搭连坑井巷班副班长、共产党员董瑞首先扛起一袋百斤重的沙袋向洪水漫堤处奔去，被迎面而来的浪头打倒了，他又爬起来继续向堤坝冲去；投掷下去的第一个沙袋被洪水卷走了，他就从伙伴们手中接过第二个沙袋，用整个身体骑在沙袋上，抵御着洪水冲击。正当这紧急关头，随后而来的群众赶到，终于挡住了漫堤的洪水，把堤坝加高了一米半。1日深夜，特大暴雨刚刚到来的时候，老虎台矿、胜利矿等煤矿的党委书记、矿长就亲自率领群众，在井口周围垒起一条条高达一、两米的防水坝，阻止了洪水注入井下。积水最多的西露天矿，摆下了四条强有力的防水排水线，大大减轻了洪水威胁，坚持了生产。现在，已经恢复生产的采煤工作面，生产水平都在日夜提高。西露天矿的原煤、油母页岩等日产量都已接近7月下旬的水平。全矿区6日的原煤产量比3日提高27％，7、8、9日三天的平均日产量又比6日提高14.6％。
    为了把原煤及时运出支援鞍钢等钢铁企业，抚顺路矿运输部门职工也在暴雨袭击下坚守煤都的铁路运输线，奋力抗洪抢险，赶运焦煤。由领导干部分头率领两千多人组成的防汛抗洪大军，开赴矿区运输线的各个险要工地，日夜维护沿线所有的涵洞、桥梁和通讯设备。8月份到9日止，这个矿区的路矿运输部门职工已为鞍钢等钢铁企业运出优质炼焦煤和原煤三千九百多车，同时赶运了一千多车抢险物资，支援全市抗洪抢险。
    各矿在加强防汛和生产战线的同时，都确定一名副书记、一名副矿长来抓职工生活。一部分被暴雨冲坏的职工宿舍，目前正在加速整修，受灾的职工家属都得到了妥善安置。
    据新华社沈阳10日电　8月以来连续阴雨的辽宁省东部地区，9日天气开始放晴，一度汹涌咆哮的浑河、太子河的洪峰，已于辽河汇流，正经三岔河向辽河口推进，两河水势都在下落。但据预报12、13两日南部、东部地区仍然有雨，各地人民正准备同可能出现的新汛情作斗争。
    辽宁省东部地区，在1日到5日连降大暴雨后，也继续下了些雨，但几天来浑河、太子河流域的雨量都不大。8日受蒙古冷空气影响，辽宁东部南部地区曾经普遍降雨，有些地区又下了暴雨。9日八点以后，除桓仁还有雨外，全省天气转晴，据气象预报一、两天内无雨，12、13两日仍有雨。
    浑河、太子河的水势，在暴雨过后都徐徐下落。5日下午，太子河上的辽阳站水位已回落到保证水位以下，6日回落到警戒水位以下。9日晨，浑河上的抚顺站的水位也下降到保证水位以下。两河洪峰进入辽河后，辽河三岔河站于8日夜出现洪峰，洪峰水位达六点三八米，9日水势已趋下落，但到10日水位仍在保证水位以上。现在洪峰正经三岔河向营口方向下泄，由于水量大，水位消退比较缓慢。
