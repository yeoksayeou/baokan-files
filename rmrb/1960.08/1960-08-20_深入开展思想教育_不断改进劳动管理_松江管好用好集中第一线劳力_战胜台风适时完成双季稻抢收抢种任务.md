(Reported by our newspaper in Shanghai on August 19th) Songjiang County in Shanghai is focusing on ideological and organizational work, mobilizing the enthusiasm of both "old soldiers" (original commune members on the agricultural front) and "new soldiers" (commune members recently transferred to the agricultural front), further leveraging their strong fighting power.

Songjiang County is a famous rice-producing area. To increase grain production further, since early July, the county party committee has transferred a large number of personnel from industry, finance and trade, culture and education, and other departments to support the agricultural front. Communes have also transferred 6,200 people from commune-run industries, basic construction, culture, education, health, collective welfare, and other areas to the agricultural front. As a result, the total labor force directly engaged in agricultural production in the county has reached 121,000, an increase of over 9,300 from the previous period. At the same time, various sectors have also dispatched a large number of personnel for short-term support, greatly strengthening the grain production front.

After investigation, the Songjiang County Party Committee learned that the labor force transferred from various sectors played a significant role in ensuring agricultural priorities. However, compared with the original commune members on the agricultural front, they were still a minority, and many were new to agriculture. Therefore, educating the old soldiers, enhancing their production enthusiasm, organizing this basic force better, and fully exploiting their labor potential are extremely important. Therefore, the County Party Committee decided to vigorously strengthen ideological education while continuously improving labor organization and management, so that the enthusiasm of both new and old soldiers could be fully utilized.

According to the instructions of the County Party Committee, more than 1,000 commune committee members on the front line of production went deep into the production teams, propagandizing the principle of taking grain as the key link to the masses, educating commune members to seize the critical period of crop growth, manage and care for crops meticulously, and ensure increased grain yields. At the same time, they combined this with the selection of "Five-Good Commune Members" to establish advanced models. They also took the initiative to help the new soldiers who had just been transferred back to the agricultural front to solve production and life difficulties. Fan Xiqi, the party branch secretary of the Xinsheng Production Team in Chengdong Commune, visited Zhang Yousheng, who had been newly transferred back from the commune livestock farm, and introduced him to the favorable conditions and long-term plans for the production team's further development of production. Zhang Yousheng was greatly encouraged and was the first to go to work every day and carefully checked the quality of operations when he finished work. He was actively responsible in various productions and became one of the mainstays of the team.

After the strength of the agricultural frontline was strengthened, the party committee secretaries of each commune personally went to the production teams to help grassroots cadres improve labor management and improve command capabilities.

The communes and production teams strengthened the organization of labor in the following aspects:

(1) Rationally organize the newly added forces and make full use of support forces. The "new soldiers" transferred from all sides were immediately incorporated into work groups and assigned tasks according to their strengths; appropriate consideration was given when assigning tasks to those who had been away from agricultural production for a long time: from light to heavy, from simple to complex. When workers from county and commune factories, teachers and students from primary and secondary schools, and urban residents provided short-term support to agricultural production, the supporting units contacted the production teams they were linked with in advance to determine the projects to be participated in based on the technical level and labor strength of the supporting personnel. They adopted the methods of dividing projects, contracting areas, or dividing projects, setting tasks, and incorporating them into work groups of production teams, so that people and tasks were suitable and tasks were clear.

(2) In addition to a number of cadres in each commune and production team creating typical experiences in advanced teams to "skillfully use troops," most cadres went deep into backward teams to help improve labor management. Chen Boxian, deputy director of the Fengwei Commune, after settling in the Shengxin Team, which had a slower production progress, participated in production in the third team, which had the slowest production in this team, every day, helped this team formulate daily and ten-day production plans, adjusted the work groups, revised labor quotas according to the weight of the farm work, and improved the work evaluation and scoring system. The enthusiasm of the commune members was greatly improved, and the production outlook of this team quickly changed. Based on the experience of the third team, Chen Boxian comprehensively rectified the labor management of the entire production team, and labor efficiency generally increased by more than 30%. In the rush to harvest and plant, the Shengxin Team completed the late rice transplanting task three days ahead of schedule, catching up with the advanced teams.

(3) Concentrate forces to tackle key farm work and organize collaboration to support backward areas. The late rice planted by the sixth team of the Xuejia Production Team in Chengxi Commune had many weeds, and the development of rice seedlings was affected. The party branch organized a group of commune members from the three teams with faster production progress to support the sixth team, and after a three-day blitz, the weeds in the rice fields were quickly removed.

After Songjiang County adopted the above measures, the strength of the new and old soldiers merged on the agricultural front was enhanced, their enthusiasm was improved, and coupled with flexible command and leadership by cadres, a production upsurge was quickly set off. In the situation where typhoons, rainstorms, and major floods simultaneously invaded the county, relying on this strong front, the county successfully completed the rush to harvest and plant double-cropped rice. 94,000 mu of early rice was rushed to be harvested during the wind and rain, basically ensuring that the grains were returned to the barn. At the same time, more than 100,000 mu of double-cropped rice was rushed to be planted, an increase of 20% compared to last year and more than 6,000 mu more than the original plan. After finishing the first weeding of 610,000 mu of single-cropped late rice in the county, 30% of the rice fields were weeded a second time, and other tasks were done very well.

    深入开展思想教育　不断改进劳动管理
    松江管好用好集中第一线劳力
    战胜台风适时完成双季稻抢收抢种任务
    本报上海19日电　上海市松江县抓紧思想工作和组织工作，把“老战士”（原来在农业战线上的社员）和“新战士”（最近调到农业战线的社员）的积极性同时调动起来，更加发挥了坚强的战斗力。
    松江县是著名的水稻产区。为了增产更多的粮食，从7月上旬到现在，县委已从工业、财贸、文教等部门抽调大批人力支援农业战线，各公社也从社办工业、基本建设、文教卫生、集体福利等各个方面，调出六千二百多人，转移到农业战线上去。这样，全县直接参加农业生产的劳动力，已达到十二万一千多人，比前一时期增加了九千三百多人。同时，各行各业还抽出大批人员，短期支援，大大加强了粮食生产战线。
    松江县委经过调查，了解到各行各业抽调出来的劳力，对保证农业重点，作用很大。但是，同原来在农业战线上的社员比较，他们毕竟还是少数，而且不少人是农业新手。因此，教育老战士，提高老战士的生产积极性，把原来这支基本队伍组织得更好，充分发挥他们的劳动潜力十分重要。因此县委决定在不断改善劳动组织、加强劳动管理的同时，大力加强思想教育工作，同时把新、老战士的积极性充分发挥出来。
    根据县委的指示，全县在生产第一线的一千多个公社党委委员深入生产小队，向群众宣传以粮为纲的方针，教育社员抓住作物生长的关键时期，管好、管细、保证多收粮食。同时结合评选“五好社员”，树立先进标兵。对刚调回农业战线的新战士，还主动帮助他们解决生产和生活上的困难。城东公社新生生产队党支部书记范锡祺，登门访问了由公社种畜场新调回的张友生，向他介绍生产队进一步发展生产的有利条件和远景规划。张友生受到很大鼓舞，每天出工最早，收工时还仔细检查操作质量，在各项生产中积极负责，成为队里主要骨干之一。
    农业第一线力量加强后，各个公社党委书记都亲自下到生产队，帮助基层干部改进劳动管理，提高指挥能力。
    各个公社、生产队从以下几方面加强了劳动力的组织工作。
    （一）合理组织新增加的兵力和充分利用支援力量。由各方面调回的“新战士”，都立即编入作业小组，并根据各人的特长分配任务；对离开农业生产时间较长的，在分配任务时还适当照顾：由轻到重，由简到繁。县、社工厂工人、中小学师生和城镇居民等短期支援农业生产时，支援单位事先和挂钩的生产队联系，根据支援人员的技术水平和劳力强弱，确定参加生产的项目。并采取分项目、包面积或分项目、定任务、编入生产队作业小组的办法，做到人、事相宜，任务明确。
    （二）各个公社、生产队除了有一部分干部在先进小队创造“巧用兵”的典型经验外，大部分干部深入落后队，帮助改进劳动管理。枫围公社副主任陈伯贤在生产进度较慢的盛新队落户后，每天到这个队生产最慢的第三小队参加生产，帮助这个小队制订了每天、每旬的生产计划，调整好作业小组，按农活的轻重，修订劳动定额，改进评工记分制度，社员的劳动积极性大大提高，这个小队的生产面貌就很快得到改变。陈伯贤又根据第三小队的经验，把全生产队的劳动管理作了全面整顿，劳动效率普遍提高30％以上。在抢收抢种中，盛新队提前三天完成了晚稻插秧任务，赶上了先进队。
    （三）集中力量突击重点农活，组织协作支援后进地区。城西公社薛家生产队第六小队种的晚稻，杂草多，稻苗发棵受到影响。党支部从生产进度较快的三个小队中，组织一批社员支援第六小队，突击三天，很快把稻田的杂草除净。
    松江县采取上述措施后，新老战士汇合在农业第一线上的力量增强了，积极性提高了，加上干部指挥灵活，领导有方，因而迅速掀起了生产高潮。全县在台风暴雨大汛同时侵袭的情况下，依托这一条坚强阵线，胜利完成了双季稻的抢收抢种。九万四千亩早稻在风雨期间，突击抢收完毕，基本上做到颗粒归仓。同时，抢种了十万多亩双季后作稻，比去年扩大了20％，比原定计划也多种了六千多亩。全县六十一万亩单季晚稻在结束头遍耘耥后，又有30％的稻田进行了第二遍耘耥，其他各项工作，都做得很出色。
