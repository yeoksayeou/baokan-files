    Intercropping Trees and Grain: A Triple Win

    In 1958 and 1959, the country afforested more than 200 million mu each year; this spring, various parts of the country have again cultivated large areas of young forests. Our country has so many young forests, which is a great thing. We must carefully nurture them so that they can grow sturdily. However, nurturing young forests requires a lot of labor, so how to rationally arrange labor between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry to achieve a triple win for agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry is a very important issue. The best way to solve these problems is intercropping trees and grain—planting grain crops, oil crops, melons, vegetables, and forage crops in young forest land. In this way, cultivation can be used in place of nurturing, allowing trees and crops to grow together, and agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry to reap a bumper harvest together. This is the most rational comprehensive utilization of labor and land, and a correct path for the high-speed development of the mountain economy.

    There are many benefits to intercropping trees and grain. After planting various crops in the forest land, the nurturing of trees is carried out while managing the crops in the field, which can loosen the soil and conserve moisture, and prevent young trees from being bullied by weeds. Cultivation in forest land is also conducive to the transformation and ripening of the soil; plowing the roots, stems, and leaves of interplanted crops into the soil can increase the organic matter in the soil; especially intercropping leguminous crops can use the nitrogen fixation of rhizobia to increase the nitrogen content in the soil. The root systems of trees and the root systems of crops are distributed in different soil layers, which can make the nutrients in different soil layers fully function. When the trees are very small, crops provide shade for them, making them less susceptible to sunscald and wind erosion, and can also reduce water evaporation. As long as the trees and interplanted crops are matched according to their respective characteristics, they can all grow well at the same time.

    Intercropping trees and grain is very beneficial to the growth of young forests. According to investigations, under the same soil and climatic conditions, the growth rate of trees in intercropped forests is generally about twice as fast as that of trees in non-intercropped forests in the first ten years. Jinping County, Guizhou Province, which is famous for creating advanced experience in fast-growing and high-yielding forests, has always paid attention to intercropping trees and grain; the county's eight-year-old fir forests are all cultivated on intercropped land. Huashi Commune in Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, intercropped grain in young fir forests, with a yield of more than 200 jin per mu, and the fir trees grew particularly well, reaching about five chi in height; fir trees planted in the same year that were not intercropped were only more than one chi high. Intercropping can also make trees profitable earlier and improve quality. Qu County, Zhejiang Province, has more than 6,000 mu of oil tea trees that have been intercropped, which began to blossom and bear fruit in three years; the tea seeds produced by the oil tea forest intercropped by Zhangcun Commune in Qingtian County increased the oil yield from 25% to 42%.

    Not only young forest land can be intercropped, but also some mature forest land can be greatly benefited by intercropping. Last year, the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province intercropped grain crops in 460,000 mu of tung oil and oil tea forests, harvesting 59.5 million jin of grain (the intercropped area accounted for about 8% of the total intercropped area in the prefecture, and the harvested grain accounted for about 5% of the total grain output of the prefecture); at the same time, tung oil and tea oil also achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. Last year, Shouche Commune in Yongshun County of this prefecture doubled its tung oil and tea oil production by intercropping trees and grain, and the harvested miscellaneous grains accounted for 27% of the commune's grain output. The members happily sang: "Oil above, grain below, a happy life forever."

    Intercropping trees and grain is also the best way for areas with more mountains and less land and pastoral areas to achieve self-sufficiency in grain. Forty-nine counties in the mountainous areas of Hunan Province originally lacked grain. After implementing intercropping trees and grain and other cultivation system reforms, all of them achieved self-sufficiency or surplus in grain last year. Songcun Production Team of Xiahu Commune in Kaihua County, Zhejiang Province, used to lack more than 70,000 jin of grain a year; after intercropping grain in the forest land, they now have a surplus of more than 60,000 jin; at the same time, many old tung forests have regained their youth, and the production of oil tea seeds has also more than doubled. Last year, the Heidaigou Forest Farm of Jungar Banner, Ikezhao League, Inner Mongolia, intercropped trees and grain, earning more than 30,000 jin of grain, more than 3,000 jin of oil, and more than 18,000 jin of tubers, and also produced many vegetables, achieving self-sufficiency in grain, oil, and vegetables, and also raised more than 100 pigs and sheep.

    No matter from which aspect, intercropping trees and grain is a good thing, worthy of universal promotion and great effort. As long as the Party committees at all levels in the forest area and the commune leaders see this way, seize the current favorable opportunity, make up their minds to do it, mobilize the masses to do it, and do it themselves, intercropping trees and grain will definitely be done more and better. This spring, Jinping County, Guizhou Province, has already intercropped more than 500,000 mu of grain crops in forest land. Last year, the county intercropped nearly 250,000 mu of grain crops in forest land, with an average yield of 400 jin per mu; if it is still calculated at a yield of 400 jin of grain per mu this year, it can get 200 million jin of grain from the forest land. The Jinping County Party Committee fully recognizes the great importance of this matter; as early as the winter afforestation, the Party secretaries at all levels went to the mountains with the masses to lead the masses to carry out strip tillage and comprehensive tillage afforestation, and deeply plowed the land, creating favorable conditions for intercropping trees and grain. The County Party Committee also planted experimental fields for intercropping trees and grain in fast-growing, high-yielding experimental forests, gained experience, and promoted it universally. All communes in the county organized tens of thousands of troops for intercropping trees and grain, bringing cattle and farm tools, and setting up camps on the mountains; from the commune Party committee to the production team Party branch, they all planted high-yield experimental slopes for intercropping trees and grain. Therefore, the masses are in high spirits and compete with each other to turn large areas of ten thousand mu of high-yield forests into grain-producing mountains at the same time. The facts in many places have proved that as long as we make overall arrangements according to the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, seize favorable opportunities, and launch mass movements, difficulties such as lack of labor can be overcome. In many places in Zhejiang and Hunan, it is precisely in the mass movement of vigorously carrying out intercropping trees and grain that many new technologies and new tools for reclaiming mountain forests and forest land field management have been created, and manual reclamation and management have been transformed into animal power and new-style tool reclamation and management, saving a lot of labor and realizing large-scale intercropping of trees and grain. At the same time, it has created conditions for the mechanization and semi-mechanization of mountainous areas and forest areas in the future.

    Wherever forest farms are established, intercropping trees and grain is done well; at the same time, the rapid benefits from grain, oil, and vegetables in intercropping also make the forest farms more consolidated. Therefore, in order to do a good job in intercropping trees and grain, we must better and universally promote the "three modernizations" of forestry, that is, the base of forestry production, the forest farm of forestry management, and the fast-growing and high-yielding of tree cultivation. Within a certain period of time, the forestry base is also the grain base, and the management of crops on the forest land can generally be undertaken by the professional teams of the forest farm. To achieve a triple harvest of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, we must carry forward the style of seeking truth from facts, carefully investigate and study, master the growth and development laws of various trees and various crops in various regions, and seek the most appropriate intercropping methods for different trees and different crops in different seasons. Technical arrangements must be closely coordinated with organizational arrangements. Most of the crops intercropped in forest land are miscellaneous grains, beans, tubers, melons, vegetables, etc. There are many varieties of these crops, and the sowing periods are different, which is a good condition for allocating labor and arranging stubble. As long as we carefully study and cleverly arrange, we can make the limited human and land resources play a greater role.

    There are hundreds of millions of mu of new forest land, and the open space in many mature forests can also be intercropped, and the area is very large. Even if some forest land is not suitable for full intercropping due to various conditions, if we calculate 150 million mu of intercropping and a grain yield of 100 jin per mu, we can get 15 billion jin of grain. Guizhou has already intercropped more than 15 million mu of trees and grain; Hunan has already intercropped more than 11 million mu of trees and grain; and many other provinces and autonomous regions are also vigorously carrying out intercropping of trees and grain. There is still a lot of forest land that can be intercropped but has not yet been intercropped in various regions, and the enthusiasm of the masses to develop mountain land is also very high. The further consolidation and strengthening of the people's communes has created extremely favorable conditions for the organized and planned large-scale development of mountain areas and forest areas and the implementation of intercropping trees and grain. As long as we strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and guide the enthusiasm of the masses in the vast forest area to intercropping trees and grain, we will definitely be able to achieve great harvests this year. This good thing that benefits agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in all three aspects should be greatly promoted, grasped tightly and relentlessly, and earnestly done well in various places.

    林粮间作，三全其美
    1958年和1959年，全国每年造林都在二亿亩以上；今年春季，全国各地又营造了大面积的幼林。我们的国家有了这样多的幼林，这是天大的好事。我们一定要精心地把它们抚育好，使之茁壮成长。可是，抚育幼林要用很多劳动力，因此如何在农、林、牧各业之间合理地安排劳动力，作到农、林、牧三全其美，这是一个很重要的问题。解决这些问题的最好的办法，就是林粮间作——在幼林地里种植粮食作物、油料作物、瓜菜和饲料作物。这样，就能以耕作代抚育，让树木和庄稼一齐生长，农、林、牧一齐丰收。这是对劳动力和土地的最合理的综合利用，是高速度发展山区经济的一条正确的道路。
    林粮间作的好处很多。林地种上各种农作物以后，在对农作物进行田间管理的同时，也就进行了林木抚育工作，可以松土保墒，可以使幼林不受杂草欺负。在林地进行耕作，还有利于土壤的改造和熟化；间种作物的根茎叶翻耕后埋到土里，可以增加土壤中的有机质；特别是间作豆类作物，可以利用根瘤菌的固氮作用增加土壤中的含氮量。树木的根系和农作物的根系分布在不同的土层里，能使不同土层中的肥分充分发挥作用。在树木很小的时候，农作物为它们遮荫，使它们少受日灼风袭，还可以减少水分的蒸发。只要按照各自的特性把林木和间作作物配合好，它们都能同时生长得很好。
    林粮间作对幼林的成长十分有利。据调查，在同样土壤、气候条件下，实行间作的林木比没有实行间作的林木，在头十年内，生长速度一般快一倍左右。以创造林木速生丰产先进经验闻名的贵州锦屏县，一向注意林粮间作；这个县的八年成材的杉木林，全是在林粮间作地上培育出来的。安徽金寨县花石公社在杉木幼林里间作粮食，每亩收获二百多斤，而且杉木生长得特别好，高达五尺左右；同年栽的杉木，没有实行间作的，只有一尺多高。实行间作还能使林木早得收益，提高质量。浙江衢县有六千多亩实行间作的油茶树，三年就开花结果；青田县章村公社实行间作的油茶林所产的茶籽，出油率由25％提高到42％。
    不只幼林地可以实行间作，有些成林地实行间作也大有好处。湖南湘西土家族、苗族自治州去年在四十六万亩油桐、油茶林中间作粮食作物，收获了五千九百五十万斤粮食（间作的面积占全州可以间作面积的8％左右，收获的粮食占全州粮食总产量的5％左右）；同时，桐油、茶油也获得空前大丰收。这个州的永顺县首车公社去年实行林粮间作的桐油、茶油增产一倍，收获的杂粮占全社粮食产量的27％。社员们欢乐地歌唱：“上有油，下有粮，幸福生活万年长。”
    林粮间作又是山多田少的地区和草原牧区实现粮食自给的最好的办法。湖南山区有四十九个县原来缺粮，实行林粮间作和其他耕作制度改革以后，去年已经全部实现了粮食自给或自给有余。浙江开化县下湖公社宋村生产队，过去一年缺粮七万多斤；在林地间作粮食以后，现在余粮六万多斤；同时，许多老桐林恢复了青春，油茶籽也增产了一倍多。内蒙古伊克昭盟准格尔旗黑岱沟公社林场，去年实行林粮间作，收入粮食三万多斤、油料三千多斤，薯类一万八千多斤，还生产了许多蔬菜，做到了粮、油、菜自给有余，并且养了猪、羊一百多头。
    不论从哪方面来说，林粮间作都是好事情，值得普遍提倡，值得大干特干。只要林区各级党委和公社领导方面看准这个门道，抓住目前有利时机，下定决心来干，发动群众来干，亲自动手来干，林粮间作一定能干得又多又好。贵州锦屏县今年春天在林地间作的粮食作物已经有五十多万亩。去年这个县在林地间作粮食作物近二十五万亩，平均亩产粮食四百斤；今年仍以亩产四百斤粮食计算，就能从林地拿到二亿斤粮食。锦屏县委充分认识这件事情的巨大的重要性；早在冬季造林的时候，各级党委书记就同群众一起到山上去，领导群众实行带状整地和全面整地造林，深翻了土地，为实行林粮间作创造了有利条件。县委还在速生高额丰产试验林种了林粮间作的试验田，取得经验普遍推广。全县各公社组织了成千成万的林粮间作大军，带上耕牛农具，到山上安营扎寨；从公社党委到生产队党支部，都种了林粮间作丰产试验坡。因此，群众情绪高昂，互相竞赛，要把一大片又一大片的万亩丰产林同时变成粮食丰产山。许多地方的事实都证明了，只要根据以农业为基础的方针做好全面安排，抓紧有利时机，开展群众运动，缺少劳动力等等困难都能克服。在浙江、湖南的很多地方，正是在大搞林粮间作的群众运动中，创造了许多垦复山林和林地田间管理的新技术、新工具，变手工开垦、管理为畜力和新式工具开垦、管理，节约了大量劳动力，实现了大面积的林粮间作。同时，为今后山区、林区实现机械化、半机械化创造了条件。
    凡是办了林场的，林粮间作就作得好；同时，在间作中从粮、油、菜等方面较快地得到了收益，也使林场更加巩固。因此，为了把林粮间作搞好，必须更好地普遍地推行林业“三化”，即林业生产基地化，林业经营林场化，林木培育速生丰产化。在一定的时间内，林业基地也就是粮食基地，林地上的作物管理一般可以由林场的专业队担任。要实现农、林、牧三丰收，必须发扬实事求是的作风，精心地调查研究，掌握各个地区各种林木和各种农作物的生长发育规律，寻求各个季节不同林木和不同农作物的最恰当的间作方式。技术方面的安排要同组织方面的安排密切配合。林地间作的作物大部分是杂粮、豆类、薯类、瓜类、蔬菜等等，这些作物的品种很多，播种时期各不相同，这是调配劳力、安排茬口的好条件，只要精心研究，巧作安排，就能够使有限的人力和地力发挥更大的作用。
    新林地有几亿亩，许多成林中的空地也可以间作，面积是很大的。即使有些林地限于种种条件不宜全部实行间作，以间作一亿五千万亩、亩产粮食一百斤计算，就可以拿到一百五十亿斤粮食。贵州已经实行林粮间作一千五百多万亩；湖南已经
  实行林粮间作一千一百多万亩；其它许多省和自治区也正在大搞林粮间作。各个地区可以间作而还没有间作的林地还多得很，群众开发山地的积极性也大得很。人民公社的进一步巩固和力量的增强，已经给有组织有计划地大规模地开发山地、林区，实行林粮间作创造了极其有利的条件。只要加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，把广大林区群众的积极性引导到林粮间作上去，今年就一定能够得到很大的收获。这种对于农业、林业、牧业三全其美的好事情，各地应该大加提倡，抓紧抓狠，切实作好。
