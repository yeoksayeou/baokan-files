    Cooperate to Protect Key Projects
    Under the unified leadership of the CPC Afang District Committee, the Afang District Planning Commission of Xi'an, the Afang Branch of the Construction Bank, and other relevant departments for capital construction have formed a regular cooperative relationship. In the spirit of "the whole country as a coordinated chess game," they fully tap the potential of materials, transportation, manpower, and technology to fully protect key projects, concentrate forces to fight battles of annihilation, and ensure the completion of many key projects on schedule. While publishing this news on July 30, the Xi'an Daily also published an editorial entitled "Great Cooperation, Protecting Key Projects, Concentrating Forces to Fight Battles of Annihilation."

    协作保重点
    西安市阿房区计划委员会、建设银行阿房支行及其他基本建设有关部门在中共阿房区委的统一领导下，组成了经常性的协作关系。他们根据“全国一盘棋”的精神，充分挖掘物资、运输、人力和技术上的潜力，全力保重点，集中力量打歼灭战，保证了不少重点工程的按期完工。西安日报在7月30日发表这个消息的同时，并发表了题为《大协作、保重点、集中力量打歼灭战》的社论。
