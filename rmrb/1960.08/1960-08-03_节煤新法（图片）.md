New Method of Coal Saving

Zhang Peiren and other workers from the Tianjin No. 1 Leather Factory successfully experimented with mixing 30% to 40% sludge into bituminous coal. After mixing with sludge, the firepower is stronger than burning bituminous coal alone, and the effect is good. After the factory adopted this method, the factory's bituminous coal consumption decreased from 1,800 jin per day to 800 jin. The stoker is adding materials to the furnace.

    节煤新法
    天津第一制革厂的职工张佩仁等，试验在白煤里掺烧30％到40％的污泥成功。掺了污泥以后，火力比单烧白煤更旺，效果良好。这个厂采用这种办法以后，全厂白煤消耗量由过去一天一千八百斤降低到八百斤。这是司炉工正在通炉加料　新华社记者　陈锡珍摄
