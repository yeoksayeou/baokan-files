Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 6th. The Tie Mu Repair and Assembly Plant of the Li Tianmu Commune in Cang County, Hebei Province, adhering to the policy of integrating industry and agriculture, has powerfully supported agricultural production and accelerated agricultural technological transformation. At present, in addition to a small number of workers remaining in the factory to rush to repair and manufacture agricultural machinery and tools, the vast majority of workers have投入了灭荒种菜的斗争 gone into the fight to eliminate wastelands and plant vegetables.

In adhering to the integration of industry and agriculture, this factory actively participates in the formulation of the commune's agricultural development plan.  According to the agricultural development plan and the requirements of intensive cultivation, it formulates internal production plans, listing the commune's industrial production plan as an important part of the agricultural technological transformation plan, so that industrial and agricultural production are closely integrated. They also adopt a method of long-term planning and short-term arrangements. Based on the surplus and deficiency of manpower, animal power, and agricultural tools in each production team, they plan what the factory will produce throughout the year and how much will be produced.  Then, according to the spirit of rushing ahead season by season to get agricultural tools and other farm work done, they arrange production.  They use the less busy agricultural seasons to concentrate their efforts on manufacturing large agricultural tools, so that they can be used without delay during the busy farming season, and free up manpower to directly engage in agricultural production.

The factory's employees have also collectively established 40 mu of "experimental fields" to accelerate agricultural technological transformation, in order to grasp the regularity of agricultural production and combine technological innovation and technological revolution in industrial production with agricultural technological transformation, so as to accelerate agricultural technological transformation in a planned and step-by-step manner.

In order to enable employees to participate in agricultural production in a planned way, the factory, based on the principle of both actively completing the manufacturing and repair of agricultural machinery and tools, and resolving the shortage of agricultural labor as much as possible, has decided on light industrial work during busy farming seasons and busy industrial work during less busy farming seasons, implementing the "2-8", "5-5", and "9-1" systems. This is: during the busy agricultural season, such as the autumn harvest, wheat harvesting, double cropping, and wasteland elimination, the "2-8" system is implemented, that is, 20% of the workforce is retained for industrial work, and 80% of the workforce directly participates in agricultural production. In the event of temporary emergency tasks, this is changed to two days of concentrated industrial production and eight days of agricultural production within ten days. The so-called "5-5" system is that in the medium-busy agricultural season, 50% of the employees are retained for industrial work, and 50% of the workforce helps the production team with field management, or works on the factory's "experimental fields," or spends five days within ten days rushing to manufacture and repair agricultural machinery and tools, and extracts five days to invest in field management. In the less busy agricultural seasons, all efforts are concentrated on rushing to manufacture machinery and tools, and according to the "9-1" system, factory leaders lead technicians to visit each production team every ten days to maintain contact with agricultural production and promptly understand the needs of the peasants.

Since this factory has adhered to the policy of integrating industry and agriculture, the support for agriculture has become increasingly clear, the goals are accurately aligned, and problems are resolved quickly. For example, through in-depth experience on the front line, employees realized the difficulties of labor shortages and backward tools in the production teams. They adopted the method of "four-to-the-team" - cadres, workers, machinery, and technology - to help 29 production teams install 35 power mills, realizing mechanized flour milling, saving 525 laborers and more than 500 livestock to directly invest in agricultural production, and resolving the contradiction between large tasks and labor tensions.

Integrating industry and agriculture has also mobilized the enthusiasm of all employees to participate in and support agricultural production, further strengthened the idea of "taking agriculture as the foundation," with everyone doing good deeds for agriculture and making plans for agriculture in all aspects. In the process of implementing the integration of industry and agriculture, in order to squeeze out time to participate in agricultural production, the workers carried forward the spirit of combining hard work, solid work, and clever work, and vigorously carried out the technological revolution and technological innovation movement. Through self-reliance, they manufactured 12 kinds of machinery such as lathes, rocker drills, screw beds, and electric saws to arm themselves. Therefore, the implementation of the integration of industry and agriculture has not only not affected the completion of industrial production tasks, but also improved production capacity and technical level, and the factory's products have continued to increase. Workers' regular participation in agricultural labor has also further strengthened the relationship between workers and peasants and strengthened the worker-peasant alliance. In the less busy agricultural seasons, each production team also actively sends people and materials to the factory to help the factory rush to produce. The factory also trained 760 technical personnel for each production team through methods such as "inviting in, sending out," and "master teaching apprentices."

    李天木公社围绕农业生产安排社办工业
    农闲大干提前完成工具修配任务  农忙小干大部职工参加农业生产
    新华社天津6日电　河北省沧县李天木公社铁木修配厂，坚持亦工亦农的方针，有力地支援了农业生产，加速了农业技术改造。目前，这个厂除少部分工人留厂赶修赶制农械农具外，绝大部分工人都已投入了灭荒种菜的斗争。
    这个工厂在坚持亦工亦农中，积极参与制订全公社的农业发展规划，根据农业发展规划和精耕细作的要求，制订厂内生产计划，把公社工业生产计划列为农业技术改造规划的一个重要部分，使工、农业生产紧密结合起来。他们还采取长计划短安排的办法，根据各生产队人力、畜力、农具的余缺情况，计划工厂全年生产什么，生产多少；然后根据季季赶前，让农具等农活的精神，安排生产；利用农业小忙季节，集中力量赶制大宗农具，以便在农忙时不误使用，并且腾出人力来直接投入农业生产。
    这个厂的职工还集体建立了四十亩加速农业技术改造的“试验田”，借以掌握农业生产的规律性，把工业生产上的技术革新、技术革命和农业技术改造结合起来，有计划、有步骤地加速农业技术改造。
    这个厂为了使职工有计划地参加农业生产，还本着既积极完成农业机具的制造和修配任务，又尽可能的解决农业劳力不足的原则，决定农业大忙工业小干，农业小忙工业大干，实行了“二八”、“五五”、“九一”制。这就是：在农业大忙季节，如秋收、割麦、双插、灭荒时，实行“二八”制，即留20％的力量搞工业，以80％的力量直接参加农业生产；遇有临时突击任务，则改为在十天内，二天突击工业生产，八天参加农业生产。所谓“五五”制，就是在农业中忙季节，留50％的职工搞工业，用50％的力量帮助生产队进行田间管理，或搞本厂的“试验田”，或在十天内，五天突击制造、修配农械农具，抽出五天来投入田间管理。在农业小忙季节，则集中全力赶制机具，并按照“九一”制，每十天抽出一天由工厂领导干部带领技工到各生产队进行访问，以保持同农业生产的联系，及时了解农民的需要。
    这个厂坚持亦工亦农的方针以来，由于支援农业的底码越来越清楚，目标对得准，问题解决得也快。如职工们通过深入第一线，体验到生产队劳力不足和工具落后的困难，采取干部、工人、机具、技术“四到队”的办法，帮助二十九个生产队安装起三十五台动力磨，实现了磨面机械化，节省出五百二十五名劳力、五百多头牲畜直接投入了农业生产，解决了任务大劳力紧张的矛盾。
    亦工亦农，还调动了全体职工参加和支援农业生产的积极性，进一步坚定了“以农业为基础”的思想，人人为农业办好事、处处为农业做打算。在贯彻亦工亦农的过程中，工人们为了挤出时间去参加农业生产，发扬了苦干、实干、巧干相结合的精神，大搞技术革新技术革命运动，自力更生，自己制造了车床、摇轮钻、螺丝床、电锯等十二种机具，武装了自己。因此，实行亦工亦农，不仅没有影响完成工业生产任务，还提高了生产能力和技术水平，全厂产品不断增加。工人定期参加农业劳动，还进一步密切了工人和农民的关系，加强了工农联盟。各生产队在农业小忙季节，也都主动送人、送料到厂，帮助工厂突击生产。工厂也通过“请上来、派下去”、“以师带徒”等方法，给各生产队培训了技术人材七百六十名。
