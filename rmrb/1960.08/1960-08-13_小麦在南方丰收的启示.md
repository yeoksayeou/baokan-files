The bumper wheat harvest in Shaoyang Prefecture, Hunan Province, this year has shown that, be it in the plains, hills, or mountains, be it in wheat fields, cultivated land, red soil, virgin land, or intercropped with sweet potatoes, a bountiful harvest has been achieved wherever wheat was planted. According to preliminary statistics, the average yield per mu (0.067 hectares) across the prefecture's 850,000 mu of wheat reached 128 jin (64 kg), an increase of 26.2% compared to last year. In Xinglong Brigade, Heitianpu Commune, Shaodong County, a traditionally high-yielding area, the average yield from 349 mu of wheat reached 227 jin per mu. In Lian Yuan's Qixing Commune, nestled among towering mountains, the yield from over 14,700 mu of wheat nearly doubled compared to last year. In Linjia Brigade, Changqiao Commune, Dongkou County, 15 mu of wheat were intercropped on the old Jieling Mountain, over 1,000 meters above sea level and never before cultivated, yielding an average of 150 jin per mu. Most remarkably, the Shaoyang Prefectural Agricultural Science Institute's 463 mu of wheat achieved an average yield of 350 jin per mu. This reveals a truth: wheat yields in the Jiangnan region are no less than those in the North China Plain; the key lies in people's enthusiasm. The greater the enthusiasm, the more meticulous the cultivation, the deeper the potential that is tapped, and the higher the increase in production. In this sense, enthusiasm and increased production are directly proportional.

	"A Bumper harvest does not come easily." The entire process of achieving a bumper wheat harvest encompasses not only the struggle between man and nature, but also the revolution in people's thinking. Although the two are intertwined, the former is predicated on the latter. Regarding people's understanding of wheat, the debate between high yield and low yield, between staple food and miscellaneous grain, not only existed in the past, but also continues to this day. These debates touch on a fundamental question: What status should wheat be given? Clearly, this is not simply a technical issue, but primarily a matter of ideology, as it reflects the struggle between advanced thinking and backward, conservative habits. Our method for resolving this issue is: Guided by the path pointed out by the Party's General Line, adhere to putting politics in command, break superstitions, liberate thinking, and boldly mobilize the masses, with everything undergoing experimentation. In the experiments, we consistently adhered to the "walking on two legs" approach of combining experimental plots by cadres at all levels with large-scale expansion, and combining professional research with the summarization of mass experiences. The scope of the experiments was very broad, including comparative experiments with different varieties, depths, seeding rates, densities, and planting methods (dibbling, row planting), sowing times, and so on. Through the bold creation and practice of the broad masses, the mysteries of nature were deeply revealed, and the science of wheat cultivation in the Shaoyang area was greatly developed. Specific ways to increase production were found, thus gradually transforming small-area experimental plots into high-yielding plots and high-yielding ridges, changing the single-cropping system of wheat to a three-cropping system of sweet potato-wheat intercropping, cotton-wheat, and tea-wheat intercropping. Last year, we also promoted the experience of planting wheat on mountains. In particular, the successful experiments by the Prefectural Agricultural Science Institute on summer sowing and winter harvesting of wheat, as well as two seasons of regenerative continuous harvesting, have opened up new horizons for expanding wheat cultivation. Naturally, the facts of bumper harvests year after year cannot but compel those who viewed wheat differently to gradually abandon their incorrect views and admit defeat in the face of reality. Practice has proven that this process is the process of implementing the Party's General Line, the process of conducting ideological struggle against those whose thinking methods are subjectively one-sided and conservative. It educates people that in the struggle with nature, they should be masters of nature, not slaves. At the same time, this is also a process of enriching and developing the science of wheat. People's understanding of all things is often "discovering the truth through practice, and then confirming and developing the truth through practice" ("On Practice"). Because generally speaking, people's understanding always lags behind practice, and contradictions inevitably arise between the subjective and the objective. The correct method to resolve this contradiction is to dare to practice, because practice will prompt people to gradually approach the truth and grasp the laws of development of things. As Chairman Mao taught us in "On Practice": "Practice, knowledge, again practice, again knowledge, this form repeats itself in endless cycles, and with each cycle the content of practice and knowledge rises to a higher level." Therefore, we say that this year's bumper wheat harvest is a triple harvest of production, ideology, and experience.

	In Hunan, the reason why some people regard wheat as a "miscellaneous grain" and label it as "low-yielding" is mainly because they believe that wheat is a cold-resistant and drought-resistant crop, unsuitable for growth in the South. Because the temperature in the southern region is relatively high, especially during the plum rain season between spring and summer, with abundant rainfall and high humidity, which is not conducive to wheat flowering and grain filling, or to wheat harvesting, but conducive to the growth of diseases and insect pests. Therefore, they hold an attitude of harvesting wheat if there is a harvest, and abandoning it if there is no harvest. This view is extremely unfair. Experience has proven that the reason why wheat yields were low in the past was mainly due to insufficient understanding of the regularities of wheat growth, and old-fashioned and overly extensive cultivation techniques. We know that everything has two aspects, both unfavorable and favorable, and these two aspects can be transformed into each other under certain conditions. From the perspective of our region, although the winter temperature is higher than in North China, it does not hinder wheat growth. On the contrary, it can promote wheat to complete the photophase before winter and enter the differentiation of young spikes. After the spring, wheat elongates rapidly. From elongation to heading, it is the peak growth period of wheat, with large water consumption. Precisely at this time, rainfall increases in our region, which can provide wheat with sufficient moisture and help its growth. Of course, there are relatively more rainy days in the later stage of wheat growth in our region, which will more or less affect the development of the panicle. However, due to sufficient light conditions in the early stage, a large amount of nutrients has been accumulated in the plant, which has already provided a material basis for large panicles and abundant grains. Therefore, as long as the management is good, the impact will not be great. As for the contradiction between the harvest period and the plum rain season, it can be resolved by appropriately advancing the maturity period. According to our investigation, semi-winter wheat such as Zhongda 2509 is suitable for sowing around "Autumn Equinox" and "Cold Dew," while spring wheat such as Nanda 2419 is suitable for sowing around "Cold Dew" and "Frost's Descent." In this way, the favorable natural conditions in the early stage of wheat growth can be fully utilized to overcome the unfavorable factors in the later stage of wheat growth, promote early maturity and early harvest. Even if the plum rain season cannot be completely avoided, sunny and cloudy days can be seized for rushing harvest, and methods such as harvesting, threshing, and drying can be adopted to avoid losses.

	Experience has proven that the potential for increasing wheat production in our region is infinite. In the future, we should focus on expanding the number of spikes, increasing the number of grains, and increasing the grain weight. Currently, the general number of effective spikes has increased from about 70,000 per mu in the early days of liberation to 150,000 to 200,000, as many as 300,000, and as few as 100,000. According to investigations, under the existing conditions, the large-area cultivation level can be increased to 600,000 to 800,000 spikes, and the number of grains per spike should strive for 30-40-50 grains, or even 100 grains. To achieve this, it is necessary to ensure that there are enough main spikes, but relying on the main spikes should not be understood as relying only on the main spikes. To form a high yield, it must include a part of tillering spikes. Especially when the conditions of climate, light, and nutrition are relatively good, wheat will produce polyploidy and multi-branched grains, resulting in compound spikelets, branched spikes, and multiple grains in one husk. The emergence of branched wheat in the Prefectural Agricultural Science Institute just shows that seizing panicle length, panicle size, grain number, and grain plumpness is the direction for high-yield wheat in the Shaoyang area. However, despite the objective possibility of high-yield wheat, turning this possibility into reality still depends on fully utilizing people's subjective initiative and comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Because the "Eight-Character Charter" is a scientific summary of agricultural production experience over the years by Chairman Mao, it correctly summarizes the objective requirements for normal growth and increased production of crops. This requirement does not shift with people's subjective will, whether you recognize it or not, it plays a role. Experience has proven that to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" in wheat production in the Shaoyang area, it is necessary to master reasonable deep plowing, close planting, increased fertilization, and strengthened field management; to ensure full seedlings and strong seedlings, to control the growth and decline of tillers, and to regulate the development of panicle organs. In short, it is necessary to pass the "five passes" (greening-up, jointing, heading, grain filling, harvesting) and do well in the "three attacks" (attacking stems, attacking panicles, attacking grains) and "four defenses" (frost and ice, diseases and insects, lodging, mildew and rot). All these links, although independent, are interconnected. Therefore, in our work, we must give overall arrangements to all measures to prevent paying attention to one thing and losing sight of another. But this does not mean treating them equally, but rather grasping the center and driving the overall situation. What is the center? That depends on the specific time, place, and conditions. For example, Dazhangping Commune in Shaodong County, based on the weakness that most brigades are barren red soil, in addition to grasping the central link of close planting, also engaged in large-scale accumulation of fertilizer and soil improvement. In field management, different main contents are determined according to different periods and different situations. Between "Little Snow" and "Winter Solstice," threatened by winter drought, affecting wheat's greening up and tiller development, a drought resistance and seedling protection campaign was launched. Before winter, the differentiation period of young spikes was also seized to topdress and suppress seedlings to keep them warm for the winter. After the spring, spring rains were continuous, and the wheat fields became hardened, which was not conducive to jointing, so a shock activity of ditching, draining, loosening the soil, and topdressing was carried out. After the Spring Equinox, special attention was paid to pest control, lodging prevention, and elimination of third-class seedlings. To obtain high-yield wheat, in implementing various production increase measures, it is of course necessary to have a center, a focus, and to take into account the overall situation, with one link interlocking with another, and each link tightly interlocked, but for each specific measure, attention must be paid to moderation, and it must not exceed the range allowed by objectivity. Such as close planting, fertilization, deep plowing... From the trend of its development, it is infinite, but within a certain period, it is also constrained by various external conditions. Therefore, it is relative, not absolute, and has a certain limit. We must never, upon hearing that close planting can increase production, plant desperately densely. Or upon hearing that more fertilizer can increase production, apply fertilizer indiscriminately and in large quantities without considering the objective conditions. The result of doing so will inevitably be contrary to our wishes. As the saying goes, "when things reach an extreme, they will reverse," which is the reason. Therefore, to develop wheat production, we must, in accordance with the requirements of the "Eight-Character Charter," conduct scientific experiments creatively and boldly in accordance with local conditions, so as to further understand and master the laws and experience of achieving high-yield and high-yield wheat in the South.

	To concentrate the above experience to one point, it is necessary to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, recognize and master the laws of development of objective things, and give full play to the subjective dynamic role of people. It is necessary to combine daring to think and act with scientific analysis, adopt the working method of the mass line, conduct in-depth investigation and research, and conduct large-scale experimental fields. Conscientiously summarize the production experience of the masses and comprehensively promote it; at the same time, it is also necessary to humbly learn and apply the successful experience of other places. In this way, wheat can achieve large-scale, balanced, and high-yield increases in the South.

    小麦在南方丰收的启示
    中共湖南省邵阳地委第一书记　谢新颍
    今年湖南省邵阳专区的小麦，不论平原、丘陵、高山地区，不论麦田、熟土、红壤土、生荒地或薯麦套种，可以说，但凡种麦处，无处不丰收。据初步统计，全区八十五万亩小麦，平均亩产达一百二十八斤，比去年增产26.2％，原来产量比较高的老产区邵东黑田铺公社兴隆大队，三百四十九亩小麦，平均亩产二百二十七斤。位于崇山峻岭之中的涟沅七星公社，一万四千七百多亩小麦，产量比去年将近翻了一番，洞口长桥公社林家大队在拔海一千米以上、从未种过庄稼的老界山上间作十五亩小麦，平均亩产一百五十斤。最突出的是专区农业科学研究所的四百六十三亩小麦，平均亩产竟达三百五十斤。从这里揭示出一条真理：江南小麦的产量并不亚于华北平原，问题在于人们的干劲；干劲越大，耕作越细，自然潜力挖掘得越深，增产也就越高。从这个意义上来说，干劲与增产是成正比的。
    “丰收来之不易”。夺取小麦丰收的全部过程，不仅包含着人与自然的斗争，而且包含着人们思想上的革命，两者之间虽然是交织进行的，但前者又以后者为前提。从人们对小麦的认识上来看，高产与低产之争，主粮与杂粮之争，不但过去有，就是现在也还继续存在着。这些争论涉及到一个根本问题，就是将小麦究竟处于何等地位？显然，这决不是单纯的技术问题，主要是思想问题，因为它反映了先进思想与落后保守的习惯势力的斗争。我们解决这个问题所采取的方法是：根据党的总路线所指引的道路，坚持政治挂帅，破除迷信，解放思想，放手发动群众，一切经过试验。而在试验中又自始至终坚持了各级干部搞试验田与大面积的扩种相结合，专业研究与总结群众经验相结合的“两条腿走路”方针。试验范围十分广泛，有不同品种、深度、播种量、密度、播种方法（点播、条播）、播种时间等等对比试验。通过广大群众大胆创造和大胆实践，深入地揭开了自然界的奥秘，大大发展了邵阳地区的小麦栽培科学，找到了增产的具体途径，从而逐步将小面积的试验田发展为丰产片、丰产垅，将小麦一熟制改为茹麦套种、棉麦、茶麦间作的三熟制，并在去年还推广了小麦上山的经验。特别是专区农业科学研究所试验成功的小麦夏播冬收和再生连收两季，更为扩种小麦开辟了新天地。自然，一年又一年的丰收事实，也不能不使那些对小麦另眼相看的人，逐渐摒弃自己不正确的看法，而在事实面前认输。实践证明：这个过程，就是贯彻党的总路线的过程，就是对那些思想方法上有主观片面性和保守思想的人们开展思想斗争的过程，它教育人们在与自然作斗争中应当作自然的主人，而不能作奴隶；同时，这也是丰富和发展小麦这门科学的过程。人们对各种事物的认识，往往都是“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理和发展真理”（《实践论》）。因为一般说来，人们的认识总是落后于实践的，主观与客观不免发生矛盾，解决这个矛盾的正确方法，是要勇于实践，因为实践会促使人们一步步接近真理，掌握事物发展的规律。正如毛主席在《实践论》中所教导的：“实践、认识，再实践、再认识，这种形式，循环反复以至无穷，而实践和认识之每一循环的内容，都比较地进到了高一级的程度。”所以，我们说今年小麦的丰收是生产、思想、经验三丰收。
    在湖南，有些人所以把小麦视为“杂粮”并冠以“低产”的帽子，主要认为小麦是耐寒耐旱作物，不适宜在南方生长。因为南方地区气温较高，特别是春夏之交的霉雨季节，雨水多，湿度大，不利于小麦开花结实，不利于小麦收获，却有利于病虫害的滋长。因此，他们对种植小麦抱着有就收、无就丢的态度。这种看法是极不公允的。经验证明：过去小麦之所以低产，主要是人们对小麦生长的规律性认识不足，栽培技术上因循守旧，过于粗放所致。我们知道一切事物都具有两重性，有不利的一面，也有有利的一面，而且这两个方面在一定条件下是可以互相转化的。从我们地区来看，冬季气温虽较华北为高，可是对小麦生长并无妨碍，相反，却能促使小麦在冬前完成光化阶段，进入幼穗分化。开春以后小麦迅速拔节，从拔节到抽穗，正是小麦盛长时期，耗水量大，恰恰在这个时候，我们地区雨量增多，能使小麦得到充沛的水分，有助于它的生长。当然，在我们地区小麦生长后期的阴雨天是比较多的，或多或少要影响穗部的发育，但由于前期光照条件充足，植株内积累了大量的营养素，早已为穗大粒多提供了物质基础，因而只要管理得好，影响也不会大。至于收割期与霉雨季节的矛盾，则只要适当提早成熟期，就可以解决。据我们考察：半冬小麦如中大2509适宜于“秋分”“寒露”边播种，春性小麦如南大2419，以“寒露”“霜降”边为宜，这样，即可充分利用小麦生长前期的有利自然条件，克服小麦生长后期的不利因素，促其早熟早收，即令不能完全躲过霉雨季节，也可以抓住晴天、阴天抢收，采取边收、边打、边晒烘等办法，避免受损失。
    经验证明：我们地区的小麦增产潜力是无穷的，今后应该从扩大穗数，增加粒数和粒重上打主意。当前，一般的有效穗数已由解放初期的每亩七万左右增加到十五万—二十万，多到三十万，少至十万。据调查，在现有条件下，大面积的栽培水平可提高到六十万—八十万穗，每穗粒数应争取三十—四十—五十粒，甚至一百粒。要达到这一点，就得保证有足够的主穗，但依靠主穗不能理解为只靠主穗，组成高产必须包括一部分分蘖穗，特别是在气候、光照、营养诸条件都比较好的情况下，小麦便产生多花性和多支粒性，就产生复小穗、分支穗，和一壳多粒，专区农业科学研究所的分枝小麦的出现，正好说明夺取穗长、穗大、粒多、粒壮，是邵阳地区小麦高产的方向。然而，尽管客观上存在小麦高产的可能性，但要将这种可能性转为现实，还有赖于充分发挥人们的主观能动性，全面地贯彻“八字宪法”。因为“八字宪法”是毛主席对多年来农业生产经验的科学总结，它正确地概括了农作物正常生长和增产的客观要求，这种要求是不以人们的主观意志为转移的，不管你承认也好，不承认也好，它都发生作用。经验证明，邵阳地区在小麦生产中贯彻“八字宪法”，必须掌握合理深耕、密植，增施肥料，加强田间管理；保证全苗壮苗，控制分蘖消长，调剂穗部器官的发育。简单说来，要过好“五关”（返青、拔节、抽穗、灌浆、收割），作好“三攻”（攻秆、攻穗、攻粒）“四防”（霜冰、病虫、倒伏、霉烂）。所有这些环节，虽然是独立的，但又是互相联系的。因此在工作中就必须对各项措施给以通盘安排，防止顾此失彼，但这不是意味着半斤八两地平均对待，而是要抓住中心，带动全面。中心是什么？那就看具体时间、地点、条件而定。如邵东大厂坪公社根据大部分大队是贫瘠的红壤土这个弱点，除了抓住密植这一中心环节外，还大搞积肥和改良土壤。在田间管理上，又根据不同时期、不同情况，确定不同的主要内容。在“小雪”“冬至”间，受冬旱的威胁，影响小麦的返青发蔸，因此，开展了抗旱保苗运动。冬前还抓住幼穗分化期，追肥压芽，以保温过冬。开春后，春雨连绵，麦田板结，不利拔节，于是又开展了开沟、排水、松土、追肥的突击活动。春分后，特别注意除虫害、防倒伏、消灭三类苗。要获得小麦高产，在贯彻各种增产措施中，固然要有中心、有重点，又顾及全面，一环扣一环，环环扣紧，但对每一项具体措施还得注意适度，不能超过客观所允许的范围。如密植、施肥、深耕……。从它发展的趋势来看，是无限的，但在一定时期内又受外界种种条件的约制，因此，它是相对的，不是绝对的，是有一定限度的。我们绝不能一听说密植能增产，就拼命地密，一听说肥料多了能增产，就不顾客观条件，不加选择地乱施肥、多施肥。这样做的结果，必然事与愿违。古语说“物极必反”，就是这个道理。所以，我们发展小麦生产，要依着“八字宪法”的要求，因地制宜，创造性地大胆地进行科学试验，才能进一步认识和掌握小麦在南方达到高额丰产的规律和经验。
    将上述经验集中到一点，就是要高举毛泽东思想红旗，坚持总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝，认识和掌握客观事物的发展规律，充分发挥人的主观能动作用。要把敢想敢干和科学分析结合起来，采取群众路线的工作方法，深入调查研究，大搞试验田。认真总结群众的生产经验，全面推广；同时还要虚心地学习、运用外地的成功经验。这样，就可以使小麦在南方获得大面积的平衡高额增产。
