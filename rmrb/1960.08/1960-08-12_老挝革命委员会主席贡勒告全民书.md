If foreigners try to bribe you with money to disrupt order and undermine the Revolutionary Committee, you must resolutely refuse.
    Lao compatriots! Stand up to defend Laos, to defend freedom, equality, and justice, this is everyone's earnest desire. The Revolutionary Committee will sacrifice its own life for your happiness, the Revolutionary Committee is not seeking any personal gain. We will do everything possible to bring fairness to all Lao compatriots.
    Lao compatriots, stand up! For a long time, we have suffered inhuman oppression. If you do not enjoy freedom and equality in law, then what is the point of your existence? The so-called law must be for all the Lao people, not for a small group of powerful people or any one party. The King has granted the people democratic rights, which are human and inviolable rights. This is a profound desire for human fairness, and at the same time, it conforms to your international spirit.
    Buddhist believers, you must defend Buddhism and not ignore the violation of Buddhism for the sake of money. Your task is to unite to maintain security and order in all provinces and regions. The Revolutionary Committee has protected your freedom rights, and now, everyone must rise up to defend the motherland, religion, the royal court, and the constitution.
    Dear compatriots, let us unite to oppose foreign aggressors who destroy our country and suppress our people.
    Police brothers must actively monitor the situation, prevent foreigners from using money to carry out sabotage activities, and prevent the issuance of counterfeit banknotes aimed at undermining the prestige of the Revolutionary Committee.

                                  Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, Captain Kong Le

    革命委员会高兴地看到同胞们对这一次革命的支持。
    亲爱的同胞们：你们要看到，这一次革命的目的在于给同胞们带来安宁、民族和睦和良好的关系。这一次老挝人民在伞兵第二营指挥官贡勒大尉领导下进行的革命是为了给全体老挝人民带来幸福。这次革命不是由任何外国唆使而进行的。士兵、警察、职员、学生要一起站起来，为你们的自由而斗争。你们不要遗误这个良机，你们要团结起来保卫安宁，互相帮助反对外国通过金钱的势力侵入我国。如果外国人用金钱向你们行贿来破坏秩序，破坏革命委员会，你们要坚决拒绝。
    老挝同胞们！站起来保卫老挝，保卫自由、平等和正义，这是大家的恳切的愿望。革命委员会将为你们的幸福而牺牲自己的生命，革命委员会不是谋求任何个人的利益。我们将尽一切努力给全体老挝同胞带来公平。
    老挝同胞们站起来吧，我们长久以来惨遭无人道的压迫。如果你们没有在法律上享受到自由平等，那末，你们生存是为了什么呢？所谓法律，必须是全体老挝人民的，而不是一小撮有势力人的或者任何一个党派的法律。国王已经赋予人民民主权利，它是人类的、不可侵犯的权利。这是人类的公平的深切的愿望，同时符合你们的国际精神。
    佛教信徒们，你们必须保卫佛教，不要为了金钱而无视佛教受到侵犯。你们的任务是团结起来，以维持各省、各地的安全和秩序。革命委员会已经维护你们的自由权利，现在，大家必须起来保卫祖国、宗教、皇廷和宪法。
    亲爱的同胞们，大家一致起来反对外国侵略者，他们破坏我们的国家，镇压我国的人民。
    警察兄弟们必须积极注视情势，防止外国人利用金钱来进行捣乱活动，防止目的在于破坏革命委员会威信的假纸币的发行。
                                  革命委员会主席　贡勒大尉
