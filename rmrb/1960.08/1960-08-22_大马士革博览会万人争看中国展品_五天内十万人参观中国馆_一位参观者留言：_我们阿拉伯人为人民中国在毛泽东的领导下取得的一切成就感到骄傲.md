Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 20th: The Chinese Pavilion is one of the most attractive and popular pavilions at the current 7th Damascus International Fair. It has only been open for five days, but already 100,000 visitors have toured the pavilion. On the 19th (Friday), which was a Muslim holiday, more than 35,000 people visited the Chinese Pavilion. One visitor wrote in the guestbook, "We Arabs are proud of all the achievements of the People's China under the leadership of Mao Zedong." On the evening of the 17th, after closing time, the lights in the Chinese Pavilion were turned off, but several visitors were reluctant to leave. They lit matches and used the dim light to carefully examine the Chinese-made "Red Flag" brand sedan. The heavy industrial products, people's commune models and photographs, and fine and applied art exhibits in the Chinese Pavilion are surrounded by large crowds every day. Among all the exhibits, the most popular are various machine tools, textile machines, and "Panda" brand radios and tape recorders.

Those Arabs who have always praised the ingenuity of Chinese art and the excellence of light industry and textile products now greatly appreciate the high level of Chinese heavy industrial products. They enthusiastically use terms such as "tremendous progress" and "brilliant achievements" to praise China's development in this area. One visitor wrote in the exhibition's guestbook: "China is undoubtedly a bastion of progress, civilization, and peace." An Arab engineer wrote, "From the exhibition, I have seen the tremendous progress of China in technology, especially in the level of heavy industrial Technology. As an engineer, I am very pleased with all the precision machine tools made in China." Many visitors, including those from Lebanon, Jordan, and other Arab countries, after visiting the Chinese Pavilion, expressed their hope that the Chinese people will achieve greater success in all fields and that the friendship between the Chinese and Arab people will be further strengthened. They wrote in the guestbook with enthusiastic words such as "Ah, Chinese brothers, move forward!" "Long live the People's China!" "Long live the great Chinese people!" "Long live the friendship between China and the Arab world!" and "We Arabs will never forget the great assistance China gave us during the Suez Canal Crisis."

    那些一向称赞中国艺术品别具匠心和轻工业、纺织工业产品优良的阿拉伯人，现在非常欣赏中国重工业的高度水平的产品。他们热情地用“巨大的进步”、“辉煌的成就”等字眼来称赞中国在这方面的发展。一位参观者在展览馆留言簿上写道：“中国无疑是进步、文明及和平的堡垒”。一位阿拉伯工程师写道，“我从展览馆看到了中国在技术方面、特别是重工业技术水平方面的巨大进展，作为一个工程师，中国制造的一切精密工作母机都使我感到非常高兴。”许多观众包括来自黎巴嫩、约旦和其它阿拉伯国家的人，在参观了中国馆以后，表示希望中国人民在各方面取得更大的成就，中国人民和阿拉伯人民之间的友谊进一步加强。他们在留言簿上写下了“啊，中国兄弟们，前进吧！”“人民中国万岁！”“伟大的中国人民万岁！”“中国—阿拉伯的友谊万岁！”和“我们阿拉伯人永远不会忘记中国在塞得港事件时给予我们的伟大援助”等热情洋溢的词句。
