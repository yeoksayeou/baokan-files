Eliminate Pests and Diseases to Seize a Bumper Harvest of Autumn Vegetables
*People's Daily* Commentator

The experience of Tianjin in preventing and controlling the three major diseases of autumn vegetables in 1959, published in our newspaper today, is worthy of everyone's attention. Last year, the 110,000 mu of Chinese cabbage in the suburbs of Tianjin achieved an extraordinary bumper harvest with an average yield of more than 8,000 jin per mu, an increase of 23% compared to the bumper harvest of 1957. This extraordinary bumper harvest was achieved through struggle in the face of a severe epidemic of autumn vegetable diseases. This fact shows that people are by no means powerless in their struggle with nature; it also shows that we must grasp the key and strengthen field management for autumn vegetables.

Virus diseases, soft rot, and downy mildew of Chinese cabbage have always been the main threats to autumn vegetable production. Therefore, the directive on autumn vegetable production issued by the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council on July 19 this year specifically pointed out that the prevention and control of pests and diseases should be listed as one of the main measures to increase the yield per unit area of autumn vegetables. In the past, many places lacked effective prevention and control methods for the three major diseases of Chinese cabbage. For a long time, they could only do some preventive work in cultivation management; once the disease occurred, it became incurable and caused disaster. Taking Tianjin as an example, in 1958, early virus diseases, late downy mildew, and sporadic soft rot throughout the growth period caused a reduction in production of more than 50% due to lack of prevention and control experience. In 1959, under the strong leadership of the Party, the masses were mobilized, and a set of comprehensive measures were summarized and created, which finally effectively overcame the three major diseases and won a bumper harvest. This great achievement and experience of Tianjin is of utmost importance for the bumper harvest of autumn vegetables this year and in the future. This year, in many areas, virus diseases have begun to appear due to abnormal climate. According to weather forecasts, many areas will have more rainfall in September and October, and downy mildew may also become epidemic again. Therefore, the task of overcoming pests and diseases must be put on the agenda of autumn vegetable production this year.

The work of overcoming autumn vegetable pests and diseases, like other work, requires putting politics in command and launching a mass movement. From the time when cabbage production was reduced due to disease in 1958, the leadership of Tianjin clearly pointed out that to win a bumper harvest of cabbage, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party, mobilize the masses, and overcome the three major diseases. As soon as autumn vegetable diseases occurred in 1959, leading cadres went to the front line to mobilize the masses and launched a campaign to eliminate pests and diseases. The 110,000 mu of cabbage were generally sprayed twice in just a few days, which stopped the development of the diseases. The characteristic of Tianjin's pest and disease prevention and control is that it closely grasps the laws and characteristics of the occurrence of autumn vegetable pests and diseases, and does a good job of mass prevention and control. In the initial stage of pest and disease occurrence, professional teams carry out timely prevention and control; in the peak period, because the area of pests and diseases is wide and spreads rapidly, the masses are mobilized to work together and eliminate them at one time. This method of combining regular prevention and control with sudden elimination, and combining professional teams with the broad masses, eliminates the opportunity for pests and diseases to spread and expands the effect of prevention and control.

In the struggle against autumn vegetable pests and diseases, we must fight against all kinds of paralysis and complacency from beginning to end. People often only pay attention to visible pests and ignore the diseases caused by invisible germs. When a small number of lesions are found, they say that they were caused by hoeing, smelly fog, or hot soil, and that they are just a few spots and don't matter. This kind of thinking is harmful to ensuring a stable and bumper harvest. We should adopt the effective methods of Tianjin to clarify and correct these ideas.

There are many kinds of pests and diseases that harm autumn vegetables, and diseases and insects are closely related, so comprehensive prevention and control is necessary to achieve good results. Some pests not only directly harm vegetable seedlings, but also spread diseases. For example, aphids spread virus diseases when seedlings are just emerging; cabbage caterpillars carry soft rot bacteria and bite wounds, opening the door for bacteria to invade. We must make overall arrangements in accordance with the principle of comprehensive prevention and comprehensive elimination, and prevent diseases and control insects at the same time. According to the characteristics that diseases and insects often coexist, Tianjin has created a method of using mixed agents to prevent and control both diseases and insects, which saves medicine, labor, and is highly effective. This is a technical experience worthy of universal promotion.

The situation of autumn vegetable production this year is particularly good, and leaders at all levels attach great importance to it, and all walks of life come to support it. This is a favorable condition for strengthening field management of autumn vegetables, and it should be fully utilized and brought into play. However, the area of autumn vegetables is large this year, there are many new vegetable areas, and the tasks of field management and pest and disease prevention and control have also increased accordingly. The technical and material conditions of new vegetable areas and new vegetable lands are also relatively poor. Therefore, difficulties still exist and must be taken seriously. The most important thing is to strengthen technical guidance and expand the technical team. Tianjin's system of organizing a technical network is a very good system for enabling new vegetable areas to catch up with old vegetable areas, and for old vegetable areas to continue to improve technology, and it can be promoted everywhere.

At present, most of the early-maturing autumn vegetables have been sown, and late-maturing autumn vegetables are being sown. In order to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of autumn vegetables, on the basis of planting enough and planting well, we must also manage them well. One of the important keys to managing autumn vegetables well is to prevent and control pests and diseases. All localities must conscientiously study and apply Tianjin's experience, and grasp the prevention and control of pests and diseases early, tightly, ruthlessly, and thoroughly, master the laws, and strive for the initiative.

    消灭病虫害夺取秋菜大丰收
    本报评论员
    本报今天刊登的天津市1959年防治秋菜三大病害的经验，值得大家注意。去年天津市近郊十一万亩大白菜得到了平均亩产八千多斤的特大丰收，比大丰收的1957年增产23％。这个特大丰收是在秋菜病害严重流行的情况下，通过斗争取得的。这个事实说明，人们在同大自然作斗争中决不是无能为力的；同时也说明对于秋菜必须抓住关键，加强田间管理。
    大白菜的病毒病、软腐病、霜霉病历来就是秋菜生产上的主要威胁。因此，今年7月19日党中央和国务院发出的关于秋季蔬菜生产的指示中特别指出，要把防治病虫害列为提高秋菜单位面积产量的主要措施之一。过去，对于大白菜三大病害，很多地方缺乏有效防治办法。长期以来，只能在栽培管理上作些预防工作；一旦病害发生，就成为不治之症，造成灾害。即以天津市而论，1958年早期病毒病、后期霜霉病和整个生长期间点片发生的软腐病，由于缺乏防治经验，减产在50％以上。1959年，在党的坚强领导下，发动了广大群众，总结和创造了一套综合性的措施，终于有效地战胜了三大病害，夺得了丰收。天津市这一巨大的成就和经验，对今年和今后秋菜丰收来说，具有极其重要的意义。今年不少地区，因气候不正常，病毒病已经开始露头，根据气象预报，九、十月不少地区雨量较多，霜霉病也可能又有流行。因此，必须把战胜病虫害安排到今年秋菜生产日程上。
    战胜秋菜病虫害的工作也和其他工作一样，需要政治挂帅和大搞群众运动。从1958年白菜因病减产时起，天津市领导上就明确指出，要夺取白菜丰收，必须加强党的领导，发动群众，战胜三大病害。1959年秋菜病害一发生，领导干部就亲赴第一线，发动群众，开展了灭虫病战役，十一万亩白菜在短短的几天里普遍打了两遍药，制止了病害的发展。天津市防治病虫害的特点是紧紧掌握住秋菜病虫害发生的规律和特点，作好了群众性的防治工作。在病虫害初发阶段，专业队及时防治；盛发期，由于病虫面积广蔓延快，就发动广大群众，一齐动手，一次歼灭。这种经常防治与突击歼灭、专业队同广大群众相结合的作法，杜绝了病虫蔓延的机会，扩大了防治的效果。
    在与秋菜病虫害作斗争中，自始至终都要与各种麻痹自满思想作斗争。人们往往只重视眼睛看得见的害虫，忽视看不见病菌的病害。少量病斑发现时，说是锄碰的、臭雾潮的、热土烤的，星星点点，没啥关系。这种想法对于稳保丰收是有害的。应当采取天津市行之有效的方法，把这些思想加以澄清和纠正。
    为害秋菜的病虫种类很多，而且病和虫有密切的关系，必须综合防治，才易收效。有些害虫除了直接危害菜苗以外，还传播病害。如蚜虫在幼苗刚出土的时候就传播病毒病；菜青虫等携带软腐病菌，并咬成伤口，为病菌侵害开门。必须根据全面防治、全面消灭的原则，作好全面安排，既防病，又治虫。根据病虫常常同时并存的特点，天津市创造了药剂混合使用、兼治病虫的办法，又省药，又省劳力，效果又高。这是一个值得普遍推广的技术经验。
    今年秋菜生产形势特别好，各级领导都很重视，各行各业都来支援。这是加强秋菜田间管理的有利条件，应该充分利用和发挥。但今年秋菜面积大、新菜区多，田间管理和病虫防治任务也随之加重，新菜区、新菜地的技术和物质条件又较差。因此，困难还是存在的，必须重视。最要紧的是加强技术指导，扩大技术队伍。天津市组织技术网的制度，是使新菜区赶上老菜区，和老菜区继续提高技术的很好的制度，各地都可以推广。
    目前，早熟秋菜大部播完，晚熟秋菜正在播种。为了争取秋菜全面丰收，在种够、种好的基础上，还要再来一个管好。管好秋菜的重要关键之一，就是防治病虫害。各地都要认真研究和应用天津市的经验，对于防治病虫害要抓早、抓紧、抓狠、抓透，掌握规律，争取主动。
