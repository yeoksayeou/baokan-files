Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: Korean Democratic People's Republic Ambassador to China, Li Yong-ho, held a grand reception tonight to celebrate the 15th anniversary of Korea's liberation. Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Chairman Zhu De, and Premier Zhou Enlai all attended the reception.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the reception, extending the warmest congratulations on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government to the heroic Korean people and the government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic.

Premier Zhou said: Today, the Korean Democratic People's Republic has become a socialist country with modern industry and cooperative agriculture, standing vigilantly in the East of the socialist camp, defending peace in Asia and the world.

Premier Zhou said that the path the Korean people have traveled is a path filled with struggle and victory. The history of Korea over the past fifteen years proves that the will of revolutionary people to fight for liberation is indestructible. The struggle and victory of the Korean people have provided valuable experience and set a brilliant example for all people striving for independence, freedom, democracy, and prosperity.

Premier Zhou pointed out that since World War II, the struggle experience of the Korean people and the struggle experience of people from all countries have repeatedly demonstrated that American imperialism has replaced the German, Italian, and Japanese aggressor groups, becoming the most ferocious enemy of people worldwide. Wherever the claws of American imperialism extend, they bring disaster. However, the more evil deeds American imperialism commits, the more it arouses resistance from the people of the world. Many countries in the world controlled and enslaved by American imperialism are, in reality, volcanoes under the feet of American imperialism, and these volcanoes are erupting one after another. However, American imperialism, with its inherent nature of aggression, has not learned a lesson from its series of failures. American imperialism stubbornly adheres to its policy of being an enemy to the people of the world. Recently, American imperialism has been attempting to coerce Latin American countries through the Organization of American States to impose an economic blockade on Cuba, and even carry out military intervention. American imperialism is using the banner of the United Nations to further invade the Congo and is stepping up its plans for co-management and division of the Congo. American imperialism is attempting to use the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to interfere in the Laotian coup. However, no matter what methods American imperialism adopts, its sinister purposes cannot be concealed. No force can stop the Cuban people, the Congolese people, and the Laotian people from achieving their goals, and no force can stop the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the progressive cause of the people of the world from achieving final victory.

Premier Zhou said: The Chinese people resolutely support the Laotian people's struggle to break free from the control and enslavement of American imperialism. The Chinese people resolutely support the struggle of the Congolese people and the people of other African countries against colonialism and for the attainment and maintenance of national independence. The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the heroic Cuban people against American imperialist aggression and for the safeguarding of national sovereignty. The Chinese people are willing to provide the Cuban people, who are fighting for independence and freedom, with all possible assistance without any conditions attached.

Premier Zhou said that the Chinese and Korean governments have made unremitting efforts to ease international tensions, strive for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and defend peace in the Far East and the world. However, American imperialism persists in its war and aggression policies. This further exposes its ugly face of fearing peaceful coexistence and refusing to abandon its policy of war blackmail to the people of the world.

Premier Zhou said that the Chinese and Korean peoples have suffered from and continue to suffer from the aggression of American imperialism. Therefore, they have a deep understanding of the aggressive nature of American imperialism. The peaceful foreign policies of our two governments are unshakable. Our two countries' resolute struggle against American imperialism's war and aggression policies is precisely to defend world peace. We are deeply convinced that as long as the Chinese and Korean peoples, together with the people of socialist countries and the people of the world who love peace, strengthen their unity and persevere in their struggle, the peaceful reunification of Korea will surely be realized, Taiwan will surely be liberated, and peace in the Far East and the world will surely be guaranteed.

Premier Zhou said: Over the past fifteen years, whether in the struggle against American imperialist aggression and for the defense of world peace, or in socialist construction, our two peoples have always supported each other and advanced together. Our friendship is worthy of being called a friendship forged in blood, and worthy of being called a lofty friendship of internationalism. We believe that in the years to come, our two peoples will surely unite even more closely to make greater contributions to strengthening the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and to developing our common cause.

Tonight, Vice-Chairmen Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen, Chen Shutong, and Cheng Qian, Vice-Premiers Li Xiannian, Luo Ruiqing, and Xi Zhongxun, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Li Siguang, Vice-Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong and Fu Zuoyi, Vice-Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Ji Pengfei, former Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers Yang Yong, Political Commissar Wang Ping, and others attended the reception.

The grand reception was held at the Beijing Hotel. Ambassador Li Yong-ho spoke at the beginning of the reception. He said that the history of Korea over the past fifteen years is actually a history of creative labor struggle for building a socialist paradise in the liberated land, and a history of the Korean people's victory in striking at the imperialist aggressors headed by American imperialism.

The ambassador spoke of the unprecedented victories and achievements made by the Korean people in building socialism. He pointed out that we have been able to achieve these achievements because of the policies of our Party -- policies that creatively apply the Marxist-Leninist theory of socialist revolution and socialist construction to the specific practice of our country, and because of the creative struggle of the Korean people who are united as one around the Party like steel. He said that all these victories and achievements of the Korean people in their lofty struggle are inseparable from the fraternal and selfless assistance of the great Soviet people, and the valuable assistance of the Chinese people and the people of other socialist countries.

The ambassador introduced the patriotic struggle of the South Korean people. He said that the South Korean people have further strengthened their confidence through their own struggle: No matter how American imperialism and its lackeys suppress and struggle, as long as the people are awakened, united, and fight, they will be able to win.

The ambassador pointed out that the imperialists, headed by American imperialism, are further shamelessly engaging in conspiracies, attempting to find a way out of the crisis they face through a frenzied arms race and exacerbating international tensions. American imperialism is establishing military bases all over the world against socialist camp countries, continuing to expand its military, reviving West German revanchism and Japanese militarism, and engaging in military conspiracies around the world. The ambassador said that the Korean people have always maintained a high degree of vigilance against these instigations of American imperialism.

The ambassador said that today, the only way to consolidate peace in Korea, clean up the mess in South Korea, and peacefully resolve the Korean issue is to: force the American imperialist aggressor troops to withdraw from South Korea, and let the Koreans themselves resolve the Korean issue through North-South consultation and North-South general elections.

The ambassador said that as long as American imperialism occupies South Korea, the Korean people will not stop their struggle against it and will fight to the end until final victory. The Korean people will never give up until they realize the great revolutionary cause of peacefully unifying the motherland!

Ambassador Li Yong-ho said that in the struggle for the great cause of socialism and peace, the Korean people will further strengthen their unity with the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people of socialist camp countries, unswervingly defend the eastern outpost of peace and socialism, and further strengthen their friendship and unity with the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all peace-loving people of the world.

When praising the friendship between the people of Korea and China, Ambassador Li Yong-ho said that the friendship and solidarity between the people of Korea and China is forged in blood and has been tested and consolidated through arduous struggle and training. The further development of friendly and cooperative relations between Korea and China will further promote the high tide of socialist construction, and will make a significant contribution to the solidarity of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the great cause of peace.

The ambassador finally wished the fraternal Chinese people, who have been continuing their great leap forward along the general line put forward by the Chinese Communist Party, even greater victories.

The speeches of Ambassador Li Yong-ho and Premier Zhou Enlai were warmly welcomed. After their speeches, the band played the national anthems of China and Korea respectively.

Also attending the ambassador's reception were responsible persons from various departments of our national organs, various party groups, and Beijing Municipality, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, people from all walks of life in the capital, as well as diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China. The delegation of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association headed by Kim Jong-heng, the Korean film delegation headed by Kim Han-gyu, and other Korean comrades also attended the reception.

    周总理在朝鲜驻华大使庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年招待会上说
    坚持和平外交政策反对美国侵略政策
    中国人民坚决支持老挝人民刚果人民和古巴人民的正义斗争
    刘主席朱委员长出席招待会　李永镐大使称颂中朝友谊
    新华社15日讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使李永镐今晚举行盛大招待会，庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年。刘少奇主席、朱德委员长和周恩来总理都出席了招待会。
    周恩来总理在招待会上讲话，代表中国人民和中国政府向英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府表示最热烈的祝贺。
    周总理说：今天，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国已经成为一个具有现代化工业和合作化农业的社会主义国家，它正警惕地屹立在社会主义阵营的东方，捍卫着亚洲和世界的和平。
    周总理说，朝鲜人民走过的道路是一条充满着战斗和胜利的道路。朝鲜十五年来的历史证明，革命的人民争取解放的意志是不可摧毁的。朝鲜人民的斗争和胜利，向一切争取独立、自由、民主、繁荣的人民提供了宝贵的经验，树立了光辉的榜样。
    周总理指出，第二次世界大战以后，朝鲜人民的斗争经验和各国人民的斗争经验，都一再说明，美帝国主义已经代替德、意、日侵略集团，成为全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义的魔掌伸到那里，就把灾难带到那里。但是，美帝国主义做的坏事越多，就越激发起世界人民的反抗。世界上许多被美帝国主义控制和奴役的国家，实际上都是美帝国主义脚下的火山，这些火山正在一个接着一个地爆发。但是，侵略成性的美帝国主义并没有从它一系列的失败中接受教训。美帝国主义依然顽固地坚持它与全世界人民为敌的政策。最近美帝国主义正在通过美洲国家组织企图胁迫拉丁美洲国家，对古巴实行经济封锁，甚至进行军事干涉。美帝国主义正在打着联合国的旗号，进一步侵入刚果，并且加紧策划共管和瓜分刚果的阴谋。美帝国主义正在企图利用东南亚条约组织干涉老挝政变。但是，不管美帝国主义采取什么手法，它的罪恶目的都是掩盖不住的。没有任何力量能够阻止古巴人民、刚果人民和老挝人民实现他们的目标，没有任何力量能够阻止亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动和世界人民的进步事业取得最后的胜利。
    周总理说：中国人民坚决支持老挝人民摆脱美帝国主义控制和奴役的斗争。中国人民坚决支持刚果和非洲其他各国人民反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争。中国人民坚决支持英勇的古巴人民反对美帝国主义侵略，维护国家主权的正义斗争。中国人民愿意给为独立自由而斗争的古巴人民一切可能的援助而不附带任何条件。
    周总理说，中朝两国政府为了和缓国际紧张局势，争取不同社会制度的国家之间的和平共处和保卫远东和世界的和平，作出了坚持不懈的努力。美帝国主义却坚持它的战争政策和侵略政策。这就在全世界人民面前进一步暴露了它害怕和平共处、不肯放弃战争讹诈政策的丑恶面貌。
    周总理说，中朝两国人民过去遭受过、至今仍然遭受着美帝国主义的侵略。因此对于美帝国主义的侵略本质有着深刻的认识。我们两国政府的和平外交政策是不可动摇的。我们两国同美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策进行坚决的斗争，也正是为了保卫世界和平。我们深信，只要中朝两国人民同社会主义阵营各国人民一起，同全世界爱好和平的人民一起，加强团结，坚持斗争，朝鲜的和平统一一定能够实现，台湾一定能够得到解放，远东和世界的和平一定能够得到保障。
    周总理说：十五年来，不论是在反对美帝国主义的侵略和保卫世界和平的斗争中，或是在社会主义的建设中，我们两国人民始终是相互支援，共同前进的。我们的友谊称得起是鲜血凝成的友谊，称得起是崇高的国际主义的友谊。我们相信，在未来的岁月里，我们两国人民一定会更亲密地团结起来，为增强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，为发展我们共同的事业，作出更大的贡献。
    今晚，沈钧儒、郭沫若、彭真、陈叔通、程潜副委员长，李先念、罗瑞卿、习仲勋副总理，政协全国委员会副主席李四光，国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义，外交部副部长章汉夫、姬鹏飞，前中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇、政治委员王平等都出席了招待会。
    盛大的招待会在北京饭店举行。李永镐大使在招待会开始时讲话。他说，十五年来的朝鲜历史，实际上就是在解放了的土地上为建设社会主义乐园而进行的创造性劳动斗争的历史，是朝鲜人民打击以美帝国主义为元凶的帝国主义侵略者的胜利的历史。
    大使谈到了朝鲜人民在建设社会主义事业中取得的史无前例的胜利和成就。他指出，我们之所以能够取得这些成就，是因为有我们党的政策——把马克思列宁主义关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的理论创造性地运用于我国具体实践的政策，是因为有钢铁一般团结在党的周围的朝鲜人民的创造性斗争。他说，朝鲜人民在自己崇高的斗争中所取得的这一切胜利和成就，又是同伟大苏联人民兄弟般的无私援助，同中国人民和其它社会主义国家人民的宝贵援助分不开的。
    大使介绍了南朝鲜人民的爱国斗争。他说，南朝鲜人民通过自己的斗争，进一步坚定了这样的信心：不管美帝国主义及其走狗怎样镇压，怎样挣扎，只要人民觉悟起来，团结、斗争，就能够胜利。
    大使指出，以美帝国主义为元凶的帝国主义者们，在进一步无耻地进行阴谋活动，企图从疯狂的军备竞赛和加剧国际紧张局势方面为它所面临的危机寻找出路。美帝国主义在全世界到处建立反对社会主义阵营国家的军事基地，继续扩充军备，复活西德复仇主义和日本军国主义，在世界各地搞军事阴谋。大使说，对于美帝国主义的这些策动，朝鲜人民一向保持高度的警惕。
    大使说，今天，巩固朝鲜的和平、收拾南朝鲜残破局面和和平解决朝鲜问题的途径，只有：迫使美帝国主义侵略军队撤出南朝鲜，由朝鲜人自己通过南北协商和南北普选解决朝鲜问题。
    大使说，只要美帝国主义还霸占着南朝鲜，朝鲜人民就不会停止反对它的斗争，并将战斗到底，直到取得最后胜利。朝鲜人民不实现和平统一祖国这一伟大革命事业，决不罢休！
    李永镐大使说，在为社会主义伟大事业和和平的斗争中，朝鲜人民将进一步加强同伟大苏联、中华人民共和国以及社会主义阵营各国人民的团结，坚定不移地保卫和平与社会主义的东方前哨，进一步加强同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界一切爱好和平人民的友谊与团结。
    李永镐大使在称颂朝中两国人民的友谊时说，朝中两国人民之间的友谊和团结，是用鲜血结成的，并且是通过艰苦的斗争和锻炼而得到考验和巩固的。朝中两国友好合作关系的进一步发展，将会进一步促进社会主义建设的高涨，将会对以苏联为首的伟大社会主义阵营的团结和伟大的和平事业，作出重大的贡献。
    大使最后祝愿一直沿着中国共产党提出的总路线而继续大跃进的兄弟的中国人民，获得更大的胜利。
    李永镐大使和周恩来总理的讲话受到了热烈的欢迎，在他们讲话以后，乐队分别奏中国和朝鲜两国的国歌。
    出席大使招待会的，还有我国国家机关各部门、各党派团体和北京市的负责人，中国人民解放军的高级将领，首都各方面的人士，以及各国驻中国的使节和外交官员。以金钟恒为首的朝中友好协会代表团、以金汉奎为首的朝鲜电影代表团和其他朝鲜同志也出席了招待会。（附图片）
