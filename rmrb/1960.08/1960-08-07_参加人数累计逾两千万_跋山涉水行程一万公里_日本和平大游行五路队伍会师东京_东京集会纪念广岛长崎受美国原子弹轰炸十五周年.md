    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch: A Japanese peace march of 26,000 people grandly converged at Hibiya Park in Tokyo on the evening of the 5th.
    This unprecedented peace march began three months ago. From Hokkaido in the north to Yoron Island near Okinawa in the south, peace marchers set off from all directions toward Tokyo. Ignoring the sweltering heat, they crossed mountains and rivers, passing more than two hundred American and Japanese military bases in Japan, calling on people everywhere to fight for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, opposition to military bases, prohibition of nuclear weapons, realization of disarmament, and maintenance of peace. They were warmly welcomed by people in the cities, towns, and villages they passed. The march traversed ten thousand kilometers across the country, with a cumulative participation of 22 million people along the way.
    After traversing rugged roads, the various routes converged in Tokyo at 10:30 a.m. on the 5th. As the routes entered Tokyo from the east, west, south, north, and southwest, they were warmly welcomed by representatives from the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, France, Chile, and other countries attending the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Total Disarmament. Foreign representatives shouted, "Long live world peace!"
    When the southern route, led by 45-year-old Matsuo Manabe and 24-year-old Hideshige Higa, arrived in Tokyo's commercial center, crowds lining the streets cheered, applauded, and waved to them, while countless colored paper scraps were scattered from rooftops. Among the marchers were Buddhist monks beating drums, and youth waving the flags of the Japan Democratic Youth League and the Socialist Youth League. Each route included groups of middle school students, both male and female.
    Marchers from Hiroshima wore sashes given by atomic bomb victims in Hiroshima. The sashes were inscribed with phrases such as "Demand Peace."
    The marching team from Hakodate carried five thousand paper cranes. Countless ribbons fluttered from their flagpoles, tied by people who joined the march along the way, each ribbon representing a person.
    The marching teams were warmly welcomed as they entered Tokyo on the 5th by representatives attending the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Total Disarmament. Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation, and other members greeted the marching team entering Tokyo from the northwest, and marched together with the marchers.
    American representative Kelly, speaking to the marchers, praised the Japanese people's large-scale struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and for the maintenance of freedom and peace. He emphasized that people of all countries are demanding the formation of a stronger international united front to oppose imperialism and fight for peace and national independence.
    Indonesian representative Matalowaga, welcoming the western route, said that the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance is not only in line with the national interests of Japan, but also in line with the national interests of Indonesia. Therefore, the Indonesian people have held demonstrations in front of the Japanese Embassy in Indonesia to oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance. He called on the Japanese people to unite with the people of other Asian countries to force the United States to withdraw its military bases in Asia.
    Sri Lankan representative Gunawardana, welcoming the southwestern route, said that the Japanese marching teams are like hundreds of rivers flowing into the sea, advancing forever.
    Japanese representative Akira Kazami, addressing the marching teams, called on everyone to unite and resolutely fight against the forces that attack and slander the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: More than two thousand five hundred people held a grand rally at the Tokyo Social Affairs Hall this morning to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States, and swore to strive for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the realization of total disarmament.
    This memorial meeting was jointly hosted by many Japanese Buddhist organizations. It is part of the activities of the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Total Disarmament, which is currently being held in Tokyo.
    Representatives attending the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and sixty foreign representatives, representatives of Japanese atomic bomb victim organizations, atomic bomb victim family organizations, and mass organizations participated in the memorial meeting.
    Yuasa Yasui called on people at the memorial meeting to take concrete action, not only against foreign troops preparing for war, but also against fostering Japanese militarism, and against the Japanese government's policy of hostility towards China, and to strive for disarmament.
    Buddhist leaders such as Junsyo Ota, Chairman of the All Japan Buddhist Association, spoke at the meeting, expressing opposition to wars of aggression and demanding peace.
    Yokoi Kameo, representative of the peace march, said: "We marched together with 22 million people. The people of the world will continue to move forward with the desire for lasting peace."
    After his speech, Zhao Puchu, deputy head of the Chinese delegation, presented Buddhist scriptures on behalf of the Chinese Buddhist community to representatives of the Japanese Buddhist leaders. These Buddhist scriptures were dedicated to the Hiroshima atomic bomb victims' memorial.
    American representative Fritschman said at the meeting that the American people are taking action to prevent their government from launching war.
    Finally, those present offered flowers at the altar set up for the memorial meeting to express their condolences to the Japanese atomic bomb victims.

    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本两万六千人的和平游行队伍在5日晚上浩浩荡荡地到达东京日比谷公园会师。
    这次空前未有的和平大游行是从三个月以前开始的。北自北海道，南从冲绳附近的与论岛，和平游行者从各个地方一齐向东京进发。他们不顾炎热的天气，越过高山和大河，经过二百多个在日本的美国和日本军事基地，呼吁各地人民为废除日美军事同盟条约、反对军事基地、禁止核武器、实现裁减军备和维护和平而斗争。他们受到了路过的都市、城镇和乡村的人们的热烈欢迎。游行队伍在全国跋涉一万公里，沿途累计有二千二百万人参加。
    经过崎岖的道路，各路队伍在5日上午十点半在东京会师。当各路队伍分别从东、西、南、北、西南方向进入东京时，他们受到了正在出席第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的苏联、中国、越南、法国、智利等国代表的热烈欢迎。外国代表们高呼：“世界和平万岁！”
    四十五岁的真锅松夫和二十四岁的比嘉秀次率领的南路队伍到达东京商业中心区的时候，夹道欢迎的人群向他们欢呼、鼓掌和招手致意，同时，从房顶上撒下无数彩色纸片。在游行队伍中有打着鼓的佛教僧侣，有挥舞着日本民主青年同盟和社会主义青年同盟的旗帜的青年。在各路游行队伍中都有成批的男女中学生。
    来自广岛的游行者佩戴着在广岛的原子弹受害者给予的肩带。在肩带上写着要求和平等词句。
    来自函馆的游行队伍拿着五千个纸做的鹤。他们的旗杆上飘着数不清的绸带，这是沿途参加游行的人系上的，每一条绸带代表一个人。

    欢迎西路游行队伍的印度尼西亚代表马塔洛瓦加说，日本人民反对日美军事同盟的斗争不仅符合日本的民族利益，而且也符合印度尼西亚的民族利益。因此，印度尼西亚人民曾经在日本驻印度尼西亚大使馆前面举行了示威，反对日美军事同盟。他要求日本人民同亚洲其他各国人民联合起来迫使美国撤销它在亚洲的军事基地。
    欢迎西南路游行队伍的锡兰代表古纳瓦达纳说，日本的游行队伍像百川流入大海，永远前进。
