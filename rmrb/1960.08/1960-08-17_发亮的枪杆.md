    The Shining Rifle
    Ou Hongqi, Squad Leader of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army
    The old squad leader has been demobilized for almost three years,
    He is fighting on a new front;
    The souvenir the squad leader left me,
    Is only this shining rifle.
    The day the old squad leader left the team,
    He talked to me one last time,
    He said: "In Korea, I used this rifle,
    To thoroughly judge the American robbers!
    It returned to the motherland with me,
    Carrying victory and glory;
    Now, I hand it over to you,
    To build merit for the motherland again."
    When the Korean people joyously celebrate the festival of liberation,
    The singing awakens my memory of my comrades,
    I hold this rifle tightly,
    The old squad leader's words echo in my ears again.
    I offer my blessings to the Korean people,
    And also send my wishes:
    If the American imperialists dare to start fires and hurt people again,
    Whether in China or Korea,
    I will immediately pick up this rifle,
    To realize the old squad leader's message!

    发亮的枪杆
    解放军某部班长　欧洪祺
    老班长复员快三年，
    他战斗在一条新战线；
    班长给我留下的纪念品，
    只有这支发亮了的枪杆。
    老班长离队那天，
    最后一次找我谈话，
    他说：“在朝鲜，就用这支枪，
    把美国强盗彻底地审判！
    它又同我回到了祖国，
    带着胜利和荣光；
    现在，我把它交给你，
    为祖国把功勋再建。”
    当朝鲜人民欢度解放的节日，
    歌声唤起了我对战友的怀念，
    我紧紧地抱住这支枪杆，
    老班长的话又响在耳边。
    我向朝鲜人民祝福，
    还要寄出我的心愿：
    美帝再敢点火伤人，
    不管在中国或朝鲜，
    我将立即拿起这支枪，
    去实现老班长的留言！
