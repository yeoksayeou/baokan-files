    Controlling Cotton Bud and Boll Drop
	Zhang Jichen, Party Committee Secretary of Lao Zhao Zhuang People’s Commune, Linqing City, Shandong Province

    The level of cotton yield is determined by the number and size of the cotton bolls. However, the number of cotton bolls depends on ensuring healthy development of cotton plants, producing more buds, setting more bolls, and making every effort to avoid bud and boll drop, all on the basis of rational close planting. At present, with the number of plants determined, increasing the number of bolls per plant has become an important factor in determining yield.

    In recent years, the number of buds appearing in our commune's cotton fields has been very large, but the rate of bud and boll drop has also been high, generally between 60% and 70%, and in severe cases, even exceeding 80%. Therefore, preventing bud and boll drop and preserving buds and bolls is a crucial key to increasing cotton production. However, the significant importance of this has not been recognized by all cadres and the masses, who believe that bud and boll drop is a natural law and cannot be controlled. Can cotton bud and boll drop be controlled and avoided? According to existing experience, as long as we find the reasons for bud and boll drop, grasp its patterns, and fully exert human subjective initiative, it can and certainly will be effectively controlled. Last year, we preliminarily grasped the patterns of bud and boll drop and took corresponding measures, resulting in an 80% reduction in the bud and boll drop rate in large-area high-yield fields compared to 1958.

    There are two main reasons for cotton bud and boll drop: first, insufficient water and fertilizer, resulting in nutritional imbalance; second, damage caused by insect pests, untimely or unreasonable pruning, poor ventilation and light conditions, water accumulation in cotton fields, and other unfavorable factors such as high temperatures. Therefore, comprehensive measures must be taken to control bud and boll drop. First, topdressing fertilizer should be increased during the bud and flowering period. The amount of fertilizer needed from the budding stage to the full flowering and boll setting stage accounts for 60% to 70% of the total topdressing. During this period, we mastered the principle of more phosphorus and less nitrogen before budding, and equal emphasis on nitrogen and phosphorus after budding. Nitrogen fertilizer was applied in four to five topdressings, while phosphorus fertilizer was applied twice, once after seedling establishment and once before flowering, in conjunction with nitrogen fertilizer. A large application of coarse fertilizer (half a kilogram per plant) was made during the peak budding period, combining organic and inorganic fertilizers, and quick-acting and slow-release fertilizers, so that the cotton's nutrient supply was balanced, avoiding nutrient deficiency and ensuring normal cotton development. Second, water should be applied in a timely manner. When cotton enters the budding and flowering period, the amount of water required increases significantly. During the flowering and budding period, the soil moisture content needs to be between 15% and 18%. Therefore, we made sure to irrigate when water was lacking and hoe when the soil was damp, ensuring the reasonable moisture needed by the cotton seedlings. At the same time, before the rainy season, we must also do a good job of draining water to prevent cotton boll drop caused by damp soil and high temperatures. Third, insect pests should be prevented and controlled in a timely manner. Cotton bollworm damage is one of the main causes of bud and boll drop. During the cotton budding stage, the focus should be on preventing and controlling cotton bollworms, while also controlling cotton aphids. In addition to applying effective pesticides, removing old leaves, removing the terminal buds, and strengthening soil loosening after rain, we should also focus on earthing up the soil, expanding the space at the bottom of the cotton plants to inhibit diseased bolls. Fourth, we must pay close attention to intertillage, earthing up, pruning, and other management practices. Intertillage should be diligent, thorough, deep, and even. Deep intertillage to a depth of twelve to fourteen centimeters should be carried out between rows near the flowering stage to force the root system to grow downwards, so that more of the nutrients during the seedling stage are used underground, and the cotton seedlings can develop in a balanced way, promoting early boll setting and reducing bud and boll drop. After flowering, the root system of the cotton plant is basically fixed, and it needs to absorb a large amount of water and nutrients through the root system. Intertillage can be six to nine centimeters to avoid damaging the lateral roots. The budding period of cotton is also the season when weeds grow vigorously, so it is necessary to constantly earth up the soil and remove weeds to ensure that the cotton field does not become compacted. Reasonable pruning can concentrate the nutrients in the cotton plant, promote early budding and boll setting, improve boll setting rate, and increase boll weight. The timing of topping should be determined according to the growth of the cotton plant, the size of the land force, and the water and fertilizer conditions. Too early topping will cause excessive growth of superfluous buds; too late topping will increase ineffective buds and bolls. In cotton fields with large amounts of fertilizer, topping can be postponed to mid-August. In cotton fields with severe shading, terminal buds and old leaves should be removed in a timely manner to improve ventilation and light conditions.

    With last year's experience, coupled with the establishment of specialized teams this year, strengthened technical management, and favorable conditions such as sufficient water and fertilizer, we will be able to control bud and boll drop to the greatest extent.

    控制蕾铃脱落	山东临清市老赵庄公社党委会书记　张继臣
    棉花产量的高低，决定于棉桃的多少和棉桃的大小。但棉桃的多少，又决定于在合理密植的基础上，保证棉棵健康发育，多现蕾，多结桃，并千方百计避免蕾铃脱落。目前，棵数已定，增加单株结铃数，已成为决定产量的重要因素。
    几年来，我社棉花的现蕾数量是很大的，但是蕾铃脱落率也很高，一般都在60％至70％，严重的竟达80％以上。所以说，防止蕾铃脱落，增蕾保铃是棉花增产的重要关键。但是，这一重大意义还没有被所有的干部群众认识到，他们认为蕾铃脱落是自然规律，是不可控制的。棉花蕾铃的脱落，能不能控制和避免？根据已有的经验，只要找出蕾铃脱落的原因，掌握住它的规律，充分发挥人的主观能动性，就可以而且一定能够有效的加以控制。去年，初步摸到了蕾铃脱落的规律，并相应地采取了措施，结果大面积丰产田的蕾铃脱落率较1958年降低了80％。
    棉花蕾铃脱落的主要原因有二：一是水肥不足，营养供应失调；二是因为虫害的侵袭，整枝不及时、不合理，通风透光条件不好，棉田积水及高温等多方面的不利因素所造成的。因此，控制蕾铃脱落必须采取综合措施。首先，在蕾花期增施追肥。从现蕾到盛花结铃期，需要肥量占总追肥量的60％至70％。在这个时期，我们掌握了现蕾前磷多氮少，现蕾后氮磷并重，氮肥分四至五次追施，磷肥则在定苗后、出花前结合氮肥分两次施下，在现蕾盛期大追一次粗肥（每株一斤），使有机肥料和无机肥料相结合，速效肥与迟效肥相结合，使棉花养分供应平衡，避免了脱肥现象，保证了棉花正常发育。其次，适时浇水。棉花进入现蕾开花期，需要的水分大量增加，开花现蕾时期，土壤需含水率在15％至18％。因此我们作到了缺水就灌，地湿就锄，保证了棉苗所需要的合理水分。同时，在雨季前，还要作好排涝，防止因地湿温高而造成棉铃脱落。第三，及时防治虫害。棉铃虫为害是蕾铃脱落的主要原因之一，在棉花蕾期应以防治棉铃虫为主，兼治棉蚜。具体办法除打有效药剂、打老叶、去边心，加强雨后松土外，还要突出地抓住培土，扩大棉株下部空隙，以抑制病铃。第四，环环抓好中耕、培土、整枝等项管理。中耕要作到勤、透、深、匀。接近开花时行间深耕要达十二至十四厘米，以迫使根群下扎，使苗期的养分用于地下的多，棉苗发育能得到平衡，促使早座桃，减少蕾铃脱落。开花后，棉株的根系已基本定型，需要通过根系吸收大量的水分和养料，中耕可以六至九厘米为宜，以免损伤侧根。棉花的现蕾期也正是杂草盛长之季，必须经常培土除草，保证棉地不板结。合理整枝能使棉株体内养分集中供应，早现蕾铃，提高结铃率，增加铃重。打顶心的时间，应根据棉株的生长情况，和地力大小及水肥条件来决定，过早了会引起赘芽丛生；过晚了会增加无效蕾铃。增肥量大的棉田，打顶心可推到8月中旬。荫蔽严重的棉田要及时打边心、去老叶，改善通风透光条件。
    有了去年的经验，加之今年都固定了专业队，加强了技术管理，有了充足的水肥等有利条件，这就更能够最大限度地控制蕾铃脱落。
