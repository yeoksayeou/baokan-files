On Xinjiang's highway transportation front, thousands upon thousands of workers of all ethnic groups, taking Su Changfu as their role model, are vigorously carrying out a competition to learn from and catch up with the advanced.

Su Changfu is the automobile driving squad leader of the Third Company of the Second Independent Automobile Battalion of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. He is a red banner on China's highway transportation front. For more than eight years, he has overfulfilled his transportation tasks every month and every year, accumulating a total of more than 1.6 million ton-kilometers of freight transported. The ZIS-150 automobile he drives reached a national record last August of 500,000 kilometers of safe and economical driving without major repairs. The major repair expenses he has saved are enough to buy three ZIS-150 automobiles. Last year, he gloriously attended the National Congress of Heroes.

Now, more than half of the 1,600-plus vehicles of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps' Motor Transport Department have safely traveled over 100,000 kilometers, and Su Changfu-style automobile drivers such as Liu Kun, Yang Zhongying, Yang Xiuzhong, and Pan Luxing, who have driven safely for more than 500,000 kilometers, have emerged. Many drivers of the No. 24 Motorcade of the Passenger Transport Company have established ambitious goals in the movement to learn from Su Changfu, and achieved 10,000 ton-kilometers of monthly vehicle-tonnage output in March. By the end of June, they had overfulfilled the first half of the year's transportation plan by 40%, and were rated as an advanced unit in the autonomous region's transportation department for the first half of this year.
