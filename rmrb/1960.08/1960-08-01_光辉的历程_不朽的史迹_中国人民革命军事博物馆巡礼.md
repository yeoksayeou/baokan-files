Glorious Journey, Immortal Historical Sites
——A Visit to the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution
By Our Correspondents Yan Wu, Zhou Zemin, Cheng Peng

On August 1st, the glorious day of the 33rd anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution was solemnly opened. This museum is marked by a huge, radiant "August 1st" military emblem shining in the sky. On both sides of the square in front of the gate, there are two bronze statues reflecting the profound unity between officers and soldiers and the close relationship between the army and the people. Beside the golden gate, snow-white statues of heroes of the army, navy, and air force and militia stand tall, welcoming the visiting crowds.

This museum was built to commemorate the glorious victory of the Chinese People's Revolutionary War and to conduct revolutionary tradition education for the broad masses of people. The approximately 20,000 precious revolutionary historical relics displayed in the museum vividly reflect the glorious course of the Chinese people and their army, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in waging arduous revolutionary struggles against national enemies and class enemies such as imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Third Revolutionary Civil War, the defense of socialist construction, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. They centrally embody the brilliant victory of the correct political line and military thought of our beloved great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, and demonstrate the heroic spirit of the Chinese people in unyieldingly persisting in revolutionary struggle and the moving historical traces of the People's Army advancing triumphantly in the flames of war, overcoming numerous difficulties, and continuously growing and becoming stronger.

　　　　A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire

Stepping into the museum's spacious hall, to the right, at the entrance of the "Second Revolutionary Civil War Hall," a huge screen with purple velvet as a backdrop is inlaid with eight golden and shining characters: "A single spark can start a prairie fire." This is the handwriting of our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong. The hall displays various documents of the Party leading the Chinese revolution from the birth of the Chinese Communist Party, the Nanchang Uprising, the Autumn Harvest Uprising, the Guangzhou Uprising to the period of the 25,000-li Long March, as well as more than 1,800 precious cultural relics such as flags, weapons, equipment, symbols, and utensils used in armed uprisings by people in various regions. It unveils the first page of the heroic epic of the great Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, prominently demonstrating that during this period, mainly relying on the efforts of Comrade Mao Zedong, party cadres deeply recognized the importance of grasping the army to carry out armed struggle, established the Red Army and rural revolutionary bases, and carried out land revolution, thus finding a correct path to revolutionary victory.

The large number of cultural relics displayed here tell us that in the First Revolutionary Civil War, due to Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunist errors, at the critical moment of the revolution, he abandoned the leadership of the revolution. Therefore, when Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution in 1927, the Party and the people could not organize effective resistance, causing the vigorous revolution to fail, and many communists and revolutionary masses were shot and arrested. The blood-stained clothes, relics, and portraits of the communists and revolutionary workers and peasants who were brutally murdered by the counter-revolutionaries at that time deeply move the audience. This is a posthumous letter written by Communist martyr Chen Jue to his wife Zhao Yunxiao in prison. The explanation tells us that Chen Jue was from Hunan and was sent by the Party to study at Sun Yat-sen University in the Soviet Union in 1924. He married Zhao Yunxiao in the Soviet Union. After graduating and returning to China in 1927, the couple went to Hunan to engage in the Party's secret work. In the autumn of 1928, the couple was arrested by the counter-revolutionary Kuomintang. On October 14, Chen Jue was executed in Changsha; five months later, Zhao Yunxiao, who had just given birth a little over a month ago, was also killed by the reactionaries. Just four days before being killed, Chen Jue wrote this posthumous letter: "Yun! Who has no parents? Who has no children? Who has no lover? We are sacrificing everything we have precisely to save the parents, wives, and children of all China. Although we are dead, our unfulfilled will will be accomplished by our comrades who have not died...."

Who can read this posthumous letter without paying solemn respect to the martyrs who shed the last drop of blood for the revolutionary cause? In that stormy era, how many outstanding proletarian revolutionary fighters heroically died under the butcher's knife of the reactionaries! However, the counter-revolutionary massacre made the Chinese people understand the truth that they must also take up knives to deal with counter-revolutionaries who hold knives. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people have not been frightened, conquered, or exterminated. They got up from the ground, wiped the blood from their bodies, buried the bodies of their companions, and they continued to fight." The great Comrade Mao Zedong, in that dark night of wind and rain, issued a firm voice from the helm, calling on the people to rise up and use revolutionary armed forces to eliminate armed counter-revolutionaries. The sound of the "August 1st" uprising cannons at Nanchang and the torch of the Autumn Harvest Uprising personally led by Comrade Mao Zedong led the Chinese revolution into a new period of armed struggle and the creation of the Red Army. The museum displays a spear. Through the red paint on it, you can faintly see the twelve characters: "Long live the success of the revolution," "Long live the peasants' association." Next to it, around the red flag of the "First Division of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army," there are many heroic weapons such as iron rulers, spears, seven-star swords, Guan Gong knives, wolf's tooth clubs, hook-sickle spears, bird guns, and muskets. In September 1927, the awakened peasants, workers, and some of the Northern Expedition soldiers in the eastern part of Hunan and the western part of Jiangxi held these primitive weapons, held high the bright red flag, and followed the great Comrade Mao Zedong, writing a heroic poem that marked an important turning point in the history of the Chinese revolution. Some of the Red Army soldiers of that year, today, stand in front of three extraordinary symbols, their emotions boiling. They are three rectangular symbols made of red coarse cloth, with the words "First Army, First Division, × Regiment of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army" and the names and positions of individuals written on them. These are the symbols worn by officers and soldiers when Comrade Mao Zedong led the Autumn Harvest Uprising troops to Jinggangshan and reorganized the troops in Sanwan, Yongxin County, Jiangxi, and established the First Army and First Division of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army. The Sanwan Reorganization established the absolute leadership of the Party over the army and began to establish Party organizations in the army, laying the organizational foundation for a new type of people's army.

Comrade Mao Zedong led the Red Army to march into Jinggangshan, extensively carried out guerrilla warfare, deeply implemented land revolution, and consolidated the first rural revolutionary base, opening up the only correct new path of development for the Chinese revolution. This path was to shift the center of gravity of the revolution to the countryside, rely on the countryside to establish revolutionary bases, accumulate and develop revolutionary forces, surround the cities from the countryside, and finally seize the cities to achieve national victory. In the museum, five copies of the not-so-large resolution of the Ninth Congress of the Fourth Army of the Chinese Communist Red Army (Gutian Conference), which were copied down that year, attract millions of visitors. This famous resolution "On Correcting Wrong Ideas in the Party" was written by Comrade Mao Zedong based on the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism on establishing a proletarian party and its army, summarizing the experience of the Party's struggle against various wrong ideas in the early days of the Red Army. It stipulated the absolute leadership of the Party over the army, stipulated that the Red Army "is an armed group executing revolutionary political tasks," "is a tool for executing revolutionary tasks," and a series of basic Marxist-Leninist lines and principles for building the army. Around it are displayed many historical relics reflecting the Red Army's leadership in distributing land to peasants in Jinggangshan, persisting in guerrilla warfare, and the unity of the Red Army, the unity of the army and the people, and the unity of officers and soldiers.

The struggle in Jinggangshan pointed out the direction for the Chinese revolution. When the red flag was fluttering on Jinggangshan, from Shaanxi to Hainan Island, from Gansu to Fujian, the red storm swept across more than 300 counties across the country, and the Red Army developed into 13 armies. In the museum, on the huge electric map marking the situation of armed uprisings and revolutionary bases across the country that year, patches of red stars appeared, like a spark falling on the earth covered with dry firewood, rapidly expanding in a prairie fire in ten provinces. Near it, a large number of documents and objects such as battle flags, pictures, announcements, clippings, weapons, utensils, and clothing from armed uprisings in various places, the establishment of various Red Army corps, and the creation of various revolutionary bases are displayed in order. These include the seals and flags of the Workers' and Peasants' Government and the Red Army, the registration form for the people of Ruijin supporting the Red Army in collecting straw sandals, the cap badges and symbols of the Red Army soldiers, the fragments and replicas of the "lychee cannon" made of lychee wood, the land use certificates issued to farmers by the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government, the torch tube used by Fang Zhimin's guerrillas to transmit secret letters, and Liu Zhidan's command flag, broadsword, and pistol. These precious objects are mostly mottled and old, but they truly record the great era characteristics of the early stage of the Chinese revolution and will forever shine with undying sparks.

The world-shaking 25,000-li Long March exhibition hall guides people to follow the Red Army's Long March footprints and experience in a few hours the Red Army crossing the Wujiang River, passing through the Loushan Pass, cleverly crossing the Jinsha River, taking the route through the Yi ethnic region, forcibly crossing the Dadu River, seizing the Luding Bridge, crossing the snowy mountains and grasslands, flying over plank roads, breaking through the dangerous Lazikou, marching on foot across eleven provinces, and the great combat course of the victorious meeting in northern Shaanxi. At that time, due to the "left"-leaning elements holding the leading position of the Party Central Committee, squeezing out Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership, especially Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership of the Red Army, and implementing completely wrong military lines and other wrong policies, the Central Red Army was unable to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's fifth counter-revolutionary encirclement with a million troops, withdrew from the Jiangxi base, and fell into dangerous situations several times at the beginning of the Long March, suffering great losses. By the time it reached Zunyi, Guizhou, the Red Army had decreased from more than 80,000 people to just over 30,000 in just over two months. In the museum, on the huge electric map of the Long March route, a historical city—Zunyi—is clearly marked. It was here that, due to the resolute struggle of Comrade Mao Zedong and other comrades, an enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee was convened, correcting the erroneous military line and other policies at that time, and with the awakening and support of the majority of comrades, Comrade Mao Zedong's leading position in the entire Party was established, saving the Red Army and the revolutionary cause from danger. This was the greatest guarantee for the liberation of the Chinese people and a meeting of decisive significance for the Chinese revolution to turn from danger to safety. From then on, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese revolution have been constantly moving from victory to victory under the leadership of the wise and great leader Comrade Mao Zedong.

Since the Zunyi Conference, under the direct command of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Long March Red Army adopted the policy of mobile warfare, maneuvered and fought, crossed the Chishui River four times, recaptured the Loushan Pass twice, annihilated more than three divisions of the enemy, achieved the first great victory since the Long March, and completely threw the enemy behind. Here, there is a section of rusty iron chain from the Luding Bridge. In the course of the 25,000-li Long March, the Red Army encountered the Dadu River, which was like a natural barrier in front of them. When the enemy issued the arrogant cry that "Now the Communist bandits are equal to the second Shi Dakai. There is the Dadu River in front and the Jinsha River behind. The annihilation of the Communist bandits will be achieved in one fell swoop," 22 assault heroes of the Red Army, holding Mauser pistols, carrying broadswords on their backs, and tying twelve grenades around their waists, led by Company Commander Liao Dazhu, climbed the iron chains of the Luding Bridge, braved the rain of bullets, and flew over the ferocious waves of the Dadu River, opening the way for the Red Army to advance. Here, there is also the brown rope used by the Red Army to forcibly cross the Wujiang River, the iron "foot horses" tied to the feet to prevent slipping when climbing snowy mountains, the brown vest worn when crossing the grassland, specimens of wild vegetables and grass roots eaten by the Red Army to satisfy their hunger during the Long March, and many historical photos and objects from the Long March, vividly showing that the Red Army overcame countless military, political, and natural dangers with amazing perseverance, and finally victoriously met in northern Shaanxi, showing the truth that the flames of the people's revolution can never be extinguished.

　　　　Holding High the Banner of Resistance Against Japan

A large number of cultural relics in the "War of Resistance Against Japan Hall" prove that due to the reactionary Kuomintang government's consistent policy of non-resistance, Japanese imperialism dared to launch a large-scale war of aggression against China at Lugouqiao on July 7, 1937. The iron hooves of the Japanese invaders trampled on the beautiful rivers and mountains of our motherland. Tianjin and Beijing were in danger, North China was in danger, and the Chinese nation had reached its most dangerous moment. Every patriotic Chinese was boiling with enthusiasm, volunteering to go to the front line to kill the enemy. However, the Kuomintang reactionary government still resisted passively, flirting and colluding with the Japanese invaders, spreading the fallacy that "resistance will lead to national demise" today and singing the tune that "continued resistance will lead to national demise" tomorrow. Under the pessimistic mood, hundreds of thousands of Kuomintang troops retreated in defeat, and the Japanese invaders took the opportunity to drive straight in.

At the critical moment of the survival of the Chinese nation, the Chinese Communist Party held high the banner of resistance against Japan and national salvation. Displayed here is the telegram issued by the CPC Central Committee on July 8, 1937—the day after the Lugouqiao Incident—calling on the whole nation to resist Japan, followed by the successive publication of the "Manifesto of the Chinese Communist Party on Resistance Against Japan," the "Ten Major Programs of the Chinese Communist Party for Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation," and Mao Zedong's great works such as "The Policy, Strategy and Prospects of Resisting Japan's Offensive," "On Protracted War," and "On New Democracy." These documents gave the people of the whole country courage, confidence, and ideological weapons to finally defeat the Japanese invaders. The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, carrying the hopes of the nation, vowed to kill the enemy, braving the enemy's artillery fire, and marching day and night to the enemy's rear, advancing to the front line of resistance against Japan. The Eighth Route Army's 115th Division's first battle at Pingxingguan made its name known throughout the world. It hit the Japanese invaders so hard that they were thrown on their backs and their flesh flew everywhere. More than 3,000 members of the Japanese invaders' elite unit, the Itagaki Division, lost their lives under Pingxingguan. This battle greatly boosted the confidence of the people of the whole country in winning the war of resistance. Subsequently, good news of victory in the resistance against Japan came from behind enemy lines. At this time, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army, while fighting the enemy, divided their troops to mobilize the masses and established extensive anti-Japanese base areas in the enemy's rear, strengthening the anti-Japanese forces. The pictures displayed here show that within the Great Wall, north and south of the Yangtze River, and between the Changbai Mountains and the Heilong River, anti-Japanese flames were ignited everywhere; anti-Japanese songs such as "Mother teaches her son to fight the Eastern Ocean, wife sends her husband to the battlefield" were sung everywhere.

After the fall of Wuhan, the War of Resistance Against Japan entered its most difficult years. At this time, a large number of Kuomintang "important officials," generals, and hundreds of thousands of troops, including Wang Jingwei, either directly surrendered to the Japanese invaders or colluded with the puppet regime to attack the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians. Chiang Kai-shek also promulgated the "Measures for Restricting the Activities of Dissident Parties," persecuting anti-Japanese generals and soldiers, and launching three anti-communist high tides in succession. Here are photos of Chiang Kai-shek mobilizing large armies to attack the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region; there is evidence of the Anhui Incident in which Chiang Kai-shek mobilized 80,000 troops to encircle and attack the headquarters of the New Fourth Army. At this time, the Japanese invaders also stopped attacking the Kuomintang army and concentrated their forces to deal with the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, and the New Fourth Army. The burden of the War of Resistance fell on the Communist Party and its army—resisting more than 60% of the total number of Japanese troops invading China and all of the puppet troops. From 1941 to 1942, the Japanese invaders built more than 7,700 bunkers in North China to block and attack the Eighth Route Army, and the total length of the blockade ditches and walls was 11,860 kilometers. Around the Shandong Anti-Japanese Base Area, 2,418 strongholds were set up. In these two years, the Jin-Cha-Ji Eighth Route Army fought the enemy 9,146 times, an average of 13 large and small battles every day. The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army fought the enemy more than 14,600 times in one year alone. In order to destroy the anti-Japanese forces, the Japanese invaders implemented the brutal "Three Alls Policy" in the liberated areas, creating "no-man's land" and "human circles." Countless villages and towns were burned in the fire; the people's food, livestock, and property were looted; collective shooting, burying alive, using people as gun targets, using military dogs to bite anti-Japanese people to death, and other crimes committed by the beastly soldiers were too numerous to mention. Look, these are the white bones of compatriots who were brutally killed by the Japanese invaders that were dug out from the "Ten Thousand People Pit" under Pipa Mountain in southwestern Jinan; this is a young mother who was killed by the Japanese invaders, and her baby is struggling in the pool of blood, crawling on the mother's body to find milk to eat; this is the cruel scene of more than 1,000 young people, women, the elderly, and babies collectively slaughtered by beasts, piled up at the head of Pingyang Village in Fuping County....

The liberated areas were in a severe sandwich between the Japanese invaders, puppet troops, and Kuomintang die-hard troops. The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army resolutely implemented the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong's policy of independently and boldly organizing the people's armed struggle against Japan, further building and consolidating the anti-Japanese base areas, relying closely on the broad anti-Japanese people, overcoming difficulties, persisting in the war of resistance, and launching mass "landmine warfare," "sabotage warfare," "encirclement warfare," "tunnel warfare," "sparrow warfare," and other diverse guerrilla warfare against the enemy. Everywhere was the roar of revenge landmines, and everywhere were angry bullets. The broad masses of militia behind enemy lines cooperated with the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army to fight the enemy so that they could not move an inch and had no place to bury themselves. Look! This is the "tunnel warfare" sand table of Zhao Village in the famous plain area. In an anti-sweeping battle, our army achieved a brilliant victory of killing or wounding more than 200 enemies at the cost of only one light injury. This is the situation of carrying out "sabotage warfare" on the Zhengtai Railway: the rails "turned over," and the enemy's transportation was paralyzed. This is the scene of guerrilla heroes launching "sparrow warfare" in the green gauze tents north and south of the Yangtze River and along the Yellow River: they appeared and disappeared unpredictably, hitting the enemy so hard that they lost their helmets and armor, and their horses were thrown on their backs. Here, there is also the command boat used by the famous Baiyangdian "Yanling Team," the bamboo pole used by veteran Zhao Laoqun to stab a Japanese devil to death, and many local cannons and shotguns that used to make the devils fall into the water at the sound, still majestically standing beside the boat today. The many instruments used by the soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas in the anti-"sweeping," anti-"nibbling," and anti-"clearing" struggles, and the large number of weapons seized from the Japanese invaders, are also here today to explain the moving scenes of how the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines attacked the Japanese invaders.

In the most brutal years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, for the sake of the liberation of the Chinese nation, how many outstanding sons and daughters did the Chinese Communist Party pay the price for! On the beautiful rivers and mountains of our motherland, how many heroic and tragic national heroes who sacrificed their lives for the country appeared! In the "War of Resistance Against Japan Hall," there are relics of many great national heroes, from the porcelain bowl used by martyr Zhao Yiman during her lifetime to General Yang Jingyu's coat and the backpacks, utensils, and belts of the martyrs who sacrificed in the Pingxingguan Victory.... making thousands of viewers feel infinite admiration after seeing them! Please look at the diorama of the Five Heroes of Langya Mountain: the high Langya Mountain, the cliffs soaring into the sky. The heroes stood on the mountain, with enemy corpses lying all over the ground at their feet. After fighting fiercely to the end, the food and ammunition were exhausted. The heroes preferred to die rather than surrender, and jumped off the cliff of ten thousand feet. Here are also the relics of the Fourth Company of a certain unit of the New Fourth Army who heroically sacrificed after annihilating more than 300 Japanese troops in the Battle of Liulaozhuang, and many tragic historical events of the people in the liberated areas who heroically sacrificed to support the troops in resisting the Japanese invaders. They are forever the pride of our great nation.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, hundreds of millions of people, after eight years of arduous struggle, and with the support of the Soviet Red Army and the People's Army of the Mongolian People's Republic, finally broke through the darkness before dawn, defeated the Japanese bandits, and realized Chairman Mao's brilliant prediction: "Persist in resistance, persist in protracted war, persist in the united front, and final victory will surely belong to China." The Japanese invaders surrendered. The command sword of the war criminal—Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in China, Okamura Neji—a large number of collar badges, shoulder badges, and "medals" of Japanese invading army generals and officers, military flags, and bayonets, are piled up here deadly, indicating the shameful end of the invaders, marking the great victory of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan.

　　　From Victory to Victory

The eight-year War of Resistance was finally victorious! The Chinese people eagerly hope to heal the wounds of war, develop production, and build an independent, free, and prosperous new China.

However, stepping into the "Third Revolutionary Civil War Hall," people are angered by the large number of evidences of the US imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries launching a civil war. A series of photos reveal that the US military advisory group is busy training Chiang Kai-shek's army; US planes and warships are hurrying to transport Chiang Kai-shek's American-equipped army to the civil war front lines of Qingdao, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Beiping; at the same time, the US Congress passed the military "aid to China" bill, and by July 1946, loans to aid Chiang Kai-shek in fighting the civil war amounted to 591.4 million US dollars. The US-Chiang reactionaries, on the one hand, attacked the soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas who had bravely resisted Japan, and on the other hand, even declared that Okamura Neji, the chief culprit of the Japanese invasion of China who had his hands stained with the blood of the Chinese people, was innocent. Fifty-eight Kuomintang traitorous generals who had surrendered to the Japanese invaders also held important positions. A large number of puppet troops who recognized the thief as their father actually raised the Kuomintang flag and turned into Chiang Kai-shek's vanguard army to attack the liberated areas. A serious civil war crisis threatened the people of the whole country.

In order to finally save peace and expose the US-Chiang civil war conspiracy, Comrade Mao Zedong personally went to Chongqing on August 28, 1945, to conduct peace talks with Chiang Kai-shek. Here are photos of Comrade Mao Zedong waving goodbye to the people who saw him off at the Yan'an Airport; the scene of various democratic parties and democrats warmly welcoming Comrade Mao Zedong's arrival in Chongqing; the document of the "Summary of the Talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party"—the "Double Tenth Agreement"—signed after twists and turns. However, Chiang Kai-shek completely regarded the agreement as a means to cover up the launching of a civil war. When Comrade Mao Zedong was still in Chongqing, Chiang Kai-shek's secretly issued "Bandit Suppression Manual" was already flying all over the sky, and the sound of cannons attacking the Shanxi Liberated Area also sounded; when Comrade Mao Zedong returned to Yan'an, the "bandit suppression" secret order had been issued to various places. After the US-Chiang reactionaries believed that all preparations for launching a civil war were in place, the Kuomintang openly tore up the "Agreement" and the ceasefire order, openly arrested, massacred, and suppressed the broad masses of people who opposed the civil war and opposed famine. Chiang Kai-shek also personally issued the "National Government" telegram to suppress the student movement. Marshall, the US smiling tiger who acted as the "peace mediator," also took off the mask of "mediator" and rolled back to the United States. The gunfire of the civil war was sounded. The US-made Chiang army planes, artillery, and tanks fiercely attacked the liberated areas. The US aggressor army also personally participated in the attack on the liberated areas. Here is evidence of the US bandits occupying our Kongtong Island in 1945—the Stars and Stripes, bayonets, and various military equipment; photos of US planes and warships attacking Hongshiya in our Jiaodong Liberated Area in 1948 and being repelled by our army, and pictorial records of the confessions of US planes shot down and captured pilots and airmen. How many soldiers and people who had not died at the hands of the Japanese invaders fell into the blood of the civil war....

Abandon illusions, prepare for battle! Under the wise leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the soldiers and civilians of the whole country rose up to defend themselves and launched the glorious historical page of the Great War of Liberation. At the beginning of the war, the enemy had a total strength of 4.3 million, and there were 45 divisions of well-organized American-equipped troops alone, while our army had only 1.2 million. The enemy's army had airplanes, artillery, and tanks, while our army had "millet plus rifles." The enemy was very proud: "Completely annihilate the Communist army in three to six months!" Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly became "President" the day after taking Zhangjiakou. The reactionaries were happy too early, history is ruthless. The CPC Central Committee's "Instructions on Defeating Chiang Kai-shek's Offensive with a War of Self-Defense" and Comrade Mao Zedong's documents on all reactionaries being paper tigers, as well as the pictures of the soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas heroically smashing the Kuomintang military offensive and a large number of spoils of war, made correct historical conclusions.

From the beginning of the War of Liberation, it foretold that our army would win and Chiang's army would be defeated. In the first year of the war, Chiang's army was annihilated by 1.12 million people. These are the photos of the Subei and Lunan campaigns, completely annihilating Chiang's army's 69th Division, 26th Division, and the First Rapid Column. The annihilation of the First Rapid Column proved that no amount of American equipment could save the failure of the reactionary army. Then, in the Battle of Laiwu, seven reorganized brigades of the Kuomintang were annihilated, and Li Xianzhou, the "Deputy Commander" of the "Second Pacification Zone," was also taken prisoner. The inspiring "Menglianggu Campaign" began. Here, viewers can see pictures of the annihilation of the 74th Division, one of Chiang's five main forces. This division was fully American-equipped and was the "Imperial Guard" of Chiang's demon king, the Nanjing Garrison. It underwent special training in the United States, and since it was transferred out of Nanjing as the main force to attack the liberated areas, it had been repeatedly "commended" by Chiang Kai-shek, full of spirit, and arrogant, boasting that "with the 74th Division, there is the Kuomintang" and "with ten 74th Divisions, all of China can be unified." But the bragging was broken. In the Northeast, our army braved the severe cold of minus 40 degrees, "three times south of the Yangtze River, four times protecting Linjiang," and completely smashed the enemy's arrogant plan to seize the Northeast by "attacking the south and defending the north" and "south first and north later." Here, there are also photos of the Dingtao Campaign and the victory in defending Zhangjiakou, and various American weapons seized. Our army's repeated victories on the Northwest battlefield further proved the victory of Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant military thought. The enemy's force attacking the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was as many as 230,000, while our army had only 20,000. However, our army quickly annihilated a large number of enemy troops and smashed Hu Zongnan's key offensive. Next to the battle order to defend Yan'an personally signed by Chairman Mao, are displayed the historical records of the glorious victories of Qinghuabian, Yangmahe, and Panlong.

The achievement of these brilliant victories is the result of the People's Liberation Army correctly implementing the combat policies formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong and the Central Military Commission, and the result of the soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas carrying out the great land reform in accordance with the instructions of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. Look, this is a picture of Comrade Mao Zedong studying the problems of combat and land reform day and night. It is late at night, and he is still concentrating on planning and thinking for the victory of the Chinese people.... Look! This is the scene of the broad masses of peasants happily distributing land. The feudal rule that had been oppressing the peasants for thousands of years was overthrown, and the peasants became the true masters of the land for the first time. Hundreds of millions of peasants went to the front line to defend their victory and support the People's Liberation Army in winning the war.

In the second year of the War of Liberation, our army switched to strategic offensive. From the "Strategic Offensive Schematic Diagram," the audience saw the historical scenes of Liu and Deng's army forcibly crossing the Yellow River and advancing thousands of miles into the Dabie Mountains; and saw our army launching a powerful offensive in the vast areas between East China, Northwest China, North China, Northeast China, and the Yangtze, Huai, Yellow, and Han rivers. Our army was not only able to annihilate the enemy army in divisions and corps during the movement, but also had the indestructible combat ability to capture the ancient capital of Luoyang, Kaifeng, and Jinan. The decisive Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin campaigns began. Among the cultural relics of the brilliant victories of the three major campaigns, the most eye-catching are the instructions personally written by our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong on the three major campaigns. These combat instructions not only show that Comrade Mao Zedong was a genius Marxist-Leninist military theorist, but also a great commander of the People's Liberation Army. On the schematic diagram of the Liaoshen Campaign, which annihilated 470,000 enemies, several red arrows, with the force of overturning mountains and seas, pressed towards a black spot—Jinzhou. After 31 hours of fierce fighting, the defenders were completely annihilated. Then, our army marched eastward, fought a big battle in western Liaoning, captured alive Liao Yaoxiang, the commander of the "Ace Army" Corps of the Kuomintang army, and liberated the entire Northeast. The Huaihai Campaign was carried out completely according to Comrade Mao Zedong's plan. In the beginning, we concentrated our forces to completely annihilate the Huang Botao Corps, isolating the enemy in Xuzhou. Then, the enemy's Huang Wei Corps was annihilated, making the troops led by Du Yuming in Xuzhou a turtle in a jar. Finally, a powerful offensive was launched against the besieged enemy, achieving a great victory that annihilated 550,000 enemies before and after, and shook the world. At the end of 1948, the Pingjin Campaign began. After the liberation of Tianjin and Zhangjiakou, our liberating army took advantage of the victory to directly attack the city of Beiping. The enemy troops defending the city were in a desperate situation with no reinforcements from outside and lack of food and grass inside, and accepted peaceful liberation. Many viewers were attracted by the large string of city gate keys displayed here. These keys to open the gates of Beiping were handed over to us by the enemy defending Beiping at that time.

The war situation took a sharp turn for the worse, and following the guide's baton, people saw the moving scene of the People's Liberation Army's million-strong army approaching the Yangtze River. In order to save its dying fate, the Chiang Kai-shek government in Nanjing suddenly became "benevolent" at this time and came forward to seek peace, saying again and again that it was to "shorten the war time," "reduce the people's suffering," and "save the people as a prerequisite".... The Chinese people deeply knew from many negotiations with the Kuomintang reactionaries that this "peace" demand was a trick, but they still negotiated with the Kuomintang government. However, when the Chinese Communist Party presented the conditions for true peace on behalf of the people of the whole country, the Kuomintang reactionaries once again exposed their faces of "true preparation for war and false peace." Therefore, the People's Liberation Army, in accordance with the orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, began the great Crossing-the-Yangtze Campaign. Look, thousands of cannons raised their heads, and the fiery artillery fire reddened the river and the sky; ten thousand ships were launched together, taking the south bank of the Yangtze River directly. Look, the Chiang Kai-shek government, the last autocratic dynasty in China, sank from history like a broken ship. Here is the heroic scene of the PLA soldiers standing on the roof of the pseudo-presidential palace in Nanjing. The calendar on the desk of the war criminal Chiang Kai-shek, the saber of the pseudo-Acting President Li Zongren, He Yingqin's private seal, and the copper seal of the pseudo-National Government Garrison Brigade have all become the trophies of the people's soldiers and are displayed here.

The People's Liberation Army annihilated 8.07 million enemy troops. Shanghai was liberated, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Chongqing were liberated, Zhoushan and Hainan Island were liberated, and the entire mainland was liberated. Chiang Kai-shek's 20 years of counter-revolutionary rule and the more than 100 years of imperialist rule

    光辉的历程　不朽的史迹
    ——中国人民革命军事博物馆巡礼	本报记者　阎吾　周泽民　程鹏
    在人民解放军建军三十三周年的光荣日子——8月1日，中国人民革命军事博物馆隆重开馆了。这座博物馆，以临空远照、金光灿烂的巨大“八一”军徽作为标志。门前广场两侧，有两座青铜色雕像，反映着人民军队官兵一致和军民一致鱼水相亲的深刻内容。金黄色的大门两旁，雪白的陆海空三军英雄塑像和民兵塑像，英姿勃勃地迎接着参观的人群。
    这座博物馆，是为了纪念中国人民革命战争的辉煌胜利和对广大人民群众进行革命传统教育而兴建的。馆内陈列的两万件左右珍贵的革命历史文物，生动地反映了中国人民及其军队在中国共产党领导下，在第二次国内革命战争、抗日战争、第三次国内革命战争、保卫社会主义建设以及中国人民志愿军在抗美援朝战争等各个历史时期，向帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义等民族敌人和阶级敌人展开艰苦卓绝的革命斗争的光辉历程，集中地体现了我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛泽东同志正确的政治路线和军事思想的辉煌胜利，表现了中国人民不屈不挠坚持革命斗争的英雄气概和人民军队在战火中凯歌行进、克服重重困难、不断成长和壮大的动人史迹。
          星火燎原
    迈进博物馆宽敞的大厅，右侧“第二次国内革命战争馆”入口，紫红色天鹅绒作衬底的巨大屏风上，嵌着八个金光闪耀的大字：“星星之火，可以燎原”。这是我们伟大领袖毛泽东同志的手迹。馆内陈列着从中国共产党的诞生、南昌起义、秋收起义、广州起义到二万五千里长征时期党领导中国革命的各种文献，各地人民武装起义使用的旗帜、武器、红军的装备、符号、用具等各种珍贵文物一千八百多件。揭开了伟大中国人民革命斗争英雄史诗的第一页，突出地表明了：在这期间，主要依靠毛泽东同志的努力，全党干部深刻地认识了掌握军队进行武装斗争的重要性，创建了红军和农村革命根据地，开展了土地革命，从而找到了一条通向革命胜利的正确道路。
    陈列在这里的大批文物告诉我们，在第一次国内革命战争中，由于陈独秀右倾机会主义的错误，在革命紧急关头，放弃了革命领导权，因之当1927年蒋介石叛变革命的时候，党和人民不能组织有效的抵抗，使轰轰烈烈的大革命遭到失败，多少共产党人和革命群众被枪杀和逮捕。这里陈列着的当时被反革命残杀的共产党员和革命工农的血衣、遗物和遗像，深深激动着观众。这是共产党员陈觉烈士在狱中写给他妻子赵云霄的一封遗书。说明告诉我们，陈觉是湖南人，1924年被党派到苏联中山大学留学。在苏联与赵云霄结婚。1927年毕业回国，夫妇相随到湖南从事党的秘密工作。1928年秋，夫妇双双被反革命国民党逮捕。10月14日，陈觉在长沙就义；五个月后，赵云霄刚刚分娩了一个多月，也被反动派杀害了。就在被杀的前四天，陈觉写下了这封遗书：“云！谁无父母？谁无儿女？谁无情人？我们正是为了救助全中国的父母和妻儿，所以牺牲了自己的一切。我们虽然是死了，但我们的遗志自有未死的同志来完成。……”
    谁读着这封遗书能不对那为革命事业流尽最后一滴血的先烈们肃然起敬？在那狂风暴雨的年代，多少优秀的无产阶级革命战士，英勇就义在反动派的屠刀之下啊！但是，反革命的屠杀，使中国人民懂得了对付手里拿着刀子的反革命也必须照样拿起刀来的真理。正如毛泽东同志所说：“中国共产党和中国人民并没有被吓倒，被征服，被杀绝。他们从地上爬起来，揩干净身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸首，他们又继续战斗了。”伟大的毛泽东同志，在那风雨的黑夜，从舵台上发出了坚定的声音，号召人民起来，用革命的武装消灭武装的反革命。南昌城头“八一”起义的炮声和毛泽东同志亲自领导的秋收起义的火炬，把中国革命引向武装斗争、创建红军的新时期。博物馆里陈列着一支梭标，透过上面的斑斑红漆，可以隐约看到：“革命成功万岁”、“农民协会万岁”十二个大字。它的旁边，“中国工农革命军第一师”红旗周围，还有许多铁尺、梭标、七星剑、关公刀、狼牙棒、钩镰枪、鸟枪、火枪等英雄武器。1927年的9月，湖南东部和江西西部一带觉醒了的农民、工人和一部分北伐军士兵，就拿着这些原始武器，高举着鲜艳的红旗，跟着伟大的毛泽东同志，写下了中国革命历史中一个重要转折点的英雄诗篇。一些当年的红军战士，今天站在三种不平凡的符号面前感情沸腾。它们是红色的三块长方形粗布制做的符号，上面写着“工农革命军第一军第一师×团”和人名、职别。这是毛泽东同志率领秋收起义的队伍向井冈山进军途中，在江西永新境内的三湾进行整编，成立工农革命军第一军第一师时官兵们佩戴的符号。三湾改编，确立了党对军队的绝对领导，开始在部队建立党的组织，从组织上奠定了新型的人民军队的基础。
    毛泽东同志率领红军进军井冈山，广泛地开展游击战争，深入地实行土地革命，巩固地创造了第一个农村革命根据地，为中国革命开辟了唯一正确的新的发展道路。这条道路就是把革命重心转移到农村，依靠农村建立革命根据地，积聚和发展革命力量，由农村包围城市，并最后夺取城市而取得全国胜利。博物馆里，当年复写下来的五张篇幅不大的中国共产党红军第四军第九次代表大会（古田会议）决议案，吸引着千百万参观者。这个著名的“关于纠正党内的错误思想”的决议，是毛泽东同志根据马克思列宁主义关于建立无产阶级政党及其军队的基本原理，总结了红军初创时期党和各种错误思想作斗争的经验写成的。它规定了党对军队的绝对领导，规定红军“是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团”，“是执行革命任务的工具”等一系列马克思列宁主义的建军基本路线和原则。在它的周围，陈列着许多反映红军在井冈山领导农民分配土地，坚持游击战争，红军军政一致、军民一致、官兵一致的历史文物。
    井冈山的斗争，为中国革命指出了方向。当井冈山上红旗招展的时候，从陕西到海南岛，从甘肃到福建，红色风暴席卷全国三百多县，红军发展到十三个军。博物馆里，标示当年全国各地武装起义和革命根据地形势的巨大的电动图上，红色星星成片显现出来，真像星星火炬落在布满干柴的大地上，迅速在十个省内以燎原之势向前扩展。在它的附近，顺序陈列着各地武装起义，红军各个军团的成立和各革命根据地的创建的战旗、图片、布告、剪报、武器、用具、衣服等大批文献和实物。其中，包括工农政府和红军的印鉴、旗帜，瑞金人民支援红军募集草鞋登记单，红军战士的帽徽、符号，用荔枝木制成的“荔枝炮”残片和复制品，工农民主政府发给农民的土地使用证，方志敏游击队传送秘密信件的火炬筒，刘志丹的指挥旗、大刀和手枪等等。这些珍贵的物件，大多已斑剥陈旧了，但它却真实地记载了中国革命初期的伟大时代特征，永远闪耀着不灭的火花。
    震惊世界的二万五千里长征陈列厅，引导人们跟着红军长征的足迹，在几个小时内经历了红军过乌江天险，越娄山关要隘，巧渡金沙江，取道彝民区，强渡大渡河，飞夺泸定桥，过雪山草地，飞过栈道，突破天险腊子口，徒步纵横十一省，胜利会师陕北的伟大战斗历程。当时，由于“左”倾分子把持着党中央的领导地位，排挤了毛泽东同志的领导，特别是排挤了毛泽东同志对于红军的领导，实行了完全错误的军事路线和其它错误政策，中央红军没有能够击破蒋介石一百万兵力的第五次反革命围攻，退出了江西根据地，并且在长征的开始，数次陷入危险境地，受到极大的损失。到贵州遵义时，仅两个多月的时间，红军就由八万多人减少成三万多人了。博物馆里，巨大的长征路线电动图上，明显地标出一座历史名城——遵义。就在这里，由于毛泽东同志及其它同志的坚决斗争，召开了党的中央政治局扩大会议，纠正了当时错误的军事路线和其它政策，在多数同志的觉悟和拥护之下，确立了毛泽东同志在全党的领导地位，挽救了处于危险中的红军和革命事业。这是中国人民获得解放的最大保证，是中国革命转危为安有决定意义的一次会议。从此以后，中国共产党和中国革命就一直在英明伟大的领袖毛泽东同志领导之下，不断地由胜利走向胜利。
    自从遵义会议后，长征红军在毛泽东同志直接指挥下，采取运动战的方针，机动作战，四渡赤水，两夺娄山关要隘，歼灭敌军三个多师，取得了长征以来第一次伟大胜利，并且将敌人全部甩在了后面。这里，有一段锈迹斑驳来自泸定桥上的铁索。当年，红军在两万五千里长征途中，遇到天堑一般横在面前的大渡河。当敌人发出“现在共匪等于第二个石达开，前面有大渡河，后面有金沙江，消灭共匪，在此一举”狂妄叫嚣的时候，红军二十二位突击英雄，手持驳壳枪，背挂马刀，腰缠十二颗手榴弹，在廖大珠连长的率领下，攀着泸定桥上的铁索，冒着弹雨，飞越过大渡河凶恶的波涛，为红军打开了前进道路。这里，还有红军强渡乌江天险时用的棕绳，爬雪山时绑在脚上防滑用的铁“脚马子”，过草地时穿的棕背心，长征中红军充饥的野菜、草根标本和许多长征中的历史照片和实物等等，形象地显示了红军以惊人的毅力，战胜了军事上、政治上和自然界的无数艰险，终于胜利会师陕北，显示了人民革命的火焰是永远扑灭不了的真理。
        举起抗日大旗
    “抗日战争馆”里的大批文物证明：由于反动的国民党政府一贯不抵抗政策，使得日本帝国主义敢于在1937年7月7日，在芦沟桥发动了大规模侵华战争。日寇的铁蹄蹂躏着我们祖国的大好山河。平津危急，华北危急，中华民族到了最危险的时候。每个爱国的中国人都热血沸腾，请缨前线杀敌。然而，国民党反动政府仍然消极抗战，和日寇眉来眼去、勾勾搭搭，今天散布“抗战必亡”，明天又唱“再战必亡”的论调。悲观情绪笼罩下的国民党几十万军队，节节败退，日寇乘机长驱直入。
    在中华民族生死存亡关头，中国共产党高高举起抗日救亡的大旗。这里陈列着1937年7月8日——芦沟桥事变的第二天，中共中央发出的号召全民抗战的通电，接着又陆续发表了“中国共产党抗战宣言”、“中国共产党抗日救国十大纲领”和毛主席的“反对日本进攻的方针、办法和前途”、“论持久战”、“新民主主义论”等伟大著作。这些文献给了全国人民以勇气、信心和最后战胜日寇的思想武器。八路军、新四军背负着民族的希望，誓师杀敌，冒着敌人的炮火，日夜兼程向敌后挺进，开赴抗日前线。八路军一一五师首战平型关，威名天下扬。打得日寇人仰马翻，血肉横飞，日寇侵华精锐部队板垣师团三千多人丧命在平型关下。这一仗大大振奋了全国人民抗战胜利的信心。接着，抗日胜利的捷报，从敌后纷纷传来。这时，八路军、新四军和东北抗日联军一面同敌人作战，一面分兵发动群众，在敌人后方建立起广大抗日根据地，壮大抗日力量。陈列这里的图片显示：在长城内外，在大江南北，在白山黑水之间，到处燃起了抗日烽火；到处唱起了“母亲教儿打东洋，妻子送郎上战场”的抗日歌曲。
    武汉失守后，抗日战争开始了最艰苦的年代。这时，包括汪精卫在内的大批国民党“要员”、将领和几十万军队，不是直接投降日寇，就是勾结日伪进攻抗日军民。蒋介石还颁布了“限制异党活动办法”，残害抗日将士，先后发动三次反共高潮。这里有蒋介石调动大军向八路军总司令部和陕甘宁边区进攻的照片；有蒋介石调集八万军队包围袭击新四军军部的皖南事变的罪证。这时，日寇也停止向国民党军进攻，集中兵力来对付共产党、八路军和新四军。抗战的重担落在共产党和它的军队身上——抗击侵华日军总数的60％以上和全部的伪军。从1941到1942年，日寇在华北增修了封锁和进攻八路军的碉堡七千七百多个、封锁沟和封锁墙总长有一万一千八百六十公里。在山东抗日根据地周围，设置二千四百一十八个据点。在这两年中，晋察冀八路军和敌人作战达九千一百四十六次，平均每日大小战斗十三次。八路军、新四军仅在一年中就同敌人共作战一万四千六百多次。日寇为了摧毁抗日力量，对解放区实行了残暴的“三光政策”，制造了“无人区”和“人圈”。无数村镇在烈火中燃烧；人民的粮食、牲畜和财物被抢光；兽兵铁蹄所至，集体枪杀、活埋、拿人做枪靶、用军犬咬死抗日人民等等罪行，罄竹难书。看，这是从济南西南琵琶山下“万人坑”里扒出来的被日寇残杀的同胞的白骨；这是一位被日寇杀死的年轻的母亲，婴儿在血泊中挣扎着爬在母亲尸体上寻找乳吃；这是被野兽们集体屠杀的一千多名青年、妇女、老人和婴儿的尸体，堆集在阜平县平阳村头的残酷景象……。
    解放区处在日寇、伪军和国民党顽固派军队的严重夹击中。共产党和八路军、新四军坚决执行党中央和毛泽东同志关于独立自主地放手组织人民抗日武装斗争的方针，进一步建设和巩固抗日根据地，紧紧依靠广大抗日人民，战胜困难，坚持抗战，对敌人展开群众性的“地雷战”、“破击战”、“围困战”、“地道战”、“麻雀战”等多种多样的游击战，到处是复仇的地雷吼声，到处是愤怒的子弹，敌后广大民兵配合八路军、新四军打得敌人寸步难行，死无葬身之处。看！这是著名的平原地区赵户村的“地道战”沙盘，在一次反扫荡战斗中，我军仅以一人轻伤的代价取得了毙伤二百多敌人的辉煌胜利。这是在正太路开展“破击战”的情形：铁轨“翻身”了，敌军运输瘫痪了。这是大江南北、黄河两岸，青纱帐里，游击健儿展开“麻雀战”的情景：他们忽隐忽现，神出鬼没，打得敌人丢盔弃甲，马仰人翻。这里，还有著名的白洋淀“雁翎队”用过的指挥船，老队员赵老群刺死日本鬼子的竹篙和许多当年打得鬼子闻声落水的土炮和猎枪，今天也仍然威风地雄踞船旁。解放区军民在反“扫荡”、反“蚕食”、反“清乡”斗争中使用的许多器具和缴获日寇的大批武器，今天也在这里说明了当年敌后抗战军民如何打击日寇的动人情景。
    在抗日战争最残酷的岁月里，为着中华民族的解放，中国共产党付出了多少优秀儿女的代价！在我们祖国锦绣山河之上，出现了多少英勇壮烈为国捐躯的民族英雄！“抗日战争馆”里，陈列着许多伟大的民族英雄的遗物，从赵一曼烈士生前使用的瓷碗到杨靖宇将军的外衣和在平型关大捷中牺牲烈士的背包、用具、皮带……。使万千观众看后怀着无限的崇敬！请看狼牙山五壮士的布景箱吧：高高狼牙山，悬崖参天。壮士屹立山上，脚下敌尸遍野。激战到最后，粮弹绝了。壮士们宁死不屈，纵身跳下万丈悬崖。这里还有新四军某部第四连在刘老庄战斗消灭日军三百多人后全部壮烈殉国的文物和许多解放区人民为支援部队抗击日寇而英勇牺牲的壮烈史迹。它们永远是我们伟大民族的骄傲。
    亿万人民在中国共产党领导下，经过八年的艰苦奋战，在苏联红军和蒙古人民共和国人民军的支援下，终于冲破了黎明前的黑暗，打败了日本强盗，实现了毛主席的英明预言：“坚持抗战，坚持持久战，坚持统一战线，最后胜利必然是中国的”。日寇投降了。战犯——侵华日军总司令冈村宁次的指挥刀、大批的日本侵略军将级军官和广大官佐的领章、肩章、“勋章”，军旗和刺刀等，死沉沉地堆集在这里，它表明侵略者的可耻下场，标志着中国人民抗日战争的伟大胜利。
      从胜利到胜利
    八年抗战终于胜利了！中国人民切望医治战争创伤、发展生产，建立独立、自由、富强的新中国。
    但是，迈进“第三次国内革命战争馆”，就被美帝国主义和国民党反动派发动内战的大批罪证所激怒。一幅幅照片揭露：美国军事顾问团在忙着训练蒋介石军队；美国飞机、军舰在匆匆地把美械装备的蒋介石军队运到青岛、天津、秦皇岛、北平等内战前线；在这同时期，美国国会通过了军事“援华”法案，到1946年7月，援助蒋介石打内战的贷款达五十九万一千四百万美元。美蒋反动派一面向英勇抗战的解放区军民大张挞伐，另一面，竟然宣布双手染满屠杀中国人民鲜血的日寇侵华罪魁冈村宁次无罪，民族罪人——投降日寇的五十八名国民党叛国将领也身居要津，大批认贼作父的伪军，居然打起国民党旗，摇身一变，充当蒋介石进攻解放区的先锋军，严重的内战危机威胁着全国人民。
    中国共产党为了最后挽救和平和揭露美蒋内战阴谋，毛泽东同志于1945年8月28日亲赴重庆与蒋介石进行和平谈判。这里有毛泽东同志在延安机场向欢送的人们挥手告别的照片；有各民主党派和民主人士热烈欢迎毛泽东同志到达重庆的情形；有经过曲折斗争后签订了的“国共两党会谈纪要”——“双十协定”的文件。但是，蒋介石完全把协议当做掩饰发动内战的手段，当毛泽东同志还在重庆时，蒋介石密发的“剿匪手册”已经满天飞了，向山西解放区进攻的炮声也响起来了；及至毛泽东同志返回延安，“剿匪”密令已下达到了各地。美蒋反动派认为发动内战一切准备工作就绪后，国民党就公开撕毁了“协定”和停战命令，公开逮捕、屠杀和镇压反内战、反饥饿的广大人民，蒋介石还亲自下达镇压学生运动的“国民政府”代电。做为“和平调处”大员的美国笑面虎马歇尔，也摘下了“调人”的假面具而滚回美国。内战的枪声打响了。美造的蒋军飞机、大炮和坦克，气势凶凶地向解放区杀来。美国侵略军也亲自动手，参加进攻解放区，这里有美国强盗在1945年侵占我崆峒岛时所留下的罪证——星条旗、刺刀和各种军用装具；有1948年美国飞机、军舰向我胶东解放区红石崖进攻而被我军打退的照片，有被我击落的美国飞机和被俘机师、航空员认罪书的图片纪录。多少未曾死在日本侵略者手下的抗战将士和人民，倒在内战的血泊里……。
    丢掉幻想，准备战斗！全国军民在党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，奋起自卫，展开了伟大解放战争的光辉史页。战争开始时，敌人总兵力有四百三十万，光是整编好的美械装备部队就有四十五师，而我军只有一百二十万。敌军是飞机、大炮和坦克，我军是“小米加步枪”。敌人好得意啊：“三个月至六个月全部消灭共军！”蒋介石在拿下张家口的第二天，就急忙忙地当“总统”了。反动派们高兴得过早了，历史是无情的。陈列在馆里的中共中央“关于以自卫战争战胜蒋介石进攻的指示”和毛泽东同志论一切反动派都是纸老虎的文件，以及解放区军民英勇粉碎国民党军事进攻的图片和大批战利品，作出了正确的历史结论。
    解放战争一开始，就预示着我军必胜，蒋军必败。在战争的头一年，蒋军就被歼一百一十二万人。这是宿北、鲁南战役，全歼蒋军六十九师、二十六师和第一快速纵队的照片。第一快速纵队的被歼，证明了任何美械化也救不了反动军队的失败。接着，莱芜一战，国民党七个整旅被歼，“第二绥靖区”中将“副司令”李仙洲也作了俘虏，振奋人心的“孟良崮战役”开始了，观众们在这里可以看到号称蒋军五大主力之一——七十四师被歼的图片。这个师全部美械化，是蒋魔王的“御林军”南京卫戍部队，它经过美国的特种训练，自从调出南京作为进攻解放区的主力后，屡次为蒋介石传令“嘉奖”，神气十足，夜郎自大，自吹“有七十四师就有国民党”、“有十个七十四师就可以统一全中国”。可是牛皮吹破了。在东北，我军冒着零下四十度的严寒，“三下江南，四保临江”，彻底粉碎了敌人“南攻北守”“先南后北”夺东北的狂妄计划。在这里，还有定陶战役和保卫张家口大捷的照片和缴获的各种美式武器。我军在西北战场上的屡战屡胜，更加证明毛泽东同志光辉军事思想的胜利。敌人向陕甘宁边区进攻的兵力有二十三万之众，而我军只有两万人。但是，我军很快歼灭了大量敌军，粉碎了胡宗南的重点进攻。在毛主席亲手签署的保卫延安的战斗命令旁边，陈列着青化砭、羊马河、蟠龙等光辉胜利的史实记载。
    这些辉煌胜利的取得，是人民解放军正确地执行毛泽东同志和中央军委所制定的作战方针，是解放区军民遵照党和毛泽东同志的指示，进行伟大土地改革的结果。看，这是毛泽东同志在日日夜夜研究作战和土改问题的一幅留影。夜已深了，他还全神贯注地为中国人民的胜利而计划着、思考着……。看！这是广大农民分得土地欢天喜地的情形。千百年来压在农民头上的封建统治被推翻了，农民第一次成了土地真正的主人，亿万农民为保卫胜利纷纷走上前线，支援解放军胜利作战。
    解放战争第二年，我军转入了战略进攻。观众从“战略进攻示意图”上，看到刘、邓南征大军强渡黄河、千里跃进大别山的历史镜头；看到我军在华东、西北、华北、东北和江、淮、河、汉之间广大地区展开了强大的攻势。我军不仅能在运动中成师成军地歼灭敌军，而且已具有像攻下古都洛阳、开封以及济南时所表现出那种无坚不摧的作战本领。具有决定性胜利的辽沈、淮海、平津战役开始了。在三大战役辉煌胜利的文物中，最引人注目的是我们伟大领袖毛泽东同志对三大战役亲笔写的指示，从这些作战指示中，不仅说明毛泽东同志是天才的马克思列宁主义的军事理论家，而且也是人民解放军伟大的统帅。歼敌四十七万的辽沈战役的示意图上，数支红色箭头，以排山倒海的气势，向一个黑点——锦州压去，经过三十一个小时的激战，全歼守敌。接着，我军挥师东进，大战辽西，生擒了国民党军“王牌军”兵团司令廖耀湘，解放全东北。淮海战役完全按照毛泽东同志的计划进行。开始，集中兵力全歼黄伯韬兵团，孤立徐州敌人。而后，歼灭了敌人黄维兵团，使徐州杜聿明所率部队成了瓮中之鳖。最后，对被围困的敌人发动了强大攻势，取得前后歼敌五十五万、震动世界的伟大胜利。1948年底，平津战役开始了。在天津、张家口解放后，我解放大军乘胜直捣北平城下，守城敌军陷入外无援兵内缺粮草的绝境，接受了和平解放。许多观众被陈列在这里的大串城门钥匙吸引住了。这些打开北平各城门的钥匙是当时北平守敌交给我们的。
    战局在急转直下，顺着讲解员的指挥棒，看到人民解放军百万雄师兵临长江的动人情形。南京蒋介石政府为了挽救垂死命运，在这时忽然“仁慈”起来，出面求和，口口声声说是为了“缩短战争时间”、“减轻人民痛苦”、“以拯救人民为前提”……。中国人民从多次和国民党反动派谈判中深知这种“和平”要求是一个骗局，但还是和国民党政府进行了谈判。然而，当中国共产党代表全国人民提出真正和平条件时，国民党反动派又一次暴露其“真备战、假和平”的嘴脸。于是，人民解放军遵照毛主席和朱总司令的命令，开始了伟大的渡江战役。你看，千万门大炮仰起头来，炽烈的炮火映红了江面和天空；万船齐放，直取长江南岸。看，中国最后一个专制王朝蒋介石政府，像一只破船一样地从历史上沉没。这里有南京伪总统府楼顶上站上了解放军战士的英武的镜头。战犯蒋介石办公桌上的日历台、伪代总统李宗仁的佩刀、何应钦的私章、伪国民政府警备旅的铜印，都成了人民战士的胜利品陈列在这里。
    人民解放军共歼灭敌军八百零七万。上海解放了，武汉、广州、重庆解放了，舟山、海南岛解放了，整个大陆解放了。蒋介石二十年反革命统治和帝国主义一百多年来对中国统治被推翻了，我们伟大祖国进入了社会主义建设的新时期。
      东方巨人站起来了
      “保卫社会主义建设馆”里，多少人感情沸腾地凝视着开国大典的巨幅照片：天安门前，五星红旗迎风飘扬。天安门上，毛泽东同志在庄严宣告中华人民共和国的诞生。从此，在地球的东方，一个勤劳勇敢的伟大民族，推翻了长期压在身上的帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三座大山，以巨人的姿态站起来了。
    从第一颗革命的火炬在深沉的黑夜里闪耀，到胜利的阳光普照大地；从井冈山第一次举起战斗的红旗，到打败日本强盗，结束由美帝国主义扶植的蒋介石反动王朝的罪恶统治，这是一条人民的胜利的道路。它冲破了帝国主义奴役亚洲人民的锁链。全世界人民最凶恶的死敌美帝国主义不甘心它在中国大陆上的失败，就在新中国刚刚诞生不久，嗥叫着要把新中国“扼死在摇篮里”，“抗美援朝战争馆”里，在美国战争贩子杜勒斯在“三八线”上策划发动侵略战争的罪恶照片，美国总统杜鲁门派兵投入侵朝战争和命令它的第七舰队侵占我国领土台湾的强盗式声明旁边，“美国新闻与世界报道”刊载着一张地图，毫不隐讳地在由朝鲜指向我国沈阳、哈尔滨、北京等地黑色进攻箭头上，标上了空中攻击的航程。
    美国强盗永远也吓不倒经过长期革命战争的伟大中国人民。当着美国强盗疯狂越过“三八线”，扑到鸭绿江边的时候，亿万人一个意志一条心，不怕和美国强盗直接较量。这里，陈列着中国人民志愿军雄赳赳气昂昂过江杀敌的壮丽图片。矗立在这里的“抗美援朝保家卫国”的红色战旗，威风凛凛。引人自豪。这面鲜艳的战旗和志愿军其它许多战旗一起，曾经带着祖国人民的意志，伴随着英雄的志愿军战士，飘扬在冰封的长津湖畔，白雪皑皑的汉江两岸，英雄的上甘岭上，壮丽的临津江边，以后又随同“最可爱的人”凯旋归来。
    “抗美援朝战争馆”里，大量的陈列品都渗透着中朝人民鲜血凝成的战斗友谊，都闪耀着毛泽东同志教导志愿军“爱护朝鲜的一山一水一草一木”的光辉。这里，有舍身从冰窟中救活朝鲜少年崔?的伟大国际主义战士罗盛教烈士的遗像和金日成元帅亲笔用中文写的悼念词：“罗盛教烈士的国际主义精神与朝鲜人民共存。”这里，还有志愿军二级模范吕玉久、张明禄从烈火中舍身救出八位朝鲜妇女的文物。朝鲜人民也用全部身心支援志愿军。用身体掩护志愿军伤员而中弹牺牲的朝鲜国际主义战士朴在根烈士和方元根烈士的遗像和抬担架用的防滑具，朝鲜支前模范具富力抬担架的垫肩和为志愿军伤员洗血衣用的棒棰，也都陈列在这里，具富力，这位“志愿军妈妈”，在战争中被美国炸弹夺去了丈夫，她抬起丈夫使用的担架继续奔驰在前线。这里，一封朝鲜文的信件，就是一首鲜血凝成的伟大国际主义精神的诗篇：1951年5月，志愿军战士谢平，在一次激烈的战斗中负了重伤，被送进朝鲜人民军第七十一医院。当他生命垂危的时候，朝鲜女护士李玉子自动输血救活了他。一个月后，谢平伤愈出院的时候，李玉子胸部被美机炸伤，也是谢平自动输血给了她新的生命。李玉子伤好以后，常为谢平的输血而激动，便给志愿军写了这封被人们誉为“姊弟血”的感谢信。
    中朝人民伟大的国际主义精神和坚强的团结形成了巨大的不可战胜的力量。在三年多的朝鲜战争中，他们用劣势装备战胜了武装到牙齿的凶恶敌人，歼灭敌军一百零九万多人。当记载中国人民志愿军在冰天雪地的云山战场，在零下四十度的长津湖畔，在黄草岭、白云山和飞虎山上，英勇打击侵略者的每一张照片和实物，呈现在观众面前的时候，人们不能不想起那些“一把炒面一把雪”的艰难的也是英雄的岁月。那时，在世界人民最凶恶的敌人面前，中国人民的英雄儿女，几乎只是用步枪和手榴弹，配合朝鲜人民军胜利作战，从鸭绿江边把狂叫要在感恩节前结束朝鲜战争的美国侵略军赶向“三八线”，并且歼灭敌军二十二万。号称美国精锐的骑兵第一师大部被歼，美国“王牌”海军陆战队第一师被打成了重“残废”。被我军歼灭的曾经参加过两次世界大战的美军第七师第三十一团肮脏的团旗也成了志愿军的战利品，在博物馆里，躺在我军英雄连队的奖旗下。
    巡行在上甘岭防御战、金城反击战等著名战役陈列室和黄继光、孙占元等著名英雄遗物和战场实物之间，志愿军高尚的爱国主义、国际主义精神与伟大的英雄形象，使人们万分激动。谁看到这颗上甘岭上被打得千孔百洞的枯树和掺杂着许多弹片的一盒石头粉末不惊讶！它们是上甘岭上经受美国侵略军一百九十多万发炮弹和炸弹之后被志愿军收集起来作为纪念的。志愿军英雄就在这铁雨火海里，昂然守住了上甘岭，激战四十三昼夜，打垮敌人集团冲击九百余次，歼敌二万五千多人。这里，陈列着当时志愿军反击部队插上上甘岭主峰的战斗红旗，旗上有一百三十六个弹孔；陈列着特级英雄黄继光烈士的遗像和浸染着烈士鲜血的一盆泥土和一根敌人机枪射口处的横木，英雄当年火热的胸膛就堵在这个射口上。这里，还有只身冲进敌群，拉响最后一颗手榴弹与敌同归于尽的共产党员孙占元生前用过的机枪；在炮火下让电流通过自己身体保证指挥联络畅通的英雄电话员牛宝才生前使用的电话单机。在一举歼敌十二万三千多人的金城前线夏季反击战役中，人们永远不能忘记伟大战士滕明国等的不朽功勋。在我突击部队向老秃山主峰冲击突然遇到敌铁丝网受阻的紧急情况下，滕明国、吴二华等五位英雄的战士爬伏在铁丝网上，搭成“人桥”，让战友们踏着他们的身体通过，用自己的行为和生命铺平了胜利的道路。英雄滕明国生前写的决心书和使用的冲锋枪现在就陈列在博物馆里。
    “抗美援朝战争馆”里用大量的文物，把美帝国主义从猖獗一时到最后失败的纸老虎原形毕露于观众眼前。三年的朝鲜战争，是第二次世界大战以来，一场最尖锐最大规模的战争与和平、侵略与反侵略的直接较量。在这场较量中，号称资本主义强国、有着海空军优势的头号帝国主义——美国侵略者，使用了除了原子弹以外的各种杀人武器，气焰嚣张到好像要把整个世界一口吞没。然而，英雄的朝中人民部队以坚决的斗争彻底粉碎了美国“不可战胜”的神话。在“抗美援朝战争馆”里陈列着千百件战利品——从美国最新式的飞机、大炮和坦克的残骸，细菌弹的弹壳，到被俘的美军少将迪安和大批美军官兵的供词、悔过书，灰溜溜的美国星条旗以及美军几十个军、师的袖章、臂章和符号等等，活画出了一幅貌似强大的美国纸老虎的丑相。和这些我军的战利品陈列在一起的有美军被中朝人民部队打得低下头来不得不几易统帅梦想挽救失败的报道，还有一本所谓“联合国”军总司令马·韦·克拉克写的哀嚎侵朝战争失败的“从多瑙河到鸭绿江”一书的原文木和译稿。这位被迫在朝鲜停战协定上签字的美国五星将军，在书的开头就无可奈何地承认“……我执行政府的指示，获得了一个不值得羡慕的名望：第一个在没有取得胜利的停战书上签字的美国司令官。”
    “抗美援朝战争馆”里还陈列着大量的美帝国主义破坏朝鲜停战协定，假和平、真备战的种种罪证。朝鲜停战协定的墨迹未干，美国侵略军就乘军用汽车非法越界，向我挑衅。朝鲜停战后，五年间，美方违反停战协定的事件共达七百九十二起，平均每两天多就发生一起。它们向南朝鲜运进了各种新式武器，企图把南朝鲜变为美国发动原子战争的基地。这期间，日夜守卫海防和前沿阵地的朝中战士捕获美国侵略者从非军事区、空中、海上派来进行各种侦察破坏活动的特务也多达七百多人。这些特务使用的各种伪造证件、联络器材、地图和凶器，现在都陈列在这里，无情地揭露美国好战成性的强盗面目，唤起人们对于美国侵略者的高度警惕。
    中国人民革命军事博物馆巨大的规模使参观者忘记了一天的时刻。当你最后从中央大厅兵器馆中各个革命历史时期缴获敌人的各种各样的飞机、大炮、坦克、炮艇中间走出来时，门厅顶部巨大的“八一”军徽已放出闪耀红光。步出大门，东风劲吹，抬头只见繁星满天，你又会情不自禁地要再次回头瞻仰那红光超越一切星星的军徽标志，重温博物馆内的一切，思潮澎湃。军事博物馆记载着人民革命的不朽光荣，也提供了中国人民坚决对付帝国主义和一切反动派的光辉榜样。它将永远成为鼓舞和指导人们，坚决和美帝国主义斗争到底的鲜明战旗和响亮的号角，永远给坚持革命斗争、不断战斗前进的亿万人民以无穷的智慧和力量，千秋万岁，光芒万丈！（附图片）
