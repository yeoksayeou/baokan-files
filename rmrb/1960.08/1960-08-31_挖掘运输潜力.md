    Tap Transportation Potential
    Li Hongbin, Freight Clerk, Shenyang Station
    In the past seven months, our Shenyang Station has victoriously completed its transportation tasks, ensuring that key materials such as coal and steel, as well as materials to support agriculture, were transported in full measure.

    In the new high tide of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, with grain and steel as the center, in order to guarantee the timely supply of materials needed for increased grain and steel production, we must do everything possible to tap transportation potential, using fewer vehicles to complete more transportation tasks. I am determined to achieve the following: First, further strengthen cooperation with highways, enterprises, and factories, organize enterprise loading and unloading labor, and share dedicated line equipment to fully tap human and equipment potential. Second, vigorously organize full truckloads and backhaul transportation to transport more goods with fewer vehicles, using one vehicle as if it were two. Third, strengthen cargo management, tightly grasp the four links of entry, exit, loading, and unloading, assign goods by line, assign people by area, and assign loading and unloading equipment and handling time by cargo type, implement a rapid cycle retrieval method to ensure smooth flow of the freight yard and ensure safety. Fourth, continue to carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, thoroughly renovate outdated transportation equipment, and implement streamlined transportation.

    挖掘运输潜力
    沈阳车站货运员　李鸿滨
    过去七个多月，我们沈阳站胜利地完成了运输任务，做到了煤、钢等重点物资和支援农业物资的运输斤两不少。
    在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动新高潮中，为了保证粮、钢增产所需物资得到及时供应，必须千方百计挖掘运输潜力，以较少的车辆完成更多的运输任务。我决心要做到下面几点：一、进一步加强与公路、企业、工厂协作，组织企业装卸劳力、专用线设备共用，充分挖掘人力、设备潜力。二、大力组织货车满载和捎脚运输，做到以少数车辆运输较多的货物，一车顶两车使用。三、加强货物管理，紧紧抓住进、出、装、卸四个环节，按线定货，按区定人、按货定装卸机具和搬运时间，实行快速循环取车方法，使货场畅通无阻，确保安全。四、继续开展技术革新和技术革命运动，对陈旧运输设备进行彻底改造，实行一条龙运输。
