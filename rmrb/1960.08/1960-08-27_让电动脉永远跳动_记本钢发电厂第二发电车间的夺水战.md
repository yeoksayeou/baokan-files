    Let the Electric Pulse Beat Forever
    —An Account of the Water-Seizing Battle in the Second Power Workshop of Benxi Iron and Steel Power Plant
    Collective Writing by Xinhua News Agency, Liaoning Daily, and Benxi Daily Reporters
    Just as the extraordinary flood was seriously threatening Benxi City, a heart-stirring and intense battle to seize every drop of water was being waged in a small factory workshop on the banks of the Taizi River – the Second Power Workshop of the Benxi Iron and Steel Power Plant. Under the leadership of the Party, the workers twisted themselves into a single rope, relying on the support of the people of the city, and finally preserved the workshop and maintained production.
    The Taizi River flows endlessly, and this heroic song of triumph will be sung by the people forever.
          A Common Oath
    The incident occurred after the rainstorm on August 4th, when the water of the Taizi River rose more than ten meters, greatly exceeding the warning level. In a short time, the flood submerged the first water source, and then the second water source was also submerged, cutting off all water supply to the power workshop. The water stored in the power workshop's water tower could only maintain the generator for half a day at most. To restore the water source would definitely take more than a day. Even more unfortunately, news came that a powerful transmission line connecting the workshop to the power grid had also been washed away by the flood.
    However, the power could not be stopped. If this workshop shut down, the transportation of the Caitun vertical shaft would immediately be cut off, the underground pumps would immediately stop draining water, and the groundwater would immediately flood the mine. And Anshan Iron and Steel, which relied on Caitun Mine for coking coal, would have its production greatly affected. The power workshop was faced with a serious task. An emergency enlarged meeting of the Party branch committee was held in the branch office. All the Party branch committee members, workshop directors, and engineers, who had all been promoted from the ranks of workers, had one common answer: "For the sake of Caitun Coal Mine, for the sake of Anshan Iron and Steel, we must not stop the power."
    Without water, how could we generate electricity? With the whole Party united in one heart, a solution emerged. They jointly discussed the following three measures: First, mobilize the masses to offer suggestions and find water sources everywhere; second, intercept mountain water into the pool to provide emergency relief; and third, conserve water, and not allow anyone to waste a single drop.
    After the branch meeting, the intense water-grabbing battle began. Party Branch Secretary Zhao Chunde, Deputy Secretaries Wu Zhiyi, and Wang Quancai all set out, followed closely by workers Sun Longfei, Sun Zhenwen, Wang Bingchu, and Communist Party member and veteran worker Liu Jiafeng, who had just rushed to the factory from home. They came to the back mountain and saw mountain torrents pouring down like waterfalls and springs. They immediately thought of a way to build two mud walls on the open ditches on both sides of the water tower to divert the water to the water tower. However, the huge water tower was like a bottomless pit, and a drop in the bucket could not solve the problem.
    The water level in the water tower was constantly dropping, from two meters deep to one meter.
    It dropped another ten millimeters!
    It dropped another twenty millimeters!
    Messages of emergency were coming every moment.
    "Water!" "Water!" "Water!" How anxiously concerned people were about the water! The leaders of the power plant decisively decided to implement single-unit operation, and at the same time sent people to the municipal party committee for emergency assistance.
    Soon, a jeep arrived, carrying Xu Hongwen, the gray-haired secretary of the municipal party committee, and Zhang Minghua, the deputy secretary of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company Party Committee. As soon as Xu Hongwen arrived, he conveyed the decision of the municipal party committee to Secretary Chen and Factory Director Wang of the power plant: "You must ensure safe power supply and not stop for a minute."
    "Okay! As long as there is water in the Taizi River, we will definitely guarantee power generation." This was the simple answer of the power plant leaders, representing all the workers in the workshop, to the Party's instructions, and it was also a common oath they made to the Party.
    This solemn oath was conveyed to all the workers in the workshop through the workers' congress that same day around midnight, and it immediately became the common thought and common action of every worker.
      A Steel Water Transmission Line
    In our socialist family, wherever there are difficulties and dangers, leading comrades of the Party will come to share your hardships and breathe the same air, and fraternal units will extend a hand of friendship to you. Early in the morning, Chen Zhongtian, the Party Secretary of the Benxi Iron and Steel Power Plant's Party Committee, and Wang Rongli, the factory director, both waded across the river, and the supporting troops from the fraternal Benxi Mining Bureau, Caitun Coal Mine, Benxi Coal Mine, and the First Steel Plant also arrived. They jointly came up with two brilliant ideas: one was to draw a general-purpose water pump from the factory and install it on the roof of the original second water source to send water to the water tower; the other was to dig a one-zhang deep underground waterway, block the lower opening of the waterway, let the water emerge from the ground and rush into the water tower. After several hours of hard work, both brilliant ideas were implemented, and the water tower increased in water. However, this increase was only a quarter of the power workshop's hourly water consumption, and there was a risk of the source being cut off at any time due to heavy rain.
    The next day—August 5th, the water level in the water tower dropped below one meter, and the "bottom of the pot" had already revealed accumulated purple mud. The situation was even more critical. The Party branch of the workshop reported the situation to the municipal party committee again through a temporary telephone. Another municipal committee meeting, with this workshop as the central topic, began. At the meeting, it was decided to immediately speed up the installation of water pumps along the Taizi River, and at the same time, the city's flood control headquarters issued an emergency notice, notifying the Municipal Party School, the Iron and Steel Institute, the Mining Bureau's organs, and other units to immediately send people with various water-lifting tools to the power workshop! When several armies converged at the power workshop, another intense water-grabbing battle began. The supporting employees were divided into three fronts, extending from the Taizi River bank, the right side of the No. 2 water tower, and the left side to the water tower house, one after another using basins, rice pots, lunch boxes, and all other tools that could store water to add water to the water tower, forming a human water transmission line.
    People hated the rolling floods so much, and they felt extraordinarily precious about the water needed by this workshop. Hu Wenbin, director of the Youth League Committee office of the Mining Bureau, was not in good health. After passing water for a while along the Taizi River, he felt shivering all over and his hands straightened, but he resolutely clenched his teeth and secretly cheered himself on: "One more box of water can generate more electricity, and with electricity, the coal mine can produce! With coal, there will be steel!" So every time he put his arms on his stomach, carefully transferring the water to another comrade. At this time, a worker from the power workshop walked to his side, and Hu Wenbin asked: "How is it going?" The worker looked at him and said, "Not enough!" Hearing this, he carried the water even more happily.
    The teachers and students of the Party School who were panning water in the ditch behind the No. 2 water tower initially used washbasins to transport it. Later, Yu Chunpu thought: "It's not efficient to do this, we should work smartly." He looked around and suddenly found three or four pieces of concave channel steel lying on the ground, and asked Shi Yonglin: "Lao Shi, look, if we put these things up, one end connecting to the ditch and the other end connecting to the water tower, and pour the water into it, the water will flow automatically, won't it be more and faster?" Shi Yonglin agreed as soon as he heard it, so the two of them called a few more people to set up the channel steel. One test, it worked particularly well. Suddenly, the first water transmission line appeared, and in the blink of an eye, the work of dozens of people was replaced by four people.
    At this time, Dai Yuming, a mechanical engineer from the Mining Bureau, and Chen Yongchun, the section chief of the design department, also used their brains: deciding to use pipeline flow. Thinking, they went to the factory building and found several iron pipes, carried them back personally, set them up one after another, and then found some semi-circular tiles used to build houses to replace the iron rings, buckled them at the joints of the water pipes, one end connected to the spring eye, and the other end led to the pool, creating another water transmission line. The employees who fought on this water transmission line did not withdraw until they had completed the water transportation task.
      In the Most Dangerous Moments
    At 8:53 p.m. on August 5th, something serious happened again.
    The 50-horsepower water pump installed on the bank of the Taizi River burned out as soon as the cable was connected. All of the plant's own electricity stopped, and the lights went out. The feed water pump supplying water to the boiler was panting there, and the raging fire in the boiler was dying. Seeing that the steam pressure dropped from 29 to 8, when the steam pressure dropped to 6 atmospheres, the generator was finally forced to stop running.
    At this moment, the dangerous situation of water cut off also occurred in the boiler room. At this time, Deputy Squad Leader and probationary Party member Liu Deren and boiler engineer Ying Dianwen dropped everything and rushed to the scene. Ying Dianwen held a flashlight, illuminating various instruments while operating. Liu Deren had just run to the vicinity of the pressure gauge when he heard Deputy Waterman Chen Wenchao shout: "The water level gauge has no water!" Liu Deren hurriedly ran up and told Waterman Zhang Fucheng to lift water with the water lifting valve. Zhang Fucheng lifted it twice but didn't lift a drop of water.
    At this moment, Liu Deren understood: there was not much water in the boiler. If there was no water, the boiler would burn red, and there would be a risk of explosion when it encountered water. However, he also thought that the fate of Caitun Mine was now entirely in their hands, and forced power supply must be carried out. In such a tense moment, he quickly asked boiler engineer Ying Dianwen for instructions: "Should we add water?"
    "Yes!" Ying Dianwen replied very firmly. Then, he said to everyone: "Everyone pay attention to safety! Those who don't have much to do, step aside, I'll do it!" However, no one retreated.
    At this time, Zhang Yuxiang, the deputy director of the workshop, arrived. For the sake of caution, Liu Deren asked Director Zhang three times: "Add water or not?" "Ignite or not?"
    "Add! Add! We must add it!" "Ignite! Ignite! We must ignite it!" Director Zhang replied resolutely three times in a row.
    Liu Deren immediately turned around and ordered Chen Wenchao: "Open the water gate, steady!" He also told stoker Yang Kuibin: "Ignite as soon as the water comes!" When Chen Wenchao opened the water gate, water poured into the pipe in a while. The workers held their breath and stood firmly at their posts, and no one showed a bit of fear. At this time, stoker Yang Kuibin had been waiting on top of the boiler for half an hour. When he heard the sound from the boiler, indicating that the water was up, his spirits were lifted, and he inserted the fire stick into the furnace.
    The Difficult Pass Before Dawn
    The machine and boiler passed the dangerous period and started to rotate normally. The feed water pump sucked the water from the water tower into the boiler in large gulps. But another dangerous period appeared. This happened before dawn on the 6th. The main source of water after the water source was flooded—mountain water—was gone, and the accumulated water in the factory was also used up. Only the Taizi River was still calling out and venting its remaining power. This was the only hope. However, the temporary water pump installed on the riverbank was still acting up and could not pump water. The water in the water tower was dropping steadily. By 3:00 a.m., there was only half a meter left. According to calculations, if this continued, the power plant would have to be forced to stop running in 30 minutes. The efforts of the two days would be in vain.
    No other methods would be in time. People pinned their hopes on a 50-horsepower water pump that was being installed. To install this water pump, nearly a hundred workers from Benxi Coal Mine and Caitun Coal Mine had worked hard for two days. Due to the continuous drop in the water level of the Taizi River, they moved the water pump four times in a row, and finally moved it near the normal water level of the riverbed.
    At 3:00 a.m. on the 6th, Chen Zhongtian, secretary of the Party Committee of the power plant, came to the river. He reported bad news to the employees installing the water pump: the water in the water tower can only be used for forty minutes. He asked everyone to persevere in these last forty minutes and strive to install the water pump within this time and supply a large amount of water. All employees immediately expressed to the Party that no matter how cunning the Taizi River is, as long as the Taizi River does not dry up, they will pump the water up. Wang Zhanping, an engineer from the Benxi Mining Bureau who participated in the installation of the water pump from beginning to end, had been working nervously. Half an hour, how short it was! The water pump was quickly installed, but it failed to suck water up after several trial runs. So dozens of people checked the lines, pipes, and various parts of the water pump and motor separately, and quickly blocked all the loopholes. At this time, it was 3:30, only ten minutes from the deadline.
    The last ten minutes are coming. The fire truck pours water into a section of the pipe opening. Two of the six screws on this pipe joint are installed, and another five minutes have passed. There are only the last five minutes left. The ruthless time is pressing them. "Give electricity!" With a command, the motor turned, the water pump turned, and water surged up from the river. At the joint of that section of the water pipe, it sprayed out from the unsealed cracks. Everyone was worried about whether the normal water supply could be maintained and whether there would be another accident. At this time, assistant engineers Xu Shuoyan and Li Jiakang quickly took off their raincoats in desperation and tightly wrapped the spraying area, and then tightened the screws one by one. A strong stream of water splashed toward the water tower. Before long, the second water pump also successfully pumped water, and the third also pumped water. The intense battle to seize water and generate electricity finally won a complete victory on the morning of the 7th.
            ×××
    When we visited this heroic workshop, it had long returned to its former tranquility. The Taizi River had already receded to the gate of the water source, the water source had officially begun to supply water, the generator was rumbling, and the water level of the water storage pool had risen to more than two meters. The wisps of thick smoke, symbolizing the complete victory of the workshop's persistence in production and power generation, were rising endlessly in the sky above the Taizi River.

    让电动脉永远跳动
    ——记本钢发电厂第二发电车间的夺水战
    新华社、辽宁日报、本溪日报记者集体采写
    正当特大洪灾严重地威胁着本溪市的时候，在太子河畔的一个小小的工厂车间——本钢发电厂第二发电车间里，为夺取每一滴水，进行了一场动人心魄的紧张战斗。这个车间在党的领导下，工人群众拧成一股绳，依靠全市人民的支援，终于保全了车间，坚持了生产。
    太子河水长流不断，这首英雄的凯歌将被人们永远传颂。
          共同的誓言
    事情发生在8月4日的暴风雨后，太子河水猛涨十米以上，大大超过警戒水位。一时间，洪水淹没了第一水源地，紧接着，第二水源地又被淹没，发电车间的供水来路全部断绝了，光靠发电车间储水塔中的存水，发电机顶多也只能维持半天。而要想恢复水源地，决非一日所能。那知道说话之间，又传来了一个最不幸的消息，电网联结这个车间的一根强大输电线路也被洪水冲断了。
    但是，电是不能停的。如果这个车间一停电。彩屯竖井的运输就会马上断绝，井下水泵就会马上停止排水，地下水就会马上淹没矿井，而依靠彩屯矿供应焦煤的鞍钢，生产就会受到很大影响。发电车间面临着严重的任务。支委紧急扩大会议在支部办公室召开了。全部都是由工人提拔起来的党支部委员、车间主任和工程师们，只有一个共同的回答：“为了彩屯煤矿、为了鞍钢，我们决不能停电。”
    没有水，怎么发电呢？全党一条心，办法就出来了，他们共同商量出了以下三条办法：第一，发动群众出谋献策，到处找水源；第二，截山水入池，打救急；第三，节约用水，不准任何人浪费一滴水。
    支部会后，紧张的抢水战斗就展开了。党支部书记赵春德、副书记吴执义、王全才全部出动，在他们后面，紧跟着刚下班的工人孙龙飞、孙振文、王秉初和刚从家里赶到工厂来的共产党员、老工人刘加丰。他们来到了后山，看见山洪像瀑布飞泉一样地倾泻下来，立即想了一个办法，在储水塔两旁的明沟上，堵起了两道泥墙，把水引向储水塔。可是庞大的储水塔就像个无底洞，杯水车薪，怎能解决问题？
    储水塔里的水位，在不断下降，由二米深降到一米。
    又下降了十个毫米！
    又下降了二十个毫米！
    告急的消息，每时每刻都在传来。
    “水！”“水！”“水！”人们是多么心急如火地为水担心啊！发电厂的领导当机立断地决定：实行单机运转，同时派人紧急向市委求援。
    一会儿，一辆吉普车，载着满鬓白发的市委书记徐宏文、本溪钢铁公司党委副书记张鸣华来到了这个车间。徐宏文一到即向发电厂的陈书记、王厂长传达了市委的决定，“你们一定要保证安全供电，不准停一分钟。”
    “行！只要太子河有水，我们一定保证发电。”这就是发电厂领导，代表全车间工人对党的指示的简单答复，也是他们共同对党发下的誓言。
    这个庄严的誓言，在当天午夜前后，就通过职工大会，贯彻到全车间工人群众中去，立刻变成了每个工人的共同思想和共同行动。
      一条钢铁输水线
    在我们社会主义大家庭里，哪里有困难，哪里有危险，就会有党的领导同志来和你同患难，共呼吸，就会有兄弟单位向你伸出友谊之手。一大早，本钢发电厂的党委书记陈忠田、厂长王荣礼都涉过河水赶来了，兄弟的本溪矿务局、彩屯煤矿、本溪煤矿、第一钢铁厂的各路支援大军也来了。他们共同想出了两条妙计，一条是从厂里抽出一台杂用水泵，安装在原来的第二水源地的房盖上，向储水塔送水；一条是挖断一丈深的地下水道，把水道的下口堵死，让水冒出地面赶进水塔。两件妙计，经过几小时的艰苦努力，都执行了，储水塔增加了水，可是，这个增加数和发电车间每小时需水量来比较，不过是他们每小时耗水量的四分之一，而且随时都有因暴雨中止而断绝来源的危险。
    第二天——8月5日，储水塔里的水位下降到一米以下，“锅底”已经露出了淤积的紫泥。情势更加危急，车间党支部通过临时电话又把情况报告了市委。又一次以这个车间为中心议题的市委会开始了，会上决定，立即加快在太子河沿上安设水泵的速度，同时又由市防汛总指挥部下达了紧急通知，通知市委党校、钢铁学院、矿务局机关等单位：立即派人携带各种提水工具，跑步赶到发电车间送水！当几路大军汇合在发电车间的时候，又一场紧张的抢水战斗打响了。支援的职工分战三路，分别从太子河沿，二号储水塔右侧，左侧三处一直排到储水塔房，一个接一个地用脸盆，饭锅，饭盒等一切可以贮水的工具往储水塔里加水，形成了一条人的输水线。
    人们对于滚滚而来的洪水是那样的憎恨，而对于这个车间所需要的水，又是那样异乎寻常地感到珍贵。矿务局团委办公室主任胡文彬身体不太好，在太子河沿上传了一阵水以后，就觉得浑身哆嗦，两手发直，但毅然咬紧牙关，自己暗暗给自己打气：“多端一盒水就能多发电，有电煤矿就能生产！有煤就有钢铁！”于是他每次都把两支胳膊顶在肚子上，小心翼翼地把水传送给另一个同志。这时候，发电车间一位工人走到他的身旁，胡文彬问：“怎么样了？”工人瞅瞅他，说，“不足啊！”听了这话，他端水端的更欢了。
    在二号储水塔后边地沟里淘水的党校师生们，最初用洗脸盆传送。后来，于春普想：“这么干效率低，应当巧干。”他用眼光四下寻觅，突然发现地下放着三、四块凹形的槽钢，就问石永林：“老石，你看，把这玩艺架起来，一头通地沟，一头通储水塔，把水倒在里边，水自动地淌，不是又多又快吗？”石永林一听，十分赞成，于是他俩又招呼几个人，把槽钢架起来。一试验，特别好使。顿时，出现了第一条输水线，转眼工夫，几十个人的活就被四个人代替了。
    这工夫，矿务局机械工程师戴玉明，设计处科长陈永春等也动了脑筋：决定用管道流水。想着，他们几个人就到厂房周围找了几个铁管，亲自扛回来，一个连一个架好，然后又找些盖房子用的半圆瓦代替铁圈，扣在水管接缝的地方，一头接上泉眼，一头引向水池，又搞成了另一条输水线。战斗在这条输水线的职工们，直到完成了运水任务才收兵。
      在最危险的时刻里
    8月5日晚八点五十三分，严重的事情又发生了。
    安装在太子河岸上的五十马力水泵刚刚把电缆线接上就“叭”的一声烧断了，全厂的自用电全部停止，电灯也不亮了。供给锅炉用水的给水泵呼哧呼哧地在那里喘气，锅炉里的熊熊烈火也奄奄欲熄。眼看着，蒸气由二十九个压力一直降到八个压力，当蒸气压力下降到六个大气压的时候，发电机终于被迫停止运转。
    就在这时，锅炉房里也发生了给水泵断水的险情。这时，只见副班长、预备党员刘德仁和锅炉工程师应殿文丢下一切赶到了现场。应殿文拿着手电筒，一边照着各个仪表，一面操作。刘德仁刚跑到气压表附近，就听副司水员陈文超喊：“水位计没水了！ ”刘德仁急忙跑上来，告诉司水员张福成用吊水阀吊水，张福成连吊了两次也没吊一滴水。
    此刻，刘德仁明白：锅炉里水是不多了，如果一旦没有了水，锅炉烧红了，遇水就有爆炸的危险，可是，他又想到，彩屯矿的命运现在全掌握在他们的手中，必须进行强迫送电。在这样紧张的关头，他连忙请示锅炉工程师应殿文：“让不让上水？”
    “让！”应殿文回答的十分坚定。接着，他对大伙说：“大家要注意安全！事不多的躲一躲，我来！”但是，没有一个人后退。
    这时候，车间副主任张玉祥赶来了。刘德仁为了慎重起见，又连问张主任三声：“上不上水”？“点不点火？”
    “上！上！一定要上”！“点！点！一定要点！”张主任连续坚决地回答了三次。
    刘德仁马上转过身来，命令陈文超：“开水门，稳一点！”又告诉司炉杨奎斌：“上水就点火！”当陈文超开动水门，不一会水就涌进管子里。工人们屏住气，坚守在自己的岗位上，任何人也没有露出一点恐惧的神色。这时候，司炉杨奎斌已经在锅炉顶上等了半个小时，当他听到锅炉里发出音响，说明水上去了，他精神为之一振，一下子就把火棍插到炉膛里去了。
    拂晓前的难关
    机、炉闯过险期正常地转动起来了。给水泵大口大口地把储水塔里的水吸到锅炉。但是又一个险期出现了。这事情发生在6日的拂晓之前，水源地被淹后水的主要来源——山水没有了，厂内的积水也用光了，只有太子河还呼叫着发泄着它的余威，这是唯一的指望了。但是，在河边安的临时水泵还闹脾气，抽不上水来。水塔里的水节节下降，到早晨三时只剩半米了，根据计算，这样下去，发电机只能维持三十分钟。为了救急，市委派来了三辆消防车往水塔里放水，但是这也只能把时间往后延长十分钟，也就是说，如果不采取别的办法，到三时四十分钟，发电厂就得被迫停止运转，两天的努力就将前功尽弃。
    别的办法都来不及了，人们把希望寄托在正在安装中的一台五十马力水泵上。为了安装这台水泵，本溪煤矿和彩屯煤矿来的近百名工人已经苦干了两天。由于太子河的水位连续下降，他们把水泵一连挪了四个地方，最后挪到了正常水位的河床附近。
    到6日晨三时，发电厂党委陈忠田书记来到了河边，他向安装水泵的职工们报告了一个不好的消息：水塔里的水只能用四十分钟了。他要求大家要坚持这最后的四十分钟，力争在这个时刻内安好水泵，大量供水。全体职工当即向党表示，任凭太子河再狡猾，只要太子河不干，就要把水抽上来。从头到尾参加安装水泵的本溪矿务局工程师王占平，一直紧张地在工作。半小时，多么短啊，水泵迅速地装好了，但是一连试转几次都吸不上水来，于是几十个人分头检查了线路、管路和水泵、电动机各个部位，把一切漏洞都迅速地堵了，这时已是三点半，离限期仅有十分钟。
    最后的十分钟快要到了。消防车把引水从一节管子口上灌进去，这个管子接头的六个螺丝安上两个，时间又过了五分钟。只有最后五分钟了，无情的时间在追逼着他们，“给电”一声令下，马达转动了，水泵转动了，水从河里涌上来，到了那节水管的接头处，又从没有接严的缝子里喷出来，能否正常送水，会不会再出事故，大家都很耽心，这时只见助理工程师徐硕雁、李家康情急生智，急忙脱下雨衣把喷水处紧紧包住，然后一个一个地把螺丝拧紧。一股强劲的水流向水塔里飞溅。不多时，第二台水泵也顺利地上水了，第三台也上水了。一场紧张的夺水发电的战斗终于在七日清晨获得全胜。
            ×××
    当我们访问这个英雄的车间的时候，这里早已恢复了往日的平静。太子河已经退往到水源地的闸下，水源地已正式开始送水，发电机在轰鸣地转动着，储水池的水位已经上升到二米以上，象征着这个车间坚持生产、坚持发电获得全胜的缕缕浓烟，永不停息地在太子河上空袅袅上升。
