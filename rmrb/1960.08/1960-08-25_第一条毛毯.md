　　The First Blanket

　　During the arduous years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Party, government, army, and people in the liberated areas all pitched in, launching a large-scale production movement. In addition to agricultural production, regardless of gender, they all learned to use spinning wheels to spin yarn. Comrades with higher skills could spin several liang of cotton in their spare time each day, and they could even operate the wheels and spin yarn at night without lighting a lamp. Those who didn't have spinning wheels used a bamboo chopstick with a wooden support attached to the bottom to twist yarn and twist wool. Relying solely on their own hands, they knitted woolen socks and woolen gloves, and wove coarse cloth and towels. They achieved what Chairman Mao said: "Self-reliance" and "ample food and clothing."

　　At that time, not only ordinary cadres participated in spinning yarn, but also leading comrades of the Party Central Committee. Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Ren Bishi learned to spin yarn using spinning wheels sent by General Wang Zhen, and the yarn they spun even participated in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Agricultural and Industrial Production Achievement Exhibition. In order to vigorously promote the textile industry, the logistics department of the Eighth Route Army manufactured a native machine and used native wool to weave very beautiful and practical blankets. The first blanket produced by the Eighth Route Army Wool Weaving Factory is now on display in the War of Resistance Against Japan Hall of the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution.

    第一条毛毯
    在抗日战争的艰苦岁月中，解放区党、政、军、民一齐动手，掀起了大规模的大生产运动。他们除了进行农业生产以外，当时不分男女，都学着使用纺车纺线，技术高的同志每天在工余时间可纺几两棉花，并且夜里不点灯都可以操车纺线。没有纺车的同志用一根竹筷下边扎一个木托来捻线、捻羊毛，就凭自己的一双手，织出了羊毛袜子和羊毛手套，织出了粗布和毛巾。做到了像毛主席所说的：“自己动手”，“丰衣足食”。
    当时不只是一般干部参加纺线，就是党中央的领导同志也动手纺线。周恩来同志和任弼时同志就用王震将军送的纺车学纺线，并且纺的线还参加了陕甘宁边区农工业生产成绩展览会。八路军后勤部门为了大搞纺织业，他们制造了一台土机器，并用土羊毛织出了十分美观实用的毛毯。八路军毛织厂生产的第一条毛毯，现在就陈列在中国人民革命军事博物馆抗日战争馆内。
