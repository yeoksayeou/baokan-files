Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 3rd: At the preparatory meeting of the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Complete Disarmament on the afternoon of August 2nd, representatives from various countries delivered speeches, condemning the aggression and war policies of U.S. imperialism and expressing support for the just and patriotic anti-U.S. struggle of the Japanese people.

The French representative, Paul Vigier, paid tribute to the Japanese people in his speech. He said that the Japanese people had waged a heroic struggle against the dangerous military alliance treaty. Dr. Vigier suggested that the conference should pass a special resolution expressing support for the struggle of the Japanese people.

The representative of the German Democratic Republic, Doibner, spoke. He reported on the struggle of his country's government and people for the reunification of Germany and the elimination of West German militarism. He then read out a congratulatory letter from the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, to the conference.

The West German representative, Bei Weisdorf, then spoke. He emphasized the need to strengthen the common struggle between the Japanese and West German people. He pointed out that the Japanese and German people should learn from each other's experiences in the struggle for peace.

The Hungarian representative, Sandor Becker, emphasized that the Japanese people had set a brilliant example to the people of the world on how to fight the enemies of peace when he talked about the Japanese people’s struggle for peace.

The Indian representative, Mansur Gilani, emphasized that his delegation hoped that the Sixth World Conference would conduct a vigorous struggle against imperialism and colonialism. He said, "As long as there is imperialism, there will be no stable world peace."

Gilani called on people to support the struggles of the people of Congo, Cuba, and Korea against U.S. imperialism.

The Indonesian representative said that the peace movement and the national independence movement are inseparable. He added that the Japanese people's struggle against the new "Security Treaty" is precisely an example of this inseparability. He said, "Let us further strengthen the solidarity of the people of Asia and Africa."

The Kenyan representative exposed the aggression of imperialism against the whole of Africa. He said, "The days of imperialism in Africa are numbered. Now they are taking all kinds of means and actions to maintain their rule."

While detailing the national independence movements in the Congo and Kenya, he also said, "The people of these countries are risking their lives for the just cause of national independence, and they will surely win independence in the very near future."

The representative of Korean residents vividly described the war preparations being carried out by the American troops in South Korea. He said that the Korean people will surely drive the American troops out of the country and realize the reunification of the country.

The Mexican representative, Eriverto Hara, and the Sudanese representative, Ahmed Mohammed Keir, then spoke at the meeting. Keir emphasized, "Imperialism is now facing complete decline." He pointed out that the people of all countries should actively participate in the struggle against the imperialists and strive for peace.

Keir then said, "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Asian and African countries and the people of all countries in the world. The Japanese people have received the support of the people of African countries in their struggle against this common enemy. The struggle of the Japanese people is of great help to the people of African countries who are struggling against imperialism, and it helps the people of African countries to more clearly understand the nature of imperialism."

Keir concluded, "On behalf of the people of my country, I sincerely hope that the Japanese people, while advancing their struggle to abolish all American bases on their territory, recover Okinawa, and strive for the establishment of true democracy, will strengthen their solidarity with the people of African countries."

The Soviet representative, Alexander Bulgakov, spoke. He gave a high appraisal of the contributions made by the Japanese people to the cause of world peace.

The U.S. representative, Steven Fritschman, spoke at the meeting, expressing his intention to work to stop nuclear testing.

The Vietnamese representative, Wei Ru Kuncong, said that the Japanese people's movement against the "Security Treaty" greatly encouraged the Vietnamese people. He condemned the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam, saying: "U.S. imperialism, while talking about peace in words, is shamelessly suppressing the struggle of the South Vietnamese people for peace and national independence, in order to cooperate with reactionary forces in various countries to prepare for a nuclear war." He said that in order to safeguard world peace, world peace forces must expose the nature of U.S. imperialism and continuously fight against imperialism.

Zheng Shenyu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Peace Council, warmly praised the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism. He said that this struggle has inspired the people all over the world.

Fan Wute, the representative of the World Federation of Trade Unions, emphasized that the Japanese people's boycott of Eisenhower's visit to Japan was of great significance. "The struggle of the Japanese people has aroused a worldwide response and brought about an upsurge in the struggles of people of all countries in the world."

Representatives of international organizations such as the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the World Federation of Scientific Workers, and the War Resisters' International also spoke at the meeting.
