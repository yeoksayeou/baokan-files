Focusing on Forestry, Comprehensive Utilization, and Diversified Operations
United Enterprises Established in Most Forest Areas of Heilongjiang

(Our Dispatch) This reporter, Han Zhifei, reports: Since the establishment of people's communes in the forest areas of Heilongjiang Province, they have played a significant role in promoting the great development of comprehensive timber utilization. At present, most forest areas in the province have established united enterprises that focus on forestry, engage in diversified operations, and promote comprehensive utilization.

Recently, this reporter saw in the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area: Timber farms, which used to be engaged solely in timber production, have built comprehensive timber utilization factories. At the same time, the iron and steel machinery industry, the building materials industry, and the non-staple food production bases in the forest areas are also being actively built. Currently, more than 300 "native and foreign" combined forest farm factory groups (six or seven factories per group) have been built in more than 500 forest farms across the province, producing more than 100 kinds of products. The establishment of these factory groups not only enables the full utilization of the rich resources of the forest areas, but also enables the forest areas to play a greater role in supporting national construction.

Two years ago, when this reporter came here for an interview, I only saw large quantities of high-quality timber being transported to all parts of the country. Now, with these factory groups, the situation in the forest areas is very different. In the past, what used to be waste, such as branches, roots, bark, and leaves, has now become a valuable raw material for newly established factories, producing small-sized timber, fiberboard, wood wool board and other artificial boards; chemical raw materials such as rosin, tannin extract, and pyroligneous acid; various oils such as pine root oil and turpentine; as well as woodware, furniture, paper, tool handles, and building materials, to support national economic construction.

The Heilongjiang forest area, which is responsible for about one-third of the country's timber production, has made great progress in comprehensive timber utilization since the Great Leap Forward. In particular, after the establishment of people's communes in the forest areas, this new type of grassroots social organization has shown boundless vitality. Thirty-nine people's communes in the forest areas throughout the province have mobilized large numbers of housewives to participate in social labor. These communes, starting from scratch and making do with whatever was available, have established more than 2,100 comprehensive timber utilization factories. This reporter visited some of these factory groups in the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area and saw that after a tree was felled, almost everything from the branches and bark to the roots and leaves could be utilized. According to calculations: a large tree with a diameter at breast height of 32 centimeters and a height of 27 meters, before comprehensive utilization, would only yield 1.36 cubic meters of commercial timber, worth 51 yuan, 7 jiao, and 2 fen. After comprehensive utilization, it can create wealth of 153 yuan and 6 jiao. The utilization rate of a tree has also increased from 46% to 80%. Now, both thick and thin branches, after simple processing in the waste material processing plant, become various small-sized timber and agricultural tool materials. In the paper-making workshop of the Yidong Forestry Bureau's timber processing plant, workers use unpeeled tree branches to make pulp and produce high-quality paper. In the past, tree bark in the forest areas was waste, but now it has become a valuable raw material for extracting tannin extract. The tannin extract factories established everywhere use tree bark to extract tannin extract. Pine roots in the past could only be used by housewives as kindling when cooking, but today they are used to refine rosin that the country urgently needs. Most of the rosin factories in the forest areas were established by housewives in the absence of equipment, technicians, and factory buildings. They brought iron basins and aluminum basins from home, dug up pine roots from the forest, and used pots to steam and refine rosin.

After comprehensive timber utilization, a tree, from its trunk to its branches, from its roots to its leaves, from its bark to its sap, from its finished product to its waste material, from its small side wood to its sawdust, is fully utilized. In the timber processing plants in the forest areas, the artificial fiberboard processed from bark, strips, and shavings is called "wood without defects." This artificial board not only has the advantages of being hard, wear-resistant, non-expanding, non-shrinking, non-warping, and non-splitting, but also eliminates the defects of natural wood such as knots, discoloration, decay, and wormholes. Furniture made from this artificial board, such as wardrobes, sewing machine tabletops, desks, and sofas, are not only cheap but also beautiful and durable.

Building comprehensive timber utilization factories in the forest areas can make full use of the resources of the forest areas, such as tree branches, roots, and bark, which are everywhere. For example, for the raw materials of rosin factories, workers only need to take a can or a glass bottle to the large pine trees in the forest, scrape off the flowing resin, or dig up the pine roots after logging, which are good raw materials for refining rosin. At the same time, building comprehensive timber utilization factories in the forest areas also has sources of iron and steel, building materials, and labor. Forestry workers themselves mine ore, smelt iron and steel, and manufacture some equipment and mechanical parts needed by comprehensive utilization factories. In the past, due to the single timber production, the family members of forestry workers could not participate in social labor, but now they have become the main force in carrying out comprehensive timber utilization. Among the 50,000 workers in comprehensive utilization factories throughout the province, 80% are housewives.

At present, Party organizations at all levels in the forest areas of Heilongjiang Province are leading forestry workers to further develop the cause of comprehensive timber utilization, using the method of starting from "semi-, indigenous, and small" to vigorously establish forest farm factory groups centered on waste material processing, comprehensive timber utilization, and forest chemical plants; and are carrying out technical transformation on the already-built forest farm factory groups, transitioning from "small indigenous groups" to "small foreign groups," to produce more and better forest chemical products for the country and support national construction.

    以林为主　综合利用　多种经营
    黑龙江大部林区建成联合企业
    本报讯　记者韩之非报道：黑龙江省林区大办人民公社以后，对促进木材综合利用事业大发展，起了巨大作用。目前，全省大部林区，已建成以林业为主，进行多种经营，综合利用的联合企业。
    最近，记者在小兴安岭林区看到：一向是单一木材生产的林场里，建起了一座座木材综合利用工厂，同时，林区里的钢铁机械工业、建筑材料工业、副食品生产基地也都在积极兴建。目前，在全省五百多个林场里，已建成土洋结合的林场工厂群三百多个（六、七个厂为一群），生产着百余种产品。这些工厂群的建立，不仅使林区的丰富资源得到充分利用，而且使林区在支援国家建设中发挥着更大的作用。
    两年前，记者到这里采访时，还只是看到大批的优良木材运往全国。现在，有了这些工厂群，林区的情景就大不相同了。过去曾是废物的枝丫、树根、树皮、树叶，现在都成了新办工厂的宝贵原料，生产出了小规格材、纤维板、木丝板等各种人造板；松香、栲胶、醋石等化工原料，和松根油、松节油等各种油类，以及木器、家具、纸张、工具柄和建筑材料等产品，支援国家经济建设。
    担负全国木材生产任务三分之一左右的黑龙江林区，大跃进以来，木材综合利用有了很大的发展。特别是林区大办人民公社后，这个新型的基层社会组织，显示出无限的生命力，全省林区三十九个人民公社，大批家庭妇女参加了社会劳动。这些公社因陋就简、白手起家的办起两千一百多个木材综合利用工厂。记者在小兴安岭林区，访问了一些这样的工厂群，看到一棵树木被伐倒后，从树的枝丫、树皮直到树根、树叶，几乎没有一样不能被利用的。据计算：一棵胸高直径三十二厘米、高二十七米的大树，综合利用前只出商品材一点三六立方米，值五十一元七角二分，综合利用以后，就能创造出一百五十三元六角的财富。一棵树的利用率也由46％提高到80％。现在，不管是粗、细的枝丫，经过废材加工厂的简易加工，就变成了各种小规格材和农具材。在伊东林业局木材加工厂的造纸车间，职工们用未经剥皮的树枝丫做纸浆，造出来质量很好的纸张。过去，林区里的树皮是废物，现在却变成了炼栲胶的宝贵原料，各处办起的栲胶厂都利用树皮炼栲胶。松树根在过去只能给家庭妇女烧饭时作引火柴用，今天却炼出国家迫切需要的松香。林区里的松香厂，大部分是家庭妇女在一无设备、二无技术人员、三无厂房的情况下办起来的。她们从家里拿来铁盆、铝盆，从森林里刨来松根，用锅蒸煮提炼松香。
    木材综合利用后，就把一棵树从树干到树枝，从树根到树叶，从树皮到树汁，从成材到废料，从小边材到锯末，充分利用起来了。在林区的木材加工厂里，用板皮、板条和刨花加工出来的人造纤维板被称为“没有缺点的木材”，这种人造板不仅具有坚硬、耐磨、不膨胀、不收缩、也不翘曲、不间裂等优点，它还消除了天然木材中的节疤、变色、腐朽和虫眼等缺点。用这种人造板制造成的家具，像衣橱、缝纫机台板、写字台、沙发等，不仅价格便宜，而且美观、坚固。
    在林区建设木材综合利用工厂，可以充分利用林区的资源，像树枝丫、树根、树皮，到处都有。如松香厂的原料，工人们只要拿着一个罐头盒或者一个玻璃瓶，到森林里的大松树上，把流出来的树脂刮下来，或者把采伐后的松树根刨出来，都是提炼松香的好原料。同时，在林区建设木材综合利用工厂，也有钢铁、建筑材料和劳动力的来源，林业工人自己挖矿石、炼钢铁、制造综合利用工厂所需的一些设备和机械零件；在过去由于单一木材生产，而不能参加社会劳动的林业职工家属，成为大搞木材综合利用的主要力量，全省五万名综合利用工厂的工人中，80％是家庭妇女。
    目前，黑龙江省林区各级党组织，正领导林业职工进一步发展木材综合利用事业，用从“半、土、小”作起的方法，大办以废材加工、木材综合利用，和林化工厂为中心的林场工厂群；对已建成的林场工厂群正进行技术改造，由“小土群”向“小洋群”过渡，为国家生产出更多更好的林化产品，支援国家建设。（附图片）
