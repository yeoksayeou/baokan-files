Conscientiously Strengthen the Front Line to Seize a Bumper Autumn Harvest
Gansu and Inner Mongolia Transfer Large Numbers of Cadres to Communes
Southern Jiangxi Transfers 40% to 50% of Cadres to Settle in Rural Areas

This newspaper reports that in order to further strengthen the grassroots leadership on the agricultural front, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to transfer 5,000 cadres from agencies above the county level to production teams to serve as deputy captains and deputy secretaries. This is another important measure taken by the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China after mobilizing 100,000 cadres to go deep into the front line of agricultural production.

The Provincial Committee's decision has been translated into practical action throughout the province. Cadres at the provincial, district, and county levels have been writing applications and expressing their determination to work in the most arduous places. In the Pingliang area, 729 cadres, under the slogan of "Going up the mountains and into the gullies, settling down and making a home," have gone to production teams in remote areas to take up positions. Li Lin, the newly appointed Party branch secretary of the Tuanjie Production Team of the Zaosheng Commune in Ning County, took the lead in harvesting wheat with the commune members during the day and watched the threshing ground and studied work arrangements with them at night after arriving at his post. In the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, each of the more than 600 production teams has an average of one cadre selected and sent by the prefectural and county-level agencies. After arriving at their posts, these cadres live among the masses, eat in the canteen, and work and labor in the fields. Wei Banghua, the deputy Party branch secretary of the Daling Production Team of the Chenjing Commune in Linxia City, found that using a shovel to weed was inefficient while weeding with commune members, so he worked with the commune members to develop a simple weeding machine, which greatly improved weeding efficiency.

To date, more than 4,000 cadres have been sent by the province, prefecture, and county levels to production teams to take up positions. Some cadres who have not yet departed are being given short-term training in various places, and they will all arrive at their new posts in August.

This newspaper reports that in order to strengthen the leadership of the rural and pastoral people's communes and promote the great development of agricultural and animal husbandry production, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee recently decided, based on the current situation of the existing rural and pastoral people's communes in the region, to transfer 5% of the banner and county-level party member cadres from the league and municipal-level agencies to work in the communes. The cadres to be transferred are required to have a high degree of communist consciousness and policy theory level, and have certain practical work experience, and be able to serve as the first secretary or secretary of the commune party committee.

In addition, the Party Committee has also decided to support agricultural and animal husbandry production and strengthen the work on the front line by assigning party and government departments in the autonomous region to take charge of some key banners and counties. The task of taking charge is to send cadres down to be stationed in batches on a regular basis to gain experience and promote it. This will not only strengthen grassroots work, but also combine the central task of agricultural and animal husbandry production to do a good job in their own business experimental fields.

The Party Committee requires all cadres who go deep into the rural and pastoral areas to eat, live, work, and consult with the masses, and to earnestly promote the great development of agricultural and animal husbandry production.

According to news from the Jiangxi Daily, the Gannan District Party Committee has decided, on the basis of the past rotation of cadres to work in the countryside, to transfer another 40% to 50% of the cadres to the countryside to lead the masses to seize a bumper autumn harvest. The cadres who go to the countryside will respectively hold leadership positions at all levels from the commune to the production team. The district party committee secretary, ministers, administrative office director, and section chiefs must go down. If there are two cadres above the section level, one must go down; if there are three, two must go down.

Comrade Liu Jianhua, the first secretary of the District Party Committee, made a mobilization report to support agriculture at a conference attended by more than 4,000 cadres convened by the District Party Committee. After explaining the significance of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, Comrade Liu Jianhua called on the comrades on the agricultural front in the Gannan District to focus all their efforts on agriculture, and the comrades on other fronts must actively support agriculture. Every cadre should ask himself what he has contributed to agriculture? Everyone should use their wisdom and strength to do a good thing or even several good things for agriculture. He said that our slogan is: excellent cadres go to the countryside, to the front line of production, to the most backward and lowest-yielding places, to change the face of the place, to turn backwardness into advancement, and to turn low yield into high yield.

The organs of the District Party Committee are also improving their leadership methods and implementing a major revolution in work style. The leading organs must also move to the countryside, go to the front line of production to work, and go to the front line of production to hold meetings.

Now all units are responding to the call of the District Party Committee and are determined to support agriculture well. Ganzhou City has transferred 66% of its cadres to the grassroots level to work with the masses to strive for a bumper autumn harvest.

    切实加强第一线夺取秋粮丰收
    甘肃内蒙古抽调大批干部下放到公社
    赣南抽调40％到50％的干部到农村生根落户
    本报讯　中共甘肃省委为进一步加强农业战线的基层领导，决定从县级以上各机关抽调五千名干部，下放到生产队担任副队长、副支书。这是中共甘肃省委继动员十万干部深入农业生产第一线之后，采取的又一项重要措施。
    省委这一决定，已在全省变成实际行动。省、专、县各级机关干部，纷纷写申请、表决心，要求到最艰苦的地方去工作。平凉专区已有七百二十九名干部，在“上山进沟、安家落户”的口号下，分别到边远地区的生产队任职。宁县早胜公社团结生产队新任职的党支部书记李林，到达工作岗位后，白天带头和社员一起收麦，晚上和社员一起看场、研究安排工作。临夏回族自治州的六百多个生产队，平均每个队已有一名由州、县级机关选派的干部。这批干部到达工作岗位后，都住在群众中，吃在食堂，工作、劳动在田间。临夏市陈井公社大岭生产队党支部副书记魏邦华，在和社员一起锄草中，发现用铲子锄效率低，就和社员一起研究制了一种简易锄草机，大大提高了锄草工效。
    到目前为止，省、地、县三级派往生产队任职的干部，已达四千多人。部分尚未出发的干部，正由各地集中进行短期训练，他们将在8月份全部到达新的工作岗位。
    本报讯　为加强农村牧区人民公社的领导力量，促进农牧业生产的大发展，内蒙古党委最近根据目前全区现有农村牧区人民公社情况，决定从盟、市以上机关中抽调5％的旗县级党员干部到公社工作。对抽调的干部都要求具有较高的共产主义觉悟和政策理论水平，并有一定实际工作经验，能够胜任公社党委第一书记或书记职务的干部。
    另外，党委还决定由自治区党、政各部门分别包干一些重点旗县的办法，支援农牧业生产，加强第一线的工作。包干的任务是：定期分批轮流派干部下去驻扎，取得经验加以推广。这样既能够加强基层工作，又结合农牧业生产这一中心工作搞好自己的业务试验田。
    党委要求所有深入农村牧区的干部，做到与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，踏踏实实地促进农牧业生产的大发展。
    据江西日报消息　赣南区党委决定，在过去轮流抽调干部下去劳动的基础上，再次抽调40％—50％的干部到农村，领导群众夺取秋粮丰收。到农村去的干部，将分别担任从公社到生产小队的各级领导职务。区党委书记、部长、行署主任、处长都要下去。科级以上的干部有二个的下去一个，三个的下去两个。
    区党委第一书记刘建华同志在区党委召开的四千多名干部参加的大会上，作了支援农业的动员报告。刘建华同志在阐明了农业是国民经济的基础的意义之后，号召赣南区农业战线的同志，必须全力抓农业，其他战线上的同志必须积极支援农业。每个干部都要问一问自己对农业贡献了什么？每个人都要发挥自己的智慧和力量，为农业办一件好事甚至几件好事。他说，我们的口号是：优秀干部到农村中去，到生产第一线去，到工作最落后、产量最低的地方去，到那里去改变面貌，变落后为先进，变低产为高产。
    区党委机关也正在改进领导方法，实行工作作风大革命，领导机关也要搬到农村去，到生产第一线去办公，到生产第一线去开会。
    现在各单位都纷纷响应区党委号召，决心好好支援农业。赣州市已抽调66％的干部深入基层，同群众一道，力争秋季丰收。
