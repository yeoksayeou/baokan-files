Xinhua News Agency, August 29th:
    Seizing the golden season to produce more iron and steel, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company sets off a new upsurge in production competition.
    The employees of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, who are actively discussing the production increase and economy practice plan, have set off a vigorous new upsurge in production competition. Since late August, the average daily output level of steel and iron in this company has increased by 13.9% and 1.98% respectively compared with mid-August, and the quality qualification rate has reached over 99%. The medium and small-sized rolling mills have already completed the annual steel production plan ahead of schedule on August 25th.
    Converter steelmaking workers have launched a competition between shifts and furnaces, focusing on measures to shorten blowing time and extend furnace life. The workers of Ma Xiaoliu's steelmaking team in Class A took the lead in this competition, constantly setting high-yield records. Three-ton electric furnace workers, together with factory technicians and students from the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, successfully modified the automatic charging equipment, shortening the charging time by two-thirds. At the same time, in response to the irregular raw material specifications, they developed a two-step charging method, which greatly shortened the smelting time and significantly increased steel production by 20%.
    In late August, ironmaking workers launched a technical performance competition to achieve the September production level ahead of schedule. In order to achieve the competition goal of charging 88 batches per shift, workers at No. 3 blast furnace adopted specific measures based on the furnace conditions for each shift. The ditch workers of the three shifts exchanged experiences on hauling more and running faster, and cooperated closely in operation. As a result, the number of charges in each shift exceeded 88 batches. Wang Deshun's team created a record of 96 batches charged on the 26th. With the deepening of this competition, the pig iron output of this blast furnace has been rising day by day. The average daily output in early August increased by 3.4% compared with late July, and the increase in mid-August was 17.45% compared with early August. Since late August, several daily pig iron production records have been created, achieving the higher production plan targets for September ahead of schedule.
    Concentrate Strength, Attack Key Points: Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant Achieves Leap Forward in Coke and Steel
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: The workers of Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant have concentrated their superior forces and attacked the key points of production in the production increase and economy practice movement, and have achieved preliminary victories.
    Under the leadership of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the plant began on August 8th to concentrate its superior forces to first solve the problem of increasing coke raw material production. At that time, the output of the plant's original No. 1 coking furnace could not meet the needs of steelmaking, and the finishing work of the newly built No. 2 coking furnace had not been completed and could not be put into production. The factory Party committee decided to concentrate its superior forces to quickly complete the finishing work of the No. 2 coking furnace and put it into production immediately; at the same time, it launched a crash program to build two lime kilns. Factory Party committee secretaries and other leading cadres personally camped and settled down next to the coking furnace to guide construction. The workers used the charging and coke pushing equipment of one coke oven to supply the production of two coke ovens, ensuring that the No. 2 coking furnace was put into production ahead of schedule, and the daily output of coke increased by 37%. The two lime kilns have also been completed and put into production as planned, ensuring the needs of iron and steel making.
    The rapid increase in coke raw material production encouraged the plant's employees. Since the 17th, the plant has concentrated its superior forces to strive for high steel output. The factory Party committee established a high-yield iron and steel headquarters, with leading cadres assigned to lead the work in seven aspects: coke, steelmaking, rolling, infrastructure construction, raw material supply and transportation, living, and ideological education, and closely cooperated with each other. Cadres from various departments formed shock brigades to support workshops, work sections, and teams. The workers in the two main workshops, ironmaking and steelmaking, have held meetings in recent days to study specific measures to ensure high iron and steel production. In order to implement the smelting method of "strong wind, high temperature, and refined materials," the ironmaking workshop recently added a large blower. The workshop workers launched competition matches from the 17th, and many workers of the same type signed competition contracts with each other. The entire workshop immediately formed a situation of catching up with each other, which has continuously increased the daily output of pig iron. With the daily output on the 17th as 100, it increased to 117 on the 19th, and then to 128 on the 20th. The steelmaking workshop also set off a high tide of production increase and economy practice labor competition. The workers of Classes A, B, and C challenged and responded to each other, and steel production also increased as a result.
    Increase Output, Improve Quality: Employees of Anyang Iron and Steel Company Catch Up With Each Other
Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: The employees of Anyang Iron and Steel Company in Henan Province have launched a production increase and economy practice movement centered on high yield, high quality, multiple varieties, and low cost, striving to overfulfill the steel production target in the next four months. In mid-August, the output of pig iron, steel, and steel products increased by 30.1%, 30.5%, and 2.1% respectively compared with the first ten days of the month; the output of ore and coke also increased significantly.
    At present, various types of work and work processes in this company have launched production increase and economy practice competitions. The coal washing workers in the first workshop of the coking plant knew that reducing the ash content of coke by 1% could increase the output of the blast furnace by 2%. They immediately took a series of measures such as uniform charging, diligent slag removal, and establishing special personnel to supervise quality, so that the ash content of the coal was reduced by 11.8% compared to the original, creating conditions for reducing the ash content of coke. The workers of the three shifts in the sintering section of the first raw material workshop of the ironmaking plant launched a competition to let the blast furnace consume more rich ore and produce more iron, which quickly increased the average shift output of sintered ore by more than 60%. The workers of the steelmaking plant adopted a method that combines competition among the same type of work with a one-stop collaboration competition between upper and lower work processes. In the overproduction competition centered on increasing furnace life, in addition to carrying out competitions in the same type of work such as furnace lining, pig iron melting, converter, and casting, the upper and lower work processes also provided guarantees and conducted competitions, achieving a one-to-one protection for each work process, linking each link tightly, so that the furnace lining life quickly increased from 22 heats to 33 heats, and the highest reached 53 heats, with an output increase of 46.9%.
    Concentrating superior forces to attack the key points of production is an important measure for this company to achieve production increase and economy practice. For example, the ironmaking plant, in response to the low efficiency of manual screening and washing operations in powder ore sintering, cooperated with the machine repair department to manufacture a cylindrical vibrating screen and install a magnetic separator, basically realizing the mechanization of screening and washing.

    趁黄金季节多炼钢铁  石钢掀起生产竞赛新高潮
    据新华社29日讯　盛暑已过，钢铁生产战线上的黄金季节已经到来。正在积极讨论增产节约计划的石景山钢铁公司职工，掀起了轰轰烈烈的生产竞赛新高潮。8月下旬以来，这个公司钢铁的平均日产水平分别比中旬提高了13.9％和1.98％，质量合格率达到99％以上；中小型轧钢车间在8月25日已经提前完成全年钢材生产计划。
    转炉炼钢工人围绕缩短吹炼时间、延长炉龄的措施，展开了班与班、炉与炉的竞赛。甲班马小六炼钢小组的工人们在这场竞赛中一马当先，连创高产纪录。三吨电炉工人和工厂技术人员、北京钢铁学院学生一起改装自动化装料设备成功，使装料时间缩短三分之二；同时针对原料规格不够整齐的情况，研究出两次上料的方法，使冶炼时间大大缩短，钢产量猛增20％。
    炼铁工人在8月下旬就展开了提前达到9月份生产水平的技术表演赛。三高炉工人为了达到每班下料八十八批的竞赛目标，每班都根据炉况采取具体措施，三班地沟工人交流了多拉快跑的经验，在操作中互相密切配合，结果8月下旬以来，各个班的上料次数纷纷超过八十八批，王德顺班在26日创造了上料九十六批的纪录。随着这一竞赛的深入开展，这座高炉的生铁产量逐日上升，8月上旬平均日产量比7月下旬增长了3.4％，中旬比上旬提高了17.45％。下旬以来，几次创造了日产生铁最高纪录，提前达到了9月份更高的生产计划指标。
    集中力量　攻打关键  广州钢铁厂焦炭钢铁齐跃进
    据新华社广州电　广州钢铁厂职工，在增产节约运动中，集中优势力量，攻打生产关键，已取得初步胜利。
    在中共广州市委的领导下，这个厂从8月8日开始，集中优势力量，先解决焦炭原料的增产问题。当时，厂里原有的一号炼焦炉的产量不能满足炼钢的需要，而新建的二号炼焦炉的收尾工程尚未完工，不能投入生产。工厂党委决定首先集中优势力量，迅速完成二号炼焦炉的收尾工程，立即投入生产；同时突击建设两座石灰窑。工厂党委书记等领导干部，亲自到炼焦炉旁安营扎寨，指导建设。工人们用一个焦炉的上料设备和推焦设备，供应两个焦炉生产使用，保证了二号炼焦炉提前生产，焦炭日产量因此提高37％。两座石灰窑，也已按计划建成投入生产，保证了炼铁炼钢的需要。
    焦炭原料的迅速获得增产，鼓舞了全厂职工。从17日开始，全厂又集中优势力量，争取钢铁高产。工厂党委成立了钢铁高产指挥部，由领导干部分工领导焦炭、炼钢、轧钢、基建、原材料供应运输、生活、思想教育等七个方面的工作，互相密切配合。各个科室的干部组成了突击大队，到车间、工段、小组支援。炼铁、炼钢两个主要车间的职工，连日来纷纷举行会议，研究保证钢铁高产的具体措施。炼铁车间为了贯彻“大风、高温、精料”的冶炼方法，最近增添了一台大型鼓风机。车间职工从17日起展开了对口赛，许多同工种工人互相签订了竞赛合同，全车间立即形成你追我赶的局面，使生铁的日产量不断增加，以17日的日产量为一百，19日提高到一百一十七，20日又提高到一百二十八。炼钢车间也掀起了增产节约劳动竞赛的高潮，甲、乙、丙三班工人互相挑战应战，钢产量也因此增加。
    增加产量　提高质量  安阳钢铁公司职工你追我赶
    据新华社郑州电　河南省安阳钢铁公司职工，开展以高产、优质、多品种、低成本为中心的增产节约运动，力争今后四个多月钢铁超产。8月中旬，生铁、钢、钢材的产量比上旬分别提高了30.1％、30.5％和2.1％；矿石、焦炭的产量也有显著增长。
    目前，这个公司的各工种、各工序之间，都展开了增产节约竞赛。焦化厂第一车间洗煤工人知道焦炭灰分降低1％，就可以使高炉产量提高2％，立即采取上料均匀、勤出渣、建立专人监督质量等一系列措施，使煤的灰分比原来降低了11.8％，为降低焦炭灰分创造了条件。炼铁厂第一原料车间烧结工段三个班的工人，为了让高炉多吃富矿多产铁，展开你追我赶的竞赛，使烧结矿的平均班产量迅速提高了60％以上。炼钢厂工人采取了同工种竞赛和上下工序一条龙协作竞赛相结合的方法。他们在以提高炉龄为中心的超产竞赛中，除了开展炉衬、化铁、转炉、浇铸等同工种竞赛以外，上、下工序也互提保证，进行竞赛，作到了各工序一环保一环，环环扣紧，使炉衬寿命迅速由二十二炉提高到三十三炉，最高达到五十三炉，产量提高了46.9％。
    集中优势力量，攻打生产关键，是当前这个公司实现增产节约的一项重要措施。如炼铁厂针对粉矿烧结中筛洗手工操作的效率不高的情况，和机修部通力协作，制造出圆筒震动筛，安装了磁选机，基本实现了筛、洗机械化。
