    Liao Chengzhi's Speech at the Capital's Rally in Support of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs
    The Japanese People Have Made Great Contributions to the Cause of Peace
    The Chinese Government's Peace Initiatives Conform to the Common Interests and Aspirations of All People in Asia and the Pacific Region. The People of the World Must Unite into a Broad United Front to Resolutely Crush the Aggression and War Policies of U.S. Imperialism.
    Comrades, friends:
    The Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Comprehensive Disarmament will officially open in Tokyo, Japan, tomorrow. This conference is being held under the great situation of an unprecedented upsurge in the movement of Asian and world people against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace, especially the heroic Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty has achieved major victories, so it is of very important significance. The Chinese people warmly welcome and fully support the convening of the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Comprehensive Disarmament. Chinese people's organizations have sent a delegation headed by Comrade Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, to Tokyo to participate in the conference. We sincerely wish the conference success and wish the conference will make new and greater contributions to the Japanese people and the people of the world in opposing the use of nuclear weapons, opposing the imperialist war and aggression forces headed by the United States, and defending world peace.
    Everyone remembers that fifteen years ago, the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, which caused unprecedented disasters to the Japanese people. The Japanese people have also suffered the most and the greatest harm from the U.S. hydrogen bomb tests. For the fifteen years since the war, the Japanese people have been at the forefront of the struggle against the use of nuclear weapons, persistently opposing U.S. military bases, opposing the revival of Japanese militarism and arming Japan with nuclear weapons, opposing the U.S. occupation of Okinawa, and opposing the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' planning of new war conspiracies, and have been carrying out a heroic struggle for Japan's independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. In the past two years, the heroic Japanese people have launched an upsurge of nationwide struggles against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, against U.S. imperialism and its agents. In the flames of struggle, the Japanese people have formed an increasingly broad and increasingly strong anti-American patriotic united front. In the struggle, the Japanese people have become increasingly aware, their unity has been continuously strengthened, and their strength has rapidly grown. The twenty-two nationwide unified actions launched by the Japanese people have severely hit the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. Under the powerful struggle and pressure of the Japanese people, U.S. imperialism's head, Eisenhower, had to cancel his visit to Japan, and Kishida Nobusuke, the U.S. imperialism's loyal agent in Japan, had to step down. The victory of the Japanese people's struggle has seriously disrupted the U.S. imperialism's aggressive plans and war deployments in the Far East, powerfully encouraged the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America and all countries in the world against imperialism and colonialism, and made great contributions to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world.
    The Japanese people's struggle is an important part of the world people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and in defense of world peace. It has received the universal sympathy and support of the people of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people in the world. The people all over the world are delighted and encouraged by the achievements made by the Japanese people in their struggle. Recently, the meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council held in Stockholm with representatives from more than fifty countries unanimously passed a resolution supporting the Japanese people's struggle against the use of nuclear weapons and the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and pointed out that "this struggle of the Japanese people is not only unprecedented in Japanese history, but also greatly encourages the cause of world peace and the struggle against aggression." The victory of the Japanese people once again proves that as long as the broad masses of the people are united and persist in the struggle, any conspiracy of imperialism and its running dogs can be completely defeated and smashed.
    The Chinese people have always firmly supported the Japanese people's desire to take the road of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and firmly supported the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the use of atomic weapons, against U.S. military bases, against the U.S. occupation Okinawa, and against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Not long ago, when the Japanese people launched a huge anti-American patriotic struggle storm, the Chinese people held rallies and demonstrations with 20 million people participating nationwide, launching a widespread mass movement to support the Japanese people. The Japanese people's struggle and their victory have given the Chinese people great encouragement and support. In the struggle against the common enemy of U.S. imperialism, the Chinese and Japanese people support each other, encourage each other, and advance hand in hand, and the friendship between the two peoples has been further developed. This friendship formed and developed by the Chinese and Japanese people in their common struggle cannot be destroyed by any force. Let us congratulate the further consolidation and development of the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and wish the early realization of long-term peaceful coexistence between socialist China and an independent, democratic, peace-loving, and neutral Japan.
    The topics discussed at this World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Comprehensive Disarmament include: prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons, achieving comprehensive and thorough disarmament, and abolishing all foreign military bases and aggressive military treaties. We believe that the correct resolution of these issues is of great significance for safeguarding world peace. The Chinese people have always opposed the use of nuclear weapons, advocated the peaceful use of atomic energy for the benefit of mankind, and have made sincere and unremitting efforts for this purpose. We fully support the proposal repeatedly put forward by our government that countries along the Asian and Pacific coasts, including the United States, sign a treaty of mutual non-aggression and make this region a nuclear weapon-free zone. This proposal and proposition of our government conform to the common interests and aspirations of all the people in the Asia-Pacific region. We are willing to work together with the people of relevant countries to realize this proposition. However, U.S. imperialism has consistently obstructed the reaching of an agreement on the issue of banning nuclear weapons. U.S. imperialism sets up and expands nuclear weapons military bases everywhere, attempting to drag more countries such as Japan and South Korea into its nuclear war system. U.S. imperialism also occupies our territory of Taiwan, constantly carrying out war provocations against our country. The Chinese people resolutely oppose and sternly condemn the adventurous policy of nuclear war and aggression by U.S. imperialism.
    Disarmament is the common wish and demand of the people of the world and is an important measure to safeguard world peace. Our government and people have always advocated universal disarmament and have made significant efforts to promote disarmament. Our government and people have consistently supported the Soviet government's initiatives and actions on disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons. However, U.S. imperialism stubbornly rejects the Soviet government's repeated proposals for comprehensive and thorough disarmament. U.S. imperialism, after destroying the four-nation government summit, destroyed the ten-nation disarmament conference and frantically carried out arms expansion and war preparations. Representatives of the U.S. ruling clique constantly issue naked war cries, even openly advocating "preemptive" war. Recently, the U.S. Republican and Democratic parties have shamelessly clamored in their election platforms that they will "intensify and bravely carry out" efforts to expand armaments and establish "military forces with deterrent effects." All these facts prove that U.S. imperialism is unwilling to disarm. Only when the people of the world are further united, form a broad united front, and wage unremitting struggle against U.S. imperialism, resolutely smash its policy of aggression and policy of war, is it possible to force U.S. imperialism to seriously consider our disarmament proposals and sit down with us for negotiations on disarmament issues.
    Comrades, friends: The current international situation is very favorable to the struggle of the Japanese people. The national democratic movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism are surging, and the struggles of the people of Western countries, including the American people, against the threat of new wars and in defense of world peace are developing and expanding day by day. Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, said, "The independence and freedom of Japan are very promising." We firmly believe that the Japanese people's struggle to remove U.S. military bases, abolish the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and strive for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, with the strong support of the people of the world, will surely overcome all difficulties, move forward, and achieve the final and complete victory.
    The Chinese people sincerely congratulate the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Comprehensive Disarmament on achieving new and greater success. May the friendly unity of the people of all countries be further strengthened and developed.
    Long live the common cause of the people of the world against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace!

    日本人民为和平事业作出巨大贡献
    中国政府的和平倡议符合亚洲及太平洋地区全体人民的共同利益和愿望  世界人民必须结成广泛统一战线坚决粉碎美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策
    新华社5日讯　廖承志同志在首都各界人民支持“第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会”大会上讲话全文。同志们，朋友们：
    第六届禁止原子弹、氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会，明天就要在日本东京正式开幕。这届大会是在亚洲和世界各国人民反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平运动空前高涨，特别是在英勇的日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的爱国正义斗争取得了重大胜利的大好形势下召开的，它具有非常重要的意义。中国人民热烈欢迎和全力支持第六届禁止原子弹、氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的召开，中国各人民团体已经派出了以中华全国总工会主席刘宁一同志为首的代表团到东京参加大会。我们衷心地预祝大会的成功，预祝大会对日本人民和全世界人民反对使用核武器、反对以美国为首的帝国主义战争侵略势力、保卫世界和平，作出新的更大的贡献。
    大家还记得，十五年前，美国在日本的广岛和长崎投下了原子弹，这使日本人民受到了空前的灾难。日本人民遭受美国氢弹试验的祸害也最多、最大。战后十五年来，日本人民一直站在反对使用核武器斗争的前列，坚持不懈地反对美国军事基地，反对复活日本军国主义和以核武器武装日本，反对美国霸占冲绳岛，反对美日反动派策划新的战争阴谋，为争取日本的独立、民主、和平和中立进行着英勇的斗争。最近两年来，英勇的日本人民更掀起了一浪高过一浪的反对日美军事同盟条约、反对美帝国主义及其代理人的全民性斗争。日本人民在斗争的烈火中结成了越来越广泛越来越坚强的反美爱国统一战线。日本人民在斗争中，觉悟日益提高，团结不断加强，力量迅速壮大。日本人民连续发动的二十二次全国统一行动狠狠地打击了美日反动派。在日本人民的强大斗争和压力下，美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔不得不取消了对日本的访问，美帝国主义在日本的忠实代理人岸信介也不得不下台。日本人民斗争的胜利，严重地打乱了美帝国主义在远东的侵略计划和战争部署，有力地鼓舞了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争，为保卫亚洲和世界和平的事业作出了巨大的贡献。
    日本人民的斗争是世界人民反对美帝国主义，保卫世界和平斗争的一个重要部分，它得到了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界一切爱好和平人民的普遍同情和支持。全世界人民都为日本人民在斗争中取得的成就而欢欣鼓舞。最近，在斯德哥尔摩举行的有五十多个国家代表参加的世界和平理事会常务委员会会议，一致通过决议，支持日本人民反对使用核武器和日美军事同盟条约的斗争，并且指出，“日本人民的这种斗争不仅在日本历史上是空前的，而且也大大鼓舞了世界和平事业和反对侵略的斗争”。日本人民的胜利再一次证明，只要广大的人民群众团结一致，坚持斗争，帝国主义及其走狗的任何阴谋，都是完全能够被击败和被粉碎的。
    中国人民一向坚决支持日本人民要求走独立、民主、和平、中立道路的愿望，坚决支持日本人民反对使用核武器、反对美国军事基地、反对美国霸占冲绳岛、反对日美军事同盟条约的爱国正义斗争。不久之前，当日本人民掀起巨大的反美爱国斗争风暴的时候，中国人民在全国范围内举行了有二千万人参加的集会和示威，展开广泛的群众运动，支持日本人民。日本人民的斗争和他们所取得的胜利，给了中国人民极大的鼓舞和支持。在反对共同的敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，中日两国人民互相支持、互相鼓舞、携手前进，两国人民的友谊得到了进一步的发展。中日两国人民在共同斗争中结成和发展起来的这种友谊，是任何力量破坏不了的。让我们祝贺中日两国人民的友谊更加巩固和发展，并预祝社会主义的中国同独立、民主、和平、中立的日本长期和平共处早日实现。
    这一次禁止原子弹、氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会所讨论的议题有：禁止使用核武器、实现全面彻底裁军、取消一切外国军事基地和侵略性军事条约等有关问题。我们认为这些问题的正确解决，对保卫世界和平有着重要的意义。中国人民一贯反对使用核武器，主张和平利用原子能为人类造福，并为此进行了真诚不懈的努力。我们完全拥护我国政府一再提出的关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国、包括美国在内，签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约，并且使这个地区成为没有核武器地区的建议。我国政府的这个建议和主张是符合亚洲及太平洋地区全体人民的共同利益和愿望的。我们愿意和有关各国人民为实现这个主张而共同努力。但是，美帝国主义却一贯阻挠就禁止核武器问题达成协议。美帝国主义到处设置和扩建核武器军事基地，企图把日本、南朝鲜等更多的国家拉进它的核战争体系中去。美帝国主义还霸占着我国领土台湾，不断地对我国进行战争挑衅。中国人民坚决反对和严厉谴责美帝国主义这种核战争侵略的冒险政策。
    裁军是全世界人民的共同愿望和要求，是维护世界和平的一个重要措施。我国政府和人民一贯主张普遍裁军，并为促进裁军作出了重大的努力。我国政府和人民一贯支持苏联政府关于裁军和禁止核武器的倡议和行动。但是，美帝国主义却顽固地拒绝苏联政府屡次提出的关于全面彻底裁军的建议。美帝国主义在一手破坏了四国政府首脑会议之后，又破坏了十国裁军会议，并且疯狂地进行扩军备战。美国统治集团的代表人物不断地发出露骨的战争叫嚣，甚至公然鼓吹“先发制人”的战争。最近，美国共和党和民主党在它们的竞选纲领中竟然无耻地喧嚷什么要“加紧地、勇敢地进行”扩军努力，要建立“具有威慑作用的军事力量”。所有这些事实都证明美帝国主义是不愿意裁军的。只有全世界人民进一步联合起来，结成广泛的统一战线，同美帝国主义进行不懈的斗争，坚决粉碎它的侵略政策和战争政策，才有可能迫使美帝国主义认真地考虑我们的裁军建议，坐下来同我们进行有关裁军问题的谈判。
    同志们，朋友们：当前的国际形势对日本人民的斗争是非常有利的。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义的民族民主运动汹涌澎湃，西方各国人民，包括美国人民在内的反对新战争威胁、保卫世界和平的斗争正在日益发展和扩大。中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席说过，“日本的独立和自由是很有希望的”。我们深信，日本人民要求撤除美国军事基地、废除日美军事同盟条约，争取独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争，在世界人民的强大支持下，一定能够排除一切困难向前发展，取得最后的、彻底的胜利。
    中国人民衷心祝贺第六届禁止原子弹、氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会获得新的更大的成功。祝各国人民的友好团结进一步加强和发展。
    世界人民反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的共同事业胜利万岁！
