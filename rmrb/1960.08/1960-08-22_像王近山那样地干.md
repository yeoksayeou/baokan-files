    Work Like Wang Jinshan
    Xia Yiyun
    The Wang Jinshan production team is a insulation and painting production team of the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company. This team is diligent and thrifty, and saving is a common practice. On the one hand, they focus on saving every bit, and on the other hand, they focus on material substitution. Painting inevitably drips oil on the ground drop by drop; hardened oil skin on the surface of oil barrels also needs to be scraped off. Many people think these are unusable things, but the workers of the Wang Jinshan team collect these drips and bits of oil and reuse them after boiling. This team uses three to four tons of thick and thin iron wire per month, and sometimes five to six tons. They often don't claim new ones, but use various waste iron wires from the construction site. They use a large amount of straw rope every year, and they use straw rope that comes from bundling firebricks. One insulation project required seven steps according to the design, requiring asbestos tiles and wire mesh, which were not only expensive but also in short supply. Wang Yuebang saw that the blast furnace produced a large amount of slag every day, so he suggested using slag instead of asbestos. Wang Jinshan saw a kind of hollow waste metal plate, so he proposed using this waste material instead of wire mesh. Substitutes were found for each of the seven processes. While ensuring the quality of the project, they used 48 kinds of waste materials, old materials, and substitutes. From January to July this year, they saved a total of more than 400,000 yuan, which is equivalent to not claiming materials for four months.
    What power supports them to do this? It is a far-reaching ideal, great ambition, a high sense of responsibility, and an unshakable sense of ownership. They understand that our country is "poor and blank," but they are not willing to be poor and must use "poor" methods to revolutionize the fate of "poverty" and use "poor" methods to build our great motherland into a prosperous and strong country. They know: "A box of matches costs only one or two cents. If we several people smoke together, we only need one match. If there is a brazier or stove nearby, we don't even need this match. Construction must also be carefully calculated, and we must be as careful as saving every match." Yes, our great motherland has thousands upon thousands of Wang Jinshan production teams, and hundreds of millions of people with the same ideas as the workers of the Wang Jinshan production team, so that we can advance at a rapid pace.
    Chairman Mao wrote in the editor's note to the article "Running the Commune Diligently and Frugally" in the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside": "Run factories diligently and frugally, run shops diligently and frugally, run all state-owned and cooperative undertakings diligently and frugally, and run all other undertakings diligently and frugally. The principle of diligence and frugality should be implemented in everything. This is the principle of saving, and saving is one of the basic principles of socialist economy." Let us follow Chairman Mao's instructions and work like the Wang Jinshan team in every production and construction post!

    像王近山那样地干
    夏逸云
    王近山生产队是北京石景山钢铁公司的一个保温刷油生产队。这个队克勤克俭，节约成风。他们一方面抓点滴节约，一方面抓材料代用。刷油免不了把油一点一滴地掉在地上；成筒的油表面上有硬油皮，也要刮掉。许多人都认为这是不能用的东西，王近山队的工人却把这一滴一点的油回收到一起，熬了以后再用。这个队一个月要用粗细铁丝三、四吨，多的时候要用五、六吨，他们常常不领新的，用的是工地上的各种废铁丝。一年要用大量草绳，他们用的是捆耐火砖来的草绳。有一项保温工程按设计要求是七道工序，要求用石绵瓦和铁丝网，这两种材料不仅价格贵，而且一时供应不足。王跃邦看见高炉每天出产大量的炉渣，他就建议用炉渣代替石绵；王近山看见一种镂空的废金属板，就提议用这种废料代替铁丝网。七道工序每一道都找着了代用品。他们在保证工程质量的情况下，用上了四十八种废料、旧料和代用材料，今年1月到7月，一共节约四十多万元，相当于四个月没有领料。
    是什么力量支持他们这样去干的呢？是远大的理想，伟大的抱负，高度的责任感，不可动摇的主人翁思想。他们懂得我们国家是“一穷二白”的，但是并不甘心穷下去，一定要用“穷”办法来革“穷”字的命，要用“穷”办法把我们伟大的祖国建设成一个繁荣富强的国家。他们知道：“一盒火柴才一两分钱，咱们如果是几个人一起抽烟，就只用一根火柴，要是旁边有火盆或者炉子，连这根火柴也不用了。搞建设也得精打细算，要像节约每一根火柴一样精打细算。”是的，我们伟大祖国正是有着千千万万个王近山生产队，有着亿万个具有王近山生产队工人们同样思想的人，我们才能一日千里地飞速前进。
    毛主席在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书《勤俭办社》一文的按语中写道：“勤俭办工厂，勤俭办商店，勤俭办一切国营事业和合作事业，勤俭办一切其他事业，什么事情都应当执行勤俭的原则。这就是节约的原则，节约是社会主义经济的基本原则之一。”让我们遵循毛主席这一指示，在各个生产和建设的岗位上，都像王近山队那样地干！
