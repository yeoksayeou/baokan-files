    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 21st: Seoul dispatch: The struggle of teachers in various parts of South Korea against the puppet authorities' suppression of teachers' union organizations, which began on the 11th, is expanding daily. On August 20th, the day after the U.S. imperialists put their lackey Chang Myon in the seat of "Prime Minister," a demonstration involving more than 5,000 teachers broke out in Daegu.

    According to a report by the Toyo News Agency, at 11:30 a.m. on that day, more than 5,000 teachers marched from Dalseong Park in Daegu. The demonstrators demanded that the Gyeongsangbuk-do puppet authorities immediately withdraw the personnel measures that dispersed union cadres to various locations, a reactionary personnel move designed to undermine the teachers' union from within. The demonstration passed in front of the Gyeongsangbuk-do puppet government and the Daegu city puppet government.

    According to reports, before the demonstration, the demonstrators held a "Gyeongsangbuk-do Teachers' Union Members' General Uprising Rally Against Suppression of Teachers" inside Dalseong Park. Representatives from the teachers' union federations from various places, including Seoul, and representatives from the Railway Workers' Union League, the Maritime Affairs Office Union, and the Monopoly Bureau Union also participated in the meeting.

    The participants in the meeting angrily condemned the puppet authorities' repressive measures against teachers and passed a resolution: if the puppet authorities still do not withdraw their measures to persecute the union by August 25, all teachers in Gyeongsangbuk-do and all teachers in South Korea will resign en masse.

    According to a report by the Hapdong News Agency, on the afternoon of the 18th, more than 200 teachers in Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk-do, gathered at the "Central National School" and held a demonstration against the puppet authorities' suppression of the teachers' union. They held banners and shouted slogans, demanding the "withdrawal of improper personnel measures."

    坚决反对傀儡当局破坏教员工会
    大丘五千多名教员示威
    决定如当局不停止迫害将和全体南朝鲜教员总辞职
    新华社平壤21日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜各地教员从11日展开的反对傀儡当局镇压教员工会组织的斗争日益扩大，就在美帝国主义把它的走狗张勉扶上了“总理”座位的第二天，8月20日在大丘爆发了有五千多名教员参加的示威。
    据东洋通讯社报道，这一天上午十一点三十分，五千多名教员从大丘市内的达城公园出发举行示威。示威群众要求庆尚北道傀儡当局立即撤回把工会的干部分散到各地的人事措施，这项反动的人事措施是为了从内部破坏教员工会。示威的行列由庆尚北道傀儡政府和大丘市傀儡政府前面通过。
    据报道，在举行示威前示威群众在达城公园内举行了“庆尚北道教员工会会员反对镇压教员总奋起大会”。参加大会的还有从汉城等各地赶来的各地的教员工会联合会的代表和铁道工会联盟、海务厅工会、专卖厅工会的代表。
    大会参加者愤怒地谴责了傀儡当局对教员的镇压措施，并通过决议：如到8月25日傀儡当局仍不收回它迫害工会的措施，庆尚北道全道的教员和南朝鲜的全体教员将要总辞职。
    据合同通讯社报道，18日下午庆尚北道浦项市内二百多名教员曾在“中央国民学校”集结，举行了反对傀儡当局镇压教员工会的示威，他们拿着标语，喊着口号，要求“撤回不正当的人事措施”。
