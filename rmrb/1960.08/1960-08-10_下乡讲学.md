    Giving Lectures in the Countryside	Liang Deming, Deputy Director of Pediatrics, Wuhan Fourth Hospital
    I took an early morning long-distance bus from the city to the Huangpi County Health Center to give lectures, and I was unusually excited along the way. Although the buildings of the health center were relatively simple, they were plain and generous, clean and quiet. Rows of vegetables were planted around the center, emitting a lush green glow under the sunlight.

    After resting for a while, I used the morning to make rounds with them. There were not many sick children in the pediatric ward here, and the ward was clean and tidy. At this time, it was the season for the prevalence of toxic indigestion and toxic dysentery, so I gave a detailed explanation of the diagnosis, treatment, and rescue methods for the above two diseases. The doctors and nurses were listening attentively, and I became more and more enthusiastic as I spoke. After I finished speaking, the doctors and nurses raised many questions. Only then did I realize that what I was talking about was a completely foreign set of methods, requiring the cooperation of a well-equipped laboratory and the use of various expensive drugs, which was completely divorced from reality in the countryside. I thought, can't the countryside treat diseases without my set of methods? Didn't the doctor say during the ward rounds that their cure rate was very high? What is the reason for this? I was very distressed. So I went to talk to the doctor again. The rural doctor was very simple and honest in his conversation. Of course, he felt that what I said was very novel and considered it new knowledge that was very helpful to him. However, in the conversation, I learned that he not only had general medical knowledge, but also rich experience in traditional Chinese medicine. He made full use of folk remedies, acupuncture, massage, and a combination of Chinese and Western medicine to cure many critical and serious illnesses. At this time, I was very moved and discovered that I had a serious shortcoming of not being able to combine theory with practice.

    Night was gradually falling, and the sky was dotted with brilliant stars. The lecture began. The audience included old doctors, young apprentices, rural self-trained midwives, and health workers. Some of them walked from the management area health sub-centers more than forty miles away to listen to the lecture. After listening to the lecture, they slept in the classroom, and had to rush back before dawn. I tried my best to finish the two-hour lecture in a popular, simple, and practical way. They were all listening attentively and taking notes. They were humble and sincere, asked many questions, and also introduced their experiences. Everyone's feelings were blended together.

    The Party branch decided to send me to the health centers of various communes and management areas early tomorrow morning to provide technical guidance. This was a very rare opportunity for me. I visited two commune health centers and two management area health sub-centers. The doctors were all practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine, but they had initially mastered general Western medical knowledge. They made full use of the experience of traditional Chinese medicine and used a combination of Chinese and Western medicine to treat many difficult diseases, especially in eliminating pests and diseases and focusing on prevention, making great contributions to ensuring the health of the broad masses of rural working people. Nurseries and kindergartens were well-organized, and cleanliness and hygiene were also well maintained.

    This trip to the countryside to give lectures gave me the most profound practical education.

    下乡讲学	武汉市第四医院小儿科副主任　梁德明
    我乘着早班的长途汽车，从市内出发到黄陂县卫生院去讲学，一路上异常兴奋。卫生院的建筑物虽然比较简陋，但朴素大方，清洁而安静，院的周围还种上了一行行的蔬菜，在阳光照耀下放出绿油油的光彩。
    我休息了一会，就利用上午时间和他们一起去查房。这里的儿科病房病孩子并不多，病房里清洁、干净。此时已是中毒性消化不良和中毒性痢疾流行的季节，我就把上述两种疾病的诊断、治疗、抢救等疗法作了比较详细的讲解，医生护士们都在认真的听讲，我也就越讲越起劲。讲完后，医生、护士们提出很多问题。这时我才发现我讲的完全是一套洋的，要有设备相当完善的化验室去配合，要使用各种贵重药品，这在农村来说，是完全脱离实际的。我想，难道农村脱离我这一套就不能治病吗？查房时医生不是说他们的治愈率很高吗？这是什么道理呢？我很苦恼。于是我又去找医生谈。农村医生谈话非常朴实，他对我所讲的当然觉得非常新颖，认为是新的知识，对他帮助很大。但是在谈话中我了解到他不但具有一般医疗法的知识，而且有丰富的祖国医学经验。他充分利用了民间单方、针灸、推拿和中西结合的方法，治好了不少危急严重疾病。这时使我非常感动，发现自己存在着理论不能结合实际的严重缺点。
    夜幕已渐渐下降，天上点缀着灿烂的繁星，讲学开始了。听讲的人有老医生，年青的学徒，农村自己训练的助产士和保健员等。他们有的从四十几里外管理区卫生分院徒步跑来听讲。听讲后就睡在课堂里，天未亮又得赶回去。我尽量用通俗浅显而易于结合实际的方式讲完了两小时的课，他们都是全神贯注地听讲、做笔记。他们谦虚诚恳，提了不少问题，并且还介绍了他们的经验，大家的感情汇合在一起。
    党支部决定明天一早叫我到各公社及管理区卫生院去进行技术指导。这对我来说是非常难得的机会，我一共走了两个公社卫生院和两个管理区卫生分院。医生都是中医，但已初步掌握了一般西医的知识。他们充分利用了祖国医学的经验，使用中西结合的方法，治疗了很多疑难的疾病，特别是在除害灭病，预防为主方面作出了很大的贡献，保障了广大农村劳动人民的身体健康。托儿所、幼儿园井井有条，清洁卫生亦搞得很好。
    这次下乡讲学，却给了我一次最深刻的实际教育。
