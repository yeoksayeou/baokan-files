    Greeting Miners' Day
    Soviet Coal Miners Strive for Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 27th: Soviet coal miners are mining more coal for the country to greet this year's Miners' Day (August 28th). According to recent reports in the local press, in the first six months of this year, they overfulfilled the state plan by 4.97 million tons of coal, which is 670,000 tons more than the total amount of coal overfulfilled in the entire last year. In the first half of this year, the miners' labor productivity increased by 6.2% compared to the same period last year, setting the highest record for labor productivity growth in the last decade.
    The widespread adoption of cyclical organization of work methods in various mines, further realization of production mechanization and automation, and the active launching of labor competitions are important reasons for the accelerated growth of production and labor productivity in the Soviet coal mining industry since the beginning of this year. For example, in the coal mining enterprises of the Lugansk Economic Zone, 90% of the coal mining faces are now implementing cyclical organization of work methods (38% in 1958), which resulted in an average increase of 26% in the coal output per coal mining face and a 10% increase in labor productivity.

    迎接矿工节
    苏联煤矿工人努力生产
    据新华社莫斯科27日电　苏联煤矿工人正在为国家开采更多的煤，以迎接今年的矿工节（8月28日）。据此间报刊最近报道，在今年头六个月中，他们为国家超计划开采了四百九十七万吨煤，即比去年全年超计划开采的煤的总量还多六十七万吨。在今年上半年，矿工的劳动生产率比去年同期提高了6.2％，创造了最近十年中劳动生产率增长速度的最高纪录。
    在各地矿井中广泛采用循环组织工作法，进一步实现生产机械化和自动化，积极展开劳动竞赛，这是今年以来苏联采煤工业生产和劳动生产率增长加快的重要原因。例如，在卢干斯克经济区的煤矿企业中，现在90％的采煤场子都实行循环组织工作法（1958年为38％），结果就使每个采煤场子的采煤量平均增加了26％，劳动生产率提高了10％。
