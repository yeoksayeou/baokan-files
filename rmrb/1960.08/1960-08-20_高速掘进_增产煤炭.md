    High-Speed Tunneling Increases Coal Production
    After reading the People’s Daily editorial “Immediately Launch an Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement Centered on Grain and Steel,” the workers of our coal heading team were greatly encouraged. We immediately held a meeting to review our work for the first seven months of this year and studied the plan for increasing production and practicing economy for the next four months. Our average monthly tunneling footage for the first seven and a half months reached 929 meters. To produce more coal and ensure the continued leap forward in steel production, we will work even harder in the next four months, advance victoriously, and further improve tunneling efficiency. At the same time, we must do everything possible to save timber, explosives, and other raw materials, and ensure safe production.

    Our measures to achieve these goals are: First, earnestly study Chairman Mao's works and arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought; Second, give full play to the fighting role of the core groups in each shift, vigorously launch small group "production sports meets," carry out competition between shifts and between individuals, strengthen unity in the competition, and improve cooperation, with each shift creating favorable conditions for each other; Third, continue to vigorously engage in technological revolution and promote advanced experiences; Fourth, strengthen production management, carefully study production plans and specific measures at each pre-shift meeting, earnestly summarize experiences at post-shift meetings, and adopt methods such as contracting for safety, quality, and tasks, to ensure that the plan is implemented for everyone, so that everyone is clear about the monthly, daily, and shift production plans and has clear goals; Fifth, improve sanitation, exercise, and ensure an attendance rate of over 96%.

    高速掘进　增产煤炭
    我们煤巷掘进小组的工人读了人民日报“立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动”的社论以后，大家心情十分振奋。我们立刻开会检查了今年前七个多月的工作，研究了今后四个多月的增产节约计划。我们前七个半月的平均掘进月进尺都达到九百二十九米。为了增产更多的煤，保证钢铁生产持续跃进，我们要在今后四个多月鼓足更大的干劲，乘胜前进，进一步提高掘进效率，同时，要千方百计节约坑木、火药等原材料，保证安全生产。
    我们实现这些打算的措施是：一，认真学习毛主席著作，用毛主席的思想武装自己的头脑；二，充分发挥每班核心组的战斗作用，大搞小组“生产运动会”，开展班与班、人与人之间的竞赛，并在竞赛中加强团结，搞好协作，各班要互相创造有利条件；三，继续大闹技术革命，推广先进经验；四，加强生产管理，每次班前会上都认真研究生产计划、具体措施，收工会上认真总结经验，并采取包安全、包质量、包任务等方法，把计划落实到每个人身上，做到每月、每日、每班的生产计划，人人心中有数，目标明确；五，搞好卫生，锻炼身体，保证出勤率达到96％以上。
