    Sow Pregnancy Requires Grasping Two Ends, Piglets Pass Through Three Gates
    Sheng Jinlong Finds the Pattern for Raising Good Piglets
    Seven Years of Raising Pigs, More Than Two Thousand Three Hundred Head, Every Single One Survived, Every One Healthy
    (Our Dispatch) Sheng Jinlong, a pig raising expert from Zhujing People's Commune in Jinshan County, Shanghai, has constantly absorbed positive and negative experiences from his long-term pig raising work and has explored a pattern for raising piglets, thus achieving seven years without a single pig dying.
    Sheng Jinlong has worked in three pig farms since he formed a mutual aid team in 1953. The pigs in these three pig farms were not raised well originally. Especially the piglets from birth to weaning are more likely to die due to their weak constitution. It was considered normal for three to five piglets to die in each litter. However, Sheng Jinlong broke this convention with his created pig raising achievements. He has raised more than 2,300 pigs in the past seven years without a single death. He said heroically: "There are no pigs that cannot be raised well, only people who cannot raise pigs well."
      Sow Pregnancy Requires Grasping Two Ends  Piglets Pass Through Three Gates
    "Grasp the two ends well, pass the three gates well," and the piglets can grow strong. This is the growth pattern of piglets that Sheng Jinlong has discovered.
    There is a farmers' saying in Zhujing Commune, "Good seedlings yield good rice, good seedlings yield good rice." Sheng Jinlong was inspired by this saying: To raise piglets well, one must start from cultivating fetal pigs. Sheng Jinlong found from long-term practice that the first month of pregnancy is when the fetal pigs are just forming; the last month of pregnancy is when the fetal pigs develop the fastest. These two periods are crucial. The so-called "grasping the two ends" means that these two crucial periods require particularly careful feeding and management. In the early stages of sow pregnancy, feed more refined feed rich in protein, and avoid feeding sour and raw food to prevent the sow from being stimulated and having a miscarriage. In the later stages of pregnancy, in addition to increasing the refined feed to fully ensure the nutritional needs of the fetal pigs and the sow itself, it is also necessary to strengthen the work of protecting the fetus. Grasping these two ends well, the piglets will have a good congenital foundation, which will lay a solid foundation for raising the piglets well.
    "Piglets pass through three gates at birth," This is another important experience for Sheng Jinlong to raise piglets well. Some people say, "Raising pigs is easy, but producing piglets is difficult." Where is the difficulty? Because piglets are most likely to die when they are born. Piglets that have just landed are often hidden in the grass and are easily trampled or crushed to death by the sow; in cold weather, they are easily frozen to death; if the pigsty is damp and dirty, they are easily die from illness. This is the first hurdle for piglets to survive – the "birth gate." In order to pass this hurdle well, whenever a sow gives birth, Sheng Jinlong stays by the sow's side, meticulously doing the work of delivery, just like an obstetrician attending to a parturient. Before giving birth, use short rice straw to pad the grass nest for the sow; when giving birth, pick up one piglet as the sow gives birth, wipe the piglet dry with dry grass or a piece of cloth, remove the dirt from the piglet's mouth, and cut the piglet's umbilical cord. In cold weather, also put the piglet into the prepared warm nest, and then hold it to the sow for breastfeeding.
    The ten days or so after the piglets are born is another hurdle for the piglets to survive – the "ten-day gate." According to Sheng Jinlong's experience, within ten days after the piglets are born, it must be ensured that every piglet is full of milk. At this time, Sheng Jinlong feeds the sow more refined feed so that the sow always has enough milk to supply the piglets. Sheng Jinlong discovered from long-term exploration that the sow's milk in the front chest is generally more abundant and thicker, while the milk from the teats in the abdomen is less and thinner. Among a litter of piglets, there are often one or two particularly weak piglets that cannot get enough milk because they are too weak. For this kind of lagging piglet, Sheng Jinlong often holds it to breastfeed; after feeding it several times, the piglet gets used to it and fixes the teat. Some sows produce too many piglets, and there is not enough milk. Sheng Jinlong also finds "nannies" for the piglets who are not full, that is, puts these piglets into the nests of sows who have fewer piglets to breastfeed. In this way, all the piglets are full, develop well, and every piglet passes the "ten-day gate."
    As the piglets gradually grow up, the amount of milk from the sow becomes less and less. At this time, they encounter the third gate – the "ten-jin gate." At this time, the piglets often look for food everywhere because they are not full, from the leftovers in the sow's feeding trough, the rice straw in the bedding, to the sow's feces and urine. After eating these things, they suffer from white dysentery due to indigestion, which often causes batches of piglets to die. Sheng Jinlong's solution to this problem is to "start feeding early" to the piglets. Generally, ten to fifteen days after the piglets are born, start feeding a small amount of specially made refined feed, such as sweet potato flour paste and tofu pulp; then gradually change from refined to coarse, from less to more. Therefore, it effectively prevents the white dysentery of piglets, so that the piglets quickly grow to ten pounds. Once past the "ten-jin gate", the piglets' resistance is enhanced and they are easier to raise. Early feeding can lead to early weaning, and early weaning can lead to early meat growth. The piglets raised by Sheng Jinlong are generally weaned forty days after birth, and grow to twenty-five to thirty pounds in two months, which is faster than the piglets raised by ordinary breeders.
        Find Patterns From Positive and Negative Experiences
    The reason why Sheng Jinlong was able to discover the pattern of "grasping the two ends and passing the three gates" is that he is good at accepting positive and negative experiences in his long-term pig raising work, and conducts thorough and meticulous research.
    In the past, Sheng Jinlong's uncle, Sheng Qiyun, was a pig raising expert. Sheng Jinlong often paid attention to studying Sheng Qiyun's pig raising methods and found that he was very particular about feeding management. For example, pig feed is made with a combination of coarse and fine grains, the feed must be cooked before feeding, the feeding trough is often brushed, the pigsty bedding is often replaced with new ones, and it is also dried in the sun in cold weather. With good sanitation, pigs rarely get sick. When a sow gives birth, even on a cold winter night, he stays by the pigsty to help the sow give birth. Sheng Jinlong watched these good methods, kept them in mind, and specifically applied them to his own pig raising work. Once, the sow raised by his neighbor Wang Yongfa gave birth to stillborn piglets. Stillbirths are common, but never to the point where every single one dies. Sheng Jinlong went to Wang Yongfa's pig shed to find out the reason. He learned an important lesson from this: putting the feeding trough in the middle of the sow's pen means that the sow's abdomen often bumps into the stone trough when she walks, which will damage the fetal pigs.
    In 1958, when he went to work at the No. 2 Pig Farm in Guangming Team 1 of Zhujing Commune, he found a circle of thirty-three weaned piglets in the shed, some big, some small, some fat, some thin, uneven. Why is this so? He repeatedly and carefully observed and found the reason from the pigs' eating habits. It turned out that these many piglets were eating in a large feeding trough. The ones with more strength ate more, and as a result, they became fat faster; the ones with less strength could not squeeze in and could only eat some leftovers, which led to malnutrition, so they became very thin. Sheng Jinlong also learned from this: piglets of different sizes cannot eat "from the same pot." He came up with a graded feeding method, dividing the thirty-three piglets into three circles according to their size and feeding them separately, and quickly fattened all three circles of pigs.
        Critically Accept Old Experiences, Constantly Create New Experiences
    Sheng Jinlong's attitude towards old experiences is to believe them but not blindly believe them. He believes in whatever has been proven effective through practice, and he does not believe in whatever is ineffective. This attitude of critically accepting historical experience has enabled him to further correctly grasp and develop the pig raising experience accumulated among the local farmers. According to old experience, farmers in Zhujing Commune believe that thin sows are better. They say: Thin sows produce more piglets, and fat sows are prone to miscarriage. Sheng Jinlong found from practice that this statement is not entirely correct. Because although thin sows produce more piglets, the piglets produced by thin sows are also thin. In order to gain experience, he personally tried to raise a fat sow, but the sow experienced dystocia during childbirth and almost could not give birth to the piglets. Through comparative experiments and analysis, he put forward a creative view: it is most appropriate for the sow to be neither fat nor thin, but to maintain eight percent fatness.
    Sheng Jinlong is not satisfied with learning from other people's experiences. He also starts from reality and explores new experiences and new rules meticulously and practically from his long-term pig raising practice. He studied the reasons for the piglets' calls from the piglets' calls, and found out the rules of the piglets' calls and the different calls represent different requirements. For example: the harsh sound of "squeak, squeak" means that the piglet is being stepped on by the sow; "woo, woo" is the cry for help from the piglet when its whole body is pressed by the sow; many piglets cry like cicadas on the trees in summer, indicating that the piglets are hungry. In the past, when piglets were weaned, he always left the sow in the original circle and moved the piglets to another pigsty. As a result, every time the piglets would cry all night, and the next day they would generally lose weight. After careful analysis, he mastered the piglets' habit of being afraid of strangers. Later, he changed his approach, letting the sow move to another circle and leaving the piglets in the original circle, so that they were safe and sound.
    It is in this way that Sheng Jinlong has been constantly accepting experiences from all aspects - positive, negative, successful, and failed - and carefully studying them in his work. He finally discovered the pattern of raising piglets of "grasping the two ends and passing the three gates" and created the miracle of not losing a single pig in seven years!
      Seven Years Without Losing a Pig: Red Heart, Skillful Hands Create Miracle
    How did Sheng Jinlong become a pig farm feeder? There is a moving story behind this: Seven years ago, the mutual aid team led by Sheng Jinlong was rated as a model mutual aid team in the county due to the bumper harvest of rice, and he himself was also rated as a county agricultural labor model. In 1955, when it was still a junior cooperative, the cooperative set up the first collective pig farm, raising thirty-two pigs. The feeder was a young man of eighteen or nineteen years old, lacking pig raising experience. After raising them for a few months, two pigs died, and he refused to do it no matter what. Other members of the commune were also unwilling to raise pigs, some because they thought it was dirty, and some because they said pigs were not easy to raise. At this time, Sheng Jinlong stepped forward and volunteered to raise pigs. Many people asked him: "Why are you giving up being a labor model to raise pigs?" Sheng Jinlong replied: "These are the collective's pigs! If no one takes care of them and the pigs die, doesn't everyone have a share in it?"
    Since they are the collective's pigs, we cannot let a single one die! What Sheng Jinlong considered was not personal fame and gain, but the interests of the collective. Under the leadership and care of the Party, and with Sheng Jinlong's careful cultivation, the pigs were raised alive and well, and the sapling of the collective pig farm grew and thrived.
  Since the municipal party committee put forward the call to realize "one pig per mu of land," he has a deeper understanding of the important significance of rapidly developing pig raising. He said: "Raising one more pig is equivalent to planting one more mu of land; if one pig dies, it is equivalent to abandoning one mu of land." Therefore, he can wholeheartedly do a good job in pig raising, and do everything possible to raise and strengthen every big pig and piglet. With a red heart, one can have skillful hands. It is precisely because he has such a noble idea of serving the people and a soaring drive, as well as a solid and meticulous work style, that he can explore and master the laws of piglet growth.
    It is by no means accidental that Sheng Jinlong has achieved seven years without losing a single pig. (Attached pictures)

    母猪怀孕抓两头　小猪出生过三关
    盛进龙找到养好小猪的规律
    七年养猪二千三百多头，只只成活，头头健壮
    本报讯　上海市金山县朱泾人民公社养猪能手盛进龙，从长期的养猪工作实践中，不断吸取正面经验和反面经验，摸索出一条养小猪的规律，从而做到七年不死一头猪。
    盛进龙从1953年成立互助组起，先后在三个养猪场工作过。这三个养猪场原来猪都养得不好，特别是从出生到断奶期间的小猪，由于体质弱，更容易死亡。每一窝小猪，死亡三、五头被认为是正常的现象。可是，盛进龙以自己创造的养猪成绩打破了这个常规，七年来他共养猪二千三百多头，没有死过一头。他豪迈地说：“没有养不好的猪，只有养不好猪的人。”
      母猪怀孕抓两头  小猪出生过三关
    “抓好两头，过好三关”，小猪就能成长壮大。这是盛进龙摸到的小猪的生长规律。
    朱泾公社有一句农谚“种好苗好，苗好稻好”。盛进龙从这句农谚得到启示：要养好小猪，必须从培育胎猪开始。盛进龙从长期实践中发现：母猪怀孕以后的第一个月，胎猪刚刚形成；怀孕的最后一个月，胎猪发育最快。这两个时期都是关键时期，所谓“抓两头”，就是在这两个关键时期，需要特别精心饲养管理。在母猪怀孕初期，要多喂含蛋白质丰富的精饲料，忌喂酸食和生食，以防母猪受到刺激而发生流产。怀孕后期，除了增喂精饲料，充分保证胎猪和母猪本身的营养需要以外，还要加强保胎工作。抓好这两头，小猪先天足，就为养好小猪打下了牢固的基础。
    “小猪出生过三关”，这是盛进龙养好小猪的又一条重要经验。有人说，“养猪容易产仔难”。难在哪里呢？因为产仔时，小猪最容易死亡，刚落地的小猪往往藏在草内易被母猪踏死、压死；冷天，容易冻死；猪圈潮湿、肮脏，又容易病死。这就是小猪成活的第一道关口——“出生关”。为了过好这一道关口，每逢母猪产仔时，盛进龙就守在母猪身旁，像助产士侍候产妇一样，细致地做接生工作。在产仔前，为母猪用短稻草垫好草窝；在产仔时，母猪生一头，收拾一头，用干草或布片把小猪全身揩干，挖去小猪口中的污物，给小猪剪脐带。冷天，并将小猪放入早已准备好了的暖窝，然后捧到母猪身边喂奶。
    小猪出生以后的十天左右，是小猪成活的又一关——“十天关”。根据盛进龙的经验，在小猪出生后的十天内，必须保证每一头小猪都吃饱奶。这时，盛进龙多给母猪喂一些精饲料，使母猪经常有充足的奶水供给小猪。盛进龙从长期摸索中发现，母猪一般前胸的奶水又多又浓，腹部奶头的奶水又少又淡。一窝小猪当中，常常有一、二头身体特别瘦弱的落脚猪，因为力气小，常常抢不到奶吃。对于这种落脚猪，盛进龙往往捧了去喂奶；喂上几次，小猪习惯了，就固定了奶头。有的母猪生产的小猪过多，奶水不够，盛进龙还为吃不饱的小猪找“保姆”，即把这些小猪放到产仔少的母猪窝里去喂奶。这样，全窝小猪都吃饱奶，发育得好，头头小猪都闯过“十天关”。
    小猪逐渐长大以后，母猪奶水的数量愈来愈少，这时又遇到第三关——“十斤关”。这时候，小猪由于吃不饱，常常到处寻食，从母猪食槽中的残羹剩食、垫圈的稻草，直到母猪的屎尿都吃，吃了，便因消化不良而生白痢病，常常造成小猪成批的死亡。盛进龙解决这个问题的办法，是给小猪“早开食”。一般小猪出生十天到十五天，就开始喂少量特制的精饲料，例如山芋粉糊和豆腐浆；以后逐渐由精到粗，由少到多。因此，有效地防止了小猪白痢病，使小猪很快地长到十斤重。一过“十斤关”，小猪抵抗力增强了，就容易养活了。早开食就能早断奶，早断奶就能早长肉。盛进龙养的小猪，一般出生四十天断奶，二个月就长到二十五斤到三十斤重，比一般饲养员养的小猪长得快。
        从正面和反面   经验中找规律
    盛进龙所以能摸索到“抓两头，过三关”的规律，是他在长期的养猪工作中善于接受正面经验和反面经验，并且踏实地、细致地进行研究的结果。
    过去，盛进龙的伯父盛其云就是一个养猪能手。盛进龙常常留心研究盛其云的养猪方法，发现他非常讲究饲养管理。例如，喂猪饲料都经过粗细搭配，饲料一定煮熟以后才喂，食槽常常刷洗，猪圈垫草常常换新，冷天还要整晒。清洁工作做得好，猪就很少生病。遇到母猪产仔，即是寒冷的冬夜，他也守候在猪圈旁边，帮助母猪接生。盛进龙把这些好办法看在眼里，记在心里，并具体地运用到自己的养猪工作中去。有一次，他的邻居王永发养的母猪，生下来的小猪全是死胎。死胎也常见，从来没有死得一头不剩的。盛进龙特地到王永发的猪棚里去找原因。他从这里吸取了一条重要的教训：把食槽放在母猪圈的当中，母猪走路时腹部经常碰上石槽，胎猪就会碰坏。
    1958年他到朱泾公社光明一队第二养猪场去工作，发现棚内有一圈三十三头断奶小猪，大的大，小的小，肥的肥，瘦的瘦，参差不齐。为什么会这样？他反复细心观察，从猪吃食当中找出了原因，原来这许多小猪在一个大食槽中吃食，力气大的吃得多，结果肥得快；力气小的挤不上，只能吃些下脚残渣，营养不良，所以瘦得很。盛进龙从这里又得出一条经验：不能让体格大小不一的小猪在一起吃“大锅饭”。他想出一个分等饲养方法，把三十三头小猪按照体型大小，分在三个圈内饲养，很快就把这三圈猪都养肥了。
    批判接受老经验  不断创造新经验
    盛进龙对待老经验，采取又相信但又不迷信的态度。凡是通过实践证明有效的就相信，无效的就不相信。这种批判地接受历史经验的态度，使他进一步正确地掌握并发展了当地农民中积累的养猪经验。朱泾公社的农民根据老经验，认为母猪瘦的好。他们说：瘦母猪产仔多，母猪肥了要流产。盛进龙从实践中发现这个说法不完全对。因为瘦母猪固然产仔多，但瘦母猪产的小猪也瘦。为了求取经验，他亲自试养了一头肥母猪，但母猪产仔时发生了难产，几乎产不下小猪来。通过对比试验和分析，他提出一个创造性的见解：母猪不肥不瘦，保持八成膘最适当。
    盛进龙并不满足于学习旁人的经验，还从实际出发，从长期的养猪实践中，踏踏实实、细细致致地探索新的经验、新的规律。他从小猪的叫声中研究小猪叫的原因，找出了小猪叫的规律和不同的叫声表示不同的要求，比如：“吱吱，吱吱”的刺耳的声音，是小猪被母猪踩住了；“呜呜，呜呜”，是小猪整个身体被母猪压住而发出的求救声；许多小猪像夏天树上的蝉鸣，说明小猪饿了。过去，小猪断奶时，他总是让母猪留在原圈，把小猪搬往另一个猪圈，结果每次小猪都要整整地叫一夜，第二天普遍跌膘。经过细心分析，他掌握了小猪怕生的习性。以后他改变了做法，让母猪搬到别的圈里，小猪留在原圈，这样就安然无事了。
    盛进龙就是这样不断接受各方面的经验——正面的，反面的；成功的，失败的，并在工作中细心地研究，终于摸到了“抓两头，过三关”的养小猪规律，创造了七年不死一头猪的奇迹！
      七年不死一头猪   心红手巧创奇迹
    盛进龙是怎样当了猪场饲养员的？这里边还有一段动人的故事：七年以前，盛进龙所领导的互助组由于水稻丰收被评为县的模范互助组，他自己也被评为县农业劳动模范。1955年，还是初级合作社的时候，社里办了第一个集体养猪场，养了三十二头猪。饲养员是个十八九岁的年轻小伙子，缺少养猪经验，养了几个月，死了两头猪，他无论如何再也不肯干了。别的社员也都不肯去养猪，有的嫌脏，有的说猪不好养。就在这时，盛进龙挺身出来要去养猪。许多人问他：“你放着劳动模范不当，去养猪，这是为的啥？”盛进龙回答道：“这是集体的猪呀！如果没人管，死了猪，不是大家都有份吗？”
    是集体的猪，就不能让它死掉一头！盛进龙所考虑的不是个人名利，而是集体的利益。在党的领导和关怀下，在盛进龙的精心培育下，猪养活了，养好了，集体养猪场这棵幼苗成长、茁壮了。
  自从市委提出了实现“一亩地一头猪”的号召以后，他对迅速发展养猪业的重要意义体会得更加深刻，他说：“我们多养一头猪，就等于多种一亩地；如果死了一头猪，就等于荒了一亩地。”所以，他能全心全意地做好养猪工作，千方百计养活、养壮每一头大猪和小猪。心红就能手巧。正因为他有了这样为人民服务的崇高思想和冲天的干劲，踏踏实实、细细致致的工作作风，才能摸索并掌握小猪生长的规律。
    盛进龙做到七年不死一头猪，绝不是偶然的事情。（附图片）
