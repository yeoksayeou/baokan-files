Uncovering the Secrets of Life with "Tracers"
	Wang Yongchao

	There are numerous types of animals in nature, each with its own distinct characteristics. Understanding their living habits, reproduction, migration, and distribution is indeed not an easy task. People are already familiar with many kinds of migratory birds that fly south in flocks when the cool autumn arrives, and return to their northern homeland when the bright spring season comes. Many kinds of fish suddenly appear in groups only during certain seasons. People cannot help but wonder: Where do these tireless "travelers" go to avoid the harsh winter? What routes do they take? In the vast and boundless ocean, where do they come from? And where do they go? Where do they breed their offspring? Initially, no one could answer these questions definitively. Later, biologists cleverly used the "tracer" method and successfully solved this problem. That is, they put a metal ring on the legs of birds or mark the bodies of fish, and then release them back into their natural environment. In the future, when these animals are captured in different places, we can identify them from among thousands of companions, and thus they act as "tracers." From the behavior of a few of these animals, the movement of their entire family can be determined. For example, it was determined that eels swim from the rivers of Europe and America to the Sargasso Sea, where they lay their eggs and die. Several years later, the baby eels grow up, and they repeat the path of their ancestors, swimming to the rivers of Western Europe and America.

	With the development of science, this ancient marking method has obviously become very backward. Just like "metabolism" is the biggest secret of life, after a person eats food, what components does it become in the body? How are these components broken down and transformed? If we could mark the atoms or molecules in the food components, then no matter what they transform into in the future, we could recognize them. However, atoms are very small particles, invisible even under a microscope, and the old marking method is obviously powerless. It was not until 1934, when the Joliot-Curies discovered the artificial method of producing radioactive isotopes, that human fantasy finally became a reality.

	An isotope is an atom with the same atomic number but a different mass number. For example, phosphorus has an atomic number of 15, and due to different mass numbers, there are several types such as phosphorus-30, phosphorus-31, and phosphorus-32. Among them, phosphorus-32 is a radioactive isotope. It has no distinguishable chemical properties from other phosphorus atoms. The only marker is that it can emit radiation. This radiation is invisible and intangible to humans, but we can use special detection instruments to find its traces and measure its numbers.

	Using the "tracer atom" method to mark the carbon atoms on the fatty acids that make up fat as radioactive carbon, after the animal eats it, it is found that there is also radioactivity on the glucose in the body, indicating that fat can be converted into sugar in the body. The same method clarifies that sugars, fats, and proteins in the body can be converted into each other.

	The application of "tracer atoms" in medicine is very broad. Doctors use the characteristic that brain tumors strongly absorb diiodofluorescein dye. They inject diiodofluorescein containing radioactive iodine into the patient's body, and use a detector to find the location of the brain tumor, which is convenient for accurate craniotomy.

	The application of tracer atoms has corrected some past misconceptions. For example, eggshells contain calcium. In the past, people thought that calcium entered the blood from food, and then entered the eggshell from the blood. Research using radioactive calcium shows that all the calcium in food enters the bones instead of entering the blood, and the calcium that constitutes the eggshell comes from the bones. Another example is that in the past, it was believed that plants only absorb nutrients from the soil through their roots. Later, someone tested that the absorption function of cotton roots weakens in the late growth stage, but if radioactive phosphorus-32 is applied to the leaves at this time, strong radioactivity can soon be measured in other parts of the plant, indicating that the leaves have the function of absorbing nutrients. Therefore, people began to use foliar topdressing in the late growth stage of cotton to obtain a bumper harvest. Entomologists use radioactive isotopes to mark flies and mosquitoes, so they can study their distribution range and transfer speed, and thus determine the regional scope of prevention and control to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. It is difficult to study the overwintering places of forest and fruit tree pests. If they are marked with radioactive isotopes, then carry a detection instrument to the field in winter to detect them. No matter where they are cleverly hidden, the radiation emitted from their bodies will ruthlessly point out their hiding places.

	The application of radioactive isotopes as "tracers" in biology has become increasingly widespread, playing a huge revolutionary role in many aspects, and has become one of the sharpest weapons for biologists to uncover the secrets of life.

    揭露生命秘密的“示踪者”
    王永潮
    自然界中的动物种类繁多，形形色色，要弄清楚它们的生活习性、繁殖、迁徙、分布的情况，的确不是一件容易的事情。人们早已熟悉许多种季候鸟在凉秋到临的时候，便成群结队地飞往南方，到春光明媚的季节又飞回北国的故乡；许多种鱼只有在一定的季节才骤然成群地出现。人们不禁会想：这群不倦的“旅行者”到底到什么地方去躲避这严寒的冬天？经过什么途径？在浩大渺茫的海洋中，它们从何而来？又要到哪里去呢？它们又是在哪里繁殖自己的后代？最初没有人能确切地回答这些问题。后来生物学家巧妙地利用了“示踪”的方法，成功地解决了这一问题。就是在鸟腿上套上一个金属环，或在鱼体上做上标记，再把它们放回自然环境中去，将来在不同的地方捕获这种动物时，我们便会从千百只伙伴当中识别它们，于是它们便充当了“示踪者”。从少数这种动物的行为，可以确定它们整个家族的动向。例如确定了海鳗是从欧洲和美洲的江河游向萨拉索瓦海，在那里产卵死亡，几年之后小海鳗长大了，它们又重复它祖先的道路，向西欧和美洲的江河游去。
    随着科学的发展，这种古老的标记方法显然已经十分落后了。就像“新陈代谢”是生物的最大秘密，人吃了食物之后，变成机体中的什么成分？这些成分又是怎样地分解、转化？如果能够把食物成分中的原子或分子也做上一个标记，那么无论它们将来转变成什么，我们都能识别出来。但是原子是很小的粒子，在显微镜下都看不见，旧的标记方法显然无能为力。一直到1934年约里奥·居里夫妇发现了人工方法制造放射性同位素之后，人类的幻想终于变成了事实。
    所谓同位素就是原子序数相同、而其质量数不同的原子。例如磷的原子序数是15，由于质量数不同而有磷—30、磷—31和磷—32等几种。其中磷—32便是放射性同位素，它和其他磷原子没有可区别的化学性质，唯一的标记便是能发放射线。这种射线，人看不见也摸不着，但是可以利用特殊的探测仪器，寻找它的踪迹，测量它的数目。
    利用“示踪原子”的方法将组成脂肪的脂肪酸上的碳原子标记为放射性碳，动物吃下去之后，发现在体内的葡萄糖上也有了放射性，说明脂肪在体内可以转化为糖。同样的方法阐明了体内的醣、脂肪、蛋白可以互相转化。
    在医疗上“示踪原子”的应用是很广泛的。医生利用脑瘤有强烈吸收二碘萤光红染料的特点，将含有放射性碘的二碘萤光红注射到病人体内，借助探测器即可找到脑瘤的位置，便于准确地开颅动手术。
    示踪原子的应用纠正了过去一些错误的观念。例如蛋壳的组成中有钙，过去人们认为钙由食物进入血液，又由血液进入蛋壳；利用放射性钙的研究表明，食物中的钙全部进入骨胳而不是进入血液，构成卵壳的钙是来源于骨胳。又如过去认为植物只有通过根系从土壤中吸收养料。后来有人试验，棉花在生长晚期时根的吸收机能减弱，但这时将放射性磷—32涂在叶上，不久在植株的其他部分，就可以测到强烈的放射性，说明叶子有吸收养料的机能。因此人们开始在棉花生长晚期，使用根外追肥的方法，获得丰产。昆虫学家用放射性同位素标记了苍蝇、蚊子，就可以研究它们的分布范围、转移速度，由此也就能确定防治的区域范围，以防止传染病的蔓延。研究森林、果树害虫的越冬场所是比较困难的，如果把它用放射性同位素标记之后，冬天携带探测仪器到田野里去探测，无论它们巧妙地隐藏在哪里，它体内所发放出的射线会无情地指出它隐蔽的地方。
    放射性同位素作为“示踪者”在生物学中的应用已经日益广泛，在许多方面起着巨大的革命作用，成为生物学家揭露生命秘密的一个最犀利的武器。
