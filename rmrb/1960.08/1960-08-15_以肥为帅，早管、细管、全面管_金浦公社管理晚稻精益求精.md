Guangzhou, August 14th (Report from our newspaper) – Jinpu Commune in Chaoyang County, Guangdong Province, which has consistently adhered to higher standards in carrying out the late-season rice high-yield campaign, has launched a "Ten-Good" field management campaign centered on taking fertilizer as the commander, and implementing early management, detailed management, precise management, and comprehensive management, after completing the transplanting task according to the "Ten-Good Specifications."

Jinpu Commune is one of the famous high-yield communes in the Chaoshan Plain, with a tradition of intensive cultivation and rich experience in applying advanced technologies. This year, on the basis of an 11.8% increase in yield in the early season, they further applied the "Eight-Character Charter" in late-season production. With sufficient fertilizer and strong seedlings, they implemented advanced cultivation techniques according to higher standards. The quality of cultivation has been further improved compared to last year, and a set of "Ten-Good" transplanting specifications centered on reasonable close planting has been promoted. All paddy fields have been deeply ploughed and repeatedly harrowed, and sufficient base fertilizer has been applied, making the soil particularly deep, soft, fertile, and well-rotted. In addition to using old and strong seedlings without diseases and pests, and transplanting 150,000 to 180,000 seedlings per mu according to different soil types, a transplanting ruler is also used to ensure uniform spacing and depth. In order to bring the level of field management work up to the level of cultivation and planting quality, ensure that every link is tightly connected, and achieve the goal of high yield and further high yield, the Commune Party Committee, when turning to field management, used the method of combining cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers to conduct in-depth field inspections, analyze the growth conditions and characteristics of this year's late rice, and summarize the field management experience since last year's late rice. They formulated ten measures and requirements for this year's late rice field management, raising the level of field management by one step.

Ensuring that the rice seedlings grow uniformly, completely, strongly, and evenly is the first measure of Jinpu Commune's late rice field management. Within one week after the end of transplanting at the end of July, the entire commune carried out a comprehensive inspection and replanting of seedlings, first to ensure that the original dense planting specifications were not affected, and to prevent uneven rice seedlings in one field, providing more convenient conditions for the next step of field management.

Jinpu Commune had already mastered a set of methods and experience for irrigation and drainage according to the growth needs of rice seedlings. This year, in order to improve further, they made improvements targeting areas that had not been done well enough in the past, striving for excellence. For example, in the more than 3,000 mu of mountain valley fields in the entire commune, although ditches were dug on both sides of the mountain and behind each terrace to drain cold springs and iron rust water during last year's late season, the cold springs still often seeped and overflowed the fields due to the insufficient depth of the rear ditches, affecting the growth of rice seedlings close to the terrace walls. Therefore, this time, efforts were made to deepen the rear ditches to drain cold springs and iron rust water. As for drainage, it is required to open drainage outlets of various widths and depths according to the different water requirements of rice seedlings at each stage and the size ratio of the fields, so that the water level on the field can be automatically controlled at the required level.

In order to improve the fertilization technology of this year's late rice field management, Jinpu Commune requires continued mastery of the three principles of last year's late season: early application, frequent application, and heavy application of tillering fertilizer. They also emphasize the use of methods such as observing the weather, observing the land, observing the rice color, and observing the fertilizer quality to determine the quantity and composition of fertilizers. At the same time, it is particularly emphasized that a certain amount of fertilizer should be accumulated in advance to ensure that fertilizer is available whenever it is needed, so as to avoid missing opportunities and causing losses. To achieve this goal, when turning to field management, they criticized the fallacy that "increased production is impossible without chemical fertilizers" and the cowardly and lazy thinking of "applying as much as we accumulate", and established a firm concept that field management is led by fertilizer. The Commune Party Committee also summarized and promoted the experience of Meidong Brigade in adhering to the combination of regular fertilizer accumulation and shock fertilizer accumulation, and led the entire commune to formulate fertilizer accumulation and application plans at all levels, ensuring that 40 to 50 dan of urine water and miscellaneous manure are applied per mu before and after the "Chushu" (End of Heat) period for the first topdressing to attack the tillering stage.

Jinpu Commune's late-season field management this year has also been very strict in preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. After the end of transplanting, the entire commune not only ensured that insects were eliminated and diseases were prevented whenever they were found, but also continuously carried out weeding work on all field ridges, so that larvae had no place to hide, and the field ridges could be used to expand the planting of miscellaneous grains.

In order to ensure that this year's late season can be managed comprehensively according to high standards, cadres at all levels of Jinpu Commune continue to adhere to going to the front line to participate in field management labor. In the labor, on the one hand, they strengthen the leadership of high-yield experimental fields at all levels, create experience, and conduct demonstrations; on the other hand, they specifically help backward production teams overcome difficulties, and then promote the "learn from, catch up with, surpass, and help" competition by establishing pacesetters, launching a vigorous mass movement of mutual promotion and mutual impetus. In the short period of eight days after the end of transplanting, the entire commune has completed the inspection, replanting, and irrigation work of seedlings, and has also carried out inter-tillage and weeding on 2,879 mu of fields. In addition, 1,421 mu have been topdressed and 171 mu have been treated for insect pests. (Attached picture)

### 以肥为帅，早管、细管、全面管  金浦公社管理晚稻精益求精

    以肥为帅，早管、细管、全面管
    金浦公社管理晚稻精益求精
    本报广州14日电　一直坚持以更高标准，开展晚造高产运动的广东省潮阳县金浦公社，在按“十好规格”完成插秧任务之后，又掀起了一个以肥为帅，实行早管、细管、精管、全面管的“十好”田间管理运动。
    金浦公社是潮汕平原著名的高产公社之一，向来有精耕细作的传统，在运用先进技术上有丰富的经验，今年晚造生产在早造增产11.8％的丰收基础上，更进一步运用“八字宪法”，在肥足、秧壮的基础上按照更高的标准贯彻先进的栽培技术措施，耕作质量比去年更加提高了一步，推行了一套以合理密植为中心的“十好”插秧规格。所有稻田都经过深耕和多次犁耙，基肥也下得足，田土特别深、软、肥、烂。插秧除采用老壮秧、无病虫害秧，按不同土质，每亩插足十五万到十八万条苗外，还采用插秧尺比量，达到株行距与深浅度均匀一致。为了使田间管理工作的水平跟上耕作、栽培质量的水平，做到环环扣紧，实现高产再高产的目的，公社党委会在转向田间管理时，运用干部、技术员、老农三结合的方法，深入田间检查，分析今年晚稻的生长条件和特点，总结去年晚造以来的田间管理经验，制订了今年晚稻田间管理的十项措施要求，把田间管理的水平提高一步。
    确保禾苗生长齐、全、壮、匀，是金浦公社晚稻田间管理的第一项措施。7月底结束插秧后的一个星期内，对全社全面进行了一次查苗、补苗，首先确保原订的密植规格不受影响，并防止了在一丘田中产生稻苗参差不齐的现象，为下一步的田间管理提供了更加方便的条件。
    金浦公社原来已经掌握了一套按禾苗生长需要，进行排灌的方法和经验，今年晚造为了再提高一步，又针对历来做得不够的地方，进行改进，做到精益求精。例如全社的三千多亩山坑田，去年晚造虽然已经在山两边和每一级梯田的后壁，开沟排除冷泉和铁锈水，但由于后壁沟挖得不够深，冷泉仍时常渗漏，漫溢上田，影响贴近梯壁禾苗生长。因此这次做到加深后壁沟，排除冷泉、铁锈水。至于排水，则要求按禾苗各个时期的不同需水量和田丘的大小比例，开好各种不同宽窄度和深浅度的排水口，使田面水量能够自动控制在所需要的水平上。
    金浦公社为了提高今年晚稻田间管理的施肥技术，要求继续掌握去年晚造的经验：早施、勤施和重施壮尾肥的三个原则，运用看天、看地、看禾色、看肥质，确定肥料数量、成份的施肥方法。同时还特别强调要事先积蓄一定数量的肥料，做到什么时候要施肥就有肥可施，以免坐失良机，造成损失。为了达到这个目的，在转向田间管理时，批判了认为“没有洋化肥就不能增产”的论调和“积到多少就施多少”的懦夫懒汉思想，树立了田间管理由肥料挂帅的坚定观念。公社党委会又总结推广了梅东大队坚持常年积肥与突击积肥相结合的经验，领导全社层层制订积肥、用肥规划。保证在“处暑”前后每一亩田施足四、五十担尿水和杂粪的第一次追肥，猛攻分蘖关。
    金埔公社今年晚造田间管理，对防治病虫害的工作也抓得很紧。插秧结束后，全社不仅做到见虫必除，见病必防，而且还陆续对所有的田基进行一次锄光杂草工作，这样一方面使幼虫没有藏身之地，一方面又可利用田基扩种杂粮。
    金浦公社为了使今年晚造能按高标准全面管好，全社各级干部继续坚持到第一线去参加田间管理的劳动。在劳动中，一面加强对各级高产试验场的领导，创造经验，进行示范；一面具体帮助各个落后生产队，克服困难，再通过树立标兵，开展“学、赶、超、帮”的竞赛，掀起一个互相促进，互相推动的轰轰烈烈的群众运动。结束插秧后短短的八天时间，全社已经完成查苗、补苗和排灌工作，并且对二千八百七十九亩田进行了中耕除草，另外还追肥一千四百二十一亩，除虫一百七十一亩。（附图片）
