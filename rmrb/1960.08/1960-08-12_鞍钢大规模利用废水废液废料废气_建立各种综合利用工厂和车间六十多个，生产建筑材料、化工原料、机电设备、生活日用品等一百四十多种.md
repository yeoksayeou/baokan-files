According to Anshan Daily, a mass movement for large-scale diversified management and comprehensive utilization has been vigorously launched among the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel. Currently, factories and mines have established more than sixty various comprehensive utilization factories and workshops. In just over two months, these factories and workshops have recovered, produced, and refined from waste residue, wastewater, and waste gas over 140 kinds of building materials, mechanical and electrical equipment, chemical raw materials, medicines, and daily necessities, such as tailings, activated slag cement, refractory mud, fiberboard, calcium carbide, small electric motors, small hardware, carbolic acid, quinoline, placental globulin, glucose, distilled water, white wine, and soda, creating a large amount of wealth for the country.

Anshan Iron and Steel is a black metallurgical complex with extremely rich resources. In the steel production process, over a hundred kinds of major waste materials such as wastewater, waste liquid, waste residue, waste gas, gas ash, tar residue, and leftover materials are discharged annually, weighing tens of millions of tons. From these waste materials, a large number of chemical raw materials can be extracted, and various industrial materials and daily necessities can be processed. However, in the past, due to insufficient understanding of developing diversified management and large-scale comprehensive utilization, most of them were transported outside the factory or discharged through sewers, except for a small amount of utilization. This not only consumed a lot of manpower, transportation capacity, and funds, but also occupied a lot of farmland. In order to quickly turn waste materials into useful materials, the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the provincial and municipal Party committees that all enterprises should develop diversified management and large-scale comprehensive utilization, successively convened several Party committee meetings and meetings of factory and mine Party committee secretaries and factory and mine directors, comprehensively discussed the work of diversified management and comprehensive utilization, formulated plans, and established specialized leading and functional institutions for diversified management and comprehensive utilization from top to bottom, equipped with cadres and technical personnel. Based on the principles of doing whatever is lacking, supplementing whatever is insufficient, utilizing whatever is available, starting from scratch, from small to large, using indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, using local materials, simple production, self-reliance, and hard work, all units extensively mobilized the masses to actively develop diversified management and large-scale comprehensive utilization, thus achieving great results. In just two months, factories and mines built twenty-three cement plants of various sizes, producing a large amount of silicate and activated cement. The employees of the Repair Department, who are responsible for all major repair projects of Anshan Iron and Steel, made their own equipment and built their own factories. Within dozens of days, they built an activated slag cement plant with a daily output of more than 2,000 tons, which fully utilized the blast furnace slag that had always been discarded as waste. They also started from scratch and established a comprehensive utilization wood processing plant, turning sawdust and scrap ends left over from construction sites into building materials such as particleboard and fiberboard, saving a lot of wood. Employees of the medical and health departments used human placentas, corn, and ammonium sulfate to make six kinds of advanced medicines such as placental globulin and glucose. Employees of various staff canteens mainly used rice washing water, corn umbilicus, and leftover rice to make white wine, producing more than 5,000 catties in a month. Employees of various staff bathhouses used boiler steam to produce distilled water for industrial use, with a monthly production capacity of more than 3,000 bottles. After the Chemical Plant carried out diversified management and large-scale comprehensive utilization, it trial-produced and put into production a variety of new and valuable products on the basis of its original products. The waste residue, waste gas, waste liquid, wastewater, and waste oil of various factories and mines, after being recycled and utilized, not only saved a large amount of manpower and material resources, creating a large amount of wealth for the country, but also further improved the labor conditions and environmental sanitation of employees. Taking waste slag as an example, according to preliminary calculations, it can save more than 19,000 workdays per year, save more than 2 million yuan in railway extension lines and handling fees, and occupy 30 acres less farmland.

In order to quickly turn the waste materials of various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel into useful materials, the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee, according to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, also adopted forms such as processing orders, jointly running factories, and supplying materials to carry out various aspects of cooperation with many units of local industry and commune industry, which not only developed local industry and commune industry, but also promoted the development of diversified management and comprehensive utilization of Anshan Iron and Steel.

At present, the employees of various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel, in order to more fully utilize waste materials and leftover materials, closely focus on steel production and market needs, and carry out diversified management and comprehensive utilization more deeply and extensively, so that Anshan Iron and Steel will become a comprehensive joint enterprise that is not only based on steel production, but also produces more and better metallurgical materials, chemical raw materials, mechanical power, medicines, and daily necessities for the people.

    鞍钢大规模利用废水废液废料废气
    建立各种综合利用工厂和车间六十多个，生产建筑材料、化工原料、机电设备、生活日用品等一百四十多种
    据鞍山日报消息　一个大搞多种经营和综合利用的群众运动，已在鞍钢广大职工中蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。现在各厂矿已建立起各种综合利用工厂和车间六十多个。这些工厂和车间仅在两个多月的时间里，就从废渣、废水和废气中回收、生产和提炼出尾矿、活化矿渣水泥、耐火泥、纤维板、电石、小电动机、小五金、石碳酸、喹林、胎盘球蛋白、葡萄糖、蒸馏水、白酒、苏达等一百四十多种建筑材料、机电设备、化工原料、医药和人民日常生活用品，为国家创造了大量财富。
    鞍钢是个黑色冶金联合企业，资源极为丰富，在钢铁生产过程中，每年排泻出的废水、废液、废渣、废气、瓦斯灰、焦油渣和边角余料等主要废残物资百余种，重达几千万吨。从这些废残物资中，可以提炼出大量的化工原料，加工出各种工业材料以及人民日常生活用品。但过去由于对开展多种经营和大搞综合利用认识不足，除少量利用外，绝大部分被运到厂外和通过下水道排泻出去。这不仅耗用了大量的人力、运力和经费，而且还占用了许多农田。为了迅速地变废残物资为有用物资，鞍钢党委根据党中央和省、市委关于一切企业都要开展多种经营和大搞综合利用的指示精神，连续召开了数次党委会和厂矿党委书记、厂矿长会议，全面地讨论了多种经营和综合利用的工作，编制了规划，从上到下都成立了多种经营和综合利用的专门领导机构与职能机构，配备了干部和技术人员。根据缺啥办啥，少啥补啥、有啥利用啥，从无到有、从小到大、土法上马、土洋结合、就地取材、简易生产、自力更生的原则，各单位广泛发动群众积极开展多种经营、大搞综合利用，从而取得了很大成绩。各厂矿仅在两个月的时间内就建起了大小水泥厂二十三个，生产了大量的矽酸盐和活化水泥。担负着鞍钢全部大修工程施工任务的修建部职工，自做设备，自建厂房，在几十天之内就建起了日产二千多吨的活化矿渣水泥厂，使一向被当做废物扔掉的高炉矿渣得到了充分利用。他们还白手起家建立了综合利用木材的加工厂，把工地上用剩下的锯末、碎料头制成刨花板、纤维板等建筑材料，节约了许多木材。医疗卫生部门的职工利用人胎盘、苞米和硫铵等制成了胎盘球蛋白、葡萄糖等六种高级药品。各职工食堂职工以淘米水为主，利用苞米脐子和剩饭做白酒，一个月就生产了五千多市斤。各职工浴池利用锅炉的蒸汽生产工业需用的蒸馏水，月产能力达三千多瓶。化工总厂开展多种经营、大搞综合利用以后，在原有产品的基础上，又试制和投产了多种新的贵重产品。各厂矿的废渣、废气、废液、废水、废油等经过回收利用，不仅节省大批人力、物力，为国家创造了大量财富，而且还进一步地改善了职工的劳动条件和环境卫生。以废矿渣为例，据初步计算，每年就可以节省一万九千多个工作日，节约铁路延长线、搬运费等开支二百余万元，少占农田三十多亩。
    为了迅速地把鞍钢各厂矿的废残物资变为有用的物资，鞍钢党委根据市委的指示，还采取通过加工订货、合办工厂、供料等形式同地方工业、公社工业很多单位进行了多方面的协作，既发展了地方工业和公社工业，又促进了鞍钢的多种经营和综合利用的发展。
    目前，鞍钢各厂矿职工为了更充分地利用废残物资和边角余料，紧紧地围绕钢铁生产和市场需要，更加深入、广泛地开展多种经营和综合利用，使鞍钢成为既以钢铁生产为主，又能出产更多更好的冶金材料、化工原料、机械动力、医药和人民日常生活用品的综合性联合企业。
