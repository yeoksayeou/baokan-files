Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 31st: Liu Ningyi and Chen Yu, representatives of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, were invited to attend the 15th Regular Congress of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) today. Amid thunderous applause, Liu Ningyi delivered the following congratulatory speech to the congress:

    On behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and all Chinese workers, I extend my highest respect and warmest congratulations to the delegates attending the "Sohyo" 15th Congress, and through you, to the heroic Japanese worker brothers who have carried out twenty-two large-scale unified actions.
    For more than a year, Sohyo, with its 3.7 million members, and its affiliated industrial unions, together with the broad masses of peace-loving people of Japan, have waged a heroic and sustained struggle, achieving a series of great victories. The widespread protest actions of the Japanese people disrupted the original plans of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to revive Japanese militarism, prevented Eisenhower's "visit to Japan," forced the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, and compelled the United States to announce the withdrawal of U-2 spy planes from Japan. This is a victory of the national mass struggle waged by the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the Japanese people, and it has made a great contribution to the defense of peace in Asia and the world.
    In this great struggle, the Japanese working class, with its exemplary actions and fighting example, promoted and united the people of all strata in Japan to form an unprecedentedly broad unity, opening up a victorious path for the Japanese people to strive for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. The Japanese working class has always stood at the forefront of the anti-American patriotic and just struggle, and has made the most outstanding contributions to this struggle.
    During the same period, Japanese workers also carried out a series of important struggles to oppose "enterprise rationalization," oppose mass layoffs and increased labor intensity, strive to improve their lives, and defend democratic rights. Chinese workers fully support the struggle of Japanese worker brothers to defend their own interests and democratic rights.
    The people and workers of China and Japan have a deep friendship and a common desire for friendly coexistence. At present, the people of our two countries are suffering from the aggression of U.S. imperialism, are committed to defending world peace, advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and hope to establish friendly relations between China and Japan to normalize Sino-Japanese relations. We are very pleased that no matter how the U.S.-Japan reactionaries adopt policies of hostility towards China and hinder the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, the friendly relations between the workers and people of China and Japan continue to deepen and develop. In recent years, our Chinese trade union side has received more than eighty delegations from Sohyo and other Japanese trade unions, totaling nearly one thousand representatives, who visited China. Their visits fully expressed the Japanese people's friendly feelings towards the Chinese people and enhanced mutual understanding and friendship between the workers of China and Japan. Sohyo and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, as well as the corresponding industrial unions of China and Japan, have signed more than ten agreements and joint statements, expressing the strong desire of our two countries' workers to develop friendly relations, strengthen unity, and support each other. In particular, in May of this year, at the initiative of Mr. Kaoru Ota, Chairman of Sohyo, the trade unions of China, Japan, and North Korea signed a joint statement supporting the Japanese people's struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," supporting the struggle of the Miike coal miners, the South Korean people, and the African people. As Mr. Ota said, this "joint statement is a valuable document for strengthening the unity and joint action of Japanese workers with Chinese and Korean workers." At the invitation of Sohyo and other Japanese trade unions, Chinese trade unions have also visited Japan many times, conducting extensive contacts and cordial conversations with Japanese trade union workers and the masses of workers. The hardworking and courageous spirit of the Japanese worker brothers and their sincere friendship towards the Chinese workers and people have left us with the deepest impression.
    The heroic struggle of the Japanese workers and people is a powerful support for our people's socialist peaceful construction. Sohyo and the Japanese workers have made positive efforts to strengthen Sino-Japanese friendship and promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, our workers and people completed the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule in 1959, and are now holding high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, carrying out socialist construction with full confidence. The achievements our people have made in socialist construction are inseparable from the sympathy and support of the Japanese people and the people of the world. We believe that, inspired by the common desire to defend peace and strengthen friendship, and with the further development of extensive contacts and friendly exchanges between the trade unions of the two countries, the close friendship between the workers and trade unions of China and Japan will surely deepen and develop further. Chinese workers are willing to work together with Japanese workers to fight against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and to defend world peace, to safeguard the fundamental interests of the working class, and to promote the unity of the international working class.
    The just struggles of the people of the world support each other. The patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese worker brothers supports the just cause of defending peace and opposing wars of aggression throughout the world, and the working people of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union also unanimously support the heroic struggle of the Japanese working class. The current world situation is favorable to the people and unfavorable to imperialism. The people of Asia and other countries in the world have launched a massive mass movement against imperialism and colonialism, for national independence and to defend world peace. We believe that with the support of the people of the world, the struggle of the Japanese workers and people against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," against the revival of Japanese militarism, demanding the abolition of U.S. military bases, opposing the exploitation and oppression of monopoly capital, and striving for democratic rights will surely achieve greater victory.
    The 15th Congress of Sohyo, convened at the great historical moment of the struggle of the Japanese workers and people, is of extremely great significance. It will make new contributions to further strengthening the unity of the Japanese working class and democratic forces, further raising the awareness of the Japanese working class, and inspiring the Japanese workers to advance victoriously.

    刘宁一向日本总评第十五次定期大会致祝词
    中日两国工人共同反对美帝国主义
    日本人民反美爱国斗争一定会取得更大胜利
    新华社31日讯　东京消息：中华全国总工会代表刘宁一和陈宇今天应邀出席了日本工会总评议会（总评）第十五次定期大会。刘宁一在全场雷动般的掌声中向大会致祝词如下：
    我代表中华全国总工会和中国全体职工向出席“总评”第十五次大会的各位代表，并且通过你们向进行了二十二次大规模统一行动的英雄的日本工人兄弟，致以最崇高的敬意和最热烈的祝贺。
    一年多以来，拥有三百七十万会员的总评及其所属的产业工会，和日本广大爱好和平的人民一道进行了英勇的持续的斗争，取得了一系列的巨大的胜利。日本人民广泛的抗议行动，打乱了美日反动派复活日本军国主义的原定计划，阻止了艾森豪威尔的“访日”，使岸信介内阁下台，美国不得不宣布U—2型间谍飞机从日本撤走。这是日本工人阶级和日本广大人民所进行的全民性群众斗争的胜利，对保卫亚洲和世界的和平作出了伟大的贡献。
    在这一伟大的斗争中，日本工人阶级以自己的模范行动和战斗榜样，推动和团结了日本各阶层人民形成了空前广泛的大团结，开辟了一条日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的胜利道路。日本工人阶级始终站在反美爱国正义斗争的最前列，并为这一斗争作出了最卓越的贡献。
    在这同一时期内，日本工人为反对“企业合理化”、反对大批解雇和加强劳动强度、争取改善生活和保卫民主权利，也进行了一系列的重要斗争。中国工人完全支持日本工人兄弟们保卫切身利益和保卫民主权利的斗争。
    中日两国人民和工人之间有着深厚的友谊和友好相处的共同愿望。目前，我们两国人民正遭受着美帝国主义的侵略灾害，都致力于保卫世界和平，都主张不同社会制度国家实行和平共处，都希望中日两国建立友好关系，使中日关系正常化。我们十分高兴的是，不论美日反动派如何采取敌视中国和阻挠中日两国关系正常化的政策，中日两国工人和人民之间的友好关系却不断加深和发展。我们中国工会方面，几年来接待了总评和其他日本工会访问中国的八十多个代表团近一千位代表，他们的访问充分地表达了日本人民对中国人民的友好感情，增进了中日两国工人之间的相互了解和友谊。日本总评和中国全总之间以及中日两国相应的产业工会之间共签订了十多个协议和联合声明，表达了我们两国工人发展友好关系、加强团结、互相支持的强烈愿望。特别是今年5月，在总评议长太田薰先生的倡议下，中、日、朝三国工会就支持日本人民反对新的日美“安全条约”的斗争，支持三池煤矿工人、南朝鲜人民及非洲人民的斗争，签订了联合声明。正如太田先生所说，这个“联合声明是加强日本工人同中、朝两国工人的团结和联合行动的宝贵文件”。中国工会应总评和其他日本工会的邀请，也多次访问了日本，与日本工会工作者和职工群众进行了广泛的接触和亲切的交谈，日本工人兄弟们的勤劳勇敢的精神以及对中国工人和人民的热诚的友谊，给我们留下了最为深刻的印象。
    日本工人和人民的英勇斗争对我国人民的社会主义和平建设是个有力的支持。日本总评和日本工人为加强中日友好和促进中日两国关系正常化，进行了积极的努力。我国工人和人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在1959年提前三年完成了第二个五年计划，目前正高举着总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，信心百倍地进行着社会主义建设。我国人民在社会主义建设中所获得的成就，是同日本人民和全世界人民的同情和支持分不开的。我们相信，在保卫和平和加强友谊的共同愿望的鼓舞下，随着两国工会之间广泛接触和友好往来的进一步开展，中日两国工人和工会之间的亲密友谊必将日益加深和更加发展。中国工人愿同日本工人一道，为反对共同敌人美帝国主义和保卫世界和平、为维护工人阶级的根本利益、为促进国际工人阶级的团结而共同奋斗。
    全世界人民的正义斗争都是相互支持的。日本工人兄弟的爱国正义斗争支持了全世界的保卫和平、反对侵略战争的正义事业，以苏联为首的社会主义各国的劳动人民也一致地支援日本工人阶级的英勇斗争。目前的世界形势，是有利于人民，而不利于帝国主义的。亚洲和世界其他国家的人民已经掀起了声势浩大的反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取民族独立和保卫世界和平的强大的群众运动。我们相信，在全世界人民的支援下，日本工人和人民反对新的日美“安全条约”、反对日本军国主义复活、要求取消美国军事基地、反对垄断资本的剥削和压迫和争取民主权利的斗争，一定会取得更大的胜利。
    在日本工人和人民斗争的伟大历史时刻所召开的总评第十五次大会是有极其重大意义的。它将对于进一步加强日本工人阶级和民主力量的团结，进一步提高日本工人阶级的觉悟，鼓舞日本工人胜利前进，作出新的贡献。
