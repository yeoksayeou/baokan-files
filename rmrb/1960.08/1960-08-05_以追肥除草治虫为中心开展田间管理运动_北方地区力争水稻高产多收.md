    Heilongjiang: Rice is growing well in various areas and is currently in the jointing and booting stages. At present, the first round of weeding has been basically completed throughout the province, and the second round of weeding is half finished. Approximately 50% of the rice paddies have been topdressed once or twice.
    This year, the rice planting area in Heilongjiang Province has increased by 15.9% compared to last year. In Mohe, located at 53 degrees north latitude in the northernmost part of China, rice trial planting was successful last year. This year, the county's rice planting area has expanded ninefold compared to last year. This year, most of the rice seedlings are growing sturdily throughout the province because they were not short of water during the seedling stage, the mid-cultivation was tightly grasped, the weeding was meticulous, the seedling setting was reasonable, and the irrigation was reasonable.

Xinhua News Agency, Jilin

    Jilin: Rice in various areas has generally undergone two cultivations and weedings. About 70% of the rice has been topdressed once. At present, rice is growing well in various areas. Compared with the same period in past years under similar conditions, the height of rice seedlings is 10-15 cm higher, and they are starting to joint and boot seven to ten days earlier than in previous years. Currently, the broad masses of commune members in various areas are continuing to strengthen late-stage field management. On the one hand, they continue to weed and topdress, cut weeds on the pond banks and both sides of the water trenches, and aquatic plants in the trenches to increase the sunning area and increase the water temperature to promote rice growth; on the other hand, they generally begin deep irrigation to suppress ineffective tillering and promote rice to accelerate jointing and booting, striving to exceed production targets.

Xinhua News Agency, Liaoning

    Liaoning: People's communes in various parts of Liaoning are deploying troops and generals to strengthen rice field management, striving to manage early, manage meticulously, and manage well to achieve high yields and bumper harvests.
    Since the beginning of summer, there have been continuous rainy days in various places, and weeds have grown rapidly. In order to eliminate weeds in time, Party committees at all levels have taken strengthening rice field management as an urgent task. Leading cadres personally go to the front line, participate in production and lead production, and organize various industries in the city to send manpower to the countryside to support rice field weeding work.
    In the rice field management campaign, in view of the situation that rice transplanting was concentrated this year, weeds grew rapidly, and labor was insufficient, various places widely and deeply carried out a tool reform campaign centered on creating and using more rice field cultivation and weeding tools, which greatly improved the efficiency of rice weeding. At the same time, various places also widely opened up sources of fertilizer, actively carried out topdressing, and strengthened irrigation management, which promoted the rapid upgrading of second- and third-class seedlings.

Xinhua News Agency, Ningxia

    Ningxia: Areas in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region's rice-producing areas on both banks of the Yellow River that have experienced rice blast are undergoing comprehensive prevention and treatment to ensure a bumper rice harvest this year.
    This year, the climate here is conducive to the propagation of rice blast fungi, and rice blast occurred earlier than last year. Based on this situation, various places began prevention and treatment from the end of July to control the development and spread of the disease. Currently, two An-2 aircraft are conducting spraying, and manual ground spraying is also being carried out intensively. The surveyors and reporters at the forefront of prevention and control have selected locations for disease observation, and they propose to measure meticulously and accurately to provide timely intelligence for the rapid prevention and control work.
    Various places began preparing and transporting medicines and machinery needed for the prevention and treatment of rice blast as early as the beginning of May.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin

    Tianjin: People's communes in the rice-growing areas of Tianjin concentrated 200,000 laborers to vigorously grasp rice field management, striving for a bumper rice harvest this year.
    Rice in the rice-growing areas of Tianjin this year was transplanted under drought conditions. The city's rice planting area has increased by one-third compared to last year. Now, most of these rice paddies have entered the vigorous tillering stage. In order to enable rice to develop and grow normally, promote strong stems, large panicles, many grains, and full grains, people's communes, in view of the long-term drought and water shortage this year, and the appearance of varying degrees of seedling shortage in a considerable number of rice fields, have focused on seedling checking and replanting in rice field management. At the same time, they have vigorously grasped weeding, topdressing, flood prevention, and pest and disease control to promote crop upgrading. (Attached picture)

    以追肥除草治虫为中心开展田间管理运动
    北方地区力争水稻高产多收	黑龙江
    据新华社讯　黑龙江各地水稻生长良好，正在拔节、孕穗。目前，全省水稻一遍除草已经基本完成，二遍除草也进行了一半，追肥一至二遍的稻田占50％左右。
    黑龙江省今年水稻种植面积，比去年增加了15.9％，在我国最北部北纬五十三度的漠河，去年试种水稻成功，今年这个县水稻种植面积即比去年扩大了九倍。今年，全省水稻由于在小苗期不缺水，中耕抓的紧，除草细致，定苗合理、灌溉合理，因此绝大多数稻苗生长茁壮。	吉　林
    据新华社讯　吉林各地的水稻，已普遍中耕除草两次。70％左右的水稻已经追肥一次。目前各地水稻生长良好。稻秧高度，同过去同样条件的年份同期比较，高出10—15厘米，并比往年提早七到十天，普遍开始拔节孕穗。现在，各地广大社员，正在继续加强后期田间管理，一方面继续除草、追肥，割去池埂、水壕两岸杂草和壕内水生草，增加晒水面积，提高水温，促进水稻生长；另一方面普遍开始深灌，以便抑制无效分蘖，促使水稻加速拔节孕穗，力争超包产。辽　宁
    据新华社讯　辽宁各地人民公社调兵遣将加强水稻田间管理，力争做到管早、管细、管好，实现高产丰收。
    入夏以来，各地阴雨连绵，草苗齐长。为了及时消灭杂草，各级党委都把加强水稻田间管理作为一项紧急任务。领导干部亲临前线，参加生产领导生产，并且组织城市各行各业抽调人力下乡支援水田除草工作。
    在水稻田间管理运动中，各地根据今年水稻插秧期集中，草苗齐长和劳力不足的情况，广泛深入地开展了以大造大用水田中耕除草器为中心的工具改革运动，大大提高了水稻的除草效率。同时，各地还广开肥源，积极进行追肥，加强灌溉管理，促进了二、三类苗很快升级。	宁　夏
    据新华社讯　宁夏回族自治区黄河两岸水稻产区发生稻瘟病的地区，正在全面防治，确保今年水稻大丰收。
    今年这里的气候宜于稻瘟病菌的繁殖，稻瘟病比去年发生的早。根据这种情况，各地从7月下旬就开始防治，以控制病害的发展蔓延。现在有两架安二型飞机进行喷药；地面人工喷撒药剂也在紧张进行。在防治最前哨的各测报站、点的测报员，已选好地点进行病情观察，他们提出要测的细、测的准为防治工作迅速及时提供情报。
    各地早在5月初就开始准备和调运防治稻瘟病需用的药剂和药械。	天　津
    据新华社讯　天津市稻区各人民公社，集中二十万劳力，狠抓水稻田间管理，力争今年水稻丰收。
    天津市稻区今年水稻是抗旱插秧的。全市水稻种植面积比去年扩大了三分之一。现在，这些稻田大部分进入分蘖盛期。为了使水稻正常发育生长，促进秆壮、穗大、粒多、粒饱，各人民公社根据今年长期干旱缺水，有相当一部分稻田出现程度不同的缺苗现象等情况，在稻田管理中，突出地抓住了查苗补苗工作。同时，大抓除草、追肥、防涝和防治病虫害，促进作物升级。（附图片）
