    Small and Large Factories Dot the Landscape, Various Products in a Riot of Color
    Xinjiang's Light Industry Production Scope Continuously Expands
    Products Increase from Less Than a Hundred to Over Ten Thousand Varieties, Beginning to Reverse the Situation of Complete Reliance on External Supply
    (Reported by our newspaper) The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where the foundation of light industry was extremely weak, has, under the ideological guidance of the Autonomous Region Party Committee's proposition of "what is lacking must be created, what exists must be sufficient, and what is sufficient must be abundant," enabled small and large light industrial factories to be scattered across the Tianshan Mountains, with various products in a riot of color. The situation of complete reliance on external supply for light industrial products has begun to be reversed.
    The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has extremely rich resource conditions for vigorously developing light industry. However, before liberation, apart from a few small factories and workshops concentrated in cities, there was essentially no industry in the vast raw material producing areas, and light industrial products were severely lacking. After liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, Party committees at all levels have implemented a complete set of "walking on two legs" principles, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and large, medium, and small scales, launching a mass campaign for the whole people to run industry, bringing the autonomous region's light industry into a new stage of rapid development. By the end of last year, the number of light industrial factories built throughout the region had increased from a dozen in the early days of liberation to 1,662. The "July 1st" Cotton Textile Factory, built in 1952, has been continuously expanded over the years and is now a modern integrated enterprise with 60,000 spindles, 1,800 looms, and an annual output of 60 million meters of printed and dyed fabrics, with a production capacity more than seventeen times greater than in 1952. The first branch of the Kashgar Cotton Textile Factory, which has begun trial operations, the Shihezi "August 1st" Sugar Factory, which processes a thousand tons of sugar beets per day, and the Hotan Silk Reeling Factory, etc., are all modern factories with initial scale. While building these backbone enterprises, the Autonomous Region, in the spirit of developing, consolidating, and improving simultaneously, has adopted a method of combining indigenous and foreign methods to develop small factories in the vast cities and rural areas. For example, the number of factories under the jurisdiction of Urumqi City has increased from seven before 1958 to the current 172. The Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture has more than 280 light industrial enterprises under the direct jurisdiction of counties and cities, of which more than 160 belong to communes, with an average of more than three factories per commune. With the vigorous development of light industry construction, new light industrial cities such as Yining and Shihezi have emerged, and a light industrial production base for the autonomous region has been preliminarily established.
    Under the guidance of the autonomous region Party committee's policy of actively developing light industrial production centered on textiles and sugar production, and striving to achieve basic self-sufficiency in major products in a short period of time, the number of new products is increasing, and the scope of self-sufficiency is continuously expanding. At present, the variety of light industrial products produced throughout the region has increased from less than a hundred in the early days of liberation to more than ten thousand, of which 50% of the products, including cotton cloth, leather, soap, wine, dairy products, reprocessed salt, and various foods, have reached basic self-sufficiency. Mechanized sugar, machine-made paper, thermos bottles, light bulbs, enamelware, glassware, perfumed soap, batteries, and other items that were previously reliant on external supply can also be produced in large quantities. These products, through continuous improvement and upgrading, are generally of good quality. The famous Hotan carpets are not only richly and beautifully patterned, but also have strong resilience, making them popular and valuable products. Many products such as milk powder, enamelware, bone and horn products, high-grade candies, and pastries have reached advanced national levels in some respects.
    Since the beginning of this year, cadres and workers of all ethnic groups on the light industry front have extensively carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements centered on "four modernizations," and the output and variety of various light industrial products have been further significantly improved. The output of fourteen products, including industrial ceramics, granulated sugar, carpets, alcohol, and enamel basins, has increased by one to six times compared to the same period last year. The workers of the "July 1st" Printing and Dyeing Factory have successfully trial-produced high-temperature printing and dyeing, simplifying the processing procedures and dramatically increasing production capacity by three times.

    大小工厂星罗棋布　各种产品万紫千红
    新疆轻工业生产范围不断扩大
    产品由不到百种增加到一万多种，开始扭转了完全依靠外地供应的局面
    本报讯　轻工业基础异常薄弱的新疆维吾尔自治区，在自治区党委提出“没有的要有，有的要够，够的要多”的思想指导下，已经使天山南北大小轻工业工厂星罗棋布，各种产品万紫千红。轻工业产品完全依靠外地供应的局面，已经开始扭转。
    新疆维吾尔自治区有极为丰富的资源条件，可以大力发展轻工业。但是，解放以前，除集中在城市的几家小型工厂和作坊外，广大的原料产地根本没有什么工业，轻工业产品十分缺乏。解放以后，特别是大跃进和人民公社化以来，各级党委贯彻土洋并举、大中小结合的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，掀起了全民大办工业的热潮，使自治区的轻工业进入了飞跃发展的新阶段。到去年年底，全区已建成的轻工业工厂，由解放初期的十几个发展到一千六百六十二个。1952年建成的“七一”棉纺织厂，经过连年扩建，现在已是拥有六万纱锭、一千八百台布机和年产六千万米印染品的现代化联合企业，生产能力比1952年增长了十七倍多。已经开始试车的喀什棉纺织厂一分厂，日处理千吨甜菜的石河子“八一”糖厂，以及和田缫丝厂等，都是初具规模的现代化工厂。自治区在兴建这些骨干企业的同时，本着边发展，边巩固，边提高的精神，采用土洋结合的办法，在广大的城市和农村发展小型工厂。如乌鲁木齐市属工厂，就由1958年以前的七个发展到目前的一百七十二个。伊犁哈萨克自治州直辖县市现有二百八十多个轻工业企业，其中公社所属的有一百六十多个，平均每个公社有三个以上工厂。随着轻工业建设的蓬勃发展，已出现了伊宁、石河子等新型的轻工业城市，初步建立了自治区的轻工业生产基地。
    在自治区党委提出的积极发展纺织、制糖为中心的轻工业生产，争取主要产品在短时间内达到基本自给的方针指导下，新增产品越来越多，自给范围不断扩大。目前，全区生产的各种轻工业产品，已由解放初期的不到百种增加到一万多种，其中有50％的产品，包括棉布、皮革、肥皂、酒、乳制品、再制盐和各种食品等，已达到基本自给。一向依靠外地供应的机制糖、机制纸、热水瓶、电灯泡、搪瓷制品、玻璃器皿、香皂、电池等也可以大批生产。这些产品，经过不断改进和提高，质量一般都很好。著名的和田地毯，不仅图案花纹富丽美观，而且回弹力强，是很受欢迎的名贵产品。奶粉、搪瓷制品、骨角制品、高级糖果和糕点等许多产品，有的已赶上了全国的先进水平。
    今年以来，轻工业战线上的各族职工，广泛开展了以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，各种轻工业产品产量和品种都有了进一步的显著提高。有十四种产品，包括工业陶瓷、食糖、地毯、酒精、搪瓷面盆等，产量比去年同期增长一至六倍。“七一”印染厂的职工，试制成高温印染，简化了加工程序，生产能力猛增三倍。（附图片）
