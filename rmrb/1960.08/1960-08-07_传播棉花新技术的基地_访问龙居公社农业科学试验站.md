    Base for Spreading New Cotton Technology
    Visiting the Longju Commune Agricultural Science Experiment Station	Sha Yin, Guanquelou
    Arriving in Yuncheng County, southern Shanxi, a major cotton-producing area, everyone wants to see the cotton in Xizhanggeng. Here, hundreds of acres of cotton are growing neatly and beautifully, each plant like a "tower pine," with cotton bolls hanging heavily on the "tower pines."
    This cotton field belongs to the Longju Commune Agricultural Science Experiment Station. The members of the experiment station include Qu Yaoli, a national cotton-growing model, local experts and skilled cotton growers Wang Yunsheng, Yao Fenglan, and Yang Taosheng, as well as more than forty young commune members. The entire station manages more than 320 acres of cotton fields, implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" according to local natural conditions, creating experience and setting an example for the entire commune's cotton field management work.
        Winning the First Battle of Spring
    In March, the cotton sowing date was approaching day by day. The soil moisture content was poor at the end of last year, and there was a lack of rain this spring. How to ensure full seedling emergence and strong seedlings under drought conditions? This was a matter of concern for the people of the entire commune. There were different opinions among the commune members on this issue. A debate also took place within the Agricultural Science Experiment Station.
    The problem first occurred in seed treatment: "Is high-temperature soaking good, or warm water soaking good?" One group said: "In previous years, cotton was sown using high-temperature soaking at 50 to 60 degrees Celsius, which could kill bacteria and promote early seedling emergence." Another group said: "Last year, there was a severe drought during the cotton growing season, and the cotton seeds were not mature enough, and the seeds were not full. If high-temperature soaking is used, some seeds will be scalded to death, which will affect the full seedling emergence. Warm water soaking at about 40 degrees Celsius is the most suitable." Both opinions made sense, but which one should be adopted? Yu Zaiyang, the secretary of the Party branch of the experiment station, said: "As in the past, if there is a dispute, let's experiment." They immediately conducted a germination test, and the results showed that the germination rate of warm water soaking was as high as 99%, while the germination rate of high-temperature soaking was only about 70%, with about 30% being scalded to death. This stopped the debate. Seeing that the experience of the Agricultural Science Experiment Station was good, the commune Party committee made a decision to soak all cotton seeds in warm water and promoted it throughout the commune.
    The matter of seed treatment had just subsided when a debate arose about the sowing depth. The question was raised like this: According to this year's soil moisture content, what is the appropriate sowing depth? Some believed that the weather was dry and lacking rain this year, so it should be sown deep at about 2 to 2.5 inches. Others believed that it should be sown shallow, their reason being: the Dai Zi No. 15 cotton seeds have weak seedling emergence, small seeds, and weak soil-breaking ability, with a maximum depth of no more than 1.5 inches. This problem was still solved by the experiment station. As expected, 60% to 70% of the cotton seedlings sown at more than 1.6 inches emerged with caps, and the seedlings were not strong. The cotton seeds sown at 1.3 to 1.4 inches emerged completely and evenly. About 30% of the cotton seeds sown at more than 2 inches rotted, and 40% of the cotton seedlings became "hunchbacks" because of their weak soil-breaking ability and did not emerge. The commune Party committee again adopted the opinions of the experiment station and included this appropriate depth in the sowing technical plan for widespread promotion.
    Sowing is the first battle of agricultural production in a year. Based on this experiment station, the Longju Commune adopted a new set of cultivation techniques suitable to local conditions and time, and the 38,913 acres of cotton fields throughout the commune generally emerged neatly, evenly, and vigorously. The commune members said happily: "The Agricultural Science Experiment Station has made a great contribution to the full seedling emergence of this year's cotton fields."
      Found a Good Way to Irrigate Cotton
    In June, the scorching sun was overhead, and since the cotton sowing, there had not been a single thorough rain, and the soil moisture content had dropped to only 8% to 10%. Under the threat of drought, dryland cotton was creeping on the ground and not growing, and even irrigated cotton was "resting." At that time, who in the whole commune was not anxious! The commune Party committee decided to start up all the machines that could be started, and use all the water sources that could be used, irrigating from low water to high places, irrigating from south to north, irrigating from combined canals to distant places, day and night to fight drought. But how should it be irrigated? People again had different opinions. Some advocated frequent and light irrigation, the reason being "long drought should not be thoroughly irrigated, cotton seedlings are like people, if they are thirsty for too long, suddenly letting them drink their fill will affect growth." Others advocated thorough irrigation, the reason being: "Light irrigation several times will not awaken the cotton seedlings, and will affect yield." At this critical juncture, Qu Yaoli, one of the main members of the experiment station, expressed his opinion: "In the past, I explored a method of irrigation in cotton planting, which is light irrigation and frequent irrigation. But farming should be based on the weather, the land, and the cotton. This year's situation has changed. If you don't thoroughly irrigate, not only will you not increase buds and bolls, but even if you increase them, you won't be able to keep them, and if you keep them, they will be small buds, small flowers, and small bolls." The Agricultural Science Experiment Station also conducted experiments in the experimental fields. An investigation was conducted two days after watering, and great changes occurred in the thoroughly irrigated cotton fields: the branches and leaves were tender green, and did not curl under the scorching sun at noon, and grew about two inches. On the contrary, in the lightly irrigated cotton fields, the changes were not significant, and there was still curling at noon. According to the experimental situation of the experiment station, the commune Party committee organized the production team cadres and technicians of the whole commune to visit the experiment station and resolutely promoted the method of thorough irrigation. A subsequent survey showed that all the thoroughly irrigated cotton seedlings grew very well.
    The Problem of Protecting Buds and Bolls is Solved
    Growing cotton means picking more cotton, and the purpose of growing and managing well is to make the cotton appear buds early, bloom more, not drop bolls, form large bolls, and pick more cotton. This year, the Longju Commune Party Committee issued a battle call to all commune members: "Protect Buds, Protect Bolls, Protect Bolls." The commune members again hoped that the experiment station could provide good methods.
    The labor models and skilled cotton growers of the experiment station sat together and carefully summarized the experience and lessons of protecting buds and bolls in previous years. The reasons for the shedding of cotton buds and bolls in previous years were: insufficient fertilizer, poor nutrition of cotton plants, flower buds and seedlings not getting enough nutrients; pests and diseases disrupting the normal physiological process of cotton plants, tall cotton plants, dense leaves, and poor ventilation and light transmission; drought threatening, excessive evaporation of moisture from leaf surfaces. The lack of water inside the plant made it easy for buds and bolls to fall off. Growing cotton is like fighting a war, you can only win if you understand the enemy's situation. After they found out the main reasons for the shedding of buds and bolls, they formulated a series of measures to protect buds and bolls. According to the characteristics of this year's drought, they changed the past habit of only irrigating buds and not irrigating bolls, and watered half a month earlier than last year, and watered twice thoroughly before the onset of hot weather. According to the ground temperature, soil moisture, and cotton growth, they watered three times appropriately during the boll protection period; implemented the principle of no insect prevention of insects, treatment of insects when they appear, early treatment of treatment, and adopted continuous prevention and control methods, treating every five to seven days, completely eliminating red spiders, bollworms, aphids, blind bugs and other pests; fertilizer application emphasized "skill", during the budding period, 15 to 20 catties of superphosphate and ammonium sulfate and other phosphate fertilizers and nitrogen fertilizers were applied per mu, or three large carts of falling soil, kang soil, etc.
    After reviewing their measures, the commune Party committee believed that they were good methods suitable to this year's natural characteristics, and held on-site meetings on bud management at the Agricultural Science Experiment Station on a sub-item and sub-stage basis, specially studied the work of protecting buds and bolls, and achieved pest control overnight, completing soil cultivation in two days, watering every five days, and managing every plant. Therefore, when 14,000 mu of irrigated cotton in the whole commune entered the hot weather, each plant had an average of more than five bolls, and the shedding of buds and bolls was reduced from about 70% in the past to 33% to 9.9%.
      Conclusion of the Commune Party Committee Secretary
    This Agricultural Science Experiment Station played a huge role in promoting cotton management throughout the commune. The commune Party committee not only regarded the Agricultural Science Experiment Station as a scientific research base and a place for cultivating talent, but more importantly, as a support for guiding the overall situation, so that the pulse of large-field management followed the pulse of the Agricultural Science Experiment Station. What we have introduced here is only a part of a part. Now let Wang Keqin, the first secretary of the Longju Commune Party Committee, make a conclusion. Comrade Wang Keqin said: Our experiment station was established on October 10 last year. At that time, it was just after the great revolution in farmland, and the land was connected into pieces. How to guide large-field production, the Agricultural Science Experiment Station helped us solve this problem.

    传播棉花新技术的基地
    访问龙居公社农业科学试验站	莎荫　鹳雀楼
    来到山西南部盛产棉花的运城县，谁都想到西张耿看看棉花。这里有几百亩棉花长得齐整、好看，一棵棵都跟“塔儿松”一样，累累棉桃挂在“塔儿松”的上面。
    这片棉田是龙居公社农业科学试验站的。试验站的成员，有全国植棉模范曲耀离，土专家、植棉能手王运升、姚凤兰和杨桃盛以及四十多青年社员。全站经营的棉田有三百二十多亩，他们按照当地的自然条件贯彻执行“农业八字宪法”，给全公社的棉田管理工作创造经验和树立了榜样。
        打胜了开春第一仗
    3月中，棉花播种日期一天天逼近了，去年底墒不好，今年春天雨水欠缺，在干旱的情况下，怎么保证全苗、苗壮？这是全公社人们关心的事。对这个问题，社员中各有不同的意见。在农业科学试验站内，也发生了一场争论。
    问题首先发生在种籽处理上，“高温浸种好呢？还是温水浸种好？”一派说：“往年种棉花，都是用五十度至六十度的高温浸种，一则能杀死病菌，二则能促苗早出。”另一派说：“去年棉花伏期大旱，后期棉籽成熟不够，籽粒不饱。如果用高温浸种会烫死一部分种籽，影响全苗。用四十度左右温水浸种最合适。”两种意见都有道理，到底采取哪种？试验站的党支部书记鱼在洋说：“还是像过去那样，有争论就试验。”他们就立刻作了发芽试验，结果是温水浸种出苗率最高达99％，高温浸种的出苗率仅达70％左右，有30％被烫死。这一下争论停止了。公社党委见农业科学试验站的经验好，就作出棉籽全部温水浸种的决定，在全公社推行了。
    处理种籽的事刚刚平息，又争论起播种深度的问题来。问题是这么提出来的：根据今年的墒情到底播种多么深合适？有的认为今年天气缺雨干旱，应当深播在二寸至二寸半左右。另一些人却认为应当浅种，他们的理由是：岱字十五号棉籽发苗弱，籽粒小，顶土力不强，最深不得超过一寸半。这问题还是试验站解决的。果然播种在一寸六分以上的有60％至70％棉苗出土带帽，幼苗不壮。播种在一寸三分至一寸四分的棉籽出苗齐全匀壮。播种在二寸以上的有30％左右棉籽腐烂，有40％棉苗因顶土力弱，未出土已成“弓腰”。公社党委又采纳了试验站的意见，按这个适当的深度列入播种技术方案，普遍推行。
    播种是一年中农业生产的第一个战役。龙居公社依据这个试验站，因时因地制宜，采取了一套新的耕作技术，全社三万八千九百一十三亩棉田普遍出苗整齐、均匀、茁壮。社员们高兴地说：“农业科学试验站对今年的棉田全苗贡献真不小。”
      找到了浇棉花的好办法
    6月，烈日当头，加上从棉花播种以后，没下过一场透雨，土壤含水量已少到只有8％到10％了。在干旱威胁下，旱地棉花爬在地上不长，水地棉花也都在“休息”。那时候全公社谁不心急如火！公社党委决定，把一切能开动的机器都开动起来，一切能利用的水源都利用起来，低水高浇，南水北浇，合渠远浇，日夜不停地浇灌抗旱。但是究竟怎样个浇法？人们又有了不同的意见。有人主张勤浇轻浇，理由是“久旱不宜饱浇，棉苗和人一样，如果渴的太久，猛然让他饱喝一顿，会影响生长”。另一种人主张饱浇，理由是：“轻浇几水润不醒棉苗，会影响产量”。在这个节骨眼上，试验站的主要成员之一曲耀离发表了他的意见：“过去我在植棉中摸索到一条浇水办法，就是轻浇、勤浇。但是种庄稼应看天，看地，看棉花办事。今年的情况变化了。如果不饱浇水，不但不会增蕾增铃，增了也保不住，保住了也是小蕾小花小桃。农业科学试验站又在试验田里进行了试验。浇水后两天进行一次调查，饱浇的棉田起了很大的变化：枝叶嫩绿，中午烈日下也不卷叶，并且生长了二寸左右。相反，在轻浇的棉田里，变化不大，中午还有卷叶现象。公社党委根据试验站的试验情况，组织了全社生产队干部、技术员到试验站参观，坚决推广了饱浇的办法。事后调查，所有饱浇过的棉田，棉苗生长得都很好。
    保蕾保铃的问题解决了
    种棉花就是要多摘棉花，种好管好目的就是叫棉花早现蕾，多开花，不落铃，结大桃，多摘棉花。今年龙居公社的党委向全社社员发出了：“保蕾、保铃、保桃”的战斗号召。社员们又个个企望试验站能给提供好办法。
    试验站的劳动模范、植棉能手们坐在一起，认真地总结了往年保蕾保铃的经验、教训。往年棉花蕾铃脱落的原因是：肥料不足，棉花植株营养不良，花蕾和幼株得不到充足的养料；病虫危害就乱了棉株生理过程的正常进行，棉株高，叶子密茂，不易通风透光；干旱威胁，叶面水分蒸发过大。植株内部水分缺乏，蕾铃容易脱落。作务棉花和打仗一样，了解敌情才能取得胜利。他们找出蕾铃脱落主要原因以后，订出了一系列保蕾保铃的办法，根据今年天气干旱的特点，改变了已往浇蕾不浇铃的习惯，比去年提早半月浇水，赶伏前全面浇水二次。根据地温地墒和棉花生长情况，在保铃保蕾期适量浇水三次；执行无虫防虫，有虫治虫，治早治了的原则，采取了连续防治的办法，每五天至七天治一次，全部歼灭红蜘蛛、红铃虫、蚜虫、盲椿象等虫害；施肥讲“巧”，现蕾期间，每亩施过磷酸钙、硫酸铵等磷肥、氮肥，各十五斤到二十斤或三大车落房土、炕土等等。
    公社党委审查了他们的措施以后，认为是适合今年自然特点的好办法，就分项、分段在农业科学试验站召开蕾期管理现场会议，专门研究了保蕾保铃的工作，作到了治虫不过夜，中耕两天完，五天浇一水，株株有人管。因此全社一万四千亩水地棉花入伏时平均每株带铃五个以上，蕾铃脱落由过去的70％左右减少到33％至9.9％。
      公社党委书记的结论
    这个农业科学试验站对全公社的棉花管理起到了巨大的推动作用，公社党委不仅把农业科学试验站作为科学研究基地，培养人材场所，更重要的是作为指导全面的依托，使大田管理的脉搏随着农业科学试验站的脉搏跳动。这里我们介绍的仅仅是一部分中的一部分，现在还是让龙居公社党委第一书记王克勤作个结论吧，王克勤同志说：我们的试验站，是去年10月10日办的。当时正是农田大革命以后，土地连成片了，怎么指导大田生产，农业科学试验站帮助我们解决了这个问题。
