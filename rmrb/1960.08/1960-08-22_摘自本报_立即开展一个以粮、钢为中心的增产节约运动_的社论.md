Production increase and economy is a mass movement involving the entire people. The first step is to extensively and deeply mobilize the masses to participate. All communes, enterprises, government offices, schools, and military units across the country, without exception, must mobilize the masses to inspect the production and economy situation of the previous seven and a half months (those without production tasks should focus on inspecting the economy situation), discuss and formulate production increase and economy plans for the next four and a half months, and specific measures to realize these plans. In rural areas, every commune, production brigade, production team, and production group must conduct discussions and make specific arrangements centered on the management of autumn fields and the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and preparations for autumn and winter sowing. In industry, the specific plans allocated to each unit by the state must be communicated to the workers and staff, mobilizing the workers of every factory, mine, workshop, blast furnace, converter, working face, and other grassroots units to conduct discussions and set specific monthly, ten-day, and even daily targets for completing and over fulfilling the state plan, as well as measures to achieve these targets. Such discussions should include five aspects: output, quality, variety, cost reduction, and safe production. Every station, dock, locomotive, ship, and automobile in the transportation sector, and every engineering company, construction site, and group in the capital construction sector, must also discuss and formulate specific production increase and economy plans and guarantee measures centered on the main indicators of their respective departments. Government offices, schools, military units, and all public institutions should mobilize the masses to focus on discussing economy and related production issues. In this way, through nationwide discussion, we can tap the potential for production increase and economy, find practical and feasible measures for production increase and economy, and further mobilize the enthusiasm of the people across the country to build socialism, thereby providing a more reliable guarantee for completing and over fulfilling various indicators of the national economy.

    增产节约是一个全民性的群众运动。首先要广泛地深入地发动群众参加。全国一切公社、企业、机关、学校、部队，无一例外地都要发动群众检查前七个半月的生产和节约情况（没有生产任务的，着重检查节约情况），讨论和制订今后四个半月的增产节约计划和实现计划的具体措施。在农村方面，每一个公社、生产大队、生产队、生产小组，都要围绕着秋田管理和秋收、秋耕和秋冬播种的准备工作进行讨论并且作出具体的安排。在工业方面，必须把国家分配给各单位的具体计划告诉职工群众，发动每一个厂矿、车间高炉、转炉、掌子面等基层单位的职工，进行讨论，订出为完成和超额完成国家计划的每月、每旬以至每天的具体指标和完成这些指标的措施。这种讨论，应该包括产量、质量、品种、降低成本、安全生产等五方面。交通运输部门的每一个车站、码头、机车、轮船、汽车，基本建设部门的每一个工程公司、工地、小组，也都要围绕着本部门的几项主要指标，讨论和制定具体的增产节约针划和保证办法。机关、学校、部队及一切事业单位，要发动群众着重讨论节约和有关的生产的问题。这样，经过全民的讨论。挖掘增产节约的潜力，找到切实可行的增产节约措施，把全国人民建设社会主义的积极性进一步调动起来，从而使完成和超额完成国民经济的各项指标得到更加可靠的保证。
