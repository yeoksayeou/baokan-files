Shijingshan Steel, Baotou Steel, and Ma'anshan Steel Conscientiously Implement the Principle of "The Whole Country as One Chessboard," Transferring Pig Iron On Time, With Quality, and in Quantity

    (Our newspaper reports) Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company has conscientiously implemented the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard." In the first and middle ten days of August, it completed 102% of the state's pig iron allocation plan, shipping large quantities of pig iron to more than forty units across the country.
    The company's Party committee regularly educates employees on "the whole country as one chessboard." Employees in the iron smelting plant, transportation department, and supply and marketing departments all regard fulfilling the state's pig iron allocation plan as their top priority. In order to jointly achieve the pig iron allocation plan, they have formed a "one-stop" large-scale cooperation network of production, transportation, and sales. In August, the employees of each blast furnace in the iron smelting plant did everything possible to organize production strictly according to the quantity and variety required by the plan. The employees of the No. 2 blast furnace adopted the method of adjusting the furnace top charging, overcoming the impact of changes in raw material conditions on the blast furnace, so that the daily pig iron production level in the first ten days of the month increased by 4.1% compared with July, and the qualification rate reached 100%. In order to transport the smelted pig iron to the user units across the country in a timely manner, the employees of the transportation department strengthened the organization and dispatch of transportation and improved the shipping speed.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 25th) Baotou Iron and Steel Company actively transfers high-quality pig iron to support steelmaking and agricultural technology transformation in other regions. According to statistics, the pig iron transferred out from August 1st to 21st increased by 32% compared with the same period in July. The pig iron planned to be transferred to the Ministry of Agricultural Machinery in August to support agriculture was all transferred out in the first ten days of the month; 70% of the pig iron used to support steelmaking in Shanghai was transferred out; and 90% of the pig iron supplied to the mechanical industry in various regions was transferred out. Among these transferred pig iron, more than 90% are high-quality iron produced by large blast furnaces.
    The leading cadres of Baotou Steel implement the idea of the whole country as one chessboard, attach great importance to the work of transferring pig iron, and often go deep into the front line to check and supervise, and solve problems at any time.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 25th) Under the guidance of the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard," Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company has overfulfilled the task of transferring pig iron to Shanghai every month since the beginning of this year. From January to July, the pig iron transferred to Shanghai exceeded the plan by more than 13,500 tons; in the first half of August, it overfulfilled the transfer plan by another 10%.
    The leading cadres of the Ma'anshan Municipal Party Committee and Ma'anshan Steel, in addition to regularly arranging pig iron transfer plans, often go to warehouses and loading sites to check the shipping situation. The Party committees of each iron smelting plant conscientiously implement the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, regard the external transfer of pig iron as a glorious task, and often educate employees to smelt more iron and smelt good iron to support Shanghai with high-quality pig iron. In order to achieve more loading and faster transportation, the iron smelting plants and transportation departments closely cooperate and work together.

    石钢、包钢、马钢切实贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针
    按时按质按量外调生铁
    本报讯　石景山钢铁公司认真贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针，8月上、中旬完成国家生铁调拨计划102％，为全国各地四十多个单位发运了大批生铁。
    这个公司的党委经常向职工进行“全国一盘棋”的教育，炼铁厂、运输部和供销部门的职工都把完成国家规定的生铁调拨计划当成首要任务。他们为了共同实现生铁调拨计划，组成了一个产运销“一条龙”的大协作网。8月份，炼铁厂各个高炉的职工就是千方百计严格按照计划要求的数量和品种组织生产的。二高炉职工采取调整炉顶装料的办法，克服了原料条件变化后对高炉的影响，使上旬生铁日产水平比7月份提高了4.1％，合格率达到百分之一百。运输部职工为了把炼出的生铁及时运往全国各地用货单位，加强了运输的组织调度工作，提高了发运速度。
    新华社包头25日电　包头钢铁公司积极外调优质生铁，支援其他地区炼钢和农业技术改造。据统计，8月1日至21日外调的生铁比7月同期增长32％。8月份计划调给农业机械部支援农业的生铁，已于上旬全部调出；支援上海炼钢用的生铁调出了70％；供给各地机械工业的生铁调出了90％。这些外调的生铁中，90％以上都是大高炉生产的优质铁。
    包钢领导干部贯彻全国一盘棋思想，对外调生铁的工作非常重视，经常深入第一线检查督促，遇到问题随时解决。
    据新华社合肥25日电　马鞍山钢铁公司在全国一盘棋思想指导下，今年以来月月超额完成向上海调运生铁的任务。1至7月份调往上海的生铁，超过计划一万三千五百多吨；8月上半月，又超额10％完成了调运计划。
    中共马鞍山市委和马钢的领导干部，除了定期安排生铁外调计划以外，还经常到仓库和装车现场检查发运情况。各炼铁厂党委都认真贯彻市委的指示，把外调生铁作为一项光荣任务，经常教育职工多炼铁、炼好铁，以优质生铁支援上海。为了做到多装快运，各炼铁厂和运输部门紧密配合，共同协作。
