Xinhua News Agency, August 1st dispatch from Jakarta: Antara News Agency reported that the Medan military base commander in Indonesia detained five Overseas Chinese leaders, closed the Medan Overseas Chinese General Association office, and ordered three local Overseas Chinese newspapers to cease publication, because the Overseas Chinese in Medan spontaneously commemorated the Overseas Chinese women killed in the Tjimahi incident on July 12th. Lieutenant Colonel Nur Nasution, commander of the Medan base, confirmed this news in a speech on July 27th. Antara News Agency quoted Nur Nasution as saying that the Overseas Chinese gathered at the Overseas Chinese General Association office on the 12th to prepare for the memorial service were dispersed by "state tools." Some of them went to another place to hold a memorial ceremony, but were also dispersed. Afterwards, the Overseas Chinese went to the Governor's office, requesting permission to hold a memorial service and demanding the withdrawal of the army troops stationed at the Overseas Chinese General Association.

According to reports, Nur Nasution groundlessly attacked the Overseas Chinese for holding a memorial service and requesting permission from the Governor to hold a memorial service as a so-called "political demonstration" or having a "demonstrative form." He said that fifteen Overseas Chinese leaders met with him on July 12th, insisting that they had not done anything illegal. He immediately ordered the fifteen people to be interrogated by the military police. Five of them were detained and will be submitted to the court for trial. He also announced that the North Sumatra wartime authority, based on the recommendation of the Medan base command, had ordered the three Overseas Chinese newspapers in Medan—"Democratic Daily," "Sumatra People's Daily," and "Overseas Chinese Daily"—to cease publication, on the grounds that these newspapers published so-called "messages with the nature of inciting this memorial ceremony."

    追悼芝马圩事件被害同胞竟成罪状
    棉兰五名华侨领袖被拘留
    华侨总会办事处被封闭　华侨报纸被迫停刊
    新华社1日讯　雅加达消息：安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚棉兰基地司令拘留了五名华侨领袖，封闭了棉兰华侨总会办事处，勒令当地的三家华侨报纸停刊，原因是棉兰的华侨7月12日自发地追悼在芝马圩事件中被杀害的华侨妇女。棉兰基地司令努尔·纳苏蒂安中校在7月27日发表的谈话中证实了这个消息。安塔拉通讯社援引努尔·纳苏蒂安的话说，12日聚集在华侨总会办事处准备举行追悼会的华侨被“国家工具”驱散。其中一部分人到另一个地方去举行追悼仪式，也被驱散。其后华侨到省长办事处去，要求准许他们举行追悼会，并要求撤走守在华侨总会的陆军部队。
    据报道，努尔·纳苏蒂安毫无道理地攻击华侨举行追悼会和向省长要求准许举行追悼会是所谓“政治性示威”或具有“示威形式”。他说，十五名华侨领袖在7月12日去见他，坚称他们没有做任何违法的事。他即命令把这十五个人由宪兵部进行审讯。其中五人遭到扣留，并将提交法院审讯。他又宣布，北苏门答腊战时掌权部根据棉兰基地司令部的建议，已命令棉兰的三家华侨报纸——“民主日报”、“苏门答腊民报”和“华侨日报”停止出版，理由是这些报纸刊载了所谓“具有煽动举行这个追悼仪式的性质的消息”。
