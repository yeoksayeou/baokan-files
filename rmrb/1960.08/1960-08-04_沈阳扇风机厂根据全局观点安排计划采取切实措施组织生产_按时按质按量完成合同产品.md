Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 3rd: The Party Committee of Shenyang Fan Factory, in organizing and leading production, implements the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," focusing on products specified in the purchase contract, grasping production work by month, ten-day period, day, and variety specification, and doing everything possible to ensure the completion of the tasks stipulated in the purchase contract. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has completed its variety plan every month and has also comprehensively completed other indicator plans. Up to now, the factory has completed 6,157 various blowers and ventilators according to contract this year, basically ensuring that each product does not exceed the contract period. In terms of quality, all 45 types of fans currently produced by the factory have reached the most advanced technical level in China, and some have reached the advanced international level. The factory's timely completion of contract tasks has created favorable conditions for more than 160 metallurgical, coal, petroleum, chemical, power, and other projects across the country that are supplied with fans by the factory to be put into production on schedule or ahead of schedule.

　　In arranging plans and organizing production, the factory Party Committee implements the principles of giving priority to the state over the locality, to key projects over general projects, and to planned production over unplanned production. For example, when drawing up plans, the orders of state-owned enterprises are given priority. In all aspects, such as the supply of materials and tools, priority is also given to ensuring the production of state contract products.

　　In order to make all cadres and workers attach importance to completing contract tasks, the Party Committee, while strengthening education for employees, also clarifies contract tasks at each level and implements each item. When drawing up production plans, they note contract products, and key products are given special instructions and requirements. This enables the cadres and workers in charge of production at the factory, workshop, and even team levels to have a clear understanding of contract products.

　　In organizing production, the factory also gives contract products "three priorities," namely, workshops give priority to arranging progress in the preparation of operation plans; teams or groups give priority to starting production; and priority is given to completion. For state contract products that are particularly urgently needed, the method of "five concessions and one non-concession" is used to ensure completion. The "five concessions" are: manpower concessions, equipment concessions, material concessions, tool concessions, and transportation concessions; the "one non-concession" is no delay in progress. This makes it possible to mobilize the greatest strength to fight annihilation battles to complete contract tasks. For example, to support Anshan Iron and Steel, 45 fans urgently needed before July this year were technically complex and difficult to manufacture, and had never been manufactured in China. However, after receiving the contract, the Party Committee sent engineers to the ordering unit to study the design on-site, broke through the technical key, and improved the design structure, so that the impeller could rotate normally at a high temperature of 700 degrees. Various measures were also taken to ensure the completion of the production of this batch of fans. Therefore, the contract task was completed ahead of schedule, ensuring the timely start of the national key project.

　　When leading cadres of this factory go deep into the front line of production, they also pay attention to grasping the product variety and the completion of contract tasks. In May, the factory failed to complete the plan for two days, which would affect the failure to complete the plan for many products according to variety. In response to this situation, the Party Committee members divided the work according to workshops, went deep into the front line, and within a week helped the three main workshops solve 18 key production problems and break through weak links, resulting in over-fulfillment of the product variety plan. In June, after the 20th, the fans produced by the factory were still short of more than 200 units because the motors supplied by other factories could not be matched. The sales staff believed that this problem could not be solved in June. After Party Secretary Tong Enjiang conducted an in-depth investigation and study of this issue, he immediately mobilized all sales staff to find sources of motors everywhere. The Party Secretary also personally took charge of contacting Factory 53, which finally solved the problem of the shortage of motors. As a result, the factory still fully completed the installation and assembly tasks in June.

    沈阳扇风机厂根据全局观点安排计划采取切实措施组织生产
    按时按质按量完成合同产品
    据新华社沈阳3日电　沈阳扇风机厂党委在组织领导生产中，贯彻全国一盘棋的方针，以订货合同的产品为主，按月、按旬、按日、按品种规格，抓生产工作，千方百计地保证完成订货合同规定的任务。今年以来，全厂月月完成了品种计划，同时也全面地完成了其它的指标计划。到现在止，全厂今年已经按合同完成各种鼓风机、通风机六千一百五十七台，基本做到了台台产品不过合同期。在质量方面，全厂目前生产的四十五种类型的风机，已经全部达到了国内最先进的技术水平，其中有些达到了国际先进水平。全厂按期完成合同任务，为由该厂供应风机的全国一百六十多项冶金、煤炭、石油、化工、电力等工程按期和提前投入生产，创造了有利条件。
    这个厂党委在安排计划和组织生产中，都贯彻了先国家后地方、先重点后一般、先计划内后计划外的原则。例如在编制计划时，将国营企业的订货优先安排。在材料、工具的供应等各方面，也优先保证国家合同产品的生产。
    为了使全体干部和职工都重视完成合同任务，党委在加强对职工的教育同时，还将合同任务层层交底，项项落实。他们在编制生产计划时，对合同产品，都加以注明，其中重点产品还加以特殊说明和提出要求。这样就使厂、车间以至工段的负责生产的干部和工人，都对合同产品心中有数。
    在组织生产中，这个厂对合同产品还给以“三先”权，即车间编制作业计划优先编排进度；工段或小组优先投产；优先完成。对国家特别急需的合同产品，以“五让、一不让”的办法来保证完成。“五让”即人力让路、设备让路、材料让路、工具让路、运输让路；“一不让”即不让拖进度。这样就可以调动最大力量打歼灭战，来完成合同任务。如今年支援鞍钢7月以前急需的四十五台风机，技术复杂，制造很困难，在我国从来没制造过。但他们接到合同后，党委就派工程师到订户单位实地研究设计，突破了技术关键，改进了设计结构，使叶轮在七百度高温情况下正常转动。在生产这批风机时，也采取各种措施优先保证完成。因此提前完成了合同任务，保证了国家重点工程的按时开工。
    这个厂的领导干部在深入生产第一线时，也很注意抓产品品种和合同任务完成的情况。5月份这个厂因有两天未完成计划，将影响很多产品不能按品种完成计划。针对这一情况，党委委员按车间进行了分工，深入到第一线，一周内就帮助三个主要车间解决了十八项生产关键，突破了薄弱环节，结果超额完成了产品品种计划。6月份到二十号以后，全厂生产的风机，还缺二百多台需要依靠外厂供应的电机配不上套。供销人员认为6月份根本不能解决这一问题了。党委书记佟恩江深入调查研究了这一问题以后，立即动员全体供销人员四处寻找电机来源。党委书记也亲自挂帅到五三工厂联系，终于使缺少电机的问题得到解决。结果，这个厂在6月份还是全面完成了安装配套任务。
