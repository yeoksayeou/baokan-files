    Leading the Masses to Change the Face of Mountainous Areas, Leading by Example in Practicing Economy
    Yan Keping Carefully Calculates Everything for the Collective
    Under His Influence, Cadres and Masses of the Thirteen陵公社 Commune Promote a New Style of Diligence and Frugality in Running the Commune
    (Reported by this newspaper) Yan Keping, the Party Secretary of the Thirteen陵公社 People's Commune in Changping County, Beijing, took the lead in promoting the hard-working and plain-living style of the Liberation War era, grasping both production increase and economy, being diligent and thrifty, from himself to others, and the whole commune promoted a new style of diligence and frugality in running the commune.
    The Thirteen陵公社 Commune is mostly mountainous, and has always been a grain-deficient area, relying on buying grain to live through the years. Yan Keping was transferred here to work last winter. Under the instructions of the higher party committee, he was determined to "work hard to strengthen himself," leading the cadres and commune members of the whole commune to "fight against the sky and ask the mountains for grain," striving to change the face of the grain-deficient mountainous area as soon as possible. He went deep into the fields, orchards, and canteens, and found that some commune members had the idea of "relying on the mountains to eat the mountains and get immediate benefits," and lacked interest in managing crops. In response to this situation, he and other members of the commune party committee carefully analyzed and studied it, determined that mountainous areas should also take grain as the key link, and decided to carry out propaganda and education among the masses on a large scale in conjunction with spring plowing and sowing, while vigorously developing forestry, animal husbandry and other side occupations, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in food for the whole commune. At the beginning of this year, he led the commune members to first seize the management of 3,000 mu of spring wheat, and finally harvested more than 300,000 jin of wheat on the dry mountain slopes. At the same time, in order to change the situation of less cultivated land in mountainous areas, he mobilized commune members to expand the cultivated land area, and the whole commune set off a production upsurge to advance towards the "ten edges," building ditch edges, opening terraced fields, and expanding the cultivated land area by 7,000 mu on the basis of the original 31,000 mu of cultivated land, and also universally planting high-yield crops such as corn, multi-spike sorghum, and sweet potatoes, and implementing intercropping of forests and grains. During the busy season of spring sowing and summer hoeing, labor was immediately transferred from water conservancy construction sites and commune-run industries to strengthen the grain production front. As a result, spring plowing was completed one or two solar terms earlier than in previous years. Field management was also grasped firmly and meticulously, realizing that there was no wasteland in the whole commune. When the commune members ate the newly harvested wheat from the commune and saw green crops, they said excitedly: "Our commune has such a good person in charge as Secretary Yan, and poor mountains will become surplus grain towns." When Yan Keping led the commune members to implement the policy of taking grain as the key link, he did not relax forestry production. He mobilized commune members to form professional teams to strengthen orchard management, and systematically develop animal husbandry and commune-run industries, striving for an all-round leap forward in various undertakings. Since the beginning of this year, it has been continuously rated as a red flag commune by the Changping County Committee of the Communist Party of China five times.
    While grasping production increase, the Thirteen陵公社 Commune Party Committee also seized on economy. After Yan Keping came to the commune, he found that some production teams bought whatever they saw and lacked a sound financial management system. He led the commune's financial personnel to strengthen economic accounting and formulated the commune's financial expenditure system, stipulating that the current cash of the production team's working capital should not exceed 30 yuan; non-productive expenditures of more than five yuan need to be approved by the commune party committee. In this way, expenditure was controlled and the commune's management level was improved. On the other hand, he used himself as an example and grasped typical cases to continuously conduct ideological education on diligence and frugality in running the commune for cadres and commune members. During spring plowing and production, many production teams proposed to purchase production materials such as manure baskets, manure baskets, bridles, and mating ropes, while the Tailingyuan Production Team instead wove them themselves and used old objects to replace these supplies. Yan Keping organized production team cadres to discuss and study Tailingyuan's practices, mobilized commune members to use wild thorns on the mountain for weaving, which not only did not delay agricultural time but also saved expenses. He grasped non-productive expenditures even more tightly. The commune canteen was built with more than a dozen bamboo poles and an old mat. Some people advocated building a new canteen, but he resolutely disagreed, and said: "What does it matter whether the canteen is good or bad, it's still just eating." These things gave the commune cadres and commune members a great education.
    Because the party secretary took the lead in being diligent and thrifty everywhere, this commune promoted the atmosphere of diligence and frugality in running the commune. From the commune party committee to the production team, many cadres and commune members were conscientious and worked hard. They carefully calculated everything, made do with what they had, and paid attention to saving at all times, regardless of whether it was a big or small matter. When the commune cadres went to the production team, they lived in the homes of the commune members, just like guerrillas during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, and the cadres and the masses got along closely. The Heishanzhai Production Brigade had no place to work and was unwilling to build a new house, squeezing out a few old houses as offices. The commune built pig pens and duck farms, and the commune members tried every means to find ways and build them with local materials. They also saved everywhere in production. When the Tailing Production Brigade built sweet potato kangs, they originally bought 300 jin of hemp rope from the supply and marketing cooperative to prepare for making grass curtains, but the party branch, based on the principle of "not spending money if you can," mobilized commune members to cut kudzu vines on the mountain to replace hemp rope, and returned all the ropes they bought. Then they organized a weaving team to weave fruit baskets themselves, and without spending the commune's expenses, they packed and transported the fruits harvested this year.
    Production has increased, and the income of commune members has increased, but there are few signs of extravagance and waste. Every family is living frugally and carefully, based on the spirit of diligence and thrift in managing the family. Now, most of the commune members have savings. In the first half of this year alone, the commune members saved more than 300,000 yuan. (Attached picture)

    领导群众改变山区面貌　以身作则带头厉行节约
    阎克平精打细算处处为集体
    在他的影响下，十三陵公社干部和群众发扬勤俭办社新风尚
    本报讯　北京市昌平县十三陵人民公社党委书记阎克平，带头发扬解放战争时期的艰苦朴素作风，一手抓增产，一手抓节约，克勤克俭，由己及人，全公社发扬勤俭办社的新风尚。
    十三陵公社境内多山，一向是缺粮地区，常年靠买粮过日子。阎克平从去年冬夭调到这里工乍，在上级党委的指示下，抱定“发奋图强”的决心，领导全社干部、社员“与天斗争，向山要粮”，力争尽快改变山区缺粮的面貌。他深入田间、果园、食堂，发现社员中有“靠山吃山现得利”的思想，对经营庄稼改有兴趣。针对这种情况，他和公社其他党委委员仔细地进行了分析研究，确定山区也要以粮为纲，并决定结合春耕播种在群众中大张旗鼓地进行宣传教育，同时大搞林业、畜牧业和其他副业，力争做到全社口粮自给。今年一开始，他领导全社社员首先抓紧管理好三千亩春小麦，终于在干旱的山坡地上收获了三十多万斤麦子。同时，为了改变山区耕地少的情况，发动社员扩大耕地面积，全公社掀起了向“十边”进军的生产高潮，垒沟沿，开梯田，在原有三万一千多亩耕地面积的基础上，又扩大了七千亩耕地，还普遍栽种玉米、多穗高粱、白薯等高产作物和实行林粮间种。当春播夏锄农忙季节，立即从水利工地和社办工业等方面调出劳力，加强粮食生产战线，结果春耕比往年提早一个多节气完成。田间管理又抓得狠搞得细，实现了全社无荒地。社员们吃上公社新收的麦子，又看到一片片绿油油的庄稼时，都兴奋地说：“咱们社有阎书记这样好的当家人，穷山也会变成余粮乡。”阎克平在领导社员贯彻以粮为纲的方针时，并没有放松林业生产。他发动社员组成了专业队，加强果树管理，并有计划地发展畜牧业和社办工业，力争各项事业全面跃进。今年以来，已连续五次被中共昌平县委评为红旗公社。
    十三陵公社党委在大抓增产的同时，又抓紧节约。阎克平到公社后，发现有的生产队见什么就买什么，缺乏健全的财务管理制度。他就一方面领导公社财务人员，加强经济核算，订出公社财务开支制度，规定生产队流动资金现款不得超过三十元；非生产性开支五元以上，需经公社党委批准。这样，既控制了开支，又提高了公社经营管理水平。另一方面，他以身作则和抓典型事例，不断向干部和社员进行勤俭办社的思想教育。在春耕生产时，许多生产队都提出购买粪箕、粪筐、笼头和套股绳等生产资料，而泰陵园生产队却自编和利用旧物代替这些用品。阎克平就组织生产队干部讨论学习泰陵园作法，发动社员就地取材，用山上野生的荆条进行纺织，既做到不误农时又节约了开支。对于非生产性开支，他抓得更紧。公社食堂是用十多根竹竿和一张旧席搭起来的，有人曾主张盖个新食堂，他坚决不同意，并且说：“食堂的房子好坏有什么要紧，还不是照样吃饭。”这些事情，给社干部和社员很大教育。
    由于党委书记处处带头克勤克俭，这个公社发扬勤俭办社的风气。从公社党委到生产队，许多干部和社员，都兢兢业业，埋头苦干。他们不论办大小事都精打细算，因陋就简，时刻注意节约。公社干部下到生产队时，就住在社员家里，像抗日战争和解放战争时期打游击一样，干部和群众相处得亲密无间。黑山寨生产大队没处办公，也没肯盖一间新房，挤出几间旧房作办公室。公社建猪圈盖鸭场，也都是社员千方百计想办法，就地取材建成的。在生产上也处处节约，泰陵生产大队在搭白薯炕时，本来从供销社买来三百斤麻绳准备打草帘，可是党总支本着
  “能不花钱就不花钱”的原则，发动社员上山砍葛条代替麻绳使用，把买回的绳子全部退回去。接着又组织编织队，自编水果筐，没用公社开支，就把今年收下的水果打包运出去了。
    生产提高了，社员收入增加了，却很少看到铺张浪费的现象。家家都本着勤俭持家的精神，精打细算过日子。现在，这个公社的社员大部分人都有存款。仅今年上半年，全社社员就储蓄了三十多万元。（附图片）
