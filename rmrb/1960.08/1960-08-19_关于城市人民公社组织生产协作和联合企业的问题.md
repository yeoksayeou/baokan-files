    On the Question of Urban People's Communes Organizing Production Collaboration and Joint Enterprises
    Guan Datong
    Under the guidance of the principle of "the whole country as a coordinated chess game," better organizing production collaboration and closely coordinating from all aspects of production are necessary for high-speed development of production. Recently, many urban people's communes have launched a production collaboration movement; some people's communes in some cities (Shenyang, Changchun, etc.) have further developed the work of organizing joint enterprises on the basis of production collaboration, giving new development to production collaboration relations. Organizing joint enterprises within the scope of the commune is to organize enterprises with similar production together, centering on state-owned industry, according to the principle of state-owned leading collective, large leading small, and the combination of large, medium, and small enterprises, to implement joint production. This is a new form of urban people's communes organizing industrial production.
    Urban Communes Organizing Production Collaboration and Joint Enterprises is the Direction of Industrial Production Development
    The current great development of productive forces requires further organization of large-scale production collaboration, better realization of the close combination of state-owned industry and commune industry, large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and indigenous production methods and modern production methods, further tapping the potential of human and material resources, and constantly promoting the high-speed development of industrial production; it requires further efforts to engage in comprehensive utilization and diversified operations, vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution, vigorously march toward high, large, precise, cutting-edge, and new technologies, and better combine the development of large product production with the development of small commodity production, and combine increasing the quantity of products with improving the quality of products. Urban people's communes organizing production collaboration and organizing joint enterprises are born in response to these requirements.
    Urban people's communes are the unified organizers of urban production, and from the beginning, they serve to promote the high-speed development of productive forces. Urban industrial production is a unified whole. Whether it is state-owned industry, which occupies a dominant position in the city, or the numerous commune industries and street industries run by street residents, they all need to be planned in a unified way under the guidance of the principle of "the whole country as a coordinated chess game" to facilitate strengthening the planning of production. In fact, since the establishment and development of urban people's communes, they have played an important role in organizing large-scale production collaboration, and the production collaboration relationship between state-owned industry and commune industry has become increasingly close, enabling commune industry to better serve large industry and market needs. There is no doubt that with the continuous consolidation and development of urban people's communes, their important role as unified organizers of production will be increasingly perfected, which is an inevitable requirement of the development of productive forces.
    Comrade Mao Zedong has long told us that socialist relations of production are not immutable. They are adapted to the development of productive forces, but there is also a contradictory side. This situation of both adaptation and contradiction requires us to constantly adjust and improve the relations of production in the process of productive forces development according to the needs and specific circumstances of productive forces development. The emergence of joint enterprises is not accidental. It is a necessary product of the continuous adjustment of production relations according to the requirements of the great development of productive forces, and it is a necessary product of the urban people's communes further unifying the organization of production and carrying out large-scale production collaboration.
    The joint operation of production is not unique to the socialist economy. In his famous book "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," Lenin pointed out: "A very important feature of capitalism at its highest stage of development is what is called combination, that is, the combination of various branches of industry into one enterprise, some of which sequentially process raw materials (such as smelting ore into pig iron, smelting pig iron into steel, and possibly manufacturing various finished products with steel), and some of which play a supporting role to other departments (processing waste or by-products; producing packaging materials, etc.)." The joint operation of production under the capitalist system promotes the process of production socialization; however, it is still based on capitalist private ownership, which turns competition into monopoly, thereby bringing more profits to monopoly capital. The joint operation of production under our socialist system is fundamentally different in nature. It is based on socialist public ownership and serves to develop socialist construction in a faster, better, and more economical way. With the vigorous development of our socialist construction, joint enterprises will continue to increase. When Comrade Mao Zedong inspected Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation in 1958, he instructed us: "Large enterprises like Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation can gradually be built into comprehensive joint enterprises. In addition to producing a variety of steel products, they should also run some machinery industry, chemical industry, and construction industry, etc." This instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out an important direction for the development of our industrial production. Of course, urban people's communes organizing joint enterprises is still a new thing, and it is not yet perfect. However, this new thing will grow rapidly with the consolidation and development of urban people's communes, gradually become perfect, and play a major role in the construction of our socialist and communist cause.
    Production Collaboration and Joint Enterprises Show Great Superiority
    At present, from the experience of organizing joint enterprises in Shenyang, Changchun, and other places, it can be seen that although the time of its establishment is still very short, it has shown great superiority, proving that this is an organizational form for high-speed development of production.
    First of all, through the production organization form of joint enterprises, the role of urban people's communes in unifying the organization of production has been further brought into play, all positive factors have been better mobilized, and the high-speed development of production has been greatly promoted. The establishment of joint enterprises has transformed the original temporary and unfixed cooperative relations into regular and fixed cooperative relations; labor, equipment, technology, etc. can be better unified, arranged, and mutually supported among the factories under the joint enterprise, thereby greatly changing the past situation of uneven labor busy and idle, and surplus and shortage of equipment and technology among the various factories. After the organization of joint enterprises, the difficulties of insufficient labor force in some state-owned factories have been solved to varying degrees; some idle and unused machinery and equipment in the past have been utilized and put into production; those who could only produce some parts and components in the past can now produce complete sets of products. At the same time, the joint enterprise also organizes the scattered personnel engaged in transportation, repair, and construction in the subordinate factories to establish transportation teams, engineering teams, and various service teams, and concentrates some scattered auxiliary production equipment of various factories to establish comprehensive factories serving various factories. All these have further tapped the potential of human and material resources and promoted the development of production with immediate results.
    Secondly, joint enterprises can plan comprehensively, make unified arrangements, and are more conducive to engaging in comprehensive utilization and developing diversified operations, opening up broad avenues for industrial production, and better implementing the policy of increasing production and practicing economy. Facts have proved that engaging in comprehensive utilization in industrial production has endless potential. Therefore, engaging in comprehensive utilization and diversified operations is an extremely important way to develop industrial production. Especially in the current situation of great production development and relatively tight supply of certain raw materials, engaging in comprehensive utilization and diversified operations is of even greater significance.
    After the establishment of the joint enterprise, it is convenient to plan and use uniformly the scraps, waste residue, waste liquid, and waste gas of the subordinate factories. In this way, it is further possible to make waste non-waste, turn harm into benefit, turn one use into multiple uses, and turn useless into useful, expand the source of raw materials, and increase the variety of products. For example, some small parts produced by the Automobile Parts Factory of Erdaohaozi People's Commune in Changchun City originally only needed to use scraps, but in the past, large materials were often used for small purposes. After the organization of joint enterprises, the scraps of other factories were fully utilized, and 15 kinds of products were successfully trial-produced using waste iron filings, copper filings, and waste acid. This has saved a lot of wealth for the country.
    Third, the establishment of joint enterprises has further promoted the development of technological innovation and technological revolution. In the vigorous technological innovation and technological revolution movement, a climax of large factories helping small factories and state-owned factories helping commune factories has been formed, thus making the mechanization level and labor productivity of commune industry improve very quickly. However, this kind of off-site help is still not frequent and fixed. Judging from the general situation at present, the situation that there are relatively more manual operations, simpler equipment, and lower mechanization levels in commune industry is still quite common. Therefore, commune industry must continue to adopt the method of combining indigenous and modern methods, self-reliance and state-owned industry assistance, to further carry out technological innovation and technological revolution movement and implement technological transformation. After the organization of joint enterprises, due to the further realization of the close combination of large, medium and small enterprises and the strengthening of the help and support of state-owned industry to commune industry, it is possible to concentrate the use of technical forces to break through the key of technological revolution, and advanced experience can be quickly popularized and exchanged. All these have powerfully promoted the development of technological innovation and technological revolution in commune industry. The indigenous gas furnace repaired by the Changchun Automobile Tool Factory is fast and good. The joint enterprise timely organized an advanced experience promotion team, so that many other factories quickly built it; After the state-owned Light Industrial Machinery Factory No. 3 in Shenyang City organized a joint enterprise, it further strengthened its assistance to commune industry, and in a short period of time, it greatly improved the mechanization level of commune industry.
    After the organization of joint enterprises, not only has it accelerated the technological transformation of commune industry, but it has also promoted the development of technological innovation and technological revolution movement in state-owned industry. The strengthening of the technical forces of commune industry enables them to undertake part of the production tasks of state-owned factories, so that some state-owned industries can free up their strength to advance to high, large, precise, cutting-edge, and new industries.
    Fourth, the establishment of joint enterprises is conducive to further improving people's ideological awareness and greatly promoting the communist style. After the organization of joint enterprises, the relationship between large factories and small factories and between state-owned industry and commune industry has become increasingly close, and under unified planning, they support each other; this change in production relations is also reflected in people's ideological consciousness, making people's collectivist thinking increasingly developed, the concept of the overall situation increasingly strengthened, and the spirit of unity and cooperation further developed. "Other people's difficulties are their own difficulties" and "One family has trouble, and ten thousand families help" have become a new atmosphere. Large factories are more active and enthusiastic in helping small factories than in the past, and small factories serve large factories with greater enthusiasm than in the past. When state-owned factories need labor in production, commune industry sends strong labor to support; when the leadership of commune industry is weak and the technical level is low, state-owned factories regularly transfer some outstanding cadres and technicians to help greatly. This has strengthened the leadership of commune industry and improved the production technology level and management level of commune industry.
    Fifth, through joint enterprises, the role of urban people's communes in unifying organizational life has been further strengthened, and the great development of collective welfare undertakings and cultural, educational, and health undertakings has been promoted. Organizing production and organizing life have always been inseparable. The establishment of joint enterprises has organized many factories together in terms of production, which has created good conditions for further development of collective welfare undertakings. The potential of the welfare facilities of various enterprises can be better brought into play, and human, material, and financial resources can be used economically. In this way, collective welfare undertakings and cultural, educational, and health undertakings can be developed better and faster according to the needs of production. Facilities that one unit could not afford to run in the past can now be run.
    From the above, it can be seen that the joint enterprises organized by urban people's communes have great superiority. It not only further promotes the high-speed development of production, but especially has far-reaching significance in that through this production organization form, it better plays the role of urban people's communes in unifying the organization of production and unifying the organization of life, and expands the factors of the urban people's communes' ownership by the whole people, thereby helping to promote the consolidation and development of the urban people's communes.
    Start with Organizing Production Collaboration and Give Full Play to the Role of Urban Communes as Production Organizers
    Starting with organizing production collaboration and gradually strengthening the role of urban people's communes as unified organizers of production is the requirement of the current development of productive forces. However, it should also be seen that there are different types of urban people's communes at present, some established with state-owned industrial and mining enterprises as the center, and some established mainly by street residents, large-scale people's communes with one city or one district as one commune, and small-scale people's communes with one street or several streets as one commune. The relationship between these different types of urban people's communes and state-owned industry is also different, and the role played in organizing production cannot be exactly the same. Therefore, urban people's communes must consider different conditions and adopt a variety of forms in organizing production collaboration. Joint enterprises are a form of organizing production collaboration, and it is a relatively good form. Through this form, enterprises related to production will gradually form a fixed collaboration system on the basis of continuous development of collaboration relations.
    Organizing joint enterprises is an adjustment and improvement of the relations of production according to the requirements of productive forces development, which will inevitably involve a series of complex relations and new problems will arise. Only by correctly handling these relations and problems can we run joint enterprises well, better play its role, and continuously promote the development of this production organization form. At present, there are still enterprises with different ownership systems in urban industry, including state-owned industry owned by the whole people and commune industry basically owned by the collective. Therefore, when these two different ownership systems of enterprises are organized together through the form of joint enterprises, the first problem encountered is: In joint enterprises, how to deal with the relationship between enterprises owned by the whole people and enterprises owned by the collective? After the joint enterprise organizes state-owned industry and commune industry together, it strengthens the leadership of the economy owned by the whole people over the economy owned by the collective, and expands the factors of the commune industry owned by the whole people, which will undoubtedly be conducive to gradually realizing the transition of commune industry from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. However, we know that to realize this transition, it ultimately depends on the level of productive forces development and also depends on the level of ideological awareness of the members of commune industry. At present, because commune industry generally still has a large difference from state-owned industry in the above two aspects, therefore, under this condition, on the one hand, it is necessary to use the form of joint enterprises to develop productive forces at high speed, and at the same time continuously strengthen the socialist and communist education of members of commune industry, to create conditions for the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people; on the other hand, in addition to being organized into "braids" from production and planned in a unified way according to production needs and conditions, joint enterprises should currently adopt the principle of separate accounting of profits and losses and implementing equivalent exchange between ownership by the whole people and collective ownership in finance, and correctly handle related financial problems. After state-owned enterprises participate in joint enterprises, in addition to being led by joint enterprises, they should also be led by higher-level competent departments, and the production plans, product allocation plans, and profit delivery plans stipulated by the state must be guaranteed to be completed; and joint enterprises must also take ensuring that all state-owned factories complete state plans as their primary responsibility.
    After the organization of joint enterprises, commune industry can get more powerful support and help from state-owned industry, and can also better serve state-owned industry. However, it must be pointed out here that, first, after the organization of joint enterprises, commune industry should still implement the policy of self-reliance, making do with whatever is available, combining indigenous and modern methods, and running enterprises diligently and frugally, rather than saying that everything can be counted on the help of state-owned industry, and everything can rely on state-owned industry. Otherwise, it will not only inevitably affect the production of state-owned industry, but also be detrimental to the development of commune industry. Second, after the organization of joint enterprises, in addition to better serving state-owned industry, commune industry should also better serve market needs and agriculture. If, after the organization of joint enterprises, it only pays attention to serving state-owned industry and neglects serving people's lives and agriculture, that is wrong.
    In addition to serving state-owned large industries, urban people's communes should further develop the production of small commodities. Commune industry must serve the people's lives, that is, to produce more and better small commodities according to the growing needs of urban and rural people's lives. We know that the characteristics of producing small commodities are small and scattered, and many of the required raw materials are scraps. Therefore, from the characteristics of commune industry itself, there are favorable conditions for vigorously developing the production of small commodities. In fact, a large part of the production of urban commune industry is the production of small commodities. The rapid development of urban commune industry has added a strong new force for the development of small commodity production. Although the production of small commodities is scattered and trivial, and the output value is relatively low, it is an indispensable part of the entire industrial production and plays an important role in the national economic life. Therefore, urban commune industry must take the development of small commodity production as its major glorious task. After the organization of joint enterprises, it has opened up broad avenues for commune industry to further engage in comprehensive utilization and diversified operations, and the technological innovation and technological revolution movement is being carried out more and more deeply, which provides more favorable conditions for vigorously developing the production of small commodities. In the development of small commodity production, it is necessary to continuously increase varieties and improve quality. It is necessary to prevent and correct the phenomenon of simply pursuing output value, neglecting the production of small commodities, or only paying attention to quantity and neglecting product quality.
    Urban people's communes organize joint enterprises, which are established according to the needs of production development. At present, within the scope of urban people's communes, production collaboration should be vigorously organized, and labor productivity and the management level of enterprises should be continuously improved, and the political and ideological education of enterprise employees and production personnel should be strengthened. This is required by the correct implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction.

    关于城市人民公社组织生产协作和联合企业的问题
    管大同
    在“全国一盘棋”的方针指导下，更好地组织生产协作，从生产的各个方面密切配合起来，这是高速度发展生产所需要的。最近以来，很多城市人民公社开展了生产协作运动；有些城市（沈阳、长春等）的一些人民公社在生产协作的基础上，进一步开展了组织联合企业的工作，使生产协作关系有了新的发展。在公社范围内组织联合企业，就是按照以全民带集体、以大带小、大中小结合的原则，以国营工业为中心，把生产相近的企业组织在一起，实行联合生产。这是城市人民公社组织工业生产的一种新的形式。
    城市公社组织生产协作和联合企业是工业生产发展的方向
    当前生产力的大发展，要求进一步组织生产大协作，更好地实现国营工业和公社工业之间、大型企业和中小型企业之间以及土法生产和洋法生产之间的紧密结合，进一步发挥人力、物力的潜力，不断地促进工业生产的高速度发展；要求进一步大搞综合利用和多种经营，大搞技术革新和技术革命，大力向高、大、精、尖、新进军，更好地把发展大产品生产与发展小商品生产结合起来，把增加产品的数量和提高产品的质量结合起来。城市人民公社组织生产协作和组织联合企业，就是适应于这些要求而产生的。
    城市人民公社是城市生产的统一组织者，它一开始就是为促进生产力的高速度发展服务的。城市工业生产是一个统一的整体，无论是在城市中占统治地位的国营工业，还是为数众多的街道居民举办的公社工业和街道工业，都需要在“全国一盘棋”的方针指导下，统筹安排，以有利于加强生产的计划化。事实上，自从城市人民公社建立和发展以来，在组织生产大协作方面已经发挥了重要的作用，在国营工业和公社工业之间，生产协作关系日益密切，使公社工业更好地为大工业和市场需要服务。毫无疑问，随着城市人民公社的不断巩固和发展，它作为生产统一组织者的重要作用，必将日益完善地发挥出来，这是生产力发展的必然要求。
    毛泽东同志早就告诉我们，社会主义的生产关系，并不是一成不变的东西。它是和生产力的发展相适应的，但是，也还有相矛盾的一面。这种又相适应又相矛盾的情况，就要求我们在生产力发展的过程中，按照生产力发展的需要和具体的情况，对生产关系不断地进行调整和改善。联合企业的产生不是偶然的。它正是根据生产力大发展的要求对生产关系不断地进行调整的必然产物，是城市人民公社进一步统一组织生产和开展生产大协作的必然产物。
    生产的联合化，并不是社会主义经济所独有的东西。列宁在《帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段》这一名著中，就曾指出：“资本主义发展到最高阶段的时候，有一个极重要的特点，就是所谓联合制，即把各种工业部门联合成一个企业，其中有些部门依次对原料加工（如把矿石炼成生铁，把生铁炼成钢，可能还用钢制造各种成品），有些部门对另一些部门起辅助作用（对废物或副产品加工；生产包装用品等等）。”资本主义制度下的生产联合化，促进了生产社会化的过程；但是，它仍然以资本主义私有制为基础，它使竞争变为垄断，从而为垄断资本带来了更多的利润。我国社会主义制度下的生产联合化，在性质上则有着根本的区别，它是以社会主义公有制为基础，是为多快好省地发展社会主义建设服务的。随着我国社会主义建设的蓬勃发展，联合企业将不断增多。毛泽东同志在1958年视察武钢时，曾指示我们说：“像武钢这样的大型企业，可以逐步地办成为综合性的联合企业，除生产多种钢铁产品外，还要办点机械工业、化学工业和建筑工业等。”毛泽东同志这一指示，给我国工业生产指明了一个重要的发展方向。当然，城市人民公社组织联合企业，还是一个新生的事物，目前还很不完善。但是，这个新生事物必将随着城市人民公社的巩固和发展而迅速地成长起来，逐步走向完善，在我国社会主义和共产主义的建设事业中发挥重大的作用。
    生产协作和联合企业显示了巨大的优越性
    目前，从沈阳、长春等地组织联合企业的经验可以看出，它成立的时间虽然还很短，但是，已经显示了很大的优越性，证明这是一种高速度发展生产的组织形式。
    首先，通过联合企业这种生产组织形式，进一步发挥了城市人民公社统一组织生产的作用，更好地调动了一切积极因素，大大促进了生产的高速度发展。联合企业的成立，使原来临时性的、不固定的协作关系，变成为经常性的、固定的协作关系；在联合企业所属各厂之间，劳动力、设备、技术等可以更好地统一安排，互相支援，从而大大改变了过去在各个工厂之间存在的劳动力忙闲不均、设备技术有余有缺的情况。组织联合企业以后，某些国营工厂劳动力不足的困难在不同程度上解决了；有一些过去闲置未用的机器设备利用起来投入生产了；过去只能生产一些部件产品的，现在能够生产成套的产品了。同时，联合企业还把所属各厂一些分散的从事运输、修理、建筑的人员组织起来成立运输队、工程队和各种服务队，把各厂一些零星的辅助性生产设备集中起来，建立了为各厂服务的综合性的工厂。这些，都进一步发挥了人力、物力的潜力，立竿见影地促进了生产的发展。
    其次，联合企业能够全面规划，统筹安排，更有利于大搞综合利用，发展多种经营，为工业生产开辟了广阔的门路，更好地贯彻了增产节约的方针。事实已经证明，在工业生产中大搞综合利用，有着无穷无尽的潜力。因此，大搞综合利用和多种经营，是发展工业生产的一条极其重要的途径。尤其是在当前生产大发展，某些原材料供应比较紧张的情况下，大搞综合利用和多种经营就有着更为重要的意义。
    联合企业成立以后，便于对所属各厂的边角废料、废渣、废液和废气实行统一筹划，合理使用。这样，就进一步做到了废物不废，化害为利，变一用为多用，变无用为有用，扩大了原材料的来源，增加了产品的品种。如：长春市二道河子人民公社汽车配件厂生产的一些小零件，本来只需要利用边角废料，但过去常常是大材小用。组织联合企业以后，充分利用了其他工厂的边角废料，并且还利用废铁屑、铜屑、废酸等试制成功十五种产品。这就为国家节省了大量的财富。
    第三，联合企业的成立，还进一步推动了技术革新和技术革命的发展。在轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动中，形成了一个大厂帮小厂、国营工厂帮公社工厂的高潮，因而使公社工业的机械化程度和劳动生产率提高得很快。但是，这种厂外的帮助仍然是不经常、不固定的。从当前一般情况说来，在公社工业中，手工操作比较多、设备比较简陋、机械化程度比较低的情况仍然相当普遍。因此，公社工业必须继续采取土洋结合，自力更生和国营工业帮助相结合的办法，进一步开展技术革新和技术革命运动，实行技术改造。组织联合企业以后，由于进一步实现了大中小企业之间的密切结合，加强了国营工业对公社工业的帮助和支持，可以集中使用技术力量来突破技术革命的关键，先进经验也能够迅速地得到推广和交流。这些，都有力地推动了公社工业技术革新和技术革命的开展。长春市汽车工具厂修的土煤气炉又快又好，联合企业就及时地组织先进经验推广队，使其他很多工厂都迅速地修建起来；沈阳市国营轻工机械三厂在组织联合企业以后，进一步加强了对公社工业的帮助，在短短的时间内，就使公社工业的机械化程度大大提高。
    组织联合企业以后，不只是加速了公社工业的技术改造，同时也推动了国营工业技术革新和技术革命运动的开展。公社工业技术力量的加强，使它们能够承担起一部分国营工厂的生产任务，从而使某些国营工业能够腾出力量向高、大、精、尖、新进军。
    第四，联合企业的建立，有利于进一步提高人们的思想觉悟，共产主义风格大大发扬。组织联合企业以后，大厂与小厂之间、国营工业与公社工业之间的关系，日益密切，在统一规划之下，互相支援；生产关系的这个变化，也反映到人们的思想意识中来，使人们的集体主义思想日益发扬光大，整体观念日益加强，团结合作的精神进一步发展。“别人的困难就是自己的困难”、“一家有事，万家帮忙”，已经成为一种新风气。大厂对小厂的帮助比过去更积极、更热情，而小厂为大厂服务的劲头也比过去更大更足。国营工厂生产上需要劳动力的时候，公社工业就派出强壮的劳动力去支援；公社工业领导力量较薄弱，技术水平较低，国营工厂就定期抽调一部分优秀的干部和技术工人来大力帮助。这就加强了公社工业的领导力量，提高了公社工业的生产技术水平和经营管理水平。
    第五，通过联合企业，还进一步加强了城市人民公社的统一组织生活的作用，促进了集体福利事业和文教卫生事业的大发展。组织生产和组织生活，从来是不可分割的。联合企业的成立，把许多工厂从生产上组织在一起，这就为进一步发展集体福利事业创造了良好的条件。各个企业的福利设施的潜力能够更好地发挥，人力、物力、财力可以节约使用。这样，集体福利事业和文教卫生事业就可以根据生产的需要，更好更快地发展起来。过去一个单位所无力举办的设施，现在也有条件兴办了。
    由上可见，城市人民公社组织的联合企业，有着巨大的优越性。它不仅进一步促进了生产的高速度发展，尤其具有深远意义的是，通过这种生产组织形式，更好地发挥了城市人民公社的统一组织生产和统一组织生活的作用，并且扩大了城市人民公社的全民所有制因素，从而有利于促进城市人民公社的巩固和发展。
    从组织生产协作入手充分发挥城市公社作为生产组织者的作用
    从组织生产协作入手，逐步加强城市人民公社作为生产统一组织者的作用，是当前生产力发展的要求。但是，还应当看到，当前城市人民公社有着不同的类型，有以国营工矿为中心建立的，也有以街道居民为主建立的，有一市一社或者一区一社的大型人民公社，也有一条街道或者几条街道一社的小型人民公社。这些不同类型的城市人民公社与国营工业的关系也还有所不同，在组织生产方面所发挥的作用也不可能完全相同。因此，城市人民公社组织生产协作，一定要考虑到不同的条件，采取多种多样的形式。联合企业，是组织生产协作的一种形式，并且是一种比较好的形式。通过这种形式，将使生产有关的企业在协作关系不断发展的基础上，逐步形成固定的协作体系。
    组织联合企业，是根据生产力发展的要求对生产关系的调整和改善，这就必然会牵涉到一系列复杂的关系，出现一些新的问题。只有正确地处理这些关系和问题，才能办好联合企业，更好地发挥它的作用，也才能不断地促进这种生产组织形式的发展。目前，在城市工业中，还存在着不同所有制的企业，有全民所有制的国营工业，也有基本上属于集体所有制的公社工业。因此，当通过联合企业的形式把这两种不同所有制的企业组织在一起以后，首先遇到的问题是：在联合企业中，怎样来处理全民所有制企业和集体所有制企业之间的关系？联合企业把国营工业和公社工业组织在一起以后，加强了全民所有制经济对集体所有制经济的领导，扩大了公社工业的全民所有制因素，这无疑地将有利于逐步实现公社工业由集体所有制向全民所有制的过渡。但是，我们知道，要实现这个过渡，归根到底要取决于生产力的发展水平，也取决于公社工业成员的思想觉悟水平。在目前，由于公社工业在上述两个方面与国营工业一般仍然存在着较大的差别，因此，在这种条件下，一方面，必须通过联合企业这种形式，来高速度地发展生产力，同时不断加强对公社工业成员的社会主义和共产主义教育，为实现集体所有制向全民所有制的过渡创造条件；另一方面，联合企业对于所属企业，除了根据生产的需要和条件，先从生产上编成“辫子”、统筹安排以外，在财务上目前仍应采取在全民所有制和集体所有制之间，分别核算盈亏、实行等价交换的原则，正确地处理有关财务的问题。国营企业参加联合企业以后，除了受联合企业的领导以外，同时仍应受上级主管部门的领导，国家规定的生产计划、产品调拨计划和利润上缴计划都必须保证完成；而联合企业也必须把保证所属各国营工厂完成国家计划作为自己的首要责任。
    组织联合企业以后，公社工业可以得到国营工业更有力的支持和帮助，也可以更好地为国营工业服务。但是，在这里还必须指出，第一、组织联合企业以后，公社工业仍然应该贯彻自力更生、因陋就简、土洋结合、勤俭办企业的方针，而不是说，什么都可以指靠国营工业的帮助，事事可以依赖于国营工业了。否则，不仅势必会影响国营工业的生产，同时也不利于公社工业的发展。第二、组织联合企业以后，公社工业除了要更好地为国营工业服务以外，同时也应该更好地为市场需要和农业服务，如果在组织联合企业以后，就只注意为国营工业服务，而忽视为人民生活和为农业服务，那是不对的。
    城市人民公社除了为国营大工业服务以外，还要进一步发展小商品的生产。公社工业要为人民生活服务，就是要根据城乡人民生活的日益增长的需要，来生产更多更好的小商品。我们知道，生产小商品的特点是细小零星，所需的原料很多是边角废料。因此，从公社工业本身的特点来说，就有着大力发展生产小商品的有利条件。事实上，城市公社工业的生产，有很大一部分就是小商品的生产。城市公社工业的迅速发展，为发展小商品的生产增添了一支雄厚的新生力量。小商品的生产虽然零星琐碎，产值也比较低，但它是整个工业生产的不可缺少的组成部分，在国民经济生活中有着重要的作用。因此，城市公社工业必须把发展小商品的生产，作为自己一项重大的光荣任务。组织联合企业以后，为公社工业进一步大搞综合利用和多种经营开辟了广阔的门路，技术革新和技术革命运动正在日益深入地开展，这就为大力发展小商品的生产提供了更为有利的条件。在发展小商品的生产中，要不断地增加品种，提高质量。要防止和纠正那种单纯追求产值，忽视小商品的生产，或者只重视数量，而忽视产品质量的现象。
    城市人民公社组织联合企业，是根据生产发展的需要建立起来的。目前，在城市人民公社的范围内，应该大力组织生产协作，不断地提高劳动生产率，提高企业的管理水平，加强企业从业人员和生产人员的政治思想教育，这是正确贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线所要求的。
