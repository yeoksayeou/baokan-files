Developing the National Economy Must Be Based on Agriculture
Secretary of the Secretariat of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Huang Yan
		
		Agriculture is the Foundation of Human Survival

Developing the national economy based on agriculture is a fundamental issue in socialist economic construction, and it is a primary issue that we must pay attention to at all times.

We know that agriculture is the foundation of human survival. Any society must rely on agriculture to exist and develop. Marx said: "Agricultural labor productivity exceeding the individual needs of the laborer is the foundation of all societies." (Capital, Volume III, page 1025) Comrade Mao Zedong has made many comprehensive discussions on the important position of agriculture in the entire national economy. As early as 1934, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Agricultural production is the first priority in our economic construction work." ("Our Economic Policy") Comrade Mao Zedong has always adhered to this Marxist viewpoint. In the report at the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1945, while comprehensively explaining the importance of peasants in China's political life, he also incisively pointed out agriculture's important position in developing the national economy. During the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, Comrade Mao Zedong, in his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," discussed the necessity of accelerating the development of agricultural production to meet the needs of socialist industrialization, and the necessity of accelerating the realization of agricultural cooperation and gradually completing the technical transformation of agriculture; under China's conditions, there must be cooperation first, and then the use of large machines. Comrade Mao Zedong's thesis on not waiting for mechanization, but first carrying out collectivization to accelerate the development of agricultural production, is a creative development of Marxism-Leninism in the theory of socialist economic construction. In the reports "On the Ten Major Relationships" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Comrade Mao Zedong further elaborated on the important role of agriculture in China's socialist construction, and systematically discussed the relationship between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture. While affirming that China's economic construction is centered on heavy industry, he pointed out that "full attention must be paid to the development of agriculture and light industry," and comprehensively demonstrated that "the development of industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture" and that "heavy industry should take agriculture as an important market." This is another creative development of Marxism-Leninism in the theory of socialist economic construction by Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong's fundamental viewpoints on the importance of agriculture and the relationship between industry and agriculture over the years have played and are continuing to play a great guiding role in China's socialist construction cause.

China is a large agricultural country, with the rural population accounting for more than 80% of the country's total population. Placing agriculture in the primary position is of particular importance. Doing a good job in agriculture is the foothold for our economic construction and the fundamental guarantee for the high-speed development of industry, especially the priority development of heavy industry. Because only with greater development of agriculture can industry be provided with sufficient grain, non-staple food, and raw materials, can more construction funds be directly and indirectly accumulated for industry, can thousands of laborers be transferred to industry, and can a large number of industrial products be absorbed in the vast rural market. Doing a good job in agriculture can enrich the living materials of 650 million people, providing them with more food such as grain, vegetables, and meat, and more clothing and supplies such as cloth and paper. Doing a good job in agriculture is also conducive to further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of revolution and construction. Now we want to advance the worker-peasant alliance to a new stage, which is to rapidly develop agriculture while continuing to develop socialist ownership, accelerate the realization of socialist industrialization and the technical transformation of agriculture, and establish the worker-peasant alliance on a new foundation. All these situations show that the high-speed development of agriculture plays a huge role in the high-speed and proportional development of the entire national economy, and only by developing the national economy based on agriculture can we quickly build China into a strong, prosperous, and happy socialist country.

We deeply realize that leading agricultural production is a very important, arduous, and complex task. This is because agriculture accounts for a large proportion of the entire national economy, the agricultural population is large, the agricultural front is scattered, and agricultural production technology is backward. Moreover, crops are living things, which are strongly affected by natural disasters, and agricultural production is extremely unstable. Taking Anhui Province as an example, in the ten years since liberation, it has encountered eight major natural disasters such as drought, flood, frost, and wind, and even in good years, there is still "scarcity in abundance." Precisely because of this, we have also deeply realized that only by doing a good job in agricultural production can all work be proactive. Over the past ten years, due to our firm implementation of the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and consistently placing agricultural production in the primary position, leading the people of the province to continuously overcome natural disasters, we have achieved great development and a great leap forward in agriculture, thereby promoting the high-speed development of industry and various economic construction undertakings throughout the province.

	Implementation of the Policy and Steps of "Taking Agriculture as the Foundation"

It is certain that the development of the national economy must be based on agriculture. How can we achieve agriculture as the foundation? The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have formulated a series of correct policies and steps based on China's specific conditions.

In order to rapidly develop agriculture, it is necessary to carry out revolutions in both the social system and agricultural technology, and the revolution in the social system must be carried out first. While implementing land reform in China, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong led the peasants across the country to take the road of cooperation in a planned and step-by-step manner. Without waiting for mechanization, cooperation was first realized, followed by the realization of people's communes, fully exerting the power of collectivization and rapidly promoting agricultural production. At the same time, agricultural technical transformation was actively carried out during the cooperation process and since the realization of the people's commune, and it has been gradually developed towards semi-mechanization and mechanization. Following the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, our province, immediately after the land reform, seized the opportunity to implement agricultural cooperation by adopting typical demonstrations and gradually promoting methods without stopping. We resolutely criticized the erroneous idea of waiting for mechanization before implementing cooperation, and actively guided the broad masses of peasants to "organize" to develop agricultural production. In 1951, mutual aid groups with socialist embryonic nature were universally organized in rural areas throughout the province. In 1952, primary agricultural producers' cooperatives of a semi-socialist nature were piloted. In 1953, the Provincial Party Committee resolutely resisted the so-called evil wind of opposing rash advance, sharply proposed that it is necessary to oppose laissez-faire and strengthen the party's leadership over the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and ensured the victorious development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the province. In the first half of 1955, the Provincial Party Committee resolutely resisted the evil wind that the mutual aid and cooperation movement was "doing it too fast," "doing it too big," and "doing it badly," and rejected the erroneous policy of "resolutely shrinking" and "cutting cooperatives," and adhered to the correct policy of the Party Central Committee on the rapid development of the cooperativization movement. In the second half of this year, advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives of a socialist nature were universally organized in the rural areas of the province, completing the historical task of socialist transformation of agriculture in terms of the ownership of the means of production ahead of schedule. In the process of cooperative development, the people of Anhui Province relied on the great power of the mutual aid and cooperation movement to continuously overcome various natural disasters and continuously increase agricultural production. The total grain output of the province in 1952 increased by 98% compared with 1949, and the total grain output in 1955 increased by another 29% compared with 1952. In the process of cooperative development, the broad masses of peasants deeply realized that the collective is better than individual farming, the large collective is better than the small collective, and actively demanded to expand the scale of agricultural cooperatives and merge small cooperatives into large cooperatives. From 1957 to the spring of 1958, a mass movement of merging cooperatives was formed in the vast rural areas of the province, and some places even saw the "four cooperatives merged into one" and "political community merged into one." Therefore, when Comrade Mao Zedong instructed "People's Commune is good" in August 1958, the vast rural areas of the province quickly realized the people's commune in less than two months. After the establishment of the People's Commune, due to the full play of the superiority of "large size and high degree of public ownership," it not only enabled our province to create the miracle of agricultural bumper harvests in 1958 and 1959 under the condition of continuous two years of severe drought, but also effectively guaranteed the leap forward development of the mass campaign for steelmaking by the whole people and other construction undertakings. While leading the people of our province to realize cooperativization and communization, the Provincial Party Committee grasped the technical transformation of agriculture, widely carried out the mass movement of tool reform, and actively created conditions for the realization of agricultural mechanization. It is precisely because we have achieved the development of the entire national economy based on agriculture that the total output value of agricultural production has increased by 3.2 times, industrial production has gone from nothing to something, from small to large, and the total output value has increased by 12.3 times, and other construction undertakings have also been greatly developed accordingly.

In order to rapidly develop agriculture, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out that it is necessary to "take grain as the key link" while actively developing various cash crops; while developing agriculture, it is necessary to develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and achieve simultaneous development of the five industries and comprehensive development. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong also formulated the "Eight-Character Charter" to ensure increased agricultural production. The people of the whole country resolutely implemented these policies and measures, so that China's agricultural production has achieved comprehensive and great development, thereby providing a large amount of raw materials, funds, and markets for industrial development, and powerfully promoting the development of industry and the entire national economy. When Anhui Province implemented the policy of "taking grain as the key link," simultaneously developing the five industries, and comprehensively developing, it formulated a number of key measures with "small investment, big increase in production" based on the characteristics of the province and the experience of the masses, which played a huge role in increasing agricultural production. In 1953, the Provincial Party Committee proposed three reform measures for agricultural production, and continuously enriched and developed the "three reforms" based on new experience. When we implemented the "Eight-Character Charter," based on the past experience of promoting the "three reforms," we proposed that it is necessary to implement it comprehensively and systematically, but also to adapt to local conditions and focus on certain aspects, and determined to focus on vigorously grasping water and fertilizer. In vigorously grasping water conservancy, the Provincial Party Committee, based on many years of water management experience, proposed the policy of "believing in the masses, relying on the masses, focusing on small-scale projects, supporting large and medium-sized projects, focusing on storage, and minimizing drainage," vigorously carrying out river networkization and paddy fieldization in the Huaibei area, and building large reservoir groups and large-scale irrigation gravity flow in mountainous and hilly areas to achieve a combination of flood control, drainage, and irrigation. In vigorously grasping fertilizer, the Provincial Party Committee summarized and promoted the "ten-character method" (smoking, burning, digging, exchanging, sweeping, shoveling, composting, piling, picking up, and fishing) created by the masses for accumulating fertilizer, and further proposed the policy of "combining breeding, planting, accumulation, and production" based on the experience of the masses in accumulating fertilizer. In addition to this, we have also done a lot of work in implementing soil, seeds, density, protection, tools, and management. Because the Provincial Party Committee led the people of the province to take these key measures in developing agricultural production, our province was able to increase production despite disasters, and even increase production despite major disasters. Under the policy of "taking grain as the key link," we also grasped the development of various economies such as cotton, oil, tobacco, tea, and hemp, so that the output of these crops has also increased rapidly; at the same time, we also grasped the production of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, so that the vast rural areas of the province have appeared everywhere with a prosperous scene of "the five industries thriving and the six animals flourishing." Due to the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, not only has it guaranteed the needs of the people in urban and rural areas throughout the province, but it has also powerfully promoted the advancement of industry and the entire national economy. Facts have proved that as long as we resolutely implement "taking grain as the key link" and simultaneously developing the five industries, we can promote the comprehensive upsurge of agricultural production. The faster agriculture develops, the more solid the foundation of the national economy will be, and the more we can let go and engage in economic construction.

In China's economic construction, placing agriculture in the primary position and developing the national economy based on agriculture does not exclude the priority development of heavy industry. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have correctly grasped the laws of socialist economic development, made correct arrangements for the relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry in China, and stipulated the policy that industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry must be carried out simultaneously. In the process of implementing this policy, we deeply realized that the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture are not mutually exclusive, but are mutually conditional, mutually combined, and mutually promoting. To realize socialist industrialization, we must give priority to the development of heavy industry, which is certain. The question is not whether to give priority, but how to give priority, and on what basis to give priority. Relaxing the central link of rapidly developing agriculture and emphasizing the priority development of heavy industry in isolation will not only fail to realize the priority development of heavy industry, but will also hinder the development of the entire national economy. Only on the basis of the rapid development of agriculture can we promote the rapid growth of light industry and fundamentally guarantee the priority development of heavy industry; at the same time, only the rapid development of heavy industry can accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture and guarantee the more rapid development of agriculture. The great leap forward of our province in the past two years clearly illustrates this problem. Because we resolutely implemented the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture instructed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, we insisted on grasping agriculture with one hand and industry with the other even when making steel in a big way, and achieved a common leap forward in industry and agriculture. In 1958, the agricultural output value increased by 22.2%, and industry increased by 94%, of which heavy industry increased by 1.97 times; in 1959, agriculture increased by 16.4%, and industry increased by 54.6%, of which heavy industry increased by 83.7%. The development of heavy industry has also promoted the great development of agriculture. In 1958 and 1959, our province achieved great agricultural harvests under severe drought conditions, which was inseparable from the heavy industry providing a large number of drainage and irrigation machines and various production materials. In 1960, our province also actively built "small foreign groups" of chemical fertilizers, and manufactured more drainage and irrigation equipment and agricultural machinery to support agriculture. It can be seen that the rapid development of heavy industry has created conditions for the rapid development of agriculture.

	Organizing All Walks of Life to Support Agriculture

Since the development of the national economy must be based on agriculture, vigorously supporting agriculture has become the responsibility of all departments. Over the years, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, all departments and units in Anhui Province have consistently attached importance to the work of supporting agriculture, the view that all walks of life serve agriculture is relatively firm, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and workers for supporting agriculture is extremely high. However, sometimes in a few units, some people have insufficient understanding of the great significance of supporting agriculture. They either regard supporting agriculture as an "extra burden," believing that this is only the business of departments directly serving agriculture, not their own business; or they believe that their own strength is weak, equipment is insufficient, and supporting agriculture will affect their own development; some believe that the production and supply of agricultural production materials not only have low output value, low profits, and high labor costs, but also some things are scattered and troublesome, and the plan is not easy to arrange. In order to solve these problems, we have continuously grasped political and ideological work. Through various ways, such as organizing learning, visits, and worker-peasant get-togethers, we have carried out education repeatedly in a planned manner, so that they can recognize the important position of agriculture in the national economy and the close relationship between supporting agriculture and developing the entire national economy and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, basically overcoming incorrect understanding, opening their eyes, understanding that supporting agriculture is their own glorious responsibility, and completing the task of supporting agriculture as a primary task. Of course, under certain new circumstances, some new ideological problems may also arise, and we must continue to strengthen political and ideological work to ensure the thorough realization of the Party's policy of agriculture as the foundation.

Organizing all walks of life to support agriculture is not only a major political task, but also an arduous economic organization task.

In order to do a good job in supporting agriculture, we first attach importance to strengthening the leading force on the front line of agricultural production. In recent years, we have planned to transfer a large number of leading backbones from various departments every year, continuously enriching the leadership of the front line of production, especially strengthening the leadership of backward areas, which has played a major role in promoting the development of agricultural production. For example, Wuhe County transferred a large number of outstanding cadres to production teams to serve as branch secretaries and production team leaders, and in just one year last year, it rapidly changed the face of 80% of the backward teams. Recently, in order to better implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, the Provincial Party Committee has further transferred a large number of leading backbones who have been tested in struggle, have practical work experience, and have a high political level, and a large number of outstanding cadres with good thinking and good style to the countryside to strengthen the front line of production. 50% of the cadres were transferred from the provincial government agencies, and 60% to 70% of the cadres were also transferred from local and county government agencies directly to production teams, especially to backward production teams to serve as branch secretaries or production team leaders, directly leading production, eating, living, working, and discussing with commune members. The time is one year, two years or more, until the ideology, production, and life of the production team are fully improved (50% of the cadres in the industrial and transportation departments are transferred to factories and mines). This transfer is larger in scale and longer in time than in any previous year. Taking this approach can not only better implement the Party's policies, greatly strengthen the work of production teams, make advanced teams more advanced, and make backward teams quickly change their appearance and advance side by side with advanced teams; it can also better train cadres, earnestly improve their style, effectively overcome bureaucracy, and promote the vigorous development of agricultural production.

In order to do a good job in supporting agriculture, we have made unified planning and comprehensive arrangements for the projects, tasks, etc. of various industries to support agriculture. We stipulate that all departments, while completing and overfulfilling national tasks, should organize all possible forces to support agriculture according to their own characteristics and in combination with the urgent needs of agriculture. In recent years, industrial departments in our province have done a lot of work in manufacturing various agricultural machinery, producing chemical fertilizers, and training technical personnel for rural areas. In the year and a half from January last year to June this year, they have supported rural people's communes with 2,127 sets of various agricultural machinery and 6.06 million pieces of various tools, and helped communes set up 9,033 various factories (stations) and trained 33,200 various technical personnel. The transportation departments have promptly transported the means of production and daily industrial products needed by rural areas to rural areas, and promptly transported agricultural and sideline products out. In the past year or so, they have helped rural areas to build earthen railways and use more vehicles and ships, which has greatly developed rural short-distance transportation. The financial and trade departments have promptly done a good job in the supply of production and living materials, delivered goods to the door, and purchased goods at the door; reasonably allocated funds for agricultural production; and helped communes train a large number of financial and accounting personnel and gradually establish an economic accounting system. The departments of culture, education, health, and scientific research have also made significant achievements in developing rural education, eliminating pests and diseases, and solving some scientific and technological problems in agricultural production. The political and legal departments resolutely fought against various bad elements in rural areas, greatly consolidated rural security, and ensured the normal progress of agricultural production. The troops stationed in the province have carried forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army and provided strong support for water conservancy construction, drought resistance, flood prevention, rush harvesting and planting, pest elimination, and rural transportation.

In order to do a good job in supporting agriculture, we have closely combined large-scale sudden support with planned regular support. In our province, in the movements of large-scale water conservancy construction, drought resistance and flood prevention, the annual busy farming season, and cooperativization and communization, there have been continuous upsurges of large-scale support for agriculture. Each time, hundreds of thousands or even one to two million government cadres, factory and mine workers, urban residents with labor capacity, teachers and students went deep into the countryside to help rural areas develop production and construction undertakings. This kind of sudden support that has been available every year is closely combined with the regular support of various departments. Since this year, we have summarized the experience of urban-rural pairing, factory-community pairing, and fixed connection that have been implemented in many places in the past few years, and further established a system of dividing areas and contracting, and fixed pairing. For example, Hefei City is responsible for supporting the three counties in the city and the counties in Lu'an Prefecture, Huainan City supports the counties in Fuyang Prefecture, and Bengbu City supports the counties in Bengbu Prefecture. All localities, cities, and counties have formulated specific plans to link each commune with a factory, and some are also linked with government agencies and schools. It is also stipulated that the focus of support should be placed on the backward communes and teams that have more difficulties and are prone to disasters, truly achieving "sending charcoal in the snow." In the work of supporting agriculture, we have adhered to the principle of "equal exchange," which is conducive to factories and communes implementing economic accounting systems and to the normal development of industrial and agricultural production.

	Reasonable Arrangement of Labor Force, Strive to Improve Productivity

In order to comprehensively promote the development of agricultural production, the unified and reasonable arrangement of the rural labor force and the effort to improve agricultural labor productivity in every possible way is an outstanding issue. In solving this problem, we first planned to control the labor force required by industries above the county level, and implemented the policy of increasing production without increasing people, or even increasing production and reducing people in industry. For example, in 1959, the industrial output value increased by 53% compared with 1958, and the number of people decreased by 400,000, most of whom were transferred to rural areas. In the rural people's communes, specific arrangements have also been made for the labor force. It is stipulated that the labor force occupied by the commune-owned economy should not exceed 5% of the agricultural labor force. During the busy farming season, the labor force in the commune-owned economy, except for those who directly serve agricultural production, should be transferred to agricultural production as much as possible; rural welfare undertakings—mainly canteens—currently require that each cook can cook meals for at least 100 people, and kindergartens in principle do not occupy the entire labor force; agricultural middle schools are also developed in a planned manner without affecting the arrangement of agricultural production labor force. All this can ensure that the vast majority of the rural labor force is used for agricultural production. In terms of improving agricultural labor productivity, we advocate reasonable layout. For example, building field cellars and field pig farms can accumulate fertilizer and apply fertilizer locally, reduce round-trip transportation, and save labor; and some pig farms and biogas stations and agricultural and sideline product processing plants are combined, which not only saves labor but also makes full use of material resources. In improving labor productivity, various places also continue to pay attention to improving labor organization. For example, according to different production tasks, technologies, and other conditions, divide work areas, organize professional teams, reasonably organize labor, and implement fixed staff and quotas. Various work areas and professional teams, without affecting their own production, carry forward the communist style in accordance with the principle of equal exchange, and vigorously carry out collaboration, implementing taking leisure to help the busy, taking more to help less, and taking strength to help the weak. In improving labor productivity, various places have even more enthusiastically and continuously launched a mass movement to reform tools. Reform is carried out comprehensively from water conservancy, farming, harvesting, rural short-distance transportation, agricultural and sideline product and feed processing to cooking tools, etc. During the busy farming season, we organize a large number of labor forces in cities to go to rural areas. In short, we have made comprehensive and reasonable arrangements for the labor force required for agricultural production, and in the spirit of "small investment, big increase in production," we have tried every means to tap labor potential and actively provide the labor needs for agricultural production by adopting the method of gathering fur into a robe. This has played a major guarantee role in realizing the sustained leap forward in agricultural production.

China's agricultural production has made tremendous progress since the founding of the country, especially since the Great Leap Forward. The speed of development is unprecedented and beyond the reach of all capitalist countries. But we must also see that at present, China's agriculture is mainly handicraft production, the technology is still relatively backward, and labor productivity is not high. The fundamental way to solve this problem is to further consolidate and develop the people's commune while accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture, gradually realizing agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification, greatly improving agricultural labor productivity, and greatly increasing the output of agricultural and sideline products, so that agriculture, the foundation of the national economy, can be continuously developed and strengthened. In order to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture and realize the grand goal of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification, the people of our province must make their best efforts to strive to comprehensively develop machine operation in agricultural production in a planned and step-by-step manner in the next few years, so that the main links such as cultivation, sowing, drainage and irrigation, harvesting, processing, and transportation are mechanized; to thoroughly realize river networkization and water conservancy; to ensure that all commune industries use electricity and most of the drainage and irrigation power use electricity; at the same time, we should also greatly increase the use of chemical fertilizers in accordance with the requirements of reasonable fertilization. Only in this way can we fundamentally change the backward technical situation of agriculture in our province and realize agricultural modernization.

To develop agricultural production as soon as possible and further implement the policy of agriculture as the foundation, we must continue to strengthen the Party's leadership and carry out mass movements on a large scale. At present, the people's communes throughout the province have been further consolidated and developed, the economic strength of the communes has become more abundant, and the industrial and other economic departments throughout the province have achieved high-speed development. In particular, we have implemented the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and the political awareness of the people throughout the province has been greatly improved. All this has provided extremely favorable conditions for our province to achieve a sustained leap forward in agricultural production. We must continue to hold high the banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, fully utilize these favorable conditions, realize a greater leap forward in agriculture, and promote the sustained and high-speed development of industry and the entire national economy.

    发展国民经济必须以农业为基础	中共安徽省委书记处书记　黄岩
            农业是人类生存之本
    发展国民经济要以农业为基础，是社会主义经济建设中的一个根本问题，是我们在任何时期都必须重视的首要问题。
    我们知道，农业是人类生存之本，任何一种社会，都必须依赖于农业，才能存在和发展；马克思说：“超越于劳动者个人需要的农业劳动生产率，是一切社会的基础。”（《资本论》第三卷一○二五页）关于农业在整个国民经济中的重要地位，毛泽东同志曾经有过多次的全面的论述。早在1934年，毛泽东同志就指出：“农业生产是我们经济建设工作的第一位。”（《我们的经济政策》）毛泽东同志一直坚持着这个马克思主义的论点。在1945年党的第七次全国代表大会的报告中，他在全面地阐明农民在我国政治生活中的重要性的同时，又精辟地指明了农业在发展国民经济中的重要地位。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，毛泽东同志在《关于农业合作化问题》的报告中，论述了必须加速农业生产的发展以适应社会主义工业化发展的需要，必须加速实现农业合作化和逐步完成农业技术改造；在我国的条件下，必须先有合作化，然后才能使用大机器。毛泽东同志关于不等待机械化、首先进行集体化以加速发展农业生产的论点，是对马克思列宁主义在社会主义经济建设理论上的一个创造性的发展。在《关于十大关系》和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的报告中，毛泽东同志进一步地阐明了农业在我国社会主义建设中的重要作用，系统地论述了重工业、轻工业、农业之间的关系。他在肯定我国经济建设以重工业为中心的同时，指出“必须充分注意发展农业和轻工业”，全面论证了“发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举”、“重工业要以农业为重要市场”。这是毛泽东同志对马克思列宁主义在社会主义经济建设理论上的又一个创造性的发展。毛泽东同志多年来关于农业重要性、关于工农业关系的根本论点，对于我国的社会主义建设事业，已经发挥了并正在继续发挥着伟大的指导作用。
    我国是一个农业大国，农村人口占了全国人口的80％以上，把农业放在首要地位，具有特殊重要的意义。搞好农业，是我们进行经济建设的立脚点，是高速度地发展工业、特别是优先发展重工业的根本保证。因为只有农业的更大发展，才可能为工业提供充足的粮食、副食品和原料，才可能直接和间接地为工业积累更多的建设资金，才可能为工业输送千千万万的劳动力，并在幅员广阔的农村市场中吸收大量的工业产品。搞好农业，就能使六亿五千万人民的生活资料日益丰富，有更多的粮食、蔬菜、肉类等吃的东西，有更多的布匹、纸张等穿的和用的东西。搞好农业，还有利于工农联盟的进一步巩固。在工人阶级领导下的工农联盟，是革命、建设胜利的根本保证。现在我们要把工农联盟推进到一个新的阶段，这就是在继续发展社会主义所有制的同时，迅速发展农业，加速实现社会主义工业化和农业的技术改造，把工农联盟建立在新的基础上。这一切情况表明，农业的高速度发展，不仅对整个国民经济的高速度按比例发展起着巨大作用，而且只有以农业为基础来发展国民经济，才能迅速地把我国建设成为一个强大、繁荣、幸福的社会主义国家。
    我们深深体会到：领导农业生产是一项十分重要而又艰巨复杂的任务。这是因为：农业在整个国民经济中占有很大比重，农业人口众多，农业战线分散，农业生产技术落后；农作物又是有生命的东西，它强烈地受着自然灾害的影响，农业生产极不稳定，拿安徽省解放以来的十年来说，就遇到了八次较大的旱、涝、霜、风等自然灾害，即使在好的年成里，也是“丰中有歉”。正因为如此，也使我们深刻地体会到：只有搞好农业生产，一切工作才能主动。十年来，由于我们坚决贯彻了党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，一贯把农业生产放在首要地位，领导全省人民不断战胜自然灾害，才取得了农业的大发展、大跃进，从而促进了全省工业和各项经济建设事业的高速度发展。
      贯彻“以农业为基础”的方针和步骤
    发展国民经济必须以农业为基础，这是肯定的。怎样才能实现以农业为基础呢？党中央和毛泽东同志根据我国的具体条件，制订了一系列的正确方针和步骤。
    为了迅速地发展农业，必须进行社会制度和农业技术这两个方面的革命，而且首先要进行社会制度方面的革命。我国在实行土地改革的同时，党中央和毛泽东同志就有计划、有步骤地领导全国农民走合作化的道路，不等待机械化，首先实现了合作化，紧接着又实现了人民公社化，充分地发挥了集体化的力量，迅速地促进了农业生产；同时，在合作化过程中和实现人民公社化以来，都积极地进行了农业技术改造，并使之逐步向半机械化、机械化方向发展。遵照党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，我省紧接着土地改革以后，就趁热打铁，不停顿地采取典型示范、逐步推广的方法实行农业合作化。我们坚决批判了等待机械化而后才实行合作化的错误思想，积极引导广大农民“组织起来”发展农业生产。1951年，全省农村中普遍地组织了带有社会主义萌芽性质的互助组，1952年试办了半社会主义性质的初级农业合作社。1953年，省委坚决顶住了所谓反对急躁冒进的歪风，尖锐地提出必须反对放任自流，加强了党对互助合作运动的领导，保证了全省互助合作运动的胜利发展。1955年上半年，省委又坚决顶住了所谓互助合作运动“搞快了”“搞大了”“搞糟了”的一股阴风，拒绝了“坚决收缩”“砍合作社”的错误方针，坚持了党中央关于合作化运动迅速发展的正确方针；这一年的下半年，全省农村就普遍组织起社会主义性质的高级农业合作社，提前完成了在生产资料所有制方面农业社会主义改造的历史任务。在合作化发展过程中，安徽省人民依靠互助合作运动的巨大力量，连续战胜了各种自然灾害，使农业生产不断增长。1952年全省粮食总产量比1949年增长了98％，1955年粮食总产量比1952年又增长了29％。在合作化发展过程中，广大农民群众深刻地认识到：集体比单干好，大集体比小集体好，积极要求扩大农业社的规模，把小社并成大社。从1957年到1958年春这一段时间内，全省广大农村形成了群众性的并社运动，有的地方还出现了“四社合一”和“政社合一”，所以，当1958年8月毛泽东同志指示“人民公社好”以后，全省广大农村在不到两个月的时间内，就迅速地实现了人民公社化。人民公社成立后，由于充分发挥了“一大二公”的优越性，不仅使我省在1958年、1959年连续两年大旱情况下创造了农业大丰收的奇迹，并有力地保证了全民大办钢铁运动和其他各项建设事业的飞跃发展。省委在领导我省人民实现合作化、公社化的同时，抓紧了农业的技术改造，广泛开展了工具改革的群众运动，并积极为实现农业机械化创造条件。正由于我们做到了以农业为基础来推动整个国民经济的发展，十年来，就使农业生产总值提高了三点二倍，工业生产从无到有，从小到大，生产总值提高了十二点三倍，其他各项建设事业也都相应地得到了巨大发展。
    为了迅速地发展农业，党中央和毛泽东同志明确指出：必须“以粮为纲”，同时积极发展各种经济作物；在发展农业的同时，必须发展林业、牧业、副业、渔业，做到五业并举，全面发展。党中央和毛泽东同志还制订了保证农业增产的“八字宪法”。全国人民坚决贯彻了这些方针和措施，使得我国的农业生产获得了全面的、巨大的发展，从而为工业的发展提供了大量的原料、资金和市场，有力地推动了工业和整个国民经济的发展。安徽省在贯彻“以粮为纲”，五业并举，全面发展的方针时，根据本省的特点和群众的经验，制订了若干“花力小、增产大”的关键性措施，对农业增产发挥了巨大作用。1953年，省委提出了农业生产的三项改革办法，并不断根据新的经验，对“三改”办法加以充实和发展。我们在执行“八字宪法”时，根据过去推行“三改”的经验，提出了既要全面、系统地加以贯彻，又要因地制宜，有所侧重，确定了以大抓水、肥为中心。在大抓水利方面，省委根据多年治水经验，提出了“相信群众，依靠群众，小型为主，大中支持，以蓄为主，尽量少排”的方针，在淮北地区大搞河网化，水稻化，在山区、丘陵区大修水库群，大搞灌溉自流化，做到防洪、排涝、灌溉三结合。在大抓肥料方面，省委总结和推广了群众创造的积肥“十字办法”（熏、烧、挖、换、扫、铲、沤、堆、拾、捞），并根据群众的积肥经验，又进一步提出了“养、种、积、制并举”的方针。除此以外，我们在贯彻土、种、密、保、工、管等方面，也做了许多工作。由于省委领导全省人民在发展农业生产方面，采取了这些关键措施，使我省做到了有灾能增产，即使大灾也能增产。在“以粮为纲”的方针下，我们又抓紧了棉、油、烟、茶、麻等多种经济的发展，使这些作物的产量也有了迅速增长；同时又抓紧了林业、牧业、副业、渔业的生产，使全省广大农村中到处出现了“五业俱兴，六畜兴旺”的繁荣景象。由于农林牧副渔全面发展，不仅保障了全省城乡人民生活需要，而且有力地推动了工业和整个国民经济事业的向前迈进。事实证明：只要坚决实行“以粮为纲”，五业并举，就能促进农业生产的全面高涨，农业的发展愈快，国民经济的基础愈坚实，我们就更能够放手大搞经济建设。
    在我国经济建设中，把农业放在首要地位，以农业为基础来发展国民经济，并不排斥重工业的优先发展。党中央和毛泽东同志正确地掌握了社会主义经济发展的规律，对于我国农业、轻工业、重工业之间的关系，作了正确的安排，并规定了工业与农业、重工业与轻工业必须同时并举的方针。我们在执行这个方针的过程中，深刻地认识到优先发展重工业与迅速发展农业，并不是互相对立的，而是互为条件、互相结合、互相促进的。我们要实现社会主义工业化，必须优先发展重工业，这是肯定的。问题不在于要不要优先，而在于怎样优先，在什么基础上的优先。放松了迅速发展农业的这一中心环节，去孤立地强调优先发展重工业，其结果，不仅不能实现重工业的优先发展，而且还会妨碍整个国民经济的发展。只有在农业迅速发展的基础上，才能促进轻工业的迅速增长，才能从根本上保证重工业的优先发展；同时，也只有重工业的迅速发展，才能加速农业的技术改造，才能保证农业更迅速地发展。我省两年来的大跃进清楚地说明了这个问题。由于我们坚决执行了党中央和毛泽东同志指示的工农业同时并举的方针，就是在大办钢铁时，也坚持了一手抓农业，一手抓工业，做到了工农业共同跃进。1958年农业产值增长了22.2％，工业增长了94％，其中重工业增长了1.97倍；1959年农业增长了16.4％，工业增长了54.6％，其中重工业增长了83.7％。重工业的发展，又促进了农业的大发展。1958年和1959年，我省都是在严重干旱情况下取得了农业的大丰收，这是与重工业提供大量排灌机械和各种生产资料分不开的。1960年我省又积极建设化肥“小洋群”，并制造更多的排灌设备、农业机械等来支援农业。可见，重工业的迅速发展又为农业的迅速发展创造了条件。
              组织各行各业支援农业
    发展国民经济既然要以农业为基础，因此，大力支援农业，就成为一切部门应尽的责任。历年来，在省委的领导下，安徽省各部门、各单位对于支援农业的工作是一贯重视的，各行各业为农业服务的观点是比较牢固的，广大干部和职工群众对于支援农业的热情是极高的。但是，有的时候在少数单位中，也曾有一些人对于支援农业的重大意义认识不足。他们或者把支援农业看成“额外负担”，认为这仅是直接为农业服务部门的事，不是自己分内的事；或者认为自己力量薄弱，设备不足，再要支援农业，会影响本身发展；有的则认为生产和供应农业生产资料，不但产值小、利润低、费工大，而且有些事情零星麻烦，计划不好安排。为了解决这些问题，我们不断地抓紧了政治思想工作。通过各种各样的方式，如组织学习、参观、访问，进行工农联欢等等，有计划地反复地进行教育，使他们认识到农业在国民经济中的重要地位，认识到支援农业对发展整个国民经济、对巩固工农联盟的密切关系，基本上克服了不正确的认识，使他们打开了眼界，懂得了支援农业就是自己分内的光荣职责，把支援农业当作首要任务来完成。当然，在某种新的情况下，也还可能产生一些新的思想问题，我们必须继续加强政治思想工作，保证党的以农业为基础的方针彻底实现。
    组织各行各业支援农业，既是一项重大的政治工作，又是一项繁重的经济组织工作。
    为了做好支援农业的工作，我们首先重视加强农业生产第一线的领导力量。几年来，我们每年都有计划地从各部门抽调了大批领导骨干，不断地充实生产第一线的领导、特别是加强后进地区的领导，这对促进农业生产的发展起了重大的作用。如五河县下放了大批优秀干部到生产队去担任支部书记、生产队长，仅去年一年时间，就使80％的后进队迅速改变了面貌。最近，为了更好地贯彻以农业为基础的方针，省委进一步把大批久经斗争考验、有实际工作经验、有较高政治水平的领导骨干，把大批思想好、作风好的优秀干部，下放到农村，加强生产第一线。从省直机关中抽调了50％的干部，各地、县机关也抽调了60％到70％的干部一直下放到生产队、特别到后进生产队去担任支部书记或生产队长，直接领导生产，与社员同吃同住同劳动同商量。时间在一年、二年以上，一直到把生产队的思想、生产、生活全面搞好为止（工、交部门则抽调50％干部到厂矿企业去）。这次下放，规模之大，时间之长，超过以往任何一年。采取这种做法，既能更好地贯彻党的政策，大大加强生产队的工作，使先进队变得更先进，使后进队迅速改变面貌、与先进队并肩前进；又能很好地锻炼干部，认真改进作风，切实克服官僚主义，促进农业生产的蓬勃发展。
    为了做好支援农业的工作，我们对各行各业支援农业的项目、任务等，进行了统一规划，全面安排。我们规定各个部门在完成和超额完成国家任务的同时，都要根据自己的特点，结合农业中的迫切需要，组织一切可以组织的力量支援农业。几年来，我省工业部门在制造各种农业机械、生产化肥、为农村培训技术人材等方面做了许多工作。从去年1月到今年6月的一年半中，就支援了农村人民公社各种农业机械二千一百二十七台，各种工具六百零六万件，并帮助公社办起了各种工厂（站）九千零三十三个，培训了各种技术力量三万三千二百人。交通运输部门曾及时把农村所需的生产资料和日用工业品运到农村，及时把农副产品运出来，最近一年多来又帮助农村大搞土铁路，大搞多用车、多用船，大大发展了农村的短途运输。财贸部门及时做好了生产和生活资料的供应，做到了送货上门，登门收购；对农业生产资金进行了合理分配；并帮助公社培训了大批财务会计人员，逐步建立了经济核算制度。文教、卫生和科学研究部门，在发展农村教育事业、除害灭病、解决农业生产上的一些科学技术问题等方面，成绩也很显著。政法部门在农村中坚决地向各种坏分子作斗争，大大巩固了农村治安，保证了农业生产的正常进行。在省内的驻军，发扬了人民解放军的优良传统，对兴修水利、抗旱、防汛、抢收抢种、消灭虫害、农村运输等作了有力的支援。
    为了做好支援农业的工作，我们把大规模的突击性支援和有计划的经常性支援密切结合起来。我省在大兴水利、抗旱防汛、每年农忙季节及合作化、公社化等运动中，曾不断地掀起了大规模支援农业的高潮，每次抽调了几十万以至一二百万机关干部、厂矿职工、有劳动能力的城镇居民、教职员和学生深入农村，帮助农村发展生产建设事业。这种历年都有的突击性支援，与各部门的经常性支援是密切结合的。今年以来，我们又总结了过去几年中许多地方已经实行的城乡挂钩、厂社挂钩、固定联系的经验，进一步建立了划片包干、固定挂钩的制度。如合肥市负责支援本市三个县及六安专区各县，淮南市支援阜阳专区各县，蚌埠市支援蚌埠专区各县等。各地、市、县都已制订了具体规划，使每个公社都和工厂挂钩，有的还和机关、学校挂钩。并规定了支援重点是放在困难多、容易受灾的后进社、队，真正做到“雪中送炭”。在支援农业的工作中，我们坚持贯彻了“等价交换”的原则，这就有利于厂、社执行经济核算制度，有利于工农业生产的正常发展。
          合理安排劳力，努力提高生产率
    为了全面促进农业生产的发展，统一地合理地安排农村劳动力和千方百计地提高农业劳动生产率，是一个突出的问题。在解决这个问题时，我们首先对县以上工业所需要的劳动力，有计划地加以控制，在工业中实行增产不增人，甚至增产又减人。如1959年工业产值比1958年增长53％，人员减少四十万，其中大部分转入了农村。在农村人民公社中，对劳动力也作了具体安排，规定社有经济所占劳动力，不超过农业劳动力的5％，而在农忙季节，社有经济中除了直接为农业生产服务者外，其他劳动力尽量抽调出来投入农业生产；农村的生活福利事业——主要是食堂，目前要求每个炊事员至少能做一百人的饭菜，幼儿园原则上不占用整劳动力；农业中学也是在不影响农业生产劳动力安排的原则下有计划地发展。这一切，就能保证农村中绝大部分劳动力用到农业生产上去。在提高农业劳动生产率方面，我们提倡合理布局。如搞田头窖，办田头猪场，能够就地积肥，就地施肥，减少往返运输，节省劳动力；又如有些养猪场和沼气站以及农副产品加工厂结合起来，既节省了劳动力，又充分利用了物力。在提高劳动生产率上，各地还不断注意改进劳动组织。如按照生产任务、技术等不同情况，划分作业区，组织专业队，合理组织劳动力，实行定员定额。各个作业区、专业队之间，在不影响本身生产情况下，按照等价交换的原则，发扬了共产主义风格，大力开展协作，实行以闲济忙，以多济少，以强济弱。在提高劳动生产率上，各地更热火朝天地、持续不断地掀起了大搞工具改革的群众运动。从水利、耕作、收割、农村短途运输、农副产品和饲料加工以至炊事工具等等，全面地进行改革，在农忙季节，我们就组织城市中的大批劳动力到农村中去。总之，我们对农业生产所需的劳动力，既作了全面、合理的安排，又本着“花力少、增产大”的原则，千方百计地挖掘劳动潜力，采取集腋成裘的办法，积极提供农业生产对劳动力的需要。这样，对实现农业生产的持续跃进起了重大保证作用。
    我国的农业生产，在建国以来特别是大跃进以来，有了巨大的发展，发展速度是史无前例的，是一切资本主义国家望尘莫及的。但是我们也必须看到，现时我国农业主要还是手工业生产，技术还比较落后，劳动生产率还不高，解决这个问题的根本途径，是在进一步巩固和发展人民公社的同时，加速农业的技术改造，逐步实现农业机械化、水利化、电气化，大大提高农业劳动生产率，大大提高农、副产品的产量，从而使农业这个国民经济的基础，得到不断的发展和壮大。为了加速农业的技术改造，实现农业机械化、水利化、电气化的宏伟目标，我省人民要尽最大努力，争取在今后若干年内，有计划、有步骤地在农业生产上全面发展机器操作，做到耕作、播种、排灌、收割、加工、运输等主要环节的机械化；做到彻底实现河网化，水利化；做到公社工业全部用电，排灌动力大部用电；同时，还应当根据合理施肥的要求，大大增加化肥的使用量，只有这样，才能根本改变我省农业的技术落后状况，实现农业现代化。
    尽快地发展农业生产，进一步地贯彻以农业为基础的方针，必须继续加强党的领导，大搞群众运动。目前全省人民公社有了进一步的巩固和发展，公社的经济力量更加雄厚，全省工业和其他经济部门有了高速度的发展，特别是我们贯彻执行了党的八届八中全会决议，全省人民的政治觉悟有了很大提高，这一切，都为我省实现农业生产的持续跃进，提供了极为有利的条件。我们必须继续高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的旗帜，充分运用这些有利条件，实现农业的更大跃进，促进工业和整个国民经济持续地高速度地发展。
