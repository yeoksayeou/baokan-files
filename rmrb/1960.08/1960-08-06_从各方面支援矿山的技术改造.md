    Supporting Mining Technological Transformation in All Aspects

    Prioritizing the development of the mining industry is a fundamental measure to concentrate efforts and ensure the sustained high production of steel. This principle is universally acknowledged. The current question is: what are the key priorities for developing the mining industry now? Based on the current state of mining production in our country, in addition to continuing to build a new batch of small-scale mines serving steel and non-ferrous metal production in a planned and step-by-step manner, the most important task is to vigorously carry out technological transformation of existing mines, especially small and medium-sized mines.

    Since the beginning of this year, the vigorously developing technological innovation and technological revolution movement has brought considerable changes to the production technology conditions of China's mines. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization is gradually increasing, and heavy manual labor is gradually decreasing. Many "small indigenous groups" mines have been and are transitioning to "small modern groups." However, due to the weak original technological foundation of the mines, the short construction time of many mines, and the fact that they are still in their initial stages, the existing equipment is not yet fully complete. In addition, most mines are located in relatively remote areas, and there are certain difficulties in cooperation with various parties. Therefore, the production technology level of mines, especially the large number of small and medium-sized mines, cannot fully meet the needs of steel and other industrial production. Obviously, under these circumstances, in order to ensure that steel production increases and obtains sufficient raw materials, it is necessary to use greater strength and faster speed to carry out the technological transformation of mines, so that the production of a large number of small and medium-sized mines born in the Great Leap Forward can be greatly increased in the short term to meet the needs of all parties.

    Whether mines can implement technological transformation at a faster speed, and whether production can be rapidly increased by a large margin, is of course determined by the efforts of the mines themselves. Each mine should use the spirit of self-reliance and hard work to carry out technological transformation in a more, faster, better, and more economical manner. At the same time, it is also necessary to organize all relevant departments to provide strong support to the mines from all aspects. This is also a necessary measure to accelerate the technological transformation of mines and rapidly improve the production level of mines. Self-reliance coupled with support from all parties will surely lead to faster progress.

    Thanks to the timely and correct guidance of the Party Central Committee, the mining industry has been elevated to the primary position in industry. All departments attach importance to mining work. The reports on supporting mines in Nanjing, Hunan and other places published in this newspaper today show that a mass movement to support the technological transformation of mines has already emerged. The experiences of these places are completely correct. It should be emphasized here that rushing to manufacture various equipment urgently needed by the mines is a very important task in supporting the technological transformation of the mines. The relevant machinery manufacturing enterprises must place this task in a position of priority. However, after the equipment is manufactured, it must be assembled, and after it is assembled, it must be transported to the mines, installed, and put into production. Therefore, this requires the transportation department, the construction and installation department, and the power department to work together to do these tasks quickly and well. Since the technical strength of small and medium-sized mines is generally quite weak, the relevant factories and enterprises should also help the mines equip and train the necessary technical forces. After a large number of people go to the mountains, a series of living problems such as eating, housing, using, medical care, and cultural entertainment urgently need to be solved. This requires various departments such as finance, trade, culture, education, and health to do their best to provide strong support.

    Organizing various industries to go to the mountains and go down the wells to provide on-site support, with factory-mine partnerships as the main form, is a good way to promote the technological transformation of mines. According to the experience of Nanjing, there are three major benefits to implementing this method: First, through partnership cooperation, relevant departments go to the mountains and go down the wells to understand the needs of the mines more specifically, and the support work is more practical, more targeted, and more timely. For example, in the past, if parts were broken in many mines, if they could not repair them themselves, they would have to travel dozens of miles to find a processing plant for repair. After arriving at the factory, they sometimes couldn't get a number, which had a great impact on mine production. After the factory-mine partnership, the machinery factory has special personnel to contact the mine, and if there is a problem with equipment and technology, they will immediately help solve it. If one company cannot solve it, several companies will work together, which effectively guarantees the needs of the continuous leap forward in mine production. Second, through regular cooperation activities, comprehensive and systematic support is provided to the mines, combining treatment of symptoms with treatment of root causes. After Nanjing's factories and departments established partnership relationships with five coal mines, they not only helped them solve the urgent problems at hand, but also sent leading cadres to work with mine cadres to formulate comprehensive technological transformation plans, help the mines train technical teams, strengthen the machine repair force, improve enterprise management, improve necessary systems, and implement the "four go to the mountains" of cadres, technology, equipment, and experience, laying a better foundation for the future continuous development of the mines. Third, it further strengthens the relationship between mines and various industries, which is conducive to mutual help and mutual promotion. For the workers and masses of various industries, through partnership cooperation, going to the mountains and going down the wells, they can improve their understanding of the importance of technological transformation of mines, and also have a deeper understanding of the arduousness of mine production, so that they can more consciously, proactively, and actively support mines and conserve raw materials. For mine workers, through the support of various industries, they will also receive a profound education in the communist style of cooperation, further understand the important role of mine production in the entire national economy, and thus carry out technological transformation faster and better, and increase the production of more coal and various ores to meet the needs of steel production and other industries. In short, the method of factory-mine partnerships, with all parties going to the mountains and going down the wells to provide on-site support, can enable more people to understand mines and support mines, and turn the work of mine production and supporting mines from a matter for a few people to a matter for the majority, thus forming a broad mass movement to support the technological transformation of mines inside and outside the mines, above and below the wells, and on and off the mountains. Compared with the method of simply relying on administrative departments to assign tasks in the past, this is undoubtedly a good way to promote the technological transformation of mines in a more, faster, better, and more economical manner.

    In order to support the mines in a planned and organized manner, it is also necessary to strengthen the unified leadership of the work of supporting the mines in all aspects. Nanjing has provided a good experience in this regard. They have established a professional leadership line from the city to the mine. The city has a leading group specifically in charge of supporting the mines, and each supporting unit also organizes working groups with the mines to reside in the mines to solve problems in cooperation on the spot. Leading cadres of the municipal party committee also often lead the heads of various departments to go to the mountains and go down the wells to inspect work, discover problems, and immediately designate relevant departments to solve them within a time limit. The result of strengthening unified leadership in this way can concentrate the strength of all parties, distinguish the priorities and urgencies, use the strength on the blade, make the support work more specific, practical and effective, and make the movement of supporting mines in all aspects both vigorous and down-to-earth.

    In order to enable the mass movement to support the mines to develop more deeply and persistently, in addition to strengthening organizational leadership, it is also necessary to do a good job in ideological work. First of all, we must educate cadres in all aspects to establish a global perspective, think about the overall situation in everything, proceed from the overall interests, and consciously, proactively, and comprehensively support the mines. Since developing the mining industry is the primary link in the current development of industry, we should grasp arming the mining industry and supporting the technological transformation of mines as a top priority. We must look further ahead and understand that arming the mines is arming ourselves. If the mines develop, the mining industry develops, and the production of important raw materials such as steel greatly increases, the production of various industries will be more proactive. If the development of the mining industry cannot keep up, and the most basic raw materials such as coal and ore cannot meet the needs, and steel production cannot increase significantly, even if other industries are armed well, they will still not be able to fully play their role. Isn't this principle obvious? Of course, while advocating that all industries consciously support the technological transformation of mines, mine workers should further promote the spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and clever work, and more actively and diligently carry out the technological transformation and basic construction of mines, and constantly improve the technical level and management level of enterprises. We must never have a mindset of dependence and waiting, a mindset of seeking large and foreign things, and a style of extravagance simply because we have the support of various industries. Otherwise, even if a large number of equipment and technical forces are transferred, it will still not be possible to speed up the pace of technological transformation, and even if some projects are transformed, they cannot be well consolidated. Therefore, mine leaders must understand that the more vigorously all parties support the mines, the more they must go deep into the front line of production, rely on the masses, and practically solve the specific problems in mine production and construction, and resolutely implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, unite together internally and externally, strive for excellence, work hard, and carry out the technological transformation and construction of mines in a more, faster, better, and more economical manner, so that the roots of China's industry are deeper and ensure that we have a solid material foundation to complete and overfulfill this year's industrial production plan centered on 18.4 million tons of steel, and better realize the sustained leap forward in industrial production with steel as the key link!

    从各方面支援矿山的技术改造
    优先发展采掘工业，是集中力量保证钢铁持续高产的一条根本性措施。这个道理是人所共知的了。现在的问题是：发展采掘工业，当前要抓的主要关键是什么？根据我国当前矿山生产的实际，除了继续有计划有步骤新建一批为钢铁和有色金属生产服务的小型矿山外，最主要的，还是对现有矿山，特别是中小型矿山大力进行技术改造。
    今年以来，蓬勃开展的技术革新和技术革命运动，已经使我国矿山的生产技术条件，有了相当大的改变，机械化、半机械化的程度，正在逐步增加，笨重的体力劳动，正在逐步减少，许多“小土群”矿山已经和正在向“小洋群”过渡。但是由于矿山原有的技术基础薄弱，许多矿山建成的时间短，还处在草创时期，已有的设备还没有完全配套，加上多数矿山都在比较偏远地区，和各方面的协作有一定困难，因此，矿山特别是大量的中小型矿山的生产技术水平，还不能完全适应钢铁和其它工业生产的需要。很显然，在这种情况下，为了保证钢铁增产获得充足的原材料，就必须用更大的力量和更快的速度来进行矿山的技术改造，使大量的、在大跃进中诞生的中小型矿山的生产，在短期内能大幅度地增长上去，以满足各方面的需要。
    矿山能不能用更快的速度实行技术改造，能不能迅速地使生产大幅度增长上去，决定性的当然是矿山本身的努力。每个矿山都应当用自力更生、埋头苦干的精神，多快好省地进行技术改造。同时，还必须组织各有关部门从各个方面对矿山进行大力支援，这也是加速矿山技术改造，迅速提高矿山生产水平的一个必要的措施。自力更生再加上各方面的支援，步子就一定能迈得更快些。
    由于党中央的及时的、正确的指导，采掘工业已提到工业的首要地位。各个部门都重视矿山工作了，今天本报发表的南京、湖南等地支援矿山的报道，表明了一个支援矿山技术改造的群众运动已经起来了。这些地方的经验是完全正确的。这里应当着重提出，赶制各种矿山所急需的设备，是支援矿山技术改造的一项十分重要的任务，有关的机械制造企业，必须把这项任务排在优先完成的地位。但设备造出以后，还要进行配套，配好套以后还要运到矿山，安装起来和投入生产，因此这就需要交通运输部门、建筑安装部门、电力部门同心协力一齐动手，才能把这些工作做得又快又好。由于中小矿山的技术力量一般都相当薄弱，因此有关工厂企业还应当帮助矿山配备和训练必要的技术力量。大批人员上山以后，吃、住、用以及医疗卫生、文化娱乐等一系列的生活问题，都迫切需要解决，这就要求财贸、文教、卫生等各个部门，都要各尽所能，大力支援。
    以厂矿挂钩为主，组织各行各业上山下井就地支援，是促进矿山技术改造的一个好办法。根据南京市的经验，实行这种办法有三大好处：第一，通过挂钩协作，各有关部门上山下井，对于矿山的需要摸得更具体了，支援工作也就更加切实、更加对路、更加及时了。例如，不少矿山过去坏了零件，如果自己不能修理，就要跑几十里路找加工厂修理。到了工厂以后，有时还排不上号，因此，对矿山生产影响很大。厂矿挂钩以后，机械厂有专人和矿山联系，设备和技术方面一有问题立即帮助解决，一家解决不了，几家一齐动手，这有力地保证了矿山生产持续跃进的需要。第二，通过经常的协作活动，对矿山进行全面、系统的支援，使治标和治本结合起来了。南京各工厂和各部门在和五个煤矿建立了挂钩关系以后，不仅帮助他们解决了眼前急迫的问题，而且还派出领导干部和矿山干部一起制订全面的技术改造规划，帮助矿山培训技术队伍，加强机修力量，改进企业管理，健全必要的制度，实行干部、技术、设备、经验“四上山”，为矿山今后的不断发展打下了更好的基础。第三，进一步密切了矿山和各行各业的关系，有利于相互帮助，相互促进。对于各行各业的职工群众来说，通过挂钩协作，上山下井，可以提高他们对于矿山技术改造的重要性的认识，对于矿山生产的艰巨性也有了更深刻的了解，从而能够更加自觉、主动、积极地支援矿山和节约原材料。对于矿山职工来说，通过各行各业的支援，也会受到深刻的共产主义协作风格的教育，进一步认识矿山生产在整个国民经济中的重大作用，从而更快更好地进行技术改造，增产更多的煤炭和各种矿石，满足钢铁生产和其它工业的需要。总之，通过厂矿挂钩，各方面上山下井就地支援的方法，可以使更多的人了解矿山、支援矿山，把矿山生产和支援矿山的工作，由少数人的事变成多数人的事，从而在矿内矿外、井上井下、山上山下形成一个广泛的支援矿山技术改造的群众运动，这与过去仅仅依靠行政部门下达任务的办法比较起来，无疑是多快好省的促进矿山技术改造的好办法。
    为了有计划、有组织地支援矿山，还必须要加强各方面支援矿山工作的统一领导。南京市在这一方面提供了一个好经验，他们从市到矿建立了一条线的专业领导，市里有专管支援矿山的领导小组，各支援单位也和矿山共同组织工作组，驻在矿山就地解决协作中的问题，市委领导干部也经常带领各部门的负责人上山下井，检查工作，发现问题，立即指定有关部门限期解决。这样加强统一领导的结果，就可以集中各方面的力量，分别轻重缓急，把力量用到刀口上，使支援工作更加具体切实而有实效，使各方面支援矿山地运动既轰轰烈烈，又踏踏实实。
    要使支援矿山的群众运动能够更深入持久地发展下去，除了加强组织领导以外，还要做好思想工作，首先要教育各方面的干部树立全局观点，处处事事为大局着想，从整体利益出发，自觉地、主动地、全面地对矿山进行支援。既然发展采掘工业是当前发展工业的首要环节，我们就应当把武装采掘工业，支援矿山技术改造，作为一项头等重要的任务来抓。要把眼光放远点，要懂得武装矿山，就是武装自己。矿山发展了，采掘工业发展了，钢铁等重要原材料大大增产了，各行各业的生产也就更加主动了。如果采掘工业发展跟不上，煤、矿石等最基本的原材料不能满足需要，钢铁生产不能大幅度增长，其它各行业即使武装得再好，也还是不能充分发挥其作用，这个道理不是显而易见的吗？当然，在提倡各行各业自觉支援矿山技术改造的同时，矿山职工要更加发扬自力更生、苦干巧干的精神，要更加积极努力地搞好矿山的技术改造和基本建设工作，要不断提高企业的技术水平和管理水平，绝不能由于有了各行各业的支援而产生依赖等待思想、贪大求洋思想和大手大脚的作风。否则，就是调去了大批设备和技术力量，也同样不能使技术改造的速度加快，即使某些项目改造了，也不能很好地巩固下来。因此，要求矿山的领导干部必须懂得：各方面越是大力支援矿山，越要深入生产第一线，依靠群众，切切实实解决一个个矿山生产和建设中的具体问题，并且要坚决贯彻勤俭办企业的方针，上下、内外团结一致，精益求精，发奋图强，把矿山的技术改造和建设工作进行得又多又快又好又省，使我国工业的根子扎得更深，保证我们有充实的物质基础，完成和超额完成今年以一千八百四十万吨钢为中心的工业生产计划，更好地实现以钢为纲的工业生产持续跃进！
