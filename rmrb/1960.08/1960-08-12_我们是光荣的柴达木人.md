    We Are Proud Qaidam People
    Liu Junming
    The predecessor of our Qinghai Qaidam Peking Opera Troupe was a troupe from Shanghai. In November 1958, we came to Qinghai to support the construction of the Qaidam Basin. Before departing from Shanghai, the treasure bowl of Qaidam had already attracted us. Therefore, when all the actors and staff bid farewell to the brother troupes in Shanghai, they said: It is the Party's greatest trust in us that we can participate in the construction of Qinghai. We will never let down the Party's many years of education. We will resolutely take root in Qinghai and become the first generation of Qaidam people. Full of the expectations of the Shanghai Party and government leaders and the people, we arrived in Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, and received meticulous care from the Qinghai Party and government leaders, which greatly encouraged all the actors and staff. After a few days of rest, we transferred to cars and arrived in Da Qaidam City (at that time, Da Qaidam was mostly tents and mobile houses) on November 29. I don't know who said, "Comrades, we have arrived at our destination!" Some comrades said "Ah!" and even lost faith in their own eyes; they seemed not to hear or see the enthusiastic applause and warm welcome from the people below the car. In theatrical language, they were "out of their minds."
    Some comrades, after staying here for a few days, became ideologically shaken and repeatedly asked for leave, trying to leave this place that needed us most—Qaidam. We listened to a series of reports from the leaders, which described many moving deeds, living heroes, and the future face of Qaidam, and pointed out that our work in Qaidam was like sending charcoal in the snow and umbrellas in the rain; the comrades with ideological fluctuations also settled down. Under the patient guidance of the local Party committee from theory to practice, and inspired by the long-term workers who persisted in Qaidam's construction, we gradually gained a new understanding. For example, every time we arrived at a mining area or army unit, we were greeted by workers and soldiers lining the streets. We saw with our own eyes the young oil-extracting girls, covered in the scent of oil, working happily day and night by the drilling rigs, braving the wind and snow; the workers in the aluminum mines, carrying ore from the top of the mountain to the bottom, in a continuous stream; the soldiers, unafraid of the severe cold and dealing with glaciers and snow, some comrades had their hands and feet frostbitten, but they were still full of fighting spirit and optimism. They didn't feel bitter at all. They always vacated the best houses for us to live in and saved the best things for us to eat. After our performances, the workers and soldiers always said: You bring the Party's care to perform for us, and we will respond to the Party and all the comrades of the troupe with practical actions—increasing production and overfulfilling tasks. Some units increased productivity tenfold or twentyfold that day. These facts greatly encouraged and educated us, making us deeply feel that only by performing for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers can we receive the greatest welcome and trust. We gradually felt that our performances were truly linked to the revolutionary cause and socialist construction, and there was nothing happier than this. Although we were still performing as we did in the cities, it had a new meaning. At this time, a sense of honor and responsibility arose. The worker comrades regarded us as relatives and as the Party's concern, and they cared for us so much. What reason did we have not to do our work well? At this time, we truly realized how much the basin needed us, how the workers couldn't do without us, so why should we leave them? Inspired by the revolutionary drive of the worker comrades, everyone expressed: The Party needs us, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers need us. If we are told to go into the sea, we will go into the sea, and we will never dislike the sea being deep; if we are told to jump into the fire, we will jump into the fire, and we will never be afraid of being burned.
    From November 1958 to now, we have been in Qaidam for almost two years. Under the leadership of the local Party committee, we have traveled all over Qaidam in the past two years and seen many rare treasures; even a piece of mountain rock or a handful of soil is very precious. The treasure bowl of Qaidam is truly well-deserved. Some people didn't recognize the true face of Qaidam at first, but after truly recognizing its true face, no matter who it is, they will fall in love with this place. Not only is that place lovely, but the people there are also our eternal role models. There is the Liu Hulan Oil Extraction Team, and the Xiang Xiuli Exploration Team. These people with lofty ideals are turning barren mountains into treasure mountains and barren land into granaries with soaring revolutionary vigor. With the communist education we have received in Qaidam in the past two years, we have undergone fundamental changes and improvements in both political thought and professional level; the actors who wanted to leave Qaidam in the past have changed from settling down to working with peace of mind, and then from working with peace of mind to settling down with peace of mind, and have proudly called themselves Qaidam people; I want to become popular in Qinghai, specialize in Qinghai, and blossom and bear fruit in Qinghai, to make outstanding achievements for the construction of the motherland's Qaidam.

    我们是光荣的柴达木人
    刘君明
    我们青海柴达木京剧团的前身，是上海的一个剧团。1958年11月支援柴达木盆地建设，到了青海。从上海出发前，聚宝盆的柴达木早就吸引着我们，所以全体演员职员在向上海各兄弟剧团告别时说：我们能到青海参加建设，这是党的最大信任，我们决不辜负党的多年教育，坚决在青海安心扎根，做柴达木的第一代人。我们满载着上海党政领导和人民的期望，到达了青海省会西宁，受到了青海党政领导无微不至的关怀，对全体演员职员鼓舞很大。休息了几天以后，我们改乘汽车在11月29日到达了柴达木的大柴旦市（当时的大柴旦多数是帐篷和活动房子）。也不知道谁说了一句：“同志们，我们到了目的地了！”有些同志“啊”了一声，甚至对自己的眼睛都失去了信任；对车下的热烈掌声和亲切欢迎的人们，好像是没有听到和看到，用戏剧的语言说，“失了神了”。
    有的同志在这里呆了几天，思想动摇了，一次再次请假，设法离开这个最需要我们的地方——柴达木。我们听了首长一系列的报告，报告中叙述了许多动人的事迹、活生生的英雄人物和柴达木的未来面貌，并且指出我们在柴达木工作是雪里送炭、雨中送伞；思想波动的同志也安定下来了。在当地党委从理论到实际的耐心教导下，在长期坚持柴达木建设的职工感召下，我们逐渐有了新的认识。比如：我们每到一个矿区、部队，都受到了职工、战士同志们的夹道欢迎。我们亲眼看到身上沾满了石油香味的年轻采油姑娘不分昼夜愉快地冒着风雪在钻探机旁工作；铝矿上的工人，从千米的山上到山下，川流不息地背运矿石；战士们不畏严寒和冰山雪地打交道，有的同志冻坏了双手双脚，仍是斗志昂扬，情绪乐观。他们一点也没有感到苦，他们总是把最好的房屋腾给我们住，把最好的东西省下来给我们吃。我们演出后，职工、战士们总是说：您们带着党的关怀为我们演出，我们要以实际行动——提高生产、超额完成任务来回答党和剧团的全体同志。有的单位当天就提高生产率十倍、二十倍。这些事实大大地鼓舞着我们，教育着我们，使我们深深地感到，只有为广大的工农兵群众演出，才能受到最大的欢迎和信任。我们逐渐地觉得自己的演出真正和革命事业、社会主义建设联系起来了，再没有比这更幸福的了。我们虽然还和在城市里演出一样地演戏，但有了新的意义，这时就产生了光荣感、责任感。工人同志们把我们当成亲人，当成党的关怀来看待，对我们这样爱护，我们还有什么理由不好好干工作呢？这时，我们才真正体会到盆地是多么需要我们，工人离不开我们，我们为什么要离开他们呢。在工人同志的革命干劲感召下：大家纷纷表示：党需要我们，广大的工农兵群众需要我们，叫我们下海我们就下海，绝不嫌海深；叫我们跳火我们就跳火，绝不怕火烫。
    从1958年11月到现在，我们在柴达木快两年了。我们在当地党委领导下，两年来走遍了柴达木所有的地方，看到了许许多多的奇珍异宝；即便是一块山石、一撮泥土，也是非常宝贵的。聚宝盆的柴达木真是名不虚传。有些人开始不认识柴达木的真面目，但是当着真正认识了它的真面目以后，不管是谁也会爱上这个地方。不但那个地方可爱，那里的人也是我们永远学习的榜样。那里有刘胡兰采油队，有向秀丽勘探员，这些抱有远大理想的人们正以冲天的革命干劲，把荒山变成了宝山，把荒地变成了米粮川。随着两年来在柴达木所受的共产主义教育，我们不论在政治思想或是业务水平上，都有了根本的改变和提高；过去想要离开柴达木的演员，从安心扎根改为安心工作，又从安心工作改为安心扎根，已经自豪地称为我是柴达木人；我要红在青海，专在青海，要在青海开花结果，为建设祖国的柴达木做出优越的成绩。
