Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot News: The Inner Mongolia pastoral areas have launched a production increase and economy campaign centered on increasing grain and feed production and developing livestock at high speed. This movement requires managing this year's planted grains and feeds; further developing the "100 mothers, 100 offspring" movement; and vigorously organizing land reclamation.

Beginning this spring, the Inner Mongolia pastoral areas launched a campaign to establish large-scale grain and feed bases. As of the end of July, the entire pastoral area had newly cultivated more than 2.2 million mu of farmland. Adding the original cultivated land, the total area sown with grain and feed has reached more than 3.5 million mu, an increase of nearly 1.7 times compared to last year. Each herdsman in the entire region now has an average of more than ten mu of farmland. Currently, the spring wheat harvest has been completed. According to the characteristics of the short frost-free period in the grassland area, Party organizations at all levels in the pastoral areas are now focusing on the late-stage field management of autumn crops, making all-out efforts to weed and water, promote the upgrading of seedlings, and strive for increased production in the autumn. Herdsmen in the Ikhe Zhao and Ulanqab leagues are also carrying out field red flag competitions to further improve the quality and speed up the pace of field production.

This year, Inner Mongolia's animal husbandry has achieved a substantial increase in production. Recently, taking the "100 mothers, 100 offspring" movement as the guiding principle, a new upsurge in grasping fattening and mating, storing fodder, and deworming and disease prevention has been launched to increase and protect livestock. Since the beginning of July, herdsmen in pastoral areas such as Xilin Gol, Hulunbuir, and Ulanqab leagues have been herding livestock in field grazing, and livestock have generally gained 80% of their weight. The number of large livestock mated with breeding females is equivalent to more than 82% of the total number of breeding females mated last year. The mating and improvement of winter lambs of fine-wool sheep has been done better than last year. In addition, more than 200 million jin of grass has been cut and stored as winter and spring feed. Animal husbandry and veterinary personnel have conducted quarantine, medicinal bath deworming, and vaccination for more than 14 million head/times of livestock. At present, the whole Party and the whole people in the pastoral area are not only vigorously grasping the management of autumn fields and increasing and protecting livestock, but also taking advantage of the lush grass and fertile land to mobilize labor and machinery to press green and reclaim wasteland. State-owned agricultural and pastoral farms and people's communes in various leagues and banners have comprehensively arranged the distribution of pasture farmland and the area of land reclamation. League and banner party secretaries and members are responsible for specific areas to ensure that autumn field management and land reclamation are carried out without delay. At present, in the main animal husbandry areas of the autonomous region, such as Xilin Gol, Hulunbuir, and Ulanqab, more than 1 million mu of wasteland has been reclaimed since July, equivalent to more than 70% of the cultivated land area in the entire pastoral area last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun News: The animal husbandry production front in Jilin Province is vigorously carrying out a movement to love, protect, and increase livestock, striving to achieve full pregnancy, full fattening, full mating, full accuracy, full birth, full survival, and full strength for livestock throughout the province. The central content of this movement is: seizing autumn fattening and grasping mating, grasping the collection of feed, and grasping the construction of livestock sheds.

This year, Jilin Province's animal husbandry production, led by pig raising, has made great leaps forward in both quantity and quality. According to statistics, by the end of July, the number of pigs in stock and the net increase in the number of sheep and poultry in the province had increased significantly compared to the end of last year. Large livestock have also increased slightly compared to last year. The proportion of improved livestock in the province has increased significantly. Among the surviving foals and calves, improved livestock increased by 36% compared to last year; among the surviving lambs, improved lambs increased by 8.5% compared to last year. In order to ensure the continued stable rise of animal husbandry production, all parts of the province are seizing the current season of lush pasture and estrus of livestock to vigorously collect feed, repair sheds and pens, and focus on fattening and mating. In terms of grasping feed and repairing sheds and pens, the three regions of Baicheng, Changchun, and Jilin alone collected 320,000 tons of various feeds. The amount of feed collected in the Baicheng area, where pasture is lush, was 40% more than in the same period last year. More than 70,000 pigsties and livestock sheds have been built in the three regions of Changchun, Jilin, and Siping.

Ensuring that all livestock are fully fattened is the fundamental key to enabling breeding females of the right age to achieve full mating, full accuracy, full birth, full survival, and full strength, and for livestock to safely overwinter and overspring. Recently, according to the instructions of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on the work during the off-season, further adjustments have been made to the labor force. While continuing to strengthen the late-stage field management of autumn harvest crops, the work of livestock breeding has been strengthened. Counties in Tonghua, Siping, Baicheng and other regions have successively transferred more than 10,000 cadres to farms, groups, and pens to cooperate with herders, inseminators, quarantine officers, and livestock farm directors to widely carry out the movement to love, increase, and protect livestock centered on "one seizing and three grasping." At present, all kinds of livestock have been generally inspected once, and the weak livestock of the third-class fatness are being individually grazed and managed. According to the inspection of Zhenlai, Tongyu, Qian'an, Changling, Da'an and other counties, since July, in just over 50 days, the livestock of the third-class fatness has decreased from 25% to less than 7%. Because the livestock have gained weight and recovered, the estrus of breeding females has also been faster. Therefore, various localities have adopted a method combining artificial insemination and natural mating to rush to mating. According to the survey of Dunhua, Da'an, Yushu and other counties, the pregnancy rate of breeding females has reached more than 70%, an increase of about 5% to 10% compared with the same period last year.

    内蒙古增产粮食饲料发展畜牧业
    吉林大力开展爱畜保畜增畜运动
    新华社呼和浩特讯　内蒙古牧区掀起了以增产粮食、饲料和高速度发展牲畜为中心的增产节约运动。在这个运动中，要求管好今年种植的粮食、饲料；进一步开展“百母百仔”运动和大力组织开荒。
    内蒙古牧区从今年春季开始，就开展了大办粮食、饲料基地的运动。截止7月底，全牧区新开辟农田二百二十多万亩，加上原有耕地，现在整个牧区粮食、饲料播种面积已达三百五十多万亩，比去年将近增加了一点七倍，全区每个牧民平均已有农田十亩多。现在，春小麦已收割完毕。牧区各级党组织，根据草原地带无霜期较短的特点，正狠抓秋季作物的后期田间管理。各地把相当一部分劳动力投入田间生产，突击锄草浇水，促使禾苗升级，力争秋季增产。伊克昭和乌兰察布盟牧民还开展田间红旗竞赛，进一步提高了田间生产的质量和加快了速度。
    今年内蒙古畜牧业获得大幅度增产。最近，各地又以“百母百仔”运动为纲，掀起了抓膘配种、贮备饲草、驱虫防疫等增畜保畜新高潮。锡林郭勒、呼伦贝尔、乌兰察布等牧区牧民，从7月初开始，赶着牲畜在野营放牧，牲畜已经普遍有八成上膘。全区大家畜受配母畜，已相当于去年全年受配母畜的82％以上。绵山羊冬羔配种改良，比去年作得更好。此外，还打了两亿多斤草作冬春的饲料。畜牧兽医人员已为一千四百多万头次牲畜进行了检疫、药浴驱虫和注射防疫。现在，牧区全党全民一面大抓秋田管理和增畜保畜，一面又乘草青地肥，调集劳动力和机械动力压青开荒。各盟、旗的国营农牧场、人民公社，对牧场农田的分布、开荒面积，都进行了全面安排。各盟、旗委书记和委员，分片包干，一抓到底，使秋田管理和垦荒做到两不误。目前仅自治区主要畜牧区锡林郭勒、呼伦贝尔和乌兰察布等地，7月以来已经开荒一百多万亩，相当于去年全牧区耕地面积的70％以上。
    新华社长春讯　吉林省畜牧业生产战线，大力开展爱畜、保畜、增畜运动，力争实现全省牲畜满怀、满膘和全配、全准、全生、全活、全壮。这个运动的中心内容是：抢秋膘和抓配种、抓采集饲料、抓畜舍建设。
    今年，吉林省以养猪为首的畜牧业生产，无论在数量或质量上都有很大的跃进。据统计，到7月末全省生猪存栏数，羊只、家禽净增数都比去年年底有很大增长。大家畜比去年也略有增加。全省牲畜的改良畜比重增加很大。已成活的马驹和牛犊中，改良畜比去年增加36％；已成活的羔羊中，改良羔比去年增加8.5％。为了使畜牧业生产继续稳定上升，全省各地正在抓紧当前牧草繁茂、家畜发情的季节，大力采集饲料、修棚搭圈和狠抓增膘、配种工作。在抓饲料和修棚圈方面，仅白城、长春、吉林等三个地区采集的各种饲料达三十二万吨。牧草繁茂的白城地区采集的饲料比去年同期多40％。长春、吉林、四平三个地区已修建了猪舍畜棚七万多间。
    保证全部牲畜满膘，是使适龄母畜实现全配、全准、全生、全活、全壮和牲畜安全过冬渡春的根本关键。最近各地根据中共吉林省委关于挂锄期间工作的指示，对劳力做了进一步的调整，一边继续加强秋收作物的后期田间管理，一边加强了牲畜饲养工作。通化、四平、白城等地区的各县先后抽调了一万多名干部下场、下群、下圈，和放牧员、配种员、防疫员、畜牧场长协作，广泛开展以“一抢三抓”为中心的爱畜、增畜、保畜运动。现在各地对各种牲畜已普遍进行一次检查，把三类膘的瘦弱畜，实行单独放牧和管理。据镇赉、通榆、乾安、长岭、大安等县的检查，从7月以来，仅五十多天的时间，三类膘的牲畜已由25％下降到不足7％。由于牲畜增膘复壮，母畜发情也快了，各地为此采取人工授精与自然交配相结合的方法突击配种。据敦化、大安、榆树等县的调查，母畜怀胎率都达70％以上，比去年同期提高5％至10％左右。
