Republic of the Congo
(formerly French Middle Congo)

The Republic of the Congo, formerly known as Middle Congo, is located in the southern part of Equatorial Africa on the west bank of the Congo River, opposite the former Belgian Congo. Its capital is Brazzaville. The Congo has an area of 342,000 square kilometers. The population is estimated at 765,000. The Congo was originally part of the ancient Kingdom of Kongo. In the fifteenth century, the Portuguese invaded. In 1880, the Frenchman Brazza arrived on the banks of the Congo River, and subsequently, France established colonial rule here.

The Congo is a backward agricultural country. Residents mainly rely on farming and logging for a living. Timber is the country's main economic resource. About half of the country is covered by tropical forests. In 1956, timber exports accounted for 50% of total exports. In addition, the main agricultural products here are cassava, peanuts, bananas, palm, etc. Mineral resources are abundant, including manganese, iron, lead, copper, silver, oil, and diamonds. The manganese deposits in the Franceville area are estimated to exceed 300 million tons. All of Congo's resources are controlled by French monopoly capitalist groups. The Compagnie Minière de l'Ogooué (COMILOG) and the Compagnie Française du Haut et Bas-Congo almost monopolize all the wealth of this country.

After World War II, American imperialism began to infiltrate this area. In the Compagnie Minière de l'Ogooué, which was established specifically to exploit manganese mines in the Franceville area, "United States Steel Corporation" seized 49% of the shares. Mobil Oil and the French Petroleum Company have also jointly conducted oil exploration along the coast.

The Congolese people have waged a long and heroic struggle against French rule. After World War II, the Congolese people's struggle for national independence further intensified. In 1951, the Congolese working class and the working classes of Chad, Central Africa, and Gabon formed the General Confederation of Equatorial Africa. After the establishment of the "French Community," the Congolese people continued to struggle. In June 1959, mass anti-French uprisings broke out in Mindouli, Kouka, and other places in southern Congo. The French authorities were finally forced to agree to Congo's independence within the "French Community." (Picture attached)

    刚果共和国
    （原法属中央刚果）
    刚果共和国原名中央刚果，位于赤道非洲南部刚果河西岸地区，与前比属刚果隔河相对。首府布拉柴维尔。刚果面积三十四万二千平方公里。人口估计为七十六万五千人。刚果原是古代刚果王国的一部分。十五世纪葡萄牙人入侵。1880年法国人布拉柴到达了刚果河畔，随后法国就在这里建立了殖民统治。
    刚果是一个落后的农业国。居民主要靠耕种和砍伐木材为生。木材是这个国家的主要经济资源。全境约有一半土地为热带森林所遮盖。1956年木材输出占出口总额的50％。此外，这里的主要农产品有木薯、花生、香蕉、棕榈等。矿藏丰富，有锰、铁、铅、铜、银、石油、金刚石等。弗朗斯维耳地区的锰矿蕴藏量估计超过三亿吨。刚果的全部资源都控制在法国垄断资本集团手中。贵罗—尼阿里贸易公司和法国上下刚果公司几乎垄断了这个国家的一切财富。
    第二次世界大战后，美帝国主义开始渗入这个地区。在专为开采弗朗斯维耳地区锰矿设立的欧果韦矿业公司内，“美国钢铁公司”就攫取了49％的股份。美孚—莫比耳石油公司和法国石油公司也合伙在沿海一带进行石油勘察。
    刚果人民为反对法国的统治曾进行了长期的英勇斗争。第二次世界大战后，刚果人民争取民族独立的斗争进一步高涨，1951年，刚果工人阶级与乍得、中非、加蓬三个国家的工人阶级组成了赤道非洲总工会。在“法兰西共同体”成立后，刚果人民继续进行斗争。1959年6月在刚果南部的明杜耳、库卡等地都爆发了群众性的反法起义。法国当局终于被迫同意刚果在“法兰西共同体”内独立。（附图片）
