The Shihuiyao Team Uses Troops Skillfully
    Yang Zhaoquan, Yu Nanrong, Sun Daikun
    Recently, we conducted some investigations and research on how to organize and use labor in the Shihuiyao Team of the Lianglukou Production Team of the Xunyang Commune in Zhenyuan County, Guizhou Province. From the investigation, we found that the Shihuiyao Team has done a lot of meticulous work in rationally arranging labor and has successfully completed various production tasks.
    After concentrating the labor force in the fields, how to manage and use these labor forces well so that they can play a greater role in production is an extremely important issue. During our investigation of the Shihuiyao Team, we found that the cadres of this team solved this problem very well. They are good at managing labor, good at flexible command, and flexible in using troops; they can arrange and use labor according to the different situations of labor strength, technical difficulty, and the urgency of the work, adapting to people, time, place, and work, so that steel is used on the cutting edge, and each labor force concentrated in the field can be used in the most appropriate place.
    Arranging Labor According to Four "Adaptations"
    Adapting to people means dividing work according to age, physical strength, and technical level. There are two advantages to arranging labor in this way: First, the labor force is basically fixed, which is conducive to giving play to everyone's initiative and enthusiasm; second, it is used properly, everyone has appropriate work to do, everything is done by the right person, and everyone gets what they deserve. The total agricultural labor force invested in the field in the whole team is 43 (18 main labor forces and 25 semi-labor forces). In addition, there are 11 vacationing students and elderly commune members who voluntarily request to do some light work, so there are generally 79 various labor forces engaged in agricultural work every day. Among these 79 people, in addition to the 18 strong laborers who can do all kinds of work, the remaining semi-labor forces and auxiliary labor forces each have their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, the eleven elderly commune members, although they have decades of experience in intensive farming, are "willing but unable," and can only do some auxiliary labor in the fields, or come forward as "staff officers." Dozens of laborers have their own characteristics, but the cadres of the Shihuiyao Team are very familiar with the characteristics of each person. Whenever a new task is assigned, they first rank these laborers and arrange them according to their characteristics and special circumstances, adapting to people. Taking the current field management as an example, although there are many work items, it is not chaotic at all. The team roughly divides various work into three categories: field work, soil work, and miscellaneous work (mainly transporting fertilizer, as well as transporting grain and grass, etc.). Strong young people are specially assigned to do heavy work such as transporting fertilizer, grain, and grass; young women and experienced old farmers weed rice seedlings and apply top dressing; commune members who cannot go to the fields and are old and weak, as well as women who are skilled and clever, are specially assigned to do soil work such as weeding and sowing, so that everyone can show their talents in their respective production positions.
    Adapting to time means arranging labor according to the season, climate, and time. The cadres and commune members of the Shihuiyao Team have concluded from years of production practice that grasping the season, grasping the climate, and grasping the time means grasping the labor force. They said, "As long as the effort is put on the 'fire mouth', a large number of labor forces can be saved." Otherwise, it will be "doing more work with less results." When the eleven acres of corn in Laopi Chong in this team grew to one foot high, the team leader Xiang Qingyun arranged for eleven people to weed, planning to finish weeding in eleven workdays. However, on that day, the production team transferred all the labor force to another team to dig potatoes. Later, it rained continuously for more than ten days, missing the opportunity. The weeds in the cornfield grew very vigorously, and it took thirty-three workdays to weed, which invisibly wasted twenty-two workdays. Therefore, the Shihuiyao Team pays special attention to grasping the season when arranging work. Generally, plans are made five to ten days before each work is carried out, with short-term arrangements of one to two days. This not only achieves timeliness, but also achieves orderliness, and the effort is put on the "cutting edge." This team also has two sets of work arrangements every day. Commune members go out to work with more than two sets of tools: they do sunny work on sunny days and rainy work on rainy days, flexibly directed by the team leader, so that the labor force arrangement closely adapts to the changes in the weather. Generally, the work in the morning is not delayed until the afternoon, and the work in the afternoon is not delayed until the next day.
    Adapting to the location means allocating labor according to the distance of the fields, the ease of cultivation, and the quality of the soil. The thirty-nine households of the Shihuiyao Team all live on the mountainside of the two mountains. The field work is closer, and the soil work is farther away. The farthest soil is more than ten miles away, and they have to climb slopes as soon as they go out to work. In order to avoid wasting time traveling back and forth for meals and to facilitate production, they built a canteen each in Shihuiyao and Liangtian, which are two miles apart, and divided the thirty-nine households into two "combat groups" with the canteen as the center. If there are no sudden production tasks, the two combat groups will arrange labor to work separately, and the work point quota will remain unchanged. This avoids the situation of wasting labor traveling back and forth for work. In this regard, the team has many methods and works very tightly. For example, the current task of accumulating fertilizer uses labor. The whole team adopted the method of people and cattle going up the mountain to step on manure. In areas with remote fields and high labor costs for transporting fertilizer, five cattle pens were established to accumulate fertilizer on the spot, step on manure on the spot, and apply fertilizer on the spot. Preliminary calculations show that the whole team will save more than 300 labor forces in transporting fertilizer alone.
    Adapting to the work means distinguishing between the urgency of the work, distinguishing between primary and secondary, both focusing on major agricultural work and taking care of general agricultural work. From the perspective of the Shihuiyao Team, although there are not many households and the fields are only a few hundred acres, "the sparrow is small, but it has all its vital organs," and all kinds of crops are planted, and the work items are equally complex. Therefore, in arranging labor, they always act according to the principle of taking grain as the key link and taking care of other things. For example, currently, they focus on grasping field management, taking care of the planting of late autumn crops and the repair of three-autumn tools, etc. The labor force used on the front line accounts for 84.3% of the total labor force. At the same time, the field professional team is the main body, and the temporary assault team is the auxiliary. For example, the current time for planting late autumn crops is particularly strong. In addition to assigning five commune members to specialize in applying top dressing to the three types of seedlings, the team transferred all the remaining labor force to rush to plant autumn sweet potatoes, carrots, and cabbage. After three days of assault, they went separately to weed rice seedlings and weed soil crops.
    People Don't Go Empty-Handed, Roads Are Not Traveled Empty
    In the two months from now to the autumn harvest, the labor force of the Shihuiyao Team has been repeatedly increased to 40, but it is estimated that only more than 1,900 workdays can be done before the autumn harvest, which is still more than 1,900 workdays short of the actual need. It seems that it will be difficult for this team to complete the production tasks on time and with quality. But this is not the case. The cadres and commune members are very optimistic and full of confidence in achieving a bumper harvest this year. The main reason here is that the cadres of this team are good at rationally arranging labor; one is that they are good at arranging work so that each labor force can play a greater role.
    This team has achieved that people don't go empty-handed, and roads are not traveled empty, which greatly improves work efficiency. Rational work arrangement is not a new problem in the Shihuiyao Team, but it is now more comprehensively developed. In the past, commune members had the good habit of "bringing fertilizer when going out and bringing firewood and grass when finishing work." Rational work arrangement is developed on this basis. For example, at present, according to the diverse agricultural work, the team has made multi-faceted plans for the existing labor force: bringing fertilizer to the fields when going out, and bringing firewood and grass back to the canteen when finishing work; combining grass cutting and fertilizer accumulation with cutting field ridges and roads; combining rice seedling weeding and soil crop weeding with fertilizer accumulation; commune members who look after cattle and field water carry sickles to cut grass and accumulate fertilizer; commune members who look after ducks take care of field water management and weed field ridge beans; commune members who transport grain to Zhenyuan bring firewood to the street to sell, and so on. Because the hands are not used empty and the roads are not traveled empty during work, a large number of labor forces have been saved. After the comprehensive use of labor, the team can save more than 1,500 workdays in fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer transportation, firewood cutting, firewood selling, threshing ground building, field water management, and field ridge bean weeding.
    Auxiliary Labor Force Plays a Significant Role
    In the Shihuiyao Team, whether they are young, middle-aged, old, or elementary school students, as long as they can do something, they will compete to find some work to do, and there is not a single idle person in the village. There are eleven elderly commune members and twenty-five students around the age of fourteen here. In order to take care of the health of the elderly and the younger students, the team tries to assign them to do some light and easy work that is within their ability. "Many hands make light work." These thirty-six auxiliary laborers who are not included in the team's labor force have done more than 360 workdays in July alone. Therefore, the team cadres also attach great importance to these auxiliary laborers.
    The twenty-five students of the Shihuiyao Team, although young and weak, are quite capable of cutting grass and looking after cattle because they live in rural areas. They are skilled and clever in cutting grass; they run fast in looking after cattle. Many of the thirteen- and fourteen-year-old students we saw can cut seventy to eighty kilograms of bedding grass every morning. After eating breakfast, some of the physically strong students also work with the commune members to do weeding work in the soil. The eleven old commune members, although a little older, are very good at doing work. For example, Yang Damao and Lei Damei, although old, are still very strong. Many middle-aged women are not as good as them in doing soil work. In order to achieve a large increase in grain production this year, they have all volunteered to participate in some soil work.
    Sound Production Responsibility System
    In all kinds of work, the Shihuiyao Team has a set of rules formulated through discussions by the commune members; a reasonable quota has been formulated for each agricultural work. In the past two years, the team has always adhered to the "four-fixed" small-section contracted production responsibility system of "fixing agricultural work, fixing quality, fixing time, and fixing work points." Because the production quota in the team is practical, adhering to quota management, quality inspection, and reward and punishment systems, production is carried out in an orderly manner, which greatly improves the commune members' sense of responsibility and enthusiasm. Going to work early and finishing work late has become a common practice, and thus labor efficiency has increased many times. The team does a relatively good job of "four-fixing" to the contracting team. Each team generally has five to ten people, and they flexibly divide the work on the field every day and carry out the contracting separately, implementing person-field correspondence. The commune members work with great enthusiasm, and every day they exceed the various agricultural work quotas by more than 30%, and some even exceed the quota by more than twice. For example, in the current grass cutting and bedding accumulation, it is stipulated that each person cuts eighty kilograms of grass every morning, and many commune members have exceeded the quota. At the same time, they also have a "three-grasp" system (grasping attendance in the morning, grasping inspection at noon, and grasping evaluation in the evening) every day, and promptly inspect the teams or individuals who fail to complete the production tasks for no reason; resolutely rework the work that is not up to the requirements; and promptly adjust the quotas that are found to be too high or too low. Putting the competition hand-to-hand into every agricultural work.
    The field production competition in the Shihuiyao Team has been going on enthusiastically. The cadres of this team regard organizing field production competitions as an important measure to mobilize the enthusiasm of the commune members. The characteristics of the field production competition in this team are mainly that field martial arts competitions are carried out for all kinds of work, and each commune member has an opponent. The team immediately commends the model groups or individuals who rank among the best after the martial arts competition. If they are rated as models for three consecutive times, the team also gives them bamboo hats or other things as rewards. This team has established models in rice seedling weeding, fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer transportation, and planting of late autumn crops. These models are also selected by the commune members face-to-face in the fields. Once the models are named, the commune members immediately set off a movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the models. The competition is carried out enthusiastically, and the production upsurge is getting higher and higher. For example, in the current fertilizer accumulation competition, commune member Li Yonghong cut 800 kilograms of bedding grass a day. After being named the fertilizer accumulation model of the whole team, all commune members were determined to surpass the model. In recent days, the fertilizer accumulation quota has been repeatedly broken. In the past, each person cut an average of 400 kilograms of grass per day, and now they have cut an average of about 700 kilograms, which is more than 70% higher than the original grass cutting efficiency. It can be seen that it is very good to carry out face-to-face competitions in all kinds of work, which is convenient for mutual learning, and also convenient for evaluating high and low, and the role of promoting production is very great.
    Good at Using Labor and Good at Caring for Labor
    "To make the commune members work well, first of all, the life must be arranged well." This problem is particularly prominent in the Shihuiyao Team. We saw that the commune members in the two villages, whether young or old, are all radiant and smiling, and they are all trying to improve production. We interviewed in the village, and the commune members reflected that the cadres of the team care about people, are considerate of people, and arrange our lives properly. There is nothing to worry about, and all we think about is production. In caring for the lives of the commune members, this team is particularly prominent in three aspects: First, the canteen is run well. Both canteens have thick family assets, with many vegetables, three meals a day, two dishes and one soup per meal, many varieties, and good taste, and the commune members are very satisfied. Second, there is work and rest, and they resolutely act in accordance with the labor and rest time. When the weather is hot these days, they go to work early in the morning, and at noon they "order" everyone to sleep for two hours, and finish work and eat at seven o'clock in the evening. If there is anything to do, they will hold a meeting for a maximum of half an hour and then rest. Therefore, some young people use the evening to study culture and Chairman Mao's works. Because the commune members have enough rest time to recover from fatigue, they are full of energy during production and work like dragons and tigers. Third, care and take care of the elderly, weak, sick, and commune members with special physical conditions. Because the cadres of the Shihuiyao Team are good at being considerate and caring about people, the commune members work with extra energy, which is also an important guarantee for this team with less labor and more work to be able to successfully complete various production tasks.

    石灰窑小队用兵有术
    杨昭铨　余南荣　孙代坤
    最近，我们在贵州省镇远县?阳公社两路口生产队石灰窑小队，就如何组织使用劳力的问题，作了一些调查研究。从调查中，我们发现石灰窑小队在合理安排劳力方面做了许多细致的工作，出色地完成了各项生产任务。
    把劳力集中到田间之后，如何把这些劳力管好用好，使其在生产上发挥更大的作用，是一个极为重要的问题。我们在石灰窑小队调查时，发现这个小队的干部对这个问题解决得很好，他们善于管理劳力，善于灵活指挥，灵活用兵；他们能根据劳力强弱、技术难易和活路的轻重缓急等不同情况，因人、因时、因地、因活制宜地安排和使用劳力，做到了钢用到刀刃上，使集中在田间的每个劳力都能用到最恰当的地方去。
    按四个“制宜”安排劳力
    因人制宜，就是看年龄、体力、技术高低进行活路分工。他们这样安排劳力的好处有二：一是劳力基本固定，便于发挥每个人的主动性和积极性；二是用之得当，人人有恰当的活干，事事有合适的人做，各得其所。全队投入田间的农业劳力共有四十三个（主要劳力十八个、半劳力二十五个），另外还有放假学生和自愿请求做些轻巧活路的老年社员十一人，因此一般每天搞农业活路的各种劳力共有七十九人。这七十九人中，除十八个精壮劳力样样活路能干以外，其余的半劳力和辅助劳力，都各有所长，又各有不足。比如十一个老年社员，虽有几十年精耕细作的经验，但“心有余而力不足”，只能在田间做些辅助劳动，或是出面当当“参谋”。几十个劳力各有特点，但石灰窑小队的干部对每个人的特点都很熟悉，每当一项新任务一布置，他们首先就把这些劳力进行一次排队，根据各人的特点和特殊情况，因人制宜地安排。以当前的田间管理为例，虽是活路项目繁多，但一点也不乱套。队里把各种活路大体分为三类：田头、土头、杂活（以运肥为主，还有运粮、运草等）。劳力强的青壮年就专门分配干运肥、运粮和运草等重活；青年妇女和有生产经验的老农薅秧、追肥；不能下田和年老体弱的社员以及手巧心灵的妇女就专门分配干土头的薅淋和播种，使人人都在自己相应的生产岗位上大显神通。
    因时制宜，就是看季节、看气候、看时间安排劳力。石灰窑小队的干部和社员，在多年的生产实践中得出的结论是：抓季节，抓气候，抓时间，就是抓劳力。他们说，“只要工夫用在‘火口’上，就可节省出大批劳力”。反之，则“事倍功半”。这个小队在老皮冲有十一亩包谷长到一尺高时，小队长向青云就安排了十一个人去薅，计划十一个工可以薅完。但当天由于生产队里把劳力全部调到别的小队去挖洋芋，后来又连续下了十来天雨，错过了时机，包谷地的草长得很猛，结果花了三十三个工才薅完，无形中就浪费了二十二个工。因此，石灰窑小队在安排活路上特别注意抓季节，一般都是在每项活路进行前的五至十天即作好计划，并有一至二天的短安排。这样既做到了适时，又做到了有条不紊，用的工夫也恰到“刀口”上。这个小队每天还有两套活路的安排，社员出门干活也带两套以上的工具：晴天就干晴天活，雨天就做雨天的事，由小队长灵活指挥，使劳动力安排紧紧适应天气变化，一般做到上午的活路不拖到下午做，下午的活路不拖到第二天做。
    因地制宜，就是看田地远近、看耕作难易、看土质好坏来分配劳力。石灰窑小队的三十九户人家，都居住在两山的山腰，田头活路较近，土头活路较远，最远的土有十来华里，并且一出门干活就得爬坡。为了避免吃饭往返耽误时间和便利生产，他们在相距两华里的石灰窑和良田各建一个食堂吃饭，以食堂为中心把三十九户人家划为两个“战斗组”。如没有突击性的生产任务时，两个战斗组分别安排劳力干活，工分定额不变。这就避免了干活往返费工的情况。在这方面，小队的办法很多，打得很紧。比如当前积肥用工，全队采取了人牛上山踩粪的办法，在边远田土运肥活路花工大的地区，建立了五个牛圈就地积肥、就地踩粪、就地施放。初步计算，全队光这一项就要节省运肥劳力在三百个工以上。
    因活制宜，就是看活路的轻重缓急，分清主次，既突击主要农活，又照顾一般农活。从石灰窑小队看来，虽然人户不算多，田土也不过几百亩，但是“麻雀虽小，肝胆俱全”，各样作物都种得有一些，活路项目一样繁杂。因此，他们在安排劳力上始终是根据以粮为纲、照管其他的原则来办事的。比如当前，就以抓田间管理为主，照顾突击播种晚秋作物和修制三秋工具等，用在第一线的劳力就占总劳力84.3％。同时以田间专业组为主，以临时性的突击组为辅。比如当前栽种晚秋作物的时间性特别强，小队里除分派五个社员专门追施三类苗以外，其余的劳力则全部调去抢种秋苕、胡萝卜和大白菜，突击三天后，又分头进行薅秧和薅土中作物。
    人不空手　路不空行
    石灰窑小队从目前到秋收的两个月中，全队的劳力虽是一再设法增加到了四十个，但计算到秋收前，也只能做一千九百多个工，和实际需要的尚差一千九百多个工。看起来，这个小队要按质按时完成生产任务，是困难重重的。但事实并不如此。干部和社员都非常乐观，对实现今年农业大丰收信心十足。这里的主要原因，一是这个小队的干部善于合理安排劳力；一是他们善于安排活路，使每一个劳力能发挥更多的作用。
    这个队做到了人不空手，路不空行，大大提高了工效。合理排工在石灰窑小队已不是一个什么新的问题，只不过是现在发展得更全面罢了。过去，社员们就有“出门带肥料，收工带柴草”的良好习惯，合理排工就是在这个基础上发展起来的。比如目前，根据多样的农活，队里就对现有劳力作了多方面的规划：出门带肥料到田里，收工带柴草等回食堂；割草积肥结合割田坎和割路；薅秧和薅土头作物结合积肥；看牛和看田水的社员带镰刀割草积肥；看鸭子的社员照顾管田水和薅田坎豆；到镇远运粮的社员带柴上街去卖，等等。由于在干活的时间做到了手不空使，路不空行，从中节省出了大批劳力。综合使用劳力后，队里的积肥、运肥、砍柴、卖柴、捶晒坝、看田水、薅田坎豆等方面约计可节省出一千五百个工以上。
    辅助劳力作用不小
    在石灰窑小队，无论是青年、壮年、老年，或是小学生，只要能做得一点事的，都要争着找些活做，寨子里看不到一个闲人。这里有十一个老年社员和二十五个十四岁左右的学生。为照顾老年和年龄较小的学生的身体，队里尽量分配他们做些力所能及的轻便活路。“众人拾柴火焰高”，这三十六个没有列入小队劳力之内的辅助劳力，仅在7月份就做了三百六十多个劳动日。因此小队干部对这些辅助劳力也极为重视。
    石灰窑小队的二十五个学生，虽然年轻力小，但由于他们生活在农村，大活做不起，割草、看牛等活路还是挺在行的：割草，他们手巧心灵；看牛，他们跑得快。我们看到的许多十三、四岁的学生，每天早上都能割七、八十斤垫圈草。吃了早饭，有些体力强的还和社员们一块去做土头的锄草活路。十一个老社员，虽是年纪大一点，但干活路很在行，比如杨大毛和雷大妹，虽然年高，但身体仍很健壮，干土头活路有许多中年妇女还不如他们。为了实现今年粮食大增产，他们都自愿请求参加做些土头活路。
    健全的生产责任制度
    在各项活路中，石灰窑小队都有一套经过社员讨论制定的规矩；每一项农活又制定有合理的定额。这两年来，队里始终坚持了“定农活、定质量、定时间、定工分”的“四固定”小段包工生产责任制。由于小
  队里的生产定额切合实际，坚持定额管理、质量检查和奖惩制度，生产有条不紊，大大的提高了社员的责任心和积极性，出工早、收工晚已成为风气，因而劳动效率成倍提高。这个小队做得比较出色的，是“四固定”到包工小组。每组一般五至十人，每天临田干活又灵活分头包干进行，实行人田对号，社员干活的劲头格外大，每天都要超过各种农活定额达30％以上，有的还超过定额一倍多。比如当前的割草垫圈积肥，规定每人每早上割八十斤草，不少社员都超过了定额。同时，他们还有一日“三抓”（早上抓出工、中午抓检查、晚上抓评比）的制度，对无故完不成生产任务的小组或个人，就及时地进行检查；活路做得不合要求的坚决返工；发现有偏高偏低的定额，及时进行合理调整。把对手赛具体到每项农活
    石灰窑小队的田间生产竞赛一直搞得热火朝天。这个小队的干部把组织田间生产竞赛作为调动社员生产积极性的重要措施。这个小队的田间生产竞赛的特点，主要是样样活路进行田间比武，社员们个个有对手。经过比武而名列前茅的标兵小组或个人，小队立即表扬，连续三次都评为标兵的，小队还送给斗笠或其它东西作为奖励。这个小队在薅秧、积肥、运肥、种晚秋作物等方面都树有标兵，这些标兵又是社员面对面在田间评选出来的，一经命名标兵之后，社员们立即掀起学、赶、超标兵运动，竞赛搞得热火朝天，生产高潮越来越高。如在当前的积肥比武中，社员李永洪一天割八百斤垫草，被命名为全队的积肥标兵后，社员们人人决心超标兵，连日来积肥定额一再突破，以前每人每天平均割草四百斤，现已平均割到七百斤左右，比原来割草工效提高70％多。可见，样样活路开展面对面的竞赛很好，既便于互相学习，又便于评比高低，推动生产的作用很大。
     善于使用劳力善于爱护劳力
    “要社员干活好，首先要生活安排好”这个问题在石灰窑小队显得格外突出。我们看到两个寨子的社员，不论年轻的或年老的个个红光满面，喜笑颜开，都是一个劲争取把生产搞好。我们在寨子里访问，社员们反映说：队里的干部会关心人，体贴人，给我们把生活安排得妥妥贴贴的，没有什么牵心挂肠，想到的就是搞生产。在关心社员生活上，这个小队特别突出的有三个方面：一是食堂办得出色。两个食堂家底都很厚，蔬菜多，一日三餐，每餐两菜一汤，花样多，味道好，社员吃得非常满意。二是有劳有逸，坚决按照劳动作息时间办事。这段天气热，他们早上天麻麻亮就出工，中午都要“命令”大家睡两个钟头的觉，晚上七点收工吃饭，有事最多开半小时会就各自休息。因此，有的青年就利用晚上学习文化和毛主席的著作。由于社员有了充足的休息时间恢复疲劳，生产时精力充沛，干活如龙似虎。三是关心和照顾年老体弱、生病和身体有特殊情况的社员。由于石灰窑小队干部善于体贴人关心人，社员干活的劲头也就格外大，这也是这个小队劳力少、活路多，能够出色的完成各项生产任务的一条重要保证。
