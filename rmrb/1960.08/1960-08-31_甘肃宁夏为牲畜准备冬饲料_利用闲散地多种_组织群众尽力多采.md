Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou. Gansu Province is seizing the current opportune moment, fully mobilizing the masses to plant forage, establish feed bases, and collect wild forage. To date, various regions throughout the province have utilized barren mountains, gullies, and wastelands to plant over 1.4 million mu of feed and forage crops. The collection and storage of various feeds have reached over 50% of the planned target.

Various localities are fully utilizing barren gullies, slopes, mountains, wastelands, and all idle, scattered land to plant feed. In July, the Pingliang Special District utilized the slack time in agriculture to plant over 7,000 alfalfa ditches, over 900 alfalfa mountains, and a large number of alfalfa plains and dams, totaling 1.07 million mu. The Lanzhou suburban people's communes have adopted methods combining the establishment of feed bases with intercropping and mixed cropping in farmland, as well as combining concentrated planting with regular planting. As of now, the city has sown over 40,000 mu of feed crops and over 3,200 mu of forage, exceeding the original plan.

While planting feed and forage crops, various localities are also focusing on field management of autumn crops, seizing the opportunity to weed, thin seedlings, and transplant, and collecting and storing large amounts of field weeds and green stalks. Many local industries are using community-run factories to process various leaves, stems, skins, shells, and vines into fine feed, which is properly stored.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan. People's communes and agricultural and pastoral farms in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are taking various measures during the current season of abundant vegetation to prepare forage and feed for livestock for the coming winter and spring.

Since this spring, people's communes and agricultural and pastoral farms have expanded the planting of green feeds such as alfalfa, grass millet, and green oats on idle land such as wastelands, river beaches, and mountain slopes. By the end of July, the region had planted a total of 700,000 mu of various pasture grasses. While concentrating efforts on managing autumn fields, various localities have also mobilized commune members to "carry bundles of grass back after working in the fields," and have adopted various methods to extract idle labor or establish specialized teams and groups to rush harvest wild grasses and vegetables for drying or silage. The communes in the southern mountainous areas have generally organized special personnel to go up the mountains to cut grass, and have stored large amounts of green grass for livestock to get through the winter. The Enhe Commune in Zhongning County launched a crash campaign month to cut green grass, collect tree leaves, and gather melon and vegetable peels, as well as wheat and bean stalks, and vegetable roots. The Donghua Brigade, which made the fastest progress, has already stored enough green feed for the entire brigade's 147 pigs and 4,200 sheep for the winter. The state-owned Qianyu Farm dispatched more than 200 people to form nine professional wild grass collection teams, which have collected more than 300,000 jin of wild grasses such as gray strips, reeds, and alkali artemisia suitable for various livestock to eat. In addition, a movement to produce chlorella is underway throughout the region. State-owned agricultural and pastoral farms, experimental farms, commune breeding farms, pig farms, and commercial departments in various counties and cities are actively breeding chlorella. Livestock and poultry in Shizuishan City have all started eating chlorella. (Attached picture)

    甘肃宁夏为牲畜准备冬饲料
    利用闲散地多种　组织群众尽力多采
    据新华社兰州讯　甘肃省各地抓紧当前大好时机，充分发动群众，种植饲草、建立饲料基地与采集野生饲料。到目前为止，全省各地利用荒山、荒沟种植饲料和饲草一百四十多万亩；搜集和贮存的各种饲料已达到计划的50％以上。
    各地充分利用荒沟、荒坡、荒山、荒地及一切闲散零星土地种植饲料。平凉专区7月份利用农闲空隙时间，种植成七千多条苜蓿沟，九百多处苜蓿山和大量的苜蓿塬、苜蓿坝，总面积达一百零七万亩。兰州郊区各人民公社采取建立饲料基地和农田间种、混种相结合，突击种与经常种相结合等办法。截至目前，全市已播种饲料四万多亩，饲草三千二百多亩，超额完成了原定计划。
    在种植饲料、饲草的同时，各地还围绕秋田管理，抓紧锄草、间苗定植，把大量的田间野草、青秆搜贮起来。许多地方工业利用社办工业，把各种叶、茎、皮、壳、蔓加工成细料，妥善地贮存起来。
    新华社银川讯　宁夏回族自治区各地人民公社，农、牧场等，趁当前百草丛生的大好季节，采取各种措施，及早为牲畜储备今冬明春的饲草饲料。
    今年春季以来，各人民公社和农、牧场等，利用荒地、河滩、山坡等闲散土地，扩大种植了苜蓿、草谷子、青燕麦等青饲料。到7月底，全区共种各种牧草七十万亩。在集中力量搞好秋田管理中，各地又发动社员“下地回来背捆草”，并采取各种办法，抽出闲散劳力或成立专业队、组，突击收割野草、野菜，干晒或青贮。南部山区各公社普遍组织专人上山打草，已为牲畜储备了大量的过冬青草。中宁县恩和公社开展了一个大割青草、采扫树叶和收拾瓜菜果皮及麦秆、豆秆、菜根等的突击运动月。进度最快的东华大队，已贮够全队一百四十七口生猪和四千二百只羊的冬季所需青饲料。国营前遇农场抽调二百多人组成九个采集野草专业队，已采集灰条、芦草、碱蒿等适宜各种牲畜食用的野草三十多万斤。此外，全区各地正在掀起一个生产小球藻的运动，国营农牧场、试验场、公社的饲养场、养猪场和各县市商业部门，都在积极繁殖小球藻。石咀山市的家畜家禽都吃上了小球藻。（附图片）
