    Strengthen Late-Stage Sugarcane Field Management
    Taking advantage of the current abundant rainfall and rapid sugarcane growth, Guangxi is focusing on late-stage sugarcane field management while strengthening the field management of mid- and late-season rice. In Nanning Prefecture, sugarcane-growing areas are adopting a method combining specialized teams and mass mobilization, implementing a four-fixed system (leadership, labor, cattle, and tools) to strengthen sugarcane field management. Most of the chemical fertilizers allocated to sugarcane areas by the Autonomous Region's Department of Agriculture have been applied to sugarcane fields, averaging over 15 jin per mu.

    In the late-stage sugarcane management work, various areas have summarized and promoted past experiences in sugarcane ditch sealing and row sealing to store and conserve water, enhance drought resistance, and ensure increased sugarcane growth.

    Tibetan Medicinal Materials Shipped Out
    The rich medicinal material resources in the Tibet region have been gradually developed to serve the country's socialist construction and people's health. In the past seven months, famous medicinal materials such as musk, rhinoceros horn, and pearls, worth 100,000 yuan, have been transferred to Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. A large quantity of valuable medicinal materials, including fritillaria bulbs, cordyceps, deer antlers, bear bile, Chinese goldthread, tiger bones, and leopard bones, will also be shipped to various places in succession.

    Among the wild medicinal plants and medicinal animals in Tibet, there are more than 100 commonly used medicinal materials, all of which are of excellent quality. The quality of Chinese goldthread ranks first in the country.

    Shanghai Transports Fertilizer to Support Suburbs
    Shanghai's urban area has launched a crash program to collect and deliver fertilizer to support the rural suburbs. To quickly deliver urban fertilizer to the countryside at a critical time when a large amount of fertilizer is urgently needed, the Municipal Party Committee's Agricultural Committee and health, transportation, and other departments have formed a temporary urban fertilizer support rural areas office to coordinate the effort. The Municipal Fertilizer Company has uniformly scheduled its 3,700 manure trucks to transport fertilizer. The municipal transportation and shipping departments are also actively exploring the potential of transportation tools to fully support the crash transport of fertilizer.

    The residents of the urban area's Second Great Ward, factory workers, government cadres, and school teachers and students have all been mobilized and enthusiastically投入这个运动.

    Storing Livestock Feed for Winter
    Baicheng Prefecture in Jilin Province, a region with developed animal husbandry, is carrying out a grass-cutting and storage campaign to actively prepare winter feed for livestock. As of August 7th, the region had harvested more than 75.5 million jin of sheep grass.

    This year, the forage grass on the grasslands of Baicheng Prefecture is generally growing well. In order to store a large amount of forage grass to supply livestock over the winter, the Baicheng Prefectural Party Committee and the Baicheng Commissioner's Office had already required all counties in mid-July to ensure sufficient storage of livestock feed for the winter while doing a good job in late-stage field management. Based on the instructions of the Prefectural Party Committee, various localities formulated forage storage plans at all levels according to the animal husbandry development plan and implemented them at the grassroots level.

    Crashing to Accumulate Fertilizer for Late Rice
    The late rice in Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, is currently in its peak growing season and has begun to develop ears. In order to provide enough fertilizer for the rice ear development, various localities have arranged sufficient labor to crash accumulate and topdress fertilizer, striving for increased late rice production.

    During the crash fertilizer accumulation, all localities have assigned secretaries to take the lead, with cadres leading professional teams, and have broadly sought fertilizer sources according to local conditions. In the water network areas of Wujiang, Kunshan, and Wuxian, the focus is on extensively gathering aquatic plants. In the coastal areas of Taicang, Jiangyin, and Changshu, where there are many tidal flats and lush weeds, the focus is on cutting green grass, adopting the method of gathering, cutting, embanking, and applying fertilizer simultaneously.

    加强蔗田后期管理
    广西各地趁当前雨水较多、甘蔗生长快的大好时机，在加强中、晚稻田间管理的同时，大抓甘蔗后期田间管理。南宁专区各蔗区采取建立专业队和群众突击相结合的办法，实行领导、劳力、耕牛、工具四固定，加强蔗田管理。自治区农业厅分配给蔗区的化肥，大都已施到蔗田里，平均每亩十五斤以上。
    在甘蔗后期管理工作中，各地总结、推广了过去甘蔗封沟封行、储水保水增强抗旱能力，保证甘蔗生长的增产经验。
    西藏药材陆续外运
    西藏地区蕴藏丰富的药材资源已经逐步开发，为祖国的社会主义建设和人民的健康服务。七个多月来，已有价值十万元的麝香、犀角、珍珠等名药材调往北京、上海等地。还有大批贝母、虫草、鹿茸、熊胆、黄连、虎骨、豹骨等名贵药材，也将陆续运往各地。
    西藏的野生药用植物和药用动物中，一般较常用的药材有一百多种，质量都很好，黄连的质量在全国居第一位。
    上海运肥支援郊区
    上海市区展开积肥送肥、支援郊区农村的突击运动。为了在农村急需大量肥料的紧要时刻把市区肥料迅速送到农村去，市委农委和卫生、交通等部门组成了城市肥料支援农村临时办公室，统一指挥。市肥料公司把所属的三千七百辆粪车统一调度运肥。市交通航运等部门也都积极挖掘运输工具的潜力，全力支援突击运肥。
    市区二大的里弄居民、工厂职工、机关干部和学校师生等，都已动员起来，热情高涨地投入这个运动。
    贮备牲畜过冬饲料
    畜牧业发达的吉林省白城专区各地开展打草贮草运动，积极为牲畜准备过冬饲料。到八月七日止，全区已收割羊草七千五百多万斤。
    今年，白城专区草原上的饲草普遍生长良好。为了储备大量饲草供应牲畜过冬需要，早在七月中旬，中共白城地委和白城专员公署就要求各县在搞好后期田间管理的同时，要贮足牲畜过冬饲料。各地根据地委指示，按照畜牧业发展计划，层层作出贮备饲草计划，并落实到基层。
    为晚稻突击积肥
    江苏省苏州专区的晚稻，目前正处在生长盛期，已经开始孕穗。为了供足水稻孕穗所需的肥料，各地都安排足够的劳力，突击积肥、追肥，力争晚稻超产。
    在突击积肥中，各地都由书记挂帅，干部带头，领导专业队伍，因地制宜地广找肥源。吴江、昆山、吴县等水网地区，就以大捞水草为主；太仓、江阴、常熟等县的沿江地带，滩地多，野草旺，就以割青为主，并采取边捞边割边堰边施的办法。
