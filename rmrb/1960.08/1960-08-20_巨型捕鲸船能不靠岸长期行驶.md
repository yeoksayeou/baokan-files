    Giant Whaling Ship Can Sail Long-Term Without Shore Leave
    A new giant whaling base ship, the "Soviet Russia," is being built at a shipyard in Nikolaev City, Soviet Union.
    This ocean-going giant has a displacement of 44,000 tons, the same as the Soviet Union's current largest whaling ship, the "Soviet Ukraine." It can sail at sea for long periods without docking throughout the entire whaling season. The ship is 217.8 meters long and 27.8 meters wide. The machinery is composed of two diesel engines, each with 7,500 horsepower at a speed of 115 revolutions per minute. The sailing speed reaches more than sixteen knots. The ship is also equipped with four steam turbine generators each with a power of 750 kilowatts and two diesel generators each with a power of 600 kilowatts.
    This ship can process seventy-five whales per day and can also process ordinary fish during the non-whaling season. It will be used for whaling in the Antarctic Ocean.

    巨型捕鲸船能不靠岸长期行驶
    苏联尼古拉耶夫城的一家造船厂正在建造一艘新的巨型捕鲸基地船“苏维埃俄罗斯号”。
    这艘远洋巨轮排水量同苏联目前最大的“苏维埃乌克兰号”捕鲸船一样，也是四万四千吨。它可以在整个捕鲸季一直不靠港地长期在海上行驶。船身长二百一十七点八米，宽二十七点八米。机器装置由两台在每分钟转速一百一十五转时各为七千五百马力的柴油发动机组成。航行时速达十六海里以上。船上还装有四台功率各为七百五十瓩的汽轮发电机和两台功率各为六百瓩的柴油发电机。
    这艘船每昼夜可以加工七十五头鲸，在不是捕鲸季的期间还可以加工普通的鱼。它将用在南极海洋上捕鲸。
