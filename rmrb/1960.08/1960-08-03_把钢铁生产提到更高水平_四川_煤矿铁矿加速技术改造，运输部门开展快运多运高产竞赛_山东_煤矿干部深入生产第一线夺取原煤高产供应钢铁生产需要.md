Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 2nd - The industrial and transportation departments of Sichuan Province are concentrating their efforts on the production and construction of coal, iron, ore, and transport to ensure that steel production rapidly increases to a higher level.

    Currently, workers in coal mines, blast furnaces, and mines across the province are deeply engaged in production competitions, striving to ensure that a certain amount of ore and coke is stored beside all blast furnaces in the third quarter of this year. All mines have reinforced their tunneling teams, actively promoting advanced experiences in rapid tunneling, ensuring that all mines maintain more than a quarter of reserve working faces. All mines are also vigorously improving mine production and transportation, mobilizing the masses to engage in underground and surface transport linkage, automation, double-tracking, train-based systems, and ball bearing application. Fifty small coal kilns along the railway line with a daily output of more than 100 tons are being renovated in stages. The renovation project of the first batch of thirty small coal kilns started in July. After the technical renovation of this batch of small coal kilns is completed by the end of August, the total coal output will increase more than threefold, which will greatly help ensure the coal supply for key steel plants and cities. Various special districts (cities) have also drawn a large number of laborers from within the industry and towns to support coal, iron, ore, and transport production through vigorously engaging in technical revolution, improving labor organization, and reducing non-production personnel. The first batch of personnel has recently departed for various coal and iron ore bases. Various places are also rushing to produce a batch of equipment and tools to accelerate the technical renovation of coal and iron mines. Chengdu City has organized twenty machinery factories to rush-produce power and water-lifting equipment for mines.

    Basic construction, transportation, commerce, grain, health, culture, and other departments across the province are also carrying out joint cooperation to protect mines and transport according to the characteristics of their respective businesses. Basic construction departments are concentrating their efforts to attack steel, iron, coal, and transport projects in stages. Transportation departments have launched a high-yield competition to transport quickly and transport more.

    Industrial departments across the province are further improving their leadership style and methods. Now, the first secretaries of the Party committees of various cities, districts, and counties, while vigorously grasping agricultural production, also focus on the production of steel, iron, coal, and coke two or three times a week. Various places have also clearly stipulated that leading cadres on the industrial front should go deep into the front line of production, eat, live, work, and consult with the workers, making it systematic and regular. In order to promote the effective solution of key production problems in various places and further arrange the lives of employees, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee recently selected a group of cadres from provincial-level industrial, transportation, commercial, grain, finance, health, and other departments to form mine and construction site production and living inspection teams, which went to nine special districts including Jiangjin, Mianyang, and Wanxian to carry out work.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 2nd - Workers on the coal front in Shandong Province are determined to fight hard in August, raising raw coal production to a new level, achieving a higher output in the third quarter than in the second quarter, to supply more raw coal to meet the needs of steel production.

    In the first half of this year, Shandong Province overfulfilled its total coal output plan. Workers achieved great success in fighting against water for coal in July, despite continuous heavy rains. The total output for the entire month increased by 46% compared to the same period last year. In order to win greater victories in August, workers in various mines have been actively preparing since late July. The Hongshan Coal Mine of the Zibo Mining Bureau, led by the mine director, established a special production preparation assault team, which inspected the production equipment for August and strengthened tunneling to prepare a coal mining working face for production in early August. The Xinhai Mining Bureau extracted three hundred workers from auxiliary workers to strengthen coal mining and tunneling work. In late July, Zibo, Zaozhuang, and other mining areas successively convened party congresses, four-level cadre meetings, etc., to summarize the work in July and formulate measures to strive for high production in August.

    In order to win high raw coal production, cadres at all levels have gone deep into the front line of production, fighting alongside the workers. At present, half of the cadres of the Provincial Coal Bureau have gone to the mines in Xinwen, Fangzi, Guanqiao, and other places to help with work. Leading cadres of various mines have also gone deep into the grassroots to help solve specific problems. The leading cadres of Fangzi Coal Mine and Heishan No. 1 Inclined Shaft have moved to work underground. The cadres of Zaozhuang Mining Bureau have more generally promoted the "one, two, three" work method of one day of study, two days of meetings, and three days of going deep into the front line of production. The Party Secretary of Taozhuang Coal Mine used this method to work with underground cadres to solve key problems such as the poor cooperation of workers in the third shift of the third mining area of the West Well, and the output of this area increased by 6.13% in late July compared to mid-July. The production scheduling work of various mines has also been strengthened, and leaders such as secretaries, bureau directors, and mine directors generally take turns on duty day and night. The scheduling work of the Provincial Coal Bureau has also been changed from one schedule per day to two schedules per day, so that it can grasp the actual situation in time and solve problems in a timely manner.

    At the same time, the Provincial Coal Bureau has also taken measures to quickly improve the production level of newly built mines. (Attached picture)

    把钢铁生产提到更高水平
    四川　煤矿铁矿加速技术改造，运输部门开展快运多运高产竞赛
    山东　煤矿干部深入生产第一线夺取原煤高产供应钢铁生产需要
    据新华社成都2日电　四川省工业、交通运输部门，正集中力量进行煤、铁、矿、运的生产和建设，以保证钢产量迅速提高到更高水平。
    目前，全省煤矿、高炉和矿山的职工，正在深入地开展生产竞赛，力争今年第三季度内所有高炉边都储备一定数量的矿石和焦炭。各矿都充实了掘进队伍，积极推广快速掘进的先进经验，使所有矿井经常保持有四分之一以上的预备工作面。各矿还大力改进矿区生产运输，发动群众大搞井下和地面的运输联动化、自动化、双轨化、列车化和滚珠轴承化。分布在铁路沿线的五十个日产一百吨以上的小煤窑，正在分期分批地进行重点改造。其中第一批三十个小煤窑的改造工程，已在7月份动工。这批小煤窑的技术改造到8月底完成以后，煤炭总产量将比原来提高三倍多，这对保证重点钢厂和城市用煤将有很大作用。各专区（市）还通过大闹技术革命、改善劳动组织和压缩非生产人员等办法，从工业内部和城镇中抽调了一大批劳动力，支援煤铁矿运生产，第一批人员已在最近分赴各煤、铁矿基地。各地为加速煤、铁矿山的技术改造，还赶制一批设备和工具。成都市组织二十个机械厂正赶制矿山用的动力、提水设备。
    全省基本建设、交通运输、商业、粮食、卫生、文化等部门，也都根据自己业务特点，开展保矿保运联合协作。基本建设部门正在集中力量分期分批突击钢、铁、煤、运工程。交通运输部门开展了快运多运高产竞赛运动。
    全省工业部门正在进一步改进领导作风和领导方法。现在，各市、地、县委的第一书记在狠抓农业生产的同时，每周都抓两三次钢、铁、煤、焦的生产。各地还明确规定，工业战线领导干部深入生产第一线与工人群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，要做到制度化、经常化。为了推动各地切切实实地解决生产关键问题，进一步安排好职工的生活，中共四川省委最近还从省级工业、交通、商业、粮食、财政、卫生等部门，抽调了一批干部，组成矿山、工地生产、生活检查团，分赴江津、绵阳、万县等九个专区进行工作。
    据新华社济南2日电　山东省煤炭战线职工决心大战8月份，把原煤生产提到一个新的水平，达到三季超二季，以更多的原煤供应钢铁生产的需要。
    今年上半年，山东省煤炭总产量超额完成了计划；职工们在7月份连降暴雨的情况下与水争煤又取得巨大成就；全月总产量比去年同期增长了46％。为夺取8月份的更大胜利，各矿职工从7月下旬以来就积极进行了准备工作。淄博矿务局洪山煤矿由矿长挂帅，专门成立了生产准备突击小组，一面检修8月份的生产设备，一面加强掘进为8月上旬生产准备出了采煤工作面。新汉矿务局从辅助工中抽出三百名工人，加强采煤和掘进工作。淄博、枣庄等矿区在7月下旬先后召开了党代会、四级干部会等，总结7月份的工作，制订争取8月份高产的措施。
    为了夺取原煤高产，各级干部纷纷深入生产第一线，与工人一起并肩战斗。目前，省煤炭局已有二分之一的干部下到新汶、坊子、官桥等地的矿井帮助工作。各矿的领导干部也都深入基层帮助解决具体问题。坊子煤矿、黑山一斜井的领导干部已经搬到井下办公；枣庄矿务局的干部已比较普遍地推广了一天学习、两天开会、三天深入生产第一线的“一、二、三”工作法。陶庄煤矿的党委书记运用这种方法和井下干部一起解决了西井采煤三区三班工人协作不好等关键问题后，使这个区7月下旬的产量比中旬提高了6.13％。各矿的生产调度工作也加强了，普遍由书记、局长、矿长等领导人员日夜轮流值班。省煤炭局的调度工作也由一天一调度改为一天二次，这就可以及时掌握实际工作中的情况，并作到及时解决问题。
    与此同时，省煤炭局还采取措施迅速提高新建矿井的生产水平。（附图片）
