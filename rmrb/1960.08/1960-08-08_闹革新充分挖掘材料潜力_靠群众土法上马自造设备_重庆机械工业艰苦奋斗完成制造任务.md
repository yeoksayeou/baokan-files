Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 7th – The staff and workers of Chongqing's mechanical industry system, in July, produced on time and in quantity more than 400 units (sets) of equipment such as rolling mills, ball mills, winches, and generators, as well as more than 40,000 spare parts for various steel plants and mines.

In July, the various machinery factories had to produce a large number of equipment needed for steel production, while also completing the production tasks of agricultural machinery and other products. In the production process, the employees tried every possible means to overcome various difficulties. The Chongqing Switch Factory's July plan to produce high and low voltage distribution boards, current transformers, and other products needed for steelmaking increased by 12.6% compared to last month, but there was a shortage of some materials. The factory's general branch secretary and the factory director led the workers to find leftover and waste materials, while also carrying out product innovation, achieving one material to be used for several purposes under the condition of ensuring quality. A high and low voltage switchboard with a unique style that they designed is half to one-third smaller in volume than the original similar products, saving 25% to 40% of materials, and the product performance has also been greatly improved.

Among the equipment needed for steel production, many are large products, and some parts weigh several tons. Some factories lacked the equipment to process such large products, so they extensively mobilized the masses to use indigenous methods to build simple special equipment, solving this key problem. In July, the Chongqing Water Turbine Factory produced a batch of medium-sized guillotine shears and a large number of gate valves for Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and steel plants in various special districts. One part of the guillotine shears weighed four tons. The factory did not have large machines, so the workers set up wooden sheds in the open air, moved the machines onto the processing parts, and used the "ants gnawing at bones" method to process them. At the same time, they used indigenous methods to manufacture four special machine tools, forming a professional line for processing large parts, greatly speeding up the manufacturing progress. A batch of guillotine shears they are currently producing has begun to be installed in some steel plants in Chongqing and other places. After receiving the task of producing a batch of rolling mills, the Chongqing Machine Tool Factory used most of the large equipment in the factory for processing. At the same time, they used indigenous methods to manufacture special equipment such as end-face milling machines and combined boring machines to produce gear machine tools that the factory regularly produces. In July, the factory not only excellently completed the production task of rolling mills ahead of schedule, but also created the latest record for the production of gear machine tools, enabling the factory to comprehensively overfulfill the monthly plan.

    闹革新充分挖掘材料潜力  靠群众土法上马自造设备
    重庆机械工业艰苦奋斗完成制造任务
    新华社重庆7日电　重庆市机械工业系统的职工，7月份按时按量为各钢铁厂和矿山，生产了四百多部（台）轧钢机、球磨机、卷扬机、发电机等设备和四万多件备件。
    7月份各机械厂要生产大量的钢铁生产需要的设备，同时要完成农业机械以及其他产品的生产任务。职工们在生产中，千方百计地克服了各种困难。重庆开关厂7月份生产炼钢需要的高、低压配电板、电流互感器等产品的计划，比上个月增长了12.6％，但是有部分材料不足，工厂的总支书记和厂长，就带领工人找余料废料，同时大搞产品革命，在保证质量的条件下，实现一件材料顶几件用。他们设计出的一种特具风格的高低压开关板，体积比原来同类型产品缩小了二分之一到三分之一，材料节约了25％到40％，产品性能也大大提高。
    钢铁生产需要的设备中，很多都是大型产品，有的一个零件重达几吨。有些厂缺乏加工这种大型产品的设备，就广泛发动群众，用土办法大造简易的专用设备，解决了这个关键问题。重庆水轮机厂，7月份为重庆钢铁公司和各专区钢铁厂生产一批中型剪刀机和大量闸阀，剪刀机的一个部件就有四吨重。这个厂没有大机器，工人们就在露天搭起木棚子，把机器搬到加工件上，用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的方法来加工，同时又用土办法制造了四台专用机床，组成了一条加工大部件的专业线，大大加快了制造进度。现在他们生产的一批剪刀机，已在重庆等地的一些钢铁厂开始安装。重庆机床厂接到生产一批轧钢机的任务后，就用全厂绝大部分大型设备来加工，同时用土办法制造了端面铣、组合搪床等专用设备，来生产本厂经常生产的齿轮机床。7月份全厂不但出色地提前完成了轧钢机的生产任务，也创造了齿轮机床生产的最新纪录，使全厂全面超额完成了月计划。
