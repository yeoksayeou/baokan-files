Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 25th—Since the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fifteen years ago, especially since the restoration of peace in 1954, industrial production has been advancing rapidly. In 1959, the total industrial output value of the entire North increased more than sevenfold compared to 1955. Among them, heavy industrial production in 1959 was 495.2% of that in 1955. The plan for 1960 is to reach 617.7%. Light industrial production in 1959 reached 383.7% of that in 1955.

After completing the task of economic recovery in 1958, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam put forward a three-year plan to vigorously develop heavy industry. The amount of investment used for the construction of heavy industry from 1958 to 1960 accounted for 73% of the total industrial investment. The amount of industrial investment in 1959 increased nearly twentyfold compared to 1955.

During the rule of the French colonists, Vietnam had no machine manufacturing industry at all. Now it is able to manufacture a large number of new machine tools, turbines, and tugboats.

The chemical industry in northern Vietnam has been initially established from scratch and has been developing rapidly. Chemical fertilizer production in 1959 increased by 7.9 times compared to 1955. The Hai Phong Plastics Factory has now been built in the North.

In terms of daily industrial products, the situation in which Vietnam has always relied on imports is gone forever. After the installation of the latest equipment in the Nam Dinh United Textile Factory, the output of cotton cloth in this factory in 1959 increased by more than two times compared to the pre-war year of 1939. In addition, knitting factories, woolen yarn factories, stationery factories, and paper mills have also been built one after another.

In the past, northern Vietnam had almost no food industry, but it has also been developed after the restoration of peace. Due to the rapid development of light industry, daily industrial products in northern Vietnam can basically be self-sufficient in 1960.

During the eighty years of French colonial rule in Vietnam, almost all of Vietnam's daily industrial products and means of production relied on imports. During the fifteen years of long-term war from 1939 to 1954, the meager industry was severely damaged. By the end of 1954, the output value of modern industry in northern Vietnam accounted for only 1.5% of the total output value of industry and agriculture.

After the restoration of peace, the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, relying on the high labor enthusiasm of the entire people and the working class, vigorously carried out economic recovery work. The Republic government not only properly took over the original enterprises from the enemy and moved the factories in the liberated areas to the cities, but also, with the help of fraternal countries, began to expand and build a series of modern enterprises. By 1957, Vietnam's industrial production had recovered to pre-war levels. The three-year plan for transforming and developing the economy, which began in 1958, pushed Vietnam's industrial production to a new stage.

The rapid recovery and development of industry in northern Vietnam has brought about tremendous changes in the national economy. The total output value of industry and handicrafts increased by an average of 42.7% per year, of which industry increased at an average annual rate of 67.2%. Due to the rapid increase in the proportion of industry in the national economy, the proportion of industry and handicrafts in the total output value of industry and agriculture in 1959 increased from 16.9% in 1955 to 35.5%.

This year, northern Vietnam is about to victoriously complete the three-year plan, and from 1961 it will step into the grand first five-year plan period. According to the policy determined by the Vietnamese Labor Party, the first five-year plan will give priority to the development of heavy industry in order to equip and transform the national economy with modern technology. Now the Vietnamese people are looking forward to the bright prospects of the future with infinite excitement and are determined to work harder to realize the country's production plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Kharkov, 23rd—According to TASS: The Kharkov Turbine Manufacturing Plant in the Soviet Union recently completed the preliminary design work of the world's largest steam turbine—the "K-800-1240" twin-shaft steam turbine. The power generation capacity of this turbine is as high as 800,000 kilowatts, and it can generate 4.8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. In other words, its power generation is almost twice as much as the total annual power generation of all power stations in Tsarist Russia in 1913.

The Kharkov Turbine Manufacturing Plant is now carrying out the technical design of this unparalleled steam turbine. Experts from this factory believe that, based on the design of steam turbines with a power generation capacity of 800,000 kilowatts, steam turbines with a power generation capacity of up to 1.2 million kilowatts can be manufactured in the future.

The design and manufacture of such powerful steam turbines will enable the Soviet Union to further reduce the construction cost of thermal power plants and shorten the construction period of new power plants, so that they can be put into production more quickly.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 23rd—Bulgaria's cement production in the first half of this year has been more than 3.3 times the total cement production in the entire year of 1939 before liberation, reaching a total of 749,000 tons. By 1965, cement production will increase to 4 million tons.

In order to meet the needs of large-scale domestic construction, Bulgaria is building and will build a series of huge cement plants. The first phase of the new cement plant in Vratsa Oblast is about to be completed. This factory will be fully completed in 1961, and it can produce 800,000 tons of cement annually. Another cement plant is about to be expanded, and by 1962, the factory's cement production capacity will reach 1 million tons. A new giant cement plant will be built near the village of Kremikovtsi in Sofia Oblast. After its completion, it will supply the country with 1 million tons of cement annually.

Due to the rapid development of the cement industry, Bulgaria's per capita cement production in 1965 will reach about 600 kilograms, ranking among the leading countries in Europe in cement production.

    越南北部工业生产巨步迈进
    苏联设计世界最大汽轮机　保加利亚兴建一系列水泥厂
    据新华社河内25日电　越南民主共和国成立十五年来，特别是自1954年和平恢复以来，工业生产正以迅速的步伐向前迈进。1959年全北方工业产值比1955年增长了七倍多。其中重工业生产1959年等于1955年的495.2％。1960年计划达到617.7％。轻工业生产1959年达到了1955年的383.7％。
    从1958年完成经济恢复任务后，越南民主共和国提出了大力发展重工业的三年计划。用于建设重工业的投资额1958年到1960年占工业投资总额的73％。1959年工业投资额比1955年增长了近二十倍。
    在法国殖民者统治时期，越南根本没有机器制造业。现在已经能够大批制造多种新式机床和汽轮、拖轮。
    越南北部的化学工业已经从无到有地初步建立起来，并得到了迅速的发展。1959年的化学肥料生产比1955年增长七点九倍。目前北部已建成了海防塑料厂。
    在日用工业品方面，越南一向依赖进口的情况已经一去不复返了。南定联合纺织厂安装了最新设备后，这个厂1959年棉布的产量比战前1939年增长二倍多。此外针织厂、绒线厂、文具厂、造纸厂等也相继建成。
    过去越南北方几乎没有的食品工业，和平恢复后也得到了发展。由于轻工业的迅速发展，1960年越南北方的日用工业品基本上可以自给。
    法国殖民者统治越南的八十年间，越南日用工业品和生产资料几乎全部依靠进口。而从1939到1954年的十五年长期战争中，那些少得可怜的工业又遭到了严重的破坏，到1954年底，越南北部现代工业的产值仅占工农业总产值的1.5％。
    和平恢复后，越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府依靠全体人民和工人阶级的高度劳动热情，大力进行了经济恢复工作。共和国政府不仅从敌人手里妥善地接管了原有企业，把解放区的工厂迁移到城市，而且在兄弟国家的帮助下，着手扩建和新建了一系列的现代化企业。到1957年越南的工业生产就恢复到战前的水平。从1958年开始的改造和发展经济的三年计划，更把越南的工业生产推向新的阶段。
    越南北部的工业的迅速恢复和发展，使国民经济发生了巨大的变化。工业和手工业总产值平均每年增长42.7％，其中工业平均每年增长速度达67.2％。由于工业在国民经济中所占的比重迅速上升，1959年工业和手工业在工农业总产值中的比重，由1955年的16.9％，增长到35.5％。
    今年越南北部即将胜利地完成三年计划，从1961年开始便跨进宏伟的第一个五年计划时期。根据越南劳动党确定的方针，第一个五年计划将优先发展重工业，以使用现代化的技术来装备和改造国民经济。现在越南人民正怀着无限兴奋的心情展望着未来的灿烂远景，并决心以加倍的努力为实现国家的生产计划而奋斗。
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社哈尔科夫讯：苏联哈尔科夫透平制造厂最近完成了一台世界上最大的汽轮机——“K八○○一二四○”型双轴汽轮机的草图设计工作。这台汽轮机的发电能力高达八十万瓩，每年可以发电四十八亿度。也就是说，它的发电量比1913年沙皇俄国所有发电站全年的发电总量差不多还多一倍。
    哈尔科夫透平制造厂现在正在进行这台举世无双的汽轮机的技术设计。这个工厂的专家认为，根据发电能力为八十万瓩的汽轮机的设计方案，将来还可以制造发电能力高达一百二十万瓩的汽轮机。
    设计和制造这类强大的汽轮机，将使苏联进一步降低火力发电站的建设成本和缩短新发电站的建设期限，使它们更快地投入生产。
    新华社索非亚23日电　保加利亚今年上半年生产的水泥已经等于解放前1939年全年水泥产量的三点三倍以上，共达七十四万九千吨。而到1965年水泥的产量将增加到四百万吨。
    为了适应国内大规模建设的需要，保加利亚正在和将要兴建一系列巨大的水泥工厂。在弗拉查州新建的水泥工厂的第一期工程就要完工。这个工厂将在1961年全部建成，它每年可以生产水泥八十万吨。另一个水泥工厂将要进行扩建，到1962年时工厂的水泥生产能力就将达到一百万吨。索非亚州的克列米科夫齐村附近将要兴建一座新的巨型水泥工厂。它建成后每年将供给国家一百万吨水泥。
    由于水泥工业的迅速发展，保加利亚1965年按人口平均计算的水泥产量将达到六百公斤左右，将在生产水泥方面居于欧洲先列地位。
