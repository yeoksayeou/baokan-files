Xinhua News Agency report:

    The Xincheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Guangxi Province has conducted in-depth investigations and research among the masses, implemented policies for developing grain production in accordance with local conditions, and formulated a new cropping system of "emphasizing both staple and miscellaneous grains," and "multiple planting on one plot, multiple harvests in one season," opening up a path for high-speed grain production increases.
    Xincheng County began to promote this new cropping system last year, and achieved a bumper harvest in the same year. The total grain output increased by 26% compared with the previous year. In addition to self-sufficiency, it sold 34.27 million catties of grain to the state. In the first half of this year, the county harvested two seasons, and the total grain output increased significantly compared with the same period last year.
    Xincheng County has a large population and little land, the land is barren, and it is often affected by drought and flood disasters. Under these circumstances, how to produce more grain? The Xincheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that the key lies in leading production based on local characteristics and summarizing and promoting the good experiences of local people in agricultural production. To this end, the county party secretaries took the lead in going deep among the masses to seek advice and solutions. In May 1956, there was a long drought here, and many rice fields were cracked and unable to transplant rice seedlings. At that time, Yuan Bangdian, the first secretary of the county party committee, who was conducting investigations among the masses, saw twelve acres of rice fields growing lush and strong early corn in Nongrong Village, Nongrong Commune, the most remote mountainous area. This incident aroused Yuan Bangdian's great interest. He immediately sought out farmers with agricultural production experience to ask about the rationale for growing corn in paddy fields. The farmers said: There are many mountains and little farmland here, and there is little rain in January, February, March, and April. In medium-rice fields without water conservancy irrigation, plant a season of drought-resistant early-maturing corn first. When the corn is tasseling and flowering in May and June, it coincides with the rainy season. At this time, after harvesting the corn, it is just right to plant medium rice. If it continues not to rain in May and June, then plant another crop of autumn corn, which can ensure a good harvest and not miss the season. The experience of the old farmers enlightened Yuan Bangdian. He thought: If all the mountain fields in the county were changed in this way, it would not only adapt to the drought conditions, but also yield an extra season of grain. Inspired by this, the county party committee organized a large number of cadres to investigate and summarize the planting experience of the masses in the mountainous areas. After investigation and repeated research and analysis, the county party committee formulated a relatively complete cropping system suitable for local characteristics, including expanding planting, intercropping, interplanting, and multiple cropping, fully tapping the potential of the land. In order to implement this new approach, the county party committee also divided the county into four types of areas based on natural conditions: mountainous plains, rocky mountains, hilly areas, and water-retaining fields with water conservancy facilities, and formulated specific measures for intercropping, interplanting, and multiple cropping, changing the past practice of planting only one or two crops on one piece of land to multiple planting on one plot and multiple harvests in one season.
    The implementation of this new cropping system in the county for the past two years has proven to have many benefits. First, it fully taps the potential of the land, resulting in high yields and high incomes. The Youth Production Team of Longqin Brigade, Xinxu Commune, after harvesting autumn sweet potatoes in November last year, immediately cultivated the land and planted 52 mu of winter sweet potatoes. When cultivating and earthing up the sweet potatoes in mid-January this year, they intercropped corn and millet. By the beginning of July this year, corn, millet, and sweet potatoes had been harvested one after another, with an average yield of 777 catties per mu (four catties of sweet potatoes are converted into one catty of raw grain), an increase of 77% compared with land of the same soil quality planted with only one crop of corn. At the same time, 3,000 catties of sweet potato vines were harvested per mu as seedlings and feed. Second, it improves soil fertility. Land that has been planted with legumes for many years has relatively loose and fertile soil. Because these crops leave a large number of fallen leaves and residual roots in the ground, which decompose into fertilizer. At the same time, legume crops have rhizobia, which have a nitrogen-fixing effect. This is not only conducive to increasing the yield of intercropped crops in the current year, but also improves the yield of summer crops. The Fenghuang Production Team of Beidan Brigade, Guosui Commune, planted peanuts in 1958, and the early corn in 1959 yielded 70% to 100% more than the crops in the land planted with sweet potatoes and late corn. Third, it can regulate and save labor. Early corn intercropped with soybeans allows the soybeans to be planted earlier, so that the work of early corn and planting sweet potatoes, autumn corn, and soybeans is not squeezed together. When the sweet potatoes and autumn corn are finished planting, the soybeans will also be harvested. After the soybeans are harvested, the autumn corn and sweet potatoes will be harvested one after another. In this way, farm work is staggered. According to the survey, intercropping corn with soybeans or intercropping corn with sweet potatoes can save four to six workdays per mu compared with planting a single crop. Fourth, it reduces weeds and enhances drought resistance. When several crops are intercropped, they are tall and short, and densely closed, so that sunlight cannot directly shine on the ground, weeds are difficult to grow, and water evaporation is reduced, thus reducing weeding labor and enhancing drought resistance. According to county meteorological data, rainfall from January to June this year decreased by more than 500 millimeters compared with the same period last year, but due to the vigorous promotion of intercropping, in addition to some early rice being affected by drought, dryland crops generally had a bumper harvest.
    In order to enable this new system to play a greater role, the Xincheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently organized a mass-based mutual visit and exchange of new experiences throughout the county. At the same time, it also mobilized more than 60 experienced old farmers from various communes throughout the county who are experienced in implementing this new system to form a working team and go deep into various types of areas to impart experience in order to further consolidate and improve this new cropping system and strive for a greater harvest in the second half of this year.

    After several years of trial planting, Guide County, Qinghai Province, has gained preliminary experience in growing rice on the plateau. This year, more than 40 mu of rice sown in the Heyin Commune are generally growing well. This is because the members of the Heyin Commune are actively strengthening the field management of rice, weeding and applying foliar fertilizer at the same time.

### 总结群众种植经验　推行新的耕作制度  忻城县粮食产量迅速增长

    总结群众种植经验　推行新的耕作制度
    忻城县粮食产量迅速增长
    据新华社讯　中共广西忻城县委深入群众调查研究，因地制宜地贯彻执行发展粮食生产的方针，订出一套“主杂粮并举，、“一地多种、一季多收”的新耕作制度，开拓了高速度增产粮食的途径。
    忻城县去年开始推广这项新的耕作制度，当年粮食就获得了大丰收，总产量比前一年增产26％，除自给外，还卖给国家三千四百二十七万斤粮食。今年上半年全县又收获了两季，粮食总产量比去年同期增产很多。
    忻城县人多地少，土地贫瘠，又常受旱、涝灾害，在这种情况下，如何生产更多的粮食？中共忻城县委认为，关键在于必须根据当地的特点领导生产，总结、推广当地群众的关于农业生产的好经验。为此，县委书记们都带头深入群众求谋问计。1956年5月间，这里久旱不雨，许多稻田龟裂，无法插秧。当时，深入群众调查的县委第一书记袁邦殿，在最边远的山区弄容公社弄容屯看到有十二亩水稻田长着葱绿粗壮的早玉米。这件事引起袁邦殿极大的兴趣，他立即找当地有农业生产经验的农民，讨教水田种玉米的道理。农民们说：这里山多田少，1、2、3、4月份又少雨，在没有水利灌溉的中稻田里，先种一季耐旱的早熟玉米，到5、6月份玉米抽穗扬花的时候，又正赶上了雨季，这时收了玉米，正好种中稻，如果5、6月份继续不下雨，接着再种一次秋玉米，既能保丰收，又不误季节。老农们的经验启发了袁邦殿，他想：如果全县的山田都这样改一下，不仅适应干旱的条件，还能多收一季粮食。在这一事情的启发下，县委又组织大批干部到山区调查总结群众的种植经验。县委经过调查和反复的研究分析，订出一套较为完整的适合本地特点的扩种、间种、套种、复种的耕作制度。如实行高秆作物与矮秆作物间种，迟熟作物与早熟作物间种等，充分挖掘了土地潜力。为了贯彻这一新的作法，县委还根据自然条件把全县划为山区平地、石山地、丘陵地和有水利设施的保水田四类地区，分别制定了间种、套种、复种的具体措施，把过去一块地只种一种作物和两种作物，改为一地多种，一季多收。
    这一新的耕作制度两年来在全县推广的情况证明，好处很多。首先是充分挖掘了土地潜力，产量高，收入大。新圩公社龙琴大队的青年生产队，去年11月间收了秋红茹（即甘薯）以后，接着整地种了五十二亩冬种红茹，到今年1月中句中耕培土红茹时，间种玉米和粟子，到今年7月初，玉米、小米和红茹已先后收摘完毕，平均亩产七百七十七斤（红茹四斤折一斤原粮），比同样土质只种玉米一种作物的地每亩增产77％。同时每亩还收了三千斤红茹藤作为种苗和饲料。其次，提高了土壤肥力。凡连年种豆类的土地，土壤都比较疏松肥沃。因为这些作物在地里留下大量的落叶和残根，腐烂后即成为肥料。同时豆类作物有根瘤菌，有固氮作用。不仅有利于当年间种作物的增产，也提高了夏季作物的产量。果遂公社北丹大队风凤产队1958年种花生的土地，1959年利的早玉米比在种红茹和晚玉米的地里的庄稼增产七成到一倍。第三，可以调节和节省劳动力。早玉米间种黄豆，黄豆可以提前种，不至使早玉米和种红茹、秋玉米、黄豆等工作挤在一起。当种完红茹、秋玉米时，黄豆也将收获。而收完黄豆，秋玉米，红茹又将陆续收获了。这样农活互相错开。据调查，实行玉米间种黄豆或玉米间种红茹，比单种一种作物一亩地可少用四个到六个工。第四，减少杂草，增强抗旱能力。几种作物间种，高矮郁闭，阳光不能直接照射地面，杂草难以滋生，水分蒸发减少，因而能减少锄草人工，又增强抗旱能力。据县气象资料统计，今年1月至6月份，降雨量比去年同期减少了五百多公厘，但是由于大搞间种，除了部分早稻受旱外，旱地作物普遍丰收。
    中共忻城县委为了使这项新制度发挥更大的作用，最近又在全县范围内组织了一次群众性的互相参观访问，交流新经验。同时，又在全县各个公社调集贯彻这项新制度有经验的六十多名老农组成工作队，深入各类地区传授经验，以便进一步巩固、提高这项新的耕作制度，力争今年下半年取得更大的丰收。（附图片）
    青海省贵德县，经过几年试种，取得了高原种值水稻的初步经验。今年，河阴公社播种的四十多亩水稻，普遍生长良好。这是河阴公社的社员们积极加强水稻田间管理，一边拔草，一边进行根外施肥。
