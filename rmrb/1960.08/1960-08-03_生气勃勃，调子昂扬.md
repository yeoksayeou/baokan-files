Title: Vigorous and Uplifting

During this National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, after listening to reports summarizing the achievements of our country's literature and art, reviewing various representative excellent works, and then looking at the literature and art of the Western bourgeoisie and some literary and artistic works corrupted by revisionist ideas, we have an even clearer understanding: the literature and art that truly represents the proletariat is always vigorous and full of revolutionary optimism, while the modern Western bourgeoisie's art, and the art corrupted by revisionist ideas, are always dark in tone, full of pessimistic, decadent, and狂乱 moods.

Such a comparison can well reflect the life states of rising, infinitely promising classes and declining classes that will soon completely die out globally. Because writers are the ears and eyes of the class, the reaction is always strong and敏锐.

Recently, I saw two photographs that gave me a very deep contrasting impression. They both use the overlapping technique of photography to express "imagination," but the moods are worlds apart. The fine work of photography from our country depicts fireworks in front of Tiananmen Square, with the fireworks entirely composed of ears of grain and corn, meaning that the abundant harvest is like the most beautiful festive fireworks. An American "masterpiece" using the same technique depicts a grotesque image composed of overlapping cat faces and women's faces. It is entirely something that insults women, expresses淫虐,狂乱, and despair. Such a stark contrast runs through all departments of literature, drama, fine arts, and music. Aren't many Western films and literature talking about the "destruction of the world"? The Western bourgeoisie, fearing their own doomed fate, are in a state of mental collapse. They ridiculously portray their premonitions of annihilation as the "destruction of the world."

All our literature and art that are welcomed by the vast number of working people and truly follow the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers express the joy of the working masses under the leadership of the Party in shaking off their shackles and overthrowing the exploiters, the firm confidence in building socialism and communism, and the heroic spirit of striving to be masters of nature. These works promote communist morality and are filled with the revolutionary optimism of overcoming difficulties. Bright colors and uplifting tones are their characteristics. In our country, is there a book that is warmly welcomed by readers or a film that is universally loved by audiences that deviates from this keynote? No, absolutely not!

Our cause is like a red sun bursting forth from the horizon, and truly revolutionary literature and art must have a vigorous spirit that is in line with the rising class to which it belongs.

Those individual literary and artistic expressions of revisionist viewpoints can be seen as reflections of the remaining forces of the bourgeoisie in literature and art. They always carry a low and dark tone; this alone shows their blood relationship with the Western bourgeoisie. If revisionism is not the illegitimate child of the Western bourgeoisie, why would their faces and expressions have such similarities!

With what color pen do each of us depict our surging, forward-moving life? With what kind of tone do we sing the praises of our cause? Is it a bright pen or a dark pen? Is it a high-pitched voice or a low and weak tone? What kind of standpoint and what kind of worldview produce what kind of things; this is obvious. As Lu Xun said long ago: "What comes out of the water pipe is water, and what comes out of the blood vessels is blood."

    生气勃勃，调子昂扬	秦牧
    在这次全国文代大会期间，我们听了有关总结我国文学艺术成就的报告，回顾一下各种有代表性的优秀的作品，再去看一看西方资产阶级的文学艺术以及一些受修正主义思想腐蚀的文艺作品，就更加清楚地认识到：真正代表了无产阶级的文学艺术，总是生气勃勃，充满了革命乐观主义的，而现代西方资产阶级的文艺，受修正主义思想腐蚀的文艺，总是调子灰暗，充满了悲观颓废和狂乱的情调的。
    这样一对比，很可以反映出上升的、前途无限的阶级和没落的、不久即将在世界范围内完全死亡的阶级的生命状态。因为作家是阶级的耳朵和眼睛，反应总是强烈和敏锐的。
    最近看了两幅摄影，给了我很深的对比的印象。它们同样是利用摄影的重叠技法表现“想像”的东西，但是情调天差地别。我国的那一幅摄影佳作表现的是天安门前的焰火，礼花完全用谷穗、玉蜀黍组成，那意思是说：丰收的谷物就像是最美丽的节日的礼花。美国用同样技法表现的一幅摄影“名作”是用猫脸和女人的脸重叠在一起构成一个怪象。那完全是侮辱女性的、表现淫虐、狂乱、绝望精神状态的一种东西。像这种鲜明的对比，是一直贯串到文学、戏剧、美术、音乐一切部门去的。西方的许多电影和文学不是正在大谈“世界的毁灭”么？西方资产阶级由于对自己没落命运产生恐惧，精神正在崩溃，他们把自己对灭亡的预感讲成为“世界的毁灭”，实在是可笑不过的。
    我们一切为千万劳动人民所欢迎的、真正走工农兵方向的文学艺术，表现的是工农群众在党领导下挣脱枷锁打倒剥削者的欢乐，建设社会主义和共产主义的坚强信心，争取做大自然主人的豪迈气概，这些作品宣扬共产主义品德，洋溢着克服困难的革命乐观主义精神。鲜明的色彩和昂扬的调子就是它们的特色。在我国，有一本为读者所热烈欢迎的书籍、有一部为观众所普遍喜爱的影片是离开这种基调的么？没有，完全没有！
    我们的事业像一轮红日从地平线上喷薄而出，真正革命的文学艺术也就必然有一种和它所属的上升的阶级相适应的生气勃勃的精神。
    那些个别出现的表现修正主义观点的文学艺术，可以看做是资产阶级残余势力在文艺上的反映。它们总是带着一种低沉的灰暗的色调，单是这一点，也可以见到它们和西方资产阶级之间的血缘了。如果修正主义不是西方资产阶级的私生子，何以面貌神态有其相似之处！
    我们每个人是用什么色彩的笔来描绘我们奔腾前进的生活的？是用怎样的调子来歌唱我们的事业的？是鲜明的笔，还是灰暗的笔？是高亢的声音，还是低沉的无力的调门？怎样的立足点和怎样的世界观就产生怎样的东西，这是明显不过的。正像鲁迅所早已说过的：“从水管出来的都是水，从血管里出来的都是血。”
