Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 3rd: The Soviet government, in a note to the U.S. government on August 2nd, reiterated its strong protest against the intrusion of a U.S. “RB-47 type” bomber into Soviet borders on July 1st. This note is a response to the U.S. government's note of July 18, 1960. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Semyonov handed the note to U.S. Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to Moscow, Freers, on August 2nd.

In its note of July 18, the U.S. government repeated its absurd old tune, insisting that the U.S. “RB-47 type” bomber, which was shot down while intruding into Soviet territory, was "performing a legitimate mission in international airspace," studying some kind of "electromagnetic phenomena."

The Soviet government's note pointed out that the U.S. government has not provided any evidence to substantiate its claims regarding the flight of the “RB-47 type” bomber, nor could it possibly do so. The U.S. government's request for some kind of “on-site investigation” can only be regarded as a trick aimed at diverting attention from the intolerable actions of U.S. military aircraft.

The note stated that the Soviet government hopes that the U.S. government will end the U.S. Air Force's provocative actions against the Soviet Union. Otherwise, the Soviet government will take appropriate measures, as it has warned before, to ensure the safety of the Soviet people by all means at its disposal.

The note pointed out that it is quite clear that the essence of the actions of U.S. military aircraft is the same in both the May 1st U.S. plane incident and this incident, and the same unprecedented policy of intentional infringement upon the Soviet Union supports these actions. This policy was publicly announced by the U.S. government in May of this year, but it has been implementing this policy for a long time. Obviously, the U.S. government's tactics to confuse public opinion and evade responsibility for its aggressive acts have not changed. These aggressive actions crudely violate universally recognized norms of international law, intensify international tensions, and pose a threat to the cause of peace.

    苏联政府照会美国
    再次谴责美机侵苏领空
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联政府在8月2日致美国政府的照会中再次表示坚决抗议美国“RB—47型”轰炸机于7月1日侵犯苏联边境一事。这份照会是对美国政府1960年7月18日照会的复照，由苏联外交部副部长谢苗诺夫在8月2日把这份照会交给了美国驻莫斯科临时代办弗里尔斯。
    美国政府在7月18日的照会中，重弹荒谬的老调，硬说那架在侵犯苏联国境时被击落的美国“RB—47型”轰炸机是“在公海上空执行合法的任务”，研究什么“电磁现象”。
    苏联政府的照会指出，美国政府没有提出任何能证实它关于“RB—47型”轰炸机飞行情况的证据，而且也不可能提出这样的证据。美国政府提出的进行某种“当场调查”的要求，只能认为是目的在于转移人们对美国军用飞机不可容忍的行动的注意力的花招。
    照会中指出，苏联政府希望美国政府结束美国空军对苏联的挑衅行动。否则，苏联政府将像它以前警告过的那样，采取适当的措施，以便用苏联所拥有的一切手段来保证苏联人民的安全。
    照会指出，十分明显，在5月1日美国飞机事件和这次事件中，美国军用飞机的行动的实质是一样的，支持这种行动的、对苏联有意侵犯的无前例的政策也是一样的，这种政策是美国政府今年5月公开宣布的，但它实行这个政策的时间已经很久了。很明显，美国政府企图用来迷惑舆论和逃避自己的侵略行为的责任的手法没有改变，这种侵略行动粗暴地破坏了公认的国际法准则，加紧国际紧张局势和对和平事业造成威胁。
