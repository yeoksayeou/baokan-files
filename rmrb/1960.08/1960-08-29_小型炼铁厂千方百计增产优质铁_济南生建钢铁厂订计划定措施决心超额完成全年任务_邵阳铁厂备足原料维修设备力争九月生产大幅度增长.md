Small Iron and Steel Plants Strive to Increase Production of High-Quality Iron

Jinan Shengjian Steel Plant Formulates Plans and Measures to Exceed Annual Quota

Shaoyang Iron Plant Stocks Up on Raw Materials and Repairs Equipment, Striving for Substantial Production Increase in September

(Our dispatch) The workers of Jinan Shengjian Steel Plant are enthusiastically responding to the Party's call, actively carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and are determined to overfulfill the annual pig iron production plan. They have also issued a proposal to similar blast furnaces throughout Shandong Province to carry out a labor competition to increase production and practice economy.

Starting from August 16, all the workers of this plant, under the leadership of the Party committee, on the one hand, studied the Party's instructions on increasing production and practicing economy, and conscientiously checked the production and savings situation in the past seven and a half months; on the other hand, based on the spirit of being active and reliable, they formulated a plan to increase production and practice economy for the next four months. By the 19th, in three days of discussion, workers from the blast furnace, coking, mining, and raw material processing departments put forward many suggestions. They unanimously believed that the plant's pig iron production task set by the state this year could be overfulfilled with effort. Now, the entire plant has formulated targets and specific measures for increasing production and practicing economy.

Increasing the air volume into the furnace and shortening the smelting cycle are key to ensuring the realization of the overproduction plan. The workers of this plant have proposed many measures and decided to transform the blowing system to strive to increase the blowing capacity by one time, improve the smelting intensity, and shorten the smelting cycle (from raw material entering the furnace to iron tapping) from the original six to seven hours to four to five hours. The main problems now are that the cold air valve, hot air valve, and vent valve are not yet in place. To this end, the workers in the plant's machine repair workshop have proposed to use the "ants gnawing bones" method to solve the problem by themselves. The lathes, boring machines, and other tools needed for processing are also manufactured by themselves.

In order to ensure that the blast furnace eats "refined materials and cooked food," the workers in the raw material workshop voluntarily used their rest time to go to the smelting workshop of Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory several times to learn the advanced experience of mineral powder sintering, and fully utilized the established production linkage line to increase the daily output from about 300 tons in the past to about 700 tons. In terms of sintering, they tightly grasped the three technical elements of correct batching, uniform feeding, and timely air supply, so that the iron oxide was reduced by about 5%, and the iron grade was increased from 40% in the past to more than 49%. However, the workers in this workshop are not satisfied with this, and they have put forward new targets and measures for increasing production and practicing economy.

The workers in the plant's three mining areas, namely Wudingmao, Yanchishan, and Taohuayu, have also put forward plans to increase ore production. They are speeding up mining, actively looking for new mineral sources, and strengthening stripping work.

In order to realize the overproduction plan, leading cadres at all levels have fixed their divisions of labor and gone deep into every workshop, section, and job to discover and solve problems in production and life at any time.

(Our dispatch) Shaoyang Iron Plant in Hunan Province is actively preparing conditions for a substantial increase in production in September, focusing on the storage of raw materials and fuels and equipment maintenance. Now, the stock of roasted ore in the plant has greatly increased; the stock of limestone can be used for one month; and the supply of coke has also guaranteed normal production.

In grasping the preparation work, this plant has effectively strengthened the leadership over mines and transportation. Liu Chunfu, Secretary of the Shaoyang Municipal Party Committee, led the comrades of the Industrial Office of the Municipal Party Committee to establish a frontline headquarters in the plant, and worked with the plant's Party committee to go deep into the mines and furnaces to focus on the storage of raw materials and fuels. Cao Huaguang, Deputy Secretary of the Plant Party Committee, and two deputy directors established a frontline command post in the Shehushan Iron Mine area, and assigned a deputy director and the head of the supply and marketing section to specifically handle the transfer and transportation of coke and ore. In order to accelerate transportation and ensure that the blast furnace is well-fed, the Municipal Party Committee also transferred labor and vehicles from other industrial departments to support the mine. The plant's Party committee also grasped the link of the production team, fully mobilized the masses to discuss the monthly plan, and formulate measures. In this way, everyone knows what to do and everyone is full of energy. For example, the eleventh production team of the first production team in the Shehushan mining area had a task of producing 350 tons of roasted ore in August. The plan was to start loading the kiln on the 3rd, and the monthly task would be completed five days ahead of schedule. However, after being handed over to the team for discussion, they started loading the first kiln from the 1st and completed the monthly plan 16 days ahead of schedule. Under the leadership of this team, their production team has also completed the monthly plan 12 days ahead of schedule.

While focusing on high ore production, the plant's Party committee resolutely implemented the principle of giving equal importance to quantity and quality, and strived to improve the ore grade. The Party committee mobilized the masses to summarize experience and formulated operating procedures for "five checkpoints for ore selection" and "four prohibitions for ore entering the kiln." The five checkpoints are the head of the shift, mining, transportation, kiln entry, and kiln exit. The four prohibitions for kiln entry are: vein stone cannot enter; yellow mud cannot enter; low grade cannot enter; and high moisture cannot enter. This experience was fully promoted. At the same time, it organized chemical analysts to go to the mountains to take samples for analysis, and notified the analysis results to the team; each team also set up quality inspectors and launched a competition to improve quality. The ore grade of the whole plant is often maintained above 40%.

The plant also paid special attention to strengthening equipment maintenance. The plant's Party committee organized a "three-way combination" equipment inspection team to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the plant's equipment, made maintenance plans for each piece of equipment, and transferred 15 technicians from the mechanical and electrical workshop to the blast furnace workshop to form a maintenance team; the Municipal Party Committee transferred 30 technicians to support the strengthening of the technical maintenance force.

    小型炼铁厂千方百计增产优质铁
    济南生建钢铁厂订计划定措施决心超额完成全年任务
    邵阳铁厂备足原料维修设备力争九月生产大幅度增长
    本报讯　济南生建钢铁厂职工热烈响应党的号召，积极开展增产节约运动，决心超额完成全年生铁生产计划。他们还向山东全省同型高炉发出倡议，开展增产节约劳动竞赛。
    8月16日起，这个厂的全体职工，在党委领导下，一方面学习党的增产节约指示，认真检查过去七个半月的生产和节约情况；一方面根据积极可靠的精神，制订今后四个多月的增产节约计划。到19日，在三天讨论中，高炉、焦化、采矿、原料处理等生产部门的职工提出了许多建议。他们一致认为，今年国家规定的该厂生铁生产任务，经过努力可以超额完成。现在，全厂已订出了增产节约的指标和具体措施。
    加大入炉风量，缩短冶炼周期，是保证实现超产计划的关键。这个厂职工们已提出了许多措施，决定要把鼓风系统加以改造，争取增加一倍的鼓风能力，提高冶炼强度，使冶炼周期（从原料入炉到出铁）从原来的六到七小时缩短到四到五小时。现在的主要问题是冷风阀、热风阀、放风阀还没有着落。为此，该厂机修车间职工已提出用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，自己动手来解决。所需加工用的车床、搪床等工具也由自己动手制造。
    原料车间的职工为了保证高炉吃到“精料熟食”，自动地利用休息时间，几次到济南印染厂冶炼车间去学习矿粉烧结的先进经验，并把已经建成的生产联动线充分运用起来，使日产量由过去三百吨左右提高到七百吨左右。在烧结方面，他们紧紧掌握了正确配料、上料均匀、及时送风的三个技术要素，使氧化铁减少了5％左右，含铁品位由过去的40％提高到49％以上。但是，这个车间的职工并不以此为满足，他们又提出新的增产节约的指标和措施。
    这个厂所属的五顶帽、砚池山、桃花峪等三个矿区职工，也都提出了增产矿石的计划。一面加速开采，一面积极地寻找新的矿源，加强剥离工作。
    为了实现超产计划，各级领导干部已经固定分工深入到每一个车间、工段和工种，随时发现和解决生产、生活中的问题。
    本报讯　湖南省邵阳市铁厂积极为9月大幅度增产准备条件，狠抓原料、燃料的储备和设备维修。现在，厂内储备的经过焙烧的熟矿石已大大增加；石灰石的储备可供使用一月；焦炭供应也保证了正常生产。
    这个厂在抓准备工作中，切实加强了对矿山、运输的领导。邵阳市委书记刘春富同志带领市委工业办公室的同志，在厂里建立了前线指挥部，和厂党委一起深入矿山、炉旁，狠抓原料、燃料的储备。厂党委副书记曹华光和两个副厂长在佘湖山铁矿工区建立了前线指挥所，并以一个副厂长和供销科长专抓焦、矿的调运。为了加速运输，保证高炉吃饱，市委又从其他工业部门抽调了劳力和汽车支援矿山。厂党委并抓住生产班组这一环节，充分发动群众讨论月计划，制定措施。这样，人人心中有数，个个干劲冲天。例如佘湖山工区第一生产队十一生产班，8月份的任务是生产三百五十吨熟矿，计划安排是三号开始装窑，全月任务提前五天完成。可是交给班组讨论后，从一号起就开始装第一窑，并且提前十六天完成了月计划。在这个班的带动下，他们所在的生产小队也已提前十二天完成了月计划。
    在大抓矿石高产同时，厂党委又坚决贯彻执行了产量、质量并举的方针，努力提高矿石品位。党委发动群众总结经验，制定了“选矿过五关”、“矿石四不入窑”的操作规程。五关是垱头关、采矿关、运输关、入窑关、出窑关。四不入窑是：?石不入；有黄泥不入；品位过低不入；水分重不入。并把这一经验全面推广。同时，组织化验人员上山取料化验，并将化验结果通知到班；各班也设立了质量检验员，展开了提高质量的竞赛，全厂矿石品位经常保持在40％以上。
  该厂还特别注意加强设备维修。厂党委组织了“三结合”设备检查组，对全厂设备进行了全面检查，逐台设备作了维修计划，并且从机电车间调了十五个技工到高炉车间成立维护组；市委又调了三十个技工来支援，加强了维修的技术力量。
