    Working Underground is a Revolution in Coal Mine Enterprise Management
    Xing Guangxin, Secretary of the Yutianpu Coal Mine Committee of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    Since May of this year, we have implemented the system of working underground. This is a revolution in the leadership style and enterprise management work, and a revolutionary measure to adjust the internal production relations of the enterprise and promote the development of productive forces. It has powerfully promoted the sustained leap forward in production in our mine. In the first half of this year, the total output of raw coal in the mine increased by 69% compared with the same period last year, and in May and June there was an even greater increase in coal and coke production.

          (I)

    Chairman Mao said: After the problem of ownership is solved, "socialist relations of production have been established, which are adapted to the development of productive forces; however, they are still very imperfect, and these imperfect aspects are in contradiction with the development of productive forces. In addition to this situation of adaptation and contradiction between relations of production and the development of productive forces, there is also the situation of adaptation and contradiction between the superstructure and the economic base." The actual situation in our mine confirms Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis. In the past few years, our mine has conscientiously implemented the policy of adhering to putting politics in command, ensuring the absolute leadership of the Party over enterprises, and carrying out mass movements in a big way, relying on the working class to manage socialist enterprises well, and has carried out a series of reforms in management work; we have adhered to the implementation of the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," the system of cadres working alongside workers, and "cultivating experimental plots," constantly adjusting the relations of production and promoting the development of productive forces. Two years of continuous great leap forward have resulted in an increase of nearly three times in the total output of raw coal; the output of raw coal in 1959 increased thirty-four times compared with 1949. However, this does not mean that there are no problems at all. There are still situations of incomplete adaptation between productive forces and relations of production, and between the superstructure and the economic base. For example, there are still some residual influences of the old relations of production in the enterprise leadership style and enterprise management work. The management system and leadership methods of "production underground, command on the surface" is the concentrated expression of this residual influence. In the past, although we adopted leadership methods such as cadres going down the well to cultivate "experimental plots," working alongside workers, and directing production at the underground site, these leadership methods have not been fully popularized and regularized. Cadres went down the well more often when organizing high-yield or crash tasks, but less often at other times, and the regular command work was still on the surface, accustomed to sitting in the office and relying on meetings, reports and telephones to command production. The management system and leadership methods of "production underground, command on the surface" have not fundamentally changed. Under the situation of continued leap forward, production develops quickly, and new problems appear frequently. Especially coal mine production, which has the characteristics of underground operations, long front lines, many types of work, many links, large changes, and work locations that are both scattered and frequently moving, the management system and leadership methods of "production underground, command on the surface" are increasingly incompatible with the leap forward situation. This management system and leadership methods hinder the further improvement of the relationship between cadres and the masses, and hinder the development of productive forces at a higher speed. This is a contradiction between the relations of production and the development of productive forces within the enterprise. Of course, this contradiction belongs to the non-antagonistic contradiction among the people on the basis of the fundamental interests of the working class being consistent.

    Establishing underground offices and implementing a complete set of cadres from the political and ideological work and management departments to work underground is to first recognize the existence of contradictions within the enterprise, and then consciously and continuously adjust the relations of production to resolve these contradictions, so as to promote the sustained and high-speed development of productive forces.

    The underground office refers to the establishment of a formal and fixed production command organization for political and ideological work and management work underground, with cadres from the Party, Youth League, and trade union systems, as well as well captains, production team leaders, technicians, wellhead dispatch stations, material warehouses, mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance and repair workers (including electricians, fitters, and telephone workers), and medical and health stations working underground, forming an underground production combat headquarters, working in shifts day and night. The specific approach to implementing this new leadership system is: dividing the original administrative departments and Party and mass departments of each well into two major parts, underground and aboveground, with the underground part responsible for the direct command of daily and shift production tasks; the aboveground part is responsible for relatively long-term production plans, raw material supply, labor allocation, employee life, cultural education, and scientific research. The first and second lines, long-term arrangements and daily and shift production leadership, have both division of labor and close connections; and the second line serves the first line. The specific tasks of the underground production combat headquarters are: (1) Strengthen on-site production management and political and ideological work, and organize the balance and collaboration of mining, tunneling, and transportation production links. (2) Lead the completion of the production tasks of the current shift, and prepare for the production of the next shift. (3) Grasp the key points and focus on weak links. (4) Strengthen group work, organize and lead the "eight major members" of the production group to participate in production management. (5) Go to work and get off work with the workers, labor together, and discuss together. (6) Grasp safety and ensure safe production. The underground duty personnel go to work early to understand the situation of the working face, and then participate in the shift pre-meeting held by the workers underground to carry out combat mobilization, explain the situation to the workers, and explain the tasks and measures. After work, they participate in the workers' evaluation meeting, commend the advanced, and help the workers summarize their experiences and lessons. In the production process, cadres use the working method of "combining points and surface," both patrolling the working faces to understand the overall situation, and going deep into key and weak links to "squat," working alongside workers, and specifically helping to solve problems.

            (II)

    The underground is the front line of coal mine production, the place where the broad masses carry out production struggles, and the site for concretely implementing the Party's guidelines and policies and completing various production targets. Implementing the system of working underground and going to the production front line is not a simple change of command location, but a major principle issue of adhering to the Party's Marxist-Leninist leadership style and leadership methods. Correct working methods are one of the important conditions for completing revolutionary tasks. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We must not only put forward tasks, but also solve the problem of how to complete them. Our task is to cross the river, but we cannot cross without a bridge or a boat. Without solving the problem of the bridge or the boat, crossing the river is empty talk. Without solving the problem of method, the task is just a lot of nonsense." There are two methods for doing any work: one is the materialistic, mass line working method, that is, the fast and good method; the other is the subjective, bureaucratic working method, that is, the slow and poor method. The former is a promoting method, and the latter is a demoting method. Production practice has proved that the underground office system is a promoting method. Therefore, it has been warmly praised by the broad masses of employees. Coal miner Liu Renxing wrote a poem praising: "The method of underground command and dispatch is wonderful, solving key problems quickly and well; the leadership goes deep into the front line, and the production outlook has greatly changed."

    When leaders leave the office and go to the production front line, and together with the employees, jointly study and discuss the actual things in front of them on the spot, they can better communicate the ideas between the leadership and the masses, and between superiors and subordinates, so that everyone has the same understanding and the same actions. In this way, all positive factors can be mobilized and people's wisdom can be fully utilized. For example, on July 9, during the middle shift of the 4301 working face of the No. 3 Well, the coal eye was stuck by a large stone, and the production of the entire working face was interrupted. At that time, the cadres could not come up with a good solution to the problem. What to do? Branch Committee Member and Production Team Leader Comrade Zhao Shiquan held an expanded meeting of the "front line" Party group to study the matter on the spot. The meeting was very enthusiastic, with everyone chiming in. Communist Party member and veteran worker You Bingquan said: "The top plate surface of the coal eye is stuck by a large stone, so let's punch a 'hair hole' on the bottom plate surface to let the coal down." After discussion by the group, his suggestion was unanimously approved. As a result, 304 tons of coal were produced that shift, exceeding the plan by 70 tons. After the cadres went down the well, they also paid attention to strengthening group work. In June, two-thirds of the coal mining groups in the mine reached the level of red flag working faces. Among the 38 groups in the No. 3 Well, 32 groups reached the advanced level, accounting for 84%, completely eliminating the backward groups that failed to complete the plan, and realizing "all red" in group work.

    Leading cadres go to the well to work, devote themselves to practice, so that the subjective can better conform to the objective, and the handling of problems can be based on reality, avoiding subjectivism. Leaders go deep among the masses and better combine with the masses, which also avoids bureaucracy. For example, on the middle shift of June 7, at the 3302 lower section coal mining working face of the No. 2 Well, shortly after the workers went to work, they found that the roof was under particularly heavy pressure. The production team leader on duty proposed to stop coal mining and carry out roof caving. The well captain on duty rushed to the scene to inspect and found that the broken head crack was completely close to the working face. After studying with the workers, he believed that if the roof was caved immediately, there was a risk of damaging the working face, so he decided to accelerate the mining of two meters, avoid the broken head crack, and then cave the roof. Sure enough, when the roof was caved after mining two meters, the roof collapsed completely and neatly along the broken head crack. This not only ensured the output, but also avoided the accident of roof caving damaging the working face.

    After the cadres go deep into the front line and the material warehouse and equipment maintenance and repair workers and other sets of teams go to the well, many problems can be discovered and solved on the spot, avoiding the phenomenon of wasting production time back and forth from the ground to the well in the past. Many cadres deeply realized that: in the past, when they were on duty on the ground and listened to reports, sometimes their understanding of the situation was ambiguous, so some problems in production could not be solved in time; now they see it with their own eyes, do it with the masses, and solve problems more solidly and specifically. Cadres and technicians going to the well also promote the more regular and universal "three combinations," greatly promoting the development of the technical revolution movement. Recently, the secretary of the Transportation Branch of the No. 3 Well used the "Zhuge Liang meeting" of the "three combinations" in the well to successfully research and trial-produce a semi-automatic "car stopper," which solved a major technical problem that had not been solved for many years.

    Due to the establishment of this materialistic leadership method and mass line leadership style, a new atmosphere of "four more, four less, three same, two fast, and one improvement" has appeared in the mine. The "four more and four less" are: fewer people are busy with trivial matters on the ground, and more people are going to the well to do specific work; fewer people are running around and busy making phone calls to ask for numbers and busy holding meetings, and more people are going deep into production, going deep among the masses, understanding the situation, studying problems, and solving problems; fewer people are pointing fingers and talking empty words; more people are seeking truth from facts to think of ways and give ideas; less people are shirking responsibility and procrastinating without solving problems, and more people are taking measures and solving problems on the spot. The "three same" are: cadres and workers go to work and get off work at the same time, work together, and discuss and study problems together. The "two fast" are: problems are discovered faster, and problems are solved faster. The "one improvement" is that the relationship between leaders and the masses has been further improved. Everyone, from top to bottom, left and right, is united and making concerted efforts to achieve continued leap forward. The implementation of working underground also makes political and ideological work more in-depth and meticulous, planting the red flag of the proletariat in every corner of production in the well, thus greatly improving the communist consciousness of the broad masses of employees. The strengthening of political and ideological work and management work underground has also led to cadres going to dormitories and canteens to do political and ideological work, forming the "three down" system of political work going down to the mines, workshops, and kitchens. Cadres at all levels have not only gone deep to grasp production, but also grasped life meticulously.

          (III)

    Like other new things, the process of growth, consolidation, and improvement of the new leadership method of the underground office system is a process of struggle between old and new ideas.

    In April of this year, when we were implementing the spirit of the Sixth-Level Cadre Conference of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, we proposed to work underground. At that time, the vast majority of employees warmly welcomed and supported it. However, a few cadres also had some ideological concerns. Some people thought: "If you grasp the underground, you can't grasp the ground"; others were afraid of hardship and unwilling to work underground for a long time and participate in labor, and so on. The mine Party committee and the general branches of each well extensively discussed the situation and repeatedly explained the importance of improving leadership style and leadership methods under the situation of continued leap forward. They organized and carried out a debate on "How can leadership work adapt to the new situation of continued leap forward?" and "Is it better to command production on the ground or underground?" so that cadres at all levels clearly realized ideologically that working underground is the requirement of the situation, the requirement of the masses, and the requirement of implementing the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. While carrying out ideological education, the Party committee first conducted a pilot project in one well, adopting the method of testing everything and gradually promoting it comprehensively, taking out models and using living people, living things, and living principles to educate cadres, improve understanding, and strengthen confidence. Practice has proved that if the underground office system is to be implemented well and thoroughly, the leadership of the Party must be strengthened and politics must be put in command.

    Under the guidance of the idea of "if the direction is correct, we must persevere to the end," after implementing the underground office system, we adopted a series of organizational measures to support the growth, consolidation, and improvement of this new leadership method. First, we strengthened group work, delegated part of the rights to the production groups, reduced the cumbersome affairs of the leading organs, and enabled leaders at all levels to squeeze out more time to go to the well to command production and study major issues. Second, cadres at the mine-level organs implemented the "two-five" system, that is, they spent five days a week going deep into the front line and participating in labor, and two days holding meetings and studying. Third, regarding the implementation of political work going down to the well, management work going down to the well, and the establishment of the underground office system, the Party committee specially discussed and made a resolution, mobilizing all Party members to take the lead in implementing it; and incorporating it into the new management system to ensure its realization from the organizational system. After the Party committee made a resolution, the Party committee members took the lead in implementing it, assigning work to each well to go deep into the front line, participate in production, and lead production. Each section and department, according to its own business nature, implemented the method of "letting go, packaging up, and pushing production up," fixing a working face or a group as its own "experimental plot," and working alongside workers. Fourth, we carried out a "five good" (good in putting politics in command, good in implementing the Party's guidelines and policies, good in working underground to complete tasks, good in labor, good in contacting the masses, and good in studying) cadre competition, and regularly evaluated "five good" cadres, inserted red flags, and set up pacesetters. After the above work, the new leadership method of the underground office has been universalized and regularized in our mine, and has been further developed and improved.

    Although the time for our mine to implement the underground office system is not long, its superiority in production work has shown great vitality. We are determined to continuously improve and improve this leadership method in practice, so that our work style and working methods are more in line with the needs of the situation and promote the development of production.

    井下办公是煤矿企业管理的一个革命	中共重庆市鱼田堡煤矿委员会书记　邢广信
    今年5月以来，我们实行了井下办公制度。这是企业领导作风和企业管理工作上的一个革命，是调整企业内部生产关系，促进生产力发展的革命措施。它有力地推动了我们矿生产持续跃进。今年上半年，全矿原煤总产量比去年同期提高69％，5、6两月出现了煤焦生产更大幅度的增长。
          （一）
    毛主席说：在所有制问题解决以后，“社会主义生产关系已经建立起来，它是和生产力的发展相适应的；但是，它又还很不完善，这些不完善的方面和生产力的发展又是相矛盾的。除了生产关系和生产力发展的这种又相适应又相矛盾的情况以外，还有上层建筑和经济基础的又相适应又相矛盾的情况。”我们矿的实际情形，就证实了毛主席这个英明的论断。几年来，我们矿认真贯彻执行了坚持政治挂帅，保证党对企业的绝对领导和大搞群众运动，依靠工人阶级管好社会主义企业的方针，在管理工作上进行了一系列的改革；我们坚持贯彻了
  “两参一改三结合”、干部跟班劳动和“种试验田”的制度，不断地调整了生产关系，促进了生产力的发展。两年连续大跃进，原煤总产量提高了近三倍；1959年原煤产量比1949年提高三十四倍。但是，这并不是说就完全没有问题了。在生产力与生产关系之间，上层建筑与经济基础之间，也还有不完全相适应的情况。例如，在企业领导作风和企业管理工作方面还存在着某些旧的生产关系的残余影响。“井下生产，地面指挥”的管理制度和领导方法，就是这个残余影响的集中表现。我们过去虽然采用了干部下井种“试验田”、跟班劳动、到井下现场指挥生产等领导方法。但是，这些领导方法还没有完全普遍化、经常化。干部在组织高产或突击任务的时候下井较多，平时就少，而经常性的指挥工作，仍然是在地面上，习惯于坐办公室，依靠会议、汇报和电话来指挥生产。“井下生产，地面指挥”的管理制度和领导方法没有根本改变。在继续跃进的形势下，生产发展快，新问题出现得多。特别是煤矿生产，具有地下作业、战线长、工种多、环节多、变化大、工作地点既分散又经常移动等特点，“井下生产，地面指挥”的管理制度和领导方法越来越显得同跃进形势不相适应。这种管理制度和领导方法，既妨碍着干群关系的进一步改善，又妨碍着生产力以更高的速度向前发展。这就是企业内部生产关系与生产力不相适应的一种矛盾。当然，这种矛盾是属于工人阶级内部根本利益一致基础上的非对抗性的人民内部矛盾。
    设立井下办公室，实行政治思想工作、管理工作的一整套班子下井办公，就是首先承认企业内部存在矛盾，进一步自觉地不断调整生产关系，来解决这些矛盾，以便促进生产力持续高速度发展。
    井下办公室，是指在井下建立正规的固定的政治思想工作、管理工作的生产指挥机构，党、团、工会系统的干部和井长、生产组长、技术人员、井口调度站、材料库房、机电设备维护检修工（包括电工、钳工和电话工）、医疗保健站等一整套班子都下井工作，组成井下生产战斗指挥部，日夜轮流值班。实行这一新的领导制度的具体作法是：将原来各井行政部门、党群部门分为井上井下两大部分，井下部分担负每日每班生产的直接指挥任务；井上部分负责比较长期的生产计划、原材料供应、劳动力调配、职工生活、文化教育和科学研究等工作。第一线和第二线、长期安排和每日每班的生产领导，既有分工，又紧密联系；而第二线为第一线服务。井下生产战斗指挥部的具体任务是：（1）加强生产现场管理工作和政治思想工作，组织采、掘、运等生产环节的平衡和协作。（2）领导完成当班的生产任务，并为下班的生产作好准备工作。（3）抓关键，突击薄弱环节。（4）加强小组工作，组织和领导生产小组的“八大员”参加生产管理。（5）和工人同上、下班，同劳动，同商量。（6）抓安全，保证安全生产。井下每班值班人员提前上班了解工作面情况，然后参加工人在井下召开的班前会议，进行战斗动员，向工人讲形势，交代任务和措施，下班后参加工人评比会，表扬先进，帮助工人总结经验教训。在生产过程中，干部运用“点面结合”的工作方法，既巡回各工作面了解全面情况，又深入重点和薄弱环节“蹲点”，跟班劳动，具体帮助解决问题。
            （二）
    井下，是煤矿生产的第一线，是广大群众进行生产斗争的场所，是具体贯彻执行党的方针政策，完成各项生产指标的现场。实行井下办公制度，到生产第一线去，这不是简单的指挥场所的变换问题，而是坚持党的马克思列宁主义的领导作风和领导方法的重大原则问题。正确的工作方法是完成革命任务的重要条件之一。毛泽东同志说过：“我们不但要提出任务，而且要解决完成任务的方法问题。我们的任务是过河，但是没有桥或没有船就不能过。不解决桥或船的问题，过河就是一句空话。不解决方法问题，任务也只是瞎说一顿。”作任何工作，可以有两种方法：一是唯物主义、群众路线的工作方法，即又快又好的方法；另一种是主观主义、官僚主义的工作方法，即又慢又差的方法。前者是促进的方法，后者是促退的方法。生产实践证明，井下办公制度就是一个促进的方法。因此，它受到了广大职工群众的热烈赞扬。采煤工人刘仁兴写诗歌颂：“井下指挥调度办法妙，解决关键问题快又好；领导深入第一线，生产面貌大改变。”
    领导人员离开办公室，到生产第一线去，和职工群众一起，在现场上对摆在眼前的实际事物进行共同的研究和讨论，可以更好地沟通领导和群众、上级和下级之间的思想，使大家认识一致，行动一致。从而把一切积极因素都调动起来，把人们的智慧充分发挥出来。如7月9日，三井四三○一工作面中班下煤眼子被大石头卡住了，整个工作面的生产陷于中断。当时干部也拿不出解决问题的好办法。怎么办？  支部委员、生产组长赵世全同志召开了“火线”党小组扩大会议，当场进行研究。会议开得很热烈，七嘴八舌，你一言我一语。共产党员、老工人尤丙全说：“下煤眼子的天板面被大石头卡住了，就朝底板面冲个‘毛洞’下煤。”经小组讨论，一致同意了他的建议。结果当班出煤三百零四吨，超额七十吨完成了计划。干部下井以后，还注意加强了小组工作。6月份，全矿有三分之二的采煤小组达到了红旗工作面的水平。三井的三十八个小组中，达到先进水平的小组有三十二个，占84％，完全消灭了完不成计划的落后小组，实现了小组工作“满堂红”。
    领导干部下井办公，投身于实践，使主观能更好地符合客观，处理问题更能从实际出发，避免主观主义。领导深入群众，和群众更好地结合，也避免了官僚主义。例如，6月7日中班，二井三三零二下段采煤工作面，工人们上班后不久，发现顶板受到特别沉重的压力，当班生产组长提出要停止采煤进行落顶。值班井长马上赶赴现场检查，发现断头裂缝已完全靠近工作面，同工人共同研究认为，如果立即落顶，有破坏工作面的危险，于是决定加速采通两米，躲过断头裂缝以后再落顶。果真，采通两米后进行落顶时，顶板就完全整齐地沿断头裂缝陷落下来。这样既保证了产量，又避免了落顶破坏工作面的事故。
    干部深入第一线，材料库和设备维护检修工等一套班子下井以后，许多问题能够就地发现，就地解决，避免了以往从地面到井下往返耽误生产时间的现象。许多干部深刻体会到：过去在地面值班听汇报，有些时候对情况的了解是似是而非的，因而有些生产中的问题不能及时解决；现在是亲眼见，亲手和群众一起干，解决问题就更加扎实具体。干部、技术人员下井，还促使“三结合”更加经常化、普遍化，大大推动了技术革命运动的发展。最近三井运输支部书记就在井下运用“三结合”的“诸葛亮会”，研究试制成功了半自动化的“挡车器”，解决了多年没有解决的重大技术问题。
    由于建立了这种唯物主义的领导方法和群众路线的领导作风，全矿出现了“四多，四少，三同，两快，一改善”的新气象。“四多四少”是：在地面忙乱搞琐碎事务的人少了，下井作具体工作的人多了；东奔西转、忙于打电话要数字和忙于开会的人少了，深入生产、深入群众、了解情况、研究问题、解决问题的人多了；指手划脚说空话的人少了；实事求是地想办法、出主意的人多了；互相推诿、拖拖拉拉不解决问题的少了，采取措施、就地解决问题的多了。“三同”是：干部和工人同上下班，同劳动，同商量研究问题。“两快”是：发现问题快了，解决问题快了。“一改善”是领导和群众的关系进一步改善了。上下左右都一条心、一股劲地实现继续跃进。实行井下办公，还使政治思想工作做得更加深入细致，把无产阶级的思想红旗插到井下每一个生产角落，因而大大提高了职工群众的共产主义觉悟。井下政治思想工作和管理工作的加强，也带动了干部到宿舍、食堂作政治思想工作，形成政治工作下矿井、下工房、下厨房的“三下”制度。各级干部作到了不仅深入抓生产，而且细致地抓生活。
          （三）
    和其他新生事物一样，井下办公制度这一新的领导方法的成长、巩固、提高的过程，是一场新旧思想的斗争过程。
    今年4月，我们在贯彻执行中共四川省委六级干部会议精神时，提出要下井办公。当时，绝大部分职工是热烈欢迎和拥护的。但是，少数干部也有一些思想顾虑。有人认为：“抓了井下，就抓不了地面”；也有少数人怕艰苦，不愿长期下井值班和参加劳动，等等。矿党委和各井总支便大讲形势，反复说明在继续跃进的形势下，改进领导作风、改进领导方法的重要性，组织开展了“领导工作如何适应继续跃进的新形势”、“是地面指挥生产好，还是井下指挥生产好”的鸣放辩论，使各级干部从思想上明确认识到下井办公是形势的要求，群众的要求，是贯彻执行多快好省方针的要求。在进行思想教育的同时，党委先在一井试点，采取一切经过试验，逐步全面推广的办法，拿出样板，用活人活事活道理来教育干部，提高认识，坚定信心。实践证明：井下办公制度要执行好，推行彻底，必须加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅。
    在“方向对头，就要坚持到底”思想的指导下，我们在实行井下办公制度以后，采取了一系列组织措施来扶持这一新的领导方法的成长和巩固、提高。首先加强了小组工作，将一部分权利下放给生产小组，减少领导机关的繁琐事务，使各级领导干部能挤出更多的时间下井指挥生产，研究重大问题。第二、矿级机关干部实行“二五”制，即每星期有五天的时间深入第一线，参加劳动，有两天开会、学习。第三、关于实行政治工作下井，管理工作下井，建立井下办公制度，党委专门讨论作出决议，动员全体党员带头贯彻执行；并把它纳入新的管理制度，从组织制度上来保证实现。党委作出决议以后，党委委员首先带头执行，分工到各井深入第一线，参加生产领导生产。各科室部门按自己的业务性质，实行“放下去，包起来，把生产突上去”的办法，固定一个工作面或一个小组作为自己的“试验田”，跟班劳动。第四、开展“五好”（政治挂帅、贯彻执行党的方针政策好，下井办公完成任务好，劳动好，联系群众好，学习好）干部竞赛，定期评比“五好”干部，插红旗，树标兵。通过上述工作以后，井下办公这一新的领导方法，已经在我们矿作到了普遍化，经常化，并且有了进一步的发展、提高。
    我们矿虽然实行井下办公制度的时间不长，但是，它在生产工作中发挥的优越性，已经显示出了巨大的生命力。我们决心在实践中不断地改进和提高这一领导方法，使我们的工作作风和工作方法更加合乎形势的需要，促进生产的发展。
