Daye Steel Plant Forging Workshop Achieves Monthly Comprehensive Leap Forward in Production Since Last Year

(Our newspaper's report from Wuhan, August 14th) Leading cadres at the level of workshop foremen and above at Daye Steel Plant's forging workshop have been assigned to go deep into groups. In the process of participating in labor and cultivating "experimental plots," they have adopted the method of "four packages and one friendship," specifically and meticulously solving the problems of workers in each group in terms of ideology, production, and life, enabling the workshop to achieve a monthly comprehensive leap forward in production since last year. In the first half of this year, they completed the state plan ahead of schedule and comprehensively. The production plan for July was also completed three days ahead of schedule, with a product quality pass rate of 99.995%, and other indicators were also completed well. Since the third quarter of last year, the workshop has been named the national forging steel system competition champion four times in a row.

The specific contents of the "four packages" are: to take responsibility for the ideological work of the group; to ensure that the core strength of the group is fully utilized; to ensure that the group's indicators are comprehensively completed; and to ensure breakthroughs in the group's key production areas. The "one friendship" is to be a trusted friend of the workers. After the workshop's leading cadres went deep into the groups, they first focused on ideology, strengthened the core leadership of the work team, and when they discovered that employees had ideological problems, they conducted philosophical debates, held forums and visits, and carried out meticulous ideological work. For example, some leading members of Xiao Gongshun's group showed signs of fearing difficulties at the beginning of this year, and the group was not united enough. After Li Chengmin, a member of the Party branch committee, went deep into this group, he helped to convene a meeting of the group's core members and carried out a "battlefield rectification" to eliminate the fear of difficulties and disunity. The group completed the plan well in the first half of the year, and also overfulfilled the production plan for July, with a quality rate of 100%. There used to be a relatively backward group in the workshop that consistently failed to complete its plans. The Party branch transferred Party member Li Renqing to be the group leader, and He Shunxian, the secretary of the Party branch, also went to this group to cultivate "experimental plots," participate in labor, strengthen ideological leadership, and improve the workers' confidence in catching up with the advanced. Since mid-July, the group's outlook has undergone a major change, and it has been able to complete its plans every day.

Leading cadres who go deep into the groups also focus on key production areas, help the groups to overcome difficulties, and achieve a comprehensive leap forward. For example, the output of Yang Jinzhuang's group was not high in March and April, and there were also many steel decarburization accidents, with an average quality rate of only 98.7%. Leading cadres of the workshop went deep into this group, worked with the workers to study ways to improve output and quality, and adopted nineteen major measures to prevent and eliminate steel decarburization accidents, so that output increased month by month and quality improved rapidly. In May, the quality of this group reached 99.995%, and in June and July it further rose to 100%, achieving two consecutive months of no defective products.

In addition to going deep into the front line of production every day, the leading cadres of this workshop also visit workers' families and dormitories every Monday and Thursday afternoon to help solve problems in life. This practice has been adhered to since the third quarter of last year, and has successively solved many life problems for workers, such as heatstroke prevention and cooling, canteens, and diseases, which has made the relationship between cadres and the masses even closer. Leading cadres can not only promptly discover all key problems in production, but also understand the ideological situation and living conditions of employees very well.

After going deep into the groups, the eleven members of the Party branch of this workshop have all made two to three trusted friends among the workers. The entire workshop has achieved unity of mind and purpose, one heart, one mind, and worked together to strive for the top. At present, 88% of the work teams in this workshop have become advanced work teams, and advanced workers are emerging in large numbers. (Attached picture)

### 包思想工作　包加强小组领导　包突破关键　包完成各项指标  领导干部深入基层全面抓小组  大冶钢厂锻造车间去年以来实现生产月月全面跃进

    包思想工作　包加强小组领导　包突破关键　包完成各项指标
    领导干部深入基层全面抓小组
    大冶钢厂锻造车间去年以来实现生产月月全面跃进
    本报武汉14日电　大冶钢厂锻造车间工长以上的领导干部分工深入小组，在参加劳动、种“试验田”的过程中，采取“四包一交”的办法，具体细致地解决各小组工人的思想、生产、生活等各个方面的问题，使这个车间从去年以来实现了生产月月全面跃进。他们在今年上半年提前全面完成了国家计划，7月份的生产计划又提前三天完成，产品质量合格率达到99.995％，其他指标也都完成得很好。这个车间从去年第三季度以来，连续四次被评为全国锻钢系统竞赛冠军。
    “四包”的具体内容是：包小组的思想工作；包小组核心力量充分发挥作用；包小组指标全面完成；包突破小组的生产关键。“一交”是同工人交知心朋友。车间领导干部深入小组以后，都首先抓思想，加强班组核心领导，发现职工有思想问题，就务虚辩论，座谈访问，细致入微地进行思想工作。例如，肖功顺小组部分领导成员今年年初表现有畏难情绪；组内不够团结。党支部委员李成敏深入到这个小组以后，帮助召开小组核心会，开展“战地整风”，消除了畏难情绪和不团结现象。这个小组上半年计划完成得很好；7月份产量计划也超额完成，质量达到100％。这个车间原来有一个比较落后的小组，计划一直完不成。党支部把党员李人庆调去当组长，党支部书记何顺贤也到这个组种“试验田”，参加劳动，加强思想领导，提高工人赶先进的信心。7月中旬以后，这个小组面貌大变，天天都能完成计划。
    领导干部深入小组，都狠抓生产关键，帮助小组攻关，实现全面跃进。例如，杨金庄小组3、4两月产量不高，钢材脱炭事故也多，质量平均只达到98.7％。车间领导干部深入到这个小组，同工人一起研究提高产量和质量的办法，采取了十九项重大措施，防止和消灭钢材脱炭事故，使产量逐月上升，质量迅速提高。5月份，这个小组的质量达到99.995％，6、7两月更上升到100％，实现了连续两月无废品。
    这个车间的领导干部除了每天深入生产第一线以外，还在每星期一、四下午访问工人家庭和宿舍，帮助解决生活方面的问题。从去年第三季度以来，一直坚持这种做法，先后为工人解决了防暑降温、食堂、疾病等许多生活方面的问题，这就更使干部和群众结成了水乳交融的关系。领导干部不仅能够及时发现一切生产上的关键问题，而且对职工的思想情况和生活情况也都很了解。
    在深入小组以后，这个车间党支部的十一名委员都在工人中交上了两个到三个知心朋友。全车间作到了同心同德，一条心，一股劲，齐心协力争上游。现在，这个车间已有88％的班组成为先进班组，先进工人也成批涌现。（附图片）
