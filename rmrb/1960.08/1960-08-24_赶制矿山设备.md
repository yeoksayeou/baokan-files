Rushing to produce mining equipment and accelerating the technical transformation of the mining industry is an important task for employees in the machinery industry during the current campaign to increase production and practice economy.

To increase steel production, coal and ore must come first. Vigorously carrying out technical transformation of existing mines, gradually replacing manual labor with advanced production tools, and improving the level of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation in the production process is the fastest and most effective way to increase the production of coal and ore. The level of mechanization in China's general mines was originally relatively low. In small mines, the proportion of heavy manual labor is even greater. Under these circumstances, arming the mines with machinery can achieve the goal of increasing production without increasing manpower, and even reducing manpower. For example, a three-cubic-meter excavator can replace the work of 750 people per shift, saving more than 2,000 laborers per day. For example, three traction locomotives can replace the manual carrying of about 10,000 people. It can be seen from this how important it is to rush to produce mechanical equipment for mines as much and as quickly as possible to improve mine production efficiency and save labor.

In order to give priority to the development of the mining industry, the production of mining equipment has greatly developed this year. The machinery manufacturing departments in many regions, while vigorously supporting agriculture, have launched a mass movement to support the mining industry and rush to produce mining equipment. However, the production of mining equipment still cannot keep up with the demand. Especially after the development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the steel industry's demand for coal and ore will further increase, which requires the machinery industry to supply more and better mining equipment as soon as possible. Now more than half of the third quarter has passed, and a large amount of equipment must be completed in the remaining four months. Therefore, each enterprise undertaking this task needs to immediately organize all employees to discuss the plan to increase production and practice economy, formulate monthly, ten-day, and daily production progress indicators for mining equipment, and strive to overfulfill these indicators with concrete measures.

Among the measures to rush to produce mining equipment, an important one is that the relevant departments, regions, and enterprises, in accordance with the spirit of the whole country acting as a coordinated chessboard, should distinguish all production tasks by importance and urgency, place mining equipment in the primary position, and ensure priority completion. For the production of some major products of mining equipment, the production progress of each enterprise should be arranged; the enterprise should arrange the production sequence of each workshop and the delivery progress according to product items, and provide guarantees in the arrangement of labor, materials, and supporting products. Only by taking such practical and specific measures can we ensure that mining equipment is completed on time, in quantity, and with quality, and delivered ahead of schedule.

To ensure that mining equipment is delivered on time and ahead of schedule, each set of equipment must have a dedicated factory and a dedicated person responsible. Last year, each set of rolling mills had a dedicated factory and a dedicated person responsible, and they were completed within a limited time, so the effect was very good. This year, the production of mining equipment should be grasped more tightly, deeply, and meticulously. In particular, key products such as small locomotives, small mine cars, mining equipment, washing and sorting equipment, and loading and transporting equipment in mining areas must be personally grasped by leading cadres at all levels. A production schedule should be drawn up in accordance with the national plan, and special personnel should be responsible for inspecting production on a ten-day basis according to the schedule and the product requirements to ensure that the tasks are completed within the specified time limit. Not only should we grasp the progress, but also the quality and supporting facilities. The production of general equipment such as drainage and ventilation required by mines should also be grasped tightly. Without these devices, the mine cannot operate normally.

Another important link to ensure the timely and early completion of mining equipment is to apply technical innovation results to production in a timely manner. This year's technical innovation in the manufacture of mining equipment has achieved remarkable results. After some products have been reformed, the weight and processing man-hours have been reduced by about 30%, and the efficiency has been greatly improved. Widely adopting and manufacturing this improved, simple, and high-efficiency mining equipment, promoting the technical innovation experience in a complete set, and continuing to mobilize the masses to further carry out technical revolution targeting the weak links in production can greatly speed up the production progress. In this regard, manufacturing departments, design departments, and user departments should cooperate closely. Manufacturing departments and design departments should apply the technical innovation achievements of the user departments to production as soon as possible.

With the continuous leap forward in mine production, a large number of transportation equipment, mining equipment, and washing and sorting equipment in mines urgently need to be supplemented with accessories and undergo daily maintenance, which is also a very important task. Only by doing this work well can we ensure that existing mining equipment fully exerts its production potential. Therefore, all localities should vigorously organize the production of accessories and strengthen mine maintenance work. At present, many local machinery factories, under the unified leadership of the higher-level party committees, have adopted the method of linking factories and mines to assist the mines in repairing and equipping existing machinery and equipment, which is also a feasible method.

At present, the mining industry's demand for mining equipment is very urgent. Relevant leading organs and enterprises must seize the opportunity, continue to strengthen leadership, adhere to going deep into reality and the forefront of production, rely on the masses, fully mobilize and utilize all aspects of strength, launch a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, and strive to deliver more and better excavators, power equipment, washing and sorting equipment, and transportation tools to the mines in the shortest possible time!

### 赶制矿山设备

    赶制矿山设备
    赶制矿山设备，加速采掘工业的技术改造，这是机械工业部门职工在当前的增产节约运动中担负的一项重要任务。
    钢铁增产，煤炭和矿石必须先行。大力对现有的矿山进行技术改造，逐步用先进的生产工具代替手工劳动，提高生产过程的机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的水平，乃是最迅速最有效的增加煤炭和矿石产量的方法。我国一般矿山的机械化水平原来都比较低。在小型矿山中，笨重体力劳动所占的比重还要大一些。在这种情况下，用机械来武装矿山，就可以在不增加人力、甚至减少人力的条件下达到增产的目的。例如，一台三立方米的挖掘机，每班就可以代替七百五十个人的工作，每天就可以节省两千多个劳动力。例如，三辆牵引机车，就可以代替约一万人用人力挑运。由此可见，尽多尽快地为矿山赶制机械设备，对于提高矿山生产效率，节约劳动力，有着多么巨大的作用。
    为了优先发展采掘工业，今年矿山设备的生产有很大的发展。许多地区的机械制造部门在大力支援农业的同时，开展了支援采掘工业、赶制矿山设备的群众运动。但是，矿山设备的生产，仍然赶不上需要。特别是增产节约运动开展以后，钢铁工业对煤炭、矿石的需要量必将进一步增长，这就要求机械工业部门必须尽快地供应更多更好的矿山设备。现在第三季度已经过去一半多，大量的设备要在剩下的四个多月里完成。因此，担负这项任务的各个企业，需要立即组织全体职工讨论增产节约计划，订出按月按旬按日生产矿山设备的进度指标，和力争超额完成这些指标的具体措施。
    赶制矿山设备的各项措施中一个重要的措施是，各个有关的部门、地区和企业，要根据全国一盘棋的精神，将全部生产任务分别轻重缓急，把矿山设备排在首要地位，保证优先完成。对矿山设备中一些重大产品的生产，要排出每个企业的生产进度；企业要按产品项目排出每个车间的生产次序以及交货进度，并在劳动力、材料、配套产品的安排上给以保证。只有采取这种切实、具体的措施，才能保证矿山设备按时、按量、按质完成和提前交货。
    要保证矿山设备按时和提前交货，就必须做到每套设备都有专厂、专人负责。去年生产轧钢机，每一套都有专厂、专人负责，并且限期完成，因而效果很好。今年矿山设备的生产应当抓得更紧、更深、更细。特别是其中的重点产品，如小机车、小矿车、采掘设备、洗选设备、矿区装运设备等，各级有关的领导干部必须亲自抓。要根据国家计划排出生产进度表，专人专责按进度表按产品的要求逐旬地检查生产，保证在规定的期限内完成任务。不但要抓进度，而且要抓质量和配套。矿山所需要的排水、通风等通用设备的生产，也要抓紧。因为没有这些设备，矿山就无法正常进行生产。
    保证矿山设备按时和提前完成的另一个重要环节是，要及时地将技术革新成果运用到生产中去。今年制造矿山设备的技术革新已经取得了显著的成绩，有些产品经过改革以后，重量和加工工时减少了30％左右，效能大大提高。广泛采用和制造这种改进后的、简易的、高效率的矿山设备，将技术革新经验配套推广，并且继续发动群众，针对生产中的薄弱环节，进一步开展技术革命，就可以大大加快生产进度。在这方面，制造部门、设计部门与使用部门要通力合作，紧密结合。制造部门和设计部门要尽快地把使用部门的技术革新成果运用到生产中去。
    随着矿山生产的持续跃进，矿山中大量的运输设备、采掘设备、洗选设备都急需补充配件和进行日常的维修，这也是一项十分重要的工作。只有把这件工作做好了，才能保证现有矿山设备充分地发挥生产潜力。因此，各地要大力组织配件的生产，并加强矿山的维修工作。目前不少地方的机械工厂在上级党委统一领导下采取厂矿挂钩的办法，协助矿山修配现有的机器设备，也是一种可行的方法。
    现在，采掘工业部门对矿山设备的需求非常迫切。有关的领导机关和企业要抓紧时机，继续加强领导，坚持深入实际、深入生产第一线，依靠群众，充分动员和运用各方面的力量，开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，力争在最短的时间内，把又多又好的挖掘机、动力设备、洗选设备和运输工具送到矿山去！
