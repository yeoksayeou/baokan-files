The people of North Vietnam, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, are intensifying the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, and are actively developing industrial and agricultural production to improve the material and cultural living standards of the people. In 1959, the output value of agricultural production increased by 52.6% compared to 1955, and the average output per capita reached 352 kilograms, ranking first in Southeast Asia. North Vietnam has not only solved the perennial grain shortage that existed during the French colonial period but also has hundreds of thousands of tons of surplus grain for export. The total output value of industry and handicrafts has increased by 310% compared to 1955, with industry increasing sevenfold and state-owned industry increasing sixteenfold. In 1954, there were only nineteen enterprises in the entire North Vietnam; currently, the number of large and medium-sized enterprises has increased to one hundred and fifty-two. A total of seventy-two enterprises above the quota are under construction in 1960. In addition, there are more than five hundred local industrial enterprises. Over the past five years, a factory, hospital, school, or residence has been built every seven days. Due to the development of production, the living standards of the working people have been significantly improved. The employment problem of hundreds of thousands of unemployed people left behind by the French colonialists has been basically solved. North Vietnam has basically eliminated illiteracy. Currently, the number of primary and secondary school students accounts for 16% of the total population of North Vietnam, which is five times more than the number of primary and secondary school students in the entire Indochina during the peak period of student enrollment under French colonial rule in 1939. There are now eight universities with 8,240 university students, which is thirteen times more than the total number of university students in the entire Indochina in 1939; the number of students in secondary specialized schools has increased forty-onefold.

    越南北方欣欣向荣
    越南北方人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席领导下，正在加紧进行对农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造，并积极发展工农业生产，提高人民的物质文化生活水平。1959年，农业生产的产值已比1955年增加了52.6％，按人口平均计算产量达到三百五十二公斤，跃居东南亚首位。越南北方不仅已经解决了过去法国殖民主义统治时期常年缺粮的现象，而且还有几十万吨余粮出口。工业和手工业总产值已比1955年增加了310％，工业增加了七倍，国营工业增加十六倍。1954年，全越南北方只有十九个企业，目前大、中型企业已增加到一百五十二个。1960年正在建设的限额以上的企业共七十二个。此外，地方工业企业已有五百多个。五年来，每七天就建成一座工厂或医院、学校、住宅。由于生产的发展，劳动人民的生活水平已经有了显著提高。十几万由法国殖民主义者遗留下来的失业者的就业问题已经基本上解决。越南北方基本上扫清了文盲。目前，中小学生人数已占越南北方总人口的16％，比法国殖民主义者统治时学生人数最高的1939年全印度支那的中小学生人数增加了五倍。大学已有八所，拥有八千二百四十名大学生，比1939年全印度支那的大学生总数增加了十三倍；中等专业学校的学生增加了四十一倍。（附图片）
