Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, August 24th: Algerian Republic Provisional Government Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Krim Belkacem issued a statement at a press conference held in Châteaudun on the 23rd, suggesting that a summit meeting of Arab countries be convened to discuss the Algerian issue. He demanded that Arab countries implement economic and political boycotts against France, including severing diplomatic relations.

The news said that Belkacem also requested that Arab and non-Arab countries send volunteer troops to aid the Algerian people. He pointed out that France is using the Foreign Legion to wage the Algerian war.

Belkacem demanded that the Arab League countries take united action to deal with countries aiding France in the Algerian war; at the same time, he demanded that the Arab League countries take action to ensure the withdrawal of all French troops and NATO troops from Algeria and other Arab countries.

The news said that Belkacem also demanded a plebiscite be held in Algeria organized and supervised by the United Nations.

According to reports from Tunis: The Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, in a communique issued on the 23rd, advocated a plebiscite in Algeria organized and supervised by the United Nations. The communique stated, "The Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic notes that General de Gaulle refuses to negotiate the conditions and guarantees for freely consulting the Algerian people's opinion. French policy has stripped self-determination of all democratic content, attempting to forcibly impose, by force, a set of regulations leading to the Balkanization of Algeria." The communique stated that, in this situation, the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic believes that the matter of consulting the Algerian people's opinion must be implemented through a plebiscite organized and supervised by the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: The Algerian National Liberation Front's organ "El Moudjahid" weekly recently published an editorial stating, "The most important method of strengthening our struggle is certainly to vigorously strengthen our military forces, because this is the only language the French colonialists understand, and it is the most important way to thoroughly eradicate international colonialism from our African continent's fortress." The editorial pointed out that the Algerian government hopes to adopt a rapid and peaceful solution to stop the bloodshed between the two sides in Algeria, and to prove to the world that it is prepared to negotiate on the basis of realizing the Algerian people's right to self-determination and on the basis of implementing this principle in a healthy and sincere manner.

The editorial said that the French government's blind obstinacy and madness leave the Algerian people with only one possibility for achieving their goal, which is to strengthen the national struggle in all aspects in order to force the enemy to recognize the rights of the Algerian people.

    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理发表声明
    呼吁阿拉伯国家大力支援阿尔及利亚
    并要求在阿尔及利亚举行由联合国组织和监督的公民选举
    “圣战者报”指出要加强军事力量肃清殖民主义
    新华社24日讯　贝鲁特消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府副总理兼外交部长克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆23日在什陶拉举行的记者招待会上发表声明，建议召开阿拉伯国家最高级会议来讨论阿尔及利亚问题。他要求阿拉伯国家对法国实行经济和政治抵制，包括断绝外交关系。
    消息说，贝勒卡塞姆还要求阿拉伯国家和非阿拉伯国家派遣志愿军援助阿尔及利亚人民。他指出，法国正在用外籍军团进行阿尔及利亚战争。
    贝勒卡塞姆要求阿拉伯联盟国家采取一致行动，来对付在阿尔及利亚战争中援助法国的国家；同时要求阿拉伯联盟国家采取行动，保证所有的法国军队和北大西洋公约组织的军队从阿尔及利亚以及其他阿拉伯国家撤走。
    消息说，贝勒卡塞姆还要求在阿尔及利亚举行由联合国组织和监督的公民投票。
    据突尼斯消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府在23日发表的一项公报中，主张在阿尔及利亚举行由联合国组织和监督的公民投票。公报说，“阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府注意到戴高乐将军拒绝谈判自由征询阿尔及利亚人民意见的条件和保证。法国的政策抽去了自决的全部民主内容，图谋以武力强使人接受一种导致阿尔及利亚巴尔干化的法规”。公报说，在这种情况下，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府认为征询阿尔及利亚人民意见一事，必须通过由联合国组织和监督的公民投票来实行。
    新华社24日讯　阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线机关报“圣战者报”周刊最近一期发表社论说，“加强我们斗争的最重要的方法，肯定是大力加强我们的军事力量，因为这是法国殖民主义者所了解的唯一语言，是彻底肃清国际殖民主义在我们非洲大陆的最重要的堡垒的途径。”社论指出，阿尔及利亚政府希望采取迅速和和平的解决办法来停止双方在阿尔及利亚的流血，并向全世界证明它准备在实现阿尔及利亚人民自决的原则下以及在健康和诚意地执行这个原则的基础上进行谈判的决心。
    社论说，但是法国政府的盲目顽固和疯狂使阿尔及利亚人民只有一种达到目标的可能性，即在一切方面加强民族的斗争，以便迫使敌人承认阿尔及利亚人民的权利。
