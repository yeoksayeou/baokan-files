Striving for First Place

    The broad masses of workers in Tianjin have launched a vigorous mass movement to strive for first place. They are not only learning from advanced experiences and catching up with advanced indicators, but also surpassing existing advanced indicators and creating even more advanced ones. This movement is excellent, fully expressing the lofty aspirations of the Chinese working class. Striving for first place means striving for progress. On our industrial front, if everyone strives for progress, everywhere strives for progress, all the time strives for progress, and in everything strives for progress, we can forever maintain the high speed of the Great Leap Forward.

    In our country, striving for first place is not about showing off, winning awards, or obtaining personal honors; it is first and foremost a major event of collectivism and revolutionary heroism. Those who are catching up with the advanced have abundant ready-made experiences to learn from, as well as the selfless care and assistance of comrades; those who create advanced indicators can also enrich the collective treasure trove with their new experiences, adding technological treasures to accelerate the construction of socialism. In this way, with everyone united and working together, we can enable our country to catch up with or surpass advanced capitalist countries earlier and faster, and rapidly build our country into a powerful socialist nation.

    争第一
    天津市广大职工开展了轰轰烈烈的争第一的群众运动。他们不仅学习先进经验，赶上先进的指标，而且要超过现有的先进指标，创造更先进的指标。这个运动好得很，充分表达了中国工人阶级的雄心壮志。争第一就是争上游。我们工业战线上，人人争上游，处处争上游，时时争上游，事事争上游，就能够永远保持大跃进的高速度。
    在我们的国家里，争第一不是什么出风头、夺锦标、获取个人荣誉的事，它首先是集体主义、革命英雄主义的革命志气的大事。对于赶先进的人，既有丰富的现成经验可以学习，又有同志们无私的关怀和帮助；创造先进指标的人，也可以把自己的新经验去丰富集体的宝库，为加速建设社会主义增加技术珍宝。这样，大家一条心，一股劲，就能够使我们国家更早地、更快地赶上或超过先进的资本主义国家，迅速把我国建成一个强大的社会主义国家。
