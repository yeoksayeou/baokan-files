Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In the six years after the signing of the Geneva Accords, U.S. imperialism, while unscrupulously expanding its military preparations in South Vietnam, has carried out a cruel plunder of the South Vietnamese economy, turning the land of South Vietnam, rich in land and resources, into a desolate scene, and the people's lives are extremely impoverished.

"U.S. Aid" is the main form of U.S. economic plunder of South Vietnam, and its purpose is to urge the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to step up its military expansion and war preparations. In the past six years, the United States has given South Vietnam nearly two billion U.S. dollars in "aid," of which, in addition to more than 424 million yuan for weapons, 80% is surplus U.S. materials.

The surplus materials that the United States dumped into South Vietnam, like straws, cruelly sucked the blood and sweat of the South Vietnamese people and seriously devastated South Vietnam's national economy. South Vietnam was originally a place rich in agricultural products, but American agricultural products such as meat, fish, shrimp, eggs, various vegetables, fruits, and rice noodles have flooded the market.

Under Ngo Dinh Diem's traitorous policy of "encouraging foreign capital investment," the United States is also stepping up the continuous import of its monopoly capital into South Vietnam in order to further plunder South Vietnam's economy. At the beginning of this year, the U.S. "Development Loan Fund" allocated 7.9 million U.S. dollars to invest in the "construction" of South Vietnamese railways and negotiated with the South Vietnamese authorities on the construction of a power station. The "U.S. Economic Aid Mission to South Vietnam" also announced in April this year that the United States would lend money to South Vietnam to establish a weaving factory. Recently, the American "Triangle Corporation" and "Hanshan International Corporation" also decided to form the "Vietnam-America Textile Company" with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to build textile factories in Saigon, Bien Hoa, Da Nang and other places. At the same time, under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique adopted many restrictions on national industries in order to further open the door for U.S. monopoly capital to plunder. For example, Ngo Dinh Diem's order to ban the production of handicraft textile industry is an ironclad proof that it facilitates the dumping of American cloth.

In order to realize the policy of turning South Vietnam into a U.S. colony and make the South Vietnamese economy completely dependent on U.S. monopoly capital, U.S. imperialism has instructed the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in recent years to reduce rice production in South Vietnam and develop cash crops to provide the United States with necessary strategic materials. Obeying the wishes of the American masters, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique dispatched a large number of military police secret agents to force the people to abandon rice production, leave their homes and go to the mountains to "reclaim wasteland" and plant cash crops.

The U.S. imperialist plunder of the South Vietnamese economy and the military expansion and war preparations of the U.S.-Ngo clique have brought profound disasters to the South Vietnamese people. Taking grain production as an example, in recent years, South Vietnam's rice production has dropped sharply. In 1958-1959, only 3.2 million tons were harvested, which was the lowest level of rice production in South Vietnam in the past decade.

U.S. imperialist dumping of goods has dealt a fatal blow to South Vietnam's national economy. Taking the sugar industry as an example, due to the large-scale dumping of American cloth and American sugar, the South Vietnamese sugar industry went bankrupt, and the vast number of sugar cane farmers in South Vietnam were plunged into desperation. The local sugar industry, which could fully meet the needs of South Vietnam, has been squeezed out by more than three-quarters by imported American sugar. The situation in the textile industry is also similar. Factories closed down one after another, the countryside went bankrupt, and the number of unemployed people increased day by day. In Saigon alone, 68.6% of the city's labor force often cannot find jobs.

    美资本吮吸越南南方人民血汗
    剩余商品和资本大量输入越南南方进行残酷掠夺  越南南方民族工业凋敝　稻米减产　民生困苦不堪
    据新华社讯　美帝国主义在日内瓦协议签订后的六年中，在南越肆无忌惮地扩军备战的同时，对南越的经济进行了残酷的掠夺，使土地富饶、资源丰富的南越，变得一片凄凉，人民生活贫困不堪。
    “美援”是美国对南越经济掠夺的主要形式，其目的是促使吴庭艳集团加紧扩军备战。六年来，美国给予南越近二十亿美元的“援助”，其中除四亿二千四百余万元是武器外，80％是美国的剩余物资。
    美国向南越倾销的剩余物资，像一根根吸血管一样，残酷地吮吸南越人民的血汗，严重地摧残南越的民族经济。南越本来是一个盛产农产品的地方，但是美国的肉类、鱼、虾、蛋、各种菜蔬、水果、米粉等农产品，却泛滥市场。
    在吴庭艳的“鼓励外国资本投资”的卖国政策下，美国还正在加紧把它的垄断资本源源不断地输入南越，以便进一步掠夺南越的经济。今年年初，美国“开发贷款基金会”就曾拨出七百九十万美元投资“建设”南越铁路，并同南越当局就修建一所电站进行谈判。“美国驻南越经济援助团”今年4月还宣布了美国将贷款给南越建立一所织造厂。最近，美国的三角公司”、“翰山国际公司”还决定与吴庭艳集团组成“越美纺织公司”，在西贡、边和、岘港等地建立纺织厂。与此同时，吴庭艳集团在美帝国主义的指使下，却对民族工业采取了许多限制，以便为美国垄断资本进一步打开掠夺的方便之门。例如吴庭艳曾下令禁止手工纺织业的生产，就是便于美国布匹倾销的一个铁证。
    为了实现变南越为美国殖民地的政策，使南越经济完全依附于美国垄断资本，美帝国主义近年来指令吴庭艳集团缩小南越的水稻生产，发展经济作物，为美国提供必要的战略物资。秉承美国主子的意旨，吴庭艳集团出动了大批军警特务，逼迫人民废弃稻米生产，背井离乡到山区“垦荒”，种植经济作物。
    美帝国主义对南越经济的掠夺和美吴集团扩军备战的结果，给南越人民带来深重的灾难。以粮食生产为例，近年来南越稻米急剧减产，1958—1959年只收三百二十万吨，为南越十年来稻谷生产最低水平。
    美帝国主义的商品倾销使南越民族经济遭到致命的打击。以制糖业为例，由于美国布和美国糖的大量倾销，南越蔗糖业破产，并且使南越广大蔗农陷于绝境。原来完全可以满足南越需要的本地蔗糖业已经被美国进口糖挤垮了四分之三以上。纺织业情况也是如此。工厂纷纷倒闭，农村破产，失业人口与日俱增。仅西贡市经常找不到职业的就占全市劳动力的68.6％。
