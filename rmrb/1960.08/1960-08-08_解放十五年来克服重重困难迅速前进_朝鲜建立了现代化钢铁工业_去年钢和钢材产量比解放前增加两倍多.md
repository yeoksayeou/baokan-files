Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th - This reporter reports: In the fifteen years since liberation, the people of northern Korea have overcome numerous difficulties and established a modern steel industry. In 1959, compared with 1944 before liberation, iron production increased by 44%, while steel and steel materials both increased more than twofold. After completing this year's steel production plan, northern Korea's pig iron production will reach 850,000 tons, averaging 85 kilograms per person.

This achievement was hard-won. Korea's steel industry suffered severe damage from Japanese imperialism during liberation. They deliberately cooled molten iron and steel inside the furnaces, destroying the equipment. Not long after the newly reborn Korean people overcame numerous difficulties to bring the steel factories back into normal production, American imperialism launched the Korean War, bombing the steel factories in northern Korea. However, the indomitable Korean workers, in the short seven years after the war, rebuilt steel bases on the ruins, restoring, expanding, and constructing many blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and new converter workshops, rolling workshops, etc. Because they were rebuilt with modern, new-style technology and equipment, the production capacity of these steel production facilities has greatly increased. Huanghai Iron and Steel Works' No. 1 blast furnace, restored entirely with Korean-made equipment, currently has an average daily output of 750 tons, equal to the total output of the plant's three blast furnaces before liberation. The plant's open-hearth furnaces, which previously produced 50 tons of steel per batch, have now been expanded to produce 100 tons per batch, and the electric furnaces, which previously produced 15 tons of steel per batch, can now produce 30 tons per batch. As a result, in 1959, the plant produced 694,000 tons of iron, 451,000 tons of steel, and 331,000 tons of steel materials. This year, the steel and steel material produced in the first half of the year alone is more than twice the total steel and steel material production in 1944.

Korea's steel industry has not only been rebuilt, but it has also overcome the colonial nature inherited from history. During the Japanese rule, less than one-third of the pig iron produced in northern Korea was refined into steel in Korea, and only about one-fifth could be rolled into steel materials in Korea, and the variety of steel materials produced was very limited. Most of the pig iron was transported to Japan for processing. Now, all the iron produced in northern Korea, except for a portion used for cast iron, can be refined into steel and rolled into more than 1,100 kinds of steel materials of various specifications, including heavy steel materials for manufacturing cars and tractors and various special steel materials.

The rapid development of Korea's steel industry is due to the Korean Workers' Party's adherence to the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry while simultaneously developing light industry and agriculture after the war. In particular, after Premier Kim Il-sung proposed in 1958 the planning target of reaching four million tons of pig iron and three million to three and a half million tons of steel in six to seven years, and then proposed the slogan "Steel and machinery are the kings of industry," it further encouraged the Korean people and the working class to work hard to develop steel production. In the winter of 1958 alone, more than 12,000 young people poured into the steel front, and students from various places also participated in the labor of building steel factories. As a result, last year alone, two blast furnaces with an annual output of 700,000 tons, a rolling workshop with an annual output of 200,000 tons, as well as converter workshops, open-hearth furnaces, and electric furnaces were restored and newly built. Steel workers in various factories also launched competitions to increase steel production. Workers at the Huanghai Iron and Steel Works proposed the slogan: "Increase steel production like the battle of 1211 Heights (i.e., the highlands that the American aggressors called 'Heartbreak Ridge')." They worked hard in production and studied technology like charging into battle. The steelmaking workshop of this factory had a maximum annual output of 120,000 tons before liberation, but this year, the steelmaking workers will produce 320,000 tons of steel.

    解放十五年来克服重重困难迅速前进
    朝鲜建立了现代化钢铁工业
    去年钢和钢材产量比解放前增加两倍多
    新华社平壤6日电　本社记者报道：朝鲜北部人民在解放后十五年来，克服重重困难，建立了一个现代化的钢铁工业。1959年同解放前1944年相比，铁的产量增长了44％，钢和钢材都增加了两倍多。在完成今年的钢铁生产计划后，朝鲜北部的生铁产量将达到八十五万吨，按人口平均每人就可达到八十五公斤。
    这个成绩的得来是十分不容易的。朝鲜的钢铁工业在解放时曾受到日本帝国主义的严重破坏。它故意把铁水和钢水冷却在炉内，毁坏了设备。在获得新生的朝鲜人民克服了重重困难使各个钢铁工厂正常地生产以后不久，美帝国主义又发动了侵朝战争，对朝鲜北部的各个钢铁厂狂轰滥炸。但是不屈的朝鲜工人，在战后短短的七年内，又在废墟上重建起了一座座的钢铁基地，恢复、扩建和新建了许多高炉、平炉以及新的转炉车间、轧钢车间等。由于是用现代化的新式技术设备重建起来的，这些钢铁生产设备的生产能力都大大提高了。完全用朝鲜自己制造的设备恢复起来的黄海制铁所一号高炉，目前平均日产量达到七百五十吨，等于解放前这个厂的三座高炉的总产量。这个厂过去每次出钢五十吨的平炉现在也扩建成为每次出钢一百吨的了，过去一次出钢十五吨的电炉现在一次能出钢三十吨。这样，这个厂1959年就生产了六十九万四千吨铁、四十五万一千吨钢、三十三万一千吨钢材。今年仅上半年生产的钢和钢材就达到1944年全年钢和钢材产量的两倍以上。
    朝鲜的钢铁工业不仅是重建起来了，而且克服了历史上遗留下来的殖民地性质。在日本统治时期，朝鲜北部生产的生铁只有不到三分之一在朝鲜炼成钢，只有约五分之一能在朝鲜轧制成钢材，而且生产的钢材的品种很少。大部分生铁都运到日本去进行加工。现在，朝鲜北部生产的铁除了一部分用于铸铁以外，全部可炼成钢，并能轧成一千一百多种各种规格的钢材，其中包括制造汽车和拖拉机用的重型钢材和各种特殊钢材。
    朝鲜钢铁工业的迅速发展，是由于朝鲜劳动党在战后坚持了优先发展重工业同时发展轻工业和农业的政策。特别是金日成首相在1958年提出了在六七年内使生铁产量达到四百万吨、钢产量达到三百万到三百五十万吨的规划指标，并接着提出了“钢铁和机械是工业之王”的口号以后，更加鼓舞着朝鲜人民和工人阶级为了发展钢铁生产而努力奋战。1958年冬就有一万二千多名青年涌入了钢铁战线，各地的学生也参加了建设钢铁厂的劳动。结果，仅在去年就有年产七十万吨的两座高炉和一座年产二十万吨的轧钢车间以及转炉车间、平炉、电炉恢复和新建起来了。各厂的钢铁工人也为增产钢铁展开竞赛，黄海制铁所的工人提出了：“像1211高地（即美国侵略者称为‘伤心岭’的高地）战斗一样增产钢铁”的口号，他们像在战场上冲锋陷阵一样努力生产、钻研技术。这个厂的炼钢车间在解放前最高年产量是十二万吨，可是今年炼钢工人要生产三十二万吨钢。
