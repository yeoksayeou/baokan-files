    Promote Rapid Transportation with High Yield, and Promote High Yield with Rapid Transportation
    Jingxing Mining Bureau Conscientiously Transforms Transportation System and Strengthens Road-Mine Cooperation, Coal Production Rises Steadily
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 27th: The transportation within the Jingxing Mining Bureau in Hebei is well-managed, achieving the goal of promoting rapid transportation with high yield, and promoting high yield with rapid transportation. From January to July this year, the entire mining bureau overfulfilled its raw coal production plan every month, and all the coal produced was transported out in a timely manner; among them, the amount of coking coal transported to key steel plants such as Wuhan Iron and Steel (Wugang) and Baotou Iron and Steel (Baogang), and iron and steel enterprises in the Shijiazhuang area, increased by more than 63% compared with the same period last year. Since the beginning of August, the coal production and transportation volume of this bureau has further increased compared to the end of July. This is the result of the Jingxing Mining District Party Committee, under the guidance of the thought of "taking steel as the key and coal as the forerunner," continuously overcoming and resolving the weak links in ground and underground transportation in the mining area, and vigorously strengthening road-mine cooperation while greatly grasping high coal production.
    Jingxing Coal Mine is one of the major coking coal production areas in the country. In recent years, driven by the rapid development of steel production, the output of raw coal in this mine has increased dramatically. Taking 1958 as 100, it increased to 157.99 in 1959; in the first half of this year, the average daily output increased by 28.8% compared with the same period last year. However, initially, because the transportation work did not keep up, a large amount of raw coal could not be transported out in time every day, which caused some difficulties for underground production. In response to this situation, the Mining District Party Committee believed that in order to successfully complete the task of increasing coal production to support steel, it is necessary not only to achieve a substantial increase in production, but also to ensure the sustained leap forward of transportation work. Therefore, on the one hand, they mobilized the masses to rush to transport the stored coal, and on the other hand, according to the weak links in the transportation work, they adopted the method of breaking through link by link and carried out a comprehensive technical transformation of the transportation above and below ground. For example, at the beginning of the year, the bureau first crash-built five native-foreign combined chute coal bunkers due to the lack of loading equipment, which caused a large amount of coal to be stockpiled. This rapidly increased the amount of mechanized loading from about 60% to 83%, basically eliminating the phenomenon of manual loading after the raw coal fell to the ground. Subsequently, hoisting and underground transportation became weak links, and the transportation capacity was not commensurate with the needs of increased production. The bureau then mobilized the masses to engage in technical innovation to improve the mining transportation capacity. Jingxing No. 2 Mine generally promoted the advanced experience of safe and fast hoisting among winch drivers, and also made some reforms to the main roadway transportation, which increased the hoisting and transportation speed by about a quarter. Workers in Mines No. 1 and No. 3 carried out a series of reforms in response to the low efficiency of manual can loading, which affected the hoisting speed of the cages and the turnover speed of the mine cars. Since April, the amount of coal transported from underground by these two mines every day has increased by about 20% compared with the first quarter.
    After the transportation capacity was improved, in order to give full play to the efficiency of each line, the bureau also promoted "four eight" cross-operation in all mining faces to achieve balanced production and balanced transportation. In this way, each mine in the bureau can transport a large amount of coal at all times on the transportation line from the mining area, the main roadway transportation, the shaft hoisting, all the way to loading on the train, completely eliminating the past frequent interruptions or blockages. Therefore, the coal transportation volume of the whole mine has been increasing day by day, and the average daily amount of coal transported from the whole bureau has increased by more than a quarter compared with January and February to June and July. Mine production has also increased by about 12%.
    While transforming the transportation system, the cooperation between the Jingxing Mining Bureau and the railway transportation department has also been greatly strengthened compared with the past. They jointly established a one-stop transportation command with the Xinjing Railway Station in the mining area, and jointly took charge of organizing the train formation, the allocation of loading and unloading labor, and other work. At the same time, on the basis of learning from the Fuxin City road-mine cooperation "twelve unifications" experience, they further implemented the unification of locomotives, the unification of technical indicators, as well as the unification of line equipment, freight yards, loading and unloading labor, and the use of machinery, so that all aspects of railway departments and coal mine transportation are all unified, forming a consistent whole.

    以高产促快运  以快运促高产
    井陉矿务局认真改造运输系统加强路矿协作煤炭生产节节上升
    新华社天津27日电　河北井陉矿务局矿内运输抓得好，做到了以高产促快运，又以快运促高产。今年1月至7月，全矿务局月月都超额完成了原煤生产计划，所产的煤炭也都及时地运出；其中只是运往武钢、包钢等重点钢厂和石家庄地区钢铁企业的焦煤，就比去年同期增多了63％以上。8月初以来，这个局的煤炭生产和运输量，比7月底又有提高。这是井陉矿区党委在“以钢为纲，煤炭先行”的思想指导下，在大抓煤炭高产的同时，不断克服和解决矿区地面运输和井下运输的薄弱环节，大力加强路矿协作的结果。
    井陉煤矿是全国主要炼焦煤产地之一。几年来，在钢铁生产飞跃发展的带动下，这个矿原煤产量突飞猛涨，以1958年为100，1959年提高到157.99；今年上半年，平均日产量又比去年同期增长了28.8％。但是开始因为运输工作没有跟上，每天都有大量原煤不能及时运出，给井下生产造成一些困难。针对这种情况，矿区党委认为要出色地完成增产煤炭支援钢铁的任务，不仅要实现大幅度增产，还必须保证运输工作的持续跃进。因此，他们一面发动群众突击抢运存煤，一面又根据运输工作中出现的薄弱环节，采用环环突破的办法，对井上井下的运输进行了全面的技术改造。如在年初时，主要是由于装车设备不足，造成大量煤炭积压，这个局便首先突击修建了五座土洋结合的滑坡煤仓，使机械化装车量从原来的60％左右迅速提高到83％，基本上消灭了原煤落地以后再用人工装车的现象。接着，提升和井下运输又成为薄弱环节，运输能力同增产需要不相称。这个局又发动群众大闹技术革新，提高矿内运输能力。井陉二矿在绞车司机中普遍推广了安全快速提升的先进经验，又对大巷运输作了一些改革，使提升和运输速度提高了四分之一左右。一、三两矿的工人又针对人工装罐效率低影响罐笼提升和矿车周转速度的情况，进行了一系列的改革。4月份以来，这两个矿每天从井下运出的煤，都比第一季度增长了20％左右。
    在运输能力提高以后，为了充分发挥各条线路的效能，这个局又在所有采掘工作面推广了“四八”交叉作业，作到均衡生产，均衡运输。这样，全局各矿在从采区、大巷运输、井筒提升，一直到装上火车的运输线上，时刻都可运送着大量的煤炭，彻底消除了过去经常发生的中断或堵塞现象。因此，全矿煤炭运输量日日提高，以6、7两月同1、2月份比，全局平均每天运出的煤炭增加了四分之一以上。矿井产量也提高了12％左右。
    在改造运输系统的同时，井陉矿务局同铁路运输部门的协作也比过去大大加强。他们跟矿区的新井车站共同成立了一条龙运输指挥部，共同负责组织车辆成龙、装卸劳力调配等工作。与此同时，他们还在学习阜新市路矿协作“十二统一”经验的基础上，进一步实行了机车统一，技术指标统一，以及线路设备、货场、装卸劳力、机具使用等的统一，使铁路部门和煤矿运输的各个方面全都统一起来，形成了步调一致的整体。
