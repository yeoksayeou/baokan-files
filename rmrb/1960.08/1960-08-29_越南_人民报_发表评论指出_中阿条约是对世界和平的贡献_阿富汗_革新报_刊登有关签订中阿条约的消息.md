Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 28th. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today warmly welcoming the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Afghanistan.

The commentary, titled "A Concrete Contribution to Strengthening the Solidarity of Asian and African Countries," stated, "The Vietnamese people and the peace-loving people of Asia, Africa, and the world are very pleased with the fruitful results achieved by Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, during his visit to the Kingdom of Afghanistan."

The commentary stated, "China and Afghanistan, two neighboring countries in Asia, have long enjoyed friendly relations. The signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between China and Afghanistan is not only beneficial to the people of both countries and to the further strengthening of the inherent friendly relations between the two countries, but also has extremely important significance for the current situation in Asia."

The commentary pointed out, "Imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs have been and are deliberately undermining the solidarity between the peoples of Asian countries, especially the solidarity between some Asian countries and the People's Republic of China, in order to 'fish in troubled waters' and realize their schemes of aggression and war. Obviously, the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between China and Afghanistan is a positive contribution to the cause of consolidating the solidarity and friendship between Asian and African countries and defending peace in Asia and the world."

The commentary emphasized that the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between China and Afghanistan "shatters the propaganda rhetoric of the U.S. imperialist bloc that slanders and distorts the consistent policy of peace and friendship of the People's Republic of China, and thoroughly exposes their deceptive face."

The commentary pointed out that following the signing of the Treaties of Friendship and Non-Aggression and agreements on border issues between China and Burma, and China and Nepal, the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between China and Afghanistan is a new victory for the principles of peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation that no reactionary force can undermine.

The commentary stated, "The Vietnamese people warmly welcome the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between China and Afghanistan, and believe that this event will help to further develop and consolidate the solidarity between Asian and African countries, which is a powerful factor determining all victories of the Asian and African peoples in their struggle against imperialism and in defense of national independence and world peace."

Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, August 27th. The Afghan newspaper "Islah" today published news of the signing ceremony of the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Afghanistan, as well as the Agreement on the Exchange of Goods and Payments between the Governments of the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Afghanistan.

"Islah" also published three photos: the signing ceremony of the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Afghanistan; the signing ceremony of the Agreement on the Exchange of Goods and Payments between the two sides; and a group photo of Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, with Sardar Mohammed Daoud, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, and Sardar Mohammed Naim, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.

    评论指出，“以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义及其走狗，曾经并正在蓄意破坏亚洲各国人民之间的团结，特别是亚洲一些国家同中华人民共和国之间的团结，以期‘混水摸鱼’和实现它们的侵略和战争阴谋。很显然，中国和阿富汗友好和互不侵犯条约的签订，是巩固亚非各国之间的团结和友谊，保卫亚洲和世界和平的事业的一个积极贡献。”

    评论指出，随着中国同缅甸、中国同尼泊尔签订的友好和互不侵犯条约和关于边界问题的协定以后，中国和阿富汗又签订了友好和互不侵犯条约，这是任何反动势力都不能破坏的和平共处和友好合作的原则的一个新胜利。
    评论表示，“越南人民热烈欢迎中国同阿富汗友好和互不侵犯条约的签订，并且相信，这个事件将有助于进一步发展和巩固亚非各国之间的团结，这种团结是决定亚非人民反对帝国主义，保卫民族独立和世界和平事业的一切胜利的有力因素。”
