A True Reflection of the Great Era
——After Viewing the Photography Art Exhibition
	Cheng Mo

The China Photography Society recently held a photography art exhibition, displaying 311 outstanding works created by Chinese photographers over the past decade. The majority of the works on display were created since 1958. Many of the exhibited photographs enthusiastically praised the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes with colorful artistic techniques, and lauded the heroic spirit of the people. The exhibition demonstrated the achievements made by Chinese photography art under the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new.

The exhibition widely and truthfully reflected our era's life. On the agricultural front, we saw the abundant harvests of various agricultural and sideline products. Zhao Liqun's "Celebrating the Establishment of the People's Commune," with its lively composition and rich colors, depicts the peasants enthusiastically waving a giant dragon, cheering the birth of the People's Commune, and expressing the people's surging joy. Works such as "A Picture of Garden-Style Farming," "Terraced Fields," and "Water and Soil Conservation" show that the People's Commune has exerted tremendous power, and the commune members carefully and diligently painted the earth into the most beautiful picture, making the motherland's beautiful mountains and rivers even more magnificent. The achievements of basic construction on the industrial front, the combination of large, medium, and small scale production with both modern and indigenous methods, and the support of industrial production for agricultural production were also reflected. Works such as "The Party Gave Me a Second Life" express the moving deeds on the cultural, educational, and health fronts. These photos recorded the true image of the Great Leap Forward era, leaving people with unforgettable impressions.

Photography art is a weapon of class struggle. Its role is not only to truthfully reflect objective things, but also to stand higher than ordinary life, and become a powerful tool for educating the people, raising their communist ideological awareness, and cultivating their communist moral character. Only in this way can photography art play its fighting role. Judging from the works in the exhibition, photographers have achieved this. They do not stay on the surface phenomena, but strive to explore meaningful themes from life, giving the works thought, and making them weapons for promoting socialist and communist ideas, creating many excellent works. For example, "Peasant Women Teaching" and "Five Women Making Innovations" show that the broad masses of workers and peasants are mastering cultural knowledge, summarizing their rich experience in production struggle, and striving to climb the peak of science. "After Labor" promotes the Party's policy of cadres going to the countryside from the perspective of intellectuals becoming laborers. The close relationship between the cadres sent down and the peasants in the photo shows that the thoughts and feelings of the cadres sent down have undergone great changes. "The Unsinkable Battleship" is a photo depicting the Harbin Cement Plant overcoming floods and continuing production. The cement plant has been submerged in a vast expanse of water, but production is still proceeding as usual under the heroic rescue of workers. Like "Seizing Grain from Dragon's Mouth," it vividly expresses the revolutionary optimism and revolutionary heroism of the Chinese people in fighting against natural disasters and believing that man will conquer nature. "The Harder It Rains, the Greater the Enthusiasm" and "We Must Lead the Tao River up the Mountain" further demonstrate the magnificent spirit of revolutionaries transforming nature. "Exploration Team Members" and others promote the spirit of hard work of the people building a socialist motherland. Photos such as "New Style at the Station" and "Crossing the Road" praise the new moral qualities, indicating that the relationship between people in the new society is undergoing fundamental changes. All these works not only provide us with examples to learn from, but also showcase the splendid picture of new people in the new society.

Photographers have also played a fighting role in the struggle against the enemy, inspiring the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and showing the world our firm determination to support the oppressed people against imperialism. The huge photograph "Chairman Mao is with the People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America" is a photo with high ideological and artistic qualities. It profoundly and vividly expresses the Chinese people's attitude towards the national liberation struggle. Friends from Asian, African, and Latin American countries surround Chairman Mao, expressing their infinite respect and love for the leader of the Chinese people. The joy and friendship between the host and guests embodies our firm support for the oppressed nations' struggle against imperialism and strengthens the friends' fighting beliefs. Many other works expressing anti-imperialist struggle, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and praising the People's Liberation Army express the same theme.

The Chinese people's photography art has been advancing along the correct path of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. It uses vivid images to report the great achievements of socialist construction, praise the heroic figures of our generation, and strike at the imperialist reactionaries, becoming a powerful propaganda weapon of the Party and forming its own glorious tradition of being revolutionary and combative. In the future, as socialist construction accelerates and the anti-imperialist struggle deepens, it will continue to undertake the glorious task of educating the people and inspiring their fighting spirit, and play a greater fighting role.

    伟大时代的真实写照
    ——摄影艺术展览观后
    程默
    中国摄影学会最近举办了一次摄影艺术展览会，展出了我国摄影工作者十年来创作的优秀作品三百一十一件。展出的作品绝大部分是1958年以来创作的。展出的许多摄影作品以绚烂多彩的艺术手法，热情地歌颂了总路线、大跃进和人民公社，歌颂了人民的英雄气概。展览会证明了我国的摄影艺术，在为工农兵服务的方向和百花齐放、推陈出新的方针下取得的成就。
    展览会广泛而真实地反映了我们的时代生活。在农业战线上，我们看到各种农副产品的丰盛收获。赵立群的《欢庆人民公社成立》，以活泼的构图和丰富的色调，表现农民热烈地挥舞着巨龙，欢呼人民公社的诞生，表达了人民沸腾着的欢乐情绪。《园田化的图景》、《梯田》、《水土保持》等作品中，可以看出人民公社发挥了巨大威力，公社社员们精心地、辛勤地把大地描绘成最美的画图，使祖国的锦绣河山更为壮丽。工业战线上基本建设的成就、大中小与土洋生产的结合、工业生产支援农业生产等方面，也都得到了反映。《党给了我第二次生命》等作品则表现了文教卫生战线上的动人事迹。这些照片纪录下了大跃进时代的真实形象，给人留下了难忘的印象。
    摄影艺术是阶级斗争的一种武器，它的作用不仅仅是如实地反映客观事物，而且要求它站得比普通生活更高，成为教育人民、提高人民共产主义思想觉悟和培养人民共产主义道德品质的有力工具。只有这样，摄影艺术才能发挥它的战斗作用。从展览会的作品中看，摄影工作者是作到了这一点的，他们不停留在表面现象上，努力从生活中发掘有意义的题材，给作品以思想，使之成为宣传社会主义、共产主义思想的武器，创作了不少优秀的作品。例如《农妇教学》、《五女闹革新》，表现了广大工农群众正在掌握着文化知识，并总结自己丰富的生产斗争经验，努力攀登科学的顶峰。《劳动之余》则是从知识分子劳动化这个角度来宣传党的干部下放政策的。照片上下放干部和农民融洽无间的那种亲密关系，可以感到下放干部的思想感情已经起了很大变化。《永不沉的战舰》是描写哈尔滨水泥厂战胜了洪水、坚持生产的照片，水泥厂已陷入一片汪洋大海之中，但在工人奋勇抢救下，仍然照常进行着生产；它与《龙口夺粮》一样，生动地表现了我国人民与天灾作斗争、人定胜天的革命乐观主义和革命英雄主义思想。《雨越大干劲越足》与《要把洮河引上山》更表现了革命者改造大自然的雄伟气魄。《勘探队员》等则宣传了人民艰苦奋斗建设社会主义祖国的苦干精神。《车站新风》、《过马路》等照片赞扬了新的道德品质，说明新社会中人与人之间的关系正在起着根本性的变化。所有这些作品，不仅向我们提供了学习的榜样，而且也展示了新社会新人物的灿烂图景。
    摄影工作者在对敌斗争中同样发挥了它的战斗作用，鼓舞了中国人民反对帝国主义的斗争，向全世界表明了我们坚决支持被压迫人民反对帝国主义的决心。巨幅照片《毛主席和亚洲非洲拉丁美洲人民在一起》是一张思想性和艺术性都很高的照片。它深刻而形象地表达了中国人民对民族解放斗争的态度。亚、非、拉丁美洲国家的朋友们围绕着毛主席，表示他们对中国人民领袖无限的尊敬和爱戴；宾主间洋溢着欢乐、友谊的感情，体现出我们坚决支持被压迫民族反帝斗争的态度，加强了朋友们斗争的信念。其他表现反帝斗争、抗美援朝、歌颂人民解放军的许多作品，都表现了同样的主题思想。
    中国人民的摄影艺术，一直沿着文艺为工农兵服务的正确方向前进。它用鲜明的形象，报道了社会主义建设的丰功伟绩，歌颂了我们一代的英雄人物，打击了帝国主义反动派，成为党的一个有力的宣传武器，形成了自己的富有革命性战斗性的光荣传统。在今后社会主义建设加速进行、反帝斗争深入展开的时间里，它将继续担负起教育人民，鼓舞斗志的光荣任务，发挥出更大的战斗作用。
