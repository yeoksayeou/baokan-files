Summarizing Mass Experience, Combining Experimental Research
Ju County Adopts New Measures to Carefully Manage Sweet Potatoes

(Our dispatch) Ju County, Shandong, a major sweet potato (i.e., sweet potato) producing area, through the combination of cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians, has summarized the sweet potato bumper harvest experience over the years, grasped the laws, actively promoted, and appropriately controlled, enabling sweet potato field management to reach a higher level.

This year, the county planted a total of 700,000 mu of spring and summer sweet potatoes, with an average of more than 1.2 mu per person. This year's spring and summer sweet potatoes were not only planted early, but also implemented some reforms in cultivation, universally promoting double-row close planting and intercropping. In order to mobilize the masses to manage sweet potatoes well and win a greater harvest, the county and commune Party committees respectively held symposiums with experienced model workers, experienced farmers, and technicians, combined with the actual operations in "experimental fields" and "command fields", further clarified the laws of sweet potato growth, found the "four stages" and "four preventions" in the sweet potato growth management process, and formulated an operating procedure for sweet potato field management that actively promotes, appropriately controls, and closely combines promotion and control. The "four stages" and "four preventions" are: First, the strong seedling stage. After sweet potato seedlings are transplanted, due to the undeveloped root system and stems and leaves, the resistance is weak. The most important thing is how to accelerate the awakening and strengthening of sweet potato seedlings. According to the experience of experienced farmers, spring sweet potatoes take about 7 to 12 days to awaken and take root, and 20 to 25 days to strengthen seedlings; summer sweet potatoes take about 3 to 5 days to awaken and take root, and 10 to 15 days to strengthen seedlings. During this period, sweet potato seedlings prefer loose soil and fear weeds and insect pests. Therefore, the focus of field management at this time is to strive for early seedling recovery and early seedling strengthening. The main measures are timely early weeding, flood prevention, and insect pest prevention. This year, summer sweet potatoes encountered "blocking flood", the soil was compacted, and weeds were rampant, so it is even more necessary to weed early and carefully, leaving no weeds. In case of drought, small amounts of water should be poured, combined with loosening the soil to preserve moisture. At the same time, we must also prevent and control underground pests such as cutworms, mole crickets, grubs, and wireworms as early as possible, and correspondingly do a good job in mounding and strengthening seedlings of intercropped corn.

Second, the vine growing stage. After the seedlings are strengthened, they begin to grow vines. The vine growing time is about 40 to 50 days. As long as the vines grow sufficiently, they are both drought-resistant and flood-resistant, and also lay a favorable foundation for attacking the sweet potatoes. The most important thing in this stage is to skillfully water, skillfully topdress, and skillfully weed. Generally, apply one to two times of quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer, each time applying 3,000 to 5,000 jin of human manure per mu to meet the needs of plant growth. This year, most of the spring sweet potato vines were cut and planted as summer sweet potatoes, and the base fertilizer applied to the summer sweet potatoes was also small, so more quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer needs to be applied to make up for the deficiency. Weeding should be adapted to local conditions, and it is generally better to weed twice. Weeding sweet potatoes requires better technology, with four taboos and one fear: First, avoid incomplete and unthorough weeding; second, avoid uneven weeding depth, which damages the roots; third, avoid uncleared weeds in the ditch, uncleared weeds, resulting in "returning soul weeds"; fourth, avoid making the ditch backs smaller. One fear is that the soil buries the sweet potato roots during weeding, causing the growth of many hairy roots and reducing production. At the same time, spring corn intercropped within the spring sweet potato fields must be harvested in a timely manner to reduce the impact on sweet potatoes; summer corn intercropped within the summer sweet potato fields must be managed in a timely manner to promote each other.

Third, the sweet potato growing stage. Sweet potatoes grow in large quantities during the month and a half from the Beginning of Autumn to the Autumn Equinox. At this time, sweet potatoes are afraid of both drought and flood, and prefer "yellow moist soil" (soil moisture content 20% to 30%). At this time, it is necessary to control the growth of sweet potato stems and leaves, and also promote the growth of sweet potato blocks. The masses say that sweet potatoes have three kinds of roots: one is hairy roots, the second is adventitious roots, and the third is tuberous roots. Too many hairy roots and adventitious roots are not good, and more tuberous roots grow larger sweet potatoes. Therefore, after the Beginning of Autumn, it is necessary to apply "sweet potato growing fertilizer", preferably before the Limit of Heat, apply more phosphorus and potassium fertilizer, and apply it as liquid fertilizer along the seams. Because the growth of stems and leaves should be controlled, less nitrogen fertilizer should be applied; if the stems and leaves are yellow and thin, a little nitrogen fertilizer can also be applied appropriately. Water should be poured in dry and arid conditions, but prevent flooding. In case of rain and flood, drain the water immediately. We must also pay attention to ventilation, light, insect control, and soil cultivation.

Fourth, the harvest stage. Timely harvesting can prevent frost and ensure safe storage; it also creates conditions for expanding the wheat planting area and timely sowing. According to climatic conditions, spring sweet potatoes should be harvested before the Cold Dew and summer sweet potatoes before the Frost's Descent. In view of the large sweet potato area this year, the harvest should be appropriately advanced.

In order to achieve the above requirements and achieve high standards of field management, the county has established sweet potato management headquarters, command posts, and leading groups from top to bottom, led by secretaries at all levels to strengthen leadership, and divided the county's seventeen communes into three major areas, which are contracted by the county party secretary and standing committee members to take charge and command on the spot. In order to grasp the base points and summarize experience to guide the overall situation, Wang Ancheng, secretary of the county party committee secretariat, established a thousand-mu high-yield sweet potato command field in Aiguo Commune with national model worker Lü Hongbin, experienced farmers, technicians, and others, summarizing experience from it to guide the entire county. In the current weeding campaign, 360,000 mu of spring sweet potatoes have been weeded once, 310,000 mu of summer sweet potatoes have been weeded, and 250,000 mu have been topdressed.

    总结群众经验，结合试验研究
    莒县采用新措施细管甘薯
    本报讯　盛产地瓜（即甘薯）的山东莒县通过干部、老农、技术员三结合，总结历年来地瓜丰产经验，掌握规律，积极促进，适当控制，使地瓜田间管理达到了一个更高的水平。
    这个县今年共种春、夏地瓜七十万亩，每人平均占有一亩二分多。今年的春、夏地瓜不仅栽种早，而且在耕作上实行了一些改革，普遍推行了双行密植和间作套种。为了发动群众管好地瓜，夺取更大丰收，县委、公社党委分别召开了有管理经验的劳模、老农、技术员座谈会，结合“试验田”、“指挥田”内的实际操作，进一步摸清了地瓜生长的规律，找出了地瓜生长管理过程中的“四关”、“四防”，把地瓜田间管理制订出了一个积极促进，适当控制，促进、控制密切结合的操作规程。“四关”、“四防”是：第一、壮苗关。地瓜插秧后，由于根系、茎叶还不发达，抗逆力弱，最重要的是如何加速地瓜醒苗和壮苗。根据老农的经验，春地瓜大约在七至十二天醒苗、生根，二十至二十五天壮苗；夏地瓜大约在三至五天醒苗、生根，十至十五天壮苗。在这段时间内，地瓜苗最喜土壤疏松，最怕草荒、虫害。因此，这时田间管理的重点，是争取早还苗，早壮苗。主要的措施是适时早锄、防涝、防虫害。今年夏地瓜遇到“堵门涝”，土地板结，杂草丛生，就更必须早锄、细锄，不留棵草。如遇干旱应浇小水，要结合松土保墒。同时，还要及早防治地老虎、蝼蛄、蛴螬、金针虫等地下虫害，并相应地作好间作玉米的墩棵、壮苗管理。
    第二、长秧关。壮苗以后，开始长秧。长秧时间大约四、五十天。只要长足了秧子，既抗旱又抗涝，也给攻瓜打下有利基础。这一关最重要的就是巧浇水，巧追肥，巧锄地灭草。一般追一至二遍速效氮肥，每亩每次追人粪尿三千至五千斤，满足植株生长的需要。今年春地瓜大部分剪秧栽了夏地瓜，夏地瓜基肥施的又少，需要多追速效氮肥，以补不足。中耕除草要因地制宜，一般锄二遍较好。锄地瓜需要较好的技术，有四忌一怕：一忌锄不透、锄不严；二忌锄地深浅不均匀，伤了根；三忌锄不净夹垅草，拾不净草，出现“还魂草”；四忌把沟背锄小了。一怕是怕锄地时土埋了地瓜根，多长毛根造成减产。同时，要适时收获春地瓜地内间作的玉米，减少对地瓜的影响；对夏地瓜地内间作的玉米要适时管理，以互相促进。
    第三、攻瓜关。地瓜大量长瓜，是在立秋到秋分这一个半月的时间内。这时地瓜既怕旱，又怕涝，最喜“黄墒土”（土壤含水率20％到30％）。这时，既要控制地瓜茎叶生长，又要促使瓜块生长。群众说地瓜有三种根：一是毛根，二是飞根，三是块根。毛根、飞根多了都不好，块根多长瓜大。因此，立秋后，要追“攻瓜肥”，最好“处暑”前追完，多追磷钾肥，要化为液体顺缝浇追，因控制茎叶生长，应少追氮肥；如茎叶黄瘦时，也可适当追些氮肥。干、旱要浇水，但防止大水漫灌。如遇雨涝，要立即排水。还要注意通风透光、治虫、培土等工作。
    第四、收获关。适时收获可以防止霜冻，保证安全贮存；也为扩大种麦面积、适时播种创造条件。根据气候条件，春地瓜在寒露前、夏地瓜在霜降前收刨为宜。鉴于今年地瓜面积大，应适当提早收获。
    为了实现上述要求，达到田间管理高标准，全县自上而下建立了地瓜管理指挥部、指挥所和领导小组，由各级书记分别挂帅，加强领导，并将全县十七处公社划成三大片，由县委书记、常委包干负责，坐阵指挥。为了掌握基点，总结经验指导全面，县委书记处书记王安成在爱国公社同全国劳模吕鸿宾、老农、技术员等人建立了地瓜千亩丰产指挥田，从中总结经验，指导全县。在当前的锄地灭荒中，全县已有三十六万亩春地瓜普锄一遍，夏地瓜锄了三十一万亩，追肥二十五万亩。
