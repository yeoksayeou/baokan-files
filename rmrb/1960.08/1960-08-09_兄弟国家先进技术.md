Advanced Technologies from Brotherly Countries

　　Soilless Cultivation Greenhouse
　　Soviet scientists have designed a mechanized and automated soilless cultivation greenhouse that can greatly increase agricultural labor productivity.

　　The basic part of this device is a trough filled with gravel, in which the roots of the plants are embedded. The nutrients and water needed for plant growth are obtained by continuously introducing nutrient solution into the trough. The greenhouse is equipped with a nutrient solution processing device, a water pumping station for supplying nutrient solution, etc. The transportation, replacement, and adjustment of the nutrient solution can be controlled on the console.

　　In ordinary greenhouses, the labor days spent on the same crop area are dozens of times more than those spent on the same field area. However, in this mechanized and automated soilless cultivation greenhouse, the labor days required are two-thirds less than those in the field, and the yield is much higher. Using this device can precisely control the plant growth process, eliminate heavy soil preparation work, cultivate vegetables in areas where there is no arable land at all, such as deserts and the North and South Poles, and completely free crops from the effects of diseases, pests and weeds, etc.

　　Automatic Plant Lighting Adjustment Device

　　Leningrad scientist Kalmanov has designed an electronic device for regulating plant illumination for greenhouses. Using this device, plants can automatically "adjust" the conditions needed for their growth and independently "guide" the lighting system to make necessary changes.

　　According to research, when the water metabolism between the leaves of a plant and the outside world is strengthened, the humidity of the air on the surface of the leaves will increase, which indicates that the plant is beginning to urgently need light. A special relay on the automatic device will open the light source due to the increase in humidity. When the humidity decreases, the automatic device will quickly turn off the light source. This automatic device is very sensitive. The electronic device can record even the slightest increase in humidity, so as to immediately respond to this change.

　　Automatic Silkworm Climate Adjustment Device

　　Uzbek scientists have designed a device that can automatically adjust the climate in silkworm rearing rooms. Using this device, the most favorable air temperature and humidity conditions can be created in the silkworm rearing room to promote the normal development of silkworms, accelerate their growth, and increase the cocooning rate.

　　This automatic device is equipped with an automatic air condenser, which can be activated by relays and sensors mounted on the protective panel, so that the room maintains the necessary climate conditions. This electrical device has a simple structure and is reliable in use. It can be connected to any power source, even a mobile power station.

    兄弟国家先进技术
    无土栽培温室
    苏联科学家设计出了一种可以大大提高农业劳动生产率的机械化和自动化的无土栽培温室。
    这种装置的基本部分是一些盛有砾石的槽，植物的根就扎在这些砾石之间。植物生长所需要的营养物质和水分是通过不断通入槽中的营养液来获得的。温室装备有营养液加工装置，供应营养液的水泵站等。营养液的输送、更换和调节可以在操纵台上加以控制。
    在一般的温室中，花在同样作物面积上的劳动日要比花在同样大田面积上的多数十倍，而在这种机械化和自动化无土栽培温室中所需的劳动日却比大田少三分之二，产量还要高很多。利用这种装置可以精确控制植物生长过程，消除繁重的土壤整理工作，可以在沙漠、南北极等根本没有可耕地的地区栽培菜蔬，使作物完全摆脱病虫害和莠草的影响等。
    自动调整植物光照装置
    列宁格勒科学家卡尔马诺夫设计了一种供温室用的调节植物光照的电子装置。利用这种装置，植物可以自动“调节”自己生长所需的条件，自行“指导”光照系统进行必要的改变。
    据研究，当植物的叶子和外界之间水分代谢加强的时候，叶子表面空气湿度就会增高，这就表明，植物开始迫切需要光照。自动装置上的专门继电器就会由于湿度的增加而打开光源。在湿度下降时，自动装置也会迅即关掉光源。这种自动装置反应很灵敏，电子装置可以纪录到极微小的湿度增加，从而对这种情况变化立即作出必要的反应。
    自动调整蚕室气候装置
    乌兹别克科学家设计出一种可以自动调整蚕室气候的装置。利用这种装置可以在蚕室内造成最有利的空气温度和湿度状况，以促进蚕的正常发育，加速蚕的成长，提高成茧率。
    这种自动装置装有一台自动空气冷凝器，它可以通过装在护板上的继电器和传感器起作用，从而使室内维持必要的气候状况。这种电气装置结构简单，使用可靠。它可以接在任何电源上使用，甚至可以接在流动电站上。
