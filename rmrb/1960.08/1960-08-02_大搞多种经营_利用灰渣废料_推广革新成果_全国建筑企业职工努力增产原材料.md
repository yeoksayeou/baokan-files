Xinhua News Agency, August 1st: Workers in construction enterprises across the country are launching a vigorous battle to seize materials, self-reliantly solve the problem of raw materials, and ensure the sustained leap forward in capital construction. A number of advanced units, such as construction companies affiliated with the construction departments of Hebei, Liaoning, and Hunan provinces, and the Third Engineering Bureau directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering, have produced and saved a large number of urgently needed building materials. These units have completed their construction tasks for the first half of the year with overfulfilled quotas, using only 70%-80% of the materials allocated by the state plan.

One of the important ways for construction enterprises in various places to solve the problem of raw materials is to vigorously engage in diversified operations, running their own steel plants, cement plants, brick and tile factories, and paint factories to produce building materials themselves. As of the end of June, the Ministry of Construction Engineering system alone had more than 4,000 small factories, which had produced more than 9,000 tons of steel, more than 120,000 tons of cement, more than 160 million bricks, and 110,000 tons of lime. The Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, by drawing more than 4,000 people to engage in the production of building materials, produced more than 4,000 tons of cement and more than 2 million bricks by May, giving the enterprise the initiative, ensuring the needs of rapid construction, and completing the construction tasks for the first half of the year 33 days ahead of schedule.

Using waste materials to produce new types of building materials is also a major way for construction enterprises in various places to self-reliantly solve the problem of raw materials. According to statistics from 20 units, including the construction departments of Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, and Liaoning, they have recently used industrial waste materials such as slag, coal ash, and wood chips to make 135,000 cubic meters of wet-ground slag concrete, 190,000 tons of gypsum slag cement, more than 70,000 cubic meters of silicate roofing panels and hollow bricks, more than 29,000 cubic meters of lightweight aggregates, more than 800,000 square meters of fiberboard, and more than 90,000 meters of non-metallic pipes. Due to the manufacture and use of new building materials, these units have saved the state 250,000 tons of cement and 120,000 cubic meters of wood.

Using industrial waste to produce new types of building materials can also greatly save transportation capacity and alleviate transportation tensions. For example, Tianjin used to rely on long-distance supply for a large number of building materials such as ash, sand, and stone. This year, the city's construction tasks increased by 70% compared with last year, and the transportation of ash, sand, and stone became very prominent. Since April, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, the construction industry has launched a massive mass movement to comprehensively utilize industrial waste, utilizing most of the city's 17 kinds of industrial waste such as steel slag, iron slag, furnace slag, and fly ash, thus ensuring the completion of construction tasks without increasing or even reducing transportation capacity.

Actively adopting new technologies, vigorously promoting technological innovation and technological revolution achievements, improving material efficiency, and reducing consumption are also important aspects of the material seizure battle in various places. Through the material seizure battle, the application of five new types of advanced structures, such as prestressed concrete structures, thin-shell structures, and suspension structures, has greatly developed. According to incomplete statistics, the Ministry of Construction Engineering system alone has built about 120,000 square meters of various new structure buildings in the first half of this year. These new types of building structures can save a lot of building materials, especially a lot of steel. For example, replacing steel structures with prestressed reinforced concrete structures can save 40%-60% of steel; thin-shell structure roofs can save 30%-50% of steel and cement compared to ordinary reinforced concrete roofs; and steel wire mesh structures used in large-span buildings can save 70%-80% of steel compared to steel structures. Recently, construction units in Shenyang, Lanzhou, Harbin, Qiqihar and other places have adopted these new structures in three- and four-story civil buildings, which not only saved the country 10% of cement and 50% of bricks, but also greatly accelerated the construction progress. Many advanced experiences that have emerged in the technological revolution movement, such as new technologies for cold drawing, cold drawing, cold rolling, cold twisting, and butt welding and spot welding in steel processing, and new machines and tools such as automatic lifting work platforms and hanging basket scaffolding that replace scaffolding, have been widely used in construction enterprises across the country. These new technologies and new experiences have also played a great role in saving building materials.

    大搞多种经营　利用灰渣废料　推广革新成果
    全国建筑企业职工努力增产原材料
    据新华社1日讯　全国建筑企业职工正在开展着一场轰轰烈烈的夺材大战，自力更生解决原材料问题，保证基本建设的持续跃进。一批先进的单位，例如河北、辽宁、湖南等省建筑厅所属建筑公司和建筑工程部直属第三工程局等，已经生产和节约了大量急需的建筑材料。这些单位，仅仅用了国家计划调拨材料的70％—80％，就超额完成了上半年的建筑任务。
  各地建筑企业解决原材料问题的重要办法之一，是大搞多种经营，自己办钢铁厂、水泥厂、砖瓦厂、油漆厂，自己生产建筑材料。截至6月底止，仅建筑工程部系统所办的小型工厂就达到了四千多个，这些工厂已生产出了九千多吨钢材、十二万多吨水泥、一亿六千多万块砖和十一万吨石灰。建筑工程部第三工程局，由于抽出了四千多人搞建筑材料生产，一到5月份就生产出了四千多吨水泥和二百多万块砖，使企业争得了主动，保证了快速施工的需要，提前三十三天完成了上半年的建筑任务。
    利用废料生产新型建筑材料，也是各地建筑企业自力更生解决原材料问题的主要办法。据山西、河南、山东、辽宁建筑厅等二十个单位统计，在最近两个月已经利用炉渣、煤灰、木屑等工业废料，制成了湿碾矿渣混凝土十三万五千立方米，石膏矿渣水泥十九万吨，矽酸盐屋面板、空心砖等七万多立方米，轻质骨料二万九千多立方米，纤维板八十多万方米，非金属管材九万多米。这些单位由于制造和使用新型建筑材料，已经为国家节约水泥二十五万吨，木材十二万立方米。
    利用工业废料生产新型建筑材料，还可以大大节省运力，缓和运输紧张情况。如天津市过去需要的灰、砂、石等大量建筑材料，一直靠远地供应，今年全市建设任务比去年增长70％，灰、砂、石等的运输问题就非常突出。从四月份起，建筑业在市委领导下掀起了一个声势浩大的综合利用工业废料的群众运动，把全市的钢渣、铁渣、炉渣、粉煤灰等十七种工业废料大部分利用起来，这样就在不增加运力甚至少用运力的条件下保证了建筑业任务的完成。
    积极采取新技术、大力推广技术革新和技术革命运动的成果，提高材料效能，减少用量，也是各地夺材大战的一项重要内容。通过夺材大战，预应力混凝土结构、薄壳结构、悬索结构等五种新型先进结构的采用，有了很大的发展。据不完全统计，仅建筑工程部系统今年上半年就已建成各种新结构建筑十二万平方米左右。这些新型建筑结构，都可以节省很多建筑材料，特别是可以节省大量钢材。例如，以预应力钢筋混凝土结构代替钢结构，可以节省钢材40％—60％；薄壳结构的屋盖比普通钢筋混凝土屋盖可节省钢材、水泥各30％—50％；钢丝网结构用于大跨度的建筑物上，比钢结构可以节省钢材70％—80％。最近，沈阳、兰州、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔等地的建筑施工单位，在三、四层民用建筑物上采用这些新结构，不仅为国家节约了10％的水泥和50％的砖，而且大大加快了施工进度。技术革命运动中出现的许多先进经验，例如在钢筋加工方面的冷拉、冷拔、冷轧、冷扭和对焊、点焊等新技术和代替脚手架的自动升降工作台、吊篮脚手等新机具，都已经在全国各地建筑企业广泛应用，这些新技术、新经验对节约建筑材料也起了很大的作用。
