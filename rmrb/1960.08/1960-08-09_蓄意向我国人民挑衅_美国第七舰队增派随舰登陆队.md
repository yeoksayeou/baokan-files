Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Washington dispatch: U.S. Navy officials announced on the 5th that the United States will increase the Marine Corps landing force attached to the U.S. Seventh Fleet, which is carrying out aggressive activities in the coastal waters of China.

Prior to this decision, the United States had already increased the number of aircraft carriers in the Seventh Fleet to strengthen its "offensive power."

It is reported that Washington openly stated that sending additional Marine Corps landing forces to the Seventh Fleet is to "strengthen combat power" and "cope with the ability to deal with sudden outbreaks of war."

It was announced that this landing force, based in Okinawa, will conduct so-called training throughout the Western Pacific region, including Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philippines.

The United States has also taken the same measures for the U.S. Sixth Fleet operating in the Mediterranean region, which is responsible for suppressing national liberation movements in the Middle East and Africa.

    美国第七舰队增派随舰登陆队
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国海军方面5日宣布，美国将向在中国沿海进行侵略活动的美国第七舰队增派海军陆战队登陆队。
    在宣布这个决定以前，美国已经增加了第七舰队的航空母舰以加强它的“进攻力量”。
    据报道，华盛顿方面公然表示，向第七舰队增派海军陆战队登陆队是为了“加强打击力量”和“应付突然爆发的战争的能力”。
    据宣布，这个登陆队以冲绳为基地，要到日本、香港、台湾、菲律宾整个西太平洋地区去进行所谓训练。
    美国还对担负着镇压中东和非洲的民族解放运动任务的在地中海地区活动的美国第六舰队，采取了同样的措施。
