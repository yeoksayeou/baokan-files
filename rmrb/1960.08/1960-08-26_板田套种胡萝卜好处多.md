Intercropping Carrots in Paddy Fields Has Many Benefits

Sowing carrot seeds in paddy fields before the rice harvest is called "intercropping carrots in paddy fields." This is an advanced experience in planting late-autumn crops in southern rice-growing areas.

Intercropping carrots in paddy fields has many benefits:

First, intercropping carrots in paddy fields allows sowing one or two seasons earlier than tilling the fields. This extends the growing period, fully utilizes the cool climate of late autumn to grow strong seedlings, and creates favorable conditions for the later production and accumulation of nutrients, as well as the swelling of the root tubers. Intercropping carrots in paddy fields is generally sown about half a month before the rice harvest (i.e., between the Beginning of Autumn and the End of Heat); tilling the fields for carrots is sown around the White Dew period after the rice harvest. Therefore, intercropped carrots in paddy fields have a relatively longer growing period of more than half a month compared to carrots grown after tilling.

Second, intercropped carrots in paddy fields are protected by rice plants, are not afraid of heavy rain, germinate easily, and can ensure full seedling emergence.

Third, because of the protection of rice plants, the microclimate of the seedling stage is relatively changed, which is more suitable for the requirements of the carrot seedling stage.

Fourth, carrots require loose-textured, well-drained soil for root development. The soil in rice fields before transplanting rice seedlings is generally loosened, making the soil loose and of good texture. With early drainage and drying of the rice fields, the field surface is flat, and the field water is easily drained, while the soil maintains a moist state during sowing, which can meet the needs of germination.

    板田套种胡萝卜好处多
    在水稻收获前把胡萝卜种子撒在水稻田里，叫“板田套种胡萝卜”。这是南方稻区种植晚秋作物中的一项先进经验。
    板田套种胡萝卜的好处很多：
    首先，板田种胡萝卜比耖田的能提早一、二个节令播种，延长了生长期，充分利用晚秋的温凉气候，长好苗稼，为后期营养物质的制造和积累，块根的膨大，创造了有利条件。板田种胡萝卜，一般在水稻收获前半月左右（即立秋至处暑之间）播种；耖田种胡萝卜，则在水稻收后白露前后播种，因此板田胡萝卜比耖田胡萝卜相对的延长半月以上。
    其次，板田胡萝卜有水稻植株作保护，不怕暴雨，发芽容易，并能保证全苗。
    第三，因为有了水稻植株的保护，相对地改变了苗期的小区气候，更适合于胡萝卜苗期的要求。
    第四，胡萝卜要求有质地疏松、排水良好的土壤，才利于根系的发育。水稻田栽秧前的土壤一般经过炕土，土壤疏松，质地良好。在提早水稻排水晾田的情况下，由于田面平整，田水易于排干，播种时土中保持湿润状态，能满足发芽需要。
