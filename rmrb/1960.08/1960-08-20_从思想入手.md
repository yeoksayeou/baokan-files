A mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy, centered on grain and steel, has been launched in various places. This is a nationwide mass movement, and to carry out this movement well and thoroughly, the primary task is to mobilize the masses widely and deeply, and to do a good job in ideological work.

Ideological and political work is the soul and commander of all work. If ideological work is done well, the masses will understand the rationale for launching this movement, and will consciously and proactively stand at the forefront of the movement, rushing towards new goals. From now until the end of the year, there are only four months left. In these four months, can the production of our iron and steel front achieve a greater increase on the basis of the leaps forward in the first seven and a half months, and strive to fully complete and overfulfill this year's industrial production plan? This requires every enterprise and every employee to take immediate action, review their existing achievements, and conduct in-depth and meticulous discussions on the origins of these achievements, and then formulate new goals based on new experiences, and consciously strive to achieve these new goals.

How to mobilize the masses to do a good job in ideological work? In this regard, various places have a lot of experience. Recently, the Party branch of Class C of the No. 1 Branch of Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant came to the conclusion: "Grasp production starting with ideology, and grasp ideology starting with production." This class successfully applied this experience and has consistently maintained the highest output, best quality, and lowest consumption levels among all classes in the factory, becoming a red banner for both increasing production and practicing economy in the factory.

People's ideological state has a direct impact on production. After a product task is determined, in the hands of someone who is vigorous and ambitious, despite encountering this or that difficulty, they will try every means to take various measures, work diligently, and forge ahead courageously, turning great desires into reality. Therefore, to grasp production, one must first start with ideology.

The development of production always progresses in the process of constantly generating problems and constantly solving problems. Reflected in people's thinking, it is also that after solving this problem, that problem appears again. Therefore, as production continues to develop, it is also necessary to constantly grasp ideological issues. Solving ideological problems is to promote the development of production. Therefore, it is said that to grasp ideological problems, one must start with production.

"Grasp production starting with ideology, and grasp ideology starting with production" is a dialectical unity. In the new great movement of increasing production and practicing economy, consistently adhering to this working method from beginning to end, our production will take on a newer look.

    从思想入手
    一个以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动已经在各地展开了。这是一个全民性的群众运动，要把这个运动搞好，搞透，首要的是广泛地深入地发动群众，做好思想工作。
    思想工作和政治工作是一切工作的灵魂和统帅。做好了思想工作，群众懂得了开展这个运动的道理，才会自觉地主动地站在运动的前列，奔赴新的目标。从现在起到年底，总共还只有四个多月了，在这四个多月的时间里，我们的钢铁战线的生产能不能在前七个半月的跃进基础上来一个更大幅度的增长，争取全面完成和超额完成今年的工业生产计划？这就更需要每个企业的每个职工立即行动起来，检阅一下已有的成就，深入细致的讨论这些成绩的由来，然后根据新的经验，制订新的奋斗目标，自觉地为实现这个新的目标而奋斗。
    怎样发动群众做好思想工作？这方面，各地都有不少的经验，最近天津第二钢厂一分厂丙班党支部得出的经验是：“抓生产从思想入手，抓思想从生产出发。”这个班成功地运用这条经验，在全厂各班中一直保持产量最高、质量最好、消耗最低的水平，成为全厂一面既增产，又节约的红旗。
    人们的思想状况对于生产有着直接的影响。一项产品任务确定以后，在朝气蓬勃，具有雄心大志的人手里，尽管碰到这样或那样的困难，他会千方百计采取各种措施，踏踏实实，奋勇前进，使伟大的愿望变成现实。所以抓生产必须先从思想入手。
    生产的发展总是在不断产生问题和不断解决问题中前进的。反映在人们的思想上，也是解决了这个问题，又出现了那个问题，所以，生产不断发展，也就要不断抓思想问题。解决思想问题，是为了促进生产的发展。所以说，抓思想问题，要从生产出发。
    “抓生产从思想入手，抓思想从生产出发”，这是辩证的统一。在新的伟大的增产节约运动中，自始至终地坚持这个工作方法，我们的生产将出现更新的面貌。
