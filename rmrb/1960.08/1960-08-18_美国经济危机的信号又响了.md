Industrial Production Begins to Decline

　　At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, figures of the American ruling clique trumpeted that 1960 "held hope to become the most prosperous year in American history." They estimated that in the first half of this year, the U.S. industrial production index would reach 115 (1957 being 100), national income would increase from last year's $480 billion to $510 billion to $520 billion, and steel production would increase from last year's 93 million tons to 120 million to 135 million tons this year.

　　But things did not develop as the American ruling clique imagined. On the contrary, after the U.S. shook off its most recent crisis in the second half of 1958, its industrial production recovery only lasted for a little over a year. In January of this year, industrial production reached a peak of 111 (1957 being 100), and then began to decline. By March, it had fallen to the level of December last year, 109, a decrease of 2%. It remained stagnant at this point in April. Although it rose slightly to 110 in May, it returned to 109 in June. It is expected to continue to decline in July and August.

　　While industrial production struggled to rise, the New York stock market, which serves as a barometer of the U.S. economy, repeatedly experienced sharp declines. After ten days of price declines, the largest stock market crash of the year occurred on July 25. Of the 1,190 stocks traded that day, prices fell for 805. The eleven-day price decline resulted in a total loss of $3.3 billion in the stock market. The largest declines were in the stocks of industrial sectors such as steel, automobiles, chemicals, railways, and building materials. On August 2, stock prices not only fell again, but trading volume also fell to its lowest level in ten months.

　　The stock market crash shows that the serious unrest mainly comes from the reduction in production in the steel, automobile and other industrial sectors, which are the foundation of American industry. Taking steel production as an example, after the steelworkers' strike last year, the steel monopoly capitalists used the opportunity of reduced steel inventories to launch a speculative production, which made the operating rate of the steel industry reach more than 95% at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. However, the shortage of steel was quickly filled by this frenzy of production, and steel industry production began to decline in February, with the operating rate falling from over 95% in January to 85% at the end of March and 61.9% at the end of May. The steel industry operating rate for the week ending July 10 fell to a dismal 42.7%. The Associated Press pointed out in alarm that this was the first time since the 1958 economic crisis that the U.S. steel industry had fallen below 60% capacity without a strike.

　　Production and sales in the automobile industry are also declining. In the first quarter of this year, the U.S. originally planned to produce 2.25 million vehicles, but only produced 2 million vehicles. Automobile production in the second quarter was even lower at 1.8 million vehicles, a decrease of 10% from the first quarter. The current inventory of unsold cars exceeds one million, forcing a further reduction in production in the third quarter.

　　The phenomenon of declining production and insufficient operating rates is also spreading and developing in many other industrial sectors. In May of this year, residential construction fell by 5% compared with the same period last year. Residential construction costs for the first five months of this year were $19.6 billion, a decrease of 2% compared with the same period last year.

　　Despite the decline in production, unsold inventories are constantly increasing. Currently, the inventory of U.S. enterprises is as high as $93 billion, exceeding the peak of $91.3 billion before the start of the 1957 crisis.

　　Accompanying the decline in production is the increasingly serious problem of unemployment. In June, the number of unemployed in the United States reached 4.42 million, an increase of more than 440,000 from the same period last year. The number of unemployed already accounts for 5.5% of the entire labor force, while the unemployment rate in May 1957 was only 4.1%.

　　The bleak picture of the U.S. economy has caused deep unease among the U.S. ruling clique and business community. They are no longer as optimistic as they were before, and are now downplaying the situation, saying that the U.S. economy has experienced a "semi-recession," a "minor recession," and so on. The "New York Post" wrote on June 6 that the U.S. economic situation in the first five months of this year was a "movement that could be called an economic recession." Graham, a famous American bourgeois economist and former Deputy Director of the Chicago Federal Reserve, said not long ago: "According to the current situation, a major economic panic is imminent." He said that this crisis "may be more serious than the three economic panics that have occurred in our country (referring to the United States) since World War II." Morris, director of the research bureau of the American "Bank Investors Association," also pointed out at the mid-year business outlook conference hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce not long ago, "Signs of an impending recession are becoming increasingly strong, and I think this is a phenomenon that cannot be ignored."

The Factors of Production Recovery in 1958

　　A major feature of U.S. economic development after the war is the shortening of crisis cycles. In the short period of more than ten years since the end of the war, the United States has experienced three economic crises. The first crisis cycle lasted about five years from 1948 to 1953; the second cycle lasted more than three years from 1953 to 1957; and the third cycle has only lasted more than two years from the start of the crisis in the autumn of 1957 to the present. This shows that in the second stage of the general crisis of capitalism, American capitalism is becoming increasingly unstable. The U.S. economy is rotting day by day.

　　This deepening instability of American capitalism is related to the intervention of state monopoly capitalism in the crisis. Originally, the recovery of U.S. industrial production after mid-1958 was not, as usual, caused by the temporary forced resolution of the contradiction between production and consumption after the crisis, but by artificial factors, that is, the intervention of state monopoly capitalism in the economic crisis. This is mainly manifested in the following two aspects:

　　(1) Expanding government spending to stimulate production and consumption: In the 1959 fiscal year (from July 1, 1958 to June 30, 1959), the U.S. federal government spending reached an unprecedented record of $80.9 billion, an increase of $9 billion over the previous year, of which military spending increased by $2 billion, and non-military spending such as agriculture, residential construction, and public works increased by $7 billion. In addition to increasing non-defense expenditures, the U.S. government also took extraordinary measures to artificially maintain the income level of the people, so as not to fall sharply. In 1958, the U.S. government increased allowances for war veterans from the national budget, extended unemployment benefits for three months, increased salaries for national staff by 10%, and gave subsidies to farmers to maintain agricultural product prices, etc.

　　(2) Lowering the discount rate and loosening credit to stimulate investment and purchases: From November 1957, the Federal Reserve Board lowered the discount rate four times, from 3.5% to 1.75%; lowered member bank reserves three times; lowered stock trading margin from 70% to 50%, etc.

　　Due to these measures, U.S. state monopoly capital maintained a certain market purchasing power, thus stimulating the recovery of industrial production.

　　In addition to the intervention of state monopoly capitalism in the economic crisis, in order to continue to extract super profits, the U.S. monopoly capital groups used their large reserves to maintain monopoly high prices in the country. Prices in the United States not only did not fall during the crisis, but rose instead. In 1958, U.S. wholesale prices rose by 4.3% compared with 1956, and retail prices rose by 6.3%. The main method used by U.S. monopoly capital groups to maintain monopoly high prices is to restrict production by closing factories, stopping work, and reducing production, artificially reducing the supply of goods. With the reduction in production, inventories decreased somewhat. When the crisis broke out in August 1957, the inventory of the United States was $91.3 billion, which fell to $90.7 billion by the end of 1957, and then fell to $84.9 billion in October 1958, a decrease of $6.4 billion from the peak when the crisis broke out. On the other hand, the measures taken by the U.S. ruling clique to stimulate production and stimulate consumption artificially increased the demand for goods. At the same time, the continuous inflation of currency made those who held currency eager to turn currency into goods to escape currency devaluation, which also caused an increase in demand for goods. As a result, after a period of decline in U.S. inventories, there was a trend of replenishment, thus stimulating the recovery of production.

Favorable Factors Transformed into Unfavorable Factors

　　Although the intervention of state monopoly capitalism in the crisis prevented the decline in production and the deepening of the crisis, and had a certain impact on the crisis process, it could not eliminate or prevent the crisis.

　　The main function of an economic crisis is to eliminate excess capital and eliminate overproduction, and to temporarily resolve the frequent disproportionality caused by blind production, which is unique to capitalism. However, due to the anti-crisis measures taken by state monopoly capitalism and the measures taken by the U.S. monopoly capital groups to maintain monopoly high prices in the 1957-1958 U.S. economic crisis, its role was not fully exerted. That is to say, in terms of value and material form, the destructive effect of the crisis on excess capital and overproduction was not very serious. As a result, although the crisis has passed, crisis factors still exist. This is manifested in the following aspects:

　　(1) The phenomenon of overproduction has become more serious: Although the national inventory in October 1958 had decreased from $91.3 billion before the crisis to $84.9 billion, it only decreased by 7%. After October 1958, the U.S. inventory increased steadily, rising to $85.2 billion by the end of 1958; rising further to $89 billion by the end of 1959; reaching $90.4 billion at the beginning of this year, and recently rising further to $93 billion, exceeding the level before the last crisis.

　　(2) The phenomenon of insufficient operating rate is still very serious: Usually, the operating rate of U.S. enterprises is about 85%, that is, the phenomenon of insufficient operating rate is about 15%. At the beginning of 1959, although the United States had emerged from the crisis for a little more than half a year, the phenomenon of insufficient operating rate in its heavy industry still reached 20%-25%, and the phenomenon of insufficient operating rate in July this year has reached as high as 50%. During the two intermediate crises in 1948-1949 and 1953-1954, the phenomenon of insufficient operating rate in U.S. industry was only 20%.

　　(3) The phenomenon of unemployment is still serious: According to official figures, the average unemployment rate in 1958 was 4.3%, and the unemployment rate in 1959, excluding the factor of the steelworkers' strike, increased to 5%. This is higher than the unemployment rate before the 1957-1958 crisis.

　　The occurrence of this situation is certainly not accidental. Since the recovery of U.S. industrial production after mid-1958 was mainly due to the stimulation of some temporary factors, they naturally could not last and quickly turned into unfavorable factors that led to the decline of U.S. industrial production.

　　First of all, expanding government spending certainly stimulated production and consumption, but it also inevitably brought difficulties to U.S. finances. The budget deficit for the 1958-1959 fiscal year ending June 30 last year was as high as $12.5 billion, equal to the sum of deficits over the years from the 1946-1947 fiscal year to the 1957-1958 fiscal year, becoming the highest record of U.S. budget deficits in the post-war period. In order to make up for the huge budget deficit, the U.S. ruling clique adopted measures to increase taxes, issue public bonds, and inflate currency. The U.S. government's policy of loosening credit to stimulate production and stimulate consumption further fueled the development of inflation. At the end of 1957, the amount of currency in circulation in the United States (including demand deposits) was $227.7 billion, which increased to $242.6 billion by the end of 1958, and further increased to $246.1 billion by the end of 1959. In just two years, U.S. currency inflated by more than 5%. The direct consequence of inflation is the continuous devaluation of currency and the resulting price increases. The U.S. cost of living index was 120.2 in 1957 (with 1947-1949 as 100), which rose to 123.5 in 1958, further rose to 124.6 in 1959, and further rose to 126.5 in June this year. While the cost of living is constantly rising, workers' real income has decreased instead. The average weekly income of workers after deducting income tax and so-called "social insurance" funds decreased by 85 cents in April this year. As a result, workers' purchasing power fell by about 1.5% in April this year, and 2.5% compared with the same period last year. Similarly, in rural areas, due to the continuous rise in production and living costs and the continued decline in agricultural product prices, the income of U.S. farmers is constantly decreasing. In the past year alone, the income of U.S. farmers has decreased by an average of 16%. In the first quarter of this year, it decreased by another 23% compared with the same period last year. Therefore, although the U.S. ruling clique took measures to maintain the income of a small number of people during the crisis, it still could not offset the decline in the income of the vast working people. This inevitably shrinks the domestic market, deepens the contradiction between production and consumption, and makes the decline in production inevitable.

　　The rise in prices not only weakened the purchasing power of the vast working people, but also increased the cost of industrial and agricultural products, thereby weakening the competitiveness of U.S. goods in the capitalist world market.

Several Unfavorable Economic Factors at Present

　　(1) The level of fixed capital investment is still low: Fixed capital investment by U.S. companies this year is expected to be $36.8 billion, an increase of 13% over last year, but still lower than in 1957. Since the price of plant and equipment has risen by 10%-15% since 1958, the actual investment scale is far less than in 1957. Since this year's fixed capital investment is expected to be mainly concentrated in the manufacturing industrial sector (fixed capital investment in the manufacturing industrial sector will increase by a quarter, and investment in the non-manufacturing industrial sector will increase by 2%-10%), and in the past, fixed capital investment in the manufacturing sector was mainly concentrated in the steel and automobile sectors, but at present, these two industrial sectors are the sectors with the most serious decline in production, so this not only makes the prospects for expanding fixed capital investment bleak, but also has a tendency to shrink.

　　(2) The existence of huge private consumer debt: At present, the private consumer debt of the United States, including mortgage loans, has reached $196 billion, an increase of $21 billion in the past year alone, and another $5.4 billion or 16% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year. The existence of huge private consumer debt means that debtors must pay 25% of their after-tax income to pay the principal and interest due each month, and low-income earners need to pay even more principal and interest due, while ten years ago, debtors only needed to pay 11% of their after-tax income to pay the principal and interest due each month. The existence of huge private consumer debt seriously affects future sales, which is exactly what the American Argus Research Corporation said on May 4 this year: "When we calculate the effective purchasing power of consumers, we must pay attention to the proportion of personal income that has been used to pay installment debt... When most of their purchasing power is absorbed, then their ability to further increase their private consumer debt for other consumption purposes to obtain funds to purchase other things seems to be somewhat limited." It can be seen that the prospects for U.S. private consumption are quite bleak.

　　(3) The foreign market is constantly shrinking: Although the foreign market is not as important to the United States as it is to Britain, Japan, and other countries, it is becoming increasingly important to maintaining U.S. economic activity. At present, 11% of U.S. industrial products and 20% of agricultural products are used for export. But the current situation is that the foreign market is constantly shrinking. The United States mainly has two foreign markets, one is Latin America, and the other is Western Europe. The prospects for these two markets are very unfavorable for U.S. export trade. The increasingly high tide of the national democratic movement in Latin America, especially Cuba's resolute opposition to the interference of U.S. imperialism, has greatly affected U.S. exports to Latin America. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Commerce, in the first quarter of this year, U.S. trade with Latin America "did not improve," and exports decreased by $18 million compared with the same period last year, while U.S. exports to Latin America last year were already significantly lower than the level in 1958, that is, from more than $4.2 billion to $3.59 billion. In the Western European market, the formation of two opposing economic groups and the deepening of tariff barriers will affect U.S. exports to Western Europe to a certain extent. Although the United States has huge investments in Western Europe, U.S. industrial products can bypass the tariff barriers of the six "Common Market" countries through investments in Western Europe, but its agricultural products cannot bypass this tariff barrier. After the six "Common Market" countries begin to implement a unified external tariff on January 1 next year, the tariff rate on U.S. agricultural products will be raised to a very high level. The shrinking of the foreign market will naturally also promote the decline of U.S. industrial production and lead to the recession of economic activities.

Looking for a Way Out in a Dead End

　　In order to delay and cope with the arrival of a new crisis, the U.S. ruling clique is now embarking on the old road of "anti-crisis measures," trying to find a way out in a dead end. The measures they are taking are:

　　(1) Stepping up arms expansion and war preparation: The U.S. monopoly capital groups, which make a fortune from war, are desperately advocating expanding armaments, hoping to use this morphine needle to stimulate production again. According to Western news agency reports, the Eisenhower administration will accelerate the issuance of military procurement contracts to stimulate the economy before stepping down. And politicians from both parties are clamoring in the recent election to use increased spending as a stimulant.

　　(2) Lowering the discount rate and loosening credit to stimulate production and consumption: The U.S. Federal Reserve Board lowered the discount rate from 4% to 3.5% in early June, that is, a decrease of 0.5%. On July 27, it announced that it would reduce the stock trading margin from 90% to 70%.

　　In addition to the above measures, the U.S. ruling clique is also trying to expand exports and export the crisis. U.S. President Eisenhower submitted a plan to Congress on March 17 this year aimed at expanding exports, requesting Congress's cooperation and support. Eisenhower's three methods for expanding exports are: (1) Continuing to put pressure on many other capitalist countries to relax "restrictions" on U.S. goods. (2) Strengthening the measures to enhance the competitiveness of U.S. exporters in the world market, including expanding the assistance of the U.S. government's Export-Import Bank to U.S. exporters, "strengthening the trade promotion agencies of the Department of Commerce," "expanding and prioritizing the commercial activities of overseas agencies," "expanding the agricultural trade promotion activities of the Department of Agriculture," "more emphasis on timely reporting of useful information to U.S. exporters," "establishing new overseas trade centers," "more fully utilizing international trade fairs," and so on. (3) Requiring the U.S. business community to actively cooperate with the government's actions and "organize an export campaign by the business community."

　　This is a fairly large-scale plan to expand exports, which the Associated Press called "the largest export expansion movement in the United States in 40 years."

The Crisis Will Become Inevitable

　　Economic crisis is an inherent product of the capitalist system and cannot be transferred by people's will. These measures taken by the U.S. ruling clique will certainly not avoid the impending economic crisis. This is because overproduction and financial diseases have become deeper and deeper in the United States after the war and are terminally ill. The various artificial measures taken by the U.S. government not only have less and less effect, but will also fall into the difficult situation of balancing both economic and financial difficulties.

　　Nuttel, the financial editor of "U.S. Investors," admitted as early as March this year: "In the upcoming recession, the danger lies not only in the need to overcome over-expansion of credit and excess production capacity, but also in the need to correct the over-inflated stock market; coupled with the current international payment problem, any measures aimed at curbing the recession and relaxing monetary policy will lead to a large outflow of gold and may lead to dollar depreciation and deflation (ie, payment crisis)." He also believes that the United States "either fights the recession it faces and risks the danger of the dollar being squeezed; or tries to protect the dollar and risks the economic recession developing into a great depression." Bell, the publisher of the American "Business Week," also said: The U.S. government "can no longer use massive deficit spending and drastic interest rate reductions as it has in the past to deal with a new recession."

　　These warnings are now beginning to be confirmed by facts. For example, after the Federal Reserve Bank recently lowered the discount rate from 4% to 3.5%, U.S. gold outflows in the last three weeks of July were as high as $158 million, and the payment crisis of massive gold outflows in 1958 was restored. This has forced the U.S. rulers to adopt a so-called "cautious and responsible attitude" towards further loosening of credit.

　　Of course, the current new economic crisis in the United States is only beginning to emerge and has not yet erupted into a sharp decline in production. But the development of the situation, as the British "Financial Times" pointed out in an article on the weakness of the U.S. economy on July 29, "Now Wall Street almost unanimously believes that the economic recession in the early 1960s will be more profound and lasting than the several recessions in the 1950s."

    美国经济危机的信号又响了
    杨湛林
    工业生产开始下降
    去年底今年初，美国统治集团人物曾大吹大擂地说，1960年“有希望成为美国历史上最繁荣的年代”。他们估计，今年上半年，美国工业生产指数将达到115（1957年为100），国民收入将从去年的四千八百亿美元增加到五千一百亿到五千二百亿美元，钢的产量将从去年的九千三百万吨增加到今年的一亿二千万到一亿三千五百万吨。
    可是事情却完全不是照美国统治集团所想像的那样发展。恰正相反，美国在1958年下半年摆脱最近一次危机后，它的工业生产的回升仅仅持续了一年多，到今年1月份工业生产达到111（1957年为100）的最高点后，即开始下降，到3月份降到去年12月份的水平，即109，计下降了2％。4月份仍停滞在这一点上。5月份虽然上升了一点，达到110，可是6月份又回到109。预料7、8两月还将继续下跌。
    在工业生产欲升无力的同时，作为美国经济晴雨表的纽约股票市场也一再发生暴跌。在经过十天的价格下跌以后，7月25日爆发了今年以来美国股票最大的一次跌风。在那天成交的一千一百九十种股票中，价格下跌的占八百零五种。十一天的跌价使这个市场的股票价格共损失了三十三亿美元。下跌最多的是钢铁、汽车、化学品、铁路和建筑材料等工业部门的股票。8月2日股票价格不仅再一次下跌，而且成交额也跌到十个月来的最低水平。
    从股票市场价格的暴跌可以看出，严重的不安主要是来自作为美国工业基础的钢铁、汽车等工业部门的减产。以钢铁生产来说，在去年钢铁工人大罢工后，钢铁垄断资本曾利用钢铁存货减少的机会，掀起了一场投机性的生产，使钢铁工业开工率在去年底今年初达到95％以上。但是钢铁缺货现象很快被这场狂热的生产热潮所填满，从2月份开始钢铁工业生产便开始下降，开工率从1月份的95％以上下降到3月底的85％，5月底的61.9％。到7月10日为止的一周的钢铁工业开工率更惨跌到42.7％。美联社就此惊慌地指出，从1958年经济危机以后，美国钢铁工业这是第一次在没有罢工的情况下开工率下跌到60％以下。
    汽车工业的生产和销售也在不断下降。今年第一季度，美国原拟生产二百二十五万辆汽车，实际只生产了二百万辆。第二季度的汽车产量更低至一百八十万辆，比第一季度又减少了10％。目前卖不出去的汽车存货超过一百万辆，这使它不得不在第三季度继续削减生产。
    生产下降和开工不足现象，也在其他许多工业部门蔓延和发展着。今年5月份，住宅建筑比去年同期降低了5％。今年头五个月的住宅建筑费用为一百九十六亿美元，比去年同期减少了2％。
    尽管生产在下降，但销售不出去的存货却在不断增加。目前美国企业的存货量，高达九百三十亿美元，已超出1957年危机开始前的最高点九百一十三亿美元。
    伴随着生产下降而来的，是失业问题的日益严重。6月份，美国的失业人数高达四百四十二万人，比去年同期增加四十四万多人。失业人数已占整个劳动力的5.5％，而1957年5月的失业率只有4.1％。
    美国经济的黯淡情景，已引起了美国统治集团及工商界人士的深刻不安。他们已不再像先前那样乐观，现在放低了调子说，美国经济出现了“半衰退”、“小衰退”等等。6月6日的“纽约邮报”写道，今年头五个月的美国经济情况是一个“可以称得起经济衰退的运动”。美国著名资产阶级经济学家、前任芝加哥联邦储备局副局长格兰姆不久前说：“根据目前的情况看来，一次重大的经济恐慌即将来临”。他说这次危机“可能比第二次世界大战后我国（指美国）所发生的三次经济恐慌更为严重”。美国“银行投资者联合会”调查局局长摩里斯不久前在美国商会主持的年中商业展望会议上也指出，“一种迫于眉睫的衰退征兆正越来越强烈了，我认为这是不能忽视的现象。”1958年生产回升的因素
    战后，美国经济发展的一个重大特点是危机周期的缩短。在战争结束以来的短短十多年内，美国先后发生了三次经济危机，第一次的危机周期从1948年到1953年约有五年；第二次周期从1953年到1957年有三年多；第三次周期从1957年秋天危机开始到现在只两年多。这说明在资本主义总危机第二阶段，美国资本主义越来越不稳定。美国经济正在一天天烂下去。
    美国资本主义这种日益加深的不稳定性，是同国家垄断资本主义对危机的干涉有关。原来1958年年中以后，美国工业生产的回升，并不是像通常那样，是由于经过危机暂时强制地解决了生产与消费之间的矛盾造成的，而是由于人为因素，即国家垄断资本主义对经济危机的干涉。这主要表现在以下两个方面：
    （一）扩大政府开支以刺激生产和消费：1959财政年度（从1958年7月1日到1959年6月30日止），美国联邦政府开支高达八百零九亿美元的空前纪录，比上一年度增加了九十亿美元，其中军费增加了二十亿美元，农业、住宅建筑以及公共工程等非军事性开支增加了七十亿美元。除增加非国防支出外，美国政府还采取非常措施，用人为的方法维持人民的收入水平，使之不致猛降。1958年，美国政府从国家预算的资金中增加了对战争残废者的津贴，延长对失业工人的救济金三个月，增加国家工作人员的薪金10％，给农场主津贴以维持农产品价格等等。
    （二）降低贴现率，放宽信贷，以刺激投资和购买：从1957年11月起，联邦储备局曾四次降低贴现率，从3.5％降低到1.75％；三次降低会员银行储备金；降低股票交易保证金，从70％降低到50％等等。
    由于采取了这些措施，美国国家垄断资本维持了一定的市场购买力，因而刺激了工业生产的回升。
    除国家垄断资本主义对经济危机的干涉外，美国垄断资本集团为了继续榨取超额利润，利用其拥有的大量后备金，在国内维持垄断的高价。美国的物价在危机期间不仅没有下跌，反而上涨了。1958年，美国的批发价格比1956年上涨了4.3％，零售价格上涨了6.3％。美国垄断资本集团维持垄断高价的办法，主要是用关厂、停工、减产等手段限制生产，人为地减少商品供应量。在缩减生产的情况下，存货量有所减少。1957年8月危机爆发时，美国的存货量是九百一十三亿美元，到1957年底降低到九百零七亿美元，到1958年10月再降低到八百四十九亿美元，比危机爆发时的最高点降低了六十四亿美元。另一方面，美国统治集团所采取的刺激生产、刺激消费的办法，人为地增加了对商品的需求。同时，通货的不断膨胀，使得那些持有货币的人们迫切需要把货币变成商品，以逃避货币贬值，这也造成了对商品需求的增加。结果，美国的存货量在一度减少后，又出现了补进存货的趋势，因而刺激了生产的回升。
    有利因素转化为不利因素
    国家垄断资本主义对危机的干涉虽然制止了生产的下降和危机的加深，对危机进程起了一定的影响，但它决不能消除或制止危机。
    经济危机的主要作用是消灭过剩资本和消灭生产过剩，暂时解决一下资本主义所特有的因盲目生产而造成的经常比例失调现象。可是，1957—1958年的美国经济危机，由于国家垄断资本主义所采取的反危机措施以及美国垄断资本集团所采取的维持垄断高价的措施，并没有充分发挥它的作用，这就是说在价值形式上和物质形式上，危机对过剩资本和生产过剩所起的破坏作用并不十分严重。结果危机虽然过去，但危机因素仍然存在着。这表现在以下几个方面：
    （一）生产过剩现象又趋严重：1958年10月的全国存货量虽已从危机前的九百十三亿美元减少到八百四十九亿美元，但只减少了7％。1958年10月以后，美国存货量又节节上升，1958年底已上升到八百五十二亿美元；1959年底再上升到八百九十亿美元；今年年初达到九百零四亿美元，最近更上升到九百三十亿美元，已超过上次危机前的水平。
    （二）开工不足现象仍然十分严重：通常美国企业的开工率在85％左右，即开工不足现象约为15％。1959年初，美国虽已走出危机有半年多一点的时间，它的重工业的开工不足现象仍达20％—25％，今年7月份开工不足现象已高达50％。而在1948—1949年和1953—1954年两次中间性危机期间，美国工业的开工不足现象也只有20％。
    （三）失业现象仍然严重：按照官方数字，1958年的失业比例平均是4.3％，1959年除掉钢铁工人大罢工的因素之后的失业比例增加到5％。这比1957—1958年危机前的失业率还要高。
    发生这种情况，当然绝非偶然现象。1958年年中以后美国工业生产的回升，既然主要是由于一些暂时性因素的刺激，因此它们自然不能持久，而且很快地就转化为促使美国工业生产下降的不利因素。　
    首先，扩大政府开支固然刺激了生产和消费，但也不可避免地为美国财政带来了困难。到去年6月30日为止的1958—1959财政年度的预算赤字高达一百二十五亿美元，等于自1946—1947财政年度起到1957—1958财政年度为止历年来赤字的总和，成为战后时期美国预算赤字的最高纪录。美国统治集团为了弥补巨额的预算赤字，采取了增加税收、发行公债、膨胀通货的办法。美国政府为刺激生产、刺激消费而实施的放宽信贷政策，更推波助澜地促进了通货膨胀的发展。1957年底，美国流通中的货币量（包括活期存款在内）为二千二百七十七亿美元，到1958年底即增加到二千四百二十六亿美元，1959年底再增加到二千四百六十一亿美元。仅仅两年的时间，美国的通货又膨胀了5％多一点。通货膨胀的直接后果是货币的不断贬值，以及由此而引起的物价上涨。美国的生活费用指数，1957年为120.2（以1947—1949年为100），到1958年已上升为123.5，1959年再上升为124.6，今年6月份更上升到126.5。在生活费用不断上涨的同时，工人的实际收入却相反地减少了。工人扣除了所得税和所谓“社会保险”金后的收入，在今年4月份平均每星期减少了八角五分。结果工人的购买力在今年4月份下降了大约1.5％，比去年同期下降了2.5％。同样，在农村中，由于生产和生活费用不断上涨和农产品价格继续下降，美国农民的收入更是在不断减少。仅在去年一年中，美国农民的收入就平均下降了16％。今年第一季度，比去年同期又下降了23％。因此，尽管美国统治集团在危机期间采取了维持少数人收入的办法，但仍然抵销不了广大劳动人民收入的下降。这就不可避免地缩小了国内市场，加深了生产与消费之间的矛盾，使生产下降成为不可避免。
    物价的上涨不仅削弱了广大劳动人民的购买力，而且也加重了工农业产品的成本，从而削弱了美国商品在资本主义世界市场上的竞争力。
    当前几个不利的经济因素
    （一）固定资本投资水平仍低：今年美国公司的固定资本投资预计为三百六十八亿美元，比去年增加13％，但仍低于1957年。由于厂房设备的价格费用自1958年以来上涨了10％—15％，因此实际投资规模远不及1957年。由于今年的固定资本投资，预计主要集中在制造工业部门（制造工业部门的固定资本投资将增加四分之一，非制造工业部门的投资将增加2％—10％），而以往制造业部门的固定资本投资又主要集中在钢铁和汽车两个部门，可是目前这两个工业部门正是生产下降最严重的部门，因此这就不仅使扩大固定资本投资的前景渺茫，而且有缩减的趋势。
    （二）巨额私人消费债务的存在：目前包括抵押借款在内的美国私人消费债务已达一千九百六十亿美元，仅去年一年就增加了二百十亿美元，今年第一季比去年同期又增加了五十四亿美元，或16％。巨额私人消费债务的存在，债务人每月必须以纳税后收入的25％支付到期的本息，低收入者需要支付的到期本息还要多些，而十年前债务人每月需支付的到期本息只占纳税后收入的11％。巨额私人消费债务的存在，严重地影响了今后的销售，这正是美国亚格斯研究公司今年5月4日所说的：“在我们计算消费者的有效购买力时，我们必须注意个人收入中已经用来偿付分期付款债务的部分所占的比例，……当他们的大部分购买力被吸住，那末他们为了其他消费的目的而进一步增加他们的私人消费债务，以获取资金购买另外东西的能力似乎将多少受到限制。”可见，美国私人消费的前景是相当黯淡的。
    （三）国外市场在不断缩小：国外市场对美国来说，虽不如英国、日本等那样具有十分重要的意义，但它对维持美国的经济活动已日益重要。现在，美国工业品的11％、农产品的20％用于出口。可是目前的情况是，国外市场在不断缩小。美国的国外市场主要有两个，一个是拉丁美洲，一个是西欧。这两个市场的前景，对美国的出口贸易来说，都是非常不利的。日益高涨的拉丁美洲的民族民主运动，特别是古巴的坚决反对美帝国主义的干涉，使美国对拉丁美洲的出口受到很大影响。据美国商务部的报告，今年第一季度，美国对拉丁美洲的贸易“没有起色”，输出额比去年同期减少了一千八百万美元，而去年美国对拉丁美洲的输出已经大大低于1958年的水平，即由四十二亿余美元减少到三十五亿九千万美元。在西欧市场上，两个对立的经济集团的形成和关税壁垒的加深，将使美国商品对西欧的输出受到一定程度的影响。尽管美国在西欧有着巨额的投资，美国工业品可以通过在西欧的投资绕过“共同市场”六国的关税壁垒，但它的农产品却无法绕过这一关税壁垒。“共同市场”六国于明年1月1日开始实施统一对外关税后，对美国农产品税率将提到很高的水平。国外市场的日益缩小，自然也将促使美国工业生产下降，并导致经济活动的衰退。
    死胡同里寻找出路
    为了延缓和应付新的危机的来临，现在美国统治集团又开始走上了“反危机措施”的老路，企图在死胡同里寻找出路。它们采取的措施是：
    （一）加紧进行扩军备战：靠战争发财的美国垄断资本集团又在拼命鼓吹扩充军备，指望用这支吗啡针再来刺激一下生产。根据西方通讯社消息，艾森豪威尔政府在下台之前将加速发放军事订货合同来刺激经济。而两党政客在最近的竞选中更是叫嚷要用增加开支来作兴奋剂。
    （二）降低贴现率，放宽信贷，以刺激生产和消费：美国联邦储备局于6月初把贴现率从4％降低到3.5％，即降低0.5％。7月27日又宣布把股票交易保证金从九成减为七成。
    除上述措施外，美国统治集团还力图扩大出口，输出危机。美国总统艾森豪威尔于今年3月17日向国会提出了一项旨在扩大输出的计划，要求国会合作和支持。艾森豪威尔提出的扩大出口的办法有三点：（1）继续对其他许多资本主义国家施加压力，使它们放宽对美国商品的“限制”。（2）加强美国的出口商在世界市场上的竞争能力的措施，其中包括由美国政府的进出口银行扩大对美国出口商的帮助，“加强商务部的促进贸易机构”，“扩大和优先重视驻国外机构的商务活动”，“扩大农业部的农业贸易促进活动”，“更强调及时向美国出口商报告有用的情报”，“设立新的海外贸易中心”，“更充分地利用国际贸易博览会”等等。（3）要求美国企业界大力配合政府的行动，“组织一次企业界的出口运动”。
    这是一个规模相当大的扩大出口运动的计划，美联社称之为“美国四十年来最大的一次扩大出口运动”。
    危机将成为不可避免
    经济危机是资本主义制度所固有的产物，是不以人们的意志为转移的。美国统治集团所采取的这些措施，当然不能避免即将爆发的经济危机。这是因为战后生产过剩和财政金融病症在美国已是愈来愈深，病入膏肓。美国政府采取的各种人为措施，其作用不但愈来愈小，而且将陷入经济和财政两难兼顾的困难处境。
  “美国投资者”金融编辑纳特尔早在今年3月就承认：“在即将到来的衰退中，危险不仅在于需要克服过度扩张的信贷和过剩的生产能力，而且还需要纠正过度膨胀了的股票市场；再加上现在还有国际支付问题，因此任何旨在制止衰退而采取放松银根的措施，将会导致黄金大量外流，并有可能导致美元贬值和通货收缩（即支付危机）。”他还认为，美国“要末与面临的衰退作斗争，而冒美元有被挤兑的危险；要末竭力保护美元，而冒经济衰退有发展成为大不景气的危险。”美国“商业周刊”的发行人贝尔也说：美国政府“已不可能再像过去那样运用大量赤字开支和猛烈降低利率的措施来对付一次新的衰退了”。
    这些警告现在已开始为事实所证实。譬如在联邦储备银行不久前把贴现利率从4％降到3.5％以后，在7月份后三星期中美国黄金外流已高达一亿五千八百万美元，又恢复了1958年大量黄金外流的支付危机。这就迫使美国统治者不得不对进一步放松信贷采取所谓“慎重、负责的态度”。
    当然，目前美国新的经济危机仅是开始露头，还没有爆发为生产的急剧下降。但是形势的发展，正如英国“金融时报”7月29日在一篇论美国经济虚弱的文章中所指出的，“现在华尔街几乎一致认为，1960年代初期的经济衰退将比1950年代的几次衰退要深刻和持久”。
