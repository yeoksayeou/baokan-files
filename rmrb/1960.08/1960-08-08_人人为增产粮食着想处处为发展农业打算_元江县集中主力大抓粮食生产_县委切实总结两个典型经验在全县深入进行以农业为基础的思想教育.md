Everyone thinks about increasing grain production, everywhere planning for the development of agriculture.
Yuanjiang County concentrates its main force to vigorously grasp grain production.
The County Party Committee earnestly summarizes two typical experiences and conducts in-depth ideological education based on agriculture throughout the county.
70% of the labor force, 70% of the strong labor force, 70% of the Party and Youth League members, and 70% of the leading cadres have been concentrated on the agricultural front; 85% of the labor force within agriculture has been concentrated to vigorously grasp field management of grain crops.

(Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 6th) The Yuanjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Yunnan Province has helped leaders at all levels of communes, management districts, and production teams, as well as cadres from all walks of life in industry, commerce, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, to establish the idea of agriculture as the foundation. All levels and all sectors in the county are thinking about grain and planning for agriculture in every way, doing everything possible to tap labor resources for agriculture, resulting in significant changes in the arrangement and use of labor. The county's labor arrangement has seen two major concentrations and four 70%s. The two major concentrations are the concentration of labor from all sectors of the county to agriculture, and the concentration of 85% of the labor force within agriculture to the field management of current grain crops; the four 70%s are that agricultural labor accounts for more than 70% of the county's labor force, strong agricultural labor accounts for more than 70% of all strong labor, more than 70% of Party and Youth League members are on the agricultural front, and more than 70% of the leading cadres are in charge of agriculture. With the change in the labor lineup, the situation in agricultural production is getting better and better. The county's plan to plant 25,000 mu of late rice has been overfulfilled, more than 20 days ahead of last year. The first weeding has already been completed, and efforts are being made to continue expanding the planting area. The daily progress of inter-tillage and late autumn crop sowing in the county has also increased several times. The second weeding of mid-season rice has long been completed, and half of the third weeding has also been completed, leading the province in mid-season rice weeding. Industrial production has also overfulfilled its plans month after month due to vigorous technical innovation, which has multiplied work efficiency. This year, the county originally planned to increase 500 threshing machines, but more than 700 have already been produced, and more than 200 have been transported to the communes. The quality of these threshing machines is better than in the past, and the cost is also lower.

In order to help the communes deploy their combat forces according to the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link, and comprehensively developing diversified operations, the Yuanjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly investigated the situations of Watuo Commune and Beize Management District of Yinyuan Commune, which differed greatly in the arrangement and use of labor. Watuo Commune concentrated 70% of its labor force to rush inter-tillage and sowing of late autumn crops. When the county had only completed 48% of the second weeding, they had already completed more than 80%. The main reason why this commune was able to unswervingly concentrate its main labor force, strengthen the agricultural front, and vigorously grasp the current production was that it drew beneficial experience from the fact that agriculture in the commune had first achieved a great leap forward in the past two years, thereby promoting the overall great leap forward of the entire commune's economy. In the great leap forward of 1958, agriculture in Watuo Commune was not done well enough, and it needed the state to supply grain. The development of animal husbandry, commune-run industry, and sideline occupations was also not significant. Last year, the commune party committee learned its lesson, concentrated its superior forces, and vigorously grasped grain production, winning a bumper harvest. Grain production increased by 43% compared with 1958, turning it from a grain-deficient commune for many years into a grain-surplus commune. With grain, all other tasks became much more proactive. The entire commune retained fine feed according to regulations, promoting the great development of animal husbandry, with income equivalent to three times that of 1958; other industries also had rapid development, with income from industry and sideline occupations increasing sixfold, and the average wage of commune members more than doubling. Since the spring plowing this year, this commune has always concentrated its main labor force on field production, not only with fast and high-quality transplanting and inter-tillage progress; but also industry and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have also developed accordingly due to the appropriate arrangement of labor. The number of pigs in stock has increased by 60% compared with the same period last year, and the sales task has been overfulfilled by 72% in the first half of the year. The net income from industry and sideline occupations in the first half of the year increased by more than two times compared with the same period last year. Wages were paid to commune members every month, and the average wage of commune members increased by half compared with the same period last year. The situation in Beize Management District of Yinyuan Commune was exactly the opposite. From June 25 to July 25, this management district needed a total of 9,000 labor days for inter-tillage, applying topdressing fertilizer, and accumulating green manure, accounting for more than 70% of the total labor days in the month, while the actual labor force invested in this work in the entire management district accounted for only about 31%, including only one Party member, five Youth League members, and four cadres. However, industry, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and logistics departments accounted for more than 33% of the labor force, including five Party members, six Youth League members, and nine cadres. Many full laborers were doing the work of half laborers, weeding experts were used to cook pig feed, and twenty-year-old young men went to steam fragrant oil. The labor force for reclaiming wasteland also accounted for more than 32%, including two Party members, three Youth League members, and five cadres. Therefore, the speed of inter-tillage was very slow, and the weeds in some fields were as tall as the seedlings.

The Yuanjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China concentrated cadres at the county, commune, management district, and production team levels in the vertical aspect, and concentrated leading cadres from county-owned industry, commerce, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and cultural and educational departments in the horizontal aspect to hold separate meetings, using the typical cases of Watuo Commune and Beize Management District and the rise of ethnic minority industries in Yuanjiang County to conduct in-depth ideological education based on agriculture. Cadres at all levels and in all sectors were greatly educated by the contrast between Watuo Commune and Beize Management District. In recalling the process of the rise of industry in Yuanjiang County, cadres from all departments further recognized the principle that agriculture is the foundation for the development of the national economy. Yuanjiang County is inhabited by more than 80,000 people of thirteen ethnic groups including Han, Dai, Yi, and Hani, with ethnic minorities accounting for more than 80%. In the past, production technology was relatively backward, and grain yields were very low. There was almost no industry in the county, with only two blacksmith furnaces in the entire county, and all agricultural tools were supplied from outside. This situation continued until 1957. In the great leap forward of 1958, agriculture in Yuanjiang County achieved a bumper harvest, with grain and sugarcane production increasing by more than 30%, which created favorable conditions for the development of industry and led to the establishment of machinery, sugar-making, and other factories. Now, Yuanjiang County can manufacture its own horse-drawn water pumps, cotton gins, and sugar presses. Everyone used facts to prove that county-owned industry and commune-run industry can only serve agriculture honestly, and only when agricultural production continues to leap forward can the county and commune industries themselves continue to leap forward. When the cadres of the Yuanjiang Sugar Factory came to the meeting, they asked to increase 300 laborers, but now they not only automatically cancelled the plan to ask for people, but also squeezed out people from technical innovation to run a paper mill, and also transferred more than 50 people to run a machinery repair shop specializing in repairing agricultural machinery for the commune. Cadres from commerce and cultural and educational departments also put forward the slogan of "planning for agriculture in everything and thinking about grain for everyone."

After the ideological problems were solved, cadres and the masses at all levels and in all industries came up with many ways to tap labor resources to support agriculture. The main aspects were: on the one hand, squeezing out forces from all sectors to support agriculture, ensuring that 70% of the county's labor force is used on the agricultural front; on the other hand, reasonably arranging and using labor within the people's communes, so that 85% of the labor force is used on the front line of production. In the past, there were about 3,000 logistics personnel at all levels in the county, accounting for more than 8% of the county's labor force. More than 1,000 people saved by the cooking utensil reform half a year ago remained in the logistics department, and this time they were all transferred to agricultural production. In the first half of the year, animal husbandry promoted feed vaporization, semi-mechanized feed crushing, and self-flowing drinking water, and more than 1,000 people saved were not transferred out, and this time they were also transferred to participate in agricultural production. County-owned factories and mines vigorously carried out technical innovation, saving more than 160 people to invest in agriculture, accounting for more than 10% of the number of employees in county-owned factories and mines. Commune-run industries have also saved a lot of people to strengthen agriculture. For example, the iron and wood factory of Honghe Commune manufactured a native planer, which increased work efficiency more than 70 times compared with manual operation, saving 105 people for agricultural production. Communes temporarily suspended those capital construction projects that could be suspended, and at the same time, according to the principle of "one specialty with multiple skills," compressed non-agricultural production personnel. In this way, all levels and all sectors of the county drew out a total of more than 7,000 people to support agriculture. The agricultural labor force increased from 19,500 to more than 27,000, accounting for more than 70% of the county's labor force; more than 23,000 people were on the front line of inter-tillage production, accounting for 85% of the agricultural labor force. In the past, many strong laborers in animal husbandry and sideline production were doing the work of half laborers. Now, half laborers have been used to replace more than 2,700 full laborers to engage in inter-tillage and summer hoeing. Coupled with the strong and healthy laborers drawn from other departments, strong agricultural labor has reached more than 70%; more than 70% of Party and Youth League members and more than 70% of leading cadres in the county have also been concentrated on the agricultural front.

    人人为增产粮食着想处处为发展农业打算
    元江县集中主力大抓粮食生产
    县委切实总结两个典型经验在全县深入进行以农业为基础的思想教育
    全县70％的劳力、70％的强劳力、70％的党团员、70％的领导骨干已集中在农业战线；农业内部劳力已集中85％大抓粮食作物田间管理
    本报昆明6日电　云南省中共元江县委帮助公社、管理区、生产队各级领导与工业、商业、林、牧、副、渔各行各业纵横两条战线的干部树立以农业为基础的思想，全县各级和各行各业人人为粮食着想、事事为农业打算，千方百计为农业挖掘劳动力，使劳动力的安排和使用发生了很大变化。全县劳力安排出现了两大集中和四个70％。两大集中是全县各行各业的劳动力向农业集中，农业内部85％的劳动力又集中到当前粮食作物的田间管理上；四个70％是农业劳动力占全县劳动力的70％以上，农业内部的强劳动力占全部强劳动力的70％以上，70％以上的党、团员在农业战线上，70％以上的领导骨干管农业。随着劳动阵容的变化，农业生产的局面越来越好。全县二万五千亩晚稻栽种计划已超额完成，比去年提前了二十多天。现在已经薅完了第一道草，并争取继续扩大种植面积。全县的中耕和晚秋作物的播种日进度也成倍地增加，早已完成了中稻第二道薅锄，第三道薅锄也完成了一半，在全省中稻薅锄中遥遥领先。工业生产由于大搞技术革新，工效成倍提高，也月月超额完成计划。今年全县原计划增加五百部打谷机，现已生产了七百多部，有二百多部已运到公社。这些打谷机的质量比过去好，成本也比过去低。
    为了帮助各公社按照以农业为基础和以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针部署战斗力量，中共元江县委曾及时地调查了在劳动力安排和使用上完全不同的洼垤公社和因远公社北泽管理区的情况。洼垤公社集中了70％的劳力突击中耕和播种晚秋作物，在全县第二道薅锄才完成了48％的时候，他们已经完成了80％以上。这个公社所以能够坚定不移地集中主要劳力，加强农业战线，狠抓当前的生产，主要原因是从公社近两年来农业首先获得大跃进从而促进了整个公社经济全面大跃进的事实中吸取了有益的经验。在大跃进的1958年，洼垤公社农业搞得不够好，需要国家供应粮食，畜牧业、社办工业、副业的发展也不大。去年，公社党委吸取了教训，集中优势兵力，狠抓粮食生产，赢得了大丰收。粮食比1958年增产了43％，由多年的缺粮社变成了余粮社。有了粮食，其他各项工作就主动得多了。全公社按规定留下了精饲料，推动了畜牧业的大发展，收入相当于1958年的三倍；其他各行业也都有飞跃的发展，工业和副业的收入增加了六倍，社员的平均工资增加了两倍多。今年春耕以来，这个公社始终把主要劳力集中用于田间生产，不但栽插和中耕进度快、质量好；而且工业和林、牧、副、渔业，由于安排了适当的劳力，也相应地得到了发展，生猪存栏数比去年同期增加了六成，上半年已超额72％完成了出售任务。工业、副业的纯收入，上半年比去年同期增加了两倍多。每个月都给社员发了工资，社员的平均工资比去年同期上升了一半。因远公社北泽管理区的情况恰好相反，这个管理区6月25日至7月25日中耕、施追肥、积绿肥等工作共需要九千个劳动日，占全月总劳动日的70％以上，而全管理区实际投入这项工作的劳力只占31％左右，其中只有一个党员、五个团员和四个干部。工业、林、牧、副、渔业和后勤部门却占了33％以上的劳力，其中有五个党员、六个团员和九个干部。有不少全劳动力作半劳动力的活，薅秧能手被用于煮猪食、二十岁的小伙子去蒸芳香油。开荒的劳动力也占32％以上，其中有两个党员、三个团员和五个干部。因此中耕的速度很慢，有些田里的草和秧苗一般高。
    中共元江县委从纵的方面集中县、社、管理区、生产队四级干部，又从横的方面集中县属工业、商业、林、牧、副、渔业和文教部门的领导干部分别开会，用洼垤公社和北泽管理区的典型事例以及元江县少数民族工业兴起的过程，深入地进行以农业为基础的思想教育。各级和各行各业的干部都从洼垤公社和北泽管理区的对比中受到了很大教育。在回忆元江县工业兴起的过程中，各部门的干部又进一步认识了农业是国民经济发展的基础的道理。元江县居住着汉、傣、彝、哈尼等十三个民族的八万多人民，少数民族占80％以上，过去生产技术比较落后，粮食产量很低。县里几乎没有工业，全县只有两盘打铁炉，所有的农具都由外地供给。这种情况一直继续到1957年。1958年大跃进中，元江县农业获得了大丰收，粮食和甘蔗都增产了三成多，这才为发展工业创造了有利条件，才办起了机械、制糖等工厂。现在，元江县已能自制马拉抽水机、榨花机、榨糖机了。大家用事实证明：县属工业和社办工业只有老老实实地为农业服务，农业生产持续跃进了，才能使县、社工业本身持续跃进。元江糖厂干部来开会的时候，要求增加三百个劳动力，现在不但自动撤销了要人的计划，还从技术革新中挤出人来办纸厂，并另调出了五十多人办个机械修配厂专为公社修理农业机械。商业和文教等部门的干部也都提出了“事事为农业打算，人人为粮食着想”的口号。
    思想问题解决以后，各级与各行业的干部和群众想出了许许多多办法来挖掘劳动力支援农业。其中主要的是两方面，一方面是从各行各业中挤出力量来支援农业，确保全县70％的劳动力用在农业战线上；另一方面是人民公社内部合理地安排和使用劳动力，使85％的劳动力用在生产第一线上。原来全县各级后勤人员有三千人左右，占全县劳动力的8％以上，半年来进行炊具改革节约的一千多人仍留在后勤部门，这次都调出来投入农业生产。上半年畜牧业推广饲料蒸气化、饲料粉碎半机械化和饮水自流化，节约的一千多人原来没有调出，这次也调出来参加农业生产。县属各厂矿大搞技术革新，已节约出一百六十多人投入农业，占县属厂矿职工人数的10％以上。社办工业也节约出很多人加强农业，如红河公社的铁木工厂自制出一台土刨床，比人工操作提高工效七十多倍，节约了一百零五人用于农业生产。各公社暂时停办那些可以停办的基建项目，同时根据“一专多能”的原则，压缩非农业生产人员。这样全县各级、各行各业抽出来支援农业的人共达七千多人，农业劳动力由一万九千五百人上升到二万七千多人，占全县劳动力的70％以上；在中耕生产第一线的劳动力有二万三千多人，占农业劳动力的85％。过去畜牧业和副业生产中有不少强劳动力干半劳动力的活，现在已用半劳动力换出了二千七百多个全劳动力投入中耕夏锄，再加上由其他部门抽出来的精壮劳动力，农业内部的强劳动力已达到了70％以上；全县70％以上的党、团员和70％以上的领导骨干，也都集中在农业战线上。
