Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch, August 25th: A press conference was held at the Soviet Academy of Sciences on the 24th for Soviet and foreign journalists to introduce the cosmic flight of the Soviet second spaceship.

Academician Topchiev, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, pointed out at the beginning of the press conference that the flight of the second spaceship was "a new and outstanding achievement of Soviet science in preparing for human flight into space to other celestial bodies." After listing the achievements of the Soviet Union since the launch of the first artificial satellite, Topchiev emphasized the peaceful nature of Soviet space exploration. He said, we only work for science. Our spaceship flight plan does not include reconnaissance purposes that would harm other countries. Soviet Earth satellites are not reconnaissance satellites, but scientific laboratories, whose purpose is to study outer space and enrich human knowledge about the universe.

Topchiev pointed out that continuously increasing the weight and volume of Soviet artificial satellites and space rockets is the basic scientific and technological route of experimental design work, and its only purpose is to build spaceships with all the necessary conditions for human flight into space.

Topchiev said that Soviet scientists and engineers are using the accumulated experience to directly prepare for human space flight. The issue of human flight into outer space is a big issue, and although many investigations have been carried out, a whole series of experimental launches will still be carried out in the future to solve many issues related to the safety of human stay in outer space and their return to Earth.

He pointed out that the historical flight results of the second spaceship proved that living organisms can safely fly in outer space and return to Earth. The first batch of cosmonauts - experimental animals, plants, and microorganisms - have been handed over to scientists. They will explain what still needs to be done to make people passengers in spaceships in the near future. He emphasized that this is our goal, and it will definitely be achieved. He said that Soviet scientists will provide scientists all over the world with the scientific investigation results obtained during the flight of the second spaceship. "The lofty goal of peaceful Soviet science - science that serves only peace and human happiness - lies in this."

Academician-Secretary Sisakyan of the Biological Department of the Soviet Academy of Sciences introduced the biological investigation plan for the flight of the second satellite-type spaceship.

Sisakyan said that all the organisms sent into space by the spaceship are characterized not only by the complexity of their species, but also by the different degrees of reaction to various factors in the cosmic environment.

Sisakyan then talked about the basic tasks proposed before the launch of the second satellite spaceship. The primary task is to study the characteristics of life activities of organisms under space flight conditions. In particular, the biological effects of the main factors of flight - hypergravity, weightlessness, and acceleration - were studied. Great attention was also paid to studying the influence of space flight conditions on organisms from a genetic point of view.

Academician Palin of the Academy of Medical Sciences said that the biologists and physicians preparing animals for space flight have strived to fully utilize the space provided to them on the satellite spaceship for experiments. As a result of these efforts, the animal container has become a modern "Noah's Ark" model that meets the scientific requirements of the twentieth century.

Among the inhabitants of this unique "Ark" are dogs, which are standard objects of investigation. It is the most suitable experimental animal in studying the most important issue of solving the impact of space flight on extremely important physiological systems. First: The reactions of the dog's blood circulation and breathing to changes in external environmental conditions are, generally speaking, quite similar to those of humans under similar conditions; Second: Dogs can adapt well to long-term experimental conditions and are easy to conduct numerous medical examinations. In this regard, even monkeys, which are similar to humans in terms of evolutionary development, are not as good as dogs.

The famous physicist Vernov introduced to reporters the large amount of investigation work on cosmic radiation carried out during the flight of the spaceship. He said that only Earth-space-Earth flights can obtain photos of this radiation.

The second spaceship also had photographic emulsion instruments for studying the nuclei of original cosmic radiation. Such experiments can only be carried out on spaceships that can guarantee a return to Earth.

Professor Shklovsky said that new data on short-wave radiation emitted by the sun was obtained during the flight of the second spaceship.

Then, questions were asked by the reporters. One question mentioned that Eisenhower said that the United States was ahead of all countries in the world in exploring the universe. Topchiev replied that now the whole world can see that the Soviet Union is ahead in this regard. The return of containers with animals to Earth is a direct prelude to human flight into space.

A reporter quoted a British scientist as saying that the Soviet Union could send people into space at any time, possibly within the next few months. Topchiev replied that Soviet scientists believe that further experiments are needed in this regard to improve all systems of the spaceship until it can be certain that human flight and return are completely safe.

Topchiev pointed out that the Austrian newspaper's argument that the Soviet Union's achievements in studying the universe seemed to be a side effect of developing military industry was absurd. The newspaper also said that the Soviet Union's achievements seemed to be due to the seizure of Nazi Germany's rocket technology center at the end of the war. Topchiev emphasized: Many German engineers, including Braun, are working in the United States, but the United States' backwardness in this regard is undeniable.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch, August 24th: According to TASS reports, some Soviet scientists have recently made speeches and articles, talking about the automatic control and radio equipment of the Soviet second spaceship.

Academician Ambartsumian of the Soviet Academy of Sciences published an article in the Soviet "Pravda" on the 24th, saying that the Soviet spaceship landed from its orbit according to instructions issued from the ground by Soviet scientists at a pre-selected moment, and the landing site of the spaceship was also pre-selected. This is very important. This proves that the very sophisticated control mechanism works perfectly, and great progress has been made in the development of remote control equipment, and it also proves that all automatic equipment works very well. The new victory of Soviet science and technology is an important step in realizing human arrival on other planets and their satellites.

Soviet radio electronics expert Pistorhkols emphasized that radio electronic equipment played an extremely important role throughout the entire experiment of the spaceship. The work of the braking device and control system of the spaceship returning to the ground was realized through this device. During the flight, the work of three channels between the spaceship and the ground was realized using this device: the telemetry channel, the television channel used for the first time in cosmic radio communication practice, and the remote control channel.

Another radio electronics expert, Vinogradov, wrote in "Labor Daily" that the quality of the television transmitting tube installed on the spaceship was very high. He also pointed out that what was installed on the spaceship was actually a small television center with a full set of transmitting active television images.

He said that the successful transmission of television from space this time confirms the possibility of Soviet scientists using satellites to transmit television to vast areas of the ground in the near future. In this way, the television reception range will be greatly expanded.

    苏联科学家谈第二个宇宙飞船的意义
    人类准备宇宙飞行又获卓越成就
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：24日在苏联科学院举行了苏联和外国记者招待会，介绍苏联第二个宇宙飞船的宇宙飞行。
    苏联科学院副院长托普切夫院士在宣布记者招待会开始时指出，第二个宇宙飞船的飞行是“苏联科学在准备人飞入宇宙到其它天体去的方面一个新的卓越成就”。托普切夫在历述苏联自发射第一个人造卫星以来的成就后，着重指出了苏联宇宙空间考察的和平性质。他说，我们只为科学工作。我们宇宙飞船的飞行计划中不包括损害它国的侦察目的。苏联地球卫星不是侦察卫星，而是科学实验室，其目的在于研究宇宙空间，丰富人类关于宇宙的知识。
    托普切夫指出，不断增加苏联人造卫星和宇宙火箭的重量和体积，是试验设计工作的基本科学技术路线，其唯一目的在于建造拥有人飞入宇宙所必须的一切条件的宇宙飞船。
    托普切夫说，苏联科学家和工程师利用已积累的经验，已经着手直接准备人的宇宙飞行。人飞入宇宙空间的问题是一个很大的问题，虽然已经进行了许多考察，今后仍然还要进行整整一系列实验发射，以解决与人在宇宙空间居留的安全及其返回地面有关的许多问题。
    他指出，第二个宇宙飞船历史性的飞行结果，获得了活机体可以在宇宙空间安全飞行及返回地面的证明。第一批宇宙航行者——试验动物、植物和微生物已转交到科学家手中。他们将会说明，为了在不久的将来使人成为宇宙飞船的乘客，还需要做些什么。他强调指出，这就是我们的目的，而这一定会达到的。他说，苏联科学家将向全世界科学家提供在第二个宇宙飞船飞行期间获得的科学考察结果。“和平的苏联科学——仅为和平与人的幸福服务的科学——的崇高目的正在于此。”
    苏联科学院生物学部院士秘书西萨基扬介绍了第二个卫星式宇宙飞船飞行的生物学考察计划。
    西萨基扬说，用宇宙飞船送入宇宙的所有生物体，特点不仅在于种类复杂，而且还在于对宇宙环境各种因素具有不同程度的反应。
    西萨基扬接着谈到了在第二个卫星式飞船发射前提出的基本任务。占首要地位的是研究机体在宇宙飞行条件下生命活动特点的问题。特别是研究了飞行主要因素——超重、失重状态、加速作用的生物学影响。在从遗传学观点研究宇宙飞行条件对机体的影响方面也受到很大注意。
    医学科学院院士帕林说，准备动物从事宇宙飞行的生物学家和医学家们，努力完全利用卫星式飞船上提供给他们进行试验的空间。由于这些努力的结果，动物容器就成了一个符合二十世纪科学要求的现代化“诺亚方舟”的模型。
    在这只独特的“方舟”上的栖居者中有狗，狗是考察者的标准对象。它在研究解决宇宙飞行对极重要的生理系统的影响这个最重要的问题方面，是最合适的试验动物。第一：狗的血液循环、呼吸在外部环境条件变化时的反应，一般说来，相当接近于人在类似条件下的反应；第二：狗可以很好地习惯于长期试验条件，易于进行繁多的医学检查。在这方面，甚至与人类似的猴子也比不上狗，尽管它们按照进化发展来看与人更相近。
    著名的物理学家维尔诺夫向记者们介绍了飞船在飞行中所进行的关于宇宙辐射的大量考察工作。他说，只有地球—宇宙—地球飞行，才可能获得这种辐射的照片。
    在第二个飞船上还有用于研究原始宇宙辐射原子核的照相乳胶仪器。这样的试验只有在能保证返回地面的宇宙飞船上进行。
    什克洛夫斯基教授说，在第二个宇宙飞船飞行期间获得了太阳发出的短波辐射的新资料。
    接着，由记者们提问。有一个问题提到，艾森豪威尔说，美国在考察宇宙方面走在世界一切国家之前。托普切夫答复说，现在全世界都可以看到，苏联在这方面是走在前面的。带动物的容器降回地面，是人飞入宇宙的直接先声。
    一位记者引述了英国一位科学家的话说，苏联可以在任何时候把人送入宇宙，可能在最近几月内。托普切夫回答说，苏联科学家们认为，在这方面还需要进一步实验改进宇宙飞船的一切系统，一直到能够肯定人的飞行和返回是完全安全为止。
    托普切夫指出，奥地利一家报纸关于苏联在研究宇宙方面的成就似乎是发展军事工业的附带结果的论点，是荒谬的。这家报纸还说，苏联的成就似乎是由于在战争结束时夺取了纳粹德国的火箭技术中心的结果。托普切夫强调说：许多德国工程师，包括布劳恩在内，都在美国工作，可是美国在这方面的落后却是无可争辩的。
    据新华社24日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联一些科学家近两天发表谈话和文章，谈到了苏联第二个宇宙飞船的自动控制和无线电装置。
    苏联科学院院士阿姆巴楚米扬24日在苏联“真理报”上发表文章说，苏联宇宙飞船从运行轨道上降落，是根据苏联科学家在预先选定的时刻从地面发出的指令，飞船降落的地点也是预先就选好的。这一点十分重要。这证明，非常完善的控制机构工作得完善无缺，在发展遥控设备方面已经获得了巨大的进展，还证明全部自动设备工作得非常良好。苏联科学技术的新胜利是实现人到达别的行星和它们的卫星上的重要的一步。
    苏联无线电电子学专家皮斯托尔科尔斯着重指出，无线电电子学装备在宇宙飞船整个实验过程中起了极重要的作用。飞船返回地面的制动装置和操纵系统的工作都是通过这种装置实现的。在飞行期间，利用这种装置实现了飞船同地面三条通路的工作：遥测通路、在宇宙无线电通信实践中第一次运用的电视通路、遥控通路。
    另一位无线电电子学专家维诺格拉多夫在“劳动报”上撰文说，飞船上安装的电视发射管质量是很高的。他还指出，装在飞船上的，实际上是一个拥有全套发射活动电视影像的装备的小电视中心。
    他说，这次从宇宙发送电视成功，证实苏联科学家关于在最近的将来利用卫星向地面广大地区发送电视的可能性。这样，电视接收范围就将大大扩大。
