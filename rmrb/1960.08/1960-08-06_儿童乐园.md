    One Saturday afternoon, the temperature exceeded 37 degrees Celsius. The childcare workers of the Minkang Kindergarten in the Fangsheng People's Commune, as usual, were busily working up a sweat to make the children comfortable. Yu Chunfang, a caregiver in the junior class, came up with a local method to lower the indoor temperature. She moved in a large basin of cool water and coaxed the children to drink the heat-prevention drinks that changed daily: "Good kids, radish water is delicious, cool and sweet, and it prevents illness." In other areas, the teachers of the senior class were telling stories about water that could make people feel cool, calming the children down. After finishing lunch, cook Meng Weiqing prepared dinner in advance and let it cool. The health worker was carefully checking the disinfection of the children's utensils.
    In the evening, the kindergarten director, Liang Hanyu, returned from a meeting in the commune and, upon entering, suggested a good way to cool down: open the back windows and make fans. "Great! This will be good for the children." The director's proposal was immediately approved by everyone, and they immediately started working on it. By the afternoon of the next day, a total of twelve homemade fans had been installed in the rooms of each class, some made of paper, some of plywood, some hand-pulled, and some foot-pedaled. Rooms that originally had no back windows had back windows opened. From then on, the children enjoyed the cool breeze provided by the childcare workers while eating, sleeping, and resting.
    The diligent work of the childcare workers enabled the more than two hundred children in the kindergarten to spend the hot summer days comfortably, with indoor temperatures generally below 30 degrees Celsius. Since the beginning of the year, not a single child in the entire kindergarten has had diarrhea. Except for individual day-care children, none have developed prickly heat.

    儿童乐园
    一个星期六的下午，气温超过了三十七度。丰盛人民公社民康幼儿园的保教人员，为使孩子们过得舒服，照例满头大汗地忙碌着。小班的保育员于春芳，一会儿想出一个使室内温度降低的土办法，搬进去一大盆凉水，一会儿又哄着孩子多喝天天变花样的防暑饮料：“乖乖，萝卜水好喝，又凉又甜，喝了不生病。”在其他一些场所，大班的教养员正在讲着能够使人感到凉爽的水的故事，使孩子们安静下来。炊事员孟维清吃完中午饭，就把晚饭做好凉着了。保健员正在仔细地检查孩子们食具消毒的情况。
    傍晚，园长梁汉玉从公社开会回来，一进门就向大家提出一个降温的好办法：开后窗，做风扇。“好啊！这下子孩子们可好了。”园长的提议立即得到大家的赞成，并且立即动手干起来了。到第二天下午，各个班的屋子共装起了十二个土风扇，有纸做的，有三合板做的，有手拉的，脚蹬的。原来没有后窗的屋子，都开了后窗。从此，孩子们在吃饭、睡觉、休息的时候，都会享受到保教人员送给他们的凉风。
    保教人员辛勤的劳动，使这个园二百多个孩子，舒适地过着炎热的大伏天，室内的温度一般都在三十度以下。今年以来，全园还没有一个孩子泻肚的。除了个别日托的孩子，也没有生痱子的。
