I am a man of peasant origin who also worked as a handicraft worker and only had four months of schooling. In over thirty years of revolutionary struggle, although I have learned some culture, it is still far from enough, and I am a complete outsider when it comes to literary work. I remember when I was young, one spring, my family suffered a famine. We couldn't borrow or beg for food, and my family of several people survived solely on wild vegetables. The local primary school was looking for a cook, so I asked an old gentleman named Guo Shuzhen to help me get introduced to the school to handle the meals. I handled the meals fairly, not skimming a single copper coin from the oil, and the meals were so well-managed that the teachers and students were all beaming with oil on their faces, giving me thumbs up. Therefore, the school elected me as a school board member. A landlord named Li Longji, upon hearing that I had become a school board member, acted as if someone had dug up his ancestral grave, shouting everywhere, "To have such a pauper as a school board member is a disgrace to the academic community!" Other landlords and gentry followed suit, clamoring to remove me from the school. Fortunately, old gentleman Guo Shuzhen was what the old society called an upright person, and he supported me, so I wasn't fired. In the old society, someone like me, "poor and blank," was considered a disgrace to the academic community even to manage meals in a school. How could I have a place in the cultural world? This matter happened more than thirty years ago. Today, more than thirty years later, things have fundamentally changed, and even someone like me, who came from illiteracy, can attend the Literary and Art Congress after being nurtured and educated by the Party. How can I not be happy about this!

These thirty years have been an earth-shaking era in China, an era in which the Chinese people have transformed from slaves into masters, and our country has transformed from a semi-colonial state into an oriental giant. However, the victory was not easy to achieve. Many revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their most precious lives for the cause of the Party, and many revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses persevered in a cruel struggle against the enemy under extremely difficult conditions. Without the past, there would be no present. Without the heroic struggles of the revolutionary martyrs who fell one after another, the victory of the revolution would be unimaginable.

The victory of the Chinese revolution is the victory of Marxism-Leninism, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the victory of Comrade Mao Zedong's creative application of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. The facts of the struggle over the past thirty years prove that no victory has been achieved without the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and no victory has not shone with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. Without the wise leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the victory of the revolution would be even more unimaginable.

It is our responsibility to promote the fearless spirit of the revolutionary martyrs and spread Mao Zedong Thought. We must make today's masses understand the arduousness of the revolutionary struggle in the past and cherish the fruits of today's victory. We must use historical facts to prove to today's masses the brilliance of the Party's leadership and the correctness of Mao Zedong Thought, and encourage them to strengthen their study of Chairman Mao's works and apply Mao Zedong Thought to all specific work in order to accelerate socialist construction. I am telling revolutionary stories and writing memoirs of revolutionary struggles in this spirit, because this is an excellent means of conducting revolutionary tradition education for today's masses.

I love to tell revolutionary stories to the masses, especially young people, and I wanted to write memoirs of revolutionary struggles, not because I realized its importance from the beginning, but because I gradually clarified it through practice. I first discovered the role of telling revolutionary stories in inspiring young people's revolutionary enthusiasm in 1930. At that time, I was working in Liuyang, Hunan, and the Party sent me to lead more than twenty young men and women to carry out activities in the enemy's rear in northeastern Liuyang. Because the road was cut off by the enemy, we had to detour through the high mountains bordering Hunan and Jiangxi. It was winter, and the mountains were covered with several feet of snow. The bamboo was pressed low to the ground, and there was no one to be seen on the mountains, not even a sparrow flying. We walked high and low in the deep mountain snow, and we fell into the snow pits if we were not careful. The wind scraped our faces like a knife. At night, we found a broken house that had been burned by the enemy and squeezed together to sleep. We used broken pottery shards smashed by the enemy to cook rice. No one knew whether the jar was a water jar or a urine jar. When we got up in the morning, our bodies and hair were covered with icicles. In short, it was quite difficult. Those young men and women had not undergone much training. They were full of energy before they set off, but at this time their thoughts began to waver. The younger ones, fifteen or sixteen years old, even started to cry. In order to make them forget their fatigue and forget the current difficulties, I told them stories, stories about the difficulties I had encountered in my past revolutionary work, and stories about the heroic and tenacious struggle of revolutionary comrades. For more than ten days, I kept telling stories, while walking and while resting. At first, I only saw that they were very happy to listen, and I did not expect that their thoughts would change after listening to the stories. They became brave and strong, and they didn't put difficulties in their eyes. This made me realize that telling revolutionary stories is also the best means of conducting political and ideological education. Later, I often used it to promote struggle and work. After liberation, I told many revolutionary stories to comrades in factories, agencies, schools, and troops. In the summer of 1956, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting in Lushan, calling on veteran cadres to write memoirs of revolutionary struggles to conduct revolutionary tradition education for the people of the province, so as to carry forward the revolutionary tradition of the Jiangxi people and strive for greater glory. The Provincial Committee also sent comrades such as Hu Kuang to help me record and organize. With the encouragement and specific help of the Provincial Committee, over the years, more than ten articles such as "Adventures in the Mountains," "Pan Hu," "A Short and Glorious Life," "At the Time of the Failure of the Great Revolution," "An Armed Transportation Team," and "Exile" have been compiled one after another. After these works were published, they received letters from workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and agency cadres, who all expressed that they had benefited from the works. This was a great encouragement to me. From those letters, I learned how eager they were for more and better memoirs of revolutionary struggles! I think that as long as our many veteran revolutionary comrades take action, more and better memoirs of revolutionary struggles will surely appear in the future.

Below, I would like to talk about some of my personal experiences on several issues encountered when writing memoirs of revolutionary struggles.

The first is the issue of authenticity. Memoirs of revolutionary struggles are real people and events in the revolutionary struggle, and no fictional plots are allowed. Fictionalization is disloyal to history and disloyal to the Party, which will distort history, and there is no point in using historical stories to educate the masses. However, we must have a correct understanding of authenticity, and we cannot think that recording a detailed account is the truth of history. On the contrary, our requirement for historical truth does not require recording every detail of the past struggle life, but rather to grasp the pulse of history and the characteristics of the times, and choose representative and typical things to write about. Only such works can have universal significance, can truly reflect the face of history, and have the positive effect of inspiring and exciting people. I wrote "Pan Hu" based on this understanding.

"Pan Hu" is a typical figure in the peasant revolutionary movement. I am very familiar with this type of figure. I am familiar with them not only because I myself am of peasant origin and have been working among the peasant masses since I joined the revolution, but also because I participated in the peasant riot as early as 1906. That year was a year of great famine, and the peasants had no food to eat. Zhang Xiaozhong, a peasant leader in Xixiang, Liuyang, led the peasants to riot and set fire to a small town called Zhenchong. However, they had no ideology, no tactics, and no strict organization. They rose up in a swarm, and as a result, they were wiped out by the Qing Dynasty army in less than three days. Zhang Xiaozhong was caught, his head was cut off and hung on a tree to "warn the public." I was eighteen years old at the time and also participated in this riot. I remember Comrade Xu Teli once said to me: "Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, you Liuyang people have launched countless peasant riots, but they have all failed time and time again. Why? Because there is no leadership from the Party." That's right, without the leadership of the Party, peasant riots will never succeed. Pan Hu is the same type of person as Zhang Xiaozhong. He is straightforward, bold, and resists oppression and exploitation. He hates landlords and urgently demands revolution. However, he has no understanding of revolution, he only knows how to act recklessly. Without the leadership of the Party, he would inevitably follow the same path as Zhang Xiaozhong. However, Pan Hu is lovable. His lovability lies in his recognition of the Chinese Communist Party, in his firm involvement in the proletarian-led revolutionary movement. Therefore, his guerrilla team finally became an organized people's armed force and played its due role in the revolutionary cause. From this, we can understand Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts on the worker-peasant alliance, we can recognize Comrade Mao Zedong's theory that red political power can be established in the countryside first, and we can see the inevitable historical development of "a single spark can start a prairie fire" as pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong. I did not write about Pan Hu by chance, but after brewing and selection. Here, we must also mention the issue of artistic processing. Although memoirs of revolutionary struggles must be true, they do not exclude artistic processing. Artistic processing is not the same as fictionalizing stories, but literary works that have been artistically processed can be "higher, stronger, more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal than ordinary actual life, and therefore more universal." Therefore, artistic processing is necessary.

The second is the issue of cooperation between the narrator and the recorder. The quality of cooperation between the narrator and the recorder is directly related to the success or failure of the work, so this is an important issue. Writing memoirs of revolutionary struggles is a serious political task, and it should be treated with high political enthusiasm and a serious and responsible attitude. This is the basic understanding that both the narrator and the recorder should have. However, the narrator and the recorder have different experiences and different political levels, and there will inevitably be some distance in understanding issues and understanding the development of events. Shortening and eliminating this distance requires the efforts of both parties. When narrating, the narrator should provide a comprehensive introduction, and should introduce the political and economic situation, geographical environment, customs and habits, etc. at that time and place. They should also focus on the narration, and should meticulously describe the process of a certain event, the character of a certain person, etc. When I was talking about the experience of being scattered in the Tonggu Mountains, I first introduced the enemy's fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign against our Soviet area, the geographical environment of the Tonggu Mountains, the reasons why I was scattered, and my situation at that time. I also focused on the fundamental reason why I suffered such hardships in the mountains was due to Kong Hechong's reckless policy. If Kong Hechong had implemented the military and political lines of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, it would not have caused the opposition between the red and the white. Then, even if I was scattered, I would have received the support of the masses and would not have been isolated and helpless. I want to record this history in order to express this understanding: without Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution will encounter difficulties or failure. In order to bring the recorder into the environment at that time, I used sounds, actions, and drawings to cooperate with the narration. For example, when narrating the passage where I was "threatened" by frogs in the pond, I drew the terrain of the mountain depression and pond, and made the hiding posture, so that the recorder was as if he was there, and generated the same thoughts and feelings as the narrator, and could use vivid language to describe the scene at that time. In short, we must be patient when narrating, because it is difficult to imagine that the recorder can record and organize something that he has not experienced through one or two narrations. On the other hand, the recorder must also have the energy to not be afraid of trouble. Even if a sentence is not clarified, if it is important, it must be asked repeatedly until it is thoroughly understood, and there should be no impatience or sloppiness. The recorder should immerse his own thoughts and feelings in the historical events at that time, and should deeply understand them in a way that puts himself in the position of the person involved. In this way, the characters written will be vivid, not clay sculptures. The stories narrated will be vivid and moving, not just simple historical records.

In the past, because I saw that telling revolutionary stories had a very good educational effect on the younger generation, I always wanted to write down my own experiences as a material for conducting revolutionary tradition education for young people. I once told this idea to a young comrade and planned to ask him to help me. He said, "What's there to talk about the past? We have to look forward, not backward." After he said this, I gave up the idea. It wasn't that I was convinced by his reasons, but that I had another concern. I thought: if I write these things down, will people say that I am boasting about myself? The Party has always taught us to be humble. Is doing this contrary to the Party's teachings? So for a long time I didn't think about writing, until the Jiangxi Provincial Committee issued a call in 1956, and I started writing.

Are there still veteran revolutionary comrades who have the same concerns that I once had today? If so, I would advise him to quickly dispel them. Revolutionary memoirs are a powerful means of promoting the fearless spirit of revolutionary martyrs and spreading Mao Zedong Thought, and a powerful means of conducting revolutionary tradition education for the younger generation. Through it, today's youth can see intimately: the victory of the Chinese revolution did not come easily. Through it, today's youth can see deeply: Mao Zedong Thought not only was, is, and will always be the most correct guide for revolution and construction. We must never abandon such a powerful means of propaganda and education in order to avoid suspicion for ourselves. Our veteran revolutionary comrades are generally quite old. If we don't hurry up and write it out, many historically significant events may be submerged. So I urge veteran revolutionary comrades to write revolutionary memoirs. If you are limited by time, energy, or other conditions and cannot write it yourself, please ask comrades in the literary and art circles for help. I also urge comrades in the literary and art circles to give full attention to this matter and allocate capable cadres to help veteran revolutionary comrades. In short, whether it is veteran revolutionary comrades or comrades in the literary and art circles, we must all take action and use literary forms to write down the Party's glorious history, so as to educate today's masses and inspire today's masses, so as to give full play to their enthusiasm for building socialism and communism.

    用文艺形式写出党的光辉历史来	邓洪
    我是一个农民出身的人，也做过手工业工人，只读过四个月的书。在三十多年的革命斗争中，虽然学过一些文化，毕竟很不够，对文艺工作更是道道地地的外行。记得我年轻时候，有一年春天，家里闹饥荒，借也借不到，讨也没处讨，一家几口单靠野菜过日子。当地有个小学正要找一个伙伕，我就请一位叫郭树真的老先生帮忙，把我介绍到小学里去办伙食。我办伙食很公道，一个铜板的油都不揩，伙食办得好，老师学生一个一个吃得油光满面，都向我翘大拇指，因此学校推举我当校董。有个地主叫李隆吉，听说我当校董，好像挖了他家的祖坟一样，到处叫喊：“要这么个穷光蛋来当校董，真失了学界的格。”别的地主、绅士也跟着吵吵叫叫，要把我从学校撵走。好在郭树真老先生是个旧社会所说的正派人，他支持我，才算没给搞掉饭碗。在旧社会像我这样“一穷二白”的人，连到学校里去管伙食都失了学界的格，文化界又怎能有我插脚的余地呢？这事已经过去三十多年了。三十多年后的今天，事情起了根本的变化，连我这文盲出身的人，经过党的培养教育，也能出席文代大会了。这怎能不叫我高兴呢！
    这三十多年，在我们中国是个翻天复地的年代，是中国人民由奴隶变为主人的年代，是我们的国家由半殖民地变为东方巨人的年代。但是，胜利的取得并不是容易的，多少革命先烈为了党的事业献出了自己最宝贵的生命，多少革命干部和革命群众，在极端艰苦的条件下，坚持与敌人进行过残酷的斗争。没有过去，就没有今天，没有革命先烈前仆后继的英勇搏斗，革命的胜利是不可想像的。
    中国革命的胜利是马克思列宁主义的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是毛泽东同志把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，创造性地运用于中国革命的具体实践的胜利。三十多年的斗争事实证明：没有任何一次胜利不是在毛泽东思想的指引下取得的，没有任何一次胜利不闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。如果没有党和毛泽东同志的英明领导，革命的胜利更是不可想像的。
    宣扬革命先烈的大无畏精神，传播毛泽东思想，是我们的责任。我们必须使今天的群众了解过去革命斗争的艰苦，珍惜今天的胜利果实；我们必须通过历史事实向今天的群众证明党的领导的英明，证明毛泽东思想的正确，鼓舞他们加强学习毛主席著作，并将毛泽东思想运用到各项具体工作中去，以加速社会主义建设。我就是本着这一精神讲革命故事、写革命斗争回忆录的，因为这是向今天的群众进行革命传统教育的极好手段。
    我爱向群众特别是青少年讲革命故事，想写革命斗争回忆录，也不是一开始就意识到它的重要性的，而是通过实践才慢慢明确起来的。我第一次发现讲革命故事有鼓舞青年革命热情的作用是在1930年。那时我在湖南浏阳工作，党派我带二十多个小伙子和小姑娘到浏阳东北敌后去活动。因为道路被敌人截断了，我们只好绕道从湖南、江西交界的高山上走。那是冬天，山上堆着几尺深的雪，竹子都被压得低到地上了，满山上看不见一个人，甚至看不见一个雀子飞。我们就在深山雪地里高一脚低一脚走，一不小心就跌到雪坑里去，风在脸上像刀一样地刮，晚上找一个被敌人烧剩的破屋挤着一块睡，拿敌人打碎的破缸片煮饭，那缸究竟是水缸还是尿缸，谁也不知道，早上起来身上头发上都结着冰凌。总之，那是相当艰苦的。那些小伙子小姑娘都是没有经过多少锻炼的，动身以前劲头十足，到这时候思想就波动起来了，年龄小的，十五、六岁的，甚至哭起鼻子来。为了使他们忘却疲劳，忘却当前的艰苦，我就给他们讲故事，讲我自己过去在革命工作中遭受的困难，讲革命同志在斗争中的英勇顽强。十多天中，我一直讲，走路的时候也讲，休息的时候也讲。当初我只看到他们听起来很高兴，没有料想到他们听了故事之后，思想也起了变化。他们勇敢起来了，坚强起来了，把困难不放在眼睛里头了。这才使我意识到讲革命故事也是进行政治思想教育的最好手段。后来我就经常利用它推动斗争和工作。解放以后，我曾对工厂、机关、学校、部队的同志们讲过不少的革命故事。1956年夏天，中共江西省委在庐山开会，号召老干部写革命斗争回忆录，向全省人民进行革命传统教育，以发扬江西人民的革命传统，争取更大光荣。省委并派胡旷等同志来帮助我记录整理。在省委的鼓励和具体帮助下，几年来陆续整理出了《山中历险记》、《潘虎》、《短促而光辉的生命》、《在大革命失败的时候》、《一支武装交通队》、《流亡》等十余篇。这些作品发表以后，曾先后收到了工人、农民、士兵、学生和机关干部的来信，他们都表示从作品中得到了教益。这对我是个很大的鼓励。从那些来信中使我知道他们是多么渴望更多、更好的革命斗争回忆录啊！我想只要我们众多的老革命同志都动起手来，今后一定会出现更多更好的革命斗争回忆录的。
    下面我想就写革命斗争回忆录时所遇到的几个问题谈一点个人的体会。
    首先是真实性问题。革命斗争回忆录是革命斗争中实有的人物和事件，不容许虚构故事情节；虚构就是对历史不忠实、对党不忠实，就会歪曲历史，就谈不上用历史故事教育群众了。但是，我们必定要对真实性有正确的理解，不能认为记下一笔流水账就是历史的真实。恰恰相反，我们要求历史的真实并不需要将过去斗争生活中的点滴事情都记录下来，而是要把握历史的脉搏、时代的特征，选择有代表性的、有典型意义的东西写。这样的作品才能带普遍意义，才能真实地反映历史面貌，才有鼓舞人激动人的积极作用。我写《潘虎》就是根据这个认识的。
    《潘虎》是农民革命运动的典型人物。这类人物是我非常熟悉的。我熟悉他们，不单是因为我自己是农民出身，参加革命后又一直在农民群众里面做工作，而且是因为早在1906年我就参加过农民暴动。那年是大饥荒的年成，农民都没有饭吃。浏阳西乡有个农民领袖叫张晓忠，领导农民起来暴动，把一个叫振冲的小市镇放火烧掉了。但是他们没有主义，没有策略，也没有严密的组织，一哄而起，结果，不到三天，就被清朝的军队消灭了。张晓忠被抓住，脑袋被砍下挂在树上“示众”。我当时十八岁也参加了这次暴动。记得徐特立同志曾经对我这样讲过：“清末以来，你们浏阳不知道发动过多少次农民暴动，但是一次一次都失败了。为什么？因为没有党的领导。”一点不错，没有党的领导，农民暴动是始终不得成功的。潘虎是跟张晓忠同类的人物，他直爽、粗犷，他反抗压迫、剥削；他仇恨地主，他迫切要求革命，但是，他对革命没有认识，他只晓得蛮干，如果没有党的领导，他必然会走上张晓忠那条道路，但是，潘虎是可爱的。他的可爱，在于他认识了中国共产党，在于他坚决投入无产阶级领导的革命运动，因此，他那支游击队终于成了一支有组织的人民武装，在革命事业中，起了应有的作用。从这里我们可以理解毛泽东同志关于工农联盟的思想，可以认识毛泽东同志关于红色政权可以首先在农村建立起来的理论，可以看到毛泽东同志指出的“星星之火，可以燎原”的历史发展必然性。我写潘虎不是偶然的，是经过酝酿和选择的。在这里，还必须提到艺术加工的问题。革命斗争回忆录虽然必须真实，但并不排斥艺术加工。艺术加工并不等于虚构故事，而经过艺术加工的文学作品就能“比普通的实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此就更带普遍性”。所以艺术加工是必要的。
    其次是口述者和记录整理者的合作问题。口述者和记录整理者合作的好坏，直接关系到作品的成败，所以这是个重要的问题。写革命斗争回忆录是一个严肃的政治任务，应该以高度的政治热情和严肃、认真负责的态度对待它，这是口述者和记录整理者都应具备的基本认识。但口述者和记录整理者的经历不同，政治水平不一，在认识问题、了解事件发展上不免有些距离，要拉短并消灭这种距离是要经过双方努力的。讲述者在讲述时，要有全面的介绍，对当时、当地的政治、经济情况、地理环境、风俗习惯等等都要介绍清楚；也要有重点地讲述，对某一事件的经过，某个人物的性格等等都要细致地描绘。我在讲铜鼓山中被冲散的那段经历时，首先介绍了敌人对我苏区进行第五次“围剿”的情况，铜鼓山中的地理环境，我被冲散的原因和当时的处境，并着重讲述了我在山中遭受那种苦难的根本原因乃是由于孔贺宠的盲动政策所致。如果孔贺宠执行了党中央和毛主席的军事路线和政治路线，就不会造成赤白对立。那么，我即使被冲散，也会得到群众的支持而不至于孤立无援。我要记下这段历史，就是为了要表现这个认识：离开了毛泽东思想，革命就会遭到困难或失败。为了把记录整理者带到当时的环境中去，我曾以声音、动作和画图等等来配合讲述。例如讲述我在水塘内遭青蛙“威胁”那一段时，我就画出了那山洼、水塘的地形，作出了躲藏的姿势，这样记录整理者就如同身历其境，产生与讲述者同样的思想感情，能用形象的语言描绘出当时的情景了。总之，我们讲述时要有耐心，因为记录整理者没有经历过的事，要想通过一两次的讲述就能记录整理出来，也是难以想像的。另一方面，记录整理者也要有不怕麻烦的劲头，那怕是一句话没有搞清楚，如果关系重要，就必须重复问，直到透彻理解为止，不应该有半点急躁和草率。记录整理者要把自己的思想感情沉浸到当时的历史事件中去，要设身处地深入体会，这样写出来的人物就会活灵活现，而不是泥塑木雕像；所叙述的故事，就会生动感人，而不只是单纯的历史记载。
    以前我因为看见讲革命故事对年青一代有很好的教育作用，所以总想把自己的经历写出来，作为一份向青年进行革命传统教育的材料。我曾经把这个意思向一位年青的同志讲过，打算要他帮我的忙。他说：“过去的事有什么谈的？我们要向前看，不要向后看。”经他这一说，我的念头就打消了。倒不是给他的理由说服了，而是我产生了另外一个顾虑。我想：我把这些东西写出来，人家是不是会说我吹嘘自己呢？党一向教导我们要谦虚，这样做是不是违背党的教导呢？于是很长一段时期我没有想到要写，直到1956年江西省委发出号召，我才写起来。
    今天是不是还有老革命同志有着我曾经有过的那种顾虑呢？如果有，我就劝他赶快打消。革命回忆录是宣扬革命先烈的大无畏精神、传播毛泽东思想的有力手段，是向青年一代进行革命传统教育的有力手段。通过它可以使今天的青年亲切地看到：中国革命胜利来之不易；通过它可以使今天的青年深刻地看到：毛泽东思想不仅过去是、现在是、而且将来永远是革命和建设的最正确的指针。我们决不能为了自己避免嫌疑而放弃这样一个有力的宣传教育手段。我们老革命同志一般年龄都相当老了，如果不抓紧写出来，许多意义重大的历史事件就有可能湮没下去。所以我劝老革命同志大家来写革命回忆录。如果限于时间、精力或其他条件不能自己写，就请文艺界的同志帮忙。我也劝文艺界的同志对这件事给以充分的注意，分配有力的干部给老革命同志帮忙。总之，老革命同志也好，文艺界的同志也好，我们大家都要动起手来，用文艺的形式，把党的光辉历史写下来，用以教育今天的群众，鼓舞今天的群众，为建设社会主义、共产主义而发挥高度的积极性。
