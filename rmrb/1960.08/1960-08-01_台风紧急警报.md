Eat, Live, and Labor Together with Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, Paint Works Welcome by Workers, Peasants and Soldiers: China's Fine Arts Creation is Full of Revolutionary Spirit
    Xinhua News Agency, July 31st. On the wall at the entrance of the banquet hall in the Great Hall of the People hangs a huge landscape painting. From the picture, a rising sun bursts forth, illuminating the nearby mountains, ancient pines, rivers, and plains, appearing majestic and graceful; reflecting the distant sea of clouds and snow-capped mountains, vast and boundless, truly making people feel "clad in silver, adorned in red, especially enchanting." People exclaim from the bottom of their hearts: How can such a beautiful country not inspire countless heroes to bend their backs!
    Countless such art works, beloved by the people, have emerged in the vibrant art garden of the motherland since the founding of the country, especially since the Great Leap Forward. Take this National Art Exhibition as an example, those works with a high degree of ideological and artistic quality, whether from its creative themes, artistic forms and the style of the works, all show the revolutionary spirit and national style that China's fine arts possess in this great era.
    In the past two years, most art workers have selected the themes of praising the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, expressing the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, as well as the class struggle and the struggle to conquer nature, etc., taking the working people as the protagonists in the paintings. Through ingenious artistic conception and skilled techniques, they have created many excellent works. Whether in traditional Chinese painting, oil painting, printmaking, cartoons, propaganda posters, New Year pictures, paper-cuts, and sculptures, works expressing such themes are everywhere.
    In recent years, under the call of the Party, many artists have left their studios and gone to the mountains and countryside and the grassroots units of the army. By eating, living, and laboring together with workers, peasants, and soldiers, they have constantly transformed their own thoughts and feelings, and created paintings that praise workers, peasants, and soldiers. These works are deeply welcomed by the people. This spring, the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore selected a batch of wonderful New Year pictures to exhibit in the suburban rural areas, reservoirs, and temple fairs. People came in batches to see the paintings, and one old lady was so absorbed that she forgot to eat. Her family barely managed to call her away, but after eating, she came back to watch again, carefully admiring until dark. They especially liked works such as "Doing Good Deeds for Commune Members," "Chairman Mao Comes to My Home," and "Riding the Wind and Waves, Each Showing Their Unique Talents." Female workers from a street factory in Dongcheng District, Beijing, praised the paintings reflecting the theme of the Great Leap Forward after visiting the Beijing "March 8th" Art Exhibition. One viewer said: Seeing that the commune's pigs are raised so well, I think that our production cannot lag behind.
    Under the direction of art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialism, and under the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and bringing forth the new, various genres and forms of art works blossom in the east wind, competing for brilliance.
    Arts and crafts, which embody the lifelong efforts of many veteran artists, are now even more prosperous. Artists have a guaranteed life, and there are many creative themes. Many new contents and new styles of works are emerging in large numbers, and they are well received both at home and abroad.
    Our artists are not only good at absorbing the essence from the traditions of Chinese painting art to develop and use it to reflect modern themes, but also good at absorbing the techniques of foreign art creation, making it Chinese, to express the real struggles and lives of the Chinese people.
    A question that has been discussed for a long time—how to use traditional Chinese painting techniques to express the themes of the times—has now been applied more skillfully. For example, in a group of traditional Chinese paintings depicting urban people's communes that people appreciate, "A Flower in the People's Commune" collectively created by Li Wan and others does not use many figures and objects to write about large scenes, but instead uses the changes of a street, through the depiction of the environment and characters, to very naturally and harmoniously express the superiority of the urban people's commune. In the picture, a group of lively "Young Pioneers" go to school, passing by the gate of the home for the elderly, curiously looking inside and greeting the old grandfather who is concentrating on watering flowers; a female postman is delivering newspapers and magazines to the commune; a team of new female workers go to work, and some of them look back and smile at the babies in the nursery. The author uses the technique of "less is more", through various touching plots, to create a picture praising the socialist family.
    Many young and old painters have made gratifying efforts to use oil paintings, which were introduced from abroad and are still relatively young in China, to express the current reality of China. The oil painting "Road to Happiness," which has been praised by many people, makes people like its "poetry in painting" at first glance. It makes people follow the line of sight of the two Tibetan girls sitting and standing in the painting, seeing the winding road on the mountainside and the speeding cars, arousing a kind of emotion of reminiscing about the past and thinking about the present. Such a comparison naturally makes people feel the greatness of the Party and the happiness brought by socialist construction to the minority peoples. "Evening" by Mongolian author Guan Bu and "Threshing Ground" by Uyghur author Hazi Ai. Luoti are both good at integrating the artistic colors of their own ethnic groups into the picture, making people truly feel the rich life of the ethnic minorities in the border areas today.
    More than 20 years ago, Chairman Mao called on literary and art workers to create works "fresh, lively, and loved by the Chinese people, with Chinese style and Chinese spirit." Today, many artists have made great achievements under the teachings of the Party. However, the noblest ideals of mankind, the rich themes that can never be fully painted, are constantly encouraging the gardeners of art to wave their pens and move forward.

    台风紧急警报
    新华社31日讯　中央气象科学研究所31日中午十二时发布台风紧急警报：
    太平洋上的1960年第七号台风，今天早晨二时中心位置在台湾的台东以东三百公里左右的洋面上，就是北纬二十二点九度，东经一百二十三点九度附近。中心附近最大风力有十二级。目前，台风中心正以每小时七—九浬的速度向西北方向移动。预计未来台风中心将穿过台湾，于明天白天在福建沿海一带登陆。受台风影响，未来三十六小时内，东海南部、台湾海峡的风力将逐渐加强到九—十一级；福建沿海的风力将加强到八—十级，其中登陆地点附近将有十一—十二级大风；浙江和广东东部沿海的风力将加强到六—八级；福建内陆也将有五—七级的大风。台风登陆前后浙江南部、福建、江西东南部将有暴雨。同工农兵同吃同住同劳动　画工农兵喜闻乐见的作品我国美术创作充满革命气派
      据新华社31日讯　在人民大会堂宴会厅入口处的墙壁上，悬挂着一幅巨大的山水画。从画面上看去，一轮旭日，喷薄而出，照耀着近处的高山、苍松、江水与平原，显得雄伟多姿；映得远处的云海、雪山，浩瀚无边，真使人感到“红装素裹，分外妖娆”。人们从心底发出赞叹：如此多娇的大好河山，怎能不令无数英雄为之折腰！
    像这样受到人民所喜爱的美术作品，从建国以来，特别是大跃进以来，在祖国万紫千红的美术园地里，是不计其数的。就拿这次全国美术展览会来说，那些具有高度的思想性和艺术性的作品，无论从它的创作主题、艺术形式和作品的风格上，都显示了我国美术在这伟大时代所具有的革命气魄和民族风格。
    这两年多来，大多数美术工作者，选用了歌颂总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，表现技术革新和技术革命运动，以及阶级斗争和征服自然的斗争等等题材，把劳动人民作为画中的主人公，通过巧妙的艺术构思和熟练的技巧，创造出许多佳作。不论是在国画、油画、版画、漫画、宣传画、年画、剪纸和雕塑中，表达这样主题的作品比比皆是。
    这几年来许多美术家在党的号召下，走出画室，上山下乡下连队，他们通过和工农兵同吃同住同劳动，不断改造自己的思想感情，创作出以工农兵为歌颂对象的画。这些作品，深受人民欢迎。今年春天，北京新华书店挑选了一批精彩年画去郊区农村、水库和庙会展览，看画的人一批一批络绎不绝，有位老大娘看得忘记了吃饭，家里人好容易把她叫走，可是吃过饭她又来看了，一直细细地观赏到天黑。他们特别喜欢“给社员办喜事”、“毛主席来到我家”和“乘风破浪，各显神通”等作品。北京东城区某街道工厂的女工参观北京“三八”美术展览会后，一致称颂那些反映大跃进主题的画。有一位观众说：看到公社的猪养得那么好，就想到咱们生产也不能落后。
    在艺术为工农兵服务为社会主义服务的方向下，在党的百花齐放、推陈出新的方针下，各种体裁、形式的美术作品迎东风而盛开，争放异彩。
    凝聚着多少老艺人毕生心血的工艺美术，如今更是一片繁荣。艺人生活有了保障，创作主题繁多，许多新内容、新风格的作品在大量涌现，在国内外都受到好评。
    我们的美术家不但善于从中国的绘画艺术传统中吸取精华加以发展，用来反映现代题材，而且也善于吸取外国美术创作的技巧，使它中国化，来表现我国人民现实的斗争和生活。
    一个曾经讨论很久的问题——怎样用中国传统的画技来表现时代主题，现在已经运用得比较熟练了。例如人们所欣赏的一批描绘城市人民公社的国画中，李琬等集体创作的“人民公社一枝花”，不用繁多的人物、景物写大场面的手法，而是借一条街的变化，通过对环境、人物的刻划，非常自然和谐地表现出城市人民公社的优越性。画面上一群活泼的“红领巾”去上学，经过敬老院门口，好奇地向里面探望，同正在专心浇花的老爷爷打招呼；迎面又是女邮递员给公社送来书报；一队新女工去上工，其中有几个向着托儿所的娃娃们回顾而笑。作者用“以少胜多”的手法，通过种种动人情节，构成一幅歌颂社会主义大家庭的图画。
    许多年青和年老的画家运用从外国传来的目前在中国还较年轻的油画，来表现中国当前的现实，曾经作了可喜的努力。受到许多人称赞的“幸福之路”这幅油画，使人看了第一眼，就喜欢它的“画中有诗”的情趣。它使人随着画中一站一坐的两个藏族姑娘的视线，看到蜿蜒在山腰的公路和奔驰的汽车，引起一种抚今追昔的思绪，这样的对比很自然地令人感到党的伟大，社会主义建设给少数民族人民带来的幸福。蒙族作者官布的“傍晚”，维吾尔族作者哈孜艾·罗提的“扬场”，都善于使本民族的艺术色彩融入画面，令人真切地感受到今日边疆少数民族的丰富生活。
    二十多年前，毛主席号召文艺工作者创作出“新鲜活泼的、为中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的中国作风和中国气派”的作品来。今天许多美术家在党的教导下已经做出了不小的成绩。但是，人类最崇高的理想，是永远也画不完的丰富的主题，它策励着美术园丁们不停地挥笔前进。
