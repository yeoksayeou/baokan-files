Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 19th: Workers on the Shaanxi transportation front are continuing to launch a large-scale "10,000, 1,000, 300" competition to ensure better completion of key materials transportation tasks. The specific content of the "10,000, 1,000, 300" competition is: freight trucks achieving 10,000 ton-kilometers per month, horse-drawn carts achieving 1,000 ton-kilometers per month, and human-powered carts achieving 300 ton-kilometers per month.

This competition movement was launched four months ago. To date, freight trucks across the province have consistently achieved the target of 10,000 ton-kilometers per month for four consecutive months. More than 3,800 specialized transportation horse-drawn carts in over thirty regions have achieved the target of 1,000 ton-kilometers per month. Human-powered carts in Baoji, Tongchuan, Xi'an, and Xianyang, as well as transportation teams in several special districts, counties, and communes, have also reached or exceeded the target of 300 ton-kilometers per month.

The development of the "10,000, 1,000, 300" competition movement has further strengthened the coordination and cooperation of various transportation tools, thereby promoting a substantial increase in transportation efficiency. To ensure that trucks can carry more and run more often, short-distance transportation departments in various regions, under the unified leadership of the local transportation headquarters, have established collaborative organizations, implemented a combination of long- and short-distance transportation, and divided labor between specialized and sideline transportation tools. This integrates mountain, river, and land transportation, forming a complete transportation network of trunk lines, branch lines, water transport, and land transport. This not only enables key materials such as ore, coal, and grain to be quickly transported out of the mountains, down the rivers, across the ditches, and over the rivers, allowing for timely collection and distribution, but also allows various transportation tools to achieve the "10,000, 1,000, 300" high-yield targets. Baoji City organized railway, highway, planning, dispatching, consignment, cargo owner, and freight yard units to achieve "one-stop" large-scale collaboration, increasing the mileage utilization rate of specialized transportation horse-drawn carts in the city from the original 60% to over 80%, thereby freeing up a batch of trucks to concentrate on running trunk lines and long distances, ensuring that key materials are not backlogged.

To ensure the better development of the "10,000, 1,000, 300" movement, leading organizations at all levels, from the province to the county, have adopted effective measures to strengthen leadership. Party committees and county committees at all levels have implemented a system of division of labor and contracted responsibility at each level, led by the secretaries, to promote the healthy development of the "10,000, 1,000, 300" movement.

    加强运输组织管理  充分挖掘运输潜力
    陕西运输战线开展“万、千、三”竞赛
    全省货运汽车和三千八百多辆专业运输马车以及许多人力架子车连续四个月达到高产指标
    据新华社西安19日电　陕西交通运输战线职工正在继续大规模开展“万、千、三”竞赛，以保证更好地完成重点物资运输任务。“万、千、三”竞赛的具体内容是：货运汽车月产万吨公里，马车月产千吨公里，架子车月产三百吨公里。
    这个竞赛运动是在四个月以前展开的；到目前为止，全省货运汽车已经连续四个月都达到了月产万吨公里的指标；有三十多个地区的三千八百多辆专业运输马车，达到了月产千吨公里的指标；宝鸡、铜川、西安和咸阳等市和若干专、县、公社运输队的人力架子车，也都达到或超过月产三百吨公里的指标。
      “万、千、三”竞赛运动的开展，更加密切了各种运输工具的配合协作，从而促进了运输效率的大幅度提高。各地短途运输部门，为了保证汽车多拉多跑，在当地运输指挥部的统一领导下，纷纷建立协作机构，实行长短途运输结合，专业、副业运输工具分工，把山川水陆运输连成一体，使干线、支线、水运、陆运组成一个完整的运输网，不仅使矿石、煤炭和粮食等重点物资迅速出山、下川、过沟、渡河，得以及时集散转运，而且各种运输工具都分别实现了“万、千、三”高产指标。宝鸡市组织铁路、公路、计划、调度、托运、货主、货场等单位实现“一条龙”大协作，使全市专业运输马车里程利用率由原来60％提高到80％以上，从而腾出了一批汽车集中跑干线，拉长途，保证了重点物资不积压。
    为保证“万、千、三”运动更好地开展，从省到县各级领导组织，都采取了加强领导的有效措施。各地委、市委和县委都由书记挂帅，层层实行了分工包干负责制，领导“万、千、三”运动健康发展。
