Recently, people across the country have been enthusiastically慰问 (comforting and expressing solicitude to) the People's Liberation Army and families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, and have held various get-together activities with the officers and soldiers of the troops.

In the past few days, all districts and counties in the city have generally inspected the work of preferential treatment, solicited opinions from families of martyrs, disabled soldiers, etc., and helped them solve certain problems in their lives. The Tongxian People's Committee also held a special symposium to solicit opinions from the troops stationed in the area on the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee held receptions on the eve of "August 1st" to慰问 (comfort and express solicitude to) officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Tianjin and families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled soldiers. The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee wrote letters to all officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Guangdong on the 31st, expressing gratitude and慰问 (comfort and solicitude). On the Fujian front, people from all over went to the front lines to慰问 (comfort and express solicitude to) the three services.

In recent days, people from all over have held various forms of get-togethers with the local garrison. On the evening of the 31st, Tianjin held a grand get-together attended by more than 5,000 officers and soldiers of the garrison, militiamen, and people from all walks of life. Provincial and municipal leaders attended the get-together. Cities such as Beijing, Lanzhou, Jinan, and Chengdu also held army-civilian get-togethers on the eve of the festival. Representatives from the Beijing Institute of Geology Militia Division and the Tsinghua University Jinggangshan Militia Regiment also went to the engineering corps leadership on the 30th for a get-together. Chen Shiju, Commander of the Engineering Corps, received them during the get-together. Army-civilian get-together activities in Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan, Liaoning and other provinces are also extraordinarily broad. When a naval unit stationed in Guangdong held a get-together with the local people, they invited those who came to the get-together to watch a motorboat performance and a water polo match. A certain unit on the Fujian front and the local people performed literary programs they had jointly created during the get-together.

At the same time, people everywhere held report meetings and forums to learn from the fine traditions and heroic and tenacious fighting spirit of the People's Liberation Army. At a report meeting held in Haidian District, Beijing, with more than 1,300 people participating, Gao Jiquan, a veteran Red Army soldier and commander of a certain PLA unit, reported on the heroic and tenacious, hard-working and simple deeds of the People's Liberation Army. Heping District in Tianjin has recently held six consecutive report meetings, with an audience of approximately 20,000 people.
