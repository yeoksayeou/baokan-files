Xinhua News Agency, 16th August. To celebrate the 15th anniversary of Korean liberation, the "Construction Photo Exhibition of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea," co-sponsored by the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, opened this morning in Zhongshan Park.

Li Yong-ho, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, diplomatic officials from the embassy, and all the distinguished guests of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association delegation, led by Kim Chong-heng, attended the opening ceremony of the exhibition.

Lao She, Vice-President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, presided over the opening ceremony. Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, spoke at the opening ceremony. He said, "We are delighted to see the Korean people, riding the Chollima, advancing valiantly and confidently on the road of socialism. The Chinese people wholeheartedly congratulate the fraternal Korean people on their greater achievements in socialist construction. The Chinese people firmly support the Korean people's just struggle against imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their country."

Zhang Zhixiang said, "While the political and economic cooperation between our two countries continues to develop, cultural cooperation and cultural exchange are also growing, which plays an important role in promoting mutual understanding and friendly unity between the two peoples. The people of China and Korea will always unite and advance hand in hand in the common struggle to defend world peace and oppose US imperialist aggression, as well as in the common cause of building socialism."

Ambassador Li Yong-ho said in his speech that the exhibition now open is a microcosm of the tremendous and leap-forward construction achievements made by our heroic working class and working people—the Chollima riders who have made unparalleled contributions in the struggle to build socialism—under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government in the post-war period.

Ambassador Li Yong-ho said that we will never forget that the achievement of these great successes is inseparable from the sincere material and spiritual assistance of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and the socialist camp. He said that this exhibition will further strengthen and develop the profound friendship between the people of Korea and China, and will make a significant contribution to the future economic and cultural exchange between the two peoples.

Diplomats and diplomatic officials from socialist countries stationed in China were invited to attend the opening ceremony.

The pictures on display in the exhibition vividly reflect the brilliant achievements made by the Korean people in socialist construction, and especially reflect the great revolutionary spirit and heroic spirit displayed by the heroic Korean people in a series of struggles against US imperialist aggression, defending world peace, restoring and developing the post-war national economy, building socialism, and striving for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
