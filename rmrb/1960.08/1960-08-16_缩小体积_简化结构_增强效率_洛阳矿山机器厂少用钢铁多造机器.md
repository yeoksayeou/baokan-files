    Reducing Volume, Simplifying Structure, Enhancing Efficiency
    Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory Uses Less Steel to Build More Machines

    (Our report) The Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory in Henan Province has launched a factory-wide mass product revolution. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has successfully trial-produced twelve new products and reformed fourteen old products, saving a total of 850 tons of steel. This product revolution has promoted a continuous leap forward in production.

    While advancing towards mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, the factory launched a mass product revolution movement targeting heavy machinery products such as mine hoisting, lifting, mining, and washing equipment. Based on the principles of ease of use and material conservation, they mobilized employees to boldly create, meticulously design, actively develop new products, and reduce the volume, weight, and simplify the structure, of many large machines, and increase efficiency. The factory recently successfully trial-produced a new type of coal washing machine, weighing only 42 tons, half the weight of the old "Linxi-style" coal washing machine. Production efficiency has doubled. It is fully automated, and it has the advantages of easy installation, easy operation, and power saving. The newly trial-produced Gongnong brand small rolling mill, 50-ton crane, and other products have been put into production one after another. Currently, the entire factory's employees are fighting to achieve the goal of increasing production without increasing materials, one ton being as good as two tons, and "increasing production without increasing manpower, one person being as good as two persons."

    Reforming old products is an important part of the factory's product revolution. The old products that have already been put into production are classified and lined up, and each machine and part is checked one by one. Targeting unreasonable components and structures, methods such as "shaving beards," "cutting out appendices," and "major surgery" are adopted to thoroughly reform them. Many old products, after reform, have been "reborn" into unique new products. For example, they changed the complex and difficult-to-manufacture depth indicator on the hoist to a circular dial pointer, creating favorable conditions for use and operation. In reforming old products, the entire factory's employees have carried forward the spirit of continuous revolution and are not satisfied with their existing achievements. For example, the multi-steel wire rope friction wheel hoist, although a product that was only successfully trial-produced at the end of 1958, has now also become the object of product revolution. After joint research and reform by leaders, technicians, and workers, the weight of the three-meter hoist was reduced from 57 tons to 22.5 tons, saving 57% of steel, reducing the number of parts by 50%, and reducing cold processing man-hours by 70%, while greatly improving the lifting speed.

    While carrying out the product revolution, the Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory also mobilized the masses to vigorously promote the standardization, generalization, and serialization of product parts, greatly improving the versatility of old product parts. Through the product revolution and the generalization and serialization of product parts, the factory's hoist production capacity has doubled.

    缩小体积　简化结构　增强效率
    洛阳矿山机器厂少用钢铁多造机器
    本报讯　河南洛阳矿山机器厂发动全厂职工大闹产品革命，今年以来，全厂试制成功了十二种新产品，改革了十四种老产品，共节约钢材八百五十吨。通过产品革命，促进了生产持续跃进。
    这个厂在向机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化进军的同时，就针对矿井提升、起重、采掘、洗选设备等重型机械产品，开展了群众性的产品革命运动。他们根据使用方便，节约材料的原则，发动职工大胆创造、精心设计，积极发展新产品，使许多大型机械的体积由大变小，重量减轻，结构简化，效率提高。这个厂在最近试制成功一种新型洗煤机，体重只有四十二吨，比原来的老产品“林西式”洗煤机重量减轻一半，生产效率却提高一倍，全部是自动化生产，并具有安装方便、容易操作、节约用电等优点。已经试制成功的工农牌小型轧钢机、五十吨天车等产品已陆续投入生产。现在全厂职工正为实现增产不增料，一吨顶两吨，“增产不增人，一人顶两人”的要求而战斗。
    改革老产品，是这个厂大闹产品革命的一项重要内容。把已经投入生产的老产品，进行分类排队，逐台、逐件检查，针对不合理的部件、结构，采取“刮胡子”、“割盲肠”、“大动手术”等办法，进行彻底改革。许多老产品经过改革后，已经“脱胎换骨”，变成了独具风格的新型产品。例如他们把卷扬机上结构复杂、制造困难的深度指示器改成了圆盘指针式，为使用、操作创造了有利条件。在改革老产品中，全厂职工发扬了不断革命的精神，不以既得的成就为满足。如多钢绳磨擦轮式卷扬机，虽然是1958年底才试制成功的产品，可是现在也成了产品革命的对象，经过领导、技术人员、工人共同研究改革后，使三米卷扬机的重量由五十七吨减轻到二十二点五吨，节约钢材57％，全部零件减少了50％，冷加工工时减少了70％而提升速度却大有提高。
    洛阳矿山机器厂在开展产品革命的同时，并发动群众大搞产品部件的标准化、通用化、系列化，使老产品部件的通用性大大提高。通过产品革命和产品部件的通用化、系列化运动，使全厂卷扬机的生产能力提高了一倍。
