United as One
    Currently, early autumn crops have matured or are nearing maturity; early-sown late autumn crops are in their prime growing season, and in southern regions, efforts are being intensified to expand the planting of late autumn crops. The upcoming period is the golden moment to strive for an autumn grain bumper harvest. Therefore, seizing time is seizing grain!
    The Dahu Production Team of Chengguan Commune in Zou County, Shandong Province, seized this moment. They promptly organized manpower to comprehensively inspect crop growth, and simultaneously mobilized commune members to discuss the implementation of the production plan for the preceding seven and a half months and future measures for exceeding production targets. During the discussion, the broad masses of commune members recognized the current production situation, and everyone was full of energy. With energy, and a clear understanding of the "basics" of production, they pooled their wisdom and efforts and found the key to exceeding production targets: dedicating over ninety percent of the labor force to autumn field management, focusing primarily on second and third-class seedlings, and prioritizing topdressing and pest control.
    In the campaign to exceed contracted production targets, it is imperative to mobilize the masses; united as one, we can be invincible! This is the inspiration the Dahu Production Team gives us.

    万众一心
    当前，早秋作物已经成熟或接近成熟；早播的晚秋作物正是盛长时期，南方地区还正在突击扩种晚秋作物。今后一段时间，正是争取秋粮超产的黄金时刻。因此，抓时间就是抓粮食！
    山东省邹县城关公社大胡生产队抓住了这个时刻，他们及时地组织力量全面检查了作物生长情况，同时发动社员讨论了前七个半月的生产计划执行情况和今后的超产措施。在讨论中，广大社员认清了当前的生产形势，人人干劲十足；有了劲头，又摸清了生产的“底”，群策群力，就找到了超产的关键：把百分之九十以上劳力投入秋田管理，以二、三类苗为主要对象，以追肥、治虫为主要措施。
    在超包产运动中，一定要把群众发动起来；万众一心，就能无往不胜！这就是大胡生产队给我们的启示。
