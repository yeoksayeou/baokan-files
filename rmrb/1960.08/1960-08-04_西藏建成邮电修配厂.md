Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa – Tibet's first postal and telecommunications repair factory, built to meet the growing needs of Tibet's postal and telecommunications services, has recently been officially put into production in Lhasa.

　　This factory was built entirely from scratch. The factory director, technicians, and workers were all transferred from various departments of the Tibet Postal and Telecommunications Administration after they had vigorously engaged in technical innovation and improved work efficiency. Without factory buildings, the employees voluntarily vacated their houses; when that wasn't enough, they built a cloth shed. Without raw materials, they searched everywhere for scrap copper, scrap iron, and broken lathes. Although the factory buildings and equipment were simple, the employees were very enthusiastic. In the half-month since production began, they have already produced more than ten kinds of products, such as conference telephones, small switchboards, and distribution boxes, and have converted five hand-cranked generators into electric motors. They are also constantly carrying out technical innovations in production. In the past, only seventy-two electrical coils for distribution boxes could be made each day, and a lot of materials were wasted. After eight experiments, they finally started semi-mechanization, increasing work efficiency more than twenty times.

    西藏建成邮电修配厂
    新华社拉萨电　为适应西藏邮电事业不断发展需要而建设的西藏第一个邮电修配厂，最近已在拉萨正式投入生产。
    这个工厂完全是白手起家办起来的。厂长、技术员和工人，都是西藏邮电管理局大闹技术革新提高工效后从各部门抽调出来的。没有厂房，职工们就自动腾出房子，还不够，再搭个布棚；没有原料他们就到处寻找破铜烂铁和破车床。厂房、设备虽然简陋，职工的干劲却很大。投入生产半个多月来，已经造出了会议电话机、小型交换机、分线箱等十多种产品，并将五部手摇发电机改成了电动机。他们还在生产中不断进行技术革新。分线箱用的电圈，过去每天只能做七十二个，浪费器材也大，他们经过八次试验，终于搞起了半机械化，工效提高了二十多倍。
