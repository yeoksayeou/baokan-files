    Organizing Production, Adjusting Surpluses and Deficits, Meeting Supply
    Zhangsanying Store Tries Every Possible Way to Serve Agriculture

    (By our reporter) The Zhangsanying Store in Longhua County, Hebei Province, has brought its commercial strengths into full play and vigorously supported agricultural production.
    This year, Zhangsanying is planting more high-yield crops, and weeding requires a large number of weeding hoes. Grasping this point, the store helped the commune's farm tool factory to produce weeding hoes on a large scale by providing equipment, supplying raw materials, solving funding problems, providing technology, and guaranteeing sales of products. The factory lacked raw materials, so the store supplied 9,200 jin of scrap iron and steel and 140,000 jin of waste wood through purchases. To solve technical difficulties, the store obtained blueprints from the county and sent weeding hoes manufactured by large factories in the past to the factory as models. With the joint efforts of industry and commerce, more than 150 weeding hoes were produced.
    The Zhangsanying Store learned that some production teams had more draught animals while others had fewer. Teams with more draught animals wanted to sell some due to the lack of fodder, while teams with fewer animals wanted to buy livestock but lacked money. The store organized three production teams near the deep mountains, such as Haqin Gou, to cut more than 140,000 jin of white grass during agricultural breaks. The store helped the production teams with more livestock solve the fodder problem through purchase and sales. Teams with fewer livestock wanted to buy livestock, but the teams with more livestock mostly sold old, weak, and sick animals. The store adopted a comprehensive package approach, purchasing old, weak, sick, and disabled animals and carefully raising them. In half a year, the store purchased more than 500 cattle and more than 170 donkeys, divided them into seven grazing groups, grazed them in special groups, and fed them by special personnel, so that more than 70 sick animals recovered their health, more than 191 weak animals became strong animals, and more than 120 inferior animals were trained into working animals. Finally, seven production teams were able to buy the necessary draught animals.
    Local commune members often climb mountains and walk on stone roads, which is very hard on shoes. In the past, people had to travel more than ten miles to Zhangsanying to repair shoes. The store's shoe repair group often accumulated more than 100 pairs of shoes, and commune members were urging them to wear them, so the repair group was working day and night but still couldn't keep up. To solve this problem, the store organized auxiliary laborers and disabled commune members who could not participate in field labor, and after training by the shoe repair group, they quickly mastered shoe repair techniques. Each production team established a shoe repair group, and commune members repaired their shoes when they were worn out. In the past, five pairs of shoes were needed a year, but now three pairs are generally enough, greatly reducing the housework of female commune members.
    The store also sent more than 100 cadres to form ten mobile stores, divided into areas and fixed points, to go to the forefront of production to handle purchases and supplies. In the past, mobile deliveries only carried small commodities, and commune members still had to go to the store to buy daily necessities. Now, fixed stores have been transformed into mobile stores, and all commodities have been moved to brigades, teams, mountain gullies, and small branches, directly meeting with the masses of commune members, greatly facilitating the masses. According to statistics from July 20 to 30, the sales of the ten mobile stores were more than twice the sales of the store's four stores.

### 组织生产　调剂有无　满足供应  张三营商店千方百计为农业服务

    组织生产　调剂有无　满足供应
    张三营商店千方百计为农业服务
    本报讯　河北省隆化县张三营商店发挥商业特长，有力地支援了农业生产。
    今年张三营种的高产作物多，中耕除草需要大量耘锄。商店抓住这一点，采取提供设备、供应原料、解决资金、提供技术和包销产品的方法，帮助公社农具厂大搞耘锄生产。工厂缺乏原料，商店通过收购，供给废钢铁九千二百斤，废木材十四万斤。为了解决技术困难，商店从县里找来图纸，还把过去大工厂制造的耘锄送到工厂作样板。工商同心协力，生产出一百五十多台耘锄。
    张三营商店了解到有的生产队畜力多，有些队畜力少。畜力多的队，因缺少饲草，想卖掉一部分，畜力少的队想买牲畜没有钱。商店就组织靠近深山的哈沁沟等三个生产队，利用农活空隙，割了十四万多斤白草。商店通过购销的办法，帮助牲畜多的生产队解决了饲草问题。牲畜少的队要买牲畜，但是牲畜多的队出售的多是老弱病畜。商店采取一包到底的办法，把老、弱、病、残畜收购下来，精心饲养。半年来，商店共收购牛五百多头、毛驴一百七十多头，分成七个放牧群，专群放牧，专人饲养，使七十多头病畜恢复了健康，使一百九十一头弱畜变成了壮畜，使一百二十多头菜畜驯成役畜。终于使七个生产队买到了必要的耕畜。
    当地社员常爬山走石头路，很费鞋。过去人们要跑十几里路到张三营修鞋。商店修鞋组经常积存一百多双鞋，社员等穿紧催，修理组昼夜干也忙不过来。为解决这个问题，商店组织各生产队不能参加田间劳动的辅助劳力和有残疾的社员，经过修鞋组培训，很快掌握了修鞋技术。各生产队都建立了修鞋组，社员们穿坏了就修，过去一年需要五双鞋，现在一般的有三双就够了，大大减轻了女社员的家务劳动。
    商店还派出百余名干部，组成十个流动商店，划片定点，到生产第一线，包收购，包供应。过去，流动送货只带小商品，社员照常得去商店购买生活用品，现在变固定商店为流动商店，所有商品搬到了大队、小队、山沟、小岔，直接和社员群众见面，大大便利了群众。据7月20日到30日的统计，十个流动商店的收售额，等于商店四个门市部收售额的两倍多。
