    Growing Up Under the Nurturing of the Party
    Xiaofan, Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant

    When I first stepped into the factory gate, among the apprentices, I was the youngest and the shortest. So, when we had evening gatherings, everyone liked to have me say a few clapper rhymes, sing a little song, read a few lines of poetry, or read a short story from the newspaper. This was the beginning of my contact with literature and art.

    Around the beginning of 1956, I began to pick up a pen and write some small articles. Because when I first came into contact with literature and art, I mostly read short stories and satirical poems.

    The Great Leap Forward began in 1958, and it was also the beginning of my writing. During those days and nights of the steel production battles, so many admirable people and deeds emerged. These new people and new things gave me a very profound class education, and I felt it was my duty to publicize these moving deeds. At this time, our factory Party organization also established a mass creation guidance committee. The director of the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee often personally presided over the meetings of the creation group, guiding everyone in their studies. At almost every meeting, it was particularly emphasized that literature and art are a part of the revolutionary cause; that literature and art serve politics and production. Therefore, those engaged in literature and art must unswervingly adhere to the principle of putting politics in command. Only in this way can they create works that are beneficial to the people.

    With a clear writing purpose, creation became diligent. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, production was very tense, but in that year I published more than fifty long and short poems. The poems were published under my personal name, but in fact they were all collective creations, because not a single one of my poems met the readers without being revised and processed by others (Party leaders, newspaper editors, and comrades around me).

    I also encountered some difficulties in my creative work, mainly because I was struggling to improve.

    How to improve my creative level? For a child who had only attended school for less than six years, this was indeed a very complicated matter. In the first half of 1959, apart from works that matched political tasks, I published very little. Although I was in the midst of the fiery struggle, I couldn’t seriously study or understand life. I was troubled like this, and the more troubled I was, the less poetry I could write; the less poetry I could write, the more troubled I became. The Party organization and the Shenyang Branch of the Writers Association quickly grasped my ideological situation and provided me with various kinds of help. The comrades in the editorial department of *Literary Youth* asked me to repeatedly and earnestly study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party; the factory Party committee instructed me to work hard and meticulously study life, and said that I should not only look at the phenomena, but also see the essence of life through the phenomena of life, and see the ideological outlook of the people. After the Party reminded me, I began to pay attention to making efforts in this direction. At first, I also thought it was impossible to start. How exactly can one see the essence through the phenomena? There was no way. At this time, I seriously read Chairman Mao's works, read *On Contradiction*, *On Practice*, and *Talks at the Yenan Forum on Literature and Art*. After reading them several times, I felt much brighter in my heart.

    After seriously strengthening political study and studying various life phenomena, I discovered many creative themes. For example, in the past, I heard the sounds of gongs and drums reporting victories every day, but I didn't realize that the sound of the gongs and drums itself was a poem. But when I seriously and repeatedly pondered what the sound of the gongs and drums meant, I came to the conclusion and wrote these lines of poetry:

    The sound of the drum solemnly proclaims to the world,
    That China's steed has galloped another step forward!

    Again, in the past, I often saw workers arguing red-faced over certain matters, but I didn't realize that there was also poetry in the sound of the argument. At this time, I discovered that it was a very good subject for poetry, because:

    "This way can melt one more furnace of iron!"
    "That way can produce one more ton of steel!"
    After the argument is a huge victory,
    Victory is brewing the next argument...

    From this kind of example, I realized the importance of going deep into life, as emphasized by Chairman Mao in *Talks at the Yenan Forum on Literature and Art*, and realized the error of my narrowly understanding creative level as a technical issue. I discovered that the reason I had fallen into the abyss of distress in the past was that I thought worker-writers did not need to go deep into life (study life), took a detour, and drilled into the "technical" dead end.

    After seriously studying Chairman Mao's works, analyzing and studying life phenomena, and rooting myself more deeply in the soil of life, the past situation was fundamentally changed, freeing me from the siege of "distress." Workers often laugh loudly, and this laughter often expresses their bold character of despising difficulties. In the face of difficulties, laughter leads the way; workers are ahead of time every month, leaving the planners behind, because their hearts store a "red calendar"; the master worker scolds the young apprentice with a red face and thick neck, because of his "love" for the motherland, for the cause of communism, and for the young apprentice. In short, after I went "a floor lower" in life, I went "a floor higher" in poetry creation. Therefore, from the second half of 1959 to now, I have published more than forty poems reflecting factory life, although these poems are all quite rough.

    Over the past few years, I have realized from the process of learning to write that creation is no simpler than producing machines. After breaking through the first difficulty, I quickly encountered the second difficulty—still the problem of improvement. For example, when the rectification movement had just begun, the leaders of the factory Party organization and the Shenyang Branch of the Writers Association once instructed me, saying that after the rectification movement, people's awareness will be greatly improved, and communist ideology will radiate more brilliantly. Therefore, if the ideological level of amateur authors cannot be quickly improved, it will be impossible to reflect the spiritual outlook of this new generation. At the same time, they also pointed out that in the future, we must strive to express the shining communist ideology of the people. Later, I made some efforts according to this instruction. With the help of the Shenyang Branch of the Writers Association and the editorial department of *Literary Youth*, I wrote the narrative poem *A Riot of Color*, which reflects the communist ideological outlook. After the first draft was given to the editorial department of *Literary Youth*, they gave opinions on the poem. When I revised this poem for the first time, I only changed the lines "slender" and "face is red," but the style and emotion were still the same as in the first draft. This time, when I took it to the editorial department, the comrades gave me their opinions again. In the second revision, I revised it according to the comrades' opinions. I enthusiastically praised everything that the workers loved, and I deleted everything that the workers usually hated. In this way, it was much better than the previous two drafts. From this, it can be seen that for a poem reflecting factory life, only when the emotion is completely that of the workers, can it possibly be a better poem; if the emotion is not that of the workers, it cannot be a good poem! When revising *A Riot of Color* and shaping the image of Yang Chunhong, I always felt more strenuous and difficult than writing in the past. According to some comrades in the Writers Association and some comrades in our factory Party committee, this is mainly because the ideological level of the protagonist in the poem is very high, but the author cannot keep up, cannot grasp the psychological activities of the protagonist, and therefore has not written this poem well. I myself have this feeling. The process of creating *A Riot of Color* once again vividly told me that if you want to write good poems on industrial themes, the author's thoughts and feelings must be completely and thoroughly proletarianized; otherwise, everything is a pipe dream!

    From the day I started learning to write, the Shenyang Branch of the Writers Association gave me many learning opportunities and help, and at the end of 1958, admitted me as a member of the branch. These all embody the Party's training and care for a young worker. The senior writers of the branch not only talked to me about works and creative techniques, but more importantly, helped me politically and ideologically.

    In the past two years, although more than one hundred long and short poems have been published in my name, in fact, they are not poems I wrote. They were all written by the big hand of the Party holding my little hand; they were all written by hundreds of hands!

    在党的哺育下成长
    沈阳重型机器厂　晓凡
    当我刚刚踏进工厂大门的时候，在徒工们中间，我的年龄最小，个子最矮，所以开晚会的时候大家总喜欢让我给说几句快板，唱个小曲，读几句诗或者照着报纸读段小故事。这就是我接触文学艺术的开始。
    大约是1956年初，自己也拿起笔来写点小文章。因为一开始接触文艺的时候，看的多数是小故事、讽刺诗。
    1958年开始大跃进，也是我写作的开始。在那些夺钢大战的日日夜夜里，涌现出那么多可歌可颂的人物、事迹。这些新人新事，给了我极深刻的阶级教育，觉得自己有义务把这些动人事迹宣传出去。这时，我们工厂党组织也成立了群众创作指导委员会。党委宣传部长经常亲自主持创作组的会议，指导大家进行学习。几乎在每一次会议上，都特别强调文艺是革命事业的一部分；文艺是为政治、为生产服务的，因而搞文艺的人必须坚定不移地坚持政治挂帅，只有这样，才能创作出对人民有益的作品。
    明确了写作目的，创作也就勤恳了。在1958年大跃进中，生产是很紧张的，可是在这一年中我发表了五十多首长、短诗。诗是以个人名义发表的，实际上都是集体创作，因为我的诗没有一首是不经过别人（党的领导同志、报刊编辑、周围的同志）修改、加工才和读者见面的。
    创作也遇到一些困难，主要是苦于无法提高。
    怎样把创作水平提高一步？这对于我这个只读过不足六年书的孩子来说，的确是件很复杂的事情。在1959年上半年，除了配合政治任务的作品以外，我几乎很少发表东西。自己虽然置身于火热的斗争中，但却不能去认真地研究生活、理解生活。自己就是这样苦恼着，越是苦恼，就越写不出诗来，越是写不出诗来就越苦恼。党组织和作协沈阳分会很快便掌握了我的思想情况，分别对我进行各方面的帮助。《文学青年》编辑部的同志，要我反复认真学习党的八届八中全会的文件；工厂党委指示我要我努力、细致地研究生活，并说不能只看现象，而要透过生活现象去看生活的本质，看到人们的思想面貌。党提醒我以后，自己便开始注意从这方面努力。开初，自己也以为无法入手，究竟怎样透过现象看到本质呢？毫无办法。这时，我就认真地去读毛主席著作，读《矛盾论》、《实践论》，读《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。认真地读过几遍之后，觉得心里亮堂了好多。
    认真地加强了政治学习，研究各类生活现象，就发掘出很多创作题材。比如，过去天天听到报捷的锣鼓声，却没有认识到这锣鼓声本身就是一首诗，可是当自己认真地反复思索了锣鼓声中意味着什么的时候，就得出了结论，写出了这样的诗行：
    鼓声庄严地向世界宣告，
    中国的骏马又向前飞奔了一程！
    再如，过去也常常看到工人同志们为了某些事情争论得面红耳赤，但就是没有意识到这争论声中也有诗，这时候却发现了它是很好的诗的题材，因为：
    “这样能多化一炉铁！”
    “那样能多出一吨钢！”
    争论过后是一个巨大的胜利，
    胜利中又把下一次争论酝酿
      ……
    从这一类事例中，使我体会到了毛主席在《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中所强调的深入生活的重要性，认识到了自己把创作水平狭隘地理解为技术问题的错误，发现自己过去之所以陷入苦恼的深渊中，是自己认为工人作者不需要深入生活（研究生活），走了弯路，钻到“技术”的死角里去了。
    认真地学习毛主席著作，分析、研究了生活现象，更深地扎根到生活的土壤中去以后，根本改变了过去的局面，使我从“苦恼”的重围中解脱出来。工人们常常放声大笑，这笑声往往表现了他们蔑视困难的豪爽的性格，面对困难，笑声开道；工人月月走在时间的前头，把计划员抛在后边，是因为他们的心中储藏着“红色日历”；老师傅脸红脖子粗地训斥青年徒工，是由于对祖国、对共产主义事业、对青年徒工的“爱”。总之，当我在生活上“更下一层楼”之后，在诗歌创作上便“更上一层楼”。因而，从1959年下半年到现在，我共发表了四十多首反映工厂生活的诗，虽然这些诗都挺粗糙。
    几年来从学习写作过程中使我体会到，创作并不比生产机器简单。当突破第一个难关之后，很快又遇到了第二个困难——仍然是提高的问题。比如在整风运动刚刚开始的时候，工厂党组织和作协沈阳分会的领导同志曾指示我说，整风运动后人们的觉悟将有很大提高，共产主义思想将要放射出更加灿烂的光芒，因此如果业余作者的思想水平不能很快地提高，那就无法反映这一代新人的精神面貌。同时，他们还指出，今后一定要努力去表现人们那闪闪发光的共产主义思想。后来，我按着这个指示做了一些努力，在作协沈阳分会及《文学青年》编辑部的帮助下，写出了《万紫千红》这首反映共产主义思想面貌的叙事诗。初稿交给《文学青年》编辑部看过之后，他们对诗提出了意见。在第一遍修改这首诗的时候，我只改了“窈窕”和“脸儿红”等诗行，而格调和感情却还同第一次稿时一模一样。这回拿到编辑部去，同志们又给提出了意见。在第二次修改时，我按着同志们的意见去修改，凡是工人们喜爱的东西，我就热情地加以歌颂；凡是平素工人们厌恶的，我都把它们删掉。这样一来，就比前两遍稿强了好多。从这里可以看出，反映工厂生活的诗，只有感情完全是工人的，它才有可能是一首较好的诗；假使感情不是工人的，它就不可能是好诗！在修改《万紫千红》塑造杨春红这一形象时，自己总感到比过去写东西吃力、困难。据作协的一些同志及我们工厂党委的一些同志说，这主要是因为诗中主人公的思想水平很高，而作者跟不上去，把握不住主人公的心理活动，因而没有把这首诗写好。我自己也有这种感觉。创作《万紫千红》的过程再一次生动地告诉我，要想写好工业题材的诗篇，作者的思想感情必须是毫无保留的彻底工人化；否则，一切都是空想！
    从我开始学习写作的那天起，作协沈阳分会就给我很多学习机会和帮助，并于1958年年末吸收我为作协分会会员。这些，都体现了党对一个青年工人的培养与关怀。分会的前辈作家们不仅同我谈作品，谈创作技巧，更重要的是从政治思想上，对我进行帮助。
    两年来，虽然以我的名字发表了一百多首长短诗，实际上都不是我写的诗，都是党的大手把着我的小手写成的；都是几百双手写成的！
