Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Telegram Sichuan Province is widely carrying out the "Five Good" cadre appraisal and competition movement in rural areas, promoting the solid participation of the vast number of rural cadres in production and leadership of production. At present, rural cadres throughout the province are vigorously promoting the style of closely connecting with the masses and going deep into reality, and a large number of "Five Good" cadres have emerged. According to preliminary statistics from more than a dozen counties such as Wusheng, Ziyang, and Zhongjiang, "Five Good" cadres account for approximately 50% to 60% of the total number of rural cadres.

The "Five Good" cadre appraisal and competition is a new form created in the appraisal and competition movement in rural Sichuan Province since the Great Leap Forward. Party organizations in many areas, such as the Nanmu Commune Party Committee in Peng County, have been using this form for the past year or two to make political and ideological work regular, universal, specific, and diverse. This year, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China affirmed the experience of the Nanmu Commune and instructed all localities to make full use of this form to promote cadres to do a good job in "Four Togethernesses" (eating together, living together, laboring together, and discussing together) and "Two Participations" (participating in production and participating in dining in the canteen), so that cadre work is more in-depth and the style is more democratic.

The conditions for "Five Good" cadres are generally: good political and ideological work, good implementation of the Party's policies, good production labor, good democratic style, and good concern for the lives of the masses. However, these conditions vary and focus depending on the region, production unit, and time period. For example, at present, various places take "Four Togethernesses" and "Two Participations" as the main content of evaluating "Five Good" cadres, and specific standards suitable for the region and unit for a certain period of time are formulated for each condition. In terms of appraisal time, it is generally appraised once a month, and some take a central task as an appraisal stage. The "Five Good" cadres who are appraised are commended through methods such as honor rolls and sending congratulatory messages. The "Five Good" cadre appraisal and competition in various places is also often carried out simultaneously with the "Five Good" commune member appraisal and competition, so that cadres and commune members can understand each other, encourage each other, and help each other through the appraisal and competition, learning from each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses. Under the leadership of cadres, commune members are becoming more and more motivated and their enthusiasm for production is getting higher and higher. With the help of commune members, the style of cadres is also more in-depth and they are working better. After the Dakang Commune in Jiangyou County launched the "Five Good" appraisal and competition in March this year, all more than 200 cadres in the commune achieved "Four Togethernesses" and "Two Participations". In production, they are both commanders and fighters, in life they are good housekeepers for commune members, and in politics they are good teachers for commune members. At present, production in the commune is doing very well, commune members are full of energy, and the number of people going to work is often more than 90%.

The appraisal and competition of "Five Good" cadres and "Five Good" party members is also a good leadership method for rural party organizations to grasp the two ends and lead the middle, and improve the level of the vast number of cadres and party members. Through the regular appraisal of "Five Good" cadres, setting up models, and inserting red flags, the rural cadres of the entire province have quickly set off a socialist competition upsurge of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward." Wusheng, a red flag county in the province, has insisted on "Five Good" appraisal and competition for more than a year. According to statistics at the end of last year, there were more than 1,200 cadre models at the county level alone. In addition, there were an average of more than 500 red flag bearers and activists in each people's commune. Now, most of the cadres in the county have reached the standards of excellent cadres put forward by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China: "firm stance, advanced thinking, full of energy, and in-depth style."

The "Five Good" cadre appraisal and competition movement in Sichuan Province has powerfully promoted current rural production. Cadres of Feng'an Commune in Zizhong County insisted on "Four Togethernesses" and "Two Participations" through the "Five Good" appraisal, and by the end of June, the commune's spring sowing area had increased by 34% compared with last year. In early June, more than 3,000 mu of sweet potatoes in the commune had to be ridged, and more than 2,000 mu of corn had to be earthed up and seedlings raised. Labor and time were very tight, and it was almost a delay in farming. After the secretary of the commune party committee went deep into the first team of the first brigade, he worked with the commune members and discussed together, and found a way to reasonably arrange the work. All the cadres of the commune immediately led the commune members to carry out a shock, and as a result, not only was the task completed two days ahead of schedule, but also more than 4,000 laborers were saved. Now, cadres in many areas of the province have taken the lead in everything, taking the lead in difficult situations, and taking the lead in tackling backwardness, etc. More than 1,000 rural cadres at all levels in Peng'an County went deep into remote areas and backward areas during the rush planting, participating in production and leading production, which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the commune members. In just a few days in early July, the county eliminated more than 30,000 mu of empty fields and empty land. Cadres at all levels in Longchang County are driving other production teams by engaging in "three-combination" experimental fields with commune members and technicians, and by cultivating the production teams to which they belong into red flag teams. Now, production in the county is getting better and better, and there are more and more models. From the county to the production team, everyone is planting experimental fields and everyone is making high yields. By early July, the county had basically achieved full planting, eliminating empty fields and empty land. Corn and sorghum have been generally cultivated and earthed up once, and topdressed twice. Rice and sweet potato production is good. At the same time, the number of red flag communes in the county has also increased from one to six, and a brand-new situation has emerged in which every commune, every management area, and every production team has a red flag.

    推动干部踏踏实实地参加生产领导生产
    四川开展“五好”干部评比竞赛运动
    新华社成都电　四川省农村广泛开展“五好”干部评比竞赛运动，推动了广大农村干部踏踏实实参加生产领导生产。目前，全省农村干部大兴密切联系群众、深入实际之风，“五好”干部大量涌现。据武胜、资阳、中江等十几个县的初步统计，“五好”干部约占农村干部总数的50％到60％。
      “五好”干部的评比竞赛，是大跃进以来四川省农村评比竞赛运动中创造的一种新形式。不少地区的农村党组织，例如彭县楠木公社党委，在近一两年来一直利用这种形式，使政治思想工作做到了经常化、普遍化、具体化、多样化。今年，中共四川省委肯定了楠木公社的经验，并指示各地充分利用这种形式，推动各级干部做好“四同”。（即同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量）、“两参”（即参加生产、参加食堂吃饭），使干部工作更加深入，作风更加民主。
    “五好”干部的条件一般是：政治思想工作好，贯彻执行党的政策好，生产劳动好，民主作风好，关心群众生活好。但是，这些条件随着地区、生产单位和时期的不同，又有所变化和侧重。例如，目前各地就以“四同”、“两参”作为评选“五好”干部的主要内容，并且对每一个条件都拟出了适合本地区、本单位的一定时期的具体标准。在评比时间上，一般每月评比一次，有的则以一项中心工作作为一个评比阶段。评出的“五好”干部都通过光荣榜、送喜报等办法加以表扬。各地“五好”干部的评比竞赛，还经常和“五好”社员的评比竞赛同时进行，使干部、社员通过评比竞赛相互了解、相互激励、相互帮助，取长补短。在干部带动下，社员干劲越来越足，生产热情愈来愈高；在社员的帮助下，干部的作风也更加深入，劳动得更好。江油县大康公社今年3月开展“五好”评比竞赛后，全社两百多名干部个个做到“四同”、“两参”，在生产上既是指挥员，又是战斗员，在生活上是社员的好管家，在政治上是社员的好教员。目前，全社生产搞得很好，社员干劲十足，出工人数经常在90％以上。
    “五好”干部和“五好”党员的评比竞赛同时又是农村党组织抓两头，带中间，提高广大干部和党员水平的一个很好的领导方法。通过定期评选“五好”干部，树标兵、插红旗，全省农村干部已经迅速掀起“比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进”的社会主义竞赛运动高潮。全省红旗县武胜，近一年多来坚持“五好”评比竞赛，据去年年底统计，仅县一级干部标兵就有一千二百多人，此外，平均每个人民公社有五百多名红旗手和积极分子。现在，全县大部分干部都达到了中共四川省委提出的“立场坚定、思想先进、干劲十足、作风深入”的优秀干部标准。
    四川省的“五好”干部评比竞赛运动，有力地推动了当前农村生产。资中县奉安公社干部通过“五好”评比，全社一百七十名干部坚持做到了“四同”、“两参”，到6月底，全社大春播种面积已比去年扩大了34％。6月初，全社有三千多亩红薯要垒厢，两千多亩玉米要壅兜、提苗，劳动力和时间都很紧张，眼看快误农时。公社党委书记深入第一大队第一小队后，和社员一起劳动，共同商量，找出了合理安排活路的办法，全社干部立即带领社员突击，结果不但提前两天完成了任务，还节约了四千多个劳动力。现在，全省不少地区的干部已经做到事事带头，难关带头，突击落后带头等“三带头”。蓬安县一千多名各级农村干部，在突击栽种中，深入边远地区和后进地区，参加生产领导生产，大大鼓舞了社员的生产情绪，仅7月初的短短几天中，全县就消灭了三万多亩空田空土。隆昌县各级干部通过和社员、技术员搞“三结合”试验田，以及把自己所在的生产队培养成为红旗队的办法，来带动其他生产队。现在，全县生产愈来愈好，标兵愈来愈多，从县到生产队，人人种试验田，个个闹高产。到7月上旬，全县已基本实现满栽满插，消灭了空田空土，玉米、高粱已经普遍中耕、培土一次，追肥二次，水稻、红苕生产良好。同时，全县的红旗公社也从一个增加到六个，出现了每个公社、每个管理区、每个生产队都有红旗的崭新局面。
