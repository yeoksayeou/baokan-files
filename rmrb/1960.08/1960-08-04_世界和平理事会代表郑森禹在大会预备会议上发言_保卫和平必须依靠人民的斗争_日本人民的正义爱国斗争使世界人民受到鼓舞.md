Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd: Zheng Senyu, representative of the World Peace Council, delivered a speech at the preparatory meeting of the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament on the 2nd. The full text is as follows:

    We are grateful to the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs for inviting the World Peace Council to send a delegation to participate in this conference. We would like to pay our highest respects to the Japanese people who have made significant contributions to the cause of defending world peace, and extend our greetings to the delegates attending this conference.

    The World Peace Council steadfastly supports the Japanese movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs and the meetings convened by this movement, resolutely supports the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, against military bases, against the revival of militarism, and for an independent, democratic, peaceful and neutral path. People all over the world sympathize with and care about the difficult situation of the Japanese people, who have suffered from the disasters of atomic and hydrogen bomb explosions, and are still suffering from the damage caused by the existence of foreign military bases.

    The just and patriotic struggle of the Japanese people not only conforms to the national interests of Japan, but also to the interests of all peace-loving people in the world. This struggle is an important part of the struggle of people all over the world against imperialist wars and aggression policies, and for defending world peace. The victory won by the Japanese people has heavily hit the imperialist plot to launch a new war and plays an important role in defending world peace.

    Just three weeks ago, at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council held in Stockholm, representatives of various countries unanimously expressed their support for the struggle of the Japanese people. The meeting adopted a special resolution for this purpose. In this resolution, the struggle of the Japanese people was given a high evaluation.

    The resolution said: "Peace-loving people all over the world are moved and encouraged by the great performance of the Japanese people in their struggle for peace in recent years, especially in recent months." The resolution believes that the unified national action of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is not only unprecedented in Japanese history, but also greatly encourages the world peace cause and the struggle against aggression. The resolution believes that "this historically significant victory of the Japanese people is a victory for all peace-loving people in the world—including the majority of the American people who yearn for peace." The resolution stated that the World Peace Council will do everything possible to support the just and patriotic struggle of the Japanese people for the final abolition of this treaty. The declaration adopted by the Asian and African representatives attending that meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council also stated "to extend the warmest greetings to the heroic Japanese people who are struggling against the control of their country by U.S. imperialism, against the revival of Japanese militarism, and against the newly revised Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and to fully support them."

    Previous world conferences against atomic and hydrogen bombs have each played an important role in defending world peace. The current Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament is being held at a time when the people of Japan and the world have successively achieved victories in the struggle against imperialist aggression and for defending world peace. We are deeply convinced that this conference will achieve greater victories and make new and more significant contributions to defending world peace.

    It should be pointed out that defending world peace must rely on the unity of the masses and their struggle for it. The movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs and the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, which have a broad mass base and have mobilized and united the broad masses of the people, are good examples. As long as the people of the world strengthen unity, remain vigilant, continue to expose the war plots of the enemies of peace, and resolutely fight against them, they will surely achieve greater victories in defending world peace. As the recent Stockholm meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council pointed out: "The people of the world increasingly understand who the enemies of peace are. In order to defeat their attempts, the world peace movement must intensify its struggle more forcefully than ever before. In order to carry out this struggle, all the peace forces in the world must maintain and develop the closest unity and cooperation."

    The current international situation is very favorable for defending world peace. The struggle of the people of all countries against imperialist wars and aggression policies, against military bases, against aggressive military treaties, for reaching agreements on stopping nuclear tests, prohibiting nuclear weapons and disarmament, for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, for convening summit conferences, against colonialism, and for winning and defending national independence is becoming increasingly widespread and developing. The imperialist war forces headed by the United States have been hit one after another, and the peace forces are growing stronger. Let us unite more closely and fight together to further expose and defeat our common enemy, the imperialist war forces, and defend world peace.

    We wish the conference success.

    Long live world peace!

    保卫和平必须依靠人民的斗争
    日本人民的正义爱国斗争使世界人民受到鼓舞
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：世界和平理事会代表郑森禹2日在第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会预备会议上作了发言。全文如下：
    我们对日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会邀请世界和平理事会派遣代表团参加这次大会，表示感谢。我们愿意向对保卫世界和平事业作出了重大贡献的日本人民致以崇高的敬礼，并向参加这次大会的代表们致意。
    世界和平理事会坚持不渝地支持日本反对原子弹和氢弹的运动以及这个运动所召开的会议，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约，反对军事基地，反对军国主义的复活和要求走独立、民主、和平和中立的道路的斗争。全世界人民都同情和关怀日本人民的困难处境，
  日本人民遭受过原子弹轰炸和氢弹试验的灾难，而且现在还由于外国军事基地的存在而遭受着损害。
    日本人民的正义和爱国斗争不仅符合于日本的民族利益，而且也符合于全世界所有爱好和平人民的利益。这个斗争是全世界各国人民反对帝国主义战争和侵略政策，争取保卫世界和平的斗争的一个重要组成部分。日本人民所赢得的胜利沉重地打击了帝国主义发动新战争的阴谋，并在保卫世界和平方面起着重要作用。
    就在三个星期以前，在斯德哥尔摩举行的世界和平理事会常务委员会会议上，各国代表一致表示支持日本人民的斗争。会议为此通过了一项特别决议。在这项决议中对日本人民的斗争给予很高的评价。
    决议说：“全世界爱好和平的人民由于最近几年内，特别是最近几个月内日本人民争取和平活动的伟大表现而受到感动和鼓舞。”决议认为，日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的全国统一行动不仅在日本历史上是空前的，而且也大大鼓舞了世界和平事业和反对侵略的斗争。决议认为：“日本人民的这种具有历史意义的胜利是全世界爱好和平人民——其中包括切望和平的大部分美国人民在内——的胜利”。决议说，世界和平理事会将亟尽一切努力支持日本人民为最后废除这项条约而进行的正义和爱国的斗争。参加世界和平理事会常务委员会那次会议的亚非代表所通过的宣言也表示“向正在为反对美帝国主义控制他们的国家，反对日本军国主义的复活和反对新修改的日美军事同盟条约而进行斗争的英勇的日本人民致以最热烈的敬礼，并全力支持他们。”
    以前几次禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会，每一次在保卫世界和平方面都起了重要的作用。目前第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会正是在日本和全世界人民在反对帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的斗争中相继取得胜利的时候举行的。我们深信，这次大会将取得更大的胜利，对保卫世界和平将作出新的更加重大的贡献。
    应当指出，保卫世界和平必须依靠人民群众的团结和他们为此而进行的斗争。拥有广泛群众基础、并且动员和团结了广大人民群众的禁止原子弹和氢弹的运动和反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，就是一个很好的例子。只要全世界人民加强团结，保持警惕，继续揭露和平的敌人的战争阴谋，并且坚决同他们进行斗争，他们一定会在保卫世界和平方面取得更大的胜利。正如世界和平理事会常务委员会最近的斯德哥尔摩会议所指出的：“世界人民越来越懂得谁是和平的敌人。为了击败他们的企图，世界和平运动必须比以往更加有力地加紧进行斗争。为了进行这个斗争，全世界所有的和平力量必须保持和发展最密切的团结和合作。”
    目前的国际局势十分有利于保卫世界和平。各国人民反对帝国主义的战争和侵略政策，反对军事基地，反对侵略性的军事条约，争取达成关于停止核试验，禁止核武器和裁军的协议，争取不同社会制度的国家和平共处，争取召开政府首脑会议，反对殖民主义以及争取和保卫民族独立的斗争日益广泛和发展。以美国为首的帝国主义战争势力接二连三地受到打击，而和平力量日益加强。让我们更加紧密地团结起来，一起为进一步揭露和击败我们的共同敌人帝国主义战争势力和保卫世界和平而斗争。
    我们祝大会成功。
    世界和平万岁！
