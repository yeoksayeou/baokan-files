Letter to the Editor:

    We operate a tugboat on the Yangtze River, frequently towing barges carrying vital materials such as grain, steel, cement, and coal to various locations along the river. Since the beginning of this year, thanks to the in-depth campaign of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on high production and accident-free operation, we completed our production plan for the first half of the year seventy-three days ahead of schedule, exceeding the high-production target of 15,000 ton-kilometers per horsepower per month set by the Ministry of Transportation. We also won the title of "Champion Boat" in the "Production Games" held by the Yangtze River Navigation Administration.

    To vigorously support industrial and agricultural production centered on grain and steel, we are determined to continue to exert all our efforts based on our existing achievements, strive to excellently complete our transportation tasks, and fulfill our annual plan ahead of schedule.

    How can we ensure the early and over-fulfillment of our annual plan? In addition to breaking down the monthly plan targets into each voyage and assigning them to each team and individual, and conducting labor competitions among the various teams, we have also decided to take the following specific measures: 1. To save good coal and support steel mills in increasing production even more, we have put forward the slogan "Don't eat the marshal's rations first" and actively use low-quality coal as fuel. The method is: take the team led by veteran stoker Wen Huankun as a model and improve stoking operations. 2. Shorten the time spent in port and accelerate ship turnaround. The methods are: First, strengthen contact with the port, and understand the loading situation before each arrival at the dock, so as to quickly form a convoy; second, strengthen ship-port cooperation and actively help the port load and unload goods; third, load and transport quickly, making every second count. 3. Continue to deepen the campaign of technical innovation and technical revolution. 4. Strengthen maintenance and various preventive measures to ensure safe navigation.

    多运重点物资
    我们开的这条船是长江上的一条拖轮，经常拖带载运粮食、钢材、水泥、煤炭等重要物资的驳子，往沿线各地运送。今年以来，由于深入开展了以高产、无事故为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，我们提前七十三天完成了上半年的生产计划，超过了交通部提出的拖轮每马力月产一万五千吨公里的高产指标。在长江航运管理局举办的“生产运动会”中，还获得了“冠军船”的称号。
    为了大力支援以粮、钢为中心的工农业生产，我们决心在已有成绩的基础上，继续鼓足冲天干劲，力争出色地完成运输任务，提前完成全年计划。
    怎样保证提前超额完成全年计划呢？除把每月计划指标分解到每个航次，并落实到每个班组和个人，并在各个班组之间开展劳动竞赛以外，我们还决定采取以下几条具体措施：一、为了节省好煤，支援钢铁厂更多地增产，我们提出“先行不吃元帅粮”的口号，积极用劣质煤作燃料。办法是：以老生火工文焕坤领导的班为样板，改进生火操作。二、缩短停港时间，加速船舶周转。办法是：第一、加强同港口的联系，每次到码头之前，就了解装货情况，以便快速编队；第二、加强船港协作，主动帮助港口装卸货物；第三、快速装运，分秒必争。三、继续深入开展技术革新和技术革命运动。四、加强检修和各项预防工作，保证航行安全。
