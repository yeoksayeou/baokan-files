Xinhua News Agency, August 26th. TASS, Leopoldville, August 25th: Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba said on the evening of the 24th that certain Westerners are attempting to use the United Nations to achieve their own goals, using the United Nations to re-dress old colonialism, giving it a new form. Lumumba pointed out that in this regard, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld is playing a significant role.

Lumumba made these remarks when he received journalists from the Soviet "Pravda," the Italian "l'Unità," "Deutsche Presse-Agentur," and "The Observer."

Lumumba said that the Congolese government will use its own strength to solve the Katanga problem. He said that the only things preventing the central government from restoring order in Katanga are the presence of Belgian troops in Katanga and the support of some Western countries for Belgium and the puppet Tshombe.

Lumumba pointed out that the Congolese central government will restore order in Katanga because the vast majority of the people support the central government, while Tshombe's power is based solely on Belgian bayonets.

Speaking about the Congolese domestic economic problems, Lumumba said that the Belgian armed intervention has undermined the realization of our economic plans. If it had not been for the provocative armed intervention by Belgium, we would not have encountered such enormous difficulties.

Lumumba pointed out that the withdrawal of Belgian troops from the Congo would lay the foundation for the normalization of the national economic life.

When talking about the role of the United Nations in the Congo, Lumumba believed that the Security Council resolution had its positive significance, as it enabled Belgian troops to begin withdrawing from Congolese territory.

He emphasized that, however, our people and international public opinion should vigilantly monitor the future implementation of the Security Council resolution, because certain Westerners are attempting to use the United Nations to achieve their own goals.

The Congolese Republic government issued a communiqué on the 25th, stating: "Belgian colonialists are still attempting to intervene again in our country. This imperialist conspiracy is not fictitious. Evidence proving this is increasing."

The communiqué said, "Supported by the dark forces of international imperialism, Belgium has led the young Congolese Republic into a difficult situation. Faced with this serious difficulty, the Congolese people believe that their main task is to unite and unite all anti-colonial forces in the country."

In a radio address to the Congolese people, Lumumba said: "The Congolese, who were oppressed yesterday, are today holding the destiny of their country in their own hands. It has become impossible to deprive them of their national independence. However, only the unity of our people can maintain this independence. The attempts of international imperialism to restore colonialism in the Congo are doomed to failure."

    卢蒙巴总理接见外国记者说
    刚果将用自己力量解决加丹加问题
    谴责哈马舍尔德协助西方集团给旧殖民主义换上新装
    据新华社26日讯　据塔斯社利奥波德维尔25日讯：刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴24日晚上说，某些西方人士企图利用联合国达到他们自己的目的，借助于联合国使旧殖民主义改头换面，赋予它一个新的形式。卢蒙巴指出，在这一点上，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德起着不小的作用。
    卢蒙巴是在接见苏联“真理报”、意大利“团结报”、“德意志通讯社”和“观察家报”记者时说这番话的。
    卢蒙巴说，刚果政府将用自己的力量解决加丹加问题。他说，阻挠中央政府在加丹加恢复秩序的只是由于比利时军队驻在加丹加和一些西方国家支持比利时及傀儡冲伯。
    卢蒙巴指出，刚果中央政府将恢复加丹加的秩序，因为绝大多数人民拥护中央政府，而冲伯的掌权仅仅是靠着比利时的刺刀。
    卢蒙巴在谈到刚果国内经济问题时说，比利时的武装干涉破坏了我们的经济计划的实现，如果没有比利时挑衅性的武装干涉，我们就不会遭到这样巨大的困难。
    卢蒙巴指出，比利时军队撤出刚果就会为全国经济生活的正常化打下基础。
    卢蒙巴在谈到联合国在刚果的作用时，认为安全理事会决议有它的积极意义，它使得比利时军队开始撤出刚果领土。
    他强调指出，但是，我国人民和国际舆论应该警惕地注视着安理会决议今后的执行情况，因为某些西方人士企图利用联合国达到自己的目的。
    刚果共和国政府25日发表一项公报说：“比利时殖民主义者仍然企图再次插手干涉我国。这一帝国主义阴谋并非虚构的。证明这一点的证据越来越多。”
    公报说，“在国际帝国主义黑暗势力的支持下，比利时把年青的刚果共和国引入困难的境地，面临这种严重的困难，刚果人民认为自己主要的任务是团结和联合全国一切反殖民主义力量。”
    卢蒙巴在电台对刚果全国人民讲话时说：“昨天被压迫的刚果人，今天把自己国家的命运掌握在自己手里。剥夺他们祖国的独立已经成为不可能。但是，只有我国人民的团结一致，才能保持这种独立。国际帝国主义想在刚果恢复殖民主义的企图将注定要破产”。
