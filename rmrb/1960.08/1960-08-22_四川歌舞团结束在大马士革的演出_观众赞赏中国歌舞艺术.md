Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 20th: The Chinese Sichuan Song and Dance Troupe concluded its performances here this evening.

After the final performance, Mr. Dala, General Manager of the 7th Damascus International Fair, went on stage again to express his gratitude.

During its nine-day stay in Damascus, the Sichuan Song and Dance Troupe performed a total of five shows in the theater of the fair, attracting more than 8,000 spectators from the Syrian and Egyptian regions of the United Arab Republic, as well as Lebanon, Jordan, and other countries.

The performances of the song and dance troupe were very successful. Almost every program received enthusiastic applause from the audience. Arab friends were particularly interested in traditional Chinese folk dances and music. Many Arab housewives, who usually do not appear in public places and wear black veils, also rushed to the theater to enjoy the performances.

The audience expressed friendly feelings towards the Chinese people and respect for the great leader of China, Chairman Mao. An old Syrian woman, who had visited China as a peace fighter, said to her Chinese friend in Chinese after watching the performance: "Long live Chairman Mao!" A Syrian youth who visited China in 1957 made a special trip from Hama in northern Syria on the 19th to watch the performance. When he heard Chinese musicians sing "The Great Mao Zedong," he softly sang along in Chinese. An old Syrian painter brought a painting of "Lion Dance" that he painted while watching the performance, along with a box of Arab pastries, to the Chinese staff of the Chinese pavilion at the fair, expressing his appreciation for the wonderful performance of the Chinese artists and his friendship with the Chinese people.

    四川歌舞团结束在大马士革的演出
    观众赞赏中国歌舞艺术
    新华社大马士革20日电　中国四川歌舞团今天晚间结束了在这里的演出。
    在最后一场演出结束后，第七届大马士革国际博览会总经理达拉提到台上去再次表示感谢。
    四川歌舞团在这里停留九天期间，在博览会的剧场共演出了五场，观众有八千多人，他们来自阿联叙利亚地区和埃及地区以及黎巴嫩、约旦等国。
    歌舞团的演出非常成功。几乎每一个节目都受到观众的热烈鼓掌。阿拉伯朋友们对中国传统的民间舞蹈和音乐特别感到兴趣。平时不在公共场所露面的许多罩着黑面纱的阿拉伯家庭妇女也争先恐后地前往剧场欣赏。
    观众们对中国人民表示友好的感情，对中国伟大的领袖毛主席表示敬意。曾经作为和平战士访问过中国的一位叙利亚老太太在观看演出后用中文对她的中国朋友说：
  “毛主席万岁”。在1957年访问过中国的一位叙利亚青年19日特地从叙利亚北部的哈马赶来观看演出，当他听到中国音乐家演唱“伟大的毛泽东”这首歌时，他也轻轻地用中文和唱。有一位叙利亚老画家把他在观看“狮舞”时画的一幅“狮舞”的画和一盒阿拉伯点心带去送给博览会中国馆的中国工作人员，表示他很欣赏中国艺术家的精采表演和他对中国人民的友情。
