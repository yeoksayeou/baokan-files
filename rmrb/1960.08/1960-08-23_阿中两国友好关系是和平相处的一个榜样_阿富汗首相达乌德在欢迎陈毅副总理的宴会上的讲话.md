Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, August 22nd—Afghan Prime Minister Sardar Mohammad Daud delivered a speech yesterday at a banquet held here in honor of Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China. The full text is as follows: Your Excellency, our distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:

Your Excellency's presence at this friendly gathering gives me the opportunity to once again express my heartfelt gratitude for your visit to our country and to welcome Your Excellency and your companions as our esteemed guests.

The friendly relations that currently exist between Afghanistan and China stem from long-standing interactions within a complete friendship that has continued throughout history. In the past, this cultural and commercial connection was established through the famous "Silk Road." But now, our friendly relations with the new China, built on the solid foundation of ancient exchanges, have been further strengthened by the strong qualities of mutual friendship, goodwill, and respect that exist between the two friendly neighbors.

I am pleased to say that this bond of friendship and amity has been further strengthened by Mr. Zhou Enlai's visit to Afghanistan, cultural exchanges established through reciprocal cultural and educational delegations, and visits to our friendly neighbor, the People's Republic of China, by myself and Foreign Minister Sardar Mohammad Naim. Your Excellency's current visit to our country, despite the hardship, is another symbol of the goodwill and common desire to promote and consolidate this friendly relationship.

Although the social and economic lives of our two peoples differ, the good relations between Afghanistan and China continue, which is a remarkable example of mutual understanding, a strong belief in friendship between peoples and nations, and a desire for peaceful coexistence for the benefit of world peace and international cooperation.

My visit to your great and beautiful country, and the opportunity given to me to meet the Chinese people, have left pleasant memories in my heart, which I will always cherish. Meetings with Mr. Mao Zedong, Mr. Zhou Enlai, as well as with Your Excellency and other leaders of your great country, gave me great pleasure. I am now very happy to meet with you again - this time in friendly Afghanistan - and relive these pleasant memories. It gives me extra pleasure to see that Your Excellency is now taking the time to establish close ties with your friendly neighbor and its people - a neighbor and its people who have maintained friendly and harmonious relations with the Chinese people since ancient times.

During my stay in your country, I personally witnessed the efforts made by your people to build their motherland. The progress and achievements made by your country in such a short period of time, thanks to the efforts of the Chinese government and people, are not only commendable but also pleasing to your friends. Among these achievements in many areas of endeavor, the most notable is the spirit of your people's determination to solve and overcome their difficulties. The determination and efforts shown by the Chinese people in building their country are highly valued by our people. Our people are busy making up for the losses and damages suffered by them in their unremitting struggle to defend their independence. We hope to accomplish this task in an atmosphere of world peace and tranquility. Therefore, our people are striving to seize this opportunity and devote their energies to developing their economic and social life and improving their living standards. The determination and efforts of our people, coupled with the selfless assistance given by several friendly countries, will undoubtedly bring us closer to achieving these goals. Afghanistan believes that world peace is the pillar on which its national and international policies are based, and it seeks to achieve this ideal by adhering to a policy of neutrality and non-participation in military blocs. This policy is aimed at seeking friendship and promoting friendly cooperation for the benefit of world peace. Afghanistan's belief in the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Bandung Declaration is based on the above principles.

In order to strengthen the Bandung spirit and its lofty ideals, especially when the world is in turmoil and there is a greater need for mutual understanding and the elimination of differences, Asian and African countries must strengthen cooperation.

The current world is suffering from a series of international difficulties, which are causing greater anxiety and dissatisfaction. This tension, which threatens the survival of mankind, convinces us more than ever of the value and effect of mutual understanding and respect for the stability of the world and genuine peace. We hope that those who bear responsibility in the world will recognize this fact and make efforts to achieve these goals.

Valued guest, your arrival at a time when our people are celebrating a major national holiday, and the fact that Your Excellency is celebrating this holiday with our people, is of particular significance. Therefore, I would like to express the gratitude of the Afghan people and government to Your Excellency. I hope that Your Excellency and your distinguished companions will have a pleasant short stay among your Afghan friends and will help to strengthen the friendship and understanding between the Afghan and Chinese peoples.

Ladies and gentlemen,

I hope you will join me in a toast:

To the health of our esteemed guest, Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister of our friendly neighbor, the People's Republic of China!

To the health of Chairman Mao Zedong!

To the health of Chairman Liu Shaoqi!

To the prosperity and happiness of the Chinese people!

To the eternal friendship between Afghanistan and China!

To world peace and prosperity!

    阿中两国友好关系是和平相处的一个榜样
    阿富汗首相达乌德在欢迎陈毅副总理的宴会上的讲话
    新华社喀布尔22日电　阿富汗首相萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德昨天在这里为中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅举行的宴会上发表了讲话，全文如下：阁下，我们的贵宾们，诸位阁下，女士们和先生们：
    阁下光临这个友好的聚会，使我有机会再一次地为您这次对我国的访问向您表示我的衷心的感谢，并欢迎作为我们的尊敬的客人的阁下和您的同伴们。
    目前存在于阿富汗和中国之间的友好关系出自在整个历史上连绵不断的完满友谊中长期存在的交往。在过去，这种文化和商业上的联系，是经过著名的“丝绸之路”建立起来的。但是现在，建立在古老的交往的牢固基础上的、我们同新中国的友好关系，由于存在于两个友好的邻国之间的相互友谊、善意和尊重的坚强的素质而得到进一步的加强。
    我高兴地说，这种友好与友谊的联系，已经由于周恩来先生阁下访问阿富汗，通过互派文化和教育代表团而建立的文化交流，以及我本人和外交大臣萨达尔·穆罕默德·纳伊姆对我们的友好的邻邦中华人民共和国的访问而得到了进一步的加强。阁下现在不辞辛苦地访问我国，是促进和巩固这种友好关系的善意和共同愿望的另一个象征。
    尽管我们两国人民的社会和经济生活有所不同，阿富汗和中国之间的良好关系仍然在继续下去，这是相互谅解、对于人民和民族之间的友谊的坚强信念以及为了世界和平和国际合作的利益而和平相处的愿望的一个卓越的榜样。
    我对您的伟大而美丽的国家的访问，以及给予我的同中国人民会面的机会，在我心中留下了愉快的回忆，我将永远珍视这些回忆。同毛泽东先生阁下、周恩来先生阁下以及同阁下和伟大的贵国的其他领导人的会晤，使我深感愉快。我现在非常高兴地再一次地同您会见——这一次在友好的阿富汗——并重温这些愉快的回忆。看到阁下现在腾出时间来同您的友好的邻国及其人民——这个邻邦及其人民自古以来同中国人民一直保持着友好与和睦的联系——建立亲密的交往，这使我格外感到高兴。
    我在贵国逗留期间，我亲自看到贵国人民为了建设自己的祖国而作出的努力。由于中国政府和人民所作的努力，贵国在短短的时期内所取得的进步和成就，不仅是值得赞扬的，而且使你们的朋友们感到喜悦。在作出努力的许多方面所取得的这些成就之中，最显著的是贵国人民决心解决和克服自己的困难的精神。中国人民为了建设自己的国家所表现的决心和作出的努力，受到我国人民的极大的重视。我国人民正忙于弥补他们为了保卫自己的独立进行不懈斗争而遭受的损失和破坏。我们希望在世界和平和安宁的气氛中来完成这个任务。所以，我国人民正在力求利用这个机会，并把自己的精力用在发展自己的经济和社会生活以及改善自己的生活水平方面。我国人民的决心和努力，加上若干友好国家所给予的无私援助，无疑将使我们更加接近于达到这些目标。阿富汗认为，世界和平是它的国家和国际政策所依据的支柱，它要通过恪守中立和不参加军事集团的政策来争取实现这个理想。这个政策是为了争取友谊并为了世界和平的利益，促进友好合作。阿富汗对联合国宪章和万隆宣言的原则的信念，是以上述原则为依据的。
    为了加强万隆精神和它的崇高的理想，特别是在世界处于动荡状态而更加需要互相谅解和消除分歧的时候，亚非国家必须加强合作。
    目前的世界遭受着一系列的国际上的困难，这种困难引起更大的不安和不满。威胁人类的生存的这种紧张状态比以往任何时候更加使我们坚信，为了世界的稳定和真正的和平而互相谅解和尊重的价值和效果。我们希望在世界上承担着责任的人们认识到这个事实，并为达到这些目的而作出努力。
    珍贵的客人，您在我国人民庆祝全国重大节日的时候到来，而且阁下同我们全国人民一起欢庆这个节日，是有特别重大意义的。因此，我愿向阁下表达阿富汗人民和政府的感谢。我希望，阁下和您的杰出的同伴们在你们的阿富汗朋友中间作短暂的逗留时将感到愉快。并将有助于加强阿富汗人民和中国人民之间的友谊和谅解。
    诸位阁下，女士们和先生们，
    我希望你们同我一起为我们的尊敬的客人，我们友好的邻邦中华人民共和国的副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅的健康，
    为毛泽东主席的健康，
    为刘少奇主席的健康，
    为中国人民的昌盛和幸福，
    为阿富汗和中国之间的万古长青的友谊，
    为世界和平和繁荣昌盛，
    而干杯！
