    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 1st. The total industrial output value of the German Democratic Republic increased by 10% in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. The labor productivity of socialist industrial workers increased by 9%.

    This was announced in the communiqué on the implementation of the national economic plan for the first half of 1960, released here on July 31 by the State Central Bureau of Statistics.

    The communiqué stated that the production of many important industries in the first half of 1960 was good. The production of iron and steel reached over 978,000 tons and 1,638,000 tons respectively, representing an increase of 4% and 3% respectively compared with the same period last year. Cement increased by 48% compared with the same period last year, agricultural machinery increased by 20%, and phosphate fertilizer increased by 15%. The production of consumer goods also increased.

    The communiqué said that in the first half of this year, the working people made fruitful efforts to improve the level of science and technology, and more and more new products appeared in production. In the centrally led machine-building industry, about 900 newly designed products started production in the first half of this year, an increase of one-third compared with the same period last year.

    The communiqué pointed out that the number of people participating in labor emulation within various enterprises increased in the first half of this year. In June, 86.3% of industrial workers participated in socialist emulation. More than 120,000 production teams (a total of more than 1.5 million people) participated in the movement to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team". The number of "Socialist Labor and Research Collectives" reached 36,000, with a total of approximately 300,000 workers, technicians, engineers, and scientists.

    In terms of investment, the communiqué stated that the total investment in the state-owned economic sector increased by 8% compared to the first half of last year.

    In agriculture, complete agricultural collectivization was achieved in the first half of this year, with a total of 950,000 cooperative farmers. The crop harvest prospects for this year are good.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 3rd. According to the communiqué on the implementation of the national economic plan for the first half of this year, released by the Czechoslovak State Bureau of Statistics, Czechoslovakia's total industrial output value increased by 11.8% compared with the same period last year, while the output value of the machinery manufacturing industry increased by 16.9%.

    The fuel industry completed 102.6% of the plan, and electricity production increased by 12% compared with the same period last year, with a total of 12 billion kilowatt-hours generated. The production of the metallurgical industry and the Ministry of Mining increased by 11.4%. The chemical industry also overfulfilled its plan, with an increase of 13.4% compared with the first half of 1959. In the machine-building and metal processing industries, the output of metallurgical plant equipment increased by nearly 40%. Consumer goods production increased by 7.9%.

    The amount of capital construction in the first half of this year increased by 15.1% compared with the same period last year; especially in the fuel and power industries, the half-year plan has been greatly overfulfilled.

    Compared with the first half of last year, the volume of foreign trade increased by 17.6%.

    This year, unified agricultural cooperatives cultivate 67% of the country's agricultural land. At present, the socialist component in agriculture accounts for 86.4% of the total agricultural land.

    The basic construction of unified agricultural cooperatives increased by 27% compared with the first half of last year.

    A total of 74,000 hectares of forest were planted in the first half of this year, completing nearly 84% of the annual plan.

    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 31st. Workers in various parts of the German Democratic Republic are vigorously launching a movement to save raw materials.

    Not long ago, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany called on workers and technicians across the country to launch a comprehensive movement to save raw materials, especially to save and rationally utilize steel and wood, in all sectors of the national economy. This call received a warm response from workers across the country and achieved preliminary results in saving raw materials.

    Workers and technicians at the machine manufacturing factories in Magdeburg have put forward a total of 1,136 saving measures, which, when fully implemented, can save 12.34 million marks. By the beginning of July, they had already saved 5 million marks. Designers at the Lauchhammer Heavy Machinery Plant in Cottbus decided to save a large amount of raw materials by improving designs, reducing machine weight, and minimizing the use of high-quality steel. Workers in the Halle district, which is centered on the chemical industry, saved raw materials worth 40 million marks in June alone. Workers at the Wartburg Automobile Factory aim to save 20 kilograms of steel per vehicle within this year.

    Socialist labor teams and socialist research collectives played a significant role in the movement. Among the 1,136 guarantees in the machine manufacturing factories in Magdeburg, 986 were collective guarantees. Many new designs were successfully researched and tested in research collectives or labor teams. "Economical use of materials" has become one of the main contents of their labor emulation campaigns.

    Currently, this movement is continuing to develop in depth.

    德捷发表上半年经济计划执行公报
    德国各地职工蓬勃展开节约原材料运动
    新华社柏林1日电　德意志民主共和国今年上半年工业总产值比去年同期增加了10％。社会主义工业工人劳动生产率提高了9％。
    这是7月31日在这里发表的国家中央统计局关于1960年上半年国民经济计划执行情况的公报中所宣布的。
    公报说，1960年上半年许多重要工业生产情况良好。铁和钢分别达到九十七万八千多吨和一百六十三万八千多吨，较去年同期分别增加4％和3％。水泥较去年同期增加48％，农业机器增加20％，磷肥增加15％。消费品的生产也增加了。
    公报说，今年上半年劳动人民为提高科学技术水平进行了有成效的努力，在生产中出现了越来越多的新产品。在中央领导的机器制造工业中，今年上半年约有九百种新设计的产品开始生产，比去年同期增加三分之一。
    公报指出，今年上半年各个企业内部参加劳动竞赛的人数有了增加。在6月份，有86.3％的产业工人参加了社会主义竞赛。有十二万多个生产队（共一百五十多万人）参加了争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的运动。“社会主义劳动和研究集体”达到了三万六千个，这些集体共有工人、技术员、工程师和科学家约三十万人。
    在投资方面，公报说，国营经济部门投资总额比去年上半年增加8％。
    在农业方面，今年上半年实现了农业全部合作化，合作社农民共有九十五万人。今年农作物收成前景良好。

    新华社柏林31日电　德意志民主共和国各地职工在蓬勃展开一个节约原材料的运动。
    不久前，德国统一社会党中央委员会曾号召全国工人和技术人员在国民经济各部门展开一个全面的节约原材料，特别是节约和合理运用钢材和木材的运动。这一号召得到了全国职工的热烈响应，并在节约原材料方面取得了初步成就。
    马格德堡各机器制造厂的工人和技术人员共提出了一千一百三十六项节约措施，这些措施全部实现后可节约一千二百三十四万马克，到7月初为止，他们已经节约了五百万马克。科特布斯市劳赫汗麦尔重型机械厂的设计师们决定通过改进设计、减少机器自重和尽量少用优质钢的办法大量节约原材料。以化学工业为中心的哈雷专区的职工们仅在6月份就节约了价值四千万马克的原材料。瓦德堡汽车制造厂的工人要在今年内达到每辆车节约二十公斤钢材的指标。
    社会主义劳动队和社会主义研究集体在运动中起了很大的作用。在马格德堡各机器制造厂的一千一百三十六项保证中，有九百八十六项是集体保证。许多新设计是在研究集体或劳动队中研究试验成功的。“经济使用材料”成为他们开展劳动竞赛的主要内容之一。
    目前这个运动正在继续深入地发展着。
