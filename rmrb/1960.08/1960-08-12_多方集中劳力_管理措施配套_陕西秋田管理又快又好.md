    Concentrating Labor from Various Sources, Supporting Management Measures
    Shaanxi's Autumn Field Management is Fast and Good
    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, 11th dispatch) Shaanxi Province, based on the characteristics of this year's large autumn field area, heavy field management work, and the concentration of various tasks, has vigorously tapped labor potential from various aspects, changed field management methods, and improved labor efficiency, greatly accelerating the progress of autumn field management work.
    Although Shaanxi Province suffered a major drought this year, the province's autumn planting area still exceeded the original plan. However, since most of the autumn fields were planted against drought, the task of seedling management is large, and the labor required is also more than in previous years. In response to this situation, Party committees at all levels have tried every means to tap labor potential and strengthen autumn field management. Generally, the measures taken are: drawing labor from farmland capital construction, implementing women replacing men and the weak replacing the strong in some work, mobilizing all walks of life to draw a certain amount of labor to support agricultural production, and mobilizing students on vacation to support agriculture. Various localities have also readjusted labor organizations according to the characteristics of agricultural work and the strength and skill levels of laborers, improving labor efficiency. Xi'an suburban areas and its four directly subordinate counties, which are doing a better job, drew 160,000 laborers from community-run industries, welfare services, and students returning home during the summer vacation from July 28 to August 3, making the field management labor force double to more than triple the number before July 28, significantly improving the progress of autumn field management work. The city has a total of more than 2.2 million mu of autumn fields, completing more than 1.5 million mu of inter-row cultivation and weeding, more than 310,000 mu of top dressing, and more than 250,000 mu of pest and disease control; the city's 600,000 mu of cotton has been generally cultivated one to two times. Xingping County adopted the above methods and drew more than 70,000 laborers, together with the original 180,000 laborers, a total of more than 250,000 laborers were put into the field management campaign, and the daily progress of various field management tasks increased by one time compared with the past. Yan'an County, as a result of tapping labor from all aspects, put 90% of the labor force into the field management campaign, and various management tasks were faster and better than in previous years. For example, the inter-row cultivation and weeding work has increased sharply from the past progress of more than 11,400 mu to more than 32,600 mu.
    This year, due to the long-term drought, the inter-row cultivation and weeding, soil building, moisture conservation, fertilizer accumulation, top dressing, pruning, and pest and disease control of autumn fields are very concentrated, and the workload is also greater than in previous years. According to this new situation, various localities have adopted the methods of "complete management" and "comprehensive management," such as water, fertilizer, weeding, and conservation all coming together, which not only meets the needs of autumn crops for growth, but also improves the efficiency of field management work. The members of the communes in Bin County and Qian County on the Weibei Loess Plateau all go to the fields with several tools such as hoes, pesticide equipment, and fertilizer bags, so that weeding is combined with fertilizer accumulation, pruning is combined with pest control, and irrigation is combined with inter-row cultivation, and soil building is combined with fertilization. After the members of Shide Commune in Qian County adopted these methods, the efficiency of autumn field management work increased by one to two times compared with the past, achieving timely management and ensuring the quality of various management tasks.
    This year, Shaanxi Province's autumn crops were all planted to resist drought, and many autumn fields were replanted once to several times. Therefore, in some places, autumn seedlings of different sizes and different crop varieties appear in the same field, and the management requirements are also different. In response to this new situation, various localities generally adopt the method of starting at the same time and treating them separately, achieving skillful management and careful management. Yaocheng Commune in Tongchuan City has reformulated field management measures based on the new situation of autumn seedling growth this year. For example, top dressing not only ensures the quantity and quality of top dressing, but also applies fertilizer separately according to the needs of autumn seedlings: quick-acting fertilizers for promoting seedling growth are applied to small seedlings and weak seedlings, nitrogen fertilizers for attacking stalks and leaves are applied to autumn seedlings at the jointing stage, and phosphorus fertilizers for attacking ears and grains are applied to autumn seedlings at the heading stage.
    At present, under the careful management of the broad masses, most of the autumn crops in the province are growing well, and early corn and millet have begun to head; late autumn crops are also growing with thick stalks and luxuriant leaves, tender green and strong. (Attached photo)

    多方集中劳力　管理措施配套
    陕西秋田管理又快又好
    本报西安11日电　陕西省各地根据今年秋田面积大、田间管理工作任务重，以及各项活路集中等特点，经多方面挖掘劳动力潜力，改变田间管理工作方法，提高劳动效率，大大加快了秋田管理工作的进度。
    今年陕西省虽然遭遇大旱，全省秋田播种面积仍然超过了原订计划。但由于大部分秋田是抗旱播种的，苗期管理任务大，所需要的劳动力也比往年多。针对这一情况，各级党委都千方百计地挖掘劳动潜力，加强了秋田管理工作。一般的都采取了：从农田基本建设方面抽调，有些工作实行以女代男、以弱代强，同时动员各行各业抽调一定的劳力支援农业生产，动员假期中的学生支援农业等办法。各地还根据农活的特点和劳力强弱、技术高低等情况，重新调整劳动组织，提高了劳动效率。搞得较好的西安市郊区和四个直属县，从7月28日到8月3日，从社办工业、生活福利以及暑期返乡的学生中，抽调了十六万劳力，使田间管理的劳力较28日前增加一倍到三倍以上，显著的提高了秋田管理工作的进度。全市共二百二十万多亩秋田，完成中耕锄草的一百五十多万亩、追肥三十一万多亩、防治病虫害二十五万多亩；全市六十万亩棉花普遍地中耕一到二次。兴平县采取上述办法，抽调了七万多名劳动力，连同原有十八万劳动力，共二十五万多劳力投入田间管理运动，各项田间管理工作日进度比过去增加了一倍。延安县从各方面挖掘劳力的结果，使90％的劳力投入田间管理运动，各项管理工作都较往年又快又好。例如：中耕锄草工作就由过去的进度一万一千四百多亩，猛增到三万二千六百多亩。
    今年由于长期干旱，秋田的中耕锄草、培土、保墒、积肥和施追肥、整枝以及防治病虫害等工作十分集中，工作量也较往年大。各地根据这一新情况，采用了“管理配套”、“综合管理”等水、肥、锄、保一齐来的办法，既满足秋田作物生长的需要，又提高了田间管理工作的效率。渭北高塬上的邠县、乾县各公社的社员下地都带着锄头、药械和化肥袋等几种器具，使锄草结合积肥，整枝结合治虫、灌溉结合中耕，培土结合施肥。乾县史德公社的社员采用这些办法后，秋田管理工作效率较过去提高了一倍到二倍，做到适时管理并且保证了各项管理工作的质量。
    今年，陕西省的秋作物都是抗旱播种的，很多秋田经过一次到几次补种。因此，有些地方在同一块田里出现秋苗大小不一，作物品种不同的情况，对管理的要求也就不同。各地针对这一新的情况，一般都采取同时动手，分别对待的方法，做到了巧管、细管。铜川市耀城公社根据今年秋苗生长的新情况，重新制定了田间管理措施，例如施追肥不仅保证追肥的数量多和质量高，而且根据秋苗的需要分别施肥：对小苗和弱苗施催苗的速效肥，拔节的秋苗施攻秆攻叶的氮肥，吐穗的秋苗追施攻穗攻粒的磷肥。
    目前，在广大群众的精心管理下，全省大部分秋季作物生长良好，早玉米和糜谷都已开始抽穗；晚秋作物也都生长得秆粗叶茂，嫩绿茁壮。（附图片）
