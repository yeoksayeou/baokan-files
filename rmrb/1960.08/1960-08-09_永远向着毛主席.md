    Forever Facing Chairman Mao
      [Three Tibetan Folk Songs]
    Whether it's windy or rainy,
    Even if the sky is cloudy or snowy,
    The top of the Jokhang Temple,
    Is always sparkling!
    Whether it's a thousand hardships,
    Even if it's a thousand difficulties,
    The hearts of the Tibetan people,
    Forever face Chairman Mao!
        Dreaming and Singing
    With the sun,
    The snow mountains gleam with silver light;
    With the moon,
    The road is bright.
    With Chairman Mao,
    The grass is green, the water is sweet, and the cattle and sheep are strong;
    With the Communist Party,
    We are singing even in our dreams!
        Vigilance
    Snake skin is beautiful,
    But it has poisonous fangs!
    The conch shell is pretty,
    But the inside is winding!
    Today's chieftain is very amiable,
    But he hides a knife in his bosom!
    Brothers who have been emancipated,
    You must always keep your eyes wide open!

    永远向着毛主席
      〔藏族民歌三首〕
    不论是刮风、下雨，
    哪怕你天阴、落雪，
    大金寺的塔顶呵，
    永久是亮晶晶的！
    不论是千辛、万苦，
    哪怕你千难、万难，
    藏族人民的心呵，
    永远向着毛主席！
        梦中也在歌唱
    有太阳，
    雪山闪银光；
    有月亮，
    道路亮堂堂。
    有毛主席，
    草青、水甜、牛羊肥壮；
    有共产党，
    我们在梦中也在歌唱！
        警惕
    蛇皮很美丽，
    但是它有毒牙齿！
    海螺很漂亮，
    但是肚子里弯弯曲曲！
    今天的头人很和气，
    但是怀里揣着刀子！
    翻了身的农奴兄弟呵，
    你随时要睁大眼睛！
