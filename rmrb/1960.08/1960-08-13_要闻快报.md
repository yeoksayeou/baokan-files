    More than 30,000 Cadres in Zhejiang Go to the Grassroots to Lead the Summer Harvest and Planting
    More than 36,000 cadres at all levels in Zhejiang Province went deep into the grassroots, carried forward the "Four Togetherness" style, and earnestly grasped ideology, production, and life, which powerfully promoted the summer harvest and planting. After the responsible comrades of the Wenzhou Prefectural Committee of the CPC and the Pingyang County Committee went to the Shuita Production Team of the Wanquan Commune, they harvested rice with the commune members and discussed matters together. They promptly summarized and promoted the team's experience of harvesting early rice at "80% maturity," which greatly accelerated the harvest progress and significantly improved the harvest quality in the entire area.

    Laozhaozhuang Commune Implements a Combination of Labor, Leisure, and Study System
    The Laozhaozhuang People's Commune in Linqing City, Shandong Province, implements a "two, four, eight, ten" combination system of labor, leisure, and study.

    The "two, four, eight, ten" combination system of labor, leisure, and study means two hours of study, four hours for meals and rest, eight hours of sleep, and ten hours of labor during busy farming seasons. This system was formulated by the commune in the second half of last year based on the Party's instructions to care for the lives of the masses. Since its implementation, the results have been very good. Because the commune members are healthy, the labor attendance rate of the commune members still reached more than 96% during this summer.

    Shenyang Launches a Propaganda Campaign to Support Agriculture
    Shenyang City launched an in-depth propaganda and education campaign on "Agriculture is the Foundation of the National Economy" to mobilize the whole Party and the whole people to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

    Currently, this propaganda and education campaign has entered a climax. In every corner of the city and countryside, people can be heard talking about agriculture, basically achieving universal awareness.

    Through this propaganda and education campaign, the broad masses of workers and staff have received profound ideological education, generally recognizing the importance of supporting agriculture, and turning support for agriculture into conscious action. Under the slogan of "Everyone does one or several good things for agriculture," the workers of the Sino-Czech Friendship Factory recovered more than 500 tons of various waste steel in a few days and used this batch of old steel to produce ten machine tools to support agricultural technological transformation.

    Rural Areas of Tibet Establish Busy Season Childcare Organizations
    Farmers in Tibet are actively establishing childcare groups during the busy farming season so that women can get rid of the burden of children and happily participate in agricultural production.

    As of the end of July, the agricultural production mutual aid teams in Jiacha County had organized 148 family and field childcare groups. After the Dongfanghong Mutual Aid Team of Jiefang Township in Gyangze County organized a temporary busy season childcare group, women, who account for more than 50% of the labor force, are more at ease in production and their enthusiasm has doubled. Originally, ten people could hoe ten *ke* of land in a day, but now they can hoe fifteen to twenty *ke*. (*Translator's note: A 'ke' is likely a unit of area.*)

    Hunan Women's Federation Organizes Women to Go to the Countryside to Impart Technology
    In order to encourage women to learn advanced technologies and use new tools, and to give full play to women's active role in the "Double Rush" battle, the Hunan Provincial Women's Federation organized a women's "Three Machines" (rice reaper, rice thresher, rice transplanter) promotion team to conduct live demonstrations in the Chen County area, where early rice matures earlier in the province.

    The activities of the promotion team greatly promoted the upsurge of learning and promoting new tools among the broad masses of women. After seeing the performance, Wen Youfen, the women's director of the Shaxi Brigade of the Chengnan Commune in Yizhang County, rushed back to the brigade that night to teach the techniques to the students in the "Three Hands" (rice transplanter operator, rice reaper operator, rice thresher operator) training class.

    Chongqing Children Carry Out Scientific and Technological Research Activities on a Large Scale
    Chongqing's children are carrying out scientific and technological research activities in full swing.

    According to incomplete statistics, in the past month or so, children in primary and secondary schools throughout the city have successively established more than 300 various scientific and technological research organizations, with nearly 200,000 children participating in group activities.

    After participating in scientific and technological research activities, children's ability to apply knowledge has generally been strengthened. They not only established juvenile weather stations, reporting the weather to the commune's management districts and production teams every day as a reference for guiding agricultural activities, but also used their knowledge to create "chemical rain gauges," "string rain gauges," and other local methods of forecasting instruments to master climate change.
