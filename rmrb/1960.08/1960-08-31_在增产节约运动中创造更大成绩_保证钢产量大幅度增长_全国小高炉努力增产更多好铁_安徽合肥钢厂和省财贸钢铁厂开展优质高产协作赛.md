Xinhua News Agency, August 30th: Small blast furnace ironmaking workers throughout the country are adopting various measures in the increase production and practice economy movement to produce more high-quality iron to support key steelmaking enterprises. According to incomplete statistics, since August, the quality of pig iron in more than a dozen provinces and autonomous regions, including Fujian, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, and Guangxi, has been further improved compared to July.

The improvement of the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces in various regions is being carried out in the following aspects: educating workers to establish an overall view of quality and high yield; strengthening raw material management and improving raw material quality; implementing the operating methods of "fine materials, high blast, high temperature"; establishing and improving the laboratory system and strengthening quality inspection, etc. Among them, Hebei Province has the best measures, so the quality of pig iron has also improved relatively quickly.

The measures taken by Hebei Province to improve the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces are:

First, educate leading cadres of various ironmaking enterprises to establish an overall view of quality and high yield. To this end, the Hebei Provincial Metallurgical Department has organized Party committee secretaries of ironmaking plants in batches to visit steel plants and hold discussions, deeply recognizing the importance of supplying high-quality pig iron to steel plants.

Second, mobilize workers to launch a mass movement to inspect the quality of pig iron, pool ideas, and encircle and annihilate sulfur. The main goal is to implement the principle of "fine materials," reduce the sulfur content of raw materials, let the blast furnace eat "refined grains" and "cooked materials," and try to eliminate sulfur outside the blast furnace. The Provincial Party Committee stipulates that coking coal must not be put into the coking furnace without washing, and if it is not washed well, it must be rewashed. Mining enterprises have established a system of everyone checking and setting up checkpoints at all levels before the ore enters the factory. Ore with low iron content is not mined, ore with poor quality is not roasted, ore that does not meet the standards is not crushed, and ore containing impurities is not loaded. The ore entering the ironmaking plant must pass "five checkpoints" before entering the furnace (that is, roasting to remove sulfur, crushing, screening, weighing, and quantitative charging), eliminate "four pests" (mud, soil, powder, and impurities), implement particle size classification, quality classification, mixed storage, and establish a laboratory supervision system.

Third, in addition to grasping "fine materials," implement the technical policy of "high blast, high temperature." To this end, various regions are accelerating the manufacture and increase of blowers for small blast furnaces, improving the structure of hot blast stoves, promoting advanced experience, and educating workers on technical operating procedures.

Fourth, organized nine working groups, led by leading cadres, to go to key iron-producing areas such as Handan, Baoding, and Chengde to help enterprises improve the quality of pig iron.

This year, the output of pig iron from small blast furnaces in my country accounts for a large proportion of the total national pig iron output. Continuously improving the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces while continuously increasing the output of pig iron from small blast furnaces is very important for improving the national steel output and mechanical casting production. In order to improve the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has held special meetings and sent working groups to ironmaking enterprises in key iron-producing provinces such as Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Shandong, Hunan, and Sichuan to assist in the work. The metallurgical departments of various provinces and regions have also recently listed this work as a central task.

(Our newspaper, Hefei, August 30th) Hefei Steel Plant in Anhui Province and the Provincial Finance and Trade Steel Plant have launched a collaboration competition for high quality and high yield. The Finance and Trade Steel Plant supplies good iron to the Hefei Steel Plant to make good steel, and the Hefei Steel Plant actively helps the Finance and Trade Steel Plant improve the quality of pig iron, so that the quality and output of steel and iron in the two plants are jointly improved. In July, the qualified rate of pig iron from the small blast furnace of the Finance and Trade Steel Plant increased from 60.54% in June to 90%, and the average utilization coefficient of the ten small blast furnaces remained stable above 2.7. The qualified rate of steel ingots in Hefei Steel Plant increased from 87% in June to 94.96%, the converter utilization coefficient increased more than doubled compared to June, and the pig iron consumption per ton of steel decreased by 8.9%.

In the previous period of this year, the Finance and Trade Steel Plant supplied a large amount of pig iron to the Hefei Steel Plant on time and in quantity, providing material conditions for the steel plant to continue to leap forward. However, these pig iron had a high sulfur content and many surface sand inclusions, which increased the difficulty of steelmaking. In response to this situation, the Party Committee of Hefei Steel Plant, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees, took the initiative to invite the Party Committee Secretary and Director of the Finance and Trade Steel Plant to hold a discussion in late June. Subsequently, the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees held a meeting of steel plants and iron plants in Hefei Steel Plant, emphasizing the importance of using good iron to make good steel. After the cadres of the two plants reached a consensus in their ideological understanding, they decided to carry out collaboration in terms of materials and technology, support each other, and promote each other. The steel plant promptly informed the iron plant of the sulfur content of the pig iron, and sent workshop directors, technicians, and chemists to the iron plant to understand the situation and help solve problems. The iron plant designated five blast furnaces to supply Hefei Steel Plant, stipulating that all the iron produced by the blast furnaces must be tested, and any unqualified iron must not be counted as production tasks, not allowed to leave the factory, and not allowed to be transferred out. At the same time, it organized furnace chiefs, technicians, and workers to visit the steel plant, so that they could actually understand the harm of high-sulfur pig iron to steelmaking.

With the promotion and help of Hefei Steel Plant, the Finance and Trade Steel Plant was determined to protect steel with good iron. The factory Party Committee first conducted a comprehensive inspection of the quality of pig iron, and launched discussions among all employees. At the same time, it held a three-way combination research meeting attended by leading cadres, technicians, and veteran workers, mobilized workers to analyze and study based on their own experiences, and looked for key points while proposing measures. Originally, the reason why the quality of pig iron in this plant had declined for a while, in addition to the one-sidedness in ideological understanding, was also due to: first, the quality index was not regarded as one of the contents of completing the task; second, after the technical transformation of the small blast furnace, some operating procedures and management systems could no longer adapt to the current production situation; third, the management of raw materials was relaxed, the ash content of the coke entering the furnace was high, and many high-sulfur ores were not picked out. The factory Party Committee took effective measures in response to the key points that had been found. It immediately transferred more than 90 cadres from the factory level and departments to workshops, blast furnaces, and teams to strengthen the front line of production, and established and improved a set of practical material yard management systems, insisting on using clean water to wash coal for coking, and stacking various coke and ores in grades, and entering the furnace after screening to reduce the sulfur content of the raw materials entering the furnace. In this way, all employees broke through one quality barrier after another in ironmaking in production, so that the quality of pig iron was rapidly improved.

The continuous improvement of the quality of pig iron greatly encouraged the workers of Hefei Steel Plant, and they were determined to refine good iron into good steel. Everyone was full of vigor and vitality, talking about measures and finding ideas everywhere, and solving one specific key problem after another. The molten iron melted by the pig iron furnace could not meet the needs of the converter for steelmaking, which became the weak link of the whole plant. The workers boldly changed the original ordinary pig iron furnace into a blast furnace type pig iron furnace, strengthened the blast, and adopted the new and effective experience from other places - alkaline pig iron furnace; at the same time, they actively improved the charging method of the pig iron furnace, ensuring that the pig iron furnace was full and not short of material, and quickly broke through the technical barrier of the pig iron furnace. Then, in response to the short furnace life of the converter, on the one hand, they improved it from all aspects of bricklaying, furnace building, and furnace baking; on the other hand, in response to the past three-shift operation and inconsistent three-shift management, they actively adjusted it, implemented checking various economic and technical indicators according to the furnace, and the workers' sense of responsibility was greatly strengthened; the furnace life was rapidly increased by more than one time.

    在增产节约运动中创造更大成绩　保证钢产量大幅度增长
    全国小高炉努力增产更多好铁
    安徽合肥钢厂和省财贸钢铁厂开展优质高产协作赛
    新华社30日讯　全国各地的小高炉炼铁职工，在增产节约运动中，采取各种措施，增产更多优质铁，支援重点炼钢企业。据不完全的统计，8月份以来，福建、河北、山西、山东、江苏、河南、广西等十几个省、自治区，生铁质量比7月份又有进一步提高。
    各地提高小高炉生铁的质量，是从以下几个方面进行的：教育职工树立优质、高产的全面观点；加强原料管理，提高原料质量；贯彻执行“精料、大风、高温”的操作方法；建立和健全化验制度，加强质量检查等。其中河北省的措施最好，因而生铁质量提高得也较快。
    河北省提高小高炉生铁质量所采取的措施是：
    一，教育各炼铁企业的领导干部树立优质、高产的全面观点。为此，河北省冶金厅曾经分批组织炼铁厂的党委书记到炼钢厂参观、访问并举行座谈，深刻认识以优质生铁供应炼钢厂的重要意义。
    二，发动职工展开了一个检查生铁质量的群众运动，群策群力，围歼硫磺。主要是贯彻执行“精料”的方针，减少原料的含硫量，让高炉吃“细粮”、吃“熟料”，尽量把硫磺消灭在高炉之外。省委规定：焦煤不洗不许入炼焦炉，洗得不好要重洗。采矿企业在矿石入厂前，建立了人人把关、层层设卡的制度，凡矿石含铁量不高的不开采，质量不好的不焙烧，不合标准的不破碎，含有杂质的不装车。进入炼铁厂的矿石在入炉前要过“五关”（即经过焙烧除硫、破碎、过筛、过磅和定量上料），除“四害”（泥、土、末、杂质），实行粒度分级、质量分类、混匀储存和建立化验监督制度。
    三，除抓“精料”外，贯彻执行“大风、高温”的技术方针。为此，各地正在为小高炉加速制造和增加鼓风机，改进热风炉的结构，推广先进经验和对工人进行技术操作规程的教育。
    四，组织了九个工作组，由领导干部率领，到邯郸、保定、承德等重点产铁区，帮助企业提高生铁质量。
    今年我国小高炉的生铁产量，在全国生铁总产量中占有很大比重。在不断地提高小高炉生铁产量的同时，不断地提高小高炉生铁的质量，这对提高全国钢产量和机械铸造生产有很重要的作用。为了提高小高炉生铁的质量，冶金工业部曾经专门召开会议，并且派出了工作组，深入到河北、河南、安徽、山东、湖南、四川等重点产铁省的炼铁企业，协助工作。各省、区的冶金部门，最近也都把这个工作列为一项中心任务。
    本报合肥30日电　安徽省合肥钢厂和省财贸钢铁厂开展了优质高产的协作赛，财贸钢铁厂以好铁供应合肥钢厂炼好钢，合肥钢厂则主动帮助财贸钢铁厂提高生铁质量，使两个厂的钢和铁的质量产量都获得共同提高。7月份，财贸钢铁厂小高炉的生铁合格率由6月份的60.54％提高到90％，十座小高炉的平均利用系数一直稳定在二点七以上。合肥钢厂的钢锭合格率从6月份的87％提高到94.96％，转炉利用系数比6月份提高一倍以上，每炼一吨钢耗用的生铁降低8.9％。
    今年前一时期，财贸钢铁厂虽然按时按量供应了合肥钢厂大批生铁，为钢厂继续跃进提供了物质条件。但是，这些生铁含硫较高，表面夹沙多，给炼钢增加了困难。针对这一情况，中共合肥钢厂党委根据省委、市委指示，在6月下旬主动邀请财贸钢铁厂党委书记、厂长进行座谈。接着，省委和市委又在合肥钢厂召开了钢厂和铁厂的会议，强调了用好铁对炼好钢的重要意义。两个厂干部在思想认识取得一致之后，决定从物质、技术等方面开展协作，相互支援，相互促进，钢厂及时把生铁含硫情况告诉铁厂，派车间主任、技术员、化验员到铁厂了解情况，帮助解决问题；铁厂划定五座高炉供应合肥钢厂，规定全部高炉生产的铁，必须经过化验，凡是不合格的，一律不计算产量任务，不准出厂、不许外调。同时，组织炉长、技术员、工人到钢厂参观，让他们实际了解高硫生铁对炼钢的害处。
    在合肥钢厂的促进和帮助下，财贸钢铁厂决心以好铁保钢，厂党委首先就生铁质量问题进行了全面检查，并在全体职工中展开讨论，同时召开了领导干部、技术人员、老工人参加的三结合的研究会，发动工人根据自己的体会，进行分析研究，边找关键，边提措施。原来，这个厂生铁质量所以一度下降，除思想认识上有片面性外，还在于：第一，没有把质量指标作为完成任务的内容之一；第二，小高炉经过技术改造，过去一些操作规程和管理制度已经不能适应当前生产情况；第三，原料管理工作放松了，入炉焦炭灰分大，不少高硫矿也没有拣出来。厂党委针对已找出来的关键，采取了切实有效的措施。立即从厂级、科室部门抽调九十多个干部，下放到车间、高炉和班、组，加强生产第一线，并且建立和健全了一套切合实际的料场管理制度，坚持用清水洗煤炼焦，把各种焦炭、矿石分级堆放，经过筛选入炉，减少入炉原料含硫量。这样，全体职工在生产中突破了一个个的炼铁质量关，使生铁质量迅速提高。
    生铁质量不断提高，大大鼓舞了合肥钢厂职工，他们决心把好铁炼成好钢。个个生龙活虎，到处谈措施，找点子，解决了一个又一个的具体关键问题。化铁炉熔化的铁水供应不上转炉炼钢的需要，成为全厂的薄弱环节，职工就大胆地把原来普通化铁炉改为高炉式化铁炉，并强化鼓风，采用外地行之有效的新经验——碱性化铁炉；同时积极改进化铁炉加料方法，保证化铁炉吃饱不亏料，很快突破了化铁炉技术关。接着，他们又针对转炉炉龄短的情况，一方面从打砖、砌炉、烘炉各个环节加以改进；一方面又针对过去三班操作、三班管理不统一等现象，积极加以调整，实行按炉子查核各项经济技术指标，职工责任心大大加强；炉龄迅速提高了一倍以上。（附图片）
