This newspaper's Shanghai, 7th dispatch: The Shanghai Kepei Instrument Factory, after producing a large number of advanced and precision new products, the factory's Party branch further mobilized the masses, actively created conditions, and enabled many new products to be quickly put into production. In June and July alone, eighteen new products were put into mass production.

At the beginning of this year, while vigorously carrying out "four modernizations," the Kepei Instrument Factory, based on the characteristics of instrument products, vigorously mobilized the masses to reform the design of old products. All the factory's workers started working, and in just four or five months, they reformed and trial-produced more than forty new varieties and new products of various thermal instruments, electrical instruments, and electronic instruments. Some of the reformed products are only half the size of the original ones, but the quality has been improved.

After the news of Kepei Factory's successful production of a large number of new products spread, a large number of factories, enterprises, and scientific research institutions in various places asked them to quickly supply a batch of new instruments to meet their needs. However, because Kepei Factory lacked a batch of molds and equipment necessary for mass production, coupled with other objective reasons, only two models of products were put into production by the end of May. None of the self-designed new products were mass-produced.

At the beginning of June, the Party branch of Kepei Factory held a meeting to summarize and review the work of putting new products into production in the first five months. It was found that after a large number of new instruments were successfully trial-produced, they could not be put into production in time. In addition to the poor conditions of the factory, the main reason was that some cadres did not have a firm enough concept of relying on the masses. They believed that it was possible to mobilize the masses to trial-produce a few samples of new products, but to mass-produce them, mobilizing the masses might not solve the problem. The Party branch criticized this idea and pointed out that because the input of new products into production involves a wide range of issues, some problems cannot be solved by a few people in a workshop or a group, and it is more necessary to rely on the strength of the masses to ensure that new products are put into production quickly.

After unifying ideological understanding, at the beginning of June, Kepei Factory launched a mass movement to put new products into mass production. Each workshop and group held meetings one after another to sort out the key issues of putting new products into production, discuss them one by one, and study measures. The Party branch secretary and the factory director also went deep into the workshops and discussed with the workers, finding many good methods. The most difficult problem everyone felt was the mold problem. There were only three master craftsmen in the factory who could make molds. If two new instruments were to be produced, more than one hundred molds would be needed, and the three people would have to be busy for at least half a year. In response to this problem, the factory organized a group of young workers to learn, make molds, and improve them with the help of the master craftsmen. After diligent study and hard practice, in less than a month, the number of workers who could make molds quickly increased to more than ten. One type of advanced instrument required sixty molds. While the workers stepped up mold making, they also found old molds, repaired them, and reused them. Some people combined the stamping processes of parts together, which greatly reduced the number of molds. In the end, the number of molds required was reduced to only nineteen.

After the masses were mobilized, problems that seemed more difficult to solve were also quickly solved. Some workers saw that their factory had few and old machine tools and equipment, and they could barely cope with the production of old products. If they were to produce new products, it would be even more insufficient. They inquired everywhere, and some people knew that a nearby factory was only running two shifts and had spare equipment. They immediately sent people to contact them to use the spare time to produce advanced products. Less than forty meters in front of the gate of Kepei Factory, there was a railway. Trains had to pass every few minutes. When the train passed, the factory buildings on the ground were shaken, and the inspection meter in the workshop would "dance" with it, making it impossible to carry out the calibration work of precision products. Young worker Xia Shouchang, based on his own practice, successfully researched a new method that eliminated the process of calibrating products with an inspection meter, solving this seemingly difficult problem.

    大胆创造新产品  大量生产新产品
    科培仪器厂六、七两月有十八种新产品成批投入生产
    本报上海7日电　上海科培仪器厂在制成大批高级精密新产品以后，工厂党支部进一步发动群众，积极创造条件，使许多新产品迅速投入了生产。6、7月份成批投入生产的产品就有十八种。
    今年年初，科培仪器厂在大搞“四化”的同时，根据仪器产品的特点，大力发动群众改革老产品的设计。全厂职工人人动手，短短四、五个月，就改革和试制成功各种热工仪器、电工仪器、电子仪器新品种和新产品四十多种。改革后的产品，有的只有原来的一半大，质量却比老产品提高了。
    科培厂制成大批新产品的消息传出后，各地大批工厂企业、科学研究机构纷纷要求他们赶快供应一批新仪器，满足他们的需要。但是科培厂因为缺少一批大量生产所必需的模具、设备，加上其他种种客观原因，结果到5月底，投入生产的只有两种型号的产品。自行设计的新产品，一种都没有成批生产。
    6月初，科培厂党支部召开会议，总结检查了前五个月新产品投入生产的工作，发现大批新仪器试制成功以后没有能够及时投料生产，除因工厂条件较差以外，主要是部分干部思想上依靠群众的观念不够坚定，认为试制个把新产品的样品，可以发动群众，要成批生产，发动群众不一定能解决问题。党支部批判了这种思想，并且指出：因为新产品的投入生产，涉及面较广，有些问题不是一个车间、一个小组的少数人所能解决，更需要依靠群众的力量，才能保证新产品迅速投入生产。
    在统一思想认识后，6月初，科培厂就掀起了一个新产品成批投入生产的群众运动。各车间、小组都纷纷召开会议，把新产品投入生产的关键问题进行排队，逐个讨论，研究措施。党支部书记、厂长也深入车间和工人一起商量，找到了许多好办法。原来大家感到最困难的是模具问题。厂里会开模具的老师傅只有三个，如果生产两种新仪器，就要一百多副模具，三个人至少要忙上半年。针对这个问题，厂里组织了一批青年工人在老师傅的帮助下，边学习、边开模、边改进。经过勤学苦练，不到一个月的时间，会开模具的工人马上增加到十多个人。有一种高级仪器，本来要六十副模具，工人们一边加紧开模，一边把旧模具找出来加以修理，重新利用；有些人把零件的冲制工序合在一起，模具也大大减少，最后所需要的模具减少到十九副就够了。
    在群众发动起来以后，看来比较难解决的问题，也都迅速得到了解决。有些工人看到自己厂里机床设备既少又老，平常生产老产品有时还应付不了，再要生产新产品，就更不够用。他们便到处打听，有人知道邻近有个工厂只开两班，设备有空，便立即派人前去接洽，利用人家空隙时间来生产高级产品。科培厂大门前不到四十米，便是一条铁路，火车每隔几分钟便要开过一次，火车一过，地面厂房受到震动，车间里的检验计就跟着一起“跳舞”，无法进行精密产品的校验工作。青年工人夏守诚根据自己的实践，研究成功了一种新方法，省掉了用检验计校验产品这个工艺，解决了这个看来不好解决的困难。
