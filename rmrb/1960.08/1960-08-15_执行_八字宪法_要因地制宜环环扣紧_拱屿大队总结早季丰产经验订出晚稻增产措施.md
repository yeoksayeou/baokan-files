    Implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" Must Suit Local Conditions and Be Closely Linked
    Gongyu Brigade Sums Up Early Rice Bumper Harvest Experience and Formulates Late Rice Production Increase Measures
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Gongyu Brigade of Guantou Commune in Lianjiang County, Fujian Province, achieved a great bumper harvest of early rice this year. The total output of 1,593 mu of early rice in the entire brigade increased by 75% compared with last year, and the yield per mu increased by 58%. While the commune members were immersed in the joy of the bumper harvest, the Gongyu Brigade Party Branch closely combined the summer harvest and summer planting, and mobilized the commune members to carry out a mass movement to summarize the bumper harvest experience, and on this basis, formulated late-season production increase measures to seize an even greater bumper harvest in the late season.
    The great bumper harvest of early rice in Gongyu Brigade this year was indeed hard-won. The natural conditions of this brigade are not very good. Of the brigade's more than 1,000 mu of rice fields, half are barren sandy soil, which suffers from drought or flood every year. In particular, pests and diseases are very serious, and many fields have suffered reduced production or even crop failure as a result, so the yield of early rice is only 200 to 300 jin per mu. Although this year was constantly attacked by four major disasters of insects, drought, wind, and floods, the broad masses of commune members, under the leadership of the Party Branch, watered and fought drought, wiped out pests, fought typhoons, and won a bumper harvest.
    In order to guide the late-season production increase with the early-season bumper harvest experience, and to turn the summer bumper harvest into a driving force for striving for a greater bumper harvest in the autumn, as early as before and after the start of the harvest, Lin Liangyou, the first secretary of the commune party committee, came to the brigade and, together with the brigade cadres, organized the masses to observe and discuss in the fields, and carried out single-item summaries such as "comparison between dense planting and sparse planting," "comparison between machine transplanting and manual transplanting," and "comparison between early planting and late planting," which initially educated the cadres and the broad masses of commune members, and prepared for a comprehensive summary. After the summer harvest, the brigade combined the verification of output and launched a mass movement to summarize the bumper harvest experience.
    Implementing the Eight-Character Constitution Must Strive for Comprehensiveness
    During the discussion in the Third Production Team, the old farmers collectively created a jingle: "The Eight-Character Constitution is an eight-character scripture, if one character is missing, it is not true; the Eight-Character Constitution is eight treasures, if one is missing, it is not good." This jingle expresses the common view of many commune members.
    Gongyu Brigade has implemented the Eight-Character Constitution relatively well this year. The Party Branch made thorough arrangements for the eight aspects of water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, protection, management, and labor as early as before the spring plowing, linking one link to another, without relaxing any link, and paying great attention to the relationship and constraints between them. Therefore, this year's implementation of the Eight-Character Constitution is more comprehensive and more meticulous than in any previous year. For example, in dense planting, last year's planting was 7×7 inches and 7×6 inches, while this year's dense planting has achieved specifications of 5×5 inches and 5×6 inches; with dense planting as the center, water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, protection, and management have also closely followed. These measures have laid a solid material foundation for this year's early rice bumper harvest. At the beginning of spring plowing, the entire team widely promoted rational fertilization and sparse sowing to cultivate strong seedlings; due to insufficient labor, 61 various vehicles and 7 wooden boats were promoted to realize transportation by vehicles, ensuring field management and fertilization. ... All of these have powerfully guaranteed the realization of a substantial increase in production. During the discussion, the commune members also pointed out that individual fields, because they did not grasp individual links tightly, or because one link was grasped but other links were not followed up accordingly, the production increase was discounted, which further proved the importance of comprehensively implementing the Eight-Character Constitution from the opposite side. Ni Fakang, a member of the Second Team, cited a vivid example: This year, when the members of the Second Team were transplanting seedlings in the fields behind the Land Temple during the spring plowing, the execution of the dense planting specifications was very strict at the beginning, and all seedlings were planted at 5×6; but later, some members became impatient and changed to 7×7. As a result, although the farming conditions were exactly the same, the densely planted fields increased production by more than 70%, while the sparsely planted fields increased production by only 26%.
    Implementing the Eight-Character Constitution Must Suit Local Conditions
    "What medicine to take for what disease, what fertilizer to use for what land," is the second lesson learned by Gongyu commune members. They believe that in implementing the Eight-Character Constitution, not only should attention be paid to the coordination between the eight characters, but also to its relationship with the external natural environment. Before the spring plowing this year, the Party Branch conducted an in-depth investigation of the soil quality, water conservancy, and meteorological conditions of more than 1,000 mu of rice fields, and formulated a cultivation plan based on the "five observations" (observing soil quality, terrain, water source, climate, and previous crops), so that the Eight-Character Constitution was implemented in the fields, and a summer bumper harvest was won. According to this year's harvest and historical conditions, local dense planting is best at 5×6 inches and 5×5 inches. In terms of seed selection and fertilization, sandy fields should be planted with Korean japonica rice and more pig and cattle manure should be applied to increase organic matter; muddy fields should be planted with Nantao No. 1 and Lucai No. 1, and garbage fertilizer should be used to loosen the soil.... During the discussion, Ni Faxing, the production captain of the Third Team, raised the following question: The soil layer in Wengyang is thick and the soil quality is fertile, while the soil layer in Xibianli is thin and sandy, so logically the yield of Wengyang should be higher than that of Xibianli, but the Korean japonica rice planted in Wengyang last year only yielded more than 100 jin per mu, while the Korean japonica rice planted in Xibianli this year yielded more than 300 jin. What is the reason for this? After specific analysis and comparison, the commune members came to the conclusion: The selection of varieties must depend on the soil conditions.
    During the discussion, the commune members also cited many examples to illustrate that not only should the Eight-Character Constitution be implemented according to natural conditions, but more importantly, the natural conditions should be transformed with revolutionary spirit to make it adapt to the requirements of the Eight-Character Constitution, which is an active application of the principle of suiting measures to local conditions.
    Grasp the Key and Clarify the Main Direction
    Gongyu Brigade is a well-known "insect nest" in Guantou Commune. In previous years, the crops started well, but as soon as pests and diseases came, they changed in a few days. In recent years, the area affected by pests and diseases has been 700 to 800 mu every year. In view of this situation, the Party Branch has consciously grasped the key to pest and disease prevention and control since the beginning of this year and conducted in-depth investigation and research. They found that the occurrence of pests and diseases has seasonal and regional characteristics, and that climate, soil, terrain and other factors have a great relationship with it, and it is also affected by technical measures such as water, fertilizer, density, and seed. Based on this analysis, the Party Branch adopted the strategy of "two initiatives and three simultaneous measures." ("Two initiatives" are: sowing and transplanting seedlings early to avoid the most unfavorable season and grasp the initiative of time; attacking the enemy first, taking the initiative to attack, and eliminating pests and diseases before they occur. "Three simultaneous measures" are: treating both the symptoms and the root causes simultaneously, focusing on prevention and control and comprehensive prevention and control simultaneously, and side-by-side coordination of drug and mechanical prevention and control with technical measures such as water, fertilizer, soil, and seeds.) Because the objective laws were grasped and practical measures were formulated, the area affected by pests and diseases in the team this year was greatly reduced, and they were treated quickly and well, with basically no losses.
    This nationwide summary movement in Gongyu Brigade has gradually improved the ideological understanding of cadres and commune members, forming a propaganda movement for bumper harvest experience. On the basis of a comprehensive summary, the Party Branch seized the opportunity and guided the situation, and formulated a plan to continue to comprehensively implement the Eight-Character Constitution for agriculture, focusing on grasping the three major keys of fertilizer, protection, and management, and striving for a greater bumper harvest of late rice.

    执行“八字宪法”要因地制宜环环扣紧
    拱屿大队总结早季丰产经验订出晚稻增产措施
    本报讯　福建连江县琯头公社拱屿大队今年早稻获得了大丰收。全队一千五百九十三亩早稻总产量比去年增长75％，单产增长58％。当社员群众沉浸在丰收喜悦的时日里，拱屿大队党支部密切结合夏收夏种，发动社员开展了群众性的总结丰产经验运动，并在这一基础上，订出了晚季增产措施，夺取晚季更大丰收。
    拱屿大队今年早稻大丰收确实是来之不易。这个大队的自然条件并不算好，全队一千多亩稻田，有一半是瘠薄的砂质地，每年不是受旱，就是受涝。特别是病虫害十分严重，不少田地因此减产甚至失收，所以早稻产量一亩只二、三百斤。今年虽然受到了虫、旱、风、洪四大灾害的不断袭击，可是广大社员在党支部领导下，车水抗旱，扑灭虫害，迎战台风，夺得了大丰收。
    为了以早季丰收的经验指导晚季增产，让夏季丰收成为争取秋季更大丰收的动力，早在开镰前后，公社党委第一书记林良友就来到大队，和大队干部一起组织群众到田头观摩座谈，进行了“密植与稀植对比”、“机插与手插对比”、“早插与晚插对比”等单项总结，初步教育了干部和广大社员，并为全面总结作好了准备。夏收结束后，大队又结合核实产量，开展一个总结丰产经验的群众运动。
    执行八字宪法必须力求全面
    第三生产小队在讨论时，老农们集体创作了一个顺口溜：“八字宪法八字经，缺了一字就不真；八字宪法八件宝，缺了一件就不好。”这个顺口溜道出了许多社员的共同看法。
    拱屿大队今年贯彻八字宪法是比较好的。党支部早在春耕以前就对水、肥、土、种、密、保、管、工八个方面进行了周密的安排，一环扣一环，每一环都不放松，而且十分注意彼此之间的联系和制约。因此今年贯彻八字宪法比以往任何一年更全面、更细致。比如密植，去年插7×7寸、7×6寸，今年密植实现了5×5寸与5×6寸的规格；以密植为中心，水、肥、土、种、保、管也都紧紧跟上。这些措施给今年早稻丰收打下了坚实的物质基础。春耕开始时，全队又普遍推广了合理施肥与稀播种育壮秧；劳力不足，推广各种车子六十一架、木船七条，实现运输车子化，保证了看田施肥。……凡此种种，都有力地保证了大幅度增产的实现。讨论中，社员们还指出：个别田地由于在个别环节上没有抓紧，或者一个环节抓了，其他环节没相应跟上，增产就打了折扣，从反面进一步证明了全面贯彻八字宪法的重要性。二队社员倪法康举了一个生动的事例：今年春耕时二队社员在土地宫后田里插秧，开头执行密植规格很严格，一律插5×6；但是插到后来，有的社员不耐烦了，改插7×7。结果耕作条件虽然完全相同，密植的就增产了七成多，插得稀的只增产二成六。
    执行八字宪法必须因地制宜
    “什么病吃什么药，什么地用什么肥”，这是拱屿社员的第二个体会。他们认为：贯彻八字宪法，不仅要注意八字之间的配合，还要注意它与外界自然环境的关系。今年春耕前，支部深入调查了一千多亩稻田的土质、水利、气象等各方面情况，并根据“五看”（看土质、看地势、看水源、看气候、看前作）的原则制定了耕作计划，使八字宪法落实到田，争得了夏季丰收。根据今年收成和历年情况，当地密植以5×6寸、5×5寸为最好。在选种用肥方面，沙田宜种朝鲜粳，多施猪牛粪，以增加有机质；泥田宜种南特号和陆财号，用垃圾肥以疏松土壤……。在讨论中，三队生产队长倪发兴提出了这样一个问题：翁洋地方土层厚、土质肥，溪边里地方土层薄、砂质多，照理翁洋的产量该比溪边里高，可是朝鲜粳去年种在翁洋每亩只收一百多斤，今年种在溪边里却收三百多斤。这是什么缘故呢？经过具体分析和比较，社员们得出结论：选择品种，必须看土质条件。
    在讨论中，社员们还举出了不少例子，说明不仅要根据自然条件来贯彻八字宪法，更重要的是用革命精神来改造自然条件，使它适应八字宪法的要求，这才是积极地运用了因地制宜的原则。
    抓住关键明确主攻方向
    拱屿大队是琯头公社有名的“虫窝”，历年来庄稼开头都很好，可是病虫害一来，几天内就变了样。最近这几年，年年受害面积都有七、八百亩。针对这种情况，支部从今年年初起，就有意识地抓住防治病虫这个要害，深入调查研究。他们发现病虫害的发生具有季节性、区域性的特点，气候、土壤、地形等因素对它有很大关系，同时也受水、肥、密、种等技术措施的影响。根据这种分析，支部采取了“二主动，三并举”的对策。（“二主动”是：提早播种插秧，避开最不利的季节，掌握时间主动权；先敌下手，主动进攻，把病虫消灭在未发生以前。“三并举”是：治标治本并举，重点防治与全面防治并举，药械防治与水肥土种等技术措施侧面配合并举。）由于掌握了客观规律和订出了切实的措施，因此今年队里病虫发生面积大大缩小，而且治得快、治得好，基本上没受损失。
    拱屿大队这一场全民总结运动，使干部、社员的思想认识逐步提高，形成了一个丰产经验的宣传运动。在全面总结的基础上，支部又趁热打铁，因势利导，制定了继续全面贯彻农业八字宪法，着重抓肥、保、管三大关键，争取晚稻更大丰收的计划。
