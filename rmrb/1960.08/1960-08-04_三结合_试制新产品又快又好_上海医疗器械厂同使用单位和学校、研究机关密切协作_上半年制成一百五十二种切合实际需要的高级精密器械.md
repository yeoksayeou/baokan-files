Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 3rd: The advanced precision products trial-produced by the Shanghai Medical Device Factory using the "three-way combination" method of factories, schools and research institutions, and user units have achieved the goals of being numerous, high-quality, and meeting practical needs. In the first half of this year, the factory successfully trial-produced 152 types of advanced precision new products, equivalent to eight times the total for the entire last year. Among them, high vacuum pumps, diffusion pumps, artificial livers, iron lungs, artificial heart-lung machines, and new surgical instruments for abdominal surgery, among twenty-three types, have been officially put into production. The majority of the rest are continuing to be researched or are undergoing evaluation and clinical trials at user units.

Early this year, higher-level authorities requested this factory to produce nationally needed advanced vacuum pumps and a series of supporting equipment. The Party committee felt that the factory's internal technical strength was insufficient, so it proposed extending the factory's internal "three-way combination" method to external entities. The Party committee secretary personally led workers and technicians to educational, research institutions, and factories and enterprises using high vacuum pumps in cities such as Beijing, Nanjing, and Hangzhou, obtaining a great deal of valuable technical theoretical knowledge and relevant technical data. Nanjing Institute of Technology also sent specialists to the factory to help. As a result, they only spent a little over a month to preliminarily trial-produce two new types of advanced vacuum pumps and manufactured instruments for measuring ultra-high vacuum pumps. Subsequently, they further developed the experience of external "three-way combination" in medical device manufacturing. In the trial production of new medical devices, in addition to establishing a regular contact system with relevant scientific research institutions, universities, and user units to exchange technical experience, they also adopted three forms. One is to go out and combine. The Party committee secretary, factory director, workers, and technicians often go to hospitals to participate in "consultations" for patients with heart, lung, and burn injuries, listening to the opinions of doctors, nurses, and patients. Through these activities, they deeply appreciated the pain of the patients and understood the patients' requirements for medical devices, arousing their strong desire to trial-produce new medical devices. After returning, they began to research and manufacture various new medical devices for patients. The second method is to invite them in to combine. They often invite doctors to the factory to give pathology lessons, helping workers understand the condition and listen to doctors' opinions on medical device manufacturing, so that workers have a further understanding of the role of the instruments. Another way is mutual "study abroad." The factory assigns technicians to hospitals as "interns" to follow doctors in ward rounds, diagnose diseases, and do animal experiments to gain perceptual knowledge. Hospitals also send doctors to the factory to work with workers to specifically study the problem of manufacturing medical devices. The septicemia treatment machine for rescuing burn patients, which was manufactured in March and April this year, was created by a technician who was sent out as an "intern" and returned to the factory, cooperating with workers and doctors who came to the factory to help with production. In the first half of the year, a hospital in another location, in order to alleviate the pain of patients, wanted to reform the old surgical method and requested this factory to manufacture new surgical instruments that would simplify the surgical procedure, allowing several procedures to be completed in one step. They sent specialized doctors to study together with the factory's technicians and workers. After two months of efforts, they finally manufactured three new surgical instruments. After clinical trials, all were successful.

The widespread application of the experience of external "three-way combination" to produce advanced precision products has made these products more in line with practical needs. In the past, their trial production of new products mainly relied on flipping through books and finding information; sometimes they also went outside the factory, but not regularly, and they followed the expert route, only looking for professors and consultants, not doctors and nurses. Therefore, the number of new products trial-produced was small, the speed was slow, and the new products successfully trial-produced did not all meet practical needs. Now, they take the needs of the user units as the goal of trial-producing new products, so the 152 types of advanced precision products successfully trial-produced in the first half of this year are generally products urgently needed by current production and medical units. After vigorously promoting external "three-way combination," the topics for trial production of new products have also greatly increased. Many projects cannot only not be found in books and reference materials, but also cannot even be conceived without going deep into reality. For example, new products such as tumor therapy machines and artificial liver machines were determined as trial production projects only after going deep into reality and understanding the actual situation.

Widely using external "three-way combination" to tackle advanced precision products has now become a conscious and urgent requirement of the factory's employees. Workers say: In the past, we did not dare to tackle "high, precise, and cutting-edge" products. Now, the more cutting-edge, the more we want to tackle, and the more we tackle, the more energetic we become. Zhang Yongde, Zhou Jinfa, Wu Tongyu and other three workers took the initiative to go to Guangci Hospital to understand the hospital's requirements for new products. The director of the pediatrics department of the hospital asked them to help manufacture an instrument to solve the problem of the danger of intestinal intussusception surgery in infants. After returning to the factory, they worked together with the workshop workers, technicians, and doctors in their spare time to create a small pediatric intussusception medical instrument that did not require surgery, reducing the pain of children with this disease and ensuring the safety of sick children's lives.

### “三结合”试制新产品又快又好  上海医疗器械厂同使用单位和学校、研究机关密切协作  上半年制成一百五十二种切合实际需要的高级精密器械

    “三结合”试制新产品又快又好
    上海医疗器械厂同使用单位和学校、研究机关密切协作  上半年制成一百五十二种切合实际需要的高级精密器械
    新华社上海3日电　上海医疗器械厂运用工厂、学校和研究机关、使用单位“三结合”的方法试制出的高级精密产品，达到了又多又好又符合实际需要。今年上半年全厂试制成功一百五十二种高级精密新产品，相当于去年全年的八倍。其中高真空泵、扩散泵、人工肝脏、铁肺、人工心肺机，以及进行腹部手术的新型手术器械等二十三种，已正式投入生产。其余大部分都在继续研究，或在使用单位鉴定和临床试用。
    今年初，上级机关要求这个厂生产国家需要的高级真空泵和一系列配套设备。党委感到厂内的技术力量已不够，就提出把厂内“三结合”的方法发展到厂外去。党委书记亲自带领工人、技术人员跑到北京、南京、杭州等城市的教育、研究机关和使用高真空泵的工厂企业，取得了很多宝贵的技术理论知识和有关技术资料。南京工学院还派专人来厂帮助。结果，他们只花了一个多月就初步试制成功两种新型的高级的真空泵，并制造出测量超高真空泵的仪器。接着，他们又在医疗器械制造方面，进一步发展了厂外“三结合”的经验。他们在试制新的医疗器械中，除了与有关的科学研究机关、高等学校和使用单位建立经常的联系制度，交流技术经验外，还采用三种形式。一种是，跑出去结合。党委书记、厂长、工人和技术人员，经常到医院参加对心、肺、灼伤病人的“会诊”，听取医生、护士、病人的意见。通过这些活动，使他们深刻体会到病人的痛苦和了解到病人对医疗器械的要求，激起了他们要试制新的医疗器械的强烈愿望。回来后，就着手为病人研究制造各种新的医疗器械。第二种方式是，请进来结合。他们经常请医生到工厂讲病理课，帮助工人了解病情，听取医生们对医疗器械制造的意见，使工人对器械的作用有了进一步了解。还有一种方式是相互“留学”。工厂指派技术员到医院做“实习生”，跟随医生一起查病房，诊断疾病，做动物试验，以取得感性知识。医院也派医生到工厂和工人一起劳动，具体研究制造医疗器械的问题。今年3、4月制成的抢救灼伤病人的败血症治疗机，就是派出去当“实习生”的技术员回厂后，和工人及来厂帮助生产的医生合作制造成功的。上半年，外地一个医院为了减轻病人痛苦，要改革老的开刀方法，要求这个厂制造简化开刀手续的新的手术器械，使几道手续一道完成。他们派来了专门医生和厂里的技术人员、工人一起研究，经过两个月的努力，终于制造出三种新的手术器械。经过临床试验，全部得到成功。
    广泛运用厂外“三结合”的经验来生产高级精密产品，使这些产品更加符合了实际需要。过去他们试制新产品，主要依靠翻书本，找资料；有时也到厂外去，但不经常，而且走的是专家路线，只找教授、顾问，不找医生、护士。因此试制的新产品少，速度慢，试制成功的新产品也不全部符合实际需要。现在，他们把使用单位的需要，作为试制新产品的目标，因此今年上半年所试制成功的一百五十二种高级精密产品，一般都是当前生产、医疗单位迫切需要的产品。大搞厂外“三结合”以后，试制新产品的课题也大为增加。很多项目不仅是书本和参考资料上翻不到的，而且是不深入实际连想也想不出的。如肿瘤治疗机、人工肝脏机等新产品，都是因为深入实际了解实际以后，才确定为试制项目的。
    广泛运用厂外“三结合”攻高级精密产品，现在已成为这个厂职工自觉的迫切要求。工人们说：过去“高精尖”产品我们不敢攻，现在越尖越要攻，越攻越有劲。张永德、周金发、吴同浴等三个工人，主动到广慈医院去，了解医院对新产品的要求。医院儿科主任医师要求他们帮助制造一种器械来解决婴儿套肠开刀容易发生危险的问题。他们回厂后，就在业余时间和车间工人、技术人员、医生一起动手，造出了不需开刀的小儿套肠医疗器，减少了得此病的儿童的痛苦，保证了患儿的生命安全。（附图片）
