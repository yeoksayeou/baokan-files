    Auctioning the Soul
    By Qiao Yu, Cartoon by Fang Cheng
    In ancient China, feudal aristocrats often kept a group of retainers. These retainers were either idle companions, helpers, or accomplices. They might compose poetry, crack jokes, or collect rent and make loans, and indeed possessed some skill in helping, being idle, or abetting wrongdoing. However, the latter-day retainers of contemporary Western bourgeois aristocrats have nothing left but their naked animalistic instincts and their naked, base shamelessness.

    Saying it is believing it, so please take a look at this "strange" piece of news:

    "Recently, a group of writers in Britain placed advertisements in newspapers, stating that they were willing to rent themselves out to embellish parties held by the upper classes. The rent is one pound sterling per night, with an additional pound sterling for every hour past midnight. When hired, they will attend parties in their traditional manner - unkempt, rude, weary of everything, and with brilliant minds. These people say: they will be 'loved' by the nobles like their own little dogs." (People's Daily, August 9th, page 6)

    What kind of creative "freedom" is this? The price of a writer is equal to or less than that of a small dog. Auctioning the soul is also auctioning the freedom of the body!

    According to reports, the above-mentioned writers belong to the "beat generation."

    "Beat generation" is a rather "modern" name. It vividly reflects a fact, a trend: these writers, along with the class they depend on, will collapse together! (Attached picture)

    灵魂的拍卖
    樵渔文  方成画
    我国古时候的封建贵族，常常豢养一群食客。这群食客或帮闲、或帮忙、或帮凶。他们或吟诗作赋，或打诨插科，或收租放债，确实还多少有点帮忙、帮闲或帮凶的本领。而当代西方资产阶级贵族的那些末流食客们，却什么也没有，剩下来的是赤条条的动物性的本能，是赤条条的下流无耻。
    口说无凭，请看看这条“奇”闻吧：
    “最近英国有一批文人在报纸上刊登广告，表示愿把自己出租，去点缀上层人士举办的晚会。每晚租金一金镑，超过十二点另加一金镑。被租时，他们将按照自己的传统方式出席晚会——不修边幅，粗鲁无理，厌倦一切，富有头脑。这些人表示：他们会受到贵人们像对自己的小狗一样的‘爱’。”（8月9日人民日报第六版）
    这是什么创作“自由”？文人的售价，等于或低于一条小狗。拍卖灵魂，同时也是拍卖肉体的自由！
    据消息说，上述这批文人是属于“垮掉的一代”。
    “垮掉的一代”，这个名称是怪“摩登”的。它生动地反映了一个事实，一个趋势：这些文人，将连同他们所依附的阶级，一同垮掉！（附图片）
