　　 Kunming, August 17th (Reported by this newspaper) - Yuxi Prefecture in Yunnan Province, through a comprehensive and thorough implementation of the grain contract production policy, has implemented the contract production targets. Seizing the critical moment of the current growth of major autumn crops, it has organized 260,000 laborers in the region to launch two "Surpassing Contracted Production Assault Fortnight" campaigns that are both large-scale and deeply rooted. Under the strong leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in the region have redoubled their efforts, and the movement to exceed production is advancing courageously.

　　 After a comprehensive and thorough implementation of the grain contract production policy and the implementation of contract production targets in Yuxi Prefecture, the production enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and commune members has been mobilized, and a new atmosphere of high attendance, rapid progress, solid measures, and swift action has emerged. The labor attendance rate in Yuanjiang, Yuxi, Huaning, and Eshan counties has generally increased from 80% to over 95%; the progress of mid-season field management has also accelerated by half to one times. In response to the urgent desire of cadres and commune members to greatly exceed production, the Yuxi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the fighting call of "Vigorously grasp mid-season cultivation and topdressing, vigorously grasp expanded planting," which immediately received enthusiastic response from the vast number of cadres and the masses.

　　 In Eshan County, cadres and commune members of the communes' management areas and production teams put forward the slogan: Everyone knows the contract production, "Know how much to contract, how much to exceed production, and how to exceed the contract production." The county mobilized more than 22,000 people in five days, sent out 50,000 loads of fertilizer to suppress the seedlings, weeded 40,000 mu of rice fields, and planted more than 12,000 mu of sweet potatoes and miscellaneous grains.

　　 After the mass movement to surpass contracted production was launched, the Yuxi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly organized secretaries at the prefectural, county, commune, and management area levels to go deep into the teams to provide specific assistance in their work. After leading cadres at all levels went deep into the fields, they found that there were many weeds in most fields, some seedlings were deficient in fertilizer and turned yellow, a few had already formed buds and were pregnant with ears, and most seedlings had rounded stems and were in the process of topdressing. They discussed with the commune members to increase production measures, and believed that as long as they seized the favorable opportunity in August to strengthen field management and strive for more grain, there was great potential. They immediately decided to organize and solidly fight two battles to surpass contracted production, and win a complete victory in surpassing contracted production. The plan was from July 25 to August 5 as the first battle, requiring all weeds that had not been completely removed to be removed, and all crops that should be topdressed to be topdressed again. The second battle was to grasp multiple planting and multiple harvesting. From August 6 to August 15, the region organized 130,000 laborers to go to the mountains to expand the planting of late autumn crops within ten days.

　　 In order to ensure the smooth realization of the assault fortnight's tasks, the counties and communes adopted the method of concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles. The region transferred more than 10,000 people from county and commune enterprises, animal husbandry, logistics, and other aspects to support agricultural production, ensuring that 70% of the labor force in the region was on the front line of agricultural production, fiercely attacking weeding and topdressing. After a large number of new forces went into battle, the counties promptly strengthened the labor organization work, ensuring that every front had leadership, every task had a quota, every matter had quality standards, and everyone had specific tasks. During the assault fortnight, the daily progress of weeding and topdressing in the entire region rapidly increased from 52,000 mu to 83,000 mu.

    力争秋粮实产超包产
    玉溪专区超包产运动既热烈又扎实
    本报昆明17日电　云南省玉溪专区通过全面深入地贯彻执行粮食包产政策，落实了包产指标，抓住当前大秋作物生长的关键时刻，组织全区二十六万劳动大军，展开了两个既声势浩大、又扎实深入的超包产突击旬。全区各族群众在党的强有力的领导下，干劲倍增，超产运动一往直前。
    玉溪专区通过全面深入地贯彻粮食包产政策，落实包产指标之后，调动了广大干部和社员的生产积极性，出现了出勤多、进度快、措施扎实、行动迅猛的一片新气象。元江、玉溪、华宁、?江等县的劳动出勤率普遍由80％提高到95％以上；中耕进度也加快了半倍到一倍。中共玉溪地委针对干部和社员要求大大超产的迫切愿望，提出了“大抓中耕追肥，大抓扩种”的战斗号召，立即得到广大干部群众的热烈响应。
    ?江县各公社的管理区生产队的干部和社员提出：包产人人三知道“知道包产多少，超产多少，如何超包产”的口号，全县在五天内就出动二万二千多人，送出五万挑肥料压了领苗，拔了四万亩田的稗子，又种下红薯和杂粮一万二千多亩。
    超包产的群众运动开展起来以后，中共玉溪地委又及时组织地、县、公社、管理区四级书记深入到队，具体帮助工作。各级领导干部深入田间后，发现目前大部分田里杂草很多，一部分苗棵缺肥转黄，少数已打苞孕穗，大部分苗棵已经圆秆，正在加工追肥的火候上。他们便和社员一起商量增产措施，认为只要抓住8月的有利时机加强田间管理，力争多打粮，大有可为。便立即决定组织扎扎实实打好两个超包产的战役，夺取超包产的全胜。计划7月25日至8月5日为第一个战役，要求把没有薅光的草全部薅光，把应该追肥的农作物全部再追一次肥。第二个战役是抓多种多收，从8月6日起至8月15日止，十天内全区组织十三万劳动力上山扩种晚秋作物。
    为了保证突击旬任务的顺利实现，各县、公社都采取集中优势兵力打歼灭战的办法。全区共从县社企业、畜牧、后勤等方面，抽出万多人支援农业生产，保证了全区70％的劳动力在农业生产第一线上，猛攻薅锄追肥。大批生力军上阵以后，各县又及时加强了劳动组织工作，做到条条战线有领导、项项活计有定额、事事有质量标准、人人有具体任务。突击旬中，全专区薅锄追肥日进度由五万二千亩迅速提高到八万三千亩。
