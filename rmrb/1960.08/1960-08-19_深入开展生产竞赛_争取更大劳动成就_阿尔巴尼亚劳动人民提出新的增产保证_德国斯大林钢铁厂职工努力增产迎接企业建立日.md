    Deepen the Production Competition, Strive for Greater Labor Achievements
    Albanian Laboring People Propose New Production Increase Guarantees
    German Stalin Steel Plant Workers Strive to Increase Production to Greet the Establishment Day of the Enterprise
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, August 17th: The laboring people in various regions of Albania are further developing the production competition and have proposed new production increase guarantees.

    In July, various districts of Albania successfully held meetings of activists on the economic front. According to statistics from only sixteen districts, including Durrës, and the city of Tirana, the laboring masses have increased the value of this year's production increase guarantees to 975 million leks, an increase of over 357 million leks compared to the original guarantees. The city of Tirana, leading the production increase competition, has proposed production increase guarantees of 93 million leks. Most of the enterprises in the aforementioned districts and cities have completed and exceeded their production plans for the first seven months of this year.

    In order to summarize the achievements of the competition and propose tasks for further deepening the competition, the Central Committee of the Albanian Socialist Competition convened a meeting on August 11th, pointing out that the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party is only three months away. Therefore, it called on all laboring people to strengthen their efforts and use greater achievements in labor to welcome this major event.
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 14th: Nearly six thousand workers of the Stalin Steel United Enterprise, the largest metallurgical center in the German Democratic Republic, are greeting the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the united enterprise and the city of Stalin (August 18th) with new production achievements.

    As early as the first half of this year, the workers of the united enterprise put forward many advanced indicators and launched a labor competition to greet this meaningful holiday. In the first half of this year, the united enterprise overproduced more than 21,000 tons of pig iron beyond the state plan. The workers responded to the call of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party on saving raw materials and achieved outstanding results. In the first half of the year, a saving of 13,938 tons of coke alone was achieved, and the entire united enterprise created more than 2 million marks of wealth for the country as a construction fund for the Seven-Year Plan.

    On August 6th, the workers created a high-yield record of 4,028 tons of pig iron produced per day. In the first ten days of August, the entire enterprise overproduced 477 tons of pig iron beyond the plan. Transportation workers have implemented direct transportation of incoming and outgoing goods since August 1st, which will reduce costs by 540,000 marks within the year. Locomotive stoker workers plan to save another 1,000 tons of coal by the end of the year on the basis of saving coal in the first half of this year.

    The Stalin Steel United Enterprise was built in August 1950 as a metallurgical industrial base in order to develop the country's basic raw material industry, according to the decision of the Third Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party. From 1951 to 1954, six blast furnaces were successively built and put into production. At present, the annual output of pig iron from this enterprise has increased from more than 260,000 tons in 1952 to more than 1.1 million tons, accounting for about two-thirds of the entire pig iron production in the German Democratic Republic. During the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965), the united enterprise will also build new modern steelmaking plants and rolling mills.

    深入开展生产竞赛　争取更大劳动成就
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民提出新的增产保证
    德国斯大林钢铁厂职工努力增产迎接企业建立日
    新华社地拉那17日电　阿尔巴尼亚各地劳动人民进一步开展生产竞赛，并纷纷提出了新的增产保证。
    在7月间，阿尔巴尼亚各区都分别成功地召开了经济战线积极分子会议。仅据都拉斯等十六个区和地拉那市统计，劳动群众已把今年增产保证的产值提高到九亿七千五百多万里克，比原提出的保证增加了三亿五千七百多万里克。走在增产竞赛前列的地拉那市提出的增产保证达九千三百万里克。上述区市的大部分企业都已完成和超额完成今年前七个月的生产计划。
    为总结竞赛成就和提出下一步更加深入开展竞赛的任务，阿尔巴尼亚社会主义竞赛中央委员会11日召开了会议，指出阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第四次代表大会距现在仅有三个月，因此号召全体劳动人民加强努力，用劳动中的更大成就来迎接这个重大的事件。
    据新华社柏林14日电　德意志民主共和国最大的冶金中心斯大林钢铁联合企业的近六千名职工，正以新的生产成就来迎接联合企业和斯大林城建立十周年（8月18日）。
    早在今年上半年，联合企业的工人就提出许多先进指标，展开劳动竞赛，来迎接这个有意义的节日。联合企业在今年上半年超过国家计划多生产了二万一千多吨生铁。工人们响应了德国统一社会党中央关于节约原材料的号召，创造了出色成绩。上半年，仅焦炭一项就节省了一万三千九百三十八吨，整个联合企业为国家多创造了二百多万马克财富，作为投入七年计划的建设基金。
    8月6日，工人们创造了日产生铁四千零二十八吨的高产纪录。8月份头十天，全企业已超计划多生产四百七十七吨生铁。运输工人8月1日起实行进出货物的直接运输，年内将使成本降低五十四万马克。机车司炉工人在今年上半年节约用煤基础上计划到年底再节约一千吨煤。
    斯大林钢铁联合企业是根据德国统一社会党第三次代表大会的决定，为了发展本国基本原料工业，而在1950年8月兴建的一个冶金工业基地。1951到1954年，先后建成了六个高炉并投入生产。目前，这个企业的生铁年产量已从1952年的二十六万多吨增加到一百一十多万吨，占德意志民主共和国整个生铁生产的三分之二左右。七年计划（1959—1965）期间，联合企业还要新建现代化的炼钢厂和轧钢厂等。
