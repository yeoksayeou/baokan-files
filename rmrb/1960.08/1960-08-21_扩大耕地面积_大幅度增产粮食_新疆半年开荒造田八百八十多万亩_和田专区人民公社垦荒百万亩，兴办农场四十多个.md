    Expand Cultivated Land Area and Greatly Increase Grain Production
    Xinjiang Reclaims Over 8.8 Million Mu of Wasteland in Half a Year
    Hetian Prefecture People's Communes Reclaim One Million Mu, Establish Over 40 Farms

    Urumqi, August 20th (Reported by this newspaper) In implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, Party committees at all levels in Xinjiang have conquered over 8.8 million mu of arid wasteland in more than half a year, completing the annual land reclamation plan ahead of schedule and exceeding it, creating the highest speed of land reclamation in Xinjiang since liberation. At present, various places continue to dig canals and divert water, reclaim wasteland and create fields, and actively prepare to expand the winter wheat planting area to ensure a continuous leap forward in agricultural production next year.

    Simultaneous construction of water conservancy and land reclamation, combined with year-round land reclamation and crash land reclamation, side reclamation, side planting, and using the method of continuously expanding the cultivated land area to greatly increase the production of grain and cotton, is a policy determined by the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Party Committee to develop agriculture at high speed. In the past six months, Party committees at all levels have resolutely implemented this policy, expanding the sown area of various crops by 10 million mu compared to last year (part of which was wasteland reclaimed last winter), of which the area of grain crops has increased sharply by more than 30%. The sown area of various crops such as cotton, oil, melons, vegetables, and sugar beets has also increased significantly compared to last year, with cotton increasing by 13% and oil crops increasing by more than 20%, further resolving the contradiction between grain and economic crops competing for land.

    This year, the Xinjiang land reclamation began on a scale involving the whole Party and all the people. People's communes, military reclamation farms of the Production and Construction Corps, local state-owned farms, and all walks of life such as organs, schools, industrial and mining enterprises, and the army have participated in this movement.

    In the land reclamation movement, people's communes and state-owned farms adapted to local conditions, timing, and people, and launched mass movements on a large scale. In southern Xinjiang and the Turpan Basin, where the population is relatively large, people's communes generally took production brigades or management areas as units during the gaps in busy production (such as before and after spring sowing), under the unified leadership of the commune, organized large numbers of expeditions, went deep into the original wasteland, set up camps, and while digging canals and diverting water, digging karez wells, they also reclaimed wasteland, created fields, and built roads.

    People's communes in the northern Xinjiang region generally adopted the method of large-scale collaboration between communes, teams, agricultural areas and pastoral areas, high-altitude cold mountainous areas and plain areas, winning time and accelerating the speed of land reclamation and sowing. Tacheng Prefecture, with a population of only 220,000, adopted the above method this year, expanding the sown area of the entire prefecture by 700,000 mu.

    Military reclamation farms and local state-owned farms distributed in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains have also fully utilized the power of mechanization, organizing hundreds of tractors, self-made a large number of wooden or wire rope wasteland clearers, as well as tractor-drawn leveling devices and ridging devices, and went deep into the wasteland to open up new farms or branch farms. The area of wasteland reclaimed this year by the farms in the Shihezi Reclamation Area and the Kuytun Reclamation Area of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is equal to three and a half to four times the area reclaimed in the same period last year.

    Hotan, August 20th (Reported by this newspaper) This year, 70,000 farmers of all ethnic groups in Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang, holding high the banner of the people's commune, without asking the state for a penny of investment, and without using tractors, went deep into the Taklimakan Desert, reclaimed one million mu of fertile land, and established 43 commune-run farms. Now, more than 200,000 mu of wheat has been harvested, and the commune members have begun to eat the new grain grown for the first time on the wasteland. More than 400,000 mu of autumn crops are growing well, and a bumper harvest is expected. Preparations for the sowing of hundreds of thousands of mu of winter wheat are also being stepped up. The desolate wilderness that has been sleeping soundly for thousands of years is now full of prosperity.

    Hotan Prefecture is located in the south of the Tarim Basin, with a mild climate, long frost-free period, and abundant water, suitable for planting various crops and developing horticulture. However, due to the small amount of cultivated land, the contradiction between grain and economic crops competing for land has not been resolved. However, there are more than a dozen rivers originating from the Kunlun Mountains and running straight north into the basin, with large oases along the banks available for reclamation. This spring, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels in the Hotan area, commune members of all ethnic groups gave full play to the superiority of the people's commune "large in size and collective in nature," and went into the desert to carry out a vigorous land reclamation and production increase movement along the banks of various rivers. Because one million mu of wasteland has been reclaimed this year, the area of grain crops in the whole region has expanded by 35.2% compared with last year, cotton has expanded by 39%, and oil crops have expanded by 24%. Last year, the whole region planted more than 800,000 mu of winter wheat. This year's winter planting and next year's spring sowing of grain crops will also increase significantly.

    The people's communes in Hotan Prefecture did not ask the state for a penny of investment, nor did they have a single tractor. Relying entirely on the existing labor force within the commune, in such a difficult place, they started from scratch and reclaimed one million mu of fertile land in half a year, and built 43 farms. This is an amazing miracle. It fully reflects the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune. Under the unified leadership and unified planning of the communes, the production brigades transferred labor, livestock, farm tools, and seeds. The reclaimed wasteland belongs to the commune, and the production income belongs to the production brigade. The commune appropriates a certain percentage. This method not only gave play to the superiority of the people's commune "large in size and collective in nature," but also mobilized the enthusiasm of the production brigades for expeditionary land reclamation. Since this spring, under the unified leadership of the commune, according to the needs of the agricultural season, more than 70,000 laborers were concentrated to work hard before the spring plowing; when the spring plowing began, most of the laborers were withdrawn from the wasteland and transferred to the commune to rush planting, leaving a small number of people to level the land and repair canals. In early May, after the sowing in the commune ended, the brigades sent a large number of laborers to support the farm sowing. Afterwards, they switched to field management, leaving only professional teams to operate on the wasteland, and the remaining laborers returned to the commune for production. In this way, the labor potential has been fully exploited.

    At present, hundreds of land reclamation pioneer teams are going deep into the more distant wasteland to carry out various preparatory work. Another vigorous land reclamation movement is about to begin. (Attached picture)

    扩大耕地面积　大幅度增产粮食
    新疆半年开荒造田八百八十多万亩
    和田专区人民公社垦荒百万亩，兴办农场四十多个
    本报乌鲁木齐20日电　新疆各级党委在贯彻以农业为基础的方针中，半年多来征服了八百八十多万亩干旱荒原，提前超额完成了全年开荒计划，创造了解放十年来新疆开荒的最高速度。目前各地继续在开渠引水，开荒造田，积极准备扩大冬麦播种面积，以确保明年农业生产持续跃进。
    兴修水利和开荒造田同时并举，常年开荒和突击开荒相结合，边开荒、边播种，用不断扩大耕地面积的办法，大幅度地增产粮食和棉花，是新疆自治区党委确定的一项高速度发展农业的方针。半年来，各级党委坚决贯彻了这一方针，使各种农作物的播种面积比去年扩大了一千万亩（一部分是去冬开垦的荒地），其中粮食作物面积猛增30％以上。棉、油、瓜、菜、甜菜等各种作物的播种面积也都较去年增加了许多，其中棉花增加13％，油料增加20％以上，粮食和经济作物争地的矛盾进一步得到了解决。
    今年，新疆开荒一开始就具有全党全民的规模。各人民公社，生产建设兵团各军垦农场，地方国营农场，各级机关、学校、工矿企业、军队等各行各业都参加了这一运动。
    在开荒运动中，各人民公社和国营农场因地、因时、因人制宜，大搞群众运动。在人口较多的南疆和吐鲁番盆地一带，各人民公社在生产大忙的空隙（例如春播前后），普遍以生产大队或管理区为单位，由公社统一领导，组织大批远征队，深入原始荒原上，安营扎寨，一边开渠引水，挖坎儿井，一边开荒造田，修筑公路。
    北疆地区各人民公社，普遍采取社与社、队与队、农业区和牧业区、高寒山区和平原地区大协作办法，争取了时间，加速了开荒和播种的速度。仅有二十二万人口的塔城专区，今年采取上述办法，使全专区播种面积扩大了七十万亩。
    分布在天山南北的军垦农场和地方国营农场，还充分发挥了机械化的威力，组织了成百上千台拖拉机，自制了大批木制或钢丝绳制的打荒器以及拖拉机带的平土器、打埂器等，深入荒原，开辟新农场或分场。新疆生产建设兵团石河子垦区和奎屯垦区各农场，今年开垦的荒地，等于去年同期开荒面积的三倍半到四倍。
    本报和田20日电　新疆和田专区七万各族农民，今年高举人民公社的大旗，没有要国家一文投资，也没有用拖拉机，深入塔克拉玛干大沙漠，开垦出一百万亩良田，兴办起四十三个社办农场。现在，二十多万亩小麦已经收完，社员们开始吃到荒地上第一次长出的新粮。四十多万亩秋季作物生长良好，丰收有望。几十万亩冬麦播种的准备工作，也在加紧进行。千百年来一直沉沉入睡的万古荒原，今天充满了兴旺景象。
    和田专区位于塔里木盆地南面，气候温和，无霜期长，水量充足，适宜种植各种农作物和发展园艺事业。只是由于耕地不多，粮食和经济作物争地的矛盾一直不得解决。但是，这里有十多条发源于昆仑山向北直奔入盆地的河流，沿岸都有大片的绿洲可供开垦。今年春天，各族社员在和田地区各级党委的领导下，充分发挥人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，纷纷开进大沙漠，在各条河流两岸开展了轰轰烈烈的开荒增产运动。由于今年开出一百万亩荒地，全区粮食作物比去年扩大35.2％，棉花扩大39％，油料扩大24％。去年全区种冬麦八十多万亩。今年的冬种、明年春播的粮食作物也都有大量增加。
    和田专区各人民公社不要国家一文投资，也没有一辆拖拉机，全凭公社内部现有的劳力，在那样艰苦的地方，白手兴家，半年时间就开出一百万亩良田，建设起四十三个农场，这是一个惊人的奇迹。它充分反映出人民公社具有无比的优越性。各地在公社统一领导和统一规划下，由生产大队抽调劳力、耕畜、农具和种籽，开出的荒地归公社所有，生产收益归生产大队，公社适当提成。采用这个办法，既发挥了人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，又调动了生产大队远征开荒的积极性。今春以来，各生产大队在公社统一领导下，根据农业季节的需要，春耕以前集中七万多劳力大干；春耕开始，又从荒地上抽回大部分劳力，转入社内抢种，留下少数人整地、修渠。5月初，社内播种结束，各大队又派出大批劳力，支援农场播种。以后转入田间管理，荒地上只留下专业队经营，其余劳力又返回社内生产。这样，劳动潜力得到了充分发挥。
    目前，数以百计的开荒先遣队，正纷纷深入到更远的荒地上，进行各种准备工作，又一次轰轰烈烈的开荒造田运动，眼看就要开始了。（附图片）
