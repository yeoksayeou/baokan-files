The Yakou Brigade Has Plenty of High-Quality Fertilizer
Implementing a combination of year-round fertilizer accumulation and concentrated fertilizer campaigns, collective fertilizer accumulation and individual after-work fertilizer accumulation, mass movements and specialized teams, and political leadership and reasonable compensation, greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of commune members for fertilizer accumulation.

(Reported by Fujian Daily) Jinjiang County’s Longhu Commune’s Yakou Brigade has summarized and promoted the “four combinations” experience in fertilizer accumulation, transforming fertilizer work from passive to active.

The Yakou Brigade's "four combinations" for fertilizer accumulation are a set of successful experiences explored from several years of fertilizer work. These are: combining the establishment of fertilizer bases with the exploitation of fertilizer sources; combining collective fertilizer accumulation with individual after-work fertilizer accumulation; combining mass movements with specialized teams; and combining political leadership with reasonable compensation. After promoting this experience, the amount of fertilizer applied to early rice in the first half of this year increased by more than double compared to previous years; the quality of fertilizer has also greatly improved. At present, in addition to applying sufficient base fertilizer to early and late sweet potatoes and late rice, the team has also prepared a large amount of soil-based chemical fertilizer, granular fertilizer, mixed fertilizer, stable manure, human manure, and miscellaneous soil fertilizer, enough for the topdressing needs of more than 2,400 mu of late rice crops. Due to the abundance of accumulated fertilizer, this team has also sold a portion of soil-based chemical fertilizer to support fraternal brigades.

The Yakou Brigade is located in a coastal hilly area with abundant fertilizer sources, but in the past, it relied only on temporary concentrated fertilizer accumulation, and the fertilizer often could not meet the needs. Starting last year, the Party branch resolved to change this passive situation in fertilizer accumulation, with the Party branch secretary taking the lead in planning fertilizer work. First, four fertilizer bases were established. One is to establish a chemical fertilizer base, producing more than 20 kinds of high-quality soil-based chemical fertilizers with high fertilizer efficiency, such as Atractylodes lancea fertilizer and bittern fertilizer. The second is to establish a livestock manure base. Pigsties and cattle pens have been built for more than 870 pigs and more than 100 cattle in the team. A livestock manure management and reward and punishment system has been established. The amount of fertilizer accumulated has increased from more than 11,000 dan per month in the past to more than 19,000 dan. The third is to use open space, gaps, and field edges to establish a green manure base, planting green manure extensively, planting more than 300 mu of Sesbania cannabina, etc. The fourth is to dig large fertilizer pits and establish a compost base. The team has dug more than 800 fertilizer pits to compost and pile up waterlogged green manure. At the same time, attention is also paid to exploiting various small fertilizer sources and carrying out concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaigns. After the establishment of the fertilizer base, the team can accumulate more than 56,000 dan of refined fertilizer per month, accounting for 70% of the total amount of fertilizer applied to various crops. Due to the high quality and high fertilizer efficiency of fertilizer accumulation, less labor is required.

After the team established a fertilizer base, specialized teams were established to be responsible for operating the fertilizer base. For example, 28 people were organized to establish a fertilizer production team responsible for fertilizer production in the fertilizer plant; 80 semi-laborers were organized into a dung fertilizer accumulation team responsible for fertilizer accumulation in various livestock farms. In addition to the specialized teams insisting on year-round fertilizer accumulation and production, mass-based concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaigns were also carried out.

The team also insisted on implementing a combination of collective fertilizer accumulation and individual after-work fertilizer accumulation. The team set a fertilizer accumulation quota for each laborer, and those who exceeded the quota were given extra rewards. This further encouraged the enthusiasm of commune members for after-work fertilizer accumulation.

In order to accumulate more fertilizer and accumulate good fertilizer, the Party branch adhered to the principle of political leadership, vigorously establishing models and commending advanced individuals. At the same time, the issue of remuneration for fertilizer accumulation and production was reasonably resolved. The method is: the fertilizer accumulated by commune members collectively is assessed and recorded according to quality and quantity, with more work earning more points. The fertilizer accumulated by commune members after work is purchased by the production team in cash or assessed and recorded according to quality, quantity, and grade.

    建立化肥、畜肥、绿肥、沤肥四种基地
    衙口大队肥料量多质好
    实行常年积肥和突击积肥相结合，集体积肥和个人工余积肥相结合，群众运动和专业队相结合，政治挂帅和合理报酬相结合，大大调动了社员积肥的积极性
    本报讯　据福建日报消息：晋江县龙湖公社衙口大队总结推广了
  “四结合”的积肥经验，积肥工作从被动走向主动。
    衙口大队积肥“四结合”是从几年来积肥工作中摸索出的一套成功经验。这就是：建立肥料基地和发掘肥源相结合；集体积肥与个人工余积肥相结合；群众运动和专业队相结合；政治挂帅和合理报酬相结合。推广这个经验后，今年上半年全队早稻施肥量比往年增加一倍多；肥料质量也大大提高。目前，全队除早晚番薯、晚稻施足了基肥以外，还备好了大量的土化肥、颗粒肥、混合肥、厩肥、人粪尿和土杂肥，足够二千四百多亩晚稻作物追肥的需要。由于积肥多，这个队还卖出一部分土化肥支援兄弟大队。
    衙口大队地处沿海丘陵地带，肥源丰富，但往年都只靠临时突击积肥，肥料往往不能满足需要。从去年开始，党支部下定决心改变这种积肥被动局面，由党支部书记挂帅，统一筹划积肥工作。首先建立了四个肥料基地。一是建立化肥基地，生产肥效高的苍术肥、苦卤肥等二十多种优质土化肥。二是建立畜肥基地，全队八百七十多头猪、一百多头牛普遍修了猪圈牛栏，建立了畜肥管理与奖惩制度，积肥量由过去每月积肥一万一千多担增加到一万九千多担。三是利用空地、隙地、田边地角建立绿肥基地，大种绿肥，共种田菁等三百多亩。四是大挖肥坑、建立沤肥基地，全队挖肥坑八百多个，沤制堆肥水绿肥。与此同时，还经常注意发掘各种小肥源，开展突击积肥运动。建立肥料基地后，全队每月可积造精肥五万六千多担，占各项作物施肥总量的70％。由于积肥的质量高，肥效高，花工也少。
    队里建立肥料基地后，随着建立了专业队负责经营肥料基地。如组织二十八人建立造肥专业队负责肥料厂造肥；组织八十个半劳力的积粪肥专业队负责各畜牧场的积肥工作。除专业队坚持常年积肥造肥以外，还开展群众性的突击积肥运动。
    这个队还坚持实行集体积肥和个人工余积肥相结合的办法。队里订了每个劳力的积肥定额，超过定额的给予超额奖励。这样就进一步鼓舞了社员工余积肥的积极性。
    为了多积肥、积好肥，党支部坚持了政治挂帅的原则，大立标本，表扬先进。同时，又合理解决了积肥造肥的报酬问题，办法是：社员集体积的肥料按质按量评工记分，多劳多得，社员工余积的肥料由生产队按质按量论等定价现金收购或评工记分。
