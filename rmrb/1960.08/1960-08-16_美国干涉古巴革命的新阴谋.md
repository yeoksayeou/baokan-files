New U.S. Conspiracy to Interfere in the Cuban Revolution
Lin Longtie

The Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the member states of the "Organization of American States," controlled by the United States, began on August 16 in San Jos√©, the capital of Costa Rica. This is a new conspiracy that the United States has recently stepped up planning to rally some Latin American countries under the pretext of "anti-communism" to collectively interfere in the Cuban revolution.

In order to use this meeting of foreign ministers to interfere in Cuba, the United States made thorough preparations. As early as the end of June, the United States submitted a memorandum to the "Organization of American States," insisting that Cuba's legitimate actions to safeguard national sovereignty and oppose U.S. interference were "an important factor in creating tension in this hemisphere," laying the groundwork for interfering in Cuba. On July 13, the United States instructed Peru to request the "Organization of American States" to convene a meeting of foreign ministers to consider the issue of dealing with the so-called "international communist threat." The next day, the U.S. State Department issued two statements in succession: In the first statement, it expressed "welcome" to Peru's proposal and described Cuba's just actions to resist U.S. aggression as "a threat to the internal unity, security, and democracy of the Americas," saying that this threat "has direct and serious relations to all twenty-one countries of the [Organization of American States]," attempting to politically and morally isolate Cuba; in the second statement, it shamelessly slandered the Soviet Union's support for Cuba's position against U.S. aggression as "interfering in the affairs of other countries," clamoring that the United States should insist on the "Monroe Doctrine" that only it is allowed to invade Latin America and no other country is allowed to stop such aggression, thereby advocating the use of the entire set of intervention tools of the "Inter-American Security System" to strangle the Cuban revolution.

Although Cuba requested that condemnation of the U.S.'s military and economic aggression against Cuba be included in the agenda of this meeting and firmly opposed discussing the so-called "communist threat" at the meeting, the Council of the "Organization of American States," under U.S. manipulation, forcibly passed the four-point agenda formulated by the United States for interfering in Cuba, the so-called "defending the American continent from the threat of international communism," and the so-called strengthening of the "Inter-American System" and "collective action" to oppose the "threat of foreign interference," maintaining the so-called "democratic system" and "preventing subversive activities" are precisely the excuses that the United States has always used to interfere in Cuba. It is worth noting that on the eve of the meeting, the United States instigated the Guatemalan government to submit to the "Organization of American States" written materials on Cuba's "illegal interference activities" against it, requesting "discussion" at the meeting of foreign ministers. At the same time, the United States also submitted to this organization a lengthy report on the so-called "responsibility of the Cuban government for the intensification of international tensions in this hemisphere," falsely accusing Cuba of being a "dictatorial regime" and a tool used by the so-called communist countries to "carry out subversive activities around the world," etc. This is obviously to provide evidence for fabricating the so-called "communist threat," "anti-democratic," and "aggression" charges against Cuba. U.S. Secretary of State Herter publicly stated at a press conference on the 9th that he would use the Caracas anti-communist declaration to deal with Cuba. Everyone knows that in 1954, the United States used the excuse of opposing "communism" to armedly subvert the democratic government of Guatemala. All these activities of the United States fully exposed the sinister conspiracy of the United States to use this meeting to plan interference in the Cuban revolution.

This meeting of foreign ministers will also discuss Venezuela's accusation against the Dominican dictatorship for the assassination attempt on the president. This is actually also part of the U.S.'s conspiracy to interfere in Cuba. Just as Cuban Prime Minister Castro pointed out as early as June, the U.S.'s activities against the Dominican dictatorship within the "Organization of American States" are only to create a precedent for intervention, and then use the same means to interfere in Cuba. The United States has repeatedly slandered Cuba as a "dictatorial regime," precisely to create an excuse for intervention.

At this meeting of foreign ministers, the United States also conspired to organize the so-called "Pan-American police force."

U.S. Secretary of State Herter announced in July that the United States would request the Organization of American States for a "Pan-American police force" controlled by the United States, as a tool for interfering in the Cuban revolution and suppressing the national democratic movements of other countries. This was originally a plan to interfere in Cuba that the United States had been planning since the victory of the Cuban revolution. The U.S. Congress even allocated 39 million U.S. dollars for this purpose. U.S. Senator Smathers, who has consistently advocated the establishment of this "police force," once bluntly stated that the purpose of establishing the "Pan-American police force" is because "Cuba's development does not meet our hopes." The "New York Herald Tribune" also confessed that if the "Pan-American police force" is established, the "benefits the United States will receive from this" is, first of all, that when launching armed attacks on other countries, it will not "appear that the United States is interfering in the internal affairs of another country." However, the U.S.'s plan to establish a "Pan-American police force" has been opposed by Latin American countries. This year, the United States again used the name of helping "improve the economic and social levels of the people of the Western Hemisphere" to lure countries into supporting this plan in the name of "supporting" Latin American countries' "disarmament" and "saving military expenses." Eisenhower also personally peddled it during his visit to South America. U.S. Senator Smathers also went to South America to lobby, requesting that the armies of Latin American countries be replaced by the Organization of American States forces, and that the United States be responsible for Latin American "defense," attempting to disarm the self-defense forces of various countries, especially Cuba, and let the "Pan-American police force" controlled by the United States act as the gendarme to suppress the Cuban revolution and the Latin American national democratic movement. The United States now hopes that this plan can be passed at the Pan-American Foreign Ministers' Meeting.

At the same time, under the guise of helping "improve the economic and social level of the people of the Western Hemisphere," the United States announced a so-called "Marshall Plan for the Western Hemisphere," preparing to discuss it at this meeting. The U.S. government will provide 600 million U.S. dollars to promote this plan. U.S. Senator Mansfield admitted that this plan is "related to the U.S.'s troubles with Cuba" and is a "ruthless attempt to buy goodwill in Latin America when we [the United States] need goodwill," which shows that the United States is also attempting to use U.S. "aid" as bait to split the relations between Latin American countries and Cuba and lure them into supporting the conspiracy to interfere in Cuba at this meeting.

However, it is not an easy task for the United States to use the "Organization of American States" to interfere in the Cuban revolution. The "Organization of American States" has already been widely recognized in Latin America as a tool for the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries. Former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs Rubottom once boasted that the United States "has the Organization of American States as an effective police force" in suppressing the people of Latin America. After the war, the United States used the "Organization of American States" to coerce Latin American countries into signing a series of treaties, tightly controlling these countries in its own hands. The "Rio de Janeiro Treaty" passed in 1947 stipulates that if any American country is subjected to "armed attack," "aggression by non-armed attack," or "threat," the countries should agree on "individual or collective self-defense," "joint defense," or the measures to be taken. The "Charter of the Organization of American States" was passed in 1948, officially stipulating in its articles that the organization's task is to consolidate the "peace" and "security" of the Latin American continent and to arrange joint action to deal with "aggression," etc. In 1954, the "Caracas Anti-Communist Declaration" was further passed, stipulating that a so-called "political system outside the continent" established by an American country is "endangering American peace," and that countries must "take appropriate actions in accordance with existing treaties," formally assigning the organization the task of anti-communism. For nearly half a century, only U.S. imperialism has continuously invaded and interfered in Latin American countries. The so-called foreign "aggression" or "threat" is a completely fabricated fabrication. The aforementioned treaties essentially give the United States a legal basis for suppressing the Latin American people and interfering in the internal affairs of various countries, thereby strengthening the U.S.'s political control over Latin America, because if the people of any Latin American country dare to rise up to fight for independence and democracy and oppose U.S. enslavement and exploitation, the United States can invoke these treaties at will, using a "foreign aggression" or "communist threat" as an excuse to coerce other countries to participate in suppressing the revolutionary movement of that country and subverting governments that do not suit the U.S. From 1948 to 1958, the United States instigated fourteen major subversion activities in Latin America. The "Organization of American States" not only failed to protect the "security" of these countries, but instead covered up or even participated in the U.S.'s interference activities. For example, after the United States subverted the legitimate governments of Peru, Venezuela, and Costa Rica in 1948, it forced various countries to recognize the new reactionary regimes through this organization. In 1954, the United States subverted the democratic government of Guatemala under the cover of the Caracas Anti-Communist Declaration. At that time, the Guatemalan government requested the United Nations Security Council to stop the U.S. aggression, but the United States manipulated the Security Council to transfer the issue to the "Organization of American States" for discussion. Under U.S. control, this organization did not take any measures, and the democratic government of Guatemala was thus subverted.

In the past year or so, the United States has tried to use the "Organization of American States" to interfere in the Cuban revolution. In June last year, the United States fabricated the so-called Cuban "invasion" of Panama, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and other countries, falsely accusing Cuba of "interfering" in these countries, thereby convening a special meeting of American countries and organizing an "investigation committee" to conduct investigations in Central American countries. This conspiracy was declared bankrupt due to the Cuban government's firm opposition and the condemnation of the Latin American people. The United States again manipulated the meeting of foreign ministers of the American countries in August, passing the Santiago Declaration, which opposed "international communism and any other totalitarianism," and authorized the so-called "Pan-American Peace Committee" to "review" the tense situation in the Caribbean region in order to create a legal basis for U.S. intervention in Cuba. The Cuban representative resolutely struggled against the U.S.'s intervention conspiracy at the meeting. Under the strong public opinion pressure of the Latin American people, some participating countries' representatives had to oppose U.S. interference in internal affairs, so the meeting did not "condemn" Cuba according to U.S. intentions, nor did it pass the U.S.'s proposed establishment of a "supervisory committee" to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries. The United States, fearing the opposition of the representatives of various countries, did not dare to propose the establishment of a "Pan-American police force" to interfere in the Cuban plan.

Since this year, under the heroic resistance of the Cuban people, various U.S. intervention actions have repeatedly failed. Especially after the economic big stick, which the United States considered its most effective weapon, also failed, the U.S. ruling clique, in addition to actively preparing for armed intervention, has stepped up its use of the "Organization of American States" to convene this meeting of foreign ministers in order to collectively interfere in the Cuban revolution and pave the way for armed intervention.

At the meeting of foreign ministers of the American countries in August last year, a fierce struggle between intervention and anti-intervention unfolded around the Cuban issue. In the year since then, the entire international situation has continued to develop in a direction favorable to the Cuban people's struggle, the Cuban revolution has continued to advance, the aggressive and predatory nature of U.S. imperialism has continued to be greatly exposed, and the awareness and unity of the Cuban and Latin American people have been greatly enhanced and strengthened. What the United States failed to do a year ago is even more difficult now. The Cuban government, with the support of the people of the whole country, is resolutely prepared to smash the new U.S. intervention conspiracy. Prime Minister Castro pointed out on the 7th, when condemning the United States' conspiracy to use the "Organization of American States" to destroy the Cuban revolution, that the Cuban revolution does not exist because of the approval of the Organization of American States. The Cuban revolution is a reality that has not been approved by Washington and the Organization of American States, that is to say, regardless of Washington and the Organization of American States, the Cuban revolution will continue to be a profound reality. He also made it clear that Cuba will accuse and condemn the U.S.'s crimes of aggression against Cuba and Latin America at the American Foreign Ministers' Meeting. At the same time, Cuban Foreign Minister Roa also announced that Cuba will not accept any resolutions passed by the Organization of American States that endanger the Cuban government. Public opinion in Latin American countries unanimously condemned the U.S.'s conspiracy to use the "Organization of American States" to interfere in the Cuban revolution. The Cuban people's just struggle to defend the freedom of their motherland is winning more and more support. At present, the people of the entire Latin America are launching a powerful movement to support and defend Cuba and oppose U.S. intervention, resolutely opposing the U.S.'s use of the Organization of American States to interfere in Cuba, and also resolutely not allowing their own governments to act as accomplices of the United States. Therefore, even the U.S. "Time" magazine had to admit that "a government that votes to condemn Castro in the Organization of American States risks arousing the anger of its own people." Although the United States is currently stepping up its use of vile means such as coercion and bribery, governments must also consider the strong public opinion pressure of their own people before taking action. Therefore, during this meeting of foreign ministers, the struggle between intervention and anti-intervention, centered on the Cuban revolution, will be unprecedentedly sharp, both inside and outside the meeting. The U.S.'s attempt to win over Latin American countries to collectively interfere in Cuba will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the Latin American people. Even if the United States, under pressure and inducement on the governments of some countries, forcibly makes this meeting pass resolutions that are conducive to the U.S.'s future intervention in Cuba, this can only further expose the ferocious face of U.S. imperialism, educate the Cuban and Latin American people from the opposite side, and arouse an even stronger high tide of anti-American struggle.
