New U.S. Conspiracy to Interfere in the Cuban Revolution
Lin Longtie

The Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the member states of the "Organization of American States," controlled by the United States, began on August 16 in San José, the capital of Costa Rica. This is a new conspiracy that the United States has recently stepped up planning to rally some Latin American countries under the pretext of "anti-communism" to collectively interfere in the Cuban revolution.

In order to use this meeting of foreign ministers to interfere in Cuba, the United States made thorough preparations. As early as the end of June, the United States submitted a memorandum to the "Organization of American States," insisting that Cuba's legitimate actions to safeguard national sovereignty and oppose U.S. interference were "an important factor in creating tension in this hemisphere," laying the groundwork for interfering in Cuba. On July 13, the United States instructed Peru to request the "Organization of American States" to convene a meeting of foreign ministers to consider the issue of dealing with the so-called "international communist threat." The next day, the U.S. State Department issued two statements in succession: In the first statement, it expressed "welcome" to Peru's proposal and described Cuba's just actions to resist U.S. aggression as "a threat to the internal unity, security, and democracy of the Americas," saying that this threat "has direct and serious relations to all twenty-one countries of the [Organization of American States]," attempting to politically and morally isolate Cuba; in the second statement, it shamelessly slandered the Soviet Union's support for Cuba's position against U.S. aggression as "interfering in the affairs of other countries," clamoring that the United States should insist on the "Monroe Doctrine" that only it is allowed to invade Latin America and no other country is allowed to stop such aggression, thereby advocating the use of the entire set of intervention tools of the "Inter-American Security System" to strangle the Cuban revolution.

Although Cuba requested that condemnation of the U.S.'s military and economic aggression against Cuba be included in the agenda of this meeting and firmly opposed discussing the so-called "communist threat" at the meeting, the Council of the "Organization of American States," under U.S. manipulation, forcibly passed the four-point agenda formulated by the United States for interfering in Cuba, the so-called "defending the American continent from the threat of international communism," and the so-called strengthening of the "Inter-American System" and "collective action" to oppose the "threat of foreign interference," maintaining the so-called "democratic system" and "preventing subversive activities" are precisely the excuses that the United States has always used to interfere in Cuba. It is worth noting that on the eve of the meeting, the United States instigated the Guatemalan government to submit to the "Organization of American States" written materials on Cuba's "illegal interference activities" against it, requesting "discussion" at the meeting of foreign ministers. At the same time, the United States also submitted to this organization a lengthy report on the so-called "responsibility of the Cuban government for the intensification of international tensions in this hemisphere," falsely accusing Cuba of being a "dictatorial regime" and a tool used by the so-called communist countries to "carry out subversive activities around the world," etc. This is obviously to provide evidence for fabricating the so-called "communist threat," "anti-democratic," and "aggression" charges against Cuba. U.S. Secretary of State Herter publicly stated at a press conference on the 9th that he would use the Caracas anti-communist declaration to deal with Cuba. Everyone knows that in 1954, the United States used the excuse of opposing "communism" to armedly subvert the democratic government of Guatemala. All these activities of the United States fully exposed the sinister conspiracy of the United States to use this meeting to plan interference in the Cuban revolution.

This meeting of foreign ministers will also discuss Venezuela's accusation against the Dominican dictatorship for the assassination attempt on the president. This is actually also part of the U.S.'s conspiracy to interfere in Cuba. Just as Cuban Prime Minister Castro pointed out as early as June, the U.S.'s activities against the Dominican dictatorship within the "Organization of American States" are only to create a precedent for intervention, and then use the same means to interfere in Cuba. The United States has repeatedly slandered Cuba as a "dictatorial regime," precisely to create an excuse for intervention.

At this meeting of foreign ministers, the United States also conspired to organize the so-called "Pan-American police force."

U.S. Secretary of State Herter announced in July that the United States would request the Organization of American States for a "Pan-American police force" controlled by the United States, as a tool for interfering in the Cuban revolution and suppressing the national democratic movements of other countries. This was originally a plan to interfere in Cuba that the United States had been planning since the victory of the Cuban revolution. The U.S. Congress even allocated 39 million U.S. dollars for this purpose. U.S. Senator Smathers, who has consistently advocated the establishment of this "police force," once bluntly stated that the purpose of establishing the "Pan-American police force" is because "Cuba's development does not meet our hopes." The "New York Herald Tribune" also confessed that if the "Pan-American police force" is established, the "benefits the United States will receive from this" is, first of all, that when launching armed attacks on other countries, it will not "appear that the United States is interfering in the internal affairs of another country." However, the U.S.'s plan to establish a "Pan-American police force" has been opposed by Latin American countries. This year, the United States again used the name of helping "improve the economic and social levels of the people of the Western Hemisphere" to lure countries into supporting this plan in the name of "supporting" Latin American countries' "disarmament" and "saving military expenses." Eisenhower also personally peddled it during his visit to South America. U.S. Senator Smathers also went to South America to lobby, requesting that the armies of Latin American countries be replaced by the Organization of American States forces, and that the United States be responsible for Latin American "defense," attempting to disarm the self-defense forces of various countries, especially Cuba, and let the "Pan-American police force" controlled by the United States act as the gendarme to suppress the Cuban revolution and the Latin American national democratic movement. The United States now hopes that this plan can be passed at the Pan-American Foreign Ministers' Meeting.

At the same time, under the guise of helping "improve the economic and social level of the people of the Western Hemisphere," the United States announced a so-called "Marshall Plan for the Western Hemisphere," preparing to discuss it at this meeting. The U.S. government will provide 600 million U.S. dollars to promote this plan. U.S. Senator Mansfield admitted that this plan is "related to the U.S.'s troubles with Cuba" and is a "ruthless attempt to buy goodwill in Latin America when we [the United States] need goodwill," which shows that the United States is also attempting to use U.S. "aid" as bait to split the relations between Latin American countries and Cuba and lure them into supporting the conspiracy to interfere in Cuba at this meeting.

However, it is not an easy task for the United States to use the "Organization of American States" to interfere in the Cuban revolution. The "Organization of American States" has already been widely recognized in Latin America as a tool for the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries. Former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs Rubottom once boasted that the United States "has the Organization of American States as an effective police force" in suppressing the people of Latin America. After the war, the United States used the "Organization of American States" to coerce Latin American countries into signing a series of treaties, tightly controlling these countries in its own hands. The "Rio de Janeiro Treaty" passed in 1947 stipulates that if any American country is subjected to "armed attack," "aggression by non-armed attack," or "threat," the countries should agree on "individual or collective self-defense," "joint defense," or the measures to be taken. The "Charter of the Organization of American States" was passed in 1948, officially stipulating in its articles that the organization's task is to consolidate the "peace" and "security" of the Latin American continent and to arrange joint action to deal with "aggression," etc. In 1954, the "Caracas Anti-Communist Declaration" was further passed, stipulating that a so-called "political system outside the continent" established by an American country is "endangering American peace," and that countries must "take appropriate actions in accordance with existing treaties," formally assigning the organization the task of anti-communism. For nearly half a century, only U.S. imperialism has continuously invaded and interfered in Latin American countries. The so-called foreign "aggression" or "threat" is a completely fabricated fabrication. The aforementioned treaties essentially give the United States a legal basis for suppressing the Latin American people and interfering in the internal affairs of various countries, thereby strengthening the U.S.'s political control over Latin America, because if the people of any Latin American country dare to rise up to fight for independence and democracy and oppose U.S. enslavement and exploitation, the United States can invoke these treaties at will, using a "foreign aggression" or "communist threat" as an excuse to coerce other countries to participate in suppressing the revolutionary movement of that country and subverting governments that do not suit the U.S. From 1948 to 1958, the United States instigated fourteen major subversion activities in Latin America. The "Organization of American States" not only failed to protect the "security" of these countries, but instead covered up or even participated in the U.S.'s interference activities. For example, after the United States subverted the legitimate governments of Peru, Venezuela, and Costa Rica in 1948, it forced various countries to recognize the new reactionary regimes through this organization. In 1954, the United States subverted the democratic government of Guatemala under the cover of the Caracas Anti-Communist Declaration. At that time, the Guatemalan government requested the United Nations Security Council to stop the U.S. aggression, but the United States manipulated the Security Council to transfer the issue to the "Organization of American States" for discussion. Under U.S. control, this organization did not take any measures, and the democratic government of Guatemala was thus subverted.

In the past year or so, the United States has tried to use the "Organization of American States" to interfere in the Cuban revolution. In June last year, the United States fabricated the so-called Cuban "invasion" of Panama, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and other countries, falsely accusing Cuba of "interfering" in these countries, thereby convening a special meeting of American countries and organizing an "investigation committee" to conduct investigations in Central American countries. This conspiracy was declared bankrupt due to the Cuban government's firm opposition and the condemnation of the Latin American people. The United States again manipulated the meeting of foreign ministers of the American countries in August, passing the Santiago Declaration, which opposed "international communism and any other totalitarianism," and authorized the so-called "Pan-American Peace Committee" to "review" the tense situation in the Caribbean region in order to create a legal basis for U.S. intervention in Cuba. The Cuban representative resolutely struggled against the U.S.'s intervention conspiracy at the meeting. Under the strong public opinion pressure of the Latin American people, some participating countries' representatives had to oppose U.S. interference in internal affairs, so the meeting did not "condemn" Cuba according to U.S. intentions, nor did it pass the U.S.'s proposed establishment of a "supervisory committee" to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries. The United States, fearing the opposition of the representatives of various countries, did not dare to propose the establishment of a "Pan-American police force" to interfere in the Cuban plan.

Since this year, under the heroic resistance of the Cuban people, various U.S. intervention actions have repeatedly failed. Especially after the economic big stick, which the United States considered its most effective weapon, also failed, the U.S. ruling clique, in addition to actively preparing for armed intervention, has stepped up its use of the "Organization of American States" to convene this meeting of foreign ministers in order to collectively interfere in the Cuban revolution and pave the way for armed intervention.

At the meeting of foreign ministers of the American countries in August last year, a fierce struggle between intervention and anti-intervention unfolded around the Cuban issue. In the year since then, the entire international situation has continued to develop in a direction favorable to the Cuban people's struggle, the Cuban revolution has continued to advance, the aggressive and predatory nature of U.S. imperialism has continued to be greatly exposed, and the awareness and unity of the Cuban and Latin American people have been greatly enhanced and strengthened. What the United States failed to do a year ago is even more difficult now. The Cuban government, with the support of the people of the whole country, is resolutely prepared to smash the new U.S. intervention conspiracy. Prime Minister Castro pointed out on the 7th, when condemning the United States' conspiracy to use the "Organization of American States" to destroy the Cuban revolution, that the Cuban revolution does not exist because of the approval of the Organization of American States. The Cuban revolution is a reality that has not been approved by Washington and the Organization of American States, that is to say, regardless of Washington and the Organization of American States, the Cuban revolution will continue to be a profound reality. He also made it clear that Cuba will accuse and condemn the U.S.'s crimes of aggression against Cuba and Latin America at the American Foreign Ministers' Meeting. At the same time, Cuban Foreign Minister Roa also announced that Cuba will not accept any resolutions passed by the Organization of American States that endanger the Cuban government. Public opinion in Latin American countries unanimously condemned the U.S.'s conspiracy to use the "Organization of American States" to interfere in the Cuban revolution. The Cuban people's just struggle to defend the freedom of their motherland is winning more and more support. At present, the people of the entire Latin America are launching a powerful movement to support and defend Cuba and oppose U.S. intervention, resolutely opposing the U.S.'s use of the Organization of American States to interfere in Cuba, and also resolutely not allowing their own governments to act as accomplices of the United States. Therefore, even the U.S. "Time" magazine had to admit that "a government that votes to condemn Castro in the Organization of American States risks arousing the anger of its own people." Although the United States is currently stepping up its use of vile means such as coercion and bribery, governments must also consider the strong public opinion pressure of their own people before taking action. Therefore, during this meeting of foreign ministers, the struggle between intervention and anti-intervention, centered on the Cuban revolution, will be unprecedentedly sharp, both inside and outside the meeting. The U.S.'s attempt to win over Latin American countries to collectively interfere in Cuba will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the Latin American people. Even if the United States, under pressure and inducement on the governments of some countries, forcibly makes this meeting pass resolutions that are conducive to the U.S.'s future intervention in Cuba, this can only further expose the ferocious face of U.S. imperialism, educate the Cuban and Latin American people from the opposite side, and arouse an even stronger high tide of anti-American struggle.

    美国干涉古巴革命的新阴谋
    林龙铁
    由美国控制的“美洲国家组织”的成员国外长会议从8月16日起在哥斯达黎加首都圣约瑟举行。这是美国最近加紧策划的在“反共”的借口下企图拉拢一些拉丁美洲国家集体干涉古巴革命的一个新阴谋。
    美国为了利用这次外长会议干涉古巴，做了周密的准备工作。早在6月底，美国就向“美洲国家组织”提出一个备忘录，硬说古巴维护民族主权、反对美国干涉的正当行动是“造成这个半球紧张局势重要因素”，为干涉古巴预埋伏笔。7月13日，美国指使秘鲁要求“美洲国家组织”召开外长会议，来考虑对付所谓“国际共产主义威胁”问题。在第二天，美国国务院一连发表两项声明：在第一项声明中，对秘鲁的提议表示“欢迎”，并把古巴反抗美国侵略的正义行动说成是“对美洲内部团结、安全和民主的威胁”，说这种威胁“对（‘美洲国家组织’的）所有二十一个国家都有直接的和严重的关系”，企图借此在政治上和道义上孤立古巴；在第二项声明中，无耻地诬蔑苏联支持古巴反对美国侵略的立场是“干涉其他国家事务”，叫嚣美国要坚持只许它侵略拉丁美洲而不准其他国家制止这种侵略的“门罗主义”，借此鼓吹利用“泛美安全体系”的全套干涉工具来扼杀古巴革命。
    尽管古巴要求把谴责美国对古巴的军事和经济侵略列入这次会议议程，坚决反对在会上讨论所谓“共产主义威胁”问题，“美洲国家组织”理事会在美国操纵下，强行通过美国为干涉古巴制订的所谓“保卫美洲大陆防止国际共产主义威胁”的四点议程，而议程中的所谓加强“泛美体系”和“集体行动”来反对“外来干涉威胁”，维护所谓“民主制度”和“防止颠覆活动”等内容，正是美国一贯采用的干涉古巴的借口。值得注意的是，在会议召开前夕，美国又唆使危地马拉政府向“美洲国家组织”提出古巴对它进行“非法干涉活动”的书面材料，要求在外长会议上“讨论”。同时美国也向这个组织提出所谓“古巴政府对这个半球的国际紧张局势加剧的责任”的长篇报告，诬蔑古巴是“独裁政权”，被所谓共产党国家利用来“在全世界进行颠覆活动”的工具等。这显然是为了给古巴制造所谓“共产主义威胁”、“反民主”及“侵略”等罪名提供证明，美国国务卿赫脱9日在记者招待会上并公然表示要使用加拉加斯反共宣言对付古巴。大家知道1954年美国就是在反对“共产主义”的借口下武装颠覆危地马拉民主政府的。所有美国的这些活动，充分暴露了美国企图利用这次会议策划干涉古巴革命的罪恶阴谋。
    这次外长会议还要讨论委内瑞拉就总统被刺事件对多米尼加独裁政权的控诉。这实际上也是美国干涉古巴阴谋的一部分。正像古巴总理卡斯特罗早在6月间就已指出的，美国在“美洲国家组织”内搞反对多米尼加独裁政权的活动，只是为了制造干涉先例，然后再用同一手段干涉古巴。美国一再诬蔑古巴是“独裁政权”，正是为了制造干涉的口实。
    在这次外长会议上，美国还阴谋组织所谓“泛美警察部队”。
    美国国务卿赫脱在7月间就已宣布，美国将要求美洲国家组织一支由美国控制的“泛美警察部队”，作为干涉古巴革命和镇压其他国家民族民主运动的工具。这本来是古巴革命胜利后美国所一直策划的一项干涉古巴的计划。美国国会还特地为此拨了三千九百万美元作为经费。一贯鼓吹建立这支“警察部队”的美国参议员斯马瑟斯曾露骨说过，建立“泛美警察部队”的目的是由于“古巴的发展不符合我们的希望”。“纽约先驱论坛报”也供认，如果建立了“泛美警察部队”，“美国由此得到的好处”，首先是在武装进攻别国时，不致于“显得美国在干涉另一国内政”。但是，美国阴谋建立“泛美警察部队”的计划一直遭到拉丁美洲国家的反对。今年美国又以“支持”拉丁美洲国家“裁军”和“节约军费”为名，诱骗各国支持这项计划。艾森豪威尔访问南美时并曾亲自进行兜售。美国参议员斯马瑟斯也奔赴南美游说，要求拉丁美洲国家军队由美洲国家组织部队代替，并由美国负责拉丁美洲“防务”，妄图解除各国首先是古巴的自卫武装，让美国控制的“泛美警察部队”来充当镇压古巴革命和拉丁美洲民族民主运动的宪兵。美国现在指望这个计划能在泛美外长会议上得到通过。
    与此同时，美国在所谓帮助“提高西半球各国人民的经济和社会水平”幌子下，宣布一项所谓“西半球马歇尔计划”，准备在这次会议上讨论，美国政府将拿出六亿美元来推行这项计划。美国参议员曼斯菲尔德承认，这项计划与美国“同古巴的麻烦有关”，并且是一种“在我们（美国）需要好感时在拉丁美洲收买好感的无情的企图”，这表明了美国还企图利用美“援”为饵，来分化拉丁美洲国家同古巴关系，诱骗它们在这次会议上支持干涉古巴的阴谋。
    但是，美国利用“美洲国家组织”来干涉古巴革命，也不是一件容易的事情。“美洲国家组织”在拉丁美洲已经是众所公认的美国干涉拉丁美洲国家内政的工具了。美国前任拉丁美洲事务助理国务卿鲁博特姆曾经夸口说，美国在镇压拉丁美洲人民方面“有美洲国家组织作为有效的警察力量”。战后美国利用“美洲国家组织”胁迫拉丁美洲各国签订了一系列条约，把这些国家牢牢地控制在自己的手中。1947年通过的“里约热内卢公约”，规定任何一个美洲国家受到“武装进攻”“非武装攻击之侵略”或“威胁”，各国应商定“单独或集体自卫”、“共同防御”或所需采取的措施。1948年又通过“美洲国家组织宪章”，正式以条文规定这个组织的任务为巩固拉丁美洲大陆的“和平”与“安全”，安排共同行动对付“侵略”等。1954年进一步通过“加拉加斯反共宣言”，规定一个美洲国家建立所谓“大陆以外的政治制度”，就是“危害美洲和平”，各国必须“根据现存条约采取适当行动”，正式指派这个组织反共任务。近半个世纪以来，只有美帝国主义不断侵略和干涉拉丁美洲国家，所谓外来“侵略”或“威胁”都是无中生有的捏造。上述这些条约实质上是赋予美国镇压拉丁美洲人民、干涉各国内政以法律根据，从而加强了美国对拉丁美洲的政治控制，因为，任何一个拉丁美洲国家的人民，如果敢于起来争取独立和民主，反对美国奴役和剥削，美国就可援用这些条约随意借口一个“外国侵略”或“共产主义威胁”，要挟其他国家参加镇压这个国家的革命运动，颠覆不合美国心意的政府。从1948年到1958年，美国在拉丁美洲策动了十四次重大颠覆活动，“美洲国家组织”不仅没有保护这些国家的“安全”，反而掩护甚至参加了美国的干涉活动。例如，1948年美国颠覆秘鲁、委内瑞拉和哥斯达黎加合法政府后，又通过这个组织强迫各国承认新的反动政权。1954年美国在加拉加斯反共宣言掩护下颠覆危地马拉民主政府。当时危地马拉政府要求联合国安全理事会制止美国侵略，美国却操纵安理会把问题转交“美洲国家组织”讨论，在美国控制下这个组织并未采取措施，危地马拉民主政府就这样被颠覆了。
    一年多来，美国力图利用“美洲国家组织”干涉古巴革命。去年6月间，美国制造所谓古巴“入侵”巴拿马、尼加拉瓜、危地马拉等国事件，诬告古巴“干涉”这些国家，借此召开美洲国家特别会议，并组织“调查委员会”到中美洲国家进行调查。这项阴谋由于古巴政府的坚决反对和拉丁美洲人民的谴责而宣告破产。美国又在8月间操纵美洲国家外长会议，通过所谓反对“国际共产主义和其它任何极权主义”的圣地亚哥宣言，并授权所谓“泛美和平委员会”“审查”加勒比海地区紧张局势，以便为美国干涉古巴制造合法根据。古巴的代表在会上同美国的干涉阴谋坚决进行了斗争。在拉丁美洲人民强大舆论压力下，一些与会国家代表也不得不反对美国干涉内政，因此会议并未按美国意图“谴责”古巴，也没有通过美国提出的建立“监督委员会”干涉各国内政的建议，美国因慑于各国代表反对，也不敢提出建立“泛美警察部队”干涉古巴计划。
    今年以来，在古巴人民英勇反击下，美国各种干涉行动连遭失败，特别被美国认为最得力的武器经济大棒也失效后，美国统治集团在积极进行武装干涉的准备工作外，加紧利用“美洲国家组织”召开这次外长会议，以便集体干涉古巴革命，并为武装干涉铺平道路。
    在去年8月的美洲国家外长会议上，在围绕着古巴问题上展开了干涉和反干涉的激烈斗争。一年以来，整个国际局势在继续向有利于古巴人民的斗争方向发展，古巴革命在继续前进，美帝国主义的侵略和掠夺本性在继续大暴露，古巴和拉丁美洲人民的觉悟和团结在大大提高和加强，一年前美国没有做到的，现在就更不容易了。古巴政府在全国人民支持下，坚决准备粉碎美国新的干涉阴谋。卡斯特罗总理7日在谴责美国利用“美洲国家组织”阴谋摧毁古巴革命时指出，古巴革命并不是由于美洲国家组织的批准才存在的。古巴革命是没有得到华盛顿和美洲国家组织批准的现实，也就是说，不管华盛顿和美洲国家组织如何，古巴革命将继续是一个深刻的现实。他还表明，古巴将在美洲外长会议上控诉和谴责美国对古巴以及对拉丁美洲的侵略罪行。同时，古巴外长罗亚也宣布，古巴将不接受美洲国家组织通过的、危害古巴政府的任何决议。拉丁美洲各国舆论一致谴责美国利用“美洲国家组织”干涉古巴革命的阴谋。古巴人民保卫祖国自由的正义斗争是得道多助的，目前整个拉丁美洲的人民正掀起一个支援和保卫古巴、反对美国干涉的强大运动，坚决反对美国利用美洲国家组织干涉古巴，也决不允许本国政府充当美国帮凶。因此连美国“时代”周刊也不得不认为，
  “一国政府如果在美洲国家组织投票谴责卡斯特罗，就有激起本国人民愤怒的危险”，尽管美国目前加紧采取威逼利诱等卑劣手段，但是各国政府在行动前也必须考虑本国人民强大舆论压力。因此，这次外长会议期间，以古巴革命为中心的干涉和反干涉的斗争，不论会内和会外，都将空前尖锐，美国企图拉拢拉丁美洲国家集体干涉古巴的阴谋必将遭到拉丁美洲人民的坚决反对。即使在美国对某些国家的政府施加压力和利诱之下，强使这次会议通过有利于美国今后干涉古巴的决议，这也只能更加暴露美国的帝国主义凶恶面目，从反面教育古巴和拉丁美洲人民，并激起更加强大的反美斗争的高潮。
