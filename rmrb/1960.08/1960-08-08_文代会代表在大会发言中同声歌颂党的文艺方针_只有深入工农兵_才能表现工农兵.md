Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: The Third Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers continued its plenary session speeches this afternoon. Today, Ba Jin, Li Huanzhi, Ding Shi'e, Zunong Hadier, Guo Ming, Huang Shengxiao, and Zaxi Dunzhu, used vivid facts to illustrate from different angles the importance of literary and art workers throwing themselves into the fiery struggle of life, learning from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and transforming their worldviews. Their speeches powerfully demonstrated that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can the literature and art of all nationalities in our country achieve vigorous development.

Writer Ba Jin delivered a speech entitled "Literature Must Run Ahead of the Times." He said that as "engineers of the soul," writers must catch up with this rapidly advancing era, must throw themselves into intense creative labor, must write and refine constantly, and must quickly reflect the large number of emerging advanced things in their works, striving to create amazing miracles in the literary field. This veteran writer used his own decades of creative experience to illustrate the importance of writers transforming their worldviews and thoughts. He said that without a correct worldview, one cannot master new creative methods to express new people, new life, and new morality, one cannot recognize what is the mainstream in real life, one will confuse phenomena with essence, and even fail to distinguish between emerging forces and decadent forces.

Composer Li Huanzhi delivered a speech on the nationalization and popularization of musical creation. Based on his own experience in musical creation, he believes that to achieve nationalization and popularization in creation, music workers must first transform their worldviews, earnestly learn from the working people, and take the masses as their teachers.

Hu opera actress Ding Shi'e used vivid examples in her speech to illustrate that only by undergoing self-transformation under the influence of the noble qualities of the workers, peasants, and soldiers can one generate the thoughts and feelings of loving and representing them, and create images of heroic figures. She mentioned that when she went to the front-line outposts in Fujian for a performance on New Year's Eve in 1959, she heard moving stories about the sentries holding their guns tightly in the face of a force 12 typhoon, holding onto each other when one couldn't hold on, and fighting the wind together, which deeply moved her and made her further realize the great significance of the Party's teaching that literary and art workers should throw themselves into the fiery struggle of life.

Uyghur writer Zunong Hadier used the example of the lack of a clear class stance in some of his previous works to illustrate that a writer and artist must diligently study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, firmly establish a proletarian worldview, and go deep into the masses for a long time, laboring and living with workers and peasants, in order to create works loved by the working people.

Guangxi representative Guo Ming said in his speech entitled "A Great Mass Literary and Art Movement" that the successful creation and performance of the song and dance drama "Liu Sanjie" was entirely a victory for implementing the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers,

    文代会代表在大会发言中同声歌颂党的文艺方针
    只有深入工农兵　才能表现工农兵
    据新华社7日讯　中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会，今天下午继续进行大会发言。今天发言的巴金、李焕之、丁是娥、祖农·哈迪尔、郭铭、黄声孝、札西顿珠，用生动的事实，从不同的角度说明文艺工作者投入火热的斗争生活、向工农兵群众学习、改造世界观的重要意义。他们的发言有力地说明，只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我国各民族的文学艺术才能得到蓬勃的发展。
    作家巴金以“文学要跑在时代的前头”为题作了发言。他说，作为“灵魂的工程师”的作家们，要赶上这个向前飞奔的时代，必须投身到紧张的创作劳动中去，必须不停地写，不断地炼，把大批涌现的先进事物迅速反映到作品里来，争取在文学事业中创造出惊人的奇迹。这位老作家以自己几十年的创作经历，说明了作家改造世界观、改造思想的重要意义。他说，没有正确的世界观就不能掌握新的创作方法来表现新的人、新的生活与新的道德，就认不清什么是现实生活中的主流，就会把现象和本质混在一起，甚至连新生力量和腐朽力量也区别不出来。
    作曲家李焕之就音乐创作民族化、群众化的问题作了发言。他根据自己从事音乐创作工作的体会，认为要在创作上作到民族化和群众化，首先要求音乐工作者改造自己的世界观，切切实实地向劳动人民学习，拜群众为师。
    沪剧演员丁是娥在发言中用生动的事例说明，只有在工农兵群众崇高品质的感染之下进行自我改造，才能产生热爱工农兵、表现工农兵的思想情感，创造出英雄人物的形象。她谈到1959年除夕去福建前线前沿岗哨作慰问演唱时，听到关于哨兵们在十二级台风中，紧握枪杆，坚守岗位，一个人顶不住，两个人抱起来共同和狂风搏斗的动人故事，使她深受感动，进一步体会到党教导文艺工作者投入火热斗争生活的重大意义。
    维吾尔作家祖农·哈迪尔以自己从前创作的某些作品缺乏鲜明阶级立场为例，说明一个作家和艺术家必须努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作，坚定地树立起无产阶级的世界观，长期深入到群众中去，和工人农民同劳动共生活，才能创作出劳动人民所喜爱的作品。
    广西代表郭铭在题为“一个伟大的群众文艺运动”的发言中说，歌舞剧“刘三姐”的编演成功，完全是贯彻为工农兵服务方向和百花齐放、百家争鸣、推陈出新的方针、大搞群众运动的胜利。
    湖北省搬运工人、诗人黄声孝用豪迈的诗句开始了他的发言。他说，党培养工农作者的心血“用长江轮船装不尽，大海磨墨写不完”。他回忆过去码头工人，被帝国主义者和洋买办的走狗讥笑为“命里只有八合米，走遍天下不满升”，说他要是成了器，在手板心挖四两肉给他吃。他自豪地、雄心勃勃地说：我要和成千上万的工人兄弟们在一起，给无产阶级争光荣，在我们社会主义国家里干出一番惊天动地的事业来。
    六十岁的藏戏演员札西顿珠在发言中用“疾风暴雪花枯萎、风和日暖花重开”两句话描述了西藏藏戏在1959年平叛前后的不同景象。
    明天继续进行大会发言。（附图片）
