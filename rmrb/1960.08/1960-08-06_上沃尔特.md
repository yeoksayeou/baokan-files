Column: Information

    Upper Volta is located in central West Africa, with an area of 316,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 3.4 million, about half of whom are Mossi people. The population density is relatively high among the former French West African countries. The Mossi people of Upper Volta established a kingdom here as early as the early 11th century. However, Upper Volta was invaded by France in 1896 and became a French colony in 1909. Upper Volta was once connected with Upper Senegal and Niger, but in 1919 France separated it, forming its current boundaries. In 1933, it was divided into three parts and merged into Ivory Coast, Niger, and former French Sudan. It was not restored to its current boundaries until 1948.
    Upper Volta is located in the famous Guinea grain region of West Africa, so most of the land is arable. There are no deserts within the country, and the southwestern part has dense, oil-bearing forests. Products include corn, peanuts, cotton, palm, and so on. However, due to colonial rule, Upper Volta's economy is extremely backward, with large tracts of arable land lying fallow, and the economy is mainly based on animal husbandry. The proven gold and manganese deposits have not been well developed. The lives of the people of Upper Volta are extremely painful due to the brutal exploitation by the French colonists. It is estimated that about 150,000 people have to move abroad every year to make a living. Infectious diseases are rampant everywhere. At the beginning of this year alone, there were more than 103,000 leprosy patients, an average of one in every 35 people. In education, the national illiteracy rate is over 90%, and only 7% of school-age children are enrolled.
    In order to get rid of French colonial rule, the people of Upper Volta, together with the people of West Africa, have carried out a long-term struggle. In particular, the workers of Upper Volta have continuously held large-scale strikes in recent years. In 1958, the people of Upper Volta held demonstrations demanding complete independence. Under the strong pressure of the people of Upper Volta, the French colonists were finally forced to agree to Upper Volta's independence within the "French Community."

    上沃尔特
    上沃尔特位于西非中部，面积达三十一万六千平方公里，人口约三百四十万，其中约一半是莫西族人。人口密度在原法属西非的国家中是较大的。上沃尔特的莫西族远在十一世纪初，就在这里建立了王国。但在1896年上沃尔特遭到了法国的侵略，并于1909年沦为法国殖民地。上沃尔特曾经和上塞内加尔及尼日尔连在一起，但在1919年法国把它划了出来，形成目前的疆界。1933年曾被分成三部分合并于象牙海岸、尼日尔和前法属苏丹。到1948年才又重新恢复到目前疆界。
    上沃尔特位在西非有名的几内亚谷物区，因此绝大部分土地是可耕地。境内没有沙漠，西南部分则有茂密的含脂森林。物产有玉米、花生、棉花、棕榈等等。但是由于殖民统治，上沃尔特的经济极端落后，大片可耕地荒芜，经济以畜牧业为主。现已探明的黄金和锰矿等矿藏均未很好开发。上沃尔特人民的生活由于法国殖民者的惨重剥削而极其痛苦。据估计每年约有十五万人为了生活不得不移居到国外。传染病到处流行，仅麻疯病患者在今年初就有十万三千多人，平均每三十五人就有一个。而教育方面，全国文盲占90％以上，学龄儿童入学的只有7％。
    上沃尔特人民为了摆脱法国殖民统治，曾经同西非各国人民一起进行了长期斗争。特别是上沃尔特的工人近年来不断举行大规模的罢工斗争。1958年，上沃尔特人民又举行示威游行，要求获得完全独立。在上沃尔特人民的强大压力下，法国殖民者终于被迫同意上沃尔特在“法兰西共同体”内独立。
