Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 17th: The National Games of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, held in celebration of the 15th anniversary of the "August 15th" Liberation, solemnly concluded today in Pyongyang after eighteen consecutive days of competitions and performances since its opening on July 31st. At the closing ceremony, Vice Premier of the Cabinet of Korea, Hong Myung-hee, awarded prizes to outstanding collectives and individuals.

This sports event was unprecedented in scale in Korean history. More than five thousand athletes participated in various sports events such as ball games, track and field, parachuting, boxing, weightlifting, as well as national sports such as archery and swinging.

During the competition, athletes broke multiple national records. For example, the famous female athlete Shin Kim-dan, who recently broke the world record in the women's 800-meter race in Moscow, broke her own previous national record of 24.8 seconds in the 200-meter race with a time of 23.8 seconds this time.

On August 15th, 20,000 young students performed a large group calisthenics display called "Long Live Our Motherland" at the newly built Moranbong Stadium. Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman Choi Yong-kun, along with other party and state leaders, watched this healthy and beautiful group calisthenics performance. When the students formed a "Chollima" symbolizing the current Korean people's galloping progress, thunderous applause erupted throughout the stadium.

The relay long-distance run, which started before "August 15th" with 35,000 athletes participating, also reached its finish line precisely on August 15th. The athletes started from six locations, including Pochonbo, 1211 Heights, Panmunjom, and Sinuiju, relaying letters to Premier Kim Il-sung. Just as the large group calisthenics display was about to be held at Moranbong Stadium, teams of athletes presented the letters to Premier Kim Il-sung, expressing the people's respect and love for their leader.

    朝鲜举行全国体育大会
    五千选手参加比赛　刷新多项全国纪录
    新华社平壤17日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为庆祝“八·一五”解放十五周年而举行的全国体育大会，自7月31日开幕以来，在连续举行了十八天的比赛和表演后，今天在平壤隆重闭幕。在闭幕仪式上，朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹给成绩优秀的集体和个人发了奖。
    这次体育大会的规模在朝鲜的历史上是空前的。有五千多名选手进行了各种球类、田径、跳伞、拳击、举重等体育项目和射箭、秋千等民族体育项目的比赛。
    在比赛中，选手们刷新了多项全国纪录。如不久前在莫斯科打破了女子八百米赛跑的世界纪录的著名女选手申金丹，这一次在二百米的赛跑中以二十三秒八的成绩打破了她自己过去创造的二十四秒八的国家纪录。
    8月15日，有二万名青年学生在新建成的牡丹峰运动场表演了大团体操“我们的祖国万岁”。金日成首相和崔庸健委员长等党和国家的领导人观看了这一健康美丽的团体操表演。当学生们组成了一个象征着今天的朝鲜人民的奔驰着的“千里马”时，全场响起了雷动的掌声。
    在“八·一五”前夕开始的有三万五千名选手参加的接力长跑，也恰好在8月15日到达终点。选手们由普天堡、一二一一高地、板门店、新义州等六地出发，传递致金日成首相的信件。正当牡丹峰运动场即将举行大团体操时候，一队队的运动员把信件呈到了金日成首相的手中，表达了各地人民对领袖的尊敬和热爱。
