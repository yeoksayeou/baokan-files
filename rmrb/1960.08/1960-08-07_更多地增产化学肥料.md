    Increase the Production of Chemical Fertilizers Even More

    Vigorously increasing the production of chemical fertilizers is an important aspect of industry supporting agriculture and cities supporting rural areas. It is also an extremely important task for the working class, especially chemical industry workers, at present.

    "Whether there is a harvest or not depends on water, and how much harvest depends on fertilizer." After improving water conservancy conditions, increasing fertilizer is the key to ensuring the continuous leap forward in agricultural production. In order to fundamentally solve the fertilizer problem, we have adopted the policy of combining organic fertilizers (mainly farmyard manure) and inorganic fertilizers (chemical fertilizers). Organic fertilizers must be accumulated in large quantities, and chemical fertilizers must also be developed rapidly. At present, many places have launched a vigorous and down-to-earth manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaign, on the one hand, carrying out a crash manure accumulation drive, and on the other hand, building fertilizer bases, raising pigs on a large scale, and planting green manure crops on a large scale. However, developing organic fertilizer is one leg, and in order to guarantee increased production of grain and other cash crops year after year, the other leg must be to vigorously increase the production of chemical fertilizers and accelerate the development of the chemical fertilizer industry. This is because chemical fertilizers have high fertilizer efficiency, take effect quickly, and are convenient to transport. Producing more chemical fertilizers can promote greater increases in the production of grain and other cash crops. More grain can lead to a larger-scale development of animal husbandry, with pigs as the leader. The great development of animal husbandry can not only provide more meat, but also more and better organic fertilizers. It can be seen that combining organic and inorganic fertilizers is a policy of great significance for increasing grain production. When the broad masses of peasants are throwing themselves into the manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaign with the greatest enthusiasm, the masses of chemical industry workers should also redouble their efforts, do everything possible to increase the production of chemical fertilizers, and accelerate the development of the chemical fertilizer industry.

    To increase the production of chemical fertilizers and accelerate the development of the chemical fertilizer industry, we must start from two aspects: one is to further tap the production potential of existing fertilizer enterprises; the other is to accelerate the construction of new plants, mainly small plants with an annual output of several hundred tons of synthetic ammonia, in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    Since the beginning of this year, the situation in China's fertilizer production has been very good. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movements, the broad masses of workers have created many advanced tools and equipment, and have created some effective new processes and new methods. These achievements of the technical revolution have been preliminarily promoted in production, and the national output of fertilizers in the first half of the year has greatly increased compared with the same period last year. Some enterprises have completed 80% of their annual planned output in the first half of the year. The achievements of increased fertilizer production in the first half of the year are great, but from the perspective of agricultural needs, we must never be satisfied with this, and we must increase production even more. Now, the task placed before the workers of fertilizer factories is to continue to advance along the path of increased production opened up by the technical revolution. For new technologies and new methods that have been proven to be effective through experimentation or implementation on a small scale, especially those that can shorten the production process and save raw materials and materials, we must earnestly promote them. At the same time, we must strengthen production management and technical management according to the requirements of new technologies and new methods, and establish and implement various reasonable and necessary rules and regulations. In order to do this, the leading comrades of enterprises must go deep into the front line of production, go to the weak links in production, and eat, live, labor, and discuss with the workers, and seize and solve problems as soon as they are discovered. In this way, we can better complete and overfulfill this year's fertilizer production plan ahead of schedule.

    Among the existing fertilizer enterprises, some have just been built and put into production. They are the new force in fertilizer production. In these enterprises, the main task at present is how to quickly master the technology, pass the technical barrier, and get production on track as soon as possible to reach the designed level. Don't think that passing the technical barrier one day earlier or later is an unimportant small problem. Let's take a small fertilizer plant with an annual output of 400 tons of synthetic ammonia as an example. The synthetic ammonia it produces every day can fertilize about 270 mu of farmland, and if each mu increases grain production by an average of 100 jin, it can increase grain production by 27,000 jin. If the production of a factory reaches the designed level one day earlier, it can increase so much grain production. If there are 50 newly built factories, then it is equivalent to increasing grain production by more than 1.3 million jin every day. Isn't this a top priority? Yes. In this sense, time is grain, and fighting for time is fighting for grain. Therefore, while accelerating the construction of small fertilizer plants, we must seize the preparatory work for production, especially the training of technical forces. Those that have already been put into production must concentrate the necessary forces, break through a point, gain experience, guide the general, and pass the technical barrier well.

    China does not have many chemical fertilizer plants at present. Whether in the long run or now, to meet the needs of agricultural production for fertilizer, it is necessary to build a number of new enterprises in a planned way in batches. At present, the main task is to develop a number of small fertilizer plants with an annual output of several hundred tons of synthetic ammonia in a planned way in batches. Small plants require less investment and are built faster than large plants. It takes about two years to build a fertilizer plant with an annual output of 50,000 tons of synthetic ammonia, and it requires a lot of heavy equipment. The construction of a small fertilizer plant with an annual output of several hundred tons of synthetic ammonia can generally be put into production in only three or four months, with less investment, and a large number of non-metallic materials can be used to replace metallic materials. The required equipment is relatively simple, and general small and medium-sized machinery factories can manufacture it. Such fertilizer plants can be established not only in every county, but also in people's communes with the necessary conditions. In this way, the production of chemical fertilizers can better meet the needs of agricultural development in a relatively short period of time. In order to better support the development of agriculture, we must attach importance to the construction of small fertilizer plants. All small fertilizer plants that have been approved by the state for construction should be treated as key projects, and given strong support in all aspects, from equipment manufacturing, material allocation, and labor allocation, to promote their early start, early completion, and early role in supporting agricultural production.

    The fact that Anhui Province built eleven fertilizer plants with an annual output of 800 tons of synthetic ammonia in less than half a year (in addition, eight are installing equipment and nineteen are stepping up construction) not only proves that accelerating the construction of small fertilizer plants is entirely possible, but also provides us with useful experience. What are the main experiences provided by Anhui Province? First, party committees at all levels must take personal leadership, with secretaries taking the lead and unified command, relying on their own efforts, and organizing large-scale cooperation within the region. Compared with large-scale fertilizer plants, building small fertilizer plants is much easier, but it is still an industry with high-pressure equipment. The required equipment and materials have many varieties and high specifications. The manufacturing, installation, and production technologies are also relatively complicated. None of these can be solved by one department alone. Only under the centralized and unified leadership of the party committee can we effectively dispatch manpower and material resources from all aspects and organize large-scale cooperation throughout the province. Under the unified leadership of the Provincial Party Committee's Fertilizer Command, the mechanical departments of Anhui Province specifically ranked all production tasks, and determined that on the premise of ensuring the development of iron and steel, mines, and supporting agriculture in fighting drought and preventing floods, the task of manufacturing fertilizer equipment should be guaranteed first. In Anhui, more than 60 machinery factories participated in the task of manufacturing the main equipment for fertilizer plants. Second, under the unified and centralized leadership of the Party Committee, adopt the method of shortening the front, concentrating forces, and fighting annihilation battles, and build in batches and phases. Build a batch and then build another batch. At the beginning, in order to break the superstitious thinking of some people about building fertilizer plants, Anhui Province adopted the method of breaking through a point, establishing models at all levels, and driving the overall situation, first concentrating all its efforts to build a model plant in the province. After gaining experience in the four barriers of design, equipment manufacturing, installation and construction, and production, it immediately set up points in each prefecture and helped each prefecture quickly build a model plant. In this way, gaining experience at all levels effectively broke the superstition, strengthened the confidence in taking the road of self-reliance, and accelerated the construction speed.

    Since the Great Leap Forward, the iron and steel and machinery industries in various places have had a certain foundation, and the material and technical conditions for supporting agriculture have been greatly improved. The fertilizer industry directly serves agriculture, and small fertilizer plants are built in various prefectures, counties, and people's communes, which will surely win the support of the broad masses of peasants. We should make full use of these favorable conditions to develop small-scale fertilizer plants with indigenous methods in a planned and step-by-step manner, so that the fertilizer industry can play a greater role in supporting the development of agriculture.

    更多地增产化学肥料
    大力增产化学肥料，是工业支援农业、城市支援农村的一个重要方面，也是工人阶级，特别是化学工业职工当前的一项极其重要的任务。
      “有收无收在于水，收多收少在于肥。”水利条件改善之后，增加肥料，是保证农业生产持续跃进的关键。为了根本解决肥料问题，我们采取了有机肥料（主要是农家肥料）和无机肥料（化学肥料）并举的方针。有机肥料要大量积造，化学肥料也要加速发展。目前，许多地方已经开展了一个轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实的积肥造肥运动，一方面突击积肥，一方面建设肥料基地，大养其猪，大种绿肥。但是，发展有机肥料是一条腿，为了保证粮食和其它经济作物年年增产，另一条腿就是必须大力增产化学肥料，加速发展化学肥料工业。这是因为化学肥料的肥效高，见效快，运输方便，多生产一些化学肥料，就能促进粮食和其他经济作物的更大增产。粮食多了，可以更大规模地发展以猪为首的畜牧业。畜牧业大发展了，既可以得到更多的肉食，又可以得到更多更好的有机肥料。可见有机肥料和无机肥料并举，是一个对增产粮食具有重大意义的方针。当农民群众正以最大的干劲投入积肥造肥运动的时候，化学工业的职工群众，也应当加倍努力，千方百计地增产化学肥料，加速发展化学肥料工业。
    增产化学肥料、加速化学肥料工业的发展，要从两个方面入手：一个是进一步挖掘现有化肥企业的生产潜力；另一个是有计划、有步骤地加速以年产几百吨合成氨的小型厂为主的新厂建设工作。
    今年以来，我国化肥生产的形势是很好的。广大职工群众在技术革新、技术革命运动中，创造了很多先进的工具和设备，创造了一些行之有效的新工艺和新方法。在生产中初步推广了这些技术革命成果，上半年全国化肥的产量，比去年同期有很大增长。有的企业在上半年已完成了全年计划产量的80％。上半年化肥增产的成绩很大，但是从农业的需要来说，绝不能以此为满足，还必须更多地增产。现在，摆在化肥工厂职工面前的任务，就是继续沿着技术革命所开辟的增产途径前进。对于经过试验或在小范围内实行证明确实有效的新技术、新方法，特别是那些能够缩短生产流程和节约原料、材料的新技术、新方法，一定要切切实实地加以推广。同时，要根据新技术、新方法的要求，加强生产管理和技术管理，建立和贯彻执行各种合理的、必要的规章制度。为了做到这一点，企业的领导同志，一定要深入生产第一线，到生产中薄弱的环节上去，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，发现问题就抓住解决。这样，就可以更好地提前完成和超额完成今年的化肥生产计划。
    在现有的化肥企业中，有一些是刚刚建成投入生产的。它们是化肥生产的生力军。在这些企业里，当前的主要任务是怎样迅速掌握技术，过技术关，使生产尽早走上轨道，达到设计水平。不要以为早一天晚一天过技术关是个无关紧要的小问题。让我们拿一个年产四百吨合成氨的小化肥厂来说吧。它每天生产的合成氨可以肥田二百七十亩左右，每亩按照平均增产粮食一百斤计算，就可以增产粮食二万七千斤。一个工厂的生产每提早一天达到设计水平，就可以增产这么多粮食，如果有五十个新建成的工厂，那么就等于每天可以增产一百三十多万斤粮食。这不是头等重要的大事情吗？是的。从这个意义上讲，时间就是粮食，争时间就是争粮食。所以，在加快小型化肥工厂建设速度的同时，一定要抓紧生产的准备工作，特别是抓紧培养技术力量。现在已经投入生产的，则要集中必要的力量，突破一点，取得经验，指导一般，过好技术关。
    我国现有的化学肥料厂还不多，无论从长远或者现在看，要满足农业生产对化肥的需要，必须有计划地分期分批地兴建若干新企业。在当前，主要是有计划地分期分批地发展一批年产几百吨合成氨的小化肥厂。小厂比大厂投资少，建设快。建设一座年产五万吨合成氨的化肥厂，要两年左右时间，而且所需要的重型设备很多。而建设一座年产几百吨合成氨的小化肥厂，一般只要三、四个月便可投入生产，投资又小，又可以用大量的非金属材料代替金属材料，所需设备比较简单，一般中小型的机械厂都可以制造。这样的化肥厂，不但每个县都可以兴办，有条件的人民公社也可以兴办。这样，就能够在比较短的时间内，使化学肥料的生产更好地满足农业发展的需要。为了更好地支援农业的发展，我们必须重视小型化肥厂的建设工作。凡是已经国家批准建设的小型化肥厂，都应当作为重点工程对待，从设备制造、材料调拨、劳动力分配等各个方面，予以大力支援，以促进它们早日上马，早日建成，早日发挥支援农业生产的作用。
    安徽省在不到半年的时间内建成了十一个年产八百吨合成氨的化肥厂（另外还有八个正在安装设备，十九个正在加紧建设）的事实，不仅证明了加速小型化肥厂的建设是完全可能的，而且给我们提供了有益的经验。安徽省提供了些什么主要的经验呢？第一，就是各级党委要亲自领导，书记挂帅，统一指挥，自力更生，又在地区范围内组织大协作。比起大型的化肥厂来，建设小型化肥厂虽然容易得多，但它毕竟是一种具有高压设备的工业，需要的设备材料品种多，规格要求高，制造、安装和生产的技术也比较复杂，所有这些都不是一个部门所能单独解决的。只有在党委集中统一领导下，才能有效地调度各方面的人力物力，组织全省的大协作。安徽全省机械部门，在省委化肥指挥部统一领导下，对全部生产任务进行了具体排队，确定在确保钢铁、矿山发展和支援农业抗旱防涝需要的原则下，首先保证化肥设备的制造任务。在安徽，就有六十多个机械厂参加了化肥厂主要设备制造的任务。第二，在党委的统一集中领导下，采取缩短战线，集中力量，打歼灭战的方法，分批分期建设。建了一批再建一批。安徽省在开始的时候，为了破除有些人对建设化肥厂的迷信思想，采取突破一点，层层建立样板，以带动全面的办法，首先在全省集中全力搞好了一个样板厂，取得了设计、设备制造、安装和施工、生产四个关口的经验以后，立即在各专区布点，帮助各专区迅速建起一个样板厂来。这样层层取得经验，就有效地打破了迷信，坚定了走自力更生道路的信心，加快了建设速度。
    大跃进以来，各地的钢铁、机械工业，都已经有了一定的基础，支援农业的物质技术条件大大改善了。化肥工业是直接为农业服务的，小型化肥厂又是分散建设在各个专区、县和人民公社，它必将获得广大农民的拥护和支持。我们应该充分利用这些有利条件，有计划有步骤地发展化肥小洋群，使化肥工业在支援农业的发展中起更大的作用。
