Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 17th: Indonesian President Sukarno, speaking at a rally today celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of Indonesian independence, announced that Indonesia has severed diplomatic relations with the Netherlands. President Sukarno said: Indonesia will use all of its national strength to recover West Irian.

He also announced that he had ordered the dissolution of the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party a few days ago.

Speaking on the issue of recovering West Irian, President Sukarno said: "We (Indonesia) will never again beg to negotiate with the Dutch." Indonesia will continue to pursue this policy until West Irian is back under Indonesian sovereignty.

Sukarno said that for many years, Indonesia had pursued a policy of appealing, requesting, cooperating, and other methods to persuade the Dutch to hand over West Irian to Indonesia. However, all these attempts to implement a "soft-spoken persuasion" policy have been fruitless. He said that it is impossible to reach any understanding with the Dutch on the basis of "mutual concession." Indonesia should have realized that it must take "another path" in its efforts to recover West Irian. He said that the Indonesian people have finally abandoned its policy of "soft-spoken persuasion" and adopted a policy of using all national strength to deal with the Dutch on the West Irian issue.

Sukarno said that Indonesia pursues an active and independent foreign policy.

When announcing the order to dissolve the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party, Sukarno said that these two parties are counter-revolutionary parties, and they threaten the security and progress of the Indonesian revolution. If these two parties have not dissolved one month after the announcement of this order, then they will become banned parties.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 17th: Indonesia celebrated its fifteenth anniversary of independence today. A traditional celebration ceremony was held in front of the Presidential Palace in Jakarta this morning.

President Sukarno delivered a speech at the ceremony. In his speech, he elaborated on Indonesia's domestic and foreign policies and guidelines.

After Sukarno's speech, Minister of Construction Haroel Saleh read out the 1945 Declaration of Independence. Then the first red and white national flag that was raised when Indonesia declared its independence fifteen years ago was raised.

Then, people marched in formation across the square in front of the Presidential Palace, receiving President Sukarno's review.

    苏加诺在庆祝独立大会上宣布
    决心全力收复西伊里安
    已同荷兰绝交并下令解散马斯友美党和印度尼西亚社会党
    新华社雅加达17日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺今天在庆祝印度尼西亚独立十五周年的集会上发表演说时宣布，印度尼西亚已经同荷兰断绝了外交关系。苏加诺总统说：印度尼西亚将用它的全部民族力量来收复西伊里安。
    他还宣布，已经在几天前下令解散马斯友美党和印度尼西亚社会党。
    苏加诺总统在谈到收复西伊里安的问题时说：“我们（印度尼西亚）决不会再乞求同荷兰人谈判。”印度尼西亚将继续执行这一政策，直到西伊里安重新处于印度尼西亚主权之下为止。
    苏加诺说，许多年来，印度尼西亚奉行着一种呼吁、请求、合作和其他方法说服荷兰人把西伊里安交给印度尼西亚的政策。但是，这一切执行“婉言说服”政策的尝试都毫无结果。他说，同荷兰人是无法在“互让”的基础上求得任何谅解的。印度尼西亚已经应该认识到，它在争取收复西伊里安的努力中必须采取“另一条道路”。他说，印度尼西亚人终于放弃了它的“婉言说服”的政策，采取了在西伊里安问题上用一切民族力量来对付荷兰人的政策。
    苏加诺说，印度尼西亚奉行积极的和独立的外交政策。
    苏加诺在宣布解散马斯友美党和印度尼西亚社会党的命令的时候说，这两个党是反革命的政党，它们威胁印度尼西亚革命的安全和进展。如果这项命令宣布一个月之后，这两个党还没有解散，那么它们将成为被禁止的党。
    新华社雅加达17日电　印度尼西亚今天庆祝独立十五周年，上午在雅加达总统府前举行了传统的庆祝仪式。
    苏加诺总统在仪式上发表了讲话。他在讲话中阐述了印度尼西亚的对内、对外政策和方针。
    在苏加诺讲话后，建设部长哈鲁尔·萨勒宣读了1945年独立宣言。接着升起了十五年前印度尼西亚宣布独立时所升起的第一幅红白两色的国旗。
    然后，人们列队走过总统府前的广场，接受苏加诺总统的检阅。
