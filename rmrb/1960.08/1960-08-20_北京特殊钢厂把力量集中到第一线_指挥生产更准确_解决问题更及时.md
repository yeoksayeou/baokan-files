    Beijing Special Steel Plant Concentrates Strength on the Front Lines
    More Accurate Production Command
    More Timely Problem Solving
    (Our dispatch) The Beijing Special Steel Plant is vigorously strengthening its front lines of production. More than one-third of the factory's management cadres, a total of 115 people, have gone down to participate in production labor. More than 30 workers who were detached from production to do management work have all returned to their production posts. In addition, 12 leading cadres at various levels have been assigned downwards to strengthen the grassroots. With the strengthening of the front lines, the steel output of this steel plant is rising daily.
    On the afternoon of the 18th, more than 70 cadres from this factory, wearing work clothes and rattan hats, excitedly walked into various workshops. The workers enthusiastically taught the cadres technical skills. Prior to this, the first batch of more than 40 cadres who went down had already been working with the workers for more than ten days. They formed a "slag mountain assault team" of more than 200 people and cleared more than 2,000 tons of scrap steel and scrap iron from the slag heaps. Everyone was full of energy. Some were swinging sledgehammers to break up large pieces of steel slag, while others were operating levers or large cranes to transport the old steel out. Here, it was impossible to tell who was a worker and who was a cadre who had been sent down.
    Among the leading cadres who were assigned downwards at all levels, Liu Qiguang, deputy secretary of the Party committee, and Tan Zhizhong, deputy director of the factory, went to the steelmaking workshop to serve as the general branch secretary and the workshop director, respectively. Some workshop directors became team leaders or foremen; some team leaders and foremen went down to become furnace chiefs.
    Cadres leaving their offices and going to the front lines of production has first and foremost given a great boost to all the workers in the factory. They saw that the factory's Party committee was so determined to improve its work and that so many people were going down to the front lines of production to participate in labor. After the leading cadres came down, they solved problems promptly, and everyone was even more energetic and enthusiastic. They put forward a large number of suggestions for solving the key to increasing production and actively launched a "hundred red flags" competition. The steelmaking workshop has now planted 92 red flags, more than half of which were planted in the last few days. After the leading cadres were assigned downwards, command of production became more accurate, and problem solving became more timely. Liu Qiguang, the deputy secretary of the Party committee who went to the steelmaking workshop to serve as the general branch secretary, discovered in conversations with workers that the shortage of brick presses and air hammers had affected production. He immediately organized maintenance workers to repair four brick presses and one iron hammer overnight, meeting the needs of production. Some cadres who were not assigned downwards also went deep into the front lines of production. After factory director Qi Guang went to the Raymond mill room, one of the important links in production, the workers reported to him that the door of the machine room was not opened properly, which caused inconvenience for internal transportation. After Qi Guang and others conducted an on-the-spot inspection, they immediately started to change the door.
    This factory has achieved immediate results after drastically strengthening the front lines of production. According to statistics from the four days of the 13th to the 16th, the average daily steel output increased by 46% compared with the average daily output in the first ten days of this month. All the workers and staff are now riding the wind and waves, continuing to move forward. (Attached picture)

### 北京特殊钢厂把力量集中到第一线  指挥生产更准确  解决问题更及时

    北京特殊钢厂把力量集中到第一线
    指挥生产更准确
    解决问题更及时
    本报讯　北京特殊钢厂大力加强生产第一线，全厂有三分之一以上的管理干部一百一十五人下放参加生产劳动，三十多名脱产做管理工作的工人，也全部回到生产岗位，另外有十二名领导干部层层下放，加强基层。随着第一线的加强，这个钢厂的钢产量正逐日上升。
    18日下午，这个厂有七十多名干部，换上工作服，戴上藤柳帽，兴高采烈地走进各车间，工人们热情地把技术教给干部。在这以前，第一批下放的四十多名干部已经和工人们在一起干了十多天的活，他们和工人组成一支二百多人的“攻碴山队”，从炉碴堆中，清理出二千多吨废钢、废铁。他们个个干劲冲天，有的抡着大锤，敲打大块钢碴，有的操纵杠杆或大吊车，把旧钢铁运出来。这里，分不出谁是工人，谁是下放的干部。
    在层层下放的领导干部中，党委副书记刘奇光、副厂长谭致中，分别到炼钢车间当总支书记和车间主任；有的车间主任则当工段长或工长；有的工段长、工长则下去当炉长。
    干部走出办公室到生产第一线，首先给全厂工人以很大鼓舞。他们看到工厂党委会改进工作的决心这样大，下到生产第一线参加劳动的人这么多，领导干部下来后又及时解决问题，大家干劲更足，热情更高。他们一面提出大批解决增产关键的意见，一面积极开展百面红旗竞赛运动。炼钢车间现在已经插上了九十二面红旗，其中半数以上红旗是最近几天插上去的。领导干部下放后，指挥生产更准确，解决问题也更及时了。到炼钢车间当总支书记的党委副书记刘奇光在和工人交谈中，发现由于压砖机和风锤不足，已经影响生产，就马上组织机修工人连夜修复了四台压砖机和一台铁锤，满足了生产需要。一些没有下放的干部，也深入到生产第一线，厂长祁光到生产重要环节之一的雷蒙机房后，工人向他反映：机房的门开得不合适，给内部运输造成了不便。祁光等经过实地察看后，就立即动手把门改过来。
    这个厂大刀阔斧地加强了生产第一线后，已收到立竿见影的效果，据13日到16日四天统计，钢的平均日产量比这个月的上旬平均日产量提高了46％。全厂职工现正乘风破浪，继续前进。（附图片）
