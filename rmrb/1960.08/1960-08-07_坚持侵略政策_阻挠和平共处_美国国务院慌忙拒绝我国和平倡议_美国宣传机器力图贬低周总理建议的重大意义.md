Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The proposal made by Premier Zhou Enlai on the 1st at the National Day reception of the Swiss Embassy in China, suggesting that countries in Asia and the Pacific Rim, including the United States, sign a treaty of non-aggression and turn the entire region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone, has greatly alarmed the US government and the American bourgeois propaganda machine, which adhere to the policies of war and aggression. They have risen up in droves to denigrate and slander this proposal, attempting to belittle its great significance.

Immediately after Premier Zhou's proposal was released, White, the U.S. State Department's press officer, issued a statement on the same day on behalf of the State Department, exclaiming that China's peace initiative was a so-called "trap" and slandering it as "another meaningless propaganda gesture."

The State Department statement also falsely accused China of being "extremely belligerent" and carrying out so-called "aggression" in the Taiwan Strait. The statement distorted the facts, confused right and wrong, and portrayed China's insistence on resolutely opposing American aggression and liberating China's territory of Taiwan—a matter entirely within China's internal affairs—as incompatible with China's peace initiative. The statement also insisted on interfering in China's internal affairs, demanding that China "renounce the use of force in the Taiwan Strait area" in order to allow the United States to occupy China's territory of Taiwan for a long time and further invade the Chinese mainland.

The U.S. State Department's reaction to China's proposal was so rapid that even the United Press International, the largest bourgeois news agency in the United States, wrote in a dispatch on the 2nd: "The reaction was so quick that it actually preceded the Xinhua News Agency report." It admitted that the American reaction "almost immediately rejected" China's peace proposal because the United States was afraid that "the proposal made by the Chinese Premier would certainly receive... great attention."

The United States Information Agency, the official propaganda organ of the United States, also openly stated on the 3rd, in commenting on Premier Zhou's proposal, that it was a "futile proposal that was bound to be rejected," and clamored for "vigilance" against China's diplomatic actions.

The "New York Times" in an editorial on the 3rd, groundlessly nonsensed that Premier Zhou's proposal was a "specious and meaningless" "propaganda gesture." This newspaper indicated that the United States had no intention of abandoning its aggressive policy. It falsely accused the "purpose" of China's peace initiative as being to make the so-called "free countries carry out unilateral disarmament that would deprive them of their nuclear defenses and open the floodgates for new adventures by the numerous armies of Communist China."

    坚持侵略政策  阻挠和平共处
    美国国务院慌忙拒绝我国和平倡议
    美国宣传机器力图贬低周总理建议的重大意义
    新华社6日讯　周恩来总理1日在瑞士驻华大使馆国庆招待会上提出的亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内，签订互不侵犯的和平公约，把整个地区建成为没有核武器的地区的建议，使坚持奉行战争和侵略政策的美国政府和美国资产阶级宣传机器大为恐慌，它们一哄而起地诋毁和污蔑这一建议，妄图贬低它的重大意义。
    在周总理的建议刚刚发布之后，美国国务院新闻发布官怀特就在同一天代表国务院发表声明，惊呼中国的这个和平倡议是所谓“圈套”，并诬蔑说是“又一个毫无意义的宣传姿态”。
    国务院的声明还诬蔑中国“极端好战”，在台湾海峡进行所谓“侵略”。声明颠倒是非，混淆视听，把中国主张坚决反对美国侵略和解放中国领土台湾这一纯属中国内政的问题，说成是同中国的和平倡议不相容的。声明还坚持干涉中国内政，要中国“在台湾海峡地区放弃使用武力”，以便美国长期霸占中国领土台湾，并进而侵略中国大陆。
    美国国务院对中国建议的反应是如此迅速，甚至连美国最大的资产阶级通讯社合众国际社在2日的一条消息中也写道：“这个反应是如此之快，以至于它实际上是在新华社报道之前就有了”。它承认美国的反应“几乎是立即拒绝了”中国的和平建议，因为美国害怕“中国总理提出的建议肯定将受到……很大注意”。
    美国官方宣传机关美国新闻处3日在评论周总理的建议时也公然说，这是“必然会遭到拒绝的无济于事的建议”，并且叫嚷要对中国的外交行动“保持警惕”。
    “纽约时报”在3日的社论中毫无道理地胡说什么周总理的建议是一种“似是而非的和没有意义的”“宣传姿态”。这家报纸表示美国无意放弃侵略政策，它诬蔑中国的和平倡议的“目的”是使所谓“自由国家进行将剥夺它们的核防务的单方面裁军，并为共产党中国众多的军队进行新的冒险打开闸门。”
