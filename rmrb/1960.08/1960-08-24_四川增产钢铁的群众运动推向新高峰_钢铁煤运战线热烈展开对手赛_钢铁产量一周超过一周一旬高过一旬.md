Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 23rd: The workers in Sichuan Province's steel, iron, coal, and transportation sectors are carrying out an increase production and practice economy movement to guarantee increased steel production. Since August, the province's output of steel, iron, coal, and coke has increased week by week, and ten-day period by ten-day period. Comparing the average daily production level from the 15th to the 20th with that of the 1st to the 14th, steel increased by 58.1%, iron increased by 20%, coal and coke each increased by more than 15%, and the qualified rate of steel increased by about 5%.

Currently, on the steel, iron, coal, mining, and transportation fronts throughout the province, emulation drives are being widely and deeply carried out between factories, workshops, mines, furnaces, and units and individuals with roughly the same conditions. The twenty key coal mines along the railway lines have sought out opponents, exchanged challenge letters, and launched a labor competition upsurge of exceeding the day shift with the night shift, one shift exceeding another, and producing more and better coal, and more and better coke. The coal output of each mine has increased substantially, ensuring the needs of key steel enterprises. The characteristic of the competition in the transportation sector is to guarantee increased steel production through increased and faster transportation, achieving zero stockpiles of iron, coal, and coke at stations, and comprehensively realizing indicators such as safety, fuel saving, tire saving, and vehicle maintenance. Sixty-three units in Chengdu launched a large-scale collaborative competition to guarantee increased steel production, enabling the city's steel and steel materials to achieve the highest daily production record since the beginning of the year on the 15th, and then to obtain high steel production for five consecutive days. The workers in Chongqing, the key steel production area of the province, worked hard in the competition, enabling the city's daily production level of steel, iron, coal, and transportation in the first half of August to exceed July, and from the 15th to the 20th to exceed the first half of the month, with steel increasing by 24.3% and steel materials increasing by 57%.

All localities and industries throughout the province are vigorously supporting steel production. Each special district, city, and county is vying to transfer good iron, good coal, and good coke to support key steel plants. Lushan County, based on the principle of prioritizing external needs over internal needs, gives priority to the outward transfer of good iron, and has overfulfilled the outward transfer plan of pig iron every month since this year. As of now in August, the average daily iron transfer volume throughout the province has increased by about half compared with July, and the coal transfer volume has increased by more than 10%. Basic construction units are concentrating their efforts to accelerate the construction of basic construction projects such as raw materials, materials, fuels, and transportation to ensure steel production. The machinery industry is carrying out large-scale collaboration and is rushing to manufacture thirty sets of small coal kiln equipment and fifty-seven sets of iron mine equipment. While rushing to manufacture hot blast stoves, the Chongqing machinery industry recently sent more than 1,000 people to the steel plant construction sites to help with installation. Various localities have also tapped labor potential from within the industry and the urban population by means of technical innovation and technical revolution to reduce non-production personnel, etc., and in addition to supporting agricultural production, have also strengthened the front lines of coal and iron mine production.

Currently, all regions and related industries throughout the province are further investigating key issues and adding measures, mobilizing the masses to inspect, discuss, summarize, and evaluate the production of the previous period, and formulate new leap forward targets. After a detailed discussion of the production plan, all the workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company issued a proposal to the workers of the steel, iron, coal, and transportation departments throughout the province on August 20, to rapidly push the increase production and practice economy movement on the industrial front to a new peak.

    四川增产钢铁的群众运动推向新高峰
    钢铁煤运战线热烈展开对手赛
    钢铁产量一周超过一周一旬高过一旬
    新华社成都23日电　四川省钢、铁、煤、运各个战线的职工，开展增产节约运动，保证钢铁增产。8月份以来，全省钢、铁、煤、焦的产量，一周超过一周，一旬高过一旬。以15日至20日的平均日产水平与1日至14日比较，钢增长58.1％，铁增长20％，煤和焦炭各增长15％以上，钢的合格率提高了5％左右。
    现在，全省钢、铁、煤、矿、运战线，正在广泛深入地开展厂与厂、车间与车间、井与井、炉与炉以及各种条件大致相同的单位和个人之间的对手赛。铁路沿线的二十个重点煤矿，自找对手，互下战表，掀起了一个夜班超白班，一班超一班，多产好煤，多产好焦的劳动竞赛热潮。各矿的煤产量都大幅度增长，保证了重点钢铁企业的需要。交通运输部门的竞赛特点，是以多运快运保证钢铁增产，做到站无存铁存煤存焦，并且全面实现安全、节油、节约轮胎、爱护车辆等指标。成都市六十三个单位展开保证钢铁增产的协作大竞赛，使全市钢和钢材在15日创造了今年以来的最高日产纪录以后，又连续五天获得钢的高产。全省钢铁重点产地重庆市的职工，在竞赛中埋头苦干，使全市8月上半月钢、铁、煤、运的日产水平超过7月，15日到20日又超过上半月，其中钢增长24.3％，钢材增长57％。
    全省各地各行各业对于钢铁生产大力支援。各专区、市、县都争相调好铁好煤好焦支援重点钢厂。乐山县本着先外后内的原则，优先将好铁外调，今年以来月月超额完成生铁外调计划。8月份到目前为止，全省平均日调铁量比7月份增长了一半左右，调煤量增长10％以上。基本建设单位集中力量，加紧建设保证钢的生产的原料、材料、燃料、运输等基本建设工程项目。机械工业开展大协作，正在赶制三十套小煤窑设备和五十七套铁矿山设备。重庆市机械工业在赶制热风炉的同时，最近派出一千多人分赴钢厂施工现场，帮助安装。各地还通过技术革新和技术革命，减少非生产人员等办法，从工业内部和城市人口中挖掘劳动力潜力，除支援农业生产外，也加强了煤矿铁矿生产第一线。
    目前，全省各地区和各有关工业都正在进一步查关键、添措施，发动群众检查、讨论、总结、评比前一时期的生产，制订新的跃进指标。重庆钢铁公司全体职工，在详细讨论生产计划以后，8月20日向全省钢、铁、煤、运部门的职工发出倡议，迅速把工业战线上的增产节约运动推向新的高峰。
