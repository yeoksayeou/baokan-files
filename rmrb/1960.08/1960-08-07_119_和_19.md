　　119 and 19　Liu Feng
　　Among the delegates attending the Third Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers, there was Wang Weilin, an old artist who had been playing the big gong for a lifetime and was one hundred and nineteen years old, and Shen Wenhui, a nineteen-year-old young Han opera actress. These two, one old and one young, with a century of difference in age, attending the grand event at the same time, is a good story in our socialist construction.
　　Building a great socialist edifice is an arduous task that cannot be accomplished by a few people alone. The more people who participate, the better. In fact, it is precisely the case that the 650 million people in the country share the same thoughts and feelings, and all want to quickly change the "poor and blank" face left over from history. Because of this, there is a huge enthusiasm for building socialism hidden among the masses. The content of this enthusiasm is extremely rich. There is a strong revolutionary will to strive for the realization of socialism and communism, as well as loyal, vigorous, hard-working, simple, and daring excellent qualities. We must be good at discovering this enthusiasm of the masses in essence and try every means to mobilize it so that anyone can contribute a brick and a tile in the construction of the socialist edifice.
　　Old man Wang Weilin can be regarded as one of the oldest elders who contribute to socialism. He is not only the oldest representative attending the Congress of Literary and Art Workers, but also a rare one in the whole country. Of course, there are more than just nineteen-year-old actors, and there are naturally younger ones. We will also remember that there were young representatives attending the National Congress of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education. Zhu Weiqing, the vice president of the Young Pioneer Hospital of Jizhai Primary School in Mian County, Shaanxi Province, was only eleven years old. In life, there are also people who participate in labor at an even younger age than these people. Of course, this is not considered formal participation in production labor, but a new flower of the combination of education and production labor. During the Great Leap Forward two years ago, there were children who smelted iron and steel; in the countryside, children engaged in high-yield experimental fields were even more ubiquitous. The old and the young, all forces are mobilized to contribute their strength to the construction of socialism. This is precisely the new feature of our era. It shows that the power of our socialist construction is unprecedentedly strong.
　　Now, all kinds of forces in our country serving the socialist cause have been mobilized. After the establishment of urban people's communes, the vast number of women have been more thoroughly liberated and plunged into the cause of socialist construction. In our country's rich and vast land, everyone can give full play to their strengths and show their talents. In our country's socialist garden, spring, summer, autumn and winter all year round, socialist flowers are competing for beauty and blooming vigorously. The old and the young, men and women, people from all walks of life, are joining the ranks of building socialism in groups. Our team is expanding, and our strength is growing stronger. It is precisely because we have taken the mass line that the pace of construction has been accelerated. Under the sunshine of the general line, in the sound of the horn of the Great Leap Forward, all positive factors for building socialism have been mobilized, and people's activity space has also become infinitely broad. Everyone contributes ideas and efforts, and people work together with one heart and one mind, and hundreds of millions of people are united as one, twisted into a rope, which truly presents a beautiful picture of the sea wide enough for fish to leap and the sky high enough for birds to fly. Wang Weilin and Shen Wenhui, one old and one young with a century of difference in age, are precisely a microcosm of the blooming of hundreds of flowers in our socialist garden.

    119和19	刘丰
    出席这次中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会的代表，有打了一辈子大锣的一百一十九岁的老艺人王维林，也有十九岁的汉剧青年演员沈文慧。这两位，年龄整整相差一世纪的一老一少，同时参加盛会，是我们社会主义建设中的一段佳话。
    建设伟大的社会主义大厦是一件艰巨的任务，决不是少数人所能胜任的，而是要参加的人越多越好。事实上也正是这样，全国六亿五千万人，人同此心，心同此理，都想迅速改变历史上遗留下来的“一穷二白”的面貌。正因为如此，在群众中蕴藏着巨大的建设社会主义的积极性。这种积极性的内容是极为丰富的。这里有坚强的为实现社会主义、共产主义而奋斗的革命意志，也有忠心耿耿、朝气勃勃、艰苦朴素、敢想敢干的优秀品质。我们必须善于从本质上发现群众的这种积极性，而千方百计地把它调动起来，以便使任何人都能在建设社会主义大厦中贡献一砖一瓦。
    王维林老人可算是为社会主义贡献力量最老的长者之一了。他不仅是参加文代会的代表中年龄最高的一位，就是在全国来说也是不可多得的。小的当然不止是十九岁的演员，比他小的自然还有。我们还会记得出席全国文教先进工作者代表大会的就有小代表，陕西省沔县纪宅小学红领巾医院副院长朱维庆只有十一岁。在生活中，比这些人年岁还小就参加劳动的也还有。自然，这并不算是正式参加生产劳动，而是教育与生产劳动相结合的新花。前年在大炼钢铁时，就有孩子们炼出的铁和钢；在农村中小孩搞丰产试验田的，更是到处都是，到处都有。老老少少，一切力量都调动起来为建设社会主义贡献自己的力量，这正是我们时代的新的特点。它说明了我们社会主义建设的威力是空前强大的。
    现在，我国为社会主义事业服务的各种力量都被调动起来。在城市人民公社建立之后，广大妇女更彻底地得到了解放，投到了社会主义建设事业中来。在我们祖国的丰饶、宽广的土地上，每个人都能各展所长，大显身手。在我们祖国社会主义的大花园中一年四季春夏秋冬，社会主义的百花都在争奇斗艳、欣欣向荣地盛开怒放。有老有少，老老少少，男男女女，各阶层的人，都成群结队参加到建设社会主义的队伍中来。我们的队伍越来越扩大，我们的力量也就越壮大。正是由于我们走了群众路线，建设的步子就更加快了。在总路线的阳光照耀下，在大跃进的号角声里，调动了各种建设社会主义的积极因素，人们活动的天地也无限地广阔起来，群策群力，同心同德，亿万人结成一条心，拧成一股绳，真是呈现了一片海阔任鱼跃，天高任鸟飞的美好景象。王维林和沈文慧这两位年龄整整相差一世纪的一老一少，正是我们社会主义大花园中百花盛开的一个缩影。
