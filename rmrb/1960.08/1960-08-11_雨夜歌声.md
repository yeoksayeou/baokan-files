    Rainy Night Song
    PLA soldier Zhang Lansheng
    The troops march at night,
    Bivouac in a small pine forest,
    The rain is pouring down,
    Lightning and thunder.
    The soldiers all wake up,
    Soaked to the bone,
    Suddenly hear the flute,
    Singing in the rainy night.
    Following the sound of the flute,
    A figure in the rain,
    Tall and big,
    The flute sounds truly moving.
    It turns out to be the company commander,
    His face full of smiles,
    Everyone surrounds him,
    Singing echoes around the mountains.
    Holding a party on a rainy night,
    This is truly novel;
    Singing tunes from home,
    Particularly moving to hear.
    Flute accompanies singing,
    Laughter welcomes the dawn,
    A round, red sun,
    Rises to the top of the high mountain…

    雨夜歌声
    解放军战士　张兰生
    部队夜行军，
    路宿小松林，
    大雨哗哗下，
    闪电又雷鸣。
    战士都惊醒，
    浑身湿淋淋，
    忽听笛子响，
    雨夜传歌声。
    顺着笛声望，
    雨中一人影，
    个子高又大，
    笛声真动人。
    原来是连长，
    满脸笑盈盈，
    大家围着他，
    歌声绕山岭。
    雨夜开晚会，
    这事真新颖；
    唱起家乡调，
    分外动人听。
    笛子伴歌声，
    欢笑迎黎明，
    一轮大红日，
    升上高山顶……
