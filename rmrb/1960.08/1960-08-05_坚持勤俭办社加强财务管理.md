Rural people's communes are unified organizers of production, exchange, distribution, and consumption in the countryside. They are comprehensive large enterprises encompassing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, as well as industry, commerce, and transportation. At the same time, they are grassroots units combining workers, farmers, merchants, students, and soldiers, integrating government and commune management. Each commune has thousands, even tens of thousands, of laborers and an annual income of several million to tens of millions of yuan. With such a large scale of production, such complex business projects, and such a vast estate, it is imperative to make great efforts to strengthen business management and establish a relatively sound financial management and economic accounting system. Only in this way can we ensure the full development of various production and construction undertakings of the commune and the continuous increase of income for the members, promote the consolidation and development of the people's commune, and fully operate the people's commune well.

The principle of strengthening the financial management of the commune should be: in accordance with the general guideline of "developing the economy and ensuring supply," adhere to diligence and thrift in running the commune, implement economic accounting, improve the financial system, and strengthen democratic management. That is to say, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, use economic accounting and sound systems, use the method of mobilizing all commune members to handle finances and launching mass movements, implement the policy of diligence and thrift in running the commune and democratic management, so that financial work can better serve the development of commune production and rational distribution.

Diligence and thrift in running the commune is a long-term fundamental policy. Production is the basis of all economic activities. Without production, accumulation and consumption are just empty words. While increasing production, we must practice strict economy. Economy is active, not passive. Socialist economy means being good at achieving the greatest production results with the least consumption of manpower and materials. Therefore, economy itself is an extremely important condition for developing production. Practicing strict economy is a constant task. Many of our people's communes, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, have implemented the policy of diligence and thrift in running the commune, which is an important factor in our continuous leap forward in agricultural production. However, it must also be seen that in the context of great production development, quite a few commune cadres have developed a misconception that now that production has developed and accumulation has increased, it seems that there is no need to emphasize economy so much anymore. This is not right. Although China's economy has made great leaps forward in recent years, our production level is still very low after all. The vast majority of our people's communes have not yet solved the problem of "no cattle for plowing and no oil for lighting." Solving this problem still requires a considerable period of hard work. After we solve the problems of mechanization, semi-mechanization, and a considerable degree of electrification, our production will be greatly improved, and our lives will be better and richer than they are now. But even then, we must adhere to the principle of diligence and thrift. Waste is wrong at any time and should be opposed. We attach particular importance to economy because we are laborers, and we know that all wealth is created by labor. Wasting any wealth is wasting and ruining the labor of ourselves and others. We especially value economy because we not only want to build socialism, but also communism. Party committees and people's committees at all levels must strengthen ideological education on diligence and thrift in running the commune and economic accounting for all rural cadres, and regularly conduct ideological education on the glory of economy and the shame of waste. Whether the proportion of non-productive expenditures is reduced and whether the proportion of business management expenses is reduced should be used as one of the criteria for evaluating the work of the commune. Whether they are diligent and thrifty, whether they are honest and devoted to public service, and whether they have learned to manage their households well should be used as important conditions for evaluating commune cadres. We must mobilize the masses to supervise everyone and plug all loopholes for extravagance and waste in all aspects.

Improving the financial system and strengthening economic accounting are important tools for improving the management level of the commune and adhering to the principle of diligence and thrift in running the commune. The financial system of the people's commune roughly includes four aspects: the financial planning system, the accounting system, the cash management system, and the material management system. Recently, various places are improving these systems based on the actual needs of current work, stipulating strict approval procedures, and stipulating specific methods for controlling non-productive expenditures. For example, it is stipulated that in recent years, people's communes shall not build auditoriums, office buildings, and guesthouses; shall not purchase cars and motorcycles; shall not entertain guests and give gifts and pay entertainment expenses; the total amount of management expenses of organizations at all levels of the people's commune shall be strictly controlled within the prescribed range, and can only be reduced, not exceeded; and so on. These are necessary and correct and should be resolutely implemented. Strictly controlling non-productive expenditures is one aspect of realizing diligence and thrift in running the commune. On the other hand, productive expenditures must be used rationally to achieve greater economic results with the least manpower, material resources, and financial resources. This requires the implementation of economic accounting. Economic accounting is not mysterious. Implementing economic accounting means registering, calculating, and comparing the daily production activities and other economic activities of the commune members to see which is advanced, which is backward, which is economical, and which is wasteful. Turn dead numbers into living teaching materials, mobilize the masses to learn from the advanced and economical, promote the development of increasing production and practicing economy, and achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. The economic accounting of rural people's communes should first be rapidly promoted in commune-run enterprises. Commune-run enterprises are developing rapidly and have great potential, and they have the experience of similar state-owned enterprises for reference, making it easier to promote. In terms of agricultural production, according to the characteristics of agricultural production, we must stipulate simple, easy-to-implement, and easy-to-understand methods for calculating income and expenditure, and we can also selectively pilot agricultural cost accounting in crops planted in continuous areas and large-scale high-yield fields. As long as we go from shallow to deep and gradually improve, we can make economic work more and more meticulous, and economic accounting can become a powerful weapon for promoting labor emulation, developing production, and reducing costs, and a good school for absorbing the masses to participate in management and enabling cadres and the masses to learn how to manage the economy.

To do a good job in the commune's financial management and economic accounting, we must not rely solely on a few people, but must mobilize the broad masses, implement the policy of democratic management of the commune, and combine the forces of leading cadres, financial personnel, and commune members, and combine regular democratic management with the large-scale mass "financial management" movement twice a year. The so-called regular democratic management includes the establishment of systems, the formulation of plans, the use of funds, the distribution of income and other major issues, which must be fully discussed by the masses. The commune's financial income and expenditure accounts, the commune members' work point accounts, and the canteen food accounts must be posted regularly to solicit opinions from the masses and organize mass representatives to review and supervise; each commune member's work points, investment, and advance payments must be registered in a commune member's economic manual, and the accountant must bring the account to the door or to the field for verification, so that the commune members know how much work they have done and how much money they should get, so that they are clear and have a bottom line; in the production process, frequent analysis and comparison are made between the plan and the actual situation, between this year and last year, and between this unit and that unit, and the masses are mobilized to展开讨论, thereby improving business management, labor organization and farming techniques. These are important ways to achieve economic democracy and financial openness. The so-called large-scale mass "financial management" movement twice a year is that in the two seasons of summer harvest distribution and autumn harvest distribution each year, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the masses should be mobilized to participate in verifying output, checking income and expenditure, inventorying assets, and reviewing accounts, and conduct a mass accounting, inspection, evaluation, and summary. Such a mass movement can not only provide correct data for rational distribution, but also actually conduct a comprehensive inspection of the production achievements, production experience, business management, and cadre style of the year or half year through financial inspection and income and expenditure analysis, so as to summarize experience and improve leadership. This large-scale mass "financial management" movement can expose and solve problems that are difficult to discover and solve in peacetime, and can greatly improve the level of the commune's financial management, economic accounting, and business management, which is of extremely profound significance and must be given sufficient attention.

Doing a good job in commune finances is by no means an easy task. We must strengthen Party leadership, rely on the masses, and launch a large-scale mass movement to do a good job. This requires Party committees and people's committees at all levels to strengthen commune financial management as a tool to promote commune production and adhere to diligence and thrift in running the commune, and as an important aspect of improving the relationship between cadres and the masses and rectifying the style of cadres. Therefore, Party organizations must not only strengthen regular leadership, but also plan to grasp it at least twice a year, and conduct two large-scale mass movements. Once for summer harvest distribution and once for autumn harvest distribution. Make it a system and follow it every year. At the same time, financial departments at all levels, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels and with the assistance of banking departments at all levels, should effectively improve commune finances. All localities must be determined to strive to establish a relatively scientific financial management and accounting system in all rural people's communes within two or three years, and greatly improve the management level of the people's communes.

### 坚持勤俭办社加强财务管理

    坚持勤俭办社加强财务管理
    农村人民公社是农村中生产、交换、分配和消费的统一组织者，是包括农林牧副渔各业和工业、商业、运输业在内的综合性大企业，同时又是工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的基层单位。每个公社都拥有几千个以至上万个劳动力，每年都有几百万以至上千万元的收入。这么大的生产规模，这么复杂的经营项目，这么大的家业，一定要用极大的努力，加强经营管理，建立一套比较健全的财务管理和经济核算制度，才能保证公社各项生产建设事业的充分发展和社员收入的不断增加，才能促进人民公社的巩固和发展，才能把人民公社完全办好。
    加强公社的财务管理工作的原则应当是：按照“发展经济，保障供给”的总方针，坚持勤俭办社，实行经济核算，健全财务制度，加强民主管理。就是说，在党委统一领导下，用经济核算和健全制度的办法，用发动全体社员办财务，大搞群众运动的办法，贯彻执行勤俭办社和民主办社的方针，使财务工作更好地为发展公社生产和合理进行分配服务。
    勤俭办社是一条长远的根本方针。生产是一切经济活动的基础。离开生产，积累和消费都不过是一句空话。在增加生产的同时，必须厉行节约。节约是积极的，不是消极的。社会主义的节约，就是要善于用最少的人力物力消耗，取得最大的生产成果。所以节约本身就是发展生产的一个极为重要的条件。厉行节约，这是经常的任务。我们的许多人民公社在各级党委的领导下，是执行了勤俭办社这个方针的，这是我们取得农业生产持续跃进的一个重要因素。但是也要看到，在生产大发展的情况下，确有不少公社干部产生了一种错觉，以为现在生产发展了，积累增多了，似乎不需要再那么强调节约了。这是不对的。最近几年，虽然我国的经济有了巨大的跃进，但是我们的生产水平毕竟还是很低的。我们的绝大部分人民公社还没有解决“耕地不用牛，点灯不用油”的问题。解决这个问题还需要相当长时期的艰苦努力。我们解决了机械化、半机械化和相当程度的电气化的问题以后，我们的生产会有更大的提高，我们的生活也会比现在更好、更富裕，但是即使到了那时候，我们还要坚持勤俭的原则，浪费在任何时候都是不对的，都是应该反对的。我们所以特别重视节约是因为我们是劳动者，我们知道一切财富都是劳动创造的，浪费任何财富就是浪费和糟踏自己和别人的劳动，我们所以特别珍贵节约，更因为我们不但要建设社会主义，还要建设共产主义。各级党委和各级人民委员会，要对一切农村干部加强勤俭办社、经济核算的思想教育，经常地进行节约光荣、浪费可耻的思想教育。要把是否降低非生产性开支所占的比重，是否降低经营管理费用所占的比重，作为评定公社工作的标准之一；要把是否勤俭节约，是否廉洁奉公，是否学会当家过日子，作为评定公社干部的重要条件；要发动群众人人监督，从各方面堵塞一切铺张浪费的漏洞。
    健全财务制度，加强经济核算，是提高公社经营管理水平，坚持勤俭办社的重要工具。人民公社的财务制度，大体包括四个方面，即：财务计划制度，会计制度，现金管理制度，物资管理制度。最近各地根据当前实际的工作需要，正在健全这方面的制度，规定严格的审批手续，并且规定控制非生产性开支的具体办法。比如，规定最近几年内人民公社一律不兴建礼堂、办公楼和招待所；一律不购置小汽车、摩托车；一律不请客送礼和开支招待费用；人民公社各级组织管理费用的总数严格控制在规定的幅度以内，只能减少，不能超过；等等。这些都是必要的、正确的，应当坚决贯彻执行。严格控制非生产性开支，是实现勤俭办社的一个方面，在另一方面还要合理地使用生产性开支，以最少的人力、物力、财力，取得更大的经济成果，这就必须实行经济核算。经济核算并不神秘。实行经济核算，就是把社员群众的日常生产活动和其他经济活动，进行登记、计算、比较，看看哪个先进，哪个落后，哪个节约，哪个浪费，把死数字变成活教材，发动群众向先进的、节约的看齐，促进增产节约的开展，作到多快好省。农村人民公社的经济核算，首先要在社办企业中迅速推行。社办企业发展快，潜力大，又有同类国营企业的经验可供参考，比较容易推行。在农业生产方面，要按照农业生产的特点，规定简便易行浅显易懂的收支核算办法，还可以有重点地逐步在连片种植的农作物和大面积丰产方中试行农业成本核算。只要由浅入深，逐步提高，就可以使经济工作愈作愈细致，就可以使经济核算成为推动劳动竞赛、发展生产、降低成本的有力武器，成为吸收群众参加管理、使干部和群众学会管理经济的一所好学校。
    要搞好公社财务管理和经济核算，决不能仅仅依靠少数人员，必须发动广大群众，实行民主办社的方针，把领导干部、财务人员和社员群众三方面的力量结合起来，把经常的民主管理同一年两次的大规模的群众“理财”运动结合起来。所谓经常的民主管理，包括制度的建立，计划的制定，资金的使用，收益的分配等等重大问题，都要经过群众的充分讨论。公社的财务收支账，社员工分账，食堂伙食账，都要按期张榜公布，征求群众意见，组织群众代表审查监督；每个社员的工分、投资、预支，都要建立社员经济手册加以登记，由会计带账上门或到田间进行核对，使社员知道自己作了多少工，应得多少钱，清楚明白，心中有底；在生产过程中经常地在计划与实际之间、今年与去年之间、这个单位与那个单位之间进行分析比较，发动群众展开讨论，借此改善经营管理、劳动组织和耕作技术。这些都是实现经济民主财务公开的重要方式。所谓一年两次大规模的群众“理财”运动，就是在每年的夏收分配和秋收分配两个季节，都应当在党委统一领导下，发动群众参加核实产量、查对收支、盘点资产、审查账目等项工作，进行一次群众性的大算账，大检查，大评比，大总结。这样的群众运动，不仅能够为合理进行分配提供正确的资料，而且实际上是通过财务的检查和收支分析，对一年或半年的生产成绩、生产经验、经营管理、干部作风进行一次全面的检查，借以总结经验，改进领导。这种大规模的群众性“理财”运动可以暴露和解决平时难以发现、难以解决的问题，可以大大提高公社财务管理、经济核算和经营管理的水平，具有极为深刻的意义，必须予以足够的重视。
    搞好公社财务决不是一件轻而易举的事。必须加强党的领导，依靠群众，大搞群众运动，才能办好。这就需要各级党委、各级人民委员会把加强公社财务管理作为推动公社生产，坚持勤俭办社的一种工具，作为改善干部和群众的关系、整顿干部作风的一个重要方面，因此，党的组织既要加强经常的领导，又要有计划地每年至少大抓两次，搞两次大规模的群众运动。夏收分配一次，秋收分配一次。定为制度，年年照办。同时各级财政部门要在各级党委的领导下，在各级银行部门的协助下切实把公社财务搞好。各地要下定决心争取在两三年内在所有农村人民公社，建立起一套比较科学的财务管理和核算制度，大大提高人民公社的经营管理水平。
