Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang: Guizhou Province is actively organizing a transportation "dragon" centered on small steel plants to ensure that blast furnaces are well-fed. The province's major steel bases have now organized "dragon" transport with more than ten raw material and fuel bases.

Guizhou Province organizes the transportation "dragon" centered on small steel plants. The specific approach is to have leading cadres from factories, mines, and transportation departments form a transportation "dragon" office to uniformly formulate transportation plans. Taking steel plants as the base point, they adopt the method of fixed vehicles, fixed routes, fixed points, and fixed tasks to specifically assign professional vehicles to factories and mines. On the one hand, this ensures the transport of raw materials and fuels needed by the steel base, and on the other hand, it ensures the transport of products. For mountain trails leading to mines and coal pits, they adopt the method of "small dragons protecting big dragons, big dragons embracing small dragons," organizing ox carts and horse carts that match the capacity of the automobiles to participate in transportation, so that the steel base and raw material and fuel bases are connected in one line, with ox carts, horse carts, automobiles, and trains interlocking. In order to accurately grasp the source of goods and arrange transportation capacity, the transportation department also dispatches resident personnel to key factories and mines to grasp the production and storage of coking coal and ore in key factories and mines, and to contact and arrange transportation in a timely manner. This avoids the past phenomenon of having transportation capacity but no source of goods, or having a source of goods but insufficient transportation capacity arrangement, due to poor coordination between production departments and transportation departments.

After Guizhou Province realized the transportation "dragon" centered on small steel plants, the freight volume increased greatly, further promoting the development of steel production. In June alone, the transportation volume of coke increased by 75.6% compared with May; the province's main steel raw materials and fuels were basically transported as they were produced. After the Lindong Coal Mine in Guiyang City was included in the transportation "dragon," it changed the past situation where raw coal was piled up in the mine while some factories and mines were short of coal. Due to the reliable guarantee of ore and coke, the average daily output of Lushan Iron Plant in June increased by 33.32% compared with May, and the quality of pig iron also improved significantly.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 31st: The vast number of workers on the Chongqing transportation front have launched a large-scale transportation competition to protect steel, stepping up the rush to transport coal, coke, pig iron, and ore to ensure that steelmaking furnaces are well-fed.

Since the launch of the steel protection competition in various transportation units in July, the daily transportation volume of coal, coke, ore, pig iron, and limestone has been rising steadily. Compared with the first ten days of July, the coal transportation volume of railway transportation and water transportation in the city increased by 6.4%, iron ore increased by 11%, and limestone increased by 13%. In the steel protection competition, various transportation departments have solidly grasped the dispatch and on-site command work. Chongqing Water Transportation Company, in response to the key problem of slow fleet formation in the past, which affected the sailing of ships, strengthened the on-site dispatch work, pre-arranged the fleet, and accelerated the turnaround time of ships; at the same time, it added eighty-six barges to transport steel protection materials. Railway workers at the Chongqing Office of the Chengdu Railway Bureau fixed a certain number of train cars to load coal and coke between the Wansheng Station, which loads a large amount of coal, and the Jiulongpo Station, which unloads coal, so that more than 40% of raw coal and coke were loaded and unloaded in whole trains, directly transported, greatly improving transportation efficiency. Leading cadres of this railway office also went deep into a group of stations with large loading and unloading volumes to vigorously organize and strengthen loading and unloading forces to shorten loading and unloading time. At present, all stations have achieved immediate transportation of coal, with no coal stored at the stations.

Chongqing's transportation departments have also vigorously promoted the mechanization of loading and unloading, and cooperated with various factories and mines to jointly organize the source of goods, allocate transportation capacity, and rush loading and unloading.

This newspaper reports: The 20,000 employees of Beijing Transportation Company are fighting the rainy season and high temperatures to rush the materials needed for steel production.

July is Beijing's rainy season. In order to ensure the unimpeded passage of key materials such as steel, pig iron, and ore, the company transferred more than 1,000 trucks for transportation and launched a mass movement to fight the rainy season and seize high yields. Since the beginning of July, many automobile yards have hung banners and slogans such as "Every second counts, not an ounce is given up" and "Work hard in light rain, work especially hard in heavy rain" to express their determination to accelerate the transportation of "steel supplies". Drivers worked day and night shifts to rush the transportation of key materials. On many highways, people can often see truck trains with several trailers, fully loaded with raw materials for steel production such as coal, pig iron, and dolomite, heading to various steel factories in the city. According to the statistics of Beijing Transportation Headquarters, the steel production materials transported by transportation workers in the first and middle ten days of July were more than 1,300 tons per day more than in June on average.

In the vigorous competition movement, drivers and stevedores tenaciously overcame various difficulties and accelerated vehicle turnaround. In the first and middle ten days of July, Beijing had seven days of heavy rain, and all transportation stations achieved uninterrupted vehicle transportation and uninterrupted loading. Many stevedores wore rain gear to load and unload goods in the heavy rain, and even though the leaders repeatedly advised them, they refused to go indoors to rest. The drivers of the first and third teams of Changxindian Automobile Yard launched a competition to rush the transportation of dolomite; when automobile parts failed on the road, they helped each other repair them, and helped each other when there were difficulties. As a result, they transported six times in one day and night in rainy weather, two times more than in sunny weather, and the transportation efficiency increased by 50%.

During rainy days, more than half of the leading cadres and office cadres of the company go to the front line of production. From the party committee secretary and manager of the company to the general branch secretary and director of the automobile yard, they all set up command posts on the spot to directly command production and earnestly solve specific problems. Maintenance workers also carried toolboxes and drove tool vehicles to the site to do vehicle maintenance and repair work. (Attached pictures)

    车船齐发　为钢铁厂赶运“粮草”
    贵州汽车马车火车环环相扣　保证原料燃料随产  重庆水陆运输保钢竞赛轰轰烈烈调度指挥扎  北京运输公司职工战胜高温雨季人不停装
    新华社贵阳电　贵州省以钢铁小洋群为中心积极组织运输一条龙，保证高炉吃饱吃好。全省主要钢铁基地目前已同十多个原料燃料基地组织了“一条龙”运输。
    贵州省以钢铁小洋群为中心组织运输一条龙，具体做法是由厂矿和运输部门抽出负责干部组成运输“一条龙”办公室，统一制定运输计划。他们以钢铁厂为基点，采取定车、定线、定点、定任务的办法，将专业车具体落实到厂矿，一方面保证钢铁基地需要原料燃料的运进，另一方面又保证产品的运出。对通往矿山和煤井的山间小道，又采取“小龙保大龙，大龙抱小龙”的办法，组织与汽车运量相适应的牛车马车参加运输，使钢铁基地和原料燃料基地一线相连，牛车马车汽车火车环环相扣。为了准确掌握货源，安排运力，运输部门还向重点厂矿派遣驻厂人员，掌握重点厂矿焦煤、矿石的生产和贮备情况，及时联系装运。这样就避免了过去由于生产部门和运输部门之间配合不好而出现的有运力无货源或有货源而运力安排不足的现象。
    贵州省实现以钢铁小洋群为中心的运输“一条龙”后，货运量大大增加，进一步促进了钢铁生产的发展。6月份仅焦炭一项，运量就比5月份增长75.6％；全省主要的钢铁原料燃料，基本上做到了随产随运。贵阳市林东煤矿纳入运输“一条龙”后，改变了过去原煤积压在矿山而有些厂矿又闹煤荒的局面。炉山铁厂由于矿石和焦炭有了可靠的保证，6月份平均日产量比5月份上升33.32％，生铁质量也有显著提高。
    据新华社重庆31日电　重庆市交通运输战线的广大职工，展开运输保钢大竞赛，加紧抢运煤焦、生铁、矿石，保证炼钢炉吃饱吃好。
    7月份各运输单位开展保钢竞赛以来，煤焦、矿石、生铁、石灰石的日运量，都节节上升，中旬和上旬比较，全市铁路运输和水上运输的煤运量上升了6.4％，铁矿石上升了11％，石灰石上升了13％。在保钢大竞赛中，各运输部门都扎扎实实地抓调度和现场指挥工作。重庆市水上运输公司，针对过去船队编组慢、影响船舶行驶的关键，加强了现场调度工作，预先将船队编好，加快了船的周转时间；同时，增加了八十六艘驳船，运输保钢物资。成都铁路局重庆办事处的铁路职工，在大量装煤的万盛车站和卸煤的九龙坡车站之间，固定了一定数量的列车车厢装煤焦，使40％以上的原煤和焦煤都实现了整列装卸，直达运输，大大提高了运输效率。这个铁路办事处的领导干部，还深入到装运量和卸车量大的一批车站，大力组织和加强装卸搬运力量，来缩短装卸时间。目前，各车站已做到有煤即运，站无存煤。
    重庆各交通运输部门还大搞装卸机械化，并同各厂矿大搞协作，共同组织货源、调配运力，抢装抢卸。
    本报讯　北京市运输公司两万名职工奋战雨季和高温，赶运钢铁生产所需的物资。
    7月是北京的雨季。这个公司为了确保钢材、生铁、矿石等重点物资通行无阻，抽调了一千多辆汽车进行运输，展开了战雨季、夺高产的群众运动。进入7月份以来，许多汽车场都悬挂着“争分夺秒，斤两不让”、“小雨大干，大雨特干”等横幅和标语，表示加速运输“钢粮”的决心。司机们昼夜轮班抢运重点物资。在许多条公路上，人们经常能看到挂着数部拖车的汽车列车，满载着煤炭、生铁、白云石等钢铁生产原料，驶向全市各个钢铁工厂。据北京市运输指挥部统计，运输工人在7月上、中旬运输的钢铁生产所需的物资，比6月份平均每天多运一千三百多吨。
    司机和装卸工人们在轰轰烈烈的竞赛运动中，顽强地战胜各种各样的困难，加速车辆周转。7月上、中旬，北京下了七天大雨，各个运输站都做到了车不停运，人不停装。许多装卸工人在大雨中穿着雨衣装卸货物，虽然领导人员一再劝告他们，他们也不肯到屋内去休息一下。长辛店汽车场一、三小队的司机们，在抢运白云石时开展对手竞赛；汽车在路途中发生机件故障，相互帮助修理，有了困难，互相帮助。结果，在雨天一昼夜运了六次，比晴天还多运了两次，运输效率提高50％。
    每逢雨天，这个公司都有二分之一以上的领导干部和科室干部到生产第一线。从公司的党委书记、经理到汽车场的总支书记、场长，都纷纷在现场设立指挥部，直接指挥生产，切切实实地解决一个个具体问题。保修工人也都背着工具箱，开着工具车，到现场去做维修保养车辆的工作。（附图片）
