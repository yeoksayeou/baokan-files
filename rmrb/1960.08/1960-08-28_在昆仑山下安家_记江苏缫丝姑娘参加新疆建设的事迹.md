Settling Down at the Foot of the Kunlun Mountains
——A Record of the Deeds of Jiangsu Silk-Reeling Girls Participating in the Construction of Xinjiang
By Our Correspondent Song Zhenghou
  The Legend of the "Ancient Silk Road"
    When people mention Hetian, they will think of the "Ancient Silk Road" known at home and abroad. Legend has it that in the second century AD, a young Han girl came from the inland, bringing some silkworm eggs and teaching local Uyghur farmers to raise silkworms. Since then, the seeds of silkworm breeding were sown in the northwest frontier of our country. As time went by, more and more people engaged in silkworm breeding. By the seventh century AD, Hetian had become the silkworm breeding center of Xinjiang, and it could also weave very good silk. After more than 1,300 years, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, Hetian silk suffered a catastrophe. Silkworm farmers suffered from heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies, and successively went bankrupt and changed their careers. By the time of liberation, silkworm production had almost disappeared. At the end of 1949, Hetian was liberated. In order to help Uyghur farmers restore silkworm production, the Party and the government successively transported fine silkworm breeds from Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other places. Hetian silk, which was once prosperous in history, began a new spring. In 1954, the state built Xinjiang's first modern silk-reeling factory in Lasqu, Hetian. Hetian's silk industry began a new page. In order to train a large number of Uyghur female workers, more than two hundred young Jiangsu silk-reeling girls volunteered to come to Xinjiang. Over the past few years, they have worked diligently at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains and forged a deep friendship with the Uyghur people, helping to train more than a thousand Uyghur silk-reeling female workers. Now, the silk-reeling factory is being expanded into a new type of comprehensive silk-reeling and weaving factory. When people think of the prosperity of the silkworm breeding industry here, the prosperity of the silk industry, and the hundreds of Jiangsu girls who have come from thousands of miles away, they will think of that moving story 1,800 years ago. The legend is beautiful, but real life is even more beautiful!
      "Stubborn Girls"
    "We kissed our loved ones goodbye and came to the frontier of the motherland. With beautiful ideals, we are building a lovely Xinjiang. Our thoughts and factories are growing together, and our will is becoming stronger and stronger. Our hearts have melted together with our brotherly nationalities, and this has become our second hometown." This is a passage written by Lu Aimei in her "Song of Building Xinjiang." Lu Aimei was one of the first girls to come to Hetian, and her poems and articles are a reflection of the thoughts of her and her partners. This poem often evokes a series of happy memories for the girls: It was in the spring of 1954 that they responded to the call of the Party and the government to support the development of the silk-reeling industry in the frontier. They set off from Wuxi and Suzhou, carrying the encouragement of relatives and friends and the wishes of their fathers and brothers, and embarked on a long journey of thousands of miles. Along the way, they kept calculating, "How much further? How many more days?" As soon as they arrived in Moyu (thirty miles from the factory), some people couldn't sit still and looked out of the window, looking for the factory chimney. When they arrived at Lasqu (the factory site), no one could believe that this was the home they had longed for for so long. Not only could they not see the towering chimney, but they didn't even know where the factory gate, the dining room, and the bathhouse were. The girls didn't care about these things. Everyone encouraged each other: "A beautiful picture is waiting for us to depict." When the factory started production, the raw materials and machines were far from what everyone had imagined. Even Zhou Feng'e, a skilled silk-reeling worker, seemed to have become a novice. It took her three days to open twenty magnetic eyes, but the output was less than half of that in her hometown. In the summer of 1956, nearly a hundred more partners came from Jiangsu. The girls' enthusiasm was even greater. They understood that as long as they had soaring enthusiasm, there was no ideal that could not be realized. Three to five years is not too long, but this group of girls has undergone amazing changes. More than 90% of them have joined the Party and the League, and ninety-nine have been rated as advanced producers. Guo Fengying and Xu A'er also had the honor of going to Beijing in 1958 and meeting Chairman Mao.
    The girls grew up in Hetian, and the girls took root at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains. Now, if you ask them if they are used to living here? They will answer in unison: "Mutton soup with steamed buns, fragrant and sweet"; If you ask them if they miss their homes? They will answer: "Our Hetian, our Lasqu, our silk factory, has long become our second hometown." No wonder, Comrade Saifuddin, Chairman of the Autonomous Region, gave the technician Zhang Shunhe a Uyghur name when he inspected here last year, which translates into Chinese as "Stubborn Girl." This is a true reflection of the growth process of more than two hundred Jiangsu girls.
      Spared no effort to impart technology
    The Party is cultivating these girls, and these girls have always kept in mind the Party's education to them: to pass on advanced silk-reeling technology to Uyghur sisters, and to make Uyghur girls also become silk-reeling experts. They regarded this work as an ideal and a wish. However, wishes and ideals are not so easy to realize. Most of the apprentices came from farming families, some were used to living in individual households, and some were used to grazing on the grasslands. It cannot be said that it was a world-shaking change when they first came to the factory to live a collective life. At first, they were not very accustomed to it. As a teacher, facing such problems, in order to complete the state's production plan, and in order for the first generation of Uyghur silk-reeling female workers to grow up rapidly, Team Leader Ying Yuqin, in order to make the workers learn faster, went back and forth with the workers, and repeatedly reminded everyone on the road, telling everyone not to miss the working hours. Failing to go to work on time not only affects production, but also makes it difficult to learn the technology well.
    Imparting technology also requires a lot of hard work. Female worker Guzarhan likes to say to everyone she meets: "Teacher Ma has spared no effort to teach me to use the hand that used to hold the sheep whip to reel smooth and soft silk." The Teacher Ma she is talking about is technician Ma Lijuan. Ma Lijuan did put in a lot of effort to train this Uyghur shepherd girl into a silk-reeling technician. Guzarhan had been herding sheep for the landlord since she was a child. Needless to say, her hands and feet were not very flexible when she came to the factory, and her attention was not very concentrated. Ma Lijuan patiently explained it again and again, even eight or ten times, how to thread the magnetic eye, how to pick up the floss cocoons.... If the explanation was not clear, she would demonstrate it herself or hold the other person's hand to teach them. What Guzarhan found most headache at first was that the action of making the sheath was not brisk. She often used her whole arm with force, just like driving sheep with a whip. As a result, not only did she not make the sheath well, but she also broke other sheath ends. In order to break through this barrier, Ma Lijuan held her elbow with one hand and did it one by one. This action took several days. Guzarhan once felt discouraged and felt that she could not become a talent. Ma Lijuan told her the stories of "The Foolish Old Man Who Moved Mountains" and "Grinding an Iron Rod into a Needle" to strengthen her confidence, and finally became a technician. Under Ma Lijuan's guidance, she can now explain technology to new Uyghur female workers in the classroom.
    In order to promote Uyghur female workers to learn the technology as soon as possible, the Han girls decided to make close friends with them. However, language barrier stumped these girls again, but this time they did not hesitate at all, and they were determined to overcome all difficulties. They learned from their students, starting from the things they encountered every day, learning a few sentences from this worker and using them when talking to that worker. After a while, they finally learned a kind of ethnic language. Now, more than twenty team leaders can talk freely with Uyghur female workers. Ma Lijuan and Zhang Shunhe can give technical lessons to workers in fluent Uyghur language, and Xu Kaixia, Pu Huixian and others have also cultivated a large number of Uyghur female workers to join the Party.
      Deep Friendship
    Living and working together, a deep friendship has been forged between Han and Uyghur female workers. If you ask how deep this friendship is? Team Leader Xia Huiying feels this very deeply. She has been working on the Uyghur female worker team for several years and often works and lives with them. Although she is only in her early twenties, she always feels more cordial to call her dozens of students "Barlang" (children), and her students are also accustomed to using Auntie and Adasi (dear friend) instead of the respectful title of "Teacher."
    Although some of them are still limited by language and cannot talk freely about their thoughts, who can say that they are not biological sisters? Gubizihan feels uncomfortable if she doesn't see her teacher Xia Huiying for a day. When Xia Huiying returned to East China to visit relatives last year, she murmured three times a day: "Where has the teacher gone now? Is she sick?" When the teacher is a little depressed, she chases after the reason like a child until her teacher smiles, then she feels relieved. Hamina Rouzi is even more of a naive child. Seeing that her teacher Wang Liuzhen has not returned home for seven years, she thinks day and night, "Is she not thinking about her relatives thousands of miles away?" One day, she finally couldn't suppress the excitement in her heart and urged her teacher to return to her hometown to visit relatives. Many Uyghur female workers also ask their teachers to make decisions when they find a spouse, and some people ask their teachers to attend the naming ceremony when they have children. If they don't go, they will drag the donkey from their home to the door of your dormitory to pick you up.
    These affectionate Uyghur girls will also respect and care for their Han elder sisters. When alfalfa sprouts, they will send the sprouts to their teachers according to Uyghur customs to wish them a happy new year; When the first heavy snow covers the ground, they will shout "Karel (snowball) Dasi (pocket)" and stuff the teacher with a piece of paper with a poem written on it to wish the teacher to spend the severe winter healthily. In June and July, they will prepare fresh melons and fruits for their teachers, and during the Corban Festival, they will invite their teachers to visit their homes. Even their parents and husbands will respectfully call the teacher "Ririmande" (meaning respect).
    Their friendship is not only limited to taking care of each other in life. Deputy Director Maimaitiming told me: the girls are already flesh and blood. It turned out that there was such a thing: One night last spring, Han worker Li Miaozhen suffered from a severe stomach ulcer, lost too much blood, and fell into a coma. She was sent to Hetian Hospital that night and needed a blood transfusion for emergency treatment. Somehow the news spread, and Uyghur female workers woke up one by one. In an instant, the yard was full of people, unanimously asking to go to Hetian to donate blood for their Han elder sister. After repeated dissuasion by the Party Committee, there were still fifty or sixty people who got on the bus. When they arrived at the hospital, everyone squeezed forward, Bamuhan was originally fat, she squeezed while sweating profusely and shouting: "I have blood; donate it, my body is the best."
    The matter has been more than a year, and the Han female workers still have a deep memory in their hearts; However, for the Uyghur female workers, the most impressive thing is another thing that happened even earlier. That was in the early days of the factory's construction. The factory sent more than seventy Uyghur girls to Suzhou for training. Among them, a female worker named Nurnisa Xilifu gave birth to a child not long after she went there. The child was dying as soon as it was born. In order to save the child, the Han elder sisters ran around looking for famous doctors; and found the only electric incubator in Suzhou at that time. After rescue, the child survived. In order to take care of Nurnisa Xilifu's studies, the hospital had been taking care of her for five months. Before leaving, some Han female workers gave clothes, some gave milk powder, and some gave shoes and socks. It is said that even the shoes that the child would wear at the age of two were all prepared. In order not to forget the care of the Han elder sisters, the Uyghur girl specially named the child "Religu", which means "happy flower". (Attached picture)

    在昆仑山下安家
    ——记江苏缫丝姑娘参加新疆建设的事迹
    本报记者　宋政厚
  “古丝道”的传说
    人们提起和田，就会联想到闻名中外的“古丝道”。相传在公元二世纪，从内地来了一位年轻的汉族姑娘，带来了一些蚕种，教当地维吾尔族农民养蚕，从此，我国西北边疆便播下了养蚕的种子。随着时间的流逝，从事养蚕的人越来越多，到公元七世纪，和田便成了新疆的养蚕中心，并且还能织出很好的丝绸。经过一千三百多年，到了国民党反动统治年代，和田蚕丝遭到浩劫，蚕农苦于苛赋杂税，相继破产改业，临近解放时，蚕桑生产几乎消灭殆尽了。1949年底和田解放，党和政府为了扶助维吾尔族农民恢复蚕桑生产，陆续从江苏、浙江等地运来优良蚕种，在历史上一度繁荣的和田蚕丝，又开始恢复了青春。1954年，国家在和田拉斯奎兴建了新疆第一座现代化的缫丝工厂，和田蚕丝事业开始了新的一页。为了培养大批维吾尔族女工，两百多名年轻的江苏缫丝女工，又自愿来到新疆。几年来，她们在昆仑山下辛勤工作，和维吾尔族人民结下了深厚的情谊，帮助当地培养出一千多维吾尔族缫丝女工。现在，缫丝厂正在扩建成为一座新型的缫丝织绸综合工厂。当人们想到这里养蚕事业的兴隆，丝绸工业的昌盛，想到迢迢万里而来的这几百名江苏姑娘，就会联想到一千八百年以前那一个动人的故事。传说是美丽的，而现实生活更美！
      “倔强的姑娘”
    “我们吻别了自己的亲人，来到了祖国的边疆。怀着美好的理想，建设可爱的新疆。我们的思想和工厂一同成长，我们的意志越来越坚强。我们的心已和兄弟民族溶在一起，这里已经成为我们的第二故乡。”这是陆爱梅写在她的“建设新疆之歌”中的一段。陆爱梅是第一批来到和田的姑娘，她的诗文正是她和她的伙伴们的思想的写照。这首诗也常常引起姑娘们一连串幸福的回忆：那还是1954年的春天，她们响应党和政府支援边疆发展缫丝工业的号召，从无锡、苏州动身，带着亲友的勉励、父兄的祝愿，迈上了万里长途。沿路她们不断地盘算着，“还有多远？还要走多少天？”刚到墨玉（距厂三十里），就有人坐不住了，凭窗眺望，寻找着工厂的烟囱。到了拉斯奎（厂址），谁也不敢相信这里就是向往已久的家园，不仅看不到高耸入云的烟囱，就连工厂大门、餐厅、澡塘也不知在哪个角落。姑娘们并不在乎这些，大家互相勉励：“美丽的画图，正待我们描绘。”工厂开工生产了，从原料到机器远不如大家的设想，就连熟练的缫丝工周凤娥，也像是成了生手，经过三天才算是开足二十个磁眼，但产量还不足故乡一半。1956年夏天，从江苏又来了近百名伙伴。姑娘们的劲头更大了。她们懂得只要有冲天干劲，没有实现不了的理想。三五年并不太长，这批姑娘却起了惊人的变化。她们当中已经有90％以上的人加入了党和团，有九十九名被评为先进生产者，过凤英、徐阿二还在1958年光荣地到过北京，见了毛主席。
    姑娘们在和田成长，姑娘们在昆仑山下扎下了根。现在要问她们生活得惯吗？她们会异口同声地回答：“羊肉汤泡馍馍，又香又甜”；若问她们想家吗？她们又会回答：“我们的和田，我们的拉斯奎，我们的丝厂，早已成了第二故乡。”难怪，自治区主席赛福鼎同志去年视察这里，给技术员张顺和送了个维吾尔族名字，翻成汉语的意思是“倔强的姑娘”。这正是对两百多名江苏姑娘成长过程的写照。
      费尽苦心传授技术
    党培养着这些姑娘，这些姑娘也一直牢记着党对她们的教育：要把先进的缫丝技术，传授给维吾尔族姐妹，要让维吾尔族姑娘也成为缫丝的能手。她们把这种工作当成理想和愿望。但是，愿望和理想也不是那么容易实现的。徒工们大都是农家出身，有的过惯了一家一户的生活，有的习惯在草原上放牧，初到工厂过集体生活，不能不说是一次翻天覆地的变化。起初，她们不大习惯。作为老师，面临着这样的问题，为了完成国家生产计划，为了维吾尔族第一代缫丝女工迅速成长，台长应玉琴，为了使工人学得更快，自己便同工人同去同来，在路上还一再提醒大家，告诉大家不要误了上工时间。不按时上工，既影响生产，也难学好技术。
    传授技术，也得花费很大的劳动。女工古札而汗逢人就喜欢说：“马老师费尽了心机，教会我用拿羊鞭的手，缫出了光滑柔软的丝。”她所讲的马老师就是技术员马丽娟。马丽娟把这个维吾尔族牧羊姑娘培养成缫丝的技术员，确实费过心思。古札而汗从小就给地主放羊，不用说，来到工厂手脚是不很灵便的，注意力也不太集中。马丽娟便不厌其烦地一次两次，以至八次十次地讲解，如何穿磁眼，如何取落绪茧……。讲解不清，就自己动手表演或扶着对方的手教。古札而汗起初最头痛的是做鞘的动作不轻快，常常像拿着鞭子赶羊一样，全臂都用上了劲，结果不仅鞘没做好，还打断了其它鞘绪。为了突破这一关，马丽娟便一手托住她的肘部，一个一个地做。这样一个动作就占去几天时间。古札尔汗曾一度灰过心，觉得成不了材，马丽娟便给她讲“愚公移山”、“铁棒磨针”的故事，坚定了她的信心，终于成了技术员。她现在在马丽娟的辅导下，还能在课堂上，向新来的维吾尔族女工讲解技术。
    为了促使维吾尔族女工尽快学好技术，汉族姑娘们便决定要同她们交知心朋友。可是，语言不通又难住了这些姑娘，不过，这回她们丝毫也没有犹豫，学的狠心排除了一切困难。向学生学，从每天碰到的东西学起，向这个工人学了几句，就在同那个工人谈话时用。时间过了不久，她们终于学会了一种民族语言。现在，二十多个台长，都能和维吾尔族女工畅谈自如，马丽娟、张顺和能以流利的维吾尔族话给工人们开技术课，许开霞、浦惠仙等还培养了大批维吾尔族女工入了党。
      深厚的友情
    一块生活，一块劳动，在汉族和维吾尔族女工之间，已经结下了深厚的友情，要问这种友情究竟多深？台长夏惠英对这点感受很深。她在维吾尔族女工台上工作几年了，常与她们劳动、生活在一起。虽然，她也不过是二十挂零，但是她总觉得用“巴郎”（孩子）称呼她的几十个学生更为亲切，她的这些学生也惯于用阿姨和阿达西（亲爱的朋友）代替“老师”的尊称。
    她们当中有些人虽然还受着语言的限制，彼此不能畅谈心思，但是谁又能说她们不是亲生姐妹呢？古比孜汗一天不见她的夏惠英老师，就感到不自在。去年夏惠英回华东探亲，她就一天三次地叨念着：“老师现在到了哪里？是否生了病？”当老师有些愁闷，她就像孩子似地追究原因，直到她的老师现出微笑，她才放下心来。哈米娜肉孜更是个天真的孩子，见到她的汪榴珍老师七年没回家，就朝朝夕夕想着“隔家万里，就不想念亲人吗？”一天，她终于压抑不住内心的激动，催促老师回乡探亲。有许多维吾尔族女工找爱人，也要请老师作主，有些人生下孩子，要请老师参加命名典礼，若不去，他还会从家里把毛驴拉到你的宿舍门前接你。
    这些多情的维吾尔族姑娘，更会尊重和体念她们的汉族大姐，当苜蓿发出幼芽，她们会按照维吾尔人的习惯，将幼芽送给老师，以祝新春愉快；当第一次大雪盖地，她们又会一面喊着卡尔（雪团）达西（兜），一面向老师兜着写有诗句的纸条，以祝愿老师健康地度过严冬。六七月天，她们会为老师准备新鲜瓜果，库尔班节的时候，又会请老师登门作客。就连她们的父母、丈夫，也会尊称老师为“日日满得”（尊敬的意思）。
    她们的友谊不只是限制在生活上的彼此关照，副厂长买买提告诉我：姑娘们已经是血肉相连。原来有这样一桩事情：去年春上的一个深夜，汉族工人李妙珍，因患胃溃疡，病情严重，流血过多，一时昏迷倒地，当夜被送到和田医院，需要输血急救，消息不知怎么被传开了，维吾尔族女工一个叫醒一个，霎时，院里站满了人，一致要求去和田为汉族大姐输血。经过党委一再劝阻，还是有五六十人上了汽车。到了医院，个个直往前挤，巴木汗本来身体较胖，她满头大汗地一边挤一边喊：“血，我有；输吧，我的身体最好。”
    事情已经一年多了，在汉族女工心里，还留有深刻的记忆；可是，对维吾尔族女工来说，印象最深的，还是发生得更早的另一桩事情。那是建厂初期，工厂输送了七十多个维吾尔族姑娘去苏州培训，其中有个叫努尔尼沙西里甫的女工，去后不久，小产生了孩子，孩子一出世就已气息奄奄。为了救活孩子，汉族大姐们到处奔走，寻找名医；并找来当时苏州唯一的一架电温箱。经过抢救，孩子活了。为了照顾努尔尼沙西里甫学习，医院一直为她保育了五个月。临走时，汉族女工有的送衣服，有的送奶粉，还有的送鞋袜，听说连孩子两岁穿的鞋子都全给准备了。为了不忘汉族大姐的关怀，维吾尔族姑娘特为孩子取了个“热里古”的名字，意思是“幸福的花朵”。（附图片）
