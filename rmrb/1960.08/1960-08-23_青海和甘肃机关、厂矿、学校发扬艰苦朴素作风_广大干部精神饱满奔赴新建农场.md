Qinghai and Gansu Agencies, Factories, Mines, and Schools Promote the Spirit of Hard Work and Plain Living
A Vast Number of Cadres, Full of Energy, Head to Newly Built Farms

    (Reported by this newspaper) Qinghai Province's vast number of agency cadres and workers are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to run agriculture by the whole party and all the people. While tightly grasping the field management of the existing 300,000 mu of various crops on agency farms, they are launching a high tide of running agency farms on a large scale.
    Currently, a magnificent and powerful high tide of agency-run farms on a large scale has formed throughout Qinghai Province. Since late July, all agencies and units have generally made proper arrangements for internal business work, drawing out all forces that can be drawn to participate in land reclamation, expanding the existing six hundred or so farms, and carrying out the preparatory work for new farms. According to incomplete statistics, recently more than 10,000 cadres and workers from provincial-level agencies in the Xining area have successively carried their backpacks and tools to various places to expand and build new agency farms.
    The vast number of cadres and workers have demonstrated revolutionary vigor and full of labor enthusiasm in land reclamation and construction, and further promoted the style of hard work and plain living. More than 5,000 cadres and workers from more than 20 provincial-level agencies working on the agency farms by Qinghai Lake live in tents and sleep on the grassland. Although the material living conditions are relatively difficult, they are full of energy and diligently surveying wasteland and reclaiming land.
    In the movement to further run agency farms on a large scale, Party organizations at all levels in Qinghai Province have earnestly strengthened their leadership over this work, and regularly conduct education among the vast number of cadres and workers on the great significance of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and running agriculture on a large scale by the whole party and all the people. At the same time, all agencies and units have also universally established leadership and management organizations responsible for agency production, strengthening the leadership over the work of running farms on a large scale organizationally. Miao Xiusheng, secretary of the Party Committee of the Qinghai Provincial Highway Engineering Bureau, personally led a group of cadres and workers in July to climb mountains and wade through rivers to survey sites in Henan Mongolian Autonomous County and other places. Tian Huapei, deputy director of the bureau, and the cadres and workers reclaimed wasteland together, greatly inspiring the enthusiasm of all cadres and workers, and making the work of land reclamation and construction proceed quickly and well.
    At present, the movement to run agency farms on a large scale in various agencies and units in Qinghai is developing vigorously. At the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, by the Qinghai Lake, and on the vast grasslands on both banks of the source of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, batches of new agency farms are being established like bamboo shoots after a rain, powerfully changing the face of these areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 22nd. While actively supporting agriculture, agencies, factories, mines, and schools in Gansu Province are establishing their own non-staple food production bases.

    Since October last year, agencies, factories, mines, and schools throughout the province have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to engage in non-staple food production on a large scale in all walks of life, and have widely carried out production activities such as growing vegetables, raising pigs, and raising poultry. Many units have organized labor to reclaim wasteland and establish non-staple food production bases, which has greatly developed the production of non-staple foods in agencies and significantly improved the lives of workers. The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in addition to growing vegetables and raising pigs within the agency, has also established farms and pastures on large tracts of wasteland in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and has now reclaimed more than 4,300 mu, all of which have been planted with vegetables, highland barley, potatoes, oats, and oil crops; the number of pigs has increased from the original 30 to more than 800, and 1,700 sheep are also being raised. Various units in the provincial cultural and educational system have planted more than 2,000 mu of vegetables near their residences, and have harvested more than 1.5 million jin of various vegetables. Each unit has also planted more than 1,000 mu of vegetables and more than 3,000 mu of grain crops on the non-staple food production bases, and raised a large number of livestock and poultry such as pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, rabbits, and dairy cows. Agencies, factories, mines, and schools in various special districts, cities, and counties are also establishing a large number of non-staple food production bases while planting vegetables around houses and along roadsides.
    The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently summarized the work of these units in establishing production bases, and believes that this is a major event with economic and political significance. The Provincial Party Committee requires all agencies and units to immediately start establishing their own production bases in accordance with the production policy of taking vegetable growing and pig raising as the key link and developing vegetables, meat, grain, and oil in an all-round way, and earnestly implementing the principle of diligence and thrift in running all undertakings. This call was immediately enthusiastically responded to by all agencies, factories, mines, and schools in the province. More than 30 units, including the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Provincial Bureau of Geology, the Planning Commission, the Materials Reserve Bureau, and the Lanzhou Refinery, which started earlier, have also drawn out a group of laborers, carrying tents, camp beds, and production tools, and rushed to Gannan, the Hexi Corridor, and other places to reclaim wasteland and establish farms, pastures, forestry farms, fish farms, and bee farms. Agencies, factories, mines, and schools at the special district and county levels are also actively preparing to build their own production bases according to the number of people in their units, adopting the method of independent operation or joint operation.
    In order to strengthen the leadership over this work, the Provincial Party Committee established a Life and Welfare Committee, headed by a secretary of the Secretariat, to be specifically responsible for leading this work. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, corresponding agencies have also been established in various special districts, cities, and counties to vigorously grasp agency production.

    青海和甘肃机关、厂矿、学校发扬艰苦朴素作风
    广大干部精神饱满奔赴新建农场
    本报讯　青海省广大机关干部、职工，热烈响应中共青海省委全党全民办农业的号召，在抓紧机关农场现有三十多万亩各类作物田间管理的同时，掀起了一个大办机关农场的高潮。
    现在，一个规模壮阔、声势浩大的机关大办农场的运动高潮，已经在青海全省形成。各个机关单位7月下旬以来，都普遍对机关内部的业务工作作了妥善安排，抽调出一切可以抽调的力量参加垦荒，对现有的六百多个农场进行扩建，并进行新农场的筹建工作。据不完全统计，最近西宁地区省级机关单位就有一万多名干部、职工，先后背起背包、带着工具纷纷奔赴各地去扩建、新建机关农场。
    广大机关干部和职工在开荒建场中，都表现出了革命干劲和饱满的劳动热情，进一步发扬了艰苦朴素的作风。在青海湖畔机关农场劳动的二十多个省级机关单位的五千多名干部职工，住帐篷、睡草地，物质生活条件虽然比较艰苦，但他们精神饱满，辛勤地勘察荒地、开荒。
    在进一步大办机关农场的运动中，青海省各级党组织都切实加强了对这一工作的领导，经常向广大干部职工进行国民经济以农业为基础、全党全民大办农业重大意义的教育。同时，各个机关单位还普遍成立了负责机关生产领导管理机构，从组织上加强对大办农场工作的领导。青海省公路工程局党委书记苗秀生，7月份亲自带领一批干部和职工，翻山涉水，前往河南蒙族自治县等地勘察场址，副局长田华培和干部、职工们一起开垦荒地，大大地鼓舞了全体干部、职工的干劲，使开荒建场工作进行得又快又好。
    目前，青海各个机关单位大办农场的运动，正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展。在昆仑山下、青海湖边，以及黄河、长江源头两岸的辽阔草原上，一批批新的机关农场正在像雨后春笋一样地建立起来，有力地改变着这些地区的面貌。
    据新华社兰州22日电　甘肃省各机关、厂矿、学校，在积极支援农业的同时，正在建立自己的副食品生产基地。
    从去年10月开始，全省各机关、厂矿、学校就热烈响应中共甘肃省委提出的各行各业大搞副食品生产的号召，广泛开展了种菜、养猪、养家禽等生产活动。许多单位组织劳力开垦荒地，建立副食品生产基地，使机关副食品生产有了很大发展，职工生活有了显著改善。中共甘肃省委机关，除在本机关内种菜、养猪外，并在甘南藏族自治州的大片荒地上建立了农牧场，现在已开荒四千三百多亩，并全部种上了蔬菜、青稞、洋芋、燕麦和油料；猪由原来的三十头发展到八百多头，还养羊一千七百只。省级文教系统各单位，在驻地附近种蔬菜两千多亩，目前已收获各种蔬菜一百五十多万斤。各单位并在副食品生产基地上种蔬菜一千多亩，粮食作物三千多亩，养有大量猪、羊、鸡、鸭、兔、奶牛等家畜家禽。各专区、市、县的机关、厂矿、学校，也在利用房前屋后、渠旁路边种植蔬菜的同时，建立了大量副食品生产基地。
    中共甘肃省委最近总结了这些单位建立生产基地的工作，认为这是一件具有经济意义和政治意义的大事。省委要求一切机关单位，本着以种菜、养猪为纲，菜、肉、粮、油全面发展的生产方针，认真贯彻勤俭办一切事业的原则，立即动手建立自己的生产基地。这一号召立即得到全省各机关、厂矿和学校的热烈响应。动手较早的共青团甘肃省委、省地质局、计划委员会、物资储备局和兰州炼油厂等三十多个单位，并已抽出一批劳力，携带着帐篷、行军床和生产工具，奔赴甘南、河西走廊等地开垦荒地，建立农场、牧场、林场、鱼场、蜂场等。专区、县级的各机关、厂矿和学校，也都根据本单位人员的多少，采取单独经营或联合经营的办法，积极筹建自己的生产基地。
    为了加强对这一工作的领导，省委成立了生活福利委员会，由书记处一位书记挂帅，专门负责领导这一工作。根据省委指示，各专区、市、县也都成立了相应的机构，大抓机关生产。（附图片）
