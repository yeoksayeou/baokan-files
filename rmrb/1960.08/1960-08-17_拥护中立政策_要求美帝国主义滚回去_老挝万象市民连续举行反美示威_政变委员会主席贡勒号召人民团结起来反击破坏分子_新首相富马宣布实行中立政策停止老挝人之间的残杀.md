Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: According to a France-Presse report from Vientiane on the 15th, when the Lao National Assembly held a meeting on the 15th, Vientiane citizens held demonstrations with placards advocating neutrality and opposing American imperialism, expressing their support for Coup Committee Chairman Captain Kong Le.

It is reported that before this, when the National Assembly voted on the 13th to not recognize the former Chao Sisouk na Champassak government, 15,000 people held a large anti-American imperialism demonstration in front of the National Assembly.

According to a United Press International report, one of the flags held by the demonstrators depicted Uncle Sam wearing a top hat, carrying a heavy bag filled with dollars. Another placard read: "U.S. Imperialism Get Out". Some placards also criticized the former Chao Sisouk na Champassak government for "being dependent on foreign countries."

According to an Associated Press report from Vientiane on the 15th, the youths in the demonstration shouted: "Americans get out, we don't want you." Some people held banners that read: "Let us kick out the Americans and those who follow them."

It is reported that Associated Press photographer Walters and Associated Press part-time reporter Anat were "kicked several times."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th: According to Vientiane Radio broadcast on the evening of the 15th, the Coup Committee announced that many people continue to write to the Coup Committee, expressing their firm support for its neutral policy.

According to the broadcast, Captain Kong Le, in the name of the Chairman of the Coup Committee, expressed his deep gratitude to the people who wrote letters, and assured the people that the Coup Committee would resolutely implement a genuine neutral policy, not leaning to either side. The Coup Committee also requested the people to cooperate with the Coup Committee to ensure that the Coup Committee's deep aspirations can be realized. Vientiane Radio also broadcast on the evening of the 15th, Coup Committee Chairman Captain Kong Le issued a proclamation to the entire Lao people, calling on the Lao people to further unite and adhere to the neutral policy proposed by the Coup Committee. The proclamation reiterated, "Accept assistance from all countries willing to establish friendly relations with Laos without any conditions attached."

The proclamation stated that the work of the Coup Committee since August 9th has achieved many satisfactory results, thanks to the valuable assistance of compatriots throughout the country.

The proclamation stated, "If Laos wants to gain a firm foothold in the world in the future, it must first rely on its own efforts and on itself."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 15th: Vientiane Radio broadcast a speech by Coup Committee Chairman Captain Kong Le on the afternoon of the 14th. He said that the people who love the motherland and the neutral policy wrote to him that many parties, many groups, and some individuals have used the power of money to buy people's hearts. He said, "Compatriots who love the motherland, love neutrality, love justice and reason, do not believe them. If any element wants to use the power of money to oppose, threaten, and undermine my policies, you should arrest this person who is attacking my policies and immediately bring him to the Chief of Staff of the Coup Committee. I am always ready to serve the people."

Kong Le said, "All Laotians know that in the past, every government has declared itself neutral, but this is a neutral in the style of the free world, so I am thoroughly disgusted with this kind of neutrality. Neutrality must be genuine neutrality. Sitting in a boat should be in the middle, if you sit on one side, the boat will sink and people will drown, and the whole country will perish. Now I have made up my mind not to let Laos become someone else's country or let it perish."

Kong Le said that if anyone in the government attempts to rebel, "Compatriots, arrest him and hand him over to the Chairman of the Coup Committee. But I have never killed anyone, therefore, I will not take excessive measures to punish him. Currently, I have arrested many people, seventy or eighty people." He asked those who cooperated with him to give him active support. He said, "We oppose any country that invades us."

Kong Le said, "My battalion has been established for more than two years, and has been active from north to south, killing many Laotians, but I have never seen Vietnamese people, nor have I seen Chinese people, only Laotians. I have seen this with my own eyes, therefore, I suggest that patriotic compatriots support us."

Kong Le emphasized, "We do not want to fight, but if anyone sends troops to fight us, we will be forced to fight and defend the lives of the people."

Kong Le said, "As for the issue of eliminating corrupt and bribe-taking, free-riding elements, I must eliminate them all."

Kong Le called on the people of Laos to stand up and fight. He finally said, "Soldiers across the country, people who love the motherland, love religion, and love the royal court, if you want the motherland to exist forever, then, if those officers tell you to eliminate us, you must immediately eliminate them. Because they are telling you to kill each other, and give your lives in vain, while they don't go, they are at home, and they have cars, and it is you and the people who are giving your lives, isn't it? I give my life to the people, I have sacrificed everything for the people. If I die, patriotic people must continue to fight until complete victory is achieved."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th: According to Vientiane Radio broadcast, the new Prime Minister of Laos, Prince Souvanna Phouma, announced the policies of the new cabinet and the list of members of the new cabinet at the meeting of the Lao National Assembly held this morning.

    新首相富马宣布实行中立政策停止老挝人之间的残杀
    新华社16日讯　据法新社15日自万象报道，15日老挝国民议会举行会议的时候万象市民举着主张中立和反对美国帝国主义的标语牌进行了示威，表示拥护政变委员会主席贡勒大尉。
    据报道在此以前，当国民议会13日投票不承认前昭·松萨尼特政府时，曾有一万五千名群众在国民议会前举行了反对美国帝国主义大示威。
    据合众国际社报道，示威群众的一面旗帜上画着戴高帽的山姆大叔，把画有美元的一个很沉的袋子拿出来。另一个标语牌上写道：“美帝国主义滚回去”。有的标语牌上还写着斥责前昭·松萨尼特政府“依附外国”的字句。
    据美联社15日自万象报道，示威群众中的青年高呼：“美国人滚回去，我们不要你们”。有些人拿着的横幅标语上写道：“让我们踢走美国人和那些跟随他们的人”。
    据报道，美联社摄影记者华特斯和美联社兼职记者阿纳特就“挨了好几脚”。
    新华社河内16日电　据万象电台15日晚上广播，政变委员会宣布，继续有许多人写信给政变委员会，表示坚决支持它奉行的中立政策。
    据广播，贡勒大尉以政变委员会主席的名义对写信的人表示深深的谢意，并向人民保证，政变委员会将坚决实现真正的中立政策，不倒向任何一边。政变委员会还要求人民同政变委员会合作，以保证政变委员会的深切愿望能够付诸实现。万象电台15日晚间还广播，老挝政变委员会主席贡勒大尉发表告全民书，要求老挝人民进一步团结一致，坚持政变委员会提出的中立政策。告全民书重申，“在不受任何条件束缚的前提下，接受愿意同老挝建立友好关系的所有国家的援助。”
    告全民书说，政变委员会8月9日以来的工作取得了许多令人满意的结果，这是由于全国同胞的可贵的帮助。
    告全民书说，“我们老挝今后如要在世界上站稳，首先必须自力更生，必须依靠自己”。
    新华社河内15日电　万象电台在14日下午广播了老挝政变委员会主席贡勒大尉发表的讲话，他说，爱祖国、爱中立政策的人民写信告诉他，有许多党派、许多集团和一些个人已经用金钱的势力来收买人民。他说，“爱祖国、爱中立、爱正义和公理的同胞们不要相信它们。如果那一个分子想用金钱的势力来反对、威胁和破坏我的政策，你们就把这个向我的政策进攻的人抓起来马上把他带到政变委员会参谋长那里来。我随时准备为人民服务。”
    贡勒说，“老挝人都知道，过去以来，那一个政府也宣布是中立的，但是这是自由世界式的中立，因此，我对这种中立厌恶透了。中立必须是真正的中立。坐船要坐在中间，如果坐在一边，船就会沉下去，人就会淹死，这样整个国家就会灭亡。现在我已经下决心，决不让老挝变成别的国家的国家或让它灭亡下去。”
    贡勒说，任何政府的人企图叛变，“同胞们就把他抓起来交给政变委员会主席。但我从没有杀过人，因此，我将不采取过激的手段加以处分。目前，我已经抓到许多人，有七十、八十个人。”他要求同他合作的人给他积极支持。他说，“任何国家来侵略我们，我们都反对。”
    贡勒说，“我的营成立有两年多了，从北到南地进行活动，杀了许多老挝人，但我从没有看到越南人，也没有看到中国人，只看到老挝人，我亲眼看到这样情况，因此，建议爱国同胞们支持我们。”
    贡勒强调说，“我们不要打仗，但谁出兵打我们，我们就被迫战斗，保卫人民的生命。”
    贡勒说，“至于清除贪污行贿、不劳而获的分子这个问题，我一定要清除光。”
    贡勒号召老挝全国人民站起来斗争。他最后说，“全国的士兵们，爱祖国、爱宗教、爱皇廷的人们，如果你们要祖国永远存在，那么，那些军官叫你们去消灭我们，你们要马上消灭他们。因为他们叫你们去互相残杀，白白地送命，而他们却不去，他们在家里，还有汽车，送命就是你们和人民，是不是？我把我的生命交给人民，我已经为人民牺牲了一切。如果我死了的话，爱国的人民要继续斗争，直到取得完全胜利为止。”
