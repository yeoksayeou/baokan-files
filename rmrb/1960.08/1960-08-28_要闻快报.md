	Hunan Builds Railways Between Factories and Mines
	Hunan Province has built 47 small, indigenous and foreign railways near mines and iron and steel enterprises in the province this year, with a total length of 340 kilometers, and they are already open to traffic. Currently, there are 23 more small railways under construction, with a total length of 182 kilometers. Among these completed and soon-to-be-completed small railways, 42 connect more than 50 mines and iron and steel plants, and another 25 connect factories and mines directly to railway trunk lines, highways, and waterway ports.
	The construction of these small railways not only ensures the timely transportation of iron and steel materials, but also saves a large amount of labor from short-distance transportation lines, greatly strengthening the agricultural production front.

	Half of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company Cadres Reach the Front Line
	Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company has sent half of the cadres from its 20 functional departments and more than 40 subordinate factories, mines, and branch companies to strengthen the production front line. These cadres are assigned according to production needs and their own expertise, adopting three forms: some form tackling-key-problems groups, participating in production while solving key production issues; some go to the grassroots units with the most problems, serving as leaders of workshops and sections; some cadres regularly tour factories, workshops, sections, and groups to help with work. The common requirement of these three forms is that leading cadres take the lead, base themselves on participating in production, and be responsible for solving key production problems and helping backward units to the end. In this way, these three forms combine participation in production with leading production, and combine going deep into typical cases with guiding the general, playing a huge role in increasing steel production.

	Shanghai Promotes Experience of "Politics at the Furnace"
	The experience of "Politics at the Furnace" at No. 1 Pig Iron Furnace of No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, which broke through the technical barriers of large pig iron furnaces nationwide, is being widely promoted in steel plants throughout Shanghai, continuously improving the production level of pig iron furnaces throughout the city. The average melting rate of large pig iron furnaces in the city has now increased from about ten tons per hour to about fourteen tons per hour, thereby promoting a steady rise in steel production. In mid-August, the city's daily steel production increased by 12.1 percent compared to the first ten days of the month.

	Using the Same Amount of Materials to Make More Products
	Leading cadres and workers of Xi'an Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Plant, together, adopted the "five-side" method of designing, trial-producing, researching, modifying, and calculating simultaneously, boldly breaking the limitations of old drawings and reforming the design of eleven types of motor products. This resulted in less material input, higher work efficiency, lower costs, and reduced labor intensity. Compared with before the reforms, these products, in the first half of this year alone, can increase motor capacity by 43,000 kilowatts with the same amount of raw materials and manpower as originally planned, equivalent to producing 25,000 more 1.7-kilowatt motors. Therefore, after these products were put into production, a new situation of comprehensive production improvement emerged in the factory.

	Adhere to the Use of Advanced Cutting Tools
	Kunming Machine Tool Plant persists in promoting the use of advanced cutting tools. Since the beginning of this year, major advanced cutting tools have been innovated and promoted in turning, fitting, planing, and drilling, totaling 59 items. In order to widely promote and insist on using advanced cutting tools, the plant's technical department organized a "treasure-gathering" team of three-way combinations to collect and sort out advanced experiences, and incorporated tools with general promotion significance into the tool manufacturing plan. At present, eleven types of standardized advanced cutting tools have been put into mass production, increasing production efficiency by an average of one to thirty-five times.

    要闻快报
    湖南厂矿之间建铁路
    湖南省今年在省内矿山和钢铁企业附近建成了四十七条土洋小铁路，并已通车，总长度为三百四十公里；目前还有二十三条总长一百八十二公里的小铁路正在铺轨。在这些已经竣工和即将竣工的小铁路中，有四十二条使五十多个矿山和钢铁厂串连了起来，另有二十五条使厂矿直接同铁路干线、公路、水运港站相衔接。
    这些小铁路的兴建，不仅保证了钢铁物资的及时调运，而且使大量的劳动力从短途运输线上节约下来，大大加强了农业生产战线。
    太钢半数干部到达第一线
    太原钢铁公司二十个职能处和公司下属的四十多个厂矿、分公司，已下放半数干部加强生产第一线。这些干部下放，根据生产需要并结合本身业务，采取了三种形式：有的组成攻关小组，边参加生产，边解决生产关键问题；有的到问题最多的基层，分别担任车间和工段的领导职务；有的干部定期到厂、车间、工段和小组巡回帮助工作。这三种形式共同的要求是，由领导干部带头，以参加生产为基础，对解决生产关键问题和帮助后进单位负责到底。这样，这三种形式就把参加生产和领导生产结合起来，深入典型和指导一般结合起来，对增产钢铁起了巨大作用。
    上海推广政治上炉前的经验
    上钢三厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉
  “政治上炉前”、突破全国大型化铁炉技术关的经验，正在上海市各炼钢厂普遍推广，使全市化铁炉的生产水平不断提高。现在全市大型化铁炉平均每小时的熔化率由十吨左右提高到十四吨左右，从而促进了钢的产量稳步上升。八月中旬，全市钢的日产量比上旬增长百分之十二点一。
    用等量材料造更多产品
    西安电机制造厂领导干部和工人一起，采取边设计、边试制、边研究、边修改、边计算的“五边”办法，大胆打破旧图纸的限制，改革了十一种电机产品的设计，收到了投料少、工效高、成本低，减轻劳动强度的效果。这些产品和改革前比较，仅今年上半年，用等量的原材料和人力，就可以比原计划增加电机容量四万三千瓩，相当于多生产一点七瓩的电动机二万五千台。因此这些产品投入生产以后，使这个厂出现了生产全面提高的新局面。
    坚持使用先进刀具
    昆明机床厂坚持推广使用先进刀具。今年以来，车，钳，刨，钻等工种革新和推广了重大的先进刀具五十九项。为了使先进刀具广泛推广和坚持使用，这个厂的技术科室，组织了三结合的“聚宝”队，搜集、整理先进经验，并对有普遍推广意义的刀具编入工具制造计划。目前已有十一种定型的先进刀具成批投入生产，使生产效率平均提高一倍到三十五倍。
