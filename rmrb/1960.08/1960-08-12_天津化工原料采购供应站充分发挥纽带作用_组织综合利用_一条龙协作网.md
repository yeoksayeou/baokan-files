Tianjin, August 11th (by our newspaper) The Tianjin Chemical Raw Materials Purchasing and Supply Station has been playing the role of a commercial link, organizing a comprehensive utilization "one-dragon cooperative network." In the first half of this year alone, through the comprehensive utilization cooperative network, it has recovered, refined, or produced 97 kinds of chemical raw materials from the waste residue and liquid waste of more than 20 large factories, totaling more than 6,200 tons, equivalent to 56% of the chemical raw materials allocated to Tianjin by the state in the first half of the year.

The staff of this station, through business activities, often communicate with more than ten industries such as chemical, pharmaceutical, dye, and paper-making, and deeply know that these industries have a lot of waste materials in the production process. According to a survey, more than 100 factories in the city's chemical industry departments discard more than 100 kinds of waste materials every year, totaling about 400,000 tons, which can be used to produce more than 100 kinds of chemical raw materials totaling more than 80,000 tons. Since the beginning of this year, many factories have launched mass movements to vigorously promote comprehensive utilization and diversified operations. Many factories have used their own waste materials to produce the raw materials they need. However, some factories, after engaging in comprehensive utilization, produce many products that are not needed by their own factories. Moreover, often a kind of waste material can be used to produce product A or refine product B. Because these factories do not understand the varieties that are most urgently needed in industrial production, the phenomenon often occurs where the market needs product A, but the factory produces product B. At the same time, some factories have not been able to fully utilize waste materials due to limitations of equipment, manpower, and financial resources.

In response to this situation, the Party organization of this station decided to further play the role of the commercial sector. Under the unified leadership of the district Party committees in various districts, it organized factories with the necessary conditions to establish a comprehensive utilization "one-dragon cooperative network," fully utilizing existing waste materials to produce chemical raw materials urgently needed in the market. In the past two months, it has organized 174 factories to establish fixed cooperative relationships with 23 large factories such as the Paint and Pigment General Factory and the People's Pharmaceutical Factory. At present, this work is still being actively carried out. It has been decided to strive to organize the production of 20,000 tons of chemical raw materials by the end of the year through this approach.

The form of the "one-dragon cooperative network" includes factory-factory cooperation and factory-commune cooperation. In factory-factory cooperation, some involve one factory using the waste materials of another factory to process and produce industrial raw materials; others involve the waste materials of one factory being the production raw materials of another factory, which are taken away and used directly for production. Factory-commune cooperation is entirely based on the waste material resources of large industries for commune industries to establish or develop chemical factories, becoming satellite factories or workshops for the comprehensive utilization of large factories.

Establishing a comprehensive utilization one-dragon cooperation has the characteristics of being quick to start and highly effective, adapting to the needs of current high-speed industrial production for raw materials. Among the 97 kinds of chemical raw materials that have already been produced in the first half of the year, 32 varieties such as oleic acid, chloroform, and butyl ester, which previously relied on supplies from other places for a long time, have achieved self-sufficiency, and four advanced products, such as sodium dichromate and plasticizers, which were once dependent on imports, have also been produced.

    天津化工原料采购供应站充分发挥纽带作用
    组织综合利用“一条龙协作网”
    本报天津11日电　天津化工原料采购供应站发挥商业纽带作用，组织综合利用“一条龙协作网”。仅今年上半年，就通过综合利用协作网，从二十多个大工厂的废渣废液中，回收提炼或生产出的化工原料达九十七种，共六千二百多吨，相当于上半年国家分配给天津化工原料的56％。
    这个站的职工通过业务活动，经常与化工、制药、染料、造纸等十多个行业联系，深深知道这些行业在生产过程中的下脚废料很多。据调查：全市化学工业部门的一百多个工厂每年抛弃的下脚废料有一百多种共四十万吨左右，可以用来生产上百种的化工原料八万多吨。今年以来，许多工厂开展了大搞综合利用、多种经营的群众运动，不少工厂利用本厂的废料，生产出自己所需的原料。但是也有一些工厂在搞综合利用后，生产出的许多产品并非本厂所需要，而且往往一种下脚料，既可以生产甲种产品，也可以提炼乙种产品，因为这些工厂对工业生产中最迫切需要的品种不了解，所以经常发生市场上需要甲种产品，而工厂却生产乙种产品的现象。同时，还有一些工厂因受设备、人力、财力的限制，对下脚废料还没有能够充分利用起来。
    针对这种情况，这个站的党组织决定进一步发挥商业部门的作用，在各区区委的统一领导下，组织有条件的工厂建立综合利用“一条龙协作网”，充分利用现有废弃物资，生产市场上迫切需要的化工原料。近两个月来，已组织了一百七十四个工厂，分别和油漆颜料总工厂、人民制药厂等二十三个大工厂，建立起固定的协作关系。目前，这一工作仍在积极进行，决定通过这种作法，力争到年底组织生产化工原料两万吨。
      “一条龙协作网”的形式，有厂厂协作和厂社协作。在厂厂协作中，有些是：这一个工厂利用另一个工厂的废料，加工生产工业原料；有些是：这一个厂的废料，就是另一个工厂的生产原料，被取去直接用于生产。厂社协作，全部是公社工业根据大工业的废料资源，建立或发展起来的化工厂，成为大工厂综合利用的卫星厂或车间。
    建立综合利用一条龙协作，具有上马快、收效大的特点，适应了当前工业生产高速度发展对原材料的需要。在上半年已经生产出的九十七种化工原料中，过去长期依靠外地供应的油酸，氯仿、丁脂等三十二个品种已经达到自给，并且还生产出一向依赖进口的红矾钠、塑料增塑剂等四种高级产品。
