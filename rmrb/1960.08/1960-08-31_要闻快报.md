　　Save Ore to Produce More Steel
　　The open-hearth furnace ore used by Anshan Iron and Steel Company is mostly transported from afar. In order to rationally utilize national resources and save transportation capacity, Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steel plants have launched a mass movement to conserve ore usage. Currently, the consumption quota of open-hearth furnace ore per ton of steel has been reduced by 28 kilograms compared to the plan. In the first half of this year, a total of more than 90,000 tons of open-hearth furnace ore was saved for the country.

　　Helping Small Converters Overcome Technical Hurdles
　　Since the second quarter of this year, a number of small converters have been newly built in Taiyuan industrial and mining enterprises and have been put into production one after another. In order to help these small converters quickly overcome technical hurdles, relevant leading departments in Taiyuan City recently invited experienced workers from advanced small converter units to impart technology, conduct technical consultations, and solve many key technical problems, enabling these newly built small converters to quickly overcome technical hurdles, achieve normal production, and generally improve the quality of steel ingots. The qualified rate of first and second-grade products generally remains at around 70 to 80 percent.

　　Helping Steel Plants Repair Equipment
　　Leading cadres, technicians, and workers from various machinery factories in Hangzhou City went to various steel plants to investigate the operation of metallurgical equipment and help with machine maintenance and repair work. They adopted methods such as listening to introductions, conducting on-site inspections, holding forums to study measures to strengthen machine equipment maintenance, and determining repair items, clarifying the spare parts and accessories needed for equipment repair and finding out the causes of equipment wear. Currently, all machinery factories in Hangzhou City are rushing to manufacture spare parts and accessories for steel plant equipment repair.

　　Door-to-Door Service for Repairs and Replacements
　　Fuxin Mining Bureau's Central Machinery Repair Plant has adopted the method of "door-to-door service, on-site repair and replacement" to support the high-volume increase in coal production. The plant has established six machine and electrical equipment repair shock teams, including vehicle, fitter, riveter, forging, welding, and transportation trades. In addition to one team staying in the factory to rush to manufacture spare parts, the other five teams, carrying a large number of spare parts, went deep into coal mines such as Xinqiu, Ping'an, and Qinghemen to repair equipment. They spent only seven days repairing one hundred iron coal cars, which used to take two months to complete, ensuring the transportation needs for high coal production.

　　Ensuring Ample Steel Plant Inventory
　　Tianjin Automobile Transportation Fourth Yard, based on the principle of ensuring key needs and taking care of general needs, dispatched a large number of vehicles to be stationed at steel plants and refractory material plants, specifically responsible for transporting iron and steel materials. At the same time, it also dispatched a dispatching team leader and six on-site dispatchers to be stationed at the steel plant to promptly grasp the source and quantity of iron and steel materials. In dispatching operations, it adopted the method of "using heavy to carry light" and "using light to match heavy," giving full play to the transportation efficiency of automobiles, not only ensuring that the steel plant had sufficient inventory materials, but also taking care of the transportation needs of general materials.

    要闻快报
    节约矿石多炼钢
    鞍山钢铁公司使用的平炉矿石，大部分是从远道调来的。为了合理利用国家资源和节约运输力量，鞍钢各钢厂掀起了一个节约使用矿石的群众运动。目前每吨钢平炉矿的消耗定额已比计划降低二十八公斤，今年上半年共为国家节约九万多吨平炉矿石。
    帮助小转炉突破技术关
    今年第二季度以来，太原市工矿企业新建成一批小转炉，并已陆续投入生产。为了帮助这批小转炉迅速突破技术关，最近太原市有关领导部门邀请了小转炉先进单位有经验的工人传授技术，进行技术医疗，解决了不少技术关键问题；使这批新建的小转炉迅速跨过了技术关，作到正常生产，普遍提高了钢锭的质量，一二级品的合格率，一般都保持在百分之七十到八十左右。
    帮助钢铁厂检修设备
    杭州市各机械厂领导干部、技术人员和工人，到各钢铁厂调查研究冶金设备运转情况，帮助做好机器维护检修工作。他们采取听介绍情况、实地查看、开座谈会研究加强机器设备维修措施、确定检修项目等办法，摸清了检修设备所需要的备品、配件，找出了设备磨损的原因。目前杭州市所有机械厂，正在为钢铁厂突击制造检修设备的备品、配件。
    服务到户修配上门
    阜新矿务局中央机修厂采用“服务到户，修配上门”的办法，支援煤炭高额增产。这个厂成立了六个包括车、钳、铆、锻、焊、运输等工种的机电设备检修突击队；除开一个队留在工厂突击制造配件以外，其他五个队携带着大批配件分别深入新丘、平安、清河门等煤矿，检修设备。他们仅用七天的时间，就修完了过去需要两个月才能修完的一百台铁煤车，保证了煤炭高产的运输需要。
    保证钢厂库存充裕
    天津市汽车运输四场，根据保证重点，照顾一般的原则，派出大批汽车驻在钢厂和耐火材料厂，专门负责运送钢铁物资。与此同时，还调派了一个调度组长和六个现场调度人员，驻在钢厂，及时掌握钢铁物资的货源、数量。在调度作业上，采取了“以重带轻”、“以轻配重”的办法，充分地发挥了汽车的运输效能，不但保证了钢厂有足够的库存物资，也照顾到了一般物资的运输需要。
