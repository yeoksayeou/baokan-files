(Our Correspondent in Xi'an, August 8) Hancheng County, Shaanxi Province, has extensively mobilized the masses from top to bottom to summarize the experience of this year's wheat harvest under long-term drought conditions. By summarizing experience, the confidence of the people of the county in striving for a bumper wheat harvest next year has been further boosted. At present, the people of the county are using these experiences of bumper harvests as a guide, carrying out autumn planting preparation work centered on "three fulls" (full deep plowing, full application of base fertilizer, and full mechanized sowing) and "three increases" (expanding planting area, expanding high-yield fields, and reasonably increasing seeding rate).

Hancheng County is a region with relatively poor natural conditions in Guanzhong. Its terrain is mostly high loess plateaus and gullies, with more dry land and less irrigated land. Following last year's hundred-day severe drought, Hancheng County experienced another seven consecutive months without substantial rain, causing more than 900,000 mu of wheat in the county to suffer from a drought unprecedented in history. However, the people of the county, with the ambition of "great overproduction with rain, guaranteed harvest without rain," launched a struggle against the drought and finally achieved a bumper harvest. There were more than 310,000 mu of high-yield fields with an average yield of over 350 jin per mu in the county.

This year, starting from the summer harvest, Hancheng County dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into the fields, on the one hand to lead the summer harvest work, and on the other hand to widely carry out a mass movement to summarize the experience of bumper wheat harvests. In early May, the county established a Wheat High-Yield Experience Research Office to specifically investigate and study this year's wheat high-yield experience. The County Agricultural Science Institute, the County Party Committee Office, and the County Science Committee formed an experience summary working group, with a total of more than 130 cadres, led by six secretaries and five county heads, who went deep into the fields and commune members' homes in the county's eleven communes to investigate the experience of this year's wheat harvest under long-term drought conditions. Each commune and production team also established ninety experience summary groups, with more than 1,000 people including wheat high-yield experts, scientific and technical cadres, and experienced farmers participating. They adopted a method combining leading cadres, technical personnel, and the masses, with everyone providing information and everyone participating in discussions, and organized the masses to visit and compare wheat fields to summarize the experience of high-yield wheat. According to incomplete statistics, the county, commune, and production team levels alone organized more than 20,000 commune members to conduct discussions and seminars, and a total of more than 420 typical experiences of high-yield wheat were summarized. These experiences included those from high-yield fields, general fields, irrigated land, and dry land, covering all aspects such as deep plowing, close planting, fertilization, and wheat field management. In order to deepen the masses' understanding of this year's wheat high-yield experience, based on the summarized wheat high-yield experience, the relevant departments of the county held a wheat high-yield exhibition, and each commune also held a small exhibition, organizing the masses to visit and learn.

On the basis of summarizing experience, Hancheng County convened a wheat high-yield experience exchange meeting attended by more than 400 people in July. At the meeting, based on the characteristics of the county, several key wheat high-yield experiences were affirmed, and this year's autumn planting plan was formulated under the guidance of these experiences. At present, the county has universally launched an autumn planting preparation work movement centered on "three fulls" and "three increases."

When formulating the wheat plan, Hancheng County decided to proceed from the idea of long-term drought resistance, continuing to expand the wheat planting area and expand the area of high-yield fields. Hancheng is a drought-prone area, and wheat is a drought-resistant crop. Moreover, since droughts have occurred mostly after the wheat harvest in previous years, expanding the wheat planting area and extensively planting high-yield fields is a permanent measure to resist drought. Hancheng County has decided to expand the wheat planting area by 50,000 mu this year compared to last year; it plans to cultivate high-yield fields accounting for 70% of the total planting area, an increase of 25% over last year. At present, the autumn planting plan and the high-yield field plan have all been implemented in production teams.

In the autumn planting preparation work, Hancheng has focused on deep plowing. This is not only a key measure for increasing wheat production, but also a drought resistance measure. Last year, 90% of Hancheng County's wheat fields were deep plowed to more than six inches, of which more than 230,000 mu were deep plowed to more than eight inches, more than doubling the number of mu deep plowed compared to the previous year. Under this year's drought conditions, wheat fields that had been deep plowed did not experience wilting; while shallow plowed wheat fields experienced yellowing and premature drying, affecting the normal development and yield of the wheat seedlings. This year, having accepted this experience, the county launched a deep plowing campaign early. To date, more than 380,000 mu have been deep plowed, accounting for 60% of the autumn fallow land area, and the deep plowing progress is 10% to 20% faster than the same period last year. Many deep plowed lands have been deep plowed to about one chi (foot).

Hancheng County proposed that all base fertilizer should be applied this year, and the amount of base fertilizer should be increased. Hancheng County launched a widespread manure accumulation and base fertilizer application campaign in July. To date, the county has accumulated 20 billion jin of fertilizer, exceeding the original plan by 5 billion jin; the fertilization area has reached 240,000 mu, and generally each mu has reached 5,000 jin to 10,000 jin or more, an increase of about 15% in the amount of base fertilizer applied compared to the same period last year. According to this year's wheat high-yield experience in the county, applying more base fertilizer is conducive to increasing wheat production under long-term drought conditions. According to a survey by various communes, there is a big difference in yield between wheat fields with and without base fertilizer, and between wheat fields with more and less base fertilizer. The Xiangfeng Production Team of the Chengjiao Commune has three wheat fields with the same other conditions. The wheat field that applied 5,000 jin of base fertilizer increased production by 15% compared to the one that did not apply base fertilizer; the one that applied 10,000 jin of base fertilizer increased production by 32.3% compared to the one that did not apply base fertilizer; and the one that applied 20,000 jin of base fertilizer increased production by 45.1% compared to the one that did not apply base fertilizer. Hancheng County also plans to continue to appropriately increase the wheat seeding rate this year. According to a survey by the county, the wheat germination rate is 5% lower under drought conditions than when rainfall is normal, and tillering is about 10% less. Appropriately increasing the seeding rate can ensure full and vigorous seedlings and strive for a bumper harvest.

    深入发动群众总结夏收经验做好秋播准备
    韩城小麦秋播计划落实到队
    扩大播种和丰产田面积，深翻地和积肥、施底肥运动广泛展开
    本报西安8日电　陕西省韩城县广泛地发动群众，自上而下地总结今年小麦在长期干旱情况下获得丰产的经验。通过总结经验，更鼓舞了全县人民争取明年小麦丰产的信心。目前，全县人民正在以这些丰产经验为指导，开展了三全（全深翻、全施底肥、全部机播），三大（扩大播种面积、扩大丰产田、合理加大种量）为中心的秋播准备工作。
    韩城县是关中自然条件较差的地区，境内多是高塬沟壑区，旱地多、水地少。韩城县继去年百日大旱以来，又连续七个月未降透雨，使全县九十多万亩小麦遭受了历史上罕见的旱灾。但是，全县人民以“有雨大超产，无雨保丰收”的雄心壮志，向干旱展开了斗争，终于获得了丰收。全县出现平均亩产三百五十斤以上的丰产田就有三十一万多亩。
    韩城县今年从夏收开始，就派出大批干部，深入田间，一面领导夏收工作，一面广泛地开展了群众性的总结小麦丰产经验运动。5月初，这个县成立了小麦丰产经验研究室，专门调查研究今年的小麦丰产经验。县农业科学研究所、县委办公室、县科学委员会组成了总结经验工作组，共一百三十多名干部，由六个书记、五个县长率领，分别到全县十一个公社深入田间和社员家庭，调查今年小麦在长期干旱的情况下获得丰产的经验。各公社和生产队也建立了由小麦丰产能手、科学技术干部、老农等一千多人参加的九十个总结经验小组，采取领导干部、技术人员和群众相结合的办法，人人提供资料，人人参加讨论，并组织群众到麦田里参观对比，总结小麦丰产的经验。据不完全统计，仅县、公社和生产队三级就组织了二万多名社员进行讨论座谈，先后共总结出四百二十多份小麦丰产的典型经验。这些经验，有丰产田的，也有一般田的，有水地的，也有旱地的，包括深翻、密植、施肥、麦田管理等各个方面。为了加深群众对今年小麦丰产经验的认识，根据总结出来的小麦丰产经验，县各有关部门举办了小麦丰产展览会，各公社也举办了小型展览会，组织群众参观学习。
    在总结经验的基础上，韩城县在7月召开了四百多人参加的小麦丰产经验交流会议。会上根据本县的特点，肯定了几项带有关键性的小麦丰产经验，并以这些经验为指导，制订出今年秋播计划。目前，全县已经普遍地开展了以“三全”、“三大”为中心的秋播准备工作运动。
    韩城县在制定小麦计划时，确定从长期抗旱这一思想出发，继续扩大小麦播种面积，扩大丰产田的面积。韩城是干旱地区，而小麦是耐旱作物，并且，历年来旱灾多发生在小麦收获期后，扩大小麦播种面积，大种丰产田，是抗旱的一项永久性的措施。韩城县已决定今年小麦播种面积比去年扩大五万亩；计划培育丰产田占总播种面积的70％，比去年扩大25％。目前秋播计划和丰产田的计划，已经全部落实到生产小队。
    在秋播准备工作中，韩城大抓深翻地的工作。这既是小麦增产的一项关键性措施，又是一项抗旱措施。去年韩城县90％的麦田深翻在六寸以上，其中深翻八寸以上的有二十三万多亩，深翻亩数比前年增加一倍以上。在今年干旱的情况下，经过深翻的麦田，麦苗没有发生干枯现象；而浅翻的麦田，则麦苗发生枯黄和青干现象，影响麦苗的正常发育和产量。今年，接受了这一经验，全县及早开展了深翻地运动。到目前为止，已深翻三十八万多亩，占秋闲地面积的60％，深翻地进度比去年同期快了10％到20％。有很多深翻地，深翻在一尺左右。
    韩城县提出今年要全部施底肥，并且要加大底肥量。韩城县在7月份广泛地开展了一个积肥、施底肥运动。到目前为止，全县已积肥二百亿斤，超过原计划五十亿斤；施肥面积已达二十四万亩，一般每亩都达五千斤到万斤以上，比去年同期施底肥量增加15％左右。根据这个县今年小麦丰产的经验，在长期干旱的情况下，多施底肥有利小麦增产。据各公社的调查，施底肥与不施底肥，底肥多和底肥少的麦田，其产量都有很大的差别。城郊公社象峰生产队有三块麦田，其它条件相同，而施五千斤底肥的麦田比没施底肥的增产15％；施一万斤底肥的比没施底肥的增产32.3％；施二万斤底肥的比没施底肥的增产45.1％。韩城县还计划今年继续适当加大小麦播种量，据这个县调查，在干旱情况下小麦发芽率比在雨水正常时低5％，分蘖少10％左右。适当增加播种量，可以保证苗全苗旺，争取丰收。
