Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 4th: Our reporter reports: With the care and strong support of the state and industrial sectors, agricultural mechanization in northern Korea has developed rapidly this year. More than 10,000 tractors will be running in the fields of northern Korea this year. Agricultural mechanization, long awaited by Korean farmers, can be basically realized in three to four years.

In order to further accelerate agricultural development and implement the technological revolution in agriculture, the Korean Workers' Party has designated agricultural mechanization as the central task for this year, and stipulated that agricultural mechanization should be basically realized in the next three to four years. The mechanical industry and local industrial sectors in Korea have produced a large number of tractors, trucks, and various agricultural machines and tools for the countryside. In the first half of this year alone, the state supplied the countryside with more than 1,600 tractors and trucks, more than 5,000 tractor and truck trailers, more than 77,000 seeders and grass cutters, and a large number of electric motors, transformers, crushers, etc.

In addition, in order to improve the utilization rate and cultivation quality of tractors and various agricultural machines, Korea reorganized the original tractor cultivation stations into agricultural machinery operation stations at the end of last year. The employees of the operation stations not only undertake farming, but also participate in transportation, middle tilling and other operations, and must ensure the quality of cultivation and jointly be responsible with the agricultural cooperatives for the quality of crops on the cultivated land.

Due to the large increase in agricultural machinery and the reorganization of agricultural machinery operation stations, the mechanized operation volume of agricultural machinery operation stations in the first half of this year reached 2.6 times that of the first half of last year, and the total mechanized cultivation area reached more than 2.38 million chongbo (approximately 15 mu per chongbo), an increase of more than 135,000 chongbo compared with the first half of last year. Plain areas such as South Pyongan Province and South Hwanghae Province have basically achieved complete mechanized cultivation. In the first half of this year, agricultural machinery operation stations also helped agricultural cooperatives transport fertilizers to the fields and carry out other transportation work, with a total transportation volume increasing by approximately seven times compared with the same period last year.

Before liberation, there were no tractors at all in the rural areas of northern Korea. Plowing with cattle was considered the best, and poor farmers even used people to pull plows.

After liberation, there has been a leap-forward development. By the end of last year, there were already 8,000 standard tractors in rural areas of northern Korea. Now, South Pyongan Province alone has 19 agricultural machinery operation stations, with a total of more than 2,300 standard tractors.

The newly emerging mechanical industry sector since liberation has vigorously supported agricultural mechanization this year. The Kiyang Machinery Factory and Tokchon Automobile Factory, which successfully trial-produced tractors and trucks in the winter of 1958, have begun mass production this year after strengthening technical equipment and cooperating with other machinery factories. This spring, a large number of "Chollima" brand tractors and "Victory 58" trucks manufactured in Korea participated in spring plowing and fertilizer transportation, and were warmly welcomed by farmers. Recently, the workers of the Kanggye Textile Machinery Manufacturing Factory successfully trial-produced a small 5-horsepower tractor suitable for mountain farming, which has created more favorable conditions for realizing mechanization in mountainous areas. The thirteen provincial-run comprehensive machinery factories and agricultural machinery factories in each county, which were newly built with the support of the mechanical industry sector last year, have produced a large number of agricultural machines and tools for the countryside.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 4th: Workers in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, are actively supporting agricultural production cooperatives, setting an example in the national movement to support agricultural collectivization.

Five hundred and fifty-four party organizations in factories, enterprises, and government offices in Budapest have established regular contacts with eight hundred and nineteen agricultural production cooperatives throughout the country. Members of these party organizations often participate in meetings of cooperative party organizations, introduce the party's work experience and working methods, and have played a significant role in the establishment and consolidation of rural party organizations.

Workers from all walks of life in the capital have extensively launched voluntary labor to help cooperatives in their construction. An average of two batches of workers from each cooperative they are in contact with come to participate in voluntary labor every month. The workers of the Telecommunications Equipment Factory and the Kobanya Ceramics Factory built large-scale livestock sheds for cooperatives in Szolnok County and Veszprém County, respectively. While working, the workers in Budapest also vigorously cultivate cadres for the cooperatives.

Financial and economic cadres from various factories often go to the countryside to help cooperatives formulate financial plans and piece-rate systems, etc. Many experts have also organized professional teams to go deep into the countryside to serve the peasants. Medical workers go to various villages to perform "X-ray" fluoroscopies for farmers. Residents of the capital have also contributed a lot to helping rural areas carry out cultural activities.

During the summer harvest, the residents of the capital were even more enthusiastic in their support. Tens of thousands of workers, government cadres, students, etc. used their rest time to go to the countryside to help farmers with the harvest.

The central and local industries of Korea are all mobilized to produce tractors, trucks, and various agricultural machines to support agricultural mechanization. The picture shows a large number of trucks produced by the Tokchon Automobile Factory in South Pyongan Province. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在国家和工业部门的大力支援下
    朝鲜北部农村加速推进农业机械化
    匈牙利首都职工采取多种措施支援农业生产合作社
    新华社平壤4日电　本社记者报道：在国家和工业部门的关怀和大力支援下，朝鲜北部的农业机械化今年以来得到了迅速的发展。在今年内，将有一万台以上的拖拉机奔跑在朝鲜北部的田野上，三、四年内，朝鲜农民长期盼望的农业机械化即可基本实现。
    为了进一步加速农业的发展和实行农业的技术革命，朝鲜劳动党把农业机械化规定为今年的中心任务，并规定在今后三、四年内基本实现农业机械化。朝鲜的机械工业和地方工业部门已经为农村生产了大批拖拉机、载重汽车以及各种农业机械和农具。仅今年上半年，国家供应给农村的就有一千六百多台拖拉机和载重汽车，五千多辆拖拉机和载重汽车用的拖车，七万七千多台播种机和切草机以及大量的电动机、变压器、粉碎机等。
    另外，为了提高拖拉机和各种农业机械的利用率和耕作的质量，朝鲜在去年年底把原来的拖拉机代耕站改组为农业机械作业所。作业所的职工不仅担任耕田，还参加运输、中耕等作业，并且要保证耕作质量，同农业社共同对所耕作的土地上的农作物的好坏负责。
    由于农业机械的大量增加和改组了农业机械作业所，今年上半年农业机械作业所的机械化作业量达到了去年上半年的二点六倍，机械耕作总面积达到二百三十八万多町步（每町步约合十五亩），比去年上半年增加了十三万五千多町步。平安南道、黄海南道等平原地带已经基本上全部实现了机耕。今年上半年农业机械作业所还帮助农业社往田地里运送肥料以及进行其他运输工作，总运输量比去年同期增加了约七倍。
    在解放以前，朝鲜北部的农村根本没有拖拉机，用牛耕田算是最好了，贫苦的农民甚至用人拉犁。
    解放后，有了飞跃的发展。到去年年底，朝鲜北部农村中就已经有八千标准台拖拉机。现在，仅平安南道一个道就有十九个农业机械作业所，共有二千三百多标准台拖拉机。
    解放后新兴的机械工业部门，今年以来大力支援农业机械化。在1958年冬天试制拖拉机和载重汽车成功的歧阳机械厂和德川汽车厂，经过加强技术装备并同其他机械厂实行协作后，今年开始大量生产。今年春天，朝鲜制造的大批“千里马”牌拖拉机和“胜利五十八型”载重汽车参加了春耕和运送肥料，受到农民们的热烈欢迎。最近，江界纺织机械制造厂的职工试制成功了一种五马力的适合于山区耕作的小型拖拉机，这为实现山区的机械化创造了更有利的条件。去年在机械工业部门支援下新建的十三个道营综合机械厂和每个郡的农业机械厂都为农村生产了大量的农业机械和农具。
    新华社布达佩斯4日电　匈牙利首都布达佩斯的职工积极支援农业生产合作社，在全民支援农业合作化的运动中作出了榜样。
    布达佩斯各工厂企业和机关的五百五十四个党组织已经同遍及全国的八百一十九个农业生产合作社建立了经常性的联系。这些党组织的成员经常参加合作社党组织的会议，介绍党的工作经验和工作方法，对农村党组织的建立和巩固起了很大的作用。
    首都各行各业的工作人员广泛地展开了帮助合作社进行建设的义务劳动。他们所联系的每个合作社，平均每月都有两批职工来参加义务劳动。电讯器材厂和戈巴尼陶瓷厂的职工就分别为索尔诺克州和维斯普雷姆州的合作社建筑了大型畜舍。在劳动的同时，布达佩斯的职工还为合作社大力培养干部。
    各工厂的财经干部经常下乡帮助合作社制订财务计划和评工计分的制度等。许多专家们也组织了专业小组，深入农村，为农民服务。医务工作者则到各村去为农民作“X光”透视。在帮助农村开展文化活动方面，首都居民也出了不少力。
    夏收期间，首都居民更是热情支援。成千上万的工人、机关干部、学生等利用休息时间，下乡帮助农民抢收。
    朝鲜的中央工业和地方工业都一致动员起来，生产拖拉机、载重汽车和各种农业机械来支援农业机械化。图为平安南道德川汽车工厂生产的大批载重汽车　（新华社发）
