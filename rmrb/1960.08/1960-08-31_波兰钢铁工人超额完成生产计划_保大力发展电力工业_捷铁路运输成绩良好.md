Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 30th: Poland's steel production this year will increase to 6.57 million tons, which is more than 4.4 times the production in 1937 before liberation.

Since the beginning of this year, Polish steelworkers have victoriously completed their production tasks. As of the end of July, they had overproduced approximately 87,000 tons of steel. In the first half of the year, workers produced 200,000 tons more steel than in the same period last year.

In order to ensure the continuous increase of steel production, Poland is further expanding its key domestic steel factories. For example, the nation's largest Lenin Metallurgical Combine (in Nowa Huta), built ten years ago, will have two new rolling workshops, a steel pipe plant, and the No. 9 open-hearth furnace put into production this year. It will produce approximately 1.5 million tons of steel this year; after expansion during the next Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), it will be able to produce 3.3 million tons of steel. The Warsaw Quality Steel Plant will put two open-hearth furnaces and a steel ingot workshop into production this year, and its production capacity will increase to 300,000 tons this year.

While expanding steel plants, measures are also being taken in various places to improve the technical equipment of old metallurgical factories. The work of developing open-hearth furnace automation is being strengthened. It is expected that by 1965, at least 40% of steelmaking furnaces will be equipped with automatic devices.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, August 20th: Bulgaria's electricity generation in the first half of this year has reached 2,141 million kilowatt-hours, which is equivalent to eight times Bulgaria's total electricity generation in 1939. The planned increase in electricity generation this year alone is one and a half times more than the total electricity generation in 1939 (266 million kilowatt-hours). It now takes only 21 days to produce the total annual electricity generation of 1939.

Bulgaria's electric power industry continues to develop. This year's investment in electric power construction is more than 669 million leva, which is equivalent to about one-sixth of the total industrial investment. This year, 189,000 kilowatts of new generating capacity will be put into production, including 106,000 kilowatts of thermal power and 83,000 kilowatts of hydropower. By 1965, Bulgaria's total electricity production is expected to reach 16 billion kilowatt-hours.

Before the liberation in September 1944, Bulgaria's electricity production per capita was at the bottom of European countries, while in 1959, its electricity generation per capita reached 496 kilowatt-hours, equivalent to twice that of Greece and three times that of Turkey.

Bulgaria established a series of power stations as early as the First Five-Year Plan period. The "Stalin," "Maritsa Three," and "Republic" power stations, after expansion, became the basic pillars of national electrification. As early as 1958, more than 3,700 rural areas across the country had achieved electrification.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 25th: Czechoslovakia's railway transportation industry achieved good results in the first half of the year. The volume of freight transported by rail increased by approximately 8% compared to the same period last year, and the volume of passenger transport increased by approximately 5%.

Railway employees extensively launched socialist labor competitions in the first half of the year. More than 3,000 collectives participated in the competition to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team" alone.

Due to the high enthusiasm of railway employees, the average load-carrying capacity of freight cars increased by 15 tons compared to the same period last year, reaching 1,357 tons in the first half of this year. In the second quarter of this year, 73,500 fully loaded trains transported an excess of 22.25 million tons of cargo.

Passenger transport work has also been greatly improved this year. The driving speed has increased by an average of 8% to 11% compared to last year.

Currently, 25% of Czechoslovakia's railway transportation is electrified, compared to only 14% in the first half of last year.

    波兰钢铁工人超额完成生产计划
    保大力发展电力工业　捷铁路运输成绩良好
    据新华社华沙30日电　今年波兰的钢产量将增加到六百五十七万吨，这将相当于解放前1937年产量的四点四倍以上。
    今年以来，波兰钢铁工人胜利地完成了生产任务。截至7月底为止，他们已经超计划生产了约八万七千吨钢。在上半年，工人们生产的钢比去年同期多二十万吨。
    为了保证钢铁生产不断增加，波兰正在进一步扩建国内的重点钢铁工厂。例如，十年前兴建起来的全国最大的列宁冶金联合企业（在诺瓦胡塔），今年将有两个新的轧钢车间、一座钢管厂和第九号平炉投入生产。它今年将生产约一百五十万吨钢；经过下一个五年计划
  （1961—1965年）扩建后，它将可以生产三百三十万吨钢。华沙优质钢厂今年投入生产的将有两个平炉和一个钢锭车间，它的生产能力今年就可以提高到三十万吨。
    和扩建钢铁厂同时，各地还在采取措施，改进旧冶金工厂的技术设备。发展平炉自动化的工作正在加强。预计到1965年时，至少有40％炼钢炉将安装有自动装置。
    新华社索非亚20日电　保加利亚今年上半年发电量已达二十一亿四千一百万度，这相当于1939年保加利亚全年发电量的八倍。仅今年计划增长的发电量就比1939年全年发电量（二亿六千六百万度）还要多一倍半。1939年的全年发电量现在只需要二十一天就可以生产出来了。
    保加利亚的电力工业还在继续发展。今年电力建设方面的投资为六亿六千九百多万列弗，约相当全部工业投资总额的六分之一。今年将有十八万九千瓩新建的发电能力投入生产，其中有火力发电十万零六千瓩、水力发电八万三千瓩。到1965年，保加利亚全国的电力生产预定将达到一百六十亿度。
    保加利亚电力生产在1944年9月解放前按人口平均计算处于欧洲国家的末位，而在1959年其发电量按人口平均计算已达四百九十六度，相当于希腊的两倍和土耳其的三倍。
    保加利亚早在第一个五年计划期间就建立了一系列的发电站。“斯大林”、“马里查三号”和“共和国”等电站在扩建以后，变成了国家电气化的基本支柱。早在1958年，全国就有三千七百多个农村实现了电气化。
    新华社布拉格25日电　捷克斯洛伐克铁路运输业在上半年中取得了良好的成绩。铁路的货运量比去年同时期增加了约8％，客运量增加了5％左右。
    铁路员工在上半年广泛地展开了社会主义劳动竞赛，单是参加争取“社会主义劳动队”称号竞赛的集体就达三千个以上。
    由于铁路员工的劳动热情高涨，在今年上半年中，货车平均载运量比去年同时期增加了十五吨，而达到一千三百五十七吨。在今年第二季度中，七万三千五百满载列车超额运输了二千二百五十万吨货物。
    今年客运工作也大大改进了。行车速度比去年平均提高了8％到11％。
    目前，捷克斯洛伐克的铁路运输已有25％电气化，而在去年上半年只有14％电气化。
