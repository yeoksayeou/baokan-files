How to Accelerate Mine Construction
Wang Lizhi, First Secretary of the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Henan Province

To prepare sufficient food—ore—for the small blast furnaces is a crucial key to ensuring the sustained high production of steel. After technical upgrades, the small blast furnaces in Zhengzhou City consume large amounts of ore day and night. In the first seven months of this year, the city's steel production increased 36 times compared to the same period last year, and iron production increased 1.5 times. The rapid increase in the smelting capacity of small blast furnaces requires us to concentrate our superior forces to strengthen mine construction. Recently, I went to the suburban mines to study how to accelerate the development of the mining industry, and I have the following experiences.

Investigating mineral deposits, making overall plans, and accelerating the technical transformation of mines are the urgent tasks for strengthening mine production and construction. Only by clarifying mineral deposits and making overall plans can we grasp the key points and concentrate our efforts to accelerate the transformation of mines. After repeated research and comparison, we determined that two mines with relatively clear resources, easy to mine, and relatively convenient transportation should be the focus of technical transformation. Starting with the investigation of mineral deposits, we studied mining layout, site design, technical transformation, on-site and off-site transportation, labor organization, management systems, and other issues, and formulated comprehensive transformation plans and measures to implement the plans in stages and batches. At the same time, we adopted the method of grasping both the front and the rear. The city formed a rear-service command to support the mines, led by the municipal party secretary, organizing factories, enterprises, government agencies, schools, and other industries to support mine construction in every possible way.

Combining national mining with commune mining is a good way to increase ore production. On the one hand, the state should build mining bases; on the other hand, communes should be organized to prospect, mine, and transport ore under the premise of not hindering agriculture. "Ten thousand stars converge into the Milky Way"—this is a remarkable force! We saw a batch of commune-run mines that required no state investment and no state equipment. They made their own simple machines and mined the ore. They mine less during the busy farming season and more during the slack season. One such small mine produces hundreds of tons per day, with the lower end producing hundreds of tons. Obviously, the one-sided view that only "felling a big tree provides firewood" and ignores "many people gathering firewood makes a big flame" is wrong. In order to support the commune-run mining industry, we have, according to the plan, organized commune-run mines to be paired with steel mills to promote and support each other.

Correctly handle the relationship between tunneling, stripping, and mining, and correctly resolve the contradiction between capital construction and production. From what we have learned, mine leaders generally focused on production and neglected capital construction; they focused on mining and neglected stripping. After correcting these biases, some may experience the phenomenon of only engaging in capital construction and neglecting current production. Therefore, properly combining capital construction with current production is an important issue in current mine construction. We should grasp both capital construction and production: construction here, production there; construction of new wells and new sites, continued production in old wells and old sites; alternating transformation and alternating production.

In order to accelerate mine construction, we must mobilize the masses to carry out a major technical revolution in both capital construction and production. According to different characteristics, adapt to local conditions, use indigenous methods, and rely on our own efforts. Sitting and waiting for support and relying on handouts is a lazy man's thinking. We have seen several specific examples that we believe are worth learning from other units. One is the chute of the Zhoushan Coal Mine. The coking coal produced by this mine is relatively good, but it cannot be transported out in a mountain depression. What should they do? They did not bow to the difficulties, but mobilized the masses to use the steep slopes of the mountains, dug several chutes, and laid broken pottery pieces. A large amount of coal slid out in this way. One is the small indigenous ore separator at the Jingwan Iron Mine. Iron ore can be turned into rich ore through magnetic separation. However, waiting for foreign equipment is a drop in the bucket. They adopted the "three-way combination" method, worked hard to study and develop, and trial-produced an indigenous ore separator. Now, they are designing and manufacturing larger indigenous ore separators in order to produce more and faster concentrate. At present, our "small indigenous groups" of mines are both poor and blank, with manual operation and heavy labor. Precisely because of this, the potential is great. The masses are also eager to carry out a technical revolution. Combining the self-reliance of the mining site itself to carry out a technical revolution with the active support of the city can accelerate mine construction.

Resolutely not allowing low-grade ore to be transported down the mountain is an important issue in mine production. In the ore layers of some small mines, the iron content varies. In some "chicken coop mines," the iron ore is mixed with stones, clay, and other miscellaneous things. If these things are transported down the mountain together with the ore, it will be a considerable waste from transportation to smelting. In order to resolutely prevent low-grade ore from being transported down the mountain and ensure that small blast furnaces eat fine grain, we discussed with workers and cadres and adopted several effective measures: using accounting comparison methods, we repeatedly conducted ideological education for mine workers to improve the quality of ore, so that they understand the waste caused by low-grade ore being transported down the mountain in transportation and smelting, and consciously improve the quality of ore; implement layered mining of ore, graded stacking, and graded transportation to achieve "pricing according to quality"; establish a strict quality inspection system from the metallurgical leadership department to the mining site, work area, and underground; consolidate ore dressing within the mining site as a process, and ore dressing must be carried out both in the well and on the site to ensure that ore with an iron content of less than 40% is not transported down the mountain.

    怎样加速矿山建设
    中共河南省郑州市委第一书记　王黎之
    为炼铁小高炉准备充足的粮食——矿石，是保证钢铁持续高产的重要关键。郑州市的炼铁小高炉经过技术改造以后，日夜吞食着大量的矿石。今年头七个月，全市钢产量比去年同期增长三十六倍，铁产量增长一点五倍。小高炉冶炼能力的迅速提高，要求我们集中优势力量，加强矿山建设。最近，我到郊区矿山研究了一下如何加速发展采掘工业的问题，有如下体会。
    查清矿藏，通盘规划，加速矿山技术改造，是加强矿山生产建设的当务之急。查清矿藏，通盘规划，才能抓好重点，集中力量加速矿山的改造。我们经过反复研究比较，确定了两个资源比较清楚、易于开采、运输比较方便的矿作为技术改造重点。从查清矿藏入手，我们研究了开采布局，场区设计，技术改造，场内外运输，劳动组织，管理制度等问题，制订了全面的改造规划和分期、分批实现规划的措施。同时，采取了前方后方一齐抓的办法。市内组成了支援矿山后勤指挥部，由市委书记挂帅，组织工厂、企业、机关、学校等各行各业，千方百计支援矿山建设。
    国家开采和公社开采相结合，是增产矿石的好办法。一方面，要国家办，建设采矿基地；另一方面，还要在不妨害农业的前提下组织公社办，发动广大群众查矿，挖矿，运矿。“万点星斗汇银河”，这是一个了不起的力量！我们看到的一批社办采矿场，一不要国家投资，二不要国家出设备，自制简易机具，就把矿石开采出来了。农忙时少采，农闲时多采。一个这样的小型采矿场，日产量少者百吨，多者数百吨。显然，那种只认为“砍倒大树有柴烧”，忽视“众人拾柴火焰高”的片面观点是错误的。为了支援社办采矿工业，我们已经根据规划，组织社办采矿场同钢铁厂对口挂钩，互相促进，互相支援。
    正确处理掘进、剥离和开采的关系，正确解决基本建设和生产的矛盾。从我们了解的情况看，矿山领导干部开始一般是重生产，轻基本建设；重开采，轻剥离。纠正这些偏向以后，有的又会出现只搞基本建设，忽视当前生产的现象。因此，妥善地把基本建设同当前生产结合起来，是当前矿山建设中一个重要问题。应该一手抓基本建设，一手抓生产：此处建设，彼处生产；新井、新场建设，老井、老场继续生产；轮番改造，轮番生产。
    为了加速矿山建设，在基本建设和生产中都必须发动群众大闹技术革命。根据不同特点，因地制宜，土法上马，自力更生；坐等支援，吃现成饭，是一种懒汉思想，我们看到几个具体事例，认为值得其他单位学习。一是周山煤矿的溜槽。这个矿生产的焦煤是比较好的，但在一个山窝里运不出去。怎么办？他们没有向困难低头，而是发动群众，利用山岭陡坡，挖了几道溜槽，铺上破缸片，大量的煤就这样滑出来了。一是井湾铁矿场的小土选矿机。铁矿石经过磁选，可以变成富矿。但是，如果坐等洋设备，远水不解近渴。他们采取“三结合”的办法，刻苦钻研，试制成了土选矿机。现在，他们正在设计制造更大的土选矿机，以便更快更多地生产精矿。目前，我们的“小土群”矿山，是既穷又白，手工操作、笨重劳动多。正因为如此，所以潜力很大。群众也迫切要求闹技术革命。把采矿场本身自力更生闹技术革命同城市积极支援紧密地结合起来，就可以加速矿山建设。
    坚决不让低品位的矿石下山，是矿山生产中的一个重要问题。一些小型矿山的矿层中，含铁量参差不齐，有些“鸡窝矿”里，铁矿石中还夹着一些石头、?子土等杂七杂八的东西。如果把这些东西同矿石一起运下山去，从运输到冶炼，将是一个不小的浪费。为了坚决不让低品位的矿石下山，保证小高炉吃细粮，我们同工人、干部商量，采取了几条有效的措施：用算账对比的办法，反复向矿山职工进行提高矿石质量的思想教育，使他们了解低品位矿石下山在运输和冶炼方面造成的浪费，自觉地提高矿石质量，实行矿石分层开采，分级堆放，分级运输，做到“以质论价”；从冶金领导部门到采矿场、工区、井下，建立一套严格的质量检验制度；把采矿场内选矿，作为一道工序固定下来，井内和场内都要选矿，保证含铁量在40％以下的矿石不下山。
