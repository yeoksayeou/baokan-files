    Spend Less Money,
    Accomplish More

    The employees of the Kongtong People's Commune Fertilizer Plant in Pingliang City, Gansu Province, have done a great job! Their deeds of running the plant diligently and thriftily, and their spirit of wholeheartedly serving agriculture, should be praised by the people.
    The establishment of this fertilizer plant once again vividly tells us that on the road to a beautiful and happy socialism, as long as we exert revolutionary vigor, demonstrate the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountains, and work steadily and unremittingly, there are no insurmountable difficulties and no undertakings that cannot be accomplished or done well.
    The Kongtong Fertilizer Plant started on a piece of open ground and three dilapidated temples. At that time, they were truly empty-handed and faced numerous difficulties. But they had ambition, they had drive, and therefore they had methods. If they didn't have tools, they pooled them together; if they didn't have funds, they took on odd jobs to earn money; if they didn't have raw materials, they looked for them in the wild; if they didn't understand the technology, they learned from scratch. They fully displayed the spirit of the Chinese working people under the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, a spirit of standing tall and establishing a business from scratch, working, learning, and creating at the same time. Finally, they built the factory and produced not only local fertilizer but also high-quality fertilizer. Now, they are advancing victoriously and want to develop the fertilizer plant into a comprehensive chemical plant to meet the needs of agricultural production in many ways.
    The reason why the employees of the Kongtong Commune Fertilizer Plant were able to run the fertilizer plant well is mainly because, under the leadership of the commune Party committee, they established the idea of wholeheartedly serving agricultural production. In order to completely change the face of the mountainous area with its lack of fertilizer and low yields, the employees of the Kongtong Commune Fertilizer Plant, in the spirit of serving to the end, went deep into the fields and into the masses to provide meticulous and thoughtful support to agricultural production. They fully utilized the characteristics of commune-run industries being closely linked to the actual situation of local agricultural production, went deep into the fields, went deep into the masses, analyzed the properties of various soils, grasped the laws of crop pests and diseases, and investigated the use of fertilizers in various regions and production teams. Then, in response to the needs, they produced and supplied various types of fertilizers and pesticides, maximizing the effectiveness of their support work.
    This fertilizer plant not only produces various fertilizers according to the different needs of agricultural production, but also arranges production in advance, supplying the needed materials ahead of the farming season. For example, at the beginning of the year, they prepared sufficient base fertilizer for the spring sowing fields, topdressing fertilizer for winter wheat, and pesticides for soil disinfection and wheat pest and disease control for spring plowing; when agricultural production entered the busy seasons of spring plowing and summer planting, the fertilizer plant promptly switched to preparing quick-acting fertilizer for autumn fields, smoke screens for frost prevention, and gunpowder for hail prevention. In the first half of this year, the plant produced more than 1,900 tons of fertilizer and pesticides, with an average application of thirty-eight jin per mu on the commune's 100,000 mu of cultivated land. According to a survey by the Yangzizhai Brigade, wheat fields using fertilizer yielded an additional fifty jin per mu.

    甘肃省平凉市崆峒人民公社化肥厂的职工们干得好！他们勤俭办厂的事迹和忠心耿耿为农业服务的精神，应该得到人民的赞扬。
    这个化肥厂的建立，再一次生动地告诉我们：在走向美好幸福的社会主义的大道上，只要我们发挥革命的干劲，拿出愚公移山的精神，踏踏实实、坚韧不拔地干下去，就没有不可克服的困难，没有干不成、干不好的事业。
    崆峒化肥厂是在一片空地和三间破庙的基础上起家的。当时他们真是两手空空，困难重重。但他们有雄心，有干劲，也就有办法。没有工具自己凑，没有资金就去打短工挣钱，没有原料就到野地里找，不懂技术就从头学。他们充分发扬了我国劳动人民在党和毛主席教导下所具有的那种顶天立地、创家立业的精神，边干、边学、边创造。终于建起了厂，不仅生产了土化肥，而且生产了优质化肥，现在他们正在乘胜前进，要把化肥厂发展成为综合性的化工厂，以便从多方面满足农业生产的需要。
    崆峒公社化肥厂的职工们，所以能够办好了化肥厂，主要是由于他们在公社党委的领导下，树立了全心全意为农业生产服务的思想。为了彻底改变山区缺肥低产的面貌，崆峒公社化肥厂的职工们本着服务到底的精神，深入细致，体贴入微地支援农业生产。他们充分发挥了社办工业密切联系当地农业生产实际的特点，深入田间，深入群众，分析各种土壤的性质，掌握农作物病虫害的规律，调查各种地区和各个生产队使用肥料的情况，然后针对需要，生产供应各种性质的化肥和农药，使支援工作发挥了最大的效用。
    这个化肥厂不仅根据农业生产的不同需要生产各种化肥，而且还做到了提前安排生产，走在农时季节的前面供应需要。比如，在年初就给春播田准备了充足的底肥，给冬小麦准备了追肥，给春耕土壤消毒和小麦病虫害准备了农药；当农业生产进入春耕、夏种大忙时，化肥厂又及时转入为秋田准备速效肥，为防霜生产烟幕弹，为防冰雹生产火药。今年上半年，这个厂共生产化肥农药一千九百多吨，全社十万亩耕地平均施用三十八斤，据养子寨大队调查，施用化肥的小麦地，每亩多收了五十斤。
