    Improving Ore Grade
    The Zhejiang No. 258 Iron Mine is focusing on ore quality. By strengthening geological exploration work, promoting the "step-by-step" advanced tunneling experience, and establishing strict quality inspection systems in every process from mining, loading, unloading, transportation to washing and selection, the ore grade has risen sharply. The average ore grade in July reached 52%, an increase of more than 4% compared to June; in early August, despite continuous heavy rains, the ore grade remained at an advanced level.

    Striving for Perfection in Pig Iron Quality
    Workers at the No. 4 blast furnace of the Banshan Iron and Steel Plant in Zhejiang Province actively studied and promoted advanced operating techniques such as external desulfurization. Leading cadres, workers, and technicians combined their efforts and improved the slag-making system, making the quality of pig iron even better. From the 1st to the 10th, the qualification rate of pig iron was 100% every day, and the coke ratio decreased by 19.3%.

    Building Coking Plants Near Coal Mines
    Each coal mine in Zaozhuang City, Shandong Province, is building "small-scale mass" coking plants near the coal mines. At present, the city has built 11 coking plants around the mines. The amount of coke produced in the first half of the year increased by 104.4% compared to the same period last year. In addition to meeting the needs of the city, more than 250,000 tons were transferred to support the steel production in Jinan, Changwei, and other places.

    Steadfastly Grasping Group Work
    Leading cadres of the Dalian Heavy Machinery Plant in Liaoning Province go deep into the front line of production to focus on group work. They adopt the method of going straight to the bottom and directly meeting with group workers in all tasks, organizing workers to participate in management tasks such as planning, scheduling, technology, and cost accounting, fully implementing the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" experience, and further improving the production and management level of the groups. In just over a week, the production level of more than 80% of the groups has improved significantly, and more than 24% of the groups have jumped from the general level to the advanced level.

    "Multi-Purpose" Automated Machine Tools
    Leading cadres of the Shanghai Automotive Electrical Machinery Plant went deep into the workshops and groups, comprehensively analyzed and evaluated more than 800 technical innovation projects, and proposed different directions for the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of technical revolution in each workshop, quickly launching a new upsurge of technical revolution throughout the plant. The consolidation ratio of innovation projects has increased from 70% to 90.1%, and a number of new innovation projects have been realized. More than 90% of the plant's automated machine tools have achieved "multi-purpose." A body shell screw machine in the second workshop, which processes generator body shells, has been improved to process ten different models of generator body shells.

    Increasing Production and Saving Raw Materials
    The Qingdao No. 2 Rubber Factory mobilized the masses to vigorously increase production and save raw materials, achieving remarkable results. By reforming product design, utilizing scrap materials, developing diversified operations, and producing chemical raw materials themselves, they increased the production of more than 15,000 sets of tires and more than 10,000 sets of rickshaw tires from January to July without increasing raw materials. Product quality has also been continuously improved. The mileage of tires has increased from 60,000 kilometers last year to 80,000 kilometers.

    要闻快报
    提高矿石品位
    浙江省二五八铁矿狠抓矿石质量。通过加强地质勘探工作，推广“阶梯式”先进掘进经验，从采掘、装卸运输到洗选，道道工序建立了严格的质量检查制度，使矿石品位直线上升。七月份矿石平均品位达到百分之五十二，比六月份提高百分之四以上；八月上旬，遇到连日暴雨，矿石品位仍然保持先进水平。
    生铁质量精益求精
    浙江半山钢铁厂四号高炉职工积极学习和推广炉外脱硫等先进操作技术，领导干部、工人和技术人员“三结合”，健全了造渣等制度，使生铁质量精益求精，好上加好。一日至十日生铁合格率天天百分之百，焦比下降百分之十九点三。
    就煤矿大办炼焦厂
    山东枣庄市各煤矿，在煤矿附近大办“小土群”炼焦厂。目前，全市已在矿井周围建起炼焦厂十一个。上半年产焦数量，比去年同期增长百分之一百零四点四，除满足本市需要外，还外调二十五万多吨，支援了济南、昌潍等地的钢铁生产。
    扎扎实实抓小组工作
    辽宁大连起重机器厂领导干部深入生产第一线，大抓小组工作。他们采取一竿子插到底、各项工作都直接同小组工人见面的办法，组织工人参加计划、调度、技术和成本核算等管理工作，全面贯彻“两参一改三结合”的经验，进一步提高了小组的生产和管理水平。一周多的时间内，就有百分之八十以上的小组生产水平提高了一大步，其中百分之二十四以上的小组由一般水平跃为先进水平。
    自动化机床“一机多用”
    上海汽车电机厂领导干部深入车间和小组，对八百多项技术革新项目进行全面分析、鉴定，提出了各车间技术革命巩固、推广、提高的不同方向，在全厂迅速掀起了技术革命新高潮。革新项目的巩固比例，从百分之七十提高到百分之九十点一，并且实现了一批新的革新项目。全厂百分之九十以上的自动化机床实现了“一机多用”。二车间一台加工发电机身壳的撬身壳螺丝机，经过改进，已能加工十种不同型号的发电机身壳。
    增产节约原材料
    青岛橡胶二厂发动群众大搞原材料的增产节约，获得显著成绩。他们通过改革产品设计、利用边角余料和开展多种经营、自己生产化工原料等办法，在不增加原料的情况下，一至七月份为国家增产了一万五千多套轮胎和一万多套力车胎。产品质量也不断提高。轮胎行驶里程由去年的六万公里提高到八万公里。
