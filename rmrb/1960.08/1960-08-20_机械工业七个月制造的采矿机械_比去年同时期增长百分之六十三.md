    Mechanical Industry Manufactures Mining Machinery in Seven Months
    63% Increase Compared to the Same Period Last Year
    (Our report) The national mechanical industry workers are actively supporting the technical transformation of mines. In the first seven months of this year, the mining machinery manufactured in various regions increased by 63% compared with the same period last year; A large number of excavators, winches, drilling machines, belt conveyors, crushing and grinding machines and other equipment have been continuously transported to the mines.
    Among the mining machinery manufactured by the mechanical industry this year, in addition to a batch of large excavators and other equipment suitable for the technical transformation of large mines, there are also many simple and efficient equipment suitable for small and medium-sized mines. For example, a wooden winch can pull a mine car loaded with one and a half tons each time, while manual lifting of ore can only carry 200 kilograms per trip for two strong laborers. Among these equipments, there are also some advanced machines that have newly emerged in the technical revolution movement, such as coal shoveling machines.

    机械工业七个月制造的采矿机械
    比去年同时期增长百分之六十三
    本报讯　全国机械工业职工积极支援矿山技术改造。今年前七个月，各地制成的采矿机械比去年同期增加了63％；大批挖掘机、卷扬机、打眼机、皮带运输机、破碎研磨机等设备，已经源源运到矿山。
    机械工业部门今年制造的矿山机械中，除有一批大型挖掘机等适应大型矿山技术改造的设备外，还有很多适合中小型矿山使用的简易的、高效率的设备。例如，木制卷扬机牵引矿车每次能装一吨半，而用人工抬矿石，两个强劳动力每次只能抬二百公斤。这些设备当中，还有一些攉煤机等在技术革命运动中新出现的先进机械。
