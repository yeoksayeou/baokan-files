Xinhua News Agency report: The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on the 19th, requiring leaders at all levels in both new and old sugar beet production areas to help people's communes properly arrange labor and strengthen late-stage field management of sugar beets in order to strive for further improvement in the yield per unit area of sugar beets.

The notice stated that for some sugar beet fields with weed infestations, concentrated hoeing must be carried out to ensure that not a single mu is left untended. Sugar beets are prone to pests and diseases in August and September, so pest control work must be promptly carried out to ensure that "every mu is protected; every live plant is harvested." In the new southern sugar beet production areas, where there is abundant rainfall in autumn, drainage ditches must be dug to prevent waterlogging.

The notice requested all localities to focus on managing third-class and second-class seedlings, actively eliminating third-class seedlings, upgrading second-class seedlings, and strive to universally apply topdressing fertilizer and soil cultivation to sugar beets once. According to experiments, foliar application of 1.5% superphosphate leachate to sugar beets half a month to a month before harvest has a very significant effect on increasing production. This can be promoted in key areas where conditions permit.

The notice finally requested all localities to make preparations for harvesting, slicing, and local sugar processing to welcome the sugar beet harvest.

    加强甜菜后期管理
    农业部向各产区发出通知
    据新华社讯　农业部19日发出通知，要求甜菜新、老产区的各级领导，帮助各人民公社妥善安排劳力，加强甜菜后期田间管理，争取进一步提高甜荣的单位面积产量。
    通知说，对一些有草荒现象的甜菜田要突击中耕，保证不荒一亩，8、9月份甜菜容易发生虫害，必须抓紧防治工作，做到“有一亩，保一亩；活一棵，收一裸”。南方甜菜新产区秋季雨水多，须要做好挖沟排水防涝工作。
    通知要求各地，要抓紧管理三类苗、二类苗，积极消灭三类苗，提升二类苗，并要争取给甜菜普遍进行一次追肥、培土。据试验：甜菜用1.5%的过磷酸钙浸出液在收获前半个月到一个月对叶部进行根外施肥，增产效果很显著。在有条件的地区可以重点推行。
    通知最后要求各地要做好收获、切削和土糖加工的准备工作，迎接甜菜收获。
