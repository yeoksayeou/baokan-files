Literature Must Run Ahead of the Times	Ba Jin

At the Second Enlarged Council Meeting of the Chinese Writers Association (1956), I made a brief speech, talking about some personal feelings. When I spoke of the supreme happiness of writers in New China, I said this: “We live in such a great era, on such a lovely land, among such hard-working and brave people, surrounded by a full and colorful life; before us unfolds a more glorious and beautiful prospect. We have an inexhaustible source of rich material, we have millions of enthusiastic readers who cherish creation. Our works play a role among the broad masses, and we ourselves are also educated in the process of writing. We are following the times, the times are pushing us forward, and our works may also promote the times to advance. … We are doing a glorious cause that our predecessors could not have dreamed of…” Four full years have passed. Today, I feel that I have more courage and greater confidence. This is not because I personally have any achievements worth mentioning in these four years. On the contrary, I have not properly fulfilled the responsibilities of a writer. However, even I can see very clearly how many earth-shaking changes have taken place in our motherland during these four years, and how many miracles of moving mountains and overturning seas have emerged. Especially since 1958, the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune have enabled our motherland to sprint forward at a high speed of one day equaling twenty years, and our boiling life, surging with heat, radiates brilliant light. The light of communism illuminates the future of 650 million people. The upsurge of technological innovation and technological revolution of the Chinese working class has converged into a sea of red flags in the first spring of the 1960s. At the same time, a flourishing scene of a hundred flowers blooming and a riot of colors has also appeared in our socialist literary garden. Our literary cause has also presented a new situation of the Great Leap Forward and great development. An unprecedented and vigorous mass creation movement has attracted tens of thousands of people; a large number of new folk songs with national style, national spirit, and high ideological and artistic quality have created a poetic style of a generation, inspiring the people of the whole country to march forward in unison. Excellent works loved by the masses, such as "Red Flag Manual" and "History of Entrepreneurship," have been published one after another, and short stories with clear attitudes and novel styles have emerged in large numbers, inspiring and educating the broad readers. What is even more gratifying is that many talented authors from worker and peasant backgrounds have joined our ranks with vigorous vitality and healthy feelings, injecting new and healthy blood into our socialist literary cause. Without exception, wherever there is a fiery struggle, there are exciting poems. Many advanced workers have just put down their production tools and picked up their vivid poetic pens. Many brilliant achievements and vivid deeds on the industrial and agricultural fronts have quickly been reflected in literary works and spread throughout the country. Works depicting thrilling revolutionary struggles and the noble qualities and heroic spirit of people's heroes have also become indispensable spiritual food for Chinese youth. I have seen car drivers reading "Tracks in the Snowy Forest" attentively when parking; in the remote Honghe Autonomous Prefecture, I have also heard young people enthusiastically talking about "Mountain Village Changes" and "Song of Youth"; in the dormitories of single workers in Gejiu, I saw "How Steel Was Tempered"; on the stone benches under the weeping willows on the shore of West Lake, a young cadre spent his Sunday reading "Red Sun". The heroic figures with new moral values ​​塑造的 in our literary works are often the loyal friends and role models for advancement of the broad readers. Moreover, I can also say that the literature of New China is not only a cause loved by the people of the whole country, but also a cause of all progressive human beings. Many of our writers often receive enthusiastic letters from foreign readers. The new people and new things that appear in our works have also encouraged the courage of foreign readers to struggle. The positive role of our works is expanding day by day. Our cause is flourishing day by day. On our broad Yangguan Avenue, the ranks of writers advancing under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought are constantly developing and growing stronger. What a magnificent scene, what a glorious future!

The reason why I first describe the beautiful scene here is nothing more than to illustrate how heavy our writers' responsibilities are. Since the people need us, we should serve the people wholeheartedly, and we should write more and better works to meet the needs of the broad readers. We must treat this issue seriously. Readers will never嫌好作品太多. The more good works there are, the greater the positive effect will be. What's more, we have 650 million people! Today, people all over the country, regardless of men, women, old or young, are dedicating all their strength to building our motherland, and we so-called soul engineers should not lag behind. Like ordinary laborers, writers can only be tempered in continuous practice and sustained labor. We must throw ourselves into intense labor and use the fruits of labor to add bricks and tiles to the socialist building. We must write constantly, continuously refine, refine our pens, catch up with the era flying forward, seize the advanced deeds that emerge in large numbers at all times, and quickly reflect them in our new works. We must also strive to create amazing miracles in the literary cause.

I know that comrades will not blame me for unilaterally emphasizing the pursuit of quantity here, because fast and many can be completely combined with good. And first of all, I have to criticize myself. I write little and write poorly. Our life is so rich and colorful, the struggle is so fierce and sharp, and spirited heroes emerge in droves. Their faces are very full, and the deeds themselves are very moving. One revolution a week has miraculously completely changed the face of a factory. Such a life is a perfect work of art! Of course, this is for those writers who are willing to go to the masses and participate in the fiery struggle. Only after their hearts are close to the hearts of the masses, and they share thoughts and feelings with the masses, can they understand and love everything in our life that shines with the light of communism, and express it in a timely and full manner with great enthusiasm. They can then describe new things energetically and brilliantly, and use their excellent works to help new things achieve victory as early as possible. As for those who are full of bourgeois ideas at work, who are blind to new things, who blindly worship the ancients and foreigners, and who hold up a few famous works of the nineteenth century to mourn the old life, they cannot see the brilliance of new things. As for those who peddle revisionist goods and are willing to serve imperialism and capitalism, in their eyes, our ever-changing new life will of course become "pitch black" because there is no future for them in our life. Their specially intentioned clamor for "writing the truth" and demanding so-called "freedom of creation" is nothing more than wanting to use their pens to distort our reality to oppose socialism. This kind of conspiracy can of course not deceive people's discerning eyes. However, those who engage in conspiracies and use various means to attack socialism and the people's literary cause will not surrender after a single blow. Therefore, the struggle between the two roads that has been carried out on the literary and art front for several years has a great significance for all writers. I myself have received a profound education. These ideological struggles have opened my eyes and made me more deeply aware of the urgent need to transform my worldview. Without a correct worldview, it is impossible to master new creative methods to express new people, new life, and new morality, and it is impossible to recognize what is the mainstream in real life, and it will confuse phenomena and essence, and even be unable to distinguish between new forces and corrupt forces. Now, probably no Chinese writer would openly express his unwillingness to accept the Marxist-Leninist worldview. However, it is not easy to use it to observe, experience, study, and analyze life. First of all, one must completely remove the many bourgeois ideas in one's mind. There are many such things in my mind. Although I am constantly fighting them, I still have to make greater efforts in the future.

I was born in a bureaucratic landlord's feudal family and lived in that suffocating autocratic environment for a full eighteen or nine years before I had the opportunity to step out of that iron-clad threshold. But later I got into the small circle of petty-bourgeois intellectuals. When I started writing novels, I shouted that I wanted to break out and change my lifestyle. The feudal family in Chengdu collapsed long ago, and the circle of petty bourgeoisie in Shanghai is not a copper wall or iron wall, but I myself have never had the courage and determination. It can also be seen from this that the past life has accumulated many things in my body. Also, I loved to read novels when I was young, novels from ancient and modern times, both good and bad. I read a lot of them indiscriminately, not for learning, but because I loved to listen to stories since I was a child. I didn't want to learn anything from them. I just wanted to satisfy my curiosity at the time. But as a result, I got a lot of things, because this is what each takes as needed, and it is absorbed unconsciously. The authors of those novels were either feudal literati or at least bourgeois writers. I also vaguely felt that these two kinds of people had fought in my mind, and it wasn't long before the feudal literati were driven away. As for myself, I have not been vaccinated, and I can imagine how many germs have gotten into my body, and I have brought them into my articles. In fact, I cannot completely push the responsibility to books and authors, nor can I say that I have not benefited a little from those novels. I have also been inspired and encouraged by some excellent works, which made me more courageous to pursue the light and hate the darkness. I myself have said more than once that if I had not read so many novels, then when I was alone in Paris in March and April 1927, I had something to say, emotions to express, and love and hatred to pour out, I would not have written down my thoughts and feelings in the form of a novel. However, in many novels I have written myself, I can find all kinds of germs that I have contracted from other places. Needless to say, there are more moldy and blackened things that come from my life. Although I don't want to put any germs or dregs into my works, and I myself can't stand them, they themselves have gotten into my books. This statement of mine is not to show off and make creation mysterious. I have had such an experience: writers often live in their own works, so they cannot pretend in their works. It is impossible for a writer not to expose his thoughts in his works. Writers often involuntarily write in novels what they like and what they are used to thinking: writers also often let the characters in their works speak for themselves. And some of our feudal literati go even further: they write themselves as omnipotent heroes, and they want to do in novels what they have longed for but cannot do in life. I have long forgotten the names of such writers who enjoy writing novels, and I am only using their examples here to illustrate my point: writers have the habit of expressing themselves in their works. I often see the author himself in some works, and similarly, others will see the past me in my novels. In those novels of mine, I did not point out a clear path to the readers, because I myself had not found such a way out at the time. I myself have often thought about why so many critical realist writers in Europe in the nineteenth century wrote such a large pile of case histories, but refused to write a prescription? Why do they only have a sense of grief and indignation, cannot stand the success of bad people, cannot stand the smoky atmosphere, but can only spread a faint sadness, nameless troubles, and pessimistic and desperate emotions everywhere? It turns out that they themselves have not found a way out and do not know the prescription for curing the disease. They wasted a lot of energy and paid hard work in vain, but only became bystanders in life.

The above examples only illustrate that if our writers today do not earnestly and persistently transform themselves, it is difficult not to bring those wrong and harmful things into their works. Some people always add some shortcomings when writing positive characters, possibly because the author himself appreciates people with shortcomings; some people write heroes and models very pale and without any brilliance, possibly because the heroes in the author's mind are another kind of person. These writers do not necessarily want to expose themselves in their works, but they cannot hide their thoughts, feelings, and positions when they write. Therefore, people with bad moral character and backward thinking, even if they have very high talents, cannot write works that inspire people and encourage them to move forward; to write new people and new things well, one must love new people and new things. Writers who do not have communist ideas cannot educate the people in the spirit of communism. Writers who truly love our society today will never write novels that slander the new society. It is said that some people have read some good works that expose the dark side of capitalist society and think that to improve their skills, they must write about the dark side. If they cannot find the dark side in the new society, they deliberately amplify some individual shortcomings, or even simply fabricate facts and write about the dark side. This kind of person actually has ulterior motives, hangs a sheep's head to sell dog meat, and is willing to take the same path as the revisionists, because those who love the new society see the magnificent scene of sunshine shining on the earth in our radiant life, and hear the magnificent triumphal song of light triumphing over darkness. Those who are looking for the dark side are deliberately telling lies in their works, but they do not think that they will honestly expose their souls to the readers. They are also constantly clamoring for "writing the truth" and think that they have written the truth. Have they really written the truth? No, they are looking at the bright new society with dark eyes. Isn't the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past three years, which has shocked the world, real? Isn't it true that the Chinese working class, with a communist style and truly selfless labor, has rapidly changed the face of our motherland? Isn't it true that the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fought side by side and defeated the American invading army? Isn't it true that the American imperialist lackey Syngman Rhee was driven off the stage by the South Korean people and ran away with his tail between his legs? The solemn condemnation and heroic struggle of the Japanese people made Nobusuke Kishi, the head of the traitorous clique, restless and had to resign and get out, scaring the American imperialists to withdraw some spy planes. Eisenhower's bandit face has been completely exposed, and he has made a big fool of himself in front of the people of the world. As soon as he travels, he tastes the stones of the Philippines and the closed doors of Japan. In addition to the rumbling cannon fire in the Taiwan Strait and the siege of 100,000 people in Okinawa, he was frightened and dejected, and had to go back with a thick skin. Isn't this true? Imperialism and capitalism are at the end of their rope, socialism and communism are rising like the rising sun; the old system is dying, and the new society is shining brightly. This is the greatest and truest truth. To write the truth, one must write this. A few flies and a few piles of garbage do not need the gentlemen to spend much thought. If there are really flies flying by, a "Young Pioneer" will immediately pick up a fly swatter and kill them. As for garbage, not only will yesterday's garbage dump become today's beautiful garden, but even garbage, sewage, and waste materials will now serve socialism and create wealth. How can someone who is a writer still cling to the past garbage and make a fuss about it?

However, bourgeois writers and revisionists slander us for "not having freedom of creation" precisely because we have not written about flies and garbage. In fact, this is precisely what we can be proud of. We do not write about flies and garbage because we feel that we have a major responsibility to the readers, and our works are fighting weapons and educational tools. In New China, as in the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, writers enjoy the greatest freedom of creation. We can freely choose subjects and freely adopt forms of expression. We can go anywhere to go deep into life and participate in the fiery struggle. We only lack one kind of "freedom", that is, the "freedom" to spread rumors and lies. Our literature is part of the socialist cause. The labor of writers is often cared for and valued by the Party and the people. When we writers are engaged in creation, we have not been interfered with in any way, on the contrary, we have received endless encouragement and help. Whether we go to factories, rural areas, troops, construction sites, mountainous areas, or islands, we are warmly welcomed everywhere, and people treat us like relatives. We are not bystanders in life, we participate in the life we ​​describe. We have the opportunity to work with the protagonists of our works, laugh together, contact the raging struggle life, experience exciting and vivid scenes, we use our works to serve the socialist construction cause of the motherland, water a little bit of the budding of communism, and can also see them blooming and bearing fruit among the readers... These freedoms are not available to writers in capitalist countries, and they cannot obtain them. This is true freedom of creation. However, some writers in capitalist countries are shamelessly boasting about their "freedom of creation" everywhere. I still remember a foreign female writer who had been to the United States bragging about her "freedom of creation" in front of us. Where is her so-called "freedom"? In fact, I also know something about the situation there. In her country, as in the United States, the works of writers are just commodities in the hands of publishing company bosses. Works that can make money for the boss are good works. In the United States, the bosses of large publishing companies can use negotiated profit sharing and capitalist management methods to make a book a bestseller with hundreds of thousands of copies in the first edition before it is published. Unlike here, the number of copies of books is determined according to the needs of readers. No wonder novels that teach people to be obscene and thieves flood the market in capitalist countries. Using erotic intoxication to corrode and harm young minds; works that drill into horns, tell lies, and play with words are everywhere, making readers wander and lose their way, pessimistic and desperate. We can proudly say that socialist freedom of creation is indeed different from capitalist freedom of creation. This is the difference between light and darkness, good and evil, beauty and ugliness!

When I wrote novels in the old society, I did not enjoy any freedom of creation. I left the masses, picked up a pen and closed the door to write. I called myself "fighting alone", but "loneliness" was the truth, and "fighting" should be discounted. However, even so, the censors of the Kuomintang's books and magazines would not let me go. I had to often use euphemisms and roundabout ways of speaking in my works to avoid causing trouble to the publications that published my articles. Even a year before the War of Resistance Against Japan, when I wrote about Japanese ronin in Shanghai in the short story "Under the Window", I could not use the word "Japan". Two years before the War of Resistance Against Japan, I wrote a "Diary of a Day in Tokyo Prison" in Japan and sent it back to Shanghai. The censor simply took it away. This prose has never been published. Later, I changed it to "A Nightmare in a Room" before it could be printed in a collection of short stories. This is because the Japanese ronin did not allow us to say bad things about them, and the Kuomintang was afraid that we would say bad things about the Japanese ronin... In those days, although I had never put down my pen, I did not have a scientific mind, revolutionary practice, or a correct worldview. Away from the people, I only had a young man's sense of justice and an enthusiastic pen. I could not find a way out in life, and of course I could not find a way out in creation. I wholeheartedly pursued the light, but in the old society I only saw darkness. The first chapter of my first novel is "A Soul's Groan in the Boundless Darkness". The first sentence of the preface to my first collection of short stories is "Every night, a cry echoes in my ears." In the postscript to the last novel I wrote before liberation, there are these words, "Today the weather is indeed terribly cold. On the newspaper beside me, there is a large headline saying that the temperature is below zero all day, and more than 100 bodies have been collected from the streets in the past two days." I really wanted to arrange a happy ending for honest ordinary people in my works, but in the pitch-black old society, how difficult it was for a person who "struggled" alone and kept himself clean with his own hands and an honest character to get rid of a tragic fate! Readers constantly sent letters complaining, hoping that I could give them some help. But I have never been able to point out a clear path to them. On the contrary, my works brought more suffering to people. I recently reread my works from 1928 to 1948, and I was surprised how I could write so many disasters and pains. I could not stand the pessimistic and desperate endings of many writers in the past. But unexpectedly, there are so many melancholy and painful tones in my own works!

In fact, I was one of the luckier ones among the writers of my generation. Some had to give up their pens forever, and some died tragically in poverty and illness in their middle age. But I saw the light of the new society and had the opportunity to use my bald pen, which was used to writing about pain and disaster, to describe the victory and joy of the people. Although I have written very little in these years, I have finally written down some new feelings. I have found my own happiness in the universal happiness of the people of the whole country. I will never forget that day: October 1, 1949, I and many comrades heard Chairman Mao solemnly announce the founding of the People's Republic of China on the Tiananmen Gate Tower in Beijing, watched the countless excited waving hands and the endless red flags waving in the wind on the square, and heard the enthusiastic cheers like spring thunder. At that time, I really felt as if my heart was about to jump out of my mouth. Only those who have suffered for a long time, only writers who have not enjoyed freedom for a long time, understand my feelings. For the first time, I saw so clearly the bright and splendid future of the Chinese people, as beautiful as flowers and as fiery as fire! The voices that cheered "Long live Chairman Mao" for six consecutive hours that day, and Chairman Mao's loud and kind answer: "Long live comrades!" are still in my ears, and they have been encouraging me to move forward!

I think there is no need for me to continue to describe the earth-shaking changes that everyone has experienced. They have been reflected in the many excellent and outstanding works of the comrades. These works, with varying lengths and diverse styles, will be passed down as glorious records of our great era. Of course, our reality today is more glorious and exciting than these works, and it runs faster and farther; the heroic figures in real life are fuller and more brilliant than the protagonists in the writers' pens, and they shine with more communist light. But there is no reason to say that our literature cannot keep up with the times. On the contrary, our literature will definitely run ahead of the times in the future. Our writers all have the ambition to climb peaks. It is certain that writers in New China will climb the peaks of literature. Only in this way can we be worthy of the magnificent spirit of the 650 million Chinese people who have stood up. Since our athletes have already climbed the world's highest peak, why can't our literary and art fighters plant the five-star red flag on the summit of world proletarian literature!

We are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we have the correct leadership and enthusiastic care of the Party, we are advancing together with 650 million people, what difficulties cannot be overcome, what miracles cannot be created, what cause cannot be accomplished! Let us unite more closely, set the greatest ambition, muster the soaring enthusiasm, and hold high the banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought to forge ahead courageously.

    文学要跑在时代的前头	巴金
    在中国作家协会第二次理事会扩大会议（1956年）上我曾作过简短的发言，谈一些个人的感受。我谈到新中国作家的莫大幸福的时候，说过这样的话：“我们生活在多么伟大的时代里，多么可爱的国土上，多么勤劳、勇敢的人民中间，在我们周围有着充实、多彩的生活；在我们前面展开更光辉、更美丽的远景。我们有取之不尽的丰富题材，我们有千百万爱护创作的热心读者。我们的作品在广大的群众中间起作用，我们自己在写作过程中也受到教育。我们跟着时代前进，时代推动我们前进，我们的作品也有可能推动时代前进。……我们正在做着我们的前辈作家所梦想不到的光荣事业……”整整四年过去了。今天，我觉得我有了更多的勇气和更大的信心。这不是因为我个人在这四年中有什么值得提说的成绩。恰恰相反，我并未好好地尽了作家的职责。然而连我也看得很清楚，这四年中间在我们祖国发生了多少惊天动地的变化，出现了多少移山倒海的奇迹。尤其是1958年以来总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三大法宝使我们祖国以一天等于二十年的高速度向前飞奔，使我们热浪滚滚的沸腾生活放射万丈红光。共产主义的光芒照亮了六亿五千万人民的前程。中国工人阶级技术革新和技术革命的高潮在六十年代的第一个春天汇成了一片红旗的海洋。同时在我们社会主义的文学花园中也出现了百花齐放、万紫千红的繁荣景象。我们的文学事业也呈现出大跃进、大发展的新局面。历史上从未有过的轰轰烈烈的群众创作运动吸引了千千万万的人；大量的、有民族风格、民族气魄、思想性和艺术性都很高的新民歌创造了一代的诗风，鼓舞着全国人民齐步前进。像《红旗谱》、《创业史》等等群众喜爱的优秀作品接连地出版，态度鲜明、风格崭新的短篇小说大量地出现，使广大的读者受到了鼓舞和教育。更值得高兴的是不少有才能的工农出身的作者带着蓬勃的朝气和健康的感情加入了我们的队伍，给我们社会主义的文学事业注入了新的健康的血液。毫无例外，在有火热斗争的地方就有激动人心的诗篇。许多先进工作者刚刚放下生产工具，就拿起生花的诗笔。不少工农业战线上辉煌的成就和生动的事迹很快地就反映在文学作品中而传遍全国。表现惊心动魄的革命斗争和人民英雄的崇高品质与英勇气概的作品也已成为中国青年所不可缺少的精神食粮。我见过汽车驾驶员在停车的时候专心阅读《林海雪原》；在遥远的红河自治州我还听见年青人热心地谈论《山乡巨变》和《青春之歌》；在个旧单身工人的宿舍里我看到了《百炼成钢》；在西湖湖滨垂柳下石凳上一个年青干部读着《红日》渡过他的星期天。我们文学作品中所塑造的有着新的道德观的英雄人物常常是广大读者的忠实朋友和前进榜样。而且我还可以这样说，新中国的文学已经不止是全国人民热爱的事业，而且是全体进步人类的事业了。我们不少作家经常接到国外读者的热情信函。我们作品中出现的新人新事也鼓舞了国外读者斗争的勇气。我们的作品所产生的积极作用一天天地在扩大。我们的事业一天天地在繁荣。在我们的宽广的阳关大道上，高举着毛泽东思想的旗帜前进的作家队伍不断地在发展，在壮大。这是多么壮丽的景象，这是多么光辉的前途！
    我在这里首先描绘美丽的景象，无非说明我们作家的责任多么重大。既然人民需要我们，我们就应当全心全意地为人民服务，就应当写出更多更好的作品来满足广大读者的需要。我们必须严肃地对待这个问题。读者从来不会嫌好作品太多。好作品越多，产生的积极作用也越大。何况我们有六亿五千万人民！今天全国人民不分男女老幼都献出全部力量来建设我们的祖国，我们这些所谓灵魂工程师更不应该落在后面。作家跟普通劳动者一样，只有在不断的实践与持续的劳动中得到锻炼。我们必须投到紧张的劳动中去，用劳动的成果来为社会主义的大厦添上一砖一瓦。我们必须不停地写，不断地炼，炼好我们的笔，赶上向前飞奔的时代，捉住时时刻刻大批涌现的先进事迹，把它们迅速地反映在我们的新作品里面。我们也要争取在文学事业中创造出惊人的奇迹。
    我知道同志们不会责备我在这里片面地强调追求数量，因为快和多是完全可以同好结合起来的。而且首先就得批评我自己，我写得少又写得差。我们的生活是那样丰富多彩，斗争是那样激烈尖锐，意气风发的英雄人物成群结队地产生，他们的面貌非常丰满，事迹本身就十分动人。一个星期革一个命，奇迹一般地完全改变了一个工厂的面目。这样的生活就是完美的艺术品！当然，这是对那些肯到群众中去、愿意参加火热斗争的作家说的。只有在他们的心跟群众的心贴在一起，自己和群众共思想同感情之后，他们才懂得热爱我们生活中一切闪着共产主义光芒的东西，用极大的热情把它及时地、充分地表现出来。他们才能够精力充沛、才华焕发地描写新的事物，而且用他们优秀的作品来帮助新事物尽早地取得胜利。至于那些满脑子资产阶级思想在作怪、对新事物熟视无睹的人，那些盲目崇拜古人和外国人、捧起几本十九世纪的名著凭吊旧生活的人，他们是看不到新事物的光辉的。至于那些贩卖修正主义货色、甘心为帝国主义、资本主义服务的人，在他们的眼里我们的气象万千的新生活当然会变成了“漆黑一团”，因为在我们生活里是没有他们的前途的。他们别有用意地叫嚷“写真实”，要求所谓“创作自由”，也无非想用他们的笔歪曲我们的现实来反对社会主义。这种阴谋诡计当然骗不了人们雪亮的眼睛。但是那些搞阴谋诡计、用种种手段向社会主义和人民文学事业进攻的人，也不会一遭痛击就缴械投降。所以几年来在文艺战线上进行的两条道路的斗争，对所有的作家来说，都有重大的意义。我自己就受到了深刻的教育。这些思想斗争使我的眼睛睁大了，使我更深刻地认识到改造世界观的迫切需要。没有正确的世界观就不能掌握新的创作方法来表现新的人、新的生活与新的道德，就认不清什么是现实生活中的主流，就会把现象和本质混在一起，甚至于连新生力量和腐朽力量也区别不出来。现在大概不会有公然表示不愿意接受马克思列宁主义世界观的中国作家了。可是要用它来观察、体验、研究、分析生活，却不是容易的事，首先就得把自己脑子里那许多资产阶级思想完全去掉。我的脑子里就有不少那样的东西，虽然我不断地在跟它们作斗争，但是今后我还得作更大的努力。
    我生在官僚地主的封建家庭里，在那个要闷死人的专制环境中整整生活了十八、九年，才有机会跨出那一道包铁皮的门槛。可是后来我又钻进了小资产阶级知识分子的小圈子里面。我开始写小说的时候，我就嚷着要突围出去，要改变生活方式。成都那个封建家庭早垮了，我在上海那个小资产阶级的圈子也并非铜墙铁壁，可是我自己一直没有勇气和决心。从这里也看得出过去的生活在我的身上日积月累地留下了许多东西。还有，我年青时候很爱读小说，古今中外的小说，好的坏的我都读过不少，我不加选择地阅读它们，并非为了学习，只是因为我从小就爱听故事。我并不想向它们学习什么，我当时也无非想满足自己的好奇心。可是结果我得到了不少的东西，因为这是各取所需，而且是不知不觉中吸取来的。那些小说的作者要不是封建文人，至少也是资产阶级的作家。我也曾隐约地感觉到这两种人在我的脑子里打过架，不到多久封建文人就给赶跑了。我自己呢，我并没有打过防疫针，可以想到有多少病菌钻进了我的身上，而我又把它们带到我的文章里面。其实我不能把责任完全推给书本和作者，而且也不能说我没有从那些小说得过一点益处。我也曾从一些优秀的作品里得到了启发和鼓舞，使我更有勇气追求光明，憎恨黑暗。我自己还不止一次地讲过，我如果不曾读过那许多小说，那么我1927年3、4月一个人在巴黎有话要说、有感情需要宣泄、有爱憎必须倾吐的时候，我也不会用小说的形式写下自己的思想、感情来。但是在我自己写的许多小说中就可以找到我从别处传染来的各种各样的病菌。不用说，还有更多的发霉、发黑的东西是从我的生活里来的。虽然我并不想把任何病菌或渣滓放进我的作品里面，而且我本人也受不了它们，可是它们自己却钻到我的书里面来了。我这种说法并非卖弄玄虚，把创作说成神秘。我有过这样一种体会：作家常常在自己的作品里面生活，因此他无法在作品里装假。一个作家要不在作品里暴露自己的思想是不可能的。作家常常不由己地把自己喜欢的事情和自己习惯的想法写在小说里面：作家也常常让作品中的人物替自己讲话。而我们有些封建文人却走得更远，更远：他们把自己写成能文能武、十全十美的主人公，自己在生活中想望过而做不到的事都要在小说里做到。这种靠写小说过瘾的作家，我早已忘记了他们的名字，我在这里也只是借用他们的例子来说明我的意见：作家有在作品中表现自己的习惯。我常常在一些作品中看到作者本人，同样，别人也会在我的小说中看到过去的我。在我那些小说中我不曾给读者指出明确的道路，就因为我自己当时并没有找到这样的出路。我自己也常常想过，为什么十九世纪欧洲许多批判的现实主义作家写了那么一大堆病史，而不肯开一张药方呢？为什么他们空有一腔悲愤，看不惯坏人得志，受不了乌烟瘴气，却只能到处散布淡淡的哀愁、无名的烦恼和悲观、绝望的情调呢？原来他们自己就没有找到出路，也不知道治病的药方。他们白白耗费了巨大的精力，付出了艰苦的劳动，却只做了生活的旁观者。
    以上这些例子不过说明：我们今天的作家如果不认真地、坚持地改造自己，就很难不把那些错误的、有害的东西带到作品里去。有人写正面人物总要加一些缺点，可能因为作者自己欣赏有缺点的人；有人把英雄模范写得十分苍白，毫无光彩，可能因为作者心目中的英雄是另一类人。这些作家并不一定想在作品中暴露自己，然而他们下笔的时候却无法掩藏自己的思想感情和立场观点。所以道德品质恶劣、思想落后的人，即使有很高的才能，也写不出振奋人心、鼓舞人们前进的作品；要写好新人新事，自己就得热爱新人新事。作家自己没有共产主义的思想，也就不可能以共产主义的精神教育人民。真正热爱我们今天社会的作家绝不会写出诬蔑新社会的小说。据说居然有人读了一些揭露资本主义社会阴暗面的好作品，就认为要提高技巧必须大写阴暗面，他在新社会里找不到阴暗面，就把一些个别的缺点故意放大，甚或索性捏造事实，编写阴暗面。这种人其实别有用心，挂羊头卖狗肉，甘愿和修正主义者走一条路，因为热爱新社会的人在我们光芒四射的生活里看到的是阳光普照大地的雄伟景象，听到的是光明战胜黑暗的壮丽凯歌。这些找寻阴暗的人存心在作品里说假话，可是他们却想不到会向读者老老实实地暴露了自己的灵魂。他们也不断地嚷着“写真实”，也以为自己写了真实。他们真的写了真实吗？不，他们是用阴暗的眼光看光明的新社会。难道中国人民三年来震惊世界的持续大跃进不是真实吗？中国工人阶级以共产主义的风格和真正忘我的劳动迅速地改变了我们祖国的面貌，难道这不就是真实吗？中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战把美国侵略军队打得落花流水，难道这不就是真实吗？美帝国主义豢养的走狗李承晚被南朝鲜人民赶下台夹起尾巴偷偷逃走。日本人民的严正讨伐和英勇斗争打得卖国集团的头子岸信介坐卧不安，不得不辞职滚蛋，吓得美帝国主义不得不撤走一部分间谍飞机。艾森豪威尔的强盗面目已经完全揭穿，在世界人民面前大出丑，他一出行就尝到了菲律宾的石头和日本的闭门羹。再加上台湾海峡的隆隆炮声和冲绳岛十万群众的包围，吓得他垂头丧气，只好厚起脸皮滚回去。难道这不就是真实吗？帝国主义、资本主义穷途末路，社会主义、共产主义旭日东升；旧制度奄奄一息，新社会光芒万丈，这才是最大的、真正的真实。要写真实，就得写这个。几只苍蝇和几堆垃圾，倒用不着先生们多花心思。要是真有苍蝇飞过，一个“红领巾”也会马上拿起苍蝇拍把它打死。至于垃圾，不但昨天的垃圾堆会变成今天美丽的花园，而且连垃圾、连污水、废料现在也要为社会主义服务创造财富了。哪有身为作家的人还死死地抱住过去的垃圾大做文章？
    可是资产阶级的作家和修正主义者偏偏因为我们没有写苍蝇和垃圾，就诬蔑我们“没有创作自由”。其实这正是我们可以引以为骄傲的地方。我们不写苍蝇和垃圾，这是因为我们感到自己对读者负有重大的责任，我们的作品是战斗的武器和教育的工具。在新中国和在苏联以及其它兄弟国家一样，作家们享有最大的创作自由。我们可以自由选择题材，自由采取表现的形式，我们可以到任何地方去深入生活，参加火热的斗争。我们就只缺少一种“自由”，那就是造谣说谎的“自由”。我们的文学是社会主义事业的一部分。作家的劳动经常受到党和人民的关怀与重视。我们作家进行创作的时候，不但不曾受到任何干涉，相反地还得到了说不尽的鼓励与帮助。我们不论到工厂、到农村、到部队、到工地、到山区、到海岛，我们到处都受到热烈的欢迎，人们待我们像待亲人一样。我们并不是生活的旁观者，我们参加了自己所描写的生活。我们有机会和我们作品的主人公一起工作，一同欢笑，接触如火如荼的斗争生活，经历激动人心的生动场面，我们用自己的作品为祖国社会主义建设事业服务，给共产主义的萌芽浇一点水，还可以看见它们在读者中间开花结果……这些自由都是资本主义国家的作家们所没有的，而且是他们所得不到的。这才是真正的创作自由。可是某些资本主义国家的作家却反而大言不惭地到处夸耀他们的“创作自由”。我还记得有一位到过美国的外国女作家在我们面前大吹她的“创作自由”。她的所谓“自由”在什么地方呢？其实我也多少了解她那里的情况。在她的国家和在美国一样，作家的作品不过是掌握在出版公司老板手里的商品罢了。能够给老板赚钱的就是好作品。在美国大出版公司的老板们可以用协商分赃的办法和资本主义的经营方式使一本书在出版以前就成为一版几十万册的畅销书。不像在我们这里，书的印数是根据读者的需要来决定的。无怪乎在资本主义的国家里诲淫诲盗的小说充斥市场。用色情的陶醉来腐蚀、戕害年青的心灵；钻牛角尖、讲假话、玩弄文字游戏的作品到处皆是，使读者们仿徨迷路，悲观绝望。我们可以自豪地说：社会主义的创作自由跟资本主义的创作自由的确是不同的，这是光明与黑暗、善与恶、美与丑的差别！ 
    我从前在旧社会中写小说的时候，我并不曾享受过什么创作自由。我脱离群众，一个人拿起笔关上门写作。自己说是“孤独奋斗”，其实“孤独”，倒是真话，说“奋斗”就应当打若干折扣。然而即使是这样，国民党的图书杂志审查老爷也不肯放松我。我不得不常常在作品里使用曲笔转弯抹角地说话，免得给发表我的文章的刊物招来麻烦。甚至在抗战前一年我在短篇小说《窗下》里写到在上海的日本浪人，就不能用“日本”两个字。抗战前两年我在日本写过一篇《东京狱中一日记》寄回上海，检查老爷干脆把它抽去。这篇散文始终没有能发表，后来我把它改成《一个人在屋子里做的噩梦》，才能在短篇集中印了出来。这是因为日本浪人不许我们讲他们的坏话，国民党又害怕我们讲日本浪人的坏话，……在那些时候，我虽然一直不曾放下笔，但是我没有科学的头脑，没有革命的实践，又没有正确的世界观，离开了人民，我空有一个年青人的正义感和一支热情的笔，我在生活里没有找到出路，在创作里当然也找不到出路。我一心追求光明，可是在旧社会中却只看见一片黑暗。我的第一部小说的第一章就是《无边的黑暗中一个灵魂的呻吟》。我的第一本短篇集序言的第一句就是“每夜每夜在我的耳边响着一片哭声。”我在解放前所写的最后一本长篇小说的后记里还有这样的话，“今天天气的确冷得可怕，我手边的日报上就有全天在零度以下，两天来收路尸一百多具的大字标题。”我很想在作品里给正直的普通人安排一个幸福的结局，然而在漆黑一团的旧社会里单靠自己一双手和一个正直性格孤军“奋斗”、独善其身的人要摆脱悲惨的厄运，有多大的困难！读者们不断地寄来诉苦的信，希望我给他们一些帮助。可是我始终不能给他们指出一条明确的路。我的作品反而给人们带来更多的苦恼。我最近重读从1928到1948这二十年中间我的作品，我惊奇自己怎么会写出那么多的灾祸和痛苦，我受不了过去许多作家的那种悲观绝望的结尾。可是想不到在我自己的作品中也会有那么多忧郁、痛苦的调子！
    其实在我们那一辈的作家中间我还是比较幸运的一个。有的人不得不永远丢开了笔，有的人贫病交加，刚到中年就悲惨地死去。我却见到了新社会的光明，而且有机会用我那管写惯了痛苦与灾祸的秃笔来描写人民的胜利和欢乐。虽然这些年中间我写得非常少，但是我总算写下了一点新的感情，我在全国人民普遍的幸福中间找到了自己的幸福。我永远忘记不了那一天：1949年10月1日我和不少的同志在北京天安门城楼上听见毛主席庄严地宣告中华人民共和国成立，望着广场上数不清的兴奋地挥动着的手和看不尽的迎风招展的红旗，听见春雷一样的热烈的欢呼。那个时候，我真觉得好像我这颗心就要从口腔跳出来一样。只有长期受苦的人，只有长期享受不到自由的作家，才了解我这种感情。我第一次这么清楚地看到了中国人民光辉灿烂、如花似火的锦绣前程！那一天接连六个小时欢呼“毛主席万岁”的声音，和毛主席响亮而亲切的回答：“同志们万岁！”至今还在我的耳边，它们一直在鼓舞我前进！
    我想，用不着我再往下叙述那些人人都经历过的翻天复地的变化。它们已经反映在同志们的许多优秀出色的作品里面了。这些篇幅有长有短、风格多种多样的作品将作为我们伟大时代的光辉记录而流传下去。自然，我们今天的现实比这些作品更光辉、更激动人心、而且跑得更快、更远；现实生活中的英雄人物比作家笔下的主人公更丰满，更有光彩，而且闪耀着更多的共产主义的光芒。但是没有理由说，我们的文学赶不上时代，相反地我们的文学将来一定要跑在时代的前头。我们的作家都有攀高峰的雄心大志。新中国的作家要攀登文学的高峰，这是一定办得到的。要这样才配得上六亿五千万站起来了的中国人民的雄伟气魄。既然我们的运动健将已经登上了世界第一高峰，为什么我们文艺战士就不能把五星红旗插在世界无产阶级文学的峰顶！
    我们有毛泽东思想的武装，我们有党的正确领导和热情关怀，我们跟着六亿五千万人民一同前进，还有什么困难不能够克服，什么奇迹不可以创造，什么事业不可以完成！让我们更紧密地团结起来，树起最大的雄心，鼓足冲天的干劲，更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的旗帜奋勇前进。
