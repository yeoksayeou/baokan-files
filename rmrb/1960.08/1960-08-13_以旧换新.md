    Trade-In
    Xu Zhaowen
    "Comrade, I want to buy a light bulb."
    "Do you have a broken light bulb? You need to bring a broken one to exchange for a new one!" the salesperson replied.
    This is a snippet of a conversation I had when buying a light bulb at an electrical supply store. I believe this practice of trading in old items for new ones is very meaningful and beneficial, and it is a good thing worth promoting. The trade-in of light bulbs is primarily beneficial to the country. It will save a large amount of valuable industrial raw materials (such as glass, tungsten, zinc, copper, bakelite, etc.), thereby allowing these raw materials to be used where they are more needed. This is infinitely beneficial to our country's socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward. In the movement of vigorously developing technical revolution, many light bulb factories reprocess the collected broken light bulbs and make them shine again. Secondly, the practice of trading in old items for new ones can also cultivate a new fashion of not wasting any waste. "Many grains make a heap," "Many sands form a tower," "Many drops form a river." If everyone can prioritize the country's socialist construction, and follow the trade-in regulations in some places, then a socialist society will arrive sooner!

    以旧换新
    徐照文
    “同志，我要买只电灯泡。”
    “您有使坏了的灯泡吗？要拿使坏了的，才能换买新的！”售货员回答。
    这是我在电料商店里买电灯泡时候的一段对话。我认为这种以旧换新的做法，它的意义和好处很大，也是一件值得提倡的好事情。灯泡的以旧换新，首先是有利于国家。它将节省一大批贵重的工业原料（像：玻璃、钨、锌、铜、电木等），从而把原材料用到更需要的地方去，这对于我国的社会主义建设、大跃进益处无穷尽。在大闹技术革命的运动中，有不少灯泡厂，把收回的坏灯泡加工一下就又重放光明。其次，以旧换新的做法，还可以养成大家不浪费一点废物的新风尚。“积少成多”，“聚沙成塔”，“滴水成河”，如果大家都能以国家社会主义建设为重，按一些地方规定的那样以旧换新，那么就会使社会主义社会早日到来！
