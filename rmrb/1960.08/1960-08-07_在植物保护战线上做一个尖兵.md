    To be a Vanguard on the Plant Protection Front
    In May of this year, I and more than 500 teachers and students from the school went to the Yuge Commune in Lishui County for labor training. During the days of eating, living, and working with the farmers, I deeply fell in love with the countryside and resolved to contribute all my knowledge and strength to the country's agricultural technology transformation.
    In the countryside, we are both students and teachers of the farmers. We helped the Yuge Commune in Lishui County establish a pest and disease prediction and forecasting station, and we made sure to issue regular warnings. We also held various training classes in the countryside to promote and impart technology. In June, during the appropriate period for the prevention and control of bean weevils on broad beans, we taught farmers the method of treating seeds by scalding them with boiling water to eliminate the bean weevils. So far, we have trained more than 300 plant protection technicians in the Yuge Commune, established a pest and disease prevention and control technology network. Now, each management area has at least ten or more pest and disease control personnel, and there is a technician specifically in charge of pests and diseases.
    During the labor training, we also helped the Yuge Commune run fertilizer plants and pesticide plants, and guided them in vigorously developing the production of small chlorella, mycelial feed, and other products.
    Now, the four years of university life are coming to an end. With an excited heart, I await the call of the motherland to take root in the most needed place in the country—the countryside—and completely dedicate what I have learned to the countryside. I am determined to be a vanguard on the plant protection front.

    在植物保护战线上做一个尖兵
    今年5月，我和学校五百多老师和同学，一道下放在溧水县渔歌公社劳动锻炼。在和农民同吃同住同劳动的日子里，我深深地爱上了农村，决心为祖国的农业技术改造，贡献自己的全部知识和力量。
    我们在农村既做农民的学生，又做农民的老师。我们帮助溧水县渔歌公社建立了病虫害预测、预报站，并且做到了定期发警报。我们在农村还举办多种多样的训练班，推广和传授技术。在6月份，正值蚕豌豆象防治的适期，把用开水烫种消灭蚕豌豆象的种子处理方法，教给农民。到目前为止，我们在渔歌公社已培训了三百多个植保技术员，建立了病虫防治技术网，现在每个管理区至少有十个以上的病虫防治员，并且有一个专管病虫的技术员。
    我们在劳动锻炼中，还帮助渔歌公社办了化肥厂、农药厂，指导他们大搞小球藻、菌丝饲料等生产。
    现在，四年的大学生活快要结束，我怀着一颗激动的心，听候祖国的召唤，到祖国最需要的地方——农村去生根立足，把自己学到的东西，完全贡献给农村，决心在植物保护战线上做一个尖兵。
