    Steel City Heroes Fight the Flood
    Xinhua News Agency, Liaoning Daily Correspondent in Anshan
    In early August, the Anshan area experienced several days of heavy rain. Anshan Iron and Steel (Anshan Steel), was hit by unprecedented torrential rains and floods. Faced with a severe test of natural disasters, from leading cadres to ordinary people, from Anshan Steel workers to the city's residents, a tremendous force was formed. Wherever floods struck, leading cadres were there to direct the battle; wherever heavy rain caused disaster, shock teams rushed to the rescue. The heroic behavior of Anshan people in "not fearing danger and sacrificing oneself for the public" in fighting the flood, shone with the golden light of victory on the battlefield of fighting nature!
    
        Miners Bravely Subdue the Flood Peak
    Anshan Steel's raw material base—the Dagushan and Dong Anshan iron mines at the foot of Qianshan Mountain—bore the brunt of the combined attack of torrential rain and flash floods. On the 3rd, floodwaters gathered rapidly around the two mines surrounded by ridges. The crusher room of the Dagushan Mine and the sintering workshop of the Dong Anshan Mine were immediately flooded. Under the leadership of the Anshan Steel Party Committee and the mine Party committees, the miners of each mine immediately joined the battle to protect and rescue the mines.

    In the dispatch room of the Dong Anshan Iron Mine, Yin Guitang, secretary of the mine Party committee, Hu Jiyao, deputy secretary, Zhang Ximan, deputy mine director, and others, watched the development of the flood situation while planning how to drain the flood and ensure normal production. Suddenly, the sintering workshop called an emergency: the sintering machine's feeding belts—No. 45 and No. 46—were about to be submerged... Everyone knew that these two conveyor belts were the main arteries of the entire sintering workshop. The news of the belts being submerged shocked everyone, and the deputy secretary of the Party committee ran to the workshop to direct the sintering workers to first rescue the motors.

    The battle call to rescue belts No. 45 and No. 46 spread like lightning to every corner of the mine. Cadres from the offices ran over barefoot; doctors and nurses from the health center arrived without even changing out of their white gowns; even the cooks from the canteen rushed over with buckets and basins.

    The six water pumps supported by the company had just arrived, and people installed the pumps in only one-third of the usual time, inserting the nozzles into the deepest part of the flood. Unexpectedly, when the workers pushed the power switch, they only heard the motor "whirring—whirring—" dryly, without pumping out any water. The fierce water would not wait, and in a moment even the motor on the water pump would be submerged.

    At this critical moment, an old worker suddenly shouted: The suction pipe must not be filled with water, there is air inside so it can't pump! However, to fill the suction pipe with water, someone had to go into the water and lift the pipe out. The water was not only deep, but also mixed with a lot of ore powder, which was very harmful to the body. Wu Jizhi, a Communist Party member, didn't think about these things at all, and without hesitation took off his coat and jumped into the "red" water. However, the small and weak Wu Jizhi, although he tried several times, the water nozzle seemed to have taken root in the water, and did not move at all.

    Seeing this situation, Communist Party members Xu Haixiang, Gu Naifang, and Communist Youth League member Qi Hongcun, jumped into the water one after another. The four of them worked together and finally lifted the water nozzle out of the water, filled it with water, and put it back into the water. The water pump immediately sent the water to the drainage ditch dozens of meters away. The flood in the factory receded, and the conveyor belt and the base of the belt machine were exposed... As a result, several huge sintering machines produced artificial rich ore three hours ahead of the Party committee's request.
    
      "Pioneers" Work Together to Subdue the Water Dragon
    Heavy rain and floods damaged or submerged more than seventy sections of roadbeds and bridges in a row. But wherever heavy rain and floods struck, the steel transportation soldiers who had long been prepared—a flood prevention and rescue commando team of more than 3,000 people—immediately repaired one place, not allowing the heavy rain and floods to cause damage for one more minute, and protecting the unblocked arteries that are densely distributed throughout Anshan Steel.

    At noon on the 3rd, Liu Jiahe, the leader of the Party group of the commando team stationed next to No. 10 blast furnace to protect the molten iron transport, and an old road maintenance worker, felt that the danger was coming as it had been raining heavily for a day and a night. He immediately convened an expanded meeting of the Party group to conduct an emergency mobilization before the battle. "Comrades, our yellow mud roadbeds..." Liu Jiahe stared at the heavy rain, thought for a moment and then said, "I'm afraid they can't absorb any more water, and something might happen. We..." Before he could finish speaking, the commando team members搶着向党表示决心抢着向党表示决心抢着向党表示决心搶着向党表示决心抢着向党表示决心抢着向党表示决心 snatched to express their determination to the Party in unison: What are we afraid of if the rain gets heavier? If the roadbed is soaked into mud, we will use stone slag to make the roadbed more solid. "That's right, comrades, we are not afraid, not afraid of heavy rain and sticky yellow mud, not afraid of deep water and sharp stone slag..." Liu Jiahe had just said here, when the captain of the commando team, Wang Qihai, took over and said: "Clothes can be soaked and sweat can flow dry, resolutely not allow the blast furnace to stop production." Suddenly, a burst of warm applause resounded throughout the venue, and someone suggested writing these four sentences on a piece of red paper and sending them to the Party branch with gongs and drums.

    They had just arrived at the Party branch when the news came that the main line for transporting molten iron and slag to No. 10 blast furnace was flooded. They put down the letter of determination, turned around and ran back. When they arrived at the scene, they saw that the yellow soil steep wall holding the line had collapsed, and the line was pressed under the yellow mud. Seeing this situation, everyone picked up their tools and carried away the yellow mud, basket by basket. Just as the line was cleared and reinforced, someone came to report that the roadbed for transporting coke and artificial rich ore to No. 10 blast furnace had collapsed and sunk. They divided their forces and rushed to the dangerous spot to rescue the lifeline of No. 10 blast furnace. Wang Qihai, the captain of the commando team, was directing the unloading of stone slag to fill the sunken pit when he suddenly heard the news that the house where his family lived was about to be washed away by the flood. Since the heavy rain began, Wang Qihai had not been home for two nights and three days. Wang Qihai was just mending the roadbed at this time. If it was not repaired quickly, it would not be possible to transport raw materials to the blast furnace. After hearing this news, he picked up a large iron shovel and rushed to unload stone slag. Wang Qihai's selfless behavior moved people's hearts warmly. Everyone fought harder and harder. If the roadbed sank by one millimeter, it would be immediately raised by one millimeter. They persisted until the rain stopped and the sky cleared. As for Wang Qihai's home, the transportation department had already sent people to settle it.
    
        Climbing Mountains and Wading Through Water to Repair Circuits
    The central substation that supplies all the electricity to Anshan Steel was about to be surrounded by the overflowing flood peak. Gu Wanchun, deputy secretary of the Anshan Power Supply Bureau Party Committee, Xin Baoshan, director, and Zhou Laichun, chief engineer, led more than 100 people to rescue it, quickly turning this central substation from danger to safety. Just as the situation had eased, the power distribution room called again: "The high-voltage line to the Gongchangling Iron Mine is interrupted!" The Power Supply Bureau Party Committee immediately convened an emergency meeting, and more than one or two hundred cadres and workers from the entire bureau immediately turned to the two battle lines of production maintenance and circuit repair. The Party Committee decided to send five line patrol teams overnight to conduct line-by-line inspections and repairs on every line under the jurisdiction of the Anshan Power Supply Bureau.

    Just as the commando team going to Gongchangling to inspect the line was about to set off, an old worker wearing a raincloth coat ran breathlessly to the Party branch secretary, asking to join the line patrol as well. He was Zou Xueshi, the old line patrol station chief who had worked on this line for more than seven years and was currently a student at the Anshan Electric Power School on vacation. He had just left the dam he had been guarding for more than forty hours, and before he could even pick up his rice bowl at home, he heard that "the line to Gongchangling was interrupted," so he didn't even bother to put on his shoes and ran over in three steps.

    Zou Xueshi and the other four people, in this thunderous and rainy night, searched forward quickly and carefully along the transmission line leading to the Gongchangling Iron Mine. The line extended to the top of the mountain, and they followed it up the mountain; the line went to the deep valley, and they followed it into the deep valley; the line crossed the river, and they followed it through the flood. Along the way, Zou Xueshi explained the situation of the line to relieve everyone's fatigue. Yu Chunsheng, the leader of the Party group, repeatedly recited the words of Secretary Liu: "We must show the determination of the 25,000-mile Long March," encouraging every line patrol member. In order to grab every second, no one dared to be lazy for a step, wading through water and climbing mountains, running for a day and a night, breaking through numerous dangers and hardships, and finally making a detailed report of the broken line to the leaders of the work area.

    Li Jie, secretary of the Party General Branch of the Engineering Department, and Geng Shixiang, director, led more than 40 rescue team members and rushed to the broken line location overnight after receiving the report from the Zou Xueshi team. The team members carried power poles more than ten meters high from more than a mile away in the two-foot-deep mud, where they could not pull their feet out for half a day, and erected the landing high-voltage line. After more than ten hours of hard work, the eight power poles that had been washed down by the water were erected. The Gongchangling Iron Mine, which had been without power for sixty-three hours and thirty minutes, once again heard the rhythmic sound of motors.
    
    Now the dark clouds have dispersed, the flood has lowered its head, and the sky above Anshan is once again filled with billowing smoke as usual. The heroes of all walks of life who fought against natural disasters and defended Anshan Steel have long since returned to their original battle positions. They are working with twice the effort, ordering the mines to offer more ore powder and demanding more iron and steel from the blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces.

    钢都英雄战洪水
    新华社、辽宁日报驻鞍山记者
    8月初，鞍山地区连降几天暴雨，鞍钢的生产，遭到从没有过的暴雨和洪水的凶猛袭击。在自然灾害的严重考验面前，从领导干部到一般群众，从鞍钢职工到全市人民，顿时汇成一股巨大力量，那里有洪水袭来，那里就有领导干部指挥迎战；那里的暴雨成灾，那里就有突击队员赶来抢救。鞍山人“临危不俱、舍己为公”抗击洪水的英雄行为，在与自然进行斗争的战场上，闪发着胜利的金光！
        矿工英勇降洪峰
    鞍钢的原料基地—千山脚下的大孤山、东鞍山两大铁矿，首当其冲地遭到暴雨和山洪的夹攻。3日，洪水从四面八方，向岗岚环绕的两矿骤集，大孤山矿的破碎机室和东鞍山矿烧结车间顿时涌进了大量洪水。各矿矿工在鞍钢党委和矿党委领导下，即刻卷入了保卫矿山抢救矿山的战斗。
    在东鞍山铁矿的调度室里，矿党委书记殷桂堂、副书记胡继尧、副矿长张锡满等人，一面注视着水情的发展，一面部署如何排除洪水，保证生产正常进行。烧结车间突然打来电话告急：烧结机的供料皮带—四十五号和四十六号皮带快被淹没了……。谁都知道，这两条运输皮带，是整个烧结车间的总动脉，皮带被淹的消息，冲击着每个人的心，党委副书记跑步来到车间，指挥烧结工人们首先抢救电机。
    抢救四十五和四十六号皮带的战斗号召，闪电似的传遍全矿每一个角落。科室的干部赤着脚跑来了；保健所的医生和护士，来不及换下白色隔离衣赶到了；就连食堂的炊事员，也提着桶端着盆飞奔来了。
    公司支援的六台水泵刚到，人们仅用往常三分之一的时间，就把水泵安好，水龙头插进洪水最深的地方。不料，当工人推上电源开关后，只听得电动机
  “呜—呜—”地干转，却抽不出水来。猛水不等人啊，再过片刻连水泵上的电动机部要被淹了。
    在这千均一发之际，忽然一个老工人大声喊道：一定是吸水管里没灌满水，里边有空气就抽不出来！可是，要把吸水管灌满水，必须有人下水，把管子抬出来。水，不仅很深，里边还混杂有很多矿粉，对人的身体非常有害。共产党员吴吉智，却根本没想到这些，毫不犹豫地脱下外衣，一纵身就跳进“红色”的水里。然而，身小力弱的吴吉智，虽然连扛几次，水龙头好像在水里生了根，微丝不动。
    看到这种情景，共产党员徐海祥、顾乃芳和共青团员齐洪存，卜通、卜通接着跳下水去。四个人齐心协力，终于把大水龙头举出水面灌满了水，重新放到水底。水泵顿时把水送到几十米以外的排水沟，厂房里的洪水退却了，运输皮带、皮带机底座跟着露出水面，……。结果，几台庞大的烧结机，比党委要求的时间提前三小时，吐出人造富矿。
      “先行”齐心缚蚊龙
    暴雨和洪水一连冲坏或淹没路基和桥梁七十多处。可是暴雨和洪水袭击一处，早就做好准备的钢铁运输兵—一支三千多人组成的防洪抢险突击队伍，立即抢修好一处，不允许暴雨和洪水多危害一分钟，保卫住密布全鞍钢的动脉畅通无阻。
    3日中午，驻守在十号高炉旁、保护离炉运输的突击队党小组长、老养路工人刘家和，预感到已经连降一天一夜大雨，险情就要跟踪而来，立即召开一次党小组扩大会，进行战斗前的紧急动员。“同志们，咱们那些黄泥路基……”，刘家和注视着暴雨，沉思一下接着说：“恐怕再也喝不进去了，说不定会出什么事，咱们……”，还没等他把话说完，突击队员们就异口同音的抢着向党表示决心：雨再大点怕什么，要是把路基给泡成泥，我们就用石渣把路基垫得更牢固。“对，同志们，我们不怕，不怕雨大黄泥粘，不怕水深石渣尖……”。刘家和刚说到这里，突击队长王起海就接过去说：“衣可湿透汗可流干，坚决不让高炉停产。”顿时，会场上响超一片热烈的掌声，有人提议把这四句话写在一张红纸上，敲锣打鼓给党支部送去。
    他们刚刚来到党支部，给十高炉运铁水、渣子的干线被水淹没的消息，竟跟踪传来了。他们放下决心书，转身就往回跑，来到现场一看，夹着线路的黄土陡壁己经滑落，线路压在黄泥底下。看到这种情景，每个人操起家伙，就一大筐、一大筐地把黄泥抬走。线路刚刚被清理出来垫牢，又有人来报告，给十高炉运焦炭、人造富矿的路基片帮下沉了。他们又分兵挥戈赶来险处，抢救十高炉的生命线。突击队长王起海，正在指挥抢卸石渣，充填沉下去的大坑，突然听到他家住的房子快被洪水冲倒的消息。自从大雨袭来，王起海己经两宿、三天没有回家了。王起海这时只是整着路基，要是不赶快修好，就不能给高炉运送原料。他听了这消息后，操起一把大铁锹抢卸石渣去了。王起海舍己为公的行为，感动得人们的心里热辣辣的，每个人都越战越有劲，路基下沉一毫米，马上就被垫高一毫米，他们一直坚持到雨住天晴。至于王起海的家，早就被运输部派人安置好了。
        翻山涉水修电路
    供应鞍钢全部电力的中心变电所，眼看就要被漫堤的洪峰包围了。鞍山供电局党委副书记谷万春、局长辛宝善和总工程师周来纯，带领一百多人前来抢救，很快使这个中心变电所转危为安。情况刚刚缓和，配电室又打来了电话：“通在弓长岭铁矿的高压线路中断了！”供电局党委马上召开了紧急会议，全局一二百多名干部、工人立即转到生产维护和电路抢修两条战线上进行战斗。党委决定：连夜派出五个巡线小队，对鞍山供电局管辖的每条线路进行逐线巡查和抢修。
    去弓长岭巡视线路的突击小队刚要出发，一位披着雨布上衣的老工人，气喘喘地跑来找党支部书记，要求让他也去参加巡线。他就是在这条线路上工作了七年多的老巡线站长、正在度假的鞍山电力学校学员邹学诗。他刚刚离开坚守四十多个小时的堤坝，到家还没等端起饭碗，听说“通往弓长岭线路中断了”，就连鞋也没顾得穿，三步并做两步，一气跑来。
    邹学诗等一行五人，在这雷雨交加的夜里，沿着通往弓长岭铁矿的输电线路，迅速而仔细的搜索前进。线路伸向山顶，他们跟着攀登山顶，线路走向深谷，他们跟着翻进深谷，线路跨过河流，他们也跟着涉过洪水。一路上，邹学诗为了解除大家的疲倦，不住嘴的讲解着这条线路的情况。党小组长喻春生，一再重念着刘支书嘱咐的话：“我们要拿出两万五千里长征的决心”，鼓舞着每个巡线队员。为抢前每一秒钟，谁也不肯怠慢一步，涉水跋山，奔驰了一天一宿，冲破了重重艰险和困苦，终于一清二白地把断线情况向工区领导做了详细汇报。
    工程处党总支书记李杰、主任耿世祥带领下的四十多名抢修队员，接到邹学诗小队的汇报之后，连夜赶到断线地点。队员们在二尺多深、半天拔不出脚来的淤泥中，从一里多路远的地方，把十来米高的电线杆子抬来，架起落地的高压线。经过十几个小时的奋战，被水冲倒的八根电线杆树立起来了。整整停电六十三个小时零三十分钟的弓长岭铁矿，又传出了有节奏的马达声。
    现在乌云散了，洪水低头了，鞍山上空又像往常一样，浓烟滚滚。抗击自然灾害、保卫鞍钢的各路英雄，早就返回原来的战斗岗位。他们正在用双倍的干劲，喝令矿山献出更多的矿粉，向高炉和平炉要更多的铁和钢。
