Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 26th: After thorough discussion by every vehicle and every person, the Chongqing Transportation Company has formulated its production increase and thrift plans and guarantee measures for the last four months of this year.

The Chongqing Transportation Company's production increase and thrift plan indicators were formulated after fully mobilizing the workers of each grassroots unit to carefully calculate the five areas for tapping potential. These five areas are: the current attendance rate of trailers can still be increased by about 20%; the current car repair rate can still be reduced by about 7%; by fully utilizing the current double-shift cars, more than thirty cars can be added each day; the current mileage utilization can still be increased by 10%; and the time for loading and unloading each ton of goods can be reduced by two minutes on the existing basis. In addition, based on the gap between the advanced and the backward, they carefully calculated accounts, formulated measures, and further unearthed the potential for increasing transport volume.

After carefully calculating accounts, all the company's workers were full of confidence and greatly increased their enthusiasm. They formulated production increase and thrift plans and specific measures, ensuring that every transportation point, every transportation line, every car, and every person had their own advanced and practical production increase and thrift plans, as well as specific measures to guarantee the realization of the plans. They immediately took action and launched a production increase and thrift competition. While discussing and formulating plans, the workers of the Fifth Motorcade took effective measures, with leading cadres, maintenance workers, and technicians jointly launching a crash effort to manufacture motorized trailers. Young driver Cheng Shaorong, while formulating a plan to learn from and catch up with advanced producer Chen Wantang, vigorously engaged in multi-towing and multi-hitching with his small Dodge car, creating a new record for the load carried by a small Dodge car. In response to the current shortage of tires, the Youth Tire Team vigorously "revived dead tires," repairing thirty-eight tires in just twenty-four hours, providing urgently needed tires for a batch of trailers.
