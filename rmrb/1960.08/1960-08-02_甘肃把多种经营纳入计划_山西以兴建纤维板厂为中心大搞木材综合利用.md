Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 1st. Gansu Province's industrial transportation and construction departments are incorporating diversified operations and comprehensive utilization into their production plans, to develop this work in a more planned way.

This year, Gansu Province's diversified operations and comprehensive utilization are mainly centered on increasing the production of raw materials, materials, and fuel. By the end of June, the province's metallurgical system had established eighty-four "small indigenous groups" and "small modern groups" factories, and twenty-one coal-to-oil plants. In addition, the construction, light industry, and forestry systems are vigorously engaged in diversified operations and comprehensive utilization, producing various products such as lime, cement, artificial marble, sawdust bricks, baked glue, soy sauce, aromatic oils, fiberboard, and plywood. This has not only created a large amount of wealth for the country but has also solved the difficulty of insufficient raw material supply to a certain extent.

However, in the past, due to the lack of overall planning by some units, they produced whatever they wanted in a piecemeal fashion, which limited these products from playing a greater role. The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed this situation, promptly summarized past experiences, and decided to incorporate diversified operations and comprehensive utilization products into the plan, so that the movement would not only blossom everywhere but also bear fruit everywhere. At present, each enterprise has focused on formulating plans for diversified operations and comprehensive utilization in the second half of the year. According to the statistics of the province's major factories and mines, more than seven hundred and sixty satellite factories will be built in the second half of this year, mainly producing steel, steel materials, pig iron, cement, bricks and tiles, mineral wool, alternative pit wood supports, fertilizers, paper, small hardware, and other products. The Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau and its directly affiliated Yongdeng Cement Plant, Construction Company, and other six enterprises have built forty-three satellite factories in Lanzhou, Tianzhu, and other places to produce steel, coke, refractory materials, cement, bricks, and tiles, striving to be basically self-sufficient in building materials starting from the fourth quarter, and to develop all construction enterprises into joint enterprises that produce a variety of building materials.

Incorporating diversified operations and comprehensive utilization into the production plan has many benefits. It is not only convenient to concentrate efforts on key breakthroughs around the main attack direction and key issues at different times to promote overall leap forward; it can also better utilize human and material resources, truly achieve that people do their best and materials are used to their full potential. At the same time, leaders can lead this work more meticulously, practically, and specifically through planning.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan. Shanxi Province is vigorously promoting the comprehensive utilization of wood, focusing on the construction of fiberboard factories. As of early July, the province had built two hundred and forty-eight fiberboard factories, with a daily production capacity of about twenty-five tons. At the same time, two hundred and twelve baked glue and rosin factories have been built in various places, producing more than forty-eight tons of baked glue and rosin. Many units have also trial-produced more than thirty new products, such as vinegar stone, wood flour, alcohol, artificial petroleum, magnesite boards, and plastics. This has increased the wood utilization rate in many areas from 65% to more than 95%, providing a large amount of raw materials for the development of the chemical industry.

In the work of comprehensively utilizing wood and building fiberboard factories, various places have generally implemented the principle of "mainly small-scale community-run, self-reliance, and combining indigenous and foreign methods." If there was no pulverizer, a weeding knife was used instead; if there was no beater, a stone roller was used. Finally, they broke through numerous difficulties, so that this new type of industry grew up rapidly and healthily.

### 甘肃把多种经营纳入计划  山西以兴建纤维板厂为中心大搞木材综合利用

    甘肃把多种经营纳入计划
    山西以兴建纤维板厂为中心大搞木材综合利用
    本报兰州1日电　甘肃省工业交通和建筑部门，把多种经营、综合利用纳入生产计划，使这项工作更有计划地发展。
    今年甘肃省多种经营、综合利用主要是以增产原料、材料、燃料为中心。到6月底，全省冶金系统办起“小土群”、“小洋群”工厂八十四个，煤炼油厂二十一个。此外，建筑、轻工和林业系统大搞多种经营综合利用，生产了石灰、水泥、人造大理石、锯末砖、烤胶、酱油、芳香油、纤维板、胶合板等多种产品。不仅为国家创造了大量财富，而且在一定程度上解决了原材料供应不足的困难。
    但是，过去由于有些单位缺乏统筹安排，想生产什么就生产什么，零敲碎打，这就限制了这些产品发挥更大的作用。中共甘肃省委分析了这一情况，及时总结了过去的经验，决定把多种经营和综合利用的产品纳入计划，使运动不但遍地开花，而且要遍地结果。目前，各企业已经有重点地制订了下半年多种经营和综合利用的计划。根据全省主要厂矿企业的统计，今年下半年还要办七百六十多个卫星厂，主要生产钢、钢材、生铁、水泥、砖瓦、矿渣棉、代用坑木支柱、化肥、纸张、小五金等多种产品。省建筑工程局及其直属永登水泥厂、建筑公司等六个企业，已在兰州、天祝等地兴建了钢铁、炼焦、耐火材料、水泥、砖瓦等四十三个卫星厂，争取从第四季度起，建筑材料基本自给，并使所有的建筑企业向着生产多种建筑材料的联合企业方向发展。
    把多种经营和综合利用纳入生产计划，好处很多，不但便于在不同时期围绕着主攻方向和关键问题，集中力量，重点突破，推动全面跃进；还能够更好地发挥人力物力的作用，真正做到人尽其才，物尽其用。同时，领导上通过计划就可以更细致、踏实、具体领导这项工作。
    据新华社太原电　山西省各地以兴建纤维板厂为中心，大搞木材综合利用。到7月上旬止，全省已建成纤维板厂二百四十八座，日产能力达到二十五吨左右。同时各地还建成烤胶厂、松香厂二百一十二座，共生产出烤胶和松香四十八吨多，还有不少单位试制成醋石、木粉、酒精、人造石油、菱苦土板、塑料等三十多种新产品。这样使许多地区的木材利用率，由过去的65％提高到95％以上，为化工工业的发展提供了大量的原料。
    各地在综合利用木材、兴建纤维板厂的工作中，普遍贯彻了“以社办小型为主，自力更生，土洋结合”的方针，没有粉碎机，就用锄草刀代替；没有打浆机，就用石碾碾，终于突破重重困难，使这一新型工业迅速茁壮地成长起来。
