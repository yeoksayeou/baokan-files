    Bulgaria's New Industrial Base
    In the fields of the Gotse Delchev region, northeast of Dimitrovgrad, Bulgaria, a new industrial base is rapidly under construction.
    Rich Treasures in the Fields
    Just over a year ago, the villages of Gotse Delchev and Troyanovo, northeast of Dimitrovgrad, Bulgaria, were still barren fields. However, Bulgarian and Soviet geologists discovered Bulgaria's richest coal deposits in this area. The first layer of coal is only a few meters below the surface. The third layer can be mined through open-pit mining. The second and third layers of coal are more than twenty meters thick in total. Therefore, the mining cost is very low. The mining area covers 21 square kilometers. It is estimated that the coal reserves in this mining area amount to 3 billion tons, accounting for about 80% of Bulgaria's total coal reserves.
    Future Industrial Town
    According to the decision of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government, the main projects of Bulgaria's Third Five-Year Plan have been launched on a large scale on this land. According to the plan, huge coal mines and power stations will be built here.
    By 1965, the "Troyanovo-1" and "Troyanovo-2" coal mines will produce 19 million tons of coal annually, which is equivalent to one and a half times Bulgaria's total coal production in 1958. Most of this coal will be converted into electricity. When the huge "Maritsa-East" power station is completed, its annual power generation will reach 3.85 billion kilowatt-hours. The "Rozov Kladenets" reservoir will become Bulgaria's first open-air cooling pool for thermal power plants. After the coal briquette factory here is completed, it will produce 1.8 million tons of coal briquettes annually.
    Rapid Pace of Construction
    The workers participating in the construction of this industrial base have demonstrated a high level of labor enthusiasm. The members of the "Kosta Dakev" team, who are responsible for metal structure work, are building sixteen large coal bins and thirty-two small coal bins. They excellently completed their production tasks with a quota of 320 percent. The members of this team are all excellent fitters, welders, and oxy-acetylene welders. The whole team is united and friendly and has become a model for the construction site.
    The Gotse Delchev region is rapidly changing its face. It will play an increasingly important role in Bulgaria's socialist construction.

### 保加利亚的新工业基地

    保加利亚的新工业基地
    在季米特洛夫格勒城东北哥勒保沃地区的田野上，保加利亚一个新的工业基地正在迅速地建设着。
    田野里的  丰富宝藏
    一年多以前，在季米特洛夫格勒城东北的哥勒保沃、特罗亚诺沃等村庄，还是一片光秃秃的田野。可是，保加利亚和苏联两国的地质学家在这个地区发现了保加利亚最丰富的煤藏。这里的第一层煤离地面只有几米。通过露天开采可以采到第三层。第二层和第三层煤共有二十多米厚。因此，开采成本很低。矿区面积达二十一平方公里。据估计，这个矿区的煤藏量达三十亿吨，占保加利亚全国煤藏量80％左右。
    未来的工业重镇
    根据保加利亚共产党中央和政府的决定，保加利亚第三个五年计划的主要工程已经在这片土地上大规模地展开了。根据计划，这里将要建设巨大的煤矿、发电站。
    到1965年，“特罗亚诺沃一号”和“特罗亚诺沃二号”煤矿全年将生产一千九百万吨煤，它相当于1958年保加利亚煤产总量的一倍半。这些煤大部分要变为电力。巨大的“马里查—东”发电站全部建成后，每年发电量将达三十八亿五千万度。“罗佐夫克拉德?茨”水库将成为保加利亚第一个热电站露天冷却池。这里的煤砖工厂建成后，每年将生产煤砖一百八十万吨。
    迅速的建设步伐
    参加建设这个工业基地的工人们，发挥了高度的劳动热情。担任金属结构工作的“科斯塔大哥”队的队员们正在建造十六个大型煤仓和三十二个小型煤仓。他们以百分之三百二十的指标出色地完成生产任务。这个队的队员们都是优秀的钳工、电焊工和氧焊工。整个队团结友爱，成了建筑工地的榜样。
    哥勒保沃地区正在迅速地改变着它的面貌。它将在保加利亚社会主义建设中发挥越来越大的作用。
