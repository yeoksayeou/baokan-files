    Plant as Much Late Autumn Crops as Possible; Abundant Autumn Harvests are Best
    Guangdong's Expansion of Autumn Grain Planting Gains More Momentum Than in Previous Years
    As of the 16th, Guangdong Province has sown 9.4 million mu of autumn harvested coarse grains such as sweet potatoes, corn, sorghum, millet, and mixed beans, an increase of 3 million mu compared to the same period last year. Currently, various localities are seizing the favorable opportunity after the rain to continue vigorously expanding the planting of coarse grains. Regions that have already completed their expansion plans have launched a second upsurge of rushing to plant coarse grains, striving for more planting and high yields to win a bumper late-season grain harvest this year.
    This year, the momentum, scale, and drive of Guangdong's expansion of coarse grain planting have greatly surpassed those of previous years. Not only is the planting early and the area large, but the quality is also better than in previous years.
    Jiangxi Seizes Rain to Rush Plant Coarse Grains
    People's communes in Jiangxi Province have taken advantage of the favorable post-rain opportunity to launch a concentrated effort to rush plant coarse grain crops. Currently, various localities are still in the midst of the planting upsurge.
    Since the beginning of August, there has been widespread welcome rainfall in various parts of Jiangxi Province, and the masses have shown great enthusiasm for rushing to plant. A few areas that have not received rain have also concentrated their efforts on fighting drought and rushing to plant. Ji'an County launched a large-scale "Expansion Week," mobilizing over 70,000 laborers for a concentrated effort, planting over 77,000 mu of sweet potatoes and soybeans in just two days.
    Shanghai Launches a Crash Campaign to Expand Late Autumn Planting
    The eleven suburban counties of Shanghai are racing against time and seizing the season, making full use of idle land to plant late autumn crops. As of the 15th, the counties have used early rice fields, double-season late rice seedling fields, and rapeseed seedling fields to plant over 110,000 mu of adzuki beans, mung beans, buckwheat, and late sweet potatoes.
    Before the start of late autumn crop planting, Party organizations in the suburban counties conducted "taking grain as the key link" education for the vast number of cadres and commune members through various meetings, helping everyone further clarify that grain is the foundation of the foundation, and it is imperative to use all available land to plant more and harvest more. On this basis, the communes quickly launched a crash campaign to plant late autumn crops on a large scale.
    Using Paddy Fields to Grow Carrots
    Chongxing Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, is seizing the great opportunity to fully utilize its experience of growing carrots in paddy fields over the past few years to plant carrots on a large scale. The Chongxing Commune sows carrot seeds in the rice fields before the rice is harvested. The yield is generally doubled compared to growing carrots in dry land, and half the fertilizer is saved, saving about ten workdays per mu. The Sichuan Daily published an editorial stating: This is a pioneering undertaking in developing agricultural production in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

    要闻快报
    尽量多种晚秋  秋收多多益善
    广东扩种秋粮声势胜过往年
    广东省到16日止已种下番薯、玉米、高粱、粟、杂豆等秋收杂粮作物九百四十万亩，比去年同期增加三百万亩。现在，各地抓紧雨后良机继续大力扩种杂粮；已经完成扩种计划的地区又掀起第二次抢种杂粮的高潮，力争多种、高产，夺取今年晚造粮食丰收。
    今年广东扩种杂粮的声势、规模和干劲都大大胜过往年，不但种得早、面积大，质量也比往年好。
    江西趁雨抢种杂粮
    江西省各人民公社已趁雨后有利时机突击抢种杂粮作物。目前，各地仍处在抢种高潮中。
    8月上旬以来，江西省各地普降喜雨，群众的抢种劲头很大；少数没有降雨的地区，也集中力量抗旱抢种。吉安县开展声势浩大的“扩种周”，出动七万多个劳动力突击，仅两天时间就抢种红薯、大豆七万七千多亩。
    上海掀起突击扩种晚秋运动
    上海市郊十一个县正在抢时间抓季节，充分利用空闲地大种晚秋作物。到15日止，各县已利用早稻田、双季晚稻秧田、油菜育秧田种下赤豆、绿豆、荞麦、晚山芋等十一万多亩。
    晚秋作物开始种植前，郊区各县党组织通过各种会议，向广大干部和社员进行了“以粮为纲”的教育，帮助大家进一步明确了粮食是基础的基础，一定要利用一切可以利用的土地多种多收。在这个基础上，各公社迅速掀起大种晚秋作物的突击运动。
    利用水稻坂田种胡萝卜
    四川郫县崇兴公社正抓紧大好时机，充分运用几年来利用水稻坂田种胡萝卜的经验，大种胡萝卜。崇兴公社在水稻收获前把胡萝卜种子撒在水稻田里，产量一般比在旱地种胡萝卜提高一倍，而且节省了一半的肥料，每亩地大约省十个工。四川日报发表社论说：这是多快好省地发展农业生产上的一项创举。
