	Science to the "Fang" is Very Good
		Jin Wen
	The emergence of large-area high-yield "fang" (squares or fields) is a major reform in farmland management and cultivation systems. It has completely changed the situation in the era of the individual economy where land was divided into small pieces and could not be reasonably managed and utilized. This huge change has raised a series of new issues, one of which is that science and technology must keep up.

	To develop agriculture at a high speed, it is necessary to systematically summarize and promote the experience of large-scale high yields; to study the scientific laws of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, and to promote new technologies in a timely manner, and so on. The measures taken by Tang County, Hebei Province, to bring science to the "fang" are a very good way to solve these problems.

	Science to the "fang" is an important way to combine cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers, and to combine science and technology with farmers' practical experience. Through guidance, teaching, learning, and research, it is not only conducive to further exploring the secrets of nature and adopting advanced scientific measures accordingly, but also to cultivating a large number of scientific and technological talents. Once the masses master science and can apply it to practice, they will become a powerful force for transforming the objective world. Tang County, with the "fang" field as a classroom, has enabled nearly 300,000 people to attend various science and technology lectures and 100,000 people to receive various professional training, and more than 100 people have become agricultural technology researchers in just six months. This fact powerfully illustrates the great significance of science to the "fang."

	As everyone knows, science comes from practice, and practice can enrich the treasure house of science and promote the continuous development of science and technology. Scientific research to the "fang" allows scientific and technical personnel to leave their offices and go deep into production practice for research and experimentation, which integrates the mass scientific research activities with the professional teams of agricultural scientific research work, brings experts and the masses together, and combines agricultural scientific theory with production practice, experimental research, and popularization. Agricultural scientific theory is tested through practice, and the long-term production experience of experienced farmers enriches agricultural scientific theory, which can continuously develop agricultural science.

	Science to the "fang" is a good method created by the masses to adapt to the new production situation, promote the rapid development of production, and promote the rapid development of scientific research work. It should be greatly promoted and widely popularized.

    科学到“方”好的很	津文
    大面积丰产方的出现，是农田的经营方式和耕作制度的一项重大改革，它彻底改变了个体经济时代把土地分割成小块，不能合理经营利用的状况。这一巨大的变革，提出了一系列的新课题，其中之一就是科学技术要跟上去。
    高速度发展农业，必须系统地总结、推广大面积的丰产经验；研究农业“八字宪法”的科学规律，并及时地推广新技术，等等。河北省唐县采取的科学到方的措施，则是解决这些问题的一个很好的办法。
    科学到方是使干部、技术员、老农相结合，科学技术与农民实际经验相结合的重要途径。通过指导、传授、学习、研究，不仅有利于进一步探索大自然的秘密，对症下药地采取先进的科学措施，还可以培养大量的科学技术人材。当群众一旦掌握了科学而又能运用到实践中去，就会成为改造客观世界的强大力量。唐县以方田为课堂，在短短的半年时间内，就使近三十万人听了各种科学技术讲座，十万人受了各种专业训练，一百多人成为农业技术研究员。这个事实，有力地说明了科学到方的巨大意义。
    大家知道，科学来自实践，通过实践可以丰富科学的宝库，推动科学技术不断向前发展。科学研究到方，使科学技术人员走出办公室，深入到生产实际进行研究试验，正是使群众性的科学研究活动和农业科学研究工作的专业队伍结成一体，使专家和群众打成一片，把农业科学理论和生产实践、试验研究和普及推广结合在一起。农业科学理论通过实践得到检验，老农多年来的生产经验又丰富了农业科学理论，这就可以使农业科学不断地得到发展。
    科学到方是适应新的生产形势，由群众创造出的一个推动生产迅速发展、推动科学研究工作迅速发展的好办法，应当大大提倡，广泛推广。
