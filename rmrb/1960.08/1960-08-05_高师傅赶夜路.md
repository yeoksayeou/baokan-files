    Master Gao Rushes on a Night Journey
    One evening in mid-July, a guest came to the Party Committee Office of the Ningbo Power Plant. He was wearing a bamboo hat and looked very anxious. Before he even stepped through the door, he blurted out, "Comrades, our water pump motor is making a buzzing noise and won't pump water!..." Old Zhang from the Party Committee Office, who was receiving the guest, quickly poured tea and offered him a seat, asking, "Comrade, where is the machine located? Take me to have a look."
      "In the countryside," the guest replied quickly.
    This presented a problem for Old Zhang because he was busy that evening and couldn't get away.
    Just then, Master Gao Defang arrived. He was an electrical operations shift worker and the leader of the plant's support-agriculture-anti-drought repair team. Every day after work, he would always go to the Party Committee, the Trade Union, and the Communist Youth League to see if there were any tasks to support agriculture. When Old Zhang saw Master Gao, he was overjoyed and immediately told him about the matter. Old Gao looked at his watch, it was already past six o'clock, and the last bus had already left. What to do? He thought: fighting drought is like fighting a fire, I must go, and get to Siming Mountain tonight!
    "Wait a minute!" Old Zhang thought of a good idea: "I'll borrow a motorcycle for you." With that, he ran to the Municipal Sports Association to borrow a motorcycle.
    Master Gao and the guest arrived in the countryside of Siming Mountain late at night on the motorcycle. As soon as they arrived, Master Gao hurriedly disassembled the motor and carefully checked it. He found that one of the three-phase power supplies was broken. If it wasn't repaired immediately, the motor coils would all burn out. Master Gao immediately started to solder the copper head. A little over an hour later, he turned on the motor switch, "Da, da, da..." The motor spun rapidly, and the iron dragon roared, water gushing out like a waterfall.
    Master Gao was warmly received by the commune members, and he rushed back to work at the plant early the next morning.

    高师傅赶夜路
    7月中旬的一天傍晚，宁波电厂党委办公室来了一位客人，头戴笠帽，神情十分焦急，脚还没有跨进门，就说开了：“同志，我们抽水机马达不知什么原因，老是嗡嗡地响，抽不出水来！……”接待这个客人的党委办公室老张连忙倒茶让坐，问他：“同志，机器放在什么地方，陪我去看一看。”
      “在乡下。”客人连忙回答。
    这一说可把老张难住了。因为今晚上有事，分不开身。
    正在这时，高德芳师傅来了，他是电气运行的值班工，又是厂里支援农业抗旱检修突击组组长，他每天一下班，总要到党委，工会、团委来，看有啥支援农业的任务，老张一见高师傅，真是喜出望外，立即把这事告诉了老高。老高一看手表，已六点挂另了，末班汽车已经开出，怎么办呢？他想：抗旱如救火，去，今晚连夜赶到四明山去！
    “慢走！”老张想了一个好办法：“我替你们借摩托车去。”说罢就跑到市体育协会去借摩托车。
    高师傅和客人乘着摩托车到四明山乡下时，已是深夜了。一到现场，高师傅就急忙拆开马达仔细检查，结果发现三箱电源，有一箱已经断了，若不马上修好，马达线圈就会全部烧掉。高师傅马上动手把铜头焊好。一个多小时后，他把马达开关一开，“哒，哒，哒……”马达飞快转动了，铁龙头大吼一声，水就像瀑布一样哗哗地喷了出来。
    高师傅受到社员的盛情招待，第二天清早又赶回厂上班了。
