    "Timing" and "Point of Attack"
    Yang Ling
    After going deep into the grassroots, what should we grasp? The most important thing is to grasp the key to the current production in the local area.
    What is the standard for doing a good job in leading production? The most important thing is to truly solve the key problems in the current production in the local area.
    To grasp the key, we must see the "timing," that is, accurately determine when doing something has a decisive impact on the overall production situation.
    To grasp the key, we must see the "point of attack," that is, accurately determine where and what kind of thing concentrating major efforts will have a decisive impact on the overall production situation.
    "Timing" and "point of attack" are not the same at any time or in any place, and cannot be accurately determined by standing on the sidelines and looking from a distance. Why do we advocate that cadres go deep into the front lines and participate directly in production? One of the most important reasons is that only in this way can we accurately determine the "timing" and "point of attack" of production at that time and in that place.
    Before going deep into the front line, we should have a clear purpose: to go down mainly to solve the key problems in current production. This is what the leading cadres of Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, did. There are many agricultural activities going on at the same time, and when they go down to participate in production, they participate in the current key production activities in the local area. When carrying out new work, obtaining advanced experience is key, so they go to places with better conditions and advanced work to participate in production and lead production. When promoting the balanced development of work, breaking through weak links is key, so they go to places with poorer conditions and more problems to participate in production and lead production. The overall situation is composed of many parts; leading cadres go separately into many parts to understand the commonalities and differences in the situations of various places. Through collective discussion and collective leadership, they can more accurately understand the key to the overall situation and more effectively promote the overall situation and guide the parts.
    There are keys within keys. From the scope of the whole province and county, a certain task is the main key; from the specific perspective of a commune or a production team, there are specific keys within the general keys. In special circumstances, the main key to the current production of a commune or a production team may not be the same as the main key of the whole province and county. The key to production in the whole province and county is field management of food crops, and a commune or a production team has its own focus in current field management, such as weeding, pest control, topdressing, watering, or drainage. In areas where cash crops are concentrated, the key to current production is different. In places where wind and flood disasters suddenly strike, the key must temporarily shift from field management to disaster resistance. And so on.
    According to the general situation of the county, the Jiangning County Party Committee of Jiangsu Province put forward the call to "strengthen field management with fertilizer accumulation and topdressing as the center." Many production teams in Tongshan Commune of this county had overgrown weeds or severe dehydration in the fields, but the commune leaders did not grasp the main key of the local area at that time for a period of time, but generally handled things in accordance with "fertilizer accumulation and topdressing as the center." After Li Chong, the first secretary of the county party committee, came to this commune, the first thing he did was to help them grasp the key. After investigation, they rearranged the labor force according to the seedling condition, weed condition, water condition, and drought condition of each team, and concentrated the main force to tackle the main key in the current production of the team. After the problems of weed infestation and dehydration were solved, the main force was concentrated on topdressing and fertilizer accumulation. Topdressing and fertilizer accumulation, according to the different seedling conditions and different sources of fertilizer, each team had different keys at different times, and the main force had to be used first on "three types of seedlings" and the largest amount of summer green fertilizer accumulation. Doing things like this is good leadership.
    Going down to the grassroots, "learning, doing, transferring, and helping," ultimately falls on the word "helping." "Learning, doing, and transferring" are mainly for the purpose of "helping" better. Otherwise, we cannot better exert our leadership role. We must go down to "find trouble" -- find the key from "trouble" and solve "trouble" problems. If we cannot play the role of "helping," or if we do not "help" well, then we can only "add trouble" to the grassroots, at most adding a labor force, and we will be far from the topic of improving leadership methods.
    Many comrades, after going deep into the front line, "learn" seriously, "do" vigorously, "transfer" thoughtfully, and "help" effectively. The reason is that in the process of "learning, doing, and transferring," they all grasp the key relatively clearly, and "help" at the right "timing" and "point of attack" -- that is, among the complex and varied contradictions that exist at the same time, they have captured the main contradiction that determines the overall situation at that time and in that place. Improving leadership methods is a core issue.

    “火候”和“刀口”
    杨岭
    深入基层以后抓什么？最要紧的就是抓当地当前生产中的关键。
    领导生产做得好的标准是什么？最重要的就是真正解决了当地当前生产中关键性的问题。
    抓关键就要看“火候”，也就是看准在什么时候做什么事情对于生产全局有决定性的影响。
    抓关键就要看“刀口”，也就是看准在什么地方什么事情上集中主要力量对于生产全局有决定性的影响。
    “火候”和“刀口”不是在随便什么时候、随便什么地方都是一个样子，并不是站在一边远远一望就能看准。为什么要提倡干部深入第一线，提倡干部直接参加生产呢？最重要的原因之一，就是只有这样才可能看准当时当地生产上的“火候”和“刀口”。
    深入第一线之前，就应该有明确的目的：下去主要是为了解决当前生产上的关键问题。河北吴桥县的领导干部就是这样做的。同时进行的农事活动很多，他们下去参加生产的时候就去参加当地当前关键性的生产活动。在开展新的工作的时候，取得先进经验是关键，他们就到条件较好、工作先进的地方去参加生产领导生产。在推进工作平衡发展的时候，突破薄弱环节是关键，他们就到条件较差、问题较多的地方去参加生产领导生产。全局是许多局部构成的；领导干部分头深入许多局部，了解各地情况的共同性和差异性，通过集体讨论、集体领导，就能更准确地了解全局的关键，更有力地推动全局、指导局部。
    关键之中还有关键。从全省全县范围来说，某一项工作是主要的关键；从一个公社一个生产队具体而论，在一般的关键之中还有具体的关键。在特殊情况下，一个公社、一个生产队当前生产的主要关键也可能同全省全县的主要关键并不相同。全省全县的生产关键是粮食作物的田间管理，一个公社、一个生产队在当前田间管理中又各有重点，或者是除草，或者是灭虫，或者是追肥，或者是浇水，或者是排水。在经济作物集中产区，当前生产关键又有不同。在风灾水灾突然袭来的地方，关键又要暂时从田间管理转到抗灾方面。如此等等。
    江苏江宁县委根据全县一般情况，提出了以“积肥、追肥为中心加强田间管理”的号召。这个县的铜山公社有不少生产队田间杂草丛生或者脱水现象严重，可是公社领导干部有一个时期没有抓住当地当时的主要关键，而是一般化地按照“以积肥、追肥为中心”办事。县委第一书记李崇同志到了这个公社以后，做的第一件事情就是帮助他们抓关键。他们经过调查，根据各队的苗情、草情、水情、旱情，把各队的劳动力重新作了安排，集中主力突击当前本队生产中的主要关键。草荒、脱水的问题解决了之后，再集中主力追肥、积肥。追肥和积肥，按苗情的不同、肥源的不同，各队不同时期又各有不同的关键，主要力量先要用在“三类苗”上和夏季最大量的沤青积肥上。像这样做，就是好的领导。
    到下面去，“学，干，转，帮”，归根结底还是落在“帮”字上。“学，干，转”，主要是为了更好地“帮”。不然，就不能更好地发挥领导作用。下去要“找麻烦”——从“麻烦”中找关键，解决“麻烦”问题。如果不能起“帮”的作用，或者“帮”得不好，那就只能给下面“添麻烦”，至多是给下面增加一个劳动力，也就离开了改进领导方法的本题。
    许多同志深入第一线之后，“学”得认真，“干”得起劲，“转”得周到，“帮”得有力。原因就是在“学，干，转”中间都比较明确地抓关键，“帮”得是“火候”，帮到了“刀口”上——也就是在同时并存的复杂纷纭的许多矛盾中，捉住了在当时当地说是决定着全局的主要矛盾。改进领导方法，这是一个核心。
