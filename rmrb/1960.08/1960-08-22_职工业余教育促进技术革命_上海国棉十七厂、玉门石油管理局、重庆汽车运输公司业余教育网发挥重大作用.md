Workers' Spare-Time Education Promotes Technological Revolution
Shanghai State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill, Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau, and Chongqing Automobile Transportation Company's Spare-Time Education Networks Play a Significant Role

    This newspaper reports that the worker's spare-time education at Shanghai State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill is constantly reforming its teaching methods according to the needs of the technological revolution and production development. The new teaching system has proven to serve production better after months of practice.
    Shanghai State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill has initially established a complete spare-time education system from primary school to junior high school, technical secondary school, and university. The total number of students enrolled in the factory is over 7,400, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of employees. Through spare-time education, the political, cultural, and technical level of workers has been greatly improved. Illiteracy among young and middle-aged people has been basically eliminated. The number of people who have reached the cultural level of higher primary school accounts for 58% of the total number of employees, those who have reached the level of junior high school account for 25.5%, and those who have reached the level of senior high school and university account for 12.5%. It has also cultivated a large number of cadres and technical personnel.
    Since the beginning of this year, the State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill has launched a massive technical innovation and technological revolution movement. This new situation of technological revolution requires workers to have an increasingly high level of cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge. In the future, whether they are maintenance workers, mechanics, or female weaving workers, they must have more and newer knowledge of electrical engineering, machinery, and modern physics. In order to meet this requirement, this factory has carried out the third reform this year on the basis of the past two teaching reforms.
    In order to unify the understanding of this teaching reform, the factory's Party committee mobilized spare-time school teachers to study the Party's education policy and conduct repeated discussions. On this basis, the Party committee also went deep into the workshops to investigate and hold forums to analyze and sort out the problems discovered. These problems were concentrated on issues related to mechanization, automation, and modern scientific knowledge. Workers demanded to learn this knowledge earlier and to learn it quickly and well. Therefore, the central requirement of this teaching reform is: starting from the needs of the technological revolution and the development of the textile industry, and the actual situation of textile workers lacking basic knowledge of physics, mechanization, and automation, according to the principles of quick results and learning for application, and according to the needs of professional and systematic improvement, determine the combination of cultural basic courses and professional courses, learn professional courses in advance, break the old teaching methods, and establish a new teaching system and teaching material system that meets the needs of the current and future development of the technological revolution.
    After detailed research and arrangement, the time for students to learn technical basic courses and professional courses can be greatly advanced. Originally, it would take six years to learn technical secondary school professional courses after becoming literate, which could not meet the urgent needs of production. Now, after one year of intensive study of the necessary cultural courses after becoming literate, they can begin to be exposed to technical basic knowledge, and they can learn professional courses after two years. The length of study from primary school to university can therefore also be appropriately shortened.
    This factory also adopted visualized and diversified teaching methods according to the characteristics of adults. When teaching technical basic courses and professional courses, they used locally-made teaching tools, wall charts, etc. closely combined with production. Sometimes they also held exhibitions and adopted on-site teaching, watching and operating, and explaining, which workers easily understood.
    The new teaching system and teaching methods can not only ensure teaching quality but also greatly reduce class hours and shorten the length of study. It can better serve production and the technological revolution. Through the teaching of various subjects, after workers learn various scientific and technological knowledge, they immediately apply it to the technological revolution and production. Therefore, there are more than 10,000 innovation suggestions, innovation projects, and examples of promoting production.
    This newspaper reports that Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau in Gansu Province has basically formed a relatively complete education system ranging from literacy to university, and from part-time to full-time, throughout the bureau. The bureau currently has one special class of the Petroleum College in a full-time university, 151 petroleum schools, technical schools, and Red and Expert schools, with a total enrollment of more than 37,000 people. In the past few years, the bureau has trained a large number of engineers and technicians from the workers, and the technical worker team has now expanded elevenfold.
    In the large-scale operation of worker spare-time education, Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau mainly adopted the methods of "grasping, distinguishing, and leading." Grasping means taking production as the center, making comprehensive arrangements, grasping production with one hand and education with the other, unifying leadership, unified arrangements, unified inspections, unified evaluations, and unified rewards for production and learning. Distinguishing means distinguishing right from wrong, explaining the truth, and eliminating ideological obstacles. For example, some people thought: "We can't even grasp production well, how can we have time to run schools?" and "Learning will affect production," and so on. In response to these ideological obstacles, the bureau's Party committee organized employees to discuss and find out the facts of some workshops and teams that both persisted in learning and overfulfilled production tasks, and solved ideological problems. Leading means that leaders persist in learning and lead the masses forward, and discover problems and solve problems through learning.
    Running schools at different levels and in diverse forms is a feature of Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau's large-scale operation of worker education. It adopted a five-level school-running form of bureau, factory, workshop, well, team, and group. The bureau and factory mainly focused on secondary vocational (high school) schools and spare-time universities, workshops focused on higher primary schools and junior high schools, and well teams and groups focused on literacy and attendance management. Running schools at different levels not only better combines unity and flexibility, popularization and improvement, but also enables leaders at all levels to be responsible at each level, divide up the work, strengthen leadership, and make learning more closely integrated with production.
    This year, in order to closely integrate technological innovation and technological revolution with technical and cultural education, the topics of innovation in each quarter are included in the teaching plan, and research and trial production are carried out in the form of lectures, discussions, and debates.
    This newspaper reports that Chongqing Automobile Transportation Company, according to the characteristics of the automobile transportation department's mobile and decentralized production, closely combined with production, adapted to people and local conditions, adopted diverse and flexible methods, and achieved remarkable results in running worker spare-time education on a large scale. At present, each team in the company has formed a mass spare-time learning network, and all 3,215 employees who should have been enrolled have been enrolled. Now, in addition to all the literate employees entering higher primary school classes, 1,040 people have been organized to enter junior high school and technical secondary school for study, and 144 people have entered college classes for study.
    One of the company's diverse and flexible teaching methods combined with production is to adopt the method of concentrated short courses at major stations and decentralized consolidation on the vehicle for drivers who drive single-vehicle, single-shift long-distance and have great mobility. Each team uniformly adjusts the route and takes turns to concentrate those who need to enter higher primary school or junior high school to study at a large point line (major station). During the concentrated study period, the trainees are assigned a night shift short-distance transportation task with double-shift transportation (that is, one person and one car, one shift a day, changed to two people and one car, two shifts alternating, non-stop day and night), and as much as possible take care of goods that can be loaded and unloaded quickly to ensure that they can return to their residence before 6:00 am the next day. For drivers who have shorter and more concentrated transportation distances, relatively fixed production tasks, and unified arrangement of transportation tasks in the form of driving groups, the method of teaching workers by workers (that is, workers teaching workers) is adopted, and a worker with good political quality, a higher level of education, and enthusiasm for teaching is selected or specially assigned as a part-time teacher in the driving group.
    Currently, 13 points in the company have set up a college class and a technical secondary school class respectively. Eight cadres and technicians with a university education have also been transferred as full-time teachers to form a mobile lecturer team, which is divided into three groups and three routes to be responsible for the teaching tasks of the technical secondary school and college classes, and give lessons to the learning classes on each route in sequence.
    Due to the improvement of the political, cultural, and technical level of workers, it has greatly promoted the technological revolution and the development of production. Since the beginning of this year, the company has realized 1,617 major innovations. (Attached image)

    职工业余教育促进技术革命
    上海国棉十七厂、玉门石油管理局、重庆汽车运输公司业余教育网发挥重大作用
    本报讯　上海国棉十七厂的职工业余教育，根据技术革命和生产发展的需要，不断进行教学改革。新的教学体系经过几个月的实践，证明它能更好地为生产服务。
    上海国棉十七厂已初步建立了小学、初中、中专和大学的一套完整的业余教育体系，全厂入学人数达七千四百多人，占职工总数的90％以上。通过业余教育，使职工的政治、文化、技术水平大大提高，青壮年文盲已基木扫除，达到高小文化程度的人数，占职工总数的58％，达到初中程度的占25.5％，达到高中和大学程度的占12.5％；并且培养了大量干部和技术人材。
    今年以来，国棉十七厂掀起了一个声势浩大的技术革新和技术革命运动。这种技术革命的新形势，要求工人有越来越高的文化科学技术水平。今后无论是保全保养工、机械工或者是挡车女工，都必须具备更多更新的电气、机械以及近代物理等知识。为了适应这一要求，这个厂今年在过去两次教学改革的基础上又进行了第三次改革。
    为了统一对这次教学改革的认识，这个厂党委发动业余学校教师学习党的教育方针，进行反复讨论。在这基础上，党委又深入车间调查摸底，召开了座谈会，把发现的问题进行分析排队。这些问题集中起来，主要是关于机械化、自动化和近代科学知识方面的问题。工人们要求提早学这些知识，并且要学得又快又好。因此，这次教学改革的中心要求是：从技术革命和纺织工业发展的需要和纺织工人缺乏物理和机械化、自动化基础知识的实际出发，根据速成的和学以致用的原则，按照专业和系统提高的需要，确定文化基础课和专业课相结合，提前学专业课，打破旧的教学方法，建立适应当前和今后技术革命发展需要的新的教学体系和教材体系。
    经过详细研究和安排，学员学习技术基础课和专业课的时间可以大大提前，原来脱盲以后要到第六年才能学到中专专业课，不能适应生产的迫切需要。现在，脱盲后经过一年突击学习必须的文化课以后，就开始接触到技术基础知识，两年后就可以学到专业课程；从小学到大学的学习年限因此也可适当缩短。
    这个厂还根据成人特点，采取形象化、多样化的教学方法，在教技术基础课和专业课的时候，运用了密切结合生产的土教具、挂图等。有时还举办展览会、采用现场教学，边看边操作、边讲解，工人听了容易理解。
    新的教学体系和教学方法，既能保证教学质量，又能大大减少课时，缩短修业年限，它能更好地为生产和技术革命服务。通过各科教学，工人们学到各种科学技术知识后，立即运用到技术革命和生产中去，因此提出的革新建议、搞成的革新项目和促进生产的事例，共有一万多件。
    本报讯　甘肃玉门石油管理局，在全局范围内己基本形成一个从扫盲到大学、从半日制到全日制的较完整的教育体系。全局现有全日制大学石油学院特别班一班，石油学校、技工学校和红专学校一百五十一所，入学人数共达三万七千多人。几年来，全局从工人中培养出了大批的工程师和技师，技术工人队伍现已扩大了十一倍。
    玉门石油管理局在大办职工业余教育中，主要采取了“抓、辨、带”的方法。抓，就是以生产为中心，全面安排，一手抓生产，一手抓教育，生产学习统一领导，统一安排，统一检查，统一评比，统一奖励。辨，就是辨清是非，讲明道理，消除思想障碍。如有的人认为：“生产还抓不过来，那有时间办学校”、“学习要影响生产”等等。针对这些思想障碍，局党委组织职工讨论，找出该局一些既坚持了学习，又超额完成了生产任务的车间、队组的事实，解决了思想问题。带，就是领导坚持学习，带领群众前进，通过学习发现问题，解决问题。
    分级办学，形式多样，是玉门石油管理局大办职工教育的一个特点。采取了局、厂、车间、井、队和班组五级办学形式，局、厂主要抓中等专业（高中）学校和业余大学，车间重点抓高小和初中，井队、班组抓扫盲和管学习出勤。分级办学不仅使统一性与灵活性、普及与提高更好地结合起来，而且使各级领导层层负责，分片包干，加强领导，使学习更加紧密地结合生产。
    今年为使技术革新和技术革命与技术文化教育紧密的结合起来，就将每季革新的课题列入教学计划，采取讲课、讨论、辩论等形式，进行研究试制。
    本报讯　重庆市汽车运输公司根据汽车运输部门生产流动分散的特点，紧密结合生产，因人因地制宜，采取多样灵活的方式，大办职工业余教育，取得了显著成绩。目前，全公司各车队已形成了一个群众性的业余学习网，三千二百一十五个应入学的职工全部入了学。现在，脱盲职工除全部进入高小班学习外，并组织了一千零四十人进入了初中和中专学习，还有一百四十四人进入了大专班学习。
    这个公司结合生产，多样灵活的教学方式之一，是对单车单班远程行驶，流动性很大的驾驶员，根据他们长期分散在外生产的特点，采取集中大站突击，分散车上巩固的办法。各车队统一调整线路，轮批把需要进入高小或初中学习的人集中在一个大的点线（大站）进行教学。集中学习期间给学员安排双班运输（即由一人一车，一日一班，改为两人一车，两班轮换，日夜不停）的夜班短程运输任务，并尽可能照顾能够快装快卸的货物，保证他们能在第二天清晨六点以前返回住地。对于运程较短、比较集中、生产任务较固定又以行车小组为单位统一安排运输任务的驾驶员，采取以工教工（即工人教工人）的办法，在行车小组中选择或专门调配一个政治质量好，文化程度较高和热心教学的工人作兼职教师。
    目前，全公司十三个点分别办了一个大专班和一个中专班。还抽调了八个具有大学文化程度的干部和技术人员作专职教师，组成流动讲师团，分为三个组三条线路包干负责中专和大专班的教学任务，给每条线路的学习班依序轮流上课。
    由于职工政治文化技术水平的提高，对技术革命和发展生产起了很大的推动作用。今年以来，全公司实现的较重大的革新就有一千六百一十七项。（附图片）
