A Communist Party Secretary's Notes

    The Fragrance of Wuyi Spreads Ten Thousand Miles
    Kang Tongjian, Secretary of the CPC Chong’an County Committee, Fujian Province

    The majestic and beautiful Wuyi Mountain not only adds to the grandeur of Chong’an County's landscape, but also provides abundant resources. In particular, the rich forests account for 67% of the county's mountains, forests, and farmland. Extensive stands of pine, fir, and miscellaneous trees grow amidst the endless mountains and ridges, with towering pines and lush greenery, forming a beautiful picture of red Chong'an, outwardly beautiful and inwardly wise, with all kinds of treasures.
    In the short decade since liberation, Chong’an has seen continuous development in agricultural production and the establishment of factories like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, presenting an infinitely beautiful picture before the people. The drums of the Great Leap Forward shook Wuyi Mountain, and the heroic sons and daughters, following the rhythm of majestic songs, strode forward with vigorous steps, eager to spread their wings and fly high, building a socialist new Chong’an at high speed. In every corner, people chatted happily about their lofty ambitions: male and female commune members fought against nature in the fields to achieve and exceed this year's grain production targets; tea-picking girls exchanged experiences with smiling faces, determined to increase the production of Wuyi tea year after year; pig-raising women also challenged each other, determined to raise the piglets fat and large... This atmosphere of heroic enthusiasm made continued leaps forward even more vibrant.
    Here, I would like to talk about a less well-known front: rosin. Many industrial sectors need it, but do you know how the people of Chong'an are fighting to dedicate more and better rosin to the country? The main raw material of rosin—pine resin—has a strong seasonality. Every year after the beginning of winter until before the beginning of summer, the climate is cold, and the pine resin easily solidifies, blocking the resin ducts and preventing flow. In reality, only half of the year is available for resin tapping. Last year, the resin tappers did not follow the old rules of “going up the mountain during Qingming and coming down during Frost’s Descent,” and most of them stayed on the mountain to tap resin, but each tree only yielded a few qian of oil per day.
    The season once attempted to restrain our leap forward with the "power" of nature, but the rosin workers overcame the cold time and again with their fiery enthusiasm. Noble aspirations inspired the rosin workers, who said in unison: if one tree produces little oil, we will open more trees. We must do everything possible to break through this barrier, to ensure that the off-season is not dull, and we will not leave the mountain without vowing to achieve high rosin production. At that time, several leading comrades of the county committee went deep into the resin tapping teams, organized cadres to take responsibility for specific areas, and worked with the workers to tackle this hurdle together. Party committees at all levels established secretary "experimental fields." The specific leadership of the Party inspired the communist spirit of the rosin workers, launching a powerful offensive against the old convention of "resin cannot be tapped in the cold season" with the force of a thunderbolt. Within a few days, the chemical resin tapping experiment of the Eighteenth Resin Tapping Team of the Wufu Branch was successful, and this team was the first to defeat the "stumbling block." Thin resin flowed steadily into the resin storage barrel, and the output increased by 30% compared to when no chemicals were used, achieving results comparable to the summer, the most suitable season for resin tapping.
    When the workers universally implemented the county committee's call to realize “chemicalization of resin tapping,” the new method of resin tapping was quickly promoted. During these days, people fought wits with nature with excitement and confidence. If one person had few ideas, everyone joined together to explore and work; if it was not successful once, they did not lose heart or become discouraged, but found the reasons and re-formulated the medicine... At this time, the Wu Changfa team of Mapo Ridge successfully experimented with indigenous chemical resin tapping. This good news was like a long rainbow that cut through the haze, making people suddenly enlightened. When the county committee held an on-site meeting, chemical resin tapping presented a scene of a hundred flowers blooming. The resin tappers, once they understood one thing, understood everything, and had become heroes controlling nature, increasing the resin tapping volume by one to two times. This good start greatly encouraged the masses' soaring enthusiasm. People further reformed resin tapping tools and transportation tools with inexhaustible power. Thousands upon thousands of difficulties were solved under the leadership of the Party, and one by one they were thrown far behind into the mountain streams, shattering them to pieces. The entire Wuyi Mountain was boiling.
    It was this strong will to reverse the situation that enabled the ambitious people of Chong'an and the rosin workers to create "re-repairing old scars and old openings," "one tree with multiple openings and multiple tubes," and other advanced experiences one after another after creating the chemical resin tapping method, as well as the advanced method of assembly line resin tapping. It was this drive to not give up until rosin production was captured that forced the pine trees standing proudly on the steep and rugged Wuyi Mountain to surrender to the intelligent working people, opening their mouths wide. Like waterfalls, they poured out pine resin with a special fragrant aroma. This flower of the Great Leap Forward is spreading its fragrance ten thousand miles with the east wind.

    武夷香花飘万里
    中共福建崇安县委书记　康通鉴
    巍峨秀丽的武夷山，给我们崇安县不仅增添了山川的壮观，而且提供了丰富的资源。特别是富饶的森林，占全县山林、农田面积的67％。成片的松木、杉木和杂木，丛生在绵延不绝的山岭之间，苍松参天，一片青葱翠绿，把红色的崇安，构成了一幅外秀中慧、万宝俱全的美丽图画。
    崇安在解放后短短的十年，农业生产连年发展，工厂的建立如雨后春笋，在人们面前展示出一幅无限美好的图画。大跃进的战鼓震撼了武夷山，英雄的儿女随着雄壮歌声的节奏，迈开矫健的步伐，要展翅高飞，高速度地建设社会主义的新崇安。每一个角落里，人们乐滋滋地纵谈着雄心壮志：男女社员们，在田头为了实现和超额实现今年的粮食生产指标同大自然奋战；采茶姑娘喜笑颜开地交流采摘经验，决心要叫武夷茶一年比一年增产；养猪的妇女们，也互相挑开了战，一心要把小猪养得又肥又大……。这种豪迈热情的气氛，使继续跃进，更加生气勃勃。
    这里我想谈一谈一个不太为人们熟知的战线：松香。许多工业部门都需要它，可是，你们是不是知道崇安的人们怎样在为向国家献上更多更好的松香在战斗着呢？松香的主要原料——松脂生产的季节性很强，每年立冬后至立夏前，气候寒冷，松脂容易凝固，脂沟阻塞就流不出来了，一年中实际只有半年时间可以采脂。去年，采脂工人没有按照“清明上山，霜降下山”的老规矩办事，大部分留在山上采脂，但一株树一天只流几钱油。
    季节，曾经企图用自然的“威力”束缚我们的跃进，而松香工人却以火热的心情战胜了一次次的严寒。崇高的意愿，鼓舞着松香工人，他们众口一声地说：一株树出油少，我们多开几株，要想尽一切办法，冲破这道关，使淡季不淡，不夺松香高产誓不下山。那时候，县委几个领导同志都深入到采脂组，组织干部分片包干，和工人共同突击这个关，各级党委都建立书记“试验田”。党的具体领导鼓舞了松香工人的共产主义风格，以雷霆万钧之势，向“严寒季节不能采脂”的老常规，发起了强大的攻势。几天时间，五夫分厂第十八采脂组的化学采脂试验成功了，这个组首先击垮了“拦路虎”。稀稀的脂液，源源地流入储脂筒，产量比没有使用药剂的时候提高了30％，取得了与最适宜采脂的夏季不相上下的成绩。
    当工人普遍贯彻县委提出实现
  “采脂化学化”的号召后，新的采脂的办法，很快地推行开来了。在这些日子里，人们怀着激动的心情和必胜的信念同自然斗智。一个人的点子少，大伙儿合起来摸索着干；一次不成功，不灰心不气馁，找原因，又重新配药……。这时，马婆岭的吴昌发小组，试验成功了土法化学采脂。这个喜讯像割破了阴霾的长虹，使人豁然开朗。当县委开现场会议时，化学采脂呈现出百花争艳的局面。采脂工人们一窍通百窍开，已经成为支配着自然的英雄，把采脂量提高一倍到两倍，这个良好的开端，给群众的冲天干劲以莫大鼓舞。人们进一步以无穷无尽的力量，改革了采脂工具和运输工具。千千万万个困难，都在党领导下的英雄人民面前，迎刃而解，一个个被远远地甩在身后的山涧里，摔得粉碎。整个武夷山沸腾起来了。
    就是这股扭转乾坤的坚强意志，使得怀着雄心壮志的崇安人民和松香工人，在创造了化学采脂法之后，接二连三地创造了“重修老疤老口”，“一树多口多筒”等先进经验，和流水作业采脂的先进方法。就是这股不夺取松香生产、誓不罢休的干劲，迫使傲然屹立在峻拔嶙峋的武夷山上的松树，在富有智慧的劳动人民面前，甘拜了下风，张开了大口。瀑布般倾吐出含着特有清香味道的松脂。这朵大跃进之花，正随着东风，散发出万里清香。
