    "Two-Five System" Leadership Method Promotes Cadre Theoretical Study
    Ying Lin
    The "two-five system" leadership method advocated by the Wuqiao County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province scientifically arranges cadres' labor, work, and study, ensuring that cadres have time to study theory and current affairs policies, and making cadre theoretical study regular and institutionalized. It also closely integrates going deep into reality with studying and researching work, better implementing the principle of linking theory with practice, thereby effectively improving cadres' theoretical and policy level. Facts have proven that the "two-five system" leadership method is a good way to quickly cultivate and improve cadres.

    Study and work are a dialectical unity. To effectively implement the Party's policies and work effectively for the Party and the people, a Party member and cadre must regularly and conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Chairman Mao. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the development of productive forces has been very rapid, requiring the relations of production and the superstructure to also change accordingly. The people's commune is a new thing that has emerged as the relations of production adapt to the development of productive forces. As productive forces continue to develop, the organizational form and management system of the people's commune must also be continuously improved. Improving cadres' leadership style and leadership methods is an important aspect of this. This further necessitates strengthening cadres' theoretical study, improving their understanding of the laws of socialist construction, and enhancing their consciousness in implementing policies, so that they can proactively and regularly improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, and between leaders and those being led. Therefore, Party committees at all levels attach great importance to cadre theoretical study, further improve the study system, and strengthen leadership over study, resulting in a relatively significant improvement in cadres' theoretical and policy level. However, because some issues related to cadre study have not been thoroughly resolved, cadre theoretical study is still not regular enough, a phenomenon that is particularly prominent in agencies below the county level. According to statistics from the Wuqiao County Committee of the Communist Party of China, before the implementation of the "two-five system" leadership method, only 30% of cadres detached from production in the county were able to regularly adhere to theoretical study, and 20% studied intermittently. Moreover, the reason why these cadres were able to study was because they spent more time in the agencies. As for leading cadres, cadres who frequently went to the countryside, and cadres in the management areas, they had little or no time to study. The existence of this phenomenon is related to the insufficient understanding of the importance of theoretical study by some cadres, but there are also objective reasons. The main reason is the lack of a relatively scientific arrangement of labor, work, and study. There are many specific matters to be dealt with on a daily basis, as well as many meetings, documents, and reports, which often leave many comrades in a busy and chaotic state, unable to finish one day's work in a single day, making it difficult to find time to sit down and read a book properly.

    How can we regularize the theoretical study of cadres in service?

    The "two-five system" leadership method has solved this problem relatively well. It fixes cadre study as a system, stipulating that each cadre must study one day a week. This regulation is not made in isolation, but is the inevitable result of a scientific arrangement of cadres' labor, work, and study. That is to say, if this leadership method does not prominently solve the problem of how to go deep into reality and the masses, and lead production through participation in production, so that many problems in production and work are solved in a timely manner at the lower levels, thereby greatly reducing meetings, documents, and reports, and allowing cadres to jump out of the circle of事務主義 and 文牘主義, it would be difficult to guarantee one day a week for study. This is indeed the case. In the past few months, as the Wuqiao County Committee of the Communist Party of China has continuously summarized the experience of cadres participating in production and leading production, and vigorously improved the way meetings are held, it has generally ensured that the county committee solves the problems that need to be resolved through meetings on Mondays and the commune party committee on Tuesdays, and arranges the work for the week, thereby ensuring that cadres have time to go deep into reality and that cadres have time to study every week. It also ensures that most cadres can truly settle down and study when it is time to study. According to statistics, among the more than 4,500 cadres in the county, more than 4,350 regularly participate in study, accounting for about 95% of the total number of cadres. The remaining 5% or so of cadres are mostly unable to participate in study due to illness or being away.

    The implementation of the "two-five system" leadership method also plays a significant role in improving the quality of study. In the past, because the study time was not unified, cadres generally studied separately. Although the county committee uniformly stipulated the study content and progress, it was difficult to achieve complete uniformity in the actual implementation of the study progress. Inconsistent study times, inconsistent study progress, and the scattered nature of the countryside made it difficult for theoretical work cadres to go deep into guidance, even though the guidance forces for study have been strengthened this year. Therefore, the quality of study was not easily guaranteed. After the implementation of the "two-five system" leadership method, because there is a unified study time for both the upper and lower levels (in order to avoid the upper and lower levels being disconnected in the deployment of work and holding repetitive meetings, the Wuqiao County Committee stipulates that county-level agencies hold meetings on Mondays to study work and study on Tuesdays; communes and management areas study on Mondays and hold meetings on Tuesdays to study work), cadres can be concentrated and study according to a unified progress. Wuqiao County's approach is: every Tuesday, cadres who remain in county-level agencies concentrate in their respective agencies for study; every Monday, cadres in communes and management areas who are detached from production, as well as cadres in the county who are assigned to fixed teams in the countryside, go to the commune for collective study. Cadres who work in the countryside but are not assigned to fixed teams participate in commune study or return to the county for study depending on the situation. Since the beginning of this year, cadres throughout the county have studied "On Practice" and the three major documents on commemorating Lenin, and are now studying "On Contradiction" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." The weekly study content and progress are uniformly stipulated by the Propaganda Department of the county committee, and unified study outlines are printed and distributed.

    What are the benefits of concentrating cadres and studying according to unified content and progress? First, it is convenient for study guidance. During the weekly study time, the theoretical instructors of each commune must provide a study guidance report to the cadres before or during the study, based on the principle of linking theory with practice. On this day, the cadres of the Theoretical Teaching and Research Office of the Propaganda Department of the county committee also go deep into the areas contracted by each person to provide guidance or check on the study situation. Every Monday evening, the Theoretical Teaching and Research Office of the Propaganda Department of the county committee also broadcasts a study guidance report to cadres throughout the county, which is organized by each unit for everyone to listen to. Second, it is convenient to organize study discussions. After each study, cadres in each commune study on their own in a concentrated manner and listen to guidance reports. They then discuss in groups by management area. The commune party secretary generally participates in the group of the management area they are responsible for, which strengthens leadership over study discussions. At the same time, because there are more people in the group and the topics discussed are related to theory and practice, the speeches are generally very enthusiastic, which can inspire each other and greatly help each comrade deeply understand the spirit and essence of the documents and solve problems in their thinking and work. In the past, during decentralized study, because there were very few people participating in each unit and there was no guidance, it was more difficult to organize discussions. Even if discussions were organized, they often failed to take off. Third, leading cadres of each unit were often unable to participate in study due to busy work, and had less control over cadre study. After the implementation of the "two-five system," they not only study together with the cadres, but also strengthen leadership over cadre study and personally provide guidance reports. For example, the Chengguan Commune Party Committee holds a standing committee preparatory meeting every Sunday evening to study the content of the Tuesday meeting and make arrangements for the Monday study. The party secretary often takes the lead in grasping the theoretical study guidance report and studying the key points of the lecture with the theoretical instructors, studying how to link the content of the lecture with the current production and the thinking of cadres and the masses. As of now, 58 of the 149 party secretaries and township heads of each commune in the county have personally given study guidance reports to cadres, and some comrades have given more than two reports. These factors combined have greatly improved the quality of cadre theoretical study in Wuqiao County. Not long ago, a county-wide "On Practice" study test was conducted, and the general results reached an excellent level.

    Theory must be linked to practice, and study must adopt a targeted attitude. This is generally understood by our comrades. However, how theory is linked to practice, especially how to organically combine study and work, is a problem that many people have not yet solved well. The implementation of the "two-five system" leadership method provides cadres with time to go deep into reality and time to study and research work, opening up new avenues for solving this problem. For more than four months, according to the provisions of the "two-five system" leadership method, the vast majority of cadres in Wuqiao County, from the county party secretary to the management area cadres, have gone deep into the front line for five days a week. In the process of going deep, they have adopted the methods of learning, doing, transferring, and helping, and have participated in production to lead production. In this way, the new situations, new problems, and new experiences reflected from practice are much richer than in the past. By concentrating them, the instructors can provide study guidance reports, which can better target the actual situation of current production and work, and the actual situation of the thinking of cadres and the masses. During the study process, cadres can also raise the problems they encounter at the lower levels and analyze and study them together to raise them to the height of theoretical policies for understanding. Throughout the entire study process, emphasis is placed on the unity of learning and application, and learning serves politics and production. Everyone is called upon to find contradictions, solve contradictions, and compete to see who thinks about more problems, proposes more solutions, and solves more problems. After each study phase, larger-scale discussion meetings are held, typical speeches are organized, study tests are held, and writing study心得 is encouraged. By closely linking theory with practice and closely linking learning, speaking, writing, and using, the people who study not only easily understand the spirit of the documents, but also can immediately use what they have learned to guide current production and work, achieving immediate results.

    Taking the example of cadres in Chengguan Commune studying the two worldviews and the universality of contradiction lesson. At that time, the county was in a severe drought, and the Party Committee arranged for a campaign to replant spring seedlings and rush to summer sowing, but cadres and the masses had two different attitudes: the vast majority of comrades were full of energy, took active actions, and tried every means to find water sources and tap labor potential; a few people were pessimistic and disappointed, and one-sidedly emphasized objective difficulties. When the theoretical instructor gave a study guidance report, he gave an easy-to-understand explanation targeting this situation, explaining that we want to strive for a great harvest in agriculture, but the sky does not rain, which affects the sowing work and the growth of crops. This is the main contradiction in current agricultural production. The two different attitudes towards this contradiction reflect people's different worldviews. The former have a clear dialectical materialist worldview, understand the truth that things are done by people and that people can conquer nature. They firmly believe that as long as people's subjective initiative is fully utilized and objective laws are respected, they will be able to overcome the drought and solve this contradiction. The latter have not yet fully established a dialectical materialist worldview. Not only is their way of thinking one-sided, only seeing the difficulties and not seeing the favorable conditions; but also they see things but not people, so they are intimidated by objective difficulties. After the theoretical instructor's explanation and group discussions, the people who participated in the study not only understood what is contradiction and what is worldview, but also helped some comrades overcome their negative and fearful emotions, and strengthened their belief that people can conquer nature. After the cadres returned, they immediately mobilized the masses to come up with ideas and methods, and quickly set off a climax of drought resistance and sowing in the whole commune, increasing the number of wells dug daily from fifteen to thirty, and increasing the number of drought-resistant planting from 2,000 mu to 3,000 mu per day.

    In the past, some comrades among cadres, especially grassroots cadres, could only do work but were not good at summarizing experience. The basic reason is that their ability to analyze and understand things is relatively poor. Since the implementation of the "two-five system" leadership method, this phenomenon is rapidly changing among cadres in Wuqiao County. Through study, many comrades have been able to raise the issue of improving leadership style and leadership methods to the height of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and treating people equally, and have proactively examined and improved their leadership style and leadership methods. Tian Yufu, the party general branch secretary of Zhaobai Management Area of Qinglan Commune, always had the final say because he had a set of work experience. Last year, when accumulating fertilizer for wheat planting, some people suggested that quantity and quality should be given equal importance, but he emphasized quantity. As a result, a lot of sandy fertilizer was accumulated, but it could not be used in the wheat fields, which affected the growth of wheat. Since studying "On Practice," he has realized that doing things based solely on one person's subjective ideas will inevitably run into obstacles. This spring, when watering wheat and spring sowing were crowded together, he timely convened a meeting of the village branch secretaries and production team leaders to study and solve this contradiction with the collective wisdom. Both tasks were completed very well. The general reflection of the people is: through studying theory, their minds have become clearer, their eyes have become brighter, they have discovered more problems, solved them in a timely manner, summarized more experiences, and promoted them quickly. According to incomplete statistics from the County Committee Office, in the three months since the implementation of the "two-five system" leadership method, more than 190 relatively significant experiences have been summarized in the county. Not only has the quantity increased, but the quality has also improved. After being promoted throughout the county (some have been promoted throughout Tianjin City and Hebei Province), it has greatly promoted production and work.

    “二五制”领导方法促进了干部理论学习
    应麟
    中共河北省吴桥县委倡导的“二五制”领导方法，在科学地安排干部的劳动、工作和学习的基础上，保证了干部有时间学习理论和时事政策，使干部理论学习达到了经常化、制度化；又把深入实际和通过学习研究工作密切地结合了起来，更好地贯彻了理论联系实际的方针，从而有效地提高了干部的理论政策水平。事实证明，“二五制”领导方法是迅速培养和提高干部的好办法。
    学习和工作是辩证的统一，一个党员、干部要很好地贯彻执行党的方针政策，有效地为党和人民工作，就必须经常地认真地学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席著作。特别是1958年大跃进以来，生产力的发展非常迅速，要求生产关系和上层建筑也必须相应地改变，人民公社就是生产关系适应着生产力的发展而出现的新生事物。而生产力在继续发展，为了适应生产力发展的需要，人民公社的组织形式和经营管理制度也必须不断地完善；改进干部的领导作风和领导方法，就是其中一个重要的方面。这就更加需要加强干部的理论学习，提高他们对社会主义建设规律性的认识，提高他们对执行方针政策的自觉性，使他们能够主动地经常地改进干部和群众、领导和被领导之间的关系。因此，各级党委对干部理论学习极为重视，进一步健全了学习制度，加强了对学习的领导，使干部的理论政策水平有了比较显著的提高。但是，由于有关干部学习中的一些问题没有彻底解决，干部的理论学习仍然不够经常，这种现象特别在县以下机关中比较突出。据中共吴桥县委统计，在实行“二五制”领导方法以前，全县脱离生产的干部能够经常坚持理论学习的只占30％，学习时断时续的占20％。而且这些干部所以能够学习，还是因为他们在机关的时间比较多，至于领导干部、经常下乡的干部和管理区的干部，就很少甚至根本没有时间学习。这种现象的存在，固然同一些干部对理论学习的重要性认识不够有关，但是也确有客观原因。主要是对劳动、工作和学习缺乏比较科学的安排，日常要处理的具体事务很多，会议、文件和表报也很多，因而使许多同志经常处于忙忙乱乱之中，一天的事一天还办不完，当然也就很难有时间坐下来好好地读一点书。
    怎样才能使在职干部的理论学习经常化呢？
    “二五制”领导方法比较妥善地解决了这个问题。它把干部学习作为一项制度固定下来，规定每个干部每周必须学习一天。这个规定不是孤立地作出来的，而是科学地安排了干部的劳动、工作和学习的必然结果。这就是说，这个领导方法如果没有突出地解决了如何深入实际和深入群众，通过参加生产领导生产的问题，使生产和工作中的许多问题在下面就及时解决，从而大大地减少了会议、文件和表报，使干部跳出了事务主义和文牍主义的圈子，一周学习一天的时间就很难保证。事实正是这样。几个月来由于中共吴桥县委不断地总结了干部参加生产领导生产的经验，大力地改进了会议的开法，一般地做到了县委在星期一、公社党委在星期二就把需要通过会议解决的问题解决了，把一周的工作安排好了，因而既保证了干部有时间深入实际，也保证了干部每周学习的时间，而且使大多数干部到了学习时间真正能够安下心来学习。据统计，全县四千五百多名干部，经常参加学习的达四千三百五十多名，占干部总数的95％左右，其余5％左右的干部，大部分是因病休养和外出不能参加学习。
    实行“二五制”领导方法，对于提高学习质量也有很大作用。过去由于学习时间不统一，干部一般是分散学习，虽然县委统一规定了学习内容和进度，但是实际执行起来，还是很难作到学习进度完全统一。学习时间不一致，学习进度不统一，农村又很分散，虽然今年以来学习的辅导力量加强了，但是理论工作干部仍难深入辅导，因而学习的质量也就不易保证。实行“二五制”领导方法以后，由于上下都有了统一的学习时间（为了避免在部署工作上上下脱节，不开重复的会议，吴桥县委规定，县级机关星期一开会研究工作，星期二学习；公社和管理区星期一学习，星期二开会研究工作），就可以把干部集中起来，按照统一的进度学习。吴桥县的作法是：每逢星期二，县级留机关的干部各自在本机关集中学习；每逢星期一，公社和管理区的脱离生产的干部以及县里下乡固定包队的干部都到公社集体学习，县里下乡工作但不固定包队的干部，则视情况参加公社学习或回县学习。今年年初以来，全县干部已经学习了《实践论》和关于纪念列宁的三大文件，现在正学习《矛盾论》和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。每周的学习内容和进度，都由县委宣传部统一规定，并且印发了统一的学习提纲。
    把干部集中起来，按照统一的内容和进度学习，有什么好处呢？第一，便于学习辅导。在每周的学习时间内，各公社的理论教员都要根据理论联系实际的方针，在学习前或学习中对干部作一次学习辅导报告。在这一天，县委宣传部理论教研室的干部也按各人分工包干的片深入下去作辅导，或检查学习情况。每个星期一的晚上，县委宣传部理论教研室还通过广播，对全县干部作一次学习辅导报告，由各单位组织大家收听。第二，便于组织学习讨论。每次学习，各公社干部在集中自学和听辅导报告以后，都以管理区为单位分组讨论，公社党委书记一般都参加他们所包的管理区的小组，这就加强了对学习讨论的领导；同时还因为小组的人数较多，讨论的又是理论联系实际的题目，所以发言一般都很热烈，可以互相启发，对于帮助每个同志深入地领会文件的精神和实质，解决思想和工作上的问题大有帮助。而在过去分散学习的时候，因为每个单位参加的人很少，又没有人辅导，就比较难于组织讨论，即使组织了讨论，也往往讨论不起来。第三，各单位的领导干部，过去常因工作繁忙而不能参加学习，对干部学习管得也比较少；实行“二五制”以后，他们不但和干部一起学习，而且加强了对干部学习的领导，还亲自作辅导报告。例如，城关公社党委在每个星期日的晚上召开常委预备会议，研究星期二的会议内容，并对星期一的学习作布置。而且经常由党委书记抓理论学习辅导报告，和理论教员一起研究讲课重点，研究如何使讲课内容和当前的生产和干部群众的思想联系起来。截至目前，全县各公社一百四十九名党委书记和乡长，已有五十八名亲自给干部作过学习辅导报告，有的同志还作过两次以上。这几方面的因素集中起来，就使吴桥县干部理论学习的质量大大提高。不久以前，全县普遍地进行了一次《实践论》学习测验，一般的成绩都达到了优良的程度。
    理论必须联系实际，学习必须采取有的放矢的态度，这是我们的同志一般都懂得的；但是理论怎样联系实际，特别是怎样使学习和工作有机地结合起来，这个问题许多人就还没有很好地解决。实行“二五制”领导方法，既使干部有了深入实际的时间，又有了学习和研究工作的时间，就为解决这个问题开辟了新的途径。四个多月来，按照“二五制”领导方法的规定，吴桥县每周有五天的时间，从县委书记起直到管理区干部，绝大多数都深入到第一线，而在深入的过程中，又采取学、干、转、帮的方法，通过参加生产领导生产。这样，从实际中反映出来的新情况、新问题和新经验比过去丰富得多了，把它们集中起来，教员作学习辅导报告，就能更好地作到有的放矢，更加密切地结合当前生产和工作的实际、干部和群众思想的实际来讲解。而干部在学习过程中，也可以把自己在下面碰到的问题提出来，通过大家共同分析研究，提到理论政策的高度加以认识。而在整个学习过程中，又强调学用一致、学习为政治和生产服务，号召人人寻找矛盾、解决矛盾，比赛谁想的问题多，提出的办法多，解决的问题多。每个学习阶段结束以后，还召开较大型的讨论会，组织典型发言，举行学习测验，提倡写学习心得。这样把理论和实际紧密地联系起来，把学、讲、写、用紧密地结合起来，学习的人不但容易领会文件的精神，而且可以把学到的东西立即用于指导当前的生产和工作，收到立竿见影的效果。
    以城关公社干部学习两种宇宙观和矛盾的普遍性一课为例。当时正值全县处于干旱严重的时期，党委布置突击补种春苗和突击夏播，而干部和群众中却有两种不同的态度：绝大多数同志干劲十足，积极行动，千方百计地找水源和挖劳动潜力；少数人则悲观失望，片面地强调客观困难。理论教员在作学习辅导报告时，就针对这种情况作了通俗易懂的讲解，说明了我们要争取农业大丰产，而老天不下雨，影响着播种工作的进行和农作物的生长，这就是当前农业生产上的主要矛盾，对于这个矛盾的两种不同态度，就反映了人们不同的宇宙观。前一种人有明确的辩证唯物主义的宇宙观，懂得事在人为、人定胜天的道理，他们坚信只要充分发挥人的主观能动性，又尊重客观规律，就一定能够战胜干旱，解决这个矛盾。而后一种人则还没有完全树立起辩证唯物主义的宇宙观，不仅思想方法片面，只看到困难的一面，看不见有利条件；而且见物不见人，所以被客观困难吓倒了。经过理论教员这样讲解和分组讨论，参加学习的人不但懂得了什么是矛盾，什么是宇宙观，而且帮助一部分同志克服了消极畏难情绪，使他们坚定了人定胜天的信念。干部们回去以后，立即发动群众出主意想办法，很快就在全社掀起了一个抗旱播种的高潮，使全社由日打井十五眼增加到三十眼，抗旱点种由日进两千亩增加到三千亩。
    过去，在干部、特别是基层干部中，有些同志只会做工作而不善于总结经验。基本原因是分析认识事物的能力比较差。自从实行“二五制”领导方法以来，这种现象正在吴桥县的干部中迅速地改变着。不少同志通过学习，已经能够把改进领导作风和领导方法的问题，提到这是相信群众、依靠群众和以平等待人的原则高度来认识，主动地检查改进了自己的领导作风和领导方法。青兰公社赵柏管理区党总支书记田玉甫，因为有一套工作经验，一向总是自己说了算。去年种麦积肥时，有人提出应该数量与质量并举，他却强调数量。结果沙肥积得不少，可是用不到麦地里，影响了小麦生长。自从学习了《实践论》，他认识到只凭一人的主观想法办事必然碰钉子。今春浇麦和春播挤在一起时，他就及时召开各村支部书记和生产队长会议研究，用集体的智慧解决了这个矛盾，两项任务都完成得很好。人们的普遍反映是：通过学习理论，头脑更加清醒了，眼睛更加明亮了，问题发现得多，解决得及时，经验总结得多，推广得快。据县委办公室不完全统计，在实行“二五制”领导方法的三个多月中，全县总结出来的比较重大的经验就有一百九十多条，不但数量增加了，而且质量提高了，在全县推广后（有一部分在全天津市和全河北省推广），对生产和工作起了很大促进作用。
