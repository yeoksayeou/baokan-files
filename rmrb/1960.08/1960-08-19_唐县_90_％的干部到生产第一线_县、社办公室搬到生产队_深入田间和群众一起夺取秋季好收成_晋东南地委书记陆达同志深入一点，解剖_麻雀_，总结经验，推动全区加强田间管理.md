Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 18th. The Tang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province, grasping the crucial period for seizing the autumn harvest, has adopted resolute and thorough measures, drawing 90% of its cadres to delve into the front lines of production and moving all county and commune offices and departments to production teams, working hard for four months to win a complete victory in the autumn harvest and autumn planting.

Since implementing the "two-five system" working method, the county's leadership style has greatly improved, with a large number of cadres going deep into the production front lines to participate in and lead production. However, this was not fully adapted to the task of seizing a large autumn harvest. For example, some offices were still located above, which inevitably constrained a group of cadres from going deep into reality. To solve this problem, the county committee decided to temporarily merge the original twenty-four county-level offices into seven, and move all offices and departments to production teams with arduous tasks. This allowed 90% of the cadres to be drawn out and settle down in production teams. Driven and influenced by the county committee, communes and production teams also moved their offices to the fields, creating a new situation where cadres directed from the front and everyone participated in production.

After cadres at all levels went deep into the front lines, they were assigned responsibility for specific areas, covering production and life, taking charge of everything from beginning to end. They all chose relatively backward production teams and small production teams as their key leadership targets, to promptly summarize experiences and guide the overall situation. After the First Secretary of the County Committee went deep into the Xigaohe Production Team of the Beiluo Commune, he found that the team's labor force on the agricultural front was still insufficient. Through investigations and discussions with team cadres and commune members, they adopted measures such as reforming tools, reducing service personnel on the welfare front, and reducing production management personnel, freeing up more than 20 people to strengthen the agricultural production front. After this team's experience was widely promoted throughout the county, more than 20,000 laborers were quickly added to the agricultural front, basically solving the problem of labor shortage. According to statistics, since July, the county has summarized and promoted more than 30 important experiences.

After cadres at all levels went deep into the front lines, they paid attention to the lives of commune members while grasping production. First, they verified the commune members' rations through team-by-team investigation and accounting, and then vigorously helped production teams consolidate and improve their canteens. Cadres at all levels went to eat in poorly-run canteens, identifying and solving problems. Wei Qinghai, Secretary of the County Committee Secretariat, settled in the Nanwangtuan Production Team of the Caozhuang Commune, and found that the team's canteen had problems such as low grain processing efficiency. He immediately discussed it with the team cadres and started a powered grain processing station, thereby improving the canteen. In less than a month, 413 second-class canteens in the county were upgraded to first-class canteens, and 80% of the canteens achieved mechanized grain processing, saving a large number of laborers and investing them in agricultural production.

After the Tang County's county and commune offices moved to production teams, and 90% of the cadres went deep into the front lines to take charge of specific areas, the production movement unfolded vigorously and solidly. According to statistics, the attendance rate of commune members in the county increased by 20% compared to the past, and labor efficiency increased by 30%. By early August, the task of weeding and eliminating wasteland on 590,000 mu of spring and summer crops had been completed, and the second hoeing had begun; more than 200,000 mu of autumn crops had been universally top-dressed once; and an average of more than 0.4 mu of autumn vegetables had been planted per person in the county. The wheat sowing preparation work, centered on soil, fertilizer, and water, has made great progress. All 350,000 mu of wheat fields planned for sowing in the county have been planned into squares, and soil improvement and the construction of drainage and irrigation projects are being carried out in conjunction with autumn field management and flood prevention and drought resistance, and yellow and green manure has been applied according to the requirement of 10 mu per pit and 10,000 jin of fertilizer per pit.

People's Daily, Taiyuan, August 18th. Lu Da, Acting First Secretary of the Jin Southeast Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shanxi Province, went deep into the Jianning Working Area of the Gaoping Commune in Jincheng County and worked with cadres and the masses to summarize field management experiences and jointly discuss plans for winning a bumper harvest, both helping grassroots cadres learn work methods and encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses.

At the beginning of his arrival in the Jianning Working Area, Comrade Lu Da went to the fields to hoe seedlings, working and chatting with commune members at the same time. He found that the crops here were growing well, but some commune members were slackening off in their autumn field management. To further understand the situation, he immediately convened a symposium. At the meeting, it was found that a few cadres and masses had a mentality of being satisfied with the status quo and did not want to strengthen field management, lacking ideological preparation to continue fighting against various natural disasters. They said that as long as God sent a few timely rains, the crops would definitely have a good harvest.

To reverse this slackening mood and ensure a high yield of corn, Comrade Lu Da and the local cadres and commune members summarized their experiences in making a big effort to increase corn production this year. These experiences can be summarized as follows: 1. Carry out deep plowing of the land on a large scale, and generally implement the corn furrow-field rotation system; 2. Vigorously grasp fertilizer, apply more fertilizer, apply fertilizer according to local conditions, and apply fertilizer in stages; 3. Grasp water conservancy and make a big effort to irrigate during the summer drought; 4. Prepare early, sow early, and process early; 5. Select good varieties and implement wide ridges and dense planting; 6. Fight against natural disasters, and so on. Through the summary, the commune members' hearts were brightened, and they said: The good growth of crops is the result of everyone's hard work. If we slack off in management in the future, and encounter disasters, all our previous efforts will be in vain. To win a bumper harvest, we must still work hard.

Therefore, at the symposium, Comrade Lu Da also mobilized commune members to discuss further strengthening field management and winning a bumper harvest of corn. Through discussions on issues such as whether to sit and wait for a bumper year or ensure a bumper year, whether to want a small bumper harvest or a big bumper harvest, the main measures for the next stage of field management were formulated: (1) Vigorously grasp third-class seedlings and carry out special processing. According to the inspection, there are about 10% of third-class seedlings in the entire working area. These autumn fields should be hoeed more than once, and manure and chemical fertilizers should be applied to allow the third-class fields to catch up with the first-class fields. (2) Think the worst and make full preparations for drought resistance. To this end, draw some laborers to sink ten water wells. Vigorously grasp rice paddies and moisture-preserving fields. Dry land should also be irrigated. (3) Prevent insects, prevent wind, and continue to fight against all natural disasters. (4) Universally carry out artificial pollination of corn, and each management area should immediately designate someone to be responsible.

After the symposium, the Jianning Working Area immediately convened a mobilization meeting to march toward high standards of late autumn field management. Seven days later, all 12,000 mu of corn had been hoeed three times and the third top-dressing had been applied; millet and other grain crops had also been hoeed twice and the second top-dressing had been applied. More than 2,400 mu of third-class fields were given "preferential treatment," and each field reached the point of being free of grass and yellow seedlings. In addition, 555 mu of late autumn crops were expanded, and more than 100,000 dan of fertilizer were accumulated.

While helping the masses summarize production experience and formulate new measures for autumn field management, Comrade Lu Da also helped cadres reverse the current thinking in guiding production of emphasizing high-yield fields and neglecting general fields and small plots, and helped cadres implement the leadership methods of "three guarantees," "four togethers," and sticking to the end, so that the cadres' work style was further improved.

After Comrade Lu Da went deep into the Jianning Working Area to dissect the "sparrow," he had a better understanding of guiding the work of the entire region. On the basis of summarizing the first stage of field management work, the Prefectural Committee immediately organized a new upsurge of field management in the entire region. In leading the work of doing a good job in field management, the Prefectural Committee and Party Committees at all levels implemented the principles of classified guidance and focusing on key points. Wuxiang, Jincheng, Licheng and other counties with good autumn field growth focused on large-scale top-dressing and large-scale hoeing to strive for greater harvests. Tuncun County, which was more severely affected by disasters, focused on expanding the planting of late autumn crops and expanding the area for planting vegetables, striving not to reduce production despite the disasters. Party Committee Secretaries at all levels went deep into the front lines of production and deep into backward areas. Yangcheng, Lingchuan, Xiangyuan and other counties transferred a thousand cadres to serve as deputy positions in backward communes and teams, strengthening the leadership of backward areas.

    唐县90％的干部到生产第一线　县、社办公室搬到生产队
    深入田间和群众一起夺取秋季好收成
    晋东南地委书记陆达同志深入一点，解剖“麻雀”，总结经验，推动全区加强田间管理
    新华社天津18日电　中共河北省唐县县委，紧紧抓住当前夺取秋季丰收的关键时期，采取坚决彻底的措施，抽调90％的干部深入生产第一线，把县、社办公室和各机关部门全部搬到生产队，大干四个月，夺取秋季丰收和秋种全胜。
    这个县自贯彻执行“二五制”的工作方法以来，虽然领导作风有了很大改进，大批干部深入到生产第一线，参加生产、领导生产。但和夺取秋季大丰收的任务还不能完全相适应。如有些办公室仍设在上边，这就不能不牵制到一批干部不能深入实际。为了解决这个问题，县委决定把县级原来的二十四个办公室暂时合并成七个，并且把各办公室和机关部门全部搬到任务艰巨的生产队去，这样就可抽调出90％的干部，到生产队扎根落户。在县委的带动和影响下，各公社、生产队也纷纷把办公室搬到田间，出现了干部指挥到前线，人人动手搞生产的新局面。
    各级干部深入第一线以后，分片包干，包生产、包生活，一包到底。他们都选择比较落后的生产队、生产小队，作为自己的领导重点，以便及时总结经验，指导全面。县委第一书记深入到北罗公社西高和生产队以后，发现这个队农业战线的劳力还不足。通过和队干部、社员摸底算账，研究商量，采取了改革工具，压缩生活福利战线的服务人员，减少生产管理人员等办法，腾出了二十多人充实了农业生产战线。这队的经验在全县普遍推广后，使农业战线很快增添了两万多名劳动力，基本上解决了劳力不足的问题。据统计，从7月份以来，全县共总结和推广了三十多项重要经验。
    各级干部深入第一线以后，在抓生产的同时，注意抓社员的生活。首先通过逐队摸底算账，落实了社员的口粮，然后大力帮助生产队巩固和提高食堂。各级干部都到办得较差的食堂去吃饭，发现问题解决问题。县委书记处书记魏清海，在曹庄公社南王疃生产队落户以后，发现这个队的食堂存在着粮食加工效率低等问题。他立刻同队干部商量，搞起了动力粮食加工站，从而搞好了食堂。不到一个月的时间，全县有四百一十三个二类食堂升为第一类食堂，并有80％的食堂实现了粮食加工机械化，节省出大批劳动力，投入农业生产。
    唐县的县、社办公室搬到生产队，90％的干部深入第一线分片包干以后，使生产运动开展得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。据统计，全县社员出勤率比过去提高20％，劳动效率提高了30％。到8月上旬，全县五十九万亩春夏作物的锄草灭荒任务已经完成，开始复锄第二遍；二十多万亩秋田作物，普遍追了一次肥；全县平均每人种上了四分多秋菜。以土、肥、水为中心的小麦播种准备工作，已取得很大成绩。全县计划播种的三十五万亩麦田，已全部规划成方，结合秋田管理和防涝抗涝，进行着土壤改良和修整排灌工程，并已按着十亩一坑，每坑万斤肥的要求，压上了黄肥绿肥。
    本报太原18日电　中共山西省晋东南地委代理第一书记陆达，深入到晋城县高平公社建宁工作区和干部、群众一起，总结田间管理经验，共商争取丰收大计，既帮助基层干部学会了工作方法，又鼓舞了群众的干劲。
    陆达同志到建宁工作区之初，就下地锄苗，一面劳动，一面和社员谈心。他发现这里的庄稼长得好，但有些社员对秋田管理却放松了。为了进一步了解情况，他随即召开了座谈会。会上发现少数干部和群众有满足现状、不想再加强田间管理的想法，缺乏继续同各种自然灾害作斗争的思想准备。他们说，只要老天再下几场适时雨，这庄稼丰收没问题。
    为了扭转这种松劲情绪，确保玉米丰产，陆达同志便和当地干部、社员一起总结了他们今年大闹玉米丰产的经验。这些经验归结起来是：一、大搞土地深翻，普遍实行玉米渠田轮作制；二、大抓肥料，多施肥、因地施肥、分期施肥；三、抓水利，大闹伏浇；四、早准备早下种，早加工；五、选优良品种，实行宽垅密植；六、向自然灾害作斗争，等。通过总结，社员们心里亮堂了，他们说：庄稼长得好，是大家辛苦劳动的结果。如果今后放松了管理，遇点灾害，以前的功夫就白费了，要夺得丰收，还得大干一场。
    于是，在座谈会上，陆达同志又发动社员讨论了进一步加强田间管理、夺取玉米丰收的措施。通过是坐等丰年，还是确保丰年？是要小丰收，还是要大丰收等问题的讨论，订出了下一步后期田间管理的主要措施：（一）大抓三类苗，进行特殊加工。据检查，全工作区共有10％左右的三类苗，对这些秋田要普遍多锄一遍，施粪肥和化肥，让三类田赶上一类田。（二）从坏处着想，充分作抗旱准备。为此，抽一些劳力打水井十眼。并大抓水田、保墒田。对旱地也要灌浇。
  （三）防虫、防风、继续向一切自然灾害作斗争。（四）普遍进行玉米人工授粉，各管理区立即确定专人负责。
    座谈会后，建宁工作区立即召开了向秋田后期管理高标准进军的誓师大会。七天以后，一万二千亩玉米全部锄过三锄，施了第三次追肥；谷子和其他粮食作物也锄过二锄和施了第二次追肥。二千四百多亩三类田，吃了“偏饭”，块块达到了无草无黄苗。此外，还扩种了晚秋作物五百五十五亩，积肥十万多担。
    陆达同志在帮助群众总结生产经验，订出秋田管理新措施的同时，还帮助干部扭转了当前指导生产上重视丰产田，忽视一般田、小块地的思想，帮助干部实行了“三包”、“四同”、一竿子插到底的领导方法，使干部的工作作风有了进一步的改进。
    陆达同志深入建宁工作区解剖“麻雀”之后，对指导全区工作更加心中有了数。地委在总结田间管理第一阶段工作的基础上，立即在全区组织了一个田间管理的新的高潮。在领导做好田间管理的工作中，地委和各级党委都贯彻了分类指导、重点突击的原则。秋田长得好的武乡、晋城、黎城等县，以大追（肥）大锄为中心，争取更大丰收。受灾较重的屯长县，则着重扩种晚秋作物，扩大种菜面积，力争受灾不减产。各级党委书记深入到生产第一线，深入到后进地区。阳城、陵川、襄垣等下放了千名干部到后进社、队担任副职，加强了后进地区的领导。（附图片）
