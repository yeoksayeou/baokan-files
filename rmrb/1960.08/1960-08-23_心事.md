Title: A Worry

A batch of boiler-locomotives supporting rural drought resistance are lined up in the workshop like soldiers ready to set off.

After completing this urgent task ahead of schedule, people finally breathed a sigh of relief and immediately went to work on other things. Only Master Zou still looked anxious, because he found that out of two hundred boiler-locomotives, only one hundred and ninety-nine chicken feather pads were used.

"Clearly two hundred were received, why is there one left over?" Master Zou thought to himself, "It must be that one boiler-locomotive is missing one on the 'horse's belly'. If I can't find it, it will leak when it gets to the countryside." Master Zou thought as he checked. Suddenly, someone notified Master Zou to attend a production meeting, so Master Zou handed over the inspection task to his apprentice, Little Wang. He said to Little Wang, "Check carefully and be sure to find that boiler-locomotive."

When Master Zou returned from the meeting, none of the two hundred boiler-locomotives were there. "Huh?" Master Zou quickly asked, "Little Wang, that boil..."

Little Wang said, "Before I could finish the inspection, the train came and took them all away."

"Why did you let them take them away!" Master Zou was obviously more anxious.

Little Wang said, "They said the countryside needs them urgently, and the sooner the better."

Master Zou quickly went to the business section to ask which communes the batch of boiler-locomotives had been sent to. The people in the business section said, "Which commune? So many! Henan, Guangzhou, and Shanxi, and some in the suburbs."

When Master Zou heard that they had been sent so far away, he really couldn't check them anymore. Because of this matter, Master Zou always felt like there was a disease in his heart. More than a month has passed since then, but Master Zou always remembers it and keeps it in his mind.

Yesterday, Master Zou went to the fields of a suburban people's commune to weed with the factory's support-agriculture team. At noon, when everyone was resting, the commune brought boiled water and tea. Master Zou walked over to a boiler-locomotive. When he got closer, it was so coincidental! Without looking at anything else, just looking at the fish-scale-like welding seams, he knew that this boiler-locomotive was made by his workshop. Master Zou was happy and worried to see the boiler-locomotive he made being used in rural production. The engine rumbled, and Master Zou's heart pounded along with it. The driver nodded to Master Zou, and Master Zou smiled and asked the driver, "Is the boiler-locomotive working well?"

The driver said, "It's good, but it often leaks on the 'horse's belly'."

Master Zou's face flushed, and he said, "Do you have a wrench? There might be a missing chicken feather pad inside."

"Well, we don't have one." The driver said to Master Zou, "Uncle, it doesn't matter, we can make do with it."

When Master Zou heard the word "make do," he felt as if he had been pricked by a needle.

In the evening, the support-agriculture team returned to the factory by truck. Master Zou got off the truck and went straight to the workshop without even eating dinner. He took out a chicken feather pad, brought his tools, and rode his bicycle straight to the suburban people's commune.

At dinner time, people couldn't find Master Zou anywhere. His apprentice, Little Wang, was the most worried. Little Wang stood at the factory gate and waited until late at night before Master Zou returned on his bicycle. Seeing Little Wang, he was so happy that he wanted to jump up and say, "Little Wang, my illness is gone!"

"Illness?" Little Wang was a little confused.

"Have you forgotten?" Master Zou stared at Little Wang's eyes and said, "The boiler-locomotive that was missing a chicken feather pad has been found!"

    心事

    一批支援农村抗旱的锅驼机，正像整装待发的战士排立在车间里。
    提前完成了这批紧急任务后，人们才缓了口气，紧接着又去忙别的活儿了。惟有邹师傅却还显得面色焦急，因为他发现二百台锅驼机，只用上了一百九十九个鸡毛垫。
    “明明是领了二百个，为什么会剩下一个呢？”邹师傅心里想：“不定是在哪个锅驼机的驮马肚上少放了一个。如果检查不出来，到了农村要漏水的。”邹师傅一边想一边检查。忽然有人通知邹师傅去开生产会议，邹师傅就把这个检查任务交给他的徒弟小王了；他对小王说：“要细心检查，一定把那台锅驼机找出来。”
    等邹师傅开完会回来，二百台锅驼机，一台也不在了。嗬，邹师傅连忙问：“小王，那锅……。”
    小王说：“还没等检查完呢，火车来了，全装走了。”
    “为什么叫人家拉走呢！”显然邹师傅更着急了。
    小王说：“人家说农村急着用，早一会是一会的事儿。”
    邹师傅赶紧又去问业务科：这批锅驼机都发到哪个公社去了。业务科的人说，哪个公社？可多啦！河南的、广州的，还有山西的，郊区也有点。
    邹师傅一听说发出去这么远，也真没法再检查了。为这件事儿，邹师傅总像有个病存在心上似的。事情到今天已经隔一个多月了，但邹师傅却老是念念不忘，挂在心上。
    昨天邹师傅随厂里支援农村大队，到郊区人民公社田间拔草，晌午时候，大家休息时，公社送来了开水和茶水。邹师傅走到一台锅驼机旁边去。他走近一看，真巧极了！甭看别的，光看那鱼鳞似的电焊缝，就知道这台锅驼机是自己车间出的活儿。邹师傅看到自己做的锅驼机在农村生产了，心里又高兴，又耽心。发动机嘟嘟地响，邹师傅的心也随着扑通扑通地跳。司机向邹师傅点点头，邹师傅笑着问司机：“锅驼机好使不？”
    司机说：“好倒是好，就是骑马肚上经常漏水。”
    邹师傅的脸刷地红了，说：“你们有搬子吗？这里边可能缺鸡毛垫。”
    “这，我们没有。”司机向邹师傅说，“大叔，不要紧的，能凑合着用。”
    邹师傅听到“凑合”两个字，像针扎似地难过。
    傍晚的时候，支援农村的大队，乘卡车回到工厂，邹师傅下了车，连饭没吃，便跑到车间。他取出鸡毛垫，带上工具，骑上自行车又直奔郊区人民公社。
    吃晚饭的时候，人们到处找不到邹师傅，他的徒弟小王最着急。小王站在厂门口，直等到深夜，邹师傅才骑自行车回来了，见了小王高兴得要跳起来，说：“小王，我的病去掉啦！”
    “病？”小王有点莫名其妙。
    “你忘啦，”邹师傅瞅着小王的眼睛说，“缺鸡毛垫的那台锅驼机找到了！”
