    Suzhou Prefecture Launches Propaganda Campaign
    To Popularize the Idea of Agriculture as the Foundation
    Promoting Support for Agriculture and Driving Current Production
    (Our report) The Suzhou Prefecture of Jiangsu Province has launched a vigorous propaganda campaign of “Agriculture as the Foundation.”
    Various methods were used in various places to carry out propaganda. Many places held meetings, group meetings, field meetings, cool-off meetings, and heart-to-heart talks, organizing mass discussions to make the idea of "taking agriculture as the foundation" known to every household. The cadres of the organs, workers, teachers, students, and residents who went to the countryside to support agriculture were not only combatants but also propagandists. In Kunshan County, each commune organized twenty-two propaganda teams to carry out propaganda in various art forms to production teams. More than 4,000 small team clubs in Changshu County played a significant role in the propaganda of agriculture as the foundation. Some small team clubs organized exhibitions of good deeds titled "Who Contributes the Most to the Development of Agriculture" in the canteens, and some organized newspaper reading activities during rest after meals. More than 160 commune amateur party schools and more than 800 branch schools in the entire prefecture, as well as mass theory schools in communes such as Qiandun and Ligang, also carried out theoretical studies of "agriculture as the foundation." The Wu County Party Committee recently held an on-site meeting for the whole party and the whole people to study theory in Guangfu Commune.
    In this propaganda campaign, some counties closely combined the summary of summer production and carried out large-scale competitions, commendations, and competitions to promote autumn with summer. Wujiang County, through summarizing summer production, analyzed the situation of autumn production to the masses, making everyone see that autumn grain production accounts for more than 85% of the total annual agricultural income. At present, it is necessary to firmly grasp autumn grain production, thus proposing the mobilization of the whole people to attack the four passes (rice tillering pass, thickening pass, booting pass, grain filling pass), eliminate the six pests (drought, flood, disease, insects, wind, grass), thousands of ingenious plans to engage in innovation, a hundred burdens of fine fertilizer to seize a thousand catties, ten thousand mu of high-yield (areas) to lead the large fields, and every item leaps forward with a complete victory, setting off a vigorous movement of exceeding a thousand catties of rice in the county. All medium-sized and small towns, and all fronts also held meetings respectively to implement the education of "agriculture as the foundation," summarized and evaluated the work of supporting agriculture in the first half of the year, accepted experiences and lessons, and organized a new upsurge of supporting agriculture.
    This propaganda of "agriculture as the foundation," because of its close connection with reality and thinking, has greatly promoted the movement of supporting agriculture and promoted current production. After mobilization and preliminary study, more than 2,000 cadres at the prefecture and county levels have gone deep into the front line under the leadership of the prefectural party committee and the county party committee secretaries. All communes have extensively tapped labor potential. At present, about 80% of the labor force has been invested in agricultural production, and large and small towns throughout the prefecture have extensively and deeply carried out activities to support agriculture.

    苏州专区开展宣传运动
    让农业为基础的思想家喻户晓
    促进了对农业的支援　推动了当前生产
    本报讯　江苏省苏州专区开展了一个轰轰烈烈的“农业为基础”的宣传运动。
    各地运用了多种多样的方法，展开了宣传。许多地方召开了大会、小组会、田头会、乘凉会、谈心会，组织全民大讨论，使“以农业为基础”的思想家喻户晓。下乡支援农业的机关干部、工人、教师、学生、居民，既是战斗员，又做宣传员。昆山县各公社还组织了二十二个宣传鼓动队，到生产小队去运用各种文艺形式开展宣传。常熟县四千多个小队俱乐部对以农业为基础的宣传发挥了很大作用。有的小队俱乐部在食堂里办起了“谁为发展农业出力最多”的好人好事展览会，有的利用饭后休息时间，组织读报活动。全专区一百六十多所公社业余党校和八百多所分校，以及茜墩、利港等公社的群众理论学校，也都开展了“以农业为基础”的理论学习。吴县县委最近在光福公社召开全党全民学理论现场会议。
    这次宣传运动中有些县紧密结合总结夏季生产，开展大评比、大表扬、大竞赛，以夏促秋。吴江县通过总结夏季生产，向群众分析秋季生产的形势，使大家看到秋熟生产占全年农业总收入85％以上，当前必须狠抓秋熟生产，从而提出全民动员攻四关（水稻分蘖关、长粗关、孕穗关、籽粒饱满关），灭六害（旱、涝、病、虫、风、草），千条巧计闹革新，百担精肥夺千斤，万亩丰产（片）带大田，项项跃进满堂红，在全县范围内掀起了轰轰烈烈的水稻超千斤运动。各中、小市镇，各条战线也都分别召开了会议，贯彻了“以农业为基础”的教育，总结评比上半年支援农业的工作，接受经验教训，组织新的支援农业高潮。
    这次“以农业为基础”的宣传，由于紧密联系实际，联系思想，已经大大促进了支援农业运动，推动了当前生产。地、县级机关干部经过动员和初步学习，已有两千多人在地委和县委书记带领下深入第一线。各公社都大挖劳动潜力，目前投入农业生产的劳力已达80％左右，全专区的大小市镇广泛深入地开展了支援农业的活动。
