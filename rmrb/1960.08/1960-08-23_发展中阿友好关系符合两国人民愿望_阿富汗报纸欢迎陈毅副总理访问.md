Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, August 21st: Afghan newspapers yesterday and today warmly welcomed the friendly visit of Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Marshal Chen Yi to Afghanistan. The newspapers all carried a brief biography and photographs of Vice Premier Chen Yi on their front pages.

	"Friendship News" and "Reform News" both published editorials expressing a strong hope that the Afghan government and people would strengthen friendly relations with China. They also published two photos on the front page showing Afghan Deputy Prime Minister Naim with Vice Premier Chen Yi during his visit to China last year.

	"Reform News" stated in its editorial today that it firmly believes that Vice Premier Chen Yi's visit will help strengthen relations between Afghanistan and China. The Afghan people will give him a warm welcome and cordial reception. The editorial said, "Our relations with China are friendly, and through various contacts, this relationship has been continuously developing. Just now, a large Chinese art troupe has arrived in Kabul to join us in our Independence Day celebrations. Only two weeks ago, an Afghan artist delegation went to China for a friendly visit and received a warm reception there."

	The editorial said, "Afghanistan maintains friendly and sincere relations with all countries. It has consistently pursued this policy in recent years. Although Afghanistan and China have different political, economic, and social systems, the relations between the two countries have been strengthened satisfactorily. Mutual visits by outstanding leaders of Afghanistan and China have played a decisive role in the relations between the two countries. Exchanges of cultural and artistic delegations have promoted the relations between the two countries. Now, Marshal Chen Yi has come to our country, especially during our celebration of our glorious festival. Marshal Chen Yi, in addition to holding an important position in the Chinese government, is also a great figure in his own country. This is another important step in developing friendship between Afghanistan and China."

	"Friendship News" said in its editorial yesterday that the Afghan people are pleased to welcome a great figure from a country that has maintained friendly and perfect relations with Afghanistan for hundreds of years.

	The editorial also said that since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese people, under the leadership of their leaders—including His Excellency Marshal Chen Yi—have carried out a series of unprecedented reforms in agriculture, industry, commerce, and education, and have achieved good results. The editorial emphasized that the relations between Afghanistan and China have always been very good. It said that Afghanistan was one of the first countries to recognize the People's Republic of China and established good relations with it. Due to the sincere wishes of the two countries, this relationship has further developed in the past few years. Mutual visits by great leaders of the two countries, such as the visits of Afghan Prime Minister Daoud and Foreign Minister Naim to China and the visit of Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai to Afghanistan, as well as the mutual visits of cultural, medical, and trade delegations of the two countries, have played a significant role in developing friendly relations between the two countries.

	The editorial concluded, "We are confident that this visit by Marshal Chen Yi, as a good manifestation of the friendly relations between the two countries, will play a major role in further strengthening the bonds of perfect friendship between the two countries. Together with our people, we wish His Excellency Marshal Chen Yi a pleasant stay in Afghanistan and that he will bring back the pleasant feelings he has gained in Afghanistan to the friendly People's Republic of China."

    阿富汗报纸欢迎陈毅副总理访问
    新华社喀布尔21日电　阿富汗各大报在昨天和今天热烈欢迎中国副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅对阿富汗的友好访问。这些报纸都在头版上刊载了陈毅副总理的略传和照片。
    “友谊报”和“革新报”都发表社论，表示强烈希望阿富汗政府和人民加强同中国的友好关系。它们还在头版上刊载了阿富汗副首相纳伊姆在去年访问中国时同陈毅副总理一起拍摄的两张照片。
      “革新报”在今天的社论中表示坚信，陈毅副总理的访问，将有助于加强阿富汗同中国之间的关系。阿富汗人民将给他热烈的欢迎和亲切的接待。社论说，“我们同中国的关系是友好的，通过各方面的接触，这种关系已经得到不断的发展。就在现在，一个大的中国艺术团已经到达喀布尔来同我们一起参加我们的独立节庆典。仅在两个星期以前，一个阿富汗艺术家代表团到中国去进行友好访问，在那里受到了热烈的接待。”
    社论说，“阿富汗同所有的国家保持友好和诚挚的关系。它近年来一贯地奉行这项政策。尽管阿富汗和中国的政治、经济和社会制度不同，但是两国的关系已经得到令人满意的加强。阿富汗和中国的杰出领导人的互相访问，在两国的关系中起了决定性的作用。文化和艺术代表团的往来促进了两国的关系。现在陈毅元帅特别在我们庆祝我们的光荣的节日的时候来到了我国，陈毅元帅除了在中国政府内有着重要地位外，也是他自己国内的一位伟大人物，这是发展阿富汗和中国之间友谊的重要的另一步骤。”
    “友谊报”在昨天的社论中说，阿富汗人民高兴地欢迎一位来自一个几百年来同阿富汗保持友好和完善关系的国家的伟大人物。
    社论又说，自从中华人民共和国在1949年建立之后，中国人民在自己的领导人——包括陈毅元帅阁下——的领导下，在农业、工业、商业和教育等方面进行了一系列的史无前例的改革，并取得了良好的结果。社论强调说，阿富汗和中国之间的关系始终是十分良好的。它说，阿富汗是最先承认中华人民共和国的国家之一，并且同它建立了良好的关系。由于两国的诚挚愿望，这种关系在过去几年中又有了进一步的发展。两国的伟大领导人的互相访问，例如阿富汗首相达乌德和外交大臣纳伊姆对中国的访问和中国总理周恩来对阿富汗的访问，以及两国文化、医学和贸易代表团的互相访问，在发展两国之间的友好关系方面都起了显著的作用。
    社论最后说，“我们确信，作为两国友好关系的良好表现的陈毅元帅的这次访问，将在进一步加强两国之间的完美的友谊的连系方面起重大的作用。我们同我国人民一道，祝陈毅元帅阁下在阿富汗的逗留将是愉快的，并将把他在阿富汗得到的愉快感情带回到友好的中华人民共和国去。”
