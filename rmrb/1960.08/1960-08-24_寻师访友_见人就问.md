Seeking Teachers and Friends, Asking Everyone We Meet
    Liu Feng

    In Xiejia Village, Luoluo Commune, at the foot of Baiyun Mountain in Xingtai County, Hebei, there wasn't a single literate person originally. However, they were full of the spirit of stubbornly fighting against the economic poverty and cultural backwardness left over from the old society. Without teachers, they sent people to travel over mountains and ridges to learn from experience and then teach everyone. They also mobilized the masses to seek out teachers and friends to learn to read. One child even brought back three characters after visiting relatives at his maternal grandmother's house. They didn't let go of any opportunity to learn to read that they happened to encounter, "learning every character they saw and asking every person they met." When a comrade went to Beijing as a temporary worker, everyone asked him to learn to use an abacus. This comrade didn't disappoint the villagers' expectations and mastered addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on the abacus in Beijing, which he then taught to the entire village upon his return.

    Such a method of learning culture, self-reliantly starting from a situation with absolutely no conditions, is truly rare at home and abroad. This demonstrates the great determination and perseverance of the people of Xiejia Village, under the leadership of the Party, to change their past state of "poverty and blankness" and build a socialist home; this determination and perseverance have become a tremendous driving force for their learning. With this driving force, they have been able to change their state of "blankness," to the point that they have not only become a village without illiteracy but have also popularized spare-time junior middle school education.

    Lenin said: "A communist society cannot be built in a country plagued by illiteracy." Our people also deeply understand: "Communism is heaven, and you can't get there without culture!" The large number of illiterate people in our country is a serious problem, but we are now solving the problem of "blankness" while also addressing the problem of "poverty." Since the establishment of rural people's communes, people have been more eager to learn culture due to economic and labor needs. After the establishment of the "large in size and public in nature" rural people's communes, the people had the strength of the collective, and the situation completely changed. They could organize themselves to learn culture. Under the leadership of the communes, people-run schools have sprung up everywhere, and there are more and more people who can read, write, and calculate.

    The people of Xiejia Village have truly inherited the fine tradition of hard work and struggle of the Chinese working people and have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of striving to become stronger. This should become an inspiring force for many places that are in better condition than Xiejia Village, similar to Xiejia Village, or even worse than Xiejia Village. This spirit of seeking teachers and friends, learning every character they see, and asking every person they meet, will forever shine brightly in our great march towards communism and the peak of modern science and culture.

    寻师访友  见人就问
    刘丰
    河北邢台县白云山下路罗公社谢家沟，原来村里没有一个识字的人，可是他们充满了同旧社会遗留下来的经济贫困、文化落后状况进行顽强斗争的精神，没有老师，他们就派人翻山越岭去取经，回来教大家，又发动群众寻师访友来识字。一个孩子到外祖母家去串亲戚，也捎回三个字。他们对偶然遇到的一些可以识字的机会也不放过。“见字就学，见人就问”。一位同志到北京当临时工，大家就要他学会打算盘，这位同志没有辜负乡亲们的嘱托，在北京学会了珠算的加减乘除，回来教给了全村。
    像这样学文化的办法，从没有任何条件的情况下自力更生，真是中外少闻罕见的。这说明了谢家沟的人民在党的领导下，对于改变自己过去“一穷二白”状况、建设社会主义家园，具有多么大的决心和毅力；这种决心和毅力就成为他们学习的一种巨大的动力。有了这种动力，他们就能够改变他们“白”的状况，以致不仅仅成了无盲村，并且普及了业余初中教育。
    列宁说过：“在一个文盲充斥的国家内，是建成不了共产主义社会的。”我国的人民也深深懂得：“共产主义是天堂，没有文化不能上！”我国文盲众多，这是一个严重的问题，可是，现在在改变“穷”的过程中，我们也同时在解决“白”的状况。自从农村人民公社成立后，因为经济上的需要，劳动上的需要，人们更迫切地要求学习文化。“一大二公”的农村人民公社建立后，人民有了集体的力量，情况就完全改变了，他们可以自己组织学文化。在公社的领导下，各地纷纷成立了民校，识字能写会算的人是越来越多了。
    谢家沟的人民，真正继承了我国劳动人民艰苦奋斗的优良传统，发扬了发愤图强的革命精神。这对许多条件比谢家沟好、同谢家沟差不多、甚或比谢家沟还要差的地方来说，都应该成为鼓舞的力量。这种寻师访友，见字就学，见人就问的学习精神，将在我们走向共产主义、攀登现代科学文化高峰的伟大进军中，永远放着光芒。
