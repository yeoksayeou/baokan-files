Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 7th: A conference held here today commemorating the 15th anniversary of the US atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, passed a resolution stating that the Ceylon Peace Committee and all peace-loving people in Ceylon fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's initiative on countries in the Asian and Pacific region concluding a peace pact and making the region a nuclear-weapon-free zone, thereby guaranteeing lasting peace in the East and the world.

This conference was convened by the Ceylon Peace Committee.

The resolution also condemned Belgian imperialists for invading the Congo and violating the independence of the Republic of the Congo with the support of other imperialist countries.

The resolution also condemned the provocative flights of US spy planes in Soviet airspace.

The resolution extended congratulations to the newly liberated people of Asia and Africa who are defending themselves. The resolution demanded the withdrawal of all foreign troops and military delegations in other countries.

People from all walks of life spoke at the conference.

Venerable Saranankara, a member of the World Peace Council and a recipient of the Lenin Peace Prize, called for a ban on all weapons of mass destruction. He also exposed the United States' two-faced policy of talking about peace while preparing for war.

Ceylon's Minister of Health, Jayasuriya, who chaired the conference, also pointed out in his speech that the new government will continue to pursue the policy advocated by the late Prime Minister Bandaranaike of maintaining friendly relations with all countries to promote world peace.
