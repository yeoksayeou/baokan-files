(Reported by our newspaper) Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps' six newly established Mosuowan military reclamation farms have simultaneously reclaimed land and sown seeds, resulting in a large-scale, high-yield bumper harvest of wheat this year, becoming a red banner for multiple harvests and high yields in the Xinjiang region.

Mosuowan is located in the hinterland of the Junggar Basin and was once an uninhabited wilderness. Over the past two years, the People's Liberation Army soldiers have reclaimed more than 840,000 mu of wasteland here, with a planting area reaching 750,000 mu. Among them, the recently harvested 264,000 mu of winter wheat have all achieved large-scale, high-yield bumper harvests. These farms can hand over 50 million jin of wheat to the state in addition to achieving self-sufficiency in one season. On average, each worker managing wheat fields produced more than 50,000 jin of wheat for the state, an increase of approximately one-fold compared to last year.

In the past, the various old farms of the Production and Construction Corps used two teams and two sets of machinery for land reclamation and sowing. The capital construction team was solely responsible for capital construction such as water conservancy construction and land reclamation, while the agricultural production unit was solely responsible for agricultural activities such as plowing, sowing, cultivating, managing, and harvesting. Due to the two sets of management systems, the capital construction team could not receive support from the agricultural production unit during the slack season for large-scale land reclamation, while during the busy season, the capital construction team rarely supported the agricultural unit. The Mosuowan farms changed these practices and implemented a method of combining capital construction such as water conservancy construction and land reclamation with agricultural production from the beginning, achieving concentrated efforts on land reclamation during the agricultural slack season and concentrated efforts on agricultural activities during the busy season, implementing a "three-guarantee" system of guaranteeing reclamation, guaranteeing sowing, and guaranteeing costs. This year, the total planting area in Mosuowan was doubled compared to last year, while the labor force and machinery did not increase. This is because the farms seized the three-month agricultural slack period before spring plowing and sowing, using half of the labor force and one-third of the tractors to reclaim large areas of wasteland in the distance, ensuring that land reclamation preceded sowing and sowing followed land reclamation. Therefore, they were able to reclaim land and sow seeds simultaneously.

Mosuowan is an arid wasteland; only with water can crops be planted, and only with sufficient water can high yields be achieved. The Mosuowan farms ensured that water conservancy was given priority from the beginning of land reclamation. In the early stage of land reclamation, the farms concentrated more than 4,700 laborers to cooperatively construct water conservancy projects, implementing large-scale operations, and within 50 days, they constructed four large canals, 122 *hua li* long, capable of irrigating one million mu of land. Subsequently, all farmland construction was based on unified planning, combining land reclamation and sowing with water conservancy, turning fields into gardens, afforestation, and mechanization. The farms constructed more than 2,000 kilometers of canals at all levels, including main, branch, and farm canals, forming a complete gravity irrigation network; they built a 430-kilometer-long network of roads in all directions, facilitating the movement of large tractors and trucks. At the same time, they leveled hundreds of thousands of mu of land and planted more than 54,000 mu of shelterbelts. More than 100,000 mu of farmland with severe salinity and alkalinity have been improved through measures such as leaching salts and applying fertilizers.

In order to achieve large-scale, high-yield bumper harvests of wheat in the wasteland, the Mosuowan farms conscientiously summarized last year's successful experiences, criticized the erroneous view that multiple crops inevitably lead to extensive farming, established the lofty ambition of "man can conquer nature," and formulated a set of technical measures suitable for the local soil, climate, and other natural conditions based on the characteristics of the newly reclaimed land. During the winter wheat sowing period, the farms, based on the experience that early sowing yields more than late sowing, universally adopted timely early sowing within the short sowing period of only a little more than ten days, striving to reduce or eliminate late sowing areas. In the field management work, the farms, based on the characteristics that some wasteland is very fertile, while some wasteland is barren and saline-alkali, focused on preventing lodging in thick soil; and increased water and fertilizer for lean soil to achieve balanced development. This year, in the measures to prevent lodging, the farms appropriately delayed irrigation at the jointing stage for wheat in fertile land, controlling the excessive elongation of the first one to two nodes of the stem base, which can consolidate the number of effective tillers, increase the number of grains per ear, and make the stems strong.

### 新疆莫索湾军垦农场边开荒边播种  新垦荒地小麦大面积丰收  每个管理麦田的职工平均为国家生产小麦五万多斤

    新疆莫索湾军垦农场边开荒边播种
    新垦荒地小麦大面积丰收
    每个管理麦田的职工平均为国家生产小麦五万多斤
    本报讯　新疆生产建设兵团莫索湾六个新建军垦农场边开荒、边播种，使今年小麦获得了大面积高额丰产，成为新疆地区多种多收和高产多收的一面红旗。
    莫索湾位于准噶尔盆地腹部，过去是一片渺无人烟的荒原。两年来人民战士在这里开垦了八十四万多亩荒地，播种面积达到了七十五万亩，其中，最近收获的二十六万四千多亩冬小麦，全部获得了大面积高额丰产。这些农场除实现一季自给外，可上缴给国家五千万斤小麦。平均每个管理麦田的职工为国家生产了五万多斤小麦，比去年增加了大约一倍。
    过去，生产建设兵团各个老场在开荒与播种中都是两班人马，两套机具。基本建设队伍专管兴修水利和开荒造田等基本建设，农业生产单位专管耕、播、耘、管、收等农事活动。由于两套管理制度，农闲大开荒地的时候，基本建设得不到农业生产单位支援，而在农忙时，基本建设队伍也很少支援农业单位。莫索湾各农场改变了这些作法，一开始就实行兴修水利、开荒造田等基本建设与农业生产相结合的办法，做到了农闲突击开荒，农忙突击农事活动，实行包开、包种、包成本的“三包”制度。今年全莫索湾播种面积比去年扩大一倍，而劳力机具没有增加，这是由于各农场抓紧春耕播种前的三个月农闲时期，以半数劳力和三分之一拖拉机开垦远处大面积荒地，使开荒走在播种前面，播种又跟着开荒。因此能做到一边开荒，一边播种。
    莫索湾是一片干旱的荒原，有水才能种地，水足才能高产。莫索湾各农场在开荒中一开始就保证水利先行。在开荒初期，各农场集中了四千七百多个劳动力，协作兴修水利，实行大兵团作战，五十多天就兴修了四条可灌溉百万亩地的长达一百二十二华里的大干渠。以后全部农田建设都是根据统一规划，开荒播种与水利化、园田化、园林化和机械化相结合。各农场共建成干、支、斗、农等各级水道二千多公里，组成完整的自流灌溉网；兴修了长达四百三十多公里的四通八达的公路网，便利大型拖拉机、汽车行驶。同时进行了几十万亩土地的平整工作，种植了五万四千多亩地的防护林带。对十多万亩盐碱严重的农田，都经过冲洗盐碱、施肥等措施改良土壤。
    为了夺取荒地小麦大面积高额丰产，莫索湾各农场认真总结了去年丰收经验，批判了多种免不了粗放的错误论调，树立了人定胜天的雄心壮志，根据新荒地的特点制定出一套适合当地土壤、气候等自然条件的技术措施。冬麦播种期间，各农场根据早播比晚播增产的经验，在适播期只有短短十多天内，普遍采取适时早播，尽力减少或消灭晚播面积。在田间管理工作上，各农场根据部分荒地十分肥沃，部分荒地贫瘠并有盐碱的特点，对厚地着重抓防倒伏；对瘦地水肥加码，使其平衡发展。今年各农场在防倒伏的措施中，对肥地小麦适当推迟灌拔节水，控制茎基部一至二节不过份伸长，这样既可巩固有效分蘖数，增加每穗粒数，又可使茎秆粗壮。（附图片）
