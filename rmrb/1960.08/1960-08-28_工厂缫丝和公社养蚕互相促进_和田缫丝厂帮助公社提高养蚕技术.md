    Factory Silk Reeling and Commune Silkworm Rearing Promote Each Other
    Hotan Silk Reeling Factory Helps Communes Improve Silkworm Rearing Technology
    (Our Newspaper) Hotan Silk Reeling Factory, since last year, has successively dispatched large numbers of employees to various people's communes in the Hotan region to help local Uyghur silkworm farmers improve their silkworm rearing technology.
    Over the past year, the sericulture industry in this region has undergone tremendous changes. In 1959, there was an unprecedented bumper harvest. This year, the situation of autumn silkworms mounting the frames is also very good.
    After the people's communes were established, they brought more favorable conditions for the rapid development of sericulture production. However, due to the failure to thoroughly change some old and unreasonable management methods, the output and quality of cocoons were low, which affected the income of silkworm farmers and directly affected the development of the local silk reeling industry. After careful study, the Party Committee of the Silk Reeling Factory clarified the dialectical relationship between commune silkworm rearing and factory silk reeling, that they promote each other. Starting in the summer of last year, it designated two deputy directors to take charge of this work, and dispatched six workshop director-level cadres, leading more than 600 employees, to be assigned to various people's communes throughout the region. They cooperated with local technical cadres to establish silkworm rearing pilot projects in communes. According to advanced silkworm rearing technology, combined with local silkworm rearing experience, from silkworm room disinfection to feeding management and cocoon mounting, everything was managed according to scientific methods, setting an example of silkworm rearing for the local area. At the same time, they organized silkworm farmers from various production teams to visit and promote advanced silkworm rearing methods. The silkworm rearing pilot project work team also assisted various communes in holding six- or seven-day silkworm rearing training classes, providing all silkworm rearers in the communes with a relatively systematic introduction to new silkworm rearing techniques. Through listening, observing, and doing, the commune members thoroughly changed the backward silkworm rearing methods. Silkworm rooms were no longer smoky and airtight, silkworm leaves were no longer cut into strips and piled high, and silkworm droppings were no longer left unremoved for long periods of time. The labor organization was also rationally adjusted, with special personnel in charge of mulberry picking, mulberry cutting, mulberry wiping, mulberry feeding, and droppings removal. At night, there were also special personnel to take care of the silkworms, and large and small silkworms were raised separately according to their age. This year, the silk reeling factory dispatched more than 300 people to the countryside to work closely with local sericulture technicians to help various communes in summarizing past work experiences. They further strengthened management in the main aspects of both political and material preparation; both business management and technical guidance, so that each commune could strengthen management in the several main links of preparation work, prevention of silkworm diseases, feeding management, and hatching and ant collection. The silkworm rearing situation has improved significantly, with the silkworm rearing period generally shortened from 60 days to less than 30 days, and the number of silkworm rearing cycles increased from once a year to three times. The output and quality of cocoons have greatly improved. Due to the planned and organized assistance of the silk reeling factory to various communes in vigorously developing the sericulture industry, Hotan region has had consecutive bumper harvests of cocoon production for two years. This year, the actual cocoon harvest and planned output will be somewhat higher than last year.

    工厂缫丝和公社养蚕互相促进
    和田缫丝厂帮助公社提高养蚕技术
    本报讯　和田缫丝厂从去年开始，陆续派出大批职工，分赴和田专区各人民公社，帮助当地维吾尔族蚕农提高养蚕技术。
    一年多来，这个专区养蚕事业已发生了巨大的变化，1959年出现了历史上空前未有的大丰收，今年，秋蚕上簇蚕的情况又很好。
    人民公社化以后，给迅速发展蚕桑生产带来了更加有利的条件，但是，由于对一些旧的不合理的管理方法没有彻底改变，蚕茧产量低、质量差，影响蚕农收入，也直接影响当地缫丝工业的发展。缫丝厂党委经过认真研究，明确了公社养蚕和工厂缫丝互相促进的辩证关系。从去年夏天开始，就指定两名副厂长专管这项工作，并派出六名车间主任一级干部，率领六百多职工，分赴全区各人民公社挂钩包干。并与当地技术干部配合，以公社为单位，设立养蚕试点，按照先进的养蚕技术，结合当地养蚕经验，从蚕室消毒，一直到饲养管理、蚕茧上簇，都按照科学办法管理，给当地树立了养蚕榜样。同时，组织了各生产队蚕农参观，推广先进养蚕方法。养蚕试点工作组还协助各公社举办为期六七天的养蚕训练班，给公社所有养蚕人员较系统地传授了一次新法养蚕技术。社员通过边听、边观摩、边做，使落后的养蚕方法得到彻底改变，蚕室不再烟熏密闭，蚕叶不再条切高堆，蚕沙也不再长时间不除。劳动组织也得到了合理调整，采桑、切桑、擦桑、喂桑、除沙，都有专人专管，晚上，也有专人照料，对大蚕、小蚕都能按岭数大小分开饲养。今年，缫丝厂又先后派出三百多人下乡，与当地养蚕技术人员密切配合，帮助各公社在总结过去工作经验的基础上，又进一步地既抓政治，又抓物质准备；既抓经营管理，又抓技术指导，使各公社都能在准备工作、防止蚕病、饲养管理和催青收蚁等几个主要环节上加强了管理，养蚕情况更有显著好转，岭期一般由六十天缩短到三十天以下，养蚕次数由每年一次增到三次，蚕茧产量质量都有很大提高。由于缫丝厂有计划、有组织地帮助各公社大力发展蚕桑事业，和田专区蚕茧生产连续两年大丰收。今年，实收蚕茧和计划产量又将比去年有所增加。
