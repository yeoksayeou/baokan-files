Xinhua News Agency dispatch: French and British public opinion expresses unease about the West German "Bundeswehr" General Staff's demand to equip the West German army with atomic weapons, and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Norstad's request to relax restrictions on West Germany's construction of naval vessels.

    The French newspaper "Liberation" wrote that this is a coordinated plan put forward by the United States and West Germany with the tacit approval of the de Gaulle and Macmillan governments. The newspaper pointed out that the revival of a powerful German (West German) army trained in the spirit of Hitlerism constitutes one of the most serious threats of war. The newspaper reminded readers that "experience proves that one cannot guarantee that the threat from (West) Germany will not be directed at France."

    The French bourgeois newspaper "Le Monde," commenting on the demands of West German militarists, emphasized that France is increasingly being squeezed out by West Germany, and France is inevitably giving way more and more to (West) Germany. The newspaper recently published an article expressing its unease about the demands of West German militarist elements, believing that this is "a violation of the agreement signed by West Germany and its NATO allies in 1955."

    The British "Times" said in a recent editorial that the request for atomic armament by West German military leaders is a serious issue. The editorial said that the issue of providing the NATO forces with Polaris missiles has already caused controversy, but the West German General Staff's booklet intends to demand that the Federal "Bundeswehr" be equipped with such missiles. The editorial said that what is most disturbing is that only four years after the legal approval for the establishment of the West German Federal Defense Force, West German generals have already begun to participate in political leadership. The newspaper called on the West German Federal Government to abandon the Federal Defense Force's booklet and dispel the unpleasant memories it aroused.

    A commentator for the British "Daily Mirror" pointed out that it is not surprising that West German revanchists have made this request. As has often happened in Germany's military history, West German generals are making demands for political power. He reminded readers of this danger, saying, "This is not surprising; would a wolf not eat people?"

    西德原子武装威胁法英安全
    法英报纸纷纷表示不安
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：法国和英国公众对西德“国防军”参谋部要求以原子武器装备西德军队，以及北大西洋军事集团武装部队总司令诺斯塔德要求放宽对西德建造海军舰只的限制，表示不安。
    法国“解放报”写道，这是一个在戴高乐和麦克米伦政府的默许下，由美国和西德提出的协调一致的计划。这家报纸指出，由于要以希特勒主义的精神训练出来的强大德国（西德）军队的复活，已经构成最严重的战争威胁之一。这家报纸提醒说，“经验证明，人们不能够担保，（西）德国的威胁不会指向法国。”
    法国资产阶级报纸“世界报”在评论西德军国主义者的要求时着重指出，法国正在越来越受西德的排挤，法国不可避免地越来越让位给（西）德国。这家报纸在最近发表一篇文章中，对西德军国主义分子的要求很感不安，认为这是“违反西德和它的北大西洋公约组织的盟国在1955年签订的协定”的。
    英国“泰晤士报”在最近的一篇社论中说，西德军队领导人员提出原子军备的要求，是一个严重的问题。社论说，关于提供北大西洋集团部队以北极星导弹的问题已经引起争论，而西德参谋部的小册子却打算要求用这种导弹装备联邦“国防军”。社论说，使人感到最不安的是，在建立西德联邦国防军的法律批准才不过四年，西德将领们已经开始在参于政治领导。这家报纸要求西德联邦政府废弃联邦国防军的小册子和驱散它所引起的令人不愉快的回忆。
    英国“每日镜报”的评论员指出，西德复仇主义者提出这种要求并不奇怪，正如在过去德国军事历史中常常发生的一样，西德将军们正在提出政治权力上的要求。他在提醒这种危险性时说，“这并不稀奇，难道狼还会不吃人嚒？”
