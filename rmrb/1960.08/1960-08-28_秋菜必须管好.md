Autumn Vegetables Must Be Well Managed
People's Daily Commentator

This year, the broad masses of people in both urban and rural areas across the country are actively responding to the call of the Party and the government, vigorously planting and specially cultivating autumn vegetables. The area of vegetable fields has been expanded, and the planting of autumn vegetables has formed a vigorous mass movement. The situation on China's vegetable front is unprecedentedly good.

Planting autumn vegetables well is only the beginning of a bumper harvest. The final result depends on the work in the next few dozen days. Vegetables are a highly technical crop, especially requiring careful management. What should be done if some novice vegetable growers do not understand the technology? Are the water and fertilizer adequate for the many newly added vegetable fields? Vegetables are fresh, tender, and juicy, and are most vulnerable to pests, diseases, and frost damage. Are pest control medicines and equipment and frost prevention work ready? All these are problems that inevitably arise in the great development of vegetable production. Can these problems be solved? We believe that as long as the broad masses are mobilized as they were during planting, these problems can be completely solved.

To solve these problems, the most important thing is that leading cadres at all levels should grasp "management" as they grasp "planting." The Qinghemen People's Commune Party Committee in Fuxin City Suburbs, Liaoning Province, seeing that autumn vegetables were planted early and in large quantities this year, with many new vegetable fields and dense planting, placed vegetable field management in an important position. They not only concentrated more than 2,500 laborers to manage vegetable fields, but also mobilized more than 1,300 students and more than 500 auxiliary laborers to participate in vegetable field management. In this way, the labor problem was solved. They carried out red flag evaluation competitions and universally promoted the four-fix method of fixed plots, fixed tasks, fixed time, and fixed remuneration, checking each plot and supplementing as they checked. In three days, they completely replanted 140 hectares of vegetable fields that were 20% short of seedlings. The Minle Brigade of the Honghua People's Commune in Yinchuan City, Ningxia, planted many autumn vegetables this year, but lacked technical backbone. To solve this problem, they formed one or two vegetable professional groups in each production team, selected one or two commune members with vegetable growing experience to serve as group leaders, and implemented professional management. They also mobilized commune members to discuss and formulate field management technical measures and operating procedures with veteran vegetable farmers and technicians. In the process of discussion, the commune members learned techniques such as thinning seedlings, irrigating, topdressing, weeding, and preventing and controlling pests and diseases. These are all methods of relying on the masses to solve problems. As long as leading cadres at all levels fully and consciously use these methods, any difficulties can be overcome.

"Winter and spring vegetable supply depends on autumn," autumn vegetable production is a major event related to the lives of the broad masses of urban and rural people in winter and spring. At present, a high tide of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain has been set off across the country. Managing autumn vegetables well should become an important part of the current vigorous development of agriculture. Any region that plants vegetables well is conducive to arranging the lives of the masses and further improving public canteens. Areas that have suffered serious natural disasters should plant vegetables even more to conserve grain and prepare for famine. "Beginning of Autumn" has passed, and it is the key period for vegetable management. We must attach great importance to this matter, ensuring that we manage every mu we plant, every furrow we plant, managing to the end, starting well and finishing well, and ensuring that autumn vegetables increase production per mu and achieve a bumper harvest in every plot.

More than 400,000 jin of vegetables have now been harvested. In addition to self-sufficiency, more than 7,000 jin have also been supplied to the market. This is the staff picking eggplants.

    秋菜必须管好
    本报评论员
    今年，全国广大城乡人民积极响应党和政府的号召，大种特种秋季蔬菜。菜田面积扩大了，种植秋季蔬菜形成了声势浩大的群众运动，我国蔬菜战线的形势是空前的好。
    把秋菜种好，这仅仅是给秋菜的丰收开了一个头。结果到底如何，还要看今后几十天的工作。蔬菜是一种技术性很强的作物，特别需要精心管理，有些种菜新手不懂技术怎么办？新增加的许多菜田，水、肥到底够不够？蔬菜鲜嫩多汁，最容易遭受病虫、霜冻的危害，治虫药械和防霜工作准备好了没有？凡此种种，都是蔬菜生产大发展中必然发生的问题。这些问题能不能解决呢？我们认为，只要像种菜时候一样地把广大群众发动起来，这些问题都是完全可以解决的。
    解决这些问题，最要紧的一条，是各级领导干部要像抓“种”一样地把“管”抓起来。辽宁阜新市郊区清河门公社党委看到今年秋菜种的早、种的多、新菜田多、密植的又多，把菜田管理放在重要地位。他们不仅集中了两千五百多名劳动力管理菜田，还发动一千三百多名学生、五百多名辅助劳力参加管理菜田。这样，劳力问题就解决了。他们开展红旗评比竞赛，普遍推广了定地段、定任务、定时间、定报酬的四定办法，逐块检查，随查随补，三天工夫，把缺苗二成的一百四十垧菜地全部补上。宁夏银川市红花公社民乐大队今年种了许多秋菜，但是技术骨干不够。为了解决这个问题，他们在每个生产小队组成一两个蔬菜专业组，选派一两名有种菜经验的社员担任组长，实行专业管理；还发动社员跟老菜农、技术员一起，讨论制订田间管理技术措施和操作规程。社员在讨论的过程中，就学习了间苗、淌水、追肥、锄草、防治病虫等技术。这都是依靠群众解决问题的办法，各级领导干部只要充分地自觉地运用这种办法，任何困难都是可以克服的。
      “冬春吃菜靠一秋”，秋菜生产是关系全国广大城乡人民冬春两季生活的一件大事。目前，全国已经掀起大办农业、大办粮食的高潮，管好秋菜，应该成为当前大办农业的一个重要内容。任何地区种好蔬菜，都有利于安排群众生活，进一步办好公共食堂。遭受了严重的自然灾害的地区，更应该种好蔬菜，节粮备荒。“立秋”过了，正是蔬菜管理的关键时期，我们要十分重视这件事情，作到种一亩管一亩，种一畦管一畦，一管到底，善始善终，保证秋菜亩亩增产，块块丰收。（附图片）
