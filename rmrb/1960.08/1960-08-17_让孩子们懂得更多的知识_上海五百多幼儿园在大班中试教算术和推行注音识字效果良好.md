	Helping Children Learn More Knowledge
	Shanghai's Five Hundred Plus Kindergartens Achieve Good Results in Piloting Arithmetic and Promoting Phonetic Literacy in Senior Classes

	(Our report) Shanghai kindergartens are actively improving the quality of education, preparing children for primary school in terms of knowledge, ideology, moral character, and living habits.

	Since April, more than 500 public kindergartens and some private kindergartens with better teachers in the city have been piloting two courses, phonetic literacy and arithmetic, in senior classes. In the past, kindergartens did not teach literacy, but many children in senior classes had already learned to write their names with their parents' help. When reading picture books, they often asked teachers what the words on the books were. In order to satisfy children's desire for knowledge and the needs of primary school teaching reform, kindergartens are now piloting phonetic literacy and arithmetic.

	When teaching these two courses, kindergartens have adopted a variety of lively teaching methods based on the characteristics of young children, combining it with games, storytelling, singing, watching movies, visiting parks, etc., and using teaching aids such as pictures, blocks, and slides. When learning phonetic alphabets, the Shanghai Water Company Kindergarten teaches children to sing songs compiled with phonetic alphabets. Shanghai Experimental Kindergarten teaches children to read in activities such as singing, painting, and playing games. When singing songs about the people's commune, they teach them to recognize the words "people's commune," and when drawing Tiananmen, they write "Tiananmen." They also paste words such as "toy box" and "doll" on toys and doors and windows to deepen children's memory of these words. In the junior classes of kindergartens, teachers teach children to speak Mandarin, creating conditions for phonetic literacy.

	Currently, children in senior classes in kindergartens have learned the phonetic alphabet, and most can spell, read, and write, and can mark the four tones. Arithmetic in senior kindergarten classes has generally learned addition and subtraction within twenty, and can write numbers within one hundred.

	Kindergartens in Shanghai pay great attention to cultivating children's communist ideology and noble moral qualities from an early age. They integrate the education of loving the Party, the motherland, socialism, and labor, solidarity and mutual assistance into every detail of life, such as games, singing, and eating. They also often tell children stories of leaders, revolutionary predecessors, and heroic figures, and various new people and new events in the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes. The children in kindergartens all know that they must listen to Chairman Mao and be good children of Chairman Mao. Children in the senior class of Penglai Road Kindergarten want to write letters to Chairman Mao as soon as they learn Pinyin and recognize a few Chinese characters. It is very common for older children to help younger children bathe, get dressed, and give up their favorite games to help younger children do things.

	In order to let children have some understanding of school life before primary school, all kindergartens in the city have recently led senior class children to visit primary schools and have joint gatherings with primary school students. When the senior class children of Shanghai Experimental Kindergarten visited the No. 1 Cao Yang New Village Primary School, they saw that the students were very disciplined in class and raised their hands before speaking. When they came back, they all said they wanted to learn from the older brothers and sisters. In order to better connect with primary schools in terms of living habits and daily routines, many kindergartens have made a series of preparations since this year. For example, in the past, kindergartens only had two classes a day, each lasting twenty to twenty-five minutes. However, primary school students have four classes (in two shifts) in half a day, each lasting forty to forty-five minutes. Many children felt very uncomfortable when they first entered primary school. Now, some kindergartens have appropriately extended the class time for senior classes, and the number of classes per day has also been appropriately increased, so that children have a transition period in adapting to primary school life. Many kindergartens have also established fixed connections with primary schools, and kindergarten teachers and primary school teachers often visit each other, listen to each other's classes, and familiarize themselves with each other's teaching characteristics and children's lives, so that the education from kindergarten to primary school can be more closely coordinated.

### 让孩子们懂得更多的知识  上海五百多幼儿园在大班中试教算术和推行注音识字效果良好

    让孩子们懂得更多的知识
    上海五百多幼儿园在大班中试教算术和推行注音识字效果良好
    本报讯　上海各幼儿园积极提高教养工作质量，从知识、思想品德、生活习惯等方面，为孩子们进入小学作好准备。
    全市五百多个公立幼儿园和部分师资条件较好的民办幼儿园，从4月份开始在大班中试教注音识字和算术两门课程。过去幼儿园不教识字，但大班许多小朋友早已跟爸爸妈妈学会了写自己的名字；看小人书时，他们常常问老师书上写的是什么字。为了满足幼儿求知欲和小学教学改革的需要，现在幼儿园试教注音识字和算术两门课程。
    各幼儿园在教这两门课程的时候，都根据幼儿的特点，采取了多种多样的、生动活泼的教学方式，把它同做游戏、讲故事、唱歌、看电影、游公园等结合起来，并且运用了图片、积木、幻灯等教具。上海自来水公司幼儿园学拼音字母时，教孩子唱用拼音字母编成的歌。上海市实验幼儿园在唱歌、画画、游戏等活动中教孩子识字，唱人民公社的歌就教他们认识“人民公社”这几个字，画天安门就写“天安门”；并且在玩具和门、窗上贴上“玩具箱”、“布娃娃”等字，加深孩子们对这些字的记忆。在各幼儿园小班里，老师教孩子学习普通话，为注音识字创造条件。
    现在，各幼儿园大班的孩子们都学会了拼音字母，一般都会拼、会念、会写，并能标出四声。幼儿园大班的算术一般都已学会二十以内加减法，能写一百以内的数目字。
    上海市各个幼儿园，都很注意从小培养孩子们的共产主义思想和高尚的道德品质。他们把热爱党、热爱祖国、热爱社会主义和热爱劳动、团结互助的教育，贯穿在游戏、唱歌、吃饭等每一个生活细节中，并且经常给孩子们讲领袖的故事，讲革命前辈和英雄人物的故事，讲大跃进、人民公社中的各种新人新事，幼儿园的孩子们都懂得要听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好孩子。蓬莱路幼儿园大班幼儿们刚刚学会拼音、认识了几个汉字就要给毛主席写信。孩子们中，大的帮助小的洗澡、穿衣服，放弃自己最喜欢的游戏去帮助小班的弟弟妹妹做事，这已经是非常普遍的事情了。
    为了使孩子们在小学前就对学校的生活有所了解，最近全市各幼儿园都先后带领大班的孩子去小学参观和小学生联欢，上海市实验幼儿园大班的孩子参观曹杨新村第一小学的时候，看到学生们上课都非常守秩序，发言都先举手。回来以后都说要学大哥哥大姊姊的样子。许多幼儿园为了和小学在生活习惯、作息制度等方面也很好地衔接起来，今年以来先后作了一系列的准备。如过去幼儿园每天只上两节课，每节二十到二十五分钟。但小学生半天要上四节课（二部制），每节四十到四十五分钟。许多孩子刚进小学的时候感到很不习惯。现在一部分幼儿园已将大班上课时间适当延长，每天上课的节数也适当增加，使孩子们在适应小学生活方面有个过渡的过程。许多幼儿园还和小学对口挂钩，建立了固定联系，幼儿园的教养员和小学的教师经常互相参观、听课，熟悉彼此的教学特点和孩子们的生活，使幼儿园到小学的教育能够更紧密地配合起来。（附图片）
