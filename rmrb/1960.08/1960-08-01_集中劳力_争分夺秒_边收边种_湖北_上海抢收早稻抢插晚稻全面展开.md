Hubei Shanghai rush to harvest early rice and transplant late rice are fully unfolded
(Reported by this newspaper) The battle to rush harvest early rice and rush transplant late rice has been fully launched in various parts of Hubei Province. The areas along the Yangtze River are engaged in large-scale harvesting and transplanting, and the northwestern Hubei region, where the season is later, has also begun to use sickles.
The broad masses of peasants in Hubei Province have demonstrated soaring enthusiasm in rushing to harvest early rice and rush to transplant late rice. They are exchanging battle reports, engaging in competitions, racing against the season, striving for speed, ensuring quality, and carrying out high work efficiency movements. In Hanyang County, due to the development of the "Three Highs" (high work efficiency, high quality, high speed) movement, many fields achieved "golden paddies in the morning, green fields in the afternoon." As of July 23, the county had harvested more than 46,000 mu of early rice and rushed to transplant more than 22,000 mu of late rice. In addition, more than 17,000 mu of fields have been prepared. During the "Double Rush," cadres at all levels in Huanggang, Wuhan, and other regions have gone deep into the front lines of production, especially to backward areas, to set up camps and command on the spot. After the secretaries of the Taihe Commune in Echeng County went deep into the "Double Rush" front, they formed specialized groups for cutting rice, preparing fields, transplanting rice, and threshing according to the specialties of the commune members, and the work efficiency was significantly improved. At the same time, in order to support the "Double Rush" work, industrial and other departments in various places also organized a large number of workers and technicians to go to the countryside to repair various farm tools. In Huanggang Prefecture alone, more than 18,000 iron and woodworkers have been organized to go to the countryside recently, and more than 40,000 farm tools and more than 7,000 rice transplanters have been repaired.
In the "Double Rush," the broad masses of peasants in Hubei Province attached great importance to the careful harvesting and threshing of early rice. According to past experience, many regions mobilized commune members to discuss and formulate methods for careful harvesting and threshing as early as June. Qichun County, which has a large area of early rice, has formulated the following methods: 1. Cut and place gently to reduce broken stalks and grain loss; 2. When holding the rice, hold less, walk quickly, and place gently to prevent ears and grains from falling; 3. Bundles should not lose grains, and fallen grains should not fall on the ground; 4. When transporting rice, tie and carry at the same time; 5. Organize the elderly and children to pick up stalks and sweep up grains. Many regions have also strengthened the management of fields and threshing grounds during the rush to harvest early rice in order to get all the bountiful early rice.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th
The suburban counties of Shanghai have made rapid progress in the rush to harvest double-season early rice and rush to plant double-season late rice.
At present, most of the early rice in the suburbs has turned yellow and ripe, and Songjiang, Jinshan, Fengxian, Qingpu, Nanhui and other counties have started harvesting. Songjiang County, which started harvesting earlier, had harvested more than half of the crop by the 26th; Fengxian County, which started harvesting later, had also harvested more than 12,000 mu. While harvesting early rice, various localities are seizing the season with a spirit of racing against time, plowing, fertilizing, and rushing to transplant double-season late rice.
This year, the area of double-season rice to be rushed to harvest and plant in the suburbs is larger than in previous years, the requirements are higher, and the seasonality is stronger, while there are many farm tasks currently, so labor is particularly tight. Therefore, before the rush to harvest, all communes successively held meetings to widely carry out ideological mobilization; at the same time, from the organizational and material aspects, various effective measures were taken to comprehensively arrange and concentrate superior forces to carry out assaults. In order to ensure that there is sufficient labor during the rush to harvest and plant, Qingpu County advanced the second weeding and topdressing and fertilizer accumulation of rice, which were originally planned to be completed before the Beginning of Autumn. The communes also established command posts, with the commune party committee secretary as the commander, and set up three detachments for harvesting, transplanting seedlings, and threshing. Production teams established specialized teams and shock teams for harvesting, plowing, pulling seedlings, and transplanting seedlings. In order to organize the support forces from all aspects well and give full play to their role, this year, the double-season early rice in this county, from threshing, drying, weighing to warehousing, is all contracted by cadres of government offices, workers, teachers, students, shop employees, and urban street residents. The counties also equipped the threshing machinery with technicians and commune members to work together. Under the slogan of ensuring that the late-season rice is planted on time, with quality and quantity, Jinshan County arranged 40% of the labor force to rush to accumulate fertilizer before the rush to harvest and plant began, and transported the fertilizer to the fields in advance to ensure that the late-season rice had 25 to 30 dan of base fertilizer per mu.
After the rush to harvest and plant began, the whole party and the whole people in Qingpu, Jinshan, Fengxian, Songjiang and other counties were mobilized, and workers, peasants, merchants, students and soldiers all joined this battle. As of the 25th, Qingpu County had more than 11,000 cadres from county-level organs, workers, teachers, students, shop employees, and urban residents participating in early rice harvesting and threshing. With the support of all parties, the members of Liantang Commune harvested more than 2,600 mu on the 25th alone. Many county, commune, and team cadres went deep into the front lines to participate in the "Double Rush" and command the "Double Rush." Jinshan County is vigorously carrying out mass movements and launching red flag competitions, striving to achieve a bumper harvest of early rice and transplanting late rice on time, with quality and quantity.

    湖北  上海抢收早稻抢插晚稻全面展开
    本报讯　湖北各地抢收早稻和抢插晚稻的战斗已经全面展开。长江两岸地区正在大收大插，季节较迟的鄂西北地区也开始动镰。
    湖北省广大农民在抢收早稻和抢插晚稻中，表现了冲天干劲，他们互送战表，大搞竞赛，抢季节，争速度，保质量，开展高工效运动。汉阳县由于开展了“三高”（高工效、高质量、高速度）运动，许多田做到了“上午满畈黄、下午披绿装”。到7月23日止，全县已割早稻四万六千多亩，抢插晚稻二万二千多亩。另外，还整好田一万七千多亩。在“双抢”中，黄冈、武汉等地区的各级干部都深入到生产第一线，特别是到落后地区安营扎寨，就地指挥。鄂城县太和公社各级书记深入到“双抢”前线后，根据社员特长分别组成割谷、整田、插秧、脱粒等专业小组，工效显著提高。和这同时，为了支援“双抢”工作，各地工业等部门还组织大批工人、技术人员下乡抢修各种农具。仅黄冈专区最近组织下乡的铁、木工人就达一万八千多人，已经整修农具四万多件，插秧机七千多部。
    湖北省广大农民在“双抢”中，十分重视早稻的精收细打。许多地区根据历年经验，早在6月间就发动社员讨论制定了有关细收细打的办法。早稻面积较大的圻春县制定了以下办法：一、轻割、轻放，减少断刁掉粒；二、抱谷时要少抱、快走、轻放，防止掉穗落粒；三、捆把不掉粒，掉粒不落地；四、运稻头实行边捆边挑，随捆随挑；五、组织老人、小孩拣刁扫粒。许多地区在抢收早稻中还加强了对田间和稻场的管理，以便把丰收的早稻全部拿到手。
    新华社上海29日电　上海市郊区各县，抢收双季早稻和抢种双季晚稻进展迅速。
    目前，郊区各地早稻大多已经黄熟，松江、金山、奉贤、青浦、南汇等县都已开镰收割。收割较早的松江县，到26日止，已收割过半；奉贤县收割较晚，也已收割一万二千多亩。在收割早稻的同时，各地正以分秒必争的精神，抓紧季节，边收边耕边施肥，抢插双季晚稻。
    今年郊区双季稻抢收抢种的面积比往年大，要求高，季节性强，而当前农活繁多，因此劳力特别紧张。为此在抢收前，各公社都先后召开会议，广泛进行思想发动；同时从组织上、物质上，采取各种有效措施，全面安排，集中优势兵力进行突击。青浦县为了保证在抢收抢种期间能有充分的劳力，把原计划在立秋前完成的水稻第二次耘耥和追肥、积肥等工作都提前进行。各公社还成立了指挥部，由公社党委书记任指挥，下设收割、种秧、脱粒三个中队。生产队则成立了收割、耕地、拔秧、种秧等专业队和突击队。为了把各方面的支援力量很好地组织起来，充分发挥作用，这个县今年双季早稻从脱粒、翻晒、过磅到入库，全部由机关干部、工人、师生、商店职工和城镇街道居民包下来。各县还对脱粒机械配备了懂得技术的工人和社员一起工作。在保证按时、按质、按量种好后季稻的口号下，金山县在抢收抢种开始以前，就安排了40％的劳力突击积肥，并提前将肥料运到田头，确保后季稻每亩有基肥二十五到三十担。
    抢收抢种开始以后，青浦、金山、奉贤、松江等县全党全民总动员，工农商学兵一齐投入了这个战斗。青浦县在25日起已有县级机关干部、工人、师生、商店职工和城镇居民一万一千多人，参加早稻收割和脱粒工作。练塘公社社员在各方面支援下，仅25日一天就收割了二千六百多亩。许多县、社、队干部都深入第一线，参加“双抢”，指挥“双抢”。金山县正在大搞群众运动，开展红旗竞赛，力争做到早稻丰产丰收，晚稻按质按量按时插上。
