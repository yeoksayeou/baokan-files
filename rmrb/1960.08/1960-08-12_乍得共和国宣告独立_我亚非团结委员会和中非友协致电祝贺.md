Xinhua News Agency, Fort-Lamy, August 11th: The Republic of Chad, located in north equatorial Africa, formally declared its independence today.

This morning, an independence declaration ceremony was held in the nation's capital, Fort-Lamy. The Prime Minister of the Republic of Chad, François Tombalbaye, announced the independence of the Republic of Chad and raised the blue, yellow, and red flag of the Republic of Chad. Before the declaration of independence, French Minister of State André Malraux, representing the French government, and Tombalbaye exchanged documents concerning the transfer of power by France. It was announced that the independent Republic of Chad would remain within the adjusted "French Community."

The news said that due to the rainy season in Chad during the summer and autumn, causing transportation difficulties, the formal independence celebrations will be held on January 11th of next year.

Before its independence, Chad was a member state of the "French Community," with an area of over 1,280,000 square kilometers and a population of 2,570,000. Since the invasion of the country by French colonialists in the mid-19th century, the people there have continuously launched struggles against foreign colonial rule for national independence.

The telegram said, "Chad's declaration of independence is the result of the long-term struggle of the Chadian people against imperialism and colonialism. The Chinese people have always supported the just struggle of the Chadian people for national independence and against colonialism. On this joyous occasion, we wish the people of your country continuous achievements and progress in consolidating independence, developing the national economy, and fighting against imperialism and colonialism, and we wish the friendship between the Chinese and Chadian peoples will grow day by day."
