    "Points" and "Surfaces"
    Tao Youzhi, Worker of Shanghai Tongxing Industrial Cooperative

    A tiny "point" may seem insignificant at first glance, merely a fraction of a surface. In the past, some comrades believed that "points" were not important or crucial, so they didn't pay much attention to them. They felt differently about "surfaces," knowing that they represented a whole, a complete picture, and were very important. Therefore, they focused on grasping "surfaces" tightly, spending day and night in the office, rarely concerning themselves with "points."

    Comrades who have studied geometry know the relationship between "points and surfaces." "Points and surfaces" are inseparable. Although a surface is large, it cannot exist without points. Although a point is small, it is an essential and original component of the "surface." As we know, a point moving forms a line, and a line moving forms a surface. So, if we don't start from a point, where will the "surface" come from? Of course, we can't be shortsighted and only see the point. If there are only "points" and no surfaces, then the "point" will have no effect.

    Therefore, a good leading cadre always grasps both the surface and the point. They observe the overall situation from a comprehensive perspective and start from a point. They understand the tasks of the entire region and factory, and make overall plans. However, their concrete actions always begin with a point, conducting pilot projects and establishing models in a small team, workshop, section, or even a group. They gain experience, understand the rules, and then promote, introduce, and develop them comprehensively, forming an overall leap forward.

    Chairman Mao pointed out in his article "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership" long ago: "In all the practical work of our Party, all correct leadership is necessarily 'from the masses, to the masses'. This means: take the ideas of the masses (scattered and unsystematic ideas) and concentrate them (through study turn them into concentrated and systematic ideas), then go to the masses and propagate and explain these ideas until the masses embrace them as their own, hold on to them and translate them into action, and test the correctness of these ideas in such action." "All work done for the masses must start from their needs and not from the desire of any individual, however well-intentioned. It often happens that objectively the masses need a certain change, but subjectively they are not yet conscious of it, are not yet willing or determined to make it. In such cases, we should wait patiently. We should not make the change until, through our work, most of the masses have become conscious of the need and are willing and determined to carry it out. Otherwise, we shall isolate ourselves from the masses." It is thus clear that the connection between the general and the particular is so close. Without the general, there is certainly no particular, but without the particular, the general will also fall through.

    Chairman Mao's discussion of the general and the particular is, in fact, a question of "points and surfaces." If you want to grasp the surface, and want a large-scale harvest, if you want an all-round leap forward and comprehensively complete the plan, you must start with a point, starting from a group or a workshop, be down-to-earth, go deep into reality, and solve the problems existing in the work in a timely and specific manner, gain experience, and then promote it comprehensively.

    "Surfaces" certainly cannot be ignored, but "points" must not be neglected either. We should learn to combine the general and the particular in order to do our work well.

### “点”和“面”

    “点”和“面”
    上海同兴实业社工人　陶友之
    细细的一“点”，初看起来是显得很渺小，它不过是面的多少分之一。过去有个别同志就认为“点”不是什么重要关键，不加重视，而对“面”就不同了，他们知道这是一个整体，是一个全局，非常重要，因此就抓得很紧，对“点”就很少过问，日夜就在办公室里抓“面”。
    学习过几何的同志都知道“点与面”的关系。“点与面”是不可分割的，面虽大，但离不开点，点虽小，但它却是“面”的重要组成部分，而且是元始。大家知道，点移动成线，线移动成面，可见如果不从一点开始，那又有何“面”。当然，也不能鼠目寸光只看到点，如果只有“点”没有面，这个“点”也就没有作用。
    所以一个好的领导干部，他总是既抓面，又抓点，放眼从全面观看，着手从一点出发，看清全地区、全厂任务，全面规划。而具体行动，却又先从一点开始，在一个小队、在一个车间、一个工段，甚至于一个小组中搞试点，搞典型，得出经验，摸清规律，然后再向全面推广、介绍、发展，形成全面跃进。
    毛主席在《关于领导方法的若干问题》一文中，早向我们指出过：“我们共产党人无论进行何项工作，有两个方法是必须采用的，一是一般和个别相结合，二是领导和群众相结合。”“任何工作任务，如果没有一般的普遍的号召，就不能动员广大群众行动起来。但如果只限于一般号召，而领导人员没有具体地直接地从若干组织将所号召的工作深入实施，突破一点，取得经验，然后利用这种经验去指导其他单位，就无法考验自己提出的一般号召是否正确，也无法充实一般号召的内容，就有使一般号召归于落空的危险。”由此可见，一般与个别联系是如此之密切。没有一般，固然谈不上个别，但如果没有个别，也就会使一般落空。
    毛主席所谈的一般和个别问题的论断，事实也是“点与面”的问题。你要抓面，想大面积丰收，你要想全面跃进，全面完成计划，你就得先从一点做起，从一个小组、一个车间着手，踏踏实实，深入实际，及时地具体地解决工作中存在的问题，搞出经验，再向全面推广。
    “面”固然不能忽视，但“点”也决不能少，我们应该学会一般和个别相结合的方法，才能做好工作。
