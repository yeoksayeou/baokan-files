Xinhua News Agency, San José, 29th: The plenary session of the Organization of American States' meeting of foreign ministers on the evening of the 28th passed a resolution interfering in Cuba's internal affairs and facilitating the United States' strengthening of its control over Latin American countries, despite the firm opposition of the Cuban delegation and their withdrawal from the meeting. This resolution was forcibly passed after the United States engaged in the most blatant threats and inducements toward Latin American countries in order to cope with the divisions at the meeting and reverse its isolated trend. However, the situation at the meeting showed that the United States encountered strong resistance from many Latin American countries in imposing its sinister plot on the meeting. Even United Press International had to admit on the 28th that the United States "found" that the progress of this stage of the meeting, which it had arranged for further interference in Cuba, was "unimaginably arduous."

The resolution passed by the meeting, titled the "Declaration of San José," stated that it "emphatically condemns the intervention or threatened intervention by extra-continental powers in the affairs of the American states," and stated that it "opposes and rejects" "any threat to any American state from any extra-continental power." The resolution also stated that it "rejects" the unfounded, fabricated so-called Soviet and Chinese "attempts to disrupt continental solidarity and endanger the peace and security of this hemisphere" concocted by the United States. These two points of the resolution, which reversed black and white and were absurd and unreasonable, were drafted according to the basic arguments of the draft resolution proposed by the United States, the purpose of which was to create a pretext for the United States to launch further intervention against Cuba, but the United States was unable to make the meeting "condemn" Cuba by name according to its original draft resolution.

The resolution also reiterated, according to the will of the United States, the "Declaration of Santiago" which the United States manipulated the meeting of ministers of foreign affairs of American states to pass in August last year in order to interfere in Cuba, and declared that all member states of the Organization of American States must reaffirm their trust in the "Pan-American system" and abide by its "discipline," while the "Pan-American system" is precisely a set of shackles that the United States has consistently used to interfere in and control Latin American countries, including Cuba.

The resolution "reaffirms the principle of non-intervention by one American state in the internal or external affairs of other American states," but at the same time reaffirms the right of each country to develop its national life "with respect for human rights and general moral principles." As is well known, these platitudes of so-called "respect for human rights" are excuses that the United States has consistently used to slander and interfere in Cuba. The resolution also stated that disputes between American countries should be resolved "through peaceful means."

The meeting also decided to establish a committee to "help resolve Cuban-American differences" and "monitor problems arising in the Caribbean region." It is extremely obvious that the United States will use this committee as a tool for it to further interfere in Cuba and control Central American countries.

Before the above resolution was passed, Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa had spoken out to condemn US aggression against Cuba. He said that Cuba was under "constant threat of aggression" from the United States. He requested the meeting to reconsider Cuba's draft resolution condemning US aggression against Cuba. However, Cuba's draft resolution was rejected under US manipulation. Then, during the vote on this resolution, Roa angrily led the Cuban delegation out of the meeting after voting against the first two points of the resolution. Roa emphatically stated that Cuba would not recognize the meeting's resolution condemning so-called "interference from countries outside the continent." He said that Cuba gratefully accepts help from any country. Roa finally stated that the Cuban people will continue to fight. He stressed that the Latin American people are with Cuba. Roa's speech was met with warm applause and cheers from the audience in the hall. Many audience members shouted: "Cuba, yes! Yankees, no!" "Down with imperialism!"

As the Cuban delegation left the meeting, they shouted: "Cuba, yes! Yankees, no!" As they approached the hotel where they were staying, the Cuban delegation sang the Cuban national anthem and shouted the slogan "Defend the motherland to the death." At this time, a large number of San José citizens flocked to the front of the Cuban delegation's residence to express their support for Cuba's position. Costa Rican police immediately blockaded the streets leading to the hotel to prevent the masses from holding anti-American demonstrations.

The resolution of this meeting was the result of the US delegation's manipulation of intrigues and exertion of strong pressure. In the discussions in the plenary sessions for several days, many Latin American countries' representatives spoke out to indicate their unwillingness to follow the US position of interfering in Cuba. The day before the United States formally submitted a proposal demanding that the meeting specifically condemn Cuba on the 26th, Mexico, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Honduras and other seven countries submitted a draft resolution which, in addition to "requiring the Cuban government to express its belief in Americanism", also stated: "Cuba has the right to follow the path it deems most appropriate to realize the hopes of its own people, and it alone has the right to decide this; it is hereby declared: the American republics will continue to support the fraternal Republic of Cuba's struggle to improve the economy and realize social justice." After the US proposal was put forward, the meeting immediately showed obvious divisions. It was reported that many countries supporting the above-mentioned seven-nation proposal opposed any suggestion of criticizing Cuba, even implicitly, and they also advocated condemning not only so-called "foreign interference" but also any kind of interference. On the 26th, the meeting appointed a ten-nation committee to "bridge the rift" and formulate a final draft resolution, but divisions of opinion arose within this ten-nation committee as well. United Press International's report on the 27th admitted that before the final draft was formed, "the conciliatory attitude of the Latin American delegations initially surprised the United States very much. After twenty-four hours of confusion, a series of resolution clauses were drafted and overturned." Only under strong pressure from the United States did many "countries that have always insisted on not attacking Cuba" "gradually begin to divide."

In view of the great contradictions at the meeting and the danger of the US plot to interfere in Cuba completely failing, the US delegation personnel, including US Secretary of State Herter and Assistant Secretary of State Rubottom, launched particularly frenzied activities near the end of the meeting on the 26th and 27th, and they desperately threatened and lured the Latin American countries' representatives separately. United Press International reported that "Herter personally came forward to reiterate his firm opinion" and insisted on "using clear wording" to oppose generally talking about "Pan-American principles." In the meantime, the US delegation once again used the dollar stick to force some Latin American countries to submit. Reuters reported on the 28th: "US representatives want their Latin American colleagues to understand this: if [they] fail to support a resolution that clearly criticizes Cuba's behavior, it will definitely reduce the sympathy of [the US] Congress for future requests for expanded aid to Latin America." Relying on all these shameless and brutal means, the United States barely eliminated the opposition and reservations of many countries and forcibly passed the aforementioned resolution.

United Press International quoted Washington diplomatic sources on the 28th as admitting that this meeting "has prominently exposed all the complexities in US-Latin American relations." These sources expressed concern that "Latin America will probably still be one of the main problems that causes headaches for the United States for some time to come." At the same time, the outcome of the meeting created by the United States under high-pressure tactics made the representatives of many Latin American countries feel worried and uneasy. According to a report by Agence France-Presse on the 29th, there was a kind of "frustration" among the representatives of Latin American countries participating in this meeting, "Some representatives felt that the attitude their delegation adopted at the meeting might have repercussions in the public opinion of their own countries."

According to United Press International, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Arcaya had already announced his resignation as the head of the Venezuelan delegation and returned home early before the end of the meeting on the 27th. He told reporters that he was unwilling to sign the meeting's resolution. This news agency also reported that Peruvian Foreign Minister Barras Porras Barrenechea also expressed dissatisfaction with the resolution passed by the meeting.

### 美国强使美洲国家外长会议通过干涉古巴的决议  古巴代表痛斥美国侵略罪行  声明拒绝接受会议决议并退出会场表示抗议

    美国强使美洲国家外长会议通过干涉古巴的决议
    古巴代表痛斥美国侵略罪行
    声明拒绝接受会议决议并退出会场表示抗议
    新华社29日讯　圣约瑟消息：28日晚间举行的美洲国家组织成员国外长会议的全体会议在古巴代表团的坚决反对和退出会议的情况下，通过一项干涉古巴内部事务和便于美国加强控制拉丁美洲国家的决议。这项决议是在美国为对付会上的分歧和挽回它的孤立趋势而对拉丁美洲国家进行了最露骨的威胁利诱以后被强行通过的。但是，会议情况表明，美国在把它的凶恶图谋强加于会议的过程中，曾经遭到来自许多拉丁美洲国家的强大阻力。甚至合众国际社在28日也不得不承认，美国“发现”，它为进一步干涉古巴而安排的这一阶段的会议的进程是“想像不到的艰辛”。
    会议通过的这项以“圣约瑟宣言”为名的决议表示“着重谴责大陆以外国家对美洲国家事务的干涉或干涉威胁”，并且表示“反对和拒绝”“任何美洲国家接受任何大陆以外的威胁”。决议还表示“拒绝”美国一手臆造的莫须有的所谓苏联和中国“破坏大陆团结和危害本半球和平和安全的企图”。决议的这两点颠倒黑白、荒诞无理的内容，是按照美国提出的决议草案的基本论点拟订的，其目的是为美国发动对古巴的进一步干涉制造口实，但是，美国没有能够使会议根据它的原决议草案指名“谴责”古巴。
    决议还根据美国的意旨，重申了美国为干涉古巴而在去年8月操纵美洲国家外长会议通过的“圣地亚哥宣言”，并且宣称美洲国家组织所有的成员国都必须重申对“泛美体系”的信任和遵守它的“纪律”，而“泛美体系”正是美国一贯用来干涉和控制包括古巴在内的拉丁美洲国家的一套枷锁。
    决议“重申一个美洲国家不干涉其他美洲国家的内政和外交事务的原则”，但是同时又重申各国有权在“尊重人权和一般道德原则”下发展国家生活。如所周知，所谓“尊重人权”这些滥调是美国一贯用来诬蔑和干涉古巴的借口。决议还声明应该“通过和平手段”来解决美洲各国间的争端。
    会议同时决定成立一个委员会来“帮助解决古—美分歧”和“监督在加勒比海地区出现的问题”。极其明显，美国将利用这个委员会作为它进一步干涉古巴和控制中美国家的工具。
    在通过上述决议以前，古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚曾经发言谴责美国对古巴的侵略。他说，古巴处于来自美国的“经常的侵略威胁之中”。他要求会议重新考虑古巴提出的关于谴责美国侵略古巴的决议草案。但是，古巴的这项决议草案在美国操纵下遭到否决。接着，在投票表决这项决议时，罗亚在投票反对决议的前两项内容后，愤然率领古巴代表团退出会议。罗亚强调声明，古巴将不承认会议关于谴责所谓“来自大陆以外的国家的干涉”的决议。他说，古巴感谢地接受来自任何国家的帮助。罗亚最后表示，古巴人民将继续进行战斗。他着重指出，拉丁美洲人民同古巴在一起。罗亚的发言博得会场中旁听者的热烈掌声和欢呼。许多旁听者高呼：“要古巴，不要美国佬！”“打倒帝国主义！”
    古巴代表团在离开会场时高呼：“要古巴，不要美国佬！”在走近他们住的旅馆时，古巴代表团高唱古巴国歌，并且高呼“誓死保卫祖国”的口号。这时，大批圣约瑟市民拥向古巴代表团的住所前，表示支持古巴的立场。哥斯达黎加警察立即封锁住通往旅馆的各条街道，防止人民群众举行反美示威。
    这次会议的决议是美国代表团玩弄阴谋手段和施加强大的压力的结果。几天来在全体会议的讨论中有不少拉丁美洲国家代表发言表明不愿意追随美国干涉古巴的立场。在26日美国正式提出提案，要求会议指名谴责古巴的前一天，墨西哥、委内瑞拉、玻利维亚、厄瓜多尔、巴拿马、秘鲁、洪都拉斯等七国就提出一项决议草案，其中除了“要求古巴政府表示对美洲主义的信念”外，还声明：“古巴有权利走它自己认为最适宜的道路来实现其本国人民的希望，而且也只有它才有权决定这一点，兹宣告：美洲各共和国将继续支持兄弟般的古巴共和国为改善经济和实现社会正义而进行的斗争”。在美国提案提出以后，会议立即发生明显的分歧，据报道，支持上述七国提案的许多国家反对任何甚至是隐晦地指责古巴的建议，它们还主张谴责不仅是所谓“外来干涉”而且是任何种类的干涉。26日，会议任命了一个十国委员会来“弥补裂痕”和制订最后的决议草案，但是就在这个十国委员会内部又发生意见分歧。合众国际社27日消息承认，在最后草案形成之前，“拉丁美洲各国代表团的和解态度起初使美国十分惊讶。经过了二十四小时的混乱，其间一系列决议的条文拟好了又被推翻”。只是在美国的强大压力下，许多“向来坚持不攻击古巴的国家”才“逐渐开始分化”。
    鉴于会议上的矛盾很大、美国干涉古巴的阴谋有完全落空的危险，包括美国国务卿赫脱和助理国务卿鲁博特姆在内的美国代表团人员在26日27日会议接近最后关头时展开了特别狂热的活动，他们分头拼命向拉丁美洲国家代表进行威胁和利诱。合众国际社消息说，“赫脱亲自出马重申他的坚定的意见”，并且坚持要“使用明确的措辞”而反对一般地谈论“泛美原则”。在这中间，美国代表团又一次使用了美元大棒来迫使一些拉丁美洲国家就范，路透社28日消息写道：“美国代表们要他们的拉丁美洲同僚了解这一点：如果（它们）未能支持一个明确批评古巴行为的决议，那就一定会减少（美国）国会对于未来扩大援助拉丁美洲的要求的同情。”依靠这一切无耻而粗暴的手段，美国才勉强排除了许多国家的反对和保留意见，而强行通过了上述决议。
    合众国际社28日援引华盛顿的外交人士的话承认，这次会议“已经使得美国和拉丁美洲关系中的全部复杂性突出地暴露出来”。这些人士表示担心，“在今后一个时候拉丁美洲大概仍将是主要使美国感到头痛的问题之一”。与此同时，美国在高压手段下所造成的会议的结局，使许多拉丁美洲国家的代表感到忧虑不安。据法新社29日消息透露，在参加这次会议的拉丁美洲国家代表中间存在着一种“沮丧情绪”，“有一些代表感觉到他们代表团在会议中所采取的态度可能会在他们自己的国家的公众舆论里产生反响”。
    据合众国际社报道，委内瑞拉外交部长阿卡亚已经在27日会议结束以前宣布辞去委内瑞拉代表团团长的职务并先期回国，他对记者表示他不愿意签署会议的决议。这家通讯社还报道，秘鲁外交部长巴拉斯·波雷内切亚也对会议通过的决议表示不满。
