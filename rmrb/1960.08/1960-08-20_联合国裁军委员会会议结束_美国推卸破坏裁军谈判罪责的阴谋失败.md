Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 19th (Tass): The United Nations Disarmament Committee concluded its three-day meeting on the evening of August 18th. The committee unanimously adopted a proposal put forward by six countries including India, Mexico, and the United Arab Republic. The committee's resolution recommends that the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly seriously discuss the disarmament issue. Given the urgency of this issue, the committee also believes and recommends that continued efforts be made to swiftly resume international negotiations in order to constructively resolve the issue of comprehensive and complete disarmament under effective international supervision.

    In explaining the Soviet delegation's reason for voting, Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet delegation and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, said that the Soviet delegation voted in favor of the six-nation proposal because it recommended a serious discussion of the disarmament issue at the next session of the United Nations General Assembly. He also pointed out that the proposal did not recognize the importance of the participation of heads of government or heads of state in the meeting, although this proposition was endorsed by many delegations. He said that the Soviet side hopes that all member states of the United Nations will take a responsible attitude towards the discussion of the disarmament issue at the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and hopes that the heads of state or heads of government of these countries will participate in the meeting.

    In this way, the United Nations Disarmament Committee, which lasted for three days, actually turned against those who insisted on convening this meeting—the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. Their attempt to shift the responsibility for the failure of the Geneva Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee onto the socialist countries suffered a miserable defeat. Their conspiracy to obstruct a detailed discussion of the disarmament issue at the United Nations General Assembly's meeting next month also failed.

    联合国裁军委员会会议结束
    美国推卸破坏裁军谈判罪责的阴谋失败
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社纽约19日讯：联合国裁军委员会在举行了三天会议后于8月18日晚上结束。委员会一致通过了印度、墨西哥、阿拉伯联合共和国等六个国家提出的一项提案。委员会的决议建议联合国大会第十五届会议认真讨论裁军问题。鉴于这个问题的迫切性，委员会还认为并建议继续努力以求迅速恢复国际谈判，以便建设性地解决在有效的国际监督下全面彻底裁军问题。
    苏联代表团团长、苏联外交部副部长库兹涅佐夫在阐述苏联代表团的投票理由时说，苏联代表团投票同意六国提案，因为这个提案建议下届联合国大会上认真讨论裁军问题。他还指出，这个提案没有承认政府或国家首脑参加会议的重要性，尽管这个主张得到许多代表团的赞同。他说，苏联代表希望，联合国所有会员国将认真负责地对待联合国大会第十五届会议上的裁军问题的讨论，并希望，这些国家有国家元首或政府首脑参加会议。
    这样一来，持续三天的联合国裁军委员会实际上反过头来反对那些坚持召开这次会议的人——美国和它的北大西洋公约组织的盟国。它们企图在这次会议上把日内瓦十国裁军委员会的不成功的责任转嫁给社会主义国家，这个阴谋遭到惨败。它们企图阻挠在联合国大会下个月的会议上详细地讨论裁军问题的阴谋也没有得逞。
