Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 27th -- Radio of the Lao Fighting Forces broadcast today: People in various provinces of Laos are rising up to oppose the conspiracy of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group to advance on Vientiane.

    In Lower Laos, the people have organized propaganda teams to promote the propositions of the coup committee and express their support for the correct policies announced by the Phouma government and the statement of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front. The propaganda teams are supported by the people wherever they go.

    In Pakse Province, the people's armed forces also captured some troops sent by Phoumi Nosavan to Latin.

    Recently, many leaflets have appeared in cities and villages in the provinces of Lower Laos, reading: "The Chao Songsavath government has completely lost power," "The people and the army must rise up against the reactionary Phoumi Nosavan group."

    In Sam Neua Province, many village and county chiefs have sworn to the people that they will resolutely not implement the instructions of the reactionary Phoumi Nosavan group and are willing to act in accordance with the wishes of the people.

    In Mok Mai District, Xieng Khouang Province, more than 1,000 Lao Sung people held a meeting to support the call of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, expressing their determination to smash the traitorous conspiracy of the Phoumi Nosavan group. After the meeting, the local people organized armed forces to prepare to resist the traitorous Phoumi Nosavan group.

    In Bassen, Luang Prabang Province, more than 1,000 young people and guerrillas organized many armed teams to prepare to resist the traitorous Phoumi Nosavan group and defend Vientiane.
