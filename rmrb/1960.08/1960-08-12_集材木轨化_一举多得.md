    Report from this newspaper: The Greater Khingan Range Forest Area in Inner Mongolia has replaced horses and tractors with wooden rails and new tools for timber skidding, achieving multiple benefits.
    In the past, the Greater Khingan Range Forest Area mainly used horses and tractors for timber skidding. This type of skidding tool caused serious damage to young trees and the soil layer, which was not conducive to forest regeneration and soil and water conservation. Moreover, during the peak season of timber production in winter, a large number of horse teams had to be recruited from rural areas to support timber skidding. This not only affected rural production but also increased timber production costs. At the same time, transporting horses and fodder consumed a large amount of railway transportation capacity.
    After implementing rail-based skidding, more than 3,000 horses and more than 150 tractors can be saved and invested in agricultural production, short-distance transportation, and other aspects of production. In the future, it will not be necessary to recruit a large number of animal power from rural areas to go to the mountains, which will reduce the burden on rural areas and railway transportation.
    Implementing rail-based skidding generally improves efficiency by half to one time compared with horse-based skidding, and significantly reduces timber costs. Moreover, since the skidding route is fixed, the damage to young trees is reduced to a minimum, and the destruction of the soil layer is also greatly reduced, creating favorable conditions for forest regeneration.

### 集材木轨化　一举多得

    集材木轨化　一举多得
    本报讯　内蒙古大兴安岭林区用木轨道和新工具代替牛马和拖拉机集材，获得了一举多得的效果。
    过去，大兴安岭林区的集材工具一直是以使用牛马套子和拖拉机为主。这种集材工具破坏幼树和土层较严重，不利于森林更新和水土保持。而且，每到冬季木材生产黄金季节，还要到农村招来大批马套子支援集材。既影响农村生产，又提高了木材生产成本。同时，运送马匹、草料，还消耗了大量火车运力。
    集材实行轨道化以后，可以节省下来三千多匹牛马和一百五十多台拖拉机，投入农业生产和短途运输以及参加其他方面的生产。今后也不用再去农村大量招募畜力上山，给农村和铁路运输减少不少负担。
    集材实行轨道化，一般的比牛马集材提高效率半倍到一倍左右，并使木材成本显著降低。而且由于集材线路固定，对幼树的损伤减少到最低限度，也大大减少了土层的破坏，为森林更新创造了良好条件。
