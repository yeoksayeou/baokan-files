Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 8th: According to "l'Humanité," the Martinique Communist Party held its Second Congress in Morne-Rouge, northern Martinique, on July 30th and 31st.

	The island of Martinique is part of the French West Indies in the Caribbean Sea (the other part being Guadeloupe).

	Nicolas delivered the work report of the Central Committee at the meeting. The congress formulated a policy on Martinique's struggle for national autonomy and pointed out that imperialism is currently in a state of disintegration around the world. Former French dependencies have successively gained independence. In Latin America, in the Caribbean, in Venezuela, and in Cuba, a storm is sweeping through as the peoples of various oppressed countries strive for liberation.

	The Martinique Communist Party regards striving to build an anti-colonialist front on the island of Martinique and striving to achieve Martinique's autonomy within the Antilles-Guiana Federation as its central task.

	During the congress, Communist and Workers' Parties of twenty-four countries sent congratulatory telegrams to the congress.

	On August 1st, the Martinique Communist Party held a grand rally in Fort-de-France to celebrate the successful conclusion of the party's Second Congress. Representatives of the Communist Parties of France, Venezuela, and Cuba participated in the rally and spoke at the meeting. The congress proceeded in a very warm atmosphere from beginning to end. The masses attending the congress warmly applauded and cheered the party's political line of striving for autonomy for the island of Martinique. The congress ended with the singing of The Internationale.

	During the Second Congress of the Martinique Communist Party, the Communist Parties of Cuba, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Venezuela held talks and issued a joint statement.

	The statement said, "The characteristic of the situation in the Antilles and Latin America is that the struggle of the people of various countries to free their countries from imperialist and colonialist rule, to strive for freedom, and to strive for the economic and social development of their countries is generally rising. When the U.S. imperialists are currently openly threatening to intervene to strangle the Cuban people's revolution and independence; when the U.S. imperialists are trying to use the Organization of American States to achieve this goal, we declare our determination: to do everything we possibly can to support the heroic resistance of the Cuban people; at the same time, we also express our full and active solidarity with the peoples of Latin American countries still under the oppression of British, American, French, and Dutch colonialists; especially to unite with our brothers in Puerto Rico, the West Indies Federation, and British Guiana." The statement concluded, "We are also determined to do everything in our power to support the peoples of all countries who are fighting against the bloody dictatorships imposed on Dominica, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Paraguay by U.S. imperialism."

    马提尼克共产党举行代表大会
    大会制订了关于马提尼克争取国家自治的政策  二十四个国家的共产党和工人党向大会发贺电
    新华社巴黎8日电　据“人道报”报道，马提尼克共产党在7月30日和31日在马提尼克北部的莫恩鲁兹市举行了第二次代表大会。
    马提尼克岛是加勒比海法属西印度群岛的一部分（另一部分为瓜德罗普岛）。
    会上由尼古拉斯作了中央委员会的工作报告。大会制定了关于马提尼克争取国家自治的政策，并且指出当前帝国主义在世界各地正处于分崩离析的状态，法国的前附属国家相继获得独立，在拉丁美洲、在加勒比海、在委内瑞拉、在古巴，到处掀起了各被压迫国家的人民争取解放的风暴。
    马提尼克共产党把争取建成马提尼克岛的反殖民主义阵线、争取在安的列斯群岛—圭亚那联邦范围内实现马提尼克岛自治，作为自己的中心工作。
    在代表大会期间，有二十四个国家的共产党和工人党向大会发了贺电。
    马提尼克共产党8月1日在法兰西堡举行了一次盛大的集会，庆祝党的第二次代表大会胜利闭幕。法国、委内瑞拉和古巴的共产党的代表参加了这次集会，并在会上讲了话。大会自始至终都是在非常热烈的气氛中进行的。参加大会的群众热烈鼓掌欢呼党的争取马提尼克岛的自治的政治路线。大会在高唱国际歌声中结束。
    在马提尼克共产党第二次代表大会期间，古巴、瓜德罗普岛、马提尼克岛和委内瑞拉的共产党举行了会谈，并发表了联合声明。
    声明说，“安的列斯群岛和拉丁美洲地区的形势的特点是，各国人民争取使自己的国家摆脱帝国主义和殖民主义统治，争取自由、争取各国的经济和社会发展的斗争普遍高涨。当目前美帝国主义者公开威胁要进行干涉来扼杀古巴的人民革命和独立的时候；当美帝国主义者正要利用美洲国家组织来达到这个目的的时候，我们宣布我们的决心：要竭尽我们所可能采取的一切办法来支持古巴人民的英勇抵抗；同时我们也表示要和仍然处于英、美、法、荷殖民主义者压迫下的拉丁美洲各国人民完全地和积极地团结一致；特别是要同我们的波多黎各、西印度群岛联邦和英属圭亚那的兄弟们团结一致。”声明最后说，“我们也决心要竭尽全力支持同美帝国主义强加于多米尼加、海地、尼加拉瓜和巴拉圭的血腥独裁统治作斗争的各国人民。”
