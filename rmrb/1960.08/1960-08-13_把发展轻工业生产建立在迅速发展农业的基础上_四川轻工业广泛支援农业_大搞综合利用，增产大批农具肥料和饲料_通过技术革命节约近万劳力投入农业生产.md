Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 11th - Sichuan Province's light industry departments, based on the production characteristics of their industry, are doing everything possible to support agriculture, grasping both the present and the future, and basing the development of light industry production on the rapid development of agriculture.

Cadres in Sichuan's light industry departments recognize that the raw materials for light industry and the main market for light industrial products are in the countryside. Only with the great development of agricultural production and the continuous increase of agricultural income can more raw materials and a larger market be provided for light industry. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, they organized forces to go deep into the countryside, carefully investigate the needs of farmers' production and life, formulate long-term plans for their departments, and arrange production. While actively developing daily necessities, continuously improving quality, and increasing varieties, they also increased the production of production materials urgently needed by the countryside, adapting to local conditions. This year, in addition to producing more than five million pieces of various small agricultural tools and implements to support agriculture, the province's light industry departments, including sugar making, papermaking, textiles, and food industries, also made full use of the waste materials of their enterprises, vigorously engaged in comprehensive utilization, and produced large quantities of fertilizer and feed to supply the countryside. According to incomplete statistics, light industrial factories and enterprises in various places have produced more than one million tons of various fertilizers for communes since the beginning of this year.

Various local light industry departments, combined with the establishment of raw material bases, have also helped communes equip and develop commune-run industries, and improve the communes' own ability to carry out technological transformation. According to incomplete statistics, light industry departments in various places have so far assisted communes in building and expanding 4,600 factories (stations) for agricultural tools, agricultural fertilizers, and pesticides, 3,380 agricultural and sideline product processing plants, and 94 hydropower stations and power stations. This has laid a certain material foundation for the counties and communes contracted by the light industry to accelerate technological transformation and rapidly develop agricultural production, and has also created favorable conditions for the rapid development of light industry.

Sichuan's light industry departments, in light of the characteristics of their own business being closely related to agriculture, closely combine with the agricultural season to provide comprehensive technical support to agriculture from planting to harvesting. They cooperate with farmers to cultivate, select, summarize, and promote improved varieties of plants such as mulberry, cotton, sugarcane, and tobacco, work with farmers to cultivate high-yield experimental fields, carry out scientific and technological research, and help communes train technical personnel for processing agricultural and sideline products and experts in planting various economic crops. At present, light industry departments throughout the province have helped various communes train more than 10,000 various technical personnel. Industries such as cotton weaving, papermaking, and agricultural and sideline product processing have also organized nine advanced experience dissemination teams to go to various communes to impart technology. Silk factories in Mianyang and other places recently sent workers to silk production areas to participate in production, guide mulberry planting and silkworm rearing, and develop the province's silk industry. Light industry departments throughout the province have also extracted nearly ten thousand laborers to invest in agricultural production through technical innovation and technological revolution movements.

    四川轻工业广泛支援农业
    大搞综合利用，增产大批农具肥料和饲料　通过技术革命节约近万劳力投入农业生产
    新华社成都11日电　四川省轻工业部门根据本行业的生产特点，千方百计支援农业，既抓当前，又抓将来，把发展轻工业生产建立在迅速发展农业的基础上。
    四川轻工业部门的干部认识到轻工业原料和轻工业品的主要市场都在农村，只有农业生产大发展，农业收入不断增加，才能为轻工业提供更多的原料和更大的市场。因此，今年一开始就组织力量深入农村，认真调查农民生产、生活需要，制订本部门的长远规划，进行生产安排。在积极发展日用生活品、不断提高质量、增加花色品种的同时，还因地制宜地增产当前农村迫切需要的生产资料。全省轻工业部门今年除生产了各种小型农具和工具五百多万件支援农业以外，制糖、造纸、纺织、食品等行业，还充分利用本企业的废弃物资，大搞综合利用，生产了大批肥料和饲料供应农村。据不完全统计，各地轻工业工厂企业今年以来为公社生产了各种肥料一百多万吨。
    各地轻工业部门还结合建立原料基地，帮助公社装备和发展社办工业，提高公社本身进行技术改造的能力。据不完全统计，各地轻工业部门到目前为止共协助公社新建和扩建农具、农肥农药等厂（站）四千六百个，农副产品加工厂三千三百八十个，水电站、动力站九十四个。这样既为轻工业所包干的县社加快技术改造、迅速发展农业生产打下一定的物质基础，又为轻工业的迅速发展创造了有利条件。
    四川轻工业部门针对本身业务与农业关系十分密切的特点，紧密结合农事季节，从种到收以技术全面支援农业。他们配合农民培养、选择、总结、推广桑、棉、蔗、烟等植物的良种，和农民一道培植高产试验田，开展科学技术研究工作，帮助公社培养农副产品加工技术人员和种植多种经济作物的能手。目前，全省轻工业部门已帮助各公社培养出各种技术人员一万多人，棉织、造纸、农副产品加工等行业还组织了九个先进经验播种队，分赴各地公社传授技术。绵阳等地丝厂最近抽出工人到蚕桑产区参加生产，指导种桑养蚕，发展全省蚕桑事业。全省轻工业部门还通过技术革新和技术革命运动，先后抽出将近一万个劳动力投入农业生产。
