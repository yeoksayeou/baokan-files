The Chengdu Measuring and Cutting Tool Factory's employees have firmly established the idea of "taking agriculture as the foundation," making support for agriculture a conscious mass movement. The employees have incorporated plans to support the Qinglong Commune in the suburbs into their group and individual production plans and competition conditions, closely integrating support for agriculture with production within the factory, promoting each other.

The majority of workers at the Chengdu Measuring and Cutting Tool Factory come from rural areas and have close ties with farmers. This year, through studying "taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy," the sense of responsibility of the broad masses of workers to support agriculture has been greatly stimulated. Whenever they visit rural areas and see the heavy physical labor of their farmer brothers, they cannot help but want to change this situation for them. An old worker in the fixture workshop, when visiting the commune, automatically helped the farmers install ball bearings on a manure cart, immediately increasing efficiency threefold. Afterwards, he said to his comrades in the group, "Look, we have the technology and equipment, and with a little effort, we can solve big problems for our farmer brothers." Whenever the group's production and support tasks were heavy, he often encouraged his comrades in the group, saying, "Let's work harder! We workers cannot only focus on completing production tasks; if we don't support agriculture, not to mention anything else, we won't even be able to solve the problem of eating!" He himself would go to the Qinglong Commune whenever he had time to help the commune members repair and改造 farm tools.

In the Chengdu Measuring and Cutting Tool Factory, the idea of everyone doing a few good things for the commune has taken deep root in people's hearts. People can often see groups of workers working overtime on their off-hours and holidays to rush-produce farm tools and various simple equipment for the commune. People can also often encounter groups of workers "visiting relatives" in the Qinglong Commune, eagerly asking what is lacking and what needs to be repaired. Once, the workers of the No. 1 Measurement Group went to the commune to "visit relatives," and the commune Party secretary brought them boiled water. The workers asked and learned that the water had to be carried from the stream at the bottom of the slope. Back at the factory, they immediately rushed to make a water pump for the commune overnight and delivered it to the commune three days later.

In March of this year, the factory undertook a batch of rice transplanter manufacturing tasks. The employees scrambled to sign up and conducted a crash program during their spare time. In the month or so after the factory was linked with the commune, the employees used waste materials and scraps to manufacture and repair more than 1,500 pieces of equipment, parts, and tools for the commune.

In order to make this mass movement develop sustainably, the factory divided all units of the factory into eight cooperation zones, according to the eight management areas of the commune. It was stipulated that the factory would be responsible for the construction and equipment of factories in the commune, each branch factory would be responsible for establishing repair stations in the management areas, and each group would be responsible for repairing and manufacturing farm tools and tools for the production teams. After implementing layer-by-layer responsibility and paired assistance in this way, the mass movement to support agriculture further developed in an organized and planned manner, thereby promoting a deeper and wider development of this mass movement. In particular, the group-based support for production teams played a significant role in fully mobilizing the enthusiasm and consciousness of the masses of employees in supporting agriculture. Once, the circular saw of the commune's farm tool factory broke down and needed repair. After receiving a verbal notice, the workers of the model group in the sand casting workshop immediately rushed there after work, not only helping to repair the circular saw, but also改造 three grinding machines. Now, a close relationship has been generally formed between the factory's production groups and the commune's production teams, with people going whenever called, arriving whenever there is a problem, and helping to solve problems immediately. This method solves the combination of temporary repairs and key support from factory workshops, so that the work of supporting agriculture can be done more deeply, meticulously, and promptly.

In order to regularize the activities of supporting agriculture, the factory Party committee also mobilized workers to discuss and formulate plans to support agriculture when discussing monthly production plans, incorporate them into competition conditions, and conduct monthly inspections and evaluations. This closely integrated the activities of supporting agriculture with its own production, promoting and encouraging each other. For example, in June, the worker Shui Chengjin of the No. 2 Fixture Group was making iron parts for threshing machines, and his own production tasks were already very tight. According to his usual progress, it would be difficult to complete the task by the end of the month. However, when he thought of the great significance of threshing machines for supporting the autumn harvest in agriculture, he immediately became a hundred times more courageous and used his brain to improve a machine tool, increasing the efficiency of turning by three times, completing the monthly production task ahead of schedule, and squeezing out time to rush-produce threshing machines. The employees have a high degree of consciousness in supporting agricultural production, as well as good systems and methods. Therefore, everyone not only successfully completed the task of supporting agricultural technical改造, but also successfully completed the national production plan. In the past six months, they have helped the commune establish and equip farm tool factories, fertilizer factories, pesticide factories, brick and tile factories, farm tool repair stations, substations, and pumping stations; at the same time, they have also helped carry out mass tool reform movements,修造 thousands of tools.

    树立以农业为基础思想　建立层层负责对口包干制度
    成都量具刃具厂支援农业形成自觉的群众运动
    本报讯　成都量具刃具厂职工坚定地树立了“以农业为基础”的思想，使支援农业成为自觉性的群众运动。职工们都把支援市郊青龙公社的计划纳入小组、个人的生产规划和竞赛条件，使支援农业和厂内生产密切结合，互相促进。
    成都量具刃具厂的工人，绝大部分来自农村，和农民有着血肉关系。今年，通过“国民经济以农业为基础”的学习，大大激发了广大职工支援农业的责任感。每当他们参观访问农村，看到农民兄弟那种繁重的体力劳动，总情不自禁地想替他们改变这种状况。卡具车间有个老工人在参观公社时，就自动帮助农民在粪车上安装了滚珠轴承，工效立即提高三倍。事后他就向小组里的同志说：“你看，我们有技术，有设备，一举手就替农民弟兄解决了大问题。”每当小组生产和支援任务繁重的时候，他就常鼓励小组的同志说：“加油干吧！我们工人不能只顾完成生产任务；不支援农业，不说别的，单是吃饭问题都不能解决啊！”他自己更是一有空就到青龙公社去帮助社员修理和改造农具。
    在成都量具刃具厂里，人人为公社办几件好事的思想已经深入人心。人们经常可以看到在业余时间和假日，一群群的工人熬更守夜为公社赶制农具和各种简易设备。人们也可以经常在青龙公社遇到一群群“走亲戚”的工人，殷切地询问缺什么，要修理什么。有一次，量具一组的工人到公社去“走亲戚”，公社党委书记给他们端来了开水。工人们一问，知道水要从坡下溪沟里挑来，回到厂里马上连夜为公社赶制一部抽水机，三天后送到了公社。
    今年3月，厂里承担了一批插秧机的制造任务。职工们争相报名，利用业余时间进行突击。在工厂与公社挂钩后的一个多月中，职工们就利用废旧料和边角余料为公社制造和修理了设备、零件和工具等达一千五百多件。
    为了使这个群众运动能持久地发展下去，厂里按照公社八个管理区，把全厂各单位搭配成八个协作区。规定工厂包干公社修建和装备工厂，各分厂包干管理区建立修配站，各小组包干生产队修造农具和工具。这样实行层层负责、对口包干后，使支援农业的群众运动进一步发展到有组织有计划的地步，从而促进了这个群众运动更深入更广泛地开展。特别是小组包干支援生产队，对充分发挥职工群众支援农业的积极性和自觉性起了很大作用。有一次，公社农具厂的圆盘锯坏了需要修理，和它对口包干的翻砂车间模型组的工人接到口头通知后，一下班立即赶去，不仅帮助修好了圆盘锯，还改装了三台砂轮机。现在工厂生产小组和公社生产队之间已普遍形成一喊就去，有事即到，有问题马上帮助解决的亲密关系。这种方式，解决了临时性的修配和工厂车间的重点支援相结合的问题，从而使支援农业的工作能做得更深入细致和及时。
    为了使支援农业的活动经常化，厂党委并发动工人在讨论每月的生产计划时，也讨论和制订支援农业的计划，纳入竞赛条件，按月检查评比。这就使支援农业的活动与本身的生产紧密结合起来，互相推动，互相促进。例如，6月份卡具二组的工人税成金，在车制打谷机的铁件时，本身的生产任务已很紧，按照平日的进度，到月底很难完成任务，但是当他一想到打谷机对支援农业秋收的巨大意义时，立即勇气百倍，开动脑筋改进了一个台具，使车削工效提高三倍，提前完成了全月的生产任务，挤出时间赶制打谷机。职工们对支援农业生产有高度的自觉，又有很好的制度和办法，所以，大家既出色地完成支援农业技术改造任务，也出色地完成了国家生产计划。半年多来，他们帮助公社建立和装备了农具厂、化肥厂、农药厂、砖瓦厂、农具修配站、变电所和抽水站；同时又帮助开展群众性的工具改革运动，修造了几千件工具。（附图片）
