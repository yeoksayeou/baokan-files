Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 24th: Cuban Prime Minister Castro said at a rally last night that some people at the Organization of American States meeting were attempting to encircle Cuba and justify aggression against Cuba, but "whether there is an Organization of American States or not, we will surely be victorious; whether there is an Organization of American States or not, the (Cuban) revolution is a fact that cannot be erased from this continent." He said, "Even millions of Herters cannot suppress the truth."

Castro vehemently condemned U.S. imperialism as the enemy of humanity. He said that the whole world is now opposing U.S. imperialism. "We are standing in the front-line trenches of this great struggle against insatiable and exploitative imperialism, against bloodthirsty and greedy imperialism. This enemy of humanity is trying to occupy this trench, but they will never be able to take it." Castro said, "Our government is the most stable government on the American continent because it is the only government with armed workers and peasants."

Castro was speaking at a mass rally held to celebrate the founding of the Cuban Women's Federation. The crowd responded to his speech with enthusiastic cheers. When he mentioned the Organization of American States and U.S. Secretary of State Herter in his speech, the audience booed and mocked.

Castro said to the United States, "We no longer believe in your hypocritical democracy, the murderers who kill black people... We no longer believe in your hypocritical freedom, the planters of tyrants on our continent;... We no longer believe in your hypocritical words about justice, because you exploit Bolivian, Indian, Chilean workers, Venezuelan oil workers, and you seize oil concessions in Argentina." "We no longer believe in your hypocritical Pan-American spirit, which you want to use to cover up a system of oppression and abuse, a hateful system that you impose on the divided peoples of our America."

Castro said that we are no longer submissive people, we have learned to say "no." He said, "We are friends of those who are willing to be our friends. Cuba in the United Nations will never again be a country that votes according to your (the United States') instructions, but according to the instructions of our dignity and our sovereignty. We will friends of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, because they have shown that they are our friends while your aggress against us and attempt to destroy us."

    卡斯特罗在庆祝古巴妇联成立大会上说
    古巴人民站在反帝斗争的第一线
    美帝国主义是人类的敌人  古巴人民的反侵略斗争必将胜利
    新华社哈瓦那24日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗昨晚在一次集会上说，在美洲国家组织的会议上有人企图包围古巴和为对古巴进行侵略辩解，但是，“不管有没有美洲国家组织，我们必将得到胜利；不管有没有美洲国家组织，（古巴）革命是不能从本大陆抹煞的事实”。他说，“就是有几百万个赫脱也决不能够压制真理”。
    卡斯特罗痛斥美帝国主义是人类的敌人。他说，现在全世界都在反对美帝国主义。“我们是站在这个反对贪得无餍和剥削成性的帝国主义，反对嗜血而贪婪的帝国主义的伟大斗争的第一线战壕。这个人类的敌人企图占领这个战壕，然而他们决不能够攻下它”。卡斯特罗说，“我们的政府是美洲大陆上最稳固的政府，因为它是唯一有武装的工人和农民的政府。”
    卡斯特罗是在为成立古巴妇女联合会而举行的群众大会上讲话的。到会的群众对他的讲话报以热烈的欢呼。当他在讲话时提到美洲国家组织和美国国务卿赫脱的时候，会场就发出嘘声和嘲笑。
    卡斯特罗针对美国说，“我们不再相信你们虚伪的民主制度，杀害黑人的凶手……我们不再相信你们虚伪的自由，我们大陆上暴君的播植者；……我们不再相信你们关于正义的伪善言词，因为你们剥削玻利维亚、印第安、智利工人、委内瑞拉石油工人，你们在阿根廷攫取石油租借地。”“我们不再相信你们的假仁假义的泛美精神，你们想用这种所谓泛美精神来掩盖一种压迫和胡作非为的制度，一种你们强加在我们美洲被分离的各国人民头上的可恶制度。”
    卡斯特罗说，我们已经不再是唯唯诺诺的人了，我们已经学会了说“不”。他说，“我们是那些愿意成为我们的朋友的人的朋友。古巴在联合国里永远不再是根据你们（美国）的指示来投票的国家了，而是根据我们的尊严和我们的主权的指示来进行投票。我们将是苏联和中华人民共和国的朋友，因为他们已经表明他们是我们的朋友，而你们却侵略我们并企图摧毁我们。”
