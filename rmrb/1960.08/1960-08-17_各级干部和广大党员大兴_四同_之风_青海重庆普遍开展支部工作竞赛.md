    Cadres at All Levels and the Broad Masses of Party Members Vigorously Promote the Style of "Four Togethernesses"
    Qinghai and Chongqing Universally Carry Out Branch Work Competitions
    (By Our Own Correspondent) Since the beginning of this year, Party organizations at all levels in Qinghai Province have closely integrated with the central tasks of each period and universally carried out appraisal and competition movements between branches and Party members. Now, more than 500 model Party branches and a large number of model Party members, who are good at putting politics in command, good at leading the masses in production, good at caring for the lives of the masses, and good at their work style, have emerged throughout the province. As a result of the appraisal and competition, Party organizations and Party members at all levels have further played their role as fighting fortresses and exemplary vanguards, thereby ensuring the victorious completion of various central tasks and promoting the further consolidation and development of the people's communes.
    Since Party organizations at all levels regard leadership style and work methods as the main content of the appraisal and competition, the broad masses of Party members and cadres have gone to the forefront, eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses, and effectively leading and promoting overall production leaps forward while participating in production. Many Party branches have adopted the method of branch committee members being responsible for teams and Party members being responsible for groups, going deep into production to participate in labor, discover problems, and solve problems. The branch committee members of the Li Family Production Team Party Branch, a model branch of the Manping Commune in Minhe, were each responsible for a work team during the land reclamation campaign, going deep to participate in land reclamation and lead land reclamation. Branch committee member (production team leader) Li Cunshan, in addition to taking care of the entire team's work, reclaimed five to seven fen of land every day; Party member and work team leader Zhu Yongfu reclaimed up to two and a half mu of land every day. The exemplary actions of the branch committee members and Party members greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the commune members for land reclamation, enabling them to complete the ten-day land reclamation task in five days. As a result, this branch won the red flag of excellence in the evaluation of all branches in the commune for thirteen consecutive times. In the fourteenth evaluation, because there were still third-class seedlings in the team, which caused them to not get the red flag, the Party branch decided to catch up. It mobilized from within the Party to outside the Party, further arousing the enthusiasm of the Party members and the masses to actively participate in weeding, topdressing, and other shock movements, quickly upgrading all the original third-class seedlings, with first-class seedlings reaching over 85%.
    In carrying out the competition, Party organizations at all levels, on the basis of fully mobilizing Party members and the masses, promptly put forward clear and specific evaluation contents, formulated evaluation systems, and adopted various forms to summarize and promote experience in a timely manner, so as to deepen and persist in the movement. The Organization Department of the Huangyuan County Party Committee once put forward "ten good" evaluation conditions to Party branches and Party members throughout the county, including improving work style and work methods. In addition, Party organizations in many places often organized visits, held on-site meetings, and conferences of advanced branches and model Party member representatives to commend advanced individuals and summarize and promote experiences in a timely manner. In April, the Haiyan County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an on-site meeting in the Party branch of the County Grain Bureau with the participation of the county party secretary, commune party committee secretaries, branch secretaries, and branch committee members, a total of thirty-six people, to introduce the working experience of the branch. Due to the attention and leadership of Party organizations in various places and the adoption of effective measures, a new situation quickly emerged within the Party: "Everyone learns from the advanced, everyone strives to be upstream," "Learning has content, comparison has objects, catching up has goals, surpassing has direction, and helping has priorities," making the evaluation and competition movement deepen and persist wave after wave.
    (By Our Own Correspondent) More than 5,000 Party branches in Chongqing launched a competition movement to be "the same" as red flag branches, making the city's Party branch work appear with a vigorous scene of "one horse takes the lead and ten thousand horses leap, one flag is held high and ten thousand flags fly."
    In order to promote the "same" competition movement, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first established eighty-five red flag branches in the city's industrial, transportation, construction, financial and trade systems as "the same" model for Party branches throughout the city. These red flag branches not only completed tasks very well in leading the sustained high yield and technological revolution movement, but also have significant characteristics in leadership art, political and ideological work, and in giving play to the role of Party groups and Party members. After these red flag branches were established, branches in various industries not only had specific content to compare, learn, catch up, and help, but also formulated specific conditions and measures to catch up with the "same" red flag branches according to the various stages of production and central tasks, and conducted regular inspections and evaluations. The Party Committee of the Refractory Materials Factory of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company resolutely implemented the resolutions of the higher Party Committee, grasped various tasks firmly, tightly, and to the end; political and ideological work was implemented to Party members, and Party members not only took the lead in production and central tasks, but also comprehensively cared for the thoughts, production, and lives of the masses; the leadership style of the Party Committee leading cadres was in-depth, and in the technical revolution movement, the Party Committee and leading cadres at all levels set an example in everything, personally participated in the most difficult work, and worked and consulted with the masses. As a result, the enthusiasm of the workers was high, and the task completion was excellent. The entire factory has been a national red flag for two years. After the Party Committee of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company established this Party Committee as a "the same" model for the branches of the entire company, each Party Committee and branch formulated specific conditions and measures to catch up with the Party Committee of the Refractory Materials Factory, setting off a competition upsurge of "learning from the Party Committee of the Refractory Materials Factory and catching up with the Party Committee of the Refractory Materials Factory." Soon, fifty-two units throughout the company reached the "same" level as the Party Committee of the Refractory Materials Factory.
    Another characteristic of the "same" competition movement carried out by branches throughout the city is that the competition movement has developed from a confrontation competition between one factory and one place to a joint large-scale competition composed of Party branches from various industries and regions as a whole. In terms of municipal industries, the city is divided into nine systems according to heavy industry, coal, electricity, machinery, etc., and each system is further divided into thirty-six professional "same" large-scale collaborative competitions according to different types of work. The city's seven districts have also divided them into 117 competition collaboration zones or collaboration areas based on the district's machinery, light industry, finance and trade, schools, and other different production systems and industries, or by region. In the competition, each Party branch not only strives to make its own branch "a factory red" and "a point red," but also strives to cooperate and support each other in political and ideological work, production technology, human resources and materials, striving for a "system red" in its own system and a "piece red" in its own collaboration area. In the branch competition in the light industry system of the Shizhong District, thanks to the great collaboration of the branches in each collaboration area, the branch work in nine of the ten collaboration areas in the district's industrial sector basically achieved "a piece red."
    After the "same" competition movement of the Party branch work was carried out, the advanced ideology and work style of advanced branches and Party members were widely disseminated and promoted, and advanced experience was widely popularized and improved, which rapidly improved the leadership level of the branches and greatly enlivened the life of the Party. The leaders of the Automotive Repair Factory Branch in Shapingba District were originally busy with administrative affairs, the work was generally called upon, and the role of Party members was not fully utilized, and the production tasks had not been completed well. After learning from the experience of the Zhongnan Rubber Factory and other branches in fully playing the role of the branch's fighting fortress in the "same" movement, they learned to give full play to the role of the Party organization in leading production and handed over political and ideological work to all Party members, forming a political and ideological work network in the entire factory. All the branch committee members were fully assigned to the workshop to work on the spot, which greatly strengthened the leadership of production. Since the second quarter, the production tasks have been overfulfilled every month. On the basis of completing the production tasks for the first half of the year 50 days ahead of schedule, the production tasks for June were completed 11 days ahead of schedule. This branch has become a red flag branch in the entire district. (Attached picture)

    各级干部和广大党员大兴“四同”之风
    青海重庆普遍开展支部工作竞赛
    本报讯　青海省各级党组织今年以来，紧密结合各个时期的中心任务，普遍开展了支部、党员之间的评比竞赛运动。现在，全省已经涌现出五百多个政治挂帅好、领导群众生产好、关心群众生活好、工作作风好的模范党支部和大批模范党员。由于通过评比竞赛，各级党组织和党员进一步发挥了战斗堡垒作用和模范带头作用，从而保证了各项中心任务的胜利完成，促进了人民公社的进一步巩固和发展。
    由于各级党组织都把领导作风、工作方法作为评比竞赛的主要内容，广大党员干部纷纷深入第一线，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，在参加生产中有效地领导生产、推动生产全面跃进。许多党支部采取支委包队、党员包组的办法，深入到生产中，一面劳动，一面发现问题，解决问题。民和满坪公社的标兵支部李家生产队党支部的支部委员，在开荒运动中都包干一个作业队，深入下去，参加开荒，领导开荒。支部委员（生产队长）李存山除照顾全队工作外，每天都开荒五至七分；党员作业队长朱永富每天开荒达两亩半。支委和党员的模范行动大大鼓舞了社员群众的开荒热情，使十天的开荒任务，五天就完成了。因而这个支部在全社各支部评比中，连续十三次获得优胜红旗。在第十四次评比时，由于这个队还存在三类苗没评得红旗，党支部决心赶上去，便从党内到党外，深入进行了动员，使党员和群众进一步鼓足了干劲，积极投入除草、追肥等突击运动，很快就使原有的三类苗全部升级，一类苗达85％以上。
    在开展竞赛中，各级党组织都在充分发动党员群众的基础上，及时提出明确具体的评比内容，制定评比制度，并采取多种形式，及时总结、推广经验，使运动深入持久地开展。湟源县委组织部曾向全县党支部和党员提出了包括改进工作作风、工作方法等“十好”评比条件。此外，许多地方的党组织还经常组织参观、召开现场会议、先进支部和模范党员代表会议，及时表彰先进，总结、推广经验。中共海晏县委4月间在县粮食局党支部曾经召开了有县委书记、公社党委书记、支部书记、支部委员三十六人参加的现场会议，介绍该支部的工作经验。由于各地党组织的重视领导，采取有效措施，所以在党内很快就出现了一个“人人学先进、个个争上游”，“学有内容、比有对象、赶有目标、超有方向、帮有重点”的新局面，使评比竞赛运动一浪高一浪地深入持久地开展起来。
    本报讯　重庆五千多个党支部开展与红旗支部“一个样”的竞赛运动，使全市党的支部工作出现了一个“一马当先万马跃，一旗高举万旗飘”的蓬勃景象。
    中共重庆市委为了推动“一个样”竞赛运动，首先在全市的工业、交通、基建、财贸等系统树立了八十五个红旗支部，作为全市党支部的“一个样”标兵。这些红旗支部不仅在领导持续高产、技术革命运动中完成任务很出色，而且在领导艺术、政治思想工作、发挥党小组和党员的作用等等方面，都有显著的特点。这些红旗支部树立以后，各行各业的支部不仅有了比、学、赶、帮的具体内容，而且按生产和中心任务的各个阶段，订出了赶上“一个样”红旗支部的具体条件和措施，进行经常性的检查、评比。重庆钢铁公司的耐火材料厂党委，贯彻上级党委决议坚决，各项工作抓得狠、抓得紧、抓到底；政治思想工作落实到党员，党员不仅在生产和中心任务中积极带头，而且还全面关心群众思想、生产、生活；党委领导干部作风深入，在技术革命运动中，党委和各级领导干部处处以身作则，亲自参加最困难的工作，与群众同劳动、同商量。因而职工生产热情高涨，完成任务出色，全厂两年来都是全国红旗。重庆钢铁公司党委树立起这个党委为全公司支部“一个样”的标兵后，各个党委和支部都订了赶上耐火材料厂的具体条件和措施，掀起了“学耐火材料厂党委、赶耐火材料厂党委”的竞赛热潮。全公司很快就有五十二个单位达到了耐火材料厂党委“一个样”的水平。
    全市支部开展“一个样”竞赛中的另一特色，是竞赛运动已经由一厂、一地之间的对手赛，发展成为各行业、各地区之间，由各单位党支部组成一体的联合大竞赛。在市属工业方面，全市按重工、煤炭、电力、机械等九个系统，各系统又按不同工种组成了三十六个专业的“一个样”大协作竞赛。全市七个区又根据区属的机械、轻工、财贸、学校等不同生产系统和行业，或按地区划成了一百一十七个竞赛协作区或协作片。在竞赛中各个党支部不仅要力争本支部“一厂红”、“一点红”，而且更要在政治思想工作，生产技术，人力物力上互相协作、支援，力争本系统、本专业的“系统红”和本协作片的“一片红”。市中区的轻工业系统开展支部竞赛中，由于各个协作片的支部，开展了大协作，全区工业方面的十个协作片中就有九个片的支部工作基本上实现了“一片红”。
    党的支部工作“一个样”竞赛运动开展后，先进支部和党员的先进思想作风得到大传播，大发扬，先进经验大普及，大提高，迅速提高了支部的领导水平，大大活跃了党的生活。沙坪坝区的汽车修配厂支部领导，原来忙于行政事务，工作一般号召，党员的作用没有充分发挥，生产任务一直完成不好。“一个样”运动中，学习了中南橡胶厂等支部充分发挥支部战斗堡垒作用的经验后，学会了在领导生产中充分发挥党组织作用，把政治思想工作交给全体党员，在全厂形成了政治思想工作网。支部委员都全部分工包干到车间现场办公，大大加强了对生产的领导。二季度以来，月月超额完成生产任务，在提前五十一天完成上半年生产任务的基础上，又提前十一天完成6月份的生产任务。这个支部已成为全区的红旗支部。（附图片）
