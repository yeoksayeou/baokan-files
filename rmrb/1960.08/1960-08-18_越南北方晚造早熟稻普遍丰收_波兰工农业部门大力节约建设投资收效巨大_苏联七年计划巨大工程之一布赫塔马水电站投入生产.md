    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 15th: Many provinces in northern Vietnam have begun harvesting their early-maturing late rice crops, and good news is pouring in. This year's early-maturing rice will generally be a bumper harvest.
    In the provinces of Cao Bang, Lang Son, Bac Ninh, and Nghe An, the yield per hectare of early-maturing rice generally exceeded that of previous years. For example, Cao Bang Province achieved an average yield of 2,650 kilograms per hectare. The total output of early-maturing rice in the province increased by 9.84% compared to the bumper harvest of 1959. Some areas in Cao Bang Province achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of early-maturing rice, such as Phong Nam Commune in Chongqing County, where the average yield reached 3,500 kilograms per hectare. The average yield of early-maturing rice in Lang Son Province also reached over 2,300 kilograms per hectare, an increase of 50 kilograms compared to the average yield last year.
    Although the early rice in northern Vietnam suffered reduced yields this year due to severe natural disasters not seen in many years, farmers everywhere responded to the call of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government to "make up for losses with abundance" and strive for a bumper harvest of late rice. Under the leadership of the Party, they launched a large-scale production campaign to seize a bumper harvest of late rice and initiated labor competitions. In addition to striving to ensure the planting area for regular late rice and miscellaneous grains, farmers in various regions also tried every means to expand the area under double-cropping. According to statistics, as of August 1st, more than 60,000 hectares of early-maturing rice had been planted, an increase of about 35% compared to the planting area of early-maturing rice in 1959.

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 15th: Poland is actively implementing the resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party on investment tasks for 1961-1965, and is utilizing construction investment more rationally and effectively.
    Since the Fifth Plenary Session, provincial and county committees have held plenary sessions as well as meetings of economic and agricultural cadres to discuss implementing the resolution, revising investment plans, and tapping production potential. Many provinces have also established investment revision committees and investment revision working groups, as well as expert working groups, to specifically lead this work. The resolution of the plenary session is also being thoroughly implemented in industrial and mining enterprises across the country and is yielding results.
    Recently, several large factories in Opole Province revised their investment plans, thereby saving the state more than 500 million zlotys (Polish currency) in funds. Several new construction projects in the province will also save the state more than 60 million zlotys due to reduced construction costs.
    After discussing the full utilization of production potential to reduce investment and increase production, the workers of the Małapanew Steelworks in Ozimek have so far put forward 178 rationalization proposals. The steelworks originally planned to build two new electric furnaces between 1961 and 1965, but after discussion by the workers, it has now been decided to build only one electric furnace while ensuring production tasks. In addition, the workers have also decided to save the state more than 75 million zlotys through technological reforms and other methods.
    In the discussion, the workers of the Cegielski Machine Factory in Poznań Province decided to replace the plan to build a new lathe factory with a plan to utilize existing equipment and establish new workshops in the factory. This will save the state 100 million zlotys in funds.
    The new aluminum smelting plant to be built in Konin is one of the largest investment projects in the next five-year plan. Recently, improvements in the design of the four major electrolysis workshops by engineers and architects will reduce the construction cost of the project by 45% compared to the original plan, and save 40% of the steel.
    After discussion, economists from the Ministry of Agriculture believe that the national water conservancy work during the next five-year plan can save 2 billion zlotys without affecting the tasks.

    Xinhua News Agency, August 16th: According to TASS from Kamenogorsk, the Bukhtarma Hydropower Station, a large hydropower station on the Irtysh River in the Soviet Union, began production on the 14th. The first batch of electricity produced by its first hydraulic turbine has been continuously transmitted to the Altai mining area, the main non-ferrous metal base in the eastern region of the Soviet Union.
    The Bukhtarma Hydropower Station is one of the huge hydropower stations stipulated in the Soviet Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) to be fully completed. Its total power generation capacity is 675,000 kilowatts, and it can generate 2.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. The dam, one hundred meters high, cuts off the rapid current of the Irtysh River, forming one of the world's largest artificial reservoirs in the Altai Mountains - the "Bukhtarma Artificial Sea." Its area is 5,500 square kilometers, and its storage capacity is 53 billion cubic meters. This enables the Bukhtarma Hydropower Station to operate at full capacity at any time of the year, regardless of changes in the Irtysh River's water volume.
    The Irtysh River originates in China and is more than 4,420 kilometers long. It flows through the Kazakh Republic of the Soviet Union and joins the Ob River in Western Siberia. According to the plan for comprehensive utilization of the hydropower resources of the Irtysh River, the Soviet Union will build a total of 16 cascade hydropower stations on it. The Bukhtarma Hydropower Station is the first "cascade" (its second "cascade" - the Kamenogorsk Hydropower Station - began generating electricity eight years ago). The commissioning of the Bukhtarma Hydropower Station will ensure the further development of the electric metallurgy industry and other electricity-intensive industrial sectors in the eastern region of the Kazakh Republic.

    新华社河内15日电　越南北方许多省份的晚造早熟稻已经开始收割，喜报频频传来，今年的早熟稻将普遍丰收。
    在高平、凉山、北宁、义安各省，早熟稻的每公顷单位面积产量一般都超过了往年。如高平省每公顷平均产量达到二千六百五十公斤。全省早熟稻总产量比丰收的1959年增长9.84％。高平省有些地方的早熟稻获得了空前大丰收，如重庆县丰南乡每公顷平均产量达到三千五百公斤。谅山省的早熟稻每公顷平均产量也达到二千三百公斤以上，比去年的平均产量增加五十公斤。
    虽然今年越南北方的早稻，由于遭到多年未遇的严重自然灾害而欠收。但各地农民响应越南劳动党和政府提出的“以丰补欠”、力争晚造大丰收的号召，在党的领导下发动了声势浩大的夺取晚稻大丰收的生产战役，展开了劳动竞赛。各地农民除努力保证晚稻正造和杂粮的种植面积外，还千方百计地扩大复种面积。据统计，到8月1日为止，各地已种植了六万多公顷早熟稻，比1959年早熟稻的种植面积扩大约三成半。
    新华社华沙15日电　波兰各地正在积极贯彻波兰统一工人党第五次中央全会关于1961—1965年的投资任务问题的决议，更加合理和有效地利用建设投资。
    自五中全会以后，各省委、县委都召开了全体会议以及经济干部和农业干部会议，讨论贯彻五中全会决议、修改投资计划、挖掘生产潜力等问题。许多省还成立了修改投资委员会和修改投资工作组以及专家工作组等，来具体领导这一工作。全会的决议也正在各地工矿企业中深入贯彻，并收到效果。
    最近，奥波累省的几个大工厂都修改了投资计划，从而为国家节约五亿多兹罗提（波币）的资金。这个省的几个新的工程项目由于降低了建设成本，也将为国家节约六千多万兹罗提。
    奥津克地方的马拉帕内夫冶金工厂的职工们经过对充分利用生产潜力，以减少投资和提高生产问题的讨论以后，到目前为止已经提出了一百七十八条合理化建议。这个冶金工厂原计划在1961—1965年间增建两座电炉，但是经过职工的讨论后，现在决定在保证生产任务的情况下只建设一座电炉。另外职工们还决定通过技术改革等办法为国家节约七千五百多万兹罗提。
    波兹南省的策格耳斯基机器制造厂的职工在讨论中决定，要通过利用现有的设备和工厂中建立新车间的办法，来代替再建立一个新车床工厂的计划。这样将为国家节约一亿兹罗提的资金。
    在科宁地方要建设的新的炼铝工厂是下一个五年计划中最大的投资项目之一。最近由于工程师和建筑家们改进了建设四大电解车间的设计，将可以使工程的建设成本比原计划减少45％，可节约40％的钢材。
    农业部的经济学家们经过讨论后，认为在下一个五年计划期间全国水利化的工作在不影响任务的基础上，可以节省二十亿兹罗提。
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社石山口讯：苏联额尔齐斯河上的大型水电站——布赫塔马水电站，已经在14日开始投入生产。它的第一台水力联动机所生产的头一批电力，已源源输往苏联东部地区的主要有色金属基地阿尔泰矿山。
    布赫塔马水电站是苏联七年计划（1959—1965年）规定要全部建成的巨大水电站之一，它的总发电能力为六十七万五千瓩，每年可以发电二十五亿度。这个水电站高一百米的大堤坝拦腰截断了额尔齐斯河的急流，而在阿尔泰群山中形成了世界上最大的人造水库之一——
  “布赫塔马人造海”。它的面积为五千五百平方公里，蓄水量为五百三十亿立方米。这使得布赫塔马水电站的全部发电能力在全年任何时候都能全部工作，而不受额尔齐斯河水量变化的影响。
    额尔齐斯河发源于中国，全长四千四百二十多公里。它流经苏联的哈萨克共和国，而在西西伯利亚同鄂毕河会合。根据综合利用额尔齐斯河水力资源的计划，苏联总共将在它上面建设十六个梯级水电站，布赫塔马水电站就是其中的第一“梯级”（它的第二“梯级”——石山口水电站在八年前已开始发电）。布赫塔马水电站的投入生产，将保证哈萨克共和国东部地区电力冶金工业和其他费电工业部门的进一步发展。
