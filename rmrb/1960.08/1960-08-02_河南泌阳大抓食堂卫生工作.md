Mìyáng County, Henan Province, Intensifies Efforts on Dining Hall Hygiene

(Reported by this newspaper) Mìyáng County, Henan Province, closely integrating with autumn production, is vigorously carrying out a fly-free dining hall campaign. Since June 28th, the county has been carrying out continuous concentrated efforts. Currently, the fly density has generally decreased, the sanitation situation has been completely renewed, and a number of dining halls that have basically reached a fly-free level have emerged.

Since the summer, with the development of the sanitary fertilizer accumulation campaign, the vast majority of dining halls in the county have carried out "seven improvements" and "three treatments," effectively preventing the occurrence of various summer epidemics. However, since June, due to the masses being busy with fighting drought and rush planting, the sanitation work in the dining halls has been relaxed, and mosquitoes and flies have begun to breed again, especially the density of flies has significantly increased. In order to eliminate flies in a timely manner, the Mìyáng County Party Committee held a telephone conference of the Party Committee secretaries of various communes at the end of June, issuing instructions on eliminating pests and diseases, requiring the secretaries of the commune and brigade Party committees to personally take charge, and mobilizing the masses to vigorously carry out the fly-free dining hall campaign. The county party committee also put forward specific requirements for dining halls to have "four haves" (namely, have a health worker, have flycatchers, food has gauze covers, and cooks have aprons), "three cleans" (food clean, cooking utensils clean, and kitchen clean), and "three no's" (no moldy food, no accumulated sewage, and no flies).

In order to strengthen leadership, the county, communes, and brigades have all designated a Party Committee member to be responsible for command. The county and communes have established "Pest and Disease Elimination Command Headquarters," and the large brigades have established health leading groups, with each level responsible and strengthening leadership to carry things through to the end. On the basis of fully mobilizing the masses, various localities have used methods such as catching, smoking, poisoning, luring, digging (maggots and pupae), and harmless treatment of粪便, clearing garbage, and filling in dead pits, and launched a mass fly-killing campaign. The 赊湾 Commune Party Committee extracted three Party Committee members to command in sections, organizing cadres and medical personnel of eighty-seven people to universally supervise and inspect, and promote the brigades to use pre-meal and post-meal time to carry out a food moving, utensil washing, and kitchen cleaning campaign. In the 马谷田 Commune, out of three hundred and ninety-three dining halls, forty-seven had unsound sanitation systems in the past. Through this sanitation campaign, they generally implemented systems such as isolation of sick people, special care, food identification, frequent cleaning of cooking utensils, and regular inspections and evaluations, so that twenty-four of the original forty-one third-class dining halls in the commune were upgraded.

    河南泌阳大抓食堂卫生工作
    本报讯　河南省泌阳县紧密结合秋季生产，大力开展无蝇食堂运动。全县从6月28日开始，经过连续突击，目前苍蝇密度普遍下降，卫生面貌焕然一新，并涌现出一批基本上达到无蝇程度的食堂。
    夏季以来，随着卫生积肥运动的开展，全县绝大多数食堂都进行了“七改良”“三处理”，有效地预防了各种夏季流行病的发生。但是6月份以来，由于广大群众忙于抗旱抢种，放松了食堂的卫生工作，蚊蝇又开始孳生起来，特别是苍蝇的密度显著上升。为了及时消灭苍蝇，中共泌阳县委于6月下旬专门召开各公社党委书记电话会议，下达了除害灭病指示，要求社、队党委书记亲自挂帅，发动群众大力开展无蝇食堂运动。县委还提出了食堂“四有”（即有卫生员、有捕蝇器、食物有纱罩、炊事员有围裙）、“三净”（食物净、炊具净、厨房打扫净）、“三无”（无霉烂食物、无积存污水、无蝇）的具体要求。
    为了加强领导，县、社、队都确定一个党委委员负责指挥，县、社建立了“除害灭病指挥部”，大队成立了卫生领导小组，食堂都固定了卫生员，层层负责，加强领导，一抓到底。在充分发动群众的基础上，各地运用了捕、熏、毒、诱、挖（蛆蛹）和粪便无害化处理、清除垃圾、填垫死坑等方法，掀起了群众性的灭蝇运动。赊湾公社党委抽出三个党委委员，分片指挥，组织干部和医务人员八十七人，普遍督促检查，推动各大队利用饭前饭后时间，开展了食物大搬家，炊具大刷洗，厨房大清扫运动。马谷田公社三百九十三个食堂，过去有四十七个食堂卫生制度不健全。通过这次卫生运动，一般都实行了病号隔离，专人照顾；食物有人鉴定，炊具勤刷洗，经常检查评比等制度，使全社原有的四十一个三类食堂，有二十四个升了级。
