    Anshan Iron and Steel Complex Comprehensively Utilizes Waste Materials
    All factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are making full use of waste water, waste residue, waste gas, and leftover scraps to vigorously develop diversified operations and comprehensive utilization. From the company down to the factories and mines, functional organizations for comprehensively utilizing resources have been established, equipped with cadres and technical personnel, and plans have been formulated. To date, more than sixty comprehensive utilization factories and workshops have been built. In just over two months, they have used various waste materials to produce more than 140 kinds of building materials, electromechanical equipment, chemical raw materials, medicines, and daily necessities, such as activated slag cement, fiberboard, small electric motors, carbolic acid, and soda.

    Wang Jinshan Production Team Develops a Style of Thrift
    The Wang Jinshan Insulation and Painting Production Team of Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company focuses on saving every bit and using substitute materials. With the attitude of masters who love the factory more than their homes, they treat the cause of socialist construction with diligence and thrift. Not only do they use old materials instead of new ones, but they also vigorously research and find substitute materials, and have built five units for producing raw materials. While ensuring the quality of the project, they have used 48 kinds of waste materials, old materials, and substitute materials in production. In the first seven months of this year, they have saved more than 400,000 yuan, equivalent to not receiving materials for four months.

    Four Hundred Railway Cadres from Taiyuan Go to the Grassroots
    Workers of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau have launched a surge of transporting more coal and transporting it faster to ensure that coal mines can ship all that is produced. The bureau has selected more than 400 cadres to form more than 50 working groups to go deep into the grassroots, labor alongside the workers, consult with them, and solve key problems. In the first four days of August, they transported 374 more trainloads of coal than in the same period last month.

    Six Measures for Commercial Support of Steel Production
    Commercial workers in Chongqing have adopted six measures of "collecting, sorting, visiting, delivering, conceding, and adjusting" to "provide grain and fodder" for steel production. "Collecting" means purchasing, "sorting" means clearing warehouses and queuing up for comprehensive arrangements, "visiting" means visiting to understand needs, "delivering" means actively delivering materials, "conceding" means making every effort to give way to ensure the needs of steel production, and "adjusting" means organizing adjustments. They have recently organized nearly 100 million yuan worth of materials to supply the steel, coal, and coking production departments.

    Commercial Cadres Visit Furnaces
    Leading cadres such as the heads of finance and trade departments of various district committees in Tianjin, directors of various district commercial bureaus, and party branch secretaries and managers of purchasing stations and urban companies, have recently gone to various steel mills to understand the key issues in steel production by visiting furnaces, holding forums, and other means, and trying to help solve them. For example, the paint and chemical store of the Chemical Purchasing and Supply Station organized store employees to overcome difficulties and found 16 tons of paint, baking soda, calcium carbonate, and other materials for Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant and Rolling Mill No. 1, which were delivered in a timely manner to ensure the urgent needs of steel production.

    "One-Dragon" Ore Roasting Method
    The Houba Mining Field of Zunyi Iron and Steel Plant in Guizhou Province has recently collectively created the "One-Dragon Ore Roasting Method." This ore roasting method involves continuous burning on the ground and does not require a fixed ore roasting kiln. Using this method increases output by two times compared to the Dafang kiln roasting method, reduces the sulfur content of the ore by up to 11 percent, saves three-quarters of the labor force, saves half the coal, saves more than 90 percent of the firewood, increases the roasting rate from 80 percent to over 90 percent, and increases the iron content of the ore from the original 40 percent to 45 to 55 percent. At the same time, it reduces the labor intensity of workers.
