    Strengthen Ideological Education  Establish Responsibility System
    Happy Pig Farm Transforms from Backward to Advanced
    Due to the implementation of the pig raising responsibility system, the survival rate of piglets increased from 65% to 98%; for more than a year, not a single pig has died from disease.
    
    Nanchang, August 5th (From Our Newspaper) – The Happy Pig Farm in the suburbs of Jiujiang City, Jiangxi Province, used to raise few pigs, with slow growth and a high mortality rate. Since the implementation of the pig raising production responsibility system, the situation has drastically changed, and it has become a model pig farm in the Jiujiang Special District. The Jiujiang Prefectural Committee and the Jiujiang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China believe that the Happy Pig Farm's set of pig raising responsibility systems is complete, specific, and practical. Vigorously promoting this set of responsibility systems is of great importance to running pig farms well and raising pigs well currently. Therefore, they recently summarized the experience of this farm in establishing the pig raising responsibility system and introduced it to the entire district for promotion.
    
    The Happy Pig Farm is located on the shore of Poyang Lake and belongs to the Happy Brigade of the Gangkou Commune. Since 1959, this farm has conscientiously implemented the pig raising production responsibility system. The pigs are well-raised, grow quickly, and the farm is well-run and develops rapidly. The total number of pigs raised on the farm has increased from more than 100 to 320, the survival rate of piglets has increased from 65% to over 98%, and for more than a year, not a single pig has died from disease. The growth rate of live pigs has also greatly accelerated compared to the past.
    
    The Happy Pig Farm established the pig raising responsibility system in the context of the great development of pig raising. This farm was established in March 1956. In the same year, due to lack of experience and the absence of necessary responsibility systems, seven of the thirty-six pigs raised on the farm ran away, and nine drowned. Only twenty pigs remained at the end of the year. Since then, it has continuously learned from its mistakes, created experience, and successively established some responsibility systems, which have played a significant role in developing pig raising and consolidating the pig farm. However, because these systems were very imperfect and their implementation was not firm enough, the responsibility and enthusiasm of the feeders were not fully mobilized, pig raising development was still not very rapid, disease and death phenomena occurred frequently, and the growth of pigs was also slow. At the beginning of 1959, the brigade vigorously developed pig raising. As the number of pigs increased, the number of feeders also increased. Under these circumstances, the leaders of the farm conducted research on how to run the farm well and raise pigs well, and believed that a very important aspect was to establish a complete pig raising responsibility system. Therefore, the farm leaders mobilized all feeders, administrators, and epidemic prevention personnel to summarize past experiences in running the farm and raising pigs, including: fixing the feeder team, assigning people and pigs; contracting tasks, fixing output; reasonable remuneration, fixing work points; fixing costs; scientific feeding and epidemic prevention, fixing management responsibilities; fixing fertilizer; fixing rewards and punishments. A set of pig raising responsibility systems with the above contents was thus born in the Happy Pig Farm.
    
    The key to implementing the pig raising responsibility system lies in the feeders having a high degree of consciousness. The measures taken by the Happy Pig Farm in this regard are: First, select commune members with good ideology, great enthusiasm, and strong determination to serve as feeders. Among the eleven feeders on the farm, there are five Party members, League members, and five activists, who are all of poor and lower-middle peasant origin and love the collective pig raising undertaking. Second, frequently conduct political education for the feeders, with two evenings of political classes per week, to enhance the feeders' understanding of developing the collective pig raising undertaking and enable them to consciously implement the pig raising responsibility system. Third, the farm regularly or irregularly holds symposiums, experience exchange meetings, and technical learning meetings, and frequently sends people to visit and study in other places to improve feeding and management techniques, so that the feeders can better implement the pig raising responsibility system. In addition, the farm also established Wen Xuerong, a feeder with red ideology, sufficient enthusiasm, and good implementation of the responsibility system, as a model for the entire farm, organized everyone to learn from the model, catch up with the model, launched competitions, and encouraged the feeders to conscientiously implement the pig raising responsibility system.
    
    The brigade Party branch attaches great importance to the promotion of the responsibility system in the pig farm. In addition to designating a secretary to be specifically responsible for leading the work of the pig farm, it also sent a capable cadre to serve as the farm director. At the same time, it inspects the implementation of the pig raising responsibility system once every half month and studies and solves the problems found in the inspection, which ensures the promotion of the pig raising responsibility system.

    加强思想教育  建立责任制度
    幸福猪场由落后变先进
    由于实行养猪责任制，小猪成活率由百分之六十五提高到百分之九十八；一年多来没有因为疫病死亡一头猪。
    本报南昌5日电　江西九江市郊区幸福养猪场，过去养猪少、生长慢、死亡率高，自从推行养猪生产责任制以后，局面大变，一跃而成为九江专区养猪场的标兵。中共九江地委、九江市委认为，幸福养猪场的一套养猪责任制度既完整、具体，又切合实际，大力推行这套责任制度，对当前办好猪场、养好猪有重要作用。因此最近总结了这个场建立养猪责任制的经验，向全区介绍推广。
    幸福养猪场位于鄱阳湖畔，属港口公社幸福大队。这个场自1959年起认真推行了养猪生产责任制以后，猪养得好、生长快，场办得好、发展快。全场养猪已由原来一百多头发展到三百二十头，小猪成活率由65％提高到98％以上，一年多来没有因为发生病疫死亡一头猪。生猪成长速度也比过去大大加快。
    幸福养猪场是在养猪大发展的形势下建立起养猪责任制的。这个场于1956年3月建场，当年由于缺乏经验，没有建立必要的责任制度，全场养的三十六头猪逃走了七头，淹死了九头，年底只剩下了二十头。此后，不断吸取教训，创造经验，先后建立一些责任制度，对发展养猪、巩固养猪场起到了很大作用。可是因为这些制度很不完善，再加执行不够坚决，仍然没有充分调动起饲养员的责任心与积极性，养猪发展仍不很快，病疫死亡现象经常发生，猪的成长也较慢。1959年年初，大队大力发展养猪，随着养猪数量的增加，饲养员也增多了。在这种情况下，场部领导对怎样办好场、养好猪的问题进行了研究，认为很重要的一环是建立一套完善的养猪责任制。于是场领导发动全场饲养员、管理员、防疫员总结过去的办场养猪经验，包括：固定饲养员队伍，定人、定猪；包干任务，固定产量；合理计酬，固定工分；定成本；科学饲养防疫，固定管理责任；定肥料；定奖惩等内容的一套养猪责任制度就在幸福养猪场产生了。
    执行养猪责任制的关键在于饲养员具有高度的自觉性。幸福养猪场在这方面采取的措施是，首先选择思想好、干劲大、钻劲足的社员担任饲养员。全场十一个饲养员中就有五个党、团员，五个积极分子，他们都是贫雇农成分，热爱集体养猪事业。其次，经常对饲养员进行政治教育，一周上两晚的政治课，以提高饲养员对发展集体养猪事业的认识，使他们自觉地执行养猪责任制。再次，场部定期或不定期地召开座谈会、经验交流会、技术学习会，并经常派人到外地参观学习，以提高饲养管理技术，便于饲养员更好地执行养猪责任制。此外，场部还树立思想红、干劲足、执行责任制度好的饲养员文学荣为全场标兵，组织大家学标兵、赶标兵，开展竞赛，鼓励饲养员认真执行养猪责任制。
    大队党支部对养猪场推广责任制十分重视，除了指定一名书记专门负责领导养猪场的工作外，还派出了一名得力干部担任场长；同时，半月检查一次执行养猪责任制的情况，研究解决检查中发现的问题，这就保证了养猪责任制的推行。（附图片）
