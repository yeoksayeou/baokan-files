The "On-site Consultation System" and "Small Group/Class Balanced Planning System" we implemented throughout the mine this year have powerfully promoted the development of production. The entire mine has achieved steady increases in production, month after month, and victoriously completed the production plans for January to July.

The "On-site Consultation System" means that every week, leading cadres and engineering technicians from the pits and work areas go deep into each group and team, and together with the workers, they conduct on-the-spot research on production problems, take on-the-spot measures, and solve them on-the-spot, and formulate production plans for the following week. Cadres and technicians also help the groups and teams to draw up work diagrams and compile plans. This system ensures that workshop leading cadres can devote more time to going deep into production, leading production, discovering contradictions, and resolving contradictions; at the same time, it encourages employees to care about production and participate in enterprise management with a sense of responsibility as masters.

The "Small Group/Class Balanced Planning System" is a new product after the comprehensive promotion of four-eight staggered operations. The implementation of four-eight staggered operations involves more shifts and two hours of crossover time, which requires more meticulous, detailed, and reliable production plans. The specific practice of this system is: within one hour of starting work, the group leaders and team leaders of each production group and team thoroughly check the on-site ore preparation, study the production effect that this small shift can achieve, and report to the work area leader, who organizes the balance, as the fighting goal of the entire area for the shift. This overcomes the shortcomings of the past where workers set production quotas without seeing the actual on-site situation; at the same time, because the planned figures are proposed by the group based on their own actual situation, the workers are more likely to try every possible means to achieve the plan, and generally only exceed it rather than fail to complete it.

The "On-site Consultation System" and "Small Group/Class Balanced Planning System" have developed in the struggle against old habits such as "a few people managing the plan." Facts have proved that they have many benefits for promoting production. We have established them as important management systems and are constantly improving them.

### 现场会诊制和小组班计划平衡制大有好处

    现场会诊制和小组班计划平衡制大有好处
    今年我们在全矿范围内推行了“现场会诊制”和“小组班计划平衡制”，有力地推进了生产的发展。全矿实现了生产步步高，月月红，胜利地完成了1至7月份的生产计划。
    “现场会诊制”就是每周由坑、工区的领导干部、工程技术人员深入到每个组、队，和工人一起对生产中的问题就地研究，就地采取措施，就地解决，并且制订下周生产计划。干部和技术人员还帮助组、队绘制作业图，编计划。这种制度保证了车间领导干部能抽出更多的时间深入生产，领导生产，发现矛盾，解决矛盾；同时，鼓舞着职工以主人翁的责任感关心生产，参加企业管理。
    “小组班计划平衡制”是全面推广四八交叉作业以后的新产物。实行四八交叉作业，班次较多，并有两个小时的交叉时间，这就要求生产计划更加周密细致，切实可靠。这种制度的具体作法是：每个生产组、队的组长、队长在上班后的一个小时内，详细检查现场的矿量准备情况，研究本小班所能达到的生产效果，汇报给工区长，由工区长组织平衡，作为当班全区的奋斗目标。这样便克服了过去工人没有看到现场实际情况就定产的缺点；同时，因为计划数字是由小组结合本组实际情况提出的，工人们更能千方百计地去实现计划，一般只有超额而不会完不成。
      “现场会诊制”和“小组班计划平衡制”，是在同“少数人管计划”等旧习惯的斗争中发展起来的。事实证明，它们对推动生产有很多好处。我们已经把它们作为重要的管理制度确定下来，并使之不断完善。
