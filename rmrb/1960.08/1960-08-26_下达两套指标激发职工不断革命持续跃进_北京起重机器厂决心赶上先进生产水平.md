Issuing Two Sets of Targets to Stimulate Workers' Continuous Revolution and Sustained Leap Forward
　　Beijing Lifting Machinery Plant Determined to Catch Up with Advanced Production Levels

　　(Our report) Beijing Lifting Machinery Plant combined the discussion of increasing production and practicing economy plans with the mass movement of learning from and catching up with advanced workers. While discussing the plant's planned quotas, they also discussed the advanced targets of fraternal factories. The clear contrast between the two sets of planned targets issued to the workers greatly stimulated the workers' revolutionary zeal, prompting the continuous improvement of product output and quality.

　　Since the beginning of this year, with the development of production, the plant has repeatedly revised and raised its production plan targets. In order to fulfill and over fulfill this year's leap forward plan, they have repeatedly organized workers to visit and learn from fraternal factories, comparing and analyzing the indicators of each process of crane production in their own factory with those of fraternal factories. They sought advanced experiences from the advanced indicators of fraternal factories, and convened worker representative conferences to report on the learned experiences, mobilizing workers to combine the discussion of the plant's production plan with the formulation of plans to learn from and catch up with the advanced. They simultaneously issued the advanced indicators of other factories and the plant's planned quotas to each workshop, and each workshop filled the two sets of indicators for manufacturing each part and each process on the work task sheets, which were then issued to each worker. The workers not only discussed the comprehensive indicators and measures of the workshop and work section, but also discussed at the pre-shift meetings individual plans on how to catch up with advanced levels, closely combining learning from and catching up with the advanced with over fulfilling the state production plan.

　　After implementing this method, the entire plant was filled with a vibrant scene of vigorous technical innovation and catching up with each other. The workers both learned and created, applying many advanced experiences to production. Li Chun, a planer in the bridge crane workshop, used to take more than an hour to process a crane's brake arm, more than double the man-hours of the Dalian Lifting Machinery Plant. Within three days, he rushed to make a special die, and increased the speed of the lathe, shortening the processing time of the brake arm to twenty minutes, increasing production efficiency by more than two times, breaking through the production quota, and exceeding the advanced level of fraternal factories. The sand turning group three, with a smaller working area, comprehensively applied the experience of pattern sand turning from Dalian Lifting Machinery Plant, the experience of tightly arranged sand boxes and rational utilization of sand turning area from Tianjin Lifting Machinery Plant, and the experience of using stacked boxes to cast parts from Beijing Jiandu Iron Factory to the production of more than twenty kinds of parts blanks, making the output of these castings increase sharply by one to two times, and the scrap rate dropped from 8% to 4.1%, catching up with the advanced level.

　　The plant's issuance of two sets of targets to workers and continuous learning from and catching up with the advanced has resulted in a situation where production is rising steadily, and the state plan is being over fulfilled comprehensively every month. In the first seven and a half months of this year, the output of major products, profits turned over to the state, labor productivity, and total output value have all increased by about one time compared to the same period last year, the product quality is all qualified, and the cost has been reduced by 13.8%.

    下达两套指标激发职工不断革命持续跃进
    北京起重机器厂决心赶上先进生产水平
    本报讯　北京起重机器厂工人讨论增产节约计划跟学先进、赶先进的群众运动结合起来，在讨论本厂计划定额的同时，讨论兄弟厂的先进指标。通过下达给工人的两套计划指标鲜明的对比，大大激发了职工们的革命干劲，促使产品的产量、质量不断提高。
    今年以来，随着生产的发展，这个厂多次修订提高了生产计划指标。为了完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划，他们多次组织职工到兄弟厂参观学习，把本厂生产起重机每道工序的指标和兄弟厂的指标逐项进行比较分析，从兄弟厂的先进指标中寻找先进经验，并且召开职工代表大会报告学习到的经验，发动职工把讨论本厂生产计划和制订学先进、赶先进计划结合起来，将外厂的先进指标和本厂的计划定额同时下达到各个车间，各车间又将制造每个零件、每个工序的两套指标，填写在工作任务单上，下达给每个工人。工人们不仅讨论车间、工段的全面指标和措施，还在班前会上讨论个人如何赶上先进水平的计划，把学先进、赶先进和超额完成国家生产计划紧密地结合起来。
    实行这种办法以后，全厂到处是一片大闹技术革新、你追我赶、生气勃勃的景象。工人们既学习又创造，把许多先进经验应用到生产上来。桥式起重机车间刨工李春加工起重机的制动臂，过去要一小时多加工一个，比大连起重机器厂的工时多一倍。他在三天内赶制了一个专用胎具，又把车床的转速加大，使制动臂的加工时间缩短到二十分钟，生产效率提高了两倍多，突破了生产定额，也超过了兄弟厂的先进水平。工作面积较小的翻砂三组，把大连起重机器厂型板翻砂的经验、天津起重机器厂紧密排列砂箱、合理利用翻砂面积的经验和北京建都铁工厂用叠箱法铸零件的经验，综合应用到二十几种零件毛坯的生产，使这些铸件的产量猛增一倍到两倍，废品率由8％降低到4.1％，赶上了先进水平。
    这个厂向工人下达两套指标，不断学先进、赶先进的结果，出现了生产节节上升，月月全面超额完成国家计划的局面。今年前七个半月主要产品的产量、上缴利润、劳动生产率和总产值都比去年同期提高了一倍左右，产品质量全部合格，成本降低了13.8％。
