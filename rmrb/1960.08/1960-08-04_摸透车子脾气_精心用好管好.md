Xu Zhenhuan, a driver from the First Motorcade of the Jinan Automobile Transportation Company in Shandong, consistently takes great care of his vehicles. He and his partners, Zhang Zunzhi and Wang Chunsheng, who take turns driving a five-ton "Citroen" truck, have not had any major mechanical failures in their shift for sixteen months, from March of last year to July of this year. The good vehicle rate is often maintained above 99%.

The "Citroen" truck that Xu Zhenhuan drives is a type of diesel vehicle. The power of the transmission part of this type of car is not consistent with the power of the engine. If it is started or climbed uphill with difficulty, the mechanical parts are easily damaged. After Xu Zhenhuan understood the temperament of this type of car, he always drove carefully. When parking, he always chooses relatively flat and solid ground; when encountering slopes, he never blindly rushes up the slope, but always shifts gears early according to the length and size of the slope.

In order to protect the vehicle's mechanical parts from damage, Xu Zhenhuan is never afraid of trouble. The car he drives often undertakes the task of transporting ore and sand. The loading locations are not very fixed, and the road conditions are generally poor. Every time after loading the car, when he estimates that it will be difficult to tow it all at once, he first tows the trailer to a flat road in several times, and then tows it away at once. Sometimes when he encounters a large slope, he estimates that it will be difficult to climb the slope with four trailers, so he disconnects them and tows them over in several times. This avoids damage to the mechanical parts and reduces repair downtime.

    摸透车子脾气  精心用好管好
    山东济南汽车运输公司第一汽车队司机徐振环，一贯精心爱护车辆。他和他的伙伴张遵智、王春生等轮班驾驶的一辆五吨“雪铁龙”牌汽车，从去年3月到今年7月，十六个月来，在他们班上没有发生过重大机件损坏事故，好车率经常保持在99％以上。
    徐振环开的“雪铁龙”车，是一种柴油汽车。这种车子的传动部分的力气和引擎的力气不一致，假若勉强起动或冲坡，机件就容易损坏。徐振环摸透了这种车子的脾气以后，在驾驶中总是细心行驶。停车时，他总选择比较平坦、硬实的地面停下；遇到坡道，他向来不盲目冲坡，都是根据坡的长短大小，及早换档。
    为了保护车辆机件不受损伤，徐振环从来不怕麻烦。他开的车经常担负运输矿石、砂子的任务，装车地点不很固定，而且道路的条件一般比较差。每次装好车后，他估计一次拖挂有困难时，就分几次把拖斗先拖到平坦的公路上，然后再一次拖走；有时遇到大坡道，他估计拖着四个挂斗爬坡有困难时，就摘开分几次拖过去。这样便避免了机件损坏，减少了修车停驶时间。
