Albanian "Labor News" Praises China's Struggle for Peaceful Coexistence Among Nations. Japanese "Akahata" Exposes That the Imperialist Countries Headed by the United States Oppose Peaceful Coexistence. Indonesian "Dawn Daily" Points out that China is Committed to Achieving a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Peaceful Region. Cambodian "Unity Newspaper" Believes that Premier Zhou's Initiative Fully Conforms to the Ideas of Peace-Loving People. Some British and French Newspapers Criticize the U.S. State Department's Unreasonable Rejection of Premier Zhou's Peace Initiative as Barbaric.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, August 5th: The Albanian "Labor News" published a commentary today on Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the Swiss Confederation National Day reception on August 1st.

The commentary said that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal to build Asia and the Pacific region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone is in line with the interests of the people of Asian countries and serves the cause of world peace, therefore it has won the full support of the people of Asian countries. This once again shows that the People's Republic of China is fighting for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

The commentary said that the imperialists shamelessly slander that China has abandoned the policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, but the facts prove quite the contrary, as Premier Zhou Enlai said, China has signed treaties of friendship and mutual non-aggression and treaties of peace and friendship with Burma and Nepal respectively; it also has good relations with Afghanistan, Ceylon, and Cambodia; and it also strives for peaceful coexistence with other Asian countries, such as India and Indonesia.

The commentary said that, of course, the imperialists have consistently tried to belittle China's role, and concoct all kinds of futile slanders to oppose China. They deny China's legitimate status in the United Nations, and they also try to oppose China through the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. However, the heroic Chinese people will never yield. The Chinese people are working selflessly and have achieved a series of victories in all aspects. The Chinese people are resolute defenders of peace in Asia and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party organ "Akahata" published an editorial today, expressing its support for Premier Zhou Enlai's peace initiative on concluding a treaty of mutual non-aggression among Asian and Pacific coastal countries and building the entire region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

The editorial emphasized that the Soviet Union and China have put forward a series of specific proposals to strive for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs, disarmament, and the implementation of peaceful coexistence, which has promoted the progress of the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. Premier Zhou further suggested on the 1st that a treaty of mutual non-aggression be concluded among Pacific coastal countries, including the United States, and that a nuclear-weapon-free zone be established.

The editorial pointed out that the reason why the realization of these rational proposals is being obstructed is because the imperialist countries headed by the United States oppose peaceful coexistence and still adhere to the "Cold War" policy.

"Akahata" emphasized that, therefore, in order to achieve the goal of the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, the Japanese people must resolutely fight against the forces that obstruct the realization of this goal, force them to change their policies, and remove all obstacles.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 4th: The Indonesian "Dawn Daily" published an editorial today stating that all countries and people who cherish peace should welcome Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal to conclude a treaty of mutual non-aggression among Asian and Pacific coastal countries in order to make this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

The editorial pointed out that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal shows that, contrary to the claims of Western imperialists, China does not want to expand outwards, but is committed to achieving a nuclear-weapon-free peaceful region. The Western imperialists' claim that China wants to expand outwards is just an excuse to establish missile bases in Asian countries, especially in all the vassal states participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization.

The newspaper pointed out that anyone can draw the conclusion from the above facts as to who wants peace and who wants war.

The newspaper finally expressed the hope that the Indonesian government and people will take this initiative of Premier Zhou seriously and warmly welcome it. The newspaper also hopes that other Asian countries will adopt this attitude. It pointed out that such a peace treaty would benefit all the people of Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, August 5th: Phnom Penh Radio broadcast a commentary on the 3rd, supporting Premier Zhou Enlai's initiative on concluding a treaty of mutual non-aggression among Asian and Pacific coastal countries and building this region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. The radio commentary said that this initiative "is in the interest of all Asian countries, which need peace and stability in order to overcome the state of being economically backward compared to the Western world." The commentary also said, "We Cambodians hope that Premier Zhou Enlai's appeal will be considered, and hope that those who adopt a hostile attitude towards the People's China will not miss the opportunity to end the Cold War, and should at least begin to discuss with the representatives of the 650 million Chinese people."

The commentary welcomed proposals sufficient to end the tension in Asia. The commentary said, "We fully maintain our confidence in peaceful coexistence, although the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are sometimes severely tested, because we are convinced that this is the only path that conforms to the progress of all peoples and nations."

"Unity Newspaper" published a commentary today stating that Premier Zhou Enlai's initiative to Asian and Pacific countries to conclude a treaty of mutual non-aggression and build this region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone is wise and fully conforms to the ideas of peace-loving people.

The newspaper said that there are two attitudes: the broad masses of good people resolutely welcome all opinions and proposals that oppose war and create conditions for peace, especially at a time when the imperialists are trying to ignite the flames of war, Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal is a righteous and exciting warm current. Conversely, the imperialists say that this is "Communist propaganda." The newspaper pointed out that the imperialists say this in order to deceive the people, because they want to maintain and intensify tensions, and they need to create a Cold War.

The newspaper said that no matter what the imperialists say, the people still welcome opinions that strive for peace. The newspaper also pointed out that as long as the people have confidence and fight, this proposal will be realized and the imperialists will be defeated.

Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: Some British and French newspapers welcome Premier Zhou Enlai's peace initiative on Asian and Pacific coastal countries signing a treaty of mutual non-aggression and building the entire region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and criticize the U.S. State Department's unreasonable attitude in rejecting this initiative.

The British "Tribune" weekly said in an article today entitled "Accept this New Suggestion": "There is no need to elaborate on the merits of this suggestion. Establishing a nuclear-weapon-free Pacific region would be a greater step towards a peaceful world than establishing a nuclear-weapon-free Europe, because in world politics, many of the most combustible factors are concentrated in this region." It believes that Premier Zhou's speech expressed "China's long-term interests."

The article condemned the U.S. State Department's hasty rejection of China's proposal as a "knee-jerk reaction" and an action that was "more disappointing than usual." It believes that the reason why the United States rejected China's peace proposal so impatiently is because it fears that "these proposals may be completely sincere, thereby rendering nine-tenths of the public speeches of the two presidential candidates (i.e., clamoring for arms expansion and war preparation and anti-China and anti-communism - [Xinhua News Agency editor]) nonsense." The weekly criticized the U.S. State Department's rejection of China's proposal as "another piece of evidence, showing the State Department figures' renowned inability to think."

The French "Liberation" reported on the 2nd of Premier Zhou's talk on signing a peace treaty and establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone. It pointed out that this proposal is conducive to peaceful coexistence, but Washington does not welcome this proposal.

On the same day, the French "Combat" reported the news with four columns. The newspaper accused the United States of "adopting a negative attitude towards Beijing's proposal." It believes that this attitude is "mainly because the U.S. government has closed itself in a situation that cannot be escaped, refusing to change its relationship with Communist China." The newspaper believes that "Washington will inevitably have to consider the opinions of the Beijing government sooner or later."

    各国舆论热烈欢迎周总理和平倡议
    指出中国人民是世界和平的坚决保卫者，和平共处的障碍来自美帝国主义
    阿尔巴尼亚“劳动报”赞扬中国为争取各国之间的和平共处而斗争  日本“赤旗报”揭露反对和平共处的是以美国为首的帝国主义国家  印度尼西亚“黎明日报”指出中国致力于实现无核武器的和平地区  柬埔寨“统一报”认为周总理的倡议完全符合爱好和平人民的想法  英法一些报刊抨击美国国务院无理拒绝周总理和平倡议的蛮横态度
    新华社地拉那5日电　阿尔巴尼亚“劳动报”今天就周恩来总理1日在瑞士联邦国庆日招待会上的讲话发表了评论。
    评论说，周恩来总理关于把亚洲和太平洋地区建成没有核武器区的建议是符合亚洲各国人民的利益，并服务于世界和平事业，因此赢得了亚洲各国人民的完全支持。这再次表明：中华人民共和国是为争取不同社会制度国家间和平共处而斗争的。
    评论说，帝国主义者无耻地诬蔑说，中国放弃了不同社会制度的国家间和平共处的政策，但事实证明却完全相反，正如周恩来总理所说的，中国同缅甸、尼泊尔分别签订了友好和互不侵犯条约和和平友好条约；同阿富汗、锡兰、柬埔寨也有很好的关系；同其他亚洲国家，例如印度、印度尼西亚，也力求和平共处。
    评论说，当然，帝国主义者一贯地力图贬低中国的作用，臆造各种枉费心机的诬蔑来反对中国。他们否认中国在联合国的合法地位，他们还力图通过侵略性的东南亚条约组织来反对中国。但是，英勇的中国人民是永远也不会屈服的。中国人民忘我地劳动，并在各个方面取得了一连串的胜利。中国人民是亚洲和世界和平的坚决的保卫者。
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，表示支持周恩来总理关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国缔结一个互不侵犯的和平公约和把这整个地区建成为无核武器的地区的和平倡议。
    社论强调指出，苏联和中国为了争取禁止原子弹氢弹、裁减军备、实行和平共处，曾经提出了一系列的具体建议，促使禁止原子弹氢弹运动取得了进展。周总理更在1日建议缔结太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内的互不侵犯条约并设立无核武装地带。
    社论指出，这些合理的建议的实现所以被阻挠，是因为以美国为首的帝国主义国家反对和平共处，仍然坚持“冷战”政策。
    “赤旗报”强调指出，因此，为了实现禁止原子弹氢弹运动的目标，日本人民必须对阻挠实现这个目的的势力坚决进行斗争，迫使它们改变政策，扫除一切障碍。
    新华社雅加达4日电　印度尼西亚“黎明日报”今天发表社论说，一切珍视和平的国家和人民都应当欢迎周恩来总理提出的关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国缔结互不侵犯的和平公约以便使这个地区成为无核武器地区的建议。
    社论指出，周恩来总理的建议表明，同西方帝国主义者的说法相反，中国不想向外扩张，而是要致力于实现无核武器的和平地区。西方帝国主义者所说的中国要向外扩张的说法只不过是为了在亚洲国家，首先是在参加东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织的所有附属国建立火箭基地寻找借口。
    报纸指出，任何人都可以根据上述事实得出到底是谁要和平、谁要战争的结论。
    报纸最后表示希望，印度尼西亚政府和人民将认真对待和热烈欢迎周总理的这项倡议。报纸还希望其他亚洲国家也采取这种态度。它指出，这种和平公约将会给亚洲全体人民带来好处。
    新华社金边5日电　金边电台3日发表评论，支持周恩来总理关于在亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国缔结一项互不侵犯的和平公约并把这一地区建成无核武器地区的倡议。电台评论说，这一倡议“是所有亚洲国家的利益所在，它们需要和平和稳定，以便克服经济上落后于西方世界的状态”。评论还说，“我们柬埔寨人希望周恩来总理的呼吁受到考虑，希望对人民中国采取敌视态度的人们不要放过结束冷战的机会，至少应该着手同六亿五千万中国人的代表们商谈。”
    评论表示欢迎足以结束亚洲的紧张局势的建议。评论说，“我们完全保持着对和平共处的信心，虽然和平共处的五项原则有时受到严重的考验，因为我们确信这是唯一符合各国人民和民族的进步的道路”。
    “统一报”今天发表评论说，周恩来总理向亚洲和太平洋国家提出缔结互不侵犯的和平公约并把这一地区建成无核武器地区的倡议是明智的，完全符合爱好和平人民的想法。
    这家报纸说，有两种态度，广大的善良人民坚决欢迎反对战争和为和平创造条件的一切意见和主张，特别是在帝国主义者正在企图燃起战火的时候，周恩来总理的建议是正义的和令人兴奋的暖流。相反地，帝国主义者说，这是“共产党的宣传”。这家报纸指出，帝国主义者这样说，目的是要欺骗人民，因为它想要保持和加剧紧张局势，他们需要制造冷战。
    这家报纸说，不管帝国主义者说什么，但是人民仍然欢迎争取和平的意见。这家报纸还指出，只要人民有信心和进行斗争，这个建议将会实现，帝国主义者将遭到失败。
    新华社5日讯　英国和法国的一些报纸欢迎周恩来总理关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国签订互不侵犯的和平公约，把整个地区建成为没有核武器地区的和平倡议，并且抨击美国国务院拒绝这一倡议的无理态度。
    英国“论坛”周报今天在一篇题为“接受这个新建议”的文章中说：“没有必要详细说明这项建议的优点。建立一个没有核武器的太平洋地区比建立一个没有核武器的欧洲会是朝着和平的世界迈出的更大的一步，因为在世界政治中，很多具有最大燃烧性的因素都集中在这个地区。”它认为，周总理的讲话表达了“中国的长远利益”。
    文章谴责美国国务院仓促地拒绝中国的建议是“条件反射”，是“比往常更加令人失望”的行动。它认为美国所以这样急不及待地拒绝中国的和平建议，是因为害怕“这些建议可能完全是真心实意的，从而使（美国）两位总统候选人的公开讲话的十分之九（即叫嚣扩军备战和反华反共的言论——（新华社编者）成为无稽之谈。”周报抨击美国国务院拒绝中国的建议“是又一证据，表明国务院人物闻名的没有思考问题的能力”。
    法国“解放报”2日报道了周总理关于签订和平公约和建立无核武器地区的谈话。它指出，这一建议有助于和平共处，但是华盛顿不欢迎这个建议。
    同日，法国“战斗报”以四栏篇幅报道了这一消息。这家报纸指责美国“对北京建议采取消极态度”。它认为，这种态度“主要是由于美国政府把自己关闭在不能解脱的局面里，拒绝改变同共产党中国的关系”。这家报纸认为，“华盛顿迟早必然要考虑北京政府的意见”。
