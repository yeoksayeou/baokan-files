    "Han Da"'s Transformation Shanghai Zhao Yuansan
    In the Shanghai Daxing Dyeing Factory, there is a young worker named Shou Rusong. In the past, people called him "Han Da" (simpleton): he couldn't do innovation, he couldn't handle production, he couldn't learn, he couldn't speak well. Chen Jiayi, the Party branch secretary, learned about this and went to the workshop to work with him. Once, Shou Rusong said, "I want to operate all this with electric buttons in the future!" Comrade Chen Jiayi then enthusiastically encouraged him: "Good! Think boldly, act bravely, if you're wrong, try again!" And he mentioned it at the branch meeting to ask everyone to support him. As a result, he became bolder and more motivated. After more than ten repeated experiments, he finally conquered the key innovations of the yarn-fastening machine and the doffing machine, becoming a youth shock worker in the factory. Now, everyone calls him an innovation fanatic, a master worker.
      "Han Da"'s transformation is of typical significance; "Han Da"'s transformation is thought-provoking.
    The wisdom of the masses is like an atomic nucleus. The responsibility of the leaders is to make full use of these atomic nuclei, to go deep among the masses, to promote rapid atomic explosions, and to liberate the wisdom hidden in the masses.
    The practice of the masses is the nursery of new things, new buds sprouting, emerging one after another. The vocation of the leader is to discover new buds and cultivate them; and only by going barefoot into the fields and observing carefully can good seedlings, bad seedlings, and weeds be clearly distinguished. "Han Da"'s short sentence, to our entire heroic working class, is extremely ordinary, but in "Han Da," it represents the budding of a communist ideology of daring to think and daring to act. Because Comrade Chen Jiayi lives among the masses, he understands this, so he enthusiastically encourages and strongly supports him. Under his careful cultivation, it finally grew into a big tree, transforming from someone who couldn't do innovation into an innovation fanatic, from someone who couldn't handle production into a master worker, and from "Han Da" into a shock worker.

    “憨大”的转变	上海　赵元三
    上海大兴漂染厂有位青工叫寿如松。过去人们都叫他“憨大”：革新革不来，生产干不来，学习学不来，讲话讲不来。党支部书记陈嘉艺得知，就下车间和他一块劳动。一次，寿如松讲了一句话：“我这里将来要全部揿电钮！”陈嘉艺同志于是就热情鼓励他：“好！大胆想，勇敢做，错了，再来！”并且提到支部大会上要大家支持。结果，他胆子大了，劲头来了，经过十几次反复试验，终于攻下扣纱机、落纱机两大革新关键，成了全厂的青年突击手。现在，大家都喊他革新迷、老师傅。
      “憨大”的转变是有典型意义的；“憨大”的转变发人深思。
    群众的智慧，像原子核。领导者的责任就是要把这些原子核充分利用起来。深入到群众之中，促使迅速发生原子爆发，使群众中所蕴藏的智慧都解放出来。
    群众的实践，是新生事物的苗圃，新芽萌生，丛出不穷。领导者的天职就在于发现新芽，加以培育；而只有赤脚下田，精心观察，好苗、坏苗、杂草，才能一目了然。“憨大”的短短一句话，对我国整个英勇的工人阶级来说，是极平凡的，而在“憨大”，却正代表着敢想、敢做的共产主义思想的萌芽。陈嘉艺同志由于生活在群众之中，所以才懂得了这一点，于是热情鼓励，大力支持，在其悉心培育之下，终于成长为大树，由革新革不来变成革新迷，由生产干不来变成老师傅，由“憨大”变成了突击手。
