    Leading Cadres Go Deep to Help Grassroots Reasonably Arrange Labor Force
    Yulin Prefecture Adds New Force for Weeding and Topdressing
    Jianxing Commune Mobilizes the Masses to Tap Labor Potential, More Than 2,000 People Strengthen the Agricultural Front Line

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Shaanxi Daily: Leading cadres at all levels in Yulin Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, have gone deep into the rural areas to help counties, communes, and production teams concentrate and tap labor forces to strengthen the grain production front. Currently, 250,000 laborers have been transferred from various aspects. Together with the original labor force, 90% of the labor force in the region (totaling 750,000 people) has been投入into the battle of weeding and topdressing. The daily progress of weeding has been accelerated threefold.

    This year, the area sown with autumn crops in Yulin Prefecture is much larger than last year. Coupled with the recent rainy weather, weeds are rampant, so weeding and topdressing require a large amount of labor. In order to do a good job in field management for weeding and topdressing, several leaders of the Prefectural Committee led a group of cadres to conduct specific investigations and studies in various counties, communes, and production teams. During the investigation, it was found that the leading cadres of some counties, communes, and production teams were not aggressive enough in concentrating labor to grasp grain production, and they were still handling affairs according to the labor force plans of previous years; the use of labor was too scattered. The Prefectural Committee immediately held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee in Qingyunshan Management Area of the Chengguan Commune in Yulin County, specifically studying the labor arrangements of the Cuijiafan and Qingyun production teams. For example, in the Cuijiafan team, the labor force投入ed in water conservancy, transportation, brick and tile factories, highways, and canteens accounted for 48.8% of the total labor force, while those participating in field production accounted for 51.2% of the total labor force. Due to insufficient labor, more than 500 mu of autumn fields in the entire team had not been weeded, and only a few had been weeded twice. The Standing Committee meeting believed that from the labor arrangement of Cuijiafan, it could be seen that some comrades did not have a deep understanding of the extremely important significance of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and grain as the foundation of agriculture. Immediately afterwards, the Prefectural Committee held a telephone conference, calling on all localities to resolutely concentrate all available labor forces to strengthen the current field management work centered on weeding and topdressing.

    The counties responded to the call of the Prefectural Committee and acted quickly. Yulin County, based on the principle that rural basic construction such as water conservancy must be subordinate to current agricultural production and carried out in stages and batches on the premise of ensuring current grain production, temporarily suspended non-flood-fighting water conservancy projects and construction projects; temporarily suspended undertakings that have little relationship with current agricultural production and can be carried out more during the slack season and suspended during the busy season. And adopted measures such as faster progress helping slower progress, and urban areas helping rural areas. Due to these effective measures, the labor force engaged in field production in the county was concentrated, which greatly accelerated the daily progress of inter-tillage and weeding. Dingbian County also took similar measures, transferring 1,200 laborers to field production.

    After 90% of the labor force in the region went to the agricultural front, various localities allocated agricultural work according to their personal strengths. Strong laborers went to the mountains to weed, while women and auxiliary laborers were assigned to weed the second crop of potatoes and pull weeds on the edges of the fields, so that everyone could do their best, and the progress of weeding and topdressing was greatly accelerated. The Miaomao production team of Tongzhen Commune in Mizhi County had weeded each mu of autumn field four times. In order to change the work appearance of backward teams, the Gutasi Commune of Yulin County mobilized advanced teams to help backward teams weed in the form of exchanging labor. In just three days, the grass wasteland of the Liuqianhe team was eliminated.

    In addition, factory workers in various places have further improved their work in supporting agriculture. In addition to sending people to the countryside to support agriculture, the Yulin County Machinery Factory, the workers in the factory tried their best to squeeze out time to repair agricultural machinery. The state-owned Mahe Farm had 65 carts for sending fertilizer that needed to be assembled. After knowing this, the more than 20 employees of the assembly team of this factory used their afternoon rest time to assemble them, and they were all assembled the next morning, ensuring that the farm could fertilize in time.

    Currently, of the more than 12 million mu of autumn fields in the region, 80% have been weeded twice, 40% have been weeded three times, and fertilizer has been generally applied, and some third-class seedlings have been fertilized twice.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 20th. The Jianxing People's Commune in Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, boldly mobilized the masses and tapped labor forces from all aspects through the mass line to strengthen the front line of agricultural production. In the past month, the labor force投入ed in the front line of agriculture in the entire commune has increased to 80%, of which more than 70% are strong laborers. Production in the entire commune has developed rapidly: the planting area of late rice and various late autumn crops has greatly exceeded the same period last year; the progress of field management of various major spring crops has also been accelerated compared with previous years, and the plans for other industries have been overfulfilled.

    The Jianxing Commune Party Committee has always adhered to the method of boldly mobilizing the masses and carrying out mass movements from beginning to end when transferring labor to strengthen the front line. First, the Commune Party Committee conducted in-depth ideological education with agriculture as the foundation among the masses, and widely organized the masses to study and discuss, so that all members of the commune established the idea of everyone for agriculture, everywhere for agriculture, always for agriculture, and all walks of life for agriculture. At the same time, the Commune Party Committee also investigated and summarized the labor arrangement and use of two management areas. The first management area has a total of 279 laborers, while the labor force used for pig raising, cattle feeding, cooking, vegetable growing, and commune-run industry and transportation reached 164 people, and only 115 people directly engaged in field production, accounting for only 41% of the total labor force, so the production progress was slower; the tenth management area, which has similar natural conditions and other conditions as the first management area, has maintained more than 70% of the labor force participating in field labor this year, and the production items are all leading, and the planting plan has been overfulfilled, and the output of small spring grain has increased by more than 30%. The Commune Party Committee conducted extensive publicity and education among the masses through the fact that the labor arrangement and use of the two management areas are different and the results are different. Then, the Commune Party Committee announced the current production situation and labor use account of the entire commune to the masses. It was explained that the labor distribution in the past was not reasonable enough, and requested that all walks of life in the commune rearrange the labor force and concentrate the superior forces on the front line of agricultural production.

    After mobilizing the masses through the above methods, the masses carried out free airing of views and discussions, and put forward many rationalization proposals. The staff of the cotton ginning mill calculated a detailed account based on the cotton production situation. As long as 128 people work for four months, the annual cotton ginning task can be completed, while in the past, the entire factory had 282 people. The second production team of the eighth management area adopted methods such as exchanging weak labor for strong labor and organizing auxiliary labor to participate in production, so that more than 80% of the labor engaged in field production were strong laborers.

    Through the mass movement, this commune dug out 2,200 laborers to strengthen the front line of agricultural production. (Attached picture)

    领导干部深入下去帮助基层合理安排劳力
    榆林专区锄草追肥增添新军
    建兴公社发动群众挖掘劳动力潜力二千多人加强农业第一线
    本报讯　据陕西日报消息：陕西省榆林专区各级领导干部深入农村，帮助县、公社和生产队集中和挖掘劳动力，充实粮食生产战线。目前，从各个方面已调出劳动力二十五万人，连同原有劳动力，全区90％的劳力（计七十五万人）投入了锄草、追肥的战斗，锄草日进度加快了三倍。
    榆林专区今年秋田播种面积比去年扩大很多，加上近月多雨，杂草丛生，因此锄草和追肥需要大量的劳动力。为了作好锄草和追肥的田间管理工作，地委几位领导人带领一批干部分别深入各县、各公社和生产队进行具体调查研究。调查中，发现有些县、公社和生产队的领导干部对集中劳力抓粮食生产的劲头不狠，他们还按往年的劳力规划办事；劳力使用过于分散。地委即在榆林县城郊公社青云山管理区召开了常委扩大会议，具体研究了崔家畔、青云两个生产队的劳力安排情况。如崔家畔队，投入水利、运输、砖瓦厂、公路、食堂等方面的劳力就占总劳力的48.8％，参加田间生产的则占总劳动力的51.2％。由于劳力不足，全队有五百多亩秋田未锄，锄过二遍的只是少数。常委会议认为：从崔家畔的劳力安排情况，可以看出一些同志对国民经济以农业为基础、农业又以粮食为基础的极端重要的意义还没有深刻理解。紧接着地委召开了电话会议，号召各地坚决集中一切可以集中的劳力，加强当前以锄草追肥为中心的田间管理工作。
    各县响应地委的号召，迅速行动起来。榆林县根据水利等农村基本建设必须服从当前农业生产，在保证当前粮食生产的前提下分期分批地进行的原则，暂时停止了非抢险的水利工程和修建工程；对与当前农业生产关系不大，农闲时可以多办，农忙时可以停办的事业暂时停办。并且采取了进度快的帮进度慢的、城市帮农村等措施。由于这些措施得力，集中了全县从事田间生产的劳力，大大加快了中耕除草的日进度。定边县也采取了类似措施，抽调了一千二百名劳动力投入了田间生产。
    全区90％的劳力走上农业战线以后，各地根据他们的个人特长，分配了农活。强壮劳力上山锄草，妇女和辅助劳力分配锄二道洋芋和拔坎边草，作到人尽其能，锄草追肥进度大大加快。米脂县通镇公社庙峁生产队每亩秋田都已锄了四次。榆林县古塔寺公社为了改变后进队的工作面貌，发动先进队以换工形式帮助后进队锄草，仅三天时间，刘千河队的草荒就被消灭了。
    此外，各地工厂职工也进一步作好支援农业的工作。榆林县机械厂除派人下乡支援农业外，在厂的职工尽量挤出时间为农业修配机具。国营马合农场有六十五个送肥用的车子需要装配，这个厂装配组的二十多名职工知道后，利用下午休息时间装配，第二天早上全部装好，保证了农场及时施肥。
    目前，全区一千二百多万亩秋田，有80％锄过二道，40％锄过三道，并普遍追了肥，还有部分三类苗追肥两次。
    新华社成都20日电　四川省南部县建兴人民公社放手发动群众，通过群众路线从各方面挖掘劳动力，加强农业生产第一线。最近一个月中，全社投入农业第一线的劳力已增加到80％，其中70％以上是强劳力。全社生产迅速开展：晚稻和各种晚秋作物的栽种面积大大超过了去年同期；各项大春作物的田间管理进度也比往年加快，其它各行各业计划都超额完成。
    建兴公社党委在抽调劳力加强第一线时自始至终坚持放手发动群众、大搞群众运动的办法。首先，公社党委在群众中深入进行了以农业为基础的思想教育，广泛组织群众学习讨论，使全社社员都树立了人人为农业、处处为农业、时时为农业、各行各业为农业的思想。与此同时，公社党委又调查和总结了两个管理区安排使用劳力的情况。第一管理区共有二百七十九个劳力，而用于养猪、喂牛、煮饭、种菜以及社办工业和运输方面的劳力即达一百六十四人，直接从事田间生产的仅一百一十五人，只占劳力总数的41％，因而生产进度较慢；自然条件等情况与第一管理区差不多的第十管理区，今年一直保持70％以上的劳力参加田间劳动，生产项项领先，栽种计划超额完成，小春粮食增产30％多。公社党委通过这两个管理区安排和使用劳力情况不同因而结果两样的事实，在群众中进行了广泛的宣传教育。接着，公社党委又把当前全社的生产情况和劳力使用账向群众公布。说明过去劳力分配还有不够合理的地方，要求公社各行各业重新安排劳力，把优势兵力集中到农业生产第一线。
    经过以上方法发动群众后，群众中开展了鸣放讨论，提出了许多合理化建议。轧花厂职工根据棉花生产情况算了一笔细账，只要一百二十八人工作四个月就可完成全年的轧花任务，而过去全厂却有二百八十二人。八管理区二生产队采取以弱换强，组织辅助劳力参加生产等办法，使从事田间生产的劳力，80％以上都是强劳力。
    经过群众运动，这个公社挖出了二千二百个劳动力加强农业生产第一线。（附图片）
