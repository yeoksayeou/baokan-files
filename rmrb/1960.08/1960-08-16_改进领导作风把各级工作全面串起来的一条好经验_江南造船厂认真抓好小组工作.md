A Good Experience in Improving Leadership Style to Fully Link Work at All Levels
Jiangnan Shipyard Earnestly Grasps Team Work
(Our Shanghai dispatch, August 15th) How can leading cadres at all levels in factories and mines go deep into the front line of production? What should they grasp when they go deep? And how can they grasp everything comprehensively? Recently, the Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard has begun to find a good experience in improving leadership style and work methods, and in fully linking all tasks – earnestly grasping team work. The cadres of this factory go deep, first of all by putting down their airs, immersing themselves in the team, earnestly participating in team labor, and learning humbly. In the process of labor, they understand and discover specific problems, organize discussions, and thoroughly grasp the situation, then enthusiastically help to solve them; at the same time, they consult with team cadres on work, helping to improve the ideological level and work ability of team leaders. On this basis, they summarize and improve the advanced work experience of many teams, and find the laws. Through cadres going deep into the teams, the Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard has initially explored effective leadership methods of "one labor, two talks, three learning, four helping, and five promoting."

The Party organization of the Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard summarized these common laws of advanced team work into five characteristics and promoted them universally in all teams throughout the factory. These five characteristics are that under the leadership of a strong core composed of the Party group leader (or Party member), the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League team leaders, and some activists, the teams: First, comprehensively grasp ideology. Persist in studying Chairman Mao's works and do a good job in ideological work. Second, comprehensively grasp production. Grasp output, variety, quality, and conservation all together. Plans are implemented to each individual. Third, comprehensively grasp innovation. Fourth, comprehensively grasp management. Ensure everyone has something to do, and everything is taken care of. Fifth, comprehensively grasp life. The emergence of these comprehensive leap forward teams has made leaders at all levels realize that team work is not small, team work is the starting point for carrying out vigorous mass movements, the foothold for doing a solid job in all tasks, the convergence point of various contradictions, and the flowering point of the comprehensive leap forward. Cadres go deep to grasp team work well. In order to make the level of advanced teams the level of all teams in the factory, the factory Party committee promptly convened a factory-wide cadre meeting and a cadre symposium to exchange experiences in going deep to grasp teams and experiences in team work. Each workshop also held on-site meetings at advanced teams, held experience exchange meetings on "How to be a Good Production Team Leader," and organized the masses to "study abroad" and learn from advanced teams. Thus, a new high tide of mass competition, learning, catching up, and helping has been set off among all teams throughout the factory. At present, of the more than 500 production teams in the factory, 125 already possess the five characteristics of advanced teams.

The experience of the Jiangnan Shipyard shows that to do a good job in team work and make the teams possess the above five characteristics, it is first necessary to do a good job in the political and ideological education of the teams and adhere to putting politics in command. Many advanced teams take the study of Chairman Mao's works as the key link in carrying out all their tasks, using Mao Zedong Thought to improve themselves and guide their work. When the Wang Xingyi team was in charge of the water ballast tank pipes of the "Peace No. 72" ship, they encountered difficulties such as the pipes processed by other workshops not keeping up, the lack of key materials, and the crane workers not being available. Through the study of "On Contradiction," they realized the relationship between internal and external causes and decided to try their best to solve the difficulties themselves. When other workshops could not cooperate in processing, they did it themselves; when key materials were insufficient, they found them themselves; when there were no crane workers, they did it themselves, and as a result, they completed the task one day ahead of schedule. Each team not only guided its work through study, but also wrote papers and reflections based on practice to summarize experience. The team's persistence in putting politics in command is also reflected in having a good team democratic life and doing a good job in ideological work. At the team democratic life meeting, the Jin Tianshou team adopted the method of everyone reporting their own strengths and weaknesses in their work to carry out criticism and self-criticism. Persisting in putting politics in command is also reflected in having someone responsible for ideological work in all three shifts, day and night, and correspondingly establishing a "four exchanges" system of exchanging ideology, exchanging learning, exchanging production, and exchanging innovation, so that ideological problems do not stay overnight, and advanced seedlings are spread in time.

The experience of the Jiangnan Shipyard shows that cadres going deep into the teams to help the teams comprehensively improve ideology, production, learning, and life is an important guarantee for realizing the comprehensive leap forward of the entire workshop and the entire factory. And for a team to grasp everything comprehensively, it must fully implement worker participation in team management under the centralized leadership of the team core. The core leadership of the Jin Tianshou team regularly conducts comprehensive analysis and discussion on the ideology, production, and life of the team at each stage, and makes comprehensive arrangements; each core member is assigned to be responsible for several "members" in the team management, providing frequent and specific assistance and leadership; at the same time, it is stipulated that each "member" reports their work to the team every two weeks, conducts commendation and criticism, and studies the next step of work. The team has a total of sixteen people and has established political instructors, planning and dispatchers, quality inspectors, economic accountants, and life and welfare members; among them, some "members," such as quality inspectors, have three people working in accordance with the needs of the three shifts, so that everyone has something to do and everything is taken care of. In this way, not only is there leadership grasping each task, but also the masses are grasping it, allowing the production team leader to get rid of many administrative tasks and concentrate their energy on grasping the team work more comprehensively. Due to the comprehensive arrangements of the team's core leadership and the sound management system of the team, everyone in the team has a clear understanding of the production plan, each team member has their own comprehensive leap forward plan, and a "six comparisons" competition of "comparing ideology, comparing production, comparing technological revolution, comparing the study of Chairman Mao's works, comparing cultural learning, and comparing health, sports, and safety" has also been launched among the team members. Since May, this team has successively realized a production line and more than a dozen technological innovations, improving efficiency by one to fifty times; in May, the entire team achieved the equivalent of one person doing the work of four and a half people, and in June, they achieved the equivalent of one person doing the work of five people, completing the June production task eleven days ahead of schedule.

The comprehensive leap forward of more teams has brought about a comprehensive leap forward to the work sections, workshops, and the entire factory. The entire factory completed the state plan for the first half of the year twenty days ahead of schedule. The fourth work section of the installation workshop has a total of eight teams. In the past, it was rare to complete the plan with a full house of red flags, but after grasping team work vigorously, each team overfulfilled the production plan by 20% to 30% in May and June, achieving a full house of red flags every month and every team; the study of Chairman Mao's works developed from one team to the entire work section; the attendance rate for cultural learning also increased from 30% to more than 80%; the work section also established basketball, table tennis, and tug-of-war teams, as well as self-composed and self-performed singing teams, and even veteran workers practiced Tai Chi and participated in calisthenics.

After the Jiangnan Shipyard vigorously grasped team work, it promoted the improvement of the leadership level and management level of leaders at all levels. For example, after the comprehensive leap forward of team work, the plan arrangements, technical drawings, materials and tools, and quota management from above appeared unable to adapt to the needs of team production work, prompting leaders at all levels to start further improving and strengthening the management at the factory, workshop, and work section levels. Technicians and staff also went down to the teams in conjunction with their work and established some management systems adapted to the comprehensive development of team work. For example, the installation workshop launched technicians and staff to conduct airing views and discussions, widely absorbed the opinions of workers, and made eighteen kinds of process regulations universal and more than ninety kinds of three-part forms (simple construction orders and sketches) standardized; and mobilized the masses to universally discuss and revise the old quotas.

### 改进领导作风把各级工作全面串起来的一条好经验  江南造船厂认真抓好小组工作

    改进领导作风把各级工作全面串起来的一条好经验
    江南造船厂认真抓好小组工作
    本报上海15日电　在厂矿企业，各级领导干部如何深入生产第一线？深入下去抓什么？怎么全面地抓？上海江南造船厂最近一个时期开始找到了一条改进领导作风和工作方法、把各项工作全面串起来的好经验——认真抓好小组工作。这个厂的干部深入下去，首先是放下架子，沉到小组，认真参加小组劳动，虚心学习。在劳动过程中，了解和发现具体问题，组织座谈，深入掌握情况，然后热情地帮助加以解决；同时，与小组干部共同商量工作，帮助提高小组骨干的思想水平和工作能力。在这个基础上，他们把许多小组的先进工作经验，加以总结提高，找出规律。通过干部深入小组，上海江南造船厂初步摸索到“一劳、二谈、三学、四帮、五推”的有效的领导方法。
    上海江南造船厂的党组织把这些先进小组工作的共同规律，归纳成五个特点，在全厂的小组中普遍推广。这五个特点是，小组在以党小组长（或党员）为首的、党政工团小组长和一部分积极分子所组成的坚强核心的领导下，第一、全面抓思想。坚持学习毛主席著作，做好思想工作。第二、全面抓生产。产量、品种、质量、节约一齐抓。计划落实到每个人。第三、全面抓革新。第四、全面抓管理。做到人人有事做，事事有人管。第五、全面抓生活。这些全面跃进小组的出现，使各级领导认识到：小组工作并不小，小组工作是轰轰烈烈大搞群众运动的起点，是扎扎实实搞好各项工作的落脚点，是各种矛盾的集合点，是全面跃进的开花点，干部深入下去就是要抓好小组工作。为了使先进小组的水平成为全厂各小组的水平，厂党委及时召开了全厂干部大会和干部座谈会，交流深入下去抓小组的经验和小组工作的经验。各车间也纷纷在先进小组召开现场会，召开“如何当好生产小组长”的经验交流会，并组织群众到先进小组“留学”、取经。于是，全厂各小组之间掀起了一个群众性的比、学、赶、帮的竞赛新高潮。目前全厂五百多个生产小组中，具备先进小组五个特点的已达一百二十五个。
    江南造船厂的经验表明，搞好小组工作，使小组具备上述五个特点，首先要做好小组的政治思想教育工作，坚持政治挂帅。许多先进小组在开展各项工作中都以学习毛主席著作为纲，用毛泽东思想来提高自己，指导工作。王行义小组在担任“和平七十二号”轮压水仓管子工作时，碰到了其他车间加工的管子跟不上、关键材料不足、起重工没有等困难。他们通过《矛盾论》的学习，认识到内因和外因的关系，就决定尽量自己动手解决困难。其他车间加工配合不上，他们就自己干；关键材料不足，就自己找；没有起重工就自己动手，结果提前一天完成了任务。各小组不仅通过学习指导了工作，而且根据实践写论文、心得，总结经验。小组坚持政治挂帅，还表现在过好小组民主生活，做好思想工作。金天寿小组在小组民主生活会上，采用大家汇报自己工作中的优缺点的方式，来开展批评自我批评。坚持政治挂帅，还表现在日夜三班都有专人负责思想工作，并相应地建立了交思想、交学习、交生产、交革新的“四交”制度，做到思想问题不过夜，先进苗子及时传。
    江南造船厂的经验表明，干部深入小组，帮助小组把思想、生产、学习、生活等全面搞好，是实现全车间、全厂全面跃进的重要保证。而小组要抓好全面，必须在小组核心的集中领导下，充分实行工人参加小组管理。金天寿小组的核心领导，对小组各时期的思想、生产、生活，定期作全面的分析讨论，全面的安排；每个核心人员分工负责小组管理中的几个“员”，进行经常的、具体的帮助和领导；同时规定每个“员”每两周向小组汇报一次工作，进行表扬与批评，研究下一步的工作。小组总共十六人，建立了政治辅导员、计划调度员、质量检查员、经济核算员、生活福利员等；其中有些“员”如质量检查员，按照三班生产的需要，一种“员”有三个人作，做到人人有事做，事事有人管。这样，各项工作不仅有领导抓，而且有群众抓，使生产组长摆脱了许多事务工作，集中精力更全面地抓好小组工作。由于小组的核心领导全面安排，小组管理制度健全，因此小组的生产计划人人有数，每个组员都有个人的全面跃进规划，组员之间还开展了“比思想、比生产、比技术革命、比学习毛主席著作、比文化学习、比卫生体育安全”的六比竞赛。这个小组自5月份以来，先后实现了一条流水线，十几项技术革新，提高效率一倍至五十倍；5月份全组实现了一个人顶四个半人，6月份实现一个人顶五人，提前十一天完成了6月份的生产任务。
    更多小组的全面跃进，给工段、车间、全厂带来了全面跃进。全厂提前二十天完成了上半年国家计划。安装车间的第四工段共有八个组，过去完成计划很少能够满堂红，而在大抓小组工作以后，5、6月份各小组都分别超额20％到30％完成了生产计划，达到月月组组满堂红；学习毛主席著作从原来一个组，发展到全工段；文化学习的出席率也从原来的30％提高到80％以上；工段里还成立了篮球、乒乓球、拔河等代表队，还有自编自演的歌咏队，连老工人也打起太极拳，参加了广播操。
    江南造船厂大抓小组工作以后，促使各级领导干部提高了领导水平和管理水平。如小组工作全面跃进以后，上面的计划安排、技术图纸、材料工具、定额管理等就显得不能适应小组生产工作的需要，促使各级领导着手进一步健全和加强厂、车间、工段各级的管理。技术人员和职员也纷纷结合业务下小组，建立了一些适应小组工作全面发展的管理制度。如安装车间发动技术人员和职员进行鸣放讨论，广泛吸取工人的意见，使车间有十八种工艺规程通用化，九十多种三联单（简单的施工命令和草图）标准化；并且发动群众普遍对旧定额进行了讨论和修改。
