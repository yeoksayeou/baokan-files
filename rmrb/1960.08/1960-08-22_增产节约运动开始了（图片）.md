    The Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign Begins
    Expressing Determination: Workers at the Beijing Lifting Machinery Factory enthusiastically respond to the Party's call to launch the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. Workers in the Mobile Crane Workshop are excitedly writing letters of determination, drafting plans, and proposing measures to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the state plan.
    Detailed Accounting: Workers in the Stamping Group of the Beijing Lifting Machinery Factory are actively conducting economic accounting in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign to further reduce costs.
    Innovation: Workers in the Bridge Crane Workshop of the Beijing Lifting Machinery Factory are learning from the advanced experience of the Dalian Lifting Machinery Factory, using a gantry planer to process double-beam crane bearing housings, increasing efficiency more than five times compared to using a shaper.
    Leaders Go to the Front Lines: Li Baoshu (first from right in the front), Deputy Director of the Beijing Lifting Machinery Factory, goes to the Double-Beam Crane Group to study with workers and technicians how to achieve high-quality and high-yield double-beam cranes.
