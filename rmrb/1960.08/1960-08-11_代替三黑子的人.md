    The Person Who Replaced San Heizi
    Yu Fusheng

    Secretary Li of the commune came to Wangzhuang Production Team to focus on summer planting. The team leader arranged for him to stay at the home of Wang Song, the old livestock tender. As soon as Secretary Li put down his luggage, Grandpa Wang Song rushed in, blurting out, "Tell me, Secretary Li! Why get sick now, why not later, but right at this crucial moment?"
    "Who is it, Grandpa Song?" Secretary Li asked while unpacking.
    "San Heizi!" Old Wang Song took out his pipe, filled it with tobacco, and started puffing away, even forgetting to light the match. "You know, we're in a heated competition with the Chenzhuang Team behind us, everyone is beating their chests, guaranteeing to finish the summer planting in five days. We made a bet yesterday, but San Heizi got sick today, what do you say..."
    "Can't you find someone to replace him?"
    "No way!" Grandpa Wang Song said decisively, "That big black ox that San Heizi uses only listens to him. Besides, everyone in the team is earning their work points diligently, no one has time to spare."
    Secretary Li took out his notebook and wrote something down, then comforted him, "It's okay, Grandpa Song! Difficulties can always be solved. I'll discuss it with the team leader at the meeting tonight."
    After Secretary Li left, Grandpa Wang Song muttered to himself, "Unless I, this old Huang Zhong, go out myself, unless I, this old Huang Zhong, personally go out."
    At night, Grandpa Wang Song went to take care of the cattle shed. He walked to the door and proudly shouted, "Black Ox, Black Ox! Tomorrow, I'll show you who's boss!" Who knew that as soon as he stepped inside, the Black Ox was gone. He was really shocked and rushed to the team leader's house. Unfortunately, the team leader wasn't there. Old Wang Song was so anxious that his teeth chattered. He turned around and rushed to the main road, vowing in his heart, "If I catch you, you cattle thief, I'll beat you half to death!"
    Suddenly, he faintly heard a "gee-haw" sound not far away. He stretched his neck, furrowed his brow, and listened carefully. Then he tiptoed over and, sure enough, saw the shadows of a person and an ox. He couldn't help shouting angrily, "Stop! Who's there?"
    But the answer he received was a burst of laughter, and then he heard a familiar voice say, "Oops, you caught me!"
    "Ah, it's you!" Old Wang Song looked closer and saw that it was Secretary Li. Moreover, not only was the ox there, but the plow was there too.
    "How about it, Grandpa Song! Can I replace San Heizi?" Secretary Li was carrying the plow, gee-hawing the ox towards the village.
    "This..." Old Wang Song really didn't know what to say, and after a long while, he blurted out, "You think there's really no one to replace San Heizi?"
    "Who then?" Secretary Li asked seriously.
    "Old Huang Zhong, me!"
    "Cough cough!" Secretary Li said with a smile:
    "The Black Ox only listens to you feeding it, not to you using it!"
    "Anyway, you can't!" Grandpa Wang Song said stubbornly, "You can't handle this thing!"
    "Don't look down on me, Grandpa Song! Let's wait and see!"
    "No, you have to lead production!" Grandpa Wang Song said, quickly snatching the plow from Secretary Li's shoulder, gee-hawing the Black Ox.
    "Leading production can't be divorced from production!" Secretary Li laughed heartily. "Let's go! Get some rest, and tomorrow you can watch the old soldier go into battle."
    The next day, all ten farming team members of Wangzhuang Production Team went to work, except San Heizi had been replaced. Old Wang Song carried the fodder, pointing to the person driving the Black Ox in the distance, introducing him to the passing commune members, even though everyone knew him.
    "That's Secretary Li from the commune, that's Secretary Li from the commune!"

    代替三黑子的人
    余福生
    公社李书记到王庄生产队来抓夏栽工作，队长把他安顿在老饲养员王松大爷家里住宿。李书记刚把行李放下，王松大爷就急冲冲地踏进门来，没头没脑地说：“你说说看，李书记！早不害病，迟不害病，偏偏在骨节眼儿上害起病来了。”
    “谁呀？松大爷。”李书记一面解开行李，一面问。
    “三黑子！”老王松掏出旱烟管，装上烟，火柴也忘了划，就猛地抽起来了。“你知道，我们同后面陈庄队干得正来火，大家胸膛拍得叮咚响，保证五天完成夏栽。昨天打的擂，偏偏今天三黑子病了，你说……”
    “换一个顶上不行吗？”
    “不行！”王松大爷斩钉截铁地说：“三黑子使的那条大黑牯就只服他，再说队里人人把工分得实实的，腾不出手来。”
    李书记拿出笔记本子来写了些什么，然后安慰说：“不要紧，松大爷！困难总会解决的，晚上开会时我和队长再研究一下吧。”
    李书记走后，松大爷就径自嘀咕着：“除非我这老黄忠亲自出马，除非我这老黄忠亲自出马。”
    夜里，王松大爷去照料牛房，他走到门前，就自豪地喊道：“黑大牯，黑大牯！明天看我来制服你！”谁知他一脚踏进门去，黑大牯却不见了。他这一惊真是非同小可，急忙冲到队长家里。偏巧队长不在，老王松可急坏了，牙齿咬得格格响，回过头来就往大路上赶去，心里发着狠：“逮住你个偷牛的，非揍个半死不可！”
    忽然，在不远的地方隐隐地传来了?喝的声音；他伸长着脖子，紧锁着眉头，仔细地听了一下，便蹑手蹑脚地走过去，果然看到人和牛的影子了。他忍不住怒喊了一声：“站住！是谁？”
    但是，回答他的却是噗哧的笑声，然后才听见一个并不陌生的声音说：“不好，给你发觉了！”
    “啊，是你！”老王松近前一看，原来是李书记，再看，不仅有牛，连犁耙都在这儿。
    “怎么样，松大爷！能顶三黑子用吗？”李书记正扛着犁，?喝着牛向庄上走来。
    “这……”老王松真不知说什么是好，半晌才迸出一句话来：“你以为真没有人顶三黑子吗？”
    “谁呢？”李书记认真地问。
    “老黄忠我呗！”
    “咳咳！”李书记微笑地说：
    “黑大牯只服你喂，可不服你使！”
    “反正你不能！”王松大爷负气似地说：“这玩艺儿你使不起来！”
    “别看不起人哪，松大爷！不信俺们走着瞧吧！”
    “不，你要领导生产！”王松大爷说着连忙从李书记肩上抢下犁，?喝着黑大牯。
    “领导生产可不能脱离生产呀！”李书记爽朗地笑了。“走吧！早点休息去，明天请你看老兵上战场吧。”
    第二天，王庄生产队十个耕作组员，全部上工，只不过三黑子换了人。老王松挑着饲料，指着远远地赶着黑大牯的人，向来往的社员们介绍着，尽管大家都认识。
    “那就是公社里的李书记，那就是公社里的李书记！”
