Gao Likong, a Teacher at Xinliangdi Village Primary School in Yongchang County, Gansu Province, Relies Closely on the Party and the Masses
	Buries Himself in Hard Work and Frugal School Management to Cultivate Agricultural Construction Talents
	Who would have thought: a young man who only studied for two years, relying closely on the Party and the masses, started a primary school from scratch in the "poor stick village" where people used to eat "coarse food for half the year and every household was illiterate." This school has not only never received state subsidies, nor has it ever charged students tuition fees, but it has also gradually achieved self-sufficiency in student food and books and stationery. The graduates of this school not only rank among the best in exams, but also learn some production skills. This young man who runs the school is Communist Party member Gao Likong, and the school he founded is Xinliangdi Minban Primary School in Jinchuan People's Commune, Yongchang County, Gansu Province.
	"We must run a school"
	In 1952, after the land reform, the villagers wanted to start a school for their children to learn to read, but at that time, villages were vigorously building schools, and there were not so many teachers to allocate! Xinliangdi Village could not find a teacher and could not start school. After discussion, everyone set their ambitions and determined to send children to study in other villages to cultivate local "scholars." In this way, Gao Likong, who "often pestered his grandmother to go to school," was sent to Chenjiagou Primary School. At this time, Gao Likong was only sixteen years old!
	Chenjiagou is five miles away from Xinliangdi, with a desert beach in between. Wild wolves, will-o'-the-wisps, and people's absurd legends did make Gao Likong a little scared. However, when he thought that he had asked to go to school many times in the past, but his grandmother always said: "How can we poor people afford to study!" Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, his wish has finally come true; and when he thought of what the villagers said: "Likong, if you study well, our Xinliangdi Village will have a bright-eyed person." These words made him forget all his fears. Since starting school, he has worked hard without interruption, rain or shine. Two years later, he returned with a junior primary school diploma.
	The village had "its own scholar," so people busied themselves with starting a school. The school was finally established, but there was no equipment. At that time, agricultural production had just recovered, the agricultural cooperatives were small in scale, with little funds and no accumulation, so they could not afford to build a school. The masses said that as long as the children can go to school, it's fine. If there is no equipment, we will use poor methods and convert the three dilapidated Guandi Temple into a classroom. Lord Guan and Zhou Cang were carried out, and a group of children sat in the temple. There were more than twenty children in the village who came to study, the oldest being sixteen or seventeen years old, and the youngest only seven years old; there was only one teacher, Gao Likong. After the start of school, Gao Likong led the older children to find broken bricks and rotten clods in the village and piled them up to make desks and benches; found pot ink and brushed it on the wall to make a "blackboard"; carried white soil from fifty miles away and rubbed it into mud sticks to use as chalk; and borrowed a batch of used old textbooks from Chenjiagou Primary School. From then on, the quiet Guandi Temple every day resounded with the children's babbling sounds of reading, adding a new atmosphere to the village.
	In the midst of the pleasant sound of reading, difficulties one by one forced themselves upon the young Gao Likong: The Guandi Temple was too dilapidated, and every time there was a strong wind, the temple walls would shake. Gao Likong was afraid that it would collapse and crush the children, so he had to let the children go outside the temple; outside the temple, he was afraid that the strong wind would blow the children away, so he and the children held each other arm in arm, squatted in a sheltered place, waiting for the wind and sand to pass. At night, Gao Likong had to prepare lessons or correct homework for the students. There was no lamp in the school, and no money to buy oil, so he had to go home to do it. Over time, his mother became unhappy, complaining that he was using oil and wasting lamps at home. However, the greater difficulty was: Gao Likong had no teaching experience at all, and the children did not listen quietly in class, especially some of the older children, who had picked firewood and cut reeds with Gao Likong in the past, and they had no respect for Gao Likong at all. In the classroom, some female students sewed clothes and made shoe soles, and the male students made a lot of noise. Sometimes, they suddenly remembered that they should recognize a new word, and regardless of what Gao Likong was talking about, they shouted loudly: "Gao Likong, look, what word is this?" "Why aren't you listening? Didn't I teach it just now?"
	How can the children be made to be quiet in class and listen to the text? Sometimes he pondered, wanting to give up: "This is not a job for you, you should change careers!" But when he thought of how running a school was related to the interests of so many people, and that he was a Party member, how could he give up halfway? So he strengthened his resolve: "Should we let the school disband? No, absolutely not!"
	Found the magic weapon to overcome difficulties
	Gao Likong went to the Party branch secretary, reported the situation of the school to him, and poured out his grievances. After listening, the branch secretary encouraged him: "The school has been established, this is a good start. How can there be no difficulties in carrying out the revolution? Communists should advance by overcoming all difficulties, otherwise, what do we need you for?" The branch secretary also said: "As long as you rely closely on the masses and make greater achievements yourself to influence the masses, all difficulties will be overcome."
	The secretary's words gave Gao Likong unparalleled confidence and strength, like a clever key opening Gao Likong's mind; like a spark, igniting his youthful enthusiasm. After returning to the village, Gao Likong reported the situation of the school to the masses. After hearing this, the masses automatically donated rafters and purlins, and after finishing their farm work every day, they came to the school to help mix mud, plaster walls, and repair houses. Old carpenter Wang Yuwen even brought his own lamp oil to the school at night to rush to make doors and windows. The young people in the village also donated more than forty yuan in cash. Before long, the school had two simple but solid houses for sheltering from the wind and office use; there were also eighteen brand new desks and benches in the classroom for the children to read and write.
	The enthusiastic help of the masses made Gao Likong even more energetic. In order to win more concern from the masses for the school, he often took homework books to visit the students' families. He showed the characters written by the children to the parents, and read the compositions to the parents; whoever asked Gao Likong to write a letter, he would take the child from that family to write it in person; when the villagers liked to paste couplets during festivals, he would lead the students, bring pen and ink, and write them from house to house. When the masses saw that their children had learned so many "skills" in school, they were all smiles. They gave a thumbs up and praised: "This yellow-haired kid Gao Likong is an unexpected carpenter building a building." They became more and more supportive of the school and loved Gao Likong more and more. There were more and more children going to school.
	Once, Gao Likong was correcting homework, and his mother complained again that he was "using oil and wasting lamps." He said calmly: "Mom, have you forgotten the life of begging from door to door in the past? At that time, we were hungry and cold, and who pitied us? Now that we have the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we don't lack food or clothing. I teach, and I am doing good things for the people. Mom, we can't forget the thousand years of hunger after we are full." Before Gao Likong could finish speaking, his mother was already in tears. She said: "Child, don't mention the past hardships anymore." She turned up the lamp for her son and said: "You correct your books, from now on, I will never complain about you again!"
	A teacher and a student
	Gao Likong thought that the masses were so actively sending their children and supporting the school so enthusiastically, hoping that the children would learn more knowledge in school, but he himself knew too little. To live up to the expectations of the Party and the masses, he must quickly improve his skills. A teacher in Chenjiagou introduced him to a "Selected Readings in Language," saying that it was very helpful for improving language teaching. So he asked someone to buy it from the bookstore in Wuwei County, more than two hundred miles away. However, he did not recognize more than half of the words in this book, and he could not understand the meaning. He became a little discouraged as he read. But when he thought of the branch secretary's words "Communists should advance by overcoming all difficulties," it was as if a light had lit up in front of him, and he felt that the only way out was to bury himself in hard work and learn with humility. From then on, he circled the new words in the book with a red pen, and at night, he crossed the desert beach to go to Chenjiagou Primary School to ask the teachers there to teach him, and then ran home from Chenjiagou in the middle of the night to review by lamplight. Sometimes, many of the words he learned that night were forgotten when he reviewed them, so he circled them again with a blue pen and went to learn them again the next night. One day, two days... many nights passed like this, and Gao Likong couldn't wait to learn it all at once. Due to insufficient rest, his face became thin and his hair was falling out. His mother advised him to rest, but he said: "Mom, if I don't learn, I can't teach the students well, how can I do that?"
	Every time the school district held a teaching experience exchange forum, Gao Likong would represent Xinliangdi Minban School to participate. There, when he learned useful experience from the speeches of the old teachers, he smiled contentedly like a child.
	Learn, learn, and learn again, Gao Likong, like when he was a child, often went to Chenjiagou to study regardless of wind or rain. One night, when he returned home, it was already two o'clock in the morning. He encountered a sudden, senseless wind halfway. The wind rolled up the flying sand, howling, and everything around became even darker. Gao Likong quickly lay down next to a sand dune beside him, wanting to wait for the wind to stop before continuing on his way, but he waited for a long, long time, and the wind was still blowing non-stop. At this time, he suddenly thought, what if the strong wind blows down the dilapidated temple walls and crushes the children before dawn? Thinking of this, his heart could no longer be at ease. He suddenly stood up from the ground, put his clothes on top of his head, and relying on his memory, aimed in the right direction and walked towards the school, braving the pervasive wind and sand. When he arrived at the school, the wind had stopped and it was also dawn. He saw that the "classroom" was safe and sound, and the children had not yet arrived at school, and the stone that had been weighing on his heart finally landed. He patted the sand off his body, and after the children arrived, he stood in front of the blackboard as usual and lectured the children.
	Gao Likong's spirit of hard study deeply moved the children. They no longer made noise in class. Even after class, they all knew to study hard. The children often said: "Why not study hard? Teacher Gao doesn't sleep well or eat well in order to teach us well. If we don't study hard, how can we be worthy of him!"
	Take the path of part-work and part-study
	Xinliangdi was originally a "poor stick" village. Although people's lives had improved greatly after several years of liberation, it was still not easy for many families to afford to send their children to school. Some families sent their children to school, but could not afford the money to buy books and ink. There were also families who often called their children back from school to participate in labor. Gao Likong thought, how can we reduce the burden on parents, solve school funding, and consolidate the school? The Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor" pointed out a bright path for him. At first, he used his spare time to lead the older students to collect wild plants and medicinal materials on the wasteland, and then used these things to exchange for brand new textbooks, notebooks, pencils, and writing brushes, as well as basketballs and volleyballs, and distributed them to the children. The children were overjoyed to receive these things! They painted and wrote all day long, and jumped and bounced in the open space in front of the temple, holding the newly bought balls. Gao Likong asked: "Students, how did we get these things?"
	The children replied in unison:
	"Earned by labor!"
	"Can we solve our own learning expenses without relying on our parents!"
	"Yes, Teacher Gao, we will do whatever you say!"
	Later, in his spare time, Gao Likong often took the children to cut reeds and dig medicinal materials, and sold these things to the supply and marketing cooperative. In this way, the pocket money for learning was gradually solved. At this time, most of the parents saw that their children did not need to take money from home to go to school, and they had developed a habit of loving labor, so they actively supported Gao Likong in leading the students to engage in part-work and part-study. They also suggested to Gao Likong: "Our children are all around twelve or thirteen years old, and they are half of a labor force at home. It would be great if the school could plant some crops and increase the school's income!" However, some parents worriedly said: "If the children also work at school, can they study well?"
	Gao Likong carefully considered the opinions of the masses. He felt that the method of organizing students to grow crops in their spare time was very good, but to do a good job in part-work and part-study, it was necessary to arrange the time for study, labor, and rest well. In the spring of 1957, in order to solve this problem, Gao Likong repeatedly discussed with the students and established a system to ensure that "study, labor, and rest" were not neglected. They stipulated that children under the age of twelve generally do not participate in field labor; those over the age of twelve, under normal circumstances, have four classes in the morning, rest for two hours at noon, have two classes in the afternoon, and then participate in one to two hours of labor, and the time after dinner is free time and self-study time. Then, Gao Likong took the children to reclaim eight acres of land on the nearby wasteland. When sowing, they asked old farmers to guide them, and the children followed them to learn; the agricultural knowledge learned from books was practiced in the fields. In this way, the field became another classroom. After the harvest this year, the school's income increased, and the subsidies for students also increased. Most of the older children generally learned farming skills.
	The success of the first year gave Gao Likong more confidence. He further realized that part-work and part-study is not only a matter of solving funding, but more importantly, it cultivates the students' labor viewpoint and enables students to learn production skills. In 1958, the land sown by the school had a greater development. Especially after the people's commune was established, the commune strongly supported Gao Likong's part-work and part-study plan, allocated a part of the cultivated land to the school as a farm, transferred labor to help the school build school buildings, and helped the school build a greenhouse to cultivate vegetables in the freezing days and supply them to nearby canteens. As a result, the school's economic situation has undergone significant changes. This year, each student received a set of clothes. Since 1959, the income from part-work and part-study has not only completely solved the students' tuition fees and the teachers' salaries, but also enabled all teachers and students to achieve self-sufficiency in food. In winter, each person can also get a set of clothes, and more than 90% of the students have learned more than one kind of production technology, and some have even learned to master new agricultural machinery. The villagers said: "This kind of school that does not require the state to spend money, does not require parents to pay tuition fees, and also cultivates children who are both literate and martial is exactly what we want." Even those who were originally skeptical had to admit defeat and admit: "The Communist Party's methods are good!"
	A red flag of starting from scratch
	Thanks to the support of the Party, the help of the masses, and the hard work of Gao Likong and the diligent labor of the students, Xinliangdi Primary School has grown and strengthened on the basis of overcoming various difficulties. From then on, Gao Likong's reputation for starting from scratch and running the school frugally spread far and wide. Many people came to visit this school. Everyone who has visited Xinliangdi Primary School praised Gao Likong's hard-working style, praised the children's ambition to study and work at the same time, and praised the spirit of the people of Xinliangdi to work hard, strive for self-improvement, and start from scratch.
	However, some people used to worry "Are the students taught by such schools of good quality?" The fact is: Now, all 170 students in the school have an average of one newspaper or magazine, and the school's children's books are always in short supply. Fifth-grade student Li Lanying read more than 50 extracurricular books such as "How Steel Was Tempered" and "Prison Memoirs" last year alone. What about the students' grades? The following is the best answer: In 1959, after two unified tests set by the school district and the county, the students of Xinliangdi School achieved excellent results and ranked first in the school district and the entire county. Last year, out of the sixteen students who graduated from junior primary school, twelve continued to study in senior primary school. Four participated in work. Among these four students, one was rated as an outstanding worker and an outstanding member of the Communist Youth League, one was rated as a red banner bearer; one worked as a boiler operator in the commune, and one worked as a tractor driver in the commune, and both were outstanding workers. The children of this school study well, work well, and are healthy. Parents often write big-character posters or give verbal praise to the school.
	In the past five years, Xinliangdi Minban Primary School has changed from a junior primary school to a senior primary school, and the school building has been transformed from a dilapidated temple into five brand new classrooms and an office. The number of teachers has increased from one to five, and the number of students has increased from more than twenty to more than one hundred and seventy. Xinliangdi Village, which used to be "every household illiterate," has also become a cultural village where "the sound of reading can be heard in every courtyard." Teacher Gao Likong is now the principal of Xinliangdi Primary School. He has been rated as an advanced worker twelve times, attended the provincial, special, and county advanced worker and labor model representative conferences five times, and received awards from the Party and the state seven times. This year, he was also selected as a representative of Gansu Province to participate in the National Conference of Cultural and Educational Heroes.
	How short is five years, and how huge are the changes in Xinliangdi Village. Xinliangdi Minban Primary School is like a red flag, flying on the cultural and educational front.

    甘肃永昌县新粮地村小学教师高立孔紧紧依靠党和群众
    埋头苦干勤俭办学培养农业建设人才
    谁会想到：一个只读过两年书的青年，紧紧依靠党和群众，在过去“糠菜半年粮、户户皆文盲”的“穷棒子村”，白手起家，办起了一所小学。这个学校不但从未领过国家的补助，从未收过学生的学费，它还逐步实现了学生吃粮和书籍文具自给。这个学校的毕业生，不仅考试名列前茅，并且个个学会了一些生产技术。这个办学校的青年就是共产党员高立孔，办起的这个学校就是甘肃省永昌县金川人民公社新粮地民办小学。
    “一定要办学校”
    1952年，经过了土地改革，村里人想办个学校叫孩子们读书识字，可是当时村村都在大办学校，哪有那么多的教师来分配呢！新粮地村请不到教师，开不了学，众人一商量，树雄心，立大志，决定选派孩子去别村学习，培养本地的“秀才”。就这样，“经常向奶奶闹着要念书”的高立孔，被派到陈家沟小学去读书了。这时，高立孔才十六岁呢！
    陈家沟距新粮地有五里，中间是一片荒漠的沙滩，野狼、磷火和人们荒诞的传说，确曾使高立孔有些害怕。可是，他一想到自己过去多次要求上学，而奶奶总是说：“咱穷人怎能念得起书呀！”现在，在共产党的领导下，自己的愿望终于实现了；再想到乡亲们说的：“立孔，你把书念下了，咱们新粮地村可就有了明眼人”。这些话使他把一切恐惧都忘了。自上学后，他风里来，雨里去，从没间断地辛勤学习。两年后，他带着初小毕业证书回来了。
    村里有了“自己的秀才”，人们就张罗着开办学校。学校终于办起来了，啥设备也没有。当时农村生产刚刚恢复，农业社规模小、资金少，又没积累，抽不出钱来盖学校。群众说，孩子们只要能上学就行，没设备咱们用穷办法，把那三间破烂的关帝庙改作教室吧。关老爷、周仓被抬出去了，庙里坐上了一群孩子。村里来念书的孩子有二十多个，最大的十六、七岁，最小的才七岁；教师只有高立孔一人。开学后，高立孔就领着年纪大的孩子，从村里找寻破砖、烂土块，搬来垒成桌凳；找来锅墨，在墙上刷成“黑板”；从五十里路外背来白土，搓成泥棒当粉笔；从陈家沟小学借来一批用过的旧课本。从此，冷冷清清的关帝庙里，每天传出孩子们咿咿呀呀的读书声，给村里增添了一种新的气象。
    在愉快的读书声中，困难一个个地向年轻的高立孔逼来了：关帝庙太破烂了，每遇大风天，庙墙就刮得直动弹。高立孔怕它塌下来砸了孩子们，只得让孩子们到庙外去；到庙外，又怕大风把孩子们刮散，他就和孩子们一起，彼此臂挽着臂，蹲在避风的地方，等待风沙过去。夜晚，高立孔要给学生备课或改作业，学校里没有灯，也没钱打油，他只得回家去做。时间长了，妈妈就不乐意，嫌他在家里熬油费灯。然而更大的困难是：高立孔没有一点教书的经验，孩子们上课又不安静地听讲，尤其是一些大孩子，过去和高立孔一起拣过柴，割过芨芨，他们对高立孔毫不尊敬。在课堂上，有些女学生缝衣服、纳鞋底，男学生大吵大闹。有时，他们突然想起该识个生字了，也不管高立孔在讲什么，就大声嚷叫：“高立孔，你看，这是个啥字？”“你怎么不听呢，刚才我不是教过了吗？”
    如何才能使孩子们在上课的时候安静下来，把课文听下去呢？他有时胡思乱想，想打退堂鼓：“这碗饭不是你吃的，还是改行吧！”但是他一想到办学校关系到多少人的利益，自己是个党员，怎能半途而废呢？于是他又坚定了决心：“难道让学校散伙吗？不行，绝对不行！”
    找到了克服困难的法宝
    高立孔去找党支部书记，给他汇报了学校的情况，倾吐了自己的苦衷。支部书记听后，鼓励他说：“学校办起来了，这是个良好的开始。干革命，怎能没困难呢？共产党员应该在排除万难中前进，不然，还要我们干什么呢？”支部书记又说：“只要你紧紧依靠群众，并且自己努力做出更大的成绩，影响群众，一切困难，都会被克服的。”
    书记的话，给了高立孔无比的信心和力量，像一把巧妙的钥匙打开了高立孔的思路；像火种，燃起了他青春的热情。高立孔回村后，就向群众汇报学校的情况。群众听了，就自动捐出椽子、檁子，每天做完农活后，又到学校来帮助和泥、抹墙、修房子。老木工王玉文，晚上还自带着灯油，到学校来赶做门窗。村里的青年们，还捐出了四十多元现款。没过多久，学校已有了两间虽然简陋但却严实的房子，可供避风和办公用；教室里也有了十八套崭新的桌凳，供孩子们读书写字。
    群众的热情帮助，使高立孔劲头更足了。他为了争取群众更多地关心学校，就经常带着作业本去访问学生的家庭，他把孩子们写的字拿给家长们看，把作文读给家长们听；谁家来请高立孔写信，他就领着谁家的孩子去当面写；村里人逢年过节喜欢贴对联，他就领着学生们，带上笔砚，一家家去写。群众看到自家的孩子在学校学了这么多“本事”，一个个眉开眼笑。翘起拇指连声称赞：“高立孔这黄毛娃子，是看不出的木匠修楼哩。”他们越加对学校支持，对高立孔爱戴。上学的孩子，也越来越多了。
    有次，高立孔正在批改作业，妈妈又嫌他“熬油费灯”，他心平气和地说：“妈，你忘了从前领我沿门讨饭的生活，那时挨饿受冻，有谁怜惜过？如今有了共产党、毛主席，咱们不缺吃、不少穿，我教书，也是给人民办好事。妈，咱们可不能一饱忘了千年饥”。高立孔还没有说完，妈妈已是热泪盈眶，她说：“娃呀，快不要再提过去的辛酸事了。”她把灯给儿子拨亮说：“你改你的本子吧，从今向后，我再也不数说你了！”
    是先生也是学生
    高立孔想，群众这样积极地把孩子送来，又这样热情地支持学校，是希望孩子们在学校里学得更多的知识，可是自己呢，知道的东西太少了。要不辜负党和群众的期望，自己必须迅速提高业务。陈家沟一位教师给他介绍说：“有部‘语文选读’对提高语文教学很有帮助。”他就托人从二百多里外的武威县书店买了来读。可是，这部书上多一半的字他都不认得，意思也看不懂。他看着看着，有些泄气了。但他一想到支部书记说的“共产党员应该在排除万难中前进”的话，眼前就仿佛亮了起来，他觉得只有埋头苦干，虚心学习，才是出路。从此他把书上的生字用红笔圈起来，夜晚，穿过荒漠的沙滩，去陈家沟小学请那里的教师给他教，半夜又从陈家沟跑回家点着灯复习。有时，当夜认会了的字，到复习时又忘记了很多，他再用蓝笔划上圈圈，第二天夜里再去学习。一天，两天，……多少个夜晚这样过去了，高立孔巴不得一下都把它学好。由于休息不足，他脸庞瘦了，头发在脱落。妈妈劝他休息，他说：“妈，不学，教不好学生，怎能行呀？”
    每次学区举行教学经验交流座谈会时，高立孔都代表新粮地民办学校去参加。在那里，他从老教师的发言中学到了有用的经验时，他像孩子似的满意地笑了。
    学习、学习、再学习，高立孔像小时读书一样，经常风雨无阻地到陈家沟去学习。一天晚上，他回家时，已是夜里两点钟了。他走到半路，遇上了没头没脑的大风。风卷着飞沙，呜呜地吼叫，顿时四处显得更加漆黑。高立孔急忙伏在身边的一个沙丘旁，想等风住了再赶路，可是，等了很久很久，风还是刮个不停。这时，他忽然想起，要是等到天亮了大风刮倒了破庙墙，把孩子们压坏了怎么办？想到这里，他的心再也安定不下来了。他霍地从地上站起来，把衣服往头上一顶，就凭着自己的记忆，对准方向，冒着弥漫的风沙，朝学校走去。到学校的时候，风停了，天也亮了，他看见“教室”安然无恙，孩子们也还没有到学校来，一颗悬着的心这才落了地。他拍了拍身上的沙土，等孩子们到齐后，就照常站在黑板前，为孩子们讲课。
    高立孔的刻苦学习的精神，深深地感动了孩子们。他们在课堂上，再也不胡打乱闹了。就是下课以后，他们也都知道认真读书。孩子们时常这样说：“为什么不好好读书呢？高老师为了教好咱们，自己睡不好，吃不好，咱们再不好好地学习，怎能对得起他呢！”
    走勤工俭学的道路
    新粮地原是个“穷棒子”村，虽然解放几年，人们生活有了很大改善，可是供孩子上学，对于不少人家来说，还是不大容易的事。有的人家把孩子送进了学校，却拿不出买书、买笔墨的钱来。还有的人家常常把孩子从学校叫回去参加劳动。高立孔想，怎样才能减轻家长负担，解决学校经费，巩固学校？党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，给他指出了光明的大道。起初，他利用课余时间，领着那些年龄大的学生，到荒滩上去采集野生植物和药材，然后用这些东西换回崭新的课本、笔记本、铅笔、毛笔，还有篮球、排球，发给孩子们。孩子们得到这些东西，乐得不知怎样才好！他们整天画呀，写呀，抱着那新买的球，在庙前的空场子里跳呀蹦呀。高立孔问：“同学们，我们这些东西是怎样得来的？”
    孩子们齐声地答道：
    “劳动挣来的！”
    “咱们不靠父兄供给，自己解决学习费行不行！”
    “行，高老师，你说干啥咱们就干啥！”
    以后，在空闲的时间里，高立孔就经常带着孩子去割芨芨、挖药材，把这些东西卖给供销社，这样一来，学习上的零用钱逐步解决了。这时，大多数家长看到自己的孩子上学不要家里拿钱，并且养成爱劳动的习惯，就积极支持高立孔领着学生搞勤工俭学，他们并向高立孔建议说：“咱们的娃娃年龄都在十二、三岁上下，在家也是个半劳动力，学校要是种些庄稼，使学校再多增加些收入，那才好哩！”可是，也有的家长耽心地说：“娃娃们在学校还劳动，能不能念好书呢？”
    高立孔仔细地考虑了群众的意见，他觉得组织学生在课余种庄稼的办法很好，可是要搞好勤工俭学，就要安排好学习、劳动、休息的时间。1957年春上，为了解决这个问题，高立孔经过和学生们反复商量，订立了一个保证“学习、劳动、休息”三不误的制度，他们规定：十二岁以下的儿童，一般不参加田间劳动；十二岁以上的，在通常情况下，每天上午上四节课，中午休息两个钟头，下午上两节课，然后参加一至二小时的劳动，晚饭后是自由活动和自修时间。接着，高立孔带着孩子在附近的荒滩上，开垦了八亩地。播种的时候，请老农作指导，孩子们跟着学；书本上学到的农业知识，就到田间来实习。这样一来，田间变成了另一个课堂。这年收获后，学校的收入增加了，对学生的补贴也增多了，大孩子普遍学会了种地技术。
    第一年的成功，使高立孔信心更足了，他进一步认识到，勤工俭学不仅是解决经费的问题，更重要的是培养了学生的劳动观点，使学生学会了生产技术。1958年，学校播种的土地有了更大发展，特别是人民公社化后，公社大力支持高立孔勤工俭学的计划，拨出了一部分耕地给学校当农场，抽调劳动力帮助学校建校舍，并帮助学校建起了一幢温室，在滴水成冰的日子里栽培蔬菜，供应附近的食堂。这一来，学校的经济情况有了显著的变化，这年学生们每人得到了一套衣服。从1959年起，勤工俭学的收入，不仅全部解决了学生的学费，解决了教师的工资，并且使全校师生实现了吃粮自给自足，冬天，每人还能得到一套衣服，有90％以上的学生，学会一种以上的生产技术，有的还学会掌握新的农业机具。村里人说：“这种不要国家出钱，不要家长交学费，又把孩子培养得能文能武的学堂，才正合我们的心意。”就是那些原来持怀疑态度的人，也不得不服输，承认：“共产党的办法就是好！”
    白手起家的一面红旗
    由于党的支持，群众的帮助，经过高立孔艰苦奋斗，学生勤恳的劳动，新粮地小学在战胜种种困难的基础上成长壮大起来。从此，新粮地的高立孔白手起家勤俭办学的名声传向远方了。周围有不少的人都跑来参观这所学校。凡是参观过新粮地小学的人们，莫不赞扬高立孔埋头苦干的作风，赞扬孩子们一面学习，一面劳动的志气，赞扬新粮地人民发奋图强、白手起家的精神。
    但是，也曾经有人耽心“这样的学校教出来的学生，是不是质量很好？”事实是：现在，全校一百七十多名学生，几乎每人平均有一份报纸或杂志，学校的儿童读物，总是供不应求。五年级学生李兰英，去年一年就读了“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“狱中纪实”等五十多本课外读物。学生的成绩到底怎样呢？下面就是最好的回答：1959年，经过学区和县上两次统一命题的测验，新粮地学校学生成绩都达到优秀，在学区和全县都是第一。去年，初小毕业的十六名学生中，有十二名继续在高小读书。有四名参加了工作。这四名学生在工作中一个被评为优秀工作者和优秀团员，一个被评为红旗手；一个在本社当锅驼机手，一个在本社当拖拉机手，都是优秀的工作者。这个学校的孩子们学习好、劳动好、身体好，家长经常给学校写大字报或口头表扬。
    五年来，新粮地民办小学，由初小变成高小，校舍由一座破庙改建成五座崭新的教室和一座办公室，教师由一人增加到五人，学生由二十多人增加到一百七十多人。“户户皆文盲”的新粮地村，也变成了“家家院内读书声”的文化村。教师高立孔，现在是新粮地小学的校长，他曾先后十二次被评为先进工作者，五次出席了省、专、县的先进工作者和劳动模范代表会，七次获得党和国家的奖励。今年，又被选为甘肃省的代表，参加了全国文教群英会。
    五年的时间何等短暂啊，而新粮地村的变化多么巨大。新粮地民办小学，像一面红旗，飘扬在文教战线上。
