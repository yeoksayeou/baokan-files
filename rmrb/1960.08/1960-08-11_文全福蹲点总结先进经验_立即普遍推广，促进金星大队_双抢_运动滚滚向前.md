    Wen Quanfu Sums Up Advanced Experience from Staying at a Point
    Immediately Promotes it Universally, Promoting the "Double抢" Movement in the Jinxing Brigade to Roll Forward.
    (Our Dispatch) Will leading cadres going deep into the front line of production, and going deep into a point, affect understanding of the overall situation and guidance of overall work? The fact that Wen Quanfu, the Party Branch Secretary of the Jinxing Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Huichang County, Jiangxi, went deep into the front line and went deep into a point during the leadership of this summer harvest and summer planting, and guided the overall situation, fully proves that only by realistically leading production in production and contacting the masses among the masses can we better create and summarize experience and guide the overall situation.
    In order to better achieve the combination of point and area and using a point to lead an area in leading the "Double抢", the brigade's Party branch selected the Wannian Team, which has always had a good work foundation, as the focus. Branch Secretary Wen Quanfu personally took charge, leading the team cadres and members to eat, live, work, and discuss together. When formulating labor quotas for the "Double抢", some advocated cutting 800 jin of rice per day, some advocated 1,000 jin, and some advocated 2,000 jin. How much is appropriate? It was difficult to estimate. On the basis of listening to the opinions of the masses, Comrade Wen Quanfu personally led several members to conduct experiments, and as a result, a basic standard of 1,500 jin was set for the quota. The Party branch formulated specific labor quotas based on this basic standard, combined with the different conditions of various types of paddy fields. However, in the first two or three days of harvesting, except for the Wannian Team, which basically completed the quota, the other teams in the brigade did not complete it. At this time, some members said that "the quota is too high." Comrade Wen Quanfu was thinking in his mind: If the quota is too high, why did the Wannian Team basically complete it? There must be something to it. Therefore, he immediately convened a field meeting of cadres above the level of team leader from the entire brigade to the Wannian Team. The method of the meeting was different from the past. All attendees and the members of the Wannian Team were together, harvesting and discussing at the same time: Why can the Wannian Team complete the quota, but other teams cannot? After detailed research by the cadres and members, four experiences were summarized: (1) The Wannian Team did a good job in political and ideological work in the labor competition, and the members clearly understood the significance of the "Double抢" and were full of enthusiasm. (2) The Wannian Team conscientiously implemented the labor quota, while other teams also announced the labor quota, but did not conscientiously implement it. (3) The Wannian Team paid more attention to the lives of the members, while other teams were worse. For example, the Wannian canteen delivered boiled water to the fields, but other teams did not, and members went home to drink water when they were thirsty, wasting manpower and time. (4) The Wannian Team had better technological innovations, especially the widespread promotion of rapid harvesting tools, while other teams were still using the old methods.
    After the cadres of each team took these four experiences back, they immediately launched a new high tide of competition to "learn from Wannian, catch up with Wannian, and surpass Wannian." The harvesting progress of the entire brigade accelerated by nearly doubled.
    In order to frequently understand the situation of the area, Comrade Wen Quanfu also devoted two hours every afternoon to inspect the area while going deep into the key points. In the evening, the cadres of each team held a meeting at the agreed place, so that they could grasp the overall situation, discover problems, and solve problems and plan the next day's work through collective research. One day, when Comrade Wen Quanfu went to various teams to inspect the work, he found that some unmatured early rice and some late rice seedlings in the Banao Team had been damaged by drought, but the team leader was still unaware of this situation. The reason was that he was only guarding one group, burying himself in labor, and losing sight of the whole. In addition to immediately helping him to understand the relationship between participating in production and leading production, Comrade Wen Quanfu also studied and exchanged methods of combining point and area at the meeting, and decided that the team leader would spend two hours every afternoon inspecting the area to grasp the overall situation.

    文全福蹲点总结先进经验
    立即普遍推广，促进金星大队“双抢”运动滚滚向前
    本报讯　领导干部深入生产第一线，深入一点，会不会影响对全面情况的了解和对全面工作的指导？江西会昌县城关公社金星大队党支部书记文全福，在领导这次夏收夏种中，深入第一线，深入一点，指导全面的事实，充分证明：只有踏踏实实地到生产中领导生产，在群众中联系群众，才能更好地创造经验和总结经验，指导全面。
    为了在领导“双抢”中更好地做到以点带面，点面结合，这个大队的党支部选择了工作基础一向较好的万年小队为重点，由支部书记文全福同志亲自挂帅，领导小队干部和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。在制订“双抢”劳动定额时，有的主张每天割谷八百斤，有的主张一千斤，也有的主张二千斤。究竟多少才合适呢？难于估断。文全福同志在倾听群众意见的基础上，亲自带领几个社员搞试验，结果定出了一千五百斤的定额基本标准。党支部根据这个基本标准，结合各类稻田的不同情况，制订了具体的劳动定额。可是收割开头的两三天，全大队五个小队中，除了万年小队基本上完成了定额以外，其他各队都没有完成。这时，有些社员说“定额太高了”。文全福同志心中却盘算着：定额太高了，为什么万年小队又基本上完成了定额呢？其中必有文章。于是他立即召集全大队小队长以上的干部到万年小队来开现场会。开会的方法和过去不同，全体到会人员与万年小队的社员在一块儿，一边收割一边讨论：为什么万年小队能完成定额，其他小队却不能完成？经干部和社员详细研究结果，总结了四条经验：（1）万年小队在劳动竞赛中，政治思想工作做得好，社员对“双抢”的意义了解清楚，干劲十足。（2）万年小队认真执行了劳动定额，其他小队虽然也公布了劳动定额，但没有认真执行。（3）万年小队对社员生活抓得较好，其他小队却较差。如万年食堂把开水送到田，其他队却没有，社员口渴了就回家去喝水，浪费人工、时间。（4）万年小队的技术革新较好，特别是普遍推行快速收割器，别的小队还是老一套。
    各队干部带着这四条经验回去以后，立即发动社员掀起了一个“学万年、赶万年、超万年”的竞赛新高潮。全大队的收割进度加快了近一倍。
    为了经常了解面的情况，文全福同志在深入重点的同时，每天下午还抽出两个钟头跑圈检查，傍晚，各队干部在约定的地点开碰头会，这样既能掌握全面情况，发现问题，又能通过集体研究解决问题和计划第二天的工作。有一天，文全福同志深入各队检查工作时，发现坝脑小队有部分未成熟的早稻和部分晚稻秧苗被旱伤了，但小队长还不知道这一情况。原因是他只孤守一组，埋头劳动，顾此失彼。文全福同志除立即帮助他认清参加生产和领导生产的关系外，并且在碰头会上研究、交流了点面结合的方法，决定小队长每天下午抽出两个钟头的时间跑圈检查，掌握全面。
