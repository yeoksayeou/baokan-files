    抒情 of "August 1st. Museum"	Shi Lin
        Straw Sandals

    The thousands of roads spread out before us,
    All were forged by these straw sandals;
    From Jinggang Mountain to the Eighth Plenary Session of the Lushan Conference,
    Ah, China, how many snow-capped mountains and grasslands have you traversed?!
    Straw sandals, teach us to remember the years of hardship;
    Straw sandals, teach us to recall the harsh battles?
    Straw sandals, inspire us to live frugally and tenaciously,
    Embarking on the 25,000-mile journey to the avenue of communism...
        Stone Printing Press

    Back then, it rotated in the Jiangnan base area,
    Before dawn, red proclamations flew onto the walls everywhere.
    Now, in the towering mountains that once guarded it,
    A dam across the river stands tall...
    The water turbine spins tirelessly according to its will,
    Turning each red proclamation into powerful currents of electricity...
    Stone printing press, today proudly declares to the world:
    Behold, China is striding towards industrialization with broad steps...
    *The dam across the river refers to the Shangyou River Hydroelectric Power Station, in Jiangnan.
        Stone Mine

    In the terrifying years, "grass burned over, stones run over with knives,"
    Stone mines guarded the canyons and mountain roads with full of anger,
    As long as the butcher knife dared to touch it, it would suddenly explode,
    Casting the corpses of many White bandits into the ravines...
    According to the ideals of that time, paving the happy road of communism,
    Erecting milestone after milestone, shining in the sunlight.
    Every milestone is transformed from a stone mine,
    With inviolable majesty, warning prying eyes:
    Beware, no knives are allowed here!

    “八一馆”抒情	石麟
      草　鞋
    铺在面前的千百条道路，
    都是这草鞋走出来的；
    从井冈山走到庐山八中全会，
    啊，中国，你跋涉了多少雪山、草地？！
    草鞋，教我们把苦难的岁月牢记；
    草鞋，教我们把严酷的战斗追忆？
    草鞋，激励我们俭朴而又顽强地生活，
    踏上共产主义大道的二万五千里……
        石印机
    当年，它旋转在赣南根据地，
    黎明之前，红色文告飞上各地的墙壁。
    如今，在曾护卫它的丛山峻岭里，
    一座拦河大坝已巍然矗立……
    水轮机按照它的意志飞旋不息，
    张张红色的文告化成股股强大的电力……
    石印机啊，今天骄傲地向全世界宣布：
    请看，中国正向工业化迈开了宽阔的步履……
    ＊拦河大坝指上犹江水力发电站，在赣南。
        石头雷
    恐怖的年代，“茅草过火，石头过刀”，
    石头雷满腔愤怒守卫着峡谷、山道，
    只要屠刀胆敢碰一碰，它便突然爆炸，
    把多少白匪的尸骸抛进了山坳……
    按照当年的理想，铺筑共产主义幸福大道，
    竖起一座座里程碑，在阳光下闪耀。
    每座里程碑都是石头雷化成的，
    威严不可侵犯，正告觊觎的眼睛：
    当心，这里不许动刀！
