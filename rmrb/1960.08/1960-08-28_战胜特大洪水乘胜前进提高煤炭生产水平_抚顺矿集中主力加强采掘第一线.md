Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, August 27th: Fushun Coal Mine workers, having overcome the extraordinary floods unseen in decades, are determined to take advantage of the favorable autumn weather to raise coal production to even higher levels.

Since mid-month, the entire mining bureau's production has seen a substantial increase. Compared to the first ten days of the month, the average daily output of raw coal has increased by 24.8%, and the average daily footage of tunneling has increased by 19.1%.

Recently, the Fushun coal mines' workers summarized the production for the first seven and a half months of this year and formulated plans for increased production and savings for the next four months, along with measures to complete the plans. The workers believe there are many favorable conditions for completing this year's coal production increase and savings plan. By the end of June this year, the entire mining bureau had already exceeded half of its coal production plan. The mass movement for the overall technical transformation of coal mines, centered on new exploration and extraction methods, has entered a new stage. Since leading cadres of various coal mines implemented office work underground, they have been better able to eat, live, work, and discuss matters with the workers. The hot and rainy month of August is coming to an end, and the good season for large-scale production increases is about to arrive. The workers are determined to make full use of these favorable conditions, overcome the difficulties in production, and complete and overfulfill this year's coal production increase and savings plan.

Under the leadership of the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Fushun Coal Mine, having achieved an initial victory in the fight against the floods, immediately took measures to improve coal production. First, it concentrated manpower and resources to repair some of the equipment damaged by heavy rain and mountain floods, and to restore the transportation lines within the open-pit mine. All mines and repair departments broke down barriers and launched a mass movement to repair machinery and equipment. In early and mid-August, the entire bureau mobilized an average of more than 10,000 people every day to participate in drainage and equipment repair. The West Open-Pit Mine suffered significant damage from the combined attacks of heavy rain and mountain floods. Shen Yue, First Secretary of the Fushun Municipal Committee, and Chen Jianxin, Secretary of the Secretariat and First Secretary of the Mining Area Party Committee, personally directed the work on-site, while organizing strong support from various industrial and mining enterprises throughout the city. Now, except for two electric picks and one electric locomotive that escaped the disaster and are currently under repair, all the roads and mechanical equipment within the twelve-li-long mine pit have been fully restored to production. Longfeng Mine, Laohutai Mine, and Shengli Mine, along with other underground mines, have shifted their focus to the production front, concentrating their main strength to reinforce the front lines of mining and excavation, while continuously strengthening flood prevention projects. After the mine and district leading cadres of Laohutai Coal Mine went deep into the mine for office work, they solved key problems with the workers and quickly repaired more than 800 meters of underground roadways, also ensuring the timely transfer of a new mining area to production.

Currently, the coal mines' workers are launching a new upsurge in the competition for increased production and savings. The workers of Longfeng Mine and Laohutai Mine, which produce high-quality coking coal, have launched a linked competition. In the competition, Longfeng Mine focused on tunneling work, increasing the number of coal mining faces put into production by nearly double, ensuring that the average daily output of coking coal in mid-month increased by 12.2% compared to the first ten days of the month. Laohutai's various coal mining districts, focusing on improving the utilization rate of coal mining faces and strengthening the maintenance of small machinery, launched a competition to produce 1,000 tons per day in the main coal mining areas, increasing the average daily output of coking coal in mid-month by 171 tons compared to the first ten days of the month. The Laohutai Mine's coal preparation plant launched a high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency competition, improving the recovery rate of refined coal, with the average daily output in mid-month being 207 tons higher than the daily production level in late July before the flood season. At the same time, the increased production and savings labor competitions in various mines are all closely focused on completing the daily and shift-based increased production and savings plans. The day shift of the coal mining section of the West Open-Pit Mine had a lower output than the night shifts due to more time spent on repairs, blasting, and transporting materials. The workers addressed this problem by launching a "Red First Shift, High Second Shift, Exceeding Third Shift" competition, with repair workers implementing "fast repairs" and blasting workers implementing "multiple blasting at once," greatly increasing the coal output time of the day shift and turning the low-yield shift into a high-yield shift.

The Party committees of various mines have strengthened their leadership over the competition. The West Open-Pit Mine, on the basis of leading cadres implementing office work in the pit, implemented political work in the pit, management work in the pit, and life service work to the coal face, organizing more than 100 cadres to go down into the pit to offer advice for increasing coal production, which was welcomed by the workers.

    战胜特大洪水乘胜前进提高煤炭生产水平
    抚顺矿集中主力加强采掘第一线
    据新华社抚顺27日电　战胜几十年未有的特大洪水的抚顺煤矿职工，决心乘秋高气爽的良好季节，把煤炭生产提高到更高的水平。
    从中旬以来，全矿务局的生产已有大幅度的提高，中旬和上旬相比，原煤平均日产量提高24.8％，掘进平均日进尺提高19.1％。
    最近，抚顺各煤矿的职工总结了今年前七个半月的生产，制定了今后四个月多的增产节约计划和完成计划的措施。工人们认为，完成今年的煤炭增产节约计划，有着多方面的有利条件。到今年6月底，全矿务局已经超额完成煤炭生产计划的一半；以新的开拓开采方法为中心的煤矿总体技术改造的群众运动，已迈进一个新的阶段；各煤矿领导干部实行井下办公以后，更好地和工人同吃同住同劳动同商量；高温多雨的8月就要过去，大增产的良好季节就要到来。工人们决心充分利用这些有利条件，克服生产中的困难，完成和超额完成今年的煤炭增产节约计划。
    抚顺煤矿在中共抚顺市委的领导下，取得抗洪斗争的初步胜利以后，立即采取措施提高煤炭生产。首先，集中人力、物力，抢修一部分被暴雨和山洪浸坏的设备，修复露天矿坑内的运输线路。各矿和各检修部门都打破界限，开展抢修机械设备的群众运动。8月上旬和中旬，全局每天平均都出动一万多人参加排水和抢修设备。西露天矿在暴雨和山洪的双重袭击下，受灾程度较大。抚顺市委第一书记沈越、书记处书记兼矿区党委第一书记陈建新，亲自到现场指挥，同时组织全市各工矿企业大力支援，现在这个煤矿除了脱险的两台电镐、一台电机车正在检修以外，十二华里长的矿坑里的所有路线盘道和机械设备，都已全部恢复生产，龙凤矿、老虎台矿、胜利矿等各井下作业的矿井，在不断加固防汛工程的基础上，都已把工作重点转移到生产战线上来，集中主力加强采掘第一线。老虎台煤矿的矿、区领导干部深入井下办公以后，和工人一起解决关键问题，迅速维修好井下八百多米长的巷道，还保证了一个新采区及时移交生产。
    当前，各煤矿职工掀起了一个增产节约竞赛的新高潮。生产优质炼焦煤的龙凤矿和老虎台矿职工，开展了挂钩竞赛。在竞赛中，龙凤矿狠抓掘进工作，使投入生产的采煤工作面比过去增加近一倍，保证了中旬的焦煤平均日产量比上旬提高12.2％。老虎台各采煤区围绕提高采煤工作面利用率、加强小型机械维护等五大关键，开展了采煤大掌子日产千吨的竞赛，使全矿中旬焦煤平均日产量比上旬增加一百七十一吨。老虎台矿选煤场开展了高产优质高效率竞赛，提高了精煤回收率，中旬平均日产量比汛前7月下旬的日产水平还高二百零七吨。同时，各矿的增产节约劳动竞赛，都紧紧围绕着完成当日当班的增产节约计划进行。西露天矿采煤段的白班因为检修、放炮、运料时间多，在日夜三班中产量较低，工人们便针对这个问题，展开了“头班红、二班高、三班超”的竞赛热潮，检修工实行了“快速检修”，放炮工实行“一次多放炮”，大大增加了白班的出煤时间，使低产班变为了高产班。
    各矿党委都加强了对竞赛的领导。西露天矿在领导干部实行坑下办公的基础上，实行政治工作下坑，管理工作下坑，生活服务工作到掌子头，组织一百多名干部下坑为煤炭增产出谋献计，受到职工们的欢迎。（附图片）
