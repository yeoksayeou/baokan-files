Xinhua News Agency, August 25th dispatch from Bamako: Malian Federal Prime Minister Keita returned to Sudan's capital, Bamako, on the morning of the 23rd from Dakar, and was welcomed by approximately 50,000 Sudanese people. According to a dispatch from Dakar, the Senegalese Council of Ministers met on the 22nd and approved a draft agreement for Senegal to join the "French Community" and a draft provisional agreement on cooperation between Senegal and France. Sanghor, Speaker of the Malian Federal Assembly and leader of the Senegalese Progressive Union (the ruling party), said at a press conference on the 23rd that the dispute between Senegal and Sudan arose from different political concepts.

A dispatch from Paris states that French President de Gaulle, fearing that the incident in the Malian Federation would affect the so-called "cooperation agreement" signed between France and the Malian Federation, hurriedly sent telegrams to Keita and Senegalese Prime Minister Dia on the 20th, requesting them to go to Paris to discuss the situation caused by Senegal's withdrawal from the Malian Federation.

The dispatch said that Keita, in his reply on the 23rd, informed de Gaulle that some officers were the main instigators of the situation, and that this matter was very serious. Maiga, the Malian Federation's representative in Paris, said that he believed the officers Keita mentioned in his letter referred to the French. Keita did not reply to de Gaulle about when he would go to Paris.

It is reported that Senegalese Prime Minister Dia arrived in Paris on the 23rd and held talks with de Gaulle. After the meeting, Dia told reporters, "We hope to sign a cooperation agreement with France as soon as possible."

    在塞内加尔事件以后
    凯塔总理回到苏丹
    据新华社25日讯　巴马科消息：马里联邦总理凯塔23日清晨从达喀尔回到苏丹首都巴马科，并且受到那里大约五万名苏丹人的欢迎。据达喀尔消息：塞内加尔部长会议22日开会，通过塞内加尔加入“法兰西共同体”的协定草案以及关于塞内加尔和法国合作的临时协定草案。马里联邦议会议长、塞内加尔进步联盟（执政党）领袖桑戈尔23日在记者招待会上说，塞内加尔和苏丹的争执是从不同的政治概念产生的。
    来自巴黎的消息说，法国总统戴高乐由于害怕马里联邦这次发生的事件会影响到法国同马里联邦签订的所谓“合作协定”，20日慌忙分别打电报给凯塔和塞内加尔总理迪亚，要求他们到巴黎去讨论由于塞内加尔退出马里联邦造成的局势。
    消息说，凯塔23日在回信中通知戴高乐说，一些军官是所造成的形势的主要制造者，这件事是十分严重的。马里联邦驻巴黎代表迈加说，他相信凯塔信中所提到的一些军官指的是法国人。凯塔没有答复戴高乐何时去巴黎。
    据报道，塞内加尔总理迪亚已在23日到达巴黎，并且同戴高乐举行了会谈。会后，迪亚向记者们说，“我们希望尽快地和法国签订合作协定。”
