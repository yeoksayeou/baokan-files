Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 21st: TASS reports that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Kuznetsov, on behalf of the Soviet government, met with UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on August 20th and issued a statement condemning the "UN Command" in the Congo for sending troops on August 18th to occupy the Leopoldville airport and obstruct Congolese troops from performing their duties at the airport, an action that violated Congolese sovereignty.

The statement said that the Soviet government firmly opposes the above-mentioned actions of the "UN Command." The Soviet government insists that the UN Secretary-General take measures to cancel the above-mentioned order of the "UN Command" and prevent any recurrence of actions that obstruct the authorities of the Republic of the Congo from administering its own airports (including Leopoldville airport).

The Soviet government also insists that Canadian troops be withdrawn from the Congo immediately, as Canada is an ally of Belgium, which is aggressing against the Republic of the Congo.

At a press conference held on the same day, Kuznetsov also read out the Soviet delegation's statement to Hammarskjöld regarding the memorandum on the so-called "civilian measures" plan for the Congo proposed by Hammarskjöld on August 12th. Hammarskjöld's plan stipulates the establishment of a "UN administrative body" in the Congo. This body, bearing the signboard of a "consultative group," actually possesses broad powers and is not subject to the orders of the Congolese government.

The statement pointed out that the Soviet government firmly opposes this so-called "civilian measures" plan and will vote against its adoption. It means restricting the sovereignty of the Congo and, in fact, turning the Congo into a trusteeship.

The statement pointed out that the United States and its allies currently occupy the most important positions in the UN agencies in the Congo, and they are attempting to develop the situation in the Congo in a direction favorable to the United States. This not only threatens the independence of the Republic of the Congo, but also sets a dangerous precedent for these countries to interfere in the national independence movements of colonies in the future.

The statement emphasized that the above-mentioned UN "civilian measures" plan in the Congo violates the basic principles of the UN Charter, because the UN Charter does not give the UN the right to interfere in matters that fall within the internal jurisdiction of a country. The implementation of this plan will only subject the future development of the independent Republic of the Congo to the interests of the group of countries headed by the United States. In fact, this also means establishing a new form of colonialist enslavement of the Congolese people under the guise of the UN flag.

### 苏联政府发表声明  反对联合国干涉刚果内政

    苏联政府发表声明
    反对联合国干涉刚果内政
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联外交部第一副部长库兹?佐夫受苏联政府的委托在20日拜会了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，并且发表声明，指责在刚果的“联合国司令部”8月18日派军队占领利奥波德维尔机场、阻挠刚果军队在机场执行任务这种侵犯刚果主权的行动。
    声明说，苏联政府坚决反对“联合国司令部”的上述行动。苏联政府坚持要求联合国秘书长采取措施，取消“联合国司令部”的上述命令，防止任何阻挠刚果共和国当局管辖本国的机场（包括利奥波德维尔机场在内）的行动重演。
    苏联政府还坚持要求加拿大军队立即撤出刚果，因为加拿大是侵略刚果共和国的比利时的盟国。
    库兹?佐夫在同一天举行的记者招待会上还宣读了苏联代表团就哈马舍尔德8月12日提出的所谓在刚果的“民政措施”计划备忘录致哈马舍尔德的声明。哈马舍尔德这个计划规定要在刚果建立一个“联合国行政机构”。这个挂着“谘询小组”招牌的机构实际上拥有广泛的权力，而且不服从刚果政府的命令。
    声明指出，苏联政府坚决反对这个所谓“民政措施”计划，并且将投票反对通过它。它意味着限制刚果的主权，事实上使刚果沦为托管地。
    声明指出，目前美国和它的盟国在刚果的联合国机构中占据了最重要的职位，他们正在企图使刚果局势朝着有利于美国的方向发展。这不仅会使刚果共和国的独立受到威胁，而且也为将来这些国家干涉殖民地民族独立运动开创了危险的先例。
    声明强调，上述联合国在刚果的“民政措施”计划违反联合国宪章的基本原则。因为联合国宪章并没有给联合国干涉属于一个国家内部权限的事务的权利。实现这一计划，就只会使独立的刚果共和国未来的发展屈从于以美国为首的国家集团的利益。实际上，这也意味着在联合国旗帜的掩护下确立对刚果的人民殖民主义奴役的新形式。
