Xinhua News Agency, Washington Dispatch: Amidst a clamor for expanding armaments and preparing for war within the United States, the U.S. government decided on the 17th to establish a central military planning body specifically for preparing nuclear attacks on the Soviet Union. This organization's task is to determine the targets to be struck in the event of an attack on the Soviet Union.

The decision to establish this body was made by U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates on the 17th during a full-day meeting with commanders of U.S. armed forces stationed around the world. Gates stated that the establishment of such an organization was "the most important decision (he) has participated in since arriving at the Pentagon." It is reported that Gates convened this meeting to formulate plans for maximizing the utilization of U.S. nuclear attack forces stationed around the world.

According to the U.S. news agency United Press International, the newly established organization's "mission is to draw up a complete list of targets in the Soviet Union and the specific weapons that should be used against those targets. The Joint Chiefs of Staff will study and approve this list and assign these targets to the appropriate forces."

The news agency stated that the U.S. plan is to uniformly deploy U.S. bombers, intercontinental missiles, and "Polaris" missiles launched from submarines and keep them in a state of readiness.

Gates announced that U.S. Strategic Air Command Commander Thomas Power has been appointed as the head of the new organization, while also continuing to serve as Strategic Air Command Commander. Gates stated that he hopes the organization can submit a list of targets in the Soviet Union for attacking during wartime to the Joint Chiefs of Staff by December of this year.

Eight high-ranking generals from the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force participated in the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa Dispatch: The Canadian magazine "Maclean's" published an article in its latest issue by its Washington editor, Sklander, pointing out that the advocacy for launching "pre-emptive wars" is gaining increasing ground within the ruling circles of the United States.

The article stated that the United States "is a country filled with clamoring for increased armaments, and the most active propagandists are the various military branches."

The article said that the U.S. military branches "are trying to win support for the notion that the U.S. military should have the right to launch an attack first."

The article pointed out that when this idea was initially promoted, "Pentagon strategists quietly spoke of 'preventive war' as if afraid of being heard." However, gradually, "they changed the wording and spoke of pre-emptive war in a firm voice." The article believes that this leaves no doubt that the Pentagon's Cold War warriors hope they can launch the attack first.

The article stated that in order to support and prepare for "pre-emptive wars," the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a report that, under the pretext of so-called "effectively containing possible aggressors," clamors that U.S. armed forces "should maintain a state" in which the United States itself can launch an attack before the United States and its allies are subjected to so-called "aggression." The report believes that "this is a deterrent factor that the United States should not abandon."

Xinhua News Agency, Washington Dispatch: At its annual meeting, which closed on August 10th, the Association of the United States Army passed a resolution, based on Eisenhower's recent special message to Congress, clamoring for further intensified armament expansion and war preparation.

The association demanded the mass production of missiles and the increase of active army forces from the current 870,000 to 1 million, and to re-equip them all with new weapons to make it a "sufficient deterrent force." The resolution also calls for sufficient airlift equipment to rapidly transport them to so-called "trouble spots."

At the association's three-day meeting, the U.S. Secretary of the Army and high-ranking military personnel from the Army vied with each other to issue belligerent calls.

In his keynote speech at the meeting, Secretary of the Army Bruck advocated for increased military spending to "modernize" the U.S. Army, develop missiles, and increase troop strength.

Army Chief of Staff Lemnitzer clamored at the meeting that the United States would never withdraw its U.S. troops stationed overseas, nor would it abolish its overseas military bases. He said that the U.S.'s "forward strategy" "requires the presence of U.S. troops overseas." This U.S. Army Chief of Staff clamored that the United States must prepare for both major wars and "limited wars."

Lieutenant General Oakes, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, and Lieutenant General Rogers, Deputy Commander for Development Programs of the U.S. Continental Army Command, also promoted a ten-year plan at the meeting to "modernize" the Army. Oakes revealed that this plan would require an increase in military spending of two to three billion U.S. dollars.

    美国成立准备进攻苏联的新军事机构
    发动“先发制人战争”的主张在统治集团内日益得势
    陆军参谋长叫嚣既要准备大战又要准备“有限战争”
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府在国内的一片扩军备战叫嚷声中，在17日又决定成立一个专门准备对苏联发动核进攻的中央军事计划机构。这个机构的任务是要确定一旦对苏联发动进攻时所要打击的目标。
    建立这个机构的决定是在美国国防部长盖茨17日在同美国驻世界各地的武装部队的指挥官举行的一整天会议上作出的。盖茨说，成立这样一个机构是“自从（他）到五角大楼以来所曾参加作出的最重要的决定”。据报道，盖茨召开这次会议的目的是要制定最大限度地利用美国遍布各地的核攻击部队的计划。
    美国通讯社合众国际社的消息说，新成立的机构的“任务是拟订出关于苏联的目标以及在对付这些目标时应该使用的具体武器的完全的名单。参谋长联席会议将研究和批准这张名单，并把这些目标分配给适当的部队。”
    这家通讯社说，美国的计划是要统一调配美国的轰炸机、洲际导弹和从潜艇发射的“北极星”导弹，并使它们处于准备好的状态中。
    盖茨宣布，美国战略空军司令托马斯·鲍威尔已经被任命为新机构的首脑，同时继续兼任战略空军司令。盖茨表示，他希望这个机构能在今年12月向参谋长联席会议提出发动战争时进攻苏联的目标的清单。
    参加这次会议的有美国陆、海、空三军的八个高级将领。
    新华社讯　渥太华消息：加拿大“麦克林”杂志在最近一期中刊载了它驻华盛顿编辑斯克兰德斯的一篇文章，指出发动“先发制人的战争”的主张在美国的统治集团中正越来越得势。
    这篇文章说，美国“是一个到处有着增加武器的叫嚷的国家，其中最积极的宣传者是各军种”。
    文章说，美国各军种“正在设法使人支持这样一种主张，就是美军应该有权首先发动进攻”。
    文章指出，在最初推行这种主张的时候，“五角大楼的战略家们曾经悄悄地谈到‘预防战’，好像害怕人听见似的”。但是，逐渐地“他们改变了这个字眼，以坚定地声音说出了先发制人战争”。文章认为，这使人毫不怀疑五角大楼的冷战战士希望他们能首先发动进攻。
    文章说，为了支持和准备“先发制人的战争”，美国众议院已经通过了一个报告，这个报告在所谓“有效地遏制可能的侵略者”的借口下，叫嚣美国的武装部队“应该保持这样一种状态”，即在美国和它的盟国在遭到所谓“进攻”之前，美国自己就能够发动进攻。报告认为“这是美国不应该弃绝的威慑因素”。
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国陆军协会在8月10日闭幕的年会上通过决议，依据艾森豪威尔最近在给国会的特别咨文里的主张，叫嚷必须进一步加紧扩军备战。
    这个协会要求大量生产导弹和把现役陆军部队从目前的八十七万人增加到一百万人，并且全部用新式武器重新装备他们，以便使它成为一支“充分的威慑力量”。决议还要求有足够的空运设备以便能迅速把它们运到所谓“出事地点”去。
    在这个协会历时三天的会议上，美国陆军部长和陆军方面的高级军人，竞相发出好战叫嚣。
    陆军部长布鲁克在会议上发表的主旨演说中，主张增加军费来使美国陆军“现代化”、发展导弹和增加兵员。
    陆军参谋长兰尼兹尔在会议上叫嚷美国决不会撤回它驻在海外的美国军队，也决不会撤消它的海外军事基地。他说，美国的“前缘策略”“需要有美军驻在海外”。这个美国陆军参谋长叫嚣美国既要准备大战，又要准备“有限战争”。
    陆军负责作战的副参谋长欧克斯中将和美国本土陆军司令部负责发展计划的副司令罗杰斯中将也在会议上鼓吹一项为期十年的使陆军“现代化”的计划。欧克斯透露，这项计划需要增加军事开支二十到三十亿美元。
