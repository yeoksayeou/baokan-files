Good Steward in the Deep Mountains and Dense Forests
By our reporter

Arriving at the Bikou People's Commune in Wen County, Longnan mountain area, one hears many people praising Wang Fengcai, the Party Branch Secretary of the Xujiawan Production Team. Some say: Wang Fengcai is a good example of implementing the "Four Together" work style; others praise him as a model of being both a leader and a soldier. For 360 days a year, his mind is full of problems, and his hands and feet never rest. The glorious deeds of leading the commune members in building the mountain area are endless.

Xujiawan is located next to the notoriously dangerous "Yinping Ancient Road," which has now been opened up as a highway. We advanced along the Bailong River, following the highway, crossed the Baishui River, passed through the Yulei Pass where Jiang Wei once defeated the enemy by fighting with his back to the river, and arrived at Xujiawan. Looking up, we saw majestic and steep mountains everywhere. The Xujiawan Production Team, with thirty-eight households and more than one hundred and twenty people, is scattered in seven mountain gullies stretching for tens of miles. We saw: wheat golden at the foot of the mountains, terraced fields layer upon layer on the mountainside, neat stone walls built around each plot, and robust corn growing lush and green. Male and female commune members were weeding the autumn fields, irrigating with diluted fertilizer, and the clear breeze carried bursts of hearty laughter and singing. ...

The suffering Xujiawan has changed! Its transformation is a testament to Wang Fengcai and the local farmers overcoming disaster and poverty together!

Wang Fengcai was originally from Bikou Town. His father worked as a hired laborer for a landlord, who nearly killed him with hard work, and the debts on his back kept growing. Forced to desperation, he had no choice but to abandon his young children and enter the mountains alone. From then on, Wang Fengcai became the landlord's "two-legged beast." Thirty years ago, he followed in his father's footsteps, forced by the landlord to leave Bikou Town and escape to Xujiawan. Here, the mountains are high, the forests are dense, the gullies are deep, and there are more stones than soil, with wild animals frequently appearing. In the old society, this was a forgotten place. Wang Fengcai moved stones to build walls, used two stone slabs as a roof, burned a patch of secondary forest, and dug open the stone layer to sow a seed. It was already not easy for crops to grow in these palm-sized "lying ox fields" and "stone cellar lands," but when the seedlings came out, the sun was like a ball of fire, scorching the seedlings to death with a single burst; a strong wind would blow, and flying stone shards would bury the seedlings in their nests; a rainstorm would wash away even the roots of the seedlings. By some miracle, they survived the many disasters, and in a good year, one mu of land would yield at most sixty catties of grain. People here often had to rely on wild vegetables and fruits to fill their stomachs. By the eve of liberation, there were only two families left in the entire Xujiawan. After liberation, people who had fled the famine returned one after another, and Wang Fengcai became the head of the agricultural cooperative. When he led the masses to embark on this path to happiness of collectivization, a discouraging thing happened in the cooperative: when Yangshan and Zuojiamen were discussing the prospects for rural development, two cooperative members said: This poor mountain gully will never catch up with the plains, and in the future, the plains will use tractors! We are planting "lying ox fields," so we might as well move to the plains sooner. Some people agreed with this idea and wanted to abandon Xujiawan and resettle in the plains. When Wang Fengcai first heard that someone disliked the mountains, his heart felt like it was being stabbed with needles. He blamed them for forgetting their roots after their wounds had healed; but then he thought, one cannot blame the cooperative members for forgetting their roots, everyone just wants to use tractors and build socialism quickly. However, how can he do good things for the cooperative members in such a mountain gully, build the mountain area, and build socialism? This was a problem he had not been able to figure out for a long time. At this time, the county organized him to visit Dengjiabao in Wu Mountain County to see their water and soil conservation work. When he got there, he saw: dense young forests on the mountains, clear flowing water in the canals, ducks swimming, machines rumbling, and millet growing better than in the plains... The people of Dengjiabao said that this was also a poor place, with thousands of gullies and ravines, and droughts nine years out of ten. Girls from the plains were unwilling to marry into the mountains. At this moment, Wang Fengcai understood a principle: as long as we learn from the revolutionary spirit of the people of Dengjiabao, poor mountains and evil waters can be transformed, and Xujiawan can also be transformed into paradise. After returning to the cooperative, he proposed to everyone to learn from the soaring spirit of the people of Dengjiabao, work hard, and transform the stone cellar land of Xujiawan.

After the autumn harvest, Wang Fengcai led some of the cooperative members to Zuojiamen to pick up pebbles and move stones, and began to transform the stone cellar land. He wanted to drive everyone to transform the mountain area through practical action. At the very beginning, he encountered obstacles. Cooperative member Wang Zhongcheng said: "Every pebble is worth four liang of oil, and nothing grows on top of stones except more stones, I don't see any benefit in picking up stones."

"No benefit? If the stones are picked up, you'll hit fewer plows, and you'll hoe more often, that's always a benefit!" A group of young people argued unconvinced.

"How much grain can that produce?"

"Believe it or not, it's up to you! The land of Wang Zhongyin in Yangshan is a mirror. It used to be a stone cellar land, but he picked up the stones and leveled the ground a few years ago, and it turned into a 'gold scraping board.' I think we should go and take a look," an old cooperative member suggested.

Wang Fengcai supported this suggestion and led everyone to Wang Zhongyin's land. Wang Zhongyin said with a smile: "Before, I had little land and many people, so I came up with this idea. Originally, one mu of stone cellar land could only yield sixty catties, but in recent years it has increased to two hundred catties. Even I didn't expect it!"

The facts educated everyone. Wang Fengcai also invited several old farmers and Wang Zhongyin to summarize their experience in transforming stone cellar land and promptly publicized it among the cooperative members, so a mass movement to transform stone cellar land was launched in full swing. In the winter of 1957, the Party branch led all the cooperative members to focus on the stone cellar land in Zuojiamen, concentrated labor, and transformed the stone cellar fields. Wang Fengcai took the lead as a soldier, leading the way in picking up pebbles and moving stones. The stones in the fields were all piled on the edge of the land and built into stone walls. It was the coldest time of winter, and everyone's hands and feet were frozen and swollen, but they still insisted on working. When some people saw the difficulties and wanted to retreat, Wang Fengcai led everyone in a discussion. The cooperative members said: "If we don't work during the slack winter season, we won't be able to take care of it during the busy spring season." "A few days of hard work, ten thousand years of happiness, this is what we should do." The land was leveled, and the stones were picked up. Wang Fengcai led the cooperative members to the deep mountains and old forests to dig up humus, carrying it back to the fields one load after another, and covering the newly leveled ten or so mu of land with a layer more than a foot thick. After the Spring Festival, Wang Fengcai led the Party members and Youth League members to deep plow and plant Golden Queen corn as the cooperative's experimental field. In order to strive for high yields, Wang Fengcai went to the Xiyuan Production Team of Chengguan Commune to learn from their experience in irrigating with diluted fertilizer and weeding. Later, the corn was harvested, with an average yield of more than five hundred and sixty catties per mu! The fact of the bumper harvest strengthened people's confidence and boosted the morale of the masses. People said: Poor mountains and evil waters can be overcome.

In the winter of 1958, relying on the infinite power of the People's Commune, they expanded the movement to transform stone cellar land from Zuojiamen to all the mountain villages of the Xujiawan Production Team; from picking up pebbles and moving stones to making their own explosives to blast away large stones of several cubic meters, seizing land from the mountains and opening up good terraced fields of several mu or dozens of mu. Just as the battle was at a critical juncture, Wang Fengcai fell ill and could not eat. The cooperative members all advised him to rest, but he couldn't stay at home no matter what, so he brought a pot to the field, brewing medicine while leading the cooperative members to fight against the stubborn rocks. Wang Fengcai's action of working while sick greatly encouraged the masses. Many stones were moved away, and large pieces of flat land appeared! In the spring of 1959, Xujiawan changed. The "lying ox fields" were transformed into wide terraced fields, and the newly built stone embankments of the cooperative members were like a copper wall and iron barrier, blocking the ferocious invasion of the Baishui River and protecting the more than twenty mu of good rice fields newly seized from the river滩. Hard work yielded fruitful results. In the autumn of 1959, there were good crops all over the mountains and fields. On the land that people worked hard on, corn cobs more than a foot long grew, and the trial planting of peanuts and sugar beets brought news of high yields in the first year. Who knew that the crops about to ripen would be trampled by wild animals in the dense forest. More than two mu of corn in Yangshan were trampled clean by wild animals in one go. In the past, when encountering animal damage, people would hide in shacks, beat gongs and fire cannons, and light pine torches to scare away the wild animals. Now, there are crops of the commune everywhere, and we can't just chase them away and be done with it. We must completely eliminate animal damage in order to protect the wealth of the entire commune. Relying on his years of hunting experience, Wang Fengcai organized the people. A group of people stayed in the shacks and continued to guard the crops using the old methods; another group of ten or so good hunters, carrying dry food, firelocks, and crossbows, were led by him personally to encircle and suppress the animals in the mountains. They worked day and night, regardless of the weather, eating and living in the mountains. In one autumn, they hunted a total of twenty-five wild boars, black bears, and other harmful animals, protecting the harvested crops. The escaped harmful animals also fled to the old forests in the back mountains, no longer daring to come down the mountains to disturb.

In this way, Wang Fengcai led everyone to move mountain stones, make rivers give way, make wild animals flee, and make river滩 offer treasures, turning the poor mountains and evil waters of Xujiawan into a happy nest. In 1959, the average grain yield per mu was 402 catties, and the average grain per person increased from 200 catties to 1,660 catties. Every household had savings. People described their lives as "rising step by step." In previous years, people in the plains called the farmers of Xujiawan "those who wear tattered sheepskin jackets." Now, people come in droves to visit and learn from the spirit of the people of Xujiawan who strive for progress and work hard. When the cooperative members talk to visitors about the changes in their area, they sincerely thank the leadership of the Party and unanimously praise Wang Fengcai as their "good steward." Those who wanted to move down the mountain also no longer want to leave.

This year, Xujiawan has once again won a bumper summer harvest. When we arrived here, Wang Fengcai and the cooperative members were working day and night by the mountains and rivers to rush to repair wooden boats to welcome the summer harvest. We asked him: Why are you in such a hurry? Wang Fengcai said: "Oh! Last year, we sold 70,000 catties of surplus grain, which was transported by people, animals, and rafts for a whole half a year. This year, there will be at least 100,000 catties. If we don't find a way to repair a large ferry boat sooner, how can we keep up with the demand?" A cooperative member proudly added: "In the past, we were a place where people went out to beg for food with sticks, but now we sell surplus grain by the boatload!" This is a meaningful sentence. It tells people that as long as we strive for progress, joy and happiness will appear on any land in the motherland.

    深山密林里的好管家
    本报记者
    来到陇南山区的文县碧口人民公社，听见许多人在赞扬徐家湾生产队的党支部书记王凤才。有人说：王凤才是贯彻“四同”作风的好榜样；也有人夸他是亦帅亦兵的典范。他一年三百六十天，脑子里装满问题，手腿闲不住，领导社员建设山区的光荣事迹，说也说不完。
    徐家湾座落在以艰险闻名的“阴平古道”旁，现在这里已经开辟了公路。我们沿着白龙江、顺着公路前进，渡过白水江，穿过当年姜维背水破敌的玉垒关，来到徐家湾。抬头四望，到处是巍峨陡峭的大山。徐家湾生产队三十八户、一百二十多口人，散居在纵横数十里的七个山沟里。我们看到：山脚下麦子一片金黄，山腰间梯田层层，块块地边砌着整齐的石围墙，肥壮的玉米长的流绿滴翠。男女社员正在给秋田锄草，灌稀肥，清风传来阵阵爽朗的笑声和歌声。……
    苦难的徐家湾变了！它的变化，是王凤才和这里的农民一起战胜灾难和贫困的见证！
    王凤才原是碧口镇人，他爹给财主当雇工，一身肉快折磨光了，背上的债却越来越多，被逼得走投无路，只好抛下幼儿，只身进了山。从此，王凤才就成了财主的“两脚兽”。三十年前，他又步上了父亲的后尘，让财主逼的咬咬牙离开了碧口镇，逃到了徐家湾。这里，山大，林密，沟深，石头比泥土多，野兽经常出没。在旧社会，这里是被人遗忘了的地方。王凤才在这里搬石垒墙，盖两块石板当屋顶，烧片梢林，挖开石层播下一粒籽。这些巴掌大的“卧牛田”，“石窖地”能够长庄稼已不容易，但是苗出来了，太阳像团火，把禾苗一股劲烫死；大风一刮，石片乱飞，田苗窝子就盖得死死的；一场暴雨，连禾苗根子也找不见了。侥幸熬过了三灾八难，好年成时，一亩地顶多打六十多斤粮。这里的人经常只好靠野菜、野果充饥。到了解放前夕，全徐家湾只有两户人家。解放以后，逃荒的人陆续回来，王凤才也当了农业社的社长。当他带领群众顺着这条通往幸福的集体化大道迈进的时候，社里却发生了一件叫人沮丧的事：阳山和左家沟门在讨论农村发展前景的时候，有两户社员说：这么个穷山沟，再变也赶不上川里；往后，川里就用拖拉机啦！我们种的是“卧牛田”，不如早点搬到川里去。有些人同意这个意见，想扔掉徐家湾，到川里去重新安家立业。王凤才乍一听有人嫌山里不好，心里像针扎一样，他埋怨他们好了疮疤忘了痛；后来转念一想，不能怪社员忘本，大家也是想快点使用拖拉机，快一点建设社会主义。但是，在这样个山沟里，怎样能给社员办好事情，建设山区，建设社会主义呢？这是他很久没有想清楚的问题。这时，县上组织他去武山县邓家堡参观水土保持工作。他到那里一看：山上是密密的幼林，渠里有清清的流水，鸭群游荡，机器隆隆，谷子长得赛过了平川……听邓家堡的人介绍说：原先这里也是个穷地方，千沟万壑，十年九旱，川下的姑娘也不愿嫁到山上来。这时，王凤才想透了一个道理，只要学习邓家堡人民的革命干劲，穷山恶水就能变样，徐家湾也能变天堂。他回社后，就向大家提出了学习邓家堡人民的冲天干劲，发奋图强，改造徐家湾石窖地的计划。
    秋收过后，王凤才就带领一部分社员到左家沟门，拣石子、搬石头，动手改造石窖地，他想通过实际行动带动大家改造山区，刚一开始，就碰到了阻碍，社员王仲成说：“一颗石子四两油，除了石子没长头，我看拣石子没有什么好处”。
    “没好处？石子拣掉了，少打几页铧，多锄几遍草，总是好处吧！”一群青年不服气地争论了起来。
    “那能打多少粮食？”
    “信不信，不由人！阳山王仲银的那块地是面镜子，原先那也是个石窖地，前几年拣了石子，整平地面，变成了刮金板，我看咱们还是去看看”。一位老社员建议说。
    王凤才支持了这个建议，带领众人来到王仲银的地里，王仲银笑迷迷地给大家说：“先前，俺地少，人口多，才想出了这个办法。原来一亩只能收六十来斤的石窖地，这几年增加到了两百斤，连我自己也没想到！”
    事实教育了大家。王凤才又请了几个老农和王仲银一块总结了改造石窖地的经验，及时在社员中宣传，于是改造石窖地的群众运动便轰轰烈烈地展开了。1957年冬天，党支部领导全体社员，以左家沟门的那块石窖地为重点，集中劳力，改造石窖田。王凤才挂帅当兵，带头拣石子、搬石头，地里的石头都垒在地边上砌成了石墙。这时正是数九寒天，手脚都冻肿了，大家还是坚持干。有人看到困难想退缩，王凤才领着大家讨论。社员们说：“冬天农闲不干，开春农忙想干也顾不上。”“辛苦几天，幸福万年，这是应该的。”地平了，石头拣净了，王凤才又领着社员们到深山老林里刨腐植质，一背斗一背斗背到地里，一直把新平的十来亩地垫了一尺多厚。过了春节，王凤才又领着党团员进行深翻，种上了金皇后玉米，作为社里的试验田。为了力争高额丰产，王凤才又跑到城关公社西元生产队去取经，学习他们灌稀肥、锄草的经验。后来，玉米丰收了，平均亩产五百六十多斤！丰收的事实坚定了人们的信心，鼓舞了群众的斗志，人们说：穷山恶水可以战胜。
    1958年冬天，他们又仗着人民公社的无穷威力，把改造石窖地的运动由左家沟门扩展到徐家湾生产队所有的山庄；从拣石子、搬石块发展到自造炸药炸掉几方、几十方的大石块，向山争地，开辟了几亩、几十亩一块的方方正正的好梯田。正当战斗紧张的关头，王凤才病倒了，饭也进不了口，社员们都劝他休息，可是他在家里怎么也蹲不住，就把沙罐子带到地头，一面熬药，一面领导社员和顽石作战。王凤才带病工作的行动，大大地鼓舞了群众，许多石头被搬掉了，大块平地出现了！1959年的春天，徐家湾变样了。“卧牛田”变成了宽大的台阶梯田，社员们新砌的石堤，像一道铜墙铁壁堵住了凶暴的白水江的侵袭，护住了从河滩里新夺来的二十多亩好稻田。辛勤的劳动，结出了丰硕的果实。1959年秋天，漫山遍野都是一片好庄稼。在人们辛苦经营的土地上，结出了一尺来长的玉米棒子，试种的花生、甜菜，第一年就传来了高产的预报。谁知将要成熟的庄稼，却又受到密林里的野兽的践踏。阳山的二亩多玉米一次就被野兽践踏光了。从前，遇到兽害，人们都是躲在窝棚里鸣锣放炮，点起松明火把，把野兽惊走就算了。现在，到处都是公社的庄稼，再不能赶跑就算完事，必须彻底消灭兽害，才能保住全公社的财富。王凤才凭着多年打猎经验，把人们组织起来。一批人守在窝棚里，继续用老办法看守庄稼；另外组织了十来个好猎手，带着干粮，背上火枪和弩箭，由他亲自率领进山围剿。他们不分阴晴昼夜，吃在山上、住在山上，一秋天，共猎获了二十五只野猪、黑熊和其它害兽，保住了丰收的庄稼。漏网的害兽也纷纷向后山老林里逃命，再不敢下山搔扰。
    就是这样，王凤才带领大家让山石搬家，河水让路，野兽逃窜，河滩献宝，使穷山恶水的徐家湾变成了幸福窝。1959年粮食平均亩产四百零二斤，每人平均有粮从二百斤提高到一千六百六十斤，家家户户都有存款。人们形容自己的日子是“步步登高”。前些年，平川上的人把徐家湾的农民叫做“穿烂羊皮袄的”，现在人们成群结队的到这里参观取经，学习徐家湾人们发奋图强，艰苦奋斗的精神。社员们向来客谈起当地的变化时，都衷心感激党的领导，异口同声地称赞王凤才是自己的“好管家人”。那些想搬下山的人也都不想走了。
    今年，徐家湾又赢得了夏季大丰收。我们来到这里的时候，王凤才正和社员在山野江畔夜以继日地赶修木船，迎接夏收。我们问他：为什么这样急？王凤才说：“哟！去年卖了七万斤余粮，人背、畜驮、筏子放，整整运了半年；今年最少也不下十万斤，不早点设法修只大渡船，怎么能赶得上需要呢？”旁边一个社员骄傲地补充说：“从前，我们这拉棍子出去要饭的地方，如今也整船整船地卖余粮了！”这是一句意味深长的话，它告诉人们：只要发奋图强，祖国的任何一块土地都会出现欢乐和幸福。
