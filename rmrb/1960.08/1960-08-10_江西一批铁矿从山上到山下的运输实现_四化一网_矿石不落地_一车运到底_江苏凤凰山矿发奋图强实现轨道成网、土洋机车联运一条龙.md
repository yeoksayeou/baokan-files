Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 9th - Most of the forty-plus iron ore mines in Jiangxi Province have already achieved or are in the process of achieving the goal of "ore not touching the ground, transported from start to finish." In mines that have already achieved this, ore blasted from the mining area falls directly into mine cars on horizontal tracks on the mountain. After the mine cars are filled, they slide down to horizontal tracks at the foot of the mountain via cableways or chutes, automatically pouring the ore into storage bins, which then release it into vehicles waiting to transport it. The mine cars that have slid down are then hoisted back up the mountain by winches. This cycle repeats, eliminating the need for manual loading, unloading, and transport. Only one or two people are needed to operate the machinery, and the ore goes directly to the foot of the mountain.

Vigorously promoting "ore not touching the ground, transported from start to finish" is an important measure by relevant departments in Jiangxi Province to concentrate efforts on reducing and eliminating intermediate loading and unloading links in ore transportation. The forty-plus iron ore mines currently in Jiangxi Province are generally poorly equipped due to their recent establishment, especially with regard to internal and external mine transportation. Most ore from the mountain to the foot of the mountain must go through two or three manual loading and unloading links. From the foot of the mountain to transportation trunk lines, most also rely on civil transport tools with lower transport capacity for loading and unloading due to narrow transportation lines. In the past, due to the difficulty of ore transportation, large quantities of ore were long-termly accumulated on the mountains and could not be quickly transported down, which not only affected the expansion of the mine's mining work surface but also failed to rapidly meet the needs of the rapidly advancing steel production for raw materials. To this end, since the second quarter of this year, the Party committees at all levels and enterprises have listed the problem of internal and external mine transportation as the main focus of mine technical transformation. They first focused on the central link of internal mine transportation from the mountain to the foot of the mountain, mobilizing workers to adopt methods based on indigenous resources and combining indigenous and foreign methods, building large numbers of indigenous machines and equipment, and vigorously promoting "four modernizations and one network": cableways for high mountains, chutes for slopes, winches for lifting, and track-mounted vehicles for flat ground, forming a comprehensive linkage network.

Vigorously renovating and building dedicated lines from the mines to the transportation trunk lines is the second aspect of Jiangxi's efforts to reduce and eliminate intermediate links in ore transportation. In order to connect internal mine transportation with the transportation trunk lines leading to steel plants, various localities have built more than 200 kilometers of indigenous railways and simple roads from the foot of the mountains to the transportation trunk lines, and have also converted the original single tracks into double tracks, narrow gauges into wide gauges, small cars into large cars, and single cars into trains. In the past, the Shan Tie Keng Iron Mine transported ore to the Fenyi Railway Station through narrow-gauge tracks and highways, and then loaded it onto trains to transport it to steel plants. Dozens of trucks were busy transferring ore every day. Now, they have laid 15 kilometers of wide-gauge tracks with 18-kilogram light rails from the mine to the Fenyi Station, allowing trains to directly enter the mine to load and directly transport the ore to steel plants, thereby completely eliminating the truck transfer link and ensuring that the amount of ore produced daily is the amount of ore transported out. The Jiujiang Chengmenshan Iron Mine used the same method to build a 17-kilometer-long wide-gauge track to the Shahe Station of the Nanxun Railway, directly transporting ore to steel plants, which promoted a doubling of ore production and transportation volume.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing - Workers at the Phoenix Mountain Iron Mine in Jiangsu Province worked hard and relied on their own efforts to realize "five modernizations and one dragon" in mine transportation. "Five modernizations" are track-based, locomotive-based, hopper-based, chute-based, and winch-based; "one dragon" is mining, loading, transporting, processing, and factory delivery, a one-stop service with a combination of indigenous and foreign locomotives. After the realization of "five modernizations and one dragon," the short-distance truck transportation was eliminated, the long-standing key problem of mine transportation not keeping up with mining and crushing processing was solved, the transportation capacity was increased by more than two times, and the great leap forward in production was powerfully promoted.

In order to change the situation of transportation not keeping up with production, the Party committee secretary took the lead, mobilized workers to launch a great debate, and established the lofty ambition of self-reliance and hard work. Then, the leading cadres at all levels of the mine were organized to go deep into the front line of production, eating, working, thinking, and innovating with the masses. They focused on the overall goal of realizing locomotive transportation and eliminating short-distance truck transportation, grasped the outstanding problems of insufficient locomotives and mine cars, blocked tracks, insufficient hoppers, and the maintenance and repair of the original locomotive, mine car, and other equipment transportation tools, and formulated a phased plan for concentrated assaults, launching a mass movement to vigorously carry out transportation technology revolution.

In the innovation movement, the mine's workers always carried forward the spirit of self-reliance to overcome difficulties. Without locomotives and mine cars, the maintenance assault team repaired six dilapidated internal combustion locomotives and more than 80 large and small mine cars overnight, and vigorously built indigenous equipment, successfully manufacturing two indigenous internal combustion locomotives; if the road was blocked, they immediately filled the roadbed and extended the track, changing a single track of nearly 700 meters long into a double track. They also built a marshalling yard and on-site dispatching room at the entrance of the Phoenix Mountain lane. Through this series of technical transformations, they basically did not ask the higher authorities for any equipment and materials, and made the mines of Xiaozhang Mountain, Niushan Mountain, and Zhaolong Mountain, which were originally unconnected by tracks and relied solely on automobile transportation, realize locomotive-based and track-based locomotive networking and track networking. At the same time, they also opened up a new 500-meter-long branch line to the bank of the Qinhuai River, which solved the problem of water transportation of ore and reduced the pressure on land-based ore transfer and transportation.

After the transportation key was solved, the contradiction of loading and unloading not keeping up appeared again. Under the leadership of the mine's Party committee, the workers continued to adopt the spirit of continuous revolution and continued to adopt indigenous and foreign methods, relying on their own efforts, to vigorously carry out loading and unloading technology revolution. If the insufficient number of hoppers affected transportation, the leading cadres worked with the workers to rush to renovate and install the hoppers. They also opened up level lanes to excavate trenches, install winches, and build landslide tracks, realizing loading hopperization, chute-based and winch-based loading in one go, which increased the loading efficiency of the mining site by three to ten times.

    江西一批铁矿从山上到山下的运输实现“四化一网”
    矿石不落地　一车运到底
    江苏凤凰山矿发奋图强实现轨道成网、土洋机车联运一条龙
    新华社南昌9日电　江西省四十多个铁矿山大部分已经实现或正在实现“矿石不落地，一车运到底”的要求。已经达到这一要求的矿山，矿石从采场爆破出来，立即就落在山上水平道的矿车中；矿车装满矿石以后，便通过索道或溜槽滑往山下水平道，自动把矿石倒入储矿仓，漏入山下待运的车辆；然后，又把滑到山下的矿车通过卷扬机提升上山。如此循环往复，矿石不需要人力装卸搬运，不需要中间落地转运，只要一两个人操纵机械，就可以直达山下。
    大搞“矿石不落地，一车运到底”，是江西省有关部门集中力量减少和消灭矿石运输中间装卸搬运环节的重要措施。江西全省现有的四十多个铁矿山，因为兴办不久，设备一般都比较差，特别是矿山内外运输困难较多。矿石从山上到山下，大部分都要经过两三次人力装卸搬运环节，从山下到交通干线，又因为交通线路狭窄，也大多依靠运力较低的民运工具装卸转运。过去，由于矿石运输困难，大批矿石长期积压山上不能很快运下来，既影响了矿山采矿工作面的伸展，又不能迅速满足高速跃进中的钢铁生产对原料的需要。为此，各地和各企业的党委从今年二季度以来，就把抓矿山内外运输问题列为矿山技术改造的主攻方向。他们首先围绕山上到山下这一矿山内部运输中心，发动职工采用以土为主、土洋结合的办法，大造土机械和土设备，大搞“四化一网”：高山索道化，斜坡溜槽化，提升卷扬化，平地车子轨道化，全面组成联动网。
    大力改造和兴修矿山到交通干线之间的专用线路，是江西减少和消灭矿石运输中间环节的第二个方面。各地为了使矿山内部运输跟通往钢铁厂的交通干线连成一线，兴修了山下到交通干线之间的土铁路、简易公路等二百多公里，并且把原有的单道改成双道，窄轨改成宽轨，小车改成大车，一车改为列车。山铁坑铁矿过去通过窄轨道和公路把矿石运到分宜火车站，然后再装上火车运往钢铁厂，一天几十辆大汽车转运矿石都忙不过来；现在，他们用十八公斤的轻轨从矿山到分宜车站铺设了十五公里的宽轨道，使火车列车直接开进矿山装车直运钢铁厂，从而完全消灭了汽车转运环节，做到日产多少矿石就运出多少矿石。九江城门山铁矿用同样办法，修起了十七公里长的宽轨道通南浔铁路沙河车站，把矿石直运钢铁厂，促使矿石产量和运量成倍提高。
    据新华社南京电　江苏省凤凰山铁矿职工发奋图强，自力更生，使矿内运输一举实现了“五化一龙”。“五化”是轨道化、机车化、漏斗化、溜槽化、卷扬化；“一龙”是采矿、装运、加工出厂，土洋机车联接运输一条龙。实现“五化一龙”以后，消灭了短驳汽车运输，解决了长期以来矿内运输跟不上采矿和破碎加工的关键问题，运输能力提高两倍以上，有力地推动了生产大跃进。
    为了改变运输跟不上生产的状况，党委书记挂帅，发动职工展开大鸣大放，树立了自力更生，发奋图强的雄心大志。接着，又组织矿上各级领导干部深入生产第一线，同群众同吃，同劳动，同想办法，同搞革新。他们围绕实现机车化运输和消灭短驳汽车运输这一总的目标，抓住机车头和矿车不足，轨道不通，漏斗不够，以及原有的机车头、矿车等设备运输工具的维护检修工作等突出问题，制订出分期分批进行突击的规划，掀起了大搞运输技术革命的群众运动。
    在革新运动中这个矿的职工始终发扬了自力更生地克服困难的精神。没有机车头和矿车，就由检修突击队连夜检修好破旧内燃机车头六台，大小矿车八十多辆，并且大搞土设备，又制造成功土内燃机车两台；道路不通，马上就填路基，延长轨道，把一条近七百米长的单轨改为双轨。他们还在凤凰山巷道口修建了调车场和现场调度室。通过这一系列的技术改造，他们基本上没有向上级要什么设备和材料，就使原来不通轨道、专靠汽车运输的小张山、牛山和罩龙山等矿山，实现了机车成龙轨道成网的机车化、轨道化。同时，他们还新辟了一条五百多米长的岔道通至秦淮河边，解决了矿石的水运问题，减轻了陆路矿石外调运输的压力。
    运输关键解决以后，又出现了装卸跟不上的矛盾。在矿党委的领导下，职工们又以不断革命的精神，继续采取土洋并举，自力更生的办法，大搞装卸技术革命。漏斗不够影响运输，领导干部就同职工一道突击改装和安装好了漏斗。他们还打通平巷开挖堑沟，安装卷扬机，修建滑坡道等，一气呵成地实现了装车漏斗化，溜槽化，卷扬化，使采矿场装车效率提高三倍到十倍。（附图片）
