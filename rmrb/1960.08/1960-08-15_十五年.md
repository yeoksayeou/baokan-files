    Fifteen Years
    Gu Ming
    August, fifteen years ago, was a great month.
    On August 8, 1945, the Soviet government declared war on Japan.
    On August 9th, Chairman Mao issued "The Last Battle Against the Japanese Bandits," calling on all anti-Japanese forces of the Chinese people to launch a nationwide counter-offensive, closely and effectively coordinating with the Soviet Union and other Allied countries in combat. The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army vigorously expanded the liberated areas, annihilated the enemies entrenched on our country's territory, and millions of people in the occupied areas also prepared armed uprisings to eliminate the enemies.
    On August 14th, Japan announced its unconditional surrender.
    On August 15th, the Soviet army entered Korea north of the 38th parallel, and the people of North Korea were freed from imperialist rule and liberated.
    On August 19th, under the leadership of the "Vietnam Independence League," the Vietnamese people launched a general armed uprising, liberated Hanoi, and became the famous "August Revolution."
    In August 1945, Asia was swept by a storm of shaking off imperialist enslavement and striving for independence and liberation.
    But at this time, American imperialism invaded South Korea, and its forces also began to invade southern Vietnam, and in China, under the guise of helping with the reception, it supported Chiang Kai-shek in launching a full-scale civil war in various ways. As a result, Asia was once again plunged into war.
    Fifteen years have passed, and in these fifteen years, American imperialism has suffered heavy losses in Asia, suffering disastrous defeats in China, Korea, and Vietnam. America's situation is not good worldwide either. Over the past fifteen years, the power of the people has been rising, and the power of imperialism has been declining. One colony and dependent country after another has broken free from the chains of imperialism, and the flags of independent, democratic, and peaceful countries are raised one after another in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
    Korea, which is closely related to our country, is a thorn in the side of American imperialism. Less than a year after the establishment of our People's Republic of China, American imperialism could not wait to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and attempted to strangle our country shortly after its founding. However, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, in close unity, finally crushed the imperialists' conspiracy and defeated its frantic offensive, forcing it to sit down and accept ceasefire negotiations. This fact proves that the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism, can also be completely defeated, thereby strengthening the confidence of the people of all countries in their struggles, inspiring the will of the people of all countries to fight, and thoroughly shattering the myth of the invincibility of American imperialism.
    The countless experiences of the people of all countries in the world in their struggle against imperialism since World War II have repeatedly demonstrated that we must not harbor any unrealistic illusions about American imperialism, such a most ferocious enemy, and other colonialists, but must wage a tit-for-tat struggle against it. That is, when it engages in war deterrence and launches wars of aggression, we must dare to fight back and not be intimidated by it; when it plays peace conspiracies, we must be good at identifying and exposing its hypocritical tactics and not fall into its trap.
    Over the past fifteen years, the storm of struggle has become more and more fierce day by day. Today, the storm of struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America has shaken the entire world. The days when imperialism arbitrarily trampled on Asia, Africa, and Latin America are gone forever. The overall situation is very favorable for the struggles of the people of all countries to win independence. A new page has been opened in the history of mankind, and the development of the situation fully demonstrates that our era is an era in which the forces of peace overwhelm the forces of war, the forces of the people overwhelm the forces of reaction, and the forces of socialism overwhelm the forces of imperialism. We are now in an era where the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind. The broad masses of awakened people have learned bloody lessons from a long period of exploitation, extraction, and enslavement, and have found new ways to resist the reactionary armed superiority and achieve their own victory.
    Chairman Mao said it well: "The achievement of world peace mainly depends on the struggles of the people of all countries," "The people are the decisive factor. Relying on the unity and struggle of the people, we will surely defeat imperialism and their running dogs and achieve lasting world peace." The history of the past fifteen years has fully proved the correctness of this statement, and the next fifteen years and even longer history will continue to prove it.

    十五年
    顾明
    十五年前的8月，是一个伟大的月份。
    1945年8月8日，苏联政府宣布对日作战。
    8月9日，毛主席发表了《对日寇的最后一战》，号召中国人民的一切抗日力量举行全国规模的反攻，密切而有效力地配合苏联及其他同盟国作战。八路军新四军猛烈地扩大解放区，歼灭盘踞在我国国土上的敌人，沦陷区的千百万群众也准备武装起义消灭敌人。
    8月14日，日本宣布无条件投降。
    8月15日，苏联军队进驻北纬三十八度以北的朝鲜，北朝鲜人民摆脱了帝国主义统治，获得了解放。
    8月19日，在“越南独立同盟”的领导下，越南人民举行武装总起义，解放了河内，成为有名的“8月革命”。
    1945年的8月，亚洲卷起了摆脱帝国主义奴役，争取独立解放的风暴。
    可是就在这时候，美帝国主义侵入了南朝鲜，他的势力也开始侵入了越南南部，并在中国打着帮助接收的幌子，用各种方式支持蒋介石发动了全面内战。于是，亚洲又陷入了战火之中。
    十五年过去了，在这十五年里，美帝国主义在亚洲碰得头破血流，在中国、在朝鲜、在越南都惨败了。在全世界，美国的遭遇也不好。十五年来人民力量越来越上升，帝国主义势力越来越下降。殖民地附属国一个接着一个摆脱了帝国主义的锁链，独立、民主、和平国家的旗帜一面接着一面在亚、非、拉丁美洲升起。
    和我国唇齿相关的朝鲜是美帝国主义的眼中钉。我们中华人民共和国建立还不到一年，美帝国主义就迫不及待地向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进攻，并企图乘我国建国不久就加以扼杀，可是我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在紧密团结下终于粉碎了美帝国主义的阴谋妄想，打退了它的疯狂进攻，逼得它不得不坐下来接受停战的谈判。这一事实证明了世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义也是完全可以打败的，从而坚定了各国人民斗争的信心，鼓舞了各国人民斗争的意志，并且彻底地粉碎了美帝国主义无敌的神话。
    第二次世界大战以后，世界各国人民反对帝国主义斗争的无数经验也一再说明，对于美帝国主义这样一个最凶恶的敌人和其他的殖民主义者，决不能抱有任何不切实际的幻想，而必须同它进行针锋相对的斗争。这就是当它进行战争威慑和发动侵略战争的时候，我们一定要敢于进行反击，不要被它吓倒；当它玩弄和平阴谋的时候，我们一定要善于识别和揭穿它的虚伪手法，不要上它的圈套。
    十五年来，斗争的风暴一天比一天猛烈。今天，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民斗争的风暴已震撼了整个世界。帝国主义任意蹂躏亚、非、拉丁美洲的日子，已经一去不复返了。整个形势对于各国人民争取独立的斗争十分有利。在人类的历史上已经揭开了新的一页，形势的发展完全说明，我们的时代是和平力量压倒战争力量，人民力量压倒反动力量，社会主义力量压倒帝国主义力量的时代。我们现在正处在东风继续压倒西风的时代。广大的觉悟的人民，已经从长时期被剥削、榨取和奴役中接受了血的教训，找出了新的办法去抵制反动的武装优势，而取得自己的胜利。
    毛主席说得好：“世界和平的取得，主要依靠各国人民的斗争”，“人民是决定的因素，依靠人民的团结和斗争，必能战胜帝国主义和他们的走狗，取得世界的持久和平。”过去十五年的历史完全证明了这话的正确，将来的十五年以至更长的历史还会不断证明。
