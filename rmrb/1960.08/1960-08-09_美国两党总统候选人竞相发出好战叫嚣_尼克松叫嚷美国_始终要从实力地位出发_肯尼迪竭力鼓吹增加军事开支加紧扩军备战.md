Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Honolulu Dispatch: U.S. presidential candidates from both parties, in recent campaign speeches, are vying to advocate escalating the “Cold War” and preparing for a hot war.

The incumbent Vice President and Republican presidential candidate, Nixon, clamored in Honolulu on the 5th that American diplomatic actions "must always proceed from a position of strength."

Nixon went there on the 3rd for a two-day campaign trip.

In his speech on the 5th, he clamored that the United States must build up a military force that exceeds "any potential enemy," and that the United States must be "firm" when dealing with other countries.

This "Cold War" knight stated that if he were elected president, he would more directly supervise and intensify the implementation of the United States' "Cold War" policy. He said, "The president must directly assume the task of controlling and directing the world struggle."

Nixon indicated that the United States should intensify its use of the United Nations to promote its aggressive policies and intensify the patching together of so-called "regional international organizations," that is, various aggressive blocs. He also clamored that the United States should transform its so-called foreign "aid" programs into "an ideological striking force."

When answering reporters' questions on the 4th, he also advocated that the United States should continue to use Japan to promote its aggressive policies in the Far East. He said that Japan is the key to the so-called "free world" Pacific system, and that if the United States loses its dominance in the Pacific, its position in Europe will be "dangerous and possibly unsustainable."

Nixon clamored that the United States cannot be "discouraged" by the failures it has suffered in Japan.

Nixon reiterated the old tune of hostility towards China, saying that recognizing China is not in the so-called "interests of peace and freedom" of the United States, and may cause the entire Asia to "fall into the orbit of communism." Nixon also clamored that the United States should use so-called "ideological exchanges" to corrupt and infiltrate socialist countries. He clamored that the United States "must do much, much more in this regard" and "must be more imaginative." In a speech, Nixon reiterated his ambition to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and establish American dominance over the world, clamoring that the United States cannot merely hold the "line of defense against communism," but should bring so-called "freedom" to what he calls "enslaved countries." He clamored, "In this great battle between the forces of enslavement and the forces of freedom, we must go forward to win this battle."

The Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy also advocated increasing military spending to accelerate military expansion and arms race during a campaign event in New York on the 5th. He particularly cheered the U.S. government's plan to build more submarines capable of launching "Polaris" missiles, and urged increased funding to develop U.S. military forces. He clamored, "I think it is useful to put some effort in this area (increasing military spending), especially in Polaris submarines."

    美国两党总统候选人竞相发出好战叫嚣
    尼克松叫嚷美国“始终要从实力地位出发”  肯尼迪竭力鼓吹增加军事开支加紧扩军备战
    新华社6日讯　檀香山消息：美国两党总统候选人在最近的竞选演说中竞相鼓吹加剧“冷战”和准备热战。
    现任副总统的共和党总统候选人尼克松，5日在檀香山鼓吹美国的外交行动“始终要从实力地位出发”。
    尼克松是在3日到那里去作为期两天的竞选旅行的。
    他在5日的演说里叫嚷美国必须建立起超过“任何潜在的敌人”的军事力量，美国在同其他国家打交道时要“坚定”。
    这个“冷战”骑士表示，如果他当选为总统的话，他要更加直接督导加紧推行美国的“冷战”政策。他说，“总统必须直接担负起控制和指挥世界斗争的”工作。
    尼克松表示美国要加紧利用联合国推行其侵略政策并加紧拼凑所谓“区域性的国际组织”，即各种侵略集团。他还叫嚣美国要把它的所谓对外“援助”计划变为“一支意识形态的打击力量”。
    他在4日回答记者问题的时候还鼓吹美国要继续利用日本来推行其在远东的侵略政策，他说日本是所谓“自由世界”太平洋体系的关键，而如果美国失去了在太平洋的支配权，那么它在欧洲的地位将是“危险的，并且可能是维持不住的”。
    尼克松叫嚣美国不能因为在日本遭到的失败而“气馁”。
    尼克松重弹敌视中国的老调，说什么承认中国不符合美国的所谓“和平和自由的利益”，并且可能会使整个亚洲“落入共产党的轨道”。尼克松还叫嚣美国要通过所谓“思想交流”来对社会主义国家进行腐蚀和渗透。他鼓吹美国“必须在这方面做更加多得多的工作”，并且“必须更富有想像力”。尼克松在一篇演说中重申干涉别国内政和建立美国一统天下的野心，叫嚷美国不能仅仅守住“抵御共产主义的战线”，而应该把所谓“自由”带给他所说的“被奴役国家”。他叫嚷说，“在奴役的力量和自由的力量进行的这场大战中，我们必须走向前去赢得这场战斗。”
    民主党总统候选人肯尼迪5日在纽约进行竞选活动时也鼓吹增加军事开支来加紧扩军备战。他特别欢呼美国政府增建能发射“北极星”式导弹的潜艇的计划，并且敦促增加更多经费来发展美国军事力量。他叫嚷说，“我认为，在这一方面（增加军事开支）、特别是在北极星潜艇方面加一把劲，是有用处的”。
