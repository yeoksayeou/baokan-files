Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, August 23rd: According to TASS, the Soviet representative to the Three-Nation Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests, Zorin, accused the United States on the 22nd of obstructing progress in the negotiations.

At the meeting that day, Zorin pointed out that the Three-Nation Conference had lasted for twenty-two months, with two hundred and forty-six sessions held, and had failed to complete the task it had undertaken. The reason for this was not the "technical difficulties" that the American representative used as an excuse, but rather the influence of militarist forces who consistently and stubbornly opposed the prohibition of all nuclear weapon tests.

Zorin also pointed out that the United States and British delegations proposed that the conference be adjourned until September 27th of this year. He said that the Soviet government hoped to prevent any interruption of the conference, but since the British and American delegations had proposed an adjournment, the Soviet Union would not object.

    苏联代表指责美国阻挠谈判
    美英要求停止核试验会议休会
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：苏联出席三国不继续核试验会议的代表查拉普金22日指责美国阻挠谈判获得进展。
    查拉普金在这一天的会议上指出，三国会议进行了二十二个月，举行了二百四十六次会议，都未能完成它所承担的任务，其原因并不是美国代表在这里所借口的“技术困难”，而是由于一贯顽固地反对禁止一切核武器试验的军国主义势力的影响。
    查拉普金还指出，美国和英国代表团建议会议休会到今年的9月27日。他说，苏联政府希望使会议不致有任何中断，但是既然英国和美国代表团建议休会，苏联将不反对。
