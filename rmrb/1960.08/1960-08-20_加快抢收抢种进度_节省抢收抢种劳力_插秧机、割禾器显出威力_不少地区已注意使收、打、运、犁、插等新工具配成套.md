(By our staff reporter) Rice transplanters, rice harvesters, and rice threshers and other new tools have played a huge role in the rush harvesting and planting in the southern provinces, greatly accelerating the progress of the "double抢" (rush harvesting and planting).

Harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice are the busiest seasons in the double-cropping rice areas of the South. Both harvesting and transplanting must seize the "right moment." In this year's "double抢", the southern provinces widely promoted the use of new tools. According to statistics, during this "double抢", Hunan Province promoted the use of 180,000 rapid rice harvesters, more than 76,000 rice threshers, and 110,000 rice transplanters. In Chenzhou Prefecture, more than 40% of the paddy fields were harvested and transplanted using harvesters, threshers, and transplanters. By mid-July, Fujian Province had used harvesters to harvest more than 100,000 mu of early rice and rice transplanters to transplant 1,150,000 mu of late rice. In addition to promoting more than 60,000 harvesters for harvesting early rice, Zhejiang also promoted more than 1.8 million highly efficient large sickles. In addition, the province also manufactured more than 170,000 rice transplanters of various models and more than 16,000 seedling pullers. Calculated according to the province's area for continuous late rice sowing, there is an average of one rice transplanter for every 68 mu. In Guangxi, many counties have machine-transplanted areas accounting for more than 50% of the late rice already transplanted, with some counties reaching more than 80%. Guizhou, Sichuan, and other provinces have also promoted the use of a large number of new tools, with the promotion of rice transplanters being more common in Guizhou and the promotion of rice threshers being more common in Sichuan.

These new tools have greatly accelerated the progress of "double抢" in various places and saved labor. This year, Ningming County, Guangxi, widely used rice transplanters to rush-transplant late rice, which was not only faster than last year but also saved tens of thousands of workdays. This year, Ningming County planted more late rice than last year, but the labor invested in transplanting was less than last year, which was solved by promoting the use of rice transplanters. In the high-efficiency, high-quality movement of "double抢" in Wuhu Prefecture, Anhui, more than 2.24 million pieces of advanced tools for harvesting, land preparation, fertilization, and transplanting were vigorously promoted, and the harvesting of early rice and the transplanting of late rice were accelerated by 23% to 51% respectively compared with last year. Ji'an area in Jiangxi also guaranteed the early completion of the "double抢" task due to the vigorous promotion of rapid harvesters, rice threshers, and rice transplanters.

In the process of promoting the use of these tools, most of the southern regions conducted meticulous organization and preparation work in advance. Zhejiang trained more than 350,000 rice transplanter operators in advance. During the "double抢", it also selected outstanding new agricultural implement operators from various places to form promotion teams to pass on their experience and knowledge to various places. The relevant departments in Jiangxi Province also organized rice transplanter promotion work teams to go to the countryside to publicize the superiority of rice transplanters and help farmers solve technical problems in using and repairing rice transplanters. Hunan Province launched the "Thousands of Teachers and Tens of Thousands of Apprentices" and "One Old and Ten New" movements, training a large number of female rice transplanter, harvester, and thresher operators.

Facts have proved that to promote the use of highly efficient new tools, it is necessary to carefully train in the technology of their use so that they reach a proficient level. Only in this way will the masses be willing to use them, and the efficiency will be high. In some places, the new tools manufactured were not fully utilized because technical training did not keep up. In addition, many places have also paid attention to matching tools for harvesting, threshing, transportation, drying, storage, plowing, and transplanting into sets, and organizing assembly line operations to further exert the power of these new tools.

    加快抢收抢种进度　节省抢收抢种劳力
    插秧机、割禾器显出威力
    不少地区已注意使收、打、运、犁、插等新工具配成套
    本报讯　插秧机、割禾器和打稻机等新工具，在南方各省区的抢收抢种中发挥了巨大的作用，大大加快了“双抢”的进度。
    收打早稻和栽插晚稻是南方双季稻区最繁忙的季节。收和插都要抢“火候”。今年“双抢”中，南方各省区都较广泛地推广使用了新工具。据统计，这次“双抢”，湖南省推广使用的快速割禾器达十八万部、打稻机七万六千多部，插秧机十一万部，郴州专区有40％以上的稻田是用收割器、打稻机和插秧机收、插的。福建省到7月中旬统计，使用割禾器收割早稻十万多亩，用插秧机栽插晚稻达一百一十五万亩。浙江这次收早稻除推广了六万多部割禾器外，还推广了一百八十多万把效率较高的大镰刀。此外全省还制造了各种型号插秧机十七万多部，各式拨秧器一万六千多部。按全省连作晚稻播种面积计算，平均每六十八亩就有一部插秧机。广西已插晚稻中，有许多县机插面积都在50％以上，有的县占到80％以上。贵州、四川等省也推广使用了大量的新工具，贵州推广插秧机较普遍，四川推广打稻机较多。
    这些新工具大大加快了各地“双抢”的进度，节约了劳力。广西宁明县今年广泛使用插秧机抢插晚稻，不仅插得比去年快，而且节约了十几万个劳动日。宁明县今年种晚稻比去年多而投入栽插的劳力却比去年少，推广使用插秧机才解决了这个问题。安徽芜湖专区在“双抢”高工效高质量运动中，大力推广了收割、整田、施肥、栽插等先进工具二百二十四万多件，早稻收割和晚稻栽插分别比去年加快了23％到51％。江西吉安地区也由于大力推广了快速收割器、打稻机和插秧机，才保证“双抢”任务提前完成。
    南方各地在推广使用这些工具过程中，大都事先进行了细致的组织和准备工作。浙江事先训练了三十五万多名插秧机手，“双抢”中还选拔各地优秀的新式农具手组成推广团，到各地传经送宝。江西省也由有关部门组织了插秧机推广工作团，下乡向农民宣传插秧机的优越性、帮助农民解决使用和修理插秧机的技术问题。湖南省开展了“千师万徒”“一老十新”运动，训练了大量的妇女插秧机、割禾器和打稻机操作手。
    事实证明，推广使用效率高的新工具，必须认真训练使用技术，使之达到熟练的程度。只有这样，群众才乐于使用，效率才高。有些地方就因为技术训练没有跟上，以致制造的新工具没有完全使用起来。此外，不少地方还注意使收、打、运、晒、藏、犁、插等工具的配成套，和组织流水作业的问题，进一步发挥这些新工具的威力。
