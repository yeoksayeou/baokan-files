    Seizing the Rainy Season, Combining with Field Management
    Sichuan Vigorously Carries Out Water Storage and Conservation Work

    (Our report) Sichuan Province, guided by the spirit of "Looking at the next season from the first, and looking at next year from this year," while focusing on current production, is utilizing the experience of capturing timeliness in water storage and maintaining consistency in water conservation. They are closely combining field management with flood prevention and drought resistance efforts, launching a surge in water storage and conservation.

    In order to seize the current rainy season and promptly store enough water for next year's spring irrigation and early spring planting, various localities, under the guidance of the idea that "time is strength, water storage is grain storage," are conscientiously mobilizing and organizing the masses. They are promptly preparing and taking action early, enabling water storage and conservation work to quickly achieve considerable results. Under the action slogan of "Don't wait for the last rain," the Neijiang Special District has quickly repaired more than 4,700 water storage projects and plastered more than 44,000 field ridges. By August 11, 67% of the ponds and 84% of the stone weirs were full of water. In the Yibin Special District, many ponds and reservoirs had dried up before mid-July. However, thanks to the leadership's timely focus on water storage and conservation work, as soon as it rained heavily, the secretaries took the lead in a crash effort to store water. Currently, after meeting the water needs for late rice planting, 84% of the river weirs, 67% of the ponds, and 36% of the reservoirs are full of water. The Mianyang Special District, which acted early and focused intently, has achieved remarkable results, with the water storage capacity of ponds and reservoirs throughout the district increasing by 20% to 30% compared to the same period last year.

    In this water storage and conservation work, many areas have paid attention to conscientiously summarizing the successful experiences of the masses in water storage and conservation over the years. Starting from the characteristics of different regions, they have adopted many effective water storage methods. In hilly areas, the masses, based on the characteristics of steep slopes, small and scattered soil, and insufficient catchment areas for some ponds and reservoirs, have adopted measures such as digging ditches along the mountains to divert water and expand the catchment area. This not only avoids the phenomenon of turbulent rainwater but also rapidly increases the amount of water stored. In many areas, the masses have also used methods such as building dams across streams and rivers and developing inter-row water storage fields to try every means to increase water storage.

    While vigorously grasping water storage and conservation work, various localities have also conscientiously combined flood prevention, drought resistance, and field management work. They have taken many effective measures that both benefit and eliminate drawbacks, both storing enough water for the next season and preventing current crops from suffering from drought and flood disasters. Shehong County conducted a comprehensive inspection of all water storage projects in the county in advance, and carefully planned and calculated each project based on its quality, water source, and storage capacity. They formulated water storage methods and requirements for each project, so that cadres and the masses have a clear understanding, combining drought prevention and flood control. This not only ensured the safety of the projects during the flood season but also continuously increased water storage. The Honghua Management District of the Wufeng Commune in Jintang County, located in a hilly area, closely combined field management, contracting all six hundred fertilizer pits and thirty water storage ponds to households. They mobilized commune members to block water when it rained and divert water into the pits and ponds, so that the entire management district will no longer have to fetch water from afar when applying fertilizer to late-maturing crops and late autumn crops in the future. This not only saves labor but also speeds up the progress of topdressing. It is estimated that each fertilizer application can save more than 2,360 workdays, equivalent to the workload of all labor for seven days.

    Currently, all parts of the province are further strengthening leadership, establishing and improving the responsibility system, and taking advantage of the current favorable rainy season to continue to vigorously grasp water storage and conservation, striving to achieve greater success in water storage and conservation work in the shortest possible time.

### 抓紧多雨季节  结合田间管理  四川大搞蓄水保水工作

    抓紧多雨季节  结合田间管理
    四川大搞蓄水保水工作
    本报讯　四川省各地本着“头季看下季，今年看明年”的精神，在抓紧抓好当前生产的同时，正运用蓄水抓及时、保水抓经常的经验，紧密结合田间管理和防洪、抗旱工作，掀起一个蓄水保水的热潮。
    为了抓紧当前多雨季节，及时动手为明年小春春灌和大春栽种蓄足用水，各地都在“时间就是力量，蓄水就是蓄粮”的思想指导下，认真动员和组织群众，及时准备，及早行动，使蓄水保水工作迅速取得了不小成绩。内江专区各地在“莫等最后一场雨”的行动口号下，全区很快就整修好四千七百多处蓄水工程，捶糊好四万四千多条田坎，到8月11日已有67％的塘和84％的石堰蓄满了水。宜宾专区在7月中旬以前许多塘库水已枯竭，但由于领导上及时地抓紧了蓄水保水工作，一下大雨，就由书记带头进行突击蓄水，目前，在满足了晚稻栽插用水后，还有84％的河堰、67％的塘和36％的库蓄满了水。动得早、抓得紧的绵阳专区，成绩十分显著，全区塘库蓄水量已比去年同期增长了20％到30％。
    在这次蓄水保水工作中，许多地区都注意了认真总结群众历年来蓄水保水的成功经验，从不同地区的特点出发，采取了许多有效的蓄水方法。在丘陵地区的群众，根据丘陵地区坡度大、土块小而分散、一些塘库集雨面积不足等特点，采取了沿山开沟引水，扩大集雨面积的措施，既避免了雨水乱流的现象，又迅速地增加了蓄水量。在许多地区，群众还利用溪河拦河扎堰以及发展插花囤水田等方法，千方百计增蓄水量。
    各地在狠抓蓄水保水的工作中，还认真地结合了防洪、抗旱和田间管理工作，采取了许多既兴利又除弊、既为下一季蓄足用水又使当季作物不受旱涝灾害的有效措施。射洪县在事先就对全县蓄水工程普遍作了检查，按工程质量、水源、库容认真地进行了规划和计算，分别作出了每个工程的蓄水办法和要求，使干部群众心中有数，防旱防洪结合，既保证了洪水期中工程的安全，蓄水量也不断上升。地处丘陵地区的金堂五凤公社红花管区，紧密结合田间管理，把六百多个粪坑和三十多个囤水氹全部包干到户，发动社员趁雨堵水，引水入坑氹，使全管区今后给大春迟熟作物和晚秋作物追肥时，不再从远处去挑水，既节约了劳力，又能加快追肥进度。据计算，施肥一次，就能省工二千三百六十多个，相当于全部劳力七天的工作量。
    目前，全省各地正在进一步加强领导，建立和健全责任制度，利用当前多雨的有利时机，继续狠抓蓄水保水，力争在最短期内，使蓄水保水工作取得更大的成绩。
