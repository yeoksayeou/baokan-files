Xinhua News Agency, 22nd - The National Committee of the Chinese Mechanical Workers' Union held a get-together this evening to warmly welcome the Japanese Central Metal Joint Struggle Council Delegation headed by Sakao Masuo.

At the gathering, Yu Huan, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Mechanical Workers' Union, delivered a speech welcoming the Japanese friends and wishing the Japanese people and workers greater victories in their future struggles. He said that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people and workers. The Chinese people and workers have vigorously supported the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people and workers against the United States in the past, and will continue to vigorously support the just struggle of the Japanese people and workers in the future.

Sakao Masuo, head of the Japanese Central Metal Joint Struggle Council Delegation, spoke, warmly thanking the Chinese people for their support of the Japanese people's just struggle. He said that the support of the Chinese people has strengthened the will and confidence of the Japanese people. He gave a detailed account of the Japanese people's patriotic struggle against the United States, pointing out that the broad masses of Japanese workers have always stood at the forefront of the struggle. He said that the victory of the Japanese people's struggle once again shows the people of the world that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger. He said that in the struggle, the Japanese people have deeply realized that against the despicable conspiracies and violence of imperialism, one cannot rely solely on parliamentary struggle. The people must have their own strength, especially the working class must become the core of the struggle and carry out the struggle as organizers.

He pointed out that the Japanese people are not satisfied with the victories already achieved, and the struggle has only just begun, because the number of U.S. military bases in Japan has not decreased by one, and like China's Taiwan, Japan's territory of Okinawa is still occupied by the United States. We have not yet driven the U.S. troops out of Okinawa. He said that although there are still difficulties on the road of struggle, the Japanese people, led by the Japanese working class, will continue the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, demanding that the United States withdraw its military bases in Japan, return Okinawa to Japan, demand the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, and drive imperialism out of the Pacific. He said that the people of all countries should unite and carry out a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism.

In his speech, the head of the delegation also warmly congratulated the Chinese people on the great achievements they have made in the Great Leap Forward, and wished friendship and unity between the Japanese and Chinese people.

The head of the delegation's words were warmly welcomed by hundreds of employees who attended the get-together.

Li Yunchuan, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Mechanical Workers' Union, and He Ruilin, Vice-Chairman, also attended the get-together.

At the get-together, guests and hosts enjoyed artistic performances and danced.

    我机械工会和日本友人联欢
    宾主一致强调要加强团结坚决同美帝国主义斗争
    新华社22日讯　中国机械工会全国委员会今晚举行联欢会，热烈欢迎以坂尾增雄为首的日本中央金属共斗会议访华代表团。
    中国机械工会全国委员会副主席于桓在联欢会上致词欢迎日本朋友，祝日本人民和工人在今后的斗争中获得更大的胜利。他说，美帝国主义是中日两国人民和工人的共同敌人，中国人民和工人过去大力支持日本人民和工人的反美爱国正义斗争，今后仍将继续大力支持日本人民和工人的正义斗争。
    日本中央金属共斗会议访华代表团团长坂尾增雄讲话，他热烈感谢中国人民对日本人民正义斗争的支持。他说，中国人民的支持增强了日本人民的意志和信心。他详细介绍了日本人民进行反美爱国斗争的情况，指出日本广大工人一直站在斗争的最前列。他说，日本人民斗争胜利的事实，再一次向全世界人民说明美帝国主义是纸老虎。他说，日本人民在斗争中，深刻地体会到，对卑鄙的帝国主义的阴谋和暴力，不能单凭议会斗争，人民要有自己的力量，特别是工人阶级要成为斗争的核心，作为组织者进行斗争。
    他指出，日本人民并不满足于已经取得的胜利，斗争只不过是刚刚开始，因为美国在日本的军事基地一个也没有减少，同中国的台湾一样，日本的领土冲绳还被美国霸占着，我们还没有把美国军队从冲绳赶走。他表示，尽管在斗争的道路上还有困难，但以日本工人阶级为首的日本人民将继续反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，要求美国撤退它在日本的军事基地，把冲绳归还日本，要求恢复日中邦交，把帝国主义从太平洋赶出去。他说，各国人民应该团结起来，同美帝国主义作坚决的斗争。
    团长在讲话中还热烈祝贺中国人民在大跃进中取得的伟大成就，祝日中两国人民友好和团结。
    团长的话受到了参加联欢晚会的数百名职工的热烈欢迎。
    中国机械工会全国委员会主席李云川、副主席贺瑞林也出席了联欢晚会。
    在联欢会上宾主一起欣赏了艺术表演，并且跳交谊舞。
