A Contribution to Increased Steel Production

    Give the Green Light to Key Equipment
    Zhang Weishan, Head of the Planning and Production Section, Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant
    There is always a sense of priority, primary and secondary, important and less important, urgent and less urgent, in everything. Our mechanical industry workers must provide more and better equipment for the steel, coal, transportation and other departments. We must also implement the principle of "Nation before local, key before general" in production arrangements, and prioritize ensuring these key products.
    Looking at our factory's production tasks, the products produced for mining and metallurgical enterprises account for the largest proportion, which is a key task arranged by the state. At the same time, there are also tasks arranged by local authorities and some temporary orders. For all these tasks, there is no doubt that we must give full play to our subjective initiative and do our best to ensure completion within the possible range. However, when arranging production plans, we must distinguish between primary and secondary, and concentrate our efforts to ensure key products first. From the current point of view, it is necessary to prioritize the products closely related to the continued leap forward in steel, coal, and transportation industries arranged by the state, and give priority guarantees in terms of manpower, materials, and equipment; on the premise of ensuring key points, comprehensively arrange various products.
    Our factory has a heavy production task in the second half of this year, especially in the third quarter. In order to ensure the comprehensive completion of the key equipment needed by the steel and coal industries, in addition to mobilizing the masses of workers to carry out technical revolution on a large scale, our factory has recently conducted a comprehensive inspection of the order contracts for the second half of the year, re-ranked them, and put the key products urgently needed by the central government to increase steel and coal production in front of the plan. Manpower, materials, etc. are also given priority to meet the needs of these products. I think this arrangement is correct.

### 为重点设备大开绿灯

    为重点设备大开绿灯
    沈阳矿山机器厂计划生产科科长　张维善
    什么事情总有先后、主次、轻重、缓急之分。我们机械工业职工要为钢铁、煤、运等部门提供更多更好的设备，也必须在生产安排上贯彻“先国家后地方，先重点后一般”的原则，优先确保这些重点产品。
    从我们工厂的生产任务来看，为矿山、冶金企业生产的产品，比重最大，这是国家安排的重点任务。同时也有地方安排的任务和一些临时的定货。对于所有这些任务，毫无疑问，我们要充分发挥主观能动性，在可能范围内，尽最大努力保证完成。但在安排生产计划时，必须分清主次，分清先后，集中力量首先保证重点产品。从目前看，就是要对国家安排的同钢铁、煤、运持续跃进有密切关系的产品，在人力、材料、设备等方面给以优先保证；在保证重点的前提下，对各种产品进行全面安排。
    我们厂今年下半年的生产任务很重，特别是第三季度任务更重。为了保证全面完成钢铁、煤炭工业所需要的重点设备，我们厂除了发动职工群众大搞技术革命以外，最近又对下半年的订货合同普遍进行了一次检查，并重新排了队，把中央下达的增产钢铁、煤炭所急需的重点产品，都排在计划的前面，人力、材料等也都尽先满足这些产品的需要。我认为这样安排是正确的。
