Xinhua News Agency dispatch: To ensure a bumper harvest of grain, vegetables, and various crops next year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is composting more green manure this year than in previous years. Many people's communes recognize that green manure has good fertilizer effect and composting is labor-saving and inexpensive. They are seizing the favorable time of hot weather and rainy season to promptly arrange labor, organize professional teams, and mobilize the masses to vigorously compost green manure. In Aohan Banner, Zhaowuda League, which has achieved good results, they put forward the slogan of "one pit, ten carts, and ten thousand catties per person," and launched a competition among teams and households to press green manure. Cai Ji'erhu, the First Secretary of the Aohan Banner Party Committee, led cadres and masses to accumulate fertilizer when it rained. Recently, more than 21,000 people from eleven communes in this banner have participated in fertilizer accumulation.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Gansu Province has launched a summer fertilizer accumulation upsurge by combining temporary crash programs with long-term construction methods. The fertilizer accumulated and produced in the four special districts and autonomous prefectures of Tianshui, Pingliang, Dingxi, and Linxia has been used to topdress more than half of the autumn fields, and the high-yield fields and third-class fields have been topdressed more than twice.

Currently, in addition to the professional fertilizer accumulation and production teams consisting of more than 540,000 people who are persisting in their year-round work, various special districts have also organized the masses to carry out crash fertilizer accumulation in conjunction with mid-cultivation and weeding. The people's communes in the Hexi Corridor are transferring labor and livestock to form professional green harvesting teams to collect various wild plants such as bitter beans and camel thorns on the Gobi Desert for composting green manure. In terms of basic fertilizer construction, various places are launching a new upsurge in pig raising, striving to raise more pigs and accumulate more fertilizer. At the same time, various places are actively rectifying and improving local chemical fertilizer plants from the organizational, technical, and production aspects to enable them to produce more local chemical fertilizer.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Henan Province is accumulating fertilizer while topdressing. Late autumn crops have been topdressed on 45 million mu, and early autumn crops have been topdressed twice on 14 million mu. At present, the fertilizer accumulation and production movement is still continuing. The commune members are striving to apply another 3,000 to 4,000 catties of topdressing fertilizer per mu to summer-sown crops and prepare 4,000 catties of base fertilizer per mu for autumn-sown crops.

In order to strive for an autumn harvest, the Henan Provincial Party Committee issued "Instructions on launching a large-scale mass fertilizer accumulation, production, and topdressing movement" at the end of July. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, various localities, on the one hand, vigorously compost green manure in conjunction with mid-cultivation and weeding; on the other hand, fixed labor, organized professional teams, and carried out multi-pronged fertilizer accumulation and production movement. At present, the labor force invested in fertilizer accumulation and production has reached 5.1 million people.

    为秋田赶积追肥　为秋种准备基肥
    内蒙古甘肃河南大积大造肥料
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区为保证明年粮食、蔬菜和各种农作物丰收，今年沤积的绿肥比往年都多。很多人民公社认识到绿肥肥效好，沤肥又省工便宜，都抓紧热天、雨季有利时机，及时安排劳力，组织专业队伍，发动群众大沤绿肥。成绩较好的昭乌达盟敖汉旗，提出每人一坑、十车、双万斤的口号，展开队队户户压绿肥的竞赛。中共敖汉旗委第一书记才吉尔乎碰上雨天，就带领干部和群众一起积肥。最近，这个旗十一个公社参加积肥的人已有二万一千多人。
    据新华社讯　甘肃省采用临时突击和长远建设相结合的方法掀起了夏季积肥高潮。天水、平凉、定西、临夏四个专区和自治州积造的肥料，已给一半以上的秋田施了追肥，其中丰产田、三类田已追肥两次以上。
    目前，全省除有由五十四万多人组成的积肥造肥专业队在坚持常年工作外，各专区还组织群众结合中耕锄草突击积肥。河西走廊各人民公社，正抽调劳力、畜力组成采青专业队，在戈壁滩上采集苦豆子、骆驼蓬等多种野生植物沤制绿肥。在肥料基本建设方面，各地正掀起养猪新高潮，力争多养猪多积肥。各地同时对土化肥厂积极从组织上、技术上、生产上进行整顿提高，使其生产更多土化肥。
    据新华社讯　河南省边积肥边追肥，晚秋作物已追肥四千五百万亩，早秋作物已有一千四百万亩追肥两遍。现在，积肥造肥运动仍继续进行，社员们力争夏播作物每亩再施追肥三千斤到四千斤，并为秋播作物每亩备足底肥四千斤。
    为了争取秋季丰收，河南省委于7月底就发出了“开展大规模的群众性的积肥造肥追肥运动的指示”。各地根据省委指示，一方面结合中耕锄草大沤绿肥；一方面固定劳力，组织专业队，开展多头多路的积肥造肥运动。目前，投入积肥造肥的劳力已达五百一十万人。
