Seize the Peak Crop Growth Period, Increase Management Measures:
    Fifty-Pu Production Team Launches Overproduction Competition;
    First-Class Fields Receive Continuous Attention, Second and Third-Class Fields Undergo Crash Weeding and Topdressing to Catch Up
    [Our Dispatch] The Fifty-Pu Production Team of the Gan-Gou People's Commune in Huining County, Gansu, has, based on summarizing the previous stage of production work, seized the current favorable opportunity to organize each production team to launch an autumn field overproduction competition, striving for an abundant autumn harvest.

    The Fifty-Pu Production Team's Party branch first conducted a thorough assessment and ranking of all autumn fields in the team and mobilized the masses to summarize the experience and measures of the previous stage of drought resistance and seedling protection. Through in-depth publicity and conscientious implementation of policies, the contract output targets were implemented, further encouraging the production enthusiasm of the masses. In order to manage the autumn fields meticulously and well, processing them to the end, and strive for a bumper autumn harvest, members were immediately organized to conduct discussions, add measures, and launch a competition to achieve actual output exceeding the contracted output. According to the different growth conditions of the autumn fields, specific measures were adopted according to local conditions and crops: For first-class fields, in the spirit of making good even better, meticulous management was carried out, with continuous processing. Combined with mid-tillage and weeding, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers, ash, and farm manure were applied. High-stalk crops such as millet and sorghum were earthed up to prevent lodging. Ash and tobacco water were applied to prevent late-stage pests and diseases, striving to ensure that every plant has no empty ears and every ear has no shriveled grains. For second and third-class fields, after rationally arranging the labor force, the superior forces were concentrated in the mountain, highland, and high-altitude areas to launch a crash weeding and topdressing with mixed phosphorus and potassium chemical fertilizers and farm manure to promote seedling growth and attack the plants and ears, resolutely eliminating third-class fields.

    In the autumn field overproduction competition, the production team's Party branch adopted the method of grasping both ends to lead the middle, especially strengthening the specific leadership of the third-class field work, organizing production team and production brigade cadres and Party members to be responsible for contracting, carrying it through to the end, grasping the measures firmly, and leading the overproduction competition activities well. In addition, thirty-four strong laborers were drawn from breeding and living welfare aspects, and immediately invested in field production, to ensure that 80% of the team's labor force was used in the fields. After the labor force was concentrated in each team, labor management was strengthened, so that every front had leadership and every job had a quota; at the same time, cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers were also organized to go to the fields every day for acceptance and comparison, inserting red flags and setting up pace-setters, stimulating the production enthusiasm of the members, and accelerating the progress and improving the quality of autumn field weeding and topdressing.

    抓紧作物盛长时期增添管理措施
    五十铺生产队开展超产竞赛
    一类田加工不停，二三类田突击锄草追肥迎头赶上
    本报讯　甘肃会宁县甘沟人民公社五十铺生产队，在总结前一段生产工作的基础上，抓紧目前有利时机，组织各生产小队开展秋田超产竞赛运动，争取秋收多多益善。
    五十铺生产队党支部首先对全队的秋田进行了摸底排队，并发动群众总结了前一段抗旱保苗的经验和措施，通过深入宣传和认真贯彻政策，落实了包产指标，进一步鼓励了群众的生产积极性。为了把秋田管细、管好，加工到底，争取秋收多多益善，立即组织社员开展讨论，增添措施，开展了实产超包产的竞赛运动。根据秋田生长的不同情况，因地、因作物制宜，采取了具体措施：对一类田，本着好上加好的精神，细致管理，加工不停，结合中耕锄草，增施磷钾肥、草木灰、厩肥等，对糜、谷等高秆作物进行培土，防止倒伏，施用草木灰、烟叶水防治晚期病虫害，力争株株无空穗，穗穗无秕粒。对二、三类田，在合理安排劳动力以后，把优势力量集中到山塬丘陵和高山地区，突击锄草，追施磷钾混合化肥、厩肥等，促苗生长，攻株攻穗，坚决消灭三类田。
    在秋田超产竞赛运动中，生产队党支部采取抓两头带中间的办法，特别加强了对三类田工作的具体领导，组织生产队、生产小队干部和党员负责包干，一包到底，狠抓措施，领导好超产竞赛活动。另外，还从饲养和生活福利等方面抽出三十四名强壮劳动力，立即投入田间生产，保证了全队80％的劳动力用于田间。各小队在劳动力集中以后，加强了劳动管理，做到了条条战线有领导，项项活计有定额；同时，还组织干部、技术员、老农每天上地头验收评比，插红旗，树标兵，激发了社员的生产积极性，加快了秋田锄草、追肥的进度，提高了质量。
