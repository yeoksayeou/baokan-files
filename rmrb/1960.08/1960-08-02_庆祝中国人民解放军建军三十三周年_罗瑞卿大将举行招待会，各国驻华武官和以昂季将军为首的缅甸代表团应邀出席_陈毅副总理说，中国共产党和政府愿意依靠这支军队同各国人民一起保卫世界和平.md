Xinhua News Agency, 1st August. General Luo Ruiqing, Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, held a reception at the Great Hall of the People tonight to celebrate the 33rd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the reception and spoke at the reception.

General Luo Ruiqing said in his speech that we are very pleased to be able to celebrate this festival with representatives of the armed forces of socialist countries and friendly countries, and the Burmese representatives of the Sino-Burmese Joint Border Committee headed by General Aung Gyi.

General Luo Ruiqing said that for thirty-three years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese People's Army has overcome the attacks of powerful enemies at home and abroad and won the victory of the Chinese revolutionary war. Now, it is continuing to advance towards the goal of strengthening revolutionization and accelerating modernization, and is shouldering the glorious task of defending the motherland, defending the Far East, and defending world peace.

He said that we are a socialist country, and our social system determines that we love peace. In the relations between countries, we have always advocated peaceful coexistence, and we are willing to establish friendly and cooperative relations with all peace-loving countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The recent negotiations with the Burmese government on the border issue, which achieved a comprehensive, fair and reasonable solution, are a good example. However, the war group headed by US imperialism is stepping up arms expansion and war preparations, constantly carrying out provocative activities, and is hostile to the people of the world. Therefore, we must not relax our vigilance, and we must not harbor any unrealistic illusions about the most ferocious enemy—US imperialism. We will never be intimidated by any provocations or threats from imperialism, and we will never beg imperialism for peace. If imperialism dares to impose war on us, we will resolutely fight back. We firmly believe that in the face of the Chinese people, in the face of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and in the face of peace-loving people all over the world, imperialism daring to launch a war of aggression will be shamefully and completely defeated!

On behalf of the Ministry of National Defense and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, General Luo Ruiqing expressed his warm welcome and gratitude to the military attachés of various countries and other distinguished guests such as General Aung Gyi who attended today's reception. He proposed a toast to the glorious festival of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to the friendship between the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the armies of all friendly countries, to the fraternal friendship and unity between the armies of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, to the health of the military attachés of various countries present and the Burmese friends headed by General Aung Gyi, and to lasting peace in Asia and the world.

Colonel Rak, the military attaché of Czechoslovakia to China, said in his speech on behalf of the military attachés of various countries in China that the thirty-three-year history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a glorious and arduous history. From the day it was founded in 1927, it has gone through thousands of battles, smashed the enemy's blockades, endured hunger, disease and unbearable pain during the Long March, and defeated the feudal bureaucrats, the Japanese invaders, the millions of troops of the Chinese reactionaries, and armed invaders with modern equipment.

He said that while the People's Republic of China is carrying out huge construction of the national economy, we have also witnessed the construction of a modern armed force. This army is defending the fruits of victory won by the Chinese people in long and arduous battles. In less than ten years, the People's Republic of China has been built into a truly great and powerful country. Its amazing scale of economic construction has shocked the world. This situation has aroused the hatred of all enemies of the People's Republic of China, who are trying to use various despicable means to obstruct the development speed of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese People's Army, in today's peaceful era, has written a new glorious page in the history of vigorously supporting the economic construction of the Chinese people. We can believe that this army is ready to defend its motherland.

Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the banquet. He said that the Chinese people have this army of the People's Liberation Army, so they have achieved the victory of the revolution. Today, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the guarantee of domestic peace and socialist construction. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government are willing to rely on this army to defend world peace together with the people of all countries. Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Soviet Union's army, navy and air force, and the armies of various socialist countries are our role models. We are also willing to learn from the armies of anti-colonialist countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Let us join hands to fight against colonialism and defend world peace. Vice Premier Chen Yi talked about the situation when the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was first established more than 30 years ago, pointing out that our army mainly relied on spears to fight at that time. He said that the struggle of our African black brothers is similar to our struggle back then. He warmly congratulated the African people on their struggle to achieve final victory.

Military attachés of various countries to China and the Burmese delegation of the Sino-Burmese Joint Border Committee headed by General Aung Gyi were invited to attend the reception.

Also present at the reception were General Yang Chengwu, General Zhang Aiping, General Xiao Hua, General Gan Siqi, General Li Juikui, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Liu Shao Wen, Lieutenant General Qiu Huizuo, Lieutenant General Qiu Chuangcheng, Lieutenant General Tan Jiasu of the Air Force, Vice Admiral Zhou Xihan of the Navy and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Geng Biao, Chinese Ambassador to Myanmar Li Yimang and his wife, Yao Zhongming, the chief Chinese representative of the Sino-Burmese Joint Border Committee, as well as representatives and advisors, also attended the reception.

    庆祝中国人民解放军建军三十三周年
    罗瑞卿大将举行招待会，各国驻华武官和以昂季将军为首的缅甸代表团应邀出席  陈毅副总理说，中国共产党和政府愿意依靠这支军队同各国人民一起保卫世界和平
    新华社1日讯　中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿大将今晚在人民大会堂举行招待会，庆祝中国人民解放军建军三十三周年。
    国务院副总理陈毅元帅出席了招待会。并且在招待会上讲了话。
    罗瑞卿大将在会上致词说，我们很高兴能够同社会主义国家、各友好国家武装部队的代表，和以昂季将军为首的中缅边界联合委员会的缅方代表，来庆祝这个节日。
    罗瑞卿大将说，三十三年来，中国人民军队在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，战胜了国内外强大敌人的进攻，取得了中国革命战争的胜利。现在，它正继续向着加强革命化、加速现代化的目标前进，担负着保卫祖国、保卫远东和世界和平的光荣任务。
    他说，我们是社会主义国家，我们的社会制度决定了我们是爱好和平的。在国家与国家的关系上，我们历来主张和平共处，我们愿意与所有爱好和平的国家，在五项原则的基础上建立友好合作的关系。最近我们同缅甸政府关于边界问题的谈判，取得了全面的公平合理的解决，就是一个很好的例证。但是，以美帝国主义为首的战争集团正在加紧扩军备战，不断进行挑衅活动，并与全世界人民为敌。因此，我们绝不能放松警惕，更不能对于最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义抱着任何不切实际的幻想，我们绝不为帝国主义的任何挑衅和威胁所吓倒，绝不向帝国主义乞求和平。如果帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在我们身上，我们必将予以坚决回击。我们坚信，在中国人民面前，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营面前，在全世界爱好和平人民的面前，敢于发动侵略战争的帝国主义，必将遭到可耻的彻底的失败！
    罗瑞卿大将代表我国国防部和中国人民解放军全体指战员，对参加今天招待会的各国武官以及昂季将军等贵宾表示热烈的欢迎和感谢。他提议为中国人民解放军的光荣节日，为中国人民解放军同所有友好国家军队之间的友谊，为以苏联为首的社会主义各国军队之间的兄弟友谊和团结，为到会的各国武官以及以昂季将军为首的缅甸朋友们的健康，和为亚洲和世界的持久和平干杯。
    捷克斯洛伐克驻我国武官拉克上校，在会上代表各国驻华武官致词说，中国人民解放军三十三年来的历史是光荣的和艰苦的历史，从1927年建军那天起，它经过了千百次战斗，粉碎了敌人的封锁，在长征中忍受了饥饿、疾病和难以忍受的痛苦，战胜了封建官僚、日本侵略者，战胜了中国反动派的几百万军队以及具有现代化装备的武装侵略者。
    他说，在中华人民共和国进行国民经济巨大建设的同时，我们也亲眼看到了现代化武装力量的建设。这支军队正保卫着中国人民在长期艰苦的战斗中所获得的胜利果实。不到十年，中华人民共和国就已建成一个真正伟大的强国了。它的惊人的经济建设规模，震动了全世界。这种情况，引起了中华人民共和国的一切敌人的仇视，他们企图用各种卑鄙的手段来阻挠中华人民共和国的发展速度。中国人民军队，于和平时期的今天，在大力支援中国人民经济建设的历史中写下了新的光荣的一页，我们可以相信，这支军队已准备好保卫自己的祖国。
    陈毅副总理在宴会上讲话。他说，中国人民有了解放军这支队伍，就取得了革命的胜利，在今天，中国人民解放军是国内和平和社会主义建设的保证。中国共产党和中国政府愿意依靠这支军队，同各国人民一起保卫世界和平。陈毅副总理说，苏联的陆海空军、各社会主义国家的军队，是我们学习的榜样，我们也愿意向亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲反殖民主义国家的军队学习，让我们携起手来，为反对殖民主义和保卫世界和平而斗争。陈毅副总理谈到了三十多年前中国工农红军刚刚建立时的情况，指出那时我们的军队主要依靠梭标进行战斗。他说，现在非洲的黑人弟兄的斗争和我们当年的斗争情况差不多。他热烈祝贺非洲人民的斗争获得最后的胜利。
    各国驻华武官和以昂季将军为首的中缅边界联合会的缅甸代表团，应邀出席了招待会。
    出席招待会的还有杨成武上将、张爱萍上将、萧华上将、甘泗淇上将、李聚奎上将、萧向荣中将、刘少文中将、丘会作中将、丘创成中将、谭家述空军中将、周希汉海军中将等中国人民解放军高级将领。
    外交部副部长耿飚、中国驻缅甸大使李一氓夫妇，中缅边界联合委员会中国首席代表姚仲明以及代表、顾问等也出席了招待会。
