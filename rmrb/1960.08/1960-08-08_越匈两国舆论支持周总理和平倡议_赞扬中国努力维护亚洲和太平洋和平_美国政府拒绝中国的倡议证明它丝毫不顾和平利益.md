　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 6th. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial today, warmly supporting Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's peace initiative on the Asian and Pacific coastal countries concluding a treaty of mutual non-aggression and turning the region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

　　The editorial said that this important peace proposal embodies the urgent desire of the people of the Asian and Pacific region. The editorial said that the Vietnamese people warmly respond to Premier Zhou Enlai's peace proposal, and unite with the people of Asian countries, and persevere in striving to achieve this noble aspiration.

　　Referring to the Sixth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Total Disarmament, the editorial said that this conference pointed the spearhead of the struggle of all Asian people at US imperialism; this embodies the irresistible fighting force of the people of our time.

　　Referring to the heavy blows dealt to US imperialism by the upsurge of the anti-American movement among the people of Japan, South Korea, Turkey, South Vietnam and other places, the editorial pointed out that although US imperialism has suffered failures and opposition everywhere, it is still continuing to prepare for wars of aggression. After transporting rocket weapons into Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, US imperialism is also attempting to transport such weapons into the countries of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, such as the Philippines and Thailand. More dangerously, after passing the new Japan-US military treaty, US imperialism wants to arm the Japanese army with rocket weapons, attempting to turn it into a shock force for US aggression in Asia.

　　The editorial concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people will resolutely unite with the Japanese people, the peace forces of Asia and the world, and contribute to the cause of opposing imperialism headed by the United States and defending peace in Asia and the world.

　　Hanoi's "New Era" newspaper also published a commentary today supporting Premier Zhou Enlai's peace initiative. The commentary, entitled "Make the Pacific Ocean Truly a Peaceful Ocean," pointed out that Premier Zhou Enlai's peace initiative once again demonstrates China's sincerity and determination to ease international tensions and eliminate the danger of war in the Asian and Pacific region.

　　The commentary said that since World War II, US imperialism has launched a war of aggression in Korea and occupied China's territory of Taiwan. It has also entrenched itself in South Korea, carried out military intervention in South Vietnam and Laos, established the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and concluded a new Japan-US "security treaty." The Pacific region has become a place for US imperialism to test atomic bombs and conduct atomic exercises. The commentary pointed out that this series of aggressive and war-preparing activities by US imperialism has created tension in the Pacific region.

　　The commentary said that the people of the Pacific region have always hoped to live a peaceful life. "Premier Zhou Enlai's initiative fully conforms to this earnest desire, so it will surely be warmly supported by all peace-loving people around the world."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 6th. The Hungarian "People's Freedom Daily" published commentaries on the 4th and 6th respectively on Premier Zhou Enlai's initiative on the Asian and Pacific coastal countries signing a peace pact.

　　The "People's Freedom Daily"'s commentary on the 4th, entitled "China's Initiative to Strive for Peace in the Pacific Region," said that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal that Asian and Pacific coastal countries, including the United States, sign a treaty of mutual non-aggression and build the entire region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone, has very important significance in the current world political situation. Due to the aggressive policy of the United States, the Pacific region has become one of the "foci of tension" today. If the countries of the Pacific region can be linked together by a treaty of mutual non-aggression in accordance with China's proposal, and all become members of the nuclear-weapon-free zone, it will have a beneficial impact on the future development of the world political situation.

　　The commentary then pointed out that it is noteworthy that the US State Department spokesman hurriedly attempted to dismiss this serious Chinese proposal as "propaganda," and hysterically vilified China. This proves that American politicians are very afraid of the impact that China's proposal will have.

　　The commentary said that China's proposal will be supported by public opinion in the countries of the Pacific region. Despite the United States' best efforts to undermine China's positive proposals, the idea of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and its reminder to the people of the Pacific region countries to fight against aggressive policies, cannot but have an impact on the people of these regions, and will first and foremost strengthen the struggle against US military bases. China's proposal and the US rejection clearly show that China is fighting for peace in the region, while the United States is working to maintain the focus of tension in the region.

　　The "People's Freedom Daily" commentary on the 6th said that the People's Republic of China's meaningful new initiative, based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, has attracted significant attention worldwide. If this initiative can be realized, it will make a great contribution to easing international tensions and consolidating peace in the Pacific and the entire Far East.

　　The commentary condemned the US official attitude towards China's proposal. It said that in dealing with China's proposal, the US State Department has once again fallen into an embarrassing and ridiculous situation. Less than a few hours after China's new proposal was made public, when it was clearly impossible to study the proposal, the US State Department's machinery began to operate. The US State Department spokesman had already automatically declared the proposal to be "propaganda" and "unacceptable." The commentary said that the US government's attitude is "shameless" and "completely disregards the interests of peace."

    越匈两国舆论支持周总理和平倡议
    赞扬中国努力维护亚洲和太平洋和平
    美国政府拒绝中国的倡议证明它丝毫不顾和平利益
    新华社河内6日电　越南“人民报”今天发表的社论，热烈支持中国周恩来总理关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国缔结一项互不侵犯的和平公约并把这个地区变成无核武器地区的和平倡议。
    社论说，这一重要的和平建议体现了亚洲和太平洋区域各国人民的迫切愿望。社论说，越南人民热烈响应周恩来总理的和平建议，并同亚洲各国人民团结在一起，坚持为实现这个崇高的愿望而奋斗。
    这篇社论在谈到第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会时说，这个会议把全体亚洲人民的斗争锋芒指向美帝国主义；这体现了我们时代的人民的不可抗拒的斗争力量。
    社论在谈到日本、南朝鲜、土耳其、越南南方等地人民高涨的反美运动给了美帝国主义沉重的打击以后指出，美帝国主义虽然在各地遭到失败和反对，但它仍然继续准备侵略战争。美帝国主义在把火箭武器运进日本、南朝鲜和台湾之后，又企图向东南亚侵略集团各国，例如菲律宾和泰国运进这类武器。更危险的是，在通过了新日美军事条约后，美帝国主义要以火箭武器来武装日本军队，企图把它变成美国在亚洲进行侵略活动的突击队。
    社论最后说，越南人民将坚决和日本人民、亚洲和全世界的和平力量团结起来，为反对以美国为首的帝国主义、为保卫亚洲和世界和平的事业作出贡献。
    河内“新时代”报今天也发表评论，支持周恩来总理的和平倡议。这篇题为“使太平洋真正成为太平的海洋”的评论指出，周恩来总理的和平创议再一次表明了中国对于缓和国际紧张局势和消除亚洲和太平洋地区的战争危险的诚意和决心。
    评论说，第二次世界大战以来，美帝国主义在朝鲜发动了侵略战争，侵占了中国领土台湾。它还盘踞南朝鲜，对越南南方和老挝进行军事干涉，成立侵略性的东南亚军事集团，并缔结新日美“安全条约”。太平洋地区已经成为美帝国主义试验原子弹、进行原子演习的场所。评论指出，美帝国主义这一系列侵略和备战活动，造成了太平洋地区的紧张局势。
    评论说，太平洋区域各国人民一向希望过和平的生活。“周恩来总理的倡议完全符合这个恳切的愿望，因此它一定会受到全世界所有爱好和平的人民的热烈支持”。
    新华社布达佩斯6日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”4日和6日先后就周恩来总理关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国签订和平公约的倡议发表了评论。
    “人民自由报”4日的题为“中国为争取太平洋地区和平的倡议”的评论说，周恩来总理提出的关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内签订互不侵犯的和平公约，把这整个地区建成为没有核武器的地区的建议，在现今的世界政治局势中有非常重要的意义。由于美国的侵略政策，今天太平洋地区已成为“紧张焦点”之一。如果太平洋地区各国能依照中国的建议让互不侵犯条约把它们联结在一起，并都成为无原子区的一员，那就会对今后世界政治局势的发展起有利影响。
    评论接着指出，使人注目的是，美国国务院的发言人匆忙企图把这一严正的中国建议说成是“宣传”，并且还歇斯底里地大肆污蔑中国。这证明了美国的政治家们非常害怕中国建议将发生的影响。
    评论说，中国建议将会得到太平洋地区各国人民公众舆论的支持。尽管美国千方百计地破坏中国的积极建议，但建立无原子区的思想、以及它对太平洋地区各国人民为反对侵略政策而斗争的提醒，不能不对这一地区的各国人民起着影响，而首先一定会加强反对美国军事基地的斗争。中国的建议和美国的拒绝都明显地表明，中国是为这地区的和平而斗争，而美国却是为保持这一地区的紧张焦点而努力。
    “人民自由报”6日的评论说，中华人民共和国的有意义的、根据和平共处原则而产生的新倡议，在全世界引起了重大的注意。如果这项倡议能够实现的话，那将对缓和国际紧张局势和巩固太平洋及整个远东地区的和平作出很大的贡献。
    评论谴责美国官方对待中国建议的态度。它说，在对待中国这一建议方面，美国国务院又一次陷入了难堪的可笑的境地。在中国的新建议公开发表还不到几个小时后，当时显然还没有可能对这个建议进行研究，而美国国务院的机器就开始活动了。美国国务院的发言人就已经自动式地宣称了这一建议是“宣传性质的”、“不可接受的”。评论说，美国政府的这种态度是“厚颜无耻的”和“丝毫不顾和平利益的”。
