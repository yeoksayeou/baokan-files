    Supporting Agriculture is Our Bounden Duty
    Since April this year, our group has been tasked with producing a batch of agricultural machinery and fertilizer equipment. During our monthly planning discussions, everyone says, "We are making machines for our farmer brothers; the heavier the task, the greater our glory."
    After our group received the agricultural machinery production assignment in May, we were faced with a mountain of work and stacks of blueprints. So, we immediately held a group meeting to discuss it. Everyone scrambled to take on tasks. The experienced veteran workers said, "Everyone shares the heavy burden; we'll research any problems together and guarantee the completion of the task." Immediately, a competitive upsurge emerged, with everyone chasing after each other. The No. 4 lathe, which was used to machine a type of long screw rod, increased its output from one rod per hour to twelve rods per hour. Machine No. 287 was not to be outdone. They originally produced thirty small shafts per shift. Through innovation, adopting new technologies, and improving the tool fixture, they increased production to two hundred and fifty-one. The six machines in the group promoted each other, and everyone's enthusiasm grew. In June, compared to April, we achieved a four-fold increase. The task in July was heavier than in June, and the workpieces were more scattered, with a lot of time spent on loading and unloading, changing tools, and sharpening knives. Everyone used their brains and came up with solutions, classifying workpieces by type, turning small quantities into large quantities. This way, the tools that originally had to be adjusted five or six times a day no longer needed adjustment. The auxiliary time was reduced, and the saved man-hours increased production, creating favorable conditions for completing this batch of agricultural machinery manufacturing tasks ahead of schedule.
    Supporting agriculture is to change our country's "poor and blank" face more quickly. All comrades in our group warmly respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and are determined to do a good job in supporting agriculture in the movement to increase production and practice economy.

    支援农业义不容辞
    我们小组自今年4月份以来，担任了生产一批农业机械和化肥设备的任务。在每月讨论计划的时候，大家都说：“我们为农民兄弟做机器，任务越重越光荣。”
    我们小组在5月份接到生产农业机械的任务以后，眼看生活一大堆，图纸也有几大叠。于是，我们马上开小组会讨论。大家纷纷抢着要任务。老师傅们说：“千斤重担大家挑，有问题大家研究，保证完成任务。”大家立即掀起了一个你追我赶的竞赛热潮。四号车床车一种长螺丝杆，由原来一小时一根，跃为一小时能车十二根。二百八十七号机床也不甘示弱。他们原来车小轴一班三十根，通过闹革新、采用新技术和改进刀夹具，提高到二百五十一根。小组里六台机床相互促进，大家劲头越来越大，6月份同4月份比较，实现了一顶四。7月份任务比6月份重，工作物又零星，上料下料，调换刀具，磨刀等辅助时间花费很多。大家便动脑筋，想办法，把工作物按同类型归类，变少量为大量。这样，原来一天要调刀五、六次的，现在不调也行了。辅助时间减少，节省下工时来增加了生产，为提早完成这批农业机械制造任务创造了有利条件。
    支援农业是为了更快地改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌。我们全组同志热烈响应党中央的号召，决心在增产节约运动中做好支援农业的工作。
