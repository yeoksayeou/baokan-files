Serving Agricultural Technical Transformation is the Primary Task of Commune-Run Industries
Zhang Gengsheng

In the great undertaking of developing the commune economy, the Huashan Commune in Guangdong Province has correctly implemented the principle of commune industries directly serving agricultural production. As a result, the commune has seen a leading leap forward in agricultural production, with all other aspects following suit. The industries, agriculture, and various production sectors have experienced continuous great leaps forward year after year. Huashan Commune, in its endeavor to develop commune-run industries to serve agriculture, has pointed out a correct direction for the commune-run economy in Guangdong Province.

The Founding History of Huashan Commune's Industries

To better illustrate how Huashan Commune's commune-run industries support agriculture, here is a brief account of the industry's development. Before the communization in 1958, industry in this area was practically non-existent. The establishment of the People's Commune opened up a vast new world for establishing industries in the countryside. The commune faced difficulties from the outset, including a lack of funds, technical expertise, equipment, and experience. However, they promoted the spirit of hard work and self-reliance, adopting a strategy of starting with the easy and progressing to the difficult, starting with indigenous methods before adopting foreign ones. During the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958, particularly the bumper harvest of grain, and in the movement to produce iron and steel on a large scale, they organized labor to mine iron ore, coal, and peat, and established brick and tile factories, lime factories, and simple agricultural machinery factories. This strongly supported national construction and accumulated funds for the development of commune industries. During the spring plowing season of 1959, the commune party committee timely proposed that while developing agriculture, it was also necessary to develop commune industries to support agricultural production. At that time, in addition to consolidating and expanding existing brick and tile factories, coal mines, and lime kilns, they also established a batch of factories directly serving agriculture, such as agricultural tool and machinery factories, small farm implement processing factories, fertilizer factories, and pesticide factories. Later, after the industries accumulated a batch of funds, they established tractor stations, transportation stations, and a batch of agricultural and sideline product processing factories, as well as hydraulic and hydroelectric power stations.

The commune used the profits from industrial production, besides supporting agriculture, to purchase necessary mechanical equipment for industry. The factory buildings used by the commune-run industrial and mining enterprises have always been simple and makeshift. Under such diligent and thrifty management, and through self-reliance, the entire commune established its own nineteen industrial sectors and forty-three industrial and mining enterprises of various sizes in just over a year. They possessed seven power equipment units (totaling 89 horsepower) and twelve various machine tools. In addition to the agricultural tool factory, which had basically achieved mechanization, the remaining factories and mines were vigorously promoting the "four modernizations." The commune industry already had a workforce capable of mastering general technical operations. The main products produced included twenty-six types, such as fertilizers, pesticides, rubber-tired carts, animal-drawn carts, raw coal, bricks, tiles, and pottery, and they could manufacture and repair more than seventy types of machine parts for automobiles, trailers, tractors, and bicycles. In addition, they also established a tractor station with seventeen units and a transportation station with eight trucks and more than forty animal-drawn carts.

The commune's industrial production experienced extremely rapid development. In the past year, the entire commune produced more than 150,000 small farm implements, mined more than 30,000 tons of raw coal, produced more than 90 million bricks and tiles, and manufactured more than 20,000 tons of fertilizer and 200 tons of pesticides.

The Role of Commune-Run Industries in Supporting Agricultural Technical Transformation

The comprehensive leap forward in both industry and agriculture achieved by Huashan Commune is due to the close integration of the commune's industries with agricultural production from the very beginning. The construction of the commune's industries was primarily aimed at supporting the development of agricultural production. Among the commune-run industries' nineteen sectors, six directly provided means of production and mechanized equipment for agriculture, and six processed agricultural products, accounting for 60% of the entire industry. Sixteen of the twenty-six main products were directly used in agricultural production. In the first half of this year, the value of products produced by industry in support of agriculture reached more than 1.7 million yuan, accounting for 71% of the total industrial output value. The role of Huashan Commune's industries in supporting agricultural production is prominently reflected in the following aspects:

First, commune industries provide semi-mechanized and mechanized equipment for agriculture, greatly increasing agricultural labor productivity. Firstly, the commune established a tractor station, with mechanized farming covering more than 30,000 mu, accounting for more than 30% of the commune's total cultivated land area, including more than 50% of the paddy field area. This alone saves 90,000 labor days and 30,000 cattle workdays annually. In addition to being fully engaged in field operations during busy farming seasons, some tractors are also responsible for short-distance transportation tasks for agricultural production during slack seasons. In the second quarter of this year alone, tractors transported 1.8 million jin of fertilizer for various production teams, equivalent to the workload of more than 400 laborers during the same period. Tractors not only save a large amount of labor for agricultural production, but also the yield of fields cultivated by machines is generally higher than that of fields plowed by cattle. According to the experiment of the Nanling Production Brigade, under the same conditions, this year's early rice yield in machine-cultivated fields was 52 jin per mu higher than that in cattle-cultivated fields, an increase of about 12%. Secondly, commune industries manufactured various transportation tools for agriculture, which has a universal and important effect on saving labor used for transportation. By the end of June this year, the commune agricultural machinery factory had assembled more than 1,600 rubber-tired carts and more than 1,000 other wooden-wheeled handcarts. One rubber-tired cart with two medium-strength laborers can pull 500-600 jin at a time, which is equivalent to the workload of five or six strong laborers. If calculated with 120 days of use per year, 1,600 rubber-tired carts can save more than 600,000 labor days, equivalent to increasing the agricultural production labor force by more than 2,000 people.

Because commune industries provide various mechanical equipment for agriculture, they have promoted agricultural technical transformation, enabling agriculture to rapidly move towards semi-mechanization and mechanization. At the same time, it has also greatly promoted the construction of basic farmland. At present, the majority of the commune's water conservancy and irrigation has been self-flowing, basically ending the passive situation of "waterwheels ringing after three days without rain," and saving waterwheels from drought resistance every year. This alone can save 6-7 workdays per mu annually. The existing thousands of waterwheels have also been installed with ball bearings this year, and three people used to pedal one waterwheel, but now only two people are needed. The commune has also established more than ten hydroelectric and hydraulic processing stations of various sizes, totaling 74 horsepower; there are currently more than ten hydraulic engineering projects under construction, which are expected to be completed by the end of the year. According to rough calculations, the above major measures can save more than 1.4 million labor days in agricultural labor production throughout the year, equivalent to an increase of more than 4,000 laborers. This not only makes up for the labor force drawn away by industry but also makes agriculture more intensive. In the past, the labor force used for transportation in agriculture generally accounted for more than 35% of the total labor volume. Due to the realization of wheeled transportation, the amount of labor used in transportation has been reduced to only about 20% of what it used to be. According to the investigation of several production brigades such as Pingnan, Lubian, and Hua'an, the situation is similar. Taking Hua'an production brigade as an example, this is a brigade with few people and a lot of land, with an average of seven mu of land burdened by each laborer. The labor force allocated to support industry accounts for 10% of the total labor force; however, the commune allocated 32 rubber-tired carts to this production brigade, and the land cultivated by tractors accounts for half of the total cultivated land. In 1959, the amount of labor used for one mu of early rice was 22, of which transportation alone (transporting fertilizer, transporting grain) accounted for more than eight workdays, accounting for 36% of the total labor volume. This year, the amount of labor used for one mu of early rice has been reduced to 16, a reduction of 27%. In particular, the amount of labor used for transportation has been reduced from eight to four, saving half. This year's early rice used less labor, but the unit yield has increased a lot compared to the same period last year.

Second, commune industries provide a large amount of fertilizer, lime, pesticides, and various small farm implements and other means of production for agricultural production. At present, the lime and various small farm implements produced by the commune can not only basically meet the needs of the commune but also support other places. In the first half of this year, more than 30,000 small farm implements were supported to other places. In the past year, the commune fertilizer factory produced 21,000 tons of various mixed fertilizers and native fertilizers, with an average of more than 400 jin per mu of cultivated land; the lime factory produced more than 12 million jin, with an average of 200 jin per mu of paddy field. In the period of advanced cooperatives, it took two loads of stones to exchange for one load of lime. The pesticide factory produced more than 200 tons of native pesticides. In the past, insect pests were very serious here. In 1954 and 1956, the early rice crops were severely reduced due to insect pests; however, since last year, the local pesticides manufactured by the commune industry have been relied upon to control diseases and insect pests, ensuring increased grain production.

In addition, the agricultural product processing industry has also played a great role in promoting agriculture and promoting urban and rural exchanges. The products of the commune's pottery factory, rice mill, paper mill, and tea factory not only meet the needs of the commune but also support cities and other regions.

Third, commune industries have accumulated a large amount of funds for agricultural production. Before communization, the lack of funds in agricultural production was a common difficulty, and loans had to be obtained from the state every spring. After the Huashan Commune established a strong commune industrial economy, the difficulty of insufficient funds was solved. In the first half of 1958, the loans from various advanced cooperatives to the National Bank amounted to 460,000 yuan, with an average loan of more than 7,000 yuan for each production brigade. After the commune established industries, it not only repaid the 670,000 yuan of state loans accumulated over the years for the production teams but also paid a large amount of funds on time. In the past year, the cumulative amount of funds transferred from commune industries to support agriculture has reached more than 2.6 million yuan. Of the 2.03 million yuan needed for agricultural production in 1959 alone, the commune industry accumulated more than 800,000 yuan, accounting for 38%.

The commune industrial economy not only provides a large amount of funds for agricultural production but also guarantees the commune to pay wages on a monthly basis, gradually improving and improving the lives of its members. Since November 1958, wages have been paid every month. The members are filled with infinite joy at the commune paying wages on a monthly basis, and everyone is full of enthusiasm, happy, and has greatly improved their enthusiasm for production.

Several Main Experiences of Commune-Run Industries

The fact that Huashan Commune's commune-run industries directly serve agriculture, promoting the common and great development of industrial and agricultural production, vividly illustrates that the People's Commune has infinitely strong vitality in organizing the comprehensive leap forward of industrial and agricultural production. Only by correctly organizing the commune economy can the superiority of the People's Commune be fully demonstrated. Huashan Commune's experience shows that the so-called relationship between the commune economy and the production brigade economy is essentially the relationship between industry and agriculture within the commune. This is a very important aspect. If the commune industry takes supporting agriculture and serving agricultural production as its primary task, the commune economy and the production brigade economy will inevitably achieve coordination and common leap forward. Otherwise, many contradictions between the commune economy and the production brigade economy cannot be resolved, which will directly affect the development of the entire commune's production. Therefore, the development of commune industries must focus on the development of industrial construction that supports agriculture and serves agriculture. As long as the commune industry serves agricultural production and effectively promotes agricultural production, the commune economy will develop faster, because the development of agricultural production is the foundation and prerequisite for industrial development. This is the case in the entire national construction, and it is especially the case within the commune. Because the industry of Huashan Commune has truly done a good job in supporting agriculture, the cadres and members of the production brigade also regard the commune industry as a "backing" for the development of agricultural production. The commune organizes raw material production and helps with industrial infrastructure construction during slack farming seasons, and the production brigade actively supports it. This has given the commune industry a reliable foundation for labor, raw materials, and markets. From here, we further realize that "the People's Commune is the best organizational form for accelerating socialist construction and transitioning to communism," and its significance lies in the fact that the People's Commune can grasp both industry and agriculture together, so that industrial and agricultural production can better cooperate with each other, support each other, and develop together. The experience of Huashan Commune proves that to run commune industries well, the following points must be grasped.

First, it is necessary to unswervingly implement the principle that commune-run industries directly serve agricultural production. The development of commune industries is to ensure the great development of agriculture. Promoting agricultural technical transformation and promoting the comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production are the primary tasks of commune industries. To earnestly implement this policy, it is necessary to resolutely oppose capitalist management thinking and any views that despise supporting agriculture. Many cadres engaged in the commune economy believe that the industries that the commune engages in to serve agriculture are not important industries, make little money, and have no prospects; they always want to engage in large and foreign equipment and products with high output value. Especially in communes near large and medium-sized cities, some factories and shops in the city are willing to ask the commune's factories to process and manufacture semi-finished products for them, and these are all high-output value and money-making jobs. In this case, the commune industry can easily deviate from agricultural production and embark on the road of specializing in processing services for the city. Of course, it is entirely necessary for the commune industry to support the city with a certain amount of power and supplement the deficiencies of the national large industry, provided that it first supports agriculture. However, it is wrong to deviate from agricultural production and not serve agricultural production. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly struggle against these erroneous ideas and educate the cadres and workers engaged in industry in the commune to establish the idea of serving agriculture and recognize that industrial service to agriculture is a glorious task. Although serving agriculture may not have a very high output value, with the development of industrial and agricultural production, agriculture will increasingly require modern equipment and more fertilizers, pesticides, and various new farm implements. Commune industries can only have broad development prospects if they serve agriculture. Industrial support for agriculture is an important policy in the current socialist construction of our country. In the People's Commune, it has even more urgent practical significance. Only by threading this policy like a red line through all the economic work of the commune can the industrial and agricultural production of the commune take off together and leap forward together.

Second, commune-run industries must actively develop the agricultural machinery industry (including setting up some small iron smelting furnaces) to provide agriculture with a large number of new farm implements and transportation tools, promote the comprehensive technical transformation of agriculture, realize semi-mechanization and mechanization, rapidly increase agricultural labor productivity, and solve the difficulties of insufficient agricultural labor. This is the most important link in industrial support for agriculture and the development of agriculture. Huashan Commune strengthened the industry's support for agriculture only because it first established agricultural machinery factories, agricultural implement repair stations, and tractor stations. At the same time, it also paved the way for allocating labor to develop industry. The first establishment of an agricultural machinery industry that serves agriculture is also an important measure for communes to run industries, adopting self-equipment and self-reliance.

Commune-run industries must also vigorously develop industries that manufacture fertilizers, pesticides, and lime, which are very important for improving agricultural production, saving labor, and saving funds. According to the requirements of agricultural production for constantly increasing the yield per unit area, fertilizer factories should mass-produce various high-quality mixed fertilizers, granular fertilizers, and chemical fertilizers, and pesticide factories should provide the necessary insecticides. At the same time, it is also necessary to give full play to the role of all new farm implements and tractors, deeply plow and deeply turn, and cultivate intensively and meticulously in order to ensure that the yield per unit area is rapidly increased.

Commune industries should also appropriately develop agricultural and sideline product processing, daily necessities, building materials, fuel, and other industries under the premise of serving agriculture in everything. This not only supports national construction and meets the needs of people's lives but is also an important source of funds for agriculture.

Finally, to develop commune industries, it is necessary to implement the principle of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and to be diligent and thrifty, cherishing every yuan of funds. Too much and too fast cannot be done at once in basic construction, and poor methods and local methods must be used to keep things simple. Huashan Commune has earnestly implemented the spirit of diligence and thrift in developing industrial production. Although the commune has a lot of economic income, they did not build a large auditorium or office building, and used all the accumulated funds to solve the agricultural investment of each production brigade, adding necessary industrial equipment and paying the wages of commune members. This fully reflects their ambition to build socialism. At the same time, it is necessary to rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and constantly improve the operation and management of commune enterprises, gradually realize the "four modernizations" of industrial production, improve labor productivity, and gradually improve the commune industry from local to foreign, from small to large. This is also an important task for running commune industries well. In addition, industrial leaders must pay attention to cultivating their own technical talents.

The achievements made by Huashan Commune in just over a year not only further consolidated the People's Commune economically, increasingly demonstrating the great role of the People's Commune, but also greatly strengthened the relationship between the commune and the production brigade due to the development and strengthening of the commune economy and strong support for agriculture. Therefore, correctly implementing the policy of commune industries serving agriculture has great political and economic significance for accelerating agricultural technical transformation and improving agricultural labor productivity.

    为农业技术改造服务是社办工业的首要任务
    张根生
    广东省花山公社在大办公社经济中，正确地贯彻执行了公社工业直接为农业生产服务的方针，因此公社建立一年多，就出现了农业生产一马当先，万马奔腾，工业、农业和各项生产连年不断大跃进的发展局面。花山公社在大办公社工业为农业服务方面，为广东省人民公社的社办经济指出了一个正确的方向。
    花山公社办工业的创业史
    为了便于说明花山公社社办工业支援农业的情况，这里先把该社办工业的发展概况作一叙述。1958年公社化以前，这个地区的工业还是一张白纸。人民公社成立后，才为在农村中建立工业开辟了广阔的天地。公社办工业，一开始就碰到了没有资金、技术力量、设备和没有经验等困难。但是，他们发扬了艰苦奋斗的精神，白手创业的英雄本色，采取了先易后难，先土后洋的办法。在1958年农业生产大跃进，特别是粮食大丰收的有利条件下，在大搞钢铁的运动中，他们组织劳动力上山炼铁、挖煤、挖泥炭土，并建立起砖瓦厂、石灰厂和简单的农械厂，有力地支援了国家建设，又为发展公社工业积累了资金。1959年春耕时，公社党委及时地提出了在发展农业的同时，要发展公社工业，以支援农业生产。当时，他们除了把已建立的砖瓦厂、煤矿、石灰窑等加以整顿和扩大外，又建立了农具机械厂、小农具加工厂、肥料厂、农药厂等一批为农业直接服务的工厂。后来，工业积累了一批资金，又建立了拖拉机站、运输站和一批农副产品加工厂、水力、水电站。
    公社对工业生产的利润，除去用于支援农业外，还购置了工业上所必要的机械设备。公社办的工矿企业用的厂房，一直是因陋就简的。在这样克勤克俭、自力更生的经营下，在一年多的时间里，全社建立起了自己的十九个工业行业，大小四十三个工矿企业，拥有动力设备七台（共八十九马力），各种机床十二台。除农具厂已基本实现了机械化外，其余各厂矿也都在大力推行“四化”。公社工业已经有了一支能够掌握一般技术操作的工人队伍。生产的主要产品有肥料、农药、胶轮车、畜力车、原煤、砖瓦、陶器等二十六种，并能制造和修配汽车拖车、拖拉机、单车等机器零件七十余种。此外，还建立了有十七个混合台的拖拉机站和八部汽车、四十余部畜力车的运输站。
    公社工业生产有了极迅速的发展。一年多来，全社总共生产小农具十五万多件，开采原煤三万多吨，生产了九千多万块砖瓦，制造了二万多吨肥料和二百多吨农药。
    社办工业在支援农业技术改造中的作用
    花山公社的工业、农业同时取得全面跃进，这是因为公社的工业从创办以来，同农业生产就紧紧地拧在一起。公社工业的建设，首先是为了支援农业生产的发展。社办工业的十九个行业中，直接为农业提供生产资料和机械化装备的就有六个行业，为农产品加工的有六个行业，两者共占全行业的60％。二十六种主要产品中直接用于农业生产的有十六种。今年上半年工业支援农业的产品产值达一百七十余万元，占工业总产值的71％。花山公社工业支援农业生产的作用，突出的表现在以下几个方面：
    第一，公社工业为农业提供半机械化和机械化的装备，大大提高了农业劳动生产率。首先公社建立了拖拉机站，机耕面积达三万余亩，占全公社总耕地面积30％多，其中占水田面积的50％以上。仅这一项，每年就为农业节约九万个劳动日，同时节省牛工三万个。拖拉机除了农忙时全部投入田间作业外，农闲时还有一部分拖拉机为农业生产担负短途运输任务。今年仅第二季度，拖拉机为各生产队运送的肥料即达一百八十万斤，相当于同期四百多个劳动力的工作量。拖拉机不仅为农业生产节约了大批劳动力，而且机耕的田一般均较牛犁的田的产量要增产一些。据南岭生产大队的试验，在同样条件下，今年早造机耕田比牛耕田每亩增产五十二斤，增产约12％。其次，公社工业为农业制造了各种运输工具，这对节省用在运输上的劳动力，更有着普遍而重要的作用。到今年6月底止，公社农械厂装配了胶轮车一千六百多部，其它木轮手推车一千多部。一部胶轮车二个中等劳动力一次可拉五、六百斤，这就等于通常五、六个强劳动力的工作量。如以一年有一百二十天使用计算，一千六百部胶轮车，就可节约六十多万个劳动日，等于增加了农业生产的劳动力二千余个。
    由于公社工业为农业提供了各种机械设备，因而就推动了农业的技术改造，使农业迅速地向着半机械化、机械化的道路迈进。同时，也大大推动了农田基本建设的进行。现在，全公社的水利灌溉，绝大部分实现了自流化，基本结束了“三天无雨水车响”，每年车水抗旱的被动局面。仅这一项，每年每亩就可以节约六、七个工；现有的几千部水车，今年也都安上了滚珠轴承，过去三个人踩一部水车，现在只用两个人。公社还建立了大小十多个水电站和水力加工站，共有七十四马力；目前还有十几宗水力工程正在兴建，预计年底可以完成三十宗水力工程。以上几项主要措施，据粗略计算，全年在农业劳动生产中就可以节约一百四十多万个劳动日，等于增加了四千多个劳动力。这样不仅补上了工业抽调的劳动力，而且可以使农业更能精耕细作了。过去农业上每年用于运输的劳动力，一般都占总劳动量的35％以上。由于实现了车子化，运输方面的用工量已减少到只占过去的20％左右。根据平南、录边、华安等几个生产大队的调查，情况莫不如此。以华安生产大队为例，这是一个人少地多的队，平均每一个劳力负担七亩地。全队调配支援工业的劳动力占总劳动力的10％；但是公社拨给这个生产大队的胶轮车三十二部，拖拉机耕的土地占总耕地的一半。1959年一亩早造水稻的用工量为二十二个，其中仅运输一项（运肥、运谷）即占八个多工，占总用工量的36％。今年早造一亩水稻用工量减少为十六个，减少27％。特别是运输用工量从八个减为四个，节约了一半。今年早造的用工量减少了，单位产量却较去年同期增长了很多。
    第二，公社工业为农业生产提供了大量的肥料、石灰、农药以及各种小农具等生产资料。现在公社生产的石灰和各种小农具，不仅可以基本满足本公社的需要，而且还可以支援外地。今年上半年支援外地的小农具达三万多件。一年多来，公社肥料厂生产了各种混合肥、土化肥二万一千吨，按耕地平均每亩有四百多斤；石灰厂生产了一千二百多万斤，平均每亩水田二百斤。高级社时期，这里要挑二担石头去才能换回一担石灰。农药厂生产了土农药二百多吨。过去这里虫害甚为严重，1954年、1956年早造都因虫害而严重减收；但从去年以来，依靠公社工业自己制造的土农药防治了病虫害，保证了粮食的增产。
    此外，还有农产品加工工业，对促进农业，促进城乡交流也起了很大作用。公社的陶器厂、碾米厂、纸厂、茶厂生产的产品，不但满足了本社的需要，而且还支援了城市和其它地区。
    第三，公社工业为农业生产积累了大量的资金。公社化以前，农业生产中资金不足是一个普遍的困难，每到春季都要向国家贷款。花山公社建立了强大的公社工业经济以后，资金不足的困难就得到了解决。1958年上半年，当时各高级社向国家银行的贷款达四十六万元，平均每一个生产大队贷款七千多元。公社办起了工业之后，不但为各生产队清还了历年积欠的国家贷款六十七万元，而且还按时支付了大量的资金。一年多来，公社工业上调支援农业的资金累计到二百六十多万元。仅1959年农业生产上需用的二百零三万元资金中，公社工业积累的即达八十余万元，占38％。
    公社工业经济不单为农业生产提供了大量的资金，而且保证了公社按月发工资，逐步提高和改善了社员的生活。从1958年11月份以来，月月能发工资。社员对公社按月发工资充满了无限喜悦之情，个个情绪饱满，心情舒畅，生产积极性大大提高。
    社办工业的几点主要经验
    花山公社社办工业直接为农业服务，促进了工、农业生产共同大发展的事实，生动地说明人民公社在组织工、农业生产全面大跃进中有无限强大的生命力。只有正确地组织公社经济，才能充分地显示人民公社的优越性。花山公社的经验说明：所谓公社经济与生产大队经济之间的关系问题，实质上是公社内部工业与农业的关系问题。这是很重要的一个方面。公社工业如果以支援农业、服务于农业生产为其首要任务，公社经济与生产大队经济必然会取得协调一致，共同跃进。不然，公社经济与生产大队经济之间的许多矛盾就无法解决，直接会影响公社整个生产的发展。因此，发展公社工业，必须以发展支援农业、为农业服务的工业建设为其中心。公社工业只要为农业生产服务，有力地推动农业生产，公社经济发展也就会越快，因为农业生产的发展正是工业发展的基础和先决条件。在整个国家建设中如此，在公社内部尤其如此。花山公社的工业由于真正做好了支援农业的工作，所以生产大队的干部和社员也把公社工业看作是发展农业生产的一个“靠山”。公社组织原料生产，在农闲时帮助搞工业基本建设，生产大队都积极支持。这就使公社工业有了劳动力、原料、市场的可靠基础。从这里，使我们进一步地体会到“人民公社是加速社会主义建设和向共产主义过渡的最好的组织形式”，其意义就在于人民公社能够把工业、农业一齐抓起来，使工农业生产更好地相互协作，相互支援，共同发展。花山公社的经验证明，要办好公社工业，必须抓好以下几条。
    首先，必须坚定不移地贯彻社办工业直接为农业生产服务的方针。发展公社工业就是为了保证农业的大发展。促进农业的技术改造，促进农业生产的全面跃进是公社工业的首要任务。要认真贯彻好这一方针，就必须坚决反对资本主义经营思想和任何轻视支援农业的观点。有不少搞公社经济的干部认为，公社搞为农业服务的工业，不是什么重要的工业，赚钱少，没有搞头；总想搞大、洋设备，搞产值高的产品。特别是在大中城市附近的公社，城市中有些工厂、商店愿意叫公社的工厂为其加工制造半成品，而这些又都是产值高、赚钱多的活路。在这种情况下，公社工业很容易脱离农业生产，走上专为城市加工服务的道路。当然，公社工业在首先支援农业的前提下，以一定的力量支援城市，补充国家大工业之不足，这是完全必要的。但是，如果脱离了农业生产，不为农业生产服务，则是错误的。因此，要经常与这些错误思想进行斗争，并教育公社搞工业的干部和职工，树立为农业服务的思想，认清工业为农业服务是光荣任务。为农业服务，虽然产值不一定很高，但是随着工农业生产的发展，农业将日益要求现代化装备，要求更多的化肥、农药和各种各样的新式农具。公社工业只有为农业服务，才有广阔的发展前途。工业支援农业是当前我国社会主义建设中的一个重要方针。在人民公社中，则具有更加迫切的现实意义。只有把这一方针像一条红线一样贯串在公社的全部经济工作中，公社的工农业生产才能比翼齐飞，共同跃进。
    其次，社办工业，必须积极地发展农业机械工业（包括搞些小炼铁炉），为农业提供大量的新式农具和运输工具，促进农业进行全面技术改造，实现半机械化和机械化，迅速地提高农业劳动生产率，解决农业劳动力不足的困难。这是工业支援农业，发展农业生产最重要的一环。花山公社就是因为首先建立了农械厂、农具修配站和拖拉机站等，才加强了工业对农业的支援作用。同时，也为调配劳动力发展工业开辟了道路。首先建立为农业服务的农业机械工业，这也是公社办工业，采取自己装备自己，自力更生的一条重要措施。
    社办工业还必须大力发展制造肥料、农药和石灰等工业，这对提高农业生产、节省劳动力和节省资金都有很重要的意义。根据农业生产不断提高单位面积产量的要求，肥料厂要大量制造各种质量好的混合肥、颗粒肥、化肥，农药厂要提供必需的杀虫药剂。同时，还要发挥一切新式农具、拖拉机的作用，深耕深翻、精耕细作，才能够保证单位产量迅速地提高。
    公社工业还应该在一切为农业服务的前提下，适当发展农副产品的加工、日用品、建筑材料、燃料等工业。这样，既支援了国家建设，又满足了人民生活的需要，也是为农业积累资金的一个重要来源。
    最后，发展公社工业，必须贯彻勤俭办企业的原则，要克勤克俭，爱惜每一元资金。基本建设不能一下子搞得太多、太快，要用穷办法、土办法，因陋就简。花山公社在发展工业生产中，认真地贯彻了勤俭节约的精神。公社经济收入虽然很多，但是他们没有盖一座大礼堂，也没有盖办公大楼，把积累的资金全部用来解决各生产大队的农业投资，添置必要的工业设备以及发放社员工资。这充分反映了他们建设社会主义的雄心壮志。同时，要依靠群众，发动群众，不断地改善公社企业的经营管理，逐步实现工业生产的“四化”，提高劳动生产率，并把公社工业从土到洋，从小到大逐步完善起来，这也是办好公社工业的一件重要工作。此外，工业的领导干部一定要注意培养自己的技术人材。
    花山公社在一年多的时间里所取得的成就，不但在经济上更加巩固了人民公社，日益显示了人民公社的伟大作用，而且由于公社经济的发展壮大和对农业的有力支援，大大密切了公社与生产大队的关系。因此，正确地执行公社工业为农业服务的方针，对加速农业技术改造，提高农业劳动生产率，有着巨大的政治的经济的意义。
