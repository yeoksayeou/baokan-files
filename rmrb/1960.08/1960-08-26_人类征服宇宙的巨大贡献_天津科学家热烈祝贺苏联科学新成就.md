    A Huge Contribution to Humanity's Conquest of the Universe
    Tianjin Scientists Warmly Congratulate the New Achievements of Soviet Science
    (Our Newspaper dispatch) The news of the safe return to Earth of the second Soviet satellite spaceship has aroused great interest among scientists and university professors in Tianjin. Everyone warmly congratulates the Soviet people on the remarkable achievements they have made in the great cause of space flight, and unanimously points out that this is a huge contribution to mankind's conquest of the universe, and the realization of mankind's wish to fly to interstellar space is not far away.
    Xiao Caiyu, chairman of the Tianjin Biological Society, said that the successful return to Earth of the second Soviet spacecraft and experimental animals can be said to have basically solved the difficult problems of human space flight. This new victory of the Soviet people is a victory of socialism and a victory of mankind's conquest of nature.
    Han Qingbo, director of the Department of Mathematics and Physics at Tianjin University, said: The fact that the second Soviet spacecraft entered outer space and returned to Earth at the expected time and location shows the great creativity of Soviet scientists, engineers, technicians, all workers, and the Soviet people in the comprehensive utilization of science and technology, especially in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and demonstrates the power of collective strength.
    Zhang Chongnian, director of the Department of Physics at Hebei University, said that it is already a remarkable achievement to launch a four point six-ton spacecraft to an altitude of three hundred and twenty kilometers and control it to run almost along its original orbit; after orbiting the Earth eighteen times, to issue commands and accurately descend to a predetermined area shows that the Soviet Union has already achieved a high degree of success in automatic control technology and in overcoming the various problems of passing through the atmosphere, which is really gratifying and encouraging. Soviet science and technology far surpass American imperialism. The great achievements of Soviet science and technology will powerfully encourage and strengthen the struggle of people of all countries for world peace and human progress.

    人类征服宇宙的巨大贡献
    天津科学家热烈祝贺苏联科学新成就
    本报讯　苏联发射的第二个卫星式宇宙飞船安全返回地面的消息，引起了天津市科学家和高等学校教授们的极大兴趣。大家热烈祝贺苏联人民在宇宙飞行的伟大事业中所获得的卓越成就，一致指出这是人类征服宇宙的巨大贡献，人类实现飞往星际空间的愿望已为期不远了。
    天津市生物学会理事长萧采瑜说，苏联发射的第二个宇宙飞船及试验动物顺利地返回地面，可以说把人类宇宙飞行的困难问题基本上解决了。苏联人民这一新的胜利，是社会主义的胜利，也是人类征服自然的胜利。
    天津大学数理系主任韩清波说：苏联第二个宇宙飞船进入宇宙空间，并按照预计的时间及地点返回地面，这说明在科学技术的综合利用方面，特别是在数学、物理、化学等方面，显示了苏联科学家、工程师、技术人员、一切工作人员和苏联人民的伟大创造力，显示了集体力量的威力。
    河北大学物理系主任张崇年说，一个四点六吨重的飞船发射到三百二十公里的高空，并且控制得几乎沿原行轨道而运行，这已经是一件了不起的事情；在绕地球十八周之后，发出命令，准确地向预定地区下降，这表明苏联在自动控制技术上、在克服通过大气层的种种问题上，都已经有了高度的成功，这实在是令人欢欣鼓舞的。苏联的科学技术远远地超过美帝国主义了。苏联科学技术上的伟大成就，将有力地鼓舞和加强各国人民争取世界和平和人类进步的斗争。
