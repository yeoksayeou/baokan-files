Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou: Pingliang Prefecture in Gansu Province is concentrating its leadership and main labor force to launch a surge in autumn field management, with weeding as the central task.

The Pingliang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, in its recent autumn field management campaign, first concentrated its leadership to go deep into the grassroots and into the fields. As of now, the entire prefecture has sent a total of 957 cadres from the prefecture, counties, and communes to rural grassroots to serve as deputy secretaries and deputy leaders of production team Party branches. Currently, over 30,000 cadres have gone to the forefront of agricultural production to lead the masses and strengthen autumn field management. Among the more than 700,000 laborers投入engaged in agricultural production in the entire prefecture, aside from those preparing for winter wheat sowing, summer plowing and deep plowing, accumulating and transporting manure, and other agricultural tasks, there are now over 500,000 laborers mainly engaged in autumn field management. Especially since late July and early August, when there have been successive heavy rains across the region, in order to prevent weed infestation, counties and cities have organized over 120,000 urban residents, office cadres, and students returning to their communes for vacation, with over 210,000 laborers as the backbone, to form more than 4,700 specialized weeding teams for a concentrated weeding effort. Ning County launched a week-long concentrated weeding campaign at the beginning of August, mobilizing more than 21,000 laborers. As of August 10th, the vast majority of the county's more than 580,000 mu of major autumn crops had been weeded twice, and the area of sorghum, corn, and potatoes weeded three times accounted for 97% of the total area. High-yield crops and abundant-yield fields in Jingchuan County have generally been weeded three to four times.

In order to ensure that autumn crops are well-fed and watered, before the heavy rains fully arrived, all localities universally adopted eight methods—accumulation, creation, searching, composting, picking up, smoking, burning, and collection (purchasing fertilizer accumulated by commune members individually)—to tap fertilizer sources, accumulating and transporting large quantities of fertilizer to ensure that a sufficient amount of fertilizer is applied to large areas of autumn fields. As of August 10th, 1.55 million mu of major autumn crops in the prefecture had been top-dressed once.

    平凉专区以锄草为中心管理秋田
    据新华社兰州讯　甘肃平凉专区正集中领导力量，集中主要劳动力，掀起以锄草为中心的秋田管理热潮。
    中共平凉地委在最近开展的秋田管理运动中，首先集中领导力量，深入基层，深入田间。全区到目前为止，派往农村基层担任生产队党支部副书记、副队长的专、县、社干部共达九百五十七名，现在共有三万多名干部，走上农业生产第一线，领导群众，加强秋田管理。全区投入生产第一线的七十多万劳力中，除准备冬小麦播种、伏耕深耕、积肥送肥和其他农活的劳力外，现有五十多万劳力主攻秋田管理。特别在7月下旬和8月初以来，全区各地连降透雨，为防止草荒现象，各县、市又以二十一万多名劳力为骨干，组织城镇居民、机关干部和假期回社学生十二万多人，组成了四千七百多个锄草专业队，突击锄草。宁县全县在8月初出动两万一千多名劳力，开展突击锄草运动周，截至8月10日，全县五十八万多亩大秋作物，绝大部分锄了两次草，锄过三次的高粱、玉米、洋芋占总面积的97％。泾川县高产作物和丰产田普遍锄过了三至四次草。
    为了保证秋田作物吃饱喝好，各地在未落透雨前，普遍采取积、造、搜、沤、拾、熏、烧、收（收购社员个人积攒的肥料）等八种办法，挖掘肥源，大积大送，千方百计保证给大面积秋田施足肥料。截至8月10日，全区大秋作物已有一百五十五万亩追过一次肥。
