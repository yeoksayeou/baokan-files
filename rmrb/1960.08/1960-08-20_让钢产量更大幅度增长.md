Let Steel Production Increase More Substantially

    A production increase and conservation movement centered on grain and steel has begun. We stand at the forefront of steelmaking production, with a significant and glorious responsibility. We are determined to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee with practical actions, striving for a more substantial increase in steel production to ensure the early and overfulfillment of our group's annual national steel production plan.

    Now, the days of scorching heat and heavy rain are coming to an end, and the golden season for steel production has arrived. It is a good time for heroes to show their talents. At the same time, the comrades on all fronts, such as coal, transportation, and mining, have launched new production upsurges around steel production. It is truly "Heaven helping those who help themselves." We are determined to exert great effort, first to improve production in August and September, and strive to increase the daily steel output by a significant step on the basis of the leap forward in July.

    The comrades in our group believe that the most direct and effective way to further increase production is to engage in rapid steelmaking. Everyone should do their job well and cooperate closely, racing against time, so that auxiliary production time and steelmaking time can be greatly shortened. To ensure the quality of steel, ensuring that every furnace produces good steel, not only steelmakers and first assistants must observe the steelmaking temperature at any time and grasp the chemical composition of the steel, but the furnace workers also ensure that they check the temperature at any time and cooperate with the steelmakers and first assistants to eliminate substandard low-temperature steel.

    Steelmaking production requires close cooperation among all types of work. We must hold pre-shift meetings every day to discuss plans, carry out "one-dragon" collaborative competitions, and promptly solve problems that occur in the production process to ensure continuous, balanced, and high output.

    We deeply realize that the more effort we put in, the greater the production potential we can tap. The call of the Party Central Committee has inspired us to even greater effort. We will certainly be able to come up with more ways to increase steel production. Workers on the steel front, let us launch a new competition!

### 让钢产量更大幅度增长

    让钢产量更大幅度增长
    一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动开始了。我们站在炼钢生产的最前线，责任重大而光荣。我们决心以实际行动响应党中央的号召，力争钢的生产有一个更大幅度的增长，保证提前超额完成本小组全年的国家产钢计划。
    现在，盛暑多雨的日子已近尾声，钢铁生产的黄金季节已经到来，正是英雄大显身手的良好时机；同时，煤炭、运输、矿山等各个战线的职工同志们，都围绕钢铁生产掀起了生产新高潮，真是“天助人助”。我们决心大鼓干劲，首先搞好8、9两月的生产，争取钢的日产量在7月份跃进的基础上再提高一大步。
    我们小组的同志认为，进一步提高生产的最直接最有效的办法，是大搞快速炼钢。每个人都搞好本岗位工作，又互相密切配合，分秒必争，就能使生产辅助时间和炼钢时间大大缩短。为了保证钢的质量，经常作到炉炉是好钢，不仅炼钢工和一助手要随时观察炼钢的温度，掌握钢的化学成份，炉前工们也保证随时看温度，配合炼钢工和一助手消灭不合格的低温钢。
    炼钢生产要求各个工种紧密配合。我们每天都要开好班前会，讨论计划，开展“一条龙”协作竞赛，及时解决生产过程中发生的问题，保证持续均衡高产。
    我们深深地体会到，干劲越足，挖出的生产潜力就越大。党中央的号召，把我们的干劲鼓得更高了。我们一定能够想出更多的办法，增产更多的钢。钢铁战线上的工人同志们，让我们展开一场新的竞赛吧！
