　　Rushing to Produce Small Chemical Fertilizer Plant Equipment
　　The electromechanical industry in Guangzhou is rushing to produce thirteen sets of equipment for synthesizing 800 tons of ammonia annually.

    These thirteen sets of equipment will be distributed to Zhanjiang, Jiangmen, Shantou, Shaoguan, Foshan, Hainan, and other places. After these small chemical fertilizer plants are completed, they will provide 10,400 tons of synthetic ammonia to agriculture annually, which can be made into approximately 40,000 tons of ammonia water or ammonium sulfate.

    Fertilizer and Pesticide Production Increases Several Fold
    The staff and workers of the machinery and chemical systems in Guangxi are doing everything possible to produce irrigation and drainage equipment, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides to support agriculture.

    In July, the entire region produced 552 agricultural water pumps, more than 60,000 meters of agricultural irrigation and drainage hoses, more than 30,000 rice transplanters, more than 3,200 tons of chemical fertilizers, and more than 500 tons of pesticides, all of which represented several-fold increases compared to the same period last year.

    The Guixian Calcium Magnesium Phosphate Fertilizer Plant mobilized its staff and workers to use phosphate rock powder, which was previously considered "waste," to produce seven new products, including phosphate fertilizer, ordinary calcium fertilizer, and defluorinated phosphate fertilizer. Many counties, such as Pingguo, Luocheng, and Yulin, also used local materials to build "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" of chemical fertilizer plants on a large scale. By the end of July, Pingguo County alone had built thirteen "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" of chemical fertilizer plants.

    Supporting Agriculture with a Complete Package
    The Jianyang General Machinery Factory in Fujian Province adopts the method of "complete sets going to the countryside, a complete package to the end" to better serve agriculture.

    They cover everything from manufacturing to installation to use. Over the past two years, they have produced various machine tools, gas engines, and a large number of agricultural machinery and agricultural and sideline product processing machinery, so that each commune has an average of about ten machine tools and power machinery. This year, the factory party secretary and director led technical workers to the countryside again, going separately to Shuiji, Masha, and Xushi to install and repair damaged machine tools, power machinery, and processing machinery, so that all the newly added machinery and equipment in the commune's agricultural machinery factories and processing plants were put into production. When equipping the commune's farm tool factories, they matched the main and auxiliary equipment well, so that the machinery and equipment could be quickly installed and put into production.

    After the equipment was sent to the countryside, technical personnel were organized to go to the countryside to help the communes train one hundred technical talents, who have basically mastered the technology of operating and maintaining general machinery.

    With the strong support of the Jianyang General Machinery Factory, the production capacity and technical level of the nine commune-run farm tool factories in the county have rapidly improved. The agricultural machinery factories in Shuiji, Masha, and other communes are now able to manufacture power engines, simple lathes, oil presses, tea kneading machines, and other machinery.

    Supporting Agriculture to the "Edge of the Field"
    Xinhua News Agency report: In order to support the bumper harvest of autumn crops in agriculture more practically, directly, and effectively, the industrial departments of Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, organized all ninety-three county-owned industrial and handicraft units in the county to be linked with thirty-three communes respectively. Based on the original factory-commune linkage, they delineated fields, organized support-agriculture shock brigades, and went all the way to the end, covering until the rice was ripe. They went deep into the countryside and fields, discussed measures to eliminate the three types of seedlings with the cadres and members of the brigades and teams, and carried out shock movements such as weeding, topdressing, drought and flood resistance, and pest and disease control. If the technology and materials needed for agricultural production were insufficient for one factory, several factories would join forces to support it together. After the Huakang Yarn Factory took charge of eighty-eight mu of three types of seedlings in a brigade, Yan Guanshu, the party secretary, led twenty-six workers, carrying tools and self-made fertilizers and pesticides, to the fields as early as five o'clock every morning, and after working continuously for six days, all the rice seedlings had been upgraded. Seeing that more than 300 mu of rice fields in Xiagang Commune were so dry that they had cracked, the comrades of Jiangyin Chemical Fertilizer Plant immediately sent experienced technicians, bringing a 27-horsepower power machine vacated from the plant, to help the commune establish a temporary irrigation station.

    在支援农业的高潮中
    赶制小型化肥厂设备
　　广州市机电行业正在赶制十三套年产八百吨合成氨的设备。
    这十三套设备将分别分配给湛江、江门、汕头、韶关、佛山、海南等地。这些小型化肥厂建成后，每年将为农业提供合成氨一万零四百吨，可制成氨水或硫酸铵约四万多吨。
    化肥农药成倍增长　　广西各地机械和化工系统的职工们，千方百计生产排 灌设备和化肥农药，支援农业。
    七月份全区生产了农业水泵五百五十二台，农业排灌胶管六万多米，插秧机三万多架，化肥三千二百多吨，农药五百多吨，这些产品都比去年同期有成倍的增长。
    贵县钙镁磷肥厂发动职工群众，利用过去被人们认为是“废物”的磷矿石粉，生产磷肥、普通钙肥、脱氟磷肥等七种新产品。平果、罗城、玉林等许多县还就地取材，大建“小土群”、“小洋群”化肥厂。到七月底止，仅平果县就建了化肥“小土群”、“小洋群”十三处。
    支援农业一包到底
    福建省建阳通用机器厂采用“配套下乡，一包到底”的办法，更好地为农业服务。
    他们从包制造开始到包安装包使用。两年来，他们生产了各种机床、煤气机和大批农业机具、农副产品加工机械，使每个公社平均拥有十台左右的机床和动力机械。今年，工厂党委书记、厂长又带领技术工人下乡，分头到水吉、麻沙、徐市，安装和修理损坏的机床、动力机械、加工机械，使各公社农械厂、加工厂新增加的机械设备全部投入生产。给公社农具厂配备设备时，把主次设备搭配好，使机械设备迅速安装，投入生产。
  设备下乡以后，又组织技术人员下乡，帮助公社培养了一百名技术人才，这些人已基本上掌握了操纵和检修一般机械的技术。
    在建阳通用机器厂的大力支援下，全县九个社办农具厂的生产能力和技术水平迅速提高。水吉、麻沙等公社的农械厂，已能制造动力机、简易车床、榨油机、揉茶机等机器了。
    支援农业到“田头”
    江苏江阴县工业部门为了更踏实、更直接、更有效地支援农业秋季作物的丰收，组织全县九十三个县属工业、手工业单位，分别与三十三个公社挂钩。他们以原来厂社挂钩为基础，划定田亩，组织支援农业突击队，一竿子插到底，包到稻熟。他们深入到农村和田间，同大队、小队的干部、社员共同商量消灭三类苗的措施，开展锄草、追肥、抗旱涝、防治病虫害等突击运动。凡是农业生产所需要的技术和物资，如果一厂不足，就几个厂联合起来共同支援。华康纱厂包了一个大队的八十八亩三类苗后，党委书记颜光曙率领二十六个工人，携带了工具和自制的化肥、农药，每天清早五点钟就下田劳动，连续出动六天以后，稻苗已全部升级。江阴化肥厂的同志看到夏港公社有三百多亩稻田干得已经裂缝，立即派了有经验的技工，带了厂里腾出来的一台二十七马力的动力机械，帮助这个公社建立了一个临时灌溉站。　（据新华社讯）
