Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Since the founding of the nation, Chinese opera work has implemented the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend, weeding through the old to bring forth the new, and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. On the basis of critically inheriting the tradition, artistic innovation and creation have been carried out. Therefore, in the garden of Chinese opera art, there has emerged an unprecedentedly prosperous scene of blooming flowers and colorful diversity.

Today, there are more than 400 types of opera appearing on stages across the country, several times more than all the types of opera that existed in the early days of liberation. Hundreds of local operas that were on the verge of extinction or had long disappeared from the stage before liberation have been rejuvenated under the salvation of the Party's literary and art policies. Some local operas, such as Pingju, Yueju, and Yuju, have grown into large opera types that are popular throughout the country. Some local operas with rich content and far-reaching influence, such as Hanju, Qinqiang, and Qiju, have been reformed, fully explored and sorted out their treasures, cultivated new talents, and emitted new brilliance. Some opera types that once withered and declined before liberation, leaving only remnants, such as North and South Kunqu Opera, Hebei Bangzi Opera, Lao Diao Bangzi Opera, Shanxi North Road Bangzi Opera, Puzhou Bangzi Opera, Anhui Hui Opera, Qingyang Tune, Shandong Bangzi Tune, Hubei Qing Opera, Xiangyang, Mianyang, Tianmen Flower Drum, Hunan's Chenhe Opera, Changde Gaoqiang, Fujian Liyuan Opera, Jiangxi Yiyang Tune, etc., under the leadership and care of the Party, and through the efforts of literary and art workers in various places, the remaining sparks have been carefully blown and guided, so that they have regained their vitality and re-emitted vigorous artistic flames. There are also some opera types that have just developed from storytelling arts into stage operas, such as Yongju, Huju, Xiju, and Suju, which have developed from Tanhuang forms; Luju, which has developed from playing the Yangqin; Beijing Quyi Opera, which has developed from Quyi arts; Long Opera, which has developed from Longdong Daoqing; Wanwan Tune, Banban Tune, and Long Opera, which have developed from shadow puppet tunes; Qian Opera, which has developed from Wenqin, etc. All of them have been weeded through the old to bring forth the new, and have developed into independent opera types with a new look in just a few years, and are loved by the broad masses of people.

Simultaneous with the development of opera types, opera workers in various places, under the leadership of the Party committees, have actively carried out the excavation, sorting out, and adaptation of traditional opera repertoires. Up to now, as many as 50,000 traditional repertoires have been excavated nationwide, and a large number of excellent repertoires with considerable ideological and artistic value have been sorted out, adapted, and created, enriching the people's cultural life and playing a beneficial role for the masses. Such as Yue Opera's "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," Sichuan Opera's "Liuyin Ji," "Chunxiang Zhuan," Kunqu Opera's "Fifteen Strings of Cash," Putian Xian Opera's "Father and Son's Hatred" (also known as "After the Reunion"), Beijing Opera's "Wild Boar Forest," "Hunting Tigers," "The Tale of the White Snake," Yu Opera's "Mu Guiying Takes Command," Shangdang Opera's "Three Passes Banquet," Yang Opera's "Centenarian Takes Command," Shandong Bangzi's "Two Wolf Mountain," Dian Opera's "Niu Gao Tears the Decree," Hebei Bangzi and Ping Opera's "Qin Xianglian," Lao Diao's "Pan Yang Lawsuit," Pu Opera's "Xue Gang Rebels Against the Court," Hunan Flower Drum Opera's "Life and Death Plaque," Xiang Opera's "Worship the Moon Record," Qi Opera's "Zhao Jun's Departure from the塞," Cantonese Opera's "Searching the Academy," Qin Opera's "Visiting West Lake," "The Orphan of Zhao," Han Opera's "Second Plum Blossom," Liyuan Opera and Chaozhou Opera's "Chen San Wu Niang," Huangmei Opera's "The Fairy Couple," etc., have all become excellent repertoires that have been frequently performed on stage in recent years, or have been transplanted to other opera types and promoted throughout the country.

The emergence of these excellent traditional repertoires is a great achievement gained by the broad opera workers under the guidance of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new, and critically inheriting the tradition. The excellent traditional repertoires performed since liberation have almost all been weeded through the old to retain the essence by opera workers, and the achievements of the predecessors have been enriched with new ideas and techniques, thus making them take on a new look from content to form, and emit dazzling brilliance.

Using traditional opera forms to express modern themes, to express modern new characters and new life, is also an important aspect of opera weeding through the old to bring forth the new. The achievements in this area are also very gratifying. Such as Yu Opera's "Winter Goes and Spring Comes," Beijing Opera's "Green Plains Red Flag," Qi Opera's "Huang Gonglue," Kunqu Opera's "Red Clouds," Ping Opera's "On the Banks of the Jinsha River," Hu Opera's "Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky," "Sparks of Fire," Yang Opera's "Raging Torrent on the Huangpu River," Xi Opera's "Red Seeds," Cantonese Opera's "Red Flower Ridge," etc., have all respectively expressed the heroic figures who struggled for democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction before and after liberation, reflected the socialist Great Leap Forward, and expressed the life of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The performance of these modern repertoires fully shows that opera is not only good at expressing historical figures, but also capable of happily expressing today's great socialist builders and defenders, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, so that these opera types have gained unprecedented artistic vitality.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: China's Quyi art, with its long history, follows Chairman Mao's direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art, implements the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, and weeding through the old to bring forth the new. Since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, it has presented a new situation of all-round leap forward and vigorous development.

Quyi is a popular folk storytelling art in our country. As early as before the national liberation, the Party gave it enough attention. After liberation, Quyi work has been greatly supported by the Party, Quyi workers have been respected in society, they have actively participated in political struggles, fully exerted their special talents, closely cooperated with the political tasks of various periods, and gone deep into factories, mines, rural areas, and troops, to eat, live, and work with the workers, peasants, and laboring masses, and performed for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, not only directly inspiring the production enthusiasm of the masses, but also improving their own awareness and enriching the themes of creation.

Since liberation, many traditional Quyi works have been excavated and sorted out, and their ideological and artistic value has been improved; many traditional Quyi works that have been buried for a long time have also been rescued, so that they can be used for today's purposes and loved by the people again. Today, the number of known Quyi types in the country has reached about 300. These works are full of the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism.

The large number of new Quyi works is a major feature of Quyi work since the founding of the country. These excellent works vividly reflect the history of the revolution or the life and struggle of various periods after liberation.

In recent years, a large number of amateur Quyi authors and actors have been cultivated in the troops, factories, and rural areas, and thousands of works have been created. They are the reserve force of Quyi.

In line with the creation of Quyi, the music and performing arts of Quyi have also undergone great reforms, and the theory of Quyi has also begun to closely link with reality, focusing on how Quyi serves socialist construction.

### 坚决执行党的文艺政策贯彻为工农兵服务方向  我国戏剧和曲艺艺术百花齐放

    坚决执行党的文艺政策贯彻为工农兵服务方向
    我国戏剧和曲艺艺术百花齐放
    据新华社3日讯　建国以来，我国戏曲工作贯彻百花齐放、百家争鸣、推陈出新为工农兵服务的方针，在批判地继承传统的基础上，进行艺术的革新、创造，因而在全国戏曲艺术的花苑中，出现了群花竞艳，万紫千红的空前繁荣景象。
    今天，全国各地舞台上出现的戏曲剧种已达四百多个。比之解放初期所有的剧种要增多好几倍。解放前濒于绝境或早已绝迹舞台的几百个地方剧种，在党的文艺方针挽救下恢复了青春。评剧、越剧、豫剧等一些地方戏，已壮大成为遍布全国的大剧种；一些蕴藏丰富、影响广远的地方戏如汉剧、秦腔、祁剧等，经过改革，充分发掘和整理了自己的宝藏，培养出了新人，发出了新的光彩。解放前一度雕零枯萎、仅留余息的剧种，如南北昆剧、河北梆子、老调梆子、山西北路梆子、蒲州梆子、安徽徽调、青阳腔、山东梆子腔、湖北清戏、襄阳、沔阳、天门花鼓、湖南的辰河戏、常德高腔、福建梨园戏、江西弋阳腔等，在党的领导和关怀下，经过各地文艺工作者的努力，把残余的星星火种轻吹细引，又使它们恢复了生命力，重新放出旺盛的艺术火焰。还有一些剧种是刚从说唱艺术发展成为舞台戏曲的，如由滩簧形式发展来的甬剧、沪剧、锡剧、苏剧；由打洋琴来的吕剧；由曲艺来的北京曲剧；由陇东道情来的陇剧；由皮影曲调发展的碗碗腔、板板腔、陇剧；由文琴变来的黔剧等等，都是经过推陈出新，在短短几年中发展为声彩焕然的独立剧种，受到广大群众的喜爱。
    与剧种发展的同时，各地戏曲工作者在党委领导下，积极进行了戏曲传统剧目的发掘、整理、改编工作。到目前止，全国范围内已发掘的传统剧目达五万个之多，并整理、改编和创作了大批思想性、艺术性都相当高的优秀剧目，丰富了人民的文化生活，对群众起了有益的作用。如越剧“梁山伯与祝英台”、川剧“柳荫记”、“春香传”、昆曲“十五贯”、莆仙戏“父子恨”（一名“团圆之后”）、京剧“野猪林”、“猎虎记”、“白蛇传”、豫剧“穆桂英挂帅”、上党戏“三关排宴”、扬剧“百岁挂帅”、山东梆子“两狼山”、滇剧“牛皋扯旨”、河北梆子和评剧“秦香莲”、老调“潘杨讼”、蒲剧“薛刚反朝”、湖南花鼓戏“生死牌”、湘剧“拜月记”、祁剧“昭君出塞”、粤剧“搜书院”、秦腔“游西湖”、“赵氏孤儿”、汉剧“二度梅”、梨园戏和潮州戏“陈三五娘”、黄梅戏“天仙配”等等，都已成为这些年来在舞台上经常演出、或被移植到其他剧种、推广到全国的优秀剧目。
    这些优秀传统剧目的出现，是广大戏曲工作者在百花齐放、推陈出新方针指导下，批判地继承传统所获得的巨大成绩。解放以来所上演的优秀传统剧目，几乎都是经过戏曲工作者们去芜存菁，并以新的思想、技巧丰富了前人的成就，因而使它们从内容到形式都焕然一新，发出了夺目的光彩。
    运用传统戏曲形式表现现代题材，表现现代的新人物、新生活，也是戏曲推陈出新的一个重要方面。这方面的成就也是十分可喜的。如豫剧的“冬去春来”、京剧“绿原红旗”、祁剧“黄公略”、昆剧“红霞”、评剧“金沙江畔”、沪剧“鸡毛飞上天”、“星星之火”，扬剧“黄浦江激流”、锡剧“红色的种子”，粤剧“红花岗”等等，都分别表现了解放前后为民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设而斗争的英雄人物，反映了社会主义大跃进，表现了工农兵生活。这些现代剧目的演出，充分说明戏曲不仅善于表现历史人物，也能胜任愉快地表现今天伟大的社会主义建设者和捍卫者工农兵，使这些剧种获得了前所未有的艺术生命力。
    据新华社3日讯　有着悠久历史的我国曲艺艺术，遵循着毛主席文艺为工农兵服务的方向，贯彻了百花齐放，推陈出新的方针，解放以来，特别是1958年大跃进以来，呈现了全面跃进蓬勃发展的崭新局面。
    曲艺是我国民间久已流行的说唱艺术。远在全国解放以前，党就对它给以足够的重视。解放以后，曲艺工作更受到党的大力扶植，曲艺工作者受到社会上的尊重，他们积极参加政治斗争，充分发挥了自己的特长，紧密地配合各时期的政治任务，深入到工厂、矿山、农村、部队中去，和工农劳动群众同吃同住同劳动，为工农兵演出，不仅直接鼓舞了群众的生产热情，而且提高了自己的觉悟，丰富了创作题材。
    解放以来，许多传统曲艺作品经过发掘、整理，提高了思想性和艺术性；许多久已埋没的传统曲艺作品，也被挽救过来，使之古为今用，重新为人民所喜爱。今天，全国已知的曲种，已达约三百个。这些作品中充满了革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的成分。
    新曲艺作品大量涌现是建国以来曲艺工作的一大特点。这些优秀作品都生动地反映了革命史或解放后各个时期的生活斗争。
    几年来，在部队、工厂、农村中已培养出大批业余的曲艺作者和演员，创作了上千上万的作品，他们是曲艺的后备军。
    与曲艺创作相适应，曲艺的音乐和表演艺术也有了很大的改革，曲艺的理论也以研究曲艺如何为社会主义建设服务为中心，开始密切联系实际。
