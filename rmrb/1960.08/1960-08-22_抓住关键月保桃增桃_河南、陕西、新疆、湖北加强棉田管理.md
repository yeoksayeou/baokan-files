Xinhua News Agency report: The broad masses of people's commune members in the cotton-producing areas of Henan are seizing this final crucial month for increasing flower buds and protecting cotton bolls. They are adopting different measures based on the varying growth conditions of cotton to strengthen cotton field management, striving to secure the bolls of summer, seize the bolls of autumn, and achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest in cotton fields.

To date, cotton fields in Henan have generally been weeded twice, with some areas weeded three to four times. Over 80% of the cotton fields have been top-dressed with fertilizer. Thanks to meticulous management, cotton is generally growing well across the region, with early boll setting, abundant summer bolls, dense flower buds and bolls, and reduced shedding. However, due to differences in management, growth conditions remain uneven, and some third-class cotton fields still exist in various areas. To strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest, various localities have recently focused on second and third-class cotton fields, strengthening late-stage management of all cotton fields. In major cotton-producing areas such as Xinxiang, Kaifeng, and Luoyang, counties have identified much potential for increased production through cotton field ranking, visits, comparisons, and exchange of experiences. For first-class cotton fields, measures have been taken to primarily prevent pests, prune and top at appropriate times, and apply appropriate amounts of fertilizer to reduce shedding, increase boll weight, and lay the foundation for autumn boll development. For second and third-class cotton fields, quick-acting fertilizers are applied generously, weeds are eliminated, and cotton plants are strengthened to prevent premature aging and promote the formation of more autumn bolls.

In striving for balanced and comprehensive cotton field production, various localities have promoted advanced leadership methods and field management experience. Cadres leading cotton production in Lingbao County, Luoyang Prefecture, have adopted the leadership method of "walking within the area, looking outside the area, and connecting the inside and outside." They have rapidly promoted the technical experience of managing high-yield fields to the management of general fields, with good results. The cotton field inspection team of the prefecture summarized this leadership method and immediately promoted it throughout the area.

Xinhua News Agency report: People's communes in cotton-producing areas of Shaanxi Province have re-revised cotton field management measures based on the new characteristics of cotton growth this year, strengthening mid- and late-stage cotton field management to ensure a bumper harvest.

This year, due to drought in Shaanxi Province, cotton plants have not experienced excessive vegetative growth. Cotton seedlings have generally been well-stunted, with numerous and deep roots, and good development of reproductive organs and great potential. Although the "Beginning of Autumn" has passed, cotton in both irrigated and dryland areas throughout the province generally shows no leaf drop or red leaves. This situation provides extremely favorable conditions for striving to increase fruiting branches, flower buds, cotton bolls, and boll weight. People's communes in various areas have formulated cotton field management measures centered on water and fertilizer supplementation and pruning based on these conditions. The effectiveness of these measures is significant. According to typical surveys, general cotton plants have grown new fruiting branches within seven to eight days, increasing by five flower buds and three cotton bolls.

Various localities have also improved the pruning techniques for irrigated and dryland cotton based on the new cotton growth conditions this year. In the irrigated areas of the Weihe Canal, Jinghe Canal, and Luohe Canal, the fruiting branches in the lower part of cotton plants are short due to early drought. After later rainfall, the fruiting branches in the middle layer developed very well, and the upper branches and leaves are also quite lush. For this reason, commune members prune the cotton plants into a spindle shape that is narrow at the top and bottom and thick in the middle. That is, they mainly prune the upper part of the cotton, so that the shorter upper fruiting branches can produce large bolls while facilitating ventilation and light penetration, reducing boll shedding of the entire cotton plant.

Xinhua News Agency report: People's communes and military reclamation farms in cotton-producing areas of Xinjiang are taking advantage of the victory of the summer harvest to concentrate their efforts on mid- and late-stage cotton field management, striving for a bumper cotton harvest.

In the midst of the intense summer harvest, Xinjiang generally retained 15% to 20% of the labor force to insist on field management of cotton and other crops. Now that the summer harvest in the entire region has basically ended, the labor force participating in the summer harvest has rapidly transferred to the cotton field management front, centering on cultivation, weeding, watering, top-dressing, and pest and disease control, setting off a new upsurge in cotton field management. In Hotan Prefecture and Turpan County, where the summer harvest ended earlier, 50% to 60% of the labor force has been invested in field management activities for cotton and other crops. Various localities have classified and ranked cotton fields, providing priority top-dressing with quick-acting fertilizers to third-class seedlings based on different cotton growth conditions to promote the upgrading of third-class seedlings. For first and second-class seedlings, late-stage management to protect flower buds and cotton bolls has been strengthened, and efforts have been made to apply phosphorus fertilizer. Through careful management, cotton is growing better and better in various areas.

Xinhua News Agency report: Striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of cotton with numerous and large cotton bolls, cotton-producing areas of Hubei Province are focusing on the late-stage cultivation and management of cotton fields to "protect the summer bolls and increase autumn bolls."

After the "Beginning of Autumn," there is still much to be done to promote increased cotton production if field management is strengthened. Based on this experience, people in the cotton-producing areas have broken the established mindset of "everything stops after the Beginning of Autumn." With top-dressing and pest control as the center, combined with soil loosening, root hilling, pruning, and side shoot removal, they have set off a high tide of late-stage cotton field management. In addition to applying two top-dressings to 90% of the cotton fields, Huanggang Prefecture has also applied four to five top-dressings to cotton fields that are not growing well enough.

Striving for third-class seedlings to produce more autumn bolls is an important aspect of the late-stage cotton field management work in various areas. Henglin Commune in Tianmen County organized more than 11,000 laborers to apply more fertilizer to third-class cotton seedlings. At present, many have reached the standards required for first-class seedlings and high-yield fields.

To make cotton field cultivation and management more and more meticulous, leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the front lines, promptly organizing evaluations and inspections to identify and solve problems. (Attached picture)

Members of the Xinxing Production Team of the Dabaichi Commune in Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, received more than 30 cotton planting experts in the "World's Champion Cotton High-Yield Field." They came from the Cixian Chengan Commune and Zhanghedian Commune to visit, learn, and offer treasures. This is a picture of the leading cadres of the three communes introducing methods of managing cotton and working experience of high-yield fields to each other in the cotton high-yield field.

    抓住关键月保桃增桃
    河南、陕西、新疆、湖北加强棉田管理
    据新华社讯　河南产棉区广大人民公社社员，正抓紧当前增蕾保桃的最后一个关键月，针对棉花生长不同情况，采取不同措施，加强棉田管理，力保伏桃，大夺秋桃，争取棉田全面丰产。）
    到目前止，河南棉田已经普遍锄过两遍，一部分锄了三遍到四遍，80％以上的棉田追施了肥料，由于管理细致，各地棉花普遍生长良好，一般都座桃早，伏桃多、蕾铃密、脱落少。但是，由于管理不同，生长情况也不平衡，各地仍然有一部分三类棉田。为了争取全面丰产，最近，各地都以二、三类棉田为主，对全部棉田加强了后期管理。新乡、开封、洛阳等主要产棉专区各县，通过棉田排队、参观评比和交流经验，挖出了许多增产潜力。对一类棉田，针对桃多、株旺的特点，采取了严防虫害为主、适时整枝打顶、适量追施肥料的措施，以减少蕾铃脱落，增加桃重，同时，也为秋桃盖顶打下了基础。对二、三类棉田就大施速效肥，铲除杂草，捉使棉株健壮发育，防止早衰，多结秋桃。
    各地在争取棉田平衡丰产中，都推广了先进的领导方法和田间管理经验。洛阳专区灵宝等县领导棉花生产的干部，采取“方内走、方外看，方内方外一条线”的领导方法，把管理棉花丰产方的技术的经验，迅速推广到一般田的管理上去，效果很好，专区棉田检查团总结了这种领导方法后，立即在全区普遍推广。
    据新华社讯　陕西产棉区各公社根据今年棉花生长的新特点，重新增订棉田管理措施，加强了棉田中后期管理，确保棉花丰收。
    今年，陕西省由于气候干旱，棉株没有疯长现象。棉花普遍蹲苗好，群根多，主根深，生殖器管发育好，后劲大。目前虽已立秋，全省水地、旱地棉花，普遍无落叶、无红叶。这种情况，给争取增加果枝、增蕾增桃和增加桃重提供了极为有利的条件，各地人民公社都根据这些情况制订了以加水加肥和整枝为中心的棉田管理措施。这些措施的成效显著。据典型调查，一般棉花在七、八天内都生了新果枝，增长了五个花蕾和三个棉桃。
    各地还根据今年棉花生长的新情况，改进了水地、旱地棉花的整枝技术。渭惠渠、泾惠渠、洛惠渠灌区的水地棉花，由于前期干旱，根部的果枝短，后期降雨后，中层的果枝发育很好，上部枝叶也相当茂密。为此，社员们就把棉株整成上下尖中间粗的纱锭形，即主要对棉花上部进行整枝，上部的果枝短，既能结大桃，又便于通风透光，减少整个棉株的蕾铃脱落。
    据新华社讯　新疆各产棉区人民公社和军垦农场正乘夏收大捷之势，集中力量进行棉田中、晚期管理，力争棉花丰收。
    新疆各地在紧张的夏收中，一般都留15％到20％的劳力，坚持棉花及其它作物的田间管理。现全区夏收已基本结束，各产棉区参加夏收的劳力已迅速转上棉田管理战线，以中耕除草、浇水、追肥和防治病虫害为中心，掀起了棉田管理新高潮。夏收结束较早的和田专区和吐鲁番县，已有50%到60％的劳力投入棉田及其它作物的田间管理活动。各地都对棉田进行分类排队，按棉花生长不同情况，首先给三类苗偏追速效肥，促使三类苗升级，对一、二类苗，主要是加强了保蕾保桃的后期管理，抓紧追施磷肥。经过精心管理，各地棉花都越长越好。
    据新华社讯　争取棉花桃多、桃大全面丰收，湖北省各产棉区大抓“保伏桃、增秋桃”的棉田后期培育管理。
    “立秋”以后，只要加强田间管理，在促进棉花增产上还大有可为。根据这一经验，各产棉区人民打破了“立了秋万事休”的定局思想，以追肥、治虫为中心，结合进行松土培根，整枝打杈，掀起了棉田后期管理高潮。黄冈专区除了90％的棉田施了二次追肥以外，并给长得不够好的棉田分别施了四次到五次追肥。
    力争三类苗多结秋桃，是各地棉田后期管理工作中的一个重要环节。天门县横林公社组织了一万一千多劳力，对三类棉苗增施了肥。目前，已有许多分别达到了一类苗和丰产方要求的标准。
    为了使棉田培育管理愈做愈细，各级领导干部都深入第一线，及时组织评比检查，发现问题、解决问题。（附图片）
    河月省高阳县大百尺公社新兴生产队的社员们，在“举世魁元棉花丰产方”里接侍了三十多植棉能手，他们是从磁县成安公社和漳河店公社前来参观访问、取经献宝的。这是三个公社的领导干部在棉花丰产方马互相介绍管理棉花的办法和领导丰产方的工作经验。李　诚摄（新华社稿）
