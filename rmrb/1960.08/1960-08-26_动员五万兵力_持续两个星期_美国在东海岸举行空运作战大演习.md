　　The United States military authorities began their largest airborne operation exercise since World War II near Fort Bragg military base on the east coast of the United States on the 20th. The troops directly participating in this exercise are more than 8,000 paratroopers from the U.S. 101st Airborne Division. By the 23rd, they will also receive "support" from 3,600 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division. The "battlefield" of the exercise will include the scope of five states, involving more than 50,000 troops. The exercise will last two weeks.
　　The troops participating in this exercise are all under the U.S. Strategic Army Command. According to a report from United Press International, this command was established two years ago to prepare for launching "limited wars" like the Korean War. The commander of this military exercise is Herbert Powell, commander of the U.S. Third Army.

    美国在东海岸举行空运作战大演习
    美国军事当局从20日开始在美国东海岸布拉哥堡军事基地附近举行第二次大战以来规模最大的一次空运作战演习。直接参加这次演习的部队是美国第一○一空运师的八千多名伞兵。到23日，他们还将得到第八十二空运师的三千六百名伞兵的“支援”。演习的“战场”将包括五个州的范围，牵扯的部队将达五万多人。演习将持续两星期。
    参加这次演习的部队都是隶属于美国战略陆军司令部，据合众国际社消息说，这个司令部是在两年以前为了准备发动像侵朝战争那样的“有限战争”而成立的。指挥这次军事演习的是美国陆军第三军司令赫伯特·鲍威尔。
