    Launch a Concentrated Effort to Tackle Equipment Maintenance
    Chen Zhiyan
    The continuous development of production is the result of constantly overcoming various obstacles to production. In our struggle against various difficulties, we have gradually come to understand and master the laws of production, aligning our subjective efforts with objective reality, and continuously propelling production forward.
    Currently, many enterprises are launching "concentrated efforts," which is a measure based on combining revolutionary drive with scientific analysis to concretely solve key problems in production by focusing resources in a down-to-earth manner.
    In doing anything, one may encounter some difficulties and have to overcome some "hurdles." Developing industry is no exception. Hurdles stand in our way, hindering our progress. But overcoming these hurdles allows us to advance rapidly and deeply, winning victory. Generally, those that become hurdles are solid "fortresses" that cannot be easily overcome and require concentrated effort to conquer. However, the question lies in how to identify those that are truly important "hurdles." This is crucial, because only when you recognize them can you decide to "deploy troops" and mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to overcome them. Currently, in the industrial front, some "hurdles" are valued by everyone, such as raw material hurdles, technology hurdles, quality hurdles, and so on. However, there is another hurdle, namely the equipment maintenance hurdle, which has not been recognized by all enterprises, or even if it has been recognized, it has not been given sufficient importance. This situation is related to one-sidedness in thinking. Some comrades feel that if the raw material hurdle is not broken, the growth of production will certainly be affected; if the technology hurdle is not broken, it will be difficult for production to increase substantially; if the quality hurdle is not broken, even if the quantity increases a lot, the quality is not good, and it cannot be considered as completing the plan. However, regarding equipment maintenance, they feel that this is a small matter and not very important, especially when the equipment is still running smoothly temporarily, they feel that there is no problem, and even if there are some minor problems, they think it does not matter much and do not pay attention to timely maintenance. This is where the problem lies. As the saying goes, "A stitch in time saves nine," although equipment cannot speak, if you do not take care of it, it will give you trouble, and if you want to increase production, it will refuse to do so.
    Equipment maintenance is also a hurdle, and an important one for ensuring normal production and continuous growth of production. It should not be taken lightly. Overcoming this hurdle provides an extra guarantee for the leap forward in production. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company achieved a significant increase in steel, iron, coke, refractory materials, and other products because it organized a concentrated effort to maintain equipment, which shows that it is a major event.
    Of course, equipment maintenance is a task that requires constant attention, and there should be a maintenance system to ensure the continuous and normal operation of equipment. However, like the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, launching the masses in a down-to-earth manner to concentrate on equipment maintenance, and launching a concentrated effort to maintain equipment, is also very necessary to ensure a greater increase in industrial production with steel as the key link in the second half of the year.

    打一次设备维修的攻关战	陈之衍
    生产的不断发展，是不断克服对生产的各种阻碍的结果。我们在和各种困难作斗争中，逐步认识了、掌握了生产规律，使我们的主观和客观一致，把生产不断向前推进。
    现在，在许多企业中，都在打“攻关战”，这就是在革命干劲和科学分析相结合的基础上，踏踏实实地，集中力量具体解决生产中关键问题的一种措施。
    办任何事情，都可能遇到一些困难，要过一些“关”。办工业也不例外。关，横在我们的前面，阻碍我们前进。但攻破这个关口，就能长驱直入，向纵深发展，赢得胜利。大体上，凡成为关者，必是一些坚固的“堡垒”，不是轻而易举就能攻克的，而必须集中力量才能拿下它。可是问题在于如何识别那些是真正重要的“关口”。这一点很要紧，因为你认识了它，才能下决心去“调兵遣将”，调动广大群众的积极性和创造性去攻破它。现在，在工业战线上，有些“关”，是大家都重视了的，比如，原料关、技术关、质量关等等。但是还有一关，即设备维修关，还没有被所有的企业所认识，或者虽然有了认识，还不是那样十分重视。这种情况和思想上的片面性有关。有些同志觉得：不破原料关，生产的增长当然就要受到影响；不破技术关，生产大幅度上升也有困难；不破质量关，数量上虽然增长不少，质量不好，也不能算完成计划。可是，对于设备维修，就觉得这是一件小事，并不见得多么重要，特别是当设备暂时还运转得顺利的时候，更觉得没有什么问题了，就是出了点小毛病，也认为没有大关系，不注意及时维修。问题就出在这里。常言道：“小洞不补，大洞吃苦”，设备虽然不会讲话，可是你不爱护它，到时候就会给你苦头吃，你想要把生产长上去，它就偏偏不上去。
    设备维修，这也是一关，而且是保证正常生产和生产不断增长的重要一关，可不要等闲视之。破了这一关，生产的跃进，就多了一重保障。太原钢铁公司就是因为组织了一次设备维修的攻关战，钢、铁、焦炭、耐火材料等产品都有了很大增长，可见这是一件大事。
    当然，设备维修，是一件需要经常注意的工作，而且应当有维修的制度，保证设备不间断地正常运转。但是像太原钢铁公司那样，踏踏实实地发动群众集中力量检修一次设备，打一次检修设备的攻关战，这对于保证下半年以钢为纲的工业生产有更大的增长，也是十分必要的。
