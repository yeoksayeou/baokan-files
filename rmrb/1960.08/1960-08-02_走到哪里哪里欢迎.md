    Welcomed Wherever They Go
    "Break out of the service station and go to the factories to mend clothes and repair shoes for the worker comrades!" This is the action slogan of the employees of the Tianxingxiang Repair Service Station on Huashan Road, Shanghai.
    This station has more than twenty repairmen who handle more than eighty repair services. Although they are very busy, they think that the workers are even busier than they are, having to produce, innovate technically, and study culture every day. No matter how busy the repair station is, they must try every possible means to send people out to provide repair services on-site.
    For the past six months, almost every day, several of them have been pushing labor carts, carrying sewing machines and all the tools for repairing shoes, rubber shoes, etc., to the factories to take on work. They repair whatever the worker comrades bring out. In the past six months, they have repaired more than 3,500 items. Now, they are welcomed wherever they go.

    走到哪里哪里欢迎
    “跳出服务站，到工厂去为工人同志补衣服、修皮鞋！”这是上海华山路天兴祥修配服务站职工的行动口号。
    这个站有二十多个修配员，担负着八十多项修配业务。尽管业务十分繁忙，但是，他们想到工人们每天要生产、技术革新，还要学文化，比他们还忙。修配站再忙也要千方百计抽出人来，把修配服务送上门去。
    半年来，他们几乎每天都有几个人，推着劳动车，带着缝纫机和修皮鞋、胶鞋等全副工具，到工厂去揽活。工人同志拿出什么东西来就修什么。半年中，下厂修好了三千五百多件用品。现在，他们到哪里，哪里都欢迎。
