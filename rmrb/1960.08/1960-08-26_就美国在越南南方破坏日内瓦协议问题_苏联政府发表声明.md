Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 25th: The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that the increase of American military personnel and equipment in South Vietnam cannot but lead to a further sharpening of the situation in Indochina. "Under these circumstances, an appeal by the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina (the Soviet Union and Great Britain) to the United States government to abide by the Geneva Accords would be of great significance for strengthening peace and security in Indochina and Southeast Asia."

The statement pointed out that in view of the United States' policy of turning South Vietnam into a military strategic base for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, shipping weapons and ammunition to South Vietnam and sending more and more military personnel there, and in view of the protest notes lodged by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam against these actions by the United States, the Soviet government had already sent a note to the British government on May 30 of this year. In the note, the Soviet government expressed its concern about the continued violation of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam, stating: "The increase in the number of American military advisors in South Vietnam is one such violation."

The Soviet government suggested that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference send a letter to the US government, calling for a halt to the increase in the number of US military advisors in South Vietnam, and discussing their withdrawal from there.

From the British government's reply recently received, it can be seen that the British government has refused to accept the Soviet government's proposal for the two chairmen to take joint action aimed at stopping the continued violation of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam.

    就美国在越南南方破坏日内瓦协议问题
    苏联政府发表声明
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科25日讯：苏联外交部发表声明说，在越南南方的美国军事人员和军备的增加，不能不引起印度支那局势的进一步尖锐化。“在这种情况下，印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两位主席（苏联和英国）呼吁美国政府遵守日内瓦协议，将会对加强印度支那和东南亚的和平和安全具有重大的意义”。
    声明指出，鉴于美国奉行变越南南方为东南亚条约组织的军事战略基地的政策，向越南南方运送武器和弹药并向那里派遣越来越多的军事人员，鉴于越南民主共和国政府就美国的这种行动所提出的抗议照会，苏联政府在今年5月30日就曾向英国政府提出了照会。在照会中，苏联政府对继续破坏关于越南的日内瓦协议一事表示忧虑，声明说：“在越南南方的美国军事顾问团人员的增加，就是这种破坏行为”。
    苏联政府建议，日内瓦会议的两位主席致函美国政府，呼吁停止增加美国在越南南方的军事顾问团的人员，以及讨论他们从那里撤出的问题。
    从不久前所收到的英国政府复照中可以看出，英国政府拒绝接受苏联政府关于两位主席采取旨在制止继续破坏关于越南的日内瓦协议的共同行动的建议。
