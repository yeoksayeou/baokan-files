Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 16th: As a result of the Nanjing Jiangdong Coking Plant's employees finding ways to increase raw coal utilization, the raw coal consumed per ton of coke has been reduced from three tons to 2.1 tons. Since the beginning of this year, they have increased coke production for the country by more than 1,400 tons through conserving raw coal, powerfully supporting the continuous leap forward in the steel industry.

As soon as you enter this factory, you can see that everything is well-organized, and the grounds are clean and tidy, looking like a well-kept granary. Although an average of 5,000 tons of coal and coke enter and exit the factory every month, you can't see any spilled coal particles or coke dust at the wharf or on the roads. Except for a section of road near the coal washing plant and the coal piles, the soil on the entire factory site and roads remains its original dark brown and yellow color. It is particularly noticeable that the kilns that have just finished coking are also clean and tidy, and no coke particles can be seen on the long kiln lanes.

Loving coal like grain has become the prevailing atmosphere in this factory. From leading cadres to every worker, all the factory's employees have developed a good habit of cherishing state property. Here, people can see the factory's leading cadres picking up coke lumps dropped on the road and sweeping up coal dust scattered on the road. Workers pour water on the coal to prevent coal particles from being blown away by the wind.

The coking workers insist on sweeping the coal storage areas and coal transportation roads once a day for minor cleaning and once a week for major cleaning. If coal dust gets trapped in the mud, they use shovels to dig it out.

In order to improve the utilization rate of raw coal, the employees also launched a major technological innovation. The Party branch secretary and the factory director, together with the employees, jointly designed and built a new type of coking kiln. The coke produced by this new kiln is not only of good quality, but also has a coke yield that is 16% higher than that of the old kiln. They also use coke dust to produce coke balls to meet the needs of blast furnaces. Even the coal slurry in the settling ponds, which used to be treated as waste, has been fully utilized by them by finding the right approach.

### 江东炼焦厂爱煤如爱粮  今年以来用节约的原煤增产了一千四百多吨焦炭

    江东炼焦厂爱煤如爱粮
    今年以来用节约的原煤增产了一千四百多吨焦炭
    新华社南京16日电　南京江东炼焦厂职工多方设法提高原煤利用率的结果，炼一吨焦耗用的原煤已经由三吨降低到二点一吨。今年以来他们靠节约出的原煤为国家增产了一千四百多吨焦，有力地支援了钢铁工业的持续跃进。
    一走进这个工厂，就可以看到处处搞得秩序井然，场地打扫得整整洁洁，看上去像一个保管得很好的粮仓。尽管一个月平均有五千吨煤、焦从厂里进进出出，但是在码头边，在大道上，看不到什么遗漏的煤粒、焦屑，除了洗煤场近旁和煤堆边的一段道路以外，整个工厂场地和道路的泥土毫不变色，仍然是深褐带黄；特别引人注意的是，那些出完焦不久的窑里，也是清清爽爽，在长长的窑巷上看不到焦炭颗粒。
    爱煤如爱粮，已经成为这个工厂的风气。从领导干部到每个工人，全厂职工人人都养成了珍惜国家资财的良好习惯。在这里，人们可以看到厂里的领导干部把丢在路上的焦块拾回来，把撒到路上的煤屑扫起来。工人们怕煤粒被风刮走，就在煤上泼水。
    对堆煤场所和运煤的道路，炼焦工人坚持一天一小扫，一周一大扫。有的煤屑陷到泥里去了，他们就用铁铲铲出来。
    职工们为了提高原煤利用率，还开展了技术大革新。党支部书记和厂长等同职工一道，共同设计和建造了一种新型的炼焦窑。这种新窑炼出的焦不但质量好，而且出焦率比旧窑提高了16％。他们还利用焦屑等烧制焦球供应高炉需要。就是在沉淀池里一向当作废料处理的煤泥，他们也找出窍门充分利用了起来。
