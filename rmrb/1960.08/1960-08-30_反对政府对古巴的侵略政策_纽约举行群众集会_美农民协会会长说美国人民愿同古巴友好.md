Xinhua News Agency, August 29th News: New York - Disregarding threats from American police, New York residents held a mass rally in Union Square, New York, on the evening of the 27th to oppose American aggression against Cuba.

Three hundred people participated in the demonstration. The American government dispatched three hundred and ten police officers to threaten and monitor the demonstrating masses.

Xinhua News Agency, August 29th News: According to TASS, New York, August 28th - President of the American Farmers Union, Stover, wrote a letter to U.S. President Eisenhower, criticizing the U.S. policy towards the Republic of Cuba.

The letter, published in "American Agricultural News," stated: "We are writing this letter to express our dissatisfaction with your policy towards Cuba. Today, at our council meeting, it was decided to lodge a firm protest against economic boycott measures such as reducing the quota for Cuban sugar imports. However, what makes the council even more uneasy is the poorly disguised (American) military threat to Prime Minister Fidel Castro's government."

Stover said in the letter that Cuba certainly needs land reform, and its action of nationalizing certain major enterprises can hardly be considered a justified reason for subjecting Cuba to the kind of hostile, diplomatic bombardment it is currently suffering.

Stover sarcastically said that a government that has just been caught red-handed engaging in serious deception in international affairs can hardly be said to be suitable for giving political lessons to the Cuban government that is fighting heroically to free its people from the oppression and exploitation of foreign monopoly capital.

He emphasized: "We want to live peacefully and friendly with the Cuban people, and we hope that our government will represent us, not some cruel monopolists who want to exploit Cuban labor and resources."

    反对政府对古巴的侵略政策
    纽约举行群众集会
    美农民协会会长说美国人民愿同古巴友好
    新华社29日讯　纽约消息：纽约居民不顾美国警察的威胁，27日晚在纽约联合广场举行了反对美国侵略古巴的群众集会。
    参加这次示威的有三百人。美国政府却出动了三百一十名警察对示威的群众进行威胁和监视。
    据新华社29日讯　据塔斯社纽约28日讯：美国农民协会会长斯图弗写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔，指责美国对古巴共和国的政策。
    刊登在“美国农业新闻”上的这封信写道：“我们写这封信，是为了表示不满你对古巴的政策。今天在我们的理事会会议上，决定对削减古巴食糖进口限额之类的经济抵制措施提出坚决的抗议。但是，使理事会甚至更加不安的，是拙劣地掩饰起来的（美国）对菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理政府的军事威胁。”
    斯图弗在信中说，古巴肯定需要土地改革，而它把某些主要企业收归国有的行动也很难被认为有理由对古巴进行像它目前所遭受的那种仇视性的、外交性的轰炸。
    斯图弗以讥讽的口吻说，美国政府由于在国际事务中进行严重的欺骗而刚刚被当场捉住，这样一个政府很难说它适合于给那个使本国人民摆脱外国垄断资本的压迫和剥削而英勇斗争的古巴政府上政治课。
    他强调说：“我们希望同古巴人民和平和友好地生活，我们希望，我们的政府将代表我们，而不是代表某些希望剥削古巴劳动力和资源的残忍的垄断资本。”
