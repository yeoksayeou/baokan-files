    Three Stars Shine, Hall is Red
    – A Record of the First Battle of the Increased Production and Thrift Campaign at the No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company
    Chonggang Party Committee Writing Group
    "August 15th, Shine Brightly!" – This is the resounding call made by the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee to the steelworkers. The provincial and municipal Party committees demanded that steelworkers begin on August 15th, using new achievements in high quality and high production to invest in the increased production and thrift movement centered on grain and steel. This call was like a storm stirring up huge waves, arousing rolling tides in the hearts of every steelworker at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. The hearts of the steelworkers were boiling! Chonggang was filled with an excited mood, firm confidence, and the indomitable spirit combined into surging waves!…

    Relying on the enormous encouraging power of the Party's call, and relying on the steelworkers' ambition that far surpasses the raging fire, on this day, the daily steel output of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company greatly exceeded the average daily output level since July and August; and the No. 3 open hearth furnace, with its excellent achievement of producing three furnaces of steel per day, with an output increase of 75.48% over the average daily output from August 1st to 14th, overfulfilled the state plan and achieved a complete red victory.

    The First Song of Triumph

    August 14th, night, ten thousand lights in the steel city, half the sky a fiery red. In the study room of the No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop, Comrade Zhang Qingxiang, a large group of Party branch secretaries, was making a mobilization report for "Shine Brightly":

    "...Achieving high production and high quality on the 15th is our practical demonstration of responding to the Party's call for increased production and thrift. Our shift is the first shift to produce on the 15th. Whether we can make a good start depends on the task on our shoulders. Recently, the average smelting time per furnace has been more than eleven hours, but we must do everything possible to conquer eight o'clock..."

    Before the secretary's words could finish, Zeng Yunfang, the smelting shift leader of the No. 3 open hearth furnace, rang out with a voice like a bronze gong: "Eight o'clock? We guarantee within eight o'clock!"

    "Good!" Zhang Qingxiang swept his eyes over the crowd: "Everyone see..."

    "Guarantee a constant supply of raw materials!"
    "Guarantee that the back of the furnace will not affect the front of the furnace!"
    "Guarantee a sufficient supply of gas!"
        "..."

    Yes! Ever since the Party issued the call to launch the increased production and thrift movement centered on grain and steel, the steelworkers' passion had long been unable to be restrained. The secretary called for breaking eight o'clock for smelting time and seizing high production and high quality, how could everyone not rush forward and give it their all? Soon, the heated atmosphere of the meeting spread to the steelmaking platform.

    As soon as the shift started, the back of the furnace began to tap molten iron. Zeng Yunfang clearly knew the crucial role of this process in shortening the smelting time. He hurried to the back of the furnace.

    At this moment, the molten iron trough splashed with ten thousand sparks, and the temperature of thousands of degrees made it impossible for people to get close.

    "Is there enough molten iron?" The smelting shift leader looked up and greeted the top.

    "Enough, it's about to be completely tapped!" A familiar voice came from above.

    "Hey! Is Secretary Zhang performing?" Old Zeng asked busily.

    "Haha, just trying it out."

    "Secretary Zhang's 'double car molten iron tapping' is guaranteed to shorten the time by half!" Cai Shihua, the molten iron dispatcher, continued from above.

    Just as he was speaking, it came from above: "Tapped out!"

    Below immediately reported: "Total length of eighteen minutes!"

    "New record!" The molten iron dispatcher shouted excitedly from above.

    "Sixty minutes shortened to eighteen minutes." Old Zeng calculated with glee, ticking off his fingers, "Wow, shortened so much, never before!"

    The smelting shift leader quickly turned to the front of the furnace and worked closely with his comrades. The raging furnace fire was not something to fear for the heroes, but something to be happy about, because the bigger the fire, the higher the temperature, the faster the steelmaking.

    "The first steel sample is here!" The chemical analyst reported quickly.

    "What is the carbon content?" The smelting shift leader asked.

    "1.32%!"

    "1.32%?!" Zeng Yunfang was secretly startled. The carbon content of qualified steel cannot exceed 0.22%. Obviously, it would be very difficult to reduce the carbon.

    "Eight hours is not enough to reduce the carbon content!" Some people lost confidence in breaking the eight o'clock barrier.

    "This won't do!" Zeng Yunfang (who was also the Party group leader) immediately convened a Party group meeting by the furnace.

    "First of all, we must unify our thinking and strengthen our confidence!" "We must take the lead in taking emergency action!"…

    The Party members expressed their opinions separately and finally decided to: spread the word about the favorable conditions to everyone, encourage the enthusiasm of the masses; technically, immediately add ore and lime to urgently reduce carbon.

    Thinking was unified. After the ore and lime entered the furnace, slagging began immediately. Zeng Yunfang waved his hoe, crossed the furnace door in one step, took the lead in overcoming the high temperature, stirred and scraped the slag, and accelerated the slag flow rate. Hu Bingquan, the chairman of the trade union, and other comrades in the shift also rushed to the front of the furnace. The thousands of tongues of fire at the furnace opening retreated again and again, frightened by the enthusiasm of the heroes.

    The east turned white, and good news came with the morning light: the first furnace of steel in the high-yield battle, the smelting time was seven hours and forty-six minutes, breaking the eight o'clock barrier, the hourly output was sixteen tons, creating the latest record....

    People listened excitedly to this first song of triumph.

    Pursuit

    For the second shift, two hours before the start of the shift, Cheng Dinglong, the smelting shift leader of the No. 3 open hearth furnace, hurried onto the platform.

    "Hey, Old Cheng!" As soon as Cheng Dinglong got on the platform, he met Zhou Wenhui, the Party branch secretary of the second shift. Secretary Zhou asked, "It's still early for work, what are you doing here?"

    "Can't sleep!" Cheng Dinglong originally wanted to ask Secretary Zhou why he came so early, but what he said was: "How was the previous shift?"

    "Their carbon and sulfur are almost there, they are going to break eight o'clock!"

    "Good, we will never lag behind!"

    "Yes, we must catch up with them!" Secretary Zhou and Cheng Dinglong discussed measures for a while, and said before leaving: "You are the red flag shift for two consecutive weeks in the August general battle, you can't lag behind!"

    "Lag behind? Don't worry, Secretary!"

    This young man had such a drive, doing what he said. As soon as he started work, he first focused on charging.

    "To surpass the first shift, are there any problems?" Cheng Dinglong asked the charging driver.

    "Only shorter, not longer!" The driver raised his head and, with a "whoosh," hooked the charging hopper and rushed towards the fiery furnace door.

    The branch secretary, the smelting shift leader, and the molten iron dispatcher all rushed to the molten iron trough at the back of the furnace. They raced against time with the workers and finally tapped eight ladles of molten iron, setting a new record of twelve minutes ahead of the original plan.

    "Dang, dang, dang, dang!" The steel tapping bell rang.

    The propagandist turned over the merit book and asked: "How long?"

    "Seven hours and fifty-three minutes!"

    "Didn't catch up with the first shift, they were seven hours and forty-six minutes!"

    "Who said we didn't catch up, our furnace output is high, the hourly output is twenty tons, exceeding them by 20%!"

    "Ah!" The propagandist made a big stroke on the book and raised his thumb: "Good job, you did what you said!"…

    How much is tapped in front of the furnace, how much is poured behind the furnace!

    Encouraged by the call of "Shine Brightly on August 15th," whether it was in front of or behind the furnace, or in the gas furnace or the iron melting furnace, everyone was of one mind, everyone was of one mind, and they were all heading towards one goal: to achieve high production and high quality, and to respond to the call for increased production and thrift with practical actions! – Thus, the coordination and cooperation between various types of work became closer, and communist collaboration was further strengthened.

    As soon as Zhong Shishun, the steel pouring shift leader at the back of the furnace, started work, he was excited by the continuous new smelting records from the front of the furnace. He said to the steel pouring assistant: "The front of the furnace has gone up, we can't slow down at the back of the furnace!"

    "Who says it's not!" The assistant completely agreed: "Master Zhong, how do we go up?"

    "First of all, guarantee how much is tapped and how much is poured, aim accurately and calculate accurately, and don't pour 'dwarf steel'!"

    "Yes, we must never let the back of the furnace affect the front of the furnace!"

    As they spoke, the steel tapping bell on the platform rang urgently. Steel was being tapped.

    "Dwarf steel" had not been completely avoided in the steel pouring section for a long time, because the molten steel was not easy to estimate accurately in the ladle. Once poured, there would inevitably be too much or too little. If there was too much, it would overflow, and if there was too little, the steel ingot would become a "dwarf." Zhong Shishun was determined to eliminate "dwarfs."

    He calmly blocked his face with his arms, observed the molten steel, and finally began to pour.

    The molten steel poured happily into the pouring pipe from the bottom of the ladle. Plate after plate of steel ingots were filled. Zhong Shishun kept observing and calculating until the entire ladle of steel was poured into the last plate. The molten steel obediently poured into the ingot mold along the pouring pipe, and 100% of the entire ladle of steel was poured into finished products, eliminating "dwarf steel."

    Everyone praised Old Zhong. Old Zhong said: "Pouring all the molten steel into good steel ingots, this is our responsibility for ensuring high production at the back of the furnace!"

    Three Stars Shine, Hall is Red

    The task of the third shift of the No. 3 furnace was: to seize time, fight for every second, seize the last furnace of steel, and achieve "Shine Brightly" for the whole day's production.

    The new records of breaking eight o'clock by two furnaces of steel in two consecutive shifts created a good situation for the production of the third shift. Before starting work, all the workers in the shift put on their protective clothing, carried their shovels, and held a pre-shift oath-taking ceremony with full confidence in victory. Their determination was: "Catch up with the first shift, surpass the second shift, and we will not be satisfied if we don't win three furnaces!"

    A fierce battle to attack sulfur, seize high production, and strive for the final victory unfolded under the platform. All the conditions were good, except for one thing: the sulfur content was high after melting, and the time was already 8:55 p.m., which meant that within the only three hours left in the whole day, it was necessary to attack the high sulfur – this task was extremely difficult, and it was also an important key to seizing high production for the whole day.

    "Everyone, tell me, can this furnace of steel be taken down today?" Tan Jun, the duty director, asked everyone to express their opinions at the furnace-side meeting.

    "This furnace of steel is the key to high production," said Feng Shuliang, the smelting shift leader, standing up. "How can we achieve high production if we don't take it down?"

    "The sulfur is so high, what do we do?"
    "..."

    The hands of the electric clock moved forward mercilessly, and people's hearts beat even more violently....

    Suddenly, a burst of "clanging" gongs and drums rang to the platform. The propagandist raised a large red sign with several lines of large characters written on it: The company Party committee issued an emergency call, the No. 3 open hearth furnace must produce three furnaces of steel today to achieve "Three Stars Shine, Hall is Red."

    The propagandist picked up the loudspeaker and shouted: "Comrades, the Party secretary called to urge us to speed up the attack on sulfur and be sure to grab this furnace of steel!"

    "Be sure to grab this furnace of steel!" The Party's call gave the steel-grabbing heroes great encouragement, like a raging fire rising in the stove, and a pot of boiling water boiled up.

    "Immediately add lime to make slag and desulfurize!"
    "Prepare raw materials!"
    "Increase the temperature!" "Skim the slag!" …

    The intense sulfur-attacking battle unfolded fully on the platform. Everyone had only one thought in mind: immediately attack the sulfur and tap the steel within 24:00.

    The electric clock on the wall was moving, and finally only half an hour was left. The record board recorded the sulfur in the furnace: two hundred, one hundred and thirty, one hundred and twenty-eight, one hundred and twenty-two, and one hundred and twenty-two more had to be attacked!

    People often say: "Seizing steel is not about a few pounds, but not letting go of a second," at this time, how precious even half a second seemed!

    "Burn the tamper!" In order to seize the time to attack sulfur and observe the temperature, the duty director ordered the burning tamper to measure the temperature.

    A young man responded and inserted a thick steel bar into the furnace, standing straight in the raging flames. In order to seize the time, the high temperature had long been thrown out of the sky by this young man.

    Another chemical analysis report came: there were only one hundred and twenty sulfurs left!

    The electric clock on the wall pointed: only ten minutes were left!

    The situation became more and more urgent. The Party secretary, the factory director, and leaders at all levels all came to the front of the furnace. Suddenly, the dispatch room sent out a message: "The municipal Party committee called to ask whether this furnace of steel can be produced. If it can be produced, the city will be able to break three thousand tons."

    "Report to the municipal Party committee," everyone on the platform answered in unison:

    "We must take down this furnace of steel even if there is only one minute left!"

    "Report, the sulfur has been reduced to one hundred and eighteen, and the current time is: 23:54!"

    "Prepare ferromanganese!" The duty director turned and greeted the feeder, in fact, the feeder had already hooked up more than one ton of ferromanganese needed for steel tapping and was waiting.

    Then came the last tamper burning, and there was no problem with the temperature. The remaining ten or so sulfurs could be completely dealt with outside the furnace. So, with a command:

    "Tap the steel!"

    With a "thump," an assistant, Luo Bocheng, opened the tap hole with a new record of one minute, and the back of the steelmaking furnace suddenly rose with ten thousand zhang of golden light!

    "Three Stars Shine" was successfully realized! The complete red victory was successfully realized! Shine Brightly was successfully realized!

    "Three Stars Shine" rose an unsetting sun. The workers of the No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of Chonggang, since August 15th, have been making continuous efforts to maintain high production. From August 16th to 22nd, the average daily output for the seven days increased by 28.5% compared with the average daily output for the previous seven days, and the quality also exceeded the national standards every day.

    Victory has added new strength to the people; victory is attracting people to continue to stride forward! (Attached picture)

    三星高照满堂红
    ——记重庆钢铁公司平炉二厂增产节约竞赛第一仗
    重钢党委写作组
    “八月十五，大放光明！”——这是中共四川省委和重庆市委向钢铁职工提出来的响亮号召。省、市委要求钢铁工人们要从8月15日这天开始，以优质高产的新成绩来投入以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动。这个号召犹如狂风掀巨澜，在重庆钢铁公司每个炼钢工人的心里鼓起了滚滚浪涛。炼钢工人的心沸腾了！重钢，到处是一片激动的情绪、坚定的信心和顽强的干劲合卷着的滔滔热浪！……
    凭着党的号召的巨大鼓舞力量，凭着炼钢工人远胜烈火的雄心，这一天，重庆钢铁公司钢的日产量大大超过了7、8月以来的平均日产水平；而三号平炉，更以日产三炉钢、产量比8月份1至14日平均日产猛增75.48％的优异成绩超额完成了国家计划，取得了满堂红的胜利。
    第一曲凯歌
    8月14日，夜，钢城万盏灯火，半边天一片通红，在平炉炼钢二厂学习室里，一大班党支部书记张庆祥同志正在作“大放光明”的动员报告：
    “……15日实现高产优质，就是我们响应党的增产节约号召的实际表现。我们班是15日生产的第一班，能否打响头一炮，任务在我们肩头上。最近冶炼时间平均每炉在十一个小时以上，但是，我们必须千方百计，攻下八点……”
    书记的话还没落音，三号平炉冶炼班长曾云仿便敲响了铜锣般的声音：“八点？我们保证在八点以内！”
    “好呀！”张庆祥往众人扫了一眼：“大家看……”
    “保证原材料源源不断！”
    “保证炉后不影响炉前！”
    “保证煤气充分供应！”
        “……”
    是啊！自从党发出了开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动号召以后，炼钢工人的激情早就按捺不住了，书记号召冶炼时间破八点，夺取高产优质，大家又怎不争先恐后，赴以全力呢？很快，会场的热烈情绪便传到了炼钢平台。
    一上班，炉后便开始兑铁水。曾云仿清楚地知道这道工序对缩短冶炼时间的关键作用。他匆匆地往炉后转去。
    铁水槽，此刻溅起了万点火星，千度高温逼得人休想贴近。
    “铁水够不够呀？”冶炼班长仰首往顶头打招呼。
    “够了，马上便要兑完了！”一个熟悉的声音从头上传下来。
    “噫！张书记在表演吗？”老曾忙问。
    “哈哈，试一试呀”。
    “张书记这一个‘双车兑铁水’，保险缩短一半时间！”铁水调度员蔡世华在上头接着说。
    正说着，上头传来：“兑完！”
    下头马上报告：“全长十八分钟！”
    “新记录啊！”铁水调度员在上头兴奋地喊叫起来。
    “六十分钟缩短到十八分”。老曾喜滋滋地扳起指头一算，“呀，缩短这么多，从来没有的啊！”
    冶炼班长飞快转向炉前，和同志们一起抓紧操作。那熊熊的炉火，对英雄们来说，不是畏惧，而是高兴，因为火越大，温度越高，炼钢便越快。
    “第一个钢样来了！”化验工飞报说。
    “碳份多少？”冶炼班长问。
    “1.32％！”
    “1.32％？！”曾云仿暗吃一惊，合格钢含碳份不能超过0.22％，显然，降碳的困难很大。
    “八小时降低碳份都不够！”有人对攻下八点关失掉了信心。
    “这样不行！”曾云仿（他又是党小组长）马上在炉边召开了党小组会。
    “首先得统一思想，坚定信心！”“我们要带头采取紧急行动！”……
    党员们分别发表着意见，最后决定：分头向大家讲有利条件，鼓舞群众干劲；技术上立即加矿石、石灰，紧急降碳。
    思想统一了。矿石、石灰进炉后，立即开始放渣。曾云仿挥动扒子，一步越拢炉门，带头战胜高温，搅拌扒渣，加速渣子流速。工会主席胡炳全和班上其他同志也向炉前扑来，那炉口的千条火舌，在英雄们的干劲面前，吓得连连后退。
    东方发白了，好消息乘着晨曦传来：高产战斗第一炉钢，冶炼时间七点四十六分，突破了八点关，小时产量十六吨，创造了最新记录……。
    人们兴奋地听着这第一曲凯歌。
    追
    第二班，离上班时间还差两个小时，三号平炉冶炼班长程定龙便匆匆忙忙地走上平台。
    “嘿，老程！”程定龙才上平台，就碰见了二班党支部书记周文辉。周书记问：“上班还早嘛，跑来干啥？”
    “睡不着！”程定龙本想反问周书记为啥来得这么早，但他出口的却是：“上一班怎么样？”
    “人家碳、硫都差不多了，要破八点啊！”
    “好，我们决不落后！”
    “对，要赶过他们！”周书记和程定龙扯了一阵子措施，临走说：“你们是8月大会战连续两周的红旗班，不能落后啊！”
    “落后？书记放心！”
    这小伙子就有这么股劲头，说干就干。一上班，他首先抓进料。
    “要超过一班，有问题没有？”程定龙问进料司机。
    “只短不长！”司机脑壳一扬，“呼”地一声便衔起料斗，往火舌翻飞的炉门冲去。
    支部书记、冶炼班长、铁水调度员，一齐涌向炉后铁水槽。他们和工人一起争分夺秒，最后以比原订计划提前十二分钟的新成绩，兑完八包铁水。
    “当、当、当、当！”出钢钟响了。
    宣传员翻起记功簿问：“好长时间？”
    “七点五十三分！”
    “没赶上一班罗，人家是七点四十六分呀！”
    “谁说没赶上，咱们炉产量高，小时产量二十吨，超过他们20％呀！”
    “啊！”宣传员往簿子上大挥两笔后，翘起大指头：“好样的，说到做到！”……
    炉前出多少，炉后浇多少！
    在“八月十五大放光明”的号召的鼓舞下，不管是炉前、炉后，也不管是煤气炉、化铁炉，人人一条心，个个一股劲，共同奔向一个目标：实现高产优质，以实际行动响应增产节约号召！——于是，各工种联系配合更加紧密了，共产主义协作更加加强了。
    炉后浇钢班长钟世顺，一上班便被炉前连续传来的冶炼新记录激动了。他对浇钢助手说：“炉前上去了，我们炉后不能慢步呀！”
    “谁说不是！”助手完全同意：“钟师傅，我们如何上呢？”
    “首先保证出多少浇多少，看准算准，不浇‘矮子钢’！”
    “对，决不因炉后跟不上影响炉前！”
    说着，平台上出钢钟急促地敲打起来。出钢了。
    “矮子钢”，在浇钢工段长时间没完全避免，因为钢水在包子内不易估计准，一浇，便难免有多有少，多则漫溢，少则钢锭便成“矮子”。钟世顺决心要消灭“矮子”。
    他泰然地用臂膀挡住脸膛，察看钢水，最后开始浇注。
    钢水从钢包底欢快地注进浇管，一板板钢锭浇满了，钟世顺不断地观察不断地计算，一直到整包钢水浇到最后一板。钢水乖乖地顺着浇管注进钢锭模，整包钢水百分之百地浇成了成品，消灭了“矮子钢”。
    大家称赞老钟。老钟却说：“把钢水全部浇成好钢锭，这就是我们炉后保高产的责任！”
    三星高照满堂红
    三号炉第三班的任务是：抢时间，争分秒，抓最后一炉钢，实现全天生产“大放光明”。
    连续两班两炉钢突破八点的新记录，为第三班的生产创造了良好形势。全班工人在上班前就穿上劳保服，扛上洋锹，满怀胜利信心地举行了班前大誓师，他们的决心是：“赶一班，超二班，不夺三炉心不甘！”
    一场激烈的攻硫磺、夺高产、争取最后胜利的大会战在平台下展开了。一切条件良好，只是一条：熔化后含硫率高，而时间已经是夜晚二十点五十五分，即是说，在全天仅剩下的三个小时内，要攻下高硫，——这个任务是极其艰巨的，而这又是夺取全天高产的一个重要关键。
    “大家说这炉钢今天拿不拿得下来？”值班主任谭均在炉边会上让大家发表意见。
    “这炉钢是高产的关键”冶炼班长冯树良站起来说：“不拿下来怎么实现高产？”
    “硫磺这么高，如何办？”
    “……”
    电挂钟的指针毫不留情地迈开步子往前走，人们的心，跳得更厉害了……。
    突然，一阵“铿锵铿锵的锣鼓声，敲至平台，宣传员抬来一块大红牌子，上写几行大字：公司党委发出紧急号召，三号平炉今天一定要出三炉钢，实现“三星高照满堂红”。
    宣传员端起大喇叭喊道：“同志们，党委书记打来电话，号召我们加紧攻硫磺，一定要把这炉钢抓出来！”
    “一定要把这炉钢抓出来！”党的号召给了夺钢英雄巨大的鼓舞，好像灶内升烈火，一锅开水翻腾起来了。
   “马上加石灰造渣脱硫！”
   “原料准备！”
   “升温！”“扒渣！”……
    紧张的攻硫战斗在平台上全面铺开，大家心头只有一个想法：立即把硫磺攻下来，在二十四点以内出钢。
    墙上的电钟在移动着，最后只剩半小时了。记录板上记着炉内的硫磺：二百个、一百三十个、一百二十八个、一百二十二个，还得攻下一百二十二个！
    人们常说：“夺钢铁斤两不少，抢时间分秒不让”，在这种时候，那怕是半分半秒钟，都显得多么宝贵啊！
    “烧捣棒！”值班主任为了抓紧攻硫的时间观察温度，命令烧捣棒测温。
    一个小伙子应声而上，“卡”地一声将一根粗大的钢条插进炉膛，直登登地挺立在熊熊烈焰之中。为了抢时间，高温，早被这年轻人抛向九霄云外。
    又一个化验报告传来：硫磺只剩下一百二十个了！
    墙上的电钟指着：时间，只剩下十分钟了！
    情况越来越紧急，党委书记、厂长和各级领导干部，全都来到炉前。忽然，调度室传出话来：“市委来电话，问这炉钢出不出得来，能出，全市就能突破三千吨。”
    “向市委报告”，平台上众人一齐答应着：
    “就剩一分钟也要拿下这炉钢！”
    “报告，硫磺降低到一百一十八个，现在的时间是：二十三点五十四分！”
    “准备锰铁！”值班主任转身招呼进料机，其实，进料机此刻早已把出钢需用的一吨多锰铁衔起来等候了。
    接着是烧最后一次捣棒，温度没有问题。剩下的十来个硫磺，完全可以在炉外处理。于是，一声令下：
    “出钢！”
    “通”地一声，一助手罗伯成以一分钟的最新纪录通开了出钢口，炼钢炉后，顿时腾起了万丈金光！
    “三星高照”胜利实现了！满堂红胜利实现了！大放光明胜利实现了！
    “三星高照”，升起了不落的太阳。重钢平炉二厂的职工，自8月15日以后，更是一鼓作气，持续高产。8月16日到22日七天以来的平均日产量比前七天的平均日产量又增长了28.5％，质量也天天超额完成国家规定的指标。
    胜利，给人们增添了新的力量；胜利，招引着人们继续大踏步向前！（附图片）
    “一定要把这炉钢抓出来！”
