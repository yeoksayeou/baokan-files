    Mao Zedong, the sun of all ethnic groups!
    Ever since your sunlight illuminated Xishuangbanna,
    I have stood by the Lancang River,
    Singing, facing your radiance.
    Although poems praising you,
    Have filled my bamboo house to the brim,
    But your kindness to the Dai people,
    I can never, ever finish singing.

    Mao Zedong! The sun of all ethnic groups!
    Ever since I shook your hand and took a photo with you in Zhongnanhai the year before last,
    I have been greeting the morning glow and wearing the moonlight every day,
    Singing of you from the bottom of my heart.
    Whenever I encounter difficulties in my work,
    Your sunlight shines on my bamboo window,
    Giving me strength all over my body.
    In the past two years, I have used these hands that shook yours,
    To build a dam on the construction site,
    Blocking the raging floods;
    In the vast forest,
    I used these hands to smelt the first furnace of steel.

    Now I bring the blessings of the Dai people,
    To your side again to shake your hand and take a photo,
    My broad heart,
    Seems to hold an ocean of joy!
    Soon I will take the wisdom and strength you gave me,
    Back to the remote border region,
    I will use my hands,
    To pick pieces of white clouds as paper,
    In the night when the stars light my lamp,
    I will use my hands to hold up the Lancang River water,
    Turning every drop of crystal water,
    Into lines of poetry to thank you;
    Every morning when the sun rises,
    I will entrust the rainbow clouds
    To bring the song from the south to the north...

    托彩霞　寄歌声
    傣族歌手　康朗甩
    毛主席啊，各族人民的太阳！
    自从您的阳光把西双版纳照亮，
    我就站在澜沧江边，
    迎着您的光芒歌唱。
    虽然歌颂您的诗篇，
    已把我的竹楼堆满，
    但您对傣家的恩情，
    我却永生永世也唱不完。
    毛主席啊！各族人民的太阳！
    自从前年我在中南海和您握手照像，
    我每天迎着朝霞披着月光，
    从心底把您歌唱。
    每当我在工作中遇到困难，
    您的阳光就照亮我的竹窗，
    使我浑身上下有力量。
    两年来我用这双握过您的手，
    在工地上建筑起水坝，
    把汹涌的洪水阻拦；
    在茫茫的森林里，
    我用这双手炼过第一炉钢。
    如今我又带着傣族人民的祝福，
    来到您的身边和您握手照像，
    我宽阔的心啊，
    仿佛像装得下一个欢乐的海洋！
    不久我将带着您赠给我的智慧和力量，
    回到遥远的边疆，
    我将用双手，
    摘下片片白云作纸张，
    在星星为我掌灯的夜晚，
    我将用双手捧起澜沧江水，
    把每一滴晶莹的水珠，
    化作感谢您的诗行；
    每当太阳升起的早上，
    我将托彩霞
    把歌声从南方带到北方……
