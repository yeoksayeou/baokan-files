Ore Dressing Ascends the Mountain, Crushing Ascends the Mountain, Roasting Ascends the Mountain
Zhang Zhong, First Secretary of the CPC Jiaozuo Municipal Committee, Henan Province

    In the past two years, the steel industry in our city has continuously developed. As the level of smelting technology has improved, the throughput of small iron-smelting blast furnaces has increased, requiring the supply of more ore. In the process of accelerating the development of the mining industry, we have adopted the method of "Three Ascents to the Mountain," namely: ore dressing ascends the mountain; ore dressing is done on-site; crushing ascends the mountain; crushing is done on-site; roasting ascends the mountain; roasting is done on-site. Practice has proven that this method has many benefits.
    "Three Ascents to the Mountain" can fully utilize iron ore resources and turn lean ore into rich ore. In the first half of this year, 40% of the ore mined in our city could not be transported down the mountain due to its low grade, due to natural conditions. After implementing on-site ore dressing, on-site crushing, and on-site roasting in the mines, the iron content of the ore has been greatly improved. In particular, the ore in Jiaozuo is limonite, which contains a large amount of water. Roasting can reduce the moisture content, which is conducive to increasing the blast furnace temperature. As a result of promoting "Three Ascents to the Mountain," the city's output of rich ore has increased from 32% of the total output to 68%.
    "Three Ascents to the Mountain" can greatly reduce the amount of transportation. In the past, because crushing was done inside the steel mills, ore fines and impurities accounted for 30% of the ore transported down from the mountain, which was a waste of transportation capacity. At the same time, because on-site crushing and roasting were not done on the mountain, the ore had to be collected from the mining points and transported to the crushing workshops of various steel mills, then transported to the roasting workshops after crushing, and then transported to the blast furnace workshops after roasting, which wasted a lot of in-plant transportation capacity. After implementing "Three Ascents to the Mountain," not only has the transportation capacity for unnecessary ore fines and impurities been saved, but also the ore can be transported directly to the blast furnace in one trip from the mountain, reducing in-plant transportation. In addition, the ore production time has also been shortened, and the ore fines accumulated in the steel mills themselves during crushing have also disappeared.
    "Three Ascents to the Mountain" can also fully utilize the capacity of crushing and roasting equipment. In the past, each steel mill had ore dressing, roasting, and crushing workshops. After implementing "Three Ascents to the Mountain," the scattered manpower and material resources have been concentrated, giving full play to the superiority of being organized, which can fully tap the potential of the equipment; and large-scale production is also conducive to improving technology and quality.
    After the ore dressing, crushing, and roasting work is led by the mine, the leading cadres of various steel mills can concentrate their efforts on grasping blast furnace production and improving the output and quality of steel and iron.
    In the process of implementing "Three Ascents to the Mountain," we mobilized the mine workers to rely on their own efforts based on the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and solved many equipment problems through substitution, manufacturing, piecing together, and modification, established roasting furnaces, and installed crushers. We also organized various parties to support this work. Leading cadres and technicians from various relevant departments went to the mountains one after another to contribute to the "Three Ascents to the Mountain." The power department went to the mountains to erect lines; the machinery factory produced various equipment such as crushers and roasters, and undertook the machine installation tasks; the coal mine actively produced lump coal to support roasting; the transportation department engaged in two-way transportation, hauling ore downhill and hauling coal uphill; those engaged in testing went to the mountains to test, and those engaged in exploration and design went to the mountains to pave the way. This ensured that the work of "Three Ascents to the Mountain" was carried out in a more, faster, better, and more economical manner.
    "Three Ascents to the Mountain" is a powerful guarantee for the continued large-scale growth of steel. With the realization of "Three Ascents to the Mountain," the steel production in our city of Jiaozuo will continue to leap forward even better.

    选矿上山　粉碎上山　焙烧上山
    中共河南省焦作市委第一书记　张重
    两年来，我市钢铁工业不断发展。冶炼技术水平提高以后，炼铁小高炉吞吐量增大，要求供应更多的矿石。在加速发展采掘工业的过程中，我们采取了“三上山”的办法，即：选矿上山；就地选矿；破碎上山，就地破碎；焙烧上山，就地焙烧。实践证明，这一办法有许多好处。
    “三上山”能够充分利用铁矿资源，把贫矿变成富矿。今年上半年，我市开采的矿石因为自然条件的关系，有40％因品位不高而不能下山。实行在矿山就地选矿、就地破碎、就地焙烧以后，矿石含铁品位大大提高。特别是焦作的矿石系褐铁矿，含水分较大，经过焙烧可以减少水分，有利于提高高炉炉温。推行“三上山”的结果，全市富矿产量由原来占总产量的32％，提高到了68％。
    “三上山”可以大大减少运输量。过去由于在钢铁厂内破碎，从山上运下的矿石，矿粉和杂质占了运输量的30％，这对运输力量是个浪费。同时，由于不在山上就地破碎、焙烧，就必须由矿点把矿石集中起来，分别运送到各个钢铁厂的粉碎车间，破碎以后又运到焙烧车间，焙烧之后再送到高炉车间，这样又浪费了大量的厂内运输力量。实行“三上山”以后，不但节省了不必要的运矿粉、杂质的运输力量，而且从山上起运一次就可以直达高炉旁边，减少了厂内运输。此外，矿石生产时间也缩短了，钢铁厂里自己破碎时积存的矿粉也不见了。
    “三上山”还能充分发挥粉碎、焙烧设备的能力。过去每个钢铁厂都有选矿、焙烧、粉碎车间。实行“三上山”以后，把分散的人力、物力集中起来，发挥了组织起来的优越性，能够充分发挥设备潜力；而且大规模生产，也便于提高技术，提高质量。
    选矿、粉碎、焙烧工作由矿山领导以后，各个钢铁厂的领导干部更能集中精力，狠抓高炉生产提高钢、铁的产量和质量。
    在实行“三上山”的过程中，我们发动矿山职工根据土洋并举的原则，自力更生，以代用、制造、拼凑、改装的办法，解决了许多设备方面的问题，建立了焙烧炉，安装了破碎机。我们还组织各方面支援这一工作。各有关部门的领导干部和技术人员纷纷上山，为“三上山”贡献力量。电力部门上山架线；机械厂生产粉碎、焙烧等各种设备，担负机器安装任务；煤矿积极生产块煤，支援焙烧，运输部门搞双程运输，下山时拉矿石，上山时拉煤炭；搞化验的上山化验，搞勘探设计的上山作开路先行。这样便保证了“三上山”的工作进行得又多又快又好又省。
    “三上山”是钢铁继续大幅度增长的一项有力保证。随着“三上山”的实现，我们焦作市的钢铁生产将会更好地持续跃进。
