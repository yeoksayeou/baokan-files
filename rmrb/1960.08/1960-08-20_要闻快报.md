	News in Brief
	Production Exceeded Daily in Competitions
	Coal mine workers in Handan, Hebei Province, launched a competition to "increase production by 0.25 tons of coal per person per day." Since July, more than 11,400 workers in the city have achieved daily overproduction of 0.25 tons of coal. The city's daily raw coal output in July increased by 8% compared to June, and there has been further growth since August.

	Competition for More Hauls and Faster Runs
	Workers on the transportation front in Shaanxi Province are conducting a large-scale "Wan, Qian, San" competition (freight trucks producing 10,000 ton-kilometers per month, horse-drawn carts producing 1,000 ton-kilometers per month, handcarts producing 300 ton-kilometers per month) to ensure better completion of key material transportation tasks. Freight trucks throughout the province have already met the target of producing 10,000 ton-kilometers per month for four consecutive months.

	Coal Transportation Plans Exceeded Daily
	The Liuzhou Railway Bureau vigorously promotes the "dragon network" of transportation, strengthens collaboration between railways and mines, and conducts technological revolution in loading and unloading, making the "more transport, ensure high yield" competition vigorous and down-to-earth. Since May, the bureau has overfulfilled its coal transportation plan for three consecutive months, and in early August, it achieved over fulfillment of more than 20% every day.

	Grasping Ore Transportation Firmly
	The Qijiang Iron Mine in Sichuan Province firmly grasps the work of ore transportation. The Party committee supervises transportation four times a day, regularly checks the implementation of the transportation plan, and promptly solves problems when they are discovered. The Party committee also led the workers to carry out technical transformations in the short-distance transportation from the mine to the foot of the mountain and the loading of trains at the railway station. From August 1st to 12th, the amount of ore transported down the mountain increased by about 40% compared to the same period in July, and the amount of ore transported out by train increased significantly.
