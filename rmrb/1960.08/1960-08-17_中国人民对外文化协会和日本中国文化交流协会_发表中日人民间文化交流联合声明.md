Xinhua News Agency, 16th. Joint Statement on People-to-People Cultural Exchange between China and Japan issued by China People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association.

At the invitation of the China People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Kenzo Nakajima, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, visited the People's Republic of China at the end of July 1960 and held cordial talks with Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the China People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, on the issue of cultural exchanges between the people of China and Japan, reaching a complete consensus.

Since the "Joint Statement on People-to-People Cultural Exchange between China and Japan" was signed between the two sides in June 1959, cultural exchanges between the two peoples have developed satisfactorily, making significant contributions to the development of friendship between the two peoples and the enrichment of the cultures of the two countries. The Chinese people are overjoyed and encouraged by the great victories won by the Japanese people in their struggle to abolish the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and eliminate U.S. military bases, and to strive for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality, and will continue to give firm support. In the future, in order to further develop cultural exchanges between the two peoples, both sides will, in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference, continue to wage unremitting struggles to eliminate all forces that pursue a policy of hostility towards China, create the "two Chinas" plot, and hinder the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan.

Both sides believe that further strengthening cultural exchanges between the people of China and Japan is in line with the aspirations of the people of both countries for friendship and unity and is conducive to the development of the cultural undertakings of both countries. The China People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, based on the above common belief, unanimously agree to work together to realize the following cultural exchanges and friendly exchanges:

	1.	The China People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and relevant Chinese cultural organizations will invite Japanese academic delegations, Japanese writer delegations, Japanese film and playwright delegations, Japanese cartoonist delegations, Japanese artist delegations, Japanese calligrapher delegations, Japanese young cultural activist delegations, Japanese photographer delegations, and individual cultural figures to visit China;
	2.	The China People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries will invite Japanese choirs to perform in China;
