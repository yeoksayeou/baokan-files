    She Did Ordinary Yet Great Work
    ——Remembering Ji A’qiao, Team Leader of a Housekeeping Service Group in Shanghai
    By our reporters Gao Jie and He Qilie
    Chairman Mao once taught us in an article “In Memory of Norman Bethune” that we must have “the spirit of absolute selflessness.” He said, "A man's ability may be great or small, but if he has this spirit, he is already noble-minded and pure, a man of moral integrity and above vulgar interests, a man who is of value to the people." Among the broad masses building socialism today, there are thousands upon thousands of such people. Ji A’qiao, the team leader of the housekeeping service group of the Jiangpu Road Third Neighborhood Committee in Yangpu District, Shanghai, is one of these people. For more than a year, she has led more than twenty ordinary housewives in doing nothing more than trivial housework such as emptying chamber pots, washing clothes, mopping floors, taking care of new mothers and patients, carrying water, or temporarily looking after children. However, they have helped more than one hundred families of male and female workers devote their full attention to production, instead of being preoccupied with household chores. They have helped more than ten small factory youth single workers with washing and sewing, removing "worries about the home front.” They regard serving other people's families as contributing to the cause of socialism. Under the influence of Ji A’qiao, neighborhood committees in many districts of the city have successively established housekeeping service groups. "Learn from Ji A'qiao, catch up with Ji A'qiao!" has become the slogan of action for more than 6,000 neighborhood service organizations in Shanghai. Ji A’qiao has become a bright red banner for housewives in Shanghai neighborhoods. Because she has done everything possible for production, wholeheartedly served the workers, continuously made revolution, and worked selflessly, she was honorably approved to join the Communist Party in June of this year.
    Ji A’qiao is forty-seven years old this year. Her husband, Xu Changqing, is an old maintenance worker and a Communist Party member at the Shanghai Knitting Factory. Like many working women, Ji A’qiao started working at the age of nine, and later became unemployed, begging and picking up trash, doing everything. After getting married, she and her husband worked themselves to the bone, but in the end, they couldn't even support their own children; six of their ten children died. After liberation, life improved, and the children all went to school. She always thought, "All this is thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party. No matter what, I must keep the Party in my heart and do my part for socialism."
    The wave of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 also mobilized the housewives here. Among the 1,039 households in the Xinglong Street area where she lived, there were originally 439 female workers, and more than 200 women joined the workforce after the Great Leap Forward. At this time, the neighborhood cadres were also preparing to introduce Ji A'qiao to a yarn tube factory to work. She was extremely happy. She thought, "Chairman Mao is so wise, how did he see my heart's desire?" But at this moment, the neighborhood committee wanted to establish a housekeeping service group to help some workers' families who had no one to take care of their housework, such as emptying chamber pots and washing clothes. At the mobilization meeting, no one was willing to participate at first. Some said, "Liberating women, after all this liberation, we're still doing housework, who wants to do it?" Others disliked the work of emptying chamber pots as being dirty and smelly. Ji A'qiao saw it all and kept it in her heart. She thought that since the Great Leap Forward, although collective canteens and nurseries had been established in the neighborhood, and the problems of eating and children had been solved, emptying chamber pots, mopping floors, and sewing still took up a lot of the workers' time and energy. Many female workers had to empty their chamber pots before going to work in the morning; sometimes the manure truck was late, and they would be late for work, and being late would affect production. Thinking of this, Ji A'qiao stood up on the spot, "I'm not afraid of getting dirty, I'm signing up to join the service group!"
    At first, she worked alone, taking on all the dirty and heavy work. Every morning, she would get up at four or five o'clock, gently carry other people's chamber pots out, pour them into the manure truck, and wash them clean. The clothes she washed were not only washed well and folded neatly, but she also mended all the holes and sewed on any missing buttons. More and more things needed her to do, and she couldn't do it alone no matter what, so she actively went to persuade others to join her. First there were five, then ten, and finally twenty-one housewives joined the housekeeping service group. Their service recipients also gradually expanded to more than one hundred households, and they were increasingly praised by the workers. If a worker's family member became ill, the child was weaned, or there was a wedding or funeral in the family, they would ask the service group for help.
    Ji A'qiao was not satisfied with these achievements. Whenever she had free time, she would look for things to do everywhere and proactively offer her services. One afternoon, just as the Xin Tong Machine Factory near the neighborhood was letting out work, Ji A'qiao saw many workers, especially young workers, whose clothes had missing buttons or were torn and not mended. She thought that if the workers' clothes were torn, small holes would become big holes, which would not only waste clothes, but also cause accidents in production if the torn clothes caught on the machine. Fearing that the workers would be embarrassed to ask her to sew for free, she posted a notice at the factory gate: Those who want to wash clothes can contact the nearby Xinglong Street Laundry Group, and all sizes of holes, replacements, and buttons will be sewn on for free. From then on, Ji A'qiao would go to the gates of more than ten nearby factories three times a day, morning, noon, and evening, to pick up and deliver clothes. She would carry a bundle of washed clothes in one hand and a sewing basket in the other, and if she saw that a worker's clothes were torn or missing a button, she would sew it up or sew it on the spot. The young workers all affectionately called her "Mama Ji."
    The service group led by Ji A'qiao really took care of everything. Everyone in the neighborhood called them "the all-in-one managers." In addition to emptying chamber pots, washing clothes, and sewing, they also knitted sweaters, sewed soles, and helped with shopping; when it rained, they rushed to deliver umbrellas and galoshes to the workers; they almost always responded to requests. Ji A'qiao said, "If we manage these things well, the workers can devote all their attention to production." One winter night, a strong wind was blowing outside when Wang A'di, a female worker at Shenxin No. 5 Factory, suddenly had a miscarriage. Ji A'qiao immediately got out of her warm bed, put on her clothes, and ran to Wang A'di's house, serving her until she was sent to the hospital, and it was already dawn. She thought that Wang A'di's husband had to go to work during the day, and the four children were at home with no one to take care of them. So she helped the children cook and wash clothes during the day, and took the youngest child to sleep at her own house at night. Wang A'di was moved to tears and wanted to thank her, but she said, "What is there to thank? Wasn't I liberated by the Communist Party! If you want to thank someone, thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party!"
    In May of this year, the weather gradually became hot. Mama Ji saw that many female workers and working women in the neighborhood were working hard all day, covered in oil stains and sweat, but there was no women's bathhouse nearby. Going to a bathhouse far away would take more than an hour to go back and forth, and it would cost several dimes, which the sisters found very inconvenient. Ji A'qiao felt that this was also the responsibility of the service group, and that a women's bathhouse had to be built, no matter how difficult it was. At first, when she discussed it with the neighborhood cadres, some people said, "There's no house, no water tank, where will a big stove come from? There's nothing, how can it be done?" Ji A'qiao was not discouraged by this. She said, "We don't have anything now, but everyone can think of a way."
    Soon, with the active support of the district Party branch, Ji A'qiao and the team members used discarded oil drums to make a stove, converted large earthenware water vats into water storage tanks, negotiated with the neighboring school to connect to tap water, found a discarded shower head that someone had set aside, and found two old porcelain washbasins by the roadside in the nearby Labor Park, which they repaired and installed in the bathroom as washbasins. After Ji A'qiao ran around to gather the materials, she combined the service group's two drying rooms into one, and invited enthusiastic workers from the Dongfang Bathhouse to help install the water pipes and faucets. Ji A'qiao stayed close and busy for three whole days, until everything was completed and hot water was released, she finally felt relieved. In this way, a simple women's bathhouse that could accommodate ten people at the same time was born.
    Ji A'qiao's selfless communist spirit of leaving the difficulties to herself and giving the convenience to others, and taking pleasure in helping others, influenced every member of the housekeeping service group. They served conscientiously, and mutual help between neighbors became the norm.
    Ji A'qiao's labor is respected and loved by the people. The residents and workers around her all regard her as a role model, and many workers wrote enthusiastic letters of praise and big-character posters to the neighborhood committee, thanking Ji A'qiao and the service group for their help. A carpenter at the Xintong Machine Factory saw that Ji A'qiao did not have a sewing box, and the needles were wrapped in cloth, which could easily prick her hand, so he made a box and sent it to her, and also painted it with paint, so that she could put needles, thread, and scraps of cloth in it. When the older sisters in the service group were engaged in technical innovation, the workers in nearby factories learned about it and immediately came to support them, helping them to successfully manufacture seven or eight kinds of semi-mechanized equipment such as hand-operated and foot-operated washing machines and spin dryers, making the older sisters' work even more joyful.

    她做了平凡而伟大的工作
    ——记上海一个家务服务组组长姬阿巧的事迹
    本报记者　高洁　何其烈
    毛主席在一篇“纪念白求恩”的文章中，曾经教导我们要具有“毫无自私自利之心的精神”。他说：“一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”在我们今天建设社会主义的广大群众中，有着千千万万个这样的人。上海杨浦区江浦路第三里弄委员会的家务服务组组长姬阿巧就是这种人中间的一个。她领导二十多个普通的家庭妇女，一年多来做的无非是倒马桶，洗衣服，擦地板，服侍产妇、病人，扛水或临时带孩子等等琐碎的家务事，可是她们帮助了一百多个家庭的男女职工把留在家务上的半颗心全部用到了生产上，帮助十多家小厂的青年单身职工洗衣缝补，解除了“后顾之忧”。她们把为别人的家庭服务看做是自己为社会主义事业出了一把力。在姬阿巧的影响下，全市很多区的里弄委员会都纷纷成立了家务服务组。“学姬阿巧，赶姬阿巧！”成了上海六千多个里弄服务组织的行动口号，姬阿巧已成为上海里弄家庭妇女的一面鲜明的红旗。由于她千方百计为生产、全心全意为职工、不断革命、忘我劳动，今年6月光荣地被批准为共产党员。
    姬阿巧今年四十七岁，她的丈夫许长清是上海针织厂的老保全工、共产党员。姬阿巧和很多劳动妇女一样，九岁就开始做工，以后失了业，讨饭、拾垃圾，什么都干过。结婚以后，和丈夫做死做活，可是到头来连自己的孩子都养不活，十个孩子死了六个。解放后，生活变好了，孩子们都上学读书，她一直这么想：“这一切都是靠了共产党领导，不管怎样，我要把党放在心上，一定要为社会主义出一把力。”
    1958年大跃进的浪潮，也带动了这里的家庭妇女。她住的兴隆街一带一千零三十九户人家中，原来就有四百三十九个女职工，大跃进以后又有二百多个妇女走上了生产岗位。这时里弄干部也准备介绍姬阿巧到一家纱管厂去做工。她真是高兴极了。她想：“毛主席真英明，怎么就看出了我的这份心事呢？”可就在这时，里弄委员会要成立家务服务组，帮助一部分无人照顾家务的职工家庭做些倒马桶、洗衣服的事情。动员会上，开始竟没有一个人愿意参加。有的说：“解放妇女，解放了半天还是搞家务，谁愿意干？”有的嫌倒马桶工作又脏又臭。姬阿巧看在眼里，记在心头。她想，大跃进以来，里弄中虽然成立了集体食堂、托儿所，吃饭和孩子的问题解决了，可是倒马桶、擦地板、缝缝补补的事，还要花去职工不少时间和精力。很多女职工早上要倒好马桶才去上班；有时粪车来迟了，上班就要迟到，迟到就会影响生产。想到这里，姬阿巧当场就站起来，“我不怕脏，我报名参加服务组！”
    开始时，她一个人干，不管是什么脏活、重活，全都包下来。她每天早上四五点钟就起身，轻轻地将别人家的马桶拎出来，倒入粪车，洗刷干净。她洗的衣服，不但洗得好，叠得平，还把一个个破洞都给补好，掉了纽扣的给钉上。需要她做的事越来越多了，一个人无论如何干不了，她就积极地去说服别人和她一起做。开始有五个、十个，最后有二十一个家庭妇女参加了家务服务组。她们的服务对象也逐渐扩展到一百多户，而且日益得到职工的好评。有的职工家属生了病，孩子断奶，或是家中有个红白喜事，都要找服务组帮忙。
    姬阿巧不满足于这些成绩，一有空就到处找事做，主动上门服务。一天下午，正逢里弄附近一家新通机器厂放工，姬阿巧看见很多工人，特别是青工，穿的衣服有的掉了纽扣，有的撕破了没有补。她想，工人们衣服破了，小洞变大洞，不仅费衣服，而且破衣服碰上机器，生产上还会出事故。她唯恐工人不好意思要她义务缝补，就在厂门口贴了一张字条：要洗衣服的可向附近兴隆街洗衣组联系，大小洞、换领、钉扣子一律免费。从此，姬阿巧每天早、午、晚三次轮流到附近十多家工厂门口接送衣服。她一手拿着洗好的衣服包袱，一手就拎着个针线筐，看见工人有衣服破了的，或缺了纽扣的，就当场缝好、钉好。青工们都亲热地叫她“姬妈妈。”
    姬阿巧领导的服务组真是无事不管，里弄中都叫她们是“样样管”。她们除了倒马桶、洗衣服、缝缝补补，还代织毛衣、纳鞋底、帮忙买东西；天下雨了，她们忙着给职工送雨伞送套鞋；几乎是有求必应。姬阿巧说：“我们把这些事样样管好，职工们才能把全部心思都用到生产上去”。一个冬天的夜晚，外面刮着大风，申新五厂女工王阿娣突然小产了。姬阿巧得知后立即从热被窝里起来，披上衣服就跑到王阿娣家里，一直服侍到送王阿娣进了医院，已经天亮了。她想到王阿娣丈夫白天要上班，四个孩子在家没有人照管。她就白天帮孩子们烧饭、洗衣服，晚上把最小的孩子带到自己家里睡觉。王阿娣感动得流着眼泪要谢她，可她说：“谢什么，我还不是共产党解放出来的！要谢，你就谢毛主席、谢共产党吧！”
    今年5月，天气渐渐热起来。姬妈妈看见好多女工和里弄劳动妇女辛勤劳动了一天，浑身油污汗水，而附近却没有一家女子浴室。去远地浴室洗个澡，来回要跑上一个多钟点，还得花去好几角钱，姊妹们感到很不方便。姬阿巧认为这也是服务组的责任，有多大困难也得把女子浴室办起来。开始，她和里弄干部商量的时候，有人说：“既无房子，又没有水箱，一只大炉哪里来？样样都没有，怎么办得起来呢？”姬阿巧并不因此泄气，她说：“东西现在没有，大家来想办法。”
    不久，姬阿巧在地区党支部积极支持下，同组员们在一起用废油桶搪成一只炉子，用陶土大水缸改装成储水箱，与隔壁学校商量接上了自来水，找到了人家放在一边不用的莲蓬头，又在附近劳动公园路边上找到两只旧瓷面盆，拿来修理好，装在浴室里当作洗脸盆。姬阿巧东奔西跑把材料凑齐后，又把服务组的两个烘衣间并成一间，请来东方浴室热心的工人帮助安装水管和水龙头。姬阿巧寸步不离地忙了三整天，直到全部完工，放出热水，她才放了心。就这样，一个同一时间可供十人洗澡的简易女子浴室诞生了。
    姬阿巧这种把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人，以帮助人为乐事的忘我的共产主义精神，影响了家务服务组的每个成员，她们服务认真，邻里之间互相帮助成为风气。
    姬阿巧的劳动，受到人们的尊敬和爱戴。四周居民和工人都把她当做学习的榜样，许多职工写了热情洋溢的表扬信和大字报给居委会，感谢姬阿巧和服务组的帮助。新通机器厂一个木工看见姬阿巧没有针线盒，针包在布头里容易刺痛手，就做了一只盒子送她，还漆上油漆，让她放针线、碎布。服务组的大姐们搞技术革新时，附近厂里的工人知道了，立即前来支援，先后帮她们制成功手摇的和脚踏的洗衣机、甩水机等七、八种半机械化设备，大姐们的工作因此搞得更欢了。
