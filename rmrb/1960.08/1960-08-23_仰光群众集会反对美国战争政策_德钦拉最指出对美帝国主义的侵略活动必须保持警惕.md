　　Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, August 21st: A mass rally was held in Yangon on the afternoon of the 21st, calling on the people of Burma and peace-loving people around the world to oppose the war and aggressive policies of US imperialism and to fight to defend world peace. The rally was initiated by the Burma National United Front.

　　The masses participating in the rally entered the venue holding flags and shouting slogans such as "Down with imperialism" and "Long live the peace-loving people of the world."

　　Thakin Lwin, a member of the Presidium of the Burma National United Front and Vice Chairman of the Burma Trade Union Congress, spoke at the mass rally. When he spoke about US imperialism and its running dogs actively preparing for wars of aggression, he said, "We must not lose our vigilance, because as long as US imperialism exists, there is a possibility of a world war breaking out."

　　Thakin Lwin pointed out that the imperialist aggressive blocs of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the Central Treaty Organization are establishing military bases in other countries. US imperialism and the reactionary Japanese government recently signed a new military treaty. It still occupies Taiwan, an inseparable territory of China, and is arming West Germany with modern equipment and nuclear weapons in an attempt to revive German militarism. Moreover, the United States intends to station nuclear submarines equipped with "Polaris" missiles in the Pacific region. He said: "All this fully shows that US imperialism is actively preparing for war."

　　Thakin Lwin said: "Due to the existence of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and their efforts to strive for peace, US imperialism does not dare to launch a war recklessly." He expressed his firm belief that the peace-loving people of the world will ultimately be victorious, and US imperialism will inevitably suffer a shameful end.

　　Among those attending the mass rally were Thakin Lun, Chairman of the Burma Trade Union Congress; U Tin Pe Myint and Zheng Bida, members of the Presidium of the Burma National United Front; Bo Bo Kun, Chairman of the People's Comrade Party; Mon Ba Kyaw, a member of Parliament from the Mon People's Front; U Shwe Pyaw, Chairman of the Yangon Peace Committee; Saw Gan, Chairman of the All Burma Karen National Organization; and U Mya Myint, General Secretary of the Burma Trade Union Congress.

　　Finally, the conference unanimously adopted resolutions on disarmament and the cessation of aggression.

    仰光群众集会反对美国战争政策
    德钦拉最指出对美帝国主义的侵略活动必须保持警惕
    新华社仰光21日电　仰光21日下午举行群众大会，号召缅甸人民和全世界爱好和平的人民反对美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，为保卫世界和平而斗争。这次大会是由缅甸民族团结阵线发起的。
    参加大会的群众拿着旗帜在高呼“打倒帝国主义”，“世界爱好和平的人民万岁”等口号声中进入会场。
    缅甸民族团结阵线主席团委员和缅甸工会大会副主席德钦拉最在群众大会上讲话。他谈到美帝国主义及其走狗积极准备侵略战争的时候说，“我们决不能丧失警惕，因为美帝国主义存在着，就有可能爆发世界大战。”
    德钦拉最指出，帝国主义侵略集团东南亚条约组织、北大西洋公约组织和中央条约组织正在其他国家建立军事基地，美帝国主义和日本反动政府最近签订了新的军事条约。它至今仍然霸占着中国的不可分割的领土台湾，并正在用现代化装备和核武器武装西德，企图复活德国军国主义。而且，美国还打算在沿太平洋地区停驻配备“北极星”式火箭的核潜水艇。他说：“所有这一切，充分说明美帝国主义正在积极备战。”
    德钦拉最说：“由于以苏联为首的社会主义国家的存在和它们尽力争取和平，美帝国主义不敢悍然发动战争。”他表示坚信，世界爱好和平的人民最终将获得胜利，美帝国主义肯定要遭到可耻的下场。
    出席群众大会的有缅甸工会大会主席德钦伦、缅甸民族团结阵线主席团委员吴登佩密和郑丕达、人民同志党主席波波昆、孟族人民阵线议员孟波乔、仰光和平委员会主席吴瑞彪、全缅克伦族组织主席苏干和缅甸工会大会总书记吴苗密。
    最后，大会一致通过了关于裁军、制止侵略等决议。
