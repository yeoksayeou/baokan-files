Xinhua News Agency, August 26th dispatch from Leopoldville: "UN forces" in the Congo deployed at Leopoldville airport on the 25th in an attempt to prevent the Congolese government from regaining control of the airport.

According to reports, "UN forces" dug trenches and set up machine guns there. A "UN forces" officer said he had received orders to "resist" any "attacks" by Congolese troops and was prepared to carry out the order.

Leopoldville airport is currently under the control of the "UN forces" manipulated by the United States, and the Congolese government has requested to regain control of the airport.

In Thysville, Leopoldville Province, Congolese troops demanded that "UN forces" withdraw from there.

    “联合国军”强占利奥波德维尔机场
    新华社26日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：在刚果的“联合国军”25日在利奥波德维尔机场布防，企图阻止刚果政府收回这个机场。
    据报道，“联合国军”在那里挖掘战壕并且架起了机枪。“联合国军”的一个军官说，他已接到了“抵抗”刚果军队任何“攻击”的命令并且准备执行这项命令。
    利奥波德维尔机场目前是在美国所操纵的“联合国军”控制下，刚果政府已经要求收回机场控制权。
    在利奥波德维尔省的太斯维尔城，刚果军队要求“联合国军”从那里撤出。
    据新华社27日讯　纽约消息：联合国方面宣布，正在继续派新的联合国部队去刚果，准备把在刚果的“联合国军”从目前的一万五千人增加到一万七千人。
    美国通讯社美联社记者哈勒耳森26日在报道这个消息时说，“不管卢蒙巴怎样说，没有或者几乎没有任何目前撤退联合国军队的可能性”。
