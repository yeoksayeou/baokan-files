    Strengthen Ideological Education, Formulate Concrete Measures, Guarantee a Bumper Harvest
    Jiangxi Sends 480,000 Cadres to the Countryside to Vigorously Grasp the Quality of Early Rice Harvest
    Guangfeng County, in the Spirit of Looking Ahead and Practicing Economy, Makes Early Arrangements for People's Grain Consumption
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) Jiangxi Province has sent 480,000 cadres deep into the front lines of the summer harvest to lead the masses in carrying out a bumper harvest campaign for early rice. With the deepening of this campaign, the quality of early rice harvesting in various parts of the province has been greatly improved. The more than 12 million mu of early rice that have been harvested have generally been carefully harvested and threshed, ensuring that every grain is returned to the granary, achieving a bumper harvest.
    Recently, the early rice in Jiangxi Province has successively entered the season of large-scale harvesting. This year, the province overcame the continuous 40-day cold wave and low-temperature disaster in spring and summer, and achieved a bumper harvest of early rice. At present, in order to ensure that all early rice is reaped without losing a single grain, the Party committees at all levels, while emphasizing seizing the season and rushing the speed, require cadres at all levels on the front line of the summer harvest to conscientiously grasp the quality of the harvest, lead and organize the masses to vigorously carry out the bumper harvest campaign, to ensure that early rice achieves "ten percent harvest for ten percent yield."
    In the early rice bumper harvest campaign, cadres at all levels participate in harvesting, lead harvesting, and go deep among the masses to extensively educate the masses about bumper harvests using concrete facts. More than 200,000 cadres in Jiujiang, Yichun, Shangrao and other regions went deep into the harvesting, threshing, and drying fields, participating in labor while using the method of comparing careful harvesting and threshing with rough harvesting and threshing to educate the masses about bumper harvests. This promptly reversed and overcame the erroneous thinking of some people who believed that "early rice has a bumper harvest, it doesn't matter if a few grains are wasted." Zhou Hongxian, the first secretary of the Jishui County Party Committee, participated in threshing at the Wujiang Commune. He discovered that many grains of rice had not been threshed cleanly on the stalks. He immediately organized the commune members to re-thresh them, and as a result, more than nine catties of rice were re-threshed per mu. Zhou Hongxian used this example to guide the commune members to calculate the losses and wastage in detail, and explained to them the principle of "accumulating small amounts to make a large amount, and trickles forming a river." This made every commune member establish the idea of loving and cherishing grain, and everyone consciously carried out careful harvesting and threshing. The harvest per mu of early rice in the entire commune increased by more than ten catties compared to the original.
    While comprehensively strengthening ideological education, cadres at all levels went deep among the masses, summarized experiences, and adopted effective measures in every link to ensure a bumper harvest. According to the five links of harvesting, threshing, drying, transporting, and storing, various parts of the Gannan Administrative Region formulated five major measures for careful harvesting and threshing through joint discussions between cadres, veteran farmers, and commune members: 1. Divide the fields into rows and harvest at the right time to prevent over-ripening and grain loss and mildew; 2. Strictly follow the operating procedures for harvesting and threshing, harvesting should be done gently and carefully, cutting neatly and cleanly, and threshing should be done by lifting the stalks lightly and hitting them hard, ensuring that the stalks and ground are clean; 3. Sweep the threshing grounds clean to prevent spoilage by poultry and livestock; 4. Organize children's re-harvesting teams to pick up grain and ears; 5. Strengthen storage and management, dry frequently, and prevent mildew and rot. The People's Communes in Huichang and Longnan counties conscientiously implemented the "five measures" under the leadership of cadres. The more than 100,000 mu of early rice that have been harvested have all been thoroughly harvested, threshed, picked, and swept clean upon inspection. In the past, in many places in Wanzai, Jishui, Wan'an and other counties, people were accustomed to using dragging buckets to thresh rice, and the buckets were moved as they threshed, resulting in a lot of grain being scattered. After cadres and commune members jointly researched and summarized experiences, they have now changed to using seated buckets for threshing, fixing the location of the buckets, and installing rice curtains or laying bamboo mats around the buckets to prevent grain from being scattered. At the beginning, the management system of the drying ground of Luotian Commune in Xiajiang County was not strict, so the Party committee secretary and the branch secretaries of the major brigades personally went to the drying grounds to help the women and elderly people responsible for drying the grain to study and formulate a set of management systems, which eliminated losses and waste.
    Strengthening labor organization and labor management is an important aspect of ensuring improved harvest quality. Cadres in various places attach importance to grasping this issue. Many People's Communes in Xiushui, Hukou, Jiujiang, Xingzi and other counties have formed specialized teams (groups) for harvesting, threshing, transporting, turning, and storing, based on the production team as a unit and according to the ability and expertise of the commune members. They have also established a "four-determination" responsibility system of fixed quality, fixed quantity, fixed work points, and fixed rewards, which further strengthens the sense of responsibility of the commune members in production, ensuring both quality and quantity in the harvest. In addition, the personnel sent to the countryside to support the rush harvest are organized in a way that they are matched with the commune members to help them become familiar with and master the harvesting techniques, ensuring the quality of the harvest.
    Now, with the full unfolding of the bumper harvest campaign, cadres in various places are also leading the masses to create and establish benchmarks, launching a high-quality competition. A large number of high-quality "model harvesting teams" and "red flag threshing teams" combining cadres and commune members have emerged in many areas.
    (Dispatch from this newspaper, Nanchang, 30th) Guangfeng County, Jiangxi, after the early rice harvest, has made early arrangements for people's grain consumption based on the principle of increasing production and practicing economy.
    Guangfeng County, by adhering to the principle of living prosperous days as poor days, saved more than 6 million catties of grain in the county's 1,600-plus canteens from July of last year to July of this year, an average of 17 catties of grain saved per person. This year, Guangfeng County also made early arrangements for the people's grain consumption before the early rice harvest. The method of arrangement is: first, conduct a realistic discussion among all the people. "Realistic discussion" means a comprehensive summary of grain consumption experience to unify different ideological understandings. "Implementation" means mobilizing the entire people to open up avenues for increasing production and practicing economy, and formulating a plan for saving grain consumption after the early rice harvest. Now, after careful evaluation and summary by the entire Party and the entire people, the county has selected more than 22,000 model households for grain consumption and 42 advanced canteens for grain consumption. The county also held a conference of representatives for saving grain consumption, commending and rewarding advanced individuals and advanced collectives, setting an example for implementing the saving of grain consumption after the early rice harvest. In order to promote the experiences summarized from the bottom up, the Guangfeng County Party Committee launched a study campaign among the entire people, and publicized the policies of "looking ahead and behind, making up for deficiencies with surpluses, practicing economy, and leaving room" and "storing more and consuming less" through various forms.
    On the basis of the realistic discussion among all the people, Guangfeng County also carried out implementation of increasing production and practicing economy, and took concrete measures to ensure the comprehensive realization of saving grain consumption after the early rice harvest. The main measures are: grain management work should be politically led, the finance and trade departments should learn to guide the masses in grain consumption, and the harvesting, management, and consumption of early rice should be carried out in a one-stop manner. Recently, management agencies for grain have been established in various communes, production brigades, production teams, and canteens. Under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, they strictly grasp policies and carry out grain procurement, distribution, storage, transportation, and management. The grain departments of the county organized more than 200 cadres to go deep into various rural canteens, adopting the method of first being students and then teachers, and actually researching methods of saving grain consumption while learning to cook. The grain management departments at the commune level also trained more than 2,000 canteen administrators and brigade custodians.
    Establishing a one-stop process for harvesting, managing, and consuming early rice is an important method for saving grain from the beginning and comprehensively. Under the requirement of threshing 20 catties of rice per mu more, Guangfeng County organized a one-stop harvesting organization for harvesting, threshing, transporting, drying, and picking, and decided to re-thresh the early rice once to achieve a bumper harvest and ensure that every grain is returned to the granary. In order to manage the early rice well, in addition to running training courses for grain custodians and administrators in production teams and canteens, the county has also made preparations for separating grain for rations, seed grain, and feed grain. Each production brigade has also built three sets of warehouses and established three major systems of unified management, unified processing, and specialized custodians. Because the grain department helped various communes to repair and renovate 40 water mills, and each production brigade processing team was responsible for processing, each 100 catties of rice produced seven catties more rice than in the past, becoming an important way for the county to save grain consumption. In terms of saving grain consumption, the county launched a large-scale planting of melons and vegetables before the early rice harvest. Now, an average of 40 pumpkin plants have been planted per person, and each person has reached one fen and four li of vegetable land.

    加强思想教育　制订具体措施　保证丰产丰收
    江西48万干部下乡狠抓早稻收获质量
    广丰县本着瞻前顾后细水长流精神及早安排群众用粮
    本报讯　江西省四十八万干部深入夏收第一线，领导群众开展早稻丰产丰收运动。随着这个运动深入展开，现在全省各地早稻收获质量大大提高，已收获的一千二百多万亩早稻普遍做到了精收细打，颗粒还家，丰产丰收。
    最近以来，江西省的早稻相继进入大割季节。今年全省经过战胜春夏连续四十天的寒潮低温灾害，取得了早稻丰收。当前，为把全部早稻颗粒不丢地拿到手，各级党委在强调争季节抢速度的同时，要求各级到夏收第一线的干部必须扎扎实实抓收获质量，领导和组织群众大力开展丰产丰收运动，以确保早稻做到“十成年景十成收”。
    在早稻丰产丰收运动中，各级干部参加收割领导收割，深入群众，用具体事实广泛向群众进行丰产丰收的教育。九江、宜春、上饶等专区二十多万干部深入收割、打谷、晒谷现场，一边参加劳动，一边用细打细收和粗打粗收对比的方法向群众进行丰产丰收教育，及时扭转和克服了部分群众认为“早稻丰产了，浪费几粒谷不算什么”的错误思想。吉水县县委第一书记周鸿先在乌江公社参加打禾，发现禾秆上有许多谷粒没有打净，当场即组织社员复打一遍，结果每亩田又复打出九斤多谷。周鸿先用这个事例引导社员算损失浪费细账，向社员讲清“积少成多，滴水成河”的道理，使社员个个树立起爱粮惜粮的思想，人人自觉地进行细打细收，全社早稻每亩收获量比原来增加十斤以上。
    在全面加强思想教育的同时，各级干部深入群众，总结经验，从每个环节上采取有效措施，保证丰产丰收。赣南行政区各地根据收、打、晒、运、藏五个环节，通过干部与老农、社员共同座谈，共同商量，制定了细打细收的五大措施是：一、分田排队，适时收割，防止过熟掉粒、霉烂；二、严格割、打操作规程，收割要轻割轻放、割齐割净，打禾轻提重打、秆净地净；三、晒场扫净收净，防止禽畜糟蹋；四、组织儿童复收队，拣粮拣穗；五、加强贮藏保管，勤晾多晒，不霉不烂。会昌、龙南两县各人民公社在干部领导下认真贯彻“五项措施”，已收获的十万多亩早稻，经检查都做到了割净、打净、拣净、扫净。万载、吉水、万安等县许多地方过去群众习惯用拖桶打禾，禾桶随打随搬，抛撒掉粒很多。经过干部和社员共同研究、总结经验以后，现在都改为座桶打禾，固定禾桶地点，在禾桶四周安了禾帐或在禾桶下铺设篾垫，以防止谷子抛撒。峡江县罗田公社开始晒谷场管理制度不严，党委书记和各大队支部书记就亲自到各晒场帮助负责晒谷的妇女、老人研究制定了一套管理制度，杜绝了损失浪费。
    加强劳动组织和劳动管理，是保证提高收获质量的一个重要方面。各地干部重视抓这个问题。修水、湖口、九江、星子等县许多人民公社，都以生产小队为单位，按社员能力、特长组成收割、打谷、搬运、翻晒、保管专业队（组），并相应建立了定质、定量、定工分、定奖励的“四定”责任制，进一步加强了社员生产责任心，在收获中做到既保质又保量。此外，各地对下乡支援抢收的人员，在劳动组织上都采取了和社员互相搭配的办法，帮助他们熟悉和掌握收割技术，保证收割质量。
    现在，随着丰产丰收运动的全面展开，各地干部还带领群众创标兵、立标兵，掀起了高质量大竞赛。许多地区已经出现了大批干部、社员两结合的高质量“标兵收割队”、“红旗打禾队”。
    本报南昌30日电　江西广丰县在早稻收割后，本着增产节约的原则，及早地安排好群众用粮。
    广丰县由于坚持把富日子当穷日子过，从去年7月到今年7月，全县一千六百多个食堂就节约了六百多万斤粮食，平均每人节约粮食十七斤。今年广丰县又在早稻收割以前，及早地安排了群众用粮。安排的方法是：首先在全民中进行务虚论实。务虚，即全面总结用粮经验，统一各种不同的思想认识。论实，即发动全民广开增产节约门路，制定早稻收割后节约用粮的计划。现在全县经过全党全民认真的评比、总结，共评选出二万二千多用粮模范户，四十二个用粮先进食堂。全县还召开了节约用粮代表大会，表扬与奖励先进个人和先进集体，为贯彻早稻收割后节约用粮树立了榜样。中共广丰县委为推广这些自下而上总结出的经验，又在全民中开展了一次学习运动，并通过各种形式，大张旗鼓地宣传了“瞻前顾后、以丰补歉、细水长流、留有余地”和“多储备、少吃用”的方针政策。
    广丰县在全民务虚的基础上，又开展了增产节约的论实，并采取具体措施，保证早稻收割后全面实现节约用粮。主要的措施是：粮食管理工作实行政治挂帅，财贸部门学会指导群众用粮，早稻收、管、用实行一条龙。最近各公社、生产大队、生产队和食堂都成立了管理粮食的机构，在各级党组织领导下，严格掌握政策，进行粮食征购、分配、储备、调运、保管工作。全县粮食部门组织二百多个干部，深入到各个农村食堂，采取先当学生后当先生的办法，在学习做饭中，实际研究节约用粮的办法。公社一级的粮食管理部门还训练了二千多名食堂管理员和大队保管员。
    建立早稻收、管、用一条龙，是从头节约、全面节约用粮的一项重要方法。广丰县在每亩多打二十斤稻谷的要求下，组织了收、打、运、晒、拾一条龙收割组织，并决定做到早稻重打一遍，以达到丰产丰收，颗粒还家。为保管好早稻，全县除开办了生产队、食堂粮食保管员、管理员训练班以外，并已做好了口粮、种子粮、饲料粮三分开的准备，各生产大队并修了三套仓库，建立了统一管理、统一加工和专人保管的三大制度。由于粮食部门帮助各公社修好与整理了四十个水碾，并由每个生产大队加工小组负责加工，就使每百斤稻谷比过去多出七斤米，成为全县节约用粮的一项重要门路。在节约用粮方面，全县在早稻收割以前，开展了大种瓜菜运动，现在平均每人已种下南瓜四十棵，蔬菜地每人达到了一分四厘。
