Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, August 12th: The new government of Ceylon announced in a policy statement today that in foreign affairs it will maintain a policy of non-alignment, neutrality, and peaceful coexistence.

The Governor-General of Ceylon, Goonetilleke, read out the policy statement of the new government organized by the Ceylon Freedom Party at the opening ceremony of the new parliament held at Independence Square this morning. The statement also said that the government will take steps to amend the constitution and establish a republican form of government.

The new government announced that in order to implement the government's policy of gradual nationalization, life insurance companies will be nationalized, and laws will be enacted to manage and control general insurance businesses. The statement indicated that "the government does not consider it beneficial to nationalize plantations."

The government announced that it will establish a national education system and is preparing to enact laws to take over all subsidized tertiary schools. Subsidized primary and secondary schools will also be taken over, but those schools will be allowed to continue operating as private schools under the education law without accepting state subsidies.

Schools in Ceylon are graded according to their efficiency and facilities. Catholic schools currently receive the largest share of government financial assistance.

The statement said that the government will also introduce legislation to take over the newspapers controlled by the "Ceylon Newspapers Ltd." and "Times of Ceylon," and transfer these newspapers to public companies with unlimited share capital established according to law. In these companies, the shares held by individuals will be limited. The statement believes that this law will prevent abuses in the press due to poorly constituted monopolies.

In other economic policies, the government announced its intention to lower the prices of staple foods and other commodities; provide farmers with generous loans; establish institutions to accelerate the planned development of economic resources; and expand export markets for products and increase new trading areas.

In addition, the statement also mentioned that the new government will appoint a committee to investigate the assassination of the late Prime Minister Bandaranaike from a political perspective, and to resolve issues such as the Indian-origin residents in Ceylon.

    锡兰新政府发表施政方针
    宣告将保持中立和共处的政策
    新华社科伦坡12日电　锡兰新政府在今天发表的政策声明中宣告，它在外交方面将保持不参加国家集团、中立和共处的政策。
    锡兰总督古?狄莱克今天上午在独立广场举行的新议会开幕仪式上宣读了锡兰自由党所组织的新政府的政策声明。声明还说，政府将采取步骤来修改宪法和建立共和国的政府形式。
    新政府宣布，为了执行政府的逐步的国有化政策，人寿保险企业将收归国有，将制订法律来管理和控制一般的保险事业。声明表示，“政府并不认为把种植园收归国有是有利的。”
    政府宣布将建立国家的教育制度，准备制订法律来接管所有受津贴的第三级学校。受津贴的第一级和第二级学校也将予以接管，但是将允许那些学校在不接受国家津贴的条件下依据教育法作为私立学校继续开办。
    锡兰的学校是根据学校的效率和设备而分级的。天主教会学校目前取得政府最大部分的财政援助。
    声明说，政府还将提出法律，接管“锡兰报业联合公司”和“锡兰时报公司”控制的报纸，并把这些报纸交给依法设立的无限股份资本的公营公司。在这些公司中，个人保有的股份将受到限制。声明认为，这项法律将防止在报界由于组成不良的垄断组织而造成弊端。
    在其他经济政策方面，政府宣布打算抑低主要食品和其他商品的价格；向农民提供条件宽大的贷款，设立机构加速有计划地开发经济资源；扩大产品对外输出市场和增加新的贸易区。
    此外，声明还提到新政府将任命一个委员会就政治方面来调查暗杀故总理班达拉奈克的事件，和解决锡兰境内印度血统居民等问题。
