Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd Dispatch from New York: The United Nations Security Council, at the request of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, held another meeting yesterday to discuss the Congo issue.

Hammarskjöld requested this meeting after the Congolese government declared that it had lost confidence in him, exposing his conspiracy to control the Congo for the United States, which was a major setback.

On the eve of the Security Council debate, Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba telegraphed the President of the Security Council, accusing Hammarskjöld's activities in the Congo of being "a tacit recognition of the secession of Katanga Province" and implying that "the United Nations will not provide the Congolese government with any assistance to restore domestic order and national territorial integrity." The telegram said that everything that has happened so far is as if "the United Nations headquarters in the Congo wants to replace the government of the (Congolese) Republic."

Lumumba's telegram also stated that the Congolese government affirms its complete trust in the United Nations organization and "eagerly awaits the UN's decision with confidence."

Hammarskjöld spoke three times at the meeting, trying his best to defend his activities and those of the "UN forces" he had assembled in the Congo. He demanded that the Congolese government allow him and the UN forces to carry out activities freely in the Congo in order to ultimately place the Congo completely under neo-colonial rule. He said that only if "trust that transcends national and racial considerations can be obtained" can the United Nations "help" the Congo. He also said that he believed the Security Council "would not wish to continue dealing with" the Congolese government's accusations against him.

Hammarskjöld then threatened that if these activities against the United Nations continued, it might "ultimately force me to propose that the question of those activities be reconsidered by the appropriate United Nations body."

Hammarskjöld also attempted to deny his actions of disregarding the Congolese central government and his collusion with the Tshombe traitorous clique in splitting the Congo. However, he had to admit that he had taken action against the Congolese central government "very firmly" and said, "We cannot actively support the efforts of the (Congolese) central government (to unify the country) in violation of the two principles stated here (in the Security Council)." He argued that "it should not be concluded from the fact that we cannot support the central government that we have given any support to the other side to strengthen its power or resist any action by the central government."

Representatives from the United States, Britain, France, and other countries supported Hammarskjöld's activities in the Congo in their speeches. US Representative Lodge urged people not to look for Hammarskjöld's "minor shortcomings." He also clamored that the United States opposed any "intrusion" into the Congo by any party other than the United Nations controlled by the United States. Lodge also opposed the Congolese Republic government's request to withdraw white troops from the UN forces in the Congo.

Congolese Republic representative, Congolese Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga, refuted Hammarskjöld's nonsense in his speech and accused him of concealing his intentions and the situation of his talks with Katanga Province Governor Tshombe from the Congolese central government. The Congolese representative reiterated the Congolese government's determination to safeguard its independence and territorial integrity. He emphasized that the Congolese Republic government and the Congolese people cannot agree to be handed over to neo-colonialism after the Congo's independence.

Gizenga then, on behalf of the Congolese government, demanded that the task of guarding all airports and seaports in the Congo must be handed over to the Congolese army; the United Nations armed forces must immediately disarm all Belgians in Katanga Province; and Belgian troops must completely and unconditionally withdraw from the Kitona and Kamina bases.

Guinean representative Sory, who was allowed to attend the meeting, severely condemned the colonialist groups' conspiracy against the Congo in his speech. Sory pointed out that this conspiracy was jointly formed by all colonialist forces, and its purpose was to put "most African countries in a state of subjugation."

The Guinean representative emphasized that the struggle over the Congo issue is not merely a struggle between the Congolese people and the imperialist forces, but also a struggle for the entire African people to achieve complete independence and get rid of all colonialist interference and control.

Soviet representative Kuznetzov pointed out in his speech that the United Nations' actions in the Congo violate the interests of African security and peace.

Kuznetzov pointed out that Hammarskjöld has already placed a large number of officers from member states of the North Atlantic military bloc in the "UN forces" headquarters, and also intends to send more troops from North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries to the Congo.

When talking about Hammarskjöld's so-called "technical assistance to the Congo" plan, Kuznetzov said that this plan is to forcibly put new colonial yokes on independent countries.

Kuznetzov pointed out that the United States has already used this plan to infiltrate the Congo under the "United Nations" banner. Kuznetzov said that twenty-one of the sixty-five so-called "experts" sent to the Congo were Americans.

Polish representative Lewandovski expressed his support for the Soviet Union's proposal to immediately stop the implementation of Hammarskjöld's so-called "aid to the Congo plan."

The Security Council adjourned at 1:47 AM New York time this morning without passing any resolutions.

    刚果代表在联合国安理会坚定宣布
    不能容许新殖民主义者控制刚果
    哈马舍尔德和洛奇等为分裂刚果的阴谋活动辩护并威胁刚果政府
    新华社22日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会应联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的要求，昨天再一次举行会议，讨论刚果问题。
    哈马舍尔德是在刚果政府声明对他已经失去信任，使他为美国控制刚果而奔走的阴谋大败露之后，要求召开这次会议的。
    在安理会辩论前夕，刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴打电报给安理会主席，指责哈马舍尔德在刚果的活动是“默然承认了刚果的加丹加省的分裂”，意味着“联合国将不给予刚果政府以帮助恢复国内秩序和国家领土完整的任何援助”。电报说，到目前为止发生的一切就好像是“在刚果的联合国总部想要取代（刚果）共和国的政府”。
    卢蒙巴的电报又说，刚果政府确认它是完全信任联合国组织的，并且“满怀信心地急切等待联合国作出决定”。
    哈马舍尔德在会上三次发言，竭力为他以及他拼凑的“联合国军”在刚果的活动辩护。他要求刚果政府听任他以及联合国军队在刚果放手进行活动，以实现其最后把刚果完全置于新殖民统治下的目的。他说什么只有在“能够得到超越民族和种族的考虑的信任的情况下”，联合国对刚果才能有所“帮助”。他还说，他认为安理会“不会希望继续处理”刚果政府对他的指责。
    哈马舍尔德接着威胁说，如果这些反对联合国的活动继续下去的话，可能“最后迫使我提出由适当的联合国机构重新考虑那些活动的问题”。
    哈马舍尔德还企图抵赖他目无刚果中央政府的行动以及他同冲伯卖国集团之间所进行的分裂刚果的勾当。但是，他又不得不承认，他曾经“非常坚定地”对刚果中央政府采取行动，并且说，“我们不能违反两次在这里（安理会）阐明的原则来积极支持（刚果）中央政府（统一全国）的努力”。他狡辩说，“不应该从我们不能支持中央政府这个事实得出结论说，我们给了另外一方任何支持来加强它的力量或者抗拒中央政府的任何行动”。
    美、英、法等国代表在发言中都支持哈马舍尔德在刚果的活动。美国代表洛奇要人们不要寻找哈马舍尔德的“小缺点”。他并且叫嚣说，除了美国所控制的联合国以外，美国反对任何方面对刚果的“侵入”。洛奇还反对刚果共和国政府方面提出的撤退在刚果的联合国军中的白人军队的要求。
    刚果共和国代表、刚果副总理基赞加在发言中驳斥了哈马舍尔德的胡言，并且指责他一直把他的意图和他同加丹加省长冲伯会谈的情况瞒着刚果中央政府。刚果代表重申刚果政府决心维护它的独立和领土完整。他强调，刚果共和国政府和刚果人民不能同意在刚果独立之后就被移交给新殖民主义。
    基赞加接着代表刚果政府要求把刚果所有的机场和海港的警戒任务必须交给刚果军队来执行；联合国武装部队必须立即解除在加丹加省所有比利时人的武装；比利时军队必须完全和无条件地从基托纳和加米纳基地撤退。
    要求出席会议而得到同意的几内亚代表索里在发言中严厉地谴责了殖民主义集团反对刚果的阴谋。索里指出，这个阴谋是由所有殖民主义势力共同组成，它的目的是要使“非洲大多数国家处于屈从状态之下”。
    几内亚代表强调，在刚果问题上的斗争并不仅仅是刚果人民反对帝国主义势力的斗争，而且也是整个非洲人民争取完全独立、摆脱所有殖民主义者的干涉和控制的斗争。
    苏联代表库兹?佐夫在发言中指出，联合国在刚果的行动违反非洲的安全和和平的利益。
    库兹?佐夫指出，哈马舍尔德已经把大批北大西洋军事集团成员国的军官安插在“联合国军”司令部里，而且还打算派更多的北大西洋集团国家的军队到刚果去。
    库兹?佐夫在谈到哈马舍尔德所谓“给予刚果技术援助”计划时说，这个计划是强把新的殖民主义枷锁套在独立国家上。
    库兹?佐夫指出，美国已经利用了这个计划，在“联合国”招牌下渗入刚果。库兹?佐夫说，派到刚果去的六十五个所谓“专家”中有二十一个是美国人。
    波兰代表利文道夫斯基表示支持苏联提出的立即停止执行哈马舍尔德的所谓“援助刚果计划”。
    安全理事会一直开到纽约时间今天早上一时四十七分才结束，没有通过任何决议。
