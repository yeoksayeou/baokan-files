Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 8th: People from all walks of life in Liaoning Province and Shenyang City held a grand rally this afternoon to warmly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Liberation of Korea.

    The delegation from the China-Korea Friendship Association, which came to our country to participate in the celebrations for the 15th anniversary of the Liberation of Korea, attended today's celebration meeting. At 3:00 p.m., when all the distinguished guests, headed by Kim Jong-heng, Minister of Higher Education of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Standing Committee Member of the China-Korea Friendship Association, ascended the rostrum accompanied by Huang Oudong, Second Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the CPC and Governor of Liaoning Province, Li Huang, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the CPC and President of the Liaoning Branch of the China-Korea Friendship Association, Qiu Youwen, Vice Governor of Liaoning Province, Lieutenant General Zeng Siyu, Head of the Shenyang Garrison, Wu Tieming, Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the CPC, etc., the entire audience stood up and gave them a long and warm applause.

    Li Huang, President of the Liaoning Branch of the China-Korea Friendship Association, announced the opening of the meeting. The orchestra played the national anthems of China and Korea. Young Pioneers from Shenyang presented flowers to the Korean friends.

    Huang Oudong, Second Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the CPC and Governor of Liaoning Province, first spoke at the meeting. On behalf of the people of Liaoning Province, he extended warm festive greetings to the glorious Workers' Party of Korea and the heroic Korean people, and expressed a warm welcome to all the distinguished guests of the China-Korea Friendship Association delegation.

    In his speech, Huang Oudong elaborated on the brilliant achievements made by the Korean people in the socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past fifteen years, as well as the great victory achieved by the Korean people in the struggle against U.S. imperialism. He said that the victory of the Korean people is the victory of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the victory of the Chinese people. We regard the spirit of hard work and struggle of the Korean people as a model to learn from.

    Huang Oudong said: The people of China and Korea have a deep traditional friendship. Our friendship has been consolidated and developed in the struggle against our common enemy, imperialism, and is cemented by the blood of the people of the two countries. In recent years, the unity between the people of China and Korea has been further strengthened and developed.

    Huang Oudong emphasized that our socialist countries have always loved peace. But we know that to defend peace, we must unremittingly struggle against imperialism. U.S. imperialism is still entrenched in South Korea, undermining the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and constantly violating the armistice agreement, creating a threat of war. He said: The war-mongering U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Korean people, the mortal enemy of the Asian people, and the mortal enemy of the people of the world. We must see that the nature of U.S. imperialism will never change. Only by waging a resolute struggle against it can we force it to bow its head. We must not harbor unrealistic illusions about U.S. imperialism.

    Huang Oudong finally said: The current situation is unprecedentedly favorable for the struggle of the people of the world for peace. Under the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the life of imperialism headed by the United States will not be long, and the day when the Korean people realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland will not be far away. We firmly believe that Korea, with its three thousand miles of beautiful mountains and rivers, will surely achieve reunification, and the Korean people, with their four thousand years of long history, will eventually be reunited.

    Kim Jong-heng, head of the China-Korea Friendship Association delegation, spoke amidst warm applause. He said: Liaoning Province is separated from Korea only by a river, and the road of economic and cultural exchanges and mutual contact friendship between the people of China and Korea runs through Liaoning Province. Liaoning and other regions in Northeast China are revolutionary sites that will forever shine in the history of friendship between the people of China and Korea. Korean communists, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, once carried out a heroic anti-Japanese armed struggle for fifteen years in this region together with the Chinese people. We are extremely happy to be able to celebrate the national holiday of our motherland with you in such a meaningful place.

    Kim Jong-heng said: The struggle launched by the people of China and Korea against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, more clearly shows the invincible power of the friendly unity of our two peoples. The blood shed by the outstanding Chinese sons and daughters on the beautiful mountains and rivers of Korea will never disappear, and the noble spirit of internationalism they demonstrated will forever be engraved in the hearts of the Korean people. During the post-war recovery period of the Korean people, the Chinese people gave us great material and technical assistance. Recently, the support of the people of Beijing and other parts of China for the struggle of the South Korean people against U.S. imperialism has greatly encouraged the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. No force can destroy this traditional friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea.

    After warmly congratulating the Chinese people on the great achievements they have made in socialist construction, Kim Jong-heng introduced the rapid development of industry and agriculture in Korea since its liberation fifteen years ago. He said that today, the people in the northern half of Korea are living a happy and prosperous life, and are galloping forward along the victorious road on the Chollima. Today, U.S. imperialists are still entrenched in South Korea, acting wildly and domineeringly. If the U.S. imperialists still refuse to get out of South Korea and China's Taiwan, and continue to make provocations, they are destined to suffer a more disastrous defeat than in the Korean War.

    Kim Jong-heng finally said: The Korean people will do everything in their power to further consolidate the friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea and the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and will forever advance together with the Chinese people in the struggle to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world.

    Their speeches constantly aroused warm applause.

    Also participating in today's celebration meeting were Song Guang, Zhang Panxin, Vice Mayors of Shenyang, and the Secretary-General and Directors of the Liaoning Branch of the China-Korea Friendship Association, as well as the heads of local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations. After the meeting, the Korean film "Love the Future" was shown.

    沈阳盛会庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年
    以金钟恒团长为首的朝中友协代表团参加大会受到热烈欢迎
    新华社沈阳8日电　辽宁省和沈阳市各界人民今天下午隆重集会，热烈庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年。
    前来我国参加朝鲜解放十五周年庆祝活动的朝中友好协会代表团，参加了今天的庆祝大会。下午三时，当以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国高等教育相、朝中友好协会常务委员金钟恒为首的全体贵宾，在中共辽宁省委第二书记、辽宁省省长黄欧东，中共辽宁省委书记、中朝友好协会辽宁省分会会长李荒，辽宁省副省长仇友文，沈阳驻军首长曾思玉中将，中共沈阳市委书记吴铁鸣等陪同下登上主席台时，全场起立，报以长时间的热烈掌声。
    中朝友好协会辽宁省分会会长李荒宣布大会开始。乐队高奏朝中两国国歌。沈阳市的少先队员向来自朝鲜的友人献了鲜花。
    中共辽宁省委第二书记、辽宁省省长黄欧东首先在会上讲话。他代表辽宁省人民，向光荣的朝鲜劳动党和英雄的朝鲜人民致热烈的节日的祝贺，并对朝中友好协会代表团全体贵宾表示热烈欢迎。
    黄欧东在讲话中阐述了十五年来朝鲜人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中所取得的辉煌成就，以及朝鲜人民在抗击美帝国主义斗争中所取得的伟大胜利。他说，朝鲜人民的胜利就是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的胜利，就是中国人民的胜利，我们把朝鲜人民勤劳勇敢、艰苦奋斗的精神，当成学习的榜样。
    黄欧东说：中朝两国人民有着深厚的传统友谊。我们的友谊是在反对我们共同敌人帝国主义的斗争中巩固和发展起来的，是两国人民的鲜血凝成的。近几年来，中朝两国人民的团结得到了进一步的增强和发展。
    黄欧东强调说，我们社会主义国家一向热爱和平。但是我们知道，要保卫和平，就必须坚持不懈地对帝国主义进行斗争。美帝国主义至今还赖在南朝鲜不走，破坏朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的斗争，并不断违反停战协定，制造战争威胁。他说：好战成性的美帝国主义是朝鲜人民的死敌，是亚洲人民的死敌，是全世界人民的死敌。我们必须看到美帝国主义的本性是永远不会改变的。只有同它进行坚决的斗争，才可能迫使它低下头来。对于美帝国主义决不能抱有不切实际的幻想。
    黄欧东最后说：目前形势对世界人民争取和平的斗争空前有利。在东风压倒西风的形势下，以美国为首的帝国主义的寿命不会长了，朝鲜人民实现祖国和平统一的日子也不会远了。我们坚信，有着三千里锦绣山河的朝鲜一定会实现统一，有着四千年悠久历史的朝鲜人民终将团聚在一起。
    朝中友好协会代表团团长金钟恒在热烈的掌声中讲话。他说：辽宁省同朝鲜只有一江之隔，朝中两国人民之间的经济文化交流和互相接触的友谊的道路贯通着辽宁省。辽宁和东北其他地区是朝中两国人民友谊史上永放光芒的革命战绩地，以金日成同志为首的朝鲜共产主义者们曾在这个地区同中国人民一道进行了历时十五年的英勇反日武装斗争。我们能够在这样有意义的场所和你们一起庆祝祖国的民族节日，感到无比的高兴。
    金钟恒说：朝中两国人民为反对共同的敌人美帝国主义而展开的斗争，更加清楚的显示了我们两国人民友好团结的不可战胜的威力。优秀的中国儿女在朝鲜锦绣江山上撒下的鲜血永远不会消失，他们表现的崇高的国际主义精神将永远铭刻在朝鲜人民的心里。在朝鲜人民战后恢复时期，中国人民又给予了我们莫大的物资和技术援助。最近，北京等中国各地人民对南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义斗争的声援，大大鼓舞了朝鲜人民为和平统一祖国而进行的斗争。没有任何力量能够破坏朝中两国人民这一传统的友好团结。
    金钟恒热情地祝贺中国人民在社会主义建设中取得的伟大成就以后，介绍了朝鲜解放十五年来工农业飞跃发展的情况。他说，今天朝鲜北半部人民过着幸福、繁荣的生活，正在沿着胜利的大道，跨上千里马向前飞驰。现在美帝国主义者仍然盘据在南朝鲜作威作福，横行霸道。如果美帝国主义者仍然不肯滚出南朝鲜和中国的台湾，继续进行挑衅，它们就注定要遭到比在朝鲜战争中更加惨重的失败。
    金钟恒最后说：朝鲜人民今后将尽自己的一切力量更加巩固朝中两国人民的友谊团结，和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，并且在维护远东和世界和平的斗争中永远同中国人民一起前进。
    他们的讲话不断引起热烈的掌声。
    参加今天的庆祝大会的，还有沈阳市副市长宋光、张磐新和中朝友好协会辽宁省分会秘书长、理事以及各民主党派地方组织、各人民团体的负责人。会后，放映了朝鲜影片“要爱未来”。
