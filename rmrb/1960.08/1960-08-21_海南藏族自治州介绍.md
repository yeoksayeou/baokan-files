Introduction to Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture

　　Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, south of Qinghai Lake, the largest inland lake in China. It governs five counties: Gonghe, Guide, Guinan, Xinghai, and Maduo. With the exception of Guide County, which mainly engages in agriculture, the other counties are primarily pastoral. It covers an area of over 52,000 square kilometers. It is inhabited by six ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Han, Hui, Tu, Mongolian, and Salar, with a population of over 200,000. In addition to the Qinghai-Tibet and Qinghai-Kang highways, which connect to Xining, Qaidam, and Goluo and Yushu, the counties are also accessible by car. The Yellow River flows from the Bayan Har Mountains in the southwest, through Maduo County, past Lakes Erling and Jialing to the east of Goluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and then circles back past the Ani Machen Mountains, passing through all the counties in the prefecture. The famous Longyang Gorge on the Yellow River is a deep, narrow gorge with a strategic location, making it an ideal site for a hydroelectric dam.

　　The prefecture is characterized by continuous mountains and lush grasslands, with vast pastures and fertile fields. Currently, the total sown area of crops in the prefecture has reached more than 1.7 million mu, which is more than seven times that of the early post-liberation period and more than double the amount in 1959, a year of major agricultural production growth. It will become a new agricultural production base in Qinghai Province. The underground mineral resources are also very rich. Preliminary exploration has already discovered more than 70 mineral sites, including more than 30 mineral types. In terms of animal husbandry, by the end of last year, the total number of livestock in the prefecture (excluding pigs) had increased by 1.8 times compared to the early post-liberation period. The prefecture's wool production accounts for about one-third of the total wool production in the province. The precious black fur pelts are soft, warm, curly, and beautiful, and have enjoyed a long-standing reputation both domestically and internationally. In addition, the area is extremely rich in various rare birds and animals, as well as wild plants.

　　Despite being such a rich and beautiful place, before liberation, the laboring people of all ethnic groups lived in inhuman and miserable conditions for a long time. The vast majority of land, grassland, and livestock were occupied by reactionary herdowners and headmen, while the laboring people, who accounted for more than 90% of the total population, only owned 15% of the livestock and a very small amount of land. Under the feudal rule of herdowners and headmen, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen was not high, and management was extremely backward, leading to a long-term stagnation and decline in animal husbandry production and a continuous deterioration in agricultural production. After liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, ethnic regional autonomous governments were established, a large number of ethnic cadres were trained, land reform was implemented in agricultural areas, and herders were organized to take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. In pastoral areas, a series of policies and measures were adopted to protect and develop animal husbandry production, which led to the rapid recovery and development of agricultural and animal husbandry production. In particular, after the socialist revolution in 1958 and the realization of communization in the vast pastoral areas, the feudal shackles were completely broken, the productive forces were liberated, and the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of herdsmen was unprecedentedly high, leading to the continuous emergence of high-yield records in animal husbandry production.

　　With the rapid development of production, the material and cultural life of the people has also improved significantly. The purchasing power of the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture, taking 1955 as 100, increased to 153 in 1957, 205 in 1958, and 289 in 1959. At present, while popularizing primary school education, the prefecture has also established various specialized schools, such as agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry, finance and economics, and ethnic normal schools. The number of students enrolled is more than ten times greater than before liberation. In terms of spare-time education, the prefecture has established more than 200 red and expert schools that combine politics, culture, and technology, as well as spare-time cultural schools at all levels, with more than 60% of young and middle-aged people having overcome illiteracy. A medical and health care network from the prefecture and county levels to the commune and production team levels has also been basically formed. Now, a prosperous scene of thriving population is appearing everywhere in the vast rural and pastoral areas.

    海南藏族自治州介绍
    海南藏族自治州地处黄河上游，在我国最大的内陆湖——青海湖以南地区，辖共和、贵德、贵南、兴海、玛多五个县。除贵德县主要经营农业外，其他几个县都以牧业为主。面积五万二千多平方公里。居住着藏、汉、回、土、蒙古、撒拉等六个民族，人口二十多万。境内除有青藏、青康两条公路可与西宁、柴达木以及果洛、玉树等地相连外，各县也可通行汽车。黄河从西南部的巴颜喀拉山，经玛多县，穿鄂陵、加陵两湖东去果洛藏族自治州，然后绕阿尼玛唧山折返，经过全州所有各县。著名的黄河龙羊峡，峡长万丈，形势险要，是理想的水电站坝址。
    自治州境内山岭连绵，绿草如茵，有着广阔的牧场和肥沃的良田。现在全州农作物播种面积已达一百七十多万亩，相当于解放初期的七倍多，比农业生产大发展的1959年增加了两倍多，将成为青海省一个新的农业生产基地。地下矿藏也十分丰富，经过初步的勘察，就已经发现包括三十多个矿种的七十多个矿点。在畜牧业方面，到去年年底，全州各类牲畜（不包括猪）已经比解放初期净增了一点八倍。全州羊毛产量约占全省羊毛总产量三分之一；名贵的黑裘皮，轻柔温暖，蜷曲美观，在国内外久负盛名。此外，各种珍禽异兽，野生动植物也极其丰富。
    自治州尽管是这样一个富饶、美丽的地方，但在解放前，各族劳动人民却长期过着非人的悲惨生活。极大部分的土地、草原和牲畜被反动的牧主和头人占有，而占总人口90％以上的劳动人民，只有15％的牲畜和极少量的土地，广大农牧民群众在牧主、头人的封建统治下，生产积极性不高，经营管理极端落后，致使畜牧业生产长期处于停滞和衰退状态，农业生产每况愈下。解放后，在中国共产党的领导下，成立了民族区域自治政权，培养了大批民族干部，在农业区实行了土地改革和组织牧民走互助合作的道路，在牧业区采取了一系列保护、发展畜牧业生产的政策、措施，使农牧业生产得到了迅速的恢复和发展。特别是广大牧业区在经过1958年的社会主义革命和一举实现公社化后，由于彻底摧垮了封建枷锁，解放了生产力，广大牧民的生产积极性空前高涨，畜牧业生产的高产纪录不断涌现。
    随着生产的飞跃发展，人民物质文化生活也有了显著提高。全州各族群众的购买力，如以1955年为一百，1957年增长到一百五十三，1958年为二百零五，1959年则为二百八十九。目前，全州在普及了小学教育的同时，还建立了农林、畜牧、财经、民族师范等各类专业学校，在校学生人数比解放前增加了十几倍。在业余教育方面，全州已办政治、文化、技术三结合的红专学校和各级业余文化学校二百多处，有60％以上的青壮年摆脱了文盲状态。一个从州、县到公社和生产队的医疗保健网也已经基本形成。现在，广大农村和牧区到处都出现了人丁兴旺的繁荣景象。
