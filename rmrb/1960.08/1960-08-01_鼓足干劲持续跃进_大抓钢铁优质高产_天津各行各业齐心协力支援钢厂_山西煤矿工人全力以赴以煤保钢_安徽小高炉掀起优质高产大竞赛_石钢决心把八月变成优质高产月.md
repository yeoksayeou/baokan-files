Tianjin
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 31st. All sectors in Tianjin, including industry, transportation, capital construction, and commerce, are working together to rapidly elevate steel production to a new level, ensuring the fulfillment and over-fulfillment of this year's steel production plan.

    Since the beginning of this year, Tianjin's steel production has demonstrated a continuous leap forward. From January to July, steel production more than doubled compared to the same period last year. Quality has also significantly improved, and consumption has noticeably decreased. However, the steel production task for the next five months remains arduous. To this end, the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee recently conducted a special study of the city's steel production situation, established a Steel Command Headquarters, and decided to adopt various practical and effective measures centered on increasing furnace utilization rates and boosting furnace output, to guarantee a substantial increase in steel production. First, swiftly implement new measures to expand production capacity. Since April, Tianjin's four steel plants have successively put into operation two batches of new measures focused on expanding production capacity. These two batches of measures mainly included the construction of fourteen new hot-blast stoves and dedicated equipment to increase air volume, totaling over 1,500 pieces. Recently, a third batch of measures was arranged, which will be put into production successively in August and September. Currently, all steel plants are conducting comprehensive inspections of the measures already put into production. Those functioning normally will continue to be used, while those not functioning normally are fully mobilizing the masses to quickly overcome technical barriers, ensuring normal use to guarantee a rapid and substantial increase in steel production. Second, improve leadership style and strengthen enterprise management. Leading cadres in all steel plants are going deep into the front lines of production, eating, living, laboring, and consulting with workers, resolving specific problems in a down-to-earth manner. At the same time, various responsibility systems, enterprise management systems, and production command systems for steel plants, workshops, and teams are being further established and improved. Steel plants are also adopting a working method of grasping current production on one hand and strengthening preparatory work on the other, to ensure organic connections and rhythmic coordination between production and preparation. Third, vigorously strengthen technical support, raw material supply, and transportation. Steel plants have begun to establish specialized technical institutions for equipment maintenance and raw material processing to strengthen and expand mechanical repair capabilities. Tianjin is also preparing to establish a strong material supply base to meet the needs of increased steel production. Fourth, fully leverage the smelting capabilities of small blast furnaces, small converters, and small electric furnaces in various factories and enterprises to increase steel production. The Tianjin Municipal Party Committee has decided to fully utilize the 1.5-ton and 3-ton small electric furnaces, small converters, and steel casting open-hearth furnaces in over a dozen units, such as the Tianjin New Port Shipyard, Xinhe Shipyard, Tianjin Tractor Factory, and Steel Casting Factory, for steelmaking production. In the past, these factories' small electric furnaces and small converters only undertook the casting and forging tasks of their own factories. This time, after participating in steelmaking, the district committees are also preparing to transfer corresponding technical personnel, labor, and technical equipment to support these factories in steelmaking.

    In the movement of mobilizing the entire Party and making every effort to secure steel production, all districts in the city, led by the district party secretaries, have formed steel protection leading groups composed of leading cadres to specifically arrange steel protection tasks. At the same time, ideological education on supporting steel production is being universally conducted among employees in all sectors. A conscious and all-out upsurge of support for steel plant production has emerged throughout the city, with all sectors leaving difficulties to themselves and making convenience for steel plants. Since late July alone, statistics from 71 units in Hexi District show that over 2,100 people have been mobilized to rush-process over 1,200 steel ingot molds and clean up over 1,000 tons of accumulated materials for the Third Steel Plant. All units undertaking the production of steel protection equipment are completing tasks on time, with guaranteed quality and quantity, without haggling over prices or considering conditions. Workers in the machinery industry have launched three upsurges of crash work in the process of rushing to manufacture steel protection equipment, completing tasks on schedule. The four dolomite calcination furnaces newly built by the Second Steel Plant to improve the quality of oil bricks were fully supported by more than 20 units, including the Boiler Factory, Bicycle Factory, and Paper Installation Company, and were all completed and put into production in just ten days, ensuring the need for a substantial increase in the plant's steel production. Six work units of the Third Steel Plant operate in the open air. In order to ensure that the factory's production is not affected during the rainy season, the construction system successively transferred more than 150 workers to rush-build six simple factory buildings. The transportation department transferred more than 100 trucks and horse-drawn carts specifically to transport raw materials such as pig iron, ore, and coke for the steel plants. In order to ensure that steel warriors eat well, rest well, and have sufficient energy, employees in the commercial sector are continuously sending large quantities of cooling oil, Rendan, fresh fish, fruits, mosquito nets, and other daily necessities to various steel plants. Some hospitals with special relationships with steel plants have transferred excellent doctors and nurses to form medical teams, establishing clinics in the steel plants and stationed in the factories.

    In the all-Party and all-people upsurge of securing steel production, the fighting spirit of the vast number of workers on the steel front to seize steel production has been further stimulated. In late July, a targeted competition movement of seizing steel and achieving high production was launched, directly promoting a substantial increase in steel production. Steel production in late July increased by 27.8% compared to mid-July, and the qualified rate of steel ingots also increased compared to mid-July.

Shanxi
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 31st. Shanxi Province's coal industry departments are taking various measures to strive for a high-speed increase in coal production in August, supplying key steel enterprises with more coal.

    The coal produced by Shanxi Province's state-owned coal mines supplies many key industrial enterprises across the country, including Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, Chongqing Iron and Steel Corporation, Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Corporation, Baotou Steel, Taiyuan Iron and Steel, and Shanghai Iron and Steel. Shanxi Province's state-owned coal mines have formulated an August plan. They propose to go all out to increase coal production, ensuring the coal needs of these key steel enterprises for large-scale production increases in August.

    Various mines are doing everything possible to tap internal manpower to strengthen the tunneling front. The Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau has extracted more than 700 people from the consolidation of labor organizations to serve as tunneling workers. The Fenxi Mining Bureau has also adjusted more than 1,000 people from auxiliary workers to strengthen tunneling forces. Recently, in accordance with the principle of "front line first, rear service later," coal mines across the province have extracted another 6,000 people from the streamlining of government offices, organized them into tunneling teams, and strengthened roadway tunneling and new working face development. While these personnel are going down the well, the Shanxi Provincial Coal Mine Administration and various mining bureaus and mines are mobilizing the masses to clean up warehouses, search for, manufacture, and repair the equipment needed for new working faces. At present, various mines have successively equipped more than 150 new coal chutes, more than 300 electric drills, and a large number of mine cars. By July 29, the 27 newly developed coal mining working faces have been fully equipped and handed over to coal miners for production. These new working faces can increase coal production by 12,000 tons per day.

    The basic construction departments of Shanxi Province's coal industry, according to the instructions of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, have also recently extracted manpower from some projects that cannot be put into production or benefit this year to strengthen the production front. In the past few days, nearly 10,000 people from the basic construction units of the Fenxi, Luan, Datong, and Taiyuan Xishan mining bureaus have taken electric drills, fans, and tools to participate in the work of coal mining and tunneling working faces.

    In order to command the coal seizing battle in August more effectively, leading cadres of various bureaus and mines have been decentralized at all levels. Deputy party secretaries and deputy directors of various mining bureaus have gone to the mines to serve as party secretaries and mine directors. Deputy party secretaries and deputy mine directors of the mines have gone to the pit mouths to serve as branch secretaries. The Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau has abolished the coal mining team-level organization, allowing more than 60 full-time coal mining team leaders—old coal miners—to return to the coal mining areas as team leaders. At present, the preparations of coal miners across the province to seize a large increase in coal production in August have been completed.

Anhui
    According to Anhui Daily, the vast number of employees on the steel front in Anhui Province are enthusiastically participating in a large-scale competition for high quality and high production. The steel plants participating in the competition are launching a new high tide of production centered on improving the quality of steel, ensuring the early and over-fulfillment of the steel production tasks for the third quarter.

    This large-scale competition for high quality and high production in steel was initiated by steel workers in Hefei. The Hefei Iron and Steel General Plant held a city-wide mobilization meeting for the metallurgical system on July 16, where more than 800 employee representatives from ironmaking, steelmaking, coking, steel rolling, and other fields unanimously passed a proposal to launch a competition initiative to all small blast furnace ironmaking employees in the province. The competition conditions they proposed are: First, ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the pig iron production plans for July and the third quarter; Second, the average blast furnace utilization coefficient should reach 2.5 or above; Third, the coke ratio per furnace of pig iron should be reduced to below 0.9; Fourth, immediately launch an offensive campaign centered on improving the quality of pig iron, overcome high temperatures, seize high quality and high production, and achieve a qualified rate of pig iron of 95% or more (calculated according to the new standards issued by the ministry) within fifteen days, of which first-class products account for 80% or more.

    Hefei's competition initiative quickly received enthusiastic responses from steel workers throughout the province. After discussing the competition conditions proposed by the Hefei Iron and Steel General Plant, employees of various ironmaking plants in Ma'anshan, Wuhu Iron and Steel General Plant, Huainan Dongfeng Iron Plant, Anqing Iron and Steel Plant, and Bengbu Iron and Steel General Plant all greatly boosted their energy and formulated their own conditions and measures to strive for high quality and high production. In order to achieve high quality and high production in the third quarter, 80% of the cadres of Huainan Dongfeng Iron Plant have gone to the furnace front to settle down, effectively strengthening the leadership of the front line of production. Leading cadres of various ironmaking plants in Ma'anshan are also determined to spend more than 70% of their time going deep into the front line of production, solving key production problems in a down-to-earth manner, and promoting a comprehensive leap forward in output and quality.

Shigang
    According to Xinhua News Agency, employees of the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company are determined to turn the hot and rainy August into a month of high quality and high production, ensuring that the qualified rate of steel and iron reaches 99% or more.

    At present, employees of the limestone mine, ironmaking plant, transportation department, and other departments of the steel company are enthusiastically carrying out a one-stop competition, and are also collaborating extensively with employees of the railway bureau outside the plant to accelerate the allocation of vehicles and rush-transport limestone. The company has also tried every means to expand its hydro-beneficiation capacity, ensuring that the blast furnace also receives "fine grain" during the rainy season. The power department and safety technology department and other units have organized a major safety inspection and re-revised the equipment regulations and systems, providing good conditions for safe production in August.

    Various production plants and mines have also prepared materials for the rainy season based on the specific conditions of their units. The experimental plant built four lime kilns to independently calcine lime. The ironmaking plant timely revised the batching system in response to changes in the amount of raw materials used during the rainy season, and organized screening forces to carry out ore crushing and processing. The sintering plant is also conducting various ore sintering tests to ensure a sufficient supply of blast furnace sinter.
