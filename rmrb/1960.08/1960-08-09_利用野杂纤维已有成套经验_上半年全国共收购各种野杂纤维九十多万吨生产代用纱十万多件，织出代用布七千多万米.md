Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: Many regions across the country have created a wealth of experience in better utilizing all available wild and miscellaneous fibers for spinning and weaving. This experience has essentially become comprehensive and standardized, paving a broad path for the continued and larger-scale utilization of China's extremely rich wild and miscellaneous fiber resources in the future.

According to preliminary investigations, over 100 types of wild and miscellaneous fibers suitable for textile production have been discovered in China. Cotton stalk bark alone has an annual yield of over 10 million dan (a unit of weight), and there are also substantial resources of flax, Apocynum venetum, stinging nettle, and others. In the first half of this year, after various regions further recognized the important significance of developing wild fibers for the development of the textile industry, they more actively launched the "Minor Spring Harvest" and "Minor Summer Harvest" campaigns, vigorously carrying out the collection, acquisition, and processing of wild fibers. As of the end of June, the nation had acquired over 900,000 tons of various wild and miscellaneous fibers, produced over 100,000 pieces of substitute yarn, and woven over 70 million meters of substitute cloth. Furthermore, over 20 million burlap sacks were blended with wild and miscellaneous fibers. Various regions used these substitute cloths for packaging, work uniforms, protective gear, curtains, tablecloths, sofa covers, and more, saving a large quantity of cotton cloth.

During the collection process of wild and miscellaneous fiber raw materials, many regions closely focused on the central tasks of the rural areas at various stages, adhering to the principle of "minor efforts during busy times, major efforts during less busy times, suspension during extremely busy times, and concentrated efforts during seasonal surges." They appropriately organized and arranged labor, adopting a combination of regular and concentrated methods for collection and acquisition, achieving significant results. The commercial departments of Linshui County, Sichuan Province, helped the communes arrange a basic team for wild fiber harvesting and processing, while also mobilizing each commune member to "carry a knife up the mountain and bring back a load when returning home" during daily production, harvesting whenever they had spare time, without affecting agricultural production. In the first half of this year, the county collected over 200,090 dan of various wild fiber raw materials, significantly exceeding the collection volume of the same period last year.

Many wild plants must be peeled after collection to be used as fiber raw materials, especially cotton stalk bark, where peeling is the most arduous task. In the past, many regions were affected in the utilization of this resource because the peeling problem was not resolved. Currently, on the one hand, various regions have created and successfully trial-produced many indigenous and foreign wild and miscellaneous fiber peeling machines to save manpower and improve efficiency. On the other hand, they have tightly grasped the opportunity when wild fibers are freshly harvested, launching short-term mass movements to peel them while fresh, achieving immediate results.

The quality of degumming wild and miscellaneous fibers not only affects the utilization and use value of these fibers but also affects the textile process and the quality of textiles. Currently, the degumming methods adopted by various regions generally fall into three categories: chemical degumming, bacterial degumming (i.e., natural degumming), and mechanical treatment degumming. These degumming methods each have their advantages, and various regions have adopted degumming methods suitable for their local conditions.

The final step in utilizing wild and miscellaneous fibers is spinning and weaving. In the first half of this year, various regions continued to implement the policy of adapting to local conditions, using both indigenous and foreign methods, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, extensively utilizing wild and miscellaneous fibers for textile production. Currently, 19 provinces and cities across the country are using wild and miscellaneous fibers for spinning and weaving in modern enterprises. Shanghai, the most developed city in the textile industry, allocated 100,000 spindles and 1,000 looms to the production of wild fiber products. In the past few months, it has produced 20 types of blended cotton yarn ranging from one to eighty counts, and woven over 80 types of substitute cloth, including plain cloth, coarse canvas, denim, and upholstery fabric. Modern jute textile enterprises across the country have generally mixed 50% raw cotton stalk bark into the weft yarn of burlap sacks. Shijiazhuang Huaxin Textile Factory has used 70% cotton stalk bark and waste cotton and cotton waste to blend and spin packaging cloth ranging from three to six counts. Xinqin Textile Factory in Shaanxi Province has also trial-produced six-count packaging cloth using 80% cotton stalk bark. Other regions are also continuously increasing the blending ratio.

While utilizing wild and miscellaneous fibers for spinning and weaving, in order to enable "hundreds of herbs" to better serve industrial and agricultural production and the people's lives, various regions have also launched mass comprehensive utilization movements. Many wild and miscellaneous fibers with very low use value, after comprehensive utilization, have turned the useless into the useful and made one use into multiple uses. Many regions have extracted tannin, furfural, lignin, pigments, pulp, and other products from wild fibers, which not only increased industrial raw materials but also supported agriculture.

### 利用野杂纤维已有成套经验  上半年全国共收购各种野杂纤维九十多万吨生产代用纱十万多件，织出代用布七千多万米

    利用野杂纤维已有成套经验
    上半年全国共收购各种野杂纤维九十多万吨生产代用纱十万多件，织出代用布七千多万米
    据新华社8日讯　全国许多地区已经创造出丰富的经验，来更好地利用一切可以利用的野杂纤维纺纱织布，这些经验已经基本上成龙配套，为今后继续更大规模地利用我国极为丰富的野杂纤维资源开辟了广阔的道路。
    据初步调查，目前我国已经发现可供纺织的野杂纤维就有一百多种，仅棉秆皮一项年产量即达一千万担以上，还有胡麻、罗布麻、螫麻等大量资源。今年上半年，各地进一步认识了发展野生纤维对于发展纺织工业的重要意义以后，更加积极地开展了“小春收”、“小夏收”运动，大搞野生纤维的采集收购和加工工作。截至6月底，全国已收购各种野杂纤维九十多万吨，生产代用纱十万多件，织出代用布七千多万米，并且用野杂纤维混纺麻袋二千多万条；各地用这些代用布做包装布、工作服、防护用品、窗帘、台布、沙发套等等，节约了大批棉布。
    在野杂纤维原料的采集过程中，许多地区紧密围绕农村各个时期的中心工作，本着“大忙小搞，小忙大搞，特忙暂停，季节突击”的原则，适时地组织和安排劳动力，采取经常与突击相结合的办法进行采集和收购，取得了很大成绩。四川省邻水县商业部门帮助公社在不影响农业生产的前提下，除开安排了一部分人员作为野生纤维采摘加工的基本队伍以外，在日常生产中，发动每个社员“上山带把刀，回家挑一挑”，有空就采。今年上半年全县采集各种野生纤维原料达二十万零九千多担，大大超过了去年同期的采集量。
    许多野生植物采集下来后，必须剥皮才能作纤维原料，特别是棉秆皮剥皮任务最为繁重。过去不少地区由于剥皮问题没有解决，影响了这种资源的利用。目前各地一方面创造和试制成功了很多土的或洋的野杂纤维剥皮机，以节约人力提高效率；另一方面紧紧抓住野生纤维刚刚采摘下来的时机，开展短期的趁鲜剥皮的群众运动，取得了立竿见影的效果。
    野杂纤维脱胶的好坏，不仅影响到这些纤维的利用和使用价值，而且影响到纺织工艺过程和纺织品的质量。目前各地采取的脱胶办法大体有三类：一类是化学脱胶，一类是细菌脱胶（即自然脱胶），一类是机械处理脱胶。这些脱胶办法各有优点，各地因地制宜地采用了适合于本地区条件的脱胶方法。
    利用野杂纤维的最后一个步骤就是纺纱织布。今年上半年，各地继续贯彻因地制宜，土洋并举，土洋结合的方针，大量利用野杂纤维进行纺织。目前全国已有十九个省市在现代化的企业中用野杂纤维纺纱织布。纺织工业最发达的上海市拨出了十万纱锭、一千台织机投入野生纤维制品的生产，几个月来已生产出了一支到八十支共二十种混纺棉纱，织出了平布、粗帆布、劳动布、沙发布等八十多种代用布。全国现代化的麻纺企业已普遍在麻袋纬纱中混用50％的生棉秆皮。石家庄华新纺织厂用70％的棉秆皮和古棉、下脚花混纺出了三支到六支纱的包装布。陕西省新秦纺织厂也用80％的棉秆皮试制出六支纱的包装布。其他各地也都在不断提高混纺的比例。
    在利用野杂纤维纺纱织布的同时，为了叫“百草”更多地为工农业生产，为人民生活服务，各地还开展群众性的综合利用运动，许多使用价值很低的野杂纤维，经过综合利用，把无用变成有用，一用变多用。许多地区从野生纤维中提取出了栲胶、糠醛、木质素、色素、纸浆等多种产品，既增加了工业原料又支援了农业。
