Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang. People's commune members in the flood-stricken areas of Liaoning are now making every effort to restore production under the leadership of the Party.

The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and various municipal Party committees have organized慰问团 (comfort groups), led by secretaries, to go deep into the disaster areas to express sympathy and help solve various problems in post-disaster recovery and life arrangements in a timely manner. The Anshan Municipal Party Committee also transferred more than 400 cadres at the section chief level and above from agencies, factories, mines, and schools to the rural disaster areas on the outskirts of Liaoyang City to strengthen leadership over production and participate in replanting late-autumn crops. To meet the needs of post-disaster recovery, the Ministry of Grain specially allocated a batch of late-autumn crops such as buckwheat, radish, and vegetable seeds to Liaoning Province; the commercial departments of Liaoning Province also purchased a batch of vegetable seeds from various places to support the expansion of autumn vegetable planting in the disaster areas.

With the care and support of the Party and the state, the people in the disaster areas are in high spirits. As soon as the rain stopped and the flood receded, they immediately devoted themselves to a production campaign centered on draining water to save seedlings, rushing to harvest and replant, and developing diversified operations under the slogan of "Drain every patch, save every plant, strive to turn severe disasters into minor disasters, and ensure a bumper harvest in minor disasters." In the rural disaster areas of Liaoyang City, more than 30,000 people are now dispatched every day to concentrate their efforts on replanting autumn vegetables and late-autumn crops. On the second day after the flood subsided, the Lanjiatun Commune dispatched more than 6,000 people to drain water and replant, and has now replanted more than 10,000 mu of late-autumn crops. The Anping People's Commune, which was severely affected by the disaster, is full of confidence and enthusiasm for overcoming the disaster. They said: "The Party is our backing, and the people's commune is our guarantee. With the leadership of the Party, giving full play to the superiority of the people's commune, plus our hard bones, we can overcome any disaster!" After the disaster, they resettled the disaster victims and reorganized the labor organization to restore production. On the 11th alone, they replanted more than 1,900 mu of vegetables and late-autumn crops.

The restoration of production in the disaster areas has received strong support from the people in the non-disaster areas. More than 30 non-disaster production teams of the Dengta People's Commune in Liaoyang dispatched more than 3,500 people and more than 120 large carts to help brother teams in the disaster areas replant late-autumn crops.

    排出一块是一块　救出一棵是一棵
    辽宁大力排水抢种
    新华社沈阳讯　辽宁遭受水灾地区的人民公社社员，现在正在党的领导下全力恢复生产。
    中共辽宁省委和各市委都由书记挂帅组织了慰问团，深入灾区进行慰问，及时帮助解决灾后恢复生产和安排生活中的各种问题。中共鞍山市委还从机关、厂矿、学校中抽调了四百多名科长级以上干部，深入辽阳市郊灾区农村，一面加强对生产的领导，一面参加抢种晚秋作物。为了解决灾后恢复生产的需要，中央粮食部特地拨给辽宁省一批荞麦、萝卜等晚秋作物和蔬菜种籽；辽宁省商业部门也从各地采购了一批菜籽，支援灾区扩种秋菜。
    灾区人民在党和国家的关怀和支援下，斗志昂扬，暴雨一停和洪水一退，便在“排出一块是一块，救出一棵是一棵，力争重灾变轻灾，轻灾保丰收”的口号下，全力投入了以排水救苗、抢收抢种、开展多种经营为中心的生产运动。辽阳市灾区农村，现在每天出动三万多人，集中力量抢种秋菜和晚秋作物。蓝家公社在洪水消退的第二天，就出动六千多人，边排水边抢种，现已改种晚秋作物一万多亩。受灾较重的安平人民公社，社员们战胜灾害的信心和干劲十足，他们说：“党是靠山，人民公社是保证，有党的领导，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，再加上我们这把硬骨头，天大的灾害我们也能战胜！”灾后，他们一面安置灾民生活，一面重新整顿了劳动组织，恢复生产，11日一天就抢种蔬菜和晚秋作物一千九百多亩。
    灾区人民的恢复生产，得到了广大非灾区人民的大力支援。辽阳灯塔人民公社三十多个非灾区生产队，为了支援灾区的兄弟队，出动了三千五百多人和一百二十多台大车，帮助抢种晚秋作物。
