Xinhua News Agency, 19th: People in Uruguay, Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, and other countries held strikes, rallies, and demonstrations to support the Cuban Revolution and oppose the U.S. plot to interfere in Cuba at the San Jose Inter-American Foreign Ministers' Conference.

More than 200,000 industrial workers and 40,000 university and middle school students in Uruguay held a nationwide 24-hour general strike and class boycott on the 18th. The decision of the United Labor Movement of Uruguay and the University Student Federation regarding the general strike stated that the strike was held to express "active support for the Cuban people and their revolutionary goals," and also to demand increased wages, trade union rights, and other labor rights. The general strike paralyzed the port of Montevideo and the entire country.

University students in the Peruvian capital held a rally at Trujillo University on the evening of the 17th, expressing their firm support for the Cuban Revolution and opposition to the interventionist plots of U.S. imperialism.

Speakers at the meeting severely condemned the United States' attempt to use the Organization of American States to plot interference in Cuba, and opposed the behavior of suggesting convening the Inter-American Foreign Ministers' Conference at the instigation of the United States.

When the rallying masses wanted to leave the school to hold a demonstration, they were met with violent suppression by the police. The masses resisted the police's brutality and threw stones from the windows and rooftops of the university buildings at the Peruvian-American Cultural Association located across from the university.

Demonstrations in support of Cuba continued throughout Venezuela. In Caracas, the capital, some members of the National Women's Federation of Venezuela held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Venezuela at noon on the 18th, holding placards supporting the Cuban Revolution and opposing U.S. imperialist interference. In Cumana, the capital of Sucre State in the east, and in Maracaibo and other places, hundreds of people held demonstrations, waving banners and flags in support of Cuba, expressing their opposition to U.S. interference in Cuba.

In Guayaquil, Ecuador's second-largest city, young people also organized rallies and demonstrations in support of Cuba on the evening of the 15th. Speakers at the meeting denounced the aggressive policies of the United States.

According to Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Mass organizations and public opinion in Chile, Costa Rica, Argentina, and other countries have condemned the United States' attempt to strangle the Cuban Revolution through the Inter-American Foreign Ministers' Conference and expressed firm support for Cuba.

The Chilean National Movement for Support and Defense of the Cuban Revolution issued a statement on the 16th, condemning the interventionist plots against Cuba carried out at the Inter-American Foreign Ministers' Conference, and calling on the people of Chile to closely unite with the Cuban people to defend the Cuban Revolution.

The statement pointed out that the Inter-American Foreign Ministers' Conference included the so-called threats to the Pan-American system and interference by forces outside the continent, fabricated by the United States, on the agenda, with the aim of concealing the attack on the Cuban Revolution. The statement said, "Some people are attempting to replay the Guatemala incident in Cuba with the support of the most reactionary forces on the Latin American continent. They are trying to condemn the most profound and sublime revolution that has occurred in the Americas so far. They are trying to prevent the voices of the poor masses and working people of Cuba from penetrating the hearts of the Latin American people who yearn for justice and freedom. Foreign capitalists, large estate owners, bankers, and upper-level Catholics are desperately stirring up trouble, attempting to besiege Cuba and push it back to an era of plunder, massacre, and brutal exploitation. These insidious guys are pinning their hopes on the San Jose Conference."

The statement went on to point out that the Cuban Revolution is indestructible. Six million Cuban people have engraved the slogan "Defend the motherland to the death" in their hearts, and tens of millions of Latin American workers are turning this slogan into their own. The whole world is admiringly watching Cuba's glorious struggle against a major power with nuclear weapons. Victory will surely belong to Cuba.

The Chilean "Siglo" newspaper published an article on the 16th, condemning the United States for plotting aggression against Cuba at the San Jose Inter-American Foreign Ministers' Conference. "Siglo" pointed out that the Organization of American States has never done anything beneficial to the people of Latin America. On the contrary, as a docile tool of imperialism, the Organization of American States is an insult to the people of our countries.

The National Conference of Communist Party City Councilors of Chile, which closed in Santiago on the 15th, made a decision to oppose imperialist aggression against Cuba.

In San Jose, the site of the Inter-American Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Costa Rican Women's League issued a statement on the 16th, expressing support for Cuba. The statement said that Cuba is the heart, hope, and faith of the Americas. Cuba has shattered its chains and is liberating its economy and increasing its wealth. It has handed over land to the peasants, exercised national sovereignty, and is fighting for its own independence. It has frustrated foreign interest groups that oppose it. (Attached picture)

    声明指出，美洲外长会议把美国所捏造的所谓对泛美体系的威胁和大陆以外的势力的干涉问题列入议程，目的在于掩饰对古巴革命的进攻。声明说，“有人企图在拉丁美洲大陆最反动的力量的支持下在古巴重演危地马拉事件。他们企图谴责直到现在为止美洲所发生的最深刻、最崇高的革命。他们企图阻止古巴贫苦大众和劳动群众的声音深入到渴望正义和自由的拉丁美洲人民的心里。外国资本家、大庄园主、银行家和天主教上层人物绝望地蠢动起来，企图包围古巴，使古巴后退到遭受掠夺、屠杀和残酷剥削的时代。这些阴险的家伙把他们的希望寄托在圣约瑟会议上。”
    声明接着指出，但是古巴革命是不可摧毁的。六百万古巴人民已经把“誓死保卫祖国”的口号铭刻在自己的心头，拉丁美洲几千万劳动者正在把这个口号变成他们自己的口号，全世界都钦佩地注视着古巴对一个拥有核武器的大国所进行的光荣的斗争。胜利必将属于古巴。
    智利“世纪报”16日发表文章，谴责美国在圣约瑟美洲外长会议上策划对古巴的侵略。“世纪报”指出，美洲国家组织从来没有做出任何对拉丁美洲人民有益的事情，恰恰相反，作为帝国主义驯服工具的美洲国家组织对于我们这些国家的人民来说是一种侮辱。
