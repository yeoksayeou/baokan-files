    High Quality and High Yield - Every Second Counts
    The Party has issued a great call to launch an increase production and practice economy campaign centered on grain and steel. The people of the whole country have responded positively, and we, the workers directly involved in steel production, are even more confident. In order to ensure the completion of this year's pig iron production task, our Wuhan Iron and Steel Works has made a detailed study of the work from now until the end of the year, and has determined the monthly production increase plan for each blast furnace. The masses of workers have thoroughly investigated the favorable conditions for completing the task and the key issues that need to be resolved, and are confident and determined to complete the task.
    To ensure high quality and high yield, we must continue to conscientiously implement the Party's policy of running enterprises by relying on the masses, and implement the new technical line. In my work, I must take the lead in implementing it, first of all by breaking down superstition and liberating my mind. Implementing the new technical line requires a lot of work, such as charging, tapping, slag and iron ladle supply, and furnace operation, all of which must adapt to the new needs. Therefore, I am also determined to further delve into the work in the future, go directly to each post, and solve the problems that arise in the work together with everyone, especially to rely on the masses to solve the technical problems in the implementation of the new technical line, and help workers and groups achieve the Party's requirements for completing the plan in every shift, ensuring high pig iron production, and completing and over fulfilling the task.
    Li Feng'en, Deputy Director of Wuhan Iron and Steel Works

    优质高产  分秒必争
    党发出了开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的伟大号召，全国人民都积极响应，我们直接参加钢铁生产的职工，更是信心百倍。为了确保完成今年生铁生产任务，我们武钢炼铁厂已经把从现在到年底的工作做了详细研究，确定了每月每座高炉的增产计划，职工群众大查完成任务的有利条件和需要解决的关键问题，有信心有决心完成任务。
    要确保优质高产，必须继续认真贯彻党的依靠群众办企业的方针，贯彻新的技术路线。在工作中我要带头执行，首先是破除迷信，解放思想。贯彻新的技术路线，要作好许多工作，如装料、铁口、渣铁罐的供应、炉内操作，都要适应新的需要。因此，我还决心在今后进一步深入工作，直接到各个岗位上，和大家一道解决工作中出现的问题，特别是要依靠群众，解决贯彻新技术路线中的技术问题，帮助工人、小组实现党所要求的班班完成计划，保证生铁高产，完成和超额完成任务。
    武钢炼铁厂副厂长　李凤恩
