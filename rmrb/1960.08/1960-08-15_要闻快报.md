Xinjiang Vigorously Manages Autumn Fields
By August 5th, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region had generally cultivated its autumn fields two to three times. Approximately 30% had been watered for the second time and had the second application of fertilizer completed. The growth of various crops is in good condition.

In field management, all regions are focusing on backward areas and low-yield fields, managing both grain and cash crops simultaneously.

Guizhou Expands Planting of Late Autumn Crops
Since late July, Guizhou Province has been actively sowing late autumn crops while vigorously managing existing fields. In just over half a month, the province has planted more than one million mu.

Currently, in the work of seizing the time to plant more late autumn crops, Guizhou Province is mainly focusing on ideological mobilization and labor arrangement. Many communes have mobilized members to carefully calculate the benefits of planting more, leading to increased production, and have organized veteran farmers to summarize past experiences of high-yield late autumn crops.

Henan Massively Cultivates Chlorella
Various areas in Henan Province are taking advantage of the current favorable conditions to massively cultivate chlorella. Incomplete statistics from only 67 counties and cities including Linru, Wuyang, Xinzheng, Huojia, Xunxian, Shangshui, and Mixian show that since June, more than 89.6 million jin of concentrated chlorella liquid and more than 3,190 jin of dried powder have been produced.

Heilongjiang Province Rushes to Harvest Flax
People's communes planting flax in Heilongjiang Province are making a concentrated effort to rush the flax harvest. Currently, more than 200,000 mu have been pulled across the province.

The flax planted in Heilongjiang Province this year is generally growing very well due to the conscientious implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. The fiber quality exceeds any previous year, generally at the third grade or above.

Based on the characteristics of this year's flax – high density, tall stalks, large labor requirements, harvest season coinciding with the rainy season, and progressing alongside wheat harvesting and field management of major autumn crops – Heilongjiang Province has adopted the method of harvesting one area after another as it ripens, one mu after another, to ensure timely harvesting.

Jilin Launches the "Three Plantings" Movement
Various areas in Jilin Province have launched a "Three Plantings" movement of rushing to plant autumn vegetables, late-season crops, and fodder crops. As of the 5th, the area of the "Three Plantings" across the province has reached more than 4,395,000 mu, an increase of 34.4% compared to the same period last year. Early-planted vegetables have emerged and are developing leaves, and some areas have begun thinning seedlings and weeding and applying fertilizer. Currently, all regions are concentrating manpower and animal power to continue rushing to plant.

Zhangye Prefecture Rushes to Irrigate with Floodwater
The Zhangye Prefecture in Gansu is organizing the broad masses of people to take advantage of the excellent opportunity to rush to irrigate with floodwater. Recently, the counties and cities of Shandan, Yongchang, Wuwei, Tianzhu, Gaotai, Yumen, and Zhangye, which have experienced floods, have jointly rushed to irrigate 720,000 mu of summer and autumn fields and planted over 40,000 mu of small and short-season crops using floodwater irrigation.

Based on the characteristics of rapid and short-duration floods, all regions have adopted a combination of irrigation and water storage, irrigating while storing water. While diverting floodwater for irrigation, Gaotai County reservoirs such as Baojia Lake and Mawei Lake stored a total of 670,000 cubic meters of floodwater. Zhangye City stored 2.56 million cubic meters.
