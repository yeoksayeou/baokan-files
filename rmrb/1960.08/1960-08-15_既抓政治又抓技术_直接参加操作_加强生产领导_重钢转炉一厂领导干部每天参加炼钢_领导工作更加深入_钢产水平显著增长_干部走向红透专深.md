Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 14th: The leading cadres of Chongqing Steel Company's Converter Plant No. 1 are currently engaged in a very meaningful activity: each person goes to the furnace every day to directly participate in operations, participate in command, and work with workers to produce a heat of qualified steel. All party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League leaders of the entire plant are participating in this activity. Through practical operation, they closely combine politics and technology, and study technology diligently in a more planned and organized manner, accelerating the process of cadres becoming both "red" and expert. This activity makes leadership work more meticulous and down-to-earth, thereby better promoting the double harvest of high-yield and high-quality converter steel. According to the plant's statistics from August 1st to 9th, after the above-mentioned activities were launched, the plant's steel production level increased more significantly, and the daily steel production level increased by 76% compared with the same period last month, and the qualification rate increased by 9.4%.

    The activity of "each leader smelting a heat of qualified steel every day" in this plant is based on the implementation of eating, living, working, and consulting with workers, and is closely focused on the current key to production. The plant's Party committee recently summarized the experience of the previous stage of leading cadres going to the front line to lead production and adhering to eating, living, working, and consulting with workers. The plant's Party committee pointed out that in the past, leading cadres went to the front line and made great achievements in strengthening political and ideological work, further enhancing the relationship between leaders and the masses, and improving furnace equipment and technical operations. However, due to insufficient familiarity with production technology, production was not deeply understood, and some specific problems in production were not grasped deeply enough, especially the failure to grasp the entire process of converter steelmaking, from batching, iron melting in the cupola, to converter blowing and pouring, one link after another. This requires leading cadres to grasp both politics and technology, and gain more technical experience through direct participation in steelmaking, in order to better target the key to production, dissect "sparrows," establish "models," and strengthen leadership over production. In view of this, the plant's Party committee decided to launch an activity of "each leader smelting a heat of qualified steel every day" throughout the plant. This decision was enthusiastically supported by all cadres in the plant. The secretary and deputy secretaries of the plant's Party committee, the director and deputy directors of the plant, the chairman of the labor union, the secretary of the Communist Youth League, and the secretaries of each shift branch all quickly invested in the activity of smelting qualified steel.

    This activity has enabled the plant's leading cadres to better combine specific participation in production with leading production, and has more effectively promoted production. They generally reflected that after personally participating in the operation of the entire smelting process, they had a better understanding of the smelting technology, and their skills were higher and their methods were more numerous. Hu Ziqiang, the secretary of the Party committee, was originally a fitter and was not familiar with smelting technology. In the past, wherever he went, he could only familiarize himself with the production there, and it was difficult to specifically direct the entire smelting process. This time, he took the lead and humbly learned from the masses. He not only quickly mastered the technology of operating converter steelmaking, but also further understood the knack of smelting qualified steel with high-sulfur iron. Yin Zixin, the secretary of the First Brigade branch, did not understand steelmaking technology before. Recently, he participated in the activity of smelting qualified steel and understood how to master the chemical composition of qualified steel, and felt more confident in leading production.

    In the activity of participating in smelting qualified steel, leading cadres also adopted the method of dissecting "sparrows" to solve many specific problems in production more quickly and timely. When participating in smelting qualified steel, Party Committee Secretary Hu Ziqiang discovered that the supply of desulfurizer was insufficient. After inspection, it was found that the stone grinding machine for grinding lime was broken and had not been repaired for two months, so he immediately organized forces and repaired it in only two days. For example, the size of limestone blocks was too large to easily form slag and desulfurize, which had not been paid much attention to in the past. After the leading cadres went down to smelt steel, they realized that the poor quality of limestone had a great impact on smelting qualified steel, so they immediately took improvement measures to improve the quality of limestone.

    After the leading cadres directly participated in technical operations, they also strengthened the work of promoting advanced experience. Before launching this activity, the advanced experience mastered by the leading cadres was mostly heard from reports. Sometimes, because they did not deeply understand its role and significance, they did not actively support it, so it was not promoted vigorously enough. Now, the leading cadres have learned and applied these advanced experiences in actual operation, and they feel more keenly the preciousness of these experiences, and have taken more powerful measures to promote these experiences. For example, worker Lu Jianqing has long used a simple method to desulfurize outside the cupola, and the desulfurization effect is generally above 60%. In the past, the factory did not vigorously promote it. Recently, after the leading cadres personally used this experience, they felt that the effect was very good, and immediately decided to promote it universally.

    The experience of Chongqing Steel Converter Plant No. 1 is being promoted throughout the company.

    既抓政治又抓技术　直接参加操作　加强生产领导
    重钢转炉一厂领导干部每天参加炼钢
    领导工作更加深入　钢产水平显著增长　干部走向红透专深
    据新华社重庆14日电　重庆钢铁公司转炉一厂的领导干部目前正在进行着一项很有意义的活动：每人每天分别深入到炉旁，直接参加操作，参加指挥，和工人一起炼出一炉合格钢。全厂所有党政工团的领导干部都参加了这项活动。他们通过实际操作，把政治同技术紧密结合起来，更有计划有组织地刻苦钻研技术，加速了干部红透专深的进程；这一活动使领导工作做得更细致更踏实，从而更好地促进了转炉高产优质双丰收。据这个厂8月1日到9日的统计，展开上述活动以后，全厂的钢产水平有了更显著的增长，钢的日产水平比上月同期增长了76％，合格率上升了9.4％。
    这个厂领导干部“每人每天炼一炉合格钢”的活动，是在实行跟工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量的基础上，紧密围绕当前生产关键开展的。厂党委最近总结了前一阶段领导干部深入第一线领导生产和坚持跟工人同吃同住同劳动同商量的经验。厂党委指出，过去领导干部深入第一线，在加强政治思想工作，进一步增强领导与群众的关系，以及改进炉子设备和技术操作等方面，都做出了很大的成绩；但是，由于对生产技术不够熟悉，对生产还没有作到深知深解，有些生产中的具体问题就抓得不够深透，特别是没有对转炉炼钢生产过程中从配料、化铁炉熔炼，一直到转炉吹炼、浇注等环节，一环扣一环地抓到底。这就需要领导干部既抓政治，又抓技术，通过直接参加炼钢，取得更多的技术经验，以便更好地针对生产关键，解剖“麻雀”，树立“样板”，加强对生产的领导。厂党委有鉴于此决定在全厂开展一个领导干部“每人每天炼一炉合格钢”的活动。这一决定得到全厂干部的热烈拥护。厂党委的正副书记，工厂的正副厂长，工会主席，团委书记和各轮班支部书记等人都迅速投入了冶炼合格钢的活动。
    这一活动使厂的领导干部把具体参加生产和领导生产更好地结合了起来，更有效地促进了生产。他们普遍反映，亲自参加了整个冶炼过程的操作以后，对掌握冶炼技术心中有了底，本领更高，办法更多。党委书记胡自强自己是钳工出身，对冶炼技术不熟悉，过去深入到哪里，就只能熟悉哪里的生产，对整个冶炼过程难以具体指挥。这次他首先带头上阵，虚心向群众学习，不仅很快掌握了操作转炉炼钢的技术，而且还进一步懂得了用高硫铁炼合格钢的窍门。一大班支部书记尹子信原来也不懂炼钢技术，最近参加了炼合格钢的活动，懂得了如何掌握合格钢的化学成份，对领导生产更觉心中有数了。
    领导干部在参加炼合格钢的活动中，还采用解剖“麻雀”的办法，更迅速及时地解决了生产当中的许多具体问题。党委书记胡自强在参加炼合格钢时发现脱硫剂供应不充分，经检查是磨石灰的盘磨机坏了，已经有两个月没有修复，于是立即组织力量，只用两天的时间就修好了。又如石灰石块度太大不好化渣脱硫，过去一直未被重视；领导干部下去炼钢以后，体会到石灰石质量不好，对炼合格钢影响很大，于是马上采取改进措施，提高了石灰石的质量。
    领导干部直接参加技术操作以后，也加强了推广先进经验的工作。开展这一活动以前，领导干部掌握的先进经验许多是从汇报中听来的，有时由于对它的作用和意义体会得不够深刻，积极支持不够，因而推广得不够有力。现在，领导干部在实际操作中学习和运用了这些先进经验，更加感到了这些经验的宝贵，对推广这些经验采取了更有力的措施。例如，工人卢健清长期以来用一种简易办法在化铁炉炉外脱硫，脱硫效果一般都在60％以上，过去厂里没有大力推广。最近，领导干部亲自运用这一经验以后，感觉效果很好，马上确定普遍推广。
    重钢转炉一厂的这一经验正在全公司推广。
