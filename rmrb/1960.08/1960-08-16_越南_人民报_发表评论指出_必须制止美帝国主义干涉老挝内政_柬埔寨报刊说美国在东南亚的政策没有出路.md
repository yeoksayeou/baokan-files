Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 15th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary on the Laotian situation today, pointing out that U.S. imperialism and the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc must be stopped from interfering in Laos' internal affairs.

The commentary said, "The coup d'état carried out by soldiers and people of Vientiane under the leadership of Captain Kong Le has received enthusiastic support from people of all strata in Vientiane and people in various parts of Laos, and has achieved important victories."

The commentary said that when the U.S. State Department announced that it only recognized the government of Tiao Somsanith, the Lao National Assembly unanimously voted to dissolve the pro-American and reactionary government of Tiao Somsanith, which was a head-on blow to U.S. imperialism. It must be pointed out that the behavior of U.S. imperialism and its vassal states in helping the Phoumi Nosavan-Tiao Somsanith clique to oppose the coup committee is a blatant interference in Laos' internal affairs, an open opposition to the Lao people, and an attempt to create tension in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The commentary said that, as pointed out by the coup committee, this coup is entirely a matter of Laos' internal affairs. That is to say, no imperialism and its vassal states have the right to interfere in Laos' internal affairs in any form.

The commentary pointed out, "Faced with the conspiracies and actions of imperialism and its lackeys, the Lao people and peace-loving people all over the world must be vigilant." The commentary said that United Press International threatened that "Laos is a country under the protection of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization must expand its protection of the Lao government." The Phoumi Nosavan reactionary elements, with the instigation and help of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary forces of Thailand and South Vietnam, are gathering military forces and preparing to attack the coup committee. According to foreign news, a batch of military vehicles has set off from Saigon towards the Laotian border.

The commentary also said that the Phoumi Nosavan clique is trying to squeeze into the soon-to-be-established government, attempting to maintain its power and undermine the coup committee's policy of peace and neutrality and its advocacy of national harmony.

The commentary concluded, "The just struggle carried out by the Lao people and the patriotic forces in the army under the command of the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le is part of the Lao people's anti-American patriotic movement and the movement against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in Asia and around the world. All Asian people and all peace-loving and just forces in the world stand on the side of the Lao people and resolutely fight to stop the interference of U.S. imperialism and its clique—the cause of the tense situation in Laos and the hindrance to the progress of the Lao people."

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, August 15th: The Cambodian weekly "Nationalist" published an editorial on the 13th regarding the coup recently launched by Captain Kong Le of Laos, saying that the United States "has lost in a new battle."

The editorial said, "The life of the Somsanith government, on which the 'free world' placed 'so much hope,' was only two months and six days." The Americans prided themselves on realizing the "Saigon-Bangkok-Vientiane triangle (axis)," but "the life of this painstakingly built building is only a few months."

The editorial said that Sihanouk has repeatedly pointed out that the U.S. policy in Southeast Asia has no way out. The editorial advocated, "Let Asian nationalism be freely expressed, and Asian nationalism tends towards strict neutrality."

    越南“人民报”发表评论指出
    必须制止美帝国主义干涉老挝内政
    柬埔寨报刊说美国在东南亚的政策没有出路
    据新华社河内15日电　越南“人民报”今天就老挝局势发表评论指出，必须制止美帝国主义和东南亚侵略集团干涉老挝的内政。
    评论说，“万象市士兵和人民在以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会领导下举行的政变，得到万象各阶层人民和老挝各地人民的热烈支持，并取得了重要的胜利。”
    评论说，当美国国务院宣布只承认昭·松萨尼特政府的时候，老挝国民议会一致投票解散昭·松萨尼特亲美反动政府，这对美帝国主义是一个迎头痛击。必须指出的是，美帝国主义及其附庸国帮助富米·诺萨万—昭·松萨尼特集团来反对政变委员会的行为，是对老挝内政的明目张胆的干涉，是公开反对老挝人民和竭力制造印度支那和东南亚的紧张局势的行为。
    评论说，正如政变委员会所指出的那样，这个政变完全是老挝内政的事务。这就是说，任何帝国主义及其附庸国都无权在任何形式下干涉老挝的内政。
    评论指出，“面对帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋和行动，老挝人民和全世界爱好和平的人民必须提高警惕。”评论说，合众国际社威胁说，“老挝是在东南亚条约组织保护下的国家，东南亚条约组织必须扩大对老挝政府的保护。”富米·诺萨万反动分子在美帝国主义以及泰国和南越反动势力的鼓动和帮助下，正在纠集军事力量，准备进攻政变委员会。据外国消息，一批军用汽车已从西贡向老挝边境进发。
    评论还说，富米·诺萨万集团正在想法钻进即将成立的政府中去，企图维持它的势力，破坏政变委员会的和平中立政策和民族和睦的主张。
    评论最后说，“在以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会的指挥下，老挝人民和军队中的爱国力量所进行的正义斗争，是老挝人民反美爱国运动以及亚洲和世界各地反对美帝国主义及其走狗的运动的一部分。全体亚洲人民和世界上爱好和平和正义的力量都站在老挝人民一边，并坚决为制止美帝国主义及其集团的干涉——造成老挝紧张局势和阻挠老挝人民进步的原因——而斗争。”
    据新华社金边15日电　柬埔寨“民族主义者”周刊13日就老挝贡勒大尉最近发动的政变发表社论说，美国“在一个新的战役中打输了”。
    社论说，“自由世界”寄予“那么大的希望的松萨尼特政府的寿命只有整整两个月零六天”。美国人以实现了“西贡—曼谷—万象三角（轴心）而自豪”，但是，“煞费苦心搞起来的这个建筑物的寿命只有几个月。”
    社论说，西哈努克一再指出，美国人在东南亚的政策没有出路。社论主张，“让亚洲的民族主义自由地表现出来，而亚洲的民族主义都趋向于严格的中立。”
