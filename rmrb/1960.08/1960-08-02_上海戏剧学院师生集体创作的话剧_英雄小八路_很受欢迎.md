Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 1st: The eight-act drama "Hero Little Eighth Route Army," collectively created and performed by teachers and graduating students of the Shanghai Theater Academy, depicting the children of the frontline in Fujian supporting the People's Liberation Army's bombardment of Jinmen, has been performed to full houses and has been extremely well received by audiences. In recent days, Shanghai newspapers have published many reviews praising and recommending this new play, believing that it vividly reflects the fearless spirit of Chinese children and the broad masses of people in opposing U.S. imperialist aggression, resolutely liberating Taiwan, and defending world peace, and that it has significant educational significance for the current struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. The newspapers have also published many stills from the play and stage sketches by artists.

    This play depicts the story of primary school students in He厝 Village, Xiamen, organizing the "Frontline Children's Support the Front Activities Brigade" during the PLA's bombardment of Jinmen in 1958. The play vividly portrays these brave Chinese children burning water and delivering food, washing and mending clothes, pursuing special agents, and repairing telephone lines on the front lines for the PLA.

    据新华社上海1日电　上海戏剧学院教师和毕业班学生集体创作和演出的八场话剧，描写福建前线少年儿童支援人民解放军炮击金门的“英雄小八路”，场场客满，受到观众极大的欢迎。连日来，上海报纸上发表了许多赞扬和推荐这个新戏的评论，认为它生动地反映了中国儿童和广大人民反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平的大无畏精神，对当前反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的斗争，具有重大的教育意义。报纸上还刊出了好多这个戏的剧照和画家们的舞台速写画。
    这个戏描写厦门何厝村的小学生们，在1958年我军炮击金门的战斗中，组织“前线少年支前活动大队”的故事。戏中生动地刻划了这些英勇的中国少年，在前沿阵地上为解放军烧水送饭、洗补衣服、追捕特务、抢修电话线等情景。
