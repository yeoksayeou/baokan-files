Short Commentary:

    In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, centered on grain and steel, concentrating efforts on increasing ore production, increasing coal production, and increasing pig iron production is a very important task; and concentrating efforts on doing a good job in iron transfer work is a major task at present.
    This newspaper pointed out in its editorial entitled "Immediately Launch a Production Increase and Economy Practice Movement Centered on Grain and Steel": "In industry, efforts must be concentrated first to ensure increased steel production. All enterprise employees who are responsible for the task of transferring pig iron, coal, and ore must strive to increase production and improve quality to fully guarantee the needs of key steel enterprises." How should we understand the phrase "concentrate efforts"? This means that the leadership's power and the masses' power should be concentrated on the main tasks. Any work has its main aspects and secondary aspects. Putting effort into the main aspects will achieve great results in the main aspects and drive the work in other aspects to move forward by leaps and bounds. Conversely, if the primary and secondary are not distinguished and the importance is reversed, the main aspects will be affected, which will also be detrimental to other aspects. There are many key links in the entire steel front. From the perspective of steelmaking, to produce more and better steel, more and better iron must be obtained. The ironmaking process is an intermediate link in the entire steel production. If it stops here, the iron will not become steel, and the steel will not become material. Even if more good iron is produced, it cannot become the equipment for production and construction. Therefore, to truly ensure the sustained growth of steel production, all ironmaking enterprises that have the task of transferring iron must not only concentrate their efforts on producing good iron, but also concentrate their efforts on transferring the good iron produced to key steel plants, so that it can exert greater power for socialist construction.
    Whether or not we can concentrate our efforts to transfer good iron in a timely manner depends on whether we have the concept of the whole country as a single chessboard and whether we have the style of the Pingxiang Iron and Steel Plant. In the first half of this year, the production of steel and coal increased by more than 50% compared with last year, which is the result of implementing the concept of the whole country as a single chessboard. Comrade Mao Zedong once taught us: Whether we are carrying out class struggle or production struggle, whether we are doing any kind of work, making plans, handling affairs, or thinking about problems, we must have an overall perspective and proceed from the basis of 600 million people. The issue of iron transfer is also an issue of proceeding from the basis of hundreds of millions of people. Starting from the basis of 600 million people, carrying forward the communist spirit, leaving the difficulties to ourselves and sending the convenience to others, then the iron transfer task will be completed better. Since the beginning of this year, the Pingxiang Iron and Steel Plant in Jiangxi has completed its tasks ahead of schedule every month and every quarter. This plant is unwavering in its transfer of pig iron. For the self-use pig iron of this enterprise, it is resolutely controlled, and not a single bit can be used casually. The Jingxi Mining Bureau, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, and Beijing Railway Bureau, based on the principle of "external before internal," overcame various difficulties and successfully completed the task of transferring coal and pig iron. This communist spirit of taking the overall situation into consideration and recognizing the importance of the overall situation, and this style of "self-denial and devotion to others" is worth promoting.
    According to past experience, to do a good job in the external transfer of pig iron, not only must we have a clear overall perspective in our thinking, but also a series of measures are needed in the organization. For example, how production units and transportation units closely cooperate, improve loading and unloading efficiency, accelerate vehicle turnover, how to strictly implement the inspection system within the enterprise to ensure the quality of external transfer products. How to achieve balance in the allocation plan to ensure that contracting units can arrange production according to the contract and according to the plan, etc., all of these require corresponding organizational measures to truly ensure the needs of key steel enterprises.
    At present, the important issue on the steel front is: to increase steel production, more pig iron must be supplied. To this end, we must concentrate our efforts and do everything possible to quickly transfer all the iron that can be transferred.

### 多调好铁多产钢

    多调好铁多产钢
    在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，集中力量增产矿石、增产煤炭、增产生铁是十分重要的任务；而集中力量做好调铁工作更是当前一项主要任务。
    本报在题为“立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动”的社论中指出：“工业方面，要集中力量首先保证钢的增产。所有担负外调生铁、煤炭、矿石等任务的企业职工，都要努力增产并提高质量，充分保证重点钢铁企业的需要。”应该怎样理解集中力量这句话呢？这就是说从领导的力量到群众的力量都要集中到主要任务上来。任何工作都有其主要方面和次要方面，把力量放到主要方面，就能在主要方面做出很大的成绩，带动其他方面的工作阔步前进。反之，主次不分，轻重倒置，主要方面受到影响，对其他方面也不利。整个钢铁战线有许多主要环节。从炼钢角度来看，要炼出又多又好的钢，就要得到又多又好的铁。炼铁工序是整个钢铁生产的中间一环，如果停留在这里，就铁不成钢，钢不成材，即使生产再多的好铁也不能成为生产和建设的器材。所以要真正保证钢的生产持续增长，一切负有外调任务的炼铁企业，不仅要集中力量生产好铁，而且要集中力量把生产出来的好铁调到重点钢厂去，使它对社会主义建设发挥出更大的力量。
    能不能集中力量及时调出好铁，关键在于有没有全国一盘棋的思想，有没有像萍乡钢铁厂那样的风格。今年上半年，钢铁煤的生产都比去年增长50％以上，这是贯彻全国一盘棋的成果。毛泽东同志曾经教导我们：不管进行阶级斗争或是生产斗争，不管是做那种工作，做计划，办事情，想问题，都要有全面观点，都要从六亿人口出发。调铁问题，也是一个从几亿人口出发的问题。从六亿人口出发，发扬共产主义精神，把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人，那末，调铁任务就会完成得更好。江西萍乡钢铁厂，今年以来，月月季季都提前超额完成任务。这个厂，对于外调生铁，坚定不移。对于本企业的自用生铁，则坚决控制，一点一滴也不能随便动用。京西矿务局、石景山钢铁公司和北京铁路办事处，本着“先外后内”的原则，克服种种困难，出色地完成了煤炭和生铁的外调任务。这种顾大局、识大体的共产主义精神，这种“克己为人”的风格，值得发扬。
    根据过去经验，做好生铁外调工作，不仅在思想上要有明确的全局观点，同时，在组织上也需要一系列的措施。譬如说生产单位和运输单位如何密切配合，提高装卸效率，加速车辆周转，在企业内部如何严格执行检验制度，保证外调产品的质量。在调拨计划方面如何做到平衡，保证合同单位能够按合同按计划安排生产等等，所有这些，都要有相应的组织措施，才能真正做到保证重点钢铁企业的需要。
    当前，钢铁战线上的重要问题是：要增加钢的产量，就要更多地供应生铁，为此，必须集中力量，千方百计，把一切能调的铁赶快调出来。
