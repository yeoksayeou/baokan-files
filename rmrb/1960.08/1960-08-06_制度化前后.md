    Before and After Institutionalization Wu Lü
    The Fuxin Coal Mine has established 134 underground offices, and more than 1,100 leading cadres at the level of pit section chief and above have moved to work underground. This is a major change in leadership methods, institutionalizing the leadership method of going deep into the front line of production.
    Institutionalization, which turns leadership methods proven effective in practice into formal systems, is an important measure to consolidate and improve the achievements of leadership methods. It is itself an important leadership method. This leadership method affirms effective leadership methods in individual units at the system level, expands their use to general units, and makes them a common weapon for general units to improve work and improve production. Many good systems in our enterprise leadership work are summarized from practice in this way, then return to practice, constantly enriching and developing. Conversely, some very good leadership methods, if not formalized into systems, often only appear briefly and are difficult to sustain.
    Taking coal mine production as an example, the characteristic of coal mine production is underground work. However, for a long time, the production command structure has been located above ground. This situation of "underground production, above-ground command" is the most typical manifestation of separating production from command. Because the coal seam and geological conditions underground often change, and these changes are difficult to grasp in a timely manner while sitting above ground, it often happens in coal mines that production deployments do not match the actual situation. Since the Great Leap Forward, changing the divorced-from-reality practice of "underground production, above-ground command" has become a common slogan, and there has been no shortage of experience in going underground to command production, but not many have persisted. Why? Perhaps one important reason is that these experiences have not been well summarized and formalized into systems. Comrades familiar with coal mines will know that going underground to command production is not a simple matter. If nothing else, without the determination to go down the mine, daily production affairs can entangle you above ground, keeping you busy all day long and unable to go down at all. When going underground to command production has not yet become a system, that is to say, when it still seems "optional," it is inevitable that "some go down, some don't," "sometimes they go down, sometimes they don't," and "they go down when the leadership pushes hard, and they don't go down when the leadership doesn't push hard." In the end, they unconsciously succumb to the force of habit, and it is once again "underground production, above-ground command." This is also easy to understand.
    Now, the underground office implemented in Fuxin, which institutionalizes the leadership method of going deep into the front line, has a much stronger vitality. In just over ten days, underground offices in Fuxin have spread from individual pit entrances to the entire mining area.
    However, we must not blindly believe in systems. Affirming some good leadership methods through systems does not mean that these leadership methods can be promoted smoothly from now on, let alone that they can be sustained for a long time. Affirming some good leadership methods through systems is a summary of the work in the previous stage and still only a beginning for future work. Whether these systems are implemented well and whether they are sustained for a long time depends on whether we adopt a serious attitude towards these systems. No matter how good the system, if there is a lack of a serious attitude, and it is not implemented earnestly, but rather casually "going through the motions," it will still not have an effect on production. With a serious attitude, carefully implementing these good systems into actual work, we will definitely achieve practical results in production and enable these systems to be continuously enriched and improved in practice.

    制度化前后	吴滤
    阜新煤矿建立起一百三十四个井下办公室，一千一百多名坑段长以上的领导干部都搬到井下办公去了。这是领导方法上一个重大的变革，它把深入生产第一线的领导方法制度化了。
    制度化，把一些在实践中证明是切实有效的领导方法订之为制度，是巩固改进领导方法的成果的一项重要措施。它本身就是一个重要的领导方法。这种领导方法把个别单位行之有效的领导方法从制度上肯定下来，扩大使用于一般单位，使之成为一般单位改进工作、搞好生产的共同武器。我们企业领导工作中许许多多好的制度，都是这样从实践中总结出来，又回到实践中去，不断地丰富、不断地发展的。相反地，有一些很好的领导方法，没有形成制度，就往往只是昙花一现，难以坚持。
    拿煤矿生产来说，煤矿生产的特点是地下作业。而长期以来，生产的指挥机构却是设在井上的。这种“井下生产，井上指挥”的情况是脱离生产指挥生产的最典型的表现。由于井下煤层情况和地质情况经常发生变化，这种变化是坐在井上很难及时掌握的，因而在煤矿经常发生生产部署同实际情况不相符合的情况。大跃进以来改变“井下生产，井上指挥”的脱离实际的做法，成为普遍的口号，到井下去指挥生产的经验也有不少，但是坚持下来的，却并不很多。为什么呢？恐怕没有把这些经验很好地加以总结，订成制度就是一个重要原因。熟悉煤矿的同志都会知道，到井下去指挥生产并不是一件很简单的事情。别的不说，若是没有下井的决心，日常的生产事务就能把你缠在井上，终日忙忙碌碌，根本下不去。当到井下去指挥生产还没有成为制度的时候，也就是说，似乎还是“可下可不下”的时候，就不可避免地会“有人下有人不下”、“有时下有时不下”、“领导抓得紧就下，领导抓得不紧就不下”，最后无形中屈服于习惯势力，重又是“井下生产，井上指挥”。这也是很容易理解的。
    现在，阜新实行的井下办公，把深入第一线的领导方法制度化了，它的生命力就强大得多。仅仅十几天的时间，阜新的井下办公就由个别坑口普及到整个矿区了。
    然而，我们又不能迷信制度。把一些好的领导方法用制度肯定下来，并不意味着这些领导方法从此就可以一帆风顺地推行开去，更不意味着就能长久地坚持下去。把一些好的领导方法用制度肯定下来，对前一阶段的工作说来是一个总结，对以后的工作说来仍只是一个开始。这些制度实行的好坏、是不是长久坚持下去，还要看我们对这些制度是不是采取严肃的态度。制度再好，缺乏严肃的态度，不是切切实实地去推行，而是马马虎虎地“走过场”，仍然不能在生产上收到效果。有了严肃的态度，认真把这些好的制度贯彻到实际工作中去，就一定能在生产上收到实效，并且能使这些制度在实践中得到不断的丰富，日趋完善。
