    Made of Steel Refined by Ourselves
    The Harbin Rolling Stock Plant, utilizing the labor saved during the technical revolution movement, has vigorously established small-scale, integrated iron and steel enterprises with foreign methods. Currently, this plant has set up satellite factories for the production of raw materials such as coking, ironmaking, steelmaking, steel rolling, and lime, capable of producing 26 products including coke, seamed steel pipes, and steel. Since the beginning of this year, the components of more than 770 vehicles in this plant have been entirely made of self-produced steel. This is a mine-specific "automatic dump train" with a load capacity of 60 tons, made of steel refined by themselves; workers are painting it. Xinhua News Agency reporter Feng Qi photographed it.

    用自己炼的钢制成的
    哈尔滨车辆厂利用技术革命运动中节约下来的劳动力，大办钢铁小洋联合企业。目前，这个厂已经办起炼焦、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、石灰等生产原材料的卫星小工厂，能生产焦炭、有缝钢管、钢材等二十六种产品。今年以来，这个厂已有七百七十多台车辆的零部件全部是用自制的钢材制成的。这是用自己炼的钢铁制成载重六十吨的矿山专用“自动翻斗列车”，工人正在喷油漆。　新华社记者　冯琦摄
