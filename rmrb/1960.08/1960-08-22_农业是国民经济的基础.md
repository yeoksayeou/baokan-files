Agriculture is the Foundation of the National Economy
Yang Ling

The development of China's national economy must be based on agriculture, with industry playing the leading role, combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture. This is a scientific summary of the experience of socialist construction in our country made by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and it is the most important component of our general line for socialist construction. The Party's policies and the results of practice have repeatedly shown and proven that under the socialist system, industry and agriculture are closely integrated and mutually reinforcing; agriculture is by no means merely passively adapting to and subject to the development of industry, but is able to actively and proactively promote and drive the development of industry and the entire national economy. One of the fundamental reasons for the high-speed and proportionate development of China's national economy is that we have found such a correct path of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously. This is a brilliant example of creatively applying the basic principles of Marxism to solve the problem of socialist economic construction; at the same time, it has developed and enriched Marxist political economy.

The Party and Chairman Mao Have Always Attached Importance to the Peasant and Agricultural Issues

The peasant and agricultural issues are of paramount importance in both revolution and construction. Our Party has always attached importance to the important role of agriculture in the entire economic construction, just as it attached importance to the important role of the peasants in previous political revolutions. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, during the democratic revolution, on the one hand, resolute struggles were waged against various erroneous ideas that neglected the great role of peasants in the revolution, and the closest alliance between the proletariat and the broad masses of peasants was established, laying a solid foundation for the victory of the revolution; on the other hand, the policy of "agricultural production is the first priority of our economic construction work" was determined. (Comrade Mao Zedong's report on "Our Economic Policy" made in Ruijin in 1934) In 1939, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The peasants account for about 80 percent of the total population of the country and are the main force of the current Chinese national economy." ("The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party") Under the difficult conditions of engaging in land revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the People's Liberation War, the Party led the masses of people to establish revolutionary base areas with abundant food and clothing, prosperity and happiness, and gained rich experience in carrying out economic construction before the victory of the revolution throughout the country. In 1945, in the political report "On the Coalition Government" at the Party's Seventh National Congress, Comrade Mao Zedong foresaw the extreme importance of the peasant and agricultural issues in the process of national industrialization. In 1948, he pointed out: "Eliminating the feudal system and developing agricultural production laid the foundation for developing industrial production and transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country." ("Speech at the Jin-Sui Cadre Conference")

After the nationwide liberation, even with the very heavy workload in the cities, the Party still attached great importance to rural work. In June 1950, Chairman Mao pointed out in the closing speech of the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The main population of China is peasants. The revolution relied on the assistance of the peasants to achieve victory, and the national industrialization will also rely on the assistance of the peasants to succeed." The Party and the state adopted a series of major policies and measures to promote the transformation of agricultural production relations and the development of agricultural productive forces. In three years, the output of major agricultural products was restored to and exceeded the highest level in past history. Subsequently, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao formulated the general line of socialist revolution in our country, and creatively put forward the famous principle that the steps of socialist transformation of agriculture in our country should be adapted to the steps of socialist industrialization, guiding more than 500 million peasants to rapidly embark on the socialist road. In the "First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China" put forward by the Party Central Committee, it was more clearly pointed out:

"We want to develop industry, but we must not lessen the significance of developing agriculture. On the contrary, actual life has further proved the extreme importance of agriculture to the industrial development. Without the corresponding development of agriculture, our industrialization undertaking is impossible to realize." In July 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": It is necessary to "resolve the contradiction between the needs of annually increasing commodity grain and industrial raw materials and the generally low yield of the current major crops," otherwise, "we will not be able to complete socialist industrialization"; and pointed out: Industry and agriculture "must not be divided and isolated from each other, and we must not only emphasize one aspect and weaken the other."

After leading the upsurge of the socialist revolution in the rural areas of the country and achieving the great victory of agricultural cooperation, immediately following, in January 1956, according to Comrade Mao Zedong's proposal, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the draft of the National Agricultural Development Program. This great program for the high-speed development of socialist agriculture and the construction of socialist new countryside played a significant role in promoting the upsurge of agricultural production and the upsurge of the entire socialist construction. In April 1956, at the enlarged meeting of the Central Political Bureau, Comrade Mao Zedong made a report on "Ten Major Relationships," listing the correct handling of the relationship between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry as the primary issue. In September of the same year, the resolution of the Eighth National Congress of the Party further pointed out: "Agriculture has many extremely important influences on the industrialization undertaking. The development of agriculture not only directly affects the level of people's lives and the speed of light industry development, but also affects the speed of heavy industry development. ...In the future, greater efforts must be made to develop agriculture." In February 1957, in the report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Comrade Mao Zedong more profoundly analyzed the relationship between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture, and pointed out that this is the issue of China's industrialization path, proposing "developing industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture." In September of the same year, the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, according to the situation of the new upsurge of socialist construction after the nationwide rectification movement, proposed and passed the revised draft of the Agricultural Development Program, which pointed in the preface: "The development of agriculture occupies an extremely important position in our country's socialist construction. Agriculture supplies industry with food and raw materials, and at the same time, the rural areas with a population of more than 500 million provide our industry with the world's largest domestic market. From this point of view, without our country's agriculture, there would be no our country's industry. It is completely wrong to ignore the importance of work in agriculture."

In May 1958, at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the general line of socialist construction was determined, and the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture was listed as one of the important contents of the basic points of this general line. The facts of the Great Leap Forward showed the power of this general line, and further proved that industry and agriculture can develop at high speed simultaneously. In the Great Leap Forward, according to the inevitable trend of agricultural production development in China and the great creation of the masses of people, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong promptly led the people of the country to establish people's communes in the rural areas, making the high-speed construction of socialism and the gradual transition to communism in the future have the best organizational form. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward and under the condition of the people's communes' increasingly consolidated and healthy development, China's socialist construction entered a new stage of sustained leap forward. At this time, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong further made a Marxist summary of the rich experience of the proletariat in leading socialist economic construction, and put forward the policy of taking "agriculture as the foundation, industry as the leading factor, combining the priority development of heavy industry with the simultaneous rapid development of agriculture," pointing out that accelerating the development of agriculture is the central link for developing China's socialist economic construction at a high speed and proportionately, and put forward the task of accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture.

The Party's Policies Correctly Reflect the Objective Laws of Economic Development

Taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, this policy fully conforms to the Marxist theory of expanded reproduction and correctly reflects the internal relationship between the two most important sectors of the national economy. According to the principle of expanded reproduction, the production of means of production must be given priority; similarly, according to this principle, the production of means of production must not be developed apart from the production of means of subsistence. Lenin said when expounding Marx's theory of reproduction: "The manufacture of means of production is not for the means of production themselves, but because the industrial sectors that manufacture consumer goods have an increasing need for means of production." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 4, p. 143) Of course, it is also due to the increasing need of the agricultural sector that manufactures consumer goods for means of production; the development of the industrial sector that manufactures consumer goods is more directly related to the development of agriculture. To realize expanded reproduction, there must be additional materialized labor (means of production and means of subsistence) and additional labor force. The additional means of production required for the expanded reproduction of heavy industry can basically be taken from this sector (also a part from light industry and agriculture), and the additional means of subsistence and labor force must have a considerable part from agriculture (a part from light industry). Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On the Coalition Government" that peasants are the source of industrial labor force and the main body of the industrial market, "only they can supply the richest food and raw materials, and absorb the largest amount of industrial products." In the report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," he pointed out: "In order to complete the large amount of funds required for national industrialization and agricultural technical transformation, a considerable part of it must be accumulated from agriculture. In addition to the direct agricultural tax, it is to develop the production of a large number of consumer goods needed by peasants, and use these things to exchange with peasants' commodity grain and light industrial raw materials, which not only meet the material needs of peasants and the country, but also accumulate funds for the country. And the large-scale development of light industry not only needs the development of heavy industry, but also needs the development of agriculture." In the report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," he more profoundly explained the reason why heavy industry should take agriculture as an important market: "With the gradual development of the technical reform of agriculture and the increasing modernization of agriculture, the machinery, fertilizers, water conservancy construction, power construction, transportation construction, civilian fuel, and civilian building materials serving agriculture will increase day by day. The situation of heavy industry taking agriculture as an important market will be easily understood by people. ...If our agriculture can have greater development, and light industry can have more corresponding development, it will be beneficial to the entire national economy. With the development of agriculture and light industry, heavy industry has a market and funds, and it will develop faster. In this way, the speed of industrialization seems to be slower, but in fact it will not be slow, but may be faster."

Because the Party's policies correctly reflect the objective laws of economic development, they have exerted great power in the actual actions of our people to build socialism. From 1950 to 1959, the total agricultural output value increased 1.7 times in ten years, with an average annual increase of 10.4%. This is an unprecedented high speed in history. This high speed of agricultural development occurred at the same time as the high speed development of industry, and played a significant role in the high speed development of industry. During the first five-year plan period, the total industrial output value increased by an average of 18% per year, and the total agricultural output value increased by an average of 4.5% per year, with a ratio of four to one; in the industrial output value, the means of production increased by 25.4%, occupying a priority position. In 1958, the total industrial output value increased by 66%, and the total agricultural output value increased by 25%, both of which greatly improved their speed, and the ratio between them changed to 2.65 to one; in the industrial output value, the means of production increased by 103%, still occupying a priority position. In 1959, the total industrial output value increased by 39.3%, and the total agricultural output value increased by 16.7%, both of which were still very fast, and the ratio between them changed to 2.35 to one; in the industrial output value, the means of production increased by 43.3%, still occupying a priority position. Judging from the growth rate of industry and agriculture, it is precisely the simultaneous development; judging from heavy industry, it is precisely the priority development; judging from agriculture, it is precisely the rapid development. From here, we can clearly see that industry and agriculture can develop at high speed simultaneously, and the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture are combined with each other. Such development is truly proportionate development.

The Development of Agriculture Has a Huge Promoting Effect on the Entire National Economy

The facts of China's economic construction fully prove that the Party Central Committee's policies and Comrade Mao Zedong's expositions on the important position of agriculture and the relationship between agriculture and industry correctly reflect objective truth. In recent years, in China's industrial output value, those using agricultural products as raw materials account for about half; in light industrial raw materials, those from agriculture account for about 80%; in China's total fiscal revenue, income directly and indirectly related to agriculture accounts for about half; in export commodities, agricultural products and their processed products account for more than 70%. Therefore, the abundance or scarcity of agriculture cannot but have a significant impact on the development speed of the national economy in the current year or the next year. From 1950 to 1959, the average annual growth rate of total agricultural output value was about 10.4%, and the average annual growth rate of total industrial output value was about 29.2%. Generally speaking, if the growth of agricultural output value exceeds the average speed, the growth of industrial output value in the next year will also exceed the average speed; if the growth of agricultural output value is much lower than the average speed, the growth rate of industrial output value in the next year will also be much lower than the average speed. From the growth of total national income and national fiscal revenue, it is roughly the same. In 1950, agriculture increased by 17.7%; in 1951, industry increased by 37.9%, national income increased by 17%, and national fiscal revenue increased nearly doubled. In 1952, agriculture increased by 15.3%; in 1953, industry increased by 30.2%, national income increased by 14%, and national fiscal revenue increased by 24%. In 1958, agriculture increased by 25%; in 1959, industry increased by 39.3%, national income increased by 21.6%, and national fiscal revenue increased by 29.4%. The above are the impact of the three years with faster agricultural growth in ten years on the next year. These figures fully illustrate that with good development of agriculture, all economic work will be easier; that is, accelerating the development of agriculture is the central link for developing the socialist economy at a high speed and proportionately. Let's look at the impact of the three years with slower agricultural growth in ten years on the next year: In 1953, agriculture increased by 3.1%; in 1954, industry increased by 16.3% (means of subsistence only increased by 14.2%), national income increased by 5.7%, and national fiscal revenue increased by 20.5%. In 1954, agriculture increased by 3.3%; in 1955, industry increased by 5.6% (means of subsistence decreased by 0.03%), national income increased by 6.5%, and national fiscal revenue increased by 3.7%. In 1956, agriculture increased by 4.9%; in 1957, industry increased by 11.4% (means of subsistence only increased by 5.6%), national income increased by 4.6%, and national fiscal revenue increased by 7.9%. How clearly is the impact of agriculture on the entire national economy manifested in these statistics! In these ten years, there was only one exception: In 1957, agriculture increased by 3.5%, and in 1958, industry increased by 66.2%. This special situation does not mean that agriculture no longer affects industry; in fact, it has a more significant impact. This is because 1958 was the year when the Great Leap Forward began, and the Great Leap Forward started from agriculture; the Great Leap Forward in agriculture in 1958 played a huge promoting role in the Great Leap Forward in industry in the same year.

The experience of China's economic construction also proves that the market issue is one of the most important issues in expanded reproduction. Whether it is light industry or heavy industry, if the products are not sold, then even simple reproduction cannot be realized. In China, the widest market for industrial products is the rural area, and the industrial consumer goods sold to the rural area account for more than 60% of the total retail sales of industrial consumer goods. The production and consumption of the vast rural area with a population of more than 500 million are playing an active role in promoting the development of industry. Accelerating the development of agriculture requires the rapid growth of the production of agricultural means of production, which is a huge force to promote the development of heavy industry. During the first five-year plan period, the total value of means of production supplied to the rural area by the state was 14.2 billion yuan; in 1958-1959, it reached 14.83 billion yuan in two years. This is far from meeting the needs of agriculture. Agricultural production requires millions of tractors, and now there are less than 100,000 in total, and the planned annual output in 1960 is only more than 20,000. Agricultural production requires tens of millions of horsepower of drainage and irrigation machinery, and now there are only a few million horsepower in total. Agricultural production needs tens of millions of tons of chemical fertilizers every year, and the annual output in 1959 was only more than 1.3 million tons. The accumulation of agricultural production funds is increasing very quickly, and the accumulation of rural people's communes in 1958 alone was 10 billion yuan. Most of these accumulations are used to purchase means of production; after communization, the need for large-scale means of production has increased even faster. With the development of agricultural production, the income of peasants is also increasing continuously. The average income of commune members in 1959 increased by more than 50% compared with 1952, by about 20% compared with 1957, and by about 10% compared with 1958. The increased income is mainly used to purchase means of subsistence, which directly promotes the development of light industry and indirectly promotes the development of heavy industry.

In the final analysis, this is a question of the relationship between production and consumption (including productive consumption and living consumption). As Marx said: Without production, there is no consumption, and without consumption, there is no production; if production is the starting point and consumption is the end point, this end point in turn affects the starting point, making the whole process restart. (See "Critique of Political Economy", p. 154) This is the case in all societies. It's just that in class societies, there are both connections and antagonistic contradictions between production and consumption; in socialist societies, they are mutually connected and mutually promoting, although there are still contradictions, but they are no longer antagonistic.

Agriculture is the Foundation of All Social Economic Development
The Difference in the Development Speed of Industry and Agriculture Can Be Eliminated

In any society, as long as agriculture exists, it must be the foundation of social economic development. From the time when primitive animal husbandry and primitive agriculture were produced, they have occupied the most important position in economic life. There was agriculture first, then handicraft industry, and then industry. The reason is very simple: agriculture is the "source of food and clothing." In agricultural production, what is particularly important is grain. Grain is the foundation of the foundation. The development of agriculture itself cannot be separated from grain production. No one can live without "eating human fireworks." If the grain produced by each agricultural laborer is only enough for himself to eat, any other production activities outside agriculture cannot be carried out, and agricultural production that produces industrial raw materials cannot be carried out; without a certain amount of grain as feed, animal husbandry, as an important sector of agriculture, cannot develop smoothly. Marx pointed out: "The productivity of agricultural labor is the natural basis of all surplus value production, and thus also the natural basis of all capital development. ...The productivity of agricultural labor that exceeds the needs of individual laborers is the basis of all society, especially the basis of capitalist production." ("Capital", Vol. 3, p. 1025) Because "the number of laborers who can be invested in industry and commerce without having to engage in agriculture...depends on how much agricultural products the farmers can produce above their own consumption." ("Theories of Surplus Value", Vol. 1, p. 41) However, in capitalist society, capital, mainly formed within the scope of industry and commerce, increasingly weighs heavily on agriculture. It cannot be separated from agriculture and wants to extract grain and raw materials from agriculture; but it obtains labor force by bankrupting rural laborers and accumulates capital by cruelly exploiting rural laborers. In this way, the urban-rural antagonism of thousands of years is further deepened, the development of industry and agriculture is extremely unbalanced, and the development of agriculture lags behind industry. At the same time, due to the malformed development of industry, the domestic agriculture cannot meet the needs of industry, and the capitalist economy must seek raw material bases and markets abroad, relying on the agriculture of the colonies to strengthen its foundation. This is one of the important roots of the aggressive nature of imperialism. As a result, it is bound to make colonial agriculture tend to wither, and the antagonism between them and the colonies will become increasingly sharp. The simultaneous high-speed development of industry and agriculture is fundamentally impossible in capitalist society. The basic economic laws of capitalism determine this. The purpose of capitalist production is not consumption, but to squeeze as much surplus value as possible. Bloodthirsty capital makes industrial and agricultural laborers increasingly impoverished, increases the price of means of subsistence, and makes agriculture unable to develop rapidly due to "overproduction." Lenin said: "The lag in the development of agriculture behind industry is an inherent phenomenon in all capitalist countries, and is one of the most profound reasons for the disruption of proportions between various sectors of the national economy, the occurrence of crises, and the rise in prices." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 22, p. 84) Such an economic foundation is reflected in its superstructure, "the most popular idea in bourgeois economics is that industry and agriculture are opposed to each other." Those who believe that it is impossible to develop agriculture at high speed at the same time as developing industry at high speed, and those who believe that agriculture should be in a passive and backward position in the national economy, are precisely treating the phenomena unique to capitalist society as eternal truths. They do not understand: "The fact that industry develops more rapidly than agriculture is originally a characteristic of the capitalist production method. But this is a historical difference that can be eliminated." (Marx: "Theories of Surplus Value", Vol. 2, p. 247)

In the entire history of mankind in the past, agriculture has not always been backward. Under the pre-capitalist mode of production, the productivity of agriculture was generally higher than that of industry. During the period of vigorous development of capitalism, the productivity of industry developed faster than that of agriculture. Later, in a certain period, some capitalist countries could also temporarily make the development speed of agriculture faster due to special conditions; however, due to the inherent contradictions of capitalist society, it is never possible to eliminate the difference in the development speed of industry and agriculture under the capitalist system. This "historical difference" can only be gradually eliminated in the process of socialist economic construction. Our Party is leading the people of the country to engage in an extremely important historical task, which is to eliminate this "historical difference." In our country, there is also a special situation: it has been oppressed and exploited by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism for a long time, and both industry and agriculture are relatively backward, and the proportion of industry in the national economy is particularly small. In a certain historical period, we still cannot but make the development speed of industry faster than the development speed of agriculture. In our country, this is precisely a necessary process to accelerate the development speed of the entire national economy, including agriculture. In this process, although the development speed of industry should be faster, the distance between the development speed of agriculture and industry is shrinking. The correct way to shorten this distance is not to slow down the development speed of industry, but to accelerate the development speed of agriculture. That is to say, it is active balance, not passive balance. Under the socialist system, industry and agriculture become a unified national economic whole, the purpose of production is to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people, and the domestic market can always accommodate more and more means of subsistence, and is never afraid of "overproduction." The basic economic laws of socialism determine this, and the laws of planned and proportionate development of the socialist economy also determine this.

Under the socialist system, since industry and agriculture still have essential differences, there are still certain contradictions. However, these contradictions are no longer antagonistic and can become a driving force for mutual promotion. Agriculture cannot fully meet the requirements of industrial development, and industry cannot fully meet the requirements of agricultural development. The two sides make higher demands on each other, which is one of the manifestations of mutual promotion. The ownership of industry and agriculture is different for a certain period, the degree of mechanization is different for a certain period, and the labor productivity is also different for a certain period; the production conditions and the influence of natural factors are also different, and this difference will last longer. These differences will inevitably affect the difference in development speed. However, through people's subjective efforts, this difference in speed can be reduced. From 1950 to 1952, the ratio of the average annual growth rate of total industrial output value and total agricultural output value was 2.47 to one; after the start of large-scale economic construction, in order to change the situation of very weak industry left over from our country's history, the development speed of industry greatly accelerated, and the ratio of the average annual growth rate of total industrial output value and total agricultural output value during the first five-year plan period changed to four to one; in 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, under the condition that both industry and agriculture had great development, the growth speed between the two changed to 2.65 to one; in 1959, under the condition that both industry and agriculture continued to leap forward, the growth speed between the two changed to 2.35 to one. Due to natural reasons or other reasons, the development speed of industry and agriculture may not necessarily be closer year by year in the future; however, in terms of the overall development trend, after the proportion of industry and agriculture reaches a certain level, their development speed will inevitably be closer. Before labor productivity has not been improved to a considerable level, there will inevitably be various specific contradictions in the allocation of labor force, technical force, funds, raw materials, and equipment between industry and agriculture. However, as long as they are properly arranged, these contradictions can be resolved. These contradictions will never hinder the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture; on the contrary, only by developing industry and agriculture simultaneously can these contradictions be fundamentally resolved.

Taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor is by no means a temporary policy, but a fundamental and long-term policy. Some people think that it is only necessary to take industry as the leading factor in individual periods, and after heavy industry has greatly developed and national industrialization and agricultural mechanization have been realized, it is no longer necessary to give priority to the development of heavy industry. This is not right. After agriculture is highly mechanized, the leading role of industry will not be reduced, but will inevitably increase even more. Some people think that it is only necessary to take agriculture as the foundation in individual periods, and after agriculture has greatly developed and agricultural labor productivity has been greatly improved, it is no longer necessary to pay attention to the development of agriculture. This is also not right. Production must be continuously expanded, living standards must be gradually improved, and the population must increase year by year; in the future, the industrial population will always increase, and the agricultural population that produces industrial raw materials will always increase. Therefore, agricultural products, especially grain, must be continuously increased. At a time when human power cannot fully control nature, and when it cannot be guaranteed that the output of grain and other agricultural products can be stably and greatly increased every year, it is even more necessary to increase the production of various agricultural products, especially grain, as much as possible, in order to increase reserves. The leading role of industry is becoming more and more important, and the basic role of agriculture will also become more and more important. Agricultural production is not only for the production of means of subsistence; in agricultural products, the proportion of means of production is bound to become larger and larger. With the development of industry, agriculture will have to provide more industrial raw materials, and more parts of grain will also become industrial raw materials. The development of agriculture itself also requires more grain and means of production from agriculture.

How to further implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation? On the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen the strength of agriculture itself and give full play to the strength of agriculture itself; on the other hand, it is necessary to mobilize industry and other aspects to support agriculture with greater strength.

It is Necessary to Continuously Adjust and Improve Production Relations and the Superstructure
It is Necessary to Greatly Strengthen the Leadership and Labor Force of Agriculture

There must be sufficient estimates of the power of agriculture itself for expanded reproduction. The greater increase in agricultural labor productivity certainly depends on the development of industry; however, the development of industry must first depend on the increase in agricultural labor productivity. It must be seen that agriculture itself has huge potential to improve labor productivity. The fundamental changes in production relations and the superstructure have liberated these potentials, and further partial adjustments and improvements in production relations and the superstructure can continue to liberate these potentials. Lenin pointed out long ago that in order to build socialism and to improve people's lives, it is first necessary to increase grain production, that is, to improve the productivity of farmers first. He said: "It should start from the farmers," and criticized those who did not understand this as people who "do not seriously think about the problem and fall into empty talk." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 32, p. 332) He also pointed out: "The increase in agricultural productivity will inevitably promote the development of our industry." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 33, p. 105) The facts in our country have long proved that agricultural cooperation can and must be realized before the realization of agricultural mechanization. With the changes in production relations, the improvement of mass consciousness, the reform of cultivation techniques, the strengthening of leadership, and the improvement of work methods, the labor productivity of agriculture can also be greatly improved. It must never passively wait for agricultural mechanization, but fully mobilize the broad masses, especially the initiative of the peasant masses themselves to improve agricultural production. This is precisely a necessary condition for accelerating industrial development and striving to achieve agricultural mechanization as soon as possible.

In order to further give play to the power of agriculture itself for expanded reproduction, it is necessary to make significant efforts from several aspects: First, continue to consolidate and develop people's communes, and conduct adjustment, improvement, and construction work in terms of operation and management, rules and regulations, labor organization, political work, cadre style, and work methods, that is, to make production relations more compatible with productive forces, and to make the superstructure play a greater role in promoting the foundation. Second, ensure that the main line of agricultural production has sufficient main labor force. Third, carry out agronomic and tool reforms more meticulously and scientifically in accordance with the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. There are two ways to expand reproduction: one is expanded reproduction under the condition that the technical conditions remain unchanged, mainly relying on the increase in the amount of labor and the improvement of labor efficiency, etc.; the other is expanded reproduction under the condition of technical improvement, mainly relying on the innovation of production tools and technology. These two methods are often carried out simultaneously in actual production. Under the current conditions in our country, it is even more necessary for the expanded reproduction of agriculture to carry out both methods simultaneously. For this reason, it is necessary to use sufficient labor force in agricultural production, it is necessary to improve the organization and use of labor force, and it is also necessary to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. These mainly rely on the strength of agriculture itself.

At present, the core issue of implementing the strategic policy of taking agriculture as the foundation is the rational arrangement and correct use of labor force. First of all, it is necessary to concentrate the most and strongest labor force on the front line of agricultural production, especially on the grain production front. From a longer historical period, "farmers - this is the predecessor of Chinese workers." To realize national industrialization, "there must be a long process of transforming the rural population into the urban population." ("On the Coalition Government") To develop industrial production, it is necessary to absorb a certain labor force from the rural area. Peasants are the most reliable allies of the working class and the most powerful reserve force of the working class. However, it must be noted that this refers to "a long process." The transformation of peasants into workers must have certain conditions and must be carried out under a certain plan. The prerequisite for any industry to absorb labor force from agriculture is the improvement of agricultural labor productivity. The quantity, quality, and time of absorbing labor force from agriculture must be adapted to the degree of improvement of agricultural labor productivity, the total output of agricultural products, and the situation of needs. This is a very important principle, and only in this way can the healthy development of the entire national economy be guaranteed. In a certain period and in some cases, industry and other industries not only cannot transfer agricultural labor force, but also need to extract a part of the labor force to go to the agricultural area; at the same time, it is necessary to use methods such as concentrating forces to support agriculture and accelerate technical transformation to rapidly improve agricultural labor productivity. This is precisely "if you want to take it, you must first give it." To change the situation of "more than 500 million people making rice," to absorb labor force from the agricultural area, it is necessary to first concentrate superior forces to develop agricultural production. In the agricultural population of our country, the labor force accounts for about one-third to two-fifths; every 1% increase in agricultural labor productivity can free up more than one million to more than two million labor force while maintaining the total amount of agricultural products unchanged. This does not mean that every 1% increase in agricultural labor productivity can draw out the same proportion of labor force from the agricultural area. When arranging the labor force, it is also necessary to see the development of industry and agriculture, especially the situation of agriculture. Under the current situation, even if a part of labor productivity is increased, it should still be used for the expanded reproduction of agriculture, especially the expanded reproduction of grain. Because it is not enough to just maintain the current annual output of agricultural products, especially grain, the development of the entire economic construction situation requires the annual output of agricultural products, especially grain, to be increased more and faster. After agricultural labor productivity is increased to a certain level, then further increasing labor productivity can gradually transfer more to industrial production and become a fresh force for further developing industrial production. Developing agricultural production is a great cause of the whole Party and the whole people.

Industry Can Fully Play a Leading Role in Supporting Agriculture

At the same time, it must be recognized that developing agricultural production is the cause of the whole people. In April this year, when the Second Session

    农业是国民经济的基础
    杨岭
    我国国民经济的发展，必须以农业为基础，以工业为主导，优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合。这是党中央和毛主席对我国社会主义建设的经验所作的科学的总结，是我们的社会主义建设总路线的最重要的组成部分。党的方针和实践的结果一次又一次地说明和证明了：在社会主义制度下，工业和农业是密切结合、互相促进的；农业决不只是消极地被动地适应于和受制于工业的发展，而是能够积极地主动地促进和推动工业以及整个国民经济的发展的。我国国民经济的高速度按比例发展，根本原因之一就是找到了这样一条工业和农业同时并举的正确的道路。这是创造性地运用马克思主义的基本原理解决社会主义经济建设问题的一个光辉的范例；同时，这又发展了和丰富了马克思主义的政治经济学。
    党和毛主席一向重视农民问题和农业问题
    农民问题和农业问题，在革命中和建设中都是头等重要的问题。我们的党一向重视农业在整个经济建设中的重要作用，正像重视农民在历次政治革命中的重要作用一样。在毛泽东同志领导下，在民主革命时期，一方面，对忽视农民在革命中的重大作用的各种错误思想进行了坚决的斗争，建立了无产阶级和广大农民群众的最密切的联盟，为革命的胜利打下了巩固的基础；另方面，确定了“农业生产是我们经济建设工作的第一位”的方针。（毛泽东同志1934年在瑞金所作关于《我们的经济政策》的报告）1939年，毛泽东同志又指出：“农民在全国总人口中大约占百分之八十，是现时中国国民经济的主要力量。”（《中国革命和中国共产党》）党领导人民群众，在从事土地革命、抗日战争和人民解放战争的艰苦条件下，建立了丰衣足食繁荣康乐的革命根据地，在革命在全国范围内胜利之前就取得了进行经济建设的丰富的经验。1945年，毛泽东同志在党的第七次代表大会的政治报告《论联合政府》中，就预见到农民问题和农业问题在国家工业化的过程中的极端重要性。1948年，又指出：“消灭封建制度发展农业生产，就给发展工业生产，变农业国为工业国的任务奠定了基础”。（《在晋绥干部会议上的讲话》）
    全国解放以后，在城市工作十分繁重的情况下，党对农村工作仍然极为重视。1950年6月，毛主席在《中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第二次会议闭幕词》中指出：“中国的主要人口是农民，革命靠了农民的援助才取得了胜利，国家工业化又要靠农民的援助才能成功。”党和国家采取了一系列重大的政策和措施，促进了农业生产关系的变革和农业生产力的发展，三年时间就使主要农产品的产量恢复和超过了过去历史上最高的水平。随后，党中央和毛主席制定了我国社会主义革命的总路线，并且创造性地提出了我国农业的社会主义改造的步骤和社会主义工业化的步骤相适应的著名原理，指导五亿多农民迅速地走上了社会主义道路。在党中央提出的《中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划》中，更明确地指出：
    “我们要发展工业，但决不能够减轻发展农业的意义。相反，实际生活已经更加证明农业对于发展工业的极端重要性。没有农业的相应发展，我们的工业化事业是不可能实现的。”1955年7月，毛泽东同志在《关于农业合作化问题》的报告中又指出：必须“解决年年增长的商品粮食和工业原料的需要同现时主要农作物一般产量很低之间的矛盾”，不然，“我们就不可能完成社会主义工业化”；并且指出：对于工业和农业“决不可以分割起来和互相孤立起来去看，决不可以只强调一方面，减弱另一方面”。
    在领导全国农村掀起社会主义革命的高潮取得了农业合作化的伟大胜利之后，紧接着，1956年1月，根据毛泽东同志的提议，中共中央政治局提出了全国农业发展纲要草案。这个高速度发展社会主义农业和建设社会主义新农村的伟大纲领，对于推进农业生产高潮和整个社会主义建设高潮都起了重大作用。1956年4月，在中央政治局扩大会议上，毛泽东同志作了关于“十大关系”的报告，把正确处理工业和农业、重工业和轻工业的关系列为首要问题。同年9月，党的第八次代表大会的决议中进一步指出：“农业对于工业化事业有多方面的极其重大的影响。农业的发展不仅直接地影响着人民生活的水平和轻工业发展的速度，而且也影响着重工业发展的速度。……今后必须用更大的力量发展农业。”1957年2月，毛泽东同志在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》报告中，更精辟地分析了重工业、轻工业和农业的关系问题，并且指出这是中国工业化的道路问题，提出“发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举”。同年9月，党的八届三中全会根据全民整风运动以后出现的社会主义建设新高潮的形势，提出和通过了农业发展纲要修正草案，在序言中又指出：“发展农业在我国社会主义建设中占有极重大的地位。农业用粮食和原料供应工业，同时，有五亿以上人口的农村，给我国工业提供了世界上的最巨大的国内市场。从这些说来，没有我国的农业，便没有我国的工业。忽视农业方面工作的重要性是完全错误的。”
    1958年5月，在党的八大二次会议上，确定了社会主义建设的总路线，把工业和农业同时并举列为这条总路线的基本点的重要内容之一。大跃进的事实显示了这条总路线的威力，更进一步证明了工业和农业可以同时高速度地发展。在大跃进中，党中央和毛泽东同志根据中国农业生产发展的必然趋势和人民群众的伟大创造，及时地领导全国农村人民建立了人民公社，使高速度地建设社会主义和将来逐步过渡到共产主义有了最好的组织形式。在大跃进的基础上和人民公社日益巩固、健康发展的条件下，我国的社会主义建设进入了持续跃进的新阶段。就在这时候，党中央和毛泽东同志又进一步地对于无产阶级领导社会主义经济建设的丰富经验作了马克思主义的总结，提出了以农业为基础、以工业为主导，优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合的方针，指出了加速发展农业是高速度按比例地发展我国社会主义经济建设的中心环节，并且提出了加速对农业进行技术改造的任务。
    党的方针正确地反映了经济发展的客观规律
    以农业为基础，以工业为主导，这个方针完全符合马克思主义的扩大再生产原理，正确地反映了国民经济的两个最重要的部门之间的内在联系。根据扩大再生产原理，生产资料的生产必须优先发展；同样是根据这个原理，生产资料的生产决不能离开生活资料的生产而发展。列宁在阐述马克思的再生产原理时说：“生产资料的制造不是为了生产资料本身，而是由于制造消费品的工业部门对生产资料的需要日益增加。”（《列宁全集》第4卷第143页）当然，同样也由于制造消费品的农业部门对生产资料的需要的日益增加；制造消费品的工业部门的发展，同农业的发展更有直接的关系。要实现扩大再生产，必须有追加的物化劳动（生产资料和生活资料）和追加的劳动力。重工业扩大再生产要追加的生产资料基本上可以取自本部门（也有一部分取之于轻工业和农业），要追加的生活资料和劳动力都要有相当大部分来自农业（一部分取自轻工业）。毛泽 东同志在《论联合政府》中就已经指出农民是工业的劳动力的来源，又是工业市场的主体，“只有他们能够供给最丰富的粮食和原料，并吸收最大量的工业品。”在《关于农业合作化问题》的报告中又指出：“为了完成国家工业化和农业技术改造所需要的大量资金，其中有一个相当大的部分是要从农业方面积累起来的。这除了直接的农业税以外，就是发展为农民所需要的大量生活资料的轻工业的生产，拿这些东西去同农民的商品粮食和轻工业原料相交换，既满足了农民和国家两方面的物资需要，又为国家积累了资金。而轻工业的大规模的发展不但需要重工业的发展，也需要农业的发展。”在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》报告中，更精辟地说明了重工业要以农业为重要市场的道理：“随着农业的技术改革逐步发展，农业的日益现代化，为农业服务的机械、肥料、水利建设、电力建设、运输建设、民用燃料、民用建筑材料等等将日益增多，重工业以农业为重要市场的情况，将会易于为人们所理解。……如果我们的农业能够有更大的发展，使轻工业相应地有更多的发展，这对于整个国民经济会有好处。农业和轻工业发展了，重工业有了市场，有了资金，它就会更快地发展。这样，看起来工业化的速度似乎慢一些，但是实际上不会慢，反而可能快一些。”
    正因为党的方针正确地反映了经济发展的客观规律，所以它在我国人民建设社会主义的实际行动中发挥出了巨大的力量。从1950年到1959年，农业总产值十年间增长了一点七倍，平均每年递增幅度是10.4％。这是历史上前所未有的高速度。这个发展农业的高速度是在高速度发展工业的同时出现的，并且对工业的高速度发展起了重大的作用。第一个五年计划期间，工业总产值每年平均增长18％，农业总产值平均增长4.5％，两者之间的比例是四比一；在工业产值中，生产资料增长25.4％，占着优先地位。1958年，工业总产值增长66％，农业总产值增长25％，两者的速度都大大提高了，它们之间的比例则改变为二点六五比一；在工业产值中，生产资料增长103％，仍占着优先地位。1959年，工业总产值增长39.3％，农业总产值增长16.7％，两者的速度仍然都是很快的，它们之间的比例又改变为二点三五比一；在工业产值中，生产资料增长43.3％，还是占着优先地位。从工业和农业的增长速度来看，正是同时并举；从重工业来看，正是优先发展；从农业来看，也正是迅速发展。从这里，我们可以很清楚地看到：工业和农业是能够同时高速度发展的，优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业是互相结合的。这样的发展，也真正是按比例的发展。
    农业的发展对整个国民经济有巨大的促进作用
    我国经济建设的事实，充分证明了党中央的方针和毛泽东同志关于农业的重要地位和农业工业之间的关系的论断正确地反映了客观真理。近几年我国工业产值中，以农产品为原料的占大约一半；在轻工业原料中，来自农业的约占80％；在我国全部财政收入中，直接和间接与农业有关的收入，约占一半左右；在出口商品中，农产品及其加工品占70％以上。因此，农业的丰歉，对当年或次年的国民经济发展速度就不能不发生重大的影响。1950年到1959年十年间，农业总产值平均每年递增速度约10.4％，工业总产值平均每年递增速度约29.2％。一般地说，农业年产值的增长超过平均速度的，次年工业年产值的增长就也超过平均速度；农业年产值的增长低于平均速度很多的，次年工业年产值的增长速度也低于平均速度很多。从全部国民收入和国家财政收入增长的情况来看，大体上也是这样。1950年，农业增长17.7％；1951年，工业增长37.9％，国民收入增长17％，国家财政收入增长近一倍。1952年，农业增长15.3％；1953年，工业增长30.2％，国民收入增长14％，国家财政收入增长24％。1958年，农业增长25％；1959年，工业增长39.3％，国民收入增长21.6％，国家财政收入增长29.4％。以上是十年间农业增长速度较快的三年对次年发生的影响。这些数目字充分地说明了：农业有了很好的发展，一切经济工作就都好办；也就是说，加速发展农业是高速度按比例发展社会主义经济的中心一环。下面再看看十年间农业增长速度较慢的三年对次年发生的影响：1953年，农业增长3.1％；1954年，工业增长16.3％（生活资料只增长14.2％），国民收入增长5.7％，国家财政收入增长20.5％。1954年，农业增长3.3％；1955年，工业增长5.6％（生活资料减少0.03％），国民收入增长6.5％，国家财政收入增长3.7％。1956年，农业增长4.9％；1957年，工业增长11.4％（生活资料只增长5.6％），国民收入增长4.6％，国家财政收入增长7.9％。农业对整个国民经济的影响，在这些统计数字中表现得多么鲜明！在这十年中，只有一个例外：1957年，农业增长3.5％，1958年，工业增长66.2％。这个特殊情况，并不说明农业对工业不再发生影响了；实际上，是发生了更重大的影响。这是因为：1958年是大跃进开始的一年，而大跃进又是从农业开始的；1958年农业的大跃进，当年对工业的大跃进就起了巨大的促进作用。
    我国经济建设的经验也证明了：市场问题，是扩大再生产的最重要的问题之一。无论是轻工业还是重工业，产品不销售出去，那就连简单再生产也不可能实现。在我国，工业产品的最广大的市场是农村，销售于农村的工业消费品占全部工业消费品零售额的60％以上。有五亿多人口的广大农村的生产和消费，都对工业的发展起着积极的推动作用。加速发展农业就要求农业生产资料的生产迅速增长，这是推动重工业发展的一个巨大的力量。第一个五年计划期间，国家供应农村生产资料总值是一百四十二亿元；1958年—1959年，两年就达到一百四十八亿三千万元。这还远不能满足农业的需要。农业生产需要几百万台拖拉机，现在总共还不到十万台，1960年计划年产量才二万多台。农业生产需要几千万马力的排灌机械，现在总共只有几百万马力。农业生产每年需要几千万吨化学肥料，而1959年年产量才一百三十多万吨。农业生产资金的积累，增加得很快，仅1958年一年农村人民公社的积累就有一百亿元。这些积累，绝大部分是购买生产资料用的；公社化以后，对大型生产资料的需要增加得更快。农业生产发展了，农民的收入也不断增加。1959年公社社员的平均收入，比1952年增加50％以上，比1957年增加20％左右，比1958年也增加10％左右。增加的收入主要是购买生活资料的，这就直接促进了轻工业的发展，又间接促进了重工业的发展。
    归根到底，这是个生产和消费（包括生产消费和生活消费）的关系的问题。正如马克思所说的：没有生产就没有消费，没有消费就没有生产；如果说生产是起点、消费是终点，这终点反过来又影响起点，使整个过程重新开始。（见《政治经济学批判》第154页）这在一切社会都是如此。只不过，在阶级社会里，生产和消费之间既有联系又有对抗性的矛盾；在社会主义社会里，它们之间是互相联系、互相促进，虽然仍有矛盾，但不再是对抗性的了。
    农业是一切社会经济发展的基础
    工农业发展速度的差异能够消灭
    在任何社会，只要有农业存在，它就必然是社会经济发展的基础。从原始畜牧业、原始农业产生的时候起，它们在经济生活中就居于最重要的地位。首先有了农业，以后才有了手工业，然后才有了工业。道理很简单：农业是“衣食之源”。在农业生产中，特别重要的是粮食生产。粮食是基础的基础。农业本身的发展，也离不开粮食生产。任何人要活着都不能“不食人间烟火”。如果每个农业劳动者生产的粮食都只够自己吃，农业以外的其它任何生产事业就都没法子进行，生产工业原料的农业生产也没法子进行；没有一定的粮食作饲料，作为农业的一个重要部门的畜牧业也不可能顺利发展。马克思指出：“农业劳动生产率，是一切剩余价值生产的自然基础，从而也是一切资本发展的自然基础。……超越于劳动者个人需要的农业劳动生产率，是一切社会的基础，尤其是资本主义生产的基础。”（《资本论》第3卷第1025页）因为“能够投于工商业上面而无须从事农业的劳动者人数……取决于农业者在他们自身的消费额以上，能够生产多少的农产物。”（《剩余价值学说史》第1卷第41页）但是，在资本主义社会里，主要在工商业范围内形成的资本越来越沉重地压迫着农业。它离不开农业，要从农业索取粮食和原料；但又用使农村劳动者破产的办法取得劳动力，用残酷压榨农村劳动者的办法聚积资本。这样，就使几千年来的城乡对立进一步加深，工业农业的发展极不平衡，使农业的发展落后于工业。同时，由于工业的畸形发展，本国农业不能满足工业的需要，资本主义经济就必然要向国外寻求原料基地和市场，依靠殖民地的农业来加强自己的基础。这正是帝国主义的侵略本性的重要根源之一。而其结果，又必然是使殖民地农业也趋于凋蔽，使它们和殖民地之间的对立日益尖锐化。工业和农业同时高速度发展，这在资本主义社会是根本办不到的事情。资本主义的基本经济规律决定了这一点。资本主义生产的目的并不是消费，而是尽可能多地榨取剩余价值。嗜血的资本使工农劳动者日益贫困化，使生活资料涨价，使农业因“生产过剩”而不能迅速发展。列宁说：“农业的发展落后于工业，这是一切资本主义国家所固有的现象，是国民经济各部门间的比例遭到破坏、发生危机和物价高涨的最深刻的原因之一。”（《列宁全集》第22卷，第84页）这样的经济基础在它的上层建筑中得到了反映，“资产阶级经济学中最流行的思想，就是工业和农业是对立的。”认定高速度发展工业就不可能同时高速度发展农业的人，认定农业在国民经济中要处于被动、落后地位的人，正是把资本主义社会特有的现象看成了永恒的真理。他们不了解：“工业比农业发展得更迅速这件事，本来就是资本主义生产方法的特征。但这是一个历史上的差异，是能够消灭的。”（马克思：《剩余价值学说史》第2卷，第247页）
    在过去人类的全部历史上，农业并不是从来就是落后的。在前资本主义的生产方式下，农业的生产率一般地说总是高于工业。在资本主义蓬勃发展时期，工业的生产率才比农业发展得快了。后来，在一定时期，有的资本主义国家由于特殊的条件也能暂时使农业的发展速度提高得快一些；但是，由于资本主义社会所固有的矛盾，在资本主义制度下，永远也不可能消除工业和农业发展速度的差异。这种“历史上的差异”，只有在社会主义经济建设的过程中才能逐步消灭。我们的党领导着全国人民正在从事的一个极其重大的历史任务，就是消灭这种“历史上的差异”。在我国，又有一种特殊的情况：曾经长时期受着帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的几重压迫剥削，工业和农业都比较落后，而工业在国民经济中的比重更特别小。在一定的历史时期，我们仍然不能不使工业的发展速度快于农业的发展速度。在我国，这正是加快包括农业在内的整个国民经济的发展速度的一个必要的过程。在这过程中，工业的发展速度虽然要更快些，但农业和工业发展速度的距离正在缩短。缩短这个距离的正确方法，不是把工业的发展速度放慢，而是把农业的发展速度加快。也就是说，是积极的平衡，而不是消极的平衡。在社会主义制度下，工业和农业成为一个统一的国民经济整体，生产的目的是满足人们日益增长的物质文化生活的需要，国内市场总能容得下越来越多的生活资料，永远也不怕“生产过剩”。社会主义的基本经济规律决定了这一点，社会主义经济有计划按比例发展的规律也决定了这一点。
    在社会主义制度下，工业和农业既然还有本质的差别，就还有一定的矛盾。不过，这矛盾不再是对抗性的了，而且可以成为互相促进的动力。农业还不能充分满足工业发展的要求，工业也还不能充分满足农业发展的要求。两方面互相提出更高的要求，正是互相促进的表现形式之一。工业和农业的所有制在一定时期内是不同的，机械化的程度在一定时期是不同的，劳动生产率在一定时期内也是不同的；生产条件和受自然因素的影响也不相同，这个差别要延续更长的时间。这些差别必然会影响到发展速度的差别。但是，通过人的主观努力，速度的这种差别是可以缩小的。1950—1952年，工业总产值和农业总产值每年平均增长速度的比例是二点四七比一；大规模经济建设开始后，为了改变我国历史上遗留下来的工业十分薄弱的局面，工业发展速度大大加快，第一个五年计划期间工业总产值和农业总产值每年平均增长速度的比例改变为四比一；大跃进的1958年，在工业农业都有很大发展的情况下，两者的增长速度改变为二点六五比一；1959年，在工业和农业都继续跃进的情况下，两者增长速度改变为二点三五比一。由于自然方面的原因或者其他的原因，工业和农业的发展速度，今后也不一定准是一年比一年都更接近；但是，就总的发展趋势来说，在工业和农业的比重达到一定程度之后，它们的发展速度必将更加接近。在劳动生产率还没有提高到相当的高度的时候，工业农业之间在劳动力、技术力量、资金、原材料和设备的分配方面，难免会有各种具体的矛盾。但是，只要妥善地加以安排，这些矛盾都是能够解决的。这些矛盾决不至于妨碍工业和农业同时并举；相反，只有工业和农业同时并举，才能从根本上解决这些矛盾。
    以农业为基础，以工业为主导，决不是一个临时性的方针，而是一个根本的长远的方针。有人认为只是个别时期需要以工业为主导，重工业大大发展了之后，实现了国家工业化、农业机械化之后，就不必再优先发展重工业了。这是不对的。农业高度机械化以后，工业的主导作用不会缩小，而是势必更加增大。有人认为只是个别时期需要以农业为基础，农业大大发展之后，农业劳动生产率大为提高之后，就不需要再注意发展农业了。这也是不对的。生产要不断扩大，生活要逐步提高，人口要年年增加；将来，工业人口总是要增加的，生产工业原料的农业人口也总是要增加的。因此，农产品，首先是粮食，必须不断增加。在人力还不能完全控制自然的时候，在还不能保证粮食和其它农产品的产量每年都能稳定地大量增长的情况下，更要求尽一切可能增产各种农产品，特别是粮食，以便增加储备量。工业的主导作用越来越大，农业的基础作用也会越来越大。农业生产并不只是生产生活资料的；在农业产品中，生产资料的比重势必要越来越大。随着工业的发展，农业将要提供更多的工业原料，粮食也要有更多的部分成为工业原料。农业本身的发展也要求有更多的粮食和来自农业的生产资料。
    怎样进一步贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针呢？一方面，要加强农业本身的力量和充分发挥农业本身的力量；另方面，要动员工业方面和其他方面以更大的力量支援农业。
    必须不断调整、改进生产关系和上层建筑
    必须大大加强农业的领导力量和劳动力
    对于农业本身扩大再生产的力量必须有足够的估计。农业劳动生产率的更大幅度的提高固然要依靠工业的发展；但是，工业的发展却首先要依靠农业劳动生产率的提高。必须看到，农业本身蕴藏着提高劳动生产率的巨大潜力。生产关系和上层建筑的根本变革解放了这些潜力，生产关系和上层建筑进一步的局部调整和改进还可以继续解放这些潜力。列宁早就指出过，为了建设社会主义，为了改善人民生活，首先要增加粮食生产，也就是说首先要提高农民的生产力。他说：“应该从农民方面开始”，并且批评那些不懂这一点的人是一些“不去认真思考问题而陷于空谈”的人。（《列宁全集》第32卷，第332页）他又指出：“农业生产率的提高，必然促进我国工业的发展。”（《列宁全集》第33卷，第105页）我国的事实早已证明，在农业机械化实现以前，也可以而且必须实现农业合作化。随着生产关系的变革、群众觉悟的提高、耕作技术的改革、领导力量的加强以及工作方法的改进，农业的劳动生产率也能大大提高。决不能消极地等待农业机械化，而要充分动员广大群众，首先是农民群众本身的积极性主动性提高农业生产。这正是加速工业发展和争取早日实现农业机械化的必要条件。
    为了进一步发挥农业本身扩大再生产的力量，需要从几个方面扎扎实实地作重大的努力：一是继续巩固和发展人民公社，从经营管理、规章制度、劳动组织、政治工作、干部作风、工作方法等方面进行调整、改进和建设工作，也就是使生产关系和生产力更相适应、使上层建筑对基础起更大的促进作用。二是保证农业生产的主要战线有足够的主要劳动力。三是按照农业“八字宪法”更细致更科学地进行农艺和工具的改革。扩大再生产有两种方式：一种是技术条件不变的情况下的扩大再生产，主要靠劳动量的增加和劳动效率的提高，等等；一种是技术改进的情况下的扩大再生产，主要靠生产工具和技术的革新。这两种方式在实际生产中常是同时并行的。在我国目前的条件下，农业的扩大再生产，更有必要两种方式同时并举。为此，必须把足够的劳动力用在农业生产上，必须改进劳动力的组织和使用，也必须大搞技术革新和技术革命。这些，主要靠农业本身的力量。
    当前，贯彻执行以农业为基础这个战略方针的核心问题是劳动力的合理安排、正确使用。首先要在农业生产的第一线、特别是粮食生产战线集中最多最强的劳动力。从一个较长的历史时期来说，“农民——这是中国工人的前身。”要实现国家工业化，“就要有一个变农村人口为城市人口的长过程。”（《论联合政府》）要发展工业生产，从农村吸收一定的劳动力是必要的。农民是工人阶级的最可靠的同盟军，也是工人阶级的最强大的后备军。可是，必须注意，这里说的是“一个长过程”。农民向工人的转化，必须有一定的条件，必须在一定的计划下进行。任何行业从农业吸收劳动力的先决条件，是农业劳动生产率的提高。从农业方面吸收劳动力的数量质量和时间，必须同农业劳动生产率提高的程度、农产品总产量和需要量的状况相适应。这是一条非常重要的原则，非如此不足以保证整个国民经济的健康发展。在一定的时期，在某些情况下，工业和其他行业不但不能抽调农业劳动力，还要抽出一部分劳动力到农业方面去；同时，要用集中力量支援农业加速进行技术改造等方法，迅速地提高农业劳动生产率。这正是“将欲取之，必先与之”。要改变“五亿多人弄饭吃”的局面，要想从农业方面吸取劳动力，非先集中优势力量发展农业生产不可。在我国农业人口中，劳动力约占三分之一到五分之二；农业劳动生产率每增加1％，就能在保持农产品总量不变的情况下腾出一百多万到二百多万劳动力。这并不是说，每提高1％的农业劳动生产率，就可以从农业方面抽出同样比例的劳动力。在安排劳动力的时候，还要看到工业和农业的发展状况，首先是农业的状况。在目前情况下，即使增加一部分劳动生产率，也还是应该继续用于农业的扩大再生产，特别是粮食的扩大再生产。因为只是保持目前的农产品，特别是粮食的年产量是不行的，整个经济建设形势的发展要求农产品，特别是粮食年产量更多更快地提高。到农业劳动生产率提高到一定程度之后，再提高劳动生产率，就可以逐步地更多地转入工业生产，成为进一步发展工业生产的生力军。发展农业生产是全党全民的伟大的事业
    工业在支援农业中才能充分起主导作用
    同时还要认清，发展农业生产是全民的事业。今年4月，第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议正式通过全国农业发展纲要的时候，就对全国人民发出了这样的号召：“农业是国民经济的基础，提前实现全国农业发展纲要，对于我国社会主义建设的继续跃进具有极其重大的意义。大会号召：全国各族人民，工业、农业、交通、财政、金融、贸易、科学、教育、文化、卫生、体育等一切部门共同努力，为提前两年或三年实现全国农业发展纲要这个伟大的任务而奋斗！”在这个号召发出之后，全国各地就涌起了各行各业支援农业的春潮，并且创造了厂矿与农村公社挂钩、城市公社与农村公社挂钩等等工农加强联系的新形式。列宁曾经指出：“在城市工人与农村劳动者中间建立相互的联系，确定一种可以很容易建立起来的友好互助形式，这是我们的责任，这是执政的工人阶级的基本任务之一。”（《列宁全集》第33卷，第420页）这种友好互助形式，在我国可以说是已经开始建立起来了。
    大力支援农业，这决不是削弱工业，而是从一个极其重要的方面加强工业。工业的主导作用，正是要在以农业为基础的方针下才能充分发挥出来。1955年，毛泽东同志就指出过：“中国只有在社会经济制度方面彻底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观。”（《关于农业合作化问题》）1959年，又明确地指出：农业的根本出路在于机械化；并且提出了在十年内有步骤地加速实现农业技术改造的重大任务。在这方面，主要靠工业的力量。
    工业生产出来的生产资料有两类：一类是生产生产资料用的，一类是生产生活资料用的。生产生产资料的生产资料应该优先发展；同时，生产生活资料的生产资料也应该加速发展。在社会主义制度下，优先发展前一种生产资料的目的，正是为了更多更快地生产后一种生产资料，最后目的是为了更多生产生活资料；决不是说，优先发展前一种生产资料就可以忽视发展后一种生产资料。两种生产资料的生产也是可以同时并举、同时加速发展的；也只有这样做，才能实现优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合。只有用足够的力量发展农业用的生产资料，才能促进农业这个基础更加巩固，才能充分发挥工业的主导作用。试想，不增加农业用的生产资料，工业对什么地方起主导作用呢？
    工业要从农业方面取得人力、物力资源，也必须先以大量的生产资料支援农业。据黑龙江调查，一个劳动力使用农业机械进行农业生产，比使用旧式农具进行农业生产，劳动生产率提高一倍半以上，提供的商品粮食数量提高四倍多。又据一些地区调查，每个马力的动力机械发挥出来的力量，相当于四个到八个劳动力。化肥和厩肥配合使用，也能节约许多运肥、施肥的劳动力。这些是提高农业劳动生产率的最重要的门路。
    商业是工业农业之间的重要纽带，对于更好地执行以农业为基础、以工业为主导的方针能够起很大的促进作用和组织作用。许多地方商业部门的经验证明，掌握和适应农业生产的规律，在供应和采购工作的时间和方式上适合农业生产的需要，对于农业劳动生产率和农产品的商品率的提高有重大的作用。
    至于上层建筑的各部门，要为自己的经济基础服务，也必须首先为农业服务。一切工作的安排，必须注意农事季节，注意农业的特点；要同生产密切结合，而不可妨碍生产，脱离生产。非常明显，只有农业这个基础更巩固了，整个经济基础才能更加巩固。经济基础更加巩固了，上层建筑才能更好地发展。
    以农业为基础是一个重大的政治问题
    同总路线和工农联盟有极密切的关系
    要不要以农业为基础，要不要迅速发展农业，这不仅是个经济问题，同时也是个重大的政治问题，是要不要按照总路线办事的问题，要不要工农联盟的问题。毛泽东同志说：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发。”又说：“除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。”这一方面是指六亿人口的需要，更重要的一方面是指六亿人口的伟大的主观能动作用。在六亿人口中，有五亿多是农民。即使将来发展到工业人口农业人口各半，农业人口也还是几亿人。把几亿人民看作推动社会前进的伟大的动力呢？还是只看成被动的消极的因素呢？要不要把几亿人民的伟大力量动员起来积极地主动地参加社会主义建设呢？问题的本质就在这里。正如刘少奇同志代表中共中央在八大二次会议上作的政治报告中所说的：“为什么工业和农业必须同时并举呢？这是由于我国是一个农业的大国，在我国的六亿多人口中有五亿多农民，他们无论在革命斗争中和建设工作中都是一支最伟大的力量，我国工人阶级只有依靠这个伟大的同盟军，把他们的积极性和创造性充分地调动起来，才能取得胜利。农民同盟军问题的极端重要性，革命时期是这样，建设时期仍然是这样。”
    农业是国民经济的基础，工业是国民经济的主导，这是客观规律。以农业为基础，以工业为主导，这是党根据这个客观规律制定的方针。这个方针的实质，就是动员世界上最大的一支劳动大军来发展基本生活资料的生产，就是动员世界上最大的国内市场来促进数量巨大无比的重工业产品和轻工业产品的生产，就是动员我国工人阶级的力量支援农民更迅速地改变这个农业大国的农业面貌，并且在这过程中使工业更快地成长起来，就是动员几亿人民的力量和智慧参加高速度地建设一个伟大的现代化的社会主义国家的神圣事业。十余年来我国经济建设的伟大胜利的事实，已经充分证明了党的正确处理工业农业关系的方针的重大意义。这个方针反映了客观规律，同时也随着客观形势的发展而发展着。现在进一步确定和更加强调以农业为基础、以工业为主导的方针，这反映了客观形势发展的要求。广大农村人民公社日益巩固、健康发展，为发展农业生产和加强工农联系提供了最根本的有利条件；工业大跃进和持续跃进，迫切需要相应地增加农业生产，同时，也为对农业起主导作用提供了更有利的条件。粮食和其它农产品的产量几年来增长得很快；同时，国家建设和人民生活对粮食和其他农产品的需要量也大大增加了。这就要求更多更快地增产粮食和其他农产品。另方面，工业大跃进的结果也带来了更多更快地增产粮食和其他农产品的可能性。1958—1959年国家分配用于制造农业机械和农具方面的钢材，超过了第一个五年计划时期用在这方面的钢材的总和；1960年按照国家计划分配用于这方面的钢材，又比1959年增加了一倍左右。工业的其它部门支援农业的力量也增加了很多。总的经济形势是：社会主义建设正处于全面持续跃进的新阶段，工农联盟进入了加速实现农业现代化的新阶段。这是一个有重大意义的历史时期，是在我国加速建成社会主义和积极为建设共产主义准备条件的时期。进一步强调以农业为基础，以工业为主导，正是为了使人们的思想符合发展着的客观形势的要求。依靠人民公社的力量和国家工业的力量，坚决执行以农业为基础、以工业为主导的方针，必然会使整个社会主义经济建设更多更快更好更省地持续跃进，并且可以创造出必要的条件，在我国逐步实现马克思和恩格斯在《共产党宣言》中提出的伟大理想：“将农业同工业结合起来，促使城乡差别逐渐消失。”
