Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th. Eleven thousand Japanese representatives and one hundred and thirty foreign representatives attending the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Total Disarmament began group discussions this morning at Hosei University in Tokyo, divided into forty-six groups.

Whenever a speaker pointed out that U.S. imperialists are the most vicious enemies of world peace, and therefore the spearhead of the struggle should be accurately aimed at U.S. imperialism, there was a storm of applause expressing agreement.

The discussions focused on questions such as "Who are the enemies of peace? How are the enemies of peace preparing for nuclear war and infringing on national independence and destroying the lives of people of all countries?" On the basis of discussing these issues, the representatives participating in the group meetings discussed how to promote the peace movement and the goals the peace movement should achieve.

A worker from Tokyo strongly condemned U.S. imperialism in his speech. He said, "Workers have recognized who the enemy of peace is in the struggle against the 'Security Treaty'. They now realize that the enemy of peace is U.S. imperialism." He went on to say, "But U.S. imperialists are not as powerful as they seem. They are paper tigers. We have evidence to prove the weakness of U.S. imperialism, for example, we once forced President Eisenhower to abandon his visit to Japan, and we once forced the U.S. military authorities to postpone military exercises at the North Fuji base." He added, "We must recognize the great power we possess." He emphasized that the goal of the Japanese peace movement should now be to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

A worker from Niigata, Japan, spoke about the problems of Japanese farmers, emphasizing that workers should fully consider the problems faced by farmers in order to involve many farmers in the peace movement.

A miner from Hokkaido, Japan, said at a group meeting that he was deeply moved after listening to the speeches of representatives from China and Sudan on the 6th. He emphasized, "I fully agree with the following view expressed by these foreign representatives: Peace can only be defended when the people are aware of the true nature of the enemies of peace, condemn the enemies of peace, and fight against these enemies."

Many Japanese women, religious figures, and students also spoke at the group meetings.

A student from a school for the blind in Japan spoke about his own and other students' experiences in the struggle against the "Security Treaty," saying that although they are blind, they can still play a role in public life. He said movingly, "We have proved that we are useful in the struggle to defend peace." He emphasized, "We have clearly understood that the enemy that makes us suffer is the very enemy that makes workers, farmers, and all the people of Japan suffer."

A representative from Okinawa pointed out in his speech that it is necessary to force U.S. imperialism to withdraw its military bases in Japan. He said that if the Japanese people cannot victoriously force the United States to withdraw its military bases throughout Japan, it will be impossible to return Okinawa to Japan.

Foreign representatives participating in the group meetings also actively participated in the discussions.

    禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会开始小组讨论
    世界和平的头号敌人是美帝国主义  同和平敌人坚决斗争才能保卫和平
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：参加第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的一万一千名日本代表和一百三十名外国代表今天上午在东京法政大学分成四十六个小组开始讨论。
    每当发言的人指出美帝国主义者是世界和平的头号凶恶敌人、因而斗争的矛头应该准确地针对美帝国主义的时候，就响起了表示赞同的暴风雨般的掌声。
    讨论集中在“谁是和平的敌人？和平的敌人怎样在准备核战争和侵犯民族独立和破坏各国人民的生活？”等问题上。参加小组会议的代表们在讨论这些问题的基础上，讨论了怎样推动和平运动以及和平运动要达到的目标等问题。
    东京的一名工人在讲话中强烈谴责美帝国主义。他说，“工人们在反对‘安全条约’斗争中认清了谁是和平的敌人。他们现在认识到和平的敌人就是美帝国主义”。他接着说，“可是美帝国主义者并不像看起来那样强大。它是纸老虎。我们有证据证明美帝国主义的弱点，例如，我们曾经迫使艾森豪威尔总统放弃了他的访问日本之行，我们曾经迫使美国军事当局推迟了北富士基地的军事演习。”他又说，“我们必须认识到我们拥有的强大力量。”他强调指出，日本的和平运动的目标现在应该是争取废除日美“安全条约”。
    来自日本新澙的一名工人谈到日本农民问题时强调说，工人们应该充分考虑农民所面临的问题，以使许多农民投入和平运动。
    来自日本北海道的一名矿工在小组会议上说，他在6日听了中国和苏丹的代表的讲话以后深受感动。他强调指出，“我完全同意这些外国代表们所表示的下列看法：只有当人民觉悟到掌握和平的敌人的真正本质，谴责和平的敌人并且同这些敌人进行斗争时，才能保卫和平”。
    在小组会上发言的还有许多日本妇女、宗教界人士和学生。
    日本一所盲人学校的一位学生在讲话中谈到他自己和盲人学校中其他学生在反对“安全条约”的斗争中的经验时说，他们虽然是盲人，但是在公众生活中还是可以起作用的。他令人感动地说，“我们已经证明，我们对于保卫和平的斗争是有用处的”。他强调说，“我们已经清楚地懂得，使我们受痛苦的敌人，正是使工人、农民和日本的全体老百姓遭受苦难的敌人。”
    来自冲绳的一位代表在讲话时指出要迫使美帝国主义撤销它在日本的军事基地。他说，如果日本人民不能胜利地迫使美国撤销它在日本各地的军事基地，要使冲绳归还日本将是不可能的。
    参加小组会议的外国代表也积极参加了讨论。
