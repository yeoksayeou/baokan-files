Xinhua News Agency Report: Farmers in the cotton-producing areas of Shanxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Nantong Prefecture of Jiangsu, and the Hexi Corridor of Gansu are making every effort to strengthen cotton field management, striving to increase the number of summer and autumn bolls and improve cotton yield per unit area.

In Shanxi Province, leaders at all levels and the broad masses of commune members in cotton-producing areas have launched a cotton field management campaign centered on "water, fertilizer, and pest control" to ensure a bumper cotton harvest, focusing on protecting summer bolls and striving for autumn bolls. This year, the cotton seedlings in Shanxi Province are characterized by dense seedlings, early development, short internodes, uniform growth, and many pre-summer bolls, creating favorable conditions for striving for a bumper cotton harvest. Therefore, current cotton field management in various areas focuses on promoting the growth of more buds and bolls on cotton plants, preventing shedding, and increasing boll weight. In dry areas without rain, every possible means is being used to develop water sources, improve irrigation methods, expand the irrigated area, and apply fertilizer in multiple stages in conjunction with irrigation. In rainy areas and in waterlogged, semi-waterlogged, and low-lying cotton fields, efforts are being strengthened to carry out inter-row cultivation, weeding, fertilization, pruning, and pest control. According to statistics from July 25, two-thirds of the province's 4.2 million mu of cotton fields have been cultivated three times, more than half of the cotton fields have been fertilized three times, and irrigable cotton fields have been irrigated more than four times.

In Hunan Province, various cotton-producing areas have widely launched a large-scale balanced production increase campaign centered on increasing bud and boll protection, strengthening the cultivation and management of cotton, and striving for a bumper cotton harvest. Currently, in the province's more than 1.4 million mu of cotton fields, the original 30% or so of third-class seedlings have generally been upgraded, and the remaining first and second-class seedlings are robust and leafy, beginning to form bolls.

This year, due to the adoption of concentrated and contiguous management in Hunan Province's cotton fields, management work was grasped earlier, progressed faster, and was managed more carefully than in previous years, so cotton seedlings generally grew well, but cotton seedling growth is still unbalanced due to the large number of new cotton fields. At present, Hunan Province is carrying out a large-scale balanced production increase campaign centered on increasing bud and boll protection. In the large-scale balanced production increase campaign, various areas, in accordance with the spirit of focusing on key areas to drive general progress, have established large-scale, high-yield demonstration plots. Farmers in counties such as Li County and Huarong County have taken measures to lightly apply nitrogen fertilizer, supplemented with phosphate and potash fertilizer, and to delay closing the ridges and deep cultivate cotton fields with dense leafy branches to prevent the growth of superfluous buds, and have taken measures such as pruning side shoots and removing old leaves in stages to solve the problem of ventilation and light transmission in cotton plants. Communes and teams in Cili County have widely carried out production increase competition campaigns with high-yield demonstration plots as the center.

In Sichuan, all major cotton-producing areas have concentrated their superior labor force and put it into the front line of cotton field management. In recent days, Nanchong, Neijiang, Mianyang, Daxian and other prefectures have organized teams of millions of people to cooperate with professional cotton planting teams to vigorously grasp cotton field management. After seven days of concentrated efforts in Mianyang Prefecture, 85% of the 1.2 million mu of cotton fields have been cultivated and treated for pests, and the vast majority have rushed to apply boll-promoting fertilizer. Shehong County, last year's county with 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, recently launched a cotton field management crash program to catch up late-sown fields with early-sown fields and weak seedlings with strong seedlings, based on the actual situation that weak seedlings and late seedlings accounted for about 17% of the county's total. More than 190,000 people in the county were mobilized, and after five days of concentrated efforts, 70% of the weak seedlings and 80% of the late-sown cotton have changed their appearance; all 160,000 mu of cotton fields in the county have been cultivated, fertilized, and treated for pests three to four times.

Nantong Prefecture in Jiangsu Province is the prefecture with the longest history of cotton planting and the largest planting area. The vast majority of the 2.4 million mu of cotton planted in the prefecture this year is wheat intercropped cotton (that is, cotton intercropped in wheat fields before the wheat is harvested). In order to strengthen cotton field management, in the people's communes in the main cotton-producing areas, the first secretary is in charge of cotton; communes with less cotton planting area also have a secretary or standing committee member in charge of cotton. In the arrangement of labor, the method of separate lines and specialized management of grain and cotton is also adopted, and professional teams and groups for cotton field management are generally established and improved; arrangements have also been made for the fertilizer needed for topdressing cotton fields. At present, the proportion of first and second-class seedlings in the prefecture has risen rapidly, and the proportion of third-class seedlings is declining, and all cotton has begun to bud.

In the cotton-growing areas of the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province, a cotton field management campaign centered on combating summer drought, increasing budding, protecting bolls, and protecting summer bolls is being carried out, striving for a large-scale bumper cotton harvest. Now the cotton fields in the region have generally been weeded for the first time, of which about 80% of the cotton fields have been cultivated and thinned, and 20% of the cotton fields have been continuously cultivated twice. In addition, the whole region has dug wells and springs, intercepted river water, melted ice and snow, and rushed to irrigate more than 155,000 mu of cotton fields, and more than 91,000 mu have been fertilized in conjunction with irrigation. Cotton fields with pests such as aphids, cutworms, and red spiders have also been sprayed with pesticides one to three times for prevention and treatment. (Attached pictures)

    加强棉田管理　多结伏桃秋桃
    本报讯　综合新华社消息：山西、湖南、四川和江苏南通专区、甘肃河西走廊棉区农民，正在千方百计加强棉田管理，力争多结伏桃和秋桃，提高棉花单位面积产量。
    山西省产棉区各级领导和广大社员为了确保棉田丰产，展开了以“水、肥、治虫”为中心的保伏桃、争秋桃棉田管理运动。山西省今年棉苗生长特点是：留苗密、发育早、节间短、生长匀称、伏前桃多，为力争棉花大丰收创造了有利条件。因此，各地在当前的棉田管理上都紧抓促进棉株多长蕾铃、防止脱落和增加铃重等措施。在干旱未雨的地区，正想尽一切办法开辟水源，改进浇水方法，扩大浇地面积，并结合浇水分期多次追施肥料。在落雨地区和水地、半水地、下湿地的棉田，正在加强中耕除草、追肥、整枝和治虫。据7月25日统计，全省四百二十万亩棉田，已有三分之二的面积中耕过三遍，有半数以上的棉田追过三次肥，能浇水的棉田都浇过四水以上。
    湖南省各产棉地区广泛掀起以增蕾保桃为中心的大面积平衡增产运动，加强对棉花的培育管理，争取棉花大丰收。目前全省一百四十多万亩棉田中，原有的30％左右的三类苗，已普遍升级，其余的一、二类苗，都是苗壮叶茂，开始结桃。
    今年湖南省的棉田由于采取集中连片经营，管理工作比往年抓得早，进度快，管得精细，因此棉苗普遍生长良好，但由于新棉田多，棉苗生长仍不平衡。目前，湖南全省开展了以增蕾保桃为中心的大面积平衡增产运动。在大面积平衡增产运动中，各地按照狠抓重点，带动一般的精神，建立了大面积高额丰产片。澧县、华容等县农民对叶枝密茂的棉田采取轻施氮肥，配合磷钾肥，以及晚封垅，深中耕的办法，防止了生长赘芽，并采取分次打旁心剪空枝、打老叶等办法，解决了棉花通风透光问题。慈利县各社、队以丰产片为中心，广泛开展了增产竞赛运动。
    四川各主要产棉区都纷纷集中优势劳力，投入棉田管理第一线。南充、内江、绵阳、达县等专区，近日来分别组织上百万人的队伍，配合植棉专业队，狠抓棉田管理。绵阳专区经过七天突击，一百二十万亩棉田中，已有85％进行了中耕和治虫，绝大部分抢施了催桃肥。去年的皮棉百斤县——射洪县，根据全县弱苗、迟苗约占17％的实际情况，最近开展了迟播田赶早播田、弱苗赶壮苗的棉田管理突击运动，全县出动十九万多人，经过五天突击，已有70％的弱苗和80％的迟播棉变了样；全县十六万亩棉田都已中耕、追肥、治虫三至四次。
    江苏省南通专区是植棉历史最老、种植面积最大的专区。全区今年种植的二百四十多万亩棉花，绝大部分是麦套棉（即在麦子未收时在麦地里套种的棉花）。为了加强棉花田间管理工作，在主要棉产区的人民公社，由第一书记挂帅抓棉花；棉花种植面积较少的公社，也有一个书记或常委专管棉花。在劳动力的安排上，也采取粮、棉分线专业专管的办法，普遍建立和健全了棉花田间管理专业队、专业组；对棉田追肥所需要的肥料也作了安排。目前，全区一、二类苗的比重迅速上升，三类苗所占比重正在下降，全部棉花都已开始现蕾。
    甘肃省河西走廊各植棉地区，开展以抗夏旱增蕾保铃保桃为中心的棉田管理运动，力争棉花大面积丰收。现在全区棉田已普遍锄过头遍草，其中约80％的棉田已中耕定苗，20％的棉田连续进行二次中耕。此外，全区掏井挖泉，截引河水，融冰化雪抢洪灌溉棉田十五万五千多亩，有九万一千多亩结合浇水追了肥。对发生棉蚜、地老虎、红蜘蛛等虫害的棉田也普遍喷药一至三次进行防治。（附图片）
