Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: Qinhuangdao Port and Station, pioneers of port-rail coordination, have fully utilized the method of "matching trains and ships, no goods landing." Recently, without increasing manpower or equipment, they have more than doubled the port's transport volume and greatly shortened the coal transportation time.

Previously, Qinhuangdao Port had occasionally used the "matching trains and ships, no goods landing" method, but it was not frequent enough, and the effect was not significant enough. Recently, in order to speed up coal transportation, most of the coal is transported using this method. The method they use is: the port actively contacts the station, coal mine, and cargo users, and learns in detail in advance the quantity of goods to be transported each day, the arrival and delivery times, and makes the plan and transportation organization work very detailed and specific. The dispatching room jointly composed of the port and the station uniformly dispatches vehicles and ships so that the arrival time of the train is exactly the time when the ship enters the dock. After the freight car arrives at the station, it can directly enter the dock, and the goods can be directly unloaded from the train into the hold. In this way, it is not necessary to unload the goods from the train to the port authority's storage yard first, and then wait for the ship to arrive before loading the goods into the port authority's specially prepared vehicles and transporting them to the dock to load into the hold. The benefit of matching trains and ships and not landing goods is that it can shorten the transportation process of goods, save loading and unloading manpower, and increase port transportation capacity.

Since Qinhuangdao Port began to use the "matching trains and ships, no goods landing" method on a large scale on August 6, it has saved the transportation time and labor of one loading and one unloading operation in the port's freight yard. It also freed up a large number of loading and unloading workers from the freight yard to concentrate on the dock, which suddenly doubled the dock's ship loading and unloading strength and transportation capacity. In the past, this dock could only load and unload two or three ships at the same time, but now it can load and unload six ships at the same time. In just one week from August 8 to 13, more than 100,000 tons of coal were transported in addition to the original plan, and the coal transportation time was also greatly shortened.

When Qinhuangdao Port created this new experience, leading cadres of the Party, government, trade union, and the Communist Youth League all went to the dock to guide the work, and the vehicle and ship dispatchers and planning statisticians all moved to the dock to work. Therefore, they were able to solve key problems in a timely manner, make labor allocation flexible and mobile, and make planning and statistical work detailed and specific.

### 秦皇岛路港协作又有新发展  车船对口　运量倍增

    秦皇岛路港协作又有新发展
    车船对口　运量倍增
    据新华社天津讯　首创路港协作经验的秦皇岛港和车站，充分运用“车船对口、货不落地”的办法，最近在没有增加人力和设备的情况下，使港口的运输量猛增一倍，煤的运输时间也缩短了很多。
    在这之前，秦皇岛港也曾偶尔采用“车船对口，货不落地”的办法，但不够经常，效果还不够显著。最近一个时期，为了加快煤的运输，大部分煤都采用这种办法运送。他们采用的办法是：港口主动和车站、煤矿、用货单位联系，事先详细了解每天需要运送的货物数量、到达和发货的时间，把计划和运输组织工作做得非常细致具体，并且由港口和车站联合组成的调度室统一调度车辆和船舶，使火车到达的时间刚好也是船只驶进码头的时间。货车到达车站以后，可以直接开进码头，货物能直接从火车上卸入船舱。这样就不必像过去那样，先把货物从火车上卸到港务局的堆货场，然后等船舶到达时，再把货物装进港务局特备的车辆，再运到码头装进船舱。车船对口、货不落地的好处是，可以缩短货物的运输过程，节省装卸人力，增加港口运输能力。
    秦皇岛港从8月6日开始大量采用“车船对口，货不落地”办法以后，省去了在港口货场一装一卸的运输作业时间和劳动力，又把货场腾出来的大批装卸工人集中到码头使用，顿时使码头的装船卸货力量和运输力突增一倍。过去这个码头只能同时装卸两三条船，现在可以同时装卸六条船。从8日到13日短短一个星期内，就在原定计划之外，多运了十多万吨煤，煤的运送时间也缩短了很多。
    秦皇岛港在创造这一新的经验时，党政工团领导干部全部出动到码头指导工作，车船调度人员、计划统计人员全部搬到码头办公，因此能及时解决关键问题，使劳动力调配灵活机动，计划、统计工作做得细致具体。
