Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th: The United States Department of State Spokesman has issued statements regarding the situation in Laos twice within three days, making blatant threats against the new Laotian regime and spreading the rumor that the situation in Laos "remains chaotic," attempting to prepare the ground for the US to instigate rebellions by reactionaries of the old regime and directly intervene in Laos.

    State Department spokesman White, when discussing the situation in Laos on the 18th, clamored that the "political situation remains chaotic" in Laos, and attempted to threaten the new Laotian regime by suspending so-called American "aid," saying that the United States "cannot yet finally decide whether it will continue to provide economic and military assistance to that country." White also said that the Lao "situation is not clear enough to allow the United States to draw any conclusions on (how the current situation affects American policy)."

    Prior to this, the US Department of State spokesman announced in a statement on the 16th that the US government "continues to recognize the old government of Laos."

    美国公然威胁老挝新政府
    新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人三天内两次就老挝局势发表谈话，对老挝新政权发出露骨的威胁，并且散布老挝局势“仍然混乱”的谰言，企图为美国策动旧政权的反动分子进行暴乱和直接出面干涉老挝作准备。
    国务院发言人怀特18日在谈到老挝情况时扬言老挝的“政治局势仍然很混乱”，并且企图以中断美国的所谓“援助”来威胁老挝新政权，他说美国现在还“不能最后决定是否将继续向这个国家提供经济和军事援助”。怀特还说，老挝“局势还并不清楚得足以使美国就（目前局势对美国政策有怎样的影响）这个问题得出任何结论”。
    在这以前，美国国务院发言人在16日发表的谈话中曾经宣布美国政府“继续承认老挝旧政府”。
