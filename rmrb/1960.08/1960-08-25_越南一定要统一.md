    Vietnam Must Be Unified
    Senior Colonel He Wenlou, Head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army
    In 1950, just as French imperialism was deeply mired in the "dirty war" of aggression against Indochina, the United States imperialism, frightened by the victory of the Chinese revolution, poured large amounts of dollars and weapons into the Indochina battlefield. While this was intended to encourage the defeated French colonialists, its fundamental plan was to interfere in the Indochina war by supporting the French colonialists, so as to gradually squeeze them out and seize Indochina for itself, using the region as a springboard for launching attacks against the People's Republic of China from the south.
    From 1950 to 1954, US imperialism spent 2.6 billion US dollars and 400,000 tons of weapons in the Indochina war of aggression, but it still could not stop the Vietnamese people from advancing from victory to victory.
    When French imperialism was besieged by the Vietnam People's Army at Dien Bien Phu, US imperialism hastily dispatched aircraft carriers from Manila to the Indochina coast; sixty B29 heavy bombers, each capable of carrying 450 tons of bombs, were ready to fly from Manila to Dien Bien Phu to drop bombs. But the Vietnamese people still resolutely carried out their heroic struggle. Under the increasingly strong opposition from peace-loving people around the world, British and French imperialism did not dare to join forces with US imperialism to form a Southeast Asia military alliance to expand the Indochina war of aggression. Therefore, US imperialism was isolated and forced to agree to hold the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue. Everyone remembers that this conference was held the day after the Vietnam People's Army achieved a brilliant victory on the Dien Bien Phu battlefield. American warmongers used every means to undermine the success of the conference. But in the end, their sinister plot to prolong and expand the Indochina war of aggression failed miserably.
    The Geneva Accords were signed on July 20, 1954, restoring peace in Indochina on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, including independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. US imperialism was also forced to declare at the Geneva Conference that the United States would not use threats or force to obstruct the implementation of the agreements that had been concluded.
    Regarding the Vietnam issue, the final declaration of the Geneva Conference stated, "In order to ensure that the restoration of peace makes sufficient progress and that all necessary conditions for the free expression of national will are met, general elections will be held in July 1956 under the supervision of the International Commission composed of representatives of the member states of the International Supervisory and Control Commission stipulated in the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities. From July 20, 1955, the responsible authorities with representation from both regions should consult on this issue." The Geneva Accords affirmed that "the military demarcation line is a provisional line and should under no circumstances be interpreted as a political or territorial boundary." Many provisions of the Geneva Accords concerning military and people's rights and freedoms do not allow any foreign interference in Vietnam's internal affairs; prohibit the introduction of foreign troops and military personnel as well as various weapons and ammunition into Vietnam; prohibit the establishment of new military bases throughout Vietnam; stipulate that no participation in any foreign military alliances is allowed to ensure the prevention of the recurrence of hostilities; and also stipulate guarantees for the democratic freedoms of individuals and groups, and no retaliation or discrimination because of their activities during the period of hostilities.
    From the above, it can be seen that the Geneva Accords were a peaceful agreement. Therefore, it was opposed from the very beginning by the enemies of peace—the forces of war and aggression of US imperialism. After the failure of US imperialism's plot to obstruct the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement, it immediately prepared to sabotage the implementation of the Geneva Accords. The head of US imperialism, Eisenhower, issued a statement the day after the signing of the agreement that "the United States is not bound by the various agreements of the Geneva Conference." This is one of the clear evidences of US imperialism's attempt to sabotage the Geneva Accords.
    An important step taken by US imperialism to sabotage the Geneva Accords was to establish a puppet regime in South Vietnam, and through the puppet regime, eliminate and replace the French colonial forces, turning South Vietnam into a US colony and military base. Two weeks before the signing of the Geneva Accords, the United States sent Ngo Dinh Diem, a dog it had been raising and training for four years, back to South Vietnam to establish a puppet regime.
    For six years since the armistice, US imperialism and its lackey Ngo Dinh Diem have become increasingly blatant in opposing the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and undermining the independence and security of Southeast Asian countries. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique has repeatedly refused to consult with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the issue of free general elections, and has rejected a series of proposals from the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the restoration of normal relations between the northern and southern regions of Vietnam, the exchange of mail, and allowing women and children from the northern and southern regions to visit each other.
    Not long ago, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique established a so-called "Special Committee for Unifying the Territory and Liberating the North" in the puppet National Assembly, putting forward a very obvious and extremely reactionary proposition. They claimed that "if there is no unification, then so be it, but if unification is to occur, the current political system in the North must be abolished"; unification, for them, means "recovering the lost half of the northern land"... See how closely the rhetoric of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique matches the aggressive schemes of its master, US imperialism! In fact, the traitorous stance of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has long been known to all. When Ngo Dinh Diem went to the United States in May 1957 to beg his master for "aid," he shamelessly and openly declared: "The borders of the United States have extended to the 17th parallel in Vietnam."
    For six years, the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have wantonly violated the Geneva Accords concerning Vietnam, threatening peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. According to incomplete statistics, in the past six years, the United States has illegally shipped hundreds of thousands of tons of new weapons and war materials into South Vietnam. The United States is also preparing conditions for the planned introduction of atomic and rocket weapons. More than 2,000 American military advisors and military personnel, disguised as the "United States Military Assistance Advisory Group," constitute the US command in South Vietnam, directly directing all military activities in South Vietnam. The number of newly built and expanded military airports, large and small, in South Vietnam has reached 46, six of which are exclusively for jet aircraft; eleven military ports have been built. A series of strategic highways built by the United States in South Vietnam not only connect the aforementioned military bases but also run through southern Laos and connect with US military bases in Thailand. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique has never concealed its intention to formally join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, an aggressive organization. Through collusion with this aggressive organization and bilateral agreements signed with its member states or "protected" countries, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is turning South Vietnam into the organization's ninth member.
    Recently, US imperialism has further promoted its plan for military expansion and war preparations in South Vietnam. The United States openly dispatched part of its air force to South Vietnam to carry out conspiracies, and transferred warships to South Vietnam to strengthen Ngo Dinh Diem's naval forces. According to US news agencies, the US Department of Defense does not deny that they have prepared operational plans for Southeast Asia. These war preparation plans not only include the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, but also "consider" South Vietnam. US imperialism is trying its best to distort the content of the Geneva Accords and strengthen its war of aggression in South Vietnam. Under the pretext of replacing weapons taken away by the French aggressor troops who should have and have long been forced to withdraw from Vietnam, it has shipped large quantities of new weapons into South Vietnam; under the pretext of replacing French military personnel who should have and have already withdrawn from South Vietnam, it has shipped large numbers of US military personnel into South Vietnam, strengthening the forces of the illegally existing "United States Military Assistance Advisory Group." This is a new act of aggression by US imperialism. It paves the way for the United States to more crudely interfere in and more openly occupy South Vietnam.
    The vicious schemes of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique fundamentally violate the Vietnamese people's desire for peace, unification, independence, and democracy, and therefore have naturally encountered fierce resistance from the Vietnamese people, especially the people of South Vietnam. The US-Ngo clique has intensified its brutal suppression measures, attempting to eliminate the patriotic and progressive forces in South Vietnam in order to save their reactionary and corrupt rule. Ngo Dinh Diem openly said, "Don't be afraid of getting your hands dirty when you're in politics." What he meant was that he could unscrupulously use all despicable and brutal means to launch attacks against the people. Especially after the shocking political poisoning case at the Phu Loi concentration camp at the end of 1958, the US-Ngo clique dispatched regular troops in divisions to conduct sweeps, sometimes equipped with heavy artillery and bombers, bombing and strafing all day long. And those Black Shirt and Flower Shirt units, who called themselves "the most brutal in Indochina," used unprecedentedly barbaric and cruel methods to deal with South Vietnamese patriots: cutting off ears, cutting off noses, gouging out hearts and livers, beheading, and even publicly disemboweling. Last year, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique also promulgated "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959." This thoroughgoing fascist ordinance stipulated the establishment of special military tribunals. Special military tribunals can conduct roving trials and "execute on the spot" throughout South Vietnam. Its judgments only have two options: "life imprisonment with hard labor and the death penalty." Those being "tried" are not allowed to appeal. The US-Ngo clique, in the 20th century, when the consciousness of the broad masses of the people is increasing and their strength is growing, dares to implement this extremely brutal criminal law system that only appeared in the darkest medieval ecclesiastical courts, which also shows that the US-Ngo clique has reached the end of its road and is carrying out a desperate and frantic struggle.
    According to incomplete statistics, since the armistice, more than 14,800 people have been killed by the US-Ngo clique, and more than 230,000 have been imprisoned, tens of thousands of whom have been severely tortured and disabled. Those who have been imprisoned in villages everywhere and forcibly concentrated in so-called "dense areas," "dense villages," and "reclamation areas," etc., are not included in the above numbers. Some people compare South Vietnam to a large prison, and this is not an overstatement. Although peace has been restored, the US-Ngo clique has never stopped its frenzied attacks on the people of South Vietnam for six years, deliberately creating a "state of war." In South Vietnam, on average, one in every ten people has been subjected to the bloody persecution of the US-Ngo clique, and one in every three households has experienced the misfortune of being brutally suppressed. Imprisonment, injury, and some entire families have been wiped out, leaving no one alive, from newborns to the elderly. Now, the US-Ngo clique is forcing the people of South Vietnam to have their photos taken with numbered plaques, preparing to paste them on "identity cards." This is simply the same method used by French imperialism to treat prisoners when it ruled Vietnam.
    It is extremely regrettable that the International Commission for Vietnam, which is responsible for monitoring and supervising the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, recently disregarded the opposition of the Polish representative and, using the pretext of a majority vote, approved erroneous resolutions that allow the "United States Military Assistance Advisory Group" to remain in South Vietnam, illegally import military personnel and weapons, and consider that "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959" promulgated by the South Vietnamese authorities is unrelated to the Geneva Accords. These erroneous resolutions completely violate the provisions and spirit of the Geneva Accords and can only pave the way for the US-Ngo clique to further strengthen its war preparations and suppress the people's criminal activities in South Vietnam.
    In order to cover up their heinous crimes, the US-Ngo clique falsely accuses the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of violating the Geneva Accords and creating a "state of war"... attempting to deceive world public opinion with this fabricated rumor and slander. However, all of this is in vain. The US-Ngo clique does not understand that the large-scale military expansion and war preparation activities they are carrying out in South Vietnam, the continuous "sweeps" they are launching against the people, and the atrocities of killing people everywhere are the most powerful accusations themselves. This cannot be concealed by any deceptive propaganda.
    The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently been loyal to the deep desire of all the Vietnamese people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and has strictly implemented all the provisions of the Geneva Accords for six years. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is determined to work together with all the Vietnamese people to complete the national democratic revolution throughout the country, to ensure that North Vietnam, as the solid foundation for the realization of national unification, advances along the broad road of socialism. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is determined to resolutely fight for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords and for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and to contribute its strength to safeguarding peace in Southeast Asia and the world.
    For six years, the people of South Vietnam, under the guns of the US-Ngo clique, have fully utilized various open and legal forms to carry out political struggles. Recently, due to the intensified suppression by the US-Ngo clique, the people of South Vietnam have been driven to a dead end, and this struggle has become more acute and intense. The people of South Vietnam are bravely carrying out unyielding struggles against the US-Ngo clique's forced conscription, forced labor, forced relocation, opposition to the expansion of strategic highways and military bases, and opposition to "dense areas" and "reclamation areas." Whether in rural or urban areas, plains or mountainous regions, a patriotic movement with the broad participation of people from all strata, including workers, peasants, urban poor, students, intellectuals, and national bourgeoisie, is rising, and the united front against the US-Ngo clique is constantly being consolidated and developed.
    The Vietnamese people's struggle for peaceful reunification and the South Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence and democratic freedom are taking place in an era when the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind. Today, the domestic and international situation is very favorable to us. Although there will be many difficulties and setbacks in the future struggles, we firmly believe that through continuous struggles, the Vietnamese people will surely be able to shatter the war policy and aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism, destroy the fascist dictatorial rule of the US-Ngo clique in South Vietnam, and drive US imperialism out of South Vietnam. The Geneva Accords must be implemented! Vietnam must be unified!

    越南一定要统一
    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长　何文楼大校
    1950年，正当法帝国主义深深地陷在侵略印度支那的“肮脏战争”的泥沼中不能自拔的时候，被中国革命的胜利吓慌了的美帝国主义，把大批美元和武器源源投入印度支那战场。美帝国主义这样做，固然是为遭到惨败的法国殖民主义者打气，但它最根本的打算却在：通过对法国殖民者的支持，干涉印度支那战争，以便逐步排挤法国殖民者而把印度支那据为己有，并把这一地区作为它从南面向中华人民共和国发动进攻的跳板。
    1950年到1954年间，美帝国主义在印度支那的侵略战争中曾经花费了二十六亿美元和四十万吨武器，但毕竟不能阻止越南人民从胜利走向胜利。
    当法帝国主义被越南人民军团团围困在奠边府战场时，美帝国主义把航空母舰匆匆从马尼拉调到印度支那海岸；每次可以载运四百五十吨炸弹的六十架B29型重轰炸机，随时准备从马尼拉飞往奠边府战场投弹。但是越南人民仍然坚决进行英勇的斗争。在世界爱好和平人民日益强烈的反对下，英法帝国主义一时不敢同美帝国主义合伙纠集东南亚军事联盟，来扩大印度支那的侵略战争。因此美帝国主义陷于孤立，被迫同意举行关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议。大家还记得，这个会议正是在越南人民军在奠边府战场上取得辉煌胜利的第二天召开的。美国好战分子用尽一切手段破坏会议的成功。但最后，他们企图延长和扩大印度支那侵略战争的险恶阴谋，终于可耻地失败了。
    日内瓦协议签订于1954年7月20日，在承认越南、柬埔寨、老挝三国人民的独立、主权、统一和领土完整等民族权利的基础上，恢复了印度支那的和平。美帝国主义也被迫在日内瓦会议上声明：美国将不使用威胁或武力去妨害已经缔结的各项协定的履行。
    关于越南问题，日内瓦会议的最后宣言声明，“为使和平的恢复得到足够的进展，并为使自由表现民族意志的一切必要条件得以具备，将在1956年7月内，在停止敌对行动协定中所规定的国际监督和监察委员会成员国代表所组成的国际委员会的监督下举行普选。自1955年7月20日起，双方地区有代表性的负责当局，应就此项问题进行协商。”日内瓦协议确认“军事分界线是临时性的界线，无论如何不能被解释为政治的或领土的边界。”日内瓦协议的许多有关军事和人民自由权利的条款，不准许任何外国对越南的内部事务进行干涉；禁止向越南运入外国军队和军事人员以及各种武器和弹药，禁止在越南全境建立新的军事基地，规定不得参加任何外国军事同盟，以保证防止敌对行动的再起；并且还规定保障个人和团体的民主自由，不因其在敌对行动期间的活动而加以任何报复和歧视。
    从以上内容可以看出，日内瓦协议是一项和平的协议。因而一开始就遭到和平的敌人——美帝国主义战争和侵略势力的破坏。美帝国主义阻挠日内瓦会议达成协议的阴谋破产之后，立即准备破坏日内瓦协议的履行。美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔在协议签订的第二天，就发表声明“美国不受日内瓦会议的各项协议的约束”。这是美帝国主义企图对日内瓦协议进行破坏的明证之一。
    美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协议的一个重要步骤就是，在越南南方建立傀儡政权，并且通过傀儡政权排除和取代法国殖民势力，把越南南方建成为美国的殖民地和军事基地。美国在日内瓦协议签订前两星期，就把它已豢养和训练了四年的走狗吴庭艳送回越南南方，建立傀儡政权。
    停战六年来，美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳，越来越明目张胆地反对越南人民的和平统一事业，破坏东南亚各国的独立和安全。吴庭艳集团一再拒绝同越南民主共和国政府就自由普选问题进行协商，拒绝了越南民主共和国政府关于恢复越南北南两个地区的正常关系、关于交换邮件、关于允许北南两个地区的妇女儿童互相往来探望等一系列的建议。
    不久以前，吴庭艳集团在傀儡国会中成立了一个所谓“统一领土和解放北方特别委员会”，提出一项十分明显的极端反动的主张。说什么“不统一则已，如果要统一，就必须废除北方现行的政治制度”；统一对于他们来说，就是意味着“收复丧失的一半北方土地”……。请看，吴庭艳集团的论调，同它的主子美帝国主义的侵略阴谋是何等地吻合！其实，吴庭艳集团的卖国立场，久已为人所周知了。吴庭艳在1957年5月去美国乞求主子“援助”的时候，就曾恬不知耻地公开声称：“美国的边界已经伸延到越南的十七度纬线。”
    六年来，美国和吴庭艳集团恣意破坏有关越南的日内瓦协议，威胁印度支那和东南亚的和平。据不完全的统计，六年来，美国非法运入越南南方的新式武器和战争物资已达几十万吨。美国还正在为计划运入原子和火箭武器准备条件。以“美国军事援助顾问团”作为伪装的二千多名美国军事顾问和军事人员构成了美国在越南南方的司令部，直接指挥越南南方的一切军事活动。越南南方新建和扩建的大小军用机场达到四十六个，其中六个专供喷气机使用；修建的军港有十一个。美国在越南南方所修建的一系列战略公路不仅把上述的军事基地连成一气，而且还贯穿老挝南部地区同美国在泰国的军事基地相连接。对于东南亚条约侵略组织，吴庭艳集团也从不掩饰它正式加入的企图。吴庭艳集团通过同这个侵略组织的勾结，以及同它的成员国或受“保护”国家签订的双边协定，正在使南越变成这个组织的第九个成员。
    最近，美帝国主义在越南南方进一步推行它的扩军备战的计划。美国公开派遣一部分空军到越南南方进行阴谋活动；把战舰调到越南南方加强吴庭艳的海军力量。根据美国通讯社透露，美国国防部并不讳言他们已准备好了东南亚的作战计划。这些备战计划不仅包括东南亚条约侵略组织，而且把越南南方也“考虑”在内。美帝国主义竭力歪曲日内瓦协议的内容，加强它在越南南方的侵略战争势力。它们以替换应该和早已被迫撤出越南的法国侵略军所带走的武器为借口，把大批新的武器运入越南南方；以代替应该和已经撤出越南南方的法国军事人员为借口，把大批美国军事人员运入越南南方，加强非法存在的“美国军事援助顾问团”的力量。这是美帝国主义新的侵略行为。它为美国更加粗暴地干涉和更加露骨地霸占越南南方开辟道路。
    美国和吴庭艳集团的恶毒阴谋根本违背了越南人民要求和平、统一、独立和民主的愿望，因而很自然地遭到越南人民特别是越南南方人民的激烈反抗。美吴集团加紧采取野蛮的镇压手段，企图消灭越南南方的爱国进步力量，来挽救他们的反动腐朽统治。吴庭艳公开说过“搞政治就别怕手脏”。意思就是说，可以肆无忌惮地不惜使用一切卑鄙残暴手段，向人民发动进攻。尤其是在1958年底、骇人听闻的富利集中营政治毒杀案发生以后，美吴集团派遣了成师团的正规军进行扫荡，有时还配备重炮和轰炸机，整天轰炸扫射。而那些自称为“印度支那最残暴的”黑衫队和花格衫队，他们对付越南南方爱国者的手段之野蛮残酷，更是前所未闻：割耳朵、割鼻子、掏心肝、砍头甚至当众剖腹。去年，吴庭艳集团又颁布了“1959年第十号法令”。这个彻头彻尾的法西斯法令规定成立特别军事法庭。特别军事法庭可以在越南南方全境进行巡回和“就地处决”。它的判决只有“终生苦役和死刑”两种。被“审判”者并且不得上诉。美吴集团在广大人民觉悟日益提高、力量日益壮大的二十世纪的今天，竟敢施行这种只有在最黑暗的中世纪的教会法庭才出现过的极其残暴的刑法制度，也说明美吴集团已经走上了穷途末路，正在进行垂死的疯狂挣扎了。
    据不完全的统计，停战以来，遭到美吴集团杀害的有一万四千八百多人，被囚禁的达到二十三万人以上，其中数以万计的人被严刑拷打，成为残废。那些被囚禁在各地村庄以及被强迫集中在所谓“稠密区”、“稠密寨”、“垦荒区”等变相集中营的人们，还没有包括在内。有人把越南南方比作一座大监狱，这话并不过分。尽管和平已经恢复，但六年来美吴集团从不曾停止对越南南方人民的疯狂进攻，蓄意制造“战争状态”。在越南南方，平均每十个人中间就有一个人受到美吴集团的血腥迫害，每三户人家就有一户发生过遭遇残酷镇压的不幸事件。囚禁、伤害，有的全家都给杀得精光，从初生婴儿到风烛残年的老人，一个也不留。现在，美吴集团又在强迫越南南方人民拍摄挂有号码牌子的相片，准备贴在“身份证”上。这简直无异于当年法帝国主义统治越南时对待囚犯的办法。
    令人十分遗憾的是，负责监察和监督日内瓦协议在越南的实施的越南国际委员会，最近不顾波兰代表的反对，竟以多数通过为借口准许“美国军事援助顾问团”驻留越南南方、非法运入军事人员和武器，以及认为南越当局颁布的“1959年第十号法令”同日内瓦协议无关等错误决议。这些错误的决议完全违反了日内瓦协议的条款和精神，只能给美吴集团在越南南方进一步加强备战和镇压人民的罪恶活动铺平道路。
    美吴集团为了掩盖它们的滔天罪行，反诬越南民主共和国破坏日内瓦协议，制造“战争状态”……；企图以这种无中生有的造谣、诬蔑来欺骗世界舆论。然而这全都是枉费心机。美吴集团不了解：它们在越南南方大规模进行的扩军备战活动，不断对人民发动的“扫荡”以及到处残杀人民的暴行本身，就是最强有力的控诉。这是任何欺骗宣传也掩盖不了的。
    越南民主共和国政府一贯忠诚于全体越南人民和平统一祖国的深切愿望，六年来严正地履行日内瓦协议的一切条款。越南民主共和国政府决心和全体越南人民一起，为完成全国范围内的民族民主革命、为保证作为实现国家统一的牢固基础的越南北方沿着社会主义康庄大道前进而奋斗。越南民主共和国政府决心为日内瓦协议的彻底实现、为越南的和平统一而坚决进行斗争，为维护东南亚和世界的和平贡献出自己的力量。
    越南南方人民，六年来在美吴集团的枪口下，充分利用各种公开合法的形式进行了政治斗争。最近以来，由于美吴集团的加紧镇压，逼得越南南方人民无路可走，这一斗争已变得更为尖锐和激烈。越南南方人民为反对美吴集团强迫当兵、拉伕，为反对强迫迁居，反对扩建战略公路和军事基地，反对“稠密区”、“垦荒区”，正在勇敢地进行着不屈不挠的斗争。不论是在农村或是城市，平原或是山区，一个有着工农群众、城市贫民、学生、知识分子和民族资产阶级等各阶层人民广泛参加的爱国运动日益高涨，反对美吴集团的统一战线正在不断地巩固和发展。
    越南人民争取和平统一的斗争，越南南方人民掀起的争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争，发生在东风继续压倒西风的时代。今天，国内外形势对我们都非常有利。尽管今后的斗争还会碰到不少困难曲折，但我们坚信，越南人民通过持续不断的斗争，一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略阴谋，一定能够摧毁美吴集团在越南南方的法西斯独裁统治，一定能够把美帝国主义赶出越南南方。日内瓦协议一定要履行！越南一定要统一！
