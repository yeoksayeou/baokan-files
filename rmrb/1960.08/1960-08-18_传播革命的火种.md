    Spreading the Sparks of Revolution
    Miu Min

    Although I have not been writing revolutionary memoirs for very long, I have received the Party's kind concern and the enthusiastic encouragement of the vast readership. Since the publication of my "The Fighting Life of Fang Zhimin," I have received many letters from young readers across the country. They are moved by Comrade Fang Zhimin's heroic deeds of dedicating himself to the Party and the revolution, which has become a source of encouragement in their work and study. I feel that the revolutionary struggle memoirs written by veteran comrades are a powerful weapon for carrying out socialist and communist education among the people. It not only helps readers (especially the younger generation) to vividly understand the arduous struggle of the revolutionary predecessors, but also helps them to raise their political and ideological consciousness, carry out ideological transformation, and do their work well. Therefore, we must never regard writing revolutionary memoirs as a personal matter, but as a responsibility that we older comrades should fulfill.

    The Party's trust and the readers' expectations both inspire us to work hard at writing. However, my educational level is not high, and I have had little contact with literature and art in the past, so I have encountered many practical difficulties in writing. In order not to disappoint the Party's expectations and to be responsible to the vast readership, I have not bowed my head to difficulties. Our countless martyrs, our comrades-in-arms and relatives, went through fire and water, shed blood and sacrificed themselves in the long years of revolution. They exchanged blood and heads for today's victorious achievements, and their legacy—the ideal of communism—will be fulfilled by us and the younger generation. We shoulder an extremely great and arduous historical mission, and the glorious task of recalling the history of revolutionary struggle naturally falls on the shoulders of us veteran comrades and veteran comrades-in-arms.

    The writing of revolutionary memoirs is an extremely meaningful and very serious task. A good book often has hundreds of thousands or millions of readers in our country, who are inspired and infected by the work, and even regard it as a textbook for life. Just as some young people read Comrade Fang Zhimin's verses: "The enemy can only cut off our heads, but can never shake our faith! ...It is our sincere wish to shed blood for the Soviets!" They take it as their motto and it becomes a huge force to encourage them to move forward, which is by no means accidental. Therefore, I regard the writing of revolutionary struggle history as a political task assigned to me by the Party, and I am responsible to the reader for every word. My experience is that it is best to have the opportunity to go deep into the masses when writing memoirs. We must find the masses or old comrades-in-arms to collectively recall the situation of the year; the life experiences and character characteristics of some martyrs can also be understood through their relatives and friends and the revolutionary masses who are familiar with them locally. In this way, we can make up for the shortcomings of an individual's incomplete memory or discrepancies with historical facts.

    As far as I know, there are already many veteran comrades who are writing memoirs today, but more veteran comrades need to write. Write about how our Party led the people of the whole country through one arduous revolutionary struggle after another, from victory to victory; write about how our revolutionary path has come about; write about our arduous struggles during the war, so that the next generation knows how we worked hard at that time, relied on our own efforts, and how we worked and fought in a down-to-earth manner under conditions that were much more difficult than today. This will inspire revolutionary fighting spirit and give us complete confidence in overcoming the current difficulties and future difficulties.

    I hope that veteran comrades will participate in the writing of memoirs, even if it is only to record a period of their own life experience or write a touching story. In the past, we used guns to spread this spark, and today, we must use pens to spread the sparks of revolution, so that the sparks of revolution in the hearts of every young person will burn brighter and brighter.

    传播革命的火种
    缪敏
    我从事革命回忆录的写作，时间虽不算长，但得到了党的亲切关怀和广大读者的热情鼓励。我写的《方志敏战斗的一生》出版以来，收到各地青年读者的许多来信。他们为方志敏同志献身于党和革命的英雄事迹所感动，从而成为他们工作和学习中的鼓舞力量。我感到，老同志书写的革命斗争回忆录，是向人民进行社会主义、共产主义教育的有力武器。它不仅帮助读者（特别是青年一代）形象地了解革命前辈艰苦斗争的历程，而且能够帮助他们提高政治思想觉悟、进行思想改造，做好工作。因此，决不要把写革命回忆录看作是个人的事情，而要看成这是我们老一辈的同志应尽的职责。
    党的委托，读者的期望，都激励着我们要努力写作。但是，我的文化水平不高，过去又很少接触文艺，因而在写作上碰到许多实际困难。为了不辜负党的期望，对广大读者负责，我没有向困难低头。我们无数的烈士，我们的战友和亲人，在漫长的革命岁月里，赴汤蹈火，流血牺牲，他们用鲜血和头颅换来了今天的胜利果实，他们的遗志——共产主义的理想，将由我们和青年一代来完成。我们肩负着极其伟大而艰巨的历史使命，而回忆革命斗争历史的光荣任务，就自然地落在我们这些老同志、老战友的肩上。
    革命回忆录的写作，是一件极其有意义的而且是非常严肃的工作。一本好书，在我国常常拥有几十万、成百万的读者，他们从作品中得到启示，受到感染，甚至把它当作生活的教科书。正如有的青年读了方志敏同志的诗句：“敌人只能砍下我们的头颅，决不能动摇我们的信仰！……为着苏维埃流血，那是我们十分情愿的呵！”把它当作座右铭，成为鼓舞他们前进的巨大力量，这决不是偶然的。因此，我把回忆革命斗争历史的写作，看作党交给自己的政治任务，一字一句，都要对读者负责。我的体会是，写回忆录也最好有深入群众的机会。我们要找群众或者老战友集体回忆当年的情况；有些烈士的生活经历和性格特征，也可以通过他们的亲友和当地熟悉他们的革命群众进行了解。这样，便可以弥补一个人回忆不全或和史实有出入的缺陷。
    据我所知，今天拿笔写回忆录的老同志，已经不少了，可是还需要有更多的老同志来写。写我们的党怎样领导着全国人民经历一个又一个艰苦的革命斗争，从胜利走向胜利；写我们的革命路程，是怎样走过来的；写我们在战争时期的艰苦斗争，让后一代知道我们当时是怎样发愤图强，自力更生，是怎样在比今天困难得多的条件下，脚踏实地地工作和战斗的。从而鼓舞起革命斗志，对于当前的困难和今后的困难，完全有信心去克服它。
    我希望老同志们都参加回忆录的写作，哪怕是记录自己的一段生活经验，写下一篇动人的故事也好。我们过去用枪杆传播这星星之火，今天，我们要用笔杆来传播革命的火种，使革命的火种在每一个青年人的心里，越烧越旺。
