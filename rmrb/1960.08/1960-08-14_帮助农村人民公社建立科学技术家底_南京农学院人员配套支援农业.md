Helping Rural People's Communes Establish a Foundation of Science and Technology
Nanjing Agricultural College Personnel Provide Comprehensive Support to Agriculture

(Our report) Nanjing Agricultural College has adopted the method of "organized matching, professional integration" to send more than 800 teachers and students to the Lanhua People's Commune in Jiangpu County and the Yuge People's Commune in Lishui County, providing comprehensive support in science and technology, labor, and new technology and equipment, and helping these two communes establish a complete foundation of agricultural science and technology.

The Agricultural College's "organized matching, professional integration" team includes teachers and students from various majors such as agronomy, fruit trees, vegetables, soil, fertilizer, plant protection, agricultural machinery, agricultural economics, and animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and is equipped with a set of organizations including political workers and administrative personnel. The comprehensive team formed by the cooperation of various majors has played a significant role in conducting comprehensive scientific research and providing comprehensive guidance for agricultural production. The teachers and students of the college stationed in the Yuge Commune, combined with the commune's 10,000-mu high-yield rice field experiment, carried out scientific research activities on a variety of projects. Teachers and students of the Agronomy Department systematically observed rice cultivation and growth, and helped the commune establish a relatively complete "field file" system. Teachers and students of the Soil and Agricultural Chemistry Department cooperated with the Agronomy Department to conduct dense planting experiments of rice under different fertilization levels, providing good conditions for the commune to guide large-field production. According to incomplete statistics, the stationed teachers and students, combined with production, have carried out more than 400 scientific research projects, some of which have achieved significant results.

People's communes with comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries require technical guidance in all aspects. "Professional matching" is conducive to helping communes quickly promote various new technologies and cultivate various types of technical personnel. Teachers and students of the Agricultural Machinery Department, through running training courses, taught farmers the complete set of technologies for the use, manufacture, repair, and maintenance of the "Nannong Shihao B-type rice transplanter," so that the rice transplanter was quickly promoted and applied to large-field production. The Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department ran a training course on "mycelial feed," training more than 300 primary technical personnel for the commune, including more than ten specialized technologies. The Agricultural Economics Department, by participating in the commune's business management work, helped cadres at all levels improve their business management level. Some teachers and students also combined technology transfer with literacy classes, shepherd literacy classes, Red and Expert schools, etc., so that members learned new technologies and improved their cultural level.

Nanjing Agricultural College also provides key support to Yuge and Lanhua People's Communes with agricultural machinery manufacturing equipment, agricultural scientific research instruments, books, etc. Due to the support of "equipment matching," Yuge and Lanhua People's Communes have gradually established a complete system of industrial production, scientific research, and education.

Nanjing Agricultural College's practice of sending teachers and students to support rural areas in complete sets has been developed based on the experience of previous deployments. Since the Great Leap Forward, batches of teachers and students have been sent to rural areas, taking the fields as classrooms and farmers as teachers. In the past two years, more than 3,300 people have been sent to the countryside in batches and phases, supporting rural areas with approximately 400,000 labor days. They have done a lot of work in helping communes reform tools, holding various training courses, and training agricultural technicians, and have been deeply welcomed by the communes. However, in the past, due to the incomplete organization and dispersed majors of the dispatched teachers and students, they still could not adapt to the needs of the development of various undertakings in the people's communes. Therefore, this year, after research by the school party committee, it absorbed previous experiences and better organized the teachers and students dispatched to rural areas, adopting the method of "organized matching, professional integration" to more effectively support agriculture and comprehensively promote grain production.

    帮助农村人民公社建立科学技术家底
    南京农学院人员配套支援农业
    本报讯　南京农学院采取“组织配套，专业成龙”的办法，下放八百多师生到江浦县兰花人民公社和溧水县渔歌人民公社，在科学技术、劳动力和新技术设备方面给予全面的支援，并帮助这两个公社建立了一整套农业科学技术的家底。
    农学院这支“组织配套、专业成龙”的队伍，包括农学、果树、蔬菜、土壤、肥料、植物保护、农业机械、农业经济及畜牧兽医等各个专业的师生，并配备了政治工作人员、事务人员等一套组织。各专业配合组成的综合队伍，对于综合进行科学研究，全面指导农业生产，发挥了显著的作用。这个学院下放在渔歌公社的师生，结合公社万亩水稻丰产方的试验，开展了多种项目的科学研究活动。农学系师生系统观察水稻栽培和生长情况，帮助公社建立了比较完整的“田间档案”制度。土壤农化系师生配合农学系进行水稻在不同施肥水平下的密植试验，为公社指导大田生产提供了良好的条件。据不完全统计，下放师生结合生产，已开展了四百多项科学研究工作，有的已经收到显著成果。
    农林牧副渔全面发展的人民公社，需要各个方面的技术指导。“专业配套”有利于帮助公社迅速推广各项新技术，培养各种各样的技术人材。农机系师生通过开办训练班，向农民传授了“南农事号Ｂ型插秧机”的使用、制造、修理和保管等整套技术，使插秧机很快推广应用于大田生产。畜牧兽医系开办“菌丝饲料”的训练班，为公社培训了三百多名包括十多项专门技术的初级技术人材。农业经济系通过参加公社经营管理工作，帮助各级干部提高经营管理水平。有的师生还结合传授技术开办扫盲班、牧童识字班、红专学校等，使社员们在学得新技术的同时，也提高了文化水平。
    南京农学院还以农机具制造设备、农业科学研究仪器、图书等，重点支援渔歌和兰花人民公社。由于“设备配套”的支援，渔歌和兰花人民公社，已逐步建立起工业生产、科学研究及教育等方面的完整体系。
    南京农学院成套下放师生支援农村的做法，是在吸取了以往几次下放经验的基础上发展起来的。大跃进以来，成批的师生下放到农村，以田间为课堂，拜农民为老师，两年来，有三千三百多人分批分期下乡，支援农村约四十万个劳动日。他们在帮助公社改革工具、举办各种训练班，培养农业技术员等方面做了很多工作，深得公社的欢迎。但过去由于下放的师生组织不全，专业分散，仍不能适应人民公社各项事业发展的需要。因此，今年经校党委研究，吸取了以往的经验，把下放农村的师生更好地组织起来，采取了“组织配套，专业成龙”的办法，更有效地支援农业，全面促进了粮食的生产。
