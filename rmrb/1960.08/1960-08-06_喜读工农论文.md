    Joyfully Reading Workers' and Peasants' Essays	A Paradigm of Integrating Theory with Practice
    To the Editor:
    Recently, the People's Daily has published a number of essays by workers and peasants. Reading these articles has been very enlightening, opening our minds to learning theory and guiding our work. We have truly benefited greatly.
    In the past, we always found it difficult to understand theory. But after reading several workers' and peasants' essays, we feel as though a fog has lifted. These articles can truly be called paradigms of integrating theory with practice.
    For example, in his article "If You Don't Enter the Tiger's Lair, How Can You Catch the Tiger Cubs?" Min Changyuan, a fitter at the Shanghai Film Machinery Factory, discussed how Chairman Mao's "On Practice" taught him that in order to do his work, he must "understand the content and regularity of the work." Therefore, he had to "personally participate in the struggle to change reality" in order to understand "the content and regularity of the work." It was this "If You Don't Enter the Tiger's Lair, How Can You Catch the Tiger Cubs?" thinking that enabled him to boldly begin the trial production of stereoscopic cameras. Furthermore, it was Chairman Mao's theory of grasping the principal contradiction that enabled him to solve the "chain transverse axis" problem.
    As another example, Yue Shangwu, a locomotive driver from the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, said in his article "A National Game of Chess and a Single Chess Piece" that after studying Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction," he used the principle that "the movement of every single thing is interconnected with and mutually influences other things around it" to explain the call for "a national game of chess." He further connected this to his own work, clarifying that in the railway transportation industry, the quick loading and unloading of station services and the fast and frequent runs of locomotives are the hubs of railway machinery, rolling stock, electricity, engineering, and inspection. This hub and other aspects are mutually restrictive and mutually influential. It was this "national game of chess" thinking that inspired their spirit of communist cooperation and encouraged their enthusiasm to complete state tasks in a faster, better, and more economical way.
    These articles make us more clearly aware of the importance of studying Chairman Mao's works: Without revolutionary theory, there is no revolutionary action. As Min Changyuan said: "Mao Zedong Thought is truth, is victory… Arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought will make our work and production invincible." These articles also make us realize that studying theory must be combined with our own work and production, using the theory we have learned to understand the essence and laws of our work, and using the sharp eyes that Chairman Mao has given us to understand objective things and do our work well. For us educators, these articles contain thought-provoking ideas and are worth reading more.
    Finally, we hope that the People's Daily editorial department will publish more of these types of articles, so that those who are just beginning to study theory can draw experience from them, and so that those who claim that "theory is boring" and "theory is useless to me" can open their minds sooner!
            Zhang Quanshui, Bengbu No. 7 Middle School	  Shining with the Light of Mao Zedong Thought
    To the Editor:
    Workers' and peasants' essays contain both the abstract and the concrete, combining the two with a clear aim, and are imbued with the light of Mao Zedong Thought. They are highly ideological and combative, and reading them is very educational. At the same time, workers' and peasants' essays are concise, lively, and logical, making them enjoyable to read over and over again. I believe that workers' and peasants' essays, like new folk songs, embody a new style of writing and learning, which we should advocate and adhere to. I sincerely hope that the newspaper will publish more workers' and peasants' essays, because this will not only help promote the study of theory among workers and peasants, but also help us transform our style of writing and learning.

    Hoping it will Continue Regularly
    To the Editor:
    Recently, I have frequently seen "Selected Workers' and Peasants' Essays" on the seventh page of the People's Daily. I like these articles and read every one of them, even reading some several times. These articles have a common advantage: the language is popular, simple, and easy to understand; the reasoning is thorough, and they are relevant to current work, truly solving problems. Workers and peasants promote advanced ideas in these articles and struggle against conservative ideas. Reading these articles is truly moving. Workers and peasants, who had a very low level of education in the old society, are now masters of culture and have written such good articles. This should be attributed to the leadership of the Communist Party of China. From this, it can be seen that the task of realizing the intellectualization of the working people in China is not a distant one.
    Finally, I hope that "Selected Workers' and Peasants' Essays" will continue to be published regularly.

### 喜读工农论文

1960-08-06

专栏：读者来信

    喜读工农论文	理论结合实际的范例编辑同志：
    最近一个时期，人民日报上刊登了一些工农论文。读了这些文章，我们受到很大启发，觉得既开了我们学习理论的心窍，又指导了我们的工作，真是受益非浅。
    平时，我们在学理论中，总是感到不容易学懂，但最近读了几篇工农论文之后，觉得顿开茅塞。这些文章，真可以说是理论结合实际的范例。
    例如，上海电影机械厂钳工闵长远同志在《不入虎穴，焉得虎子》一文中谈到，毛主席的《实践论》告诉他做工作“要了解工作的内容和规律性”，为此，就要“亲身参加到变革现实的斗争中”，去认识“工作的内容和规律性”。正是这种“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”的思想，使他大胆地开始了立体摄影机的试制工作。又是毛主席的抓主要矛盾的理论，使他解决了“连锁横轴”的难题。
    再如，丰台机务段机车司机长岳尚武同志，在《一盘棋和一只棋》一文中说：他学了毛主席的《矛盾论》后，根据“每一事物的运动都和它的周围其他事物互相联系着和互相影响着”的原理来解释“全国一盘棋”的号召，并且进一步和自己的工作结合了起来，弄清了在铁路交通事业中站务的快装快卸和机务的多拉快跑是铁路上机、车、电、工、检之中的枢纽，这个枢纽和其他方面是互相制约、互相影响的。正是这种一盘棋的思想，激发了他们的共产主义大协作精神，鼓舞了他们的积极性，多快好省地完成国家任务。
    这些文章，使我们更清楚地认识到学习毛主席著作的重要：没有革命的理论，就没有革命的行动。正如闵长远同志说的：“毛泽东思想就是真理，就是胜利……用毛泽东思想来武装自己，就能使我们的工作和生产无往不胜。”这些文章也使我们认识到：学习理论必须与自己的工作、生产结合，用所学的理论去认识自己工作的本质和规律，用毛主席给我们的锐利眼睛去认识客观事物，搞好自己的工作。对我们教育工作者来说，这些文章有发人深省的东西，值得多读。
    最后，希望人民日报编辑部多选登这类文章，让初学理论的同志从中吸取经验；让那些“理论枯燥论者”和“理论对我无用论者”早开心窍！
            蚌埠七中　张全水	  闪烁着毛泽东思想的光辉编辑同志：
    工农论文有虚有实，虚实结合，有的放矢，字里行间闪烁着毛泽东思想的光辉，思想性和战斗性很强，读后使人深受教育。同时，工农论文短小精悍，文字生动活泼，有逻辑性，使人百读不厌。我觉得，工农论文和新民歌一样，体现了新的文风和学风，是我们所应该倡导和坚持的方向。我殷切地希望报上多多刊载工农论文，因为这不仅有助于推动工农学习理论，而且更有助于推动我们改造自己的文风和学风。

        党史系四年一班　刘定祥	    希望经常办下去编辑同志：
    近些时来，在人民日报第七版上经常看到《工农论文选》，我喜欢这些文章，每篇必读，甚至看几遍。这些文章有一个共同的优点，就是语言群众化，简洁通俗，道理说的透，配合当前工作，真能解决问题。工农群众在这些文章里宣传了先进思想，对保守思想进行了斗争。读了这些文章实在令人感动。在过去旧社会文化水平很低的工农群众，如今当了文化的主人，写出了这样好的文章，这应该归功于中国共产党的领导，从这里可以看出在中国实现劳动人民知识化的任务已经不是很遥远的事情了。
    最后，我希望《工农论文选》继续经常地办下去。
