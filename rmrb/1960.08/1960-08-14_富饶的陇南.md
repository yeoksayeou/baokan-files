The Longnan mountainous region is located in the southeastern part of Gansu Province, bordering Sichuan and Shaanxi. The Longnan area includes nine counties and cities: Wudu, Wenxian, Huicheng, Minxian, Xili, Wushan, Qingshui, Qin'an, and Tianshui, covering a total area of over 40,000 square kilometers. It is inhabited by Han, Hui, and Tibetan ethnic groups, with a total population of over three million. The majestic and winding Liupan Mountains, and the North and South Qinling mountain ranges lie within its borders; the Wei River, Jialing River, Bailong River, Baishui River, and Xiniu River flow torrentially. With abundant rainfall, a mild climate, and lush forests, it is known as "Little Jiangnan."

The Longnan mountainous region has extremely favorable conditions for developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. Everywhere is a sea of green mountains and forests, with a total forest area of approximately 38 million mu. Longnan is rich in dried fruits, woody oil materials, and chemical raw materials. Among them, walnuts, tung oil trees, lacquer trees, oil pines, eucommia ulmoides, cork oaks, Mongolian oaks, birches, firs, and other tree species account for the largest proportion. Fruit trees include pears, apples, peaches, apricots, persimmons, ginkgo, citrus, loquat, and others. Tea is also produced in the Liziba area of Wenxian County. According to surveys, there are over a thousand varieties of wild fiber, starch, oil, tannin raw materials, and other products in the area. Longnan is also the main producing area of medicinal materials in Gansu Province, producing over 400 kinds of precious wild and cultivated medicinal materials such as Chinese angelica, codonopsis pilosula, rhubarb, silver ear fungus, golden eardrop, pinellia ternata, fritillaria, and others. There are also precious wild animals such as golden monkeys, pandas, golden leopards, deer, roe deer, bears, and otters.

Since liberation, the transportation industry in the Longnan mountainous region has achieved astonishing development. The Tianlan and Baocheng railways now pass through here, and roads extend in all directions. The most challenging road construction project in the province, the Wen (Wenxian) Yao (Yaodu) highway, has been opened to traffic to Sichuan. The abundant resources and various local specialties of the Longnan mountainous region are now being widely utilized. While developing backbone industries such as iron and steel, coal, coking, petroleum, chemicals, and hydropower, the Longnan mountainous region has built more than 2,590 specialized, county-run, and commune-run factories for processing forest by-products and comprehensively utilizing wild plants. Other fields such as culture, education, health, postal services, and commerce have also achieved rapid development.

    富饶的陇南
    陇南山区在甘肃省的东南部，与四川、陕西接壤。属于陇南地区的有武都，文县、徽成、岷县、西礼、武山、清水、秦安、天水等九个县市，总面积四万多平方公里。这里居住着汉、回、藏三个民族，共三百多万人口。境内六盘山、南北秦岭三大山系巍峨纵横；渭河、嘉陵江、白龙江、白水江、犀牛江等主要河流，汹涌奔流。雨量充沛，气候温和，林木繁茂，资源十分丰富，有“小江南”之称。
    陇南山区发展农、林、牧、副、渔五业的条件非常优越。到处是碧山林海，林地总面积约为三千八百多万亩。陇南盛产干果、木本油料、化工原料。其中以核桃、油桐、漆树、油松、杜仲、栓树、青岗、桦、杉等树种所占比重最大。果树有梨、苹果、桃、杏、柿子、银杏、柑桔、枇杷等。文县李子坝一带并产茶叶。据调查，全区野生纤维、淀粉、油料、栲胶原料等品种达一千余种。陇南又是甘肃省药材主要产地，盛产当归、党参、大黄、银耳、金耳环、茣芋、贝母等四百多种名贵野生和家生药材。并有金丝猴、熊猫、金钱豹、鹿、獐、熊、水獭等珍贵野生动物。
    陇南山区的交通事业，解放后已获得惊人的发展。现在有天兰、宝成两条铁路在这里经过，公路四通八达，全省公路建筑上最艰巨的文（文县）姚（姚渡）公路已通车到四川。现在陇南山区的丰富资源和各种土特产得到了广泛利用。在发展钢铁、煤炭、炼焦、石油、化工、水电等骨干工业的同时，陇南山区已建起各种林副产品加工和综合利用野生植物的专、县、社办工厂二千五百九十多个。其它文教卫生、邮电、商业等也获得了迅速发展。
