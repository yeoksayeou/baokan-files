How to Thin Autumn Vegetables

When sowing autumn vegetables, in order to prevent missing seedlings and broken ridges, the number of seeds sown is several times to dozens of times more than the number of seedlings to be retained in the future. Therefore, after the seedlings emerge, thinning should be carried out to remove diseased and weak seedlings, leaving seedlings with large cotyledons and strong young stems.

Thinning is an important measure for planting autumn vegetables. The timing and frequency of thinning vary depending on the type of vegetable, but in general, thinning should be done early and seedlings should be set at the appropriate time. According to the situation in the Beijing area, autumn vegetables such as Chinese cabbage, radish, mustard greens, and turnips are best thinned three times (the last time being the setting of seedlings). The first thinning should be done early, when the seedlings have grown one true leaf. Because the seedlings are very dense after emergence, delaying thinning will cause the seedlings to crowd each other, hindering growth. Thinning can expand the seedlings' nutrient area. When the seedlings have grown three or four true leaves, the second thinning can be carried out. This time, more seedlings can be retained to avoid missing seedlings due to underground pests. Setting the seedlings should not be too late. The last thinning can be carried out when the Chinese cabbage grows to ten to twelve leaves, the radish is the thickness of a little finger, and the leaves of turnips and mustard greens grow to about five inches high.

Another issue to pay attention to when thinning is to leave seedlings densely. Each thinning should be done with a reasonable density, leaving an appropriate distance between seedlings. Pay attention to reasonable close planting when setting seedlings.

In the morning, the seedlings are more delicate, and thinning can easily injure the remaining seedlings. Thinning at noon will suddenly increase the temperature of the ridge surface because of the reduced shading of some leaves, which is not conducive to the seedlings. After three or four o'clock in the afternoon, the weather slowly cools down, which is a good time for thinning.

    怎样给秋菜间苗
    秋菜播种的时候，为了防止缺苗断垅，所播的种子的数量比将来留苗的棵数要多几倍到几十倍。所以，小苗出土以后，就要进行间苗，把病弱的幼苗去掉，留下子叶肥大、幼茎粗壮的小苗。
    间苗是种秋菜的一项重要措施。间苗的迟早和次数，因蔬菜种类的不同而各异，但一般说来，要早间苗、适时定苗。根据北京地区的情况，大白菜、萝卜、芥菜、蔓菁等秋菜，最好间苗三次（最后一次为定苗）。第一次间苗要早，等到幼苗长出一片真叶的时候就可以进行。因为小苗出土以后，长到很密，间苗晚了，小苗互相拥挤，妨碍生长，间苗可以扩大幼苗的营养面积。等到幼苗长出三、四片真叶的时候，可以进行第二次间苗。这次间苗可以多留一些苗，免得因地下害虫的为害而造成缺苗。定苗不要太晚，大白菜长到十片到十二片、萝卜有小手指粗细、蔓菁和芥菜的叶子长到五寸左右高的时候，就可以进行最后一次间苗。
    间苗还应当注意的一个问题，就是要密留苗。每次间苗都要掌握合理的密度，苗和苗之间留出适当的距离。定苗时要注意合理密植。
    早晨，小苗比较娇嫩，间苗容易碰伤留下的小苗。中午间苗，因为减少一部分叶子的遮荫，畦面温度会骤然增高，对小苗不利。下午三、四点钟以后，天气慢慢凉爽，正是间苗的好时候。
