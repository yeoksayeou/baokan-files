Improve Breeding Techniques to Mass Produce Chlorella
　　Salty Water Can Also Breed Chlorella
　　Workers at the Shizuishan City Farm in Ningxia have boldly experimented and successfully cultivated chlorella using salty water during the promotion of chlorella production. This is of great value for large-scale chlorella cultivation in the southern mountainous areas where salty water is abundant.
　　The water quality around the Shizuishan City Farm is bitter and salty. To obtain fresh water, it is necessary to fetch it from the Yellow River, which is three miles away. According to foreign experience, chlorella can only grow in fresh water. Could salty water be used to cultivate chlorella on a large scale? This problem remained unsolved for a considerable period. As a result, the farm's chlorella production was limited to cultivation in tanks and basins, preventing large-scale production. In late June, during the mass movement to vigorously promote chlorella production in rural areas, the Shizuishan City Party Committee called on all units to boldly experiment and find experiences in producing chlorella based on local conditions. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the workers of the Shizuishan City Farm broke down superstitions and used salty water to cultivate chlorella. After fifteen experiments, they finally succeeded and put it into large-scale production. Their specific methods are as follows:
　　(1) Increase fertilizer. In order to neutralize the alkalinity, they used fermented chicken manure to prepare the culture solution, using the acidity of the chicken manure culture solution to neutralize the alkalinity, making the culture solution close to neutral, which is suitable for chlorella growth.
　　(2) Increase the "seeding amount." In order to compensate for the damage to chlorella cells caused by the slightly alkaline culture solution after neutralization, the amount of chlorella seed solution was increased from the original 10% to 30% based on increasing the amount of culture solution. In this way, although chlorella is cultivated with salty water, its growth is normal and it matures in three to four days in summer, with a very high concentration.
　　(3) Increase the number of mixing times to ensure full air circulation and strengthen the respiration and photosynthesis of chlorella.
　　(4) Deepen the culture layer. According to the high temperature and strong sunshine in summer, especially in open-air culture ponds, the water temperature changes greatly day and night. Shallow water culture will affect the reproduction of algae, so the water must be gradually increased to a depth of one to one and a half feet.

　　Prevent and Control Pests that Harm Chlorella
　　In the utilization of natural ponds for the cultivation of chlorella, the harm of protozoa and rotifers may be found. These pests are a great threat to chlorella, especially the rotifers which devour chlorella are even more serious.
　　Prevention and control methods are being tested everywhere. The following methods can be tried at present: 1. Filter the algae liquid with white cloth to remove the protozoa and rotifers, which are larger in size. 2. Add copper sulfate with a concentration of 8 parts per million to the algae liquid to kill rotifers in half an hour. Although this will cause a small amount of chlorella to precipitate, the impact is not significant. 3. Add wettable "666" with a concentration of 5 parts per 100,000 to the algae liquid to kill rotifers. Regardless of which method is used, stop using it if you find that one-half of the chlorella has precipitated during medication.
　　The struggle against pests that harm chlorella should also implement the policy of prevention being more important than treatment. Disinfect with a "666" powder solution with a concentration of 5 parts per 100,000 or a bleaching powder with a concentration of 5 parts per million before inoculation to prevent dust and other debris from entering, which can play a preventive role.

　　Appropriate Stirring Can Promote Accelerated Chlorella Reproduction
　　Next to the chlorella culture pond, people who cultivate chlorella are seen using tools to stir the culture solution in the pond every day. Why is it necessary to stir every day? There are many scientific reasons for this.
　　First, it can strengthen the respiration of chlorella. Because chlorella, like other organisms, needs to breathe during its growth process. Appropriate agitation of the culture solution can dissolve air in the culture solution, thus increasing the oxygen content of the culture solution, strengthening the respiration of chlorella, promoting photosynthesis and metabolism, and making chlorella reproduce more quickly. At the same time, it can also prevent the surface of the culture solution from producing a thin film formed by the condensation of substances secreted by bacteria. This bacterial film often reduces the air in the culture solution, and light cannot be well radiated in; and it takes away the nutrients in the culture solution, agglutinates the chlorella, and makes the chlorella sink. This is very harmful to the growth and reproduction of chlorella.
　　Secondly, by stirring the culture solution, the sinking of chlorella can be prevented. Whenever the light is weak, the temperature is low, and the pH of the culture solution changes, it often causes chlorella to sink rapidly or attach to the side walls of the culture pond or culture tank. After the chlorella sinks, it often gathers together, forming clumps of varying sizes, causing the chlorella to age rapidly; at the same time, an antibiotic (chlorellin) is produced, which causes the chlorella to lose its ability to grow and divide, and the cultivation work will fail.
　　From these points of view, the stirring work of the culture solution is very important. However, the number of stirring times should not be too many, it is best to stir twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon. The length of each stirring time depends on the size of the culture pond. When stirring, it should not be completely in one direction, otherwise, it will cause centrifugal action, causing the chlorella to sink, which will have an adverse effect.

　　The Advantages of Using Paddy Fields to Dig Ponds to Cultivate Chlorella: Saving Materials, Saving Labor, and Maturing Earlier
　　The Liuxia People's Commune Livestock Farm in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, has successfully cultivated chlorella by using paddy fields to dig ponds. At present, more than 4,500 catties of chlorella have been cultivated from paddy field algae ponds, opening up new avenues for large-scale reproduction of chlorella in the future.
　　To produce chlorella, there must be a culture pond. However, the lack of materials for building the pond and the tight labor force have stymied the large-scale cultivation of chlorella. In order to overcome this difficulty, Party Branch Secretary Gao Xiaomao mobilized the masses to offer suggestions. After discussion, everyone agreed to conduct experiments first. Then, led by Branch Secretary Gao Xiaomao, they selected a piece of clay paddy field with a low groundwater level near the feed adjustment room and made a 16-square-meter culture pond. After five days of hard work, the chlorella cultivation experiment was successful.
　　They summarized the experience of using paddy fields to dig ponds to cultivate chlorella, believing that there are three major advantages: first, saving materials, algae ponds with an area of two-tenths of a mu of paddy field can save 200 yuan in pond construction costs; second, saving labor, the same area of two-tenths of a mu requires ninety workers to build two ponds, while using paddy fields to dig ponds only requires ten workers, and it is convenient to draw water, saving labor for carrying water; third, growth and reproduction are fast, because paddy fields contain phosphorus, potassium and other fertilizers, which promote growth and reproduction, and mature two or three days earlier than ordinary ponds, with a short reproduction time and high yield.
　　After the success of the experiment of using paddy fields to dig ponds to cultivate chlorella, the Commune Party Committee immediately held an on-site meeting here to promote this experience. Now, 42 paddy field culture ponds have been built in the whole commune. (Attached picture)

    改进繁殖技术　大量生产小球藻	咸水也能繁殖小球藻
    宁夏石咀山市农牧场职工在推广小球藻生产当中，大胆试验，使用咸水培养小球藻成功。这对咸水较多的南部山区大面积培养小球藻，具有重大的价值。
    石咀山市农牧场周围水质苦咸，要用淡水需要到离场三里远的黄河里去取。根据外地经验，小球藻只能在淡水中生长，能否大量利用咸水培养小球藻？在比较长的一段时间里没有解决这个问题。结果全场小球藻生产只限于缸、盆的培养，不能大面积生产。6月下旬，在农村大力推广小球藻生产的群众运动中，中共石咀山工委号召各单位要大胆试验，因地制宜地找出生产小球藻的经验。石咀山市农牧场职工在党支部的领导下，破除迷信，用咸水培养小球藻，经过十五次试验，终于成功，并投入大面积生产。他们采取的具体办法是：
      （一）增加肥料。为了中和碱性，他们利用鸡粪发酵配制培养液，利用鸡粪培养液的酸性中和碱性，使培养液接近中性，适宜小球藻生长。
      （二）增加“播种量”。为弥补经过中和的微碱培养液对小球藻细胞的损伤，在增加培养液用量的基础上，把小球藻种子液，从原来的10％增到30％，这样，小球藻虽然用咸水培养，但生长正常，在夏季三、四天内即可成熟，而且浓度很高。
      （三）增加搅拌次数，使空气充分流通，加强小球藻的呼吸作用和光合作用。
      （四）加深培养层。根据夏季气温高、日照强的情况，特别是露天培养池，日夜水温变化很大，浅水培养会影响藻体的繁殖，必须把水逐步增加到一至一尺五深。
  	    石咀山市农牧场　应懋芬防治为害小球藻的害虫
    在利用天然池塘培养小球藻中，可能发现原生动物和轮虫的为害。这些虫害对小球藻威胁很大，特别是轮虫吞食小球藻更为严重。
    防治方法各地都在试验，目前可以试用的有以下几种：1、藻液用白布过滤，原生动物、轮虫体积较大，可以滤除。2、用浓度百万分之八的硫酸铜加入藻液中，半小时后可杀死轮虫。这样虽会使少量小球藻沉淀，但影响不大。3、用十万分之五的可湿性“六六六”加入藻液中，也可杀死轮虫。不论用哪种办法，在用药时如发现有二分之一小球藻有沉淀现象，就停止采用。
    对为害小球藻的害虫作斗争，也应该贯彻执行防重于治的方针。接种以前先用十万分之五的“六六六”粉溶液或百万分之五的漂白粉消毒，不叫尘土等杂物侵入，都可以起到预防的作用。北京农业大学农学系植物教研组畜牧系饲料研究室适当搅拌能促使		    小球藻加速繁殖
    在小球藻培养池旁，每天都见到培养小球藻的人用工具将池内的培养液进行搅拌。为什么每天都要搅拌呢？这里有很多科学道理。
    首先，可以加强小球藻的呼吸作用。因为小球藻和其它生物一样，在生长过程中需要呼吸。适当搅动培养液可使空气溶解在培养液内，因而增加培养液的氧气含量，加强小球藻的呼吸，促进光合作用和新陈代谢，使小球藻繁殖更为迅速。同时，又可以防止培养液的表面产生一层由细菌分泌的物质凝结成的薄膜。这种菌膜常常使培养液中的空气减少，光线不能很好射入；并且夺去培养液内的养分，将小球藻凝集，使小球藻下沉。这对于小球藻的生长繁殖都很有害。
    其次，通过搅拌培养液，可防止小球藻的下沉，每当光线弱、温度低、培养液的酸碱度发生变化时，往往使小球藻急速下沉，或附在培养池、培养缸的侧壁。小球藻下沉后又常互相集结在一起，形成一个一个大小不等的团块，使小球藻急速地衰老；同时还会发生一种抗菌素（小球藻素）使小球藻失去生长和分裂的能力，培养工作就归于失败。
    从这些看来，培养液的搅拌工作很重要。但是，搅拌的次数也不能太多，一天最好搅拌两次：上下午各一次。每次搅拌的时间长短，要看培养池的大小而定。搅拌时不能完全顺着一个方向，否则会发生离心作用，使得小球藻下沉，起到不良的作用。
        华南师范学院生物系小球藻研究组		利用水田挖池培养小球藻好处是：节约材料　节省劳力　提前成熟
    浙江杭州市留下人民公社畜牧场利用水田挖池培养小球藻成功。目前，已由水田藻池培育小球藻四千五百余斤，为今后大面积繁殖小球藻开辟了新的道路。
    要生产小球藻，一定要有培养池。但要建池缺乏材料，劳力也紧张，这些困难卡住了小球藻的大量培养。为了克服这个困难，党支部书记高小毛就发动群众，献计献策。经过讨论，大家同意先搞试验。接着由支部书记高小毛带队，在饲料调剂室附近，选择了一块地下水位较低的粘土水田，做成了十六平方米的培养池，经过五天的努力，小球藻培养试验获得成功。
    他们总结了利用水田挖池培养小球藻的经验，认为有三大好处：第一，节约材料，二分水田面积的藻池就能节省建池成本费二百元；第二，节约劳动力，同样建造二分田面积的二个池，需九十个工，利用水田挖池只需要十个工，而且引水方便，节约挑水劳力；第三，生长繁殖快，由于水田含有磷、钾等肥分，促使生长繁殖，比一般水池提前二、三天成熟，繁殖时间短，产量高。
    利用水田挖池培养小球藻的试验获得成功以后，公社党委立即在这里召开了现场会议，推广这一经验。现在全社已建起水田培养池四十二个。（附图片）
