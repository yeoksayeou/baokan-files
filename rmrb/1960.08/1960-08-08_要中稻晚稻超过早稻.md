To Make Mid-season and Late-season Rice Surpass Early Rice

The broad masses of people in various provinces and regions of southern China, after a great effort throughout the spring and summer, overcoming various unfavorable natural factors, have achieved a victory in the early rice harvest. Now is the peak growing season for mid-season rice, single-crop late rice, and northern rice. We should advance on this victory and strive with all our might to make the harvest of these types of rice surpass that of early rice. This is of great significance for winning a bumper grain harvest for the whole year.

Rice is China's most important high-yield grain crop. According to the situation in 1959, the rice planting area accounted for 27.2% of the grain crop planting area, but the rice produced accounted for 39.8% of the total grain output. Mid-season rice, single-crop late rice, and northern rice are the major components of rice. Taking 1959 as an example again, the planting area of these three types of rice accounted for 48% of the total rice planting area, but the total output accounted for 54% of the total rice output. The total area of mid-season rice, single-crop late rice, and northern rice is larger than that of early rice, and the growing period is longer than that of early rice. The yield per unit area and total output have historically been higher than those of early rice. We should put more effort into managing these types of rice than we did in managing early rice.

After the transplanting of mid-season rice, single-crop late rice, and northern rice this year, the climate in many areas has been abnormal. Some are growing very well, some are not growing so well, and some areas still have a relatively large number of third-class seedlings. This situation shows that the potential for increased production in these types of rice is very large. As long as our work catches up, we fully exploit the conditions conducive to the growth of seedlings, and we control or even eliminate the unfavorable factors for seedling growth to the maximum extent, striving to turn originally low-yielding fields into high-yielding fields, and to make originally high-yielding fields even higher-yielding, it is entirely possible to achieve a general increase in production and a bumper harvest.

In the current field management of rice, what measures should we focus on?

The first is sufficient water. Currently, it is the season with the highest temperature and the largest evaporation. Southern rice paddies consume about five to eight millimeters of water per day. Many areas lack rainfall, and we should be alert to the regular occurrence of drought in August. Drought is the greatest threat to rice. Rice is particularly afraid of drought during the booting and flowering period. If there is a lack of water in the early stage of booting, the formation of florets will be affected, and the number of grains per ear will be reduced. If there is a lack of water in the middle stage of booting, the development of florets will be incomplete, and they will not be able to flower and bear fruit normally. If there is a lack of water in the late stage of booting, the pollen mother cells will not be able to develop normally, and there will be flowering without fertilization. Last year, in July and August, serious drought occurred in the southern rice-growing areas. According to a survey by the Chengyan Commune in Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, rice fields that were dehydrated during the booting period had a heading delay of fourteen days, a sterility rate of 45%, and a yield per unit area that was 27% less than that of fields that were not dehydrated. After rice heading, until the waxy ripening stage, although the requirement for water is not as urgent as during the booting and flowering stage, it is still essential not to lack water, because about two-thirds of the grain weight is formed after heading. With sufficient water, photosynthesis is strengthened, and the filling and ripening are full, and the yield will inevitably increase. Research by the irrigation experiment stations in Mianzhu, Dayi, and Shifang in Sichuan Province shows that irrigation at the beginning of heading increases production by 4%-11.7% compared to no irrigation, and irrigation at the beginning of milky ripening increases production by 4.6%-8.5% compared to no irrigation. From this, it can be seen how important timely water supply is for rice yield. All areas where drought occurs should be urgently mobilized to seriously summarize and promote the rich experience of the broad masses in fighting drought for a long time, step up the overhaul and replenishment of water lifting tools, firmly establish the determination to fight drought when there is drought and prevent drought when there is no drought, and do a good job in drought prevention and resistance. There are many methods for storing and conserving water. Digging wells and ponds can make extensive use of groundwater. Building dams across rivers can store surface water. Identifying tides can bring in water with the tide. More importantly, we should seize the opportunity to store rainwater. There are even more successful experiences in rational water use, such as using living water first, preserving pond water and reservoir water as much as possible; in the order of irrigation, irrigating high fields before low fields, dry fields before wet fields, high water for high irrigation and low water for low irrigation, implementing zonal and timed rotation irrigation, and planned water use and controlled water use, etc. These effective methods can be widely adopted according to local conditions.

The second is pest control. Due to the high temperature last winter, the mortality rate of overwintering pests was low, and many areas have experienced pests and diseases that harm mid-season rice and single-crop late rice. In particular, rice stem borers and rice planthoppers reproduce quickly and cause the greatest harm. We must fully grasp the pest situation, make all preparations for pesticides and equipment, and prevent and control them as early as possible, which can achieve twice the result with half the effort. In areas where early rice and mid-season/single-crop late rice are mixed, pests will inevitably concentrate in the mid-season and single-crop late rice fields after the early rice is harvested, which is the best time to wipe out pests. Arranging a certain amount of labor to encircle and suppress pests in mid-season and single-crop late rice fields can not only ensure a bumper harvest of mid-season and single-crop late rice, but also greatly reduce the pest damage to double-crop late rice. Pest control should combine professional team control with large-scale blitz annihilation to achieve rapid and thorough control.

The third is topdressing. Agricultural labor model Chen Yongkang studied the "three yellow, three black" growth law of single-crop late rice and believes that topdressing is best applied three times. The first topdressing should be early to promote early development in the early stage; the second topdressing should be before jointing, requiring complete fertilizer and stable and long-lasting efficacy to facilitate the thickening of stems and full storage of nutrients in the leaf sheaths; the third topdressing should be panicle fertilizer, requiring the application of fast-acting chemical fertilizers or decomposed human and animal manure. Now is the time for the second and third topdressings. We should do everything possible to supplement fertilizer. This is a key measure to promote large panicles and many grains and is an effective way to use fertilizer economically. We must seize the opportunity and earnestly grasp it.

The key to comprehensively and thoroughly doing a good job in field management of these types of rice is the rational use of labor. Without sufficient labor, even the best production increase measures will be powerless. Taizhou County, Jiangsu Province, after increasing field labor, adopted a method combining professional management and blitz attacks. First, it organized superior labor to carry out a blitz campaign for mid-season rice field management. After the main tasks were completed, the routine tasks were assigned to professional teams for management. Secretaries at all levels went deep into the front line of production, divided areas and took responsibility, leading production, "going to places with many third-class seedlings, going to places with little fertilizer, going to places with many weeds, and going to backward places." This method is extremely effective and should be greatly promoted. Diligent people and fertile land, putting in one more effort can yield one more harvest. During the critical period of crop growth, we should pay even closer attention to field management and strive for even greater increases in production.

    要中稻晚稻超过早稻
    我国南方各个省区的广大人民，今年大干一春一夏，战胜各种不利的自然因素，取得了早稻丰收的胜利。现在是中稻、一季晚稻和北方水稻的生长旺期，应该乘胜前进，全力争取这几种水稻的收成超过早稻，这对于夺取全年粮食丰收，具有极大的意义。
    水稻是我国最重要的高产粮食作物。按照1959年的情况来说，水稻播种面积占粮食作物播种面积的27.2％，生产的稻谷却占粮食总产量的39.8％。中稻、一季晚稻和北方稻又是水稻中的大头。还以1959年为例，这三种水稻的种植面积占水稻种植总面积的48％，总产量却占稻谷总产量的54％。中稻、一季晚稻和北方稻的总面积比早稻大，生长期比早稻长，历年来单位面积产量和总产量都比早稻高，我们应该拿出比管理早稻更大的劲头来管理这几种水稻。
    今年中稻、一季晚稻和北方水稻栽插以后，不少地区气候不正常，有的长得很好，有的长得不太好，有的地区还有较多的三类苗。这种情况说明了，在这几种水稻中，增产潜力是很大的。只要我们的工作赶上去，充分发挥有利于禾苗生长的条件，最大限度地控制以至消除禾苗生长的不利因素，争取原来低产的变成高产，原来高产的更加高产，完全可能作到普遍增产丰收。
    在当前水稻田间管理上，应该抓紧哪些措施呢？
    第一条是足水。目前是气温最高、蒸发量最大的季节。南方稻田每天消耗水量约五至八毫米。不少地区雨水不足，应该警惕带有规律性的8月份伏旱的发生。干旱对于水稻是最大的威胁。水稻在孕穗扬花期间，特别怕干旱。水稻孕穗初期如果缺水，颖花形成受了影响，每穗粒数要减少。孕穗中期如果缺水，颖花发育不健全，不能正常开花结实。孕穗后期缺水，花粉母细胞不能正常发育，将会花而不孕。去年7、8月间，南方稻区发生严重干旱，据江苏省高邮县城堰公社调查，孕穗期间脱水的稻田，出穗延迟了十四天，不实率占45％，单位面积产量比没有脱水的少27％。水稻抽穗以后，到腊熟以前，对于水分的要求虽然没有孕穗扬花阶段那么迫切，可是仍然不能缺水，因为籽实重量的三分之二左右，是在抽穗以后形成的。水分充足，光合作用加强，灌浆、结实饱满，产量必然增加。四川省绵竹、大邑、什邡灌溉试验站研究，抽穗始期灌水，比不灌水的增产4％—11.7％，乳熟开始时灌水，比不灌水的增产4.6％—8.5％。由此可见，及时供水对于水稻产量是多么重要。凡是发生旱象的地区，应该紧急动员起来，认真总结、推广广大群众长期对干旱作斗争的丰富经验，加紧检修和添置提水工具，坚定有旱抗旱、无旱防旱的决心，做好防旱抗旱工作。蓄水、保水的方法是很多的。打井挖塘，可以广泛利用地下水。拦河筑坝，可以蓄存地上水。鉴定潮汛，可以迎潮引水。而更主要的，是抓紧时机，贮蓄雨水。在合理用水方面，成功的经验更多，例如先用活水，尽可能保存塘水和库水；在灌水顺序上，先高田后低田，先干田后湿田，高水高灌低水低灌，实行分片定时轮灌，计划用水控制用水等等。这些行之有效的方法，可以因地制宜，广泛采用。
    第二条是治虫。由于去冬气温高，越冬害虫死亡率低，不少地区发生了为害中稻和一季晚稻的病虫害。特别是三化螟和稻飞虱，繁殖很快，危害最大。我们要充分掌握虫情，做好一切药械准备，及早防治，可以事半功倍。在早稻和中稻、一季晚稻混种地区，早稻收割以后，害虫必然集中到中稻和一季晚稻田里，这是歼灭虫害的最好时机。安排一定劳力，围剿中稻田和一季晚稻田的害虫，不仅可以保证中稻、一季晚稻丰收，而且可以大大减轻双季晚稻的虫害。防治病虫要实行专业队除治和大规模突击歼灭相结合，以收迅速、彻底防治之效。
    第三条是追肥。农业劳模陈永康研究一季晚稻“三黄三黑”的生长规律，认为追肥最好施三次。第一次追肥宜早，促进前期早发；第二次在拔节以前，要求肥分齐全，效力稳长，以利茎秆长粗，并利用叶鞘充分贮积养分；第三次施穗肥，要求施用效力快的化肥或腐熟人畜粪尿。目前正是第二、三两次追肥时候。应该千方百计，补施肥料。这是促进穗大、粒多的关键性措施，是经济用肥的有效方式，必须掌握时机，认真抓紧。
    全面、彻底做好这几种水稻的田间管理工作的关键是合理使用劳力。如果没有足够的劳动力，再好的增产措施也无能为力。江苏省泰州县在增加田间劳力以后，采取专业管理与突击相结合的方式，首先组织优势劳力，开展中稻田间管理突击旬。把主要的事情作完了，把经常的事情拨归专业队管理。各级书记深入生产第一线，划片包干，领导生产，“到三类苗多的地方去，到肥料少的地方去，到杂草多的地方去，到落后的地方去”。这种方法极为有效，应该大加推广。人勤地壮，多下一分工夫，就可以多得一分收获，在庄稼生长的关键时期，更应该抓紧田间管理，力争更大增产。
