Drivers Yang Quanzhen, Yang Weixin, Jia Hualu, and Xu Guang from the No. 1 Motorcade of the Guizhou Provincial Transportation Company, were named "Ten Thousand Li Heroes" by the company for achieving safety, economy, and a vehicle-ton-month production of ten thousand ton-kilometers every month from January to June this year while transporting key materials.

Of these four "Ten Thousand Li Heroes," Jia Hualu is a veteran driver with twenty-two years of experience, while the other three learned to drive after liberation. In January this year, they were assigned to work together, driving two Liberation brand trucks in double shifts. To achieve more loading and faster speed, they always tried every possible means to save time. Neither thick fog, heavy rain, nor snow and ice could stop them from driving. When the fog was heavy, they would get out of the car to check the road, checking and driving at the same time. When the road was flooded, they would first test the depth of the water on foot and then drive the car, ensuring safety and saving time. They always took care of each other, and before handing over the shift, they would make all preparations for the person taking over. There have been no driving accidents in the past six months. The two trucks they drove also saved approximately 1,000 and 500 liters of gasoline respectively.

    万里英雄
    贵州省运输公司汽车一场驾驶员杨泉臻、杨维新、贾华禄、许光等四人，在今年元月到6月运送重点物资的战斗中，月月都实现了安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里，被公司命名为“万里英雄”。
    这四位“万里英雄”中，除贾华禄是有二十二年工龄的老驾驶员外，其余三位都是在解放以后才学习驾驶汽车的。今年元月，他们被调在一起，双班驾驶两辆解放牌汽车。为了实现多装快跑，他们总是千方百计地争取时间。不论是浓雾、暴雨或冰雪天，都不能拦阻他们行车。雾大，他们就下车查看路途，边查看边行车，雨水淹路，他们就先步行试涉，然后开车，既保证了安全，又赢得了时间。他们互相之间总是互相体贴，在交班之前，都要为接班的人做好一切准备，半年以来从未发生过行车事故。他们开的两部车还分别节省汽油约一千和五百公升。
