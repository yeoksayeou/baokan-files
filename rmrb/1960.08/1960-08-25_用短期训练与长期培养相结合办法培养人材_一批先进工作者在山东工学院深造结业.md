Using a Combination of Short-Term Training and Long-Term Development to Cultivate Talent
A Group of Advanced Workers in Shandong Institute of Technology Successfully Completes Further Studies

(Our newspaper reporter Liu Guanquan reports) Thirty-seven advanced producers from Shandong's industrial front have successfully completed their studies at the Shandong Institute of Technology's Advanced Producer Study and Research Class after three months of diligent learning, passing their graduation defense on the 13th of this month.

These thirty-seven advanced producers are all key personnel on Shandong's industrial front and vanguards in the technical revolution movement, all having achieved outstanding results in production. Among them are factory directors, engineers, workshop directors, work section chiefs, technicians, and technical staff promoted from the ranks of workers.

This Study and Research Class was established in accordance with the Shandong Provincial Party Committee's instructions to vigorously improve the political, technical, and cultural levels of advanced producers. Shandong Institute of Technology proposed the plan, and with the strong support of relevant units, the various teaching and research departments of the institute took the initiative to connect with each advanced producer, improving their urgently needed basic technical and theoretical knowledge. At the same time, these advanced producers provided the teachers with the rich experience they had accumulated in practice. In this way, the teachers not only enriched the teaching content but also summarized experience.

After three months of study, these advanced producers have now mastered basic mathematical operations for general engineering, such as algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. They have also mastered basic concepts and design and calculation knowledge in courses such as mechanical drawing, theoretical mechanics, materials mechanics, machine parts, and principles of machinery. Taking the mechanics class as an example, they have basically mastered the three basic aspects of design work: calculation, structural selection, and drawing. Therefore, they have solved many of the "roadblocks" encountered during the great technical revolution.

The advanced producers studied and worked at Shandong Institute of Technology simultaneously. Based on their individual expertise, they cooperated with the teachers and students of the institute to vigorously engage in scientific research and technical revolution, and have completed a number of research projects suitable for communes, such as multi-purpose machine tools and phototubes. Advanced producer Qu Shuzi said: "We must use what we learn, and learn when we use it. We do not forget innovation while learning, and we learn again when we encounter difficulties during innovation."

In order to combine short-term concentrated learning with long-term development, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, Shandong Institute of Technology has formulated a plan to continue to train and improve advanced producers in the next few years, and has already begun to implement it. All relevant teaching and research departments of the institute are linked to each advanced producer for the long term. Taking production as the key, starting from the actual problems they encounter in production and technical innovation, and targeting different objects, they will compile textbooks and special textbooks around professional courses and supplement necessary technical basic courses. Through a combination of short-term concentrated learning and long-term development, correspondence courses, face-to-face instruction, and individual regular tutoring, they will enable them to reach the level of junior college in technical theory within two or three years, becoming advanced construction talents who are both red and expert, with both rich production experience and high theoretical knowledge.

    用短期训练与长期培养相结合办法培养人材
    一批先进工作者在山东工学院深造结业
    本报讯　记者刘关权报道：山东工业战线上的三十七名先进生产者，在山东工学院先进生产者学习研究班通过三个月的努力学习，已在本月13日通过结业答辩胜利结业。
    这三十七位先进生产者都是山东工业战线上的骨干，技术革命运动中的尖兵，他们都在生产中创造了出色的成绩。他们当中有由工人提拔的厂长、工程师、车间主任、工段长、技师、技术员等。
    这个学习研究班是根据中共山东省委关于大力提高先进生产者政治、技术、文化水平的指示，由山东工学院提出方案，在各有关单位大力支持下开办的。通过短期训练与长期培养相结合的办法，山东工学院各教研室主动和每个先进生产者挂钩，提高他们的急需的技术理论基础知识，同时，这些先进生产者把他们在实践中积累的丰富经验提供给教师，这样，教师们既丰富了教学内容，又总结了经验。
    这些先进生产者经过三个月的学习，现已掌握了代数、几何、三角等一般工程的基本数学运算，掌握了机械制图和理论力学、材料力学、机械零件、机械原理等课程的基本概念及设计、运算知识。以机械班为例，设计工作的三个基本方面，即计算、结构选择和绘图，他们都能基本掌握了。因此，解决了很多过去大闹技术革命时的“拦路虎”。
    先进生产者们在山东工学院边学边干，他们根据个人的专长，和工学院师生合作大搞科学研究和技术革命，已完成了适合公社用的多用机床、光电管等不少研究项目。先进生产者曲淑姿说：“我们学了就要用，用时又学，学习不忘革新，革新时碰到困难再学”。
    为了做到短期集中学习和长期培养相结合，山东工学院在省委的领导下，已拟出今后几年内继续培养提高先进生产者的计划，并已开始执行。全学院有关教研室分别和每个先进生产者长期挂钩，以生产为纲，从他们在生产、技术革新中遇到的实际问题入手，针对不同对象，编写围绕专业课、补充必要技术基础课的教材和专题教材，通过短期集中学习与长期培养相结合，函授、面授和个别定期辅导等方式，使他们在两、三年内在技术理论方面达到大专水平，成为既有丰富生产经验又有高度理论知识的又红又专的高级建设人材。
