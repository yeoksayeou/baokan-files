After the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament unanimously adopted the Tokyo Declaration, the General Resolution, and the Suggestions for International Joint Action at its plenary session on the 9th, it has successfully concluded. This conference, attended by representatives from twenty-eight countries and ten international organizations from all continents, along with ten thousand representatives from cities and villages across Japan, was truly a militant world conference and a grand review of anti-American peace forces on a broad foundation.

At this conference, peace forces from Japan and around the world engaged in enthusiastic discussions, exchanged experiences in the peace movement, and clearly recognized that the war and aggression policies of U.S. imperialism threaten world peace and are obstacles to peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Sri Lankan representative Theja Gunawardhana said, "The network of military bases that the United States is trying to use to shackle the world is the main source of the danger of nuclear war. The United States is also trampling on the sovereignty of countries where American bases are located." She exposed how American merchants of death are trying to disguise themselves as friends of peace and called on participants to engage in vigorous struggles against the war forces that masquerade as protectors of peace and freedom. Indian representative Mansoor Gilani said: As long as there is imperialism, there will be no stable world peace. Chilean representative Jose Venturelli said that the war threat in Latin America is created by U.S. imperialism. Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, emphasized that for the Japanese people, true peace can only be guaranteed by abolishing all U.S. bases in Japan and the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Sudanese representative Ahmed Mohamed Kheir pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Asia, Africa, and the world, and he called on the peace-loving people of all continents to unite against their common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

At this conference, representatives from various countries also unified their understanding of the view that the achievement of world peace must rely on the people's struggle. As the "Tokyo Declaration" adopted by the conference correctly reflects: "In order to realize peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and to protest against aggression and war, the people of all countries in the world are increasingly strongly demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs, general disarmament, the abolition of military alliance treaties, and the cancellation of foreign military bases. These demands of the people of all countries in the world should and must be realized through resolute struggles against the imperialist and colonialist forces headed by the United States, who refuse all these demands." The conference emphasized that the movement for national independence is an important part of the cause of world peace. An Indonesian representative said that the peace movement and the national independence movement are inseparable, and the Japanese people's struggle against the new "Security Treaty" is the most powerful example. The "Tokyo Declaration" states, "We are now living in an unprecedented era in human history in which oppressed nations and peoples are fighting for liberation. For this great cause, the movement for peace and the independence of the people of all countries is developing firmly and united."

At this conference, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's peace initiative on establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia and the Pacific region received a strong response. Participating representatives, especially those from Asian countries, expressed their full support. The Indonesian representative believed that Premier Zhou's peace initiative was fully in line with the Bandung Principles. All the people of Asia and the Pacific region will support this initiative because it is beneficial to the people of all countries. The Sri Lankan representative believed that Premier Zhou's peace initiative reflected the common demands of the Asian people. It is a touchstone of true and false peace, and all those who truly desire peace should accept this proposal.

The general resolution adopted by the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs fully reflects the determination of representatives from participating countries to safeguard world peace and to wage a tit-for-tat struggle against the war and aggression policies of imperialism headed by the United States. The general resolution strongly condemns the war conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, calls on the people of Asian countries and the world's peace forces to unite closely with the Japanese people, and launches a united struggle for the prohibition of nuclear weapons, the abolition of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and the prevention of the revival of Japanese militarism, strengthening the peace movement. The general resolution calls on the people of all countries in the world to resist the aggressive military treaty organizations of the United States and oppose the U.S. preparations for war in South Vietnam and West Irian; demands the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Asia-Pacific region and Central Europe; demands the conclusion of non-aggression treaties between Asian and Pacific countries; demands that U.S. imperialism withdraw from Okinawa and Taiwan; and demands the reunification of Korea and Vietnam.

From the high morale and enthusiastic spirit displayed by the participating representatives during the discussion process, and from the series of resolutions adopted by the conference, we can see that the people of Japan and all countries in the world are full of confidence and determination to defend world peace. The various resolutions passed by the conference will undoubtedly mobilize and encourage more people to rise up and wage a more resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism and to defend peace. This conference is a great victory for the world's peace-loving forces. It shows that the awareness of the people of the world is increasing day by day; proving that imperialism and all reactionaries, including modern revisionism, no matter what means they use, cannot stop the progress of the people.

The complete victory of this conference also vividly reflects the greatly improved awareness of the Japanese people. The will of the heroic Japanese people to fight against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is becoming stronger and stronger. The unprecedented peace parade in Japan victoriously arrived in Tokyo the day before the opening of the conference. The number of people participating in this peace parade totaled 22 million; traveling across mountains and rivers, passing through countless towns and villages, covering a distance of 10,000 kilometers; passing through more than 200 U.S. and Japanese military bases, arousing people everywhere to wage a tenacious struggle to abolish the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, oppose military bases, and prohibit nuclear weapons. This world's unprecedented large-scale parade deeply moved all conference participants and added tremendous strength to the conference. The Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, in such a magnificent and diverse form, powerfully proves that the peace movement, as long as it is combined with the vital interests and demands of the millions of people, and combined with the enthusiasm of the masses, can generate great power and defeat the imperialist war plans.

Conversely, if one does not rely on the strength of the people to wage a resolute struggle, but limits the peace movement only to the appeals of a few upper-class figures or salon-style chitchat, then the peace movement will inevitably be cold and deserted, and it will be impossible to force imperialism to make concessions. Every World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has been able to make significant contributions to the cause of prohibiting nuclear weapons, opposing wars of aggression, and maintaining peace, which is inseparable from the encouragement and support of the mass struggle of the Japanese people. Japan is the only country in the world that has suffered from nuclear weapons disasters. The atomic bombs dropped by the United States on Hiroshima and Nagasaki took the lives of hundreds of thousands of Japanese people and left countless others still under the threat of death and suffering. The U.S. hydrogen bomb tests on the high seas of the Pacific Ocean have poisoned many Japanese sailors and fishermen. Today, U.S. imperialism is turning the entire Japan into a base for launching nuclear wars, dragging the entire Japanese nation into a deeper abyss of disaster. Because of this, the Japanese people have consistently stood at the forefront of the struggle against the use of nuclear weapons. The Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is held continuously in Japan, naturally combining the Japanese people's resolute opposition to nuclear weapons with the wishes of the people of the world. In particular, this conference was convened under the favorable situation in which the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty had achieved a major victory. The heroic and tenacious fighting spirit of the Japanese people cannot but have a profound impact on the conference, and through representatives from various countries, bring it to the world.

The complete victory of this conference also demonstrated the direction in which the Japanese people are advancing, and demonstrated the future of the Japanese people's struggle. This conference was a grand review of the patriotic and progressive forces in Japan, and also a grand demonstration against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. The long peace march held by the Japanese people from Hokkaido in the north to Yoron Island in the south means that any reactionary force that attempts to use disguise or excuses to continue to maintain, promote, or implement the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is bound to encounter greater resistance from the Japanese people. Representatives from all walks of life in Japan at this conference fully expressed their unparalleled anger at U.S. imperialism, which is a feeling from the depths of the hearts of millions of Japanese people, and is also a force that the U.S.-Japan reactionaries can never overcome. During the convening of this conference, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and their followers organized various hypocritical and deceptive anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb activities, and even conspired to sabotage and split the anti-nuclear weapons movement. However, no matter how cunning the U.S.-Japan reactionaries are, it is of no avail. From their long painful experience of being occupied by the U.S. military, the Japanese people have deeply understood that as long as the U.S. aggressive forces do not withdraw from Japan, and as long as the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is not abolished, Japan will not be able to get rid of the enslavement of U.S. imperialism for a single day, and will not be able to get rid of the disaster of war for a single day. The recent arrival of a U.S. missile submarine capable of launching nuclear weapons at the Yokosuka base in Japan, which was met with fierce protests from the Japanese people, is clear proof. Japan is a great nation. The Japanese people yearn for independence and freedom and will never allow those who dropped the first atomic bomb on their heads to bully them at will. The Japanese people's struggle will surely continue to develop. Now, the Japanese people have found a good way to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, oppose the U.S. military base, and drive away the U.S. imperialist aggression forces under the current circumstances. That is, to unite all the broadest forces except U.S. imperialism and its agents, and conduct a national mass struggle against U.S. imperialism and its agents. We believe that the Japanese people will continue to use and develop this method until the U.S. imperialist aggression forces are completely driven out of Japan. The future of the Japanese people is bright and is full of hope.

At this Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the delegation sent by the Chinese people to participate in the Tokyo Conference made a certain contribution to the successful completion of the conference. Since the Kishi Nobusuke government insisted on implementing a policy of hostility towards China and deliberately sabotaging the friendly relations between the people of China and Japan, visits to Japan by Chinese people's organizations have been interrupted for two years and two months. After the collapse of the Kishi Nobusuke government, this delegation, headed by Comrade Liu Ningyi, chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, went to Japan to participate in the 10th anniversary celebration of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs; expressing the greetings of the 650 million Chinese people to the fighting Japanese people, and expressing the Chinese people's firm belief that a brave nation like Japan that loves independence and freedom will never be controlled by foreign countries for a long time. They will certainly be able to defeat the common enemy of the people of China and Japan, U.S. imperialism, and establish an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral country. Therefore, the arrival of the Chinese delegation in Japan aroused widespread attention from all walks of life in Japan. Many Japanese groups and individuals requested to meet with the Chinese delegation. The broad masses of the Japanese people wish for Sino-Japanese friendship, demand that the anti-China policy pursued since the Kishi Nobusuke era, which has not yet been changed, be stopped, and immediately improve relations with China. People from all walks of life in Japan have also requested the Japanese government to extend the term of the Chinese delegation's visit to Japan. However, as of the time this newspaper went to press, the Japanese government still refused this legitimate request of the Japanese people. Japanese public opinion regards whether the Ikeda government approves the extension of the Chinese delegation's visit to Japan as a "touchstone" for its sincerity in improving Sino-Japanese relations. Mr. Akira Kazami, head of the Japanese delegation attending the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said well: "The Ikeda government's attitude of not allowing the extension of the Chinese delegation's visa shows that it is taking a hostile attitude towards China, and that it is attempting to obstruct the development of friendly relations between the two peoples." The Japanese people, who have tasted the bitter fruits of Kishi Nobusuke's anti-China policy, feel this way is completely reasonable.

The Chinese people have always supported the struggle of the Japanese people, and regard the victory of the Japanese people as their own victory. The basis of this mutual support and joint struggle is the common interests of the two peoples in safeguarding peace and security. Mr. Inejiro Asanuma is right, "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan." We believe that the people of China and Japan, separated only by a strip of water, should be friendly from generation to generation, and that Sino-Japanese friendship is one of the important factors for world peace. The friendly relations between the people of China and Japan can never be undermined by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. The fact that the Chinese representatives received such a warm and friendly welcome from the Japanese people during their visit to Japan is clear proof. The people of China and Japan will surely continue to work together in the struggle to implement the resolutions of this conference and oppose the common enemy—U.S. imperialism!

### 加强人民斗争，击败和平的敌人

    加强人民斗争，击败和平的敌人
    第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会，9日在全体会议上一致通过东京宣言、总决议和国际共同行动建议书以后，已经胜利闭幕。这次大会，参加的有全世界各大洲二十八个国家和十个国际组织的代表，有一万名日本全国各城市和乡村的代表，确实是一个战斗的世界大会，是一个在广泛基础上反美和平力量的大检阅。
    在这次大会上，日本和世界各国的和平力量进行了热烈的讨论，交流了和平运动的经验，明确认识到美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策威胁着世界和平，是不同社会制度国家之间和平共处的障碍。锡兰代表特加·古纳瓦达纳说，“美国企图用来绊住世界的军事基地网是核战争危险的主要根源。美国还蹂躏设有美国基地的国家的主权。”她揭露美国的死亡商人正在力图把自己装扮得像和平的朋友；呼吁与会者同假装为和平和自由的保护者的战争势力进行强有力的斗争。印度代表曼苏尔·吉拉尼说：只要有帝国主义，就不会有稳定的世界和平。智利代表何塞·万徒勒里说，在拉丁美洲造成战争威胁的是美帝国主义。日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎强调指出，对日本人民来说，只有废除美国在日本的一切基地和美日军事同盟条约，真正的和平才能有保证。苏丹代表艾哈迈德·穆罕默德·凯尔指出，美帝国主义是亚非各国和世界各国人民的共同敌人，他要求各大洲爱好和平的各国人民团结起来反对他们的共同敌人美帝国主义。
    在这次大会上，各国代表还就世界和平的取得，必须依靠人民斗争的观点，统一了认识。正如这次大会通过的“东京宣言”所正确反映的：“为了实现不同社会制度国家之间的和平共处和抗议侵略和战争，世界各国人民愈来愈强烈地要求禁止原子弹和氢弹、要求全面裁军、废除军事同盟条约和取消外国军事基地。世界各国人民的这些要求，应该而且必定能够通过对于拒绝所有这一切要求的以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义势力的坚决斗争，得到实现。”大会强调争取民族独立的运动是世界和平事业的重要组成部分。印度尼西亚代表说，和平运动和民族独立运动是分不开的，日本人民反对新“安全条约”的斗争正是最有力的例子。“东京宣言”写道，“我们现在生活在被压迫的民族和人民争取解放这么一个人类历史上空前的时代。为了这一伟大的事业，争取和平和各国人民的独立的运动正在牢牢团结地发展着。”
    在这次大会上，我国周恩来总理关于在亚洲和太平洋地区建立无核武器地区的和平倡议获得了强烈的反应。与会代表特别是亚洲国家的代表表示全力支持。印度尼西亚代表认为周总理的和平倡议完全符合万隆原则。全体亚洲和太平洋地区人民都会支持这项倡议，因为它对于各国人民有利。锡兰代表认为周总理的和平倡议反映了亚洲人民的共同要求。它是真假和平的试金石，凡是真正要求和平的人，都应当接受这项建议。
    第六届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会通过的总决议，充分反映了与会各国代表决心为维护世界和平，同以美国为首的帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策进行针锋相对的斗争。总决议强烈谴责美帝国主义的战争阴谋，呼吁亚洲各国人民和全世界的和平力量同日本人民紧密团结，为禁止核武器、为废除日美军事同盟条约和制止复活日本军国主义而展开一致斗争，加强和平运动。总决议呼吁世界各国人民反抗美国的侵略性军事条约组织，反对美国在越南南方和西伊里安等地进行的备战活动；要求在亚洲—太平洋地区和中欧建立无原子武器区；要求在亚洲和太平洋国家之间缔结互不侵犯条约；要求美帝国主义撤出冲绳、撤离台湾；要求重新统一朝鲜和越南。
    我们从这次与会代表在讨论过程中所表现的昂扬斗志和热烈精神，从大会通过的一系列决议当中，可以看出，日本和世界各国人民对保卫世界和平，是充满着信心和决心的。大会通过的各项决议，无疑将动员和鼓舞更广泛的人们起来为反对美帝国主义、保卫和平进行更加坚决的斗争。这次大会是世界爱好和平的力量的一个伟大胜利。它显示了全世界人民的觉悟日益提高；证明了帝国主义和一切反动派、包括现代修正主义在内，不论使用什么手段，要想阻挡人民群众的进步是不可能的。
    这次大会的全面胜利，也生动地反映了日本人民的觉悟大大提高。英勇的日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争意志，越来越坚强，大会开幕前一日，日本空前未有的和平大游行队伍胜利到达东京。这次和平大游行，参加的人数累计达两千二百万；跋山涉水，通过无数城镇村庄，行程一万公里；经过二百多个美国和日本军事基地，到处唤起人民为废除日美军事同盟条约、反对军事基地、禁止核武器进行顽强的斗争。这种世界上空前规模的大游行，使得所有的大会参加者深受感动，给这次大会增添了巨大的力量。日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，如此气势磅礴、形式多样，有力地证明了：和平运动只要同千千万万人民的切身利益和要求结合起来，同群众的积极性结合起来，就能产生伟大的力量，挫败帝国主义的战争计划。
    相反的，如果不依靠人民群众的力量去进行坚决的斗争，把和平运动仅仅限于少数上层人物的呼吁或是沙龙式的清谈；那么，和平运动势必冷冷清清，不可能迫使帝国主义作出让步。每一届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会都能够为禁止核武器、反对侵略战争和维护和平的事业做出重大的贡献，就是同得到日本人民的群众斗争的鼓舞和支持是分不开的。日本是世界上唯一遭受过核武器灾害的国家。美国在广岛和长崎投下的原子弹，曾夺去了日本几十万人的生命，并使成千成万的人至今还处在死亡的威胁和病痛的折磨中。美国在太平洋公海上进行的氢弹试验，曾使日本许多船员和渔民惨遭毒害。今天，美帝国主义又在把整个日本变为发动核战争的基地，要将整个日本民族拖向更大的灾难深渊。正因为如此，日本人民一贯站在反对使用核武器斗争的最前列。禁止原子弹氢弹大会连续在日本举行，自然而然地把日本人民坚决反对核武器的感情、要求同全世界人民的愿望结合起来。特别是这次大会，是在日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的爱国正义斗争取得了重大胜利的大好形势下召开的。日本人民英勇顽强的斗争精神，不能不给大会以深刻的影响，并且通过来自各国的代表，带给全世界。
    这次大会的全面胜利，还展示了日本人民前进的方向，展示了日本人民斗争的前途。这次大会是日本爱国进步力量举行的一次大检阅，也是对美日反动派所举行的一次大示威。日本人民举行的北自北海道、南起与论岛的万里和平大游行，意味着任何反动势力企图利用伪装或借口继续保持、推进或实行新日美“安全条约”都是一定要遭遇到日本人民更大的反抗的。日本各阶层的代表在这次大会上充分表示了对美帝国主义的无比愤怒，这是发自千千万万日本人民内心深处的感情，也是美日反动派永远无法战胜的力量。美日反动派和他们的追随者，在这次大会召开期间，组织了各种各样的虚伪、欺骗的反对原子弹氢弹活动，甚至阴谋破坏、分裂禁止核武器运动。然而，不管美日反动派的手法如何狡猾，也无济于事。日本人民从自己长期被美军占领的痛苦经历中，已经深切地懂得：美国侵略势力一天不撤出日本，日美军事同盟条约一天不废除，日本就一天不能摆脱美帝国主义的奴役，一天不能摆脱战争的灾难。最近美国把一艘能发射核武器的导弹潜水艇开到日本横须贺基地，遭到日本人民激烈的抗议，就是明证。日本是一个伟大的民族。日本人民渴望独立和自由，是绝不会长期放任把第一颗原子弹投在他们头上的人们来恣意欺凌的，日本人民的斗争必将继续向前发展。现在，日本人民已经找到了一个在目前情况下反对日美军事同盟条约、反对美国军事基地、赶走美帝国主义侵略势力的好办法，这就是团结一切除了美帝国主义及其代理人以外的最广泛的力量、对美帝国主义及其代理人进行全民性的群众斗争。我们相信，日本人民一定会继续使用和发展这一方法，直到把美帝国主义侵略势力完全赶出日本为止。日本人民的前途是光明的，是充满着希望的。
    在这次禁止原子弹氢弹大会上，我国人民派去参加东京大会的代表团，对大会的胜利完成任务作出了一定的贡献。自从岸信介政府坚持执行敌视中国的政策、蓄意破坏中日两国人民的友好关系以来，我国人民团体的访问日本已经中断了两年零两个月。在岸信介政府垮台以后，这次以中华全国总工会主席刘宁一同志为首的代表团到日本去参加总评成立十周年庆祝大会和禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会；代表六亿五千万中国人民向战斗的日本人民致意，并且表示中国人民坚信：像日本这样一个勇敢的、热爱独立和自由的民族，绝不会长期被外国所控制，他们一定能够战胜中日两国人民的共同敌人美帝国主义，建立一个独立、民主、和平、中立的国家。因之，中国代表团的到达日本，引起了日本各界人士的广泛注意。日本很多团体和个人要求会见中国代表团。广大日本人民愿望中日友好，要求停止执行岸信介时代迄今未见改变的敌视中国的政策，立即改善同中国的关系。日本各界人民还向日本政府要求延长中国代表团访问日本的期限。但是，直到本报付印为止，日本政府仍然拒绝日本人民的这一合理要求。日本舆论把池田政府是否批准延长中国代表团访日的期限，看成为它有无诚意改善中日关系的“试金石”。出席禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的日本代表团团长风见章先生说得好：“池田政府不准延长中国代表签证的态度，说明它对中国采取敌视态度，说明它企图阻挠两国人民友好关系的发展。”饱尝了岸信介敌视中国政策的恶果的日本人民这样感觉是完全合乎情理的。
    中国人民一向支持日本人民的斗争，把日本人民的胜利看成是自己的胜利，这种相互支持、共同斗争的基础是两国人民为保卫和平与安全的共同利益，浅沼稻次郎先生说得对，“美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人。”我们认为，只有一海之隔的中日两国人民应该世世代代友好，中日友好是世界和平的重要因素之一。中日两国人民的友好关系，绝不是美日反动派所能破坏得了的。这次我国代表在访问日本的过程中，受到日本人民如此热烈亲切的欢迎，就是明证。中日两国人民必将在为实现这次大会的决议，反对共同敌人——美帝国主义的斗争中，继续携手并进！
