Xinhua News Agency, August 21st—The news of the safe return of the Soviet spaceship has caused a huge sensation in Western countries.

In the United States, officials have not dared to express their opinions. In newspapers and scientific circles, although some people have tried to downplay the significance of this major event, many have found it difficult to do so. The *New York Times*, in its commentary, admitted that since the first Soviet satellite went into space, both the Soviet Union and the United States have been working to solve the problem of sealed capsules returning to Earth. "This time the Russians are again the first." It acknowledged that the Soviet Union is ahead of the United States in terms of the size of the spacecraft and the technology for returning to Earth.

Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of the Jodrell Bank Experimental Observatory in Britain, said that the safe return of the Soviet spacecraft with two dogs is a brilliant achievement, indicating that the Soviet Union is close to sending humans into space. The *Sunday Times* pointed out that in the race to conquer outer space, Russia has once again moved ahead of the United States, and the path for humans to engage in their first space flight is now clearly open.

Agence France-Presse reported on the American reaction, pointing out that the news of this Soviet achievement is a "painful disappointment" for the United States. The American plan to launch recoverable animal-carrying satellites in the future is still quite primitive compared to this Soviet spacecraft.

Many Japanese daily and evening newspapers have published extensive reports and commentaries on the news. Some newspapers have even published extras. The *Mainichi Shimbun* commented that the container of the "Discoverer XIII" spy satellite launched by the United States to return to Earth weighs only 160 kilograms and is only the size of a tin can. In this regard, the United States will have to watch the Soviet Union run alone in the future.

    苏联宇宙飞船安然归来轰动西方
    美国官方人士噤若寒蝉不敢表示意见，西欧舆论指出美国的计划相形见拙
    据新华社21日讯　苏联宇宙飞船平安返回地面的消息，在西方各国引起了巨大的轰动。
    在美国，官方人士都不敢发表意见。在报纸和科学界，虽然有些人力图缩小这件重大事件的意义，但很多人发现，这是很难作到的。“纽约时报”在评论中就承认，从苏联第一个人造卫星上天以来，苏联和美国都在努力解决密封舱回到地面的问题。“这一次俄国人又成了第一名。”它承认在飞船的大小方面及其返回地球的技术方面，苏联都走在美国前面。
    英国焦德雷耳班克实验天文台台长洛佛耳说，带两只狗的苏联飞船安全返回，是一个辉煌的成就，表明苏联已接近把人送入空间的时候。“星期日泰晤士报”指出，在征服宇宙空间的竞赛中，俄国再一次走在美国前面，人从事第一次宇宙飞行的道路现在显然已打开了。
    法新社报道美国反应时指出，苏联这一成就的消息对美国说来是一种“痛苦的失望”。美国计划在以后发射的可以收回的带动物的卫星，同苏联这艘宇宙飞船比起来，也还是相当原始的。
    日本许多日报和晚报都以大量篇幅登载了有关的消息和评论。有一些报纸还出了号外。“每日新闻”评论指出，美国发射的重新返回地球的“发现者十三号”间谍卫星的容器只有一百六十公斤重，大小只有洋铁桶那么大。在这方面今后不得不看着苏联一个人跑了。
