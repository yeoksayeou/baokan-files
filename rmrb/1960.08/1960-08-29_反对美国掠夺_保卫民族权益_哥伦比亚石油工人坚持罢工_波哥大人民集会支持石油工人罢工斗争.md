Xinhua News Agency, Bogotá, 27th – The strike launched on the 23rd by 10,000 Colombian oil workers to oppose American-owned oil companies and support the struggle of oil workers in North Santander province for the signing of a collective contract is continuing to expand.

In Barrancabermeja, the oil city of Colombia, more than 5,000 representatives of oil workers belonging to various trade union organizations held a meeting yesterday to study the countermeasures and positions to be taken in the face of government threats. The meeting decided to demand that the government revoke the resolution "declaring the strike illegal" and demand the resignation of the Colombian Minister of Labor. The meeting also demanded that members of the oil workers' unions of the state-owned Colombian Petroleum Company, the American-owned Pan American Petroleum Containers Company, International Petroleum Company, Shell Oil Company, and Texaco Oil Company, etc., persist in the strike struggle until the reasonable demands of the workers of the American-owned Colombian Petroleum Company are resolved, and until the government takes effective measures to ensure the revision and abolition of contracts that are detrimental to Colombia's national interests.

Xinhua News Agency, Bogotá, 26th – The sympathy strike held by all Colombian oil workers in support of the workers of the American-owned Colombian Petroleum Company is continuing, despite the Colombian government authorities declaring the strike illegal and threatening workers with dismissal and criminal sanctions.

The workers of the American-owned Colombian Petroleum Company began a strike on August 5th to protest the company's refusal to sign a collective contract.

On the 25th, oil workers held several mass rallies with a total of about 9,000 participants, expressing their determination to continue the strike until the demands of the striking workers of the American-owned Colombian Petroleum Company are met. A union spokesperson said that the striking workers would never retreat, "because we are defending the motherland and opposing imperialist oppression."

The Colombian Workers' Confederation and the President of the Colombian Oil Workers' Federation yesterday condemned the government for taking this measure that benefits foreign companies, and stated, "The trade union movement should take more extensive new measures to support the oil workers."

More than 6,000 students at the National University of Colombia began an indefinite strike today to support the oil workers' strike.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Bogotá, 27th – The people of Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, held a grand rally this afternoon in Bolívar Square to support the oil workers' strike struggle against American oil companies and to oppose American interference in Cuba.

Five thousand people participated in the conference, holding up placards with slogans such as "Long Live the Oil Workers' Strike," "Colombia Yes, Yankees No," and "Live or Die with Cuba." Union and peasant organization leaders who spoke at the rally demanded that the government nationalize the oil industry, which is mainly controlled by American companies, and cancel the decision declaring the oil workers' strike illegal. They also protested the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Organization of American States, expressed firm support for Cuba, and called on the people to unite against American imperialism.
