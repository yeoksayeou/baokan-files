Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 21st. Anshan Iron and Steel Complex's vast number of workers, having conquered the flood disaster, are now with redoubled confidence throwing themselves into a new high tide of steel production. Some blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces that were forced to shut down in early August due to sudden rainstorms and floods have been successively resuming production since the 9th. By the 17th, all had been restarted. Other factories and mines that had been shut down or partially shut down have also successively returned to normal production. In the twelve days from the 5th to the 17th, the daily ore output of the Dong Anshan Iron Mine increased by an average of 41.7% compared with late July, and the output of concentrated powder of the Dagu Mountain Iron Mine increased by 2%, which created favorable conditions for the rapid achievement and surpassing of the pre-flood steel production levels.

In early August, heavy rains fell across the Liaodong Peninsula. The average rainfall in the Anshan area from the 1st to the 3rd reached 280 millimeters, with 80% of the rainfall concentrated on the 3rd alone, far exceeding the highest rainfall on record. As a result, mountain torrents erupted, and rivers overflowed their banks. The two major iron mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex, Dong Anshan and Dagu Mountain, located at the foot of the mountains, were fiercely attacked by rainstorms and floods, and were forced to shut down one after another on the 3rd. Immediately afterwards, a section of the Shenyang-Anshan railway trunk line was also submerged by the flood, interrupting transportation between Anshan and the northern regions and various parts of the country, preventing the inflow of fuel, raw materials, and supplies from outside. Therefore, starting from the 4th, four blast furnaces and nine open hearth furnaces at Anshan Iron and Steel Complex were forced to shut down; some steel rolling mills were also in a state of shutdown or partial shutdown due to insufficient gas after the blast furnaces shut down and the urgent task of flood fighting.

Before the rainy season arrived, Anshan City and Anshan Iron and Steel Complex had formed a tight flood control organization. After the disaster struck, all the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex, together with the people of Anshan, under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, were urgently mobilized to engage in a battle against the rainstorms and floods with a spirit of dauntless heroism. More than 1,000 workers in the transportation department's engineering system entered the flood control and rescue front from the first day of heavy rain, ensuring that every line was patrolled day and night by dedicated personnel and that every critical section was guarded by shock teams; wherever it was washed away or submerged by the flood, there were shock teams to rescue it in a timely manner, preventing the rainstorms and floods from causing further harm for even a minute. Therefore, the normal transportation of the hundreds of kilometers of railways of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex was basically guaranteed. When the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex's No. 2 water source was besieged by the flood, the workers stationed at this water source raced against time day and night to raise the river dike. A sack of mud weighing more than 200 jin was difficult for two people to carry, but Communist Party member and veteran worker Luo Yongxiang carried one sack by himself in order to race against the flood. Many people who carried soil learned from Luo Yongxiang's example and disbanded their teams. They were in their respective assigned positions. They stayed for five days and nights until the flood receded, so that this water source never stopped supplying water to the blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces. In those factories that were not directly affected by the disaster, the workers, with a high degree of communist style, adopted the method of one person doing the work of two, both adhering to production and drawing manpower and material resources to support the flood control and rescue struggle. Large steel rolling mills and six other steel rolling mills sent more than 3,000 people to support the key units in flood control and rescue. When the tailings dam of the Dong Anshan Iron Mine was threatened by the flood, the steel rolling workers of the Second Medium Plate Mill, who had just finished their night shift, immediately rushed to the scene of the accident and joined the rescue effort. On August 4, when a transmission line tower leading to the Dagu Mountain Iron Mine was about to be washed down by the flood, more than 100 people from the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex's power supply plant came to rescue the tower foundation; the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex's office departments, the Second Thin Plate Mill, and other units immediately gathered more than 200 people and rushed to the scene in the rain. After two days and one night of hard work, the tower foundation was finally strengthened, ensuring that the current to the Dagu Mountain Mine was never interrupted. The equipment department of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex and the transportation team of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex handed over the stored water pumps and some vehicles to the Anshan Flood Control Headquarters for unified dispatch, which effectively ensured the needs of key flood control.

During the most tense days of the disaster relief struggle, the leading cadres of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee, Anshan Iron and Steel Complex, and various factories and mines went deep into the forefront of flood control and rescue, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the masses day and night, and promptly discovering and solving problems in flood control. On August 4, the Shahe Pumping Station was flooded. In the process of repairing this pumping station, Zhao Xiyu, Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee and Secretary of the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex Party Committee, and Lin Cheng, Deputy Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex, personally went to the scene to solve the problem of equipment transportation. When cars could not pass, they ensured that the various materials needed were transported to the site in a timely manner by rail, ensuring that the pumping station was repaired in less than two days. Tao Ticheng, Deputy Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex and Chief Commander of the Flood Control Headquarters, climbed mountains and waded through rivers during those tense days, running around to inspect flood control work during the day, and staying in the dispatch room at night to keep abreast of the situation of various production units, so that production and flood control were closely integrated. The resolute actions of leaders at all levels greatly encouraged the masses' confidence in overcoming the flood disaster and rapidly restoring production. The Dong Anshan and Dagu Mountain Iron Mines, which had been shut down for a time due to the flood attack, were fully restored to production in less than two days.

The Party Central Committee and the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee gave great concern and support to the restoration of production in Anshan Iron and Steel Complex, and various relevant fraternal units also gave their unreserved support. Because many of the raw materials and fuels needed by Anshan Iron and Steel Complex had to be supplied from outside, after the disaster, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee immediately made the restoration of railway transportation the focus of the province's flood control struggle. In order to ensure the production of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex, railway workers and soldiers and civilians along the line quickly launched a heroic battle to repair the line, and finally restored traffic on the Shenyang-Anshan transportation line on the 7th. In order to transport "grain and grass" to Anshan Iron and Steel Complex in a timely manner, after the northern transportation line was interrupted, the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Coal tried every means to transship a large number of materials such as ore powder and coal from the coastlines of Qingdao, Xingang, and Qinhuangdao. Therefore, the raw materials and fuels supplied to Anshan Iron and Steel Complex from outside have been continuously transported from the water and land since the 6th, ensuring the rapid and full restoration of production in Anshan Iron and Steel Complex.

During the period of harm caused by rainstorms and floods, all factories and mines in Anshan Iron and Steel Complex set up two battle lines. On the one hand, they actively organized manpower and material resources to fight floods and provide disaster relief; on the other hand, they mobilized workers to adhere to production, seize the time to repair production equipment, and prepare for post-rain production increases. The workers of the Ironmaking Plant and the three major steelmaking plants took turns repairing most of the blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces during the disaster relief period; the workers of the Second and Third Steelmaking Plants launched a performance competition to overcome the "slag barrier," clearing out the slag to promote production leaps forward; the workers of the Transportation Section of the Dong Anshan Iron Mine solved the key problem of vehicle maintenance not keeping up with production, increasing the operating rate of ore-transporting vehicles by 40%.

    以大无畏的气概一面抗洪抢险一面努力生产
    鞍钢战胜洪水灾害掀起生产新高潮
    新华社鞍山21日电　鞍钢广大职工战胜洪水灾害，信心百倍地投入了钢铁生产新高潮。8月初由于暴雨、洪水的突然袭击，被迫停产的部分高炉和平炉，从9日起就陆续恢复生产，到17日止已经全部开动起来；其他停产或半停产的厂矿也都相继转入正常生产。在5日到17日的十二天中，东鞍山铁矿的矿石日产量，平均比7月下旬增长41.7％，大孤山铁矿的精矿粉产量增长了2％，这就为钢铁的生产水平迅速达到和超过水灾前的水平创造了有利条件。
    8月初，辽东半岛普降骤雨，鞍山地区1到3日的平均降雨量达到二百八十毫米，其中80％的雨量集中在3日一天内降落，大大超过了历史纪录的最高降雨量。因此，山洪暴发，河流漫堤，位于群山脚下的鞍钢东鞍山、大孤山两大铁矿，遭到暴雨洪水的凶猛袭击，3日这天一时先后停产。紧接着，沈阳到鞍山的铁路干线，又被洪水淹没了一段，使鞍山联系北部地区和关内各地的运输中断，靠外部供应的燃料、原料、材料运不进来。因此，从4日开始，鞍钢有四座高炉和九座平炉被迫停产；部分轧钢厂也由于高炉停产后煤气不足和抗洪抢险任务紧迫，而处于停产或半停产状态。
    鞍山市和鞍山钢铁公司，在雨季到来之前，就组成了严密的防汛组织。灾情发生之后，鞍钢全体积工同鞍山人民一道，在市委的统一领导下，紧急动员起来，以大无畏的英雄气概，同暴雨和洪水展开了搏斗。运输部工务系统的一千多名职工从下大雨的第一天开始，就全部进入防洪抢险阵地，做到条条线路都有专人日夜巡视，处处要害地段都有突击队员驻守；哪里被洪水冲坏或淹没，哪里就有突击队员及时抢救，不让暴雨和洪水多危害一分钟。因此基本上保证了鞍钢几百公里铁路的正常运输。当鞍钢第二号水源地被洪水围困的时候，驻守这个水源地的职工，日夜争分夺秒加高河堤，二百多斤重的一麻袋泥土，本来两个人抬都很吃力，可是共产党员、老工人罗永祥为了同洪水抢时间，一个人背一麻袋。许多抬土的人学习罗永祥的榜样，也都拆了伙。他们在各自分工的岗位上。坚守了五个昼夜，一直到洪水退却，使这个水源地始终没有中断过为各高炉、平炉送水。在那些没有直接受灾的工厂里，职工们都以高度的共产主义风格，采取一人顶两人的办法，一面坚持生产，一面抽出人力和物力支援防洪抢险斗争。大型轧钢厂等六个轧钢厂，抽出三千多人支援抗洪抢险的重点单位。当东鞍山铁矿的尾矿霸受到洪水威胁的时候，第二中板厂刚刚下夜班的轧钢工人立即赶到出险地点投入了抢险斗争。8月4日。通往大孤山铁矿的输电线路，有座铁塔眼见要被洪水冲倒了，鞍钢供电厂一百多人前来抢救铁塔基础；鞍钢机关科室、第二薄板厂等单位也立即集结二百多人冒雨赶到，经过两天一夜的奋战，终于把铁塔基础加固得坚坚实实，保证通向大孤山矿的电流一时一刻也没中断。鞍钢设备处和鞍钢交通运输队，把库存的水泵和部分汽车交给鞍钢防汛指挥部统一调度。有力地保证了抗洪重点的需要。
    在抗灾斗争最紧张的日子里，中共鞍山市委、鞍山钢铁公司和各厂矿的领导干部，深入抗洪抢险最前线，同广大群众昼夜并肩作战，及时发现和解决抗洪中的问题。8月4日，沙河水泵站被水淹没，在抢修这个水泵站的过程中，中共鞍山市委书记兼鞍钢党委书记赵希愚和鞍钢副经理林成亲赴现场解决器材运输问题，在汽车不能通行的情况下，使需要的各种器材通过铁路及时运到，保证水泵站不到两天就修复起来了。鞍钢副经理、防汛指挥部总指挥陶惕成，在那些紧张的日子里，白天爬山涉水，四处奔走检查防汛工作，夜里坚守在调度室及时掌握各生产单位的情况，使生产和杭洪紧密结合进行。各级领导干部的坚毅行动，大大鼓舞了群众战胜洪水灾害迅速恢复生产的信心，由于洪水袭击而一度停产的东鞍山和大孤山铁矿，不到两天就全部恢复了生产。
    党中央和中共辽宁省委对鞍钢的恢复生产，给予了极大的关怀和支持，各有关兄弟单位也不遗余力的大力支援。由于鞍钢需要的很多原料、燃料要靠外地供应，水灾发生后，中共辽宁省委立即以恢复铁路运输为全省抗洪斗争的重点。为了保证鞍钢的生产，铁路职工和沿线军民迅速展开了抢修线路的英勇战斗，终于使沈阳到鞍山间的运输线，在7日就修复通车。为了给鞍钢及时运送“粮草”，在北部运输线中断以后，交通部和煤炭部千方百计地从青岛、新港、秦皇岛等海岸线上转运来大量矿粉、煤炭等物资。因此外地供应鞍钢的原料、燃料，6日以来，就从水上、陆上源源运来，保证了鞍钢迅速地全部恢复生产。
    在暴雨和洪水为害期间，鞍钢各厂矿都摆开两条战线，一方面积极组织人力物力，防洪抢险；一方面发动工人坚持生产，抓紧时间检修好生产设备，为雨后增产做好准备。炼铁厂和三大炼钢厂职工，都在抗灾期间轮流检修了大部分高炉和平炉；第二和第三炼钢厂职工，展开了攻“渣子关”的表演赛，把渣子都清理出去，促进生产跃进；东鞍山铁矿运输段职工，解决检修车辆跟不上生产的关键后，使运矿石的车辆作业率提高40％。
