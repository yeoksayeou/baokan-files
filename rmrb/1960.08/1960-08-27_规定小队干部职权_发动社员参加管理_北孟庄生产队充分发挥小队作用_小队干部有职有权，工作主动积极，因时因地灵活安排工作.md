    (This report) Stipulating the Authority of Team Cadres, Mobilizing Commune Members to Participate in Management. Beimengzhuang Production Team Fully Utilizes the Role of the Team; Team Cadres Have Authority and Responsibility, Work Proactively and Enthusiastically, and Arrange Work Flexibly According to Time and Place.
    (Our dispatch) The Beimengzhuang Production Team of Shuangmiao Commune in Jiaocheng County, Hebei Province, has given the production team the authority it deserves, fully leveraging the labor enthusiasm of team cadres and commune members. This production team has a total of five production teams. Two branch secretaries and three production team leaders are responsible for leading each production team, eating, living, working, and discussing with commune members to earnestly help the team do a good job. Production team cadres hold meetings every five to six days to study the situation and arrange work, and then go to the teams they are responsible for to implement them.
    Only by earnestly helping the team solve problems, but never taking over and doing everything for them, can the initiative and enthusiasm of the team cadres be fully utilized. Deputy Captain Meng Zhaoling is assigned to take charge of the second team. Whenever he encounters something, he always tells the team leader, Mi Jiangcai, to be responsible for handling it. He said, "The team's affairs should all be resolved by the team cadres. If they can't resolve them, then we help them come up with ideas. We can't take over and do everything for them." The cadres of this production team believe that this approach has three advantages: first, it can further stimulate the enthusiasm of the team leader; second, it can improve the team leader's ability to handle affairs; and third, it can establish the team leader's leadership authority among the commune members.
    To give full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the production team, the work of the production team should not be restricted too much. Based on this principle, the Beimengzhuang Production Team strictly divided the scope of authority between the production team and the production team. With clear authority, the team will not passively "wait to hear from the production team," but will boldly carry out work within its own scope of authority, and can arrange production in a way that is appropriate to the time, place, people, and specific situation. Regarding the authority of the production team and the production team, in accordance with the principle of unified leadership and decentralized management, it can be summarized as "Five Unifications," "Four Freedoms" (that is, the rights given by the production team to the team), and "Three Adherences." "Five Unifications" are: the production team uniformly formulates planting plans, uniformly arranges labor, uniformly manages grain, uniformly distributes it, and uniformly manages finances. "Four Freedoms" are: 1. Under the principle of completing the crop planting area assigned by the production team, except for high-yield fields, the team can determine its own planting plan for other land; 2. Livestock and farm implements are fed, kept, and used by the team on the premise of maintaining their value; 3. The team makes specific arrangements for farm work and labor deployment in accordance with the opinions of the production team, based on the agricultural season and specific circumstances. When the production team needs to transfer labor, it must obtain the consent of the team. Some labor quotas are revised by the team based on specific circumstances; 4. The canteen is managed by the team, and the production team distributes food rations every ten days according to the prescribed quota. The team makes specific arrangements for meals, and savings are kept by the team. "Three Adherences" are: adhere to the "three guarantees and one reward" system, adhere to equivalent exchange, and adhere to timely advance distribution.
    For more than a year, the Beimengzhuang Production Team has conscientiously implemented these regulations. The enthusiasm of team cadres and commune members has been greatly stimulated, and a new situation of full attendance and high work efficiency has emerged. Not only can various farm works be completed ahead of schedule with guaranteed quality and quantity, but the livestock of each team are well-fed and strong, eliminating abnormal deaths; farm implements are wiped clean and rarely lost; and the canteen vigorously engages in household production, eating well and healthily, which is both hygienic and economical. The cadres of the production team are no longer as busy and chaotic as they used to be, because the responsibilities of various tasks are clear and everyone is in charge, and they have time to participate in production and study.
    According to the experience of the cadres of the Beimengzhuang Production Team, to lead collective production well, it is necessary to achieve "everyone as master" and fully mobilize the broad masses of commune members to participate in democratic management. For the past six months, the production team has insisted on holding a meeting of commune member representatives every month. All major issues such as the establishment of systems, the formulation of plans, the use of funds, and the distribution of income are fully mobilized for discussion and decision-making by the masses of commune members. At the same time, party members and cadres often adopt methods such as visiting homes, contacting households individually, and chatting in the fields and canteens to understand the opinions and requirements of the masses at any time and to better manage the production team's operations.
    At present, the Party branch and the five production teams of Beimengzhuang Production Team have universally established "old peasant advisory groups." The production team's "old peasant advisory group" has a total of six people, and the old peasant advisors of each team are generally two to three people. The old peasants who participate in the advisory group are all poor and lower-middle peasants democratically elected by the commune members. They have rich production experience, care about collective undertakings, and have high prestige among the masses. The Party branch of the production team and the team committees of each team invite them to participate in meetings to arrange current farm work or discuss and deploy new tasks, widely absorbing their opinions to guide current production. Branch Secretary Wang Weizhi has a deep understanding of this mass line working method. He said, "When we lead production, we must listen to the words of the higher-level Party committee and also listen to the words of the masses, because every policy of the Party starts from the wishes of the masses and is formulated based on the interests of the masses. Only by listening to the words of both the higher-level Party committee and the commune members can we be a truly good servant who serves the people wholeheartedly." It is precisely because of this that they always regard some old peasants and active members of the masses as their "three heads and six arms" in leading production, relying on them and humbly seeking advice on everything.
    This production team has a tightly organized line of life, managing almost all the life affairs of the commune members, such as clothing, food, housing, transportation, and educating children. The life line is personally led by Branch Secretary Wang Weizhi, who regularly conducts inspections, continuously solicits the opinions of commune members, and continuously improves work, which is deeply supported by the commune members. The most important things in life are eating and dressing. In addition to doing a good job in the canteen, a sewing, washing, and dyeing team and a clothing processing factory have also been established to be responsible for washing the clothes and bedding of the commune members and making shoes and mending socks.
    With a tightly organized line of life, coupled with the fact that the branch and team cadres often care about the lives of the commune members, frequently check, and often inquire, commune members can get help from the branch and the production team when they encounter major events. Last year, the attendance rate of women was 80%, and now the attendance rate often remains at 100%.

    规定小队干部职权　发动社员参加管理
    北孟庄生产队充分发挥小队作用
    小队干部有职有权，工作主动积极，因时因地灵活安排工作
    本报讯　河北交河县双庙公社北孟庄生产队给小队应有的职权，充分发挥了小队干部和社员的劳动积极性。这个生产队共有五个生产小队。两个支部书记、三个生产队长，分别包干领导各个生产小队，他们和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，切实帮助小队搞好工作。生产队干部每五至六天开一次会，研究情况，布置工作，然后到所包的小队去贯彻执行。
    认真地帮助小队解决问题，但绝不是包办代替，才能充分发挥小队干部的主动性、积极性。副队长孟昭苓分工包第二小队，他遇到一些事情，总是告诉小队长米江才，由米江才负责处理。他说：“小队的事情，都应该由小队干部解决，解决不了的，再帮助他们出主意，不能大包大揽。”这个生产队的干部认为这样作有三点好处：一、可以进一步发挥小队长的积极性；二、可以提高小队长的办事能力；三、能在社员中为小队长树立领导威信。
    要发挥生产小队的主动性积极性，对生产小队的工作就不能限制过死。根据这个原则，北孟庄生产队严格划分了生产队和生产小队的职权范围。职权明确，小队才不会被动地“等着听生产队的”，而根据自己的职权范围大胆地进行工作，能因地因时因活因人制宜地安排生产。关于生产队和生产小队的职权，按照统一领导、分级管理的原则，归纳起来有“五统”、“四放”（即生产队给小队的权利）、“三坚持”。“五统”是：生产队统一制订种植计划，统一劳力安排，统一粮食管理，统一进行分配，统一管理财务。“四放”是：一、在完成生产队分配的作物种植面积的原则下，除丰产方外，其他土地由小队自己确定种植计划；二、牲畜和农具在保本保值的前提下，由小队喂养、保管、使用；三、农活和劳力支配，根据农事季节和具体情况，小队遵照生产队的意见进行具体安排，生产队需要抽调劳力时，必须征得小队同意。部分劳动定额由小队根据具体情况修订；四、食堂由小队负责管理，生产队按规定指标十天发给一次口粮。伙食由小队具体安排，节约归己。“三坚持”是：坚持三包一奖，坚持等价交换，坚持按时预分。
    一年多以来，北孟庄生产队认真地执行了这些规定。小队干部和社员们的积极性大大发挥，出现了出全勤、高工效的新局面。不仅各项农活能保质保量提前完成，各队的牲口喂得肥壮，消灭了非正常死亡现象；农具擦得干干净净，很少丢失；食堂大搞家底生产，吃得饱，吃得好，既卫生，又节约。生产队的干部们也因为各项工作责任明确，事事有人管，再不像过去那样忙乱，有了参加生产和学习的时间。
    根据北孟庄生产队干部的经验，要领导好集体生产，必须要做到“众人当家”，充分发动广大社员参加民主管理。半年来，生产队每月坚持召开一次社员代表会，凡是制度的建立、计划的制定、资金的使用和收益的分配等重大问题，都是充分发动社员群众讨论决定。同时，党员干部还经常采取登门拜访、分户联系、地头和食堂谈心等方法，随时了解群众的意见、要求，更好地搞好生产队的经营管理工作。
    目前，北孟庄生产队党支部和五个生产小队普遍设立了“老农顾问组”。生产队的“老农顾问组”共计六人，各个小队的老农顾问一般都是二至三人，参加顾问组的老农，都是社员民主选举出的贫农、下中农，他们有着丰富的生产经验，也关心集体事业，在群众中的威望也很高。生产队党支部和各个小队队委会，开会安排当前农活，或讨论布置新的工作任务，都邀请他们参加，广泛吸收他们的意见，指导当前生产。支部书记王维芝对这种群众路线的工作方法有着深刻体会。他说：“我们领导生产，既要听上级党委的话，又要听群众的话，因为党的每一项方针政策，都是从群众的愿望出发，和根据群众的利益制定的，只有既听上级党委的话，又听社员群众的话，才算是一个真正为人民群众服务的好勤务员。”正是因为这样，所以他们领导生产总是把一些老农和群众积极分子，当做自己的“三头六臂”，依靠他们，事事虚心请教。
    这个生产队有一条组织严密的生活战线，把社员的衣、食、住、行、教育孩子等等生活事务，几乎全部管理起来。生活战线由支部书记王维芝同志亲自挂帅，经常进行检查，不断征求社员的意见，不断改进工作，深受社员拥护。生活中最主要的是吃和穿。除了搞好食堂工作之外，还建立了缝纫洗染组和被服加工厂，负责给社员拆洗衣服被褥，做鞋补袜。
    有了一条组织严密的生活战线，再加支部和队干部们经常关心社员生活，勤检查，常询问，社员遇有大事，都能得到支部和生产队的帮助。去年，妇女的出勤率是80％，现在出勤率经常保持100％。
