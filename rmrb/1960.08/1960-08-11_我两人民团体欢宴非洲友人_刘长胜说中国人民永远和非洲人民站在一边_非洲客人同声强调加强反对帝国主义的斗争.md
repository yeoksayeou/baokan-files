Xinhua News Agency, 10th August. The Chinese-African People's Friendship Association and the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee held a reception this evening to warmly welcome foreign guests from various African countries who are currently visiting China.

    The foreign guests included: the Angolan People's Liberation Movement (Portuguese) delegation to China, the African Independence Party of Portuguese Guinea delegation to China, Momanki Dunasian Felix and Ongeesaga Célestin, members of the Political Bureau of the Congolese African Solidarity Party, the Sierra Leone delegation led by Ibrahin Kargbo, and the delegation of the Federation of Black African Students in France led by Diko Amadou Abdoul.

    Liu Changsheng, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, warmly welcomed the African friends in his speech at the reception. He said: "The 650 million Chinese people will always stand on the side of the African people and will always be the close comrades-in-arms of the African people in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism!"

    Liu Changsheng said that the African people's liberation movement is flourishing and developing rapidly, and the call for the complete realization of national independence has resounded throughout the African continent. The imperialist colonial rule in Africa is disintegrating. In the heart of Africa, the people of the Republic of Congo are fighting heroically to oppose imperialist armed aggression and divisive conspiracies, and to defend national independence and territorial sovereignty. Under the increasingly high tide of the African national liberation movement, and inspired by the Algerian national liberation struggle and the patriotic and just struggle of the Congolese people, the people of Portuguese Angola and Portuguese Guinea have become increasingly united and are waging a resolute struggle to break away from the extremely dark fascist rule of the Portuguese colonialists and to win national independence. The new, frantic, and savage repressive measures taken by the Portuguese colonialists with the support of U.S. imperialism are arousing increasingly strong resistance from the people, who are now launching various forms of struggle. The Angolan people have taken up arms to resist the enemy. In the face of the long-term and resolute struggle of the people of countries such as Cameroon, the Mali Federation, Dahomey, Upper Volta, Chad, and Sierra Leone, the imperialists and colonialists have had to allow these countries to declare independence. The Chinese people are overjoyed and inspired by every victory won by the people of Algeria, the people of Congo, the people of Portuguese African colonies, and the people of other African countries in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism, and they hold in high esteem the heroic acts they have displayed in this struggle.

    Liu Changsheng said that in the face of the increasingly high tide of the African national liberation movement, the old colonialists, in addition to taking savage repressive measures against the people, have also had to make some concessions on the surface in order to continue their colonial rule in disguised forms. U.S. imperialism, this neo-colonialist, on the one hand, actively colludes with the old colonialists to suppress the colonial people, and on the other hand, it plays various conspiracies and vigorously infiltrates Africa, attempting to replace the old colonialists. However, the increasingly awakened African people have become increasingly aware of the conspiracies and tricks of the new and old colonialists from their own struggles, and they recognize that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the African people and the people of the world. The African national liberation movement is an integral part of the entire world people's opposition to imperialism and colonialism and their defense of world peace. The Chinese people have always firmly supported the just struggle of the African people for national independence.

    Liu Changsheng said that we firmly believe that today, with the unprecedentedly powerful strength of the African people, the struggle of the people of African countries for national independence, with the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world, will surely achieve final victory!

    The head of the Angolan People's Liberation Movement (Portuguese) delegation to China spoke. He said that the warm reception they received in China symbolized the unity and friendship between the Chinese and African people. He said that the friendship of the Chinese people to the African people is a fighting friendship, and the Chinese people support the African people's struggle against colonial oppression and against imperialist interference. He pointed out that the imperialist aggression against Congo has aroused the anger of the African people and has given the African people an opportunity to unite. He believes that the people of all countries have a common enemy, and that enemy is imperialism headed by the United States. He said that the Chinese and African people must strengthen their unity and jointly eliminate imperialism.

    The head of the African Independence Party of Portuguese Guinea delegation to China said in his speech that history cannot be reversed, and history is created by the people. The characteristic of today's era is that the people of all countries are struggling to destroy imperialism. The people of Portuguese Guinea are joining hands with the Chinese people to carry out this struggle unceasingly and steadfastly. The people of all countries are using common struggles to build the foundation of friendship between them. He proposed a toast to the great achievements made by the Chinese people and to strengthening the friendship between the Chinese people and the African and Portuguese Guinea people.

    Moses Barney Khow, a member of the Sierra Leone delegation, first asked everyone to stand up and observe a minute of silence for the Congolese people who died in the anti-colonialist struggle. He said that the Asian and African people should unite as one, for in unity there is strength, and only through unity can imperialism be overthrown. He said that Africa is moving forward, and the African people must kick imperialism and colonialism out of Africa. He expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for their support for the African people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

    Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, delivered a speech at the reception. He said that the unity of the Asian and African people not only foreshadows the final collapse of imperialist and colonialist rule in Asia and Africa, but also symbolizes the brightness and future of the world. He warmly congratulated the African people on the victories they have already achieved in the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle, and wished the African people's struggle a final victory.

    Also present at the reception were Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, and people from all walks of life, including Chu Tunan, Li Zhuchen, Hou Debang, Sa Kongliao, Mei Lanfang, Rong Yiren, Le Songsheng, Da Punsheng, Wang Yunsheng, Ke Boren, Chen Hansheng, He Ying, and others.

    我两人民团体欢宴非洲友人
    刘长胜说中国人民永远和非洲人民站在一边
    非洲客人同声强调加强反对帝国主义的斗争
    新华社10日讯　中国非洲人民友好协会和中国亚非团结委员会今天晚间举行酒会，热烈欢迎正在我国访问的非洲各国的外宾。
    这些外宾是：葡属安哥拉人民解放运动访华代表团，葡属几内亚非洲独立党访华代表团，刚果非洲团结党政治局委员莫芒基·杜纳西安·菲力斯和昂盖萨加·塞勒斯坦，以依伯拉欣·卡尔格波为首的塞拉勒窝内代表团和以迪柯·阿马杜·阿卜杜勒为首的黑非洲留法学生联合会代表团。
    中国非洲人民友好协会会长刘长胜在酒会上讲话热烈欢迎非洲的朋友们。他说：“六亿五千万中国人民将永远站在非洲人民的一边，永远是非洲人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争中的亲密战友！”
    刘长胜说，非洲人民解放运动正在蓬蓬勃勃地迅速发展，要求彻底实现民族独立的呼声响彻了非洲大陆，帝国主义在非洲的殖民统治正在瓦解。在非洲的心脏，刚果共和国的人民正在为反对帝国主义的武装侵略和分裂阴谋，保卫民族独立和领土主权完整而进行英勇的战斗。在整个非洲民族解放运动浪潮日益高涨的形势下，在阿尔及利亚民族解放斗争和刚果人民爱国正义斗争的鼓舞下，葡属安哥拉和葡属几内亚的人民已经日益紧密地团结起来，为摆脱葡萄牙殖民主义者极端黑暗的法西斯统治，争取民族独立而进行坚决斗争。葡萄牙殖民主义者在美帝国主义支持下所采取的新的疯狂野蛮镇压措施，正激起人民越来越强烈的反抗，现在人民正在展开各种形式的斗争，安哥拉人民已纷纷拿起武器抗击敌人。在喀麦隆、马里联邦、达荷美、上沃尔特、乍得和塞拉勒窝内等国人民长期的坚决的斗争下，帝国主义和殖民主义者已不得不允许这些国家宣布独立。中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民、刚果人民、葡属非洲殖民地人民以及其他非洲各国人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中所取得的每一个胜利而感到欢欣鼓舞，并对他们在这一斗争中所表现的英勇行为怀着崇高的敬意。
    刘长胜说，面对着非洲日益高涨的民族解放运动，老殖民主义者除了对人民采取野蛮镇压措施以外，也不得不在表面上作出某些让步姿态，以便以变相形式继续他们的殖民统治。美帝国主义这个新殖民主义者它一方面积极勾结老殖民主义者对殖民地人民进行镇压，另一方面又玩弄各种阴谋手法，大举渗入非洲，企图取老殖民主义者的地位而代之。但是，日益觉悟的非洲人民已经从他们的亲身斗争中越来越清楚地认识到新老殖民主义者的阴谋诡计，认识到美帝国主义是非洲人民和全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。非洲的民族解放运动是整个世界人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义保卫世界和平不可分割的一部分。中国人民一贯坚决支持非洲人民争取民族独立的正义斗争。
    刘长胜说，我们坚信，在非洲人民力量空前强大的今天，非洲各国人民争取民族独立的斗争，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，一定能够取得最后的胜利！
    葡属安哥拉人民解放运动访华代表团负责人讲话。他说，他们在中国受到的盛情接待，象征着中国和非洲人民的团结和友谊。他说，中国人民对非洲人民的友谊是战斗的友谊，中国人民声援非洲人民反对殖民主义压迫和反对帝国主义干涉的斗争。他指出，帝国主义侵略刚果，引起了非洲人民的愤怒，给了非洲人民以团结的机会。他认为，各国人民有一个共同的敌人，这个敌人就是以美国为首的帝国主义。他说，中国人民和非洲人民必须加强团结，共同消灭帝国主义。
    葡属几内亚非洲独立党访华代表团负责人在讲话中说，历史是不能开倒车的，历史是通过人民来创造的。今天的时代特征就是各国人民为摧毁帝国主义而进行斗争。葡属几内亚人民正同中国人民一起不停地坚定地进行这个斗争。各国人民正在用共同的斗争来建立他们之间的友谊基础。他提议为中国人民取得的伟大成就，为加强中国人民同非洲人民和葡属几内亚人民的友谊干杯。
    塞拉勒窝内代表团成员莫塞斯·巴尼·考在讲话中首先请大家起立向在反殖民主义斗争中牺牲的刚果人民默哀一分钟。他说，亚非人民应该团结一致，团结才有力量，只有团结才能把帝国主义打倒。他说，非洲在前进，非洲人民一定要把帝国主义和殖民主义从非洲踢出去。他表示感谢中国人民对非洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争的支持。
    中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志在酒会上致词。他说，亚非人民的团结，不仅预示着帝国主义和殖民主义在亚非统治最后崩溃的到来，而且象征着世界的光明和未来。他热烈祝贺非洲人民在反帝国主义和反殖民主义斗争中已经取得的胜利，并且祝非洲人民的斗争取得最后的胜利。
    出席酒会的，有中国亚非团结委员会副主席李德全和各界人士楚图南、李烛尘、侯德榜、萨空了、梅兰芳、荣毅仁、乐松生、达浦生、王芸生、柯柏年、陈翰笙、何英等。
