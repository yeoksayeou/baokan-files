Xinhua News Agency, August 26th – British newspapers have recently launched a campaign to oust the Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO, American General Lauris Norstad. Several British newspapers, including the "Daily Mail" and "The Times," have recently reported news of Norstad's impending resignation. This news quickly spread throughout Western European countries, to the point where the US State Department and Norstad's headquarters were compelled to issue formal statements denying it. This incident once again reflects the intensification of the contradictions that have been developing within NATO recently.

　　America's NATO "allies" are seizing the opportunity presented by the repeated failures of American foreign policy and its declining prestige to eagerly attempt to "fill" the "leadership vacuum" of the West. The British "Daily Mail" stated on the 23rd that this is happening at a time when "American leadership…is paralyzed," and "internal squabbles within NATO have reached a dangerous point."

　　It is revealed that the mood of mutual recrimination that has long existed between the United States and some of its NATO "allies" has become increasingly intense. Western newspapers and news agencies report that some NATO member states complain that "too many Americans hold important positions." Some older colonial powers within this group, such as France and Belgium, are particularly dissatisfied with the United States' attempts to seize their colonial interests, taking advantage of the rising tide of national independence movements in Africa. They complain that NATO, controlled by the United States, has not supported them on the Algerian and Congolese issues. On the other hand, Norstad is also very dissatisfied with the fact that some member states do not fully comply with the will of the United States. For example, haggling over the establishment of American missile bases has made it increasingly difficult to realize the American plan to transform NATO's armies into atomic-equipped forces controlled by the United States, and the issue of West Germany establishing military bases abroad has not been satisfactorily resolved.

　　British newspapers are particularly enthusiastic about spreading the news of Norstad's impending resignation. The conservative "Daily Mail" first broke this news on the front page on the 23rd with a banner headline. Subsequently, "The Times," which is close to the British government, also stated on the 24th that Norstad would retire within the next year. On the same day, the conservative "Daily Telegraph" published an editorial emphasizing that the position of Supreme Allied Commander Europe "requires (the person holding this position) to have a clear mind and keen vision due to the extraordinarily close mixture of military and political tasks," and that Norstad's term has been very long, "consideration should be given to resignation" to give way to someone who adopts a "new perspective on strategic thinking."

　　After the news spread, Norstad's headquarters hurriedly came out to deny it. Its spokesperson issued a statement on the 23rd stating that Norstad "has no plans to leave his current position." However, the British "Daily Mail" pointed out on the 24th that this denial did not dispel rumors of dissatisfaction within the group. The French "Combat" also pointed out in response to the news of Norstad's resignation on the 25th that internal contradictions within NATO are deepening, and it is "undergoing a crisis." This newspaper, which is close to De Gaulle, also expressed dissatisfaction with the United States placing more emphasis on West Germany and less on France.

　　US State Department spokesman White formally issued a statement on the matter on the 24th, saying that the call for Norstad's resignation was a "hoax" "stirred up" by the British press, and he "does not intend to dignify it."

　　White called on people to pay attention to the denial from Norstad's headquarters and stated that Norstad "enjoys" the "complete and absolute trust" of the US government.

### 北大西洋集团内部矛盾激化  英报掀起倒诺斯塔德运动  美国务院赶紧发表声明进行反击

    北大西洋集团内部矛盾激化
    英报掀起倒诺斯塔德运动
    美国务院赶紧发表声明进行反击
    新华社26日讯　英国报纸最近掀起了一个轰走北大西洋集团总司令、美国人诺斯塔德的运动，包括“每日邮报”和“泰晤士报”在内的一些英国报纸，最近都接连传出诺斯塔德将要辞职的消息，这些消息很快地在西欧国家散布开来，以至迫使美国国务院和诺斯塔德的总部不得不正式发表声明否认。这件事再一次反映了最近在北大西洋集团内部发展着的矛盾的剧烈化。
    美国的北大西洋“盟国”正在乘美国外交政策到处失败而威望扫地的机会，争先恐后地企图“填补”美国对西方的“领导真空”。英国“每日邮报”在23日说，事情发生在“美国的领导……陷于瘫痪状态”的时候，这时，“北大西洋公约组织内部的争吵已经达到危险的地步”。
    据透露，在美国和它的某些北大西洋“盟国”之间早已存在的互相埋怨的情绪，已经越来越厉害了。西方报刊和通讯社消息说，一些北大西洋集团成员国埋怨“美国人担任重要职务太多”；这个集团里的一些老牌殖民国家，如法国和比利时，特别不满意美国企图乘非洲人民民族独立运动高涨的机会夺取它们的殖民利益，抱怨美国控制下的北大西洋集团在阿尔及利亚问题和刚果问题上没有支持它们。而另一方面，诺斯塔德对有些成员国不完全顺从美国的意志也甚为不满。比如在建立美国导弹基地问题上讨价还价，使得美国要把北大西洋集团的军队变成由美国控制的原子装备部队的计划越来越难于实现，并且使西德在外国建立军事基地的问题得不到圆满解决。
    英国报纸对散布诺斯塔德要辞职的消息特别热心。保守党人的“每日邮报”23日在第一版以通栏标题首先把这个消息轰出来。接着，接近英国政府的“泰晤士报”在24日也说，诺斯塔德将在今后一年内退休。同一天，保守党的“每日电讯报”又发表社论，强调北大西洋集团军队总司令一职“由于军事任务和政治任务异常密切地混在一起，要求（担任这个职务的人）具有清新的头脑和精辟的眼光”，而诺斯塔德任期已经很长，“应当考虑辞职”，让位于对“战略思想采取新的看法”的人。
    消息传开后，诺斯塔德的总部慌忙出来否认。它的发言人在23日发表声明说，诺斯塔德“没有离开他目前职位的计划”。但是，英国“每日邮报”24日指出，这个否认并没有打消集团内存在着不满的传说。法国“战斗报”25日也就诺斯塔德辞职的消息指出，北大西洋集团内部矛盾日益加深，它正在“经受着危机”。接近戴高乐的这家报纸还对美国更加重视西德而不那样重视法国表示不满。
    美国国务院发言人怀特24日正式就这件事发表声明，他说，要求诺斯塔德辞职是英国新闻界“哄起来”的“宣传”，他“不打算抬高它的身价”。
    怀特要人注意诺斯塔德总部的否认，并且表示，诺斯塔德“受到”美国政府“完全和绝对的信任”。
