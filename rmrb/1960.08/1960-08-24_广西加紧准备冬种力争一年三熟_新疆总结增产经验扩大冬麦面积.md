Guangxi is Intensifying Preparations for Winter Planting, Striving for Three Harvests a Year Xinjiang Summarizes Experiences in Increasing Production and Expands Winter Wheat Area

　　Nanning Dispatch: (From Our Newspaper) Guangxi is actively preparing for large-scale winter planting.

　　Seizing winter planting, harvesting an extra season of grain, and transforming from two crops a year to three crops a year is one of Guangxi's major measures to implement the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link" according to local conditions. The planned winter planting area for the entire autonomous region this year exceeds any previous year. Among various crops, grain crops such as wheat, potatoes, beans, and winter rice are the main focus.

　　The CCP committees at all levels in Guangxi attach great importance to winter planting. As early as May 12, the autonomous region's Party committee instructed Party committees at all levels to carefully study the experience of Bobai County in achieving three harvests a year. At the end of June, an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Autonomous Region Party Committee called on all localities to summarize experiences in reforming the cultivation system. Subsequently, various localities systematically researched and promoted the three-harvest-a-year system, deciding to further tap the potential of the land and increase grain production. In early August, the entire autonomous region formulated a winter planting plan.

　　To ensure the completion of the winter planting plan, various localities are actively raising and allocating seeds. Liuzhou Prefecture paid attention to selecting and retaining various winter planting seeds in the first half of the year. Now, in addition to green manure, broad bean, and pea seeds, the rest of the seeds are basically self-sufficient. Yulin Prefecture has adopted the method of "turning over autumn" to expand seed sources – planting potatoes after the Beginning of Autumn, which can be harvested after sixty or seventy days, thus catching up with the seeds needed for winter planting around the Beginning of Winter. Now that the busy season of summer harvesting and summer planting is coming to an end, various localities have begun to check the quality of seeds and conduct germination tests.

　　In order not to affect next year's spring planting, various localities have made appropriate arrangements in terms of planting time and land use. In most areas of Yulin Prefecture, summer planting has been brought forward by one solar term, and fields prepared for wheat and sweet potatoes have been planted in advance. In Wuzhou Prefecture, late-maturing spring harvest crops are arranged to be planted on dry land or on the mountains to avoid affecting next year's spring planting.

　　Urumqi Dispatch: (From Our Newspaper) People's communes and state-owned farms in various parts of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are focusing on preparations for winter wheat sowing before and after the summer harvest.

　　Wheat is the main grain crop in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and this year the wheat area already accounts for more than half of the region's total grain crop area. According to reports from various localities, wheat production has increased significantly, even doubling in some cases, in areas where both expanding cultivated land area and increasing per-unit yield are emphasized. In some areas affected by frost, drought, and pests, although the per-unit yield was somewhat lower than last year, the total output still increased significantly due to the large expansion of the wheat area. At the same time, the experience of wheat harvesting in various localities has also proved that the per-unit yield of winter wheat in many areas of Xinjiang is 15%-30% higher than that of spring wheat. The yield of "bao dan wheat" (wheat planted just before winter) sown near winter is higher than that of spring-sown spring wheat. Planting more winter wheat and "bao dan wheat" can also regulate the contradictions in labor, animal power, and water use during the summer harvest season and rationally arrange the layout of crops.

　　Therefore, the Autonomous Region Party Committee has decided to further expand the winter wheat area this year. After the instructions were issued, they immediately received the support of Party committees at all levels, farmers, herdsmen, and state farm workers. In most areas of southern Xinjiang, winter wheat sowing plans were implemented down to the production teams during the wheat harvest period. In northern Xinjiang, where the wheat harvest was later, winter wheat sowing plans were arranged before the summer harvest began.

　　Various localities have generally adopted three basic measures to ensure the expansion of winter wheat area: reclaiming wasteland for cultivation, increasing the utilization rate of existing land, and increasing the planting of winter wheat. At the same time, the spring wheat area will also be expanded. In the first half of the year, Xinjiang completed the reclamation of more than 8.8 million mu of wasteland. Now, various localities are seizing every opportunity to continue reclaiming wasteland. Zhaosu County had already reclaimed more than 70,000 mu of land for winter wheat sowing before July, exceeding the total area of summer harvest and sowing in the county. Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Tacheng Prefecture, and other areas with originally large land and small populations are working on land consolidation, rebuilding old irrigation canals, and abolishing wide ridges and old canals for winter wheat land.

　　In order to prepare sufficient high-quality winter wheat seeds, various parts of the autonomous region took the approach of combining cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians during the yellow ripening period of wheat, going deep into high-yield plots and seed fields, carrying out mass appraisal and registration of high-quality wheat seeds, and arranging special personnel for single harvesting, single beating, and single storage. According to recent statistics, Kashi Prefecture, which has the fastest seed selection progress, has already finely selected more than 15 million jin of seeds. All winter wheat producing areas have implemented a winter wheat high-quality seed separate storage management system. Various localities have also extracted 10% to 20% of the labor force and a considerable amount of animal power and farm implements to step up summer cultivation, transform low-yielding fields, and level the land. By the beginning of August, more than 500,000 mu of winter wheat land had been summer cultivated in southern Xinjiang, of which the summer cultivation area in Bachu County accounted for more than 40% of the winter wheat sowing area. Vigorously grasping water and fertilizer work is also a characteristic of the preparations for expanding winter wheat sowing in the autonomous region this year.

### 广西加紧准备冬种力争一年三熟  新疆总结增产经验扩大冬麦面积

    广西加紧准备冬种力争一年三熟  新疆总结增产经验扩大冬麦面积
    本报南宁23日电　广西各地正为大规模的冬种积极进行准备工作。
    抓住冬种，多打一季粮食，变一年两熟为一年三熟，这是广西因地制宜贯彻“以农业为基础，以粮为纲”方针的重大措施之一。全自治区今年计划冬种面积，超过以往任何一年。各种作物中，以麦类、薯类、豆类、冬稻等粮食作物为主。
    中共广西各级党委对冬种工作十分重视，早在5月12日，自治区党委就指示各级党委认真学习博白县实现一年三熟的经验。6月底区党委常委扩大会议又号召各地总结改革耕作制度的经验。接着各地就有计划的研究和推广一年三熟制，决定进一步挖掘土地潜力，增产粮食。8月初旬，全自治区就制定出了冬种规划。
    为了保证冬种计划的完成，目前各地正在积极筹集和调拨种子。柳州专区从上半年就注意选留各种冬种种子，现在除了绿肥、蚕豆、豌豆等种子外，其余种子基本上能够自给。玉林专区采取翻秋的办法扩大种源——在立秋后种下马铃薯，经过六、七十天以后就可收，这样就赶上了在立冬前后冬种所需种子。现在，夏收夏种大忙即将过去，各地已着手做检查种子质量、进行发芽试验等工作。
    为了不影响明年春种，各地在种植时间和土地利用上，都作了适当的安排。玉林专区大部分地区把夏种提前一个节令，凡是准备种小麦和红薯的田，都抢先插完。梧州专区迟熟的春收作物安排种在旱地或上山，以免影响明年春插。
    本报乌鲁木齐23日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各地人民公社和国营农场，在夏收前后，大抓冬麦播种的准备工作。
    小麦是新疆维吾尔自治区的主要粮食作物，今年小麦面积已经占自治区全部粮食作物面积的一半以上。根据各地汇报，凡是扩大耕地面积与提高单产同时并举的地区，小麦总产量都是大幅度地增长，甚至是成倍地增产。一些遭受霜灾、旱灾、虫灾的地区，虽然单产比去年有所降低，但由于扩大小麦面积幅度很大，总产量还是有了显著增加。同时，各地麦收经验还证明，新疆很多地区冬麦单产都高于春麦15％—30％，春麦临冬播种的“包蛋麦”产量，又高于春播春麦的产量。多种冬麦和“包蛋麦”，又可以调剂夏收作物在劳力、畜力、用水等方面的矛盾，合理安排农作物的布局。
    因此，自治区党委决定今年冬麦面积要比去年进一步扩大。指示发出后，立即获得各级党委和农牧民、国营农场职工的拥护。南疆多数地区，在麦收期间就将冬麦播种计划层层落实到生产队；麦收较迟的北疆地区，在夏收开始前就布置了冬麦播种计划。
    各地普遍采取开荒造田、提高原有土地利用率、增种冬麦三项基本措施，保证扩大冬麦面积，同时扩大春麦面积。新疆上半年共完成开荒面积八百八十多万亩，现在，各地还抓紧空隙，继续开荒。昭苏县在7月前就开出播种冬麦地七万多亩，超过了全县夏收播种面积的总和。昌吉回族自治州、伊犁哈萨克族自治州、塔城专区等原来地多人少的地区，正在着手对冬麦地进行土地连片、改建旧灌渠、废除宽埂、旧渠等规划工作。
    为了准备充足的冬麦良种。小麦黄熟期，自治区各地就采取干部、老农、技术员三结合，深入丰产方、种子田，展开群众性的小麦良种鉴定、划方登记工作，安排专人、单收单打单藏。根据最近统计，选种进度最快的喀什专区已精选出了种子一千五百多万斤。所有的冬麦产区都实行了冬麦良种分仓管理制度。各地还抽出10％到20％的劳力和相当数量的畜力农具，加紧伏耕，改造低产田和平整土地。南疆到8月初伏耕冬麦地五十多万亩，其中巴楚县伏耕面积占播种冬麦面积40％以上。大抓水肥工作，也是今年自治区扩大冬麦播种准备工作的特点。
