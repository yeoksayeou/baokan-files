    Recycling Old Parts
    Now a large number of irrigation and drainage machines are being sent to the countryside, and the utilization rate of the machines has also increased. Therefore, the wear rate of accessories and parts is greater than in the past. Commercial departments in various places should organize the recycling of these discarded accessories and parts while supplying new accessories and parts. These accessories and parts are made of good steel and copper. After the factory recycles them, some can be returned to the furnace, and some can be repaired to be as good as new, which saves both materials and manpower. At present, the production of accessories and parts for irrigation and drainage machinery cannot keep up with demand. Therefore, it is hoped that all localities will pay attention to this work and conscientiously organize recycling.

    回收废旧零件
    现在大量排灌机械下乡，机械的使用率也提高了。因此配件、零件的磨损率比过去大了。这些废旧的配件零件，各地商业部门在供应新配件、零件的同时，应该组织回收。这些配件、零件都是好钢好铜制成。工厂回收后，有的可以回炉，有的稍加修理，就可整旧如新，既节约材料，又节约人力。目前排灌机械的配件、零件的生产还赶不上需要，因此希望各地重视这一工作，认真组织回收。
