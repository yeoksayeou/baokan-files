    Tokaj: The World's Home of Fine Wine
    Hai Leng, Xiao Dong
    Traveling north along the west bank of the Tisza River, about two hundred kilometers northeast of Budapest, at the southern foot of the Zemplén Mountains, where the Bodrog and Tisza rivers converge, lie vast vineyards. This is Tokaj, the world-renowned producer of fine wine – the socialist Hungary's Tokaj. In mid-April, our Chinese journalists' delegation, bathed in the spring sunshine and greeted by the warm spring breeze, arrived in this beautiful place and visited the Tokaj State Farm.
    "Sweet and powerful, it can regenerate people, invigorate the spirit… and ignite the fire of wisdom and joy deep within the soul." The French Enlightenment writer Voltaire praised Tokaj wine in this way. The Austrian musician Schubert even wrote "Tokaj Hymn" to sing the praises of the region's famous wine. Some famous Europeans have hailed Tokaj wine as the "King of Wines." Our Hungarian comrades jokingly told us that whoever drinks this fine wine will become smarter and younger.
    The world-famous Tokaj wine truly lives up to its reputation. We followed our hospitable hosts to a village in the mountains. Then we stepped through an archway, ascended long, steep stone steps, and entered an ancient underground wine cellar, said to have been built seven hundred years ago. The corridor is one and a half kilometers long, lined with wine barrels, capable of storing 1.5 million kilograms of wine. This is not just a wine cellar, but an underground "wine city." The temperature inside the cellar is consistently maintained at around 10-12 degrees Celsius; electric lights illuminate the corridor, and centuries-old wine mold covers the vaulted ceiling. We walked about half a kilometer in the cellar, and our hosts offered us eleven different kinds of wine, which was only a small portion of their selection. We walked and drank, singing Hungarian folk songs and Chinese revolutionary songs. "Cheers, comrades!" Everyone cheered in unison, singing to their hearts' content, singing out the heart of solidarity and friendship, the songs and the aroma of wine filled this underground "wine city." Tokaj wine really made us middle-aged people feel lively and young!
    Why is the wine here so good? Our Hungarian comrades said that the grape varieties here are excellent, planted in special soil, managed properly, and there are unique winemaking methods, which make Tokaj wine mellow, clear, sweet, and powerful. Therefore, it is popular everywhere, both at home and abroad. The Tokaj vineyards are scattered on the southern slopes of the Zemplén Mountains. The soil here is composed of loess and weathered ancient volcanic rock. The slopes facing the Tisza and Bodrog rivers have plenty of sunshine and water. Over the long years, this has created excellent soil. On this soil, various excellent grape varieties such as "Furmint" are planted. The autumn here is long, warm, and sunny. The grapes can absorb enough sunshine and water nutrition in this autumn, allowing the abundant fruits to grow full and delicious. When the grapes are ripe, they are not in a hurry to pick them, postponing the harvest season from early autumn to late autumn and early winter in November. This is an important measure that has made Tokaj wine famous in the world. Picking grapes late allows them to fully ripen, and the autumn sunshine evaporates the moisture in the grapes. After being exposed to frost and invaded by special fungi, the sugar content increases, and some grapes gradually dry on the vines into raisins. After harvesting, the raisins are picked out and pressed into "grape mud." A barrel (about 136 kilograms) of new wine is mixed with different amounts of "grape mud," and it is placed in the wine cellar. After a few years, it becomes different types of famous Tokaj wine, such as "Linden Leaf," "Furmint," and "Muskotály," etc.
    During the Second World War, the vineyards in the Tokaj region were severely damaged. After liberation, the Hungarian Party and government took active measures to restore the planting of grapes, replacing old, low-yielding vines with newly cultivated ones; carrying out water conservancy construction, building drainage ditches, regulating groundwater levels, and carrying out irrigation; building terraces on the mountains to prevent soil erosion and facilitate grape planting; and establishing a grape planting and winemaking scientific research institute, as well as many technical experimental stations, to study and promote new technologies. After vigorous restoration and development, the region now has about 5,000 hectares of vineyards. To increase the production of Tokaj wine, it is necessary to further expand the planting area of grapes and increase the yield per unit area. The Tokaj State Farm here has 800 holds (one hold is about 8.55 Chinese mu) of vineyard. They are vigorously cultivating new grape seedlings in order to expand their operations and supply other places. They graft wild grape vines and excellent grape seedlings, germinate in three weeks, transplant after one year, and bear fruit in five years. The grape seedlings cultivated in this way have a high survival rate and strong disease resistance. The farm can cultivate more than two million seedlings annually. They plan to expand the grape planting area by sixty to eighty holds each year, increasing it from eight hundred holds to one thousand six hundred holds in the next few years. They are also making every effort to study and promote new technologies, learn from foreign experience, and increase grape yield per unit area. The average grape yield per hold on this farm was 800 kilograms in 1950 (average of dry and fresh grapes, the same below), and it has increased to 2,300 kilograms in 1959; the grape yield in small-area experiments averaged 4,000 to 5,000 kilograms, and individual yields have reached 8,000 to 10,000 kilograms.
    During our visit to Tokaj, the vineyard workers had already begun carefully managing the grape fields, and they were working hard to win a bumper harvest in the autumn. Every autumn, the grape harvest season is a happy festival for the working people of Tokaj, who sing, dance, and celebrate the harvest of a year's labor.

    托卡伊是世界美酒之乡
    海棱　晓东
    沿着蒂萨河西岸向北行进，在布达佩斯东北约二百公里的捷姆普林山的南麓、波德罗格河和蒂萨河汇合的地方，有大片大片的葡萄园，这就是世界闻名的托卡伊美酒的产地——社会主义匈牙利的托卡伊。我们中国新闻工作者代表团在4月中旬，踏着春天的阳光，迎着温暖的春风，来到这个美好的地方，并访问了托卡伊国营农场。
    “香甜有力，它能使人再生，精神振奋。……并且在灵魂深处点燃智慧和欢乐的火花。”法国启蒙作家伏尔泰是这样赞美托卡伊的葡萄美酒。奥地利的音乐家舒伯特，还写了“托卡伊赞歌”，歌颂这里的名酒。欧洲的一些著名人士，曾把托卡伊美酒誉为
  “酒王”。匈牙利的同志们诙谐地对我们说，谁喝了这美酒，谁就会变得更加聪明和年轻。
    世界驰名的托卡伊葡萄美酒，果然名不虚传。我们随着好客的主人来到山区的一个村庄。接着跨进拱门，经过深长陡峭的石阶梯，进入一个古老的地下酒窖，据说这是七百年前建造的。走廊长达一公里半，两旁摆满了酒桶，可藏酒一百五十万公斤。这简直不是一个酒窖，而是一座地下“酒城”。窖内温度经常保持在摄氏10—12度左右；电灯照耀着走廊，几百年的酒霉，布满了拱顶。我们在窖里走了大约一华里的路程，主人们给我们喝了十一种味道不同的美酒，这还只是美酒的一小部分。大家走一程喝一程，且饮且唱，唱起匈牙利的民歌，也唱起中国革命的歌曲。“干杯，同志们！”大家齐声欢呼，尽情歌唱，唱出了团结和友谊的心声，歌声和酒香充满了这座地下“酒城”。托卡伊美酒，真的使我们这些中年人变得活泼而年轻了！
    为什么这里的葡萄酒如此美好呢？匈牙利的同志们说，这里的葡萄品种优良，种植在特殊的土壤里，管理得法，还有独特的酿造方法，这就使托卡伊酒醇朴、明净、香甜、有力，因此，无论国内外，到处受欢迎。托卡伊的葡萄园，是散布在捷姆普林山麓南面的斜坡上，这里的土壤，是由黄土和风化了的古代火山岩组成的，面向蒂萨河和波德罗格河的山坡，有充分的阳光和水分，长远的年代，给这里造成了良好的土质，就在这种土壤上，种植着“富尔明特”等各种优良品种的葡萄；这里的秋天很长，温暖而晴朗，葡萄在这个秋天里，可以吸收足够的阳光和水分的营养，使累累的果实，长得丰满而鲜美。当葡萄熟了的时候，他们并不急于采摘，把葡萄收获的季节，由初秋推迟到深秋、初冬的11月，这是使托卡伊美酒驰名世界的一个重要措施。葡萄摘得晚，可以充分成熟，而且秋天的阳光蒸发着葡萄的水分，又经过霜打和特殊菌类的侵入，使糖分增加，部分葡萄就在藤枝上逐渐风干成为葡萄干。采摘后，把葡萄干拣出来，榨制成“葡萄泥”；一桶（约一百三十六公斤）新酒掺上数量不同的“葡萄泥”，把它放进酒窖，经过几年，就成为种类不同的托卡伊名酒，如“菩提树叶”、“富尔明特”、“木什科塔依”等等。
    托卡伊地区的葡萄园，在第二次世界大战期间，遭到严重的破坏。解放后，匈牙利的党和政府采取积极措施，重新恢复了葡萄的种植，用新培育的葡萄藤代替年代已久、产量不高的老葡萄藤；开展水利建设，修建排水渠，调剂地下水位，进行灌溉；山坡上修筑梯田，防止水土流失，便于种植葡萄；并建立了葡萄种植和酿酒科学研究所，还建立了许多技术实验站，研究与推广新的技术。经过大力恢复与发展，现在这个地区大约有葡萄园五千多公顷。要增加托卡伊酒的产量，就必须进一步扩大葡萄的种植面积，和提高单位面积产量。这里的托卡伊国营农场，现有葡萄田八百霍尔特（每霍尔特约合我国8.55市亩）。他们正在大力培植新的葡萄幼苗，以便扩大经营和供应外地。他们用野葡萄藤蔓和优良品种的葡萄苗接枝，三周发芽，一年后移栽，五年即结果实；这样培育的葡萄苗成活率高，抗病力强。这个农场每年可以培育二百万株以上。他们计划每年扩大葡萄种植面积六十到八十霍尔特，要在最近几年内由八百霍尔特增加到一千六百霍尔特。他们也千方百计研究与推广新技术，学习外地经验，提高葡萄单位面积产量。这个农场1950年平均每霍尔特葡萄产量是八百公斤（干、鲜葡萄平均数，下同），1959年已提高到二千三百公斤；小面积试验的葡萄产量，平均达到四千到五千公斤，个别曾达到八千至一万公斤。
    在我们访问托卡伊的日子里，葡萄园的工作人员，已经开始精心管理葡萄田，他们在为夺取秋季大丰收进行辛勤劳动。每年秋天收获葡萄的季节，是托卡伊劳动人民快乐的节日，他（她）们歌唱、跳舞，欢庆一年劳动果实的丰收。
