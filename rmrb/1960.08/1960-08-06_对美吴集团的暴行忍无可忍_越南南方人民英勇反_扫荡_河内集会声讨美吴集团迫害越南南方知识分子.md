Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 4th. According to reports from South Vietnam cited by Hanoi newspapers, the My-Diem group’s frantic “mopping-up” operations and the atrocities of forcing people into so-called "agrovilles" are being met with increasingly fierce resistance from the South Vietnamese people.

In May, the My-Diem group dispatched a regiment to conduct “mopping-up” operations in Da Lat Province and the Tra Bong district north of Quang Ngai Province, engaging in rampant looting, killing people, and burning houses. The masses, feeling they could no longer tolerate the My-Diem group's atrocities, rose up in resistance, killing and wounding many of Ngo Dinh Diem's puppet soldiers and punishing more than a dozen local despots who committed all kinds of evil.

At the end of May, when Ngo Dinh Diem's troops launched "mopping-up" operations in the Khon Hai area of An Lao district, Binh Dinh province, the local masses immediately warned Ngo Dinh Diem's troops to stop the "mopping-up" operations, otherwise, they would retaliate. In the face of the power of the masses, Ngo Dinh Diem's troops were forced to temporarily halt the "mopping-up" operations.

The flames of the South Vietnamese people's anger against the Ngo Dinh Diem group's policy of establishing "agrovilles" continue to burn throughout the country. In Tan Ninh district, Moc Hoa province, the people refused to execute the Ngo Dinh Diem group's order forcing them to concentrate in "agrovilles." Up to now, the "agrovilles" in this area have still not been built.

In Ben Dai township, Ben Tre province, despite the Ngo Dinh Diem group's adoption of various means of threats and inducements in an attempt to force more than 300 residents to move to the "agrovilles," the Ngo Dinh Diem group was forced to agree to allow them to remain in their original place of residence under their united struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 5th. The "Struggle Committee Against the My-Diem Group's Persecution of South Vietnamese Intellectuals" in North Vietnam held a rally here on the evening of the 4th to denounce the My-Diem group's crimes of suppressing and persecuting South Vietnamese intellectuals, and to support the struggle of South Vietnamese intellectuals and people. This committee was declared established on July 28th.

Vice Premier Phan Ke Toai, Minister of Culture Hoang Minh Giam, President of the Supreme People's Court Pham Van Bach, and more than 500 teachers, doctors, legal workers, journalists, scientists, and others from Hanoi participated in the rally.

Nguyen Xien, Chairman of the "Struggle Committee Against the My-Diem Group's Persecution of South Vietnamese Intellectuals" and Secretary-General of the Vietnamese Socialist Party, delivered a speech at the meeting. He systematically exposed the My-Diem group’s crimes of persecuting and killing patriotic, peace-loving, and pro-peaceful reunification of the fatherland intellectuals in South Vietnam over the past six years.

Nguyen Xien said that, however, the My-Diem group's threats and suppression can never conquer the fighting will of the South Vietnamese intellectuals. On the contrary, the ranks of those opposing the My-Diem group are expanding more and more. He pointed out that even some people who had cooperated with Ngo Dinh Diem had joined the ranks of this struggle.

Nguyen Xien finally pointed out that the American imperialists who are currently fostering Ngo Dinh Diem are in a state of isolation and decline. Socialism in North Vietnam is constantly being consolidated, while the enemy's ranks are disintegrating day by day. The days of the My-Diem group's brutal rule are numbered. American imperialism will surely be driven out by the South Vietnamese people and intellectuals, and the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet regime will surely be overthrown.

The meeting unanimously adopted a letter to South Vietnamese intellectuals, as well as a resolution condemning the My-Diem group's heinous crimes and supporting the struggle of the South Vietnamese intellectuals and people.

    对美吴集团的暴行忍无可忍
    越南南方人民英勇反“扫荡”
    河内集会声讨美吴集团迫害越南南方知识分子
    新华社河内4日电　据河内报纸援引来自越南南方的消息，美帝国主义—吴庭艳集团的疯狂“扫荡”以及强迫人民到所谓“稠密区”的暴行，遭到越南南方人民日益激烈的反抗。
    5月间，美吴集团出动了一个团的兵力在大勒省和广义省的茶蓬县北面进行“扫荡”，大肆抢劫，杀害人民和焚烧房屋。对美吴集团暴行感到忍无可忍的群众奋起抗击，打死打伤了许多吴庭艳的伪军，并且惩办了十多个为非作歹的当地恶霸。
    5月底，吴庭艳的军队分路向平定省安老县昆海区进行“扫荡”时，当地群众立即警告吴庭艳军队停止“扫荡”，否则，就要进行反击。吴庭艳军队在群众的威力前面，被迫暂时停止了“扫荡”。
    越南南方人民反对吴庭艳集团建立“稠密区”政策的怒火继续在各地燃烧。在木化省新宁县，人民拒绝执行吴庭艳集团强迫他们集中到“稠密区”的命令。到现在为止，这个地区的“稠密区”依然没有能够建成。
    在梹椥省本大乡，尽管吴庭艳集团采取种种威胁利诱的手段，企图迫使三百多名居民搬到“稠密区”去住，但是在他们团结一致的斗争下，吴庭艳集团被迫答应他们仍住在原地。
    新华社河内5日电　越南北方“反对美吴集团迫害越南南方知识分子斗争委员会”4日晚上在这里举行集会，声讨美吴集团镇压和迫害越南南方知识分子的罪行，支持南方知识分子和人民的斗争。这个委员会是在7月28日宣告成立的。
    副总理潘继遂、文化部部长黄明鉴、最高人民法院院长范文白以及河内的教师、医生、法律工作者、新闻工作者、科学家等五百多人参加了集会。
      “反对美吴集团迫害越南南方知识分子斗争委员会”主席、越南社会党总书记阮阐在会上发表讲话。他系统地揭露了六年来美吴集团迫害和残杀越南南方爱国、爱和平、赞成和平统一祖国的知识分子的罪行。
    阮阐说，但是，美吴集团的威胁和镇压决不能征服越南南方知识分子的斗争意志，相反，他们反对美吴集团的队伍都越来越扩大。他指出，甚至曾经同吴庭艳合作过的一些人也参加了这个斗争的行列。
    阮阐最后指出，目前豢养吴庭艳的美帝国主义正处在孤立和没落的境地。越南北方的社会主义正在不断巩固，而敌人的队伍却日益瓦解。美吴集团残暴的统治制度灭亡的日子即将来到，美帝国主义一定要被越南南方人民和知识分子赶出去，吴庭艳傀儡政权一定要被推翻。
    会议最后一致通过了致越南南方知识分子的信，以及反对美吴集团的滔天罪行、支持南方知识分子和人民斗争的决议。
