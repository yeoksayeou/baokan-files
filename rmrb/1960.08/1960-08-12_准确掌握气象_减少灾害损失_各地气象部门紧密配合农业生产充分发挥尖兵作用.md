    Accurately Grasping the Weather, Reducing Disaster Losses
    Meteorological Departments in Various Regions Closely Cooperate with Agricultural Production, Fully Playing a Vanguard Role
    (Our Dispatch) Meteorological departments in various regions are vigorously carrying out meteorological service work to actively support agricultural production.
    This summer, disastrous weather has occurred frequently, with some areas experiencing alternating droughts and floods. To overcome these natural disasters and ensure the normal growth and development of crops, meteorological departments in various regions are actively and proactively engaging in the fight against disasters.
    In the fight against drought and flood, meteorological organizations at all levels have actively carried out various aspects of service work.
    In Hebei Province's Baoding region, the meteorological department, to cooperate with the drought resistance effort, conducted a comprehensive survey of soil moisture at all levels, and promptly reported evaporation rates, soil moisture levels, and weather forecasts to the Party leaders at all levels, playing a significant role in rational irrigation, water conservation, and supporting the drought resistance effort. On June 13th, the Nanzhou County meteorological service station in Hunan Province issued a forecast of 100 millimeters of rainfall within three days. The county Party committee immediately instructed all communes to store water in high-lying fields, drain water from low-lying fields, close low-lying depressions in a timely manner, and build embankments. Due to the accuracy of the weather forecast and the timely drainage and storage, initiative was gained in combating water and drought disasters. Meteorological departments in Hebei, Guangxi, and other regions have also achieved certain results in artificial rainfall with the assistance of relevant departments.
    Based on the characteristics of this year's flood prevention efforts, meteorological departments at all levels have also actively arranged meteorological service work for large, medium, and small reservoirs. In Jiangxi Province, many meteorological service stations and outposts have been established on large and medium-sized reservoirs, and forecasts of rainfall and water conditions have been carried out. Hydrological and meteorological intelligence groups have been established in the flood control headquarters at all levels in the Korla region of Xinjiang, and a strict reporting system has been established to provide timely information on hydrological and weather changes to leaders at all levels and relevant departments, acting as their eyes and ears.
    In the fight against typhoons, meteorological departments at all levels have closely monitored the activities of the big "tiger" of typhoons, and made supplementary forecasts of typhoons at each level. On June 25th, the meteorological service outpost of Nanzhuang Commune in Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, four days before the typhoon appeared, made a forecast that the typhoon would invade, based on the typhoon forecast of the meteorological service station and the local experienced farmers' knowledge of the weather. The Party committee made timely arrangements for prevention work based on the forecast, and as a result, more than 1,000 mu of ripening rice in the whole commune were harvested two days before the typhoon hit, basically avoiding losses.
    On the afternoon of July 28th, due to the impact of the typhoon, Fuxian County in Liaoning Province experienced winds of force nine or higher and heavy rain, with a rainfall of 98 millimeters in twelve hours. Because the meteorological station made an accurate forecast thirty-six hours in advance, the Party committee made careful arrangements, reducing losses. According to statistics, 181 households in the county were evacuated from dangerous areas before the typhoon arrived, and 609 dilapidated houses were repaired.
    Before the occurrence of pests and diseases, meteorological organizations at all levels cooperated with agricultural departments to issue pest and disease forecasts and predictions, and went deep into the fields to provide services. The Gaotai Central Meteorological Service Station in Gansu Province carried instruments deep into the fields for observation, and after finding out that aphids are most likely to occur when the air temperature is 22-25 degrees Celsius and the relative humidity is 33-45%, made a forecast of the trend of aphid occurrence, and promptly captured and killed aphids on 600 mu of crops within two days.
    In order to closely cooperate with production, support agriculture, and fully play the role of a vanguard, meteorological departments in Jiangsu, Gansu, and other regions have dispatched mobile service stations and outposts at each important agricultural season, focusing on short- and medium-term disastrous weather forecasts. The meteorological stations and outposts in Nantong Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, due to reporting four heavy wind and rain events one or two days in advance on May 17th, 23rd, 28th, and 30th, the prefecture and county Party committees organized four surprise rush harvesting campaigns, mobilizing more than 2.25 million people in the whole region to rush harvest 3.86 million mu of barley and yuan wheat, promoting the progress of wheat harvesting and reducing losses. The commune members said: "The weather forecast is really good, we know about strong winds and heavy rains early, guaranteeing a bumper harvest, thanks to the good leadership of the Party."

    准确掌握气象　减少灾害损失
    各地气象部门紧密配合农业生产充分发挥尖兵作用
    本报讯　各地气象部门正大力开展气象服务工作，积极支援农业生产。
    今年夏季灾害性天气出现频繁，有些地方的旱、涝又交错发生。为了战胜这些自然灾害，保证农作物正常的生长和发育，各地气象部门正积极主动地投入抗灾斗争。
    在抗旱、防汛斗争中，各级气象组织积极开展了各方面的服务工作。
    河北省保定地区气象部门为了配合抗旱斗争，层层搞土壤墒情的普查，随时把蒸发量、墒情、天气预报汇报给各级党的领导，对合理灌溉，节约用水，支援抗旱斗争起了很大的作用。湖南省南县气象服务站6月13日发布了三天内降雨量一百毫米的预报。县委立即布置各公社高田蓄水保水，低田排渍，低水洼适时封闭，打好围坝。由于天气预报准确，及时排蓄，对抗击水、旱灾害，争取了主动。河北、广西等地气象部门，在有关部门的协助下，在人工降雨方面也取得了一定的效果。
    各级气象部门还根据今年防汛的特点，对大、中、小型水库气象服务工作进行了积极布置。江西省在大、中型水库上已筹建了气象服务站和气象服务哨许多处，并开展了雨量和水情的预报。新疆库尔勒专区各级防洪指挥部都建立了水文气象情报组，并建立了严格的汇报制度，及时向各级领导和有关部门提供水文和天气变化情况，起到了耳目作用。
    在防台、抗台斗争中，各级气象部门都密切的注意台风这只大“老虎”的活动，层层作出台风的补充预报。广东省南海县南庄公社气象服务哨，在6月25日，即台风出现前四天，根据气象服务台的台风预报和当地老农对气象的经验，作出了台风将侵入的预报。党委根据预报，及时布置了预防工作，结果在台风侵入前两天把全社一千多亩黄熟的水稻收割完毕，基本上免受了损失。
    7月28日下午，由于台风的影响，辽宁省复县出现九级以上大风和暴雨，十二小时的降水量达九十八毫米。由于气象站在三十六小时前作出了准确的预报，党委作了周密的布置，减少了损失。据统计全县在台风到来之前迁出危险地区的居民一百八十一户，修补了六百零九间不牢固的房屋。
    在病虫害发生之前，各级气象组织配合农业部门发布病虫害预测预报，并深入田间进行服务。甘肃省高台中心气象服务站携带仪器深入田间进行观测，找出了蚜虫在气温摄氏22—25度，相对湿度33—45％时最易发生的气象条件后，作出了蚜虫发生的趋势预报，在两天内将六百亩作物蚜虫及时捕灭。
    为了紧密的配合生产，支援农业，充分发挥尖兵作用。江苏、甘肃等地的气象部门，在各个重要的农事季节，气象部门层层派出流动服务台、站、哨，狠抓中短期灾害性天气预报。江苏南通专区的气象台、站、哨，由于提前一、二天报出了5月17日、23日、28日、30日四次大风雨，地县委组织了四次突击抢收运动，全区发动了二百二十五万余人抢收大麦、元麦三百八十六万亩，推动了麦收进度，减少了损失。社员们说：“天气预报真正好，大风大雨早知道，丰产丰收保的牢，多亏党的好领导。”
