Supporting Agriculture is the Central Task of Commercial Work
-- Starting from the Experiences of Tangshan City's Commercial Support for Agriculture
Jiang Huai

This year, Tangshan City suffered from an unprecedented severe drought. Thanks to the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the thorough implementation of the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, and the all-out support for agriculture from all walks of life, the entire Party and all the people launched the "Fight the drought until the heavens bow their heads, and vow to win a bumper harvest" drought resistance campaign, which brought about miraculous results. Thus, successive great victories were achieved in basically completing the spring planting tasks and increasing the summer harvest crops compared to last year. After the tempering of the drought resistance struggle, the city's commercial workers further established the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation. Through purchasing, sales, and other business operations, they specifically implemented the policy of taking agriculture as the center, made important contributions to supporting agriculture, and initially gained some experience in supporting agriculture.

Making agriculture the starting point for everything and serving agriculture everywhere is an important task for commerce.

As the "logistics department" of socialist production, supporting agriculture is a long-term and important task for commerce. This is primarily determined by the position of agriculture in the national economy and the current situation in our country. Agriculture is the foundation of the people's food and clothing, and the foundation of national economic development. Farmers are the source of labor for industry and commerce. Historically, without a certain development of agriculture, and if the agricultural products earned by people through year-round labor were only enough for the essential consumption of the laborers themselves, there would be no division and development of industry and commerce, nor would there be the formation of classes and the development of society. When discussing capitalist agriculture, Marx pointed out that "agricultural labor is not only the natural basis of surplus value within the agricultural sphere but also the natural basis for the independence of all other labor departments," and that "a certain level of development of domestic agriculture or foreign agriculture is the foundation for the development of capital." (Theories of Surplus Value, Vol. 1, p. 42) In socialist society, agriculture must also be taken as the foundation. While developing industry, vigorously developing agriculture to provide sufficient raw materials and markets for industry can ensure the continuous high-speed leap forward of socialist economic construction. Especially under the current conditions in our country, the further development of the national economy requires taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, and arranging socialist construction starting from agricultural production. Since liberation, and especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, China's agriculture has undergone tremendous development. However, the technical foundation of agriculture is still very backward, agricultural production is still greatly affected by natural disasters, and agricultural labor productivity is still not high or stable. The rate of agricultural growth still cannot keep up with the needs of heavy industry for capital, markets, and labor, the needs of light industry for raw materials, and the growing needs of urban and rural people's lives. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Our country is a large agricultural country, with the rural population accounting for more than 80 percent of the national population. The development of industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture so that industry has raw materials and markets, and it is possible to accumulate more capital for building strong heavy industry. Everyone knows that light industry and agriculture are very closely related. Without agriculture, there is no light industry." He also said: "When agriculture and light industry are developed, heavy industry has markets and capital, and it will develop faster." This is precisely the reason. How to quickly realize the technical transformation of agriculture, improve the labor productivity of agriculture, and enable agriculture to provide more grain, raw materials, markets, capital, and labor has become the central link for the more rapid development of heavy industry, light industry, and commerce.

Commerce is the link connecting production and production, production and consumption, and the socialist economy of ownership by the whole people and the collective ownership economy; it is a bridge connecting urban and rural areas. In the process of social reproduction, production, exchange, distribution, and consumption are a unified whole. Production is the starting point, and production determines exchange, distribution, and consumption. However, exchange, distribution, and consumption also have a huge reaction on production. Marx pointed out in Critique of Political Economy: "In its unilateral form, the aspect of production is also determined by other elements, such as the expansion of the market, that is, the expansion of the scope of exchange, which increases production in scale and leads to a more detailed division of labor." This shows that doing a good job in commerce and organizing commodity exchange and distribution more rationally have an extremely important role in promoting the development of production. All commercial workers must consciously take supporting agriculture as their central task, making agriculture the starting point for everything, serving agriculture everywhere, concentrating efforts, and doing everything possible to promote the more rapid development of agricultural production.

Supporting the technical transformation of agriculture, promoting the development of diversified operations, and comprehensively organizing the people's economic life are three important links in commercial support for agriculture.

From what aspects and grasping what links should commercial work support agriculture and promote the rapid development of agricultural production?

Under the current conditions in our country, industrial production departments mainly belong to the socialist economy of ownership by the whole people, and agricultural production departments mainly belong to the people's commune economy of collective ownership. Within the socialist economy of ownership by the whole people, the distribution of means of production and products is directly allocated by the state according to the needs of the entire national economy. Between the collective ownership economy and the socialist economy of ownership by the whole people, the exchange and distribution of products between the state, the collective, and the individual still retain the form of commodities. The main tasks of the commercial departments are: on the one hand, to purchase agricultural and sideline products to supply light industry departments and urban and rural people, and on the other hand, to purchase agricultural production materials and light industrial products needed by agriculture from industrial departments to supply to rural areas. Because state-owned commerce has a unified commercial network and points covering urban and rural areas, keen eyes, long legs, timely information, and wide connections, it has favorable conditions for strengthening planning, disseminating new things, and organizing large-scale cooperation. Commercial departments should fully utilize these characteristics and favorable conditions to do a good job in purchasing, sales, transportation, and storage, which can play a huge role in promoting the development of agricultural production. As Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out in the Report on the Proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy: "Commerce, as the link connecting production and consumption, industrial production and agricultural production, not only undertakes the task of meeting the needs of residents' lives and some production needs, and the task of accumulating funds for the country, but also undertakes the task of promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production."

Based on the current situation of agricultural production development and the tasks of the commercial departments, commerce should actively support agriculture from the following aspects and promote the rapid development of agricultural production.

First, fully support the technical transformation of agriculture. Realizing the technical transformation of agriculture is the material foundation for the rapid development of agriculture. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always attached great importance to the issue of the technical transformation of agriculture and regard this issue as a fundamental issue in changing the backward economic situation of our country. At the same time as proposing the general line of socialist construction in our country, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong issued a call to the entire Party to change the situation of 500 million people struggling to feed themselves, and later put forward specific requirements for the mechanization of agriculture in our country: "Small-scale solutions within four years, medium-scale solutions within seven years, and large-scale solutions within ten years." Commercial support for the technical transformation of agriculture is carried out by doing a good job in the supply of means of production.

According to the experience of various regions: It is necessary to be good at: 1. Acting as a go-between, organizing large and small factories, old and new factories to cooperate and collaborate to solve equipment and technical problems, and arming community-run industries. In the technical transformation of agriculture, implement the principle of "walking on two legs" of state-planned support and self-reliance. 2. Grasp the most important needs of each agricultural season in the local area (for example, in Tangshan City, during spring plowing and "Sanxia" production, focus on drainage and irrigation machinery, and during the three autumn harvests, focus on machinery for digging, threshing, and processing high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes and corn), assist local industrial departments in finding drawings and samples, determining models according to local conditions, and putting them into production as soon as possible to ensure that agricultural activities are not delayed. It is necessary to prevent disregarding conditions and being greedy for foreign and large-scale equipment. According to the instructions of the Central Government and the actual conditions, especially for county and community industries, the current focus should be on improving agricultural tools. Some regions, regardless of conditions, single-mindedly pursue complete production lines and systems, research but cannot trial-produce, and trial-produce but cannot finalize and put into production, causing limited technical and equipment resources to be entangled in the research and trial-production stage, affecting normal production. 3. New-style machinery and improved agricultural tools should be developed simultaneously with old-style agricultural tools. When arranging the production of agricultural machinery and improved agricultural tools, commercial departments should also arrange the production of new-style agricultural tools and old-style agricultural tools as needed as early as possible. Fengrun County organized special personnel to go deep into villages and teams to help production teams arrange agricultural production and calculate the needs for means of production. On the basis of clarifying needs and balancing supply, it made overall arrangements for various agricultural tools and organized production, with good results. 4. Supply both whole sets and spare parts, and combine supply and repair. Whole sets of machinery should be supplied well and fully, and spare parts should be supplied even better and more fully. At the same time, it is necessary to manage both supply and repair. The various counties in the Tangshan area cooperated with industry and commerce to form maintenance teams. Fengrun County alone organized a technical army of 320 people and, with this as the core, helped production teams establish 542 repair and assembly groups, forming a repair and assembly network with points in every village, adhering to the principle of guaranteeing supply, installation, and repair, taking full responsibility, and handling everything from start to finish, which had a great effect. In some areas, there is already little agricultural machinery, and the utilization rate is still low. Upon inspection, the main problems are the lack of spare parts and repairs. In this way, the entire machine is left idle, resulting in even greater waste and a bad influence. 5. Focus on the comprehensive utilization of drainage and irrigation machinery. On the principle of ensuring the needs of drainage and irrigation, focus on rice and flour processing, feed crushing, and agricultural and sideline product processing, which occupy a large proportion of rural labor, to achieve multiple functions for one machine, fully exploit the potential of agricultural machinery, and accelerate the realization of the technical transformation of agriculture.

Second, vigorously promote the development of diversified operations. Income from diversified operations accounts for a large proportion of the total income of agricultural and sideline industries. Vigorously developing diversified operations is conducive to paying wages on time, increasing commune members' income, boosting production enthusiasm, and increasing commune accumulation to raise funds for the technical transformation of agriculture. At the same time, most of the products of diversified operations are industrial raw materials, exports, and market materials urgently needed by the state. Vigorously developing diversified operations also plays a major role in accelerating national construction. Donghuangyu Commune in Qian'an County, Linancang and Hongqiao Communes in Yutian County, and Dangyu Commune in Zunhua County in Tangshan City are all areas where diversified operations are doing relatively well. Their common practices are: sending resident team cadres to implement three participations (participating in planning, participating in management, and participating in production), four samenesses (eating together, living together, working together, and discussing together), three guarantees (guaranteeing the supply of raw materials, tools, and equipment, guaranteeing technical instruction, and guaranteeing product sales), and two assistances (helping to arrange labor and helping to establish a management system centered on contracting work and calculating bonuses). The experience of these regions proves that as long as commercial departments are good at relying on the masses, using local materials, and adapting to local conditions, the avenues for diversified operations are very broad. For example, waterlogged areas can weave mats and manage fish; mountainous areas can plant trees and forests, collect grass, and mine; and plains can raise pigs and grow melons, and can also make a big deal out of plant stalks. The development of a diversified economy should implement the spirit of "relying on water to live by water," "relying on mountains to live by mountains," and "relying on mountains to nourish mountains." The situation in many regions shows that diversified operations are done well, agriculture is also done well, commercial tasks are also completed well, and the relationship between agriculture and commerce is also good. In the first half of this year, the output value of community-run industries and diversified operations in Hongqiao Commune, Yutian County, increased by 100% compared with the same period last year, the supply of means of production increased by 12 times, and the amount of procurement expanded by 9 times. Agriculture is thriving, and the amount of commerce is even more active. There is a division of labor between agriculture and commerce without boundaries. When commerce has tasks, agriculture helps to complete them, truly like a family.

Third, take the canteen as the center and comprehensively organize the economic life of the rural people. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly instructed that we must grasp production with one hand and life with the other. The more enthusiastic the masses are, the more we must care about the people's lives. How to arrange the lives of the masses well in the Great Leap Forward and boost the enthusiasm of the masses, the commercial departments bear a great responsibility. The Tangshan City commercial departments have done a lot of work in organizing the people's economic life during the drought resistance production. Summarized, there are the following aspects: Abolish the staff canteens of stores, participate in rural canteens, send down staff to be administrators, help raise pigs and grow vegetables, establish family assets, establish a planned grain consumption and democratic management system, vigorously carry out technical innovation, manage food well, and run canteens well; Take the state-owned purchasing and marketing station as the core, the rural canteen as the link, set up points in the hall, rely on grassroots cadres and commune members, reasonably distribute commodities according to the actual needs of the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled, and organize social service undertakings; Combine supply services with participation in labor, implement appointment sales, supply to the designated location, and service to the field; Combine supply services with procurement, and establish a regular procurement system by setting up points in the canteen. Yangdianzi Commune in Qian'an County adopted the method of setting eggs based on chickens, canteen purchases, regular inspections, and public announcements, and the masses consciously sold eggs as a system. The preliminary results of doing so are: reasonable distribution, convenient transactions, and satisfaction of commune members; saving labor, which is conducive to production, and satisfaction of production teams; extending the network points, both purchasing and sales are booming, and the state is satisfied.

The situation in recent months indicates that agriculture is the largest service target of commerce. Commerce has supported agriculture to the best of its ability, which has maximized the expansion of commodity circulation and the most rapid development of commerce. Fengrun, Yutian, Zunhua, and Qian'an in Tangshan City are the four counties with relatively severe drought conditions and relatively intense drought resistance struggles. According to the comprehensive statistics of these four counties, the net domestic purchases in the first quarter of this year increased by 110% compared with the first quarter of last year (of which the purchase of agricultural and sideline products increased by 94%), and the net domestic sales increased by 22.5% (of which the supply of means of production increased by 60%). This is already the speed of the Great Leap Forward, but the pace of the leap forward in the second quarter is even greater and faster. In the second quarter of this year, the net domestic purchases increased by 172% compared with the second quarter of last year (of which the purchase of agricultural and sideline products increased by 170%), and the net domestic sales increased by 82.7% (of which the supply of means of production increased by 289.6%). Why did the commodity turnover in the second quarter increase so quickly? The key is that, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, in the severe drought resistance struggle, the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and agriculture as the center was implemented more firmly and comprehensively.

Several Cognitive Issues That Should Be Clarified in Supporting Agriculture

Socialist commerce, since its establishment, has been serving industrial and agricultural production and consumers. In this regard, it has accumulated rich experience. However, as far as agriculture, which has developed to a new stage of technological transformation, is concerned, and as far as taking support for agriculture as the center is concerned, we still lack the necessary experience. Based on the practice of this period, we feel that there are several points that need to be raised for discussion.

First, commercial support for agriculture should adhere to the principle of conducting it through the commercial business itself. Engels said that commerce promotes production through "the laws inherent in the nature of commerce." The "laws inherent in the nature of commerce" referred to here refer to "purchasing," "sales," "transportation," "storage," and "rational accumulation." During the drought resistance struggle, the commercial departments of various counties and districts in Tangshan City experienced the following three situations. The first situation is that the vast majority of stores drew a portion of their staff to participate in drought resistance labor, while a portion of the staff continued to adhere to purchasing, sales, and storage operations. Their slogan was "Give way without dismounting, focus on the center and bring along other tasks, and grasp drought resistance business in one hand." The second situation is that a portion of the stores drew the majority of their staff to participate in drought resistance labor, leaving a small portion of the staff to adhere to the supply of means of production; procurement business and the supply of daily necessities basically stopped. The third situation is that a very small number of stores completely stopped purchasing and sales business, and all commercial personnel (except for those watching the doors) participated in drought resistance labor. What were the results? In the first situation, the contribution to drought resistance was great, the business developed rapidly, and the double harvest of supporting agriculture and business was realized. In the second and especially the third situations, some drainage and irrigation machinery was left idle because of the lack of spare parts or the inability to find people to repair them, and a large amount of manpower had to be used to carry water to plant seeds instead of machines; in some places, either because of untimely transportation or because the retail department was not open for the whole month, the masses had difficulty buying salt and matches; in some places, due to the relaxation of procurement work, the commodity rate of fresh eggs, fresh apricots, and other commodities was greatly reduced, which not only affected exports and urban supply but also reduced the income of commune members and public accumulation. Obviously, this situation is not conducive to production. We know that the planned and proportionate development of the national economy is an objective law that cannot be transferred by people's will. The interruption of activities in any component of economic life will have varying degrees of adverse effects on the whole. Due to the strong seasonality of agricultural production and the shortage of labor, it is necessary for commercial departments to stop some businesses that can be handled slowly during a certain period, to give way to the central work, and to draw a portion of the staff to invest in agricultural production. However, it should adhere to the principle of "Giving way without dismounting, focusing on the center and bringing along other tasks, and grasping the central business all together." In particular, seasonal means of production and necessary daily necessities must adhere to the supply, ensuring that they are supplied whenever needed. Seasonal agricultural and sideline products should also be seized in season for procurement. Experience proves that it is possible to achieve a double harvest of supporting central work and business work. The key is to have a great enthusiasm. Many central stores in Tangshan City drew more than half of their staff to participate in drought resistance labor, and the remaining staff also participated in labor during the day, combining labor with on-site goods collection, registering purchases and sales, and opening their doors for business, delivering goods to the countryside, and stringing villages together for procurement during the early morning and evening rest hours, which not only fully supported agriculture from labor to materials, completed the purchase and sales plan, but also strengthened the ties with the masses.

Second, commercial support for agriculture should adhere to the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard." Commerce is the economy of ownership by the whole people, and agriculture is the economy of collective ownership. The two economic components are basically unified, but there are still differences; anything involving the interests of the whole people and the overall interests should be handled carefully and adhere to the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard." Here, what needs to be particularly pointed out is that in supporting agriculture, commerce must adhere to the state's unified procurement policy, unified market management and price policy, and economic accounting system. In some areas, in order to solve the materials needed for agricultural electrification, the miscellaneous copper that the state stipulates for unified procurement is not handled through the commercial link, but is raised and used by the communes themselves. Some production teams exchange materials that the state uniformly procures with industrial departments, some sell them at high prices, but some commercial workers stand by and even act as go-betweens, regarding it as support for agriculture. These practices are incorrect. Speaking of the economic accounting system, the commercial department, as an independent economic department of ownership by the whole people, should adhere to economic accounting and should have reasonable accumulation. However, in individual cases, it is permissible to lose some money due to the urgent need to support production. Some comrades do not distinguish between this individual and general, believing that supporting agriculture can lose money, and even that calculating profits and losses is calculating small accounts and not large accounts, and that the production viewpoint is not strong. This understanding is certainly not comprehensive. Commerce bears the task of reasonable accumulation for the country, and the profits of commerce are turned over to the state to accelerate construction, which is also beneficial to agriculture. Conversely, if commerce loses too much money, it will affect the execution of the state's financial budget, which is detrimental to the entire construction.

Third, commercial support for agriculture must pay attention to reducing operating links, rationally organizing commodity circulation, and closely combining the expansion of commodity circulation with the rational arrangement of operating links. The expansion of commodity circulation is the result of production development, and it can promote the further development of production. However, not all commercial operations can promote production. There are two situations: one is due to the needs of production development, and the other is the result of purely increasing commercial operating links. Generally speaking, the latter situation is detrimental to economic activities and production. For some agricultural and sideline products, if they can be adjusted within the people's commune without going through commercial links, it is not necessary to emphasize that they should be purchased and distributed by commerce; for some sideline production, if they can take the form of processing, it is not necessary to take the form of selling raw materials and purchasing finished products; for some purchasing and sales businesses, if the problems can be solved through organizational work, it is not necessary to emphasize operating them. Adding an operating link will increase a series of commodity circulation costs. Marx said, "All circulation costs that only arise from changes in the form of commodities do not add value to the product. This is a general law." Marx further pointed out that in capitalist society, "The capital invested in this cost is the false cost of capitalist production." Here, we already have the material basis for completely eliminating this "false cost," and we should plan and carefully arrange the commodity circulation links, resolutely canceling the unreasonable operating links inherited from the past, and even more should not artificially increase the operating links in order to pursue operating volume. However, if commercial operations are conducive to production development, conducive to meeting the needs of the masses, and conducive to implementing the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" and strengthening the planning of commodity circulation, they must be actively and actively operated to make commercial work better serve politics, production, and the masses.

    支援农业是商业工作的中心任务
    ——从唐山市商业支援农业的经验谈起
    江淮
    今年唐山市遭受了几十年未见的特大干旱。由于在各级党
  委领导下，深入贯彻了以农业为基础的思想，各行各业都以全力支援农业，全党全民开展了“抗旱抗到天低头，誓夺农业大
  丰收”的抗旱斗争，发挥了回天之力，因而连续取得了春播任
  务基本完成和夏收作物比去年增产的巨大胜利。全市商业职工经过抗旱斗争的锻炼，进一步确立了以农业为基础的思想，通过购、销等项业务，具体地贯彻了以农业为中心的方针，对于支援农业作出了重要贡献，并初步取得了一些支援农业的经验。
    事事从农业出发，处处为农业服务，是商业的一项重要任务
    作为社会主义生产的“后勤部”的商业，支援农业是一项长期的重要任务。其所以如此，首先是由农业在国民经济中的地位和我国当前的情况决定的。农业是人民衣食之本，是国民经济发展的基础。农民是工商各业劳动力的源泉。从历史上看，如果没有农业的一定发展，如果人们终年劳动所得的农产物只够劳动者本人必不可少的消费，那就不会有工商各业的分工与发展，也不会有阶级的形成与社会的发展。马克思在谈到资本主义农业时指出：“农业劳动不只是农业范围内剩余价值的自然基础，并且是其他一切劳动部门所以能够独立化的自然基础”，“本国农业或者外国农业的一定发展程度，是资本的发展基础”。（《剩余价值学说史》第一卷42页）在社会主义社会，同样要以农业为基础。在发展工业的同时，大力发展农业，为工业提供充足的原料和市场，才能保证社会主义经济建设高速度地持续跃进。特别是在我国目前条件下，国民经济的进一步发展，要求以农业为基础，以工业为主导，从农业生产出发来安排社会主义建设。解放以来，特别是1958年大跃进以来，我国的农业是有了飞跃发展的。但是，农业的技术基础还很落后，农业生产还受到自然灾害的较大影响，农业劳动生产率还不高，也不稳定。农业增长的速度还赶不上重工业发展对资金、市场、劳力的需要，赶不上轻工业发展对原料的需要，也赶不上城乡人民生活日益增长的需要。毛泽东同志说：“我国是一个大农业国，农村人口占全国人口的百分之八十以上，发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举，工业才有原料和市场，才有可能为建立强大的重工业积累较多的资金。大家知道，轻工业和农业有极密切的关系，没有农业，就没有轻工业。”又说：“农业和轻工业发展了，重工业有了市场，有了资金，它就会更快地发展。”正是这个道理。如何迅速实现农业的技术改造，提高农业的劳动生产率，使农业能够提供更多的粮食、原料、市场、资金和劳动力，这已经成为重工业、轻工业以及商业等各行各业更迅速地发展的中心环节。
    商业是联系生产与生产、生产与消费、全民所有制经济与集体所有制经济的纽带；是城乡结合的桥梁。在社会再生产过程中，生产、交换、分配、消费是一个统一的整体。生产是起点，生产决定着交换、分配与消费。但是，交换、分配、消费对于生产也有巨大的反作用。马克思在《政治经济学批判》中指出：“在它的单方的形态上，生产这一方面也是由其它的成分所规定着的，例如市场一扩大，那是说交换范围之扩大，生产便在规模上增大起来，而愈见细密的分业化。”由此可见，做好商业工作，更合理地组织商品交换与分配，对于促进生产的发展有着极其重要的作用。全体商业职工必须自觉地以支援农业作为自己的中心任务，事事从农业出发，处处为农业服务，集中力量，千方百计地促进农业生产的更迅速的发展。
    支援农业的技术改造，促进多种经营的发展，全面组织人民经济生活，是商业支援农业的三个重要环节
    商业工作应当从那些方面、抓住那些环节来支援农业、促进农业生产的迅速发展呢？
    在我国目前条件下，工业生产部门主要是属于全民所有制经济，农业生产部门主要属于集体所有制的人民公社经济。在全民所有制经济内部，生产资料及产品的分配，是按照整个国民经济发展的需要由国家直接分配的。在集体所有制经济与全民所有制经济之间，在国家、集体与个人之间的产品交换与分配，仍然保留着商品的形态。商业部门的主要任务就是：一方面把农副产品收购过来，供应轻工业部门和城乡人民，一方面把农业需要的农业生产资料和轻工业品，从工业部门采购过来供应农村。由于国营商业有统一的包罗城乡的商业网、点，眼尖，腿长，消息灵通，联系面广，具有加强计划性、传播新事物、组织大协作的有利条件。商业部门充分运用这些特长和有利条件，做好收购、销售、调运、储存的工作，对于促进农业生产的发展，能够发挥巨大作用。正如周恩来同志在《关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告》中所指出的：“商业作为联系生产和消费、工业生产和农业生产的纽带，不仅担负着满足居民生活需要和一部分生产需要的任务，担负着为国家积累资金的任务，而且也担负着促进工农业生产发展的任务。”
    根据当前农业生产发展的情况和商业部门的任务，商业主要应从以下几个方面来积极支援农业，促进农业生产的迅速发展。
    第一，全力支援农业的技术改造。实现农业的技术改造是迅速发展农业的物质基础。党中央和毛泽东同志从来就十分重视农业的技术改造问题，并把这个问题看作是改变我国经济落后面貌的一个根本问题。还在提出我国社会主义建设总路线的同时，党中央和毛泽东同志就向全党发出了改变五亿人口搞饭吃的局面的号召，以后并为我国农业机械化提出了“四年以内小解决，七年以内中解决，十年以内大解决”的具体要求。商业支援农业技术改造是通过做好生产资料供应工作来进行的。
    根据各地经验：要善于：1、穿针引线，组织大厂与小厂，老厂与新厂挂钩协作，解决设备与技术问题，武装社办工业。在农业技术改造上，贯彻国家有计划支援和自力更生“两条腿走路”的方针。2、抓住当地各个农事季节的最主要的需要（例如在唐山市春耕及“三夏”生产用具要抓住排灌机械，三秋生产用具要抓住白薯、玉米等高产作物的出土、脱粒、加工机械），协助地方工业部门找图纸、找样品、因地制宜，确定型号，及早投入生产，保证不误农事。要防止不顾条件，贪洋贪大。根据中央指示及现实条件，特别是县、社工业，当前主要是搞改良农具。有的地区不顾条件一心追求一条龙、一条线，研究了，不会试制，试制了，无法定型、投入生产，致使有限的技术与设备力量，纠缠在研究试制的阶段，影响正常生产的进行。3、新式机械、改良农具同旧式农具要同时并举。商业部门在安排农业机械、改良农具的生产时，还要根据需要，及早安排新式农具和旧式农具的生产。丰润县组织专人，深入村队，帮助生产队安排农业生产、计算生产资料需要，在摸清需要、平衡货源的基础上，对各种农具统筹安排，组织生产，效果很好。4、整、零齐供，供、修并重。整套机械要供好供足，零件更要供好供足，同时要既管供应，又管修理。唐山地区各个县，工商协作组成检修队，仅丰润县就组织了三百二十人的技术大军，同时以此为核心，帮助生产队建立起五百四十二个修配组，形成一个村村有点的修配网，坚持包供应，包安装，包修理，全面负责，一包到底，作用很大。有的地区，农业机械本来就少，使用率还低，检查起来，主要是缺零件，缺修理，这样，整个机械扔着，浪费更大，影响也不好。5、大抓排灌机械的综合利用，在保证排灌需要的原则下，以占农村劳动力较多的米面加工、饲料粉碎、农副产品加工为重点，实现一机多能，充分发挥农业机械的潜力，加速实现农业技术改造。
    第二，大力促进多种经营的发展。多种经营收入在农副业总收入中占很大比重，大搞多种经营有利于按期发工资，增加社员收入，鼓舞生产情绪，有利于增加公社积累，为农业技术改造筹集资金。同时，多种经营产品，大部分是国家迫切需要的工业原料、出口及市场物资。大搞多种经营对于加速国家的建设也有很大作用。唐山市迁安县东荒峪公社，玉田县林南仓、虹桥公社，遵化县的党峪公社，都是多种经营搞得较好的地区，他们的共同做法是：派出驻队干部，实行三参（参与规划、参与管理、参与生产）、四同（同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量）、三包（包原料、工具、设备供应，包技术传授，包产品推销）二帮助（帮助安排劳力，帮助建立以包工计奖为中心的管理制度）。这些地区的经验证明：商业部门只要善于依靠群众，就地取材、因地制宜，多种经营的门径十分广阔。例如水区洼地可以织席，治鱼；山区可以植树造林，打草，采矿；平原可以养猪种瓜，还可以在植物秸秆上大做文章。发展多种经济要贯彻“靠水吃水”，“靠山吃山”，“吃山养山”的精神。许多地区的情况说明，多种经营搞得好，农业也搞得好，商业任务也完成得好，农商关系也好。玉田县虹桥公社今年上半年社办工业和多种经营产值比去年同期增长一倍，生产资料供应额增长十二倍，采购额扩大九倍。农业搞得挺欢，商业额更是活跃。农商之间有分工无界限，商业来了任务，农业帮助完成，真正亲如一家。
    第三，以食堂为中心，全面组织农村人民经济生活。党中央和毛主席一再指示要一手抓生产，一手抓生活，群众干劲越足，越要关心人民生活。如何在大跃进中安排好群众生活，鼓足群众的干劲，商业部门负有重大的责任。唐山市商业部门在抗旱生产中，在组织人民经济生活方面，做了很多工作。综合起来有以下几个方面：撤销商店职工食堂，参加农村食堂，下放职工当管理员，帮助养猪种菜，建立家底，建立计划用粮和民主管理制度，大搞技术革新，管好伙食，办好食堂；以国营购销站为核心，以农村食堂为环节，就堂设点，依靠基层干部和社员群众，根据老弱病残实际需要，合理分配商品，组织社会服务事业；供应服务与参加劳动相结合，实行预约售货，供应到方，服务到田；供应服务与收购相结合，通过食堂设点，建立经常的收购制度。迁安县杨店子公社采取以鸡定蛋，食堂收购，定期检查，张榜公布的办法，群众自觉出售已形成制度。这样做的初步结果是：分配合理，买卖方便，社员满意；节省劳动，有利生产，生产队满意；网点下伸，购销两旺，国家满意。
    几个月来的情况指明：农业是商业的最大服务对象，商业尽一切可能支援了农业，也就最大限度地扩展了商品流通，最迅速地发展了商业。唐山市丰润、玉田、遵化、迁安是旱情比较严重，抗旱斗争比较剧烈的四个县，根据这四个县的综合统计，今年第一季度比去年第一季度国内纯购进增长了110％（其中农副产品采购增长94％），国内纯销售增长了22.5％（其中生产资料供应增长60％）。这已经是大跃进的速度了，但是，第二季度跃进的步伐更大、更快。今年第二季度比去年第二季度国内纯购进增长了172％（其中农副产品采购增长170％），国内纯销售增长82.7％（其中生产资料供应增长289.6％）。为什么第二季度的商品流转额增长得这么快呢？关键是，在各级党委领导下，在严重的抗旱斗争中，更加坚决而全面地贯彻了以农业为基础、以农业为中心的方针。
    在支援农业上应当明确的几个认识问题
    社会主义商业自建立之日起，就是为工农业生产、为消费者服务的。在这方面已经积累了丰富的经验。但是，就发展到技术改造新阶段的农业说，就以支援农业为中心说，我们还缺乏必要的经验。根据这一时期的实践，我们感到有这么几点需要提出来商榷。
    第一、商业支援农业，应当坚持通过商业本身的业务工作来进行。恩格斯说，商业促进生产是通过商业“本性所固有的规律进行的”。这里所指的商业“本性所固有的规律”，就是指“收购”、“销售”、“调运”、“储存”和“合理积累”而言。唐山市各县区商业部门在抗旱斗争中，出现了以下三种情况。第一种情况是，绝大部分商店，抽出一部分人参加抗旱劳动，一部分人继续坚持购销调存业务。他们的口号是“让路不下马，中心带其他，抗旱业务一把抓”。第二种情况是，有一部分商店，抽出大部分人参加抗旱劳动，留下一小部分人坚持生产资料供应；采购业务和生活资料供应基本停止。第三种情况是，有极少数商店购销业务全部停止，商业人员（除看门的外）全部参加抗旱劳动。结果怎么样呢？在第一种情况下，对抗旱贡献大，业务发展快，实现了支援农业与业务双丰收。在第二种特别是第三种情况下，有些排灌机械，因为缺乏零件或者找不到人修配，被闲置不用，不得不用大量人力担水点种，代替机器；个别地方或者因为调运不及时，或者因为门市部整月不开门，群众买些食盐、火柴都发生困难；有的地方，由于放松了收购工作，鲜蛋、鲜杏等商品率大为降低，不仅影响了出口和城市供应，也减少了社员收入和公共积累。显然，这种情况对生产是不利的。我们知道，国民经济有计划按比例发展，是不以人们的意志为转移的客观规律，在经济生活中任何一个组成部分的中断活动，对于整体都会发生程度不同的不良影响。由于农业生产季节性强，劳动力不足，在一定时期内，商业部门停止一部分可以缓办的业务，为中心工作让路，抽出一部分人投入农业生产，这是必要的。但是应当坚持“让路不下马，中心带其他，中心业务一齐抓。”特别是应季的生产资料和必需的生活用品，必须坚持供应，保证什么时候需要，什么时候供应。应季的农副产品也应当抓住季节，进行收购。经验证明，支援中心工作同业务工作是能够双丰收的，关键是要有一个很大的干劲。唐山市许多中心商店，抽出一半以上人员参加抗旱劳动，留下的人员，大部分在白天也参加劳动，结合劳动，地头汇货，登记购销，利用早晚休息时间，开门营业，送货下乡，串村收购，不仅从劳力到物资全面支援了农业，完成了购销计划，还密切了与群众的联系。
    第二，商业支援农业，应当坚持“全国一盘棋”的方针。商业是全民所有制经济，农业是集体所有制经济，两种经济成分基本上是统一的，但还存在着差别；凡是涉及全民利益、整体利益的事情，应当慎重处理，坚持“全国一盘棋”的方针。在这里，需要特别提出的是：商业在支援农业中，必须坚持遵守国家的统一收购政策，统一的市场管理与物价政策和经济核算制度。有的地区，为了解决农业电气化需要的材料，把国家规定统一收购的杂铜，不经过商业环节，而由公社自筹自用。有的生产队把国家统一收购的物资，与工业部门以货易货，有的高价出售，而一些商业工作人员却袖手旁观，甚至牵线挂钩，视为对农业的支援，这些做法是不正确的。说到经济核算制度，商业部门作为全民所有制的一个独立的经济部门，应当坚持经济核算，应当有合理的积累。但是，在个别情况下，由于支援生产的迫切需要，赔一些钱，也是允许的。有些同志，对于这种个别与一般分不清楚，认为支援农业就可以赔钱，甚至认为计算盈亏，就是算小账，不算大账，生产观点不强。这种认识，当然是不全面的。商业对国家担负着合理积累的任务，商业的利润上缴国家，加速建设，对农业也是有利的。相反，如果商业赔钱太多，会影响国家财政预算的执行，对整个建设是不利的。
    第三，商业支援农业，必须注意减少经营环节，合理组织商品流转，把扩展商品流通同合理安排经营环节密切结合起来。商品流通的扩展是生产发展的结果，又能促进生产的进一步发展。但是，并不是所有的商业经营都能促进生产。有两种情况，一种是出于生产发展的需要，一种是纯粹增加商业经营环节的结果。一般说来，后一种情况对于经济活动，对于生产是有损无益的。有些农副产品，在人民公社内部进行调剂，可以不经过商业环节的，就不必强调由商业收购分配；有些副业生产，可以采取加工形式的就不必采取出售原料、收购成品的形式；有些购销业务，通过组织工作能够解决问题的，就不必强调加以经营。增加一道经营环节，就会增加一系列商品流通费用。马克思说过，“一切只起因于不是商品形态变化的流通费用，都不会把价值加到产品中去，这是一般的法则”。马克思并进一步指出，在资本主义社会“投在这种费用上的资本，是资本主义生产的虚费。”在我们这里，已经有完全取消这种“虚费”的物质基础，应当有计划地审慎地安排商品流转环节，把过去因袭下来的不合理的经营环节，坚决取消，更不应当为追求经营额而人为地增加经营环节。但是，如果商业经营以后，有利于生产发展，有利于满足群众需要，有利于贯彻“全国一盘棋”方针和加强商品流转计划性的，必须主动地、积极地加以经营，使商业工作更好地为政治、为生产、为群众服务。
