　　I, Jiang Xiuzhen, a member of the Mayashi People's Commune in Guichi, Anhui, feel that we, the working people, can stand up and become cultured entirely due to the good leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Recalling how I, a poor peasant's simple girl, used to herd cattle and collect firewood, suffering under the oppression of the landlords, not even knowing how to read the simplest characters, I have now become the deputy director of the commune's orchard, the propaganda member of the Communist Youth League's general branch directly under the commune, and the head of the cultural troupe.

　　I have loved singing since I was a child, learning mountain songs and ditties from the elderly. Every time I went up the mountain to collect firewood, I would always sing. The landlords and rich young masters would mock me:
　　"Don't be happy for nothing. How much food and drink will your singing get you?" Let them laugh; I still sang my songs. At that time, my father was a poor peasant who had served as the deputy village chief of the New Fourth Army. He often explained things to me. Only then did I slowly understand that only the New Fourth Army and the Communist Party could save us poor people. When herding cattle and collecting firewood, with hatred in my heart, I would sing mountain songs:

　　No fields and no land at home,
　　Suffering from hunger all year round,
　　The day will come when we see the clear sky,
　　Take off our ragged clothes and put on new ones.

　　That day finally arrived. The Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army brought the clear sky, and we saw the sun. From then on, under the Party's nurturing, I participated in various tasks, engaged in propaganda, and learned culture. The district head saw that I loved to sing and asked me to be the mountain song captain of the Chuanfeng Team. Secretary Luo said to me, "The mountain song team must publicize the Party's policies, encourage everyone's production enthusiasm, and work hard in the future." I remembered the Party's words. Under the leadership of the Party, our mountain song team has been combining production and political movements, writing and singing our own songs, and engaging in cultural activities to promote the Party's central work.

　　In 1958, the Party's General Line released boundless radiance. The Great Leap Forward in our area was in full swing, everyone was full of energy and enthusiasm, and life became happier and happier. Therefore, when the People's Commune was established, the people of the whole township decorated with lanterns and colored hangings, everyone was beaming with joy. At the celebration meeting, I went on stage and composed a song:

　　The People's Commune is a flower,
　　Loved by men, women, old and young,
　　Everyone says the same thing when they meet,
　　Praising the commune at every turn.

　　This mountain song expressed what everyone had in mind, and it quickly spread, and everyone could sing it. At that time, the cultural revolution movement was being carried out, with large-scale compilation of folk songs and large-scale literary and artistic creation. Everyone was very enthusiastic, and the mass literary and artistic creation movement in the entire commune quickly developed.

　　Immediately following the autumn harvest and the large-scale steel production, the commune launched a vigorous water conservancy construction movement. At the construction site, our mountain song team encouraged everyone while working.

　　The effectiveness of water management increased day by day, and the labor chants became louder and louder, audible for miles. It didn't seem like a construction site but like a thousand-person chorus, singing so that everyone felt like they had wind at their heels when carrying earth. We felt even happier, and the mountain songs became more and more numerous and more and more energetic as we sang.

　　Under the influence of the mountain song team, everyone loved to compose and sing songs, often competing in song contests. Once a contest started, the singing would fill the mountains and slopes. Last year, when we were transplanting rice seedlings, our fertilizer transport team ran into the Aicun transplanting team. I started the song:

　　"If you don't sing when you're young, what are you saving your energy for? Let's sing mountain songs together, don't let the mountain song stage go cold." Liu Baishou of the Aicun transplanting team replied: "Once you start singing mountain songs, it's hard to stop, once you start competing, don't think about leaving." Then he started singing a mountain song, and I immediately joined in.

　　Everyone sang in harmony, and the mountain songs flowed like the endless Yangtze River. In the blink of an eye, the seedlings were transplanted, and everyone felt light and easy while working.

　　Last year, just as the rice in our entire commune was flowering and heading, we encountered a drought. Everyone devoted themselves to the drought resistance struggle, fighting for grain with the heavens. Under the leadership of the Party branch, our mountain song team became active again at the drought resistance construction site. The singing helped everyone boost their spirits, the work efficiency was high, and it wasn't tiring. The people operating the waterwheels changed shifts after burning a stick of incense. When everyone was excited, the incense had burned out for a long time, and they forgot to change shifts.

　　After a hard struggle, we won a bumper harvest. In September, the late rice in the Chuanfeng Brigade was golden yellow. Seeing this good harvest, we couldn't help but sing while harvesting:

　　A gust of autumn wind turns a slope yellow,
　　The late rice is even better than the early rice,
　　The early rice yields a thousand catties per mu,
　　The late rice harvest doubles.

　　The blue sky is high and the green water is long,
　　Golden ears of grain cover the slope.
　　Thanks to our benefactor Chairman Mao,
　　Chuanfeng has become a land of rice.

　　Under the leadership of the Party, our mountain song team has become a propaganda and mobilization team, learning from and imitating the willows, composing and singing new people and new things, and singing with everyone. In the past two years, the Chuanfeng Brigade has composed more than 10,000 mountain songs, published six collections of folk songs, and cultivated more than 120 folk singers. We also often learn songs from the elderly. Grandpa Yang, who is over seventy years old in Yangcun, has many mountain songs and ditties in his head. On rainy and snowy days, I always go to his house and learn them over and over again. I also participated in drama and dance activities, singing new songs and performing new plays. The Party often cultivates me, asks us about the central work, assigns tasks, and sends me to attend performances at the county, district, and provincial levels, where I have learned many new folk songs and new dances.

　　I once assured the Party that I would be a skilled worker in production, a clever girl, and a vanguard in literature and art, singing loudly about the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, praising the great benefactor, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and striving to go to Beijing to report to our beloved Chairman Mao. Today, my wish has come true. Our dear leader Chairman Mao received us. He was radiant and waved to us kindly. I was extremely happy and excited. I wanted to say, I have many songs to sing, but I couldn't sing them. I just shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" My palms turned red, and I didn't know where the energy came from. After returning, the song came to my heart, and I opened my mouth and sang:

　　Today makes me happy,
　　Songs well up in my heart,
　　Great leader Chairman Mao,
　　A kind smile greets us.

　　Applause and cheers filled the clouds,
　　Chairman Mao's face glowed red,
　　This is a blessing for the people of the whole country,
　　Chairman Mao is in good health.

### 山歌越唱越有劲

    山歌越唱越有劲
    安徽贵池马牙人民公社社员　姜秀珍
    我们劳动人民能够翻身，能够有文化，全是党和毛主席的好领导。回想我这个贫农的呆丫头，从小放牛打柴，受地主的压迫，扁担大一字也认不得，现在却当上了公社园艺场副场长、共青团公社直属机关总支宣传委员、文工团团长。
    我从小喜欢唱歌，跟老年人学唱山歌小调。每次上山打柴，老是唱不离口，地主阔少爷却嘲笑我：
  “别穷快活，你唱到多少吃的？多少喝的？”他笑他的，我还是唱我的。那时我父亲是个贫农，曾当过新四军的副村长，常讲些道理给我听。我那时才慢慢懂得只有新四军、共产党才能救我们穷人。放牛打柴时，心里有恨，我就唱山歌：
    家中无田又无地，
    一年四季熬着饥，
    有朝一日见青天，
    脱掉破袄换新衣。
    这个日子终于盼到了。共产党、人民解放军带来了青天，我们见到了太阳。从这以后，在党的培养下，我参加了各项工作，搞宣传，学文化。区长看我爱唱，要我当船峰队山歌队长。罗书记对我说：“山歌队要宣传党的政策，鼓舞大家的生产情绪，往后更要好好地干。”党的话我记住了。我们这个山歌队，在党的领导下，就一直结合生产和政治运动，自编自唱，搞文艺活动，宣传党的中心工作。
    1958年，党的总路线放出万丈光芒，我们那里生产大跃进热火朝天，人人干劲冲天，兴高采烈，日子越过越快活。所以人民公社成立的时候，全乡人民张灯结彩，人人喜气洋洋，在庆祝会上，我上台编了一首歌：
    人民公社一支花，
    男女老少都爱它，
    大家见面无二话，
    开口就把公社夸。
    这首山歌唱出了大家心里的话，很快就唱开了，人人都会唱。那时候，正开展文化革命运动，大编民歌，大搞文艺创作，大家劲头很大，全公社群众文艺创作运动，很快就开展起来了。
    紧接着秋收、大办钢铁，公社开展了轰轰烈烈的兴修水利运动。在工地上，我们山歌队一边劳动，一边给大家鼓劲。
    治水工效一天比一天高，劳动号子一声比一声响，几里路外都听得见，哪里像是工地，就像千人大合唱，唱得人人推起土来脚下生风。我们心里也更快活，山歌越编越多，越唱越有劲。
    在山歌队的影响下，大家都爱编歌唱歌，常常在一起赛歌，一赛起来就唱得满山满坡都是歌声。去年插秧的时候，我们运肥队和艾村插秧队碰上了，我把歌头子引起来：
  “年纪轻轻不唱歌，留着力气干什么？要唱山歌我俩来，莫把山歌唱冷台。”艾村插秧队刘百寿接起来：“唱起山歌口难收，对上山歌莫想走”，接着他唱起山歌来，我也马上合上去。
    大家一唱一和，山歌唱起来就像长江水不断头，眨眼就把秧插完了，大家干活都感到轻快。
    去年我们全社稻子刚刚扬花抽穗，就碰到干旱，人人投入了抗旱斗争，与天争粮。我们山歌队在党支部的领导下，在抗旱工地上又活跃起来。歌声帮大家提精神，工效高，又不累。车水的人是点一根香换一次班。大家听到兴头上，香点完了好久，忘记了换班。
    大家经过苦战，夺取了大丰收。9月间，船峰大队的晚稻一片金黄，看到这个好年成，我们一面抢收，一面情不自禁地唱起来：
    一阵秋风一坂黄，
    晚稻又比早稻强，
    早稻亩产一千斤，
    晚稻收成翻一番。
    蓝天高来绿水长，
    满坂谷穗金晃晃。
    感谢恩人毛主席，
    船峰变成米粮川。
    我们这个山歌队在党的领导下，就是这样地成为一支宣传鼓动队，望风采柳，把新人新事编出来唱出来，还和大家一起唱。两年多来，船峰大队编了一万多首山歌，出了六本民歌集，培养民歌手一百二十多个。我们还经常向老年人学歌。杨村有一个七十多岁的杨老爷爷，肚子里山歌小调很多。雨雪天总上他家去，一遍又一遍地学。我还参加了戏剧歌舞活动，唱新歌，演新戏。党经常培养我，布置中心工作都找我们，交代任务，还派我出席县、专区和省的会演，更学习了很多新民歌、新歌舞。
    我曾经向党保证，一定在生产上当能手，做巧姑娘，在文艺上当尖兵，放开喉咙，高唱总路线、大跃进、人民公社，歌颂伟大的恩人共产党和毛主席，争取上北京，向亲爱的毛主席汇报。今天，我这个愿望实现了。亲爱的领袖毛主席接见了我们。他老人家满面红光，亲切地向我们招手。我幸福极了，激动极了，我要说，我也有好多歌要唱，想唱又唱不出来，我直喊“毛主席万岁！”我两个手掌拍红了，那股劲不知从那里来的。回来以后，歌上心来，我张口就唱起来：
    今天叫我喜开怀，
    心里歌儿涌出来，
    伟大领袖毛主席，
    慈爱微笑迎面来。
    全场掌声呼声穿云朵，
    毛主席满面放红光，
    这是全国人民好福气，
    毛主席身体真健康。
