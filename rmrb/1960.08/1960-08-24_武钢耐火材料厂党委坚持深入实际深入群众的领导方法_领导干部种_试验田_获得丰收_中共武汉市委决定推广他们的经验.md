    Wuhan, August 23 (reported by this newspaper) The leading cadres of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Refractory Materials Plant, headed by Party Committee Secretary Zhao Ke, have persisted in going deep into the workshops and working alongside workers to plant "experimental plots" since the second quarter of this year, achieving significant results. By planting "experimental plots," they gathered the wisdom of the workers and masses, and by planting "experimental plots," they persisted in it. This not only solved the key problem of low product quality, achieving high quality and high output, but also improved the ideological awareness of the workers and masses and the management level of the enterprise. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to the experience of Zhao Ke and others in planting "experimental plots" and has decided to promote it throughout the city.

    Since the plant was put into production last year, a prominent problem has been low product quality, with a finished product rate of only about 40%. Some technical cadres and technicians, based on production reports, test results, and technical theoretical analysis, believed that the poor quality was due to poor raw materials and incomplete drying equipment, and that it was difficult to solve the problem through subjective efforts. Zhao Ke, the Party Committee Secretary who had just arrived at the plant, discovered this problem and organized several forums for cadres and technical personnel, but the problem was not solved. These facts enlightened him, making him deeply aware that without going deep into production in a down-to-earth manner, personally practicing, and fully mobilizing and relying on the masses, it would not be possible to change the face of production. He submitted his opinions to the Party Committee. After discussion, the Party Committee made a decision for leading cadres to go deep into the front line of production, cultivate "experimental plots" on a large scale, and vigorously tackle the key to quality.

    Zhao Ke took the lead in implementing the Party Committee's resolution, first going to the clay high-alumina workshop to experiment with sleeve bricks, which had the highest scrap rate. Sleeve bricks are a type of brick used in open-hearth furnaces that look like vases, with a large bottom and a small top. The "neck" of the small opening is prone to cracking, forming defective products. Zhao Ke participated in labor in the eight main processes from raw material crushing to oven brick removal, and studied the working conditions of each process with the workers to find out that the reason for the cracking of the "neck" of the sleeve brick was the improper proportion of ingredients, abnormal furnace temperature, and poor kiln loading method, which caused the small opening to bear excessive pressure and produce cracks; the most important of which was the poor kiln loading method. He then held a "three-way combination" meeting to formulate four kiln loading schemes for testing. During the experiment, Zhao Ke participated in the labor of each process, inspecting while working, supporting workers' innovative suggestions, and studying and improving the kiln loading method; after the bricks were removed from the kiln, he personally inspected them to analyze the reasons for the good and bad quality. The first three kiln loading methods failed. Zhao Ke encouraged everyone to continue analyzing the reasons and boldly experimenting. Later, a kiln loading method of racking sleeve bricks to protect the neck from pressure was adopted, and twenty-two bricks were fired, eliminating all neck cracks; however, a number of new problems were discovered, such as gray arches, central cracks, and cavities in the brick body. Zhao Ke again summoned all the technical cadres, technicians, and workers to a field meeting that night to study countermeasures. Faced with these problems, a new ideological struggle unfolded. One engineer said, "The central cracks are due to excessive moisture in the raw materials." Some technical cadres agreed with his opinion; however, many veteran workers and technical cadres believed, based on years of production experience, that if the raw materials were bad, the brick body would inevitably crack from the inside to the outside, and if the forming worker operated carelessly, it would only crack on the surface. Zhao Ke said, "Okay, let the facts speak for themselves!" He immediately broke two bricks, both of which had surface cracks. The opponents were still not convinced. Zhao Ke went with them to the forming section for on-site inspection, and after opening several more bricks, they were all surface cracks, which unified the understanding. The "three-way combination" meeting also found the reasons for the generation of gray arches and cavities. Early the next morning, he held a small exhibition on the kiln platform, put the key problems on display, and mobilized everyone to come up with solutions. At this time, the news of the Party Committee Secretary planting "experimental plots" had spread throughout the plant. Some workshop cadres said: In the past, we always felt that there were a lot of problems and we didn't know where to start, but now we have a way. Therefore, the cadres worked in three shifts, and their luggage was also moved to the workshop and in front of the kiln. "Three-way combination" groups with Party branches and Party groups as the core were established from the workshop to the work section; the workers also actively participated in the activities of planting "experimental plots." Large-scale planting of "experimental plots" to strive for high quality and high output quickly became a mass movement throughout the plant. After experimentation, improvement, re-experimentation, and re-improvement, the finished product rate of sleeve bricks rose rapidly, breaking the prescribed target of 93% or more in less than six days.

    Leading cadres persisting in planting "experimental plots" not only quickly and effectively solved some production problems, but also inspired the enthusiasm of the workers, liberated people's minds, and promoted the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The leading cadres also promptly analyzed and evaluated the creations in the "experimental plots," summarized them into some relatively complete advanced experiences, and incorporated them into process regulations and management systems. For example, in the process of planting "experimental plots," the cadres of the dolomite workshop summarized the creations of the masses into a set of new technologies of "high wind and high temperature, more loading, fast burning and fast removal, and uniform mixing and distribution," which increased the daily output of dolomite from 34 tons to 69.12 tons. The plant created many new production quotas, and the utilization rate and production capacity of most equipment were doubled.

    The Party Committee's leading cadres taking the lead in planting "experimental plots" promoted the further improvement of leadership style and working methods by all cadres in the plant. Now, it has become a common practice for cadres at all levels to go deep into the front line of production and solve problems in a down-to-earth manner. Wherever the key is, they go to plant "experimental plots"; they not only plant "experimental plots" in production, but also plant "experimental plots" in terms of living problems. A situation of comprehensive leap forward in all aspects of work has emerged in the plant.

    武钢耐火材料厂党委坚持深入实际深入群众的领导方法
    领导干部种“试验田”获得丰收
    中共武汉市委决定推广他们的经验
    本报武汉23日电　武钢耐火材料厂以党委书记赵克为首的领导干部，今年第二季度以来坚持深入车间和工人一道种“试验田”，取得了重大的成果。他们通过种“试验田”把职工群众的智慧集中起来，又通过种“试验田”把它坚持下去，不仅解决了产品质量不高的关键问题，作到了优质高产，而且提高了职工群众的思想觉悟和企业的管理水平。中共武汉市委很重视赵克等种“试验田”的经验，已经决定在全市推广。
    这个厂从去年投入生产以来，存在的一个突出的问题是产品质量不高，成品率只有40％左右。一些技术干部和技术人员根据生产表报、化验结果和技术理论分析，认为质量不好的原因是原料不好、干燥设备不全等，靠主观努力很难解决问题。到厂不久的党委书记赵克发现这个问题后，几次组织干部和技术人员务虚，也没有解决问题。这些事实启发了他，使他深切地认识到，不扎扎实实地深入到生产中去，亲自实践，不充分发动和依靠群众，是不能改变生产面貌的。他把自己的意见提交党委会。经过讨论，党委作出了领导干部深入生产第一线，大种“试验田”，猛攻质量关键的决定。
    赵克带头执行党委决议，首先下到粘土高铝车间，抓住报废最多的袖砖作试验。袖砖是平炉用的像花瓶样子的一种砖，下大上小，小口的脖子容易裂纹，形成废品。赵克就在从原料粉碎到烘炉出砖的八个主要工序参加劳动，和工人一起研究每个工序的工作情况，找出袖砖“脖子”裂纹的原因是配料比不恰当，炉温不正常和装窑方法不好，使小口承受压力过大产生裂纹；其中最主要的是装窑方法不好。他便召开“三结合”会议，制订了四种装窑方案进行试验。试验过程中，赵克先后参加了每个工序的劳动，边劳动边检查，支持工人的革新建议，研究改进装窑方法；砖出窑以后，他便亲手检验，分析质量好坏的原因。前三种装砖方法都失败了，赵克鼓励大家，继续分析原因，大胆试验。后来采取架装袖砖，保护脖子不受压力的装窑方法，烧出二十二块砖，脖子裂纹全部消灭了；但又发现了不少袖砖的砖身产生灰拱，中间裂纹和有熔洞等三个新问题。赵克又连夜召集全厂技术干部，技术人员和工人开现场会，研究对策。面对这些问题，一场新的思想斗争又展开了。一个工程师说：“中间裂纹是原料水分过大”。一部分技术干部同意他的意见；但是不少老工人和技术干部根据多年的生产经验，认为：如果是原料不好，砖身必然从内到外一裂到底，如果是成型工操作不慎，只会表面发裂。赵克说：“好，让事实说话！”当场打破两块，都是表面裂纹。反对者还不服气。赵克便和他们一道到成型工段实地察看，又一连打开几块，也都是表面发裂，这才把认识统一了。“三结合”会议还找出了产生灰拱和熔洞的原因。第二天一早，他又在窑台上举办小型展览会，把关键问题摆出来，发动大家想办法。这时候，党委书记种“试验田”的消息已经传遍全厂。有些车间干部说：过去我们总是感觉问题一大堆，不知从何着手，这下可有门路了。于是，干部们分三班跟班劳动，行李也搬到车间、窑前。从车间到工段都建立了以党支部和党小组为核心的“三结合”小组；工人也都积极参加种“试验田”的活动。大种“试验田”，争取优质高产，很快成了全厂群众性的运动。经过试验，改进，再试验，再改进，袖砖成品率迅速上升，不到六天就突破了规定的目标——93％以上。
    领导干部坚持种“试验田”，不仅迅速切实地解决了一些生产上的问题，而且鼓舞了职工的干劲，解放了人们的思想，推动了技术革新和技术革命运动。领导干部还及时把“试验田”里的创造，经过分析鉴定，总结成一些比较完整的先进经验，并纳入了工艺规程和管理制度。如白云石车间的干部在种“试验田”过程中，把群众的创造总结成为“大风高温多装，快烧快出，混合均匀布料”的一套新技术，使白云石日产量由三十四吨提高到六十九点一二吨。全厂创造了许多生产新定额，大部分设备利用率和生产能力都提高了一倍。
    党委领导干部带头种“试验田”，推动了全厂干部进一步改进领导作风和工作方法。现在，各级干部深入生产第一线切切实实解决问题，已经形成风气。哪里是关键，就到哪里种“试验田”；不仅在生产上种“试验田”，而且在生活问题方面也种“试验田”。全厂出现了各项工作全面跃进的局面。
