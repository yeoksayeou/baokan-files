Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 21st - "Hoy," the Cuban newspaper, published today the full text of the general report on the work of the party delivered by Blas Roca, General Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, at the party's Eighth National Congress on the 16th. In his report, he summarized in detail the work and struggles carried out since the last National Congress.

Roca pointed out, "Armed struggle is the decisive way for the Cuban people to defeat tyrannical rule and achieve revolutionary victory. Experience has proven that under our country's conditions, it is possible to organize armed struggles of guerrillas combining urban and rural struggles, develop the guerrillas into a rebel army, and defeat the armed forces of the dictatorial regime provided with bombs, planes, tanks, and artillery by the United States." He emphasized the great significance of the people's unity in achieving victory and defending the revolution. He said, "The goal of the struggle to win class unity remains: to consolidate the unity of the working class, establish an alliance between workers and peasants, and an alliance with the urban petty bourgeoisie, as the basic force for revolutionary development in the current period, and to attract to our side those strata within the national bourgeoisie who are prepared to resolutely oppose imperialism." He emphasized, "Always facing the masses, always being with the masses, this has been and remains the basic principle of our activities."

In discussing the five main characteristics of the Cuban Revolution, he said that the first and most prominent is that the struggle of the rebel army is the main and prominent means of overthrowing the pro-imperialist tyranny. He said, "The second obvious characteristic of the Cuban Revolution is that it is not limited to replacing some figures in power, parties, and social forces, nor is it limited to seizing the state machinery, but it destroys the entire ruling machine of tyrannical rule." "The third characteristic is that the revolution drives some classes out of power and puts other classes in power, destroys the semi-colonial and latifundist regime, and begins to establish a revolutionary regime of national liberation, land reform, and social progress." He also said, "The fourth characteristic is that the Cuban Revolution not only overthrew tyrannical rule, but also overthrew the political rule of US imperialism over Cuba through the US authorities and the Cuban rulers, politicians, and leaders who were obedient to it." He said that international support is of great significance to the Cuban Revolution, which is the fifth characteristic of the Cuban Revolution.

Roca emphasized, "The victory and development of the Cuban Revolution in the face of US imperialism shattered all the arguments of fatalism, theories that attempted to make people believe that the countries of Latin America are geographically close to the United States, are small countries with weak military power, and economically depend on the United States, so they must always submit to the United States, must seek to improve their situation within the scope of subordination to imperialism rather than opposing imperialism, must submit to the United States' evil war policy and not oppose it, and must curry favor with the imperialists rather than oppose and fight them."

Roca said that now, "The Cuban Revolution is not a communist revolution; it is an anti-imperialist and anti-latifundist revolution. In terms of the historical tasks it faces and is fulfilling, it can be considered a national liberation and land revolution, a patriotic and democratic revolution. In terms of the class forces that persist in and promote it and the radical methods it adopts, it can be considered an advanced people's revolution."

Roca condemned imperialism and its running dogs for engaging in anti-communism. He pointed out that anti-communism is a weapon used by imperialism and its running dogs to oppose the revolution and the just aspirations of the people, "Anyone who falls into the trap of anti-communism is consciously or unconsciously serving the counter-revolutionary, oppressive, and exploitative purposes embraced by the US imperialists, the latifundists, and their docile running dogs."

Roca listed the historical tasks facing the revolution and which it is realizing, including: restoring and exercising national sovereignty, eliminating the latifundist system, abolishing the concessions that burden Cuba, granting heavy rights to companies and individuals, implementing national industrialization, realizing true and broadest democracy for the people, implementing and developing an independent foreign policy, strengthening the rebel army, worker-peasant militias, and security agencies, consolidating and developing the revolutionary state, and so on.

Roca pointed out, "This government represents and implements the policies of an informal and unwritten alliance of the proletariat, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and the progressive strata of the national bourgeoisie," "In terms of its composition, it is mainly an alliance of the petty bourgeoisie, peasants, and the proletariat." Roca pointed out, "The revolutionary regime is not a temporary regime, although it does not yet have a definite form and political system. The revolutionary regime was established to carry the revolution through to the end."

Roca refuted the imperialist attacks on Cuba for not holding elections, saying, "The people understand that the basic problems of the revolution should be resolved first, and then elections should be held." Roca pointed out, "Cuba has already held elections of blood and struggle. Cuba voted with blood and struggle against tyranny, and defeated tyranny."

Roca said, "The number one enemy, the US imperialists, has become the gendarme of international reaction, the friend of all reactionary and regressive forces in the world, and the enemy of all progressive, democratic, people's, and revolutionary movements, as well as socialist and communist movements, no matter where these movements arise and develop." He also said that within Cuba, "The latifundists, big merchants, importers, the wealthy, and the exploiters, bureaucratic capitalists, and monopolistic oligarchs connected with imperialism and the latifundist system, who were formed under the support and assistance of the dictatorial regime, are the main social groups who completely and stubbornly oppose the Cuban Revolution."

In discussing the forces and friends of the Cuban Revolution, Roca said, "The main social forces of the Cuban Revolution are the working class, the peasantry, and the urban petty bourgeoisie, who together constitute the Cuban people, the poor masses." He said, "The bourgeoisie, which benefits from the revolution, supports the revolution, but is often afraid of the radical measures taken by the revolution, the threats, intimidation, and attacks of US imperialism, and is suspicious and wavering because of its fear of the future." He said, "The working class is the class that directly makes the greatest contribution to the revolution, and is the first class to make the necessary sacrifices and take the necessary actions for the victory and advancement of the revolution." "The working class stands at the forefront of all classes and strata in the task of defending and advancing the revolution."

Roca said that the Cuban Revolution "not only has strong internal forces, but also has the active support and deep friendship of the people of Latin American countries, Asian and African countries, socialist countries, workers, peace advocates, progressives, and people of all countries in the world." He pointed out, "Any progress made by any country in Latin America in striving for national sovereignty and establishing a revolutionary government that resolutely opposes US imperialism undoubtedly means the greatest assistance to Cuba." He emphasized, "The automatic and generous assistance provided by socialist countries is of decisive significance to the Cuban Revolution. This assistance is carried out in accordance with the Marxist-Leninist proletarian internationalist principles guiding their policies and the principle of assisting countries struggling against imperialism and for freedom and independence." He said that the Cuban people are grateful for the support given by the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, as well as the people of the world.

In discussing the international situation, Roca pointed out, "The rise of socialism contrasts sharply with the crisis and decline of imperialism. The rule of imperialism over many countries has been in crisis." "Throughout Latin America, the movement and struggle resolutely opposing imperialism are constantly rising. Mass actions in support of Cuba are a powerful proof of opposition to imperialism." Roca emphasized, "US imperialists continue to pursue a policy of war, which maintains and intensifies international tensions and undermines international efforts to achieve agreements to ban atomic weapons and the means of delivering these weapons, and to achieve supervised disarmament." "The United States colludes with Chiang Kai-shek, the fleeing Batista of Asia, illegally occupies China's Taiwan Island, is in a state of potential war against the People's Republic of China, and uses the Seventh Fleet to occupy the territorial waters of the People's Republic of China." "The United States continues to pursue its war policy, filling the world with military bases from Japan in the Far East to Spain at the cutting edge of Europe."

In discussing the US naval base at Guantanamo in Cuba, Roca emphasized that it is not only a constant threat to Cuba, but also a center for provocation against Latin American countries along the Atlantic coast. He said, "For the sake of peace, the security of the people of all countries, and the sovereignty and independence of all countries, these US military bases spread throughout the world and established in Latin America should be abolished." "The current international situation is: the forces of socialism, national liberation movements, and peace-keeping movements that jointly oppose imperialist aggression are stronger and more powerful than imperialism, colonialism, and forces keen to intensify international tensions and war." Roca said, "We know that the forces of the socialist camp, independent countries, and peace advocates around the world, relying on constant efforts and continued vigilance, can restrain the hands of imperialist war-mongers; avoid the danger of war, maintain peace, and establish peaceful coexistence."

In discussing the situation in Cuba, Roca said that as long as the armed forces and the people united to wage a true people's war are prepared, coupled with international support, it is possible to prevent US military intervention, or defeat it if military intervention occurs.

In discussing reactionary activities, Roca pointed out, "Recently, Titoist views have also appeared here. These elements who try to compromise with imperialism, stop the revolution, and lead the revolution to failure, regard Yugoslavia as a model for them to learn from. They pretend to be revolutionaries, but promote counter-revolutionary views. They are terrified spies, but they do not run away, but spread cowardice, spread fear and confusion. It is no accident that counter-revolutionary traitors try their best to promote the works of Djilas and other Yugoslav revisionists; it is also no accident that right-wing elements and reactionaries try to portray Yugoslavia as very supportive of the Cuban Revolution, although in reality its assistance is negligible. The United States will never allow it to do more."

In his report, Roca talked about Cuba's land reform, the struggle to regain national sovereignty, and the economic situation. He said, "In fact, the semi-feudal latifundist system no longer exists in Cuba." "While implementing land reform, agricultural production is increasing and diversifying." Roca said that in the development of land reform, peasant associations are gradually developing into organizational forms for peasants, and the leaders of peasant associations are poor and middle peasants. Roca emphasized, "The principle that peasants should only join cooperatives through persuasion and only voluntarily should be strictly observed." Roca pointed out that nationalizing US enterprises "is a fatal blow to imperialism's economic rule in Cuba. This is a decisive step in striving for economic independence, and is the main foundation and guarantee of political independence."

Roca talked about Cuba's economic relations with socialist countries and their importance to Cuba's economic development. He said, "The economic and trade relations established between Cuba and socialist countries have enabled Cuba to resist all the pressures from the United States, shattering the United States' economic aggression and its sinister conspiracies and destruction of the (Cuban) national economy." "We do not yet have diplomatic relations with some socialist countries, such as the People's Republic of China, the German Democratic Republic, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We hope that the obstacles left over from the old regime that hinder the establishment of such relations will be eliminated. Chiang Kai-shek's representatives have nothing to do in our country. They do not represent China, but only represent a shameless tyrant, a foreign lackey like Batista. The representative in Cuba should be the representative of China, which has friendly relations with us."

Roca then talked about the issue of defending and advancing the Cuban Revolution. He said, "Defending the revolution and advancing the revolution is the central task, and this is not outdated." "The United States has not given up now, and will not give up attacking the Cuban Revolution in the future. If one attack fails, another attack will begin. If one road does not work, another road will be found. War criminals, thieves, spies, and former latifundists who fled to the United States and are still operating in our territory will never give up attacking the Cuban Revolution." Roca said that the main tool used by US imperialists to obtain the cooperation of Latin American countries and other allied governments to attack the revolution is the Organization of American States, which "is a colonial department of the United States, and its hypocritical excuse is the fabricated Soviet intervention and the equally fabricated absurd statement of the 'threat of international communism,' which they used the same excuse to find an excuse for the heinous crimes they committed against Guatemala."

Roca emphasized, "Defending the revolution and advancing the revolution requires being prepared to resist and defeat any armed attack launched against Cuba by any force, no matter what flag they are waving, whether it is the Organization of American States, the United States, any of its satellite governments, or the counter-revolution."

Regarding the party, Roca pointed out, "The revolution cannot be entrusted to natural development and the spontaneity of the masses. The mobilized masses are undoubtedly the decisive force in history. However, if these masses do not have the leadership of an organized force based on Marxist revolutionary thought and a revolutionary program, they may waste and consume their strength without value, taking anarchistic and scattered actions. Great figures who are supported by the masses, and who can listen to the opinions of the masses, be united with the masses, and correctly guide the masses forward, with the qualities of leaders, can play a major role when they work according to historical needs and revolutionary demands. However, they cannot replace the necessity of being organized, but make this need more urgent. Only a revolutionary organization can stabilize and continue revolutionary activities regardless of how turbulent the situation is, and can coordinate the daily actions of the millions of people who make up the people." Roca said, "Our party is one of the organized forces of the Cuban Revolution." He pointed out that all these organized forces are today under the leadership of revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, maintaining close coordination and cooperative unity of action. "We believe that due to the development of the revolution, and due to the progress made in the increasingly close coordination and cooperation of revolutionary forces, at the appropriate moment, complete unity can and should be achieved, that is, all forces are united into a unified movement."

Roca finally pointed out that it is necessary to greatly strengthen and improve the party's ideological work and improve the Marxist-Leninist ideological level of party members and all loyal and firm revolutionaries. He said that at the same time, it is necessary to maintain the purity of the party's ranks and purge opportunists, those who create chaos, any revisionists, or bad elements.

    古巴人民社会党总书记罗加向全国代表大会作总报告
    古巴人民的中心任务是保卫和推进革命
    武装斗争是古巴革命主要手段　古巴的胜利粉碎了拉丁美洲必须屈从美国的宿命论
    美帝国主义决不会放弃对古巴革命的进攻　侵略者不论打出什么旗号一定要被击退
    新华社哈瓦那21日电　古巴“今日报”今天发表了古巴人民社会党总书记布拉斯·罗加16日在党的第八次全国代表大会上所作的关于党的工作的总报告的全文，他在报告中详尽地总结了从上次代表大会到现在所进行的工作和斗争。
    罗加指出，“武装斗争是古巴人民击败暴政统治和取得革命胜利的有决定意义的方式。经验证明，在我国的条件下，有可能组织与城乡斗争相结合的游击队的武装斗争，把游击队发展成为起义军，并击败由美国提供炸弹、飞机、坦克和大炮的独裁政权的武装部队。”他强调指出了人民团结在取得胜利和保卫革命中的重大意义。他说，“争取阶级团结的斗争目标仍然是：巩固地团结工人阶级，建立工农联盟以及同城市小资产阶级的联盟，以此作为目前时期革命发展的基本力量，把民族资产阶级内部准备坚决反对帝国主义的阶层吸引到自己方面来。”他强调指出，“永远面向群众，永远同群众在一起，这一点过去是，现在仍然是我们活动的基本方针。”
    他在谈到古巴革命的五个主要特点时说，首先和最突出的是，起义军的斗争是推翻亲帝国主义暴政的主要和突出的手段。他说：“古巴革命的第二个明显的特点是：它不限于更换一些掌权的人物、政党和社会势力，不限于夺取政权机器，而且摧毁暴政统治的全部统治机器”。“第三个特点是，革命把一些阶级逐出政权而由另外一些阶级掌握政权，摧毁了半殖民地和大庄园的政权，并开始建立了民族解放、土地改革和社会进步的革命政权。”他又说：“第四个特点是，古巴革命不仅推翻了暴政统治，而且推翻了美帝国主义通过美国当局和对它唯命是听的古巴执政者、政客和领导人对古巴进行的政治统治。”他说，国际支援对古巴革命具有非常重大的意义，这是古巴革命的第五个特点。
    罗加强调指出：“古巴革命面对美帝国主义所取得的胜利和发展粉碎了宿命论的一切论点，这些理论企图使人相信，拉丁美洲各国地理上同美国相距很近，是军事力量薄弱的小国，并且在经济上依靠美国，因此它们必须永远屈从美国，必须在从属于帝国主义的范围内、而不是在反对帝国主义者的情况下谋求改善自己的情况，必须屈从美国罪恶的战争政策而不能反对，必须博取帝国主义者的欢心，而不要反对帝国主义者并与之进行斗争。”
    罗加说，现在，“古巴革命不是共产主义革命；是反帝国主义的和反大庄园制度的革命。从它所面临的和实现着的历史任务看，它可以被认为是民族解放的和土地的革命，是爱国的和民主的革命。从坚持和推动它的阶级力量和它所采取的激进的方法看，可以认为它是先进的人民革命。”
    罗加谴责帝国主义及其走狗进行反共。他指出，反共是帝国主义及其走狗反对革命、反对人民正当愿望的武器，“任何陷入反共罗网的人，都是自觉或不自觉地为美帝国主义者、大庄园主以及他们驯顺的走狗所抱的反革命、压迫和剥削目的服务的”。
    罗加列举了革命所面临的以及它正在实现的历史任务，这些任务包括：恢复和行使国家主权，消灭大庄园制，废除给公司和私人的使古巴负担沉重的租让权，实行国家工业化，实现人民真正的和最广泛的民主，执行和发展独立的对外政策，加强起义军、工农民兵和保安机构，巩固和发展革命的国家，等等。
    罗加指出，“这个政府代表和执行无产阶级、农民、小资产阶级以及民族资产阶级的进步阶层非正式的和不成文的联盟的政策”，“从它的成分来说，主要是小资产阶级、农民和无产阶级的联盟”。罗加指出，“革命政权不是临时政权，虽然它还并不具有肯定的形式和政治体制。革命政权建立起来是为了把革命进行到底”。
    罗加驳斥了帝国主义关于古巴没有进行选举的攻击，他说，“人民懂得，首先应该解决革命的基本问题，然后再进行选举”。罗加指出，“古巴已经举行了鲜血和斗争的选举。古巴用鲜血和反对暴政的斗争投了票，并且击败了暴政”。
    罗加说，“头号敌人美帝国主义者已经成了国际反动派的宪兵，成了全世界一切反动倒退力量的朋友和一切进步、民主、人民和革命的运动以及社会主义和共产主义运动的敌人，不管这些运动是在哪里产生和发展的。”他又说，在古巴内部，“大庄园主、大商人、进口商、富豪和与帝国主义及大庄园制度有联系的剥削者、官僚资本家和在独裁政权的扶植和帮助下形成的垄断寡头是完全地和顽固地反对古巴革命的主要社会集团。”
    罗加在谈到古巴革命的力量和朋友时说，“古巴革命的主要社会力量是工人阶级、农民阶级和城市小资产阶级，他们一起构成了古巴人民，贫苦大众。”他说，“从革命中得到利益的资产阶级支持革命，但是对革命所采取的激进措施，对美帝国主义的威胁、恫吓、和攻击常常感到害怕，并且由于它对未来的恐惧而怀疑和动摇。”他说，“工人阶级是直接给革命做出最大贡献的阶级，是第一个为革命的胜利和前进做出必要的牺牲和采取必要的行动的阶级”。“工人阶级在保卫革命和推进革命的任务中站在一切阶级和阶层的前面。”
    罗加说，古巴革命“不仅拥有强大的内部力量，而且还拥有拉丁美洲国家、亚非国家和社会主义国家人民、工人、和平拥护者、进步人士和全世界各国人民的积极的支援和深切的友谊”。他指出，“拉丁美洲任何一个国家在争取国家主权和建立坚决反对美帝国主义的革命政府上取得的进展，无疑都意味着对古巴的最大援助。”他强调指出，“社会主义各国自动和慷慨提供的援助对古巴革命是具有决定意义的。这种援助是根据指导着它们的政策的马克思列宁主义的无产阶级国际主义原则和援助为反对帝国主义、争取自由和独立而斗争的国家的原则进行的。”他说，古巴人民感谢苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家以及世界人民所给予的支持。
    罗加在谈到国际形势时指出，“社会主义的高涨与帝国主义的危机和没落适成对比。帝国主义对许多国家的统治发生了危机。”“在整个拉丁美洲，坚决反对帝国主义的运动和斗争不断高涨。支援古巴的群众行动就是反对帝国主义的强有力的证明。”罗加强调指出，“美帝国主义者继续奉行着战争政策，这种政策保持和加剧国际紧张局势，破坏国际上为争取禁止原子武器和运载这些武器的工具、并达成有监督的裁军的协议而作的努力。”“美国勾结蒋介石这个逃跑了的亚洲的巴蒂斯塔，非法地占领着中国的台湾岛，处在反对中华人民共和国的潜在的战争状态中，利用第七舰队侵占着中华人民共和国的领海。”“美国继续奉行它的战争政策，使从远东的日本到欧洲尖端的西班牙的世界上布满了军事基地。”
    罗加在谈到美国在古巴的关塔那摩海军基地时强调指出，这不仅是对古巴，而且也是对大西洋沿岸拉丁美洲各国的经常威胁和进行挑衅的中心。他说，“为了和平、各国人民的安全以及各国的主权和独立，美国这些遍布世界和在拉丁美洲建立的军事基地应该取消。”“目前的国际形势是：共同反对帝国主义侵略的社会主义、民族解放运动及维护和平运动的力量比帝国主义、殖民主义及热衷于加剧国际紧张局势和战争的势力更强大和有力。”罗加说，“我们知道，社会主义阵营、独立国家和全世界和平拥护者的力量依靠不断地进行努力和继续保持警惕，能够束缚住帝国主义战争挑拨者的手；避免战争的危险，保持和平，建立和平共处”。
    罗加在谈到古巴的局势时说，只要武装部队和为进行真正的全民战争而团结起来的人民做好准备，再加上国际上的支持，是能够防止美国的军事干涉，或者在发生军事干涉时把它打败的。
    罗加在谈到反动活动时指出，“最近，我们这里也出现了铁托分子的主张。这些设法和帝国主义妥协、制止革命、并把革命引向失败的分子，把南斯拉夫看作他们学习的榜样。他们冒充革命者，而为反革命的主张进行宣传。他们是被吓坏了的特务，可是他们不逃跑，而是散布怯懦情绪，散布恐惧和混乱。反革命叛徒竭力宣传德热拉斯以及南斯拉夫其他修正主义者的作品，这并不是偶然的；右派分子和反动分子都力图把南斯拉夫说成是非常支持古巴革命的，虽然实际上它的援助是微不足道的，这也不是偶然的。美国决不会允许它做更多的事情。”
    罗加在报告中谈到了古巴的土地改革、为收回国家主权而进行的斗争以及经济情况。他说，“实际上，半封建的大庄园制在古巴已经不存在了。”“在实行土地改革的同时，农业生产日益增长和多样化。”罗加说：在土地改革的发展过程中，农民协会逐渐发展成为农民的组织形式，农民协会的领导人是贫农和中农。罗加强调指出，“农民只有通过说服，只有自愿才应该加入合作社的原则应该严格遵守。”罗加指出，把美国企业收归国有“是对帝国主义在古巴的经济统治的致命打击。这是争取经济独立的决定性步骤，是政治独立的主要基础和保障。”
    罗加谈到了古巴同社会主义国家的经济关系及其对古巴经济发展的重要性。他说，“古巴与社会主义国家建立的经济和贸易关系使古巴得以抵抗住了美国的一切压力，粉碎了美国的经济侵略以及它的罪恶阴谋和对（古巴）国民经济的破坏。”“我们同一些社会主义国家，如中华人民共和国、德意志民主共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国等还没有外交关系。我们希望，旧政权遗留下来的妨碍建立这种关系的障碍将被排除。蒋介石的代表在我国无所事事。他们不代表中国，而仅仅代表一个无耻的暴君，一个像巴蒂斯塔一样的外国的奴才。在古巴的代表应该是与我们有友好关系的中国的代表。”
    罗加随后谈到了保卫与推进古巴革命的问题。他说，“保卫革命和推进革命是中心任务，这一点并没有过时。”“美国现在没有放弃，将来也不会放弃对古巴革命的进攻。一次进攻失败就会开始另一次进攻。一条道路行不通就再找另一条。逃亡美国和仍然在我国领土上进行活动的战争罪犯、窃贼、特务和以前的大庄园主也决不会放弃对古巴革命的进攻。”罗加说，美帝国主义者为取得拉丁美洲各国及其他盟国政府的合作来进攻革命的主要工具就是美洲国家组织，这个组织“是美国的殖民部，它的虚伪的借口是臆造的苏联干涉和同样臆造出来的‘国际共产主义威胁’这种荒诞无稽的说法，他们曾利用同样的借口为他们对危地马拉犯下的滔天大罪寻找了口实。”
    罗加强调指出，“保卫革命和推进革命要求做好准备来抵抗和击退任何势力对古巴发动的任何武装进攻，不管他们打的是什么旗号，美洲国家组织的也罢，美国的也罢，它的任何一个卫星国政府的也罢，反革命的也罢。”
    关于党，罗加指出，“革命不能寄托在自然的发展和群众的自发性上，动员起来的群众无疑是历史的决定性力量。但是，这些群众如果没有一个以马克思主义的革命思想和一个革命纲领为基础的有组织的力量的领导，他们就可能浪费和毫无价值地消耗自己的力量，采取无政府主义的和分散的行动。受到群众拥戴，同时又能倾听群众意见，和群众结合在一起并且正确引导群众前进的具有作领导者的条件的大人物，在他们根据历史需要和革命的要求进行工作的时候，能起重大的作用。但是，他们不能取代要有组织的必要性，而是使这种需要更加迫切。只有革命的组织才能使革命活动不论在局势如何动荡的情况下稳定和继续下去，才能使构成人民的数百万人的日常行动配合起来”。罗加说，“我们党是古巴革命有组织的力量之一”。他指出，所有这些有组织的力量今天都在革命领袖菲德尔·卡斯特罗的领导下，保持紧密的配合和合作地团结行动。“我们相信，由于革命的发展，由于在革命力量日益紧密的配合和合作中得到的进步，在适当的时刻，能够而且应该达到完全的团结，即所有的力量都联合成一个统一的运动。”
    罗加最后指出，必须大大地加强和改进党的思想工作，提高党员和所有忠诚和坚定的革命者的马克思列宁主义思想水平。他说，同时必须保持党的队伍的纯洁，清洗机会主义分子、制造混乱的分子、任何修正主义分子或坏分子。
