Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 22nd: In the past two to three months, workers in more than thirty printing and dyeing factories in Shanghai have gathered various innovation projects created during the technical revolution movement, comprehensively improved them, and integrated them into a complete set of new continuous production processes. Currently, one-third of the city's printing and dyeing factories have retrofitted their original equipment according to this new process, achieving continuous production; the remaining factories are also actively carrying out equipment transformation.

In many factories using the new printing and dyeing process, from the entry of greige fabric into the workshop, through scouring, bleaching, dyeing, printing to finished product packaging, everything is controlled by an electrical control panel. The past ten or even dozens of cumbersome and repetitive processes have now been formed into a simplified and continuous production process. Workers who used to stand next to high-temperature boiling pots and toss fabric are now sitting comfortably at the central control panel. With the push of a button, the machine starts, and a white fabric, like a dragon emerging from the sea, travels around the factory, automatically dyeing, automatically printing, and automatically heading towards the finished product packaging workshop at the exit. Therefore, production efficiency has greatly improved. General daily output has increased by 30% to 50%, labor productivity has increased two to three times, coal and water consumption has been reduced by more than half, and product quality has also improved.

Over the past few years, employees in Shanghai's printing and dyeing industry have made many improvements to the original old equipment. Since the beginning of this year, in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the "Four Modernizations," workers in various factories have created many new equipment, new technologies, and new processes that combine indigenous and foreign methods, targeting weak links in production. For example, in the technical revolution movement, workers at the Lixin Third Printing and Dyeing Factory adopted the rope-like high-efficiency alkali rolling and steaming process, thereby abolishing the desizing tank, cloth accumulation tank, bleaching tank, acid tank, and the large boiling pot, connecting the original three or five-stage intermittent processing methods into a single line. Finally, the scouring and bleaching process was changed from traditional low-efficiency, multi-process intermittent production to high-efficiency, fewer-process continuous production. The original production process took twenty hours, now shortened to just over two hours. Li Jinyuan, an old worker at Guanghua Printing and Dyeing Factory, created a local method of a "liquid rheostat" using three spittoons, a bamboo pole, and three copper wires, connecting ten processes, from dyeing and priming to finished product packaging, and realized automated continuous production with electrical adjustment control. The employees of Yong'an Printing and Dyeing Factory further abolished all the cumbersome processes of high-pressure boiling, hot water washing, mercerization, priming, dyeing, printing, sizing, and whitening in the printing and dyeing industrial production process, which involved wetting then drying, drying then wetting, and wetting again. They replaced these with new processes, which not only shortened the time and reduced the processes, but also reduced coal and electricity consumption, creating more favorable conditions for achieving continuous production.

The achievements of the technological revolution at Lixin, Guanghua, Yong'an and other factories have found a path of more, faster, better, and more economical ways to comprehensively and rapidly change the backward situation of the printing and dyeing industry. The Shanghai Textile Industry Bureau and Printing and Dyeing Company promptly seized these advanced typical examples and organized technical forces from various relevant units, including factories, the Textile Science Research Institute, the Textile Engineering College, the Bureau, and the Company, to form a research group. On the one hand, they summarized and improved the creations of the workers in the three factories, and on the other hand, they concentrated the creations scattered in various factories, learned from each other's strengths, and created a complete set of new printing and dyeing industrial processes, which were promoted throughout the industry.

The promotion of the new process was also carried out in a mass movement. The workers and technicians of Tongji Printing and Dyeing Factory formed ten combat teams to visit and learn from more than twenty fraternal factories. After returning, they held extensive discussions on how to apply the new process according to the conditions of their factory. After the design drawings for the machine modification were drawn, they were published on the wall for all workers to offer opinions and make modifications. This fully mobilized the masses, so that the project, which was originally considered difficult to complete in the short term, was completed in two weeks.

    上海印染业实行生产连续化
    日产量提高30％到50％，劳动生产率提高两倍，
    煤水消耗量节约一半以上，产品质量也有提高
    据新华社上海22日电　上海市三十多个印染工厂的职工在最近两三个月里，把技术革命运动中创造的各个革新项目集中起来，加以综合提高，配套成龙，形成了一套连续化生产的新工艺。目前全市已有三分之一的印染厂按照这一新工艺，改装了原有的设备，实现了生产连续化；其余的工厂也正在积极进行设备改造工作。
    在许多使用了印染新工艺的工厂里，从坯布进车间，经过炼漂、染色、印花到成品打包，都由电气操纵台控制，过去的十多道以至几十道烦琐重复的工序，现在已经形成为简化和连续化的生产过程。原来站在温度很高的煮布锅旁甩布的工人，现在轻松地坐在中央操纵台上，电钮一揿，机器转动起来，一条白布就像蛟龙出海，环游全厂，自动染色，自动印花，自动奔向出口处的成品包装车间。因此生产效率大大提高。一般日产量提高30％到50％，劳动生产率提高两倍到三倍，煤和水的消耗量节约一半以上，产品的质量也有提高。
    几年来，上海印染行业职工对原来的旧设备曾经作了不少改进。今年以来各厂职工在以“四化”为中心的技术革新技术革命运动中，又针对生产中的薄弱环节，创造了许多土法与洋法相结合的新设备、新技术、新工艺。例如丽新第三印染厂职工在技术革命运动中，采用了绳状高效轧碱汽蒸的工艺方法，从而废除了退浆池、积布池、漂箱、酸箱和庞大的煮布锅，使原来分成三段或五段间歇式的加工方法连成一条线，终于把炼漂过程从传统的低效、多工序间歇生产，改为高效、少工序的连续化生产，原来生产过程要二十个小时，现在缩短到两个多小时。光华印染厂老工人李金源，用三只痰盂、一根竹竿、三根铜丝作试验，创造了土法“液体变阻器”，把从染色、打底到成品包装等十道工艺过程连接起来，实现了用电气调节控制自动化连续生产。永安印染厂的职工，进一步把印染工业生产过程中高压煮炼、热水洗涤、丝光、打底、染色、印花、上浆、加白等湿了干、干了湿、湿了再干的烦琐工艺全部废除，代之以新工艺，不但缩短了时间，减少了工序，还降低了煤电消耗，为实现生产连续化创造了更有利的条件。
    丽新、光华、永安等厂工艺技术大革命的成果，为全面迅速地改变印染工业落后面貌找到了一条多快好省的道路。上海纺织工业局、印染公司，及时抓住这些先进典型，组织了包括工厂、纺织科学院、纺织工学院、局、公司等各有关单位的技术力量，成立研究小组，一方面总结提高三个厂职工的创造，一方面把分散在各厂的创造集中起来，取长补短，配成完整的一套印染工业新工艺，在全行业作了推广。
    新工艺的推广，也是在大搞群众运动中进行的。同济印染厂的工人和技术人员们组成了十个战斗队，到二十多家兄弟厂去参观学习，回来后展开了广泛的讨论，如何根据本厂条件来应用新工艺。改装机器的设计图画出以后，即在墙上公布出来，由全体工人提意见，加以修改。这样充分发动群众，使原来认为短期内难以改装完毕的工程，在两个星期内便完成了。
