Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 28th: The Lin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province insists that cadres go deep into the front lines of production, focusing on the current step and looking ahead to the next, pushing the laggards to catch up with the advanced, and conscientiously improving the leadership level of production team cadres, so that the county's leadership work is carried out solidly, powerfully promoting production throughout the county.

Last autumn, the county widely implemented the working method of cadres and the masses eating, living, working, and discussing together. Nearly 80% of the county and commune cadres went deep into the front lines of production, and the cadres' work style was down-to-earth and meticulous. Since the beginning of this summer, in order to strive for increased autumn production, the Lin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the work experience of cadres going deep into the front lines of production in the previous stage, summarized a method of deploying cadre forces into three groups: one group, led by a secretary, was stationed to command and grasp the overall situation; another group went deep into key areas to investigate and study, carefully solve key problems in current work, discover and promote advanced experiences, and study and consider the next stage of work; and a third group specialized in making a concentrated effort to transform backward areas. This enables all work in the county to achieve a combination of points and areas, top-down coordination, interlocking links, and proactive steps.

Going deep into reality for investigation and research, grasping the first step, preparing for the second step, and considering the third step are the most outstanding aspects of the Lin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in guiding the county to strive for a bumper autumn harvest. Every time the County Party Committee First Secretary Yang Gui arranged and deployed work throughout the county, he would take some cadres to go deep into the grassroots, conscientiously conduct investigations and research, solve key problems in current work, and consider the next step of work. Before this year's wheat harvest, due to his in-depth investigation and research and widespread absorption of mass opinions, he formulated three different plans for sowing late autumn crops, respectively, targeting three possible weather changes after the wheat harvest (one was to continue the drought that had lasted for more than 200 days from last winter to this spring; the second was even rainfall; and the third was only a small rain), and made meticulous preparations throughout the county. Therefore, when a small rain fell just after the wheat harvest, the entire county mobilized and worked hard for two days and nights, so that all late autumn crops were sown in a timely manner. After that, just as people were tensely fighting drought to protect seedlings, the County Party Committee discussed with the masses a complete set of methods for quickly eliminating weeds in the rainy season, and implemented them throughout the county, preventing the development of weed infestation early this rainy season. Before the beginning of autumn, the County Party Committee, in response to the "After the beginning of autumn, hang up the hoe" mentality of waiting for a good harvest, conducted investigations and research early, tapped potential, formulated measures to strengthen late-stage management according to crop types, and made full preparations for launching a super-production campaign after the beginning of autumn. At the same time, the County Party Committee also deeply summarized the experience of increasing wheat production over the years, formulated a wheat planting plan, and communes and teams universally signed contracts for next year's wheat production, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses for striving for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

In terms of autumn harvest preparation, the County Party Committee, in response to the problem that some sweet potatoes were always rotten in previous years, deeply summarized the experience of the masses and formulated methods to prevent sweet potato rot. Under the leadership of the County Party Committee, the county quickly launched a production upsurge with the focus on conscientiously strengthening the late-stage management of autumn fields and the simultaneous progress of autumn harvest and autumn plowing preparation work. According to statistics, the county has accumulated more than 2.2 billion catties of fertilizer for wheat fields in just the past ten days, and prepared 165,000 tools for autumn harvest and autumn planting. In the past few days, some autumn crops in the county have suffered from insect pests. Commune members have worked hard for five days, basically eliminating the insect pests, and have applied additional fertilizer to autumn fields, upgrading some of the third-class seedlings. The county's autumn vegetable production is also well-managed, not only ensuring that there are sufficient vegetables at present, but also a large amount of reserves.

Continuously improving the leadership level of production team cadres is another fundamental measure taken by the Lin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party after the cadres went deep into the front lines. More than 1,600 county and commune cadres went deep into the front lines of production, and most of the cadres had their own key production teams. More than 400 of them were fixed in the production teams as deputy captains, taking apprentices and acting as consultants in specific work to help production team cadres improve their level. County Party Committee secretaries and members also often went deep into the production teams as captains or canteen cooks and managers, to deeply understand and study the problems in grassroots leadership work, and to set an example for all county and commune cadres sent to the production teams. In July, Yang Gui, First Secretary of the County Party Committee, and Zhou Shaoxian and Qin Zhihua, secretaries of the Secretariat, Lu Jialin, Minister of the Organization Department, and others, went deep into Zhang Guanying of Yaocun Commune and Shencun Brigade of Heshun Commune, conducted more than half a month of investigation and research, and comprehensively and systematically understood the problems existing in grassroots leadership work. After Yang Gui went to the canteen as a manager, he found that the cadres here only focused on production and not on life, and immediately organized a group of cadres to go to the canteen as cooks and managers, strengthening the leadership of the canteen. After the canteen was well-managed, the masses' enthusiasm for striving for increased autumn production was even higher. During this period, they also found that many grassroots cadres had high work enthusiasm and great drive, but were not good at organizing the power of the masses, so their work was busy and chaotic. They patiently helped the grassroots cadres summarize their experiences, and put forward the opinions on being a good team leader: "Thousands of pounds of burdens are shouldered by everyone, political work is the most important, come up with good ideas and use soldiers well, there must be an active layer, a determination and a burst of energy, be selfless in doing things, take the lead in doing practical work, and take good care of people's lives." Subsequently, a discussion was launched at the county's four-level cadre meeting. Many production team leaders reflected that after the discussion, they had more confidence in doing their job well.

    紧抓第一步　准备第二步　考虑第三步
    林县干部深入下去扎扎实实领导生产
    各项工作都做到点面结合　上下呼应　环环扣紧　步步主动
    新华社郑州28日电　中共河南省林县县委坚持干部深入生产第一线，抓当前一步、看下一步，抓后进赶先进，认真提高生产队干部的领导水平，使全县领导工作进行得扎扎实实，有力地推动了全县生产。
    这个县去年秋天普遍推行了干部和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量的工作方法，将近80％的县、社干部都深入到生产第一线，干部作风踏实细致。今年入夏以来，为争取秋季增产，中共林县县委根据前一阶段干部深入生产第一线的工作经验，总结出分三套人马部署干部力量的办法：一套人马由一位书记坐阵指挥、掌握全盘；一套深入重点，调查研究，细致解决当前工作中的关键问题，发现和推广先进经验，并且研究考虑下一段工作；一套专门突击改造落后地区。从而使全县各项工作都做到了点面结合，上下呼应，环环扣紧，步步主动。
    深入实际调查研究，抓第一步、准备第二步、考虑第三步，这是中共林县县委在指导全县争取秋季丰收的斗争中，抓得最出色的一条。县委第一书记杨贵每次在安排部署全县工作以后，便带着一部分干部深入基层，认真进行调查研究，一边解决当前工作中的关键问题，一边考虑下一步的工作。今年麦收前，由于他深入调查研究，广泛吸取了群众意见，针对在麦收后可能发生的三种天气变化（一是在去冬今春持续干旱二百多天的基础上再继续干旱；二是雨水调匀；三是只下一场很小的雨），分别制订了三个不同的播种晚秋作物的方案，在全县进行了周密准备。因而当麦收刚过下了一场小雨的时候，全县人马立即出动，大干两日夜，使晚秋作物全部及时下种。此后，正当人们紧张抗旱保苗的时候，县委又和群众商量出一整套如何在雨季尽快消灭草荒的办法，在全县贯彻执行，及早制止了今年雨季草荒的发展。立秋前夕，县委针对
  “立了秋，挂锄钩”的坐等丰收思想，及早进行调查研究，大挖潜力，按作物种类制订出加强后期管理的措施，为立秋后开展超产运动进行了充分准备。与此同时，县委并深入总结了历年小麦增产经验，制订出小麦播种方案，社社队队普遍签订了明年的小麦包产合同，调动了广大群众争取明年小麦丰收的积极性。
    在秋收准备工作方面，县委针对历年都要烂坏一些红芋的问题，深入总结群众经验，制订了防止红芋腐烂的办法。在县委的领导下，全县迅速展开了以认真加强秋田后期管理为中心的、秋收秋耕准备工作同时并进的生产高潮。据统计，全县仅在最近十几天内，便为麦田积肥二十二亿多斤，并为秋收、秋种准备工具十六万五千件。最近几天，全县有一部分秋禾发生虫害，社员们大干五天，基本上消灭了虫害，并且又为秋田追施了肥料，使一部分三类苗都升了级。全县的秋菜生产也管理得很好，不但保证了目前有充足的蔬菜，还有大量储备。
    不断提高生产队干部的领导水平，是中共林县县委在干部深入第一线以后采取的又一项根本措施。全县有一千六百多名县、社干部深入生产第一线，绝大部分干部都有自己的重点生产队，其中有四百多人固定在生产队当副队长，在具体工作中带徒弟、当参谋，帮助生产队干部提高水平。县委书记和委员们也经常深入生产队当队长或食堂的炊事员、管理员，深入了解和研究基层领导工作中的问题，并为所有下放到生产队的县、社干部树立榜样。7月间，县委第一书记杨贵和书记处书记周绍先、秦志华，组织部长路加林等，深入到姚村公社的张官营和河顺公社的申村大队，作了半个多月的调查研究，全面系统地了解了基层领导工作中存在的问题。杨贵到食堂当管理员以后，发现这里的干部只抓生产不抓生活，立即组织了一部分干部深入到食堂里当炊事员、管理员，加强了对食堂的领导。食堂办好以后，群众争取秋季增产的干劲更加高涨了。在这期间，他们还发现许多基层干部工作热情高，干劲大，但不善于组织群众的力量，因而工作忙乱。他们便耐心帮助基层干部总结经验，提出了当好小队长的意见：“千斤担子众人担，政治工作最当先，出好主意用好兵，要有一个积极层，一个决心一股劲，大公无私办事情，带头实干做榜样，搞好生活关心人。”随后，又在全县四级干部会议上展开讨论。许多生产队长反映说，经过讨论，他们对做好工作更有信心了。（附图片）
