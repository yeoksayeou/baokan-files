    Fifty Pairs of Old Stockings
    In the department store section of the Zhengkou Store in Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, a young girl was busy sewing together a pile of old stockings under the light, working late into the night. Early the next morning, she carried a bundle of sewn-up old stockings on her back and rushed to the millet fields of the Wuhu Production Team in Zhengkou Commune.

    This girl is Tan Xiuju, a saleswoman at the Zhengkou Store. The day before, when she was delivering goods to the work site, she passed by the millet fields of the Wuhu Production Team and saw the commune members busily removing insects. However, there were many people but few pesticide application tools. Someone came up with an idea: use old stockings to hold the 666 powder and shake it along the furrows, which could replace the tools. But where would they get so many old stockings? Tan Xiuju suddenly remembered that their waste recycling station had collected a lot of old stockings; they could be used if the holes were sewn up. A passion to help the peasants reclaim the millet from the mouths of the insects motivated her. That night, she went to the waste recycling station, found a large pile of old stockings, and sewed up fifty pairs overnight.

    The commune members, having received the stockings she brought, significantly improved their work efficiency and completed the insect removal task in half a day.

    五十双旧袜筒
    在河北吴桥县郑口商店的百货门市部里，一位年青的姑娘在灯下忙着缝连一堆旧袜筒，一直忙到深夜。第二天一早，她就背上一包袱缝好的旧袜筒，赶到郑口公社五户生产队的谷子地去了。
    这位姑娘是郑口商店的售货员谭秀菊。头天她到工地送货时，路过五户生产队的谷子地，看见社员们正在紧张地除虫。但当时人多药械少。有人想了个办法：用旧袜筒装上六六六粉顺垅抖动，可以代替器械。可是，那来这么多的旧袜筒呢？谭秀菊忽然想到，他们的废品收购站收购了很多旧袜筒，只要把窟窿缝一缝就能用。一种帮助农民从虫嘴里夺回谷子的热情激励着她，当天夜里，她就到废品收购站找了一大堆旧袜筒，连夜赶缝了五十双。
    社员们得到她带来的袜筒，工作效率显著提高，半天就完成了除虫任务。
