Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 4th: The First Automobile Works of Changchun and the Changchun Locomotive Works have jointly produced a narrow-gauge railway vehicle to support transportation in mines across the country.

This railway vehicle has 95 horsepower, a wheel gauge of 762 millimeters, and can pull 100 tons of cargo, traveling at 25 to 40 kilometers per hour. It can use gasoline as fuel, or be equipped with a gas generator, using coal and wood as fuel, making it very suitable for light railway and dirt railway transportation in mines. After trial identification by relevant state departments, the two factories are accelerating production preparations, planning for mass production.

To meet the urgent needs of mine transportation, these two fraternal factories have produced more than 1,000 broad-gauge railway vehicles with a wheel gauge of 1,435 millimeters for various parts of the country since the beginning of this year.
