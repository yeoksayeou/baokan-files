Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, Leopoldville Dispatch: When a group of Congolese youth held a demonstration in the Congolese capital of Leopoldville on the 7th, they delivered speeches denouncing the US-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization's aggressive bloc's conspiracy to divide the Congo.

These slogan-chanting, fist-clenching Congolese youth marched through the streets holding banners and placards with slogans such as, "If the Belgians don't get out of Katanga within 24 hours, Congolese youth will be mobilized," and "Down with the Belgian murderers."

The Congolese youth also demonstrated in front of the Belgian Embassy and the United Nations headquarters in the Congo. They shouted slogans outside the UN headquarters and demanded a meeting with the American, Bunch, who commands the UN forces. However, this American refused to meet with the demonstrators. According to reports, a leader of the demonstrators, in a conversation with reporters, condemned the United Nations for participating in the conspiracy to separate the Katanga province of the Congo from the Congo, thereby undermining Congolese sovereignty.

The demonstrators also demanded the overthrow of the secessionist "government" of Katanga province, controlled by Tshombe, an agent of foreign monopoly capital.

It is reported that when the youth demonstrated, UN soldiers, commanded by British officers and with bayonets fixed, were deployed around the Belgian Embassy and the UN headquarters in the Congo, and set up light machine guns on the sidewalks, threatening the demonstrators.

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, Accra Dispatch: After talks in Accra between Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and Ghanaian President Nkrumah, a joint communique was issued today stating that if the United Nations cannot effectively and rapidly withdraw Belgian troops from the entire Congo, they will establish a supreme military command together with other independent African countries to expedite the withdrawal of Belgian troops from the Congo.

Nkrumah and Lumumba condemned Belgium for refusing to withdraw its troops from the Congo.

They also called on all other countries to support their demand: that Belgian troops should withdraw from the entire territory of the Congo, including the Belgian military bases of Kitona and Kamina in the Congo.

Lumumba arrived in Accra on the evening of the 7th. After ending his visit to Guinea on the 7th, he flew to Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, and held talks with Liberian President Tubman.
