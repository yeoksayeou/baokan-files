    Contemporary Hero
    Teng Huimin, a representative of the National Congress of Heroes, a milling machine operator and Communist Party member at the Harbin Electric Tool and Cutter Factory, has not produced a single defective product for five and a half consecutive years. In the first half of this year, he improved eight advanced cutting tools and created many advanced experiences, completing the workload of one year and four months. He has recently been promoted to assistant engineer. This is Teng Huimin (second from the left) helping workers in the chain group of his workshop master new methods of grinding small drill bits. With his active assistance, this group has jumped from a backward group to an advanced group in the entire factory. Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Wanqing Photo

    当代英雄
    全国群英会代表、哈尔滨电具刃具厂磨工、共产党员滕惠民，连续五年半没有出过一件废品，今年上半年又改进了八项先进刀具，创造了许多种先进经验，已经完成了一年零四个月的工作量。最近他已被提升为助理工程师。这是滕惠民（左二）正在帮助本车间关链小组工人掌握磨小钻头的新方法。在他的主动帮助下，这个小组由后进小组一跃而为全厂的先进小组。　新华社记者　许万青摄
