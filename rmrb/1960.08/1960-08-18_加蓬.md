Gabon

Gabon is an equatorial African country bordering the Atlantic Ocean, with an area of 267,000 square kilometers and a population of over 410,000. The capital is Libreville.

In the late fifteenth century, the Portuguese were the first to invade Gabon. In the eighteenth century, French missionaries and merchants began to invade. In 1891, French colonists turned the entire Gabon into its colony.

80% of Gabon's land is covered with lush primeval forests, rich in various precious timbers such as ebony. Timber accounts for about three-quarters of the total export value in foreign trade. In addition, it also produces cocoa, coffee, cotton and peanuts; and contains large deposits of oil, iron, manganese, uranium, gold, diamonds, and abundant natural gas resources. However, the people of this rich country have long lived in misery under the exploitation of French colonialism.

After World War II, American monopoly capital tried its best to infiltrate Gabon and intensified the plunder of its manganese and iron ore resources. American "investment" is also constantly increasing. In the Mekambo Iron Ore Company, the investment of the American Bethlehem Steel Company accounts for 50%.

The people of Gabon have been fighting for national independence for a long time. In particular, the working class of Gabon plays an increasingly important role in the struggle. In February last year, a large-scale anti-French uprising broke out in Gabon. Students in Lambaréné, a city in central Gabon, attacked officials of the colonial government during a demonstration. Under the pressure of the Gabonese people's struggle for national independence, France had to agree to Gabon's declaration of independence within the "French Community." (Attached picture)

    加蓬
    加蓬是一个濒临大西洋的赤道非洲国家，面积二十六万七千平方公里，人口四十一万多，首都是利伯维尔。
    十五世纪末叶，葡萄牙人首先侵入加蓬。十八世纪，法国的传教士和商人开始侵入。1891年法国殖民者把整个加蓬变成了它的殖民地。
    加蓬80％的土地复盖着蓊郁的原始森林，盛产黑檀木等各种名贵的木材。在对外贸易中，木材占出口总额的四分之三左右。此外，它还出产可可、咖啡、棉花和花生；蕴藏着大量的石油、铁、锰、铀、金、金刚石，以及丰富的天然煤气资源。但是，这个富饶国家的人民在法国殖民主义压榨下，长期以来却生活在苦难中。
    美国垄断资本在第二次世界大战后竭力渗入加蓬，加紧掠夺那里的锰矿和铁矿等资源。美国“投资”也在不断增加，在梅坎博铁矿公司中，美国的伯利恒钢铁公司的投资就占了50％。
    加蓬人民为了争取民族独立，长期以来进行着斗争。特别是加蓬的工人阶级，在斗争中起着日益重要的作用。去年2月，在加蓬爆发了大规模的反法起义，加蓬中部的兰巴雷尼城的学生在示威中袭击了殖民政府的官员。在加蓬人民争取民族独立斗争的压力下，法国不得不同意加蓬宣告在“法兰西共同体”内独立。（附图片）
