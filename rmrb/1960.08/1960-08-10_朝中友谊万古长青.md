　　China-Korea Friendship Will Last Forever
　　Korea　Li Yangxie
　　Every mountain and river, every blade of grass and tree in Korea, and the hearts of every Korean man, woman, and child, will forever cherish the profound friendship with the great Chinese people.

　　The village where Comrade Kim Kyung-ha serves as the chairman of the People's Committee of the ri (Korean village administrative unit) is located near the Military Demarcation Line. From the summit of Bonghwa Mountain in front of the village, one can see the scattered and dilapidated thatched-roof houses of farmers south of the Military Demarcation Line. However, on this side of the Military Demarcation Line, the village is surrounded by lush green rice paddies covering the fields. Walking through this delightful farmland and entering the village entrance, one sees the red-tiled school building. In the courtyard, there is a circular flower bed, blooming with fragrant and colorful flowers such as impatiens and peonies. Here, the words "China-Korea Friendship Will Last Forever" are inlaid with white pebbles. In the school's faculty room, the agricultural cooperative's management committee office, and many other rooms, red banners embroidered with golden threads bearing the words "Friendship Forever" are hung on the walls.

　　All of these are symbols of the friendship left behind by the brave warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

　　The people of the village, in their thriving lives, forever preserve these stone-inlaid slogans and banners. Whenever they see them, they cannot help but remember their close Chinese friends who shared life and death, hardship, and shed blood and sweat together.

　　At the end of 1950, the soldiers of the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign first came to this village. From that time until the withdrawal of troops in the spring of 1958, the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers lived with the people here for eight years. The "Kim Jeong-soon" hand grenade movement, launched by a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers that we are familiar with, is a story that took place in this village. Whenever the people of the village recall this story, they vividly remember the noble style and brotherly friendship of the internationalist soldiers – the brave warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteers. This story took place in August 1957. To welcome the "August 1st" Army Day, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers held a heroes' conference in the valley of Mount Maryang, northeast of this village. After the conference, the people of the village performed programs they had prepared for a long time. The announcer introduced the solo performance of Kim Jeong-soon. Then, Kim Jeong-soon, a first-grade student at the People's School, stepped onto the stage, which was temporarily built with logs, amidst enthusiastic applause. However, she did not sing for a long time. The Volunteer warriors thought she was shy and applauded the girl in the colorful shirt even more enthusiastically. However, Kim Jeong-soon still buried her head deeply in her chest, only fiddling with the ribbons of her shirt. Suddenly, she started crying sadly and ran back to the backstage without singing.

　　What was going on? It turned out that Jeong-soon was not from this place. Her family was in Seoul, and her parents had died under the enemy's butcher knives, leaving her alone. When her mother was subjected to brutal torture by the enemy, she tightly hugged her only daughter, Kim Jeong-soon, before her death and told her to "avenge her parents when she grows up." Thus, Jeong-soon, only nine years old, walked more than 170 li alone and sought refuge with her uncle living here.

　　An officer described the above situation to everyone and then said: "She hates the enemy, she wants us to avenge her!"

　　Before the officer finished speaking, the Volunteer warriors rushed up like a swarm of bees and surrounded Kim Jeong-soon. "We will definitely avenge you!" One soldier said, and a loud cry resounded from the crowd: "Eliminate the American devils!"

　　A month later, the People's Committee of the ri here received a letter. It was sent from the front by a Volunteer unit that had once been stationed here. The letter said that in the battle to capture the "216.8" height on the western front, in order to avenge Kim Jeong-soon, each person selected the best hand grenade from their hand grenade bag and wrote Kim Jeong-soon's name on it. The letter wrote: "On this day, we fought enemies several times our strength. Although we did not throw all the hand grenades we carried at the enemy, no one left behind the hand grenade with Kim Jeong-soon's name on it."

　　The people of the village were moved to tears as they read every sentence of this letter.

　　So many Volunteer warriors regarded a Korean girl's hatred as their own hatred, and even on the fierce battlefield, they remembered Kim Jeong-soon's name, and in order to avenge her, they used a hundred times their strength to fiercely attack the enemy. Look! What deep affection is contained in their hearts! Since that evening's performance, the Volunteer warriors have been taking care of this girl, and some soldiers even used their allowances to buy her clothes and shoes.

　　Kim Jeong-soon finished junior high school the year before last and has grown into a lively girl who is both capable and good at singing and dancing. "Look, she has grown into such a lively girl; her rosy cheeks are always smiling, this happy smile was brought to her by the Volunteers." The management committee chairman said, looking at Jeong-soon, who was returning from the farmland, with fatherly love.

　　Righteous friends not only left this eternal deep friendship to Jeong-soon alone, but also brought happiness and joy to everyone in this village.

　　This village experienced four fierce battles. Each time, the villagers only took some clothes and food and evacuated to the rear. The Volunteer comrades sent people to protect the air-raid shelters and property where the villagers lived, so that the villagers would not suffer losses. These soldiers faithfully carried out Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching to "love every mountain and river, every blade of grass and tree in Korea." After the battle, before the villagers returned, these Volunteer comrades had already begun to reinforce or repair the damaged air-raid shelters for the villagers. Sometimes, even under the hail of bullets, they plowed the land and planted crops before the people returned. In order to take care of the returning villagers, they would rather go hungry and distribute their own food to the villagers from house to house. Zhao Jianyuan, an old man, gratefully said to them: "Cutting off my hair to make shoes for you cannot repay one ten-thousandth of your kindness!" That night, the sixty-year-old man ignored the comrades' dissuasion and carried military grain and ammunition to the front line twice, walking more than thirty li back and forth.

　　This feeling is not unique to the old man Zhao Jianyuan.

　　One year, there was a big flood. Nam Seon-bi, a twenty-two-year-old family member of a People's Army soldier, saw the Volunteer soldiers who were going to the front line take off their clothes to cross the river, so she mobilized more than twenty female self-defense team members (at that time, the young and strong all went to the front line, leaving only women in the rear) to organize a shock team to support the Volunteers and build a bridge for them. The enemy's shells exploded like ice, and enemy planes constantly circled overhead to bomb and strafe. However, in order to build the bridge before dark, the women disregarded all dangers and launched an intense battle to build the bridge. In this project, Nam Seon-bi lost her younger brother and was herself injured and fainted. Comrades carried her to the Volunteer hospital. The Volunteer comrades saw that one of her arms had been blown off, and she was in danger of death due to excessive blood loss. They all rushed to give her blood transfusions, gradually restoring her to consciousness. After that, the Volunteer comrades came to visit her every day, hoping that she would recover from her injuries soon.

　　Such deep affection, related by blood, surpasses all noble and beautiful things in the world. No force can separate this friendship between our Chinese and Korean people.

　　The Volunteer comrades regarded the suffering of the Korean people as their own suffering. As long as they could help the people in the village, they would not hesitate to sacrifice everything. They often did not eat lunch or ate less, trying their best to save food and give it to the residents who lacked food at that time. They also built democratic propaganda rooms and schools for this village. When they were about to withdraw their troops, they also broke the ice river, jumped into the water, and built the dam of the reservoir. In order to commemorate them forever, the villagers named it "Friendship Dam" and erected a monument on the dam.

　　"Our lives were just getting better, and the Volunteer comrades have all returned to their country. How happy they would be to see our thriving lives now!" When we visited Nam Seon-bi, she said to us.

　　Before the war, there were a total of four hundred households here, but only twenty-four households remained during the war. Today, this village has built more than 430 houses, as well as clinics, shops, kindergartens, fifteen nurseries, nine democratic propaganda rooms, bathhouses and other cultural and welfare facilities. The villagers, in the agricultural cooperative, exerted the collective creative power, making agricultural output exceed 80% of the Japanese imperialist rule as early as the year before last. The Friendship Dam built for them by the Volunteer comrades irrigates 25% of the total paddy field area. The villagers have also built their own reservoir, naming it "Repaying Gratitude Reservoir," which is irrigating more than 50 jeongbo (Korean unit of area) of paddy fields. The remaining more than 80 jeongbo of dry land have also established an irrigation system.

　　"On the land defended with blood, we will build a beautiful socialist paradise!" The villagers are advancing towards this glorious goal.

　　"You see, when the Volunteer comrades built this house for me, I didn't have anything to put in these two rooms. But now, I have a radio, a sewing machine, a wall clock, a wardrobe and other furniture." Comrade Nam Seon-bi said with a smile, filled with infinite longing for her close friends. The more prosperous the lives they create with their own hands on the road of collectivization guided by our party, the more they miss their closest friends.

　　When I bid farewell to Nam Seon-bi and her husband and came out, I once again looked up affectionately at the plaque hanging on her door that read "Volunteer's Home."

　　The China-Korea friendship that permeates this village, like a legend, will be forever praised by our descendants.

　　The deepening friendship between the peoples of China and Korea, like the Yalu River and Tumen River that flow along our two countries' borders, will forever flow freely in our hearts!

### 朝中友谊万古长青

    朝中友谊万古长青	朝鲜　李阳爕
    朝鲜的一山一水，一草一木，朝鲜每个男女老幼的心中，都永远怀着对伟大中国人民的深厚友情。
    金敬夏同志担任里人民委员会委员长的这个村子，座落在靠近军事分界线的地方。在村前的烽火山顶上，可以望见在军事分界线以南零零散散、破烂不堪的农民的草房。而军事分界线这一边的村庄四周，一片绿油油的水稻盖没了田垅。走过这一片令人喜欢的庄稼地，走进村口，就看见红瓦屋顶的中学校舍。院子里，有圆形的大花圃，盛开着天竺、牡丹等芬芳艳丽的花草。这里用白石子嵌着“中朝友谊万古长青”的字样。学校的教员室、农业社管理委员会办公室和许多屋子里的墙上，都挂着用金线绣着“友谊长存”等字样的红色锦旗。
    所有这些，都是中国人民志愿军勇士们所留下的友谊的象征。
    村里的人们，在欣欣向荣的生活里，永远保存着这些石嵌的标语和锦旗。每当看到它们时，人们就情不自禁地怀念着同生死、共患难，共同流过血汗的亲密的中国朋友。
    1950年年底，抗美援朝战士们第一次来到这个村子。从那时直到1958年春天撤军为止，中国人民志愿军同志们一直和这里的人们共同生活了八年之久。我们所熟悉的中国人民志愿军某部所展开的“金贞顺”手榴弹运动，就是在这个村子里发生的故事。村里的人们，每当想起这个故事，就记忆犹新地感到国际主义战士——中国人民志愿军勇士们的高尚风格和亲如骨肉的情谊。这个故事发生在1957年8月。迎接“八·一”建军节的中国人民志愿军某部，在位于这个村庄东北方的抹阳山山沟里召开了群英大会。大会结束后，村里的人们演出了自己准备已久的节目。报幕员介绍了金贞顺姑娘的独唱节目。接着人民学校一年级学生金贞顺，在热烈的掌声中登上了用原木临时搭成的舞台。但是她久久地没有唱歌。志愿军勇士们以为她害羞，就给这个穿着五彩上衣的少女更加热烈地鼓掌。但是，金贞顺仍旧把头深深地埋在胸前，只是卷弄着上衣的飘带。突然，她伤心地哭起来，没有唱歌就跑回了后台。
    这是怎么一回事呢？原来贞顺不是这个地方的孩子。她家在汉城，爹娘都死在敌人的屠刀下，只剩了她一个人。当她的母亲在遭到敌人的严刑拷打后，临死时紧紧地搂着她仅有的一个女儿——金贞顺，叮嘱她“长大了要给爹娘报仇”。这样，只有九岁的贞顺，一个人走了一百七十多里路，投奔到了住在这里的叔叔家。
    一位军官给大家叙述了上面的情况，接着说：“她恨敌人，她要我们替她报仇！”
    军官还没有说完，志愿军勇士们就一窝蜂似的跑上去团团围住金贞顺。“我们一定给你报仇雪恨！”一个战士说出，人群里响出了宏亮的呼声：“消灭美国鬼子！”
    过了一个月以后，这里的里人民委员会接到了一封信。是曾经在这里驻防过的一支志愿军部队从前方寄来的。信里说，他们在攻占西部战线“二一六点八”高地的战斗中，为了替金贞顺报仇，每人从自己的手榴弹袋中选出最好的一颗，都写上了金贞顺的名字。信里写道：“这天，我们同数倍于我军的敌人战斗，虽然没有把所带的手榴弹全投向敌人，但是，谁也没有剩下写着金贞顺名字的那个手榴弹。”
    村里的人们，念着这封信的每一句话，都感动得流下了眼泪。
    那么多的志愿军勇士们，把一个朝鲜少女的仇恨，当作自己的仇恨，在激烈的战场上也牢记着金贞顺的名字，为了给她报仇雪恨，拿出百倍的力量，狠狠地打击了敌人。看吧！他们的心灵里蕴藏着多么深厚的情谊呀！自从那天晚上的演出会以后，志愿军勇士们一直照顾着这个女孩子，有的战士还用津贴给她买了衣服和鞋子。
    金贞顺前年已经念完了初中，长成了既能干又能歌善舞的活泼的姑娘。“看，她长成了多么活泼的姑娘；红红的脸蛋成天带着微笑，这个幸福的微笑，就是志愿军给她带来的。”管理委员长说着，以父亲般的挚爱的眼神看了看从庄稼地里回来的贞顺。
    正义的朋友们不仅给贞顺一个人留下这种永恒的深情厚谊，而且给这个村庄的每一个人带来了幸福和喜悦。
    这个村子曾经过四次激战。每一次，村里的老百姓都只带一些衣服和粮食疏散到后方去。志愿军同志们就派人保护这些老百姓居住的防空洞和财产，以免老百姓受到损失。这些战士忠实地执行了毛泽东同志“要爱护朝鲜的一山一水，一草一木”的教诲。战斗结束后，村里的老百姓还没有回来，这些志愿军同志已经着手为村里的人们加固或重修被破坏的防空洞。有时，甚至在枪林弹雨之下，还耕好了地，种上了庄稼等人们回来。他们为了照顾刚回来的老百姓，宁愿饿着肚子，把自己的饭菜挨家挨户地分给老百姓。赵建元老人感激地对他们说：“剪下我的头发，给你们打鞋，也不能报答你们的恩情的万分之一呀！”这位六十多岁的老人，当天晚上不顾部队同志们的劝阻，往前线背了两趟军粮和弹药，来回走了三十多里。
    这种心情，并不是赵建元老人独有的。
    有一年涨大水，有一个二十二岁的人民军家属南仙妣，看到上前线的志愿军战士们脱了衣服过河，就动员了二十多名妇女自卫队员（当时青壮年都上前线，后方只留下妇女）组织支援志愿军的突击队，给他们架桥。敌人像冰一般地打过来的炮弹在爆炸，敌机在头上不断地盘旋轰炸和扫射。但是，妇女们为了在天黑以前架好桥梁，不顾一切危险，展开了紧张的架桥战斗。在这个工程中，南仙妣失去了弟弟，自己也被炸伤，昏过去了。同志们把她抬到志愿军医院。志愿军同志们看到她的一只胳膊被炸断，流血过多，有生命危险，都争着给她输血，使她渐渐恢复了知觉。此后，志愿军同志们每天都来慰问她，希望她早日养好伤。
    这样的血肉相关的深厚情谊，胜过了人间的一切崇高和美丽的事物。没有任何力量能够分开我们中朝人民的这种友谊。
    志愿军同志们把朝鲜人民的痛苦当作自己的痛苦，只要能帮助村里的人们，就不惜牺牲自己的一切。他们往往自己不吃午饭或者少吃，尽力节省出粮食来，给当时缺少粮食的居民。他们还给这个村庄盖好了民主宣传室和学校。当他们将要撤军的时候，还敲开冰河，跳进水里，建设了水库的大坝。村里的人们为了永远纪念他们，把它命名为“友谊坝”，在坝上立了纪念碑。
    “我们的生活刚要好起来，志愿军同志们就都回国啦。他们现在来看到我们欣欣向荣的生活，该多么高兴啊！”当我们访问南仙妣的时候，她向我们说。
    战前，这里一共有四百来户人家，但在战时只剩下二十四户人家。今天，这个村庄已盖好四百三十多户住宅，还有诊疗所、商店、幼儿园和十五所托儿所、九所民主宣传室以及澡堂等各种文化福利设施。村里的居民，在农业社中发挥了集体的创造力量，使农业产量早在大前年就超过了日本帝国主义统治时期的80％。志愿军同志们给他们建设的友谊坝，灌溉着占全部水田面积的25％的水田。村里的居民又自己建成了水库，把它命名为“报恩水库”，正在灌溉着五十多町步水田。其余的八十多町步旱田，也已经建立起了灌溉体系。
    “在用鲜血捍卫了的土地上，我们要建设美好的社会主义乐园！”村里的人们正在向着这一辉煌的目标迈进着。
      “你看，志愿军同志们给我盖这座房子时，我还没有什么东西摆在这两间屋里。可是现在，我已经有了收音机、缝纫机、挂钟、衣橱等家具”。南仙妣同志微笑着说，充满着对亲密朋友的无限怀念。在我们党所指引的合作化的道路上，他们亲手创造的生活越是幸福，就越是怀念最亲密的朋友。
    当我辞别南仙妣和她的丈夫走出来的时候，再次深情地仰望了一下挂在她家门上的写着“志愿军之家”的横匾。
    洋溢在这个村子里的朝中友谊，像传说一样将会永远为我们的子孙万代所传颂。
    朝中两国人民之间日益加深着的深厚友谊，同长流在我们两国国境上的鸭绿江和图们江一样，将永远在我们的心中畅流！
