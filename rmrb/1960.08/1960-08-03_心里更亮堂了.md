    I am a young farmer who has not been working for long, and also a literary enthusiast. Under the party's kind cultivation, I have written some short plays and short stories in recent years.

    I was troubled for a while with my writing. From 1956 to 1958, I mainly wrote scripts, writing quite a few one after another. However, the character of Old Man Zhang in the first script and Old Man Li in the second script, the third and fourth characters were all much the same. Not many of the scripts I wrote were staged. I wondered, and I thought, it must be because scripts are difficult to write, so I might as well change my career and write novels. Then I wrote novels for a year. Later, I asked for opinions from my comrades, and they all said, "The events you write about in your novels are not prominent, and the characters do not stand tall." I looked at it carefully, and I also felt that the tone was not heroic enough, and the colors were not vivid enough. I wondered even more, what is the reason for this? I thought, it must be because I haven't studied enough and haven't been writing for long enough, and I lack skills!

    In the past, I always thought that because I grew up in the countryside, I was more familiar with rural life. Therefore, when I discovered a new thing or a new person, I would get excited and start writing, but I didn't really get to know the characters, but only relied on a smattering of knowledge. How can I write works that truly reflect the image of the working class and are loved by and beneficial to the workers, peasants, and soldiers? Of course I can't.

    In fact, this is entirely because I have not reformed myself well. Young literary workers like me, who are from peasant backgrounds and have been cultivated in the new society, also need to constantly reform themselves and maintain long-term and close ties with the workers and peasants. But in the past, I had other ideas. Reforming my thinking is the business of old writers. I am a young man in my twenties, and I grew up in the countryside, so I don't need any ideological reform. Every short play and every short essay I write is about rural affairs and is for the farmers to see, so this is serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers! As long as I do this, I won't make mistakes. Such thinking is so dangerous! If it continues, I will surely become divorced from the masses, make serious mistakes, and follow the path of Liu Shaotang.

    Through studying, I felt like I had taken a refreshing medicine. I further clarified that serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers through literature and art is our only path. How can we serve them well? That is to be down-to-earth and become one with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, share their fate and breathe the same air, learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and establish deep feelings with them. At the same time, we must also strengthen political study, constantly reform our thinking, and establish a proletarian worldview, so that we can become people with a high degree of communist thought. Only in this way can we write about the new era and new heroic figures, and only then can we write works that the workers, peasants, and soldiers truly love. Moreover, we can not only write about today, but also write about tomorrow and write about our great ideals.

    心里更亮堂了	周西海
    我是刚参加工作不久的一个青年农民，也是一个文艺爱好者。在党的亲切培养下，几年来写了一些小戏和短篇小说。
    我在习作上，曾经苦恼过一段时期。从1956年开始到1958年，我主要是写剧本，接二连三写得不少。可是，第一个剧本的张老汉和第二个剧本的李老汉，第三个第四个人物性格都是大同小异。剧本写出来后，上演的也不多。我奇怪了，我想，这一定是剧本难写的原因，干脆改行，写小说。接着我就写了一年小说。后来我征求同志们的意见，同志们都说：“你的小说抓的事件不突出，人物站得不高。”我仔细看了看，也感到调子不够豪迈，色彩不够鲜明。我更奇怪了，这是啥原因呢？我想，这一定是自己喝墨水还少，写作时间还短，缺乏技巧吧！
    过去我总以为自己生长在农村，对农村生活比较熟悉。所以，发现一件新事，一个新人物，脑子一热，抓笔就写，而我并没有真正的去熟悉人物，只是凭一知半解。这样如何能够写出工农群众的真实形象并为工农兵所喜爱的有益于他们的作品呢？当然不能。
    其实这完全是因为我没有改造好。像我这样农民出身又在新社会中培养出来的青年文艺工作者，也完全需要不断进行改造，和工农群众保持长期的紧密的联系。而我过去却有另外的想法，改造思想嘛，那是老作家的事，我是个二十多岁的小青年，又是生长在农村，不需要什么思想改造。我写的每一个小戏，每一篇短文，写的都是农村的事，又是让农民看的，这就是为工农兵服务嘛！只要这样就不会犯错误。这样的想法是多么的危险呀，这样下去一定会脱离群众，犯严重的错误，走向刘绍棠的道路。
    通过学习，我像吃到了一付清凉剂，进一步明确了文艺为工农兵服务是我们唯一的道路。如何能服务得好呢？那就是踏踏实实的和工农兵打成一片，同命运共呼吸，向工农兵学习，和工农兵建立深厚的感情。同时还要加强政治学习，不断的改造思想，树立无产阶级世界观，使自己成为具有高度共产主义思想的人。只有这样，才能写出我们新的时代新的英雄人物，才能写出工农群众真正喜爱的作品。并且，不仅仅写出今天，而且能写出明天，写出我们的伟大理想。
