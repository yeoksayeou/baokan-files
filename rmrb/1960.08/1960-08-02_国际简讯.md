    American Intercontinental Missile Test Fails
    New York dispatch: The U.S. Air Force launched an "Atlas" intercontinental ballistic missile from Vandenberg Base on July 22, but the missile deviated from its trajectory shortly after launch, and ground controllers had to press a button to destroy it in the air.
    On the 28th, the U.S. Air Force again test-fired a "Titan" intercontinental missile at Cape Canaveral. It was boasted beforehand that it would fly over 8,000 kilometers, but it only flew 80 kilometers before plunging into the Atlantic due to the premature shutdown of the first-stage rocket engine.
