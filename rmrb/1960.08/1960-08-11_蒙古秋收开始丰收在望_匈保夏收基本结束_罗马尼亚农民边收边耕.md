Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, 9th August: The Mongolian newspaper "Unen" reported today that Mongolia is preparing to welcome a bumper harvest, and the autumn harvest has begun in some areas.

Mongolia's autumn harvest is earlier than in previous years. Due to the early rainy season this year, sowing was carried out in advance, and the climate is suitable, so most of the grains have matured quickly. The Korolen, Tsleteer, and Jilgrantu state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms, where grains have matured earlier, have already begun harvesting. State-owned agricultural and pastoral farms and agricultural and pastoral cooperatives that have not yet begun harvesting are also stepping up the overhaul of agricultural machinery in preparation for the bumper harvest.

This year, Mongolia's grain is growing well, and the sown area has been expanded compared to last year. More than 160,000 hectares of wasteland reclaimed last year have all been planted with grain this year. According to relevant sources, this year is expected to be a bumper year, with an estimated harvest of 12 million poods of grain, which will be one and a half times more than last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 10th August: Hungary's summer harvest this year has been faster and better than in any previous year. Currently, counties such as Somogy and Heves have completed harvesting, and harvesting in other areas will also be completed in the coming days.

The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party attaches great importance to this year's summer harvest. Party organizations at all levels conduct propaganda and mobilization work related to the summer harvest through newspapers, meetings, and home visits, and many party cadres also go deep into the fields to provide specific guidance.

The preliminary results of this year's summer harvest once again confirm the superiority of collective farming by farmers. The Dore Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nyíregyháza harvested an average of 22 quintals of winter barley per hold (approximately 8.55 mu), while in the past, when operating individually, the yield on the same land was less than 10 quintals per hold.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 10th August: Bulgaria's summer harvest crops—wheat, barley, rye, and oats—as well as fodder crops, have been basically harvested. As of July 28th, with the strong support of the vast number of workers, students, and officers and soldiers of the People's Army, members of agricultural cooperatives in the plains areas, with the exception of the colder mountainous and semi-mountainous areas, had completed harvesting on 90.2% of the wheat fields. Harvested fodder crops accounted for 92.1% of the total planting area.

This year's summer harvest crops, especially wheat, have achieved a bumper harvest. The average yield of wheat per decare (equivalent to 1.5 mu) this year is expected to reach 200 kilograms, which is about 27 kilograms more than the highest wheat yield year in Bulgarian history—1959.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 10th August: Romanian farmers have recently been working in shifts around the clock in many places, harvesting wheat during the day and deep plowing at night. According to their experience in recent years, timely deep plowing of the land in summer and applying basal fertilizer can guarantee a bumper harvest in the coming year.

Now that the wheat harvesting and threshing work is nearing its end, the vast number of agricultural laborers are vigorously shifting to deep plowing of the land and applying basal fertilizer. The depth of plowing in Romania this year is generally 28 to 30 centimeters.

Due to the timely deep plowing and other technical measures taken last year, state-owned farms in Bucharest, Galați, Ploiești and other counties have increased the average yield of wheat by 100 to 400 kilograms per hectare this year compared with the original plan.

### 蒙古秋收开始丰收在望  匈保夏收基本结束　罗马尼亚农民边收边耕

    蒙古秋收开始丰收在望
    匈保夏收基本结束　罗马尼亚农民边收边耕
    新华社乌兰巴托9日电　蒙古“真理报”今天报道，蒙古各地准备迎接丰收，一部分地区的秋收已经开始。
    蒙古今年的秋收比往年早，今年由于雨季早，提前播种，气候适宜，大部分谷物都已快成熟。目前谷物成熟得早的科尔伦、茨勒特尔、吉尔格郎图等国营农牧场都已开始进行收割。尚未开始收割的国营农牧场和农牧业合作社也都在加紧检修农业机器，准备迎接丰收。
    蒙古今年谷物生长良好，播种面积比去年扩大。去年开垦的十六万多公顷荒地，今年全部种上了谷物。据有关方面估计，今年是一个大丰收年，约可收获一千二百万普特粮食，将比去年增加到一倍半。
    新华社布达佩斯10日电　匈牙利今年的夏收比任何一年都进行得快，进行得好。目前绍莫吉·海威斯等州已经收割完毕，其他地区的收割工作也将在日内结束。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党对今年的夏收工作异常重视。各级党组织通过报刊、会议、家庭访问来进行有关夏收的宣传鼓动工作，有不少党的干部还深入田间进行具体领导。
    今年夏收的初步成绩又一次证实了农民集体经营的优越性。尼尔哈兹的多热农业生产合作社每霍尔特（约合八点五五市亩）平均收获二十二公担秋大麦，而过去个体经营时，在同样的土地上每霍尔特的收成不到十公担。
    新华社索非亚10日电　保加利亚今年的夏收作物——小麦、大麦、黑麦和燕麦以及饲料作物已基本收割完毕。截至7月28日为止，除较寒冷的山区和半山区外，平原地区的农业合作社社员在广大职工、学生和人民军官兵的大力支援下，已经在90.2％的麦田上完成了收割工作。已收割的饲料作物占全部种植面积的92.1％。
    今年的夏收作物，特别是小麦，获得了丰收。今年每一狄卡尔（合一市亩半）的小麦平均产量可望达到二百公斤，比保加利亚历史上小麦产量最高的年代——1959年还要多二十七公斤左右。
    新华社布加勒斯特10日电　罗马尼亚农民最近在很多地方分昼夜两班轮番工作，白天割麦，夜间深耕。根据他们近年的经验，及时在夏季深翻土地和施加底肥，就可以保证来年丰产。
    现在，小麦收打工作已接近尾声，广大农业劳动者正在大力转入深翻土地和施加底肥的工作。罗马尼亚今年翻地的深度一般达二十八至三十厘米。
    布加勒斯特、加拉齐、普罗什蒂等州的国营农场由于去年及时进行深翻和采取其它技术措施，今年小麦每公顷平均产量比原计划增产一百至四百公斤。
