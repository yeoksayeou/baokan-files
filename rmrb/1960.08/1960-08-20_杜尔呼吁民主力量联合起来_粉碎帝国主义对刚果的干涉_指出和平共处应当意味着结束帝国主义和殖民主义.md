Xinhua News Agency, Rome, August 19th. According to a report from TASS in Rome on the 17th, the Italian newspaper "Unità" published a speech by President Touré of the Republic of Guinea on the Congo situation and major political issues in Africa.

    Speaking about the Congo situation, Touré said, "The independence of the Congo is the result of the heroic struggle of the Congolese people, especially the Congolese working class. Therefore, the goal of this independence is the economic, social, and cultural transformation achieved in accordance with the interests of the Congolese people." He said, "The struggle in the Congo is no longer just a struggle between the Congolese nationalist movement and the imperialists and colonialists. It is a struggle for Africa to achieve complete independence and enjoy its freedom extensively, against those who still want to oppress and exploit it."

    Touré continued, "We understand that the conspiracy against the Congo was not only formulated by the Belgian reactionaries but also by other colonialist forces who are keen to maintain their oppression in Africa. The Belgian aggression is a manifestation of the general policy of all imperialists; it is they who created the threat to the young Republic of the Congo."

    Touré emphasized, "All democratic forces in the world, including all independent African countries, should unite their forces to crush the imperialists' vicious plans against the young Congolese nation."

    Touré also condemned the imperialist conspiracy against the independence and national sovereignty of the Republic of Guinea. He said, "There is not just one conspiracy against Guinea, but many, and we know that as long as we pursue a policy that safeguards the interests of the people, the various conspiracies will not stop." Touré said that the imperialists' attempts to isolate Guinea economically and diplomatically and make the Guinean people abandon their attempts at independence have failed. To this end, he praised the economic agreements signed by Guinea with socialist countries.

    Speaking about the issue of African people's unity, Touré said: This is "the unity of action of the African people in the struggle for the establishment of a pan-African system of freedom. It is this unity of action that most frightens the oppressors because they know that every time Africans gather together to discuss their political, economic, administrative, and cultural issues, they will immediately realize that colonialism and imperialism are the real enemies of their national independence and interests. Therefore, the slogan of African unity means the determination of the people of all African countries to oppose the exploiters and oppressors."

    President Touré said: "The advantage of the current African political situation is the understanding of the urgent need to solve the political problems of independence. Therefore, I would like to say that the struggle for national liberation is above all else."

    Touré also spoke about the peaceful coexistence between people of countries with different social systems. He said that the people of all African countries, especially the people of Guinea, have agreed with the principle of peaceful coexistence in the past and now. Touré went on to point out, "Peaceful coexistence should mean the end of imperialism and colonialism, because they hinder the just and fraternal cooperation between the people of all countries, harm their interests, and pose a threat to world peace."

    杜尔呼吁民主力量联合起来
    粉碎帝国主义对刚果的干涉
    指出和平共处应当意味着结束帝国主义和殖民主义
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社罗马17日讯：意大利“团结报”登载了几内亚共和国总统杜尔就刚果事件和非洲主要政治问题发表的谈话。
    在谈到刚果事件时，杜尔说，“刚果的独立是刚果人民，特别是刚果工人阶级英勇斗争的结果。因此，这一独立的目标是，在符合刚果人民利益的情况下所实现的经济、社会和文化的革新”。他说，“刚果的斗争已经不仅仅是刚果民族主义运动反对帝国主义者和殖民主义者的斗争。这是非洲希望取得完全独立和广泛享受自己的自由，反对那些仍然想压迫和剥削它的人的斗争。”
    杜尔接着说，“我们懂得，反对刚果的阴谋不仅是比利时反动派所制定的，而且也是其他热中于维护自己在非洲的压迫的殖民主义势力所制定的。比利时的侵略是所有帝国主义者总方针的表现；正是他们制造了对年青的刚果共和国的威胁。”
    杜尔强调指出，“世界上一切民主力量，其中包括非洲所有独立国家，应当联合自己的力量，粉碎帝国主义者反对年青的刚果国家的恶毒计划。”
    杜尔还谴责了帝国主义反对几内亚共和国的独立和民族主权的阴谋。他说，“反对几内亚的阴谋不止一个，而是有许多，我们知道，只要我们奉行维护人民利益的政策，各种阴谋就不会停止。”杜尔说，帝国主义者在经济和外交方面孤立几内亚，使几内亚人民放弃独立的企图失败了。为此，他赞扬了几内亚同社会主义国家所签订的经济协定。
    在谈到非洲人民统一的问题时，杜尔说：这是“非洲人民在争取建立全非自由制度斗争中的行动一致。正是这种行动一致最使压迫者害怕，因为压迫者知道，每一次非洲人聚集在一起讨论自己的政治、经济、行政和文化问题时，他们就会立即意识到，殖民主义和帝国主义——这是他们的民族独立和利益的真正的敌人。因此，非洲统一的口号意味着非洲各国人民反对剥削者和压迫者的决心。”
    杜尔总统说：“当前非洲政治局势的优点，是理解到迫切需要解决独立的政治问题。因此我想说，争取民族解放的斗争胜过一切。”
    杜尔还谈到不同社会制度的各国人民之间的和平共处问题。他说，非洲各国人民，特别是几内亚人民，过去和现在都赞同和平共处的原则。杜尔接着指出，“和平共处应当意味着结束帝国主义和殖民主义，因为它们妨碍着各国人民之间正当和兄弟般的合作，损害了他们的利益，给世界和平造成威胁。”
