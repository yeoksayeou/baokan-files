Thrifty Management, No Land Idle
Huijiang Production Team Achieves Consecutive Years of Increased Grain and Tangerine Production

The Huijiang Production Team of Chengjiang Commune in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, is a tangerine-producing area with little land and a large population, averaging only 0.8 mu of land per person, of which 0.43 mu is tangerine orchard and 0.37 mu is grain land. However, under the leadership of the Party branch, all cadres and members of the team have been thrifty in management, leaving no land idle, and have achieved consecutive years of increased grain and tangerine production, as well as an all-round leap forward in agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.

This team not only manages the grain fields well, such as achieving a multiple cropping index of 240% for paddy fields last year, but also fully utilizes the land in the tangerine orchards to expand operations and increase income. Tangerine trees require a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer, so they intercrop various leguminous crops on the tangerine mounds. In this way, the rhizobia of soybeans, mung beans, etc., provide a large amount of fertilizer for the tangerine trees, while the high and dry terrain of the tangerine orchards ensures a good harvest of beans, which are susceptible to waterlogging. They raise bees in the tangerine orchards. Bees can promote cross-pollination of citrus, resulting in high yields, and the tangerine blossom honey collected by the bees is also a high-quality honey with high nutritional value. In winter, they raise chickens, ducks, and geese in the tangerine orchards, which can remove various overwintering insect eggs in the tangerine orchards and improve the fertility of the tangerine orchards. The gaps in the team's fifty mu of small tangerine orchards are large, so they plant continuous cropping rice in the tangerine ditches. This not only supplies moisture to the tangerines and strengthens the cultivation of the tangerine trees but also increases grain production... This is how they try every means to use the tangerine orchards to increase production and income. In the past two years, the team has harvested more than 10,000 jin of rice and various beans from intercropping in the tangerine orchards, and more than 350,000 jin of various vegetables.

    勤俭经营　寸土不闲
    汇江生产队粮桔连年增产
    浙江省黄岩县澄江公社汇江生产队是个产桔区，地少人多，平均每人只有八分地，其中桔地四分三厘，粮地三分七厘。可是全队干部和社员，在党支部的领导下，勤俭经营，寸土不闲，争得了粮桔连年增产，农牧副渔全面跃进。
    这个队不但粮田经营得好，如：去年的水田复种指数达到240％，还充分利用了桔园的土地，扩大经营，增加收入。桔树需要大量的氮肥，他们就把各种豆科作物套种在桔墩上，这样，黄豆、绿豆等的根瘤菌为桔树提供了大量的肥料，而桔园地势高燥，又保证了怕涝的豆类的丰收。他们在桔园里养蜂，蜜蜂能够促进柑桔异花授粉，使柑桔高产，而蜜蜂采的桔花蜜，又是养分很高的优质蜜。冬天在桔园里养鸡、鸭、鹅，既能除去桔园里的各种越冬虫卵，又能提高桔园的肥力。全队五十亩小桔园的空隙大，他们就在桔沟里种上连作稻，这样，既供应了桔子的水分，加强了对桔树的培育，又增产了粮食……。他们就是这样，千方百计地利用桔园增加生产，增加收入。两年来，全队桔园套种收获的稻谷和各种豆类有一万多斤，各种蔬菜三十五万多斤。
