Xinhua News Agency, August 15th. Ambassador Li Yong-ho's speech at the reception celebrating the 15th anniversary of the Liberation of Korea:

    Respected Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Respected Chairman Zhu De, Respected Premier Zhou Enlai, Dear Comrades, Friends:
    Today, the Korean people are celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of August 15th Liberation, a national holiday commemorating our liberation from the yoke of Japanese imperialist colonial rule thanks to the great Soviet army.
    The liberation of Korea from the Japanese imperialist yoke marks the greatest turning point of development and change in the long history of the Korean people.
    Today, the Korean people are celebrating this day of national rebirth with immense pride as victors.
    Throughout the entire struggle for our new life, the Korean people have been advancing along the ever-victorious path of Marxism-Leninism under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung.
    The history of Korea over the past fifteen years is in reality the history of creative labor struggle to build a socialist paradise on liberated land, and the victorious history of the Korean people in striking down the imperialist aggressors led by the American imperialists.
    At present, our country has become a new type of nation that has eliminated all the backwardness of a colonial and semi-feudal society, and a socialist country without exploitation and poverty, where everyone helps each other and everyone is happy.
    The imperialists, led by the American imperialists, once arrogantly said that it would be no easy task for our people to rise from the ruins of war damage! That's what they hoped for.
    However, the Korean people, having won victory in the struggle against American imperialism, have, under the correct leadership of our Party, gloriously completed the task of restoring and developing the post-war people's economy, continued to advance the revolutionary upsurge, and achieved unprecedented great victories and accomplishments in all areas of socialist construction.
    Our people have completed their first five-year plan in history two and a half years ahead of schedule, and have overfulfilled the people's economic plan for the first half of 1960 by 7%, which is of great significance for the realization of the buffer period task.
    Our country has completely eliminated the colonial deformity in industry and laid a solid foundation for socialist industrialization.
    Tremendous changes have also taken place in agriculture. The rural areas of our country, which have completed socialist cooperation, have basically realized water conservancy and electrification. The mechanization of rural areas is also progressing rapidly.
    On the basis of the rapid development of the people's economy, the material and cultural living standards of the people have also been rapidly improved.
    Our cities and villages, which had been reduced to ruins in the war, have been rebuilt more beautifully and stand tall with a new look.
    Our country, which was once a backward colonial agricultural country, has now become a socialist industrial-agricultural country with a solid national self-reliant economic foundation.
    The reason we have been able to achieve these achievements is because of our Party's policy - the policy of creatively applying the Marxist-Leninist theory of socialist revolution and socialist construction to the specific practice of our country, and because of the creative struggle of the Korean people, united around the Party like steel.
    All these victories and achievements achieved by the Korean people in their lofty struggle are inseparable from the fraternal and selfless assistance of the great Soviet people, and the valuable assistance of the Chinese people and the people of other socialist countries.
    Based on the achievements already made, the Korean people will soon begin implementing the Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the People's Economy from 1961 in order to achieve a decisive victory in the socialist construction of our country.
    Today, on the eve of starting to realize this grand task, the Korean people, in accordance with the spirit of the August Plenary Session of our Party Central Committee held not long ago, are launching a vigorous labor struggle in order to carry out great technological innovations in all departments of the people's economy, giving full play to their soaring enthusiasm, and advancing bravely.
    The tremendous achievements of socialist construction in the northern half of our country have become a powerful force encouraging the people of South Korea to fight against the colonial rule of American imperialism, and are shining brightly on their path forward.
    Due to the struggle of the South Korean people against the fascist rule, Syngman Rhee, the running dog of American imperialism, has been driven off the stage, and the foundation of American imperialist colonial rule has been completely shattered.
    Through their own struggles, the South Korean people have further strengthened their confidence that no matter how the American imperialists and their running dogs suppress and struggle, as long as the people are aware, united, and fighting, they can win victory.
    The mass uprisings of the South Korean people, which have recently erupted like volcanoes in all regions of South Korea, are an explosion of the mountains of anger accumulated by the South Korean people over fifteen years of American imperialist and Syngman Rhee bandit gang fascist colonial rule, and are their just and patriotic struggle to win the right to survival.
    The South Korean economy has been completely bankrupt, and the total value of industrial production has been reduced to half of what it was during the Japanese occupation. In particular, the production of many important industries is almost non-existent.
    The total grain output in South Korea, which is known as the granary of Korea, has been reduced by 40% compared to the Japanese occupation period, and now it has to import millions of bushels of grain every year.
    Currently, more than half of the residents of South Korea with labor power are unemployed or semi-unemployed, and they and more than three million farmers who have run out of food are struggling on the brink of starvation.
    The South Korean people do not even have the most basic democratic rights and freedoms.
    The people in the southern half of the country have found this intolerable and have finally launched a heroic struggle against the enemy who has imposed misfortune and suffering on them.
    However, the root cause of the misfortune of the South Korean people - the anti-people rule of American imperialism and its puppet group - has not been eradicated, and the enemy is frantically suppressing and deceiving the people who have launched the struggle.
    In order to continue to maintain its fascist colonial rule over South Korea, American imperialism has recently been staging the ugly farce of "elections," allowing the upper echelons of the "Democratic Party" to replace Syngman Rhee's "Liberal Party" and take the stage as rulers of the puppet government, in order to once again realize Syngman Rhee-style rule.
    However, no insidious trick of American imperialism can prolong the rotten, tottering colonial rule system, or clean up the fragmented situation in South Korea today.
    Even at this very moment, the South Korean people are still continuing to wage fierce struggles, demanding a new life and new politics.
    Today, the American imperialist aggressors are encountering fierce resistance from the people in South Korea and in all the places where they have a foothold. Its policy of aggression has been thoroughly bankrupt.
    However, the imperialists, led by American imperialism, are further engaging in shameless conspiracies, attempting to find a way out of the crisis they face through a frantic arms race and the aggravation of international tensions.
    American imperialism has consistently violated the Korean Armistice Agreement in South Korea, illegally transporting atomic and rocket weapons into South Korea, throwing large numbers of American imperialist mercenaries into South Korea, and frantically conducting atomic war exercises near the military demarcation line.
    American imperialism is building military bases everywhere in the world against socialist camp countries, continuing to expand armaments, reviving West German revanchism and Japanese militarism, and engaging in military conspiracies around the world.
    The American imperialist aggressors destroyed the Four-Power Summit by the robber-style violation of Soviet airspace; since then, they have continued to engage in various provocative activities, such as continuing to send reconnaissance planes to invade the Soviet Union, and sabotaging the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference.
    Not only that, but American imperialism has also blatantly interfered in the internal affairs of Cuba and the Congo, seriously threatening the freedom and independence of the people of these countries.
    The Korean people have always maintained a high degree of vigilance against these instigations by American imperialism.
    Today, the only way to consolidate peace in Korea, clean up the wreckage in South Korea, and peacefully resolve the Korean issue is to force the American imperialist aggressor troops to withdraw from South Korea, and for the Korean people themselves to resolve the Korean issue through North-South consultation and North-South general elections.
    In order to implement this, the Korean people have consistently made and are making efforts.
    At this celebration of the 15th anniversary of August 15th Liberation, Comrade Kim Il-sung once again put forward a plan for the peaceful reunification of the motherland: if the political parties and social organizations of South Korea do not accept our proposal for holding North-South general elections without external interference, then in order to solve the current urgent problems of the nation, transitional measures can be taken, that is, the existing political systems of the North and South will be retained as they are, and under the condition of maintaining the independent activities of the North and South governments, a North-South Korean federal system will be implemented to promote mutual understanding between the North and South and to conduct and handle extensive exchanges in economy, culture, etc. It is also suggested that if the South Korean authorities do not even accept this, then the representatives of the North and South business circles should form a North-South Joint Economic Committee to conduct extensive economic exchanges between the North and South, and at the same time exchange North-South cultural representatives to conduct extensive cultural exchanges. In addition, in order to improve relations between the North and South and restore the bankrupt South Korean economy to normal, the armies of North and South Korea should be reduced to 100,000 or less.
    These plans are the unanimous demands of all the Korean people.
    The Korean issue must be resolved by the Korean people themselves.
    We have not forgotten for a moment that American imperialism, the mastermind of the world's reactionaries, is doing everything possible to obstruct the great cause of peaceful reunification of the Korean people.
    As long as American imperialism still occupies South Korea, the Korean people will not stop their struggle against it and will fight to the end until final victory is achieved.
    American imperialism must get out of South Korea, must get out of Taiwan and South Vietnam!
    The Korean people will never give up until they realize the great revolutionary cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland!
    The forces of socialism and peace, which far exceed the strength of the imperialist camp, are firmly supporting the Korean people.
    In the struggle for the great cause of socialism and peace, the Korean people will further strengthen their unity with the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people of all socialist camp countries, steadfastly defend the eastern outpost of peace and socialism, and further strengthen friendship and unity with the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all peace-loving people of the world.
    Comrades and friends!
    The friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China are forged in blood, and have been tested and consolidated through arduous struggles and training.
    In the difficult period of the Korean people's struggle against American imperialist aggression, the Chinese people sent volunteers to aid us with blood; in the period of post-war recovery and construction of our country, they gave great economic assistance; and at present, they continue to give great assistance to our socialist construction.
    I would like to take this opportunity to once again express my heartfelt gratitude to the fraternal Chinese people.
    The further development of this friendly cooperative relationship between the two countries will further promote the high tide of socialist construction, and will make a significant contribution to the unity of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the great cause of peace.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the 650 million fraternal Chinese people have already made tremendous achievements in the great leap forward of socialist construction.
    The Korean people are as happy about the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the great leap forward of socialist construction as they are about their own achievements.
    On this day of profound significance for the Korean people, let me, in the name of the Korean people, wish the fraternal Chinese people, who continue to leap forward along the general line put forward by the Chinese Communist Party, even greater victories.
    Finally, I propose:
    For the unbreakable friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China,
    For the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people,
    For the health of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China,
    For the invincible friendship and unity of the people of all countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
    For the peace and friendship of all countries,
    Cheers!

    在庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年的招待会上
    李永镐大使的讲话
    新华社15日讯　李永镐大使在庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年招待会上的讲话。尊敬的刘少奇主席同志，尊敬的朱德委员长同志，尊敬的周恩来总理同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    今天，朝鲜人民庆祝自己依靠伟大苏联军队从日本帝国主义殖民统治枷锁下获得解放的全民节日——八·一五解放十五周年。
    朝鲜从日本帝国主义枷锁下获得解放，是朝鲜人民悠久历史上从未有过的发展和变革的最大转折点。
    今天，朝鲜人民怀着胜利者的巨大骄矜，欢度这个民族再生的节日。
    在为自己的新生活而进行的整个斗争过程中，朝鲜人民一直在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党领导下，沿着百战百胜的马克思列宁主义的道路前进。
    十五年来的朝鲜历史，实际上就是在解放了的土地上为建设社会主义乐园而进行的创造性劳动斗争的历史，是朝鲜人民打击以美帝国主义为元凶的帝国主义侵略者的胜利的历史。
    目前，我国已经变成一个消除了殖民地半封建社会一切落后状态的新型国家，变成一个没有剥削和贫穷、人人互助人人幸福的社会主义国家。
    以美帝国主义为元凶的帝国主义者们，曾经狂妄地说我国人民要在遭到战争破坏的废墟上站起来，谈何容易！他们就是这样希望的。
    然而，在同美帝国主义的斗争中获得胜利的我国人民，在我们党的正确领导下，光荣地完成了恢复和发展战后人民经济的任务，继续推进革命高潮，并在建设社会主义的一切领域里，取得了史无前例的伟大胜利和成就。
    我国人民已经提前两年半完成了自己历史上的第一个五年计划，并且超额7％完成了对于实现缓冲期任务具有重大意义的1960年上半年人民经济计划。
    我国已经完全清除了工业上的殖民地畸形性，奠定了稳固的社会主义工业化基础。
    农业方面也发生了巨大的变化。完成了社会主义合作化的我国农村，已经基本上实现了水利化和电气化。农村的机械化也在迅速进展。
    在人民经济飞速发展的基础上，人民的物质文化生活水平也得到了迅速的提高。
    我国在战争中变成废墟的城市和农村，已经建设得更加美丽，以崭新的姿态耸立起来。
    我国过去曾经是一个落后的殖民地农业国，如今已经变成一个具有稳固的民族自立经济基础的社会主义工业—农业国家。
    我们之所以能够取得这些成就，是因为有我们党的政策——把马克思列宁主义关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的理论创造性地运用于我国具体实践的政策，是因为有钢铁一般团结在党的周围的朝鲜人民的创造性斗争。
    朝鲜人民在自己崇高的斗争中所取得的这一切胜利和成就，又是同伟大苏联人民兄弟般的无私援助，同中国人民和其它社会主义国家人民的宝贵援助分不开的。
    朝鲜人民，基于已经获得的成就，即将从1961年起开始执行发展人民经济七年计划，以取得我国社会主义建设的决定性胜利。
    今天，在开始实现这一宏伟任务的前夕，朝鲜人民根据不久以前召开的我党中央委员会八月全会的精神，为了在人民经济各个部门大搞技术革新，正展开热火朝天的劳动斗争，发挥冲天干劲，奋勇前进。
    我国北半部社会主义建设的巨大成就，业已成为鼓舞南朝鲜人民进行反对美帝国主义殖民地统治斗争的强大力量，辉煌地照耀着他们的前进道路。
    由于南朝鲜人民反对法西斯统治的斗争，美帝国主义的走狗李承晚已经被赶下台来，美帝国主义的殖民统治基础也被彻底粉碎。
    南朝鲜人民通过自己的斗争，进一步坚定了这样的信心：不管美帝国主义及其走狗怎样镇压，怎样挣扎，只要人民觉悟起来，团结、斗争，就能够胜利。
    最近在南朝鲜所有地区火山一般爆发的南朝鲜人民的群众性起义，是南朝鲜人民十五年来对美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮法西斯殖民统治堆积如山的愤怒的爆发，是他们争取生存权利的正义斗争和爱国斗争。
    南朝鲜的经济已经彻底破产，工业生产总值已经降低到日寇统治时期的一半。特别是许多重要工业的生产，几乎一无所有。
    号称朝鲜谷仓的南朝鲜，粮食总产量已经比日寇统治时期减少了40％，现在每年不得不进口几百万石粮食。
    目前，南朝鲜有劳动力的居民当中，一半以上是失业者和半失业者，他们和三百万以上的断粮农民，挣扎在饥饿线上。
    南朝鲜人民连最起码的民主权利和自由都没有。
    对此，南半部人民忍无可忍，终于英勇地展开斗争，反对把不幸和痛苦强加在自己头上的敌人。
    可是，南朝鲜人民不幸的祸根——美帝国主义及其傀儡集团的反人民统治，还没有铲除，敌人正在疯狂地镇压和欺骗掀起斗争的人民。
    美帝国主义为了继续维持它对南朝鲜的法西斯殖民统治，最近正在通过它所导演的“选举”丑剧，让“民主党”上层集团代替李承晚的“自由党”上台做傀儡政府的执政者，以便再次实现李承晚式的统治。
    然而，美帝国主义的任何阴险花招，也决延长不了腐朽透顶摇摇欲坠的殖民地统治制度，收拾不了今天南朝鲜支离破碎的局面。
    就是现在这个时刻，南朝鲜人民仍在继续进行激烈的斗争，要求新生活和新政治。
    今天，美帝国主义侵略者在南朝鲜，在它所插足的一切地方，都遭到人民强烈的反抗。它的侵略政策，已经彻底破产。
    但是，以美帝国主义为元凶的帝国主义者们，却在进一步无耻地进行阴谋活动，企图从疯狂的军备竞赛和加剧国际紧张局势方面为它所面临的危机寻找出路。
    美帝国主义在南朝鲜一贯违反朝鲜停战协定，把原子和火箭武器非法运进南朝鲜，把美帝国主义雇佣兵大批投入南朝鲜，在军事分界线附近疯狂地进行原子战争演习。
    美帝国主义在全世界到处建立反对社会主义阵营国家的军事基地，继续扩充军备，复活西德复仇主义和日本军国主义，在世界各地搞军事阴谋。
    美帝国主义侵略者通过对苏联领空的强盗式侵犯，破坏了四国首脑会议；此后，仍然进行种种挑衅活动，如继续派遣侦察飞机侵入苏联，破坏十国裁军会议等等。
    不仅如此，美帝国主义还露骨地干涉古巴和刚果的内政，严重地威胁着这些国家人民的自由和独立。
    对于美帝国主义的这些策动，朝鲜人民一向保持高度的警惕。
    今天，巩固朝鲜的和平、收拾南朝鲜残破局面和和平解决朝鲜问题的途径，只有迫使美帝国主义侵略军队撤出南朝鲜，由朝鲜人自己通过南北协商和南北普选解决朝鲜问题。
    为了贯彻这一点，朝鲜人民始终不渝地做了并且正在做着努力。
    在这次庆祝八·一五解放十五周年大会上，金日成同志再一次提出了和平统一祖国的方案：如果南朝鲜各政党和社会团体不接受我们关于不受外部干涉举行南北普选的建议，那么为了解决民族当前的紧迫问题，可以采取这样的过渡措施，即原封不动地保留南北现存的政治制度，在保持南北政府独立活动的条件下，实行南北朝鲜联邦制，促进南北之间的相互了解，进行并处理经济和文化等的广泛交流。又建议：如果南朝鲜当局连这也不接受，那么就由南北实业界的代表组成南北联合经济委员会，进行南北之间广泛的经济交流，同时交换南北文化代表，进行广泛的文化交流。此外，为了改善南北之间的关系和使业已破产的南朝鲜经济恢复正常，把南北朝鲜的军队各裁减到十万人或十万人以下。
    这些方案，是全体朝鲜人民的一致主张。
    朝鲜问题，必须由朝鲜人自己解决。
    我们一时一刻也没有忘记，世界反动派的元凶美帝国主义，正在千方百计地阻挠朝鲜人民和平统一的伟大事业。
    只要美帝国主义还霸占着南朝鲜，朝鲜人民就不会停止反对它的斗争，并将战斗到底，直到取得最后胜利。
    美帝国主义必须滚出南朝鲜，必须滚出台湾和南越！
    朝鲜人民不实现和平统一祖国这一伟大革命事业，决不罢休！
    大大超过帝国主义阵营力量的社会主义和和平力量，正在坚定地支持着朝鲜人民。
    在为社会主义伟大事业和和平的斗争中，朝鲜人民将进一步加强同伟大苏联、中华人民共和国以及社会主义阵营各国人民的团结，坚定不移地保卫和平与社会主义的东方前哨，进一步加强同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界一切爱好和平人民的友谊与团结。
    同志们和朋友们！
    朝中两国人民之间的友谊和团结，是用鲜血结成的，并且是通过艰苦的斗争和锻炼而得到考验和巩固的。
    在朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略的艰苦时期，中国人民派遣志愿军用鲜血援助了我们；在我国人民战后恢复建设时期，又给予了巨大的经济援助；目前，则继续给予我国的社会主义建设以莫大的援助。
    我借此机会，向兄弟的中国人民再一次表示衷心的感谢。
    两国之间的这种友好合作关系的进一步发展，将会进一步促进社会主义建设的高涨，将会对以苏联为首的伟大社会主义阵营的团结和伟大的和平事业，作出重大的贡献。
    六亿五千万兄弟的中国人民，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，已经在社会主义建设大跃进中取得了巨大的成就。
    对于中国人民在社会主义建设大跃进中取得的巨大成就，朝鲜人民像对待自己的成就一样感到高兴。
    在朝鲜人民具有深刻意义的这个节日里，让我以朝鲜人民的名义，祝愿一直沿着中国共产党提出的总路线而继续大跃进的兄弟的中国人民，获得更大的胜利。
    最后，我提议：
    为朝中两国人民牢不可破的友谊和团结，
    为中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的健康，
    为中华人民共和国主席刘少奇同志的健康，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民不可战胜的友谊和团结，
    为各国人民的和平、友好，
    干杯！
