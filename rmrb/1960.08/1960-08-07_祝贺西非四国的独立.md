    Congratulating the Independence of Four West African Countries

    This year, on the vast land of West Africa, the flags of independent countries are being raised one after another. Following Togo and the Mali Federation, French West Africa's Dahomey, Niger, Upper Volta, and Ivory Coast also successively declared independence on August 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th. The people of the four French West African countries, who have long been under imperialist rule and oppression, have finally embarked on the path of independent development. The Chinese people, together with the African people, wholeheartedly congratulate the birth of these new independent African countries. Premier Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country have respectively sent telegrams to the leaders of these countries, deciding to recognize the Republics of Dahomey, Niger, Upper Volta, and Ivory Coast, and wishing the people of these countries further achievements in the struggle to safeguard national independence and oppose imperialism and colonialism.

    Western colonialists have always called Africans "ignorant" and "backward," and therefore in need of "Western civilization" to "enlighten" them. A century ago, the "civilizing envoys" of France used fire and sword to spread "Western civilization" to West Africa. However, the facts that occurred in West Africa over the past century completely exposed the hypocrisy of those "Western civilizations." In West Africa, it is well known that Africans had a relatively developed culture before the French colonialists invaded. As early as the 10th to 17th centuries, Africans had established unified kingdoms such as Bornu, Mali, and Dahomey, and it was only the invasion of the French colonialists that caused the disintegration of these kingdoms. For more than a hundred years, under the rule of French colonialists wearing the mask of so-called "civilizing envoys," the illiteracy rate among the people of French West Africa was over 90%. In Upper Volta, with a population of over three million, there were one hundred thousand leprosy patients. Niger, with a population of two million four hundred thousand, had only seven doctors in the entire country. This is the "achievement" of Western colonialists in "enlightening" African colonies. French colonialists also have a fallacy called the theory that French Black African colonies "exploit" the mainland of the suzerain state. This is truly unique! But unfortunately, this strange theory of colonies "exploiting" the suzerain state, apart from being able to deceive idiots, cannot fool anyone. Everyone knows that French colonialists seized a large amount of fertile land in West Africa, wantonly plundering West Africa's rich mineral and agricultural raw materials. The total value of agricultural raw materials imported by France from Black African colonies each year is about 160 billion francs or more. Every year, French colonial companies extract pure profits of up to 80 billion francs merely through monopoly trade. And the West African people who "exploit" France live lives worse than cattle and horses. The West African people can of course see through their own personal experiences that only by completely breaking free from the shackles of colonialism and achieving true national independence can the culture and economy of West African countries be fully developed.

    For a long time, the people of French West Africa have waged a heroic and unyielding struggle to win national independence and freedom. Although French colonialists invaded the coastal areas of West Africa more than three hundred years ago, due to the heroic resistance of the West African people, the colonialists were unable to penetrate the interior of West Africa for as long as two hundred years. West African tribal leaders Omar and Samori, among others, once led the vast West African people to launch tenacious battles against the well-equipped French colonial army, lasting for several years, giving the colonialists a heavy blow. Thereafter, although French colonialists occupied the entire West Africa by force, the armed resistance movements launched by the various ethnic groups in West Africa rose one after another and continued unabated. In recent years, especially after the 1955 Bandung Conference and the 1958 First All-African People's Conference, the national independence movement in French West Africa has developed anew. The working class, standing at the forefront of the struggle, has continuously launched large-scale strikes and demonstrations and other mass struggles. In early 1958, under the leadership of the General Union of Black African Workers, workers in all French West African countries held a general strike to protest the French colonial companies' unwarranted dismissal of plantation workers in Dahomey. The will of the people of French West Africa to achieve independence is unshakeable. The declaration of independence by the four French West African countries today is entirely the result of the long-term bloodshed, sacrifice, and arduous struggle of the people of these countries.

    For a long time, the artificial barriers created by imperialism and colonialism have prevented friendly exchanges between the Chinese people and the people of West African countries. In recent years in particular, after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republics of Guinea in West Africa, friendly exchanges between the Chinese people and the West African people have been increasing. The Chinese people are concerned about the struggle of the people of African countries against imperialism and colonialism, and are happy for every progress made by the people of African countries in the struggle for and maintenance of national independence. We believe that with the independence of the Four French West African countries, the friendly relations between the Chinese people and the West African people will be further developed.

### 祝贺西非四国的独立

    祝贺西非四国的独立
    今年，在非洲西部辽阔的土地上，独立国家的旗帜一面接着一面升起。继多哥和马里联邦之后，法属西非的达荷美、尼日尔、上沃尔特和象牙海岸，也在8月1日、3日、5日和7日，相继宣布独立。长期在帝国主义统治和压迫下的法属西非四国人民，终于走上了独立发展的道路。中国人民和非洲人民一道，衷心地祝贺这些非洲新的独立国家的诞生。我国总理周恩来和外交部长陈毅已分别致电这些国家的领导人，决定承认达荷美共和国、尼日尔共和国、上沃尔特共和国和象牙海岸共和国，并祝这些国家的人民在维护民族独立、反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中取得进一步的成就。
    西方殖民者一向把非洲人称为“愚昧”、“落后”民族，因而是需要“西方文明”去“开化”的。一个世纪以前，法兰西的“文明使者”就是使用了火和剑向西非去传播“西方文明”的。然而，一个世纪在西非发生的事实完全揭露了那些“西方文明”的虚伪性。在西非，大家知道，倒是在法国殖民者侵入以前，非洲人有过当时相当发达的文化。早在公元十至十七世纪，非洲人就建立了博尔努、马里、达荷美等统一的王国，只是由于法国殖民者的入侵，才造成这些王国的解体。一百多年来，在戴着所谓“文明使者”的面具的法国殖民者的统治下，法属西非人民的文盲占90％以上。上沃尔特三百多万人口中就有十万痳疯病患者。拥有二百四十万人口的尼日尔，全国只有七名医生。这就是西方殖民者“开化”非洲殖民地的“功绩”。法国殖民者还有一种谬论，叫做法属黑非洲殖民地“剥削”宗主国本土论。这真是别出心裁！但可惜这种殖民地“剥削”宗主国的怪论，除了能够欺骗白痴以外，是哄骗不了任何人的。谁都知道，法国殖民者在西非霸占了大量肥沃的土地，恣意掠夺西非富饶的矿产和农业原料。法国每年从黑非洲殖民地进口农业原料总值约在一千六百亿法郎以上。每年仅仅通过垄断贸易，法国殖民公司就榨取纯利高达八百亿法郎。而“剥削”法国的西非人民却过着牛马不如的生活。西非人民通过自己的切身体验当然能够看清，只有彻底挣脱殖民主义的枷锁，实现真正的民族独立，才有可能使西非各国的文化和经济得到充分的发展。
    为了争取民族独立和自由，法属西非人民长期以来进行了英勇不屈的斗争。尽管法国殖民者在三百多年以前即已侵入西非的沿海一带，由于西非人民的英勇抵抗，殖民主义者在长达二百年的时间内一直无法渗入西非的内地。西非的部落领袖奥马尔和萨马里等人，曾经率领广大的西非人民，同装备精良的法国殖民军队展开顽强的战斗，历时数年，给予殖民主义者以沉重的打击。此后，尽管法国殖民者凭持武力占领了整个西非，西非各族人民掀起的武装反抗运动仍是此伏彼起，连绵不断。最近几年来，特别是1955年万隆会议和1958年第一届全非人民大会以后，法属西非的民族独立运动又有了新的发展。站在斗争最前列的工人阶级，接连不断地掀起大规模的罢工和示威游行等群众性斗争。1958年初，在黑非洲工人总联合会的领导下，法属西非所有国家的工人都举行了总罢工，以抗议法国殖民公司无理解雇达荷美的种植园工人。法属西非人民要求实现独立的意志，是不可动摇的。法属西非四国今天的宣告独立，完全是由于这些国家的人民长期以来流血牺牲、艰苦奋斗的结果。
    长时期来，帝国主义和殖民主义所制造的人为的阻隔，使中国人民和西非各国人民不能进行友好往来。近些年间，特别是在中华人民共和国和西非的几内亚共和国建立了外交关系之后，中国人民和西非人民之间的友好往来日益增多。中国人民关切地注视着非洲各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争，并且为非洲各国人民在争取和维护民族独立的斗争中所获得的每一项进展而感到高兴。我们相信，随着法属西非四国的获得独立，中国人民和西非人民之间的友好关系必将得到进一步的发展。
