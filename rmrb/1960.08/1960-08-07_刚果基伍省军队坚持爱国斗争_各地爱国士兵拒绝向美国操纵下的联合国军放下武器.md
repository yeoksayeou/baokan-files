　　Congo's Kivu Province Army Persists in Patriotic Struggle
　　Patriotic Soldiers in Various Regions Refuse to Lay Down Arms to UN Forces Manipulated by the United States

　　(Comprehensive report by this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Congolese army in Congo's Kivu Province resolutely refuses to lay down its arms and continues its struggle against colonialism and to defend the independence of the motherland.

　　In Bukavu, the capital of the province, approximately 300 Congolese patriotic soldiers have refused to lay down their arms to the United Nations forces manipulated by the United States. Bukavu has been occupied by 200 troops of the United Nations forces. Reports indicate that the commander of the United Nations forces is there attempting to induce these Congolese soldiers to lay down their arms. While occupying Bukavu, the United Nations forces also dispatched another unit to seize Kindu in Kivu Province.

　　In Lumangabo, north of Bukavu, a 1,200-strong Congolese garrison resolutely refused to lay down its arms to the United Nations forces dispatched by the American Bunch and warned the United Nations forces not to take further action to disarm Congolese soldiers.

　　It is reported that the road between Bukavu and Goma to the north is still controlled by the Congolese army. These troops are still persisting in the anti-colonialist struggle.

　　According to a France-Presse report, in Butembo, a city at the northern tip of Kivu Province, a United Nations force attempted to forcibly disarm the Congolese garrison there, which angered the Congolese patriotic soldiers. They disarmed the United Nations force and detained them for several hours.

　　It is reported that some ministers in the Congolese government are increasingly dissatisfied with the United Nations forces' protection of the Belgian invading army. According to a United Press International report, some Congolese ministers have urged Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga to demand the withdrawal of United Nations forces from the Congo and to call on African countries to provide assistance to the Congo.

　　To protest Belgium's armed aggression against the Congo, the Congolese cabinet decided at a cabinet meeting on the morning of August 4th to demand that the Belgian ambassador, Vanden Bossche, leave Congolese territory on the 8th. This Belgian ambassador, despite the Congolese government's earlier announcement of the severance of diplomatic relations between the Congo and Belgium, continued to conduct activities in the Congo. On the same day, the Congolese cabinet also ordered all Congolese receiving technical training in Belgium to return home.

　　On the same day, Congolese radio broadcast a condemnation of colonialism. The radio said that friendship with colonialism is hypocritical, and the relationship between the suzerain state and its former colony is "enslavement."

　　United Nations Under-Secretary-General, the American Bunch, who commands the United Nations forces in the Congo, arrived by plane in Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province, on the 4th to carry out activities. Upon arrival, Bunch immediately held talks with Tshombe, the governor of Katanga Province, who had declared Katanga Province "independent" and is an agent of foreign monopoly capital. It is reported that a group of Congolese youth in Elisabethville held a demonstration near the road where Bunch was passing on the 4th, protesting the American's activities in the Congo.

    刚果基伍省军队坚持爱国斗争
    各地爱国士兵拒绝向美国操纵下的联合国军放下武器
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：刚果基伍省的刚果军队坚决拒绝放下武器，继续进行反对殖民主义、保卫祖国独立的斗争。
    在这个省的省会布卡武，约三百名刚果爱国士兵拒绝向美国操纵下的联合国军放下武器。布卡武已被联合国军的二百名部队所占领。消息说，联合国部队司令正在那里诱迫这些刚果士兵放下武器。在侵占布卡武的同时，联合国军还派遣另一支部队去夺取基伍省的金杜。
    在布卡武以北的卢曼加博，一支一千二百人的刚果驻防部队坚决拒绝向美国人本奇派去的联合国军部队放下武器，并且警告联合国军队不要采取解除刚果士兵武装的进一步行动。
    据报道，在布卡武同以北的果马之间的公路，仍然控制在刚果军队的手中。这些军队仍在坚持反殖民主义斗争。
    另据法新社的消息说，在基伍省北端的布汤坡城，一支联合国部队企图强行缴除那里刚果守军的武装，这激怒了刚果爱国士兵。他们解除了那支联合国部队的武装，并且把这批人拘留了几小时。
    据报道，刚果政府的某些部长对联合国军包庇比利时侵略军愈来愈表示不满。合众国际社消息说，一些刚果部长曾敦促副总理基赞加要求联合国军撤出刚果，并呼吁非洲国家给予刚果援助。
    为了抗议比利时武装侵略刚果，刚果内阁4日上午在一次内阁会议上，决定要求比利时大使范登博斯什在8日离开刚果领土。这个比利时大使，不顾刚果政府早些日子宣布刚果断绝同比利时的外交关系，仍然继续在刚果进行活动。刚果内阁在同一天还命令所有在比利时受技术训练的刚果人回国。
    同一天，刚果电台发表广播，谴责殖民主义。电台说，同殖民主义友好是虚伪的，宗主国和它的前殖民地之间的关系是“奴役”。
    联合国副秘书长、指挥在刚果的联合国军的美国人本奇4日乘飞机到达刚果加丹加省省会伊利沙伯维尔进行活动。本奇在到达后立即同曾经宣布加丹加省“独立”的加丹加省省长、外国垄断资本代理人冲伯举行会谈。据报道，伊利沙伯维尔的一批刚果青年4日在本奇应经的道路附近举行示威，抗议这个美国人到刚果活动。
