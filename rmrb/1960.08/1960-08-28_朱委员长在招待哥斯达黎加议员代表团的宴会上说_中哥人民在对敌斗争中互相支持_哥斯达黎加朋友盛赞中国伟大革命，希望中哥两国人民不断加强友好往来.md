Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: Chairman Zhu De held a banquet tonight to entertain the Costa Rican Parliamentary Delegation currently visiting our country.

Vice Chairmen Guo Moruo and Lin Feng also attended the banquet.

Chairman Zhu De spoke at the banquet, first expressing a warm welcome on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Chinese people.

He pointed out: The fact that you friends have overcome the pressure and threats of U.S. imperialism to come to our country fully demonstrates the sincere desire of the Costa Rican people to develop friendly relations with the Chinese people. The common desire of the two peoples for friendship cannot be stopped by any imperialism. We hope that more Costa Rican friends will come to visit our country, following in your footsteps.

Chairman Zhu De said: U.S. imperialism is using the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the American States, using the guise of "Pan-Americanism," to coerce Latin American countries, attempting to strangle Cuba's independence and further enslave Latin American countries. At the same time, U.S. imperialism is also occupying our country's territory of Taiwan and playing the "two Chinas" scheme, seriously infringing upon our country's territorial sovereignty. The Chinese and Costa Rican people are both victims of imperialist aggression, and now our two countries still faces a common enemy. In the struggle against U.S. imperialism and safeguarding national independence, we must unite and support each other. The Chinese people will always stand on the side of the Latin American people.

He also said: The Chinese people are making their best efforts to build their own socialist country. We need a long-term international peaceful environment. The Chinese people have always loved peace and resolutely oppose wars of aggression. The People's Republic of China has never invaded others and never will.

Chairman Zhu De concluded: Friends of the delegation, you will be leaving us tomorrow to return home. On the eve of your departure, I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks for your efforts to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Costa Rican people, and please convey the respect and friendship of the Chinese people to the people of Costa Rica and Latin America.

Parliamentarian Marcial Aguiluz delivered an enthusiastic speech at the banquet. He said that we have only been in China for fifteen days, but we have seen a lot, asked a lot, and learned a lot. We believe that a great revolution of this century is taking place here, and we want to tell our people all this.

Aguiluz also said that after we go back, we will tell the people of Latin America, from house to house, from village to village, from county to county, from city to city: everything that the United States, Britain, France, and all imperialist countries say about China is a despicable lie.

He said that U.S. imperialism once said that there was a bamboo curtain in China, but there is no bamboo curtain here. I say that it is only the smoke screen that imperialism has erected before our eyes. But now this layer of smoke screen has also disappeared, just as all hypocrisy will disappear.

Parliamentarian Aguiluz expressed gratitude to the Chinese leaders and the Chinese people for the great sympathy shown for their struggle and for their warm hospitality.

He said, we will leave here tomorrow, but we will leave half of our hearts in this noble and brave land. He finally hoped that the Chinese people and the Costa Rican people would continuously strengthen friendly exchanges.

Also present at today's banquet were: Hu Yuzhi, Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs; Chu Tunan, President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association, and Zhou Erfu, Vice President; as well as some members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and well-known figures from all walks of life.

Lei Renmin, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, and Shen Jian, Director of the Department of American and Australian Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also attended the banquet. (Attached picture)

    朱委员长在招待哥斯达黎加议员代表团的宴会上说
    中哥人民在对敌斗争中互相支持
    哥斯达黎加朋友盛赞中国伟大革命，希望中哥两国人民不断加强友好往来
    新华社27日讯　朱德委员长今晚举行宴会招待正在我国访问的哥斯达黎加议员代表团。
    郭沫若、林枫副委员长也出席了宴会。
    朱德委员长在宴会上讲话，他首先代表全国人民代表大会常务委员会和中国人民表示热烈的欢迎。
    他指出：各位朋友冲破美帝国主义的压力和威胁来到我国，这充分说明哥斯达黎加人民要求发展同中国人民友好关系的真诚愿望。两国人民友好的共同愿望，是任何帝国主义所阻挡不了的。我们希望，随着你们的足迹将有更多哥斯达黎加朋友前来我国访问。
    朱德委员长说：美帝国主义正在通过美洲国家外长会议、利用“泛美主义”的幌子，胁迫拉丁美洲国家，企图扼杀古巴的独立并进一步奴役拉丁美洲各国。同时，美帝国主义还霸占着我国领土台湾，并且玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋，严重地侵犯我国的领土主权。中、哥两国人民都是帝国主义侵略的受难者，现在我们两国仍面临着共同的敌人。在反对美帝国主义、维护民族独立的斗争中，我们必须团结一致、互相支持。中国人民永远站在拉丁美洲人民的一边。
    他还说：中国人民正在以最大的努力建设自己的社会主义国家。我们需要一个长时期的国际和平环境。中国人民一向热爱和平、坚决反对侵略战争。中华人民共和国从来没有，也永远不会侵略别人。
    朱德委员长最后说：代表团的朋友们，明天就要离开我们回国了，在临别前夕，我愿意借此机会，对你们为加强中、哥两国人民友谊所做的努力表示衷心的感谢，并请你们把中国人民的敬意和友情带给哥斯达黎加和拉丁美洲人民。
    议员马西亚尔·阿吉卢斯在宴会上发表了热情的讲话。他说，我们来到中国仅仅只有十五天，但是看了很多、问了很多，并且了解了很多东西。我们相信这里正在进行着本世纪伟大的革命，我们要把这一切告诉我国人民。
    阿吉卢斯还说，我们回去以后，要从这一家到那一家，从这一村到那一村，从一个县到另一县，从一个城市到另一个城市地告诉拉丁美洲人民：美国、英国、法国以及所有帝国主义国家，他们关于中国所讲的一切都是卑鄙的谎言。
    他说，美帝国主义曾经说在中国有竹幕，但是这里没有竹幕，我说，只有帝国主义在我们眼前张起的烟幕。但是，现在这层烟幕也消失了，正如所有虚伪的东西都要消失一样。
    议员阿吉卢斯对中国领导人和中国人民对他们的斗争所表现的巨大同情和对他们的热情款待表示感谢。
    他说，我们将在明天离开这里，但是我们将在这个崇高的、勇敢的土地上留下半片心。他最后希望中国人民和哥斯达黎加人民不断加强友好往来。
    参加今天宴会的还有：中国人民外交学会副会长胡愈之；中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南、副会长周而复；以及全国人民代表大会常务委员会部分委员和各界著名人士。
    对外贸易部副部长雷任民、外交部美澳司司长申健也参加了宴会。（附图片）
