Firmly Grasp Field Management to Strive for Late Rice to Surpass Early Rice
Huangyan County Launches a High-Standard, High-Quality Field Management Competition Upsurge

(Our newspaper's Hangzhou dispatch, August 12th) After victoriously completing the continuous cropping late rice transplanting task, Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, through mass inspection and evaluation, commended good people and good deeds, and seized the opportunity to quickly launch a high-standard, high-efficiency, high-quality field management competition upsurge, striving for late rice to surpass early rice.

The Huangyan County Party Committee carefully analyzed the current excellent situation. When the summer harvest and summer planting were basically completed, it called on the entire Party and all the people to boost their efforts, strive for advancement, fight hard for one hundred days, and have every mu surpass early rice. This call immediately received enthusiastic response from the broad masses of cadres and commune members, and powerfully promoted a high-standard competition movement centered on accumulating and applying fertilizer and weeding and replanting seedlings in field management. However, there were also a few people who held incorrect attitudes towards late rice surpassing early rice. Some production teams completed the continuous cropping late rice transplanting task quickly and with high quality this year, before the Great Heat, and the rice seedlings are currently all turning green and growing well. Therefore, they were blindly optimistic and developed slackening sentiments such as wanting to "wash their feet and go ashore." In addition, some production teams were slower in harvesting and planting and lacked confidence in late rice surpassing early rice. They believed that the rice transplanted before the "Great Heat" could surpass early rice in yield, but the rice transplanted after the "Great Heat" would be difficult to surpass. These places are currently not paying close attention to field management. In order to thoroughly criticize and overcome these erroneous ideas, the county Party committee, on the one hand, presented the facts of the Luqiao Improved Seed Farm: last year, due to the large number of late-maturing varieties of early rice, some continuous cropping late rice transplanting was delayed until early August to complete, but because the farm persisted in managing while planting, cultivating early and often, cultivating the field twice throughout the season, and applying fertilizer twice, the unit yield increased by 20%-30% compared to early rice. This fact broke the superstitious idea held by some cadres and masses that late rice transplanted after the "Great Heat" could not surpass early rice. On the other hand, through mass "five inspections" (inspecting area, inspecting density, inspecting missing plants, inspecting rice seedlings, inspecting household fertilizer) and "five comparisons" (comparing drive, comparing work efficiency, comparing fertilizer, comparing tillering, comparing rice seedlings), setting up opposing examples at each level, and grasping rectification at the field head, the county thoroughly criticized complacency and slackening sentiments. At the same time, the county further mobilized the masses to analyze favorable conditions, boost their efforts, and enhance their confidence and determination in late rice surpassing early rice.

The entire county, through mass inspection, made everyone see that the quality of continuous cropping late rice transplanting this year was good, the density was increased by more than 5,000 plants per mu compared to last year, the base fertilizer was also greatly increased compared to last year, and improved varieties were fully popularized; for the fields with late transplanting season and poor quality, through early topdressing, weeding, replanting seedlings, cultivating more and fertilizing more, the yield can also completely catch up with early transplanted rice. This further boosted the enthusiasm of cadres and commune members and established a strong confidence in late rice surpassing early rice. On this basis, the Huangyan County Party Committee seized the Chengjiang Commune, which had fast progress, high quality in transplanting and field management, and well-growing rice seedlings, as a model, and launched a late rice surpassing early rice competition throughout the county, organizing various places to respond.

What should be the most prominent aspect of high-standard field management at present? On which key issues should the leadership be determined? In order to summarize experience in this area, secretaries at all levels throughout the county went deep into the front line of production, took the masses as teachers, and consulted experienced farmers. Wu Shufu, the first secretary of the county Party committee, went deep into the Fangshanxia Production Team of Chengjiang Commune, and through a forum with old farmers, found that continuous cropping late rice tillering generally starts from seven or eight days after transplanting until before the "White Dew" solar term. The earlier the tillering, the earlier the heading and grain filling, the larger the panicle, the more grains, the earlier the maturity, and the less the lodging. From this law, it was recognized that the key to late rice surpassing early rice lies in early management and fertilizer. And according to the characteristics of this year's partial fields with late transplanting season and poor quality, it was proposed to take fertilizer as the key and tillering as the guideline, resolutely grasp early weeding and more weeding, early fertilization, rational fertilization, inspecting seedlings and replanting seedlings, and ensuring 400,000 basic seedlings per mu. In order to quickly overcome the tillering hurdle, all localities, according to the instructions of the county Party committee, concentrated 90% of the labor force and invested them in accumulating fertilizer, applying fertilizer, and weeding and replanting seedlings. After the Toutuo Commune rationally arranged its labor force and organized 40% of the labor force to strengthen the fertilizer accumulation front, it cleared out 60,000 dan of household fertilizer in three days, increased the accumulation of 6 million jin of oyster shell ash, 500,000 jin of humic acid sodium, and 360,000 dan of miscellaneous soil fertilizer, averaging 12 dan of standard fertilizer per mu. At present, the entire commune is seizing the favorable opportunity of abundant weeds and luxuriant melon vines, mobilizing everyone to take action and every household to accumulate fertilizer, cutting green grass, salvaging aquatic plants, pulling mung bean stalks, and cutting old melon vines, and vigorously carrying out field composting. Coastal areas are organizing professional teams to vigorously produce fish fertilizer.

In order to strive for high yields of late rice over large areas, Party organizations at all levels in Huangyan County also paid special attention to strengthening leadership over backward areas, implementing county-level support for communes, commune-level support for brigades, brigade-level support for production teams, production team-level support for small teams, and everyone being responsible, from top to bottom. The county Party committee assigned Wang Maoguan and Xu Jiliang, secretaries of the county Party committee secretariat, to take responsibility for Luqiao, Xinqiao, and Hongjia Communes, which had later transplanting seasons and poorer quality.

Currently, more than 70,000 laborers throughout the county are going up the mountains and down to the sea to accumulate and create large amounts of fertilizer. As of August 7th, a total of 4.8 million dan of high-quality fertilizer has been accumulated, including 35 million jin of oyster shell ash, humic acid sodium, and fish fertilizer. About half of the total area of late rice fields has generally received an additional fertilizer application. At the same time, various localities, through summarizing the good experience of using weeding machines in early rice production, are determined to fully promote weeding machines in late rice production. Currently, 13,800 weeding machines are being used in intercropped late rice and late rice fields transplanted with nursery seedlings. As of the 7th, 65% of the late rice throughout the county had completed the first weeding, and the replanting of seedlings was completed in conjunction with weeding. (Photo attached)

### 狠抓田间管理争取晚稻超早稻  黄岩县掀起高标准高质量田间管理竞赛热潮

    狠抓田间管理争取晚稻超早稻
    黄岩县掀起高标准高质量田间管理竞赛热潮
    本报杭州12日电　浙江黄岩县在胜利完成连作晚稻插秧任务后，通过群众性检查评比，表扬好人好事，趁热打铁，迅速掀起了高标准、高工效、高质量田间管理竞赛热潮，力争晚稻超早稻。
    中共黄岩县委认真分析了当前大好形势，当夏收夏种基本结束时，就号召全党全民鼓干劲，争上游，奋战一百天，亩亩超早稻。这一号召立即获得广大干部社员的热烈响应，有力地推动了以积肥施肥、耘田补苗为中心的田间管理高标准竞赛运动。但是，也有少数人对晚稻超早稻存在不正确的态度。一部分生产队今年收种进度快、质量高，大暑前就完成连作晚稻插秧任务，目前稻苗全部转青，生长良好，因此，就盲目乐观，产生了“洗脚上岸”等等松劲情绪。另外一部分生产队收种进度较慢，对晚稻超早稻信心不足。他们认为“大暑”前插的秧，产量可以超早稻，“大暑”后插的秧就很难超早稻。这些地方当前田间管理也抓得不紧。为了彻底批判与克服这些错误思想，县委一方面摆出路桥良种场的事实：去年他们由于早稻迟熟品种多，部分连作晚稻插秧拖延到8月初才完成，但是由于该场坚持边种边管，早耘多耘，全季多耘两遍田，多施两次肥，结果单位产量比早稻增产20％—30％。这个事实，破除了部分干部、群众认为大暑后插秧晚稻不能超早稻的迷信思想。另一方面，通过群众性“五查”（查面积、查密植、查缺株、查稻苗、查家肥）“五比”（比干劲、比工效、比肥料、比发棵、比稻苗），层层设置对立面，大抓田头整风，彻底批判自满松劲情绪。与此同时，进一步发动群众，分析有利条件，大鼓干劲，增强晚稻超早稻的信心与决心。
    全县通过群众性大检查，使大家看到今年连作晚稻插秧质量好，密度比去年每亩增加五千丛以上，基肥也比去年大大增加，良种全面普及；插秧季节迟、质量差的田，通过提早追肥、耘田、补苗、多施多耘，产量也完全可能赶上早插稻。这样就进一步鼓足了干部、社员的干劲，树立了晚稻超早稻的坚强信心。在这个基础上，黄岩县委又抓住插秧和田间管理进度快、质量高、稻苗生长好的澄江公社为标兵，向全县发起晚稻超早稻竞赛，组织各地响应。
    高标准田间管理，在当前最突出的应当抓什么？领导上应当在哪些关键性问题上下决心？为了总结这方面的经验，全县各级书记纷纷深入生产第一线，拜群众为师，向有经验的农民请教。县委第一书记吴书福深入到澄江公社方山下生产队，通过老农座谈会，摸索出连作晚稻发棵一般都是从插秧后七、八天到“白露”前止，发棵愈早，抽穗灌浆就早，穗头大，粒数多，成熟早，不倒伏。从这一规律中，认识到晚稻超早稻的关键在于前期管理和肥料。并且根据今年部分田插秧季节迟、质量较差的特点，提出肥料挂帅，发棵为纲，坚决抓住早耘多耘，早施肥，合理施肥，查苗补苗，保证每亩四十万基本苗等有力措施。为了尽快攻下发棵关，各地都根据县委指示，集中90％劳力，分别投入积肥、施肥、耘田补苗。头陀公社通过合理安排劳力，组织40％劳力加强积肥战线后，三天时间就清理出家肥六万担，增积蛎灰六百万斤，胡敏酸钠五十万斤，土杂肥三十六万担，平均每亩积标准肥十二担。目前，全社又抓住百草丛生、瓜藤茂盛的有利时机，发动人人动手，家家积肥，割青草，捞水草，拔绿豆秆，割老瓜藤，大搞田头沤肥。沿海地区组织专业队，大搞鱼肥。
    为了力争晚稻大面积高产，黄岩县各级党组织还特别注意加强对后进地区的领导，实行县包社，社包大队，大队包生产队，生产队包小队，人人包干，一竿到底。县委对插秧季节较迟、质量较差的路桥、新桥、洪家等公社分别由县委书记处书记王茂官、许继良等同志分工包干。
    目前全县有七万多劳力上山下海，大积大造肥料。到8月7日止，共积优质肥料四百八十万担，其中蛎灰、胡敏酸钠、鱼肥等三千五百万斤。有约占总面积近一半的晚稻田，普遍增施了一次肥料。与此同时，各地又通过总结早稻生产中使用耘田器的好经验，决心在晚稻生产中全面推行耘田器。目前已有一万三千八百部耘田器正在间作晚稻和用寄秧插的晚稻田里使用。全县到7日止，已有65％的晚稻结束第一次耘田，结合耘田，完成了补苗工作。（附图片）
