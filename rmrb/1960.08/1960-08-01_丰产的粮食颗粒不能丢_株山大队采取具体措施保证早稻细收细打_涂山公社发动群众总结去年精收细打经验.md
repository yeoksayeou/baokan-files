Do not waste the abundant grain
Zhushan Brigade takes concrete measures to ensure careful harvesting of early rice; Tushan Commune mobilizes the masses to summarize last year's experience in careful harvesting

    (Our report) The Zhushan Brigade of Shangyunqiao Commune in You County, Hunan Province, has taken concrete measures to ensure the careful harvesting of early rice. Since the early rice harvest began in mid-July, it has been discovered that there is waste due to cutting the rice stalks and dropping the ears, threshing the rice without cleaning it, or not threshing it thoroughly. According to preliminary estimates, about 37 catties of grain are lost per mu. In order to stop the waste, the brigade promptly held a forum for commune members to find the reasons. Some people believe that the task of harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice is large and time is tight, and they worry that careful harvesting will affect the progress of harvesting and transplanting, so it is inevitable to lose some. According to these thoughts of the masses, the brigade decided to vigorously grasp ideological education, and explain to the masses the method of accounting, explaining that if the team's 2,000 mu of early rice is lost by 37 catties per mu as it is now, it will lose 74,000 catties of grain, which can feed 165 people for a year. On the basis of raising ideological awareness, the Zhushan Brigade adopted six concrete measures to ensure careful harvesting. First, skillfully arrange labor, using those who are good at cutting to cut, and those who are good at harvesting to harvest; a reasonable combination of new and old hands is used. Those who use barrel threshing are generally in groups of five, with three experienced workers leading two novices; those who use threshing machines are in groups of seven, with four masters leading three apprentices, four cutting and three threshing. In order to quickly popularize harvesting techniques, more than 100 people were trained in technical training classes in the fields to teach the operating techniques of advanced tools. Second, repair the damaged tools in a concentrated effort. The entire team conducted an inspection and found that five threshing machines, fourteen barrels, and two hundred and four loads of baskets needed to be repaired. Fourteen iron, wood, and bamboo workers were immediately organized to carry materials to the groups, teams, and fields to repair them in a concentrated effort. After two days of hard work, they have been repaired. Third, harvest at the right time. According to the experience of harvesting at 90% maturity, the team's seedlings were ranked. Fourth, formulate operating procedures for harvesting techniques. When cutting rice, be gentle when cutting, lifting, and placing. When threshing rice, lift lightly and drop heavily, turn it frequently and thresh it hard. When transporting grain, the baskets should not be full, the baskets should be tied tightly, the steps should be steady, and nothing should be dropped. When drying grain, dry it thinly and frequently after it is wet, thresh it and dry it immediately, and clean the barn. Fifth, organize ninety-two elementary school students and elderly people into nine groups to pick up rice ears in the fields. Sixth, carry out appraisal and competition, and organize inspection and acceptance. The brigade organizes acceptance groups led by the general branch secretary and each production team by the branch secretary to harvest one plot and inspect one plot. The production team inspects twice a day, and the brigade inspects once a day. The brigade has formulated a mobile red flag, regularly inspects and appraises, inserts red flags, sets up pacesetters, and carries out careful harvesting to the end.
    After the implementation of these measures, the phenomenon of throwing and wasting in the entire brigade has been greatly reduced; the rice that was not thoroughly threshed before has been re-threshed and re-harvested, recovering 850 catties of grain.

    (Our report) The Tushan People's Commune in the Nan'an District of Chongqing City, Sichuan Province, based on the experience of careful harvesting of rice last year and the harvest of minor spring crops this year, has been grasping the preparatory work for the careful harvesting of early rice to welcome the bumper harvest of early rice.
    The Nan'an District Committee of the Communist Party of China repeatedly carried out the mobilization work of careful harvesting at the meeting of cadres above the production captain of the commune. Some cadres and commune members have complacent emotions, thinking that the implementation of the battle plus "three changes" (adding a lid to the battle, adding a pocket to the mouth of the battle, and widening the mat) and light cutting, light putting, and light transportation during the harvesting of middle rice and late rice last year has greatly reduced the scattering, and this year it will be almost the same if we do it this way. In response to this idea, the district committee and the commune party committee mobilized the management districts and production teams to discuss it. In the discussion, everyone believed that although the scattering and waste had been greatly reduced, there were still phenomena of dropping ears and dropping grains, with more scattering reaching about 4%. Through summarizing experience and discussion, measures for careful harvesting were formulated: First, when harvesting, cadres must go to the fields and drying grounds to harvest and thresh with commune members. Second, the methods of harvesting and threshing have also been further improved. All early rice must be cut back to the drying ground for threshing to avoid scattering and waste caused by threshing in the fields; light cutting, light putting, and light transportation must be done when harvesting; vehicle loading and basket loading must be done during transportation; threshing must be done with grain threshing machines; drying grounds must be swept and collected carefully, without dropping ears or grains. Third, fully prepare tools. Sharpen sickles before harvesting, repair cattle-drawn carts and chicken carts, and inspect and repair more than 300 large and small drying grounds. The wind blowing tools have reached one to two new tiger head fans in each management area. The team's storage rooms are repaired to prevent rain, moisture, and rat holes. Fourth, immediately organize manpower to conduct investigations in the fields and make preparations for the field block harvesting work as soon as possible. (Attached picture)

    丰产的粮食颗粒不能丢
    株山大队采取具体措施保证早稻细收细打  涂山公社发动群众总结去年精收细打经验
    本报讯　湖南省攸县上云桥公社株山大队采取具体措施保证早稻细收细打。今年7月中旬收打早稻以来，发现有割禾丢穗，打禾掉粒或没有打净的浪费现象。据初步估算，每亩约损失谷三十七斤。为了堵塞浪费，大队及时召开社员座谈会找原因。有些人认为收早稻、插晚稻任务大、时间紧，耽心细打细收影响收、插进度，因此丢失一些也是难免的。根据群众的这些思想情况，大队决定要狠抓思想教育工作，并通过向群众算账的办法，说明全队二千亩早稻，如果像目前这样每亩丢失三十七斤，就要损失七万四千斤谷，这笔粮食可供一百六十五人吃一年。在提高思想觉悟的基础上，株山大队采取了六条具体措施，保证细打细收。第一，巧妙地安排劳动力，采用善割者割，善收者收；新老手合理搭配。采用扮桶脱粒的，一般是五人一组，三个老手带两个新手，三人割二人扮；使用打稻机的是七人一组，四个师傅带三个徒弟，四人割三人打。为了使收割技术能很快的普及，还分片在田间开办了一百多人的技术训练班，传授了先进工具的操作技术。第二，突击补修已损坏了的工具。全队进行了一次检查，发现有五部打稻机、十四张扮桶、二百零四担箩筐需要修理，立即组织了十四个铁、木、篾工人，携带材料，到组到队到田头突击修理，经过两天苦战已经修好。第三，适时收割，根据九成熟十分收的经验，对全队禾苗进行了排队。第四，制订收扮技术措施操作规程，割禾做到：轻割、轻提、轻放。扮禾做到轻举重落、勤翻重打。运谷做到谷不满箩，箩筐扎实。步伐稳健、不漏不丢。晒谷做到先湿后干，薄晒勤翻，随脱随晒，车净上仓。第五，将九十二个小学生、老年人组成九个拣禾穗小组，到田间拾禾。第六，开展评比竞赛，组织检查验收。大队以总支书记、各个生产队以分支书记为首组织验收组收一丘，验一丘，生产队一天二验，大队一天一验。大队制定了流动红旗，定期检查评比，插红旗，树标兵，细打细收，一抓到底。
    这些措施贯彻以后，全大队抛撒浪费现象大大减少；对以前脱粒不净的稻禾复打复收，收回了八百五十斤谷子。
    本报讯　四川重庆市南岸区涂山人民公社在总结去年水稻细收细打和今年小春收割经验的基础上，大抓早稻精收细打的准备工作，迎接早稻丰收。
    中共南岸区委会在公社生产队长以上的干部会上反复作了精收细打的动员工作。有个别干部和社员存在着自满情绪，认为去年收割中稻和晚稻实行了挞斗加“三改”（挞斗加盖、斗口加兜、斗席加宽）和轻割、轻放、轻运，已经大大减少了抛撒，今年照着这样作就差不多了。针对这种思想，区委和公社党委发动各管理区、生产队进行讨论。在讨论中，大家认为抛撒浪费虽然大大减少，但还有掉穗、掉粒的现象，多的抛撒达4％左右。通过总结经验和讨论，订出了精收细打的措施：第一，在收割时，干部一定要到田间、晒场，同社员一起收割、打场。第二，在收割脱粒方法上也进一步作了改进，坚决把全部早稻割回晒场脱粒，避免在田中脱粒而造成抛撒浪费；收割时要作到轻割、轻放、轻运；运输时作到用车子载、箩兜装；脱粒全部用挞谷机脱粒；晒场要求细扫细收，不掉穗，不丢粒。第三，充分作好工具准备。在收割前磨好镰刀，修好牛拉车、鸡公车，把三百多块大小晒场检查修补好。风扬工具达到每个管理区有一至二部新式的虎头大风车。队队的保管室修补好，作到不漏雨、不潮湿、无鼠洞。第四，立即组织人力到田头进行调查，及早作好田块收割排队工作。（附图片）
