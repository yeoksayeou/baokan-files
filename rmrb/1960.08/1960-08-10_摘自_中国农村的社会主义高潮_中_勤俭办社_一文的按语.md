Diligence and thrift in management should be the guiding principle for all agricultural production cooperatives in the country—no, it should be the guiding principle for all economic undertakings. We should run factories with diligence and thrift, run stores with diligence and thrift, run all state-owned and cooperative enterprises with diligence and thrift, and run all other undertakings with diligence and thrift. The principle of diligence and thrift should be implemented in everything we do. This is the principle of economy, and economy is one of the basic principles of socialist economics. China is a large country, but it is still very poor. It will take decades to make China rich. Even after several decades, we will still need to implement the principle of diligence and thrift, but it is especially important to advocate diligence and thrift, and to pay special attention to economy, in the current decades, during the current several Five-Year Plan periods.

    勤俭经营应当是全国一切农业生产合作社的方针，不，应当是一切经济事业的方针。勤俭办工厂，勤俭办商店，勤俭办一切国营事业和合作事业，勤俭办一切其他事业，什么事情都应当执行勤俭的原则。这就是节约的原则，节约是社会主义经济的基本原则之一。中国是一个大国，但是现在还很穷，要使中国富起来，需要几十年时间。几十年以后也需要执行勤俭的原则，但是特别要提倡勤俭，特别要注意节约的，是在目前这几十年内，是在目前这几个五年计划的时期内。
