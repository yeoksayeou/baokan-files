Xinhua News Agency, August 21st. Scientists in the capital today warmly congratulated the great achievement of the safe return of the Soviet spaceship to Earth. Scientists unanimously pointed out that this is a great contribution to the scientific undertaking of mankind, and it is not far off that mankind will enter outer space.

    Mechanics expert Qian Xuesen believes that the return of the Soviet Union's second spaceship to Earth is a new milestone on the road for mankind to conquer the universe. He said that the safe landing of the 4,600-kilogram spaceship on the Earth's surface with a deviation of about ten kilometers from the predetermined landing point means that the time when the spaceship "started driving" from the satellite orbit to the ground differed from the predetermined driving time by no more than one second. This means that when the spaceship "started driving" from the satellite orbit, the orientation of the spaceship was very accurate, so the braking rocket could fully function according to the predetermined calculations. This means that Soviet designers and scientists have completely and successfully applied the last-stage heat protection technology of the two Pacific rocket launches to the giant spaceship, thus ensuring that the high-intensity air friction heating could not burn the spaceship when it re-entered the atmosphere. This means that when the spaceship descended to the lower atmosphere, the braking device of the spaceship, such as a parachute or rotating blades, was completely successfully opened and operated, so that the speed of the spaceship when it landed did not exceed the landing speed of a general parachute jump. These are all great achievements in the design of spacecraft.

    Geophysicist Zhao Jiuzhang said that returning to Earth is an extremely difficult and complex problem in space navigation. During the descent of the spacecraft, it enters the dense atmosphere, and due to friction with the air, the temperature of the hull is quite high. Without temperature protection and deceleration equipment, the spacecraft would be burned. This is a key issue for mankind to enter outer space. In less than three years since the launch of the first artificial satellite, Soviet scientists have successfully solved this problem, which is a major event in the scientific undertaking of mankind.

    Zhao Jiuzhang added that the landing point of the Soviet Union's second spaceship was only about ten kilometers away from the predetermined location. From the accuracy of the landing point, it can be seen that the Soviet Union has made rapid progress in telemetry control technology and rapid and accurate orbital calculations, and has far surpassed the United States.

    Biologist Bei Shizhang pointed out that the great achievement of the safe landing of the spaceship provides a reliable guarantee for the further realization of human space flight. The radio telemetry records and television images prove that animals can still maintain normal life under such a long period of weightlessness, which is a very valuable piece of data. The sealed cabin now carries a puppy, but the settings inside are equipped according to all the necessary conditions for future human flight into space; now the puppy has completed the flight mission, which shows that human life in the sealed cabin is also reliably guaranteed. The landing point of the sealed cabin returning to Earth is so accurate, and the puppy feels very good after the flight and landing, which proves that human space flight can be safe.

    Automation expert Lu Yuanjiu said that the three artificial satellites, three space rockets, and a series of other rockets launched by the Soviet Union in the past all adopted the method of ballistic rockets. This launching method only precisely controls the direction and speed of the rocket's movement in the first few minutes of the rocket launch. However, this time, on the one hand, it is necessary to precisely control the launch so that the spaceship can enter orbit; on the other hand, after the rocket orbits the Earth eighteen times and operates for twenty-four hours, it is also necessary to precisely control it to return to Earth according to a certain orbit and land at a predetermined location about ten kilometers away. This proves that the Soviet Union's rocket navigation system can work precisely and reliably for dozens of hours, which solves a major key problem for mankind to fly to the moon and return to Earth. If the accuracy and reliability of the control navigation system can be further improved so that it can work reliably for several months or years, then it will not be difficult for mankind to fly to other planets in the solar system and return safely to Earth.

    Aeronautical scientist He Qingzhi said that the three artificial Earth satellites and three space rockets launched by the Soviet Union in the past two years or so can be said to have solved the problem of accurately and reliably sending spacecraft into orbit in terms of rocket technology, while this time, it has basically solved the problem of the safe return of spacecraft to Earth, thereby creating the most important conditions for manned space flight. The safe landing of the second spaceship at a location with a deviation of about ten kilometers from the predetermined landing point is an extraordinary scientific achievement. The equipment that ensures the safe passage of the spaceship through the dense atmosphere without being burned and the safe landing is very precise and reliable.

    人类征服宇宙道路上的里程碑
    首都科学家热烈祝贺苏联宇宙飞船安全返回地面
    新华社21日讯　首都科学家今天热烈祝贺苏联宇宙飞船安全地返回地面的伟大成就。科学家们一致指出，这是对人类科学事业的巨大贡献，人类进入宇宙空间已是不远的事情了。
    力学家钱学森认为苏联第二个宇宙飞船回到地面，是人类征服宇宙的大道上的一个新的里程碑。他说，重达四千六百公斤的宇宙飞船安全地降落到同预定着陆点的偏差约为十公里的地球表面，这意味着当宇宙飞船从卫星轨道上向地面“开车”的时间，离预定行车时间所差不超出一秒钟。这意味着宇宙飞船从卫星轨道上“开车”时，宇宙飞船的方位是对得很准的，因而制动火箭能完全按照预定的计算发挥作用。这意味着苏联的设计师和科学家们已经完全成功地把两次发射太平洋火箭的一套最后一级防热技术用到巨型宇宙飞船上来，从而保证了飞船再入空气层时，高强度空气磨擦加热不能把宇宙飞船烧坏。这意味着当宇宙飞船下降到低层大气时，宇宙飞船的制动装置、像降落伞或旋转桨叶，完全成功地打开并动作，使得宇宙飞船落地时，其速度不超过一般跳降落伞的着地速度。这都是在设计宇宙飞行器方面的伟大成就。
    地球物理学家赵九章说，重返地面是宇宙航行中一个极其困难复杂的问题。飞船在下降中，进入稠密的大气层，由于和空气的磨擦，船体的温度是相当高的，如果没有防温及减速装备，飞船是要烧毁的。这是人类进入宇宙空间的一个关键问题。距第一个人造卫星上天还不到三年的时间，苏联科学家们胜利地解决了这个问题，这是人类在科学事业上的一件大事。
    赵九章又说，苏联第二个宇宙飞船着陆地点距预定地点相差仅约十公里，从着落点的准确程度来说，可以看出苏联在遥测控制技术、快速精确的轨道计算等方面，有了飞速的进展，已远远把美国抛在后面了。
    生物学家贝时璋指出，宇宙飞船安全着陆的伟大成就为实现人的宇宙飞行进一步提供了可靠的保证。从无线电遥测记录和电视发送影像证明动物在这样长的时间失重情况下，生活还是可以正常维持的，这是一个非常宝贵的资料。密封舱里现在载了小狗，但是里面的设置都是根据未来人飞入宇宙的一切必需条件装备起来的；现在小狗已经完成了飞行的任务，这说明人在密封舱里生活也是有可靠保证的。密封舱返回地球的着陆地点如此准确，而小狗在飞行和着陆后感觉很好，这又证明人进行宇宙飞行是可以安全的。
    自动化专家陆元九说，过去苏联发射的三个人造卫星、三个宇宙火箭以及其他一系列火箭，都是采用弹道火箭的方法，这种发射方法只是在火箭发射的最初几分钟，对火箭的运动方向及速度进行精密的控制。可是这次，一方面在发射时要精密控制，使宇宙飞船能够进入轨道，另一方面当火箭绕地球十八圈、运行二十四小时之后，还要精密的控制，按照一定的轨道返回地球，并在预定地点约为十公里的地方着陆。这证明了苏联的火箭导航系统，可以在几十小时内精密可靠地进行工作，这就为人类飞向月球及返回地球解决了一个重大的关键问题。如果进一步提高控制导航系统的精确可靠性，使它能很可靠的工作几个月、几年的话，那么人类飞往太阳系的其它行星，并安全返回地球也不是困难的事情了。
    航空科学家何庆芝说，两年多以来苏联所发射的三个人造地球卫星和三个宇宙火箭，可以说在火箭技术上解决了把宇宙飞行器准确可靠地送入轨道的问题，而这次则基本解决了宇宙飞行器安全返回地球的问题，从而为载人宇宙飞行创造了最主要的条件。第二个宇宙飞船安全地降落到同预定着陆点的偏差约为十公里的地方，更是非常了不起的科学成就，保证飞船安全通过稠密大气层不被烧毁和安全着陆的设备都是非常精密可靠的。
