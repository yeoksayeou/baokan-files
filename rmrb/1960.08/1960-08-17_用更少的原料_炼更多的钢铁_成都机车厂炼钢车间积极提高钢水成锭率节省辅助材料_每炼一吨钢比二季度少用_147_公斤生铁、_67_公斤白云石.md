According to Chengdu Daily: Steelmaking workers at the Chengdu Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant in Sichuan are vigorously saving raw materials in the process of striving for sustained high-quality and high-yield steel production. Since July, compared with the second quarter, each ton of steel produced saves 147 kilograms of pig iron, 127 kilograms of coke, and 67 kilograms of dolomite; the average consumption cost of steel ingot molds in July was only one-sixteenth of that in the second quarter.

The Party organization of this plant frequently educates workers to establish a comprehensive view of completing plans, promote a sense of responsibility as masters of the country, and constantly care about saving, caring about saving everywhere. During the shock cleanup of slag accumulated in the steelmaking workshop, the Party organization combined specific facts to educate workers to recognize that reducing waste slag means increasing production, putting forward the slogan "Less Slag in Steelmaking" and launching a mass movement to improve ingot yield and not waste a drop of molten steel.

In order to improve the steel ingot yield, the workers formed a "one-stop" system from the iron-melting furnace to casting, focusing on temperature and pouring, with downstream processes considering the needs of upstream processes, and upstream processes creating favorable conditions for downstream processes. Workshop leaders also went deep into the casting area to work and consult with workers, pouring every drop of molten steel into the ingot molds. The ingot yield has been greatly improved. Compared with last year, for every 100 tons of molten steel produced, more than 30 tons of steel ingots can be produced. Workers have also actively sought ways to improve furnace life from dolomite calcination, furnace lining patching, and blowing, which not only ensured high yield but also greatly reduced the consumption of raw materials such as dolomite. Since July, the dolomite consumption per ton of steel produced has been only one-third of that in the second quarter.

Extensive development of savings and substitution activities is an important aspect of this plant's large-scale excavation of raw material potential. In order to save dolomite, workers adopted the method of replacing the new with the old on the premise of ensuring quality, recovering old furnace linings to replace some good materials, which saved coke, dolomite, and tar. The steelmaking workshop used old furnace linings to replace good materials for patching furnace caps, and has not requested a single kilogram of dolomite from the factory department for more than two months. Due to various efforts to save pig iron in the steelmaking workshop, the average iron consumption in July decreased by 53% compared with June, and the cost of steel ingots decreased by 85.5%.

In the mass movement of saving raw materials, the workers of this plant have established strict management systems. The steelmaking workshop also frequently holds economic activity analysis conferences for all workshop employees or smaller-scale economic activity analyses in front of the furnace, so that employees can understand which raw material consumption is rising, which raw material consumption is falling, and find the reasons for the rise and fall, so that the implementation of various management systems and ensuring the reduction of raw material consumption become the conscious actions of employees. In order to resolutely implement the system of not wasting molten steel casually, when encountering low-temperature molten steel, workers use oxygen to burn through the taphole of the steel ladle to take out the low-temperature molten steel for casting into ingots.

### 用更少的原料　炼更多的钢铁  成都机车厂炼钢车间积极提高钢水成锭率节省辅助材料  每炼一吨钢比二季度少用147公斤生铁、67公斤白云石

    用更少的原料　炼更多的钢铁
    成都机车厂炼钢车间积极提高钢水成锭率节省辅助材料
    每炼一吨钢比二季度少用147公斤生铁、67公斤白云石
    据成都日报消息　四川成都机车车辆工厂炼钢职工，在争取炼钢生产持续优质高产的过程中，大力节约原材料。7月份以来，和第二季度比较，每炼一吨钢可以节约一百四十七公斤生铁、一百二十七公斤焦炭、六十七公斤白云石；钢锭模的平均消耗费用7月份仅及第二季度的十六分之一。
    这个厂的党组织经常教育职工树立全面完成计划的观点，发扬主人翁的责任感，经常关心节约，处处关心节约。在突击清理炼钢车间积渣时，党组织结合具体事实，教育职工们认识到减少废渣，就是增产，提出“炼钢少炼渣”的口号，掀起了提高成锭率、不浪费一点钢水的群众运动。
    为了提高钢水成锭率，职工们组成从化铁炉到浇注的“一条龙”，抓温度、抓浇注，下工序为上工序着想，上工序为下工序创造有利条件。车间领导干部也深入浇注工区和工人同劳动，同商量，把一点一滴的钢水都注入钢锭模。成锭率大大提高。现在和去年比较，每炼出一百吨钢水，就可以多生产出三十多吨钢锭。职工们还从白云石的锻烧、炉衬的打结、吹炼等方面，积极设法提高炉龄，既保证了高产，又大大减少了白云石等原材料的消耗。7月以来，每炼一吨钢的白云石耗用量，仅等于第二季度的三分之一。
    广泛开展节约、代用活动，是这个厂大挖原材料潜力的一个重要方面。为了节约白云石，职工们在保证质量的前提下，采取以旧代新的办法，回收旧炉衬代替部分好料，既节约了焦炭、白云石，又节约了焦油。炼钢车间打结炉帽，全部用旧炉衬代替好料，两个多月没有向厂部要过一斤白云石。炼钢车间由于多方设法节约生铁，7月份的平均铁耗比6月份降低53％，钢锭成本降低85.5％。
    在群众性的节约原材料的活动中，这个厂的职工建立了严密的管理制度。炼钢车间还经常召开全车间职工大会进行经济活动分析或较小型的炉前经济活动分析，使职工了解什么原材料消耗上升，什么原材料消耗下降，寻找上升、下降的原因，使执行各项管理制度、保证降低原材料耗用，成为职工们的自觉行动。为了坚决贯彻执行不随便浪费钢水的制度，遇上低温钢水时，职工们就用氧气把钢包水口烧穿，夺出低温钢水来浇注成锭。
