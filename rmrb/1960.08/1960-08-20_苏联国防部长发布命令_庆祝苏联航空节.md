Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 18th: TASS reported from Moscow on August 18th that the Soviet Minister of Defense, Marshal Malinovsky, issued an order on August 18th to celebrate Soviet Aviation Day.

The order pointed out that the Soviet Union is greeting this festival in a situation where it has achieved new victories in communist construction. The Soviet government has consistently and unremittingly striven to eliminate the danger of a new war and to improve the international situation. However, the imperialist forces are intensifying the situation and continuing the "cold war." The intrusion of American aircraft into Soviet airspace is a deliberate provocation and military adventure by imperialist aggressors. The order emphasized that, under these circumstances, the task of every member of the Soviet Air Force, like all Soviet soldiers, is to continuously improve technology, strengthen the combat readiness of the army, demonstrate a high degree of vigilance, and be prepared to teach any aggressor a lesson.

    苏联国防部长发布命令
    庆祝苏联航空节
    新华社18日电　据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅在18日发布了庆祝苏联航空节的命令。
    命令中指出，苏联是在共产主义建设取得新胜利的情况下迎接这个节日的。苏联政府一贯坚持不懈地争取消除新战争、争取改善国际局势，但是，帝国主义势力正在使局势尖锐化，继续进行“冷战”。美国飞机对苏联领空的侵犯，是帝国主义侵略势力的蓄意挑衅和军事冒险。命令中强调指出，在这种情况下，像全体苏联军人一样，苏联空军的每个成员的任务是，不断地改进技术，加强军队的战斗准备，表现出高度的警惕性，准备教训任何侵略者。
