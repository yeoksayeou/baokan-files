    Summarize Field Management Experience and Master Corn Growth Laws
    The Fenghuo Team of the Fenghuo Commune Focuses on Eliminating Empty Corn Stalks and Strives for More and Fuller Kernels

    (Our dispatch) The Qian County Fenghuo Production Team, led by Shaanxi agricultural labor model Wang Baojing, is determined to raise the level of corn field management to a higher level. Recently, under the guidance of Wei Guangzu, Deputy County Head of Qian County, and Sun Yanjiang, Secretary of the Fenghuo Commune Party Committee, they summarized their years of corn field management experience. From the summary, they initially understood the characteristics of corn, such as its preference for water, fertilizer, light, and warmth, and basically mastered the law of actively promoting and appropriately controlling corn in field management. They put forward the specific goal of "conquering five stages" to achieve "every plant producing multiple ears, and every ear weighing five liang." The corn field management movement, centered on eliminating empty stalks and transforming single-ear corn into double-ear corn, is being pushed to a more solid and detailed stage. In four days, the first cultivation and soil improvement, ditching and fertilization, and pest control of all corn were completed.
    From the summary, the reason why the Fenghuo Team has achieved stable high yields in corn for many years is mainly because the work of actively promoting and appropriately controlling has been done well and combined well throughout the field management process. On the one hand, they divide corn field management into five major stages: seedling, young ear differentiation, flowering, grain filling, and maturity. According to the characteristics of corn and the common and different purposes to be achieved in each stage, they provide water, nutrients, and light in a timely manner. Actively promoting the first step to achieve full, strong, and uniform seedlings; the second step to achieve strong stalks, good differentiation of small ears, and more ear formation; and the third step to achieve large ears and full kernels. On the other hand, in view of the weakness of corn being easily affected by adverse external conditions, resulting in "empty stalks" and many single ears, they try every means to take various measures, such as seedling control, cultivation and soil improvement, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, ventilation and light transmission, and prevention of wind and rainstorms, to control corn's excessive growth and lodging, so as to achieve the goal of eliminating empty stalks and transforming single-ear corn into double-ear corn.
    Promotion and control are dialectical relationships of mutual restriction, mutual influence, and mutual promotion. If the promotion work is done well, it will be conducive to control, and if the control is done well, the promotion will be better. According to the experience of labor model Wang Baojing, the most difficult to deal with in the active promotion and appropriate control of corn field management are water, fertilizer, and light. Corn likes fertilizer and water, but it is not the more the better. It should be timely, appropriate, suitable, and appropriate, and it should be based on the weather, the land, and the corn. Corn has a strong seasonality in growth. During the young ear differentiation period, it needs water and fertilizer urgently. Irrigation and fertilization immediately can immediately promote strong stalks and rapid ear differentiation. If the opportunity is missed, even if there is more water and fertilizer, the effect will not be significant. Corn does not need much water and fertilizer during the maturity period. Less irrigation and less fertilization can promote early maturity. Conversely, it will delay the maturity time. Corn needs more nitrogen and potassium fertilizer around the jointing stage, and only a large amount of phosphorus fertilizer is needed in the later stage. Applying fertilizer according to the taste of corn can not only promote young ear differentiation, but also prevent excessive growth and lodging. Ventilation and light transmission can enable corn to absorb a large amount of nutrients, eliminate "empty stalks" and produce more ears, but the problem of ventilation and light transmission cannot be solved by sparse planting. It is necessary to take the method of wide and narrow row cultivation to solve the problem of ventilation and light transmission under the condition of reasonable close planting.
    Through summarizing, understanding the characteristics, and finding the laws, the cadres of the Fenghuo Team received the most realistic education. The perceptual knowledge acquired in corn field management in the past has been raised to the rational stage. Soon, there was an activity in the whole team where everyone offered suggestions for doing a good job in this year's corn field management.
    There has been a long drought here this year, and many of the originally planned technical measures cannot meet the needs of the new situation. Each small team immediately changed the originally planned plan. Under normal circumstances, corn should be watered less or not watered at the jointing stage to promote seedling control to prevent excessive growth and lodging; the drought corn has been exercised and naturally controlled the seedlings, and the possibility of lodging and excessive growth is very small, so irrigation is advanced. In order to solve the contradiction between close planting and ventilation and light transmission, this team planted corn in wide and narrow rows when sowing. Some small teams did not follow this decision and planted in equal row spacing. Now these units are preparing to conduct experiments to strengthen ventilation and light transmission through cultivation and soil improvement. (Attached picture)

    总结田间管理经验　掌握玉米生长规律
    烽火公社烽火队主攻玉米空秆力争棒多粒饱
    本报讯　陕西农业劳动模范王保京领导的乾县烽火公社烽火生产队，决心把玉米的田间管理提到更高的水平。最近，在乾县副县长魏光祖、烽火公社党委书记孙彦江的指导下，总结了几年来的玉米田间管理经验。从总结中，初步摸清了玉米喜水、喜肥、喜光、喜温等脾性，基本上掌握了玉米在田间管理中既要积极促进，又要适当控制的规律。提出了“攻五关”达到“株株结多穗，穗穗长五两”的具体奋斗目标。把消灭空秆、变单穗成双穗为中心的玉米田间管理运动，推向更扎实更细致阶段。在四天里，全部玉米的第一次中耕培土、开沟施肥、防虫等就完成了。
    从总结中看，烽火队的玉米所以连年获得稳定高产，主要是整个田间管理中，积极促进和适当控制工作做得好，结合得好。一方面他们把玉米田间管理分为幼苗、幼穗分化、开花、灌浆、成熟等五大关，根据玉米特性和各个关要达到的共同目的与不同目的，及时供给水分、养分以及光。积极促进玉米第一步达到苗全、苗壮、苗匀；第二步达到秆壮、小穗分化好，多结棒；第三步达到棒大、粒饱。另方面，根据玉米容易受外界不利条件影响而产生“空秆”、单穗多的弱点，千方百计，采取各种措施，如蹲苗、中耕培土、防治病虫害、通风透光以及防风、防暴雨等，控制玉米疯长、倒伏，达到消灭空秆，变单穗玉米为双穗玉米的目的。
    促进和控制是相互制约，相互影响，彼此促进的辩证关系。促进工作做得好，就有利于控制，控制得好，促进得也更好。根据劳动模范王保京的体会，在玉米田间管理的积极促进和适当控制中，最难处理的是水、肥、光。玉米喜肥、喜水，但也不是越多越好，要适时、适量、适性、适当，要看天、看地、看玉米办事。玉米生长的季节性很强，幼穗化期间需要水肥很急，马上灌水、施肥，就能马上促进秆壮、穗分化快。错过了时机，水肥再多作用就不甚显著。玉米到了成熟期，需要水肥不多，少灌水少施肥就能促进早熟，反之，就会推迟成熟时间。玉米在拔节期前后，需要氮肥、钾肥较多，到了后期才需要大量磷肥，根据玉米这些味口施肥，既能促进幼穗分化，又能防止徒长、倒伏。通风透光能使玉米吸收大量养分，消灭“空秆”多结棒，但不能用稀植的办法解决通风透光问题，要在合理密植的情况下，采取宽窄行栽培的办法解决通风透光。
    通过总结，摸脾性，找规律，使烽火队的干部受到一次最现实教育。把过去在玉米田间管理上取得的感性知识，提高到理性阶段。很快在全队出现了一个大家为做好今年的玉米田间管理出谋献计活动。
    这里今年久旱不雨，原订的许多技术措施不能适应新形势需要，各小队就马上改变原订计划。在一般情况下，玉米在拔节期要少浇水或者不浇水，促使蹲苗，以防徒长和倒伏；天旱玉米受了锻炼天然地蹲了苗，倒伏和疯长的可能性很小，就提早灌水。为了解决密植与通风透光矛盾，这个队在玉米下种时，就种成了宽窄行，有些小队没按照这个决定办事，种成了等行距，现在这些单位，准备进行通过中耕培土加强通风透光的试验。（附图片）
