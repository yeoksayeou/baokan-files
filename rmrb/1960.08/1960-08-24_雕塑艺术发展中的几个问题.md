Several Problems in the Development of Sculpture Art
Liu Kaiqu

In the decade and more since liberation, China's sculpture undertaking has greatly developed and achieved tremendous successes. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, with the rapid advancement of the national economy and various undertakings, the vigorous atmosphere of sculpture has been unprecedented. Our sculpture creations are not only numerous but also rapidly improving in quality, with many excellent works emerging, such as "Monument to the People's Heroes," "Liu Hulan," "Hard Times," "Mother and Daughter Learning Culture," "Hiroshima Ten Years Festival," "Li Xiucheng Statue," "Long Live the People's Commune," "Splitting the Mountain to Make the Sea," the "Army, Navy, and Air Force," "Everyone a Soldier," at the Military Museum, "Five Rams of Guangzhou," "Fang La Statue," the colored sculpture "The East is Red," the ivory carving "Five Sons Make a Racket at the Harvest," the Qingtian stone carving "Giant Dragon of the East," the Dongyang wood carving "Nanchang Workers' Red Guards," etc., which are all very successful works.

Our sculpture team is constantly growing. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, very few people were engaged in sculpture work. Today, thanks to the attention of the Party and the government, more than 300 young sculptors have been trained from higher education institutions alone, plus even more young sculptors trained by folk artists and various sculpture factories and arts and crafts sculpture work. Many of the excellent works are created by young sculptors.

China's sculpture art once had a glorious page in history, but later gradually declined. By the time of the old Kuomintang China, it was dilapidated and withered, and sculptors had no way out. Those who had learned the trade changed professions, and later learners were discouraged. In the short period since liberation, sculpture work has developed so greatly, and there have been such great achievements in creation, which eloquently demonstrates that this is the great victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. Without the Party, it would have been absolutely impossible to achieve such success. But we must not be complacent. Sculpture work still cannot keep up with the rapidly developing situation of socialist construction and cannot meet the ever-increasing demands of the people. With the continued surge and huge development of the national economy, more and larger public buildings, parks, and squares will inevitably appear in the future, requiring the installation of sculptures; in order to commemorate the revolutionary history, commend revolutionary martyrs, and commemorate the great victory of socialist revolution and socialist construction, more monuments will be built in the future; our great era, with countless heroic figures and heroic deeds, is even more waiting for sculptors to eulogize. Therefore, the tasks that our sculptors will shoulder in the future are even greater and more glorious.

In order to better complete future sculpture tasks, we must make a thousandfold or hundredfold efforts.

First of all, our sculptors must resolutely implement the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving socialism, and serving communism. Every sculptor must work harder to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, go deep into the struggle of the masses, and become one with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, constantly transforming their own thoughts and feelings. Sculpture creation mainly shapes the typical image of heroic figures. In order to reflect the spirit of the times and the heroic character of heroic figures in the works, and to reveal the great spiritual world of heroic figures, we require sculptors to have a deep understanding of heroes, love heroes, and stand on the proletarian position to correctly reflect the spirit of heroes. If our thoughts and feelings lag behind reality, and we do not have an advanced worldview, we cannot correctly, deeply, and enthusiastically reflect the new era and express the spirit of new heroes. Or if we believe that the art form of sculpture cannot accommodate too many plots, cannot express the specific process of events, and that sculptors can be different from writers and do not need to have a deep understanding of things, thus neglecting political study, ideological transformation, and going deep into the life of the masses, and not caring enough or being interested in the great cause of socialist construction, that is completely wrong. Sculpture art requires a high degree of generalization and concentration in expressing themes and highlighting themes; but precisely because it requires a high degree of generalization and concentration, it requires sculptors to have advanced thinking, stand higher, see farther, and be more accurate, and to be more familiar with the lives of the working people, have more experience of the spirit of heroic figures, and love heroes more. If not, sculptors will lose their way in the complex phenomena of life. How can we accurately generalize and make the most glorious typical images? How can we recognize the noble qualities of heroic figures? Only when our sculpture creations correctly and profoundly express the spirit of revolutionary heroic figures can they truly move people. Therefore, in order to improve our creation, make our creation more exciting, and encourage the people to move forward, we must intensify our efforts to improve our thinking, go deep into the struggle of the masses, and transform our worldview.

Improving ideological awareness and transforming the worldview is a fundamental issue. For sculptors who have come from the old era, without exception, it is a problem that needs to be resolutely solved. For more than ten years, sculptors have been consciously carrying out self-transformation, going deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and have gained a lot in terms of ideology and professional skills. In the future, we still need to constantly leap forward in our thinking and understanding of life. On our road forward, we must resolutely fight against revisionism and all bourgeois ideas.

Under the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, sculpture has gained a rich and colorful broad creative world. Sculptors have made many efforts and achieved remarkable results in diversifying the forms, themes, and styles of sculpture under the requirements of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialist construction. For example, the four large reliefs in the Nationalities Palace are not only rich in content but also have their own unique styles. Folk sculptures, ivory carvings, etc., also show their brilliance in the process of development. In order to express the rich life content of the new society and adapt to the diverse needs of the people, in addition to ensuring the completion of commemorative creations that praise heroes and works that are educational for the people, decorative sculptures are also needed. Our era needs both large-scale sculptures and small-scale sculptures; both round sculptures and reliefs; both full-body statues and busts and head statues. It requires our sculptors to be proficient in one major and capable in many, and to be versatile, in order to meet the broad demands of the future. In addition to clay sculptures, stone carvings, and ivory carvings, other types such as wood carvings and ceramic sculptures should also be done more. At present, the quality of some of our ceramic sculpture handicrafts and small sculptures for desks and displays still needs to be improved. In particular, portraits of leaders are a work of great political significance, and regardless of size, they must be improved in level and created with a serious attitude. Under the unity of political direction and the diversity of artistic styles, the flower of sculpture will surely be even more brilliant and colorful.

How to better achieve the spirit of the times in sculpture, and to better nationalize and popularize it, is an important issue. In recent years, sculpture creation has made many achievements in these aspects. For example, the two sculptures "Long Live the People's Commune" in front of the Agricultural Exhibition Hall are good examples. These two sculptures are relatively successful in reflecting the spirit of the times and national style. In order to make our sculptures more loved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we must continue to work hard in this direction. Our era is a great era, and our people today are heroic people. We must praise our heroic figures, reflect the spirit of our times, better use the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, fully embody the great ideals of the proletarian revolution, express the great spirit of the working people, in order to educate the masses, inspire the masses to move forward, and promote social development.

To solve the problem of nationalization, we must solve the problem of inheriting the national sculpture heritage and folk sculpture. In the sculpture heritage of our motherland over the past dynasties, there are rich and excellent traditions, but also its feudal dross. According to the spirit of "discarding the dross and taking the essence," sculptors should devote themselves to drawing on and absorbing the essence of ancient sculpture in their creative practice, in order to help strengthen the expression of the revolutionary spirit and construction ambition of the people today; abandon those parts that are feudal and useless to our creation of socialist sculpture. For example, the "Fang La" statue is a good work created by absorbing the modeling and processing methods of ancient stone carvings. We must attach importance to and deeply study the sculpture heritage of our motherland. If there is an attitude of contempt for the national sculpture heritage, it will hinder us from recognizing and using the excellent traditions of the national sculpture heritage and folk sculpture. Contempt for national and folk sculpture is often inseparable from blind worship of Western sculpture heritage. Bowing down to the ancient Greek or European bourgeois sculptors, taking them as the goals to be pursued, for example, taking the French sculptor Rodin as an idol to worship, using his works to measure our sculpture, thinking that it is an insurmountable artistic peak, etc. We oppose this blind worship. We accept all foreign things that are beneficial to our building socialism, and we should accept the essence of our motherland's heritage even more. We do not sever tradition and abandon tradition; but we cannot stick to the old ways and follow the predecessors, we should "make the past serve the present" in order to create a new national sculpture of our socialist era.

How sculpture can be combined with the current political movement is also an important issue in the development of our sculpture art. As a tool for educating and inspiring the people, sculpture art has the responsibility to quickly reflect the current political movements that the people are most concerned about. During the Great Leap Forward, the "Splitting the Mountain to Make the Sea" created by the China Sculpture Factory, the "Ode to the Heroes of Makou" recently created by the Sculpture Research Class of the Central Academy of Fine Arts to reflect the Makou incident, and others such as "African Women" (Ding Jieyin) are all works that are timely combined with the current political movement. These works are welcomed by the masses and are of better quality. This proves that sculpture can quickly, well, and economically cooperate with the current political struggle in a timely manner. At present, the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and for the defense of world peace, and the struggle against colonialism and for national independence, are developing vigorously. Our sculptors should use our sculptural weapons in a timely manner to reflect these struggles, inspire the people of the world, and severely strike at imperialism. These types of works can adopt the form of small sculptures that are easy to move and exhibit, or be reproduced, so that they can be connected with more audiences.

Of course, for monument sculptures and sculptures that cooperate with architecture, a thorough plan should be made in advance as much as possible to give the author more time for creation. Because the requirements for the quality and form of these types of sculptures are different from those of general sculptures, they need to be treated differently. Ignoring this aspect is also wrong. However, we must never fail to reflect the current political movement in a timely manner and complete the works related to the political movement in a timely manner.

Finally, I would also like to mention the combination of architectural design and sculpture design. In the past, wherever attention was paid to this aspect, the cooperation effect of architecture and sculpture was better. In the future, more parks, squares, and high-rise buildings will need to be completed jointly by architects, sculptors, decorative artists, and painters. With the perfect coordination of architectural design and art works, our parks will be more beautiful, our squares will be better, and our high-rise buildings will be more magnificent. Therefore, under a unified plan, architecture and sculpture need to cooperate with each other, give play to each other's strengths, and achieve the effect of mutual brilliance.

    雕塑艺术发展中的几个问题
    刘开渠
    解放十年多来，我国雕塑事业有了很大的发展，取得了巨大的成绩。特别是大跃进以来，随着国民经济及各项事业的突飞猛进，雕塑事业的蓬勃气象，更是空前的。我们的雕塑创作，不仅是数量多，质量也提高得很快，出现了不少优秀的作品，如《人民英雄纪念碑》、《刘胡兰》、《艰苦岁月》、《母女学文化》、《广岛十年祭》、《李秀成像》、《人民公社万岁》、《劈山造海》、军事博物馆的《陆海空》、《全民皆兵》、《广州五羊石刻》、《方腊像》、彩雕《东方红》、牙雕《五子闹丰收》、青田石刻《东方巨龙》、东阳木雕《南昌工人纠察队》等等，都是很成功的作品。
    我们的雕塑队伍是不断地在壮大。国民党反动派统治时代，从事雕塑工作的人数极少。而今天由于党和政府的重视，仅从高等院校中，就培养了三百多青年雕塑工作者，加上由民间艺人及各雕塑工厂、工艺美术雕塑工作中培养出来的青年雕塑工作者，就更多了。很多的优秀作品，都是青年雕塑家创作的。
    我国的雕塑艺术，在历史上，曾有过光辉灿烂的一页，但后来日渐衰落，到国民党旧中国，已是破落雕零、奄奄一息，雕塑工作者苦无出路，真是学成的改行，后学者闻风却步。解放后短短的时期内，雕塑工作就有这样大的发展，在创作上有这样大的成就，就雄辩地说明了，这是毛泽东文艺思想的伟大胜利。如果离开了党，就绝不可能获得这样的成就。但我们决不自满。雕塑工作还赶不上社会主义建设迅速发展的形势需要，还不能满足人民群众日益提高的要求。随着不断高涨的国民经济的巨大发展，今后必然要出现更多更大的公共建筑、公园、广场，要求安装雕塑品；为了纪念革命历史，表彰革命先烈，为了纪念社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，今后将要建立更多的纪念碑；我们所处的伟大时代，无数的英雄人物与英雄事迹，更有待于雕塑家去歌颂。所以，我们雕塑工作者今后所担负的任务，是更巨大而光荣的。
    为了能更好地完成今后的雕塑任务，我们必须作千百倍的努力。
    首先，我们雕塑工作者今后必须坚决贯彻为工农兵服务、为社会主义、为共产主义服务的方向。每个雕塑工作者必须更加努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席的著作，深入群众斗争，和工农兵打成一片，不断改造自己的思想感情。雕塑创作，主要是塑造英雄人物的典型形象。为了在作品中反映时代精神与英雄人物的英雄性格，揭示英雄人物伟大的精神世界，就要求我们雕塑工作者能深刻地认识英雄，热爱英雄，站在无产阶级立场，正确反映英雄的精神。如果我们的思想感情落后于现实，自己没有先进的世界观，就不能正确、深刻、热情地反映出新的时代，表现出新英雄的精神。或者认为雕塑这一艺术形式，不能容纳太多的情节，不能表现事件的具体过程，雕塑家就可以不同于文学家，无须对事物有很深的认识，于是忽视政治学习、思想改造和深入群众生活，对于伟大的社会主义建设事业，关心不够或兴趣不大，那是完全错误的。雕塑艺术对于表现题材、突出主题是要求高度的概括与集中；但也正因为要求高度的概括和集中，就更要求雕塑工作者必须具备先进的思想，站得更高，看得更远、更准，要求更熟悉劳动人民生活，对英雄人物的精神有更多的体会，更加热爱英雄。如果不是这样，雕塑家在复杂的生活现象中，就会迷失方向。这样，如何能够准确地进行概括，作出最光辉的典型呢？如何能认识到英雄人物的高贵品质呢？我们的雕塑创作只有正确、深刻地表现出革命英雄人物的精神，才能真正地感动人。因此，为了提高我们的创作，使我们的创作更激动人心，鼓舞人民前进，我们必须加紧提高思想，深入群众斗争，改造世界观。
    提高思想觉悟，改造世界观，是一个根本问题。对于我们从旧时代过来的雕塑工作者说，无例外地是需要坚决解决的问题。十年多来，雕塑工作者已在自觉地进行自我改造，深入工农兵群众，在思想、业务上都有了很大的收获。今后在思想上和生活认识上，还需要不断地跃进。在我们前进的道路上，必须坚决和修正主义及一切资产阶级思想作斗争。
    在百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针下，雕塑得到了丰富多彩的广阔创作天地。雕塑工作者在为工农兵服务，为社会主义建设服务的要求下，在雕塑的形式、题材和风格的多样化上，做了很多的努力，有了显著的成绩。如民族宫的四块大浮雕，不但内容丰富，风格也各具特色。民间雕塑，象牙雕刻等，在发展的过程中也均呈异彩。为了能表现新社会的丰富生活内容，适应人民群众的多方面需要，在保证完成歌颂英雄的纪念性创作、对人民有教育意义的作品外，也需要装饰性的雕塑。我们的时代，既需要做大型的雕塑品，也要做小巧的雕塑品；既需要做圆雕，也要做浮雕；既需要做全身像，也要做胸像和头像。需要我们雕塑工作者一专多能，做多面手，才能满足今后的广泛要求。除了泥塑、石雕、象牙雕以外，其他如木雕、陶瓷雕塑也要多搞。目前我们有些陶瓷雕塑的工艺品和案头陈设的小型雕塑品，质量上还需要提高。特别是领袖肖像，这是一项具有重大政治意义的工作，不论大小，都必须提高水平，用严肃的态度来从事创作。在政治方向的一致性和艺术风格的多样性统一下，雕塑这一枝花，一定会更加灿烂多彩。
    在雕塑上更好地做到具有时代精神，更好地民族化、群众化，是个重要问题。近几年来，雕塑创作在这些方面，做出了不少的成绩。如农展馆前“人民公社万岁”两座雕塑，就是很好的例子。这两座雕塑在反映时代精神及民族气派上，都是比较成功的。为了使我们的雕塑品能更多地为工农兵所喜爱，我们还须循此方向继续努力。我们的时代是伟大的时代，我们今天的人民是英雄的人民。我们必须歌颂我们的英雄人物，反映我们的时代精神，更好地运用革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法，充分体现无产阶级革命的伟大理想，表现劳动人民的伟大气魄，以教育人民群众，鼓舞群众前进，推动社会向前发展。
    我们要解决民族化问题，必须解决对民族雕塑遗产、民间雕塑的继承问题。我们祖国历代雕塑遗产中，有丰富的优良传统，同时也有其封建性的糟粕。根据“去其糟粕、取其精华”的精神，雕塑工作者在创作实践中，应致力借鉴和吸收古代雕塑的精华部分，以帮助加强表现今天人民的革命精神和建设雄心；舍弃那些有封建性的、对我们创造社会主义雕塑无用的部分。如“方腊”像，就是吸收古代石刻的造型处理方法而创作出的一件好作品。我们必须重视和深入地研究祖国雕塑遗产。如果对民族雕塑遗产存在着轻视的态度，那就会阻碍我们认识、运用民族雕塑遗产、民间雕塑的优良传统。对民族、民间雕塑的轻视，往往同对西洋雕塑遗产的盲目崇拜分不开。拜倒在古希腊或欧洲资产阶级雕塑家的跟前，把他们作为自己追求达到的目标，比如说，把法国雕塑家罗丹当作偶像来崇拜，拿他的作品来衡量我们的雕塑，认为它是不可逾越的艺术高峰等等。我们反对这种盲目崇拜。我们接受对我们建设社会主义有益处的一切外国东西，我们更应该接受祖国遗产中的精华。我们不割断传统，抛弃传统；但也不能墨守成规，因袭前人，我们应当“古为今用”，以创造出我们社会主义时代的民族新雕塑。
    关于雕塑如何和当前政治运动相结合，也是我们雕塑艺术发展中的重要问题。雕塑艺术，作为教育、鼓舞人民的工具，有责任迅速反映人民最关心的当前政治运动。大跃进中，中国雕塑工厂创作的《劈山造海》，中央美术学院雕塑研究班最近为反映马口事件而创作的《马口英雄颂》，其他如《非洲妇女》（丁洁因）等，都是及时地和当前的政治运动相结合的作品。这些作品受到群众的欢迎，在质量上来说，也是较好的。这证明，雕塑是可以多快好省地及时配合当前政治斗争的。目前，全世界人民反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的斗争，反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的斗争，正在如火如荼地蓬勃开展。我们雕塑工作者，应该及时地用我们的雕塑武器，反映这些斗争，鼓舞全世界人民，狠狠地打击帝国主义。这类作品，可以采用移动展览方便的小型雕塑形式，或者复制，以便能够和更多的观众发生联系。
    当然，对于纪念碑雕塑及和建筑配合的雕塑，应尽可能事先有周密的计划，给作者以更多的创作时间。因为这类雕塑品，在质量和形式的要求上，和一般雕塑是有所不同的，需要有不同的对待。忽视这方面也是不对的。但是，我们绝不能因此而不及时地反映当前的政治运动，及时地完成与政治运动有关的作品。
    最后，我还想提到关于建筑设计和雕塑设计的结合问题。过去凡是在这方面注意得好的，建筑和雕塑的配合效果也就愈好。今后更多的公园、广场、高楼大厦，都是需要建筑家、雕塑家和装饰美术家、画家们共同去完成的。在建筑设计和美术作品的完美配合下，我们的公园会更美，广场会更好，高楼大厦会更加壮观。因此，需要在统一的计划下，建筑、雕塑相互配合，发挥彼此的长处，达到互相辉映的效果。
