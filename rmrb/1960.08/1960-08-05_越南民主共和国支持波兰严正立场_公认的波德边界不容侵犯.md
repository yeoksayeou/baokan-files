Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 3rd: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today, expressing its firm support for the solemn position expressed by the Government of the Polish People's Republic in its recent note to the governments of the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The statement pointed out that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the Polish western border along the Oder-Neisse line, which is recognized by the Potsdam Agreement and the Zgorzelec Agreement signed between the Polish People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic on July 6, 1950, and guaranteed by the Warsaw Treaty member states and all countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, is inviolable.

The statement pointed out that at present, with the encouragement and support of the North Atlantic military aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialism, West German militarism has been revived, and West Germany has become the most dangerous source of war in Europe. Under these circumstances, signing a peace treaty with Germany has become one of the most urgent issues that must be resolved in order to create conditions for eliminating this breeding ground of war, thereby easing tensions in Europe and internationally.

    越南民主共和国支持波兰严正立场
    公认的波德边界不容侵犯
    新华社河内3日电　越南民主共和国外交部今天发表声明，表示坚决支持波兰人民共和国政府最近在给北大西洋公约组织参加国各国政府的照会中所表明的严正立场。
    声明指出，越南民主共和国政府认为，得到波茨坦协定以及波兰人民共和国同德意志民主共和国1950年7月6日签订的高尔齐莱克协议承认，并得到华沙条约各参加国以及以苏联为首的社会主义阵营所有国家保证的波兰西部沿奥得—尼斯河的边界是不可侵犯的。
    声明指出，目前，在以美帝国主义为首的北大西洋军事侵略集团的鼓励和支持下，西德军国主义已经复活了，西德已经变成欧洲最危险的战争策源地。在这种情况下，签订对德和约已经成为必须解决的最迫切的问题之一，以便为消除这个战争温床，从而缓和欧洲和国际紧张局势创造条件。
