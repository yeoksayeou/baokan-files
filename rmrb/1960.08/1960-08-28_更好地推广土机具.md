    Better Promote Indigenous Implements
    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, our entire port's workforce created hundreds of indigenous machines to replace heavy manual labor and improve loading and unloading efficiency. We were extremely happy. Especially after seeing the indigenous chutes, which allowed us to transport goods without carrying or lifting, we wanted to use them. The first time, the whole group swarmed to move the chutes, lay them down, and after working for a long time, they were not easy to use, and the task was not completed. I thought to myself: dockworkers have been carrying on their shoulders for generations; what good are these indigenous chutes? I simply stopped using them.
    The Party branch discovered that we weren't using the indigenous chutes and told us that, like doing anything else, to get results from using indigenous implements, we must be patient and diligently learn and practice. After listening to the Party, we went to the site with the group's workers in our spare time to research and experiment: Under what circumstances should the chutes be laid out in what way? How to coordinate operations with foreign machinery? And so on. In less than a month, we gained many operational experiences in using indigenous chutes. Normally, it took half an hour to lay down a chute once, but our group only needed fifteen minutes. The adoption of indigenous chutes boosted the group's enthusiasm for using indigenous implements. Soon we also learned to use indigenous grabs, small indigenous cranes, etc., thus basically eliminating carrying on our shoulders, and greatly improving loading and unloading efficiency. Now, the work done by one person in our group is almost equivalent to the work done by one and a half people in the past. In the past, it took two hours to unload a wagon of magnesite; now, it only takes one hour and twenty minutes.
    We now deeply realize that, in order to transport the raw materials needed for steel production quickly and in large quantities, dockworkers must not only create new implements, but also promote new implements and use new implements well, so that new implements can play a greater role in loading and unloading work.

    更好地推广土机具
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，我们全港职工创造了数百种土机械，代替笨重的人力操作，提高装卸效率。我们高兴极了。特别见到土滑道，用它运货不扛不抬，就想用一用。头一回，全组一窝蜂地拥去搬滑道，铺滑道，弄了老半天，用起来不顺手，任务没完成。我心里想：码头工人祖祖辈辈就是肩扛人抬，凭这样土滑道能顶啥事，干脆不再用了。
    党支部发现我们不用土滑道，就告诉我们说，使用土机具和做别的事一样，想收到效果，一定要有耐心，勤学苦练。我们听了党的话，在业余时间，和小组工人一起到现场去研究试验：滑道在什么样的情况下要怎么铺？怎么样和洋机械配合作业？等等。不到一个月，就摸到了好多种运用土滑道的操作经验，一般铺滑道一次要半点钟，我们小组只要十五分钟。采用土滑道，鼓起了全组用土机具的劲头，不久又学会了使用土抓斗、小土吊等，因而基本消灭了肩扛人抬，装卸效率提高得很快，现在我们小组一个人干的活，差不多顶过去一个半人干的活。过去卸一车皮镁砂，一般要两小时，现在只要一小时零二十分钟。
    我们现在深深体会到：码头工人为了又快又多的把钢铁生产需要的原料材料运出去，不仅要创造新机具，同时还要推广新机具，用好新机具，使新机具在装卸工作中发挥更大的作用。
