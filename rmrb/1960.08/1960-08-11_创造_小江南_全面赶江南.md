Creating "Little Jiangnan" to Comprehensively Catch Up with Jiangnan

Chen Zonglie, First Secretary of the CPC Yancheng Prefectural Committee, Jiangsu Province

The mass movement in Yancheng Prefecture to "create 'Little Jiangnan' and comprehensively catch up with Jiangnan" is part of the mass movement in Jiangsu Province to "encourage Northern Jiangsu to catch up with Jiangnan, and for Jiangnan to reach new heights." It is the result of implementing the General Line, realizing the people's commune system, and achieving continuous leaps forward in production, as well as the long-standing wish and demand of the 4.8 million people in the Yancheng area.

	Determined to Catch Up with Jiangnan

Many people from Yancheng have been to Jiangnan. Before liberation, many farmers were "forced to leave their hoes and lacked food, fleeing to Jiangnan with mud-covered faces, returning like swallows in spring, enduring hardship and bitterness." Gangli Brigade of Dasheng Commune in Yancheng County was even called "Swallow's Nest" because of this. This made the people of Yancheng very familiar with Jiangnan, envied Jiangnan, and longed for Jiangnan.

However, at that time, Jiangnan was just an unattainable "paradise" in the eyes of the people of Yancheng. Only after liberation, especially in recent years, through socialist education and the tempering of the Great Leap Forward, have cadres and the masses strengthened their determination to follow the socialist road, developed the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, and successively produced high-yield models, with the strong organizational guarantee of the people's communes. Only then did they begin to break the superstition that "Jiangnan is unattainable," and arouse the desire and demand to catch up with Jiangnan. Based on the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, at the end of 1959, we put forward the slogan "Leap out of Yancheng to catch up with Jiangnan, and realize the Forty Articles ahead of schedule," taking the Suzhou Prefecture in Jiangnan, where grain and cotton yields were more than twice as high as ours, as a model to learn from, requiring that we approach it in one or two years, catch up in three or four years, and surpass it in five or six years.

The slogan of catching up with Jiangnan armed the cadres and masses with Comrade Mao Zedong's repeatedly taught idea of continuous revolution, breaking the thinking of some people who were satisfied with their current achievements and content with the status quo; it linked the Party's call to realize the Forty Articles ahead of schedule with the masses' inherent demands, using Jiangnan as a visualized goal. Therefore, this slogan was warmly welcomed by the masses as soon as it was put forward.

They said: "In the past, going to Jiangnan meant fleeing famine to beg for food; now, catching up with Jiangnan means completely turning over; in the future, once the door is opened, Jiangnan will be everywhere; the more we think about it, the happier we become, the more we want to work."

With 4.8 million people determined to catch up with Jiangnan, how exactly should we catch up? We need to solve a specific method and path.

	Using Points to Lead the Whole Area

The method we adopted is to create "Little Jiangnan" and comprehensively catch up with Jiangnan. This is mainly because the production foundations and conditions in various places are not exactly the same, and it is impossible for all places to catch up with Jiangnan at the same time. Only some areas can catch up first, then most areas catch up, and finally all areas catch up. Therefore, all localities should seize some units with a better foundation and conditions that can catch up with Jiangnan faster, cultivate and create "Little Jiangnan," let them catch up with Jiangnan first, and then drive the overall catch-up with Jiangnan; at the same time, they should also select some poor teams, focus on helping them to turn over, and create the experience of poor teams catching up with Jiangnan.

Currently, there are a total of 238 brigades (accounting for 7.5% of the total number of brigades), 4,990 production teams (accounting for 23.7% of the total number of production teams), and more than 2.4 million mu of land (accounting for 23.3% of the total cultivated area) being used by leaders at all levels for the "Little Jiangnan" pilot projects. This basically achieves the goal of the prefectural and county Party committees having "Little Jiangnan" areas of about 10,000 mu, communes having "Little Jiangnan" brigades, brigades having "Little Jiangnan" production teams, and production teams having 100 mu of "Little Jiangnan" fields.

At present, although the quality of "Little Jiangnan" varies from place to place, its unique role has become increasingly clear:

One, it has completed the layout for the entire prefecture to catch up with Jiangnan in stages and batches. The three levels of prefecture, county, and commune are all engaged in 10,000 mu of "Little Jiangnan" yielding 1,000 jin per mu, starting with 10,000 mu this year, and expanding year by year, catching up in stages and batches. Finally, the "Little Jiangnan" areas will be linked into large areas, gradually realizing the overall Jiangnanization.

Two, there are living examples of catching up with Jiangnan that are visible, tangible, easy to learn from, and smooth to catch up with, and confidence is also greatly increased. The masses said, "When we first proposed catching up with Jiangnan, we were really scared; after seeing 'Little Jiangnan,' our thinking has undergone a major change."

Three, it has become a demonstration base for implementing and promoting various technical measures. All measures are first implemented in "Little Jiangnan," experience is summarized in "Little Jiangnan," and meetings are held in "Little Jiangnan," watching, discussing, learning, and doing at the same time, making "Little Jiangnan" a site for liberating thoughts, a classroom for learning technology, and a venue for implementing work.

Four, it is closely combined with focusing on helping poor teams to turn over. Once some poor teams catch up with Jiangnan, other poor teams will also break superstitions and believe that "chicken feathers can fly to the sky"; communes and teams with production conditions superior to those of poor teams will work even harder to catch up.

Five, it promotes cadres at all levels to resolutely implement the leadership methods of combining the general with the individual, combining points with the whole area, and grasping both ends to lead the middle; and promotes imbalance through the creation of "Little Jiangnan," promotes new balance, and makes the movement rise step by step and advance steadily.

The first "Little Jiangnan" in the entire prefecture to be formally named after inspection and acceptance – the Erdu Brigade of Zhenghong Commune in Binhai County – had already transformed the winding ditches and rivers into a checkerboard-like river network, and the fragmented fields into neat and uniform strip fields during the Spring Festival this year. They also realized self-flowing irrigation and drainage, seed improvement, three mu of land for two pigs, two mu for a grass mud pond, and the planning of threshing grounds, cemeteries, greening, and residential areas closely followed. They raised the first red flag of catching up with Jiangnan in the entire prefecture. With one flag raised high, thousands of flags fluttered. The masses around Erdu came to learn, the cadres of communes and teams throughout Binhai County came to learn, and the communes and brigades throughout the prefecture are also working hard to learn from Erdu. All "Little Jiangnan" areas, like "locomotives," drove the train of comprehensively catching up with Jiangnan, speeding forward.

	Measures Must Keep Up

However, whether it is "Little Jiangnan" or a large area, to achieve yields that catch up with Jiangnan, the most fundamental condition is that the measures can keep up. As long as the measures can keep up, "when the melon is ripe, it falls off its stem, and when the water arrives, the canal is formed," and yields, output value, and the income of commune members will naturally gradually catch up.

Therefore, after proposing to catch up with Jiangnan, we specially took the first secretaries of the county Party committees and the main cadres of the prefecture and special departments to Suzhou for a study tour. We compared conditions with Suzhou, sorted out differences, found reasons, and proposed the task of catching up with Jiangnan item by item. We focused on long-term agricultural infrastructure construction and current technical innovations in production, carried out hierarchical planning, itemized requirements, and phased implementation, and actively created conditions for catching up with Jiangnan.

Among the measures to catch up with Jiangnan, we first focused on water, fertilizer, and soil. Since water conservancy is not as good as Suzhou, we vigorously promoted mechanized and electrical irrigation. Of the 4.1 million mu of rice, excluding more than 1 million mu of self-flowing irrigation, 60% has realized mechanized and electrical irrigation and drainage. Since fertilizer is not as good as Suzhou, we vigorously promoted the "three major components" of pig raising, grass mud ponds, and green manure. Now the entire prefecture has 1.4 million pigs, an average of one pig for every seven mu of land, more than double the same period last year. Suzhou's grass mud pond is famous for its wide source of fertilizer, simple method, and high fertilizer efficiency. After learning it, we have also achieved three mu per pond. Suzhou has more green manure, so we kept all the existing green manure for seed and strive to sow 2 million to 3 million mu of green manure this autumn, achieving one mu of green manure for every three to five mu of cultivated land. Since the soil quality is not as good as Suzhou, we have adopted various methods such as widespread planting of green manure, ditching to loosen alkali, covering with grass and storing grass, laying raw soil to replace soil, and diverting fresh water to wash away salt to improve saline-alkali soil.

Since the beginning of spring sowing and summer planting, we have seized key measures such as rational layout, selection of good seeds, timely and early sowing, sufficient base fertilizer application, rational close planting, and tool reform, and carried out a technical innovation movement to learn from Suzhou in crop cultivation and management. Most places have achieved the requirements of early action, fast action, new technology, and high quality. Now, we are also focusing on field management of autumn-ripe crops according to the standards of catching up with Jiangnan, and striving for a bumper harvest in the autumn.

The masses strongly agree with this approach, saying, "Work hard for a few years, and we guarantee we can catch up with Jiangnan!"

But some measures were taken a step too late. This has taught us that we must look several steps ahead when grasping production, not only spring active in winter dry, summer active ahead of time, and promoting autumn with summer, but also start preparing for next year's affairs now. At present, all localities have begun to pay attention to grasping the present with one hand and preparing for next year with the other, actively preparing for next year's crop layout, water conservancy, fertilizer, seeds, and other tasks, and striving for a better leap forward next year.

	Improving Cadre Style

In order to make the movement to catch up with Jiangnan deep, meticulous, and practical, we continue to promote the "three-thirds system" leadership method that has been effective for several years, that is, one-third of the cadres from the prefectural and county agencies go to the grassroots to work on pilot projects, one-third conduct inspections, and one-third stay in the agencies to handle daily work. In this way, more cadres can step out of the office and go to the front line of production. During the spring sowing and summer planting, more than 50,000 cadres at five levels twice met at the fields to inspect and promote progress. County and commune offices have moved to brigades and production teams to work. Cadres working in the fields, eating in the canteen, working in small teams, and holding meetings on site have begun to form a system.

The Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee have repeatedly instructed that the leap forward in production is closely linked to the leap forward in the ideological style of cadres. This is indeed the case. The movement to catch up with Jiangnan has promoted the leap forward in the style of cadres; and the leap forward in the style of cadres has promoted the continuous advancement of the movement to catch up with Jiangnan. Today, revisiting the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee feels especially cordial, and there is an urgent need to learn again from the beginning.

The movement to catch up with Jiangnan in Yancheng Prefecture is the product of continuous ideological revolution. From proposing the slogan of catching up with Jiangnan, to creating "Little Jiangnan," "catching up with Jiangnan item by item in production measures," "catching up with Jiangnan through technical innovation in crop cultivation and management," to the recently launched "red flag competition movement to catch up with Jiangnan," each step is connected and interconnected, and is also a process of continuous revolution and step-by-step improvement.

The initial achievements of catching up with Jiangnan are becoming more and more obvious. The total output of three wheat crops this year has increased compared to 1959; the autumn-ripe crops are growing luxuriantly, and as long as we are not paralyzed or relaxed in our thinking, and continue to process and cultivate, a bumper harvest is expected. All this is the result of the correct leadership of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, the result of the hard work of the broad masses, and the result of the selfless support of fraternal regions, especially Suzhou, Nantong, and Nanjing.

However, this year is only the first year of catching up with Jiangnan. At present, the development of the movement is still uneven. What has been done is only a small step forward on the basis of the past, which was relatively poor. We are determined to continue to follow the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, and in accordance with the spirit of continuous revolution, constantly push the movement forward.

    创造“小江南”全面赶江南
    中共江苏省盐城地委第一书记　陈宗烈
    盐城专区“创造‘小江南’，全面赶江南”的群众运动，是江苏全省“苏北鼓劲赶江南，江南更上一层楼”的群众运动的一部分，是贯彻执行总路线、实现人民公社化和生产持续跃进的结果，也是盐城地区四百八十万人民多年的愿望和要求。
        立志赶江南
    盐城人民到过江南的很多。解放前，很多农民都是“丢了刀杆断了粮，泥门江南去逃荒，秋去春回如燕鸟，口咬黄连苦难当”。盐城县大胜公社的冈利大队，就曾因此被称为“燕子窝”。这就使得盐城人民非常熟悉江南，羡慕江南，向往江南。
    可是，那时候，江南在盐城人民的心目中，不过是一个可望而不可即的“天堂”。只有在解放后，特别是近几年来，经过社会主义教育和大跃进的锻炼，干部群众坚定了走社会主义道路的决心，发扬了敢想敢做的共产主义风格，高产典型陆续出现，又有人民公社坚强组织的保证，才开始破除“江南高不可攀”的迷信，激起赶江南的愿望和要求。我们根据省委的指示，于1959年底，提出了“跳出盐城赶江南，提前实现四十条”的口号，把粮棉产量比我们高出一倍以上的江南苏州专区，作为学习的榜样，要求一、二年接近，三、四年赶上，五、六年超过。
    赶江南的口号，是用毛泽东同志一再教导我们的不断革命的思想，武装了干部群众，打破了一些人满足于现有成就，安于现状的思想；以江南这个形象化了的目标，把党的提前实现四十条的号召，同群众的内在要求联系到一起。所以这个口号一经提出，就得到群众的热烈响应。
    他们说：“过去去江南，逃荒去讨饭；如今赶江南，彻底把身翻；将来门一开，处处是江南；越想越高兴，越干越要干。”
    四百八十万人民立志赶江南，究竟怎样赶法？需要解决一个具体方法和道路问题。
    以点带面
    我们采取的方法，是创造“小江南”，全面赶江南。这主要是考虑到各地的生产基础和条件不尽相同，不可能都在同一时间内赶上江南，只能先有局部地区赶上，而后大部分地区赶上，最后全面赶上。因此，各地都抓住一些基础、条件比较好，可以较快地赶上江南的单位，培养创造“小江南”，让他们首先赶上江南，然后带动全面赶江南；同时也选择一部分穷队，重点帮助他们翻身，创造穷队赶江南的经验。
    现在，各级领导正在创造的“小江南”试点，共有二百三十八个大队（占大队总数7.5％）、四千九百九十个生产队（占生产队总数23.7％）、二百四十多万亩田（占耕地总面积23.3％），基本上做到了地、县委有万亩左右的“小江南”片，公社有“小江南”大队，大队有“小江南”生产队，生产队有百亩“小江南”田。
    目前，尽管各地“小江南”的质量还有高有低，但是它的特有作用，已经越来越清楚地表现出来：
    一、完成了全专区分期分批赶江南的布局。地、县、社三级都搞万亩千斤“小江南”，今年先搞一万亩，以后年年扩大，分期分批地赶。最后把“小江南”联成大片，逐步实现全面江南化。
    二、赶江南有了活榜样，看得见，摸得着，学起来方便，赶起来也顺当，信心也更加提高了。群众说，“才提赶江南，心里真胆寒；看了‘小江南’，思想大转弯。”
    三、成为贯彻和推广各项技术措施的示范基地。一切措施先从“小江南”做起，经验到“小江南”总结，会议到“小江南”召开，边看边议，边学边做，使“小江南”成为解放思想的现场，学习技术的课堂，贯彻工作的会场。
    四、同重点帮助穷队翻身紧密结合。一部分穷队赶上了江南，其他穷队也就会破除迷信，确信“鸡毛能上天”；生产条件优于穷队的社、队，更要发奋图强，迎头赶上。
    五、推动各级干部坚决执行一般与个别相结合，点与面相结合，抓两头带中间的领导方法；并且通过创造“小江南”创造不平衡，促进新平衡，使运动步步高涨，节节前进。
    全专区第一个经过检查验收、正式命名的“小江南”——滨海县正洪公社二渡大队，他们早在今年春节期间，就把弯曲的沟河搞成棋盘格似的河网，把鸡零狗碎的田块搞成整齐划一的条田，并且实现了灌排自流化，种籽良种化，三亩两头猪，二亩一个草泥塘，打谷场、公墓、绿化和居民点的规划也紧紧跟上，在全专区树起了赶江南的第一面红旗。一旗高举万旗飘，二渡周围的群众跑来学，滨海全县的社队干部跑来学，全专区的公社和大队也都在努力向二渡看齐。所有“小江南”像“火车头”一样，带动了全面赶江南的列车，向前急驰。
    措施紧跟上
    但是，不论“小江南”还是大面积，要得产量赶江南，最根本的条件，还是要措施能赶上。只要措施能赶上，“瓜熟蒂落，水到渠成”，产量、产值和社员收入，自然会逐步赶上。
    因此，在提出赶江南以后，我们特地把各县委第一书记和地、专各部门的主要干部，带到苏州参观学习。同苏州比条件，排差异，找原因，提出逐项措施赶江南的任务。抓住长远的农业基本建设和当前生产上的技术革新，进行分级规划，分项要求，分期实现，积极为赶江南创造条件。
    我们在赶江南的措施中，首先狠抓水、肥、土。水利不如苏州，我们就大搞机电灌溉。四百一十万亩水稻，除去一百多万亩自流灌溉，其余有60％实现了灌排机电化。肥料不如苏州，我们就大抓养猪、草塘泥、绿肥“三大件”。现在全专区已有生猪一百四十万头，平均七亩多田一头，比去年同期增长一倍多。苏州的草塘泥，以肥源广、办法省、肥效高著名，我们学了回来，也已做到三亩一塘。苏州绿肥比较多，我们就把现有绿肥全部留种，力争今年秋播绿肥二百到三百万亩，达到每三亩到五亩耕地就有一亩绿肥。土质不如苏州，我们就采取广种绿肥、开沟爽碱、盖草窖草、铺生换土、引淡洗盐等多种办法，进行改良盐碱土的工作。
    春播夏种开始，又抓住合理布局、选用良种、适时早播、施足基肥、合理密植、工具改革等关键措施，在作物栽培管理方面，开展学习苏州的技术革新运动。多数地方实现了动手早、行动快、技术新、质量高的要求。现在，又在按照赶江南的规格，狠抓秋熟作物田间管理，力夺秋熟大丰收。
    群众很赞成这样做，他们说：“扎扎实实干几年，保证江南能赶上！”
    但有些措施还嫌抓得迟了一步。这就教育我们：抓生产一定要走一步看几步，不但要春活冬干，夏活提前，以夏促秋，而且要明年的事，现在就动手准备。目前各地已经开始注意一手抓当前，一手抓来年，积极进行明年生产的作物布局、水利、肥料、种籽等准备工作，争取明年更好的跃进。
    改进干部作风
    为了使赶江南运动搞得深入细致踏实，我们继续推行几年来行之有效的“三三制”的领导方法，即地、县机关抽出三分之一的干部到基层搞点，三分之一巡回检查，三分之一留机关处理日常工作，这样，就有更多的干部走出了办公室，深入生产第一线。春播夏种期间，五级干部五万余人两度会师田头，检查促进。县、社办公室纷纷搬到大队、生产队去办公。干部劳动到田头，吃饭上食堂，工作在小队，会议在现场，开始形成制度。
    中央和省委一再指示：生产的跃进同干部思想作风的跃进是紧密地联系在一起的。事实正是这样。赶江南运动促进了干部作风的跃进；干部作风的跃进，又推动了赶江南运动不断向前。今天重温中央和省委的指示，感到格外亲切，迫切需要重头学起。
    盐城专区的赶江南运动，是思想不断革命的产物。从提出赶江南的口号，到创造“小江南”、“生产措施逐项赶江南”、“农作物栽培管理技术革新赶江南”，直到最近正在开展的
  “赶江南红旗评比竞赛运动”，前后衔接，环环相套，也是一个不断革命、步步提高的过程。
    赶江南的初步成效越来越明显了。今年三麦总产量比1959年增加；秋熟作物生长茂盛，只要思想不麻痹、不松懈，继续加工培育，丰收有望。这一切都是中央、省委正确领导的结果，是广大群众艰苦奋斗的结果，也是兄弟地区，特别是苏州、南通、南京等地无私支援的结果。
    但是，今年还只是赶江南的第一年。目前运动的发展还不平衡。已经做了的事情，不过是在过去比较差的基础上前进了一小步。我们决心继续遵循中央和省委的指示，按照不断革命的精神，不断把运动推向前进。
