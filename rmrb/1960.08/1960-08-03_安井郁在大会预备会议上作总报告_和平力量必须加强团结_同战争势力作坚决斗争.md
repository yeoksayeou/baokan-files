Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd. Yasui Kaoru, director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, delivered a general report today at the preparatory meeting of the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament.

	Yasui Kaoru said that this conference should be called a "fighting world conference."

	Yasui Kaoru emphasized that at this world conference, we should establish a policy for peace forces to wage a common struggle against war forces, and through struggle, open the way to the prohibition of nuclear weapons, general disarmament, and peaceful coexistence.

	He pointed out that in the past year, peace forces have developed significantly, and peace movements and national independence movements are achieving victories. Socialist countries adhering to a peaceful policy have formed a strong peace force with Asian, African, and Latin American countries that have achieved or are achieving independence. Peace movements in capitalist countries such as the United States and Britain are also strengthening. In South Korea and Turkey, Syngman Rhee and Menderes, who have pursued the war policies of U.S. imperialism for many years, have been overthrown by the people.

	Yasui Kaoru emphasized that since last year, Japan's peace movement has focused on opposing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." At the same time, the struggle against the new "Security Treaty" was combined with the struggle against the dictatorial politics of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the struggle to defend democracy, and it was carried out on an unprecedented scale and intensity. People who had always remained silent also stood up and participated in demonstrations and various protests. Large-scale political strikes by organized workers and the courageous actions of students are the main force of this struggle.

	Yasui Kaoru pointed out that this struggle, which brings together all the peace forces in Japan, has achieved several important accomplishments: it prevented Eisenhower from visiting Japan; it forced Kishi Nobusuke to step down; and it dealt a heavy blow to the plan to strengthen the military alliance in the Far East through the new "Security Treaty."

	He said that the Japanese people have learned through personal experience the lesson of distinguishing between friends and enemies. We must wage a resolute struggle against the forces that pursue militarist and "Cold War" policies. Peace cannot be won without fighting against the forces of war.

	Yasui pointed out that the four-power summit conference was undermined by the U.S. war forces that continued to wage the "Cold War."

	Yasui emphasized that now, in order to completely overwhelm the enemy of peace – the forces of war – the world peace movement must resolutely unite and further strengthen the struggle. Only by waging a tit-for-tat struggle against the enemy is it possible to realize humanity's desire for the prohibition of nuclear weapons, general disarmament, and peaceful coexistence.

	Yasui Kaoru said that the movement policy of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is based on the above viewpoints. According to this movement policy, the Council held a 10,000-kilometer peace march from Okinawa in the south to Hokkaido in the north, heading towards Tokyo, from April 21 to August 5 this year. This peace march is the largest in history, and its characteristic is that it passed through U.S. military bases and Japanese "Self-Defense Force" bases throughout Japan and launched protest activities. Through these activities, the peace march has become a large-scale demonstration against militarism. The peace march has set off a wave of mass demands for peace in the various cities and towns it has passed through and is gathering new peace forces.

	Yasui Kaoru pointed out that the basic task of the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament is to envision all the topics under the premise of a "fighting world conference." He said that as the world peace movement and the national independence movement are advancing, the Japanese people have also accumulated tremendous strength in the struggle against the "Security Treaty" and in defense of democracy. The Council believes that this tremendous force must be reflected in the world conference and further developed.

	Yasui emphasized that the participation of Chinese representatives makes this conference even more significant. China has consistently supported the Japanese movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs and the world conference. However, due to the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's hostile policy towards China, China has not been able to send representatives to the past two world conferences. This is the first time in three years that an invitation to Chinese representatives to participate in the world conference has been realized, and we feel infinitely happy.

	Yasui pointed out that China's sending of representatives to participate in the world conference shows that the Chinese people are willing to conduct a common struggle with the Japanese people for peace. In order to live up to this intention, we, the Japanese people, are willing to express our determination to make every effort to build a peaceful Japan that does not antagonize China.

	Yasui said that if the representatives of various countries in the world and all the Japanese representatives can reach a consensus at this year's world conference, this will be able to make a great contribution to world peace.

	Yasui Kaoru finally emphasized that truth and justice are on the side of our people. The direction we are taking is in line with the laws of historical development. Our struggle will surely overcome all difficulties and obstacles and achieve a glorious victory.

    和平力量必须加强团结  同战争势力作坚决斗争
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁今天在第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会预备会议上作了总报告。
    安井郁说，这次大会应该叫做“战斗的世界大会”。
    安井郁强调指出，我们要在这次世界大会上确立和平力量对战争势力进行共同斗争的方针，并且通过斗争开辟通往禁止核武器和全面裁军以及和平共处的道路。
    他指出，一年来和平力量有了显著的发展，和平运动和民族独立运动正在取得胜利。坚持和平政策的社会主义各国同已经或正在取得独立的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国结成了强大的和平力量。美国和英国等资本主义各国的和平运动也在加强。在南朝鲜和土耳其，多年来奉行美帝国主义战争政策的李承晚和曼德列斯已经被人民赶下了台。
    安井郁强调指出，去年以来日本的和平运动集中在反对新日美“安全条约”这一点上。同时，反对新“安全条约”的斗争和反对岸信介内阁独裁政治、维护民主的斗争结合起来，并且以空前未有的规模和强度进行着。过去一向保持沉默的人们也站起来参加了示威游行和各种抗议行动。组织起来的工人的大规模政治罢工和学生勇敢的行动是这个斗争的主力。
    安井郁指出，汇集全体日本和平力量的这个斗争取得了几项重要的成就：阻止了艾森豪威尔访日；把岸信介赶下了台；沉重地打击了通过新“安全条约”来加强远东军事同盟的计划。
    他说，日本人民通过切身经验学到了应该把朋友和敌人区别出来的教训。对进行军国主义政策和“冷战”政策的势力，我们必须进行坚决的斗争。不对战争势力进行斗争，和平是不能争取的。
    安井指出，四国首脑会议被继续进行“冷战”的美国战争势力所破坏。
    安井强调指出，现在为了完全压倒和平的敌人——战争势力，世界和平运动必须坚决团结起来进一步加强斗争。只有对敌人进行针锋相对的斗争，才有可能实现人类所渴望的禁止核武器和全面裁军以及和平共处。
    安井郁说，日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会的运动方针就建立在上述观点的基础上。根据这项运动方针，协议会举行了从今年4月21日起到8月5日为止的南起冲绳北起北海道的向东京进发的一万公里和平大游行。这次和平大游行是有史以来规模最大的一次，它的特点在于路过日本全国的美军基地和日本“自卫队”基地并展开抗议活动。通过这些活动，和平大游行已经成为反对军国主义的大示威。和平大游行在它所路过的各个城乡掀起了群众要求和平的浪潮并汇集着新的和平力量。
    安井郁指出，第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的基本任务是在“战斗的世界大会”的前提下设想所有的议题。他说，在全世界和平运动和民族独立运动在前进中，日本人民也在反对“安全条约”、维护民主的斗争中积累了巨大的力量。协议会认为必须把这种巨大力量反映到世界大会上并进一步使它发展。
    安井强调指出，中国代表的参加使这次大会更加具有重要意义。中国一贯支持日本禁止原子弹氢弹运动和世界大会，然而由于岸信介内阁的敌视中国政策，过去两次世界大会中国都没有能派遣代表前来参加。这是三年来第一次实现邀请中国代表参加世界大会，我们感到无限的高兴。
    安井指出，中国派遣代表参加世界大会表明中国人民愿意同日本人民为争取和平而进行共同斗争。为了不辜负这种心意，我们日本人民愿意表明以全力为建立不敌视中国的和平日本而努力。
    安井说，如果在今年世界大会上世界各国代表和全体日本代表能够取得一致意见，这将能够对世界和平作出巨大贡献。
    安井郁最后强调指出，真理和正义在我们人民这一方面。我们所走的方向是合乎历史发展规律的。我们的斗争一定能够克服一切困难和障碍取得辉煌的胜利。
