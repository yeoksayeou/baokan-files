Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: In order to prepare for the new school year's teaching work, many provinces and cities across the country are utilizing part of the summer vacation to organize full-time school teachers for further studies. Agricultural middle school teachers in areas such as Shaanxi, Shanghai, and Yangzhou, Jiangsu, as well as vocational and spare-time school teachers in Shanghai, have also largely participated in summer further education. According to incomplete statistics from Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces, and Tianjin and Shenyang cities, the number of primary and secondary school teachers participating in further studies exceeds 420,000. Currently, some teachers are still studying, while others have already returned to their schools after graduation to begin preparations for the new school year's teaching.

The further studies for teachers in various regions follow the principle of combining work and rest. They usually begin in batches after a certain rest period following the school's summer vacation, with the duration generally being only about two weeks. These studies balance work and leisure, combining learning with recreational activities, and employing a variety of methods. Many regions are running summer teacher training sessions, research classes, training courses, and radio and correspondence schools. Hubei and other provinces are dispatching faculty members from colleges and universities to form lecturer groups, combining visits and lectures for secondary schools in various locations. Shanghai is holding six special lectures on mathematics, chemistry, physics, and biology, as well as a Russian language learning class, to help university teachers of basic courses improve their professional level. Various regions are also organizing teacher further education under the unified leadership of the Party committee, implementing a top-down approach with responsibility at each level. Generally, the provincial level is responsible for organizing further education for teachers of universities, senior high schools, and intermediate normal schools, while the further education work for junior high school, junior normal school teachers, and primary school teachers and kindergarten educators is the responsibility of special districts and counties/communes, respectively.

The content of further education ranges from politics to professional skills, combining political awareness and professional competence. Various regions have arranged rich and varied teaching and research activities for the participating teachers, following the principle of teaching what is being taught, learning what needs to be learned, identifying what is lacking, and supplementing what is needed, which has been warmly welcomed by the teachers. Teachers' participation in further education is closely integrated with actual teaching. In many regions, teachers are delving into factories and rural areas during their studies, combining visits with research on teaching materials and methods. Teachers from Shanghai's spare-time schools participating in training, when summarizing and exchanging experiences in teaching reform, conduct in-depth investigations and research in workshops and sections, formulate teaching reform plans, compile new teaching materials or supplementary materials, produce new teaching aids, and experiment with new teaching methods, thereby greatly improving the level of the teachers.

Party committees in various regions attach great importance to teacher further education, assigning responsible cadres to lead this work, preparing a good learning environment for the teachers, rationally arranging their lives, and organizing certain visits and recreational activities. They also organize cooperation from various aspects to equip the participating teachers with excellent lecturers and tutors.

    教什么　学什么　缺什么　补什么
    各地教师积极进修迎接新学年
    据新华社27日讯　为了迎接新学年的教学工作，全国许多省、市利用暑假一部分时间组织全日制学校教师进修。陕西、上海、江苏扬州等地的农业中学教师，上海市的职工业余学校教师也大部分参加了暑期进修。据山东、山西、陕西三省和天津、沈阳两市不完全统计，参加进修的中小学教师即有四十二万多人。目前，教师们有的还在学习，有的已在结业后回到学校开始新学年的教学准备工作。
    各地教师进修，都是根据劳逸结合的原则，在学校放暑假后经过一定休息时间分批开始的，时间一般只有两周左右。进修中也有劳有逸，既学习又有文娱活动，进修方式也多种多样。许多地区开办暑期教师讲习会、研究班、训练班和广播学校、函授学校等；湖北等省抽调一部分大专学校教职员组成讲师团，结合参观访问赴各地为中等学校讲学；上海市举办数学、化学、物理、生物等六个专题讲座和一个俄语学习班，帮助高等学校基础课教师提高业务水平。各地还在党委统一领导下实行上下结合，分级负责的办法组织教师进修。一般是省级负责组织高等学校和高级中学、中级师范教师进修，初级中学、初级师范教师和小学教师、幼儿园教养员的进修工作分别由专区和县、社负责。
    进修内容从政治到业务，政治和业务相结合。各地都按照教什么学什么、缺什么补什么的原则，为参加进修的教师安排了丰富多彩的教学研究活动，受到教师们的热烈欢迎。教师们参加进修，都是和教学实际密切结合的。许多地区的教师在进修中深入工厂、农村，结合参观访问对教材和教学方法作了研究。上海市业余学校参加培训的教师，在总结和交流教学改革经验时，深入车间、工段，进行调查研究，制订教学改革方案，编写新教材或补充教材，制作新教具，试验新的教学方法，从而大大地提高了教师们的水平。
    各地党委对于教师进修极为重视，分别派负责干部领导这一工作，为教师们准备了良好的进修环境，合理地安排了生活，组织一定的参观访问和文娱活动。还组织各方面协作，为参加进修的教师们配备优秀的讲师和辅导员。
