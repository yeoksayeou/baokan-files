Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 18th: President Sukarno of Indonesia issued Presidential Decrees No. 200 and No. 201 on the 17th, formally announcing the dissolution of the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party.

Presidential Decree No. 200, dissolving the Masyumi Party, stated, "For the benefit of the nation and the people, it is necessary to dissolve the Masyumi Party because it engaged in rebellious activities, namely, its leaders participated in the rebellion of the 'Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia' (also known as the 'United Republic of Indonesia'); and the party failed to condemn the actions of its leaders, which clearly provided assistance to the rebellion." Therefore, it was decided that the Masyumi Party and its branches throughout the country should be dissolved. This decision takes effect immediately.

Presidential Decree No. 201, dissolving the Indonesian Socialist Party, is the same as the decision to dissolve the Masyumi Party.

    印度尼西亚总统苏加诺正式宣布
    解散马斯友美党和社会党
    新华社雅加达18日电　苏加诺总统17日发布第二百号和二百零一号总统决定，正式宣布解散马斯友美党和印度尼西亚社会党。
    解散马斯友美党的第二百号总统决定说，“为了国家和民族的利益，有必要解散马斯友美党，因为它进行了叛乱活动，即它的领袖参加了‘印度尼西亚共和国革命政府’（又名“印度尼西亚统一共和国”）的叛乱；而这个党没有能够谴责它的领袖们的行动，这显然对叛乱提供了帮助。”因此决定，马斯友美党及其在全国各地的支部应该解散。这项决定自即日起生效。
    解散印度尼西亚社会党的第二百零一号总统决定，同解散马斯友美党的决定是一样的。
