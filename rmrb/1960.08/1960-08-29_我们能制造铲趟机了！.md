We Can Now Manufacture Row Crop Cultivators!
    One day, I went to the Victory Brigade, and on the way, I met Tian Dehe and three other commune members. They were watering their livestock while using the row crop cultivator we produced.
    "Director Ma, where did you buy this gadget?" Old Tian asked, pointing to the row crop cultivator.
    "It wasn't bought. It was manufactured by our own factory," I replied.
    "Our small repair shop can manufacture this?" Old Tian asked with some doubt. I nodded affirmatively and said, "It's manufactured by our commune's farm tool factory." The three commune members who heard this all gathered around to ask about the manufacturing process. After hearing about it, everyone was very excited.
    Indeed, when we first established the People's Commune, we set up a farm tool repair shop, but at that time, there were only thirty or forty metal and wood workers, making sickles and hoe blades around a small stove, all by hand. At the beginning of this year, the worker brothers from the Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, responding to the Party's call, came to support our commune in agricultural technical transformation. They taught us techniques, helped us install machines, and so on. With their enthusiastic help, our metal and wood workers have begun using machinery and improved their skills. Now, we can not only make row crop cultivators, but also manufacture twenty-three kinds of agricultural implements such as threshers, winnowers, and weeding machines. General agricultural machinery problems can be repaired within the commune.
    Our self-repair and manufacture of new farm tools has played a great role in promoting agricultural production. Since the beginning of this year, we have used new farm tools, saving tens of thousands of man-days, greatly speeding up the sowing progress, and completing the row crop cultivation task ahead of schedule.

     我们能制造铲趟机了！
    一天，我到胜利大队去，半路上遇到田德和另外三名社员。他们正?喝着牲口，在使用我们生产的铲趟机。
    “马厂长，这玩艺是从哪儿买来的？”老田指着铲趟机问我。
    “不是买来的。是咱厂子里自己制造的。”我回答道。
    “我们这个小修配厂能制造吗？”老田半信半疑地问。我肯定地点点头说：“是咱们公社农具厂制造的。”那三名社员听我这一说，也都围过来问制造的经过。听了之后，大家都很激动。
    可不是，当我们刚成立人民公社时，就建立了农具修配厂，但那时候只有三、四十名铁、木工，围着小烘炉打个镰刀、锄板，全是手工操作。今年年初，沈阳机车车辆厂的工人兄弟，响应党的号召，来支援我们公社进行农业技术改造。他们教我们技术，帮助我们安装机器，等等。在他们的热心帮助下，我们的铁、木工人用上了机械，提高了技术。现在，我们不但会做铲趟机，还能制造脱谷机、扬场机、打稻机、锄草机等二十三种农业机具。一般的农业机械有毛病，可做到中、小修不出社。
    我们自己修配和制造新农具，对促进农业生产起了很大的作用。今年以来，我们使用新农具，已节省了上万个人工，大大加快了播种进度，提前完成了铲趟任务。
