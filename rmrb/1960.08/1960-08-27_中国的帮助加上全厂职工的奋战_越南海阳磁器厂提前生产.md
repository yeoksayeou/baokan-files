Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Dispatch: According to reports in local newspapers, the large-scale Hai Duong Ceramic Factory, built with Chinese assistance, successfully test-produced its first batch of products at noon on the 20th, ahead of schedule. This is a precious gift from all the factory's workers, dedicated to the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Third National Congress of the Vietnam Workers' Party.

This batch of products includes eight varieties, totaling more than 1,300 pieces. Among them are specially made teacups for the Labor Party Congress, with good texture and a smooth, white surface, fully meeting the specifications.

On the afternoon of the 20th, the factory held a ceremony to celebrate the successful firing of the first batch of products, and more than 40 male and female workers who achieved outstanding results in the labor competition were rewarded.

Construction of the Hai Duong Ceramic Factory began in June 1959. In order to produce the first batch of products before the Labor Party Congress convened on September 5, all factory workers launched a 100-day hard work competition in May this year. They sped up construction, installed machinery, and prepared for production simultaneously. As a result, they produced the first batch of products in 90 days of hard work. Now, the workers are continuing to redouble their efforts, striving to produce two more batches of products by the time of the "September 2nd" National Day.

    中国的帮助加上全厂职工的奋战
    越南海阳磁器厂提前生产
    新华社河内电　据此间报纸报道：由中国帮助建设的规模宏大的海阳磁器厂，20日中午提前试行生产了第一批产品。这是全厂职工艰苦奋战，向越南民主共和国建国十五周年和越南劳动党的第三次代表大会献上的珍贵礼物。
    这批产品包括八个品种，共一千三百多件。其中有特制送给劳动党代表大会的茶杯，磁质良好，磁面光滑洁白，完全合乎规格。
    20日下午，这个工厂举行了庆祝第一批产品成功出窑的仪式，四十多个在劳动竞赛中成绩卓著的男女工人获得了奖励。
    海阳磁器厂是1959年6月施工的。为了争取在劳动党代表大会在9月5日召开以前生产第一批产品，今年5月间全厂职工发起了苦战一百天的竞赛运动。他们一面加快施工，一面安装机器，一面准备生产。结果苦战九十天，就生产出第一批产品。现在，职工们正在继续加倍努力，争取在“九二”国庆到来的时候，再生产两批产品。
