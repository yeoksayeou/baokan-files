    Amateur Literary and Art Soldiers
    Write Your Own Songs
    Wang Dianhuai, a lathe operator from a machinery factory in Northeast China and the composer of the music for Chairman Mao's poem "Lou Shan Pass," is attending the Literary Congress this time.

    Wang Dianhuai, a twenty-three-year-old member of the Communist Youth League, never dreamed he would compose music. He only had six years of schooling before entering the factory. In his spare time, he often sang with some young friends. Once, the Party branch secretary said, "When can we turn our own stories into songs?" This gave Wang Dianhuai great inspiration. He thought, "Musicians aren't born that way." So he bought booklets about composition, read music magazines, and practiced musical notation. When he wrote his first song, "Fighting in the Workshop," and sang it to the workers, everyone was not satisfied and offered many suggestions, encouraging him to continue creating. After hard work, his later creations, such as "One Day Equals Twenty Years" and "Great Effort for One Hundred and Twenty Days," were well-received. The factory Party committee and the Liaoning Provincial Music Association discovered him and helped him improve his musical talent, finally enabling him to compose music for Chairman Mao's poem.

    Farmer Painter
    Sitting in front of us is a shy and simple young man. He comes from Jiangsu Province's Pi County, a nationally renowned home of poetry and painting, and is a farmer painter named Liang Chuankui. This young farmer excitedly talked about his journey to becoming a farmer painter.

    Once, Liang Chuankui saw a cartoon on a neighbor's village wall called "Old Yellow Ox Complaint," which humorously and vividly criticized the breeder, and became interested in painting. Soon, the province opened an art training class, and he was sent to study. He could understand the principles of art serving politics taught by the teachers, but he couldn't understand perspective, composition, and other principles. So he studied hard and diligently, and by the time he graduated from the training class, he had a preliminary grasp of this knowledge. When he returned to his township, he painted his first mural, "Worker-Peasant Alliance," on the whitewashed walls. When the surrounding villagers saw that Liang Chuankui had painted what everyone wanted to say, they were even happier than Liang Chuankui and came to help. Liang Chuankui felt that there was strength in numbers, so he taught everyone the techniques of painting. Soon, dozens of amateur art groups were established in this commune.

    Under the leadership of the commune Party secretary, the art groups developed from copying to creating. During the day, they turned what they saw, thought, and talked about while working in the fields into drafts at night. After evaluation and modification, they were painted on the walls. In less than two months, more than nine hundred murals loved by the masses appeared in this commune, making it the first mural township in the county.

    Lieutenant Poet
    At a get-together held by representatives of folk literature and art circles, we met Rao Jiebasang, a young Tibetan amateur poet who is now a lieutenant in the People's Liberation Army. He can not only spontaneously compose poems, but also sing and dance. At the party, he played the stringed instrument, danced ethnic dances, and sang newly composed folk songs: "Broad bean flowers bloom everywhere, if you ask how beautiful my life is, please look at how bright the broad bean flowers are..."

    Rao Jiebasang's youth was spent under the whips and scoldings of serf owners. Since childhood, he worked as a handyman in the home of a "headman" and also farmed the land himself. In 1951, when the People's Liberation Army first arrived in Tibet, he escaped from his cage under the pretext of going home to see his father and joined the army. After joining the army, he worked as a scout, propagandist, and also fought battles. In 1955, he wrote his first poem, "Green Ocean," singing about the Han cadres' enthusiastic help to the Tibetan people in building their homes. In the past five years, he has constantly used poetry to reflect the changes in his own and his hometown's life, becoming an amateur author. He said: After liberation, life is getting better and better, changing every day. When I see something, I want to write and sing about it. Only by writing and singing can I feel comfortable.

    "Silly Girl" Becomes a Singer
    "Hearing the good report from the central leaders, I feel like I'm eating a fairy peach, my whole body is full of energy, and I can carry a thousand pounds without bending my back." Jiang Xiuzhen, a young amateur farmer singer from Anhui Province attending the Literary Congress, spoke to the conference on August 8 with her clear and bright singing.

    From birth until the liberation at the age of fourteen, many people didn't know Jiang Xiuzhen's name, but only called her "Silly Girl." At the age of eight, she began to graze cattle and collect firewood in the mountains for the landlord. No matter spring, summer, autumn, or winter, she was always barefoot. At that time, so much sorrow and grief, who could she turn to? She sang: "...The little cattle herder is so pitiful, he can't think of a hot meal on a sunny day, he can't think of dry clothes to wear on a rainy day...his head is buried in cold ashes, his feet are covered with a cold raincoat, and when he asks the boss for water to drink, the boss drives him out with a stick."

    After liberation, everything made her sing in her heart and sing non-stop. In the eleven years since liberation, she has used her spare time from production labor to write hundreds of folk songs. When she encounters major political or production tasks, she composes folk songs to carry out mobilization work in the fields. For example, when fighting drought last year, she composed a "Cattle Driving" tune: "The small waterwheel is long and long, like a dragon playing in the Yangtze River, we have the energy to fight drought and ensure the harvest, and we will harvest two years' worth of grain in one year."

    This "Silly Girl," who had no food, no clothes, and was illiterate in her childhood, can now not only write and speak, but also serves as the deputy director of the Ma'ya Commune Horticultural Farm in Guichi County, Anhui Province, the propaganda committee member of the Ma'ya Commune direct agency general branch of the Communist Youth League, and the head of the commune's amateur cultural troupe.

    业余文艺战士
    写出自己的歌
    为毛主席的词“娄山关”谱曲子的作者——东北某机械厂的车工王殿槐，这次来参加文代会。
    二十三岁的共青团员王殿槐从前做梦也想不到自己会作曲。他只念过六年书，就进了工厂。他在工作之余，常常和一些青年朋友一起唱歌。一次，党支部书记说：“什么时候我们能把自己的事，编成歌就好了。”这话给王殿槐很大启发。他想：“音乐家也不是天生的”。他就去买了有关作曲的小册子，看音乐杂志，练习记谱。当他写出第一个歌曲“战斗在车间”唱给工人听时，大家觉得不满意，提了好些意见，并鼓励他继续创造。经过努力，以后他创作出的“一天等于二十年”、“大干一百二十天”等歌曲，就受到大家欢迎。工厂党委会和辽宁省音乐协会发现后，就帮助他提高音乐才能，终于使他能够为毛主席的词谱曲。
    农民画家
    坐在我们面前的是一位腼腆、朴实的小伙子。他来自闻名全国的诗画之乡——江苏邳县，是农民画家，叫梁传魁。这位青年农民兴奋地谈起他成长为一个农民画家的过程。
    一次，梁传魁在邻村的墙壁上看到一幅“老黄牛告状”的漫画，幽默、生动地批评了饲养员，便对绘画发生了兴趣。不久省里开美术训练班，他被送去学习。他对教师所讲的艺术为政治服务等道理很能理解，就是对透视、构图等道理弄不懂。于是，他就苦学苦钻，到训练班结业时，已初步掌握了这些知识。回到乡里便在粉白的墙壁上画出第一幅壁画“工农联盟”。周围的乡亲看到梁传魁画出了大伙儿心里想说的事，比梁传魁还要高兴，便都来帮忙。梁传魁感到人多力量大，就把绘画的技术教给大家。不久，这个公社便成立了几十个业余美术小组。
    在公社党委书记领导下，美术小组由临摹发展到创作。白天在地里劳动时看到、想到、谈到的事，晚上就把它变成画稿，经过评选修改，再画上墙头。不到两个个月，这个公社就出现了九百多幅被群众喜爱的壁画，成为全县第一个壁画乡。
    少尉诗人
    在民间文艺界代表举行的一次联欢晚会上，我们遇到了藏族青年业余诗人——饶阶巴桑，他现在是解放军的少尉。他不仅出口成诗，而且能歌能舞。在晚会上，他弹着弦子，跳着民族舞，唱起新编的民歌：“蚕豆花儿处处开，要问我的生活怎样美好，请你看看蚕豆花儿多鲜艳……”。
    饶阶巴桑的青年时期，是在农奴主的鞭挞和斥责声中度过的。他自幼在“头人”家作杂役，自己也种过田，1951年人民解放军刚到西藏，他就借回家看父亲为名逃出牢笼，参了军。参军后，他当过侦察员，宣传员，也作过战。1955年他写了第一首诗：“绿色的海洋”，歌唱汉族干部热情帮助藏族人民建设家园。五年来，他不断用诗歌来反映自己和家乡生活的变化，成为一个业余作者。他说：解放以后生活越变越好，一天一个样，看到什么都想写、想唱。只有写出、唱出，心里才感到舒畅。“呆丫头”成了歌手
    “听到中央首长好报告，心里好似吃仙桃，浑身上下干劲添，肩挑千斤不弯腰”。出席文代会的安徽省青年业余农民歌手姜秀珍，8月8日，用她清脆嘹亮的歌唱向大会发言。
    姜秀珍从出生到十四岁解放那年，许多人都不知道她的名字，只唤她“呆丫头”。长到八岁，就开始给地主家放牛、上山打柴，不论春夏秋冬，她总是打着赤脚。那时节，多少悲痛多少愁，向谁去申诉呢？她唱道：“……放牛的小鬼真可怜，晴天想不到热饭吃，雨天想不到干衣穿……头冷灰里埋，脚冷蓑衣盖，向老板讨水喝，老板一棍子赶出来。”
    解放后，每件事都会使她歌上心头，唱不闭口。解放十一年来，她利用生产劳动的业余时间，编写的山歌已有好几百首。碰到重大政治任务或生产任务，她都编出山歌，在田间进行鼓动工作。例如去年抗旱的时候，她编了一首“赶牛”调：“小小水车长又长，好比蛟龙戏长江，抗旱保收有干劲，一年收打两年粮。”
    童年时代没吃没穿、不识一字的这个“呆丫头”，现在不但会写会说，而且当了安徽省贵池县马牙公社园艺场的副场长，担任了共青团马牙公社直属机关总支宣传委员，又是公社业余文工团的团长。
