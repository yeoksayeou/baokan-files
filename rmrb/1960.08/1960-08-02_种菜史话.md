A Brief History of Vegetable Cultivation Yang Min

It's difficult to say exactly when vegetable cultivation began. Zhuangzi's "Zhibei You" chapter says: Confucius said, "The garden of Xiwei and the garden of the Yellow Emperor…", the so-called "garden" is the vegetable garden. According to this, the history of vegetable cultivation can be traced back at least four to five thousand years. The Book of Songs mentions no fewer than twenty or thirty kinds of vegetables; and the Rites of Zhou mentions two kinds of specialized officials, "Changren" and "Lüshi". The former managed public gardens, and the latter managed private gardens.

The book Erya says: "Unripe vegetables are called famine," and "famine" is often mentioned in the same breath as "hunger" when the five grains fail; this fully illustrates the importance that ancient people attached to growing vegetables. The Rites of Zhou quotes Wang Zhaoyu as saying: "In the time of the former kings, there must be mulberry trees on the paths and melons on the fields, so as to exhaust the power of the land without leaving any profit." The "fields" here refer to various large or small vacant lands that are of no use. In order to prevent the "fields" used for collecting grain from being idle, people must also cultivate them into gardens after the autumn harvest, and then build them firmly into fields by the time of the next autumn harvest, so the Book of Songs says: "In the ninth month, build fields and gardens; in the tenth month, collect grain."

The book of Fan Shengzhi, written around the first century BC, mentioned planting scallions or small beans in melon fields, which is the earliest example of "intercropping" in the world; Jia Sixie's Qi Min Yao Shu in the Later Wei Dynasty described in more detail the methods of planting coriander in scallion fields, turnips in hemp fields, and hemp in elm and locust tree nurseries, and even mentioned that yarrow could be planted under the shade of trees; these are all good experiences gained from long-term practice based on the characteristics of vegetables to increase the area of vegetable production.

A few ancient governments and intellectuals also understood the importance of vegetable production. During the reigns of Emperor Huan and Emperor He of the Han Dynasty, the government also encouraged people to grow vegetables to help with the five grains. More interestingly, Gong Sui of the Han Dynasty, it is said that when he was the governor of Bohai, he specifically instructed his subordinates to plant an elm tree, a hundred scallions, fifty onions, and a plot of leeks per person on average. It is said that Zhuge Liang ordered his soldiers to plant turnips everywhere he went. Therefore, some people still like to call turnips "Zhuge vegetables."

In terms of vegetable cultivation techniques, there is even more to be praised. In Jia Sixie's "Qi Min Yao Shu", there are excellent records of seed selection, seed storage, germination, seedling cultivation, transplanting, thinning, grafting, fertilization, etc. Many of them are still worth referring to and studying today.

The history of using greenhouses to cultivate vegetables in our country can be traced back to the Han Dynasty at the latest. The Book of Han says: "Xin Chen was conscripted as Shaofu… The Taiguan Garden planted winter onions, leeks, and vegetables, and covered them with houses. It burned fire day and night, and it grew when the temperature was right." It can be seen that by the Tang and Song dynasties, greenhouse cultivation of vegetables was no longer surprising.

It is estimated that as early as before the Christian era, Chinese farmers had cultivated as many as fifty kinds of vegetables. Most of them have been retained and developed to the present; a few have become other varieties; and some, whose names have not yet been clarified, are very intriguing. For example, "Kui," which is particularly valued in Qi Min Yao Shu, is said to be able to be planted three times a year, and its leaves grow as they are cut. One acre of Kui can be harvested for three years, which is better than "ten qing" of grain fields. Some people believe that this kind of Kui is the "Donghancai" that is called in Guangdong area, and it grows in many places in the north and south.

Ancient people made great efforts in the vegetable industry, but due to the limitations of the social system, for thousands of years, they always stuck to the rules and did not get the development they deserved. After liberation, the situation has changed greatly. According to the statistics of 39 large and medium-sized cities that participated in the Second Non-Staple Food Production Conference in 1959, the area of vegetable cultivation has reached more than 11 million mu, and the output has reached more than 47 billion jin. In addition, Guiyang City has created the advanced experience of intercropping and interplanting vegetables nine times in a year; fresh vegetables can also be eaten in the cold northeast all year round. In recent years, Liaoning Province has also reduced the cost of greenhouse vegetable production a lot by promoting the use of industrial waste heat to heat greenhouses and unheated greenhouses.

According to recent reports: The Soviet Union has successfully cultivated vegetables quickly by using electric light and nutrients. Soviet agricultural physicist Academician Yoffe said when introducing the experiment: "The tomatoes grown in the laboratory have never seen sunlight, but their taste, maturity and yield have all exceeded those of ordinary tomatoes." It also pointed out that the cost of cultivating vegetables in this way will become the same as that of ordinary greenhouses with the development of the power industry.

    种菜史话	杨旻
    蔬菜的种植具体起源于什么时候，已很难说。《庄子》《知北游》篇云：仲尼曰：“狶韦氏之囿，黄帝之圃……”，所谓“圃”，也就是菜园。据此，则种菜的历史至少当可追溯到四五千年以上。《诗经》上提到的蔬菜，已不下二三十种；而《周礼》《地官》更提到“场人”和“闾师”两种专官，前者管理公家的场圃，后者管理的是私人的园地。
    《尔雅》一书说：“蔬不熟为馑”，“馑”和五谷不登时所发生的“饥”，常常相提并论；这就充分地说明了古代人们对种菜是非常重视的。《周礼》《订义》引王昭禹的话说：“先王之时，径行必有桑，疆场必有瓜，所以尽地力而无遗利。”这里所说的“疆场”，是指的没有什么用途的各种或大或小的空闲地。为了不让纳禾稼用的
  “场”闲着，在秋收后人们还一定要把它耕辟为圃，到来年秋收时，再筑坚为场，所以《诗经》上说：“九月筑场圃，十月纳禾稼。”
    公元前一世纪左右的《泛胜之书》曾提到在瓜区中种薤或小豆，这是世界上最早的关于“套作”的一个例子；后魏贾思勰的《齐民要术》，更详细叙述了葱地中种胡荽，麻子地里种芜菁，楮树、槐树育苗地里种麻子的方法，甚至还说到在树荫之下，可以种植蘘荷；这些都是根据蔬菜的特性，从长期的实践中得来的增加蔬菜生产面积的好经验。
    古代的政府和知识分子有少数也理解蔬菜生产的重要性。汉代桓帝、和帝时候，政府也曾劝民种植蔬菜，以助五谷，更有趣的是汉朝的龚遂，据说当他作渤海太守的时候，曾具体地指示所属，平均要一口人种一榆树、百本薤、五十本葱、一畦韭。相传诸葛亮每到一处一定要命兵士随时随地种植蔓菁。所以至今还有人喜欢称蔓菁为“诸葛菜”。
    在种菜的技术上，值得称道的更多。举凡选种、藏种、催芽、育秧、移栽、间拔、嫁接、施肥……，早在贾思勰的“齐民要术”上，就已有非常出色的记载。其中有不少甚至在今天仍然值得参考和研究。
    利用温室栽培蔬菜的历史，在我国至迟也可以追溯到汉代。《汉书》《召信臣传》说：“信臣征为少府……太官园种冬生葱、韭、菜茹，复以屋庑，昼夜燃蕴火，待温气乃生。”可见，到了唐宋时代，温室栽培蔬菜已经是不足为奇了。
    据估计，远在公元以前，我国农民栽培的蔬菜，就已达五十来种。其中大多数都一直保留、发展到了现在；少数已变成了其他的品种；更有一些，其名称至今尚未弄清，但又非常耐人寻味。例如《齐民要术》特别推重的“葵”，据说一年可以种三期，其叶随剪随生，以一亩葵计，收获三年，胜作“十顷”谷田。有人认为：这种葵就是广东一带所称的“冬寒菜”，南北许多地方都有生长。
    古代人们在种菜业上是作了巨大的努力的，但由于社会制度的限制，数千年来，也总是墨守成规，没有得到应有的发展。解放以后，情况就大大改变，据1959年参加第二次副食品生产会议的三十九个大中城市的统计，蔬菜栽培面积就已达一千一百多万亩，产量达四百七十多亿斤。此外，贵阳市曾创造了在一年中套作、间作九次蔬菜的先进经验；寒冷的东北在一年四季也早已能吃到新鲜蔬菜，近几年来，辽宁省由于推行利用工业废热加热温室和不加温的温室，还使温室生产蔬菜的成本降低不少。
    据最近报载：苏联利用电灯光和营养质快速培植蔬菜已得到成功。苏联农业物理学家约费院士介绍试验的情况时说：“在实验室里成长起来的西红柿根本没有见过太阳光，但是它们的味道、成熟期限和收获量却都超过了普通种植的西红柿。”又指出用这种方法培育蔬菜的成本，将随着电力工业的发展，而变得和普通暖房的一样。
