    Work hard is a fine tradition of our Party's cadres. During the war years, they led the masses in fighting the enemy, fought alongside soldiers on the battlefield, eliminated the enemy, strengthened ourselves, and achieved victory. In the construction period, they worked with workers and farmers in workshops and fields, changing the "poor and blank" face of our country and winning continuous great leaps forward.

    Since the implementation of the "two-five system" leadership method in various places, this style of working with the masses has become more common, more frequent, and more in-depth. In many places, about 70% to 80% of the cadres work with the masses in the fields, eat in the fields, and even sleep in the fields. They are barefoot and bareheaded, holding hoes in their hands, and carrying record books, recording their work wherever they go, truly acting as ordinary laborers. Their exemplary actions and leading roles have encouraged the masses and promoted production. The commune members sing: If the cadres can take the lead, we can refuel; if the cadres can carry bricks, we can build buildings; if cadres and the masses work together, there is no need to worry about a good harvest!

    Cadres are ordinary laborers, and at the same time, they are production leaders. Therefore, when cadres participate in production, they should consider everything comprehensively, grasp the key points, and work purposefully and planned, not just do whatever comes their way. The Wuqiao Chengguan Commune Party Committee in Hebei proposed that cadres should go to the most crucial places to participate in production and do the most difficult work, which is completely correct. The most crucial places and the most difficult work are the places where contradictions are most concentrated. If they are not resolved, other things will be affected, and the work cannot be fully carried out. We must adapt to the time and local conditions, always grasp the key points, and use the "dissecting a sparrow" method to solve them, gain experience, and promote them comprehensively. Only in this way can we play the role of leading production.

    However, to lead well, we must first work well. To be more than just an ordinary laborer, we must first be an ordinary laborer. Only by working diligently as an ordinary laborer can we understand where the key lies, discern the truth of the matter, and then propose solutions, and through personal practice, gain experience, comprehensively promote it, and guide production. In the five months since Wuqiao County, Hebei, promoted the "two-five system," it has summarized thousands of experiences in various tasks, primarily because the cadres worked in practice.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said it well: "...the basic tasks of the Communist Party's leading organs lie in understanding the situation and grasping policies, the former being what is called knowing the world and the latter being what is called transforming the world." ("Reform Our Study") Cadres grasp the situation through work – knowing the world, which only counts as accomplishing one major task; they must also analyze problems and solve problems based on the Party's policies – transforming the world. Only when these two major tasks are done well can the purpose of cadres participating in production and leading production be achieved.

    干，是我们党的干部的优良传统。在战争年代里，他们带领群众与敌搏斗，和战士一起转战沙场，消灭了敌人，壮大了自己，取得了胜利。在建设时期，他们又同工人、农民一起，战斗在车间和田野，改变着我国“一穷二白”的面貌，赢得了持续大跃进。
    “二五制”领导方法在各地推行以来，这种和群众一起干的作风，更为普遍，更为经常，更为深入。许多地方百分之七十到百分之八十左右的干部，都和群众干在田间，吃在田间，甚至睡在田间。他们赤脚光头，手拿锄头，身怀记工本，干在哪里，就记在哪里，真正做到了一个普通劳动者。他们的模范行动和带头作用，鼓舞了群众，推动了生产。社员歌颂道：干部能带头，我们能加油；干部能搬砖，我们能修楼；干群齐努力，丰收不用愁！
    干部是普通劳动者，同时是生产领导者。因此，干部在参加生产时，应当全面考虑，抓住关键，有目的，有计划地干，不能碰到什么就干什么。河北吴桥城关公社党委提出，干部要到最关键的地方去参加生产，干困难最多的活，这是完全正确的。最关键的地方，困难最多的活，就是矛盾最集中的地方，若不加以解决，别的事情就会受到影响，工作就不能全面铺开。我们要因时因地制宜，时刻抓住关键，并用“解剖麻雀”的办法，把它解决，取得经验，全面推广。这样，才能起到领导生产的作用。
    但是，要领导好，又必须首先干好。要想不仅仅当一个普通劳动者，又必须首先是一个普通劳动者。只有以普通劳动者的身份，踏踏实实地干上一番，才能了解关键之所在，洞察问题的真相，从而提出解决问题的办法，并通过亲身实践，取得经验，全面推广，指导生产。河北吴桥县推广“二五制”五个月来，总结出各项工作的数千条经验，首先就是因为干部在实际中干的结果。
    毛泽东同志说得好：“……共产党领导机关的基本任务，就在于了解情况和掌握政策两件大事，前一件事就是所谓认识世界，后一件事就是所谓改造世界。”（“改造我们的学习”）干部通过干，掌握了情况——认识了世界，这只算办了一件大事；还必须根据党的政策，分析问题，解决问题——改造世界。这两件大事都办好了，才能达到干部参加生产、领导生产的目的。
