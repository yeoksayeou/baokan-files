Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 21st:  The broad masses of workers on Shanghai's industrial production front were greatly encouraged after seeing the People's Daily editorial published on August 18th, "Immediately Launch an Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement Centered on Grain and Steel." They are determined to launch a new upsurge of the increase production and practice economy movement with greater revolutionary vigor, and to practically and by all means guarantee the fulfillment and overfulfillment of this year's production plan for steel and other major products.

Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Shanghai's more than one million workers, since the end of June this year, have launched a vigorous socialist labor competition movement around the central task of comprehensively fulfilling the state plan. At the same time, leading cadres of factories and enterprises throughout the city have also better improved their leadership style, gone deep into the front line of production, and worked with workers to study and solve key production problems, thereby further stimulating the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and promoting the sustained rise of production.

At present, workers on the city's industrial front are taking steel as the key link and further launching socialist labor competitions, setting off a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy. Steel workers, with the full support of all walks of life, have taken the lead in the increase production and practice economy movement and have already created outstanding achievements. The No. 1 cupola furnace in the second converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, because "politics went to the furnace, overcoming technical barriers," created the highest record for the melting rate of large alkaline cupola furnaces in the country, becoming a benchmark for steel workers throughout the city to attack key points and increase steel production. Now, under the resounding slogan of "Learn from No. 1 Cupola Furnace, Catch up with No. 1 Cupola Furnace, Surpass No. 1 Cupola Furnace," steel workers throughout the city are vigorously promoting the communist style of cooperation, setting off a rapidly developing mass competition upsurge to catch up with the advanced. Workers of the No. 4 cupola furnace in the converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 vowed to surpass No. 1 cupola furnace. They regarded their furnace as a "learn, catch up, and surpass" experimental furnace, strengthening collaboration up, down, left, and right, and the melting rate on the first day of operation reached more than twenty-four tons. After workers in the first converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 issued the battle cry of "Striving for the upstream requires a surge of energy, leading the masses requires one heart, and reclaiming the red flag of 1958," the daily output in the past few days has broken through the 300-ton mark. The "protect the red flag" and "seize the red flag" competition between the open hearth furnace workshops of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 is very enthusiastic. While they are catching up with each other and promoting each other, they also support each other and cooperate extensively, so that the daily steel production level rises steadily.

Just as the steel front workers are striving for high yield, high quality, and comprehensive leap forward, many factories and enterprises throughout the city have also launched a vigorous competition. In order to support the sustained leap forward of the steel industry and ensure the timely, high-quality, and high-quantity completion of the manufacturing tasks of high-speed blowers and 300-ton friction brick presses, Shanghai Dalong Machine Factory, according to the requirements of the state plan, lined up important production key points one by one, and from the beginning of August, launched a "one-dragon" competition throughout the factory from drawings, materials, tools, to wooden molds, castings, forgings, and metalworking departments, achieving tight links and implementation of measures, ensuring the timely completion of manufacturing tasks. Workers in other industries have also adopted different forms to launch competitions centered on ensuring the comprehensive fulfillment of production plans. In the increase production and practice economy movement, many factories have told the specific plans assigned by the state to the unit to the workers, mobilized everyone to discuss, and formulated specific indicators and measures for completing and overfulfilling the state plan.

The further development of "one person equaling several," this lively and vigorous mass competition activity, is a prominent feature of the current new upsurge of increase production and practice economy on Shanghai's industrial production front. The practice of many factories and enterprises has proved that more extensive and in-depth development of the "one person equaling several" competition is an important guarantee for comprehensively and overfulfilling the state plan; and continuing to do a good job in the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of the technical revolution around the key production points is the fundamental way to achieve "one person equaling several." Shanghai Smelting Plant, in the "one person equaling several" activity, focused on the current key production points, greatly grasped the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of the technical revolution, not only did production flourish, but also innovation projects emerged one after another, ensuring the overfulfillment of the state plan in July, and in the first half of August, achieved a high yield, high quality, and comprehensive leap forward. Leading cadres of the Jing'an District Metallurgical Industry Party General Branch went deep into the front line of production, specifically helped the grassroots think of ways and come up with ideas, helped workers find key points, make innovations, and vigorously engaged in the "one person equaling several" competition, thereby promoting a substantial increase in production.

### 掀起增产节约新高潮　保证超额完成国家计划  上海职工开展“一顶几”劳动竞赛  上钢三厂一号化铁炉飘起增产红旗，全市炼钢工人奋起追先进

    掀起增产节约新高潮　保证超额完成国家计划
    上海职工开展“一顶几”劳动竞赛
    上钢三厂一号化铁炉飘起增产红旗，全市炼钢工人奋起追先进
    新华社上海21日电　上海工业生产战线广大职工看到人民日报8月18日发表的“立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动”的社论以后，受到莫大鼓舞。他们决心以更大的革命干劲掀起增产节约运动的新高潮，踏踏实实地、千方百计地保证完成和超额完成今年的钢和其它主要产品的生产计划。
    上海百多万职工在中共上海市委的领导下，从今年的6月底起就围绕全面完成国家计划这一中心任务，展开了轰轰烈烈的社会主义劳动竞赛运动。与此同时，全市各工厂企业的领导干部也更好地改进领导作风，深入生产第一线，同职工一道研究和解决生产关键问题，从而更加激发了广大职工的劳动热情，促进了生产的持续上升。
    目前，全市工业战线上的职工都在以钢为纲，更进一步展开社会主义劳动竞赛，掀起增产节约新热潮。钢铁工人在各行各业的全力支援下，在增产节约运动中一马当先，已经创造了出色的成绩。上钢三厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉因为“政治到炉前，攻克技术关”，创造了全国大型碱性化铁炉熔化率的最高纪录，成了全市钢铁工人攻关键增产钢铁的一个标兵。现在，全市炼钢工人在“学一号化铁炉、赶一号化铁炉、超一号化铁炉”的响亮口号下，大兴共产主义协作之风，掀起了一个来势迅猛的追赶先进的群众竞赛热潮。上钢五厂转炉车间四号化铁炉工人立誓要超一号化铁炉。他们把自己的炉子作为“学赶超”的试验炉，上下左右，加强协作，开炉第一天的熔化率就达到二十四吨多。上钢一厂第一转炉车间工人发出了“力争上游要一股劲，领导群众要一条心，夺回1958年一面红旗”的战斗誓言以后，这几天的日产量都闯过了三百吨大关。上钢一厂、上钢三厂平炉车间之间开展的“保红旗”和“夺红旗”竞赛十分热烈。他们在你追我赶、相互促进的同时，还相互支持，广泛协作，使钢的日产水平节节上升。
    就在钢铁战线职工力争高产优质全面跃进的同时，全市许多工厂企业也展开了热火朝天的竞赛。上海大隆机器厂为了支援钢铁工业持续跃进，保证按时按质按量地完成高速鼓风机和三百吨摩擦压砖机的制造任务，根据国家计划要求，把重要生产关键逐项排队，从8月初开始，在全厂范围内开展了一个从图纸、材料、工具，一直到木模、铸件、锻件、金工等部门的“一条龙”竞赛，做到了环环扣紧，措施落实。保证制造任务的按时完成。其它各行各业的职工，也都采取不同的形式，展开了以保证全面完成生产计划为中心的竞赛。许多厂在增产节约运动中，把国家分配给本单位的具体计划告诉职工群众，发动大家讨论，制订出了完成和超额完成国家计划的具体指标及措施。
    “一顶几”这种生动活泼的群众竞赛活动的进一步开展，是当前上海工业生产战线增产节约新高潮的一个鲜明特点。许多工厂企业的实践证明：更广泛深入地开展“一顶几”竞赛，是全面和超额完成国家计划的一项重要保证；而继续围绕生产关键作好技术革命的巩固推广提高工作，则是实现“一顶几”的根本途径。上海冶炼厂在“一顶几”活动中针对当前生产关键，大抓技术革命的巩固推广提高，不仅生产蒸蒸日上，革新项目也层出不穷，保证了7月份国家计划的超额完成，8月上半月又实现了高产优质全面跃进。静安区冶金行业党总支的领导干部深入生产第一线，具体地帮助基层想办法、出点子，帮助工人找关键，闹革新，大搞“一顶几”竞赛，从而促进了生产大幅度上升。
