A Good Commune Member

    An Accountant Everyone Trusts
    In the middle of the night, accountant Wang Shengzu was awakened from his sleep by Song Jinhuan.
    Commune member Song Jinhuan couldn't sleep because he was worried his income would decrease, so he sought out the accountant to settle accounts. Wang Shengzu, who had worked hard all day, had his rest disturbed, but he didn't show any resentment. He calculated and explained each item, spending two nights in a row helping Song Jinhuan clear up the accounts. Afterwards, Song Jinhuan told everyone he met, "The accounts are clear, my mind is bright, and I have more energy to work." Whenever a commune member came to check the accounts, Wang Shengzu always explained patiently and carefully until they fully understood.
    Wang Shengzu announced the accounts once a month. If someone didn't pay attention to the statements, he would go to the production team and announce the accounts orally again during his rest time. The commune members all said, "With Wang Shengzu managing the accounts, we can rest assured even with our eyes closed." To allow the commune members to better supervise financial management and to facilitate their account checking, Wang Shengzu also changed the team's accounts to multi-column detailed accounts, so that the accounts of the commune members, the production team, and the brigade were all consistent and without errors.
    Since becoming the accountant of Zhouyi Production Team of Louguan Commune in Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi Province, Wang Shengzu has been diligent, thrifty, honest, and selfless. For seven years, he has recorded accounts every day, but he has only used eleven pen nibs, each one worn down, sharpened, and used again. The envelopes he uses are also made from old newspapers. Some people jokingly say, "Saving a pen nib or an envelope, how much does that amount to for each household?" Wang Shengzu smiles and says, "Every little bit is the sweat of the commune members, and we must cherish the property of the commune."

    人人放心的会计
    半夜，会计员王绳祖被宋金焕从梦中喊醒。
    社员宋金焕因怕自己收入减少，睡不着，就找会计来算账。本来劳动一天的王绳祖，休息又被打扰，可是他并没有半点怨色，一宗宗计算，一宗宗解释，一连两个晚上帮宋金焕算清了账。以后宋金焕逢人就说：“账算得清，心里亮堂，干啥劲都大。”无论什么时候，只要社员来查账，王绳祖总是很耐心、细心的解释，直到完全弄明白为止。
    王绳祖每个月都公布一次账目，有人不注意看账单，他就到小队，利用休息时间，再口头宣布一次账目。社员们都说：“叫王绳祖管账，闭上眼睛也放心。”为了让社员更好的监督财务管理，便利社员查账，王绳祖还把队里的账目改成多栏明细账，使社员、小队、大队的账目，账账相符，不出差错。
    王绳祖在担任陕西盩厔县楼观公社盩一生产队会计以来，克勤克俭，廉洁奉公。七年来，天天记账，却只用过十一个钢笔尖，每个钢笔尖都是秃了磨，磨了再用。经他手用的信封，也都是用旧报纸糊的。有人打趣说：“省一个笔尖、一个信封，算到一家一户有多大一点点呀！”王绳祖笑笑说：“一点点都是社员的汗水，是社里的财产就要爱惜。”
