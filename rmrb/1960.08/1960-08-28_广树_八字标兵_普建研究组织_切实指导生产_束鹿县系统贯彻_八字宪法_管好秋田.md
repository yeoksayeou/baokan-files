This newspaper, Tianjin, August 27th: The Party committees at all levels in Shulu County, Hebei Province, have universally promoted the method of establishing "Eight-Character Charter" pace-setters, comprehensively and meticulously implementing the agricultural "Eight-Character Charter," powerfully promoting the current agricultural production increase competition movement centered on field management, and improving the technical level of field management.

The Zhaobazhuang Commune Party Committee in Shulu County, in leading production, implemented the agricultural "Eight-Character Charter" according to local conditions, widely established "Eight-Character Charter" pace-setters, and launched a mass movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the pace-setters, so that agricultural science and technology and advanced mass experience could be quickly promoted. After discovering this experience, the county Party committee vigorously promoted it throughout the county. The county Party committee adopted the method of establishing pace-setters for whatever work was being grasped and summarizing and promoting whatever advanced experience was needed for agricultural work. For example, in this year's summer drought resistance, the county Party committee proposed to focus on grasping the "water" character, widely establishing "water" character pace-setters, and promoted the advanced experience of Mi Fujin, a "water" character pace-setter from the Zhaoba Commune, in sinking machine wells throughout the county; in seedling management, focusing on the "density" character, widely establishing "density" character pace-setters, and comprehensively promoting the experience of Cao Tongyi, a "density" character pace-setter from the Zhoujiazhuang Production Team of the Dongzhuozhuo Commune, in reasonable close planting according to local conditions, and so on. Through the promotion of these advanced experiences, not only was production powerfully promoted, but also a scientific and technological contingent rapidly grew and expanded. Up to now, the "Eight-Character Charter" committees and research groups have been universally established in all communes, production teams, and production squads in the county, and tens of thousands of production activists have participated in the study of "Eight-Character Charter" agricultural new technologies throughout the county.

In the implementation of various measures of the agricultural "Eight-Character Charter," Shulu County emphasized the mutual cooperation between the eight characters. For example, the Lijiachuang Production Team of the Dongzhuosu Commune, in order to strengthen the late-stage management of cotton, the "Eight-Character Charter" research station, in response to the situation that this year's cotton plants were large, with dense branches and leaves, making operations inconvenient, proposed five comprehensive management measures including pushing plants and merging ridges, eliminating pests, meticulous pruning, watching plants and topdressing, and comprehensive cultivation. Each pace-setter group served the "management" character, dispatched troops and generals for the "management" character, and matched labor according to the operation, which not only ensured the realization of the operation plan, but also greatly improved work efficiency and quality. In order to manage the county's 750,000 mu of cotton fields well, in early and mid-August, the county Party committee and the commune Party committee invited eight-character pace-setters and technicians to discuss the issue of "guaranteeing the bolls are not rotten and striving for autumn bolls to cover the top," and formulated specific measures for managing cotton fields based on the situation that this year's cotton seedlings were dense and rain was prone to causing bud and boll shedding. For example, the Huai Shu Commune mainly adopted fine pruning, pushing plants and merging ridges, controlling excessive growth, and preventing boll shedding and rotten bolls for first-class cotton with lush branches and leaves and many buds; for second and third-class cotton with less dense branches and leaves, the focus was on topdressing with quick-acting fertilizer. After adopting these methods, the phenomenon of boll shedding and rotten bolls was significantly reduced.

After more than a year of practical experience, it has been proven that widely establishing "Eight-Character Charter" pace-setters has the following four major benefits:

First, it combines advanced science and technology with the practical experience of the masses, accelerates the speed of promoting new technologies, and effectively improves the scientific and technological level of the masses.

Second, through the eight-character pace-setters, the popularization of science and technology is combined with the development of overproduction competitions, achieving practical and skillful work.

Third, through the widespread establishment of eight-character pace-setters, the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" has achieved organization, systematization, and regularization. In promoting this experience, party committees at all levels, from the county and commune to the production team, squad, and square field, have established "Eight-Character Charter" research organizations at all levels, and have universally formulated relatively complete systems for learning, production, and technical research, laying a solid organizational foundation for the comprehensive implementation of the agricultural "Eight-Character Charter."

Fourth, the widespread establishment of eight-character pace-setters and the popularization of science and technology have also opened up avenues for the vast number of cadres to delve into work, study science and technology, and improve their leadership level. According to statistics, in less than a year, 2,470 county, commune, and management area cadres have learned more than a dozen agricultural new technologies; more than 410 people have learned to operate the boiler camel machine, gas engine, and tractor.

### 广树“八字标兵”  普建研究组织　切实指导生产  束鹿县系统贯彻“八字宪法”管好秋田

    广树“八字标兵”  普建研究组织　切实指导生产
    束鹿县系统贯彻“八字宪法”管好秋田
    本报天津27日电　河北省束鹿县各级党委普遍推广了树立“八字宪法”标兵的办法，全面细致地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，有力地推动了当前以田间管理为中心的农业增产竞赛运动，提高了田间管理技术水平。
    束鹿县赵八庄公社党委在领导生产中，因地制宜地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，广树“八字宪法”标兵，开展学赶超标兵的群众运动，使农业科学技术和群众先进经验得以很快地推广。县委发现这一经验后，便在全县大力推广。县委采取了抓什么工作，就树什么标兵，农活需要什么，就总结推广什么先进经验的办法。如在今年夏季抗旱中，县委提出以抓“水”字为中心，广树“水”字标兵，在全县范围内推广了赵八公社“水”字标兵秘福进打机井的先进经验；在苗期管理中，以“密”字为中心，广树“密”字标兵，全面推广了东卓卓公社周家庄生产队“密”字标兵曹同义因地制宜合理密植的经验等。通过这些先进经验的推广，不仅有力地推动了生产，并使科学技术队伍迅速成长壮大。到目前为止，全县各公社、生产队和生产小队，普遍建立了“八字宪法”委员会和研究组，参加“八字宪法”农业新技术学习的生产积极分子，全县达数万人。
    束鹿县在贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的各项措施中，强调了八字之间互相配合。如东卓宿公社理家庄生产队，为加强棉花后期管理，“八字宪法”研究站针对今年棉棵大、枝叶密茂不便作业的情况，提出了采取推棵并垅、除治虫害、精细整枝、看棵追肥、全面中耕等五项综合管理措施，各个标兵组都为“管”字服务，为“管”字调兵遣将，按作业进行劳力配套，不光保证了作业计划的实现，还大大提高了工作效率和质量。为了管好全县七十五万亩棉田，8月上中旬县委和公社党委曾邀请八字标兵和技术员，座谈“保伏桃不烂、争秋桃盖顶”问题，并根据今年棉苗密、雨多容易造成蕾铃脱落的情况，制订管理棉田的具体措施。例如槐树公社对枝叶茂盛、株高蕾多的一类棉，主要采取了精细整枝，推棵并垅，控制徒长，防落蕾烂桃；对枝叶不太密茂的二、三类棉，中心是追速效肥料，采取这些办法后，落蕾烂桃的现象显著减少。
    经过一年多的实践经验证明，广树“八字标兵”有以下四大好处：
    第一、它把先进的科学技术和群众的实践经验结合起来，加快了推广新技术的速度，有效地提高了群众的科学技术水平。
    第二、通过八字标兵，把普及科学技术与开展超产竞赛结合起来，作到实干、巧干。
    第三、通过广树八字标兵，使“八字宪法”的贯彻达到了组织化、系统化、经常化。各级党委在推广这一经验中，从县、社到生产队、小队、方田，层层建立了“八字宪法”研究组织，普遍制定了较完整的学习、生产、技术研究等制度，为全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”奠定了稳固的组织基础。
    第四、通过广树八字标兵和普及科学技术，也为广大干部深入工作、学习科学技术、提高领导水平，开辟了道路。据统计，不到一年的时间，全县就有二千四百七十名县、社、管理区干部学会了十多种农业新技术；有四百一十多人学会了开锅驼机、煤气机和拖拉机。（附图片）
