Transforming Lengquan Stele

Li Musen, Secretary of the Committee of the Xin Shenghuo People's Commune, Qichun, Hubei

The place called "Lengquan Stele" (Cold Spring Stele) gets its name from nine cold springs. It is a large depression between two mountains, with about a thousand mu of paddy fields. Because the nine cold springs constantly gush water outwards, plus the seepage from the slopes on both sides, this large area of land has become very cold and waterlogged; especially when the rainy season comes in summer, mountain water falls into the depression, causing both flooding and waterlogging. After a heavy rain overnight, the fields are a vast expanse of white the next day. Therefore, most of the rice seedlings planted each year cannot grow strong tillers, resulting in sparse and weak plants and very low yields. It is a well-known backward depression. Within this area of tens of miles, there are only fifty or sixty households. In the past, no one dared to think of changing the face of Lengquan Stele. Only the giant of the People's Commune dared to "break ground on the head of the God of Tai Sui" (take on a seemingly impossible task).

In March of this year, the Commune Party Committee decided to transform ten thousand mu of low-yielding fields, starting with Lengquan Stele to create a solid example. After the meeting, the entire commune organized a strong and well-equipped assault team.

The day we arrived at Lengquan Stele, there had just been a heavy rain, and mountain water poured down, like a river, making it almost impossible to see the field ridges. At this time, the cadres and assault team members temporarily transferred from various management areas and production teams arrived one after another. We immediately found some people, stuck "Sample Field" signs in a field at the bottom of the depression, took off our shoes, and jumped into the water to start working. Liu Laodie (Old Man Liu), an old farmer who had been farming here for more than forty years, hurriedly ran over. He looked at me with surprised eyes and said, "Secretary Li, the commune is setting up a 'sample' here?" I said, "Yes! Do you think it will work?" The old man excitedly said, "With the leadership of the Party, this should be the year that Lengquan Stele turns over!" He pondered for a moment, then continued, "However, it won't work to just apply fertilizer in this depression. You have to treat the root cause, block the mountain water, and drain the water from the cold springs." The old man's words inspired us. The solution is: build dikes around the springs, dig ditches to drain water; open channels along the mountains, raise field ridges; prevent spring water from entering the fields, prevent mountain water from entering the depression, prevent fertile water from leaving the fields, and increase green manure in the paddy fields to improve the soil.

A thousand-strong labor force set up camp on the slopes on both sides and in villages within a ten-mile radius. Red flags fluttered all over the fields, and people cheered. A huge slogan, "Everything for Balanced Production Increase," was also erected at the crossroads. Lengquan Stele has become a surging battlefield.

Enclosing the large spring at the "dragon head" was a major battle. The youth assault team, which had just been transferred from the "Hero Cave" (a channel through the mountain) on the water conservancy construction site to support Lengquan Stele, signed up for battle one after another. Fifteen young men, led by Communist Youth League branch secretary Wang Zicheng, eagerly requested to tame this dragon head spring, undertaking the glorious task of removing a large tree on the "dragon head." When everyone started pulling the tree together, Wang Zicheng said with a smile, "Be careful, you might even pull out a dragon!" Yuan Maotou also said with a smile, "It would be even better to pull out a dragon, I'm just looking for this scourge to settle the score." Everyone laughed. With a loud bang, the tree was pulled up. A stream of piercingly cold water gushed out, making everyone shiver. But none of the young men retreated. They gritted their teeth and stood in the cold water, digging ditches and building banks, persisting in the battle for two hours, and finally subdued this spring, obediently flowing into the large drainage ditch along the newly opened channel.

Ten days later, the face of Lengquan Stele changed greatly. The newly opened five large channels through the depression are three thousand meters long; dikes are built around every spring, and ditches are dug at every dike, not only eliminating waterlogging but also basically preventing mountain water from entering the depression, spring water from flooding the fields, and fertile water from leaving the fields. Large springs flow into large ditches, small springs flow into small ditches, small ditches connect to large channels, and spring water does not linger, raising the ground temperature and preventing the loss of fertile water. More than a thousand field ridges were renovated, and soybeans were planted on the smooth field ridges for the first time ever.

Then, in another five days, five hundred laborers rushed to transplant early rice seedlings on a thousand mu, half a month earlier than in previous years, catching up with advanced areas in terms of timing. After the seedlings were planted, a competition to cultivate and manage them was launched. Five days after transplanting, they rushed to weed and fertilize for the first time. The seedlings changed day by day, overshadowing many large depressions and fields nearby. The changes in Lengquan Stele shocked the whole county, and communes throughout the county sent people to visit and learn from Lengquan Stele.

Unexpectedly, when weeding for the second time, the seedlings in more than fifty mu of fields in the middle of the depression changed their color, the roots turned black, and the leaves turned from green to yellow. The commune members unanimously guaranteed, "We must resolutely protect this red flag!" "We must raise the red flag higher and higher!" Wang Dong'e and Yuan Maotou, two fierce generals, led two professional management teams of young men and women, and issued a vow to protect the red flag. Thus, another battle to treat the seedlings was launched. At this time, Dong Shu, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, personally came here. He was very concerned about our struggle to transform Lengquan Stele and encouraged everyone to persevere until the final victory! Acidic fertilizer was applied to the fields, and after the sun evaporated it, the cold soaking was completely dispelled. Lengquan Stele is no longer cold forever. New, white and tender roots grew around the withered roots, and the seedlings turned green again and started tillering.

Now, the whole depression is a green sea of rice, the rice is generally heading and flowering, and the fragrance is intoxicating. People passing by praise such good crops when they see them. The other day, I ran into Liu Laodie, who gave a thumbs up and said, "The Communist Party really has a way, a thousand-year-old backward depression has now been completely turned over."

    改造冷泉碑
    中共湖北蕲春新生活人民公社委员会书记　李木森
    “冷泉碑”这地方，是因九股冷泉得名的。两边是山，中间是条大垅，约有一千多亩水田。由于九股冷泉常年向外窜水，加上两边山坡的浸水，使这大片土地变得非常冷浸；特别入夏雨季来了，山水落垅，上涝下渍，一夜大雨，次日田畈里白茫茫一片，所以每年插下秧苗，绝大部分不能发棵分蘖，蔸稀苗瘦，产量很低，是个有名的落后垅。在这方园数十里内，只有五、六十户人家，从前没有人敢想改变冷泉碑的面貌，只有人民公社这个巨人，才敢于在“太岁头上动土”。
    今年3月间，公社党委会决定，改造万亩低产田，首先从冷泉碑着手，扎扎实实地做出一个样子来。会议结束后，就由全公社组织起一支兵强马壮的突击队。
    我们到冷泉碑的那天，刚下过一场大雨，山水漫垅泄下，像一条河流，简直看不见田岸。这时，由各管理区、生产队临时抽调来的干部和突击队员，陆续地到齐了。我们马上找来一些人，在垅底一块田里插上了“样板田”的牌子，脱了鞋子跳下水，动手干起来了。在这里种过四十多年田的老农刘老爹连忙跑来，他用惊奇的眼光打量着我说：“李书记，公社在这里搞‘样板’呀？”我说：“是啊！你看能行吗？”老人激动地说：“有党的领导该是冷泉碑翻身的年月啦！”他又沉思起来，接着又说：“不过，这垅光靠追肥不行，得要从根治，把山水堵断，把冷泉的水放走才行。”老人的说法启发了我们。办法就是：见泉围堰，开沟排水；沿山开渠，加高田岸；叫泉水不落田，山水不进垅，肥水不出田，水田多压青肥，改良土壤。
    一千名劳动大军，都在两边山坡、村庄方圆十里的地方，扎下了大营，遍野红旗招展，人声欢腾，“一切为了平衡增产”的巨幅标语也在大路口竖起来了，冷泉碑变成了热浪滔滔的战场。
    围“龙头”的那股大泉眼，是一场大战。刚从水利工地上的“英雄洞”（一条穿山渠道）调来支援冷泉碑的青年突击队纷纷报名参战。以共青团支部书记王子诚为首的十五个青年小伙子，磨拳擦掌地要求治这个龙头泉，担任拔除在“龙头”上一棵大树的光荣任务。大家齐动手拔树的时候，王子诚笑着说：“你们留点心，说不定还会拔出一条龙来哩！”袁毛头也笑着说：“拔出龙来更好，我正要找这个害人精算账呢。”说得大家哈哈大笑，轰的一声，树被拔上来了。只见一股刺骨的冷水向外直冒，冰得大家直打哆嗦，可是小伙子们没有一人退阵、咬紧牙关，站在冷水中，开沟的开沟，围岸的围岸，坚持战斗两个小时，终于把这股泉水制服了，乖乖地沿着新开的渠道流进了大排水沟去。
    十天后，冷泉碑的面貌大为改观。新开的五条通垅大渠，长达三千米；逢泉围堰，逢堰开沟，不仅排除了渍水，而且基本上做到了山水不落垅，泉水不泛田，肥水不出田，大泉落大沟，小泉落小沟，小沟通大渠，泉水不停留，提高了地温，防止了肥水流失。一千多条田岸整修一新，光溜的田岸上还破天荒地种上了黄豆。
    接着，又以五天的时间，五百名劳动大军，突击插完了千亩早稻秧，要比往年提前半个月，在季节上赶上了先进地区。秧苗落土，又开展了培育管理的竞赛高潮。插秧后的第五天就抢着薅头次草，追头次肥，秧苗一天变个样，盖过了附近的许多大垅大畈。冷泉碑的变化震动了全县，全县各公社纷纷派人来参观，提出向冷泉碑看齐。
    不料，在薅二次草时，垅中间有五十多亩田的秧苗变了卦，秧苗根部发黑，谷叶由青变黄了。社员们齐声保证：“坚决要保住这面红旗！”“要红旗越举越高！”由王冬娥和袁毛头两员猛将率领两个专业管理小组的男女青年，发出保红旗的誓言。于是又掀起了一场治秧的战斗。这时，县委第一书记董舒同志亲自来到这里，他很关心我们改造冷泉碑的斗争，鼓励大家要坚持下去直到最后胜利！田里下了酸性肥料，经过太阳蒸发，把冷浸给全驱散了。冷泉碑永远不冷了，在枯烂的根子周围，又长出了白白嫩嫩的新根，秧苗又转青，发棵分蘖了。
    现在，满垅一片碧浪，稻谷普遍抽穗扬花，香气扑鼻。来往过路的人，谁见了这么好的庄稼，都要啧啧称赞。前天，我碰到刘老爹，他伸出大拇指说：“共产党真有办法，千年落后垅，现在算是大翻身。”（附图片）
