Economic Crop Areas Vigorously Grasp Grain Production
Ruichang County Adopts Effective Measures to Strive for Grain Self-Sufficiency and Surplus
Mengcheng Commune Organizes Labor to Manage Grain and Economic Crops Well

(Our report) Ruichang County, Jiangxi Province, which is rich in economic crops such as cotton and ramie, under the guidance of the thought of taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward, has adopted effective measures to vigorously grasp grain production, determined to achieve bumper harvests of both grain and economic crops and realize grain self-sufficiency and surplus.

The planting area of economic crops in Ruichang County has historically reached about 60%. In the past, the state had to transfer a large amount of grain every year to provide support. In recent years, in order to solve the grain problem through self-reliance, Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over grain production, and grain production has developed rapidly. In 1959, it basically achieved self-sufficiency. However, the people of Ruichang are determined to achieve an all-round leap forward in both grain and economic crops in 1960, so that grain can not only be completely self-sufficient but also have reserves.

The first problem Ruichang County encountered in vigorously developing grain production was the contradiction of grain, cotton, and hemp competing for land. A few people believed that "one hand cannot catch two fish" and advocated reducing the area of economic crops to solve the land competition contradiction; however, the vast majority of people disagreed with this method. They believed that "one hand can catch two fish," that the area of grain crops must be guaranteed, and that the area of economic crops must also be guaranteed. They advocated solving the problem through land reclamation and increasing the area of multiple cropping. The county Party committee adopted the second method, first vigorously grasping the reclamation of wasteland and lakeshore land. The county has reclaimed a total of 100,000 mu of wasteland and lakeshore land, accounting for about one-third of the county's original cultivated land area. Second, it increased the area of multiple cropping and improved land utilization. This year, the county increased its planting area by more than 30,000 mu through the single measure of changing one season to two seasons, basically realizing double-cropping rice. At the same time, it adopted methods such as changing two seasons to three seasons and intercropping tall and short crops, and mixed planting of hemp and grain to expand the area of multiple cropping. This year, the area of multiple cropping in the county increased from 330,000 mu last year to 500,000 mu, and the land utilization rate reached more than 266%.

In order to ensure the simultaneous leap forward of grain and cotton, after the area of ​​cultivation was resolved, the county Party committee focused on water and fertilizer, two basic farmland construction projects. Last winter and this spring, the county launched a vigorous upsurge in water conservancy construction and manure accumulation. To date, the county has built more than 180 new medium-sized and small water conservancy projects, expanding the irrigated area by more than 70,000 mu and improving the irrigated area by 110,000 mu. On the front of manure accumulation and fertilizer production, the vast number of commune members tried every means to open up fertilizer sources, achieving the goal of bringing mountain fertilizer down the mountain, water fertilizer to the shore, mineral fertilizer out of the soil, and household fertilizer out of the door, accumulating and manufacturing a large amount of farm manure. At the same time, more than 1,000 local chemical fertilizer plants were newly built and renovated throughout the county, producing a large number of local chemical fertilizers, ensuring that both economic crops and grain crops had sufficient fertilizer.

At present, the 110,000 mu of early rice throughout the county are generally growing well, and some have begun to be harvested. Cotton and ramie are growing robustly, cotton is generally budding and bolling, and ramie has been completely harvested for the first crop, with output exceeding the original plan.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jiangsu Province, Wujin County, Mengcheng Commune, based on the spirit of "taking grain as the key link and developing in an all-round way," has adopted five measures in vigorously grasping the field management of autumn-ripe crops, comprehensively arranging labor, and ensuring that the commune's twelve agricultural projects are well managed. At present, more than 8,000 mu of mid-season rice in the commune have been cultivated and fertilized twice, and the third fertilization is underway; more than 7,000 mu of late-season rice have generally completed the first cultivation and fertilization, and the second cultivation and fertilization is underway. Economic crops such as hemp, peanuts, tobacco, and sugar beets have also generally been processed, weeded, and fertilized.

How does Mengcheng Commune achieve comprehensive management of grain and economic crops? The main reason is that the commune Party committee has adopted five specific measures in the arrangement of labor. (1) Combining long-term professional teams with short-term professional teams. The labor force for economic crops has been increased from the original 13% to 27%. Long-term professional teams have been established for major economic crops such as forestry, hemp, sericulture, vegetables, and medicinal materials. At the same time, according to the seasonal needs of certain agricultural tasks, short-term professional teams are organized to carry out temporary blitz activities. (2) Organize large-scale cooperation between rice field management labor and economic crop labor, so that professional management is combined with large-scale cooperation. For example, the time for picking safflower, a traditional Chinese medicine, is concentrated, and the flower workers are meticulous. The commune organized large-scale cooperation and blitz activities from rice and other fields. In three days, all 700 mu of safflower in the commune were completely picked and harvested. In the current late-rice manure accumulation, fertilization, and rice borer control, labor is also organized from the economic crop professional team to support late-rice management. (3) Combine agricultural tasks that can be combined to achieve twice the result with half the effort. For example, weeding economic crop fields can be combined with rice manure accumulation and fertilization; weeding mountainsides and forest edges can be combined with planting melons and vegetables in vacant land. The nursery professional team combined forest weeding and accumulated more than 800,000 catties of green manure for late rice in a few days. (4) According to the different seasons and different needs of various crops, labor can be adjusted between rice and economic crops to make up for surpluses and deficiencies. Hemp weeding should be done early, but rice cultivation does not begin until twenty days after planting. In this way, the commune Party committee first concentrated labor to weed the hemp fields, and then transferred labor to cultivate and process the rice fields. In drought resistance, because economic crops are more resistant to drought, labor is drawn from the economic crop professional team to support rice operations. (5) Reform tools, innovate technology, and improve labor productivity.

    经济作物区狠抓粮食生产
    瑞昌县采取有效措施力争粮食自给有余
    孟城公社组织劳力管好粮食和经济作物
    本报讯　盛产棉花、苎麻等经济作物的江西瑞昌县，在以粮为纲全面跃进的思想指导下，采取有效措施大抓粮食生产，决心做到粮食和经济作物齐丰收，实现粮食自给有余。
    瑞昌县经济作物种植面积历年达60％左右，过去每年都要国家调进大批粮食支援。近几年来，各级党委为了自力更生解决粮食问题，加强了对粮食生产的领导，粮食生产有了迅速的发展，1959年基本上达到了自给。但是，瑞昌人民决心在1960年实现粮食和经济作物的全面跃进，粮食不仅要做到完全自给，而且要有储备。
    瑞昌县在大力发展粮食生产时，碰到的第一个问题，就是粮、棉、麻互相争地的矛盾。有少数人认为“一只手不能抓两条鱼”，主张减少经济作物面积来解决争地矛盾；但是，绝大多数人不同意这种办法，他们认为“一只手能抓两条鱼”，粮食作物要保面积，经济作物同样也要保面积，主张通过开荒和增加复种面积等办法来解决。县委采用了第二种办法，首先大抓湖洲荒地的开垦工作，全县共开垦出荒地、湖洲十万亩，约占全县原有耕地面积的三分之一。其次，是增加复种面积，提高土地利用率。今年全县仅通过一季变两季一项措施，即比去年增加了种植面积三万多亩，基本上实现了双季稻化。同时，采取二季变三季和高矮作物套种，麻、粮混种等办法，扩大复种面积。今年，全县复种面积在去年三十三万亩的基础上增加到了五十万亩，土地利用率达266％以上。
    为了保证粮、棉齐跃进，县委在种植面积问题解决后，狠抓了水肥两项农田基本建设。去冬今春，全县掀起了大兴水利，大积肥料的热潮。至今全县共新建了中小型水利工程一百八十多座，扩大灌溉面积七万多亩，改善灌溉面积十一万多亩。在积肥造肥战线上，广大社员千方百计开辟肥料来源，做到了山肥下山、水肥上岸、矿肥出土、家肥出门，积造了大量农家肥料，同时全县各地还新建和改建了一千多个土化肥厂，大量制造了各种土化肥，保证了经济作物和粮食作物都有足够的肥料。
    目前，全县十一万亩早稻普遍生长良好，部分已开镰收割。棉花和苎麻生长健壮，棉花普遍现蕾结桃，苎麻已全部收完头道麻，产量超过原订计划。
    据新华社讯　江苏省武进县孟城公社根据“以粮为纲，全面发展”的精神，在狠抓秋熟田间管理中，采取五项措施，全面安排劳动力，保证了全社农业十二个项目，项项田间管理都搞得很好。目前，全社八千多亩中稻已经耘耥追肥两次，正在进行第三次追肥；七千多亩晚稻已普遍结束第一次耘耥追肥，正在进行第二次耘耥追肥。大麻、花生、烟草和甜菜等经济作物，也普遍进行了加工除草和追肥。
    孟城公社如何做到粮食和经济作物全面管好呢？主要是公社党委在劳动力的安排上采取了五项具体措施。（1）长期专业队与短期专业队相结合。将经济作物劳力从原来13％增加到27％。对经济作物中的主要项目如林业、大麻、蚕桑、蔬菜、药材等，都建立了长期专业队。同时根据某些农活的季节性需要，组织短期专业队进行临时性的突击活动。（2）组织水稻田间管理劳力与经济作物劳力大协作，做到专业专管与大协作相结合。如中药红花，摘花瓣的时间集中，花工又细，公社就组织水稻和其他方面的劳力大协作、大突击。三天时间就将全社七百多亩红花全部摘收完。在当前的晚稻积肥、追肥和治螟中，又从经济作物的专业队中，组织劳力支援晚稻管理。（3）可以结合的农活就结合进行，做到事半功倍。如经济作物田除草与水稻积肥、追肥可以相结合；山边、林边除草与利用空闲地种植瓜菜相结合。苗圃专业队结合林间除草，几天时间，就为晚稻积绿肥八十多万斤。（4）根据各种作物的不同季节和不同需要，将水稻和经济作物两方面的劳力实行余缺调剂。大麻除草要早，但水稻种后二十天才耘耥。这样，公社党委就首先集中劳力给大麻田除草，然后再调劳力为稻田耘耥加工。在抗旱中，由于经济作物抗旱力较强，就从经济作物专业队抽劳力支援水稻作业。（5）改革工具，革新技术，提高劳动生产率。
