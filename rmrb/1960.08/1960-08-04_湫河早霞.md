    Morning Glow over the Qiu River
    Wang Dezhi, First Secretary of the Lin County Party Committee, Shanxi Province

    In the morning, I strolled along the bank of the Qiu River, gazing out at the rows of neat willow trees on both sides reflected in the calm water. The river water, flowing through the intersecting channels, large and small, entered the neat, small plots, quenching the thirst of the crops and nourishing the tens of thousands of mu of farmland along the banks, enabling them to grow vigorously. The undulating mountains on both sides, stacked with countless terraces reaching straight into the clouds, displayed golden waves of wheat swaying back and forth, presenting a scene of abundant harvest.
    These enchanting scenes are unimaginable to those who have never been to the mountainous areas. I was lost in thought, and couldn't help but say to myself:
    "Qiu River! Qiu River, since the day you were born, there hasn't been a year without floods. You often wash away the fruits of the laboring people's hard work for a year, how can people not feel heartache? No wonder that until the Great Leap Forward, the 310,000 people of Lin County had no good feelings towards you at all..."
    I clearly remember one day in August 1951 when the Qiu River flooded, the water poured into the east gate of the city, as high as half the city wall. All the crops along the banks were washed away, houses collapsed, and there were shouts of people and neighs of horses. It was the first major flood in nearly a hundred years. Under the care of the Party, the state transferred large quantities of grain and materials from all over the country. The people of Lin County ate grain sent by farmers from eight provinces and cities across the country. Thinking of this, how could our 310,000 people not be grateful to the Party?
    Opening the "Old County Chronicles of Lin County," there is the following record: "On June 16th of the first year of Guangxu (1875 AD), the Qiu River flooded, boundless on both banks, destroying the river embankment, reaching several feet high on the city wall, entering the second street of the city, houses collapsed, people were swept away, and the autumn harvest was poor, leading to famine. People pulled up grass roots and ate wild vegetables to fill their stomachs. A斗 of rice cost two taels of silver, and black beans cost one tael and three qian. More than a thousand people starved to death." Such a great disaster, but who in that dark society at the time cared? People have long circulated such a folk song: "Qiu River, Qiu River, use water to dry up the river beach, with water push the crops, drought and flood cause no harvest, the people on both banks suffer, who can we tell the deep suffering to, the tears of the people flow into a river."
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the brave and hardworking people of Lin County were determined to conquer this harmful river. In 1958, the Lin County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call to the people of the county to "completely control the Qiu River and build a reservoir in Yangpo." This call, like a spring thunder, excited the people's hearts. The people of the county clapped their hands and jumped for joy, preparing their equipment and preparing for battle. On April 1st, the construction of the reservoir officially began in Yangpo. More than a thousand laborers camped and set up camp. After the birth of the People's Commune in August, it exerted its great power, and the number of laborers increased to more than 11,000, determined to cut off this dragon in the shortest possible time.
    On the reservoir construction site, thousands of heroes, with soaring revolutionary zeal, after a year and three months of hard work, leveled six surrounding hills, built a huge dam, connected Black Check Mountain and Dong Mountain, suppressed the Qiu River dragon, and built the first treasure house of the people of Lin County.
    The completion of the Yangpo Reservoir is the crystallization of the sweat and wisdom of the people of Lin County under the leadership of the Party. The water flowing down from the upper reaches of this reservoir is regulated by the aqueduct and flows smoothly to the lower reaches. Since June 1st of this year, the reservoir has met the irrigation needs of more than 30,000 mu of hemp skin and vegetables along the banks. Following the Qiu River downstream, large and small channels with clear water flowing constantly can be seen everywhere. Boiler-mounted machines and diesel engines are running day and night, lifting this constant flow of water to the top of mountains dozens of feet high to irrigate the fields. The 120-li-long winding mountain canal is about to be completed, and then nearly 100,000 mu of fertile land along the banks will all receive irrigation from the reservoir. The power station next to the flood control dam has already begun construction, and fish farming is being recorded in the history of Lin County for the first time. A brand new look will appear throughout the mountainous area.
    The evergreen Qiu River flows slowly south, and the people on both banks are rejoicing. Loud songs break through the silent valley. The banks of the Qiu River will forever reverberate with the happy songs of the people of Lin County singing of Chairman Mao and singing of the Communist Party.

    湫河早霞	中共山西临县县委第一书记　王德滋
    早晨，我漫步在湫河沿岸眺望，两岸一排排整齐的杨柳树倒映在平静的水里。河水顺着穿插的大小渠道，流进了整齐的块块小畦、送进了干渴的庄苗口中，滋养着沿岸数万亩田禾，使它们茁壮生长。左右两边起伏的群山，重叠着无数台阶直升云端，一层层金黄色的麦浪在摇头摆尾，呈现着一幅丰收的景象。
    这些迷人的景象，没有到过山区的人们，是怎么也想不到的。我看得出神了，情不自禁地自言自语起来：
  “湫水啊！湫水，从你诞生的那天起，没有一年不泛滥，你常常把劳动人民辛苦一年的劳动果实一冲而光，怎能不让人心疼呢？难怪直到大跃进以前，临县三十一万人民对你没有一点好感……。”
    我清楚地记得1951年8月的一天，湫河泛滥，河水涌进城东门，高达半城墙，沿岸庄稼全部冲走，房倒屋塌，人喊马嘶，遭了近百年来第一次大水灾。在党的关怀下，国家给我们从山南海北调来大批粮食、物资，临县人民吃到了全国八个省、市农民兄弟送来的粮食。想起这些，我们三十一万人民怎能不对党万分感激呢？
    翻开《临县旧县志》，有这样一段记载：光绪元年（公元1875年）6月16日，湫河泛滥，两岸无边，冲坏河堤，高达城墙数尺，进入城市二道街，房倒屋塌，人推走，秋后粮食欠收，发生饥荒，拔草根，吃野菜，填充肚皮，斗米银二两，黑豆一两三，饿死千余人。这么大的灾害，可是当时的黑暗社会有谁管呢？人们长期以来流传着这样一首民谣：“湫水，湫水，用水干河滩，有水推庄稼，天旱雨涝没收成，两岸人民遭祸根，海深的苦处对谁说，百姓的眼泪流成河”。
    解放以后，在党的领导下，勇敢勤劳的临县人民决心征服这条害河。1958年中共临县县委向全县人民发出了“彻底根治湫河，在阳坡修建水库”的号召。这一号召像春雷似的激动着人心，全县人民拍手欢跳，整装备器，准备征战。4月1日水库在阳坡正式开始修建，一千余民工安营扎寨，铺兵摆阵。8月间人民公社诞生后，发挥了它的巨大威力，民工增加到一万一千余人，决心在最短的时间内斩断这条蛟龙。
    在水库工地上成千上万的英雄们，以冲天的革命干劲，经过一年零三个月的苦战，削平了周围六个山头，筑起了一条巨坝，把黑查山和洞山连起来，镇住了湫河蛟龙，建成了临县人民的第一个宝库。
    阳坡水库的建成，是临县人民在党的领导下汗珠与智慧的结晶。这座水库把上游流下的水经过输水道规规矩矩流到下游，从今年6月1日起，水库满足了沿岸三万余亩麻皮、蔬菜的浇灌用水。沿着湫河顺水而下，到处可以看到大小渠道青水常流，锅驼机、柴油机在昼夜不停，把这常流水提到数十丈高的山顶浇灌田苗。长达一百二十华里的盘山大渠即将完工，那时沿岸近十万亩良田，全部接受水库浇灌。拦洪坝边的发电站早已开始兴建，养鱼事业在临县第一次载入史卷，整个山区面貌将要出现一片崭新的景象。
    常青的湫水缓缓南流，两岸人民一片欢腾，嘹亮的歌声冲破了寂静的山谷。湫河两岸永远震响着临县人民歌唱毛主席、歌唱共产党的幸福之歌。
