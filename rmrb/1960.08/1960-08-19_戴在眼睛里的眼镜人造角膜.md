    Although common nearsighted patients can now have their vision restored with glasses, in some cases, ordinary glasses are still inconvenient. Not only are some nearsighted patients unable to wear glasses due to their profession, but there are also some vision defects that ordinary glasses cannot correct. For example, if the light entering the eyeball produces irregular refraction due to eyeball malformation or corneal trauma, even if ordinary glasses are worn, it is still impossible to converge the image onto the retina, and thus impossible to form a clear image. Some people cannot find suitable glasses because their nearsightedness is too severe. Some people have a significant difference in vision between their two eyes, and even with glasses, the images received by the two eyes will be inconsistent. The "invisible glasses" mentioned below—also known as artificial corneas—are designed to compensate for the shortcomings of ordinary glasses.

    The artificial cornea is a thin shell made of optical glass, shaped like half a longan shell, and is placed directly on the eye when used. "Doesn't it hurt?" some may ask. Even the smallest foreign object in the eye can cause tears of pain, let alone such a large object being placed in the eye?

    Let practice answer this question. The famous Carl Zeiss optical instrument factory in the German Democratic Republic has produced a suitable artificial cornea. This device does not cause any stinging or discomfort when placed in the eye, nor does it cause any other eye diseases. This artificial cornea consists of a central refractive part (corneal part) and a surrounding edge part (scleral part). The function of the edge part is to ensure that the glasses are firmly covered on the eye, while the middle part, which is ground into a spherical shape, is the only part that actually plays a corrective role. Between the artificial cornea and the human cornea, a layer of crystalline lens is formed by tears or physiological saline dripped in when the artificial cornea is inserted. The refractive index of this layer of crystalline lens is the same as that of the original cornea. In this way, the artificial cornea assumes the task of the defective cornea.

    Because the artificial cornea rests on the soft fatty pad of the eye and is protected by the eyelids and eye socket, it is extremely difficult to be damaged even on a soccer field. Because the artificial cornea is close to the eye, the field of vision is not limited by the size of the lens like wearing ordinary glasses, and it has the same field of vision as normal eyes.

### 戴在眼睛里的眼镜人造角膜

    戴在眼睛里的眼镜人造角膜
    一般的近视患者现在虽然已经可以通过眼镜获得视力恢复，但是在有些情况下，普通的眼镜仍然是使人感到不方便的。不仅仅由于职业原因使有些近视患者不能戴眼镜，而且还有一些视力缺陷是普通眼镜不能补救的。例如，如果由于眼球畸形或由于角膜受过创伤，进入眼球的光线产生不规则的折射，纵使戴上普通眼镜，还是无法使物像汇聚到网膜上去，也就不可能构成清晰的物像。也有些人由于近视度数太深而配不到合适的眼镜。也有些人由于两眼视力相差悬殊，尽管配上眼镜还会产生两眼接收的物像不一致的毛病。下面所谈的“看不见的眼镜”——或称人造角膜，就是为了弥补普通眼镜的缺点的。
    人造角膜是一种用光学玻璃合成的薄壳，外形很像半瓣龙眼壳，使用时直接安在眼睛上。“这样不疼吗？”或许有人会问，眼睛里即使落入了极小的异物就会使人疼得直流泪水，何况在眼睛里放入这么大一块东西呢？
    让实践来回答这个问题。德意志民主共和国著名的蔡司光学仪器厂已经制成一种适用的人造角膜，这种东西装在眼睛里并不会引起什么刺痛或不舒服的感觉，也不会引起其它什么眼疾。这种人造角膜是由中央的折光部分（角膜部分）和四周的边缘部分（巩膜部分）组成的。边缘部分的作用是保证眼镜牢靠地复盖在眼睛上，而真正起矫视作用的只是磨成球形的中间部分。在人造角膜和人眼角膜之间，由泪液或在人造角膜装入时滴入的生理食盐水形成一层水晶体，这层水晶体的折射率同原来角膜相同。这样，人造角膜就承担起有缺陷的角膜的任务了。
    由于人造角膜枕在眼睛的柔软的脂肪垫上并且受到眼皮和眼窝的保护，所以即使在足球场，也极难受到任何损伤。由于人造角膜紧贴在眼睛上，所以不会像戴上普通眼镜那样视野受到镜面大小的限制，而具有和正常眼睛相同的视野。
