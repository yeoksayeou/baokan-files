    A Touchstone	Wu Lü
    How to treat the product variety plan stipulated by the state is a touchstone for examining whether enterprise cadres have a global perspective in organizing production.
    Completing the product variety plan stipulated by the state is an important part of comprehensively completing the state plan. The purpose of our production is to meet needs. And needs, whether for national construction or for the people's livelihood, are specific and are expressed through requirements for the quantity and quality of different varieties of products. Abstracting the specific content of product varieties, the so-called "need" becomes an elusive thing. Is steel needed, or iron? Is this kind of steel needed, or that kind of steel? If this premise is not affirmed, there is no way to talk about meeting needs. It can be seen that completing the product variety plan stipulated by the state is the basis for completing the product quantity plan and quality indicators. Only when the produced product varieties are suitable for the needs of national construction and the people's livelihood, the quantity and quality of such products have meaning.
    Completing the plan according to the varieties stipulated by the state is unconditional. Products with large output value, large quantity, readily available equipment and materials, and relatively mature technology must be produced. Products with relatively small output value, small quantity, unavailable equipment and materials, and technology that needs to be learned from scratch must also be produced.
    What we advocate is to organize a mass movement of high-quality and high-yield production in accordance with the varieties and specifications stipulated by the state, and to complete and overfulfill the output value plan on this basis. This is the global perspective of completing the state plan. Of course, some varieties have relatively small output value and small quantity, especially some new products, which require adjusting equipment, preparing new tools and fixtures, and a process of skill acquisition in technology before they can be put into mass production. This will add some trouble to the production arrangement of enterprises. Precisely because of these troubles, ensuring the completion of the product variety plan stipulated by the state is a valuable global perspective. The several news items from Shenyang, Shanghai, Beijing, and other places published in this newspaper today prove that as long as we establish a global perspective and take practical and effective measures, the various difficulties in multi-variety production and the introduction of new products can be solved, and the comprehensive completion of the state plan and the continuous expansion of product varieties can certainly be achieved.

    一颗试金石	吴滤
    怎样对待国家规定的产品品种计划，是考察企业干部在组织生产中有没有全局观点的一颗试金石。
    完成国家规定的产品品种计划，是全面完成国家计划的一个重要内容。我们生产的目的是为了满足需要。而需要，不管是国家建设的需要，还是人民生活的需要，都是具体的，是通过对不同品种的产品数量和质量要求表现出来的。抽去了产品品种的具体内容，所谓“需要”就变成不可捉摸的东西了。是需要钢、还是需要铁？是需要这一种钢、还是需要那一种钢？如果不肯定这个前提，就谈不到满足需要。可见，完成国家规定的产品品种计划，是完成产品数量计划和质量指标的基础。只有生产的产品品种，是适合国家建设和人民生活需要的，这种产品的数量和质量才有意义。
    按照国家规定的品种完成计划，是无条件的。产值大的、数量大的、设备和材料都凑手、技术已经比较熟练的产品，要干。产值比较小的，数量比较小的，设备和材料都不凑手，技术上又需要从头学起的产品，也要干。
    我们提倡的，是按照国家规定的品种、规格，组织优质高产的群众运动，在这个基础上完成和超额完成产值计划。这才是完成国家计划的全局观点。当然，有一些品种，产值比较小，数量也比较少，特别是有一些新产品，要成批地投入生产，还需要调整设备，准备新的工卡具，技术上也需要有一个熟练的过程，会给企业的生产安排增加一些麻烦。也正因为有这样一些麻烦，保证完成国家规定的产品品种计划，才是一种可贵的全局观点。今天本报发表的沈阳、上海、北京等地的几条消息，证明了只要树立全局观点，采取切实有效的措施，多品种生产和新产品投入生产中的各种困难都是可以解决的，全面完成国家计划，并且不断地扩大产品品种，是一定可以做到的。
