A Good Commune Member of the People's Commune

    Wang Liujin, known as "Commune Obsessed Mind," is a 55-year-old ordinary member of the Xiaotao Management District of Jiacun Commune in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province. Because he cares about the commune in everything and loves the collective everywhere, people gave him such a glorious nickname.
    Wang Liujin never knows fatigue when he works. He never walks empty-handed in the fields, picking up manure along the way. After work, he also brings back a bundle of grass for the livestock. In order to turn the barren hills near the village into orchards with flowers in all seasons, he has traveled around to learn about tree planting experience and find tree species, so that walnuts, peppers, apples and other trees can take root and sprout in Xiaotao Village. In the past two years, he has cultivated more than 260,000 seedlings. He wholeheartedly serves the collective, does a lot of work and does it well, but he never cares about remuneration, and never tells anyone about the odd jobs he does. He said: "Serving the commune is serving myself. How can we separate things so clearly?"

    “社迷心”
    被人们称为“社迷心”的王六斤，是山西万荣县贾村小桃管理区的一个五十五岁普通社员。因为他事事关心公社，处处热爱集体，人们才给他起了这样一个光荣绰号。
    王六斤干起活来从来不知疲倦，下地走路不空行，沿路拾粪。劳动完回家，还给牲口捎一捆草。他为了使村旁的荒山秃岭变成四季花香的果园，曾外出四处访问，寻找种树经验和树种，使核桃、花椒、苹果等树都在小桃村生根发芽。两年来，他培育的树苗就有二十六万多株。他全心全意为集体，干活又多又好，可是他从不计较报酬，干了杂活从不对人说。他说：“给社里办事就是给自己办事，那能粥是粥、水是水，分得那么清楚。”
