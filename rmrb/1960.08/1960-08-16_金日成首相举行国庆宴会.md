Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 15th: Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kim Il-sung, held a grand banquet tonight at the newly built Okryu Hall in Pyongyang to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the "August 15th" Korean Liberation.

Among those attending the banquet were leading members of the Korean Workers' Party and the government such as Choi Yong-kun, Kim Il, Hong Myung-hee, Park Jung-ae, Park Kim-chul, Kim Chang-man, Jung Il-ryong, and Nam Il, as well as heads of various democratic parties and social organizations, figures from the scientific, cultural, and artistic circles, labor heroes, leaders of the Chollima work teams, and representatives of the working people.

The entire members of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association delegation headed by Li Dequan and the Soviet-Korean Friendship Association delegation headed by An Do-shin, who were invited to participate in the "August 15th" 15th anniversary of the Korean Liberation celebration ceremonies, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to North Korea also attended the banquet.

Premier Kim Il-sung delivered a speech at the banquet. In his speech, he extended warm festive congratulations to all the working people in North Korea and expressed solidarity with the South Korean people who are fighting for survival and democratic rights.

Premier Kim Il-sung said that in the past fifteen years, there has been a great transformation in the history of our people, and the face of our country has been completely renewed. Our country, which was backward and poor in the past, has today been transformed into a socialist country with an independent national industrial base and completed agricultural collectivization. Kim Il-sung said that all the achievements our people have made in the cause of building a new society are inseparable from the assistance of the people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

The great Soviet Union liberated our people from the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism and has consistently given us material and spiritual assistance. The Chinese people aided us with their blood and continue to provide enormous assistance to our construction endeavors. The people of all fraternal countries have sincerely assisted us. Here, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the people of the fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union.

He said that our people are now embarking on the path of implementing magnificent and promising tasks. Our people, more firmly united around the Party, will surely achieve great victories in the struggle for socialist construction and the promotion of the peaceful reunification of the motherland with new courage.

Premier Kim Il-sung finally proposed a toast for the happiness and prosperity of the Korean people, for the peaceful reunification and prosperous development of Korea, for the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, and for world peace.

Soviet Ambassador to North Korea, Puzanov, and the head of the diplomatic corps in North Korea, Chinese Ambassador to North Korea, Qiao Xiaoguang, delivered speeches at the banquet, extending warm congratulations to the Korean people.
