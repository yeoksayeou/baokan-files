    Solving Problems On the Spot: Deeply, Thoroughly, and Quickly
	Li Lian, First Secretary of the CCP Ruicheng County Committee, Shanxi

		July 13th

    After working in the No. 3 Production Team of the Nanzhang Management Area of the Nanwei Commune for a few days, I discovered two kinds of work methods among the cadres who had come down [to the countryside]: One was that they had great enthusiasm, but only busied themselves with labor from dawn till dusk, doing little to discover problems, solve problems, or summarize and promote experiences from their work. The other was that they couldn’t sit still, running around here and there all day long, rarely helping the grassroots cadres solve specific problems. At the same time, I also discovered that the team cadres were entangled in the routine of assigning work and calling people, so busy that they couldn’t spare time to study the overall work of the team. How to be a good "advisor" to the team cadres, and how the team cadres can do their work well, is a problem that all cadres must solve first after going deep into the front line.

    In response to this situation, my comrades and I, one evening, took the time to study this problem together with all the team cadres and all the work groups here. The result of the study was to determine that we would all be specifically assigned to certain jobs, going deep into the fields, working while helping to solve problems. I took the position of deputy captain and, with Chen Junzhe, was responsible for field management and setting quotas. Qu Tingzhan was responsible for animal husbandry management. Liu Xuezhen, Wang Yunzhong, Zhang Qin, and Zhao Wuzi went deep into the kitchen to serve as stewards and cooks. Ye Xiangtang was responsible for political and ideological education. The team cadres were also assigned tasks in the same way. After several days of practical exploration, we summarized a set of "seven-one-two-four" and "learn, do, research, confer" working methods. That is, during the seven days, we labor during the day, and take time in the evening to learn, meet, and research work. In terms of time allocation, one evening is spent discussing work with the branch committee, two evenings are spent holding meetings (a mass meeting is held on Thursday evening, and a party and Youth League members' life meeting is held on Sunday evening), and the remaining four evenings are spent studying. "Learn" means learning theory, pinyin, and agricultural production technology together with the commune members. "Do" means laboring together with the commune members, participating in production, and guiding production. "Research" means using Monday evening to summarize the work of the previous week and arrange the tasks for the next week with the cadres. "Confer" means meeting with the team cadres every day after meals to understand the progress of production on that day. Through the implementation of this working method, all cadres are required to achieve four competencies in a short period of time, that is, be able to carry out field management centered on the "three guarantees and one reward" labor quota system, be able to serve as stewards and cooks, learn agricultural production technology, and be able to feed livestock. The team cadres all reflected: Now we have a clear idea, we are more proactive in our work, efficiency has been improved, and a new atmosphere of vigor and vitality has appeared in our work.

    This management area has a total of twenty-six production teams, of which seventeen are located in waterlogged areas. Every day, there are more than 300 mu of paddy fields to be planted, and there are 355 mu of vegetable fields, 430 mu of cotton in paddy fields, and more than 6,000 mu of autumn grain crops that have been sown and emerged, all of which need to be strengthened. There are still more than 6,000 mu of summer fallow tasks. With so much farm work squeezed together, each laborer has to manage an average of 9.9 mu of land, which is impossible to manage. Some cadres of the management area and production teams are as anxious as ants on a hot pot, with no way to solve the problem. On the contrary, the nine production teams living in the dry areas, in addition to replanting a small portion of autumn grain crops in the seventeen waterlogged teams, have nothing else to do.

    How to rationally use labor? This needs to be solved immediately. While continuing the anti-drought replanting, the word "management" must be implemented immediately to earnestly strengthen field management. This is a problem that needs to be solved immediately. Therefore, we personally went deep down to investigate the base of farm work and labor of each team; on the other hand, we studied this issue with the management committee and all the work groups. After repeated calculations of labor, tasks, and time, we finally decided to draw 226 laborers and 112 livestock from the dry area teams to "set up camp" in the waterlogged areas, and adopt two methods for field management to "manage" until harvest. One is joint management, working together, harvesting together, and distributing together in the fall. The other is a fixed professional team, demarcating plots of land and implementing contracting for work and output, and managing separately. The commune members unanimously reflected: Now we can rest assured, the responsibility is clear, and we have a grasp of things when we get to the fields. Production is on the right track.

    These days, while working in the fields, I have found that some commune members are not active enough in their work, arriving late and leaving early, and taking too long breaks during work. The reason is mainly that there is no labor quota and the responsibility is not clear enough. When we were weeding cotton in Dongnian, we began to implement labor quotas, four rows per mu, one point for weeding one row. As a result, work efficiency was improved. Then, we further divided the entire team's labor force into three mobile operation groups according to the current farm work, one group responsible for summer fallow, one group for managing cotton, and one group for managing autumn fields. From then on, the captain no longer had to call or wait for people when going to the fields.

    After discussing this method with the management committee, we immediately established a contracting for work and output quota research committee, and promoted it throughout the district three days later.

    The steamed buns this morning were not well made, and everyone had a lot of opinions. How to improve the rate of cooking, the rate of attendance [at meals], and the variety of food, so that the commune members can eat their fill, eat well, and eat economically, is a central issue in improving living conditions. During this period, we went deep into the canteen and deep into the mill, assisting the cooks and millers of the production team. After modifying the steamers, stoves, and sieves, the original 100 jin of wheat could only grind 93 jin of flour, but now it grinds 95 jin. Originally, a pot of noodles required 33 jin of flour, but now it only takes 27 jin. In this way, not only can we eat our fill and eat well, but we also save 11 jin of grain every day.

    Later, the canteens of six or seven teams came to learn automatically. We immediately held an on-site meeting and promoted this experience. Currently, with the third team's canteen as the center, a red banner canteen and red banner mill competition is underway.

    现场解决问题深透快	中共山西芮城县委第一书记  李琏		    7月13日
    在南磑公社南张管理区第三生产队，劳动了几天，发现下去的干部在工作方法上有两种情况：一种是劲头很大，但起早摸黑只顾劳动，如何发现问题，解决问题，总结推广工作中的经验，却做得很少；一种是坐不下来，整天是这里跑跑，那里看看，很少帮助基层干部解决具体问题。同时还发现队干部整天纠缠在派活、叫人的事务圈子里，忙得不可开交，顾不上研究全队工作。究竟如何当好队干部的“参谋”，队干部如何做好工作，这是所有干部在深入第一线后，首先要解决的一个问题。
    针对这一情况，我和一块下来的同志，就抽了个晚上时间和所有队干部，连同在这里的所有工作组，共同在一块把这个问题研究了一次。研究的结果，确定我们都具体分工担任一定的工作，深入田间，一边劳动，一边帮助解决问题。我担任了副队长，和陈俊哲负责田间管理，制订定额；曲廷湛负责了饲养管理工作；刘学珍、王允忠、张钦、赵五子深入灶房，担任了事务长和炊事员；叶向唐负责政治思想教育；几个队干部也同样进行了分工。经过这几天的实际摸索，总结出一套“七一二四”和“学、干、研、碰”的工作方法。即七天当中，白天劳动，抽晚上时间学习、开会、研究工作，在时间支配上，一个晚上和支部委员会讨论工作，两个晚上开会（星期四晚上召开群众会，星期日晚上召开党、团员生活会），其余四个晚上学习。“学”是和社员在一起学理论、汉语拼音和农业生产技术；“干”是和社员在一起劳动，参加生产，指导生产；“研”是利用星期一的晚上和干部在一起，总结上一周的工作，布置下一周的任务；“碰”是每天饭后和队干部碰一次头，了解当天生产进度情况。通过这一工作方法的贯彻执行，要求所有干部，在很短时间内达到四会，即会搞以三包一奖推行劳动定额为中心的田间管理，会当事务长和炊事员，学会农业生产技术，会喂牲口。队干部一致反映说：这一下心中有数啦，工作主动了，效率提高了，工作上出现了生龙活虎的新气象。
                        7月14日
    这个管理区共有二十六个生产队，其中有十七个生产队住在水地区。每天有三百多亩水地要下种，有三百五十五亩菜地、四百三十亩水地棉花和已下种出土的六千多亩秋粮作物，都需要加强管理，伏耕任务还有六千多亩。这么多的农活挤在一起，每个劳力平均要管理九亩九分地，无论如何也管理不过来。管理区和生产队的部分干部急得像热锅上的蚂蚁，没有办法解决。相反，住在旱地区的九个生产队，除了在十七个水地队补种了一少部分秋粮作物外，再没有别的事干。
    究竟如何合理使用劳力？需要马上解决。在开展继续抗旱补种的同时，“管”字立即上马，认真加强田间管理，这是摆在眉梢上需要立即解决的一个问题。于是，我们一面亲自深入下去，摸各队农活和劳动力的底子；一面和管理委员会以及所有工作组，研究了这一问题。经过反复算劳力，算任务，算时间，最后还是决定从旱地区队抽了二百二十六个劳力，一百一十二头牲口到水地区“安营下寨”，采用两种办法，进行田间管理，一下“管”到丰收。一种是合伙管理，做在一块，收在一块，秋后分在一块；另一种是固定专业队伍，划出地块，实行包工包产，分开管理。社员们一致反映说：这一下心可安下了，责任明确了，到了地里有了抓头。生产一下上了轨道。
                        7月15日
    这几天，在田间劳动时发现一部分社员劳动不够积极，上地晚，收工早，作活中休息时间过长。追其原因，主要是劳动没有定额，责任也不够明确。我们就在东捻地锄棉花的时候，开始实行了劳动定额，四垅一亩，锄一垅一分。结果，提高了工效。接着，我们又进一步把全队劳力，根据当前农活划分成三个流动作业小组，一个组负责伏耕，一个组管理棉花，一个组管理秋田。从此，队长下地时再不叫人等人了。
    这一办法和管理委员会研究后，马上成立了包工包产定额研究委员会，三天以后在全区普遍推广开了。
                        7月17日
    今天早上馍蒸得不够好，大家很有意见。如何提高作饭率，出面率，饭菜花样多，使社员吃饱、吃好、吃省，这是搞好生活的一个中心问题。这一段我们深入食堂，深入磨房，协助生产队的炊事人员、磨面的，经过改笼、改灶、改箩以后，原来一百斤麦子只能磨九十三斤面，现在磨到九十五斤；原来一锅面条需要三十三斤面，现在只用二十七斤。这样，不仅吃得饱、吃得好，而且每天还节约粮食十一斤。
    以后，就有六、七个队的食堂自动前来学习。我们随即召开了现场会，推广了这一经验。目前已以第三队食堂为中心，开展了红旗食堂和红旗磨房竞赛运动。
