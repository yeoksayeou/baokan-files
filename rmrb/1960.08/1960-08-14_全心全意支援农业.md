    Wholeheartedly Support Agriculture
    Reading the news about how all sectors of industry, transportation, commerce, education, and the military in Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, are fully supporting agriculture, it is as if a vivid picture of a massive army fighting tensely to support agriculture is unfolding before people's eyes, which is very exciting.
    The fact that all sectors in Jincheng County are supporting agriculture on such a large scale not only shows that the movement to support agriculture across the country is developing towards a comprehensive and in-depth stage, but also shows that any department and any worker in the national economy can undertake appropriate tasks in supporting agriculture and contribute to accelerating its development.
    The importance of taking agriculture as the foundation and developing agriculture more rapidly for the overall development of the national economy and the acceleration of socialist construction is now understood by more and more people. However, it cannot be said that all industries, departments, and all people have a deep understanding of this. Some people know that supporting agriculture is important, but they also feel that supporting agriculture conflicts with the work of their own department, and they always feel that it is not cost-effective, so they do not show wholehearted support for agriculture. There are indeed some conflicts between supporting agriculture and departmental work. Taking the industrial sector as an example, manufacturing various means of production for agriculture generally has a lower output value and is highly seasonal. Especially when starting to arrange production, it is inevitable to encounter some difficulties. For example, after some agencies withdraw a large number of cadres to support agriculture, it may temporarily affect the work of some departments, and so on. These are all contradictions.
    However, the results of how people deal with contradictions are not the same. Should we only consider the interests of one department or one unit, avoid contradictions in work, regard supporting agriculture as an extra burden, or even adopt an attitude of indifference? Or should we muster our energy and try our best to solve contradictions, so that the work of our own department can adapt to the needs based on agriculture to the greatest extent possible? Adopting the former attitude is convenient for an industry or a department, but it is obviously not conducive to accelerating the development of agriculture. In fact, if agriculture does not develop greatly, how can the work of all walks of life continue to leap forward? Adopting the latter attitude may temporarily lead to some contradictions in work and also encounter some difficulties, but as long as concrete measures are actively taken, contradictions can be continuously resolved, and a new situation of continuous leap forward will appear in the work. The fact that all sectors in Jincheng County have fully supported agriculture and, in a very short period of time, not only accelerated the process of agricultural technological transformation in the county, changed the face of agricultural production in backward areas to a certain extent, but also greatly improved the ideological level of the vast number of cadres and improved their work style, so that the work of all sectors simultaneously showed a new look of continuous leap forward, is a very convincing example.
    Firmly establish the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, and wholeheartedly give agriculture more, greater, and more comprehensive support from manpower, material resources, and technology, so that agriculture can develop faster. This is a common and urgent task for all sectors of the national economy.

    全心全意支援农业
    读了山西晋城县工、交、商、学、兵各行各业全力支援农业的新闻，仿佛在人们面前展现了一幅千军万马为支援农业而紧张奋战的生动图景，令人十分兴奋。
    晋城县各行各业以如此巨大规模支援农业的事实，不仅说明了全国各地支援农业的运动正在向着一个全面、深入阶段发展，同时也说明国民经济任何一个部门、任何一个工作人员都能够在支援农业中担负起适当的任务，为加速农业的发展贡献自己的力量。
    以农业为基础，更快地发展农业，对于全面发展国民经济和加快社会主义建设的重要意义，现在已经为越来越多的人所了解了。然而也还不能说所有的行业、部门和所有的人对这一点都认识得很深刻了。有些人虽然也知道支援农业重要，但又感到支援农业和本部门工作有矛盾，总觉得不大合算，因而对支援农业表现得还不是那么全心全意。支援农业和部门工作是有一些矛盾的。拿工业部门来说，为农业制造各种生产资料，一般产值比较低，而且季节性很强，特别是在开始安排生产的时候，总不免会遇到一些困难。又例如，有些机关在抽出大批干部支援农业以后，也可能会暂时影响一些部门的工作，等等。这些都是矛盾。
    但是人们用什么态度去对待矛盾，其结果并不是一样的。是只算一个部门、一个单位的账，回避工作中的矛盾，把支援农业当成额外负担，甚至抱着与己无关的态度呢？还是鼓足干劲，千方百计去解决矛盾，使自己部门的工作最大限度地适应以农业为基础的需要呢？采取前一种态度，对一个行业、一个部门来说是方便了，但这显然是不利于加快农业的发展的；事实上，如果农业不大发展，各行各业的工作又怎能持续跃进呢？采取后一种态度，工作上暂时可能出现一些矛盾，也会遇到一些困难，但只要积极采取具体措施，矛盾就能不断解决，工作就会出现新的跃进局面。晋城县各行各业全力支援农业以后，在很短的时间内不仅加速了全县农业技术改造的进程，在一定程度上改变了后进地区的农业生产面貌，而且也大大提高了广大干部思想水平，改进了作风，使各行各业的工作同时出现了持续跃进的新面貌，就是一个很有说服力的例证。
    坚定地树立起以农业为基础的思想，从人力、物力、技术各方面全心全意地给农业以更多、更大、更全面的支援，让农业以更快的速度向前发展，这是国民经济各行各业共同的迫切任务。
