Liaoning Province's agricultural scientific research departments, in conjunction with current agricultural production, are vigorously developing "research stations," making scientific work more oriented towards practical application and the masses. In the high tide of agricultural technological transformation across the province, these stations are playing an increasingly significant role.

In the first half of this year, the Liaoning Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the agricultural scientific research institutions of various cities dispatched one-third of their research personnel to establish sixty-five "research stations" in fifty-two cities and counties throughout the province. In these "research stations," Party committee cadres, scientific research personnel, and the masses of farmers are closely integrated. Taking large-area high-yield fields as a base, they have opened up hundreds of experimental fields and are implementing various new technical measures in accordance with the requirements of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," conducting specialized research and experimentation. Furthermore, they are using the results of their research to promote and guide production. This approach has not only enriched the content of scientific research work but has also powerfully promoted the development of agricultural production. To date, the sixty-five "research stations" distributed throughout the province have promoted sixty-five scientific research achievements. For example, researchers from the Lüda City Agricultural Science Institute, together with farmers from the state-owned Chengzi Commune, created a new experience of "one planting, multiple harvests" for celery, scallions, and cabbage, shortening the growing time of cabbage from the previous one hundred days to sixty days. Another example is the new technology of early sowing, which has been adopted by many "research stations," generally advancing sowing by ten days to half a month compared to previous years. According to statistics from more than 150 high-yield fields in thirteen cities and counties, the emergence rate generally reached over 95%, and the seedlings grew vigorously, opening up a path for changing old farming habits in Northeast China.

In addition to conducting their own scientific experiments, the stationed scientific research personnel also help local farmers to carry out mass-based experimental research. According to statistics from twenty-five brigades in eleven communes in eight counties, high-yield fields cultivated by researchers and farmers together, or those cultivated with their assistance and guidance, account for more than 30% of the area of grain crops.

The "research stations" distributed in the vast countryside have also trained a large number of agricultural technical personnel locally. According to incomplete statistics from January to May, the province's "research stations" have held a total of sixty-seven various professional training classes. The "research stations" in Tieling County alone have trained more than one thousand farmer technical backbones in agriculture, horticulture, agricultural machinery, and animal husbandry. Many researchers who are stationed in the countryside for long periods of time eat, live, and work with the farmers, and also teach part-time in Red and Expert Spare-time Schools and agricultural middle schools, organizing various scientific research groups and widely展開 engaging in activities to impart agricultural scientific knowledge.

Practice has proven that establishing research stations in the vast countryside is an effective way to promote comprehensive cooperation between scientific research departments and communes, accelerate agricultural technological transformation, and promote the great development of agriculture. Through this form, scientific research departments can closely integrate their research activities with production, and professional scientific researchers can closely integrate with the broad masses of commune members, allowing them to obtain a large number of important topics from production practice and better serve agricultural production. Because they have received substantial technical support, various communes will be able to vigorously promote the transformation of agricultural technology and promote a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries.

### 辽宁农村遍设科学研究基点  三分之一研究人员下乡推广农业新技术

    辽宁农村遍设科学研究基点
    三分之一研究人员下乡推广农业新技术
    本报讯　辽宁省农业科学研究部门，结合当前农业生产，大搞“研究基点”，使得科学工作更加面向实际、面向群众，在全省农业技术改造高潮中，日益显著地发挥出重大作用。
    今年上半年，中国农业科学院辽宁分院和各市农业科学研究机关，抽出三分之一的研究人员，到全省五十二个市、县建立了六十五个“研究基点”。在这些“研究基点”里，党委负责干部、科学研究人员、农民群众紧密结合，以大面积丰产方为基地，开辟成百块试验田，按照农业“八字宪法”的要求，推行各项新的技术措施，分别进行专业的研究试验，并且通过研究的成果，推动和指导生产。这种作法，不仅丰富了科学研究工作的内容，而且也有力地促进了农业生产的发展。到目前为止，分布在全省农村的六十五个“研究基点”，已经推广的科学研究成果，就有六十五项。如旅大市农业科学研究所的研究人员，国营城子公社农民一道创造出芹菜、大葱、甘兰“一种多收”的新经验，使甘兰的成长时间从过去的一百天缩短到六十天。再如提前播种的新技术，许多“研究基点”都采用了，一般地较往年提早十天到半月。据十三个市县一百五十多块丰产田统计，出苗率普遍达到95％以上，而且小苗生长茁壮，给东北地区改变耕作旧习惯打开了一条出路。
    驻点的科学研究人员，除了进行自己的科学试验以外，还帮助当地农民大搞群众性的试验研究。据八个县十一个公社二十五个大队的统计，研究人员和农民一道搞的丰产田，或在他们帮助和带动下搞起来的丰产田，占粮食作物面积的30％以上。
    分布在广大农村的“研究基点”，还就地培养了大批农业技术力量。据1月到5月的不完全统计，全省“研究基点”共开办各种专业训练班六十七项。仅铁岭县的“研究基点”，就培训了农业、园艺、农业机械、畜牧饲养等农民技术骨干一千多人。许多长期驻在农村的研究人员，和农民同吃同住同劳动，还在红专业余学校、农业中学兼课，组织各类科学研究小组，广泛展开传授农业科学知识的活动。
    实践证明，在广大农村建立研究基点，是促进科学研究部门和公社全面大协作，加速农业技术改造，推动农业大发展的有效形式。通过这种形式，科学研究部门把自己研究活动同生产紧密结合起来，专业科学研究人员同广大社员群众紧密结合起来，可以从生产实践中获得大量的重要的课题，更好地为农业生产服务；各个公社也因为得到了切实的技术支援，将有力地促进农业技术的改造和促进农、林、牧、副、渔全面大丰收。（附图片）
