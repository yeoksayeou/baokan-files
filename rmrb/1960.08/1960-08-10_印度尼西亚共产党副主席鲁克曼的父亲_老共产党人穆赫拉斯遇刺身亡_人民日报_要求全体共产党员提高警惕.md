Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 9th: According to the Indonesian "People's Daily," Muhlas, the father of Indonesian Communist Party Vice Chairman Lukman, a veteran and tested cadre of the Indonesian Communist Party, was assassinated at his residence in Tegal, Central Java, by a group of "Islamic Army" members. He was eighty years old.

On the evening of August 5th, Muhlas was resting in front of his residence. Suddenly, a group of "Islamic Army" members approached him and opened fire from a distance of five meters. Muhlas was immediately struck and fell to the ground, blood gushing from his head and chest, and he died instantly.

Chairman Aidit of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party sent a letter to Lukman on behalf of the Party Central Committee, expressing deep condolences for the assassination of Muhlas.

The Central Committee of the Indonesian Peasants' Front, on behalf of its 3.5 million members, expressed condolences for the death of Muhlas.

The "People's Daily" stated that the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people are extremely saddened by the murder of Muhlas. Muhlas's life of struggle sets an example for all members of the Indonesian Communist Party. His murder reminds all Indonesian Communist Party members to heighten their vigilance. The newspaper said that recently, reactionaries in Tegal, with the help of the "Islamic Army," have been carrying out activities in an attempt to isolate and attack the Indonesian Communist Party. Muhlas actively fought back. Precisely for this reason, and because he had a son, Lukman, who serves as the Vice Chairman of the Indonesian Communist Party, the "Islamic Army" took his life by the most brutal means.

    印度尼西亚共产党副主席鲁克曼的父亲
    老共产党人穆赫拉斯遇刺身亡
    “人民日报”要求全体共产党员提高警惕
    新华社雅加达9日电　据印度尼西亚“人民日报”报道，印度尼西亚共产党副主席鲁克曼的父亲、一位久经考验的印度尼西亚共产党干部穆赫拉斯，在中爪哇直葛的住所被一伙“伊斯兰教军”杀害。他今年八十岁。
    8月5日晚，穆赫拉斯正耽在住所的前面。突然一帮“伊斯兰教军”向他走来，并在离开五米的地方向他开枪。穆赫拉斯当场中弹倒下，血从他的头部和胸部涌出来，随即身亡。
    印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会主席艾地代表党中央写信给鲁克曼，对穆赫拉斯被杀害，表示深切的哀悼。
    印度尼西亚农民阵线中央委员会以三百五十万会员的名义，对穆赫拉斯遇难表示悼念。
      “人民日报”说，印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民对穆赫拉斯的被害感到极为痛心。穆赫拉斯一生的斗争为印度尼西亚共产党全体党员树立了榜样。他的被害提醒印度尼西亚全体共产党员要提高警惕。报纸说，最近，直葛的反动派在“伊斯兰教军”的帮助下进行活动，企图孤立和打击印度尼西亚共产党。穆赫拉斯积极地进行了反击。正因为这样，也正因为他有一个担任印度尼西亚共产党副主席的儿子鲁克曼，所以，“伊斯兰教军”用最残酷的手段夺去了他的生命。
