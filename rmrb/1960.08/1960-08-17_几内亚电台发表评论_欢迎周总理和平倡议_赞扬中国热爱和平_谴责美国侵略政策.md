Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, August 15th. Guinean radio broadcast a commentary on August 14th, welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's initiative to conclude a treaty of mutual non-aggression and peace between Asian and Pacific Rim countries, including the United States, and to make the region a nuclear-weapon-free zone. The radio station pointed out that the Chinese people love peace, and also condemned the US government for pursuing a policy of aggression.

The radio station said that China has also made significant progress and results in resolving the Sino-Burmese border issue. The radio station also mentioned the two contracts recently signed between China and Cuba in Havana regarding rice and sugar, saying that "people should pay close attention to the great significance of these contracts."

The commentary condemned the US government for actually supporting Belgium's blatant aggression against the Congo and defending it. The commentary said: It should be pointed out that in 1955, Belgium, as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, signed an agreement with the United States, according to which Belgium promised to provide the United States with large amounts of Congolese uranium and thorium ore. The Congo incident, the state of political chaos in the Congo, is mainly due to the indisputable fact that Western countries want to maintain control of the Shinkolobwe mines.

The commentary condemned the US U-2 spy plane for violating Soviet airspace, saying that people believe that the spy flight incident demonstrates the US government's aggressive policy.

The commentary talked about a series of measures taken by the Cuban government to nationalize American enterprises, saying that people must pay special attention to the development of the situation in Cuba. It said that the Cuban authorities, in a memorandum submitted to the Organization of American States, sternly condemned the United States for carrying out aggression and provocation against Cuba and for being responsible for the tensions in the Antilles.
