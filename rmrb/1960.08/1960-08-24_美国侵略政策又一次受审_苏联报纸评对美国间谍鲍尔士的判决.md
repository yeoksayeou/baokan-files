    American Aggression Policy on Trial Again
    Soviet Newspapers Comment on the Sentencing of American Spy Powers

    The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" stated in an editorial on August 21st regarding the Soviet Supreme Court's verdict on the American spy pilot Powers, that the Soviet court's verdict is the verdict of all Soviet people and peace-loving humanity on a dangerous criminal caught red-handed. It is also a verdict on the adventurous policies of the American ruling circles who attempt to treat espionage, provocations, and the undermining of other countries' sovereignty as norms of international relations. The editorial said that all Soviet people warmly support this just verdict. All peace-loving people unanimously support the court's decision. All who cherish the cause of peace understand that the extremely dangerous actions of the American aggressive bloc not only lead to a sharp intensification of the international situation, not only destroyed the Paris summit, but could also bring terrible catastrophe to mankind. Maintaining a state of brinkmanship, escalating international tensions, frantically engaging in an arms race, piecing together aggressive blocs, and carrying out criminal provocations against the cause of peace and the security of all nations - these are all the diplomatic means of Washington, which were particularly evident during the days of the Powers trial. The editorial then pointed out that when the Soviet court uncovered all the despicable crimes related to this case, American officials and prostituted newspapers desperately tried to claim that they had nothing to do with Powers. But the trial materials completely exposed the provocateurs in Washington.
    The editorial emphasized that the court's verdict is a solemn warning to those who dare to violate the inviolability of the Soviet border, dare to undermine peace and the security of all nations, and to the accomplices of the American aggressors.
    Although the trial of Powers has ended, another court is still in session, with many more in the dock, and the accusers are millions of people. This is a people's court trying the organizers of American provocative policies. The organizers of American provocative policies have so far been carrying the bandit banner of espionage and sabotage. They continue to create conspiracies against peace.
    The editorial concluded by saying that no matter how cunning the provocateurs are, they will not escape the punishment they deserve. Peace-loving people all over the world will make a solemn judgment: the enemies of peace - put them in the stocks for public display! The Soviet people have their ways to protect their great achievements. Any aggressor will be bloodied before the indestructible power of the Soviet Union.
    "Red Star" and "Labor Daily" published relevant editorials on the 20th respectively.
    "Red Star's" editorial said that the exposure of the American spy Powers is also an exposure of the American reactionary ruling clique. American leaders like to make hypocritical, feigned peace-loving remarks. They insist on saying that they are ready for peaceful cooperation and disarmament, but in fact, they are doing something completely different. The editorial pointed out that the trial of Powers once again revealed the true meaning of the so-called "peace-loving" American policy, and once again showed the thuggish, aggressive imperialist face of American policy.
    The editorial said that the Soviet people love peace and actively strive for peace, but they have not forgotten for a minute the thuggish policies of imperialism, especially American imperialism.
    "Labor Daily's" editorial said that the three-day trial convincingly showed the adventurous policies of the American ruling circles. Now it is clear to everyone that American leaders should bear full responsibility for Powers' crimes.

    美国侵略政策又一次受审
    苏联报纸评对美国间谍鲍尔士的判决
    新华社莫斯科21日电　苏联“真理报”在21日就苏联最高法院对美国间谍飞行员鲍尔士的判决发表的社论中指出，苏联法庭的判决——这就是全体苏联人民和爱好和平的全人类对当场被捕的危险的罪犯的判决。这也是对企图把间谍活动、挑衅和破坏别国主权当作国际关系准则的美国统治集团的冒险政策的判决。社论说，全体苏联人民都热烈拥护这一公正的判决。所有爱好和平的人类都一致支持法庭的决定。所有珍视和平事业的人都明白，美国侵略集团的十分危险的行动不仅导致国际局势的急剧尖锐化，不仅破坏了巴黎最高级会议，而且可能给人类带来可怕的浩劫。保持战争边缘状态、加剧国际紧张局势、疯狂地进行军备竞赛、拼凑侵略集团、对和平事业和各国人民的安全进行罪恶挑衅——这就是华盛顿的所有外交手段，在审讯鲍尔士的日子里，这些手段就特别明显地公诸于世。社论接着指出，当苏联法庭把同这一案件有关的卑鄙罪行一一查清的时候，美国官方人士和卖身投靠的报纸拼命想表白，他们同鲍尔士毫无瓜葛。但是审讯材料完全揭穿华盛顿的挑衅者。
    社论强调说，对于那些敢于破坏苏联边境的不可侵犯性、敢于破坏和平和各国人民安全的人以及对于美国侵略者的同谋犯来说，法庭的判决是一个庄严的警告。
    虽然对鲍尔士的审讯已经结束，但是，另外一个法庭仍在继续进行审讯，那里的被告席要多得多，控诉人是数以百万计的人民。这便是对美国挑衅政策的组织者进行审讯的全民法庭。美国挑衅政策的组织者迄今一直打着进行间谍活动和破坏活动的强盗旗号。他们继续制造反对和平的阴谋诡计。
    社论最后说，无论挑衅者如何狡猾，他们决逃脱不了应得的惩罚，全世界爱好和平的人们将作出严正的判决：和平的敌人——枷号示众！苏联人民有其保护自己伟大成果的办法。任何侵略者都将在苏联的不可摧毁的威力面前碰得头破血流。
    “红星报”和“劳动报”在20日分别发表了有关社论。
    “红星报”的社论说，对美国间谍鲍尔士的揭露也就是对美国反动统治集团的揭露。美国领导人喜欢发表伪善的假装爱好和平的言词。他们硬说什么自己准备进行和平合作和裁军，事实上，他们干的完全是另外一套。社论指出，对鲍尔士的审讯又一次揭露了美国政策所谓“爱好和平”的真正含义，又一次表明了美国政策的强盗的、侵略的帝国主义面目。
    社论说，苏联人民爱好和平，并积极争取和平，但他们一分钟也没有忘记帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义的强盗政策。
    “劳动报”的社论说，三天的审讯令人信服地看清了美国统治集团的冒险方针。现在任何人都清楚，美国领导人对鲍尔士的罪行应负完全责任。（附图片）
