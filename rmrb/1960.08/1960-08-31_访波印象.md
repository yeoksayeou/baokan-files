    Impressions of a Visit to Poland
    Pan Fei

    The azure Vistula River, like a ribbon, encircles Warsaw's waist. On the riverbank stands a bronze mermaid statue. People have woven many captivating legends about her. Although the eastern bank of the river is lined with continuous factories, and the western bank is filled with newly built high-rise buildings, this romantic statue, these affectionate ancient myths, combined with the young socialist capital of Poland, seem so natural and harmonious, simply indispensable.
    Warsaw is one of the most beautiful cities in Eastern Europe. Indeed, Poland itself is one of the most beautiful countries in Eastern Europe. During a month-long visit, I traveled to major cities in southern, western, and northern Poland. Now, when I close my eyes and meditate, each city seems like a dazzling pearl. They are linked together into an incomparably magnificent necklace, worn on the mermaid's chest.
    Anyone who has visited Krakow will have its image etched in their heart like it was carved with a knife, never to be erased. At the top of the bell tower of the ancient church in the city center, someone comes out to blow a trumpet every hour. It is said that in ancient times, a heroic trumpeter called upon the people to resist foreign invasions from here. I listened so earnestly and attentively: the trumpet sound stops abruptly halfway through. This signifies that the trumpeter was shot and wounded by an arrow in those years. This story is so complete and moving that it has been passed down to this day, making you unable to doubt it. Legends are, after all, legends; what makes me admire Krakow is that it was the center of the famous peasant movement in Polish history. Across from the church is the tower of the remaining old city hall, where the leaders of the peasant uprisings were imprisoned. On the walls around the city center, proclamations of the rebel army, written with "All men are brothers within the four seas," were posted in those years. When I strolled around the Jagiellonian University where Copernicus studied, when I saw the medieval open-air theater that is still in use today, this peaceful ancient city seemed to push time back to the era of five hundred years ago. However, when you arrive in Nowa Huta, another district under the jurisdiction of Krakow—ten kilometers from the city—people will inevitably have a feeling of astonishment produced by being tricked by a magician. Time suddenly leaps forward several centuries again. Nowa Huta is a large-scale iron and steel integrated enterprise. Ten years ago, this was still a desolate wilderness; now, the enterprise produces 1.5 million tons of steel annually. Accompanying the birth of the steel plant is a new socialist city with a population of 100,000. Not only is this city young, but its masters are also young: the average age of the residents is only twenty-three years old. This is how Krakow skillfully combines the Poland of Copernicus's time with the Poland of the socialist era into a seamless whole.
    Katowice, southwest of Warsaw, is one of Poland's major industrial cities. It is an important base for coal mining and metallurgy, and it is also the birthplace of the Polish "Socialist Labor Production Team" competition movement. In the suburbs of Katowice, mine hoists are erected everywhere, forming a unique landscape of the industrial area. In Katowice city, although you can't see the hoists, miners are operating combines hundreds of meters below the city. They extract coal and fill the tunnels with sand to prevent the city from collapsing. 80% of Poland's coal is produced by the miners of Katowice and its vicinity. Coal is the soil that nurtures Katowice's growth and development. It is a strange bud blooming in this black fertile land.
    Is it an exaggeration to compare such cities to pearls?
    When I returned to Warsaw after traveling all over Poland, Comrade Gietow, Vice-Chairman of the Polish State Planning Commission, briefed us on the implementation of the Five-Year Plan. This year is the last year of Poland's Five-Year Plan. The total value of state-owned industrial production in the first half of this year increased by 9.9% compared with the same period last year. The Five-Year Plan will be overfulfilled: the original plan stipulated an industrial production increase of 49% in five years, but it will actually increase by 56%. The greatest achievement of the Five-Year Plan is overcoming the backward state inherited by Poland from capitalist society. If in 1937, Poland had an average of only 43 kilograms of steel, 106 kWh of electricity, and 1,000 kilograms of coal per person (including all fuels converted), then by the end of 1959, the average per person was 211 kilograms of steel, 900 kWh of electricity, and 3,500 kilograms of coal. Machinery manufacturing and the chemical industry were originally the most backward in the old Poland, but now they have become the most developed and advanced industrial sectors.
    The new Five-Year Plan for 1961-1965 has not yet been finalized, but the Planning Commission has put forward preliminary targets. The draft stipulates that industrial output in 1965 will increase by 53.8% compared to 1960. The growth of several major industrial sectors is as follows:
            1960　 1965
    Steel 6.57 million tons 9.3 million tons
    Coal 103.5 million tons 113.6 million tons
    Electricity 29 billion kWh 45.5 billion kWh
    Cement 6.5 million tons 11.1 million tons
    When I heard these figures that had already been realized and the figures that were mobilizing the entire nation to strive for as future goals, I silently pondered: what do they mean?
    I thought of Nowa Huta. Anyone who has visited this modern steel enterprise that has sprung up from the ground cannot help but feel excited and proud. Nowa Huta's steel has turned into the hulls of ships in the Gdansk shipyard, and these ships have traveled all over the world's oceans. Nowa Huta's steel has turned into lathes or tractors in the machinery factories of Wroclaw and Poznan, arming Poland's industry and agriculture. By 1965, the output of this steel plant will more than double—3.3 million tons per year. The factory has refined steel and also refined people. With the development of production, a new generation of the Polish working class has been cultivated. 60% of Nowa Huta's workers used to be farmers. When farmers first came to the factory, they regarded industry as their second profession: they would ask for leave to go home during the busy farming season. Now, these people have completely changed. What they care about is how to complete and overfulfill the country's plan.
    I thought of the Polish countryside. Polish farmers call tractors "steel horses." Under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the farmers are driving steel horses along the road of cooperativization towards a happy future. In Poznan County, I visited a high-level cooperative, which was established by seventeen tenant farmers in 1952. The difficulties encountered at the beginning were unimaginable: lack of farm tools and livestock; the cooperative director being pelted with stones when walking through the village at night; rumors slandering cooperativization spread like wildfire. However, the members believed that the road they had chosen was correct, and the difficulties were temporary, so they named the cooperative "Bright Future." In the winter of 1956, an evil wind blew, and some people wanted to dissolve the cooperative. The backbone members insisted on continuing to run the cooperative and persuaded everyone, and only two households withdrew. The cooperative distributed the best farm tools and livestock to the households that withdrew. Having survived this most difficult period, the cooperative's production continued to develop, and life gradually became prosperous. Now it has two tractors. Under its influence, the households that withdrew, together with some farmers, established a primary cooperative and are preparing to merge with the "Bright Future" cooperative this autumn. The experience of the "Bright Future" cooperative is so simple and ordinary, just like the road taken by many other cooperatives, but it reflects such a profound social change. Poland currently has 2,142 cooperatives. After the cooperative shows the superiority of improving production, and after the farmers are convinced of its superiority, the development of rural cooperativization in Poland in the next five-year plan can be imagined.
    I also remember that when visiting Wroclaw, Poznan, and Gdansk, Polish comrades often pointed to a wilderness and said that in the next five-year plan, a new residential area for hundreds of thousands of people will appear here, or a new factory or a new thermal power station will appear. When you know that these cities were 60% to 70% destroyed during the war and are now not only restored but also built better, no one will regard this prediction as a fantasy. In the next five years, the Turów Power Plant, located on the border of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Germany, will be completed, generating 1.2 million kilowatts of electricity annually. More than fifty new coal mines will be built and expanded. A new aluminum plant will appear in Konin, and new zinc and lead plants will appear in Silesia. In the past five years, 1.2 million houses have been built across Poland, and 1.8 million houses will be built in the next five years. In the new town of Nowa Huta, when I visited a newly built residential building, I casually knocked on the door of a miner's family. The young host smiled silently, and the strong smell of paint from the new building made people feel a sense of happiness.
    Striving to overfulfill the Five-Year Plan and achieve the goals of the new Five-Year Plan, how strong a perseverance and how much labor must be paid! The Fifth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, which was held not long ago, put forward a new slogan: use less funds and ensure the same effect. Now, workers across Poland are striving to save 10 to 15 billion zlotys. Factories and mines that have increased production tasks are striving to increase production without increasing manpower. Designers and construction workers are striving to shorten construction time. The designs of 20,000 projects are being or will be reviewed.
    When the party's slogans become mass actions, what obstacles can stop the Polish working class from advancing? (Attached picture)

    访波印象
    潘非
    蔚蓝的维斯杜拉河，像条绵带一样围绕在华沙的腰际。河畔，竖立着一座青铜的美人鱼雕像。人们为她编了许多令人神往的传奇故事。虽然，河的东岸是连绵不断的工厂，河的西畔是一片片新盖起来的高楼大厦，但这座浪漫主义的雕像，这些情意缠绵的古老神话，同年青的社会主义波兰的首都结合在一起，显得那么自然，那么调和，简直是不可缺少的。
    华沙是东欧最美丽的城市之一。岂只华沙，整个波兰，未尝不是东欧最美丽的国家之一。在一个月的访问中，我走遍了波兰南部、西部和北部的重要城市。现在闭起眼睛瞑想一下，每一个城市都仿佛是一颗光耀夺目的珍珠。它们联结成一串无比绚丽的项圈，佩挂在美人鱼的胸前。
    凡是访问过克拉科夫这个城市的人，它的形象就会像用刀斧镌刻在你的心上一样，永远不会磨灭。市中心的古教堂的钟楼顶端，每隔一小时，就有个人出来吹号。据说，在久远的年代，英勇的号手在这儿号召人民抵御外族的侵略。我听得那么真切，那么入神：号声吹到一半时，突然停顿一下。这意味着当年的号手中箭负伤。这个故事是这样完整和动人，一直流传到现在而使你对它毋庸怀疑。传说毕竟是传说；使我对克拉科夫景仰的是，它是波兰历史上有名的农民运动的中心。教堂对面，是残留下来的旧市政厅的塔楼，在这里面，囚禁过农民起义的领袖。在市中心四周的墙壁上，当年张贴过写着“四海之内皆兄弟也”的起义军的文告。当我在哥白尼学习过的雅格龙大学周围漫步的时候，当我看到至今仍然在使用的中世纪的露天剧场的时候，这宁静的古城似乎把时光推回到五百年以前的时代。但是，当你到了克拉科夫市辖的另一个区——离城十公里的诺瓦胡塔时，人们不期而然会有一种被魔术师戏弄而产生的惊愕的感觉。时间一下子又飞跃过好几个世纪。诺瓦胡塔是个规模庞大的钢铁联合企业。十年前这里还是一片漠野；现在，这个企业年产一百五十万吨钢。伴随着钢铁厂的诞生，出现了一座拥有十万人的社会主义新城。不仅这个城市是年轻的，它的主人也是年轻的：居民的平均年龄只有二十三岁。克拉科夫就是这样巧妙地把哥白尼时代的波兰和社会主义时代的波兰，浑然一体地结合在一起。
    华沙西南的卡多维支，是波兰的主要工业城市之一。它是采煤和冶金的重要基地，也是波兰“社会主义劳动生产队”这一竞赛运动的策源地。卡多维支的郊区，到处竖立着煤井的绞车，构成了一幅工业区特有的景色。而在卡多维支市内，虽然看不见有绞车，但在城市下面几百米的深处，矿工们正开动着康拜因。他们掏出煤来，又把沙土填充着坑道，防止城市的下塌。波兰80％的煤，是卡多维支和它附近的矿工生产出来的。煤，就是哺育卡多维支生长、发展的土壤。它是这黑色的沃土里开放出来的一朵奇异的花苞。
    把这样一些城市比作珍珠，难道是夸张吗？
    当我在波兰各地旅行完了回到华沙的时候，波兰国家计划委员会副主席盖特同志向我们介绍了五年计划的执行情况。今年是波兰五年计划的最后一年。今年上半年的公营工业生产总值，比去年同期增长了9.9％。五年计划将被超额完成：原规定五年中工业生产增长49％，实际上将增加56％。五年计划的最大成就，是克服了波兰从资本主义社会继承下来的落后状态。如果在1937年的时候，波兰每人平均只有四十三公斤钢，一百零六瓩电，一千公斤煤
  （把所有的燃料折合在内），那末到1959年年底时，每人平均为二百一十一公斤钢，九百瓩电，三千五百公斤煤。机械制造和化学工业在旧波兰原本是最落后的，现在都已成为最发达最先进的工业部门了。
    1961—1965年的新五年计划还没有定案，但是计划委员会已提出初步指标。草案规定1965年的工业产量比1960年增加53.8％。几个主要工业部门的增长情况是：
            1960年　1965年
    钢　657万吨　930万吨
    煤　10，350万吨　11，360万吨
    电力　290亿度　455亿度
    水泥　650万吨　1，110万吨
    当我听到这些已经实现了的数字和作为未来的目标而动员全民奋斗的数字时，我默默地思索：它们意味着什么呢？
    我想起了诺瓦胡塔。凡是参观过这个平地兴起的现代化的钢铁企业的人，不能不感到激动和骄傲。诺瓦胡塔的钢材，在格旦斯克的造船厂里变成了船舶的躯壳，这些船舶走遍了世界的汪洋大海。诺瓦胡塔的钢材，在伏罗茨瓦夫和波兹南的机械厂里变成了车床或拖拉机，武装着波兰的工业和农业。到1965年时，这个钢铁厂的产量将增加一倍以上——年产三百三十万吨。工厂炼了钢，也炼了人。随着生产的发展，培养出了波兰工人阶级的新的一代。诺瓦胡塔60％的工人过去是农民。农民初来工厂的时候，把工业看作他们的第二个职业：一到农忙时节，他们就要请假回家。现在，这些人完全变了，他们关心的是怎样完成和超额完成国家的计划。
    我想起了波兰农村。波兰农民把拖拉机称为“钢马”。在波兰统一工人党的领导下，农民们沿着合作化的道路，驾着钢马奔向幸福的未来。在波兹南县我参观过一个高级合作社，它是由十七户雇农在1952年成立的。开始时遇到的困难是难以设想的：缺乏农具和牲口；合作社社长晚间在村子里走过时被人砸石头；污蔑合作化的谣言不胫而走。但是，社员们相信自己选择的道路是正确的，困难是暂时的，因此命名合作社为“光明前途”社。1956年冬，一阵歪风刮来，有些人要散伙。骨干分子坚持继续办社，说服了大家，只有两户退社。合作社把最好的农具和牲口分给了退社的农户。熬过了这一段最困难的时期，合作社的生产不断发展，生活也逐渐富裕起来，现在已经有了两架拖拉机。退社的农户在它的影响下，联合一些农民成立了一个初级社，并且准备今秋同“光明前途”社合并。“光明前途”社的经历是这样简单和平凡，正如其他许多合作社所走过的道路一样，但是它反映了多么深刻的社会变革。波兰现有二千一百四十二个合作社。在合作社显出提高生产的优越性，在农民信服它的优越性之后，下一个五年计划中波兰农村合作化的发展是可以想像得到的。
    我还想起，在访问伏罗茨瓦夫、波兹南和格旦斯克这些城市的时候，波兰同志常常指着一片荒野，说在下一个五年计划中，这里将出现十几万人的新住宅区，或者是出现一个新的工厂、新的热电站。当你知道这些城市在战时都被破坏了60％至70％而现在不仅恢复、并且建设得更加美好的时候，谁也不会把这种预言看作幻想。在未来的五年中，位于波、捷、德边境的图鲁夫发电厂将告建成，每年发电一百二十万瓩。将新建和扩建五十多个煤井。在可尼那将出现新的制铝厂，在西朗斯克将出现新的制锌厂和制铅厂。过去五年中波兰全国建筑了一百二十万间住宅，未来的五年中将修建一百八十万间住宅。在诺伏赫特这个新镇，我在参观一幢刚刚建成的居民大厦时，顺便扣开了一家矿工家庭的门。年轻的主人默默的微笑，新建筑物发出来的浓郁的油漆气味，使人感受到一种幸福感。
    争取五年计划的超额完成，实现新五年计划的目标，这该具有多么坚强的毅力和付出多么巨大的劳动！不久前召开的波兰统一工人党五中全会，提出新的口号：使用更少的资金，保证同样的效果。现在，波兰全国的工人，正在为节约一百至一百五十亿兹罗提而努力。增加了生产任务的厂矿，努力做到增产不增人。设计师和建筑工人争取缩短建筑时间。有二万项工程的设计，正在或即将进行审查。
    当党的口号变成了群众行动的时候，还有什么障碍可以阻挡波兰工人阶级的前进呢？（附图片）
