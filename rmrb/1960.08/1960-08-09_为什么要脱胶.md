    In plant fibers, apart from seed fibers (such as cotton) which are flocculent fibers that can be directly used for spinning and weaving, most other wild plant fibers cannot be directly used for spinning and weaving. This is because wild plant fibers are composed of many different substances. For example, cotton stalks, in addition to having spinnable fibers, also contain impurities such as lignin, tannins, proteins, starch, fats, waxes, and pectin. These impurities and gums stick together with the spinnable fibers, making it impossible to use them for spinning and weaving. It is necessary to remove or partially remove these impurities and gums, leaving behind flocculent fibers similar to cotton. The process of removing these impurities and gums is called degumming.
    Different wild plants contain different impurities and gums, and different degumming methods can be adopted according to local conditions, time, and materials.

    为什么要脱胶
    在植物纤维中，除了种子纤维（如棉花）是絮状纤维，可以直接用来纺纱织布外，其他野杂植物纤维大都不能直接用来纺纱织布。这是因为野杂植物纤维是由多种不同的物质组成的。如棉秆皮，除了有可供纺织的纤维外，还有木质素、单宁、蛋白质、淀粉、脂肪及蜡质等杂质和果胶等胶质。这些杂质胶质和可纺纤维粘在一起，就无法用来纺纱织布。必须把杂质胶质除掉或部分地除掉，剩下类似棉花那样的絮状纤维才行。除掉这些杂质和胶质的过程，就叫脱胶。
    不同的野杂植物，所含的杂质胶质也不同，可以因地、因时、因料采用不同的脱胶方法。
