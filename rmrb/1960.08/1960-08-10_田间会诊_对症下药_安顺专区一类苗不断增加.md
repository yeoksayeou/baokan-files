Field Consultation, Prescribing the Right Remedy
Anshun Prefecture Continuously Increases First-Class Seedlings

    (Our dispatch) Guizhou's Anshun Prefecture cadres go deep into the fields, using the form of field consultation to effectively strengthen field management, so that third-class seedlings of various major autumn crops in the district are continuously reduced, and first-class seedlings are continuously increasing.

    This year, the planting area of ​​major autumn crops in Anshun Prefecture has expanded compared with last year, but due to the unprecedented drought during the sowing period, crop growth is very uneven. A considerable part of the rice fields did not have enough base fertilizer applied when hastily plowed after the rain, and the plowing and harrowing were also very rough, so the seedlings did not grow well. Corn was also affected by the drought, and was planted four or five months back and forth. Some were replanted or supplemented five or six times, and in one field, the early ones were already budding, while the late ones were just emerging, showing a phenomenon of "several generations in the same field." Other crops such as sweet potatoes, flue-cured tobacco, soybeans, and sugarcane also have similar situations. In this case, if field management is carried out according to routine methods such as hoeing, topdressing, and irrigation, it will no longer be able to adapt to the actual needs of growth.

    Faced with this complex field management task, after going deep into the front line, the broad masses of cadres adopted the "consultation" method to analyze and study the growth of seedlings, find out the weak links, and propose specific treatment methods. In recent months, more than 8,000 party organization secretaries at all levels in the region have participated in field consultations. Together with hundreds of thousands of commune members, they engaged in production while conducting three kinds of sorting of crops: first, sort by planting time and formulate specific management plans in batches and phases; second, sort by seedling growth and take different management measures; third, sort by planting conditions, so that food crops and coarse grains, main planting and increased planting, large areas and scattered crops, were all taken into account and comprehensively arranged.

    In field consultations, with more people and more discussions, the actual situation and development laws of crop growth can be figured out on the spot. After the end of mid-season rice transplanting, Liuzhi City launched more than 20,000 commune members and cadres in conjunction with field management activities to watch, inspect, and discuss while engaging in production. They found that seedlings in some remote fields, barren land, and fields planted late were not growing well. The county immediately launched a field management campaign centered on topdressing to vigorously eliminate third-class seedlings. Not long after armyworms harmed the corn in Puding County, the pest damage once eased, and some commune members thought that the pest had been completely eliminated. Through consultations between cadres, commune members, and technical cadres, it was found that the armyworms had entered the soil to pupate. If they were not dug out or poisoned, the damage would be even worse once they emerged as moths. Therefore, commune members were immediately organized to dig out and poison them.

    Through field consultation, the right medicine is truly prescribed. At present, the proportion of first-class rice seedlings in the entire region has increased from 50% to 70%, and the proportion of third-class seedlings has decreased from 20% to 8%.

### 田间会诊　对症下药  安顺专区一类苗不断增加

    田间会诊　对症下药
    安顺专区一类苗不断增加
    本报讯　贵州安顺专区干部深入田间，运用田间会诊形式，有效的加强田间管理，使全区各种大秋作物的三类苗不断减少，一类苗不断增加。
    今年安顺专区大秋作物播种面积比去年扩大，但由于在播种期遭受空前未有的大旱，作物生长很不平衡，还有相当一部分稻田由于在雨后抢犁没有来得及施放底肥，犁耙得也很粗糙，禾苗长得不壮。玉米也因为干旱，前后种了四、五个月，有的改种、补种五、六次，一块地内，早的已背包，晚的才出土，出现“几代同堂”的现象。其它如红苕、烤烟、大豆、甘蔗等作物，也有类似情况。在这种情况下，田间管理如果按常规采取几薅几追、几肥几水，已经不能适应生长的实际需要。
    面临这种复杂的田间管理任务，广大干部在深入第一线后，采取了“会诊”办法，对禾苗生长情况进行分析研究，找出薄弱环节，提出具体治疗办法。近月来，全区参加田间会诊的各级党组织书记就有八千多人。他们和几十万社员一道，一边搞生产，一边对作物进行三排队：一排种植时间，制订分批分期的具体管理计划；二排禾苗生长情况，采取不同管理措施；三排种植情况，对主粮和杂粮，正种与增种，成片的或零星的作物，都作到统筹兼顾，全面安排。
    在田间会诊中，人多议论多，对作物生长的实际情况和发展规律当场就能摸清。六枝市在中稻栽秧结束后，结合田间管理活动发动两万多社员和干部，边生产边看边查边议，发现部分远田、瘦地和种得晚的田地禾苗长得不好。全县立即掀起以追肥为中心的田间管理运动，大力消灭三类苗。普定县发生粘虫为害玉米后不久，虫害一度缓和，有些社员便以为虫害消灭光了，通过干部同社员、技术干部的会诊，发现原来粘虫已入土化蛹，如不挖除或毒杀，一旦成蛾出土，为害更烈，于是立即组织社员挖除毒杀。
    通过田间会诊，真正做到对症下药。目前全专区的水稻一类苗已由50％上升到70％，三类苗由20％降到8％。
