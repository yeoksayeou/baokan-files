Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd dispatch from Salisbury: Five to six hundred Africans held a demonstration on August 22nd in Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia, to protest the British colonial authorities' trial of Maweema, chairman of the Southern Rhodesia National Democratic Party.

Groups of African demonstrators shouted slogans and sang songs outside the Salisbury court. At the time, Maweema, chairman of the National Democratic Party, was being tried in this court.

It is reported that the British colonial authorities dispatched police to suppress the demonstrators and arrested at least three Africans.

The British colonial authorities arrested Maweema on July 19th on the pretext of violating the "Unlawful Organizations Act," and subsequently arrested a large number of members of the National Democratic Party, which advocates the elimination of colonialism. To protest this atrocity by the British colonial authorities, Africans in Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia, and Bulawayo, the industrial and commercial center, continuously held demonstrations and strikes last month.

Xinhua News Agency, Tazi, August 22nd dispatch: Aden news: The Aden Trades Union Congress reiterated on August 18th its opposition to the British colonial authorities' forceful passage of a decree depriving Aden workers of the right to strike, and pointed out that the struggle against colonial policy is still continuing. According to Aden Radio, the "Legislative Council" controlled by the British authorities in Aden passed this decree on August 15th, which was promulgated on August 1st.

According to the Aden newspaper "Awakening News," the British authorities in Aden also fired one hundred and fifty workers because they participated in the three-day general strike that began on August 15th to oppose the aforementioned decree.

It is reported that even some members of the "Legislative Council" expressed dissatisfaction with the decree when it was discussed on August 15th. Member of Parliament Ali Alewan said, "It is unreasonable to approve a decree that the people do not agree with."

Aden Radio also reported that the British authorities in Aden banned the weekly "Workers' Newspaper," published by the Aden Trades Union Congress.

In its most recent article, this weekly condemned "the British administrative authorities who have colonized Aden" for attempting to destroy the Aden working class. The weekly also pointed out that the British colonial authorities are attempting to incite pro-British political groups to establish an "Aden Autonomous Government" to maintain British colonial rule and use the decree depriving Aden workers of the right to strike as one of the means to oppress the people of Aden.

    抗议英国殖民当局迫害反殖民主义力量
    南罗得西亚非洲人示威
    亚丁工人决心继续同英国殖民者作斗争
    新华社23日讯　索耳兹伯里消息：五、六百名非洲人22日在南罗得西亚首府索耳兹伯里举行示威，抗议英国殖民当局审讯南罗得西亚民族民主党主席玛韦马。
    成群的非洲示威者在索耳兹伯里法院外面喊口号和唱歌。当时，民族民主党主席玛韦马正在这个法院受审。
    据报道，英国殖民当局曾经派遣警察前往镇压示威者，并且至少逮捕了三个非洲人。
    英国殖民当局是在7月19日以违反“非法组织法案”为借口逮捕玛韦马的，随后还大批逮捕了这个主张消灭殖民主义的民族民主党的党员。为了抗议英国殖民当局的这种暴行，南罗得西亚首府索耳兹伯里和工商业中心城市布拉瓦约的非洲人上个月曾不断举行示威和罢工。
    新华社塔兹22日电　亚丁消息：亚丁工会大会8月18日再次表示反对英国殖民当局强行通过剥夺亚丁工人罢工权利的法令，并指出，同殖民政策进行的斗争仍然在继续中。据亚丁电台广播，亚丁英国当局控制的“立法议会”于8月15日通过了这项在8月1日颁布的法令。
    据亚丁报纸“觉醒报”报道，亚丁英国当局还解雇了一百五十名工人，因为他们参加了为反对上述法令而在8月15日起举行的三天总罢工。
    据报道，在8月15日“立法议会”讨论上述法令时，甚至有些议员也对这个法令表示不满。议员阿里·阿勒万说，“批准人民所不同意的法令是不合理的”。
    亚丁电台还报道，亚丁英国当局取缔了亚丁工会大会出版的“工人报”周刊。
    这家周刊在它最近一期的文章中曾谴责“使亚丁殖民地化的英国行政当局”企图使亚丁工人阶级毁灭。这家周刊还指出：英国殖民当局企图煽动亲英的政治集团成立一个“亚丁自治政府”，来维护英国的殖民统治，并且以颁布剥夺亚丁工人罢工权利的法令来作为压迫亚丁人民的手段之一。
