In our undertaking, there are difficult conditions, but even more favorable conditions. To advance our cause, we must overcome difficulties and turn disadvantages into advantages.

This year, we have planted more late autumn crops, which increases the task of late-stage autumn field management.  -- At the same time, the expansion of the planting area is the best condition for increasing the total yield.

Between summer and autumn, many areas have more rain and more weeds, making autumn field management more laborious. -- At the same time, abundant rain is a good condition for storing water and preventing drought, and abundant weeds are a good condition for green manure composting.

Multiple expansions of planting, replanting, changing planting, and intercropping lead to inconsistent crop growth; some of the expanded planting areas are scattered and the terrain is complex. These add "trouble" to autumn field management. -- At the same time, the different growth periods and terrain are good conditions for flexibly allocating and using labor.

Seeing the difficult side, while also seeing the favorable side, allows us to find ways to conquer difficulties. The key lies in being good at "seeing" and being good at "applying."

Wusheng County in Sichuan Province, known for fully utilizing land to achieve "green mountains everywhere," has expanded the types of crops it plants, with dozens of varieties in one place; the sowing period of the same crop also varies, and the growth period and maturity period naturally differ. Early corn has already hung red tassels, while late corn has just straightened up. How to manage these crops well? Leading cadres at all levels of the Party committee and commune members went up the mountains and down to the fields together, discussing while observing. They ranked the growth status of various crops planted at different times and the time when management needed to be strengthened and the measures that needed to be added. They also made specific understandings of the conditions of large and scattered plots and investigated the current labor allocation of each production unit. Then, they combined the three aspects, matched them, and formulated a plan for batch-by-batch and phased comprehensive management of autumn fields. In this way, the role of full and semi labor forces can be brought into fuller play, crops in large fields and scattered lands can be managed by someone, and the phenomenon of large differences in labor intensity at different times and uneven busyness among different production units can be greatly improved. This is a good example of being good at seeing favorable conditions from difficulties and being good at using them to overcome difficulties.

This year, the cultivated area of ​​Guojiatian Commune in Lishu County, Jilin Province, has increased by more than 4,000 hectares compared with last year. Crops are planted on hills and depressions, and the amount of labor required for weeding is 30% more than last year; it happened to rain a lot after the summer weeding season began. The commune Party committee did not ignore the difficulties, nor was it afraid of the difficulties. On the one hand, they strengthened political work to educate cadres and commune members to establish the confidence and determination that man can conquer nature; on the other hand, they conducted in-depth investigations and studies, summarized the experience of a production team, and found practical and feasible methods to overcome the difficulties. The method is to uniformly plan and classify the land according to the soil quality and terrain of each team in the commune, and form eight cooperative networks according to the amount of depressions, hills, sandbags, and paddy fields in each team and the distance. Under the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, the power of large-scale cooperation is used: clear the depressions on sunny days, clear the hills in light rain, clear the sandbags in medium rain, manage the paddy fields in heavy rain, and clear the river bend land after the rain, so that no time is missed. This not only accelerated the progress of field management, but also improved the ideological awareness of the commune members. This is another good example of conquering difficulties by combining revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific analysis.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "As the ancients said, 'The wonder of application lies in one's heart.' We call this 'wonder' flexibility, which is the product of a clever commander. ... Flexibility is the ability of a clever commander to adopt timely and appropriate methods of handling situations based on objective conditions and 'judging the hour and sizing up the situation' (this situation includes the enemy's situation, our situation, the terrain, etc.), which is the so-called 'wonder of application'. Based on this 'wonder of application' ... we can realize our initiative over the enemy, overwhelm the enemy and defeat him, and final victory will belong to us." He also pointed out: "Here there are three key points: timing, location, and troops. If the timing is not right, the location is not right, or the situation of the troops is not right, victory cannot be achieved." ("On Protracted War") The comrades in Wusheng County and the comrades in Guojiatian Commune in Lishu County grasped these three key points of timing, terrain, and labor organization, mastered the "wonder of application" by "judging the hour and sizing up the situation," and flexibly utilized the labor force to seize the initiative in strengthening autumn field management and striving for an autumn harvest in relatively complex and difficult circumstances.

    运用之妙
    杨岭
    在我们的事业中，有困难条件，更有有利条件。要推动事业前进，就要克服困难，变不利为有利。
    今年的晚秋作物种得多，秋田后期管理的任务也就加重了。——同时，种植面积的扩大，正是增加总产量的最好的条件。
    夏秋间许多地区雨多、草多，秋田管理就更要多费劲。——同时，雨多正是蓄水防旱的好条件，草多正是沤青积肥的好条件。
    多次扩种、补种、改种、套种，作物的成长情况不一致；扩种的一些土地比较零星、地形比较复杂。这些，都给秋田管理添了“麻烦”。——同时，成长期的不同和地形的不同，又是比较灵活地调配使用劳动力的好条件。
    看到困难的一面，同时也要看到有利的一面，这样，就能从困难中找出办法来征服困难。关键就在于善于“看”，善于“运用”。
    以充分利用土地做到“满山青”著称的四川武胜县，扩种的作物种类很多，一个地方就有几十样；同一样庄稼的播种期也不同，生长期、成熟期自然也就不同。玉米早的已经挂起红缨，晚的刚刚挺起身来。怎样把这些庄稼都管好呢？各级党委领导干部和社员一起上山下田，边看边议，把不同时期种植的各种作物的生长情况和各自需要加强管理的时间、需要添加的措施排了队，并且对成片和零星的情况作了具体的了解，对各生产单位当前劳动力配置的情况也作了调查。然后，把三方面的情况结合起来，加以搭配，订出了分批分期全面管理秋田的方案。这样一来，全劳动力、半劳动力的作用就都能更充分地发挥，大块田和零星地的作物就都有人负责管理，不同时期劳逸差别很大、不同生产单位忙闲不均的现象也可以大为改观。这是善于从困难中看出有利条件并且善于运用它来战胜困难的一个好例子。
    吉林梨树县郭家店公社今年耕地面积比去年增加了四千多公顷，岗地、洼地上都多种了庄稼，锄地用工量要比去年多30％；夏锄季节开始后偏偏又碰到雨多。公社党委没有忽视困难，也没有害怕困难。他们一方面加强政治工作，教育干部和社员树立起人定胜天的信心和决心；一方面深入地调查研究，总结了一个生产队的经验，找到了克服困难的切实可行的办法。办法就是：根据全社各队的土地的土质、地势，统一规划，分类排队，按照各队洼地、岗地、沙包地、水田的多少和距离的远近，组成八个协作网，在互助互利的原则下，运用大协作的力量，晴天铲洼地，小雨铲岗地，中雨铲沙包地，大雨管理水田，雨后铲河套地，做到了风雨不误。这样，不但加快了田间管理的进度，而且提高了社员们的思想觉悟。这是把革命热情和科学分析结合起来征服了困难的又一个很好的例子。
    毛泽东同志说：“古人所谓‘运用之妙，存乎一心’，这个‘妙’，我们叫做灵活性，这是聪明的指挥员的出产品。……灵活，是聪明的指挥员，基于客观情况，‘审时度势’（这个势，包括敌势、我势、地势等项）而采取及时的和恰当的处置方法的一种才能，即是所谓‘运用之妙’。基于这种运用之妙，……就能实现我对于敌的主动权，就能压倒敌人而击破之，而最后胜利就属于我们了。”还指出：“这里有时机、地点、部队三个关节。不得其时，不得其地，不得于部队之情况，都将不能取胜。”（《论持久战》）武胜县的同志们和梨树县郭家店公社的同志们，正是抓住了天时、地势、劳动组织这三个关节，“审时度势”掌握了“运用之妙”，灵活地运用劳动力，在比较复杂比较困难的情况下掌握了加强秋田管理、争取秋季丰收的主动权。
