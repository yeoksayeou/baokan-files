    A Bold Heart and Lofty Ambitions Can Build a Fortune from Scratch
    No workshop? Build it ourselves! No equipment? Make it ourselves!
    No technology? Learn it ourselves! We won't rest until we produce mineral acid!
     ——Workers of the Fangshan County Fertilizer Plant, Hebei
                      * * * 
    Don't underestimate a small factory with poor conditions. As long as you have a bold heart and lofty ambitions, you can build a fortune from scratch. Crude methods can also achieve mechanization.
            ——Workers of the Changjiang Fiber Textile Factory, Sichuan
                      * * * 
    Where does ingenuity come from? It comes from the collective. Where does treasure come from? It must be sought from the masses. As long as we rely on the Party and mobilize the masses, for every thousand difficulties that arise, we can find thousands or tens of thousands of ways to overcome them.
                 ——Workers of Chongqing Light Industry
                          *　*　* 
    Advanced and backward are two opposing aspects of the contradiction of things, and they are objectively existent. If we do not admit backwardness and dislike backwardness, we cannot consciously resolve the contradiction between the advanced and the backward, and we cannot promote the movement and change of things. Since advanced and backward are objectively existent, we cannot adopt an attitude of evasion and compromise. We should face both the advanced and backward aspects, regard the struggle of opposing aspects as a normal phenomenon, and boldly unfold the struggle of opposing aspects, so as to resolve contradictions and promote the development of things.
  Wu Lianghu, Worker Engineer, Wuhan Jiang'an Vehicle Factory
                      
                            * * * 
    We workers like change and revolution the most. To change, who should we rely on? Reach out to the Party? Wait for others to change? These are not the words of us, the working class who are masters of our own house. We must rely on our own wisdom and hands to change. Where is paradise? In our palms. If the palms are constantly sweating, paradise will appear.
        ——Young Workers of Wuhan Jiang'an Bean Product Food Factory

    心雄志气大  白手能兴家
    没有车间自己建，没有设备自己干，
    没有技术自己练，不制出矿酸心不甘。
     ——河北房山县化肥厂工人
                      * * * 
    莫看厂小条件差，只要心雄志气大，白手也能兴起家，穷办法同样可以实现机械化。
            ——四川长江纤维纺织工人
                      * * * 
    巧从哪里来？巧从集体中来。宝从哪里来？宝要到群众中去找。只要依靠党、发动群众，出现一千条困难，就能够找出几千条、几万条克服困难的办法。
                 ——重庆轻工业工人
                          *　*　* 
    先进和落后是事物矛盾的两个对立面，是客观存在。不承认落后，讨厌落后，这样就不能自觉地解决先进与落后的矛盾，也就不能推动事物的运动与变化。既然先进与落后是客观存在，我们就不能采取回避和调和的态度，就应该正视先进和落后的两个方面，把对立面的斗争看作是正常的现象，放手展开对立面的斗争，这样才能解决矛盾，促进事物的发展。

                      吴良湖
                            * * * 
    要变，要革命，我们工人是最喜欢的。要变，靠谁来变？伸手向党要？等着别人变？这不是我们当家作主的工人阶级说的话。我们要靠我们自己的智慧和双手来变。哪里是天堂？在咱掌心上；掌心汗不断，天堂就出现。
        ——武汉江岸豆制
          食品厂青年工人
