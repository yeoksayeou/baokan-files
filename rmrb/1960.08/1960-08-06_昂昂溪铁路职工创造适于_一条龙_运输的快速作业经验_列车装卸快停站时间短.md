Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 5th - Railway workers in the Angangxi area of ​​the Qiqihar Railway Bureau, Heilongjiang Province, have created a fast operation experience suitable for "one-dragon" transportation. Before adopting the fast operation experience, the average time for a train to enter and leave Angangxi Station was 53 minutes. After adopting the fast operation method in March, it has now been reduced to 31 minutes. The turnaround time of freight cars has been reduced from 4.1 hours to 2.5 hours, and the loading and unloading time of freight cars has also been reduced from 7.6 hours to 5.7 hours. The pass rate of train technical inspections has increased from 87% to 90.6%. From March to June, this station saved a total of 269,355 car-hours, which is equivalent to adding 11,223 operating cars.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to this experience. The Provincial Party Committee's Communications Department has held an on-site meeting of railway transportation departments throughout the province in Angangxi, introducing this experience. Currently, this experience has been promoted in 33 areas throughout the province.

The advanced experience of fast transportation operations in the Angangxi area was generated on the basis of the widespread implementation of the "one-dragon" transportation experience. At the beginning of this year, in order to ensure the smooth flow of "dragon cars," railway workers in the Angangxi area went to the front line to work together on crash projects when "dragon cars" arrived at the station. However, due to the lack of a set of organizational work adapted to "dragon cars," and with the gradual networking of "one-dragon" transportation and the increasing number of "dragon cars," it was difficult to complete the task by relying solely on this method. The railway area party committee led the workers in summarizing the various advanced experiences created in the production campaign and the "protect the dragon car" activities, combining them into a set of fast operation experiences.

The main contents of the advanced experience of fast transportation operations in the Angangxi area are: After the train arrives at the station, the entire operation process, from vehicle technical inspection, repair of faults, freight bill handover, car shunting and coupling, locomotive entering and leaving the depot, coal and water supply, and handling of blocking procedures until the train departs, is composed of a compact, fast, high-quality, and efficient continuous operation line. Its specific methods are: (1) The employees of the station, locomotive depot, train inspection station, and train section further promote the spirit of communist collaboration on the basis of the original general collaboration, breaking through the boundaries between units and types of work, helping and supporting each other, making the various operation processes more closely and reasonably connected. For example, it was originally stipulated that after the train enters the station, the locomotive crew members should get off the train to remove the air hose and lift the hook. Now, the train inspectors do the work of the crew members while inspecting and repairing the vehicles, reducing the time for the crew members to get on and off the locomotive, lift the hook, and remove the air hose. (2) Try to adopt parallel operations as much as possible. By reforming equipment and adjusting labor organization, the six processes of locomotive sanding, ash removal, coal loading, water supply, oiling, and handover are carried out in parallel. As a result, the locomotive's stay in the depot has been reduced from 40 minutes to 24 minutes. (3) Establish a system for car attendants and locomotive crew members to report the status of vehicles and locomotives before the train arrives at the station. According to the forecast, the locomotive depot and vehicle depot carry out locomotive and vehicle inspection and preparation work, and the station prepares for the pre-arranged supplementary coupling of vehicles. (4) In order to achieve high quality and high efficiency, the train inspection station organizes forces to carry out rapid repairs for trains with short stop times; for vehicles that must be shunted off, methods such as shunting first and repairing later are adopted to ensure that the train departs smoothly in a very short time and ensure the safety and punctuality of the train. (5) Reduce repetitive and unnecessary operation procedures. In terms of transportation organization, a regional general dispatching agency is established to implement centralized and unified command.

### 昂昂溪铁路职工创造适于“一条龙”运输的快速作业经验  列车装卸快停站时间短

    昂昂溪铁路职工创造适于“一条龙”运输的快速作业经验
    列车装卸快停站时间短
    新华社哈尔滨5日电　黑龙江省齐齐哈尔铁路局昂昂溪地区铁路职工，创造了适于一条龙运输的运输快速作业经验。昂昂溪车站，在采用运输快速作业经验前，列车从进站到开出，平均为五十三分钟，3月采用快速作业的方法后，现已压缩到三十一分钟；货车中转时间由四点一小时减少到了二点五小时，货车装卸作业时间也由七点六小时减少为五点七小时；列车技术检查的合格率，由87％上升到90.6％。3月至6月，这个车站共节约二十六万九千三百五十五个车小时，等于增加一万一千二百二十三辆运用车。
    中共黑龙江省委十分重视这项经验。省委交通工作部已在昂昂溪召开了全省铁路运输部门现场会议，介绍了这项经验。目前，这个经验已在全省三十三个地区推广。
    昂昂溪地区运输快速作业的先进经验，是在普遍推行“一条龙”运输经验的基础上产生的。今年年初，昂昂溪地区的铁路职工，为了使“龙车”畅通无阻，“龙车”到站时，职工们都到第一线一起突击。但是，由于缺乏适应“龙车”的一套组织工作，而“一条龙”运输又逐步成网，“龙车”越来越多，因此单靠这种方法就很难完成任务。铁路地区党委领导职工们总结了生产运动会和保“龙车”活动中所创造的各项先进经验，搭配成套，形成了一套快速作业的经验。
    昂昂溪地区运输快速作业先进经验的主要内容是：列车到达车站以后，把车辆技术检查、修理故障、货票交接、甩车挂车、机车出入库、上煤上水、办理闭塞手续一直到列车出发，整个作业过程，组成一条紧凑、快速、高质、高效的连续作业线。它的具体作法是：（1）车站、机务段、列车检查所和列车段等部门的职工在原来一般协作的基础上，进一步发扬共产主义协作精神，冲破了单位、工种之间的界限，互相帮助，互相支援，使各种作业过程衔接得更紧密、更合理。比如原来规定列车进站后，由机车乘务员下车摘风管，提钩。现在，列车检车员在检修车辆的同时，就顺便把乘务员的活干了，减少了乘务员上下机车、提钩和摘风管的时间。（2）尽量采用平行作业。通过改革设备和调整劳动组织，将机车的上砂、清灰、上煤、上水、给油、交接等六个工序，实行平行作业。这样作的结果，机车在车库停留时间由过去的四十分钟，压缩到了二十四分钟。（3）建立车长、机车乘务员在列车到站前预报车辆状态和机车状态的制度。根据预报情况，机务段和车辆段进行机车、车辆检修准备工作，车站进行事先编好补挂的车辆等准备工作。（4）为达到高质量、高效率的要求，列车检查所对停站时间短的列车，就组织力量进行快速检修；必须甩下来的车辆，采取先甩后修等方法，使列车在很短时间内顺利开出，保证列车安全正点。（5）减少重复和不必要的作业手续。在运输组织方面，设立地区总调度机构，实行集中统一指挥。
