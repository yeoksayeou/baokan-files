    Five Thousand Militia Cross the Yellow River
    One Sunday in July, five thousand Jinan militia members conducted a swimming activity to cross the Yellow River.
    That day, the wind at Luokou Port on the Yellow River was force four, and the rain was getting heavier. The two-hundred-meter-wide river surface had turbulent currents. At 1:30 p.m., at the sound of the commanding officer's silver whistle, more than thirty young athletes from the Jinan Sports School jumped into the Yellow River like arrows released from a bow. They bravely fought against the ceaseless waves, appearing and disappearing in the swift whirlpools. When they had gone through arduous struggle and safely swam to the opposite bank, the people on the shore sent wave after wave of applause. Following them, more than a thousand militia members from Shandong Medical College, Jinan No. 1 Middle School, and various factories and organizations successfully swam to the opposite bank. The rest of the militia members, with assistance, also swam to the other side.

    五千民兵横渡黄河
    7月的一个星期日，济南五千民兵开展了横渡黄河的游泳活动。
    这天，黄河洛口港刮着四级大风，阵雨越下越大，二百米宽的河面水流滚滚。下午一点三十分，指挥员银笛一鸣，济南体育学校的三十余名年轻运动员像离弦之箭，首先跳入黄河，他们英勇地与不断袭来的波涛搏斗着，在水流湍急的漩涡中时隐时现。当他们经过一番艰苦奋战，安全地游到对岸时，岸上的人们传去了一阵又一阵的掌声。接着，山东医学院、济南第一中学以及各工厂、机关等单位的一千多名民兵，都胜利地游到了对岸。其余的民兵在协助下，也游到了对岸。
