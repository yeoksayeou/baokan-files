	The shoe-sewing machine emits a steady hum. Wang Guilan skillfully operates the machine, and in just over a minute, a pair of cloth shoes is sewn, not only quickly but also with good quality. Wang Guilan's highest daily output of sewn shoes reaches 265 pairs, setting a national record for shoe-sewing. But who would have thought that this female worker with the highest national shoe-sewing output was, two years ago, just an ordinary housewife and a mother of five children!
	In July, the Tianjin Dongfeng Shoe Factory launched a mass movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass advanced indicators and strive for the top. The factory's targets for learning and catching up were the Xingtai Shoe Factory, which held the national record with each worker producing 180 pairs of cloth shoes per day. For a time, slogans such as "Catch up with Xingtai" and "Surpass Xingtai" were plastered all over the factory, creating a truly fervent atmosphere. Wang Guilan thought: "We are all the same people. If they can reach 180 pairs, why can't I?" She set her own plan for learning from, catching up with, and surpassing, aiming to reach a daily output of 250 pairs and strive for the top. She first apprenticed to Cui Guanghua, a master craftsman with nearly 30 years of shoe-sewing experience, carefully observing and learning every small movement in Cui Guanghua's operation. After five days of hard work, she created a complete set of advanced operating methods for machine shoe-sewing, including accurate shoe placement, precise needle dropping, fast needle running, and skillful turning. This enabled her daily output to rapidly increase from 150 pairs to 265 pairs, with all products meeting quality standards, finally surpassing the national record output of the Xingtai Shoe Factory.

    上游无止境
    绱鞋机发出匀称的响声，王桂兰熟练地操纵着机器，才过了一分钟多一点，一双布鞋就绱好了，不但快，而且质量好。王桂兰一天绱鞋的最高产量达到二百六十五双，创造了绱鞋的全国最高纪录。可是，谁又会想到：这个全国绱鞋产量第一的女工，在两年前还是个普通的家庭妇女、有五个孩子的妈妈！
    7月份，天津东风制鞋厂开展了学赶超创先进指标、力争第一的群众运动，全厂学赶超的对象是全国最高纪录、每个工人日产一百八十双布鞋的邢台鞋厂。一时，“赶邢台”、“超邢台”的标语贴满了全厂，真是热火朝天。王桂兰想：“都是一样的人，人家能达到一百八十双，我为什么不能？”她订了自己的学赶超创规划，要达到日产二百五十双，力争第一。她先拜了有近三十年绱鞋经验的老师傅崔广华为师，细心地观察和学习崔广华操作中的每一个细小的动作。经过五天的刻苦钻研，她创造出放鞋正、落针准、跑针快、拐弯巧等一整套机器绱鞋的先进操作法，使日产量由一百五十双迅速提高到二百六十五双，质量全部合格，终于超过邢台鞋厂的全国最高产量。（跃）（附图片）
