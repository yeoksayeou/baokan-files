　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 25th: The Lao Fighting Forces Radio Station published a commentary on August 23rd, severely condemning U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in Southeast Asia for their interference in Laos.

　　The commentary pointed out, "The purpose of U.S. imperialist policy is to seize other countries as its own colonies and war bases. What they fear most and try to undermine is the patriotic movement and the path of genuine peaceful neutrality."

　　The commentary said, "At the end of 1956, when Laos pursued a policy of peaceful neutrality and realized national harmony, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys clamored about 'Communist aggression against Laos.' They used this as a pretext for U.S. imperialist interference in Laos, supporting reactionary groups to seize power, disbanding the coalition government, creating civil war in Laos, carrying out 'sweeps,' and persecuting the people."

　　The commentary pointed out that the patriotic actions of the Lao people, army, and police overthrew the reactionary government, the lackeys of U.S. imperialism, and established the legal Souvanna Phouma government, which declared the implementation of a genuine policy of peaceful neutrality. "This is a victory for the Lao people who demand national harmony, and a heavy defeat for U.S. imperialism and its lackeys."

　　The commentary then emphasized that now "U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are once again trotting out the cliché of 'Laos being threatened by Communism.'" The commentary specifically mentioned that the Thai authorities' radio station openly declared the policy of peaceful neutrality to be a 'dangerous policy,' a 'policy that opens the way for Communist invasion of Laos.' This is precisely the pretext they use to interfere in Laos, to help the Phoumi Nosavan group oppose the legal Phouma government, and to suppress the anti-American national salvation movement of the Lao people."

　　The commentary pointed out that the United States and its lackeys "use U.S. aid and weapons to support the Phoumi Nosavan group, instigating it to concentrate its forces, attack Vientiane, and impose an economic blockade on Vientiane, sending agents and spies to infiltrate Vientiane to create internal disputes in Laos."

　　The commentary particularly exposed Thailand's dangerous actions under U.S. instructions. The commentary pointed out that the Thai authorities are deploying troops along the Mekong River and airdropping special agents into Lao territory to carry out sabotage activities. In addition, Thailand openly recognizes the Chao Somsanith-Phoumi Nosavan traitorous government that has been overthrown by the people.

　　The commentary concluded: The interference of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in Laos makes us see more clearly the truth of their utter defeat, panic, and madness. No matter how blatantly they carry out their vicious and despicable conspiracies, they will never be able to subdue the Lao people's patriotic spirit. On the contrary, this will further arouse the hatred of the Lao people and peace-loving people around the world for U.S. imperialism and resolutely oppose them. The conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against Laos will suffer a heavy defeat, just as they have in other places.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, August 24th: The "Cambodia Telegraph" pointed out on the 24th that Phoumi Nosavan, during his brief stay in Thailand after the coup in Vientiane, reportedly "held secret talks in a confidential meeting with Sarit Thanarat."

　　The newspaper said that the decision to establish an anti-coup committee "could not have been made without the approval of the Bangkok authorities."

　　The "Cambodia Telegraph" said that Sarit also intended to use starvation to force the Phouma government to comply. The newspaper said that such measures were "de facto support for Nosavan's anti-coup committee."

　　The "Cambodia Telegraph" believes that the current struggle in Laos is a profound struggle between two opposing approaches—neutralism or neutrality and a pro-Western policy.

    谴责美帝国主义干涉老挝内政
    柬埔寨报纸揭露泰国支持诺萨万集团的阴谋
    新华社河内25日电　寮国战斗部队电台8月23日发表评论，严厉谴责美帝国主义和它在东南亚的走狗对老挝的干涉。
    评论指出，“美帝国主义政策的目的是霸占其他国家作为自己的殖民地和战争基地。他们最害怕的并设法破坏的是爱国运动和真正的和平中立的道路”。
    评论说，“在1956年底，当老挝奉行和平中立政策和实现民族和睦的时候，美帝国主义及其走狗便大肆叫嚣‘共产主义侵略老挝’，并以此作为美帝国主义干涉老挝、扶植反动集团攫取政权、解散联合政府、制造老挝内战、进行‘扫荡’、迫害人民的借口。”
    评论指出，老挝人民、军队和警察的爱国行动推翻了美帝国主义的走狗——反动政府，成立了合法的梭发那·富马政府，这个政府并宣布实行真正的和平中立政策。这是要求实现民族和睦的老挝人民的胜利，是美帝国主义及其走狗的惨重失败”。
    评论接着着重指出，现在“美帝国主义及其走狗又放出‘老挝遭受共产主义的威胁’的陈词滥调。评论特别提到泰国当局的广播电台公开地宣布和平中立政策是‘危险的政策’，是‘为共产主义侵入老挝开辟道路的政策。’这正是他们干涉老挝、帮助富米·诺萨万集团反对合法的富马政府，镇压老挝人民的反美救国运动的借口。”
    评论指出，美国和它的走狗“用美援和武器支持富米·诺萨万集团，嗾使它集中兵力，进攻万象，并在经济上封锁万象，派遣特务、间谍潜入万象，以制造老挝内部的纠纷。”
    评论特别揭露在美国指示下泰国的危险行动。评论指出，泰国当局正在陈兵湄公河沿岸，并在老挝领土空降特务，进行破坏活动。此外，泰国还公开承认已经被人民推翻的昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万卖国政府。
    评论最后说：美帝国主义及其走狗对老挝的干涉，更加使我们看清了他们的惨败和慌乱、疯狂的真相。不管它们怎样明目张胆地推行它们恶毒、卑鄙的阴谋，也绝不能压服老挝人民的爱国主义精神。相反的，这将进一步激起老挝人民和世界上爱好和平的人民对美帝国主义的仇恨并坚决反对它们。美帝国主义及其走狗对老挝所进行的阴谋必将像在其他地方一样遭到沉重的失败。
    新华社金边24日电　“柬埔寨电讯报”24日指出，据说富米·诺萨万在万象政变后在泰国作短暂逗留期间，“在守秘密的同乃沙立的会晤中举行了秘密商谈”。
    这家报纸说，作出建立反政变委员会的决定，是不会不得到“曼谷当局的赞同的”。
    “柬埔寨电讯报”说到乃沙立还打算用饥饿来逼迫富马政府。这家报纸说，这样的措施是“对诺萨万的反政变委员会的事实上的支持”。
    “柬埔寨电讯报”认为，老挝目前的斗争是两种对立的方针——中立主义或中立和亲西方政策——之间的一场深刻的斗争。
