    Remembering a Comrade-in-Arms
    He Guyan
    In 1951, on the war-torn Korean battlefield, I met a Korean comrade-in-arms—Yin Hongji. Our acquaintance was a chance encounter. One moonlit night, our unit was advancing south along the highway when suddenly a military truck drove up from the opposite direction. The truck stopped not far from me, and a Korean People's Army comrade jumped out. He strode up to me and said, as if to an old friend, "Got a cigarette?"
    I liked the straightforwardness of this revolutionary soldier. I immediately took out my cigarette case from my pocket and offered it to him. By the flickering red light of the cigarette, I saw that his thick eyebrows were covered with dust. I asked, "Where are you coming from?"
    "The 38th Parallel." The People's Army comrade took a deep drag on his cigarette and asked me, "Comrade, where are you going?"
    "The 38th Parallel..."
    The People's Army comrade laughed heartily, extended his strong hand and shook mine tightly, saying, "Thank you, we're going to Sukchon to pick up supplies. We'll meet again on the front lines."
    American planes droned in the gray night sky, dropping bombs and flares from time to time. Beside us, a torrent composed of infantry, artillery, trucks, and militia stretcher teams was surging south. The People's Army comrade looked at this torrent of people and steel and said, moved, in broken Chinese, "China, Mao Zedong, great..." After saying this, he shook my hand once more and hurried onto the truck. I didn't have time to ask his name; I only knew that he was my comrade-in-arms.
    In war, unexpected miracles often occur. After the Fifth Campaign, I actually ran into that People's Army comrade again. On a mountain ridge near the 38th Parallel, our fortifications were connected to those of the People's Army. One morning, a People's Army captain walked over from the trench. He had a red face, broad shoulders, and a row of gleaming white teeth. Seeing those thick eyebrows, he looked strangely familiar, but I couldn't remember where I had seen him before. The People's Army comrade had a better memory. He walked over, gripped my hand tightly, and said, "Don't you recognize me? ...Do you remember that night by the Ryesong River when I asked you for a cigarette?" His words reminded me. We embraced and jumped up and down in the trenches. This time, I learned that the People's Army comrade was named Yin Hongji.
    From then on, we became close friends. Comrade Yin would come to our shelter whenever he had time. We taught each other Chinese and Korean. We often sat up late into the night by the dim lamplight, talking intimately, discussing our hometowns, the current battles, and the future... Differences in nationality and unfamiliarity with the language didn't affect the exchange of our feelings in the slightest.
    In our initial interactions, I felt that Comrade Yin was an emotionally melancholic person. There was one incident in particular. One day, Comrade Yin and several other comrades were playing cards in the shelter when the sound of aircraft machine guns suddenly rang out from outside. Comrade Yin handed his cards to someone else and quietly went out. A dozen minutes later, I found him sitting alone on a large rock behind the fortifications, staring unblinkingly westward, his face turned very somber. I asked him why he wasn't playing anymore. Comrade Yin said, "I don't feel like playing..." At this point, I noticed four American Mustang fighter planes circling and diving in the western sky. Those hateful black shadows would disappear behind a small hill for a moment and then rise up again. The machine gun fire we had just heard was coming from there.
    Comrade Yin made room for me to sit down on the edge of the rock and slowly said, "People's personalities are different. Some people can still sing when enemy planes are bombing and strafing. Some Korean girls are like that. The more fiercely the enemy bombs, the louder they sing, even as they watch their houses burn and their belongings destroyed. They still sing, singing the People's Army March, singing the Song of General Kim Il-sung... They are using their songs to demonstrate against the enemy, to fight back against the enemy with their songs. People like me will never sing when the enemy is bombing and strafing. I don't even feel like talking; I just want to figure out how to shoot down the American planes and tear those aerial bandits to pieces!"
    Just then, two or three gray plumes of smoke shot up from behind a small hill to the west. Comrade Yin stared at the plumes of smoke rising straight into the sky, gritting his teeth and saying, "Look, I don't know how many more old people and children have been killed by American planes, burned to death..."
    Just then, I saw that Comrade Yin's eyes were red with emotion. At that moment, I thought: his eyes had seen the destruction of so many beautiful villages, so many innocent compatriots falling into pools of blood under the strafing of American machine guns... How much anger and hatred were buried in his broad chest!
    Several nights later, I was returning from the front lines when I met Comrade Yin again at a fork in the road. At that time, the Kaesong negotiations were underway. From where we were standing, we could see a silver-white beam of searchlight pointing straight into the sky in the southwest. That was the marker for the Panmunjom neutral zone. Comrade Yin asked me for some news about the negotiations, saying, "Do you think the peace talks have any hope?" I shook my head and said, "The Americans are playing tricks again. It looks like we'll have to give them another good beating before they'll be honest!" Comrade Yin grunted and said, "Exactly right! What are the Americans? We Koreans know them best. Anyone who says that American imperialism isn't a man-eating beast, but a dove of peace, the Korean children will spit in his face!"
    The longer we spent together, the more I came to understand that Comrade Yin also had his moments of excitement and joy. I remember once, it was raining heavily, and Comrade Yin went to carry out a mission near Kaesong and rushed back in the rain. He ran into my shelter, not even bothering to change his wet clothes, first opening a small tin box, taking out a well-preserved "Mount Kumgang" brand cigarette, handing it to me and lighting it for me, saying, "You try our best Korean cigarette too... How is it? Not bad, is it?"
    Judging from his expression, Comrade Yin was experiencing great pleasure because he had given a precious gift to his comrade-in-arms.
    After the two of us finished that precious cigarette, Comrade Yin told me a story he had heard near Kaesong: One day, the cars of the American delegation participating in the Kaesong negotiations passed through a village that had been destroyed by American planes. The members of the American delegation sat in their cars, chewing on Korean apples, whistling, and throwing candy to the Korean children standing in the ruins. At the same time, a group of Western journalists who were serving the United States opened their cameras and movie cameras, preparing to record the so-called "benevolence" that the United States was giving to the Korean people. However, that group of Korean children knew very well how to respond to the enemy's insults. They crushed those American candies under their feet and picked up stones and tiles from the ruins to throw at the shouting Americans. The steel helmets on the heads of the American soldiers rang out, and countless white marks were left on the sides of the jeeps. The children shouted, "Americans get out!" and scattered in all directions.
    It was the first time I had seen Comrade Yin so excited. After telling the story, his face was flushed, tears of joy welled up in his eyes, and he said repeatedly, "These are our good Korean children, good children..." If those Korean children had been there at that time, Comrade Yin would have hugged them tightly, kissing them one by one, praising them as the pride of their nation!
    After the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, Comrade Yin and I parted ways. At the time of parting, Comrade Yin held my hand tightly, as if he had a lot to say, but didn't know where to start. Finally, he asked me, "Will we meet again in the future?" I said, "We will meet again." Comrade Yin smiled knowingly, shaking my hand and saying, "Yes, if the enemy restarts the war against Korea and against China, we will meet again on the front lines!"
    Seven years have passed, and many things have faded from memory, but the shadow of Comrade Yin has remained active in my mind. I often miss this Korean comrade-in-arms, miss those Korean people who fought back against the American robbers with guns, with songs, and with stones. I like their clear-cut love and hatred, and I admire their heroic steadfastness. In today's anti-American tide sweeping the globe, I feel even more the preciousness of the heroic character of the Korean people.

    忆战友
    和谷岩
    1951年在战火弥漫的朝鲜战场，我认识了一位朝鲜战友——尹洪吉。我们是在一个偶然的机会里相识的。在一个月色蒙蒙的夜晚，我们的部队正沿着公路向南挺进，忽然从对面开来一辆军用卡车，车子开到离我不远的地方停下了，从车上跳下来一位朝鲜人民军同志。他大步走到我身边，像对老朋友似地说：“有纸烟吗？”
    我喜欢对方那种革命军人的爽快。立刻从衣袋里掏出烟盒来送过去。借着纸烟那一闪一闪的红光，我看到对方那浓密的眉毛上沾满了灰尘。问道：“你们从哪儿来？”
    “三八线。”人民军同志狠狠地吸了一口烟，问我：“同志，你们到哪儿去？”
    “三八线……”
    人民军同志爽朗地笑起来，伸出结实的大手紧握着我的手说：“谢谢，我们到肃川去拉东西，咱们会在前线上再见面的。”
    美国飞机在灰蒙蒙的夜空中哼哼着，不时丢着炸弹和照明弹。在我们身旁，一条由步兵、炮车、卡车和民兵担架队汇成的洪流，正奔腾着向南方流去。人民军同志望着这人和钢铁的洪流，感动得用不熟练的中国话说：“中国，毛泽东，伟大……”说完，又一次和我握过手，匆匆上车去了。我没有来得及问他的姓名，我只知道他是我的战友。
    战争中常常会出现意想不到的奇迹。在五次战役之后，我居然又和那位人民军同志碰到一起了。在“三八线”附近的一条山梁上，我们的工事和人民军的工事连接着。一天早晨，从交通沟那头走来一位人民军大尉，红脸庞，宽肩膀，整齐的白牙齿闪着光。看到那两道浓密的眉毛，我觉得怪面熟，但一时想不起在什么地方见过面来了。还是人民军同志记性好，他走过来紧紧握住我的手说：“不认识了？……你还记得那天晚上在礼成江边向你要过纸烟的那个人吗？”一句话把我提醒了。我们拥抱着在战壕里跳起来。这次见面我才知道人民军同志叫尹洪吉。
    从此以后，我们成了密友。尹同志一有空就到我们掩蔽部里来玩。我们互相学习中国话和朝鲜话。我们常常守着豆大的油灯，促膝谈心直到深夜，我们谈着自己的家乡，谈着当前的战斗，谈着未来……国籍不同，语言不熟悉，丝毫没有影响我们感情的交流。
    在最初的相处中，我觉得尹同志是个感情忧郁的人。曾经有过这样一件事。一天，尹同志和另外几个同志正在掩蔽部里玩扑克，外边传来咕咕的飞机机关炮声。尹同志把手里的扑克交给别人，悄悄地出去了。十几分钟以后，我发现他一个人在工事后面的一块大石头上坐着，目不转睛地望着西方，脸色变得很阴沉。我问他为什么不玩了，尹同志说：“不想玩了……”。这时，我注意到有四架美国野马式飞机，正在西边天空中盘旋、俯冲。那可恶的黑影，一会儿被小山挡住，一会儿又升起来。方才听到的机关炮声就是从那里传来的。
    尹同志让出石头的一角让我坐下，慢慢说：“人的性格是不一样的。有的人在敌机轰炸扫射的时候，还能唱歌，我们朝鲜有些姑娘就是这样，敌人轰炸得越厉害，她唱得越凶，眼看着房子被烧了，东西毁了，她还在唱，唱人民军进行曲，唱金日成将军之歌……她们是在用歌声向敌人示威，用歌声反击敌人。我这样的人，在敌人轰炸扫射的时候，是永远不会唱歌的。我连话都懒得说，心里就只想如何把美国飞机打下来，把那些空中强盗撕成碎片！”
    就在这时，西边一座小山的背后，窜起了两三个灰色的烟柱。尹同志望着那直冲云霄的烟柱，咬牙切齿地说：“看，不知又有多少老人孩子被美国飞机打死了，被火烧死了……”
    就在这时，我看到尹同志激动得眼圈红润了。当时我就想：他的这双眼，不知道已看见过多少美丽村庄的毁灭，多少无辜的同胞在美国的机关炮扫射下，倒在血泊里……他那宽阔的胸中，埋藏着多少愤怒与仇恨呵！
    几天之后的一个夜晚，我从前沿回来，在一个三岔路口又和尹同志会面了。那时，开城谈判正在进行。从我们站的地方就可以看到，西南方向有一条银白的探照灯光柱直指星空。那是板门店中立区的标志。尹同志向我询问了一些关于谈判的消息，说道：“你觉得和平谈判有希望吗？”我摇摇头说：“美国人又在耍流氓，看来还要痛痛地揍它一顿，它才可能老实下来！”尹同志嗯了一声说：“完全对！美国人是什么东西，我们朝鲜人最清楚。谁要说美帝国主义不是吃人的野兽，而是一只和平鸽，朝鲜的小孩都要唾他的脸！”
    相处久了，我渐渐了解，尹同志也有他的兴奋和欢乐。记得有一次，天正下着大雨，尹同志到开城附近去执行了一次任务，冒雨赶了回来。跑进我的掩护部，他连湿衣服都顾不得换，首先打开一个小铁盒，把一支保存得很好的“金刚山”牌纸烟递给我，并给我点着说：“你也尝尝我们朝鲜最好的纸烟……怎么样？味道不错吧？”
    从表情上看出，尹同志因为把一点珍贵的礼物送给了自己的战友，他正享受着巨大的愉快。
    我们两个人合抽完了那支珍贵的纸烟，尹同志向我讲述了一个他在开城附近听到的故事：一天，参加开城谈判的美方代表团的汽车从一个被美机毁灭了的村庄通过。美方代表团人员坐在汽车上，嚼着朝鲜苹果，打着口哨，把糖果丢给在废墟上站着的朝鲜孩子。与此同时，一群为美国效劳的西方记者打开了照相机、电影摄影机，准备记录下美国给朝鲜人民的所谓“恩惠”。但是，那一群朝鲜孩子却十分懂得如何回答敌人的侮辱。他们狠狠地把那些美国糖果踩碎，从废墟上拣起石头瓦块向狂叫着的美国人掷去。美军头上的钢盔被打得叮当响，吉普车帮上留下了无数白印。孩子们高呼着“美军滚蛋！”一哄而散。
    我第一次看到尹同志那样兴奋，故事讲完，他的脸色绯红，眼里涌出了欢乐的泪花，连连说：“这是我们朝鲜的好孩子，好孩子……”假如那些朝鲜孩子当时在跟前的话，尹同志一定会把他们紧紧地抱起来，一个个亲他们，夸他们，这是自己民族的骄傲啊！
    朝鲜停战协定签定后，我和尹同志分别了。临别时，尹同志紧紧握着我的手，好像有一肚子话要说，又不知从何说起。最后，他问我：“我们以后还会见面吗？”我说：“还会见面的。”尹同志会意地笑了，摇着我的手说：“对，假如敌人重新挑起对朝鲜和对中国的战争，我们还会在前线上见面的！”
    七年过去了，许多事情印象已经淡薄，但尹同志的影子却一直活跃在我的脑海里。我时常怀念这位朝鲜的战友，怀念朝鲜那些曾用枪炮，用歌声，用石块还击美国强盗的朝鲜人民。我喜欢他们的爱憎分明，我敬佩他们的英勇坚贞。在反美浪潮席卷全球的今天，我更加感到朝鲜人民英雄性格的可贵。
