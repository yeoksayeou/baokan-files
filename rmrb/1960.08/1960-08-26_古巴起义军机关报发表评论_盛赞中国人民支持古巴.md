Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 24th - The Cuban Rebel Army newspaper "Rebelde" published a commentary stating that Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's speech on August 15th at the reception given by the Ambassador of North Korea to China celebrating the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea, aroused great interest in Cuba. Premier Zhou Enlai announced in his speech that the Chinese people firmly support the heroic Cuban people in their just struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and in defense of national sovereignty. The Chinese people are willing to give the Cuban people, who are fighting for independence and freedom, all possible assistance without any conditions attached.

The newspaper commentary said: "The Chinese Premier's speech is a new force supporting the Cuban revolution, a force that helps safeguard the Cuban revolution against the insidious attacks of monopoly groups. These monopoly groups are trying to regain the privileges that were abolished by the just and necessary laws enacted by the Cuban revolutionary government."

The commentary emphasized: "At this moment, which is decisive for Cuba, the support of socialist countries, the support of the enslaved peoples of the Americas, and the support of the distant, suffering African peoples who are fighting for liberation, is a warning to imperialism: should they dare to launch an aggression against us, the earth will crack beneath their feet, and the flames of uprising will burn them to ashes."

    古巴起义军机关报发表评论
    盛赞中国人民支持古巴
    新华社哈瓦那24日电　古巴起义军机关报“绿橄榄树报”发表评论说：中华人民共和国总理周恩来8月15日在朝鲜驻华大使庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年招待会上的讲话，在古巴引起了极大的兴趣。周恩来总理在讲话中曾经宣布：中国人民坚决支持英勇的古巴人民反对美帝国主义侵略，维护国家主权的正义斗争。中国人民愿意给为独立自由而斗争的古巴人民一切可能的援助而不附带任何条件。
    报纸评论说：“中国总理的讲话是支持古巴革命的一支新的力量，这支力量有助于维护古巴革命，反对垄断集团对古巴革命的阴险的进攻。这些垄断集团企图重新取得被古巴革命政府颁布的正义的和必需的法律所取消的特权。”
    评论强调指出：“在对古巴具有决定意义的现在这个时刻里，社会主义国家的支持，美洲受奴役的各国人民的支持以及正在争取解放的遥远的苦难的非洲人民的支持，是对帝国主义的警告：假如他们竟然发动对我们的侵略，大地将在他们的脚下开裂，起义的火焰将把他们烧成灰烬。”
