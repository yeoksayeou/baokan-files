Some Experiences in Shaping the Image of Workers and Peasants
    Li Yalin
    I am a young actor, young in age and shallow in experience, with a low level of political and ideological understanding, and a lack of rich professional experience.

    In 1958, at the beginning of the Great Leap Forward, in order to more quickly improve our acting skills and shape the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Party issued us a militant call, urging us to break superstitions, establish great ambitions, go deep into life, transform our thinking, and organized us to go to factories, rural areas, and the military in batches at different times; to share weal and woe with the working people, to learn from the working people, to transform our thinking, and to establish proletarian thoughts and feelings.

    For more than two years, under the specific care and cultivation of the Party, I have been to many places: Nanmazhuang in Fenyang County, Shanxi, the Ming Tombs Reservoir, the seamless steel tube factory of Anshan Iron and Steel, rural areas in the suburbs of Changchun, and other places. In the process of getting along with the masses and local cadres, it has played an extremely important role in my ideological transformation. However, due to my lack of hard work and my lack of deep ideological transformation, there are still many problems in creating roles.

    In the late summer of 1958, I received the task of filming "Young People in Our Village," and the role I played was called Gao Zhanwu. The process of my filming this role was also the process of my self-transformation. There was such a scene: Kong Shuzhen was washing vegetables under the cliff, and Li Keming came to ask Kong what she needed to bring before returning to his hometown to get explosives. At the same time, he spoke ill of Gao Zhanwu in front of Kong. This happened to be heard by Gao Zhanwu, who was walking on the cliff. After hearing this, Gao smiled slightly and walked to the construction site indifferently. This scene mainly showed Gao Zhanwu's broad mind: when his personal interests and personal self-esteem were touched, he dismissed it with a smile; but if anyone wanted to damage the interests of the Party or the interests of the people, he would never tolerate it in the slightest. This understanding of Gao Zhanwu was correct, but when I embodied it on the screen, it was not what I imagined. It looked like Gao Zhanwu was a little narrow-minded and a little jealous of Li Keming. There was also a scene where Gao Zhanwu, knowing that his beloved Kong Shuzhen was also being loved by Cao Maolin, resolutely decided to give up his own interests and help Cao Maolin and Kong Shuzhen get along well. But he was not without pain in his heart, so he used work to replace his inner pain. Because only work could make Gao Zhanwu forget everything. This scene mainly showed Gao Zhanwu's communist ideological style and the noble character of putting the construction of the motherland and the cause of the Party above everything else. But when I embodied it on the screen, when Gao Zhanwu swung his hammer at work, he looked like he was venting his emotions. Why did I understand it that way, but the embodiment was not what I understood? With the help of comrades, I realized that I didn't really understand it, and my understanding was a framed understanding lacking a perceptual basis. Therefore, it was replaced by the unhealthy thoughts and feelings that I possessed.

    "Young People in Our Village" was filmed in 1958 and re-shot once in 1959. The first example was remedied in the second re-shot, and the second example, because it was filmed during the second re-shot, was still the same as before when it was shown on the screen.

    Therefore, I deeply realize that if we want to create good heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, we must transform our bourgeois individualistic thoughts and emotions and establish proletarian thoughts and feelings, otherwise it will inevitably bring losses to creation or distort the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    关于塑造工农形象的一点体会
    李亚林
    我是一个青年演员，年纪轻，经历浅，政治思想水平低，缺乏丰富的业务经验。
    1958年开始大跃进的时候，为了更快提高我们的表演水平，塑造工农兵的英雄形象，党向我们提出了战斗的号召，要我们破迷信，树雄心，深入生活，改造思想，并组织我们在不同的时间里，分批去工厂、农村、部队；要我们与劳动人民同甘共苦，向劳动人民学习，改造自己的思想，树立无产阶级的思想感情。
    两年多以来，在党的具体关怀与培养下，我去过许多地方：山西汾阳县的南马庄，十三陵水库，鞍钢无缝钢管厂，长春郊区的农村及其他的地方。在和群众和当地干部相处的过程中，对我思想改造起着极为重要的作用。但是由于自己的刻苦努力不够，对自己的思想改造还不深，因而在创造角色的时候还存在着许多问题。
    1958年夏末，我接到了拍摄《我们村里的年轻人》这部戏的任务，我扮演的角色叫高占武。我拍摄这个角色的过程，也是我自我改造的过程。有这样一场戏：孔淑贞在崖下洗菜，李克明在回乡取炸药前，来问孔需要带什么东西不？同时他又在孔的面前说高占武的坏话。这时正好被在崖上走过的高占武听见了。高听后微微笑了一下，毫不在乎地就走向工地了。这场戏主要是表现了高占武宽阔的胸怀：当触到他个人利益和个人自尊的时候，一笑置之；但如果是谁要损害党的利益、人民的利益的时候，他是绝不能有丝毫宽恕的。这种对高占武的理解是对的，但等我体现在银幕上的时候，就不是我想像的样子了。看上去，高占武有些心胸狭窄，有些忌恨李克明的样子。还有一场戏是当高占武知道了自己心爱的孔淑贞，也在被曹茂林爱着的时候，他就毅然决定舍弃自己的利益，帮助曹茂林和孔淑贞好。但他的心中并不是没有痛苦的，因此他就用工作来代替他内心的痛苦。因为只有工作才能使高占武忘记一切。这场戏主要是表现了高占武的共产主义思想风格，祖国建设、党的事业高于一切的高贵品德。而我体现在银幕上的时候，当高占武抡起大锤在工作的时候，却是一副发泄自己情感的形象。为什么自己是那样理解，而体现出来却不是自己理解的样子呢？经过同志们的帮助，我才明确了，原来我并没有真正的理解，我的理解是架空的缺乏感性基础的理解。因此也就被自己身上所具有的不健康的思想感情所代替了。
    《我们村里的年轻人》在1958年拍摄以后，1959年又补拍过一次。第一个例子在第二次补戏中得到了弥补，第二个例子因为是第二次补戏时拍的，所以表现在银幕上的还是那个样子。
    因此，我深深地体会到，要想创造好工农兵的英雄形象，就必须改造自己资产阶级个人主义的思想情绪，树立无产阶级的思想感情，否则就必定会给创作带来损失或歪曲了工农兵的英雄形象。
