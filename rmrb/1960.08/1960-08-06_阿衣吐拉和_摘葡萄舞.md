　　Ayitula and the "Grape Picking Dance" By our reporters Tan Feng and Song Zhenghou
　　　　·From Rural Girl to Actress·
　　Ayitula was born and raised in Kuche County, the famous song and dance hometown of Xinjiang. There is a local saying: "Children learn to dance when they can walk, and sing when they can talk." However, before liberation, the rich Uyghur folk dance art was almost driven to extinction under the discrimination and trampling of the reactionary rule. At that time, Ayitula and her mother lived a very poor life, relying only on her mother's sewing and washing for the landlord's family to beg for two bowls of leftover soup and rice. She had no time to think about dancing. After liberation, the people began to live a free and happy life, and Uyghur dance was reborn. Influenced by the new environment, Ayitula loved dancing. In 1952, Ayitula moved to Aksu with her mother, living next door to the special district song and dance troupe, which brought great joy to Ayitula. She abandoned all play and only went back and forth in the song and dance troupe every day. When the actors practiced dancing, she stood aside, watching intently for hours; when the actors performed on the stage, she sneaked behind the scenes to learn to dance. The song and dance troupe leaders quickly discovered Ayitula's great enthusiasm and serious attitude towards dance. They valued her talent very much, and after solemnly obtaining her mother's consent, they accepted her as an actress in the song and dance troupe.
　　In order to cultivate Ayitula, the song and dance troupe hired a cultural teacher for her and four other young actors, letting her practice dancing for half a day and study culture for half a day. The Party branch also assigned experienced veteran actors to teach her basic dance movements. However, the most important thing was to create opportunities for her to go deep into the countryside and learn rich ethnic dances. During the land reform, general election, and production movements in the countryside, the song and dance troupe toured the countryside all year round, taking Ayitula with them every time, partly to let her participate in performances to improve her dance skills, and partly to let her learn folk dances. What she remembers most is that in order to cultivate her, the organization sent her to Awat, the hometown of "Dao Lang Dance," for three months of study. "Dao Lang Dance" is the oldest type of Uyghur folk dance, originating in Makit and extremely popular in Awat. Every harvest or festival, farmers gather in the moonlit square to dance to the sound of the clanging hand drums. Ayitula danced "Dao Lang Dance" with the farmers every day. Initially, she could never do well in the solo spinning competition of "Dao Lang Dance." After three months of hard study, Ayitula had become a famous "Dao Lang Dance" performer in Awat. In 1955, in order to further her studies, the Party organization transferred her to the Autonomous Region Song and Dance Troupe. The Party's cultivation enabled Ayitula to make rapid political progress. When she was eighteen, she joined the Communist Youth League.
　　Ayitula mostly danced relatively simple folk dances in Aksu. As a dance actress, she only had a certain foundation. When she came to the Autonomous Region Song and Dance Troupe, she was a little timid. The Party branch immediately came to help her, encouraging her to practice hard, and sent the most experienced director in the troupe to guide her in her practice, which boosted her courage.
　　The greatest characteristic of Uyghur dance is its beauty, lightness, and rich poetic quality. When dancing, it is as soft as a willow and as fast as a gust of wind. In an instant, dozens of movements must be changed from the toes, waist, arms, and even fingertips, and yet they are extremely harmonious. A dance actress cannot master it without long-term hard training. Ayitula, with the determination that "effort will naturally lead to success," practiced one movement after another. Once, the leadership asked her to learn the "Melon Planting Dance." This dance was performed by a mature actress in the troupe and had won the second prize at the Sixth World Youth Festival. The most difficult part was suddenly bending her knees and lying supine while spinning at high speed, requiring her to be as light as catkin and land silently. When Ayitula practiced for the first time, she not only hit the floor with a thud, but also broke her knees, hurting so much that tears streamed down her face. Afraid that others would find out and let her rest, she secretly wiped away her tears and insisted on practicing until she finally mastered the "Melon Planting Dance." Long-term hard training has gradually made Ayitula an excellent actress loved by the audience. She can not only dance various group dances, but also became an outstanding performer of complex solo dances such as "Noodle Making Dance," "Mischievous Girl," "Tajik Dance," and "Melon Planting Dance."
　　　　·Friends and Teachers·
　　During the Spring Festival this year, Ayitula wrote a letter to Comrade Long Zhengqiu, director of the Nanjing Military Region Frontline Song and Dance Troupe, in which she said: "...You are my good friend and my teacher. You also deserve credit for the glory of the 'Grape Picking Dance.'..."
　　Last summer, when Ayitula was preparing to participate in the Seventh World Youth Festival and came to Beijing, the Ministry of Culture sent the experienced art director Long Zhengqiu to help her.
　　Long Zhengqiu cared for Ayitula in life like a younger sister, but he was very strict with her performance. He would ask "Why like this?" for every movement. He told Ayitula that when performing a certain plot, she must express the corresponding emotions from her whole body and face. In order to make up for her shortcomings in this regard, Long Zhengqiu patiently explained the meaning of each movement to her, showing her how to do it until she met the requirements. For example, the side bend at the beginning of the dance, which resembles an obliquely inserted willow, was the most difficult to learn. Long Zhengqiu held her and practiced for five days. He even taught her the subtle reactions such as the different expressions when a girl tastes sour grapes and sweet grapes dozens of times. Under Long Zhengqiu's careful coaching, Ayitula quickly mastered every detail of the "Grape Picking Dance," making the beautiful dance and the plot highly compatible. It was officially listed as a performance item to participate in the Seventh World Youth Festival and won a gold medal.

    阿衣吐拉和“摘葡萄舞”	本报记者　谈风　宋政厚
        ·从农村姑娘到演员·
    阿衣吐拉幼年生长在新疆著名歌舞之乡库车县，当地有一句俗话：“小孩子会走路时就会跳舞，会说话时就能唱歌。”但是，在解放以前，丰富的维吾尔民间舞蹈艺术在反动统治的歧视、践踏之下，几乎陷于绝境。那时，阿衣吐拉随着母亲度着十分贫困的生活，只靠母亲给地主家缝缝洗洗，讨得两碗残汤剩饭，那有心思跳舞。解放后，人民才开始过自由幸福的生活，维吾尔舞蹈也获得了新生。阿衣吐拉在新的环境影响之下，酷爱舞蹈。1952年，阿衣吐拉随母亲迁居阿克苏，正好和专区歌舞队毗邻而居，这给阿衣吐拉带来了极大快乐。她摈弃了一切玩耍，每天只在歌舞队里穿来穿去。演员们练舞，她站在一旁，几个小时一动不动地出神看着；演员在前台表演，她溜到幕后学着跳。十二岁的阿衣吐拉对舞蹈的这种巨大热情和认真的态度，很快就被歌舞队负责人发现了，他们非常重视她的天赋，并且郑重地征得了她母亲的同意，吸收她为歌舞队的演员。
    为了培养阿衣吐拉，歌舞队为她和另外四个小演员请了文化教员，让她半天练舞，半天学文化。党支部还指派了有经验的老演员教她练习舞蹈的基本动作。但是，最重要的还是为她创造了深入农村、学习丰富的民族舞蹈的机会。在农村土改、普选和生产运动中，歌舞队终年在乡下巡回演出，每一次都要带上阿衣吐拉，一面让她参加演出，提高舞蹈技巧，一面让她学习民间舞。使她最难忘的是组织上为了培养她，派她到“刀郎舞”之乡阿瓦提的三个月学习，“刀郎舞”是维吾尔民间舞蹈中最古老的一种，起源于麦盖提，而在阿瓦提极其盛行。每当丰收或节日里，农民们都聚在月夜的广场上，伴着铿锵的手鼓声起舞。阿衣吐拉每天和农民在一起跳“刀郎舞”，最初，在“刀郎舞”的单人旋转竞赛中，她总是跳不好。经过三个月的刻苦学习，阿衣吐拉已经成了阿瓦提有名的“刀郎舞”手了。1955年，党组织为了使她得到进一步深造，调她到自治区歌舞团。党的培养，使阿衣吐拉政治上的进步也很快，在她十八岁的时候，参加了共青团。
    阿衣吐拉在阿克苏跳的多半是比较朴素的民间舞，作个舞蹈演员，她只是具备了一定的基础。来到自治区歌舞团，她有些胆怯了。党支部立刻来帮助她，鼓励她苦练，并派了团里最有经验的导演指导她练习，鼓起了她的勇气。
    维吾尔舞最大特点，是优美、轻捷而富诗情，跳起来柔如杨柳，迅若飘风，一瞬间，从足尖、腰、两臂以至指尖要变换几十种动作，而又极其和谐。一个舞蹈演员不经过长期刻苦锻炼是无法练好的。阿衣吐拉抱着“功到自然成”的决心，一个动作一个动作练起。有一次领导上要她学“种瓜舞”。这个舞是由团里一个成熟的演员担任的，曾经获得第六届世界青年联欢节的二等奖。最难的部分，是在飞速旋转之时，突然屈膝仰卧，要求做到轻如飞絮，着地无声。阿衣吐拉第一次练习时，因抓不住要领，不但碰得地板咚咚响，双膝也跌破了，疼得她眼泪直往外滚。她怕别人发现，让她休息，偷偷擦干眼泪，依然坚持练习，终于练好了“种瓜舞”。长期艰苦的锻练，使阿衣吐拉逐渐成长为一个受观众爱戴的优秀演员，她不仅能跳各种集体舞，而且成了“拉面舞”、“调皮的姑娘”、“塔吉克舞”、“种瓜舞”等复杂的单人舞的出色表演者。
          ·朋友和老师·
    今年春节期间，阿衣吐拉给南京军区前线歌舞团的导演隆征秋同志写了一封信，信中说：“……你是我的好朋友，又是我的老师，‘摘葡萄舞’的光荣也有你一份。……”
    去年夏天，阿衣吐拉准备参加第七届世界青年联欢节来到北京的时候，中央文化部派了有经验的艺术导演隆征秋来帮助她。
    隆征秋对阿衣吐拉在生活上像对小妹妹一样的关怀，但对她的表演却要求得非常严格。每一个动作他都要问“为什么这样？”他告诉阿衣吐拉，表演怎样的情节，就要从全身、从脸上表现出怎样的感情。为了弥补她这方面的不足，隆征秋耐心地为她讲解每一个动作的含意，手比口说，直到作到合乎要求为止。例如，舞蹈开头，有一个像斜插杨柳的侧弯腰动作最难学，隆征秋扶着她练了五天，甚至像表现姑娘尝酸葡萄和甜葡萄时不同的表情等这些细致的反应，也教她练了几十次。在隆征秋的精心教练之下，阿衣吐拉很快掌握了“摘葡萄舞”的每一个细节，使优美的舞姿和情节达到了高度吻合，被正式列为参加第七届世界青年联欢节的表演项目，并获得了金质奖章。
