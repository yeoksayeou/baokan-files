Xinhua News Agency, Lisbon, August 8th: A special court in Lisbon recently brazenly sentenced José Margro, a member of the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party, to ten years in prison and fifteen years of deprivation of political rights on trumped-up charges. After serving his sentence, Margro will also be subjected to three years of "security measures" equivalent to house arrest, and this measure can be extended continuously for another three years. The unreasonable verdict against Margro is one of the most serious persecutions of Portuguese patriots by the Portuguese Salazar dictatorial regime recently. This persecution has aroused angry protests from upright people at home and abroad in Portugal.

    葡共中委马格罗被无理判处徒刑
    新华社8日讯　里斯本消息：里斯本一个特别法庭最近以莫须有的罪名悍然判处葡萄牙共产党中央委员会委员约瑟·马格罗十年徒刑和褫夺政治权利十五年。马格罗在刑满后还要遭受等于软禁的三年“安全措施”，而且这种措施还能不断续延三年。对马格罗的无理判决是葡萄牙萨拉查独裁政权最近迫害葡萄牙爱国者的最严重的判决之一。这种迫害激起葡萄牙国内外正直人士的愤怒抗议。
