    Going Deep into the Grassroots, Grasping to the End
    Wang Jingren, Secretary of the CCP Zijing County Committee, Guangdong Province

    In the past two months, we have gone deep into the forefront of production, to production workshops, construction sites, and furnaces, sharing food, lodging, labor, and discussions with the masses. In particular, participating in and leading production at Bao'shan Iron Smelting Plant, a key iron smelting enterprise in our county, has yielded significant results. The relationship between cadres and the masses has been further strengthened, the masses have been mobilized more broadly and deeply, and a new high tide of production has emerged. Bao'shan Iron Smelting Plant's pig iron production increased by 62.2% in June compared to May, and the average daily output from July 1st to 23rd increased by another 66.2% compared to June. In terms of basic construction, the engineering completed in fifteen days exceeded the progress of the past one hundred and fifty days. During this time, I personally experienced and gained some insights.
        Sharing Weal and Woe in Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

    In June, I and Comrade Luo Shaohui, Minister of the County Party Committee's Industry Department, and twelve others came to Bao'shan Iron Smelting Plant. This plant is our county's "small foreign group" iron smelting base, and this year it is responsible for more than half of our county's pig iron production, and its basic construction tasks are also very heavy. However, the foundation of this factory is very poor, it is merged of an iron mine established in 1958 and an iron factory put into production in May this year.

    When leaders come to the grassroots, they must take the lead and share weal and woe with the masses in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Although many dormitories have been built at Bao'shan Iron Smelting Plant, they still cannot fully meet the needs, and a batch of thatched sheds have also been built. As soon as I and all the comrades in the work group arrived at the factory, we moved into the thatched sheds next to the furnace, taking the first step of "four togethers." Under the influence of our action, more than thirty cadres in the factory also gave up their new dormitories and new offices for the workers to live in.

    I lived with the workers, ate with them, worked with them every day, and discussed problems together, and became close friends with each other. They told me everything. One day, a mining worker said to me: "Our canteen is not well run. Sometimes we can't get hot meals. The canteen is not hygienic, and the taste of the dishes is sometimes bland and sometimes salty." This worker's words made us pay attention to the canteen problem. The canteen of Bao'shan Iron Smelting Plant could have been run well, because they can basically supply their own vegetables, and the commercial departments are also doing their best to supply them. The key lies in strengthening leadership. Based on these circumstances, we decided to go deep into the kitchen as cooks to understand the thoughts, work, and lives of the kitchen staff.

    When we arrived in the kitchen, we heard the cooks discussing: "Cooking is not easy, it is difficult to please everyone," "Cooking is easy to be complained about." In response to these thoughts of the cooks, we held a meeting of five members including cooks, sideline production, service, medical staff, and logistics to study specific issues to improve meals and to help the cooks establish a sense of responsibility and glory for cooking. At the same time, we went to the kitchen ourselves and set a system of cadres taking turns to be cooks. In just one week, the canteen's appearance was completely new, basically achieving five goods: cooked rice, hot rice, sufficient rice, good variety, varied dishes with good seasoning, good sideline food production, good hygiene and cleanliness, and good service attitude.
                Solving Problems Practically

    Since the leaders have gone to the forefront of production, they must go deep into reality, conduct practical investigations, and solve problems in a down-to-earth manner.

    Bao'shan Iron Smelting Plant spent one hundred and fifty days in the first half of this year to build two three-cubic-meter blast furnaces, and several more blast furnaces are under construction, with a fairly slow progress. On June 1st, the day I arrived at Bao'shan Iron Smelting Plant, I heard cadres say that the speed of furnace construction was slow because materials could not be transported to the construction site. There was a river in front of the furnace construction site, and the trucks transporting materials could not drive to the construction site, and had to be transported manually in the middle. I asked, "Why not build a bridge?" A deputy director of the Industrial Bureau replied, "It was decided to build a regular highway bridge, but cement, wood, and technicians have not arrived, so it has not been built." After hearing this, I thought to myself: "During the Liberation War, when we went south, we crossed even bigger rivers. Can't we quickly build a bridge here?"

    When I went to the site, I saw that the river was only seven meters wide, the flow rate was very small, the slopes on both sides were very large, and the riverbed was a solid stone. As long as stone piers were piled up on both sides and wood was placed in the middle, a simple bridge for cars to pass could be built. I told everyone my opinion on building a temporary bridge, and everyone agreed. That evening, I and all the comrades of the County Party Committee's work group took off our trousers and shirts, jumped into the river, moved stones, and built piers. The workers who got off work saw us working vigorously, and automatically signed up to participate. More and more people participated, and finally reached more than one hundred and forty people. In just two hours, a simple bridge was built. The next morning, trucks transported building materials for the construction of blast furnaces directly to the construction site. In the first half of June, two three-cubic-meter blast furnaces were built, completing the workload of the past one hundred and fifty days.

    Before "July 1st," the employees of Bao'shan Iron Smelting Plant launched a new upsurge in production. In order to ensure sufficient fuel, the whole factory actively rushed to transport fuel. We also took the lead in picking up carrying poles and baskets and went up the mountain with the workers to transport fuel. Many hands make light work, and in just four days, we transported back 68.72 tons of fuel, and the average daily output of pig iron increased by 3.3 times compared to the past.

    Looking back, we only did our due work, but the masses gave us a very good evaluation. They said: "The secretary and minister came to Bao'shan, adding luster to Bao'shan Iron Smelting Plant (two on-site meetings were held at Bao'shan Iron Smelting Plant in June)." "The secretary and minister went to the kitchen, the rice is hot and the dishes are fragrant." They also said: "The leaders care about us so much. In addition to doing a good job in leadership, they also work with us. It's really hard for them. What does it matter if we suffer a little!" As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses was unprecedentedly high, and the work style and working methods of the cadres in the factory have also improved a lot.

    Vivid facts prove that only by truly going deep can leaders truly discover problems; only by truly discovering problems can they truly solve problems. Only in this way can we grasp firmly, specifically, and to the end in everything.

    深入基层　一抓到底	中共广东省紫金县委员会书记　王景仁
    近两个月来，我们深入生产第一线，到生产车间、工地、炉旁，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，特别是到我县重点炼铁企业——宝山炼铁厂参加生产领导生产，收效很大。干部和群众的关系进一步密切了，群众发动得更广更深，生产出现了新的高潮。宝山炼铁厂生铁产量6月比5月份增长62.2％，7月1日至23日的平均日产量又比6月增长66.2％；基本建设方面，十五天完成的工程超过了以往一百五十天的进度。在这当中，我身历其境，有所感受。
        衣食住行同甘共苦
    6月间，我和县委工业部部长罗少辉同志等十二人，来到了宝山炼铁厂。这个厂是我县的“小洋群”炼铁基地，今年担负着我县一半还多的生铁生产任务，基本建设任务也很重。但是这个厂的基础很差，它是由1958年搞起来的一个铁矿和今年5月才投入生产的铁厂合并而成的。
    领导人来到基层，就必须身先士卒，衣食住行和群众同甘共苦。宝山炼铁厂的宿舍虽然建了不少，但仍不能完全满足需要，还搭了一批茅棚。我和工作组全体同志，一来到厂里就住进炉边的茅棚，迈开了“四同”的第一步。在我们这一行动的影响下，这个厂的三十多名干部也把新宿舍、新办公室让出来给工人住了。
    我和工人住在一起，吃在一起，天天跟班劳动，遇到问题一起商量，彼此交了知心朋友。他们无话不同我说。有一天，一个采矿工人跟我说：“我们的食堂办得不好，有时候吃不到热饭，食堂里不卫生，菜味时淡时咸。”工人这段话引起了我们对食堂问题的重视。宝山炼铁厂的食堂本来是可以办好的，因为他们的蔬菜可以基本自给，商业部门也尽力供应，关键在于加强领导。根据这些情况，我们决定深入厨房当炊事员，了解炊事人员的思想、工作和生活。
    到了厨房，就听到炊事员议论：“炊事工作不好做，一人难合千人意”，“炊事工作，就容易落埋怨。”针对炊事员的这些思想，我们一面召开炊事、副业生产、服务、医务、总务等五员会议，研究改善伙食的具体问题，帮助炊事员树立对炊事工作的责任感和光荣感；一面自己下厨房，并定出了干部轮流当炊事员的制度。仅一个星期，食堂面貌就焕然一新，基本实现了五好：饭熟、饭热、米足、多样好，菜色多样调味好，副食品生产好，卫生清洁好，服务态度好。
                切切实实解决问题
    领导人员既然走到了生产第一线，就必须深入实际，踏踏实实地考察问题，切切实实解决问题。
    宝山炼铁厂今年上半年用了一百五十天时间才建成了两座三立方米高炉，还有几座高炉正在建设，进度相当迟缓。6月1日，我到宝山炼铁厂那天，就听到干部说，建炉速度不快是因为材料运不进施工现场，建炉工地前面有一条河，运材料的汽车开不到施工现场去，中途要人工搬运。我问：“为什么不架一座桥？”一位工业局的副局长回答说“决定要建正规公路桥，而水泥、木材、技术工人没有到，所以没有建”。听了这番话，我心里想：“解放战争中，南下的时候，再大的河也过去了，这里的河就不能很快架起桥来吗？”
    到现场一看，原来这条河只有七米宽，流量很小，两边斜坡很大，又是坚固的石底河床，只要两边堆起石墩，中间架上木头，一座通行汽车的简易便桥就可以建成了。我把建便桥的意见跟大家一说，人人赞成。当天傍晚，我和县委工作组全体同志就脱下长裤、衬衫，跳到河里，搬石头，建桥墩。下班的工人看到我们干得热火朝天，都自动报名参加，人越来越多，最后达到了一百四十多人。仅用了两个小时，一座简易便桥就造成了。第二天早晨，一辆辆汽车便将建高炉用的建筑材料直接运到工地。6月上半月建成了两座三立方米的高炉，完成了以往一百五十天的工作量。
    “七一”前夕，宝山炼铁厂职工掀起了新的生产高潮。为了保证燃料充足，全厂积极抢运燃料。我们也带头拿起扁担、箩筐和工人一道上山挑运燃料。众人拾柴火焰高，仅仅四天的时间就运回燃料六十八点七二吨，生铁平均日产量比以往提高三点三倍。
    回顾一下，我们仅仅做了应做的本身工作，而群众却给了我们很好的评价。他们说：“书记、部长到宝山，给宝山铁厂增了光（6月份在宝山铁厂召开了二次现场会议）。”“书记、部长下厨房，饭热菜又香。”又说：“领导这样关心我们，除搞好领导工作外，还和我们一起劳动，真够辛苦的。我们苦一点又算得了什么呢！”结果，群众的干劲空前高涨，厂里干部们的工作作风和工作方法也改进了许多。
    活生生的事实证明，领导人员只有真正深入下去，才能真正发现问题；只有真正发现了问题，才能切实地解决问题。也只有如此，才能做到狠狠地抓，具体地抓，事事抓到底。
