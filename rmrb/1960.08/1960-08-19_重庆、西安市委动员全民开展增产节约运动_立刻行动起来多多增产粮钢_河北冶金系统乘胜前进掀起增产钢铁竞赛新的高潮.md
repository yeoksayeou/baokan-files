    The Chongqing and Xi'an Municipal Party Committees Mobilize the Entire Population to Carry Out a Production Increase and Economy Drive
    Immediately Take Action to Greatly Increase Grain and Steel Production
    Hebei Metallurgical System Advances Victoriously, Launching a New High Tide in the Steel Production Increase Competition
    (Our report) The Chongqing Municipal Party Committee convened a meeting of the first secretaries of district and county party committees from the 7th to the 10th to seriously discuss carrying out a production increase and economy drive centered on grain and steel. The meeting requested that 80% of the existing labor force in rural areas be immediately concentrated on the front line of agricultural production to ensure the continuous leap forward in agricultural production this year; at the same time, a number of laborers should be appropriately transferred from other industrial sectors to support key coal and iron mines, pushing coal, coke, and ore production to a new high tide, and ensuring the fulfillment and overfulfillment of this year's steel production plan.
    The meeting pointed out that the current situation in industrial and agricultural production is very good. In the first seven months of this year, the total industrial output value has greatly increased compared with the same period last year. On the agricultural front, bumper harvests of spring crops have been obtained, the fruits of the early rice and early corn harvests are about to be reaped, mid-season rice will soon be harvested, and a bumper harvest of major spring crops is promising. Late autumn crops are being rushed into planting. The current task is to move forward, riding the wind and waves, to ensure the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the annual plan. The comrades attending the meeting from various counties and districts all expressed their willingness to take immediate action to push iron, coal, and ore production to a new level; to ensure that 80% of the existing labor force in rural areas is quickly concentrated on the front line of agricultural production.
    (Our report) The Xi'an Municipal Party Committee called on all city employees to take immediate action and launch a mass movement to increase production and economize, centered on grain and steel.
    On August 11, the Municipal Party Committee convened a mobilization meeting of responsible cadres from party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League organizations of major factories and enterprises, as well as responsible cadres from industrial departments at the municipal, county, and district levels. At the meeting, Lu Zhi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Municipal Party Committee, delivered a mobilization report on behalf of the Municipal Party Committee. In his report, Comrade Lu Zhi talked about the excellent situation in industrial and agricultural production in Xi'an. He said that under the correct leadership of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, Xi'an has ensured that industrial production has overfulfilled its plan every month, achieving a monthly increase in production levels.
    Comrade Lu Zhi pointed out that in order to fulfill and overfulfill the annual production plan, it is imperative to immediately launch a production increase and economy drive centered on grain and steel. He said that the Municipal Party Committee has decided that all enterprises and institutions should immediately mobilize employees to examine the implementation of the production plan for the first seven months of this year, while discussing and formulating targets and measures for the next four months or so, and continue to deeply develop the technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on "four modernizations." He called on leaders at all levels to continue to go deep into the front line of production. Leading cadres of municipal industrial departments and even secretaries and directors of factories and enterprises should spend two-thirds of their time in the third quarter going to factories, workshops, and blast furnaces to earnestly solve specific problems.
    After the meeting, all counties, districts, factories, and enterprises quickly organized relevant cadres to discuss the call of the Municipal Party Committee and mobilized all employees to conduct discussions. The Industrial Department of the Municipal Party Committee and relevant industrial departments have drawn more than 600 cadres to form working groups, led by heads of various departments, to go deep into more than 30 grassroots units to provide specific assistance.
    (Our report) According to the Hebei Daily, a large-scale competition to increase steel production is unfolding more widely on the metallurgical front in Hebei Province. At the steel production increase pledge rally held on August 11, steelmaking, ironmaking, coking, and mining workers were in high spirits, put forward measures, and were determined to work hard for 140 days to fulfill and overfulfill the annual steel production plan.
    At the meeting, Qi Quanke, Deputy Director of the Hebei Provincial Metallurgical Industry Department, reported to the province's steel front workers on the excellent situation on the province's steel front. From January to July, the output of steel, iron, and steel products in Hebei Province increased by 124.8%, 100.3%, and 95.6% respectively compared with the same period last year. He pointed out that although the past achievements are great, the production tasks for the next four months or so are arduous, and it is necessary to seize every minute and second, work hard, and quickly raise steel production to a new level. All enterprises must quickly launch a vigorous and down-to-earth production increase and economy competition movement. In the movement, it is necessary to formulate targets and measures for workshops and teams to complete plans on a monthly and ten-day basis according to the production tasks for the next four months or so, and widely mobilize employees to discuss and formulate production increase and economy plans for teams and individuals. It is necessary to focus on the weak links in production, deeply carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, and conscientiously summarize and promote advanced experience, directing the spearhead of innovation to greatly increasing production and economizing on raw materials. At the same time, it is also necessary to continue to improve labor efficiency and save labor. Leading cadres at all levels of the metallurgical system must adhere to going deep into the front line, conscientiously grasp measures, and immediately solve problems when they are discovered.
    At this conference, workers from steelmaking, ironmaking, coking, mining, and other factories and mines unanimously expressed their firm response to the Party's call and immediately launched a new upsurge in the production increase and economy competition movement.
