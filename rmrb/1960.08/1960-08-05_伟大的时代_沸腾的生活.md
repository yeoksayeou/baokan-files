    The Great Era, The Seething Life	Hua Jia
    Today we are in an era of high-speed socialist construction, a great era radiating the brilliance of the Party's General Line. We literary and art workers are incredibly fortunate to be in this great era, in such a seething life. The earth-shattering heroic spirit of the workers and peasants, their noble qualities of selflessness, the surging life scenes, the resonant high-pitched tunes – there are truly endless outstanding figures to write about and countless heroic poems to sing. How can we literary and art workers not sing wholeheartedly in such a great era, in such a seething life!
    I work in Guangdong. The drama workers of Guangdong, like the literary and art workers of the whole country, are singing for our great era with high spirits and soaring ambition. Taking just the first half of this year as an example, there has been a creative upsurge that quickly reflects modern life. According to incomplete statistics, during the upsurge of the urban people's commune movement, twenty-one new plays were produced in May alone, including the drama "Sunshine Shines on Every Home" and the Cantonese opera "Ten Thousand Homes in Spring," which were relatively popular among the masses. Some time ago, there were twenty-two dramas, operas, dance dramas, and various opera genres reflecting the Xiang Xiuli incident, twenty-eight reflecting the Ma Kou incident, and eleven reflecting the South China Sea rescue of fishermen incident, and even more reflecting the new people and new things in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Why did this year's creative upsurge come so early and become even more widespread? It should be said that this is the result of the Party's leadership, putting politics in command, and vigorously launching mass movements. Our drama troupes have implemented the system of going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, and decentralizing to the communes. After working and living with the masses, they have initially transformed their worldviews and been educated by the enthusiasm of the workers and peasants in building socialism. Therefore, they have reaped a double harvest in thought and creation. Of course, it cannot yet be said that these works are worthy of our era; it should be said that they are still far from this requirement. However, since we have had such a good start, as long as we resolutely follow the Party's and Chairman Mao's line on literature and art, constantly go deep into the front line of production, temper and transform ourselves, and constantly improve our ideological and artistic levels, more people will definitely be able to write more and better works in the future.
    Comrade Lu Dingyi's congratulatory speech on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council at the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers gave our literary and art workers a great education and great strength. This is a combat program for future literary and art work. We must work with full vigor and confidence, and work in a down-to-earth and dedicated manner, advancing along the socialist literary and art road pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao. The congratulatory speech stated: "The primary task of our country's literary and art work is to use the weapon of literature and art to greatly improve the socialist and communist ideological awareness of the people of the whole country, and to improve the communist moral qualities of the people of the whole country. In order to achieve this goal, we must wage a long-term and unremitting struggle against bourgeois ideology." We must always remember the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, resolutely implement the policy of going deep into life, tempering and transforming our own worldviews, and truly integrating with the workers and peasants. Only by firmly standing on the position of the proletariat, arming ourselves with Marxism-Leninism, and mastering Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, this best weapon, can we wage an irreconcilable struggle against modern revisionism and all kinds of bourgeois literary and art ideas, can we correctly understand this great era and seething life, and can we vividly, clearly, and accurately reflect our era of the socialist Great Leap Forward, and write more and better and more beautiful works to serve the socialist construction cause and the broad masses of workers, peasants and soldiers.

    伟大的时代　沸腾的生活	华嘉
    今天我们正处在高速度建设社会主义的时代，这是党的总路线光芒四射的伟大时代。我们文艺工作者处在这个伟大时代里，处在这样沸腾的生活中，是无比幸福的。工农群众的移山倒海的英雄气概，舍己为人的崇高品质，汹涌澎湃的生活场景，绕梁三日的高亢调子，真是写不尽的风流人物，唱不完的英雄诗篇。这样伟大的时代，这样沸腾的生活，教我们文艺工作者又怎么能够不尽情地歌唱呢！
    我是在广东工作的。广东的戏剧工作者，和全国的文艺工作者一样，也是意气风发、斗志昂扬地为我们的伟大时代而歌唱。只以今年上半年为例，就出现了一个迅速反映现代生活的创作高潮。据不完全的统计，在城市人民公社化运动的高潮中，仅5月份一个月，就产生了二十一个新剧目，包括话剧《艳阳普照万家春》和粤剧《万家春》等比较受广大群众欢迎的剧目在内。而前一些时候，反映向秀丽事件的话剧、歌剧、舞剧和各种戏曲的剧目有二十二个，反映马口事件的有二十八个，反映南海抢救渔民事件的有十一个，至于反映工农业生产大跃进中的新人新事的就更多了。为什么今年的创作高潮来得特别早而且更加广泛了呢？应该说这是党的领导、政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的结果。我们的戏剧团体实行了上山下乡、下放公社的制度，和群众同劳动同生活后，初步改造了世界观，为工农群众的建设社会主义的斗争热情所教育，因此思想和创作两丰收了。当然，还不能说这些作品已经无愧于我们的时代了，应该说距离这个要求还是很远的。但是，既然有了这样良好的开始，只要按照党和毛主席的文艺路线坚决走下去，不断地深入生产第一线，锻炼改造自己，不断地提高思想水平和艺术水平，今后一定可以有更多的人写出更多更好的作品来。
    陆定一同志代表党中央和国务院所作的在全国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会上的祝词，给了我们文艺工作者以很大的教育，也给了我们很大的力量。这是今后文艺工作的战斗纲领，我们一定要干劲十足、信心百倍而又踏踏实实、埋头苦干，按照党和毛主席指出的社会主义文艺道路前进。祝词中说：“我国文学艺术工作的首要任务，就是用文艺的武器，极大地提高全国人民社会主义和共产主义的思想觉悟，提高全国人民共产主义的道德品质。为了达到这个目的，就必须同资产阶级思想进行长期的坚持不懈的斗争。”我们一定时刻不忘党和毛主席的教导，坚决执行深入生活锻炼改造自己的世界观，和工农群众真正打成一片。只有坚定地站在无产阶级的立场上，以马克思列宁主义武装自己，掌握毛泽东文艺思想这个最好的武器，才能同现代修正主义和形形色色的资产阶级文艺思想进行不调和的斗争，才能正确地认识我们这个伟大的时代和沸腾的生活，才能生动地、鲜明地、准确地反映我们社会主义大跃进的时代，写出更多更好更美的作品来为社会主义建设事业服务，为广大的工农兵群众服务。
