    Concentrate Forces to Fight a War of Annihilation
    Lin Shimin, Assistant Factory Director, Shenyang Metallurgical Repair and Manufacturing Plant

    Under the guidance of the thought of "the overall situation first," adopting the method of concentrating superior forces to fight a war of annihilation can produce key equipment more, faster, better, and more economically, and promote the sustained leap forward in steel production.

    Our factory mainly manufactures supporting equipment for the steel industry. In addition to the fixed plan each year, there are also tasks assigned temporarily. Whether it is a planned task or a temporarily assigned task, we adopt the method of concentrating superior forces to fight a war of annihilation for equipment urgently needed for national steel production, and treat them as the center of all the factory's work, organizing everyone from top to bottom, left and right, to work together. We give priority to manpower and materials for these key products, and mobilize workers to carry out short-term shock competitions, and engage in technological innovation and technological revolution around the key to production. Our leaders also go deep into the grassroots, and work with workers and technicians to overcome the weak links in production. This approach works very well. For example, in May of this year, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry assigned us a task: to manufacture fifty-nine reducers for metallurgical equipment within twenty days. If we followed the general conventional production, it would take at least a month to complete this batch of tasks. Because we adopted the method of concentrating superior forces to fight a war of annihilation, we delivered this batch of products on time.

    集中力量打歼灭战
    沈阳冶金修造厂厂长助理  林士民
    在“全局第一”的思想指导下，采取集中优势力量打歼灭战的方法，可以多快好省地生产重点设备，促进钢铁生产持续跃进。
    我们工厂主要是为钢铁工业制造配套设备的。每年除了固定的计划以外，还有临时下达的任务。不管是计划内的任务还是临时下达的任务，凡是国家钢铁生产所急需的设备，我们都采取集中优势力量打歼灭战的办法，把它们作为全厂一切工作的中心，组织上下左右一齐动手。把人力、物力尽先用在这些重点产品上，并动员工人展开短期突击赛，围绕生产关键大搞技术革新和技术革命。我们领导干部也深入基层，和工人、技术人员一起攻生产中的薄弱环节。这种作法效果很好。例如今年五月，冶金部交给我们一项任务：在二十天内制造五十九台冶金设备配套用的减速器。如果按照一般的常规生产，完成这批任务，至少也得一个月时间。由于我们采取了集中优势力量打歼灭战的办法，结果按时交出了这批产品。
