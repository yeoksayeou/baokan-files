Xinhua News Agency, August 1st: The Chinese People's Revolution Military Museum grandly opened on August 1st, the glorious festival of the 33rd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This museum records the great victories of the great Chinese people and their army, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, in their indomitable armed struggle against the enemy for more than 30 years, and has become a vivid classroom for our people to receive education on the experience and revolutionary traditions of people's revolutionary war.

The museum had a ten-month preview before its opening.

During the preview period, Party and state leaders such as Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Lin Biao, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, Luo Ronghuan, Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, He Long, Tan Zhenlin, Lu Dingyi, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, Ye Jianying, Wang Jiaxiang, Tan Zheng, Liu Lantao, Yang Shangkun, Luo Ruiqing, Deng Zihui, Guo Moruo, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Bainqen Erdini Qoigyi Gyaincain, Xie Juezai, Zhang Dingcheng, and marshals of the People's Republic of China visited the Revolutionary Military Museum successively.

During the preview period, Zhang Yunyi, Xu Haidong, Xiao Jingguang, Wang Shusheng, Su Yu, Fu Zhong, Xiao Hua, Gan Siqi, Zhang Zongxun, Zhang Aiping, Yang Chengwu, Liu Yalou, Fu Qiutao, Yang Yong, Li Zhimin, Peng Shaohui, Li Juikui and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, famous figures in the capital, and people from all walks of life, totaling more than 600,000 people, also visited the Revolutionary Military Museum.

Diplomatic envoys of various countries to China, foreign experts in Beijing, and foreign guests visiting China were also invited to visit during the preview period.

Today, the Chinese People's Revolution Military Museum is decorated with red flags. The majestic music of the "Chinese People's Liberation Army March" resounds loudly. From 8:00 a.m., the golden gates of each hall were opened simultaneously.

Led by General Luo Ruiqing and General Xu Guangda, a team of generals and combat heroes, full of vigor, entered the spacious hall of the museum first. Following them was a team of officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, dressed in neat and mighty uniforms. More than 30,000 workers, peasants, students, members of urban people's communes, and cadres of government offices in the capital also entered the exhibition halls in order today with excitement and reverence. On display here are more than 20,000 historical relics and pictures from various periods, from the birth of the Chinese Communist Party to the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, the defense of socialist construction, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Here, there are instructions, writings, and manuscripts of our great leader Chairman Mao guiding the Chinese revolution in various periods; there are various commemorative relics, heroic deeds, and a large number of meritorious weapons of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, hundreds of millions of militiamen, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, who fought arduously and heroically annihilated the enemy under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong's military thought; there are physical objects, pictures, models, and important war trophies of famous battles in various revolutionary war periods; there are deeds and relics of martyrs such as Fang Zhimin, Zuo Quan, Yang Jingyu, Zhao Yiman, Dong Cunrui, and Huang Jiguang; and there are various relics and souvenirs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army growing and strengthening in the flames of war.

These cultural relics vividly tell people that without the people's armed forces, there would be nothing for the people. Chairman Mao's great Marxist-Leninist military thought on the people's army and people's war is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the Chinese revolution. The Chinese people must continue to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's military thought, build a strong and modern revolutionary army, vigorously develop militia divisions, and strive to oppose American imperialist aggression, liberate our territory of Taiwan, and defend the motherland and world peace.

Revolutionary veterans and heroes who have made brilliant contributions to the revolutionary cause of the great motherland and the defense of world peace were warmly welcomed and respected by the broad masses of visitors today. Many generals visited the Second Domestic Revolutionary War Hall with the audience, and every cultural relic aroused their memories and discussions. They recalled their own revolutionary combat lives and spoke highly of the unparalleled power of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant military thought. General Luo Ruiqing recited Chairman Mao's "Long March Poem" to the audience, and General Yang Chengwu told the story of their battle to forcibly cross the Dadu River in those years. Old Red Army soldier Zhong Qihan excitedly introduced to the audience in front of a charger displayed here, how he and his comrades overcame all kinds of difficulties during the 25,000-li Long March and carried this only charger of the Central Red Army from the Jiangxi Soviet area all the way to Yan'an in northern Shaanxi. In the War of Resistance Against Japan Hall and the Militia Hall, many old militia heroes of that year were surrounded by the audience. Fan Xiang, a famous militia hero of tunnel warfare in central Hebei, stood in front of the enemy-killing weapons they used and the spoils of war they seized from the Japanese invaders, and told the heroic story of the Zhao Hucun tunnel warfare seventeen years ago, when dozens of militiamen resisted more than 1,000 enemies, killing and wounding more than 200 enemies. In the Third Domestic Revolutionary War Hall, PLA combat heroes Yin Yongxin, Chen Lifu, etc., respectively told the audience the moving historical facts of how they and their heroic troops correctly applied Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thinking to defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries. Wang Daming, a naval officer who made contributions by defeating enemy warships with small gunboats in the battle to liberate the Wanshan Islands, said: "As long as we listen to Chairman Mao, we will always be victorious in every battle!" The War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Hall, which reflects the epic of the great victory of the Chinese people in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, was even more boiling today. Wan Fulai, the company commander of the company where the hero Huang Jiguang was before his death, Hu Zhanfang, the comrade-in-arms of the hero Yang Lian, Guo Enzhi, a first-class hero of the Volunteer Army, and Zheng Qi, a second-class hero, all enthusiastically accompanied the audience on their visits.
