(According to Harbin Daily News) In the technical revolution movement, Acheng Relay Factory in Harbin City promptly applied over a thousand innovation achievements from production and user units to product design. It comprehensively and thoroughly reformed over fifty types of products currently in production, simplifying product structures and improving efficiency. While ensuring product quality, it greatly saved raw materials, increased labor productivity, and achieved "one material doing the work of two, one factory being equivalent to five."

Acheng Relay Factory is a factory that produces relay protection equipment. With the continued in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movements, many users urgently needed relay protection equipment with better performance and higher quality. Facing this new situation, the Party Committee of Acheng Relay Factory decided to start from the perspectives of ease of use, manufacturing, performance improvement, and material saving, and widely mobilized the masses, issuing a battle cry to all employees: "Vigorously engage in product revolution, climb the peak of science, and strive to create uniquely styled relays!"

    The Situation Demands Revolution
However, different views and debates arose regarding whether product design needed revolution, whether it could be revolutionized, and who to rely on for revolution. After learning about these ideological situations, the Party Committee mobilized the masses to launch a great airing of views, a great debate. The broad masses of employees warmly supported the decision of the Party Committee and criticized the conservative idea that "fixed" designs could not be changed. They said, "Things are always developing from low to high. We must set high goals and create first-class relays ourselves!"

On the basis of raising ideological understanding, the Party Committee mobilized all employees to conduct a "four-check" on the structure of old products: check whether the performance is excellent, whether the structure is advanced, whether the materials used are economical, and whether processing is convenient. The factory Party Committee also widely solicited opinions and requirements from users by sending people out to visit, inviting user units to participate in the factory's relay selection meetings, and collecting information on user innovations in relays during the technical innovation and technical revolution movements as an important basis for improving product design.

    Dissecting the "Sparrow"
After mobilizing the masses for repeated discussions and research, the Party Committee decided to start with the distance protection panel, which had the largest output this year. They adopted the method of "dissecting the sparrow," disassembling a distance protection panel and displaying it publicly throughout the factory, mobilizing employees to visit and organizing employees to freely express their opinions and "give opinions" on the product. At the same time, they also organized various business departments to hold professional meetings separately, carefully study the opinions of the masses, and make overall arrangements for issues related to improving product design. In this way, while expressing opinions, researching, improving, and testing, they adopted methods such as "simplifying, shrinking, merging, and cutting" in a short period of time, and carried out four "surgeries" on the distance protection panel successively. After the new protection panel was redesigned, the raw materials consumed per unit were only one thirty-second of the original old product, but the performance was greatly improved compared to the original, and one unit could be used in place of six. Then, they used this method to "operate" on more than fifty old products, from "cutting off the appendix" to the "complete transformation" of the entire product. Relays that have been reformed have simplified structures, reduced product volume, and greatly increased the proportion of standardization, generalization, and serialization of parts. In this way, a large amount of material was saved, achieving one ton of material doing the work of two tons. The daily output of relays has exceeded more than four times the design level originally scheduled to be reached by the end of 1962, realizing "one factory being equivalent to five."

    Everything Thoroughly Tested
In the process of product revolution, Acheng Relay Factory earnestly implemented the principle of combining the free mobilization of the masses with thorough testing, which not only ensured the continuous improvement of product quality, but also ensured that the reformed new products were put into production in a timely manner. In order to carry out product revolution in a planned way and make the designed and manufactured products more perfect and more adaptable to the needs of the current development of the technical revolution movement, they divided the reform of product design into two steps. The first step was to make minor changes without affecting production; the second step was to make thorough and major changes, replacing the old models being produced with the newly designed models. At present, every time this factory reforms a product, it must go through sample trial production, repeated tests, and appraisal by a three-in-one combination group, until it fully meets the quality standards in terms of technology, efficiency, and safe production before it is finalized and put into production. For some products that have undergone major technological reforms, they are also taken to user departments for trial use before being put into production. Recently, when reforming relay protection devices, this factory successively invited users and scientific research departments to conduct seven symposia, and made careful revisions based on the more than thirty opinions put forward by these units before finally determining the design plan.

    阿城继电器厂改革产品设计成果巨大
    原料消耗省一半　生产能力增四倍
    据哈尔滨日报消息　哈尔滨市阿城继电器厂在技术革命运动中，把生产和使用单位的千余项革新成果及时用于产品设计，对当前生产的五十多种产品普遍进行了彻底改革，使产品结构简单、效率提高。在保证产品质量的条件下，大大节约了原料材料，提高了劳动生产率，实现了“一份材料干两份活，一厂顶五厂”。
    阿城继电器厂是一个生产继电保护设备的工厂。随着技术革新和技术革命运动的继续深入发展，许多用户急切需要性能更好、质量更高的继电保护设备。面对这一新情况，阿城继电器厂党委决定从便于使用、制造、提高性能、节约材料出发，广泛发动群众，向全体职工发出了“大搞产品革命，攀登科学高峰，为创造独具风格的继电器而奋斗！”的战斗口号。
    形势逼人　势在必革
    但是对产品设计要不要革命、能不能革命和依靠谁来革命，出现了不同的看法和争论。党委了解到这些思想情况以后，发动群众展开了大鸣大放大辩论。广大职工热烈拥护党委的决定，批判了“定型”设计改不得的保守思想，他们说：“事物总是由低到高不断发展的，我们要立大志，自己创造出第一流的继电器来！”
    在提高思想认识的基础上，党委发动全体职工对老产品的结构进行“四查”：查性能是否优良，结构是否先进，用料是否经济，加工是否方便。厂党委还先后通过派人外出访问，邀请使用单位参加本厂的继电器选型大会等办法，广泛征求用户的意见和要求，并收集在技术革新和技术革命运动中用户对继电器革新的情况和资料，作为改进产品设计的重要依据。
    解剖“麻雀”
    经过发动群众反复讨论研究，党委决定从今年产量最大的距离保护屏着手。他们采取“解剖麻雀”的办法，把一台距离保护屏拆开，在全厂公开展览，发动职工群众参观，组织职工大鸣大放，给产品“提意见”。同时，又组织各业务部门分头召开专业会议，认真地研究群众意见，统筹安排改进产品设计方面的问题。这样边鸣放、边研究、边改进、边试验，在短短的时间里，就采取“简、缩、并、割”等办法，先后对距离保护屏进行了四次“开刀”。经过修改设计后的新保护屏，每台所耗用的原材料仅等于原来老产品的三十二分之一，性能却比原来大大提高了，一台就可以顶六台用。接着他们又运用这种方法对五十多种老产品“开刀”，从“割盲肠”发展到整个产品的“脱胎换骨”。经过改革的继电器，由于结构简化了，缩小了产品的体积，零件的标准化、通用化、系列化的比例也大大提高。这样，就节约了大量的材料，做到了一吨材料顶两吨用。继电器的日产量已经超过了原定在1962年年底才能达到的设计水平的四倍多，实现了“一厂顶五厂”。
    一切经过试验
    阿城继电器厂在产品革命的过程中，认真贯彻执行了放手发动群众与一切经过试验相结合的原则，既保证了产品质量的不断提高，又保证了改革后的新产品及时投入生产。为使产品革命有计划地进行，使设计、制造的产品更为完善，更加适应当前技术革命运动发展的需要，他们把改革产品设计分作两步走。第一步是在不影响生产的情况下小改；第二步是彻底大改，用设计出的新型号代替正在生产的旧型号。目前，这个厂每改革一种产品，都要经过样品试制，反复试验，三结合小组鉴定，直到在技术、效能和安全生产等各方面都完全达到质量标准时，才定型投入生产。对于一些在技术上作了重大改革的产品，还拿到使用部门试用，然后再投入生产。最近这个厂在改革继电保护装置的时候，曾经先后邀请用户和科学研究部门进行过七次座谈，并根据这些单位提出的三十多条意见做了认真修改，最后才确定了设计方案。（附图片）
