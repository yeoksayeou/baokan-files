On "Earnestness"
Chang Yu, First Secretary of the CPC Dezhou Municipal Committee, Shandong Province

Chairman Mao said, "Of all things in the world, 'earnestness' is what we fear most, and the Communist Party is the most earnest." My understanding of the essential meaning of the word earnestness is a revolutionary fighting spirit and a serious and practical work style. What Chairman Mao meant by "earnestness" is to cultivate a down-to-earth, hard-working style. If it is superficial and not practical, grasping without tightening, it cannot be said to be "earnest." The effectiveness of our vigorous vegetable production is the result of implementing the earnest and pragmatic style advocated by our Party and Chairman Mao.

The vegetable production in Dezhou City has gone through the following three stages in the past three years: before 1958, more than half relied on external assistance; around "May Day" in 1959, it basically passed the test, and by the end of the year, there was a surplus; this year, there is great potential. Last year and the first half of this year, the total output of vegetables was more than 164.5 million jin. The variety has increased to seventy-five kinds. In a year and a half, more than 9.6 million jin of various vegetables were supported for large cities. Although the quantity is not large, it is a significant change from relying on external assistance for a long time to self-sufficiency and then to providing assistance to other places, a difference of just one word. The three stages we have experienced are also a process from simply organizing procurement and marketing to vigorously organizing production, and from simple consumption to doing it ourselves. The main reason why we can sing these three stages is because of the "earnest" grasp from the ideological level. In the past three years, we have had a deeper understanding of the word "earnest" in vegetable production.

After the Great Leap Forward, due to the development of industry, the increase of the urban population, the establishment of rural people's communes, the improvement of people's lives, and the development of animal husbandry, etc., each needed to occupy more vegetables, which was originally an indisputable thing. In this way, the commodity vegetables from external assistance were less, and our actual need for vegetables was more. One less and one more naturally formed a contradiction. The solution to the problem before us is to rely on self-reliance and self-reliance as the main thing, and to rely on external assistance as a supplement. This forced us to seriously consider vegetable production. Vegetable production is a major issue related to regulating and improving people's lives, and it cannot be ignored, and only allowed to be managed well. At the same time, there are many favorable conditions for vegetable production, such as short growth period, high yield, many varieties, strong adaptability, and idle land in the suburbs. In short, there is much potential to be tapped, and as long as we grasp it firmly and closely, we can achieve results. At that time, we launched a mass movement for every household to grow winter vegetables. We built earthen greenhouses, used broken houses, and used pots and jars together. As a result, Dezhou produced more than 500,000 jin of fresh vegetables for the first time in winter, breaking the superstition of many people; this was the starting point for our large-scale vegetable production. The victory of this battle not only educated the leaders but also educated the broad masses. We then put forward the slogan of "passing the test on May Day" and "having a surplus on October 1st" in 1959, and formulated a year-round vegetable production plan like grasping grain production, and established a specialized office. We gave strong support to the vegetable bases in the near suburbs in terms of materials. Therefore, the planting plans for each season of the year have been overfulfilled. In the first half of this year, we have already received more than 43 million jin, and there are still a large number of summer vegetables that are about to mature. The more vegetables we eat, the richer we become.

Vegetable production is only one thing in our entire economic work. But from this one thing, we have also deeply realized that as long as we earnestly implement the instructions of the higher party committee and take a practical and earnest spirit to treat our work, everything can be done well.

    谈“认真”
    中共山东德州市委第一书记　常玉
    毛主席说过：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”我理解认真二字的本质含义正是一种革命的战斗精神和严肃的实干作风。毛主席所说的“认真”正是要我们养成一种踏踏实实、埋头苦干的作风，如果是浮而不实，抓而不紧，便不能说是“认真”的。我们大抓蔬菜生产以后的效果，正是贯彻了我们党和毛主席所提倡的这种认真求实作风的结果。
    三年来德州市的蔬菜生产经过了这样三部曲：1958年以前一半以上靠外援；1959年“五一”前后基本过关，年底较有富裕；今年则大有可为。去年和今年上半年总产蔬菜一亿六千四百五十余万斤。品种增加到七十五种。一年半支援大城市各种蔬菜九百六十余万斤。数量虽然不大，但以我们这个原来长期靠外援过活的基础来说，变外援为自给，由自给而援外，一字之差正是个不小的变化呢。我们经历的这个三部曲也是由单纯组织收购供销到大力组织生产，由单纯消费到自己动手的过程。我们之所以能唱出这三部曲，主要是由于从思想上“认真”抓的结果。三年来，我们在蔬菜生产中对于“认真”二字是有了较深的体会。
    大跃进以后，由于工业的发展，城市人口的增加，农村人民公社的成立，人民生活的提高，饲养业的发展等等，彼此都需要占有更多一些蔬菜，这本是无可非议的事情。这样，外援的商品菜就少了一些，而我们的实需菜却又多了一些，一少一多，自成矛盾。摆在我们面前解决问题的办法，一是自力更生自己动手为主，一是依靠外援为辅。这就逼着我们来认真地考虑蔬菜生产了。蔬菜是关系到调剂和改善人民生活的重大问题，不能不管，而且只许管好。同时，蔬菜生产的有利条件极多，诸如生长期短、产量高、品种多、适应性强、城郊有闲散土地，总之大有文章可作，只要抓狠、抓紧，就能取得成效。我们当时开展了一个家家户户大种冬菜的群众运动。搞土温室，利用破房，盆盆罐罐一齐上马，结果使德州第一次在冬季生产了五十多万斤鲜菜，打破了不少人的迷信；这是我们大搞蔬菜的起点。这一战役的胜利既教育了领导，也教育了广大群众。我们接着提出了1959年“五一”过关、“十一”有余的口号，像抓粮食一样地制定了全年蔬菜生产计划，建立了专门的办事机构。在物资上给予近郊区的蔬菜基地以大力支援。因而全年各季种植计划均超额完成，今年上半年已经拿到手的有四千三百多万斤，尚有大量即将成熟的夏菜待收。蔬菜是愈吃愈富裕了。
    蔬菜生产，只是我们整个经济工作中的一件事。但就从这一件事里，也使我们深深体会到，只要认真贯彻上级党委指示，拿出踏实认真的精神来对待工作，一切事情都是能够办好的。
