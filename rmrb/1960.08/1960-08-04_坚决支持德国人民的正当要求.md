Resolutely Support the Just Demands of the German People
\t*People's Daily* Commentator

August 2nd of this year marks the fifteenth anniversary of the signing of the Potsdam Agreement. On the eve of this day, the government of the German Democratic Republic published a memorandum on the fifteenth anniversary of the signing of the Potsdam Agreement, exposing and condemning the West German militarists for following the policies of Western countries and actively expanding their armaments and preparing for war. It also pointed out that Western countries, especially the United States, bear a major responsibility for undermining the Potsdam Agreement and actively supporting the resurgence of West German militarism. Based on the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement and the current situation in West Germany, the memorandum put forward a series of measures to eliminate the danger of war caused by German militarism. This memorandum fully reflects the urgent desire of the people of the German Democratic Republic. The Chinese people fully support the solemn position and legitimate demands of the government of the German Democratic Republic and resolutely oppose the heinous act of U.S. imperialism in actively arming West German militarism.

The Potsdam Agreement, signed fifteen years ago by the anti-Hitler allied nations of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, stipulated: the complete disarmament of Germany; the elimination of all German industries that could be used for military production; the abolition of all German military organizations and the destruction of the Nazi Party and its affiliated organizations; the permanent prohibition of the revival of German militarism and Nazism; the arrest and trial of all war criminals; the elimination of Germany's war potential; the re-establishment of German political life on a democratic basis, and the participation of Germany in peaceful cooperation in international life in the future; and so on. In short, the Potsdam Agreement emphasized that German militarism and Nazism must be eradicated so that Germany could become a peaceful and democratic Germany, so that it could never again threaten its neighbors and world peace.

For the past fifteen years since the war, the Soviet Union has consistently and faithfully implemented the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement. With the full support of the Soviet occupation authorities, militarism and Nazism have long been eradicated in eastern Germany, and the peaceful, democratic, and socialist German Democratic Republic has been established. However, in sharp contrast, the imperialist countries headed by the United States have consistently undermined the Potsdam Agreement. In particular, U.S. imperialism has actively revived and armed West German militarism and has insisted on a policy of dividing Germany, obstructing German reunification. Although the war has been over for fifteen years, due to the obstruction of the imperialist countries headed by the United States, a peace treaty with Germany has not yet been concluded, and the Western occupying forces are still clinging to West Germany and West Berlin. This blatant crime of undermining the Potsdam Agreement is intolerable to the German people and to peace-loving people of all countries.

Recently, U.S. imperialism is preparing to intensify the arming of West German militarism with atomic weapons. After West German Defense Minister Strauss "visited" the United States and U.S. Army Secretary Bruck "visited" West Germany, U.S. imperialism has decided to arm the West German army with "Polaris" missiles, once again seriously violating the Potsdam Agreement. At the same time, the West German militarists and revanchists, fostered single-handedly by U.S. imperialism, have also become increasingly rampant in issuing aggressive clamors, revealing their ambition not only to annex the German Democratic Republic but also to expand into Poland and Czechoslovakia. This shows that West German militarism, which has been revived under the aegis of U.S. imperialism, has become a serious threat to European security and world peace.

The Chinese people have always resolutely supported the struggle of the government of the German Democratic Republic in resolving the German question. The Chinese people stand firmly on the side of the fraternal people of the German Democratic Republic and fight for the realization of the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, against U.S. imperialism's arming of West Germany, and for the maintenance of European and world peace.

    坚决支持德国人民的正当要求	本报评论员
    今年8月2日是波茨坦协定签订的十五周年。在这个日子的前夕，德意志民主共和国政府公布了关于波茨坦协定签订十五周年的备忘录，揭露了和谴责了西德军国主义者追随西方国家政策、积极扩军备战的罪行，并且指出，西方国家，特别是美国，应对破坏波茨坦协定和积极支持西德军国主义复活负重大的责任。备忘录根据波茨坦协定的规定和当前西德情况提出了一系列清除德国军国主义所造成的战争危险的措施。这一备忘录充分反映了德意志民主共和国人民的迫切愿望。中国人民完全支持德意志民主共和国政府的严正立场和正当要求，坚决反对美帝国主义积极武装西德军国主义的罪恶行为。
    十五年前由反希特勒的同盟国家苏联、美国、英国签订的波茨坦协定规定：解除德国全部武装；铲除可用作军事生产的一切德国工业，废除德国一切军事组织和摧毁纳粹党以及附属组织，永远禁止德国军国主义和纳粹主义的复活，逮捕和审判一切战犯；消灭德国的作战潜力；使德国政治生活在民主基础上重新建立，使德国将来在国际生活中参与和平合作；等等。总之，波茨坦协定强调，必须根除德国军国主义和纳粹主义，以便使德国成为一个和平和民主的德国，使它永远不能再威胁它的邻国和世界和平。
    战后十五年来，苏联一贯忠实地执行波茨坦协定的规定，在苏联占领当局的充分支持下，在德国东部早已根除了军国主义和纳粹主义，建立了和平、民主和社会主义的德意志民主共和国。然而，与此情况恰恰相反，以美国为首的帝国主义国家却一贯破坏波茨坦协定，特别是美帝国主义积极复活和武装西德的军国主义，并且坚持分裂德国的政策，阻挠德国的统一。战争虽然已经结束十五年了，但是，由于以美国为首的帝国主义国家的阻挠，对德和约至今一直还没有缔结，同时，西方国家占领军仍然赖在西德和西柏林。这种粗暴地破坏波茨坦协定的罪行是德国人民不能容忍的，也是爱好和平的各国人民不能容忍的。
    最近时期，美帝国主义正准备以原子武器加紧武装西德军国主义。在西德国防部长施特劳斯“访问”美国和美国陆军部长布鲁克“访问”西德之后，美帝国主义已决定用“北极星”式导弹武装西德军队，再一次严重地破坏了波茨坦协定。与此同时，由美帝国主义一手扶植的西德军国主义者和复仇主义者，也越来越猖獗地发出侵略叫嚣，暴露出了它不仅要并吞德意志民主共和国而且还要向波兰和捷克斯洛伐克扩张的野心。这表明，在美帝国主义一手扶植下重新复活的西德军国主义已成为欧洲安全和世界和平的严重威胁。
    中国人民一向坚决支持德意志民主共和国政府在解决德国问题方面所进行的斗争。中国人民坚决站在兄弟般的德意志民主共和国人民一边，为实现波茨坦协定的原则，为反对美帝国主义武装西德，为维护欧洲和世界和平而斗争。
