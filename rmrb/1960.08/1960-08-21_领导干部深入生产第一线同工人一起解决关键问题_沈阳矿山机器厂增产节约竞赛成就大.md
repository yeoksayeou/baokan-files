Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 19th: Since the launch of the production increase and economy drive at the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant at the beginning of August, remarkable achievements have been made. From the 1st to the 15th, the plant produced 52 units of equipment for iron and coal mines, breaking the old convention of not producing anything at the beginning of the month. In the production increase and economy movement, new creations and new records sprung up like mushrooms after rain, and the production level rose in a straight line.

The plant's production situation has been very good this year. The plant completed its first-half plan in all aspects fifteen days ahead of schedule; in July, the output and quality of thirteen major products were greatly improved. To further promote the production of steel and coal, the plant convened a workers' representative meeting in early August, deciding to launch a "high quality, high yield, multiple varieties, guarantee contracts, low cost, accident-free" production increase and economy competition, mobilizing the masses to discuss production plans. During the discussion of the plan, the workers put forward targets for increasing production and economizing, as well as specific measures to achieve these targets. Within a few days, the production increase and economy competition across the plant reached a climax, with new innovations and new records emerging one after another. On August 5th, Zhang Suqin of the No. 1 Metalworking Workshop, when processing the small shaft of the crusher, used rapid cutting experience and created a new record of completing 132 hours of work in eight hours; Li Jingru, the worker on the next shift, decided to catch up with Zhang Suqin after hearing the news. Li Jingru widely used advanced experience in production, improved operations, and completed 168 hours of work in eight hours, and even created higher records of completing 200 hours and 222 hours of work in eight hours. Following this, a competition to learn from, catch up with, and surpass Li Jingru swept the entire workshop. In other workshops, the competition wave was also higher than the last. Song Xichang, a worker in the iron casting workshop, manufactured crusher rollers, and because he improved the process, he increased production from five per shift for two people to six per shift for one person. After this new record spread, the old worker Jiang Guilin immediately posted a big-character poster, expressing his determination to create even newer achievements. Because of his great enthusiasm, he used advanced experience when making magnetic separator pressure plates, completing twenty-four in one shift, increasing efficiency by more than two times. Fu Jinmian and Qin Huaiyi, cutting workers in the riveting and welding workshop, when cutting 245 meters of filter screen plates, with the help of workshop cadres and technicians, used the advanced nesting method, which not only increased work efficiency by four times, but also saved 50% of materials.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the production increase and economy competition, the factory party committee secretary took personal command, and all factory leaders took turns working day and night shifts. They went deep into the production frontline, participating in production, leading production, and solving key production problems with the workers. The leaders of the riveting and welding workshop not only worked alongside the workers, but also helped the workers make plans before the shift, provided services during the shift, and conducted evaluations and congratulations after the shift, greatly stimulating the workers' enthusiasm for work.

More than one-third of the management cadres of the Beijing Special Steel Plant have been transferred to participate in production labor; all workers who were detached from production to do management work have also returned to their production posts, and leading cadres have also been transferred down to strengthen the grassroots. With the strengthening of the production frontline, the plant's steel output is rising daily. Liu Qiguang (first from the left), deputy secretary of the factory party committee, was transferred to the steelmaking workshop to serve as the general branch secretary. This is him discussing the production increase plan with the furnace workers.

    领导干部深入生产第一线同工人一起解决关键
    问题沈阳矿山机器厂增产节约竞赛成就大
    新华社沈阳19日电　沈阳矿山机器厂职工8月初开展增产节约竞赛以来，取得显著成就。1日到15日全厂生产出铁矿和煤矿用的设备五十二台，打破了过去月初不出产品的陈规。在增产节约运动中，全厂新创造、新纪录像雨后春笋般地蓬勃出现，生产水平直线上升。
    这个厂今年以来的生产情况一直很好，全厂提前十五天全面完成了上半年的计划；7月份十三种主要产品的产量和质量都有很大提高。为了进一步促进钢铁和煤炭的生产，这个厂在8月初召开了职工代表大会，决定开展“优质、高产、多品种、保合同、低成本、无事故”增产节约竞赛，发动群众讨论生产计划。在讨论计划中，职工们纷纷提出增产节约的指标和实现指标的具体措施。几天之内，全厂的增产节约竞赛就形成了高潮，新的革新创造和新纪录层出不穷。8月5日，金工第一车间张素琴在加工破带机小轴时，运用快速切削经验，首创用八小时完成一百三十二小时工作量的新纪录；下一班的工人李静茹知道消息后，决心要赶上张素琴。李静茹在生产中广泛运用先进经验，改进操作，又用八小时完成了一百六十八小时的工作量，并且连创八小时完成二百小时、二百二十二小时工作量的更高纪录。接着，全车间学、赶、超李静茹的竞赛风起云涌。在其他车间里，竞赛浪潮也是一浪高过一浪。铸铁车间工人宋习昌制造破带机托滚，因为改进了工艺方法，由过去两人一班造五个提高到一人一班造六个。这个新纪录传出后，老工人姜桂林马上贴出大字报，表示一定要创造更新的成绩。由于他的干劲大，在作磁选机压板时运用先进经验，一班完成了二十四个，提高效率两倍多。铆焊车间切料工人傅紧棉和秦怀义等，在切二百四十五米过滤器的筛板时，在车间干部和技术人员帮助下，运用了先进套裁法，不但工效提高了四倍，而且材料节约了50％。
    为了加强对增产节约竞赛的领导，工厂党委书记亲自挂帅，全厂领导干部轮流昼夜值班。他们纷纷深入生产第一线，参加生产领导生产，同工人一起解决生产关键问题。铆焊车间的领导干部不但同工人在一起跟班劳动，还在班前帮助工人订计划、班间搞服务、班后搞评比祝贺，大大激发了工人们的劳动热情。（附图片）
    北京特殊钢厂有三分之一以上的管理干部下放参加生产劳动；脱产做管理工作的工人也全部回到生产岗位，领导干部也层层下放加强基层。随着生产第一线的加强，这个厂的钢产量正逐日上升。厂党委副书记刘奇光（左一）下放到炼钢车间担任总支书记。这是他和炉前工人们在一起讨论增产计划。
