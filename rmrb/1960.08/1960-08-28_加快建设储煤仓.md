Accelerate the Construction of Coal Storage Bunkers

Building coal storage bunkers is a major event related to increasing coal production, improving transportation efficiency, and accelerating vehicle turnover. At present, coal mines across the country have newly built 186 coal storage bunkers, 72 coal storage yards, and 376 new dedicated railway lines. The complete concept of increasing coal production should be: after coal production increases, it must be quickly transported to the railway main lines. If coal enterprises only manage production and not collection and transportation, even if production increases a lot, it will still not be very convenient for coal-using units. There is much work to be done to speed up coal transportation, such as building new coal storage warehouses to expand coal storage capacity; accelerating the construction of railway branch and main lines in mining areas; stepping up the manufacturing of small locomotives, rail vehicles, and other transportation tools; and improving loading and unloading efficiency, etc. Building coal storage bunkers is an important link in completely eliminating heavy manual labor such as lifting, pulling, carrying, and shoveling in the coal loading and unloading process, and improving loading efficiency. After the YinYing Coal Mine in Shanxi built a coal storage bunker, it could continue production underground even if no vehicles came for seven days, and even if no production occurred underground for seven days, there would still be coal for loading on the surface. This allows for a fuller utilization of coal production and transportation vehicle efficiency.

Using indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods is the best way to accelerate the construction of coal storage bunkers. Because combining indigenous and foreign methods can not only utilize local materials, adapt to local conditions, save labor and materials, but also facilitate the participation of the broad masses and accelerate the construction progress. Taking the YinYing Coal Mine as an example, if this mine had built a coal storage bunker using foreign methods, it would have taken at least a year, the project cost would have been about one million yuan, and it would have required a large amount of steel materials. However, after adopting the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods, it only took 25 days to complete the entire construction, and the cost was about half that of the foreign method.

Fully mobilizing the masses and accelerating the construction of coal storage bunkers is an effective measure to promote the leap forward in coal production and ensure the increase in steel production. Larger coal mines, especially those along railway lines, which bear the responsibility of supporting steel production with coal, should seize the construction of coal storage bunkers, vigorously carry out technological revolution in loading and unloading, and make a high-speed leap forward in coal loading, unloading, and transportation.

The Shanxi Xishan Mining Bureau recently completed three more coal storage bunkers, achieving "normal transportation even without production for three days, and normal production even without transportation for three days."

### 加快建设储煤仓

    加快建设储煤仓
    建设储煤仓是关系到增产煤炭，提高运输效率，加快车辆周转的一件大事。目前，全国煤矿已新建储煤仓一百八十六座，贮煤场七十二个，新建铁路专用线三百七十六条。增产煤炭的完整概念，应该是：煤炭增产以后，要很快运到铁路干线上去。如果煤炭企业只管生产，不管集运，即便增产很多，对于用煤单位仍然不很方便。加快煤炭运输有许多工作要做，比如，新建储煤仓库，扩大储煤能力；加快矿区铁路支、干线的建设；加紧制造小火车头、轨道汽车等运输工具和提高装卸效率等等。兴建储煤仓就是彻底消灭煤炭装卸过程中的抬、拉、扛、攉等笨重体力劳动、提高装车效率的一个重要环节。山西荫营煤矿修建了储煤仓，做到七天不来车，井下可以照常生产，即使七天井下不生产，井上也有煤炭装车。这就使煤炭生产和运输车辆的利用率得到了更充分的发挥。
    土法上马，土洋结合，是加速建设储煤仓的最好办法。因为土洋结合，既可以就地取材，因地制宜，省工省料，又便利广大群众参加，加速建设进度。以荫营煤矿为例，这个矿如果按洋法建设储煤仓至少要花一年时间，工程造价需要一百万元左右，而且需用大量的钢铁材料。可是采用土洋结合的办法以后，只花了二十五天时间就全部建成了，而且造价也比洋法低一半左右。
    充分发动群众，加快储煤仓建设，是促进煤炭生产跃进，确保钢铁增产的有效措施。一个较大的煤矿，特别是铁路沿线，肩负着支援钢铁生产用煤的各个煤矿，应当抓紧储煤仓的建设，大闹装卸技术革命，使煤炭装卸运输工作来一个高速度的跃进。（附图片）
    山西西山矿务局最近又建成三座储煤仓，作到了“三天不生产照常运输，三天不运输照常生产”。
