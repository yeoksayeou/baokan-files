    Diligence and Thrift in Building a Great Undertaking
    Yu Yide

    Liu Qing's new novel "Entrepreneurial History" portrays a brilliant heroic image for us—the Communist Party member Liang Shengbao. This is a new man with a communist spirit who is wholeheartedly devoted to the collective and has no selfishness, a leader who works hard to create a prosperous life for everyone, and a tough guy who resolutely takes the socialist road. Liang Shengbao is simple, hardworking, and selfless. In order to achieve "two crops of rice and wheat" and a bumper harvest, he travels more than a hundred miles to Guo County to buy rice seeds for everyone. When he arrives in Guo County, he doesn't stay in a hotel but sleeps fully clothed in the ticket office of the station, using the base of the scale for weighing luggage as his pillow; he doesn't eat in restaurants but buys two bowls of noodle soup for five cents at a small food stall and eats the dried steamed buns he brought with him. He thinks to himself, I can't indulge in comfortable sleeping and tasty eating and spend an extra dime, buying fewer rice seeds. He wishes he could break a penny in half to use it. The material savings can be measured in dimes and quarters, but the spiritual value of this style is immeasurable.

    Liang Shengbao's rice seed purchase brings many associations and inspirations. Many Liang Shengbao-like figures appear before my eyes. Production team leader Liu Suojin spent only three yuan in total for his round trip to Beijing to attend the tenth anniversary of the National Day, which was widely praised. Liu Suojin has his own ideas: "Money that should be spent must be spent, but money that shouldn't be spent, not a penny can be spent, and even money that should be spent should be saved as much as possible." There is a soldier in the People's Liberation Army who wears a shirt with thirty-eight patches himself, while donating his brand-new clothes to compatriots in disaster areas. There is a brigade's Party branch secretary named Lao Xing who went to the provincial capital for a meeting, walking seventy or eighty miles there and back. Although there is a bus station nearby, with a fare of a yuan or so, he would rather endure more hardship himself in order to reduce the commune's expenses. He said, "These seventy or eighty miles won't make me sick or delay things. When I was a kid, I used to drive carts for people with my dad, carrying several hundred pounds for forty miles before dawn, let alone now with empty hands! During the Anti-Japanese War, we fought guerrilla warfare, didn't we walk a hundred or eighty miles in one night?" Their words are the voice of their hearts, how simple and powerful their language is, how pure and upright their hearts are, and how noble and respectable their style is!

    Marx said: "Style is the man." Liang Shengbao and the Liang Shengbao-like figures and styles are the true colors of proletarian revolutionary fighters. They are always thinking of the people and never of themselves; they only know how to work and don't seek enjoyment. Their self-denial is precisely for the sake of public service. Liang Shengbao was reluctant to spend a few cents on the road to stay in a hotel, and gave the rice seeds he bought back to everyone first; Liu Suojin didn't bring any special products back from Beijing, but bought some small booklets on rice yield enhancement experience. Their frugality is not for personal enrichment, but starts from the collective production and considers the masses.

    Liang Shengbao and the Liang Shengbao-like figures and styles are the fine traditional styles of our Party. During the long years of revolutionary war, the Party cultivated the fine style of diligence, frugality, and hard work in the troops and cadres. After liberation, although material conditions have improved a lot, people who have developed the habit still maintain this tradition of hard work and simplicity. The branch secretary Lao Xing mentioned earlier did not take the bus to the meeting because he did not forget the days of driving carts in the past, and did not forget the life of fighting guerrilla warfare during the Anti-Japanese War. That is to say, not only in the difficult years of war, but even today, when the standard of living has been greatly improved, and even in the future when social products are extremely abundant, hard work, simplicity, diligence and frugality should still become the criteria of our lives.

    Liang Shengbao and the Liang Shengbao-like figures and styles—hard work and simplicity, integrity and public service—are increasingly becoming the fashion of our entire era. Because this is not a trivial matter of personal life, but a major event concerning the country and the collective. The Party has repeatedly taught us to build the country with diligence and thrift, and to run all undertakings with diligence and thrift, and has repeatedly called on us to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy regularly and persistently, which starts from the 650 million people and from the entire socialist construction. The reason why Liang Shengbao-like figures are so diligent and thrifty is precisely a sign that the Party's call has penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people. As the People's Liberation Army soldier said well: "A family has to save money to live, let alone our big country." Just think, in such a large country as ours, if we ignore the word "saving" in building socialism at a high speed, how will it affect the speed of construction? Therefore, hard work, simplicity, diligence and frugality are not only a matter of personal lifestyle, but also a matter of attitude towards the general line. If everyone can be as hardworking, simple, selfless and devoted to public service as Liang Shengbao and Liu Suojin, and use every bit of material to the maximum extent for construction, production will surely develop faster and a strong socialist country can be built at an early date.

    It is difficult to start a business, and it is even more difficult to start a socialist business. However, proletarian revolutionaries have always struggled hard and walked towards difficulties. As Comrade Fang Zhimin said in his article "Poverty": "A clean and simple life is precisely where we revolutionaries can overcome many difficulties!" Let us always maintain and carry forward the fine style of hard work and simplicity, selflessness and devotion to public service, and create a successful socialist cause at an early date!

    勤俭创大业
    余一得
    柳青新作长篇小说《创业史》，为我们塑造了一个光辉的英雄形象——共产党员梁生宝。这是一个一心为集体、胸无半点私的具有共产主义风格的新人，一个为大伙都过富裕的日子而辛勤创业的领导者，一个坚决走社会主义道路的硬汉子。梁生宝朴素、勤劳、公而忘私。为了“稻麦两熟”，丰产丰收，他不辞劳累到一百多里地以外的郭县去为大伙买稻种。到了郭县，他住宿不进栈房，和衣睡在车站的票房里，头枕着过磅行李的磅秤底盘；吃饭不进饭馆，在小饭摊花五分钱买了两碗面汤，把临来时带的风干的馍馍送进肚里。他心里想，我不能贪图睡得舒服，吃得有味，而多花一角钱，少买点稻种。他恨不得把一分钱，掰成两半使用。物质上的节约，可以用三角、五角来衡量，而这种作风的精神价值，却是无可估量的。
    梁生宝买稻种的事，给人很多联想，也给人很多启示。我的眼前浮现了许多梁生宝式的人物。生产队长刘锁金上北京参加国庆十年的大典，一来一回总共只花了三块钱，被人传为美谈。刘锁金有他自己的想法：“该花的钱才能花，不该花的钱，一个也不能花，就是该花的钱，也要尽量节省。”解放军里有个战士，自己穿着补了三十八个补绽的衬衣，而把崭新的衣服捐给灾区的同胞。有个大队的支部书记叫老邢，到省里去开会，七八十里路，走着去，走着回来。虽然附近有个公共汽车站，票价块把钱，可是他为了减少社的开支，宁愿自己多吃些辛苦。他说：“这七八十里路，累不病，也不会耽误事，天明就走了四十里，我小的时候跟我爹给人家赶脚，好几百斤还天明四十里呢，更不用说这会儿空着手啦！抗日的时候打游击，一晚上还不是走百儿八十里吗？”言为心声，他们的语言多么朴实有力，他们的心地多么洁白磊落，他们的风格又是多么高尚和令人尊敬！
    马克思说过：“作风即人”。梁生宝和梁生宝式的人物和作风，是无产阶级革命战士的本色。他们处处为人民，从不为自己；他们只知工作，不图享受。他们的克己正是为了奉公。梁生宝路上舍不得花那几角住客栈钱，买回来稻种又尽先分给大伙；刘锁金从北京回来，没带什么特产，而买了些水稻丰产经验的小册子。他们省吃俭用，不是为了个人发家致富，而是从集体的生产出发，为群众着想。
    梁生宝和梁生宝式的人物和作风，是我们党的优良的传统作风。在长期的革命战争年月里，党培养了部队和干部们的勤俭节约、艰苦朴素的优良作风。解放以后，虽然物质条件好得多了，但已经养成习惯的人们，仍然保持着这种艰苦朴素的传统。前面说的那位支部书记老邢所以开会不坐公共汽车，就是不忘当年赶脚的日子，不忘抗日打游击的生活。这也就是说，不仅是在困难的战争年月里，即使是在生活水平已经大大提高了的今天，以至社会产品极其丰富的明天，艰苦朴素，勤俭节约，仍然应该成为我们生活的准则。
    梁生宝和梁生宝式的人物和作风——艰苦朴素，廉洁奉公，越来越成为我们整个时代的风尚。因为这不是个人生活的小节，而是关乎国家集体的大事。党一再教导我们勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业，又一再号召我们经常持久地开展增产节约运动，就是从六亿五千万人民出发，从整个社会主义建设出发的。梁生宝式的人物之所以那样克勤克俭，也正是党的这种号召深入人心的标志。还是那位解放军战士说得好：“一家过日子还要节省呢，别说咱们这么大的国家了。”试想一想，在我们这样一个大国里，高速度建设社会主义，如果忽略了多快好省的“省”字，那将会怎样地影响建设的速度呢？所以，艰苦朴素、勤俭节约不仅是一个人的生活作风问题，而且是对总路线的态度问题。人人都能像梁生宝、刘锁金那样，艰苦朴素，克己奉公，把每一分物资都最大限度地用到建设上去，生产就一定会更快地向前发展，社会主义强国也就能早日建成。
    创业难，创社会主义的大业更难，然而，无产阶级革命者从来都是艰苦奋斗，迎着困难走路的。正如方志敏同志在《清贫》一文里所说的：“洁白朴素的生活，正是我们革命者能够战胜许多困难的地方！”让我们经常保持和发扬艰苦朴素、克己奉公的优良作风，把社会主义的大业早日创建成功！
