Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th. TASS Moscow, 10th: The Soviet Union has ordered the U.S. Air Attaché to the Soviet Union, Colonel Keldon, to leave the Soviet Union. Soviet authorities have determined that Keldon engaged in activities in the Soviet Union incompatible with his status as a diplomatic official.

Keldon, along with his assistant McDonald, traveled by train to Kurgan (east of the Urals). There, they were caught red-handed engaging in activities to photograph Soviet military targets and were detained. Film containing photographs of aircraft and military-industrial targets, as well as several notebooks recording intelligence, were found on their persons. It has been determined that Keldon has undertaken multiple espionage trips in the Soviet Union over the past two years, attempting to ascertain the location of vital Soviet military and military-industrial targets.

The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a warning to U.S. Assistant Attaché McDonald.
