According to a report from the *Liberation Daily*, the leading cadres of the Shanghai Hwa Mao Woolen Mill are going deep into the masses, specifically and meticulously helping backward teams catch up with the production levels of advanced teams. Since the beginning of July, all three teams in the factory have comprehensively overfulfilled their bi-weekly production tasks, and the factory's overall production level has reached a new height.

This factory comprehensively overfulfilled its production tasks in the first half of the year. The Party branch believed that to further improve production in the second half of the year, every team must comprehensively complete its tasks. In June, Teams A and B performed very well, but only Team C failed to meet its plan. Therefore, the Party branch decided to have the factory director personally go to Team C to help them break free from their backward state and catch up with the advanced teams. After the factory director went down, he worked alongside the workers and mobilized the cadres and workers of Team C to examine the reasons for their backwardness. Based on the information provided by everyone, the leaders found that the main reason for the team's backwardness was the lack of unity among the team cadres. The deputy foreman, group leaders, and other seven key personnel were each managing their own affairs, and they didn't have a clear understanding of the overall production of the team. Moreover, the factory leaders had not provided sufficient assistance to them in the past.

After identifying the reasons for Team C's backwardness, the leading cadres took targeted measures to provide specific assistance. The factory director first held heart-to-heart talks with the deputy foreman, group leaders, and others, making them understand the importance of unity and mutual assistance and of leveraging the role of each cadre. Then, a meeting of team cadres was convened, inspiring them to engage in ideological exchanges. Cadres from Team B were invited to attend the meeting and share their experiences in maintaining unity and promoting production. After three meetings, the cadres eliminated their differences and unanimously expressed their commitment to not only unite themselves but also to unite the masses to quickly change their backward situation.

After the leading cadres helped the Team C cadres strengthen their unity, they addressed the issue of only a few people being concerned about production in the past, with most people having no clear understanding of whether they would complete their daily tasks. They established some necessary systems through everyone's discussion.

After the leading cadres provided in-depth and specific assistance, not only did the Team C cadres improve their work level and enhance their confidence in promoting production, but the enthusiasm of the masses also increased. Everyone unanimously put forward the slogan "Learn from Team B, Catch up with Team B." Through the efforts of all employees, the team's output has now caught up with Team B, and its quality has even surpassed Team B. Because Team C has broken free from its backward state, the factory's output and quality in July have both improved compared to the past.

    上海华贸毛织厂领导干部发扬深入细致作风
    切实帮助后进班赶上先进水平
    据解放日报消息　上海华贸毛织厂领导干部深入群众，具体细致地帮助后进班赶上先进班的生产水平。7月初以来，全厂三个班都全面超额完成了每旬的生产任务，全厂生产水平也就更上一层楼。
    这个厂上半年全面超额完成了生产任务。党支部认为，要使下半年的生产更上一层楼，就必须做到班班全面完成任务；而在6月份，甲乙两班成绩很好，只有丙班没有完成计划。因此，党支部就决定厂长亲自去丙班，帮助他们摆脱落后状态，赶上先进。厂长下去后，和工人一起劳动，并发动丙班干部和工人检查造成落后的原因。根据大家所提供的情况，领导上发现这个班所以落后，主要是班干部之间不够团结，副工长、小组长等七个骨干工作各管各，对全班生产都心中无数。而厂的领导上过去也没有很好地帮助他们。
    丙班落后原因找出以后，领导干部就对症下药进行具体帮助。厂长首先分别与副工长、小组长等促膝谈心，使他们懂得团结互助和发挥每个干部作用的重要性。然后召开班干部会议，启发他们进行思想交锋，并请乙班的干部前来参加会议，向他们介绍乙班干部团结一致搞好生产的经验。前后经过三次会议，干部消除了隔阂，一致表示不但自己要团结一致，而且要团结群众，迅速改变落后面貌。
    领导干部在帮助丙班干部加强了团结之后，又针对班里过去只有少数人抓生产、大多数人对完成当天任务心中无数的问题，通过大家讨论，建立了一些必要的制度。
    经过领导干部深入具体的帮助以后，不仅使丙班的干部提高了工作水平，增强了搞好生产的信心，而且群众的积极性也更高了。大家一致提出了“学乙班、赶乙班”的口号。经过全体职工的努力，现在这个班的产量已赶上了乙班，质量还超过了乙班。由于丙班摆脱了落后状态，全厂在7月份产量质量都比以前提高。
