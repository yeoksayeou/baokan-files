Comprehensive Assessment, Item-by-Item Finalization, and Vigorous Promotion of New Tools
Shezhen Commune's Autumn Field Management Achieves Overall Leap Forward

    (Our dispatch) To accelerate the progress of inter-tillage, Shezhen Commune in Nanyang City, Henan Province, recently convened a meeting of cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians to conduct a comprehensive review and assessment of all advanced tools within the commune, finalizing and promoting them item by item. Through assessment, nine types of advanced tools that were simple to manufacture, easy to operate, used readily available materials, and had high work efficiency were selected for a concentrated manufacturing and vigorous promotion throughout the commune. As of mid-July, a total of 4,543 various advanced tools had been manufactured throughout the commune, increasing the daily inter-tillage progress from 25,800 mu to 36,750 mu, essentially achieving a four-in-one combination of inter-tillage, topdressing, weeding, and green manure application, driving an overall leap forward in autumn field management.

    The commune's 250,000 mu of late autumn crops generally grew vigorously through the previous stage of management, but recently, due to excessive rainfall, some autumn fields experienced weed growth, creating a prominent contradiction between the shortage of labor and the large task of weeding in autumn field management. The Commune Party Committee believed that the fundamental solution to this contradiction was to vigorously promote technical innovation and technical revolution, and to promptly popularize advanced tools. To this end, the Party Committee proposed: "Comprehensive assessment, item-by-item finalization, and launch a campaign to promote ten thousand advanced tools." During the campaign, the ideological problem of some people being unwilling to use new tools was generally resolved through "investigation, calculation, debate, comparison, search, and observation." He Miao Brigade held a competition of new and old tools in the fields. Wang Changlai, the branch secretary, personally used a "Three-Convenience" weeder to weed 2.5 mu of land per hour, which was more than double the efficiency of five laborers who weeded 1.2 mu of land per hour. The masses summarized the advantages of this advanced tool on the spot.

    After unifying their thinking, the masses were highly motivated and acted quickly. To strengthen leadership over this work, the Commune Party Committee established an Advanced Tools Promotion Office, headed by the First Secretary of the Party Committee and with the Industrial Secretary in charge. It concentrated 585 iron and wood workers, established 12 tool reform factories and 64 promotion stations, and assigned 286 commune and brigade cadres to be responsible for the factories and groups, implementing a responsibility system that specifically ensured "responsible leadership, responsible tasks, responsible promotion, responsible use, and responsible results." In half a month, the commune promoted 7,543 advanced tools, such as the "Three-Convenience" weeder and the crescent-shaped leap-forward hoe.

    With the increase in advanced tools, improving usage techniques and mastering the characteristics of the tools became an important issue in large-scale promotion. To ensure good promotion, good use, and full utilization of the effectiveness of advanced tools, the Commune Party Committee, with the Shezhen Machinery Factory and the Commune Carpentry Factory as the main forces, drew 29 technicians and established four technical training classes in different areas; established nine technical instruction networks based on management areas; and established 55 technical instruction groups based on production teams. Through master-apprentice teaching, guaranteed teaching and learning, and practical operation, technical personnel were vigorously trained, and 1,885 commune members learned new technologies throughout the commune. The utilization rate of advanced agricultural tools increased from 23% to 97%.

    Due to the increase in advanced tools, the expansion of technical forces, and the improvement of utilization rates, a large amount of labor was saved, creating a new upsurge in autumn field management with inter-tillage, fertilization, and manure accumulation advancing simultaneously. Thirty-two production brigades, including Qingtai and Daiying, basically achieved the use of advanced tools for inter-tillage, saving more than 8,000 laborers who were put into other agricultural work.

    全面鉴定　逐件定型　大力推广新工具
    赊镇公社秋田管理全面跃进
    本报讯　河南南阳市赊镇公社为了加快中耕进度，最近召开了干部、老农、技术员会议，对社内所有先进工具进行了全面审查鉴定，逐件定型推广。通过鉴定、选择了制造简单、操作方便、原料广、工效高的九种先进工具，在全社范围内突击制造，大力推广。截至7月中旬统计，全社已制造各种先进工具四千五百四十三件，中耕日进度由二万五千八百亩提高到三万六千七百五十亩，基本做到了中耕、追肥、锄草、沤绿肥四结合，带动了秋田管理全面跃进。
    全社二十五万亩晚秋作物，通过前段管理普遍生长茁壮，但是最近雨水多，部分秋田发生草荒，在秋田管理中产生了劳力少与锄草任务大的突出矛盾。公社党委认为，解决这个矛盾的根本办法是大搞技术革新和技术革命，及时普及推广先进工具。为此，党委提出：“全面鉴定，逐件定型，开展万件先进工具推广运动”。在运动中，普遍通过“查、算、辩、比、找、看”解决了部分人不愿使用新工具的思想问题。何庙大队，在田间召开了新旧工具比武会，支部书记王长来亲自用一部“三便利”耘锄，一小时锄地二亩半，比五个劳力一小时锄地一亩二提高工效一倍多。群众就地总结了这个先进工具的优点。
    统一思想后，群众干劲很大，行动迅速。为加强对这一工作领导，公社党委成立了先进工具推广办公室，由党委第一书记挂帅，工业书记专抓，集中铁木工人五百八十五名，分别建立十二个工具改革厂，六十四个推广站，抽出二百八十六名社队干部包厂、包组，负责到底，具体作到“包领导，包任务，包推广，包使用，包效果”的责任制度。半月时间，全社共推广“三便利”耘锄、半月形跃进草?子等先进工具七千五百四十三件。
    随着先进工具的增多，提高使用技术、掌握工具的特点就成了大推广中的重要问题。公社党委为了做到推广好、使用好、充分发挥先进工具效能，以赊镇机械厂和公社木工厂为主，抽二十九名技术工人，分片建立了四个技术训练班；以管理区为单位，建立九个技术传授网；以生产队为单位，建立五十五个技术传授小组。通过以师带徒，包教包学，实际操作，大力培养技术人材，全社已有一千八百八十五名社员学会了新技术。先进农具使用率由23％上升到97％。
    由于先进工具的增多，技术力量的扩大，使用率提高，节约了大批劳力，出现了中耕、施肥、积肥齐头并进的秋田管理新高潮。青台、代营等三十二个生产大队，基本上实现了中耕先进工具化，节约八千多劳力投入其他农活。
