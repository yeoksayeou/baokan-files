Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, August 25th: Guided by the concept of "the whole country as a single chessboard," the Pingxiang Iron and Steel Plant in Jiangxi Province prioritizes ensuring the needs of Shanghai's steelmaking industry, completing its pig iron transfer tasks with quantity, speed, and quality. Since the beginning of this year, the plant has consistently exceeded its monthly and quarterly pig iron transfer targets ahead of schedule. It exceeded the target by 24.7% in the first quarter, 81.5% in the second quarter, 59.2% in July, and completed the entire month's transfer target ahead of schedule in the first half of August. The total amount of pig iron transferred out by the plant in seven and a half months increased by more than double compared to the same period last year. The qualification rate of pig iron supporting Shanghai has consistently been above 90%, making it a red banner in Jiangxi Province for supporting key national construction projects. For this, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued a circular commending all employees of the plant.

The main focus of Pingxiang Iron and Steel Plant's pig iron support is Shanghai's steelmaking industry. The plant's Party committee has consistently attached importance to this work, achieving great results last year. Since the beginning of this year, with the rapid development of national steel production, Shanghai's demand for pig iron has greatly increased, and the quality requirements are also higher. The plant's Party committee deeply felt that the approach of "giving iron whenever it is available, giving whatever kind of iron is available" was far from meeting the needs of Shanghai's steelmaking production. It was imperative to ensure that Shanghai received iron whenever it needed it, and that it received whatever kind of iron it needed. To this end, the principle of "ensuring Shanghai, while taking into account the province" was put forward. At the same time, the factory conducted a more in-depth education on the policy of the entire country acting as a single entity to all employees, mobilizing employees from various departments and trades to work together with one heart and mind to support Shanghai. The whole factory established the concept of prioritizing the overall situation over the individual, and prioritizing others over oneself, and deployed work tasks with the premise of ensuring Shanghai's steelmaking needs.

In order to ensure the quantity of pig iron needed by Shanghai, the plant's Party committee first launched a labor competition among all employees to "produce more iron, and ensure external transfers." Especially since July and August, all employees, on the basis of completing half of the national annual plan in the first half of the year, have launched a mass campaign to overcome bottlenecks in coke, transportation, and production spare parts, and strive for high pig iron production. In the first and middle ten days of August, the average daily output of pig iron in the whole plant increased by more than 49% compared with the same period in July, and the quality was guaranteed. In order to improve the quality of pig iron and overcome the weakness of high sulfur content in coke, employees tried every means to find many methods of desulfurization inside and outside the furnace, and reduced the sulfur content of pig iron to a minimum. The plant also strengthened quality inspection and product management systems, with checks at every level, so as not to allow a single piece of unqualified pig iron to be transported to Shanghai.

While vigorously increasing the production of pig iron, the plant's Party committee adopted the method of resolutely saving iron for self-use and compressing inventory, to ensure that how much iron was produced, that's how much iron was transferred out. The cement workshop of the factory needed to use three tons of iron to repair a ball mill. In order to save iron for self-use, the factory leaders went deep into the workshop to work with the workers to find ways, and as a result, they only used two tons of pig iron to repair the ball mill. In the past, some workers in the ironmaking workshop often used molten iron to make blast furnace parts by sand casting in front of the furnace during iron tapping. After the leadership discovered this, they immediately dissuaded this action and educated the workers to use substitutes and waste materials as much as possible to reduce the amount of iron used for self-use. The plant also established a system: the use of pig iron by any trade must be approved by the factory leaders and reported to the province for the record, so as not to misuse a single bit of pig iron.

In the process of supporting Shanghai's steelmaking with pig iron, Pingxiang Iron and Steel Plant not only ensured quality and quantity, but also ensured timely transportation. They adopted large-scale internal and external collaboration, organizing production, transportation, and sales into a one-stop system, achieving transportation as soon as the iron was produced. Outside the factory, they took the initiative to connect with the railway department and submitted a consignment plan on a monthly basis. Inside the factory, they put forward the requirement of transporting as soon as the iron was produced. Employees from various departments and trades took measures and cooperated closely around this requirement, so that production, handling, and sales were twisted into one rope. As soon as the ironmaking workers tapped the iron, they took the initiative to pile up the iron blocks for transportation. The weighing staff immediately weighed them on the spot, and the inspectors tested and classified them on the spot. The handling workers put forward the rule of clearing each furnace and each shift, and not accumulating a single piece of pig iron at the furnace side. The sales department took the initiative to grasp the daily iron production at the furnace front and promptly handled the consignment and wagon requisition procedures with the railway department, so that each furnace of iron could be loaded onto the train within 24 hours.

### 什么时候要就什么时候给　要什么样的铁就给什么样的铁  萍乡钢铁厂全力支援重点钢厂

    什么时候要就什么时候给　要什么样的铁就给什么样的铁
    萍乡钢铁厂全力支援重点钢厂
    据新华社南昌25日电　江西省萍乡钢铁厂在“全国一盘棋”的思想指导下，一切以确保上海炼钢需要为前提，外调生铁任务完成得又多又快又好。今年以来，这个厂月月季季都提前超额完成生铁外调任务。第一季度超额24.7％，第二季度超额81.5％，7月份超额59.2％，8月上半月又提前超额完成了全月外调任务。全厂在七个半月中外调的生铁总量，比去年同期增加一倍以上，支援上海的生铁合格率一贯高达90％以上，成为江西省支援国家重点建设的一面红旗。为此，中共江西省委最近通报表扬了这个厂的全体职工。
    萍乡钢铁厂外调生铁支援的重点主要是上海炼钢工业，工厂党委一贯重视这一工作，去年已经做出了很大成绩。今年以来，随着国家钢铁生产的高速发展，上海对生铁的需要量大增，质量要求也高。这个厂的党委深深感到“什么时候有铁什么时候给，有什么样铁给什么样铁”的做法，已经远远不能适应上海炼钢生产的需要；一定要做到上海什么时候要什么时候给，上海要什么样的铁就给什么样的铁。为此提出了“确保上海，兼顾省内”的原则。同时，向全体职工进行了更为深入的全国一盘棋的方针教育，发动各部门、各工种的职工一条心、一股劲，齐心协力支援上海。在全厂职工中树立了先全局后部分，先人后己的观点，一切以确保上海炼钢需要为前提去部署工作任务。
    为了确保上海所需要的生铁数量，厂党委首先发动全厂职工展开了“多出铁、保外调”的劳动竞赛。特别是7、8月以来，全体职工在上半年完成国家全年计划一半的基础上，又展开了群众性的攻关战役，大破焦炭、运输和生产备品备件关，力争生铁高产。全厂在8月上、中两旬，生铁平均日产量都比7月同期增长了49％以上，并且保证了质量。为了提高生铁质量，克服焦炭含硫高的弱点，职工们千方百计找出了许多炉内炉外层层脱硫的办法，把生铁含硫量降到了最低限度。全厂还加强了质量检验和产品管理制度，层层把关，不让一点不合规格的生铁运到上海。
    在大力增产生铁的同时，厂党委采取了坚决节约自用铁、压缩库存量的办法，保证增产多少铁，外调多少铁。这个厂的水泥车间修理一部球磨机，要求动用三吨铁，厂领导为了节约自用铁，深入车间同工人一起想办法，结果只用两吨生铁就修好了球磨机。炼铁车间部分工人，过去常常趁着出铁的时候，在炉前用铁水翻砂做高炉零件，领导上发现后，立即劝阻了这一行动，教育工人尽量利用代用品和废料，以减少自用铁。这个厂还订立了一条制度：任何工种使用生铁，必须经厂领导批准，报省里备案，做到了不乱用一点一滴生铁。
    萍乡钢铁厂在以生铁支援上海炼钢中，不仅保质保量，而且运输也很及时。他们采取厂内外大协作，组织产、运、销一条龙，做到了随产随运。在厂外，主动与铁路部门挂钩，按月提出托运计划；在厂内，提出了随产随运的要求。各部门、各工种职工都围绕着这一要求，采取措施，紧密协作，使生产、搬运、销售拧成一股绳。炼铁工人一出铁就主动把铁块堆好待运，司磅人员马上就地过磅，检验人员当场化验分类，搬运工人提出了炉炉清、班班清，不积压一块生铁在炉边的守则；销售部门主动到炉前掌握每天出铁数量及时与铁路部门办好托运要车手续，从而使每一炉铁在二十四小时之内就能装上火车。
