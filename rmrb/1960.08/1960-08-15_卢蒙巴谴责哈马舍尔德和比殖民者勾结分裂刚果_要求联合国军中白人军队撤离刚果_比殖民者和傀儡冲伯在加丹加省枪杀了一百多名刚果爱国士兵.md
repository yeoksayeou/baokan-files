Xinhua News Agency, August 14th dispatch from Léopoldville: Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba, at a press conference on the 13th, condemned UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld for colluding with Belgian colonialists and the imperialist puppet Tshombe in the Congo's Katanga province.

Lumumba said that the Congolese army and five provincial governments have requested the dispatch of Congolese troops to the Congolese Katanga province, which is controlled by Belgian troops, if the United Nations does not resolve the Katanga issue. He demanded the withdrawal of all white troops from the UN forces in the Congo. He also said that the UN Secretary-General's dispatch of white troops instead of an all-African force to Katanga province was "unjust." Lumumba added, "We hope the United Nations will continue its work—but on the condition that all white troops leave the Congo."

The Congolese Prime Minister also condemned Belgian colonialists at the press conference for continuing their conspiracies to split the Congo and undermine the Congo's independence and unity under the guise of "United Nations officials." He said that Belgian colonialists distributed inflammatory pamphlets in African residential areas of Léopoldville on the morning of the 13th. These pamphlets were printed at the "European Magazine" headquarters in Brussels but were airlifted to the Congo by Belgian airlines. In addition, he pointed out that Belgian colonialists used money to bribe Congolese spies to overthrow the government of the Congolese Republic.

Lumumba said that Belgian colonialists and their puppet Tshombe had already shot and killed 109 Congolese patriotic soldiers in Katanga province.

Xinhua News Agency, August 14th dispatch from New York: UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 13th appointed another American as a senior UN official in the Congo. Hammarskjöld appointed American McDiarmid as Bunche's administrative assistant. He wanted McDiarmid to go to Léopoldville on the 13th. As everyone knows, American Bunche, in his capacity as UN Under-Secretary-General, represents Hammarskjöld in the Congo to oversee the activities of the UN forces.

Currently, the increasing number of Americans traveling to the Congo under the auspices of the United Nations has been criticized by many African countries.

    要求联合国军中白人军队撤离刚果
    比殖民者和傀儡冲伯在加丹加省枪杀了一百多名刚果爱国士兵
    新华社14日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴13日在一次记者招待会上，谴责联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德到刚果的加丹加省同比利时殖民者以及帝国主义的傀儡冲伯进行勾结。
    卢蒙巴说，刚果军队和五个省政府都要求派刚果军队进入比利时军队控制下的刚果加丹加省，如果联合国不解决加丹加省问题的话。他要求联合国军一切白人军队撤出刚果。他还说，联合国秘书长派白人军队而不是一支全部非洲人的部队进入加丹加省，这是“不公正的”。卢蒙巴又说，“我们希望联合国继续它的工作——但是以一切白人军队离开刚果为条件。”
    这位刚果总理在记者招待会上还谴责比利时殖民者在“联合国官员”的伪装下继续在刚果进行分裂刚果、破坏刚果的独立和统一的阴谋活动。他说，比利时殖民者13日上午在利奥波德维尔的非洲人居住区散发煽动性的小册子，这些小册子是在“欧洲杂志”的布鲁塞尔总部印刷的，然而由比利时航空公司空运到刚果来的。此外，他还指出比利时殖民者用金钱收买刚果特务来推翻刚果共和国政府。
    卢蒙巴说，比利时殖民者和其傀儡冲伯在加丹加省已经枪杀了一百零九名刚果爱国士兵。
    新华社14日讯　纽约消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德13日又任命一个美国人担任联合国在刚果的高级官员。哈马舍尔德任命美国人麦克代米德为本奇的行政助理。他要麦克代米德在13日前往利奥波德维尔。大家知道，美国人本奇以联合国副秘书长的身份代表哈马舍尔德在刚果主持联合国军的活动。
    目前，有越来越多的美国人利用联合国的委派前往刚果活动，这一点已经受到许多非洲国家的抨击。
