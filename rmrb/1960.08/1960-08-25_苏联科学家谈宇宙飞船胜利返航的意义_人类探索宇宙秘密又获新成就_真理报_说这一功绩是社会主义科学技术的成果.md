Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd dispatch from Moscow: Soviet scientists continued to publish articles and give talks in newspapers on the 22nd, discussing the great significance of the Soviet Union's second spaceship and the return of the test subjects to Earth.

	Soviet Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, Fe Ding Si Ji, published an article in the Soviet "Pravda" saying that this achievement by the Soviet Union has opened up a broad path for exploring the mysterious distances of the universe. For example, we can obtain information about the characteristics of the sun, stars, and distant nebulae. These characteristics have been impossible for us to see due to the obstacles of the Earth's atmosphere. People can also gain knowledge about the structure of the Earth through spaceships. If we observe the Earth from an altitude of several hundred kilometers, we can clearly see all the characteristics of the Earth's atmospheric circulation, the geological structure characteristics of the Earth's crust, and traces of the Earth's geological history, such as huge faults that cut through the crust for thousands of kilometers.

	Professor Luo Jin Bie Er Ge published an article in "Izvestia" saying that if the experience of the rockets launched by the Soviet Union into the Pacific Ocean not long ago proved that it is already possible to ensure that spaceships reach the planets closest to us; then, now we can be sure that spaceships can safely land on the surfaces of those planets. The Soviet Union has carefully created a complex set of biological equipment that can ensure that people can live normally in a sealed cabin for a long time under the most complex and unusual external conditions (rocket ascent, weightlessness, flight through the atmosphere, and landing). This cannot but be celebrated. The creation of such complex equipment is itself a miracle of the twentieth century.

	The famous Soviet mechanic, Stru Ming Si Ji, published an article in "Izvestia" saying that the Soviet scientists' research on streamlined objects in supersonic airflow laid the scientific foundation for solving the landing problem of spaceships. After further research, the trajectory of the spaceship and the parameters of its gas dynamics and structure were finally successfully formulated to reduce atmospheric resistance and reduce the intensity of heat flow. This solved the problem of safe landing of the spaceship, and the spaceship successfully passed through the atmosphere and landed safely on the ground according to the most favorable orbit that had been predetermined long ago.

Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd dispatch from Moscow: "Pravda" published on the 22nd, Fei Dao Luo Fu's introduction on observing "Squirrel" and "Arrow" engaging in space flight using television equipment, as well as several frames of photographs taken using television equipment during their space flight.

	The report said that television observation began as soon as the satellite-type spaceship took off and continued almost until the spaceship began to land. Television observation was carried out whenever the spaceship was within the receiving range of the receiving station. At the same time, the received images were film-recorded. It is very important that every shot of these films is highly accurately linked in time with the information sent back by the telemetry system. In this way, scientists can compare what they saw on the television with what the instruments recorded when studying the negatives.

	Fei Dao Luo Fu wrote that at the moment of take-off, the dogs looked alert and confused at the bottom of the cabin. In the first few seconds of the flight, they showed anxiety and restlessness. As the speed of the spaceship increased, the gradually increasing gravity gradually pressed them to the bottom of the cabin. "Arrow" used its paws to support itself, trying to resist, looking around anxiously. Later, the animals stopped moving. The spaceship entered orbit. After experiencing huge overloads, a state of weightlessness arrived. The dogs "suspended" in the cabin. Their paws and heads drooped weakly, and at first glance, the animals seemed to be dead. After getting used to the state of weightlessness, they began to eat. By the way, the feeding trough opened automatically. "Squirrel" and "Arrow" began their first space breakfast. Later, during the flight, they would sometimes start to feel uneasy again, but gradually they adapted.

	Fei Dao Luo Fu emphasized that it was the first time in history that not only the readings of the instruments were sent back from space, but also the direct images of the actions of the "cosmic astronauts"—"Squirrel" and "Arrow"—in flight were also sent back.

Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd dispatch: According to TASS reports: The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial on the 22nd entitled "Glorious Achievement," commenting on the successful launch and return to Earth of the Soviet Union's second spaceship.

	The editorial said that the inspiring news of the unprecedented scientific feat achieved by Soviet scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers has spread all over the world. For the first time in history, living beings who made a long-distance trip around the Earth in a spaceship have returned safely.

	The editorial pointed out that the Soviet people's new scientific achievement is an important stage on the road for mankind to conquer outer space and is a brilliant result of the science and technology of our great socialist motherland. Relying on their profound understanding of the laws of physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, and other sciences, the Soviet people have created complex devices that can not only send huge spaceships into space, but also safely return them to Earth. This was one of the most important tasks faced by the Soviet space conquerors. However, the problem is not just to return the spaceship to Earth in general, but to make it land intact and accurately at a predetermined location. Otherwise, human space flight would be unimaginable. This task has also been gloriously completed.

	The launch and return to Earth of the satellite-type spaceship made by the genius of Soviet scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers is the prelude to human flight to interstellar space.

	The editorial said that the satellite-type spaceship flew around the Earth for nearly eighteen laps, flying over the major capitals and the most remote towns and villages of the world. Radio stations and radio amateurs on all continents of the world received its signals. Its signal is a symphony of victory, an ode to the creative genius of the Soviet people who created this wonderful spaceship. This spaceship is a true crystallization of the achievements of the Soviet Union's advanced science, technology, creative thinking, and labor.

	The significance of this outstanding achievement created by the Soviet people for science and progress is inestimable. It brings mankind closer to direct flight to the universe. Human entry into the universe will not only infinitely expand our understanding of the nearest celestial bodies, but also expand our understanding of our own planet, Earth.

	The editorial pointed out that the new victory of the Soviet space conquerors is an outstanding manifestation of the superiority of the Soviet socialist system and is the result of the extremely great achievements of our people in the development of economy, science, technology, culture, and education. Such a victory would not have been possible without the Party's constant concern for the progress of science and technology and for the growth and training of scientific cadres.

	The whole world applauds the achievements of the world's first Soviet socialist country. The most famous scientists in various countries have expressed admiration for the new proof of the high level of Soviet science, which is advancing by leaps and bounds.

	The editorial concluded by writing that the brilliant scientific experiment has been successfully completed. The first batch of living space explorers has returned in triumph as messengers of the great victory of our science and technology. The Soviet socialist system, the genius of the people—the builders of communism—has achieved a magnificent achievement, which has opened up a new stage in mastering the mysteries of the infinite depths of the universe. This achievement powerfully reveals the enormous possibilities and superiority of the Soviet social system, which has created all the conditions to inspire the creation of millions of people.

    苏联科学家谈宇宙飞船胜利返航的意义
    人类探索宇宙秘密又获新成就
    “真理报”说这一功绩是社会主义科学技术的成果
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学家22日继续在报纸上发表文章和谈话，论述苏联第二个宇宙飞船和试验生物返回地面的重大意义。
    苏联物理数学博士费丁斯基在苏联“真理报”上发表文章说，苏联这一成就为探索宇宙神秘的远方开辟了宽广的道路。例如，我们可以获得关于太阳、恒星和遥远的星云的形象的特点。这些特点都由于地球大气的障碍而使我们一直没法见到，人们还可以通过宇宙飞船来获得关于地球的结构的知识。如果从几百公里的高空向地球观察，可以看清地球大气循环的全部特点，看清楚地球地壳的地质结构特点和地球的地质历史的痕迹，如割裂地壳达几千公里的巨大断层等。
    罗津别尔格教授在“消息报”上发表文章说，如果说不久前苏联向太平洋地区发射的火箭的经验证明已经可以保证宇宙飞船到达最靠近我们的行星；那末，现在我们已经可以确信，宇宙飞船已经可以安全地在那些行星的表面上着陆了。苏联已经仔细地创造了一套复杂的生物学设备，可以保证在最复杂和最不平常的外界条件下（火箭上升、失重现象、穿过大气层的飞行和着陆），人能够在密封舱中长时期地正常生活。这不能不令人欢呼。创造这样复杂的设备本身就是二十世纪的一个奇迹。
    苏联著名力学家斯特鲁明斯基在“消息报”上发表文章说，苏联科学家对于在超音速气流中流线型物体的研究，奠定了解决宇宙飞船着陆问题的科学基础。经过了进一步的研究，终于成功地制定了宇宙飞船的运行轨道以及它的气体动力学和结构的参数，以减低大气的阻力和降低热流的强度。这样就解决了飞船安全着陆的问题，宇宙飞船成功地根据早就预定的最有利的轨道，穿过大气，在地面上安全着陆。
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”22日发表了费道罗夫关于利用电视装置观察“松鼠”和“小箭”从事宇宙飞行情况的介绍及几帧在它们宇宙飞行期间利用电视装置拍摄下来的照片。
    报道说，电视观察从卫星式飞船刚一起飞就开始了，并且几乎是一直进行到飞船开始着陆的时候，在飞船处在接收站接收范围内的时候，电视观察一直都在进行。同时还对接收到的影像进行了电影纪录。十分重要的是，这些影片的每一个镜头都从时间上高度精确地同遥测系统发回的情报联系在一起。这样，科学家在研究底片的时候，就可能把电视机上看到的情况同仪器记载的情况加以对比。
    费道罗夫写道，在起飞时刻，狗警觉地、困惑地看着舱底。在飞行的头几秒钟，它们表现出不安和躁动。随着飞船运动速度的增加，逐步增强的重力渐渐地把它们压在舱底上。“小箭”用爪子撑着，试图抵抗，不安地四面张望。以后这些动物就不动弹了。飞船进入了轨道。在经过巨大的超重以后，失重状态到来了。狗在舱里“悬”起来了。它们的爪子和头软弱无力地搭拉着，乍一看起来，这些动物好像是死的。习惯于失重状态以后，它们就开始进食了。顺便说一句，食槽是自动打开的。“松鼠”和“小箭”开始了第一顿宇宙早餐。以后，在飞行期间，它们有时又会开始感到不安，但逐渐逐渐就适应了。
    费道罗夫强调指出，不仅把仪器的读数从宇宙中发回来，而且把“宇宙飞行家”——“松鼠”和“小箭”在飞行中的行动的直接影像也发回来了，这还是历史上第一次。
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联“真理报”22日发表了题为“光辉的成就”的社论，评论苏联第二个宇宙飞船的顺利发射和返回地球。
    社论说，苏联科学家、工程师、技术员和工人取得史无前例的科学功勋的振奋人心的消息传遍了全世界。历史上第一次乘宇宙飞船绕地球做长途旅行的生物平安地回来了。
    社论指出，苏联人民新的科学功绩是人征服宇宙空间的道路上的重要阶段，是我们伟大的社会主义祖国科学技术的辉煌成果。苏联人依靠他们对物理、化学、数学、天文学和其他科学规律的深刻了解，创造了不仅能把巨大的飞船送到宇宙，而且能使它安全返回地球的复杂装置。　　这是苏联宇宙征服者曾面临的极重要的任务之一。但是，问题不只是使飞船一般地返回地球，而且要使它完整无损地准确地着落在预定的地点。否则，人进行宇宙飞行甚至是不可想像的。这个任务也已经光辉地完成了。
    苏联科学家、工程师、技术员和工人的天才所制造的卫星式宇宙飞船的发射和返回地球，是人飞往星际空间的前奏。
    社论说，卫星式飞船绕地球飞行了将近十八圈，飞过了世界各大首都和最偏僻的村镇，世界各大洲的无线电电台和无线电爱好者都收听到了它的讯号。它的讯号是胜利的交响乐，是对创造这一奇妙的飞船的苏联人民的创造天才的颂歌。这一飞船是苏联先进科学、技术、创造性的思想和劳动的成就的真正结晶。
    苏联人民为科学和进步所创造的这一卓越成就的意义是无法估价的。它使人开始直接向宇宙的飞行临近了，人飞入宇宙将不仅无限地扩大我们对距离最近的星体的了解，而且将扩大我们对我们自己这个星球——地球的了解。
    社论指出，苏联宇宙征服者的新的胜利是苏维埃社会主义制度优越性的卓越的表现，是我国人民在发展经济、科学、技术、文化和教育方面的极其伟大的成就的结果。只有在共产党经常关怀科学技术的进步、关怀科学干部的成长和培养的情况下，这种胜利才会成为可能。
    全世界都为世界上第一个苏维埃社会主义国家的成就而鼓掌。各国最著名的科学家都对正在大踏步前进的苏联科学的高度水平的新证明表示赞叹。
    社论最后写道，光辉的科学试验顺利地完成了。第一批有生命的宇宙探险者作为我国科学技术的伟大胜利的信使已经凯旋归来。苏维埃社会主义制度、人民——共产主义建设者的天才取得了宏伟的成就，这一成就为掌握宇宙无限深处的奥秘开创了新阶段。这一成就极其有力地揭示了为鼓舞千百万人的创造而制造了一切条件的苏维埃社会制度的巨大可能性和优越性。
