A Little Common Sense

    Virus, soft rot, and downy mildew are devastating diseases for Chinese cabbage and radishes. However, as long as we grasp their patterns of occurrence and transmission routes, we can effectively prevent and control them.

    I. Virus: Also known as "Guding," locally called "hair perm." The pathogen is a filterable virus. The disease develops fastest when the air temperature is between 24 and 28 degrees Celsius. This disease occurs in the seedling stage of Chinese cabbage; early cases can be seen as early as when two true leaves have emerged, with the leaves becoming curved and uneven. In severe cases, the leaves will curl up and stop growing. The main transmission routes for this pathogen are the radish aphid and the peach aphid. Aphids carry the virus to healthy plants, and if the climate is suitable, the disease can develop in a matter of hours.

    II. Downy Mildew: Also known as "running horse stem," is a fungal disease. Initially, some white mold appears on the back of the vegetable leaves, and then yellow spots appear on the surface of the leaves. When there are too many yellow spots, the vegetable leaves will wither. Its pathogenic condition is "low temperature and high humidity" - it is most likely to occur when the temperature is between 8 and 16 degrees Celsius. It thrives in humid environments, and the disease occurs most frequently after rain when the temperature drops and it is humid. This disease generally occurs during the rosette and heading stages of Chinese cabbage. Spores often spread through the wind. Once there is a source of infection, it will break out if the climatic conditions are suitable. It often becomes more serious after each rainfall.

    III. Soft Rot: Also known as "rotten lumps," is caused by rod-shaped bacteria entering the tissue of the Chinese cabbage, dissolving the substances connecting cells, causing the cells to separate from each other. When Chinese cabbage is infected with this disease, it rots from the center, and even cabbage that has already formed a head will rot. This disease is most likely to occur in years with excessive rainfall or in low-lying garden fields with poor drainage. Before heading, Chinese cabbage is more resistant to this bacterium; in the later stages of growth, resistance becomes weaker. Therefore, Chinese cabbage is most susceptible to this disease after heading.

    白菜三大病害
    病毒、软腐、霜霉是白菜、萝卜毁灭性的病害。但这些病害，只要我们掌握了它们的发生规律和传染途径，就能有效加以防治。
    一、病毒：又叫孤丁，土名烫发。这种病源是一种过滤性病毒。气温在摄氏二十四度到二十八度时发病最快。这种病发生在白菜的幼苗期，早的往往在抽出两个真叶时，就看到叶子弯曲不平；严重时叶子都卷缩起来，停止生长。这种病源的传播主要途径是，萝卜蚜和桃蚜。蚜虫把病毒带到无病植株上，如果气候适宜，几小时即可发病。
    二、霜霉病：又叫跑马干，是一种真菌性的病害，先是在菜叶背上生出一些白霉，以后叶面上出现黄斑，黄斑过多时菜叶就干枯了。它的发病条件是“低温多湿”——温度在摄氏八到十六度时最容易发生。它最喜欢潮湿环境，在雨后降温、潮湿的情况下，病害发生最盛。这种病一般发生在白菜的莲座期与包心期。孢子常随风飘扬传播，有了病源，只要气候条件适宜，就会大发生。往往下一次雨就严重一次。
    三、软腐病：又叫烂疙瘩，是一种杆状细菌进入白菜组织里，消解了细胞与细胞连结的物质，使细胞互相分离而引起的。白菜生了这种病，便从心部腐烂，已经包好的菜也会腐烂。这种病在雨量过多的年头，或者在排水不良的低洼园田里最容易发生。白菜在卷心以前，对这种病菌的抵抗力要强些；在生长后期，抵抗力却越来越弱。因此，白菜在包头以后最容易发生这种病害。
