Colorful Polish Print Art
		Yang Nawei
    Polish print art is not unfamiliar to Chinese audiences. The recent "Print Exhibition of the People's Republic of Poland" held in Beijing, with its rich content and diverse forms and styles, is even more loved by the majority of Chinese audiences. Through this exhibition, we will not only deepen our understanding of the lives of the Polish people, but also learn about the outstanding achievements of Polish print art. From the works in the exhibition, we have seen the tenacious struggle of the Polish people against the fascist invasion in the past, how the Polish people are working hard to build their socialist motherland today, the Polish people's opposition to the evil wars of imperialism and their firm determination to defend peace, as well as the daily life of the Polish people and the beautiful natural scenery of Poland. All of this has been truly and vividly reflected in the works of Polish printmakers.
    Many of the works in the exhibition are of the kind that, once seen, leave an indelible impression. For example, K. Sopotko's woodcut series "Guerilla Warfare" depicts with angry emotion the brutality and baseness of the German fascist bandits, the ingenious and courageous struggles of the unyielding people in the occupied areas organized together, and the inevitable doom of the invaders. Another series of paintings, "The Insulted People" (by W. Wasilewski), profoundly exposes and accuses the enemy's brutal acts from another angle. The depth of the content and the power of the expression of these works are truly soul-stirring. J. Banek's "Peasants Reading the Manifesto of the Polish Committee of National Liberation in 1944" shows the peasants' support for the new regime; M. Shyshpanska-Neumann's "Warsaw Volunteer Labor Brigade" and K. Shirello's "Bridge Construction Project" show people's enthusiasm for building socialism; F. Bulkevych's "Harvesting Potatoes" shows the working life of peasants. These works have clear and prominent themes and skillful expression techniques, making them unforgettable after seeing them.
    "Wawel Castle" (by S. Ostoya-Khrostovsky), "Before the Storm" (by E. Bartlomiejczyk), "Merchant" (by M. Weiman), "Musician" (by T. Kulisevich)... From these woodcut works, we can see the diversity of styles in Polish print art, sometimes bold and unrestrained, sometimes delicate and exquisite, sometimes decorative, and sometimes naive. Under the expression of certain thematic content, people can obtain different aesthetic enjoyment.
    There are also some satirical paintings in this exhibition. These satirical paintings are pungent and full of humor, ruthlessly exposing the crimes of warmongers, the war essence of American imperialism, and the decay of the capitalist world, strengthening confidence in defending peace. M. Bierman's several photomontages and B. Kalin's many ink paintings are profound in content, and people can understand rich meanings while issuing knowing smiles.
    In short, this is a very rich exhibition, and the above is only a small part of it. However, from these mentioned, it can be clearly seen the close connection between Polish printmakers and their people. Through this exhibition, it will certainly further promote the profound friendship between our two peoples. (Attached picture)

    多彩的波兰版画艺术	杨讷维
    波兰的版画艺术对我国的观众是并不陌生的。最近在北京举办的《波兰人民共和国版画展览会》更以其充实的内容和多种多样的形式风格，为我国的广大观众所喜爱。通过这次展出，不仅会加深我们对波兰人民生活的认识，而且也可以了解到波兰版画艺术的卓越的成就。从展览会的作品中，我们看到了波兰人民在过去的年代中反对法西斯侵略的顽强斗争，看到了波兰人民今天为建设社会主义的祖国怎样辛勤的劳动着，看到了波兰人民反对帝国主义的罪恶战争和坚决保卫和平的决心，也看到了波兰人民的日常的生活和波兰的优美的自然风景。所有这一切，都在波兰版画家们的刀笔下，得到了真实而生动的反映。
    展出中有很多作品都是只要看过一回，就会给人留下难以磨灭的印象。如康·索波特珂的《游击战争》这一组木刻，作者以愤怒的感情刻划了德国法西斯强盗的残暴和卑怯，刻划了敌占区不屈服的人民组织起来所进行的机智而勇敢的各种斗争，也刻划了侵略者必然走向灭亡的下场；另一组画《被侮辱的人们》（瓦·华西科夫斯基作），从另一角度对敌人的残暴行为作了深刻的揭露和控诉。这些作品，其内容的深刻，表现的有力，真是撼人心魄。叶·巴涅克的《1944年阅读波兰民族解放委员会宣言的农民》，表现农民对于新政权的拥护；马·希什潘斯卡—涅乌曼的《华沙义务劳动队》和科·希雷洛的《桥梁建设工程》表现人们的建设社会主义的劳动热情；法·布尔凯维奇的《收获马铃薯》，表现了农民的劳动生活，这些作品，主题鲜明突出，表现技巧圆熟，使人看后难忘。
    《瓦威尔城堡》（斯·奥斯托亚—赫罗斯托夫斯基作）、《暴风雨来临前》（爱·巴尔特罗梅奇克作）、《商人》（麦·魏曼作）、《音乐家》（塔·库里谢维奇作）……从这些木刻作品看，又显示波兰版画艺术风格的多样，或则粗犷豪放，或则细致精美，或富于装饰，或似稚拙，在表现了一定的主题内容之下，使人获得不同的美的享受。
    在这个展览会中，还有一部分讽刺画。这些讽刺画辛辣而富于幽默感。无情地揭露战争贩子的罪行，揭露美帝国主义的战争本质，揭露资本主义世界的腐烂，加强保卫和平的信心。敏·别尔曼的几幅照片剪贴，包·开林的许多幅水墨画，内容都很深刻，在使人发出会心的微笑之间，领略了丰富的意义。
    总之，这是一次很丰富的展出，上面所举的只是小小一部分。然而就从谈到的这些，已可以明显地看到波兰版画家们和他们人民的密切的联系。通过这次展览，也一定会更促进我们两国人民的深厚友谊。（附图片）
