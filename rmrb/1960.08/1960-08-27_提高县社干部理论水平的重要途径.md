    The "Two-Five System" leadership method has been implemented in many parts of the country, and good results have been achieved in various aspects. With the deepening implementation of the "Two-Five System," the trend of cadres going deep into reality and among the masses has become more prevalent in many regions, and a new atmosphere has also emerged in terms of strengthening learning. In Hebei Province and many other places where the "Two-Five System" has been implemented relatively well, more than 90% of the cadres in counties, communes, and management districts are able to concentrate for one to one and a half days of study every seven or ten days. The enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres for learning is constantly rising, and the effectiveness of learning is constantly reflected in practical work. This fully proves that the "Two-Five System" is not only an excellent leadership method, but also an effective method and important way to strengthen the learning of cadres and improve the theoretical and policy levels of the vast number of cadres.
    To rapidly improve the theoretical and policy levels of county, commune, and management district cadres, and to enhance their ability to analyze practical problems so that they can more correctly grasp and implement the Party's guidelines and policies, is a need of the current situation and an urgent demand of the vast number of cadres. All our work is inseparable from the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and the guidance of the Party's guidelines and policies. Under the current new situation, new things are constantly emerging, requiring us to treat them correctly; new contradictions are constantly emerging, requiring us to solve them correctly. This requires even more improvement in the leadership level of cadres. Especially since the implementation of the "Two-Five System," most cadres have gone deep into the front line of production, requiring more solid and meticulous work. In this situation, the requirements for theoretical and policy learning are even higher. After each cadre goes deep down, in order to truly discover important problems, conduct correct analysis, and solve them correctly in accordance with the Party's policies; in order to truly summarize the experiences created by the masses and use them to promote work, it is essential to strive to improve one's own theoretical level and policy level. Only by mastering the weapon of theory, taking Marxism-Leninism as one's guide to action, and deeply understanding the essence of the Party's guidelines and policies, can things be done well, can "muddled battles" be avoided, and can major errors in work be prevented. Experience tells us that the deepening and improvement of work are mutually coordinated and interact with each other. The more you go deep, the more you need to improve, otherwise you cannot correctly discover and solve problems after going deep; the more you need to improve, the more you need to go deep into reality and among the masses, otherwise it will be closed-door improvement, and theory will be divorced from practice. In fact, in the process of implementing the "Two-Five System," in places where the study of cadres has been strengthened and the theoretical and policy levels of cadres have been improved, the cadres there are more clear-headed and bright-eyed when going deep into work, enhancing their consciousness and initiative, and discovering and solving problems more timely, accurately, and effectively.
    To solve the problem of linking theory with practice well is the purpose of learning and also the correct learning method. The implementation of the "Two-Five System" has created more favorable conditions for cadres to link theory with practice in their learning. In regions where the "Two-Five System" has been implemented relatively well, the main reason why theoretical learning is done well is not only because the learning system is truly adhered to, but mainly because the principle of linking theory with practice is adhered to. The "three-combination of theory, policy, and practice" method implemented in some places in Hebei Province is a valuable experience in linking theory with practice and combining learning with application.
    Generally, county and commune cadres lack the habit of theoretical learning, and they have a mysterious view of theoretical learning that is too high to reach, and varying degrees of fear of difficulty. Therefore, when starting to implement the "Two-Five System" and starting formal learning, it is very important as a first step to pay attention to selecting appropriate learning documents that cadres can easily understand and easily combine with current practical work. In general, counties in Hebei Province began to study Mao Zedong's "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and other documents, and conducted easy-to-understand explanations that combined theory with practice. In addition to emphasizing studying the documents word by word and sentence by sentence, and paying attention to understanding the essence of the documents, it was also emphasized to link with the current reality, both to understand the documents more deeply and to learn to use the "arrow" of Marxism-Leninism to shoot the "target" of the current actual struggle in the local area. In order to better combine theoretical learning with the current actual struggle, some commune party committees first carefully studied the main problems in the current actual work and the ideological aspects of cadres in the local area based on the learning content of each time, and clarified the key points and materials for linking theory with practice. When tutoring cadres, on the one hand, the principles can be explained more deeply by linking with practical problems, and on the other hand, it is also convenient to guide everyone to link with reality more appropriately and improve ideological understanding during group discussions. In some places, during the two days of implementing the "Two-Five System," the first day is for learning, and the second day is for meetings to summarize and deploy work. The leading comrades pay attention to guiding everyone to apply the theoretical viewpoints and policy principles they have learned well. In this way, everyone can be helped and inspired to raise some practical problems to the level of theory and policy for understanding, so that cadres can stand higher and see further when analyzing and observing problems. When studying "On Contradiction," cadres in the county-level organs and various communes in Ningjin County closely focused on the current drought resistance struggle and launched a broad activity of "learning, finding, and solving" the main contradictions throughout the county. As a result, many large and small contradictory problems in the drought resistance struggle were discovered and properly resolved under the leadership of everyone in finding and solving the main contradictions, thereby powerfully promoting the drought resistance movement throughout the county. The cadres of the county's Commercial Bureau, using the viewpoint of "On Contradiction," grasped the main contradiction that more than 60% of the production teams lacked parts for agricultural machinery at that time. Therefore, leading cadres took the lead and used the spirit of annihilation to solve the problem in every possible way, so that most of the machinery that had been stopped was put into operation. This shows that once theory is well combined with practice, it will definitely produce a huge guiding role and material force.
    Marxist-Leninist theory is the guiding ideology for formulating all our guidelines and policies. All the guidelines and policies of our Party are rich in profound theoretical significance and are the embodiment of creatively applying the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to handle major issues in our country. Many places have achieved remarkable results in combining theoretical learning with current guidelines and policies when implementing the "Two-Five System" and strengthening theoretical learning. County and commune cadres are the direct executors of the Party's guidelines and policies. Their policy concepts and their familiarity with the Party's policies are directly related to whether each policy can be correctly implemented. One of the important purposes of organizing these cadres for theoretical learning should also be to improve their level of understanding of the Party's guidelines and policies, to help cadres understand the essence of the Party's guidelines and policies to the height of theoretical principles, to make cadres know the ins and outs of each policy, and to understand why they should do this and not do that; or why they must do this at this time and place, but must do that at that time and place, and so on. In this way, we can learn the standpoints, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism, constantly improve our ideological level and analytical ability, and enhance our consciousness of implementing the Party's guidelines and policies. On the one hand, we can resolutely implement the Party's guidelines and policies, and on the other hand, we can wage irreconcilable struggles against behaviors that violate the Party's guidelines and policies. Hebei Province and many other places have also achieved remarkable results in learning Mao Zedong's "On Contradiction" in conjunction with learning the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation" and the current policies of giving priority to agricultural production proposed by Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee. Not only has it made cadres more deeply appreciate the importance of correctly understanding the main contradictions, but it has also theoretically recognized the correctness of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and the current policies of giving priority to agricultural production.
    To promote the style of summarizing experience and to write articles summarizing experience is a good way to link theory with practice and combine learning with application. In which region this is done, the atmosphere of cadre learning will certainly be strong, and new improvements will continue to appear in the work. Constantly launching cadres to apply theory to summarize experience can more effectively improve cadres' analytical ability and leadership level. Since Wuqiao County implemented the "Two-Five System," it has gradually corrected the problem of "many documents and reports, but few summaries of experience." In more than four months, it has summarized nearly 200 important experiences, so that various advanced experiences in the county can be affirmed, consolidated, promoted, and improved in a timely manner. Tang County's county and commune cadres advocated the "four-combination of learning, doing, researching, and writing" in their studies. Secretaries took the lead, the whole party began to write, and wrote articles summarizing experience. The ten secretaries of the county party committee took the lead in learning theory, and everyone wrote articles. From February to May this year, they wrote more than 30 papers that combined theory with practice, more than 20 of which have been published in the central, provincial, and municipal party newspapers or journals. This fully reflects the improved level of cadres in this county.
    In many other places, since the implementation of the "Two-Five System," there have also been experiences similar to the "three-combination of theory, policy, and practice" in Hebei Province. Of course, there must be a process to achieve this, but as long as it is clarified ideologically, this style can definitely be cultivated and this habit can be developed.
    Experience proves that if the vast number of cadres are to learn well and rapidly improve their theoretical and policy levels, the key lies in the fact that party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over cadre learning. Since the implementation of the "Two-Five System," the party organizations in many places have paid more attention to the leadership of cadre learning than before, and have grasped learning as an important content in arranging, inspecting, and summarizing work, just as they grasp work. In many regions, when each party committee secretary is assigned to a specific area, they are responsible for leading production work and also for leading cadre learning. Many communes and management districts have also clearly designated a secretary to take charge, to grasp the learning situation of cadres, to study the problems in learning, to summarize learning experience, and to promote the development of the learning movement. When cadres are concentrated for learning, some party committee secretaries also preside over the cadres' learning like presiding over a "small training class," and personally conduct tutoring, which greatly stimulates the cadres' enthusiasm for learning and improves the learning effect.
    To do a good job in cadre learning, it is necessary to conscientiously adhere to the learning system formed since the implementation of the "Two-Five System." It is necessary to cultivate the consciousness of learning among cadres and create an atmosphere of conscientious learning. This is an important guarantee for achieving learning results. The leadership should make comprehensive and reasonable arrangements for cadres' work, labor, and learning, so that cadres can truly go down and up, go down to work seriously and deeply, discover problems and solve problems effectively, and come up to study seriously, study policies, and improve theoretical and policy levels effectively. And it is necessary to implement "alignment between upper and lower levels and unity between left and right" between upper and lower levels and between various departments at the same level, to ensure from the organization and time that cadres can adhere to the learning system, avoid mutual conflict, or squeeze out learning time. At the same time, before cadres are concentrated for learning, they should try to complete those things that need to be done and can be completed, and make practical arrangements for the work that needs to be arranged; when concentrated for learning, it is also necessary to leave a few cadres to take turns on duty, to take charge of the general temporary affairs that occur on "learning days." This can ensure that most cadres concentrate on learning. At the same time, it is also necessary to pay attention to "grasping both ends and leading the middle," and to commend those comrades who study well in a timely manner, and mobilize everyone to learn from them. Special attention should be paid to helping those comrades with lower cultural levels, less interest in learning, and particularly busy work, constantly improving their interest in learning, so that they can more consciously adhere to learning.
    The main cadres of county, commune, and management district party committees and various departments must set an example and study well first. The fact that these comrades can study well is of great significance for leading everyone to study and for promoting practical work. All localities should universally establish models of leading cadres who take the lead in learning well and helping everyone to learn well. All our cadres must gradually reach the requirements of "red and expert," and "versatile in both literary and military skills," and become not only politicians, but also experts in production. The backbone force in the Party's cadre ranks should have a higher theoretical level, policy level, and professional level. As the saying goes, "One elite soldier is worth a lot, and a group of elite generals is worth even more." The improvement of main cadres is not only a need for doing their own work well, but also related to leading everyone to improve and move forward together. Therefore, these cadres should not only set an example in going deep into work, but also become models in learning. They should not only "travel ten thousand miles" and be courageous in practice, but also "read ten thousand books" and be diligent in learning. Of course, the burden on these cadres is heavier than that of ordinary comrades, but precisely because of this, they should learn better and strive to improve themselves.
    The implementation of the "Two-Five System" has created good conditions for strengthening the learning of cadres below the county level. The cadre learning in many places is being pushed to a new climax. Party committees in all localities should, in the process of deeply implementing the "Two-Five System," grasp both participation in production and leadership in production, and also grasp learning theory and learning policies, grasp both going deep and grasping improvement, and strive to make cadres at all levels gradually improve and mature, so as to run the people's communes better and run all socialist construction undertakings better.

    提高县社干部理论水平的重要途径
    全国许多地方，自从推行“二五制”的领导方法以来，已经在各个方面取得了良好的效果。随着“二五制”的深入推行，广大干部深入实际、深入群众，在好些地区已经成为更普遍的风气，并且在加强学习方面，也出现了新的气象。河北省和其他许多推行“二五制”较好的地方，县、公社、管理区都有90％以上的干部，能够在每七天或每十天内，集中起来坚持进行一天到一天半的学习。广大干部的学习热情正在不断高涨，学习的效果正在不断地从实际工作上反映出来。这充分证明，“二五制”不只是一种优良的领导方法，同时也是加强干部的学习、提高广大干部理论水平和政策水平的有效方法和重要途径。
    迅速提高县、公社、管理区干部的理论水平和政策水平，提高他们对实际问题的分析能力，使他们能够更正确地掌握和执行党的方针政策，这是当前形势发展的需要，也是广大干部的迫切要求。我们进行各项工作，都离不开马克思列宁主义的指导，离不开党的方针政策的指导。在当前的新形势下，不断出现的新事物，要求我们去正确对待；不断出现的新矛盾，要求我们去正确解决，这就更加需要提高干部的领导水平。特别是推行“二五制”以来，大多数干部深入到生产第一线去，要求工作作得更扎实，更细致。在这种情况下，理论和政策学习的要求也就更高了。每个干部深入下去以后，要真正能够发现重要的问题，能够进行正确分析，并且按照党的政策去正确地解决；要真正把群众创造的经验很好地总结起来，拿了去推动工作，就非努力提高自己的理论水平和政策水平不可。只有掌握理论武器，以马克思列宁主义作为自己的行动指南，深刻领会党的方针政策的精神实质，才能把事情办好，才可以避免打“糊涂仗”，防止在工作中发生重大错误。经验告诉我们，工作的深入和提高，是相互配合、互为作用的。越深入越要提高，不然深入下去以后也不能正确地发现问题和解决问题；越要提高越需要深入实际深入群众，不然就是关门提高、理论和实际脱节。事实上，在推行“二五制”的过程中，凡是加强了干部学习，提高了干部的理论和政策水平的地方，那里的干部在深入工作的时候，就更加心明眼亮，增强了自觉性和主动性，发现问题和解决问题就更及时更准确更切实。
    很好地解决理论联系实际的问题，是学习的目的，也是正确的学习方法。“二五制”的推行，为干部在学习方面做到理论联系实际创造了更有利的条件。在推行“二五制”比较好的地区，理论学习搞得好的主要原因不只是真正坚持了学习制度，主要是坚持了理论联系实际的方针。河北省在好些地方实行的“理论、政策、实际三结合”的办法，就是理论联系实际、学用结合的一条宝贵经验。
    一般县社干部缺乏理论学习的习惯，对于理论学习存在高不可攀的神秘观点和程度不同的畏难情绪，因此在开始推行“二五制”、开始进行正规学习的时候，注意选择适当的学习文件，使干部容易学懂、容易和当前实际工作结合，是十分重要的第一步。河北省各县一般开始学习毛泽东同志的“矛盾论”、“实践论”和“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”等文件，而且进行了理论联系实际的、通俗易懂的讲解，除了强调逐字逐句地学通文件，注意领会文件的精神实质以外，还强调联系当前实际，既为了更深刻地了解文件，又为了学会运用马克思列宁主义之“矢”，去射当地当前实际斗争之“的”。有些公社党委为了使理论学习更好地与当前实际斗争结合，在每次集中进行学习以前，党委的学习核心小组，就首先根据各次的学习内容，认真研究当地当前实际工作中和干部思想方面的主要问题，从中明确理论联系实际的要点和材料。在对干部进行辅导时，一方面可以联系实际问题把道理讲得更深透，另方面也便于引导大家在小组讨论时能够比较恰当地去联系实际，提高思想认识。有的地方，在执行“二五制”的两天当中，第一天学习，第二天开会总结和部署工作，领导同志便注意引导大家把学到的理论观点和政策原则，很好地应用起来。这样就可以帮助和启发大家把一些实际问题提到理论上、政策上去认识，就可以使干部在分析和观察问题时，站得更高，看得更远。宁津县县级机关和各个公社的干部，在学习“矛盾论”的时候，就紧紧围绕着当前的抗旱斗争，在全县范围内展开了一个“学、找、解”主要矛盾的广泛活动。结果，抗旱斗争中许许多多大大小小的矛盾问题，在大家寻找和解决主要矛盾的带动下，被发现出来，得到了适当的解决，从而有力地推动了全县的抗旱运动。这个县商业局的干部，应用“矛盾论”的观点，抓住了当时有60％以上的生产队农业机械缺乏零件这个主要矛盾，于是领导干部带头出马，用打歼灭仗的突击精神，千方百计地解决了这个问题，使大部分原来停着的机械都开动起来。这说明，理论一经很好地同实际结合起来，就一定会产生出巨大的指导作用和物质力量。
    马克思列宁主义的理论是我们制订一切方针政策的指导思想，我们党所有的方针政策都富有深刻的理论意义，都是创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理来处理我国各项重大问题的体现。好些地方在实行“二五制”、加强理论学习的时候，结合当前方针政策来学习理论，取得了显著的效果。县社干部是党的方针政策的直接执行者，他们的政策观念如何，他们对党的政策的熟悉程度如何，都直接关系着每一项政策能不能正确地贯彻执行。组织这些干部进行理论学习，重要目的之一，也应当是提高他们对于党的方针政策的理解水平，帮助干部能够提到理论原则的高度来领会党的方针政策的精神实质，使干部知道每一项政策的来龙去脉，懂得为什么应当这样做而不应当那样去做；或者在此时此地必须这样做，在彼时彼地却又必须那样去做，等等。这样来学习马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法，不断提高自己的思想水平和分析能力，增强他们执行党的方针政策的自觉性，一方面自己能坚决执行党的方针政策，一方面能同违反党的方针政策的行为作不调和的斗争。河北省和好些地方在学习毛泽东同志的“矛盾论”时，结合学习毛泽东同志和党中央提出的“以农业为基础”的方针和当前把农业生产放在首要地位的各项政策，也得到显著的效果。不只是使干部更深刻地体会到正确认识主要矛盾的重要意义，而且也从理论上认识到以农业为基础的方针和当前把农业生产放在首要地位的各项政策的正确性。
    大兴总结经验之风，大写总结经验的文章，这是理论联系实际、学用结合的一种好办法。哪个地区这样作了，哪里干部学习的风气就一定旺盛，工作就会不断出现新的起色。不断地发动干部应用理论去总结经验，就可以更有效地提高干部的分析能力和领导水平。吴桥县实行“二五制”以来，逐步纠正了“文件表报多、经验总结少”的毛病，四个多月内总结了各种重要经验近两百条，使全县各项先进经验能够得到及时肯定、及时巩固、及时推广和及时提高。唐县县社干部在学习时提倡了“学、做、研、写四结合”。书记带头，全党动笔，大写总结经验的文章。县委十位书记，带头学理论，人人写文章，今年2月到5月就写出了三十多篇理论联系实际的论文，其中有二十多篇已经发表在中央、省、市的党报或党刊上，这就充分反映出这个县的干部的水平提高了。
    在其他许多地方，推行“二五制”以来，也有着与河北省这种“理论、政策、实际三结合”相类似的经验。自然，做到这一点总得有一个过程，但是，只要从思想上明确起来，就一定能够培养起这种作风，养成这种习惯。
    经验证明，广大干部要能学习得好，迅速地提高理论和政策水平，关键在于各级党委对干部学习必须加强领导。推行“二五制”以来，许多地方的党组织对干部学习的领导比以往更加注意，像抓工作一样地去抓学习，在布置、检查和总结工作的时候，都把学习问题作为一项重要的内容。好些地区每个党委书记分工包片时，包领导生产工作，也包领导干部学习。很多公社、管理区也都明确由一名书记挂帅，掌握干部学习情况，研究学习中的问题，总结学习经验，推动学习运动的开展。有些党委书记在干部集中进行学习的时候，还像主持一个“小训练班”一样，主持干部的学习，并且亲自进行辅导，这样便大大激发起干部的学习热情，提高学习效果。
    要搞好干部学习，必须认真坚持推行“二五制”以来形成的学习制度。要在干部中培养学习的自觉性，造成一种认真学习的风气。这是取得学习成绩的重要保证。领导上对干部的工作、劳动和学习要进行全面的合理的安排，使干部真正能够有下有上，下去时能够认真深入工作，切实地发现问题，解决问题，上来时能够认真学习，研究政策，切实地提高理论和政策水平。并且要在上下级之间和同级各部门之间实行“上下对口、左右统一”，从组织上、时间上保证干部能够坚持学习制度，避免互相冲撞，或者把学习时间挤掉。同时，在干部集中上来进行学习以前，要尽量把那些需要办也可以办完的事情办完，并且对需要安排的工作切实作好安排；当集中进行学习的时候，还需要留出少数干部轮流值班工作，把在“学习日”所发生的一般临时事务担当起来。这样才能保证大多数干部集中精力学习。同时，也要注意“抓两头、带中间”，及时表扬那些学习好的同志，动员大家向他们看齐。要特别注意帮助那些文化水平较低、学习兴趣较差和工作特别繁忙的同志，不断提高他们的学习兴趣，使他们能够更自觉地坚持学习。
    县、公社、管理区党委和各个部门的主要干部，一定要以身作则，首先学好。这些同志能够学习得好，对于带动大家的学习有重要的意义，对于促进实际工作也有着重大的意义。各地应当普遍树立主要干部带头学得好、又帮助大家学好的标兵。我们所有干部都要逐步达到“红透专深”、“文武全才”的要求，既是政治家，也成为生产的内行。党的干部队伍中的骨干力量，应当具有更高的理论水平、政策水平和业务水平。俗话说：“兵精精一个，将精精一群”，主要干部的提高，不只是自己做好工作的需要，也关系着率领大家共同提高、共同前进。因此，这些干部不只是要在深入工作方面作表率，在学习方面也应当成为模范。不只要“走万里路”，勇于实践，而且还要“读万卷书”，勤于学习。诚然，这部分干部肩上的担子比一般同志更重些，但是，正因为这样，他们就应当学习得更好，千方百计提高自己。
    “二五制”的推行为加强县以下干部的学习造成了良好的条件，许多地方的干部学习正在推向新的高潮，各地党委要在深入推行“二五制”的过程中，既抓好参加生产领导生产，又抓好学习理论学习政策，既抓好深入，又抓好提高，努力使各级干部逐渐地提高起来和成熟起来，从而把人民公社办得更好，把各项社会主义建设事业办得更好。
