Xinhua News Agency, 1st August dispatch: The Swiss Ambassador to China, Mr. Naville, held a reception this afternoon to celebrate the National Day of the Swiss Confederation.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Xi Zhongxun, and others attended the reception.

Premier Zhou spoke at the reception, warmly congratulating the National Day of the Swiss Confederation. He said: Switzerland is a peaceful and neutral country, a country that has contributed to the maintenance of world peace. Switzerland, along with Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden, participated in the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, playing a significant role in ensuring peace in Korea and the Far East. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Your Excellency the Ambassador, and through the Ambassador to the Swiss Federal Government and the people.

Premier Zhou said: The diplomatic relationship between Switzerland and China has been established for a long time. It can be said that the relationship between China and Switzerland is an example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Some Western public opinions are now provoking and saying that China has abandoned the policy of peaceful coexistence with countries of different social systems, which is a slander. China and Burma and Nepal have signed treaties of friendship and mutual non-aggression and treaties of peace and friendship respectively, and we have also resolved the border issues with these two countries very well. We also have good relations with many Asian countries, such as Afghanistan, Ceylon, and Cambodia. We also strive for peaceful coexistence with other Asian countries, such as India and Indonesia. We are not only willing to achieve peaceful coexistence with Asian countries and Arab countries, but also with European countries and countries in other regions of the world.

Premier Zhou pointed out that there are still aggressive military blocs in the world, such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which is hostile to and surrounds China in the East. China firmly opposes this kind of encirclement. However, this does not mean abandoning the effort to achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. We propose that all countries along the Asian and Pacific coasts, including the United States, sign a treaty of mutual non-aggression and peace, and build this entire region into a zone free of nuclear weapons. This is certainly a long-term goal, but we will make unremitting efforts to achieve it.

Vice Premier Chen Yi also spoke at the reception. He expressed congratulations to the Swiss Federal Government and the Swiss people on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people. He said: We are pleased to see that Switzerland, as a neutral country, has made continuous efforts to ease international tensions.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: We Chinese people love peace. As Your Excellency the Ambassador has seen, the Chinese people are making tremendous efforts to build socialism and quickly get rid of economic backwardness. We need a long-term international peaceful environment and have made unremitting efforts to ease international tensions and safeguard world peace. Any honest person can see the Chinese people's sincere desire for peace.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: Precisely because our two governments and peoples share the common desire to ease international tensions and promote world peace, the friendly relations between our two countries have continued to develop and consolidate. We believe that this friendly relationship will be further developed and consolidated.

At the beginning of the reception, Ambassador Naville spoke. He said: "Today, the Swiss Confederation celebrates the six hundred and sixty-ninth anniversary of the founding of the Federation. Switzerland, the seat of the International Red Cross and many international organizations, continues to pursue an active policy of neutrality and economic, technical, and humanitarian mutual assistance. It is very pleased to be able to hold all international conferences aimed at seeking peace and the peaceful resolution of disputes between countries on its territory."

The Ambassador said: "Switzerland and China have always maintained friendly relations, and I hope that this friendly relationship will continue to develop in the future. I have been in China for more than a year, and during this period, I have seen the great cause that the Chinese people are engaged in to develop their economy and improve their technical and cultural level. With the help of the Chinese authorities, I have visited many industrial and agricultural facilities, social, health and cultural and educational facilities. I have seen the great efforts made by the Chinese people to achieve this goal."

Among those present at the reception were Vice Foreign Minister Luo Guibo and people from all walks of life in China. Envoys from various countries to China also attended the reception.

    周总理陈毅副总理在瑞士大使国庆招待会上说
    中国愿同各国和平共处维护世界和平
    主张亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约
    宾主表示相信中瑞两国之间的友好关系将得到进一步的发展和巩固
    新华社1日讯　瑞士驻中国大使纳维义今天下午举行招待会，庆祝瑞士联邦国庆日。
    周恩来总理，陈毅、习仲勋副总理等出席了招待会。
    周总理在招待会上讲话，热烈祝贺瑞士联邦国庆日。他说：瑞士是一个和平中立的国家，是一个对维护世界和平有贡献的国家。瑞士和波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典一起参加了朝鲜中立国监察委员会的工作，对保障朝鲜和远东的和平起了很大的作用。我愿借此机会向大使阁下，并通过大使向瑞士联邦政府和人民表示感谢。
    周总理说：瑞士和中国的外交关系已经建立了很久。可以说，中国和瑞士的关系是不同社会制度国家可以和平共处的一个例子。现在有些西方舆论挑拨说，中国放弃了不同社会制度的国家和平共处的政策，这是诬蔑。中国和缅甸、尼泊尔分别签订了友好互不侵犯条约和和平友好条约，我们同这两个国家的边界问题也解决得很好。我们同很多亚洲国家，例如阿富汗、锡兰、柬埔寨，也有很好的关系。我们同其他的亚洲国家，例如印度和印度尼西亚，也力求和平共处。我们不仅愿意同亚洲国家、阿拉伯国家，实现和平共处，而且也愿意同欧洲国家以及世界其他地区的国家，实现和平共处。
    周总理指出，现在世界上还存在着侵略性的军事集团，例如在东方就有敌视和包围中国的东南亚条约组织，中国坚决反对这种包围。但是，并不因此而放弃争取实现不同社会制度的国家之间的和平共处。我们主张亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内，签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约，把这整个地区建成为没有核武器的地区。这当然是一个长期努力的方向，但是，我们将为此作不懈的努力。
    陈毅副总理也在招待会上讲话。他代表中国政府和中国人民向瑞士联邦政府和瑞士人民表示祝贺。他说：我们高兴地看到，作为中立国的瑞士，为和缓国际紧张局势不断作出的努力。
    陈毅副总理说：我们中国人民热爱和平。正如大使阁下所看到的，中国人民正在为建设社会主义和迅速摆脱经济上的落后状态而进行巨大的努力。我们需要一个长期的国际和平环境，并且为和缓国际紧张局势和保障世界和平作了不懈的努力。任何正直的人都可以看到中国人民对和平的真诚愿望。
    陈毅副总理说：正因为我们两国政府和人民都有着和缓国际紧张局势和促进世界和平的共同愿望，我们两国之间的友好关系不断发展和巩固。我们相信，这种友好关系将得到进一步的发展和巩固。
    在招待会开始的时候，纳维义大使讲了话。他说：“今天瑞士联邦庆祝联邦成立六百六十九周年。瑞士，这个国际红十字会和许多国际组织的所在地，今天继续执行积极的中立政策和经济、技术及人道的互助政策。它很高兴能够在自己的国土上举行一切旨在寻求和平及和平解决各国间纠纷的国际会议。”
    大使说：“瑞中两国一直保持着友好关系，我希望这种友好关系在将来继续不断地发展。我来到中国已经有一年多的时间，在这个期间，我看到中国人民为发展本国经济和提高技术文化水平所从事的伟大事业。由于中国当局的帮助，我曾参观了许多工业和农业设施，社会、卫生和文教设施。我看到了中国人民为达到这一目的所作的巨大努力。”
    出席招待会的，还有外交部副部长罗贵波和中国各方面的人士。各国驻中国的使节也出席了招待会。
