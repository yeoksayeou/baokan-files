Medical personnel combine with the broad masses to actively control diseases
Tianjin and Shanghai Wangjia Wharf launch mass movements for planned disease prevention and treatment

    (Our report) Tianjin is vigorously carrying out mass movements for planned disease prevention and treatment, making disease elimination work more widespread and thorough.
    Planned prevention and treatment, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, combines medical personnel with the broad masses, adopting comprehensive measures to systematically and gradually control and eliminate major diseases that endanger people's health in batches and phases. The focus of the first stage of planned prevention and treatment is to conduct a general survey of the health status of all the city's people. Through close cooperation between medical personnel and the masses, the health status of more than three million people was surveyed in just one month, basically clarifying the prevalence of various diseases and formulating plans for planned prevention and treatment. Districts, factories, and communes have also formulated prevention and treatment plans based on their specific circumstances. The second stage of planned prevention and treatment is to carry out a "Five Diseases Prevention Movement" (hepatitis, dysentery, measles, diphtheria, influenza) centered on hepatitis and dysentery throughout the city.
    In implementing planned prevention and treatment citywide, hospitals are used as centers to divide the city into twenty-seven prevention and treatment zones, unifying the organization of medical forces to rationally arrange the technical strength of hospitals, health centers, and health stations. Medical institutions throughout the city implemented a graded, divisional, and regionally responsible system. Each commune has a central hospital, with hospital departments assigned to specific areas, and each point in the commune has a responsible physician. In areas with stronger medical resources, hospitals are responsible across districts. Collaboration is also promoted between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and between specialized hospitals and general hospitals, adopting comprehensive prevention and treatment measures. The second is to mobilize the masses, actively cultivate health backbones, and vigorously train mass health workers. Since the beginning of this year, the city has trained more than 3,000 Red Cross medical personnel, more than 400,000 Red Cross health workers, and a large number of epidemic reporting personnel and home care workers. At the same time, medical personnel are organized to impart health knowledge to the masses, teaching them the prevention and treatment knowledge of several common diseases, making disease prevention a common task for medical personnel and the masses. In planned prevention and treatment, the masses have created many methods for eliminating pests and diseases. Many factories, in light of their specific circumstances, have launched "disease-free health competitions." Hongqiao District promoted "family medicine kits" throughout the district, achieving early prevention and early treatment of diseases. Each prevention and treatment zone conducted physical examinations and hygiene training for cooks and childcare workers in urban people's communes, assisting them in establishing health systems.
    Since the implementation of planned prevention and treatment citywide, health work has shifted from passively treating diseases to actively preventing them. More than 85% of the city's medical personnel have left the hospitals and are taking turns going deep into the streets, factories, and grassroots health personnel, Red Cross medical personnel, and health workers to actively prevent and treat diseases. Through planned prevention and treatment, a relatively complete medical and health care network has emerged throughout the city. Hospitals have established health departments, grassroots units have established health stations, and medical personnel and the masses are jointly fighting diseases. Some areas have implemented a "six guarantees and six protections" contract system, with medical personnel guaranteeing health care work, prevention and treatment of diseases, etc.; the masses guarantee environmental sanitation, personal hygiene, and timely reporting of patients, thus tightly controlling the occurrence and spread of diseases. At the same time, specialized technical research groups for preventing mercury poisoning, lead poisoning, silicosis, as well as preventing and treating hepatitis and tuberculosis, have been established throughout the city to focus on studying prevention and treatment measures for various occupational diseases and infectious diseases.
    Planned prevention and treatment has promoted the health of workers and masses, ensuring the continuous leap forward in production. Through planned prevention and treatment, the incidence of disease and absenteeism due to illness among workers and staff in factories and enterprises throughout the city have generally decreased. After Hexi District launched planned prevention and treatment, the attendance rate of workers in various factories increased compared to before.

    (Our report) The Wangjia Wharf area of ​​the Nanshi District of Shanghai, under the leadership of the Party Committee, actively implements the policy of "prevention first" in health work, relying on the masses to vigorously carry out planned prevention and treatment work, so as to achieve early treatment of diseases and early prevention of diseases when there are no diseases.
    The biggest feature of the planned prevention and treatment carried out in this area is: relying on the masses, based on the establishment of a health care network and the training of health backbones, to carry out national physical examinations, general surveys and treatments. At present, there are district hospitals in this area, and the seven neighborhood committees also have their own health stations, and there are Red Cross health stations at the grassroots level. This health care network has more than 10,000 Red Cross members who have received certain training, nearly 1,000 health workers and health workers, most of whom are able to handle general diseases and have small trauma dressing skills. They are active in 70 factories and nearly 100 canteens, nurseries, production teams and residential areas in the area, protecting the health of the people. In the general survey, the broad masses of people and medical staff were united as one, conducting surveys, treatments, propaganda and popularizing health knowledge, truly forming a mass movement. At present, the general survey in this area has been completed by 90%, and on this basis, health household registration books and one card per person under the age of eight have been established. Through disease screening and investigation, the condition is actively grasped, and there is a relatively comprehensive understanding of the health status of residents in the area. In this way, not only is there a clear understanding of how many infectious disease patients and chronic disease patients there are, but they are all included in the prevention and treatment plan, and they are controlled and treated in batches and phases according to the severity and urgency of the disease. First, we will encircle and suppress diseases that are most harmful to health and affect production. Major infectious diseases such as hepatitis and dysentery have been brought under control, hookworm disease, schistosomiasis, filariasis, malaria and other "four diseases" have been eliminated, and trachoma has also been completely cured.

    医务人员同广大群众结合主动控制疾病
    天津、上海王家码头开展有计划防治疾病的群众运动
    本报讯　天津市大力开展有计划防治疾病的群众运动，使除害灭病工作更加普遍和深入。
    计划防治是在各级党委的领导下，医务人员与广大群众相结合，采取综合措施，有组织、有计划地分批分期逐步控制和消灭危害人民健康的主要疾病。计划防治第一阶段的工作中心是对全市人民健康状况进行普查。经过医务人员与群众紧密合作，只用了一个月的时间就普查了三百多万人的健康状况，基本摸清了各种疾病的患病率，并制订了计划防治的规划。各区、各工厂、各公社也都根据具体情况分别制订了防治计划。计划防治的第二阶段，是在全市开展以肝炎、痢疾为中心的防五病运动（肝炎、痢疾、痳疹、白喉、流行性感冒）。
    全市在实行计划防治工作中，以医院为中心把全市划分为二十七个防治区，统一组织医疗力量，使医院、卫生院、保健站的技术力量得到合理安排。全市医疗机构实行了分级分工分地区负责制，各公社都设有中心医院，医院的科室分工包片，公社的各点也都有责任医师。医疗力量较强的地区，实行医院跨区负责。在中西医之间、专科医院与综合医院之间也大兴协作，采取综合防治措施。其次是发动群众，积极培养卫生骨干，大力训练群众卫生员。今年以来，全市培训了红十字医士三千多名，培训了红十字卫生员四十多万名，还培养了大批的疫情报告员、家庭护理员等。同时组织医务人员向群众传授卫生知识，将几种多发病的防治知识，教给群众，使防病除害成为医务人员与群众的共同任务。在计划防治中，群众创造了很多除害灭病的办法。许多工厂结合具体情况，开展了“无病健康赛”，红桥区在全区推行了“家庭药箱”，作到了有病早防早治。各防治区对城市人民公社的炊事员、保育员普遍进行了体格检查和卫生训练，协助他们建立了卫生制度。
    全市实行计划防治以来，使卫生工作，从被动的消极治病，改变为主动的防病。全市有85％以上的医务人员走出医院，轮流深入街道、工厂与基层卫生人员、红十字医士、卫生员一起主动防治疾病。通过计划防治，全市已出现了一个比较完整的医疗保健网。各医院都设立了保健科，基层单位建立了保健站，医务人员与群众共同与疾病进行斗争。有的地区实行了“六包六保”的合同制，医务人员包卫生保健工作、包预防和医疗疾病等；群众保证环境卫生、个人卫生，发现病人及时报告，这样就较严密地控制了疾病的发生和流行。同时在全市建立起防汞中毒、防铅中毒、防矽肺中毒，以及防治肝炎、肺结核等专业技术研究小组，集中研究各种职业病和传染病的防治措施。
    计划防治促进了职工群众的身体健康，保证了生产的持续跃进。通过计划防治，全市各工厂、企业职工的发病率和因病缺勤率普遍下降。河西区开展计划防治以后，各工厂职工的出勤率比以前提高了。
    本报讯　上海市南市区王家码头地区，在党委领导下，积极贯彻卫生工作以“预防为主”的方针，依靠群众大搞计划防治工作，做到有病早治，无病早防。
    这个地区开展计划防治的最大特点是：依靠群众，在建立保健网和训练卫生骨干的基础上，进行全民性的体格检查，普查普治。目前，这里的地段有地段医院，七个里弄委员会也都有自己的卫生保健站，基层还有红十字卫生站。这一保健网拥有一万多个受过一定训练的红十字会会员，近千个保健员与卫生员，其中大部分已能处理一般疾病和具有小外伤包扎技术。他们活跃在地区内七十家工厂和近百个食堂、托儿所、生产组和居民点里，保卫着人民的健康。在普查中，广大群众与医务人员打成一片，边查、边治、边宣传和普及卫生知识，真正形成了一个群众性的运动。目前，这个地区的普查工作已完成了90％，并在这一基础上建立了卫生户口册和八岁以下儿童的一人一卡制。通过疾病排队摸底，主动掌握病情，对地区居民的健康情况，有了比较全面的了解。这样，不但做到对有多少个传染病人和慢性病人，心中有数，并且都纳入防治计划之内，根据病情的轻重缓急，分期分批地加以控制和治疗。首先对危害健康和影响生产最大的疾病，进行围剿。主要传染病如肝炎、痢疾等已得到了控制，钩虫病、血吸虫病、丝虫病、疟疾等“四病”已经消灭了，砂眼也已经全部治愈。
