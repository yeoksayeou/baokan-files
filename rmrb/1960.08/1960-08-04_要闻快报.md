　　Expanding Steel Varieties

　　Changchun city steel plants have adopted many measures to increase the variety of steel products while maintaining high production. For example, the rolling mill workers of Changchun Steel Plant carried out a series of transformations to the original equipment, creating a continuous rolling production line, and promoted the advanced experience of "enclosure layout" in rolling. Since July, the city has developed from being able to produce only a single variety of wire to being able to produce six kinds of steel products, including square steel, strip steel, wire, light rail, and fishplates.

　　Fully Utilizing Coke Breeze

　　Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, is fully utilizing coke breeze to vigorously develop mixed coking of coke breeze and bituminous coal, increasing coke production to meet the needs of steel production. In just over a month, the county processed more than 1,200 tons of coke breeze, refining more than 700 tons of coke; the coke quality is good and fully meets the requirements of smelting.

　　Drawing Functional Personnel to the Front Line

　　Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company's functional departments vigorously reformed operations, simplified procedures, and improved work efficiency, and correspondingly adjusted management organizations. As a result, about half of the functional personnel were transferred to the grassroots level for a long time to assist in carrying out work, helping workers and the masses to participate in management, and effectively promoting production.

　　Major Innovation in Mine Transportation

　　Hebei Province's metallurgical system has made great achievements in the technical revolution movement of loading, unloading, and transportation. The loading and unloading transportation of six major mines, from loading ore cars at the working face to loading trains, has all been mechanized or semi-mechanized; loading at the working face has been realized by earth chutes and belt conveyor transportation, and transportation has realized steep slope sliding rail transportation. The average train stopping time at the factory has been reduced from about four hours to two and a half hours.

　　Besieging High Sulfur

　　Steel plants in Chengdu are fiercely attacking high sulfur and producing more high-quality steel. Workers have improved operating techniques, exploited the desulfurization potential of cupolas, and promoted the "three-in-one" desulfurization method of salt, lime, and soda ash for external furnace desulfurization. Chengdu Steel Plant and others promoted twelve new technologies, forming a net to attack sulfur from the cupola and converter to pouring and demolding. In the first twenty-seven days of July, the quality pass rate of steel in the city increased by 2.2% compared with June.

    要闻快报
    扩大钢材品种
    长春市各钢厂采取许多措施，在高产的同时增加钢材品种。如长春市钢厂轧钢工人对原有设备进行了一系列改造，创造成一条轧钢生产连续线，并推广了轧钢“围盘化”先进经验。全市7月份以来，钢材品种由只能生产线材单一品种，发展到能生产方钢、带钢、线材、轻轨、鱼尾板等六种钢材。
    充分利用焦粉
    四川省奉节县充分利用焦粉，大搞焦粉、烟煤混合炼焦，增产焦炭，供应钢铁生产需要。一个多月，全县处理焦粉一千二百多吨，炼出七百多吨焦炭；焦炭质量良好，完全符合冶炼要求。抽职能人员上前线
    太原钢铁公司各职能科室大力改革业务，简化业务手续，提高工作效率，并且相应地调整了管理组织。结果抽调出一半左右的职能人员，长期深入到基层协助基层开展工作，帮助工人群众参加管理，有力地促进了生产。矿山运输大革新
    河北省冶金系统的装卸、运输技术革命运动取得很大成绩。六个主要矿山的装卸运输，从掌子面装矿车到装上火车，全部实现了机械化和半机械化；掌子面装车实现了土溜子和皮带机输送，运输实现了陡坡滑行轨道化。火车停厂时间平均由四小时左右压缩到二小时半。
    围攻高硫
    成都市各钢厂猛攻高硫，多炼好钢。职工们改进操作技术，发挥了化铁炉的脱硫潜力；推广了食盐、石灰加苏打的“三合面”脱硫法，进行炉外脱硫。成都钢铁厂等推广十二项新技术，从化铁炉、转炉到浇注脱模，布成了攻硫的天罗地网。7月份前二十七天，全市钢的质量合格率比6月份上升2.2％。
