Multi-Productive, Good Quality Steel

    Not Letting Go of Even an Inch of Material
    Jiang Shaoku, the Party Branch Secretary of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Small Rolling Mill, and the workers of Class C promptly replaced the worn-out rolling grooves. After the new grooves were installed, the speed of steel rolling was still slow. In the first four hours, the production of threaded steel was over three hundred pieces short of the plan, and it seemed impossible to complete the shift plan.
    Jiang Shaoku discussed with the workers beside the rolling mill how to make up for the underproduction of the first half of the shift in the second half. The adjustment worker patted his chest and said, "No problem, I guarantee the machinery runs smoothly." The steel rolling worker also adjusted his strength to ensure the rough rolling kept up. Jiang Shaoku also held a "position meeting" with the Party members to adjust the labor organization. Several skilled steel rolling workers were assigned to key positions.
    The decisive battle began. Jiang Shaoku checked the record sheet from time to time. "Group A rolled seventy-five pieces," "Group B rolled seventy-six pieces"... The output of each group almost surpassed the previous group. At noon, the recorder reported the good news to the dispatch room on behalf of all the workers: Class C overproduced one hundred and thirty pieces and completed the plan!

专栏：多产好钢材

    寸材不让
    鞍钢小型轧钢厂党支部书记蒋绍库和丙班工人一起及时更换了已经磨老的轧槽。新槽换上以后，轧钢的速度又较慢。前四个小时，比计划少产了三百多根螺纹钢。眼看要完不成班计划。
    蒋绍库在轧钢机旁和工人商量，后半班怎样把前半班的欠产补上。调整工拍拍胸脯说：“没问题，保证机械顺行。”轧钢工也调整了力量，保证毛轧跟上来。蒋绍库还和党员开了个“阵地会”，调整了劳动组织。几个轧钢能手都被分配在关口上。
    决战开始了。蒋绍库不时地查看着纪录表。“甲组轧七十五根”，“乙组轧七十六根”……产量几乎是一组压过一组。正午时分，纪录员代表全班工人向调度室报喜：丙班超产一百三十根完成了计划！
