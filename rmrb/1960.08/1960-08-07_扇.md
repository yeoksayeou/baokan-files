    Reported: Under the call of the Municipal Party Committee to "turn the high-temperature season into a high-yield season," leading cadres and workers of Anshan Iron and Steel are declaring war on the summer heat and striving for high output; and a situation of sustained high output has already emerged...
    I saw an old man using a banana leaf fan
    To fan away the days of July one by one,
    He felt the summer heat was a difficult hurdle,
    Hoping to leap over it in one step.
    But I saw in Anshan, our country,
    Workers feel the days are too short,
    As if the hot season,
    Has not come to their side.
    Steelmaking plants, ingot casting plants, iron mines,
    All the way to open hearth furnaces and blast furnaces,
    Workers are welcoming and seeing off the hot July,
    Engaged in large-scale production everywhere.
    Workers shift after shift,
    Rushing to the hottest spots,
    The Party Secretary is the flag bearer,
    Rooted in the front line...
    When the workshops of sustained high yield,
    Reveal the workers' smiling faces,
    I then understand the comrades' aspiration,
    Is to demand high yield from the high temperature!
    When new high-yield records,
    Appear in such hot weather,
    I think the hands of the steelworkers,
    Must be all-powerful big fans.
    Relying on these big fans,
    To dispel the heat,
    Relying on the pair of big fans,
    To heat up and accelerate the furnace to seize high output!
    The big fan is constantly waving,
    Fanning away the time bit by bit,
    Have you felt the harvest of the summer heat?
    The year-end target is about to be exceeded.
    Whether I am awake or asleep,
    I feel the joyful harvest:
    Steel is increasing ton by ton;
    That's why I write poems to congratulate from afar.

    报载：鞍钢领导干部和工人，在市委“变高温季节为高产季节”的号召下，向暑天宣战，正在夺取高产；并已出现了持续高产的局面……
    我见老人用芭蕉扇
    把七月一分一分地搧过，
    他觉得暑期是个难关，
    盼望能一步就跨过。
    可是我见在祖国鞍山，
    工人们正感到日子太短，
    仿佛高温的季节，
    没有来到他们身边。
    炼钢厂，铸锭厂，铁矿山，
    一直到平炉和高炉之间，
    工人们在迎送高温的七月，
    处处在进行大生产。
    工人们一班接一班，
    冲在最热的地点，
    党委书记是旗手，
    脚跟扎在第一线……
    当持续高产的车间，
    浮出了工人的笑脸，
    我才知道同志的志愿，
    是向高温要高产！
    当高产的新纪录，
    出现在这样的热天，
    我想炼钢工人的手，
    一定是万能的大扇。
    凭着这对大扇，
    把炎热驱散，
    凭着大扇一对，
    加温催炉夺高产！
    大扇在不断挥动，
    把时间一分一分地搧过，
    你感到暑期的收获了吗？
    年底的指标就要突破。
    我无论醒着或睡着，
    都感到了喜悦的收获：
    钢材在一吨一吨地增重；
    我才写诗向远方祝贺。
