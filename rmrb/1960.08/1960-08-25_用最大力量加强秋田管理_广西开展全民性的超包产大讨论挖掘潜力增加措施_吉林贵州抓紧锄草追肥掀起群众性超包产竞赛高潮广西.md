Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 24th: An agricultural movement focused on increasing grain production and exceeding contracted targets is underway with great enthusiasm throughout Guangxi. From rural areas to cities, from grassroots to leading organs, the entire autonomous region has mobilized all available forces, concentrating wholeheartedly and going all out to fight solidly through August, September, and October to achieve exceeding production targets for late-season grain.

After the summer harvest, various parts of Guangxi held mass meetings to summarize experiences from the early-season production, conduct summer distribution and award ultra-productive units in a timely manner. At the same time, ideological education on "taking agriculture as the foundation" and "taking grain as the key link" was carried out among the masses, and a mass discussion on exceeding production targets was launched to tap potential and formulate measures, determined to increase late rice production. The late-season surpassing production target competition initiated by 18 communes, including Huangtian, Xindi, and Zhangmu, in Wuzhou Prefecture has received enthusiastic responses from people's communes throughout the entire prefecture.

Managing the already planted mid-season and late-season rice and dryland crops, and continuing to expand autumn planting by every possible means, is key to achieving exceeding production targets for late-season and the whole year's grain production. Nanning Prefecture has adopted two steps to strive for victory in exceeding production targets. The first step is: By August 20th, 1.26 million mu of mid-season rice had been topdressed and weeded, and the planting of more than 5 million mu of late-season rice, corn, beans, etc., had been basically completed. The second step is to weed and topdress the late rice, re-weed and topdress the mid-season rice, and expand the planting of red taro. This step is underway.

In strengthening autumn field management, people in various places are taking fertilizer as the key link and comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. Bobai County mobilizes more than 120,000 people every day to collect green manure, ferment liquid manure, and make mud manure. Currently, more than 176,000 mu of fields in the county have been pressed with green manure. Leli Commune in Tianlin County, a remote mountainous area, has changed the old habit of not applying fertilizer during late-season plowing and harrowing. Not only has a large amount of fertilizer been applied to paddy fields, but also fertilizer has been topdressed for newly reclaimed land and expanded planting of miscellaneous grain crops such as corn and sorghum, and intertillage and weeding have been carried out, resulting in better crop growth than in previous years.

While meticulously managing grain crops, various places are also continuing to expand the autumn planting area by every possible means. Guixian County has 62,000 people participating in sowing every day. Through methods such as surveying wasteland, reclaiming wasteland, and intercropping, they have expanded the planting of more than 100,000 mu of miscellaneous grain crops such as sweet potatoes and late corn. The county's late-season grain crop planting area has expanded by 420,000 mu compared to the same period last year.

In the movement to exceed production targets, cadres at five levels, from the autonomous region to the commune, converge in the fields to firmly grasp the specific leadership of production teams, ensuring that this movement is solid and healthy in its development. Shang Chi, First Secretary of the Baise Prefectural Party Committee, went deep into three production teams in the remote mountainous area of Tianlin County, laboring with the commune members, holding meetings with the cadres, helping the canteen grow vegetables, and helping sick commune members seek medical treatment, enabling these three production teams, where the movement to exceed production targets had been progressing slowly, to catch up quickly.

Jilin

Our correspondent from Changchun, 24th: People's communes in Jilin Province are seizing the current critical period of heading and grain filling for major autumn crops, launching an agricultural movement focused on ensuring seedlings and attacking heading and grain filling to strive for increased autumn grain production.

In the competition, various places first adopted various measures to eliminate weeds, prevent crops from becoming greedy and green, and promote early maturity. More than 61,000 hectares of soybean land in Siping Prefecture have been weeded, and most corn has undergone artificial assisted pollination. This prefecture has also addressed the characteristics of having many low-lying and easily flooded areas by mobilizing 150,000 people to dig ditches and drain water from autumn fields, enabling some waterlogged crops to grow normally. Dongfeng County immediately topdressed quick-acting fertilizer after draining accumulated water from autumn fields to promote rapid crop development.

In the competition, various places generally conducted large-scale inspections and appraisals, and formulated management measures and exceeding production target indicators for waterlogged land, insect-infested land, third-class crop land, and weedy land, respectively, assigning them to plots of land and individuals. They also carried out competitions between production teams by management area to ensure that late-stage field management was carried out quickly and well. People's communes in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, a famous rice-producing area, have cleaned up weeds on many canals and field ridges and removed 15,000 mu of barnyard grass to create good conditions for increasing rice ventilation and sunlight exposure and promoting rice growth. While vigorously grasping autumn field management, various places have also allocated some manpower to seize fertilizer accumulation and forage collection.

In order to ensure that the movement to exceed production targets is carried out in a down-to-earth manner, various places have paid attention to studying the growth patterns of various crops and the new characteristics of late-stage field management this year, and have adopted different management measures for different crops. Some places have adopted methods such as breaking off buds, removing bottom leaves, and releasing autumn ridges for corn and sorghum to reduce water and nutrient consumption, improve crop ventilation and light transmission conditions, increase ground temperature, and promote the growth of tall stalks and large ears; they have implemented measures such as plucking tips, pulling large weeds, and artificial ventilation for soybeans to promote increased flowering and pod retention; they have implemented shallow irrigation, drainage and sunning of fields, and topdressing with ash for rice to prevent greed and lodging and promote early maturity; and they have adopted methods such as topdressing quick-acting fertilizer for various weak seedlings to promote rapid catching up with first-class fields.

In the competition to exceed production targets, the 200,000 cadres sent to rural areas during the summer hoeing production were continued to be placed on the front line, and a large number of cadres were added. Changchun area sent more than 7,000 cadres to grassroots units to serve as deputies. Nong'an County transferred 1,063 commune and management area cadres to production teams to serve as deputy captains. After cadres at all levels went to the grassroots level, they participated in production while helping grassroots cadres summarize experience and improve their leadership level. At the same time, they closely linked with the masses and conscientiously implemented the party's policies, thus further mobilizing the enthusiasm of commune members.

Guizhou

Our correspondent from Guiyang, 24th: Guizhou is widely and deeply carrying out an autumn crop surpassing production target movement centered on strengthening field management. In the past half month, third-class seedlings of autumn harvest crops such as rice and late corn have been reduced to 10% to 15% throughout the province.

After the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee called on various places to vigorously increase autumn harvest grain production in late July, a production upsurge of surpassing production targets quickly swept across the province. In Anshun Prefecture, competitions to surpass production targets were widely carried out between production teams, and the competition between groups within the contracting team and between commune members was also in full swing. After nine professional field management teams in Majiatun Management Area, Chengguan Commune, Xingren County, in this prefecture, launched a competition, they promoted the use of 512 seedling weeders in four days, completed the first weeding and topdressing task of rice five days ahead of schedule, and the first-class seedlings in the entire management area rose from 40% to 70%, and the third-class seedlings fell from 30% to 10%.

In the movement to exceed production targets, cadres in various places have further improved their work style and working methods. The county party committee and commune party committee offices in Renhuai County have all moved to the fields to work; the more than 1,700 cadres who went deep into the production teams constantly consulted with the commune members and continuously enriched the ultra-production measures. Under the leadership of cadres at all levels, more than 100,000 commune members in the county vigorously accumulated fertilizer and applied tillering fertilizer to rice. More than 45,000 mu of lean fields and third-class seedling fields throughout the county have been topdressed more than twice using the method of good fertilizer, less frequent meals, and most of the seedlings have improved. In order to make the labor force on the agricultural front line use it properly, cadres in all parts of the county helped production teams and production teams generally promote small contracting and small section operations, and formed operation teams of five to ten people according to different types of work and processes based on production teams. Because the responsibility was clear, it further stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the commune members and improved work efficiency.

    用最大力量加强秋田管理
    广西开展全民性的超包产大讨论挖掘潜力增加措施
    吉林贵州抓紧锄草追肥掀起群众性超包产竞赛高潮广西
    新华社南宁24日电　以粮食增产为中心的农业超包产运动，已在广西各地热烈展开。全自治区从农村到城市，从基层到领导机关，动员了一切可以动员的力量，全神贯注，全力以赴，扎扎实实地大战8、9、10月，夺取晚造粮食超包产。
    夏收以后，广西各地都召开了群众会议，一方面总结上造生产经验，及时进行夏季分配和奖励超产单位。一方面在群众中进行了
  “以农业为基础”、“以粮为纲”的思想教育，并开展了全民性的超包产的大讨论，挖潜力、订措施，决心使晚稻增产。梧州专区的黄田、新地、樟木等十八个公社发起的晚造超包产竞赛，得到全专区各人民公社的热烈响应。
    管好已经种下的中、晚稻和旱粮，千方百计继续扩大秋种，是实现晚造和全年粮食超包产的关键。南宁专区采取了两个步骤争取超包产胜利。第一个步骤是：到8月20日止，给一百二十六万亩中稻进行了追肥耘田，基本完成了五百多万亩晚稻、玉米、豆类等的种植任务。第二个步骤是给晚稻耘田追肥，中稻再次耘田追肥和扩种红茹。这个步骤正在进行。
    在加强秋田管理中，各地人民都以肥料为纲，全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”。博白县每天出动十二万多人，采绿肥、沤水肥、制泥肥，现在全县已有十七万六千多亩田压了绿肥。边远山区的田林县乐里公社，改变了过去晚造翻耙不下肥的旧习惯，不仅水田施了大量肥料，新开荒地扩种的玉米、高粱等杂粮作物，也追施了肥料，进行了中耕除草，作物生长比往年都好。
    各地一面认真细致管好粮食作物，一面千方百计继续扩大秋种面积。贵县每天有六万二千人参加播种，他们通过查荒、开荒、间种等办法，扩种了红薯、晚玉米等杂粮作物十多万亩，全县晚造粮食作物种植面积比去年同期扩大了四十二万亩。
    在超包产运动中从自治区到公社，五级干部会师田间，狠抓生产小队的具体领导，使这一运动扎扎实实，健康发展。中共百色地委第一书记尚持同志，深入田林县边远山区的三个生产小队，同社员一起劳动，同干部一起开会，帮助食堂搞种菜，帮助有病社员就医，使这三个超包产运动原来进展较缓慢的小队，很快地赶上去了。吉林
    本报长春24日电　吉林省各人民公社抓住目前大秋作物抽穗度粒的关键时期，掀起以保棵、攻穗度粒为内容的农业超包产运动，力争秋粮增产。
    各地在竞赛中，首先采取各种措施消灭杂草，防止作物贪青，促进作物早熟。四平专区已有六万一千多公顷大豆地拔了草，大部分苞米实行了人工辅助授粉。这个专区还针对低洼易涝地多的特点，出动十五万人给秋田挖沟排水，使一部分内涝庄稼正常生长。东丰县在秋田排出积水后立即追施了速效肥，促进作物迅速发育。
    在竞赛中，各地普遍进行了大检查、大评比，对涝洼地、虫灾地、三类庄稼地、草荒地等分别制定管理措施和超包产指标，落实到地块、落实到人，并以管理区为单位开展生产队与生产队之间的竞赛，使后期田间管理搞得又快又好。著名的水稻产区延边朝鲜族自治州各人民公社，已把许多渠道、地埂上的杂草割净，拔净稻稗一万五千亩，为增加水稻的通风日照，促使水稻生长创造了良好条件。各地在大抓秋田管理的同时，又分出一部分力量，抓紧积造肥料和采集饲草等工作。
    为了使超包产运动开展得踏踏实实，各地都注意研究各种庄稼生长的规律和今年后期田间管理的新特点，对各种作物分别采取了不同的管理措施。有些地方对苞米、高粱采取掰芽子、打底叶、放秋垅的办法，减少水分和养分的消耗，改善作物通风透光条件，增高地温，促使长高棵、结大穗；对大豆实行掏尖、拔大草、人工通风等措施，促使增花保荚；对水稻实行了浅灌水、排水晒田、追施草木灰等措施，防止贪青倒伏，促使早熟；对各种弱苗庄稼则采取追施速效肥等办法，促使迅速赶上一类田。
    在超包产竞赛中，把夏锄生产中派到农村的二十万名干部继续放在第一线上，并且增派了大批干部。长春地区派出七千多名干部到基层单位担任副职。农安县抽调了一千零六十三名公社、管理区干部到生产队担任副队长。各级干部到基层以后，一方面参加生产，一方面帮助基层干部总结经验，提高他们的领导水平，同时密切联系群众，认真贯彻党的方针政策，因而进一步调动了社员的积极性。贵州
    本报贵阳24日电　贵州各地广泛深入开展以加强田间管理为中心的秋季作物超包产运动。近半月来，全省水稻、晚玉米等秋收作物的三类苗，已经降到10％到15％。
    7月下旬，中共贵州省委号召各地大力增产秋收粮食以后，一个超包产竞赛的生产高潮，迅速在全省掀起。安顺专区各生产小队之间广泛地开展了超包产竞赛，承包小队内部组与组、社员与社员之间的对手赛也开展得热火朝天。这个专区兴仁县城关公社马家屯管理区九个田间管理专业队开展对手赛后，四天就推广使用了五百一十二把薅秧耙，提前五天完成了水稻的头道薅秧追肥任务，全管理区一类苗由40％上升到70％，三类苗由30％下降到10％。
    在超包产运动中，各地干部进一步改进了工作作风和工作方法。仁怀县县委和公社党委的办公室，都搬到了田间办公；深入到生产小队的一千七百多名干部，都随时和社员商量，不断充实超产措施。全县十多万社员在各级干部的带领下，大积肥料，大施水稻分蘖肥。全县四万五千多亩瘦田和三类苗田，采取好肥少吃多餐的办法，已追施二次以上，绝大部分禾苗已好转。为了使农业第一线的劳力用之得当，全县各地干部帮助生产队和生产小队普遍推行了小包工、小段作业，以生产小队为单位，对劳力进行全面安排，合理分工，按照不同的工种、工序组成五到十人的作业小组。由于责任明确，进一步激发了社员的劳动积极性，提高了工效。
