    Comprehensive Rectification, Strengthened Management, and Improved Technology
    Jianyang's Commune-Run Industrial Products Greatly Increase, Labor Greatly Conserved

    Editor's Note: Jianyang County's commune-run industry, after comprehensive rectification, has greatly increased its products and greatly conserved labor, supporting agricultural production with more material and human resources. This is a successful experience and worth learning from in various places.
    There are currently over 200,000 commune-run industrial production units nationwide. If they can all, like Jianyang County, strengthen the Party's leadership, conduct planned rectification, improve business management, innovate production technology, and implement the principle of running more during the slack season, running less during the busy season, and stopping during the very busy season, practicing part-time farming and part-time work and worker-peasant cooperation, they can produce more and better farm tools, fertilizers, and pesticides, and save a large amount of labor to participate in agricultural production. This is a significant force for the ongoing production increase and conservation campaign centered on grain in rural areas, and various regions should pay close attention to this matter.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 18th: The commune-run industries in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, based on the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation, have achieved both great manpower reduction and great production increase through comprehensive rectification and improvement.
    Since April, the county has transferred 24,400 people from commune-run industrial enterprises, accounting for 65% of the original total number of people in commune-run industries. These people have all been put into the front line of agricultural production. Currently, the labor force occupied by commune-run industries in the county accounts for only about 3% of the total labor force participating in grading, while industrial production has greatly increased compared to March before the manpower reduction, especially the output of products urgently needed for agricultural production. Among them, farm tools increased by 33.5%, fertilizers increased by 75.5%, and pesticides increased by 24%.
    Before the rectification in March this year, the county's commune-run industries had 34 business projects, more than 2,480 factories, and occupied a labor force of 37,200 people, accounting for 3.6% of the total labor force participating in grading in various communes. At that time, the proportion of output value of these commune-run industries directly serving agricultural production was only about half. In order to change this situation and enable commune-run industries to better serve agricultural production, the Jianyang County Party Committee decisively led various communes to carry out a major rectification and improvement of commune-run industries in accordance with the spirit of concentrating labor into the front line of agricultural production. First, the miscellaneous projects were summarized and merged, and each commune only established four factories: farm tools, chemical industry, agricultural and sideline product processing, and daily necessities industrial products. After rectification, the county's original more than 2,480 commune-run factories were merged into 369 factories. Not only was a large number of workers freed up, but more than 2,100 non-production personnel were also reduced.
    After the rectification, the leadership, technical strength, equipment, and funds of commune-run industries could be used centrally, and the industrial sectors closely related to agricultural production were also strengthened compared to the past. Before the rectification, due to the large number of factories and their dispersion, most factories had not established Party and Communist Youth League organizations, and the management work lacked sound rules and regulations. After the rectification, Party and Communist Youth League branches were established in each factory, and political and ideological work was strengthened; at the same time, each factory generally implemented the four major management systems of planning, technology, labor, and finance, and improved labor organization. Since the communes concentrated the skilled craftsmen and machinery scattered in various factories, 146 new products such as farm tools, fertilizers, and pesticides have been successfully trial-produced and put into production. Products that could not be produced by the communes in the past, such as indigenous urea, indigenous 1605 pesticide, hand-operated water pumps, and multi-purpose shredders, which require more complex technology, can now be produced in large quantities. The most prominent effect of centralized use of funds is to accelerate the turnover time and reduce national loans. More than one-third of the county's commune-run factories have been able to be self-reliant.
    Commune-run industries generally have strong seasonality. They seized this law, vigorously carried out inter-factory collaboration and implemented part-time work and farming and worker-peasant cooperation. This is an important factor for Jianyang County's commune-run industries to achieve both great manpower reduction and great production increase. For example, during the first half of the year, the farm tool factory and the chemical factory were the busiest in production, while the work of the agricultural and sideline product processing factory was relatively less at this time. The communes transferred half of the labor force from the agricultural and sideline product processing factory to the farm tool factory and the chemical factory. As a result, the production tasks of both sides were completed on schedule.
    Their practice of implementing part-time work and farming and worker-peasant cooperation is: each factory cadre must plant agricultural experimental fields; workers use their spare time to contract and manage the "high-yield plots" around the factory (the county's commune-run industries contract for 215 high-yield plots, nearly 25,000 mu). During the busy farming season, the factories also devote most of their efforts to directly participate in agricultural production. During the rush harvest and planting in the second quarter of this year, the commune-run factories did a total of 280,000 workdays for agriculture. The agricultural sector also gave strong support to the industrial sector. For example, in June, the chemical factory lacked raw materials for manufacturing indigenous pesticides, so the communes mobilized more than 100,000 "extra-grade" laborers to collect more than 1.56 million jin of wild pesticide raw materials in three days. Recently, the Luodai Commune used the farming time gap after the rain when they could not go to the fields, and organized more than 1,500 commune members to rush to mine more than 700,000 jin of phosphate rock powder in half a day, which is enough for the commune's chemical factory to use for one month.
    In the rectification of commune-run industries, Jianyang County paid special attention to mobilizing the masses and vigorously carrying out technical innovation. After more than two months of efforts, the chemical factories of the communes have generally realized innovations such as vehicle transportation, factory rail transportation, pulverization and grinding by animal power, and tap water for water use, generally increasing work efficiency by more than one time. The production volume of indigenous fertilizer has increased from an average daily output of 300-400 jin per person in the past to about 1,000 jin. The ginning, delinting, and oil extraction of cotton processing have also realized a one-stop production linkage, which has increased work efficiency by 1.3 times and saved 70% of labor compared to the past. Some farm tool factories have begun to use blowers, and work efficiency has increased several times.

    全面整顿　加强管理　提高技术
    简阳社办工业产品大增加劳力大节约
    编者按：简阳县的社办工业，经过全面整顿，产品大量增加，劳力大量节约，以更多的物力、人力支援农业生产，这是一个成功的经验，值得各地学习。
    全国现有二十多万个社办工业生产单位，如果都能像简阳县这样，加强党的领导，有计划地进行整顿，改进经营管理，革新生产技术，并根据农闲多办、农忙少办、大忙停办的原则，实行农忙务农、农闲做工的亦工亦农、工农协作的办法，就可以生产出更多更好的农具、化肥、农药，又能节约出大量的劳力参加农业生产。这对当前农村开展的以粮食为中心的增产节约运动是一个不小的力量，各地应该把这件事很好地抓起来。
    新华社成都18日电　四川省简阳县各公社社办工业根据以农业为基础的方针，经过全面整顿和提高，做到了大减人又大增产。
    4月份以来，全县从社办工业企业中抽调了两万四千四百多人，占原来社办工业总人数的65％。这些人已全部投入农业生产第一线。现在全县社办工业占用的劳力仅占参加评级劳力总数的3％左右，而工业生产却比减人以前的3月份大大增加，特别是农业生产急需的产品的产量，其中农具增加33.5％，肥料增加75.5％，农药增加24％。
    这个县的社办工业在今年3月份未进行整顿时，共有三十四个经营项目、二千四百八十多个厂，占用劳动力三万七千二百多人，占各社参加评级劳力总数的3.6％，当时这些社办工业中直接服务于农业生产的产值比重只有一半左右。为了改变这种情况，使社办工业更好地为农业生产服务，中共简阳县委根据集中劳力投入农业生产第一线的精神，当机立断，领导各社对社办工业进行了大整顿、大提高。首先是将五花八门的项目加以归纳合并，各公社只建立农具、化工、农副产品加工和日用必需工业品等四个厂。经过整顿全县原有的二千四百八十多个社办工厂就合并成了三百六十九个工厂。不仅腾出了大量工人，还减掉了二千一百多个非生产人员。
    经过整顿以后，社办工业的领导力量、技术力量以及设备、资金等得以集中使用，与农业生产关系密切的工业部门也比过去增强。整顿前，由于厂多分散，大部分工厂都未建立党、团组织，经营管理工作缺乏健全的规章制度。整顿后，各厂都建立了党、团支部，加强了政治思想工作；同时各工厂普遍实行了计划、技术、劳力、财务四大管理制度，健全了劳动组织。各公社自从把分散在各厂的能工巧匠和机具集中使用以后，试制成功并投入生产的农具、化肥、农药等新产品，就有一百四十六种。过去各公社不能生产的土尿素、土一六零五、手摇水泵、多用切碎机等技术较为复杂的产品，现在都能大量生产了。资金集中使用的效果，最突出的是加快了周转时间，减少了国家贷款。全县有三分之一以上的社办工厂已能自力更生。
    社办工业大都有强烈的季节性，他们抓住这个规律，大力开展厂际协作和实行亦工亦农、工农协作。这是简阳县社办工业能够大减人又大增产的一个重要因素。例如，上半年度农具厂、化工厂的生产最忙，而农副产品加工厂的工作这时比较少，各社就将农副产品加工厂一半的劳力调到农具厂和化工厂，结果两方面的生产任务都按期完成。
    他们实行亦工亦农、工农协作的作法是：工厂干部每人都要种植农业试验田；工人则利用工余时间包干管理工厂周围“高产片”（全县社办工业包干的高产片有二百一十五处，将近二万五千亩）。在农忙时，各工厂还抽出大部力量直接参加农业生产。今年二季度抢收抢种时，各社办工厂为农业共做了二十八万个劳动日。农业方面也给工业方面有力的支援。如6月份化工厂制造土农药的原料缺乏，各社就发动“级外”劳力十多万人，突击三天，采集了农药野生原料一百五十六万多斤。洛带公社最近利用雨后不能下地的农事空隙时间，组织社员一千五百多人，突击半天开采磷矿粉七十多万斤，足够这个公社化工厂一月用的生产原料。
    简阳县在整顿社办工业中，特别注意发动群众，大闹技术革新。经过最近两个多月来的努力，各公社的化工厂已普遍实现了运输车子化，厂内轨道化，粉碎驮碾化，用水自来化等革新，一般提高工效一倍以上，土化肥生产量由过去每人平均日产三、四百斤，提高到千斤左右。棉花加工的轧花、脱绒、榨油也实现了一条龙生产联动化，比过去提高工效一点三倍，节约劳力70％。部分农具厂已使用上鼓风机，工效提高了几倍。
