　　In order to produce more grain, a surge in increased planting is constantly sweeping across various regions this year. All means are being used to expand the planting area, making the proportion of increased planting crops significantly larger than in previous years. This situation presents us with an important question: managing increased planting crops well is a major task in current agricultural production and an effective measure to strive for a greater grain harvest in the autumn.

　　Whether increased planting crops can be managed well depends crucially on whether they are valued. Increased planting crops should be treated like Sichuan does, regarding them the same as regular crops.

　　More planting is for more harvesting. Whether it's regular crops or increased planting crops, they must be effectively managed to achieve the goal of greater harvest.

    一视同仁
    为了增产更多的粮食，今年各地不断掀起增种热潮，千方百计扩大播种面积，使增种作物的比重大大超过往年。这个情况给我们提出一个重要的问题：管好增种作物，是当前农业生产上的一件大事，是争取秋季收获更多粮食的有效措施。
    能不能管好增种作物，关键决定于对它是否重视。对增种作物应当像四川那样，把增种作物和正种作物一样看待。
    多种是为了多收，不论正种还是增种的作物，都要切实管好，才能实现多收的目的。
