By learning from advanced models and adopting their strengths to compensate for one's weaknesses, cadres at all levels in Anqing Special District have significantly improved their work style after studying Zhang Yulin's approach. Shang Yishun's work style in Lujiang County has flourished among cadres at all levels throughout the county.

This newspaper reports that Anqing Special District in Anhui Province has extensively and thoroughly carried out a campaign to study Zhang Yulin, the Party Branch Secretary of the Shuangxi Brigade in Kongcheng Commune, Tongcheng County. Over 180,000 cadres, Party members, and Youth League members throughout the special district have participated in the study. Through this learning process, the vast majority of cadres have further promoted their excellent work style, improved their working methods, and actively gone into backward teams and canteens to focus on production and the lives of the masses. They have eaten, lived, worked, and consulted with the masses, resulting in significant improvements in their work.

In the campaign to learn from Zhang Yulin, various localities have closely integrated learning with production, identifying key learning points. Counties like Guichi, Tongcheng, and Huaining emphasized learning from Zhang Yulin's approach of going deep among the masses, caring for them on a broad level, and relying on them to complete various work tasks. This has yielded immediate results. In Guichi County, over 700 cadres regularly serve as cooks in canteens, delving into and helping resolve issues in daily life. Yu Zaishu, the Party Branch Secretary of the Changcun Brigade in Tongshan Commune, along with the cooks, developed a rudimentary water pipe system using bamboo, enabling all four canteens in the brigade to free up fourteen people daily to participate in production. After studying Zhang Yulin, Party secretaries at all levels in Tongcheng County cultivated over 600 "experimental plots" for canteens and assigned over 2,000 cadres to work as cooks in the canteens, properly arranging the lives of commune members during the busy farming season. They also assisted canteens in establishing a solid foundation, turning them into a powerful logistics department during the busy farming season.

Many places have used Zhang Yulin as a mirror in the campaign to learn from him, organizing cadres to conduct self-examinations. Zhang Chengqi, the Party Branch Secretary of the Zhengwei Brigade in Shuanggang Commune, Tongcheng County, after studying Zhang Yulin's deeds of fighting against conservative thinking and resolutely supporting the growth of new things, realized that Zhang Yulin listened to the masses with analysis. He proactively examined his serious lesson from last year when he mistakenly listened to a few wealthy middle peasants in promoting improved rice varieties. He had approved the plowing and turning over of a portion of early japonica rice and replanted it with single-season late rice, resulting in a 50% reduction in yield compared to the early japonica rice. He stated that in the future, he must use class analysis methods to listen to opinions, resist unhealthy trends, and protect the growth of new things.

Many regions have also combined the campaign to learn from Zhang Yulin with their own regional cadre competition and evaluation campaigns, establishing models and creating a wave of emulation.

This newspaper reports that after cadres at all levels in Lujiang County, Anhui Province, studied the work style of Shang Yishun, a cadre in the county, their work style and working methods have greatly improved, powerfully promoting various tasks.

Shang Yishun is the Party Branch Secretary of the Model Brigade in Tongda Commune, Lujiang County. For ten years, he has consistently grasped the two magic weapons of "diligence" and "thrift." In particular, he has used the methods of "planting (planting experimental plots well), moving (moving the office to the fields), squatting (squatting in poor teams), leading (taking the lead in doing the most difficult work), squeezing (squeezing time to participate in labor), and learning (learning politics, culture, and technology)," which have enabled the brigade he leads to consistently maintain the title of Model Brigade. In order to extensively and thoroughly learn from Shang Yishun, Party committees at all levels throughout the county have utilized various meetings, newspapers, radio stations, blackboards, and lecturers to conduct propaganda activities deep in the fields. Currently, Shang Yishun's deeds are well-known throughout the county.

"In the past, it took three or four transfers to hear about a problem, but now cadres are in the fields, discussing and solving everything while working." This is the praise from the masses for cadres who have learned from Shang Yishun and moved their offices to the fields to help the masses solve problems. All sixteen communes and 193 brigades in the county have moved their offices to the fields, with over 2,500 cadres working in the fields during the day and living with commune members at night, promptly discovering problems and quickly resolving them.

Currently, in order to further learn from Shang Yishun's excellent qualities, Lujiang County has launched a campaign of learning, comparing, catching up, and evaluating. New "Shang Yishuns" are constantly emerging, and 4,450 cadres have already been evaluated as having good ideology, good work style, good labor production, good listening to the opinions of the masses, good diligence and thrift, and good implementation of policies.

    对照先进镜子取人长补己短
    安庆专区各级干部学习张玉林作风有了显著改进
    庐江县商宜顺的工作作风在全县各级干部中开花
    本报讯　安徽省安庆专区广泛深入地开展学习桐城县孔城公社双溪大队党总支书记张玉林的运动。全专区参加学习的干部、党员、团员，达十八万多人。通过学习，广大干部进一步发扬了优良作风，改进了工作方法，纷纷深入后进队、深入食堂，狠抓生产和群众生活，与群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，工作有了显著改进。
    各地在学习张玉林运动中，都紧密结合生产，提出了学习重点。贵池、桐城，怀宁等县，强调学习张玉林善于深入群众，从大处关心群众，依靠群众完成各项工作任务的作风和方法，收到了立竿见影的效果。贵池县有七百多干部定期到食堂当炊事员，深入帮助解决生活中的问题。这个县桐山公社长村大队党支部书记余在书和炊事员一起研究，用竹管制成了土自来水管，使全大队四个食堂每天可抽出十四个人参加生产。桐城县各级党委书记学习张玉林后，培养了六百多个食堂“试验田”，两千多名干部到食堂当炊事员，妥善安排了农忙期间的社员生活；帮助食堂建立家底，使食堂成为农忙中有力的后勤部。
    许多地方在学习张玉林运动中，把张玉林作为一面镜子，组织干部对照检查，桐城双港公社郑圩大队总支书记张成启，在学习了张玉林与保守思想作斗争，坚决支持新生事物成长的事迹以后，认识到张玉林听群众话是有分析的听，主动检查了去年在推广水稻良种中误听了少数富裕中农的话，批准翻犁掉一部分早粳稻，改插了单季晚稻，结果比早粳稻少收50％的严重教训，表示今后一定要用阶级分析的方法听取意见，顶住歪风邪气，保护新生事物的成长。
    很多地区还把学习张玉林运动同自己地区干部竞赛评比运动结合起来，树立标兵，掀起你追我赶的热潮。
    本报讯　安徽省庐江县各级干部学习了该县干部商宜顺的工作作风以后，工作作风和工作方法都有很大改进，有力地推动了各项工作。
    商宜顺是庐江县同大公社模范大队党总支书记。十年来，他一直抓住“勤”、“俭”两件法宝，特别是他用“种（种好试验田）、搬
  （办公室搬到田头）、蹲（蹲在穷队）、带（带头干最困难的活）、挤（挤时间参加劳动）、学（学政治、文化、技术）”的办法，使他领导的大队，一直保持着模范大队的称号。为了广泛深入地学习商宜顺，全县各级党委利用各种会议，通过报纸、广播站、黑板报、报告员深入田间讲解等办法，开展宣传活动。目前商宜顺的事迹已经在全县做到家喻户晓。
    “以往有问题三转四传才听见，现在干部在田间，边干边谈解决全。”这是群众对干部学习商宜顺后把办公室搬到田间，帮助群众解决问题的赞语。全县十六个公社，一百九十三个大队，都把办公室搬到田间，二千五百多名干部，白天在田间干活，夜间同社员一起住，及时发现问题，迅速得到解决。
    现在，庐江县为了进一步学习商宜顺的优良品质，开展了学、比、赶、评的运动，新的“商宜顺”不断涌现，已评出思想好、作风好、劳动生产好、听取群众意见好、勤俭节约好、贯彻政策好的干部达四千四百五十人。
