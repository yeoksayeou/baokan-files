A New Era, New People
By our reporter Wang Yuzhang

Korea is in the era of the Chollima (Flying Horse) movement. In this brand-new era, the Korean people are not only propelling socialist construction to a new high tide and creating all kinds of miracles, but also actively arming themselves with communist ideology. People's mental outlook and the relationships between people are undergoing rapid changes. New ideas and styles such as love for the collective, unity and mutual assistance, and mutual cooperation are rapidly forming and developing, and socialist-communist new people are emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.

Coordinated Operations Before the Steel Furnace

The workers of the No. 4 open-hearth furnace in the steelmaking workshop of the Huanghai Iron and Steel Works have just finished smelting a furnace of steel and are feeding materials into the furnace. The workers formed a large circle, one after another rushing to the furnace door with large iron shovels to throw ore into the furnace. Furnace chief Jin Chun-dong was throwing when he suddenly discovered two more people in the circle. Upon closer inspection, they turned out to be Tian Shanjie and Jin Yuanheng from the No. 5 furnace, who had come to help. Today, this kind of mutual assistance has become a new trend in this factory. One day, Zheng Chengzhen, the leader of Ding Class in the No. 3 furnace, was repairing the furnace. He crawled into the scorching hot furnace wearing a wet straw bag, and the straw bag dried quickly. Despite the discomfort of the heat, he insisted on continuing the repair. Suddenly, Li Yunxu, the leader of Yi Class, changed his clothes, put on a wet straw bag, and came to replace him in repairing the furnace, also helping them to remove the slag. Before long, Li Yonghao, the leader of Jia Class, also arrived with workers, and everyone quickly repaired the steel furnace together. In the past, a medium repair of the steel furnace at the Huanghai Iron and Steel Works took ten to fifteen days, but now it only takes six or seven days.

Today in Korea, not only are workers within a factory helping each other, but also various factories are launching large-scale communist cooperation. In order to realize agricultural mechanization as soon as possible, the various machinery factories in Korea, with the Giyang Tractor Factory as the center, carried out large-scale cooperation in the production of tractors. The Giyang Tractor Factory manufactures the main parts of the tractor, while many factories such as the Heechon Machine Tool Factory and the Unsan Tool Factory manufacture various parts such as gearboxes and screws for it. The workers in these factories innovate technology and work hard to ensure the timely production of high-quality parts to be sent to the Giyang Tractor Factory. In the Chollima movement, Korean machinery factories also used various large-scale cooperative methods to produce complete sets of blast furnace equipment and large rolling mill equipment that were previously considered impossible for Korea to manufacture itself. Recently, the collaborative manufacture of a 5,000-kilowatt water turbine, centered on the Longcheng Machinery Factory, has been completed.

Not only within the industrial sector, but also between factories and agricultural cooperatives, mutual assistance is being implemented. In northern Korea, a system of linking factories and cooperatives has been widely implemented, with factories helping agricultural cooperatives to promote agricultural mechanization, and agricultural cooperatives helping factories to solve problems such as non-staple foods and vegetables. Not to mention large heavy industrial factories producing various machines such as electric motors and water pumps for agricultural cooperatives, even workers in light industrial factories such as the Pyongyang Tobacco Factory launched a movement to collect 100 kilograms of scrap iron per person during Sundays and after work hours, and then made more than 2,300 pieces of farm tools such as iron shovels and hoes themselves, sending them to the Sanshi Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Pyongyang.

Zhu Chengyi and the People Around Him

Today in Korea, the story of Zhu Chengyi, a lathe operator from the Longcheng Machinery Factory, helping those who lag behind is circulating everywhere.

Zhu Chengyi is a twenty-four-year-old young vanguard on the industrial front, like a little tiger. He and the young people in his class created multi-tool and multi-blade cutting tools and high-speed cutting methods, increasing cutting efficiency by five or six times, and won the honorary title of "Chollima Work Team" last year. But he was not satisfied with this. He firmly remembered Premier Kim Il-sung's teachings: "The innovation movement is not limited to one or a few people, but is carried out among the broad masses; it is not only one person who becomes a hero, but many people should become heroes." Thus, after completing his production plan every day, he spent four hours helping other work teams. He taught his high-speed cutting method to sixteen work teams, and also helped them manufacture more than one hundred advanced tools and fixtures. In addition, he also helped the leaders of other work teams with ideological work. In the past, some of these work teams could not complete their production plans, but now they have all become advanced work teams. Zhu Chengyi also tried every means to accelerate the improvement of the technology of the people around him. An apprentice he led became a lathe operator capable of working independently in only forty days. This young man named Jin Baoxue, who graduated from junior high school, came to Zhu Chengyi to be his assistant. Zhu Chengyi treated him like an older brother treats a younger brother, working, eating, and sleeping with him, and using all kinds of spare time to explain technology to him. Sometimes Jin Baoxue would raise a question in the middle of the night, and Zhu Chengyi would take him to the workshop in front of the machine tool to help him answer it that very night. As a result, he created the miracle of training a technician in forty days.

Helping others has simply become Zhu Chengyi's profession and hobby. One day, Zhu Chengyi received a letter from Han Xiyong. Han Xiyong used to be a worker in his class, but now he is studying at a mechanical vocational school. He wanted to borrow Zhu Chengyi's "Machine Tool Manufacturing," a book that is currently unavailable. This book is Zhu Chengyi's "treasure," and he has had it in his hands every day for three years. However, for the needs of others to learn technology theory, Zhu Chengyi bought a notebook and copied the main points of the book himself overnight, and then gave his "treasure" to Han Xiyong. Zhu Chengyi is like this, willing to bear any sacrifice himself for the progress of others. Therefore, people praised him and said, "There is no one lagging behind around Zhu Chengyi."

Zhu Chengyi has become a shining banner. Currently, under the slogan of "working, studying, and living with a communist spirit," the five or six thousand advanced collectives and hundreds of thousands of workers who have joined the "Chollima Work Team" movement are all taking Zhu Chengyi as an example, actively helping and leading everyone to strive for common progress.

The Story of a Warehouse Manager

Jin Rongzhe, a demobilized soldier, serves as a warehouse manager at a wholesale station in the commercial system in Tanchuan, South Hamgyong Province. This is a most ordinary job. However, if you listen to his story, you will see how brilliantly communist ideas have blossomed in the commercial workers of Korea.

Jin Rongzhe was assigned to this position after being demobilized last spring. As a warehouse manager, he did everything he should do: as soon as he took over, he quickly overcame the chaos in the warehouse, registered more than 3,000 kinds of goods with cards, and managed the warehouse in an orderly manner. In the middle of a stormy night, he ran to the warehouse to see if the roof was leaking. He used waste paper to make wrapping paper, used broken straw bags to make bundling ropes, and repaired damaged children's toys and other goods in transit before selling them. He also created various methods for storing goods: how to keep snow cream from drying out, how to prevent glass frames from breaking, and so on.

What Jin Rongzhe did was not just these things. This spring, Jin Rongzhe heard an old man from the Ling Mountain Agricultural Cooperative who came to transport goods say: Now the countryside lacks ploughshares, and if there were ploughshares, the efficiency of spring plowing could be improved. He immediately wrote letters to agricultural tool factories in various places, and the factories quickly manufactured a large number of ploughshares and sent them in time to meet the needs of agricultural production.

Jin Rongzhe has made it a habit to run to various stores whenever he has time to see the sales of daily necessities. One day, he saw that many customers wanted to buy small mirrors, but the store was out of stock, and there were none in the warehouse. The salesperson was so anxious that there was nothing he could do. Jin Rongzhe immediately ran to the Tanchuan Wood Processing Production Cooperative to discuss the issue of making small mirrors. The cooperative said that they could not make them without glass. Jin Rongzhe immediately ran back to the warehouse and picked out three boxes of glass that could be used to make small mirrors from the broken pieces of glass left over from selling glass, and sent them to the cooperative. A few days later, the cooperative made a thousand small mirrors and sent them to the store, satisfying the customers' needs.

Jin Rongzhe is also a strict commodity inspector. Every batch of goods sent to his warehouse is checked for quality. Once, pen nibs produced by the Qingjin Hardware Factory were sent, and he found that they were too hard and too sharp, and always scratched the paper. He wrote a letter to the Qingjin Hardware Factory asking them to improve the quality. Once, the quality of the toys and shoe brushes sent were not good, and he immediately went to the Tanchuan Rongjun Daily Necessities Factory, which produced these goods, to study with them how to improve the quality. As a result, the quality of the factory's products was improved, and the customers were satisfied.

Like Jin Rongzhe, today the commercial workers on the Korean commercial front are all wholeheartedly for the customers and everything for the people. Commercial workers in the countryside carry timely goods on their backs to the fields during the busy farming season to meet the needs of the masses in a timely manner. The Jin Chunying sales team of the Pyongyang West District Department Store, which won the title of "Chollima" work team, whenever customers come to buy goods that are out of stock or the color and variety do not meet the requirements, they write down the customer's address, and then try every means to get the goods that the customer needs and deliver them to their door, or mail them to them. In just four months, they have solved more than a thousand commodities for customers in this way. The reporter recently visited a food store in front of the Pyongyang Railway Station. This store has set up a wooden box at the entrance of each floor of the nearby residential building. The staff are busy with production and work and do not have time to go to the store to buy vegetables themselves. As long as they write a note and put it in the wooden box, indicating what vegetables to buy and what time to deliver them to what number, the staff of the store will deliver the prepared dishes to his dining table. Liu Fennyu, the manager of this store, said: Now women have also straddled the Chollima and participated in socialist construction. We must ensure that they eat well. No matter how troublesome or difficult it is, we will take it upon ourselves.

Communist Saplings

On July 2 this year, in Yuanpingli, Bicheng County, South Hwanghae Province, a moving story of a thirteen-year-old child, Jin Rizhu, sacrificing himself to save others occurred. On this day, Jin Rizhu was walking along a river when he suddenly heard cries for help, "Chengjun is drowning!" He immediately ran over and saw that three children were washing their hands by the river, and an eight-year-old child named Wu Chengjun had been swept into the deep water. Seeing this situation, Jin Rizhu immediately jumped into the water to rescue the drowning child. Although he could swim, he was small and not strong enough, and coupled with the rapid water, he and the child he was rescuing were submerged eight times in a row. Just as he was about to swim to the shore, he was swept away by the water again. Finally, he used all his strength to push Wu Chengjun ashore, but he himself had no strength to come up. To save others, Jin Rizhu sacrificed his own life.

The ideological qualities of communism are growing particularly fast in children. Today's Korean children are so fond of labor, love the collective, and are united and helpful. In the season of planting trees in spring, you can see teams of Young Pioneers climbing the hillsides everywhere in northern Korea, planting "Young Pioneer Forests." In the dry summer, children in groups carry basins and buckets to help the farmers fight drought. On the railway line from Pyongyang to Nampo, a green passenger car runs. On each car of the train, there are three large characters: "Young Pioneer." Whoever takes this train is moved by the children's love for labor, because this train, from the locomotive to the carriages, was purchased by Korean children with the money they earned by raising rabbits, planting sunflowers, and picking up scrap iron in their own small five-year plans. This year, the children again used the same method to buy thirty tractors and give them to the farmers. Under the nourishment of the sunshine and rain of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic Government, these communist saplings are growing rapidly.

    新的时代新的人
    本报记者　王玉章
    朝鲜正处在千里马时代。在这个崭新时代里，朝鲜人民不仅把社会主义建设推向高潮，创造出了种种奇迹；而且积极地以共产主义思想来武装自己，人们的精神面貌，人和人之间的关系日新月异地发生着变化。热爱集体、团结互助、互相协作等种种新的思想、新的风格正在迅速地形成和发展，社会主义—共产主义的新人正像雨后春笋般地涌现出来。
    炼钢炉前的协同作战
    黄海制铁所炼钢车间第四号平炉的工人们刚刚炼完了一炉钢，正在向炉内投料。工人们排成了一个大圆圈，一个接一个地端着大铁锹冲向炉门口，向炉内投矿石。炉长金春东正在投着，忽然发现圆圈内多出了两个人，仔细一看，原来是五号炉的工人田善杰和金元亨来帮忙了。今天在这个工厂里，这样的互相帮助已成为一种新的风气。有一天，三号炉丁班的班长郑成俊正在修炉，他披着淋湿了的草袋子钻进滚热的炉内，一会儿草袋子就干了。他不顾烤得很难受，正在坚持着继续修，忽然乙班的班长李云绪换了衣服，披上湿草袋就来代替他修炉，而且还帮助他们清除了炉渣。不一会，甲班的班长李永浩也领着工人来了，大家七手八脚很快就修好了炼钢炉。过去黄海制铁所的炼钢炉进行一次中修要十天到十五天，现在只要六、七天就行了。
    今天在朝鲜，不仅是一个厂内的工人互相帮助，各个工厂之间也展开了共产主义的大协作。为了早日实现农业机械化，以岐阳拖拉机工厂为中心，朝鲜的各个机械厂进行了生产拖拉机的大协作。岐阳拖拉机工厂制造拖拉机的主要部件，熙川机床厂、云山工具厂等许多厂则为它制造变速箱、螺丝等各种零件，这些工厂的工人们革新技术，努力生产，保证及时生产出质量良好的零件送到岐阳拖拉机工厂。在千里马运动中，朝鲜各机械厂还用各种大协作的办法生产出了过去认为朝鲜自己不能制造的整套高炉设备、大型的轧钢设备。最近以龙城机械厂为中心协作制造五千瓩的水轮机已经制成。
    不仅在工业部门以内，而且工厂和农业社之间也在实行互助。朝鲜北部普遍地实行了厂社挂钩的制度，工厂帮助农业社促进农业机械化的实现，农业社则帮助工厂解决副食品菜蔬等问题。不用讲重工业的大工厂为农业社生产了电动机、抽水机等各种机械，就连平壤烟草工厂这样的轻工业工厂的工人，也利用星期日和下班以后的时间，展开了一个每人拣一百公斤废铁的运动，以后又自己动手打造了二千三百多件铁锹、锄头等农具，送给平壤郊区的三石农业社。
    朱成一和他周围的人们
    今天在朝鲜到处流传着龙城机械厂的旋工朱成一帮助后进的故事。
    朱成一是一个二十四岁的像小老虎一样的工业战线上的青年闯将，他和本班的青年们创造了多刀多刃的切削工具和高速切削法，把切削效率提高了五、六倍，在去年争取到了“千里马作业班”的光荣称号。但是他并不以此为满足，他牢牢地记着金日成首相的教导：“革新运动不是局限一个人或几个人，而是在广大的群众中展开；不仅是一个人成为英雄而是应该很多的人成英雄。”这样，他就在每天完成了自己的生产计划以后，又拿出四个小时去帮助别的作业班。他把自己的高速切削法教给十六个作业班，还帮他们制造了一百多件先进的工具和卡具，另外还帮助别的作业班班长作思想工作。过去，这些作业班有的完不成生产计划，现在都成了先进的作业班。朱成一还想尽各种方法加速提高周围的人们的技术。他带领的一个徒工只用了四十天就成为一个能独立工作的旋工了。这个名叫金宝学的初中毕业的小伙子一来到朱成一这里给他当助手，朱成一就像哥哥待弟弟一样，同他一块劳动，一块吃饭，一块睡觉，利用各种空闲的时间为他讲解技术。有时金宝学半夜里提出一个疑问，朱成一就连夜带着他到车间里机床前帮他解答。结果创造了四十天培养一个技工的奇迹。
    帮助别人简直成了朱成一的职业和爱好。有一天，朱成一接到韩熙永的来信。韩熙永原来是他班上的工人，现在上了机械专门学校，他要借阅朱成一的一本目前买不到的“机床制造学”。这本书是朱成一的一“宝”，三年来天天不离手。但是为了别人学习技术理论的需要，朱成一就买了一本笔记本连夜自己把书上的要点抄下来，然后把他的这一“宝”送给了韩熙永。朱成一就是这样，为了别人的进步，自己肯承担任何的牺牲。因此，人们称赞他说：“在朱成一周围没有落后的人”。
    朱成一已成为一面光辉的旗帜，目前在“以共产主义的精神来工作、学习、生活”的口号下，投入“千里马作业班”运动的五、六千个先进集体和十几万工人，都以朱成一为榜样，积极帮助和带动大家争取共同的进步。
    一个仓库管理员的故事
    复员军人金容哲在咸镜南道端川担任商业系统批发站的仓库管理员，这是一种最平凡的职务。但是，如果你听听他的故事，你就会看到，在朝鲜的商业职工们身上，共产主义的思想开出了多么灿烂的花朵。
    金容哲是在去年春天复员后被分配到这个岗位上来的。作为一个仓库管理员，他作了一切应该做的事情：他一接手很快就克服了仓库里的混乱现象，用卡片把三千多种商品登记起来，把仓库管理得有条不紊。在下着暴雨的深夜里，他跑到仓库来看房顶有没有漏水，他利用废纸作成包货纸，利用破草袋作成捆货绳，把运输途中弄坏了的儿童玩具等商品修补起来再卖出去。他还创造各种保管货物的方法：怎样使雪花膏不干，使玻璃镜框避免破碎等。
    金容哲所作的，并不仅仅是这些。今年春天，金容哲听到一个从灵山农业社来运送货物的老人说：现在农村缺少犁铧，如果有犁铧就能提高春耕的效率。他立刻给各地的农具工厂写信，各工厂很快就制造了大批的犁铧送来，及时满足了农业生产上的需要。
    金容哲一有空就往各商店里跑，去看日用品销售的情况，这在他已经成了习惯。有一天，他看到许多顾客要买小镜子，但商店却缺货，仓库里也没有，把售货员急得没有办法，金容哲立刻跑到端川木材加工生产合作社，商量做小镜子的问题。合作社说没有玻璃不能做，金容哲马上跑回仓库，从卖玻璃剩下的破玻璃块中挑出了三箱能够做小镜的玻璃，给合作社送了去。过了几天，合作社就做出一千个小镜子，送到商店里，满足了顾客的要求。
    金容哲还是一个严格的商品检查员，每一批货发到他的仓库里，他就检查它的质量。有一次发来了清津五金工厂生产的钢笔尖，他发现太硬太尖，老是划破纸。他就给清津五金工厂写信，要他们提高质量。有一次发来的玩具和鞋刷的质量不好，他马上就到生产这些货物的端川荣军日用品工厂去，同他们研究如何提高质量，结果促进了工厂产品质量的提高，又使顾客们满意。
    像金容哲一样，今天朝鲜的商业战线上的职工们，都是一心为了顾客，一切为了人民。农村里的商业职工，农忙时背上应时货物到田野里去，及时满足群众的需要。平壤西区百货商店荣获“千里马”作业班称号的金春英售货小组，每当顾客来买的货物缺货或花色品种不合要求时，她们就记下顾客的地址，然后千方百计地弄到顾客需要的货物送上门去，或邮寄给他们。仅在四个月当中，她们就这样为顾客解决了一千多件商品。记者最近访问了平壤车站前的一家食品商店，这家商店在附近的住宅大楼的每一层楼梯口都设了一个木箱，职工们忙于生产和工作，没有时间自己到商店买菜，只要写一张纸条投进木箱，注明买什么菜，什么时间送到多少号住宅，到时候商店的职工就把做好的菜给他送到饭桌上。这家商店的经理柳粉女说：现在妇女们也都跨上千里马参加了社会主义建设，我们要保证他们吃好，不管怎么麻烦、怎么困难，我们都担起来。
    共产主义的幼苗
    今年7月2日，在黄海南道碧城郡院坪里，发生了一件十三岁的儿童金日洙舍己救人的动人事迹。这一天，金日洙从一条河边走过，忽然听到“成俊快淹死了”的呼救声。他立即跑过去，原来这里有三个小孩在河边洗手，一个叫吴成俊的八岁的儿童被水冲到深处去了。金日洙看到这种情况，立刻跳下水，抢救被淹的孩子。他虽然会游泳，但是因为人小气力不足，加上水又急，带着被救的孩子接连被淹没了八次，眼看快要游到岸边又被水冲走了。最后，他用尽力气，把吴成俊推上了岸，但他自己却再也没有力气上来了。为了救别人，金日洙牺牲了自己的生命。
    共产主义的思想品质，在少年儿童们的身上生长得特别快。今天的朝鲜少年儿童，都是那么热爱劳动，热爱集体，团结互助。在春天植树的季节里，朝鲜北部到处都会看到一队队的红领巾开上山坡，植造“少年林”。在夏天干旱的时候，少年儿童们又成群结队地顶着盆、提着桶去帮助农民伯伯抗旱。在平壤到南浦的铁路线上，奔跑着一列绿色的客车。列车的每一节车厢上，都有三个大字：“少年号”。谁坐上了这列列车。都为孩子们热爱劳动的品质所感动，原来这列列车从火车头到车厢，都是朝鲜的少年儿童在执行自己的小五年计划中用养兔子、种向日葵、拣废铁等劳动换来的钱购买的。今年，少年儿童们又用同样的方法买了三十台拖拉机送给农民。在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府阳光、雨露的滋养下，这些共产主义的幼苗正在飞快地成长起来。
