    "Our Backbone is Stronger!"
    By Our Correspondents Yu Yang and Cheng Pu

    At the end of July, we visited the San Shi Li Pu People's Commune in Jin County, Lüda City. With the vigorous support of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant and other units, this commune is advancing rapidly along the road of technological transformation. Here, we saw how the actions of various sectors in supporting agriculture over the past six months have blossomed and borne fruit in the countryside.

    Good Crops Everywhere

    Traveling through the green fields of the San Shi Li Pu Commune, one can see large patches of sturdy and tall corn, straight and tidy sorghum, and millet and foxtail millet with large ears, all growing lush and dark green. Whether in the plains or the mountains, good crops of a single color are everywhere. The commune members happily say, "This year's crops are simply growing out of this world!"

    In the Taizi Brigade in the eastern mountainous area, Commune Party Secretary Dong Changde and Brigade Branch Secretary Wang Xuejian took us to Xishan Ridge to look at the crops. The millet and foxtail millet on the hillside there were taller than people. Comrade Wang Xuejian smiled and held up the plump ears of millet, saying, "Who has ever seen such good millet growing in this kind of land!" Originally, this was a very barren sandy land, with a thin layer of soil over weathered rock.

    "Why can such good crops grow on such barren land?"

    "This is thanks to the chemical fertilizer made by the commune!" Comrade Wang Xuejian probably saw our surprise and immediately explained.

    Speaking of chemical fertilizer, the commune members are very grateful to the Dalian Chemical Plant. This year, with the direct support of this plant, the San Shi Li Pu Commune developed its own chemical fertilizer industry. Every day, the commune's trucks go to the Dalian Chemical Plant to transport back ammonia water and sulfuric acid mother liquor, which are then processed into inexpensive ammonium sulfate by the commune's chemical fertilizer workshop using local methods. So far, the commune's chemical fertilizer plant has produced 800 tons of various chemical fertilizers using local methods. This year, the commune's more than 50,000 mu of crops are using more than twice as much fertilizer as last year. Therefore, even the barren mountain slopes of the Taizi Brigade are growing strong and good crops.

    Major Victory in Pest Control

    The commune's small chemical plant is not only a production base for high-quality chemical fertilizers, but also an arsenal for people to fight against diseases and insect pests. The various agents manufactured by the plant's pesticide workshop have played a significant role in this year's pest control efforts. Not long after the start of summer weeding, when the millet seedlings were only a foot tall, the millet fields of the San Shi Li Pu Commune suddenly suffered from cutworms. Some people counted as many as fifteen or sixteen larvae on one millet seedling. These insects are very ferocious, and after they grow up, they can eat up large areas of crops overnight. However, as soon as the insects appeared, the commune issued an alarm to all the brigades and immediately sent the pesticides made by the commune itself to the brigades. Men, women, old and young, all worked together, and wherever there were insects, they sprayed the medicine. The young men vigorously sprayed the medicine with atomizers, while the women and children dipped brushes in basins of pesticide and sprinkled it on the crops. In a few days and nights, the cutworms in the commune's 20,000 mu of millet and sorghum fields were wiped out. Everyone said: The pesticide made by the commune is really effective!

    The development of the pesticide industry in the San Shi Li Pu Commune is the result of scientific work serving production. After the Party issued the call to strengthen support for agriculture, the Lüda City Agricultural Science Research Institute "linked up" with the San Shi Li Pu Commune, sending staff to the commune's chemical plant to help them establish a pesticide workshop. This enabled the workshop to quickly manufacture 223 emulsifiable concentrate and 666 powder using local methods. They also used wild wolfsbane to produce a pesticide called "Wolfsbane Liquid." In just May and June, they produced more than four tons of various pesticides, ensuring the needs of the entire commune's fruit trees and field crops for disease and pest control.

    Taking Advantage of the "East Wind" to Vigorously Reform Tools

    During our visit to the San Shi Li Pu Commune, when asked what the main characteristics of this year's agricultural production were, the commune comrades replied: Early. Because it was early, field production was proactive and victorious at every stage. This spring, the entire commune completed 1.2 million cubic meters of earthwork and stonework for water conservancy projects one month ahead of schedule, and completed the spring sowing task half a month earlier than in previous years. Because the planting was early, as soon as the summer weeding stage arrived, they hoed and cultivated repeatedly to prevent weeds from growing rampant during the rainy season. Good crops this year are also an important reason. The reason why agricultural production can be ahead of schedule at every step is mainly due to the vigorous efforts in tool reform, in addition to other factors. "Resolutely oppose lying on the body of national large-scale industry waiting for foreign machines; take advantage of the favorable east wind of industrial support for agriculture, combine indigenous and foreign methods, vigorously carry out tool reform, and accelerate agricultural technological transformation!" This is an important experience that the commune leaders repeatedly mentioned. Since the beginning of this year, under the guidance of this thought, a mass tool reform movement has been launched. In less than half a year, the reform of tools for water conservancy construction, crop cultivation, agricultural and sideline product processing, pig raising, and cooking has been completed. This has enabled mechanized operation to reach 10% and semi-mechanized operation to reach 75%.

    The victory of tool reform is also inseparable from the fraternal support of the industrial sector. In this regard, there are two things that are particularly widely praised by the cadres and commune members of the commune. The first is "sending charcoal in the snow." At the beginning of the tool reform, the commune lacked iron and coke. At this time, the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant sent coke and iron materials. This greatly moved the commune members. Some said: "If the factory supports us like this, and we don't do a good job in production this year, we will be letting down the Party and Chairman Mao, and we will also be letting down the working class elder brothers!" The stoves that had been shut down due to lack of fuel were rekindled, and people's enthusiasm for reforming tools was also burning like a fire. The second thing is the "multi-purpose use" of diesel engines. The major brigades of the San Shi Li Pu Commune had 26 diesel engines. In the past, one diesel engine could only drive one working machine. The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant decided to help the commune realize the comprehensive utilization of diesel engines. The plant sent technicians and workers, and sent shafts and pulleys specially processed for installing the machines. The Dalian Cement Plant also sent cement for installing irrigation and drainage machinery. With the support of all parties and their own efforts, the "multi-purpose use" of diesel engines was quickly realized. One diesel engine could simultaneously drive three machines: a straw cutter, a feed grinder, and a flour mill. Most of the commune's grain and feed processing has been mechanized. Women no longer have to revolve around the millstone, and people who used to be sore and tired from cutting straw can now stand up straight. Chen Xuelian, an elderly commune member of the vegetable team, happily said after seeing the "multi-purpose use" of the diesel engine: "In the future, we must grow vegetables well so that the worker brothers can eat more vegetables and make more machines for us!"

    "Our Backbone is Stronger!"

    "With the magic weapon of the People's Commune, and now with the direct support of national industry, our backbone for developing agriculture is even stronger!" This is a sentence that the commune members of the San Shi Li Pu Commune like to say. This sentence speaks to the significance of industrial support for agriculture, and it is also a summary of their effect from industrial support over the past six months.

    In the San Shi Li Pu Commune, we visited the agricultural machinery repair and assembly plant there with great interest. This is the industrial base for the commune to realize agricultural technological transformation. Comrade Sun Dezhen, director of the Commune Industry Office, who guided us on the visit, told us: Six months ago, this factory only had a few red stoves and two old lathes. Production mainly relied on manual operation and could only manufacture small farm tools such as sickles and hoe blades. However, the factory in front of us is no longer the same as it was six months ago. With the help of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant in many ways, this agricultural machinery repair and assembly plant has basically realized mechanized production. The original red stove was expanded into a forging workshop and two board hammers were installed. The blacksmiths who originally swung sledgehammers can now operate the board hammers to impact forgings. Not only is the efficiency high, but also larger agricultural machinery parts can be forged. The machining workshop, which originally had only two old lathes, now has a planer, a drilling machine, and five lathes, and can perform general metal cutting processing. Now, the agricultural machinery repair and assembly industry of the San Shi Li Pu Commune has laid a good foundation. The commune's automobiles, diesel engines, tractors, and other agricultural machinery can basically achieve "major repairs without leaving the commune, and minor repairs without leaving the team." In the first half of this year, the commune's machinery repair and assembly plant has produced more than 7,100 new tools, and is now starting to manufacture autumn harvest tools for the major brigades.

    The improvement of mechanical repair and manufacturing capabilities has also enabled the commune's other industries to begin to be armed. Now, a newly built small and simple motor repair and manufacturing plant has started operation and has produced the first small motor. The chemical plant is being expanded with the help of the Chemical Research Institute of the Lüda City Heavy Industry Bureau and other units, so that in addition to producing more chemical fertilizers and pesticides, it can also use agricultural and sideline products to produce other chemical products. With the help of national industrial departments and scientific research departments, the commune's backbone is becoming "stronger and stronger," and it has more and more agricultural machinery, chemical products, and building materials. This will enable the San Shi Li Pu Commune to gradually realize agricultural mechanization, electrification, and water conservancy.

    “咱们的腰杆子更硬啦”
    本报记者　于羊　程浦
    7月末，我们访问了旅大市金县三十里堡人民公社。这个公社在大连机车车辆厂等单位的大力支援下，沿着技术改造的道路大步前进。在这里，我们看到半年来各行各业支援农业的行动，已经在农村中开花结果。
    遍地好庄稼
    穿行在三十里堡公社绿色的原野上，到处可见大片粗壮、高大的玉米，挺拔整齐的高粱，以及甩着大穗头的谷子、糜子，样样长得青里透黑。不论平原和山区，到处都是青一色的好庄稼。社员们高兴地说：“今年的庄稼简直长到地外边去啦！”
    在东部山区的台子大队，公社党委书记董长德同志和大队支部书记王学俭同志带我们去西山岗上看了一阵子庄稼。那里山坡上的谷子和糜子长得比人还高。王学俭同志笑眯眯地捧起那肥硕的谷穗说：“过去谁见过这种地长出这样的好谷子！”原来这是一块很瘠薄的沙土地，薄薄的土层下面就是风化了的岩石。
    “这样贫瘠的地土为什么能长出这么好的庄稼呢？”
    “这是公社造的化学肥料的功啊！”王学俭同志大概看出了我们很惊奇，立刻解释说。
    提起化肥，社员们非常感谢大连化工厂。今年三十里堡公社在这个厂的直接支援下，发展了公社的化肥工业，每天都有公社的大卡车去大连化工厂运回氨水和硫酸母液，然后由公社化工厂的化肥车间用土法加工成廉价的硫酸铵。到现在，公社化工厂已经用土法生产了八百吨各种化肥。今年全社五万多亩庄稼，使用的化肥比去年增加一倍以上。所以，连台子大队那样贫瘠的山坡地也生长出茁壮的好庄稼。
    灭虫大捷
    公社的这座小小的化工厂不但是优质化肥的生产基地，还是人们与病虫害作斗争的武器库呢。这个厂的农药车间制造的各种药剂，在今年的防治虫害中发挥了很大的作用。夏锄开始不久，谷子苗还只有一尺来高，三十里堡公社的谷子地忽然起了夜盗虫。有人数了数，一棵谷苗上最多的有十五六只幼虫。这种虫子很凶，长成之后，一夜之间就会把大片庄稼啃个精光。但是，虫子一出现，公社就向各大队发出警报。立即把公社自己造的农药送到各大队。男女老少齐动手，哪里有虫，就往哪里撒药。小伙们猛劲地用喷雾器打药，妇女和孩子们就用刷帚沾着盆里的药水往庄稼上洒。几个昼夜的功夫，全公社两万亩谷子和高粱地的夜盗虫被消灭得干干净净。人人都说：公社造的农药真有劲！
    三十里堡公社农药工业的发展，是科学工作为生产服务的结果。当党发出了加强支援农业的号召以后，旅大市农业科学研究所就与三十里堡公社“挂上了钩”，派工作人员去公社化工厂，帮助他们建立了农药车间，使这个车间很快能用土法制造二二三乳剂、六六六粉，还用野生狼毒草制成了一种名叫“狼毒液”的农药。仅仅5、6两月就生产了各种农药四吨多，保证了全公社果树和大田作物防治病虫害的需要。
    “借东风”大闹工具改革
    访问三十里堡公社过程中，问起今年农业生产的主要特点是什么，公社的同志们回答说：是早。因为早，就使田间生产步步主动，节节胜利。全公社今春提前一个月完成了一百二十万土石方的水利工程；较往年提前半月完成了春播任务。因为种的早，夏锄阶段一到，就一遍跟着一遍地铲趟，防止了雨季草荒。今年庄稼好，这也是一个重要原因。农业生产上所以能步步赶先，除了其他因素以外，主要是由于大抓了工具改革。“坚决反对躺在国家大工业的身上等待洋机器；要借工业支援农业的大好东风，土洋结合，大搞工具改革，加速农业技术改造！”这是公社领导同志一再谈到的一条重要经验。今年年初以来，在这个思想指导下，掀起了群众性的工具改革运动。不到半年，就完成了水利施工、农作物栽培、农副产品加工、养猪、炊事等工具的成套改革。使机耕作业达到10％，半机械作业达到75％。
    工具改革的胜利也是与工业部门的兄弟般的支援分不开的。在这方面，有两件事特别为公社的干部和社员们普遍传颂着。第一件是“雪里送炭”。在工具改革开始的时候，公社缺铁、缺焦炭。这时大连机车车辆厂送来了焦炭和铁材。这事使社员们大受感动。有的说：“工厂这样支援我们，今年的生产要是搞不好，对不起党和毛主席，也对不起工人阶级老大哥！”因缺少燃料而停火的烘炉又燃起火来，人们改革工具的热情也一团火似地燃烧起来了。第二件事是柴油机“一机多用”。三十里堡公社各大队有二十六台柴油机，过去一台柴油机只能带动一台工作机械。大连机车车辆厂决定帮助公社实现柴油机综合利用。厂里派来了技术人员和工人，送来了专门加工好的安装机器所用的轴杠和皮带轮。大连水泥厂也送来了安装排灌机械用的水泥。各方面的支援加上自己的努力，很快就实现了柴油机“一机多用”，使一台柴油机能同时带动铡草、饲料粉碎、磨面三种机器，全公社的粮食和饲料加工大部分实现了机械化。妇女们再也不用围着磨台转了，过去为铡草累得腰酸膀子痛的人现在可以直起腰来了。蔬菜队的老年社员陈学廉看过柴油机的“一机多用”后，欢喜地说：“以后可得把菜种好，让工人兄弟吃到更多的菜，好多造机器给咱们！”
    “腰杆子更硬啦”
    “有了人民公社这个法宝，如今又有了国家工业的直接支援，咱们发展农业的腰杆子就更硬啦！”这是三十里堡公社社员们喜欢说的一句话。这句话道出了工业支援农业的意义，也是他们对半年来工业支援的效果的概括。
    在三十里堡公社，我们以很大的兴趣参观了那里的农业机械修配厂。这是公社实现农业技术改造的工业基础。引我们参观的公社工业办公室主任孙德珍同志告诉我们：半年以前，这个工厂还只有几盘红炉和两台旧车床，生产主要靠手工操作，只能制造镰刀、锄板之类的小农具。可是，现在呈现在我们眼前的这座工厂已不是半年前的模样了。经过大连机车车辆厂多方面的帮助，这个农业机械修配厂已经基本上实现了机械化生产。原来的红炉扩大成锻造车间，还装上了两台夹板锤。原来抡大锤的打铁工人，现在只要操纵夹板锤，就可以冲击锻件。不仅效率高，而且可以锻造较大的农业机械部件。原来只有两台旧车床的机械加工车间，现在有了刨床、钻床和五台车床，一般的金属切削加工都能进行。现在三十里堡公社的农业机具修配工业已打下良好的基础。公社的汽车、柴油机、拖拉机和其他农业机械，基本上做到了“中修不出社，小修不出队”。今年上半年，公社的机械修配厂已经生产了七千一百多件新式工具，现在又开始为各大队制造秋收工具。
    机械修配和制造能力的提高，使公社的其他工业也开始得到武装。现在，新建的一座小型的简易电机修配制造厂已经开工，并且生产出了第一台小型电动机。化工厂正在旅大市重工业局化工研究所等单位的帮助下进行扩建，使它除生产更多的化肥和农药外，还能利用农副产品生产其他化工产品。在国家工业部门和科学研究部门的帮助下，公社的腰杆子“越来越硬”，它拥有的农业机械、化工产品、建筑材料也就越来越多。这就可以使三十里堡公社逐步实现农业机械化、电气化和水利化。
