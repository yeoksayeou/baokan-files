    The "Democratic Party" Reactionary Upper Clique Seizes Power by Base Means
    South Korean People Continue to Struggle Against the Phony Election
    Seoul Citizens Demonstrate in Front of the Puppet National Assembly Demanding that Reactionary Assemblymen Get Out

    (Dispatch from Seoul) The "Democratic Party" reactionary upper clique, having seized a "majority of votes" through despicable deceptive means in the South Korean puppet "National Assembly election," is about to make its appearance under the wing of its American masters, despite the South Korean people's strong calls against the phony election.

    Since the South Korean puppet "National Assembly election" began on July 29, people from all over South Korea have held marches and demonstrations to oppose the phony election. The schedule for the South Korean puppet election has been repeatedly disrupted. According to an announcement on August 1 by the puppet "Central Election Committee," thirteen "National Assembly" electoral districts had to hold new "elections," in which as many as 450 "ballot boxes" were burned by the people. Among them, ten electoral districts were scheduled to hold new "elections" on August 15, while the "elections" in three counties in Gyeongsangnam-do would be postponed indefinitely. Nevertheless, the "Democratic Party" reactionary upper clique, which claimed to have "won a majority of seats" in this puppet election, held a joint inauguration ceremony of the puppet "National Assembly" on the 8th under the direction of US imperialism, announcing the official assumption of office by the "assembly members," and decided to convene a five-day joint session of the puppet "National Assembly" from the 15th to elect a new "President," and then have the new "President" appoint a "Prime Minister" to form a formal new puppet "cabinet" to replace Syngman Rhee.

    However, the South Korean people resolutely refuse to recognize this deceptive "election." On the 8th, Seoul citizens broke through the police line in front of the puppet "National Assembly" to protest the phony election and the convening of the puppet "National Assembly." Students from the southern suburbs of Seoul wrote slogans in blood, demanding "Counter-revolutionary assemblymen get out!" At present, the new wave of struggle of the South Korean people aroused by the phony election is still continuing.

    In another dispatch, the South Korean "Democratic Party" reactionary upper clique, immediately upon taking office, begged US imperialism for "aid," once again exposing its servile features. The "Democratic Party" leader Chang Myon demanded that the United States maintain its annual "grants" to South Korea at at least $200 million as "economic aid," and demanded an immediate "grant" of $30 million to tide over the financial crisis facing the South Korean puppet regime.

    “民主党”反动上层集团用卑鄙手法窃取政权
    南朝鲜人民继续斗争反对伪选
    汉城市民到伪国会前示威要反动议员滚蛋
    本报讯　汉城消息：在南朝鲜伪“国会选举”中用卑鄙的欺骗手段窃取了“多数票”而成为执政党的“民主党”反动上层集团，不顾南朝鲜人民反对伪选的强烈呼声，在美国主子的卵翼下即将袍笏登场。
    自从7月29日南朝鲜伪“国会选举”开始以来，南朝鲜各地人民纷纷举行游行示威，反对伪选。南朝鲜的伪选日程就不能不一再被打乱。据伪“中央选举委员会”8月1日宣布，有十三个“民议院”的选区要重新进行“选举”，在这些选区中被人民烧毁的“投票箱”达四百五十个之多。其中十个选区预定于8月15日重新“选举”，而在庆尚南道三个郡的“选举”将无限期推迟。尽管如此，在这次伪选中自称已“获得多数当选”的“民主党”反动上层集团，在美帝国主义的指使下在8日举行伪“国会两院”联合就职仪式，宣布“议员”正式就任，并决定从15日起召开为期五天的伪“国会两院”联席会议选举新“总统”，再由新“总统”任命“总理”，以组成正式替代李承晚的新的傀儡“内阁”。
    但是，南朝鲜人民坚决不承认这种欺骗“选举”。汉城人民在8日冲破伪“国会”前面的警察防线，抗议伪选和伪“国会”开会。来自汉城南郊的学生用血写下口号，要求“反革命议员滚蛋！”目前，由伪选所激起的南朝鲜人民的新的斗争浪潮还在继续中。
    又讯　南朝鲜“民主党”反动上层集团一上台就向美帝国主义乞求“援助”，再一次暴露出了它的奴才嘴脸。“民主党”头目张勉要求美国把对南朝鲜的年度“赠款”维持至少两亿美元作为“经济援助”，并且要求立即“赠给”三千万美元以度过南朝鲜傀儡政权所面临的财政危机。
