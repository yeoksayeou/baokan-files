    Forever Stand with the Korean People
    Huang Zhifu
    August 15th is the day the Korean people gained independence, freedom, and liberation. With immense joy and excitement, I extend brotherly congratulations to the closest Korean people, with whom I fought alongside for many years, and wish the heroic Korean people even more brilliant achievements in socialist construction.
    On the occasion of celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of Korea's liberation, I am reminded of the unbreakable brotherly friendship forged with blood by the Chinese and Korean people, under the correct leadership of the Party, in the war against imperialism, aggression, and in defense of peace.
    Park Jae-geun, the most outstanding soldier of the Korean people, spared no personal life, braved the rain of bullets, and shielded wounded Chinese People's Volunteers with his own body. His great internationalist spirit inspired every officer and soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers. He was a vanguard fighter in the Korean people's anti-American and anti-aggression struggle, and a shining example of the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.
    Luo Shengjiao, the most outstanding son of the Chinese people and a great internationalist fighter, heroically dedicated his precious life for the Korean people and the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. His great internationalist spirit will forever inspire the Chinese and Korean people's enthusiasm for the common struggle against imperialist aggression. He was a good soldier taught by Chairman Mao, his spirit will live forever, and his name will shine forever.
    Park Jae-geun and Luo Shengjiao, their blood was not shed in vain, it won the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, making the long-standing friendship between China and Korea even more consolidated and developed.
    Here, I also recall that when our troops were building barracks in 1956, we lived in the home of an elderly couple, Grandpa and Grandma Li, who were in their seventies. The U.S. imperialists took the lives of their two sons in the war of aggression against Korea. On April 25th, another comrade and I were carrying a large rock weighing over a hundred pounds down the mountain. We accidentally fell halfway down the mountain, and the rock rolled over my waist, causing serious injuries. While I was lying in Grandpa Li's house, the two old people often brought me water and food, and cared for me with warmth. At that time, the construction work was very busy, and in order to help me recover and participate in labor as soon as possible, the old people tried every possible way to help me heal my injuries. Grandpa Li personally climbed up steep cliffs to dig medicinal herbs in the mountains. When I reluctantly left Grandpa's house, I could not restrain my inner gratitude and shed tears.
    The heroic deeds of Park Jae-geun and Luo Shengjiao, and the care and love of the Korean people for us, constantly inspire and spur me on, deepening my hatred for the U.S. aggressors and deepening my love for the Korean people.
    On November 28, 1956, a Korean student named Li Qinghuan accidentally fell into an ice hole in the Imjin River on his way home from school. A sense of responsibility that brooks no delay drove Comrade Lai Heyi, a Communist Party member, and I to immediately jump into the water to rescue him. However, due to being in the water for a long time, my cotton clothes became soaked and weighed me down, and the piercing cold water made my limbs numb. Despite my best efforts, I could not stop myself from gradually sinking. In an instant, I remembered a sentence by Chairman Mao quoted by the instructor when educating us: "We must cherish the Korean people, cherish every mountain, every river, every blade of grass and every tree in Korea." The leader's words, like a warm current, swept through my body and formed a huge force, finally giving me the strength to rescue Li Qinghuan. This was the responsibility that our volunteer soldiers should fulfill, but the Korean people gave me great honor, which made me deeply uneasy.
    Our Chinese People's Volunteers have completely withdrawn to our own country in accordance with the statements of the two governments, for the sake of peace in Asia and the world.
    However, the heinous U.S. bandits, ignoring the strong condemnation of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world, continue to be stationed in South Korea, and are intensifying their efforts to arm the puppet regime in South Korea, antagonizing the Korean people, and undermining the peaceful reunification of Korea.
    Not long ago, the wave of anger among the South Korean people against the U.S. and Syngman Rhee toppled the Syngman Rhee government. And the U.S. imperialist warmonger Eisenhower is still plotting new war conspiracies to cheer up and support his new puppet regime.
    No matter what tricks the U.S. bandits play, no matter what conspiracies they use, they will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat in the face of the united Korean people. We, the Chinese and Korean people, will never forget the monstrous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in the war of aggression against Korea, and we firmly support the Korean people's just struggle to complete the peaceful reunification of their motherland. If the warmongers dare to provoke a new war, we will definitely make them suffer an even more disastrous defeat than they did on the Korean battlefield! (Attached picture)

### 永远和朝鲜人民站在一起

    永远和朝鲜人民站在一起
    黄治富
    “八·一五”，是朝鲜人民获得独立自由解放的日子。我怀着无比喜悦和激动的心情，向曾多年战斗在一起的最亲密的朝鲜人民，致以兄弟般的祝贺，祝英雄的朝鲜人民，在社会主义建设中，取得更加辉煌的成就。
    在庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年的日子里，使我回忆起在战争年代里，中朝两国人民在党的正确领导下，在反帝反侵略保卫和平的战争中，用鲜血凝成的牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊。
    朝鲜人民最优秀的战士朴在根，曾不惜个人的生命，冒着枪林弹雨，以自己的身体掩护中国人民抗美援朝志愿军的伤员，他的伟大国际主义精神，鼓舞了中国人民志愿军的每一个指战员。他是朝鲜人民反美反侵略斗争的先锋战士，是中朝人民友谊的光辉范例。
    中国人民最优秀的儿子、伟大的国际主义战士罗盛教，为了朝鲜人民和中朝人民的友谊，英勇地献出了自己宝贵的生命。他这种伟大的国际主义精神，永远鼓舞着中朝两国人民共同反对帝国主义侵略的斗争热忱。他是毛主席教导的好战士，他的精神永垂不朽，他的名字永放光芒。
    朴在根、罗盛教，他们的血没有白流，换得了抗美援朝战争的胜利，使有着悠久传统的中朝友谊更加巩固和发展了。
    在这里，我还想起1956年我们部队修建营房的时候，住在一个七十多岁的李老大爷老夫妇的家里。美帝国主义在侵朝战争中，夺去了他们两个儿子的生命。4月25日，我和另外一个同志从山上往下抬着一块百多斤重的大石头，走到半山腰的时候，不慎摔倒了，石头从我的腰部滚过去，受伤很重，我躺在李大爷家里，两位老人家经常给我送水送饭，问寒问暖。当时的营建工作很繁忙，老人家为了能使我早日恢复健康，参加劳动，千方百计的设法帮助我治伤，李老大爷亲自爬上悬崖陡壁，到山上去采挖药材。在我恋恋不舍的离开老大爷家的时候，抑制不住内心的感激，竟流下泪来。
    朴在根、罗盛教的英雄事迹，朝鲜人民对我们的关怀与爱戴，时时刻刻在鼓舞着我、鞭策着我，使我更加深了对美国侵略者的仇恨，加深了对朝鲜人民的热爱。
    1956年11月28日，朝鲜的少年学生李清焕，在放学回家的途中，路过临津江，不慎掉入冰窟窿里去。一种不容迟疑的责任感，驱使我和共产党员赖和义同志立刻跳到水里去抢救。但由于在水里的时间较长，棉衣服湿透了，身子加重了，刺骨的凉水，冻得我四肢麻木。尽管我全力挣扎，仍阻止不了渐渐下沉。刹那间，我想起了指导员同志在教育我们的时候引用的毛主席的一句话：“要爱护朝鲜人民，爱护朝鲜的一山一水一草一木”。领袖的话，似一股暖流涌遍全身，形成了巨大的力量，终于使我有了力量救出了李清焕。这是我们志愿军战士应尽的责任，可是，朝鲜人民却给予了我极大的荣誉，使我深感不安。
    我们中国人民志愿军为了亚洲和世界和平，遵照两国政府的声明，已经全部撤回自己的国土。
    然而，万恶的美国强盗，却无视中朝人民和全世界人民的强烈谴责，仍继续驻扎在南朝鲜，并变本加厉，武装南朝鲜的傀儡政权，与朝鲜人民为敌，破坏了朝鲜的和平统一。
    不久前，南朝鲜人民反对美、李的怒潮，冲垮了李承晚政府。而美帝国主义战争贩子艾森豪威尔，为给他的新傀儡政权打气撑腰，还在策划新的战争阴谋。
    不管美国强盗玩弄什么样的花招，使用什么诡计，在团结起来的朝鲜人民面前，必将遭到可耻的失败。我们中朝人民永远不会忘记美帝国主义在侵朝战争中所犯下的滔天罪行，我们坚决支持朝鲜人民为完成祖国和平统一的正义斗争。如果战争贩子胆敢挑起新的战争，我们一定让他遭到比在朝鲜战场上更加惨重的失败！（附图片）
