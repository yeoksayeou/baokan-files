    Cadres and Commune Members Love the Commune Like Home, Diligently and Frugally Immerse Themselves in Hard Work
    Chongqing Mitingzi People's Commune Diligently and Frugally Manages All Undertakings

    (By Our Newspaper) Chongqing’s Mitingzi Urban People’s Commune cadres and the broad masses of commune members love the commune like home, are diligent and frugal, and immerse themselves in hard work. Within a short four months of establishing the commune, they have managed various production endeavors very well.

    The commune has not asked the state for a single cent or a single complete machine. Entirely relying on the cadres and commune members starting from scratch, working practically and diligently, the number of factories has increased from the original seventeen to more than one hundred and twenty, with nearly three thousand employees. From April to July, the total industrial output value reached more than 9 million yuan, equivalent to 6.4 times the total industrial output value of the entire region last year. The variety of products produced has increased from the original one hundred to more than six hundred. The commune has established a number of backbone factories, such as electromechanical, marine engine repair, chemical, and ribbon factories, which can produce motors, welding machines, welding rods, reversing switches, aviation lamp transformers, ammonia water, agricultural fertilizer, and many daily necessities. Nurseries, public canteens, and living service stations in the residential areas have become complete sets and networks.

    This commune has more than 30,000 urban working people and workers' families. Originally, there were only a few street factories, and there was not much production. The fact that the entire commune has been able to change its appearance in just a few months is inseparable from the fact that all cadres set an example and worked diligently and frugally with the commune members. All cadres in the commune, from the Party Committee Secretary and the Commune Director to the cadres of various grassroots production units, not only take the lead in going to the front line of production, but also eat in the street public canteens and share weal and woe with the commune members. In the early days of the commune's establishment of factories, the machine repair factory only had a dilapidated lathe with "incomplete limbs" that could not be started, and very few tools, which caused great difficulties in production. He Yufu, the secretary of the commune Party committee, and Liu Chaorong, the director of the commune, went deep into the factory and took the lead in making and assembling things themselves with the commune members. He Yufu and Liu Chaorong also led all the fitters, bench workers, and forgers in the factory to work together, separately going to the scrap steel piles of large factories to find scrap steel and broken blower shells. They engaged in production during the day and all the workers in the factory engaged in innovation at night. If there was no steel to make frames or no cement to pour bases, the commune members found wood and slate to replace them. In this way, after the joint hard work of the leading cadres and commune members, this "poor stick" machine repair factory already had six lathes, planers, punches, and blowers. These machines then manufactured many tools and machines to arm themselves. Originally, it could only produce small hardware such as boat nails and screws, but now it can process mine drills and winches for the country, and has trial-produced welding machines, motors, transformers, etc., and has become a backbone factory of the commune. Influenced by the leading role of the commune cadres, Yu Chengzhen, Jiang Lixiao, Ai Yingying and other members of the Communist Youth League used their spare time to carry stones, build sheds, and build stoves, and used old iron pots to set up a youth chemical factory, producing a lot of chemical products, which has now become a medium-sized factory of the entire commune. Under the lead of commune cadres, factories were set up one after another. Almost all of the commune's more than 100 factories are the result of the hard work of the commune cadres and the masses. Many of the factory directors of the commune's factories have learned the skills of managing enterprises and production techniques in a short period of time. They love the factory like home and carefully manage administrative affairs. Because of their diligent and down-to-earth work, they have a great influence on the commune members.

    Under the leadership of the commune Party committee, the broad masses of commune members have set high aspirations and great ambitions, and everyone is working hard to create a happy working life. Four female commune members used the courtyard as a workshop, and set up a small hardware factory with a broken bellows, a pair of pliers, and a hammer. On the first day of work, only half a catty of boat nails were produced. Then, the Party Committee Secretary helped them find old lathes, planers, and winding machines from other factories, and the number of workers increased to more than twenty. From then on, all the workers in the factory had more confidence. Under the guidance of retired old worker Liu Guoan, many people quickly mastered the technology. One day, this small factory received the task of repairing the boiler of the No. 403 tugboat. The workers were both surprised and delighted, and held a Zhuge Liang meeting to "diagnose" the boiler. After seven days of practical and hard work, with the help of workers from nearby ship repair factories, the task was finally completed. Now, this small factory not only produces 30 kinds of parts and accessories needed on ships, but also undertakes medium and small repairs of ships, and has been officially named the Marine Engine Repair Factory by the commune. The story of the Marine Engine Repair Factory, which started from scratch, has further inspired the determination of commune members and cadres to work hard. In the early days of setting up the factory, many people ate at home and worked for the commune. They not only did not take wages from the factory, but also took out part of their savings to purchase supplies for the factory, to build the commune and develop production. In the process of setting up factories, the cadres and commune members of the entire commune tried their best to collect the city's waste materials, refitting what could be refitted and repairing what could be repaired. According to statistics from seven factories, there are currently more than 130 sets of indigenous and simple equipment, which guarantees production.

    After a large number of factories and collective welfare undertakings were established, the broad masses of commune members had even greater confidence in changing the old outlook. They continued to carry forward the revolutionary spirit and break through the technical and raw material barriers. There were very few technical workers in the entire commune. In order to change this situation, the commune sent a group of commune members to large factories to learn technology. The workers in the production posts also worked hard and painstakingly studied technology. Originally, there was only one electrician in the machine repair factory. After a short period of training and teaching, the number of workers in the entire factory who understood machine repair technology increased to more than 40, and the production technology level of the entire factory was also greatly improved. After the number of factories in the entire commune increased sharply, in order not to increase the consumption of raw materials by the state, the broad masses of commune members widely sought out production methods and made full use of urban waste products, waste materials, and scraps from large factories. They produced whatever materials they had, doing everything possible to increase the wealth of the country. No factory complained about the difficulty of lacking raw materials, and no one reached out to the state for raw materials. They used scrap iron and steel to produce boat nails. They processed the waste cotton from large factories, the purchased rags, and waste shoes into machine cleaning brushes, stitched them into children's clothing, and made them into shoe soles. Many light industrial factories, such as the ribbon factory, the linen thread factory, the waste cloth factory, the grass parts factory, and the yarn spinning factory, also opened red furnace workshops and forging workshops, using scrap iron and steel to manufacture boat nails, corner nails, scissors, cooking utensils, horseshoe nails, ox horseshoe nails, and other small hardware, turning useless things into useful things and increasing a large amount of wealth for the country.

    The commune Party committee not only attached importance to political and ideological work, but also mobilized the cadres and commune members of the entire commune to establish a system to ensure the implementation of the policy of running the commune diligently and frugally. The commune stipulates that any purchase expenses of more than 50 yuan in each unit need to be approved by the commune, and those of more than 100 yuan must be discussed and determined at the meeting of responsible cadres of the commune. This ensures that as much funds as possible are used for expanded reproduction and that non-productive expenditures are reduced as much as possible. In the first half of this year, more than 90% of the more than 140,000 yuan of funds accumulated by the entire commune were used for production and construction. The entire commune also saved more than 40,000 yuan from other expenses and transferred them to production and construction. Many factories only have the necessary expenses for boiled water, office supplies, and newspaper subscriptions of a few yuan per month. Under the principle of spending less money and doing more things, the commune leaders also paid great attention to the construction of the commune members' welfare undertakings, which was deeply praised by the commune members.

    干部和社员爱社如家克勤克俭埋头苦干
    重庆米亭子人民公社勤俭办一切事业
    本报讯　重庆市米亭子城市人民公社干部和广大社员爱社如家，克勤克俭，埋头苦干，在建社短短四个月内就把各项生产事业办得很出色。
    这个公社没有向国家要过一文线，要过一部完好的机器，全凭干部、社员白手起家，实干苦干，工厂就由原来的十七个发展到一百二十多个，职工近三千人，4月份到7月份工业总产值达到九百多万元，相当于去年全年这个地区所有工业的总产值的六点四倍。生产产品的品种由原来的一百多种增加到六百多种；公社建立了机电、轮机修配、化工、线带等一批骨干工厂，能生产马达、电焊机、电焊条、倒顺开关、航灯变压器、氨水、农肥和许多生活日用品。居民区内的托儿所、公共食堂、生活服务站己成套成网。
    这个公社有三万多城市劳动人民和工人家属，原先只有几家街道工广，没有什么生产事业。全社能在短短几个月中改变面貌，是和全社干部以身作则，和社员群众一道克勤克俭、埋头苦干的作风是分不开的。全社干部从党委书记、社长到各个基层生产单位的干部不仅带头到生产第一线，还都到街道公共食堂搭伙，和社员群众同甘共苦。公社办厂初期，机器修配厂只有一部“四肢不全”的破旧车床，不能开动，工具也极少，生产遇到很大困难。公社党委书记何玉福、社长刘朝荣就深入工厂，带头和社员一道自制、自装。何玉福和刘朝荣还领导全厂车工、钳工、锻工一齐动手，分头到大厂废钢铁堆里去找来废钢、破鼓风机壳子，白天搞生产，晚上全厂职工闹革新，没有钢材做架子、没有水泥浇座子，社员们找来木头和石板代替，就这样，经过领导干部和社员共同苦战，这个“穷棒子”的机器修配厂已经有了六部车床、刨床、冲床、鼓风机；这些机器又制造了许多工具和机具武装了自己。原来只能生产船钉、螺丝等小五金，现在已能为国家加工矿山钻机、卷扬机，试制了电焊机、马达、变压器等，成了公社的一个骨干工厂了。公社干部、共青团员喻成珍、江礼孝、艾英英等利用业余时间抬石头、搭工棚、建炉灶，利用旧铁锅办起了一个青年化工厂，生产了不少化工产品，现在已成为全社的一个中型工厂。在公社干部的带头影响下，工厂一个接一个的办起来，全社一百多个工厂，几乎都是公社干部群众一同辛勤劳动的果实。公社各个工厂的厂长，很多人在短期内学会了管理企业的本领和生产技能。他们爱厂如家，细心管理行政事务。由于他们勤勤恳恳踏踏实实的劳动，对社员影响很大。
    广大社员在公社党委领导下，立大志，树雄心，个个发奋图强，决心创造幸福的劳动生活。四个女社员以院坝为工场，以一个破风箱、一把钳子和一个锤子办起了一个小五金厂。开工第一天只生产了一斤半船钉。接着党委书记又协助她们从别的工厂里找来了破旧车床、刨床、摇丝机，工人增加到二十多名。从此，全厂职工信心更大，在退休老工人刘国安的指导下，许多人很快掌握了技术。有一天这个小厂接到修复403号拖轮锅炉的任务，职工们又惊又喜，召开了诸葛亮会议，对锅炉进行“会诊”。经过七天的实干苦干，在附近轮船修配厂工人帮助下终于完成了任务。现在这个小厂不仅生产船只上需要的三十种零件和配件，而且担负了轮船的中修和小修，正式被公社命名为轮机修配厂。白手起家的轮机修配厂的办厂事迹，更加激发了社员群众和干部艰苦奋斗的决心。在办厂初期，许多人是吃家里的饭，办公社的事，他们不仅不拿工厂工资，还拿出部分积蓄给工厂购置用具，替公社兴家立业，发展生产。在办工厂中，全社干部和社员尽量搜集了城市的废旧物资，能改装的就改装，能修配的就修配。据七个工厂统计，目前已拥有土简设备一百三十多台，保证了生产。
    在大批工厂和集体福利事业办起来后，广大社员立志改变旧面貌的信心更大，他们继续发扬革命干劲，冲破技术关和原材料关。全社原有的技术工人很少，为改变这种状况，公社派出了一批社员到大厂学技术；在生产岗位上的职工也发奋图强，苦苦钻研技术。机器修配厂原来只有一名电工工人，经过短期的培养、传授，现在全厂懂机修技术的工人增加到四十多个，全厂生产技术水平也大大提高。全社工厂数量猛增后，他们为不增加国家原材料的消耗，广大社员广找生产门路，充分利用城市废品、废料和大厂边角材料。有什么材料，生产什么产品，千方百计增加国家财富，改有一个工厂叫喊缺原材料的困难，没有人伸手向国家要原材料。他们利用烂铁废钢生产船钉；把大厂的废棉、收购来的破布、废鞋，经过加工做成擦机器的刷把、拼成童装、做成鞋底。线带厂、麻线厂、废布厂、草件厂、络纱厂等许多轻工业厂也开办了红炉车间、锻工车间，利用烂铁废钢制造船钉、角钉、剪刀、炊具、马铁掌钉、牛铁掌钉等小五金，变无用为有用，给国家增加了大量财富。
    公社党委不仅重视政治思想工作，而且发动全社干部和社员建立了制度，保证了勤俭办社方针的贯彻。公社规定了各单位在五十元以上的购置费用，需要公社批准，一百元以上的还得由公社负责干部会议上讨论确定。这样保证了尽多的资金用到扩大再生产上去，尽量减少非生产性的开支。今年上半年全社积累的十四万多元资金，有90％以上用于生产建设；全社还从其他开支中节约了四万多元，转用到生产建设中。许多工厂每月只有必要的开水费、办公用品、订阅报纸等几元的开支。在少花钱、多办事的原则下，公社领导也很注意社员福利事业的建设工作，深受社员们的赞扬。
