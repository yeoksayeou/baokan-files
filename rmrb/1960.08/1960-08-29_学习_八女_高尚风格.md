    Learning the Noble Style of the "Eight Women"
    Li Zhen, First Secretary of the Liaozhong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Shenyang City
    In Liu’erbu Commune of our county, the heroic deeds of the eight women who started a fertilizer plant have emerged. A mass movement to learn from and catch up with the eight women has been launched in the vast rural areas of Shenyang City and our county. The broad masses of farmers, especially rural youth and women, have drawn tremendous spiritual strength from the noble style of the eight women. They have all expressed that they want to take firm root in the countryside like the eight women, and use their own laboring hands to strive for the construction of a new socialist countryside.

    The idea of Yao Yuzhen and the other eight women to build a new countryside is very valuable. They love agriculture, love the countryside, and love the construction cause of the motherland. They have lofty ideals and great ambitions to completely change the backwardness of the countryside with their own laboring hands, vowing to build the countryside into a beautiful socialist paradise. They listen to the Party's words, and wherever the Party points, they rush. The Party proposes taking agriculture as the foundation, and they firmly take root in the countryside, regarding participation in agricultural production as an extremely glorious and heroic undertaking, and as a promising and successful career. They think day and night about doing a good job in agricultural production and growing more grain. This valuable communist thought should be greatly promoted. Everyone should learn from them well.

    These eight women also possess a persistent revolutionary drive and a fighting spirit of tenacity and fearlessness of difficulties. In the early stages of building the factory, they lacked technology, equipment, materials, and raw materials. In a word, they were poor. However, they were not intimidated by poverty, nor were they frightened by difficulties. On the contrary, the poorer they were, the more revolutionary they became, and they were full of energy. They neither reached out for assistance from above, nor did they sit and wait for support; instead, they actively sought ways to do things well with the spirit of hard work and ingenuity. When the factory was being built and bricks and tiles were lacking, they searched every street and alley, collecting broken bricks and discarded tiles everywhere; when there were no tile workers, they worked hard, one piece of mud and one brick at a time, to build the factory buildings. Their revolutionary spirit is fully in line with the spirit of the Party's general line for socialist construction, which is to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results. To learn from the eight women well, we must learn their revolutionary spirit of facing difficulties head-on and struggling arduously.

    The bold and ambitious eight women are all rural housewives with only three or four years of education, but they have manufactured large quantities of fertilizer and created unprecedented miracles. They are just like newborn calves who are not afraid of tigers; they dare to think, dare to act, and bury themselves in hard work. They learn when they don't know how, and ask when they don't understand, painstakingly researching and tenaciously experimenting. If they fail once, they try a second time, a third time, until they succeed. They mastered the complete set of fertilizer production technology in just a few months. This fact fully demonstrates that the working people can not only master science and technology, but also develop science and technology.

    Now is the era of realizing modern agriculture. Under the leadership of the Party, we must earnestly study the Party's proposed policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, giving priority to the development of heavy industry and the simultaneous development of agriculture at high speed, thereby establishing the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation. We must learn from the advanced thinking of the eight women and their revolutionary spirit of diligent study and perseverance, establish lofty aspirations, and march boldly towards science. We must contribute all our wisdom and strength to accelerate agricultural modernization and build a beautiful new socialist countryside.

    学习“八女”高尚风格
    中共沈阳市辽中县委第一书记　李贞
    我县刘二卜公社，出现了八女办化肥厂的英雄事迹。在沈阳全市和我县广大农村掀起了学八女、赶八女的群众运动。广大农民，特别是农村青年和妇女，从八女的高尚风格中吸取了巨大的精神力量，他们也都纷纷表示，要像八女那样，在农村扎下牢固的根子，用自己的劳动的双手，发愤图强地建设社会主义新农村。
    姚玉珍等八名妇女，建设新农村的思想是十分可贵的。她们热爱农业，热爱农村，热爱祖国的建设事业。她们有远大的理想，有雄心大志，要以自己劳动的双手彻底改变农村的落后面貌，誓把农村建设成为美好的社会主义乐园。她们听党的话，党指到哪里，她们就冲向哪里。党提出以农业为基础，她们就坚定地在农村扎根，把参加农业生产看成是极其光荣而又豪迈的事业，是大有前途、大有出息的事业。她们朝思暮想地要搞好农业生产，多打粮食。这种可贵的共产主义思想，应该大大发扬。我们每个人都应该很好地向她们学习。
    这八女还有一股坚韧不拔的革命干劲和不怕困难的顽强的战斗精神。她们在建厂的初期，缺技术，少设备，缺物资，少原料，一句话，她们穷。可是她们没有被穷吓倒，没有被困难吓住，相反地她们是越穷越革命，干劲十足。她们一不伸手向上要，二不坐等支援；而是积极设法，以苦干巧干的精神把事情办得很好。建厂时缺砖少瓦，她们就找遍大街小巷，到处搜集残砖废瓦；没瓦工，她们就一把泥、一块砖地大干，建起了厂房。她们这种革命的精神，完全符合多快好省党的社会主义建设总路线的精神。我们要很好地学习八女，就是要学习她们那种见困难就上，艰苦奋斗的革命精神。
    胆大志高的八女，都是只有三、四年文化的农村家庭妇女，可是她们制造出大批化肥，并创造了亘古未有的奇迹。她们就是初生之犊不怕虎，就是敢想、敢干，埋头苦干。她们不会就学，不懂就问，刻苦钻研，顽强试验，一次失败，再来第二次，第三次，直到成功为止。她们只用几个月的时间，就掌握了化肥生产的全套技术。这个事实完全可以说明，劳动人民不仅可以掌握科学技术，而且可以发展科学技术。
    现在是实现现代农业的时期，我们要在党的领导下，认真学习党提出的以农业为基础，以工业为主导，优先发展重工业与高速度发展农业同时并举的方针，从而树立起以农业为基础的思想。我们要学习八女先进思想和刻苦钻研、坚韧不拔的革命精神，树雄心，立大志，猛向科学进军。我们要为加速农业现代化，为建设美好的社会主义新农村，贡献出自己的全部智慧和力量。
