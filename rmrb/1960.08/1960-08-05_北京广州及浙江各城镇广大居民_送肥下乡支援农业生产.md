Xinhua News Agency, Beijing—The people of the capital are actively tapping fertilizer sources to support suburban people's communes in expanding the planting of autumn vegetables. In recent days, the amount of manure transported from the city to the suburbs has been increasing daily. In addition to the nearly three thousand tons of manure and garbage collected daily as usual, more than thirty trucks and forty horse-drawn carts are now dispatched daily, fully loaded with manure, to the suburbs.

The fertilizer excavation campaign in Beijing's urban areas is being conducted under the unified command of a special headquarters established by the Municipal People's Committee. Qin An, deputy head of Xicheng District, in order to grasp the pattern of excavating septic tanks, labored with sanitation workers and excavated eight carts of manure in half a day. Sanitation workers throughout the city launched a fertilizer accumulation competition. Shi Chuanxiang, a national advanced producer, led a fertilizer accumulation shock team that has already accumulated sixteen truckloads of fertilizer in their spare time. The sanitation team he belongs to in Chongwen District has increased the efficiency of cleaning toilets by 13% compared to the past. Workers transporting garbage and sweeping roads have also joined the fertilizer accumulation campaign. The city's cart drivers have established a system for collecting horse manure along the way. The staff of the Xuanwu District Cart and Hoisting Cooperative, which started collecting earlier, has installed manure collection boxes on five hundred large carts, and they have already transported 260,000 jin of horse manure to rural areas in the suburbs. Urban people's communes have also assigned special personnel to mobilize residents to actively carry out fertilizer accumulation work.

In order to further expand the scope of the city fertilizer delivery to the countryside on the existing basis, Beijing's leading authorities are organizing relevant factories to produce manure tanker trucks and manure pumping pumps in order to enrich the mechanical power for excavating manure. Some sewage treatment projects being built in accordance with urban construction plans are also being accelerated, so as to provide rural areas with sewage that can be used for irrigation as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou—Guangzhou is launching a citywide movement to accumulate, donate, and send fertilizer to support the countryside. In recent days, teams of workers, government cadres, and neighborhood women have been constantly sending fertilizer to the suburbs. On July 27, a fertilizer delivery team of more than 2,000 people from Taikang, Danan, and Liurong streets in the northern district used trucks, flatbed carts, tricycles, bicycles, handcarts, and motorized junks, dividing into land and water routes, to transport the garbage fertilizer, manure fertilizer, and canal mud accumulated in the past few days to the Sanyuanli Commune in the suburbs. In this blitz of fertilizer accumulation, people actively looked for fertilizer sources during their spare time. More than 200 young cadres from the Guangdong Shipping Department jumped into the Pearl River, where the water was knee-deep, and scooped up the black river mud. More than 100 employees of the Guangzhou Sewerage Company and the Road Company also dug more than 40,000 jin of channel sludge and sent it to the countryside.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou—Towns in Zhejiang Province are sending fertilizer to the countryside to support late rice production. In the first ten days of July alone, nineteen counties and cities accumulated and sent 17,650,000 dan of fertilizer to the countryside.

During the summer harvest and planting, the broad masses of urban people not only participated in the harvest and planting agricultural labor, but also combined the summer patriotic health campaign to launch a mass movement to accumulate fertilizer to support late rice surpassing early rice. In the recent fertilizer accumulation and delivery blitz week in Wenzhou, more than 47,000 person-times were mobilized, accumulating more than 150,000 dan of native miscellaneous fertilizer. In order to achieve simultaneous accumulation and delivery, and rapid accumulation and rapid delivery, urban communes and departments in Ningbo specially organized fertilizer delivery teams to deliver fertilizer to the fields of the linked communes and teams. The industrial and communications and financial and trade systems of this city also deployed more than 70 ships to transport fertilizer day and night. Through fertilizer accumulation and delivery blitz activities, the level of urban sanitation has also been improved. In the Yongkang County sanitation blitz, not only was a large amount of fertilizer accumulated, but also the sewers were cleared, the low-lying areas were filled, and new seepage pits and garbage incineration furnaces were built.

    北京广州及浙江各城镇广大居民
    送肥下乡支援农业生产
    新华社北京讯　首都人民积极挖掘肥源，支援郊区人民公社扩种秋菜。这几天，从城市运往郊区的粪肥逐日增加，除去平常按日收集的近三千吨粪便垃圾以外，现在每天又多出动了三十多部汽车和四十多辆马车，满载着粪肥送往郊区。
    北京城区的挖掘肥源运动，是在市人民委员会特别组成的指挥部统一指挥下进行的。西城区副区长秦安为了掌握掏挖化粪池的规律，他和清洁工人一起劳动，半天就掏了八马车粪肥。全市清洁工人展开了积肥竞赛；全国先进生产者时传祥领导的一支积肥突击队，已经在业余时间积肥十六汽车，他所在的崇文区清洁队，清除厕所粪便的效率比过去提高了13％。运送垃圾、清扫道路的工人也投入了积肥运动。全市的马车工人制订了随车收集马粪的制度，收集工作开始较早的宣武区马车起重社的职工，已经在五百辆大车上安上了接粪箱，他们已把收集到的二十六万斤马粪运到郊区农村。城市人民公社也都抽出专人，发动居民积极开展积肥工作。
    为使城肥下乡的工作，在现有基础上进一步扩大范围，北京市的领导机关正在组织有关工厂生产粪罐汽车和抽粪泵，以便充实掏挖粪便的机械力量。按照城市建设规划修建的一些污水处理工程也在加紧施工，以便尽快地向农村提供能够用来灌溉的污水。
    据新华社广州电　广州市正在掀起一个全民性的积肥、献肥、送肥运动，支援农村。连日来，由工人、机关干部、街坊妇女组成的送肥队伍，不断地把肥料送往郊区农村。7月27日，北区泰康、大南和六榕等街道二千多人的送肥队伍，使用汽车、大板车、三轮车、自行车、手推车和机帆船，分水陆两路，把几天中积集的垃圾肥、粪溺肥、渠坭等肥料送到郊区三元里公社。在这次突击积肥运动中，人们利用工余时间积极找寻肥源。广东航运厅的二百多名青年干部，一下班就跳下水深没膝的珠江边，把黑油油的河泥掏上岸来。广州市下水道公司和道路公司的一百多名职工也挖了四万多斤渠道污泥，送给农村。
    据新华社杭州电　浙江省各城镇送肥下乡支援晚稻生产。仅十九个县、市在7月的头十天，就积肥、送肥一千七百六十五万担下乡。
    在夏收夏种中，广大城镇人民不仅参加了收种的农事劳动，还结合夏季爱国卫生运动开展了积肥支援晚稻超早稻的群众运动。温州市在最近的积肥送肥突击周中，出动了四万七千多人次，积起土杂肥十五万多担。宁波市各城市公社和各部门为了做到边积边送、快积快送，专门组织了送肥队，把肥料送到挂钩社、队的田头。这个市的工交、财贸系统还调配了七十多只船日夜运送肥料。通过积肥送肥突击活动，城镇卫生水平也提高一步。永康县卫生突击运动中，不仅积了大量肥料，还清理了阴沟，填平了洼地，新建了渗水坑和垃圾焚灰炉。
