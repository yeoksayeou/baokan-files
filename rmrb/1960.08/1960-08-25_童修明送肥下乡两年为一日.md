Tong Xiuming, a cotton fluffer at the Yuanfengxiang Flower Mat Shop in Nanjing, keeps a worn-out diary by his side. The first page reads: "Deliver Fertilizer to Support People's Communes in Developing Production!" Inside, it records his year-round achievements in supporting agriculture. From the beginning of 1958 to early August of this year, he has delivered 241,900 jin of manure to the Fenghuang Team of the Jiangdong Commune.

For two years, Tong Xiuming has consistently, proactively, consciously, and persistently delivered fertilizer to the countryside to support agriculture. Whether it is scorching summer heat or freezing winter months, whether it is windy and rainy or icy and snowy, whether it is an ordinary day or a holiday, he always takes the time to carry buckets of manure to the countryside, without interruption.

As early as May 1958, a great leap forward situation emerged in the countryside, and the Party called on urban residents to support agricultural production. Tong Xiuming, who came from a farming background, thought: "Fertilizer is a treasure to farmers, and crops cannot do without it. If we collect the manure in the city and send it to the countryside, that would be great!" So, he spent five yuan to buy a pair of manure buckets and placed them in a small alley outside Hanzhongmen. Since then, in addition to fluffing cotton, Tong Xiuming had another job. Every morning, as the east was just beginning to dawn, he would rush from his home on Mochou Road to outside Hanzhongmen to deliver manure to the Fenghuang Team of the Jiangdong Commune, and then go to work. Over time, delivering fertilizer has become an indispensable part of his life. He said: "If I don't deliver fertilizer for a day, I feel like I haven't done something important, and I can't eat or sleep peacefully."

The members of the Fenghuang Team are very grateful to Tong Xiuming for delivering fertilizer to the countryside every day. An old lady, watching Tong Xiuming's back, said to another member: "This person is obsessed with supporting agriculture."

Before the Spring Festival this year, Tong Xiuming thought that the masses had the habit of removing manure and dumping dirt, which was a good time to collect and deliver fertilizer. He discussed it with Wu Xiancai, a worker in the same shop, and the two decided to work hard on New Year's Eve. When others were reuniting with their families to celebrate the Lunar New Year's Eve, the two of them were enthusiastically delivering fertilizer to the countryside to support agriculture. That night, the two delivered twelve loads of manure to the team, and did not return home to rest until after ten o'clock at night.

During the Spring Festival holiday, he continued to deliver fertilizer to the countryside. Under his influence, the employees of Yuanfengxiang Flower Mat Shop set off a wave of delivering fertilizer to support agriculture. In two days, the entire shop delivered forty or fifty loads of fertilizer, filling the team's manure ponds to the brim. Wu Xiancai has also become an active supporter of agriculture, frequently delivering fertilizer to the countryside.

One snowy night, Tong Xiuming had just finished a meeting in the shop, and he was still thinking about a load of manure that had not been delivered! He walked out of the gate, and gusts of north wind mixed with snowflakes blew in his face. What a cold day! A colleague in the shop kindly advised him not to deliver fertilizer today. Tong Xiuming said: "No, we can't stop supporting agriculture just because it's cold. Delivering one more load of fertilizer today means we can produce more grain tomorrow." He ran to outside Hanzhongmen, picked up the manure buckets, and braved the wind and snow, step by step, towards the Fenghuang Team.

When he returned home after delivering the manure, his wife was awakened. Seeing his face covered with snowflakes and his hands frozen red, she lovingly nagged, "Look at you, you don't even take care of your own body." Tong Xiuming joked, "My body is made of iron, the wind can't blow it, the rain can't penetrate it. What does it matter to suffer a little for building socialism?"

Tong Xiuming is from Hexian County, Anhui Province. He helped people look after cattle from childhood, farmed for more than ten years, and then worked as a cotton fluffer for more than ten years. His enthusiasm for supporting agriculture comes from the education of the Party and a deep understanding of the importance of agricultural production. However, Jin Dama, who lived next door, thought he was doing a "sideline" when she saw him delivering fertilizer so diligently. One day, Jin Dama asked Tong Xiuming, "How much money do you get a month for delivering manure to the countryside every day?" Tong Xiuming smiled and said, "Supporting agriculture is contributing to the entire socialist construction. How can we haggle over money?"

The Fenghuang Team accepted his manure and wanted to give him remuneration, but he refused. The team members also felt bad about it. In March of this year, they sent a silk banner and a good news report to the shop where he worked with gongs and drums. At this time, Tong Xiuming's mood could not calm down for a long time. He excitedly said to the members of the team: "When I pick up the manure buckets, I think of what a responsible comrade of the Municipal Party Committee said when I participated in the city's advanced worker representative conference of the financial and trade system last year: 'Our support for agriculture is to accelerate socialist construction, and it is our duty!' It is with this feeling that I insist on delivering fertilizer every day. Seeing your harvest, I am happier than anything."

    童修明送肥下乡两年为一日
    王维夫
    南京源丰祥花席店弹花工人童修明，身边放着一本破旧的日记本，第一页上写着：“送肥支援人民公社发展生产！”里面记载着他终年支援农业的成绩。从1958年开始到今年8月上旬，他已经给江东公社凤凰小队送了粪肥二十四万一千九百斤。
    童修明两年如一日，主动地、自觉地、持久地坚持送肥下乡，支援农业。不论是烈日酷暑，或是寒冬腊月，不管是刮风下雨，或者是冰天雪地，无论是平常的日子，或是过年过节，他每天总要抽空挑着粪桶送粪便下乡，从不间断。
    早在1958年5月，农村出现了大跃进的形势，党号召城市居民支援农业生产。种田出身的童修明想：“肥是农家宝，庄稼少不了。要是把城里的粪便集起来，送下乡去那该多好！”于是他自己便花了五块钱买了一副粪桶，放在汉中门外一条小巷子里。从此，童修明除了弹棉花外，便多了一份工作。每天早晨，当东方刚刚发白，他就从莫愁路家里赶到汉中门外，把粪便送到江东公社凤凰小队，然后去上工。如此天长日久下去，送肥已成为他生活中不可缺少的一件事。他说：“要是一天不送肥，心里就像有件重要事情没有做，吃饭睡觉也不安心。”
    童修明天天送肥下乡，凤凰小队的社员们都非常感激。有一个老太太望着童修明的背影，对另一个社员说：“这个人支援农业入了迷了。”
    今年春节前夕，童修明想到群众都有除粪倒脏的习惯，这正是积肥送肥的好时机，便和同店的工人吴先才商量了一下，两人决定在三十晚上突击大干一场。当别人正在全家团聚欢度旧历年除夕的时候，他们两人却在起劲地送肥下乡支援农业。这天晚上，两人共送了十二担粪给小队，一直到夜晚十点多钟才回家休息。
    春节假期，他仍坚持送肥下乡，在他的影响下，源丰祥花席店的职工们掀起了送肥支援农业的热潮。两天中，全店共送了四、五十担肥料，把小队的粪池装得满满的。吴先才也成了支援农业的积极分子，经常送肥下乡。
    一个大雪纷飞的夜晚，童修明在店里开会刚结束，心里惦记着还有一担粪没有送哩！他走出大门，一阵阵北风夹着雪花迎面吹来，好冷的天啊！同店的一个职员关心地劝他今天不要去送肥了。童修明说：“不行，支援农业不能因为天冷就不干了。今天多送一担肥，明天就可多增产粮食。”他跑到汉中门外，挑起粪桶，顶着风雪，一步步向凤凰小队走去。
    送完粪回到家里，妻子被他惊醒了，看他满面雪花，两手冻得通红，关心地唠叨说：“看你，也不注意自己的身体。”童修明风趣地说：“我的身子是铁打的，风吹不动，雨淋不透，为了建设社会主义受点劳苦有什么关系。”
    童修明是安徽和县人，从小帮人看牛，长大后种过十多年田，以后做弹花工，做了十多年。他这样热心支援农业，是受了党的教育，深刻地认识到农业生产的重要性。但是住在隔壁的金大妈见他那样殷勤送肥，却还以为他是在搞“副业”。有一天，金大妈问童修明道：“你天天送粪下乡，一个月拿多少钱？”童修明笑着说：“支援农业，就是为整个社会主义建设出力，怎么能计较钱呢？”
    凤凰小队收了他的粪，给他报酬他不要，社员们也过意不去，今年3月，敲锣打鼓地把一面锦旗和一张喜报送到他工作的店里，这时，童修明的心情久久不能平静，他激动地对小队的社员们说：“我挑起粪桶时，就想到去年参加全市财贸系统先进工作者代表大会时，一位市委负责同志讲的话：‘我们支援农业是为了加速社会主义建设，是份内的事情！’我正是怀着这种心情坚持着每天送肥的，看到你们丰收，我比什么都高兴。”
