    Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, hosted a banquet tonight to bid farewell to Nakajima Kenzo, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, and his wife, as well as his entourage, Gotō Azuma.

    At the banquet, Yang Hansheng said that the signing of the joint statement on cultural exchange between the peoples of China and Japan heralds that the cultural exchange between the peoples of China and Japan will blossom more vividly. At the same time, it powerfully illustrates that the continuous development of friendship between the peoples of China and Japan cannot be blocked or destroyed by any reactionary forces!

    Yang Hansheng said that cultural exchange between the peoples of China and Japan stems from the desire for friendship and unity between the two peoples. The Chinese people have made, are making, and will continue to make unremitting efforts to enhance the friendship and cultural exchange between the peoples of China and Japan.

    Yang Hansheng praised Mr. Nakajima Kenzo for his outstanding contributions to the development of cultural exchange between the peoples of China and Japan and to the enhancement of friendship between us. He said that Mr. Nakajima, together with the Japanese people, has made tremendous efforts to eliminate the reactionary forces that implement a policy of hostility toward China, create "two Chinas," and hinder the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. This is a great support for the Chinese people's struggle against the US imperialist plot to create "two Chinas."

    Yang Hansheng said that the Japanese people's struggle against US imperialism is constantly achieving victories, and this struggle has now entered a new stage. The cultural and friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan have also entered a new stage. The signing of the second "Joint Statement on Cultural Exchange between the Peoples of China and Japan" at this time is of even greater significance. It will open up a bright and splendid future for the cultural relations and friendly unity between the Chinese and Japanese people in the future.

    Nakajima Kenzo also spoke at the banquet. He said that he was particularly happy to be able to sign the joint statement on cultural exchange between the peoples of China and Japan with Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. He said that Japan should develop new friendly relations with China. Our two peoples have a common enemy and are waging a common struggle against this enemy. He expressed that after returning home, he would work diligently and with full confidence for the cause of Japan-China cultural exchange. He warmly congratulated the signing of the "Joint Statement on Cultural Exchange between the Peoples of China and Japan," wished for the development of friendly relations between the peoples of Japan and China, and wished the two peoples' struggle against their common enemy a final victory.

    Among those attending the banquet were Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, as well as well-known figures from all walks of life, including Xia Yan, Mei Lanfang, Zhao Puchu, Tian Han, Lü Ji, Zhao Anbo, Ma Sicong, Zhou Erfu, Zheng Senyu, Chen Yu, Ma Shaobo, Ye Qianyu, Zhao Feng, and Lin Lin.
