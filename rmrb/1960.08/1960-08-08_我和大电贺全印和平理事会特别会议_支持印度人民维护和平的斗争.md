Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The China Peace Committee sent a telegram on the 5th to the special meeting of the All-India Peace Council, congratulating it on its opening.

The telegram said that the Indian people's efforts to ease international tensions, achieve universal disarmament, adhere to a policy of peace and neutrality, oppose foreign military bases and aggressive military treaties, and oppose imperialism and support the people of all countries in their struggle to win and safeguard national independence have contributed to the cause of safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people support the Indian people's struggle to win and safeguard peace, and support the Indian people's just demand to liberate Goa.

The telegram said that the current international situation is unprecedentedly favorable to the struggle for peace. The heroic struggles of the people of Japan, Cuba, and other countries powerfully demonstrate that the peace-loving people of all countries, as long as they unite and resolutely struggle against the imperialist forces of war, can truly safeguard world peace.

The telegram pointed out that the Chinese people have always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, advocated resolving all international disputes through negotiations, and opposed new war threats from imperialism. The Chinese people are willing to work with the Indian people to ease international tensions, to eliminate foreign military bases and aggressive military treaties in Asia, and to conclude a treaty of non-aggression and peace among all countries in Asia and the Pacific Rim, including the United States, to build this entire region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

The China Peace Committee requested the meeting in its telegram to convey the friendship of the Chinese people to the Indian people, and wished the meeting success.
