Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 19th: Kenzo Nakajima, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, and his wife, along with attendant Goofu Shirato, who came to China for a visit at the invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, left Guangzhou today to return home after concluding their visit in China.

The Japanese guests arrived in Guangzhou by plane from Beijing yesterday, accompanied by Lin Lin, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.

Last night, the Guangzhou branch of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries hosted a banquet to bid farewell to Kenzo Nakajima and his wife, as well as Goofu Shirato. In his speech at the banquet, Kenzo Nakajima expressed his gratitude for the Chinese people's sincere reception and their support for the Japanese people's anti-American struggle. He said that the statement issued in Peking by the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association and the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign countries on strengthening cultural exchanges between the peoples of the two countries will play an important role in promoting cultural exchanges between the two countries. He said that at present, the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality still has to go through an arduous and tortuous process, but the final victory will surely belong to the righteous Japanese people.
