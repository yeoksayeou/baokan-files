    Unified Leadership, Rational Use, Separate Accounting, Equivalent Exchange
    Zhengzhou Zhongyuan Commune Factories' Large-Scale Collaboration
    (Our Dispatch) Zhengzhou, Henan Province: The textile branch of the Zhengzhou Zhongyuan People's Commune, proceeding from the principle of "benefiting production and facilitating the masses," has organized the No. 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 State-owned Cotton Textile Factories to carry out comprehensive large-scale collaboration. Over the past three months, new scenes have emerged in production, livelihood, and the ideological awareness of the workers.
    These five state-owned cotton textile factories are located adjacent to each other, with similar conditions in all aspects, and mutual collaboration has many favorable factors. However, for a long time, the factories, apart from general contact, lacked close collaborative relationships. This situation is very incompatible with the current excellent situation of the comprehensive and continuous leap forward.
    In view of this situation, the textile branch, under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee, has listed organizing this large-scale collaboration of these factories as an important task at present, adhering to the principle of "unified leadership, rational use, separate accounting, and equivalent exchange." It has also transferred 25 cadres from various factories, including the heads of living quarters, supply and marketing section chiefs, general affairs section chiefs, and directors of mobile workshops, to establish an organizational leading body and gradually organize the realization of this large-scale collaboration among these factories. Currently, there are 20 collaborative projects. The collaboration forms can be roughly divided into three types: First, for projects of the same nature that are suitable for centralized production (or operation, use) and have the conditions for centralization, such as water and electricity, sand casting, and procurement, personnel and equipment are concentrated to implement unified leadership and unified operation and management (the ownership of materials and equipment remains unchanged). Second, for projects that are not suitable for centralization or temporarily do not have the conditions for centralization, such as production of different natures and the vast majority of living welfare facilities, unified leadership is implemented, and they are decentralized to various units to serve production. Third, for temporary collaboration, regular collaboration meetings are held, and on the principle of equivalent exchange, each provides what the other needs and makes up for deficiencies.
    Since these factories have implemented collaboration, the following advantages have been shown: First, it is convenient to fully tap the potential in all aspects, so that everyone can make the best of their talents and everything can be used to the fullest extent, so as to better ensure the completion of various production tasks. In the past, these five factories each had a set of sand casting equipment. Due to small-scale decentralized production, there were few people and low technology, and large castings could not be made. After centralization, the furnace was opened every day instead of an average of once every four days. Not only was the supply of small castings to various factories guaranteed in a timely manner, but also large castings could be manufactured, and only the equipment of two factories was used to meet the sand casting tasks of the five factories. Second, in terms of raw material supply, after implementing the method of "unified procurement, separate accounting, and mutual exchange," the scope of procurement has been expanded, the sources have increased, and many missing materials have been resolved. Originally, each factory had procurement personnel stationed in large cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin. Now, it is enough to send one person to one place. In addition, each factory openly visited each other's warehouses, adjusted surpluses and deficiencies, and solved many materials that were not easy to purchase on the market. According to statistics, in the past few months, the factories have adjusted a total of 48 kinds of materials, 6,518 pieces, which has guaranteed production needs in a timely manner. Third, after centralized management, the living welfare of the workers in each factory has also been improved. Fourth, in large-scale collaboration, the workers give convenience to others and leave difficulties to themselves, which has greatly improved their communist ideological awareness.

    统一领导合理使用分别核算等价交换
    郑州中原公社各厂大协作
    本报讯　河南省郑州市中原人民公社纺织分社从“有利生产，方便群众”的原则出发，组织国棉一、三、四、五、六厂开展全面大协作。三个月来，在生产、生活和职工思想觉悟等方面，都出现了一番新生景象。
    这五个国营棉纺织厂厂址毗邻，各方面情况类似，相互协作具有很多有利因素。但是，长期以来各厂除一般接触外，缺乏亲密的协作关系。这种状况和当前全面持续跃进的大好形势很不适应。
    根据这种情况，纺织分社在上级党委领导下，把组织这几个厂的大协作列为自己当前的一项重要任务，本着“统一领导，合理使用，分别核算，等价交换”的原则，并从各厂抽调生活厂长、供销科长、总务科长、机动车间主任等干部二十五人，建立了组织领导机构，逐步组织实现这几个厂的大协作。目前协作项目已有二十项的协作。协作形式大体可分三种：一、对性质相同，适合集中生产（或经营、使用）而又有条件集中的，如水电、翻砂、采购等，把人员设备集中起来，实行统一领导，统一经营管理（物资设备的所有权不变）。二、对不宜集中或暂时没有条件集中的，如不同性质的生产和绝大多数的生活福利设施，实行统一领导，分散各单位为生产服务。三、临时性的协作，定期召开协作会议，本着等价交换原则，互通有无，余缺调剂。
    这几个厂实行协作以来，已经显示出以下的优越性：一、便于充分挖掘各方面的潜力，作到人尽其才，物尽其用，更好地保证各项生产任务的完成。过去这五个厂各有一套翻砂设备，由于小规模的分散生产，人少技术低，大型铸件干不了。集中起来以后，由原来平均每四天开一次炉到每天开一次炉，不但及时保证了各厂小型铸件供应，大型铸件也能制造了，而且只用两个厂的设备便满足了五个厂翻砂任务的要求。二、在原材料供应上，实行了“统一采购，分别核算，互通有无”的办法后，采购范围扩大、来源增多，许多缺少的材料都得到解决。原来各厂在上海、天津等大城市都派有采购员，现在一个地方派一个人便够了。此外各厂还公开仓库互相参观，余缺调剂，解决了很多市场上不易购买的材料。据统计，几个月来各厂共调剂物资四十八种、六千五百一十八件，及时保证了生产需要。三、集中管理以后，各厂职工生活福利也得到了改善。四、在大协作中，职工把方便让给别人，困难留给自己，大大提高了共产主义思想觉悟。
