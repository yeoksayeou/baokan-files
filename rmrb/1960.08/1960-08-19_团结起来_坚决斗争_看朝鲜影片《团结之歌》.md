    Unite and Fight Resolutely
    ——Watching the Korean Film "Song of Unity"
    Xie Fengsong
    The film "Song of Unity," which we saw during the "Korean Film Week," can be called an epic that enthusiastically praises the revolutionary struggle of the working class. With distinct class love and hatred, the artists reproduced the face of Korean society in the 1930s under the iron heel of Japanese fascism, and with full revolutionary enthusiasm, they praised the struggle launched by the working class in the enemy's rear against Japanese imperialist aggression at that time.
    The story of the film takes place in a chemical fertilizer factory in a certain city in Korea. The filmmakers demonstrated their high artistic generalization ability. Through the events that occurred in this fertilizer factory and the activities of the workers, like a mirror, they reflected the life and struggle of the entire Korean society at that time. At that time, in order to expand its war of aggression, Japanese imperialism intensified its plunder of the occupied Korea and Northeast China. The workers, whose working conditions were already extremely harsh and struggling on the brink of death, were also faced with new threats of layoffs and unemployment, as well as increased working hours and a greater lack of life security.
      In addition to being deeply oppressed and exploited by the Japanese invaders, the workers were also subjected to the insatiable extraction and plunder by the domestic reactionary bourgeoisie and usurers. The workers worked desperately for a month, and the meager wages they received from the capitalists after various deductions were almost completely plundered by the usurers before they even reached their homes. Workers like Wenji, a middle-aged worker, had a family with no clothes to cover their bodies, no rice to fill their stomachs, and were terminally ill, unable to afford medical treatment or medicine. The oppression and exploitation were endless, making it impossible to survive. What to do? Unite and fight! – This is the only way out. On the other hand, the film depicts the heroic struggle of the Korean people and the Korean working class under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party. On the front line was the battle of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army led by Comrade Kim Il-sung in Northeast China, the victory of the Luozigou battle. In the enemy's heart, there was the strike struggle of the working class led by the underground organization of the Labor Party, which gained the support of the broad masses of peasants. These two aspects of the struggle cooperated with each other, supported each other, and encouraged each other, forming the entire anti-imperialist front of the Korean people. This front was also closely linked with the entire international anti-imperialist struggle at that time, as the worker Rong-soo said: "There are also workers in the Soviet Union and China who are supporting our struggle." The film made a concentrated and prominent representation of this struggle.
    Revolutionary literature and art should better inspire, educate, and encourage the people, and promote the development of revolutionary struggles through the truthful reflection of life and the exposure of the essence of life. The creators of "Song of Unity" followed the principles of Marxist-Leninist artistic creation, demonstrated a clear political tendency in their works, and expressed a clear purpose of uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy. They shaped many vivid artistic images, allowing people to gain enlightenment and education on how to treat life and struggle from these artistic images.
    Zhezhi, Rong-soo, and Jin-sook are all very lovable characters. Especially the young worker Rong-soo, his deep-seated hatred for the enemy, his firm belief in the revolutionary struggle, his vigorous vitality, and his optimistic and upward spirit can give people great encouragement. When he stood on the top of the water tower and righteously exposed the criminal acts of Japanese imperialism and Korean traitors, it made people feel that it was a bright red revolutionary flag flying high in the sky, attracting countless revolutionaries to advance bravely. The images of Wenji and Shunbi are also very moving. They originally only worked hard to make a living, thinking that "as long as you are diligent and quick, you can always live a good life." They did not want to participate in political struggles and attempted to live peacefully. However, the tragic life, the blood of the people, and the education of the Party finally led Wenji to the path of the revolutionary struggle of the working class. The oppressed people will be inspired by the path Wenji has taken, awaken, and join the struggle. This kind of artistic enlightenment and education is needed by the interests of the proletarian revolution itself. The lyrics in "Song of Unity" say it well: "Which soldier holding a red flag flatters the rich? Only those who are despicable and shameless are fascinated by the golden position. Let the despicable people go if they wish, we will resolutely defend the red flag!" Yes, our proletarian fighters and revolutionary artists will forever hold high the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism, bravely advance, and fight to the end!

### 团结起来　坚决斗争——看朝鲜影片《团结之歌》

    团结起来　坚决斗争
    ——看朝鲜影片《团结之歌》
    谢逢松
    我们在“朝鲜电影周”中看到的《团结之歌》这部影片，可以称得起是一首热情赞颂工人阶级革命斗争的史诗。艺术家们用鲜明的阶级的爱憎，重现了二十世纪三十年代在日本法西斯铁蹄之下的朝鲜社会的面貌，用饱满的革命热情，歌颂了当时工人阶级在敌后发动的反对日本帝国主义侵略的斗争。
    影片的故事，发生在朝鲜某城市一个化学肥料工厂里。电影创作
  者们显示了自己高度的艺术概括的才能，通过这个化肥厂发生的事情和工人的活动，像一面镜子，反映
  了当时整个朝鲜社会的生活面貌和人民的斗争情况。当时，日本帝国主义为了扩大侵略战争，加紧掠夺被占领的朝鲜和中国东北的财富。本来劳动条件极端恶劣，挣扎在死亡线上的工人，又遭到了新的裁减人员的失业威胁和增加工时、生命更无保障的危险。
      工人们除了深受日寇残酷压迫和剥削之外，还要受到本国的反动资产阶级和高利贷者贪得无餍的榨取和掠夺。工人们拼死拼活劳动了一个月，从资本家手里拿回来经过七除八扣的一点工资，还没走进家门，就被那高利贷者剥削得所剩无几了。像文吉这样的中年工人，一家老小无衣蔽体，无米充饥，自身病入膏肓，无力延医，无钱买药。被压榨，被剥夺，无休无止，活不下去了，那怎么办？团结起来斗争！——这是唯一的出路。影片在另一方面，便写了朝鲜人民、朝鲜工人阶级在朝鲜劳动党领导下的英勇斗争。在最前线，是金日成同志领导的朝鲜人民革命军在中国东北的战斗，罗子沟战役的胜利。在敌人的心腹，是劳动党地下组织领导的工人阶级的罢工斗争，这斗争取得广大农民的支持。这两方面的斗争互相配合，互相声援，互相鼓舞，就形成了整个朝鲜人民的反帝战线。这条战线，还与当时整个国际反帝斗争紧密结合，正如工人容洙说的：“还有苏联和中国的工人们也在支援我们的斗争。”影片对这一斗争情况作了集中和突出的表现。
    革命的文艺，是要通过对生活的真实反映，通过对生活本质的揭露，更好地去启发人民，教育人民，鼓舞人民，推动革命斗争的发展。《团结之歌》的创作者们，遵循着马克思列宁主义的艺术创作原则，在作品里表现了鲜明的政治倾向性，表现了明确的团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的目的性。他们塑造了众多的生动的艺术形象，使人们在这些艺术形象身上得到对待生活和斗争的启示和教育。
    哲植、容洙、今淑这些人物，都是很可爱的。特别是青年工人容洙，他那种对敌人的刻骨的仇恨，对革命斗争的坚定信念，旺盛的生命力，乐观向上的精神，都能给人巨大的鼓舞。当他站在水塔高处，义正词严地揭露日本帝国主义和朝奸走狗的罪恶行为的时候，使人觉得就是一面鲜红的革命旗帜在高空飘扬，招引着无数的革命者奋勇前进。文吉和顺必的形象，也是十分动人的。他们原先只是为了自己的生活而去出力卖命，以为“只要手勤脚快，总能过上好日子”。他们不想参加政治斗争，企图安分守己地生活。可是，惨痛的生活、人民的鲜血、党的教育，终于使文吉走上工人阶级革命斗争的道路。被压迫的人们，将从文吉走过的道路得到启发，走向觉醒，投入斗争。这种艺术的启示和教育，是无产阶级革命利益本身所需要的。《团结之歌》里的歌词说得好：“高举红旗的战士，谁向富人阿谀求情？只有那些卑鄙无耻的人，才被黄金地位迷住了心。卑鄙的人愿走就走吧，我们坚决捍卫红旗！”是的，我们无产阶级战士、革命的文艺家，将永远高举马克思列宁主义的革命旗帜，奋勇前进，斗争到底！
