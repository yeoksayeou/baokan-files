    The great historical mission of accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture and enabling agriculture to soar on wings to stand shoulder to shoulder with industry has been placed before the working class. "Two melons on one vine, workers and peasants are one family. Accelerating agricultural modernization is our important responsibility." Shanghai workers, like workers across the country, not only have a close, flesh-and-blood relationship with the countryside in terms of life and production, and therefore cherish infinitely deep affection for their peasant brothers, but more importantly, they recognize the important responsibility borne by the revolutionary leading class, and therefore regard supporting agriculture as their bounden duty.
    In the days and nights of supporting agriculture, in those seemingly ordinary work positions, do you know how many vivid stories there are that cannot be written or told enough! If you hear these stories, you will understand: once the broad masses of workers are armed with the idea that "the national economy takes agriculture as its foundation," how they work tirelessly, without regard to remuneration, trying every means, and welcoming difficulties with a smile in order to support agriculture! How magnificent and broad their minds are, and how noble their style is!
    Making Sure Every Part is Qualified
    "A flower in the field depends entirely on fertilizer to thrive." While peasant brothers are accumulating and making large quantities of fertilizer on the motherland, Shanghai workers are also rushing to produce fertilizer production equipment. Workers at the Liangong Machine Factory, which has always produced oil accessories, have made outstanding contributions in the production of fertilizer equipment.
    This year, the factory received the task of manufacturing twelve sets of mainframes for equipment that produces eight hundred tons of chemical fertilizer per year—combined presses—and twenty-two sets of alkaline pumps for equipment that produces two thousand tons of chemical fertilizer per year. The quality requirements for these pieces of equipment are very high. The tolerance of some parts is less than one-seventh the thickness of a human hair. In principle, these parts can only be processed using highly precise grinding machines and milling machines; however, the machine tools in the Liangong Machine Factory are all some "old-fashioned" machines that have been used for decades and are "missing legs and teeth". The workers of Liangong Factory did not bow to the difficulties. They said: "Even if there are thousands of difficulties and dangers blocking the way, we will ensure that every part is qualified!" When the factory's Party organization launched a large-scale ideological mobilization of all workers, everyone became more clear that supporting agriculture was a top strategic task, and morale was even higher. A technical revolution craze to create native equipment immediately swept the factory. In just half a month, more than twenty native grinding machines, native planers, and native milling machines were manufactured. Don't underestimate these "rustic" pieces of native equipment; the quality of the products they process surpasses the level of foreign equipment. Even complex parts that cannot be ground by precision grinding machines can be made by native equipment.
    Among the thousands of workers who are working selflessly to support agriculture, one name is particularly loud: Communist Party member Ye Linggen. This old worker, who has been elected as an advanced producer in the city for three consecutive years and has recently been promoted to technician, spent his childhood under the whip of landlords. He deeply understands the concerns of his peasant brothers and understands that fertilizer is the food of crops. Now that he hears that he is manufacturing fertilizer production equipment for his peasant brothers, he can't wait to use all his strength and pour his heart and soul into every part. When the leadership decided to ask him to be responsible for compiling the process route, he was stunned at first: My education is low, can I really do it? However, in order to support agriculture, even the greatest difficulties must be overcome! He bravely accepted the task, racking his brains day and night, learning from veteran masters and operating with young workers. Finally, in the processing of thousands of precision parts, there was not a single rework, repair, or quality accident due to the unreasonable process route he compiled. When these equipments were assembled, Ye Linggen couldn't help but smile from the bottom of his heart when he saw the shiny parts.
    The workers of Liangong Machine Factory proudly told reporters: You ask about achievements? We have completed the production task for fertilizer equipment for the whole year ahead of schedule in the first half of the year! A few days ago, these equipments, carrying the deep feelings of thousands of workers, have been transported to the coastal frontline of the motherland, Fujian, and to the remote border areas of Yunnan, Xinjiang, as well as Qinghai and the suburbs of Shanghai.
    In the green fields of Jiading County in the suburbs of Shanghai, there is a row of new buildings with red walls and black tiles. This is the newly built fertilizer plant. When the fertilizer plant was test-run, the surrounding peasants were as happy as if they were celebrating a festival. Sixty-seven-year-old peasant Yang A’gen smiled from ear to ear. He said: "Chairman Mao has opened a fertilizer plant at our doorstep!"
    The Crystallization of Worker-Peasant Experience
    In the fields of Baihe People's Commune, Qingpu County, it was particularly lively a few days ago: while harvesting the already ripe double-season early rice, they were also deep-plowing the land to rush-plant the double-season late rice. The small wooden plow reformed by technical workers and peasants who went to the countryside to provide support showed its power in this deep plowing.
    Not long after more than ten workers from Shanghai Heavy Machinery Plant went to the countryside, the commune Party committee gave them a task: to reform the deep-plowing plow so that it can meet the requirements of deep plowing and be easy to use. Since 1958, the commune has been reforming the deep-plowing plow, but it has not been successful. Either the plowing is not deep enough, or the plowing is too deep and it cannot be pulled. The workers of the Heavy Machinery Plant accepted this task and made a plow in a few days, but once it was tested, it was not only bulky and inconvenient, but also the plow lifted onto the ground after plowing only a few steps. It failed.
    Before the second trial production, the leader of the support working group, old worker Zhou Pengying, one day was with several commune members, discussing the characteristics and usage of the plow. Those commune members talked eloquently about the characteristics and usage of the plow, but they didn't understand the technical principles and couldn't say how to reform the wooden plow. But after such a discussion, Zhou Pengying's mind suddenly opened up. He thought: "Peasants have rich experience in plowing fields, but they don't understand technology very well; we have technology, but we don't understand the characteristics and technical requirements of agricultural implements. Combining the two, won't the problem be solved?" So he humbly learned from the old peasants, paying attention to the opinions of the peasants, and rolled up his trouser legs to learn plowing with the peasants. With a fervent heart to support agriculture wholeheartedly, and with the practical experience of learning to plow fields, the technology of the workers going to the countryside can be put to great use here. He remembered: when operating on a lathe, as long as the angle of the cutting tool is smaller and the head is sharper, the work will be faster and lighter. Can the principle of the cutting tool also be applied to the plowshare? After discussing with group workers Li Minhao, Gu Haolong, etc., everyone agreed. They worked with the commune members of the farm implement factory to try to make a new plow. With anxious hearts, they asked the old peasants to try plowing again. The effect was very good, and because the knife is movable and can go up and down, it can adapt to the requirements of plowing at different depths. Baihe production team leader specially summarized three advantages for this small wooden plow: first, it is easy to use; second, the plowing depth fully meets the requirements; third, it saves materials and is simple to manufacture, and can be widely promoted.
    "The deep-plowing plow has been successfully developed!" The news immediately spread throughout the commune like it had wings. Peasants sent their old plows to the agricultural implement factory for modification, and some production teams even sent carpenters to support the agricultural implement factory. In a few days, more than one hundred and ninety units were promoted. In this rush harvesting and planting, when people saw the light and nimble way this new plow turned over the black oily soil, they couldn't help but boast: this small wooden plow is not simple, it is the crystallization of worker-peasant experience!
    Ninety Li Journey on a Stormy Night
    This year, five days before Labor Day on May 1st, at 11 pm, the sky was covered with dark clouds, lightning flashed, and thunder struck head-on, and a rainstorm was about to come. At this time, on the highway from Huayang Bridge in Songjiang to Shanghai, a tricycle was moving rapidly, and three figures were swaying beside the car.
    Who are these three people? They are workers from the Shanghai Navigation Mark Factory and the Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory who are supporting the Chengdong Commune in Songjiang, one is named Chen Delong, one is named Chen Guiyuan, and one is named Zhang Longgen. This night, they received an emergency task: the county party committee required all communes to rush to repair all livestock tools in the breeding farms within three days to meet the needs of the great development of the pig-raising industry. The twenty-eight comrades who went to the countryside to support together guaranteed to complete the task on the spot. That night, they started to repair the eighteen feed cutters that the breeding farms were waiting to use urgently. However, all the blades of these eighteen feed cutters had to be electric welded before they could be used, but the commune's agricultural implement factory did not have an electric welding machine. Just when everyone was very anxious, Chen Delong and other three people stepped forward and were willing to take on this heavy burden, traveling ninety li in the dark to send the blades to the factory in the city for processing that night. Now these three people are taking turns stepping on the car, advancing on the highway at the fastest speed.
    Before they had traveled ten li, the wind was getting stronger and the rain was getting heavier. The storm had come head-on. The road seemed to be getting longer and longer; the night was so dark that they couldn't see their fingers. Rainwater flowed straight down from their bodies, and all their clothes were soaked. At this time, every step forward required all their strength. They really wanted to take shelter from the rain, but they couldn't! The breeding farm was waiting urgently, the comrades were waiting to assemble, and there were only three days. In any case, they had to complete this ninety li journey! Thinking of this, their spirits were even more uplifted, and they pedaled even harder. When the car could not be pedaled, they would have one person pedal, one person push, and one person shine a flashlight to light the way. They fought the wind and rain like this for more than ten hours with tenacious perseverance and indomitable spirit. By the time they arrived in the city, it was noon the next day.
    While the workers in the city factory were rushing to electric weld the blades, the workers who went to the countryside to support also launched a battle of rush repairs with the commune members of the agricultural implement factory. Three days later, batches of green fodder cutters were successively transported from the commune agricultural implement factory to various breeding farms. In order to commend the spirit of the Shanghai workers who wholeheartedly supported agriculture, the commune members of the agricultural implement factory wrote the following poem on the blackboard newspaper:
    Worker brothers have a noble style, no difficulty can scare them;
    You have made great contributions to the realization of agricultural mechanization in the countryside!
    What did the workers think? Let's copy a poem they answered to their peasant brothers:
    For the sake of the peasants using machines, it doesn't matter if we are a little tired.
    Workers and peasants are of one mind, communism will come soon!
    This is the wish of our working class. These two ordinary poems are the best portrayal of the new worker-peasant relationship.

### 支援农业的日日夜夜

    支援农业的日日夜夜
    新华社驻上海记者和通讯员集体采写
    加速农业的技术改造，让农业插上翅膀同工业比翼高飞的伟大历史任务，提到了工人阶级的面前。“一根藤上两个瓜，工人农民是一家，加快农业现代化，我们责任是重大。”上海工人同全国工人一样，不只是因为在生活上、生产上同农村有着血肉相连的关系，因而对农民兄弟怀着无限深厚的亲密情谊；更重要的是认识到革命领导阶级所担负的重大责任，因而把支援农业看作是自己的天职。
    就在支援农业的日日夜夜里，在那些看来十分平凡的工作岗位上，你知道有着多少写不完、说不尽的生动故事啊！你如果听到这些故事，你就会了解：广大工人群众一经用“国民经济以农业为基础”的思想武装起来，为了支援农业，是怎样的不辞艰苦，不计报酬，千方百计，笑迎困难！他们的胸怀是多么壮丽和宽广，他们的风格是多么的高！
    定叫每只零件都合格
    “庄稼一枝花，全靠肥当家。”当农民兄弟在祖国大地上大量积肥造肥的同时，上海工人也在突击赶制化肥生产设备。一向生产石油配件的良工机器厂的工人，就在生产化肥设备中作出了出色的贡献。
    今年，这个厂接到十二套年产八百吨化肥设备的主机——联合压机和二十二套年产二千吨化肥设备的碱液泵制造任务。这些设备的质量要求很高，有些零部件的公差，还不到一根头发丝的七分之一那样细。照道理，这种零部件只有使用高度精密的磨床和铣床才能加工；可是，良工机器厂里的机床，偏偏都是一些“断腿缺牙”的已经使用了几十年的“老爷货”。良工厂的工人没有向困难低头。他们说：“哪怕千难万险挡道，定叫每只零件合格！”当这个厂的党组织发动全厂工人大务虚，大家更加明确了支援农业是头等重要的战略任务，斗志更加昂扬，一个大造土设备的技术革命热潮立刻席卷全厂，短短半个月，二十多台土磨床、土刨床和土铣床就制造出来了。别看这些土设备“土里土气”，可就是它加工的产品质量胜过洋设备的水平；连精密磨床无法研磨的复杂零件，土设备也大显威风，把它造出来了。
    在那些为了支援农业而进行忘我劳动的千百个工人当中，有一个名字分外响亮，他就是共产党员叶林根。这个曾经连续三年当选市先进生产者、新近被提拔为技术员的老工人，少年时代是在地主的皮鞭下度过的，他深切地懂得农民兄弟的心事，懂得肥料是农作物的粮食。现在听说是为农民兄弟制造化肥生产设备，他恨不得把全身的劲儿都使出来，把自己的心血灌注到每个零件中去。当领导上决定要他负责编制工艺路线的时候，他起先还楞了一下：我的文化低，到底行不行呀？可是，为了支援农业，天大的困难也得战胜它！他勇敢地接受了任务，日夜苦思苦想，既向老师傅请教，又跟青工一道操作，终于在成千个精密零件的加工过程中，没有因为他编制的工艺路线不合理而发生一次返工退修和质量事故。当这些设备装配的时候，叶林根看到那些闪闪发光的零件，禁不住从心里笑出声音来了。
    良工机器厂的工人自豪地告诉记者：你问成绩么？今年全年化肥设备的生产任务，我们已经提前在上半年全部完成了！前些日子，这些设备带着千万工人的深厚情谊，已经运往祖国的海防前线福建和遥远的边疆云南、新疆，以及青海和上海的郊区去了。
    在上海郊区嘉定县的青葱田野上，有一排红墙黑瓦的新型建筑物，这就是新建成的化肥厂。当这个化肥厂试车的时候，周围的农民都像办喜事一样高兴。六十七岁的老农民杨阿根笑得合不拢嘴。他说：“毛主席把肥料厂开到我们家门口来了！”
    工农经验的结晶
    青浦县白鹤人民公社的田野上，前几天分外热闹：一边收割已经黄熟了的双季早稻，一边就在为抢种双季晚稻而深翻土地。下乡支援的技术工人和农民一起改革的小木犁，在这次深耕中显示了它的威风。
    上海重型机床厂的十多位工人下乡不久，公社党委就交给他们一项任务：改革深耕犁，使它既能达到深耕要求，又要使用方便。原来这个公社从1958年以来，就一直在搞深耕犁的改革，可是一直没有搞成功，不是耕不深，就是耕得深了又拖不动。重型机床厂的工人接受了这个任务，在几天之内就搞成了一只犁，可是一经试耕，不但笨重不便，而且没耕上几步，犁就抬上了地面。失败了。
    第二次试制之前，支援工作组的组长、老工人周鹏英，有一天和几个社员在一起，谈论起犁的特性和使用方法。那几个社员对犁的特性和使用方法说得头头是道，可就是不懂得技术原理，说不出应该怎么改革木犁的意见。但这么一议论，周鹏英的思想却豁然开朗了。他想：“农民有丰富的犁田经验，可是不大懂技术；我们有技术，可就是不懂农具的特性和技术要求。两下一结合，不就解决问题了吗？”于是他一边虚心地拜老农民为师，注意听取农民的意见，一边卷起裤脚管，跟农民一起去学习耕田。有了一颗全心全意支援农业的热心，又有了学习犁田的实践经验，下乡工人的技术在这里就大有用武之地了。他想起：在车床上操作，只要车刀角度小一些，头尖些，车起活来就既快又轻，犁头能不能也运用车刀的原理呢？跟小组工人李敏浩、顾浩龙等一商量，大家都赞成。他们就同农具厂的社员一起，试制了一只新犁，怀着焦急的心情，再请老农民一起试耕，效果果然很好，而且因为刀是活动的，可上可下，能够适应耕翻不同深度的要求。白鹤生产队长特地为这只小木犁总结了三条好处：一是使用轻便；二是耕翻深度完全符合要求；三是材料省，制造简单，可以大量推广。
    “深耕犁搞成功了！”消息顿时像长了翅膀，传遍了整个公社。农民都把旧犁送来农具厂改制，有的生产队还抽出木工支援农具厂。不几天，一下子就推广了一百九十几部。在这次抢收抢种中，当人们看到这种新犁翻耕黑油油的泥土时那种轻快劲儿，都不禁夸耀地说：这个小木犁可不简单，它是工农经验的结晶哩！
    风雨夜的九十里路程
    今年“五一”劳动节的前五天，深夜十一点，天空乌云密布，电光一闪，雷声迎面劈来，眼看一场暴风雨就要来临了。这时，从松江华阳桥到上海市的公路上，有一辆三轮拖车在急速地行进，车子旁边幌动着三个人影。
    这三个人是谁？是上海航标厂和信谊药厂支援松江城东公社的工人，一个叫陈德龙，一个叫陈桂源，一个叫张龙根。这天晚上，他们接受了一项紧急任务：县委要求各公社在三天之内突击修好所有饲养场的畜牧工具，以适应养猪事业大发展的需要。他们一道下乡支援的二十八位同志，当场保证完成任务。这天晚上，他们就将饲养场等着急用的十八台饲料切割机动手修理起来。可是，这十八台饲料切割机的全部刀片，必须烧过电焊以后才能使用，而公社农具厂是没有电焊机的。正当大家十分焦急的时候，陈德龙等三个人挺身而出，愿意挑起这副重担，摸黑赶它九十里路程，当晚把刀片送到市区厂里去加工。现在就是这三个人轮流地踏着车，以最快的速度在公路上前进着。
    还没有踏上十里路，风越吹越紧，雨越下越大，暴风雨已经迎头上来了。路，越走好像越长；夜，黑得伸手不见五指。雨水从他们身上直淌下来，全身的衣服都湿透了。这时每前进一步，都要使出全身的力气。他们真想去躲一躲雨，但是不行！饲养场在等着急用，同志们在等着装配，时间只有三天，无论如何也要赶完这九十里路！他们想到这里，精神更加振奋，脚下踏得也更带劲了。车子踏不动了，他们就一个人踏，一个人推，一个人还要打着手电筒照路。他们就这样以顽强的毅力和不屈不挠的精神和风雨搏斗了十多个小时。等赶到市区，已经是第二天的中午了。
    当市区工厂里的工人突击电焊刀片的同时，下乡支援的工人也同农具厂社员一起，展开了一场抢修的战斗。三天以后，一台台的青饲料切割机，就从公社农具厂陆续运到了各个饲养场。为了表扬上海工人的这种全心全意支援农业的精神，农具厂的社员在黑板报上写了这样一首诗：
    工人大哥风格高，任何困难吓不倒；
    农村实现机械化，你们立下大功劳！
    工人们怎么想的呢？还是抄一首他们回答农民兄弟的诗歌吧：
    为了农民用机器，辛苦一点没关系。
    工农团结心一条，共产主义早日到！
    这就是我们工人阶级的心愿。平常的两首诗，正是新的工农关系的最好写照。
