Editor's Note: From January to July this year, the national steel output has greatly increased compared to the same period last year. In order to advance victoriously and strive for an even greater increase in steel production in the next five months, it is necessary to concentrate the wisdom and strength of the vast number of workers, specifically and practically solve the problems existing in production, further carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and vigorously consolidate, promote, and improve advanced experiences. Therefore, we have created this special column. We hope that comrades on the steel front, as well as comrades in coal, transportation, machinery, and other departments closely related to steel production, will make use of this platform to introduce your experiences and methods for solving problems in production, and to put forward your opinions and suggestions. Let us use collective strength and wisdom to promote a great steel harvest.
    
    How to Push Mine Production to New Heights

    On July 23, our newspaper's correspondent stationed in Anshan held a symposium at the Dagushan Iron Mine of Anshan Iron and Steel. Eleven people participated in the symposium, including workshop directors, section chiefs, foremen, technicians, electric shovel drivers, drilling machine drivers, electric locomotive drivers, and shunters.

    Everyone unanimously agreed in their speeches that, judging from the situation at the Dagushan Iron Mine, to achieve a great leap forward in ore production at present, the following three main links must be grasped in production: First, strengthen equipment maintenance and repair, reduce accidents, and increase equipment operating rates. This requires organizing production workers to learn to be "all-rounders," striving to be able to use and repair equipment; at the same time, it is necessary to educate maintenance workers to improve their sense of responsibility for serving production. Second, strengthen production planning and management, so that planning work closely follows the pace of production leap forward. The plan must be closely integrated with specific measures; in the process of constantly breaking old balances, new balances must be organized in a timely manner. Third, further consolidate and promote the achievements of technical innovation.

    Selected excerpts from the speeches at the symposium are published below.

专栏：

    编者按：今年1至7月，全国的钢产量比去年同期有很大的增长。为了乘胜前进，力争今后五个月钢产量更大幅度地上升，需要集中广大职工的智慧和力量，具体地切实地解决生产中存在的问题，进一步开展技术革新和技术革命运动，大力巩固、推广和提高先进经验。因此，我们特辟了这个专栏。希望钢铁战线上的同志们，以及和夺钢保钢有密切关系的煤炭、运输、机械等部门的同志们，都来利用这块园地，把你们解决生产中的问题的经验办法介绍出来，把你们的意见和建议提出来。让我们用集体的力量和智慧来促成钢铁的大丰收。
    怎样把矿山生产推向新高峰
    7月23日，本报驻鞍山记者在鞍钢大孤山铁矿召开了一次座谈会。参加座谈的有车间主任、段长、工长、技术员、电铲司机、穿孔机司机、电机车司机和调车员等十一人。
    大家在发言中一致认为，从大孤山铁矿情况来看，目前要使矿石生产大跃进，在生产上必须抓住以下三个主要环节：第一、加强设备维护检修，减少事故，提高设备作业率。这就要组织生产工人学作“多面手”，争取能用也能修；同时，要教育检修工人提高为生产服务的责任心。第二、加强生产计划管理工作，使计划工作紧紧跟上生产跃进的脚步。计划要和具体措施紧密结合；在不断打破旧平衡的情况下，及时组织新的平衡。第三、进一步巩固和推广技术革新成果。
    现将座谈会上的发言，选发三篇在下面。
