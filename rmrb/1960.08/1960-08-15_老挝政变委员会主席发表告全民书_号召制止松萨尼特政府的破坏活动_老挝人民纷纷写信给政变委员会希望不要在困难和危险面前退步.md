Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 14th - Vientiane Radio broadcast this morning a proclamation to the entire nation issued on August 14th by Captain Kong Le, Chairman of the Lao Coup Committee, calling on all compatriots who love their country, religion, the royal family, the constitution, and independence to pay attention to the development of the situation; and requiring everyone to unite as soon as possible to fight for the complete elimination of elements within the government who are destroying the motherland.

The proclamation stated that according to reliable sources, a small group of people in the (Phoui Sananikone) government and certain officers in the army are deliberately trying to prolong the current situation and deceive the Lao people into killing each other. Their sole intention is to betray the interests of the people and violate the deep and good wishes of the people's representatives who are willing to sacrifice themselves for the lofty rights of the people, which is: lasting and solid peace in the motherland, avoiding Lao people killing each other, and allowing Laos to enjoy peace and happiness as desired.

The proclamation said: "Brothers in the army, police, public security, and local forces: we and our parents, brothers and sisters, and wives and children have suffered the pain brought about by ten years of war, all of which was brought about by those warmongers who do not want peace. They use unjust and inhumane activities to benefit themselves. I earnestly call on my compatriots not to cooperate with those who endanger the motherland, the peace, happiness, and neutrality of their compatriots. Dear compatriots, you have the strength to fight. It is time for you to stand up and fight to prevent warmongers and unjust and unprincipled elements from entering the government!" The proclamation called on the army, police, local forces, and monks, businessmen, and farmers across the country to rise up and eliminate these people. The proclamation pointed out that "whether peace, happiness, and true independence can be achieved, and whether Lao people killing each other can be stopped, depends entirely on the concerted efforts of the Lao people and cooperation in terms of manpower, spirit, and strength."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 14th - According to a Vientiane Radio broadcast at 9:00 p.m. on the 13th, Captain Kong Le, Chairman of the Lao Coup Committee, issued a call to young students, calling on them to work together to sweep away the unfairness and injustice of the Phoui Sananikone government from Laos in order to guarantee the country's security, independence, and true democracy.

The call said that you are the people who will control the fate of the country in the future. You are the young generation of Laos. Like the Coup Committee, you also hope for peace, justice, freedom, and the progress of the country. Therefore, I call on university students and students to stand up and stop the (Phoui Sananikone) government, for its own selfish interests, from trying to undermine and obstruct the peace, progress, and true neutrality of the Lao people.

In his call, Kong Le thanked the Lao youth, university students, students, and people from all walks of life for their support for him and the Coup Committee, and hoped that the Lao youth, university students, and students would cooperate with the Coup Committee to fulfill the wishes of the Lao people.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 14th - According to Vientiane Radio broadcast this morning, Lieutenant Dun, Vice Chairman of the Lao Coup Committee, announced in a speech to all compatriots that since the Second Parachute Battalion rose up to seize power on August 9th to August 13th, it has received nine thousand two hundred and twenty-two letters, with signatures from eleven thousand and fifty-one people. The letter writers unanimously expressed the same feelings: warm support for the policies of the Coup Committee; vowing to live and die with the Coup Committee; and supporting the Coup Committee's policy of true neutrality. In particular, the letters all expressed the writers' urgent wishes, such as: do not retreat in the face of difficulties and dangers, carry out your plans to the end, and all of us are willing to work together to strengthen the Coup Committee and wish the Committee's plans to achieve the expected results.

In his speech, Lieutenant Dun said, "The Coup Committee is very pleased and grateful for the encouragement and support of our compatriots." He stated that the Coup Committee is willing to do everything to realize the people's wishes, which are: to defend the motherland, religion, the royal family, and the constitution. The Coup Committee will adhere to the principle of true neutrality based on the sincere wishes of the people and also the wishes of the committee.
