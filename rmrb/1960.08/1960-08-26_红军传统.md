　　Red Army Tradition
　　By our reporter Lei Lixing

　　Not far from Yongxin Street, you can see a row of neat factory buildings. On several tall chimneys are written large red characters: "Diligence and Thrift in Nation Building, Diligence and Thrift in Running Enterprises." This is the Yongxin County Red Army Steel Plant in Jiangxi Province. This steel plant, built from scratch by 111 veteran Red Army soldiers, has been a red banner on the iron and steel industry front in Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, for the past two years. It has been repeatedly commended and rewarded by the province, prefecture, and county, and also attended the National Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Industry, Transportation, and Basic Construction.

　　One Hundred and Eleven Red Hearts

　　The Red Army Steel Plant is composed of 32 veteran comrades who experienced the 25,000-li Long March and 79 second-class honorary soldiers. After the Party issued the call for a great leap forward in steel in September 1958, they carried their luggage and came to "Luanzang Mountain" (Mountain of Disordered Burials) in the suburbs of Yongxin County. At that time, they had no weapons. Around this desolate "Luanzang Mountain," they could not even find a broken house. Building materials and equipment were even more nowhere to be found. However, these veteran Red Army soldiers, tempered by years of hardship, relied on one hundred and eleven pairs of hands and one hundred and eleven red hearts, working together, diligently and thriftily, struggling hard, and overcoming all difficulties. Without bricks and wood, they searched everywhere for old bricks and waste materials; without transportation, they carried and hauled them; without blowing equipment, they went up the mountain to cut trees and build their own; without funds, they willingly did not receive compensation. In this way, they built an earthen blast furnace in three days, smelted the first batch of molten iron in seven days, and produced more than 170 tons of pig iron for the country in three months. They did not use a penny of state funds, and they did not touch the money allocated by the county for building houses. Instead, they found a dilapidated ancestral hall in Lijia Village, two miles away, which served as both housing and a kitchen.

　　Now the appearance of "Red Steel" has changed greatly. The plant has four small Bessemer furnaces, 34 pieces of equipment, and more than 20 factory buildings. Most of the production processes have been mechanized or semi-mechanized. In the first half of the year, it overfulfilled half of the annual task. In July, it achieved a substantial increase in production, setting a monthly production record for the past two years. However, the fine style of hard work and thrift practiced by all cadres here has not changed and has been further promoted. When I visited the workshop, I saw Comrade Qian Ranggu, the secretary of the Party committee of the plant. He was wearing work clothes, his hands and face covered with grease, working with the workers inside the machine, moving an engine. Zhou Erli, the chairman of the trade union, had bloodshot eyes and a bamboo pipe hanging from his waist. He was a veteran comrade who had experienced the 25,000-li Long March. Although he was already in his sixties, he still energetically participated in production and led production. Li Kaisheng, the Party branch secretary of the crushing workshop, was a veteran comrade with 26 years of Party membership. He always volunteered for the heavy work in the workshop. Li Ruifeng, the deputy director of the plant who led me on the tour, was barefoot, with a vest tucked into gray trousers and a cane polished to a shine in his right hand, replacing his right leg, which he lost for the revolutionary cause. Relying on one leg, he often went in and out of workshops, construction sites, dormitories, and canteens, diligently and conscientiously managing the plant's finances day after day for two years. After the visit, we returned to his office to rest. It was a small room with nothing but a self-made simple desk. At this time, his son brought him a portion of coarse rice and pumpkin vegetables from the canteen. The cadres of this plant all maintain the fine tradition of diligence and thrift of the old Red Army. The canteen has meat and vegetable dishes for every meal, but the cadres always let the workers eat the meat dishes and eat the vegetable dishes themselves.

　　The fine tradition of the old Red Army has had a profound impact on the workers. Hard work, diligence, thrift, and running enterprises diligently and thriftily have become the norm throughout the plant.

　　Putting Saving Manpower in an Important Position

　　The cadres and workers of "Red Steel" all know that people are the most valuable in the great leap forward of national construction. Therefore, they regard saving manpower as their sacred duty. In August 1959, after the Hechuan Iron Plant merged into the Red Army Steel Plant, the number of workers increased from 150 to 2,400, and the number of cadres also increased to 60. More people make things easier, and more cadres undoubtedly make work easier. However, the diligent and thrifty old Red Army cadres did not stick to the old ways. They started by actively improving leadership methods. The secretary of the Party committee, the director of the plant, and all cadres went to the workshops and ate, lived, worked, and discussed with the new workers to help the workers improve their ideological awareness and consciously participate in the various management tasks of the enterprise. On this basis, they took the initiative to request the county party committee to streamline the cadres. Now, the number of cadres in the plant has been reduced from the original 60 to 16, and the work is still done very well.

　　If one cadre can do the work of several people, why can't the workers? Thus, a technical innovation and technical revolution movement of one person doing the work of several people was launched among the workers. In order to save manpower and support agricultural production, the workers in the mining area used local materials and realized semi-mechanized production using bamboo and wood. It used to take half an hour to transport a load of ore down the mountain, but now it only takes two or three minutes, increasing efficiency by more than ten times. As a result, more than 200 people were transferred back to the agricultural front, and ore production more than doubled. Now, the number of workers in the plant is half of what it was last year, but pig iron production has doubled, the pig iron qualified rate has increased from 95% to more than 98%, the coke ratio has decreased by 30%, and the cost has also decreased by 70%.

　　Greater Potential for Savings with a Large Enterprise

　　With the increasing expansion of the factory's production scale, it is natural to add necessary equipment, tools, and utensils. However, the employees of "Red Steel" have made a big deal of the word "addition." They always take "self-reliance" as the main principle and "saving" as the top priority. For example, in order to meet the needs of production development, it is necessary to add a set of furnace enclosure wind pipes and hot blast furnace equipment, but purchasing these equipment requires 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. In order to save expenses, the employees of "Red Steel" set up their own foundry and used the iron they smelted to cast it, reducing the cost by more than one-third. Last winter, after the cadres and workers of the foundry researched the "direct casting" method, the molten iron smelted in the blast furnace could be directly cast into various equipment and castings such as furnace enclosures and wind furnaces, without having to go through the re-melting process of the melting furnace, saving manpower, fuel, and power machinery, and reducing the cost by more than half. Recently, the two sets of furnace enclosure wind pipes and other equipment they cast using the "direct casting" method saved more than 50,000 yuan in expenses.

　　Now, many of the raw materials needed by "Red Steel" can be solved by themselves, and the addition and repair of various tools and utensils are also taken care of by the plant's "omnipotent factory." In "Red Steel," everyone takes saving as an honor. The plant stipulates that each employee has very little public utility expenses every month, but every workshop has a surplus every month.

　　The Word "Waste" Does Not Exist Here

　　In "Red Steel," one can often hear the moving deeds of the old Red Army men who are "disabled but not useless." The former deputy director of the plant, Lan Shengyi, is a second-class honorary soldier. Although he only has one hand, he still goes up the mountain with the workers to cut bamboo and dig and transport ore. The spirit of "disabled but not useless" of the old Red Army men has given the people here a new understanding of the word "waste." Since there are no "useless" people, there are also no waste products. The waste gas discharged from the blast furnace is used by the employees to bake ore, becoming an important source of fuel saving. Utilizing the waste slag discharged from the blast furnace, the employees set up a slag cement plant, ensuring that all cement is self-sufficient. "Red Steel" also has several interesting factory buildings and dormitories: short houses, but with tall "chimneys" erected on the top. It turns out that these houses with "chimneys" are all small earthen iron-smelting furnaces from 1958. Since there are simple sheds next to the furnaces, after these small earthen furnaces completed their historical mission, the employees used these waste earthen furnaces and sheds to rebuild them into woodworking factories and dormitories, solving the housing problem for more than 200 employees and saving more than 10,000 yuan in construction funds.

　　Cherishing Every Bit of Labor

　　In "Red Steel," cherishing every bit of labor has become a common practice. When I visited the blast furnace workshop, I saw seven or eight young men swinging hammers and beating the still-smoking slag. Some were squatting on the ground, as if searching for needles under the moon, looking for something. A young man told me that they were carrying out the "Diligence and Thrift Love the Factory Day" activity. In each activity, one person has to pick up more than 100 kilograms of scrap iron. This young man also said that their slogan is "Careful calculation and careful collection, not a single grain is lost."

　　Hearing the familiar words "careful calculation and careful collection, not a single grain is lost" in the countryside in a steel plant felt particularly fresh. Within this fresh phrase lies a moving story. The matter occurred when "Red Steel" was just established. One day, furnace worker He Xili picked up a small iron grain at his feet. After careful observation, he found that there were many such small iron grains in the slag. When he told everyone about it, they all advocated picking these iron grains back. Thus, the slag produced by the previous shift was crushed and sieved by the next shift. Over time, people weighed the two large buckets of small iron grains they had picked up, and there were more than 2,000 kilograms. In this way, the system of picking iron from slag has been adhered to, and the workers regard it as a factory-loving activity.

　　He Xili, the discoverer of this small iron grain, is a veteran Red Army soldier who experienced the 25,000-li Long March.

    红军传统
    本报记者　雷力行
    出永新街不远，就可以看见一排整齐的厂房。几个高大的烟囱上，写着斗大的红字：“勤俭建国，勤俭办企业”。这就是江西永新县红军钢铁厂。这个由一百一十一名老红军战士白手起家建立的钢铁厂，两年来一直是江西永新县钢铁工业战线的一面红旗，曾经受到省、专、县多次表扬和奖励，还出席了全国工业、交通运输、基本建设方面先进集体和先进生产者代表会议。
          一百一十一颗红心
    红军钢铁厂是由三十二名经历过二万五千里长征的老同志和七十九名二等荣誉军人组成的。1958年9月党发出大搞钢铁运动的号召后，他们就携带行李，纷纷来到了永新县郊区的“乱葬山”上。那时，他们手无寸铁，在这荒芜的“乱葬山”周围，连一间破房子也找不到，建厂的材料和设备更是杳无着落。但是，这些久经艰苦岁月锻炼的老红军，依靠着一百一十一双手和一百一十一颗红心，同心协力，克勤克俭，艰苦奋斗，战胜了一切困难。没有砖块木料，他们就到处找旧砖废料；没有运输工具，他们就扛的扛来挑的挑；没有鼓风设备，他们就上山砍树自己造；没有资金，他们心甘情愿不领报酬。就这样，三天时间建起了一座土高炉，七天就炼出了第一炉铁水，三个月就为国家生产了一百七十多吨生铁。他们没用国家一个钱，县里拨给他们建房子的钱也分文未动，却在二里路远的李家村找了个破祠堂，又当住房，又当厨房。
    现在“红钢”的面貌已大大变样，全厂有小洋炉四座，设备三十四台，厂房二十多栋，生产过程大部分都实现了机械化、半机械化，上半年已超额完成全年任务的一半，7月份又取得了大幅度增产，创两年来月产最高纪录。然而，这里所有干部那种艰苦奋斗、克勤克俭的优良作风并未改变，而且得到了进一步发扬。我在车间访问时，看见了厂党委书记钱让谷同志。他身穿工作服，满手满脸沾着油腻，和工人们一道钻在机器里搬弄一台发动机。工会主席周俄俚，一双眼睛熬得通红，腰上挂着一根竹烟袋，他是经历过二万五千里长征的老同志，虽然已经年满花甲，仍然精神奕奕参加生产，领导生产。破碎车间党支部书记李开生，是个有着二十六年党龄的老同志，车间的重活他总是争着干。领我参观的副厂长李瑞凤，赤着脚，一件背心扎在灰色长裤里面，右手撑着一根磨得发光的拐杖，代替他那条为革命事业失去的右腿。他就凭着一条腿，经常出入车间、工地、宿舍、食堂，两年如一日地兢兢业业地掌管着全厂的财务。我们参观以后，回到他的办公室休息。这是一间狭小的房子，里面除了一张自制的简易办公桌以外，其他什么摆设也没有。这时，他儿子给他从食堂取来一份糙米饭、南瓜菜。这个厂的干部都是这样保持着老红军克勤克俭的优良传统。食堂里每餐有荤菜有素菜，干部们总是把荤菜让给工人吃，自己吃素菜。
    老红军的优良传统在工人中已经产生深远影响，艰苦奋斗、克勤克俭、勤俭办企业在全厂已成风气。
    把节约人力放在重要地位
    “红钢”的干部和工人们都知道，人在祖国各项建设大跃进中是最宝贵的。所以他们把节约人力看成是自己神圣的职责。1959年8月，禾川铁厂并入红军钢铁厂以后，工人由一百五十人增加到二千四百人，全厂干部也增加到六十人。人多好办事，干部多工作无疑更轻松，但是，克勤克俭的老红军干部并不因循苟安，他们从积极改进领导方法入手，厂党委书记、厂长和所有干部，都下到车间和新工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，帮助工人提高思想觉悟，自觉地参加了企业的各项管理工作。在这个基础上，他们便主动地向县委提出精简干部的要求。现在，全厂的干部已由原来的六十名减到十六名，工作同样干得很出色。
    干部一人顶几人，工人何尝不能？于是，在工人中展开了一个一人顶几人的技术革新和技术革命运动。矿区工人为了节省人力支援农业生产，在山上就地取材，运用竹木实现了半机械化生产，原来从山上运下一担矿石要半点钟，现在只要二、三分钟，提高工效十多倍。结果抽出了二百多人回到农业战线，矿石产量还增加一倍多。现在，全厂的工人比去年减少了一半，生铁产量却增加了一倍，生铁合格率由95％提高到98％以上，焦比下降了30％，成本也降低了70％。
    家大业大节约潜力更大
    随着工厂生产规模的日益扩大，添置必要的设备、工具、用器是理所应当的事。然而，就在这“添置”两个字上，“红钢”的职工们大做了文章。他们项项都以“自力更生”为主，以“省”字当头。例如，为了满足生产发展的需要，必须添置一套围炉风管和热风炉设备，但购置这些设备需要三、四万元。“红钢”的职工们为了节省开支，就自办了翻砂厂，用自己炼出的铁来铸造，使成本降低了三分之一以上。去年冬天，翻砂厂的干部和工人们研究出“直铸”的办法以后，高炉中炼出的铁水可直接铸成围炉、风炉等各种设备和铸件，不必经过化铁炉的重化过程，节省了人力、燃料和动力机械，使成本又降低一半多。最近他们用“直铸”办法铸造的两套围炉风管等设备，就节省了五万多元的开支。
    现在，“红钢”需要的许多原材料，都可以由自己解决，各种工具和用器的添置和修理，也都由厂里的“万能工厂”包了下来。在“红钢”，人人都以节约为荣，这个厂规定每月每个职工有很少的公杂费用，但个个车间还月月都有节余。
    这里不存在“废”字
    在“红钢”，经常可以听到工人们传颂老红军们“残而不废”的动人事迹。原副厂长蓝生意，是个二等荣誉军人。他虽然只有一只手，却同样和工人一道上山砍竹荷木、挖矿运矿。老红军们“残而不废”的精神，使这里的人们对“废”字有了新的理解。既然没有“废”人，同样没有废物。高炉里排出的废气，职工们把它用来焙矿，成了节约燃料的重要源泉。利用高炉内排出的废矿渣，职工们办起了矿渣水泥厂，保证水泥全部自给。“红钢”还有几栋有趣的厂房和宿舍：矮矮的房子，顶上却竖着高高的“烟囱”。原来，这些竖着“烟囱”的房子都是1958年的炼铁小土炉，由于炉旁架有简单的工棚，当这些小土炉完成了它的历史使命以后，职工们就利用了这些废土炉和工棚，改建成木工厂和宿舍，解决了二百多名职工的住房问题，节省了一万多元建设资金。
    珍惜每一分劳动成果
    在“红钢”，珍惜每一分劳动成果，已成为一种风气。当我访问高炉车间时，看见七、八个青年小伙子正在飞舞着鎯锤，敲打着还在冒气的炉渣，有的蹲在地上就像月下寻针似的在拣什么东西。一个小伙子告诉我，他们是在进行“勤俭爱厂日”活动，每次活动中一个人要拣回一百多斤碎铁块。这个小伙子还说，他们的口号是“精打细收，颗粒不丢”。
    “精打细收，颗粒不丢”这个在农村熟听的字眼，在钢铁厂里听到分外感到新鲜。就在这个新鲜的字眼里，蕴藏着一个动人的故事。事情发生在“红钢”刚刚成立的时候。一天，炉前工贺喜俚在脚下拣到一颗小铁粒，他仔细观察的结果，发现在炉渣中有许多这样的小铁粒，他向大家一说，都主张把这些铁粒拣回来。于是，上一班出的炉渣，下一班就敲碎过筛，久而久之，人们把拣回的两大桶小铁粒一称，足有两千多斤。这样，渣中淘铁的制度就一直坚持了下来，工人们并把它当作一项爱厂的活动。
    这颗小铁粒的发现者贺喜俚，正是经历过二万五千里长征的老红军。
