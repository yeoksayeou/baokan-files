    Expressing the Heroic Era of the People
    Wang Chaowen

    I

    Imperialists, in order to maintain the reactionary capitalist system and colonial rule, hate the proletarian revolution and also hate the literature and art that promotes the proletarian revolution and is beneficial to it. They slander socialist art as outdated and decadent, and they tout abstract art and other modernist art as the most advanced and newest art.

    What is new, what is old, what is advanced, what is backward, we have no common language with them; because this starts from two completely different worldviews, completely different service objects, and creative purposes. The abstract expressionism and other anti-animation schools currently popular in countries such as the United States advocate "thorough ambiguity," "planned chaos," "primitive instinct," "explosive emotion," and even use lips and bodies as brushes, letting donkeys, chimpanzees, bears, and roosters act as painters, which is what they call "new." In our opinion, this is by no means new, but only a concrete manifestation of the mental breakdown of the modern bourgeoisie approaching death. The imperialist monopoly capitalist groups use this so-called "art" to poison and deceive the people. Revisionists who serve imperialism, in order to oppose the proletarian revolutionary literature and art, on the one hand, advocate bourgeois humanism and pacifism, blurring the people's class consciousness and disintegrating the people's revolutionary will; on the other hand, they vigorously promote abstract expressionism and other anti-animation schools, promoting extreme individualism, pessimism, and decadent thinking. From this, we can see the most reactionary, dirtiest, and most corrupt essence of bourgeois art. The new we speak of refers to things that appear in the process of historical development and meet the needs of the advanced class. Our art is a part of the proletarian revolutionary cause, serving hundreds of millions of working people, praising the working people who create the world, and embodying the most advanced ideal—the communist ideal. It depicts themes that no great artist in history has ever depicted, and it shapes heroic images that no great artist in history could ever create. It is the most revolutionary and most combative art, and also the most creative art.

    The communist ideal is the most noble and advanced ideal of mankind. To embody this great ideal in the plastic arts is our most important and glorious task. We know that the plastic arts not only depict things that already exist in reality, but also express things that the people wish could exist; but does this mean that we must specifically depict the ideal future scene? Generally speaking, it is not necessary, at least this is not the main way. Communism is not out of reach for us. Communist factors are already being bred on a wider scale in the actual life of our socialist society; our artists can observe reality from the height of communist ideological consciousness, deeply understand the thoughts and feelings of advanced figures, and reflect them with enthusiasm, and their works can embody the communist ideal, inspire the people to yearn for a bright future, and encourage the people to contribute everything to a bright future.

    I believe that the mass creations that appeared in 1958, which people have repeatedly praised, are works full of revolutionary romanticism, that is, works that clearly embody revolutionary ideals; the works in the "Waist-Cutting the Yellow River" sketch exhibition recently exhibited in Beijing, these simple construction site sketches, although the style and the farmer murals full of cartoon colors are completely different, it should be said that they also possess the spirit of revolutionary romanticism and entrust revolutionary ideals. Whether it is like "World-Shaking Creation" (Shandong Art Academy), choosing the climax of the transformation of the Yellow River, the tense scene of interception and closure, depicting the magnificent and emotional boiling scene on the construction site; whether it is like "Meeting Relatives on the Dam" (Lv Xueqin), depicting the feelings of pride of the families of the migrant workers in the face of the miracles created by their relatives, they all praise the heroic spirit of the working people who work selflessly to build a strong socialist country. Those works depicting the new socialist life in ethnic minority areas, such as the Chinese painting "Singing and Dancing" (Huang Zhou), the sculpture "Million Serfs Stand Up" (Guo Qixiang), the oil painting "The Road to Happiness" (Ma Changli), the prints "Plateau Gorge" (Li Huanmin), "The East is Red, the Sun Rises" (Niu Wen), and "First Grade of Night School" (Wu Fan), not only express the significant changes in all aspects of the current socialist motherland and the changes in the people's spiritual outlook, but also contain revolutionary ideals.

    Art that serves workers, peasants, and soldiers must be rich and diverse. We advocate depicting major events that can summarize the face of the times and embody communist ideals, such as expressing the noble qualities of Qiu Shaoyun, Xiang Xiuli, An Yemin... who are infinitely loyal to the Party and the proletarian cause in severe struggles and are willing to sacrifice. At the same time, we also welcome works that take many new things happening in daily life as themes, such as depicting children who have gone to school teaching their mothers to read, traffic police taking children from kindergartens across the road, and midwives visiting the children she delivered. Because these new things can also reveal the new relationship between people in the new society and can express the spiritual outlook of new characters. In short, the requirements that are conducive to promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie, that are conducive to the improvement of communist moral qualities, that do not violate the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and that can cultivate the people's healthy aesthetic taste, the themes that can be depicted are very broad. But we do not advocate depicting trivial matters of life that have no social significance and cannot reflect the face of the times, such as a bride waiting for her husband is dressing up, a young girl is sitting by the river playing in the water, and a girl with something on her mind is staring at a pair of butterflies in a daze, and so on. We disapprove even more of works that, under the pretext of depicting the lives of the working people, do not express the beauty of the working people, but instead entrust base tastes. Because that is completely contrary to the requirements of embodying advanced ideals.

    The themes of art should be diversified, but various things have different positions and social meanings in reality, so the themes have primary and secondary distinctions in diversification, and it cannot be said that all themes are equally important. The primary and secondary distinction of themes is determined by the objective reality of society. To examine the primary and secondary distinctions of various things in the reality of the socialist construction period, we must start from the situation and tasks of the proletarian revolutionary struggle during the current socialist construction period in order to draw correct conclusions that conform to the laws of development of objective things. Only by recognizing that the three red banners are the dominant and decisive aspects of our domestic reality can we judge politically what themes are important and worth focusing on in creation; what themes are of little significance and not worth putting in an important position; and what themes are harmful to the people and must be resolutely opposed and cannot be depicted at all. However, when discussing the primary and secondary of themes, some people actually use sophistry to steal and replace the concept of contradiction transformation, abstract the historical conditions of the socialist construction period, and arbitrarily and unconditionally confuse the primary and secondary things together, while denying the main contradiction under certain historical conditions, and draw the conclusion that there is no primary and secondary distinction between the trivial matters in life and the major events in socialist construction. This kind of saying that this is important and that is important, that it is like this and also like that, and that all themes are equally important, actually elevates the secondary things and lowers and negates the important significance of major events in socialist construction. This theory is a reflection of eclecticism and relativistic philosophical thought on literary and artistic issues, and this is an extremely harmful theory. If we accept this view that themes are not divided into primary and secondary, then it will inevitably reduce and negate the requirement to correctly express workers, peasants, and soldiers first; obliterate the importance of artists going deep into the fiery struggle of workers, peasants, and soldiers, blur the political direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and the socialist construction cause, and weaken or even cancel the combat role of fine arts in the ideological struggle.

    In order to complete the great and glorious political tasks entrusted to us by the Party and the people, improve the socialist and communist ideological consciousness and moral qualities of all the people, and thoroughly eliminate the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, we must adhere to the literary and artistic direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and we must wage a resolute struggle against all kinds of bourgeois ideas that distort the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and actually blur the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    II

    In the practice of revolutionary struggle, the working people have transformed the world and also transformed themselves. The working people of the new era who have stood up are new people with high spirits, high morale, and high fighting spirit. The communist ideal is specifically embodied in the actions of these new characters and their love, hate, demands, and wishes. Whether it is depicting class struggle or production struggle; whether it is depicting current themes or historical themes; whether it is depicting events of revolutionary success or events of temporary setbacks in the revolution; whether it is depicting the specific circumstances of the struggle or depicting the results of the struggle and its impact on people's spirits; no matter what style and form is used, and no matter what the artist's personal style is, as long as they can accurately, vividly, and vividly express the revolutionary spiritual qualities of advanced figures, they can have a positive impact on the people's spirits and improve the people's thinking and moral qualities. China's art works are paying more and more attention to portraying the spiritual outlook of new characters, which is a very good phenomenon.

    Under the Party's in-depth leadership, the creatively reflected sculpture "Long Live the People's Commune" (Luxun Academy of Fine Arts) is a good work that has adapted to the characteristics of the plastic arts and concentrated on expressing the spiritual outlook of the people in the new era. Drawing on the strengths of certain aspects of traditional sculpture, these two round sculptures, which have formed a brand-new style, are composed of farmer images full of confidence, high spirits, and courage to move forward, with young people playing drums or cymbals as the apex, forming a whole that combines momentum and stability, expressing optimism full of confidence in the future, contempt for all difficulties in a powerful and majestic image, expressing the heroic feelings of the working people in the new era who have achieved great achievements in the revolutionary cause, and expressing the revolutionary drive of the working people to show their talents in new undertakings. Such sculptures are not only the crystallization of the spiritual outlook of the people in the new era, but also the embodiment of the people's revolutionary desire for a continuous great leap forward. The oil painting "First Shooting" (Liu Qing) also provides valuable experience in portraying the spiritual outlook of advanced figures. As far as the plot is concerned, the character is most concerned about how to improve shooting skills. However, the author does not regard painting this plot as the purpose of painting, but uses it to express the revolutionary's enthusiastic concern for his new comrades, and praises the class friendship and collectivist spirit of advanced figures, thus avoiding the shortcomings of seeing things but not people. "Cable Workers Tackle Cutting-Edge Technology" (Luxun Academy of Fine Arts) also depicts themes related to technological revolution, but it does not induce viewers to care about specific technical issues, but vividly depicts the expressions of the inventors of the new era who are all for the technological revolution.

    "Blood Clothes" (Wang Shikuo), "Five Warriors of Langya Mountain" (Zhan Jianjun), "Delivering Food" (Liu Qing), and many works depicting the struggle against the enemy, choose plots in which contradictions and conflicts are sharpened, thereby vividly portraying the spiritual outlook of revolutionaries. "Blood Clothes" is a work depicting the land reform movement, which focuses on expressing the spirit of struggle of the people who have turned over against the reactionary class. With the woman who holds up the blood-stained clothes and is in a state of grief and anger as the apex of the whole picture, it summarizes the deep-seated hatred of many farmers who share the same fate as her and who have also become class-conscious for the oppressors and exploiters.

    The spiritual outlook of new characters is manifested in all aspects of life, and artists should start from all aspects to describe it. It can start from the depiction of sharp contradictions and conflicts, or it can be expressed through the depiction of some other life phenomena. Even portrait paintings and portrait sculptures, which are not characterized by the depiction of characters' actions and require a high degree of generalization, can also express the brilliant spiritual outlook of advanced figures. The New Year picture "Heroes Meet" (Lin Gang) depicts the meeting of people's leaders and heroic models, deeply expressing the infinite concern of the great Comrade Mao Zedong for the people, and deeply expressing the people's love and respect for their leaders. People's leaders are the concentrated expression of the spiritual beauty of proletarian revolutionaries. How to creatively express the spirit of the great and wise people's leaders, who represent the noble qualities of the proletariat, in portrait paintings and portrait sculptures, is an important political task. The Chinese painting "Chairman Walks All Over the Country" (Li Qi) is a creative portrait painting of the leader. The author does not attempt to rely on plots, but attempts to rely on specific demeanor, actions, expressions, and clothing to express the important characteristics of Chairman Mao going deep among the masses, and to embody several important aspects of the rich spiritual outlook of the great leader.

    The attitude of the people of the new era towards labor, the selection of materials and the way of expression can also be diverse. The female worker working intently in "Female Electrician" (Zhang Longji), the soldiers who are agile and cheerful in "Rice Transplanting" (Lin Ling), the farmers who are still walking in the fields late at night in "Three O'Clock in the Morning" (Jia Yiqun), as well as "On the Canal" (Wang Xuyang) and "Dawn Calls for Crossing the River" (Ji Meihun), one depicts the workers on the boat looking forward to the construction site, and the other depicts the workers who go to work early waiting for the boat at the dock, all of which praise their positive attitude towards labor to varying degrees. These works also express the spiritual outlook of new characters and are conducive to the improvement of communist moral qualities.

    Since the Great Leap Forward, many excellent works depicting the transformation of nature have emerged. Some of them, like "Moving Mountains and Filling Valleys" (Li Shuoqing), "On the Huaibei Plain" (Yi Zhensheng, Zhang Hong, Shi Songling), "Boating in Shenmen" (Xie Ruijie) and other works, directly depict the grand and enthusiastic scenes of the working people fighting against nature. Some works start from the achievements of labor and praise the revolutionary spirit of the working people to a certain extent. For example, the print "Inside and Outside the Great Wall" (Liu Kuang) focuses on depicting the new face of the desert area. Windbreaks and paddy fields, which were originally unrelated to the desert, are now prominently contrasted with sand dunes in the print. The fantasy of turning the desert into fertile land has become a reality. Through the depiction of this inspiring miracle, it praises the revolutionary spirit of the working people to transform nature. Very neat terraced fields, like reservoirs, have become special roles in landscape paintings of the new era. The terraced fields in the prints "Spring in Northern Shaanxi" (Xiu Jun), "Greening" (Chen Jiayong), and the Chinese painting "Baihua Mountain" (Central Academy of Fine Arts) are all decorated with decorative interest in color and shape, attracting attention with their neat beauty. These works make people feel that the author is enthusiastically praising the infinite creativity and great wisdom of the working people. This kind of landscape painting can make people appreciate the new China's people's desire, confidence, determination, and strength to overcome nature, and can make people appreciate the revolutionary ideals and revolutionary heroism of the working people who are determined to change the backward face of our country's "poverty and blankness."

    Not only works that reflect social life and the struggle between man and nature should express the spiritual outlook of the working people, but landscape paintings and flower and bird paintings that reflect natural beauty should also express the thoughts and feelings of the working people in the new era and reveal the working people's aesthetic ideals. This is the purpose of landscape paintings and flower and bird paintings in the socialist era. Those landscape paintings that depict the majesty and magnificence of the motherland's mountains and rivers, such as "The Country Is So Beautiful," reflect the people's love and pride for the motherland to a certain extent. Those arguments that simply regard landscape paintings and flower and bird paintings that reproduce natural beauty as merely reproductions of nature, rather than as reflections of the people's rich spiritual outlook, are one-sided, wrong, and unfavorable to the development of the proletarian art cause.

    III

    Heroes of the new era have emerged in large numbers, and the communist spirit is flourishing. Why is it still required to typify new people and new things in art? Regarding this, Comrade Mao Zedong made a brilliant summary when discussing the characteristics and functions of art. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that literature and art is to "concentrate everyday phenomena, typify the contradictions and struggles in them, and create literary works or artistic works, which can awaken the masses of people, inspire them, and promote the masses of people to unite and struggle, and transform their own environment."

    In order to educate the people, artists must resolutely reject naturalistic art methods and oppose passively, rigidly, and negatively recording phenomena. We must strive to master the art method of combining revolutionary realism with revolutionary romanticism, and shape artistic images that are higher, stronger, more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal than ordinary actual life, and therefore more universal, and fully reveal the revolutionary ideals of the artist.

    The issue of typification also reflects the struggle between bourgeois and proletarian literary and artistic thought. Modern revisionists and bourgeois artists, in order to oppose the service of the plastic arts to the proletarian revolutionary cause and abolish the role of the Marxist worldview in artistic creation, also use the excuse that the plastic arts are visual arts, opposing the depiction of reality and idealization, opposing the authenticity of artistic images and the requirements for embodying revolutionary ideas, opposing intuition and thinking, sensory knowledge and rational knowledge, and even openly declaring that only depiction is needed, not conception. This is an extremely reactionary argument.

    To create types in the plastic arts, it is of course necessary to adapt to the characteristics of the plastic arts, and to use the description of instantaneous phenomena to attract attention to describe the most important and most representative characteristics of the object's character. It is not possible to simplify the generalization method, to depart from the concreteness of the object, and to make the characters typified. However, even portrait paintings and portrait sculptures must be generalized and concentrated, and the materials must be creatively processed. The extent to which the processing is done depends on whether the image can fully express the creative intention of the proletarian artist. In Lu Xun's words, it is "enough to almost completely express my meaning." Lu Xun's "my meaning" is of course not something independent of the image, but is closely combined with the specific theme, the artist's feelings, judgments, and wishes about things.

    Since literature and art is a form of ideology, we can fully affirm that purely objective reflection of life does not exist, including naturalistic works. Saying that a work is purely objective is just to cover up something subjective. The shaping of images is inevitably subject to the artist's position, point of view, and specific creative intentions. China's traditional painting theory emphasizes that art must start from actual life, but opposes being拘泥于事实; praising good works as "巧夺天工," and criticizing those works that "谨毛而失貌"; all this is not only for the vividness of the image; not only for expressing emotions through things, but also to fully express the painter's thoughts and achieve the purpose of "成教化，助人伦." Today, revolutionary artists who aim to educate the people with socialist and communist ideas, when he creates artistic images, must focus on expressing those things that can best represent the characteristics of the class and the era, abandoning those trivial things that hinder the theme, and using bright colors to describe the life of our heroic era. "Contemporary Heroes" (Central Academy of Fine Arts Affiliated High School), in order to focus on expressing the spiritual outlook of heroic figures in the new era, is not restricted by the concreteness of the material, and boldly imagines and constructs a magnificent and solemn picture. The whole picture takes the people's leader as the center, depicting the heroic models who have made meritorious contributions in the great revolutionary cause, that sense of pride that can control the development of reality, that spiritual state full of firm belief in the new victory of socialist construction, and that feeling of great happiness and unparalleled glory generated by approaching the great leader.

    In order to embody clear revolutionary ideals, it is necessary to create typical images that unify individuality and class nature. To create this kind of image, artists must give play to creative imagination. Only with the help of imagination can artists not only describe people as they are, but also describe people as they should be and will inevitably be. Therefore, from the perspective of the typification and idealization of images, imagination is not only a right of the artist, but also an obligation of the artist.

    The process of the artist giving play to imagination is also the continuation of his understanding of reality. Whether or not one can give play to creative imagination is a test for the artist. If the artist does not combine with the working people and does not possess a communist worldview, it is impossible to talk about correctly giving play to imagination. The farmers of the Great Leap Forward are full of revolutionary ideals, so their works can correctly give play to imagination and are full of revolutionary romanticism. Some people associate the farmer murals since the Great Leap Forward with bourgeois modern formalist art, believing that they are both works full of fantasy. This kind of generalized and indiscriminate statement actually blurs the essential differences between the ideological forms of different classes. The fiction of bourgeois modernist art is unfounded speculation divorced from reality, a game of extreme individualism and idealism, a distortion of reality, and a manifestation of the increasingly impoverished loss of artistic creativity and imagination. And the revolutionary romanticist fiction of farmer murals is a manifestation of the high degree of expression of creative imagination. This kind of imagination is based on and premised on the rapidly developing reality, and is the product of the vigorous development of revolutionary ideals. In a higher sense, this is a deeper reflection of real life illuminated by revolutionary ideals, so we say that it is a manifestation of the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism.

    To solve the problem of how to give play to imagination and shape types, we must first solve the problem of worldview.

    Taking revolutionary war as the theme, it is possible to appropriately give play to imagination and shape brilliant and splendid types that inspire the people to move forward, and it is also possible to distort reality and uglify revolutionary figures. The sculpture "Hard Times" (Pan He), the oil paintings "Chairman Mao in Northern Shaanxi" (Gao Hong), "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" (Ge Sha), etc., neither ignore the arduous side of the struggle, nor take the expression of arduousness as the purpose, but to praise the revolutionary optimistic spirit, and relatively deeply express the revolutionary fighters' firm belief and the perseverance to overcome powerful class enemies and natural obstacles. However, some of China's works with revolutionary war as the theme, such as "Transfer" and "In the Days of Anti-'Sweep'" (Wang Liuqiu), "Home" (Qin Zheng), render the just people's revolutionary war with a terrifying, cruel, gloomy, and decadent tone, and depict the soldiers and people who are heroic, indomitable, and full of optimistic spirit in the struggle against the enemy as war-weary, pessimistic, and full of contradictions and pain in their hearts. This distorts the spiritual outlook of the people with revolutionary ideals. The seriousness of the problem also lies in the fact that modern revisionists use the viewpoint of "human nature theory" to beautify this fact, believing that those works full of strong sentimentalism and pessimism are in line with "humanitarianism"; believing that those who distort the image of revolutionaries and depict revolutionaries of noble character and strong will as cowards who are nostalgic for personal happiness and afraid of sacrifice and death are in line with "human feelings." We must strictly criticize such works and remarks that threaten the people, disintegrate the people's fighting spirit, are beneficial to the imperialists, and are harmful to the great cause of defending peace.

    The application of artistic methods is closely related to the artist's position and point of view. Whether or not it can successfully shape the types of new characters representing the advanced forces and express their brilliant spiritual outlook, the fundamental problem lies in whether the artist himself possesses communist ideas. The great achievements of China's socialist art are inseparable from the ideological transformation of artists. To solve the problem of how to shape types, we must first solve the problem of the artist's worldview. Comrade Lu Dingyi, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, called on us in his congratulatory message at the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers: "Constantly transform our own thinking, constantly improve our communist ideological consciousness and moral qualities, firmly establish a proletarian worldview, and constantly eliminate the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie in our ranks." For the greater leap forward of art creation, in order to deeply express the noble spiritual outlook of the heroes in political struggle and on the production front, and to embody proletarian revolutionary ideals, we must resolutely implement the Party's call and redouble our efforts to complete the important tasks assigned to us by the Party!

    表现人民群众的英雄时代
    王朝闻
    一
    帝国主义者，为了维护反动的资本主义制度和殖民主义统治，仇视无产阶级革命，也仇视宣传无产阶级革命和有利于无产阶级革命的文学艺术。他们污蔑社会主义艺术是过了时的陈腐的艺术，他们标榜抽象主义等现代派艺术是最先进的最新的艺术。
    什么叫做新，什么叫做旧，什么叫做先进，什么叫做落后，我们和他们之间没有共同的语言；因为这是从两种完全不同的世界观、完全不同的服务对象和创作目的出发的。目前在美国等国家流行的抽象表现派等反动画派，提倡“彻底的含糊”、“有计划的混乱”、“原始的本能”、“爆发的感情”，甚至把嘴唇和身体当成画笔，让毛驴、猩猩、狗熊、公鸡充当画家，就是他们所谓的“新”。在我们看来，这绝不是什么新，只不过是接近死亡的现代资产阶级精神崩溃的一种具体表现。帝国主义垄断资本家集团，就是利用这种所谓“艺术”来毒害人民和欺骗人民的。给帝国主义服务的修正主义者，为了反对无产阶级的革命文艺，一方面鼓吹资产阶级的人道主义、和平主义，模糊人民的阶级意识，瓦解人民的革命斗志，一方面极力提倡抽象主义等反动画派，宣传极端个人主义、悲观主义和颓废主义的思想。从这里，我们可以看到资产阶级艺术最反动、最肮脏和最腐朽的实质。我们所说的新，是指一定历史发展过程中出现的符合先进阶级需要的东西。我们的艺术，是无产阶级革命事业的一部分，是为千百万劳动人民服务的，是歌颂创造世界的劳动人民、体现最先进的理想——共产主义理想的。它描写的是历史上任何大艺术家都没有描写过的题材，它塑造的是历史上任何大艺术家都创造不出的英雄的形象。它是最革命、最富于战斗力的艺术，也是最富于创造性的艺术。
    共产主义理想是人类最崇高最先进的理想。在造型艺术中体现这一伟大的理想，是我们最重大最光荣的任务。我们知道，造型艺术不只是描写在现实中已经存在的事物，而且表现人民愿望中的可能存在的事物；但是，这是不是说，必须具体描绘理想中的未来景象呢？一般说来，不必这样，至少这不是主要的方式。共产主义对我们说来不是远不可及的，在我们社会主义社会的实际生活里，已经在更广阔的范围内孕育了共产主义因素；我们的艺术家能够站在共产主义思想觉悟的高度来观察现实，深入体会先进人物的思想感情，热情饱满地加以反映，其作品就有可能体现共产主义理想，就能够启发人民向往光辉灿烂的未来，鼓舞人民为光辉灿烂的未来贡献一切力量。
    我以为出现在1958年的、人们一再称赞过的群众创作，是富有革命浪漫主义色彩的作品，即分明体现了革命理想的作品；不久之前在北京展出的“腰斩黄河”写生画展览会里的作品，这些朴素的工地写生画，尽管风格和富于漫画色彩的农民壁画完全不同，应该说也是具备了革命浪漫主义精神、寄托了革命理想的。不论是像《举世奇创》（山东艺专）那样，选择改造黄河这一巨大工程的高潮，截流堵口的紧张场面，描写工地上那种气势雄伟、情绪沸腾的景象；不论是像《拦河坝上会亲人》（吕学勤）那样，描写民工的家属面对着亲人们所创造的奇迹而感到自豪的感情，都歌颂了劳动人民建设强大的社会主义国家而忘我地劳动的那种英勇豪迈的精神。那些描写少数民族地区社会主义新生活的作品，例如中国画《载歌行》（黄胄）、雕塑《百万农奴站起来》（郭其祥）、油画《幸福之路》（马常利）、版画《高原峡谷》（李焕民）、《东方红太阳升》（牛文）、《夜校一年级》（吴凡），也是不只表现了当前的社会主义祖国各方面的显著变化和人民精神面貌的变化，而且蕴藏着革命的理想的。
    为工农兵服务的艺术必须是丰富多样的。我们提倡描写那些能够概括时代面貌、体现共产主义理想的重大事件，例如表现丘少云、向秀丽、安业民……在严酷的斗争中对党、对无产阶级事业无限忠诚、不惜牺牲的高贵品质。同时我们也欢迎以日常生活中发生的许多新事物为题材的作品，比如描写上了学的孩子教母亲识字，交通警察把幼儿园的孩子带过马路，接生员探望由她接生下来的孩子等。因为这些新事物也能够揭示新社会的人和人之间的新的关系，能够表现新人物的精神面貌。总之，有利于兴无灭资的要求，有利于共产主义道德品质的提高，不违背毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中所提出的六项政治标准，能够培养人民健康的审美趣味，可以描写的题材非常广阔。但是我们不提倡描写那些没有什么社会意义，不能反映时代面貌的生活琐事，比如说等待丈夫的新娘子正在修饰容貌，年轻的姑娘正坐在河边戏水，有心事的姑娘默默地盯着一对蝴蝶发呆等等。我们更不赞成借口描写劳动人民的生活，却不表现劳动人民的美，而是寄托卑琐趣味的作品。因为那是和体现先进理想的要求完全背道而驰的。
    艺术的题材应当是多样化的，但各种事物在现实中的地位和社会意义不同，所以题材在多样化之中又有主次之分，不能说什么题材都同等重要。题材的主次之分，是由社会的客观现实所决定的。考察社会主义建设时期现实中各种事物主要次要的区别，必须从当前社会主义建设时期无产阶级革命斗争的形势和任务出发，才能得出符合客观事物发展规律的正确结论。只有认识到三面红旗是我们国内现实生活中主导的、决定性的方面，才能从政治上判断在创作中什么题材是重要的，值得着重描写的；什么题材是意义不大、不值得放在重要地位的；什么题材是于人民有害的、必须坚决反对、根本不能描写的。可是有人在谈论题材的主要次要时，竟然用诡辩的方法，偷换矛盾转化的概念，抽掉了社会主义建设时期这一历史的条件，把主要的和次要的事物随意地无条件地混同在一起，而否认了在一定历史条件下的主要矛盾，得出生活中的琐事和社会主义建设中的大事没有主要次要区别的结论。这种认为这也重要，那也重要，既是这样，又是那样，什么题材都同等重要的说法，实际上是抬高了次要的事物，降低和否定了社会主义建设中重大事物的重要意义。这种理论，是折衷主义和相对主义哲学思想在文艺问题上的反映，这是极有害的理论。如果接受这种题材不分主次的观点，那就必然会降低和否定首先正确表现工农兵这一革命的要求；抹煞艺术家深入工农兵火热斗争的重要性，模糊为工农兵、为社会主义建设事业服务的政治方向，削弱甚至取消美术在意识形态斗争中的战斗作用。
    为了完成党和人民所赋与我们的伟大而光荣的政治任务，提高全体人民的社会主义、共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质，彻底清除资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响，我们必须坚持为工农兵服务的文艺方向，必须和那些曲解党的百花齐放政策、实际上模糊工农兵方向的各种各样的资产阶级思想作坚决的斗争。

    在革命斗争的实践中，劳动人民改造了世界，也改造了自己。站立起来了的新时代的劳动人民，是精神振奋、意气风发、斗志昂扬的新人。共产主义理想，就具体地体现在这些新人物的行动和他们的爱憎、要求、愿望之中。不论是描写阶级斗争，还是描写生产斗争；不论是描写当前的题材，还是描写历史的题材；不论是描写革命成功的事件，还是描写革命暂时遭到挫折的事件；不论描写斗争的具体情况，还是描写斗争的成果和它在人们精神上的影响；不论是用什么体裁和样式，也不论是艺术家的个人风格如何，只要能够准确、鲜明、生动地把先进人物的革命精神品质表现出来，都可能在人民精神上产生积极的影响，提高人民的思想和道德品质。我国的美术作品，愈来愈注意刻划新人物的精神面貌，这是很好的现象。
    在党的深入领导之下，创造性地反映了现实的雕刻《人民公社万岁》（鲁迅美术学院）就是适应了造型艺术的特点，集中表现了新时代的人民群众的精神面貌的好作品。吸取了传统雕塑某些方面的长处，形成了崭新气派的这两座圆雕，由那些充满信心、精神抖擞、勇往直前的农民形象所组成，以打鼓或打钹的青年为顶点，构成了动势和安定感相结合的整体，在力量充沛、气势雄浑的形象里，表现了对未来充满信心、藐视一切困难的乐观主义精神，表现了新时代劳动人民在革命事业中获得伟大成就的豪迈情感，表现了劳动人民将在新的事业中大显身手的革命干劲。这样的雕刻不只是新时代人民精神面貌的结晶，而且是人民持续大跃进的革命愿望的化身。油画《第一次射击》（柳青），在刻划先进人物精神面貌方面，也提供了可贵的经验。就情节而论，人物最关心的是怎样提高射击技术。然而作者不是把画出这一情节当成作画的目的，而是借此表现革命者对于他的新同志的热情的关怀，颂扬先进人物的阶级友爱和集体主义精神，因而避免了见事不见人的缺点。《电缆工人攻尖端》（鲁迅美术学院），描写的也是有关技术革命的题材，但它也不是诱导看画的人关心具体的技术问题，而是出色地描写了新时代的工人发明家们一切为了技术革命的神情面貌。
    《血衣》（王式廓）、《狼牙山五壮士》（詹建俊）、《送饭》（柳青）和许多描写对敌斗争的作品，是选择了矛盾冲突尖锐化的情节，从而鲜明地刻划革命者的精神面貌的。《血衣》是一幅描绘土改运动的作品，它着重表现的是翻身的人民那种对反动阶级的斗争精神。以高举血衣，情绪悲愤的妇人的控诉为全画的顶点，概括了许多和她的命运相同也都是有了阶级觉悟的农民，对于压迫者和剥削者的刻骨仇恨。
    新人物的精神面貌表现在生活中的各个方面，艺术家应该从各个方面着手加以描写。可以从尖锐的矛盾冲突和斗争的描写着手，也可以借一些别的生活现象的描写来表现。即令是不以人物行动的描写为特色、需要具有高度概括性的肖像画和肖像雕刻，也同样可以表现先进人物光辉灿烂的精神面貌。年画《群英会上》（林岗）描写的是人民领袖和英雄模范的会见，深刻地表现了伟大的毛泽东同志对于人民的无限关怀，深刻地表现了人民对于自己的领袖的敬爱。人民领袖是集中地表现了无产阶级革命者的精神美的，怎样在肖像画和肖像雕刻中，把伟大的英明的人民领袖那种代表了无产阶级崇高品质的精神创造性地表现出来，是一个重要的政治任务。中国画《主席走遍全国》（李琦），是一幅有创造性的领袖肖像画。作者不企图依靠情节，而是企图依靠特定的神态、动作、表情和服装来表现毛主席深入群众这一重要特征，体现出伟大领袖丰富的精神面貌的若干重要方面。
    表现新时代的人民的劳动态度，取材和表现方式也可以是多种多样的。《女配电工》（张隆基）里聚精会神工作的女工，《插秧》（林聆）里那些动作敏捷、精神愉快的士兵，《三更时分》（贾宜群）里深夜还在田间行进的农民，另如《运河上》（王绪阳）和《晨曦呼渡图》（吉梅魂），一个是描写劳动者在船上向往着工地，一个是描写提早上工的劳动者在码头上等船，这一切，都在不同程度上歌颂了他们对劳动的积极态度。这些作品也表现了新人物的精神面貌，有利于共产主义道德品质的提高。
    大跃进以来，出现了不少描写改造大自然的优秀作品。有的是像《移山填谷》（李硕卿）、《在淮北平原上》（易振生、张弘、师松龄）、《神门放舟》（谢瑞阶）等作品那样，直接描写劳动人民在怎样和自然作斗争的轰轰烈烈的情景。有的作品，从劳动的成果着手，在一定程度上歌颂了劳动人民的革命精神。例如版画《长城内外》（刘旷），着重描写的是沙漠地带的新面貌。防风林带和水田，这本来和沙漠不沾边的东西，如今在版画里引人注目地和沙丘成了鲜明的对比。沙漠变良田的幻想成了现实。通过这一振奋人心的奇迹的描绘，歌颂了劳动人民改造大自然的革命气概。非常整齐的梯田，像水库那样，成了新时代的风景画的特殊角色。版画《陕北的春天》（修军）、《绿化》（陈嘉墉）和中国画《百花山》（中央美术学院）里的梯田，色彩和造型都富有装饰趣味，以整齐的美引人注目。这些作品使人觉得，作者是在热情地称赞劳动人民那种无穷的创造力和伟大的智慧。这种风景画能够使人体会新中国人民战胜自然的渴望、信心、决心和力量，能够使人体会劳动人民一定要改变我国“一穷二白”落后面貌的革命理想和革命英雄主义精神。
    不仅反映社会生活、反映人和自然斗争的作品，要表现劳动人民的精神面貌，反映自然美的风景画、花鸟画，也应该表现新时代劳动人民的思想感情，揭示劳动人民的美的理想。这是社会主义时代的风景画以及花鸟画的目的。那些描写了祖国山河的雄伟、瑰丽的风景画，例如《江山如此多娇》，在一定程度上反映了人民对祖国的热爱和自豪的感情。那种把再现自然美的风景画、花鸟画简单地看成只是自然的再现，而不看成是人民丰富的精神面貌反映的论调，都是片面的、错误的、不利于无产阶级艺术事业的发展的。
    三
    新时代的英雄已经大量涌现，共产主义精神正在蓬勃发展，为什么还要求在艺术里把新人、新事典型化呢？关于这，毛泽东同志在论艺术的特征和作用时，作了精辟的概括。毛泽东同志指出，文艺是把“日常的现象集中起来，把其中的矛盾和斗争典型化，造成文学作品或艺术作品，就能使人民群众惊醒起来，感奋起来，推动人民群众走向团结和斗争，实行改造自己的环境”。
    为了教育人民，艺术家必须坚决排斥自然主义艺术方法，反对被动地、死板地、消极地记录现象。必须力求掌握革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法，塑造比普通的实际生活更高、更强烈、更有集中性、更典型、更理想，因而更带普遍性的艺术形象，充分揭示艺术家的革命理想。
    关于典型化的问题，也反映了资产阶级和无产阶级文艺思想的斗争。现代修正主义者和资产阶级文艺家，为了反对造型艺术为无产阶级的革命事业服务，取消马克思主义的世界观在艺术创作中的作用，他们还借口造型艺术是视觉的艺术，把现实的描绘和理想化对立起来，把艺术形象的真实性和体现革命思想的要求对立起来，把直觉和思维、感性认识和理性认识对立起来，甚至公然宣称只要描绘，不要构思，这是极端反动的论调。
    在造型艺术里创造典型，当然必须适应造型艺术的特长，利用瞬间现象的描写，惹人注意地描写对象性格中最主要的最有代表意义的特征。不能把概括的方法简单化，离开了对象的具体性，使人物类型化。但是，连肖像画和肖像雕刻在内，都必须进行概括和集中、对素材进行创造性加工。加工到什么程度，要看形象能不能充分表现无产阶级艺术家的创造意图。用鲁迅的话来说，就是“足以几乎完全发表我的意思为止”。鲁迅所说的“我的意思”，当然不是独立于形象之外的东西，而是和特定的题材密切结合在一起的，艺术家对于事物的感受、判断和愿望。
    文艺既是一种观念形态，我们完全可以肯定，包括自然主义作品在内，纯客观地反映生活的情况是不存在的，把作品说成是纯客观的东西，不过是为了掩盖某种主观。形象的塑造，不可避免地要受艺术家的立场、观点和特定的创造意图所支配。我国传统的画论，讲究艺术必须从实际生活出发，却又反对拘泥于事实；称赞好作品“巧夺天工”，批判那些“谨毛而失貌”的作品；这一切不只为了形象的传神；不只为了借物抒情，而且也是为了充分表达画家的思想，达到“成教化，助人伦”的目的。今天，以社会主义、共产主义思想教育人民为奋斗目标的革命艺术家，当他创造艺术形象的时候，必须着重表现那些最能代表阶级和时代特征的东西，舍弃那些琐碎的妨碍主题的东西，用鲜明的色彩描写我们英雄时代的生活。《当代英雄》（中央美术学院附中）为了集中表现新时代英雄人物的精神面貌，所以才不受素材的具体性所限制，大胆设想，构成了规模宏伟、气象庄严的画面。全画以人民领袖为中心，描写那些在伟大的革命事业中建立功勋的英雄模范那种能够左右现实发展的自豪感，那种对社会主义建设的新胜利充满坚定信念的精神状态，那种由于接近了伟大的领袖而产生的极大幸福和无比光荣的感情。
    为了体现鲜明的革命理想，必须创造个性和阶级性统一的典型形象。要创造这种形象，艺术家必须发挥创造性的想像。只有借想像的帮助，艺术家才能作到不只把人描写成现有的模样，而且把人描写成应有和必然会有的模样。因而从形象的典型化和理想化来考察，想像不只是艺术家的一种权利，而且也是艺术家的一种义务。
    艺术家发挥想像的过程，也就是他认识现实的继续。能不能发挥创造性的想像，对艺术家来说，是一种考验。如果艺术家不和劳动人民相结合，不具备共产主义世界观，根本谈不到正确发挥想像。大跃进的农民是富于革命理想的，因而他们的作品就能正确地发挥了想像，充满了革命浪漫主义精神。有人把大跃进以来的农民壁画和资产阶级现代形式主义艺术联系起来，认为它们都是富于幻想的作品，这种笼统的不加区别的说法，实际上模糊了不同阶级的观念形态的本质区别。资产阶级现代派艺术的虚构，是脱离实际的胡思乱想，是极端个人主义和唯心主义的游戏，是对于现实的歪曲，也是丧失了艺术的创造性和想像力愈来愈贫乏的表现。而农民壁画这种革命浪漫主义的虚构，是创造性的想像得到了高度发挥的表现。这种想像是以迅速发展中的现实为基础和前提的，是革命理想蓬勃发展的产物。农民为了颂扬大跃进的规模、速度和干劲，特别是为了表现继续大跃进的强烈愿望，不满足于现象的平板的记录，突破了现象的如实描写。就更高的意义而论，这是在革命理想照耀下的现实生活更深刻的反映，所以我们说它是革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的表现。
    要解决怎样发挥想像、塑造典型的问题，首先要解决世界观的问题。
    以革命战争为题材，能够适当发挥想像，塑造鼓舞人民前进的光辉灿烂的典型，也可能歪曲现实，丑化革命人物。雕塑《艰苦岁月》（潘鹤）、油画《毛主席在陕北》（高虹）、《星火燎原》（戈沙）等等，既不忽视斗争艰苦的一面，又不把表现艰苦作为目的，而是为了颂扬革命乐观主义精神，比较深刻地表现了革命战士坚定的信念，战胜强大的阶级敌人和自然障碍的毅力。但是我国的某些以革命战争为题材的作品，例如《转移》和《在反‘扫荡’的日子里》（王流秋）、《家》（秦征），却把正义的人民的革命战争渲染上恐怖的、惨酷的、灰暗而消沉的色调，把对敌斗争中那些英勇不屈、充满乐观主义精神的战士和人民，描绘成厌战的、悲观失望的、内心充满矛盾和痛苦的人物，这就歪曲了有革命理想的人民的精神面貌。问题的严重性还在于：现代修正主义者用“人性论”的观点来美化这一事实，认为那些充满了浓厚的感伤主义和悲观主义情绪的作品，是合乎“人道主义”的；认为那些歪曲了革命者的形象，把品质高贵、意志坚强的革命者描写成留恋个人幸福、害怕牺牲和死亡的懦夫的作品，才是合乎“人情”的。我们必须严格批判这种恐吓人民、瓦解人民斗志，于帝国主义者有益，于保卫和平的伟大事业有害的作品和言论。
    艺术方法的运用，和艺术家的立场观点密切联系着。能不能成功地塑造代表先进力量的新人物的典型，表现他们那种光辉灿烂的精神面貌，根本问题在于艺术家自己是不是具有共产主义思想。我国社会主义美术的巨大成就，和美术家的思想改造分不开。解决怎样塑造典型的问题，首先要解决艺术家世界观的问题。陆定一同志代表党中央和国务院在全国第三次文代大会上所作的祝词中号召我们：“不断改造自己的思想，不断提高自己的共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质，巩固地树立起无产阶级的世界观，不断清除自己队伍中的资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响。”为了美术创作的更大跃进，为了深刻表现在政治斗争中和生产战线上的英雄们那种崇高的精神面貌，体现无产阶级革命理想，我们必须坚决贯彻党的号召，加倍努力，完成党所交给我们的重大任务！
