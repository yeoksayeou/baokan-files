Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 23rd: The Eighth National Congress of the Cuban People's Socialist Party concluded yesterday evening.

Wu Xiuquan, representative of the Chinese Communist Party and member of the Central Committee of the CPC, Rodney Arismendi, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uruguay, Duclos, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, Paul Verner, Secretary of Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German United Socialist Party, and Blas Roca, General Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, spoke at the closing ceremony.

In his speech at the closing ceremony, Wu Xiuquan, representative of the Chinese Communist Party, pointed out that the victory of the Cuban people's revolution has set a brilliant example for the people of all countries in the struggle for independence and democracy. He said, "The victory of the Cuban people has supported and encouraged the struggles of the people of all countries, and the people of all countries have also supported the Cuban revolution. In your struggle to defend and advance the revolution, in your just struggle against US imperialism, the Chinese people will always stand with you. Premier Zhou Enlai said in his statement on August 15th, 'The Chinese people firmly support the heroic Cuban people in their just struggle against US imperialist aggression and to safeguard national sovereignty.' 'The Chinese people are willing to provide the Cuban people, who are fighting for independence and freedom, with all possible assistance without any conditions attached…'"

Wu Xiuquan said that the Chinese government and the Chinese people love peace and have made unremitting efforts to safeguard peace, ease international tensions, and strive for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and will continue to implement this correct policy and make contributions. However, US imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan and is still trying its best to threaten the Cuban revolution. The common struggle closely unites the people of all countries, and the common struggle unites the Chinese people and the Cuban people. We firmly believe that in the common struggle against imperialism, the people of all countries can unite and support each other. Wu Xiuquan said that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are confidently striving to build their country into a powerful socialist country with modern industry and agriculture and modern science and culture in a not-too-long period. China's industrial development will complete the course of industrial development that capitalist countries have taken for one or two hundred years in a relatively short period of time. China's economic development will contribute to maintaining world peace and supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries.

Referring to the trade and payment agreements that China and Cuba have recently signed, Wu Xiuquan expressed his conviction that the friendly cooperation between China and Cuba in all fields will be further developed.

Wu Xiuquan's speech was repeatedly interrupted by prolonged and enthusiastic applause, and people enthusiastically shouted the name of Mao Zedong. Before and after his speech, the whole audience stood up and shouted "Long live the People's China."

Arismendi, who spoke at the closing ceremony on behalf of the fraternal parties of Latin American countries, emphasized the importance of this congress for the Cuban revolution and the unity of the revolutionary forces in Cuba. Arismendi said that the Cuban revolution "ignited a fire in the hearts of the people of our countries, calling on them to fight." In his speech, Arismendi spoke of the support of Latin American countries for Cuba, and of the 24-hour general strike of 200,000 Uruguayan workers on the opening day of the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Organization of American States in support of Cuba and against the US-instigated conspiracy to interfere in Cuba, and the 24-hour strike of 40,000 students on that day for the same purpose.

Duclos, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, said when speaking on behalf of the communist and workers' parties of European capitalist countries, "People now see from the example of Cuba that even if the US imperialists are strong, they cannot suppress Cuba at will." Duclos emphasized, "In order to support your struggle against US imperialism, we will intensify our struggle against US imperialism everywhere to express our fraternal support."

Paul Verner, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German United Socialist Party, spoke on behalf of the fraternal parties of European socialist countries. He exposed the imperialists' attempt to use Berlin as a hotbed for a new world war. Paul Verner praised the Cuban revolution's contribution to the national liberation movements of various countries. He focused on the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union for the Cuban people.

Blas Roca, General Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, in his final speech at the closing ceremony, expressed his deep gratitude to the delegations of fraternal parties and the people of all countries for their support of the Cuban revolution. After analyzing the current situation in Cuba, he said that in order to defend and advance the revolution, the Cuban People's Socialist Party and the Cuban people have four main tasks: to strengthen the unity of all revolutionary forces; to increase production and improve labor productivity; to strengthen national defense; and to raise revolutionary consciousness. He said that relying on the unity of all revolutionaries, the preparation of the entire people, and the support of the people of all countries, the Cuban people will surely defeat the threat of aggression from US imperialism. At the plenary meeting held yesterday afternoon, the general resolution of the congress was adopted.

Blas Roca summarized the discussions of the congress at the meeting on the 21st. At the meeting, the Party's National Committee, composed of thirty-seven members and four alternate members, was also elected. At the first meeting held at the end of the meeting, the new National Committee elected the Executive Bureau composed of Blas Roca, Aníbal Escalante, Manuel Lusado, and other comrades.

    伍修权说中国人民永远同古巴人民站在一起
    罗加说古巴人民必将战胜美帝国主义的侵略
    新华社哈瓦那23日电　古巴人民社会党第八次全国代表大会昨天晚上举行了闭幕式。
    中国共产党代表、中共中央委员伍修权、乌拉圭共产党中央第一书记阿里斯门迪、法国共产党中央书记处书记杜克洛、德国统一社会党中央书记处书记保罗·维尔纳和古巴人民社会党总书记布拉斯·罗加在闭幕会上讲了话。
    中国共产党代表伍修权在闭幕式上的讲话中指出，古巴人民取得的人民革命的胜利，为世界各国人民争取独立和民主的斗争做出了光辉的榜样。他说，“古巴人民的胜利支持和鼓舞了世界各国人民的斗争，而世界各国人民也支持了古巴革命。在你们保卫和推进革命的斗争中，在你们反对美帝国主义的正义斗争中，中国人民永远同你们站在一起。周恩来总理在本月15日的谈话中说，‘中国人民坚决支持英勇的古巴人民反对美帝国主义侵略，维护国家主权的正义斗争’。‘中国人民愿意给为独立自由而斗争的古巴人民一切可能的援助而不附带任何条件……’”
    伍修权说，中国政府和中国人民热爱和平，为保卫和平和缓和国际紧张局势，争取不同社会制度的国家之间的和平共处作了不懈的努力，并将继续执行这个正确的方针，作出贡献。但是，美帝国主义仍然侵占着我国的领土台湾，仍然千方百计地威胁古巴革命，共同的斗争使各国人民紧密地团结在一起，共同的斗争把中国人民和古巴人民团结在一起。我们深信，在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，世界各国人民能够团结起来，能够互相支援。伍修权说，中国人民在共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下正满怀信心地要在不太长的时期内把自己的国家建设成一个拥有现代工业和农业、现代科学文化的强大的社会主义国家。中国的工业发展将在比较短的时间内走完资本主义国家工业发展走了一二百年的路程。中国的经济发展将为维护世界和平和支援各国人民的革命斗争做出贡献。
    伍修权提到最近中国和古巴已经签定的贸易和支付等协定时，表示确信：中国和古巴在各方面的友好合作将获得进一步的发展。
    伍修权的讲话一再被长时间的热烈的掌声所打断，人们热情地高呼毛泽东的名字。在他讲话前后全场起立高呼“人民中国万岁”的口号。
    代表拉丁美洲各国兄弟党在闭幕式上讲话的阿里斯门迪强调指出了这次大会对古巴革命以及古巴革命力量的团结的重要意义。阿里斯门迪说，古巴革命“在我们各国人民的心中燃起了一把火，号召他们去进行斗争”。阿里斯门迪在讲话中谈到了拉丁美洲各国对古巴的支援，谈到了在美洲国家组织外长会议开幕那一天乌拉圭二十万工人为支持古巴、反对美国策动干涉古巴的阴谋所举行的二十四小时总罢工，以及四万学生在那一天为着同样的目的举行的二十四小时的罢课。
    法国共产党中央书记处书记杜克洛在代表欧洲资本主义国家的共产党和工人党讲话时说，“人们现在从古巴的榜样中看到，美帝国主义者即使再强大也不能随心所欲地把古巴镇压下去。”杜克洛强调说，“为了支援你们反对美帝国主义的斗争，我们将在各地加紧进行反对美帝国主义的斗争，这样来表达我们的兄弟般的支持。”
    德国统一社会党中央书记处书记保罗·维尔纳代表欧洲社会主义国家的兄弟党讲话。他揭露帝国主义者企图利用柏林作为新的世界大战的策源地。保罗·维尔纳赞扬了古巴革命对各国人民的民族解放运动的贡献。他着重谈到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营对古巴人民的支援。
    古巴人民社会党总书记布拉斯·罗加在闭幕式上最后讲话时，对各兄弟党代表团和世界各国人民对古巴革命的支援表示深切的感谢。他在分析古巴目前的形势之后说，为了保卫和推进革命，古巴人民社会党和古巴人民有四项主要任务：加强一切革命力量的团结；增加生产和提高劳动生产率；加强国防；提高革命觉悟。他说，依靠一切革命者的团结、全体人民的准备和世界各国人民的支援，古巴人民必将战胜美帝国主义的侵略威胁。在昨天下午举行的全体会议上，通过了代表大会的总决议。
    布拉斯·罗加在21日的会议上总结了大会的讨论。会上还选出了由三十七名委员和四名候补委员组成的党的全国委员会。新的全国委员会在会议结束时举行的第一次会议上，选出了由布拉斯·罗加、阿尼瓦耳·埃斯卡兰特、曼努埃尔·卢萨多和其他同志组成的执行局。
