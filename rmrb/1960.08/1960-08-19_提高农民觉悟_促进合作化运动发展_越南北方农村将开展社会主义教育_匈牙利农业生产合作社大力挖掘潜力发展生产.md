Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 17th. Currently, the pilot work of socialist education in rural areas in the northern provinces of Vietnam has ended and achieved good results. In order to basically complete agricultural collectivization this year, northern Vietnam is about to widely conduct socialist education for agricultural cadres, rural Labor Party members, agricultural production cooperative members, and the masses.

According to reports in the local newspapers, during the pilot work, farmers were mobilized to recognize the superiority of collectivization and the benefits brought by the Labor Party by using comparison methods, which further raised farmers' awareness. When farmers in Hung Thai Township, Nghe An Province, discussed the contributions made by the people of the township to the revolution and the benefits the revolution brought to the people of the township, many people used their own families as examples to compare the changes before and after the revolution and wrote these changes down for an exhibition in the village. After the discussion, everyone had a deeper understanding of the Labor Party's policies and expressed their determination to resolutely follow the Labor Party.

On the basis of increased understanding, some farmers who had not yet joined agricultural cooperatives requested to join, and all agricultural cooperatives in Bao Chuan Township, Nam Dinh Province, expanded after the education. At the same time, some problems existing in the agricultural cooperatives were resolved, further consolidating the agricultural cooperatives.

The "People's Daily," the organ of the Vietnamese Labor Party, in an editorial entitled "Do a Good Job in the Autumn Education Movement in Rural Areas," called on all localities to ensure that cadres, party members, and the masses can have profound ideological changes in this education work, further enhance their fighting spirit, resolutely overcome difficulties, and basically realize agricultural collectivization this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 18th. Since the beginning of this year, agricultural production cooperatives in Hungary have been paying close attention to tapping their own potential, striving to develop and consolidate the cooperatives with their own strength, and have achieved certain results in this regard.

This year, the national agricultural production cooperatives have invested 430 million forints in construction themselves, accounting for about one-quarter of the total investment in developing agricultural production cooperatives. By July, in addition to the assistance of national construction enterprises, the cooperatives' own construction teams had built various cattle sheds capable of accommodating more than 2,000 dairy cows and more than 1,700 buffaloes, pigsties capable of accommodating more than 10,000 fattening pigs, and chicken coops capable of raising more than 500,000 chickens. In this way, the problem of public livestock sheds for collective livestock raising was solved in a timely manner. In addition, the members actively participated in public construction work such as beautifying the countryside, digging canals and wells, and building roads, schools, and kindergartens.

At present, almost all agricultural cooperatives have their own construction teams. In Solnok County alone, the members of the agricultural cooperative construction team reached thousands of people, and they undertook construction tasks worth 30 to 40 million forints this year. The characteristics of these construction teams are simplicity and low cost.

Newly established cooperatives need a large number of agricultural machines. While the state provides support in many ways, production cooperatives also use the cooperatives' public accumulation fund to purchase machines. From the beginning of this year to July 10, agricultural production cooperatives in Hungary have purchased more than 2,000 tractors and more than 3,500 agricultural machines towed by tractors. Most of them were purchased by the cooperatives with their own funds.

    提高农民觉悟　促进合作化运动发展
    越南北方农村将开展社会主义教育
    匈牙利农业生产合作社大力挖掘潜力发展生产
    新华社河内17日电　目前，越南北方各省在农村中进行社会主义教育的试点工作已经结束，并取得了良好的成绩。为了在今年内基本上完成农业合作化，越南北方即将对农业干部、农村的劳动党党员、农业生产合作社社员和群众广泛进行社会主义的教育。
    据此间报纸报道，各地在试点工作中，发动农民通过对比的方法，来认识合作化的优越性和劳动党给自己带来的好处，进一步提高了农民的觉悟。义安省兴泰乡农民在讨论全乡人民为革命作出了那些贡献、革命给全乡人民带来什么好处等问题时，许多人都以自己的家庭为例，对比革命前与革命后发生的变化，并且把这些变化写出来在村里举行展览。经过讨论，大家对劳动党的政策有了更深刻的认识，都表示一定坚决跟着劳动党走。
    在认识提高的基础上，一些尚未加入农业社的农民纷纷要求入社，南定省保川乡经过教育，所有的农业社都有了发展。同时，农业社存在的一些问题也得到了解决，进一步巩固了农业社。
    越南劳动党机关报“人民报”在题为“作好农村秋季教育运动”的社论中，要求各地在这次教育工作中，使干部、党员和农民群众在思想上能有深刻的转变，进一步提高斗志，坚决克服困难，在今年内基本上实现农业合作化。
    新华社布达佩斯18日电　匈牙利各地农业生产合作社今年以来很注意挖掘本身的潜力，努力用自己的力量来发展和巩固合作社，并在这方面取得了一定的成绩。
    今年，全国农业生产合作社自己投入建设的资金达四亿三千万福林，约占发展农业生产合作社的投资总额的四分之一。到7月为止，除了国家建筑企业的帮助外，合作社自己的建筑队共修建了能容纳二千多头奶牛和一千七百多头水牛的各种牛舍、能容纳一万多头肥猪的猪圈和能饲养五十多万只鸡的鸡舍。这样，就及时地解决了集体饲养牲畜的公共畜舍问题。此外，社员们还积极参加了美化农村、开渠挖井、修建公路、学校、幼儿园等公共建设工作。
    目前，各个农业合作社差不多都有自己的建筑队。仅索尔诺克一州，农业合作社的建筑队队员就达数千人，他们今年承担了价值三、四千万福林的建筑任务。这些建筑队的特点是因陋就简，成本很低。
    新成立的合作社需要大量农业机器。在国家多方面的支持的同时，生产合作社也用社的公积金来购买机器。从今年年初到7月10日为止，匈牙利各农业生产合作社已经购买了二千多台拖拉机和三千五百多台用拖拉机牵引的农业机器。其中大部分都是合作社用自己的资金买的。
