Xinhua News Agency, August 1st: Brigadier General Aung Gyi, the Chief Representative of the Burmese side of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee and Deputy Chief of Staff of the Burmese Defense Forces, held a farewell banquet tonight before returning to his country.

Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier of the State Council Marshal Chen Yi, and Vice Premier of the State Council and Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Luo Ruiqing were invited to attend the banquet.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the banquet. He first pointed out that the Burmese delegation of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee, headed by Brigadier General Aung Gyi, had carried out fruitful work during this round of talks in Beijing. Premier Zhou expressed his gratitude to the Burmese delegation for this.

Premier Zhou expressed his agreement with what Brigadier General Aung Gyi said at the banquet: that there are two types of countries in the world, one type advocates peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and the other relies on a policy of strength to carry out aggression, expansion, and threats of war; the former is a good medicine, and the latter is poison. Premier Zhou pointed out that all countries that carry out aggression, expansion, and threats of war are equal to taking poison and will inevitably suffer the consequences. Historical facts prove that any country that carries out a war of aggression will ultimately fail.

Premier Zhou said that the development of friendly relations between China and Burma proves that countries with different social systems can achieve peaceful coexistence as long as both sides have a sincere desire for peace and friendship and make continuous efforts to overcome existing and future difficulties. The friendly relations between China and Burma set a good example for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems in the world.

Premier Zhou pointed out that among countries with social systems different from China's, Burma has always been at the forefront of expressing friendship towards China. Burma was one of the first countries to recognize China, the first country to conclude a treaty of friendship and non-aggression with China based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and will be the first country to conclude a boundary treaty with China. Premier Zhou happily mentioned the friendly exchanges that China and Burma have already conducted and will conduct since the beginning of this year. Premier Zhou said that this year, the relations between China and Burma have entered a new stage, and this year can be called the China-Burma Friendship Year.

Premier Zhou said that in 1954, Prime Minister U Nu said that the people of China and Burma should build a great mansion of Sino-Burmese peace and friendship. That year, we jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and conducted mutual visits, laying the foundation for this mansion. From 1954 to now, this great mansion of peace and friendship between the people of China and Burma is about to be completed. Now, we are looking forward to Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win coming to our country to cut the ribbon for the completion ceremony of this mansion.

Brigadier General Aung Gyi spoke at the beginning of the banquet. He said that the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee has completed the major task stipulated in the agreement on the Sino-Burmese boundary issue, according to the wishes of the two governments and the two peoples.

He said that now, our Joint Committee has begun to draft a new Sino-Burmese boundary treaty that will replace the old treaty and include the currently determined boundary line.

Brigadier General Aung Gyi said that regarding this boundary issue, some people may doubt whether it can be easily resolved, and some people believe that no matter how friendly the two countries are and no matter how much they understand and concede to each other, according to general rules, the meeting will last a long time, but we have solved the problem very quickly. He said that everyone should not think that we have not encountered difficulties because of this. The reason why we are now able to overcome difficulties and achieve such great and brilliant achievements is because we firmly believe in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and do everything possible to adhere to and implement these principles in practice. At the same time, we have a firm determination to find ways to solve all problems and overcome difficulties.

Brigadier General Aung Gyi said that between neighboring countries, there will always be some problems at some point. Similarly, in international affairs, such and such problems will also arise. There are two ways to solve these problems: either solve them peacefully, or solve them by sacrificing millions of people. He said that as we seek what is the most effective remedy for solving this problem, some countries have shown that this remedy is to adopt the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China and Burma are the first to show that this is the best remedy. If we start from the size of the country, the strength of the armed forces, and the abundance of resources, and act on the principle of the strong bullying the weak, it can only be said to be creating a poison that sacrifices the lives of millions of people. Brigadier General Aung Gyi also warmly praised the deep feelings that the Burmese government and people and the Chinese government and people have for each other.

When Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the banquet, he expressed warm congratulations on the significant achievements made by the second meeting of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee. He said that the second meeting of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee reached agreements on various major issues that were satisfactory to both parties. This fact more profoundly embodies the spirit of equality and friendship of mutual understanding, mutual accommodation of difficulties, and mutual concessions between two independent sovereign states that have only recently been freed from the oppression and plunder of imperialism. This spirit further promotes and enhances the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by our two countries, and further proves that it can withstand the test of practice.

Vice Premier Chen Yi then said that this further strengthened our original belief that no matter how major and complex international issues are, as long as the parties concerned follow the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and in the spirit of friendly cooperation, mutual understanding, and mutual concession, a fair and reasonable solution can be obtained through peaceful consultation.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said with full confidence that Prime Minister U Nu's active initiative to come to our country on October 1 this year to sign the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty is entirely possible to realize. We express our warm welcome to the upcoming visit of Prime Minister U Nu and other Burmese dignitaries.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government, expressed his condolences to the Burmese delegation headed by Brigadier General Aung Gyi for their hard work in Beijing, and expressed his respect and condolences to all the staff of the Sino-Burmese Joint Survey Team who are working tirelessly in the field.

The Chinese and Burmese people who attended the banquet continuously applauded the speeches of Premier Zhou, Brigadier General Aung Gyi, and Vice Premier Chen Yi, and repeatedly raised their glasses to congratulate the success of the second meeting of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee, to wish for the early signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, and to wish for the eternal friendship of the people of China and Burma like relatives.

Also invited to attend the banquet were: Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Geng Biao, Generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Zhang Aiping, Gan Siqi, Lieutenant Generals Xiao Xiangrong, Tan Jiasu (Air Force), Zhao Qimin (Navy), our Ambassador to Burma Li Yimang, Chief Representative of the Chinese side of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee Yao Zhongming, President of the China-Burma Friendship Association Zhang Youyu, as well as Chinese representatives and advisors of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee.

Representatives of the Burmese delegation, Burmese Ambassador to China Kyaw Winn, and other representatives, advisors, and staff attended the banquet. (Attached picture)

    周恩来总理在昂季准将告别宴会上讲话
    中缅友好关系是和平共处的范例
    昂季准将说用和平共处五项原则解决国际事务问题是有效良药
    陈毅副总理盛赞双方会谈中互相谅解互相照顾困难互相让步的平等友好精神
    新华社1日讯　中缅边界联合委员会缅甸首席代表、缅甸国防军副总参谋长昂季准将，在返国前夕于今晚举行了告别宴会。
    国务院总理周恩来，国务院副总理陈毅元帅，国务院副总理、中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿大将，都应邀出席了宴会。
    周恩来总理在宴会上讲了话。他首先指出，中缅边界联合委员会缅甸方面以昂季准将为首的代表团，这次在北京会谈中进行了有成果的工作。周总理为此向缅甸代表团表示感谢。
    周总理表示同意昂季准将在这个宴会上所说的，世界上有两类国家，一类国家主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处；另一类国家依靠实力政策进行侵略扩张和战争威胁；前一种是良药，后一种是毒药。周总理指出，所有进行侵略扩张和战争威胁的国家等于吃毒药，必将自食其恶果。历史事实证明，凡是进行侵略战争的国家，最后总是要失败的。
    周总理说，中缅两国友好关系的发展证明，不同社会制度的国家只要双方都具有对于和平友好的真诚愿望，并且进行不断的努力，就可以克服已经存在的和将要发生的困难，实现和平共处。中缅两国的友好关系为世界上不同社会制度国家的和平共处树立一个良好的典范。
    周总理指出，在同中国的社会制度不同的国家中，缅甸总是领先对中国表示友好的。缅甸是这些国家中首先承认中国的一个国家，是首先根据和平共处的五项原则同中国缔结友好和互不侵犯条约的国家，又将是首先同中国缔结边界条约的国家。周总理高兴地提到今年年初以来，中缅两国已经进行的和即将进行的友好来往。周总理说，今年中缅两国的关系进入了新的阶段，今年可以称为中缅友好年。
    周总理说，1954年吴努总理曾经说过，中缅两国人民应该建筑起一座中缅和平友好大厦，那一年我们共同倡导了和平共处五项原则，相互进行了访问，为这一座大厦奠了基。从1954年到现在，这座中缅两国人民的和平友好大厦即将建成了。现在，我们在期待着吴努总理和奈温将军来我国为这座大厦的落成典礼剪彩。
    昂季准将在宴会开始时讲话。他说，中缅边界联合委员会根据两国政府和两国人民的愿望，完成了关于中缅边界问题的协定所规定的重大任务。
    他说，现在，我们联合委员会已经开始起草一项取代过去旧条约、把目前确定的界线包括在内的新的中缅边界条约。
    昂季准将说，关于这一边界问题，某些人或许会怀疑是否能很容易解决，某些人认为无论两国怎样友好，无论两国怎样互谅互让，根据一般规律，会议将开很久，但是我们已经很迅速地解决了问题。他说，大家不应该因此就以为我们没有遇到困难。我们现在所以能够克服困难而获得如此巨大而辉煌的成就，是由于我们深信和平共处五项原则，并且尽一切可能在实践中坚持贯彻这些原则。同时以坚定的毅力寻找解决一切问题和克服困难的办法。
    昂季准将说，相邻的国家之间，总会在某个时期存在一些问题的。同样在国际事务中也会产生这样或那样的问题。要解决这些问题有两种办法：要么用和平的方法解决，要么用使千百万人牺牲的方法解决。他说，在我们寻求什么是解决这问题最有效的良药时，有些国家已经表明，这服良药就是采用和平共处五项原则。我们中缅两国正是最先表明了这是最好的良药。如果说以国家的大小、武装力量的强弱、资源的丰富与否为出发点，以强欺弱的原则行动，这只能说是制造使千百万人民牺牲生命的毒药。昂季准将还热情称道缅甸政府和人民同中国政府和人民彼此都寄于深厚的感情。
    陈毅副总理在宴会上讲话时，对中缅边界联合委员会第二次会议取得的重大的成就，表示热烈的祝贺。他说中缅边界联合委员会第二次会议就各项重大问题达成了双方都感到满意的协议。这个事实更加深刻地体现了不久以前才摆脱了帝国主义的压迫和掠夺的两个独立主权国家之间互相谅解、互相照顾困难、互相让步的平等友好的精神。这种精神使我们两国所共同倡导的和平共处五项原则更加发扬光大，更加证明了它是经得起实践的考验的。
    陈毅副总理接着说，这就进一步加强了我们双方原有的信念，即无论什么重大复杂的国际问题，只要有关双方遵循和平共处五项原则，本着友好合作、互谅互让的精神，无不可以通过和平协商求得公平合理的解决。
    陈毅副总理满怀信心地说，吴努总理准备在今年10月1日到我国来签订中缅边界条约的积极倡议是完全有可能实现的。我们对吴努总理和其他缅甸贵宾们即将进行的访问，表示热烈的欢迎。
    陈毅副总理代表中国政府向昂季准将为首的缅甸代表团在北京所进行的辛勤工作表示慰问，并且向正在野外不辞辛劳地工作的中缅边界联合勘察队全体工作人员，表示敬意和慰问。
    出席宴会的中缅两国人士对周总理、昂季准将和陈毅副总理的讲话，不断报以热烈的掌声，并且一再举杯，祝贺中缅边界联合委员会第二次会议的成功，祝中缅边界条约早日签订，祝中缅两国人民亲戚般的友谊万世长存。
    应邀出席宴会的还有：外交部副部长章汉夫、耿飚，中国人民解放军张爱萍上将、甘泗淇上将、萧向荣中将、谭家述空军中将、赵启民海军中将，我国驻缅甸大使李一氓，中缅边界联合委员会中国首席代表姚仲明，中缅友好协会会长张友渔，以及中缅边界联合委员会中国代表、顾问等。
