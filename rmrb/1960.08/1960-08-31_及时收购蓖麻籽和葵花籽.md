    Promptly Purchase Castor Seeds and Sunflower Seeds
    This spring, the broad masses of people in both urban and rural areas enthusiastically responded to the state's call and widely carried out a mass movement to plant castor beans and sunflowers on vacant land. The amount planted was more than in any previous year. After several months of careful management and hard work, the harvest season has now arrived. All localities should seize the opportunity and immediately launch a high tide of harvesting and selling, picking the ripe castor seeds and sunflower seeds and enthusiastically selling them to the state to support national construction.
    Castor and sunflowers are small oilseed crops planted in a scattered and piecemeal manner. They may not seem significant, but we must not underestimate their role. As a result of widespread planting in various places in recent years, these small oilseeds have increasingly become an important source of oil crops in our country. In addition to a small portion being used for edible purposes, these small oilseeds have great industrial uses. In particular, castor seeds can be used not only to manufacture pesticides, paints, soaps, printing oils, and pharmaceutical raw materials, but also as an indispensable raw material for high-grade lubricating oils. Their economic value is very high.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, the industrial sector's need for oils and fats has grown rapidly, and this year's industrial needs are expected to grow significantly more than last year. To purchase these small oilseeds as quickly as possible is of great significance for promoting the development of industrial production. At the same time, the broad masses of urban and rural people can increase their income by selling these oilseeds to the state. Therefore, doing a good job in the timely harvesting and purchasing of castor seeds and sunflower seeds can not only further meet the state's needs for oils and fats, but also meet the demands of the broad masses.
    Currently, both harvesting and selling must be timely. In areas where crops mature early, harvesting and selling should be done simultaneously. It is necessary to harvest and pick as soon as they ripen, harvesting each plant as it ripens, leaving no plant unharvested and not losing a single seed. The reason why harvesting must be emphasized as timely is that castor seeds are crops that flower, bear fruit, and ripen in batches. Timely harvesting can avoid the unnecessary losses caused by the automatic cracking and falling off of ripe fruits. Timely selling can allow these small oilseeds to be transported to cities for processing and put on the market as soon as possible to meet the needs of industrial departments. The key to achieving timely harvesting and selling lies in making good arrangements for labor. All localities should rationally allocate labor under the principle of ensuring that agricultural production is not affected by the need for labor, closely integrate with the central work, widely mobilize social forces, and make use of gaps in time to actively harvest. Like during planting, the broad masses of young people should continue to be shock troops in harvesting and selling, taking the lead in selling castor seeds and sunflower seeds to the state.
    Grain and commercial departments responsible for the purchase of castor seeds and sunflower seeds should strive to do a good job in the purchase. First of all, based on the characteristics of these small oilseeds being planted in a scattered and piecemeal manner, a variety of purchasing methods should be adopted. In rural areas, on the one hand, purchasing points and agency purchasing points should be widely established, and on the other hand, efforts should also be organized to visit households for purchasing. In cities, existing grain supply points should be organized to vigorously purchase. Do not dislike small amounts, do not be afraid of trouble, collect all amounts, collect both good and bad, and achieve "pricing according to quality, cash transactions," providing convenience for the masses to sell everywhere. In the purchase, all localities must conscientiously implement the income distribution policy that collective planting benefits the collective, and individual planting benefits the individual, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of the broad masses to sell. While doing a good job in purchasing, grain and commercial departments should also do a good job in seed retention, so as to prepare sufficient seeds for continuing to expand the planting of castor beans and sunflowers next year.

### 及时收购蓖麻籽和葵花籽

    及时收购蓖麻籽和葵花籽
    今年春天，广大城乡人民群众热烈响应国家号召，利用空闲土地广泛开展了种植蓖麻和向日葵的群众运动。种植的数量比以往任何一年都多。经过几个月来的精心管理和辛勤劳动，现在已经到了成熟季节。各地应当抓紧时机，立即掀起一个采摘、交售的热潮，把已经成熟的蓖麻籽和葵花籽采摘下来，踊跃卖给国家，支援国家建设。
    蓖麻和向日葵都是分散、零星种植的小油料，看起来不大显眼，但是我们切不可小看了它的作用。由于几年来各地广泛种植的结果，这些小油料已经日益成为我国油料作物的重要来源之一。这些小油料除了一少部分供食用外，在工业上用途很大。特别是蓖麻籽，它不仅可以供作制造农药、油漆、肥皂、印刷用油和医药原料之用，同时也是高级润滑油所不可缺少的原料。它们的经济价值是很高的。
    大跃进以来，工业部门对油脂的需要增长得很快，今年工业上的需要预计比去年还要有很大的增长。尽可能地把这些小油料及时收购起来，这对于促进工业生产的发展有着重大意义。同时，广大城乡群众把这些油料卖给国家，还可以增加一笔收入。因此，及时做好蓖麻籽和葵花籽的采摘和收购工作，不但可以进一步满足国家对油脂的需要，而且也是广大群众的要求。
    当前，不论采摘和交售，都要及时。作物早熟地区，应当边采摘、边交售。要做到成熟一片，收摘一片，成熟一株，收摘一株，一棵不漏，一粒不丢。收摘所以要强调及时，是因为蓖麻籽是分批开花、分批结果、分批成熟的作物，采摘及时就可以避免成熟的果实自动开裂、脱落而造成不应有的损失；交售得及时，就可以把这些小油料及早运入城市加工，投入市场，满足工业部门需要。而要做到收摘、交售及时，关键又在于做好劳动力的安排。各地应当在保证不影响农业生产对劳动力需要的原则下，合理调配劳动力，紧密结合中心工作，广泛动员社会力量，利用空隙时间，见缝插针，积极采摘。广大青少年要像种植的时候一样，继续成为采摘和交售的突击手，带头把蓖麻籽和葵花籽交售给国家。
    担负蓖麻籽和葵花籽收购工作的粮食部门和商业部门，应该努力做好收购工作。首先要根据这些小油料种植分散、零星的特点，采取多种多样的收购方法。在农村一方面要广设收购点和代购点，另一方面还应当组织力量串户上门收购。在城市要组织现有的粮食供应点大力收购。要不嫌零星，不怕麻烦，多少皆收，好次皆收，并且做到“按质论价，现金交易”，处处给群众以交售的便利。在收购中，各地必须认真贯彻执行集体种植的，收益归集体所有，个人种植的，收益归个人所有的收益分配政策，以鼓励广大群众交售的积极性。粮食和商业部门在做好收购工作的同时，还要做好留种工作，以便为明年继续扩大种植蓖麻和向日葵准备下足够的种籽。
