Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th - The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today, once again supporting the Lao people's struggle to break free from U.S. imperialist control and enslavement and to insist on taking the path of peace and neutrality.

The commentary said, "The U.S. State Department used to boast that the U.S. 'aid' had achieved the greatest success in Laos. Now everyone can clearly see that dollars cannot buy the Lao people's patriotism."

The commentary said, "Events in Laos over the past six years have proven that peace and neutrality are the only path that conforms to the interests of the Lao people and the interests of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia."

The commentary said, "In 1958, because the Lao government, with Prince Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister, fulfilled the Geneva Accords and pursued a policy of peace and neutrality, Laos gained peace, achieved national harmony, which was embodied in the establishment of a coalition government with the Lao Patriotic Forces participating, and established friendly relations with neighboring countries. However, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, the reactionary forces, undermined the neutrality that the Lao people had achieved through arduous struggle."

The commentary said that the Lao people and the patriotic forces in the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le overthrew the government of Chao Somsanith and established a government that decided to pursue a policy of peace and neutrality. This event opened up good prospects for the development of the situation in Laos.

The commentary quoted the support of Prime Minister Pham Van Dong and Premier Zhou Enlai in their recent speeches for the Lao people's struggle against U.S. imperialism. The commentary expressed its belief that "as long as the Lao people strengthen their unity and resolutely struggle, no imperialism and reactionary forces can hinder the Lao people's progress."

    越南“人民报”支持老挝人民的正义斗争
    和平中立符合老挝人民利益
    美元收买不了老挝人民的爱国心
    据新华社河内17日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论，再次支持老挝人民为摆脱美帝国主义控制、奴役和坚持要走和平中立的道路而进行的斗争。
    评论说，“美国国务院过去曾经夸耀美国的‘援助’在老挝取得最大的成功。现在大家都清楚地看到，美元收买不了老挝人民的爱国心。”
    评论说，“六年来在老挝发生的事件证明，和平中立是符合老挝人民的利益，符合印度支那和东南亚地区和平的利益的唯一道路。”
    评论说，“1958年，由于以富马亲王为首相的老挝政府履行日内瓦协议和奉行和平中立政策，老挝获得了安宁，实现了民族和睦，这种和睦体现在有寮国战斗部队参加的联合政府的成立以及同邻邦建立了友好的关系。但是，美帝国主义及其走狗反动势力破坏了老挝人民经过艰苦斗争才取得的中立。”
    评论说，老挝人民和以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会中的爱国力量推翻了昭·松萨尼特政府，并且成立了一个决定奉行和平中立政策的政府，这件事，为老挝局势的发展打开了良好的前景。
    评论引述了范文同总理、周恩来总理最近在讲话中对老挝人民反对美帝国主义斗争的支持，评论表示相信，“只要老挝人民加强团结，坚决斗争，任何帝国主义和反动势力都不能阻挠老挝人民的前进”。
