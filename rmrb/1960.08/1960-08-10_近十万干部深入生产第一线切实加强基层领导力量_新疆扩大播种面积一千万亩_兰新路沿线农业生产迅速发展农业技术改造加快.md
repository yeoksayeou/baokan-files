Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, August 9th. Under the unified leadership of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee, all sectors and industries have contracted to support the people's communes, guaranteeing support to the end, covering both production and life, and effectively strengthening the agricultural front. This year, the sown area in the region has expanded by ten million mu compared to last year. Summer crops have achieved an overall bumper harvest, and autumn field management is timely, with good growth.

This method of dividing areas for contracting, guaranteeing support to the end, started along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, and the experience gained was promoted throughout the region. At the beginning of this year, the Autonomous Region Party Committee, based on the new situation of Xinjiang's socialist construction after the construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, mobilized the autonomous region-level party and government, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, industry, transportation, and other systems to divide areas for contracting to support the production work of the people's communes in the seventeen counties and cities along the railway. The contracting tasks were to ensure the completion of production increase plans, assist in agricultural technology transformation, and do a good job in arranging people's lives; the contracting period was from spring planting to the end of the year. After the implementation of this contracting method, it had an immediate effect, and a brand-new situation quickly emerged in agricultural production and rural work in the railway line areas. In April, the Autonomous Region Party Committee immediately promoted this contracting method to the entire autonomous region. All prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and their subordinate counties and cities also mobilized forces from all sectors and industries to establish a responsibility system for contracting people's communes. Now, at the autonomous region, prefecture, and county levels, tens of thousands of cadres from all sectors and industries are stationed at the grassroots level for a long time, forming a "contracting network" in the vast agricultural and pastoral areas where every commune and team has dispatched cadres participating in and leading the work. This has greatly strengthened the leadership at the grassroots level and promoted rapid production development. In Turpan County, the five communes have more than 100 cadres dispatched by the autonomous region's party and government systems and county party committee departments for contracting, with several dispatched cadres participating in production leadership work in each production team. With the specific assistance of the dispatched cadres, the county reclaimed 110,000 mu of wasteland in the first half of the year, an increase of more than five times compared to the wasteland reclamation area in the same period last year, and the sown area of grain crops alone increased by about 60%.

Practice has proven that adopting this method has the following three major benefits: (1) Effectively strengthening the grassroots leadership in rural areas. Nearly 100,000 cadres at all levels (including cadres above the production brigade level) throughout the region have gone deep into the front lines of production, forming a "contracting network" in the vast agricultural and pastoral areas where every commune and team has dispatched cadres participating in and leading the work. This has greatly strengthened the leadership at the grassroots level and promoted rapid production development. (2) Further mobilizing the initiative and enthusiasm of all departments and industries to support agriculture. After all sectors and industries established a "contracting" relationship with the people's communes, they actively provided support in terms of manpower and materials. Non-agricultural systems such as the Autonomous Region's industry and transportation, finance and trade, culture and education, and military region transferred more than 1,000 cadres to eleven counties including Jimusar, Fukang, Miquan, and Hutubi, including more than 40 cadres such as ministers of the autonomous region party committee and directors of people's committee departments. The Autonomous Region's Department of Transportation, since the spring plowing, has been led by Han Guodong, deputy secretary of the party committee, with 28 cadres stationed in the 23 production teams of the Guoging Commune in Jimusar, helping the commune expand the cultivated land area by nearly doubled. When the commune lacked manpower during the summer harvest, the Department of Transportation immediately mobilized more than 300 cadres, 25 horse-drawn harvesters, and two cars to rush to support, speeding up the harvesting progress by half a month compared to previous years. (3) The vast number of cadres have further established a work style of sharing weal and woe with the masses and going deep and working practically. Cadre participation in labor has become a system. Not only do production team cadres work like the commune members, but the dispatched cadres from the commune, county, prefecture, and autonomous region have also generally achieved "three leads" (leading in labor, leading in enduring hardship, and taking the lead in tackling difficulties), which has been warmly praised by the masses. All of the region's more than 60,000 commune, management area, and production team cadres have joined the public canteens, working in the fields with the commune members during the day and eating at the same table with the commune members at night, fully integrating their lives with the masses. Because the cadres have been deeply involved in the grassroots level for a long time, they have a deeper understanding of the production situation, and their work is more practical and meticulous.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, August 9th. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China has adopted the method of dividing areas for contracting by various units at the autonomous region level to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production in the seventeen counties (cities) along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, achieving great success.

Strengthening the leadership of agricultural production along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is an effective measure taken by the Autonomous Region Party Committee to implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and accelerating the development of agricultural production. During the contracting period, leading cadres from various systems and departments led a group of cadres and technical personnel to go deep into the counties, communes, management areas, and production teams, serving as deputy leaders of these units and assisting local cadres in doing a good job in production; industrial departments helped the counties and communes enrich and establish farm tool factories in the form of factory-commune linkage, repair and manufacture various agricultural machinery, and train technical personnel. Since the beginning of spring planting, various units under the Autonomous Region and 80 large and small factories and mines have successively transferred more than 1,500 cadres and more than 400 technical workers to lead and help the vast number of commune members develop agricultural production, including leading cadres such as members of the Standing Committee of the Autonomous Region Party Committee and directors of departments and bureaus. Due to the adoption of this powerful measure, the sown area of various crops in the seventeen counties and cities along the railway this year has increased sharply by 37% compared to last year, especially the area of grain crops has increased even more, laying a reliable foundation for a bumper agricultural harvest throughout the year. At the same time, it has also accelerated the progress of agricultural technical transformation in these areas, and the area cultivated by machinery during spring planting and summer harvesting has further expanded. For example, in the first half of the year, the Urumqi Railway Bureau supported Toksun County with a batch of materials and equipment, and sent technicians to help the county repair cars, tractors, and various large agricultural tools, which increased the attendance rate of agricultural machinery in Toksun County by 31% compared to the original.

Currently, a very favorable agricultural situation has emerged in these areas. The actual harvested area of winter and spring wheat has expanded by more than 30% compared to last year, and the proportion of autumn field area has increased even more, and most of the crops are growing well. In order to ensure that the above-mentioned counties and cities not only win a bumper summer harvest but also manage the autumn fields well, at the beginning of the summer harvest, in addition to the cadres and technicians previously sent down still working with local cadres and the vast number of commune members in the fields, the autonomous region units also transferred more than 12,000 office cadres and nearly 100 technical and medical personnel to the counties and communes along the railway line with the most labor shortages to rush harvest summer grain and take care of autumn field management, greatly accelerating the summer harvest progress in various places and significantly improving the harvesting quality, many areas have achieved both summer harvest and autumn field management.

    近十万干部深入生产第一线切实加强基层领导力量
    新疆扩大播种面积一千万亩
    兰新路沿线农业生产迅速发展农业技术改造加快
    本报乌鲁木齐9日电　新疆维吾尔自治区在自治区党委统一领导下，各行各业包干支援人民公社，常年包到底，生产生活一齐包，切实加强了农业战线。今年全区播种面积比去年扩大一千万亩，夏季作物已获得全面丰收，秋田作物管理及时，生长良好。
    这种分片包干、一包到底的作法，是从兰新铁路沿线开始，取得经验推广到全区的。今年年初，自治区党委根据建筑兰新铁路后新疆社会主义建设事业发展的新形势，调动自治区一级党政、农林水利、工业交通等系统，分片包干支援铁路沿线的十七个县、市的人民公社的生产工作。包干任务是保增产计划的完成，协助农业技术改造，做好人民生活安排工作；包干时间，从春耕播种一直包到年底。这一包干办法推行后，立竿见影，铁路沿线地区农业生产和农村工作迅速出现了崭新的局面。4月间，自治区党委立即把这种包干办法推广到全自治区。各专区、自治州及其所属县市也调动各行各业力量，建立了包干人民公社的责任制。现在自治区、专区、县三级组织有几万名各行各业干部长期驻扎基层，有80％以上的厂矿企业同人民公社建立了长期支援农业技术改造的关系。
    实践证明，采取这种办法有以下三大好处：（一）切实加强了农村的基层领导力量。全区已有近十万名各级干部（包括生产大队以上干部）深入到生产第一线，在广大农牧区布成了一个社社、队队都有下派干部参加与领导工作的“包干网”。这就大大加强了基层领导力量，促进生产迅速发展。吐鲁番县五个公社有自治区党政系统和县委各部门下派包干的干部一百多名，每个生产队都有几名下派干部参加生产领导工作。在下派干部的具体帮助下，这个县上半年就开垦出十一万亩荒地，比去年同期开荒面积增加了五倍多，仅粮食作物播种面积就扩大了60％左右。
      （二）进一步调动了各部门各行业支援农业的主动性和积极性。各行各业同人民公社建立起“包干”关系后，都从人力、物力各方面给予主动支援。自治区工交、财贸、文教、军区等非农业系统一次就抽出一千多名干部下到吉木萨尔、阜康、米泉、呼图壁等十一个县，其中有区党委部长、人委厅局长等干部四十多名。自治区交通厅，从春耕起就由党委副书记韩国栋带领二十八名干部常驻吉木萨尔国庆公社的二十三个生产队，帮助公社把耕地面积扩大了将近一倍。公社夏收时人力不足，交通厅又立即动员三百多名干部、二十五部马拉收割机和两部汽车赶往支援，使收割进度比往年提前了半个月。
      （三）广大干部进一步树立起与群众共甘苦和深入踏实的工作作风。干部参加劳动已形成制度，不仅生产队干部和社员一样劳动，公社、县、专区和自治区的下派干部也普遍作到了“三带头”（劳动带头、吃苦带头、遇到困难带头去干），受到群众的热烈赞扬。全区六万多名公社、管理区和生产队的干部全部参加了公共食堂，白天和社员同田劳动，晚上和社员同桌吃饭，生活完全打成一片。干部由于长期深入基层，生产情况了解得更深入，工作也更踏实细致。
    新华社乌鲁木齐9日电　中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会采取自治区级各单位分片包干、一包到底的办法，加强兰新铁路沿线十七个县（市）农业生产的领导，取得了巨大成就。
    加强兰新铁路沿线农业生产的领导工作，是自治区党委贯彻以农业为基础、加速发展农业生产这一方针的有效措施。在包干期间，各系统各部门领导干部率领一批干部和技术人员，深入各县、社、管理区和生产队，担任这些单位的领导副职，协助当地干部搞好生产；工业部门以厂、社挂钩形式帮助各县和公社充实和建立农具厂，修理和制造各种农业机具，培训技术人材。从春播开始以来，自治区所属各单位和八十个大、小厂矿企业，陆续抽调了一千五百多名干部和四百多名技术工人，领导和帮助广大社员发展农业生产，其中包括自治区党委常委和厅、局长等领导干部等。由于采取了这一有力措施，今年铁路沿线十七个县、市各种作物的播种面积较去年猛增37％，特别是粮食作物的面积增加的幅度更大，为全年农业大丰收打下可靠的基础。同时，也加速了这些地区农业技术改造的进度，春播和夏收期间机具耕作的面积进一步扩大。如乌鲁木齐铁路局上半年支援托克逊县一批物资和器材，并派出技术员帮助该县修理汽车、拖拉机和各种大型农具，使托克逊县农机具出勤率较原先提高了31％。
  目前，这些地区出现了一片农业大好形势。冬、春小麦实收面积比去年扩大了30％多，秋田面积增加的比例更大，而且绝大部分作物生长良好。为了确保以上县、市在夺取夏季大丰收的同时管好秋田，夏收开始时，自治区各单位，除以往派下去的干部和技术工人仍和当地干部以及广大社员深入田间以外，又抽调了一万二千多名机关干部和近百名技术、医务人员，分赴铁路沿线劳动力最缺乏的县、社，抢收夏粮，兼顾秋田管理，使各地的夏收进度大大加快，收割质量显著提高，许多地区作到了夏收秋田管理两不误。
