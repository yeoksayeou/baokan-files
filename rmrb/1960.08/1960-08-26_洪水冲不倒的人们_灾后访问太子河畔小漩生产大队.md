    People the Flood Couldn't Wash Away
    —A Post-Disaster Visit to Xiaoxuan Production Brigade on the Banks of the Taizi River
    Xinhua News Agency reporters Miao Yu and Yang Shaoshan

    Shortly after the ferocious floodwaters of the Taizi River receded, we visited the Xiaoxuan Production Brigade of Anping People's Commune in Liaoyang City, Liaoning Province. This brigade is situated on the banks of the Taizi River, and this flood swallowed about half of the village. A large area of fertile farmland and crops on the river滩 were swept away by the flood.

    We started from the west end of the village, near the Taizi River. Some houses on both sides had been washed down by the flood, and the front and back walls of many houses had been soaked through by the water. Now, commune members are busy rebuilding their homes. The newly built walls are not yet dry, and piles of silt dug out from the houses are piled up at the door. As soon as we entered the village, commune members asked, "How did you get here? Is the train running yet?" Then they told us the story of how they united to fight the flood.

    This is a communized village that the flood could not wash away.

    On the evening of August 3rd, it was raining heavily, and the Taizi River was rising rapidly. The Commune Party Committee was constantly issuing heavy rain warnings and flood control instructions over the phone. That night, the Xiaoxuan Production Brigade Party Branch, with the help of comrades from the Municipal Party Committee and Commune Party Committee work team, held a meeting overnight to study flood prevention and rescue work. At the meeting, the branch committee members divided up the work: production team leader Wu Anmin was in charge of guarding the riverside and the village entrance, paying special attention to the safety of the brigade's grain; deputy team leader Cao Enfang was in charge of guarding the brigade's pig farm at the foot of the mountain, preventing mountain floods; branch secretary Dong Diangui stayed at the team headquarters to contact higher authorities and direct the overall situation. Wu Shenglin, the leader of the first team, proposed to immediately notify the village militia and commune members, and use the ringing of the bell as a signal in an emergency, so that everyone would come out immediately to fight the flood and carry out rescue work as soon as they heard the bell.

    That night, branch secretary Dong Diangui, team leader Wu Anmin, and many other cadres did not sleep all night, directing and deploying flood control work. At twelve o'clock in the middle of the night, the phone line connecting with the commune was cut off by the flood. The roar of the Taizi River flood was getting louder and louder. At about four o'clock in the morning, the river water was swollen, and the waves were as high as houses, and a large area of grain, vegetable fields, and land along the river had already been submerged. Seeing this situation, Dong Diangui and the others immediately ran back to the team headquarters and rang the bell. The ringing of the bell alarmed everyone in the village. The militiamen, who had been prepared for a long time, drove carts, carried sacks, and more than a hundred people rushed to the west end of the village. Workers from nearby basic construction sites also came to support them with carts.

    At first, the cadres led the militia to rescue only the families at the westernmost end. Seeing that the river was rising too fast, the cadres immediately led some of the commune members to the granary to rescue the grain. Some people were digging, some were loading, some were carrying, and some were transporting. By the time the wheat and potatoes were moved away, the water had already entered the warehouse. At the same time, the brigade's breeders also drove more than seventy cattle, forty mules, horses, and donkeys, and more than one hundred and forty sheep to the mountains.

    Regardless of whether they were from the west or east of the village, people bravely rescued in the rising floodwaters. With many people and great strength, and with everyone united well, they finally rescued the quilts, bedding, and clothing from the homes of more than thirty commune members at the west end of the village.

    At that time, the cadres who were directing the rescue work could not take care of their own homes. Branch secretary Dong Diangui's home was next to the warehouse, and the flood passed his house, but he still only cared about rescuing the grain. He said: This is the lifeline of all the commune members, and it cannot be lost in the slightest. Team leader Wu Anmin was busy rescuing other people's homes when he heard that his own home had also been flooded. Wu Anmin said, "It's important to rescue everyone else's things first." The commune members were very moved to see the cadres sacrificing themselves for others. The things in the cadres' homes were also rescued with the help of the masses.

    The flood had already flooded more than half of the village street. At this time, the Party Branch held another emergency meeting to arrange the residences of the affected commune members and quickly built more than twenty thatched sheds on the mountain in case the flood rose again. It wasn't until after three o'clock in the afternoon that the rising river water began to stabilize.

    The river water rose quickly and receded quickly. In less than a day and night, the river滩 was exposed. When the commune members ran to the west end, they saw that the land on the riverbank, along with the soil, crops, and manure accumulated over the year, had been washed away, and the ditches had been filled in, exposing piles of sand and gravel.

    The Party Branch immediately held an expanded meeting of the branch committee and, together with the comrades from the work team, arranged for the living problems of the commune members after the disaster. Wu Shenglin, the leader of the first team in the east, which was not affected by the disaster, proposed that the entire brigade first help the affected commune members build houses. He said, "The disaster of the second team in the west is the disaster of the entire brigade. We can't ignore the fact that their houses have been washed down." He guaranteed that if the second team couldn't repair their houses, the first team would take care of it all. The meeting also decided that the brigade would also record work points for the affected commune members who built their own houses, so as not to make them fall behind in the autumn harvest distribution. These decisions were announced at a mass meeting, and the commune members generally agreed, and the affected households were relieved.

    As soon as the flood subsided a little, the Commune Party Committee sent cadres who carried many things on their backs, including candles, clothes, shoes, etc., and waded through the water to express their condolences. The Commune Party Committee assigned the task of restoring production and rebuilding their homes after the disaster to the brigade. According to the commune's arrangements, the brigade planted autumn vegetables on the one hand, strengthened field management on the other hand, and sent thirty-six laborers to help the affected commune members repair and build houses. After the poor peasant commune member Wu Shengyu's house was soaked by the flood, the mud-filled partition walls collapsed. Now the team sent people to help him build new partition walls and a stove with stones. He happily said, "My house is stronger than before. Now that the Communist Party and the People's Commune care about us, in the past, let alone a collapsed house, no one would care even if people died." The old people in the village recalled: This flood is truly unprecedented. The flood that occurred in the fourteenth year of the Guangxu reign was the largest, but it only flooded the Dragon King Temple at the westernmost end. If it hadn't been for the leadership of the Party, the commune as a backing, and the good leadership of the cadres, and the strong unity of everyone, no one knows how many families would have been bankrupted.

    What made the commune members most satisfied this time was the public canteen. Because the brigade's grain was rescued well, not a single grain was lost. During the flood and after the disaster, the public canteen of the entire brigade guaranteed the commune members' lives very well, and there was no change. After the disaster, the branch secretary went to the canteen three or four times a day. The commune members all said that the canteen is truly an unbreakable iron rice bowl.

    After this flood test, the commune members loved their People's Commune even more, felt the Party's meticulous care even more, and saw the strength of their unity even more. The commune members also told us about the province sending planes to airdrop relief supplies to the disaster area. As soon as the flood subsided, the Provincial Party Committee and the Municipal Party Committee sent condolence teams. The house of poor peasant commune member Lan Xilu was washed down by the flood, and he was immediately settled after the disaster. He was so moved that he kept saying, "This country is too good, this country is too good!"

    After the disaster, the Xiaoxuan Brigade had even greater enthusiasm for production. They were determined to strive for more grain from the unaffected farmland and reduce the losses from the disaster. Now, in this village, as soon as dawn breaks, some people are planting vegetables in the fields, some are thinning seedlings, and some are topping cotton. If it rains and they can't go to the fields, they collect manure at home. The commune members joked, "In the past, the manure was scattered in the yards, but this time it was washed into the streets, making it more convenient for us to collect manure." The crops in Xiaoxuan Brigade that were not affected by the disaster are growing very well, with no weeds in sight, the corn cobs are long and large, the sorghum ears are neat and tidy, and each cotton plant has already set five or six peaches. When we left this village, the task of planting autumn vegetables assigned by the commune had been completed, and even the ends of the fields and the brains had been planted; manure accumulation and field management were in full swing.

    洪水冲不倒的人们
    ——灾后访问太子河畔小漩生产大队
    新华社记者　缪雨　杨绍山
    凶猛的太子河洪水刚退，我们访问了辽宁省辽阳市安平人民公社的小漩生产大队。这个大队处于太子河岸上，这次洪水把村子吞噬了大约一半。河滩一大片肥沃的农田和庄稼被洪水扫荡无余。
    我们从靠近太子河的村西头上去。两旁有的房子被洪水冲倒了，许多房子前后墙被水泡穿。现在，社员们正在忙着重整家园。新砌的墙土还没有干，门口堆着从房里刨出来的淤泥。一进村子，社员们就问：“你们怎样来的？火车都通了吗？”接着就讲起他们怎样团结一致同洪水作斗争的故事。
    这是一个公社化了的洪水冲不倒的村庄。
    8月3日晚上，大雨滂沱，太子河洪水猛涨。公社党委不断从电话里发出暴雨警报和抗洪的指示。那天晚上，小漩生产大队党支部，在市委、公社党委工作组同志的帮助下，连夜开会研究防洪抢险的事。会上，支部委员们分了工：由生产队长吴安敏警戒河边村头，特别注意大队粮食的安全；副队长曹恩芳看守山脚下大队养猪场，防止山洪暴发；支部书记董殿贵留在队部同上级联系，指挥全面。第一小队队长吴生良提议马上通知村里民兵和社员，在情况紧急的时候以打钟为令，一听到钟声立即出来抗洪抢险。
    这一夜，支部书记董殿贵、队长吴安敏和很多干部一夜没有睡觉，指挥部署抗洪的事。到半夜十二点钟，洪水就把同公社联系的电话冲断了。太子河洪水的嚎叫声越来越大。到了早晨四点钟左右，只见河水涨得鼓鼓的，浪头翻起来有房子高，早把河边一大片粮谷菜地淹没了。来势汹汹的洪水很快就要从西头进村子。一看这个情况，董殿贵他们立即跑回队部敲钟。当当的钟声，惊动了全村的人。早就作好准备的民兵们，架大车的架大车，拿麻袋的拿麻袋，一百多人一涌赶到了村西头。附近基本建设工地的工人们也赶来大车支援。
    起初，干部率领民兵只顾抢救最西头的几家，一看河水涨得太猛，干部们立即带领一部分社员奔到粮仓抢救粮食。扒的扒，装的装，背的背，运的运，等到把麦子、土豆一搬走，水已经进到仓里。同时，大队饲养员也把七十多头牛，四十多头骡马驴子，一百四十多只羊都赶到了山上。
    不分村西村东，在越涨越高的洪水里，人们奋勇地抢救着。人多力量大，大家团结得好，终于把村西头三十多户社员家里连铺的、盖的、穿的都抢救出来了。
    当时干部们指挥抢救工作，都顾不了自己的家。支部书记董殿贵的家就在仓库旁边，洪水过了他的家，但他还是只顾抢救粮食。他说：这是全村社员的命根子，不能让它有丝毫损失。队长吴安敏正在忙着抢救别家的时候，听到家里也进水了。吴安敏说：“先把大伙的东西抢出来要紧。”社员们看到干部这样舍己为人，都很感动。干部们家里的东西也都给群众帮助抢出来了。
    洪水已经涨过全村大半条街。这时候党支部又召开了一次紧急会议，把受灾社员的住处一一安排妥当，同时到山上很快搭了二十多间席棚，防备洪水再涨。一直到下午三点多钟，暴涨的河水才开始安稳下来。
    这河水涨得快，消得也快，不到一昼夜，河滩就显露出来了。社员们跑到西头一看，河岸上的地，连地皮带庄稼和积了一年的粪，都给冲跑了，河沟也被填满，露出砂石累累。
    党支部立即召开支委扩大会，和工作组同志一起安排灾后社员的生活问题。东头没有受灾的第一小队队长吴生良提出全大队首先帮助受灾社员盖房子。他说：“西头二小队受灾就是全大队的灾，他们房子冲倒了不能不管。”他保证二小队房子修不过来的，一小队都包下来。会上还决定，受灾社员盖自己家房子，大队也给记工分，免得他们秋收分配撵不上。这些决定在群众大会上一宣布，社员普遍赞成，受灾户都安心了。
    洪水稍一消退，公社党委就派来了干部，背来很多东西，有蜡烛、衣被、鞋子等等，涉水前来慰问。公社党委向大队布置了灾后恢复生产、重建家园的工作。根据公社的安排，大队一面抢种秋菜，加强田间管理，一面派出三十六个劳动力帮助受灾社员修盖房屋。贫农社员吴生余的房子被洪水泡过后，用泥巴堆的间壁都倒塌了，现在队里派人用石头帮他修了新的间壁、锅台。他高兴地说：“我这房子比过去更结实了。现在有共产党和人民公社关心我们，要是在过去，不要说是倒了房，连死人都没人管。”村里老人们回忆：这大水真是空前的。光绪十四年发的洪水是最大的了，也只淹到尽西头的龙王庙。这次洪水要不是有了党的领导，公社作靠山，和干部当家领导得好，大伙团结心强，真不知有多少人家要倾家荡产。
    这次使社员们最满意的是公共食堂。因为大队粮食抢救得好，一颗没有损失。洪水进村和灾后，全大队的公共食堂对社员们的生活都保证得很好，没有什么变化。灾后，支部书记一天要到食堂看三、四回。社员们都说，食堂真是打不破的铁饭碗。
    经过这次洪水考验，社员们更加热爱自己的人民公社，更加感到了党的无微不至的关怀，更加看到了自己团结的力量。社员们还告诉我们省里派飞机给灾区空投救灾物资的事。洪水一消退，省委、市委又派来了慰问队。贫农社员蓝锡禄房子被洪水冲倒了，灾后立刻得到了安顿，感动得他一个劲儿念叨：“这个国家太好了，这个国家太好了！”
    灾后，小漩大队生产劲头更大，他们决心争取没有受灾的农田多打粮食，减少受灾的损失。现在，在这个村子里，天刚亮，只见下地种菜的种菜，间苗的间苗，给棉花打尖的打尖；遇雨不能下地，就在家里起粪。社员们打趣地说：“以前粪都分散在院子里，这一冲都冲到街上来了，我们起粪更方便了。”小漩大队没有受灾的庄稼都长得很好，不见荒草，玉米棒子又长又大，高粱穗子齐齐整整，棉花每株已经座桃五、六个。当我们离开这个村子的时候，公社布置的抢种秋菜任务已经完成，连地头地脑都种上了；积肥和田间管理正闹得热气腾腾。
