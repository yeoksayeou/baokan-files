Sichuan, Fujian, Guangxi, and Gaozhou County, Guangdong and other rosin producing areas seize the opportunity to collect more pine resin.

(This report) Our newspaper reports that Sichuan's commercial departments, under the slogan of "increasing production without increasing manpower," are seizing the opportunity to carry out the collection and purchase of pine resin. This year, the number of people in the province going up the mountains to collect resin has been reduced by half compared to last year. However, due to strengthened organization and leadership and the innovation of collection techniques, production has increased by about one-quarter compared to the same period last year.

In order to implement the policy of "taking grain as the key link," commercial departments in various regions, under the principle of "strengthening the front line of agricultural production," rationally arrange manpower to go up the mountains. The commercial department of Nanchuan County, under the unified arrangement of the Party Committee, adopted the method of combining specialized work with mass blitzes, doing small-scale work during busy farming seasons and large-scale work and major blitzes during slack seasons, staggering the busy farming seasons. Therefore, although the number of people going up the mountains to collect pine resin in the county this year is less than half of last year, the output has increased more than five times compared to the same period last year.

Commercial departments also regard actively improving collection tools and innovating collection techniques as a powerful measure to save labor and improve work efficiency. For example, the commercial department of Nanjiang County assisted the communes in creating and promoting seventeen kinds of medicinal resin collection methods, innovating seven kinds of resin collection tools such as resin cutting knives, resin collection devices, and scrapers, and organized more than 150 new-style resin collection technology demonstration meetings in forest areas, increasing resin collection efficiency by one to three times.

(This report) Fujian's rosin producing areas are vigorously grasping rosin production, continuously improving rosin output and quality. Up to now, the province's rosin production has increased by 1.43 times compared to the same period last year, of which more than 95% are first-class and special-grade products.

Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, rosin production in various regions this year has broken the old routine of going up the mountains around Qingming Festival and coming down around Frost's Descent, changing seasonal production to year-round production. In resin collection and refining, various regions have widely promoted the experience of chemical resin collection in Chong'an County, making the resin yield of pine trees generally 60% to two times higher than last year. After adopting the new Chong'an chemical resin collection method, the resin collection workers in Yongtai County increased the average resin yield of pine trees by two to three times compared to the original, with the highest reaching more than five times. Due to the increased resin yield of pine trees, the resin collection rate has also generally increased. In the past, a worker could only collect six catties of resin per day, but now using chemical resin collection, they generally reach about eighteen catties, with the highest being able to collect more than thirty catties of pine resin per day, thus making the county's rosin production this year not weak in the off-season, increasing by more than double compared to the same period last year.

(This report) Guangxi is seizing the current peak season for pine resin production and actively carrying out pine resin procurement work. By the end of July, the amount of pine resin purchased throughout the region had increased by about 60% compared to the same period last year.

In the procurement of pine resin, commercial departments in various regions dispatched a large number of technical personnel and cadres to participate in production, organize production, and provide technical guidance, thus making pine resin production rise steadily. Langping Commune in Bobai County promoted the method of mixing salt water and Polygonum hydropiper water for resin collection, increasing the amount of resin collected per person per day from the original twenty catties to thirty-three to thirty-seven catties. Resin collection personnel in Baigui Brigade of Cenxi County changed single-row resin collection to double-row resin collection and changed less cutting to more cutting, greatly increasing output, with the average daily output per person increasing from the past ten catties to fifteen to twenty catties, and some reaching more than forty catties per day.

(This report) Gaozhou County, one of the key rosin producing areas in Guangdong Province, has grasped rosin production early, tightly, and accurately this year. By July 14th, it had produced 1,372 tons of rosin, an increase of more than ten times compared to the same period last year.

This year, the first secretaries of the Party committees of the twenty-six communes in the county with rosin production tasks have taken the lead in rosin production. The communes in the eleven key producing areas have also established rosin production command posts, strengthening leadership at all levels. On the basis of the mass movement to collect resin in winter last year, the county has fixed more than 3,000 resin collection personnel this year, forming professional resin collection teams, and established forty resin collection yards. The establishment of professional teams and resin collection yards has transformed the past individual and decentralized production into specialized and factory production, thus greatly increasing production efficiency.

### 四川、福建、广西和广东高州县等松香产区  抓紧时机多采松脂

    四川、福建、广西和广东高州县等松香产区
    抓紧时机多采松脂
    本报讯　四川商业部门在增产不增人的口号下，抓紧时机开展松脂的采割收购工作。今年，全省上山采脂的人数比去年减少一半，但由于加强组织领导，革新采割技术，产量却比去年同期增长四分之一左右。
    为了贯彻执行“以粮为纲”的方针，各地商业部门在“加强农业生产第一线”的原则下，合理安排劳力上山。南川县商业部门在党委统一安排下，采取专业与群众突击相结合，农忙小搞，农闲大搞、大突击的办法，错开了农忙季节。因此，今年全县上山采割松脂的人数虽然不到去年的一半，但产量比去年同期提高五倍以上。
    商业部门还把积极改进采割工具，革新采割技术，作为节省劳力提高工效的一项有力措施。如南江县商业部门协助公社创造推广十七种药剂采脂法，革新割脂刀、收脂器、刮刀等七种采脂工具，并以林区为单位组织了一百五十多次新式采脂技术表演会，使采脂工效提高一至三倍。
    本报讯　福建各松香产区大抓狠抓松香生产，使松香产量、质量不断提高。到目前为止，全省已生产的松香比去年同期增长了一点四三倍，其中95％以上是一级品和特级品。
    各地在各级党委领导下，今年松香生产都打破了往年清明上山，霜降下山的老常规，变季节性生产为常年生产。在采脂、炼制中，各地普遍推广了崇安县化学采脂的经验，使松树出脂率普遍比去年提高60％到二倍以上。永泰县采脂工人采用崇安化学采脂新方法后，平均松树出脂率比原来提高两、三倍，最高的达五倍以上。由于松树出脂率提高，采脂率也普遍提高。去年一个劳力每天只能采脂六斤，现在采用化学采脂，一般都达到十八斤左右，最高的每天能采松脂三十多斤，因而使全县今年松香生产作到淡季不淡，比去年同期增长了一倍多。
    本报讯　广西各地抓住当前松脂生产旺季，积极开展松脂采购工作。到7月底止，全区已收购的松脂比去年同期增长60％左右。
    在松脂采购中，各地商业部门派出大批技术人员和干部，参加生产，组织生产，进行技术指导，因而使松脂生产节节上升。博白县浪平公社推广盐水和辣蓼水混合采脂法，每天每人采脂由原来二十斤提高到三十三至三十七斤；岑溪县白?大队采脂人员改单行采脂为双行采脂，改少割为多割，使产量大增，平均每人日产由过去的十斤增加到十五至二十斤，有的日产达四十斤以上。
    本报讯　广东省松香生产重点产区之一——高州县，今年松香生产抓得早、抓得紧、抓得准，到7月14日，已生产松香一千三百七十二吨，比去年同期增长十倍以上。
    今年这个县的二十六个有松香生产任务的公社，都由党委第一书记挂帅搞松香生产。十一个重点产区的公社还成立了松香生产指挥部，层层加强领导。在去年大闹冬季采脂群众运动的基础上，今年这个县把三千多名采脂人员固定下来，组成采脂专业队，并建立了四十个采脂场。专业队和采脂场的建立，把过去个体、分散生产变为专业化和工厂化，因而生产效率大大提高。
