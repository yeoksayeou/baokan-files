    At the junction of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region's eastern edge of the Ordos Plateau desert and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Otog Banner—on the shores of Da Chu Lake—a "Unity Sand-Fixing Forest Farm" has been established. This forest farm is jointly run by the Ciyaobao Commune of Lingwu County (a Hui people's settlement) and Yuzhuangzi Commune of Yanchi County (an old revolutionary base area inhabited by Han people) in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and the Bulage Commune of Otog Banner (a Mongolian settlement) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    At the junction of these three communes was originally a vast, boundless desert, stretching for over a hundred *li* from west to east. Whenever strong winds arose, the sky would darken, and the desert would move towards the surrounding farmland and grasslands like an irresistible, overwhelming flood, severely threatening the production and lives of the nearby Hui, Mongolian, and Han people. Before liberation, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, governing the desert was unthinkable, let alone actually doing anything about it. After liberation, under the brilliant light of the Party's nationalities policy, the Hui, Mongolian, and Han people united and adopted many methods to combat the desert, but because the mutual aid teams and cooperatives at the time were weak and did not have the strength to fundamentally govern it, the desert still brought many difficulties to the development of agricultural and pastoral production.
    After the people's communes were established in 1958, the ideal of the Hui, Mongolian, and Han commune members to fundamentally control the desert for many years finally became a reality. Under the leadership of the Party, they fully utilized the superiority of the people's communes, opened up the boundaries of the autonomous regions, and fraternal nationalities united as one, beginning to establish the "Unity Sand-Fixing Forest Farm" on the shores of Da Chu Lake.
    Today, commune members of the three nationalities are jointly reclaiming the virgin land around Da Chu Lake that has been dormant for many years, sowing for the first time the seeds of tree species and other crops to fundamentally eradicate the desert. Moreover, they are also seizing the opportunity of the post-rain soil moisture to scatter large quantities of wild grass seeds in the sand pits, allowing them to germinate and grow in a timely manner. At the same time, the afforestation project is also progressing rapidly with the concerted efforts of the fraternal nationalities' commune members. They plan to complete the task of cultivating two hundred and fifty *mu* of seedlings this year, to plant more than two thousand eight hundred *mu* of sand-fixing forests and *sha hao* (Artemisia wendelboi), and to build two sandbreak forest belts, one hundred and forty *li* long and more than one hundred meters wide, to completely eradicate the desert disaster; they also plan to plant millet, sorghum, potatoes, and other crops around the forest farm to green and beautify this desert area by Da Chu Lake, making the mountains and rivers of the motherland even more beautiful. This great plan to fundamentally eradicate the desert has further encouraged the confidence of the three nationalities' commune members to conquer nature. They are determined, under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of Chairman Mao's great nationalities policy, to transform this desert into a good place for producing grain, timber, and fruit.

    宁夏内蒙古交界处闪耀党的民族政策光辉
    兄弟民族团结一心根治沙漠
    本报讯　在宁夏回族自治区东部鄂尔多斯台地沙漠边沿与内蒙古自治区鄂托克旗交界的地方——大处湖畔，办起了一处“团结固沙林场”。这个林场是宁夏回族自治区回族聚居的灵武县磁窑堡公社、汉族聚居的老革命根据地盐池县余庄子公社，和内蒙古自治区蒙族聚居的鄂托克旗布拉格公社共同兴办的林场。
    这三个公社的交界处，原来有一片茫茫无垠的大沙漠，从西到东蜿蜒一百多华里。每当刮起大风来，这里天昏地暗，沙漠就像不可抗拒的滔天洪水，向周围农田和草原移动着，严重地威胁着附近回、蒙、汉族人民的生产和生活。解放前，在国民党反动派统治下，甭说治理，连想也不敢想；解放后，回、蒙、汉族人民在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，团结起来采用了许多办法治沙漠，但由于当时的互助组和合作社人力单薄，没有力量从根本上治理，沙漠仍给农牧业生产的发展带来了很多的困难。
    1958年人民公社化后，使这里的回、蒙、汉族社员多年根治沙漠的理想，终于变成了现实。他们在党的领导下，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，打开自治区界线，兄弟民族团结一心，开始在大处湖畔建立“团结固沙林场”。
    如今，三个民族的社员共同开垦着大处湖周围沉睡多年的处女地，第一次播下了根治沙漠的树种和其它作物种子。并且，他们还把大量的野草籽趁着雨后的墒期撒在沙窝里，叫它及时发芽生长。与此同时，造林工程在兄弟民族社员的齐心努力下，也在迅速进展。他们计划在今年内完成二百五十亩的育苗任务，要种植二千八百多亩固沙林和沙蒿，营造长达一百四十华里、宽百余米的两条防沙林带，彻底根治沙漠灾害；还准备在林场周围种植糜、谷、洋芋等作物，绿化和美化大处湖边的这块沙漠，让祖国的山河更加美丽。这个伟大的根治沙漠的计划，更加鼓舞了三个民族社员征服自然的信心。他们决心在党的领导下，在毛主席伟大的民族政策的光辉照耀下，把这块沙漠改造成为一个生产粮食、木材、水果的好地方。
