    Soliciting Opinions from Commune Members
    Cheng Ying, a member of the Party branch of the Gaoyang County Power Machinery Factory in Hebei Province, recently went deep into the countryside with the factory's technical workers to solicit commune members' opinions on the diesel engines produced by the factory and to discuss with them how to improve product quality. This method is very good and can make the products more suitable for agricultural needs. For example, recently they heard that commune members of the Miao Jiaying Production Team of the Liushi Commune complained about the insufficient horsepower of the 12-horsepower diesel engine. After Cheng Ying and the workers checked, it turned out that the cylinder was leaking air. Another example is that the commune members of the Nan Guodan Production Team of the Baichi Commune reported that the diesel engine was difficult to start. After several inspections, it was found that the oil nozzle pressure was too high. After the factory comrades returned to the factory, they repeatedly studied and improved the cylinder casting method, adopting centrifugal casting, and reduced the oil nozzle pressure from 200 kilograms to 150 kilograms, which improved the efficiency of the diesel engine and also reduced fuel consumption. In the past three months, due to humbly listening to the opinions of commune members, the more than 230 diesel engines produced by this factory have been welcomed by commune members.

    征求社员的意见
    河北省高阳县动力机械厂党支部委员程英同志最近和工厂技术工人深入农村，征求社员对工厂生产的柴油机的意见，并和社员商量如何改进产品的质量。这个办法很好，可以使产品更加适合农业的需要。像最近他们听到留史公社缪家营生产队社员提出十二马力柴油机的马力不足，经程英和工人们检查，原来是汽缸跑汽。又如百尺公社南郭丹生产队社员提出柴油机不好开车，经过多次检查，发现是因为油嘴压力高。工厂同志回厂后，反复研究，改进了汽缸铸造方法，采用了离心浇铸，油嘴压力由二百公斤降低到一百五十公斤，提高了柴油机的效能，还减少了油耗。最近三个月来，这个工厂由于虚心听取社员的意见，所以生产的二百三十多台柴油机，都受到了社员的欢迎。
