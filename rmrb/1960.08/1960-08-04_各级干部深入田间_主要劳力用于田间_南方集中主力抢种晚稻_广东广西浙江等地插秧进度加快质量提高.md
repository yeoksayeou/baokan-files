Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd: Guangdong's early rice harvest has basically ended, and all localities are fully transitioning to the busy season of late rice transplanting, striving to complete the summer planting tasks according to the season, acreage, and quality. As of July 27th, the province had harvested 81% of its early rice and transplanted over 15.34 million mu of late rice.

All localities regard early transplanting as the primary link to ensure a bumper harvest of late rice. Party committees have adopted the method of concentrating leadership, labor, funds, materials, and departmental forces to seize every minute and second and accelerate the progress of transplanting. Recently, Jiangmen, Foshan, Shantou, Shaoguan Prefectures, and Hainan Island have transferred one million laborers from state-owned factories, commune-run enterprises, and various professional teams and logistics departments of the brigades to strengthen the summer planting front, bringing the number of people engaged in late rice transplanting in the province to 4.3 million, and the progress of transplanting is accelerating day by day. Hainan Island, where the season is earlier, had transplanted 76% of the planned area of late rice as of July 27th, and many counties on the island have transitioned to field management. Some areas of Shaoguan Prefecture have been suffering from prolonged drought, which has affected late rice transplanting. These areas have quickly organized the masses to block rivers and divert water for irrigation, implementing drought resistance and rush planting. More than 700,000 mu of drought-stricken rice fields in Shantou Prefecture have been relieved of drought after the masses worked day and night to pump water for irrigation.

In the rush to transplant, all localities conscientiously implement advanced technical measures centered on rational close planting to ensure that late rice transplanting reaches high standards and high quality. Since mid-July, Shantou Prefecture has dispatched more than 600,000 people every day to engage in fertilizer accumulation and production. Recently, the entire area has sent 1 billion dan of fertilizer to the fields. In addition, all localities vigorously promote the practice of returning rice straw to the fields. The area where rice straw has been returned to the fields in Jiangmen, Shaoguan, and other prefectures alone has reached more than 5 million mu. The late rice that has already been transplanted in the province generally meets the requirements of close planting.

All localities in the province are trying every possible means to expand the planting area of late rice and miscellaneous grains. From the beginning of June to the end of July, the province has planted 9.6 million mu of miscellaneous grains, which is three times that of the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 3rd: The people's communes in rural Guangxi are racing against time and seizing the season to strive to complete the task of late rice transplanting with guaranteed quality and quantity around the beginning of autumn.

As of the 29th, the entire autonomous region had planted more than 3.5 million mu of late rice. In order to complete the transplanting of all late rice before and after the beginning of autumn without missing the season, party committees at all levels have further concentrated labor and strengthened the "double rush" front. At present, the labor force投入 into field production in the entire region has surged from 3.77 million on July 19th to more than 5 million at present. Because Bobai County concentrated 80% of its labor force, although the late rice area was expanded by 90,000 mu compared with early rice, the late rice planted by July 25th accounted for 72% of the planting plan. In the rush to transplant, all localities paid close attention to the specifications and quality of planting.

All localities are doing everything possible to carry out high-efficiency movements to accelerate the work of rushing to harvest and rushing to plant. The number of rice transplanters made in the entire region has increased by about one time compared with the spring planting, and most of them are now投入 into the rush transplanting. 68% of Ningming County's 360,000 mu of late rice is transplanted with rice transplanters. By the end of July, the task of rushing to plant had been fully completed, more than ten days earlier than the same period last year.

In the rush to plant late rice, more than 60,000 cadres in the entire region went deep into the front line of agricultural production to participate in production and lead production. They paid special attention to the leadership of backward teams. The thirteen county party secretaries and members of Baise County who went to the countryside and the twenty-one commune party secretaries of the entire county settled in the backward teams, prompting the twenty-three brigades in the entire county that were slower in rushing to harvest and rushing to plant to catch up with the advanced teams, thus accelerating the rushing to harvest and rushing to plant in the entire county by more than one time compared with the initial stage. Ningming County, which rushed to transplant quickly, also dispatched more than 300 laborers in mid-July, carrying 150 rice transplanters, to Shangsi County, which is adjacent to it, to help rush to transplant.

Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 3rd: All parts of Zhejiang Province warmly responded to the provincial party committee's call to "fight hard for ten days to win a complete victory in the summer harvest and summer planting." Party committees at all levels took effective measures, fully mobilized the masses, concentrated all available labor, and focused on late rice transplanting centered on "five guarantees" (guarantee acreage, guarantee season, guarantee close planting, guarantee base fertilizer, guarantee deep plowing), striving for late rice to surpass early rice.

The planting area of ​​early and late rice in Zhejiang Province this year is larger than last year, and the harvesting and planting area accounts for more than 60% of the total grain sowing area for the whole year. Successfully completing the summer harvest and summer planting tasks is the key to achieving a continuous leap forward in grain production this year. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels went to the areas with the most arduous tasks to lead the summer harvest and summer planting. Jiaxing Prefecture has concentrated 87% of its labor force on the harvest and planting front, which has accelerated the progress and ensured the quality. The daily planting progress has increased by about one time compared with the same period last year. As of July 28th, the early rice harvested in the province accounted for more than 60% of the area that should be harvested, and the continuous cropping of late rice that has been transplanted reached 32.9% of the planned area.

    各级干部深入田间　主要劳力用于田间
    南方集中主力抢种晚稻
    广东广西浙江等地插秧进度加快质量提高
    据新华社广州3日电　广东早稻收割已基本结束，各地全力转上晚稻插秧大忙，力争按季节按面积按质量完成夏种任务。到7月27日止，全省已收割早稻81％，插下晚稻一千五百三十四万多亩。
    各地都把早插做为保证晚稻丰收的首要一环，党委采取领导、劳力、资金、物资、部门力量集中使用的办法，争分夺秒，加快插秧进度。最近，江门、佛山、汕头、韶关专区和海南岛等地已从国营厂矿、社办企业和大队的各种专业队、后勤部门抽调出一百万劳动力，增强夏种战线，使全省投入晚造插秧的人数达到四百三十万，插秧进度日益加快。季节较早的海南岛，到7月27日止，全岛已插下的晚稻占计划面积的76％，岛上许多县已转上田间管理。韶关专区的部分地区久旱不雨，影响晚稻插秧，这些地区都迅速组织群众，封江堵河、引水灌溉，实行抗旱抢插。汕头专区的七十多万亩受旱稻田，经过群众日夜车水灌溉，已有五十万亩解除了旱患。
    各地在抢插中，都认真贯彻以合理密植为中心的先进技术措施，保证晚稻插秧达到高标准、高质量。汕头专区从7月中旬起，每天都出动六十多万人大搞积肥、制肥，全区最近已有十亿担肥料送下田。此外，各地还大力推广稻草回田的作法，仅江门、韶关等专区已经进行稻草回田的面积就达五百多万亩。全省已插的晚稻，一般都符合密植要求。
    全省各地千方百计扩大晚稻和杂粮的种植面积。从6月初到7月底，全省已种下杂粮九百六十万亩，为去年同期的三倍。
    据新华社南宁3日电　广西农村各人民公社，争时间、抢季节，力争立秋前后保质保量地完成晚稻插秧任务。
    到29日止，全自治区已种下晚稻三百五十多万亩。为了不误季节地把全部晚稻在立秋前后插完，各级党委都进一步集中劳动力，加强
  “双抢”战线。目前，全区投入田间生产的劳动力已由7月19日的三百七十七万人激增到目前的五百多万人。博白县由于集中了80％的劳动力，虽然晚稻面积比早稻扩大了九万亩，但到7月25日止，种下的晚稻已占种植计划的72％。各地在抢插当中，都十分注意种植的规格质量。
    各地千方百计开展高工效运动来加快抢收抢种工作。全区制成的插秧机，约比春插时增加一倍，现在，大部分都投入抢插。宁明县三十六万多亩晚稻有68％是用插秧机插秧，到7月下旬已全面完成抢种任务，比去年同期提早十多天。
    在晚稻抢种中，全区有六万多名干部深入农业生产第一线参加生产领导生产。他们特别抓紧对后进队的领导。百色县下乡的十三个县委书记、委员和全县二十一个公社党委书记，都在后进队落户，促使全县抢收抢种较慢的二十三个大队都赶上了先进队，因而全县抢收抢种比初期加快一倍多。抢插得快的宁明县，在7月中旬，还抽出三百多个劳动力，扛着一百五十架插秧机，到毗邻的上思县去帮助抢插。
    本报杭州3日电　浙江省各地热烈响应省委“奋战十天夺取夏收夏种全胜”的号召，各级党委采取有力措施，充分发动群众，集中一切可以集中的劳力，狠抓以“五保”（保面积、保季节、保密植、保基肥、保深耕）为中心的晚稻插秧，力争晚稻超早稻。
    浙江省今年的早、晚稻种植面积都比去年扩大，收种面积占全年粮食总播种面积的60％以上，胜利完成夏收夏种任务，是今年实现粮食生产持续跃进的关键。因此，各级领导干部纷纷到任务最繁重的地区，领导夏收夏种。嘉兴专区已集中87％的劳动力到收种战线上来，加快了进度，保证了质量，日插进度比去年同期提高一倍左右。到7月28日止，全省收割的早稻已占应收面积的60％以上，插种的连作晚稻达计划面积的32.9％。（附图片）
