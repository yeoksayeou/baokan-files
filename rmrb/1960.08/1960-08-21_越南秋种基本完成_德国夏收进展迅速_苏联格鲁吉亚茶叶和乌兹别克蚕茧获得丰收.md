Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 19th: The late rice transplanting and miscellaneous grain planting work in Northern Vietnam has been basically completed, with many provinces and regions exceeding their planned targets.

During the transplanting and planting period, many areas in Northern Vietnam suffered from drought and water shortage, followed by excessive waterlogging, which brought serious difficulties to the transplanting and planting work. However, the organized farmers, under the strong leadership of the local Labor Party committees, brought into play the strength of the collective and launched a massive drought resistance and flood drainage campaign. Under the slogan of striving for a bumper late harvest, the farmers launched one production "battle" after another. Farmers in Nam Dinh Province, under the slogan of "Fighting in the Fields Against American Ngo Dinh Diem," completed the autumn plowing tasks ahead of schedule and achieved plowing, harrowing, and transplanting simultaneously. Farmers in Nghe An Province also expanded the late-season cultivation area by 14,000 hectares.

In order to complete the planned area for late rice transplanting and miscellaneous grain planting, various regions also adopted a series of effective measures. Due to water shortages and difficulties in seedling cultivation, direct seeding (i.e., sowing rice seeds directly into the paddy fields without going through the seedling cultivation process) was implemented for late rice in many areas. At the same time, wasteland reclamation and expansion of the multiple cropping area were carried out. According to statistics as of August 1st, the area planted with early-maturing late rice in various regions had expanded by about 35% compared with 1959.

At present, farmers in various regions are advancing victoriously, strengthening field management, increasing fertilizer application, and actively preparing for disaster prevention.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 20th: The wheat harvest in the German Democratic Republic has entered its final stage. Currently, 75% of the national grain harvest has been completed, and oil crops have been harvested ten days earlier than last year.

The nationwide agricultural collectivization is playing a good role in this year's harvest work. Many agricultural production cooperatives that had already implemented collective farming during the spring sowing period are using machinery to harvest on large tracts of land in the wheat harvest, saving a lot of time, manpower, and material resources. The reason why the national oil crop harvest is faster than last year is also the result of the comprehensive collectivization of agriculture.

In this year's harvest work, the Party and the state have provided considerable technical and manpower assistance and support to state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives in various regions. The state has supplied a lot of tractors and combine harvesters to agriculture. Technical socialist assistance has also been organized between regions according to the timing of crop maturity. In the past two days, more than 120 tractors and harvesters from the Cottbus and Frankfurt districts have been supporting the harvest in the Neubrandenburg district.

In order to gain time, thousands of workers, People's Army officers and soldiers, cadres of Party and state organs, housewives, and people from all walks of life across the country have responded to the call of the Party and the state and gone to the countryside on weekends and Sundays to help with the harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 20th: The Georgian Republic, located on the beautiful coast of the Caspian Sea and accounting for 97% of the Soviet Union's tea production, has achieved an unprecedented bumper tea harvest this year.

As of July 28, the collective farms in the subtropical region of the republic had harvested a total of 110,000 tons of tea, which is 14,000 tons more than in the same period of 1959, the year of the largest bumper harvest. It is estimated that the tea planters in the republic will harvest at least 150,000 tons of tea this year, which is close to the 1965 level stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965).

The Uzbek Republic, which is the most developed sericulture area in the Soviet Union, has also achieved its largest silkworm cocoon harvest in history this year. Collective farmers in the republic have delivered 14,301 tons of raw silk cocoons to the state, which is 1,565 tons more than in 1959. Procurement work is continuing in many regions of the republic, and the total procurement volume is expected to reach the 1965 target set by the Seven-Year Plan. The republic delivers approximately half of the total cocoon procurement in the Soviet Union each year.

### 越南秋种基本完成　德国夏收进展迅速  苏联格鲁吉亚茶叶和乌兹别克蚕茧获得丰收

    越南秋种基本完成　德国夏收进展迅速
    苏联格鲁吉亚茶叶和乌兹别克蚕茧获得丰收
    新华社河内19日电　越南北方的晚稻插秧和杂粮种植工作已经基本完成，许多省区超额完成了计划。
    在插秧和种植期间，越南北方许多地区天旱缺水，接着又水多成涝，给插秧和种植工作带来了严重困难。但是，组织起来的农民，在各地劳动党委员会的坚强领导下，发挥集体力量，展开了声势浩大的抗旱和排涝运动。农民在力争晚造大丰收的口号下，发动了一个接一个的生产“战役”。南定省农民在“奋战田间抗美吴”的口号下，提早完成了秋耕任务，并且做到边犁、边耙、边插秧。义安省农民也扩大晚造耕种面积一万四千公顷。
    为了完成晚稻插秧和杂粮种植面积计划，各地还采取了一系列有效措施。由于缺水，育苗困难，许多地区的晚稻实行了直播（即不经过育苗过程而直接把稻种播在稻田里），同时进行开荒和扩大复种面积。据截至8月1日的统计，各地已经种植的晚稻早熟稻面积，比1959年扩大了约35％。
    目前，各地农民正在乘胜前进，加强田间管理，增施肥料，并积极作好防灾的准备工作。
    新华社柏林20日电　德意志民主共和国的麦收工作已进入最后阶段。目前，全国谷物收割工作已完成75％，油料作物已比去年提前十天收获完毕。
    全国农业合作化在今年的收获工作中起着很好的作用。很多在春播期间已经实行集体耕种的农业生产合作社在麦收中用机器在大片土地上进行收获，节约了不少时间、人力和物力。今年全国的油料作物之所以比去年收获得快，也是农业实行全面合作化的结果。
    在今年的收获工作中，党和国家从技术上和人力上给予各地国营农场和农业合作社以不少帮助和支援。国家为农业供应了不少拖拉机和联合收割机。在地区之间，还根据作物成熟迟早的情况，组织了技术上的社会主义帮助。近两天来，科特布斯和法兰克福专区的一百二十多台拖拉机和收割机正在支援新勃兰登勃专区的收获。
    为了赢得时间，全国各专区成千的工人、人民军军官、士兵、党和国家机关干部、家庭妇女等各阶层人民也响应党和国家的号召，在周末、星期日纷纷下乡帮助收割。
    新华社莫斯科20日电　位于风景优美的里海沿岸的、占苏联产茶量97％的格鲁吉亚共和国，今年的茶叶获得了历史上空前的大丰收。
    截至7月28日，共和国亚热带地区的集体农庄共采茶十一万吨，比最大丰收年1959年的同一时期还要多一万四千吨。据估计，共和国植茶者今年至少要采茶十五万吨，即接近七年计划（1959年—1965年）所规定的1965年的水平。
    苏联养蚕业最发达的乌兹别克共和国今年的蚕茧也获得了历史上最大丰收。共和国集体农民已经向国家交售了一万四千三百零一吨生蚕丝，即比1959年多一千五百六十五吨。采购工作在共和国许多地区继续进行，总采购量预计可达到七年计划所规定的1965年的指标。共和国每年所交售的蚕茧约占苏联全国采购量的一半。
