Xingning adopts the method of "four stays, three rotations, two meetings, and one help" to combine point and area, achieving results in all directions from one successful effort.

(Our report) How can leading cadres at the county level, after leaving their offices and going deep into the grassroots, both do a good job at key points and do a good job in the broader areas, so that various tasks can be developed comprehensively, balancedly, or relatively balancedly? The Xingning County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has initially explored a set of effective methods.

In recent months, most of the leading cadres at the Xingning County level have gone deep into the grassroots. In the early stages of going to the countryside, some comrades (including cadres at the commune level), due to insufficient understanding of the relationship between points and areas, believed that after going deep into one point, it would be difficult to take care of the work in the broader areas. Therefore, the phenomenon of "focusing on points while neglecting areas" appeared. In addition, some comrades, after going down, wanted to quickly change the face of backward areas, so they clung to one point, and did not pay enough attention to the work in the broader areas, so that they could not well grasp the overall situation and provide timely work guidance, which affected the development of work in the broader areas. In some individual places, the work in key areas was vigorous, but from a comprehensive point of view, there was a phenomenon of little momentum and slow action. In response to this situation, the Xingning County Committee conducted several special studies on the combination of points and areas, and summarized practical experience, so that this problem was basically solved.

The Xingning County Committee, according to the local situation of being a semi-mountainous area with vast land and dispersed residents, implemented the "2-8 system" and the method of "four stays, three rotations, two meetings, and one help" to solve the problem of combining points and areas. The "2-8 system" means spending eight days out of ten going deep into the grassroots and two days going to the field or returning to the county for meetings to study work. "Four stays, three rotations, two meetings, and one help" is a specific arrangement of the ten days, that is, spending four days living in the key teams; three days running around the area; two days returning to the county or going to the field to meet and study work; and one day specifically helping commune leaders and cadres solve problems. During the stay in the team, the daily schedule is generally to take a walk in the fields in the morning, participate in labor and take the lead in the morning, delve into experience in the afternoon (such as going to the fields to inspect and study problems, etc.), and study or hold meetings, visit, and have discussions in the evening. After adopting these work methods, the phenomenon of "focusing on points while neglecting areas" has been basically overcome, so that point and area work can be closely combined.

In late May, Li Enzhong, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, went to the Shenguang Brigade of Diaofang Commune to be "four togethers" with the masses and found that there were many production tasks at that time, but they could be summarized into eight main items. After the practice of these eight production tasks by the Shenguang Brigade, they were promoted throughout the county and became a vigorous "Eight Great Production" movement. These problems were not discovered all at once. Initially, Comrade Li Enzhong found in the Shenguang Brigade that there were six tasks to be grasped at that time, namely, eliminating the third category of seedlings, planting more coarse grains, running canteens on a large scale, vigorously raising pigs, building good water-powered processing stations, and weeding. Later, he ran around the area and found that these six tasks were not only of great significance in the Shenguang Brigade, but also fully in line with the situation of the whole county. However, according to the situation of the whole county, these six tasks were not comprehensive enough, and after research, two points were added: doing a good job in flood prevention and preparedness, repairing all rivers, ditches, and dangerous sections of reservoir dikes, and vigorously accumulating fertilizer and carrying out preparations for late rice planting; and the fourth item was changed to vigorously carry out agricultural technology transformation, and the sixth item was changed to vigorously develop diversified operations. In this way, it was more complete than before. After this practice gained experience in the Shenguang Brigade, the Xingning County Committee promoted this work arrangement throughout the county. The county party committees and commune party committees in charge of different areas also imitated this method and made comprehensive arrangements for the work according to the specific conditions of their localities, so that all tasks were developed.

In order to correctly handle the relationship between central work and departmental work, the Xingning County Committee, in addition to establishing the above-mentioned system, also adopted the following two methods according to the specific conditions of the county: First, each time a county party committee meeting is held, let the leading cadres of the departments go to their respective departments for activities first, and then gather for joint research. While discussing the central work, the departments put forward work plans, which are uniformly deployed by the county party committee, and divided responsibilities. Second, wherever the responsible cadres of the departments go, the focus of the departments is there, and experience is created there, on-site visits are organized on the spot, and then comprehensively promoted. In this way, the central work is not only grasped well, but also the departmental work is done well at the same time by using the method of combining points and areas. For example, Li Qing, the secretary of the county party committee in charge of finance and trade, after going to the Fuxing Brigade of Xinpi Commune, while grasping the central work, took the time to investigate and study issues related to grain and finance and trade work. He found that Luo Fuhua, the finance and trade secretary of the commune living in the Wuli Brigade of Xinpi Commune, had very good experience in leading diversified operations and managing the canteen well. Comrade Li Qing introduced and promoted this experience in Xinpi Commune, and then promoted it throughout the county.

    兴宁采取“四蹲、三转、二碰、一帮”方法作到点面结合
    一处工作开花　四面八方结果
    本报讯　县委一级领导干部走出办公室，深入基层后，怎样既做好点的工作又做好面的工作，使各项工作得以全面地、平衡地或比较平衡地发展？中共广东兴宁县委初步摸索出了一套有效的方法。
    近几个月来，兴宁县委一级领导干部大部分都深入到基层。下乡初期，有些同志（包括公社级的干部）由于对点与面的关系认识不足，认为深入一点以后，面上的工作难以照料。因此，曾出现“顾点失面”的现象。另外，有些同志下去后，由于想迅速改变落后地区的面貌，便死抓一点，对面上的工作照顾得不够，以致不能很好地掌握全面情况和及时地进行工作指导，影响了面上工作的开展。有个别地方曾因此出现重点地区的工作轰轰烈烈，而从全面来看却出现了声势不大、行动迟慢的现象。针对这一情况，兴宁县委对点与面的结合问题，作了几次专门研究，并总结了实践经验，使这一问题得到了基本解决。
    兴宁县委根据当地是半山区，土地辽阔，下去的人住得分散的情况，实行“二八制”，和“四蹲、三转、二碰、一帮”的方法，来解决点面结合问题。“二八制”，是十天中八天深入基层，两天到现场或回县碰头，研究工作。“四蹲、三转、二碰、一帮”是把十天时间，作出具体的安排，即四天住在重点队；三天跑面；两天回县或到现场碰头，研究工作，一天具体帮助公社领导和干部解决问题。在住队期间，每天时间的安排，一般是早晨到田间转一转，上午参加劳动带头干，下午钻经验（例如到田间检查，研究问题等），晚上自己学习或开会、访问、座谈等。采取这些工作方法后，基本上克服了“顾点失面”的现象，使点面工作能够紧密地结合起来。
    5月下旬，县委第一书记栗恩仲下到刁坊公社神光大队与群众“四同”，发现当时的生产活路很多，但归纳起来主要有八项。这八项生产任务经过神光大队的实践以后，在全县推广，并成为轰轰烈烈的“八大生产”运动。这些问题并不是一下子就发现的。最初，栗恩仲同志在神光大队发现这个队当时要抓的有六项任务，即消灭三类禾、大种杂粮、大办食堂、大抓养猪、建好水力加工站、锄草。后来，他在面上跑，发现这六项任务不仅在神光大队有重要意义，而且完全符合全县的情况。但根据全县情况，这六项任务提得还不够全面，经过研究，又补充了两点：做好防洪防汛准备，培修所有江河、沟渠、水库堤围险段，和大力积肥、开展晚造备耕；并且把第四项改为大搞农业技术改造，第六项改为大搞多种经营。这样一来，比原来的更加完整。当这种做法在神光大队取得经验后，兴宁县委便将这个工作安排的做法，在全县推广。分片负责的县委和公社党委也仿照这个办法，根据当地的具体情况，对工作进行了全面安排，使各项工作都得到发展。
    为了正确处理中心工作与部门工作的关系问题，兴宁县委又根据本县的具体情况，除了建立上述的制度以外，还采取了下面两个办法：第一，在每次召开县委会议时，先让部门的领导干部去本部门活动一下，然后集中碰头研究。在讨论中心工作的同时，由部门提出工作方案，由县委统一部署，分工负责。第二，部门的负责干部深入到哪里，部门的重点就在哪里，并在那里创造出经验，就地组织现场参观，然后全面推广。这样，既抓好了中心工作，又运用点面结合的方法同时搞好部门工作。例如，专管财贸工作的县委书记李青，下到新陂公社福兴大队后，在抓好中心工作的同时，抽出手来调查研究有关粮食、财贸工作上的问题。他发现住在新陂公社五里大队的公社财贸书记罗富华，在领导多种经营和管好食堂方面经验很好。李青同志便把这个经验在新陂公社介绍推广，接着又在全县进行推广。
