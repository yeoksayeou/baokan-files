Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd: The news of the Soviet spaceship's safe return to Earth has shocked the entire Western world.

The Soviet Union's astonishing achievement has caused a sensation in the United States. All New York newspapers published news of "Little Arrow" and "Squirrel's" safe return to Earth, along with facsimile photographs. In Washington, people were discussing it, with some saying, "The Russians have proven once again that they are ahead of us." The "New York Times" admitted that the Soviet Union's plan to send humans into space far exceeds that of the United States.

This major news has also become the focus of attention for British newspapers. The "Daily Mail" editorial said that now "the honor definitely belongs to the Russians."

A reporter for the French newspaper "Le Figaro," reporting from New York, also wrote that the United States thought they would be victorious in the race to fly into space, but now they also admit that the first cosmonaut will be a Soviet citizen.

West German newspapers published commentaries on the 22nd, generally acknowledging that American science is far behind that of the Soviet Union. An editorial in "Die Welt" said that the competition to send the first person into outer space has entered a decisive stage. All indications suggest that the first "Columbus of outer space" will be a Soviet citizen.

Japanese radio commented that regarding the retrieval of artificial satellites, the United States first retrieved the spy satellite "Discoverer XIII" on the 11th of this month, but that was for war purposes, and the machinery inside was also for war. It was only about the size of a bucket and could not carry people. Therefore, American satellites are no longer the center of people's attention.

    宇宙飞船成就震动西方世界
    英法西德报纸承认苏联科学大大超过了美国
    日本电台嘲笑用于战争目的的美国间谍卫星
    据新华社22日讯　苏联宇宙飞船安全返回地面的消息，震惊了整个的西方世界。
    苏联这一惊人成就轰动了美国，所有的纽约报纸都刊登了“小箭”和“松鼠”安全返回地面的消息和它们的传真照片。在华盛顿，人们纷纷议论，有人说：“俄国人再次证明他们是走在我们前边”。“纽约时报”承认，苏联关于把人射入宇宙空间的计划大大地超过了美国。
    这个重大消息也成了英国报纸注意的中心。“每日邮报”社论中说，现在“荣誉肯定地归于俄国人”。
    法国“费加罗报”的记者从纽约发回的报道中也写道：美国想在飞入宇宙的竞赛中他们会获得胜利，但是现在他们也承认第一个宇宙航行者将会是苏联人了。
    西德报纸22日发表评论，公认美国科学大大落后于苏联。“世界报”社论说，争取向宇宙空间派出第一个人的竞赛已进入决定性阶段。有一切迹象可以预言第一个“宇宙空间的哥伦布”是苏联人。
    日本的电台评论道，关于收回人造卫星的问题，本月11日美国第一次收回了间谍卫星“发现者十三号”，但那是以战争为目的的，里面的机械也是为战争的，大小只有水桶一般大，还不能装人。因此，美国的卫星已不是人们话题的中心了。
