Xinhua News Agency report:

    Guinan County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, is reaping the rich fruits of the sheep production boom. Several tens of thousands of ewes and she-goats that gave birth to winter lambs about half a year ago are now starting to produce their second litter after artificial estrus induction and hot mating. So far, the county has produced 5,449 second-litter lambs, with a survival rate of over 97%.

    In the past, it was considered a matter of course for a ewe to produce one litter of lambs a year, because a ewe's gestation period is about five months, and it takes more than half a year for it to come into heat again after giving birth. In order to break this convention and explore ways to increase sheep production, under the guidance of the General Line, in the autumn of 1958, the Guinan County Party Committee, in the Guomaying Commune, directly led members of the He'e Brigade to conduct experiments on artificial estrus induction and early mating of ewes. They selected 1,505 healthy, mature ewes from this brigade, used various drugs to induce estrus after they gave birth to winter lambs, and carried out hot mating. From the autumn of 1958, when these ewes conceived their first litter, to the summer of 1959, when they produced their second litter, they produced a total of 2,018 lambs in about a year, with 2,004 surviving, a breeding survival rate of over 133%; among them, a group of 110 ewes managed by model herder Ge Ri (Tibetan) had a breeding survival rate of over 188%, basically achieving two litters per year for each ewe.

    The Guinan County Party Committee promptly summarized this experience and called on the county to learn from Zhihe, catch up with Zhihe, and surpass Zhihe to develop sheep production at high speed. Herdsmen of all ethnic groups actively responded to the Party's call and launched a sheep production boom. All five communes and production teams in the county classified and ranked ewes, selecting healthy ewes of appropriate age and dividing them into high-yield groups planned to produce two litters a year and large-area high-yield groups planned to produce three litters in two years, with the remaining ewes as general sheep groups producing one litter a year. The ewes selected for the high-yield and large-area high-yield groups were strengthened in feeding, and artificial estrus induction and hot mating were carried out immediately after they gave birth to winter lambs. As a result, a total of 82,500 ewes came into heat and were mated in the county.

    Skillfully breaking through the "three barriers" and adhering to "full fatness" are important experiences gained by the high-yield sheep groups in Guinan County. The so-called "three barriers" are: the estrus barrier, the conception barrier, and the rearing barrier. The so-called "full fatness" is to ensure that ewes are fully fat in all seasons.

    Now, the second litters of lambs from the high-yield sheep groups in Guinan County have just begun to be born, and tens of thousands more lambs will be born soon. Old herdsmen are smiling and telling people: "Have you ever seen ewes give birth to sons like this? This is thanks to the Party's good leadership."

    This newspaper also reports that the Jiermu Branch of the Sanjiaocheng Stud Farm in Qinghai Province has successfully enabled young female sheep and yellow cattle to mate and give birth at an appropriately earlier age. This meaningful experiment has explored a new way to develop animal husbandry production at high speed.

    Of the 180 twelve-month-old ewes that came into heat and conceived at the Jiermu Branch, 151 have already given birth to lambs, and 29 are still to be delivered; of the 63 fifteen-month-old yellow cows that came into heat and conceived, 41 have given birth to calves, one of which even gave birth to twins, and the rest are about to give birth soon. According to custom, sheep mature at two years old and yellow cattle at three years old, and only after maturity can they be mated. Now, by appropriately advancing the mating age, the first calving period of sheep and cattle has been advanced by twelve months and nineteen months respectively. The young female livestock have not experienced any abortions, dystocia, monster fetuses, etc., and the lambs and calves that have been born are all alive and strong. The weight of the newborn lambs generally reaches five or six catties, and the physical condition and physiological condition of the postpartum female livestock are very good.

    Implementing the production policy of full fatness in all seasons proposed by the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee is the determining factor in the success of this experiment. In addition to having special personnel graze the experimental livestock groups to ensure 16 hours of grazing per day, the farm also regularly and quantitatively supplements them with table salt and bone meal, so the young female livestock are all fat and strong. The weight of the twelve-month-old Tibetan ewes has reached more than eighty catties, and their estrus period is also earlier than that of general ewes of the same age.

### 贵南县几万只母羊年产两次羔  三角城种羊场幼年母畜提前配种产仔试验成功

    贵南县几万只母羊年产两次羔
    三角城种羊场幼年母畜提前配种产仔试验成功
    据新华社讯　青海海南藏族自治州贵南县各人民公社正在收获羊只丰产运动的硕果。几万只在半年左右以前产过冬羔的母绵羊、母山羊，经过人工催情和热胎配种，现在又开始产第二胎羔。到目前，全县已产二胎羔五千四百四十九只，成活率达到97％以上。
    母羊一年产一次羔，过去被认为是天经地义的事情，因为母羊怀一胎羔要五个月左右，产后又需要半年以上时间才发情。为了打破这种常规，探索羊只丰产途径，在总路线的指引下，1958年秋天，中共贵南县委在过马营公社直核大队领导社员对母羊进行了人工催情提前配种的试验。他们选择了这个大队的一千五百零五只适龄健壮母绵羊，在冬季产羔后用各种药剂注射催情，进行热胎配种。这些母羊从1958年秋季怀第一胎羔到1959年夏季产完第二胎羔为止，在一年左右的时间内共产羔二千零一十八只，成活二千零四只，繁殖成活率达到133％以上；其中，模范放牧员格日（藏族）经管的一群一百一十只母羊，繁殖成活率超过188％，基本上做到只只母羊年产两胎。
    中共贵南县委及时总结了这一经验，号召全县学直核、赶直核、超直核，高速度发展羊只生产。各族牧民积极响应党的号召，掀起了羊只丰产运动。全县五个公社和各个生产队都对母羊进行分类排队，挑选适龄健壮的母羊，划分为计划一年产两胎的高额丰产群和两年产三胎的大面积丰产群，其余的母羊作为一年一胎的一般羊群。对选入高额丰产群和大面积丰产群的母羊加强饲养，去冬产羔后立即进行人工催情和热胎配种，结果，全县共有八万二千五百多只母羊发情受配。
    巧破“三关”，坚持“一满”，是贵南县各公社丰产羊群获得丰产的重要经验。所谓“三关”是：发情关、受胎关和育幼关。所谓“一满”，是保证母羊四季满膘。
    现在，贵南县丰产羊群的第二胎羔羊才刚刚开始生产，还有几万只羔羊将在最近出生。老牧人看到这种景象都笑逐颜开地对人说：“你看到过母羊像这样连生贵子的么。这是有了党的好领导才得来的。”
    本报讯　青海省三角城种羊场吉尔木分场使绵羊、黄牛幼年母畜适当提前配种产仔成功。这一有意义的试验，为高速度发展畜牧业生产又摸索到一条新途径。
    吉尔木分场一百八十只十二月龄发情受胎的母绵羊，目前已有一百五十一只产羔，还有二十九只待产；六十三头十五月龄发情受胎的母黄牛有四十一头产仔，其中一头还产了双犊，其余的也即将产犊。按照习惯，绵羊两岁成年，黄牛三岁成年，成年后才能配种。现在，适当提早配种，羊、牛的初产期便分别提前了十二个月和十九个月，幼年母畜没有发生任何流产、难产、怪胎等现象，已产下的羔、犊全活全壮，初生羔羊体重普遍达到五六斤，产后母畜的体质和生理情况都很良好。
    贯彻中共青海省委提出的四季满膘的生产方针，是促使这项试验获得成功的决定因素。这个场对试验畜群除了专人放牧，保证每天放牧十六小时以外，还定期定量补饲食盐、骨粉，因而幼年母畜只只膘肥体壮。十二月龄的藏系母羊体重就达到八十斤以上，发情期也比一般同龄母羊早。
