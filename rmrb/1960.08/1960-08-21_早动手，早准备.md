Start Early, Prepare Early

Based on summarizing the experience of previous summer harvests, especially this year's summer harvest, Hubei Province has decided to actively expand the autumn planting area and increase the proportion of summer harvests. While concentrating superior forces to vigorously grasp the field management of current autumn harvest crops, they are also arranging a certain amount of force to carry out autumn planting preparation work centered on land reclamation and fertilizer accumulation, laying the foundation for winning the next summer harvest. This is a correct approach of looking at next year from this year, looking at the next season from this season, starting early and preparing early.

The current situation of developing agricultural production is very good. The great mass movement of the whole party and the whole people running agriculture and running grain in a big way, and the further realization of the superiority of the people's commune, have provided extremely favorable conditions for the great development of agricultural production. The task before us is to give full play to the active role of various favorable conditions and to give full play to the subjective initiative of people according to the objective laws of agricultural production, so as to promote the rapid development of agricultural production and promote the continuous leap forward of the entire national economy at a high speed and in proportion.

In the leadership of agricultural production, many advanced areas, such as Xiangyang area of Hubei, have always adhered to starting early and preparing early for several years. They prepare for autumn plowing and autumn planting as soon as the summer harvest is over, creating conditions for next summer's bumper harvest; they prepare for next year's spring plowing and spring planting after the autumn harvest is over, laying a good foundation for the next autumn harvest. In this way, the work becomes more and more active, and the production becomes more and more developed. However, some areas are not making sufficient preparations so early; individual areas are even sharpening their knives at the last minute and fighting in a hurry. This year, we must carry forward the good practice of the former, strive for the initiative and avoid being passive.

In doing any work, we must look at the next step from the previous step and prepare for the next step to win a greater victory. This is especially true of agricultural production. Spring planting and autumn harvest, autumn planting and summer harvest. From the perspective of the growth of a crop, under roughly the same natural conditions, the quality of the harvest first depends on the quality of the sowing, that is, whether the land is deeply ploughed, whether the base fertilizer is sufficient, whether the water source is guaranteed, and whether the seedlings are densely planted; and these tasks often depend on the quality of fertilizer accumulation, seed retention, deep ploughing and water conservancy construction. Planting is the foundation, and management is the guarantee. If these tasks are done well, the crops are planted well, and then field management is closely grasped, weeding and topdressing, preventing drought and waterlogging, and eliminating insects and pests can ensure a bumper harvest. If these tasks are not done well and the crops are not planted well, although subsequent field management can also play some role, the congenital weakness can only be remedied, and it is difficult to fundamentally save it. Of course, if only planting is done well, and field management work is not followed up, the crops cannot grow well. The planting, management and harvesting of each crop are interlocked, and the next link must be prepared when the previous link is grasped, and no link can be relaxed. Furthermore, from the perspective of the relationship between crops that are continuously grown, the next season's crops must be connected to the previous season's crops, and the appropriate planting season must be seized. It is necessary to make thorough plans and arrangements when planting the previous season's crops so that the crops are connected one after another and the farm work is staggered. If these tasks are arranged properly, the previous season's crops can be harvested as soon as possible, and the next season's crops can be planted immediately, so that production can be carried out season after season throughout the year, the yield of crops can be increased, and labor can also be arranged. On the contrary, if these tasks are not arranged properly in advance, it will inevitably cause the farm work of the next season's crops to be crowded together, the labor force cannot be deployed, and the appropriate season will be delayed.

The masses say: "One day in summer planting is equivalent to one hour in autumn planting." Agricultural production is extremely seasonal, and many tasks must be completed in a very short period of time. Wheat harvest "four quick" (quick harvest, quick transportation, quick threshing, quick storage), autumn "double grab" (grabbing early rice harvest, grabbing late rice transplanting), is naturally worth every second, and we must concentrate our efforts to seize the opportunity. Even weeding and topdressing have a certain season, and the effect will be reduced if the timing is missed. Therefore, in terms of manpower, animal power, tools, fertilizers, and seeds, we should be fully prepared in advance, and when the season comes, all the troops will go up together to seize the opportunity. Seizing the season in agricultural production can take the initiative one step at a time, and the whole season will be active.

"One early leads to a hundred earlies, one initiative leads to a hundred initiatives." Early deliberation, early arrangement, early preparation, and early action are the specific application of the guiding ideology of "not fighting unprepared battles, not fighting battles without certainty of victory" in agricultural work. Xiangyang area has firmly grasped the word "early" in the past few years. Their autumn planting area has expanded from 7 million mu to 12 million mu, and the paddy field area has expanded from 3 million mu to 6 million mu. Some of their labor force has also been transferred away for the needs of running industry, etc., but their work is very active, and production is developing by leaps and bounds. The reason is that although agricultural production is very busy, there are large and small busy seasons, especially busy and not too busy seasons. Their leadership and planned grasping of "early" is actually doing many of the tasks of the busy season in advance on days that are not too busy, and staggering the farm work, so that they can concentrate their efforts to complete the main tasks in the busy season. Of course, initially, changing from only taking care of the present to taking care of both the present and the future will increase the farm work and make the work more tense. However, if we do not make up our minds to overcome difficulties, if we do not try to take one more step early, we will never be able to take the lead, or even become more and more passive, which will make the future even more tense. Can the difficulty of taking one more step be overcome? The answer is yes. The way to do this is to grasp the word "skillful" while grasping "early", to work skillfully and arrange skillfully. The so-called "skillful work" is what the masses say "to ask for labor from tool reform," vigorously promote new-style farm tools, promote advanced experience, improve work efficiency, and save labor. The so-called "skillful arrangement" is to stand high, look far, and make comprehensive arrangements for the whole year's work, and even the next year's work; in the comprehensive arrangement, to combine the work that can be combined, to grasp the central link to drive the overall situation; those that cannot be combined should distinguish between primary and secondary urgency, concentrate the main force to complete the main tasks, and at the same time arrange a certain force to establish a professional team to carry out the preparation work for the next step. For example, Hubei and other places are currently taking advantage of the slack season of plowing cattle to arrange a certain amount of labor to reclaim land early in the morning and late in the evening, which does not affect the current field management, but expands the cultivated area, which is conducive to concentrating efforts to deeply plow the land in the next autumn plowing season; now that the land is reclaimed, the newly turned soil can be thoroughly ripened in the hot weather, which can also improve the fertility of the land and produce more grain.

Whether we can start early and prepare early depends on whether the leading cadres at all levels are familiar with and master the objective laws of agricultural production. Comrade Mao Zedong said in the article "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War": "An experienced soldier, if he is open to learning, he is familiar with the temperament of his own troops (commanders, combatants, weapons, supplies, etc. and their totality), and he is also familiar with the temperament of the enemy's troops (similarly, commanders, combatants, weapons, supplies, etc. and their totality), and he is familiar with all other conditions related to the war, such as politics, economy, geography, climate, etc. Such a soldier is more certain and more likely to win battles when commanding wars or operations. This is the result of recognizing the situation of both the enemy and ourselves over a long period of time, finding out the laws of action, and solving the contradiction between the subjective and the objective." Only by being familiar with war can we win war, and only by being familiar with production can we lead production. The broad masses of cadres across the country have gone deep among the masses and into the front line, and have seriously studied the objective laws of agricultural production and improved their leadership methods, which is a good phenomenon. As long as we persist in this way, we will definitely be able to improve the leadership level of agricultural production and promote the high-speed development of agricultural production.

    早动手，早准备
    湖北省在总结历年夏收经验，特别是今年夏收经验的基础上，决定积极扩大秋种面积，增加夏收的比重。他们在集中优势力量狠抓当前秋收作物田间管理的同时，还安排一定的力量，进行以开荒、积肥为中心的秋种准备工作，为夺取明年夏季丰收打基础。这是今年看明年，上季看下季，早动手、早准备的正确作法。
    当前发展农业生产的形势是非常好的。全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的伟大的群众运动的开展，人民公社的优越性的进一步的发挥，为农业生产的大发展提供了极为有利的条件。摆在我们面前的任务，就是根据农业生产的客观规律，充分发挥各种有利条件的积极作用，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，促进农业生产迅速发展，促进整个国民经济高速度按比例地持续跃进。
    在农业生产领导上，许多先进地区，如湖北襄阳等地区，几年以来，始终坚持早动手、早准备，夏收刚罢就准备秋耕秋种，为来年夏季丰收创造条件；秋收结束就准备来年春耕春种，为来年秋收打好基础。这样，工作越来越主动，生产越来越发展。但是，也有些地区却不是这样早作充分准备；有个别地区甚至临阵磨枪，仓促应战。今年，我们一定要发扬前一种的好作法，力争主动，避免被动。
    做任何工作，都要在上一步看下一步，为下一步夺取更大胜利做好准备。农业生产更是如此。春种秋收，秋种夏收，从一种作物的生长来看，在自然条件大体相同的条件下，收成的好坏首先取决于播种的质量怎样，即土地是否深耕、底肥是否施足、水源是否保证、苗子是否密植等等；而这些工作往往又取决于积肥、留种、深耕和水利建设等工作的好坏。种是基础，管是保证。这些工作都做好了，庄稼种好了，再紧紧抓住田间管理，除草追肥，防旱防渍，除虫灭害，就能确保丰收。要是这些工作没做好，庄稼没种好，以后的田间管理虽然也能起些作用，但毕竟先天弱了，只能作些补救，很难根本挽救。当然，如果只是种好了，而田间管理工作没有跟上，庄稼也不能长好。每种作物的种、管、收，都是一环扣一环，必须抓着上一环就看下一环，为下一环作好准备，任何一环都不能放松。再从上下连作的作物之间的关系来看，下季作物要跟上季作物衔接上，并且抢住适当的种植季节，必须在种上一季作物的时候，就进行周密的计划和安排，使其茬茬衔接，农活错开。这些工作安排得当，就能做到上季作物刚收，下季作物立即种上，使生产一季紧接一季，全年作物产量增加，劳力也能安排过来。相反，这些工作如不及早安排得当，势必造成下季作物农活挤在一起，劳力调配不开，以致延误适当季节。
    群众说：“夏种一日，秋种一时。”农业生产的季节性极强，许多工作都必须在极短的时日里完成。麦收“四快”（快收、快运、快打、快入库），秋季“双抢”（抢收早稻、抢插晚稻），自然是一刻千金，必须集中力量抢住火色。就是除草追肥，也有一定时节，误过时机，效果也会减低。因此，在人力、畜力、工具、肥料、种籽等方面，应当事前准备充分，季节一到，万军齐上，抢住火候。在农业生产上抢住季节，就能做到一步主动，全季主动。
    “一早百早，一主动百主动”，早酝酿，早安排，早准备，早动手，就是“不打无准备的仗，不打无把握的仗”的指导思想在农业工作中的具体运用。襄阳地区几年来紧紧抓住“早”字，他们的秋种面积由七百万亩扩大到一千二百万亩，水田面积由三百万亩扩大到六百万亩，他们的劳动力还为办工业等需要调走了一些，但他们的工作很主动，生产在飞跃发展。原因就在于农业生产虽然很忙，但在季节上还有大忙、小忙之分，特别忙和不太忙之分。他们有领导、有计划地抓“早”，实际上是将大忙季节的许多工作，提前在不太忙的日子里作了，将农活错开了，在大忙季节更能集中力量完成主要任务。当然，最初由只顾眼前改为既顾眼前又顾将来，农活是要增加一些，工作是会紧张一些。但是，如果不下决心战胜困难，如果不想法提早多迈一步，就永远不能赶先一步，甚至越来越被动，反而会使以后更加紧张。多迈一步的困难能不能克服呢？回答是能克服的。办法是在抓“早”当中，还要抓住“巧”字，巧干活，巧安排。所谓“巧干活”，就是群众说的“向工具改革要劳力”，大力推行新式农具，推广先进经验，提高工效，节约劳力。所谓“巧安排”，就是要站得高，望得远，综观全年工作，以至下一年的工作，进行全面安排；在全面安排中，将能结合的工作结合进行，抓住中心一环带动全盘；不能结合的要分清主次缓急，集中主要力量完成主要任务，同时安排一定的力量，成立专业班子，进行下一步的准备工作。举例来讲，湖北各地目前趁耕牛伏闲季节，安排一定力量，每天一早一晚开荒，并不影响当前的田间管理，但是扩大了耕地面积，有利于下一步秋耕时节集中力量深翻土地；现在开了荒，使新翻的土在暑天熟透，还能提高地力，多产粮食。
    能不能早动手，早准备，关键在于各级领导干部要熟悉和掌握农业生产的客观规律。毛泽东同志在“中国革命战争的战略问题”一文中说：“经验多的军人，假使他是虚心学习的，他摸熟了自己的部队（指挥员、战斗员、武器、给养等等及其总体）的脾气，又摸熟了敌人的部队（同样，指挥员、战斗员、武器、给养等等及其总体）的脾气，摸熟了一切和战争有关的其他的条件如政治、经济、地理、气候等等，这样的军人指挥战争或作战，就比较地有把握，比较地能打胜仗。这是在长时间内认识了敌我双方的情况，找出了行动的规律，解决了主观和客观的矛盾的结果。”只有熟悉战争才能赢得战争，只有熟悉生产才能领导生产。全国各地广大干部纷纷深入群众，深入第一线，认真研究农业生产的客观规律，改进领导方法，这是一种好现象。只要这样坚持下去，一定可以把农业生产领导水平提高一步，促使农业生产高速度发展。
