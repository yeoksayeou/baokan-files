Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 31st. In the continuous Great Leap Forward of more than two years, the workers of Hebi Coal Mine in Henan Province have better understood and grasped the law of proportional development of high-speed tunneling and mining, thereby promoting the comprehensive and sustained leap forward in coal production. According to this law, while vigorously grasping the large-area high yield of mining faces, they have vigorously grasped tunneling work. In the first half of this year, tunneling completed 78% of the annual national plan, an increase of 1.4 times compared with the same period last year. The recoverable period of coal volume has now reached more than seven months, which has prepared sufficient conditions for high-yield mining. The entire mine completed half of the annual national raw coal production plan fifty days ahead of schedule in the first half of this year.

In the process of coal production, coal mining and tunneling are two major production links. A substantial increase in raw coal production requires tunneling to be accelerated; only by achieving high-speed tunneling can we ensure sufficient mining faces to enable a substantial and sustained increase in coal production. Therefore, how to correctly grasp the unity of contradictions between the two is a major key to whether we can take the initiative step by step in production. Since the beginning of this year, with the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the mine's workers have continuously reformed the coal mining methods and successively created successful coal mining methods such as "pin" shape and "one-time full-height mining of roadway-style thick coal seams," which promoted a substantial increase in raw coal production. This requires accelerating the speed of tunneling to consolidate this situation of substantial increase in production. Therefore, the Hebi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Coal Mine Party Committee, while grasping high output on the one hand, grasped tunneling on the other hand, further strengthened the leadership of tunneling work, and established tunneling committees headed by the Party Committee Secretary at all levels, and appropriately supplemented and expanded the tunneling team. In order to grasp it deeply and thoroughly, each mine also specially selected a deputy mine director, engineer, and technician to focus on tunneling work. The mining area tunneling team implemented the "five-fixed" method of fixed personnel, fixed tasks, fixed locations, fixed equipment, and fixed time, arranged tunneling plans monthly and every ten days, and checked the completion status daily and shiftly. This quickly reversed the passive situation in which tunneling lagged behind mining for a time, and maintained a balance between mining and tunneling on a new basis, winning the initiative in production.

In order to ensure the high-speed growth of tunneling, the mine also widely mobilized the masses to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, gradually realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of tunneling, and timely summarizing and promoting the experience of rapid tunneling, inserting red flags, establishing pacesetters, and carrying out the red flag competition movement of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping, which promoted the leap forward development of tunneling wave after wave. The Qi Hezhi Youth Rapid Tunneling Team of Chenjiazhuang Mine, under the leadership of the Party, has successively created fourteen kinds of tunneling machinery such as coal loaders, hand-cranked loading machines, spaceship-type transportation machines, belt loading machines, and notching machines, quickly realizing the mechanization of the entire tunneling process, and the moving scene of "no need to pick coal, no need to shovel coal, no need to axe the cut, machine out the post nest, no need to carry pit wood, machine to carry material, no need to blast slotting, high speed of erecting the shed" appeared, which promoted the monthly increase in tunneling footage. In May, this team created a national record of 2,013.7 meters of single-hole monthly advancement. The Hebi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Mine Party Committee timely summarized the rapid tunneling experience of the Qi Hezhi Tunneling Team, and mobilized all employees to launch a vigorous mass movement of learning, comparing, catching up, and surpassing Qi Hezhi, so that the team's advanced experience quickly blossomed and bore fruit throughout the mine. In June, four more tunneling teams broke through the 2,000-meter mark, increasing the mine's tunneling footage by 31.5% compared with May, preparing the prerequisite for high-speed mining.

Since the beginning of this year, the workers of Hebi Coal Mine have initially explored and summarized the law of actively organizing the balance of mining and tunneling to ensure the sustained leap forward in production. Specifically, it is necessary to master three proportional relationships. First, it is necessary to ensure that the growth rate of tunneling is greater than the growth rate of output. According to the current new coal mining method of one-time full-height mining, it is necessary to ensure that the growth rate of monthly tunneling footage is about twice the growth rate of output. That is, every thousand tons of raw coal must be tunneled at twenty-one to twenty-five meters (excluding post-mining tunneling). Therefore, while increasing production, it is necessary to increase the amount of tunneling proportionally to avoid the imbalance of mining and tunneling. Second, it is necessary to ensure that there is a sufficient amount of recoverable coal. According to production practice, the recoverable period of coal volume should be no less than six months. Third, it is necessary to ensure that there are more post-mining tunneling faces than mining faces. With the improvement of coal mining methods and the substantial increase in output, the original two tunneling faces to protect two mining faces are no longer suitable. Therefore, when arranging tunneling faces and mining faces, it is necessary to adopt the practice of "two tunneling to protect one mining" or "three tunneling to protect two mining" (that is, three tunneling faces to protect two tunneling faces) to ensure the normal succession of mining and tunneling. Production practice since the beginning of this year has proved that in order to organize the sustained leap forward in coal production, it is necessary to ensure the prior increase in tunneling, so that tunneling always runs ahead of production, so that continuous high production has no worries.

### 鹤壁煤矿逐步掌握了采和掘高速度按比例发展规律  掘进带头　回采跟上　持续高产

    鹤壁煤矿逐步掌握了采和掘高速度按比例发展规律
    掘进带头　回采跟上　持续高产
    新华社郑州31日电　河南鹤壁煤矿职工在连续两年多的大跃进中，更好地认识和掌握了掘进和回采高速度按比例发展的规律，从而促进了煤炭生产的全面持续跃进。他们依照这条规律，在大抓回采工作面大面积高产的同时，狠抓掘进工作，今年上半年掘进完成了全年国家计划的78％，比去年同期提高了一点四倍，获得煤量可采期目前已达到七个多月，为回采高产准备了充分的条件。全矿在今年上半年提前五十天完成了全年国家原煤产量计划的一半。
    在煤炭生产过程中，采煤和掘进是两个主要的生产环节，原煤产量大幅度增长，要求掘进必须加快；只有实现高速度掘进，才能保证足够的回采工作面使煤炭产量大幅度持续增长。因此，如何正确掌握这两者之间矛盾的统一，是能否取得生产步步主动的重大关键。今年以来，随着技术革新与技术革命运动的蓬勃发展，这个矿的职工对采煤方法进行了不断的改革，先后创造成功了“品”字形和“巷道式厚煤层一次采全高”等采煤法，促进了原煤产量的大幅度增长。这就要求加快掘进的速度，才能巩固这种大幅度增产的局面。因此，中共鹤壁市委和煤矿党委在一手抓高产的同时，一手抓掘进，进一步加强对掘进工作的领导，层层成立了以党委书记为首的掘进委员会，适当充实和扩大了掘进队伍。为了抓深抓透，各矿还专门抽出一名副矿长、工程师、技术员专抓掘进工作。采区掘进队实行定人员、定任务、定地点、定设备、定时间的“五定”办法，月月旬旬安排掘进计划，日日班班检查完成情况。从而迅速扭转了掘进一时落后于回采的被动局面，使采掘之间在新的基础上保持平衡，争得了生产的主动权。
    为了保证掘进的高速度增长，这个矿还广泛发动群众，大闹技术革新与技术革命，逐步实现掘进机械化、半机械化，并及时总结和推广快速掘进经验，插红旗，树标兵，开展学、比、赶、帮的红旗竞赛运动，推动了掘进一浪高过一浪地飞跃发展。陈家庄矿齐合只青年快速掘进队，今年以来，在党的领导下，先后创造了扒煤机、手摇装车机、飞船式运输机、皮带装车机、砍口机等十四种掘进机械，迅速实现了整个掘进工序的机械化，出现了“刨煤不用镐，攉煤不用锹，砍口不用斧，柱窝机器掏，坑木不用扛，运料机器捎，掏槽不放炮，架棚速度高”的动人景象，推动了掘进进尺月月上升。5月份这个队创造了单孔月进二千零一十三点七米的全国最高纪录。中共鹤壁市委和矿党委及时总结了齐合只掘进队的快速掘进经验，发动全体职工掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的学、比、赶、超齐合只的群众运动，使这个队的先进经验迅速在全矿普遍开花结果。6月份又有四个掘进队突破两千米大关，使全矿掘进进尺比5月份提高了31.5％，为高速回采准备了前提条件。
    今年以来，鹤壁煤矿职工在夺取煤炭高产中，已初步摸索和总结出积极组织采掘平衡，保证生产持续跃进的规律，具体来说，要掌握好三个比例关系。第一，必须保证掘进的增长速度大于产量的增长速度。根据现行的一次采全高的新采煤法，要保证每月掘进进尺的增长速度大于产量增长速度的两倍左右。即每千吨原煤必须掘进在二十—二十五米（不包括采后掘进）。因此在增产的同时，必须按比例地增加掘进量，以避免采掘失调。第二，必须保证有足够数量的获得煤量。根据生产实践，获得煤量的可采期应不少于六个月。第三，必须保证采后掘进工作面多于回采工作面。随着采煤方法的改进，产量的大幅度增长，原来的两个掘进头保两个回采头已不相适应，因此在安排掘进头和回采头的时候，必须采取“二掘保一采”或“三掘保二采”（即三个掘进头保二个掘进头）的做法，才能保证采掘的正常接替。今年以来的生产实践证明，要组织煤炭生产的持续跃进，必须保证掘进的优先增产，使掘进经常走在生产前面，才能使连续高产无后顾之忧。
