    The Wind is Warm, the Sun is Bright, and Flowers Rebloom
    Tibetan, Zha Xi Dun Zhu
    I was originally a serf who performed Tibetan opera and am now sixty years old. I spent fifty-nine years in the evil feudal serf society, enduring all kinds of torture and suffering, and only gained a new life last March. I am incredibly happy to be able to attend the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, especially to see our great leader Chairman Mao. Now I will share some of my feelings about attending this conference.
    Tibetan opera is one of China's many excellent opera genres, with a long history, distinct local characteristics, and unique national style. However, under the reactionary rule of the three major estate-holders, Tibetan opera not only failed to develop but also suffered merciless destruction. The fate of our Tibetan opera performers was the same as that of millions of serfs, suffering exploitation and oppression, losing not only political rights but also personal freedom. A slight gesture or word from the aristocratic lords could determine our life or death, so there was no freedom of cultural and artistic activities. Serfs and slaves owned nothing economically, only endlessly providing corvée labor for the three major estate-holders. Laboring heavier than cattle and horses, suffering more than cattle and horses, that was the portrayal of serfs.
    The art of serfs who performed Tibetan opera was only for the amusement and entertainment of the serf owners. (In the past, there were twelve Tibetan opera troupes exclusively serving the three major estate-holders.) Regardless of whether you were old or sick, you had to sing even if you couldn't, you had to dance even if you couldn't move, and singing out of tune was even worse. Any slight offense would immediately result in scolding and beatings from the lords. This kind of slave-like life for actors could only end with death. We artists, besides performing for the aristocratic lords, also had to go on corvée duty every autumn, performing for the Gaxag government, major monasteries, and major nobles. The artists, young and old, a group of people, with no zanba in their bags and not a penny in their pockets, begged for food along the way to survive. When they couldn't beg for food, they went hungry. After finishing the corvée and performing the opera, they had to return immediately. If they were late, the lord's henchmen would arrest us as "fugitives" and put us in jail. According to the serf owner's law, serfs had to pay a poll tax to the lord every year. However, we didn't have enough to eat or wear, so where would we get the money to pay the poll tax? We had to rely on begging or selling short-term labor to earn some money to pay the tax, otherwise, we would commit a deadly crime.
    The reactionary former local government of Tibet consistently adopted a policy of stifling Tibetan opera. Any plays that were beneficial to the people were banned from performance. As everyone knows, the Tibetan opera "Princess Wencheng" is one of the traditional plays loved by the Tibetan people. It vividly and powerfully praises the close relationship between the Tibetan and Han nationalities. "Nangsa Girl" is a story praising a female serf in the Jiangzi area of Tibet who resisted the oppression of the serf owners and eventually killed the serf owner. Nangsa Girl became a role model for the serfs and a beloved hero. However, the serf owners, feeling guilty, worried that one day the people would see through their faces and rise up to fight, so they ordered the arrest of the artists and serfs who sang this play. The foolish and ridiculous reactionary serf owners could put people in jail and put them in shackles, but the people's thoughts could never be locked up or forbidden. The "illegal" "Nangsa Girl" spread even wider, constantly inspiring the serfs' struggle.
    The serf owners confined Tibetan opera to the courts of the aristocratic lords, making the content of the scripts and the performance techniques adhere to conventions, not allowing the artists to make any changes, let alone create new scripts. This caused Tibetan opera to lose contact with the people, like flowers losing their soil, unable to survive. The brilliant artistic flowers withered. Under the destruction of the serf owners, almost all of the original twelve Tibetan opera troupes were buried. By the time of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, only our "Jue Mu Long" Tibetan opera troupe remained, but it was already on its last breath at that time. The tragic fate of Tibetan opera reflects the darkness, barbarity, and cruelty of the feudal serf system, fully exposing the reactionary essence of the serf owner class.
    After the victory of the suppression of the rebellion in Tibet in 1959, the great democratic reform movement began. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Tibetan people overthrew the three major estate-holders and the feudal serf system. Millions of serfs stood up! They achieved a great turnaround in politics and economics! At the same time, the art of Tibetan opera also received the attention and boundless care of the Party and the government. Our suffering artists were also quickly provided for in our lives. After the establishment of the Tibetan Opera Troupe of Tibet, it quickly developed a new force. I served as the head of the troupe, and soon I also became a member of the CPPCC. We were so excited that we couldn't speak, only shouting long live the Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!
    In the democratic reform movement, we accused the three major estate-holders of their bloody crimes, studied the Party's various policies, and greatly improved our class consciousness, throwing ourselves into our work with soaring revolutionary vigor. In our work, we adopted the principle of "walking on two legs," actively reforming traditional plays while arranging new plays. With the help of Han comrades, we quickly arranged the modern play "The Kindness of the People's Liberation Army" and adapted and performed traditional plays such as "Princess Wencheng" and "Nangsa Girl." The actors traveled in their own large vehicles to the countryside and to the troops, conducting performances of appreciation and receiving a warm welcome from the masses. We felt incredibly excited and thrilled because now we were serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, contributing our strength to the revolutionary cause!
    These facts show that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, in the big family of friendly cooperation among all nationalities, can Tibetan literature and art achieve great development and prosperity.

    风和日暖花重开
    藏族  扎西顿珠
    我原是一个演藏戏的农奴，今年六十岁了。在万恶的封建农奴社会里，度过了五十九年，受尽了种种折磨和苦难，直到去年3月才获得了新生。我能够出席全国第三次文代大会，特别是见到了我国各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席，更感到无比的幸福。现在我谈谈自己参加这次大会的一些感受。
    藏戏是我国许多优秀剧种之一，它有着悠久的历史，鲜明的地方色彩和民族的独特风格。但是，在三大领主的反动统治下，藏戏不但得不到发展，而且遭受着无情的摧残。我们藏戏艺人的命运和百万农奴一样，受尽剥削与压迫，不但失去了政治权利，而且完全失去了人身自由。贵族老爷抬一抬手，说一句话，就能支配我们的活与死，因此更谈不上什么文化艺术活动的自由权利了。农奴和奴隶，在经济上也一无所有，只是无限度地为三大领主支乌拉差役。劳动比牛马重，苦难比牛马多，这便是农奴的写照。
    演唱藏戏的农奴，他们的艺术，只能专供农奴主消遣、玩乐。（在过去专为三大领主支差的藏戏团就有十二个）他们不管你是年老或是有病，唱不出也得唱，跳不动也得跳，唱走了调就更不行，稍有触犯，马上就会遭到老爷们的痛骂和毒打，这种奴隶般的演员生活，除非死掉才能结束。我们这些艺人，平时除了为贵族老爷演戏外，每年秋季还得出差服役，为噶厦政府、大寺庙、大贵族演出。艺人们老老少少一群人，袋里没有糌巴，腰中没有分文，沿途讨饭糊口，讨不到吃的时候，便饿着肚子赶路。支完差演完戏又得马上往回走，走晚一步，老爷的狗腿子就会把我们当“逃亡犯”捉起来关进监牢里。按照农奴主的法律，农奴每年都必需向领主交纳人头税，可是，我们吃不饱，穿不暖，哪里有钱交人头税呢？这只好靠乞讨或是出卖短工赚几个钱，把税款交齐，不然又将犯下该死的罪过。
    反动的原西藏地方政府，对藏戏一贯采取扼杀的政策。凡对人民有益的剧目，它就禁止演出。大家知道，藏戏《文成公主》是西藏人民喜爱的传统剧目之一，它生动而有力地歌颂了藏汉民族之间亲密的关系；《囊萨姑娘》是歌颂西藏江孜地区的一个女农奴反抗农奴主的压迫，最后杀死农奴主的斗争故事。囊萨姑娘成了农奴的榜样，成了群众喜爱的英雄人物，而农奴主作贼心虚，担心总有一天人民会看破他们的面目，起来斗争，于是便下令捉拿唱这个戏的艺人和农奴。愚蠢得可笑的反动农奴主，他们可以将人关进监牢，戴上镣铐，但是人们的思想是永远锁不住，也禁不了的。“非法”的《囊萨姑娘》流传得更广了，她一直在鼓舞着农奴们的斗争。
    农奴主把藏戏禁锢在贵族老爷的宫庭里，使剧本内容、表演技巧墨守陈规，不许艺人有一点改动，更不准创作新的剧本，这便使藏戏和人民群众失去了联系，就像鲜花失去了土壤，无法生存下去。灿烂的艺术花朵枯萎了。在农奴主的摧残下，原有的十二个藏戏团，几乎全部被埋葬，到西藏和平解放时，只剩下了我们这个“觉木龙”藏戏团，但是它在当时也已经是奄奄一息了。藏戏的悲惨遭遇，反映了封建农奴制度的黑暗、野蛮和残酷，充分地暴露了农奴主阶级的反动本质。
    1959年西藏平叛胜利后，开始了伟大的民主改革运动。西藏人民，在中国共产党的领导下，推翻了三大领主和封建农奴制度。百万农奴站起来了！在政治上经济上都获得了大翻身！与此同时，藏戏的艺术也得到了党和政府的重视和无限关怀。我们这些受苦受难的艺人，在生活上也迅速得到了安排。西藏藏戏团成立后，很快便发展了一批新生力量。我担任了剧团团长，不久我还当上了政协委员，我们简直兴奋得说不出话来，只有高呼共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！
    在民主改革运动中，我们控诉了三大领主的血腥罪行，学习了党的各项政策，大大提高了阶级觉悟，以冲天的革命干劲投入了工作。我们在工作中采取了“两条腿走路”的方针，一边积极改革传统剧目，一边编排新的剧目。在汉族同志的帮助下，很快就编排出现代剧《解放军的恩情》，并改编上演了《文成公主》《囊萨姑娘》等传统剧目。演员们乘着自己的大汽车到农村，到部队，在各地进行了慰问演出，受到群众的热烈欢迎。我们感到无比激动、无比兴奋，因为现在我们是为工农兵服务，为革命事业贡献自己的力量了！
    这些事实说明：只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，在各民族友爱合作的大家庭中，西藏的文艺才能得到大发展，大繁荣。
