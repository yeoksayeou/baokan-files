    Using Limited Farmland to Produce More Grain
    ——The Experience of Jianyang County's Jiefang Commune in Extensively Promoting Intercropping and Relay Cropping
    By our reporter Liu Zongtang

    The Jiefang Commune in Jianyang County, Sichuan, has an average of 1.21 mu of land per person, and economic crops, mainly cotton, occupy more than half of the planting area each year. For a long time, there has been a difficult problem in production: economic crops and food crops compete for land, time, and labor.

    Under these circumstances, most areas still follow small-scale farming practices, often sacrificing one crop to satisfy another. For example, in order to plant spring economic crops early and rotate crops, the planting area of winter food crops is greatly reduced, with as many as 20,000 to 30,000 mu of winter land left fallow each year. As a result, the increase in grain production is slow, and before communization, the food rations of commune members relied on state supply every year. Cotton production also fluctuated due to the frequent setbacks in grain production.
    "Now we've found the way!"

    After the establishment of the commune in October 1958, under the guidance of the Party Central Committee's principle of "taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development," the Prefectural Committee and County Committee, in light of local conditions, issued the instruction of "grasping the key points (grain) and highlighting the characteristics (cotton)." The Commune Party Committee clarified the direction of struggle, mustered energy, and loudly put forward the guarantee that "cotton should be a red banner bearer, and grain should not be a handout receiver," leading all commune members to work hard and practically, determined to win a double bumper harvest of grain and economic crops.

    Cadres and masses worked together to find ways to develop both grain and cotton at high speed, starting from the specific conditions of the commune. There was no wasteland to reclaim here, but the climate was relatively mild, with a frost-free period of 287 days a year. Although the 1.2 mu of land per person was small, the potential to be tapped was great. After in-depth research on the growth patterns of crops, they discovered many internal connections between crops. If they were reasonably combined and configured, they could transform mutual competition into mutual promotion. They used the favorable conditions of the people's commune being large in size and public in nature to vigorously reform some unreasonable farming systems left over from the past, and actively promoted effective intercropping and relay cropping experience. Last year alone, more than 20 intercropping and relay cropping methods were promoted on a large scale, including economic crops and food crops, tall-stem crops and creeping crops, early-maturing crops and late-maturing crops, leguminous crops and non-leguminous crops. As a result, the expected results were achieved: more varieties can be planted in places with little land; a variety of crops can be produced at high yields at the same time; and the uneven distribution of labor can be adjusted. Corn and sweet potatoes were interplanted in 7,000 mu of sweet potato fields, 1,300 mu of peanut fields, and tobacco fields. The growth of peanuts and tobacco was not affected, but an additional 100 to 200 jin of corn were harvested per mu. Sugarcane row spacing is wide, and a season of spring potatoes is added on the ridges in the sugarcane rows. During the growth of potatoes, sugarcane is mostly underground or in the seedling stage, and will not be hindered. When the potatoes grow to a depth of more than a foot and the ridges should be dug to fertilize the sugarcane, the sugarcane is already mature. Harvesting and digging the ridges to fertilize can be done in one fell swoop, and the leaves and stalks of the potatoes are used as fertilizer for the sugarcane on the spot, yielding more than 1,000 jin of potatoes per mu. Wheat, cotton, and sweet potatoes are the three crops with the largest area and the most conflicts, but after implementing wide-row intercropping, the three "enemies" reconciled and improved together. Wide-row intercropping is: when cultivating winter crops, plant wheat in one row and peas and early-maturing vegetables in another row; when cultivating spring crops, plant cotton in the row of early-maturing vegetables and peas, and plant sweet potatoes in the row of wheat. In this way, for cotton, it can be sown 30 to 40 days earlier than in the past, extending the growing period, and the ventilation and lighting conditions are particularly good; for wheat, intercropping with leguminous crops increases the planting density and reduces lodging; for sweet potatoes, the biggest benefit is timely planting. Last year, the result of implementing wide-row intercropping on 3,000 mu of land was an increase of 23% compared to full-soil cotton planting, an increase of 12% in wheat, and an increase in sweet potatoes as well.

    Last year, the area of land in Jiefang Commune where intercropping, relay cropping, and additional planting were implemented accounted for 42% of the total cultivated land area. As a result, the planting area of spring crops was expanded by nearly 7,000 mu, and the yield per unit area of most intercropped and relay-cropped crops was improved, which played a particularly prominent role in ensuring an increase in production throughout the year. Last year, the commune encountered severe drought and floods, but in addition to some reduction in sugarcane production, grain, cotton, and other crops still achieved an all-round bumper harvest, changing the historical shortage of grain in one fell swoop, and achieving self-sufficiency with a slight surplus for the first time after completing the state grain purchase task. The masses' evaluation of promoting intercropping and relay cropping is: "Now we've found the way!"

    Complete Sets, Evergreen in All Seasons

    The immediate results of promoting intercropping and relay cropping have added a hundredfold confidence and strength to the cadres and commune members of the entire commune. In order to further promote intercropping and relay cropping, the Commune Party Committee, after summarizing past experiences last autumn, promptly proposed new measures and new requirements: to make the crops complete sets, to be evergreen in all seasons, and to bring grain and cotton to a new level.

    The so-called complete set refers to, based on effective experience, respectively taking several major crops as the head, looking ahead and behind, and finding the most appropriate combination of various crops in a two-year rotation cycle. This year, the commune has five major complete sets:

    (1) Sweet Potato-Rice Dragon: Dry land, winter crops are wheat or rapeseed, spring crops are sweet potatoes intercropped with corn, with beans around; paddy fields, double-season rice plus one season of winter crops. (2) Cotton Dragon: Winter crops, wheat wide-row intercropped with peas and broad beans, with a season of early-maturing vegetables added between the rows of peas and broad beans; spring crops, cotton wide-row intercropped with sweet potatoes or peanuts, with corn intercropped between the rows of sweet potatoes and peanuts. (3) Sugarcane Dragon: Newly planted sugarcane, add a season of green manure or vegetables in the early stage, and intercrop a season of spring potatoes between the rows after planting; winter sugarcane intercrop a season of wheat, and then add a season of potatoes. (4) Garden Dragon: In orchards and mulberry gardens, winter crops are broad beans and peas, and spring crops are sweet potatoes, beans, or medicinal materials. (5) Vegetable Dragon: Plant corn between the rows of pumpkins, cowpeas, etc., and plant autumn potatoes in the middle of cucumbers, achieving four to five crops a year.

    Implementing complete sets of crops is to bring forth the new and gradually establish a new rotation system suitable for large-scale commune production, effectively strengthening the planning and foresight of large-scale promotion of intercropping and relay cropping. Although the commune has a large variety of crops, when arranging production, grasping these five dragons will bring order to the chaos, making the cadres and commune members clear in their minds, and they can see from the last season to the next season, from this year to next year and even the year after.

    The power of Jiefang Commune's implementation of complete sets of crops, vigorously carrying out intercropping, relay cropping, and additional planting, has begun to manifest itself in this year's agricultural production. Winter crops have eliminated idle land, achieving full planting; the sown area of spring economic crops has increased by 10% compared to last year, and the sown area of food crops has increased by 18.3%. 70% of the commune's cultivated land has been increased from two crops a year to five crops in two years and three crops a year. The entire landscape of the fields has changed, and crops grow continuously throughout the year. In spring, peas and broad beans are still flowering and fruiting, and cotton is planted between their rows; when wheat begins to ripen, peas and broad beans are harvested, and the lush green cotton seedlings have already covered the earth; after the wheat is harvested, sweet potatoes and corn are immediately planted; before the sweet potatoes are harvested, peas and broad beans are planted in their empty rows; and on the land where sweet potatoes have been dug up, another season of autumn vegetables will be added; as soon as the cotton stalks are pulled out, wheat is planted immediately...

    It is no longer difficult to hear people complain that 1.2 mu of land per person is too little. On the contrary, everyone believes that these lands have not been fully used. After the winter harvest this year, the historical spring and summer famine was eliminated. After completing the state procurement task, the commune members' rations were arranged until August, and pig feed, seed grain, and reserve grain were also implemented in the fields and warehouses. Everyone is in a happy mood and has more energy. While focusing on spring grain production, they are also focusing on field management of economic crops.

    Grasp Three Links
    Complete sets of crops and large-scale intercropping and relay cropping are a major change in the farming system. Every step of its progress is full of ideological struggles between advanced and conservative, so it is necessary to strengthen Party leadership and do a good job in political and ideological work. In addition, according to Jiefang Commune's experience, it is also necessary to grasp the following three links:

    Grasp planning: Matching various crops into complete sets and promoting them on tens of thousands of mu of land is a very meticulous and complex task. It is dangerous to have no plan or to have a poorly planned one. As the farmers say: If you mess it up for one year, you won't be able to straighten it out in two years. The key to good planning lies in the leadership going deep into reality and mobilizing the masses. When arranging the production plan for 1960, the Party Committee Secretary and members all went to the fields to work, personally made three pilots, figured out the rules, and then promoted them in an all-round way. The commune also organized eighty planning teams, and more than 1,600 cadres, technicians, and old farmers directly participated in the planning. After formulating a preliminary plan, it was submitted to all commune members for discussion. The vast number of commune members put forward more than 14,000 suggestions, enriching and practicalizing the content of the plan.

    Grasp labor: Maintaining sufficient labor in the front line of agricultural production and using it reasonably is the central issue in doing a good job in large-scale intercropping and relay cropping. Jiefang Commune's method of grasping labor is: the labor on the agricultural front line should always account for 75% of the total labor, of which 85% is fixed in the production team. When carrying out rush harvesting and planting and other assault farm work, the production teams uniformly transfer workers and use them in a concentrated manner. Usually, work groups are established to divide the work and manage various intercropped and relay-cropped crops.

    Grasp fertilizer: Intercropping and relay cropping increases the multiple cropping index and expands the planting area, so it is necessary to correspondingly increase more and better fertilizer. Jiefang Commune used the favorable conditions of increased grain and feed after promoting intercropping and relay cropping to focus on raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer. At the same time, they focused on local chemical fertilizers and large-scale accumulation of natural fertilizers. The number of local chemical fertilizer plants in the commune has increased from ten last year to forty-one, and this year's production has increased fivefold compared to the same period last year. This year's green manure is also accumulated more.

    利用有限的耕地生产更多粮食
    ——简阳县解放公社大面积推行间作套种的经验
    本报记者　刘宗棠
    四川简阳县解放公社平均每人一亩二分一厘土地，而以棉花为主的经济作物每年种植面积占去了一半多。长期以来，生产上存在一个难题：经济作物与粮食作物争土地、争时间、争劳力。
    在这种情况下，大多数地区仍然沿用着小农经济的作法，常常是牺牲一种作物来满足另一种作物。如为了使大春经济作物早种和轮作，就大量压缩小春粮食种植面积，每年小春休闲地多达二、三万亩。这样，粮食生产上升速度缓慢，公社化以前社员口粮历年要靠国家供应；棉花生产也由于粮食生产经常拉后腿，产量起伏不定。
    “这下可找到门路了”
    1958年10月公社成立后，在党中央“以粮为纲、全面发展”的方针指导下，地委、县委结合当地情况又作出“抓住重点（粮食）、突出特点（棉花）”的指示。公社党委明确了奋斗方向，鼓足干劲，响亮地提出了“棉花要当红旗手、粮食不做伸手派”的保证，领导全体社员，苦干实干，决心夺取粮食、经济作物双丰收。
    干部和群众齐心合力，从这个社具体条件出发，寻找粮棉同时高速度发展的办法。这里没有什么荒地可开，但气候比较温和，一年无霜期长达二百八十七天，每人一亩二分土地虽少，可挖的潜力却很大。经过深入研究作物生长规律，摸索到许多作物间的内在联系，如果把它们加以合理的组合配置，就可以变相互竞争为相互促进。他们运用人民公社一大二公的有利条件，大力改革过去遗留下来的一些不合理的耕作制度，积极推行行之有效的间作套种经验。去年一年，在较大面积上推行的间作套种达二十多项，有经济作物与粮食作物、高秆作物与匍匐作物、早熟作物与迟熟作物、豆类作物与非豆类作物等各种各样的间作套种。这样做的结果，收到了预期的效果：在土地少的地方也能多种；多种多样的作物同时都能高产；劳力忙闲不均的情况可以调节。全社有七千亩红薯、一千三百亩花生和烤烟田里间种了玉米、红薯，花生和烤烟的生长没有受到什么影响，每亩地却多收了一、二百斤玉米。甘蔗行距宽，在甘蔗行子中的埂上增种一季春洋芋。洋芋生长期间，甘蔗大部时间是在土内或幼苗期，不会受到妨碍。等到洋芋长到一尺多深应该挖埂壅蔸施肥时，甘蔗已经成熟，收获与挖埂壅蔸一举两得，洋芋的叶、秆就地作了甘蔗的肥料，每亩多收一千多斤洋芋。小麦、棉花、红薯是三宗面积最大，也是矛盾最多的作物，但实行宽厢套种后，三个“冤家”和解，并且共同提高。宽厢套种是：栽培小春作物时，一厢种小麦，一厢种豌豆和早熟蔬菜；栽培大春作物时，早熟蔬菜和豌豆厢种棉花，小麦厢种红薯。这样，对棉花说，比过去能提前三、四十天下种，延长了生长期，并且通风透光条件特别好；对小麦说，它和豆类作物套种，密植程度增加，倒伏现象减少；对红薯来说，最大的好处是栽种及时。去年在三千亩土地上实行宽厢套种的结果，比满土净种棉花增产23％，小麦增产12％，红薯也有提高。
    解放公社去年推行间作、套种、增种的土地，占耕地总面积42％，大春作物由此而扩大种植面积近七千亩，大多数间作套种作物的单位面积产量都有所提高，这对保证全年增产起了特别突出的作用。去年这个社曾遇到严重的旱灾和洪灾，但除甘蔗有些减产外，粮食、棉花和其它作物仍然获得全面丰收，一举改变了历年缺粮面貌，第一次在完成国家公粮任务后做到自给而稍有余。群众对推行间作套种的评价是：“这下可找到门路了。”
    配套成龙，四季常青
    推行间作套种收到的立竿见影的成绩，给全社干部和社员增添了百倍信心和力量。公社党委为了进一步推行间作套种，去年秋后在总结过去经验的基础上，及时提出新的措施和新的要求：把作物配套成龙，要四季常青，粮食、棉花更上一层楼。
    所谓配套成龙，就是根据行之有效的经验，分别以几项主要作物为首，瞻前顾后，找出各种作物在两年一个轮作周转期中最恰当的配成组合。这个社今年已经配套成龙的有五大条：
    （1）红薯水稻龙：旱地，小春作物种小麦或油菜，大春作物红薯间作玉米，周围带豆子；水田，双季稻加一季小春。（2）棉花龙：小春作物，小麦宽厢套种豌豆、蚕豆，豌豆、蚕豆行间增种一季早熟蔬菜；大春作物棉花宽厢套种红薯或花生，红薯和花生行间间作玉米。（3）甘蔗龙：新植蔗，前期增种一季绿肥或蔬菜，种植后行间套种一季春洋芋，冬植蔗套种一季小麦，再增种一季洋芋。（4）园林龙：果园、桑园中，小春作物种蚕豆、豌豆，大春作物种红薯、豆类或药材。（5）蔬菜龙：在南瓜、豇豆等行间带种玉米，黄瓜中间带种秋洋芋，做到一年四至五熟。
    实行作物配套成龙，就是推陈出新，逐步建立起一种适应公社大生产的新的轮作体系，有效地加强了大面积推行间作套种的计划性和预见性。尽管这个社作物种类较多，但在安排生产时，抓住这五条龙就纲举目张，条理分明，使干部、社员心中有数，可以从上季看到下季，从今年看到明年甚至后年。
    解放公社实行作物配套成龙，大搞间作套种增种的威力，在今年农业生产上已开始显现出来。小春消灭了空闲土地，做到全种；大春经济作物播种面积比去年扩大10％，粮食作物扩大18.3％。全社70％的耕地由一年两熟提高为两年五熟和一年三熟。整个田野的面貌都改观了，一年四季作物生长不间断。春天，豌豆、蚕豆还在开花结荚，棉花就在它们的行间穿林下种；等到小麦开始黄熟，豌豆、蚕豆收完，绿油油的棉苗已经复盖了大地；小麦收过之后，紧接着就把红薯和玉米栽种下去；不等红薯收获，豌豆、蚕豆又在它们的空行间种下；在红薯挖过的土地上，还要增种一季秋菜；棉花刚一拔秆，麦子跟着下地……。
    再难听到人们抱怨每人一亩二分地太少的话了，相反的大家都认为就这些土地还没有充分使用。今年小春收获后，消除了历史性的春荒夏荒。在完成国家征购任务后，社员口粮安排到8月中，猪饲料粮、种子粮、储备粮等也都落实到场、到仓。人人心情舒畅，干劲更足了，他们在狠抓大春粮食生产同时，也狠抓经济作物田间管理。
        抓住三个环节
    作物配套成龙，大搞间作套种，是耕作制度的大变革，它的每一步进展都充满着先进与保守的思想斗争，因此必须加强党的领导，作好政治思想工作。除此之外，根据解放公社的体会，还需要抓好以下三个环节：
    抓规划：各种各样的作物配套成龙，在好几万亩土地上推行，是一件非常细致而又复杂的工作，没有规划或规划得不好，都是危险的。正如农民所说的：一年搞拐了，两年拉不伸。作好规划的关键，在于领导深入实际，发动群众。解放公社在安排1960年的生产规划时，党委书记和委员全部出动，到田间办公，亲自作出三个试点，摸出规律，再全面推广。全社还组织了八十个规划小组，直接参加规划的干部、技术员、老农有一千六百多人。在制定出初步方案后，又交全体社员讨论，广大社员提出一万四千多条建议，使规划内容丰富、切实。
    抓劳力：农业生产上保持充足的劳力并合理加以使用，是搞好大面积间作套种的中心问题。解放公社抓劳力的办法是：农业第一线的劳力经常要占总劳力75％，其中85％固定在生产小队。各生产队在进行抢收抢种等突击性的农活时，统一调工、集中使用，平时成立作业小组，分工管理各种间作套种作物。
    抓肥料：间作套种增加了复种指数，扩大了种植面积，因此需要相应地增加更多更好的肥料。解放公社利用推行间作套种后粮食和饲料增加的有利条件，狠抓养猪积肥。同时大抓土化肥和大积自然肥。全社土化肥厂由去年的十个发展到四十一个，今年生产量比去年同期增加了五倍。今年的青草肥也积得多。
