    Remembrance and Blessing
    Zeng Ruihua
    During festivals, one thinks of loved ones all the more. As the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea on "August 15th" arrives, I, a veteran of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who once fought and lived in Korea, cannot help but deeply miss that heroic nation and its heroic people. I especially remember the scenes where I received a second life there, as if it were only yesterday... On February 3, 1958, in Korea, several of us soldiers were sent by our superiors to a forest area to haul timber. It was already dark, and the comrades had gone to cook, but I was lying on the warm floor of an elderly Korean woman's house to rest because of stomach pain. Unexpectedly, the stomach pain intensified in waves, like a knife twisting, and my face changed color. The old woman noticed and quickly dropped what she was doing, ran over, used her hand to feel my forehead, brought a new quilt to cover me, and asked her son to find our team leader. After a while, the liaison officer from the team arrived. As soon as I finished telling the liaison officer about my condition, the old woman eagerly asked the liaison officer to translate it for her. What to do when someone is sick? This place was neither a city, nor were there any hospitals nearby. It was getting darker and darker, and my stomach pain was getting worse and worse. The old woman asked the liaison officer to stop passing cars on the highway, preparing to send me to the Yeonthan County Hospital (equivalent to a Chinese county). The old woman sat by my side, touching my forehead and pulling the quilt over me. From her uneasy face, it could be seen that my illness worried her as if it were her own son's illness.
    The liaison officer waited until 11 o'clock at night before encountering a Korean transport truck full of wooden boards. According to regulations, no one else could ride in the truck, but when the two Korean drivers heard that it was to send a sick soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, they unhesitatingly helped me into the truck, let me lie flat on the wooden boards, and took off their coats to spread and cover me, afraid that I would get cold. The truck sped towards Yeonthan County, arriving at the hospital at one o'clock in the morning. The two drivers helped me into the hospital, and the nurse on duty woke the director from his deep sleep. The director, an old doctor with gray hair, had not yet buttoned his clothes and immediately picked up his stethoscope to examine me. As a result, it was found that I had acute appendicitis and needed surgery. For greater safety, the kind old director comforted me, first gave me medicine and an injection, hastily wrote a letter of introduction of my condition, and instructed the liaison officer to quickly send me to Sariwon Central Hospital for surgery.
    Fortunately, the transport truck was still outside, the drivers waiting because they were worried. But the truck was not going to Sariwon, and it was ninety kilometers from Yeonthan to Sariwon. At this time, the two drivers discussed it and unhesitatingly unloaded the wooden boards, deciding to drive me to Sariwon specifically. The car sped along, only hearing the whistling of the wind. I knew that the two Korean comrades were trying to speed up as much as possible to save my life. Arriving at Sariwon Central Hospital at three o'clock in the morning, the liaison officer got out of the car to complete the admission procedures, and the Korean driver comrades carried me into the hospital like brothers. Several doctors were awakened from their deep sleep and immediately performed a fluoroscopy consultation for me, and soon carried me into the operating room...
    The next day, when I woke up and opened my eyes, I found myself lying in a comfortable ward. A Korean nurse with a kind smile walked over and greeted me in Chinese, saying that the hospital had assigned her and another nurse to take care of me. Several doctors would come to my bed to check on me many times day and night. For six consecutive days, when I woke up and opened my eyes, it was either nurse Li Yunshun watching over me or nurse Jin Yinggan sitting by my bed. A week later, my incision had basically healed. Thinking of the unnamed old woman, the two drivers, the kind old director, and the doctors and nurses who were as close as siblings, I really wanted to go back to the army immediately and answer them with my actual work. But the doctor would not let me leave the hospital yet. They found that I did not eat much after the stitches were removed, so they rushed to consult and found that there were many roundworms in my stomach, and gave me medicine to kill the worms. They said, "We must be responsible for the health of a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the end."
    Under the rescue and care of the Korean doctors and nurses, and under the warmth of internationalist love, my body was completely healthy. When it came time to leave the hospital on the 24th, we were reluctant to part with each other. To be honest, I rarely shed tears in my life, but this time I could not help but be moved to tears, turning my head step by step to say goodbye to them...
    It has been two years since I returned to the motherland. Whenever I see my healthy body and happily complete one task after another, the faces of the kind Korean people immediately appear before my eyes. My dear motherland gave me my first life, and heroic Korea gave me my second life.

    怀念和祝福

    每逢佳节倍思亲，当“八·一五”朝鲜解放十五周年纪念日来到的时候，我这个曾经战斗和生活在朝鲜的志愿军战士，不能不深深地思念起英雄的国家、英雄的人民来。尤其难忘的是我在那里获得第二次生命的那些情景，仿佛才是昨天的事……1958年2月3日，在朝鲜，我们几个战士被上级派往一个林区去拉木料。天已经黑了，同志们煮饭去了，我因为肚痛躺在一位朝鲜老大娘的热炕上休息。谁知肚痛一阵阵加剧，像刀绞似的，脸色也变了。老大娘发觉后，连忙丢下手里的活计跑过来，用手探我的头，把新被子拿来盖在我身上，又叫她儿子去找我们带队的人。一会带队的联络员跟着来了。我刚向联络员讲完病况，老大娘就急着要联络员翻译给她听。人病了，怎么办呢？这地方既不是城市，附近也没有医院，天越来越黑，我肚痛也越来越厉害。老大娘叫联络员到公路上去截过路汽车，准备把我送到延滩郡（等于中国的县）医院去。老大娘坐在我身边，一会摸摸我额头，一会给我拉拉被子。从她那不安的面容里可以看出，我得病就像她自己儿子得病一样使她担忧焦急。
    联络员等到深夜十一点，才遇上一辆满载木板的朝鲜运输车。按规定车上是不能再乘人了，但两位朝鲜司机听说是送一位志愿军病号，就毫不犹豫地把我扶上车，让我平躺在木板上；怕我冻着，又把他们穿着的大衣脱下来，给我铺上盖上。汽车飞似地朝延滩郡奔去，到医院已是午夜一点。两位司机把我扶进医院，值班护士把院长从酣睡中叫起来。院长是一位头发斑白的老医生，衣服还没有扣起，马上拿起听诊器就给我看病。结果查明我患急性盲肠炎，需要割治。为更加安全，慈祥的老院长安慰着我，先给我服药打针，急忙写了病情介绍信，嘱咐联络员赶快把我送到沙里院中央医院去动手术。
    正好运输汽车还在外面，司机因为不放心，一直在等着。但汽车并不去沙里院，而且从延滩到沙里院有九十公里。这时两位司机一商量，毫不犹豫地就把木板卸下，决定轻车专门送我去沙里院。汽车飞一般地驰行，只听见呼呼的风响。我知道，两位朝鲜同志为了拯救我的生命在尽量加快车速。到达沙里院中央医院已是深夜三点，联络员下车办入院手续，朝鲜司机同志亲兄弟般把我背进医院。几位医生从酣睡中被叫起来，马上为我进行透视会诊，不一会就把我抬进了手术室……。
    第二天我醒来一睁眼，发现自己躺在舒适的病房里。一位笑容可掬的朝鲜女护士，走过来用中国话向我问好，说院里指定她和另一位女护士来护理我。几位医生白天夜晚总要到我床前来检查好多次。一连六天，我醒来睁眼时，不是护士李云顺守着我，就是护士金英干坐在我床边。一个星期以后，我的刀口基本上好了。想起不知姓名的老太太、两位司机、慈祥的老院长、亲如手足的医生护士，我真想马上回到部队去，以自己的实际工作来回答他们。可是大夫还不让我出院，他们发现我拆线后吃东西总不多，又赶忙进行会诊，查明是肚里蛔虫多，又给我服药打虫。他们说：“我们对一个志愿军的健康要负责到底。”
    在朝鲜医生和护士同志的抢救护理下，在国际主义的爱的温暖下，我的身体完全健康了。当24日出院那天，我们依依不舍，都不忍分离。说老实话，我一生难得流泪，但这次我禁不住热泪盈眶，一步一回头地告别了他们……
    回到祖国已经两年了。每当我看到自己健康的身体，愉快地完成一个又一个任务，在我眼前立刻浮现一张张亲切的朝鲜人民的脸容来。亲爱的祖国给了我第一次生命，英雄的朝鲜给了我第二次生命。
