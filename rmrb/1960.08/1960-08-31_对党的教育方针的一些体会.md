Some Experiences with the Party's Education Policy
Liu Shikun

I am a student at the Central Conservatory of Music. During the great education revolution, based on my personal experience, I have gained some superficial understanding of the Party's education policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor.

Since the education revolution, all teachers and students of our Central Conservatory of Music have gradually and clearly realized that the entire process of music education should be a process of adhering to the ideological transformation of music workers; the entire process of music education should also be a process of adhering to the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.

In the past, piano performers often had the idea that piano performance art is only technical, and piano performers only need to concentrate on the training of their hands and fingers for years to achieve a highly soft and sharp sense of feeling in order to obtain and maintain everything. Therefore, labor training and piano performance seemed to never be related, and they even superstitiously believed that they could not even lift heavy boxes, let alone participate in industrial and agricultural production labor. Secondly, due to the one-sided emphasis on the technicality of piano performance art, they even cited bourgeois piano artists as examples, arguing that although they had a stubborn bourgeois worldview, it did not prevent them from becoming excellent pianists, believing that pianists do not need to have a proletarian worldview. Thirdly, there is a large amount of European piano music literature, and it has been highly developed. Only by mastering these large amounts of literature can piano workers master the art of piano, so it is difficult for piano art to adhere to the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. These erroneous ideas have been spread and circulated among our piano students for a long time, and have long been considered unquestionable.

In the summer of 1958, I returned to China after participating in the Tchaikovsky Piano Competition. Although I had only been away from the motherland for eight months, everything was undergoing profound and tremendous changes in that era, which was equal to twenty years. The country's face was developing rapidly with each passing day, and new people and new things emerged one after another, which greatly encouraged me. Through participating in the voluntary labor of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, I received my first education in productive labor. After returning to school, it was the time when the whole people were vigorously developing iron and steel. In order to learn technology, we went to steel factories to learn skills and had preliminary contact with worker comrades. After personally participating in steelmaking, our minds gradually broadened, and we felt that if we could contribute a little to the "1070," it would be our greatest happiness. Last spring, we also participated in the rectification movement of the Yongfeng People's Commune. All of these were courses that our piano students had never taken before.

Through participating in productive labor, I received a vivid class education. First of all, I realized the noble and excellent qualities of the working people, and they did not care about rewards for their labor. But when I recalled my labor at the reservoir, I worked hard for an afternoon and paved a small piece of land, and I felt quite proud, thinking that I had achieved a lot! Compared with the qualities of the working people, the distance is too far. In the contact with worker comrades during the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking, I initially realized that participating in productive labor can not only create material wealth, but also transform the spiritual world. Participating in the rectification of the commune in the countryside, I truly understood why some people say that the commune is very good, while others say it is very bad, and why the vast majority of people say that the commune is a red flag, while a few people are calling for the past being better than the present. This gave me the most vivid class education.

In the past, when I played the piano, I often thought about technique and the audience's reaction. Every time I performed, I would be nervous before going on stage: "What will the audience's reaction be to this performance? Will it be a sensation or a flop after the performance?" There was an invisible gap between the stage and the audience, and there was no emotional exchange with the audience, and the technique was often discounted. After labor training and contact with the working people, I not only knew in theory but also in thought and emotion that music must serve the working people. The school party committee organized us to perform in teahouses, factories, cinemas, and troops, which made me truly realize the importance of my performance work. I gradually felt that although the performers on the stage and the audience off the stage were different, they were all fighting for the same goal. When I thought that my music was serving this common sacred goal, I no longer considered technique and personal gains and losses when playing the piano, so I could be full of emotion and expression, and I also had a correct understanding and expression of music; the masses believed that my performance had significantly improved in the understanding of the content of the music.

However, I and several of my classmates were not satisfied with just engaging in performance activities. We hoped to create a work that expresses the spirit of Chinese youth in the Great Leap Forward to enrich our performance repertoire. Because, although we need to play the works of Bach, Mozart, and Liszt, it always feels somewhat insufficient for both the audience and the performers to only play these during the Great Leap Forward. Therefore, several of us had the desire to create the "Youth Piano Concerto." In the "Youth Piano Concerto," we enthusiastically praised the revolutionary heroism of the youth in the Great Leap Forward who are full of energy and move forward bravely, and expressed the youth's sincere feelings of love for the Party and Chairman Mao and their firm belief and yearning for a better future.

In the performances and creations, the masses gave us the greatest encouragement and support. Many people wrote letters to us. One worker said: "I didn't like listening to piano music in the past, and I didn't know what you were doing on the stage, but after listening to your performance, I liked it very much. I felt that I suddenly understood it, I felt that listening to the piano was very kind, very exciting, and also very good. Now you bring the performance to our door, and after listening to your performance, our production enthusiasm is even higher. I hope you will perform more in the future, and I will definitely make more outstanding achievements in production." A Liberation Army comrade wrote in a letter:
"In the past, I always thought that the piano was something that had nothing to do with us, but after listening to your performance of the "Youth Piano Concerto," I was reminded of the years in Yan'an, which gave me a new force of encouragement."

From my personal experience, participating in productive labor will not only not hinder my work, but will also enable me to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers to a certain extent, understand their thoughts and feelings, and obtain correct performance and creation methods; especially when playing modern works, only by having a certain understanding of the thoughts and feelings of the masses can I have a correct understanding of the music and express it well.

Through productive labor and participating in the revolutionary struggle of the people, I can not only transform my worldview, but also transform my artistic view on this basis, and incorporate the musical art, which was previously regarded as a personal career, into the correct direction—the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers—to obtain the true source of artistic creation. In the past, in such a narrow school life environment, my thoughts and feelings were trapped in my personal circle, and I pursued that mysterious "inspiration" and "musical sense" in the piano room, and the music always lacked sufficient internal emotion, and playing the piano was regarded as a bitter chore. After contacting the working masses in labor, their heroic images deeply educated me and encouraged me, and often appeared vividly before my eyes. I always felt a surge of emotion in my heart. To talk about "inspiration" and "musical sense," only by going deep into the working masses and in the struggle life of the masses can I find true "inspiration" and "musical sense."

Our task of ideological transformation is far from complete. We must adhere to labor training, go to factories, go to the countryside, and go deep into the revolutionary struggle of the people to continue to strengthen the transformation of thoughts and feelings.

In the school's academic criticism movement, some people cited the fact that the first prize winner of the Tchaikovsky Piano Competition was the American Cliburn, attempting to show that piano performance does not necessarily need the guidance of a correct worldview; and they cited the fact that the top prizes of recent international competitions are often won by competitors from capitalist countries as examples of the above theory, implying that the musical performance level of capitalist countries has already surpassed our socialist countries. I think this statement is incorrect. First of all, just as American athletes may win first place in the Olympic Games, this is not enough to show that the sports level of the United States is advanced, but can only prove that they have trained individual athletes under the domination of championshipism. Secondly, and most fundamentally, the standard of art also has class nature. In my opinion, the artistic standard of bourgeois piano performance is only technicalism, and the one-sided pursuit of strength and speed, whoever plays louder and faster is good. Therefore, the common characteristic of the players from capitalist countries in recent international competitions is that they all have a certain technical level. However, this purely technical playing method can at best be used to perform the works of bourgeois composers, and even when playing the works of bourgeois composers, they often greatly distort the content of these works according to the needs and aesthetic views of their own class. Please see, when bourgeois pianists play Chopin's music, they use the flashy style that Chopin himself opposed to please the tastes of the bourgeois audience. As for bourgeois pianists, they have made many jokes when playing the works of socialist composers. The American pianist Cliburn mentioned above, when he played a dance tune by a Soviet composer, doubled the speed and the content was incomprehensible. Isn't this enough to illustrate the problem! Therefore, the fallacy that piano performance does not necessarily need the guidance of a correct worldview will inevitably fall into the quagmire of revisionism and be unable to extricate itself.

These are some of my experiences on the road to self-transformation. However, in the future, I am determined to continuously improve my ideological awareness under the leadership of the Party, follow the path guided by Chairman Mao, and resolutely carry out the thorough self-transformation of "changing from one class to another" to become a red and expert literary and art worker of the working class.

    对党的教育方针的一些体会
    刘诗昆
    我是中央音乐学院的一个学生。在伟大的教育革命中，根据我个人的经历，使我对教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合的党的教育方针有了一些粗浅的体会。
    教育革命以来，我们中央音乐学院全体师生，逐步明确地认识到，整个音乐教育的过程，应该是一个坚持音乐工作者思想改造的过程；整个音乐教育的过程，也应该是坚持文艺的工农兵方向的过程。
    从前，钢琴演奏者常有这样的思想：钢琴这种表演艺术只具有技艺性，钢琴演奏者只要长年累月地集中于两手和手指锻炼，使手指达到高度的柔软和锐敏的感觉，就可以获得一切，保持一切了。因而，劳动锻炼和钢琴演奏好像是从来不会发生什么关系的，甚至迷信到连重的箱子都不能提的地步，更不要谈参加工农业生产劳动了。其次，由于片面的强调钢琴表演艺术的技艺性，甚至举出资产阶级的钢琴艺术家，虽然具有顽强的资产阶级世界观，但也没有妨碍他们成为优秀的钢琴家来作为例证，认为钢琴家可以不必具备无产阶级的世界观。第三，欧洲的钢琴音乐文献非常之多，并且得到高度的发展，钢琴工作者只有掌握这些大量的文献，才可能掌握钢琴艺术，因此，钢琴艺术要坚持工农兵的方向是有困难的。这些错误思想，曾经长期地在我们学钢琴的学生中散播、流传，并且长期地被认为这是无可怀疑的。
    1958年夏天，我参加柴可夫斯基钢琴比赛后回国，离开祖国虽然才八个月，但在那一天等于二十年的年代里，一切都起着深刻而巨大的变化，国家的面貌日新月异地飞跃发展，新人新事层出不穷，使我受到极大的鼓舞。通过参加十三陵水库的义务劳动，我初次接受了生产劳动的教育。回到学校以后，正是全民大办钢铁的时候，为了学习技术，我们到钢厂去学本领，和工人同志有了初步的接触；在自己亲自参加炼钢以后，我们的心胸逐渐开阔了，感觉到自己能为“一零七零”贡献一点力量的话，那将是我们最大的幸福。去年春天，我们又参加了永丰人民公社的整社运动。所有这些，对我们钢琴学生说来，都是从来没有上过的课程。
    通过参加生产劳动，使我受了一次生动的阶级教育。首先使我体会到劳动人民高贵的、优秀的品质，对劳动并不计较报酬。但回想我在水库劳动时，卖劲儿干了一个下午，铺出了小小的一块地方，心中就颇为得意，认为成绩不小呀！和劳动人民这种品质相比，相距是太远了。在大炼钢铁时和工人同志的接触中，我初步认识到参加生产劳动不仅能够创造物质财富，而且能够改造精神世界。在农村中参加整社，才真正弄清为什么同是公社，有人说好得很，又有人说糟得很，为什么绝大多数的人说公社是红旗，又有少数人在叫今不如昔。这使我受了一次最生动的阶级教育。
    过去我演奏钢琴，经常想到的是技术，是听众的反应。每次演奏，还没上台心里就先打了鼓：“这次演奏，听众会有什么反应呢？弹完以后是一鸣惊人还是名落千丈呢？”台上台下隔着一条无形的沟，和听众感情不能交流，在技术上也往往打折扣。经过劳动锻炼，和劳动人民的接触，才不仅从理论上而且从思想情感上知道了音乐必须为劳动人民服务的道理。学校党委组织我们到茶馆、工厂、电影院、部队去演出，这才使我真正了解到我的演奏工作的重要意义，逐渐感觉到台上的演奏者和台下的听众虽然不同，但是都在为同一个目标奋斗着。当想到我的音乐是为这个共同的神圣目标而服务时，演奏钢琴就不再去考虑技术和个人的得失了，因而能够感情充沛而洋溢，对音乐也有了正确的理解和表现；群众认为我的演奏在对音乐内容的理解上有了显著的提高。
    但是，我和我的几个同学，不满足于我们仅仅只搞演出活动，我们希望能创作一首表现大跃进中中国青年的精神面貌的作品，来充实我们的演奏曲目。因为，我们固然需要演奏巴哈、莫扎特、李斯特的作品，但在大跃进时为群众仅仅演奏这些，无论是听众和演奏者都总觉得有些不够满足。因此，我们几个人就产生了创作《青年钢琴协奏曲》的愿望。在《青年钢琴协奏曲》中，我们满腔热情地歌颂了大跃进中青年们干劲冲天、勇往直前的革命英雄主义精神，表现了青年们热爱党、热爱毛主席的诚挚的感情和对美好未来的坚定的信念和向往。
    在演出和创作中，群众给了我们最大的鼓舞和支持。许多人给我们来信，有个工人说：“钢琴这玩意儿，我过去就不爱听，也不知道你们在台上闹什么玩意儿，可是听了你们演奏的，我非常喜欢它，我觉得我忽然听得懂了，我觉得听钢琴很亲切，很带劲，也很好听。现在你们把演出送上门，我们听了你们的演出，生产热情更高了，希望你们以后多演，我一定在生产上作出更出色的成绩来。”一个解放军同志来信写道：
  “过去我总以为钢琴和我们是不相干的东西，可是听了你们演奏的《青年钢琴协奏曲》，我就想起在延安的年月，给了我一种新的鼓舞力量。”
    从我个人这些亲身的经历来看，参加生产劳动不仅不会妨碍业务，反而由于能和工农兵达到一定程度的结合，体会到他们的思想情感，使我获得了正确的演奏和创作方法；特别是演奏现代曲目时，只有对群众的思想感情有一定的了解，才有可能对音乐作出正确的理解，并且很好地将它表达出来。
    通过生产劳动和参加人民群众的革命斗争，不仅可以改造自己的世界观，而且在这个基础上改造了自己的艺术观，把过去作为个人事业的音乐艺术纳入正确的方向——为工农兵服务的方向，获得艺术创造的真正源泉。过去在那样狭隘的学校生活环境中，思想感情陷在个人的圈子里，关在琴房里追求那种玄而又玄的“灵感”、“音乐感”，音乐上总缺乏充沛的内在感情，把弹琴看成苦差。在劳动中接触了工农群众以后，他们的英雄形象深深地教育了我，鼓励了我，常常活跃在我的眼前，我总觉得有一股子情感在内心冲动，在心中沸腾。要说“灵感”、“音乐感”，只有深入工农群众，在群众的斗争生活中，才会找到真正的“灵感”、“音乐感”。
    我们的思想改造的任务，还远远没有完成，我们必须坚持劳动锻炼，下厂、下乡、深入到人民群众的革命斗争中，继续加强思想感情的改造。
    在学校的学术批判运动中，曾有人举出柴可夫斯基钢琴比赛第一奖获得者是美国人克里本这一件事，企图说明钢琴演奏并不必要有正确的世界观作为指导；并且举出最近几次国际比赛的高等奖常为资本主义国家的比赛者获得这一事实来作为上述理论的例证，言下之意，好像资本主义国家的音乐演奏水平已经高过我们社会主义国家似的。我觉得这种说法是不正确的。首先，正像奥林匹克运动会上可能有美国选手取得第一一样，这不足以说明美国的体育水平是先进的，只能证明他们在锦标主义的支配下训练出来了个别的运动员而已。其次，也是最根本的，就是艺术标准也是有阶级性的。据我看来，资产阶级的钢琴演奏的艺术标准就是唯技术主义，片面追求力度和速度，谁弹的响谁弹的快便是好的。所以，最近几次国际比赛的资本主义国家的选手的共同特点便是都具有一定的技术水平。但是，这种唯技术主义的弹奏方法，充其量也只能用以表演资产阶级作曲家的作品，而且就在弹奏资产阶级作曲家的作品时，也常是根据其本阶级的需要、审美观……，而对这些作品的内容作了极大的歪曲。请看，资产阶级的钢琴家弹奏萧邦的音乐时，便是应用萧邦本人最反对的华而不实的风格来取悦于资产阶级听众的喜好的。至于资产阶级钢琴家在演奏社会主义国家作曲家的作品时，便闹了不少笑话。上面所说的那个美国钢琴家克里本，他弹奏苏联作曲家的一个舞曲时，速度加快了一倍，内容更是不知所云，这还不足以说明问题么！所以，什么钢琴表演不必要正确的世界观作为指导的谬论，再进一步便一定会陷入修正主义的泥坑而不能自拔了。
    这是我在自我改造的道路上的一点体会。但是，今后我有决心在党的领导下，沿着毛主席指引的道路，不断提高思想觉悟，坚决进行“由一个阶级变到另一个阶级”的脱胎换骨的自我改造，做一个又红又专的工人阶级的文艺工作者。
