Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th - The Guangzhou branch of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and figures from the fisheries industries of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City jointly held a mass rally in Guangzhou on the 19th to welcome the visiting Japanese Fishery Workers Delegation.

    Bai Yunpeng, a leading figure in Guangdong's fisheries, spoke at the rally. On behalf of all fishermen and fishery workers in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, he extended heartfelt congratulations and a warm welcome to the Japanese fishery workers who have actively participated in the anti-American patriotic struggle and made great contributions. He said that fishermen of both countries have a strong desire for friendly cooperation, but U.S. imperialism's establishment of military bases throughout Japan not only constitutes an invasion of Japan but also threatens peace in China and Asia. Therefore, driving U.S. imperialism out of Japan and Asia has become the common task of the Chinese and Japanese people. He said that the Chinese and Japanese people should unite closely, wage a resolute struggle, and shatter all the conspiracies and tricks of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

    Kasahara Chizuru, head of the Japanese Fishery Workers Delegation, also spoke at the meeting. He expressed gratitude for the warm welcome the delegation received from the Chinese people during their visit to China and for the support of the Chinese people for the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle. He emphasized that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Japanese and Chinese people, and the friendship between the Japanese and Chinese people is based on the common struggle against U.S. imperialism. He expressed that they will continue to resolutely fight against the anti-China and anti-Japanese reactionaries who undermine Sino-Japanese friendly relations in the future, and promote the early realization of the desire for friendly cooperation between Chinese and Japanese fishermen fishing peacefully in the ocean.

    The Japanese Fishery Workers Delegation arrived in Guangzhou on the 15th from Wuhan for a friendly visit. During their stay in Guangzhou, the delegation visited Guangzhou's revolutionary historical sites and visited people's communes in Zhongshan County and Shunde County.

    The delegation concluded its visit to Guangzhou on the 20th and returned home via Shenzhen. On the eve of the delegation's departure from Guangzhou, the Guangzhou branch of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries held a farewell banquet.

    宾主一致强调中日人民在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中加强团结
    据新华社广州20日电　中国人民对外文化协会广州分会和广东省、广州市渔业界人士19日在广州联合举行群众集会，欢迎来广州访问的日本渔业工人代表团。
    广东省渔业方面负责人白云鹏在会上讲话。他代表广东省广州市全体渔民和渔业工人向积极参加反美爱国斗争并作了很大贡献的日本渔业工人致以衷心的祝贺和热烈的欢迎。他说，我们两国渔民都有着友好合作的热烈愿望，但美帝国主义在日本遍设军事基地，这不仅是侵略日本，而且威胁着中国和亚洲的和平，因此，把美帝国主义赶出日本和亚洲，已成为中日两国人民的共同任务。他说，中日两国人民应该紧密团结起来，进行坚决的斗争，粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的一切阴谋诡计。
    日本渔业工人代表团团长笠原千鹤也在会上讲了话。他对代表团在访问中国期间受到中国人民的热烈欢迎，和中国人民对日本人民反美爱国斗争的支持，表示感谢。他强调指出，美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人，日中两国人民的友谊是建立在共同反对美帝国主义的斗争的基础上的。他表示今后将继续坚决与破坏日中友好关系的日美反动派进行斗争，促使日中两国渔民在和平的海洋上友好合作捕鱼的愿望早日实现。
    日本渔业工人代表团是本月15日从武汉来广州进行友好访问的。代表团在广州期间，参观了广州的革命史迹，访问了中山县和顺德县的人民公社。
    代表团已于20日结束在广州的访问，取道深圳回国。在代表团离开广州的前夕，中国人民对外文化协会广州分会，曾经举行宴会欢送。
