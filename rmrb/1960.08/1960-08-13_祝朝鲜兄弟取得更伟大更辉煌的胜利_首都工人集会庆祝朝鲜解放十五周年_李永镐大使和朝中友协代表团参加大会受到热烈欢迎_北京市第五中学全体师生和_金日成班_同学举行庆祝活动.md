Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Today, Beijing workers and Beijing No. 5 Middle School, home to the ten-year-old "Kim Il-sung Class," held celebrations for the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

    Korean Ambassador to China, Lee Young-ho, and the delegation of the Korea-China Friendship Association, headed by Kim Jong-heng, participated in the celebration attended by more than 1,500 workers.

    At the Beijing workers' celebration, Wang Jiong, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, spoke first. On behalf of the Beijing workers, he congratulated the heroic and fraternal Korean people and the Korean working class on the festival, and praised the Korean people's great contribution to opposing U.S. imperialism and defending world peace. He said that since the Korean armistice, under the leadership of the Korean Labor Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people have rapidly healed the wounds of war, embarked on the Chollima, and advanced along the beautiful road of socialist construction. We cheer for the brilliant achievements made by the Korean people, and sincerely wish the Korean people and worker brothers greater and more glorious victories in the cause of socialist construction.

    Wang Jiong said that we, the Beijing workers and the entire Chinese people, firmly support the Korean people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. U.S. imperialism's clinging to South Korea has left Korea in a state of division, and the South Korean people live a life of darkness. This shows that the aggressive and warlike nature of U.S. imperialism will never change. He firmly believes that the Korean people, who once defeated the American wolves, will surely drive out U.S. imperialism and realize the peaceful reunification of Korea. The thirty million heroic Korean people will surely reunite in a prosperous and happy family.

    Wang Jiong concluded by saying that the people of China and Korea are as closely related as lips and teeth, and the friendship forged in blood between the people of China and Korea is higher than mountains and deeper than the sea. The Korean people's festival is also our festival. Let us unite closely in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, forever hold high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism, and strive together to accelerate the socialist construction of our two countries and constantly strike at the American aggressors!

    Kim Jong-heng, head of the delegation of the Korea-China Friendship Association, spoke in warm applause, introducing the glorious construction achievements of Korea in the fifteen years since liberation, and enthusiastically praised the victory of China's Great Leap Forward. He said: "The traditional friendly relations between the people of Korea and China cannot be destroyed by any force. Our friendship flows endlessly like the Yalu River. Even if the sea were used as ink, it would not be enough to write about it."

    Kim Jong-heng said that recently, the people of Beijing and all parts of China have supported the South Korean people's struggle against U.S. imperialist colonial rule, greatly encouraging the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and severely打击(dǎjī - hit/strike) our common enemy, the U.S. imperialist robbers. Kim Jong-heng's speech was warmly welcomed by the audience.

    Lang Hongxi, a former volunteer soldier and representative of the advanced collective of Beijing, a worker from the Comprehensive Instrument Factory, also spoke at the meeting.

    Among those who participated in the Beijing workers' celebration were Lao She, Vice President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, Zhu Yujin, Director, and Peng Siming, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions.

    After the meeting, Beijing workers' amateur art groups performed cultural programs for the conference.

    Tonight, more than 1,500 teachers, students and staff of Beijing No. 5 Middle School happily beat gongs and drums, welcoming the delegation of the Korea-China Friendship Association headed by Kim Jong-heng and Ma Dongshan, Counselor of the Korean Embassy in China, who came to participate in the celebration.

    The distinguished guests first came to the Kim Il-sung Class and met the students of the Kim Il-sung Class. The distinguished guests entered the classroom and saw the special issue "Achievements of Korean Cultural and Educational Undertakings in the Past 15 Years" published by the students to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea. The classroom also displayed the students' academic achievements and gifts such as letters, books and pictorials from Korean friends. Many certificates and flags were hung around the classroom, which marked the excellent achievements students have made in political ideology, study, labor, and health in the past ten years. During the meeting with the students, Han Cinan, Director of the First Bureau of the Korean Foreign Culture Committee and a member of the delegation, presented the students with gifts such as Korean pictorials, porcelain, and commemorative badges.

    At the celebration, Lu Qinghuan, Principal of Beijing No. 5 Middle School, on behalf of more than 2,000 teachers, students and staff, extended festive greetings to the distinguished guests and through the distinguished guests to the Korean people, and introduced the glorious achievements of Korea in the fifteen years since liberation. She said that every achievement made by the Korean people encourages the Chinese people, and the Chinese people are as happy as they are for their own achievements.

    Han Xiudong, a member of the delegation of the Korea-China Friendship Association, warmly congratulated everyone at the meeting and encouraged all students and Young Pioneers to study hard and become socialist and communist builders who are both red and expert, and comprehensively developed, and to be good children of Chairman Mao.

    Shi Dinghuan, the student representative of the Kim Il-sung Class, introduced to the distinguished guests the learning and living conditions of this class in the past ten years, as well as their close ties with the "Mao Zedong Young Pioneers" of the Pyongyang Mudan High School in Korea.
    After the meeting, a cultural program was performed, and the students performed Korean songs such as the Battle Song of the Korean People's Army. (Attached photo)

    朝鲜驻我国大使李永镐和以金钟恒为首的朝中友协代表团，参加了一千五百多工人举行的庆祝会。
    在北京工人的庆祝会上，北京市总工会主席王炯首先讲话。他代表北京市工人向英雄的、兄弟的朝鲜人民和朝鲜工人阶级祝贺节日，并且赞扬朝鲜人民在反对美帝国主义，保卫世界和平中的巨大贡献。他说，朝鲜停战以后，朝鲜人民在劳动党和金日成同志的领导下，迅速医治了战争的创伤，跨上千里马，沿着美好的社会主义建设大道前进。我们为朝鲜人民所取得的辉煌成就而欢呼，并且衷心预祝朝鲜人民和工人兄弟在社会主义建设事业中取得更伟大、更辉煌的胜利。
    王炯说，我们北京工人和全中国人民一样，坚决支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的正义斗争。美帝国主义赖在南朝鲜，使朝鲜处于分裂状态，使南朝鲜人民过着暗无天日的生活。这表明了：美帝国主义的侵略和好战本性是绝不会改变的。他坚信，曾经击败美国野心狼的朝鲜人民，一定能够把美帝国主义赶出去，实现朝鲜的和平统一。三千万英雄的朝鲜人民一定会团聚在繁荣幸福的大家庭里。
    王炯最后说，我们中朝两国人民唇齿相依，休戚相关，中朝两国人民以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊比山还高，比海还深。朝鲜人民的节日也就是我们的节日。让我们紧密地团结在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭里，永远高举马克思列宁主义的红旗，为加速我们两国社会主义建设，不断打击美国侵略者而共同奋斗！
    朝中友好协会代表团团长金钟恒在热烈的掌声中讲话，他向大家介绍了朝鲜解放十五年来辉煌的建设成就，并热情地赞扬了我国大跃进的胜利。他说：“朝中两国人民传统的友好关系是任何力量不能破坏的，我们的友谊像鸭绿江水一样长流不息，把海水当成墨汁也是写不完的。”
    金钟恒说，最近北京和全中国各地的人民支援南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义殖民统治的斗争，大大鼓舞了朝鲜人民为和平统一祖国的斗争，狠狠地打击了我们的共同敌人——美帝国主义强盗。金钟恒的讲话受到全场热烈的欢迎。
    前志愿军战士、北京市先进集体代表——综合仪器厂的工人郎洪喜也在会上讲了话。
