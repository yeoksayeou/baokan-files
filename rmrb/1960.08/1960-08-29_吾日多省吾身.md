	"I Daily Examine Myself"
	Zhang Sisheng
	Confucius' disciple Zeng Shen said, "I examine myself three times daily." This spirit of using self-reflection to check one's own shortcomings is worth emulating by us.

	We are currently in a great era where one day equals twenty years, advancing by leaps and bounds while holding high the three red flags; we shoulder the heavy responsibility of completely changing our country's "poor and blank" face and building our country into a strong socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. In order to accomplish this heavy responsibility that benefits future generations, each of us must constantly and strictly demand and examine ourselves; therefore, each of us might as well adopt "I daily examine myself."

	First of all, we can check ourselves every day to see whether we have well implemented the tasks assigned by the Party and the motherland. In our work, have we followed the mass line? Do we have the communist style of "stepping forward when facing difficulties, yielding when facing honor" and "leaving difficulties to ourselves and giving convenience to others"? Have we armed ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and have we played the role of a promoter in various movements? … In addition, we can also examine our lifestyle, ideological emotions, and so on.

	If we daily question our words and deeds more, and measure them more with the standard of communist thought, then we can shoulder the heavy responsibility entrusted to us by the Party and the motherland, the heavy responsibility of benefiting future generations.

### “吾日多省吾身”

    “吾日多省吾身”
    章思圣
    孔子的弟子曾参有“吾日三省吾身”之说。这种用反省来检查自己缺点的精神是值得我们效法的。
    我们正处于一天等于二十年的伟大时代，高举三面红旗飞跃前进；我们肩负着彻底改变我国“一穷二白”面貌，把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国的重任。为了完成这一造福于子孙万代重任，我们每个人就不能不时刻地、并严格地要求和检查自己；因而我们每个人不妨来个“吾日多省吾身”。
    首先，我们每天就可检查一下自己，对党和祖国交给的任务，是否已很好地贯彻执行了？在工作中，是否走了群众路线？是否有“见困难就上，见荣誉就让”和“把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人”的共产主义风格？是否以毛泽东思想武装了自己，在各项运动中是否都起了促进派的作用？……此外，我们还可检查一下自己的生活作风、思想情绪，等等。
    我们每日多对自己的言行，多打几个问号，多用共产主义思想标准尺度去衡量一下，我们才能担当得起党和祖国交给我们的重任，造福于子孙万代的重任。
