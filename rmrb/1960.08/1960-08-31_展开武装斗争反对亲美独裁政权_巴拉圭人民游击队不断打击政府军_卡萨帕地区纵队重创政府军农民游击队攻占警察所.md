　　Xinhua News Agency, Asuncion, 30th -- News from Asuncion: Anti-dictatorial guerrillas active throughout Paraguay are constantly striking the dictatorial army.

　　According to the fourth and fifth communiques recently issued by the Joint Armed Leadership Committee of the Paraguayan National Liberation United Front, a guerrilla unit operating in the Kaguazu region, 250 kilometers southeast of Asuncion, successfully carried out combat. In the Casapa region, another anti-dictatorial force called the Itororo Detachment recently engaged in continuous battles with government troops, inflicting significant losses on the government forces. The dictatorial army attempted to encircle and attack this detachment, but the guerrillas cleverly struck the government troops from the flanks, causing heavy casualties. Prior to this, another guerrilla unit attacked Mbuyapey, occupied the local police station, and seized a radio transmitter and many weapons. Another peasant guerrilla unit attacked Barreiro Grande, only 70 kilometers from the capital. The guerrillas captured the local police station at no cost, seizing a radio transmitter and a large amount of ammunition. News reports say that in addition to the above-mentioned areas, anti-dictatorial guerrillas are currently active in Olqueta in northern Paraguay, the area between the Parana River and the Paraguay River in the south, Sapukai in the center of the Paraguayan railway, and the Cordillera region.

　　According to reports, the morale of the government troops is declining daily under the blows of the guerrillas. In a government force commanded by General Colman, many people have been killed or deserted. Officers and soldiers are increasingly opposed to the suppression of peasants and prisoners. Commander Colman, in order to suppress the soldiers' discontent, ordered the execution of sixteen soldiers and two officers in July. But this further aroused the soldiers' dissatisfaction, and they demanded the trial of Colman. The dictatorial government and the ruling National Republican Party's attempt to organize a "National Republican Party Militia" to suppress the guerrillas has also failed. Although the dictatorial regime used money to buy people off, farmers belonging to the National Republican Party refused to participate.

　　News also said that many wounded government soldiers were transported to the Asuncion Military Hospital. In order to prevent the people from understanding the true situation of the anti-dictatorial armed struggle, the wounded were secretly sent to the military hospital at night. In order to cover up their defeats, the government has ordered that the wounded on the battlefield be directly transported to the hospital by plane.

　　However, propaganda posters reporting on guerrilla activities frequently appear on the walls of buildings in the capital, Asuncion.

　　The "Voice of the Paraguayan Central Revolution" radio station, in its broadcast on July 23, called on all anti-dictatorial forces to unite and raise the banner of land reform.

　　Paraguayan students have also actively launched an anti-dictatorial struggle. The Paraguayan University Student Union convened a grand anti-dictatorial rally of students nationwide on July 23. On May 14, Paraguay's National Day, college and middle school students held rallies and demonstrations against the dictatorship, demanding the lifting of martial law, the release of political prisoners, and the cessation of persecution and terror.

　　Faced with increasingly fierce resistance, the Paraguayan dictatorial regime is relying on U.S. support to maintain its unstable rule. In a letter written to Eisenhower in June, the Central Leadership Committee of the Paraguayan National Liberation United Front condemned the United States for its financial, military, and diplomatic support to the dictatorial regime. The letter revealed that U.S. military personnel control the economic, financial, and military decision-making power in Paraguay and are building jet airports in Paraguay. The letter emphasized that despite U.S. support, the Paraguayan people are determined to overthrow the hated dictatorial regime.

    卡萨帕地区纵队重创政府军农民游击队攻占警察所
    新华社30日讯　亚松森消息：活跃在巴拉圭各地的反独裁游击队不断地打击独裁军。
    据巴拉圭民族解放联合阵线联合武装领导委员会最近发表的第四号和第五号公报，在亚松森东南二百五十公里的卡瓜苏地区活动的一支游击队成功地进行了战斗。在卡萨帕地区，另一支名叫伊托罗罗纵队的反独裁军在不久前连续同政府军进行了战斗，使政府军遭到重大损失。独裁军企图包围和袭击这支纵队，但游击队机智地从侧面打击政府军，使它遭到大量伤亡。在这以前，另外一支游击队还袭击了姆布亚佩，占领了当地的警察所，缴获了一部无线电发报机和许多武器。还有一支农民游击队袭击了距首都只七十公里的巴雷罗格兰德，游击队以无一伤亡的代价曾攻下当地的警察所，并缴获了无线电发报机和许多军火。消息说，除了上述地区以外，目前在巴拉圭北部的奥尔克塔、南部巴拉纳河和巴拉圭河中间地带、巴拉圭铁路中心萨普凯以及科尔迪列拉等地区都有反对独裁政府的游击队在积极活动。
    据报道，在游击队的打击下，政府军的士气日益消沉。在由科耳曼将军指挥的一支政府部队中，许多人被击毙和开了小差，军官和士兵日益反对镇压农民和俘虏。指挥官科耳曼为了镇压士兵的不满曾经在7月间命令枪毙了十六名士兵和两名军官。但这更加激起了士兵的不满，他们要求审判科耳曼。独裁政府和执政的国家共和党企图组织“国家共和党民兵”用来镇压游击队的阴谋也遭到了失败，尽管独裁政权用金钱进行收买，但是属于国家共和党的农民拒绝参加。
    消息还说，政府军的许多伤员运到了亚松森军医院，为了使人民不了解反独裁武装斗争的真实情况，伤员是在黑夜偷偷地被送进军医院的。政府为了掩饰败迹，已经下令把战场上的伤员直接用飞机送到医院去。
    但是，在首都亚松森的建筑物的墙上，经常出现报道游击队活动情况的宣传画。
    “巴拉圭中部革命之声”电台在7月23日的广播中，号召所有反独裁的力量团结起来，举起进行土地改革的旗帜。
    巴拉圭学生也积极地展开了反独裁斗争。巴拉圭大学生联合会在7月23日曾召集全国的学生举行了一次反独裁的盛大集会。在5月14日巴拉圭国庆节这一天，大中学生举行了反对独裁的集会和示威游行，他们要求解除戒严状态，释放政治犯，停止迫害和恐怖活动。
    巴拉圭独裁政权由于面临日益剧烈的反抗，正借助于美国的支持来维持自己不稳的统治。巴拉圭民族解放联合阵线中央领导委员会在6月间写给艾森豪威尔的一封信中，曾谴责美国对独裁政权在财政上、军事上和外交上的支持。这封信揭露，美国的军事人员掌握着巴拉圭的经济、财政和军事的决定权，并正在巴拉圭建筑喷气飞机场。这封信强调说，尽管有美国的支持，巴拉圭人民决心推翻令人痛恨的独裁政权。
