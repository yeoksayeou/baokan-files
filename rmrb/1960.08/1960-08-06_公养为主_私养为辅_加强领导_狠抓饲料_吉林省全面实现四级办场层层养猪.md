Jilin Province had increased its total number of pigs by 31.5% by July 20, compared to the end of 1959. The sow herd has also expanded rapidly, increasing by 51.6% compared to the end of 1959, laying a good foundation for the high-speed development of pig raising.

The reason why Jilin Province's pig-raising industry has been able to achieve such outstanding results is, first and foremost, the conscientious implementation of the policy of "public raising as the mainstay and private raising as a supplement," which has mobilized the enthusiasm of all parties. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 43,448 pig farms in the province, including 5,405 farms run by state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms, government agencies, schools, and military units, 770 farms run by communes, 6,928 farms run by management districts, and 30,345 farms run by production teams. In addition, individual households raise pigs that account for 20.4% of the province's total number of pigs. Four-level farm management and five-level pig raising have been realized. According to unified planning, pig farms at all levels have implemented a reasonable division of labor. County-run pig farms focus on both cultivating superior breeds and fattening; commune pig farms focus on breeding improved breeds, supplemented by fattening; management district pig farms focus on breeding piglets, supplemented by fattening; and production team pig farms focus on fattening, supplemented by breeding. Government agencies and organizations mainly raise pigs for self-consumption, selling the surplus to the state.

In terms of running pig farms on a large scale, the practice of small-scale as the mainstay, supplemented by large and medium-sized farms, has been implemented. According to statistics, there are 33,204 small pig farms with fewer than 100 pigs in the province, accounting for 76.4% of the total number of farms in the province, and the number of pigs raised accounts for more than 80% of the province's total number of pigs. The advantages of small-scale farming are many: ① it can achieve unified planning and arrangement of feed and feeding; ② small scale means light infrastructure construction tasks, which is convenient for making use of local conditions and materials, saving manpower and material resources; ③ pig raising is adjacent to fields, which is convenient for accumulating and transporting manure; ④ it is conducive to epidemic prevention, and it is easy to treat outbreaks and prevent them from spreading further.

Another experience in developing pig raising at high speed is to vigorously grasp feed production. Based on the situation in Jilin, three aspects have been particularly emphasized: vigorously developing the utilization of agricultural and sideline products, universally establishing feed bases, and collecting large quantities of wild feed. In grasping feed, pig farms at all levels have adopted different methods according to the situation. Commune and management district pig farms mainly focus on planting feed, supplemented by collecting wild feed and utilizing agricultural by-products. Where conditions permit, they operate flour mills, oil presses, tofu workshops, and grain and rice processing plants, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in feed. Production team pig farms mainly focus on utilizing agricultural by-products, supplemented by planting and collection. Individual households mainly collect wild feed.

The universal implementation of the "four guarantees and one reward" system, which includes guaranteeing breeding, guaranteeing labor, guaranteeing consumption, and guaranteeing manure accumulation, has boosted the enthusiasm of the contracting units and breeders and is also an important experience in developing pig raising at high speed.

Another important reason why pig raising in Jilin Province was able to develop rapidly in the first half of the year is that the Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over this work. All localities have generally placed pig raising on the leadership's agenda, regularly studying, deploying, and inspecting it, and holding on-site meetings in a timely manner to summarize and exchange experiences.

    公养为主　私养为辅　加强领导　狠抓饲料
    吉林省全面实现四级办场层层养猪
    本报讯　吉林省到7月20日，全省猪的存栏数比1959年年末增加31.5％。母猪群也有了迅速扩大，比1959年年末增加51.6％，为高速度发展养猪事业打下了良好的基础。
    吉林省养猪事业所以能够取得这样优异的成绩，首先是认真地贯彻执行了“公养为主，私养为辅”的方针，调动了各方面的积极性。据目前不完全统计，全省有养猪场四万三千四百四十八处，其中国营农牧场、机关、学校、部队办养猪场五千四百零五处，公社办养猪场七百七十处，管理区养猪场六千九百二十八处，生产队办养猪场三万零三百四十五处。此外，社员个人养猪占全省养猪总头数的20.4％。实现了四级办场，五级养猪。按照统一规划，各级养猪场实行了合理分工。县办的养猪场是培育优良种猪和育肥并重；公社养猪场以繁殖良种为主，育肥为辅；管理区养猪场以繁殖仔猪为主，育肥为辅；生产队养猪场以育肥为主，繁殖为辅。机关、团体养猪主要是自食，多余的卖给国家。
    在大办养猪场方面，实行了以小型为主，大中型为辅。据统计，全省一百头以下的小型养猪场有三万三千二百零四处，占全省饲养场总数的76.4％，饲养猪数占全省养猪总数的80％以上。以小型为主的好处很多：①能做到饲养和饲料统一筹划和安排；②规模小基建任务轻，便于因陋就简，就地取材，节省人力物力；③养猪邻田，便于积肥送肥；④有利于防疫，发生疫情也容易治，不能更多的蔓延。
    高速度发展养猪事业的另一个经验是狠狠抓住饲料生产。根据吉林情况，突出地抓住了三个方面：大搞农副产品利用，普遍建立饲料基地，大量采集野生饲料。在抓饲料中，各级养猪场都根据情况分别采取了不同的办法。公社、管理区养猪场以种植饲料为主，采集野生饲料和利用农业副产物为辅，有条件的办粉房、油房、豆腐房和粮米加工厂，力争做到饲料自给。生产队养猪场以利用农业副产物为主，种植、采集为辅。社员个人养猪主要是以采集野生饲料为主。
    普遍推行包繁殖、包工、包消耗、包积肥的“四包一奖”制度，鼓舞各包产单位和饲养人员的积极性，也是高速度发展养猪事业的一条重要经验。
    吉林省上半年养猪事业所以能够发展的快，还有一项更重要的原因，就是各级党委加强了对这一工作的领导。各地普遍把养猪事业提到领导议事日程上来，定期研究、布置和检查，及时召开现场会议，总结与交流经验。
