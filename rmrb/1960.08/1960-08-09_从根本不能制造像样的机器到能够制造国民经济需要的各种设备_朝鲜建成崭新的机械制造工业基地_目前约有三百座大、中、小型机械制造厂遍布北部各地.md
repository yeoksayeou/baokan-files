Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 8th: Our correspondent reports that the Korean people, in the fifteen years since liberation, have built a brand new mechanical manufacturing industrial sector from scratch.

Before liberation, due to the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism, North Korea's mechanical manufacturing industry accounted for only 1.6% of the total industrial output, almost equivalent to a blank slate. It was fundamentally unable to manufacture any decent machines, and all the equipment needed domestically had to be imported from abroad.

After liberation, especially after the end of the war against American imperialist aggression, the Korean people, with the assistance of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, built their own mechanical industrial base, newly constructing the Huichon Machine Tool Factory, Kuson Machine Tool Factory, Kuson Mining Machinery Factory, Huichon Precision Machinery Factory, Unsan Tool Factory, Kiyang Machinery Factory, Tokchon Automobile Factory and other new mechanical factories, and greatly expanded the original Bukjung, Rakwon, Ryongsong and other mechanical factories. To date, northern North Korea has a total of approximately three hundred large, medium, and small mechanical manufacturing plants. By 1959, the output value of the mechanical manufacturing industry accounted for 20.6% of the total industrial output value. At the time of liberation, northern North Korea had only two hundred and eighty metal cutting machine tools in total. Today, each of the nine provinces of northern North Korea has more than five hundred machine tools. Before liberation, North Korea could not manufacture machine tools itself. Today, it has laid the foundation for an annual output of three thousand machine tools.

In the Chollima Movement, North Korea's mechanical manufacturing industry has developed even more rapidly. Workers in the mechanical industry sector responded to the call of the Korean Workers' Party, daring to think and act, breaking the mystique of technology, and manufacturing tractors, trucks, excavators, electric locomotives, and large rolling mill equipment that were previously considered impossible to manufacture in North Korea, bringing North Korea's mechanical manufacturing industry into a new stage.

In 1959, the Korean Workers' Party put forward the slogan "Steel and machinery are the kings of industry," and called on all places with machine tools (from machine tool factories to machine repair shops with only one machine tool) to widely launch a movement to produce machine tools with machine tools. In the six or seven months from May to the end of last year, relying on the creativity of the masses and widely tapped potential, a total of 13,000 machine tools and simple machine tools were produced outside the national plan, equivalent to thirteen times the machine tool output of northern North Korea in 1958.

Due to the development of this movement, the technical foundation of the mechanical manufacturing industry has been further strengthened, the production of mechanical equipment and parts has been expanded, and the needs of the rapidly developing industrial production have been guaranteed. Major enterprises have expanded machine repair shops and manufactured large quantities of equipment and parts through this movement, ensuring the needs of production development. In addition, one hundred and forty agricultural machinery manufacturing plants have been newly built using the machine tools and simple machine tools produced in this movement. These industries have produced a large number of agricultural machines since this year, which has played a great role in promoting the rapid realization of agricultural mechanization. In addition, forty provincial-run comprehensive machinery factories have been newly built to manufacture large quantities of mechanical equipment and gradually equip the two thousand local industrial factories that have been newly built in the past two years.

Of particular importance is that this movement has further promoted the creative spirit of the workers and strengthened their confidence in self-reliance and self-manufacture of various mechanical equipment. The workers of the Ryongsong Machinery Factory, in this movement last year, self-made a vertical lathe weighing three hundred tons, consisting of nine thousand nine hundred parts, and eight meters high, which is a good example.

Today, "Chollima" tractors and "Victory 58" trucks, manufactured themselves, are running in the fields of North Korea, and self-manufactured machine fishing boats are sailing on the sea. In the mines, miners use rock drills, air compressors, and dozens of tons of grinding machines; in steel plants, the complete set of equipment for the newly restored blast furnace is also manufactured by North Korea itself. Now the Korean people have proudly announced that various equipment needed by various economic sectors can be manufactured by themselves. (Attached picture)

### 从根本不能制造像样的机器到能够制造国民经济需要的各种设备  朝鲜建成崭新的机械制造工业基地  目前约有三百座大、中、小型机械制造厂遍布北部各地

    从根本不能制造像样的机器到能够制造国民经济需要的各种设备
    朝鲜建成崭新的机械制造工业基地
    目前约有三百座大、中、小型机械制造厂遍布北部各地
    新华社平壤8日电　本社记者报道，朝鲜人民在解放后十五年来，从头建设起一个崭新的机械制造工业部门。
    在解放以前，由于日本帝国主义的殖民统治，朝鲜的机械制造工业在工业总产值中只占1.6％，几乎等于空白，根本不能制造什么像样的机器，国内需要的一切设备都要依靠从国外进口。
    解放后特别是在反对美帝国主义侵略的战争结束后，朝鲜人民在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的援助下，建设起了自己的机械工业基地，新建了熙川机床厂、龟城机床厂、龟城矿山机械厂、熙川精密机械厂、云山工具厂、岐阳机械厂、德川汽车工厂等新的机械厂，并大大扩建了原有的北中、乐元、龙城等机械厂。到目前为止，朝鲜北部已共有约三百座大、中、小型机械制造厂。到1959年，机械制造工业的产值在工业总产值中已占到20.6％。在刚解放时朝鲜北部总共才有二百八十台金属切削机床，今天朝鲜北部九个道，每个道都有五百台以上的机床。解放前朝鲜不能自己制造机床，今天已经打下了年产三千台机床的基础。
    在千里马运动中，朝鲜的机械制造工业更有飞跃的发展，机械工业部门的工人响应朝鲜劳动党的号召，敢想敢干，打破对技术的神秘观点，制造出了过去被认为在朝鲜不能制造的拖拉机、载重汽车、掘土机、电气机车和大型的轧钢设备等，使朝鲜的机械制造工业进入了一个新的阶段。
    1959年，朝鲜劳动党提出了“钢铁和机械是工业之王”的口号，并号召所有有机床的地方（大到机床厂、小到只有一台机床的机器修理车间），广泛展开机床生产机床的运动。在从去年5月到去年年底的六、七个月的期间内，依靠群众的创造性和广泛挖掘出来的潜力，在国家计划以外共生产了一万三千台机床和简易机床，这等于1958年朝鲜北部机床产量的十三倍。
    由于这一运动的开展，进一步加强了机械制造业的技术基础，扩大了机械设备和零件的生产，保证了飞跃发展着的工业生产的需要。各大企业通过这一运动扩大了机器修理车间，制造了大批设备和零件，保证了生产发展的需要。另外用在这一运动中生产出来的机床和简易机床新建了一百四十个农业机械制造厂，这些工业今年以来生产了大量的农业机械，对促进农业机械化迅速实现起了很大的作用。此外，还新建了四十个道营综合机械厂，制造大量的机械设备，逐渐把在近两年内新建起来的两千个地方工业工厂装备起来。
    特别重要的是，通过这一运动进一步发扬了工人们的创造精神，加强了他们自力更生、自己制造各种机械设备的信心。龙城机械厂的职工去年在这一运动中自造了重三百吨、由九千九百个零件组成的、高八米的立式车床，就是很好的例证。
    今天，在朝鲜的田野上奔跑着自己制造的“千里马号”拖拉机、“胜利五八型”载重汽车，在海洋上行驶着自己制造的机器渔轮。在矿山里，矿工们使用的凿岩机、空气压缩机和几十吨重的磨矿机；在钢铁厂里新恢复起来的高炉的全套设备，也都是朝鲜自己制造的。现在朝鲜人民已经骄傲地宣布：各经济部门需要的各种设备都能自己制造了。（附图片）
