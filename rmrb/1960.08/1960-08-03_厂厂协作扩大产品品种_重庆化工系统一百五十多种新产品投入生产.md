Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 2nd: Chongqing's chemical system is breaking down barriers between factories and engaging in large-scale collaborative production of new varieties. In the first half of the year, the city saw 154 newly added major products put into mass production, and 1,171 new products were successfully trial-produced.

A major measure taken by the Chongqing Chemical Bureau in its large-scale multi-variety production drive is to break down the boundaries between factories and organize all chemical plants to engage in large-scale collaborative and coordinated production. Based on the characteristics of chemical products, which require many raw materials, and the fact that one product often requires several or even dozens of raw materials, they organized collaborative coordination for raw material production on the one hand, and mobilized factories to cooperate with each other in technology and equipment on the other. This changed the past situation where the production of certain products in one factory was delayed due to difficulties in raw materials, equipment, and technology. This rapidly expanded the variety of products, allowing more than 150 newly added products to be put into mass production in the first half of this year.

In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials needed to increase the variety of products, the factories under the Municipal Chemical Bureau have set up more than 500 small, local chemical plants and assisted communes in setting up more than 400 chemical plants. In the first half of this year, these factories provided more than 15,000 tons of raw materials solely for the production of new products, with 133 major varieties. The Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory, thanks to setting up its own satellite factories, produced more than 280 kinds of pharmaceutical raw materials in the first half of the year. The proportion of self-produced pharmaceutical raw materials in the total consumption has increased from the original 30% to more than 77%. A large amount of self-produced raw materials has created conditions for expanding the variety of drugs. The variety of drugs produced by the factory in the first half of the year increased by more than one-third compared with last year. (Attached picture)

    厂厂协作扩大产品品种
    重庆化工系统一百五十多种新产品投入生产
    新华社重庆2日电　重庆市化工系统打破厂际界限，大搞协作生产新品种，上半年全市有一百五十四种新增加的主要产品大批投入生产，并且试制成功新产品一千一百七十一种。
    重庆市化工局在大搞多品种生产中采取的一项重大措施，就是打破厂际界限，组织各化工厂大搞协作配套生产。他们根据化工产品需要的原料多、一种产品往往要好几种甚至几十种原料的特点，一方面组织了原料生产的协作配套，一方面发动各厂在技术上、设备上互相协作。这样，就改变了过去一个厂生产某些产品因原料、设备技术等困难投入生产迟缓的状况，迅速扩大了产品品种，使一百五十多种新增加的产品都在今年上半年及时地大批投入生产。
    为了解决增加品种所需原料不足的困难，市化工局所属各厂自办了小土群化工厂五百多个，协助公社办了化工厂四百多个。这些工厂在今年上半年，单是为增加新产品生产的原料就有一万五千多吨，主要品种有一百三十三种。西南制药厂由于自己办起了卫星厂，上半年自产的药品原料就有二百八十多种，自产药品原料占全部用料的比例，已由原来的30％提高到77％以上。大量自产原料为扩大药品品种创造了条件，全厂上半年生产的药品品种比去年增加了三分之一以上。（附图片）
