Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th - Former Japanese Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi published an article in the "Asahi Shimbun" pointing out that the new Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda adheres to the Cold War policy, despite his superficial guarantees to change the new cabinet's foreign policy. In this article, published in the "Asahi Shimbun" on August 8th and 9th, Ishibashi said: "The Ikeda Cabinet talks glibly about peaceful coexistence, but takes no action to promote good-neighborly relations with socialist countries." The former Prime Minister said that in doing so, Ikeda is implementing the same policy as Nobusuke Kishi, who adopted a hostile attitude towards China.

Ishibashi pointed out that Japan should restore diplomatic relations with China as soon as possible. Ishibashi emphasized that the state of war still existing between the two countries should be ended through a peace treaty. He refuted the argument, based on the inappropriate prediction that China would collapse from within, that the restoration of diplomatic relations with China should be postponed indefinitely. Ishibashi also said that a false argument that should be shattered is that Japan should wait until China begs Japan to establish diplomatic relations on Japan's terms.

Ishibashi accused Ikeda of avoiding the hand of reconciliation extended by the Chinese people, who were generous enough to say that they would not take any retaliatory action against Japan for the atrocities committed by Japan during the war. Ishibashi criticized Ikeda's attitude towards China. He said, "All that the Ikeda Cabinet did for the Chinese delegation that visited Japan after a long interval was to allow the delegation to enter the country, and it is clear that Ikeda should have done more." Ishibashi said that Ikeda must think that Japan cannot adopt a neutral policy because Japan is a member of the "free world." Ishibashi warned that if Ikeda held this idea, Japan would virtually become like a state of the United States.

    日本前首相石桥湛山发表文章说
    日本应当尽速同中国复交
    指责池田对中国采取的态度
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本前首相石桥湛山在“朝日新闻”上发表文章指出：日本新首相池田勇人坚持冷战政策，尽管他表面上保证改变新内阁的外交政策。在8月8日和9日的“朝日新闻”上刊登的这篇文章中，石桥说：“池田内阁高谈和平共处，但是毫不采取任何行动来促进同社会主义国家的睦邻关系。”这位前首相说，池田这样做，是在执行同对中国采取敌视态度的岸信介相同的政策。
    石桥指出：日本应当尽速恢复同中国的外交关系。石桥强调说，仍然存在于两国之间的战争状态应当通过和约来加以结束。他驳斥了以不恰当地预料中国将从“内部崩溃”的看法为根据的这样一种论点：应当无限期地推迟恢复对华外交关系。石桥还说：应当粉碎的一种错误论点是，日本应当等待，直到中国恳求日本根据日本的条件建立外交关系。
    石桥指责说，池田避开了中国人民伸出的和解的手，中国人民十分宽大地说，他们并不考虑由于日本在战争时期所犯的暴行而对日本采取任何报复行动。石桥指责池田对中国的态度。他说，“池田内阁对经过长期的间隔后访问日本的中国代表团所做的，只是准许代表团入境，而事情很明显，池田本应做更多的事情。”石桥说：池田一定认为，日本不可能采取中立政策，理由是日本是“自由世界”的一员。石桥警告说，如果池田抱有这种想法，日本实际上将变成美国的一州的那样。
