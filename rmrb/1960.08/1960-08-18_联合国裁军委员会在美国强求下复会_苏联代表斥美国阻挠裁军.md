Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 17th: The UN Disarmament Commission held a meeting on the 16th at the insistence of the United States and its partners in the military bloc. The Disarmament Commission meeting was held despite the justified opposition of many national delegations. The purpose of the U.S. government in demanding the convening of the Disarmament Commission meeting is to confuse world public opinion and to conceal the intention of Western countries not to resolve the disarmament issue.

U.S. Representative Lodge first delivered a lengthy speech at the meeting, attempting to shift the blame for the failure of the Geneva Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee negotiations to the Soviet Union. Lodge said, "The Geneva negotiations were not successful, and the negotiations here, in the UN Disarmament Commission, and at the UN General Assembly next month will not be successful either." This shows that Western countries, especially the United States, do not intend to seriously resolve the disarmament issue.

Soviet Representative Kuznetzov, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, then spoke. He said that the process of disarmament negotiations clearly shows that the U.S. ruling circles always attempt to use their military power to deal with other countries from a position of strength, attempting to establish their control over the world.

Kuznetzov pointed out that the Soviet government spares no effort to strive for complete and thorough disarmament, but the United States and its military allies take the arms race as their policy, doing everything possible to obstruct the realization of disarmament. The clamor of the United States and its allies surrounding the convening of the UN Disarmament Commission is precisely to cover up the truth about their sabotage of disarmament negotiations.

    联合国裁军委员会在美国强求下复会
    苏联代表斥美国阻挠裁军
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国裁军委员会在美国及其军事集团伙伴的强求下于16日举行了会议。裁军委员会会议是在不顾许多国家代表团的有理由的反对下举行的。美国政府要求召开裁军委员会会议的目的在于迷惑世界舆论和掩饰西方国家不愿意解决裁军问题的意图。
    美国代表洛奇在会议上首先发表了冗长的演说，他企图把日内瓦十国裁军委员会谈判失败的罪责转嫁给苏联。洛奇说，“日内瓦谈判没有成功，在这里，在联合国裁军委员会以及在下月举行的联合国大会中的谈判也不会成功。”这表明，西方国家，特别是美国，不打算认真解决裁军问题。
    苏联代表、苏联外交部副部长库兹?佐夫接着发言。他说，裁军谈判的过程清楚地表明，美国统治集团总是企图利用自己的军事威力来从实力地位出发同其他国家打交道，企图建立他们对全世界的控制。
    库兹?佐夫指出，苏联政府不遗余力地争取全面彻底裁军，但是，美国和它的军事盟国却以军备竞赛作为自己的政策，竭尽全力阻挠实现裁军。美国和它的盟国的政府目前围绕着召开联合国裁军委员会的叫嚣，正是为了掩盖他们破坏裁军谈判的真相。
