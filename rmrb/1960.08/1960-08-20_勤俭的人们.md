Thrifty People

　　Careful Calculation in Grain Usage

　　Wang Daying, the production team leader of the Hongguang Tenth Team in the Cooperation Management Area of the Yudian People's Commune in Yingshan County, Hubei Province, is a good housekeeper who lives frugally. She not only takes the lead in saving grain but also frequently goes to the canteen, vegetable garden, and flour mill to help develop plans for saving grain.

　　After the wheat harvest, Wang Mama convened a family meeting with all eleven members, and everyone made a plan to save grain. In early June alone, they saved more than seven catties of flour. Under Wang Mama's influence, all one hundred-plus people in the canteen voluntarily made plans to save grain. In the past, the Fu Ben Shu family in the same courtyard didn't plan their grain consumption or make careful calculations. This time, Wang Mama helped them arrange their lives so that the fixed amount of grain was enough and there was even a surplus.

　　Wang Mama is very concerned about the work of the canteen and the flour mill, personally going to the canteen to assist the cooks in developing grain usage plans. When she discovered that the flour mill's flour yield was low, she worked with the workers to study and grind the wheat twice more, resulting in an additional four catties of flour per hundred catties of wheat. She also planted vegetables with the cooks, making the canteen's meals better and better. The commune members often say: "Wang Mama is really a good housekeeper."

　　Saving Cloth in Every Way

　　A certain artillery unit of the People's Liberation Army has consistently adhered to the glorious tradition of hard work and plain living. Under the slogan of "Everyone lends a hand, carefully calculates, cannons must be polished, cloth must be saved, and support national construction," they have saved public cotton cloth every year. In 1958, they saved 100% of the cloth used for wiping cannons, and from last year to now, they have saved another 86.6%.

　　The soldiers' cannons, like the workers' machines, need to be wiped frequently. But how can we wipe the cannons well and save cloth for the country at the same time? As early as 1958, the unit's Party committee specifically organized the soldiers to discuss this issue. After mobilizing the masses, calculating detailed accounts, and tapping potential, everyone believed that with the "old stock" from the past plus picking up some old cloth, they wouldn't even use it up in a year. Therefore, the Party committee decided not to request cannon-wiping cloth from higher authorities for a year, calling on everyone to "pick up cloth whenever they see it, and use every inch of cloth."

　　From then on, it became a common practice for officers and soldiers to pick up old cloth, picking it up wherever they went, even if it was only a small piece. The soldiers also put the dirty cloth from worn-out woolen sweaters, woolen trousers, vests, socks, and old cloth used for wiping cannons in the soil for two or three days to dissipate the grease and odor, then boiled it with alkaline water, washed it clean, sorted it for storage, sorted it for use, and frequently aired it to prevent mildew.

　　When the soldiers wipe the cannons, they classify and arrange the cannon-wiping cloth according to its newness, size, and use each piece to its full potential. The cloth used is washed and reused, some of it having been washed more than forty times. When using it, not an inch of cloth is thrown away; large pieces are used as small pieces, small pieces are used as cloth strips, and the cloth strips are bundled into brushes to wipe the surface dirt on large areas. Over the past few years, they have accumulated enough new cloth to last three years.

　　"The Iron Lock on the Granary Door"

　　"He is an iron lock on our granary door," people praised Comrade Yan Qingfu in this way.

　　Yan Qingfu is the financial secretary of the Weishi Brigade of the Zaoshi Commune in Shimen County, Hunan Province. He loves the commune as he loves his own home, and he is consistently frugal, economical, honest, and impartial. In the past two years, he has handled no less than four or five hundred transactions, large and small, all of which have original vouchers for verification, achieving consistency between accounts and assets. He lives a simple life and values public money more than anything else, not allowing even half a cent to be wasted, and not losing even a single blade of grass or tree.

　　Lao Yan can uphold the financial system for anyone, whether it is a leader or his own wife and children. Last year, a team cadre asked him to borrow twenty-odd yuan of public funds several times for personal matters, but Lao Yan refused, considering that the special funds should be used for their designated purpose.

　　In October last year, his eldest son, Fengchun, got married and needed some money. Some close relatives suggested to him: "The brigade's money passes through your hands anyway, it wouldn't matter if you temporarily moved some of it," but Comrade Yan Qingfu did not do this. Later, the Party branch secretary found out and quickly approved him to advance fifteen yuan so that he could hold the wedding for his son.

### 勤俭的人们

    勤俭的人们
    精打细算用口粮
    湖北省应山县余店人民公社合作管理区红光第十队生产队长汪大英，是一个勤俭过日子的好当家人。她不仅自己带头节约用粮，而且还经常深入到食堂、菜园和面粉加工厂，帮助制订节约用粮计划。
    麦子丰收后，汪妈妈召集全家大大小小十一人开了个家庭座谈会，个个订了节约用粮计划，6月上旬就节约了七斤多面粉。在汪妈妈的影响下，全食堂的一百多个人，都自动订了节约用粮计划。同院的傅本树家里，过去吃粮没有计划，不精打细算，这次汪妈妈帮助他家安排好了生活，使粮食按定量够吃有余。
    汪妈妈非常关心食堂和面粉加工厂的工作，亲自深入食堂协助炊事员订好用粮计划。她发现面粉加工厂出粉率低，就找工人一起研究，把小麦多磨两遍，结果每百斤小麦多出了四斤面粉。她还和炊事员一起种菜，使食堂的伙食越办越好。社员们常说：“汪妈妈真是个好当家人。”
    用布处处都节约
    人民解放军某炮兵分队，一贯坚持艰苦朴素的光荣传统，在“大家动手，精打细算，炮要擦亮，布要节省，支援国家建设”的口号下，年年节约公用棉布。1958年节约擦炮用布100％，去年到现在又节约了86.6％。
    战士的大炮和工人的机器一样，需要经常擦拭。但是怎样才能做到既把大炮擦好，又为国家节省布呢？早在1958年，部队党委专门组织战士们讨论了这个问题，经过发动群众，算细账，挖潜力，大家认为有过去的“老底子”再加上拣一些旧布，一年也用不完。于是，党委决定一年不向上级领擦炮布，号召大家“见布就拣，寸布必用”。
    从这以后，官兵们拣旧布就成为风气，走到哪里拣到哪里，哪怕是一小块布也要拣回来。战士们还把每年穿破了的绒衣、绒裤、背心、袜子等脏布和擦炮用过的旧布，先放在土里埋两三天，散发油腻和臭味，然后再用碱水煮过洗净，分类保管，分类使用，经常晾晒，防止发霉。
    战士们在擦炮的时候，按着擦炮布的新旧、大小，分类排队，各尽其用。所用过的布都是用了洗，洗了再用，有的布已经洗过四十次以上。用的时候是寸布不扔，大块用成小块，小块用成布条，布条再捆成刷子，用它擦拭大面的浮土。几年来，他们已经积存的新布三年也用不完。
    “仓门上的铁锁”
    “他是我们仓门上的一把铁锁”，人们这样称赞严清福同志。
    严清福，是湖南石门县皂市公社桅市大队的财经委员，他爱社如爱家，一贯勤俭节约，廉洁奉公。两年来，他经手的账目，大大小小不下四、五百笔，全部有原始凭单可查，做到了账实相符。他平日生活俭朴，把公家的钱财看得比什么都重，一分半文不让，一草一木不丢。
    老严对任何人都能坚持财经制度，不管是领导，还是自己的老婆孩子。去年，一个队干部因私事几次向他借二十来元公款，老严考虑到专款要专用，就婉言拒绝了。
    去年10月，他的大儿子奉春结婚，需要用些钱，个别至亲为他出主意：“大队里的钱横直是从你手里过，暂时挪用一点，有什么要紧”，可是严清福同志并没有这样作。后来党总支书记知道了，连忙批准他预支了十五元钱，才给儿子办了喜事。
