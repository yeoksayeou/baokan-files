Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 7th. Jilin Province is rushing to harvest spring wheat in the rain. According to statistics from July 30th, the province has already harvested 80,000 hectares of spring wheat.

This year, the planting area of spring wheat in Jilin Province has expanded by about a quarter compared to last year. Due to the implementation of winter sowing and strengthened field management by people's communes, this year's wheat has generally grown with thick stalks, large ears, and full grains. However, since the wheat generally matured and the harvest began, the weather has turned bad, with continuous rain. Under these circumstances, the broad masses of commune members have shown soaring enthusiasm and are rushing to harvest in the rain. Baicheng Prefecture, which plants the most wheat, has drawn out more than 80% of its labor force to rush the harvest under the command of harvest headquarters at all levels. By the end of July, the harvested area had reached more than 30%. In the past few days, party secretaries at all levels in the Siping area have personally gone to the fields to lead the wheat harvest and have organized people from non-wheat areas to provide support. In just two or three days, the entire area has rushed to harvest 61% of the wheat. During the rush harvest, the province also dispatched more than 2,200 harvesters of various types, greatly accelerating the progress of the wheat harvest.

During the rush harvest, all localities have paid special attention to the quality of the harvest, ensuring it is done well, managed well, and that no grains are lost. Tongyu County has set up wheat-picking checkpoints at every stage of cutting, bundling, stacking, and pulling, and has organized a total of 51,000 people to pick wheat. By July 27th, the county had picked up 34,951 jin of wheat ears.

People's communes in various localities have also adopted the "one-stop" method of cutting, pulling, picking, threshing, plowing, and replanting, achieving planting immediately after harvesting. In the wheat harvest in the Siping area, more than 4,800 specialized groups for planting autumn vegetables and forage crops were organized to rush replanting. In the Changchun area, more than 800 hectares of autumn vegetables, forage, and late-season crops have been replanted on more than 20,000 hectares of harvested wheat land.

In order to create conditions for intercropping wheat next year, all localities have paid attention to seed selection during the wheat harvest. Kaitong People's Commune in Tongyu County has designated seed selection plots and launched a mass movement of each person carefully selecting 20,000 ears of high-quality wheat seeds.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 7th. Heilongjiang Province has mobilized nearly one million laborers and a large number of combine harvesters and animal-powered harvesters to harvest spring wheat, ensuring that this year's spring wheat is harvested quickly and well.

By the end of July, spring wheat in various parts of Heilongjiang Province had matured one after another. This year's spring wheat is dense, has a large number of plants, and is tall, with large ears and full grains. In order to ensure a bumper harvest of spring wheat and that every grain is stored, people's communes and state-owned mechanical farms have adopted the method of harvesting one piece as it ripens, and have achieved cutting, pulling, picking, turning, and threshing simultaneously, improving the quality of the wheat harvest.

In order to speed up the spring wheat harvest, state-owned mechanical farms and people's communes with mechanical harvesting tools have created a complete set of measures for mechanized harvesting in the rainy season based on years of experience in mechanical wheat harvesting, so that this year's wheat harvest is generally five to seven days earlier than in previous years.

In the wheat harvest, in order to achieve a bumper harvest. and ensure that every grain returns home, many areas have launched a competition of "cut wheat without pulling ears, bundle wheat without dropping grains." It is required that commune members cut the stubble short, handle it gently, bundle it in small bundles, bundle it tightly, and bundle it neatly during the harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 7th. The wheat harvest in Inner Mongolia has been generally launched throughout the region. From Hulunbuir in the northernmost part of the autonomous region to Ordos in the southernmost part, 420,000 farmers of all ethnic groups have been投入in the wheat harvest battle. By August 2nd, 3.68 million mu of spring wheat had been harvested.

During the summer harvest, leading cadres from all localities went to the fields to participate in the rush harvest. In Bayannur League, a major wheat-producing area, more than 3,300 cadres at all levels participated in the rush harvest. In the rush harvest, all localities generally adopted the methods of cutting, pulling, threshing, putting into storage, and arranging the lives of commune members at the same time, achieving being busy without chaos, being fast without being sloppy, and combining work with rest. This year, during the wheat harvest, all localities have paid special attention to ensuring that every grain is stored. Kailu County has put forward the requirements of "harvesting in a timely manner, harvesting quickly and meticulously" and "harvesting without losing ears, bundling without losing grains."

Strong support for the summer harvest from all walks of life is also a characteristic of this year's wheat harvest in the autonomous region. On the Hetao Plain, 15,000 workers, cadres, and students from only five banners and counties, including Dalad Banner, Wuyuan Banner, Hanggin Rear Banner, and Urad Front Banner, supported the wheat harvest. Twenty-five units in Bayangol City sent 2,500 militiamen to participate in the wheat harvest. The industrial and commercial departments of Linhe County in this league have supplied 130,000 pieces of wheat harvesting tools.

While harvesting wheat, the entire region has also rushed to plant 3.91 million mu of late-season crops, 1.15 million mu of autumn vegetables, and 440,000 mu of replanted vegetables, and has strengthened the management of autumn fields. (Attached picture)

    吉林黑龙江内蒙古收割春小麦
    新华社长春7日电　吉林省各地冒雨抢收春小麦。据7月30日统计，全省已割春麦八万公顷。
    今年吉林省春小麦播种面积比去年扩大四分之一左右。由于各地人民公社采取冬种，加强田间管理等增产措施，使今年小麦普遍生长得秆粗、穗大、籽粒饱满。但是，当小麦普遍成熟，开镰收割以来，天气转坏，阴雨连绵。在这种情况下，广大社员拿出了冲天干劲，冒雨抢收。种麦最多的白城专区，在各级麦收指挥部指挥下，抽出80％以上的劳动力进行抢收，到7月末，收割面积已达30％以上。四平地区近日来各级党委书记亲自下田领导收麦，并组织无麦区群众前往支援，全区仅三两天时间，就抢割小麦61％。在抢收中，全省还出动各种收割机二千二百多台，大大加速了收麦进度。
    在突击收麦过程中，各地特别重视收割质量，做到收好、管好、颗粒不丢。通榆县在割、捆、码、拉等环节上，遍设拣麦卡，共组织五万一千多人拣麦，到7月27日，全县已拣回麦穗三万四千九百五十一斤。
    各地人民公社还采取了割、拉、拣、打、翻地、复种“一条龙”的办法，做到随收随种。四平地区在收割小麦中，组织了四千八百多个种秋菜和种饲料作物的专业小组，突击复种。长春地区，在割出的两万多公顷麦地上，已复种秋菜、饲料和晚田作物八百多公顷。
    为了给明年套种小麦创造条件，各地在麦收中都注意了选种工作。通榆县开通人民公社指定了选种地块，同时开展起每人精选两万穗优良麦种的群众运动。
    新华社哈尔滨7日电　黑龙江省出动近百万劳力和大批的联合收割机、畜力收割机收割春小麦，保证了今年的春小麦收得快、收得好。
    到7月底，黑龙江省各地的春小麦，相继成熟，今年这里的春小麦长的密、株数多，而且棵高、穗大、籽粒饱满。各地人民公社和国营机械农场，为保证春小麦丰产丰收，颗粒还仓，今年采取了熟一块割一块，并且作到了随割、随拉、随拣、随翻、随打，提高了麦收质量。
    为了加快春麦收割进度，在国营机械农场和有机械收割工具的人民公社，根据多年机械收麦的经验，创造了一整套在雨季实行机械化收割的措施，使今年小麦收割普遍比往年提前五天到七天。
    各地在麦收中，为了作到丰产丰收。颗粒还家，不少地区开展了“割麦不拉穗、捆麦不掉粒”的竞赛。要求社员在收割中做到了割槎矮、轻拿轻放、捆小捆、捆的紧、捆的齐。
    新华社呼和浩特7日电　内蒙古小麦收割已在全区普遍展开。从自治区最北部的呼伦贝尔到最南部的鄂尔多斯有四十二万各族农民投入麦收战斗。到8月2日已收割春小麦三百六十八万亩。
    各地在夏收中，领导干部都到田间参加抢收。小麦主要产区的巴彦淖尔盟参加抢收的各级干部达三千三百多人。在抢收中各地普遍采取了随割、随拉、随打、随入库、随安排好社员生活，做到忙而不乱，快而不粗，劳逸结合。今年收割小麦中各地特别注意做到颗粒还仓，开鲁县提出“适时收割，快收细打”，“割不丢穗，捆不丢粒”的要求。
    各行各业大力支援夏收，也是自治区今年收麦的一个特点。在河套平原上，仅达拉特、五原、杭锦后旗、乌拉特前旗等五个旗县就有一万五千名工人、干部、学生，支援麦收。巴彦高勒市二十五个单位，有二千五百名民兵参加麦收。这个盟临河县工商部门已供应麦收工具十三万件。
    全区在收麦的同时，还抢种晚田作物三百九十一万亩、秋菜一百一十五万亩、复种菜四十四万亩，并加强秋田管理。（附图片）
