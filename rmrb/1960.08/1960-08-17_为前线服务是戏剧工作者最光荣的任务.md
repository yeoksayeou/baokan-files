Serving the Front Lines is the Most Glorious Task of Drama Workers
	Zheng Yizou, Li Shengbing, Yin Guifang, Wang Min
	Our Fujian is located on the forefront of coastal defense, facing the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique entrenched in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, and the most vicious enemy of peace-loving people around the world - American imperialism. For eleven years, American planes and warships have frequently violated our country's territorial waters and airspace along the Fujian coast, instigated the Chiang bandits to constantly harass and sabotage the mainland, and continuously carry out war provocations. However, the enemy's war conspiracies and shameless provocations cannot scare us. The military and civilians on the front lines have dealt heavy blows to the enemy and taught them a severe lesson. In the battle environment, the military and civilians on the Fujian front lines are fighting and producing at the same time. On all fronts, including industry, agriculture, and culture, we have achieved great development and great leaps forward, just like all other parts of the country. All these victories have been achieved thanks to the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country. Since 1958, during the days when the military and civilians on the Fujian front lines severely punished the Chiang army in Jinmen with artillery fire, the people of the capital and many fraternal provinces and cities, even the people of fraternal ethnic regions in remote Xinjiang and Yanbian, sent their best artists to the front lines to express their appreciation to the military and civilians, which greatly encouraged the military and civilians on the front lines, and was also a great encouragement and support to the literary and art circles of our province.
	We would particularly like to thank the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who fight day and night on the front lines, guarding the gate of our motherland. Together with the people on the front lines, they have built an impregnable wall of iron and steel to defend the motherland. During the days of artillery battles, they fought heroically, promoted a high degree of communist spirit, and produced many heroes and heroic deeds, which greatly encouraged and educated the people of our province and the people of the whole country. Therefore, on the Fujian front lines, people regard supporting the front lines and ensuring victory in battle as their primary and most glorious task. Our literary and art circles are no exception. For eleven years, under the instructions of the Party, various literary and art troupes, especially drama troupes, have frequently gone to the front lines to conduct performance tours to show appreciation. In the most recent two or three years, the drama troupes across the province have made serving the front lines regular and planned, with at least one to two large-scale performances on the front lines each year.
	Chairman Mao taught us that revolutionary literature and art are powerful weapons for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy. In the performance activities on the front lines, everyone in the drama troupes deeply understood the profound meaning of these words. Every time a drama troupe performed for a company, it was a great encouragement and education for the soldiers. After each performance, the soldiers wrote letters and poems to express their determination to the comrades in the drama troupe, vowing to train well, learn culture well, and guard the gate of the motherland well, in order to repay the concern of the people of the province.
	However, in the regular performance process of serving the front lines, what we feel most profoundly is the education that participation in actual combat gives to our literary and art workers, especially the patriotic and revolutionary heroism of the soldiers and their spirit of hard work and simple living and their close relationship with the masses, which have greatly educated us. We deeply realize that literary and art workers must integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers in order to thoroughly transform their world outlook and make literary and art workers laborize and become workers and peasants. In the performance activities of the drama troupes on the front lines, contact and interaction with the soldiers played a role in promoting the changes in everyone's thoughts and feelings and the improvement of their political awareness. We personally saw on the front lines that the most vicious enemy of the people of the world - American imperialism - still occupies our country's territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu. They are constantly carrying out war preparations to invade our mainland. Their artillery is set up right in front of our eyes, and their warships and planes constantly and wantonly rampage in the territorial waters and airspace of our motherland. Many peaceful villages in the coastal areas of our province have been destroyed by American-made shells and bombs, and the lives of many people have been killed. How can the Chinese people, who have been subjected to imperialist oppression and bullying for a long time and have now stood up, tolerate the American bandits continuing to run rampant in our country!
	Through performance tours to show appreciation, the literary and art workers who serve the front lines have also undergone great changes in their thoughts and feelings. First of all, the fearless spirit of the front-line soldiers, who are loyal to their duties and protect socialist construction, and their heroic spirit of revolutionary optimism deeply moved every comrade. The front-line soldiers defend the gate of the motherland day and night, regardless of storms and heavy rain. They stand guard on the rocks by the sea. Sometimes, the strong typhoon makes it impossible for people to stand. They hold each other tightly to continue standing. If two people holding each other still cannot stand, they lie down on the ground and still look up to monitor the ocean. The comrades who went to the front lines to express appreciation saw the heroic posture of the sentries standing on the seashore and listened to the heroic deeds about them, deeply realizing that we can live a peaceful life because we have the people's soldiers taught by Chairman Mao, who work tirelessly day and night to protect us. Everyone expressed that they would learn from the soldiers' excellent qualities of being loyal to the people and serving the people wholeheartedly, and make greater contributions to the cause of socialism.
	The living conditions on the front lines are relatively difficult. Some small islands have no residents, but our soldiers still stick to them. There is no fresh water on the island, so it must be transported from other places by boat. The soldiers use water very sparingly. A small basin of water is used to wash their face, then kept to wipe their body, then kept to wash their feet, and then kept to water flowers and vegetables. When there is a typhoon, the water cannot be transported, and sometimes there is no water to drink or use. The wind and sand on the front lines are also very strong. The soldiers' hair and clothes are often full of mud and sand. Sometimes, when they eat, the mud and sand blow into the bowl. Under such living conditions, the soldiers never complain, but instead are proud of being able to endure hardship. They are always laughing and talking. They regard the front line position as their own home, where they grow vegetables, raise pigs, plant flowers, and plant trees, decorating the position beautifully. A poem by soldier Tang Wenli describes this scene: "The soldiers on the three islands are busy day and night, wanting to give the position a new look, planting willow trees beside the cannons, planting victory flowers beside the trenches, covering the top of the cave with evergreen grass, and welcoming spring in front of the fortress, the heroic position is as strong as steel, and the front-line home is as beautiful as a painting." The heroic spirit of revolutionary optimism and the excellent style of hard work and simple living of the front-line soldiers gave the comrades a very profound education. The actors realized that it was a supreme honor to be able to use their art to directly serve the heroic People's Liberation Army on the front lines. For example, some people in the Provincial Song and Dance Troupe used to emphasize the stage conditions very much, saying that the lighting should be like this and the sound should be like that, otherwise it would be difficult to perform. After going to the front lines to show appreciation, the "theory of conditions as the only factor" has now been completely broken. As long as there is a small piece of flat ground, even on muddy ground after rain, they will sing and dance for the soldiers. In various drama troupes, the communist style of not talking about working conditions and not calculating labor remuneration is constantly being promoted. Every time the various drama troupes return from a performance tour to show appreciation on the front lines, when they summarize their work, the members will use the heroic soldiers on the front lines as the standard, consciously check their own individualistic thoughts, extravagant waste, and all other shortcomings; every time they go to the front lines, their ideological awareness will be improved by one step. They all say: "The front lines are our best school."
	The noble proletarian feelings of the soldiers, who have a clear distinction between love and hate, have also given the literary and art workers who went to the front lines to show appreciation a great education. The comrades were very moved when they saw the scene of the front-line military and civilians as one family, as close as flesh and blood. The soldiers often help the people's communes on the front lines with production and water conservancy projects. Wherever there is a difficulty, the People's Liberation Army will appear. Their care for the people is truly meticulous. For example, a heroic class on the Huangqi Peninsula took on all the service work such as haircuts and medical treatment for the masses. In one performance tour to show appreciation, a shell suddenly fell nearby, and a soldier immediately covered an actor with his body, protecting his loved one with his own life. The soldiers love the people so much, but they hate the enemy and American imperialism infinitely. The American bandit Eisenhower's "visit" to the Far East made the soldiers extremely angry. When they received the order to bombard the god of plague, everyone was overjoyed and applauded and cheered. Every time they fired a cannon, they shouted a slogan: "The god of plague Eisenhower, go back, fire!" "American imperialism, get out of Taiwan, fire!"... These moving deeds gave the comrades an extremely profound class education. In the past, some people did not have a strong concept of the enemy and had the idea of peace and paralysis. Now, they have all improved their revolutionary vigilance and enhanced their hatred of the American imperialists and their running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek gang. The actors went to the front lines and asked to fire the cannons themselves to strike the enemy. When they saw the shells they fired blooming on the enemy's positions, they were so happy that they hugged the soldiers. Through performance tours to show appreciation on the front lines, the comrades not only greatly improved their ideological awareness, but also became stronger. The soldiers and comrades formed a close friendship in the common struggle. After leaving, they often corresponded, and when the People's Liberation Army comrades came to Fuzhou, they often came to the drama troupe to see us.
	The ideological feelings of the literary and art workers who went to the front lines to show appreciation have changed, and their artistic creation has also been significantly improved. What is particularly prominent is the artistic image of shaping heroic figures. The comrades personally saw the actions of the heroic figures on the front lines, personally heard the language of the heroic figures, and had a relatively deep understanding of the thoughts and feelings of the heroic figures, so they were able to create more successful heroic images on the stage. On our stage, more heroic figures who can inspire people have appeared. The countless heroic deeds on the front lines also stimulated the creative enthusiasm of the comrades and produced many good works; some were written and performed on the spot, closely linked to the central task, giving the soldiers great encouragement and receiving a warm welcome.
	The experience of our province's performance tours to show appreciation on the front lines has made us more deeply realize the unparalleled correctness of the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers as instructed by Chairman Mao. We will resolutely follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, forge ahead courageously, and better use the weapons of literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve socialist construction.

    为前线服务是戏剧工作者最光荣的任务
    郑奕奏　李盛斌　尹桂芳　王敏
    我们福建地处海防最前线，面对着盘踞在台、澎、金、马等地的蒋介石卖国集团，和全世界爱好和平人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义。十一年来，美国飞机、兵舰经常在福建沿海一带，侵犯祖国的领海、领空，并唆使蒋匪军不断向大陆进行骚扰破坏，不断进行战争挑衅。但是，敌人的战争阴谋和无耻挑衅吓不倒我们。前线军民给予敌人以重大打击，狠狠地教训了敌人。在战斗的环境里，福建前线军民边战斗边生产，在工业、农业和文化等各个战线上和全国各地一样，都获得了大发展、大跃进。所有这一切胜利，都是由于党中央和毛主席的英明领导和全国人民热情支持而取得的。1958年以来，在福建前线军民严惩金门蒋军的炮战日子里，首都和许多兄弟省市直到边远的新疆、延边兄弟民族地区人民，都把自己最好的艺术家派到前线来，慰问前线军民，给前线军民很大鼓舞，对我省文艺界也是个很大的鼓舞和支持。
    我们要特别感谢中国人民解放军，他们日日夜夜战斗在前线，守卫着祖国的大门。他们和前线人民一起，筑成了保卫祖国的铜墙铁壁。在炮战的日子里，他们英勇战斗，发扬了高度的共产主义风格，涌现出许许多多英雄人物和英雄事迹，给我省人民和全国人民以很大的鼓舞和教育。因而，在福建前线，人们把支援前线，保证战斗胜利，当成为自己首要的最光荣的任务。我们文艺界也不例外。十一年来，在党的指示下，各文艺团体，特别是剧团，经常深入前线进行慰问演出。最近两三年来，全省各剧团已经把为前线服务做到了经常化、计划化，每年至少一次至两次大规模地到前线演出。
    毛主席教导我们，革命文艺是团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力武器。各个剧团在前线演出活动中，大家都深深体会到这话的深刻意义。剧团每到一个连队演出，对战士们都有很大的鼓舞和教育。每次演出以后，战士们都纷纷写信、写诗，向剧团同志表示决心，一定要练好兵、学好文化，守好祖国的大门，以报答全省人民的关怀。
    但是，在经常性的为前线服务的演出过程中，我们感受最深刻的，还是参加实际斗争对我们文艺工作者的教育，特别是战士们那种爱国主义、革命英雄主义的精神和艰苦朴素跟群众亲如一家的作风，对我们有很大教育。我们深深体会到，文艺工作者必须与工农兵相结合，从而彻底改造自己的世界观，使文艺工作者劳动化、工农化。剧团的同志在前线的演出活动中，和战士们接触交往，对每个人思想感情的变化和政治觉悟的提高，都起了促进的作用。我们在前线亲眼看到全世界人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义，至今还霸占着我国的领土台、澎、金、马等地。他们无时无刻不在进行着侵略我国大陆的战争准备，他们的大炮就架在我们的眼前，他们的兵舰、飞机经常地肆无忌惮地在祖国的领海、领空横冲直闯。我省沿海一带许多和平村庄被美制炮弹、炸弹所摧毁，许多人的生命被杀害，长期地遭受帝国主义压迫、欺侮而今站起来的中国人民怎能容忍美国强盗再继续在我国横行霸道下去呢！
    通过慰问演出，到前线服务的文艺工作者，在思想感情方面也起了很大的变化。首先前线战士们那种忠于职守，保卫社会主义建设的大无畏精神和革命乐观主义的英雄气概，深深地感动了每个同志。前线战士们不分白天黑夜，不管狂风暴雨，时刻捍卫着祖国的大门。他们在海边的岩石上站岗，有时强大的台风刮得人站不住，他们就两个人抱在一起坚持站下去，两个人抱着还是站不住，就俯伏在地上，仍然抬起头监视着海洋。到前线慰问的同志们看到屹立在海边的哨兵的雄姿，听了关于他们的英雄事迹，深刻地体会到我们能够过着和平的生活，就是由于有了毛主席教导出来的人民子弟兵，日夜不辞辛劳地在保卫着我们。大家表示要向战士们这种忠心耿耿为人民服务的优良品德学习，为社会主义事业做出更大的贡献。
    前线的生活条件是比较困难的。有些小岛上没有居民，我们的战士仍然坚守在那里。岛上没有淡水，要从外地用船运去，战士们用水十分节约，一小盆水洗了脸，留着擦澡，擦了澡留着洗脚，洗了脚留着浇花浇菜。遇到了台风，水运不来，有时就没得喝，没得用。前沿的风沙也很大，战士们的头发和衣服经常满是泥沙，有时吃饭的时候，泥沙就刮到碗里去。在这样的生活条件下，战士们从来不叫苦，反而以苦为荣。他们总是有说有笑。他们把前沿的阵地当成了自己的家，在那里种菜养猪，栽花植树，把阵地打扮得漂漂亮亮。战士唐文礼有一首诗就是描写这个情景的：“三岛战士日夜忙，要为阵地换新装，炮旁栽上万年柳，壕边种上胜利花，洞顶铺上长青草，堡前迎春发新芳，英雄阵地坚似钢，前线家园美如画。”前线战士们这种革命乐观主义的英雄气概和他们艰苦朴素的优良作风，给了同志们十分深刻的教育。演员们认识到能够用自己的艺术直接为前线英勇的解放军服务是无上的光荣。如省歌舞团过去有些人十分强调舞台条件，什么灯光应该怎样，音响又应该怎样，否则很难演出。经过到前线慰问演出，现在完全打破了“唯条件论”，只要有一小块平坦的地方，就是在雨后泥泞的地上，他们也要为战士们歌舞。在各个剧团中，那种不讲工作条件，不计劳动报酬的共产主义风格正在不断地发扬。各个剧团每次到前线慰问回来总结工作时，团员们都会以前线英勇的战士做为标准，自觉地检查自己的个人主义思想、铺张浪费作风和其他一切缺点；每到前线一次，思想觉悟就提高一步。他们都说：“前线是我们最好的学校。”
    战士们那种爱憎分明的崇高的无产阶级感情也给了到前线慰问的文艺工作者极大的教育。同志们看到前线军民一家，亲如骨肉的情景，十分感动。战士们经常帮助前线的人民公社搞生产，修水利，哪里有困难，哪里就出现解放军。他们对老百姓的爱护真是无微不至，例如黄歧半岛一个英雄班，把群众的理发、治病等服务性工作都包下来。在一次慰问演出中，忽然一颗炮弹落在附近，一位战士立即用身体掩盖在一位演员身上，用自己的生命来保护亲人。战士们对人民是这样地爱，对敌人、对美帝国主义却无比地仇恨。美国强盗艾森豪威尔“访问”远东，战士们气愤极了。当他们接到炮轰瘟神的命令，个个兴高彩烈，鼓掌欢呼。他们每发一炮，就高呼一句口号：“瘟神艾森豪威尔滚回去，开炮！”“美帝国主义滚出台湾去，开炮！”……这些动人的事迹给了同志们极其深刻的阶级教育。过去有些人敌情观念不强，存在着太平麻痹的思想，现在都提高了革命警惕性，增强了对美帝国主义者及其走狗蒋匪帮的仇恨。演员们到了前线，要求亲自开炮，打击敌人。当他们看到自己发射的炮弹在敌人的阵地上开花，高兴得和战士们拥抱起来。通过到前线慰问演出，同志们不但思想觉悟有了很大的提高，而且锻炼得更加坚强了。战士们和同志们就在共同的斗争中结成了亲密的友谊，离开后经常通信，解放军同志到福州时也经常到剧团来看我们。
    到前线慰问的文艺工作者，思想感情起了变化，艺术创造也显著提高了。特别突出的，是表现在塑造英雄人物的艺术形象上。同志们在前线亲眼看到了英雄人物的行动，亲耳听到了英雄人物的语言，对英雄人物的思想感情有了比较深刻的认识，因此在舞台上就能够塑造出比较成功的英雄形象来。在我们的舞台上，更多地出现了能够鼓舞人心的英雄人物。前线无数的英雄事迹还激发了同志们的创作热情，产生了许多好作品；有些是当场编写演出，紧密结合中心任务，给战士们很大的鼓舞，受到热烈欢迎。
    从我省前线慰问演出的经历，使我们更深刻地体会到毛主席所指示的文艺为工农兵服务的方向的无比正确性，我们坚决遵循毛主席所指引的方向，勇往直前，更好地以文艺的武器为工农兵服务，为社会主义建设服务。
