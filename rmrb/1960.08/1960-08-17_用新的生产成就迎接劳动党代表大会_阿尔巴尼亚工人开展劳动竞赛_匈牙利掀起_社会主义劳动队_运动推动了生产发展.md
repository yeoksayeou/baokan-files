Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, August 12th: The Stalin Textile Factory in Tirana, Albania, the largest textile factory in the country, has initiated a proposal to launch a labor emulation campaign nationwide to greet the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party to be held in November this year with new production achievements.

This factory guarantees to overproduce products worth 50 million leks (Albanian currency) this year. Since its establishment in 1951, the factory's production has increased year by year. In the first quarter of this year, the factory overproduced products worth 31 million leks. This factory has promoted the development of Albania's textile industry. Albania used to import textiles, but now it can not only meet domestic needs but also export them.

The workers in the two most important sectors of the Albanian national economy, the petroleum industry and the mining industry, have repeatedly raised their original production targets. Recently, they have also resolved to overfulfill this year’s production plan, which will triple total output from 1955 and bring production levels to twenty times pre-war levels.

Due to the widespread labor emulation campaign, the production volume of various mining departments has increased significantly. From January to July this year, they produced 113,220 tons more crude oil, 8,427 tons more coal, 25,764 tons more chromium ore, and 37,474 tons more iron-nickel ore than in the same period last year.

After completing the second quarter plan by 103%, the Stalin Petroleum Joint Factory overproduced 4,967 tons of crude oil in July. Each unit of the factory has put forward new guarantees to greet the Party Congress. For example, the drilling department proposed to complete the expanded plan for 1960 and the second five-year plan respectively on November 8, the Party's birthday, and November 29, the Albanian Liberation Day.

In the Skutari region, twenty-one of the twenty-seven enterprises overfulfilled their production plans in July.

The workers in the two coastal cities of Durrës and Vlorë, who have been engaged in labor emulation since the beginning of this year, now guarantee to present new achievements to the Party Congress. The workers of the Vlorë food enterprise completed the July plan by 102.87%, and their production competition has developed from individual and workshop competitions to factory-to-factory competitions.

The movement to strive for the titles of "Socialist Labor Brigade" and "Socialist Labor Shock Worker" is also underway nationwide. At present, there are more than 700 production teams striving for this glorious title, with more than 5,000 workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 13th: The Hungarian "Socialist Labor Brigade" movement is booming nationwide. At present, there are more than 14,000 labor teams participating in this competition across the country, and 3,000 of them have already won the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Brigade."

The development of the "Socialist Labor Brigade" movement has played a significant role in promoting production. Almost all the miners in the Komló coal mining area participated in this movement. Thanks to their production enthusiasm, the members of more than 100 labor teams in the coal mining area have completed their annual production increase task five months ahead of schedule, overproducing 30,600 tons of coal beyond the plan. Now they have made another guarantee to increase production by 60,000 tons of coal by the end of the year. The members of the "Németné Socialist Labor Brigade" of the Sopron Textile Factory have made remarkable achievements in producing high-quality products. Since the beginning of this year, they have maintained an indicator of producing 99% high-quality products, which is 11% higher than the national average.

In the "Socialist Labor Brigade" movement, the workers promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. The members of the best "Németné Socialist Labor Brigade" in the Budapest Linen Factory launched a "fifteen minutes" movement in the workshop to vigorously assist backward production teams. The team members came to work fifteen minutes early every day and were responsible for repairing machines and teaching operating methods to the novices in the workshop. As a result, the labor productivity of the entire workshop was further improved.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 16th: Young people in various parts of Hungary are launching voluntary labor and production emulation campaigns in various forms on different fronts. The slogan of the youth of the Csepel Iron and Steel Works is: Replace manual labor with machines. Now they have already made a cart for transporting hot steel in their spare time. The young workers of the Csepel Bicycle Factory proposed to complete the task of producing twenty-seven new tools one week ahead of the scheduled deadline.

The young workers of the Red Csepel Power Plant in Budapest launched a "Communist Sunday" movement. They used voluntary labor on Sundays to assemble wires for the new plant buildings. The Communist Youth League members of the Eger Engine Factory in Heves County guaranteed to complete this year’s production plan five days ahead of schedule and reduce the scrap rate by 30% as a gift to the Hungarian Communist Youth League Congress to be held in December. In addition, they also guaranteed to do 3,000 hours of voluntary labor for the nearby agricultural cooperative. The young workers of the Hungarian National Machine Factory took turns going to the countryside in their spare time to help the cooperatives with harvesting.

Students from major universities and middle schools also actively participated in various meaningful labor activities during the summer vacation. They organized many "voluntary youth construction camps" throughout the country.

In the wheat fields of agricultural production cooperatives and on various construction sites, one could also see such "youth voluntary labor teams" working enthusiastically.

    用新的生产成就迎接劳动党代表大会
    阿尔巴尼亚工人开展劳动竞赛
    匈牙利掀起“社会主义劳动队”运动推动了生产发展
    新华社地拉那12日电　阿尔巴尼亚最大的纺织工厂——地拉那斯大林纺织工厂发起倡议在全国开展劳动竞赛，以新的生产成就迎接将在今年11月召开的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第四次代表大会。
    这个工厂保证今年要超额生产价值五千万里克（阿币名）的产品。这个厂自1951年建厂以来，生产逐年上升。今年，这个工厂在第一季度就超额生产了价值三千一百万里克的产品。这个厂已促进了阿尔巴尼亚纺织工业的发展。阿尔巴尼亚以前要进口纺织品，现在已不仅能满足国内的需要，而且还能出口。
    阿尔巴尼亚国民经济中两个最重要的部门——石油工业和采矿工业的职工们一再提高他们原订的生产指标。最近他们又决心在今年超额完成其总产量将为1955年的三倍、生产水平将等于战前的二十倍的生产计划。
    由于广泛展开了劳动竞赛，各采矿部门的生产量已显著地增加。他们在今年1月至7月，比去年同时期多生产了十一万三千二百二十吨原油；八千四百二十七吨煤，二万五千七百六十四吨铬矿，三万七千四百七十四吨铁—镍矿。
    斯大林石油联合工厂在以103％完成第二季度计划以后，7月份计划又超额生产了四千九百六十七吨原油。这个厂的各单位都为迎接党代会提出了新的保证。如钻探部门提出要在11月8日党的生日和11月29日阿尔巴尼亚解放日分别完成1960年和第二个五年计划的扩大计划。
    在斯库台全区的二十七个企业中，7月份有二十一个企业超额完成了生产计划。
    从今年初就展开劳动竞赛的都拉斯和发罗拉两个滨海城市的职工，现在保证都以新的成就向党代表大会献礼。发罗拉食品企业的职工以102.87％完成了7月份计划，他们已从个人、车间之间的生产竞赛发展到厂与厂之间的竞赛。
    在全国范围内争取“社会主义劳动队”和“社会主义劳动突击手”称号的运动也正开展。目前，争取这种光荣称号的生产队已有七百多个，工人数达五千多人。
    新华社布达佩斯13日电　匈牙利“社会主义劳动队”运动正在全国范围内蓬勃发展。目前全国参加这一竞赛的劳动队已有一万四千多个，其中有三千个已经争取到了“社会主义劳动队”的光荣称号。
    “社会主义劳动队”运动的开展在推动生产方面起了很大的作用。柯姆洛煤区的矿工差不多全体参加了这个运动。煤区的一百多个劳动队的队员们由于发挥了生产积极性，已经提前五个月完成了全年的增产任务，超计划生产了三万零六百吨的煤。现在他们又提出保证，到年底要再增产六万吨煤。索普伦纺织厂的“社会主义劳动队”队员在生产优质产品方面成绩卓著，今年以来他们一直保持了生产99％优质产品的指标，比全国的平均水平高11％。
    在“社会主义劳动队”运动中，工人们发扬了互助协作的精神。布达佩斯纺麻厂最优秀的“内梅特奈社会主义劳动队”的队员们在车间内开展了大力协助落后的生产队的“十五分钟”运动。队员们每天提早十五分钟上班，负责为本车间的新手检修机器并传授操作方法。结果，全车间的劳动生产率进一步提高了。
    据新华社布达佩斯16日电　匈牙利各地青年正在不同的战线上，用各种形式，掀起了义务劳动和生产竞赛运动。切佩尔轧钢厂的青年的口号是：用机器代替手工。现在他们已经在业余时间制成了一个推运热钢材的车子。切佩尔自行车厂的青年职工们提出要比规定期限提前一周完成生产二十七种新工具的任务。
    布达佩斯红色切佩尔发电厂的青年职工们发起了一个“共产主义星期日”运动，他们在星期天用义务劳动为新厂房装配电线。海威斯州艾盖尔发动机工厂的共青团员们保证提前五天完成今年生产计划，并使废品率降低30％，作为给将在12月举行的匈牙利共产主义青年团代表大会的献礼。另外，他们还保证为附近的农业合作社作三千小时的义务劳动。马国机器厂的青年职工利用业余时间轮流下乡，帮助合作社收割。
    各大中学校的学生也利用暑假积极参加了各种有意义的劳动。他们在全国各地组织了很多“自愿青年建筑营”。
    在各地农业生产合作社的麦田里和各种建筑工地上，也都可以看到这样的“青年义务劳动队”在热情地劳动着。
