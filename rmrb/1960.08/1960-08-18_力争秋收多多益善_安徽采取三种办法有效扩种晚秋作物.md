    Strive for a Bumper Autumn Harvest
    Anhui Adopts Three Methods to Effectively Expand Late Autumn Crop Planting
    (Our newspaper's Hefei dispatch, August 17th) Anhui is actively expanding the planting of late autumn crops. As of August 12th, the province had planted 8,520,000 mu of late autumn crops including grains and vegetables.
    In order to maximize the area of ​​late autumn crops, people's communes in various places have adopted various effective methods, the most important of which are three: First, all arable land that can be cultivated must be planted, and all available gaps must be fully utilized. Due to the implementation of "Five Expansions" in the province this spring, the area of ​​early autumn crops currently being harvested has increased, which has created favorable conditions for expanding late autumn crops. Currently, more than 6 million mu of late autumn crops have been planted in the fields. At the same time, various places are tapping the potential of the land by means of intercropping, relay planting, and utilizing gaps, striving to plant more and harvest more.阜阳 Fuyang Prefecture alone has planted 380,000 mu of late autumn crops on the vacant land and abandoned land that has been found.
    Second, select a variety of crop varieties and plant them in accordance with local conditions and seasons, based on their growth period and adaptation to the climate. People's communes in various places have made unified arrangements based on stubble and labor, and have prepared sufficient sets of seeds to ensure that planting is plentiful and timely. At present, various places are mainly concentrating their efforts on planting double-season late rice, late corn, late sweet potatoes, and late mung beans. Among the late autumn grain crops that have been planted, these crops account for more than 90%.
    Third, while expanding the planting of food crops, plant autumn vegetables on a large scale, striving to not leave an acre of land idle. As of the 12th, the province had planted 1,520,000 mu of autumn vegetables.
    While expanding the planting area of ​​late autumn crops, whether it is food crops or vegetables, all localities prominently focus on high-yield crops to ensure high yields and abundant harvests. In the沿江 Yanjiang and 淮南 Huainan areas, the first priority is to rush to plant double-season late rice, mobilize more than 2 million laborers, and rush to harvest early rice and rush to transplant late rice, so that the daily progress of double-season late rice transplanting has reached more than 300,000 mu, and 4.4 million mu have been planted, an increase of 800,000 mu over last year. Late sweet potatoes and late corn, these two high-yield crops, have also been planted on 1.34 million mu in various places.

    力争秋收多多益善
    安徽采取三种办法有效扩种晚秋作物
    本报合肥17日电　安徽各地积极扩种晚秋作物。到8月12日，全省已种下粮食和蔬菜等晚秋作物八百五十二万亩。
    为了尽量扩大晚秋作物的面积，各地人民公社都采取了各式各样的有效办法，其中最主要的有三种：第一，把一切能种的耕地全部种上，并充分利用一切空隙地。由于全省今春实行了“五扩大”，目前正在收获的早秋作物面积增多了，这就为扩大晚秋作物创造了有利条件。现在各地在大田里抢种上的晚秋作物已达六百多万亩。与此同时，各地以间种套种和利用空隙地等办法，挖掘土地的潜力，力争多种多收。仅阜阳专区就在找出的空白地和荒废地上种上了三十八万亩晚秋作物。
    第二，选择多样农作物品种，根据它们的生长期长短、对气候的适应情况等，因时因地制宜种植。各地人民公社都根据茬口、劳力等情况，进行了统一安排，备足了几套种子，保证种得又多又适时。目前各地主要是集中力量种植双季晚稻、晚玉米、晚甘薯和晚绿豆等作物。现已种下的晚秋粮食作物中，这些作物占90％以上。
    第三，在扩种粮食作物的同时，大种秋菜，力争不闲一亩土地。全省到12日为止，就已种下秋菜一百五十二万亩。
    各地在扩大晚秋作物种植面积的同时，不论是粮食作物还是蔬菜，都突出地抓高产作物，保证高产多收。在沿江和淮南地区，首先是抢种双季晚稻，调集了二百多万劳动力，突击抢收早稻和抢栽晚稻，使双季晚稻的栽秧日进度达到了三十多万亩，已栽下四百四十万亩，比去年增加了八十万亩。晚甘薯和晚玉米这两种高产作物，各地也已种下了一百三十四万亩。
