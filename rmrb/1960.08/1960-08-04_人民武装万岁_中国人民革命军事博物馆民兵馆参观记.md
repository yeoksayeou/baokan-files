Long Live the People's Armed Forces
A Visit to the Militia Hall of the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution
Xinhua News Agency Reporter: Jiang Qingzhao, Gu Fan

For the past two days, the magnificent Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution has attracted a large audience. In the Militia Hall, people see how the militia, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, together with their heroic army, defeated powerful enemies at home and abroad and marched from victory to victory in the course of more than 30 years of combat. Here are the flags, armbands, cap badges, and symbols of the Red Guards, Riot Teams, and Young Pioneers from the old revolutionary base areas more than 30 years ago, as well as the spears, lances, and various swords and other ancient weapons they used. There are also various rifles, wooden cannons, grenades, landmines, and various spoils of war captured from the enemy, all made by the militia themselves in the anti-Japanese base areas and liberated areas; documentary photos and important documents of militia combat; and animated models and diorama boxes that showcase the endless wisdom of the militia, such as landmine warfare, tunnel warfare, and cave warfare....

"The deepest source of the power of war lies in the masses of the people." This is a famous saying of Chairman Mao. People cannot help but be deeply moved by the first red flag displayed here, the spear engraved with "Long Live the Success of the Revolution," and several bird guns and flintlocks. This is the flag that the old Red Guards in Hengshan, Chaling, Liling, and other places in Hunan held high, and the weapons they used to kill the enemy, during the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by our great leader Chairman Mao 33 years ago. It was the spark that started a prairie fire. From then on, on Jinggang Mountain, on the banks of Honghu Lake, under the Dabie Mountains, on the Loess Plateau..., the flames of the people's revolutionary struggle were ignited everywhere. An animated map vividly shows that during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, there were 2.56 million Red Guards and Young Pioneers in the ten old revolutionary base areas across the country. Armed with spears, broadswords, firelocks, daggers, and other weapons, they surged forward to cooperate with the main Red Army in combat and became a strong source of recruits for the Red Army.

The audience was attracted by a glittering animated sand table. It allowed the younger generation to see the vivid scene of how their revolutionary elders used inferior weapons to encircle and annihilate more than 700 Kuomintang reactionary troops in the Helong area of Ruijin 30 years ago.

In the glass cabinet, there is also a row of weapons of merit, cast by the old Red Guards with their lives and blood. The audience saw a short, crude bamboo cannon, which the Red Guards in the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Soviet Area used to participate in more than 40 battles, killing more than 200 enemies. The earth cannon used by the "Cannon Team" of the Red Guards in Chaling County, Hunan Province, which used gunpowder from ox horns, had repeatedly achieved great feats in the past. In the Battle of Jiulu Chong alone, it cooperated with the Red Army to capture more than 2,000 enemies with foreign cannons and seized more than 2,000 guns. This is the broadsword used by Han Xuteng, the Red Guard Captain of Duchang County, Jiangxi Province. He wielded this sword and killed seven enemy soldiers, capturing two rifles. Next to it is the steel fork used by Mei Zhengxi, a Red Guard fighter in Huangpi County, Hubei Province, which had stabbed five enemy soldiers to death. There is also the oil basket used by Zheng Liqi, an old Red Guard member from Ziyun Township, Zhouning County, Fujian Province. Thirty years ago, he used the hollow bottom of this bamboo-woven oil basket to store intelligence and ammunition, repeatedly escaping the searches of the "White Dogs" and safely delivering them to the Red Army.

A large number of cultural relics from the Anti-Japanese War period in the Militia Hall vividly tell the audience that tens of thousands of militia in the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines, in the dense forests and vast fields, sometimes gathered from scattered units to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army in demolishing bridges and roads, attacking cities and defending fortresses; sometimes they dispersed from gathered units, appearing and disappearing mysteriously, causing the Japanese invaders to be frightened and terrified. They created various ingenious tactics such as landmine warfare, tunnel warfare, sparrow warfare, encirclement warfare, and sabotage warfare, developing the art of people's armed struggle to an unprecedented peak.

Historical relics sent from the Luxi Plain make people forever unforgettable the heroic history of Zhanglou, a "heroic village" in Chiping County, Shandong Province. In December 1944, the Japanese invaders and puppet troops gathered nearly 1,000 people to "mop up" Zhanglou Village, which had only more than 200 households, and a fierce battle unfolded. More than 700 of the 1,100 men, women, and children in the entire village took up earth guns, earth cannons, grenades, kitchen knives, and stones to directly participate in the battle, resisting the enemy for four days and nights. The enraged enemy concentrated more than 40 machine guns, lined them up in a row, and opened a gap in the earthen wall protecting Zhanglou Village. The women and old people immediately moved out the adobe bricks and quilts from the heated brick beds, poured water on them, blocked the wall, and continued to fight. After suffering more than 250 casualties, the enemy fled in a panic. More than two months later, more than 1,200 enemies launched an even more frantic attack on Zhanglou Village. The people followed one after another, sacrificing their lives. When the husband sacrificed, the wife stepped up; when the son fell, the father picked up the gun.... After three days of bloody battle, although many militiamen in Zhanglou Village heroically sacrificed, the Japanese invaders paid an even greater price in casualties. In the end, the unyielding people of Zhanglou Village, under the leadership of the Party, organized guerrillas again and continued to fight until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.

Yuan Xiang, the famous hero of the tunnel warfare militia in central Hebei, came to the Militia Hall. He stood in front of a glass cabinet displaying a row of rusty shovels, picks, lamps, kitchen knives, grenades, and rifles, and told the audience about the victorious record of the central Hebei militia defeating the Japanese invaders with tunnel warfare. This is a special form of people's war created by the wisdom of the people. When the animated model of tunnel warfare is opened, you can see that on the vast central Hebei Plain, the surface is dotted with enemy strongholds, but the underground, dozens of meters deep, is a completely different world. There, the tunnels are interconnected and crisscrossed. Thousands of guerrilla groups and hundreds of thousands of militiamen are active in the underground "Great Wall," appearing and disappearing to strike the enemy. The militiamen of Shijing Village used tunnels as long as ten li to fight more than 100 battles, eliminating more than 160 enemies. Some of the weapons and equipment they captured from the Japanese invaders are now on display here. After Yuan Xiang finished telling the heroic story, he proudly said in a burst of warm applause: "We follow Chairman Mao, we fight with Chairman Mao, and we will always be clear in our hearts. We have ways to deal with the enemy!"

As the animated model flashes, the audience can see huge battle maps and rows of weapons of merit. This is the magnificent scene of the vast militia participating in the War of Liberation. Look, on the dusty roads, two teams are advancing side by side. One team is the powerful People's Liberation Army, and the other is the militia carrying rifles and grenades, carrying stretchers, and pushing carts. These two teams converge into endless torrents, heading mightily towards the battlefields full of gunfire. On the snowy banks of the Liao River, on the thousand-mile battlefield of the Huaihai Campaign, from the Loess Plateau in northern Shaanxi to the coast of the South China Sea, thousands upon thousands of militiamen and the People's Liberation Army formed a fighting collective. Wherever the People's Liberation Army fought, the militia supported them. Every battle and every victory had the great achievements of the militia.

The pictures, landmines, and sand table of "The Militia in Central Shandong Sets Up a Minefield" are fascinating. Here, the audience saw that during the famous Battle of Laiwu in 1947, dozens of flying demolition teams composed of militiamen in the central Shandong region set up minefields everywhere in the mountains and fields and on the roads and paths, blooming everywhere, and causing the Chiang Kai-shek troops to be frightened and unable to move. In this famous battle at home and abroad, the People's Liberation Army, with the cooperation of the militia, achieved a major victory by annihilating seven entire brigades of the Chiang Kai-shek army.

Among the large number of meritorious weapons on display, four large gourds are particularly eye-catching. This is the tool used by the "River Defense Bastion Du Balian" militia in Ji yuan County, Henan Province, to conquer the natural barrier of the Yellow River. In the autumn of 1946, the heroic militia used it to float across the turbulent Yellow River and destroy three enemy planes on the other bank. An earth cannon with only half a barrel left records the battle achievements of the militia in Gaoyu Village, Shandong Province. In 1947, they set up this earth cannon on the coast of the Yellow Sea, sinking one Kuomintang navy motorboat, capturing another, and capturing eight enemies. The manure shovel used by militiaman Zhao Tingyou to capture an enemy soldier and seize a rifle, and the broadsword, sickle, and iron claw used by militiamen Lu Xuegui and Li Jinting to kill the enemy are also on display here. These militia weapons vividly tell people that although weapons are an important factor in war, it is people, not things, that determine the outcome of the war. Revolutionary people's armed forces have always defeated enemies with superior equipment with inferior equipment.

The Chinese people have won. In the new China after liberation, for the past ten years, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, a strong national defense force has been built, and hundreds of millions of militiamen have been armed. They are learning from the example of their revolutionary elders, inheriting the glorious fighting tradition, and together with the heroic People's Liberation Army, building a bronze wall and iron bastion of the motherland's frontier. In the Militia Hall, the heroic deeds of the younger generation of militia of all ethnic groups in suppressing bandits, maintaining social order, capturing American and Chiang Kai-shek paratrooper spies, and severely attacking the Chiang Kai-shek army on Jinmen are displayed. From the diorama box, the audience can see a combat scene of "capturing an American Air Force colonel alive": An American military plane invaded the airspace of Andong and was immediately shot down by our powerful People's Air Force, crashing near Wulongbei. The militia there laid a dragnet, encircled and suppressed, and quickly captured eleven American aerial bandits who parachuted down alive. Among them was an American Air Force Colonel Arnold. Look at his embarrassed appearance! He was frightened and trembling in front of the Chinese militia, raising his hands in surrender. Now, the aggressor's pistol, map, survival card, and parachute are displayed next to the diorama box, as evidence of the American aggressor's crimes and a symbol of their shameful end.

A large number of cultural relics in the Militia Hall vividly tell the audience that in the past war years, the vast militia cooperated with their own army to defeat all enemies at home and abroad; today, the Chinese people are holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong's military thought of people's war and are vigorously running militia divisions. If the enemy dares to invade our great motherland, they will surely be drowned in the ocean of people's war of hundreds of millions of militiamen. (Attached picture)

    人民武装万岁
    中国人民革命军事博物馆民兵馆参观记	新华社记者　姜庆肇　古凡
    两天来，雄伟壮丽的中国人民革命军事博物馆，吸引了广大观众，人们在民兵馆里，看到毛泽东思想武装下的民兵，在三十多年的战斗历程中，是怎样同自己的英雄军队一起，打败了国内外强大的敌人，从胜利走向胜利。这里有三十多年前革命老根据地赤卫队、暴动队、少年先锋队的旗帜、袖章、帽徽和符号和他们用过的梭镖、长矛和各种刀枪剑等古老武器；有各种抗日根据地和解放区民兵自己制造的步枪、木炮、手榴弹、地雷和缴自敌人的各种战利品；有民兵战斗纪实照片和重要文献；还有闪亮着民兵无穷智慧的地雷战、地道战、窑洞战等电动模型和布景箱……。
      “战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中”。这是毛主席的名言。人们不能不为陈列在这里的第一面红旗和刻着“革命成功万岁”的梭镖以及几支鸟枪、火药枪所深深感动。这是三十三年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席领导湖南秋收起义，衡山、茶陵、醴陵等地老赤卫队员们高举过的旗帜和杀敌武器。它是燎原的星星之火，从此，在井冈山上，在洪湖之滨，在大别山下，在陕北高原……，到处燃起了人民革命斗争的烽火。一幅电动地图形象地表明，第二次国内革命战争期间，在全国十块革命老根据地上，就有二百五十六万赤卫队和少先队员，他们手持梭镖、大刀、火枪、匕首等武器，风起云涌地配合主力红军作战，并且成为扩大红军的雄厚的兵源。
    观众们被一座闪闪发光的电动沙盘所吸引。它使年青的一代，看到了三十年前，革命长辈们怎样用低劣的武器，在瑞金的合龙地区，围歼七百多名国民党反动军队的生动情景。
    玻璃柜内，还陈列着一排排功勋武器，它们是老赤卫队员们用生命和热血铸成的。观众们看到一门短小粗陋的竹节炮，闽浙赣苏区赤卫队曾用它参加过四十多次战斗，打死了二百多名敌人。湖南茶陵县赤卫队“大炮队”当年用来屡建奇功的牛角上火药的土大炮，单是在九路冲之役，就配合红军俘虏了二千多名拥有洋大炮的敌人，并缴获了两千多支枪。这是江西都昌县赤卫队长韩绪腾使用的大刀，他挥舞着这把刀杀死了七名敌军，缴获两支步枪。旁边，是湖北黄陂县赤卫队战士梅正喜使用的钢叉，曾刺死了五名敌军。还有福建周宁县紫云乡老赤卫队员郑立歧使用的油篓，三十年前，他用这个竹编油篓底部的空凹装上情报和弹药，多次逃过“白狗子”的搜查，安全地送给红军。
    民兵馆里大批抗日时期的文物生动地告诉观众：敌后抗日根据地成千上万的民兵，在密密的森林和辽阔的原野上，忽儿化零为整，配合八路军和新四军拆桥破路、攻城守池；忽儿化整为零，神出鬼没，打得日寇心惊胆战。他们创造了地雷战、地道战、麻雀战、围困战、破击战等各种各样巧妙的战术，把人民武装斗争的艺术发展到前所未有的高峰。
    从鲁西平原送来的历史文物，使人们永远难忘山东茌平县张楼这个“英雄村”的壮烈史迹。1944年12月，日寇和伪军纠集了近千人“扫荡”只有二百多户人家的张楼村，一场恶战展开了。全村男女老幼一千一百人，有七百多人拿起土枪、土炮、手榴弹、菜刀和石头，直接参加了战斗，抗击敌人四昼夜。恼羞成怒的敌人集中四十多挺机关枪，平排着把保护张楼村的土围墙打开一个缺口。妇女和老人们立刻搬出火炕的土坯和棉被，浇上水堵塞围墙，继续战斗。敌人在死伤二百五十多名后，狼狈败走。两个多月后，一千二百多敌人又对张楼村发动了更疯狂的进攻。人民前仆后继，丈夫牺牲了，妻子顶上去；儿子倒下了，父亲拿起枪……，血战三日，虽然张楼村的好多民兵壮烈牺牲了，但是日寇付出了更大的伤亡代价。最后，不屈的张楼村人民在党的领导下又组织起游击队，继续战斗到抗日战争胜利。
    著名的冀中地道战民兵英雄苑祥，来到了民兵馆，他站在陈列着一排锈迹斑斑的铁锹、镐头、灯盏、菜刀、手榴弹和步枪的玻璃柜前，向观众们讲述了当年冀中民兵用坑道战打败日寇的胜利战绩。这是人民智慧创造的一种特殊形式的人民战争。当打开地道战的电动模型时，可以看到：辽阔的冀中平原，地面上是敌人星罗棋布的据点，十几米深的地下却完全是另一个世界，那儿地道四通八达，纵横交错，千万个游击组，几十万民兵活跃在地下“长城”，时隐时现地打击敌人。石井村民兵利用长达十华里的地道，作战一百多次，消灭一百六十多敌人，他们缴获日寇的一部分武器装备，现在陈列在这里。苑祥讲完英雄故事后，在一片热烈的掌声中自豪地说：“我们跟着毛主席走，跟着毛主席打仗，永远心里亮堂堂，有的是对付敌人的办法！”
    随着电动模型的闪光，观众可以看到，一张张巨大的战役地图，一排排功勋武器，这是解放战争中广大民兵参战的雄壮场面，看，在尘土飞扬的大路上，同时有两支队伍并肩前进，一支是强大的解放军队伍，一支是背着步枪、手榴弹，扛着担架和推着小车的民兵。这两支队伍汇成一条条无尽的洪流，浩浩荡荡奔向炮火连天的战场。在大雪纷飞的辽河两岸，在千里纵横的淮海战场，从陕北高原到南海之滨，千千万万的民兵和解放军结成了战斗的集体。解放军打到哪里，民兵支援到哪里。每一次战役，每一个胜利，都有着民兵的丰功伟绩。
    “鲁中民兵大摆地雷阵”的图片、地雷和沙盘，引人入胜。观众们在这里看到了1947年著名的莱芜大战中，鲁中地区民兵组成的几十个飞行爆炸队，在群山野岭，在大道小径，到处摆下地雷阵，四面开花，炸得蒋军心惊肉跳，寸步难行。在这次闻名中外的战役中，解放军在民兵配合下，取得了全歼蒋军七个整旅的重大胜利。
    陈列的大批功勋武器中，四个大葫芦特别惹人注目。这是当年河南济源县“河防堡垒杜八联”民兵征服天险黄河的工具。1946年秋天，英雄的民兵用它浮水渡过汹涌澎湃的黄河，到对岸捣毁了三架敌军的飞机。一门只剩下半截炮筒的土炮，记载着山东高峪村民兵的战斗功勋。1947年，他们在黄海之滨架起这门土炮，打沉国民党海军汽艇一艘，另外缴获一艘，俘虏了八名敌人。民兵赵廷有俘敌一名缴获步枪一支所使用的粪铲，民兵卢学桂、李金亭用来砍死敌人的大刀、镰刀和铁爪钩，也都陈列在这里。这些民兵武器，生动地告诉人们，武器虽然是战争的重要的因素，但决定战争胜负的是人，不是物。革命的人民武装从来都是以劣势的装备，打败了装备上占优势的敌人。
    中国人民胜利了。解放了的新中国，十年来，在党和毛主席领导下，建设一支强大的国防军，也武装起亿万民兵，他们学着革命长辈的榜样，继承着光荣的战斗传统，和英雄的人民解放军一道筑起万里疆防的铜墙铁壁。在民兵馆里，陈列着青年一代的各族民兵在肃清残匪、维持社会治安、捕捉美蒋空降特务和痛击金门蒋军的英雄事迹。观众们可以从布景箱看到一场“活捉美国空军上校”的战斗情景：一架美军飞机侵入我安东上空，当即被我强大的人民空军击落，掉在五龙背附近。那里的民兵布下天罗地网，合击围剿，很快就把十一个跳伞降落的美国空中强盗活捉了。其中有一个美国空军上校阿纳德，看他那副狼狈相！他在中国的民兵面前，吓得浑身发抖，举手投降。现在，这个侵略者的手枪、地图、求生证和降落伞陈列在布景箱一旁，作为美国侵略者的罪证，也标志着他们的可耻下场。
    民兵馆里大批文物鲜明地告诉观众：在过去战争年代里，广大民兵配合自己的军队，打败国内外一切敌人；今天，中国人民正高举着毛泽东人民战争军事思想的红旗，大办民兵师。要是敌人胆敢侵犯我们伟大祖国，就一定被淹死在亿万民兵的人民战争的汪洋大海里。（附图片）
