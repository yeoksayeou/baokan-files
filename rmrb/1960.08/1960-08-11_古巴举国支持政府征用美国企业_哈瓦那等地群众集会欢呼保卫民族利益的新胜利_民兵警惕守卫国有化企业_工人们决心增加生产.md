Xinhua News Agency, Havana Telegram - The Cuban government's measure to nationalize twenty-six major American enterprises has received unanimous and resolute support nationwide. People everywhere are cheering this action to defend national interests.

The Cuban Workers' Confederation decided on August 8th to make this week "People's Joy Week" to celebrate the nationalization of American enterprises.

In the capital Havana, Santiago, and many other cities, residents immediately took to the streets to hold demonstrations and mass rallies upon hearing the news. Jubilant people sang the national anthem and shouted slogans such as "Long live the revolution!"

In Havana, on the evening of August 8th, tens of thousands of people poured from all corners of the capital towards the coast, carrying torches, flowers, and national flags. Workers from the nationalized American-owned Cuban Telephone Company led the way carrying a coffin, symbolizing the burial of the company. The large banner held by the telephone workers read: Now we work for Cuba. This company, with capital of over 80 million pesos, had sucked the blood and sweat of countless Cuban people. The current U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Bonsal, was once a senior executive of this company. During the Batista dictatorship, this company presented a gold telephone to Batista as a gift. The Cuban people called this company an octopus. Therefore, when the workers publicly burned a paper octopus amidst laughter, cheers, and enthusiastic applause, people enthusiastically danced and sang songs calling for Cuba and not American Yankees.

Workers from the Cuban Electric Company held a mass rally in front of the company's building on the afternoon of August 8th. A large Cuban flag and a banner were hung on the building, which read: This is the property of the Cuban people. Workers' leaders who spoke at the meeting unanimously expressed their support for the nationalization of American enterprises.

In Santiago, 50,000 people participated in a grand rally.

The crowds at the Santa Clara rally shouted slogans such as "Yankees go home!" When students in Matanzas held a demonstration, people from all walks of life joined the demonstration. Workers there organized a motorcade of cars and trucks all the way to El Morrillo, where people held a rally at the site where the Batista dictator murdered Antonio Guiteras, a fighter against imperialism. At many mass rallies, resolutions were passed suggesting that the nationalized Cuban Electric Company be named "Antonio Guiteras Electric Company" in memory of his struggle against this electric power trust.

In Pinar del Río, a demonstration of 5,000 people took place, and in the suburbs and streets there, people sang and danced to express their joy. When the people of Santiago de las Vegas held a meeting, they raised their arms and solemnly swore: We will not hesitate to shed the last drop of blood to defend the nationalization of American monopoly companies.

Factories and trade unions across the country held workers' congresses, which, while expressing support for nationalization, decided to work hard to increase production. Workers in Las Villas province pledged to increase labor productivity and strengthen the militia organization. Tobacco workers at the "Partagás" factory stated that they were "vigilant against any retaliatory actions the imperialists might take against Cuba."

The Executive Bureau of the National Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party wrote to Prime Minister Castro, congratulating and fully supporting the government's signing of the "historic resolution to nationalize most American companies." The letter expressed confidence that this brave and bold step will stir the hearts of all Latin America and Cuba's friends around the world, and will once again promote a great wave against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs and agents.

Hundreds of congratulatory messages and statements of support for the government poured into newspaper offices from all over the country. They came from workers, farmers, and mass organizations, including the National Union of Sugar Workers, the Federation of Cuban Electrical Enterprise Unions, the Federation of Cuban Telephone Workers' Unions, and the National Federation of Cuban Petroleum Workers. The National Federation of Cuban Petroleum Workers stated in a statement that the nationalization of American enterprises is a powerful response by the Cuban people to the US imperialist aggression plan, and also encourages all Cuban workers to promote the country's industrialization plan by working hard to increase production.

Currently, worker militias are guarding the nationalized enterprises with guns. The government has appointed administrators to take over the American enterprises. After work, the worker militias are also strengthening military training to be more effective in defending national wealth and defending the motherland.

According to the Cuban "Revolutionary News," the total value of the nationalized American enterprises is estimated at 829 million pesos. Among them, the value of the sugar mills is 371 million pesos; the value of the oil refineries is 55 million pesos; the value of the Cuban Electric Company is 320 million pesos; and the value of the Cuban Telephone Company is 83 million pesos.

    古巴举国支持政府征用美国企业
    哈瓦那等地群众集会欢呼保卫民族利益的新胜利
    民兵警惕守卫国有化企业　工人们决心增加生产
    据新华社哈瓦那电　古巴政府把二十六家美国大企业收归国有的措施得到举国一致的坚决支持。人们到处都在欢呼这一保卫民族利益的行动。
    古巴工人联合会8日决定本星期为“人民欢乐周”，来庆祝把美国企业收归国有的措施。
    在首都哈瓦那和圣地亚哥以及其它许多城市里，居民们在听到这一消息后，立即走上大街举行示威游行和群众集会。欢腾的人们高唱着国歌，高呼“革命万岁”等口号。
    在哈瓦那，8日晚有成千上万的人从首都各个角落拥向海滨，手里拿着火把、鲜花和国旗。被收归国有的美资古巴电话公司的工人抬了一口棺材走在最前头，作为埋葬这家公司的象征。电话工人拿着的大标语写道：现在我们为古巴而劳动。这家公司拥有八千多万比索的资本，吮吸了无数古巴人民的血汗。现任美国驻古巴大使邦沙尔曾是这家公司的高级职员。在巴蒂斯塔独裁统治期间，这家公司曾把一台金制电话送给巴蒂斯塔做礼物。古巴人民把这家公司叫作乌贼。因此，当工人们在笑声、欢呼声和热烈的掌声中当众烧掉一个纸制乌贼的时候，人们热情地跳舞和高唱要古巴不要美国佬的歌曲。
    古巴电力公司的工人8日下午在这家公司的大楼前面举行了群众集会。大楼上悬挂着一面大幅古巴国旗和一幅标语，上面写着：这是古巴人民的财产。在会上发言的工人领袖一致表示支持把美国企业收归国有。
    在圣地亚哥，有五万人参加了盛大的集会。
    圣克拉拉集会的人群高呼“美国佬滚回去”的口号。当马坦萨斯的学生举行示威游行时，其他各阶层人民也纷纷参加示威的行列。那里的工人组织了一支汽车和卡车队，一直通到埃耳莫里略，人们在这个巴蒂斯塔独裁者杀害反对帝国主义的战士安东尼奥·基特拉斯的地点举行了集会。在许多群众集会上，都通过决议建议把收归国有的古巴电力公司命名为“安东尼奥·基特拉斯电力公司”，以纪念他为反对这家电力托辣斯所进行的斗争。
    在比那尔德里奥举行了有五千人参加的示威游行，在那里的郊区和大街上，人们载歌载舞，表示他们的欢乐心情。圣地亚哥德拉斯维加斯的人民举行大会时，高举手臂庄严宣誓：不惜流尽最后一滴血，来保卫对美国垄断公司实行的国有化。
    全国各地的工厂和工会都举行了工人大会，这些大会在表示支持国有化的同时，决定要努力增加生产。拉斯维利亚斯省的工人保证提高劳动生产率和加强民兵组织。“帕尔塔加斯”工厂的烟草工人表示，他们“警惕着帝国主义企图采取的任何对古巴进行报复的行动”。
    古巴人民社会党全国委员会执行局写信给卡斯特罗总理，对政府签署“把大部分美国公司收归国有的历史性的决议”表示祝贺和完全支持。这封信表示相信，这个勇敢和大胆的步骤将使整个拉丁美洲和古巴革命在全世界朋友们的心中激动起来，并将再次促进反对美帝国主义及其走狗和代理人的巨大浪潮。
    数以百计的表示支持政府的贺电和声明，从全国各地涌到了报社。它们来自工人、农民和群众团体，其中包括全国糖业工人联合会、古巴电力企业工会联合会、古巴电话工人工会联合会和古巴全国石油工人联合会。古巴全国石油工人联合会在声明中指出，把美国企业收归国有是古巴人民对美帝国主义侵略计划的有力的回击，同时也鼓舞着所有的古巴工人以努力提高生产来推进国家的工业化计划。
    目前，工人民兵正在荷枪守卫被收归国有的企业。政府已经委任了接收美国企业的管理员。工人民兵在下班后，还加强军事训练，准备更有力地保卫国家财富和保卫祖国。
    据古巴“革命报”报道，被收归国有的美国企业的价值估计总数为八亿二千九百万比索。其中糖厂的价值为三亿七千一百万比索；石油冶炼厂的价值为五千五百万比索；古巴电力公司的价值为三亿二千万比索；古巴电话公司的价值为八千三百万比索。
