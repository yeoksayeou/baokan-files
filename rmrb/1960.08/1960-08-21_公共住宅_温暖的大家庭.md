Public Housing – A Warm, Big Family

    Li Caiyun, a childcare worker at the Pyongyang City Nursery in North Korea, moved into a newly built residential building last year. Recently, she wrote to her younger sister, Li Caiyu, who works as a spinner at the Qingjin Spinning Mill, about her new home: "I love our home. It's not just that the apartment has good light, complete heating and plumbing, convenient interior furnishings, and kitchen equipment. The main reason I love this home is that I love the people in this building—the members of our big family."

    Strangers Become Family
    The public housing where Li Caiyun lives is located in Zhongcheng-dong, Zhong District, a bustling area of Pyongyang. It is a "U-shaped" six-story building. Last autumn, more than 800 families moved into their new homes from all directions. Among them were workers, staff, doctors, journalists, and artists. They were all strangers at first, and some elderly people initially worried about not getting along with their neighbors. However, ideological and political unity eliminated all barriers between them. Within an hour of moving in, the children became good friends, and the sisters-in-law and aunties began to chat and laugh. After three days, the men had also become acquainted.
    Then, everyone began to decorate the inside and outside of the residential building. They paid close attention to the cleanliness of the building, began to establish new living habits, and cultivated a spirit of collectivism. Soon, everyone became close. The more than 800 families became a loving big family.

  One Person in Trouble, Everyone Helps
    One night, Park Soon-ae's child suddenly became seriously ill, coughing severely and crying incessantly. Her husband, a car driver, was on duty in another location that night. In the middle of the night, Park Soon-ae held her newborn child, anxious and not knowing what to do.
    Just then, someone knocked on the door. It was her neighbor, the female doctor Kim Bok-sil. She asked, "How is the child? Is it serious?" After taking a look at the child, she hurried out. After a while, Kim Bok-sil returned breathlessly, carrying her medical bag. It turned out that she had run all the way to the Zhong District Hospital where she worked to get medicine. After diagnosis and medication, the child quickly recovered.
    This female doctor not only cared about the Soon-ae family but also cared very much about the health of everyone in the residential building.

    Resolving Difficulties Better Than Relatives
    At the beginning of this year, a small disturbance occurred in the home of boiler worker Kim Ik-chan. Kim Ik-chan's seventeen-year-old daughter, Bong-joo, graduated from junior high school and wanted to go out to work, but her stepmother, Hwang Byung-ok, refused to let her, arguing that the housework was too busy and she needed her eldest daughter to stay at home to take care of the five children. Her neighbors, Kim Bong-up and Heo Young-soon, after learning the details, talked to Hwang Byung-ok, saying, "Don't you have kindergartens and nurseries for those children? Besides, we neighbors can also help out when we have time! Young people should be allowed to go out to learn skills and contribute to the country…"
    With the help of her neighbors, the stepmother slowly came to understand. Soon, Bong-joo entered the Pyongyang Electrical Appliance Factory and is now a capable technician. Kim Ik-chan's family lives happily together. One day, Hwang Byung-ok said to her neighbors with a smile, "Look, that Bong-joo of mine bought me this woolen scarf with her wages!…"
    As the saying goes, "A close neighbor is better than a distant relative." The people living in this building take care of and help each other in this way. They not only excellently complete their production tasks but also arrange their lives well. In the collectivist big family, they feel happiness and warmth, and they are working together to create a better life.

    公共住宅——温暖的大家庭
    朝鲜平壤市营托儿所的保育员李彩云，去年搬进了新建的住宅大楼。最近她写信给在清津纺纱厂当纺纱工的妹妹李彩玉，谈到关于新住宅的情况时说：“我热爱我们的住宅。这并不只是这个住宅光线好、取暖和水道设备齐全、室内陈设和厨房设备都很方便。我说爱这个住宅，主要是我热爱这个住宅里的人们——我们大家庭的成员。”
    萍水相逢  成一家
    原来李彩云住的这所公共住宅，位于繁华的平壤市中区中城洞，这是一座“匸形”的六层大楼。去年秋天，八百多户人家从四面八方搬进新居。他们当中有工人、职员、医生、记者、艺术家，他们都是萍水相逢，开始时很陌生，有些老年人起初担心同邻居关系搞不好。可是，思想和政治上的一致，使他们消除了一切隔阂。搬进新居还不到一小时，孩子们首先就成了好朋友，大嫂、大娘也开始谈笑。过了三天，男人们也都相识了。
    接着，大家开始把住宅大楼里里外外装饰起来。他们经常注意住宅的清洁卫生，开始建立新的生活习惯，培养集体主义精神。不久，大家便逐渐亲密起来。八百多户人家变成了一个友爱大家庭。
  一人有难众人帮
    一天夜晚，朴顺爱的小孩忽然得了急病，咳嗽得很厉害，啼哭不止。她的丈夫是汽车司机，当晚正在外地值勤。深更半夜，朴顺爱抱着初生的小孩，急得不知如何是好。
    正在这时，有人敲门。进来的是邻居的女医生金福实。她问道：“孩子怎么样，厉害吗？”接着把孩子看了一看，就匆忙走出去。过了一阵，金福实提着医药皮包，气喘地跑回来，原来她一直跑到自己工作的中区医院取药回来。经过诊断服药后，孩子很快就好了。
    这位女医生不仅关心顺爱一家，而且非常关心住宅大楼里所有人的健康。
    排难解纷赛亲人
    今年年初，锅炉工金益赞的家里发生了一场小小的风波。金益赞的十七岁的女儿凤珠初中毕业了，要求出去工作，可是继母黄炳玉却不让她去，理由是家务太忙，要大女儿留在家里照看五个小孩。她的邻居金凤业、许英顺知道底细后，就找黄炳玉谈心，对她说：“你那些小孩，不是有幼儿园和托儿所吗？再说，我们这些邻居也可以抽空帮忙的啊！年轻人嘛，总该让他们出外学习技术，为国家贡献力量……”。
    在邻居的帮助下，继母慢慢想通了。不久，凤珠进了平壤电器厂，现在已成了有能力的技工。金益赞的一家过得亲亲热热。有一天，黄炳玉向邻居笑嘻嘻地说：“你看，我那凤珠，用她的工资给我买了这条毛围巾！……”。
    俗话说：“远亲不如近邻。住在这所大楼的人们，就是这样彼此互相爱护、互相帮助。他们不仅出色地完成生产任务，而且很好地安排生活。在集体主义的大家庭中，他们感到幸福和温暖，正在为创造更美好的生活而共同努力。
