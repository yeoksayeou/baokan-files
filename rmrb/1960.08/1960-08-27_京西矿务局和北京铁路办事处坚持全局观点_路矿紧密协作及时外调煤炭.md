The Jingxi Mining Bureau and Beijing Railway Bureau Adhere to the Overall Situation, Road and Mine Closely Cooperate to Timely Transfer Coal

(Our report) The Beijing Jingxi Mining Bureau and the Beijing Railway Bureau resolutely implement the principle of "the whole country as a single chessboard." Both parties cooperate closely and have excellently completed the task of transferring Jingxi coal to other places.

More than half of the coal produced by the Jingxi Mining Bureau is supplied to other regions, including Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Shanghai, and other provinces and cities. Since the beginning of this year, the task of transferring Jingxi coal to other places has been completed relatively well. In the first half of this year, except for the coal transferred to Hebei Province, which only completed 97.9% of the plan, the coal transferred to other provinces and cities overfulfilled the transfer task. In July, the coal transferred to various provinces and cities all overfulfilled the plan.

The main reason why the Jingxi Mining Bureau and the Beijing Railway Bureau have achieved such results is that the leaders of these two units frequently conduct thorough ideological education on the "whole country as a single chessboard" for all cadres and workers, and resolutely implement the principle of "external before internal" in the allocation of coal and the distribution of transportation capacity. At the beginning of this year, both the road and mine parties took a series of measures to ensure the completion of the coal transfer task. First, the dispatchers of both parties grasped the plan and implementation of the coal transfer, settled accounts every shift, and checked every day; the leaders of the road and mine parties grasped it every five days, and if there was any imbalance, they tried to reverse it quickly. The coal shipped to Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other places from January to July this year has overfulfilled the plan every month. Secondly, they implemented the principle of "distant before near" in the allocation of coal and the dispatch of vehicles, giving priority to sending coal to southern provinces and cities such as Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Vehicles are given priority to mines that are far away and have poor transportation conditions, such as Datai and Muchengjian. The coal from these mines is first pulled out and sent to other provinces and cities, and then the nearby ones are transported.

The fundamental guarantee for completing the coal transfer task is to increase coal production and improve transportation efficiency. Since the beginning of this year, all employees of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, under the slogan of "vigorously increasing coal production and supporting national construction," have launched a vigorous high-yield campaign. In the first half of this year, they overfulfilled the national plan by 11.89%. At the same time, the employees of various mines under the Jingxi Mining Bureau and the employees of the Mentougou Railway Central Station worked side by side, supporting each other in terms of manpower and material resources, making great efforts in the mechanization and streamlining of loading and unloading, and carried out large-scale transformation of the five loading points, realizing the "direct in and direct out" of the entire train loading, which constantly shortened the vehicle stop time. The average stop time in January this year was three hours, and by July it had been shortened to 1.85 hours. (Attached picture)

The Hongshan No. 1 Coal Washing Plant of Zibo Mining Bureau in Shandong Province has completed its external transfer tasks ahead of schedule every month. In the first half of this year, the amount of refined coal transferred to support Wuhan Iron and Steel increased by 41.4% compared with the same period last year. This is a large batch of refined coal being loaded and transported. (Photo by Ai Chuansheng, reporter of Xinhua News Agency)

### 京西矿务局和北京铁路办事处坚持全局观点  路矿紧密协作及时外调煤炭

    京西矿务局和北京铁路办事处坚持全局观点
    路矿紧密协作及时外调煤炭
    本报讯　北京京西矿务局和北京铁路办事处坚决贯彻执行“全国一盘棋”的方针，双方通力协作，出色地完成了京西煤的外调任务。
    京西矿务局所产的煤，有一半以上供应外地，其中包括河北、江苏、浙江、湖北、上海等省、市。今年以来，京西煤外调任务完成得一直比较好。今年上半年，除调往河北省的煤炭只完成计划的97.9％之外，调往其他省、市的煤炭都超额完成了外调任务。7月份，外调到各省、市的煤，全都超额完成了计划。
    京西矿务局和北京铁路办事处所以能取得这样的成绩，主要是因为这两个单位的领导人员经常对全体干部和工人深入地进行“全国一盘棋”的思想教育，并在煤炭的分配和运输力的支配上，坚决地执行了“先外后内”的原则。今年一开始，路矿双方就采取了一系列的措施，保证完成煤炭外调任务，首先是，双方的调度人员全都掌握煤炭外调的计划和执行情况，每班一结算，每日一检查；路矿领导方面五天抓一次，一旦出现了不均衡的现象就设法迅速扭转。今年1至7月份运往上海、江苏、浙江等地的煤，月月都超额完成计划。其次，他们在分配煤炭和调度车辆的工作中实行“先远后近”的原则，尽先向上海、江苏、浙江等南方的省、市发送。车辆尽先派往大台、木城涧等距离较远、运输条件较差的矿，先把这些矿的煤拉出来送往外省、市，随后再运送近处的。
    完成煤炭外调任务的根本保证，是增加煤炭的产量和提高运输效率。今年以来，京西矿务局全体职工在“大力增产煤炭，支援国家建设”的口号下，开展了轰轰烈烈的高产运动，今年上半年超额11.89％完成了国家计划。同时，京西矿务局所属各矿的职工和门头沟铁路中心站的职工并肩作战，在人力、物力上相互支援，大闹装卸机械化、滑溜化，并对五个装车点进行了大规模的改造，实现了“直出直入”的整列装车，使车辆停站时间不断缩短。今年1月平均的停站时间为三小时，到7月份已经缩短到一点八五小时。（附图片）
