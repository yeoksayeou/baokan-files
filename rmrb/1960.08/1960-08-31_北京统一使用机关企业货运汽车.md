Upholding the Communist Spirit of Cooperation to Promote the Continuous Development of Productive Forces
Beijing Unifies Use of Cargo Trucks from Organizations and Enterprises
Private Use Becomes Shared Use with Six Major Benefits: 1. Rapidly improves transportation efficiency; 2. Facilitates rational dispatch and use of vehicles; 3. More effectively implements the principle of "guaranteeing key needs and taking care of general needs"; 4. Comprehensively arranges vehicle maintenance and upkeep, improving vehicle integrity rate; 5. Reduces management personnel, saves fuel and materials, and lowers transportation costs; 6. Facilitates extensive technological innovation and the promotion of advanced experience.

(Our dispatch) Beijing’s various organizations and enterprises have unified their “one household, one car” privately used cargo trucks, cooperating with specialized transportation departments to participate in urban transportation, greatly unleashing the potential of the vehicles. The daily output of vehicles has increased by about 150%, playing a significant role in guaranteeing the continued leap forward of current industrial and agricultural production.

The cargo trucks owned by Beijing's organizations and enterprises account for 60% of the city's total cargo trucks. However, they only undertake about 20% of the city's freight volume, indicating a great potential for transportation. After investigation and research, the Beijing Transportation Command believes that only by changing the privately used cargo trucks of each unit to unified use can the potential of the vehicles be fully utilized, ensuring the needs of production development. Over 80% of the self-provided vehicles of organizations and enterprises are responsible for transportation outside factories and mines, and these vehicles can be completely organized and used uniformly.

Before the unified organization, the Party organizations of the seven districts and five counties under Beijing explained to the relevant units the principle of fully utilizing the superiority of the socialist system, vigorously promoting the communist spirit of cooperation, and continuously promoting the leap forward of production in socialist construction. This resolved the concerns of some cadres who feared that it would be inconvenient to use vehicles and that the transportation tasks of their own units could not be guaranteed. Over the past year, the vehicles organized successively by various districts (counties) in Beijing have accounted for 95% of the vehicles that can be organized.

Based on the characteristics of self-provided cargo trucks being widely distributed, having complex tasks, and belonging to different units, Beijing has adopted three forms of vehicle teams in organizing this work: large concentration, small concentration, and on-site formation. The large concentration vehicle team takes the district (county) as the unit, implementing unified leadership, unified use, unified planning, unified accounting, and unified arrangement of transportation tasks. This part of the vehicles is drawn from units with few transportation tasks or more vehicles. They mainly complete social transportation, but when the original unit has urgent needs, they are given priority for transportation. The small concentration vehicle team concentrates the vehicles and personnel of several units with the same task nature or nearby locations into small teams, implementing unified leadership and unified dispatch. The small teams are responsible for contracting tasks, repairs, and economic accounting, implementing the principles of mutual support, convenience, and mutual benefit, mainly completing the transportation tasks of units with vehicles, and supporting social transportation when they have spare capacity. The on-site formation vehicle team generally has large tasks, many vehicles, and a dedicated management agency within the unit. This form adopts the method of not moving vehicles or personnel, and forming several vehicle teams nearby according to region or system. The transportation departments of each district (county) issue transportation quotas according to the number of vehicles and conduct regular inspections to improve transportation efficiency. In addition, for the hundreds of vehicles in the construction system with unfixed work locations and large vehicle mobility, they are organized according to the system and unified dispatch and use are implemented with specialized transportation departments.

More than a year of practice has proven that unified use of self-provided vehicles from organizations and enterprises has six major benefits: First, it rapidly improves transportation efficiency. According to statistics for the first half of this year, the average daily output per vehicle ton of the organized self-provided vehicles has increased from about three tons in the past to 7.66 tons, transporting 13,000 tons of goods more per day, which is equivalent to 3,220 four-ton cargo trucks transporting goods once. Second, it facilitates rational dispatch and use of vehicles, achieving full loads and more transportation. Each vehicle team uniformly arranges vehicles according to the size of the freight volume. Large vehicles or trailers are used when there is a lot of goods, and small vehicles are used when there is little goods. "Hitchhiking" transportation is implemented for the scattered materials of nearby factories and enterprises. At the same time, teams are formed according to the flow of goods. For shippers whose locations are close and directions are opposing, circular transportation is formed, fully leveraging the potential of transportation. Third, because self-provided cargo trucks have unleashed their potential, they can more effectively implement the principle of "guaranteeing key needs and taking care of general needs." Now, most of the materials needed for production in Beijing's various organizations and small and medium-sized enterprises and the commodities supplied to the market are undertaken by the organized self-provided vehicles. In this way, the specialized transportation departments can concentrate their efforts on transporting materials needed for iron and steel production and key construction projects. Fourth, it can comprehensively arrange vehicle maintenance and upkeep, rationally allocate materials and accessories, and improve the integrity rate of vehicles. Currently, each vehicle team has established maintenance and upkeep systems and set up full-time maintenance personnel. The city has also decentralized seven repair factories to various districts as bases for repairing self-provided vehicles of organizations and enterprises, so that the integrity rate of vehicles has rapidly increased. Fifth, it can reduce management personnel, establish an economic accounting system, save fuel and materials, accelerate capital turnover, and reduce transportation costs. The transportation costs of many organized vehicle teams have been reduced by an average of about half compared to before. Sixth, after the drivers and loaders scattered in various units are concentrated and formed into teams, Party and Youth League organizations have been generally established, political and ideological work has been strengthened, and it is convenient to exchange advanced experiences and carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements. The drivers and loaders of each vehicle team have also launched red flag competitions to compare who has more freight volume, faster turnover, lower costs, and better safety, fully leveraging the enthusiasm of drivers and loaders.

    发扬共产主义协作精神促进生产力不断发展
    北京统一使用机关企业货运汽车
    专用变共用有六大好处：一、迅速提高了运输效率；二、便于合理调度和使用车辆；三、更有效地贯彻“保证重点，照顾一般”的方针；四、全面安排车辆的维修保养，提高车辆的完好率；五、减少管理人员，节约燃料、材料和降低运输成本；六、便于广泛开展技术革新和推广先进经验
    本报讯　北京各机关企业将“一家一户”专用的货运汽车，统一组织起来，同专业运输部门分工协作，参加市内运输，大大发挥了车辆的潜力，使车辆日产量提高一倍半左右，对当前工农业生产继续跃进起了很大的保证作用。
    北京机关企业自备的载货汽车占全市货运汽车总数的60％。但所担负的货运量只相当于全市货运量的20％左右，运输潜力很大。北京市运输指挥部经过调查研究，认为只有把各个单位专用的货运汽车改为统一使用，才能充分发挥车辆的潜力，保证生产发展的需要。机关企业的自备汽车，80％以上都是担负厂矿外部的运输，这些车辆完全可以统一组织起来，统一使用。
    在统一组织以前，北京市所属七个区和五个县的党组织，都向有关单位说明了在社会主义建设中，必须充分发挥社会主义制度的优越性，大兴共产主义协作之风，不断促进生产跃进的道理，解决了有些干部怕用车不方便、本单位运输任务保证不了的顾虑。一年多来，北京各区（县）陆续组织起来的车辆已占可以组织起来的车辆的95％。
    根据自备货运汽车分布广、任务复杂、所属单位不同的特点，北京在组织这项工作的过程中，采取大集中、小集中和就地编队三种形式组成车队。大集中车队，以区
  （县）为单位，实行统一领导、统一使用、统一计划、统一核算和统一安排运输任务。这部分车辆是从运输任务不多或车辆较多的单位中抽出来的。它们以完成社会运输为主，但对原单位有紧急需要时，优先进行运输。小集中车队，把任务性质相同或就近几个单位的车辆、人员集中在一起，组成小队，实行统一领导、统一调度。小队负责包任务、包修理、包经济核算，执行互相支援，方便互利的原则，以完成有车单位的运输任务为主，有余力时支援社会运输。就地编队的车队，一般是本单位任务大、车辆多、有专门管理机构。这种形式采取车辆、人员不动，就近按地区或按系统编成若干车队，各区（县）运输部门根据车数下达运输指标，并定期检查，以提高运输效率。另外，对工作地点不固定，车辆流动性大的建筑系统的几百辆汽车采取按系统组织起来，与专业运输部门实行统一调度使用。
    一年多来的实践证明，统一使用机关企业自备汽车有六大好处：第一，迅速地提高了运输效率。据今年上半年统计，组织起来的自备汽车平均车吨日产量已经从过去的三吨左右提高到七点六六吨，每天可以多运一万三千吨货物，等于三千二百二十辆载重四吨的货运汽车运送一次。第二，便于合理调度和使用车辆，做到满载多运。各车队都根据运量大小来统一安排车辆，货多时用大车或者加挂拖车，货少时用小车，对相近工厂企业的零星物资则实行“捎脚”运输，同时根据货物流向排队，对地点临近，方向对流的托运单位，组成循环运输，充分发挥了运输的潜力。第三，由于自备货运汽车发挥了潜力，就能更有效地贯彻了“保证重点，照顾一般”的方针。现在，北京各机关、中小企业生产所需的物资和市场供应的商品，大部分都由组织起来的自备汽车担负。这样，就使专业运输部门能够集中力量运输钢铁生产和重点建设所需的物资。第四，能够全面安排车辆的维修保养，合理调剂材料、配件，提高车辆的完好率。目前，各车队都订立了维修保养制度，设立专职的修理保养人员。全市也将七个修理厂下放到各个区，作为修理机关企业自备汽车的基地，使车辆的完好率迅速提高。第五，可以减少管理人员，建立经济核算制度，节约燃料、材料，加速资金周转，降低运输成本，许多组织起来的车队，运输成本平均比以前降低一半左右。第六，分散在各单位的司机和装卸工人，集中编队后，普遍建立了党、团组织，加强了政治思想工作，并且便于交流先进经验，开展技术革新和技术革命运动，各个车队的司机和装卸工人，还纷纷展开比运量多、周转快、成本低、安全好的红旗竞赛，充分发挥了司机和装卸工人的积极性。
