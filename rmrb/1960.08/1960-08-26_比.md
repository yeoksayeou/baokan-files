"Compare, learn, catch up, and help" – these four words summarize a series of activities in the production increase and economy drive labor emulation campaign; and the "compare" word is the first and most important link in these activities. Through comparison, superiors and inferiors are distinguished, and then the backward learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and the advanced help the backward. Without comparison, there is no way to learn, no way to catch up, and no way to help.

The method of "compare" is a method of encouraging effort and striving for the top. Some workers in Shanghai put forward a slogan: "Don't close the door and call yourself king," which very well illustrates the importance of comparison. Without comparing with others, closing the door and looking at the sky from the bottom of a well, one will always feel that they are doing well, and as a result, stagnation is inevitable. Through comparison, problems can be discovered, efforts can be stimulated, and higher peaks can be climbed.

However, how to compare is also a question worth exploring. The news from the Beijing Lifting Machinery Plant published in today's newspaper provides us with some good experience. Every month, this factory distributes the advanced indicators of other factories and the factory's planned quotas to each workshop. Each workshop then fills in the advanced indicators of other factories and the factory's planned quotas for manufacturing each part and processing each process on the work order, and distributes them to each worker every day. This practice permeates the word "compare" into every worker's daily production activities, making "compare" a regular and mass work, which is very enlightening.

Whether the "compare" work is done well really depends to a large extent on whether it is compared regularly and whether it mobilizes everyone to compare. Production is always developing, especially in the era of the Great Leap Forward, where people chase after each other, and production records are changing rapidly. If it is not compared regularly, although one may not subjectively want to "close the door and call yourself king," it is easy to fall behind the situation without realizing it. Only by comparing regularly, comparing other people's advanced indicators with one's own planned quotas every month, and even every day, can the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses be continuously stimulated. Comparison cannot be limited to comparing the total indicators. The production plan of each enterprise is completed by the labor of every worker in the enterprise. Only comparing the total indicators still lacks advanced goals to strive for when it comes to the labor of each individual. Only when the manufacturing of each part and the processing of each process by each person are compared with the advanced level, is it possible to improve every link of production to the advanced level, and finally make the total indicators catch up with the advanced.

These are still only the methods of comparison. As for the content of comparison, it is also very worthy of discussion. What to compare? In short, it is: compare the advanced. The good and bad of production records, the high and low of planned indicators, the less and more of work quotas, etc., are all signs of advanced and backward, and must be compared. However, we cannot only compare records, only compare indicators, or only compare quotas. Production records, indicator quotas, are the results of production activities. Other people's advanced production records are the achievements of other people's production labor. Other people's advanced indicators and advanced quotas reflect other people's ambitions and their production level. When we compare, we must find out the reasons why they can create such advanced records, why they dare to propose such advanced indicators, and stipulate such advanced quotas. That is to say: comparing records, comparing indicators, and comparing quotas, we must also compare the technical and organizational measures in all aspects. See what measures others have adopted that we have not adopted, and what new technologies they have used that we have not used, so as to reach the advanced level. Only by comparing in such a detailed and in-depth manner can we compare a way to catch up with the advanced.

Now, the employees of various enterprises are discussing plans for increasing production and practicing economy. When discussing plans, it is also a time when comparison is particularly needed. Adopting the experience of the Beijing Lifting Machinery Plant, opening the door to mobilize every employee to compare with the advanced level in a detailed and in-depth manner, we can formulate a production increase and economy plan that has both advanced indicators and specific measures.

    “比、学、赶、帮”这四个字概括了增产节约劳动竞赛的一系列的活动；而其中的“比”字，又是这些活动中第一个重要的环节。通过比较，分出高低，然后才是后进的学先进、赶先进，先进的帮后进。不比，就无从学起，无从赶起，也无从帮起。
    “比”的方法，是一种鼓干劲、争上游的方法。上海有的工人提出一个口号：“不要关起门称大王”，就很说明了比的重要。不同别人比，关起门来，坐井观天，总会觉得自己很不错，结果就难免停滞不前。通过对比，才能发现问题，激励干劲，攀上更高的峰顶。
    然而，怎样比，也有很多值得探讨的问题。今天本报发表的北京起重机器厂的新闻，就给我们提供了一些很好的经验。这个厂每个月将外厂的先进指标和本厂的计划定额同时下达到各个车间，各个车间又每天将制造每个零件、加工每道工序的外厂的先进指标和本厂的计划定额，填写在工作任务单上，下达给每个工人。这种做法，把“比”字渗透到每一个工人每一天的生产活动中去，使“比”成为一种经常性的、群众性的工作，给人很大的启发。
    “比”的工作做得好不好，确实在很大程度上决定于是不是经常比，和是不是动员群众每个人都来比。生产总是不断发展的，特别是在大跃进的年代里，你追我赶，生产纪录日新月异。如果不是经常比，虽然主观上未必就想“关起门来称大王”却很容易落在形势的后面而不自觉。只有经常比，每个月、甚至每一天都把别人的先进指标同自己的计划定额来对比，才能不断地激发群众的革命干劲。比，又不能只限于比总的指标。每一个企业的生产计划，都是由企业里每一个工人的劳动来完成的。只比总的指标，具体到每一个人的劳动中，仍然缺乏先进的奋斗目标。只有每一个人的每一个零件的制造、每一道工序的加工，都同先进的水平作对比，才有可能把生产的每一个环节都提高到先进的水平，最后使总的指标赶上先进。
    这些，都还只是比的方法。至于比的内容，也是很值得探讨的。比什么？概言之，曰：比先进。生产纪录的好和差、计划指标的高和低、工时定额的少和多等等，都是先进和落后的标志，是要比的。然而，又不能只比纪录、只比指标、只比定额。生产纪录、指标定额，是生产活动的结果。别人的先进的生产纪录，是别人生产劳动的成绩。别人的先进指标、先进定额，反映了别人的雄心壮志和他们的生产水平。我们比的时候，要找出他们所以能够创造出这样先进的纪录、所以敢于提出这样先进的指标、规定这样先进的定额的原因。这就是说：比纪录、比指标、比定额，更要去比技术上的和组织上的各方面的措施。看看别人采用了哪些我们没有采用的措施，运用了哪些我们没有运用的新的技术，因而达到了先进的水平。这样细致地、深入地比，才能比出一条赶上先进的道路来。
    现在，各个企业的职工正在讨论增产节约的计划。讨论计划的时候，也是特别需要比的时候。采取北京起重机器厂的经验，敞开门来动员每一个职工细致地、深入地同先进的水平比，就能订出一个既有先进指标，又有具体措施的增产节约计划来。
