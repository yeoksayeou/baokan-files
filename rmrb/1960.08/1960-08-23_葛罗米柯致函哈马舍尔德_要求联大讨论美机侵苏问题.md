Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 21st: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko wrote to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on August 20th, requesting the inclusion of the issue of "The Threat to Universal Peace Posed by the Aggressive Acts of the United States Against the Soviet Union" on the agenda of the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Gromyko's letter was accompanied by an explanation. The explanation specifically pointed out that the US government, disregarding the principles and purposes of the United Nations, continues to implement the policy of US military aircraft violating Soviet airspace.

The explanation stated that the violation of the Soviet Union's borders and sovereignty by US military aircraft, another member of the United Nations, is a direct act of aggression. The explanation then listed relevant materials.

The explanation said that the July 1st violation of the Soviet border by a US bomber proves that the US government continues to follow that dangerous path. The United States continues to use military bases established in other countries—territories of US allies—to carry out dangerous provocations against the Soviet Union, which further exacerbates the seriousness of the situation.

The document stated that the Soviet government hopes that the United Nations General Assembly will take appropriate measures.

    葛罗米柯致函哈马舍尔德
    要求联大讨论美机侵苏问题
    据新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科21日讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在8月20日写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，要求在联合国大会第十五届会议的议程中列入“关于美国对苏联的侵略行为对普遍和平所造成的威胁”的问题。
    葛罗米柯的信中并附有说明。说明中特别指出，美国政府无视联合国的原则和宗旨，继续执行美国军用飞机侵犯苏联领空的政策。
    说明中说，美国军用飞机侵犯另一个联合国会员国，即苏联的国界和主权，这是直接的侵略行为。说明中接着列举了有关材料。
    说明中说，美国轰炸机7月1日破坏苏联国界证明，美国政府继续走着那条危险的道路。美国继续利用它在其他国家——美国的盟国领土上建立的军事基地对苏联进行危险的挑衅，这也使局势的严重性更加加深。
    文件中说，苏联政府希望联合国大会采取适当的措施。
