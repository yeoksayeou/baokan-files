	Your Shoes Are Here!

	A wake-up bugle call broke the pre-dawn silence. The comrades of the First Platoon of the artillery unit put on their clothes and saw that their shoes were gone. Everyone was very surprised.

	"Comrades, your shoes are here!" Aunt Qi, the landlady, came over with a pile of shoes at this moment.

	It turned out that an artillery company of a certain unit was stationed in Xigou Village to perform a firewood-gathering mission. The comrades' shoes were soaked by the snow on the mountain, and they made a "squish," "squish" sound when they walked. Aunt Qi, the landlady of the First Platoon, saw that the comrades were wearing wet shoes every day, going out early and returning late to gather firewood on the mountain, and thought, "The comrades are very tired from working all day, it must be even more difficult to wear wet shoes!" She waited until the comrades were all asleep and took all the wet shoes to her room. She was afraid that the shoes would not dry by dawn, so she turned the shoes over for a while, moved them around for a while, until the rooster was about to crow for the first time and she saw that the shoes were gradually drying, then she lay down on the kang. Just then, she heard the comrades getting up, and she quickly rolled over and got up to bring the shoes. Everyone was overjoyed to see that Aunt Qi had dried all the shoes. Aunt Qi smiled with relief as she watched them put on their dry shoes.

    你们的鞋在这呢！
    一阵起床哨声，打破了黎明前的寂静。炮一班的同志们穿好衣服一看，鞋不见了，大家都很奇怪。
    “同志，你们的鞋在这呢！”房东祁大嫂，这时抱了一堆鞋过来了。
    原来，某部炮连执行打柴任务住在西沟村，大伙的鞋被山上的积雪浸湿了，走起路来“呱唧”“呱唧”直响。一班的房东祁大嫂，见同志们每天都穿着湿鞋，早出晚归上山打柴，就想：“同志们一天干活挺累的，穿湿鞋该多遭罪呀！”她等同志们都睡着时，将所有的湿鞋都拿到她屋去了。她怕天亮鞋烤不干，一晚上一会儿把鞋翻一翻，一会儿挪挪地方，直到鸡快叫头遍看鞋渐渐烤干，她才躺在炕上。正在这时，他听见同志们起床了，连忙翻身爬起来，把鞋送来。大伙见祁大嫂把鞋都给烤干了，高兴得不得了。祁大嫂看他们穿上了干鞋，放心的笑了。
