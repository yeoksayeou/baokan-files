Xinhua News Agency, Jinan - The vast number of workers on the Shandong transportation front are breaking through key problems, improving transportation efficiency, and determined to support the sustained leap forward in steel production with high-level transportation.

The staff of various stations and sections under the Jinan Railway Bureau, on the basis of winning high production in July, launched a high-quality, high-yield movement centered on safety, punctuality, and quality, and achieved remarkable results. From August 1st to 3rd, the daily loading volume of coal was 25 wagons more than in late July; key materials such as ore, coke, and pig iron were also transported upon arrival and without deduction by weight. Responding positively to the call of the Party, the staff of each station and section conscientiously implemented the method of "changing cargo flow and assigning points to mines," and vigorously tackled major key production problems. Aiming at the key production problems such as the non-uniform flow of coal from small and large mines, the Zhangdian Railway Office vigorously promoted station-mine cooperation, and transformed scattered cargo flows into direct cargo flows according to the train flow requirements, ensuring the departure of whole trains and effectively improving transportation efficiency.

The staff of local transportation departments have established the idea that man can conquer nature and are doing everything possible to overcome the rainy season to ensure the transportation of key materials such as steel and coal. From August 1st to 3rd, the province's freight truck tonnage output increased by more than 44% compared with the same period in July. The Weifang Transportation Bureau flexibly mobilized vehicles according to the weather, transporting coke and ore on rainy days, and rushing to transport ore powder on sunny days; the workers of the Sixth Automobile Team of the Yantai Prefectural Transportation Bureau rushed to transport branch line materials on good days and concentrated vehicles on the main lines for transportation on rainy days. These measures have delivered a large amount of ore and coke to the blast furnaces, ensuring the needs of steel production.

The 627 kilometers of local railways that have been built and officially opened to traffic in Shandong have played a huge role in supporting steel production. The Dongfeng Station, affiliated to the Jinan Local Railway Company, flexibly applied many of the effective management experiences of large railways to small railways. By strengthening the maintenance of locomotives, vehicles, and lines, the perfect vehicle rate has been increased from 30% to more than 80%. They have strengthened the management of small railways by using the "train operation diagram," "operation plan," scheduled transportation, and handover system of large railways, and established and improved the necessary rules and regulations. As a result, the daily transportation volume of the entire station has increased from 380 tons to 560 tons, and the highest has reached more than 1,000 tons, which has powerfully guaranteed the production of relevant iron factories in Jinan.

    山东运输部门大破关键力争多运钢厂“粮草”
    铁路部门大搞路矿协作汽车司机灵活迎战雨季地方铁路加强养护维修
    新华社济南电　山东交通运输战线广大职工，大破关键提高运输效率，决心以高运保高产，进一步支援钢铁生产持续跃进。
    济南铁路局所属各站、段职工在夺得7月高产的基础上，开展了一个以安全、准点、质量为中心的优质高产运动，取得了显著成绩。8月1日到3日的煤炭日装车量，就比7月下旬多二十五辆；矿石、焦炭、生铁等重点物资，也作到了随到随运，斤两不压。各站、段职工积极响应党的号召，认真贯彻执行了“货流改道、分矿包点”的办法，猛攻生产重大关键。张店铁路办事处针对小窑煤、大井煤货流不统一等生产关键问题，大搞站矿合作，根据列车流向的要求，把零散的货流变为直接货流，保证了整列出车，有效地提高了运输效率。
    地方交通运输部门的职工树立了人定胜天的思想，千方百计地战胜雨季，保证钢铁煤炭等重点物资的运输。8月1日到3日，全省货运汽车车吨产量比7月同期提高44％以上。潍坊市交通局根据天气情况灵活调动车辆，雨天装运焦炭、矿石，晴天抢运矿粉；烟台专署交通局第六汽车队职工好天抢运支线物资，雨天把车辆集中到干线上运输。采取这些办法都为高炉运送了大量矿石、焦炭，保证了钢铁生产的需要。
    山东各地已经建成并正式通车的六百二十七公里地方铁路，在支援钢铁生产中发挥了巨大作用。济南地方铁路公司所属东风车站把许多大铁路行之有效的管理经验，灵活地运用到小铁路上来，通过加强机车、车辆和线路的养护维修，使完好车率由30％提高到80％以上。他们由于运用了大铁路的“列车运行图”、“作业计划”、定时运输、交接班制度等经验，加强了小铁路的管理工作，建立健全了必要的规章制度，从而使全站的日运量由三百八十吨提高到五百六十吨，最高达到一千吨以上，有力地保证了济南有关铁厂的生产。
