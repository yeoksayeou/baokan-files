According to Tianjin Daily: Leaders of the Tianjin Shoe Factory went deep into workshops and teams, adopting the method of assigning responsibility by area, seeing things through to the end, practically and one-by-one resolving specific problems in the promotion of new technologies and processes, rapidly and effectively applying the fruits of the technical revolution to production, achieving universal flowering and bearing fruit. 96.2% of the factory's innovation projects have been promoted and used, freeing more than six hundred shoe-making workers from heavy manual labor. On the basis of comprehensively overfulfilling the state plan in the first half of the year, the factory comprehensively overfulfilled its daily plan in July, with average daily output increasing by 8% compared with June, the rate of first-class products reaching 100%, and the consumption of raw materials per pair of shoes also significantly reduced.

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations," the workers created more than five hundred various types of shoe-making machines, which played a great role in changing the backward production situation of manual operation. However, some machines, after successful testing, were not able to be used normally in production. This problem immediately attracted the attention of the factory's Party committee. The Party committee secretary personally went to the machine platform, talked with the workers, understood the reasons why the machines could not be used, and found that some were because the machines themselves were not perfect enough, and some were because the workers were not skilled enough in operation. Therefore, the factory's Party committee secretary, factory director, and other leading cadres went to the workshops to "settle down," focusing on key projects of key teams, laboring and discussing with the workers, analyzing one by one the reasons why innovation projects could not be used normally. While analyzing, discussing, and improving, they also mobilized the masses to launch a debate on "Is it better to further improve the innovation project and put it into production, or to return to manual labor from machine production?" establishing in the minds of the workers the concept of resolutely applying innovation results to production. Subsequently, cadres and workers were organized to summarize the innovation results, and the existing specific problems were solved one by one practically, so that the results of technical innovation were effectively reflected in indicators such as output, quality, variety, and consumption.

In the process of leading cadres going deep into the front line of production and focusing on the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of the "four modernizations" results, the factory launched a heated "three guarantees, two checks, and one follow-through to the end" competition among the masses. For every innovation proposal put forward, the innovator, with the support and help of the Party committee, guarantees manufacturing, guarantees testing, and guarantees promotion; checks whether product output has increased, checks the quality of the product, and at the same time follows through until the machine has no problems and the workers can master it. This competition closely combines innovators and users, speeds up the successful trial production of "four modernizations" projects, quickly discovers problems, quickly solves problems, and quickly promotes them, enabling each innovation to be put into production, "hitting one and landing one."

### 领导工作越做越细　革新成果越结越大  天津制鞋厂新技术新工艺普遍开花结果

    领导工作越做越细　革新成果越结越大
    天津制鞋厂新技术新工艺普遍开花结果
    据天津日报消息：　天津制鞋厂领导干部深入车间、小组，采取分片包干，一包到底的方法，切切实实地、一个一个地解决推广新技术、新工艺当中的具体问题，把技术革命成果迅速而有成效地运用于生产，做到普遍开花结果。这个厂96.2％的革新项目已经推广使用，使六百多制鞋工人摆脱了笨重手工劳动。全厂在上半年全面超额完成国家计划的基础上，7月份按日全面超额完成计划，平均日产量比6月份提高了8％，正品率达到100％，每双鞋的原料消耗也显著降低。
    在以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动中，职工们创造了五百多台各式各样的制鞋机，对于改变手工操作的落后生产面貌起了很大的作用。但是，有些机器试验成功以后，没有能够正常地用到生产上去。这个问题立即引起了厂党委的注意，党委书记亲自到机台前，和工人谈心，了解机器不能使用的原因，发现有些是机器本身还不够完善，有些是工人操作还不够熟练。于是，这个厂的党委书记、厂长等领导干部，就分片包干，到车间“安家落户”，以狠抓重点小组的关键项目为主，和工人同劳动，同商量，一起逐件分析革新项目不能正常使用的原因。边分析、边议论、边改进，并且发动群众就“使革新项目进一步完善投入生产好，还是从机器生产退回到手工好呢？”展开了鸣放辩论，在职工中树立起坚决把革新成果用于生产的观念。接着，又组织干部和工人一起总结了革新成果，把存在的一些具体问题逐项地切切实实加以解决，使技术革新成果切实反映到产量、质量、品种、消耗等指标上来。
    在领导干部深入生产第一线，狠抓“四化”成果的巩固、推广、提高过程中，这个厂在群众中又掀起了火热的“三包两看一跟到底”的竞赛活动，凡是每件革新建议提出后，革新者在党委支持和帮助下，包制造、包试验、包推广；看产品产量是否上去了，看产品质量高低，同时一直跟到机器没有毛病，工人能掌握为止。这种竞赛，使革新者和使用者密切结合，使“四化”项目试制成功快，发现问题快，解决问题快，推广快，能使项项革新投入生产，“打一个落一个”。
