    Guantian Arsenal
    Wu Hanjie
    Every time I visit a factory, I can't help but think of our Red Army's Guantian Arsenal.
    In the early days of the Red Army's founding, where would we find an arsenal? Our weapons were all seized from the enemy. Every time we fought a battle, we captured so many weapons that we couldn't even carry them all. At this time, we had to remove the bolts of the guns and put them in our pockets. If there were too many, we strung them together and carried them on our backs. The gun barrels were carried by prisoners or the local people. Once the guns were separated like this, it became troublesome to bring them back. Either the parts didn't match, or the bolt handles were incomplete, making them unusable without repair. After 1931, the scale of the war grew larger and larger, and the Red Army continued to develop, requiring even more weapons. Chiang Kai-shek, this "transport captain," sent us so many guns, but he didn't send us a single repair shop. Therefore, we had to do it ourselves.
    In September of that year, the Red Army smashed the enemy's third "encirclement and suppression" campaign, and in the final battle annihilated Han Deqin's troops, capturing a large number of guns. The Central Revolutionary Military Commission ordered me to collect guns in Baishi, Xingguo, and prepare to establish a repair shop. I was an amateur and a little worried, but since we were making a revolution, we had to do even the most difficult things.
    I led six or seven workers, with a few files and pliers, and the repair shop was set up. In less than twenty days, we collected five or six thousand old rifles and repaired some of them. Then, the Military Commission ordered us to merge with the repair shops of the Jiangxi Soviet Government and the Third Army Corps; this became the Central Military Commission Arsenal, established in Guantian, Liantang District, Xingguo County, in October.
    After the merger of the three factories, the number of managers and workers increased to about two hundred and fifty. The number of tools also increased more than twenty times: more than two hundred files, more than one hundred pliers, and four blacksmithing furnaces. However, these tools were difficult to use. The most difficult thing was the lack of technology. Our workers were mostly farmers not long ago, and there were also carpenters and blacksmiths, and some who had previously been quartermasters in the Kuomintang army. Most people had not repaired guns, and many had not even touched a gun. Now, to ask them to repair various guns was simply too difficult.
    Despite the many difficulties in front of us, no one said they couldn't do it. At that time, I was with the worker brothers every day. When we talked about the technical difficulties, they always smiled and said:
  "Just learn hard!" Some even joked, "Factory Director, as I see it, we can learn anything except how to give birth."
    Because everyone had the desire to master technology, a wave of learning technology was set off throughout the factory. I discussed with everyone and allocated the workforce, letting those who knew technology teach those who didn't. Everyone was determined to teach and learn well, and put forward the slogan: "Learn humbly, learn quickly, we sweat more, and our class brothers shed less blood!" At this time, it was the twelfth lunar month, and the cold wind was blowing, but everyone seemed to have forgotten the cold. During the day, they dropped their bowls and ran to work; at night, without lights, they studied the technology in the dark; when they went to bed, they still discussed how to find the trick.
    Soon, everyone finally mastered the preliminary technology. Batches of repaired rifles were sent to the front line, and we felt unspeakably happy. However, trouble followed. Many of the repaired guns were unusable. When fired, either the extractor hook broke, or the firing pin snapped. Everyone looked at the returned waste products, feeling anxious and burning with impatience. If the guns were not repaired well, it would affect the Red Army's combat effectiveness, which was a disgrace to our workers. On this day, the food had been served for a long time, but many workers didn't come to eat. I ran to the workshop and saw them all repairing the returned broken guns with a clanging sound! When they saw me, they all clamored: "Factory Director, we don't feel like eating if we don't fix the broken guns!" It took me a while to persuade them to go and eat.
    After the meal, I carefully inspected the returned weapons with everyone, and finally found the problem: the heat hadn't been properly controlled. Later, I asked experienced workers to demonstrate for everyone, and also soaked the manufactured parts in a kind of potion after they were heated red, and then used them. The machine head parts made in this way worked. In order to improve product quality, we also formulated a product inspection system. From then on, everyone not only found the trick, but also recognized their own strength from the initial achievements, and had greater enthusiasm for work and stronger confidence in overcoming difficulties.
    The repaired guns were sent to the front line again, and after practical testing, they were all usable. As the news of victories from the front line came, we thought that in these victorious battles, many soldiers were using the guns we repaired to strike at the enemy, and we felt an unspeakable joy.
    In December 1931, the Red Army eliminated several local tyrants and evil gentry entrenched in Xunwu and Huichang counties, and recruited more than thirty gun repair workers. In April 1932, the Red Army captured Zhangzhou in Fujian, and also seized the enemy Zhang Zhen's repair shop, mobilizing more than twenty workers to come to the factory, and also brought two lathes, a thirty-horsepower generator, a blower, a batch of gasoline and raw materials, etc. We quickly installed the machines. The machines roared into operation, and everyone jumped up with joy, and the villagers who came to watch the excitement also cheered, "The Red Army arsenal has machines!" Then, the Party transferred Comrades Han Risheng and Hao Xiying, underground members from the Shenyang Arsenal, all of whom were skilled technicians. At this time, the factory's technology greatly improved, and the organizational structure was also adjusted, and a machine group, a repair group, a blacksmith group, a carpentry group, and a leather group were established. From then on, we could not only repair rifles, but also repair machine guns, mortars, and Mauser pistols, and even make our own rifles.
    After smashing the enemy's third "encirclement and suppression" campaign, the troops actively consolidated and expanded the Soviet area, and battles were frequent, requiring not only guns, but also an urgent need for bullets. In January 1932, the Military Commission ordered us to establish a bullet factory in the arsenal.
    We accepted this task and immediately began preparations, recruiting workers. Without technicians, we sent people to the bullet factory in the Western Fujian Soviet Area to learn bullet-making technology. They not only taught the four people we sent, but also gave us four technicians. Lacking raw materials, we sent people to purchase them everywhere. When the local people heard that the Red Army was going to make its own bullets, they sent the bullet casings they had picked up from the battlefield to the bullet factory. Soon, we collected more than 200,000 catties of bullet casings. In addition, we also set up secret purchasing stations in Dabu, Fujian, and near Ganzhou and Ji'an, Jiangxi, to purchase white medicine (foreign saltpeter), nitric acid, and cotton for making gunpowder, and copper skin and male essence for making bullet primers, and collected broken copperware and copper coins in the Soviet area as raw materials for bullet heads, and made our own bullet-making tools, such as iron drills, iron hammers, and files.
    Everything was ready. In March, when the spring was warm and the flowers were blooming, the bullet factory started work.
    We made the first batch of bullets and ran excitedly into the mountains to test them, but the results were disappointing: some of the bullets went sideways as soon as they left the barrel, were inaccurate, and didn't go far, and also damaged the rifling of the gun.
    This made everyone anxious. We carefully studied the bullets, looking for problems, and even thought about the problems with the bullets while eating and walking. Finally, we figured it out. It turned out that the bullet heads were cast from copper and rounded and polished by hand. The filing skills were not skilled, the bullet heads were of different sizes, and some were not straight, and there was no strict inspection. So we made bullet head models and checked them one by one, which greatly improved the situation and made them as usable as the bullets made in the Western Fujian Soviet Area. Later, the workers suggested that the bullet heads should not be cast from copper, but made of copper coins stamped into round shells, filled with lead and tin, which further improved the quality. The comrades at the front were satisfied and said: "The bullets we make ourselves are no worse than the White Army's foreign bullets!"
    However, difficulties followed: the enemy's blockade of the Soviet area became tighter and tighter, and we couldn't buy oil, so the machines couldn't start. But these two machines were necessary for us to repair large parts of guns and cannons, and they were also the master machines for making hand tools in the bullet factory, so we couldn't let them stop. So we built a large wooden wheel and used water power to start it. We couldn't buy nitric acid, an important raw material for making bullets, so we tried to grind rotten wood into powder and mix it with white medicine to make gunpowder. After testing, the effectiveness of the bullets was not reduced, but the cost was greatly reduced. When the copper skin for making primers ran out, we used bullet casings to make thin copper sheets to replace them. In this way, the bullets we re-made were still supplied to the front line in batches and in a timely manner.
    At this time, the arsenal managed two factories, one was a gun repair factory and the other was a bullet factory. The bullet factory also had more than two hundred workers, all young men and women from the Soviet area. In order to support the Red Army in winning battles and eliminating the enemy, they worked hard and studied bullet-making seriously, and proposed a competition with the workers of the gun repair factory. The workers of the two factories were working selflessly to supply the Red Army with guns, cannons, and ammunition, just like the soldiers at the front fighting the enemy.
    One day in May, I conveyed the order from the higher authorities to make grenades and landmines. Everyone was very interested in this new "order". The raw materials were pig iron and earth saltpeter, which were abundant in the Central Soviet Area, and we quickly collected a large pile of them, and immediately started to cast bullet casings and make gunpowder, filled the bullet casings with gunpowder, and mixed in some iron scraps, and installed ignition devices. In a few days, the first batch of grenades and landmines left the factory. After testing by the inspection team, a landmine weighing more than twenty catties could break or injure trees within a radius of three zhang. Everyone's mood was even higher. So we recruited a large number of workers who used to cast pots, workers who could make earth gunpowder, and carpenters, etc., and expanded the factory building. From then on, grenades (with wooden handles and hemp rope) and landmines became the focus of our bullet factory.
    Our Red Army's Guantian Arsenal, under the leadership of the Party, coupled with the workers' revolutionary enthusiasm, everyone used their brains and hands to overcome difficulties, and thus was built from scratch, from small to large. We made a total of more than 40,000 rifles, more than 400,000 bullets, repaired more than 2,000 machine guns, more than 100 mortars, 2 mountain guns, and made more than 60,000 grenades and more than 5,000 landmines. These weapons and ammunition equipped the Red Army and severely struck the enemy.

    官田兵工厂
    吴汉杰
    我每次参观工厂，就禁不住想起我们的红军官田兵工厂。
    在红军初建的那些艰苦日子里，哪有兵工厂呢？我们的武器都是从敌人那里缴来的。每打一次仗，缴获的武器总是拿都拿不了。这时候，只好把枪机卸下来，装在衣兜里，多了就串起来背上，枪杆叫俘虏或老乡扛下来。枪枝这样一分家，拿回来可就麻烦了，不是配搭不上，便是机柄零件残缺不全，不修理是不能用的。1931年以后，战争的规模越来越大，红军队伍也不断地发展，需要的武器就更多了。蒋介石这个“运输大队长”，给我们送来这么多的枪，却没有送给我们一座修械厂。于是，我们只好自己动手了。
    这年9月，红军粉碎敌人第三次“围剿”，最后一仗歼灭了韩德勤部，缴获了大批枪枝。中央革命军事委员会命令我去兴国的白石收集枪枝，并筹备建立修械厂。我是个外行，有点发愁，但是闹革命嘛，再难的事也得干。
    我领着六、七个工人，带着几把锉刀、钳子，修械厂就算办起来了。不到二十天，收集了五、六千枝破旧步枪，还修好了一部分。接着，军委命令我们与江西省苏维埃政府的和三军团的修械所合并；这就是10月里在兴国县莲塘区官田成立的中央军委兵工厂。
    三个厂一合并，管理人员和工人增加到了二百五十来人。工具也多了二十多倍；二百多把锉刀，一百多把老虎钳子，四座打铁炉。可是这些家什用起来很不得手。尤其困难的是没有技术。我们的工人不久前还大都是农民，也有木匠、铁匠，还有的原来在国民党部队当军需，多数人没有修过枪，甚至不少人还没有摸过枪哩，现在要他们修理各种枪枝，简直困难极了。
    尽管摆在我们面前的困难这么多，但谁也没有说干不了。当时，我天天跟工人弟兄在一起，谈起技术的困难，他们总是笑迷迷地说：
  “好好学呗！”有的还打趣说：“厂长呀，依我看哪，除了生孩子，咱们啥都能学会。”
    由于大家都有掌握技术的要求，一个学技术的热潮在全厂掀起来了。我跟大家一起商量，把力量配搭开来，让懂技术的人教不会的人。大家都抱定决心，好好教，好好学，并提出口号：“虚心学、快快学，我们多流汗，阶级弟兄少流血！”这时正是十冬腊月，寒风呼呼地吹，但大家好像忘掉了寒冷，白天，丢下饭碗，就跑去干活；夜里没有灯，就摸着黑研究技术；躺上床了，还讨论着怎样找窍门。
    不久，大家终于掌握了初步的技术。修好的步枪，一批又一批地送上了前线，我们心里真有说不出的高兴。可是，麻烦的事也跟着找上门来了。修理过的枪，有好多不能用，一打，不是抓子钩坏了，就是撞针断了。大家看着退回来的废品，心里急得火烧火燎的。枪修不好，影响了红军的战斗，这是我们工人的耻辱。这天，饭菜端上好久，很多工人没来吃。我跑到工作室一看，都在叮叮当当地修理退回来的破枪哩！他们见了我都吵吵嚷嚷：“厂长，不把坏枪修好，吃饭都不香！”我好容易才劝他们吃饭去了。
    饭后，我跟大家仔细检查了退回来的武器，终于把毛病找出来了：原来是火候没有掌握好。以后，我就叫有经验的工人，做样子给大家看，还把制成的零件烧红后，在一种药水里浸一下，然后使用。这样制成的机头零件就管用了。为了提高产品质量，我们还制定了产品检查制度。从此，大家不但摸到了窍门，而且还从初步的成绩中认识到了自己的力量，工作的劲头更大，克服困难的信心更强了。
    修好的枪，又送到了前线，经过实用证明，全部合用了。随着前线的胜利消息传来，我们想到在这些胜利的战斗中，有不少战士使用着我们修理的枪械在打击敌人时，真有一种说不出的愉快。
    1931年12月，红军消灭了寻邬和会昌两县几个土豪劣绅盘据的白点，征集了三十多名修枪工人。1932年4月，红军攻克了福建的漳州，又缴获了敌人张贞部的修械厂，动员了二十多名工人来厂，还带来了两个车床、一个三十马力的发电机、一个鼓风机、一批汽油和原材料等。我们很快把机器安装好。机器轰?轰?地开动了，大家都高兴得跳起来，来看热闹的老乡们也欢天喜地地嚷着“红军兵工厂有机器了”。接着，党又从沈阳兵工厂调来了地下党员韩日升、郝希英等三个同志，他们都是熟练的技工。这时，工厂的技术大大进步了，组织机构也调整了，成立了机器组、修配组、打铁组、木工组、皮革组。从此，我们不但能修理步枪，就是修理机枪、迫击炮、驳壳枪也不成问题了，甚至可以自己造步枪了。
    粉碎敌人第三次“围剿”后，部队积极巩固和扩展苏区，战斗频繁，不仅需要枪，而且也迫切地需要子弹。1932年1月，军委命令我们在兵工厂中建立一所造弹厂。
    我们接受了这个任务，当即进行筹备，招收工人。没有技术人员，就派人到闽西苏区造弹厂去学习造弹技术。他们不但教会了我们派去的四个人，还给了我们四个技术工人。缺乏原料，就派人四出收购。当地群众听说红军要自己造子弹了，纷纷把从战场上捡来的弹壳，送到造弹厂。不久，我们就收集了二十多万斤弹壳。另外，又在福建的大埔、江西的赣州、吉安近郊，设立了秘密采购站，购买做火药用的白药（洋硝）、硝酸、棉花和做子弹底火用的铜皮与雄精，并在苏区内收集破铜器、铜钱，作为弹头原料，自己打造弹工具，如铁钻、铁锤、锉刀等。
    一切筹备好了。春暖花开的三月天，造弹厂开工了。
    我们造出了第一批子弹，兴冲冲地跑进山林里试验，可是结果却使人大为扫兴：有一部分子弹弹头出了枪膛就横着身走，打不准又打不远，还损伤枪的来复线。
    这下可把大家急得够受。我们拿着子弹仔细研究，找毛病，甚至连吃饭、走路也想着子弹的毛病。终于弄明白了，原来弹头是铜铸成又经手工锉圆锉光的，锉工不熟练，弹头大小不一，还有不端正的，也没有严格检查，于是我们做了弹头模型，逐一检查，这样就大有进步，和闽西苏区造的子弹一样可用了。后来工人献计，弹头不用铜铸，改用铜币冲成圆壳，内灌铅锡，质量更提高了。前方同志们满意地说：“我们自己造的子弹也不比白军的洋子弹差哩！”
    可是，困难又跟着来了：敌人对苏区的封锁越来越紧，我们买不到油，机器不能发动，但这两部机器是我们修枪炮大零件必需的，又是造弹厂制造手工工具的母机，不能让它停着。我们就造了个大木轮，利用水力来发动。造子弹的重要原料——硝酸买不到了，我们就设法用腐朽的木头，磨成粉末，和白药配成火药。经试验，子弹的效力没有减低，反而大大降低了成本。做底火的铜皮用光了，我们就用弹壳打成薄铜片来代替，就这样，我们翻造的子弹，仍旧一批一批及时地供应了前线。
    这时兵工厂管两个厂，一个是修枪厂，一个是造弹厂。造弹厂也有二百多工人，都是苏区的青年男女。他们为了支援红军打胜仗，消灭敌人，做工的劲头大，学习造弹也认真，提出与修枪厂工人比赛。两厂的工人为了供应红军的枪炮弹药而忘我地劳动着，像前方战士们和敌人战斗一样。
    5月的一天，我传达了上级要我们造手雷和地雷的命令。大家对这种新的“定货”很有兴趣。原料是生铁和土硝，中央苏区内很多，很快就收集了一大堆，马上开工铸弹壳、造火药，在弹壳内装上火药，还杂些碎铁片，安上发火机。几天功夫，第一批手雷和地雷出厂了。经检查组试验，一颗二十多斤重的地雷，可以把周围三丈远的树木炸断或炸伤。大家情绪更高。于是又招收大批原来会铸锅的工人，会造土火药的工人和木工等，并且扩大了厂房。从这以后，手雷（有木柄的和马尾的）和地雷就成为我们造弹厂的突击对象了。
    我们红军官田兵工厂，在党的领导下，加上工人的革命热情，大家用脑用手克服困难，就这样从无到有、从小到大地建设起来。我们一共配制了四万多支步枪、四十多万发子弹，修理了两千多挺机枪、百多门迫击炮、两门山炮，造了六万多枚手雷、五千多个地雷。这些武器弹药，装备了红军，狠狠地打击了敌人。
