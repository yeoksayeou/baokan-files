New York Letter
United States, William Smith

    A friend from afar wrote to me, saying, "Tell me about life in America! The more I read books about America, the more confused I become. Of course, I'm not from Mars, but America really baffles me. Please write to me!" The letter talked about many other things, but the above paragraph was the main point.

    Since he is a good friend of mine, I will try to satisfy his request. We met during World War II. In American terms, we got along famously. But where to begin? With the Native American Indians who lived in America before the arrival of the white man? I often think of starting the American story with the Indians and their experiences after the white man brought them "civilization." Should I start with the Revolution of 1776? That revolution freed us from the tyranny of King George. But considering the American government's view of revolution today, I don't think that's a good place to start. Where exactly should I begin? With the Civil War that freed the slaves, or with the two World Wars that bled the world and made billionaires rich?

    Being a straightforward person, I replied to him directly with the following letter:

    Life in America today would probably surprise someone from Mars. But I think it's not surprising that residents of other places on Earth might be as bewildered by America as interstellar beings. I know that this is not glorious for America. I feel sad. Why? Listen!

    America has a population of 180 million. We are descendants of people from all over the world. I love my country and its hardworking people. They are hardworking and enterprising. In my forty-plus years of traveling across my homeland, I have seen imagination and courage. But I also know that we are not a happy nation, especially in the last decade or two. The main spokespersons of the United States say that we are the richest people in the world, and that Americans own more cars, washing machines, dishwashers, electric appliances, bathrooms, refrigerators, and televisions than the residents of other countries. That is correct. But despite these things... Take my friend George as an example. There are millions of people like George!

    George works in a steel mill in Pittsburgh. In America, people often say that steel is the leading industry. George is a veteran of World War II. He fought in the war that defeated Hitler and was an excellent tank driver. We know each other very well. After returning home, George married a beautiful girl named Alice and had two children. From 1946 until now, George has been working hard. He and Alice saved some money and bought a house. They paid three thousand dollars at once, and the remaining ten thousand dollars were paid in installments to the real estate company. I have been to George's house many times. The house has four rooms, plus a bathroom and a small lawn. Alice also has a refrigerator. However, despite having these electrical appliances, she is still busy all day long. George and his wife are thrifty and managed to buy this neat little house in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. A few days ago, I received a telegram from George and went to visit them. George is my comrade-in-arms, and we have been through hard battles and hardships together. But I have never seen him so worried.

    When I walked into the house, George forced a smile to welcome me. But when we sat down for a chat in a small hotel, I knew what had happened. This is a story of modern America.

    George didn't go to work. He hasn't been to work for ten months. He said, "This situation is driving me crazy."

    They bought the house five years ago. George said with a wry smile, "Buying" is not the right word to use. The monthly installments were causing them distress. They also bought a "Ford" car on credit, paying five hundred dollars as the first payment, and the remaining two thousand four hundred dollars were also paid in monthly installments. They also bought a television set on credit, paying seventy-five dollars as the first payment, and the remaining two hundred and fifty dollars were paid in monthly installments.

    Even so, George worked steadily, and when he wasn't unemployed ten months ago, they barely managed to meet their various expenses. George said, "At this time, I had already discovered that I belonged to various companies. The real estate company owned part of me, and the Ford Motor Company and Westinghouse each owned other parts of me." Every ounce of George's energy was used to cope with the monthly installment plans. Installment payments became the master of George's life. He was exhausted and running around to deal with the installment collectors, doing monotonous and rigid work, without even having time to read, and George was originally a person who liked to read. George rarely went out to the movies or to the theater in the city because he couldn't afford tickets, and the installment collectors and tax collectors came to collect their bills as accurately as the tide rises and falls. As long as they had money in hand, they were polite and smiling. In order to ensure timely payment, George used his only bit of spare time—every evening—to do other jobs, earning a few extra dollars. Alice also worked part-time in a department store. George and Alice hardly had any time together. During the day, everyone went to work, had a hurried dinner, and then there was evening work. Alice was also very tired when she returned home from the department store. George said, "My family life is ruined too!"

    However, when George wasn't unemployed, they could still maintain. But steel production began to decline. Current production is less than 50% of capacity. People lost their jobs. George, who had worked for fifteen years and was "the luckiest," also received a layoff notice. At the time, he was still hoping that he would return to work soon. But the days passed quickly, and George had to go to the unemployment assistance office to receive forty-five dollars a week in unemployment benefits, which was less than half of his income during his working period. He began to fall behind on his installment payments. Then, six months passed, the unemployment benefits ran out, and soon, George's savings, which he had prepared for bad days, were also used up.

    "What do I do now?" he asked anxiously. His eyes looked around, as if looking for a way to escape reality. I felt pain looking at his pained face.

    If he can't find the money to make monthly installment payments, George will soon lose his house, and the real estate company will take the house back. The Ford Motor Company's car collector is also warning him, and the television store is also making it difficult for him. What to do?

    I told you George's story. George is unemployed. I don't want to give the impression that most Americans are unemployed. However, there are about five million unemployed people in the United States. They are mostly workers in the steel and automobile manufacturing industries. All Americans are worried that one day, perhaps tomorrow, unemployment will befall them, and all Americans feel threatened by installment collectors.

    The most important thing for the American people is the lack of security. We don't know what to do after we lose our jobs. Our unemployment benefits only last for six months. What happens after six months? It is really shameful to receive "relief" that is akin to charity. But the unemployed have to go to the municipal government office on time to receive relief food—some cheese and potatoes, and sometimes they don't even get that.

    We learned from a recent social welfare workers' conference that in hospitals, one in five hospitalized patients is mentally ill. In our "richest country in the world, the number of mentally ill patients is the highest." George said, "This situation is driving me crazy!" There are millions of people like George. The most fundamental reason is the lack of security and the inability to repay installment debts. In fact, we don't belong to ourselves. We belong to various powerful companies and monopolies. These large companies and monopolies are the owners of houses, cars, refrigerators, and almost everything.

    These owners of America not only occupy the labor of the American people, but they also occupy the souls of the American people. In the last twenty-five years, the cultural and political climate in America has deteriorated rapidly, like a car running down a slope with failed brakes. Before the installment collector takes the television set away from George, the television programs that George's family can watch are some extremely vulgar and low-level things. Every night there are our so-called "fighting" programs, western cowboys shooting Indians; during the day, these programs are on five or six times... bandits shooting police, police killing bandits... and so on. This is our daily culture, and it also reflects a political reality: the American government is eager to use atomic bombs. The United States has repeatedly refused to reach an agreement with socialist countries on banning nuclear war, and the United States spends 45 billion US dollars every year to expand its military and prepare for war. Arms merchants are becoming increasingly wealthy, and the American people are becoming increasingly poor. The more money spent on weapons of murder, the less funding is spent on schools, hospitals, pensions, housing, and other measures to improve living standards.

    Friend, I am telling you these things that worry me with a heavy heart.

    Seventy-five years ago, Emerson warned the American people that "bad guys are in power, riding on the heads of the people." The bad guys are cruel capitalism and imperialism, which treat hardworking people like beasts of burden. This is the source of our unhappiness and the reason why one in five hospitalized patients is mentally ill.

    I know that all of this will eventually pass, but it will not end suddenly like a passing shower. Only when countless people like George and Alice overthrow the imperialist "bad guys" riding on their heads can the current situation be changed. That day will definitely come. I know George is a brave tank driver, and when he understands the goal of the struggle, he will definitely be a brave fighter in the strike struggle. However, George and Alice, like some ordinary Americans, still cannot understand the political significance of real life. A whole set of tightly controlled newspapers, radios, televisions, and movies prevent them from understanding the truth of our times.

    But I understand George, I also understand Alice, and I have confidence in them. We talked all night. We talked about the whole world, especially the world of the one-third of humanity that does not belong to installment merchants. (Special Contribution to this Newspaper)

    纽约书简
    美国　威廉·史密斯
    一位远方的朋友来信对我说：“同我谈谈美国的生活情况吧！我愈阅读有关美国的书籍就愈感觉迷惑。当然，我不是从火星上来的人，但是美国的确使我大惑不解。请你写信来吧！”信上还谈了许多别的事情，不过，以上一段话是来信的要点。
    既然他是我的一位好朋友，我就设法满足他的要求。我们是在第二次世界大战时期结识的。照美国的说法，我们相处得顶瓜瓜。但是从什么地方讲起呢？从白人到达美洲以前居住在美洲的红种印第安人讲起吗？我往往想把印第安人以及白人给他们带来了“文明”以后他们的遭遇，作为美国故事的开篇。从1776年的革命谈起吗？那次革命使我们脱离了英王乔治的专制。可是考虑到美国官方今日对革命的看法，我认为这样的开始是不妥当的。究竟从什么地方谈起呢？从解放黑奴的内战、还是从使世界流血而使亿万富翁大发横财的两次世界大战？
    我是一个直率的人，于是直捷了当地回了他这样一封信：
    美国今日的生活大概会使一个从火星上来的人感到诧异。但是我认为地球上其他地方的居民可能与星际居民一样，对美国大惑不解，也是不足为奇的。我知道，对美国说来，这种情形并不光彩。我感到难过。这是什么原故？请听吧！
    美国有一亿八千万人口。我们是来自世界各地的人们的后裔。我爱我的国土和它的勤劳的人民。他们勤劳奋发。在我遍踏祖国各地的四十多年间，我看见了想像力和勇气。但是，我也知道我们并不是一个愉快的民族，最近一二十年的情况尤其如此。美国的主要发言人都说，我们是世界上最富足的人民，美国居民比其他国家的居民拥有更多的汽车、洗衣机、洗碗机、电动器具、浴室、冰箱、电视机、收音机。这是不错的。可是，尽管有这些东西……拿我的朋友乔治作一个例子吧，像乔治那样的人何止数百万！
    乔治在匹兹堡一家钢铁厂作工。在美国，人们常说钢铁是首屈一指的行业。乔治是第二次世界大战的退伍军人。他参加过打败希特勒的战争，是一名优秀的坦克手。我们相知甚深。乔治回国以后，同一个漂亮的姑娘艾丽丝结了婚，养了两个孩子。从1946年起直到现在，乔治一直努力工作。他和艾丽丝积蓄了一些钱，买了一所房屋。他们一次付了三千美元，其余的一万元分期向房产公司支付。我到乔治家里去过多次。这所房屋共有四个房间，此外还有浴室和一小块草坪。艾丽丝还有一个冰箱。不过，尽管她有这些电气用器，她仍旧一天到晚忙个不停。乔治夫妇勤俭持家，好容易才在匹兹堡郊外买了这所整洁的小房子。前几天，我接到乔治拍来的急电，就去探望他们。乔治是我的战友，我们共同经历过艰苦的战斗和患难。可是我从来没有看见过他是那样的忧虑。
    当我走进屋子的时候，乔治勉强装出笑容来表示欢迎。但是当我们在一个小酒店里坐下来聊天的时候，我就知道发生了什么事情了。这是现代美国的一个故事。
    乔治没有去上工。他已经有十个月没有上工。他说，“这个情形把我逼疯了。”
    五年以前，他们购买了这座房子。乔治苦笑着说，“购买”这个字用得不恰当。每月的分期付款使他们苦恼不堪。他们又赊购了一辆
  “福特”小汽车，第一次付款五百元，其余的二千四百元，也是按月分期付款的。他们还赊购了一架电视机，第一次付款七十五元，其余的二百五十元按月分期偿付。
    虽然如此，乔治工作踏实，十个月以前当他还没有失业的时候，他们勉强应付了各种开支。乔治说：“这时我已经发现我是一个属于各种公司的人。地产公司占有我一部分，福特汽车公司、威斯汀豪斯公司各占有我的另外部分。”乔治的每一分精力都用来应付每月的分期付款计划。分期付款成了乔治生活的主宰。他为了应付赊购品收款员而干着单调刻板的工作，疲于奔命，连看书的时间都没有，而乔治本来是一个欢喜读书的人。乔治很少出去看电影或进城去看戏，因为他买不起票，赊购品收款员、收税员像潮汐涨落一样准确无误地前来收账。他们只要有钱到手就彬彬有礼，笑容可掬。为了保证按时付款，乔治利用他的仅有的一点业余时间——每天傍晚——兼做别的工作，赚几块钱的额外收入。艾丽丝也在一家百货商店里干部分时间的工作。乔治和艾丽丝简直没有在一起的时候。白天，大家都上工，匆匆用过晚饭，接着就是晚上的工作。艾丽丝从百货商店归家以后，也十分疲乏。乔治说：“我的家庭生活也毁了！”
    不过，当乔治还没有失业的时候，他们还可以维持。但是，钢的产量开始下降了。目前的产量不到生产能力的50％。人们失业了。工作了十五年、“运气最好的”乔治也收到了被解雇的通知。当时，他还怀着希望说，不久就会恢复工作的。但是日子飞快地过去，乔治不得不到失业辅助金办事处去领取每星期四十五元的失业辅助金，这个数目不到他工作时期收入的一半。他开始拖欠分期付款的账款了。接着，六个月过去，失业辅助金领完了，再过不久，乔治为不幸的日子所准备的积蓄也用光了。
    “现在，我怎么办呢？”他焦灼地问道。眼睛向四周打量，仿佛要找到一个逃避现实的出路。我看着他那副痛苦的脸面，感到心痛。
    如果找不到钱来按月分期付款，乔治不久就要失去他的房屋，房产公司要把房屋拿回去。福特公司的汽车收账员也在警告他，电视机商店也给他难堪。怎么办呢？
    我向你讲了乔治的故事。乔治失业了。我并不想造成这样的印象：大多数的美国人都失了业。不过，在美国失业的人约有五百万名。他们大都是钢铁、汽车制造业的工人。所有的美国人都担心着有一天，也许就在明天，失业会降临他的身上，所有的美国人都感受赊购品收账员的威胁。
    对美国人民说来，最重要的是缺乏安全保障。我们不知道失了业以后怎么办。我们的失业辅助金只有六个月的期限。过了六个月以后呢？去领有类于施舍的“救济”实在使人感到羞愧。但是失业者也只好按期到市政府办事处去领取救济的食物——一些干酪和土豆，有时候还领不到。
    我们从最近的一次社会福利工作人员会议上，得知在医院里，每五个住院病人中，就有一个是精神病人，在我们这个“世界上最富裕的国家里，精神病人为数最多”。乔治说：“这个情形把我逼疯了！”像乔治这样的人何止数百万。最根本的原因是缺乏安全保障、无力偿付赊购的账款。事实上，我们并不属于我们自己。我们属于各种强大的公司和垄断集团。这些大公司和垄断集团是房屋、汽车、冰箱和几乎一切东西的主人。
    美国的这些所有者，不但占有美国人民的劳动力，他们也占有美国人民的灵魂。近二十五年以来，美国的文化、政治气候像从山坡上奔驰下来而刹车失灵的汽车一样，迅速恶化。当赊购品收款员还没有从乔治那里拿走电视机以前，乔治一家人所能观看到的电视节目，是一些极端庸俗低级的东西。每天晚上都有我们所谓的“武打”节目，西部骑马牧童枪杀印第安人；白天里，这种节目也有五、六次之多……匪盗枪杀警察、警察击毙匪盗……等等。这是我们的日常的文化，它也反映一种政治现实：美国政府急不及待地想使用原子弹。美国一再拒绝与社会主义国家就禁止核战争取得协议，美国每年要耗费四百五十亿美元来扩军备战。军火商人日益暴富、美国人民日益贫困。用于杀人武器的钱愈多，花在学校、医院、养老金、房屋等改善生活措施的经费就愈少。
    朋友，我怀着沉痛的心情，向你讲说了这些使我忧虑的事情。
    七十五年以前，爱默生曾经警告过美国人民说：“坏家伙掌握着权力，骑在人们的头上”，坏家伙就是残酷的资本主义、帝国主义，它们把勤劳的人民当牛马。这是我们的不快乐的来源，也是每五个住院病人中必有一个是精神失常的人的原因。
    我知道，这一切终将成为过去，但是它不会像一阵骤雨突然中止。只有无数的像乔治和艾丽丝这样的人推翻了骑在他们头上的帝国主义“坏家伙”，才能改变目前的情况。这个日子一定会到来的。我知道乔治是一个勇敢的坦克手，当他了解了斗争的目标，他在罢工斗争中肯定也是一名勇敢的斗士。不过，乔治和艾丽丝正像一些普通的美国人一样，他们还不能理解现实生活的政治意义。一整套控制周密的报刊、无线电、电视、电影，使他们无从了解我们时代的真相。
    但是，我了解乔治、我也了解艾丽丝，我对他们有信心。我们作了竟夕之谈。我们谈到了整个世界、尤其是那不属于赊销商人的三分之一人类的世界。　（本报特约稿）
