Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 7th. Shenyang's mechanical industry workers are resolutely implementing the principle of "the whole country as a single chessboard," vigorously manufacturing agricultural machinery while also focusing on producing equipment for mining, steel smelting, and transportation, as arranged by the state, to promote a substantial increase in steel production. According to statistics from municipal mechanical plants, the supply of mine cars, locomotives, pneumatic tools, blowers, and water pumps for the steel, coal, and transportation industries in July reached more than 15,800 units, an increase of 13% over June. The supply of mining equipment such as ball mills and crushers increased eighteenfold compared to June.

To promote an even greater steel output increase in the second half of this year, factories involved in manufacturing equipment for the four sectors of coal, iron, mining, and transportation have, over the past month, re-evaluated their production plans and contracts based on the principle of "the overall situation comes first, guarantee key projects," ensuring the production of equipment related to steel and coal transport as arranged by the state. After guaranteeing the production of key equipment in terms of manpower, equipment, and materials, the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant produced 157 tons more mining equipment in July than in June. In order to establish the concept of "the whole country as a single chessboard" among workers and ensure the completion of key products, the Party Committee of the Shenyang Metallurgical Machinery Repair and Manufacturing Plant held three meetings of Party members and cadres in July, repeatedly explaining the importance of ensuring the completion of key metallurgical equipment. This approach of adhering to the principle of "politics in command" played a significant role in accelerating the manufacturing of key products.

To ensure the timely, high-quality, and high-volume completion of key steel and coal transportation equipment production tasks, leading cadres of various factories have gone deep into the front lines of production to understand the situation in a timely manner and solve problems on the spot. The director and personnel of various departments of the Shenyang Fan Factory solved a total of 30 key problems by going deep into the production workshops in July. For example, after promptly discovering incomplete product components, they immediately re-arranged the production schedule and transferred some manpower from the fourth workshop to rush-produce 200 kinds of supporting parts, increasing the component completion rate from 15% to over 80%. The Party Committee Secretary and Director of the Shenyang Metallurgical Machinery Repair and Manufacturing Plant jointly went deep into the most difficult processing workshops and, together with workers and cadres, developed a parallel assembly line operation method. After its promotion, this method greatly accelerated the production progress of large and key components, creating conditions for the early completion of the coking equipment manufacturing tasks assigned by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry.

In the rush to manufacture key equipment for steel, iron, coal, and transportation, workers at various machinery factories in Shenyang have launched technical innovation and technical revolution movements. The Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant launched a "clever tailor" movement, using nesting methods to improve material utilization and using leftover materials of all sizes. In July alone, the entire plant saved more than 60 tons of steel. After vigorously promoting product design revolution, workers at the Shenyang Fan Factory not only reduced the amount of steel used in many products but also improved product performance.

    集中优势力量　突击重点产品
    沈阳市属机械厂上月供应的设备大大超过6月
    新华社沈阳7日电　沈阳市机械工业职工坚决贯彻全国一盘棋方针，在大力制造农业机械的同时，抓紧生产国家安排的矿山、钢铁冶炼和交通运输方面的设备，以促进钢铁生产大幅度增长。据市属机械厂的统计，7月份供应钢铁、煤炭和运输业的矿车、机车、风动工具、鼓风机和水泵等设备，共达一万五千八百多台，比6月份增长了13％，供应矿山用的球磨机、破碎机等设备比6月份增加了十八倍。
    为了促进钢产量在今年下半年取得更大丰收，全市有关制造煤、铁、矿、运四种设备的工厂，最近一个多月以来，根据全局第一、保证重点的原则，重新进行了计划排队和合同排队，保证国家安排的有关钢铁煤运方面的设备的生产。沈阳矿山机器厂从人力、设备和材料方面保证重点设备的生产以后，7月份比6月份增产矿山设备一百五十七吨。沈阳冶金机械修造厂为了在职工中树立起全国一盘棋的思想，确保重点产品的完成，工厂党委在7月份接连召开了三次党员干部大会，反复地说明保证冶金重点设备完成的重要意义。这种坚持政治挂帅的作法，对加速重点产品的制造起了很大作用。
    为了保证按时、按质、按量、按品种地完成钢铁煤运重点设备生产任务，各个工厂的领导干部都纷纷深入生产第一线，及时了解情况，就地解决问题，沈阳扇风机厂的厂长和各科室人员，7月份深入生产车间共解决了三十项关键问题。例如，他们及时发现了不成套的产品部件以后，就立即重新编排了生产进度计划，并且从四车间抽调出一部分力量，突击赶制出二百种配套零件，使部件成套率由15％提高到80％以上。沈阳冶金机械修造厂党委书记和厂长，共同深入到困难最大的加工车间，和工人、干部一起，研究出了平行流水作业的办法，推广以后，大大加快了大型关键部件的生产进度，为提前完成冶金部安排的炼焦设备制造任务创造了条件。
    在赶制钢、铁、煤、运重点设备中，沈阳市各机械工厂职工开展了技术革新和技术革命运动。沈阳机车车辆厂开展巧裁缝运动，利用套裁方法，提高了材料的利用率，并且把剩下的料头料边，以小拼大，量材使用。7月份全厂就节省了六十多吨钢铁材料。沈阳扇风机厂职工大搞产品设计革命后，不但使许多产品的钢铁用料减少了，而且提高了产品的性能。（附图片）
