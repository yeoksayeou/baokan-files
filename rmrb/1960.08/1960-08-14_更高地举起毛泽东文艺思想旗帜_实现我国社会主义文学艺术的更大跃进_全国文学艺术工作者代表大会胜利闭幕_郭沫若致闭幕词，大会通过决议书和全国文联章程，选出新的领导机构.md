Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The Third National Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers, lasting twenty-three days, concluded victoriously this afternoon in the Great Hall of the People. At the closing ceremony, all delegates expressed their determination to hold high the banner of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, resolutely follow the Party's literary and art line, and strive to achieve a greater leap forward in China's socialist literature and art.

The closing ceremony was presided over by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. The more than two thousand delegates attending the closing ceremony expressed their gratitude and joy for the teachings and encouragement given to literary and art workers by the Party and state leaders. During the conference, Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and other Party and state leaders received all the delegates, allowing them to personally experience the Party and government's close care and earnest expectations for the cause of literature and art and literary and art workers. The important reports on the domestic and international situation made by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Vice Premier Li Fuchun allowed the delegates to see more clearly the excellent situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, and the splendid picture of the thriving economic and cultural construction of our country, thereby receiving great encouragement and education. Comrade Lu Dingyi's congratulatory message to the Congress on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council was a fighting program for socialist literature and art, pointing out the clear path and future tasks for literary and art workers. In their speeches at the general sessions and group discussions, the delegates unanimously stated that they would take practical actions to complete the important tasks assigned to them by the Party and the people and make greater contributions to the Party and the people's cause of literature and art. At today's closing ceremony, all delegates, with even more excited hearts and firm confidence, passed a congratulatory telegram to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and a resolution of the Congress.

In the congratulatory telegram, all the delegates assured the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao that they would continue to resolutely implement the Party's literary and art line in the future, continue to go deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers, constantly transform their thinking, firmly establish a proletarian world outlook, and create outstanding works worthy of this great era. They will resolutely stand on the front lines of the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, and unite all progressive and revolutionary artists around the world to fight for the defense of world lasting peace and the progress of mankind.

The resolution of the Congress pointed out that the Congress unanimously agreed with Guo Moruo's opening remarks and Zhou Yang's report entitled "The Road of Socialist Literature and Art"; the Congress further clarified that implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend, and weeding through the old to bring forth the new under the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the socialist cause is the most correct, broadest, and most creative road for the development of socialist literature and art; the Congress believes that the primary task of China's literature and art is to improve the socialist and communist ideological awareness and moral character of the people throughout the country through various literary and artistic forms, thoroughly eliminate the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, and actively serve China's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Guo Moruo delivered the final closing remarks. He said: This Congress is a victory celebration for literary and art workers, and also a mobilization meeting to further strengthen unity and strive for greater victories. Through this Congress, it can be seen that China's literary and artistic ranks are firmly united under the literary and artistic guidelines and policies stipulated by the Party and Chairman Mao. In the future, literary and art workers across the country must unite even more closely around the Party and Chairman Mao, implement the spirit of the Congress into action, seek truth from facts, work diligently, and make China's socialist literature and art achieve even more brilliant accomplishments. In his closing remarks, Guo Moruo also emphasized the need to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen the unity with all progressive and revolutionary literary and art workers in all countries of the world, and strive to establish a broad united front against the imperialist forces headed by US imperialism.

The closing ceremony of the Congress was conducted in a very excited and emotional atmosphere. The closing ceremony ended at 5:30 PM.

During the Congress, more than three hundred and twenty delegates made speeches or written statements at the Congress of Literary and Art Workers or at the enlarged meetings of the council of various associations. The Congress also adopted the Constitution of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and elected two hundred and twenty-four members of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Workers, and sixteen chairmen and vice chairmen.

During the closing ceremony, more than two hundred Young Pioneers from Beijing art colleges and art groups came to the venue to congratulate the Congress. Amidst the lively drum music, they walked to the rostrum holding flowers, presented flowers to the presidium of the Congress, and recited congratulatory poems. They used flowers to express the hearts of the socialist and communist literary and art successors: May literary and art workers, under the light of Mao Zedong Thought, improve every day and climb the Mount Everest of revolutionary literature and art; May the garden of literature and art in the future bloom even more luxuriantly, more beautifully, and more fragrantly.
