Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: The Shahe People's Commune in Changping County, Beijing, was named the Shahe China-Vietnam Friendship People's Commune today. Fifteen hundred commune members and Vietnamese guests gathered to warmly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the naming ceremony of the Shahe China-Vietnam Friendship People's Commune.

Tran Tu Binh, Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, and other diplomatic officials, Tran Huy Lieu, head of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation, and all members of the delegation, the entire members of the Vietnamese Cheo Opera Troupe of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam led by Vu Thu, and the entire members of the Vietnamese Institute of Literature Delegation led by Hoai Thanh were invited to attend the meeting. When the distinguished guests arrived at the commune, commune members gathered on both sides of the road outside the village, waving bouquets, beating gongs and drums, playing folk music, and setting off firecrackers to warmly welcome them.

Zhao Pengfei, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, Xia Yan, Director of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association and Vice Minister of Culture, Yang Xiandong, Vice Minister of Agriculture, Chen Shuliang, Director of the Second Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lu Ming, Deputy Director of the First Department of the Foreign Cultural Commission, Zhang Junshi, Second Secretary of the Changping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Head of Changping County, and others attended the celebration meeting.

Zhao Pengfei, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, spoke at the meeting. He extended a warm welcome and heartfelt congratulations to the representatives of the heroic Vietnamese people. He said that under the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the brave and hardworking Vietnamese people have combated the aggression and subversion activities of US imperialism in Indochina, strongly supported the national democratic movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and made great contributions to the cause of world peace. At the same time, socialist construction and socialist transformation are being carried out victoriously in North Vietnam, and the Chinese people warmly hail the brilliant achievements made by the Vietnamese people.

Zhao Pengfei said that the people of China and Vietnam have a deep traditional friendship. After the liberation of our two peoples, this friendship is even more firmly established on the new foundation of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. It is evergreen and cannot be destroyed by any force. The people of our two countries will always unite in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, support each other, help each other, and jointly strive for the beautiful future of mankind—communism.

Zhao Pengfei said that the naming of the Shahe People's Commune as the Shahe China-Vietnam Friendship People's Commune is an honor and an encouragement to all commune members. In the future, all commune members should further develop their revolutionary spirit under the guidance of the three red banners of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and thank the Vietnamese people for their friendship with more outstanding achievements.

Ambassador Tran Tu Binh spoke at the meeting. He first conveyed the greetings of President Ho Chi Minh, the most respected leader of the Vietnamese people, to all commune members. Tran Tu Binh said that the Vietnamese people have always been concerned about and very happy to see the great achievements of the Chinese people in all aspects. The Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people has greatly encouraged the revolutionary struggle and socialist construction of the Vietnamese people. Tran Tu Binh said that the naming of the Shahe China-Vietnam Friendship People's Commune is a major event that will further strengthen the friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China and exchange experiences in building socialism.

Tran Huy Lieu, head of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation, spoke at the meeting. He said that under the banner of proletarian internationalism, the people of the two countries are fighting side by side in socialist construction and in the struggle against US imperialism. Tran Huy Lieu said that the Vietnamese people are victoriously carrying out socialist construction and socialist transformation in the North of the country, while the South of Vietnam, under the rule of the US-Ngo clique, has become a military base of US imperialism, and the people of South Vietnam are living in dire straits. Now, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Vietnamese people are fighting for the complete liberation of their territory and the crushing of all conspiracies of US imperialism and its running dogs, and the cause of peaceful reunification of Vietnam will surely be successful.

Zhao Haiquan, director of the Shahe China-Vietnam Friendship People's Commune, extended festive congratulations to the distinguished guests on behalf of all commune members and, through the distinguished guests, to the fraternal Vietnamese people. He stated that all commune members must cherish the glorious title of the China-Vietnam Friendship People's Commune and make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland and to strengthening the friendship between the people of China and Vietnam.

At the meeting, the Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation presented the commune with a photo of Chairman Mao and President Ho Chi Minh shaking hands cordially and a banner with the inscription "Long Live the Friendship Between the People of Vietnam and China," as well as gifts such as picture albums, handicrafts, bicycles, and records.

After the meeting, Chinese and Vietnamese music, dance, and other cultural programs were performed, and artists from the Cheo Opera Troupe of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also gave wonderful performances. (Attached picture)

    越南贵宾参加庆祝大会受到社员热烈欢迎
    新华社29日讯　北京市昌平县沙河人民公社今天命名为沙河中越友好人民公社。一千五百名社员和越南贵宾在一起，热烈地举行了庆祝越南民主共和国成立十五周年和庆祝沙河中越友好人民公社命名大会。
    越南民主共和国驻中国大使陈子平和其他外交官员，越中友协代表团团长陈辉燎和全体团员，由武秋率领的越南民主共和国嘲剧艺术团全体团员和由怀青率领的越南文学院代表团全体团员应邀参加了大会。当贵宾们到达公社时，聚集在村外马路两边的社员挥舞着花束，敲锣打鼓，吹奏着民间音乐，燃放鞭炮，热情欢迎。
    北京市副市长赵鹏飞，中越友好协会理事、文化部副部长夏衍，农业部副部长杨显东，外交部第二亚洲司司长陈叔亮，对外文委第一司副司长鲁明，中共北京市昌平县委第二书记、昌平县县长张俊士等都参加了庆祝大会。
    北京市副市长赵鹏飞在会上讲话。他向英雄的越南人民的代表表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的祝贺。他说，英勇勤劳的越南人民，在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的英明领导下，打击了美帝国主义在印度支那的侵略、颠覆活动，有力地支持了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的民族民主运动，对世界和平事业作出了巨大的贡献。与此同时，在越南北方胜利地进行着社会主义建设和社会主义改造，中国人民热烈欢呼越南人民所取得的这些辉煌成就。
    赵鹏飞说，中越两国人民有着深厚的传统友谊。在我们两国人民获得解放以后，这种友谊更加牢固地建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的新的基础之上，它是万古长青、任何力量也破坏不了的。我们两国人民将永远团结在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭里，互相支持，互相帮助，为人类美好的未来——共产主义而共同奋斗。
    赵鹏飞说，沙河人民公社命名为沙河中越友好人民公社，这是全体社员一种荣誉，也是一种鼓舞，今后全体社员应该在党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的指引下，进一步发挥革命干劲，以更加出色的成绩答谢越南人民的友谊。
    陈子平大使在会上讲话。他首先转达了越南人民最敬爱的领袖胡志明主席对全体社员的问候。陈子平说，越南人民一向关心并非常高兴地看到中国人民在各方面的伟大成就。中国人民的大跃进，对越南人民的革命斗争事业和社会主义建设事业起着很大的鼓舞作用。陈子平说，沙河中越友好人民公社的命名是一件大事，它将进一步加强越中两国人民之间的友谊联系和交流建设社会主义的经验。
    越中友协代表团团长陈辉燎在会上讲话。他说，在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下，两国人民正在社会主义的建设中和反对美帝国主义的斗争中并肩战斗。陈辉燎说，越南人民正在祖国的北方胜利地进行着社会主义建设和社会主义改造，而越南南方在美吴集团的统治下，变成了美帝国主义的军事基地，越南南方的人民正生活在水深火热之中。现在，越南人民在越南劳动党的领导下，正为完全解放自己的领土和粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的一切阴谋而斗争，越南的和平统一事业一定会获得成功。
    沙河中越友好人民公社主任赵海泉在大会上代表全体社员向贵宾并通过贵宾向兄弟的越南人民致节日的祝贺。他表示，全体社员一定要珍视中越友好人民公社这个光荣的称号，为祖国的社会主义建设和加强中越两国人民的友谊作出更大贡献。
    会上，越中友协代表团将一幅毛主席和胡主席亲切握手的照片和一面写着“越中人民友谊万岁”的锦旗赠送给公社，并且还赠送了画册、手工艺品、自行车、唱片等礼物。
