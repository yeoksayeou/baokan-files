Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Anhui Province is meticulously managing oil crops by focusing on fertilization and weeding, striving for high yields.
    Party committees at all levels in Anhui Province are closely monitoring the planting and management of oil crops. This year's plantings of peanuts, soybeans, sesame, as well as interplanted oil crops in the rows of tall-stalked and vining crops, are generally growing well due to careful and timely management. Early-sown sesame and peanuts have already flowered, and soybeans have also covered the ground.
    In response to the excellent situation of oil crop growth, local Party committees have widely carried out propaganda and education work, emphasizing the need to implement the policy of "taking grain as the key link and developing a diversified economy." It is crucial to focus on both grain production and oil crop production, and to criticize the one-sided thinking of a few people who consider "managing grain crops as important, and oil crops as trivial." After conducting propaganda and education work in Wuwei County, Wuhu Prefecture, each commune in the county assigned dedicated personnel at each level, organized professional teams, and universally implemented a responsibility system of contracting area, quality, and work points. They are vigorously managing oil crop fields. To date, the county's more than 9,000 mu of peanuts have been loosened and kept moist before the wheat harvest, and have been fertilized twice after the wheat harvest. Trailing peanuts have been pressed, and standing peanuts have been topped. Weeding, thinning, and setting seedlings have also been carried out for soybeans and sesame. In management, in order to achieve the goal of "planting must yield, and yielding must be high-yielding," localities have also tailored their measures to local conditions and crop varieties to strengthen management. For example, soybeans need sufficient moisture when flowering, so the soil is kept appropriately moist; peanuts need more fertilizer, so more fertilizer is applied to ensure they are well-fed and watered. In Liu'an County, more than 20,000 people are mobilized every day to process and manage oil crops. The county's 230,000 mu of oil crops have been weeded one to two times, and fine fertilizer has been universally applied in conjunction with weeding, based on the growth situation. According to the growth of sesame, the People's Communes of Chu County, Bengbu Prefecture, have adopted the method of managing early-sown crops first, and weeding before thinning, so that weeds are completely removed and missing seedlings are filled in, ensuring that every mu of sesame has full and thriving seedlings.

    This newspaper reports: The Yuxi County People's Communes in Yunnan Province, a famous "Yunyan" (Yunnan Tobacco) production area, are seizing the opportunity after rain and clear weather. In light of the growth characteristics of this year's flue-cured tobacco, they are organizing labor to advance the field processing of flue-cured tobacco, vigorously watering with "manure water," vigorously weeding, vigorously pressing (fertilizer), vigorously hilling (soil), and vigorously dredging (ditches) to promote the rapid development of tobacco plants. At present, the 96,200 mu of flue-cured tobacco planted in Yuxi County have been watered with two applications of manure, weeded once, ditched, and hilled with soil.

    勤锄草　多追肥　适时浇水
    安徽精心管理油料作物
    云南玉溪县根据云烟生长特点加强管理
    新华社讯　安徽省各地人民公社以追肥、锄草为中心，全面加强对油料作物的田间管理，力争油料作物高产多收。
    安徽省各级党委对油料作物的种植和管理工作抓得很紧。今年种植的花生、大豆、芝麻以及利用高秆、蔓生作物的行间，套种、间种的油料作物，由于管得细，管得及时，目前都普遍生长良好。早播的芝麻、花生已经开花，大豆也合垅盖地。
    各地党委针对当前油料作物生长的一派大好形势，广泛开展了宣传教育工作，强调必须贯彻“以粮为纲，发展多种经济”的方针，既要抓好粮食生产，又要抓好油料生产，批判了少数人的“管理粮食作物是大事，油料作物是小事”的片面思想。芜湖专区无为县进行宣传教育工作以后，全县各公社层层确定专人负责，组织专业队，普遍推行了包面积、包质量、包工分的责任制，大抓油料作物田间管理。到现在止，全县九千多亩花生，除麦收前进行松土保墒外，麦收后又追肥两遍，对拖秧花生进行了压秧，站秧花生进行压心，对大豆、芝麻也都进行了锄草和间苗、定苗。各地在管理中，为使油料作物达到“种必收，收必高产”的要求，还因地制宜，分别作物品种，精心加强管理。如大豆开花时，需要足够的水分，就使土壤保持适当的湿度；花生需要肥料多，就多施肥，保证吃饱喝足。六安县每天出动二万多人，加工管理油料作物，全县二十三万亩油料作物，已分别锄草一到二遍，并针对生长情况，结合锄草普遍追细肥。蚌埠专区滁县各人民公社根据芝麻生长情况，采取先播先管、先锄草后间苗等办法，边锄草，边间苗，做到了杂草除尽，缺苗补齐，确保亩亩芝麻苗全苗旺。
    本报讯　著名“云烟”产区——云南省玉溪县各人民公社针对今年烤烟生长的特点，抓住雨后天晴时机，组织劳力，提前进行烤烟田间加工，突击大浇“粪水”、大锄（草）、大压（肥）、大壅（土）、大提（沟），促进烟株迅速发棵长叶。目前，玉溪县种植的九万六千二百亩烤烟，已浇过二道粪水，锄完一道草，提过沟，壅好土。
