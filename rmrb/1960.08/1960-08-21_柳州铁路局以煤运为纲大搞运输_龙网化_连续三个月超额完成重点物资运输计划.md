The Liuzhou Railway Bureau in Guangxi is taking coal transportation as the key, vigorously promoting "dragon network" transportation, strengthening cooperation between railway and mines, and actively carrying out technical reforms in loading and unloading, making the "high transportation guarantees high production" emulation campaign a roaring success. Since May, the bureau has overfulfilled the coal transportation plan for three consecutive months, and in the first ten days of August, it achieved another victory with a daily surplus of 20%.

At the beginning of July, the Liuzhou Railway Bureau Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized the experience of grasping coal transportation and driving the transportation of other key materials in the first half of the year. Based on the leaping situation of the development of industrial and agricultural production in the second half of the year, the bureau's freight volume will increase greatly compared with the first half of the year, and the bureau required that the transportation work in the second half of the year must continue to take coal transportation as the key to ensure the transportation of major materials such as steel, grain, and timber. It also stipulated that the transportation of coal and other key materials should be fully incorporated into the national plan, and the tasks should be completed on a monthly, ten-day, and daily basis. According to this decision, the Railway Bureau Transportation Command, all offices, and major stations first further promoted the "dragon network" transportation in the transportation organization. When compiling the comprehensive transportation operation plan every month, the Railway Bureau incorporated the coal and other major materials of the main factories, mines, and ports under its jurisdiction into the "one-dragon" plan, with the "coal dragon" as the head of the "dragon" group, and using the "coal dragon" to protect the "dragon" group, and then adopting methods such as fixed points (fixed departure time), fixed lines (fixed running time), fixed train groups, fixed locomotives, and fixed loading and unloading manpower to ensure uninterrupted transportation of coal and other major materials.

The Railway Bureau also signed "one-dragon" transportation agreements with major coal mines, steel plants, iron mines, manganese plants, lumber yards, and ports; key coal mines such as Dongluo, Heshan, and Tunli have established joint transportation command posts with the railway, linking the transportation inside the mine with the external transportation of the station, so that the coal does not touch the ground and there is no blockage at both ends. After Dongluo Coal Mine implemented road-mine cooperation, the external transportation volume immediately increased by 28%, and the phenomenon of external transportation exceeding output appeared, and the vehicle dwell time was shortened by half.

The Liuzhou Railway Bureau, in view of the weak link of "vehicles running in the middle and nesting at both ends," aimed the technical reform at the loading and unloading links. In the past few months, twenty-nine high platforms and thirty-seven low cargo positions, with a total length of six thousand nine hundred and twenty-eight meters, have been established in key stations. The transportation workers of the bureau have also made more than one thousand and one hundred pieces of sliding tools. Major stations have skids, slides, sliding plates, chutes, various indigenous methods of erecting poles and cranes, conveyors, and other machinery to further improve transportation efficiency.

### 柳州铁路局以煤运为纲大搞运输“龙网化”连续三个月超额完成重点物资运输计划

    柳州铁路局以煤运为纲大搞运输“龙网化”连续三个月超额完成重点物资运输计划
    本报讯　广西柳州铁路局以煤运为纲，大搞运输“龙网化”，加强路矿协作，积极进行装卸技术改革，使“高运保高产”的竞赛运动搞得轰轰烈烈踏踏实实。全局5月份以来，连续三个月超额完成运煤计划，8月上旬又以每天超额20％的成绩告捷。
    7月初，中共柳州铁路局委员会总结了上半年抓煤炭、带动其他重点物资运输的工作经验，根据下半年工农业生产的发展，全局货运量将比上半年大大增长的跃进形势，要求全局下半年运输工作必须继续以煤运为纲，确保钢铁、粮食、木材等主要物资的运输。并规定把煤炭等重点物资运输完全纳入国家计划，按月、按旬、按日完成任务。根据这一决定，铁路局运输指挥部、各办事处和重要车站首先在运输组织上，进一步大搞运输“龙网化”。铁路局每月在编制运输综合作业方案时，都把局管辖的主要厂、矿、港口的煤炭等主要物资纳入“一条龙”计划，以“煤龙”为群“龙”之首，以“煤龙”保群“龙”，然后采取定点（定开车时间）、定线（定运行时刻）、定车组、定机车、定装卸人力等方法，保证煤炭等主要物资不间断的运输。
    铁路局与主要煤矿，钢铁厂、铁矿、锰厂、贮木场、港口等单位还签定了“一条龙”运输协议；岽罗、合山、屯里等重点煤矿都和铁路建立了运输联合指挥部，把矿厂内的运输与车站的外运联成一起，作到煤不落地、两头不堵。岽罗煤矿实行路矿协作后，外运量立即上升了28％，并出现了外运超过产量的现象，车辆停留时间缩短了一半。
    柳州铁路局针对“车辆跑在中间，窝在两头”的薄弱环节，把技术改革矛头指向装卸关。几个月来，在重点车站建立了高站台二十九座，低货位三十七座，共长六千九百二十八米。全局运输职工还制成了滑溜化工具达一千一百多件，各主要站都有了滑架、滑道、滑板、滑槽、各种土法扒杆和吊车、输送机等机具，进一步提高了运输效率。
