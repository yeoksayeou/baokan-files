On Consolidating, Promoting, and Improving Work in the Great Technical Revolution Movement
Secretary of the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Feng Huanwu

    The technical innovation and technical revolution movement on the industrial front in Chengdu is rapidly changing the face of production technology in the city and promoting the sustained leap forward in industrial production. Due to the multiple increase in labor productivity, the city has saved labor equivalent to 16% of the total number of existing employees. Not only has it achieved "increased production without increasing manpower," but it has also transferred a large number of employees from old factories to support newly built and expanded enterprises and to support agricultural technology transformation. Workers say it well: "Machines are constantly changing, enthusiasm is constantly increasing, labor is constantly decreasing, and production is constantly increasing." This is truly a miracle. At the same time, technical innovation and technical revolution have also promoted the development of diversified operations and comprehensive utilization of enterprises, greatly increasing production and saving raw materials, and further improving working conditions and ensuring safe production. In the mass movement of the technical revolution, the communist cooperative relationship has greatly developed, people's mental outlook has rapidly changed, superstitious and conservative ideas have been continuously eliminated, people's understanding of the laws of production development has been continuously improved, and the communist style has been further promoted. The situation in Chengdu also shows that the technical revolution movement, which has developed on the basis of economic, political, ideological, and cultural revolution and two consecutive years of great leaps forward, is an important way for us to implement the Party's general line and realize continued great leaps forward, and also an important way to develop social productive forces at high speed and accelerate our country's socialist construction.
    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we have adopted the principle of boldly mobilizing the masses and everything through experimentation, fully mobilizing the broad masses of employees to boldly innovate, vigorously attack key and weak links in production, innovate machinery and operating techniques, try new technologies, new processes, and trial-produce new products, and constantly push the movement to new stages of development. At the same time, we have also focused on consolidating, promoting, and improving work, so that a large number of new machines, new technologies, and new processes have been widely promoted and used, and have played a huge role in production. Experience has shown that focusing on consolidating, promoting, and improving work is grasping a central link in the combination of the technical revolution and current production. By grasping it, we can make the flowers of the technical revolution quickly bear the fruit of production leap forward and greatly promote the leap forward development of the production movement and the technical revolution movement.
    To do a good job in consolidating, promoting, and improving the technical revolution, it is necessary to establish a correct Marxist-Leninist attitude towards new things. In the technical revolution movement, the masses' large number of innovations and creations are new things, and they all need active support and help in order to quickly improve and grow healthily. However, a small number of cadres lack enthusiasm for new things and do not pay enough attention to consolidating, promoting, and improving new machines, new technologies, and new processes; some workers feel unaccustomed to learning and promoting new technologies, new processes, and new machines, and therefore are unwilling to actively learn and promote their use. In the process of promoting new technologies, new processes, and new machines, many factories and enterprises, in addition to adopting various methods such as comparing new and old technologies to vigorously publicize the superiority of these new things, also organized employees to study and discuss how to correctly treat new things. After the study, the employees reflected that they should not stop a child from learning to walk just because he might fall, nor should they fail to actively support the growth of new things just because they have shortcomings. Because the broad masses of cadres and people have established a correct attitude towards new things, the work of consolidating, promoting, and improving has a broad mass character, and the results are even more remarkable. After organizing employees to study how to correctly treat new things, the Chengdu Pharmaceutical Factory greatly promoted the work of consolidating, promoting, and improving, and many new processes and new machines were normally used in production, showing a vivid scene of "flowers blooming all over the garden and fruits hanging from all the trees," which greatly improved the degree of semi-mechanization and mechanization of production. In the first half of this year, the labor productivity of this factory increased by 2.2 times compared with the same period last year. These facts show that correctly treating new things is a key to doing a good job in consolidating, promoting, and improving work and deepening the development of the technical revolution movement.
    Technical innovation and technical revolution is a vigorous mass movement. Whether it is carrying out large-scale innovation and creation, or focusing on consolidation, promotion, and improvement, it is necessary to always implement the mass line. Large-scale innovation and creation requires relying on the masses and carrying out mass movements; the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of the achievements of the technical revolution must also rely on the masses and carry out mass movements. In fact, promoting a new technology not only requires the production of many new machines, but also requires people to learn and master new operating methods. Only by fully mobilizing the masses can we produce the needed new machines in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Similarly, only by fully mobilizing the masses, making them understand the superiority of new technologies and the significance of promoting new technologies, and mastering the scientific principles and operating methods of new technologies, will the masses actively and actively learn and use new technologies, and the work of consolidating, promoting, and improving will have a broad mass foundation and can quickly achieve results. Chengdu Railway Station manufactured 299 various loading and unloading innovation machines in the technical revolution movement, but the utilization rate was low, only 40% in May. In June, they carried out a mass summary, appraisal, processing, and improvement work, and the utilization rate quickly increased to over 80%. It can be seen that summary, promotion, consolidation, and improvement are interconnected. Only by fully mobilizing the masses, through the practice of the masses, and giving full play to the wisdom of the masses, can we make correct summaries and appraisals of a large number of new machines and new technologies, quickly form complete sets, overcome certain technical deficiencies, and further consolidate and improve them. In the process of focusing on consolidation, promotion, and improvement, many units fully mobilized the masses, everyone started working, and everyone used their brains to conduct mass summaries and appraisals of the innovation achievements, selected and finalized types, and formed complete sets. At the same time, they also organized various in-factory and out-of-factory "three-way combination" technical assault teams and technical research groups to concentrate the forces of leading cadres, workers and technicians, factories and enterprises, scientific research institutions and universities, designers, manufacturers and users, etc., to study and solve the problems in the promotion and use of new technologies, new processes and new machines. In this way, some innovation projects were quickly improved from imperfect, incomplete sets were quickly matched, and the utilization rate of innovation projects was rapidly increased, and many new technologies and new experiences also emerged.
    The consolidation, promotion, and improvement of the achievements of the technical innovation and technical revolution require corresponding improvements in enterprise management. With the promotion of a large number of new technologies and new processes, work efficiency has increased exponentially, and a series of new problems have also emerged in management work; these problems must be solved in a timely manner in order to further promote the consolidation and improvement of the technical revolution movement. Plan management and quota management must be adapted to the improved labor productivity, production organization and labor organization must be adapted to the innovated production equipment and production processes, and process regulations and operating regulations must be adapted to the improved process processes and operating methods, etc. In this way, the superstructure and production relations can be adapted to the new development of productive forces. After promoting a batch of new technologies and new machines, the Chengdu Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant promptly revised the working hour quotas (average reduction of about 50%) and raw material consumption quotas after mass discussion, and at the same time launched a competition among the masses to break through the new quotas. As a result, more than 97% of the workers quickly realized and exceeded the new quotas, and many people reached "one is equal to two," "one is equal to three," and "one is equal to five," which greatly improved the level of production.
    The fundamental way to improve enterprise management is to implement the system of cadres participating in labor and workers participating in management. Only in this way can we overcome bureaucracy and ensure that new problems in enterprise management can be discovered and resolved in a timely manner. Since the beginning of this year, factories and enterprises in Chengdu have insisted on implementing and further developing the system of cadres participating in labor and workers participating in management. Many factories and enterprises, such as the Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutter Factory and the Chengdu Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, have implemented a system in which cadres participate in labor for half a day every day. Leading cadres also personally went to the front line of production, generally went deep into workshops and groups, ate, lived, worked, and consulted with the masses, experimented, improved, and jointly studied and solved major problems in the technical revolution movement. At the same time, the broad masses of employees also participated more widely in enterprise management, especially the management of production groups, so that professional management was combined with mass management, and enterprise management had a broader mass foundation. Further decentralization of power has been implemented, so that each production group has more power to handle production plans, technology, labor, and finance, etc. This has further given full play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees to carry out large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution, making the technical innovation and technical revolution even more enthusiastic.
    Production development is endless, and the technical revolution is also endless. We must never be complacent, and must, with the spirit of continuous revolution, focus on consolidating, promoting, and improving the work in the technical revolution movement, so that this movement will continue to develop along a correct, scientific, and national path.

    大抓技术革命运动中的巩固、推广和提高工作
    中共成都市委书记处书记　冯焕武
    成都市工业战线的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在迅速地改变着全市生产技术的面貌，推动着工业生产的持续跃进。由于劳动生产率的成倍增长，全市节约的劳动力相当于现有职工总数的16％。不仅做到了“增产不增人”，而且还从老厂中调出大批职工支援新建、扩建企业和支援农业技术改造。工人同志说得好：“机具不断在变，干劲不断在添，劳力不断在减，生产不断在翻”。这真正是奇迹。同时，技术革新和技术革命还推动了企业的多种经营和综合利用的发展，大大增产和节约了原材料，并进一步改善了劳动条件，保障了安全生产。在技术革命的群众运动中，共产主义协作关系大为发展，人们的精神面貌迅速改观，迷信守旧思想不断地被破除，人们对于生产发展规律的认识不断地提高，共产主义风格也更加发扬光大起来。成都市的情况同样说明，在经济、政治、思想、文化革命和两年连续大跃进的基础上发展起来的技术革命运动，是我们贯彻党的总路线，实现继续大跃进的一个重要途径，也是高速度地发展社会生产力，加速我国社会主义建设的一个重要途径。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，我们采取了放手发动群众，一切经过试验的原则，充分发动广大职工群众大胆革新，猛攻生产关键和薄弱环节，革新机具和操作技术，试用新技术、新工艺和试制新产品，不断地把运动推向新的发展阶段。同时，又大抓巩固、推广和提高的工作，使大批的新机具、新技术和新工艺得到了广泛的推广使用，在生产上发挥了巨大的效果。经验证明，大抓巩固、推广和提高工作，就是抓住了技术革命与当前生产相结合的一个中心环节。抓住了它，就能使技术革命之花，迅速结出生产跃进之果，大大推动生产运动和技术革命运动的飞跃发展。
    搞好技术革命的巩固、推广和提高工作，要求树立对待新事物的马克思列宁主义的正确态度。在技术革命运动中，群众的大量革新和创造是新生的事物，都需要积极地支持和帮助，才能够迅速地完善和健康地成长。可是，有少数干部对待新生事物缺乏热情，对巩固、推广、提高新机具、新技术和新工艺的工作不够重视；也有少数工人学习和推广新技术、新工艺和新机具感到不习惯，因而不愿意积极学习和推广使用。许多工厂企业在推广新技术、新工艺和新机具的过程中，除了采取新旧技术对比等各种方法，大力宣传这些新事物的优越性外，还组织职工学习和讨论了如何正确对待新生事物的问题。经过学习后，职工群众反映，不能因为小孩子走路会摔跤就不让他学走路，也不能因为新事物有缺点就不积极支持它的成长。由于广大干部和群众树立了正确对待新事物的态度，就使巩固、推广和提高工作具有了广泛的群众性，收效更加显著。成都制药厂在组织职工学习了如何正确对待新生事物的问题以后，就大大推动了巩固、推广和提高工作，许多新工艺、新机具在生产上正常使用，出现了“满园鲜花满树果”的生动气象，使生产的半机械化、机械化程度大大提高。今年上半年，这个厂的劳动生产率比去年同期提高了二点二倍。这些事实说明，正确对待新生事物，是搞好巩固、推广和提高工作，深入发展技术革命运动的一个关键。
    技术革新和技术革命是一个生气勃勃的群众运动。无论是大搞革新和创造，还是大抓巩固、推广和提高，都必须始终贯彻群众路线。大搞革新创造，需要依靠群众，大搞群众运动；进行技术革命成果的巩固、推广和提高工作，也同样必须依靠群众，大搞群众运动。事实上，推广一项新的技术，不仅需要制作许多新的机具，而且需要人们学会掌握新的操作方法。只有充分发动群众，才能多、快、好、省地制作出满足需要的新机具。同样也只有充分发动了群众，使群众了解新技术的优越性和推广新技术的意义，掌握新技术的科学原理和操作方法，群众才会主动、积极地学习和使用新技术，而巩固、推广和提高工作才会有广泛的群众基础，才能够迅速收到成效。成都火车站，在技术革命运动中制造出各种装卸革新机具二百九十九件，但是使用率较低，5月份使用率仅达40％。6月份，他们开展了群众性的总结、鉴定、加工和改进工作，使用率很快就提高到80％以上。可见，总结、推广、巩固和提高是互相联系的。只有充分发动群众，通过群众的实践，发挥群众的智慧，才能对大量的新机具、新技术作出正确的总结和鉴定，迅速配套成龙，克服技术上的某些欠缺，进一步加以巩固和提高。在大抓巩固、推广和提高的过程中，许多单位充分发动群众，人人动手，个个动脑，对革新成果进行了群众性的总结和鉴定，选型定型，配套成龙。同时，还组织各种厂内、厂外“三结合”的技术突击队和技术研究组，将领导干部、工人和技术人员，工厂企业、科学研究机关和大专学校，设计者、制造者和使用者等各方面的力量集中起来，研究解决新技术、新工艺和新机具在推广和使用中的问题。这样，就使某些革新项目由不完善的迅速完善起来，不配套的迅速配起套来，使革新项目的使用率迅速提高，而且还出现了许多新技术和新经验。
    技术革新和技术革命成果的巩固、推广和提高，要求相应地改进企业管理工作。随着大量新技术、新工艺的推广，工效成倍提高，管理工作上也出现了一系列的新的问题；必须及时解决这些问题，才能够进一步推动技术革命运动的巩固和提高。计划管理和定额管理必须同提高了的劳动生产率相适应，生产组织、劳动组织必须同革新了的生产设备和生产过程相适应，工艺规程、操作规程必须同改进了的工艺过程和操作方法相适应，等等。这样，才能使上层建筑、生产关系，适应生产力的新的发展。成都机车车辆厂在推广了一批新技术和新机具以后，及时经过群众讨论修改了工时定额（平均降低50％左右）和原材料消耗定额，并同时发动群众展开了突破新定额的竞赛。结果，97％以上的工人都迅速实现和超过了新的定额，许多人达到了“一顶二”、“一顶三”和“一顶五”，使生产水平大为提高。
    改进企业管理工作的根本途径，是实行干部参加劳动、工人参加管理。这样才能克服官僚主义，使企业管理工作中出现的新问题，能够及时发现，及时得到解决。今年以来，成都市工厂企业坚持执行并进一步发展了干部参加劳动、工人参加管理的制度。成都量具刃具厂、成都机车车辆厂等不少工厂企业，实行了干部每天以半天时间参加劳动的制度。领导干部也亲临生产第一线，普遍深入车间、小组与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，一起试验，一起改进，共同研究和解决技术革命运动中的重大问题。同时，职工群众也更广泛地参加了企业管理工作，特别是生产小组的管理工作，使专业管理同群众管理相结合，使企业管理工作有了更广泛的群众基础。进一步实行了权力下放，使各生产小组有更多的权力来处理本组的生产计划、技术、劳动和财务等方面的问题。这样，就更充分地发挥了职工群众大搞技术革新和技术革命的积极性，使技术革新和技术革命开展得更加热火朝天。
    生产发展是无穷无尽的，技术革命也是无穷无尽的。我们决不能自满，必须以不断革命的精神大抓技术革命运动中的巩固、推广和提高的工作，使这一运动沿着正确的、科学的、全民的轨道不断地向前发展。
