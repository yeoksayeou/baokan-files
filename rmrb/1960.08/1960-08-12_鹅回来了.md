For two days, the flood had surrounded Pingyang Village. Uncle Junshui tossed and turned on the loft, unable to sleep. When he closed his eyes, he seemed to see the flock of geese he raised for the commune, and then he seemed to see the little goslings hatching from their shells, filling his heart with joy. Suddenly, he heard several goose calls. Like a loving mother hearing her baby cry, he jumped up and listened intently. From the howling wind and rain, he heard several more goose calls. Junshui quickly struck a match and lit the small boat lamp. Just as he was about to go downstairs, Junshui's wife woke up and said, "Why aren't you sleeping in the middle of the night? What are you doing!" Junshui said, "Don't nag!" But his wife said, "The secretary said you haven't slept for two days and two nights and told you to come back to rest, but your heart is at the goose farm even when you're at home..." Junshui went downstairs as if he hadn't heard her. The water on the ground was already over his knees. He quickly took down two door panels, tied them together with a rope, hurriedly grabbed a bamboo pole, picked up the small boat lamp, pushed the door panels, and went out.

The night was pitch black, the wind and rain were fierce, and the flood was raging. Junshui's clothes were soaked through long ago. The door panels were constantly being blown this way and that by the wind and rain. A gust of wind blew out the small boat lamp, and layers of waves almost overturned the door panels. Fortunately, he was a skilled swimmer and steadied the door panels with the pole. Just as he was about to continue forward, how could he tell which way to go in this darkness where he couldn't see his own hand in front of his face? Just as Junshui was getting anxious, he suddenly heard several goose calls from the bamboo forest on the east side. Junshui was overjoyed and headed straight for the bamboo forest, guided by the flashes of lightning. Ah! A flock of geese appeared under the bamboo forest. As if seeing a treasure, he hurriedly called out, "Geese, geese, geese, come here!" However, a gust of wind and rain buffeted the geese, making them sway from side to side. How to drive the geese back? He quickly steadied the door panels with the bamboo pole and gently slipped into the water. The water reached his neck. He carefully swam towards the flock of geese and grabbed two of them with both hands. He could only hear the sound of the wind and the geese calling; the rest of the geese had scattered in fright. He hurriedly dragged the two geese onto the door panels, but as soon as he put them down, the geese slipped away as if they had grease on their feet. What to do? Suddenly, he remembered the ash kiln mound by the bamboo forest. He immediately pushed the door panels and rowed towards the flock of geese, finally managing to drive the geese onto the ash kiln mound.

The rain subsided a little. Junshui stood on the door panels and rowed towards the village. Before he reached the village, he heard people talking on a boat. It turned out to be production team leader Mujin and young man Chunjiang. Junshui shouted at the top of his lungs, "Save the geese!" When Mujin and Chunjiang heard that the geese had been found, it was as if a heavy stone had been lifted from their chests. They called out to Junshui, "Where are the geese?" Uncle Shui said, "At the ash kiln mound, hurry! Help drive them back!" The boat and the door panels bumped together. Junshui jumped onto the boat. Mujin and Chunjiang rowed vigorously, flying towards the ash kiln mound like an arrow. As dawn broke in the east, the boat approached the ash kiln mound. The flock of geese was on the mound with their heads buried in their backs, sleeping. Junshui gently pointed his finger and started counting. Suddenly, the geese scattered with a "wah" sound. Chunjiang grabbed two of them, and Mujin grabbed two as well. Chunjiang and Mujin put the geese they had caught into the boat and hurriedly went into the water. The two of them finally drove the geese back onto the mound and then carried them one by one into the cabin.

As the dawn gradually rose, they returned with the geese. The Party branch secretary, cadres, and commune members were still worried about the flock of geese that had been washed away by the flood last night. When everyone saw Junshui, Mujin, and Chunjiang rowing a boat full of geese back, they jumped up with joy, shouting, "The geese are back!" (Attached picture)

    鹅回来了
    广东普宁县南径公社社员　杨昭科
    两天来洪水包围了平洋村。俊水伯睡在楼棚上翻来复去，一闭眼就像看到他平日为公社养的鹅群，又像看到一只只小鹅出了蛋壳，心里乐滋滋的。突然，传来几声鹅叫，他像慈母听到婴儿的哭声一样，猛地爬起身来，倾耳细听，从呼啸的风雨声中又夹带着传来几声鹅叫。俊水伯忙划了根火柴，点亮那盏小船灯，正要下楼，俊水伯的老伴醒来了，她说：“半夜三更还不睡，要做什么啦！”俊水伯说：“别罗嗦！”可是老伴说：“书记说你二日二夜没有睡，叫你回来休息，你却身在家里心在鹅场……”俊水伯好像没有听见似地下楼去了。地下的水已淹过膝盖，他忙拆下两块门板用索捆在一起，匆匆取了一支竹竿，提着小船灯，推着门板出门去了。
    漆黑的夜，风猛雨暴，洪水汹涌，俊水伯全身的衣服早就湿漉漉了，门板不时被风雨吹打着东歪西歪。一阵大风把小船灯吹灭了，层层大浪险些把门板打翻，幸亏他是个识水性的人，把竿稳往了门板。正想继续向前，可是这伸手不见掌的黑夜，怎能辨别去向呢？俊水伯正在着急，突然从东畔竹林传来几声鹅叫，俊水伯真是喜出望外，借着闪电光直向竹林划去。啊！一群鹅出现在竹林下，他像见到宝贝一样，忙呼喊起来：“鹅鹅鹅，来来来！”可是，一阵风雨把鹅打得东摇西摆。怎样把鹅赶回去呢？他连忙把竹竿稳住门板，轻轻地溜下水去。水浸到脖子，他小心翼翼地朝鹅群游去，双手擒住了两只鹅，只听见风声和鹅叫声，其余的鹅都惊跑了。他忙把两只鹅拖上门板，刚刚放下，鹅像脚底抹了油似地又溜跑了。怎么办呢？突然，他想起了竹林边那个灰窑墩，马上撑着门板，向鹅群划去，好容易才把鹅群赶上了灰窑墩。
    雨小点了。俊水伯站在门板上向村里划去，未到村边，耳边就听见有人在船上谈话，原来是生产队长木锦和小伙子春江。俊水伯放开嗓子嚷着：“快救鹅呀！”木锦和春江一听鹅有了着落，像搬开压在胸上的大石似地，对着俊水伯叫道：“鹅在哪里？”水伯说：“在灰窑墩，快！帮忙赶回来！”船和门板碰在一起，俊水伯跳上小船，木锦和春江用力划着桨，像箭似地朝灰窑墩飞去。东方初露曙光，船靠近了灰窑墩，鹅群在墩上把头伏在背上睡了。俊水伯轻轻用手指着数起来。鹅突然哇地一声跑散了，被春江拖住两只，木锦也拖住两只。春江和木锦把拖住的鹅放在船里，连忙下水去了。两人终于把鹅赶回墩上，然后一个个地抱上船舱。
    当曙光渐渐上升的时候，他们载着鹅回来了。党支部书记、干部和社员们，还在为昨夜被洪水冲走的鹅群而着急。当大家看见俊水伯、木锦和春江三人划着一船鹅回来时，都高兴得跳起来，都嚷着：“鹅回来了！”（附图片）
