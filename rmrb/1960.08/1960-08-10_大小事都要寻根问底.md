When it comes to big things, we must follow the mass line; when it comes to small things, we must also follow the mass line. Once, the Songshu Management Area of Wanghe People's Commune in Qin County, Shanxi Province, sent a financial plan to the commune's Party committee. Liu Tingjing, the first secretary of the Party committee, felt that something was wrong the more he looked at it. Why would more than 15,700 yuan be spent on production expenses for more than 2,000 mu of land? So he found Sun Jinhua, the secretary of the Songshu Management Area branch, and asked him what the reason was. Sun Jinhua said, "To achieve a yield of 400 jin per mu, which is more than double last year's, we have to invest more!" "But have you considered that if you put in such a large cost, what kind of increased production is that?" "But there's really no other way, you can't get grain just by talking about it." "No, the main thing is that you haven't thought enough about the positive aspects, come on, I'll go with you and take a look."

After careful inspection and research with everyone, Liu Tingjing discovered two major problems: one was that too many low-yield crops were planted, with naked oats alone accounting for more than 700 mu, with a yield of only about 100 jin per mu, but the consumption of seeds alone was 18 or 19 jin per mu; the other was poor management of agricultural tools, resulting in excessive expenses. Therefore, through discussion at a meeting of commune members, the 700 mu of naked oats were changed to 400 mu of high-yield millet; all agricultural tools were inventoried and repaired, and a system of contracted use by the team was implemented to avoid unnecessary losses. In this way, production investment costs were reduced by 22% compared to the original plan. Subsequently, Liu Tingjing convened an on-site meeting here and promoted this experience throughout the commune. As a result, cost accounting was universally carried out in all management areas of the commune, and non-production expenditures were reduced by 5,700 yuan, management expenses were saved by 360 yuan, labor productivity was increased by 30%, and production investment was reduced by more than 38,000 yuan.

    大小事都要寻根问底
    大事情走群众路线，小事情也要走群众路线。一次，山西省沁源王和人民公社松树管理区给公社党委送来了一份财务计划表，党委第一书记刘廷静越看越觉得不对劲。为什么两千多亩土地，生产费用就用了一万五千七百元呢？他就找来松树管理区支部书记孙锦华，问他是什么原因？孙锦华说：“要实现亩产四百斤，比去年要提高一倍多，不多投资不行呀！”“可你考虑了没有，下了那么大成本，还算什么增产？”“可是也实在没个办法呀，反正光说是打不出粮食的。”“不，主要是从积极方面还想得少，走，我和你去看看。”
    刘廷静经过和大家一项一项仔细检查、研究，发现了两个大问题：一是低产作物种得太多，只莜麦一项就占了七百多亩，每亩收成才一百斤左右，可是，仅种子一项的消耗，每亩就得十八、九斤；一是农具管理不善，形成开支过大。于是，通过社员会议讨论，把七百亩莜麦改种了四百亩高产谷子；对所有农具进行了大清点、修理，并实行了以队包干使用的办法，避免无故的损失。这样，使生产投资费用比原计划降低了22％。接着，刘廷静在这里召开了现场会议，把这一经验在全公社推广，因此，这个公社的各个管理区普遍进行了成本核算，并压缩了非生产开支五千七百元，节约管理费用三百六十元，劳动生产率提高了30％，生产投资却减少了三万八千多元。
