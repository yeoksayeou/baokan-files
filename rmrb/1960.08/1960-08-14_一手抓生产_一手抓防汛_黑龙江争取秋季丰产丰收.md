Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 13th: Heilongjiang Province is currently in the busy season of spring wheat harvesting and the crucial period for strengthening field management of autumn crops. Simultaneously, the flood season for the province's rivers has arrived. The entire province is concentrating its efforts, under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, to grasp production with one hand and flood control with the other, ensuring a bumper harvest in the fields.

    Heilongjiang Province has mobilized 1.8 million strong laborers, along with a large number of mechanical and semi-mechanical harvesting tools, to overcome the difficulties caused by frequent rain and vigorously harvest spring wheat and flax. Currently, nearly 30% of the province's spring wheat has been harvested, and over half of the flax has been completed. At the same time, nearly 2 million people, with the spirit of "not stopping management until the grain is in hand," are weeding and urgently eliminating some weedy lands in the autumn fields, applying fertilizer, and conducting artificial pollination of corn, striving for high yields and bumper harvests in the autumn fields.

    Mulan County, a major grain-producing area, currently has 15,000 people engaged in artificial pollination of corn, striving for high corn yields. Huachuan County, a soybean-producing area, has adopted the method of specialized management of soybeans, with all soybean fields receiving a general application of fertilizer. In the Xinsheng Irrigation Area of Kedong County, among more than 3,000 mu of rice, due to excessive rain, insufficient sunshine, and low water temperatures, 1,000 mu have weak seedlings. This irrigation area has extracted more than 500 commune members and adopted shallow-water irrigation to raise the water temperature, allowing these seedlings to spike five or six days earlier, simultaneously with the first-class seedlings, and they are now growing well.

    On August 7th and 8th, the entire province experienced widespread torrential rains, and the water levels of the Songhua River, Nen River, and Heilongjiang River generally rose. While strengthening wheat harvesting and late-stage field management of autumn crops, various localities have also organized a 180,000-strong flood control team, which is reinforcing and consolidating the river embankments and urgently repairing dangerous sections. Large quantities of flood control materials are being transported to the embankment construction sites by road, rail, and water. In order to accelerate the dike construction project, flood control teams in Harbin and other places have also launched a technical innovation campaign. The "Red Flag Militia Division" of the Daowai Industrial Bureau in Harbin City used aerial cableways to extract soil and winches to pull boats, increasing the efficiency of soil extraction and transportation by four times. The flood control team in Zhaoyuan County reformed five types of flood control tools, such as soil transportation and tamping, totaling 720 pieces, increasing work efficiency by 50% compared to the original, greatly accelerating the progress of the project.

    一手抓生产　一手抓防汛
    黑龙江争取秋季丰产丰收
    新华社哈尔滨13日电　黑龙江省正值春小麦收割大忙和大秋作物急需加强后期田间管理的时期，全省江河的汛期又到来了。全省正集中人力，在各级党组织领导下，一手抓生产，一手抓防洪，确保农田丰产丰收。
    黑龙江全省集中了一百八十万强壮劳力，和大批机械和半机械的收割工具，克服多雨的困难，正大力抢收春麦和亚麻。现在全省已收春麦将近30％；亚麻已收完了二分之一以上。同时还有将近二百万人，以“粮食不到手，管理不罢休”的精神，正在秋田里拔除大草和突击消灭部分草荒地，追肥和进行苞米人工授粉，争取秋田高产丰收。
    主要产粮区木兰县现在有一万五千人在给苞米进行人工授粉，力争玉米高产。大豆产区桦川县采取专人突击管理大豆的办法，所有豆田都普遍追了一次肥。克东县的新生灌区三千多亩水稻中，由于雨多、日照少、水温低，有一千亩是弱苗。这个灌区抽出五百多名社员，采取了浅水灌溉、提高水温的办法，使这些禾苗提前五、六天，和一类苗同时抽穗，现在生长良好。
    7、8两日全省普遍下了暴雨，松花江、嫩江和黑龙江的水位普遍上涨。各地在加强麦收和秋收作物后期田间管理的同时，还组织了十八万人的防汛队伍，正在加高加固江河的堤防，抢修险要工段。大批防汛物资，正从公路、铁路和水上运往堤防工地。为了加快修堤工程，哈尔滨等地防汛队伍还开展了技术革新运动。哈尔滨市道外工业局的“红旗民兵师”，用空中滑车取土，利用卷扬机拉船，提高取土运土效率四倍。肇源县防汛队伍改革运土、打夯等防汛工具五种七百二十件，比原来提高工作效率50％，大大加快了工程进度。
