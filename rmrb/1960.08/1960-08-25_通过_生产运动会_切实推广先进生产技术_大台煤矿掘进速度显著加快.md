Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: Datian Coal Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau used the method of digging production games to fully mobilize the masses to promote key advanced production technologies, creating a production upsurge of catching up and surpassing, greatly improving production efficiency, and accelerating the digging speed. From January to July, the total digging footage exceeded the state plan by 33.28%, the digging work efficiency increased by 23.64% compared with the same period last year, and the average daily footage in the first ten days of August increased by 16.1% compared with the same period in July. Now, all mines under the Jingxi Mining Bureau are promoting the experience of Datian Coal Mine.

Many digging work surfaces of this mine have now become "arenas" for advanced technology competitions. Digging workers are catching up with each other in advanced technology competitions, showing their abilities. The digging team 23, which won the championship, applied various advanced experiences to the actual operation of drilling, blasting, bracing, and material transportation. Each shift formed two four-person combat teams, fixed on "two heads" for simultaneous digging. Other people formed a dedicated transport line to transport pit props and coal to these two teams. In this way, responsibilities were clear, materials were supplied in a timely manner, and the digging work efficiency was greatly improved, creating a mine-wide fastest digging record of 13.5 meters per head in eight hours. Digging team 20 was not to be outdone. They sent people to learn the advanced experience of team 23 and established an evaluation platform to write their own indicators and the indicators of team 23 on it, comparing them every day to encourage themselves. Finally, they created a mine-wide highest record of 1,140 meters per month. Other teams also launched an upsurge to learn from and catch up with team 23.

During the games, leading cadres such as the mine's Party Committee Secretary and the mine director went down the well to participate in production and direct production; transportation, mechanical and electrical, and ventilation workers also fought side by side with the digging workers. After the games, experience was summarized and exchanged through evaluation immediately, and widely promoted at the next games. After several rounds of competition, the digging efficiency of the entire mine increased rapidly by more than 40%. Currently, the average daily digging is 0.272 meters per worker, an increase of 17.24% compared with the beginning of the year. Pit prop consumption has also decreased by 23.26% compared with the beginning of the year, and safe production and the specifications and quality of the roadways are guaranteed.

The digging production games also promoted the complete set of advanced digging technologies and their rapid promotion. In the past, the digging teams in each coal roadway of this mine used manpower to carry pit props, which was very labor-intensive. More than half of the dozen or so workers per shift often had to transport pit props. In the games, workers created a material transport machine in the vertical shaft to replace manual back-carrying of materials. With only one or two people operating it, the material transport machine would transport bundles of pit props along the vertical shaft in the mine to the working surface dozens of meters high, greatly saving labor and man-hours. Digging team 20 found in the games that the labor organization within the team was not perfect, which could easily cause delays and affect digging efficiency. They learned team 23's method of fixing personnel, fixing work locations, fixing efficiency, and contracting tasks, and added new content of contracting quality and contracting safety, becoming the advanced method of "three fixings and three contracts," specifically assigning the team's tasks to each person, and launching a competition between shifts and individuals within the team, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of each worker and greatly improving digging efficiency. Digging team 23 immediately learned this experience from team 20. After the news of the mutual learning, learning from each other's strengths, and complementing each other's weaknesses between these two teams spread, the entire mine promoted their advanced organizational management methods, and the production management level of each team was generally improved. Currently, more than one-third of the digging teams in this mine are approaching the level of the most advanced digging team 23 in the entire mine.

Strengthening the Party's leadership and combining the hot production competition with in-depth and meticulous ideological work is the fundamental reason for the great achievements of this mine's production games. Since the beginning of this year, the production level of this mine has continued to rise, and the output of raw coal has exceeded the state plan every month. With the rapid increase in coal mining capacity, geological conditions have changed, the thick coal seams have decreased, and the thin coal seams have increased, resulting in a large digging volume and a small amount of coal obtained, resulting in an imbalance in production. In order to ensure the continued leap forward in future production, it is necessary to greatly accelerate the digging speed. To this end, the mine's Party Committee led all employees in March to launch a large-scale digging production game to promote the rapid adaptation of digging production to the needs of the mine's continued leap forward. After the games began, the core groups composed of Party members, League members, squad leaders, union group leaders, and veteran workers in each digging team met almost every day to analyze the situation, study problems, and when they discovered the workers' difficulties and problems, they sent special personnel to talk to the workers, providing specific help, and leading the masses with their own exemplary actions, educating backward workers to catch up. The mine's Party Committee continuously analyzed and solved the situations and problems in the development of the movement. In May of this year, the Party Committee discovered that some workers in backward teams had the idea of "anyway, they can't win the championship," so they did not strive for advancement; some workers in advanced teams had complacency, and immediately strengthened the ideological education of the workers; at the same time, they promptly improved the evaluation methods, so that groups with different foundations, different conditions, and different technical levels had the opportunity to obtain advanced titles through efforts, so that the production games in the entire mine were further developed.

### 通过“生产运动会”切实推广先进生产技术  大台煤矿掘进速度显著加快

    通过“生产运动会”切实推广先进生产技术
    大台煤矿掘进速度显著加快
    新华社23日讯　京西矿务局大台煤矿运用掘进生产运动会的方法，充分发动群众推广关键性的先进生产技术，掀起了你追我赶的生产热潮，大大提高了生产效率，加快了掘进速度。1到7月份的掘进总进尺超额33.28％完成了国家计划，掘进工效率比去年同期提高了23.64％，8月前十天的平均日进尺又比7月同期提高了16.1％。现在，京西矿务局所属各矿都在推广大台煤矿的经验。
    这个矿的许多掘进工作面，现在已经成为先进技术竞赛的“运动场”，掘进工人们在先进技术竞赛中你追我赶，各显其能。赢得冠军的掘进二十三组，把各种先进经验运用到钻眼、放炮、支架和运料的实际操作中去，每班组成两个四人战斗小组，分别固定在“两个头”同时掘进，其他人组成专门的运输线，给这两个小组运送坑木和运走煤炭。这样，责任明确，供料及时，掘进工效大大提高，创造了八小时每头掘进十三点五米的全矿最快掘进纪录。掘进二十组也不甘示弱，他们一面派人学习二十三组的先进经验，一面建立了一个评比台，把自己的指标和二十三组的指标写在上面，每天进行对比，来激励自己，终于创造了月进一千一百四十米的全矿最高纪录。其他各组也掀起了学赶二十三组的热潮。
    运动会中，矿党委书记、矿长等领导干部都下井参加生产、指挥生产；运输、机电、通风工人也和掘进工人协同作战。运动会结束之后，立即通过评比，总结和交流经验，在下一次运动会上普遍推广。经过几个回合的竞赛，全矿掘进效率迅速提高40％以上。目前平均每工每日掘进零点二七二米，比年初提高了17.24％，坑木消耗也比年初降低了23.26％，并且保证了安全生产和巷道的规格和质量。
    掘进生产运动会还促进了掘进方面的先进技术配套成龙，迅速推广。过去，这个矿各煤巷掘进组都是用人力背运坑木，劳动强度很大，每班十几个人经常要有一半以上的工人运坑木。在运动会中，工人们创造了在立井中代替人工背料的运料机，只要一两个人操纵，运料机就会把成捆坑木，沿着矿井中的立眼运到几十米高的工作面上，大大节约了劳力和工时。掘进二十组在运动会中发现组内劳动组织不够完善，容易造成窝工现象，影响掘进效率，他们学习了二十三组的定人员定工作地点定效率和包任务的方法，并增加了包质量包安全的新内容，成为“三定三包”的先进方法，把全组任务具体分配到每个人身上，并开展了组内的班与班、人与人之间的竞赛，使每个工人的积极性都充分调动起来，大大提高了掘进效率。掘进二十三组又立即学习二十组的这项经验。这两个组互相学习、取长补短的消息传出后，全矿都推广了他们的先进组织管理办法，使各组生产管理水平普遍提高。现在这个矿三分之一以上的掘进组，已接近全矿最先进的掘进二十三组的水平。
    加强党的领导，把热火朝天的生产竞赛和深入细致的思想工作结合起来，是这个矿生产运动会取得巨大成绩的根本原因。今年以来，这个矿的生产水平持续上升，原煤产量月月超额完成国家计划，在采煤能力迅速提高的情况下，地质条件发生了变化，厚煤层减少，薄煤层增加，形成掘进量大，获得煤量小，产生了生产不够平衡的现象。为了保证今后生产的持续跃进，必须大大加快掘进速度。为此，矿党委在3月间领导全矿职工，大搞掘进生产运动会，促进掘进生产迅速适应全矿持续跃进的需要。运动会开始后，各掘进组中由党员、团员、班长、工会组长、老工人组成的核心小组，几乎每天碰头分析情况，研究问题，发现工人的困难和问题，就派专人和工人谈心，具体帮助，并以自己模范行动带动群众，教育后进工人迎头赶上。这个矿的党委不断分析和解决运动发展中的情况和问题。今年5月，党委发现后进组有的工人中存在着“反正当不上冠军”的思想，因而力争先进不够；部分先进组的工人中又存在着自满情绪，立即加强了对工人们的思想教育；同时，及时改进评比方法，使基础不同、条件不同、技术水平不同的小组，经过努力，都有获得先进称号的机会，使全矿的生产运动会得到了进一步的发展。（附图片）
