Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: According to a report from the Indian News Bureau in New Delhi, Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated in the People's Assembly on the 20th that he had sent a telegram to Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba regarding the recent incident at the Leopoldville airport in Congo. In this telegram, he actually “expressed deep regret” over the incident.

The incident Prime Minister Nehru referred to occurred on the morning of the 18th when Congolese troops stationed at Leopoldville airport searching for Belgian spies ordered all personnel aboard a plane piloted by Indian personnel of the "UN forces" to disembark for inspection. They also fought back against a group of officers and soldiers from the Canadian contingent of the "UN forces" who refused the Congolese troops' demand to show their identification.

Prime Minister Nehru said that this incident was "unfortunate." He described the Congolese army's justified handling of the "UN forces'" Indian personnel in this incident as "unfriendly and rude treatment," which made him "extremely saddened."

When speaking in the Federal Assembly on August 17th, Nehru praised the US-manipulated United Nations intervention in Congo as "correct," "prompt and effective." According to the Indian Press Trust, India has already sent two groups of military personnel to Congo to carry out "UN forces" missions. The first group, sent on August 1st, consisted of thirty-six air force personnel, and the second group, sent on August 17th, consisted of twenty-eight army personnel.

    尼赫鲁赞扬美国利用联合国干涉刚果
    竟对刚果军队的正当行动表示遗憾
    新华社21日讯　据印度新闻处自新德里报道，印度总理尼赫鲁20日在人民院说，他已就最近在刚果首都利奥波德维尔机场发生的事件打电报给刚果总理卢蒙巴。他在这封电报中竟对这一事件“表示深深的遗憾”。
    尼赫鲁总理指的这次事件发生在18日上午，当时驻守利奥波德维尔机场搜查比利时间谍的刚果军队，命令一架搭乘由“联合国军”印度人员驾驶的飞机的全体人员下飞机以便进行检查，并反击了一批“联合国军”加拿大部队的军官和兵士拒绝刚果军队要他们出示证件的横蛮行为。
    尼赫鲁总理说，这次事件是“不幸的”。他把刚果军队对“联合国军”印度人员在这次事件中的正当处置说成是“受到的不友好和粗暴的待遇”，而使他“极为难过”。
    尼赫鲁8月17日在联邦院讲话时，曾经赞扬美国操纵下的联合国在刚果进行的干涉活动是“正确的”、“迅速而有效的”。据印度报业托辣斯说，印度已经派了两批军事人员前往刚果执行“联合国军”任务。8月1日派去的第一批是三十六名空军人员，8月17日派去的第二批是二十八名陆军人员。
