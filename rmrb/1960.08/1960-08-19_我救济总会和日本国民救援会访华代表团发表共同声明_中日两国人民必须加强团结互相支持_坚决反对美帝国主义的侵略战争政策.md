Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: Joint Statement of the China Relief Association and the Japan National Relief Association Delegation to China

    After receiving the first delegation of the Japan National Relief Association headed by Mr. Hideo Namba in May 1959, the China Relief Association invited the Japan National Relief Association to send a second delegation to the People's Republic of China for a friendly visit in 1960.

    The Japan National Relief Association dispatched a nine-member delegation headed by Mr. Mitsuo Okamoto, which arrived in China on July 19, 1960, for a visit.

    The Japan National Relief Association Delegation was received in Beijing by Mr. Chen Yi, Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and paid visits to Ms. Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the China Relief Association, and leaders of many other Chinese people's organizations, and held cordial talks.

    The China Relief Association and the Japan National Relief Association Delegation held friendly talks on issues such as their views on the current world situation, enhancing the friendly unity of the people of China and Japan, and strengthening cooperation between the two sides, and issued the following joint statement:

    (1) Both sides unanimously believe that the recent world situation is very favorable to peace-loving people. The struggle of the people of all countries against the imperialist policies of aggression and war and in defense of world peace has achieved a series of victories; the struggle of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries for national independence, democratic freedom has also continuously achieved new victories; the Japanese people have shown unprecedented awakening in the struggle to demand the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the removal of U.S. military bases and U.S. troops, and to strive for independence, peace, and democracy, and have achieved great victories, severely hitting the U.S. imperialist plot to stabilize the Asian front of aggression, and have made great contributions to the cause of defending world peace.

    However, U.S. imperialism has not learned a lesson from its failures and is still stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations and intensifying its support for Japanese militarism; the people of China and Japan must strengthen unity and mutual support, and resolutely struggle against the U.S. imperialist policies of aggression and war.

    (2) The Japan National Relief Association expresses gratitude and respect to the China Relief Association for its strong support and assistance to the victims of various repressions and natural disasters in Japan, and believes that this support and assistance is of great significance in alleviating the suffering of the victims, safeguarding the rights of the Japanese people, and inspiring the just struggle of the Japanese people.

    The China Relief Association stated: This association will, together with the Chinese people, resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle to demand the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the removal of U.S. military bases and U.S. troops, and to strive for independence, peace, and democracy; and give the highest evaluation to the efforts and contributions of the Japan National Relief Association in carrying out various relief activities in the above struggle.

    (3) The Japan National Relief Association Delegation stated: It is determined to fight with all its strength against the Japanese government's suppression of the Japanese people and acts of undermining democracy. The China Relief Association expressed its strong protest against the atrocities of U.S. imperialism and its Japanese agents in persecuting the Japanese people, expressed its greatest sympathy and condolences to the persecuted Japanese patriots, and will continue to provide possible support and assistance to the relief activities of the Japan National Relief Association.

    Both sides unanimously believe that through the above actions, the friendly unity of the people of China and Japan will be further enhanced and the cooperative relationship between the two sides will be strengthened, making a beneficial contribution to the cause of defending world peace.

    新华社18日讯　中国人民救济总会和日本国民救援会访华代表团共同声明
    在1959年5月接待了以难波英夫先生为首的日本国民救援会第一次访华代表团之后，中国人民救济总会又邀请了日本国民救援会于1960年再派代表团到中华人民共和国进行第二次友好访问。
    日本国民救援会派遣了以冈本光雄先生为团长的九人代表团，在1960年7月19日到达中国进行访问。
    日本国民救援会代表团在北京受到了中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅先生的接见，拜会了中国人民救济总会李德全副主席和许多其他中国人民团体的领导人，进行了亲切的交谈。
    中国人民救济总会和日本国民救援会代表团就对目前世界局势的看法、增进中日两国人民的友好团结和加强双方合作关系等问题举行了友好的会谈，并发表共同声明如下：
    （一）双方一致认为最近世界局势对爱好和平的人民非常有利。各国人民反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫世界和平的斗争取得了一系列的胜利；亚、非、拉丁美洲各国人民争取和维护民族独立、民主自由的斗争也不断取得了新的胜利；日本人民在要求废除日美“安全条约”、撤除美国军事基地和美国军队、争取独立、和平和民主的斗争中更表现了空前的觉醒，而且取得了伟大的胜利，严重打击了美帝国主义企图稳定亚洲侵略战线的阴谋，对保卫世界和平事业做出了巨大贡献。
    但美帝国主义没有从失败中取得教训，仍在加紧扩军备战，加紧扶植日本军国主义；中日两国人民必须加强团结和互相支持，对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策进行坚决的斗争。
    （二）日本国民救援会对于中国人民救济总会对日本人民遭受各种镇压的受害者和遭受自然灾难的受害者给予大力的支持和援助，表示感谢和敬意，并认为这种支持和援助对减轻受害者的痛苦、维护日本人民的权利和鼓舞日本人民的正义斗争具有重大的意义。
    中国人民救济总会表示：本会将和中国人民一起，坚决支持日本人民要求废除日美“安全条约”、撤除美国军事基地和美国军队、争取独立、和平和民主的正义斗争；对日本国民救援会在上述斗争中进行各种救援活动的努力和贡献给予极高的估价。
    （三）日本国民救援会代表团表示：对于日本政府镇压日本人民、破坏民主的行为，决心要以全力进行斗争。中国人民救济总会对美帝国主义及其日本代理人迫害日本人民的暴行表示了强烈的抗议，对遭受迫害的日本爱国人士寄予最大的同情和慰问，并对日本国民救援会的救援活动继续给予可能的支持和援助。
    双方一致认为，通过上述行动，将进一步增进中日两国人民的友好团结和加强双方合作关系，对保卫世界和平的事业做出有益的贡献。
