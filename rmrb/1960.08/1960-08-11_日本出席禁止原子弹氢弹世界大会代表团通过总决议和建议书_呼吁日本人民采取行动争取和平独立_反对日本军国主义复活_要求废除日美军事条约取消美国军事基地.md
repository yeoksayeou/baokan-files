Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 10th: The Japanese delegation to the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament passed a general resolution at the conference on the 9th. The full text is as follows:

The great march to eliminate the forces of war has already begun throughout the world, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The forces of war have also encountered resistance from the Japanese people and have lost their stable footing. The Japanese people’s struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has dealt a severe blow to the Far East military alliance plan concocted by the Japanese and American forces of war, and it is an inspiration and encouragement to the people of all countries in their struggle for peace.

The Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament has received the support of an unprecedented opposition to the "Security Treaty" struggle, both in scale and intensity, and has received the support of a massive peace march that has passed through military bases across the country.

Due to our direct experience with the U-2 Black Jet incident and the illegal implementation of the new "Security Treaty," as well as the discussions at this conference, we, the Japanese delegation participating in this World Conference, now fully recognize the true nature of the forces of war that disregard the desires of autonomous people for peace.

It is now clear that the revised U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the development of Japan's nuclear armament, and the dispatch of Japanese troops overseas are closely related, and they form the basis of a system for suppressing the Japanese people and the independent movements in Asia. We affirm that the forces that undermined the Paris East-West summit conference and intend to maintain and strengthen colonial rule in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are inextricably linked.

In addition, the forces of war are slandering the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs, accusing it of political bias, and attempting to split it. But this conference pointed out that stopping nuclear armament and eliminating the threat of nuclear war is precisely the implementation of morality and humanitarianism.

In addition, the forces of war are attempting to exploit the unfortunate situation of atomic bomb victims and are trying every means to exert political pressure on the activities of atomic bomb victims, thereby splitting this movement. Promoting the development of nuclear weapons is completely incompatible with rescuing victims.

We are fully aware that the revival of Japanese militarism is a serious threat to peace and security in the Far East.

We know that the only way to contribute to the security and peace of the Far East is to change Japan's political course in the direction of shattering the nuclear militarist system, abolishing the new "Security Treaty," banning atomic and hydrogen bombs, and achieving comprehensive disarmament. We oppose the resumption of nuclear tests and urgently demand an immediate agreement to ban testing. We demand a complete ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs and the achievement of a disarmament agreement aimed at comprehensive disarmament.

We oppose strengthening the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" and arming the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" with nuclear weapons, and we demand the cessation of U-2 and RB-47 spy plane flights, and demand the withdrawal of these reconnaissance planes from our country.

We demand the cancellation of U.S. military bases and that U.S. troops with nuclear weapons not be allowed to enter Japan. The Japanese government should formally reach an agreement with the U.S. government on this issue.

We demand the withdrawal of the Okinawa military base, which threatens peace and security in the Far East, and the immediate return of Okinawa to Japan.

We oppose the establishment of missile bases for the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" on Niijima and other islands.

We demand the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in Asia and the Pacific region, and demand that countries in Asia and the Pacific region conclude non-aggression treaties.

We demand a halt to the expansion of armaments and the stabilization and improvement of people's lives through social welfare—including free pensions. We demand genuine relief for atomic bomb victims, and for this purpose, we demand that the law on treatment be amended into a relief law. At the same time, we also demand the protection of the livelihoods of the bereaved families of atomic bomb victims. We strongly protest the illegal suppression of those who participated in the struggle against the "Security Treaty," and we demand an end to this suppression. We demand that the government abandon its nuclear militarist policy and make efforts to establish genuine friendly relations with countries such as the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. That is to say, we demand that the government stand on the basis of the Japanese Constitution and democracy and pursue a neutral policy. We also demand that the Ikeda Cabinet change its policies based on the new "Security Treaty," such as strengthening the "Control Law," immediately dissolve the Diet, and hold a referendum. We, the Japanese delegation attending the Sixth World Conference, oppose atomic and hydrogen bombs, demand comprehensive disarmament, and are determined to lead the Japanese people to fight to realize the above demands. We are deeply convinced that we can win victory through our own efforts.

The Japanese Delegation to the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament
August 9, 1960

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 10th: The Japanese delegation participating in the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament passed a recommendation on promoting the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs at the conference on the 9th, calling on the people of Japan to strengthen unity and strive for peace and independence through resolute struggle.

The recommendation pointed out: Today, the Japanese people are facing the dangers caused by the forces of war. The new "Security Treaty" military alliance will step up the transport of nuclear weapons into Japan, making the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" nuclear-armed. This has caused damage to Japanese fishing grounds, deprived farmers of their land, strengthened the suppression of the people's democratic rights, and heinously undermined the peace constitution. Now is the time for us to take action to strive for peace and independence, and to strive to take stable lives into our own hands.

The recommendation stated that if we remain silent and take no action, then we will become accomplices of the forces of war. Therefore, we must fight against those forces that impose policies on us that establish nuclear bases in our country, nuclearize the "Self-Defense Forces," and drag us into an atomic war.

The recommendation said: "Our movement is not a movement of a certain political party. However, this does not mean that our movement cannot have any relationship with political reality. On the contrary, precisely because the political reality is moving in the dangerous direction of dragging us into an atomic war, we must oppose policies aimed at implementing militarism."

"Experience has deeply convinced us that the struggle itself helps to enhance the understanding of many strata of the people and provides a basis for a nationwide movement. That is to say, workers are convinced through struggle that the only way to achieve victory is to closely unite with many other people and political parties."

"Another point has also been affirmed, that is: exposing the true nature of the forces of war will not hinder the development of the movement, but on the contrary, it can develop it by making the movement a truly mass movement's daily activity."

The recommendation emphasized: We must now draw a clear line between peace and war, and draw a clear line between democracy and fascism. For us, there is no neutral road, and there is no room for compromise. The recommendation calls for taking action with confidence and courage.

The recommendation said: "The conditions for the struggle for banning atomic and hydrogen bombs and striving for comprehensive disarmament, and for striving for democracy, peace, and independence have never been as favorable as they are now." "The struggle continues to expand and develop. Our future is bright."

"If we weaken our struggle even for a moment, the forces of war will launch a counterattack against us."

"We must persevere to the end and shoulder the great responsibility of freeing human life and our country from the danger of atomic war."

The recommendation also said: We must launch a resolute struggle to oppose the conspiracy to exploit the hard lives of atomic bomb victims, separate the relief movement from our movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, and further undermine our organizations.

"Now we must listen to the sad appeals of hundreds of thousands of atomic bomb victims in front of the monument, and we must vow to win the struggle to smash the military alliance preparing for atomic war - the new 'Security Treaty', while at the same time relieving atomic bomb victims and eliminating the possibility of atomic war."

The recommendation said: "Let us immediately start the task of implementing the international recommendations of the World Conference."

"We forcefully point out to you that peace will not come while we wait, we must strive for peace through our own struggle."

    日本出席禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会代表团通过总决议和建议书
    呼吁日本人民采取行动争取和平独立
    反对日本军国主义复活　要求废除日美军事条约取消美国军事基地
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：出席第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的日本代表团在9日的大会上通过了总决议。全文如下：
    排除战争势力的伟大进军已经在全世界，特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲开始展开。战争势力也遭到了日本人民的反抗，而且已经丧失它们稳定的立脚点。日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争给了日本和美国战争势力策划的远东军事同盟计划以严重的打击，它对世界各国人民争取和平的斗争是一个鼓舞和鼓励。
    第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会得到了不论在规模和强度上都是空前的反对“安全条约”斗争的支持，得到了走过全国各军事基地的声势浩大的和平游行的支持。
    由于我们直接经历了U—2型黑色喷气机事件和新“安全条约”的非法实施以及这次大会的讨论，我们，参加这次世界大会的日本代表团现在充分认识到漠视自主人民希望和平的意愿的战争势力的真正性质。
    现在已很清楚，修改后的美日“安全条约”、发展日本核武装和把日本军队派赴海外是有密切关系的，它构成镇压日本人民和亚洲独立运动的体系的基础。我们确认，破坏巴黎东西方最高级会议的势力和打算保持和加强在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的殖民统治的势力是不可分地联系在一起的。
    此外，战争势力正在诽谤反对原子弹和氢弹的运动，指责这个运动有政治偏见，并企图分裂它。但是这次大会指出，阻止核武装和消除核战争威胁正是道德和人道主义的实施。
    此外，战争势力正在企图利用原子弹受害者的不幸处境想尽办法来对原子弹受害者的活动施加政治压力，从而分裂这个运动。促进核武器的发展，同救援受害者是完全不相容的。
    我们完全知道，复活日本军国主义是对远东和平和安全的严重威胁。
    我们知道，要对远东的安全和和平作出贡献，唯一的办法是朝着粉碎核军国主义体系、废除新“安全条约”、禁止原子弹和氢弹以及全面裁军的方向改变日本的政治路线。我们反对恢复核试验，并且迫切要求立即达成禁止试验的协议。我们要求全面禁止原子弹和氢弹，达成旨在全面裁军的裁军协议。
    我们反对加强日本“自卫队”和用核武器武装日本“自卫队”，我们要求停止U—2型和RB—47型间谍飞机的飞行，要求这些侦察飞机撤离我国。
    我们要求取消美国的军事基地，不准拥有核武器的美国军队进入日本。日本政府应当同美国政府就这个问题正式达成协议。
    我们要求撤走威胁着远东和平与安全的冲绳岛军事基地，立即把冲绳岛归还日本。
    我们反对在新岛和其它岛屿建立日本“自卫队”的导弹基地。
    我们要求在亚洲和太平洋地区建立无核武器地区，要求亚洲和太平洋区域的国家缔结互不侵犯条约。
    我们要求停止扩充军备，通过社会福利——包括无偿的退休金——来稳定和改善人民的生活。我们要求名副其实地救援原子弹受害者，并且为此把关于治疗的法律修改成为救援法。同时我们还要求保护原子弹受害者遗族的生计。我们强烈抗议对那些参加反对“安全条约”斗争的人们进行非法镇压，我们要求制止这种镇压。我们要求政府放弃核军国主义的政策，为同苏联和中华人民共和国等国家建立真正的友好关系而作出努力。这也就是说，要求政府站在日本宪法和民主的基础上，奉行中立的政策。我们还要求池田内阁改变它以新“安全条约”为基础的政策，如加强“控制法”等；立即解散国会，举行公民投票。我们出席第六届世界大会的日本代表团反对原子弹和氢弹，要求全面裁军，并且决意要引导日本人民为实现上述要求进行斗争。我们深信，我们能通过自己的努力赢得胜利。
    第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会日本代表团
                                              1960年8月9日
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：参加第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的日本代表团，在9日的大会上通过了关于促进反对原子弹和氢弹运动的建议书，呼吁日本全国人民加强团结，通过坚决的斗争，来争取和平和独立。
    建议书指出：今天，日本人民正面临着战争势力所引起的危险。新“安全条约”军事同盟将加紧把核武器运入日本，使日本“自卫队”核武装化。这造成了对日本渔场的破坏，剥夺了农民的土地，加强了对人民民主权利的压制和罪恶昭彰地破坏和平宪法。现在是我们采取行动争取和平和独立，争取自己掌握稳定的生活的时候了。
    建议书说，如果我们保持沉默，不采取行动，那么，我们就将成为战争势力的同谋者。因此，我们必须同那些把在我国建立核基地、使“自卫队”核武器化和把我们卷入原子战争中去的政策强加在我们身上的势力作斗争。
    建议书说：“我们的运动不是某一个政党的运动。但是，这并不意味着我们的运动不能同政治现实发生任何关系，相反地，正是由于现实中的政治是朝着把我们卷入原子战争的危险走的，因此，我们才必须反对旨在实行军国主义的政策。”
    “经验使我们深信，斗争本身有助于提高人民的许多阶层的理解，并为全国范围的运动提供了基础。这就是说，工人通过斗争而确信，取得胜利的唯一办法是同其他许多人民和政党紧密地团结在一起。”
      “还有一点也已经肯定下来，那就是：揭露战争势力的真正性质不会妨碍运动的发展，而是恰恰相反，通过使运动成为真正群众性运动的日常活动，就能使它得到发展。”
    建议书强调说：我们现在要划清和平与战争之间的界线，要划清民主和法西斯主义之间的界线，对我们来说，中立道路是没有的，也没有妥协的余地。建议书要求充满信心和勇气来采取行动。
    建议书说：“为禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军，为争取民主、和平和独立而进行的斗争的条件从来没有像现在这样有利。“斗争在继续扩大和发展。我们的前途是光明的。
    “如果我们那怕只是一时削弱我们的斗争，战争势力就将对我们进行反攻。
    “我们必须坚持到底担负起使人类生命和我们的国土摆脱原子战争危险的莫大职责。”
    建议书还说：我们必须展开坚决的斗争，来反对利用原子弹受害者的艰苦生活、使救援运动同我们禁止原子弹氢弹运动分裂开来和进一步破坏我们的组织的阴谋。
    “现在我们必须倾听成千上万的原子弹受害者在纪念碑前发出的悲痛的呼吁，并且誓必要赢得粉碎准备原子战争的军事同盟——新‘安全条约’的斗争，同时要救济原子弹受害者和消灭原子战争的可能性。”
    建议书说：“让我们立即着手使世界大会的国际建议付诸实施的任务。”
    “我们有力地向你们指出，在我们等待的时候，和平是不会到来的，我们必须通过自己的斗争来争取和平。”
