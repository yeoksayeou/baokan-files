Concentrate Forces to Vigorously Develop Agriculture and Ensure Increased Grain Production in the Autumn Harvest

Jinan Sends 40,000 Cadres Deep into the Front Lines to Meet at Production Teams

16,000 Leading Backbone Personnel Take on Deputy Positions in Production Teams, Laboring and Working Simultaneously to Help Solve Key Problems

(Reported by this newspaper) According to Shanxi Daily: In the Jinan area of Shanxi Province, over 40,000 leading cadres have gone to production teams, and more than 16,000 leading backbone personnel have taken on positions as deputy team leaders and canteen managers, vigorously developing agriculture and grain production.

The large-scale movement of cadres in the Jinan area to production teams, taking on roles as deputy team leaders and canteen managers, represents a further development of the "two-five system" leadership method promoted by cadres going deep into rural areas to participate in and lead agricultural production, and to improve summer agricultural production work. In early June, the Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized the experiences of cadres participating in and leading production, and rectified the cadre ranks. On this basis, 70% of the cadres from the prefectural and county levels and 80% to 90% of the cadres from the commune and management district levels were drawn out, totaling 45,600 cadres (including 72 prefectural and county Party secretaries, over 4,800 commune and management district secretaries, and over 5,000 members of the four-level Party committees), to jointly converge on production teams, fields, and canteens, to focus on production and livelihood, vigorously develop agriculture, and develop grain production. To help production teams do a good job in overall work, arrange labor and agricultural tasks, manage fields, and improve the leadership level of production teams, 15,760 leading backbone personnel were drawn from the prefectural, county, commune, and management district levels to serve as deputy team leaders and canteen managers. Currently, except for 20% of the production teams with relatively strong leadership backbone personnel, which did not have cadres assigned to deputy positions, 80% of the production teams have cadres assigned to deputy positions.

After a large number of leading backbone personnel went deep into the front lines to take on deputy positions, they generally adopted the method of participating in production to lead production. On the one hand, they actively labored, and on the other hand, they helped the production teams solve many pressing and specific problems, greatly strengthening the agricultural front. In June and July, county, commune, and management district cadres worked a total of more than 1.74 million workdays, an average of 45 days per person, equivalent to the total number of workdays from January to May. Comrade Zhao Yuting, First Secretary of the Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Comrade Geng Xing, First Secretary of the Linfen County Party Committee, helped production teams in Dengzhuang Commune, Linfen County, to establish and improve Party organization activities, and rapidly promoted the work of establishing and improving Party branches and Party groups in about 90% of the production teams throughout the area, further exerting the combat role of Party organizations in striving for increased agricultural production. With the help of the assigned cadres, more than 20,000 canteens throughout the area underwent general rectification one to several times, and planned grain use was universally implemented. With better canteens, the enthusiasm of the commune members was even higher.

After a large number of leading backbone personnel went deep into the front lines to take on deputy positions, all 198 commune-level agency canteens throughout the area were closed, and all cadres sent to the countryside and cadres from the commune and management district levels ate in farmers' canteens. The bureaucratic work style of communes and management districts was greatly overcome. Due to the streamlining of institutions, communes and management districts freed up a large number of offices to establish canteens and other welfare undertakings for production teams. Meetings, documents, and reports were also greatly reduced. According to statistics from 18 communes, meetings in July decreased by 75% compared to the previous six months, documents decreased by 87%, and reports decreased by 90%.

After a large number of leading backbone personnel went deep into the front lines to take on deputy positions, through practice, they also summarized a new set of leadership methods and work experiences, such as the "two-eight system nested with two-six system" and the "three helps" and "three skills."

The "two-eight system nested with two-six system" is: In every ten days, two days are used to study, arrange work, and organize learning, and eight days are spent going deep into the front lines. In the eight days spent deep in the front lines, six days are spent squatting in one location and two days are spent rotating to different areas.

The "three helps" are: All cadres sent to the countryside help production teams do a good job in field management; help production teams do a good job in arranging labor and agricultural tasks; and help production teams do a good job in overall work, both in production and livelihood.

The "three skills" are: Skillfully arrange agricultural tasks, focus on key fields, promote backward fields, comprehensively arrange everything, and consider general fields; skillfully use labor, fully tap the labor potential in all aspects, strengthen the agricultural front, vigorously promote tool reform, fix operational groups, set basic workdays, and set labor quotas; skillfully lead by grasping the five characters of "do, touch, grasp, discuss, and learn," that is, "do" comes first, participating in production to lead production, "touching" the bottom of the work and grasping the actual situation, "grasping" the key problems, "discussing" everything with the masses, and "learning" Party instructions and newspapers.

    集中力量大办农业  保证秋收粮食增产
    晋南四万干部深入第一线会师生产队
    一万六千领导骨干到生产队担任副职，边劳动边工作帮助解决关键问题
    本报讯　据山西日报消息：山西省晋南区四万多名领导干部会师生产队，一万六千多名领导骨干，担任了生产队副队长、食堂事务长，大办农业，大办粮食。
    晋南区大批干部会师生产队，担任副队长和事务长，是广大干部深入农村，推行“二五制”领导方法的进一步发展。6月初，中共晋南地委总结了干部参加生产领导生产，做好夏季农业生产工作的经验，整顿了干部队伍。在这个基础上，从地、县两级抽出70％的干部，从公社、管理区两级抽出80％至90％的干部，共抽出四万五千六百多名干部（其中地、县委书记七十二人，公社、管理区书记四千八百多人，四级党委委员五千多人），共同会师到生产队、到田间、到食堂，抓生产，抓生活，大办农业，大办粮食。为了帮助生产队做好全面工作，做好劳力、农活安排和田间管理等工作，提高生产队的领导水平，地、县、公社、管理区四级抽出一万五千七百六十名领导骨干，担任了生产队副队长和食堂事务长。目前，全区除20％的领导骨干较强的生产队没有下放干部担任副职外，80％的生产队，队队都有下放干部担任副职。
    大批领导骨干深入前线担任副职后，普遍采取了参加生产领导生产的方法，一方面积极劳动，一方面帮助生产队解决了许多迫切而又具体的问题，大大加强了农业战线。6、7两月，县、公社、管理区干部共做劳动日一百七十四万多个，每人平均四十五个，等于1至5月份所做劳动日的总和。中共晋南地委第一书记赵雨亭同志和临汾县委第一书记庚星同志在临汾县邓庄公社帮助生产队建立和健全党组织的活动，并且迅速推动了全区90％左右的生产队建立和健全党支部和党小组的工作，进一步发挥了党组织在争取农业增产中的战斗作用。在下放干部的帮助下，全区两万多个食堂普遍整顿了一至数次，普遍推行了计划用粮。食堂办得更好了，社员的干劲更高了。
    大批领导骨干深入前线担任副职后，全区一百九十八个公社机关食堂全部停了火，全部下乡干部和公社、管理区干部都到农民食堂吃饭。公社和管理区机关化作风大有克服，公社、管理区由于机构精简，腾出了大批办公室为生产队办了食堂等福利事业。会议、文件、表报也大大减少，据十八个公社统计，7月份会议比前六个月减少75％，文件减少87％，表报减少90％。
    大批领导骨干深入前线担任副职后，通过实践，还总结出二八制套二六制、三帮、三巧等一套新的领导方法和工作经验。
    二八制套二六制是：每十天中，两天研究、安排工作和组织学习，八天深入第一线。在深入第一线的八天中，六天蹲点、两天转面。
    三帮是：所有下乡干部，都帮助生产队做好田间管理；帮助生产队做好劳力、农活安排；帮助生产队做好全面工作，既搞好生产，又搞好生活。
    三巧是：巧安排农活，抓住重点田，促进落后田，全面安排，兼顾一般；巧使用劳力，充分挖掘各方面的劳动潜力，加强农业战线，大闹工具改革，固定作业小组，定基本劳动日，定劳动定额；巧领导，抓干、摸、抓、商、学五个字，即干字当先，参加生产领导生产，摸清工作底子，掌握实际情况，抓环节问题，一切事情同群众商量，学习党的指示和报纸。（附图片）
