    "Living Eight Immortals" Display Great Magical Powers
    Our reporters Mi Rongyun, Yuan Dongyi, Li Yushan
    Zhao Bazhuang Commune, located on both banks of the Hutuo River in Shulu County, Hebei Province, is a place with sandy and white soil and prone to drought and floods. Half of the commune's land is hardpan (black clay) sandy beach, which is prone to drought in spring and flooding in autumn. The masses have a saying: "Hutuo River, sandy beach, wet in heavy rain, dry in light rain, nine years out of ten are lean years." Therefore, the yield has not been high for many years, and the word "poor" has never been removed. However, since the communization in 1958, earth-shaking changes have taken place here. Last year, the average grain yield per mu was 333 jin, an increase of 23% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958; cotton production increased by more than 64%. The entire commune has transformed from a grain-deficient commune to a surplus-grain commune. This year, people have overcome the threat of more than 300 days of drought, and autumn crops are growing well, with a large increase in production expected. Only two years apart, such a big change has taken place. What is the reason? If you ask the commune members, they will tell you: under the illumination of the general line's beacon, villages and teams have "Living Eight Immortals" who implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture."

        The Origin of the "Living Eight Immortals"
    In September last year, the Shulu County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to strive for the top in the province's overproduction competition, issued a battle call to the people of the county: "Resolutely seize a bumper harvest in autumn." After this call reached Zhao Bazhuang Commune, it was immediately met with enthusiastic response from the vast number of cadres and the masses. What measures should be taken to achieve the overproduction plan? In order to solve this problem, the commune Party committee went to various production teams to "learn from experience." Comrade Zhou Jinlin, First Secretary of the Zhao Bazhuang Commune Party Committee, discovered from in-depth investigation of the experiences of Zhao Bazhuang and Shiqiaotou production teams that there were significant differences in production results due to different methods and measures for implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and promoting new technologies.

    Ren Fazhen, secretary of the Party branch of Zhao Bazhuang Production Team, attached great importance to summarizing and promoting new technologies. Since the winter of 1958, they have organized production experts in soil improvement of hardpan and sandy land, well digging, tool innovation, seed selection, and close planting, according to the technical expertise of the commune members, to strengthen technical guidance. In more than a year, they improved 430 mu of soil by filling sand with black soil and suppressing alkali with sand, drilled 32 machine wells, and promoted new technologies such as improved varieties and close planting of wheat. Last year, the average wheat yield per mu was more than 180 jin, an increase of 24% compared with 1958. However, Shiqiaotou Production Team, with the same natural conditions as Zhao Bazhuang Production Team, did not conscientiously implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and summarize and promote new technologies. Last year, the average wheat yield per mu was only 120 jin. This made the commune Party committee clear about one thing: for production, hard work alone is not enough; it is necessary to attach importance to summarizing and promoting the new technologies of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." If the production level of Zhao Bazhuang Production Team in implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" and promoting new technologies could be transformed into the social production level, and the advanced experience of technical experts could be transformed into the experience of all commune members, the production level could be greatly improved. The commune Party committee decided to start with mobilizing the masses to summarize the experience of bumper harvests, select pacesetters for implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and transform the learn-from-and-catch-up-with-the-advanced movement into a mass movement for implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and popularizing new technologies. Therefore, in conjunction with the field crop inspection and evaluation work, with "good politics, good labor, expertise, willingness to study, and creativity" as conditions, through mobilizing the masses, and according to the eight characters of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" – water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density, protection, tools, and management – pacesetters were selected in eight aspects throughout the commune.

    The establishment of agricultural "Eight-Point Charter" pacesetters greatly encouraged the commune members. It was truly a mass movement with boiling enthusiasm and much discussion. Some said: "Peasants are not simple; now you have to be a 'real Eight Immortal.'" Others said: "Every profession produces a champion; it depends on whether you do it or not."

        One Flower Blooms, Many Fruits Result
    As the saying goes, "A single strand of silk does not make a thread, a single tree does not make a forest." Although the eight-character pacesetters played a key leading role in summarizing and imparting new technologies and new experiences, because individual activities had a small scope and knowledge was limited, they could not concentrate and disseminate the wisdom and experience of the masses on a larger scale. In order to make the popularization of science and technology compatible with large-scale production, during the autumn harvest and wheat planting season, in coordination with the large-scale construction of high-yield plots, the commune Party committee proposed the slogan "Eight Characters Enter the Plots, Groups are Built in Every Plot, Pacesetters Become a Line, and the Advanced Become a Group." Each production team took the eight-character pacesetters as the core, absorbed more than 3,600 experienced farmers and active production members with expertise in various fields, and established "Eight-Point Charter" research groups at all levels, so that the popularization of science and technology and the promotion of production competition were organically combined.

    The mass movement of widely establishing "Eight-Point Charter" pacesetters quickly made all aspects of the commune's work show a new situation of "contending for excellence, full of color." The "Water" character pacesetter group of Mi Fujin of Zhao Bazhuang Production Team, in order to speed up the well-digging speed, collectively studied and improved the scaffolding method and well-drilling technology, creating a new record for rapid well-digging. The commune Party committee promptly promoted the advanced experience of the "Water" character pacesetter group of Mi Fujin in the entire commune, which accelerated the well-digging speed of the entire commune by one-third. In April this year, it was the busy season for drought-resistant sowing and drought-resistant wheat irrigation, but some drainage and irrigation machinery stopped due to lack of fuel. Ren Fazhen, secretary of the Party branch of Zhao Bazhuang Production Team, personally took command, with the "Tool" character pacesetter group of Jiao Bingcang and Wang Zhangheng as the backbone, and absorbed the support of the "Water" character pacesetter group, to attack the fuel problem. As a result, three major technological innovations were successfully tested: the use of coal stove engine plus blower to burn white coal, and the use of coal balls instead of large briquettes. After the three major technical experiences were promoted throughout the commune, the drainage and irrigation machinery quickly started operating, effectively ensuring the water supply needed for drought-resistant wheat irrigation. In this way, the entire commune relied on pacesetters and the vast number of active production members to go from one red spot to overall red. In the past winter and this spring, the entire commune completed the improvement of more than 13,600 mu of soil, drilled 49 new machine wells, reformed 37 types and 5,000 pieces of various tools, and made the popularization rate of improved varieties of various crops reach more than 70%, and more than two-thirds of the spring and summer sown crops promoted reasonable close planting and new technologies. With the development of the learning, catching up, and surpassing movement, this scientific team quickly grew stronger. By the end of July, statistics showed that the number of people in the entire commune who were rated as "Eight-Character Pacesetters" reached more than 1,900.

        Mutual Collaboration Among the Eight Characters
    The "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" is an organic whole. Each character has its own division of labor, but they are interdependent and inseparable. According to the agricultural season and the different needs of various crop growth stages, the Zhao Bazhuang Commune Party Committee determined the focus of work in a timely and appropriate manner, and other links cooperated with the central work to serve the center. After the entire commune completed the summer harvest and summer planting tasks in early July, the commune Party committee shifted the focus of work to field management. In order to manage various crops meticulously and well, the commune's "Eight-Point Charter" Guidance Committee proposed "Management as the Command, Protection, Water, Fertilizer, and Tools to Serve Management." Dajiazhuang Production Team established a field management committee, and organized pacesetters, experienced farmers, and active production members into management groups according to crops, to study the management techniques of various crops and provide management measures and suggestions to the management groups in a timely manner. The Management Committee then uniformly and rationally allocated labor according to the size of the task, the urgency of agricultural work, and the level of technology, and organized planned operations. After the cotton was ridged, the branches and leaves grew long, and the late-stage management operations were frequent, which easily caused the cotton branches to collide and get injured. The cotton management group researched the management method of continuous operation of four processes: pruning, topdressing, pest control, and watering. The Management Committee adopted their opinions and formulated a management plan. The commune members who pruned carried fertilizer bags with them, and combined pruning with topdressing weak seedlings. After pruning, they immediately controlled pests, and finally watered the land. In this way, one link followed another, cooperating and collaborating, making all the work done quickly and well.

        Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods to Popularize and Improve
    The process of promoting new technologies is also the process of struggle between new and old ideas. In order to improve the scientific and technical level of the masses, it is necessary to closely combine the practical experience of the masses with science and technology in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. In solving this problem, Zhao Bazhuang Commune adopted the following three methods: First, for a certain agricultural work, in order to unify specifications and quality, the method of concentrating pacesetter experts and holding on-site technical demonstration competitions was adopted to impart new technologies. For example, during cotton sowing, the entire commune concentrated 174 pacesetter experts in furrow opening and seeding to hold a sowing technology demonstration competition, spreading new sowing technologies, making this year's cotton sowing fast and good. Second, each team's "Eight-Point Charter" pacesetter group was linked to the commune's agricultural science research institute. Technicians from the commune's research institute regularly imparted technical experience to the eight-character pacesetters. This year, four new technology dissemination meetings were held on cotton management, enabling the vast number of commune members to learn new technologies such as sowing, seedling setting, comprehensive pest control, pruning and side-shoot removal, picking defeated flowers after rain, and shaking cotton plants. Third, for production teams with poor technology, the method of combining the Party committee, technicians, and pacesetters to hold "on-site consultations" was adopted to help overcome weak links in a focused manner. Dajiazhuang, Beiliuzhuang and other production teams lacked sweet potato seedling raising technology, and the number of sweet potato seedlings was insufficient every year. In order to help them overcome the difficulty of seedling raising, the commune Party committee absorbed Liu Laotang and other experts from Southeast Liuzhuang to conduct on-site consultations. After research, the technology of "disinfecting seeds with warm water and agents, and rebuilding the cultivation kang" was promoted, and the sweet potato seedlings were cultivated very well. The masses compiled a jingle saying: New technology, a flower, cannot be separated from it everywhere; rely on it to overcome nature, and grain and cotton production will increase.

    “活八仙”大显神通
    本报记者　米荣运、袁东义、李玉山
    位于滹沱河两岸的河北省束鹿县赵八庄公社，是个土地沙白、旱涝多灾的地方。全社土地有一半是板地（黑粘土）沙滩，春易旱，秋易涝。群众流传着“滹沱河，沙土滩，大雨湿，小雨干，十年就有九年歉”的传说。因而历年来产量不高，穷字总没有摘掉。可是从1958年公社化以后，这里却发生了翻天覆地的大变化。去年粮食平均亩产三百三十三斤，比大跃进的1958年提高23％；棉花产量增长了64％以上。全社由历年缺粮社一跃变为余粮社。今年，人们战胜了三百多天干旱的威胁，秋田作物生长良好，增产大有希望。仅仅两年相隔，就发生这样大的变化，原因何在？如果问到社员，他会告诉你：在总路线的灯塔照耀下，村村队队有了执行农业“八字宪法”的“活八仙”。
        “活八仙”的由来
    去年9月间，中共束鹿县委为了在全省超产竞赛中争上游，向全县人民提出了“坚决夺取秋季大丰收”的战斗号召。这个号召传到了赵八庄公社以后，马上得到广大干部群众的热烈响应。采取什么措施实现超产计划呢？为了解决这个问题，公社党委便分头到各生产队去“取经”。中共赵八庄公社党委第一书记周进林同志，从深入到赵八庄和石桥头生产队摸经验中发现：因为对贯彻农业“八字宪法”、推广新技术的办法和措施不同，生产效果有很大的差异。
    赵八庄生产队党支部书记任发振，非常重视总结推广新技术。从1958年冬，他们就按照社员技术专长，把全队改造板沙地、打机井、改革工具、选种、密植等生产能手，组织起来，加强技术指导。一年多的时间，就用黑土填沙、以沙压碱的办法，改良土壤四百三十亩，打成机井三十二眼，还推广了良种和小麦密植新技术，去年的小麦平均亩产一百八十多斤，比1958年增长了24％。可是石桥头生产队，和赵八庄生产队自然条件相同，就是没有认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”，总结推广新技术，去年的小麦平均亩产只有一百二十斤。这使公社党委明确了一个问题：搞生产，只凭苦干还不行，必须重视总结推广农业“八字宪法”新技术。如果能把赵八庄生产队贯彻“八字宪法”推广新技术的生产水平变成社会生产水平，把技术能手的先进经验变成全体社员的经验，就能把生产水平大大提高一步。公社党委决定从发动群众总结丰收经验入手，选拔贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”标兵，把学赶超先进运动，变成贯彻农业“八字宪法”普及新技术的群众运动。于是，结合大田作物检查评比工作，以“政治好，劳动好，有专长，肯钻研，有创造”等为条件，通过发动群众，按照农业“八字宪法”水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管八个字，在全社评选八个方面的标兵。
    农业“八字宪法”标兵的树立，使社员受到很大鼓舞，真是群众沸腾，议论纷纷。有的说：庄稼人，不简单，如今要当“真八仙”。也有的说：行行出状元，看你干不干。
        一处开花遍地结果
    俗话说：“单丝不成线，孤树不成林”，八字标兵虽然在总结传授新技术新经验中起到骨干带头作用，因为单人活动范围小，知识有限度，却不能在更大的范围内把群众的智慧、经验集中起来，传播出去。为了使普及科学技术与大规模生产相适应，秋收种麦时，配合大搞丰产方建设，公社党委便提出了“八字进方，方方建组，标兵成列，先进成群”的口号。各个生产队都以八字标兵为核心，吸收各方面有专长的老农和生产积极分子三千六百多人，层层建立“八字宪法”研究小组，使普及科学技术与推动生产竞赛有机结合起来。
    广树“八字宪法”标兵的群众运动，使全社各项工作很快出现了一个“争奇斗巧，万紫千红”的新局面。赵八庄生产队秘福进“水”字标兵组，为了加快打机井速度，集体钻研，改进搭架方法和钻井技术，创造了快速打井新纪录。公社党委及时在全社推广了秘福进“水”字标兵组打机井的先进经验，使全社打机井速度加快三分之一。今年4月，正是抗旱播种、抗旱浇麦的紧张季节，可是有些排灌机械因缺乏燃料停了车。赵八庄生产队党支部书记任发振，亲自挂帅，以焦丙山、王章恒“工”字标兵组为骨干，吸收“水”字标兵组支援，猛攻燃料关，结果试验成功了锅驼机加鼓风机浇白煤、用煤球代替大砟煤等三项技术大革新。全社推广了这三大技术经验以后，排灌机械很快都开动起来，有效地保证了抗旱浇麦的供水需要。全社就是这样，依靠标兵和广大生产积极分子由一点红，到全面红。在去冬今春，全社完成改良土壤一万三千六百多亩，新打机井四十九眼，改革各种工具三十七种、五千多件，并使各种作物优种普及面积达到70％以上，有三分之二以上的春夏播作物推广了合理密植和新技术。随着学、赶、超运动的发展，这支科学队伍迅速壮大起来。到7月底统计，全社被评为“八字标兵”的人数达到一千九百多人。
        八字之间互相协作
    “八字宪法”，是一种有机整体。字字之间各有分工，但又互相依存，密不可分。赵八庄公社党委根据农事季节和各种作物生长阶段不同需要，因时、因地制宜确定工作中心，其它各个环节与中心工作配合，为中心服务。7月上旬全社完成夏收夏种任务后，公社党委就把工作重点转向田间管理。为了把各种作物管细管好，公社“八字宪法”指导委员会便提出“管字挂帅，保、水、肥、工为管字效劳”。大贾庄生产队建立田间管理委员会，并将各路标兵、老农、生产积极分子，按作物组成管理小组，分头研究各种作物管理技术，及时向管理组提供管理措施和建议。管委会则按照任务大小，农活急缓，以及技术高低，统一合理搭配劳力，组织计划作业。棉花封垅后，因棵枝长大，后期管理作业频繁，容易使棉枝碰撞受伤。棉花管理小组研究出了整枝、追肥、除虫、浇水四道工序连续作业的管理方法。管委会采纳了他们的意见，制定了管理规划。整枝的社员随身携带化肥袋，整枝结合给弱棵追肥，整枝后，紧跟着除虫，最后放水灌溉，这样一环扣一环，配套协作，使各项活计做得又快又好。
      土洋结合普及提高
    推广新技术的过程，也是新旧思想斗争的过程。为提高群众的科学技术水平，必须把群众实践经验和科学技术紧密结合起来，才能收到事半功倍的效果。在解决这个问题上，赵八庄公社采取了以下三种办法：第一，对某种农活，为了统一规格质量，采取集中标兵能手，举行现场技术表演赛的办法，传授新技术。如棉花播种时，全社集中了一百七十四名扶耧标兵能手，举行播种技术表演赛，传播了播种新技术，使今年棉花播种又快又好。第二，各队“八字宪法”标兵组与公社农业科学研究所挂钩。公社研究所技术员定期向八字标兵传授技术经验。今年在棉花管理上，就举行了四次新技术传授会，使广大社员学会了播种、定苗、综合治虫、整枝打杈、雨后摘败花、摇棉棵等新技术。第三，对技术较差的生产队，采取党委、技术员、标兵三结合，用举行“现场会诊”的办法，有重点地帮助攻克薄弱环节。大贾庄、北留庄等生产队，因缺乏甘薯育秧技术，历年薯秧不足，公社党委为帮助他们度过育秧难关，吸取东南留育秧能手刘老堂等到现场会诊，经过研究，推行了“温水药剂浸种消毒，改建培育炕”的技术后，薯秧培育得很好。群众编顺口溜说：新技术，一枝花，处处不能离开它；靠它战胜大自然，粮棉增产有办法。
