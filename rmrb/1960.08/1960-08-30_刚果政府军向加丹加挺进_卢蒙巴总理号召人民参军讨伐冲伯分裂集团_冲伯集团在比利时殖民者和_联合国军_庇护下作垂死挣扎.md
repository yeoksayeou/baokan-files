Xinhua News Agency, August 29th, Elisabethville dispatch: The vanguard of the Congolese government troops, who are suppressing the Katanga Tshombe separatist clique, a running dog of imperialism, reached Lutota, twenty miles north of Katanga Province, on the 28th, and continued southward towards Katanga Province. According to Agence France-Presse, the Congolese government army outposts had engaged in battle with the traitor Tshombe's troops, commanded by Belgian officers, at the border between Katanga and Kasai provinces.

It was previously reported that while advancing towards Katanga, this Congolese government punitive force sent a detachment of about 300 men to capture Bakwanga, the center of the other separatist clique supported by imperialism, the Kalonji group in southwestern Kasai Province, on the morning of the 27th. Reports indicate that the Congolese government army's just actions have been embraced and supported by the people along the way.

According to reports, the traitor Tshombe clique is making a desperate struggle, destroying all road and rail bridges from Kasai Province to Katanga Province on the 28th in an attempt to stop the government army's advance, while hastily gathering followers in an attempt to put up a stubborn resistance.

At the same time, Belgian colonialists and "UN forces" are colluding with each other to protect the Tshombe separatist clique. According to reports, Ghesan, the commander of the Belgian colonial army in the Congo, requested the United Nations on the 28th to establish a "neutral zone" between Katanga Province and Kasai Province. According to Reuters, on the same day, the "UN forces" in Katanga had moved towards the border between Katanga and Kasai provinces and planned to station there. The "Katanga army," which rushed to the border a few days ago, will withdraw from this area.

Xinhua News Agency, August 29th, Stanleyville dispatch: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, at a mass rally attended by more than two thousand people in Stanleyville on the 28th, called on people to join the Congolese government army to suppress the Tshombe separatist clique in Katanga Province, and expressed his determination to liberate Katanga Province by force.

Lumumba told the assembled masses that, in order to achieve the above-mentioned goal, he also intended to recruit a new force of eight thousand men from the African soldiers dismissed by the Belgian colonial authorities in Ruanda-Urundi.

According to reports, when Lumumba called on people to march on Katanga, the assembled masses cheered him enthusiastically.

Lumumba arrived in Stanleyville by plane from Leopoldville on the 27th. According to reports, Lumumba asked the crowd welcoming him at Stanleyville Airport: "Are you ready to oppose Katanga (the Tshombe group)?" People raised their hands to show their willingness and shouted "Freedom."

    据报道，当卢蒙巴号召人们向加丹加进军时，到会群众向他热烈欢呼。
    卢蒙巴是27日乘飞机从利奥波德维尔到达斯坦利维尔的。消息说，卢蒙巴曾在斯坦利维尔机场向欢迎他的人群问道：“你们准备去反对加丹加（的冲伯集团）吗？”人们都举手表示愿意，并且高呼“自由”。
