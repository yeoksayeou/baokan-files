    Strengthen Planning and Dispatching to Improve Loading and Unloading
    The conditions of vehicles, ships, and cargo in ports are constantly changing. A person engaged in grassroots loading and unloading dispatching work in a port must accurately and promptly grasp the changes on site and appropriately organize and allocate labor and mechanical equipment to ensure the completion of loading and unloading tasks. This year, the Party Committee called on us to earnestly change our leadership style and improve our leadership work level. I have been exploring and improving loading and unloading command work every day, and finally found a set of "one touch, two calculations, three inspections" working methods. Before going to work every day, I learn about the number of vehicles, ships, and goods in the work area from the general dispatcher, and then go to key sites to check their distribution. Based on the on-site situation, I carefully calculate how much labor and mechanical equipment is needed and check the loading and unloading schedule. Vehicle and ship dispatchers go down to understand how each vehicle and ship is completing the loading and unloading plan, the speed of progress, etc., while I focus on understanding the loading and unloading situation in depth. Dispatchers report three times a day, and based on the new situation of vehicles, ships, and goods on site and the work progress reported, we re-allocate labor and mechanical equipment. In this way, our work becomes much more proactive. Now we can promptly and accurately grasp the changes in the on-site situation, flexibly adjust the original daily schedule, and place labor and machinery in the most suitable places.

    加强计划调度做好装卸工作
    港口的车、船和货物情况总是千变万化的，一个做港口基层装卸调度工作的人，一定要准确及时地掌握现场的变化，确当地组织、调配劳动力和机械设备，才能保证装卸任务的完成。今年，党委号召我们切切实实改变领导作风，提高领导工作水平，我就天天摸索改进装卸指挥工作，终于找到了一套“一摸二算三检查”的工作方法。每天上班前，我就从总调度那里了解作业区车、船、货的数量，再到重点场地查看它们的分布情况。根据现场情况，仔细计算需要多少劳动力和机械设备，核对装卸进度计划。车船调度员都下去具体了解各个车船怎样完成装卸计划，进度快慢，等等，我自己则抓个重点，深入了解装卸情况。调度员一天汇报三次，我们根据汇报中现场车、船、货的新情况和工作进度，重新搭配劳动力和机械设备。这样一来，我们的工作就主动多了。现在我们已能够及时准确地掌握现场情况的变化，灵活地调整原来的日进度计划，把劳动力和机械放在最合适的地方。
