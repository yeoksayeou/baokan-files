Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Telegram: Hunan Province, in the intense "Double Rush" battle, has adopted methods such as strengthening leadership, developing cooperation, and vigorously promoting new tools, so that many areas with late seasons, heavy tasks, and relatively backward work can seize the season and complete their tasks.

After the widespread launch of rushing to harvest early rice and rush planting late rice, it was found that the progress between regions was very uneven. The slower progress in some areas, in addition to a few mountainous areas with later seasons or relatively backward work, was mostly due to the larger harvesting and planting tasks. In order to seize the season and successfully complete the "Double Rush" task, all localities have vigorously strengthened leadership over the "Double Rush" backward areas and given full play to the superiority of the People's Communes, vigorously developing support and cooperation under the principle of equivalent exchange. According to statistics from Shaoyang, Changde, and Xiangtan Special Districts, a total of more than 310,000 laborers were organized to support backward communes and teams. The support teams in various places implemented the "five determinations" method of determining time, location, task, quality, and remuneration, and launched labor competitions with the members of the backward communes and teams, encouraging each other and accelerating the progress of harvesting and planting. In Ningxiang County, eighty-two backward brigades had 170,000 mu of early rice to be harvested and 190,000 mu of late rice to be planted. By August 1st, only 26,000 mu of early rice had been harvested and more than 10,000 mu of late rice had been planted. At this time, the county organized 30,000 support laborers and squeezed out 9,308 laborers from their own teams and groups to participate in the "Double Rush," increasing the "Double Rush" labor force in these eighty-two brigades from the original 51,521 to 90,829. Twenty-six brigades also adjusted water usage to solve irrigation problems for thirty-one drought-affected brigades, saving 9,900 anti-drought labor days. By the 4th, these backward brigades had harvested 70% of the early rice and planted 51% of the late rice.

Various localities have also further strengthened labor organization and earnestly promoted new tools to accelerate the harvesting and planting speed. According to incomplete statistics, the province used a total of 180,000 fast rice harvesters, 76,000 threshing machines, and 110,000 rice transplanters.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning Telegram: Guangxi is helping backward areas rush to plant late rice through urban support and cooperation between communes and teams.

Areas across the province that have completed the "Double Rush" work are managing their late rice fields while also organizing forces to go to backward areas to support rush harvesting and planting. In Mengshan County, thirty-nine brigades and more than five hundred production teams have been linked to each other, cooperating based on the principle of equivalent exchange. The number of people supporting backward teams in rush harvesting and planting every day reaches more than 5,000, dispatching more than 4,700 pieces of large and small farm tools such as harvesters, plows, and rice transplanters, and more than 300 head of cattle.

Under the slogan of "taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link," the organs, enterprises, schools, factories, and mines in various towns and cities continue to transfer manpower and materials to the countryside to support backward areas in rush harvesting and planting. In Guixian County, 3,200 cadres and 18,400 laborers from various towns, carrying cattle and farm tools, adopted the method of contracting areas, tasks, quality, and time, greatly accelerating the county's harvesting and planting speed.

With the support of all parties, the backward areas have been greatly encouraged, setting off a competitive movement to catch up with each other.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Telegram: Cadres, workers, staff, students, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in Guangdong Province have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, setting off an unprecedented upsurge of supporting rush planting and expanding the planting of late rice. Within two or three days, the province formed a support team of 970,000 people, who went to the countryside and joined the rush planting activities. The speed of late rice transplanting in various places has been greatly accelerated.

The large-scale support for rush planting and expansion of planting by all walks of life is a concrete manifestation of the idea of "taking agriculture as the foundation" deeply rooted in people's hearts. After the Provincial Party Committee issued a call to support rush planting and expansion of planting at the telephone conference on the evening of the 2nd, from the province and special districts to the county-level organs, two-thirds to three-quarters of the cadres were transferred to the countryside to participate in the late rice rush planting activities.

    加强领导　开展协作　抢住季节　完成任务
    湖南广西先进帮后进抢插晚稻
    广东干部职工师生官兵积极参加抢插工作
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省在紧张的“双抢”战斗中，采取加强领导，开展协作，大力推广新工具等办法，使许多季节迟、任务重、工作比较后进的地区能抢住季节，完成任务。
    抢收早稻、抢插晚稻普遍开展以后，各地发现地区之间的进度很不平衡。进度慢的地区除了少数山区季节较迟，或者工作比较后进以外，多数是因为收插任务较大。为了抢住季节，胜利完成“双抢”任务，各地大力加强了对“双抢”后进地区的领导，并充分发挥人民公社优越性，在等价交换的原则下，大力开展支援协作。据邵阳、常德、湘潭三个专区统计，共组织了三十一万多劳力支援后进社、队。各地支援队伍实行定时间、定地点、定任务、定质量、定报酬的“五定”办法，和后进社、队的社员开展劳动竞赛，互相鼓舞，加快收插进度。宁乡县八十二个后进大队，应收早稻十七万亩，应插晚稻十九万亩，到8月1日只收了早稻二万六千亩，插了晚稻一万多亩。这时，全县组织了三万个支援劳力，并从本队、本组挤出九千三百零八个劳力参加“双抢”，使这八十二个大队“双抢”劳力由原来的五万一千五百二十一人增加到九万零八百二十九人；并由二十六个大队调整用水，给三十一个受旱大队解决水利问题，节省了九千九百个抗旱劳动日，到4日止，这些后进大队已收割早稻70％，插晚稻51％。
    各地还进一步加强劳动组织，认真推广新式工具，加快收、插速度。据不完全统计，全省共使用了十八万部快速割禾器、七万六千部打稻机和十一万部插秧机。
    据新华社南宁电　广西各地通过城市支援和社社队队协作，帮助后进地区抢插晚稻。
    全省已完成“双抢”工作的地区，在管理好晚稻田的同时，都纷纷组织力量，奔赴后进地区支援抢收抢种。蒙山县有三十九个大队、五百多个生产队，已经互相挂钩，根据等价交换的原则进行协作。每天支援后进队抢收抢种的人数达五千多人，出动收割器、犁耙、插秧机等大小农具四千七百多件，耕牛三百多头。
    各城镇的机关、企业、学校、厂矿，在“以农业为基础，以粮为纲”的口号下，继续抽调人力、物力下乡支援后进地区抢收抢种。贵县各城镇三千二百名干部、一万八千四百个劳动力，携带耕牛和农具，采取包地区、包任务、包质量、包时间的办法，使全县收种速度大大加快。
    后进地区在各方支援下，受到很大鼓舞，掀起你追我赶的竞赛运动。
    据新华社广州电　广东省广大干部、职工、学校师生和人民解放军官兵，热烈响应省委号召，掀起了一次规模空前的支援抢插扩种晚稻的热潮。全省在两、三天内，就组成了一支九十七万人的支援队伍，分赴农村，投入抢插活动。各地的晚稻插秧速度大大加快。
    各行各业大规模支援抢插扩种的行动，是“以农业为基础”的思想深入人心的具体表现。当省委在2日晚上的电话会议发出支援抢插扩种号召后，从省、专区到县级机关，都抽调了二分之一至三分之二的干部下乡参加晚稻抢插活动。
