    **Anshan Iron and Steel Organizes Circular Transportation**
    On the basis of realizing direct transportation "dragon network", the employees of the Transportation Department of Anshan Iron and Steel continued to carry out a transportation organization revolution, further developing the direct transportation "dragon network" into circular transportation of lines, operations, and vehicles. This reduced vehicle counter-flow empty transport and transfer dwell time, accelerated vehicle turnover, and achieved uninterrupted wheels and no stockpiling of goods, turning non-production time into production time. More than a month of trial results proved that the transportation efficiency in areas where circular transportation was implemented increased by an average of one to two times compared to the past.

    **Converter Continuously Blows Seventy-Eight Heats**
    All employees of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company actively carried out a converter "high-age longevity" campaign. The No. 4 converter in the first workshop of this plant, after creating a high-age longevity record of sixty-six heats on July 12, recently surged to continuously blowing seventy-eight heats, creating the highest converter furnace age record in the province.

    **Grinding Machine Manufacturing Strives for Perfection**
    Zhong Longkui, a technician from the hydraulic design group of the Design Department of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, together with processing and assembly workers, recently carried out the fifth revolution on the heart of the precision grinder—the hydraulic transmission control box. This further saved one-third of the materials compared to before, reduced processing man-hours by half, and further improved performance.

    **Daye Steel Plant Establishes Quality Supervision Network**
    Daye Steel Plant carried out mass quality inspection activities. From raw materials entering the plant to finished products leaving the plant, mass quality supervisors were established at every process, combining mass quality inspection with professional inspection to form a plant-wide quality supervision network, ensuring the continuous improvement of the qualification rate of open-hearth steel, electric furnace steel, forgings, and rolled materials.

    **Actively Tap Labor Potential**
    Coal mines and iron plants in Wanxian Prefecture, Sichuan Province, actively tapped labor potential from within enterprises to strengthen ore and coal production. They adopted the methods of "one high" (carrying out a high-efficiency movement of one worker doing the work of several), "two matching" (organizing cadres to work in coordinated teams, departments working jointly), "three merging" (merging unnecessary institutions), "four replacements" (replacing the weak with the strong, replacing men with women), and "five reforms" (carrying out large-scale technical innovation and tool reform). They have tapped five thousand laborers from within enterprises, which both strengthened the front line and ensured the leap forward in other aspects of work.

    **Transforming In-Mine Transportation**
    Employees of the Sifangshan Iron Mine in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, used simple and crude methods to reform ore crushing and loading equipment. On the twenty-five-kilometer-long in-mine transportation line, they installed three sets of indigenous (non-powered) continuous ore crushing and loading lines in three months, basically realizing the mechanization of ore crushing, transporting, and loading. This improved loading efficiency by more than nineteen times, reduced personnel by ninety percent, and fundamentally changed the phenomenon of vehicles being stuck at both ends due to slow loading and unloading in the past.

    **Grasping Daily Production Plans Firmly**
    Leading cadres of the Changchun Asbestos Plant went deep into the front line of production, adopting the "three guarantees" (guaranteeing the implementation of various Party committee resolutions, guaranteeing ideological education, guaranteeing the solution of key problems) and "three grasps" (participating in production in the morning to grasp key problems, grasping inspection at noon, grasping production preparation for the next day in the afternoon) methods to vigorously grasp the daily plan, achieving very good results. Now, the plant's daily production level has increased by 92.9 percent compared to the first quarter. In June and July, the national plan was completed comprehensively and evenly on a daily and ten-day basis, and August achieved a "good start."

    **Carry Out Direct "Dragon Train" Transportation**
    The Chongqing Office of the Chengdu Railway Bureau cooperated with production and sales departments in a Communist spirit, vigorously organizing direct "dragon train" transportation of key materials. This type of "dragon train" loads goods in full at the starting station, does not stop along the way, and directly reaches the destination station, greatly shortening the transportation time of coal, coke, and ore, and accelerating the turnover of locomotives and vehicles. In the past two months, the Chongqing Office has dispatched a total of 590 over-axle trains, with over-axle cargo totaling 239,700 tons, which is equivalent to dispatching an additional 130 trains without increasing the number of vehicles.

    要闻快报
    鞍钢组织环行运输
    鞍钢运输部职工在实现直达运输龙网化的基础上，继续进行运输组织大革命，使直达运输龙网化进一步发展成为线路、操作、车辆环行运输，减少了车辆对流空运和中转停留时间，加速车辆周转，做到车不停轮、货不积压，把非生产时间变成生产时间。一个多月的试行结果证明，凡是实行环行运输的地区，运输效率平均都比过去提高一倍到两倍左右。
    转炉连续吹炼七十八炉
    马鞍山钢铁公司炼钢一厂全体职工，积极开展转炉高龄长寿运动。这个厂第一车间四号转炉，继7月12日创造六十六炉高龄长寿纪录后，最近又猛增到连续吹炼七十八炉，创造了全省转炉炉龄最高纪录。
    磨床制造精益求精
    上海机床厂设计科压液设计组技术员钟龙奎和加工、装配工人一起，最近又对精密磨床的心脏部分——压液传动操纵箱进行了第五次革命，使材料比以前再节约三分之一，加工工时又减少一半，性能进一步提高。
    大冶钢厂设质量监督网
    大冶钢厂开展群众性的质量检查活动，从原材料进厂，到成品出厂，道道工序设立群众质量监督员，使群众性的质量检查和专业检查相结合，形成了全厂质量监督网，保证了平炉钢、电炉钢、锻材、轧材的合格率不断提高。
    积极挖掘劳动潜力
    四川省万县专区各煤矿、铁厂，积极从企业内部挖掘劳动潜力，加强矿石、煤炭生产。他们采取“一高”（在职工中开展一顶几的高工效运动）、“二配”（组织干部配套，部门联合办公）、“三并”（合并不必要的机构）、“四换”（以弱换强、以女换男）、“五改”（大搞技术革新、改革工具）的办法，已从企业内部挖掘了五千个劳动力，既加强了第一线，又保证了其他方面工作的跃进。
    改造矿内运输
    吉林通化市四方山铁矿职工，因陋就简地改革捣矿、装车设备，在二十五公里长的矿内运输线上，三个月装成三条土法（无动力）捣矿、装车连续线，基本上实现了捣矿、运矿、装车机械化，提高装车效率十九倍以上，人员减少百分之九十，并从根本上改变了过去装车卸车迟缓所造成的车辆窝在两头的现象。
    狠抓日生产计划
    长春石绵厂领导干部深入生产第一线，采取“三包”（包党委各项决议的贯彻执行，包思想教育，包解决关键问题）、“三抓”（上午参加生产抓关键问题，中午抓检查，下午抓第二天的生产准备）的办法，大抓日计划，取得了很好的效果。现在，全厂日产水平比第一季度提高百分之九十二点九。六、七两个月按日按旬均衡地、全面地完成了国家计划，八月份又实现了开门红。
