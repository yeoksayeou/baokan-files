Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Electric Dispatch: Workers at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company have launched an offensive centered on equipment maintenance, promoting continuous leaps forward in production. Statistics from July 15th to 24th show that compared to the ten days before the campaign, steel increased by 14.6%, pig iron increased by 10%, and steel材 (steel products) increased by 15%. There have also been significant increases in metallurgical coke, refractory bricks, and other products.

The offensive centered on equipment maintenance is an important measure for this company to ensure the realization of a great leap in production. To this end, the company's Party Committee Secretary personally took charge and formed an Equipment Maintenance Offensive Command, leading the workers of each factory to first launch a great airing of views, great contending, and great debate aimed at strengthening equipment maintenance. Within a few days, workers posted more than 500 big-character posters related to equipment maintenance, exposing 224 equipment defects and hidden dangers.

Subsequently, based on the problems and opinions raised by the workers, the leadership identified thirteen key issues affecting current production and concentrated superior forces to resolve them. The Rolling Mill organized workers to conduct a major equipment inspection, cleaning, and lubrication campaign, completely eliminating major production equipment accidents and driving production straight up. Thin plate production increased by 85.5% within ten days, and slab production surged by 173%. The Steelmaking Plant workers identified thirty-three major equipment problems, half of which have been resolved so far, leading to an all-round improvement in various indicators. Compared to the ten days before the campaign, steel production increased by 52%, smelting time was reduced by nearly one and a half minutes, and the steel合格率 (acceptance rate) increased by 3.1%. The Ironmaking Plant organized an equipment maintenance team to go deep into the blast furnaces, visiting them to solve equipment issues; in just one week, they solved sixty-two production equipment problems, effectively ensuring a steady rise in production. Pig iron production increased by 5.6% in the middle ten days of the month compared to the first ten days, and in the first five days of the last ten days, it surged by 19% compared to the period from the 1st to the 20th.

    太钢加强设备维修
    新华社太原电　太原钢铁公司职工以设备维修为中心展开了攻关战，促使生产持续跃进。据7月15日到24日的统计，同运动前十天比较，钢增长了14.6％，生铁增长了10％，钢材增长了15％。其他冶金焦、耐火砖等也都有很大的增长。
    以设备维修为中心的攻关战，是这个公司保证实现生产大飞跃的一项重要措施。为此，公司党委书记亲自挂帅，组成了设备维修攻关指挥部，领导各厂职工针对加强设备维护保养问题首先开展了大鸣大放大辩论。几天之内，职工们贴出有关设备维修方面的大字报五百多张，揭发出设备缺陷和隐患等问题二百二十四项。
    随后，领导上根据职工们提出的问题和意见，找出了影响当前生产的十三个关键，集中优势兵力进行解决。轧钢厂组织职工进行了设备大检查、大揩洗、大加油，彻底消灭了重大生产设备事故，推动产量直线上升，薄板产量十天之内增长了85.5％，板坯产量猛增了173％。炼钢厂职工检查出三十三个重大设备问题，到目前为止已经解决了一半，因而各项指标全面提高；与运动前十天比较，钢产量提高了52％，冶炼时间缩短了将近一分半钟，钢的合格率提高3.1％。炼铁厂组织了设备维修队，深入高炉，登门拜访，解决设备关键；短短一周，他们就解决了六十二个生产设备问题，有力地保证了生产的稳步上升。生铁产量中旬比上旬提高了5.6％，下旬头五天又比1日至20日猛增了19％。
