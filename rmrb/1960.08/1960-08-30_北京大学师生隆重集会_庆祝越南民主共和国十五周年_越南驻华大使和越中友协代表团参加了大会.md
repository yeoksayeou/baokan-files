Xinhua News Agency, August 29th. More than a thousand teachers, students, and staff members of Peking University held a grand meeting tonight to warmly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Tran Tu Binh, Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, other diplomatic officials, and all members of the delegation of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association led by Tran Huy Lieu, as well as Vietnamese students studying at Peking University and students from other countries, attended the celebration.

Lu Ping, Secretary of the Peking University Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and President of Peking University, spoke at the meeting. He congratulated the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the great achievements it had made in various construction undertakings over the past fifteen years, and praised the profound friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people. He praised the Vietnamese students for their hardworking and simple style and their studious spirit. He concluded by saying that, with the strong support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people and countries, any foreign conspiracy to split Vietnam will not succeed, and the beautiful land of Vietnam from Lang Son to Ca Mau will eventually be unified.

Tran Huy Lieu, head of the delegation of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, spoke to warm applause. He talked about the great achievements made by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in industrial and agricultural construction and cultural and educational undertakings since its founding. He said that the happier the Vietnamese people and Vietnamese youth and students live in the new life of socialism, the more angry and hateful they are towards U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. He said that the people of South Vietnam, with their revolutionary traditions, have never stopped fighting the enemy for six years, together with the people of the whole country. The U.S.-Ngo clique's conspiracy to split Vietnam's unification must fail, and Vietnam must be unified. Tran Huy Lieu concluded by saying: Vietnam and China are as close as brothers, and both are members of the socialist family headed by the great Soviet Union. Our unity and friendship are unbreakable.

Nguyen Thien Chi, a representative of the Vietnamese students, also spoke. He talked about the care of the Vietnamese Labor Party for young students and the friendship between Chinese and Vietnamese young students. A wonderful cultural program was performed at the meeting, including the "Ode to Ho Chi Minh" and "Communist Victory Song" sung by Chinese and Vietnamese students in chorus, as well as folk songs from Bac Ninh Province performed by Vietnamese students.
