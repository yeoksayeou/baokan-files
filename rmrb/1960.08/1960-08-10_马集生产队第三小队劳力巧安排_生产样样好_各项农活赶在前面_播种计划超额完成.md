    Ma Ji Production Team, Third Squad, Skillfully Arranges Labor Force: Production is Good in Every Way.
    All Agricultural Tasks are Ahead of Schedule; Sowing Plan is Completed Above Target.
    (Our report) How to complete the current arduous production tasks under the condition of tight labor force? This is a question of universal concern for comrades doing rural work. The Third Squad of the Ma Ji Production Team of the Xiaozhan Commune in Hexi District, Tianjin, is good at calculating the active role, fully estimating the subjective initiative of people, and mobilizing all positive factors. This squad is also good at skillfully arranging and rationally using the labor force, has made very good achievements in this regard, and has also accumulated some experience.
    This production squad has a total of 454 mu of land, mainly engaged in garden production. The gardens are mostly planted with fine vegetables, which requires more labor. This year, the garden area has not only expanded by 98 mu, but the replanting target has also increased. This squad has a total of 116 full and semi-laborers, and currently 81 people are directly involved in agricultural production (accounting for 70% of the total labor force). Each laborer has to bear an average of 5.6 mu of land, of which more than 3.5 mu is garden land. Under these circumstances, can production be done well? This has become the most urgent question to be answered by the Third Squad. In dealing with this problem, the cadres of the Third Squad did not only see the difficult side of having less labor and greater tasks, nor did they get stuck in the old calculation method of "how much land can one person cultivate". Instead, they believed that the masses were rich in initiative and creativity. Thanks to the mobilization of the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, the production tasks of this squad have always been completed excellently. All agricultural tasks are ahead of schedule. The autumn vegetable planting area of the whole squad has expanded to 284 mu, an increase of 15 mu over the original expansion plan. The rice planting area has expanded to 150 mu, exceeding the target by 12 mu. The sowing progress of autumn vegetables is also the fastest in the whole commune. As of August 2, more than 130 mu of vegetables had been planted, accounting for about 50% of the total task. In addition, they also extracted a part of the people to plant 13 mu of chives while rushing to plant cabbage. The field management of various crops is also very good, the seedlings are growing vigorously, and there are few weeds in the fields. This squad not only does an excellent job in production, but also arranges life very well.

            Good at Doing People's Work
    A very important reason why this squad can make such achievements is that it pays attention to mobilizing the labor enthusiasm of commune members and is good at doing people's work.
    Squad Leader Zhang Deqing said: "No matter what work you do, as long as the commune members understand its political significance, they will have more strength." Therefore, in their daily work, political and ideological work is very active. They not only promptly convey the Party's policies and the resolutions of the production team and commune member representative meetings to the commune members; but also pay close attention to the ideological activities of the commune members, and often use easy-to-understand principles to clarify the policies. At the same time, they also use the method of class analysis to study the ideological trends in the team, and thoroughly understand the temperament and character of each commune member. They carry out meticulous ideological work targeting different personalities, delivering ideological work to the door, and solving ideological problems by means of individual heart-to-heart talks. In this way, people are always in a good mood and full of energy.
    The leadership style of this squad is good, and they are good at uniting the masses. Squad Leader Zhang Deqing is a sincere, amiable person who consults with the masses in everything he encounters. Around the team's cadres there are also some activists who unite the commune members of the entire team. Everyone is of one mind and one heart, and the work is well promoted. As long as the squad leader says it, the commune members can do it. Another characteristic of the squad cadres is that they endure hardship first and set an example in everything. The cadres are also very considerate and caring about the commune members. The more the cadres care about the commune members, the more motivated the commune members are.

          Implementing the Policy of Distribution According to Work
    This squad pays great attention to implementing various policies and correctly handling the relationship between the brigade, the squad, and the commune members. In particular, they resolutely implement the policies of equal pay for equal work, work quotas for agricultural tasks, and distribution according to work. Therefore, the labor enthusiasm of commune members has been greatly stimulated. Squad cadres pay great attention to reasonably revising the work quotas for agricultural tasks. This spring, according to the degree of difficulty, ease, lightness, and heaviness of various agricultural tasks, they formulated the contract quota for various agricultural tasks, and let everyone discuss it, so that each commune member could understand the work point remuneration for each agricultural task. After the contract quota is formulated, it is revised in a timely manner when natural climate affects or production conditions change, so that the quota is more reasonable.
              Rational Use of Labor Force
    After doing a good job in political and ideological work and stimulating the enthusiasm and subjective initiative of commune members, it is also necessary to do a good job in labor management and use the labor force properly so that everyone can give full play to their role. In the words of Squad Leader Zhang Deqing: "The most basic key is to have a clear understanding – to know people, to know the work, and also to know the weather (season, climate)."
    What the squad leaders are good at is that they are not only familiar with production, but also have a very accurate understanding of the ideological situation, temperament, and physical strength of each commune member; Before assigning work, the cadres first consider: which group and which person is most suitable for this task and can "take it down." Therefore, the vast majority of commune members can complete their tasks on time, and they become more and more motivated.
    The entire squad is divided into eleven work groups. In addition to appropriately taking care of the rational allocation of backbone forces, the work groups are mainly divided according to the age and physical strength of the commune members. The scale of the groups is not large, six people in the male group and a few more in the female group. The advantage of this grouping is: it is convenient to implement the production responsibility system from top to bottom at all levels; the groups live in a concentrated area, which is convenient for meetings and labor; it is convenient to carry out "strong against strong" and "weak against weak" competitions, which is conducive to the enthusiasm of the commune members. Once each group is fixed, it remains unchanged throughout the year and is responsible for certain field operations. In the event of a surprise task, people are temporarily transferred from each work group, and after the surprise task is completed, they return to their original group. In this way, regular work and surprise tasks are better combined.
    It is very important to assign work in advance, so that the group or commune members can have a clear understanding and make production preparations early; it can avoid delaying labor time and make production orderly. They generally assign agricultural tasks that are not very seasonal or relatively simple to the work groups two or three days in advance; agricultural tasks that are highly seasonal and have a high degree of suddenness are assigned at the latest the day before. Recently, in the rush to plant autumn vegetables, the work is tight and there is a lot of rain, which has a great impact on production. The team formulated two sets of work assignment plans for the two possibilities of "no rain" and "rainy". On August 2, the squad leader originally assigned five groups to rush to plant carrots and scallion seedlings, and assigned another two groups to weed the autumn scallion field. Because it was estimated in advance that it might rain, two sets of arrangements were made accordingly. Therefore, when it rained, the commune members participating in weeding immediately transferred to the autumn vegetable planting front, accelerating the autumn vegetable sowing progress and also avoiding wasting work time.
    Garden production is highly technical, and many processes are closely linked. Each link must be closely connected and not relaxed. This squad pays great attention to this issue. They arrange every period of agricultural work in great detail, doing this stage and planning the next stage. In specific processes, according to the different needs of adjacent processes and labor use, a one-stop labor distribution is implemented. For example, when rushing to plant autumn vegetables, the adjacent processes of weeding, fertilizing, land preparation, and sowing are matched with a certain proportion of labor. The work is very compact. There is no situation where the land preparation is waiting for fertilization, or the sowing is waiting for the land preparation. There is no wasting time in the middle, and the progress is fast and the quality is good.

    马集生产队第三小队劳力巧安排　生产样样好
    各项农活赶在前面　播种计划超额完成
    本报讯　在劳动力紧张的情况下，怎样完成当前繁重的生产任务？这是做农村工作的同志普遍关心的问题。天津市河西区小站公社马集生产队第三小队因为善于算活账，充分估计到人的主观能动作用，调动了一切积极因素。这个小队还善于把劳动力巧加安排、合理使用，在这方面做出了很好的成绩，也积累了一些经验。
    这个生产小队共有土地四百五十四亩，以园田生产为主。园田里种植的又多是细菜，这就需要更多的劳动力。而今年，园田面积不仅扩大了九十八亩，复种指标也有增加。这个小队共有整半劳力一百一十六人，目前直接投入农业生产的有八十一人（占总劳动力的70％），每个劳动力平均要负担五亩六分地，其中园田就占三亩半以上。在这种情况下，能不能把生产搞好？成了三小队当前最需要解答的课题。对待这个问题，三小队的干部没有只看到劳力少、任务大的困难一面，也没有在“一个人能种多少地”的老算法里钻牛角尖，而是相信群众富有能动作用和创造性。由于调动了广大社员的积极性，这个小队的生产任务一直完成得很出色，各项农活都赶在前边，全小队秋菜扩大到二百八十四亩，比原扩种计划增加了十五亩；水稻扩种到一百五十亩，超额十二亩；秋菜播种进度也是全公社最快的，到8月2日，已经种菜一百三十多亩，占总任务的50％左右。此外，他们还抽出一部分人在抢种白菜的同时，栽上了十三亩韭菜。各种作物的田间管理也很好，幼苗生长茁壮，田里杂草很少。这个小队不仅生产搞得出色，生活也安排得很好。
            善于做人的工作
    这个小队能够作出这样的成绩，一个很主要的原因是，注意调动社员劳动积极性，善于做人的工作。
    小队长张德庆说：“无论做什么工作，只要让社员明白了它的政治意义，才会更有力量。”因此，他们在日常工作中，政治思想工作很活跃，不但及时向社员传达党的方针政策和生产队、社员代表大会的决议；而且还非常注意社员的思想活动，经常用通俗易懂的道理讲清方针政策。同时，他们也用阶级分析的方法来研究队里的思想动态，并且摸透每个社员的脾气秉性，针对不同性格进行细致的思想工作，把思想工作送上门，用个别谈心的办法解决思想问题。这样，人们始终心情舒畅，干劲十足。
    这个小队的领导作风好，善于团结群众。小队长张德庆就是一个心意诚恳，和蔼可亲，遇事找群众商量的人。在队的干部周围还有一些积极分子团结着全队的社员，上下一条心，一股劲，工作很好推动，只要队长说到了，社员就能做到。小队干部另一个特点是吃苦在先，事事以身作则，干部对社员也十分体贴关心。干部越关心社员，社员干劲越足。
          执行按劳分配政策
    这个小队很注意贯彻执行各项政策，正确地处理大队、小队和社员之间的三者关系。特别是坚决贯彻同工同酬，农活定额，按劳分配等政策。因此大大激发了社员的劳动积极性。小队干部很注意合理修定农活定额。今年春天，他们根据各种农活难、易、轻、重等程度，制定了各种农活的包工定额，让大家讨论，使每个社员都弄清各项农活的工分报酬。包工定额制定后，遇到自然气候影响或生产条件变化及时修改，使定额更加合理。
              合理使用劳动力
    做好政治思想工作，激发社员的积极性和主观能动性之后，还必须搞好劳动管理，把劳动力使用得当，使每个人都能充分发挥作用。照小队长张德庆的话说：“我们最基本的关键是心中有数——要对人有数，对活有数，还要对天（季节、气候）有数。”
    这个小队领导拿手的是，不但对生产熟悉，而且对每个社员的思想情况，脾气秉性，体力强弱都摸的很准；干部在派工前首先考虑到：这一桩活那个组、那个人最合适，能“拿得下来”。因而绝大部分社员都能按时完成任务，而且越干劲越足。
    全小队划分十一个作业小组。作业组除了适当照顾骨干力量的合理配置以外，主要根据社员的年龄和体力强弱划分。小组的规模不大，男组六人，女组多一点。这样编组的好处是：便于由上到下层层实行生产责任制；小组居住集中，开会、劳动方便；便于开展“强对强”、“弱对弱”之间的对手赛，有利于社员积极性的发挥。每个小组一经固定，常年不变，负责一定的田间作业，遇到突击任务，临时从各作业小组调人，突击任务完成后仍回原组。这样就把经常性的工作和突击性的任务更好地结合起来了。
    提前派工很重要，可以使小组或社员做到心中有数，提早作好生产准备；可以不耽误劳动时间，使生产进行的有条有理。他们对季节性不太强也比较单纯的农活，一般提前两三天派到作业组；季节性强，突击性大的农活，最晚也在前一天分派出去。最近在突击抢种秋菜中，活紧雨天又多，对生产影响很大。这个队就针对“无雨”和“有雨”两个可能，安排了两套派工计划。8月2日这天，队长本来分派了五个小组抢种胡萝卜和葱秧子，另外分派了两个小组到秋葱地里除草。因为事先估计到可能下雨，相应地做了两套安排。所以在下雨的时候，参加除草的社员立即转移到了抢种秋菜阵地，加快了秋菜播种进度，也避免了窝工。
    园田生产技术性很强，很多工序紧密相连，必须一环扣一环，环环不放松。这个小队很注意这个问题。他们对每一个时期的农活都安排的特别细，干着这一段，计划下一段。在具体工序上，根据相连工序的不同需要和用工情况，实行劳力支配一条龙。例如，在抢种秋菜的时候，除草、施肥、整地、播种几个相连工序都配搭一定比例的劳力，干起活来很紧凑，没有出现整地的等施肥的，播种的等整地的，中间不窝工，并且进度快，质量好。
