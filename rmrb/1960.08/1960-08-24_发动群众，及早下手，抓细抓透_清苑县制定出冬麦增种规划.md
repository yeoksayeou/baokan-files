Mobilize the Masses, Start Early, Grasp the Details Thoroughly
Qingyuan County Formulates Winter Wheat Planting Plan

(Reported by this newspaper) Hebei's Qingyuan County, while carrying out autumn field management, started early and comprehensively unfolded wheat planting preparations, and achieved significant results. In order to absorb this year's increased production experience, the Qingyuan County Party Committee, as early as the wheat yellow ripening period, held an on-site meeting in the high-yield plot of Shitou Village, Shenxing Commune, to summarize the high-yield experience and arrange next year's planting plan. Subsequently, the Party Committees of each commune also convened cadres, members' representatives, and experienced farmers from each team in the high-yield plots of their respective communes for on-site visits, discussions, summaries, and arrangements. Through mass visits, summaries, presenting facts, and comparisons, the vast majority of cadres and masses in the county unanimously recognized that the key to winning even greater wheat harvests next year is that, in terms of methods, they must start early, grasp the details thoroughly, and ensure that all seeds planted become first-class wheat. Specialized teams were also generally established to conscientiously implement the "three guarantees and one reward" system. In terms of technology, it is necessary to fully implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, especially to guarantee the five major aspects of irrigation during drought, sufficient base fertilizer, deep plowing of land, close planting in small ridges, and improved seeds on the basis of large square gardenization. Accordingly, the County Party Committee, in the spirit of promoting quality with early action, based on the summary of experience, mobilized the masses from top to bottom and from bottom to top to formulate the wheat planting plan in mid-June. It was also determined that Lu Xinchun, Secretary of the Secretariat of the County Party Committee, and Liu Shijie, Secretary and County Chief, would be specially responsible for the wheat planting work. Each commune and team also assigned a secretary to be specifically in charge of wheat planting, forming a strong front from top to bottom.

Currently, while doing a good job in autumn field management, in addition to the ongoing shock campaign for wheat field water conservancy construction and the repair of irrigation and drainage machinery, the county has mobilized more than 70,000 people to carry out a major shock campaign to accumulate and transport fertilizer.

    发动群众，及早下手，抓细抓透
    清苑县制定出冬麦增种规划
    本报讯　河北清苑县在进行秋田管理的同时，及早动手，全面展开了种麦准备，并获得了显著成绩。为了吸取今年的增产经验，中共清苑县委早在小麦黄熟时期，就在神星公社市头村小麦丰产方召开了总结丰产经验和安排明年种植计划的现场会议，随后各公社党委也都召集各队干部、社员代表和老农在本社的丰产方进行了现场参观、座谈、总结和安排。通过群众性的参观、总结、摆事实、搞对比，全县广大干部和群众一致认识到，夺取明年小麦更大收成的关键，在方法上必须早下手，抓细、抓透，一种全成一类麦。并普遍建立专业队，认真执行“三包一奖”。在技术上必须全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”，尤其要在大方园田化的基础上，保证旱能浇，底肥足，土地深翻，小垅密植，优种化五大关。据此，该县县委本着以早促好的精神，在总结经验的基础上，于6月中旬就发动群众自上而下，自下而上的制订了种麦规划。并确定县委书记处书记芦新春，书记兼县长刘士杰专抓种麦工作。各社队也都确定了一名书记专管种麦，从上到下组成了一条坚强的战线。
    当前，在搞好秋田管理的同时，除正突击麦田水利建设、整修排灌机械外，全县出动七万多人开展积肥运肥大突击。
