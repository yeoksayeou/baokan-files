	Transfer

	Qiao Yuan

	It is extremely important for cadres to go deep into the front lines of production, settle down in a production team or a square of farmland, work steadily and practically, participate in labor, and set an example.

	It's not enough just to stay put; it's also necessary to move around. A county party secretary told me that he had labored diligently in a fixed location for two days, then rode his bicycle and traveled across the three communes he was responsible for, covering one hundred and sixty *li* in a day, inspecting and promoting overall production. It can be seen that staying put and moving around are both indispensable.

	Every cadre who goes deep into the front lines of production should also have their own area of responsibility. Because they are cadres, they are different from the masses. In addition to working with the masses as ordinary laborers at a fixed location, they must also take care of the overall situation and lead the overall work, not just be ordinary laborers. Of course, the area of responsibility can be large or small: it can be a production team, several production teams, several management areas, or even several communes… To take care of the overall situation, one must move around. If one only stays put and neglects the overall situation, then one has not fulfilled the mission of leading production.

	Moving around, however, must be based on staying put. One cannot just move around like a "dragonfly skimming the water," without settling down. If the fixed location is not well managed and experiences are not summarized, how can one guide the overall work well? One must first manage the fixed location well, work steadily and practically, and gain a deep understanding of the current production reality from working, and find a way out. In this way, before moving around, one can have a clear understanding, consider what key problems need to be solved during this tour, and how to solve them? Come up with relatively mature solutions. Then, move around in a planned and purposeful way. Otherwise, with "a thousand roads leading out the door," one can go anywhere, but only "encounter setbacks," which loses the meaning of moving around and fails to strengthen the leadership of the overall work. Since the content is empty and ethereal, it will inevitably devolve into formalism. In the process of moving around, one will often encounter situations where one needs to use practical work to guide work, and one must take the lead in doing so. One cannot think, "I am just here to move around." Moving around is not an end in itself; the purpose is to lead. One must stop while moving, and move on after stopping. It’s not just "a fleeting glance," but also "planting flowers after dismounting."

	The overall situation is organized from the fixed locations. Moving around will inevitably involve contact with various different locations. In addition to using the experience gained from the fixed location to guide other locations, one must also fully value each location's own experience and learn from them. Moving around is not only a process of guiding work, but also a process of learning. Do not think that the experience gained from your own fixed location is all good and can be used to guide the general situation, and that other places cannot produce any good experience. There will definitely be more good experiences in large areas. Using the fixed location to guide the overall situation, one must also use the overall situation to enrich the fixed location. Enriching the fixed location is more conducive to guiding the overall situation. In this way, circulating back and forth, promoting each other, improving day by day, and greatly enlivening the situation. Only by adopting an attitude of both guiding and learning can one both go everywhere to give gifts and return home with joy, making the fixed location better and the overall situation better.

	When mentioning "transfer," some people understand it as walking around, looking around casually, and strolling through the fields. Of course, this is also a kind of transfer. However, in the practice of leading production, the method of transfer is very different. Transfer is part of the leadership method, and it must be achieved through arduous work. In the process of moving around, one must quickly grasp the problems and quickly and practically solve them; one must quickly gather the situation and quickly put forward calls and firmly persist in them; one must see both the particularity and the universality of things, so as to realize the combination of the individual and the general in leadership, and build the work on a comprehensive understanding and in-depth study of things. This kind of transfer is going to the front lines of production to command the battle, which is of course not related to "strolling" type transfer.

    干部深入生产第一线，落脚蹲点于一个生产小队、一块方田，踏踏实实地干，参加劳动，做出样子，这是极其重要的。
    光蹲点还不行，还要转面。一位县委书记对我说过，他曾蹲在点中扎扎实实地劳动了两天，又骑上了自行车，走遍他所包片的三个公社，一天转了一百六十里，检查和推动了全面生产。可以见得，蹲点和转面，缺一不可。
    每个深入生产第一线的干部，也都应该有自己的面。因为是干部，与群众不同，除了在点上与群众同劳动，作一个普通劳动者以外，还要照顾到面，把全面工作领导起来，不仅仅作一个普通劳动者。当然，面有大小，可以是一个生产小队，可以是几个生产队，几个管理区，也可以是几个公社……要照顾到面，就要去转面。如果只蹲点，把面丢了，那也就没有完成领导生产的使命。
    转面又要有蹲点作基础。不能光是转，像“点水蜻蜓”，落脚不住。点没有蹲好，经验没有总结出来，如何能够去指导好全面工作？必须先把点蹲好，踏踏实实地干，从干中求得对当前生产实际有个深刻的了解，找出路子。这样，在转面以前，才能心中有数，根据点的情况，考虑到这次转面要解决什么关键问题？如何解决？拿出比较成熟的办法来。然后，有计划、有目的地去转。不然，“出门千条路”，哪里都可以去，光“吃碰头食”，也就失去了转面的意义，不能加强对全面工作的领导，内容既然虚无飘渺，必然流于形式主义。在转面当中，会经常遇到要用干来指导工作的场合，也就要带头干。不能认为，我只是来转面的。转面本身不是目的，目的是要领导。转中有站，站过就转，不止是“走马看花”，还要“下马栽花。”
    面是由点组织起来的。转面，必然要接触到各个不同的点。除了用所蹲点的经验去指导其它点以外，还必须充分重视每个点的自己的经验，必须向它们学习。转面，不仅是一个指导工作的过程，也是一个学习的过程。不要以为自己所蹲点的经验都是好的，可以用来指导一般，而别的地方出不了什么好经验。在大面积的点上一定会有更多的好经验。用点来指导面，又必须用面来丰富点。点丰富了，更有利于对面的指导。如此循环往复，互相促进，日新月异，大为生色。只有抱着一面指导、一面学习的态度，才能既去到处送礼，又喜满载而归，把点搞得更好，也把面搞得更好。
    一提到转，有人会理解为到处走走，随意看看，漫步田头。当然，这也是一种转法。可是，在领导生产的实践中，转法却大有不同。转是领导方法组成的一部分，是要经过艰巨的工作来实现的。在转面当中，要迅速地抓住问题，又迅速地切实地解决问题；要迅速地把情况集中起来，又要迅速地提出号召，切实地坚持下去；要既看到事物的特殊性，又看到事物的普遍性，从而实现个别同一般相结合的领导，把工作建立在对事物的全面了解和深入研究的基础上。这样的转法，是亲临生产第一线去指挥战斗，同“漫步”式的转法，当然是扯不到一起去的。
