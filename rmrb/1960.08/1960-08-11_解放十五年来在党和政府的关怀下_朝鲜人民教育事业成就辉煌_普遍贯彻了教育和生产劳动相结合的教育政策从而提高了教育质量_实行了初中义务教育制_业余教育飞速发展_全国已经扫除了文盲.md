    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th. In the fifteen years since the liberation of Korea, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government have vigorously developed the people's education, achieving brilliant successes. Today, northern Korea has implemented a junior middle school compulsory education system; compared with 1944 before liberation, the number of students has increased 2.8 times, and the number of schools has increased 5.7 times. Northern Korea, which did not have a single university before liberation, now has thirty-seven universities.
    Before liberation, there were 2.3 million illiterates in northern Korea, and only 35% of school-age children could attend school. Only 1.8% of primary school graduates could enter junior middle school. Children of workers and peasants could not attend middle school at all. At that time, Korea had very few of its own technical personnel. The Xingnan Fertilizer Factory, which employed tens of thousands of workers, had only four or five Koreans among its technical personnel before liberation.
    After liberation, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government attached great importance to the development of education. Even during the arduous period of the war against American aggression, they persisted in running schools in caves and air-raid shelters. After the war, the state allocated large amounts of funds to build schools. A large part of the first batch of buildings constructed after the war were school buildings. In 1957 and 1958, Korea also launched a mass movement to build school buildings. Agricultural cooperatives, factories, and government offices all helped to build school buildings. In these two years, an average of five to six thousand classrooms were built each year.
    Over the past fifteen years, Korea has also trained a large number of teachers. In particular, since 1956, a primary compulsory education system has been implemented. In 1958, a junior middle school compulsory education system was implemented, followed by a free education system. At present, there are more than 7,800 schools of all levels in northern Korea, with more than 2.47 million students.
    In developing education, Korea has implemented the Labor Party's educational policy of combining education with productive labor. Students at all levels participate in appropriate labor. Some streets, squares, and parks in Pyongyang were built by university students. Students of the Pyongyang Construction Specialized School designed and constructed a three-story Dongcheng Middle School building last year; this year they are building a printing factory. The Heecheon Mechanical Specialized School produced more than 600 water pumps for the countryside last year. Now many colleges and universities can produce machine tools.
    Recently, many schools have also been engaged in scientific inventions and creations. Students of the Shipbuilding Department of Kim Chaek University of Technology have designed and manufactured a shallow-water machine barge suitable for navigating in Korean rivers. The Seongcheon Agricultural Machinery School has also successfully tested the use of Korean anthracite coal, which has large reserves, to replace imported gasoline as fuel for tractors. To date, colleges and universities have completed more than 250 inventions and creations. The implementation of the educational policy of combining education with productive labor has not only strengthened students' thinking and physical strength, but also strengthened the connection between theory and practice in education, thereby improving the quality of education.
    Currently, Korea is actively preparing for the full implementation of a technical compulsory education system starting in 1962. New types of technical schools, where general courses and technical courses each account for half, will be developed to 800 by the beginning of the new school year in September this year. This further implements the educational policy of combining education with productive labor.
    In the fifteen years since liberation, 3.2 million students have graduated from schools at all levels in Korea, and 100,000 specialized personnel have been trained. In the industrial city of Xingnan alone, there are 2,360 technical personnel trained by Korea itself.
    Amateur education in Korea has also developed rapidly. Illiteracy has been eliminated throughout the country, and now one million working people are studying culture and production technology in amateur adult schools and technical schools. (Attached picture)

    解放十五年来在党和政府的关怀下
    朝鲜人民教育事业成就辉煌
    普遍贯彻了教育和生产劳动相结合的教育政策从而提高了教育质量
    实行了初中义务教育制　业余教育飞速发展　全国已经扫除了文盲
    新华社平壤10日电　朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府在朝鲜解放后十五年来，大力发展人民教育事业，取得了辉煌的成就。今天，朝鲜北部已经实行了初中义务教育制；同解放前1944年相比，学生人数增加到二点八倍，学校数增加到五点七倍。解放前连一所大学也没有的朝鲜北部，今天有了三十七所大学。
    解放前，朝鲜北部有二百三十万文盲，学龄儿童能上学的只占35％，小学毕业后能够升入初中的只占1.8％。工农子弟根本上不了中学。当时朝鲜很少有自己的技术人材，上万名工人的兴南肥料工厂，在解放前技术人员中只有四、五名是朝鲜人。
    解放后，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府十分重视发展教育事业，就是在反对美国侵略的战争的艰苦时期，也在山洞、防空洞中坚持办教育；战后，国家更拨出大量资金兴建学校，战后兴建的第一批建筑物中很大一部分是校舍。在1957年和1958年，朝鲜还开展了兴建校舍的群众运动，农业社、工厂、机关都帮助建设校舍，这两年平均每年都兴建教室五、六千间。
    十五年来，朝鲜还培养了大批师资。特别是自1956年起就实行了初等义务教育制，1958年又实行了初中义务教育制，并紧接着实行了免费教育制。目前朝鲜北部共有各级学校七千八百多所，在校学生二百四十七万多名。
    朝鲜在发展教育事业中，贯彻了劳动党教育和生产劳动相结合的教育政策。各级学校的学生都参加适当的劳动。平壤市的一些街道、广场、公园就是各大学的学生们建设的。平壤建设专门学校的学生，去年自己设计、施工建成了一座三层的东城中学校舍；他们今年又建设一座印刷厂。熙川机械专门学校去年为农村生产了六百多台抽水机。现在许多大专学校都能生产机床。
    近来许多学校还在搞科学发明创造。金策工业大学制船系的学生，自己设计制成了一种适合在朝鲜江河中航行的浅水机器驳船。成川农业机械学校还试验成功用朝鲜蕴藏量很大的无烟煤代替进口的汽油，作为拖拉机的燃料。到最近为止，各大专学校搞成发明创造有二百五十多项。实行教育和生产劳动相结合的教育政策，不仅锻炼了学生的思想和体力，而且加强了教育中的理论和实际的联系，从而提高了教育质量。
    目前朝鲜正为从1962年开始全面实行技术义务教育制积极进行准备。一般课程和技术课程各占一半的新型技术学校，到今年9月新学年开始时，将发展到八百所。这样就进一步贯彻了教育和生产劳动相结合的教育政策。
    解放后十五年来，朝鲜从各级学校中毕业的学生已达三百二十万人，并培养出了十万名专门人材。仅在工业城市兴南一地，就有朝鲜自己培养出的技术人员二千三百六十名。
    朝鲜的业余教育也有飞跃的发展。全国已经扫除了文盲，现在有一百万劳动人民在业余成人学校和技术学校中学习文化和生产技术。（附图片）
