Red Pine Base
—What I Saw and Heard in the Lesser Khingan Mountains	Our Correspondent Li Jicheng
In these years of the Great Leap Forward, people have seen that our cities have become more beautiful, our countryside has become more beautiful, and our factories and mines have become more beautiful. But what exactly has changed in the forest area?

This time we went to the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area for a month's visit and saw the tremendous changes in the forest area. Like other parts of the country, after the establishment of people's communes, it has become more beautiful and lovely. In the past, people's impression of the silent mountains and forests was only the lush red pine and the beautiful sea of forests. Now, this green ocean, coupled with the scattered factory clusters, has brought culture and technology to the forest area, and the quiet mountains and forests have become lively.

	Beautiful Forest Area Life
Lilin Forest Farm is an ordinary forest farm in the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area. It is a forest farm (equivalent to a management area) of the Dafeng People's Commune in Yichun City, the forest capital. When we came to visit, we saw from afar a new forest area village composed of rows of red brick and gray tiled houses, built among the surrounding mountains on the banks of the Wolong River. This new village is like thousands of new villages in the Lesser Khingan Mountains, developed with the great development of forestry production, especially after the establishment of forest area people's communes and the vigorous development of diversified management and comprehensive utilization. It has changed from a single timber production base to a joint enterprise that not only fells timber but also plants trees, engages in comprehensive timber utilization, grows vegetables and raises pigs, and engages in diversified management. In the past, the lives of forestry workers were mobile. After the timber on this mountain was felled, they would go to that valley. The workers in this new village of Lilin Forest Farm moved four times from 1953 to 1956, but now they have settled down.

Here, there are rows of brick and tile structured staff and family dormitories. Next to the staff and family dormitories is the Lilin Forest Farm office. Around it are the tractor repair and assembly plant, the processing plant for small-sized timber, and various forest chemical plants for tannin extract, rosin, pine root oil, etc., all built after the establishment of people's communes. The people's commune has also promoted the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. The forest farm has established farms, chicken farms, and pig farms at the foot of the mountain. When we visited here, the vegetables in the fields were not yet ripe, but the cucumbers, leeks, garlic sprouts, etc. in the farm's greenhouse were already supplied to the public canteen.

Here, we also saw groups of logging workers riding bicycles to the logging site to work. At the hottest time of noon, workers from the new village's ice fruit factory delivered ice fruits to the logging site and the processing plant, so that the logging workers in the deep mountains and dense forests could also eat ice fruits like those in the city. At night, the forest village boiled, and the power station on the Wolong River sent out electric current, and the whole village was brightly lit. After work, the workers went to night school in pairs to study culture and theory, and the barber began to receive customers for perms. At this time, the forest village radio station broadcasted the day's labor achievements and beautiful songs to the people. ...

	Tractors Have Become an All-Purpose Treasure
"The east wind blows, the red flag flutters, the mountains and trees rejoice together, the innovation and opening up bloom in thousands of flowers, and the tractor becomes an all-purpose treasure."

This is a hymn written by forestry workers in the Lesser Khingan Mountains for a tractor that can simultaneously perform eight tasks such as harvesting, branching, processing, and loading.

In the past, tractors in forest areas could only be used for timber collection. Workers saw that such a large machine only did one job, which was a bit of a waste of talent. They wondered if the tractor could do several jobs at the same time. The workers of the Northwest River Forest Farm of the Tieli Forestry Bureau found a way. They removed the crawler plates from the tractor, fixed it, and installed a large drum on the drive wheel. They used aerial cableways for timber collection and loading, and used the tractor's power to install power generation equipment, and drove electric saws for harvesting and branching through cables. At present, this "multi-purpose" comprehensive use of tractors has not only been promoted in various forest areas throughout the province, but also extended to afforestation, silviculture, and forest area infrastructure construction.

	More Trees Are Planted Than Cut Down
In people's impression, forest areas are cutting down trees every day, and some people may worry: will the forests be cut down one day? No, in our forest areas, there is not only a group of workers felling trees, but also a group of workers specializing in planting trees. In fact, more trees are planted than cut down.

Originally, the trees in the forest area grew naturally and very slowly. A red pine needs a hundred years to be used, and even poplar trees, which grow very quickly, need about thirty years to grow. In the past, forest areas relied on natural regeneration. In this way, the coniferous forest cutting area could only be re-harvested after a hundred years, and the broad-leaved forest cutting area would take thirty to fifty years. In order to make forest renewal keep up with harvesting, forestry workers have adopted artificial afforestation methods. They clear the broken wood and weeds from the cut forest land, and plant seeds or seedlings in pieces. In this way, the trees planted artificially grow faster and better than those that grow naturally. The Daixing Forestry Bureau of the Lesser Khingan Mountains planted more than 14,000 mu of trees artificially on the cut land in 1953, which has now become a forest, reaching 40 cm in height and 2 cm in thickness at the roots. According to the current growth situation, it can be harvested in fifty years, shortening the growth time of natural forests by half.

In this way, the forest can be operated sustainably.

	Factories Are Everywhere in the Forest Area
A guest from Beijing praised the Lesser Khingan Mountains as "clusters of factories, patches of forest farms, cattle and sheep all over the mountains, and sparks of steel everywhere." In the Lesser Khingan Mountains, whether it is a forestry town or a new forestry village, whether it is a logging site on the mountain or a timber processing plant at the foot of the mountain, there are timber comprehensive utilization factories and forest chemical plants run by the families of forestry workers everywhere. The rosin factory of the Yidong Forestry Bureau that we visited was run by several high school graduates. Only four months have passed, and these young people have produced dozens of tons of good rosin like amber for the country.

In March of this year, several young men and women, members of the Communist Youth League, Huang Yuchang, Zhao Lanxiang, and Lu Shoulian, knew that the country needed rosin, so they wanted to set up a rosin factory. But where to find a factory building and where to find equipment? These things did not stump them. They spent a day and a night to clean up the dilapidated house of less than 50 meters, set up a large iron pot for cooking, and started refining rosin. Things are often not as simple as people imagine. The first batch of rosin refined was black and looked like a plaster. Rosin should be yellow! What is the reason for this? The Party branch led them to repeatedly study and realized that this was due to the unclean pine resin and the rust on the iron pot. To improve the quality of pine resin, it is necessary to filter it with a copper sieve, but they did not have a copper sieve. Huang Yuchang took his own luggage cloth to experiment with filtering the impurities in the pine resin, and the effect was very good. They also changed the large iron pot to a copper pot and an aluminum pot, and refined rosin of very good quality. They also changed manual feeding to semi-mechanized feeding, reducing the daily feeding time from three hours in the past to ten minutes, and the daily output jumped from 50 kilograms to 600 kilograms and 900 kilograms. This rosin factory completed half of its annual production plan at the end of May.

    红松基地
    ——小兴安岭林区见闻	本报记者　李继承
    这几年的大跃进，人们都看到我们的城市更美丽了，我们的农村更美丽了，我们的工厂和矿山更美丽了。可是，到底林区发生了什么变化呢？
    这次我们到小兴安岭林区，作了一个月的访问，看到了林区的巨大变化，它也和全国各地一样，大办人民公社以后，变得更加美丽，更加可爱了。过去，人们印象里沉寂的山林，如今到处办起了工厂，响起了机器的马达声；过去，人们向往的兴安岭，只是那苍郁的红松，美丽的林海，如今，这绿色的海洋，加上那星罗棋布的工厂群，给林区带来了文化，带来了技术，寂静的山林沸腾起来了。
        美丽的林区生活
    丽林林场是小兴安岭林区一个普通的林场，它是林都伊春市大丰人民公社的一个林场（相当于管理区）。我们来访问的时候，老远就看见在卧龙河畔，一栋栋红砖灰瓦房构成的林区新村，建立在群山环抱之中。这个新村是和小兴安岭千百个新村一样，随着林业生产大发展，特别是大办林区人民公社后，大搞多种经营、综合利用以后发展起来的。这里已由过去的单一木材生产，变成了既伐木头又种树，既搞木材综合利用，又种菜养猪，进行多种经营的联合企业。过去林业工人的生活是流动的，这个山头的木头伐完了，就到那个山谷去。丽林林场这个新村的工人，1953年到1956年就搬了四次家，现在他们已经定居下来了。
    在这里，有一排排砖瓦结构的职工家属宿舍，职工家属宿舍的旁边，是丽林林场的办公室，在它的周围，是大办人民公社以后建起的拖拉机修配厂，加工小规格木材的加工厂，栲胶、松香、松根油等各种林化工厂。人民公社还促进了农林牧副渔全面发展，林场在山脚下，办了农场、鸡场和猪场。我们访问这里的时候，田间蔬菜还未成熟，但农场温室里的黄瓜、韭菜、蒜苗等，已经供应公共食堂了。
    在这里，我们还看到，成群的伐木工人骑着自行车到伐木场去上班。到了炎热的中午，新村冰果厂的工人，把冰果送到伐木场和加工厂，让在深山密林里的伐木工人，也吃到了像城市里一样的冰果。到夜晚，林村沸腾了，卧龙河上的发电站，送出了电流，全村灯火通明。下了班的工人，双双走进夜校，学习文化和理论，理发师开始接待烫发顾客。这时，林村广播站向人们广播一天的劳动成果和优美的歌曲。……
          拖拉机变成了万能宝
    “东风吹来红旗飘，群山万木齐欢笑，革新开放万朵花，拖拉机变成万能宝。”
    这是小兴安岭的林业工人，为一台拖拉机同时能干采伐、打枝、造材、装车等八样活而写的一首赞歌。
    过去林区的拖拉机只能作集材用，工人们看到这样的大家伙，只干一样活，真是有点大材小用，他们就琢磨，能不能让拖拉机同时干几样活呢？铁力林业局西北河林场的职工，找到了一条门路。他们把拖拉机脱下了履带板，固定下来，在起动轮上安上个大卷筒。通过架空索道，进行集材装车，用拖拉机的动力，安装上发电设备，通过电缆线带动电锯采伐、打枝。目前，这种“一机多用”的综合使用拖拉机的方法，不仅在全省各个林区推广了，还把它推广到造林、营林和林区基本建设方面去了。
        栽的树木比砍的多
    在人们的印象里，林区每天都在砍木头，也许有人会耽心：会不会有一天把森林砍光了呢？不会的。在我们林区里，不但有一批工人伐木，还有一批工人专门管栽树，实际上栽的比砍的还多。
    本来，林区里的树都是天然生长起来的，长得很慢，一棵红松需要一百年才能使用，就是生长得很快的杨树，也需要三十年左右的时间才能长成。过去林区都是靠天然更新的，这样，针叶树的伐区，要一百年后才能再行采伐，阔叶树伐区也得三、五十年。林业工人们为了使林木更新跟上采伐，就采取了人工造林的办法，他们在采伐过的森林迹地上，把碎木乱草清理出去，一片片种上树籽，或栽上幼苗，这样用人工栽的树比天然生长的树长得又快又好。小兴安岭带岭林业局，1953年在采伐迹地上用人工栽的一万四千多亩树，现已成林，高达四十厘米，根部有两厘米粗。按现在的成长情况来看，五十年后即可成材采伐，比天然森林生长的时间缩短一半。
    这样，森林就可以永续作业了。
        林区到处是工厂
    一位从北京来林区的客人，赞扬小兴安岭是“工厂成群，林场成片，牛羊满山，钢花四溅”，在小兴安岭，不管是林业城镇，还是林业新村，不论是山上的伐木场，还是山下的木材加工厂，到处都有林业职工家属办的木材综合利用工厂和林化工厂。我们访问的伊东林业局松香厂，就是几个高小毕业生办起来的，时间仅仅过去了四个月，这几个小青年就为国家生产了几十吨像琥珀般的好松香。
    今年3月，共青团员黄玉常、赵兰香、芦守莲几个年轻小伙子和姑娘们，知道国家需要松香，他们就要办个松香厂，可是到哪里找厂房，又到哪里找设备呢？这些事并没有难住他们。他们花一昼夜的时间，把不到五十米的破旧屋子，修理干净，架设了煮饭的大铁锅，炼起松香来了。事情往往不是人们想像的那样简单，第一次炼出来的松香黑呼呼的像块膏药。松香应该是黄色的呀！ 这是什么原因呢？党支部就领导他们反复研究，知道这是由于松脂不洁和铁锅有锈。要提高松脂的质量，需要用铜箩过滤，可是他们没有铜箩，黄玉常就把自己的包袱皮，拿来试验过滤松脂的杂质，效果很好，又把大铁锅改成铜锅和铝锅，炼出了质量很好的松香。他们又把手工上料改成半机械化上料，使每天上料时间，由过去的三小时，缩短到十分钟，日产量由五十公斤一跃为六百公斤、九百公斤。这个松香厂，在5月末就完成了全年生产计划的一半。
