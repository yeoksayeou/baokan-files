(Reported by this newspaper from Shanghai on the 16th) The mass production competition movement on Shanghai's steel front is developing in a broader and more in-depth direction. The quantity and quality of steel continue to rise. In the first half of August, compared to the same period in July, the city's steel production increased by more than 12%; the qualification rate and first-class rate of converter steel also increased significantly.

This year, Shanghai's steelmaking production tasks have seen greater increases than last year, and quality requirements are also higher. Since April, after the city's converter steel eliminated third-grade products, the steel qualification rate has remained above 95%, and the first-class rate is as high as about 80%. Especially since July, leading cadres of various factories have gone deep into the production frontlines, grasping both political and ideological work and concrete measures, resulting in a good situation of increasing output every ten days and steadily improving quality.

Currently, in every steel plant, whether it is the area in front of the furnace, the material yard, or the transportation and furnace building, the atmosphere is filled with strong competition. The vast number of cadres and workers are full of confidence and high morale, and the spirit of communist collaboration has been greatly developed. Some workshop workers in the material yard of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, knowing that uniform material chunks are important to the quality of molten iron, expressed their determination to "work meticulously with coarse grains" to supply the smelting furnace with good materials. Many hot-blast furnace workers, willing to sweat more, resolutely adopted the method of frequent and small additions of materials and thin-layer slag removal to raise the hot air entering the smelting furnace from 300 degrees to about 400 degrees, enabling furnace front workers to use more satisfactory hot air to improve desulfurization. In order to thank other work types for their support, some furnace front workers presented their high-yield, high-quality red flags to the material yard workers with gongs and drums, and some saved their share of soda water to comfort comrades in the brick-making and furnace-building sections. When the material yard workers are busy loading materials, the furnace front workers often take the initiative to support them; seeing the workers sorting lime and dust flying, they immediately took sanitary masks and sent them over. This noble style of mutual care, mutual consideration, taking on difficulties, and yielding honors shown by the workers on the steel front makes the collaboration in all aspects of steelmaking production even closer. In July and August, thanks to the close cooperation of all sections such as material loading, material transportation, brick making, furnace building, and hot blast, many new technologies and new measures were fully utilized, so that the melting rate of large alkaline smelting furnaces in various factories generally increased from about ten tons to about twelve tons per hour, and the desulfurization effect in the furnace generally reached 70%; the highest in the No. 1 converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 reached more than 80%.

Carrying out large-scale experimental furnaces to address various key technical issues in production is an important part of the current mass movement on Shanghai's steel front. In various steel plants, there are various types of experimental furnaces. Whichever key technical issue has not been overcome, there is a corresponding experimental furnace; as soon as an experimental furnace gains experience, it is immediately summarized and seriously promoted. With the widespread development of the mass movement of carrying out large-scale experimental furnaces, more and more advanced models have emerged who consciously use and seriously promote new technologies. Air vents, furnace building, and tapping iron are very arduous and important tasks on smelting furnaces. In these positions, many experts have emerged in various steel plants. In Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 alone, more than 1,000 pacesetters of various types have been established since the beginning of this year. After the three furnaces in the No. 1 electric furnace workshop conducted a pacesetter furnace competition, they have created the highest record of electric furnace life of more than 600 heats. In the mass competition upsurge of establishing pacesetters and carrying out large-scale experimental furnaces, the No. 1 smelting furnace in the Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, transformed from the original "old ox" into a steed, becoming a red flag among large smelting furnaces. The equipment conditions of this furnace are not good, and the raw materials used and the technical measures taken are similar to those of other furnaces, but because all employees adhere to political command, everyone strives for progress, and the furnace chief and workers are "officers and soldiers united," and all aspects promote the spirit of communist collaboration, they created outstanding achievements at the end of July and the beginning of August: they used pig iron with an average sulfur content of more than 0.75% for smelting, the average melting rate reached 18.1 tons per hour, the desulfurization effect in the furnace reached 68.4%, and the furnace life was as high as 276 heats.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 16th. Leading cadres on Yunnan Province's industrial front have gone deep into the steel production frontlines during the rainy season, vigorously grasping the two key areas of mining and quality, and winning high-quality and high-yield results. The province comprehensively completed its steel, iron, and steel production plans in July. The daily steel output in July increased by 25% compared to June, and the average daily steel output in the first ten days of August increased by 9% compared to July, exceeding the state plan by 17%. The qualification rate of steel ingots has remained above 90% since July.

In order to turn the rainy season into a high-yield season for steel production, leading cadres from the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee's Industrial and Transportation Department, Economic Construction Committee, and Metallurgical Department have all gone deep into the key point of the province's steel industry – the Kunming Iron and Steel Company – to help the company study and solve problems in rainy season production and raw material supply. Leading cadres of steel enterprises throughout the province have also gone deep into the production frontlines.

During this period, the steel front in the province generally adopted the form of holding "production games" to organize the masses to conduct concentrated large-scale skill competitions, so that various technical innovations and advanced experiences could be widely exchanged and promoted, and the production level was comprehensively improved. Various converter steelmaking workshops also launched a "Hundred Furnaces Without Scrap Steel Movement" centered on vigorously improving quality. After launching the "Hundred Furnaces Without Scrap Steel Movement," Kunming No. 1 Steel Plant carried out three major technical transformations on the converter. The workers also meticulously operated, creating an excellent record of continuous 217 furnaces without defective products. In July, the qualification rate of converter steel in the entire plant reached 99.21%, and the iron consumption per ton of steel also decreased significantly.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, August 16th. Jiangxi Province's pig iron production is rising steadily. The output in the first ten days of August increased by 30% compared to the same period in July, and the average qualification rate of pig iron in the province reached more than 86% in July, and increased to more than 88% in the first ten days of August. The coke ratio and cost have also decreased. In order to ensure the comprehensive completion of steel production plans, more than 10,000 cadres throughout the province have gone deep into the furnace front, eating, living, laboring, and discussing with the workers, vigorously attacking the key to production, and promoting the continuous advancement of production. The Party Secretary and Director of Pingxiang Iron and Steel Plant and other leading cadres went deep into the furnace front to investigate and study, and found that coke and transportation could not keep up with the needs of blast furnace production. They personally led the masses to form transportation and rapid coke output fronts, and continuously organized high production to ensure the needs of the blast furnace. The average daily output of pig iron in the entire plant in late July increased by 16% compared to mid-July, and increased by 33% again in the first ten days of August compared to late July. All localities have also generally established a cadre leadership system, implementing responsibility for ideological mobilization, responsibility for completing tasks, and responsibility for safe production, which has also played a significant role in improving steel production.

In order to make steel production better leap forward, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, on the one hand, strengthened leadership over key steel enterprises, and at the same time, insisted on fully leveraging the potential of various special districts and counties to build small blast furnaces, small coal kilns, and small iron mines, under the premise of not competing with agriculture for labor and equipment, and fully supporting agriculture. A large number of small blast furnaces have been built throughout the province, and some have been put into production after supporting facilities have been added. All localities have also vigorously built earthen railways and simple roads to improve transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang. Since the beginning of August, steel production in Guizhou Province has further increased. In the first five days of August, steel and iron increased by 12% and 21% respectively compared to the same period last month, and raw coal, coke, and ore also saw significant increases.

Thousands of cadres throughout the province rushed to the steel production frontlines. The provincial industrial and commercial and infrastructure construction systems alone formed 70 inspection teams and went to key factories and mines in the province's special districts, prefectures, and cities to participate in production and lead production. Party committees at all levels of special districts, prefectures, cities, and factory and mining enterprises also organized capable cadres to go deep into the work teams accordingly. Cadres going deep into the frontlines greatly promoted steel production. In some small-scale steel enterprises in Shuicheng, Zunyi, and Qiannan, the qualification rate of pig iron reached 100%. The Lushan Iron Plant in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture mobilized the masses to besiege "sulfur damage," and the sulfur content of pig iron has been significantly reduced. Leaders at all levels of industrial departments in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture went deep into the mines, vigorously grasping the key to the production of ore and coke, ensuring that every blast furnace had 30 to 40 days of reserve.

    云南、江西、贵州领导干部深入第一线狠抓关键措施促进钢铁增产
    本报上海16日电　上海钢铁战线上的群众生产竞赛运动，正在向着更广泛更深入的方向发展。钢的产量、质量继续上升。8月上半月与7月同期相比全市钢产量增长12％以上；转炉钢的合格率和一级品率，也有较大增长。
    今年，上海的炼钢生产任务比去年有更大的增长，质量要求也更高。4月份起，全市转炉钢消灭了三级品之后，钢的合格率一直保持在95％以上，一级品率高达80％左右。特别是7月份以来，各厂领导干部深入生产第一线，既抓政治思想工作又抓具体措施，因而出现了产量一旬高一旬，质量稳步上升的大好形势。
    现在在各个钢铁厂里，无论是炉前、料场，还是运输、砌炉等各个岗位，到处都洋溢着强烈的竞赛气氛。广大干部和职工信心百倍，斗志昂扬，共产主义协作精神大大发扬。上钢一厂有些车间料场的工人，知道料块均匀对铁水质量好坏关系重大的道理后，表示坚决做到“粗粮细作”，以好料供应化铁炉。许多厂的热风炉工人，宁愿自己多流汗，坚决采取勤加、少加料和薄层多出渣的办法，把进化铁炉的热风从三百度提高到四百度左右，使炉前工人能够用比较满意的热风提高去硫效果。炉前工人为了感谢其他工种对自己的支援，有的把自己得到的高产、优质红旗敲锣打鼓地送给料场工人，有的把自己份内的汽水省下来送去慰问制砖、砌炉工段的同志。料场工人上料紧张时，炉前工人往往主动去支援加料；看到整理石灰的工人筛石灰尘粉飞扬，他们又立即领了卫生口罩送去。钢铁战线工人这种相互关心、相互体贴、见困难就上、见荣誉就让的高尚风格，使炼钢生产的各个环节协作得更为紧密。7、8月份，由于上料、运料、制砖、砌炉、热风等所有工段的密切配合，许多新技术、新措施得以充分发挥作用，使各厂大型碱性化铁炉熔化率普遍由十吨左右提高到十二吨左右，炉内去硫效果一般达到70％；上钢三厂一转炉车间最高达到80％以上。
    针对生产技术上的各种关键问题大搞试验炉，是当前上海钢铁战线群众运动的一项重要内容。在各钢铁厂里，有着各种各样的试验炉。哪一个技术关键未攻破，就有哪种试验炉；哪一个试验炉取得了经验，就立即加以总结，认真推广。随着大搞试验炉的群众运动的普遍发展，出现了越来越多的自觉运用和认真推广新技术的先进标兵。通风眼、砌炉子、打出铁口是化铁炉上很艰苦、很重要的工作。在这些岗位上，各个钢铁厂都出现了许多能手。单是上钢五厂，今年以来就树立了各种标兵一千多名。五厂一电炉车间三只炉子进行标兵炉竞赛以后，已经创造了电炉炉龄六百炉以上的最高纪录。在大树标兵、大搞试验炉的群众性竞赛热潮中，上钢三厂第二转炉车间的一号化铁炉，由原来的“老黄牛”变成了千里马，成为大型化铁炉中一面红旗。这只炉子设备条件并不好，使用的原材料、采取的技术措施也和别的炉子差不多，但是，由于全体职工坚持政治挂帅，人人发奋图强，炉长和工人“官兵一致”，各个环节大兴共产主义协作之风，在7月底8月初创造了突出的成就：他们使用平均含硫0.75％以上的生铁化铁，平均熔化率每小时达到十八点一吨，炉内去硫效果达到68.4％，炉龄高达二百七十六炉。
    本报昆明16日电　云南省工业战线的领导干部在雨季中深入钢铁生产第一线，狠抓矿山与质量两大关键，夺得优质高产。全省在7月份全面完成了钢、铁、钢材生产计划，7月份钢的日产量比6月份增长25％，8月上旬钢的平均日产量又比7月份提高9％，超过国家计划17％，钢锭合格率从7月份以来一直保持在90％以上。
    为了把雨季变成钢铁生产的高产季节，云南省委工业交通部、经济建设委员会和冶金厅的领导干部，都深入到全省钢铁工业的重点——昆明钢铁公司，帮助公司研究和解决雨季生产和原材料供应中的问题。全省钢铁企业的领导干部也都深入到生产第一线。
    在这期间，全省钢铁战线普遍采取了召开“生产运动会”的形式，组织群众集中进行大比武、大竞赛，使各项技术革新和先进经验得到广泛交流和推广，全面地提高了生产水平。各转炉炼钢车间还开展了以狠抓提高质量为中心的“百炉无废钢运动”。昆明第一钢铁厂在开展“百炉无废钢运动”以后，在转炉上进行了三大技术改造，工人在操作中也一丝不苟，创造了连续二百一十七炉无废品的优异成绩，7月份全厂转炉钢的合格率达到99.21％，每吨钢的铁耗也大大下降。
    本报南昌16日电　江西省生铁产量步步上升。8月上旬比7月份同期增长30％，生铁合格率7月份全省平均达到86％以上，8月上旬提高到88％以上。焦比、成本也有所降低。为了确保钢铁生产全面完成计划，全省一万多名干部都深入炉前，和职工同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，猛攻生产关键，推动生产不断前进。萍乡钢铁厂党委书记、厂长等领导干部深入炉前调查研究，发现焦炭、运输跟不上高炉生产的需要，便亲自带领群众组成运输、快速出焦两条战线，连续组织高产，保证了高炉的需要。全厂7月下旬生铁平均日产量较中旬增长16％，8月上旬又比7月下旬增长33％。各地还普遍建立了干部带班生产制度，实行包思想发动、包完成任务、包安全生产，这对提高钢铁生产，也起了很大作用。
    中共江西省委为了使钢铁生产更好地跃进，一方面加强对重点钢铁企业的领导，同时还坚持在不和农业争劳力争设备，全力支援农业的前提下，充分发挥各专、县的潜力，建设小高炉、小煤窑、小铁矿。全省已建成大批小高炉，并已有一部分经过配套投入生产。各地还大搞土铁路和简易公路，改善了运输。
    据新华社贵阳讯　贵州省钢铁生产进入8月以来有了进一步增长，8月头五天钢和铁分别比上月同期增长12％和21％，原煤、焦炭、矿石也有显著的增长。
    全省有成千的干部奔赴钢铁生产第一线。仅省属工商、基建系统，就组成七十个检查组，分赴全省专、州、市重点厂矿，参加生产，领导生产。各专、州、市及厂矿企业党委，也相应地组织了得力干部深入班组。干部深入第一线，大大促进了钢铁的生产。水城、遵义、黔南等地的钢铁小洋群，有的企业生铁的合格率达100％。黔东南苗族侗族自治州炉山铁厂，发动群众围攻“硫害”，生铁含硫量已显著降低。黔南布依族苗族自治州工业部门各级领导深入矿山，狠抓矿石、焦炭的生产关键，保证了座座高炉都有三、四十天的余粮。
