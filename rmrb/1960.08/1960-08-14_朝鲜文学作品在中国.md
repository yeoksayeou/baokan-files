    Korean Literary Works in China
    Tao Bingwei
    China and Korea are as closely related as lips and teeth. For thousands of years, our two countries have had close cultural exchanges and have influenced each other. However, in the last hundred years, due to the imperialist aggression and oppression of both countries, and the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in China, our people have had fewer opportunities to access Korean literary works and have rarely been able to read progressive Korean literary works. As for the KAPF literature (the Korean Proletarian Literary Artists League, established in 1928), which played a foundational role in modern Korean revolutionary literature, we know even less.
    After the people of both countries were successively liberated, progressive Korean literary works began to be introduced to China. After the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea began, the relationship between the people of the two countries entered a new stage, becoming intimate and inseparable. A large number of Korean literary works also appeared before Chinese readers.
    From Korean classical masterpieces such as "The Tale of Chunhyang" and "The Tale of Shim Chong" and works such as "Korean Folk Tales," Chinese readers learned about the darkness and corruption of Korean feudal society and the people's struggle against the ruling class. From Han Xueye's novels "The Tower" and "Dusk," Li Qiyong's novel "Hometown," and "Selected Poems of Park Pal-yang," they learned about the struggles of Korean workers, farmers, and intellectuals against Japanese imperialism after the Japanese imperialist occupation of Korea. From Han Xueye's novel "History" and the children's novel "Mangyongdae," from Zhao Qitian's epic poem "Mount Paektu," and Han Mingquan's epic poem "North Gando," they learned how the Korean people, under the leadership of Premier Kim Il-sung, carried out armed anti-Japanese struggle.
    Regarding the scene of the Korean people becoming masters of their own affairs and building a new life after liberation, we gained a relatively deep understanding from Li Qiyong's novel "Land" and Zhao Qitian's epic poem "Song of Life." Regarding works reflecting the Korean people's resistance to U.S. imperialist aggression, Zhao Qitian, Kim Sang-oh, and others' collection of poems "Korea is Fighting," Park Jin-suk and others' children's novel "Korean Young Guerrillas," Kim Sa-ryang's reportage collection "Comrades, the Sea is in Sight," Huang Jian's short story "Burning Island," Han Xueye's novella "The Wolf" and novel "Daedong River," Min Bingjun's epic poem "Song of Korea," Li Wenyou's children's novel "The Day of Hope," Li Qiyong's novella "Riverside Village," Qian Shifeng's novella "Fighting Villagers," Li Zhongchun and Cui Jian's play "We Can't Live Like That Anymore," Han Cheng's play "Wait for Us," the screenplay "Guerrilla Girl," and Kim Hak-yeon's children's epic poem "Young Guerrilla Xu Qianglian," all have Chinese translations published.
    For a long time, praising the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people has been an important theme of Korean literature. Park Se-young and others' collection of poems "Song of Comrades-in-Arms," Zhao Lingchu's play "Comrades-in-Arms," Li Zhenhua's children's novel "Korean Children and Volunteer Army Uncle's Horse," Yoon Dong-hyang and others' collection of poems "Along the Yalu River," and other works enthusiastically praised the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people forged in blood. Park Se-young and others' collection of poems "Phoenix," Kim Hyung's play "Fishing Boat Forward," Kang Hyo-soon's collection of children's stories "Never Again Like That," Kim Buk-hyang's short story "Grandpa and Son," Li Jiaji's short story "Construction Site Night Talk," Li Xiaoyun's poem "Chollima Knights," and other works reflect the soaring enthusiasm of the Korean people in engaging in socialist economic construction after the war. In addition, Kwon Jung-yong's novel "Father's Accusation," the children's novel "Thorn Bush," Zheng Wenxiang's poem "We Stay Awake All Night," Choi Young-hwa's poem "Your Days Are Over," Li Qiyong's political essay "Let Us Gather Together," exposed the tragic situation in South Korea under the rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dog Syngman Rhee, and depicted the heroic struggle of the South Korean people to overthrow the reactionary rule, as well as the Korean people's urgent desire for peaceful reunification of the motherland.
    To celebrate the 15th anniversary of the "August 15th" Korean Liberation, People's Literature Publishing House and Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House have recently published representative works of KAPF writers and contemporary young writers, "Selected Modern Korean Short Stories," Huang Jian's novel "Gaema Plateau" depicting the struggle of Korean rural youth during the war, and "Collection of Korean Dramas," which includes many excellent plays. They will help us to know our close brotherly country more and more deeply.

    朝鲜文学作品在中国
    陶冰蔚
    中国和朝鲜唇齿相依，千百年来，我们两国的文化有过密切的交流，而且互为影响。但是，近百年来，由于帝国主义对两个国家的侵略和压迫，中国由于国民党反动派的黑暗统治，我国人民接触朝鲜文学作品的机会较少，很少能够阅读到朝鲜的进步文学作品。至于在朝鲜现代革命文学中起了奠基作用的卡普（1928年成立的朝鲜无产阶级文学艺术同盟）文学，我们知道得就更少了。
    两国人民相继获得解放后，朝鲜的进步文学作品，开始介绍到中国来。伟大的抗美援朝运动展开以后，两国人民的关系进入到一个新阶段，亲密无间，血肉相连，朝鲜文学作品也大量涌现在中国读者面前。
    中国读者从《春香传》和《沈清传》等朝鲜古典名著和《朝鲜民间故事集》等作品中，了解到朝鲜封建社会的黑暗和腐朽，以及人民反抗统治阶级的斗争情况；从韩雪野的长篇小说《塔》、《黄昏》和李箕永的长篇小说《故乡》，以及《朴八阳诗选》等作品中，了解到日本帝国主义侵占朝鲜以后，朝鲜工人、农民和知识分子对日本帝国主义所进行的斗争；从韩雪野的长篇小说《历史》和儿童小说《万景台》中，从赵基天的长诗《白头山》，韩鸣泉的长诗《北间岛》中，了解到朝鲜人民如何在金日成首相领导下进行抗日武装斗争。
    关于朝鲜人民解放后当家做主建设新生活的情景，我们从李箕永的长篇小说《土地》和赵基天的长诗《生之歌》等作品里，得到比较深刻的了解。关于反映朝鲜人民反抗美帝国主义侵略的作品，赵基天、金常午等的诗集《朝鲜在战斗》，朴金淑等的儿童小说《朝鲜少年游击队》，金史良的通讯报告文学集《同志们，看见海了》，黄健的短篇小说《燃烧的海岛》，韩雪野的中篇小说《狼》和长篇小说《大同江》，闵丙均的长诗《朝鲜的歌》，李园友的儿童小说《盼望的一天》，李箕永的中篇小说《江岸村》，千世峰的中篇小说《战斗的村民》，李钟淳、崔健的剧本《不能再过那种日子》，韩成的剧本《等着我们吧》，电影文学剧本《游击队的姑娘》，金鹤渊的儿童长诗《少年游击队徐强廉》等，中国都有译本出版。
    长时期以来，歌颂中朝人民友谊，一直是朝鲜文学的重要主题之一。朴世永等的诗集《战友之歌》，赵灵出的剧本《战友》，李镇华的儿童小说《朝鲜孩子和志愿军叔叔的马》，尹东乡等的诗集《鸭绿江边》等作品，热烈地歌颂了中朝人民用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊。朴世永等的诗集《不死鸟》，金衡的剧本《渔轮前进号》，姜孝顺的儿童小说集《再也不那样了》，金北乡的短篇《爷儿俩》，李甲基的短篇《工地夜话》，李晓云的诗《千里马骑士们》等等作品，反映了战后朝鲜人民从事社会主义经济建设的冲天干劲。此外，权正龙的小说《父亲的控诉》，儿童小说《荆棘丛》，郑文乡的诗《我们通宵不眠》，崔英华的诗《你们的日子已到头》，李箕永的政论《让我们聚首一堂》，揭露了在美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚统治下的南朝鲜的悲惨景象，并描写了南朝鲜人民为推翻反动统治而进行的英勇斗争，以及朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的迫切愿望。
    为了庆祝“八·一五”朝鲜解放十五周年，人民文学出版社和上海文艺出版社最近又出版了卡普作家和当代青年作家的代表作《朝鲜现代短篇小说集》，黄健描写战争期间朝鲜农村青年斗争的长篇小说《盖马高原》，以及包括许多优秀剧本在内的《朝鲜戏剧集》等。它们将会帮助我们更多、更深地了解我们的亲密的兄弟之邦。
