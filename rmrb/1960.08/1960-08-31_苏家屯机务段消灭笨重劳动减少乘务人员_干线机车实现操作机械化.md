Sujiatun Locomotive Depot Eliminates Heavy Labor, Reduces Crew
Achieves Mechanized Operation of Trunk Line Locomotives

    (Our report) All long-distance locomotives at the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot of the Shenyang Railway Bureau have achieved mechanized and semi-automated operation. Heavy manual operations such as coal shoveling, fire stoking, grate shaking, and ash blowing have been eliminated on the locomotives. The fireman who used to shovel coal is no longer needed, reducing the crew on each locomotive from three to two people, and changing the shift system from three shifts to four shifts, thoroughly changing the working conditions of the crew, increasing study and rest time, and improving locomotive utilization efficiency by 4%-6% compared to the past.

    The mechanization and semi-automation of locomotive operation is an outstanding creation of Chinese railway workers in the technical revolution movement. Since the advent of railways, trunk line steam locomotives have been operated by three people. In February of this year, Cui Xiufan, a train driver from the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot and a representative at the National Congress of Heroes, under the inspiration of the Party Committee and with the assistance of technical personnel, transformed the first mechanized and semi-automated locomotive. After being appraised by the leadership and deemed suitable for widespread promotion, the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot began to comprehensively promote this advanced technology from the end of May, and began to transform the locomotives.

    During the mechanized and semi-automated transformation of locomotives, the Party Committee Secretary took personal command, leading cadres went deep into the workshops and were on the scene, following the shifts day and night, giving on-the-spot directions, eating and working with the workers, offering suggestions, and finally, in thirty days of hard work, converted all sixty-three locomotives to automatic coal feeding.

    After the technical transformation of the locomotives, the most arduous manual labor on the locomotive—fire stoking—was completely mechanized and semi-automated. In the past, when the locomotive was running, the assistant driver and the fireman took turns standing at the smoke-filled and fiery boiler opening, shoveling coal into the boiler one shovelful at a time, averaging more than two tons per hour. Now, the assistant driver sits on a chair and can automatically add coal by turning the gate valve. This has changed the crew system of steam engines since their existence, eliminating the need for a fireman and implementing an eight-person, four-shift system.

    The crew is changed from three to two people per shift, and each locomotive is changed from a three-shift system to a four-shift system, giving the crew sufficient rest time to ensure safe driving. For example, in the past, the round trip from Sujiatun to Siping took twelve hours of work, and the crew only had twenty-four hours of rest. Now they can rest for thirty-six hours. After this is fully implemented, the entire depot will set up two spare-time schools.

    苏家屯机务段消灭笨重劳动减少乘务人员
    干线机车实现操作机械化
    本报讯　沈阳铁路局苏家屯机务段跑长途的机车全部实现了操作机械化半自动化，机车上消灭了推煤、烧火、摇炉、吹灰等笨重体力操作，取消了用铁锹烧火的司炉，使每台机车的乘务员由过去三个人减到两个人，由三班包改为四班包，彻底改变了乘务人员的劳动条件，增加了学习和休息时间，机车运用效率比过去提高4％—6％。
    机车操作机械化半自动化是我国铁路工人在技术革命运动中杰出的创造。从有铁路以来，干线蒸气机车就是三个人操作。今年2月，全国群英会代表、苏家屯机务段火车司机崔修范，在党委的启示下，在技术人员的协助下，改造出了第一台机械化半自动化机车，经领导部门鉴定认为可以普遍推广后，苏家屯机务段即从5月末开始全面推广这一先进技术，着手改造机车。
    在进行机车操作机械化半自动化改造中，党委书记亲自挂帅，领导干部深入车间亲临现场，昼夜跟班指挥，和工人同吃同劳动，出谋划策，终于在大干三十天中，将六十三台机车上煤全部改为自动操作。
    机车进行技术改造以后，使机车上最繁重的体力劳动——烧火，完全实现了机械化半自动化。过去机车运行时，副司机和司炉两个人轮换着站在烟熏火燎的锅炉口，用手一锹锹地往锅炉里投煤，平均每小时要投两吨多。而现在副司机坐在椅子上，用手拧闸阀，就可以自动添煤，这样就改变了蒸气机有史以来的乘务制，不再用司炉，实行了八人四班包车。
    乘务人员每班由三人改为两人，每台机车由三班制改为四班制，使乘务人员有足够的休息时间，可以保证安全行车。如过去从苏家屯到四平往返工作十二小时，乘务员的休息时间也只有二十四小时，而现在即可休息到三十六小时。这样全面推广以后，全段就办起了两所业余学校。
