Manage Mulberry Groves Well, Raise Enough Autumn Silkworms
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

The three months of August, September, and October are the prime time for autumn silkworm rearing. All regions should conscientiously summarize the experiences of high yields in spring and summer silkworms this year and raise enough autumn silkworms, striving for a bumper harvest of autumn cocoons.

Vigorously developing summer and autumn silkworm rearing is a product of the Great Leap Forward since 1958. Before 1957, the output of summer and autumn cocoons accounted for only about 20% of the total annual output. In 1958 and 1959, it rapidly rose to nearly 40%. Experience over the past two years has proven that the conditions for raising autumn silkworms are very favorable: mulberry trees grow rapidly after summer pruning, and when it comes to raising autumn silkworms, it is the time when mulberry leaves are growing luxuriantly, and mulberry leaves suitable for small or large silkworms can often be picked; the temperature gradually decreases, which is suitable for the growth and development of silkworms. In 1959, Lezhi County, Sichuan Province, raised 1,613 autumn silkworm sheets, with an average yield of 81.7 jin of cocoons per sheet. This shows that autumn silkworms can not only be raised in large quantities but can also achieve high yields and bumper harvests. However, the climate during the autumn silkworm rearing season is often abnormal, either dry or rainy, which can easily affect the growth of mulberry trees, resulting in insufficient feed and malnutrition for autumn silkworms. To strive for a bumper harvest of autumn silkworms, the most important task at present is to manage mulberry groves well and increase mulberry leaf production to create conditions for raising autumn silkworms well.

At present, it is a critical period for field management of mulberry groves. We should cultivate, weed, fertilize, prune, and remove pests well to promote more, longer, and stronger mulberry branches, increase autumn leaf production, and lay a good foundation for increasing mulberry leaf production in the spring of next year. To manage mulberry groves well, the first thing to do is to cultivate and weed in a timely manner to eliminate weeds. Weeding can not only increase soil fertility but also increase coverage, which plays a role in preserving moisture. Second, fertilize in a timely manner. Mulberry trees suffer great physiological damage after harvesting spring leaves and pruning branches. At the same time, the weather is hot now, and mulberry trees grow rapidly, requiring the most nutrients. Fertilization should be combined with cultivation and weeding to promote the continued vigorous growth of branches and leaves and increase autumn leaf production. Third, prune and remove pests. The pruning work of newly planted mulberry trees, arbor mulberry trees, and seedling mulberry trees is the key to enhancing tree vigor. Pruning branches can also reduce the hiding places of pests and prevent pests and diseases from harming them. Autumn is the peak season for mulberry tree pests, and we must resolutely implement the pest control policy of treating early, treating little, treating thoroughly, and combining chemical control with manual capture. We must make full preparations, prevent and control pests in a timely manner, and eliminate pests in the initial stage.

With mulberry leaves, we must also raise silkworms well to ensure a bumper harvest of cocoons. According to the experience of many regions, to raise autumn silkworms, we must grasp the timing and distribute silkworm eggs for rearing in stages and batches according to the temperature and the amount of mulberry leaf production. The early autumn silkworm season has basically ended. In areas where early autumn silkworms have been raised, disinfection should be carried out as soon as possible to prevent the spread of viruses. During the mid-autumn silkworm season, the temperature gradually decreases, and mulberry branches have also grown up, and the leaf production is suitable for silkworm rearing. We should make full use of this great opportunity to raise mid-autumn silkworms in large quantities and strive to raise enough and achieve high yields. After mid-autumn, if the mulberry groves are well managed, we can also raise a batch of late autumn silkworms. Such reasonable phased and batched rearing can not only improve the utilization rate of silkworm rearing rooms and tools, regulate labor, but also avoid high temperatures, enhance the physique of silkworms, and increase the unit yield of cocoons.

To manage mulberry trees well and raise silkworms well, there must be corresponding organizational measures. While doing a good job in grain production, all regions should strengthen leadership over silkworm production, rationally arrange labor, and conscientiously implement the three guarantees and one reward production responsibility system, so as to combine mulberry trees and silkworms, and agriculture and sericulture, so that the perennial management of mulberry groves and the seasonal production of silkworms are combined with each other. As long as the leadership grasps tightly and specifically, we will surely be able to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn cocoons.

    管好桑园　养足秋蚕
    本报评论员
    8 、9、10三个月正是秋季养蚕的大好时期，各地应当庄总结今年春蚕、夏蚕丰产经验的基础上，养足秋蚕，力争秋季蚕大丰收。
    大力发展夏季和秋季养蚕，是1958年大跃进以来的产物。1957年以前，夏蚕、秋茧产量只约占全年总产量的20%左右，1958、1950年己迅速上升到近40%。两年来经验证明，饲养秋蚕的条件是十分优越的：夏伐后桑树迅速生长，到饲养秋蚕时正是桑叶生长茂盛的时候，经常可以采到适合小蚕或大蚕吃的桑叶；气温逐渐降低，适合蚕儿生长发育。1959年四川省乐至县饲养秋蚕一千六百十三张，平均每张产茧八十一点七斤。这说明秋蚕不但能大量饲养，而且可以达到高产丰收。可是，养秋蚕时期，气候往往不正常，或干旱，或多雨，容易影响桑树生长，而造成秋蚕饲料不足和营养不良。为争取秋蚕丰收，当前最重要的任务是管好桑园，增产桑叶，为养好秋蚕创造条件。
    目前正是桑园田间管理的关键时期，应该很好地中耕、除草、施肥、整枝、除虫，促使桑树条多、条长、条壮，增产秋叶，并为明年春季桑叶增产打下良好基础。要管好桑园，首先要及时中耕除草　消灭草荒。除草既能增加土壤肥力，又可以增加复盖，起到保墒作用。第二，要及时施肥。桑树在采摘春叶和伐条以后，生理受到很大捐失；同时目前天气热，桑树生迅速，需要养分最多，应该结合中耕除草，及时施肥，促使枝叶继续旺盛生长，增加秋叶产量。第三，要整枝除虫。新栽桑、乔木桑、实生桑的整枝工作，是增强树势的关键；整修枝条还可以减少害虫潜伏场所，防止病虫为害。秋季正是桑树害虫盛发时期，必须坚决贯彻治少、治早、治了和药械防治与人工捕捉相结合的治虫方针，充分做好准备，及时防治，把害虫消灭在初发阶段。
    有了桑叶，还必须把蚕养好，才能保证蚕茧丰收。根据许多地区的经验，饲养秋蚕要切实掌握时机，按照气温的高低和桑叶产量的多少，发足蚕种分期分批饲养。早秋蚕已经基本结束，在养早秋蚕的地区结束后要抓紧时机进行消毒，防止病毒蔓延。中秋蚕期，气温渐降，桑条亦已成长，产叶量多适宜养蚕，应充分利用这个大好时机，大养中秋蚕，争取养足高产。中秋后，如果桑园管理的好，还可以养一批晚秋蚕。这样合理分期分批饲养，既可以提高蚕室、蚕具的利用率，调节劳力，又可以避免高温，增强蚕儿体质，提高蚕茧的单位产量。
    管好桑、养好蚕，一定要有相应的组织措施。各地在搞好粮食生产的同时，要加强对蚕桑生产的领导，合理安排劳动力，认真贯彻和执行三包一奖的生产责任制，做到桑、蚕结合，农蚕协作，使桑园的常年管理与养蚕的季节性生产相互结合。只要领导上抓得紧、抓得具体，一定能争取秋季蚕茧大丰收。
