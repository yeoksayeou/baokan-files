    This Dispatch: Yang Zaihua, the Party Branch Secretary of the Changpo Production Team in Chengguan Commune, Yinjiang County, Guizhou Province, shares the joys and hardships with the commune members in terms of food and clothing, manages household expenses without wasting a single penny, and doesn't take a single needle or thread from the team's wealth. Consequently, he has been repeatedly recognized as a good, honest, and selfless cadre in Yinjiang County.

    Yang Zaihua, a poor peasant in his fifties, has been wearing a straw hat, straw sandals, and wielding a hoe all year round since he became the chairman of the Farmers' Association during the land reform in 1951. He always takes the lead in working wherever he goes. The commune members say, "Our Secretary Yang always rushes to do the work, and lets the commune members enjoy the benefits; he is always in the fields, focusing on production." In labor and production, he always goes to work earlier than everyone else and leaves later. Last year, he worked two hundred and eighty workdays; this year, he worked one hundred and twenty-five workdays in the first half of the year. During the intense "double搶" (harvesting of early rice and planting of late rice) season, he was always in the forefront, never leaving the battlefield. Because he has been participating in and leading production, he is particularly familiar with the production conditions of each team. He knows exactly where to plant, which field needs topdressing, and when to harvest the crops in each field.

    Before liberation, Yang Zaihua worked as a farmhand for landlords for more than twenty years. After a year of hard work, he faced a miserable life of not having enough to eat and nothing to wear. He has always kept this painful experience firmly in his mind. Whenever he compares it with the beautiful life he has now, he always tells everyone about the life he led in the past, like that of a beast of burden, educating cadres and commune members to cherish the socialist money and grain and develop the socialist collective enterprise. Under the exemplary behavior of Comrade Yang Zaihua, the whole team has been meticulous in spending money, using the team's funds as much as possible where production needs it most. He is particularly concerned about the team's financial revenue and expenditure, and the procedures are also particularly strict. Expenditures from one yuan to three yuan must be personally approved by him, and expenditures over three yuan must be discussed and decided by the team committee. Every month, he also personally clears and announces the accounts of revenue and expenditure together with the accountant, and posts them to solicit the opinions of the commune members. Last year, the state supported the team with 3,500 yuan, which they used entirely to buy chemical fertilizer (ammonium sulfate) and applied it to the wheat and rapeseed fields, increasing the total output of summer crops by more than one and a half times this year. The public accumulation left over from this summer's distribution was also used to buy 6,000 catties of ammonium sulfate in time for topdressing rice. However, he keeps a tight rein on non-productive expenditures, without wasting a single penny. Once, when the team was paying wages, the accountant, Wu Mingchu, prepared to put the money due to each household in envelopes and distribute them to everyone. Yang Zaihua immediately stopped him when he found out, and said, "An envelope costs one and a half cents, and the whole team needs two hundred envelopes, which will cost three yuan."

    Yang Zaihua is wholeheartedly for the collective, with a clear distinction between public and private matters, and does not take a single penny from the team's wealth. The commune members say, "With Secretary Yang in charge, our money and grain are more secure than if they were in our own pockets. We are one hundred and twenty percent at ease!" Not only in economic matters, but also in daily life and work arrangements, Yang Zaihua is selfless. He always arranges for the four laborers in his family to do the heaviest and most tiring work first. Seeing that Comrade Yang Zaihua is old and works hard for everyone day and night, the team's cadres and masses try to give him more food during the canteen's extra meals, but Comrade Yang Zaihua resolutely refuses. In February of this year, Yang Zaihua was hospitalized for half a month due to chronic enteritis. The day after he was discharged from the hospital, the county notified him to go to Guiyang for a meeting. Liao Guozheng, the League branch secretary who had worked with him for many years, saw that he had just recovered from his illness and had to take a car, so he took money and bought some eggs in the canteen and put them in his cloth bag. When Comrade Yang Zaihua found eggs in his cloth bag when he got on the bus, he insisted on not taking them away. Liao Guozheng had to take the eggs back and distribute them to the elderly and sick commune members.

    Under the influence of Comrade Yang Zaihua, all the cadres and commune members of the Changpo Production Team have developed a habit of diligence and thrift, cherish the socialist collective enterprise, and have no household debts and every household has savings. The cadres and commune members all bring fertilizer to the fields when they go to work and bring firewood and vegetables to the canteen when they finish work, always thinking of the collective and contributing to the collective. The production upsurge rolls forward one after another.

### 头戴斗笠田间共劳动　队有财富不乱花分文  杨再华勤操社会主义大家业  在他的影响下，长坡生产队人人讲勤俭户户有储蓄

    头戴斗笠田间共劳动　队有财富不乱花分文
    杨再华勤操社会主义大家业
    在他的影响下，长坡生产队人人讲勤俭户户有储蓄
    本报讯　贵州省印江县城关公社长坡生产队党支部书记杨再华，吃穿与社员同甘共苦，持家用钱不乱花分文，队有财富不沾一针一线。因而连年被评为印江县廉洁奉公的好干部。
    年过半百的贫农杨再华，从1951年土地改革时期当农会主席起，十年来一直是头戴斗笠，脚穿草鞋，终年锄头不离身，出门见活带头干。社员们说：“我们的杨支书呀，有活抢着干，享受让社员；成天田中转，一心抓生产。”他在劳动生产上，总是出工在前，收工在后。去年，他做了二百八十个劳动日；今年上半年做了一百二十五个劳动日，在“双抢”的紧张战斗中，更是身先士卒，从没下过战场。由于他一直是参加生产、领导生产，对各小队的生产情况就特别熟悉，那里需要种，那块田该追肥，那块土的庄稼该收获，他心中记得一清二楚。
    杨再华在解放前给地主当了二十多年的长工，一年苦到头而换来的是吃不到口、衣不遮身的悲惨生活。这一段沉痛的经历，他一直牢牢记在心里，每当一对比眼前的美好生活，他总是给大家摆他过去所过的牛马生活，教育干部和社员爱惜社会主义的钱米，发展社会主义的家业。在杨再华同志模范行为的带动下，全队在用钱上做到了精打细算，把队里的资金尽量用到生产最急需的地方去。他对队里的财务收支特别关心，手续也格外严格，一元以上至三元的开支，他都要亲自批审，三元以上的开支还得召开队委会研究决定；每个月还要亲自和会计清理公布一次收支账目，张榜征求社员意见。国家在去年支援这个队的三千五百元资金，他们全部买了化学肥料（硫酸铵），施在小麦油菜田里，今年夏收作物总产量增加一倍半以上。今年夏季分配留下的公共积累，也及时买了硫酸铵六千斤追施水稻。但是对非生产性的开支，他都是卡的紧紧的，不乱花分文。有一次队里发工资，会计吴明初准备把每家应得的钱分装在信封里发给大家，杨再华知道后便立即制止了。并说：“一个信封一分五厘，全队要二百个信封，就得花三块钱”。
    杨再华一心为集体，公私分明，队有财富不沾分文。社员们说：“杨支书来当家，我们的钱米比放到自己腰包里还牢靠，硬是一百二十个的放心！”不但是在经济问题上，就是在日常生活和活路安排上，杨再华也是大公无私。他总是先把自己家中的四个劳力安排做最重、最累的活路。队里的干部和群众见杨再华同志年老，又日夜为大家操劳，食堂加餐时都尽量给他多盛些菜，但杨再华同志坚决谢绝。今年2月，杨再华因得慢性肠炎住院半月，出院第二天，县里又通知他上贵阳开会，跟他一块工作多年的团支书廖国正，见他病刚好又要坐车，就拿钱在食堂里买了几个鸡蛋，放到他的布口袋里。杨再华同志上车时发觉布口袋里有鸡蛋，坚持不肯带走。廖国正只好把鸡蛋拿回去分给年老生病的社员。
    在杨再华同志的影响下，长坡生产队的全体干部和社员，勤俭成风，个个爱惜社会主义的家业，家家不欠贷款，户户有储蓄。干部和社员都是上工带肥下田，收工给食堂带柴带菜，时时为集体着想，个个为集体出力，生产高潮一个接着一个滚滚向前。
