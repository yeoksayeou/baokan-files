Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th. According to reports in local newspapers: The Secretariat of the Vietnam Workers' Party Central Committee convened an agricultural cooperation conference for the entire northern region from August 2nd to 4th. The conference discussed the issues of developing and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives. Le Duan and Truong Chinh, members of the Political Bureau of the Vietnam Workers' Party Central Committee, and Tran Huu Duc, Minister of Rural Work, all spoke at the meeting.

    In his speech, Le Duan pointed out that the socialist transformation of agriculture and the development of agricultural production are paramount and crucial issues. He said that we should not only strive to basically complete agricultural cooperation (the establishment of elementary agricultural production cooperatives) by the end of this year, but also strive to continuously improve the quality of the agricultural cooperation movement, which means paying more attention to the political and ideological work of agricultural cooperatives and more attention to the labor production of agricultural cooperatives.

    Truong Chinh emphasized at the meeting that from now until the late rice harvest, the development of agricultural production cooperatives should be the main focus, while consolidation work must also be emphasized. He called on the entire party to carry forward the revolutionary spirit and actively complete the task of developing and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives this autumn, in order to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the country (September 2nd) and welcome the convening of the Third Party Congress (early September).

    According to the decision, this autumn, the development targets for agricultural, fishery, and salt production cooperatives in northern Vietnam should reach 70%-75% of the total number of agricultural, fishery, and salt households, with an average development target of 75% for agricultural production cooperatives.

    As of the 6th, the number of farmers and fishermen in northern Vietnam who have joined agricultural and fishery production cooperatives has reached 55% of the total number of agricultural and fishery households.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 8th. The broad masses of workers and staff in Czechoslovakia's industrial sector are vigorously supporting agriculture. Last year, the agricultural machinery industry increased the number of grain combine harvesters for agriculture by 800, and this year it will increase by 1,300, so that 22% of the grain will be harvested using this type of harvester. Last year, they submitted 3,000 threshing machines to agriculture, and this year it will increase to 3,500; the production of wheeled tractors will also increase from 10,171 last year to 12,600. In addition, workers this year have also produced many new agricultural machines, such as multi-purpose forage harvesters for harvesting silage and straw, four-row potato planters, and precision beet seeders.

    Factories and enterprises across the country have established close ties with nearby agricultural cooperatives. Workers often assist cooperatives in formulating production plans, solving technical problems, helping cooperative members organize socialist labor competitions, and establishing groups to strive for the title of "Socialist Labor Team." Workers at the Tatra factory in Kopřivnice are tutoring fifteen cooperatives in the Ostrava region. They pay special attention to finding ways to help backward cooperatives. Thanks to their joint efforts with cooperative members, the Hukovice cooperative, which had been relatively backward, has been greatly strengthened.

    The foundry workers of the Vitkovice Iron and Steel Plant in Ostrava worked nearly 30,000 work hours in the cooperatives they tutored in the first half of this year. In addition, they accumulated 50,000 cubic meters of mixed fertilizer for the cooperatives. Workers at the Sigma-Lutín pump factory specially produced a special type of water pump powered by a diesel engine for farmers, and they periodically lend this type of water pump to nearby cooperatives.

    In the national movement to improve soil, workers helped farmers do a total of 1,378,500 work shifts in the first half of this year.

    越南全北方农业合作化会议发出号召
    争取今年基本完成农业合作化
    捷各地工厂企业同附近的农业合作社建立紧密联系
    新华社河内7日电　据此间报纸报道：越南劳动党中央书记处在8月2日至4日召开全北方农业合作化会议，会议讨论了发展和巩固农业生产合作社的问题。越南劳动党中央政治局委员黎笋、长征，农村工作部部长陈友翼都在会上讲了话。
    黎笋在讲话中指出，农业的社会主义改造和发展农业生产是头等重要的关键问题。他说，我们不仅要争取在今年年底基本上完成农业合作化（建立初级农业生产合作社的合作化），而且还要为不断提高农业生产合作化运动的质量而奋斗，办法就是更加关心农业社的政治和思想工作，更加关心农业社的劳动生产。
    长征在会上强调指出，从现在到晚造收获以前，要以发展农业生产合作社为主，同时必须重视巩固工作。他号召全党发扬革命精神，积极完成今年秋季发展和巩固农业生产合作社的任务，以庆祝建国十五周年（9月2日）和迎接第三次党代表大会（9月上旬）的召开。
    据决定，今年秋季越南北方农业、渔业和盐业生产合作社的发展指标要达到农、渔、盐业总户数的70％—75％，其中农业生产合作社的平均发展指标为75％。
    截至6日为止，越南北方农民和渔民加入农业和渔业生产合作社的户数已分别达到农渔业总户数的55％。
    新华社布拉格8日电　捷克斯洛伐克工业部门的广大职工正在大力支援农业。去年农业机器工业为农业增加了八百台谷物联合收割机，而今年将增加一千三百台，使22％的谷物都将能用这种收割机来收获。去年他们提交给农业的打谷机有三千台，而今年将增加到三千五百台；轮式拖拉机的生产也将从去年的一万零一百七十一台增加到一万二千六百台。此外，工人们今年还生产了许多新式农业机器，如收割青贮饲料和稻草用的万能饲料收割机、四行马铃薯种植机、甜菜精密播种机等。
    全国各地的工厂企业都同附近的农业合作社建立了紧密的联系。工人们经常协助合作社制订生产计划、解决技术问题，帮助社员们组织社会主义劳动竞赛和建立争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的小组等。科普日夫尼泽的塔特拉工厂的工人就辅导着俄斯特拉发州的十五个合作社。他们特别注意设法帮助落后的社。由于他们和社员的共同努力，一向比较落后的胡科维第合作社已经大大加强了。
    俄斯特拉发的维特科维泽钢铁厂的翻砂工人今年上半年在他们辅导的合作社工作了将近三万个工时。此外，还为合作社积了五万立方米的混合肥料。西革马—鲁延唧筒厂的工人专为农民生产了一种用柴油机发动的特种抽水机，他们把这种抽水机定期出借给附近的合作社。
    在改良土壤的全国性运动中，今年上半年工人们共帮助农民做了一百三十七万八千五百工作班的工作。
