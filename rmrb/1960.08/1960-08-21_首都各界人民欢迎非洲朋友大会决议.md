Xinhua News Agency, August 20th. The people of the capital welcome the resolutions of the African Friends Conference. The full text is as follows:

    The people of all circles in the capital of China solemnly held a meeting on August 20th to warmly welcome the Zanzibar Nationalist Party delegation headed by Mirat Sherab Abdul, the Sierra Leone delegation headed by Ibrahim Kargbo, the delegation of the People's Liberation Movement of Angola, the delegation of the African Independence Party of Portuguese Guinea, and Chairman Kezhang Jizi of the Southwest African National Union, and through them, to extend brotherly and fighting salutations to the people of their countries who are engaged in heroic struggles.
    The conference solemnly declared that 650 million Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the people of Zanzibar, Sierra Leone, Angola, Portuguese Guinea, and Southwest Africa against imperialism, colonialism, and for independence and freedom.
    The conference heartily congratulated the people of Zanzibar on the victory they have achieved in their struggle against the establishment of missile bases by U.S. imperialism in Zanzibar, and wished them new and greater victories.
    The conference sternly condemned the Portuguese colonialists' bloody suppression of the people in Angola and Portuguese Guinea, demanding an immediate end to the massacres and persecution of the people of Angola and Portuguese Guinea, and the immediate release of all arrested patriots. The conference sternly condemned the fascist rule and barbaric racial persecution of imperialism and the Union of South Africa in Southwest Africa, and sternly condemned the imperialist oppression of the people of Sierra Leone and the conspiracy and crimes of establishing military bases there. The Chinese people resolutely demand that all imperialist forces immediately get out of Zanzibar! Get out of Sierra Leone! Get out of Angola and Portuguese Guinea! Get out of Southwest Africa! Get out of the whole of Africa completely!
    The conference unanimously pointed out that U.S. imperialism is invading Africa on a large scale from all sides, seriously threatening the independence and freedom of the African people. The conference called on the people of Asia, Africa, and the world to strengthen unity and vigilance, and to wage unremitting struggles against their common enemy—U.S. imperialism.
    The conference reiterated that the Chinese people are willing to further develop friendship with the African people, and to strengthen unity and mutual support in the common struggle against imperialism. The Chinese people will always stand on the side of the African people and fight to the end to end colonial rule and oppose imperialism. We firmly believe that with the strong support and encouragement of the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the world, the increasingly awakened African people, relying on their own unity and tenacious struggle, will surely overcome any difficulties, smash the imperialist conspiracies, and thus win the final victory of independence and freedom.
    Long live the great independence and freedom of the African people!
    Long live the friendly unity between the Chinese and African people!
                            August 20, 1960, Beijing
