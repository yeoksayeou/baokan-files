Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing. Guided by the principle of "taking agriculture as the foundation," Jintan County, Jiangsu Province, has adopted effective measures of "finding sources, prioritizing uses, and grasping results" throughout the county, concentrating over 90% of its materials on the front line of agricultural production, thereby strongly supporting agricultural production.

Taking rice transplanters as an example, thanks to the timely and sufficient supply of raw materials and materials, a total of 1,700 units were manufactured throughout the county this year, with 1,100 units used in summer planting. The work efficiency is four times faster than manual transplanting, accumulating a total saving of more than 50,000 workdays, greatly accelerating the progress of summer planting. Last year, the rice planting season started at the Summer Solstice; this year, it ended at the Summer Solstice. The repair and manufacture of small farm tools throughout the county have also overfulfilled the plan.

This year, the Jintan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party found that some cadres had a "stressing industry over agriculture" ideology. This ideology manifested in the distribution of materials, often favoring industry. Within the industrial sector, most materials were used for capital construction, with a smaller proportion used for the production of agricultural production materials. When Chen Zhonglian, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, went to work at the grassroots level, he learned about these situations and problems. Upon returning to the County Party Committee, he immediately inspected the arrangements and supply of agricultural materials by the planning and supply and marketing departments. After discussion, the County Committee immediately took effective measures.

First, leadership was strengthened organizationally, and a "Leading Group for Supporting Agriculture" was established by relevant departments such as industry, finance and trade, and the planning committee. The First Secretary of the County Party Committee took personal charge, with a Deputy Secretary responsible for specific work. The principle of "obeying agriculture, while also taking into account other aspects" was established in the allocation of materials, rapidly changing the tendency of emphasizing industry over agriculture. Since the second quarter, 80% of the timber used in the county has been used for agriculture; 91% of diesel fuel has also been used for agriculture, thus ensuring the need for agricultural drainage and irrigation fuel.

Second, the County Party Committee adopted the methods of finding sources, prioritizing uses, and grasping results, organizing more materials from all aspects to support agriculture, and better using materials on the "cutting edge." Finding sources mainly involved tapping the potential of local materials and finding ways to save and substitute. This year, the county saved 157 tons of diesel and 3,513 tons of coal, ensuring the normal operation and timely irrigation of waterwheels throughout the county. In order to eliminate rice borers, the county has now fully prepared 60 tons of kerosene, more than double the actual amount used last year.

Prioritizing uses means giving priority to agriculture in the use of materials. In the implementation, they compressed what could be compressed to the lowest limit. For example, timber originally allocated to factories and agencies for repairing houses was withdrawn to support agricultural production. The same was true for communes and brigades. For example, the farm tool factory of Yaotang Commune released timber originally intended for making desks to repair 56 agricultural boats, and squeezed out 46 bamboo poles for the brigade to manufacture three windmills.

Grasping results means not only ensuring that the allocation of materials is implemented, but also ensuring that the use is implemented and the results are good. The County Party Committee determined that agricultural machinery factories, commercial departments, and other relevant departments should ensure that the materials allocated to agriculture are truly used on the "cutting edge," ensuring that large and small farm tools are basically complete and not lacking.

    找来源  排用途  抓效果
    金坛县集中物资供应农业
    新华社南京讯　江苏省金坛县在“以农业为基础”的思想指导下，全县采取了“找来源、排用途、抓效果”的有效措施，集中了90％以上的物资用到农业生产第一线，有力地支援了农业生产。
    以插秧机为例，由于原料、物资供应较及时充分，今年全县共制造了一千七百台，在夏种中使用的有一千一百台，工效比人工栽插快四倍，积累起来共计节约了五万多个劳动日，大大加速了夏种进度。去年是夏至开秧门，今年是夏至关秧门。全县修制的小农具也都超额完成了计划。
    今年，中共金坛县委发现部分干部中存在着“重工轻农”的思想。这种思想表现在物资分配上，往往偏重于工业。在工业部门内部，大部分物资使用在基本建设方面，用于有关农业生产资料生产方面的比数少。县委第一书记陈忠廉深入基层工作时，了解到这些情况和问题，回到县委立即检查了计划部门和供销部门对于农业用物资的安排和供应工作。县委会经过讨论，立即采取了有效措施。
    首先在组织上加强领导，由工业、财贸、计委等有关部门成立“支援农业的领导小组”。县委第一书记亲自挂帅，由一名副书记负责具体工作。确定在物资分配上“服从农业、兼顾其他”的原则，迅速改变了重工轻农的偏向。全县从第二季度以来，用于农业的木材占80％；柴油也有91％用于农业，因而保证了农业排灌燃料的需要。
    其次，县委采取了找来源、排用途、抓效果的办法，从各方面组织更多的物资支援农业，更好地把物资用在“刀口”上。找来源主要是挖掘本地物资潜力和寻找节约、代用办法。今年全县节约柴油一百五十七吨，煤炭三千五百一十三吨，保证了全县戽水机的正常运转和及时灌溉。为了消灭螟害，目前全县已备足火油六十吨，比去年的实用数增加了一倍多。
    排用途是把物资首先用到农业上去。他们在执行中，把可以压缩的，压缩到最低限度。如把原来分给工厂和机关修房子的木材，抽出来支援农业生产。公社、大队也是这样。如尧塘公社农具厂，把原来准备做课桌用的木材，让出来修理了五十六只农船，挤出四十六根毛竹给大队制造三部风车。
    抓效果是不仅要使物资分配落实，而且要做到使用落实，效果良好。县委确定农业机械厂、商业等有关部门，要保证把分给农业的物资真正用在“刀口”上，做到大小农具基本完整不缺。
