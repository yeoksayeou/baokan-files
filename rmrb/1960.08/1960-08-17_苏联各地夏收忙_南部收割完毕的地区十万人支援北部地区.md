Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 15th: Throughout the vast lands of the Soviet Union, the intense harvesting work is rapidly progressing from south to north and from west to east.

As of August 5th, grain crops had been harvested on 40.5 million hectares, accounting for nearly 40% of the total grain crop area. Harvesting has been completed in most of the southern regions of the Soviet Union. The harvest work in Ukraine and the North Caucasus is nearing completion. Now, the harvesting front has crossed the Ural region and is approaching the central part of Siberia and the northern region of Kazakhstan. The boundless newly cultivated areas of Kazakhstan and Siberia present a scene of abundant harvest, and harvesting is about to begin here.

The southern and western regions that have already completed harvesting have dispatched large support forces to help other regions with harvesting. 100,000 people from the southern regions have been sent to support the harvesting work in Kazakhstan, including 40,000 students from agricultural mechanization schools. Several tens of thousands of young people from the western regions, responding to the call of the Communist Youth League, have also volunteered to come to Kazakhstan to help with harvesting.

Soviet industrial enterprises have actively supported the agricultural harvesting work. Without affecting production, enterprises in Altai have drawn thousands of workers as tractor drivers and combine harvesters to support harvesting.

While harvesting is proceeding intensely in various places, a competition to complete the delivery of summer grain ahead of schedule has been launched.

Agricultural workers in Kuban and the Don region completed their plans for the sale of summer grain on July 31st and August 3rd, respectively.

In the southern regions where wheat harvesting has been completed, other agricultural tasks are underway. Some collective farms are harvesting corn and sunflowers, while others are plowing the land to prepare for autumn sowing.

    苏联各地夏收忙
    南部收割完毕的地区十万人支援北部地区
    新华社莫斯科15日电　在苏联的辽阔土地上，紧张的收割工作正从南向北、从西向东地迅速推进。
    截至8月5日，谷物作物已经收割了四千零五十万公顷，即差不多占谷物作物总面积的40％。苏联南部大多数地区已经收割完毕。乌克兰和北高加索的收获工作即将结束。现在，收割面已经穿过乌拉尔地区，临近西伯利亚中部和哈萨克北部地区。哈萨克和西伯利亚的一望无际的新垦区呈现出一片丰收的景象，这里即将开镰收割。
    南部和西部已经收割完毕的地区，派出了支援大军去帮助别的地区收割。从南部地区派出了十万人支援哈萨克的收割工作，其中有四万名是农业机械化学校的学生。西部地区有几万青年响应共青团的号召，也纷纷自愿前来哈萨克帮助收割。
    苏联各工业企业积极支援了农业收割工作。阿尔泰各企业在不影响生产的情况下，从工人中抽调了几千人作拖拉机手和联合收割机手支援收割。
    各地在紧张收割的同时，展开了提前完成交售夏粮的竞赛。
    库班和顿河的农业劳动者已经分别在7月31日和8月3日完成了交售夏粮的计划。
    在完成麦收的南部地区，正在进行其他农活，有的集体农庄在收割玉蜀黍和向日葵，有的集体农庄在翻耕土地准备秋播。
