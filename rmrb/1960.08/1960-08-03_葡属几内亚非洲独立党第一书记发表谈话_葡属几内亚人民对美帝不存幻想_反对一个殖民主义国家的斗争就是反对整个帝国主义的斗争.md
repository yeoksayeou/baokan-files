Xinhua News Agency, Conakry: Abel Djassi, First Secretary of the African Independence Party (Portuguese Guinea), recently condemned U.S. imperialism for supporting colonialism and opposing African national independence movements in a conversation with Xinhua reporters. He emphasized that U.S. imperialism is now replacing Portuguese colonialists in ruling the people of Portuguese Guinea.

He said, "We harbor no illusions about U.S. imperialism or any other form of imperialism." He said that Portugal, as a colonialist country, is now a loyal servant of U.S. imperialism. The Portuguese colonial government has granted a huge privilege to an American enterprise, allowing it to plunder our country's various fuels, mainly oil, at will. He believes that Eisenhower's recent trip to Portugal was a concrete support for Portuguese colonial rule. He also said that the U.S. ambassador to Portugal recently visited Portuguese Guinea accompanied by Portuguese colonial authorities. Some of the remarks made after the visit showed that he fully supported the oppression of the people of Portuguese Guinea by Portuguese colonialism.

Abel Djassi said, "I will always remember the fact that the Americans who came to our country to seize our oil and other fuels are not thinking of our people at all. They are strengthening the racial discrimination already practiced by the Portuguese in the role of masters."

He said, "We who are struggling understand that the struggle against one colonialist country is a struggle against all of imperialism."

Speaking of the most brutal violent rule implemented by Portuguese colonialists, Djassi said that the people of Portuguese Guinea do not enjoy even the most basic human rights. Political organizations and trade unions are prohibited by the colonial authorities and the police.

He pointed out that out of the total population of 600,000 in Portuguese Guinea, 99.7% of Africans do not even enjoy citizenship. They are considered "uncivilized" people by Portuguese colonial law.

He said that in military terms, the Portuguese colonialists began to strengthen their military power last year. Many African troops were forcibly incorporated into the colonial army. Two thousand soldiers and thirty paratroopers were transferred from Portugal.

He also said that the colonial authorities exercise strict control over the economic life of the people of Portuguese Guinea. There, workers' wages are the lowest in Africa, and they live in hunger. About 70,000 farmers are forced to grow peanuts, and then sell their products to colonial merchants at low prices stipulated by the authorities.

He said that the African Independence Party of Portuguese Guinea has established a front uniting all anti-colonialist organizations to fight for the liberation of Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde.

The First Secretary of the African Independence Party finally said that the nature of colonialism determines that it is one of the most disastrous forms of violence. However, violence can be answered with violence. We have enough reason not to believe that colonialism can really be eliminated without the use of violence.

    葡属几内亚非洲独立党第一书记发表谈话
    葡属几内亚人民对美帝不存幻想
    反对一个殖民主义国家的斗争就是反对整个帝国主义的斗争
    据新华社科纳克里电　非洲独立党（葡属几内亚）第一书记阿贝耳·贾西最近在向新华社记者发表谈话时，谴责美帝国主义支持殖民主义者和反对非洲民族独立运动。他强调指出，美帝国主义现在正在代替葡萄牙殖民主义者统治葡属几内亚人民。
    他说，对于美帝国主义或者其它帝国主义，我们是不存有幻想的。他说，作为殖民主义国家的葡萄牙现在是美帝国主义的忠实仆从。葡萄牙殖民政府给了一家美国企业巨大的特权，使这家美国企业可以任意地掠夺我国以石油为主的各种燃料。他认为不久前艾森豪威尔的葡萄牙之行正是对葡萄牙殖民统治的一次具体支持。他还说，美国驻葡萄牙大使不久前在葡萄牙殖民当局的陪同下访问了葡属几内亚，访问之后发表的一些谈话表明了他是完全支持葡萄牙殖民主义对葡属几内亚人民所实行的压迫的。
    阿贝耳·贾西说，我将永远记住这个事实，为了侵占我国的石油和其它燃料而来到我国的美国人，根本不是为我国人民着想，他们以老爷身份加强葡萄牙已经实行的种族歧视。
    他说，正在进行斗争的我们懂得：反对一个殖民主义国家的斗争，就是反对整个帝国主义的斗争。
    贾西在谈到葡萄牙殖民主义者所实行的最残酷的暴力统治时说，葡属几内亚人民连人的最起码的基本权利都享受不到。政治组织和工会组织都遭到殖民当局和警察的禁止。
    他指出，在葡属几内亚的六十万人的总人口中，占99.7％的非洲人甚至享受不到公民权，他们被葡萄牙殖民法律认为是“不文明”的人。
    他说，在军事方面，葡萄牙殖民主义者去年着手加强军事力量。许多非洲军队被强行编入殖民军。从葡萄牙又调来二千名士兵和三十名伞兵。
    他还说，殖民当局对葡属几内亚人民的经济生活实行严格的控制。在那里，劳动者的报酬是非洲最低的，他们过着饥饿的生活。大约有七万户农民被迫种植花生，然后把产品按当局规定的低价卖给殖民商人。
    他说，葡属几内亚的非洲独立党建立了一个团结所有反殖民主义组织的、为解放葡属几内亚和佛得角而斗争的阵线。
    非洲独立党第一书记最后说，殖民主义的本性决定了它自己是暴力的最灾难性的形式之一。然而暴力可以用暴力回答。我们有足够的理由不相信不使用暴力就真的可以消灭殖民主义。
