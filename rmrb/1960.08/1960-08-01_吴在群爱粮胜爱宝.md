In the Henan dryland area of Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, facing the Tongyang Canal, stands a grain depot praised by everyone – the Liumiao Grain Depot of the Liumiao Brigade of the Wuqiao Commune.

Visitors entering the Liumiao Grain Depot will see that the walls of the warehouse are whitewashed and spotless, with not a speck of dust to be found. The tall grain stacks are arranged neatly, each with a clear and simple grain stack card, making it easy to know what kind of grain is stored inside and how much. At the entrance of the warehouse, four signs are hung: "Seeds," "Food Grain," "Feed," and "Reserve Grain," clearly distinguishing the use of each type of grain and implementing dedicated grain for dedicated purposes and dedicated storage. Inside the warehouse, there are also three "Peace Jars" filled with water, as well as a "water dragon" (water pump). All of this is arranged in an orderly manner.

Wu Zaiqun is the custodian of this grain depot, which is praised by everyone.

Wu Zaiqun often says: "Grain is the lifeline. With grain in hand, there's no need to panic. Not even an ounce or a penny's worth should be wasted." He heard that doctors check on patients by taking their temperature three times a day, so he also checks the grain stacks three times a day. If he discovers traces of rats or insect pests, he will investigate thoroughly until they are eliminated. If he finds that the grain is damp or heating up, he will immediately ventilate and sun it, and will not rest until it meets the standards. On windy and rainy days, he stays awake all night to check and protect the grain. Once, in the middle of the night, there was a sudden thunderstorm with rain so heavy that people couldn't even walk out of their houses. However, Wu Zaiqun still wore a bamboo hat and took a flashlight, running from the front to the back of the house, carefully checking if the grain had been wet. He didn't sleep a wink all night, his eyes bloodshot, but he still insisted on working the next day.

In the grain depot managed by Wu Zaiqun, there is not a single grain of spilled grain to be seen on the ground. Once, he found some rice embedded in the cracks of the bricks. He carefully squatted on the ground, took a small bamboo stick, and picked out the rice grains one by one from the brick cracks. Someone saw it and said, "Old Wu is really too foolish! Is it worth spending so much effort on these few grains of rice?" Wu Zaiqun replied, "Don't underestimate these few grains of rice. They are all earned with sweat and hard work. How can we waste them casually?" Once, the Second Team brought more than two thousand catties of paddy rice to be stored in Wu Zaiqun's grain depot. This batch of grain had a high moisture content and was so hot that you couldn't even put your hand in it. He thought that it didn't matter if the grain belonged to the brigade or the team, it was all the fruit of the commune members' labor, and not a single grain could be allowed to spoil. So, he turned over the grain all night long, spreading it out to cool. The next day, as soon as the sun came out, he immediately carried it to the threshing ground to dry, so the more than two thousand catties of rice suffered no loss at all.

For more than five years, Wu Zaiqun has lived up to the trust placed in him by the Party and the broad masses of commune members, and has managed the revolutionary affairs entrusted to him by the Party well. Therefore, the Yangzhou Special District and the commune leadership awarded him two red flags and awarded him the honorary title of model grain custodian of the commune.

    吴在群爱粮胜爱宝
    在江苏江都县河南旱谷地区，面对着通扬运河，有一座人人夸赞的好粮库——吴桥公社陆庙大队的陆庙粮库。
    参观的人走进陆庙粮库，就能看到仓库四壁粉饰得洁白，找不到一点灰尘。一座座高高的粮囤，排列在一起十分整齐，每个粮囤上挂着简单明了的粮囤卡，一看就知道囤里装着什么粮食，有多少。在仓库门口，分别挂着“种子”、“口粮”、“饲料”、“储备粮”四块牌子，把粮食的用途也分得一清二楚，实行了专粮专用，专仓保管。在仓库里边，还放着三只“太平缸”，缸里满满地盛着清水，此外还有一部“水龙”，所有这一切都安排得井井有条。
    吴在群就是这个人人夸奖的粮库的保管员。
    吴在群常这样说：“粮食是命根子，手里有粮，心里不慌，那怕一两一钱，都不许糟蹋。”他听人说医生看护病人，一天要量三次体温，所以他也一天要查看三次粮囤。在检查中，发现了鼠迹、虫害，一定查究到底，直到消灭为止。发现粮食回潮、发热，立即就通风、翻晒，不合标准决不歇手。在大风大雨的日子，就成夜不眠地检查和保护粮食。有一次，深夜里忽然下雷阵大雨，大得连人都走不出屋子。可是，吴在群仍旧戴着一顶凉篷，拿着手电筒，从屋前跑到屋后，仔细检查打湿了粮食没有？整整一夜没有合眼，熬红了眼睛，第二天还坚持工作。
    在吴在群管理的粮仓里，地上看不到一粒抛撒的粮食。有一次，他发现砖缝里嵌了一些稻子，就细心地蹲在地下，手拿一根小小的竹片子，把稻子一粒一粒地从砖缝里剔出来。有人见了就说道：“老吴做事真太愚啦！这点点粮食还值得花这样的功夫？”吴在群回答说：“不要小看了这点粮食，都是用汗水和心血换来的，怎么能随便糟蹋呢？”有一次，第二小队拿来两千多斤脚稻，寄放在吴在群的粮仓里。这批粮食水分很高，热得连手都插不进去。他想不问粮食是大队的还是小队的，一样都是社员的劳动果实，一粒也不能让它坏掉。于是，他整整的翻了一夜折子，把粮食摊开来吹凉。第二天太阳一出来，马上挑到场上去晒，因而两千多斤稻子，一点没有遭到损失。
    五年多来，吴在群不辜负党和广大社员的重托，管好了党交给他管理的这份革命家务。因此，扬州专区和公社的领导上，奖给了他两面红旗，获得了公社标兵粮食保管员的光荣称号。
