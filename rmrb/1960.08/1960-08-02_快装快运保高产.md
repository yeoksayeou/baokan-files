In organizing a great leap forward in steel production, the Wuyang Steel Plant in Henan Province, led by its Party Secretary, focused on transportation, loading and unloading, dispatching, road maintenance, and vehicle repair, rushing to transport steel raw materials and fuel. In twenty-five days of July, the volume of iron and steel materials transported increased by one time compared with the same period in June. Calculated according to the existing furnaces in the entire plant, one day's transportation can supply the plant's needs for two days. Thanks to the sufficient supply of raw materials and fuel, the plant's pig iron production in the first twenty-five days of July increased by 40% compared with the same period in June.
