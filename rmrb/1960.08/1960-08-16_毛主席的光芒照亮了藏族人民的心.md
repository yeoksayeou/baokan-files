    Chairman Mao's Radiance Illuminates the Hearts of the Tibetan People
    Cai Danzhuoma
    The fact that I could come to the capital to attend the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers is something I never imagined in the past. I am the child of a Tibetan serf. My grandfather and father were both serfs. If it hadn't been for liberation, we would have remained serfs for generations. Only under the leadership and care of the Party and Chairman Mao could I have the happiness and honor I have today.
    Four years ago, although Tibet had already been liberated, reform had not yet been carried out. I was in Shigatse, working for the serf owners every day like an animal, not getting enough to eat or wear, and sometimes even being whipped by the serf owners. I loved to sing since I was a child, but I didn't have the opportunity to sing back then. I could only sing Tibetan opera with my father when working in the fields.
    In 1956, an organization of young activists was established in Shigatse, and many young people often went to meetings and studies. I was very envious and also participated. Since I joined the youth organization led by the Party, my life began to change greatly. In that year, I went to Lhasa to attend the Tibetan Youth Congress. During the conference, I was approved to join the Communist Youth League. From that moment on, I transformed from an ordinary serf's daughter into a young person with revolutionary ideals. After the closing of the Youth Congress, the Party sent me and representatives from other regions to visit various parts of the country. From September 1956 to February 1957, I, who had never left my hometown, visited fourteen provinces and cities across the country. I saw the new steel city of Anshan, the largest industrial city in the country, Shanghai, and also went to Wuhan, Guangzhou… I not only saw the greatness of the motherland, but also the beauty of socialist life. I began to realize that there was a kind of life in this world where no one exploited anyone. After the visit, when I returned to Beijing, Chairman Mao also received us. I was very excited. I never thought that a child of a serf like me could meet the great leader of all ethnic groups.
    Later, the organization transferred me to the Shigatse Song and Dance Troupe. I learned many Tibetan folk songs and classical songs there. Many of our Tibetan comrades were uneducated and had low political awareness. In order to cultivate us, the organization decided to send the entire troupe to the Xi'an Tibetan Public School for study.
    After studying at the Tibetan Public School for six months, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music admitted me to the National Music Class to specialize in vocal music. The Party Committee of the school attached great importance to the studies of our ethnic minority students, assigned the best teachers to teach us, and greatly respected our national styles and characteristics. In the past two years, under the Party's patient cultivation and meticulous care, I have made great progress politically and artistically.
    When I first arrived at the Conservatory of Music, I couldn't understand a single word of Chinese, which made it very difficult to attend classes. The teachers and students helped me very warmly and helped me learn Chinese anytime, anywhere. Thanks to the help of my classmates, I was able to speak Chinese in less than half a year. The students also helped me prepare lessons and review. When I practiced the piano, if there was even one note or one beat that was wrong, they would run from a distant room to remind me. The students of other ethnic groups in the National Class were also very concerned about me, which made me feel like I was truly living in a united and mutually supportive big family. I felt that I could not let down the Party's cultivation of me, and I must not be afraid of difficulties, but must study hard. Later, when we went to the countryside to work, we saw the rural people's communes, saw the soaring enthusiasm of the commune members, and saw the elderly in the commune's homes for the elderly and the children in the nurseries. They lived so happily, which reminded me of the tragic life of the Tibetan people in the past. I felt that communization was also the path that the Tibetan people should take in the future.
    This time, my participation in the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers made me particularly clear about the issue of literary and art must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, how to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the ideological transformation that literary and art workers must undergo. I must study diligently: study Mao Zedong's works, study professional skills, and improve my political and musical level. Although I come from the working people, I still need to go to factories and rural areas more often, participate in labor, and share weal and woe with the working people. Only in this way can I better implement the Party's literary and art policy and better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    This time, at the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, Chairman Mao and the responsible comrades of the Central Committee met with all the representatives again, which made me feel extremely happy. I will never forget the Party's cultivation, education, and care for me. I will always follow the Party, listen to the Party, and do whatever the Party asks me to do, and contribute everything I have to the people and the revolution.
        The sun of the East is rising,
        Chairman Mao's radiance shines in all directions,
        Illuminating the Tibetan people's liberation,
        Illuminating our hearts brightly.

    毛主席的光芒照亮了藏族人民的心
    才旦卓玛
    我这次能够到首都来参加全国文代大会，是我过去想不到的事情。我是一个西藏农奴的孩子，我的祖父、父亲都是农奴，要不是解放，我们世世辈辈还得做农奴。只有在党和毛主席的领导和关怀下，我才能有现在这样的幸福和光荣。
    四年以前，西藏虽然已经解放了，还没有进行改革，我在日喀则，每天像牛马一样地为农奴主劳动，吃不饱，穿不暖，有时还要挨农奴主的皮鞭。我从小很喜欢唱歌，可是那时候没有机会唱，只有在田里劳动的时候，跟着父亲唱唱藏戏。
    1956年，日喀则有了青年积极分子的组织，许多青年都常常去开会、学习。我非常羡慕，也去参加了。自从我参加了党领导的青年组织以后，我的生活开始发生了很大的变化。这一年，我到拉萨参加了西藏青年代表大会，就在会议期间，我被批准了参加青年团。从这时候开始，我从一个普通的农奴的女儿，变成了一个有革命理想的青年。青年代表大会闭幕后，党派我和别个地区的代表一起到全国各地去参观。从1956年9月到1957年2月，我这个从来没有离开过家乡一步的人，参观了全国十四个省市，看到了新的钢铁城鞍山市，到过全国最大的工业城市上海，还到了武汉、广州……我不但看到了祖国的伟大，而且看到了社会主义生活的美好。我开始知道，这个世界上还有一种没有人剥削人的生活。参观以后，回到北京，毛主席还接见了我们。我非常激动，我真想不到像我这样一个农奴的孩子能够见到伟大的各族人民的领袖。
    后来组织上调我到日喀则歌舞团去工作，我在那里学会了很多西藏民歌、古典歌曲。我们很多藏族同志都没有文化，政治水平也很低，组织上为了培养我们，决定全团到西安西藏公学去学习。
    在西藏公学学习了六个月，上海音乐学院吸收我到音乐学院民族班专门学习声乐。学校党委非常重视我们少数民族同学的学习，指定最好的老师来教我们，并且非常尊重我们的民族风格和特色。这两年来，我在党的耐心的培养和无微不至的关怀下，政治上和艺术上得到了很大提高。
    我刚到音乐学院的时候，汉语一句也听不懂，上课非常困难。老师和同学们非常热情地帮助我，随时随地帮助我学汉语。由于同学的帮助，我在不到半年的时间内，就能用汉语讲话了。同学们还帮助我备课、复习。我练钢琴，只要有一个音符、一个拍子不对，他们就会从很远的房间跑来提醒我。民族班里其他各个民族的同学对我也都非常关心，使我感到真正生活在一个团结互助的民族大家庭。我觉得我不能辜负党对我的培养，不能怕困难，一定要好好学习。后来，我们下乡劳动，在乡下，看到了农村人民公社，看到公社社员们的冲天干劲，看到公社里老年人在敬老院，小孩在托儿所，他们生活得那样幸福，使我联想到过去西藏人民的悲惨生活，我觉得公社化也是西藏人民将来应该走的道路。
    这次我参加文代大会，使我特别明确了文艺必须为工农兵服务、怎样为工农兵服务，和文艺工作者必须进行思想改造的问题。我必须刻苦地学习：学习毛泽东著作，学习业务，提高自己的政治水平、音乐水平。我虽然是劳动人民出身，可是，我还是需要多下工厂，下农村，参加劳动，和劳动人民同生活共甘苦，只有这样，才能很好执行党的文艺方针，更好地为工农兵服务。
    这次参加文代会，毛主席和中央负责同志，又接见了全体代表，使我感到无比的幸福。党对我的培养、教育和关怀，我永远不会忘记，我要永远跟着党走，听党的话，党要我做什么我就做什么，为人民、为革命贡献我的一切。
        东方的太阳升起来了，
        毛主席的光芒照四方，
        照得西藏人民得解放，
        照得我们心里亮堂堂。
