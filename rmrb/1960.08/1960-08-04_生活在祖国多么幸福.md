From the Audience:

    How Happy it is to Live in the Motherland
    The New Film Studio's documentary "Returning to the Embrace of the Motherland" is a moving film with profound ideological content. It clearly and deeply records the real situation of overseas Chinese after the anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents in Indonesia, and provides a true and general depiction of the good life of the first group of returned overseas Chinese. At a time when powerful groups in Indonesia are continuing to carry out large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, intensifying the persecution and even massacre of our compatriots, re-screening this film has profound practical significance. It once again provides us with a profound education in patriotism.
    The founding of New China has fundamentally changed the status of overseas Chinese. The era in which overseas Chinese were humiliated and bullied for a long time is gone forever. Overseas Chinese are no longer "orphans," they have a truly strong motherland. A strong motherland is the most powerful backing for overseas Chinese. Look, after the anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents in Indonesia, how thoroughly the government and people of the motherland cared about the lives and situation of overseas Chinese, and even sent ships to foreign countries to welcome persecuted and voluntary returning overseas Chinese. This is an unprecedented initiative in our history! Just imagine, when and which government has ever cared so much about the fate of our overseas Chinese and considered them so thoughtfully? What does this illustrate? It is not difficult to imagine that without the great Chinese Communist Party leading the people of the whole country to overthrow the reactionary rule and establish New China, all of the above would have been completely impossible.
    The motherland is truly strong, and the overseas "orphans" have a mother. The film fully and powerfully demonstrates this point. As a young overseas Chinese student who returned from Indonesia, after watching this film, I felt particularly warm and an indescribable sense of joy and happiness in my heart. I deeply felt the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, and I was even more determined to study and work hard, and to exert all my strength in the motherland's leap forward, which is progressing at a rapid pace, and to be a red youth of the Mao Zedong era.

    生活在祖国多么幸福
    新影厂纪录片《回到祖国怀抱》是一部动人心魄的，具有深刻的思想内容的影片。它明晰而深刻地纪录了印度尼西亚反华排华事件发生后华侨的真实处境，对第一批归国华侨所过的美好生活，作了真实的而概括的描绘。目前正当印度尼西亚有势力集团继续进行大规模的反华排华活动，加紧迫害甚至屠杀我同胞的时候，再度放映这部影片是具有深刻的现实意义的。它再次地给予了我们深刻的爱国主义的教育。
    新中国的成立使海外华侨的地位发生了根本的变化，华侨长期以来被人凌辱和欺负的时代已经一去不复返了。华侨不再是“孤儿”了，他们有了真正强大的祖国。强大的祖国是华侨最有力的靠山。看吧，在印度尼西亚发生反华排华事件后，祖国政府和人民是如何深彻地关怀华侨的生活和处境，甚至派遣船只到国外迎接被迫害和自愿归国的华侨。这是我国历史上的创举！试想，在什么时候，有哪一个政府这样关怀过我们华侨的命运，为华侨设想得这样周到？这说明什么问题呢？不难设想，如果没有伟大的中国共产党领导全国人民推翻反动统治，建立了新中国，上述一切是完全不可能实现的。
    祖国真正的强大了，海外“孤儿”有了娘，影片充分有力地显示了这一点。作为一个印度尼西亚归国华侨青年，观看这部影片后，心坎里特别感到温暖和一种无可言喻的愉快和幸福之感，深深地感到祖国的伟大和可爱，也更加坚强了我要努力学习和工作，在祖国的一日千里的跃进中，发挥我全部力量的信心和决心，立志要做一个毛泽东时代的红色青年。
