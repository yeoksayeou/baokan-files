    Glorious Mission, Glorious People	By our reporter Qu Yifan
    The State-owned General Machinery Factory in Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei, is a red banner in the entire region for industry supporting agriculture. Every day and every month, large quantities of new-style farm tools and agricultural machinery are produced from this factory and continuously transported to rural areas. Sending new products from the factory is only the first step in industrial support for agriculture. How can these new farm tools and machinery be quickly put into production after they arrive in rural areas, and how can farmers be helped to quickly master the installation, repair, and use techniques? Also, how can we understand the new requirements that farmers in various regions put forward to industry at each period? In order to properly solve this series of problems, further strengthen the close ties between factories and rural areas, and between workers and farmers, and to make this relationship regular and systematic, the General Machinery Factory has specially established a rural investigation and research group, headed by Jin Fengshan, a national model worker in industry. He faithfully carries out this glorious mission day after day, year after year.
      The "Eyes" of the Factory
    Communist Party member Jin Fengshan is an old worker in his forties with more than twenty years of experience. He loves the countryside and new farm implements. From the day he entered the General Machinery Factory (formerly known as Xinguang Iron Factory) in the summer of 1954, he has traveled tirelessly to rural areas year after year, his footprints covering more than a dozen counties in Xiangyang, Jingzhou, Yidu, and Huanggang in Hubei Province. He has even traveled to ethnic minority areas in Yunnan Province to repair and investigate cotton gins produced by the factory. Wherever he goes, he quickly blends in with the local farmers, enthusiastically publicizing the significance of industrial support for agriculture, carefully repairing new farm tools and teaching the techniques of use, and conscientiously bringing the new requirements of the farmer brothers back to the factory to improve work. According to incomplete statistics from the past seven years, he has gone to the countryside as many as sixty or seventy times.
    One winter, the factory sent Jin Fengshan to Huopai Township in Xiangyang County. At that time, the farmers were busy cutting and drying sweet potato slices and weeding wheat, digging pond mud, and other tasks. As soon as he arrived in the countryside, he worked with the masses, working and talking with them. At that time, the masses asked him kindly: Can a machine be used to cut sweet potato slices? Can weeding tools be improved? When will we be able to put down the carrying pole for carrying pond mud? Jin Fengshan brought these urgent demands of the farmer brothers back to the factory and reported them to the Party committee. Soon, Jin Fengshan took the lead in the research and trial production of the slicing machine. After more than twenty days of hard work and drilling, a slicing machine that could increase work efficiency more than twenty times compared to manual slicing was born. The three-tooth cultivator produced by this factory had a very good effect on weeding wheat, and the farmers loved to use it. However, when Jin Fengshan went to the countryside, the masses reflected two opinions to him: one was that the quantity was small, and they requested the factory to produce it in large quantities; the other was that there were no parts for repair when it was damaged, and they requested the factory to manufacture a batch of three-tooth cultivator parts. At that time, under the circumstances that the factory's production tasks were very tight and raw materials were very scarce, it still firmly accepted the farmers' requirements, expanding the cultivator production plan on the one hand, and rushing to produce more than 8,000 sets of cultivator parts overnight on the other hand, supplying them to the rural areas in a timely manner.
    Jin Fengshan often brings back various demands from the peasant masses from various rural areas. According to the demands of the peasants and the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, the factory Party committee ensures that the factory's production always has a clear goal: to better serve agricultural production. Whether in the factory or in the countryside, Jin Fengshan is always thinking about tool reform at any time and any place. He often ponders and drills hard for the new requirements put forward by the farmers, forgetting to eat and sleep, until he has done this thing well. In the past few years, he has created and improved 27 kinds of new farm tools such as deep plows, seeders, and slicers, most of which have become famous brands and are included in the annual production plan for mass production and guaranteed supply.
    Good at Being a Student, Being a Good Teacher
    Humbly asking the peasants for advice, and wholeheartedly teaching his skills to the peasants, this is the consistent style of Jin Fengshan and the rural investigation and research group he leads. Before 1956, double-wheel double-share plows were still not popular in many rural areas. The repair workers sent to the countryside by the factory and the production materials salesmen of the supply and marketing cooperatives often racked their brains over this matter and were criticized by some of the masses. Once, Jin Fengshan went to Guanghua County to repair double-share plows. A production team leader said bluntly: "Quickly take back those 'hanging plows' of yours!" (At that time, because the masses did not know how to use them, the double-share plows they bought were hung in the house and not used, hence the name 'hanging plows'). Lao Jin smiled and said, "Don't get angry! I am here to repair the plow." The team leader said unceremoniously: "So many people have come to repair them and none have repaired them well, just you..." "If I can't repair it, I'll carry it back home." The two sides finally agreed, and the owner put out all seven double-share plows. This thing was too heavy, and even two oxen couldn't pull it. Lao Jin looked at it for a long time, tapping here and measuring there, but couldn't find the problem, and couldn't help but feel a little flustered. At this time, a crowd of people had gathered around to watch the excitement, all talking at once, wanting to see what was going on. Lao Jin looked up and saw an old man with a white beard standing in front of him with a smile. Lao Jin had an idea and asked, "Uncle, how do you repair a wooden plow if it's too heavy?" The old man said eloquently: "'An inch deep, enough for one turn,' if the plow tip is installed too steeply, the ox won't be able to pull it. I have used oxen for decades. If the plow is too heavy, I take out the wedge at the bottom and add it to the top, and it immediately becomes lighter. But I don't know what the trick is for this 'foreign plow'?" Lao Jin turned his head and asked the team leader: "Are all seven of your double-share plows the same weight?" The team leader pointed out: "No, this one is the heaviest, and that one is lighter." Lao Jin carefully compared these two plows one by one and found that the tip of the front plow of the heavier one was too flat, and the tip of the rear plow was too steep, and the angles of the front and rear plowshares were inconsistent. Based on the experience of the old man, he carefully adjusted the front and rear plowshares. He hitched the oxen for a trial run on the spot, and the effect was very good. The commune members praised him one after another, and someone raised his thumb and said: "The worker elder brother still has the eye, and the plow was transformed as soon as he started."
    Through constantly asking the masses for advice and constantly exploring from his own practice, Jin Fengshan gradually became the "doctor" of double-share plows and other new plows. He is good at adjusting the new plows to be more useful and more convenient according to different soil types, different terrains, and different pulling forces (the size of the draught animals) in various places. Any problem is "cured as soon as he touches it." In addition to providing these experiences to the factory for research and improving product quality, he also recognizes that the promotion of any new type of agricultural tool must be closely combined with the teaching of technology, so that the broad masses of farmers can master this new technology, guarantee that they can use and repair it, which will be of great benefit to tool reform and agricultural production. Therefore, wherever Jin Fengshan goes, he actively completes the tasks of repair, promotion, and investigation and research assigned by the factory; on the one hand, he responds to requests and gives lectures to new agricultural tool operators and technician training classes held in various places, and personally takes apprentices, imparting techniques wholeheartedly. In the past six years, Jin Fengshan has trained at least seven or eight thousand new agricultural tool operators and rural technicians in rural areas.
    The General Machinery Factory often receives letters from agricultural agencies, supply and marketing departments, and the broad masses of farmers in various places, praising Jin Fengshan's model deeds of taking the lead in doing everything in the countryside, sharing labor and hardship with the peasants, making friends sincerely, and serving agriculture tirelessly. Every time he is praised, Lao Jin always says excitedly: "Without the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses, what ability do I have as an individual, and what achievements can I make?"
    Focus on "Doing," Put "Public" First
    Many people who are familiar with Jin Fengshan praise him as the "Ma Xueli" in local industry. In the face of difficulties, he advocates "focusing on 'doing'" and opposes "focusing on 'difficulty'"; when there is a contradiction between public and private interests, he insists on "putting 'public' first" and does not care about personal gains or losses.
    In the summer of 1958, the factory sent Jin Fengshan to Yunxi County, a large mountainous area in northwestern Hubei. Since liberation, this county has bought one or two hundred double-share plows, but they have never been used because of the narrow mountainous land. Based on the characteristics of the mountainous area, he researched and modified the new plow, and quickly revived all the double-share plows. After the task was completed, Sun Longzhang, the first secretary of the Yunxi County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally went to Jin Fengshan to thank him, saying: "Master Jin has revived the dead plows that have been around for many years, and helped us overcome great difficulties." He also requested: "Our mountainous area is very backward in technology. This autumn, the county plans to universally promote strip planting, but we can't find a strip planter suitable for mountainous areas. Can you stay and help us come up with a design?" Lao Jin felt that the problem raised by Secretary Sun was indeed a major issue for increasing agricultural production in mountainous areas, so he happily agreed. However, he found that the county farm tool factory in this mountainous area had very poor conditions, with no sand-turning equipment or lathes, and the parts required for the strip planter could not be manufactured. Therefore, with the strong support of the county Party committee, he explored and tried to produce a strip planter suitable for mountainous areas while actively assisting the farm tool factory workers to engage in technological innovation. At this time, Jin Fengshan suddenly received a letter from the factory leaders urging him to return to the factory, saying that his lover was seriously ill and had been sent to the hospital for surgery, and hoping that he would come back to take care of her. Jin Fengshan had a difficult life when he was young, and he did not get married until he was in his forties, so he was very anxious. But he changed his mind: No! If I leave like this, it will affect production in the mountainous area. He asked himself: "Could it be that a soldier fighting on the battlefield can withdraw from the front line if he hears that his family is sick?" He persisted and finally made three types of automatically adjustable strip planters suitable for different characteristics of mountainous areas. This type of strip planter was soon mass-produced by the county farm tool factory and supplied to rural areas in mountainous areas. Jin Fengshan's lofty style greatly moved the cadres and masses in the mountainous areas of Yunxi. When he left, the county Party secretary, the county magistrate, and many people came to see him off, overflowing with the deep friendship between workers and peasants.

    光荣的使命  光荣的人	本报记者　曲一凡
    湖北襄阳专区国营通用机械厂，是全区工业支援农业的一面红旗。每日每月，从这个厂里生产出大批的新式农具和农业机械，源源运往各地农村。新产品从工厂送走，仅是工业支援农业的第一步。如何使这些新农具和机械到达农村之后很快投入到生产中去，帮助农民迅速地掌握安装、修配和使用技术；又如何了解每个时期各地农民对工业提出的新要求？为了妥善解决这一系列的问题，进一步加强工厂与农村、工人与农民之间的密切联系，并使之经常化和制度化，通用机械厂专门设立了一个农村调查研究组，由全国工业劳动模范金凤山担任组长，他数年如一日忠实地执行着这个光荣的使命。
      工厂的“眼睛”
    共产党员金凤山，是个四十多岁、有二十多年工龄的老工人。他热爱农村，也热爱新农具。他由1954年夏季进入通用机械厂（原名新光铁工厂）那天起，就成年累月不辞辛苦地奔走于各地农村，足迹遍及湖北省襄阳、荆州、宜都、黄冈等地的十几个县，还曾经为修配和调查本厂出品的轧花机，远途跋涉到过云南省的兄弟民族地区。不论走到哪里，他很快就能和当地农民打成一片，热情宣传工业支援农业的意义，细心地为农村修配新农具和传授使用技术，并且认真地把农民弟兄的新要求带回厂里以改进工作。据近七年来不完全统计，他先后下乡有六、七十次之多。
    一个冬天，厂里派金凤山到襄阳县伙牌乡去。当时农民正忙着切晒红苕（即甘薯）片和锄麦草、挖塘泥等活路。他一到农村就和群众一起干活，边劳动边谈心。当时，群众亲切地问他：切苕片能不能用机器？锄草工具能不能改良？挑塘泥几时能放下扁担？金凤山带着农民弟兄的这些迫切要求回到工厂，向党委作了汇报。不久，金凤山带头投入了切片机的研究试制工作，经过二十多天的勤试苦钻，一种可比人工切片提高工效二十多倍的切片机诞生了。这个厂造的三齿耘锄锄麦效果很好，农民很爱用。但在金凤山下乡时，群众向他反映了两点意见：一是数量少，要求工厂大量生产；二是用坏了没零件修配，要求工厂专造一批三齿耘锄零件。当时工厂在生产任务十分紧张和原材料很缺乏的情况下，仍然坚定地接受了农民的要求，一面扩大了耘锄生产计划，一面连夜赶制出八千多套耘锄的零件，及时供应了农村。
    金凤山经常从各地农村带回农民群众这样或那样的要求，厂党委根据农民的要求和上级党委的指示，使工厂的生产始终有一个明确的目标：更好地服务于农业生产。金凤山不论在厂里或到农村，随时随地都在打工具改革的主意。他经常为了农民提出的新要求苦思硬钻，废寝忘餐，直到把这件事儿办好。几年来经他创制和改良的深耕犁、条播器、切片机等新式农具达二十七种，其中大多成为名牌货，列入常年生产计划，成批生产，保证供应。
    善做学生　当好先生
    虚心向农民请教，而又尽心地把自己的技术教给农民，这是金凤山和他领导的农村调查研究组的一贯作风。1956年以前，双轮双铧犁在许多农村还吃不开，工厂派下乡的修配工人和供销社的生产资料推销员，经常为这件事大伤脑筋，受到部分群众责难。有一次金凤山到光化县修配双铧犁，一个生产队长直截了当地说：“快把你们那些‘挂犁’（当时因为群众不会使用，买来的双铧犁挂在屋里不用，因有‘挂犁’之名）背回去吧！”老金笑着说：“别动肝火！我就是专门修犁来的。”队长不客气地说：“多少人来修都没修好，就你……”“我若修不好，再把它背回家去。”双方终于说好，主人把七部双铧犁全摆出来，这玩艺儿太重，两只牛都拉不动。老金端详了好久，东敲敲、西量量，找不出毛病，心里不免有些发慌。这时，周围已经围上一堆看热闹的群众，大伙儿七言八语，要想看个究竟。老金抬头一望，一位白胡子老汉笑眯眯站在跟前。老金灵机一动，就问：“老大伯，木犁重了咋修理？”老汉如数家珍地说：“‘凹一寸，够一犇’，如果犁尖装陡了，牛就拉不动。我使了几十年的牛，犁重了就把下部的楔子抽出来加在上部，立刻轻爽多了。可不晓得这‘洋犁’的窍门在哪儿？”老金转头又问队长：“你们七部双铧犁都一样轻重吗？”队长指点说：“不，就数这一部最重，那一部较轻。”老金又仔细地把这两部犁逐一比较，果然发现重的一部前犁尖太平，后犁尖太陡，前后两只犁铧的角度不一致。他便根据老汉的经验谈，仔细把前后犁铧重作了调整，当场套牛试用，效果很好。社员个个称赞，有人翘起大姆指说：“还是工人老大哥有板眼，一动手就把犁改造好了。”
    通过不断地向群众请教，和不断地从自己的实践中摸索，金凤山逐渐变成了双铧犁及其他新犁的“医生”。他善于根据各地不同土质、不同地形和不同的拉力（耕畜的大小），把新式犁调整得更好用，更轻便。任何毛病到他手里“手到病除”。他除了把这些经验提供厂里研究，改进产品质量以外，还认识到任何一件新式农具推广起来，必须与传授技术紧密结合，使广大农民都能掌握这套新技术，保证会用会修，这样对于工具改革和对农业生产才大有益处。因此，金凤山每到一个地方，一面积极完成厂里交给的修配、推广和调查研究的任务；一面有求必应地为各地举办的新农具手和技术员训练班讲课，现场带徒弟，尽心尽意传授技术。六年以来，金凤山在各地农村先后训练的新农具手和农村技术员至少有七、八千人。
    通用机械厂经常接到各地农业机关、供销部门和广大农民的来信，表扬金凤山在农村事事带头干，和农民同劳动共甘苦，真心实意交朋友，不辞劳苦地为农业服务的模范事迹。每一次表扬，老金总是激动地说：“没有党的领导和群众的支持，我个人有啥本事，能做出啥成绩？”
    干字当头　公字当先
    许多熟悉金凤山的人都称赞说：“金凤山是地方工业中的‘马学礼’”。在困难面前，他主张“干字当头”，反对“难字当头”；在公私利益矛盾的时候，他坚持“公字当先”，不计较个人得失。
    1958年夏天，工厂派金凤山到鄂西北大山区郧西县去。这个县自解放以来先后买了一两百部双铧犁，因高山地窄始终没有使用过。他根据山区的特点，研究改装了新犁，很快就使双铧犁全部复活了。任务完成了，中共郧西县委第一书记孙龙章亲自找金凤山致谢，说：“金师傅把多年的死犁给医活了，帮我们克服了好大的困难。”又要求说：“我们这山区技术很落后，今年秋种全县计划普遍推广条播，可就是找不到适合山区用的条播器。你能不能留下帮我们出个样子？”老金觉得孙书记提出的这个问题确是山区农业增产的大事，就高兴地答应下来。但他发现这个山区的县农具厂条件很差，翻砂设备和车床等一概没有，条播器所需零件不能造。于是他就在县委大力支持下，一面摸索试制适合山区的条播器，一面积极协助农具厂职工大闹技术革新。这时候，金凤山忽然接到本厂领导的来信，催他回厂，说他的爱人生了重病，已被送进医院开刀，盼他回来照顾。金凤山因为年青时生活贫困，直到四十多岁才结婚，心中十分焦虑。可他转念一想：不行！我这样撒手走了，就会影响山区生产。他问自己：“难道在战场上打仗的战士听到家里人病了，就可以退下火线不打了吗？”他坚持下去，终于做成三种适合山区不同特点的自动调节的条播器。这种条播器不久便由县农具厂大批生产，供应山区农村。金凤山这种崇高风格，使郧西山区干部和群众大受感动。临别时，县委书记、县长和许多群众亲来相送，洋溢着工农之间的深情厚谊。
