    Coconut Bowl
    Gu Gong fought in the coconut groves, slept in the coconut groves, the soldiers of the Qiongya Column, their footprints densely covering Hainan.
    Picking abundant coconuts, carving them into round rice bowls, drinking clear spring water when thirsty, eating wild vegetables when hungry.
    Carrying guns, fighting north and south, traversing the heat and cold; the once-rampant bandits, covering the stinking beaches.
    Every victory night, singing and dancing in jubilation; the coconut bowl filled with coconut wine, welcoming ten thousand miles of clear sky.

    椰子碗
    顾工在椰林中作战，在椰林中睡眠，琼崖纵队的战士，脚印密布海南。采下累累椰果，雕成圆圆饭碗，渴时勺饮清泉，饥时野菜就餐。持枪南北转战，穿越暑热风寒；疯狂一时的贼寇，盖满发腥的海滩。每逢胜利夜晚，高歌载舞狂欢；椰碗盛满椰酒，迎来万里晴天。
