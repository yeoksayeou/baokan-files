Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 18th: A grand gathering was held by people from all walks of life in Wuhan at the Wuhan Theater tonight to warmly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    Zhang Tixue, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Governor of Hubei Province, Liu Yangqiao and Xu Daoqi, Secretaries of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the CCP, Meng Futang, Deputy Governor of Hubei Province, Min Xuesheng, Head of the Leadership Organ of the Wuhan Garrison, Li Erzhong and Song Yiping, Secretaries of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CCP, and Xiong Fei, Deputy Mayor of Wuhan, all attended the meeting.

    The entire delegation of the China-Korea Friendship Association, headed by Kim Jong-heng, also attended the celebration.

    Zhang Tixue spoke first at the meeting. He warmly praised the glorious victory of the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, in defeating the aggression of U.S. imperialism with unparalleled heroism, and the great achievements of the Korean people in the cause of rebuilding their motherland after the war. He emphasized that the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism will never change. U.S. imperialism is openly clamoring to subvert socialist countries and intensifying its suppression and sabotage of the national liberation movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It still occupies South Korea, has never given up obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, constantly violates the Korean Armistice Agreement, and frantically carries out war provocations. However, all the war conspiracies and provocations of U.S. imperialism are doomed to fail. He concluded by saying that the people of China and Korea have forged a deep friendship cemented with blood in the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism. Now, this friendship is being continuously strengthened and developed in the socialist construction of the two peoples.

    Then, Kim Jong-heng spoke amidst warm applause. He said that the Korean people are victoriously carrying out socialist construction, completing the first five-year plan two and a half years ahead of schedule. Now, the Korean people have put forward the seven-year plan starting from 1961. He said that the great achievements made by the people of Korea and China have made great contributions to strengthening the power of the socialist camp and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world.

    He said that the chieftain of imperialism—U.S. imperialism—is unwilling to learn a lesson from the disastrous defeat in the Korean War. The Korean people will continue to wage a tenacious struggle until they drive U.S. imperialism out of South Korea and realize the Korean people’s desire for peaceful reunification of their motherland. The Korean people are deeply convinced that the Chinese people will certainly be able to drive U.S. imperialism out of Taiwan and liberate their own territory of Taiwan. His speech was repeatedly interrupted by stormy applause.

    More than a thousand people attended today's meeting.

    朝中友好协会代表团全体贵宾出席了大会
    新华社武汉18日电　武汉市各界人民今晚在武汉剧院举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国解放十五周年。
    中共湖北省委书记处书记、湖北省省长张体学，中共湖北省委书记处书记刘仰峤、许道琦，湖北省副省长孟夫唐，武汉驻军领导机关负责人闵学胜，中共武汉市委书记处书记李尔重、宋一平，武汉市副市长熊飞等都出席了大会。
    以金钟恒团长为首的朝中友好协会代表团全体贵宾也出席了庆祝大会。
    张体学首先在会上讲话。他热情赞扬了朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，以无比的英雄气概打败了美帝国主义侵略的辉煌胜利，以及战后朝鲜人民在重建自己祖国的事业中的伟大成就。他强调指出，美帝国主义的侵略本质是永远不会改变的。美帝国主义正在公开叫嚣要颠覆社会主义国家，加紧镇压和破坏亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的民族解放运动。它至今还侵占着南朝鲜，始终没有放弃阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，不断地破坏朝鲜停战协定，疯狂地进行战争挑衅。但是，美帝国主义的一切战争阴谋和挑衅是注定要失败的。他最后说，中朝两国人民在反对共同的敌人美帝国主义中，用鲜血凝结成了深厚的友谊，现在，这种友谊又在两国人民的社会主义建设事业中，不断地加强和发展。
    接着，金钟恒团长在热烈的掌声中讲话。他说：朝鲜人民正在胜利地进行着社会主义建设，提前两年半完成了第一个五年计划，现在，朝鲜人民又提出了从1961年起的七年计划。他说：朝中两国人民取得的巨大成就，对于加强社会主义阵营的威力，维护远东和世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。
    他说：帝国主义的魁首——美帝国主义不肯从朝鲜战争的惨败中吸取教训，朝鲜人民将继续展开顽强的斗争，直到把美帝国主义赶出南朝鲜，实现朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的愿望。朝鲜人民深信：中国人民一定能从台湾赶走美帝国主义，解放自己的领土台湾。他的讲话不断为暴风雨般的掌声所打断。
    出席今天大会的有一千多人。
