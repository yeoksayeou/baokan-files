    Unified Leadership and Management · Formulating This Year's Plan
    National People's Telecommunications Conference Opens

    The National People's Telecommunications Conference, convened by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government, opened in Beijing on the 25th. More than 80 representatives from the administrative and trade union aspects of telecommunications bureaus in major administrative regions across the country attended. The conference will discuss the unified leadership and management of the national people's telecommunications undertaking and formulate a recovery and construction plan for 1950.

    At today's meeting, Zhu Xuefan, Minister of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, made a report. He said that the people's telecommunications undertaking, starting from only one military radio receiver, has, through long-term arduous efforts, now mastered the national telecommunications network. During the Liberation War, although the Kuomintang reactionaries planned and massively destroyed telecommunications equipment in various places, thanks to the protection of local employees before liberation and the active repairs after liberation, more than 1,200 telecommunications bureaus across the country and 80 percent of the national telegraph and telephone lines have now been restored.

    Regarding the future direction of the people's telecommunications undertaking's recovery and construction, Minister Zhu said that the people's telecommunications undertaking must serve national defense construction, the implementation of government orders, economic recovery and development, and the dissemination of culture. In order to unify the leadership of the national telecommunications undertaking, unified management must be implemented in terms of organization, finance, personnel, and material allocation in the future. At present, due to the shift of the national political and economic center of gravity to the north, the recovery and construction work of the telecommunications undertaking and the allocation of personnel in 1950 must adapt to this situation.

    At the meeting, Wang Zheng, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, made a supplementary report on unified leadership and management and this year's recovery and construction plan.

    统一领导管理·制订今年计划
    全国人民电信会议开幕
    【新华社北京二十五日电】中央人民政府邮电部召开的全国人民电信会议，已于二十五日在京开幕。出席者有全国各大行政区电信局行政方面与工会方面的代表八十余人。会议将讨论全国人民电信事业的统一领导管理问题，及订出一九五○年的恢复和建设计划。
    在今日的会议上，邮电部朱学范部长作了报告，他说：人民电信事业从最初仅有一架军用收报机起，经过长期艰苦的努力，至今已掌握了全国的电信网。在解放战争中，国民党反动派虽曾作有计划地大肆破坏各地电信设备，但由于各地职工在解放前的保护，与解放后的积极抢修，现已恢复了全国一千二百多个电信局和全国电报、电话线路的百分之八十。
    关于今后人民电信事业恢复和建设的方针，朱部长说：人民电信事业必须为国防建设、政令的贯彻、经济的恢复与发展、文化的传播而服务。为了统一全国电信事业的领导，今后必须在组织上、财务上、人事上、与器材调拨上实行统一管理。目前由于全国政治经济的重心已转移到北方，一九五○年电信事业的恢复建设工作以及人员的配置，必须适应这一情况。
    会上，邮电部王诤副部长作了关于统一领导管理和今年恢复和建设计划的补充报告。
