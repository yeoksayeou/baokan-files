    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Youth League Committee of the Shijiazhuang Office of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau recently issued instructions to its subordinate units, calling on the Youth League leadership of each factory and section to, according to the specific circumstances of each factory and section, improve the technical level of young workers, pay attention to improving teacher-student relations, and universally launch a respect-teachers-love-apprentices movement.  All general branches and branches must take the initiative to establish close contact with the Party, government, and labor union, and seize the time to carry out this movement in conjunction with the current central work.  Before launching the respect-teachers-love-apprentices movement, widespread and in-depth propaganda should be carried out to break down various ideological concerns among teachers and apprentices.  After ideologies are clarified and correct teacher-student relationships are established, teachers and apprentices should be further mobilized to make plans and sign contracts, with teachers and apprentices making mutual guarantees.  Then, the teacher-student teaching contract should be announced publicly at a mass meeting so that the masses can supervise its implementation.  In the course of the movement, in order to encourage and stimulate teaching enthusiasm, a unified system of regular strict tests, as well as rewards, criticisms, and promotions, should be formulated.  Regarding teacher-student groups, the leadership should also establish a system of regular meeting reports, and pay attention to mobilizing competition between groups and individuals, as well as a movement to win red flags.  After a period of time, a comprehensive test should be conducted strictly in connection with actual work. After the test, a mass-based evaluation of merits and demerits should be carried out. According to the evaluation results, those who have contributed to teaching should be commended and rewarded or promoted; those who have made mistakes or failed should be given appropriate criticism or an extension of study time.
