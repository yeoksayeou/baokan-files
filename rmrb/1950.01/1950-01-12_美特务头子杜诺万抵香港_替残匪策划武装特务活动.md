Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 11th: According to Hong Kong sources, William "Wild Bill" Donovan, who served as the head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) of the U.S. Army during World War II, arrived in Hong Kong from the United States on the 2nd of this month to plot armed espionage activities in the liberated areas for the Kuomintang bandit gang. Donovan's trip to Hong Kong is ostensibly to oversee Chennault's efforts to seize the property rights of the Central and China Airlines, which have long belonged to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. However, according to a dispatch from the Associated Press in San Francisco on the 8th, citing columnist Pearson's broadcast, Donovan is in Hong Kong discussing a secret agreement to lead the Kuomintang bandit gang in a "anti-communist guerrilla war" on the Chinese mainland. As early as December 1st, Agence France-Presse Hong Kong cited "Taipei semi-official sources" as saying that Chiang Kai-shek's confidant and intelligence chief Mao Sen revealed in a speech on the 1st that a "friendly nation" was supporting his "guerrilla forces" with communication equipment. The "friendly nation" Mao Sen was referring to is the United States.

    替残匪策划武装特务活动
    【新华社北京十一日电】据香港消息，曾于第二次世界大战时担任美国陆军战略情报处处长的杜诺万已于本月二日由美国飞抵香港，为国民党匪帮策划在解放区的武装特务活动。杜诺万此次到港表面上是为了负责指导陈纳德争夺早已属于中华人民共和国中央人民政府所有的中央、中国两航空公司的产权的活动。但实际上，据美联社旧金山八日电引美专栏作家皮尔逊的广播说：杜诺万在香港正讨论一项密约，以领导国民党匪帮在中国大陆上的“反共游击战”。按早在十二月一日，法新社香港电即曾引证《台北半官方消息》说，蒋介石亲信特务头子毛森在一日谈话中透露“友邦”以通讯装备支持了他的“游击队”。毛森所说的“友邦”就是指的美国。
