Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 31st: TASS, Moscow, December 29th: Mayevsky wrote in Pravda: The trial of former Japanese army servicemen in Khabarovsk revealed a shocking picture of the crimes committed by Japanese militarists. The prosecution material, supplemented by the defendants' confessions, has irrefutably proven that the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters, under the secret orders of Emperor Hirohito and the Japanese General Staff, directed the preparation and conduct of bacteriological warfare. Under the direction of General Umezu, the former commander-in-chief of the Kwantung Army, and his successor, defendant Yamada, bacteriological killing factories equipped with the latest equipment launched intense activities in Manchuria. This extremely secret unit, established under the order of Emperor Hirohito, intensified the preparation of tools for destroying millions of people. This preparation work received top priority under the special concern of the Japanese Minister of the Army, and later Prime Minister, Tojo. The Japanese government spared no expense on the "scientific research work" of these modern man-eating savages.

Mayevsky pointed out that the main task of the Japanese militarists was to prepare for the widespread use of bacteriological weapons against the Soviet Union. The work of preparing for war (including bacteriological warfare) never stopped for a day. In May 1945, the activities of the bacteriological killing factories were particularly intensified. Ishii, the head of Unit 731, told his subordinates: "There may be a need to launch a bacteriological attack on the enemy any day." Defendants Yamada and Tang Ze both admitted that bacteriological attacks were not only planned to be launched against the Soviet Union, China, and Mongolia, but also against the United States and Britain. However, these plans of the Japanese militarists have been shattered by the Soviet army, which swept away the million-strong Kwantung Army in Japan. The Japanese invaders harbored plans to establish a world empire and large-scale aggressive wars. These plans stipulated that the Japanese militarists should seize the Far Eastern part of the Soviet Union, China, Manchuria, Korea, and the Nanyang countries.

    The American imperialists used Japanese war criminals to persecute democratic forces and launch anti-Soviet movements.

The author continued that after defeating Japanese imperialism in World War II, the main task was to disarm Japan and eliminate the preconditions for the revival of Japanese militarism and the resurgence of aggression, in order to build Japan into a peace-loving and democratic country. The Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945, has precisely defined these tasks. After the passage of the Potsdam Declaration, the United States used every means to undermine its implementation. From the very beginning of the occupation of Japan, the United States has put people who belong to the same camp as these war criminals currently on trial in Khabarovsk in power. The offensive of the Japanese and American reactionaries against the Japanese working class, democratic parties and groups is intensifying day by day. The close connection between the monopoly capital of Japan and the United States is an indisputable fact. This connection aims to facilitate Japan's rapid rearmament and turn Japan into the main springboard for the United States in the Far East. The American occupation authorities and the Japanese ruling group headed by Yoshida are trying to incite revanchist sentiments among the people, launch a frenzied anti-Soviet movement, and encourage Japanese militarists to make rude demands on Soviet territory.

    The United States has bacteriological weapons experimental stations near Washington.

Mayevsky emphasized that the organizers and advocates of the aggressive plan have come out to defend the murderers currently on trial in Khabarovsk. According to the United Press, an official representative of MacArthur's headquarters said that the headquarters' chemical department had conducted "a thorough investigation" and "found nothing to indicate that the Japanese had used bacteriological weapons." To this end, Mayevsky wrote that as early as February 1948, the Washington Post reported that there was an experimental station for studying bacteriological weapons very close to the American capital. In the fall of 1947, two years after the end of World War II, a test site was allocated to this experimental station to conduct experiments on spreading infectious diseases from aircraft. Former US Secretary of the Army Forrestal said, when he was still lucid, that continued research was necessary so that the United States might use bacteriological weapons in the future. Mayevsky declared that this is why the Khabarovsk trial is not just a trial of this group of Japanese war criminals - the product of the fascist regime. This is a trial of all the dark forces preparing for new crimes against humanity. This is a warning to the supporters of peace and progress around the world: be vigilant! The bandits' new war plans must be crushed.

### 审判日本细菌战犯就是审判一切战贩  真理报发表马耶夫斯基论文

    审判日本细菌战犯就是审判一切战贩
    真理报发表马耶夫斯基论文
    【新华社北京三十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：马耶夫斯基在真理报上写道：在伯力对前日本陆军军人的审讯，暴露出日本军国主义者所犯罪恶的惊人图景。由被告的供词所补充的起诉材料，已经无可辩驳地证明：日本关东军统帅部是奉裕仁天皇和日本参谋部的密令指导准备与进行细菌战的。在前关东军总司令梅津及其继任者被告山田的指导下，配有最新装备的细菌杀人工厂，在满洲展开了紧张的活动。奉裕仁天皇命令成立的这支极端秘密的部队加紧准备着毁灭千百万人民的工具，这种准备工作在日本陆相，后来又任日本首相东条的特别关心之下，获得了头等的重视。日本政府不惜以巨量金钱用于这种现代吃人生番的“科学研究工作”。
    马耶夫斯基指出，日本军国主义者的主要任务是准备对苏联广泛使用细菌武器。准备战争（包括细菌战）的工作，一天也没有停止过。一九四五年五月，细菌杀人工厂的活动特别加紧起来。七三一部队长石井告诉他的僚属说：“任何一天都可能会有对敌人发动细菌进攻的必要性。”被告山田和唐泽都承认，细菌进攻不只是计划要对苏联、中国和蒙古发动，而且还要对美国和英国发动。但日本军国主义者这些计划，已经被横扫日本百万关东军的苏军所粉碎了。日本侵略者怀着建立世界帝国的计划和大规模侵略战争的计划。这种计划里规定要日本军国主义者夺取苏联的远东部分、中国、满洲、朝鲜和南洋诸国。
            美帝利用日战犯迫害民主力量并发动反苏运动。
    作者继称，在第二次大战中击败日本帝国主义以后，主要任务就是要解除日本武装并消除日本军国主义复活和侵略再起的先决条件，以便将日本建设为一个爱好和平的民主国家。一九四五年七月二十六日的波茨坦宣言，已经精确地规定了这些任务。在通过波茨坦宣言后，美国就用一切办法来破坏其履行。美国从一开始占领日本的时候起，就使与这些目前在伯力受审的战犯们同属一个阵营的人们上台当政。日本和美国反动派对日本工人阶级、民主党派和团体的攻势，正在一天天地猛烈。美国与日本的垄断资本的紧密联系，是不容置辩的事实。这种联系旨在便利日本的迅速重整武装，把日本变为美国在远东的主要跳板。美国占领当局和以吉田为首的日本统治集团，力图在人民中间煽起报复主义情绪，发动疯狂的反苏运动，鼓励日本军国主义者对苏联国土的横蛮要求。
            美国华盛顿附近设有细菌武器实验站。
    马耶夫斯基着重说，侵略计划的组织者和鼓吹者，已出来保卫目前在伯力受审的杀人犯。据合众社称，麦克阿瑟总部的官方代表说，该总部的化学部已经作了“充分的调查”，而且“毫未发现任何东西足以说明日本人使用过细菌武器”。为此，马耶夫斯基写道，早在一九四八年二月，华盛顿邮报报道称，在极靠近美国首都的地方设有研究细菌武器的实验站。一九四七年秋，第二次世界大战结束后两年，有一片试验场被拨给这个试验站，以便进行从飞机散播传染病的试验。前美国陆军部长福莱斯特尔在神志还清明的时候说过，继续研究是必要的，这样美国可能在将来使用细菌武器。马耶夫斯基宣称，这就是为什么伯力审判不仅仅是审判这一群日本战犯——法西斯政权的产物的原故。这是审判一切准备着反对人类的新罪行的黑暗势力。这是警告全世界的和平与进步的支持者：要警惕！必须粉碎匪徒的新战争计划。
