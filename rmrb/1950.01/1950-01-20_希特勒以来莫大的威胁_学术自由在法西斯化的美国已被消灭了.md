“The Greatest Threat Since Hitler”
Academic Freedom Eliminated in Fascist America
Ding Dechun

In June 1949, when Robert Maynard Hutchins, the president of the University of Chicago, was summoned by the reactionary Illinois State Legislature to reveal progressive elements within the school in order to determine punishments for the University of Chicago, President Hutchins solemnly stated: "This kind of high-pressure policy completely violates the letter and spirit of the American Constitution. The pervasiveness of this policy throughout the United States today is truly the greatest threat since Hitler." "The most fashionable thing to do today is to put a red hat on those with whom you disagree. Those who criticize American foreign policy, those who criticize peacetime conscription, those who criticize the Atlantic Pact, and those who oppose expanding the military and wasting national wealth will naturally be considered communists because their views are consistent with the Soviet Union. There are also those who are dissatisfied with the slums all over America, dissatisfied with the cruel discrimination and lynching of black people, and dissatisfied with the Ku Klux Klan, which violates humanity and disregards the law in its massacres of black people; these are also considered to be colluding with foreign countries because the Soviet Union also opposes this barbarity. In short, every American who desires reform and pursues progress is inevitably guilty today. This is the United States, which has always boasted of freedom and democracy to the world.”

In fascist America, universities are not allowed to use progressive textbooks.

In June 1949, the U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee forced more than one hundred well-known universities to submit lists of textbooks used, which were then subjected to extremely strict scrutiny by thirty-five academic executioners hired by the committee. If books with progressive colors were found, not only would they be banned from use, but the teachers and school officials in charge would also bear joint responsibility. Representative Wood, chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee in charge of the matter, said, "We have received reports that many universities have recently adopted pro-Soviet and pro-communist textbooks. Universities are generally controlled by progressive professors, whose words and thoughts not only influence our university students but also influence our middle school and even elementary school students. Overall, they greatly influence our next generation."

Progressive professors are frequently persecuted in fascist America.

Under pressure from the government, university authorities are cracking down on progressive professors. Most of the professors who have been fired are supporters and voters of Wallace's Progressive Party or the Communist Party. The University of Washington was the first to fire three professors as early as the spring of 1949. The school authorities also forced all professors to form a trial committee, insisting that two of the three professors were Communist Party members and one was a sympathizer with communism. Dr. Spitzer, a chemistry professor at Oregon State University, was fired for supporting Soviet Professor Lysenko's genetics. The reactionary president of the university criticized Dr. Spitzer as having "no scientific discernment, no pursuit of truth, because he was bound by Soviet doctrines." Dr. Barker, a professor at Evansville College in Indiana, who supported Wallace's election campaign, was forced to leave his post in April 1949. Under the same charge, English professors Read and Daggett of the University of New Hampshire also lost their jobs. Marshall G., an associate professor of history and Soviet government at Yale University, was no exception. His crime was teaching pro-Soviet content, having served as a Progressive Party congressional candidate, and proposing to invite the famous Soviet composer Shostakovich to perform at Yale. In addition, Professor Flestett of the University of North Carolina, who received a scholarship from the U.S. Atomic Energy Control Commission, was suspected of being pro-communist and lost not only his scholarship but also his teaching position. According to the American Association of University Professors, more than two hundred university professors had been suspended, dismissed, and never rehired under similar charges by the summer of 1949.

In addition, state legislatures have passed many cruel laws to suppress teachers at all levels of schools. For example, Kansas, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania passed laws that allow for the dismissal of progressive teachers who are not "loyal" to the reactionary U.S. government at any time. Maryland, New Jersey, and New York passed laws prohibiting teachers from participating in progressive organizations. Maryland and New York also ordered schools to inspect the words and actions of all teachers at any time.

A further method of oppressing teachers is to force all teachers to swear allegiance. The first to implement this was the University of California. On June 12, 1949, the president of the University of California forced four thousand faculty and staff members to swear an oath. The presidents of the two most famous American universities—Harvard and Columbia, Conant and Eisenhower—also took the lead in issuing a joint declaration of fifty-four pages on June 12, 1949, deciding to eliminate communism and communists from schools.

In the face of the impending demise of monopoly capitalism, the so-called democracy and freedom of fascist America are revealed to be such.

Those individualistic liberals in our country who worship American-style democracy so wholeheartedly should wake up!

    “希特勒以来莫大的威胁”
    学术自由在法西斯化的美国已被消灭了
    丁德纯
    一九四九年六月，美国芝加哥大学校长赫钦斯被反动的伊利诺州州议会传讯，要他供出学校里的进步分子，以决定对芝加哥大学的处分时，赫钦斯校长严正的说：“这种高压政策，完全违背美国宪法的文字与精神。今日这种政策之弥漫全美，诚为希特勒以来莫大之威胁。”“今日最时髦的事便是给你所不同意的人带上一顶红帽子。那些批评美国外交政策的人，批评平时征兵的人，批评大西洋公约的人，以及那些反对扩军浪费国帑的人自然会被认为共产党，因为他们的见解与苏联的见解一致。还有那些不满意于美国遍地的贫民窟，不满意对黑人的残酷歧视与私刑，不满意违反人道目无法纪的屠杀黑人的三Ｋ党，这些也都被认是勾结外国的，因为苏联也反对这种野蛮作风。总之，每一渴望改革追求进步的美国人，今天都不免有罪。这便是素以自由民主夸耀于世界的美国。”
    在法西斯化的美国，大学里是不许采用进步的教科书的。
    美国众院非美活动调查委员会，一九四九年六月强迫一百以上的著名大学开列所用的教科书名单具报，由该会所聘的三十五个学术刽子手予以极严格的审查，如果发现带有进步色彩的书籍，不仅不准再用，教课的先生及学校负责人都有连带责任。主持其事的众院非美活动调查委员会主席众议员伍德说，“我们已接到报告，近来各大学采用亲苏亲共的教本甚多，各大学都为一般进步的教授把持，他们的言论思想，不仅影响我们的大学生，而且影响了我们的中学生甚至小学生，整个地说，大大地影响了我们的下一代。”
    思想进步的教授，在法西斯化的美国，是经常被迫害的。
    各大学当局在政府的压迫下，向进步教授开刀。被开除的教授多半是华莱士进步党或共产党的拥护者和投票者。首先是华盛顿大学，远在一九四九年春季便辞聘三个教授，学校当局并强迫全体教授们组织审判委员会，硬指这三个教授有二个是共产党党员，一个是共产主义的同情者。俄勒岗州州立大学化学教授史培泽博士，因为拥护苏联李森科教授的遗传学被开除了，该大学反动校长并批评史培泽博士为“无科学辨别力，无真理探求力，因为他被苏联的学说束缚了。”拥护华莱士竞选的印地安那州伊凡塞尔大学教授巴克尔博士在一九四九年四月被迫离职了。在同一罪名下，新汉普修州大学英文教授李德傲，大格特两氏也打破了饭碗。耶鲁大学历史学及苏联政府学副教授马沙尔加更不例外，他的罪名是教学亲苏，曾任进步党国会候选人，并曾提议邀请苏联著名作曲家萧斯塔科维奇来耶鲁演奏。此外得美国原子能管制委员会的奖学金的北加罗林那州大学物理学教授佛莱斯德特氏被认有亲共嫌疑，不但丢了奖学金，也丢了教职。在类似的罪名之下，美国被停聘、解聘、并永不再聘用的大学教授们，据美国大学教授联合会的统计，至一九四九年夏天其数已达二百以上。
    除此以外，各州议会更通过了许多残酷的立法，压迫各级学校的教师们。如康萨斯州、麻萨诸塞州、宾夕尔法尼亚州通过可随时开除不“忠”于美国反动政府的进步教师。马利兰州、新泽西州、纽约州通过禁止教师参加进步的组织。马利兰州、纽约州并命令各校随时检查各教师的言论行动。
    更进一步压迫教师的办法，便是强迫所有教师宣誓效忠。首先实行的，便是加利佛尼亚大学。一九四九年六月十二日，加州大学校长强迫四千个教职员宣誓。最著名的两个美国大学——哈佛和哥仑比亚的校长康南和艾森豪威尔也领头于一九四九年六月十二日发表长达五十四页的联合宣言，决定清除共产主义及共产党出学校。
    在独占资本主义濒于灭亡的今天，法西斯化的美国的所谓民主和自由，其真象原来如此。
    我国某些对美国式的民主崇拜得五体投地的个人自由主义者，该醒悟了吧！
