Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd: TASS, Copenhagen dispatch: The resolution passed at the recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the Danish Communist Party was published on the 19th in the Danish Communist Party's organ, "Land and People."

The resolution declares: According to the views in the resolution of the Communist Information Bureau in November 1949, the Central Committee emphasizes that it would be a serious error for Communists and those who uphold peace to conclude that the international situation is no longer so tense, simply because they see that the anti-imperialist peace camp has been consolidated. The more difficult the position of the imperialists, the more they want to plunge the world into a new, devastating war. Denmark is now being rapidly transformed into an outpost for America's anti-Soviet war of aggression. The economic burden caused by Denmark's policies is being shifted to the Danish working people through heavy taxes, currency devaluation, and rising prices. However, as long as broad sections of the people are determined to rise up and defend peace, they can stop the imperialist war policy. Therefore, the Party must eliminate the tendency that exists within its ranks to underestimate the danger of war, to underestimate future wars, and to underestimate the necessity of carrying out a full and strong struggle in all aspects to win peace.

The resolution calls on Danish Communists to conduct a systematic and purposeful struggle against the divisive activities of the right-wing Social Democrats, and to guide the most advanced sections of the working class to participate in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

The resolution concludes: "The Party Central Committee believes that all organizations of the Party must do everything in their power to strive to establish a broad people's peace movement, to cooperate with the peace forces of all countries, to oppose the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, and war provocateurs, and to defend peace. The unity of the working class is more important now than ever before; we must act jointly with Social Democratic and non-Party workers against the arms race and militarization, and against the bourgeoisie shifting the crisis to the working people. The Central Committee believes that through joint struggle, the demands of employed workers, the demands of unemployed workers for employment, and the demands for improved living conditions can be met, and peace can be guaranteed."

    丹共中央通过决议
    消灭轻视战争危险思想
    广泛开展人民和平运动
    【新华社北京二十二日电】塔斯社哥本哈根讯：最近召开的丹麦共产党中央委员会全体会议所通过的决议，于十九日在丹共机关报国土与人民报上刊出。
    决议宣称：按照共产党情报局一九四九年十一月决议中的观点，中央委员会着重指出，共产党员及拥护和平的人们，假如看到反帝国主义和平阵营已经巩固，便得出国际形势已经没有那样紧张的结论，那就是一个严重的错误。帝国主义者的地位越困难，他们便越要使世界陷入新的破坏惨重的战争中。丹麦现正被加速改变为美国反苏侵略战争的前哨。丹麦的政策所招致的经济负担、通过苛重的赋税、货币的贬值与物价的高涨而转嫁给丹麦劳动人民。但是，只要人民的广大阶层决心奋起保卫和平，就能够制止帝国主义的战争政策。因此，党必须消灭队伍中所存在的轻视战争危险，轻视未来战争，对于进行充分可能的，包括各方面的坚强斗争以争取和平的必要性估计过低的倾向。
    决议号召丹麦共产党员对右翼社会民主党的制造分裂的活动进行有系统的、有目的的斗争，并且引导工人阶级最先进的部分参加争取和平民主与社会主义的斗争。
    决议最后宣称：“党中央委员会认为，党的一切组织必须尽其所有的力量，为建立广泛的人民和平运动而努力，以与各国和平力量相配合，反对马歇尔计划、北大西洋公约和战争挑拨者，保卫和平。工人阶级的团结在目前比过去任何时候都更为重要，必须与社会民主党的和无党派的工人共同行动，反对军备竞赛和军国主义化，反对资产阶级把危机转嫁给劳动人民，在这种共同行动中去实现团结。中央委员会认为：经过共同的斗争，就业工人的要求，失业工人的就业要求及改善生活状况的要求，能够得到满足，和平能够得到保障。”
