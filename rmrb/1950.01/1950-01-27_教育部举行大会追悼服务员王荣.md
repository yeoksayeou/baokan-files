The Ministry of Education Holds Memorial Service for Attendant Wang Rong

[This newspaper] (This is to indicate that the "this newspaper" is implied from the original Chinese use of a column title) This newspaper reports: Wang Rong, an attendant at the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, suddenly passed away due to heart failure on the 23rd of this month. Wang Rong was 62 years old. He came from a poor family and spent his entire life selling his labor. He made a living by pulling rickshaws, selling snacks, and working as a handyman. Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, he suffered endless torment and pain. After the liberation of Beijing, Wang Rong transferred to the People's Revolutionary University as a cook. His enthusiasm for labor was high, and he worked conscientiously and actively, earning the title of Labor Hero. During his time working at the Ministry of Education, he continued to work actively. After the People's Government announced the measures for issuing the People's Victory Indexed Bonds, Wang Rong immediately tightened his belt, took the lead in subscribing, and fully demonstrated the fine qualities of the working people in loving the motherland. On the afternoon of the 25th, the Ministry of Education held a memorial service in the ministry's auditorium. Minister Ma Xulun presided over the ceremony. Approximately 300 people attended, including ministry employees and Wang Rong's family members.

    教育部举行大会追悼服务员王荣
    【本报讯】中央人民政府教育部服务员王荣，于本月二十三日突以心脏麻痹症病故。王荣现年六十二岁，家境贫苦，一生出卖劳力，曾先后靠拉洋车、卖点心、当工友等糊口，在国民党反动派统治下，受尽了折磨与痛苦。北京解放后，王荣转入人民革命大学当炊事员，劳动情绪高涨，工作认真积极，荣获劳动英雄称号。当他在教育部工作期间，仍然积极工作。人民政府公布发行人民胜利折实公债办法后，王荣即节衣缩食，带头认购，充分表现了劳动人民热爱祖国的优良品质。二十五日下午教育部特假该部大礼堂举行追悼大会。由马叙伦部长主祭。到会者计有该部员工及王荣家属等共约三百余人。
