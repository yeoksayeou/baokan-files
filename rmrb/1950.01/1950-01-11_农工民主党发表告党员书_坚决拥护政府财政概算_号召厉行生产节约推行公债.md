    Democratic League of Chinese Agrarian Labor Issues Letter to Members
    Firmly Support the Government's Budget Estimate
    Calling for Strict Production and Savings, and Promoting Public Bonds
    [This Newspaper's Dispatches] To endorse the Central People's Government's decision on the 1950 National Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Budget Estimate and the issuance of the People's Victory Parity Unit Public Bonds, the Central Committee of the Democratic League of Chinese Agrarian Labor issued a letter to all members, stating in brief: We deeply understand that the current difficulties in the national financial and economic situation are a temporary and inevitable phenomenon in the process of our country's unprecedented great victory of the people's revolution. Chairman Mao said, "Our financial situation is difficult, and we must explain our difficulties to the people and not hide them. But at the same time, we must also explain to the people that we have ways to overcome the difficulties. Since there are ways to overcome the difficulties, our cause is hopeful and our future is bright. Our situation will get better year by year, and it is estimated that next year will be better than this year. Within three to five years, our economic undertakings can be fully restored, and within ten to eight years, our economy can achieve great development." We fully agree with Chairman Mao's view, and we are full of confidence. We fully support the 1950 fiscal revenue and expenditure budget estimate and are willing to work hard for its full realization. We also firmly support the issuance of the Victory Parity Unit Public Bonds. The characteristics of the Chinese People's Victory Parity Unit Public Bonds are: first, they are issued on the basis of national victory and can fully guarantee the repayment of principal and interest on schedule; second, they are calculated at parity unit, not only without any loss, but also with favorable interest, which is equivalent to one's own savings; third, the time is not long, and the repayment of principal and interest will begin after one year and be repaid in full in five years; fourth, it is beneficial to both the public and private sectors, helping the country to overcome difficulties and benefiting oneself at the same time, so why not do it. Everyone should unite and firmly support this fiscal revenue and expenditure budget estimate. We must set an example by strictly practicing economy ourselves, reducing unnecessary expenses, and participating in production as much as possible. Then, we must actively promote to the people the practice of economy, reduce unnecessary expenses, work hard in production, increase tax sources, and strive to ensure that the government's expenditure does not exceed the budget estimate, and that the income can at least guarantee 100% of the realization of this budget estimate. Everyone should unite and work hard to promote this People's Victory Parity Unit Public Bonds. We must take the lead in enthusiastically subscribing to them, launch a competition campaign, buying as much as possible, and then actively promote people to subscribe as much as possible, striving to complete the task of issuing public bonds ahead of schedule."

    农工民主党发表告党员书
    坚决拥护政府财政概算
    号召厉行生产节约推行公债
    【本报讯】中国农工民主党中央委员会为拥护中央人民政府通过的一九五○年全国财政收支概算和发行人民胜利折实公债的决定，发表告全体党员书，略称：我们深切知道，目前国家财政经济的困难，是在我国空前的人民大革命伟大胜利过程中一种暂时的不可避免的现象。毛主席说：“我们的财政情况是有困难的，我们必须向人民说明我们的困难所在，不要隐瞒这种困难。但是我们同时也必须向人民说明，我们折实有办法克服困难。既然有办法克服困难，我们的事业就有希望的，我们的前途是光明的。我们的情况会一年比一年好起来，估计明年比今年好。在三年五年的时间内，我们的经济事业可以完全恢复，在十年八年的时间内，我们的经济就可以得到巨大的发展。”我们完全同意毛主席这种看法，我们是完全有信心的。我们对一九五○年度财政收支概算完全拥护并愿为其完全实现而努力。我们对发行胜利折实公债，也是坚决拥护的，中国人民胜利折实公债的特点：第一是在全国胜利的基础上发行的，完全可以保障按期归还本利；第二是折实计算，不但毫无损失，而且获有利息，等于自己储蓄；第三是时间不长，一年之后，即开始还本付息，五年还清；第四是公私两利，既帮助国家克服困难，又于自己有利，何乐不为。大家一致起来，坚决地拥护这个财政收支概算，我们要以身作则，自己先厉行节约，减少不必要的开支，尽可能地参加生产事业，然后积极地向人民广为宣传厉行节约，减少不必要的开支，努力生产，增加税源，争取政府支出不超过概算，而收入能起码保障这个概算百分之百的实现。大家一致起来，努力推行这个人民胜利折实公债，我们要自己先行踊跃认购，展开竞赛运动，购得愈多愈好，然后积极推动人民尽量认购，争取提前完成公债发售的任务。”
