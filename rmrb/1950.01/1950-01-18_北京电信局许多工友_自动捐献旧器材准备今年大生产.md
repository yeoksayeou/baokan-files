Many Workers at Beijing Telecommunications Bureau
　　Voluntarily Donate Old Equipment to Prepare for This Year's Great Production

[This newspaper dispatch] To prepare for the great production of 1950, workers at the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau voluntarily donated a great deal of equipment to subsidize their factory. Most of it was what the factory lacked and could not buy. Zhou Guoliang, head of the mechanical workshop of the Second Factory, donated his own tools intended for opening a small iron factory, twenty-six dozen hacksaw blades of various sizes, twenty pieces each of 55-degree and 60-degree plates, and a small cabinet with forty-eight drawers, totaling approximately 968,000 RMB; A lineman from the Second Team of the Line Section donated a piece of oil-soaked rubber cloth for cables, which is indispensable for soldering cables and cannot be purchased on the market. Linemen Lu Zhanyuan and Zhao Qitai donated a No. 2 portable tester, worth approximately 2 million RMB. The ten employees of the Xijiao Direct Group use their spare time every day to retrieve line equipment left by the Kuomintang bandit troops in the vicinity. The equipment retrieved in five days is worth approximately 10 million RMB. Guan Zhixin, Chen Changshun, and Fu Zhenhua, three linemen from the Xiyuan Bureau, retrieved 81 kilograms of 1.6 iron wire and two utility poles left by the Kuomintang bandit troops between Wanshou Mountain and Landianchang in three days, worth approximately 1.2 million RMB. Zhao Shun, Zhu Chengliang, linemen from the Mentougou Group, and You Xiangyun, director of the business office, retrieved 85 kilograms of 4.5 iron wire from the bandit troops, worth approximately 1 million RMB. In addition, there are many other instances of donating smaller equipment and retrieving small items. When the Xijiao Bureau retrieved equipment from the bandit troops, it was snowing heavily, and the telephone operators braved the wind and snow to transport it from more than ten miles away without asking for any compensation.

    北京电信局许多工友
    自动捐献旧器材准备今年大生产
    【本报讯】为了准备一九五○年大生产，北京电信局工友自动献出许多器材，补助自己的工厂。其中大部分是厂中缺乏、并且是买不到的东西。二厂机工股股长周国梁将其本人想开设小铁工厂用的器具、各号钢锯条二十六打、五五度及六○度板各二十块、四十八屉小立柜一具一同献出，约折合人民币九十六万八千元；线路科二队线务员献出电缆用油垫橡皮布一块，这是接焊电缆不能缺少、而又在市面上购不到的。又如线路科工人卢占元，赵启泰献出二号携带试验器一具，约值人民币二百余万元。西郊直属小组全体职工十人，每日利用班余时间去撤回附近国民党匪军遗留线路器材，五日中撤回之器材共约值人民币一千余万元。西苑局线务员管质信、陈长顺、傅振华三位同志，三天中在万寿山至兰靛厂间撤回国民党匪军遗留一·六铁线八十一公斤及两棵电杆，约值一百二十万元。门头沟小组线务员赵顺、朱成亮及营业处主任尤祥云三位同志撤回匪军四·五铁线八十五公斤，约值百余万元。此外，献一些较小的器材、撤回些小东西的事情还很多。西郊局撤匪军器材时，正值大雪，话务员们都冒着大风雪去到十余里外去搬运，不要任何报酬。
