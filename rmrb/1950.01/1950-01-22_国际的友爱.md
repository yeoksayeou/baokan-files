International Friendship
    Li Yang

    --On the evening of December 12, 1949, the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles jointly sponsored a dance performance in Beijing, performed by the Choi Seung-hee Dance Research Institute of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, performing classical and modern Korean songs and dances, using Eastern style and Korean national forms to express Korean customs, suffering, and her struggle for liberation from Japanese imperialism. I was not only moved by their beautiful art; inspired by the victory of their people's democracy; and reminded of two Korean comrades; hence this poem.

    Fifteen years ago,
    In a Shanghai prison,
    I met a
    Korean revolutionary youth,
    His name was Ma Yuehan,
    He was strong and handsome.
    He often leaned against
    The iron window that let in a ray of sunlight,
    Softly and passionately,
    Singing to us
    An ancient song of your nation,
    The song was called "Arirang."
    The song was melancholy and sad,
    I seemed to hear
    The groans of your oppressed nation;
    The song was mournful and angry,
    I seemed to see
    Your nation's unyielding struggle.
    I wrote him a poem:
    Hoping that when he returned to his homeland,
    He would bring back a healthy and happy song,
    To sing among your brothers and sisters,
    Uniting outstanding sons and daughters,
    To fight against imperialism.

    Ten years ago,
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan,
    I met another
    Brave girl from your country,
    She was a member of the Korean Volunteer Army,
    Her name was Vina.
    She also sang to me
    That old "Arirang."
    I wrote a poem for you,
    For her to recite:
    "We will build a new Korea,
    Build a new world!"

    Last year, I visited
    Your new country after liberation,
    Visiting your capital, Pyongyang.
    The Taedong River was so blue,
    The ever-green pine trees,
    Surrounded the tomb of Gija. (Note)
    I love the sails on Chinnampo,
    I love the golden waves of rice
    Rippling in your autumn fields,
    I also love
    Your girls'
    Slender and white clothing.
    I heard you
    Playing Beethoven's symphonies,
    And young male and female singers
    Singing excitedly and joyfully -
    No longer that old,
    Sad, mournful "Arirang."

    I walked on the streets of Pyongyang,
    I saw the people's ranks marching forward,
    Red flags fluttering above their heads.
    I seemed to see
    Your John and Vina,
    Laughing in that procession.
    I also heard everywhere:
    You are cheering for Kim Il-sung,
    You are cheering for Stalin.
    I also seemed to hear
    Vina and John shouting there -
    Even if they had died in battle long ago.

    Today,
    In the capital of our People's Republic,
    Beijing, filled with five-star red flags,
    I saw your beautiful dances again,
    Heard your
    Exciting and striving songs.
    Your songs and dances,
    Mark your long-standing culture,
    Beautiful poems and arts;
    Your songs and dances,
    Also mark the victory of the people,
    The new birth of your nation.
    I seemed to see again
    Your John and Vina,
    Appearing on the magnificent stage,
    Dancing with you,
    Singing with you -
    Even if they had died in battle long ago.

    In your days of victory,
    In our days of victory,
    Today, I write poems, dedicated to
    Your emerging republic,
    Congratulating us on moving towards a common ideal,
    Congratulating the profound friendship of internationalism.

                            December 27, 1949, in Beijing.
    (Note) There is a tomb of Gija in Pyongyang. Gija is said to have been the Grand Tutor of the Shang Dynasty.

    国际的友爱
    力扬
    ——一九四九年十二月十二日晚上，中华人民共和国中央人民政府文化部与中华全国文学艺术界联合会在北京联合主办舞踊晚会，由朝鲜人民民主主义共和国的崔承喜舞踊研究所演出，表演朝鲜民族的古典的和现代的歌舞，以东方的气派和朝鲜的民族形式，表现出朝鲜的风习、苦难，以及她从日本帝国主义的压迫下获得解放的斗争的历程。我不仅被他们的优美的艺术所感动；被他们人民民主的胜利所鼓舞；并想念起两个朝鲜的战友；因成此诗。
    在十五年以前，
    我在上海的监狱里，
    认识你们朝鲜的
    一位革命青年，
    他的名字叫做马约翰，
    他是壮健又英俊。
    他常常倚着
    那透射进一线阳光的铁窗，
    低声地，热情地，
    向我们唱着一只
    你们民族的古歌，
    那歌名叫做“阿里浪”。
    那歌声忧郁又伤感，
    我仿佛听见
    你们民族被压迫的呻吟；
    那歌声悲凉又愤怒，
    我仿佛看见
    你们民族不屈的斗争。
    我写给他一首诗：
    希望他回到祖国的日子，
    带回去一只健康而快乐的歌，
    在你们兄弟姊妹间唱着，
    团结起优秀的儿女，
    向帝国主义斗争。
    十年以前，
    在抗日的战争中，
    我又遇见一位
    你们勇敢的姑娘，
    她是朝鲜义勇队的队员，
    她的名字叫做维娜。
    她同样地向我唱着
    那只古老的“阿里浪”。
    我为你们写过一首诗，
    由她去朗诵：
    “我们要建立新的朝鲜，
    建立新的世界！”
    去年，我到过
    你们解放后的新国家，
    拜访你们的首都平壤。
    大同江是那样的碧蓝，
    千年长绿的苍松，
    围绕着箕子的坟场。（注）
    我爱着镇南浦上的风帆，
    我爱着你们秋天的田野上
    荡漾着黄金的稻浪，
    我也爱着
    你们姑娘们的
    修长而洁白的衣装。
    我听过你们
    演奏着贝多芬的交响乐，
    和青年男女歌手们
    兴奋而欢乐的歌唱——
    再不是那支古老的
    忧伤、悲凉的“阿里浪”。
    我走在平壤的街道上，
    我看见人民的行列在前进，
    红旗在他们的头顶上飘扬。
    我仿佛看见
    你们的约翰和维娜，
    欢笑在那队伍里边。
    我又到处听见：
    你们在欢呼着金日成，
    你们在欢呼着斯大林。
    我又仿佛听见
    维娜和约翰在那里呼喊——
    即使他们早在战斗中死亡。
    今天，
    在我们人民共和国的首都，
    插满五星红旗的北京，
    我又看见你们优美的舞蹈，
    听见你们的
    激扬而奋发的歌声。
    你们的歌舞，
    标志着你们悠久的文化，
    美好的诗歌和艺术；
    你们的歌舞，
    也标志着人民的胜利，
    你们民族的新生。
    我又仿佛看见
    你们的约翰和维娜，
    在辉煌的舞台上出现，
    和你们一起舞蹈，
    和你们一起歌唱——
    即使他们早在战斗中死亡。
    在你们胜利的日子，
    在我们胜利的日子，
    今天，我写着诗，献给
    你们新兴的共和国，
    祝贺我们向着共同的理想前进，
    祝贺国际主义的深厚的友爱。
                            一九四九年十二月二十七日于北京。
    （注）平壤有箕子坟。箕子传为商朝的太师。
