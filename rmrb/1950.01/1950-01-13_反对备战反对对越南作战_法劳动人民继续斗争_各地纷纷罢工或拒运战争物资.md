    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: TASS, Paris: The French laboring people are waging a strong struggle against war preparations and the colonial war in Vietnam. On January 9th, French police once again attacked striking workers at the Maurens-Soualnier aircraft factory in Tarbes, southern France, searching union headquarters and workers' homes. However, the workers resisted the police suppression and decided to continue the strike. Dockworkers in Nantes and Rouen, following the example of dockworkers in Saint-Nazaire, refused to handle American war materials. The Nantes Dockworkers and Seamen's Union Committee unanimously decided that the port of Nantes would not unload any weapons or war materials. The Rouen Dockworkers' Union adopted the same decision. Workers at the Toulon Codfish Arsenal decided not to unload the Île de France ship, currently docked in Toulon, and load it with war materials destined for Vietnam.
    Many enterprises in Marseille announced a 24-hour or 48-hour strike on the 10th, opposing the continuation of the Vietnam War. Railway workers in Marseille also held a 24-hour strike. The movement of the French people demanding the prohibition of atomic bombs is developing day by day, and peace committees have been established in many enterprises across the country.
