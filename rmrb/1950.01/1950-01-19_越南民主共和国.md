    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is welcoming the victorious spring of 1950 with all its strength. The final victory of the Vietnamese people – complete liberation of the homeland, expulsion of the French imperialist aggressor forces beyond the borders, and the thorough elimination of their running dog, the Bao Dai reactionary clique – will make the world's peaceful and democratic camp even stronger, while causing the imperialist groups, who vainly attempt to make Southeast Asia their base of aggression, to tremble and lose color!

    During the eighty years of French imperialist occupation, the Vietnamese people never ceased their heroic struggle. When Japanese fascists invaded Vietnam during World War II, the Vichy government immediately surrendered to the Japanese and acted as accomplices. Under the leadership of the Vietnam Independence League (founded in 1941 under the leadership of the Vietnamese Communist Party), the Vietnamese people independently carried out the struggle for independence against Japanese aggression. On August 19, 1945, this struggle finally achieved a great outcome: the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On March 3, 1946, the first National Assembly of the Vietnamese people convened in Hanoi and elected Ho Chi Minh as the President of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Bao Dai, the last dynasty of Vietnam, was forced off the stage by the power of the people. From then on, the history of the Vietnamese people began a new page.

    In order to re-enslave the Vietnamese people, the French imperialists, with the assistance of the British imperialists, attacked the Vietnamese people on September 23, 1945. Subsequently, they concluded the "Franco-Vietnamese Agreement" twice in 1946, but this was merely a smokescreen for preparing for a war of aggression. Shortly after the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on December 19, 1946, the French imperialists launched a shameless and barbaric attack on the Vietnamese people. However, three years of war have proven that the strength of the Vietnamese people is growing, the liberated areas are expanding, while the French imperialists have consumed hundreds of billions of francs. In the first two years of the war alone, 71,300 French troops were killed, 63,900 were wounded, 2,900 were captured, and 8,863 defected. The French imperialist invading army has been squeezed by the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army into a very few isolated strongholds such as Hanoi, Saigon, and Haiphong. Its "High Commissioners" and "High Generals," as the Vietnam News Agency said, are "being replaced and dismissed one after another like changing shirts." However, the armed forces of the Vietnamese people, like the rising sun, have grown from the initial 20,000 regular troops to dozens of times that number, from guerrilla warfare to mobile warfare, from eliminating small strongholds to liberating large cities, from attacking scattered patrols to annihilating convoys of hundreds of vehicles at a time, from only learning to use rifles and light machine guns to being familiar with howitzers, armored vehicles, and tanks. In the most recent campaign, namely the battle in the Hoa Binh area west of Hanoi, the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army continuously destroyed 18 French strongholds, annihilated nearly a thousand French troops, and liberated 10 million square kilometers of land. Now the Democratic Republic of Vietnam controls 95% of the country's territory, with a population of over 21 million, while the French-occupied area has less than 2 million people.

    The growth of the Vietnamese people's power is also manifested in the close unity of Vietnamese workers, farmers, intellectuals, urban poor, and national bourgeoisie around the People's Alliance - the Viet Minh. The Vietnamese workers' organization, the Labor Federation, has 300,000 members, the Vietnam National Women's Federation has 2 million members, and over 1 million farmers have joined their own organization - the Farmers' Union. In addition, there are youth alliances and many progressive groups of school students. The Viet Minh currently has 13 million members, accounting for more than half of the country's total population.

    In 1948, although Cochinchina only cultivated seven-tenths of the pre-war land, its harvest was equal to 2.5 million tons in 1937-38. The All-Vietnam Farmers' Cadre Conference, which closed on December 10 last year, resolved to increase national food production by 10% this year to actively support the liberation war.

    The industry of the Vietnamese people is also gradually developing, and the output of industries such as textiles, footwear, and paper is increasing. Significant progress has been made in cultural and educational undertakings. In the past, French imperialists replaced schools with hotels and opium dens. According to statistics in 1938, there were 120,000 hotels and more than 1,700 opium dens in Vietnam, while there were only four primary schools. Today, in the people's Vietnam, illiteracy has been reduced from 85% to 20%, there are already 2,142 primary schools with 277,000 students, and there are specialized schools such as law schools and medical schools. Engineers, agricultural technicians, doctors, teachers, and other talents are continuously increasing.

    These victories of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are inseparable from the patriotism of the broad masses of the people. Vietnamese workers, while fighting the enemy, complete the glorious task of supporting the front with production under the difficult conditions of lacking tools and raw materials. Behind enemy lines, movements to sabotage transportation, strikes, slowdowns, and destruction are launched, causing significant losses to the enemy. The Vietnam Trade Union Conference held last December listed "How the Vietnamese Working Class Fights for the Independence, Peace, and Democracy of the Country" as the first task in its discussions. Vietnamese women enthusiastically support the front lines, care for the wounded, help the families of soldiers with production and labor, and build new dikes to protect millions of acres of fields from floods. In the enemy-occupied areas, they do everything possible to help the guerrillas. The Vietnamese people sell rice to the army at low prices, solving the food problem for the troops, and the Vietnamese workers and farmers transport weapons and food to the army along the Cao Bang-Lang Son highway, working for millions of hours. This is a mass support movement.

    However, the French imperialists and their running dog Bao Dai are heading down a steep slope. Although the French imperialists, under the orders of the US imperialists, signed an agreement with Bao Dai in March 1949 to sell out Vietnam, and put Bao Dai on stage again in June, they still cannot reverse their precarious situation. Under the impact of the torrent of the Vietnamese people, the French people, and the people of the world, the French cabinets have fallen one after another, the Marshall Plan-ized French economy is heading towards collapse, and the general strike of five million French workers has forced the French imperialist war machine in Vietnam to gradually become paralyzed. The contradictions and disputes within the traitor Bao Dai's camp are also increasing. In front of the Vietnamese people, there are still very arduous fighting tasks.

    Vietnam has now established diplomatic relations with our country and is one of our friendly nations. The flesh-and-blood friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people will surely be further developed in the future struggle for victory.

    越南民主共和国
    越南民主共和国，正以全部力量迎接一九五○年胜利的春天。越南人民的最后胜利——完全解放国土、驱逐法帝侵略势力于国境以外并彻底消灭其走狗保大反动集团，将使世界和平民主阵营力量更为强大，而使妄图将东南亚成为侵略基地的帝国主义集团颤抖、失色！
    越南人民在法帝国主义侵占的八十年间，从没有间断过英勇的斗争。当第二次世界大战期间日本法西斯侵入越南时，维琪政府立即投降日帝并且作了帮凶，越南人民在越南独立同盟民族阵线（一九四一年在越共领导下成立）领导下，单独地进行反抗日本侵略的独立斗争，至一九四五年八月十九日，这一斗争终于获得了伟大的成果：越南民主共和国成立。一九四六年三月三日，越南人民第一届国民大会召开于河内，并选出胡志明任越南民主共和国政府主席。越南最末一个王朝——保大为人民力量冲击下台。从此，越南人民的历史开始了新的一页。
    法帝国主义者为了重新奴役越南人民，在英帝国主义者协助下，于一九四五年九月二十三日进攻越南人民，其后，曾经于一九四六年内两度缔结“法越协定”但这不过它准备侵略战争的烟幕。在越南民主共和国成立后不久，一九四六年十二月十九日，法帝国主义者便向越南人民发动了无耻野蛮的进攻。然而三年来的战争，证明越南人民的力量在壮大，解放区在扩展，而法帝国主义者则已消耗了数以千亿计的法郎，仅作战头两年内，法军即被击毙七万一千三百人，伤六万三千九百人，被俘两千九百人，投诚者八千八百六十三人。而法帝国主义者的侵略军队已被越南人民解放军挤到河内、西贡及海防等极少数的几个孤立据点去。它的“高级专员”及“高级将军”们，正如越南通讯社所说的，“像换衬衣一样的一个接着一个地更换和撤职”。但是，越南人民的武装力量则如旭日东升一样，从最初的两万正规军现已壮大到数十倍，从游击战转到了运动战，从消灭小据点转到解放大城市，从袭击零星的巡逻队转到一举歼灭成百辆的汽车队，从只学会使用步枪和轻机枪转到熟悉榴弹炮、装甲车和坦克。在最近一次的战役中，即在河内以西和平地区的战斗中，越南人民解放军连续摧毁法军据点十八处，歼法军近千名，解放了广达一千万公里的国土。现在越南民主共和国已控制全国领土的百分之九十五，拥有二千一百万以上人口，而法帝占领区还不到二百万人。
    越南人民力量的壮大还表现在越南工人、农民、知识分子、城市贫民及民族资产阶级都紧密地团结在人民联盟—越盟的周围，越南工人的组织劳工联盟拥有三十万会员，越南全国妇女联合会有二百万会员，一百万以上的农民加入了他们自己的组织——农民同盟，此外还有青年同盟及许多学校学生的进步团体。越盟盟员现达一千三百万，占全国总人口半数以上。
    一九四八年交趾支那虽只耕种战前的十分之七的土地，而其收获量却等于一九三七——三八年的二百五十万吨。去年十二月十号闭幕的全越农民干部会议上，决议今年全国增产食粮百分之十，积极支援解放战争。
    越南人民的工业也在逐步发展，如纺织品、鞋类和纸张等工业产量日渐提高。文化教育事业则有显著的进展。以前法帝国主义者以酒店与鸦片烟馆来代替学校，据一九三八年统计：越南有十二万家酒店与一千七百多家烟馆，初级小学则只有四所，今天的人民越南，文盲从百分之八十五减到百分之二十，小学已有二千一百四十二所，容有学生二十七万七千人，并且有了法学院、医学院等专门学校。工程师、农业技术家、医生、教师以及其他各种人材络续增加着。
    越南民主共和国的这些胜利是与广大人民群众的爱国主义分不开的。越南工人一面与敌作战，一面在工具原料缺乏的困难条件下，完成生产支前的光荣任务。在敌人后方，则展开破坏交通、罢工、怠工、破坏的运动，使敌人受到重大损失。去年十二月举行的越南工会会议将“越南工人阶级如何为国家的独立、和平与民主而斗争”列为讨论中第一项任务。越南妇女们热烈地支援前线，关怀伤员，帮助军人家属生产劳动，建筑新堤，使百万田亩免于水灾，在敌占区则尽一切力量帮助游击队。越南人民以贱价售米给军队，解决了部队食粮问题，而越南的工人、农民为高平——谅山公路沿线的军队输送武器和粮食，工作的时间达数百万小时之多，这是群众性的支援运动。
    但是，法帝国主义及其走狗保大正走着险陡的下坡路。法帝国主义虽然受命于美帝国主义在一九四九年三月与保大签订了出卖越南的协定，六月又使保大粉墨登场，但仍不能挽回它的危局，在越南人民、法国人民以及全世界人民力量巨流冲击下，法帝内阁一连串倒台，马歇尔计划化的法国经济走向崩溃，五百万法国劳动人民的总罢工，迫使法帝国主义的侵越战争机构日渐瘫痪。卖国贼保大阵营里的矛盾与争执也日渐加多。在越南人民面前，还摆着十分艰巨的斗争任务。
    越南现在已经与我国建立了外交关系，是我国的友邦之一，中越人民的血肉相连的友谊在未来争取胜利的斗争中必能更加发扬光大。
