Rich resources but a weak industrial base - this is the result of the Northwest's long-term suffering under reactionary rule. How to develop the Northwest's industrial construction in a planned and gradual manner based on the existing foundation will become one of the important contents of China's new economic construction work.

The industrial economy of the Northwest (including handicrafts) accounts for only slightly less than 5% of the entire Northwest national economy. According to incomplete statistics, excluding rural household handicrafts, Shaanxi has 876 handicraft textile factories with 4,960 workers, producing 120 yarn pieces and over 29,800 bolts of cloth per month. Gansu has 126 waterpipe tobacco workshops, producing 16 million catties of waterpipe tobacco annually. Xinjiang is famous for its Hotan silk fabrics, with an average annual output of over 70,000 bolts. In Lanzhou, more than 50 handicraft woolen mills have started operating after liberation. Coal mining in Gansu and Ningxia, and the timber, ceramics, oil pressing, brewing, and papermaking industries that are common throughout the Northwest, are almost entirely manual operations. The scale of modern industry in the Northwest is not large, and the number is also very small. There are currently three state-owned oil factories, the largest being Yumen Oilfield, followed by Yanchang in northern Shaanxi. Although Xinjiang has abundant oil reserves, only the Dushanzi Refinery was engaged in production under the Kuomintang rule, and the output was not large. There are a total of five machinery factories, two in Shaanxi, which can produce 4,000 spindles per year. The three factories in Lanzhou, Yinchuan, and Xining have not yet fully recovered due to the serious destruction caused by the Kuomintang bandits. The total power generation capacity in the Northwest is no more than 20,000 kilowatts. The modern light industry in the Northwest is mainly cotton and wool textile and flour industry. The cotton textile industry is concentrated in the Xi'an and Baoji areas, with a total of more than 99,000 spindles and about 1,500 looms. Among them, three factories belong to the state-owned Northwest People's Textile Company, with a total of more than 33,000 spindles and 270 looms. There are three modern wool textile factories in the Northwest, all concentrated in Lanzhou, two of which are state-owned, with a total of 2,200 spindles and more than 60 looms. There are six state-owned flour mills in the Northwest, two each in Xi'an and Lanzhou, and one each in Yinchuan and Ili, with a monthly output of 45,500 bags of flour. There are also 23 private flour mills in Shaanxi Province alone, with a monthly output of 490,000 bags of flour. In addition, there are small-scale chemical, match, leather, cement, and papermaking industries, which are scattered in several larger cities in the Northwest.

The existing industrial equipment in the Northwest is very disproportionate compared to the Northwest's rich resources and mineral deposits, especially the mining industry and heavy industries such as oil refining and power generation, which are particularly weak. The Northwest's oil reserves account for 99.5% of the country's total reserves, with Xinjiang having the most, with mining areas distributed in northern and southern Xinjiang. The oilfields in southern Xinjiang are close to the Soviet East Turkestan oilfields and have the best quality. Gansu is second, followed by northern Shaanxi, with Yanchang as the focus. The Northwest's coal accounts for 40% of the country's total reserves, with Shaanxi having the richest reserves, reaching 71.16 billion tons, mostly distributed north of the Weihe fault. Xinjiang is second, with reserves of 31.9 billion tons. The thickness and quality of the Pingluo coal seam in Ningxia are rare in the country. Salt, an important raw material for people's food and the chemical industry, is produced in many places in the Northwest, especially in Xinjiang, where the annual output of rock salt and beach salt reaches 600,000 dan. Secondly, the salt production of 13 pools such as Chahan Buluke and Yaburai in Alxa League, Ningxia, and the Chaka Salt Lake in Dulan, Qinghai, is also abundant. It is estimated that the Chaka pool alone has salt reserves of over 300 million tons. The annual output of alkali in Shenmu, northern Shaanxi, also reaches 8,600 tons. Xinjiang's gold reserves are second only to the Northeast, with the Altai Mountains mining area covering an area of 800 square kilometers, and the larger gold nuggets weighing 44 taels. The Northwest's gypsum accounts for more than 80% of the country's total reserves, with Gansu Province alone reaching 500 million tons. As for the Yellow River and the glaciers of the Tianshan, Kunlun, Qilian, and Jishi Mountains within the Northwest, the available power generation is estimated to be over 35 million horsepower. In addition, the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi and Xinjiang produce a total of 1.3 million dan of cotton per year, with Guanzhong accounting for over 1 million dan. "Jingwei cotton" is white, soft, and long, with extremely high quality. The Northwest's fur and wool are also major products, with an annual output of 500,000 dan of wool and over 4.54 million pieces of various hides.

The establishment of modern industry in the Shaanxi-Gansu area began around 1935 when the Longhai Railway was opened to traffic. During the Anti-Japanese War, factories in Shanghai and Hankou moved inland, coupled with the Japanese blockade and the decreasing import of British and American foreign goods, the industry in the Shaanxi-Gansu area gained an opportunity for development. The number of factories, taking Shaanxi as an example, increased from 38 at the initial stage to 312 in 1945. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, due to the dumping of American goods, the number of factories in Shaanxi decreased to 127 in 1948. As for the industry in Xinjiang, thanks to the technical assistance from the Soviet Union during the Anti-Japanese War, it also developed for a time, and gradually established oil refining, leather making, papermaking, and electrical factories. However, under Sheng Shicai's and the Kuomintang's anti-Soviet and anti-communist policies, this assistance from the Soviet Union was buried, resulting in the already established industry shrinking again. Now, the reactionary rule in the Northwest has been overthrown, the imperialist aggressive forces have been driven out of China by the Chinese people, and the rich resources of the Northwest are now owned by the Chinese people. In the future, the Northwest will gradually be built into an industrial base of the new China, and the people of the Northwest will also forever break free from the historical fate of poverty and backwardness.

    西北的工业和矿藏
    资源丰富但工业基础薄弱，这就是西北长期遭受反动统治的结果。如何从现有基础上有计划地逐步地发展西北工业建设，将成为新中国经济建设工作中的重要内容之一。
    西北的工业经济（包括手工作坊在内），在整个西北的国民经济中，只占百分之五弱。据不完全的统计，除农村家庭手工业外，陕西有手工纺织工厂八百七十六家，工人四千九百六十人，月产纱一百二十件，布二万九千八百余匹。甘肃有水烟坊一百二十六家，年产水烟一千六百万斤。新疆有著名的和阗丝织品，平均年产七万余匹。兰州的手工毛织厂，解放后开工者，达五十余家。甘肃、宁夏的采煤和普遍西北各地的木业、陶瓷、榨油、酿造、造纸等，几乎全系手工作业。西北的现代工业规模不大，数目也非常少。现有国营石油厂三处，其中以玉门油矿最大，陕北延长次之。新疆石油储量虽丰，但在国民党统治时，仅有独山子炼油厂一所从事生产，且产量不大。机器工业共有五个厂，陕西的二个厂，每年可制纺纱机四千锭；在兰州、银川和西宁的三个工厂，因遭受国民党匪帮的严重破坏，尚未完全恢复。西北的发电量合计不过二万千瓦。西北的现代轻工业以棉、毛织业和面粉工业为主。棉纺织业集中在西安、宝鸡一带，共有纱锭九万九千余枚，布机约一千五百台。其中属于公营西北人民纺织公司的有三个厂，共有纱锭三万三千余枚，布机二百七十台。西北的机器毛纺织业共有三个厂，均集中在兰州，其中两家为公营，共有纺锭二千二百枚，织机六十余台。西北面粉工业，公营的共六个厂，计西安、兰州各二家，银川、伊犁各一家，月产面粉四万五千五百袋。私营的在陕西境内即有二十三家，月产面粉四十九万袋。此外尚有小规模的化学、火柴、皮革、水泥、造纸等工业，则分散在西北若干较大的城市中。
    西北现有的工业设备与西北丰富的资源矿藏比较起来是很不相称的，特别是矿业和制油、发电等重工业，尤感弱小。西北的石油储量占全国总储量的百分之九九．五，以新疆为最多，矿区分布在南北疆，其中南疆的油田与苏联东土耳其斯坦油田接近，品质最佳。其次为甘肃。再次为陕西北部，以延长为重点。西北的煤占全国总储量的百分之四十，以陕西藏量为最富，达七百一十一亿六千万吨，大部分布在渭河断层以北。新疆次之，储量达三百一十九亿吨。宁夏平罗煤层之厚、品质之优，全国亦不多见。为人民食用及化学工业重要原料的食盐，西北产地很多，尤以新疆为最，所产岩盐、滩盐年达六十万担。其次宁夏阿拉善旗擦汉布鲁克、雅布赖等十三池及青海都兰境之茶卡盐池盐产亦丰。茶卡一池估计储盐达三亿吨以上。陕北神木一地的碱，年产亦达八千六百吨。新疆黄金储量之富，仅次于东北，其中阿尔泰山矿区面积有八百方公里，金块大者重四十四两。西北石膏占全国总储量百分之八十以上，其中甘肃一省达五亿吨。至于西北境内的黄河和天山、昆仑山、祁连山及积石山的冰川，可利用的发电，合计当在三千五百万匹马力以上。此外陕西关中地区和新疆，共年产棉花一百三十万担；其中关中占百万余担。“泾渭棉”洁白柔长，品质极高。西北皮毛亦为大宗产物，年产羊毛五十万担，各种皮四百五十四万余张。
    陕甘一带现代工业的建立，开始于一九三五年陇海铁路通车前后。抗日战争中，上海和汉口的工厂内迁，加上日寇的封锁，英美外货进口日少，陕甘一带工业乃获得发展的机会。工厂数目，以陕西为例，自初建时的三十八家，增加到一九四五年的三百十二家。日寇投降后，由于美货倾销，陕西工厂到一九四八年又减少为一二七家。至于新疆的工业，由于在抗日战争时得到苏联的技术帮助，也曾一度发展，逐渐建立了炼油、制革、造纸、电气等工厂。但是在盛世才和国民党反苏反共的政策下，苏联的这种援助被葬送了，结果使已经建立起来的工业，又萎缩下去。现在，西北的反动统治被推翻了，帝国主义的侵略势力已被中国人民驱逐出去了，西北丰富的资源已为中国人民所有，今后西北将逐渐地被建设成为新中国的工业基地，西北人民也将永远挣脱贫困落后的历史命运。
