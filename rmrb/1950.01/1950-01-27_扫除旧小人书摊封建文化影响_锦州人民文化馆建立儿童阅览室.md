    Eliminating the Influence of Feudal Culture from Old Children's Book Stalls:
    Jinzhou People's Cultural Center Establishes Children's Reading Room
    [Our Newspaper Jinzhou Correspondence] In order to effectively eliminate the influence of feudal culture spread by old children's book stalls among the vast number of children, and to supplement children's learning of textbooks in school from multiple perspectives, the Jinzhou People's Cultural Center began to establish a children's reading room in early December last year. The reading room has more than 2,800 children's books, divided into seven categories and 213 types, including political common sense, children's literature and art, introductions to the Soviet Union, applied science, natural science, stories, operas, magazines, and newspapers, all of which are new progressive cultural reading materials. Every day during opening hours, groups of children line up in long queues, waiting to enter the reading room. According to statistics from the first twenty days of opening, a total of 4,300 children were absorbed into the reading room to study. The highest record on Sundays was 350 people, and the lowest was 120 people, with an average of 210 people studying in the reading room every day. The children who come to read are mostly students in the first, second, third, and fourth grades, with very few out-of-school children, and most are between the ages of seven and seventeen. They are extremely interested in the reading room. A student in the third grade of the No. 11 Primary School, seeing that some of the windows in the cultural center were very dirty, mobilized the entire class to wipe the windows, in order to repay the cultural center for serving the children. A student from the Dianye Primary School said: "After reading 'Little White Rabbit,' I know that it made a mistake. I wonder if I have made any mistakes myself?" Some children said: "I want to learn from Little Chapayev!" It can be seen that the progressive reading materials in the reading room have begun to play a role in the minds of the vast number of children. The crowds of children around the old children's book stalls by the roadside have gradually become sparse.
    The Cultural Center has gained some preliminary experience in establishing the children's reading room: 1. Management issues. In the beginning, because the children were not organized, they shouted as soon as they entered the hall: "I want to take the one with swords and guns!" "I want the one with dogs snatching food from pigs!" This made the administrator dizzy, and many books were lost. Therefore, the first problem is to manage the children to maintain order and develop good habits. Only in this way can they truly learn something and not damage or lose books. This problem is solved in two ways: one is collective borrowing, with five or more people as a group, and the group leader borrows books according to the needs of each person. The group leader is responsible for not damaging the books and for presiding over discussions and maintaining order. The second is to cultivate backbones, based on children who frequently come to the center and older children, organize them and provide specific help, educate them to serve the children, explain the principles to younger children, and maintain order. 2. The problem of organizing books. Reading materials should be organized according to the actual needs and levels of the children. According to surveys, children in the first and second grades like to read comics and animal stories such as "Big Leather Shoes" and "Little White Rabbit," while children in the third and fourth grades like to read historical hero stories such as "The Great Lenin" and "Combat Heroes." Children in the fifth and sixth grades like to read natural science stories or war stories such as "Crossing the Yangtze River." They should be divided into three parts according to their needs: for the first and second grades, for the third and fourth grades, and for the fifth and sixth grades. 3. Take advantage of the holidays to organize. For example, now is the winter vacation period. Learning groups can be organized according to the children's winter vacation schedule, and contact them proactively. The group leader leads the group, borrows and returns books uniformly. Hold regular seminars, led by the group leader. After reading each book, report心得 (心得: what they've learned); select typical cases and report them at children's lectures every week. In this way, children can gain a deeper understanding of the content of the books.

    扫除旧小人书摊封建文化影响
    锦州人民文化馆建立儿童阅览室
    【本报锦州通讯】为了有效的扫除旧小人书摊给广大儿童散布封建文化的影响，及从多方面的补助儿童在校内课本学习的不足，锦州市人民文化馆去年十二月初开始建立儿童阅览室。该阅览室共有儿童读物二千八百余册，分七类二百一十三种，其中包括政治常识，儿童文艺，苏联介绍，应用科学，自然科学，故事，歌剧，杂志报纸等，都是新的进步文化读物。每天开放的时间，总有成群的儿童摆起长长的行列等着进入阅览室。据开放后二十天的统计，共吸收了四千三百个儿童到阅览室来学习，每星期日最高纪录为三百五十人，平时最低也有一百二十人，平均每天有二百一十人到阅览室学习。来阅读的儿童多为一、二、三、四年级学生，失学儿童很少，年龄多在七岁以上十七岁以下。他们对阅览室极感兴趣。十一完小三年级的一个小同学，看到文化馆有些房子的玻璃很脏，动员了全班同学来擦玻璃，为了报答文化馆的为儿童服务。电业完小的一位小同学说：“我看了《小白兔》，知道它是犯了错误了，我也想我自己是不是也犯了呢？”有的小朋友说：“我要向小夏伯阳学习！”，可以看出，阅览室的进步读物，已在广大儿童的思想上开始起了作用。马路旁边的旧小人书摊，拥挤着的儿童现在已渐渐稀少了。
    该文化馆在建立儿童阅览室的工作当中，得到几点初步经验：一、管理问题。开始时，因为儿童没有组织，一进馆就乱嚷嚷：我要拿“带刀带枪的”，“我要狗抢猪食的”！弄得管理员头昏眼花，书也丢了许多册，所以第一个问题是要管理儿童守秩序，养成良好习惯。这样才能使他们真正学到东西，不损坏或丢掉书籍。解决这一问题，用两个办法，一是集体借读，以五人以上为一小组，由小组长根据每人需要借书，小组长负责不损坏，并负责主持讨论和维持秩序。一是培养骨干，以经常来馆及年龄较大的儿童为基础，组织起来并给以具体帮助，教育其为儿童服务，给年龄小的儿童讲解道理并维持秩序。二、图书的整理问题。读物应按儿童的实际需要与程度深浅来整理。据调查，一、二年级的小孩爱看漫画、动物故事如《大皮鞋》、《小白兔》等，三、四年级的儿童爱看历史英雄故事如《伟大的列宁》、《战斗英雄》等。五、六年级的儿童爱看自然科学故事或战争的故事如《渡长江》等，应根据他们的需要分成一、二年级用，三、四年级用，五、六年级用等三部。三、利用假期，组织起来。如目前正是寒假期间，可按儿童寒假期间编制的学习小组，主动与他们联系，由小组长带领，统一借读，统一送还。定期召开座谈会，由小组长掌握，每阅完一册，互相报告心得；选出典型，每周到儿童讲座上做报告。这样使儿童能更深入地了解书的内容。
