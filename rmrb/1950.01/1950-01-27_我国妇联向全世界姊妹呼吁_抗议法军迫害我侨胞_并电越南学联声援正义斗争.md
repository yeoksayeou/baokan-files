    The All-China Democratic Women's Federation Appeals to Sisters Worldwide
    Protests French Army's Persecution of Overseas Chinese
    Cables Vietnam Student Union to Support Just Struggle
    [This newspaper's report] To protest the outrageous atrocities of the French army and the Bảo Đại government army stationed in Vietnam against our overseas Chinese, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation issued an appeal to peace-loving sisters around the world, asking everyone to pay attention to and protest this atrocity, and to provide support. The appeal states:
    According to a telegram from the Overseas Chinese Council of the ten northern provinces of Vietnam, on the night of November 19 last year, the French army and the Bảo Đại government army stationed in Vietnam brutally beat more than 160 overseas Chinese, and gang-raped all the female overseas Chinese residents. One pregnant woman was raped to death on the spot. The overseas Chinese property was looted and villages were burned down. Such inhumane atrocities have occurred several times in Ha Dong Province and Hong Gai Special Zone, Vietnam. At the same time, the French authorities in Vietnam have harbored the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit army who fled into Vietnam, allowing them to continue to harm the Chinese people. Such conspiracies to kill Chinese overseas citizens and harbor reactionary remnants demonstrate the French authorities' hostility towards the Chinese people and their contempt for the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people. This is absolutely intolerable to all Chinese people. We lodge a serious protest with the French government! The great victory of the Chinese people tells the world that the Chinese people have now stood up firmly and that the interests of the Chinese people must not be violated and must be respected.
    On behalf of all Chinese women, in addition to demanding that the French government and the French authorities in Vietnam severely punish the perpetrators, compensate all the losses of the victimized overseas Chinese, and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again, we specifically appeal to peace-loving and democratic sisters all over the world. Please pay close attention to and protest against the unreasonable atrocities of the French army stationed in Vietnam, and give us your support. In particular, we ask the French people and women to immediately stop the French army's aggression against Vietnam and demand the withdrawal of the French army stationed in Vietnam.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th] On the 20th, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation sent a telegram to Nguyen Tong, Chairman of the Vietnam Student Union, and forwarded it to all Vietnamese students, supporting their just appeal to the world, and expressing great indignation at the atrocities of the French imperialists and their puppet Bảo Đại government in massacring Vietnamese students. The telegram stated: The brutal and bloody rule of the French imperialists and their running dogs is merely a desperate struggle. The struggle of the Vietnamese people will surely achieve complete victory. We Chinese women guarantee that we will make our best efforts to support your struggle, and strive to overthrow imperialism and defend world peace and democracy.

    【本报讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会为了抗议驻越南的法国军队和保大政府军对我华侨的无耻暴行，向全世界爱好和平的姊妹发出呼吁书，要求大家注意与抗议这种暴行，并给予支援。略称：
    据越南北部十省华侨理事会来电称，驻越南法国军队和保大政府军，于去年十一月十九日深夜将一百六十余华侨施以毒打，又轮奸全体女侨民，一孕妇当场被奸惨死，并将华侨财物抢劫一空，纵火焚毁村庄，而且似此惨无人道的兽行，已经连接在越南河东省、鸿基特区发生过几次。同时越南法国当局又收容了逃入越南的国民党残余匪军，使其保存继续祸害中国人民。似此种种杀害中国侨民，窝藏反动派残余的阴谋，都说明了法驻越南当局对中国人民的敌意，对中国人民正当权益的蔑视，这是全中国人民所绝对不能容忍的，我们向法国政府提出严重的抗议！中国人民伟大的胜利向全世界说明：现在中国人民已经坚强地站起来了，是中国人民的利益不容侵犯，必须受到尊重的时候了。
    我们代表全中国妇女除了要求法国政府及驻越法当局严惩凶手，赔偿受难侨胞的一切损失，并保证以后不再发生类似的事情外，特向全世界爱好和平民主的姊妹们，发出呼吁，请你们密切注意与抗议驻越法军这种无理的暴行，并给我们以支援，特别要求法国的人民和妇女立即阻止法军之侵越行为，并要求撤退驻越南的法军。
    【新华社北京二十六日电】中华全国民主妇女联合会于二十日致电越南学生联合会主席阮松并转越南全国学生，声援他们向全世界所作的正义呼吁，并对法帝国主义及其傀儡保大政府屠杀越南学生的暴行表示极大的愤慨。电文称：法帝国主义及其走狗残暴的血腥统治，只是垂死的挣扎。越南人民的斗争，必将取得完全的胜利。我们中国妇女保证将尽最大的努力来支援你们的斗争，为打倒帝国主义和保卫全世界的和平与民主而奋斗。
