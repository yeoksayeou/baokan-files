Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th. The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government decided at a vehicle inventory meeting held on the 10th of this month that a nationwide vehicle inventory will be conducted simultaneously on February 5th. This is a necessary step to accurately grasp the number of railway vehicles nationwide, their condition, and operational status, thereby formulating comprehensive vehicle overhaul, replenishment, and transportation plans, and improving transportation efficiency. Minister Teng Daiyuan pointed out at the meeting: Now that the main railway lines across the country are clear and unblocked, the conditions for the inventory are fully in place. It was impossible to do this during the Kuomintang's rule, but People's China has the confidence and determination to complete this task.

    全国各铁路车辆情况二月五日举行大清查
    【新华社北京十七日电】中央人民政府铁道部于本月十日召开的车辆清查会议上决定，二月五日全国同时举行车辆大清查。这是正确地掌握全国铁路的车辆数目、车辆状态和运用情况，从而制定完善的车辆检修、补充和运输计划，提高运输效率的必要步骤。滕代远部长在这次会议中指出：现在全国铁路主要干线都已畅通无阻，清查条件已充分具备。国民党统治时期无法做到这一点，而人民中国却有信心、有决心完成这个工作。
