Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: TASS Paris: Workers in the port of Marseilles, France, held a strike and massive demonstration on the 10th to protest the colonial war in Vietnam. According to reports published by Parisian newspapers on the 11th, railway workers in the port of Marseilles held a 24-hour strike on the 10th. The vast majority of workers in steel, hardware, chemical, construction, textile, electricity, gas, and other industries in Marseilles and its surrounding areas, as well as dockworkers and most sailors, responded to the call of the provincial trade union federation and went on strike. Marseilles tram workers also joined the strike. On the same day, railway workers in Pauligne, Arles, Nîmes, Nice, Toulon, and other French cities also stopped work to support the Marseilles railway workers.

The working people of Marseilles defied the ban and held a massive demonstration. The marching ranks sang the Marseillaise and shouted, "Peace for Vietnam! Salute to the sailors of the Bastille! We want peace!" The procession went to the monument to the martyrs of the Resistance and the victims of the war, where a mass rally was held. As the procession continued, it was blocked by the police, who brutally beat the demonstrators. Several people were injured. However, the powerful ranks of the working people broke through the blockade and demonstrated in the streets for an hour, demanding an end to the criminal colonial war in Vietnam.
