    Lenin and the Question of Literature and Art
    By A. Miusinikefu, Translated by Jiuquan
    In the great, diverse, and monumental legacy left by Lenin, the part concerning literature and art occupies a prominent position. As is well known, Lenin loved art and was a brilliant and profound art critic. He valued art, considering it a major weapon in political and social struggles.
    The Party spirit of literature is the basic principle of Lenin's aesthetic thought. Zhdanov, in his brilliant report on the magazines "Zvezda" and "Leningrad," said, "Lenin was the first person to define with extreme clarity the attitude of progressive social thought towards literature and art." The representative of progressive social thought is the Party, and based on this attitude, Lenin defined the principle of the Party spirit of literature. Zhdanov continued, this principle is Lenin's "important contribution to the science of literature and art."
    During the revolutionary period of 1905, Lenin published his essay, "Party Organization and Party Literature." "It is impossible to live in society and be free from society." This formula contains a genius-like profundity, and starting from here, Lenin made a severe criticism of bourgeois literature. It was also on the basis of this formula that he planned the main characteristics of proletarian literature.
    Bourgeois artists and art theorists have spoken a great deal about the absolute freedom of art; they claim that art does not depend on social conditions, but is entirely determined by the artist's preferences and fantasies. Lenin proved that the individualism advocated by the bourgeoisie is a manifestation of the bourgeois, anarchist worldview. He exposed the hypocritical theories of bourgeois scholars that art in bourgeois society is neutral. Lenin asked: "Gentlemen writers, can you be independent and free from your bourgeois publishers and bourgeois society? ... Bourgeois writers, artists, and actresses only secretly (or hypocritically disguised) rely on the control of moneybags, accept bribes, and receive subsidies."
    The profit-seeking art of the bourgeois world has often been denounced by outstanding representatives of Russian or non-Russian art, even those with political views far removed from Marxism. A writer who has not broken away from the bourgeois viewpoint cannot create genuine works of art because he must defend unreasonable social relations based on the oppression of man by man. To defend, one must lie.
    Lenin wrote, "To say that one is neutral while living in bourgeois society is nothing but a hypocritical, pretentious performance, actually dependent on the rich, the rulers, the exploiters."
    Artists who fight for the interests of workers are completely different. He does not need to cover up his views with the slogan of hypocritical neutrality. He openly unites with the progressive class, fights to overthrow the system of human oppression, and fights for the victory of the noble ideals of mankind. The ideals of the proletariat are noble and pure, and are unanimously supported by the working people. Writers who fight and dedicate themselves to these ideals are openly biased, have Party spirit - that is, wholeheartedly help the progressive development of society.
    Lenin believed that literature is one of the powerful weapons in the struggle to transform society. He wrote: "What is the principle of Party literature? This is not only to say that for the socialist proletariat, literary work is not a tool for a few individuals or small groups to seek profit, and generally speaking, it cannot be a personal, private matter unrelated to the common goals of the proletariat. Down with non-Party writers! Down with superhuman writers! Literary work should become a part of the entire proletarian cause..."
    Lenin pointed out that artists who accept the principles of the Bolshevik Party can become fighters for the lofty ideals of socialism. In this way, the freedom they obtain is true freedom, not illusory freedom. He wrote: "Such literature is free literature, not literature for money or personal gain, and socialist ideas will give it eternally fresh strength."
    Such an artist has a much broader vision than a bourgeois artist; his worldview prompts him to penetrate social phenomena more deeply. He has greater creative possibilities.
    Regarding the culture that fights for the interests of the working people, Lenin wrote: "We will have a free literature that will not serve 'the top few thousand people,' but will serve the tens of millions of workers, who are the flowers, strength, and future of the country."
    Bourgeois theorists often attempt to ignore class contradictions. They sing the delusion of peaceful cooperation between classes and propagate that the past history has always been like this. Lenin severely criticized this reactionary and hypocritical theory. He said: "In every modern country there are two countries." He also said that the culture of the ruling class is the culture of one-tenth of the national population, and the other nine-tenths is the culture of tens of millions of people. This democratic culture grows in the struggle against the culture of the ruling class.
    Regarding national culture, Lenin also said, "In every national culture, there is a democratic and socialist culture, even if they are still in an undeveloped state. Because in every nation, there are laboring and exploited masses whose living conditions inevitably give rise to democratic and socialist ideas." This is why every nation's struggle for independence and freedom is consistent with the interests of all nations.
    Lenin's remarks on the question of literature are a key that can solve the problem of folk art, the problem of our attitude towards the great classical literary heritage, and the problem of our attitude towards the creations of modern writers.
    After the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, the principle of the Party spirit of literature was raised to a new and higher stage. Literary activity is no longer just a part of the Party's work of the proletariat. It has become a part of national policy. Lenin said in his conversation with Zetkin, "In a society based on private property, the artist produces for the market, and he needs customers. Our revolution has liberated the artist from the oppression of these conditions. It has made the Soviet state their protector and customer... But, of course, we are communists. We cannot stand idly by and let things develop on their own. We must lead this development, carry it out according to a fully predetermined plan, and model its results." In the same conversation, Lenin gave a brilliant definition of the mass character of Soviet art. "The question is not only what we think of art, nor is it only what a few hundred or a few thousand people among the tens of millions of people think. The roots of literature must grow in the vast working masses. It must be understood and loved by these vast masses. It must express the feelings, thoughts, and will of these vast masses, it must raise them. It must awaken artists who emerge from the masses and serve their development."
    Lenin tirelessly called on writers to conduct in-depth research on real life. He recognized reality as the unceasing struggle between the old and the new. The genius Lenin was a great dreamer. As early as 1902, in his masterpiece "What Is to Be Done?", he wrote, "We must dream!" He believed that if the dreamer seriously studied life, believed in, and strived for the realization of his dream, then this dream would stimulate his vitality. Lenin often emphasized the role of consciousness, but this consciousness was based on a deep observation of life. He wrote, "Human consciousness not only reflects the objective world, but also creates it."
    Lenin's words are directly related to literature. They help us more fully understand the principles of socialist realism, which not only reflects reality, but also points out the path ahead.
    In 1918, Lenin wrote, "Now no one believes in miracles anymore. Prophecies of miracles are nothing but myths. But scientific prophecies are facts." A socialist realist writer, who starts from the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism and studies life, has the ability of this scientific prophecy.
    In his masterpiece "A Great Beginning," Lenin called on writers and the Soviet people to pay attention to cultivating new buds, "these simple, ordinary, everyday, but truly communist strong buds," which, if properly cultivated, "will not wither, but will grow up, bloom, and become completed communism."
    But a socialist realist writer never creates a kind of life that does not exist in fact, but portrays typical characters in typical environments, emphasizing their developmental tendencies. Soviet writers are active participants in socialist construction.
    Although Lenin was the founder of the new culture, he also cherished the achievements of Russian classical literature very much. Gorky once found a copy of "War and Peace" on Lenin's desk. Lenin talked to Gorky about Tolstoy. Gorky recorded: "Then he squinted at me and asked, 'Can you find another person in Europe who can be compared with him?' He himself answered, 'No, not one.' He rubbed his hands and smiled contentedly. I have noticed his pride in Russian art more than once. Sometimes, I felt that this was not in line with Lenin's character, but later I understood that this was due to his deep love for the working people."
    Lenin also admired progressive foreign writers, such as Barbusse. But he despised those who blindly worshipped reactionary Western art, which is a manifestation of decadent bourgeois culture. In his conversation with Zetkin, he angrily mentioned art critics who madly praised every "new" trend in painting. He said, "Nonsense, utter nonsense! Much is false, they subconsciously blindly praise every fashionable style of Western art... I don't understand what expressionism, futurism, cubism... and such 'isms' are. I don't understand those works. I am not interested in them at all."
    Lenin's theory on literature has been further expanded and developed by Stalin, and has become the leading ideology of the Soviet people and all progressive people in the world. Leninism continues its victorious march, encouraging progressive foreign writers to struggle for peace, democracy, and the happy future of freedom-loving nations.

    列宁与文艺问题
    Ａ·缪斯尼珂夫  作  酒泉  译
    在列宁所留下的伟大的、多样的、纪念碑似的遗产中，关于文学和艺术的部分占据着显著的地位。如所周知，列宁爱好艺术，而且是一个英明而深刻的艺术批评家。他重视艺术，认为它是政治斗争、社会斗争中的一个主要的武器。
    文学的党性是列宁的美学思想的基本原则。日丹诺夫在他的关于《星》及《列宁格勒》两杂志的光辉的报告中说，“列宁是第一个人，他用极端的明确性，规定了进步的社会思想对于文学及艺术的态度。”进步的社会思想的代表者就是党，基于这个态度，列宁规定了文学的党性的原则。日丹诺夫继续说，这个原则是列宁“对于文艺科学的重要贡献。”
    在一九○五年的革命时期中，列宁发表了他的论文，《党的组织与党的文学》。“生活在社会里，却要脱离社会而自由，这是不可能的。”这一公式包含着天才的深刻性，从这里出发，列宁对资产阶级文学作了严厉的批判。也在这公式的基础上，他规划了无产阶级文学的主要特点。
    资产阶级艺术家和艺术理论家说了一大套关于艺术的绝对自由的理论；他们宣称艺术并不依存于社会条件，而是完全由于艺术家的癖好和幻想来决定的。列宁证明了，为资产阶级所鼓吹的个人主义是资产阶级的、无政府主义的世界观的表现。他揭穿了资产阶级学者的虚伪理论，所谓资产阶级社会的艺术是中立的。列宁问道：“作家先生，你能离开你的资产阶级出版商、资产阶级社会而独立自由吗？……资产阶级的作家、艺术家和女演员们只是秘密地（或是伪善地化装着），去依靠钱袋的支配，去接受贿赂，去领取津贴。”
    资产阶级世界的唯利是图的艺术，经常被俄国或非俄国的艺术的优秀代表者们所指斥，即便是那些具有与马克思主义距离很远的政治观点的人们。一个没有脱离资产阶级观点的作家不可能创造真正的艺术品，因为他必须替不合理的社会关系辩护，这个社会关系是基于人对人的压迫。要辩护，就必须撒谎。
    列宁写道，“身处资产阶级社会而说保持中立，无非是一种虚伪的、假装的表现，实际上是依附于富有者、统治者、剥削者。”
    为工人利益而斗争的艺术家是完全不同的。他无需用虚伪的中立的口号来掩盖他的观点。他公开地和进步阶级结合在一起，为推翻人压迫人的制度而斗争，为人类崇高的理想的胜利而斗争。无产阶级的理想是高尚而纯洁的，它们为劳动人类所一致拥护。为这些理想而斗争、而献身的作家，是公开地有倾向的，有党性的，——那就是赤忱帮助社会的进步的发展。
    列宁认为文学是改造社会的斗争的有力武器之一。他写道：“什么是党性的文学的原则呢？这不仅是说，对于社会主义的无产阶级，文学事业不是若干个人的或小集团谋利的工具，并且一般讲起来，它也不能够是个人的，与无产阶级的共同目标无关的私人事情。打倒非党的文学家！打倒超人的文学家！文学事业应该成为整个无产阶级事业的一部份……”
    列宁指示说，接受布尔什维克党的原则的艺术家，就能够成为社会主义的崇高理想的战斗者。这样，他们获得的自由，才是真正的自由，而不是幻想的自由。他写道：“这样的文学才是自由的文学，而不是为了金钱，或个人利益的文学，社会主义的思想将使它获得永远新鲜的力量。”
    这样的艺术家，他的视野比起资产阶级艺术家来，要宽阔得多；他的世界观促使他更深刻地突入社会现象。他具有更广大的创造的可能性。
    关于为劳动人民的利益而斗争的文化，列宁这样写道，“我们将要有一种自由的文学，它将不为‘最上层的几千个人’服务，而是为了千千万万劳动者，他们是国家的花朵，力量和未来。”
    资产阶级理论家常常企图漠视阶级矛盾。他们高唱阶级之间和平合作的妄谈，并宣传过去的历史是一向如此的。列宁痛斥这种反动的虚伪的理论。他说：“在每一个现代国家中有两个国家。”又说统治阶级的文化是全国人口十分之一的人们的文化，另外有十分之九是千千万万人民的文化。这种民主的文化生长于对统治阶级的文化的斗争中。
    关于民族的文化，列宁又说，“在每一个民族的文化中，包含着民主的、社会主义的文化，即使它们还在不发展的状态中。因为在每一个民族里面，包含着劳动的、被剥削的大众，他们的生活条件不可避免地使他们产生民主的、社会主义的思想。”这就是为什么每一个民族的争取独立和自由的斗争，是和所有国家的各民族的利益一致的。
    列宁的关于文学问题的言论，是一把钥匙，它可以解决民间艺术的问题，我们对伟大的古典文学遗产的态度的问题，以及我们对现代作家创作的态度的问题。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利以后，文学的党性的原则提到了一个新的更高的阶段。文学活动不再只是无产阶级的党的工作的一部份。它已经成为国家的政策的一部份了。列宁在和蔡特金的谈话中这样说，“在以私有财产为基础的社会里，艺术家为市场而生产，他需要顾客。我们的革命把艺术家从这些条件的压迫下解放出来。它使苏维埃国家成为他们的保护者和顾客……可是，当然，我们是共产主义者。我们不能袖手旁观让事情自己去发展。我们必须领导这一发展，依据着一个充分预定的计划去进行，并模造它的结果。”在同一次谈话中，列宁对苏维埃艺术的群众性给予一个光辉的定义。“问题不仅在于我们对艺术的意见如何，也不仅是千千万万人民中几百人或几千人的意见如何。文学的根必须长在广大的劳动大众中。它必须是被这些广大群众所懂得的和爱好的。它必须把这些广大群众的感情、思想和意志表现出来，它必须提高他们。它必须唤醒从群众中产生出来的艺术家，并为发展他们而服务。”
    列宁从不疲倦地号召作家们对现实生活加以深刻的研究。他把现实认作是旧与新的不息的斗争。天才的列宁是一个伟大的梦想家。远在一九○二年，他在他的名著《做什么？》中写道，“我们必须梦想！”他认为如果那梦想家严肃地研究过生活，信仰着，并且努力着他的梦想的实现，那么这梦想是会刺激他的活力的。列宁时常强调意识的作用，但这意识是基于对生活的深刻观察得来的。他写道，“人的意识不但是反映客观世界，而且是创造它的。”
    列宁的这些话和文学有直接关联。它们帮助我们更充分地了解社会主义的现实主义的原则，社会主义的现实主义就是不但是反映现实，而且是指示着前面的道路。
    在一九一八年列宁写道，“现在再也没有人相信奇迹了。奇迹的预言不过是神话。可是科学的预言是事实。”一个社会主义的现实主义的作家，他从马列主义的科学的理论出发，并且研究过生活，就具有这个科学的预言的才能。
    在他的名著《一个伟大的开始》中，列宁号召作家和苏维埃人民注意培养新的萌芽，“这些简单的，平凡的，日常的，但是真正的共产主义的强壮的萌芽”，如果适当地加以培养，“将不会枯萎，而是长大起来，开起花来，成为完成的共产主义。”
    但社会主义的现实主义的作家决不是制造事实上决不存在的一种生活，而是刻划典型环境中的典型性格，强调他们发展的倾向。苏维埃作家是社会主义建设中的活跃的参与者。
    虽则列宁是新文化的奠基者，他对于俄罗斯的古典文学的成就也是非常珍视的。高尔基有一次发现列宁桌子上有一本《战争与和平》。列宁就和高尔基谈起托尔斯泰来了。高尔基这样记载着，“于是他挤起眼睛朝我望着问道，‘你能不能找出欧洲另一个人来，能够和他并列呢？’他自己答道，‘没有，一个也没有。’他搓着手满意地笑起来了。我不止一次地注意到他对俄罗斯艺术的骄傲。有时候，我觉得这是和列宁的性格不相附合，但后来我懂得这是由于他对劳动人民有着深挚的爱的缘故。”
    列宁对外国的进步作家也是很推崇的，例如对巴比塞。但是他鄙视那些盲目崇拜反动的西方艺术的人，这种艺术是堕落的资产阶级文化的表现。在他和蔡特金的谈话中他愤怒地提到那些狂赞绘画上的每一种“新”倾向的艺术批评家们。他说，“胡说，完全胡说！许多是虚伪的东西，他们下意识地瞎捧西方艺术的每一种时兴派头……我不了解什么表现派，未来派，立体派……以及诸如此类的‘派’。我不懂那些作品。我对他们一点也不感兴趣。”
    列宁对文学问题的理论，经斯大林更进一步地扩充和发展，已经成为苏联人民和世界一切进步人民的领导思想了。列宁主义继续着他的胜利的进军，鼓励着外国的进步作家们进行着为了和平、民主，为了爱好自由的各民族的幸福的未来而斗争。
