    Lenin and the Question of Literature and Art
    By A. Miusinikefu, Translated by Jiuquan
    In the great, diverse, and monumental legacy left by Lenin, the part concerning literature and art occupies a prominent position. As is well known, Lenin loved art and was a brilliant and profound art critic. He valued art, considering it a major weapon in political and social struggles.
    The Party spirit of literature is the basic principle of Lenin's aesthetic thought. Zhdanov, in his brilliant report on the magazines "Zvezda" and "Leningrad," said, "Lenin was the first person to define with extreme clarity the attitude of progressive social thought towards literature and art." The representative of progressive social thought is the Party, and based on this attitude, Lenin defined the principle of the Party spirit of literature. Zhdanov continued, this principle is Lenin's "important contribution to the science of literature and art."
    During the revolutionary period of 1905, Lenin published his essay, "Party Organization and Party Literature." "It is impossible to live in society and be free from society." This formula contains a genius-like profundity, and starting from here, Lenin made a severe criticism of bourgeois literature. It was also on the basis of this formula that he planned the main characteristics of proletarian literature.
    Bourgeois artists and art theorists have spoken a great deal about the absolute freedom of art; they claim that art does not depend on social conditions, but is entirely determined by the artist's preferences and fantasies. Lenin proved that the individualism advocated by the bourgeoisie is a manifestation of the bourgeois, anarchist worldview. He exposed the hypocritical theories of bourgeois scholars that art in bourgeois society is neutral. Lenin asked: "Gentlemen writers, can you be independent and free from your bourgeois publishers and bourgeois society? ... Bourgeois writers, artists, and actresses only secretly (or hypocritically disguised) rely on the control of moneybags, accept bribes, and receive subsidies."
    The profit-seeking art of the bourgeois world has often been denounced by outstanding representatives of Russian or non-Russian art, even those with political views far removed from Marxism. A writer who has not broken away from the bourgeois viewpoint cannot create genuine works of art because he must defend unreasonable social relations based on the oppression of man by man. To defend, one must lie.
    Lenin wrote, "To say that one is neutral while living in bourgeois society is nothing but a hypocritical, pretentious performance, actually dependent on the rich, the rulers, the exploiters."
    Artists who fight for the interests of workers are completely different. He does not need to cover up his views with the slogan of hypocritical neutrality. He openly unites with the progressive class, fights to overthrow the system of human oppression, and fights for the victory of the noble ideals of mankind. The ideals of the proletariat are noble and pure, and are unanimously supported by the working people. Writers who fight and dedicate themselves to these ideals are openly biased, have Party spirit - that is, wholeheartedly help the progressive development of society.
    Lenin believed that literature is one of the powerful weapons in the struggle to transform society. He wrote: "What is the principle of Party literature? This is not only to say that for the socialist proletariat, literary work is not a tool for a few individuals or small groups to seek profit, and generally speaking, it cannot be a personal, private matter unrelated to the common goals of the proletariat. Down with non-Party writers! Down with superhuman writers! Literary work should become a part of the entire proletarian cause..."
    Lenin pointed out that artists who accept the principles of the Bolshevik Party can become fighters for the lofty ideals of socialism. In this way, the freedom they obtain is true freedom, not illusory freedom. He wrote: "Such literature is free literature, not literature for money or personal gain, and socialist ideas will give it eternally fresh strength."
    Such an artist has a much broader vision than a bourgeois artist; his worldview prompts him to penetrate social phenomena more deeply. He has greater creative possibilities.
    Regarding the culture that fights for the interests of the working people, Lenin wrote: "We will have a free literature that will not serve 'the top few thousand people,' but will serve the tens of millions of workers, who are the flowers, strength, and future of the country."
    Bourgeois theorists often attempt to ignore class contradictions. They sing the delusion of peaceful cooperation between classes and propagate that the past history has always been like this. Lenin severely criticized this reactionary and hypocritical theory. He said: "In every modern country there are two countries." He also said that the culture of the ruling class is the culture of one-tenth of the national population, and the other nine-tenths is the culture of tens of millions of people. This democratic culture grows in the struggle against the culture of the ruling class.
    Regarding national culture, Lenin also said, "In every national culture, there is a democratic and socialist culture, even if they are still in an undeveloped state. Because in every nation, there are laboring and exploited masses whose living conditions inevitably give rise to democratic and socialist ideas." This is why every nation's struggle for independence and freedom is consistent with the interests of all nations.
    Lenin's remarks on the question of literature are a key that can solve the problem of folk art, the problem of our attitude towards the great classical literary heritage, and the problem of our attitude towards the creations of modern writers.
    After the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, the principle of the Party spirit of literature was raised to a new and higher stage. Literary activity is no longer just a part of the Party's work of the proletariat. It has become a part of national policy. Lenin said in his conversation with Zetkin, "In a society based on private property, the artist produces for the market, and he needs customers. Our revolution has liberated the artist from the oppression of these conditions. It has made the Soviet state their protector and customer... But, of course, we are communists. We cannot stand idly by and let things develop on their own. We must lead this development, carry it out according to a fully predetermined plan, and model its results." In the same conversation, Lenin gave a brilliant definition of the mass character of Soviet art. "The question is not only what we think of art, nor is it only what a few hundred or a few thousand people among the tens of millions of people think. The roots of literature must grow in the vast working masses. It must be understood and loved by these vast masses. It must express the feelings, thoughts, and will of these vast masses, it must raise them. It must awaken artists who emerge from the masses and serve their development."
    Lenin tirelessly called on writers to conduct in-depth research on real life. He recognized reality as the unceasing struggle between the old and the new. The genius Lenin was a great dreamer. As early as 1902, in his masterpiece "What Is to Be Done?", he wrote, "We must dream!" He believed that if the dreamer seriously studied life, believed in, and strived for the realization of his dream, then this dream would stimulate his vitality. Lenin often emphasized the role of consciousness, but this consciousness was based on a deep observation of life. He wrote, "Human consciousness not only reflects the objective world, but also creates it."
    Lenin's words are directly related to literature. They help us more fully understand the principles of socialist realism, which not only reflects reality, but also points out the path ahead.
    In 1918, Lenin wrote, "Now no one believes in miracles anymore. Prophecies of miracles are nothing but myths. But scientific prophecies are facts." A socialist realist writer, who starts from the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism and studies life, has the ability of this scientific prophecy.
    In his masterpiece "A Great Beginning," Lenin called on writers and the Soviet people to pay attention to cultivating new buds, "these simple, ordinary, everyday, but truly communist strong buds," which, if properly cultivated, "will not wither, but will grow up, bloom, and become completed communism."
    But a socialist realist writer never creates a kind of life that does not exist in fact, but portrays typical characters in typical environments, emphasizing their developmental tendencies. Soviet writers are active participants in socialist construction.
    Although Lenin was the founder of the new culture, he also cherished the achievements of Russian classical literature very much. Gorky once found a copy of "War and Peace" on Lenin's desk. Lenin talked to Gorky about Tolstoy. Gorky recorded: "Then he squinted at me and asked, 'Can you find another person in Europe who can be compared with him?' He himself answered, 'No, not one.' He rubbed his hands and smiled contentedly. I have noticed his pride in Russian art more than once. Sometimes, I felt that this was not in line with Lenin's character, but later I understood that this was due to his deep love for the working people."
    Lenin also admired progressive foreign writers, such as Barbusse. But he despised those who blindly worshipped reactionary Western art, which is a manifestation of decadent bourgeois culture. In his conversation with Zetkin, he angrily mentioned art critics who madly praised every "new" trend in painting. He said, "Nonsense, utter nonsense! Much is false, they subconsciously blindly praise every fashionable style of Western art... I don't understand what expressionism, futurism, cubism... and such 'isms' are. I don't understand those works. I am not interested in them at all."
    Lenin's theory on literature has been further expanded and developed by Stalin, and has become the leading ideology of the Soviet people and all progressive people in the world. Leninism continues its victorious march, encouraging progressive foreign writers to struggle for peace, democracy, and the happy future of freedom-loving nations.
