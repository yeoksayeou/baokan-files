    Young Soviet Mining City

    On the Donets steppe, with its crisscrossing ravines and rolling hills, stands a city of thousands of houses. This city, Novoshakhtinsk, is a rapidly developing industrial center in the Rostov Oblast, and it arose during the early years of Stalin's Five-Year Plans. Before the revolution, the remote village of Nesvetay consisted of only a few dozen sheds and dugouts, and the so-called industry of the village consisted of four manual mines. In the very short period after the revolution, a new socialist city was built there, including many first-class coal mining industrial enterprises.
    The city's growth is visible to the naked eye. Every year, 150 to 200 sturdy stone houses are built. The families of miners who once lived in dilapidated and dim sheds and dugouts have moved into these new houses. Today, the city has built several schools and shops, clinics, clubs, sports fields, and water stations with cooling parks.
    But during the six months of fascist occupation, the city was destroyed and looted. The residents of Novoshakhtinsk enthusiastically engaged in the restoration of their city with selfless spirit.
    Post-war Novoshakhtinsk has greatly expanded its borders and become more beautiful, with new villages and new streets. In the post-war years, more than 4,000 houses have been built privately alone. In addition, miners have obtained more than 20,000 square meters of new housing area from the state. Not long ago, a new street with beautiful houses on both sides was built in the "West Capital" mining village, named after the Soviet hero Yerokhin.
    The network of schools, libraries, clubs and other cultural life institutions has greatly increased compared to before the war. Now the city has seventeen schools, two night schools, and seven factory schools. In the "Nesvetay Anthracite Mine" United Company and many mines, there are schools to improve the skills of miners. Six clubs, seven permanent cinemas, eight radio stations, several libraries and cultural palaces all serve the cultural needs of the residents of Novoshakhtinsk.
    The state's concern for the health of the workers is great. In this city, there are six clinics, a municipal hospital, women's and children's consulting rooms, seven nurseries, a children's milk kitchen, thirteen kindergartens and several pharmacies.
    Novoshakhtinsk is not only famous for its high-quality anthracite coal and many huge mines, but also has many famous figures - true heroes on the labor front. Here, more than 500 miners have completed their five-year quotas. The names and portraits of many heroes on the labor front are displayed on the city bulletin board, the cultural palace and the workers' club.
    The welfare of the miners is steadily improving. Now it is no longer surprising that almost every miner's family has a motorcycle, bicycle, radio, etc. Twelve miners have also ordered "Victory" brand cars, including the Socialist Labor Hero Maisak.
    The young mining city has a bright future. According to the government's decision, the general plan for the construction of Novoshakhtinsk has now begun to be drawn up. Next year, the first tram line from the city center to the Kirov mine village and the club in the engineer and technician staff area will be laid. Bright and spacious new houses will be built, the streets and squares of the city will be paved with asphalt, and new gardens and parks will be planted.

    The soldiers of the Railway Corps, in neat ranks, fully armed, marched in majestic steps towards the conference venue. The crowd immediately stirred, and pears, cartons of cigarettes, peanuts, and dates were thrown at the soldiers' backpacks. The soldiers politely returned them, but the crowd sincerely threw them back. The soldiers were deeply moved by the people's love. Their hard work for several months had been rewarded. What could be more precious than winning the love of the people?
    In the first few nights, it was snowing heavily at the Cixian site. Under the illumination of torch-like flares, the soldiers worked tensely in the heavy snow, wearing raincoats. The work was even more tense on the night before the track was joined. Those lifting rails and carrying sleepers moved forward one after another. Those nailing the tracks didn't even straighten their backs, nailing one and then rushing to nail the next. Everyone had a common belief: join the track tomorrow and let the train from Beijing go all the way to Wuhan. Suddenly someone shouted: "The joint is coming! Listen, the train is calling from the other side!" "Work! We'll join the track tomorrow!" Then there was a series of clanging sounds of steel rails falling to the ground, the clanging of hammers hitting the spikes, and the anxious roaring of locomotives, forming a great symphony of labor.
    Today, the People's Railway Corps, walking proudly behind the military flag, amidst the cheers of the people, are the commanders and fighters of the Fourth Detachment who completed the last section of this major artery in the wind and snow a few nights ago. At this moment, they are cherishing such a vow in their hearts: "The Beijing-Hankou Railway repair project has been completed. But new tasks are waiting for us, and new work is about to begin. How many sleepers the people need us to carry, and how many spikes they need us to hammer, we will carry that many sleepers and hammer that many spikes. We must resolutely repair the railways throughout China for the people!"

    苏联年青的矿工城
    在沟谷纵横、丘陵起伏的顿涅兹草原上，有一座数千栋房屋的城市。这座诺沃沙赫金斯克城是正在很快地发展着的罗斯托夫省的工业中心，它兴起在斯大林头几个五年计划的年月里。革命前在偏僻的涅斯维泰村庄仅有几十所敞棚和土窑，所谓该村的工业是由四个手工矿坑所组成的，而在革命后非常短的时期内，在该村已建立起包括许多头等煤矿工业企业的新的社会主义城市。
    该城的成长是亲眼可见的。每年都建筑起一百五十所至二百所坚固的石头房屋。在半破残的暗淡的敞棚和土窑里居住过的矿工家属已搬进这些新的房屋。如今在城里已兴建了几所学校和商店、诊疗所、俱乐部、运动场和附设有纳凉公园的水站。
    但是在法西斯占领的六个月之内，该城曾被破坏和掠夺一空。诺沃沙赫金斯克城的居民，就以奋不顾身的精神热情地从事自己城市的恢复工作。
    战后的诺沃沙赫金斯克城大大地扩大了自己的边境和更加美丽了，增添了新的村庄，出现了新的街道。在战后年月里，仅私人所建筑的房屋就有四千余所。此外，矿工们还获得了国家二万余平方公尺的新住宅面积。不久前，在“西卡皮塔里那亚”矿工村曾建筑了两旁有漂亮住宅的新街道，该街道以苏联英雄业罗欣为名。
    比战前大大的增加了学校、图书馆、俱乐部和其他文化生活机关网。现在该城有十七所学校、二所夜间中学，七所工厂学校。在“涅斯维泰无烟煤矿”联合公司和许多矿坑里有提高矿工熟练程度的学校。六所俱乐部、七所固定电影院、八所无线电分站、数所图书馆和文化宫都为诺沃沙赫金斯克城居民的文化需要而服务。
    国家对劳动者健康的关心是很大的，在这城里有六所诊疗所、市立医院、妇女和儿童顾问所、七处托儿所、儿童用乳厨房、十三所幼稚园和数所药房。
    诺沃沙赫金斯克城不仅因上等的无烟煤和许多巨大的矿坑而出名，他有不少的闻名人物——劳动阵线上的真正的英雄。这里有五百余矿工已完成了自己的五年定额。劳动阵线上的许多英雄名字及其肖像挂在市揭示板上、文化宫和工人俱乐部内。
    矿工的福利稳定地提高着。现在这些已经不足为奇了，差不多每个矿工家里都有摩托脚踏车、自行车、无线电收音机等。有十二个矿工并已定购了“胜利牌”汽车，其中社会主义劳动英雄马依萨克也在内。
    年青的矿工城有着美丽的未来。根据政府的决定现已开始制订兴建诺沃沙赫金斯克城的总计划。明年将着手敷设从市中心到基洛夫矿坑村和工程师技师工作人员区俱乐部的第一条电车路线，将要增建起光亮而宽敞的新房屋，用沥青铺平该城的街道和广场，绿化新的花园和公园。
    铁道兵团的战士们排着整齐的行列，全副武装，迈着雄壮的步伐走向大会会场，群众的行列立刻骚动起来，梨子、整盒的烟卷、花生、枣子向战士们背包掷来，战士们好意地退回去，群众又诚恳地掷回来，战士们被群众的热爱所深深感动。他们几个月来的辛苦得到了报酬，有什么能比获得人民的热爱更宝贵的吗？
    头几天夜里，在磁县现场上，天下着鹅毛大雪，在火龙似的火把照耀下，战士们披着雨布冒着大雪紧张地工作。到接轨前一天的夜里，工作更是紧张。抬铁轨的，扛枕木的，一个按着一个向前赶。钉道的连腰也不直，钉完这个就忙去钉那个。大家都有一个共同信念：明天接轨，叫北京开出的列车一直开到武汉去。突然有人高喊：“快接头啦，都听着那边火车叫唤啦！”“干哪，明天接轨呀。”接着是一阵阵钢轨落地的铿锵声，铁锤打道钉的叮当声，机车焦急的呼吼声，组成一支伟大的劳动交响曲。
    今天昂然的走在军旗后面，走在老百姓欢呼声中的人民铁道兵团正是前几天晚上在风雪中完成这支大输血管最后一节的四支队指战员们。此刻，他们心中正怀着这样一个誓愿：“京汉路抢修工程完成了。但新的任务在等待着我们，新的工作正要开始。人民需要我们扛多少枕木打多少道钉，我们就扛多少枕木打多少道钉，我们要坚决为人民修通全中国的铁路！”
