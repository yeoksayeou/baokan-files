Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 15th: The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front held its fourth meeting on the 9th. After hearing the report by Central Committee member Park Heon-young on the current situation in South Korea and the tasks of various political parties and social organizations, the meeting unanimously adopted a letter to all Korean people and patriotic political parties and social organizations.

The letter to the people first pointed out: The Lee Seung-man bandit gang, with the support of American imperialism, is carrying out its conspiracy to undermine the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and provoke civil war. In the four years from 1945 to 1949, the Lee Seung-man bandit gang massacred more than 149,000 patriotic people. In the latter half of last year alone, they massacred more than 62,000 people. The Lee Seung-man bandit gang has destroyed South Korea's production and rural economy, plunging the lives of the vast majority of the people into poverty.

The letter to the people further pointed out: Under the current situation, the primary task of the Korean people is to strengthen the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. The letter called on people from all walks of life, democratic parties, and social organizations to hold high the banner of the People's Republic, and to do everything possible to overthrow the obstacles on the road to the fatherland's unification and independence - the American aggressor forces, the Lee Seung-man bandit gang, and the "United Nations Korean Commission." Vigorously support the South Korean People's Guerrilla forces and consolidate the democratic base in the northern half.
