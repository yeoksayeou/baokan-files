(Reported by this newspaper) The autumn grain collection work in Hubei Province, with the exception of the Enshi district, which was newly liberated, and the Yichang district, which was busy supporting the army's westward advance and had not yet completed the grain collection task, has been victoriously completed in all other areas by mid-December. Throughout the entire autumn grain collection process, landlords and local bullies in various places invariably tried their best to undermine the people's government's reasonable burden policy, concealing large amounts of land, falsely reporting household registrations, and dispersing grain, attempting to transfer the burden to the peasants. Liu Shiming, a landlord in Sanzhen Township, Xiaogan County, did not report his household registration and had not paid any grain in the year since liberation. Not only that, but they also pretended to be poor and complained, stubbornly deceiving the people's government. Some landlords used clan relationships to provoke disunity among the peasants. Such examples are too numerous to mention. In addition, some landlords and local bullies used their original ruling foundations, controlling baojia [a system of neighborhood control], colluding with bandits, and other methods to manipulate the concealment of land. However, after the broad masses of peasants gradually recognized the conspiracy of the landlords and local bullies, their enthusiasm for the anti-concealment of land struggle and the delivery of public grain increased day by day. In Hanyang County, ten days after the deployment of autumn grain collection work, the county discovered more than 110,000 mu of concealed land by landlords and local bullies, and the burden on the peasants was generally reduced. In Sibaobao, Tuanpo District, Xishui County, because the yield was assessed fairly, the peasants excitedly and spontaneously shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" They also organized children's teams to beat gongs and drums, joyfully sending off the militia grain delivery teams. Peasants in the Liulin District of Sui County called this public grain "emancipation grain." Therefore, the victory of the anti-concealment of land struggle in the autumn grain collection work is the most important factor in reducing the burden on the peasants. And fully utilizing peasant representative meetings, controlling and utilizing the old baojia, and crushing the conspiracies of landlords and local bullies have become the most important links in the autumn grain collection work. Through the peasant representative meeting, Erbao in Taiyang Township, Wangjiahe District, Huangpi, struggled against Zhang Hongli, a big local bully who took the lead in concealing land, and discovered more than thirty shi of unreported grain and confiscated 184 guns from the puppet township government. Encouraged by the victory, the peasants paid their public grain in full within two days and spontaneously organized a self-defense team of more than 50 people to protect the warehouse.

In the anti-concealment of land struggle, two kinds of deviations were commonly seen in various places. One was not paying attention to policies, not distinguishing between objects, and blindly opposing everyone. A cadre in Huarong District, Echeng, wrote on the blackboard newspaper: "Regardless of rich or poor, those who conceal land will be punished." In Xiaogan County, a cadre test was held in October, and more than 60% of the cadres in the county did not understand the burden policy or only understood the general principles and could not calculate the burden method. The other deviation was reflected in the cadres' lack of forward courage. When the work was initially deployed, without investigation and research, they blindly said: "The task is too heavy and cannot be completed." When the anti-concealment of land movement in various places initially developed and achieved some results, they became complacent and stopped moving forward. In the summer grain collection in Jiubao, Fankou District, Echeng, only 800 mu of land were initially reported, but eventually more than 4,000 mu were found. At the beginning of the autumn grain collection, some cadres said: "It's almost done, we have no problems here." But after another land survey, more than 8,000 mu have now been found. In the entire Hubei Province, the amount of land concealed by landlords is astonishingly large. The amount of concealed land discovered this time is generally one to two times the originally reported acreage, and in some areas it even reaches six to seven times. In order to prevent and correct deviations in the work, Huangpi, Xiaogan, Huanggang, Wuchang, and other counties held party representative meetings or cadre meetings before the deployment of autumn grain collection work, inspected the implementation of policies in the summer grain collection work, and criticized and commended the cadres. Huangpi County launched a competition among the districts, which enabled the entire district to overfulfill its task in forty days. These are all good experiences, but the central link of cadre education must be the implementation of policy thinking, otherwise it will easily lead to cadres developing an acute disease of simply completing the task.

    揭露地主恶霸挑拨阴谋
    湖北秋征基本完成
    反瞒田斗争鼓舞农民缴粮热情
    【本报讯】湖北省秋季征粮工作，除恩施分区刚解放，宜昌分区忙于支援大军西进，尚未完成征粮任务外，其他各地已于十二月中全部胜利完成。在整个秋征工作过程中，各地地主恶霸，无例外的想尽办法破坏人民政府的合理负担政策，大量隐瞒田地，虚报户口，分散粮食，想把负担转嫁给农民。孝感县三镇乡地主刘士明，没有报户口，解放一年来没有交过一次粮。不仅如此，他们还装穷叫苦，死拖活赖欺骗人民政府，有的地主则利用宗族关系挑拨农民的团结。这样的例子是举不胜举的。此外，若干地主恶霸更利用他们原有的统治基础，用控制保甲，勾结土匪等办法，来操纵瞒田。但广大农民群众在逐渐认清了地主恶霸的阴谋后，他们反瞒田斗争和交公粮的热情日益高涨，汉阳县在布置秋征工作十天后，全县即查出地主恶霸的瞒田十一万余亩，农民负担普遍减轻。浠水县团陂区四保因为产量评得公平，农民们兴奋得不由自主的喊起“毛主席万岁！”来，他们并组织儿童队打着锣鼓，欢送民兵送粮队。随县柳林区农民，把这次公粮叫做翻身粮。因之，秋征工作中反瞒田斗争的胜利是减轻农民负担最重要的因素。而充分的运用农民代表会，控制利用旧保甲，粉碎地主恶霸的阴谋，就成为秋征工作中最重要的环节。黄陂王家河区太阳乡二保通过农民代表会，斗争了带头瞒田的大恶霸张鸿砺，即查出黑田三十多石，缴出伪乡公所枪一百八十四枝，农民在胜利鼓舞下，二天内就缴齐公粮，并自动组织五十多人的自卫队保卫仓库。
    在反瞒田斗争中各地较普遍的产生二种偏向，一种是不讲政策，不分对象，盲目的乱反，鄂城华容区有一个干部在黑板报上写：“不分穷富，瞒田者一律处罚。”孝感县十月间举行干部测验，全县百分之六十以上的干部不懂负担政策，或仅懂一般原则而不会计算负担法。另一种偏向则反映为干部缺乏前进勇气。当工作初布置时，不经调查研究，就盲目的说：“任务太重，无法完成。”当各地反瞒田运动初步开展，稍稍获得一些成绩后，又自满自足，停步不前。鄂城樊口区九保夏季征粮中，初次只报出田地八百亩，最后查至四千多亩，秋征开始时，有的干部就说：“差不多了，我们这里没有问题了。”但经过再次查田后，现在已查到八千多亩。在整个湖北省来说，地主瞒田的数量是多得惊人的，这次查出的瞒田，一般均为原报田亩数的一倍至二倍，有的地区甚至达到六、七倍。为了防止及纠正工作中的偏向，黄陂、孝感、黄冈、武昌等县在秋征工作布置以前都召开了党代表会或干部大会，检查了夏季征粮工作中政策执行的情况，对干部进行了批评和表扬，黄陂县发动了各区的竞赛，使全区任务在四十天内超额完成，都是很好的经验，但干部教育的中心一环，必须是政策思想的贯彻，否则又容易造成干部单纯为完成任务而产生的急性病。
