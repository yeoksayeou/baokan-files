    Qingdao Power Plant Launches Thrift Campaign
    Saving 1,400 Tons of Coal
    Achieving a 20% Surplus in Six Months
    [This Newspaper’s Dispatch] After preliminary implementation of democratic management, the Qingdao Power Plant has enhanced the consciousness and production enthusiasm of all its employees, continuously setting new records in the production and thrift campaign of the past six months. It has not only guaranteed the supply of power and lighting for the entire city but also accumulated a substantial amount of state capital. After Qingdao's liberation, the plant's employees immediately rushed to repair the Bai Sha River water source to Chengyang Town transmission line, which had been thoroughly destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits. Through the joint efforts of twenty-five employees, overcoming difficulties, the sixteen-<i>li</i>-long line was repaired in nineteen days. In September, the plant launched a production and thrift campaign. After mobilization by the plant director and military representative, employees of each unit held democratic discussions separately, formulated rules and plans, and established inspection teams to check the implementation progress at any time. The trade union also carried out mobilization and assurance work. As of November, the plant saved materials and utilized waste materials equivalent to approximately RMB 5,223,340, saved gasoline equivalent to RMB 784,000, and saved labor equivalent to RMB 3,181,816. The plant's water consumption has also been greatly reduced, from 1,689 kilograms of water consumed per kilowatt-hour in June to 1,086 kilograms in September, 813 kilograms in October, and 736 kilograms in November. To ensure uninterrupted power supply, the overhaul of No. 3 turbine generator began on October 13. Before liberation, each overhaul of this machine took one month. This time, the overhaul was originally planned to be completed in eighteen days and 524 work hours. Due to prior democratic discussion, detailed planning, clear division of labor, full play of employees' enthusiasm and creativity, and sufficient preparation of various materials, the overhaul work was successfully completed in twelve days and 378 work hours. In the production and thrift campaign, the leadership consciously paid attention to seeking savings from the largest consumption item – coal. The leadership initially applied democratic management, allowing the old workers and foremen of the boiler room to give preliminary play to their rich experience in coal combustion, and the coal consumption figures immediately began to decline in a curve. The average coal consumption per kilowatt-hour was 1.065 kilograms in June, 0.97 kilograms in July, 0.989 kilograms in August, 0.913 kilograms in September, 0.941 kilograms in October, and dropped to an average of 0.877 kilograms in November, breaking the record since 1943. In December, it dropped again to an average of 0.869 kilograms. On the 21st and 22nd, new records of 0.803 and 0.78 kilograms were reached. Calculated month by month, this represents a saving of 1,419 tons of coal. If calculated based on the average coal consumption of 1.011 in 1948, as much as 2,403 tons were saved by November. Since liberation, our Party, government, military, and people's organizations have all been able to pay electricity bills on time and at the prescribed price, and have cooperated in checking electricity theft and conducting anti-electricity theft education. With the strong cooperation of all parties, the plant organized an anti-electricity theft propaganda team to carry out anti-electricity theft publicity. Employees also reorganized the lines and inspected and repaired high-voltage meters, causing the monthly circuit losses to drop sharply. The loss was 31.2 percent in June and fell to 13.85 percent in November. From the perspective of the overall power supply situation, there have been no complete power outages since liberation. Industrial electricity consumption has increased month by month from 29,896 kilowatt-hours in June to more than double the original consumption in November. Due to the promotion and development of the production and thrift campaign, in addition to ensuring the city's production, construction, and domestic electricity consumption, the surplus was about 20 percent of the revenue by the end of November last year.

    青岛电厂开展节约运动
    节约燃煤千四百吨
    半年盈余百分二十
    【本报讯】青岛发电厂初步实现民主管理，提高了全体职工的觉悟与生产积极性，在半年来的生产节约运动中迭创新纪录。不仅保证供给了全市动力与灯光用电，且积累了大宗国家资本。青市解放后，该厂职工立即抢修被国民党匪帮彻底破坏了的白沙河水源地至城阳镇之输电线路，由于二十五名职工共同努力，克服困难，使全长十六华里的线路，十九天中即抢修完成。九月份，该厂掀起了生产节约运动。经厂长、军代表动员后，各单位职工分头民主讨论，定出守则和方案，并成立了检查小组，随时检查各部执行程度。工会也进行了动员保证工作。截至十一月份，全厂节省器材利用废料约合人民币五二二三三四○元，节省汽油合人民币七八四○○○元，节省人工合三一八一八一六元。全厂水耗也大大降低，六月份每千度电耗水一六八九公斤，九月份减至一○八六公斤，十月份减至八一三公斤，十一月减至七三六公斤。为保证不误供电，从十月十三日开始抢修三号汽轮发电机。解放前每次检修这部机器需时一月，此次抢修原计划用十八天五二四工完成；由于事前进行了民主讨论、详细计划、明确分工，充分发挥了职工的积极性与创造性，各种物料的准备也很充分，结果使抢修工作以十二天三七八工胜利完成。领导上在生产节约运动中，有意识的注意了从最大的消耗——燃煤中求得节约。领导上初步运用了民主管理，使锅炉房老工人、领班初步发挥了他们丰富的燃煤经验，煤耗数字顿成曲线下降之势。六月份平均每度电用煤一·○六五公斤，七月份平均○·九七公斤，八月份平均○·九八九公斤，九月份平均○·九一三公斤，十月份平均○·九四一公斤，至十一月份则降为平均○·八七七公斤，打破了一九四三年以来的纪录。十二月份再降，平均为○·八六九公斤，二十一、二两日曾达○·八○三和○·七八的新纪录。如逐月对比计算，即节省燃煤一四一九吨。如以一九四八年平均煤耗一·○一一计算，至十一月份即节省二四○三吨之多。解放以来，我党政军民各机关团体都能按时按价交纳电费，并配合检查窃电，进行反窃电教育。该厂在各方有力配合下组织了反窃电宣传队，进行了反窃电宣传。职工又整理线路，检验修理高压电表，使每月之电路损失直线下降。六月份损失百分之三一·二，十一月份降至百分之一三·八五。从整个供电情形来看，解放以来从未发生过全部停电，工业用电从六月份的二九八九六逐月增加，到十一月提高到原来用电的一倍多。由于生产节约运动的推动与开展，除保证了全市生产建设与生活用电外，至去年十一月底计算，盈余约占收入的百分之二十左右。
