On "Removing the Hat" and "Taking Off the Boots"
Ya Qun

In the past, when warlords were fighting each other for power, a certain "ism" was popular in the officialdom of southwestern China, called "remove the hat but not the boots, take off the boots but not the hat."

The specific content of this "ism" was: when I really can't beat you, I can step down, give you face, let you take over, but my strength (troops) cannot be touched, this is called "remove the hat but not the boots"; also, if my strength has been defeated by you, you must save my face, give me a certain official title, this is called "take off the boots but not the hat."

In fact, of course, it is best to "not take off the boots" and "not remove the hat"; if "one cannot have both," then "remove the hat" but "not take off the boots"; as for being willing to "take off the boots" but "not remove the hat," that is a last resort after the "boots" have actually been taken off. But, it's not purely a matter of face; under the hat, one can slowly plan to put on the "boots" again.

In the old China, warlords fought each other, "removing the hat," "taking off the boots"; "taking off the boots," "removing the hat," endlessly cycling. And the people were trampled back and forth in this "removing" and "taking off."

Some of them, though their hats had been changed to various trademarks such as "National Protection Army," "National Pacification Army," some kind of "Army," some kind of "Revolutionary Army"... the boots were genuine feudal brands.

The historical conditions for implementing this "ism" have gone forever. Today, there is no need to consider how to implement this "ism," because in the era of the people, the people have become the masters of the country. We only welcome you to put on the "hat" and "boots" made by the people for the benefit of the country and the people, to serve the people wholeheartedly. The sizes of this "hat" and "boots" are extraordinarily large. As long as you don't cling to the old hats and boots, they will fit freely and comfortably, without the worry of "removing" or "taking off."

    “揭帽”“脱靴”论
    亚群
    从前，封建军阀们你挤我，我挤你的时候，西南的官场中流行着一种“主义”，叫做“揭帽不脱靴，脱靴不揭帽”。
    这“主义”的具体内容是：实在挤不赢你的时候，我可以下台，面子给你，由你上去，但我的实力（部队）可不能动，这就叫做“揭帽不脱靴”；又，如其我的实力已被你搞垮，总得留个面子，给我一定的官衔，这就叫做“脱靴不揭帽”。
    其实呢，当然以既“不脱靴”也“不揭帽”为最好；“二者不可得兼”，则“揭帽”而“不脱靴”；至于情愿“脱靴”而“不揭帽”，那是实际上“靴”已被脱掉后没有办法的办法。但，不是单纯的面子问题，而是在帽子之下，可以徐图再穿上“靴”。
    在旧的中国，军阀混战之间，就这样“揭帽”，“脱靴”；“脱靴”，“揭帽”，循环不已。而人民就在这“揭”，“脱”之中被踩来踩去。
    他们之中有些人的帽子虽曾经更换过“护国军”，“靖国军”，什么什么“陆军”，什么什么“革命军”……各式各样的商标，而靴子则是道地的封建牌。
    实行这种“主义”的历史条件已经一去不返了，今天不必再考虑如何实行这种“主义”，因为人民的时代，人民已做了国家的主人，只欢迎你换上人民制就的利国利民的“帽子”和“靴子”，以全心全意地为人民服务。这“帽”和“靴”的尺寸是异常宽大的，只要你不迷恋旧的靴帽，就自由自在地常非适合，而无“揭”“脱”之虞。
