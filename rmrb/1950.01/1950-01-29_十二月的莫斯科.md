Moscow in December 1949 was Moscow overflowing with joyous events!

The anniversary of the Stalin Constitution on December 5th, Chairman Mao's arrival in Moscow on December 16th, Marshal Stalin's 70th birthday on December 21st… One joyous event followed another, happening in beloved Moscow. Moscow, oh, more heated than heated, more boiling than boiling… Those who were in Moscow spent the days of December with particularly excited feelings! We arrived in Moscow during this series of memorable, forever unforgettable days.

It was dusk in early December. A faint, gauze-like mist floated and moved over the tall buildings. The lights, more numerous than stars, twinkled, and from afar, they looked like countless enormous ships sailing… Everyone was dressed and had drawn back the curtains to fully appreciate this winter night scene of Moscow. Mr. Konovalov, the Soviet medical doctor traveling in the same car, suddenly said to everyone in a tone as if reciting poetry:

“Look, the faintly red lights, that's the Kremlin! Comrade Stalin is working there.”

Everyone widened their eyes, trying hard to stare at the red dot in the night sky. The car seemed to have heard his words, speeding up even faster, excitedly racing forward…

I remember that after we changed to a car, not far after turning a corner, we saw a particularly prominent character made of red mercury – M, the first letter of the subway. The slogans on both sides, decorated like gold, became clearer and clearer as we approached: Under the sun of the Stalin Constitution, advance towards Communism! Although December 5th had passed a few days ago, everything you saw gave you a feeling of festivity. Everything that was published in the newspapers, broadcasted by the radio stations day and night, seen on the streets, and talked about by people revolved around this topic, all confirming that: The Stalin Constitution is a great and glorious charter, the victorious fruit of the Soviet people's long struggle. In order to commemorate this holiday with practical actions, various factories formulated production increase competition plans. Some Stakhanovite groups (named for completing 200% of the work daily), such as "Sormovo" and "Stalin Automobile Factory," and many shock brigades and labor teams exceeded their plans. The Moscow Evening News announced that Berbasov, from the No. 3 furnace in the skilled steelworkers' team who had been awarded the Red Banner of Labor, had already begun delivering new products of 1950—chemical metals. I personally witnessed the fervent labor enthusiasm of Soviet workers requesting to do more work and voluntarily working overtime. I also saw shoe-shiners, car or elevator operators, and barbers always carrying the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or Stalin's works with them at work, to read during breaks. Every day, countless people in Moscow took their lovers or led their families to the Urals, to Leningrad, to Crimea, to the warm south to spend their annual (half a month or a month or two) vacation. Soviet citizens not only achieved complete political equality and complete equality between men and women but also truly realized and guaranteed everyone's right to work, right to rest, and right to education. When the elderly, the sick who lost their labor force, or mothers whose labor income was reduced due to having many children, also had the right to enjoy material security. I think this is why the Soviet people celebrated this holiday with such unanimous joy and excitement, and it also reminds people why the famous old singer Jambul wrote the following lines of poetry:

This Constitution brings us boundless light,
This Constitution makes the grasslands grow lush. …
This Constitution lets children grow up in happiness,
They are the happiest group under the sky.
Wise and beloved father—Stalin,
It is you! Warming the hearts of millions of people.

On the morning of December 16th, light, sparse snow was falling from the sky. Automatic snow sweepers and new snow transport machines were busily working back and forth on the streets. However, Moscow in December this year was not as cold as in previous years. The standard thermometer on Red Square read minus two and a half degrees Celsius. The lush green pines, cypresses, and lindens on both sides of the streets and in the parks rustled. People walked by in not very thick clothes. The Moscow River, which had been frozen long ago in previous years, still had a long, deep blue strip in the center of the river… These phenomena seemed to especially show the newly arrived guests: Winter has not yet arrived, Moscow in early December is as warm as spring. Perhaps this is not only due to the weather, but also the relationships between people, which are even warmer than the weather.

Moscow Radio broadcast Chinese music early in the morning, including the chorus "Singing Mao Zedong, Singing Stalin" and "Workers Have Strength" from the Chinese Youth Art Troupe's Yangge dance, and Guo Lanying's soprano solo "Women's Liberation Song." I saw a Soviet comrade next to me singing along because these tunes were no longer unfamiliar to Muscovites. That Soviet comrade told me that they loved Chinese mass songs and simple, profound folk songs very much, and many people were learning to sing them, but Chinese was difficult to learn, so sometimes they had to sing according to the recordings using Russian or English pronunciation. I said that I believed this very much and pointed out that when he said the word "er" (two), he always pronounced it with a retroflex "P," which made him laugh.

Like the craze for learning Russian in Beijing, many Soviet comrades in Moscow were also learning Chinese. Chinese grammar has many unscientific aspects, but they would come up with many methods you wouldn't expect to overcome the difficulties, and this learning spirit could not but be admired. I remembered that once when I was buying books on Pushkin Street, a female staff member took out a piece of snow-white drawing paper from her pocket with a few neat Chinese characters written on it like a design—Stalin—Mao Zedong.

“Is it right, Chinese comrade!” she asked me.

“Very good! You wrote it in printed form,” I said.

She didn’t quite understand the Chinese for the three words "printed form." She took out a book, which contained Chairman Mao’s "On the People’s Democratic Dictatorship," Comrade Liu Shaoqi’s "Internationalism and Nationalism," and some scattered "Northeast Pictorials." It turned out that she wrote it according to the words printed in the book. That was how much effort it took to write so neatly and clearly.

The snow stopped falling, and the road was as bright and shiny as a mirror. Suddenly, I heard a pleasant surprise on the way—Chairman Mao had arrived in Moscow.

When the radio officially broadcast the news, we had just finished watching the color film "World Youth." There we saw that when a huge, exquisitely made embroidered portrait of Chairman Mao was held high by members of the Chinese youth delegation as they walked through the venue, the surrounding crowd cheered enthusiastically: Mao Zedong—Hurrah! Mao Zedong—Hurrah! The Soviets watching the movie next to us cast respectful glances, warm smiles, or pointed at us and said: Chinese!—Mao Zedong!

As soon as I opened the door, I heard Chairman Mao’s speech at the station coming from the radio, with that familiar Hunan accent: “…I have the opportunity to visit Moscow, the capital of the world’s first great socialist country, which is a very pleasant thing in my life.”

Mao Zedong—this symbol of the Chinese people’s happiness and victory—has long been loved and familiar to the Soviet people. As early as during the ten years of civil war, during the days of the 25,000-mile Long March across the snowy mountains and grasslands; during the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, during the difficult days in Yan'an; in the recent three years of the War of Liberation, when he commanded thousands of troops to finally eliminate the reactionary forces at home and abroad… Today, just as the Soviet people across the country were joyously celebrating the 70th birthday of Comrade Stalin, the world revolutionary teacher, just as Moscow in early December was as warm as spring, Chairman Mao came, bringing victory, bringing the hopes and will of the entire Chinese people!

The next day, the front pages of all Soviet newspapers carried the headline news that Chairman Mao had arrived in Moscow and met with Marshal Stalin. The eight-inch photo on the front page of Pravda made Chairman Mao's image even more unforgettable: a stalwart body, broad shoulders, wearing a long leather coat, wearing a tall fur hat, a kind face full of joy, taking slow steps with Comrades Molotov and Bulganin out of the platform… Many famous Stakhanovite workers in Moscow also welcomed this most distinguished guest of the Soviet people from afar with boundless excitement.

The news of Chairman Mao's arrival in Moscow became the center of everyone's conversation. Once, when I was looking at the Moscow Evening News at the entrance of Moscow University, several college students pulled me in to see their "Mao Zedong Wall Newspaper." One of them, named Andreyev, told me that they had published it voluntarily, because not long ago, they studied "The Biography of Mao Zedong" and listened to a report. He especially mentioned that not long ago Markov (a member of the Soviet cultural and artistic workers delegation to China last October, and a representative of the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association) conveyed in his report Chairman Mao's thanks and respect to the Soviet people and Comrade Stalin. "We were extremely happy to hear it! It's a pity that we know too little about Mao Zedong," he said regretfully. In fact, there was quite a lot written on the wall newspaper, and I had never seen some of the photos before. Finally, he said: "I wish you happiness, having a leader like Mao Zedong… We wrote to him not long ago to congratulate him on being elected Chairman of the People's Government and sent it to Beijing. I wonder if it was received?" I replied with a smile: "It will definitely be received. Yes, the Chinese people have a way with Comrade Mao Zedong, just as the people of the world have a way with Comrade Stalin.”

Not long ago, I heard some Soviet comrades say, and also read in magazines, that many people wrote letters to Chairman Mao, including college students, middle school students, pilots, and ordinary workers. I remember a middle school girl in Siberia wrote an article, saying that one day, just as they were in history class, news came that the Central Government of the People's Republic of China was established, so teachers and students cheered endlessly, so happy that they could not continue the class. Naturally, everyone was talking about China. The history class turned into a discussion on China, and they unanimously passed a resolution to write a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in the name of all comrades, and sent Chairman Mao a package of Michurin apple seeds. Five students also wrote to Chairman Mao asking for his photo.

Oh, dear little comrades in Siberia! Comrades of the entire Soviet Union! Today—December 16, 1949, Mao Zedong, who you are concerned about and respected, has arrived in Moscow! And is with Comrade Stalin!
            ×       ×       ×      ×
“Happy holidays, comrade!”
“Happy holidays, comrade!”
“Wish Comrade Stalin eternal health!”

Today is December 21st, a day that everyone in Moscow will never forget in their lives. Everything is like a holiday scene. People meet on the road and greet each other warmly, offering blessings. The streets are cleaned so neatly and brightly, the entrances everywhere are decorated so colorfully and beautifully, and people look so cheerful and beaming. Stalin's various portraits are posted everywhere, red flags are waving all over the streets, and songs are flying… The entire Moscow is cheering and celebrating dear Stalin's 70th birthday!

On this day, I saw almost everyone holding a copy of the ten-page special edition of Pravda, like unfolding banners. People read it with the greatest joy. On the first page, the headline was marked with copper coin-sized characters: Stalin's name—is the most beloved name of the people of our motherland and all sincere people in the world. Stalin's name—is a symbol of the future victory of communism. The loving hearts of the Soviet people and hundreds of millions of workers around the world are inclined to you—great Stalin!

On this day, the broadcasters of Moscow Radio, with particularly excited voices, continued their work that had lasted for more than a month, day and night, as if it would never end—reporting on the situation of congratulatory letters and birthday gifts from all over the Soviet Union and the world to Comrade Stalin. Gifts filled the Lenin Museum, the Museum of the Revolution, and the Pushkin National Museum, but gifts from various countries and nations were being transported to Moscow by trains, cars, planes, and ships every moment.

In the gift exhibition, I saw the people's most sincere hearts and unparalleled love for the leader. I saw the various latest electrical models sent by the Soviet republics, trackless radio cars, electric trains, electric tractors, giant electric cranes (1150 tons, used for digging canals) … This shows that under the light of Stalin, the Soviet Union is advancing towards an electrified communist society.

I saw 3,765 different varieties of excellent crop seeds sent by Ukrainian collective farms. These are the fruits harvested under the painstaking cultivation of Comrade Stalin.

I saw seventy women from the Russian Republic weaving a large tapestry for an entire year, fourteen or five feet long and wide. The surrounding of the large tapestry had exquisite colorful flags of the sixteen republics and the specialties and landscapes of each republic. In the middle was a giant statue of Stalin. There I saw the old Siberian craftsman Kamrin, carving a set of works based on the famous fairy tale "The Good Old Man," which took him thirty-seven years. He wrote: I turned my youth into "The Good Old Man" and gave it to my father and best friend Stalin!

I saw, oh, I saw that in the foreign gift exhibition room, the first room was for Chinese gifts! Under the fluttering Five-Star Red Flag, was a longevity hall sent by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Chairman Mao’s own handwriting: May your happiness be as boundless as the East Sea and your life as long as the Southern Mountain. On both sides were embroidered portraits of Comrade Stalin, ivory towers, dragons, ships, and a particularly eye-catching three- or four-foot-high ivory ancient vase, with delicate landscapes, mountains and forests carved on the vase.

I also saw the commemorative album of five large gold-edged volumes signed by more than four million people from Bulgaria; saw one of the countless gifts from the Polish people: a nimble shotgun—Stalin is a sharpshooter with perfect aim! The beasts cannot escape; saw a French martyr's mother, who gave Stalin the only memento her son had left for many years: a jade and gold medal, so that all French sons would not participate in the war against the Soviet Union; there was also a French female guerrilla who was maimed by the German Kou, who made a piece of clothing with fingerless hands and sent it to Stalin, so that the god of peace—Stalin would live forever. I saw the bronze statue sent by the Hungarian people: a loving mother carrying a baby. Comrade Stalin is carrying the people towards happiness.

I saw, oh, I saw thousands and thousands of letters congratulating Stalin on his birthday, which were also letters swearing allegiance to him! A letter from Africa, folded with full of marks and water spots after climbing mountains and crossing waters and sailing tens of thousands of miles, read: "Our bodies are far away from you, but our hearts are close to you. It is the supreme pride and glory for the people of the world to have a leader like you. On your seventieth birthday, we guarantee to you that we African people will further strengthen our opposition to the imperialist policy of aggression and fight for world peace…“

In each gift exhibition room, there were people specially assigned to explain the gifts. They had a good understanding of each gift, so they explained it in great detail. There were opinion books on the table, where people wrote down their thoughts in various languages. I also saw it written in Chinese—

The people's gifts, the people's hearts,
Sent to Moscow, to Stalin.
Sincere hope, sincere affection,
May you live ten thousand years, great Stalin!

The clock of the Kremlin is striking seven, an active night has begun! A hot night has begun!

People will always remember in their hearts, the Moscow night scene of December 21st! The open-air concerts and open-air movies in the central square, Pushkin Square, Svetlov and other squares! When the loudspeaker broadcast the music of "Song of the Heart—Song of Stalin" and "Moscow Victory Night," people began to cheer. Many people naturally started dancing. I saw the black and dark American Embassy in the eastern corner of the Central Square (former Manege Square), which looked so dim and dull under the unparalleled bright electric lights and in the victorious cheers!

Always remember in the heart, always remember in the heart, that the heart of Moscow, the heart of the world tonight—the State Moscow Grand Theater! The theater gate surrounded by crowds illuminated by many mercury lights, the Stalin full-body statue more than four feet high painted by the great artist Hamilgo, the chariot pulled by five black-bronze warhorses running on the roof of the theater! The large characters composed of countless colored electric lights that flicker and attract people to look up for a long time: Great Stalin—Eternal Glory! The portraits of Stalin’s comrades-in-arms hung next to the theater—Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Khrushchev, Bulganin, Shvernik, Kosygin, Suslov, Ponomarlin—! The moving scene of the unparalleled grand birthday ceremony in the theater—sitting under the twenty-six flame-like red flags of the republics, sitting in the midst of tens of thousands of flowers, surrounded by his glorious partners—the leaders of the brotherly parties of various countries, the representatives of the people's democratic countries and the best children of the Soviet people, the organizer and inspirer of the victory of communism, Comrade Stalin’s kind image, and when this image appeared, the whole audience burst into a burst of applause like a hurricane-like thunderstorm. At this time, I felt that the workers in New York, the workers in London, the victorious people in China, the people fighting hard in Greece, and all pure people who love peace in the world, their hearts are inclined to Moscow, and their hearts are excitedly beating for their friends and mentors. I heard the applause and cheers like endless tides roaring: Stalin! Stalin! Stalin! …

Always remember in the heart, always remember in the heart, when our Chairman Mao appeared on the glorious stage full of joy, when our Chairman Mao sat with Comrade Stalin, when the chairman announced that the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China Mao Zedong was about to speak, the audience could not help but utter a cry of excitement, enthusiasm and respect——The Chinese People——Mao Zedong! The Chinese People——Mao Zedong!

Chairman Mao's congratulatory speech was short words, long feelings, calm voice, and profound meaning. The famous Soviet poet Tikhonov described it as: Mao Zedong's calm voice brought the breath of the vast people of the East into the venue. …

Every sentence of Chairman Mao’s speech was interrupted by stormy applause. When Chairman Mao shouted, "Long live the leader of the world working class and the international communist movement—the great Stalin!" everyone stood up again for a long time, raising their hands to applaud and cheer! At this time, it was 9:05 pm Moscow time and 3:10 am Beijing time. The comrades and friends in our beloved motherland are in quiet sleep. Oh, the heart of the motherland, Beijing, did you hear Chairman Mao’s speech in the Moscow Grand Theater, in front of the representatives of the people of the world, beside Comrade Stalin? Applaud! Cheer! Oh! Motherland, Beijing…

    十二月的莫斯科
    朱子奇
    一九四九年十二月的莫斯科是喜事重重的莫斯科！
    十二月五号斯大林宪法纪念日，十二月十六号毛主席到莫斯科，十二月二十一号斯大林大元帅七十大寿……接二连三的喜事发生着，发生在亲爱的莫斯科。莫斯科呵，热烈中加热烈，沸腾里更加沸腾起来……十二月的日子，在莫斯科的人是以特别激动的心情度过的！我们就在这串可纪念的永远难忘的日子里到达莫斯科。
    那是十二月初的一个黄昏，淡淡的轻纱似的夜雾在高大的建筑物上飘浮着，游动着，比星星还多的电灯光闪烁着，远远看去，活像无数只巨大的海船在航行……大家都穿好了衣服撩开窗布在尽情欣赏这冬日的莫斯科夜景。那位同车的苏联名医学博士哥诺瓦乐夫忽然用朗诵诗一般的调子对人们说：
    “看呀，那隐隐发红的灯火，就是克里姆宫呵！斯大林同志就在那里办公。”
    大家都睁大着眼睛努力地盯着那夜空中的红点，车子也仿佛听见了他的话，快中加快，兴奋地奔驰着……
    我记得当我们换上汽车后，在转弯不远的地方就看到了一个特别明显的用红色水银制成的字——Ｍ，那是地下铁道的头一个字母，那两旁装饰得如同黄金似的标语愈近愈清楚：在斯大林宪法的太阳下，向共产主义前进！虽然十二月五号已过去几天了，但所见到的一切总是使你有一种节日的感觉，各报所登的，广播电台日夜所播送的，街上所见到的，人们嘴里所谈论的都围绕着这个题目，都证实着：斯大林宪法是伟大的光辉的大宪章，是苏联人民长期斗争的胜利果实。为了用实际行动来纪念这个节日，各工厂制定了增产竞赛计划，有的工厂中的斯达哈诺夫——百分之二百运动者小组（以每日完成百分之二百的工作而得名），如“索尔莫”和“斯大林汽车工厂”很多突击组，劳动班都超过计划；莫斯科晚报宣布：曾得过红旗英雄章的熟练钢铁工人班中的第三号炉的别尔巴索夫已开始交新的——１９５０年的产品——化学金属。我亲眼看见苏联工作人员要求多做工作自动加夜班的火热的劳动热忱，我又看见擦皮鞋的工人和开汽车或开电梯、理发的工人在工作时身边总是带着联共党史或者斯大林的著作，好利用空隙看书；莫斯科每日都有无数的人带着自己的爱人或领着一家大小到乌拉尔，到列宁格勒，到克里米亚，到温暖的南方去度每人每年一度的（半个月或一两个月的）休息期。苏联公民不但做到政治上完全平等，男女完全平等，还真正实现了和保证了人人有劳动权，休息权和受教育权，当年老人以及患病丧失了劳动力和因母亲生小孩多减少了劳动收入降低时，也有享受物质保证之权，我想这也就是为什么苏联人民那样全体一致地欢欣鼓舞地来庆祝这个节日，同时也叫人想起为什么那个有名的老歌手江布尔写下面几句诗的原因：
    这宪法，给我们带来了无比光亮，
    这宪法，使草原繁茂地生长。……
    这宪法，让孩子们成长在幸福中，
    他们呵，是天底下最快乐的一群。
    贤明的，亲爱的父亲——斯大林，
    是你！温暖着千万人民的心。
         ×       ×       ×      ×
    十二月十六号早晨，天空飘着稀稀的小雪，自动扫雪车和新式运雪机在街道上来回忙碌着。但今年的十二月的莫斯科，却并不像往年那样寒冷。红场上的标准温度表指着零下二度半，街道两旁和公园里的绿油油的松柏和菩提树沙沙响着，人们穿着不很厚的服装走过去，那往年早已冻结了的莫斯科河，现在在河中心还留着一条长长的深蓝色的带子……这些现象仿佛特别给新来的客人显示着：冬天并未来临，十二月初的莫斯科是温暖如春呵。也许这不仅仅是由于天气的缘故，还有比天气更使人感到暖和的人与人的关系。
    莫斯科广播电台一早就播送着中国音乐，中国青年文工团的合唱大秧歌舞中的“歌唱毛泽东、歌唱斯大林”和“咱们工人有力量”，郭兰英的女高音独唱“妇女解放歌”，我看见旁边一位苏联同志跟着唱起来，因为这些调子对于莫斯科人已不是生疏的了，那位苏联同志对我说，他们很喜爱中国的群众歌曲和朴实深厚的民歌，有不少人在学唱，只是中国话不好学，有时只好根据录音用俄文或英文的发音来唱。我说我很相信这点，并举出他说“二”字时总是带卷舌音“Ｐ”的，他听了大笑起来。
    像北京学俄文的热潮一样，莫斯科也有不少苏联同志在学中文，中文语法存在着许多不科学的地方，但他们会想出许多你想不到的办法来克服困难，这种学习精神叫人不能不钦佩。我想起有一次在普希金大街买书时，一个女工作人员从口袋里掏出一张雪白的图画纸上面像图案似的写着几个整齐的中国字——斯大林——毛泽东。
    “对不对，中国同志！”她问我。
    “很好！你写的是印刷体。”我说。
    印刷体三个字的中文她听不大懂，她取出一卷书来，里面是毛主席的《论人民民主专政》，刘少奇同志的《国际主义与民族主义》和一些零星的《东北画报》，原来她是按书上印的字写的，那是经过多少努力才能写得这般端正和清楚呵。
    雪不落了，马路又像镜子似的光亮亮的。忽然在半路上听见了一个惊喜的消息——毛主席来到莫斯科了。
    广播电台正式播送出这个消息时，我们正看完五彩影片《世界青年》回来，在那里我们看到当巨大的精制的毛主席绣像由中国青年代表团的团员们高举着走过会场时，四周的人群热烈欢呼：毛泽东——乌拉！毛泽东——乌拉！旁边看电影的苏联人都向我们投以敬意的眼光，亲切的微笑，或指着我们说：中国人！——毛泽东！
    开开房门就听到了由广播机传来的，毛主席在车站上的讲演，那熟悉的湖南音调：“……我这次获有机会访问世界上第一个伟大社会主义国家苏联的首都，是生平很愉快的事。”
    毛泽东——这中国人民幸福的象征和胜利的名字，早为苏联人民所敬爱和熟悉，那还是在十年内战的时候，在二万五千里长征过雪山草地的日子；在八年抗战中，在艰苦的延安的日子；在最近三年解放战争中，在他指挥着千军万马最后消灭国内外的反动派的日子……今天呵，正当苏联人民举国一致欢天喜地庆祝世界革命导师斯大林同志七十大寿的前夕，正当十二月初的莫斯科温暖如春的日子，毛主席来了，带着胜利，带着全中国人民的希望和意志来了！
    第二天苏联各报第一版大标题都登载着毛主席抵莫斯科和斯大林大元帅会见毛主席的消息，真理报第一版上八寸大的像片上那更使人难忘毛主席的形象：魁巍的身躯，宽大的肩膀，穿着长长的皮大衣，戴着高高的皮帽子，和蔼的面孔充满喜悦，迈着缓慢的步子伴着莫洛托夫和布尔加宁同志走出月台……莫斯科许多有名的斯达哈诺夫工作者也带着无限的兴奋去欢迎这位远道来的苏联人民最高贵的上宾。
    毛主席到莫斯科的消息成了每个人谈话的中心。有一次我在莫斯科大学校门口看《莫斯科晚报》，有几个大学生拉我进去看他们的“毛泽东墙报”，其中有个叫安德烈夫的，他告诉我这是他们自动出的，因为不久前，他们学习了《毛泽东传》又听了报告，他特别提到不久前马尔柯夫（去年十月到中国的苏联文化艺术工作者代表团的团员，苏联对外文化协会的代表）在报告中转达了毛主席给苏联人民和斯大林同志的感谢和敬意，“我们听了高兴极了！只可惜关于毛泽东，我们知道得太少”，他遗憾地说。其实墙报上写的并不算少，有些像片，我也从来没有见过的。最后他说：“祝你们幸福，有毛泽东这样的领袖……我们不久前给他写信道喜，祝他当选人民政府主席，寄到北京的，不知收到了吗？”我笑着回答：“一定会收到的。是的，中国人民有了毛泽东同志就有办法了，正像世界人民有了斯大林同志就有办法一样。”
    不久前，听有些苏联同志说过，也在杂志上读到过不少人给毛主席写信的事，有大学生，中学生，有飞机师和普通工人。我记得西伯利亚有个中学的女生写过一篇文章，她说有一天，正当他们在上历史课的时候，忽然传来中华人民共和国中央政府成立的消息，于是教员学生一起欢呼不止，高兴得课也不能继续上了，自自然然地你一言我一语历史课变成了中国问题的讨论会，并且一致通过了一项决议，当时就用全体同志的名义写信给中国共产党中央道喜，送给毛主席一包米秋林的苹果种，又有五个学生写信给毛主席要他的像片。
    呵，亲爱的西伯利亚的小同志！全苏联的同志们！今天——一九四九年十二月十六号，你们所关怀和敬爱的毛泽东已来到莫斯科了！和斯大林同志在一起了！
            ×       ×       ×      ×
    “过节好呵，同志！”
    “过节好呵，同志！”
    “祝斯大林同志永远健康！”
    今天是十二月二十一号，是在莫斯科的每个人一生不会忘记的一天。一切都是过节时的情景，人们在路上相见互相亲切地问候着，祝福着。街道是打扫得那样整洁光亮，各处的大门口是布置得那样鲜艳漂亮，人们是显得那样喜气洋洋，到处贴满了斯大林的各种画像，满街红旗招展，歌声飞扬……整个的莫斯科在为亲爱的斯大林的七十大寿而欢欣鼓舞！
    这天我看见几乎每个人的手里都拿着一份十版特大号的真理报，好像展开一面面锦旗似的，人们用最大的喜悦来读它，第一版报头上标着铜钱大的字：斯大林的名字——是我们祖国人民的和全世界一切真诚人们的最亲爱的名字。斯大林的名字——这是共产主义未来胜利的象征。苏联人民和全球千百万劳动者的充满热爱的心，倾向你——伟大的斯大林！
    这天，莫斯科广播电台的广播员，用特别激动的声音来继续他们一个多月来日日夜夜的，好像永远播送不完的工作——报告全苏和全世界人民给斯大林同志的贺信和寿礼的情形。礼物摆满了列宁博物馆、革命博物馆、普希金国家博物馆，但来自各个国家各个民族的礼物，每时每刻都在用火车、汽车、飞机、轮船向莫斯科运送着。
    在礼物展览会里，我看见了人民对领袖最真诚的心和无可比喻的爱。我看见苏联各共和国送的各种最新式的，电气模型、无轨无线电车、电火车、电拖拉机、巨型电动起重机（１１５０吨，开运河用的。）……这显示着：在斯大林的光芒下，苏联正向电气化的共产主义社会前进。
    我看见了乌克兰集体农庄送的３７６５样不同的优良的农作物选种，这是斯大林同志苦心培养下收获的果实。
    我看见了俄罗斯共和国七十位妇女织了整整一年的长宽十四五丈的大壁毯，大壁毯的周围有精制的五彩的十六面共和国的国旗和各共和国的特产与景致，中间是斯大林的巨像。在那里我看见西伯利亚老艺匠卡木铃，根据有名的童话《好老人》的故事，前后花费了三十七年的时间雕刻成的一套作品，他自己写道：我把自己的青春化为“好老人”送给父亲和最好的朋友斯大林！
    我看见了呵，看见了在外国礼物展览室里第一室就是中国的礼品！在五星红旗飘扬的下面，是中共中央送的寿堂，毛主席的亲笔字：福如东海，寿比南山。两边是斯大林同志的绣像，象牙塔、龙、船和特别引人注意的三四尺高的象牙古瓶，瓶上刻有细致的山水、树林。
    我也看见了保加利亚五十大厚本金边镶成的四百多万人签名的纪念册；看见了波兰人民无数礼物中的一样：灵巧的鸟枪——斯大林是百发百中的神枪手！野兽们逃不掉；看见了法国的一位烈士的母亲，她把儿子留下多年的唯一纪念品：玉石金牌，送给斯大林，让一切法国的儿子不参加对苏联作战；又有一位被德寇打坏了手的残废了的法兰西女游击队员，她用没有指头的手制成一件衣服送给斯大林，让和平之神——斯大林永生。我看见了匈牙利人民送的铜像：慈母背婴儿。斯大林同志背着人民向幸福走去。
    我看见了呵，看见了千封万封给斯大林拜寿的信，这也是向他宣誓的信！一封从非洲捎来的，爬山过水，经过数万里航程的摺叠得满纸痕迹和水点斑斑的信上写道：“我们身子离你远，心却靠你近，世界人民有像你这样的领袖，是他们无上的骄傲和光荣。在你七十寿辰的时候，向你保证：我们非洲人民将进一步加强反对帝国主义侵略政策，为世界和平斗争。……”
    在每间礼物展览室里都派有专门解释礼物的人，他们对每件礼物都有很好的研究，因此讲解得非常详细，桌子上放着意见簿，人们用各种文字在上面写下自己的感想，在上面我也看见了用中文写的——
    人民的礼物，人民的心，
    送到莫斯科，送给斯大林。
    真诚的希望，真诚的情，
    愿你万万岁，伟大斯大林！
    克里姆宫的钟声响着七点，活跃的夜开始了！火热的夜开始了！
    人们永记在心，那十二月二十一号的莫斯科夜景！在那中央广场，普希金广场，斯维特洛夫等广场的露天音乐会和露天电影！当扩音机播送出“心之歌——斯大林之歌”和“莫斯科胜利之夜”的音乐片时，人们就开始欢呼起来，有许多人就自自然然的跳起舞来，我看见在中央广场（旧练马场）东边角落里的黑洞洞的美国大使馆，在这光明无比的电灯光下，在这胜利的欢呼声中，显得多么暗淡无光！
    永记在心呵，永记在心呵，那今晚世界心脏的莫斯科心脏——国立莫斯科大剧院！那多少水银灯光照亮着的被人群包围着的剧院门前，那大艺术家哈密尔戈画的四丈多高的斯大林全身像，那剧院房顶上黑铜色的五匹战马拉着的奔跑着的马车！那由无数彩色电灯组成的闪动着的引人抬头久久观望的大字：伟大的斯大林——永远光荣！那剧院旁边挂着的斯大林的战友们——莫洛托夫，马林科夫，贝利亚，伏洛希罗夫，卡冈诺维奇，米高扬，赫鲁舍切夫，布尔加宁，什维尔尼克，柯西金，苏斯洛夫，波诺马林科——的画像！那剧院内隆重无比的大寿礼的动人场面呵——坐在二十六面火焰似的各共和国的红旗下的，坐在万朵鲜花丛中的被自己光荣的伙伴们——各国兄弟党的领袖们，各人民民主国家的代表们和苏联人民最优秀的儿女们所围绕着的共产主义胜利的组织者和鼓舞者斯大林同志可亲的形象，和这个形象出现时，全场爆发出一阵连接一阵的狂风似的雷雨似的鼓掌声，这时，我觉得万里重洋外的纽约的工人，伦敦的工人，中国胜利的人民，希腊苦斗中的人民，世上一切爱好和平的纯洁的人们，他们的心都倾向莫斯科，他们的心在为自己的朋友和导师而兴奋地跳动着，我听见了永不断的海潮似的鼓掌声和欢呼声轰响着：斯大林！斯大林！斯大林！……
    永记在心呵，永记在心呵，当我们的毛主席出现在那光荣满堂欢乐飞舞的主席团台上，当我们的毛主席和斯大林同志坐在一起的时候，当主席宣布中国共产党领袖中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东致词，这话还未报告完的时候，台下就不由自主地发出一阵激动的充满热忱与敬意的喊声——中国人民——毛泽东！中国人民——毛泽东！
    毛主席的祝词是短短的话，长长的感情，沈静的声音，深厚的意义，苏联名诗人吉洪诺夫描写为：毛泽东平静的声音，把辽远的东方人民的呼吸带进了会场。……
    毛主席所讲的每一段话都被暴风雨的掌声打断，当毛主席高呼：“全世界工人阶级和国际共产主义运动的领袖——伟大的斯大林万岁！”的时候全体起立又是长久的举手鼓掌和欢呼！这时正是莫斯科时间晚间九点五分钟是北京的午夜三点十分钟，亲爱的祖国的同志们和朋友们正在安静的睡眠中，祖国的心脏北京呵，你听见了毛主席在莫斯科大剧院，在世界人民代表们的面前，在斯大林同志身旁的讲话吗？鼓掌吧！欢呼吧！呵！祖国呀，北京呀……
                                  一九五○年一月二号  莫斯科
