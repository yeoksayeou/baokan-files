    A Visit to the Lenin Museum
    ——Written in Commemoration of Lenin's Death
    Li Bozhao
    I was eating a bowl of fresh and delicious cabbage soup when the chairman of the Ilyich Collective Farm gently tapped me and whispered:
    "The third old man to the right of your shoulder was once punished by Comrade Lenin!"
    I carefully observed this tall old man, about sixty years old, sitting not far from me. He had broad shoulders and even sitting down he was a head taller than others. He was vigorously cutting a piece of cooked beef in his soup plate.
    "Was the mistake a big one?"
    "Not small!"
    "Can you tell me what mistake he made?"
    "He cut down a tree and chopped it into firewood to burn in the stove. Lenin couldn't forgive him for that. At the time, he was the person taking care of Lenin's daily life. Now he is the caretaker at the Lenin Museum, and he is sixty-seven years old this year. You can ask him about it later, and he will tell you about this 'glorious history' of being scolded. Lenin shouted at him:
    'You undisciplined person! Have you forgotten that cutting down a tree belonging to the people is against the law?'
    'Chopping firewood to make a fire, isn't it for your warmth!' he thought at the time, feeling unconvinced.
    'For me? I'd rather freeze to death than infringe on the interests of the people for warmth. I told you, I have a coat to wear when I'm cold, I don't need you to worry about it. You obediently sit in a dark room for two or three days, and your problem of violating discipline will be cured.'
    He accepted Lenin's criticism and has been working very well ever since."
    After the meal, I was immediately accompanied by the chairman of the collective farm to visit the Lenin Museum. The tour guide drew everyone's attention: this is where Stalin and Lenin often met. Lenin lived in this house in 1918, directing the construction of socialism. Lenin's famous work, *The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky*, was written here.
    The Lenin Museum is a solemn and exquisite building in Gorki, surrounded by forests and with a large pond in front of the house where you can go boating. The original owner of the house was named Morozova, she was the widow of a famous Moscow capitalist. After the revolution, this property was nationalized.
    After Lenin gave a speech at the Mikhelson factory and was seriously wounded by a counter-revolutionary assassination attempt, he quickly resumed work. When doctors allowed him to work, his left hand was still in a bandage. At the same time, the doctors instructed him to live in the countryside. On September 25, 1918, he moved to Gorki.
    In the largest living room, there are displays of all the materials on the construction of the Soviet state organs. It can be seen that from the birth of the Russian proletarian dictatorship, Lenin and Stalin carefully studied the form of the political power organization in each period of the Russian revolution. Only by closely connecting with the masses and having a rational political power organization can it have the real ability to both suppress counter-revolutionaries and build a socialist economy.
    Lenin's telephone room was a place that Lenin liked to go to and often worked. He was reluctant to leave Moscow because the Party, the government, and the people were there. But he had to obey the doctor's orders and live in Gorki. A long-distance telephone line was set up from Moscow to Gorki. He loved the telephone as a means of communication like a lover, because the telephone in his hand made him happy by the role it played. He could use it to instruct the work of the government. Late at night, he could talk to Comrade Stalin to his heart's content, exchanging opinions on various issues, and talk to the Party newspaper, dictating his articles on the telephone. The telephone was "old-fashioned" and the sound was not good. Lenin made a request:
    "Please add a loudspeaker! Increase the volume so that I can work better!"
    Lenin could not leave the telephone room. In 1922-23, the weather was cold, and it cost a lot of firewood to heat the big house. Lenin slept in a small room, using a small fire for warmth. The telephone room was not heated, and he always wore a coat to answer the phone. When he was not sick, he simply worked in the telephone room.
    After the end of the civil war, Lenin personally led the economic construction. The rural economy suffered great damage. He carefully studied the sentiments, demands, and wishes of the Russian peasants at that time. On January 8, 1921, he met with farmers from the suburbs and talked with them in depth about oxen, farm implements, seeds, etc. The farmers suggested to Lenin:
    "You care about us, and we care about you too. How about you come and take a look at our place?" Lenin went to the countryside on the morning of the 9th. He summoned nearby farmers and held a small open-air lecture, patiently reporting the international and domestic situation to more than three hundred farmers, explaining how to get out of difficulties and how to restore and develop the rural economy. The farmers asked Lenin:
    "Dear Lenin, let us have 'electrification', we have no lights!" Lenin made a suggestion to the government, and in May 1923, Gorki was installed with electric wires, and the nearby villages were lit with electric lights. All the villages sent congratulatory letters to Lenin. Lenin lived in Gorki and wrote two pamphlets in a short time: *Once Again on the Trade Unions, the Current Situation and the Mistakes of Trotsky and Bukharin* and *The Role and Functions of the Trade Unions Under the New Economic Policy*. Fully explaining that trade unions are schools of communism.
    Walking into Lenin's library, it is full of books of various languages, hardcovers, paperbacks, mimeographs, and manuscripts. The shelves are full of books that have been used. The people who organized the books have never moved them, keeping them exactly as they were when he was alive. There are bookmarks inside the books in the bookcase. The person who took care of him said that he often buried himself in searching for materials all day long, and even forgot to eat. In the summer of 1922, the doctor examined him and knew that Lenin was overworking his brain and damaging his health, and advised him to rest, and not to receive guests and friends for a period of time. At the end of July, there was a slight improvement, and the doctor only allowed Stalin to meet with him once. It was not until the end of summer that his health was fully restored. He was free to go to the park for walks. Lenin loved children very much in his life, and his nephew and the daughter of a female worker became indispensable companions in his life. He called them "babies!" He lovingly held their little hands and walked around in the woods. The places where they played and the chairs they sat on are all circled with red rope. To please the children, he was like a big child, spending Arbor Day with them. When the children loosened the soil with small shovels and planted the saplings, they laughed happily. He was happier than the children.
    Lenin's life was simple and plain. He liked to hunt, believing that hunting was the most suitable rest. Siberian farmers carried deerskin shoes and lightweight military binoculars from afar for him. Lenin often sent the hunted wild animals to nearby state-owned farms as specimens. Suburban farmers often gave back the harvested crops to Lenin. He was very strict with himself. To go from the office to his bedroom, he had to go up the stairs. A handrail was specially installed next to the stairs, because in his later years his legs were weak. If someone served him and helped him up the stairs, he would get angry:
    "Don't leave any pair of working hands empty, use them for useful things, to restore the country's economic construction."
    On the second floor, a veranda facing south was where Lenin often went. On summer evenings, he and his wife, Krupskaya, would lie on lounge chairs to rest. He met Stalin on the veranda many times. The popular photo of Lenin and Stalin together was taken during a casual conversation on the veranda. His bedroom was even simpler, with a bed, two low stools, a small table, and a bookcase. Medicine bottles were placed on the small table by the window, and a cane leaned against the table. The tour guide sighed deeply, staring at the two thin books on the table. She said with tears in her eyes: "There is no one in the world who can compare to him, working and studying hard for the cause of communism until he stopped breathing!" She said more heavily: "Lenin was still diligently studying *On the Significance of Militant Materialism* and the novel *Love and Life* two days before his death. Originally, the doctor diagnosed that his health could slowly recover. Suddenly, unexpectedly, at 6:50 in the morning on January 21, 1924, Lenin died of cerebral hemorrhage, bidding farewell to us forever." The whole room was silent. I don't remember how I walked out of the Lenin Museum.
    On the morning of January 23, the people guarding the coffin included Kalinin, Mikoyan, Molotov, and Dimitrov. The accompanying procession was sent directly to Gerasimova, and arrived in Moscow at 1 pm. The coffin was placed in the House of Trade Unions. The weather was very cold, but people braved the icy cold and desperately squeezed forward to bid farewell to the revolutionary father. Finally, the tour guide ended her speech.
    When leaving, I seemed to see the back of the tall old man who had taken care of Lenin. I chased straight along the road, but I don't know when he walked away, and I could never find him again. The chairman of the farm sent us to the car.
                                            January 18

    记列宁博物馆
    ——为列宁逝世纪念而作
    李伯钊
    我正在吃着新鲜可口的白菜汤，依里奇集体农场的主席轻轻的拍我一下，并悄悄的说：
    “挨着你右肩数过去第三个老人，曾经受过列宁同志的处罚！”
    我细细观察了这位离我坐位不远，年约六十余岁高大的老人，宽肩，坐着也比人高一头。正用劲在汤盘里切一块熟牛肉。
    “错误犯的很大吗？”
    “不小！”
    “可以告诉我他犯了什么错误吗？”
    “他砍断一棵树，劈成柴来烧火炉，就为这个，列宁不能饶恕他。当时他是为列宁照料生活的人。现在就在列宁博物馆，当管事员，今年六十七岁了。待会你问他好了，他会对你讲这段挨骂的‘光荣历史’的。列宁大声的嚷他：
    ‘不守纪律的人：你忘掉了砍老百姓一棵树是犯法的吗？’
    ‘劈柴生炉子，还不是为你取暖！’他心里当时不服气。
    ‘为我？为着取暖侵犯老百姓利益，我宁可冻死。我告诉过你，我冷我有大衣穿，不用你瞎操心。你乖乖的坐两三天黑房子，你犯纪律的毛病会医治好的。’
    他接受了列宁的批评，以后一直工作得很好。”
    吃过饭，马上由集体农场主席陪同去参观列宁博物馆。参观指导员提起大家注意：这儿是斯大林和列宁经常会见的地方，一九一八年列宁就住在这所房子里，指挥国家建设社会主义。列宁的名著无产阶级革命与叛徒考茨基就在这儿写成的。
    列宁博物馆是高尔可地方一座庄严精致的建筑物，周围是森林，屋前有一大池塘，可以划船。屋主原名摩洛诺瓦，她是莫斯科著名资本家的寡妇。革命以后才把这所房产收归国有。
    自列宁到米海尔松工厂讲演，遭反革命分子行刺，受重伤后，很快恢复了工作，医生允许他工作时，他左手还挂着绷带。同时医生嘱咐他住到乡下去。一九一八年九月二十五日，他搬到高尔可来。
    在最大的客厅里，陈列着全部苏维埃国家机构建设的资料。看得出来，从俄国无产阶级专政诞生之日起，列宁、斯大林如何精细的研究了俄国革命每个时期的政权组织形式，只有紧密的联系了群众，合理的政权机构，才具有真正的能力，既能镇压反革命，又能建设社会主义经济。
    列宁的电话室是列宁顶欢喜去，经常工作的地方。他不愿意离开莫斯科，因为党，政府，人民在那儿。但他又必得遵守医生的吩咐，住在高尔可。从莫斯科到高尔可的长途电话架起来了。他爱电话这种交通工具像爱爱人一样，因为电话机拿在他手里，发挥的作用，使他喜悦，可以用它来指示政府的工作。深夜里可以同斯大林同志尽情的对话，交换对种种问题的意见，与党报通话，在电话里口述自己的文章。电话机是“老式的”，声音不好，列宁提出要求：
    “请增设扩音机吧！把声音加大点，使我工作得更好些！”
    列宁总离不开电话室，一九二二——二三年，气候寒冷，大屋子里生火耗费柴火，列宁睡在一间小屋里，生小火取暖。电话室里不生火，他总是穿起大衣接电话。没有生病的时候，他率性就在电话室里办公。
    内战结束以后，列宁亲自领导经济建设。农村经济受到极大的破坏，他用心研究当时俄国农民的情绪，要求，愿望。一九二一年一月八日，他接见了近郊农民，和他们深谈耕牛、农具、种子……等等。农民向列宁建议：
    “你关心我们，我们也关心你，你去我们那儿看看怎么样？”列宁九号早上就下乡去了。召集附近农民，开了个小小的露天演讲会，耐心的和三百多个农民报告国际国内的形势，说明情况，怎样才能从困难里走出来，如何恢复发展农村经济。农民向列宁要求道：
    “亲爱的列宁，让我们‘电气化’罢，我们没有灯！”列宁向政府作了建议，一九二三年五月，高尔可就装上电线，附近村庄点上电灯了。各村都跟列宁送来庆贺的信。列宁住在高尔可，很短时间就写成了两本小册子：《再论职工会与党的危机》；《职工会在社会主义下的作用》。充分阐明职工会是共产主义的学校。
    走进列宁的图书馆，满目是书，各种文字，精装本，平装本，油印本，手抄本都有。满架的书都被翻用过的。整理的人也从未动过，完全按生前的方式放着。书橱的书内夹有书笺，照料他的人说，他常常整天的埋头找材料，饭也顾不上吃。一九二二年夏天医生为他检查了身体，知道列宁过渡用脑，损坏了健康，劝他休息，在一定时期内不接见客人和朋友。七月尾，略有起色，医生只允许斯大林去会见他一次。直到夏季末了健康才完全恢复。可以自由到公园去散步了。列宁生平非常爱孩子，他的侄儿和女工的女孩竟成了他生活中不可缺少的伴侣。他叫他们：“宝宝！”慈爱的携着小手，在树林里转来转去。他们游玩过的地方，坐过的椅子，都用红绳圈起来。为了讨孩子们的欢喜，他像个大孩子一样，同他们一块渡过植树节。当孩子们用小铲子松土，栽好树苗，快活得大笑起来。他比孩子们更快乐。
    列宁的生活朴素简单。欢喜打猎，他以为打猎是最合适的休息。西比利亚农民老远为他背来鹿皮鞋，轻便的军用望远镜。列宁常把猎取的野兽送给附近国营农场作标本。近郊农民常拿收割的庄稼回敬列宁。他平素要求自己非常严格，打办公地方到他的卧室要上楼梯。特为他在楼梯旁装置了扶手，因为晚年他的腿行动无力，假如有人侍候他，扶他上楼，他会生气：
    “任何一双劳动的手，不要空着，把它用到有益的事情上去，恢复国家经济建设的事情上去。”
    二楼坐北朝南的一座凉台，列宁常去，夏日的傍晚，同他的妻子克鲁卜斯喀亚夫人躺在凉椅上休息。他多次在凉台上接见斯大林，至今流行在市上的列宁，斯大林双人合影照片，就是在凉台上闲谈时摄的。他的寝室更简单，一张床，两张矮凳，一方小桌，有书橱。药瓶放在窗台边的小桌上，手杖靠在桌旁。参观指导员深深的叹了口气，盯着桌上两本薄薄的书，她含着眼泪说：“世界上没有第二个人能比上他，为着共产主义事业，努力工作学习到停止自己的呼吸！”她更沉重的说：“列宁逝世的前两天，还在用心攻读《在马克思旗帜下》，和小说《爱与生活》。原来医生的诊断，他的健康本来是可以慢慢恢复的。突然，出人意外，在一九二四年一月二十一号早晨六点五十分钟，列宁患脑充血逝世，永别了我们。”满屋静默。怎么走出列宁博物馆的，我记不得了。
    一月二十三日晨，护灵柩的人有加里宁，米高扬，莫洛托夫，德米特洛夫，随行的行列直送到格娜西莫瓦，下午一时始达到莫斯科，灵柩停在职工大厦。天气很冷，人们不顾冰寒，拚命挤上去，要与革命的慈父告别。最后，参观指导员结束了自己的讲话。
    出门时，我仿佛看见那高大的，照料过列宁的老人的背影，我顺着大路直追，不知他什么时候走掉了，我再也找不见他。农场的主席送我们上汽车。
                                            一月十八日
