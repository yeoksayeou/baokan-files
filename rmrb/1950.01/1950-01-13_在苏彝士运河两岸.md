    On the Banks of the Suez Canal
    By Gai Dayanko, Translated by Jian Heng

    As the ship approaches the mouth of the Nile, the sparkling blue waters of the Mediterranean gradually turn pale and muddy yellow, as the great river pours thousands of tons of alluvial deposits into the sea.

    After the final stretch of the voyage, the land of ancient legends, sphinxes, and pyramids unfolds before us. We enter Port Said; the Suez Canal, the boundary between two continents, begins here. At the entrance to the port stands a monument to Ferdinand de Lesseps, the French engineer who built the canal. Narrow streets lined with low, sloping houses, towers, domes, and candle-shaped minarets stand on both sides. Suddenly, an advertising billboard promoting American Coca-Cola appears, apparently intending to proclaim its superiority over the Nile. A profile of an airplane made of shiny metal is mounted on the roof of a British airline company.

    As soon as the ship docked, Egyptian authorities came aboard to demand the ship's log, to see if this Soviet ship had "been to Palestine." Only after the officials confirmed that no such "crime" had been committed were the crew allowed to disembark.

    Egyptian Army Day happened to coincide with that foul weather. Accompanied by the sound of military drums, squads of soldiers marched through the main streets, while British officers watched them from the sidewalks with arrogant smiles. The Egyptian soldiers, wearing their sun-bleached and patched uniforms, presented a pitiful sight. They carried outdated British and American weapons that other countries had long abandoned. Many soldiers did not even have such weapons. Local and foreign photographers ran back and forth beside the disorganized ranks.

    "No matter what angle you take, the patches will be exposed," they complained.

    Cameras clicked, and the next day, the world would know about the "grand parade" of the Egyptian army.

    Not only Port Said, but the entire Egyptian industry is impoverished, with low technical levels, and agriculture is also very primitive. This is the result of British imperial rule. The British Empire was accustomed to exploiting cheap labor; hoes and shovels replaced excavators, sledgehammers replaced steam hammers, and baskets replaced cranes. British investment in the construction and use of the canal, as well as in cotton mills, railways, and oil mines, tightly controlled the economic lifeline of all of Egypt.

    "Egypt is independent," London politicians say. But what has changed?

    British capital continues to control the national economy, fertile land is occupied by foreign companies, and the army and government are also under British control.

    "We have only gained independence in name," Egyptians say. "We still have to seize independence from British rule."

    We toured the suburbs of Port Said. Small shacks made of sheet metal and wood stand on open ground, with sheds made of rags and wood chips. Barefoot, hungry children, women with haggard faces and tattered clothes, men as withered as mummies, dirt, ash, and foul smells are everywhere.

    We walked up to a small shack and found that it was inhabited by an Arab who understood a little English. He greeted us with obvious hostility, but when he learned that we were Soviet people, his attitude changed. He hurriedly rolled out a piece of wood for us to sit on and called out to his wife and son:

    "Come and see, there are some Soviet people here, real Soviet people!"
          ×                  ×                  ×
    More than nine-tenths of Egypt is desert, and life only flourishes on 4% of the land, in the Nile Valley and in the oases surrounding the lakes and canals. The population density in fertile areas reaches 450 to 500 people per square kilometer.

    More than half of all fertile land is owned by landlords. Two million poor farmers own only one-third of the land owned by 12,000 landlords and rich farmers. Many farmers own no land at all, or rent land from landlords under harsh conditions, or work as farm laborers for the latter. Poor farmers often rent small plots of land from rich farmers instead of from landlords. The rich farmers themselves are tenants of the landlords and divide the land into small plots to rent to poor farmers. Usurers and cotton merchants enslave Egyptian farmers with debt.

    Near a small house by the roadside, we saw a thin, dark-skinned farmer pulling a wooden plow. His veins seemed about to burst from the effort, and dirty sweat dripped down his body like rain. He had to plow the land well in order to plant corn. Behind the plow followed his wife, hunched and haggard, looking more like a suffering bird in a cage than a human being.

    We stopped to talk to the farmer. He seemed to enjoy the opportunity to take a breath. The story he told was tragic enough. His cow died the previous winter, and now he had to pull the plow himself. The dilapidated mud house nearby was his home. He had three children, who were ragged and often hungry. He and his wife also wore tattered clothes. This was one of the farmers who produced tens of thousands of tons of high-quality Egyptian cotton, but they themselves were half-naked, barefoot, and starving.

    "The Nile is long and deep, but the suffering of the Egyptian working masses is even longer and deeper," our casual acquaintance said sadly.

    An Arab-style white building with a blue dome stands on the waterfront of Port Said. In terms of architecture, it resembles a magnificent temple, but in the morning you do not hear the sound of prayer calls. The deity worshipped in this building is not the Islamic God but gold. The Bible here is the accountant's ledger. This is the head office of the Suez Canal Company.

    Formally, the Suez Canal is managed by thirty-three directors: nineteen French, ten British, two Dutch, and two Egyptian. In reality, the canal belongs to British businessmen, who control the majority of the shares that can be controlled.

    The high taxes levied on goods passing through the canal earn its owners huge profits. Before the war, the company could earn about ten million pounds a year.

    According to the original treaty, the 100-year term for the area through which the canal passes will expire in eighteen years, after which the canal will belong to Egypt. However, all indications show that Britain has no intention of giving up such a profitable enterprise and such an important strategic area. During World War II, a railway was built along the Sinai Peninsula, and an iron bridge was built to connect the two sides of Asia and Africa. Now there are plans to "straighten the canal to reduce the voyage and eliminate curves," which could create excuses for Britain to prolong its occupation of Egyptian land.

    The Suez Canal controls the Nile River and all of Egypt.

    Our ship left Port Said and proceeded along the canal. Where sand dunes encroach on the water, Arabs were desanding the canal. Where torrents of rainwater had eroded the stone embankment, Arabs were repairing it with hoes and shovels. There was no mechanization, no modern machine to make the work easier. "A hungry Arab is the cheapest machine," that is the reason of the owners of the canal.

    Convoys of ships heading east to the Orient via the Red Sea took this colonial route. On deck, you could see troops, guns, and tanks, their destination being obvious: India, Indonesia, Malaya, and Indochina. Returning from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, they were like blood-gorged spiders, so heavily loaded that the ships could barely move. Among them were Dutch and American oil tankers loaded with oil from Indonesia, British ships carrying Indian jute, Malayan rubber, and Australian wool, their destination being obvious: to Europe and America.

    There was a large airport on the shore. British bombers roared overhead, some landing and some taking off to circle over the lakes, deserts, and canals. Near the airport, rows of British tanks were lined up. This display was obviously intentional, indicating that the British lion still had its claws.

    Thousands of British tents were visible on both sides of the canal, like small pyramids. The entire waterway from Port Said to Suez was surrounded by British barracks, airports, tanks, and artillery.

    The canal ends at Suez. A thick odor of oil wafted from a British oil refinery there. We were told that the water here was so polluted with oil that even sharks dared not approach the bay. However, another kind of shark from the American Texaco Company came even more frequently.

    Our ship entered the Red Sea, but where was the exotic beauty of Egypt? Where was the land of sphinxes and pyramids?

    Egypt has many sphinxes and pyramids. But there are even more "British pyramids"—British camps. Each ancient pyramid is the tomb of an Egyptian king, representing the past, while each "British pyramid" harbors a threat to the independence of modern Egypt. What will the future hold? That depends on the Egyptian people themselves.

    在苏彝士运河两岸
    盖达扬柯著  健恒节译
    当海船航近尼罗河口的时候，因为这伟大的河流将几千吨的冲积物倾泄到海里，地中海蓝得发亮的水逐渐转呈苍白与泥黄。
    最后的一段航程过去之后，在我们面前展开了古代传奇与狮身人面像和金字塔的土地。我们进入塞德港；为两洲分界线的苏彝士运河即从这儿开始。港的入口处竖立着运河建造者，法国工程师雷塞普的纪念碑。两旁为窄狭的街道，排列着一堆堆的低矮倾斜的房屋，塔，圆顶房子和烛形的尖塔。突然出现一个宣扬美国可口可乐的广告牌，它显然欲表明它傲临尼罗河上的优异。由发光的金属片剪制的一个飞机侧形，安置在一家英国航空公司的屋顶上。
    船一入坞，埃及当局就上来索取船上的航海日志，看这苏联船是否“到过巴勒斯坦”。官吏们在证实了没有犯这种“罪状”之后，才让船员登岸。
    埃及军队节日恰好碰上那个恶劣的天气。在军鼓的伴奏下一队队的兵士行经主要街道，人行道上英国军官们带着傲慢的微笑在看他们。埃及军士穿着他们那太阳晒白了的补钉制服，呈现着一种可怜形相。他们携着其他国家早已废弃了的英美式的陈旧武器。好些兵士甚至连这种武器都没有，本地与外国的摄影记者在这不整齐的行列旁来回跑着。
    “任你采取那个角度去照，补绽都得露出来”。他们抱怨着说。
    开麦拉响着，第二天全世界就将知道埃及军队“伟大的阅兵式”了。
    不仅是塞德港，整个埃及的工业都很贫乏，技术水平很低，农业亦非常原始。这就是英帝统治的结果。英帝习惯于剥削廉价劳动力；鹤嘴锄与铲子代替了掘土机，大锤用来代替汽机锤，筐子代替了起重机。英国对运河的修建与使用，以及对棉织厂、铁路和油矿等的投资，紧紧扼住了全埃及经济的命脉。
    “埃及已经独立了。”伦敦的政客们这么说。但是有着什么改变了呢？
    英国资本继续掌握全国经济，肥沃的土地给外国公司霸占了，军队与政府亦在英国控制之下。
    “我们仅是名义上获得了独立。”埃及人说，“我们还得从英国统治下夺取独立。”
    我们游历塞德港郊区。洋铁皮与木板架成的小屋竖立在光地上，破布与木片作的棚子。光着身子的饥饿的小孩，脸色憔悴衣衫褴褛的女人，干皱得象木乃伊的男子，到处是脏东西、灰屑和恶嗅。
    我们走到一个小屋前，发觉里面住着一个略懂英语的阿拉伯人，他显然含有敌意地迎着我们，但当他知道我们是苏联人之后，态度就改变了，他赶忙滚出一段木头来给我们坐，并招呼他的老婆同儿子说：
    “来看罢，这儿有些苏联人，真的苏联人哩！”
          ×                  ×                  ×
    埃及全境有十分之九以上都是沙漠，生命仅在它百分之四的土地上，在尼罗河谷与围绕着湖泊及运河的绿洲上开放，肥沃区域的人口密度，每方公里达四百五十至五百人。
    全部肥沃的土地中有一半以上归地主所有。二百万贫农仅有一万二千个地主及富农所有土地的三分之一。好些农夫自己全无土地，或以苛酷条件租种地主田地，或为后者作农场雇工。贫农时常不从地主而从富农租得小块土地。富农自己为地主佃户，将土地分成小块租给贫农。高利贷者与购棉商使埃及农人沦于负债的奴役境地。
    靠近路旁的一个小屋，我们看到一个干瘦的黑皮肤的农夫在背一个木犁。因为用力，他的青筋胀得似乎要破裂了，污汗如雨般沿着身体淌滴。他为着种玉蜀黍要耕好地。在犁的后面跟着他的妻子，伛偻衰颓，与其说象一个人，不如说象一个囚笼里受苦的鸟还恰当些。
    我们停下来同那个农夫谈谈。他似乎喜欢着有机会松一口气。他所说的故事是够悲惨的了。前一年冬天他的牛死了，现在他只得自己拉犁，近旁倾圯的土房子就是他的家，他有三个孩子，他们衣衫破烂，常常挨饿。他同他的妻子也穿着烂衣服，这就是生产着成万吨上等埃及棉花的耕种者之一，但是他们自己却半裸着，赤着双足还挨着饿。
    “尼罗河是深长的，可是埃及劳苦大众的痛苦更深长哩。”我们那偶逢的相识者忧伤地说。
    一个阿拉伯式装璜的蓝顶白色大厦耸立在塞德港水滨，就建筑上说它象一个宏伟的庙宇，可是在清晨你没有听到过呼报祈祷时刻的声音，这所建筑里所崇拜的不是回教的上帝而是黄金，这里的圣经是会计员的帐簿，这就是苏彝士运河公司的总公司。
    形式上苏彝士运河由三十三个董事管理：十九个法国人，十个英国人，两个荷兰人和两个埃及人，实际上运河却属于英国商人，他们掌握了股票中能够控制的多数。
    货物经过运河所抽的高税为它的所有主赚得丰厚的赢利，战前公司每年约可赚一千万英镑。
    就原订的条约说，运河通过的地区的一百年限期过十八年即将届满，以后运河将归埃及所有，但是各种迹象都表明着英国无意放弃一个这么赚钱的企业和一个这么重要的战略地区。在二次世界大战当中西奈半岛那边沿岸建了一条铁路，同时架了一道铁桥来沟通亚非洲的两岸，现在计划着要“修直运河，以达减缩航程及消除弯曲”，这些都可以造成借口使英国霸占埃及的土地得以延长。
    苏彝士运河控制了尼罗河及整个埃及。
    我们的船离开塞得港沿运河前进，在沙丘侵入水流之处，有阿拉伯人在作运河的除砂工作，在雨水的洪流冲溃了石筑的堤岸地方，阿拉伯人用鹤嘴锄与铲子在修理。没有机械化，没有一架现代化的机器来使得工作容易一些，“一个饥饿的阿拉伯人就是最便宜的机械，”这就是运河的主人的理由。
    一队队经红海到东方去的船取道这条殖民地的航路。在甲板上你可看到军队，枪炮和坦克，它们的目的地是显明的：印度，印尼，马来亚与印度支那。从红海回返地中海时，它们象吸饱了血的蜘蛛一样，满载得连船都开不动，其中有从印尼装载石油的荷兰和美国油船，有带着印度的黄麻，马来亚的橡皮，以及澳洲的羊毛的英国船，它们的目的地也很显明：到欧洲和美洲去。
    岸上有一个大的机场。英国轰炸机在头顶轰叫，有的降落有的起飞到湖泊、沙漠与运河上空回旋。机场近旁排列着几行英国坦克。这种炫耀显然是有意的，表示着英国狮子还有它的爪子。
    成千个英国营帐在运河两岸象小金字塔一般显露出来。从塞德港至苏彝士的全部水道都给英国军营，机场、坦克与大炮包围着。
    运河终点为苏彝士。一股浓重的油气从那里一个英国炼油厂传出来。人家告诉我们这儿的水被油弄脏得连沙鱼都不敢靠近海湾。然而另外一种从美国德士古公司来的沙鱼，却来得更勤密了。
    我们的船进入红海，但是何处有着埃及的异域的美呢？何处是狮身人面像与金字塔的国度呢？
    埃及有着很多的狮身人面像和金字塔。但更多的却是“英国金字塔”——英国营帐。每一个古代的金字塔是一个埃及王的坟墓，它代表着过去，每个“英国金字塔”却藏着一种对现代埃及独立的威胁，将来会如何呢？那就得依靠埃及人民自己了。
