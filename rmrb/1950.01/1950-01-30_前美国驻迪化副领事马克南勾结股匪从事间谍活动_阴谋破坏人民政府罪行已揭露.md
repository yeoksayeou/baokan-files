Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, January 29th: Former U.S. Vice Consul in Dihua, Mackinnon, has been proven to be an espionage agent colluding with bandit gangs within Xinjiang. This was revealed by three White Russians formerly under the command of the notorious Xinjiang bandit Usman after they surrendered to the People's Liberation Army.

Former U.S. Vice Consul in Dihua, Mackinnon, mysteriously disappeared on September 28th last year after the uprising of the Kuomintang troops in Xinjiang. Only with the surrender of these three White Russians has Mackinnon's mysterious whereabouts become known to the world. Mackinnon took advantage of the fact that reactionary bandits had not yet been completely eliminated in the early days of Xinjiang's peaceful liberation. He sneaked from Dihua to the bandit den of Zhenxi in eastern Xinjiang, gathering key bandit leaders Usman, Janim Khan, and Sultan along the way, instructing them to continue resisting the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, and giving them 25 taels of gold. He then turned southwest and entered India.

The three surrendered White Russians arrived in Dihua in mid-December 1949. They confessed the details of Mackinnon's escape from Dihua as follows:

Mackinnon, along with American student Bai Zhiren, White Russian Vasily Zvantsov, and two other White Russians, carrying two radio stations, left Dihua in a privately owned jeep on September 28, 1949, and sneaked eastward. Among these people, Vasily was the main accomplice of the bandit leader Usman. Since February 1949, he had been sent to Mackinnon's place to learn how to use the radio for secret communication.

The day after departure, Mackinnon arrived in Fuyuan, abandoned the jeep in the mountains near Fuyuan, and together with the White Russian bandits there, rode horses to Salkamushi, north of Gucheng, on September 30, where they met with Usman and stayed for four days. On October 3, Mackinnon and Usman continued eastward and, while passing the Mori River (Mulei River), met with more than 100 bandits under Janim Khan who were hiding in the mountains. The bandits arrived at Zhenxi, the center of activity for Sultan's bandit gang, on October 24th and 25th.

While traveling with the bandit gangs, especially after arriving in Zhenxi, Mackinnon emphasized to the bandits methods of undermining the democratic cause of the Chinese people. Mackinnon instructed Usman, Janim Khan, and other bandits to continue resisting the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government and assured them that the United States would provide them with assistance. Mackinnon told them that they should currently accumulate strength to await the outbreak of the Third World War. Vasily told the bandits that he and Mackinnon would head to the Lop Nur area to scout out retreat routes for them in case they had to retreat in the future. Mackinnon proposed taking the sons of Usman, Janim Khan, and Sultan to the United States for training, so that they could be sent back to Xinjiang to start an uprising when the Third World War broke out. However, Mackinnon's proposal was not accepted. Usman and the other two found three other young Kazakh men to replace their sons to go to the United States to "study." Usman sent Sultan to escort Mackinnon and his party to Lop Nur, providing them with fourteen horses. Mackinnon gave the bandits twenty-five taels of gold.

According to the three surrendered White Russians, Mackinnon was not the only American who contacted Usman's bandit gang. The three White Russians testified that Paxton, the former American consul who left Dihua earlier than Mackinnon, had also been to Usman's bandit den in March and July of 1949, staying for one or two days each time, giving the bandits various instructions.

    前美国驻迪化副领事马克南勾结股匪从事间谍活动
    阴谋破坏人民政府罪行已揭露
    【新华社迪化二十九日电】前迪化美国领事馆副领事马克南，已被证明是与新疆境内股匪相勾结的间谍。这是新疆著名惯匪乌斯满部下三名白俄人在向人民解放军投诚后所揭露的。
    美国驻迪化前副领事马克南在去年新疆国民党军队起义后突于九月二十八日失踪，直至此次三名白俄人投诚才使马克南的神秘行踪为世人所知。马克南利用了新疆和平解放初期反动匪徒尚未肃清的条件，由迪化潜往新疆东部的匪窟镇西地区，沿途集合重要匪首乌斯满、贾尼木汉和苏勒唐指示他们继续反抗新疆省人民政府，并送给他们黄金二十五两，然后折向西南，进入印度。
    投诚的三名白俄人是在一九四九年十二月中旬来到迪化的。他们供述马克南潜离迪化后的详情如下：
    马克南和美国学生白智仁白俄瓦西里·兹万佐夫及其他白俄两名，带电台两部，在一九四九年九月二十八日乘自备吉普车离开迪化潜行东去。在这些人中，瓦西里是匪首乌斯满的主要帮凶，自一九四九年二月起被派来马克南处学习利用无线电作秘密通讯。
    马克南在出发的第二天到达孚远，把吉普车丢在孚远附近山中，而与该处的白俄匪徒一同乘马在九月三十日到达古城以北的萨尔卡木希地方，与乌斯满会合，并在该处停留了四天。十月三日，马克南和乌斯满一同继续向东进发，并在经过莫里河（木垒河）时，与匿居山中的贾尼木汉匪股一百余人会合。匪徒们在十月二十四、二十五两日先后到达了苏勒唐匪部活动中心的镇西。
    马克南在和匪部一同行进途中，特别是在到达镇西以后，向匪徒们着重地宣传了破坏中国人民民主事业的方法。马克南指示乌斯满、贾尼木汉和其他匪徒们继续反抗新疆省人民政府，并保证美国将给他们以援助。马克南告诉他们在目前应当积蓄力量，以待第三次世界大战的爆发。瓦西里对匪徒们说：他和马克南将要折往罗布诺尔地区，这是为了替他们侦察将来在必须撤退时的退路。马克南提议把乌斯满、贾尼木汉和苏勒唐三人的儿子带往美国训练，到第三次大战时好送他们回新疆举事。但是马克南的这个提议没有被接受。乌斯满等三人找了另外三个哈族青年代替他们的儿子随马克南到美国去“留学”。乌斯满派苏勒唐把马克南等一行送往罗布诺尔，并送他们十四匹马。马克南则送给匪徒们二十五两黄金。
    据投诚的三名白俄人说，与乌斯满匪帮联络的美国人不止马克南一人。三名白俄人证明，比马克南早离开迪化的美国前领事派克斯顿也曾在一九四九年三月间和七月间到过乌斯满的匪窟，每次都停留一两天，给匪徒们以各种指示。
