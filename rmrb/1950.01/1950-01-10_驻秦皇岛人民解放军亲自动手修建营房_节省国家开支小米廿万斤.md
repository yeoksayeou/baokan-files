    People's Liberation Army Troops Stationed in Qinhuangdao Personally Build Barracks
    Saving the State 200,000 Jin of Millet
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to make long-term plans, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Qinhuangdao, adhering to the principle of self-reliance, built their own brand-new barracks from the ruins of a former Japanese army camp after 45 days of hard struggle. This saved the state the expense of 200,000 jin of millet. At the beginning of the construction, the Party committee of the unit called on the troops to overcome difficulties and build barracks themselves in order to reduce state expenditure. All commanders and fighters organized all the technical personnel in the entire unit, such as carpenters, masons, ironworkers, and stonemasons, into a construction team of more than 300 people. With the assistance and guidance of two engineers from the Kailuan Mining Bureau, they began this arduous construction work on November 5th of last year. During the construction, the comrades participating in the construction worked as intensely as they would on the battlefield. Comrade Shi Shan of the stonemason platoon was using explosives to blast stones on the mountain when a stone hit his head, covering his face with blood, but he simply bandaged it himself and continued to work as usual. In order to save on material expenses, they dismantled old bricks from collapsed walls to replace new bricks, and used scrap wood to make doors and windows. Many of their daily tools were self-made from scrap iron and scrap wood. In the winter on the coast, they stomped mud barefoot. Some comrades' hands were chapped and frozen, but they continued to plaster walls in the cold wind. People passing by said, "The People's Liberation Army are truly made of iron! It is a blessing for the people to have such a good team in the country."
    According to incomplete statistics, a total of 2,883 masons and 274 ironworkers were used in the 45 days. The budget was 720,000 jin of millet, but they only used 320,000 jin, and they also made 91 extra large wooden platforms (each platform can sleep 20 people). In addition to saving materials, the wage millet alone saved the state 180,000 to 200,000 jin of millet.

    驻秦皇岛人民解放军亲自动手修建营房
    节省国家开支小米廿万斤
    【本报讯】驻秦皇岛人民解放军某部为了长期打算，在亲自动手建设的原则下，经过四十五天的艰苦奋斗，从日寇兵营的废址上，修建起自己崭新的兵营。给国家节省了二十万斤小米的开支。修建开始时，该部党委即号召部队自己动手克服困难修建营房，以减少国家开支。全体指战员将全部队所有的技术人员如木工、泥瓦匠、铁工、石工等组织起来，成立了一个三百余人的建设大队，在开滦矿务局两位工程师的协助与指导下，从去年十一月五日即从事这一艰巨的修建工作。在修建中，参加建设的同志们，始终像在战场上一样，紧张地工作着。石工排的史善同志，在山上用炸药炸石头，石头崩到头上，流血满面，但他自己用布包扎上后还在照常的工作着。为了节省材料的开支，他们在塌了的墙上拆旧砖代新砖，用废木条子做门窗，他的许多日用工具，都是用废铁和废木自造的。他们在海岸上的冬天，赤着脚去跺泥；有的同志手都冻裂了，仍在寒风中抹墙。过路的人们看见都说：“解放军真是铁打的人！国家有这样的好队伍，真是老百姓的福气”。
    据不完全统计，四十五天中，共用了泥瓦工二千八百八十三个，铁工二百七十四个。预算是七十二万斤米，但他们只用了三十二万斤，而且还多做了九十一床大木炕（每床能睡二十人）。除节省材料外，仅工资米即给国家节省小米十八万到二十万斤。
