Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 28th: The Guangdong Provincial Party Congress convened by the CCP Guangdong Provincial Committee successfully concluded on the 21st. Representatives from the CCP Hainan District Committee, the CCP Chao-Shan, Xing-Mei, Dongjiang, Beijiang, Xijiang, Zhujiang, Central District, and Nanlu District Committees, as well as from Guangzhou municipal organs and military units, participated in the meeting. Representatives from Guangxi, Southern Hunan, and Southern Jiangxi also attended. The purpose of the meeting was to arrange the various tasks of the Guangdong Provincial Communist Party for 1950. Fang Fang, Third Secretary of the CCP South China Sub-bureau, delivered the opening speech. Ye Jianying, Secretary of the CCP South China Sub-bureau, delivered a report on "The Work Tasks of Guangdong in 1950." This report was thoroughly discussed and adopted by the meeting. The report pointed out that under the correct leadership of the CCP South China Sub-bureau, the Party organizations and people's armed forces in various parts of Guangdong had correctly implemented the various policies of the CCP Central Committee and had achieved great results through hard work in the three and a half years of the People's Liberation War. Furthermore, they cooperated with the southward People's Liberation Army and rapidly liberated Guangzhou and the entire mainland of the province in a very short period of time. However, at present, the work in the original old liberated areas of Guangdong is not thorough enough, and various organizations and systems have not been systematically established. The masses in the vast new areas have not been mobilized and organized, the rural political power is still in the hands of a small number of landlords and rich peasants, and local tyrants and bullies are still oppressing the people. Based on the local situation in Guangdong and the requirements of the national situation, the report specified that the basic tasks of the Party in Guangdong and the people of the province this year are: (1) Liberate Hainan Island, liberate all of Guangdong, resolutely eliminate the overt and covert remaining bandits, stabilize social order throughout the province, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and guarantee urban and rural construction. (2) Launch a movement against local tyrants, implement rent reduction and production-based disaster relief; mobilize the masses, prepare cadres, prepare methods, and prepare organizations to strive to start land distribution this winter to create favorable conditions for future development of production. (3) Grasp the overall financial and economic policies proposed by Chairman Mao, restore transportation, restore production, consolidate finance, complete financial and economic tasks, ensure the needs of the war, and lay the foundation for construction. (4) Conscientiously strengthen the work along the coast and on various islands, actively build up the Pearl River Delta and coastal defenses, and consolidate the gateway to South China. The report pointed out that in order to complete the above tasks, the main link lies in mobilizing the masses, relying on the cities, and expanding work in the vast countryside, while also taking into account the cities. The report emphasized the importance of paying attention to and holding people's representative conferences at all levels to connect with the masses, unite the broad masses of the people, and promote various tasks. At the same time, it is necessary to conduct investigations and research in order to understand the actual situation as a basis for future production and construction. The report concluded by calling on all Party members in Guangdong to strengthen their study of policies, study Mao Zedong's thought, leadership methods, and work style, to be good at uniting themselves and uniting the people of all classes, to raise the work of the entire Party a step further, and to struggle to complete the major tasks of Guangdong this year. In addition to the above report, the Party Congress also listened to and discussed special reports on military affairs, finance and economy, organization and publicity, and mass movements.

    中共广东省委召开全省党代会议确定今年工作任务
    【新华社广州二十八日电】中共广东省委召开的全省党员代表会议已于二十一日胜利闭幕。参加会议的有中共海南区党委，中共潮汕、兴梅、东江、北江、西江、珠江、中区、南路八个地委和广州市各机关、部队的党员代表。广西、湘南、赣南各地亦派代表参加。会议目的为布置广东省共产党一九五零年的各项工作。中共华南分局第三书记方方在会上致开幕词。中共华南分局书记叶剑英在会上作了《关于一九五零年广东工作任务》的报告。这一报告已经会议详细讨论后通过。该报告指出：广东各地党的组织和人民武装在过去中共华南分局领导下，正确执行了中共中央的各种政策，在三年半的人民解放战争中，艰苦奋斗，获得很大成绩；这次更配合了解放军南下大军，在很短时间内即迅速解放了广州和全省大陆。但是，目前广东原来的老解放区的工作还不够深入，还没有有系统地建立各种组织和制度，而广大新区的群众也没有发动和组织起来，乡村政权仍掌握在少数地主富农手中，土匪恶霸仍在欺压人民。依据广东省地方情况和全国形势的要求，报告指明了广东党及全省人民今年的基本任务是：（一）解放海南岛，解放全广东，并坚决肃清公开的和隐蔽的残余匪帮，安定全省社会秩序，巩固人民民主专政，保障城乡建设。（二）开展反恶霸运动，贯彻减租和生产救灾工作；发动群众，准备干部，准备办法，准备组织，争取今冬开始分配土地，为今后发展生产创造有利的条件。（三）掌握毛主席所提出的四面八方的财政经济政策，恢复交通，恢复生产，整理财政，完成财政经济任务，保证战争需要，并打下建设的基础。（四）认真加强沿海及各岛屿的工作，积极建设珠江三角洲和沿海防务，巩固华南的门户。报告指明：为完成上述任务，主要环节在于发动群众，依托城市，展开广大农村的工作。同时兼顾城市。报告强调要重视和开好各界人民代表会议，以联系群众，团结广大人民推行各项工作；同时展开调查研究，以便了解实际情况，作为今后进行生产建设的依据。报告最后号召广东全体党员必须加强学习政策，学习毛泽东的思想、领导方法和工作作风，要善于团结自己、团结各阶层人民，把全党工作提高一步，为完成广东今年的重大任务而斗争。除上述报告外，党代表会议还听取和讨论了关于军事、财政经济、组织宣传、群众运动等专题报告。
