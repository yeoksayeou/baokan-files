Resolution on Organizing Seamen's Consumer Cooperatives

(Adopted by the National Conference of Representatives of Seamen's Unions on December 26, 1949
Approved by the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on January 5, 1950)

In order to avoid exploitation by intermediaries, protect the wage income of seamen, minimize the impact of price fluctuations, and stabilize their lives while increasing their enthusiasm for production, the National Conference of Representatives of Seamen's Unions deems it necessary to organize seamen's consumer cooperatives in various localities and hereby resolves as follows:

    I. Seamen's consumer cooperatives shall serve members wholeheartedly and not aim for profit or dividends. Their task is to attract and concentrate seamen's shares, purchase inexpensive daily necessities (such as rice, cloth, firewood, oil, salt, etc.) from various localities, and distribute them to members at prices lower than the market price in fixed quantities.

    II. Seamen's consumer cooperatives are mass economic organizations under the leadership of the seamen's union, based on the principle of voluntary shareholding. The cooperative's committee shall be elected by the members' congress or the members' representative congress. The cooperative's committee shall periodically report the cooperative's affairs to the members' congress or the members' representative congress; and shall stipulate the allocation quantity and purchase procedures for members, and establish cost accounting and accounting systems, etc. The seamen's union may, when necessary, send special personnel to assist in its work.

    III. Seamen's consumer cooperatives in various localities must maintain close contact, help each other, exchange information, and purchase goods on each other's behalf through transfers to save manpower and material resources.

    IV. Seamen's consumer cooperatives in various localities may, when necessary, request shipping companies to provide convenience in terms of funds, housing, equipment, and transportation, and should register with the local People's Government to request tax reductions and exemptions according to regulations. However, seamen's consumer cooperatives must guarantee that they will not use this condition to transform into other illegal profit-making businesses.

    V. Existing seamen's consumer cooperatives in various localities should be reorganized and improved according to the above principles and their own specific circumstances; those that have not yet been organized should quickly begin preparations. If the capitalist has already established a cooperative (such as the Shanghai Minsheng Company), then the labor and capital sides should send representatives to negotiate methods of improvement, sign a contract to reorganize the cooperative, and abide by it together.

    关于组织海员消费合作社的决议
    （一九四九年十二月二十六日全国各地海员工会代表会议通过
    一九五○年一月五日中华全国总工会常务委员会扩大会议批准）
    为了避免中间剥削，保障海员之工资收入，不受或少受物价波动之影响，使之生活安定而提高生产积极性，全国各地海员工会代表会议认为有在各地组织海员消费合作社之必要，特作决议如下：
    一、海员消费合作社应全心全意为社员服务，不以营利分红为目的。其任务是吸收和集中海员股金，购买各地廉价的日常必需品（如米、布、柴、油、盐等），以低于市场之价格，定量配售给社员。
    二、海员消费合作社是在海员工会领导下的群众性的经济组织，以自愿入股为原则。社务委员会由社员大会或社员代表大会选举产生之。社务委员会应定期向社员大会或社员代表大会报告社务；并应规定社员的配售量与购买手续及建立成本核算和会计制度等等。海员工会于必要时得派专人协助其工作。
    三、各地海员消费合作社须取得密切联系，相互帮助，互通情况，并以转账方式相互代购物资，以节省人力物力。
    四、各地海员消费合作社，必要时得请求轮船公司在资金、房屋、设备及运输方面给予便利，并应向当地人民政府登记，请求按章减免税额。但海员消费合作社必须保证，不利用这一条件转为其他非法的营利事业。
    五、各地方已有之海员消费合作社，应按以上原则和本身具体情况加以整理改进；尚未有组织者，则应迅速进行筹备。如资方已建立有合作社者（如上海民生公司）则由劳资双方互派代表协议改进的办法，签订改组合作社的合同共同遵守。
