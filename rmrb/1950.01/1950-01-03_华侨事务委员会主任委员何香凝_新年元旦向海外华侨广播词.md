Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 2nd: On New Year's Day, 1950, He Xiangning, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, delivered a broadcast address to overseas Chinese. The full text of the broadcast is as follows:

Dear Overseas Chinese Compatriots!

I am extremely excited to have the opportunity to speak to overseas Chinese compatriots in the first New Year after the founding of the People's Republic of China!

Dear Overseas Chinese Compatriots: The People's Liberation War in China has achieved almost complete victory on the Chinese mainland. The liberation of the entire country, including Taiwan, will be realized in the very near future.

This great victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution is the result of the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the united efforts of all revolutionary classes throughout the country. Therefore, we should pay the highest respect to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army.

Compatriots! You have long had a glorious record in the history of the Chinese revolution. As early as the Xinhai Revolution, overseas Chinese contributed money and effort to help the revolution. Mr. Sun Yat-sen called overseas Chinese the "mother of the revolution." During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, overseas Chinese continuously provided support and made their best efforts to persist in the war. In this People's Liberation War, many young overseas Chinese, especially those returning from various parts of Southeast Asia, actively participated in the war, the land reform, and other revolutionary struggles. Many overseas Chinese abroad have also been able to stand firm, adhere to the people's democratic stance, and wage unyielding struggles against the reactionaries. These are all glorious contributions of overseas Chinese to the motherland.

The great victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution has greatly strengthened the peace-loving people's democratic forces around the world and has also strengthened our overseas Chinese's confidence in a bright future. In the past, some overseas Chinese, deceived, blinded, oppressed, and blockaded by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, could not understand the truth of the People's Democratic Revolution in the motherland, and even went astray. Now that Guangdong and Fujian have been liberated, it is easier for these overseas Chinese to clearly understand the People's Democratic Revolution in the motherland. From now on, the patriotic democratic united front among overseas Chinese will inevitably be extensively developed and firmly established. This broad democratic united front should include all strata, organizations, and people from all walks of life; as long as they are patriotic elements who love peace and democracy, they can participate in this patriotic democratic united front. Even those overseas Chinese who, in the past, more or less blindly followed the Kuomintang reactionaries, as long as they can repent and be willing to join the patriotic democratic camp, we should all welcome them. However, for certain extremely stubborn reactionary elements, a small number of dregs who are willing to be the pawns of Chiang Kai-shek's remnants and the tools of imperialism, the majority of our patriotic overseas Chinese must wage a resolute struggle against them.

Dear Overseas Chinese Compatriots: You have been subjected to long-term humiliation, deception, extortion, exploitation, and persecution by the special agents and lackeys sent by imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits overseas. In recent years, the persecution suffered by overseas Chinese in Malaya, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Thailand, and other places has been particularly serious. Some overseas Chinese villages have even been completely burned, and the old and weak have been detained. These inhumane and human rights-violating crimes are still continuing. The domestic democratic parties have repeatedly appealed to the people of the world about this and lodged serious protests to imperialism. Now the people of the world and domestic compatriots have a clear understanding of the truth of imperialism.

Dear Overseas Chinese Compatriots: You live abroad, intermingled with local ethnic groups. For hundreds of years, overseas Chinese have established close relations with the local people. In terms of economic and social life, overseas Chinese cannot survive independently without the local ethnic groups. For example, some overseas Chinese in Thailand and Java have inherited their positions for generations, their property remains in the local area, and their relatives and bloodlines are also in the local area. They regard the local area as their second hometown. Some have married local people, given birth to sons and daughters, established families and businesses, and formed flesh-and-blood ties with the local people. Therefore, overseas Chinese overseas, especially in various parts of Southeast Asia, have long established peaceful, friendly, and close relations with the local people. This is the result of the long history of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. We should cherish it, protect it, and promote it. This spirit of equality, peace, and friendship between ethnic groups was advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the past. The New Democratic ethnic policy advocated by Chairman Mao and the ethnic policy in the Common Program adopted by the CPPCC are also consistently aimed at realizing true equality and cooperation between all ethnic groups in the world.

However, in order to implement its policy of aggression and colonialism and to exploit the people of the colonies, imperialism inevitably attacks the people's forces and inevitably uses its means of division, alienation, and incitement, directing local reactionaries to use the chaos of war to massacre, rob, and kidnap overseas Chinese, attempting to alienate the feelings between overseas Chinese and local ethnic groups and create ethnic rifts. Such incidents have occurred in Indonesia and Vietnam in the past few years. Compatriots: We should point out here that the recent unfortunate incidents in various parts of Southeast Asia, large and small, of local reactionaries oppressing and massacring overseas Chinese under the direct instigation of imperialism, are all created by imperialism!

Now that the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution is about to achieve victory throughout the country, and the strength of the Chinese people has become unprecedentedly strong, the status of overseas Chinese in the world will therefore be raised a step. The people of various ethnic groups will undoubtedly be even more close and friendly to overseas Chinese. We overseas Chinese should also be even more close and friendly to the people of local ethnic groups. At the same time, we should be vigilant against the imperialist conspiracies and poisonous schemes of sowing discord among overseas Chinese and among ethnic groups, expose them to the outside world, so as to unite overseas Chinese, unite international friends among the local people, and expand the people's democratic united front to the local people. Only by consolidating and expanding the international peaceful democratic united front can we isolate imperialism and strive for the victory of the people; only when the local people are truly liberated can overseas Chinese obtain true freedom, equality, and permanent peaceful life. If we overseas Chinese can do this, we can gain the true friendship of various local ethnic groups, truly improve the status of overseas Chinese, and obtain a permanent free and peaceful life.

Dear Compatriots: Although you are abroad, you are still closely related to your domestic compatriots. Domestic relatives of overseas Chinese rely on remittances from abroad to maintain their lives. The first thing that overseas Chinese who work hard all year round and look forward to day and night is the peace and progress of their hometowns. Now we can tell you: In areas where relatives of overseas Chinese are concentrated, we will use various methods to protect local order and ensure the lives of relatives of overseas Chinese. At the same time, we are preparing to find ways to improve remittances, so that the supplies from overseas can be conveniently and quickly delivered to the hands of the relatives of overseas Chinese. Now, the Bank of China and the People's Bank of China, after the liberation of Fujian and Macau, are fully paying attention to improving remittances. Overseas Chinese service stations are also being prepared to be set up successively in Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and other cities to do a good job in remittance work. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government is studying remittance regulations that are beneficial to overseas Chinese and suitable for the actual situation. Basically, we must be based on the New Democratic economic policy and the provisions in the Common Program, to achieve both public and private interests and facilitate remittances. We must take care of the interests of the relatives of overseas Chinese and let the government's banking institutions manage and guide the business of overseas Chinese's private remittance agencies, exchange bureaus, and bank-remittance bureaus. Therefore, we hope that overseas Chinese, domestic relatives of overseas Chinese, and remittance bureaus at home and abroad will unite around the People's Government, cooperate fully, and work together to improve remittances. This is a necessary measure to stabilize the lives of relatives of overseas Chinese.

Dear Overseas Chinese Compatriots: Today is the beginning of 1950. This new year will be the last year of the War of Liberation domestically, and it will also be the year of starting to shift to national construction. The people of the whole country will fundamentally eliminate the imperialist forces and the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits throughout the country. After that, we will be able to start building our country. We warmly and sincerely welcome overseas Chinese to help the motherland even more, based on the revolutionary tradition, and participate in the great and glorious cause of building a new China. If the motherland is strong, your difficult times will be shortened, and the difficulties can be overcome. Compatriots: The dark days are not long, and dawn is just around the corner. I wish you unity and progress, and I extend my New Year's greetings to all of you!

    新年元旦向海外华侨广播词
    【新华社北京二日电】一九五○年元旦中央人民政府华侨事务委员会主任委员何香凝向海外华侨广播讲演，播词全文如下：亲爱的侨胞们！
    在中华人民共和国开国后第一个新年，我有机会向海外侨胞讲话，觉得万分兴奋！
    亲爱的侨胞们：现在国内人民解放战争，已经在中国大陆上取得了几乎全部的胜利，包括台湾在内的全国解放，在很近的将来，就要实现。
    这中国人民民主革命的伟大胜利，是由于中国人民解放军的英勇作战，由于中国共产党和毛主席的领导正确，由于全国各革命阶层的团结一致而获得的成果。因此，我们应该向毛主席、朱总司令和人民解放军全体指战员致最高的敬礼。
    侨胞们！你们在中国革命历史上，早有了光辉的记录。早在辛亥革命时代，侨胞出钱出力帮助革命，孙中山先生称华侨是“革命之母”。到八年抗日战争期间，侨胞不断输将，尽了最大努力，坚持了抗战。在这次人民解放战争中，许多青年侨胞，尤其是从南洋各地回国的青年，积极地参加了战争，参加了土地改革和其他种种革命斗争。在国外也有许多侨胞，能站稳岗位，坚持人民民主立场，与反动派作不屈不挠的斗争。这些都是华侨对祖国的光荣贡献。
    中国人民民主革命的伟大胜利，大大地增强了全世界爱好和平的人民民主力量，也增强了我们华侨对光明前途的信心。过去有一部分华侨，因为受帝国主义和国民党反动派的欺骗、蒙蔽、压迫、封锁，不能了解祖国人民民主革命的真相，甚至走上了歧途。现在广东和福建都解放了，这部分华侨对祖国人民民主革命也容易认识清楚了。从此，华侨中的爱国民主统一战线，必然广泛地开展和巩固地建立起来。这广大的民主统一战线，应该包括各阶层、社团和各界人士；只要是爱好和平民主的爱国分子，都能参加这爱国民主统一战线。甚至在过去或多或少的盲从国民党反动派的侨胞，只要他们能够改过自新，愿意跑进爱国民主阵营，我们也应该一律欢迎。但是对于某些极端顽固反动分子，甘心作蒋匪残余的爪牙和帝国主义工具的少数败类，我们大多数爱国华侨却一定要和他们进行坚决的斗争。
    亲爱的侨胞们：你们在海外受帝国主义和国民党匪帮所派的特务走狗，长期的凌辱、欺骗、敲榨、剥削和迫害，近几年来，在马来亚、印尼、菲律宾、澳洲、越南、泰国等地的华侨，所受的迫害，尤其严重。甚而有些华侨村庄，整个被焚，老弱被拘，这种种惨无人道和摧残人权的罪恶行为，直到现在，还在继续。国内各民主党派，早已为此屡向世界人民申诉，向帝国主义提出严重抗议。现在全世界人民和国内同胞都清清楚楚认识了帝国主义的真相了。
    亲爱的侨胞们：你们在海外是与当地民族杂居在一起的。几百年来，华侨与当地人民早已建立了亲密的关系，在经济生活和社会生活方面，华侨不能脱离当地民族而独立生存。譬如在泰国、爪哇的华侨，有些已经世代相承，财产留在当地，亲戚血统也在当地，他们视当地为第二故乡。有些与当地人民通了婚，生男育女，成家立业，与当地人民结了血肉之缘。所以华侨在海外，尤其是南洋各处，早已与当地人民建立了和平友好亲密的关系。这是悠久的南洋华侨历史所造成的成果。我们应该珍惜它，爱护它，发扬它。这种民族间的平等，和平友好精神，早有孙中山先生提倡在前，现在毛主席所指示的新民主主义民族政策，和政协会议通过的共同纲领中的民族政策，也都是一贯地要实现世界各民族间的真正平等合作的。
    但是，帝国主义为了要实现侵略殖民地政策，要剥削殖民地人民，必然向人民力量进攻，必然施展其分化、离间与挑拨手段，指使当地反动派，利用战争混乱局面，屠杀抢劫，绑架华侨，企图离间华侨与当地民族的感情，造成民族间的裂痕。过去几年内在印尼和越南就发生过这类事件。侨胞们：我们在此应该指出，最近在南洋各地发生的或大或小的帝国主义直接指使下的当地反动派压迫和屠杀华侨的不幸事件，就是帝国主义一手造成的！
    现在中国人民民主革命即将在全国范围内取得胜利，中国人民的力量已经空前的强大起来，海外华侨在世界上的地位，因此会提高一步。各地民族的人民对待华侨，无疑地也会进一步的亲密友爱。我们华侨对待当地民族的人民也应该进一步的亲密友爱。同时对帝国主义在华侨中间的与在民族中间的挑拨离间阴谋毒计，我们应该提高警惕，向外揭破，这样才能团结华侨，团结当地人民中的国际友人，把人民民主统一战线扩大开展到当地人民中去。惟有巩固和扩大国际间和平民主统一战线，才能孤立帝国主义，争取人民的胜利；惟有当地人民得到真正解放，海外华侨才能得到真正的自由、平等和永久的和平生活。我们海外华侨能够这样做了，就能得到各当地民族真正的友谊，才能真正提高华侨的地位，才能得到永久自由和平的生活。
    亲爱蝗侨胞们：你们虽身在海外，与国内同胞还是休戚相关的，国内侨眷靠海外的接济，维持生活。华侨终岁勤劳，日夜所盼望的第一件事是家乡的安宁与进步。现在我们可以告诉你们：在侨眷集中地区，我们要用各种办法，保护地方秩序，保障侨眷生活。同时我们准备想办法把侨汇办好，使来自海外的侨眷给养，便利迅速地送到侨眷手里。现在中国银行和人民银行，在奥闽解放以后，全力注意办好侨汇。在汕头、厦门、广州等市，也准备先后设立华侨服务站，把侨汇工作做好。中央人民政府华侨事务委员会正在研究有利于华侨的适合实际的侨汇条例。在基本上我们必须根据新民主主义的经济政策，和共同纲领中的规定，要达到公私兼顾，和便利侨汇的目的。我们要照顾到侨眷的利益，并由政府的银行机关很好地管理和指导华侨的民信局、汇兑批局和银信局等等的业务。所以我们希望海外华侨，国内侨眷，和国内外的侨批局，都一致团结在人民政府的周围，通力合作，共同把侨汇办好，这是安定侨眷生活的必要措置。
    亲爱的侨胞们：今天是一九五○年的开始。这新的一年，在国内，将是解放战争的最后一年，同时也是开始转向国家建设的一年。全国人民将把帝国主义势力和蒋匪残余，在全国范围内，从根本消灭干净。以后就能够开始建设我们的国家了。我们热烈诚恳地欢迎海外华侨，本着革命的传统，加倍地帮助祖国，参加建设新中国的伟大光荣事业。祖国强盛了，你们的困难时间是会缩短的，困难是能够克服的。侨胞们：黑暗的日子不长了，黎明即在眼前。祝你们团结进步，和给你们各位贺年！
