Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 15th: TASS, New York, January 14th: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on January 12th to discuss the Soviet proposal to expel the representatives of the Kuomintang clique from the Security Council. At the beginning of the meeting, the Kuomintang representative was forced to yield the chair to the Cuban representative. After this, the Soviet representative, who had withdrawn on the 11th, re-attended the meeting.

	The remnant bandit representative was forced to relinquish the chair; the Soviet representative re-attended the meeting.

At the meeting, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France continued to cling to various fabricated excuses in an attempt to prolong the stay of the representatives of the Kuomintang clique in the Security Council.

The French representative, Chauvel, repeatedly put forward the unfounded arguments made by the US representative at the previous meeting, insisting that the Soviet demand for the immediate expulsion of the Kuomintang elements from the Security Council did not comply with the procedural rules of the Security Council. He said that he would vote against the Soviet delegation's proposal because the French government had "not yet reached a conclusion" on the situation in China.

The US representative, Gross, said that he would vote against the Soviet delegation's proposal on the grounds that the United States "recognizes the government authorized by Jiang Tingfu to attend the Security Council." He also said that his negative vote on the Soviet proposal would not mean the use of a veto.

Although the British representative, Jebb, did not publicly speak against the Soviet proposal, he claimed that it was "too early" to discuss the issue raised by the Soviet delegation!

The Indian representative did not mention his delegation's attitude towards the Soviet proposal at all. He merely spoke emptily about the need to revise and supplement the rules of procedure and expressed his support for the establishment of a special committee to study the issue.

At the end of the debate at this meeting, the Soviet representative, Malik, rose to speak. He criticized the guardians and protectors of the Kuomintang representatives and briefly explained the Soviet proposal to expel the Kuomintang representatives from the Security Council.

Referring to the Security Council's continued debate after the Soviet delegation's withdrawal on January 10th, Malik said that when the Soviet delegation attended the meeting and defended its proposal to expel the representatives of the Kuomintang clique from the Security Council, the representatives of the United States and Britain remained silent. However, after the Soviet delegation withdrew, they remembered Article 17 of the "Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Security Council" and began to insist that the Soviet delegation's actions did not comply with this rule.

The French representative also joined the chorus of the United States and Britain, mentioning the Security Council's collective responsibility to the United Nations.

	Malik stated: The Soviet Union firmly insists on expelling the remnant bandit representatives because they have become individuals who cannot represent anyone.

Malik continued: It is precisely because the Soviet delegation values the Security Council as an important United Nations body and takes into account the responsibility of maintaining international peace and security, that the Soviet delegation believes that it cannot participate in the work of the Security Council when the foundation of the reputation and prestige of not only the Security Council but also the entire United Nations is being undermined. To have an irresponsible individual in the Security Council who does not represent anyone, to have an agent of the remnant Kuomintang reactionaries who has been completely crushed, will only undermine the reputation and prestige of the Security Council and the United Nations.

Today, the US representative put forward a new argument, insisting that the Soviet Union insists on removing the representatives of the Kuomintang clique from the Security Council only because the Soviet Union recognized the new government of China and severed diplomatic relations with the Kuomintang clique.

To put it mildly, this is confusing the facts. The Soviet Union insists on removing the representatives of the Kuomintang clique from the Security Council because this person does not represent China or the Chinese people here. Diplomatic recognition or non-recognition of a certain government has no decisive significance for the issue of the right of this government to send representatives to participate in United Nations bodies, including the Security Council.

Everyone knows that not all members of the Security Council have full diplomatic relations with each other.

The issue of expelling the representatives of the Kuomintang clique from the Security Council was raised by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The Soviet government supports the statement of the People's Republic of China on this issue, and the Soviet side insists on expelling the representatives of the Kuomintang clique from the Security Council.

Malik continued: As for citing procedural rules on the issue we are discussing, that is obviously untenable and groundless. The issue is not whether the authority of the Kuomintang clique representative of China in the Security Council has been disputed, nor whether his authority is valid. The issue is that this gentleman has no authority, no legal right or basis to attend the Security Council at all. Because the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has sent a telegram to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the President of the General Assembly, and the governments of the members of the Security Council, insisting on expelling this gentleman from the Security Council on the grounds that his attendance at the Security Council is illegal.

	From the point of view of international law standards, the Security Council cannot tolerate the illegal representatives of bandits.

Malik then quoted the telegram from the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, pointing out that this telegram clearly stated that the Kuomintang representatives had been deprived of all authority and had no legal right to remain in the Security Council.

The Soviet delegation already asked everyone to pay attention at the last meeting of the Security Council: After half of the members of the Security Council have severed diplomatic relations with the remnant Kuomintang clique, it is abnormal for the Security Council to continue to work under the chairmanship of the representatives of this clique and allow him to participate in the Security Council.

Malik said: I only said half of the members of the Security Council because I did not include the representatives of the Kuomintang clique.

However, if we consider that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, which represents China and the will of the Chinese people, demands that this gentleman be expelled from the Security Council, then actually six of the eleven members of the Security Council (including China) cannot tolerate the continued presence of the representatives of the Kuomintang clique in the Security Council from the point of view of international law standards.

Indeed, as already pointed out at the last meeting of the Security Council, although some countries have broken off relations with the remnants of the Kuomintang clique and established diplomatic relations with the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, they have not yet decided to break off ties with the Kuomintang clique. We see a rather strange sight. The governments of some countries use the hands of their foreign ministers to sign the notes of recognition of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, while on the other hand, they use the hands of their representatives to the Security Council to vote in support of the representatives of the Kuomintang clique with whom they have already announced the severance of diplomatic relations, and to speak in favor of his staying in the Security Council.

It is best for the British and Americans to judge what the British call this behavior. As for the Russian language, this action is called a two-faced policy, a hypocritical policy. However, this policy of the ruling groups of some countries, especially that of Britain, is not surprising. The ruling group of this country has long acquired the notorious reputation of the two-faced god Janus.

	In international affairs, the Security Council must take the will of the Central People's Government of New China as the sole criterion.

Malik said: Any reference to procedural rules is unfounded on such an important international issue. The only criterion for the Security Council to examine this issue and make a decision on this issue must be the will expressed by the government that represents China and the Chinese people in international affairs and in relations with other countries. Such a government is the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

Malik concluded: The Soviet delegation supports the statement of the government of the People's Republic of China and believes that the participation of the agents of the Kuomintang clique in the Security Council is illegal. It cannot agree to allow this agent to remain in the Security Council, let alone to serve as the chairman of the Security Council.

### 苏代表在安理会讨论时  重申支持周外长声明  痛斥美英法捏造借口混淆事实

    苏代表在安理会讨论时
    重申支持周外长声明
    痛斥美英法捏造借口混淆事实
    【新华社北京十五日电】塔斯社纽约十四日讯：联合国安全理事会一月十二日举行会议，讨论苏联所提关于把国民党集团的代表开除出安全理事会的议案。在会议开始时，国民党代表被迫把主席的地位让给古巴代表。在这之后，于十一日退席的苏联代表，重又出席会议。
            残匪代表被迫让出主席地位，苏联代表重新出席会议。
    在会上发言的美、英、法代表们，继续死抓住各种捏造的借口，以图延长国民党集团的代表留在安全理事会中的时间。
    法国代表乔维尔重复地提出美国代表在前一次会议上所提出的毫无根据的论断，硬说苏联所提关于立即把国民党分子开除出安全理事会的要求，不符合安全理事会的程序规则。他说：他将投票反对苏联代表团的提案，因为法国政府对中国的形势“仍未作出结论”。
    美国代表格罗斯说：他将投票反对苏联代表团的提案，理由是：美国“承认受权蒋延黻出席安全理事会的政府”。他并说，他对苏联提案所投的反对票，将不意味着使用否决权。
    英国代表贾德干虽然未公开发言反对苏联提案，但称：目前讨论苏联代表团所提的问题，“为时尚属过早”！
    印度代表一点也没有说到他的代表团对苏联提案所持的态度。他仅仅空空洞洞地说了一些需要修正与补充程序规则的话，并表示赞成建立一个特别委员会，研究这个问题。
    在这次会议辩论结束时，苏联代表马立克起立发言。他批评了国民党代表的监护人和保护者，并简略说明苏联所提关于把国民党代表开除出安全理事会的要求。
    马立克在述及苏联代表团于一月十日退席后安全理事会所继续进行的辩论时称：当苏联代表团出席会议并维护它所提出的开除国民党集团代表出安全理事会的提案时，美英的代表们默无一言。但在苏联代表团退席之后，他们却想起了“安全理事会暂行程序规则”第十七条，并开始硬说什么苏联代表团的行动不符合这个规则。
    法国的代表也加入了英美的合唱，他提到安全理事会对联合国的集体责任。
            马立克发言称：苏联坚主开除残匪代表，是因它已成了不能代表
        任何人的个人。
    马立克继称：正是由于苏联代表团重视安全理事会这样一个重要的联合国机构，并顾及维持国际和平与安全的责任，苏联代表团才认为：当不仅安全理事会而且全部联合国机构的声誉与威望的基础都受到破坏的时候，它不可能参加安理会的工作。在安理会里面有一个不代表任何人的不负责任的个人在内，有一个已被完全粉碎了的国民党反动集团残余的代理人在内，这只会破坏安理会和联合国的声誉和威望。
    今天美国代表提出了新的论调，硬说苏联所以坚主撤消安理会中的国民党集团的代表，只是因为苏联承认了中国的新政府，并断绝了与国民党集团的外交关系。
    说得温和些，这是混淆事实。苏联所以坚主撤消安理会中的国民党集团的代表，是因为这个人在这里既不代表中国、也不代表中国人民。对某一个政府的外交上的承认或不承认，对于这一政府派代表参加联合国机构——安理会亦在其内——的权利问题，没有决定的意义。
    大家知道，安理会的理事国之间，并不是完全都有外交关系的。
    开除国民党集团的代表出安理会的问题，是中华人民共和国中央人民政府所提出的。苏联政府支持中华人民共和国关于这一问题的声明，而且苏联方面坚持开除国民党集团的代表出安理会。
    马立克继称：至于在我们所讨论的问题上引用程序规则，那是显然站不住脚和毫无根据的。问题并不在于对安理会中国民党集团代表的权力是否已经发生了争执，也不在于他的权力是否有效。问题在于这位先生根本毫无权力、毫无法律上的权利和根据来出席安理会。因为中华人民共和国中央人民政府已致电联合国秘书长、大会的主席和安理会各理事国政府，坚持把这位先生开除出安理会，理由是他出席安理会是非法的。
            从国际法标准的观点出发，安理会不能容留匪帮非法代表。
    马立克接着引用中华人民共和国中央人民政府的电报，指出这个电报清清楚楚说明国民党代表已经被剥夺了一切权力，他毫无合法的权利留在安理会。
    苏联代表团在安理会上次会议上，就已要求大家注意：在安理会已有一半的理事国与国民党的集团残余断绝外交关系之后，安理会却继续在这个集团的代表任主席之下进行工作，并且让他参加安理会，这种情形是不正常的。
    马立克说：我只说安理会的一半会员，是因为我没有把国民党集团的代表计算在内。
    但是，如果考虑到代表中国和代表中国人民意志的中华人民共和国中央人民政府要求把这位先生开除出安理会，那么，安理会十一个理事国当中实际上有六个国家（包括中国在内）从国际法标准的观点出发，不能容忍国民党集团的代表继续留在安理会。
    的确，正如在安理会上次会议上所已经指出的，某些国家虽然和国民党集团的残余断绝了关系，而且和中华人民共和国中央人民政府建立了外交关系，但是还没有决定与国民党集团割断联系。我们看到颇为奇怪的景象。某些国家的政府用他们的外交部长的手，在承认中华人民共和国中央人民政府的照会上签字，而另一方面，又用它们驻安理会代表的手，投票支持业已宣布与之断绝了外交关系的国民党集团的代表，并且发言赞成他留在安理会。
    英国话把这种行为叫做什么，最好让英国人和美国人去判断。至于俄国话，这种行动就叫做两面政策、伪善政策。然而，某些国家的统治集团的这种政策，特别是英国的这种政策，并不足为奇。这个国家的统治集团早已取得了两面神秦纳斯的臭名。
            在国际事务上，安理会必须以新中国中央人民政府的意志为唯一
        准则。
    马立克说：在如此重要的国际问题上对程序规则作任何援用都是没有根据的。安理会审查这个问题，并对这个问题作出决定的唯一准则，必须是在国际事务上以及在对其他国家的关系上，代表着中国和中国人民的政府所表示的意志。这样的政府就是中华人民共和国中央人民政府。
    马立克结语说：苏联代表团支持中华人民共和国政府的声明，并认为国民党集团代理人的参加安理会是非法的，它不能同意让这个代理人留在安理会，更谈不上由他来担任安理会的主席。
