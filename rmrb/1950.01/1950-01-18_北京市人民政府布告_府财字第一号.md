    Announcement of the Beijing Municipal People's Government
    Finance Document No. 1

    1.  The "Provisional Measures for the Collection of Real Estate Tax in Beijing Municipality" were promulgated and implemented on December 1, 1949.

    2.  The real estate tax for the year 1949 will be collected starting from the date of this announcement. All taxpayers shall pay to the designated banks in the municipality within ten days of receiving the notice. Those who fail to pay within the time limit will be penalized according to regulations.

    3.  In addition to the regular real estate tax, an education and health surcharge of 30% will be levied, uniformly calculated based on the equivalent price of millet at 800 yuan per jin.

    4.  Land within the city used for growing crops should be subject to agricultural tax according to the "Provisional Measures for Agricultural Progressive Tax." However, after investigation, the use of agricultural land in the urban area is complex, mostly managed in a decentralized manner. After harvest, the produce is quickly consumed, with very little grain stored. Moreover, land price tax has been levied in the urban area in the past. If re-registration and re-evaluation of property are carried out to change to agricultural tax, the masses will face many difficulties. Therefore, real estate tax will still be levied this year instead of agricultural tax.

    5.  Those who do not have title deeds or hold white deeds and have not completed the registration procedures, resulting in missed land price tax payments, must voluntarily declare and pay taxes to the Finance Bureau before January 31, 1950. Previous tax omissions will be leniently handled without further investigation.

    6.  The names and addresses of the collecting banks are listed below for your compliance.

                                      Mayor: Nie Rongzhen
                                    Deputy Mayors: Zhang Youyu

    北京市人民政府布告
    府财字第一号
    一、本市地产税征收暂行办法业于一九四九年十二月一日公布施行。
    二、一九四九年度地产税定于布告之日起开始征收，各纳税义务人于接到通知书十日内向本市各指定银行缴纳，逾期不缴者，照章处罚。
    三、于地产税正税外附征教育卫生费百分之三十，统按税额小米每斤八○○元折款征收。
    四、本市城内种植农作物土地，本应依照农业累进税暂行办法征农业税，但经调查结果，城区农地使用情形复杂，大都分散经营，收获之后，随即消耗，存粮甚少，且过去城区均征地价税，若重新登记评产，改征农业税，群众困难很多，故本年仍征地产税，不征农业税。
    五、凡无契或持有白契业户，而未办理登记手续，致漏交地价税者，亦限于一九五○年一月三十一日以前，自动向财政局申报纳税，以往漏税，从宽不究。
    六、兹将收款银行名称地址附后，希即一体遵照。
                                      市长  聂荣臻
                                    副市长  张友渔
                                            吴晗
