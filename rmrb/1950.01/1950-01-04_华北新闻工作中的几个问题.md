Several Issues in North China's News Work
    Pan Shi

    In North China, as in other old liberated areas, news work has accumulated some basic experiences of people's news work through more than ten years of practice. However, these experiences have not been systematically summarized to further improve them, and in particular, there is a failure to adapt to the current more favorable new conditions, resulting in the current development not advancing rapidly, but showing some degree of stagnation. Here, I would like to introduce some of the more urgent issues, which have been basically resolved or are being resolved, for the reference of comrades in various regions.

    (I) The Division of Labor Between Local Newspapers and Central Newspapers? This is an urgent issue that needs to be resolved, but it has not been well resolved in most provinces and regions in North China. Originally, the task of the central newspapers was to reflect and guide the work in the national scope; and the task of the local newspapers was to specifically reflect and guide local work and the lives of local people, under the overall national situation and tasks, and based on the specific conditions and needs of the province and city. The newspapers in various parts of North China were originally started as local newspapers, and it should be said that they were already familiar with this situation. In fact, some local newspapers used to be very well-run (such as the "Jizhong Guide" and "Taihang Xinhua Daily"). But under today's new conditions, these local newspapers, after seeing various national newspapers, unconsciously want to "catch up" with the major newspapers: the layout is enlarged, and the titles are also enlarged. Instead of consciously helping the central newspapers in their distribution in the local area, and strengthening their own localization to make them more suitable for local cadres and the masses to read, they are afraid that the central newspapers will "grab their territory", and desperately "compete" with the central newspapers, vying for time and tricks. If you have something, I have something too. As a result, the locality is greatly weakened, and naturally, catching up with the central newspapers has not succeeded.

    When the "Pingyuan Daily" was founded and the "Hebei Daily" was revised this time, they were determined to correct the above shortcomings with the help of the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. Here, I would like to introduce the experience of "Hebei Daily". As a local newspaper, "Hebei Daily" still has some shortcomings, but it is basically well-run. Its experience is: First, prominently publish local news (local news accounts for about five-eighths of all materials) to guide local work. For this purpose, its local reports closely revolve around the key guiding points of the provincial party committee in each period to organize manuscripts, and at the same time strengthen criticism and self-criticism of the work, to give play to the guiding role that the party newspaper should have. Second, systematically develop correspondents and improve the local communication network. This is the basis for the newspaper to obtain sufficient materials. "Hebei Daily" originally had 10,000 correspondents, and those with good quality were hired as special correspondents and special reporters. In addition, each special district has a branch of the news agency (after the news agency and the newspaper office were separated, the branch still serves as the communication station of the newspaper office), and each department has a communication committee and a communication group. This is an organizational work that is extremely necessary to run a newspaper well. Third, it is easier to select and edit carefully and run the newspaper well by running a small four-page newspaper based on the existing number and quality of cadres. Because the layout is small and the titles are small, the editing format is easy to control, and the work will not be passive and the layout will not be empty due to insufficient manuscripts. Fourth, the publication of Xinhua News Agency dispatches is currently the main key for some local newspapers that they believe cannot be localized. They believe that if the Xinhua News Agency dispatches are published, the local manuscripts will inevitably be reduced. Therefore, some localities simply do not publish major current affairs news and the experiences of neighboring regions, or publish very little. This is naturally wrong. On this point, the experience of "Hebei Daily" is: according to the needs of local cadres and people, the method of carefully selecting and abridging is adopted, and the things that readers need to know and must know are popularized. For the lengthy speeches in Xinhua News Agency dispatches, extracts of the main points are issued, and the full text is printed separately into loose-leaf pages or pamphlets and distributed to cadres above the county level. In this way, the contradiction between the small layout and many news items, and the needs of cadres, is easily resolved. This method is basically good. But "Hebei Daily" also has shortcomings in this regard. The first is that the abridgment results in the fact that important current affairs news is not prominent on the layout. This is wrong. Abridgment should not reduce its importance. Second, localization is not about not absorbing the experiences of neighboring regions, nor should it be mistaken for ruralization, and not pay attention to the industrial and commercial reports of small and medium-sized cities. These shortcomings are hoped that "Hebei Daily" and newspapers in various parts of North China will continue to work hard to create more perfect experiences.

    (II) The Construction of Broadcasting Undertakings: Broadcasting undertakings in North China have a relatively short history in the history of news, and there is little experience. How to do it better, various places are still exploring. Due to insufficient summarization and dissemination of its past experience, some places cannot even find the way. But today's conditions are much better than when the first radio station (Handan Station) was created in September 1946. If we base ourselves on the experience of operating and creating under difficult conditions in the past, absorb the good experiences of various parts of the country today, and make full use of all the existing favorable conditions, we will definitely do better.

    To run a radio station well, according to the experience of various places, we must pay attention to the following points: (1) The construction of the radio station itself: Today, machines and equipment are easier to purchase, and there are more technical talents than before. Therefore, we must build independently in these areas, and no longer rely on the radio departments of the troops, let alone complain that they do not help. In addition, editing and interviewing must also be separated from the newspaper office and the news agency. In the past, it was unavoidable to combine them together. Today, they must be separated. (2) Help the audience listen: With a radio station, but the masses do not have a radio, or do not know how to listen to and repair the radio, the radio station is still equivalent to nothing. Some cities (such as Taiyuan and Zhangjiakou) have only a few radios, mostly placed in institutions and the homes of senior cadres, and there are very few citizens, let alone factories, and there are none in the countryside. This is an urgent problem to be solved. Therefore, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee once sent cadres to Beijing and Tianjin to buy radios for the masses, and designated each county to send a large number of people to receive training so that they could learn to record and repair machines. Their experience proves that the cultural level of recorders cannot be too low, otherwise they cannot copy and record news. (3) The most important thing is how to use the radio station to make it an effective tool for propaganda and education. In this regard, Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station has done a better job. Their experience is: First, we must organize responsible comrades from various groups and institutions and all sectors of society, such as workers and soldiers, to broadcast and organize the masses to listen, turning the radio station into a public forum. For example, when comrades from the Preparatory Committee of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions broadcast, 50,000 to 60,000 people listened every day. When the director of the Municipal Trade Union broadcast, some factories had a listening rate of 95% of the total number of employees. Second, establish a broadcasting system, with a broadcasting station in each industry, whose task is to organize the audience to listen to lectures and discussions, collect questions, and contact the broadcasting station to expand the work of the broadcasting station to various factories and institutions. Third, improve and increase cultural and entertainment programs, which is a very important way to unite the broad masses of listeners. Cultural and entertainment programs at Tianjin Radio Station account for 49% of all programs. Fourth, set up a radio repair service department to install radios and repair parts for the masses at low prices, which not only solves the technical difficulties of listeners, but also establishes the production of their own organs.

    (III) The Separation of Newspaper Offices and News Agencies: This is also a problem that has not been solved for a long time and now urgently needs to be solved. Although news agencies in various parts of North China have a relatively long history, without exception, they were initially concurrently held by the newspaper office, and were actually the interview department (mostly called the communications department) of the newspaper office. Due to the different tasks and businesses of the two, except in very few cases where the unified leader can try to properly take care of the work of both parties, generally, one is neglected. Sometimes, if the leading cadres of the communications department are strong, they will desperately pull the strong cadres of the newspaper office to the communications department, and send manuscripts to the headquarters or mainly to the headquarters, which makes the manuscripts and editing of the newspaper office feel very difficult. In most cases, the news agency becomes a "vassal" of the newspaper office. Recently, the work of many local news agencies in North China has simply relied on clipping newspaper proofs to cope with, and even the staffing has become a formality. For a long time, many comrades have always said that there are few cadres, and both sides will be weakened after separation. This certainly has its reasons, but as long as we are determined to separate the institutions, the cadres will gradually be replenished. The situation after the radio station was separated is like this. It should be noted that when separating, the leadership must be fair and reasonable, and appropriate foundations should be given to cadres, materials, books, etc., and should not be "kicked out" casually. Recently, "Hebei Daily" and Xinhua News Agency's Hebei branch were separated, and several top cadres were drawn to the branch, which is very good. Some people advocate that as long as the business establishment is separated, it does not matter even if they still live in the same place and have the same leadership, thinking that this is only a formal issue, which is actually wrong. But separation must be done well. Whether in the process of separation or in the future, we must pay attention to each other's relationship and achieve unity, which is very important.

    (IV) The Training and Improvement of News Cadres: Since the Japanese surrender, with the expansion of the new liberated areas, the North China region has sent batches of news cadres to work in the new areas, which shows that North China has made achievements in training news cadres. Facts have also proved that the more willing to send old cadres out, the more new cadres can continue to grow; on the contrary, some places are unwilling to send cadres or only send new cadres out, and it is difficult to improve the cadres.

    For a long time, in the many news organizations in North China, not enough attention has been paid to giving cadres the opportunity to educate and learn, which is a very serious problem. News work is relatively busy and tense, and some leading comrades often mistakenly neglect the education of cadres because of this. We believe that in addition to the existing news schools, journalism departments in universities, news cadre training classes, etc. as specialized education for news cadres, news organizations must have after-school learning. Comrade Shi Ximin once said painfully in a summary of "Nanjing Xinhua Daily": "Rather than publish half a newspaper less, we must strengthen cadre learning." Although we do not necessarily have to "publish half a newspaper less" in terms of methods, this spirit of paying attention to learning is indeed worthy of emulation in various parts of North China. Countless experiences have proved that any organization without an atmosphere of learning will lack vigor and will fall into bureaucracy and unprincipled disputes. What should be learned? How to learn? This naturally needs to be resolved. But as long as we are determined to learn, these problems are not difficult to solve. Some areas have already explored some experiences, such as "Pingyuan Daily", after the responsible comrades of the party committee and the newspaper office review the manuscripts, if it needs to be rewritten, they will designate relevant documents and let the editors and reporters learn and discuss in conjunction with specific problems, and then rewrite the manuscripts, so that cadres can develop the habit of frequently reading documents and books. In this way, everyone feels that the help is great, and it is often helpful to convey the intentions of the Communist Party's leading organs, invite provincial party and government responsible comrades to report and have discussions (Hebei Daily once a week) to improve cadres and improve work. News workers need current affairs learning and policy learning, especially theoretical learning. If news workers in North China can seriously finish reading the twelve books of "Cadres Must Read", the people's news work in North China will inevitably change its face.

    (V) The Leadership of News Work: Generally speaking, the leading organs in various parts of North China attach importance to news work, and the leadership is gradually strengthening, such as Hebei Province, which leads very well. But there are indeed individual places where the leadership is very irregular. And it should be said that the specific leadership of news workers in all aspects of politics, business, life, and study is very superficial in most places. We hope that the leading organs in various places will pay attention to and improve this phenomenon. On the other hand, news workers should actively make the leading organs specifically understand our situation and obtain their specific leadership and help, which is also a matter that should be paid attention to. Tianjin Radio Station does not complain about the lack of help from the leading organs, but uses the achievements of its own work to make the leading organs pay attention to radio work and give specific help. This spirit is worthy of emulation in various places.

    华北新闻工作中的几个问题
    磐石
    新闻工作之在华北，和在其他老解放区一样，经过十几年的锻炼，已经积累了人民新闻工作的若干基本经验。但由于对这些经验还没有能系统的加以总结，使之更加提高，特别是由于不善于适应目前更加有利的新的条件，以致目前工作的发展不是迅速前进，而表现着某种程度的迟滞。这里我只想就其中较为迫切，而且基本上已获解决或正在解决中的问题，加以介绍，以供各地同志参考。
    （一）地方报纸与中央报纸的分工问题？这是一个急需解决而在华北多数省区尚未很好解决的问题。本来，中央报纸的任务，是反映与指导全国范围的工作；而地方报纸的任务，则是在全国总的形势与任务下，根据本省本市的具体情况与需要，具体地反映与指导本地工作和本地群众生活。华北各地的报纸，本来就是由地方报纸办起的，应该说是早已熟悉了这种情况，而且事实上，有些地方报纸过去办的很出色（如冀中导报、太行新华日报等）。可是在今天新的条件下，这些地方报纸看见各种全国性的报纸以后，便不知不觉地要向大报“看齐”：版面改大了，标题也放大了。不是一面有意识地帮助中央报纸在本地的发行，一面加强自己的地方化，使之更适宜于本地干部和群众阅读，而是怕中央报“抢了自己的地盘”，拚命和中央报纸“竞赛”，争时间，争花样，你有个什么我也有个什么。结果，地方性大大减弱了，赶中央报纸自然也没有赶上。
    这次平原日报创刊和河北日报改版时，他们都曾在中共中央华北局宣传部的帮助之下，决心纠正上述缺点。这里我想介绍一下河北日报的经验。当做一个地方报纸来说，河北日报虽然直至现在仍有某些缺点，但基本上是办得较好的。它的经验是：第一、显著地登载地方消息（地方消息约占全部材料八分之五），来指导当地工作。为此目的，它的地方报道就紧紧地围绕着省委各个时期的指导重点去组织稿件，同时加强对工作的批评与自我批评，来发挥党报应有的指导作用。第二、有计划地发展通讯员，健全地方通讯网。这是报纸获得充足材料的基础。河北日报原有通讯员一万人，其中质量好的，则聘为特约通讯员与特约记者。此外，每专区尚设有通讯社支社（通讯社与报社分立后，支社仍做报社的通讯站），各部门则设通讯委员会及通讯组。这是办好一个报纸极其需要的一种组织工作。第三、根据现有干部数量质量，办四开四版的小报，比较容易做到精选精编，把报办好。因为版面小、标题小，编排形式也易于操纵，不至因稿件不足，使工作被动，版面空洞。第四、新华社电讯的登载，是目前若干地方报纸认为不能地方化的主要关键。他们认为如果把新华社电讯登载出来，则地方稿必然减少，因之，有的地方报索性就不登大的时事消息和邻区经验，或者登的很少。这自然是不对的。在这一点上，河北日报的经验是：根据当地干部和人民的需要，采用了精选缩编的办法，把读者需要知道的，必须知道的，加以通俗化。对于新华社电讯中的长篇言论，则摘发要点，全文另印成活页或小册子，发给县级以上的干部。这样，就很容易地解决了版面小而消息多、干部需要多的矛盾。这个方法基本上是好的。但河北日报在这问题上也还有缺点。第一是缩编的结果，使重要的时事消息，在版面上不突出。这是不对的。缩编不应当降低它的重要性。第二、地方化不是不吸收邻区的经验，也不应误认地方化为农村化，而不注意中小城市的工商业报导。这些缺点希望河北日报和华北各地报纸继续努力，创造更完善的经验。
    （二）广播事业的建设问题：广播事业在华北新闻史上是比较年轻的，经验还少。究竟如何办的更好，各地都还在摸索。由于对它过去的经验总结和传播不够，有的地方连门径也摸不着。但今天的条件比之一九四六年九月创设第一个广播电台（邯郸台）时，已经好多了。倘若我们根据过去在困难条件下经营缔造的经验，再吸收今天全国各地好的经验，并充分运用现有的一切有利条件，一定会办的更好。
    要想办好一个广播电台，根据各地经验必须注意以下几点：（１）广播台本身的建设：今天机器器材比过去容易购置，技术人材比以前多了，因之在这些方面必须单独建设，不要再依靠部队电务部门，更不应埋怨他们不帮助。另外，编辑采访，也必须和报社通讯社分开。过去合在一起是不得已的，今天必须分开。（２）帮助听众收听的工作：有了广播台，但是群众没有收音机，或者不会收听和修理收音机广播台仍然等于虚设。有的城市（如太原、张家口）只有少数收音机，大都放在机关里和高级干部家里，市民有的很少，工厂更少，农村完全没有。这是急需解决的问题。河北省委因此曾派干部到京津代群众买收音机，并且指定各县大量地派人受训，使他们学会录音和修理机器。他们的经验证明，录音员不能文化水平太低，否则不能抄纪录新闻。（３）最主要的还是如何运用广播台使之成为有效的宣传教育工具的问题。在这方面，天津人民广播电台作得较好。他们的经验是：第一，必须组织各团体各机关负责同志及各界如工人士兵等来播讲，并经过他们组织群众收听，把广播电台变成一个公共的讲台。如天津总工会筹备会同志播讲，每天收听者有五、六万人。市政工会主任播讲，有些工厂收听者达到职工总数百分之九十五。第二，建立一个广播系统，一个行业设一个广播站，其任务是组织听众听讲和讨论，搜集问题，并与广播台联系，把广播台的工作扩大到各工厂各机关中去。第三，改进与增加文化娱乐节目，这是团结广大听众的一个很重要的办法。天津广播电台文娱节目就占全部节目百分之四十九。第四，设立无线电修理服务部，给群众廉价安装收音机，修理机件，既解决听众技术困难，又建立了自己机关的生产。
    （三）报社与通讯社的分立问题：这也是一个长期没解决而现在迫切需要解决的问题。华北各地通讯社虽然已有较长的历史，但毫无例外的一开始就是由报社兼任，实际是报社的采访部（大多数叫通讯部）。由于两者的任务和业务不同，除极个别的情况下统一领导人能够设法适当照顾双方的工作外，一般都是有所偏废。有时通讯部的领导干部强，就把报社强的干部拚命拉到通讯部去，面向总社或主要给总社发稿，使报社的稿件与编辑大感困难。而在多数的情形下，则是通讯社变成报社的“附庸”。最近华北许多地方通讯社的工作，简直依靠剪报纸大样来应付，甚至人员的编制也已名存实亡。许多同志长时间以来总是说干部少，分开后两边都要削弱。这固然有它的道理，但只要决心把机构分开后，干部就会逐渐地充实起来。广播电台分出后的情形就是如此。应当注意的是：在分的时候，领导上必须做到公平合理，无论干部、资料、图书等都应给以适当的底子，不可“一脚踢出去”了事。最近河北日报和新华社河北分社分开，就抽了几个头等干部给了分社，这是很好的。有人主张只要业务编制分开，即使仍住一处同一领导都无关系，以为这只是形式上的问题，这其实是不对的。但是分必须分好。无论在分的过程中或在以后，必须注意彼此的关系，做到团结，这是很重要的。
    （四）新闻干部的培养与提高的问题：日本投降以来，随着新解放区的扩大，华北区曾一批一批地派遣出好多新闻干部到新区去工作，这说明华北在培养新闻干部上是有成绩的。事实也证明：愈是肯派老干部出去的，就愈能不断生长起新的干部来；反之，有些地方不肯抽干部或者只抽新干部出去，则干部的提高很难。
    长时间以来，华北区较多的新闻机关中，对给予干部以教育和学习的机会重视不够，这是一个很严重的问题。新闻工作较为忙碌与紧张，某些领导同志往往就因此错误地忽视干部的教育。我们以为，除了现有新闻学校，大学里的新闻系，新闻干部训练班等作为专门教育新闻干部外，新闻机关必须有业余学习。石西民同志在一次关于南京新华日报的总结中，曾经痛切地说：“宁肯少出半张报，也要加强干部学习。”虽然在办法上我们不必一定要“少出半张报”，但这种重视学习的精神确实是值得华北各地效法的。无数经验证明：任何机关没有学习的空气，就会缺乏朝气，就会陷于事务主义和无原则的纠纷。究应学习些什么？如何学习？这自然需要解决。但只要决心学习，这些问题是不难解决的。有些地区已经摸索了一些经验，比如平原日报在党委及报社负责同志审稿后，如需改写，就指定有关文件，让编辑记者结合具体问题进行学习讨论，然后改写稿件，使干部养成经常翻阅文件和读书的习惯。这样，大家感觉帮助很大，经常传达共产党领导机关的意图，邀请省级党政负责同志来报告、座谈（河北日报每周一次），对提高干部、改进工作都有益处。新闻工作者需要时事学习和政策学习，尤其需要理论学习。如果华北的新闻工作者都能把十二本《干部必读》书认真读完，华北的人民新闻工作必然会改变一个面目。
    （五）新闻工作的领导问题：一般说，华北各地领导机关，对于新闻工作是重视的，领导也是日渐加强的，如河北省就领导的很好。但确有个别地方，领导很不经常。而且应当说，对新闻工作者的政治、业务、生活、学习各方面的具体领导，则大多数地方是很不深入的。这种现象，我们希望各地领导机关予以注意和改进。另一方面新闻工作者主动地使领导机关具体地了解我们的情况，并取得他们的具体领导与帮助，也是应当注意的一件事。天津广播台不埋怨领导机关的帮助不足，而用自己工作的成绩来使领导机关注意到广播工作，并给以具体帮助，这种精神，值得各地效法。
