    Provisional Rules for the Management of Transactions of the Beijing Grain Exchange
    Article 1 All grain transactions conducted within the Beijing Grain Exchange (hereinafter referred to as the Exchange) shall be governed by these rules, unless otherwise provided by central laws and regulations.
    Article 2 All public and private factories, stores, firms, etc. that are engaged in the grain sales industry or engaged in processing and manufacturing using grain as raw materials and hold a business license from the Beijing Municipal Commercial Bureau (or the former Industry and Commerce Bureau) or the Industrial Bureau may apply to the Exchange for regular admission to the Exchange.
    Article 3 Those who meet one of the following conditions and are approved by the Exchange may be temporarily admitted to the Exchange. ① Merchants holding a business license from the Beijing Municipal Commercial Bureau (or the former Industry and Commerce Bureau) and engaged in the grain sales industry. ② Legitimate grain merchants from other regions or townships who hold certification documents from the local competent authority or are certified by a legitimate business in this city. ③ Cooperatives in this city holding a certificate from the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and farmers' cooperatives in various places holding a certificate from their cooperative.
    In addition to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, other persons who need to be temporarily admitted to the Exchange must be approved by the Commercial Bureau.
    Article 4 Those who are permitted to enter the Exchange for transactions will be issued an admission card by the Exchange, the format of which will be formulated separately. The aforementioned admission card shall not be lent or transferred. If it is lost, a statement must be published in the newspaper for three days declaring it invalid, and then apply for a replacement with a store guarantee and the newspaper.
    Article 5 Admission cards are divided into regular and temporary types. Regular admission cards are valid for one year and will be reissued upon expiration. They will be reviewed every six months. Temporary admission cards are valid for a period determined as needed.
    Article 6 Those who enter the Exchange for transactions must wear their admission card, otherwise they will not be allowed to enter the Exchange. During transactions, they shall conduct buying and selling according to the nature of their business. Transportation and sales businesses are only allowed to sell goods, retail businesses are only allowed to buy and sell, and manufacturing or processing businesses are only allowed to buy raw materials and sell finished products. However, if it is truly for the exchange of goods, it may be changed with the approval of the Commercial Bureau.
    Article 7 Those who enter the Exchange for transactions may buy and sell directly, or entrust the Exchange's business personnel to introduce buying and selling. The price shall be negotiated publicly and freely by the buyer and seller without restriction. However, when the transaction is completed, it must be reported to the business personnel and two copies of the transaction form must be filled out, which shall be sealed by the buyer, seller, and business personnel together. One copy shall be kept by the Exchange for file, and one copy shall be given to the buyer for safekeeping.
    Article 8 After the transaction is completed, the seller shall submit a sample of the goods to the Exchange and the seller, and the buyer shall present the transaction form to pay for and pick up the goods on the same day. After the goods are picked up, the seller shall indicate the word "paid" on the transaction form and return it to the buyer for safekeeping. If the quality of the goods is found to be inconsistent or other disputes occur during the pick-up, and they cannot be resolved by themselves, the Exchange shall be responsible for mediation, but shall not be liable for compensation for losses.
    Article 9 Those who enter the Exchange for transactions shall pay a handling fee to the Exchange. The method of collection will be formulated separately.
    Article 10 Those who enter the Exchange for transactions shall not engage in illegal activities such as buying and selling short, futures trading, speculation, rumor-mongering, price gouging, or fraud, and shall maintain public order within the Exchange.
    Article 11 The Exchange has the right to send personnel at any time to inspect and inquire about the transaction records of those who enter the Exchange for transactions.
    Article 12 Those who violate the provisions of these rules may be given a sanction by the Exchange to suspend or revoke their qualification for entering the Exchange for transactions. Those with serious circumstances shall be sent to the competent authority for handling.
    Article 13 Those who enter the Exchange for transactions shall lose their qualification for entering the Exchange and shall surrender their admission card if one of the following circumstances occurs.
    1. Closing down. 2. Having their qualification for entering the Exchange revoked by the Exchange. 3. Expiration of the admission card.
