Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: TASS Moscow dispatch: December 30, 1949, was the 150th anniversary of the Moscow "Three Mountains" Textile Factory. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR specially awarded the Order of Lenin to this outstanding enterprise, and awarded prizes to many workers in the factory, because the factory workers had victoriously completed the task assigned by the government of manufacturing textiles.

　　In commemoration of this day, *Pravda* published a special article recounting the glorious history of the factory, stating: The textile workers of this factory are the inheritors of the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Russian working class. In December 1905, under the leadership of the Bolsheviks, they bravely rose up in the Red Presnya fortress in Moscow. During the Civil War, many workers from the "Three Mountains" factory joined the Red Army. In the years of peaceful construction, they remained true to the glorious revolutionary tradition and set an example of selfless labor. In the First Five-Year Plan, the workers of the "Three Mountains" factory contributed 655 million meters of textiles to the country. Even more was produced in the Second Five-Year Plan. In the days following Hitler Germany's perfidious attack on the Soviet Union, the factory's entire production was switched to wartime production. The Party organization led the workers to strive for excellence with all their might, and to complete the task of supplying orders for the front lines. This year, the factory's textile production has exceeded twice that of 1946 (the first year of the Five-Year Plan).

　　*Izvestia* pointed out: Today, the "Three Mountains" factory is a model socialist enterprise. The factory's employees, especially the Communist Party members, are all focused on and quickly respond to every new plan.

　　*Trud*, the organ of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, emphasized that socialist competition has become the basis of the factory's work. Ninety-eight percent of the factory's employees participated in the competition.

    莫斯科“三山”纺织厂荣获列宁勋章
    苏各报著文纪念该厂百五十周年一致赞扬为模范的社会主义企业
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：一九四九年十二月三十日，是莫斯科“三山”纺织厂的一百五十周年纪念日。苏联最高苏维埃主席团特以列宁勋章授与这个卓越的企业，并以奖品颁给工厂中的许多工人，因为该厂工人已胜利地完成了政府所交付的制造纺织物的任务。
    真理报为纪念这个日子，特撰专文叙述该厂的光荣历史称：这工厂的纺织工人是俄罗斯工人阶级光荣的革命传统的继承人。一九○五年十二月，他们曾在布尔什维克的领导下，在莫斯科红色普列斯尼亚要塞英勇起义。内战期间，许多“三山”工厂的工人参加了红军。在和平建设的岁月中，他们仍然忠于光荣的革命传统而树立了忘我劳动的范例。在第一次五年计划中，“三山”工厂的工人贡献给国家六亿五千五百万公尺的纺织物。在第二个五年计划中所生产的就更多了。在希特勒德国对苏联发动背信弃义的进攻之后几天内，该厂的全部生产即转入了战时生产。党组织领导工人们以全力争取模范，完成供给前线定货的任务。今年该厂的纺织物生产，超过一九四六年（即五年计划第一年）的两倍。
    消息报指出：今天“三山”工厂是模范的社会主义企业。该厂的职工，首先是共产党员，都聚精会神地考虑并迅速响应每一个新的计划。
    全苏工会中央理事会机关报劳动报着重指出，社会主义竞赛已经成为该厂工作的基础。该厂员工百分之九十八参加竞赛了。
