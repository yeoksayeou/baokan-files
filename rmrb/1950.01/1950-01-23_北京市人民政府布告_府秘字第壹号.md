    Provisional Rules for the Management of Transactions of the Beijing Grain Exchange

Article 1. All grain transactions conducted within the Beijing Grain Exchange (hereinafter referred to as the Exchange) shall be governed by these rules, unless otherwise stipulated by central laws and regulations.

Article 2. All public and private factories, shops, firms, and other businesses engaged in the grain sales industry or using grain as raw materials for manufacturing, and holding business licenses from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce (or the former Bureau of Industry and Commerce) or the Bureau of Industry, may apply to the Exchange for regular participation in transactions.

Article 3. Those who meet one of the following conditions and are approved by the Exchange may participate in temporary transactions: ① Merchants holding grain sales business licenses from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce (or the former Bureau of Industry and Commerce). ② Legal grain merchants from other cities or towns who hold certification documents from the local competent authorities or are certified by legal businesses in this city. ③ Cooperatives in this city holding certification from the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and farmers' cooperatives in various regions holding certification from their respective cooperatives.

In addition to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, other persons who need to participate in temporary transactions must be approved by the Bureau of Commerce.

Article 4. Those who are permitted by the Exchange to participate in transactions will be issued a participation certificate by the Exchange, the format of which will be determined separately. The aforementioned participation certificate shall not be lent or transferred. If lost, a declaration must be published in the newspaper for three days to declare it invalid, and then a replacement may be applied for with a guarantor and the newspaper.

Article 5. Participation certificates are divided into regular and temporary types. Regular participation certificates are valid for one year and are renewed upon expiration, with a review every six months. Temporary participation certificates are valid for a period determined as needed.

Article 6. Participants in transactions must wear their participation certificates, otherwise they will not be allowed to enter the Exchange. During transactions, they shall conduct buying and selling according to their business nature. Transportation businesses are only allowed to sell goods, retail businesses are only allowed to buy goods, and manufacturing or processing businesses are only allowed to buy raw materials and sell finished products. However, those who are genuinely engaged in material exchange may make exceptions with the approval of the Bureau of Commerce.

Article 7. Participants in transactions may buy and sell directly or entrust Exchange staff to introduce buyers and sellers. The price shall be openly and freely negotiated by the buying and selling parties without restriction, but upon the completion of the transaction, the staff must be notified, and two copies of the transaction form must be filled out, with the seals of the buying and selling parties and the staff affixed. One copy shall be kept by the Exchange for record, and one copy shall be given to the buyer for safekeeping.

Article 8. After the transaction is completed, the seller shall deposit a sample of the goods with the Exchange and the buyer. The buyer shall present the transaction form and pay for and pick up the goods on the same day. After picking up the goods, the transaction form shall be marked with the word "paid" by the seller and returned to the buyer for safekeeping. If the quality of the goods is found to be inconsistent or other disputes arise during pickup and cannot be resolved independently, the Exchange shall be responsible for mediation, but shall not be liable for compensation for losses.

Article 9. Participants in transactions shall pay a handling fee to the Exchange. The collection method will be determined separately.

Article 10. Participants in transactions shall not engage in illegal activities such as buying and selling short, futures speculation, profiteering, spreading rumors, raising prices, or fraud, and shall maintain public order within the Exchange.

Article 11. The Exchange has the right to send personnel at any time to inspect and inquire about the transaction records of participants.

Article 12. Those who violate the provisions of these rules may be given a warning or have their participation in transactions suspended or revoked by the Exchange. If the circumstances are serious, they will be referred to the competent authorities for handling.

Article 13. Participants in transactions who have one of the following circumstances will lose their qualification to participate and shall return their participation certificate:

1. Business closure. 2. Revocation of participation qualification by the Exchange. 3. Expiration of the participation certificate.

Article 14. Matters not covered in these rules may be amended at any time.

Article 15. These rules shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.
