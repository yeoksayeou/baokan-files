    Organized Political Reports to the Working People
    Ligachev, Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party's Zhdanov City Committee
    Improving the political education of the working people depends on the personal participation of party and government leaders in this work.

    The improvement of the working people's political consciousness and the success of the socialist competition to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule largely depend on the scale and high ideological level of mass political work.

    The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) has repeatedly instructed that the most important condition for improving the ideological level of political propaganda is that leading party and Soviet workers personally participate in mass political work. They should systematically deliver political speeches on important issues of domestic and foreign policy of the Party and the government at mass worker meetings.

    Not only propagandists, but also leaders of party, Soviet, trade union and economic departments preside over mass political work among the working people of Zhdanov City. The secretaries of the party's city committee and district committees, and the chairmen of district executive committees systematically give reports on political topics,

            Publicizing the international situation and important decisions of the Party and the government.

    The party's city committee, taking into account the working people's keen interest in political reports and speeches, has created groups of reporters and speakers from among the activists. They systematically deliver reports and speeches on the international situation, on the people's democratic countries, and on the most important decisions of the Party and the government.

    Some leading activists make reports and speeches on economic topics, including the significance of increasing labor productivity during the transition from socialism to communism. This group of speakers includes Comrade Lomaniko, chief engineer of the "Azovstal" factory, Comrade Kimakov, chief engineer of the "Azovstalstroy" trust, port commander Ivan Chinchenko, and many others. Their speeches promote advanced working methods, improve workers' labor productivity, and better utilize equipment.

            Introducing advanced examples in economic construction to promote production and construction work.

    It happened that after Comrade Kagan, the director of the "Azovstal" factory, reported on the organized competition of Muscovites to better utilize working capital, non-party steelmaking technician Dmitri Mazhalov and Communist Party member workers Panchelei and Plotnik made speeches at the meeting saying that melting steel could be done two to two and a half hours earlier than the set target. The steelmaking technicians' proposal was supported. A competition to shorten the production cycle was launched in the factory. Thus, one of the basic levers for accelerating the turnover of working capital was put into practice. The "Azovstal" steelmaking technicians now produce molten steel in thirteen to fourteen hours instead of seventeen and a half hours.

    The city's factories and industrial sector workers, following the example of Muscovites, have withdrawn 60 million rubles of working capital this year. Of course, the wide publicity of the Moscow experience is beneficial to the cause. The party's city committee and district committees systematically organize speeches by economic and party leaders on this issue. The detailed report on accelerating the turnover of working capital made by Kashyanov, the director of the Kubishev factory, is worthy of attention. In order to accelerate the turnover of funds, he used concrete examples to convincingly tell the workers, technicians, and engineers of the rolling pipe manufacturing workshop what must be done and how it should be done. The result of the competition to better utilize funds has enabled the factory to pay for raw materials ahead of schedule.

    Comrade Kulikov, chairman of the Soviet Executive Committee of Potaovsk District, Comrade Maksim, director of the gas factory, and others have also successfully delivered reports on similar topics.

    The city's enterprises have withdrawn nearly 40 million rubles from working capital and have begun to pay for raw materials ahead of schedule. Undoubtedly, these achievements are due to the efforts of our activists in promoting socialist economic methods.

            Organizing thematic reports to educate young people and children.

    There are tens of thousands of young men and women in the city, including 10,000 members of the Communist Youth League. Many of them work in factories and construction sites. Party organizations hold thematic reports for young workers. Young people are interested in listening to speeches on communist morality and speeches on the tasks of young experts and workers in the struggle to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    Zhdanov is a city of metallurgy, machine manufacturing and fishery. This year, 35,000 people are studying in metallurgical schools and technical schools, normal schools, naval training schools, nursing schools, vocational schools and factory training schools, middle schools and primary schools. Among them are mainly the children of our city's workers and staff, who are eager to educate their children to become cultured, diligent, and upright people. At the same time, they are also interested in the formation of human character and morality. Therefore, reports on children's education issues are systematically given to these parents. Honorary teacher Comrade Deyelomanov is the most outstanding among these reports. His detailed and excellent speeches on "On Family and School" and "On the Communist Education of Children" are very popular among residents.

            Party committees lead speakers, helping them improve their theoretical level and speaking ability.

    The party's city committee and district committees constantly lead speakers, care about their theoretical improvement, and give them methodological and various assistance. Many of them have participated in the activist discussion group attached to the party's city committee for more than a year. At this meeting, there are regular qualified speeches on the theory and history of Bolshevism, socialist economics, and philosophy. Guiding speeches and reports are set up for reporters, consultations are held with them, and reference documents are collected for them in the party's office. For example, recently, reports were made for our city's reporters on the current situation, on the reunification of Ukrainian peasants within the Ukrainian Soviet state, and on the military, political, and economic situation in China.

    The topics of speeches and reports are determined and approved by the party's city committee every month. The original text of the speeches and reports is discussed at the speakers' and reporters' meeting, and it can only be read to the audience if it is passed.

    There are also other methods to supervise the quality of reports and speeches. For example, city committee workers inspect speeches, study the reactions of listeners, party enterprises and the leaders of institutions to the speeches, etc.

    The party's city committee's high requirements for speakers and reporters, its constant concern for their theoretical improvement, and its comprehensive assistance to them—this can achieve significant results. Comrade Baodunov, the secretary of the party's Portov District Committee, did not dare to make political speeches and reports in front of the audience not long ago. Now, he is one of the best reporters on various topics. The workers of many enterprises in the city are very interested in listening to his speech "How the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Was Built" and his report "The Chinese People in the Struggle for National Independence." Comrade Chitalinko, the secretary of the party's Ilyich District Committee, has made seven political reports at worker meetings in the past six months.

    The speaker group among activists is constantly growing. Now there are more than 400 in total, but the city committee still considers it not enough. Because there are still hundreds of economic workers, engineers, teachers, and doctors in the city who have rich knowledge, but have not yet been absorbed to make speeches and reports. The party's city committee is concerned with constantly selecting personnel from among the activists to enrich the members of the reporters, better help them, and at the same time use this to more fully meet the spiritual needs of the working people.

### 有组织地向劳动人民作政治报告

    有组织地向劳动人民作政治报告
    乌克兰共产党日丹诺夫市委会书记  里格切夫
    劳动人民政治教育的提高，依靠党政领导人亲自参加这一工作。
    劳动人民的政治意识的提高，争取先期完成战后五年计划的社会主义竞赛的成功，大多依靠于群众政治工作的规模和高度思想水平。
    联共（布）中央委员会曾屡次指示：提高政治宣传的思想水平的最重要的条件是党和苏维埃的工作者的领导人要亲自参加群众政治工作。他们应有系统地在群众工人大会上以党和政府的内外的政策重要问题作出政治演说。
    不只鼓动者，还有党的、苏维埃的、职工会和经济部门的领导人也主持日丹诺夫城劳动人民中的群众政治工作。党的市委会和区委会书记，区执行委员会主席有系统地作政治题目的报告。
            宣传国际情势，党和政府的重要决议。
    党的市委会考虑到劳动人民对于政治题目的报告和演说的浓厚兴趣，从积极分子中创建报告人的和演说者的团体。他们有计划地作出关于国际情势，关于人民民主国家，关于党和政府的最重要的决议的报告和演说。
    一部分领导的积极分子，作出经济题目的报告和演说，其中包括社会主义到共产主义过渡期间的劳动生产率增加的意义。这个报告者团体包括：“阿佐夫斯特里”工厂的总工程师洛玛尼考同志，“阿佐夫斯塔里斯特尔”托辣斯总工师基玛考夫同志，港口指挥员伊凡秦克和其他许多人。他们的演说促进工作的先进方法，提高工人的劳动生产率，更好的利用设备。
            介绍经济建设中先进范例，推动生产建设工作。
    曾有这样的事情，在“阿佐夫斯特里”工厂的厂长考干同志报告莫斯科人争取更好地利用流动资金的有组织竞赛后，非党的炼钢技师季米特里、玛札洛夫和共产党员工人潘切列依、普洛秦克曾在大会上发表演说说：熔化钢比预定目标可能提早两个钟头到两个半钟头。炼钢技师的提议获得了支持。在工厂里展开了争取缩短生产周期的竞赛。于是，加速流动资金周转的基本杠杆之一实行起来了。“阿佐夫斯塔里”炼钢技师们，现在生产熔化钢以十三小时到十四小时代替了十七小时半了。
    城市的工厂将和工业部门的劳动者，仿效者莫斯科人的例子在今年抽出了六千万卢布流动资金。当然，莫斯科人经验的广泛宣传是有益于事业的。党的市委会与区委会有系统地组织了经济的和党的领导工作者对于这个问题的演说。古北什夫工厂的厂长卡西雅诺夫所作的加速流动资金周转的详细报告，是应该注意的。他为了加速资金的周转，以具体的例子使人信服地告诉压延管制造车间的工人、技师、工程师必须作什么以及应该怎样作。争取更好地利用资金的竞赛结果，使工厂有可能先期支付原料费。
    泡脱夫斯克区苏维埃执行委员会主席枯里考夫同志，煤气工厂的厂长玛克西姆同志和其他的人，也成功地做了相似题目报告。
    城市的企业已从流动资金中抽出近四千万卢布，同时开始先期支付原料费。无可置疑地，在这些成就中，是我们的宣传社会主义经济方式的积极分子的功绩。
            组织专题报告，教育青年儿童。
    在城市里计有数万青年男女，其中包括一万共产主义青年团团员。他们之间许多人是在工厂、建筑厂里作工。党组织为年青工人举行专题的报告。青年人们有兴趣地倾听关于共产主义道德的演说，关于青年专家和工人在争取提前完成五年计划斗争中的任务的演说。
    日丹诺夫是冶金、机器制造厂和渔业城市。今年，有三万五千人在冶金学校和技术学校、师范学校、海军训练学校、护士学校，职业学校和工厂训练学校、中学和小学里学习。其中主要是我们城市的工人和职员的孩子，他们渴望教育自己的孩子成为有文化的，勤勉的，正直的人。同时他们对人类性格和道德的形成问题也感到兴趣。因此，对于这些父母们有系统地作些关于儿童教育问题的报告。荣誉教师得耶洛曼夫同志在这类题目的报告之间是最为出众的。他的《论家庭和学校》，《论孩子的共产主义教育》的精细而出色的演说在居民之中是颇孚众望的。
            党委领导演说者，帮助其提高理论水平和讲演能力。
    党的市委会与区委会经常地领导演说者，关怀他们理论的提高，给予他们方法的和各种不同的帮助。他们之中有许多人已在党的市委会所附设的积极分子讨论会中参加了一年多了，在这个会上，经常有关于布尔塞维克主义的理论和历史问题、社会主义经济学和哲学的有资格的演说。为了报告者设立了指导性的演说和报告，与他们协商，为了他们在党的办公厅里收集了参考的文献。例如，近来，为了我们城市的报告者，曾作了关于目前情况，关于乌克兰农民重新团结于乌克兰苏维埃国家内以及关于中国的军事政治和经济情况的报告。
    演说和报告的题目，每月都由党的市委会确定及批准。演说和报告的原文在演说者和报告者的大会上讨论，如果被通过了的话才能给听众宣读。
    还有一些其他方法来监督报告和演说的质量。例如市委会工作者视察演说，研究听众、党的企业和机关的领导者对演说的反响等。
    党的市委会对于演说者和报告者的高度要求，不断的关怀他们理论的提高，全面地帮助他们——这可得到显著的成果。党的波尔托夫区委会书记包都诺夫同志不久以前还没有决心在听众面前作政治题目的演说和报告。现在，他是各种题目的最好的报告者之一了。城市的许多企业中的劳动者们，都非常有兴趣地倾听他的“苏联共产党（布）是怎样建设起来的”演说和“中国人民在争取民族独立的斗争中”的报告。党的伊里奇区委会书记齐塔林科同志近半年来在工人大会上曾作过七次政治报告。
    积极分子中的演说者团体不断的增长。现在总计已有四百个以上了，但市委会仍认为不够。因为城中还有数百个经济工作者、工程师、教师、医生，他们都具有丰富的素养，但都还没有吸收来作演说和报告。党的市委会关怀不断地从积极分子中选拔人员来充实报告者的成员，更好帮助他们，同时以此来更完全的满足劳动人民的精神需要。
