    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th. TASS Berlin, 4th: The foreign trade of the German Democratic Republic has greatly expanded. During the Leipzig Fair in the spring of 1949, the Council of Public Enterprises signed export agreements with Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Shortly thereafter, the Council signed a similar agreement with Poland worth $500,000. This month, the Council decided to sign a new agreement with Poland, with a total value of $2.5 million. The German Democratic Republic's accurate fulfillment of export agreements and the improvement of the quality of products from public enterprises have earned it great credibility in foreign markets. Countries such as Argentina are placing orders for products from the Republic's public enterprises. The Daily Review reported that in 1950, the Soviet Union will be the largest customer of the German Democratic Republic.
