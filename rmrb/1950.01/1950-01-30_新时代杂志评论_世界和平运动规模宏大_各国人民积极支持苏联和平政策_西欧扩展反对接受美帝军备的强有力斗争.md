Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: TASS reports: The latest issue of the New Era magazine, under the title "Stop the Warmongers!", publishes an article pointing out: The first few weeks of January have shown a new mass movement of peace advocates on a vast scale in various countries around the world. The advocacy of peace has become increasingly concrete, purposeful, and is being carried out in an increasingly effective manner.

It is not enough to simply not want war. We must fight for peace with effective methods, persistence, and unwavering determination.

The New Era continues: The struggle for peace is led by the great Soviet Union. The Soviet Union pursues a consistent, unwavering, Stalinist policy of peaceful friendship between all nations. This policy is in line with the fundamental and vital interests of all the peoples of the Soviet Union, and also in line with the highest interests of all mankind. The masses of people in all continents and countries are increasingly realizing the importance of actively supporting the Soviet Union's peace policy in order to avoid another world slaughter.

The warmongers are carrying out their despicable and dirty anti-peace conspiracies, engaging in sabotage activities cunningly on a very broad front. The arms race in the capitalist countries of the world manipulated by the United States, the enormous military expenditures, the militarization of Marshallized countries, turning some countries into strategic bases for new ambitious aspirants to world hegemony, the oaths and slanderous propaganda against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, against communism, emanating from the newspapers and radio stations of the monopoly capitalists, the series of imperialist colonial wars in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaya - all of this is an organically organized part of the entire plan dominated by the instigators of another world war. And the peace advocates are precisely carrying out the struggle against the forces of imperialism on this broad front.

    世界和平运动规模宏大
    各国人民积极支持苏联和平政策
    西欧扩展反对接受美帝军备的强有力斗争
    【新华社北京二十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：最近一期新时代杂志以《制止战争贩子！》为题，撰文指出：一月份的头几周，就可以看到世界各国和平拥护者规模宏大的新的群众运动。拥护和平已越来越具体，越来越有目的性，并且以越来越有效的方式进行。
    仅仅不要战争是不够的。必须用有效的方法、坚持不懈和不屈不挠地进行争取和平的斗争。
    新时代继称：争取和平的斗争是由伟大的苏联领导的。苏联奉行着始终如一的、坚定不移的、各民族和平友好的斯大林政策。这一政策符合苏联各族人民基本的切身利益，也符合全体人类的最高利益。各洲、各国的人民群众，越来越了解到积极支持苏联和平政策以便避免另一次世界屠杀的重要性。
    战争贩子正在进行他们卑鄙肮脏的反和平阴谋，在极广泛的阵线上狡狯地进行破坏活动。由美国操纵的资本主义世界各国的军备竞赛，庞大的军费，使马歇尔化国家军国主义化，把若干国家变成称霸世界的新野心家的战略基地，从垄断资本家的报纸与电台上发出来的、反对苏联和人民民主国家、反对共产主义的诺言与诽谤宣传，在印尼、越南、马来亚的一连串帝国主义殖民战争——这一切都是另一次世界大战的煽动者支配的、整个计划的有机组织部分。而和平拥护者却正是在这条宽广的阵线上进行反对帝国主义势力的斗争。
