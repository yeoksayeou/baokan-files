    Heighten Vigilance, Strengthen the Defense of the Party
    American Communist Party Expels Enemy Agent Lautner
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 21st: According to a report from Diantong News Agency, New York, January 20th: The New York Worker's Daily reported that the National Review Committee of the American Communist Party is conducting an investigation to determine the extent to which FBI personnel infiltrated the party ranks during the "trial" of eleven American Communist leaders.
    During the inspection process, the Review Committee found that Lautner, a member of the New York State Review Committee, had helped prevent the expulsion of the proven spy Carolomis from the party a few months earlier. During the "trial," he also introduced a group of unreliable people to work in the security bureau. Further investigation revealed that Lautner himself was an old enemy agent, and the full details of the case will be announced in due course. The National Review Committee therefore approved the recommendation of the subcommittee examining the Lautner case, expelling him from the party as a traitor and an enemy of the working class. The Review Committee called on the party's leadership and members to heighten their communist vigilance and redouble their efforts to defend and strengthen the party.

    提高警觉性加强保卫党
    美共开除敌探劳特纳
    【新华社北京二十一日电】据电通社纽约二十日讯：纽约工人日报报道：美国共产党全国审查委员会正在进行调查，以确定在“审讯”十一位美共领袖时暴露出来的联邦调查局人员混入党的队伍中进行活动的情形。
    在检查的过程中，审查委员会查出，几个月以前，纽约州审查委员会委员劳特纳，曾帮助阻止把已经证明了的间谍卡洛米立斯开除出党。在“审讯”期间，他还介绍了一批不可靠的人到保卫局工作。进一步调查显示：劳特纳本人是一个老敌探，全部事件将在适当时候宣布。全国审查委员会因而批准了检查劳特纳案件的小组委员会的建议，把他当作一个叛徒和工人阶级的敌人开除出党。审查委员会要求党的领导机构和党员提高他们共产党人的警觉性，加倍努力地保卫与增强党。
