    The Chinese People's Diplomatic Victory

    More than two months after the founding of the People's Republic of China, and following the establishment of friendly diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries and our country, Burma, India, the United Kingdom, Ceylon, and Norway have recently expressed their willingness to establish diplomatic relations with our country. There is no doubt that this is a diplomatic victory for the Chinese people, and a sign that the international status of the People's Republic of China is becoming increasingly consolidated. This means that the governments of these countries have had to recognize that the masters of China are the Chinese people who have achieved a great victory. The ruthless objective reality has forced the governments of countries such as the United Kingdom to recognize the victory of the Chinese people, and will also force the governments of other imperialist countries to recognize this victory.

            Truman's Aggressive Message

    After the resumption of the 81st U.S. Congress at the beginning of the year, U.S. President Truman, as usual, delivered three messages to Congress: a "State of the Union Message," an "Economic Message," and a "Budget Message." Truman's messages have two characteristics: first, to gloss over reality and paint a rosy picture; second, to continue preparations for war.

    In the "State of the Union Message," Truman described the life of the American people as "heaven on earth"; in the "Economic Message," Truman made an optimistic assessment of the American economic situation. However, the actual situation in the United States is the best irony to Truman's propaganda. In the United States, signs of an economic crisis are becoming more and more evident. Since the autumn of 1948, production in the United States has been declining. From October 1948 to July 1949, among the important industrial production in the United States, steel production decreased by 28 percent, machinery decreased by 21 percent, non-ferrous metals decreased by 32 percent, and textiles decreased by 27 percent. Overall, from October 1948 to October 1949, the industrial production in the United States had decreased by 22 percent. In the first year of the largest economic crisis in the world from 1929 to 1933, the decline in industrial production in the United States was only 15 percent. That is to say, in the year beginning in October 1948, the rate of decline in industrial production has exceeded that of the first year of the last crisis. This change in the American economic situation has produced adverse effects in all aspects of American economic and social life. The most significant is the existence of an ever-expanding army of unemployed. At present, the number of fully unemployed and partially unemployed people in the United States is 14 million.

    In order to find a way out of the crisis, the Truman government's basic policy is still to continue preparing for war. In his "State of the Union Message," Truman called for the implementation of the so-called "North Atlantic Area Defense Plan," the continued implementation of the so-called "Aid to Europe Plan," and the extension of the government's power to draft soldiers in peacetime. In Truman's "Budget Message," he proposed that expenditures for direct and indirect military expenses account for 71 percent of the total budget proposal of 42.439 billion U.S. dollars.

    The so-called "North Atlantic Area Defense Plan," planned by U.S. imperialism, has been approved by the "North Atlantic Treaty Council" controlled by U.S. imperialism. This secret so-called "defense" plan is based on aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. Its principle is: "Offense is the best defense." In this so-called "defense" plan, it is stipulated that France will build 30 divisions and serve as a "shock force" in a new world war.

            Militarization of the Economies of Marshall Plan Countries

    In the Marshall Plan countries controlled by the United States, their economic situation is worse than that of the United States. When their economies had not yet limped to the level of the 1938 crisis year, they continued to decline in 1949. Now, in these countries, there is a general lack of production, rising prices, currency devaluation, trade deficits, a severe shortage of U.S. dollars, declining wages, high unemployment, and increasing impoverishment of the masses.

    The bourgeoisie of the Marshall Plan countries, for a few U.S. dollars, do not hesitate to sell their national sovereignty to Wall Street, and the little money they get is not even enough to plug most of the loopholes. The United Kingdom is the most typical example. The United Kingdom is the country that has received the most "aid" from the Marshall Plan funds, but it is also the country with the highest U.S. dollar deficit.

    However, the Marshall Plan countries must repay the "aid" of U.S. imperialism, and they must pay a high price. One of the prices is to adapt the economies of these countries to the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism. One of the main functions of the Marshall Plan is to promote the rapid militarization of the Western European economy, thereby serving the U.S. imperialist policy of launching a new war. Under the impetus of this policy, in 1949, the direct military expenditures of the Western European countries alone accounted for the largest part of the national budget. According to materials from the British "Statistician" weekly, the proportion of direct military expenditures in the national budgets of important Western European countries is as follows: United Kingdom 23 percent, France 18.7 percent, Italy 23.6 percent, the Netherlands 30 percent, and Turkey 24.6 percent. If the indirect military expenditures of these countries are also included, the figure must be at least doubled. The Marshall Plan countries have spent huge sums on the arms race. In 1949, in just a few major countries in Western Europe, their expenditures on the arms race exceeded 6 billion U.S. dollars, while the "aid" obtained by all Marshall Plan countries from the United States only amounted to about 4 billion U.S. dollars per year.

    Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, the ruling classes of Western European countries are leading their countries politically, economically, and militarily to disaster. For this reason, they are facing increasing resistance from their own people.

            New Forms of Anti-War Struggle

    In recent times, the mass struggle against war and in defense of peace in Western European countries has undergone new developments and adopted new forms of struggle. In France and Italy, where mass forces are strong, a movement of laboring people refusing to produce or transport war materials is underway. Workers in many French factories have announced a halt to the manufacture of weapons, and many French dockworkers and railway workers have launched a movement to refuse to load and unload or prevent the transport of American war materials. Dockworkers at the port of Ancona in Italy have also responded to this movement, stating: "In our port, all munitions brought from the United States and other countries for use in a new war of aggression will not be unloaded." This developing new movement marks the deepening and expansion of the mass anti-war struggle in Western European countries.

    The movement to defend peace is also expanding in every corner of the world, and its momentum is becoming increasingly large. Since the World Peace Congress was held in April 1949, the world movement to defend peace has achieved great success. National peace conferences have been held in 26 countries, and national peace committees have been established in 46 countries; on October 2, 1949 – International Peace Struggle Day – tens of millions of people in 60 countries held grand demonstrations; the leading body of the world movement to defend peace – the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress – maintains regular contact with the movements to defend peace in 76 countries (almost all countries on earth). It can be predicted that this year, the world-scale movement to defend peace will have greater development and will achieve more successes.

### 中国人民在外交上的胜利

专栏：国际一游

    中国人民在外交上的胜利
    在中华人民共和国诞生的两个多月之后，在苏联及各人民民主国家和我国建立友好的外交关系之后，缅甸、印度、英国、锡兰和挪威也于最近先后表示愿与我国建立外交关系了。毫无疑义，这是中国人民在外交上的胜利，这是中华人民共和国国际地位日趋巩固的标志。这意味着这些国家的政府已经不得不承认中国的主人是取得了伟大胜利的中国人民。无情的客观现实已经迫使了英国等国政府不得不承认中国人民的胜利，而且也将迫使其他帝国主义国家政府不得不承认这一胜利。
            杜鲁门的侵略性咨文
    美国第八十一届国会在年初复会之后，美总统杜鲁门照例向国会宣读了三个咨文：一个是“国情咨文”，一个是“经济咨文”，一个是“预算咨文”。杜鲁门的咨文有两个特点：第一是粉饰太平，第二是继续备战。
    在“国情咨文”中，杜鲁门把美国人民的生活形容为“人间天堂”；在“经济咨文”中，杜鲁门对美国的经济情况作了乐观的估价。但是，美国的实情对杜鲁门的宣传却是最好的讽刺。在美国，经济危机爆发的征候正愈来愈多。自一九四八年秋季以来，美国的生产即在节约下降。自一九四八年十月至一九四九年七月，在美国重要的工业生产中，钢铁生产量下降了百分之二十八，机器下降了百分之二十一，有色金属下降了百分之三十二，纺织品下降了百分之二十七。总起来说，自一九四八年十月至一九四九年十月，美国的工业生产量已下降了百分之二十二。而在一九二九—一九三三年世界上最大的一次经济危机的第一年，美国工业生产量的下降只是百分之十五。这就是说，一九四八年十月开始的这一年，工业生产量下降的速度，已经超过了上次危机的第一年。美国经济情势的这种变化，在美国经济和社会生活的各方面都产生了恶果。最显著的是一支日益扩大的失业大军的存在。目前，美国完全失业与部分失业者的数目，已有一千四百万人。
    为了从危机中寻找出路，杜鲁门政府的基本政策还是继续准备战争。杜鲁门在他的“国情咨文”中，要求实现所谓“北大西洋区域防御计划”，继续实行所谓“援欧计划”，以及延长政府在和平时期的征兵权力等。在杜鲁门的“预算咨文”中，他提出的作为直接与间接军事费用的支出，竟占预算草案总支出四百二十四亿三千九百万美元中的百分之七十一。
    由美帝国主义策划的所谓“北大西洋区域防御计划”，已为美帝国主义控制的“北大西洋公约理事会”所批准。这个秘密的所谓“防御”计划，是以向苏联与人民民主国家实行侵略为基础的。它的原则就是：“进攻是最好的防御”。在这个所谓“防御”计划中，规定法国建军三十个师，并在新的世界大战中担任“突击队”的任务。
            马歇尔化国家经济的军事化
    在美国控制下的马歇尔化各国，它们的经济情势比美国更坏，当它们的经济一跛一跌地还没有爬上一九三八年危机年度的水平时，在一九四九年就已一直往下滚了。现在，在这些国家中，普遍地是生产不足，物价上涨，通货贬值，贸易入超，美元奇缺，工资下降，失业众多，以及群众生活的日益贫穷化。
    马歇尔化各国的资产阶级，为了几块美元，不惜把它们国家的主权出卖给华尔街，而所得到的一点钱，却甚至不足以堵塞大部的漏洞。英国的例子最为典型，英国是从马歇尔计划拨款中得到“援助”最多的国家，但却也是美元赤字最高的国家。
    虽然如此，马歇尔化国家却必须报答美帝的“援助”，它们必须付出很高的代价。代价之一是将这些国家的经济适合于美帝的侵略政策。马歇尔计划的主要作用之一，就是促使西欧经济迅速地军事化，从而为美帝发动新战争的政策服务。在这种政策的推动之下，在一九四九年，单只西欧各国的直接军费，便占去了国家预算的最大部分。根据英国“统计学家”周刊的材料，西欧重要国家直接军费在国家预算中的比例如下：英国百分之二十三，法国百分之十八点七，意大利百分之二十三点六，荷兰百分之三十，土耳其百分之二十四点六。如果将这些国家的间接军费也计算在内，则其数字至少须增加一倍。马歇尔化各国为军备竞赛支出了巨大的费用。一九四九年，只是在西欧的几个主要国家，其用于军备竞赛的开支即已在六十亿美元以上，而所有马歇尔化国家从美国取得的“援助”，每年只约达四十亿美元。
    在美帝国主义的指使之下，西欧诸国的统治阶级正在政治上、经济上、军事上把它们的国家引向灾乱，由于这种原因，它们正遭逢着本国人民日益增加的反抗。
            反战斗争的新形式
    最近时期以来，西欧各国反对战争保卫和平的群众斗争，有了新的发展，并采取了新的斗争形式。在群众力量雄厚的法国和意大利，劳动人民拒绝生产或运输作战物资的运动正在开展中。不少的法国工厂的工人，已经宣布停止制造武器，很多的法国码头工人与铁路工人，已经掀起拒绝起卸或阻止运输美国战争物资的运动。意大利安科纳港的码头工人也已响应这一运动，他们表示：“在我们的港口里，所有自美国和其他国家运来准备为新的侵略战争使用的军火，将一概不予起卸。”这一正在发展中的新的运动，标志着西欧国家群众反战斗争的深入与扩大。
    保卫和平的运动，也在全世界的各个角落扩展着，它的声势已经越来越浩大。自从一九四九年四月举行世界拥护和平大会以来，世界保卫和平的运动已经获得巨大的成就，已经有二十六个国家举行了全国和平大会，有四十六个国家成立了全国和平委员会；在一九四九年十月二日——国际和平斗争日，有六十个国家几千万的群众举行了盛大的示威；世界保卫和平运动的领导机关——世界拥护和平大会常设委员会，正和七十六个国家（几乎是地球上所有的国家）保卫和平的运动保持着经常的联系。可以预断：今年，全世界规模的保卫和平运动将会有更大的发展，将会获得更多的成就。
