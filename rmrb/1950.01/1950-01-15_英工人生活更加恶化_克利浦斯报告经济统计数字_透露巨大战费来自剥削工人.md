Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: TASS, Moscow, 12th: British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps released a review on "The Economic Results of Britain's Efforts in 1949" at a press conference in London on the 9th. Despite his cautious wording, Cripps' own statistics still revealed a picture vastly different from what he boasted during the election campaign.

Cripps' statistics actually proved that the living standards of British workers worsened further last year. According to the materials cited by Cripps, British labor productivity increased by 5% last year, and national income rose by about 4%. Cripps claimed that total personal expenditure rose by 3%, and claimed that this was only partly due to rising prices. But in another part of his statement, he admitted that retail prices rose by 3%, while the wage rate index only increased by a small point. Comparing these two official indexes, it can be seen that real wages decreased by more than 2%.

Cripps admitted that about 10% of industrial companies increased their dividends last year, and also admitted that the increased exploitation of workers was used to pay for the huge expenses of war preparations carried out to fulfill obligations under the Western European Union.

Cripps' statistics proved that Britain's dollar deficit is still huge. In 1949, only one-tenth of Britain's exports went to the dollar area. He estimated that Britain's deficit in visible trade last year was £429 million, compared with £432 million in 1948.

The British Manchester Guardian expressed concern about Cripps' statement, saying: "Cripps underestimates the ongoing dollar crisis. In 1946, the dollar deficit was 900 million US dollars. In 1948, the deficit reached 1.7 billion US dollars, and last year it was 1.5 billion US dollars. There is nothing to be proud of in this change."

    英工人生活更加恶化
    克利浦斯报告经济统计数字
    透露巨大战费来自剥削工人
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：英国财政大臣克利浦斯九日在伦敦记者招待会上发表“一九四九年英国努力的经济结果”的回顾。尽管他的措词小心翼翼，但克利浦斯自己的统计，仍然透露了与他在进行竞选所吹嘘的大为不同的图景。
    克利浦斯的统计实际上证明去年英国工人的生活标准更加恶化。根据克利浦斯所举材料，英国劳动生产率去年增加了百分之五，国民收入上升百分之四左右。克利浦斯称全部个人开支上升了百分之三，并称这只有部分是由于物价上涨。但他在声明的另一部分，承认零售物价上涨百分之三，同时工资率指数却只微小地增加了一个点。把这两个官方指数比较一下，便可看出实际工资是减少了百分之二以上。
    克利浦斯承认约有百分之十的工业公司增加了去年的红利，同时也承认对工人剥削的增加，是用来支付为履行西欧联盟下所负义务而进行的战争准备的巨大经费。
    克利浦斯的统计证明，英国的美元赤字仍然是巨大的。一九四九年，英国的出口，只有十分之一输往美元区。他估计去年英国有形贸易的逆差为四亿二千九百万镑，一九四八年则为四亿三千二百万镑。
    英国曼彻斯特卫报对克利浦斯的声明表示忧虑称：“克利浦斯低估了继续中的美元危机。一九四六年美元赤字是九亿美元。一九四八年赤字到了十七亿美元，去年是十五亿美元。这样改变毫无值得骄傲之处”。
