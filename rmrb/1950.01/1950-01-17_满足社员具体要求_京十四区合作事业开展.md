    Meeting Specific Needs of Members
    Cooperation Development in Beijing's Fourteenth District
    [This newspaper reported] The Fourteenth District Cooperative Branch of Beijing Suburbs, established in March of last year, has established village cooperatives based on the needs and specific conditions of the local people, and its business has developed. Shiliuzhuang in the district has a foundation in weaving, so the branch organized the masses to establish a weaving cooperative. Majiabao produces wild tea, and tea was also produced during the Japanese puppet era, so a tea-making cooperative was established to organize a large number of members to pick wild tea. Because it was established on the above foundation and truly solved the life difficulties of many members, from March to December, twenty various cooperatives were established in twenty-one villages (thirteen supply and marketing cooperatives, four consumer cooperatives, one medical cooperative, one briquette cooperative, and four for weaving, etc.). There were a total of 13,524 members, accounting for more than 70% of the total number of households in the twenty-one villages.
    Since its establishment, the district branch has determined that its business policy is mainly to promote the products of its members, and to supply members with food, coal, and daily necessities. From March to December, it purchased a total of 616,129 jin of cotton, 55,900 jin of seed cotton, 132,775 jin of corn, and 283,289 jin of rice from its members, with general prices about 2% higher than market prices. In addition, it purchased more than 600,000 jin of saltpeter, and 143,522 jin of miscellaneous grains from non-members. It helped Majiabao promote tea sales and introduced it to other cooperatives for resale. In terms of supply, from March to December, it supplied a total of 46,414 jin of edible salt, 11,447 packs of matches, 4,129 jin of kerosene, 50,382 chi of cloth, 165,104 jin of vermicelli, 171,037 jin of corn flour, and 61,269 jin of miscellaneous grains (supply figures do not include the three supply and marketing cooperatives of Majiabao, Xiaocun, and Shiliuzhuang). In order to supply members with corn flour, the district branch installed a 15-horsepower electric mill, grinding about 2,300 jin of flour every day; in September, it established a coal briquette cooperative, and by the end of December, it had supplied members with more than 650 tons of coal briquettes; the district branch also sent special personnel to Tianjin and Qinhuangdao to solve the sales problem of saltpeter for the members, and the third contract has now been signed. This has won the support and trust of the majority of members. The masses in Longhe Village asked the district cooperative for cloth for single clothes in summer, fertilizer in spring, and after harvesting rice in autumn, they sent the surplus to the district cooperative for sale. According to a survey by the Nanyuan Town Village Cooperative, the grain supplied by the district branch to its members accounted for 64% of the members' total grain consumption, and 49% of the daily necessities of the Jiugong Village members were obtained from the district branch.
    Cooperatives have played a significant role in organizing the sideline production of the majority of members and in supporting agricultural production. The masses in Majiabao organized a tea-making cooperative with a total of 485 shares. The Beijing Cooperative Headquarters also provided loans to support it. The entire year, the cooperative made more than 70,000 jin of tea (green tea), which solved the livelihood problems of most farmers. Xi Wu Hao suffered from flooding this year. In order to mobilize the majority of farmers to produce and help themselves, a farmers' flour mill was organized. Farmers subscribed 1,263 shares (four jin of mung beans per share). From the end of September to mid-December, 5,640 jin of Longkou vermicelli were produced, averaging more than 73 jin of vermicelli per day, earning a total of 3,526 jin of mung beans, and raising a sow and six piglets. In terms of saltpeter boiling, there are currently 102 saltpeter pots in the district, each pot producing an average of about 350 jin of saltpeter per day, which has mobilized 954 households and more than 1,300 laborers. From the beginning to now, at an average price of two dou and seven sheng of corn per hundred jin, the farmers have obtained more than 281,600 jin of corn, solving the livelihood problems of more than 9,300 people. In terms of supporting agricultural production, the district branch helped the district government realize the plan to open the Nantongshun Canal, enabling the village to get rid of the disaster of waterlogging that plagued crops every year. In order to turn alkaline land into irrigated land, the district branch assisted the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society in lending out 315 waterwheels. In addition, it played a significant role in helping farmers solve the problems of fertilizer and seeds in a timely manner.
    At the beginning of 1950, the district cooperative formulated an annual plan: 1. To establish mass supply and marketing organizations universally. Establish supply and marketing cooperatives in seven villages including Xiaohongmen, strengthen and expand the original supply and marketing cooperatives, develop members, expand shares, and strive to reach 27,500 members this year, accounting for 40% of the total population of the district. Strive to ensure that the supply of necessities to members accounts for more than 50% of the total amount used. Starting from January, pilot supply and marketing groups will be set up in Nantongshun to learn from experience, and supply and marketing groups will be established universally in February, so that the majority of farmers can voluntarily participate in the supply and marketing organizations. The district branch will set up a retail department and pay attention to purchasing the surplus items of farmers and supplying the items most needed by farmers. 2. Organize handicraft cooperatives such as weaving mats and socks in Nanyuan Town. Organize women in nine villages including Laojuntang to make shoe soles, and organize the masses to engage in handicraft production and sideline production. 3. Continue to organize the masses to boil saltpeter in cooperation. 4. Organize seven cooperative brick kilns. 5. Cooperate with the government and the People's Bank to hold spring loans and various production loans, cooperatives will sell fertilizers, sell more agricultural production tools, and meet the needs of liberated farmers.

    满足社员具体要求
    京十四区合作事业开展
    【本报讯】去年三月成立的北京市郊十四区合作分社，根据当地群众的需要和具体条件建立村合作社，业务获得开展。该区石榴庄有织布基础，分社便组织群众成立了织布合作社。马家堡产野茶，在日伪时代也曾制过茶，便成立了制茶社，组织广大社员采野茶。因为是在上述基础上建立的，且真正解决了很多社员的生活困难，所以从三月份至十二月份，在二十一个村中建立了各种合作社二十个（供销社十三个，消费社四个，医药社一个，煤球社一个，织布等四个）。共有社员一万三千五百二十四人，占二十一个村的总户数百分之七十以上。
    区分社自建立之日起，就确定经营方针主要是推销社员的生产品；供给社员食粮、煤炭及日用品。从三月份到十二月份，共收购社员皮棉六十一万六千一百二十九斤，籽棉五万五千九百斤，玉米十三万二千七百七十五斤，大米二十八万三千二百八十九斤，一般价格高于市价百分之二左右。此外并收购硝六十多万斤，及非社员杂粮十四万三千五百二十二斤。帮助马家堡推销茶叶，介绍到其他合作社代销。在供给上，从三月份到十二月份共供给食盐四万六千四百一十四斤，火柴一万一千四百四十七包，煤油四千一百二十九斤，布匹五万零三百八十二尺，通粉十六万五千一百零四斤，玉米面十七万一千零三十七斤，杂粮六万一千二百六十九斤（供给数字不包括马家堡、萧村、石榴庄三供销社）。为了供给社员玉米面，区分社安装了十五匹马力的电磨，每天磨面二千三百斤左右；九月份又设立煤球合作社，至十二月底共供给社员煤球六百五十多吨；区分社并派专人到天津、秦皇岛替社员解决了熬硝的销路问题，现已订立第三次合同。这样获得了广大社员的拥护和信任。龙河村群众在夏天换单衣就向区社要布，春天就向区社要肥料，秋后收了大米，把多余的送到区合作社卖。据南苑镇村社的调查，区分社供给社员的粮食占社员全部用粮的百分之六十四，旧宫村社员日用品中的百分之四十九是由区分社取得的。
    合作社在组织广大社员副业生产，及扶助农业生产方面起了很大作用。马家堡群众组织了制茶合作社，共入股四百八十五股，北京合作总社又贷款扶助，全年共制茶七万余斤（青茶），使大部农民解决了生活问题。西五号今年遭水灾，为了发动广大农民生产自救，组织了农民粉房，农民入股一千二百六十三股（每股绿豆四斤），从九月底到十二月中旬，制出龙口粉五千六百四十斤，平均每天产粉七十三斤多，共赚绿豆三千五百二十六斤，并养了一个母猪，六个小猪。在熬硝方面，全区现有一百零二口硝锅，每口锅每日平均出硝三百五十斤左右，使九百五十四户一千三百多劳力动了起来。从开始到现在，平均每百斤价二斗七升玉米，农民共获玉米二十八万一千六百余斤，解决了九千三百多人的生活。在扶助农业生产方面，区分社帮助区政府实现了南通顺开渠的计划，使该村摆脱了年年庄稼遭涝的厄运。为了使碱地变成水浇田，由区分社协助华北水利推进社共贷出水车三百一十五架。此外在帮助农民及时解决肥料、种籽各方面都起了很大作用。
    兹值一九五○年开始，该区社又订出全年计划：一、普遍建立群众的供销组织。在小红门等七个村建立供销社，并增强扩大原有供销社，发展社员，扩大股金，争取今年社员达到二万七千五百名，占全区总人口百分之四十。争取作到供给社员必需品占使用总额百分之五十以上。从一月份在南通顺试办供销小组，吸取经验，二月份普遍建立供销小组，使广大农民都能够自愿的参加到供销组织里来。区分社设立零售部，并注意收购农民的多余物品，供给农民最需要的物品。二、组织南苑镇织席织袜等手工业合作社。组织老君堂等九村的妇女纳鞋底，组织广大群众投入手工业生产及副业生产。三、继续组织群众熬硝合作社。四、组织合作烧砖窑七个。五、配合政府及人民银行举办春贷及各种生产贷款，合作社贷售肥料，多售农业生产工具，满足翻身农民之使用。
