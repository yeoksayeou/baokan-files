Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao – Mass education work in Qingdao has made considerable progress in the half-year since liberation. Regarding worker education, in addition to the major factories being led by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Education Bureau instructed all middle and primary schools in late November to universally establish night schools for workers and the general public. According to statistics at the end of December, educational centers, middle schools, primary schools, etc., ran a total of 163 mass night classes, with approximately 7,400 students. Trade unions ran a total of 78 worker night schools, with over 15,000 students. Worker and mass night schools focus on cultural learning, and political and ideological education is infused into the teaching of cultural courses. Workers show great enthusiasm for learning. For example, China Textile Factory No. 9 organized literacy classes in workshops, and each workshop had a literacy board. Literacy workers taught before work, and workers often practiced writing on the floor during breaks.

There are currently seven municipal education centers and reading rooms in Qingdao. In the past half-year, the number of people visiting these facilities exceeded 200,000. The two education centers held four photo exhibitions on the liberation of Qingdao, Soviet construction, etc., which were visited by 100,000 people. The eight cinemas in the city screened 39 Soviet films and eight films on the Liberation War in the past half-year, with an audience of approximately 600,000. Qingdao's unique industrial museum and aquarium also overcame difficulties and produced some specimens and educational materials for public viewing and academic research. The Municipal Education Bureau has now formulated a mass education plan for 1950, which will continue to develop on the existing foundation.

    青岛普遍建立夜校组织工人市民学习
    【新华社青岛电】青岛解放半年来的群众教育工作，获得相当进展。在工人教育方面，除各大工厂由市工会领导进行外，市教育局十一月下旬曾指示各中学、小学普遍建立工人和一般群众的夜校。据十二月底统计，由教育馆、中学、小学等办理的群众夜校共有一百六十三班，入校学习群众约七千四百多人。由各工会办理的工人夜校共有七十八处，学生一万五千多人。工人、群众夜校以学习文化为主，在教学文化课程中贯注政治思想教育。工人学习热情很高，如中纺九厂组织了车间识字班，每个车间都挂有识字牌，上工前由识字工人教授，工人们在歇点时常在地板上练习写字。
    青岛市内现有市立教育馆及书报阅览室共七处，半年来到各馆室阅览的人数在二十万人以上。两教育馆举行青岛解放、苏联建设等图片展览会四次，有十万人参观。市内八个电影院半年来共放映苏联影片三十九部，解放战争影片八部，观众约六十万人。青岛特有的产业馆和水族馆，也克服困难，自制了一些标本和教育材料，供群众参观和学术界研究。现在市教育局已经拟定一九五○年的群众教育计划，将在现有基础上续求发展。
