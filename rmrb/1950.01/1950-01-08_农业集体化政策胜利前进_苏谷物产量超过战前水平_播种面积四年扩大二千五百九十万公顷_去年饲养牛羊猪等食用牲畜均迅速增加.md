Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: TASS, Moscow, reported: The newspaper Izvestia published a lengthy article at the end of last year regarding the achievements of Soviet grain production. The article pointed out: The grain problem is one of the most important tasks that the Soviet state must solve. The victory of the agricultural collectivization policy has created the necessary conditions for the rapid advancement of all sectors of agriculture. Under the conditions of collective farming and large-scale mechanization of farmland work in the Soviet Union, it has not only made it possible to expand the sown area, but also to utilize advanced cultivation methods on an unprecedented scale. During the first four years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the sown area in the country expanded by 25.9 million hectares. In terms of output, the grain harvest in 1949 exceeded that of 1945 by 51 percent. In 1949, the grain harvest had already exceeded pre-war levels. Collective farms and state farms delivered 128 million poods (one pood equals 32.76 market catties) more grain to the state than in 1948.

Now, most collective farms in the Soviet Union have implemented a grass-crop rotation system. In 1949, the area of autumn-ploughed land for the following year's spring sowing increased by 65 percent. The area of early fallow land has also expanded by 32 percent. Vast tracts of land have been sown with carefully selected seeds.

The attainment of these achievements is due to the Party and the government's constant and substantial assistance to socialist agriculture with tractors, agricultural machinery, and mineral fertilizers, and also relies on the working people's new conscious attitude towards socialist labor. The examples of agriculturalists obtaining high yields have inspired all farmers to strive to overcome difficulties and learn and apply the achievements of advanced agricultural science. Tens of thousands of people are following in the footsteps of the best men and women in Soviet agriculture.

After the task of increasing grain production has been achieved, the task of livestock breeding has taken a prominent position. The working people of collective farms and state farms are victoriously implementing the three-year plan of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the development of livestock. In 1949, collective farms and state farms increased the number of cattle and dairy cows by 20 percent, sheep by 13 percent, and pigs by 72 percent.

There is no doubt that Soviet farming and livestock breeding will advance at an ever-increasing pace towards the path of agricultural prosperity in our country, and agricultural prosperity is one of the necessary conditions for the transition from socialism to communism.

    农业集体化政策胜利前进
    苏谷物产量超过战前水平
    播种面积四年扩大二千五百九十万公顷
    去年饲养牛羊猪等食用牲畜均迅速增加
    【新华社北京七日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报在去年年底发表关于苏联谷物生产成就的长文。该文指出：谷物问题是苏维埃国家必须予以解决的最重要任务之一。农业集体化政策的胜利，为农业各部门迅速前进创造了必要的条件。在苏联集体耕作和农田工作大规模机械化的条件下，不仅使扩大播种面积成为可能，而且也使空前规模的利用先进的耕作方法成为可能。在战后五年计划的头四年期间，国内的播种面积扩大了二千五百九十万公顷。就产量而言，在一九四九年，谷物收获量超出一九四五年的百分之五十一。一九四九年，谷物收获量已超过战前水平。各集体农场和国营农场，比一九四八年多缴给国家一亿二千八百万普特（一普特合三十二点七六市斤）的谷物。
    现在，苏联的大部分集体农场，都实施了牧草与作物轮种制。一九四九年，为次年春播而进行的秋耕地面积，已增加了百分之六十五。早休耕地的面积，也扩大了百分之三十二。广大的土地播种了精选的种子。
    这些成就的获得，是由于党和政府经常大量地以拖拉机、农业机器及矿物肥料帮助社会主义的农业的结果，并且也依靠了劳动人民对社会主义劳动新的自觉的态度。农业家在获得高额产量方面的范例，鼓舞了所有农民去努力克服困难，学习和应用先进的农业科学的成就。成千成万的人民正追随着苏维埃农业中最优秀男女的步伐前进。
    谷物增产任务达成之后，牲畜饲养的任务便居于显要的地位了。集体农场和国营农场的劳动人民，正胜利地实现苏联部长会议和联共中央关于发展牲畜的三年计划。在一九四九年中，集体农场和国营农场增加食用牛和乳牛百分之二十，羊百分之十三，猪百分之七十二。
    毫无疑问，苏联的农作和牲畜饲养，将以日益增加的快速向着我国的农产富裕的道路前进，而农产富裕，正是从社会主义过渡到共产主义的必要条件之一。
