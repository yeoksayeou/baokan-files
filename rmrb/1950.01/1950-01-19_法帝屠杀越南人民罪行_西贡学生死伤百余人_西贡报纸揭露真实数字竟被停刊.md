    French Imperialists' Crimes of Slaughtering the Vietnamese People
    Over a Hundred Students Killed and Wounded in Saigon
    Saigon Newspapers Revealing True Figures Were Shut Down
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th] According to Vietnam News Agency reports: Four Vietnamese newspapers in Saigon, licensed by the French authorities, were ordered to cease publication on the 16th by the French colonial authorities. The reason was that these newspapers revealed the true number of students killed by the French colonial authorities on January 9th. On January 9th, when Saigon students held a demonstration protesting the puppet authorities' illegal arrest of five students, French police used machine guns to fire on the demonstrating students, killing thirty-six and wounding many more, including one hundred with serious injuries. Afterwards, the French official news agency Agence France-Presse, in an attempt to cover up the atrocities of French imperialism, claimed that only one student was killed and a dozen or so were injured.
    Also, according to Vietnam News Agency's Hanoi dispatch: Among the several Vietnamese students detained by the "United Security Team" currently under French control in Hanoi, two have been killed by the French on January 1st after prolonged torture. These students were detained by the French during the Hanoi public school students' strike last November.

    法帝屠杀越南人民罪行
    西贡学生死伤百余人
    西贡报纸揭露真实数字竟被停刊
    【新华社北京十八日电】据越南通讯社消息：西贡有四家法方许可的越南报纸，十六日被法国殖民当局勒令停刊，原因是这几家报纸泄露了一月九日法国殖民当局屠杀学生的真实数字。一月九日，当西贡学生因抗议傀儡当局非法逮捕五名学生而举行示威游行时，法国警察竟以机枪扫射示威学生，打死三十六人，打伤者极多，其中有一百人伤势严重。事后，法国官方通讯社法新社为掩饰法帝国主义的暴行，仅说打死学生一人，打伤十余人。
    又据越南通讯社河内消息：现为法方控制下的河内“联合保安队”所拘押的数名越南学生中，有两人经长期严刑拷打后，已于一月一日被法国人杀害。这些学生是在去年十一月河内公立学校学生罢课时，被法国人拘押的。
