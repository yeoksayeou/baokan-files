[Rehe News] Primary school education in Rehe Province is gradually becoming standardized. Over the past year, more than 800 private schools have been transformed, and over 3,600 primary schools have been established and reorganized. According to recent statistics, there are 5,452 primary schools in the province, including 114 complete primary schools and 17 primary schools with attached senior classes. There are a total of 295,505 primary school students and 7,056 primary school teachers. Compared with 1948, the number of primary schools has increased by 182%, the number of primary school students has increased by 190%, and the number of primary school teachers has increased by 148%. Children of liberated peasants account for 45.4% of the primary school student population, an increase of 9% compared to 1948 and two and a half times more than in 1947. Together with the children of middle peasants, they account for 87% of the total.

The tendency to emphasize politics and neglect culture in schools has been gradually overcome. School administrative systems, grade levels, and curriculum standards have also been largely established. In order to improve teacher quality and remedy the shortage of teachers, all cities, counties, and banners in the province have utilized vacation periods to hold two primary school teacher training courses, with over 6,000 teachers receiving training. The first course focused on political study and ideological transformation; the second course focused on professional study, introducing typical experiences in teaching methods and researching teaching practices. The two training sessions were very effective, and 2,231 active teachers emerged from them. Some went deep into the masses to mobilize the children of poor peasants to enroll in school; others listened to the opinions of the masses and improved their teaching and child management methods. In areas severely affected by natural disasters, some teachers implemented half-day classes, teaching in the morning and evening, and teaching in the fields, and led children to collect wild vegetables and help farmers weed and hoe, integrating teaching with production and disaster relief. Some teachers led students to build school buildings themselves, collect waste paper in exchange for good paper, and dig white clay to make chalk in their spare time, in order to solve financial difficulties.

    热河小学教育渐趋正规化
    一年来学生增两倍
    训练教员六千余人，改造私塾八百余所。
    【热河讯】热河省小学教育渐趋正规化。一年来改造了私塾八百余所，建立与整顿小学三千六百余处。据最近统计，全省有小学校五千四百五十二所，其中完全小学占一一四所，初小附设高级班的有十七处。小学生共二十九万五千五百零五名；小学教员七千零五十六名。与一九四八年比较，小学校数增加百分之一百八十二，小学生增加百分之一百九十，小学教员增加百分之一百四十八。小学生中翻身农民子女已占百分之四五·四，较一九四八年增加百分之九，较一九四七年增加两倍半，与中农子女合计，共占百分之八十七。学校中逐渐克服了重政治轻文化的偏向，学校行政制度、学级编制、课程标准等也大体建立，为提高教员质量和补救教员数量的不足，全省各市、县、旗曾利用假期分别举办了两次小学教员训练班，受训教员达六千余人。第一次以政治学习为主，进行思想改造；第二次以业务学习为主，介绍教学方法上的典型经验，研究教学业务。两次训练收效很大，从中涌现了二千二百三十一名积极教员。有的深入群众，动员贫苦农民子弟入学，有的听取群众意见，改进教学与管理儿童的方式方法。在灾荒严重的地区，有的教员实行半日制，早晚教学、野外教学等办法，并领导儿童采野菜、帮助农民拔草、锄苗，使教学与生产救灾结合进行。有的教员领导学生在课余自己修建校舍、拾废纸换好纸、挖白土做粉笔等，以解决经费困难。
