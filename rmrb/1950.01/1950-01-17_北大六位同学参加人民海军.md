    Six Peking University Students Join the People's Navy
    [Beijing News] The Peking University New Democratic Youth League Committee held a send-off rally at 1:00 PM on the 14th on the lawn of the university's science building for six students - Communist Party member Zhang Yue and Youth League members Wei Wan, Zhang Motian, Gao Huaxi, Li Chenggong, and Guo Deru - who are joining the People's Navy. First, Ding Zuyong of the university's League Committee explained the process by which Zhang Yue and the other five students responded to the Party's call and resolved to join the People's Navy, calling on the students to learn from their excellent quality of resolutely serving the people. Then, representatives from the League branches of various departments delivered farewell speeches and presented books and "Victory Diaries," hoping that they would continue to improve their thinking and happily write down their victorious deeds. Finally, Wei Wan delivered a reply on behalf of the students joining the Navy, guaranteeing that they would dedicate themselves to the People's Navy without reservation. After the meeting, many students expressed that, educated by this meeting, they would more actively transform themselves and strive to join the League.
