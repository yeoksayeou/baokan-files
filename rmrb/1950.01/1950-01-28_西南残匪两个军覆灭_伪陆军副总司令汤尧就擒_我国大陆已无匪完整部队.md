    Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 27th: The last two complete units of the Kuomintang bandit gang remaining on mainland China—the Eighth Army and the Twenty-Sixth Army—have been completely annihilated, with the exception of a few who escaped. A unit of the People's Liberation Army, tasked with intercepting the remnants attempting to flee to Vietnam via the Yunnan-Vietnam border, tightly surrounded the bandit Eighth Army headquarters and its 42nd Division in the area north and east of Yuanjiang on the 23rd. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the entire bandit force was annihilated, and the pseudo-Army Deputy Commander-in-Chief Tang Yao, and bandit leaders such as Cao Tiange, the commander of the Eighth Army, were captured alive. The results of the battle are still being investigated. Prior to this, our army had successively captured Gejiu, Jianshui, and Shiping from the 17th to the 20th, annihilating the majority of the bandit Eighth Army and Twenty-Sixth Army, including killing bandit Eighth Army 237th Division Commander Li Xunfu, capturing bandit Deputy Division Commanders Wang Zongfu, Wang Xinyi, Chief of Staff Leng Zhongde, Political Work Director Sun Zhong, Twenty-Sixth Army Senior Staff Officer Liu Shirong, 193rd Division Deputy Division Commander Deng Shaohua, Chief of Staff Zuo Mengfu and more than 12,000 others. In addition, more than 3,000 remnants of the Third Division of the bandit Eighth Army surrendered to our army in the southwest area of Shiping. Our army seized a large number of spoils of war, including four anti-tank guns, 59 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 300 war horses. At this point, the Kuomintang bandit regular forces remaining in the southwest territory, with the exception of a few who escaped, have been completely annihilated.
