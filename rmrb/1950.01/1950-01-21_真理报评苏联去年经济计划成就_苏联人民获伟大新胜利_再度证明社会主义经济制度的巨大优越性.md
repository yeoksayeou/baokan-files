Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 20th: TASS, Moscow reports: All Soviet newspapers published on the 18th on the front page the communique of the Central Statistical Bureau of the Soviet Government on the results of the implementation of the 1949 state plan for the restoration and development of the Soviet national economy, and published editorials commenting on it.

	Pravda pointed out in its editorial: The communique of the Central Statistical Bureau vividly demonstrates the magnificent new victory of the Soviet people. Comrade Stalin once called the labor of millions of Soviet people the great, creative labor that determines the destiny of history. The powerful force of this creative labor is particularly evident in those heroic days when we were waging a nationwide struggle to complete Stalin's post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule. The Party of Lenin and Stalin inspires the Soviet people to obtain new labor achievements and directs all their efforts towards a single goal - building a communist society.

	The measures taken by the Soviet government to further improve work in industry have resulted in more effective utilization of production capacity, discovery of additional potential of enterprises, and savings in fuel, raw materials and other materials. All this enables the government to expand the previously adopted industrial production plan for 1949. This new annual industrial production plan has been exceeded by three percent as a whole.

	Pravda then pointed out: The achievements made in 1949 have given all Soviet people a deep sense of patriotic pride and once again demonstrated the great superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system. However, complacency and stagnation are not for the Soviet people. Our industry, transportation, agriculture - all sectors of the Soviet economy have great potential to be exploited. This potential was not properly utilized everywhere last year. The preparations for the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have brought new inspiration to the political and labor enthusiasm of workers, collective farmers and intellectuals. With the socialist competition unfolding on a larger scale, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, will achieve further achievements in all aspects of economic and cultural development, and will complete Stalin's post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule.

    真理报评苏联去年经济计划成就
    苏联人民获伟大新胜利
    再度证明社会主义经济制度的巨大优越性
    【新华社北京二十日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联所有报纸均于十八日以头版地位刊载苏联政府中央统计局关于一九四九年恢复与发展苏联国民经济国家计划执行结果的公报，并发表社论，予以评论。
    真理报在社论中指出：中央统计局的公报，生动地证明了苏联人民蔚为大观的新胜利。斯大林同志曾把千百万苏联人民的劳动称为决定历史命运的伟大的、创造性的劳动。这种创造性劳动的强大力量，在我们为提前完成斯大林战后五年计划而进行全国性斗争的那些英雄日子里特别明显。列宁和斯大林的党鼓舞着苏联人民去获取新的劳动业迹，并把他们的全部努力导向一个单一的目标——建设共产主义社会。
    苏联政府为进一步改进工业中的工作而采取的措施。其结果已使生产能力得到更有效的利用，使企业额外的潜力得到发现，燃料、原料及其他材料得到节省。这一切使政府能扩大原先通过的一九四九年的工业生产计划。这个新的全年工业生产计划，已整个地被超过了百分之三。
    真理报接着指出：一九四九年所获得的成果，使全体苏联人民有着深湛的爱国自豪，并再度证明了社会主义经济制度对于资本主义经济制度的巨大优越性。然而，志得意满和故步自封是与苏联人民无缘的。我们的工业、运输业、农业——苏维埃经济的一切部门，都有着可资利用的巨大潜力。这些潜力在去年并不是处处都已很恰当地被利用了。为选举苏联最高苏维埃而进行的准备工作，已给工人、集体农民和知识分子的政治与劳动方面的积极性带来了新的振奋。更大规模地展开社会主义竞赛，苏联人民在列宁和斯大林党的领导下将会在经济与文化发展的各方面获得进一步的成就，并将提前完成斯大林战后五年计划。
