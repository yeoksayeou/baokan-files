Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 28th: TASS Ulan Bator, January 27th: Lhamsuren, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic, recently issued a statement to the press regarding the speech made by US Secretary of State Acheson on January 12th at the National Press Club in Washington concerning US policy towards Asia. In his statement, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic stated: Acheson's speech contains slanderous defamation against our loyal and selfless friend, the Soviet Union, against the Mongolian People's Republic, and against our friendly People's Republic of China. His speech has aroused a wave of profound indignation among all the Mongolian people. Since Acheson has indulged in such anti-Soviet hysteria, attempting not only to slander the Soviet Union's just foreign policy but also to distort historical facts that should be known to him, at least due to his official position, I must recall these facts that Acheson has so shamelessly distorted.

	The Soviet Union Has Always Strictly Respected Mongolia's Freedom, Independence, and Sovereignty

Acheson said: "The Soviet Union is detaching northern regions of China and attaching them to the Soviet Union, a process that has already been completed in Outer Mongolia." This assertion by Acheson is an utter and insolent lie. It is well known that the Soviet Union was the first country to announce to the world, as early as August 1919, its recognition of the Mongolian people's right to free and independent existence. At that time, the Soviet government said in its telegram to the Mongolian people: "Mongolia is a free country. All power in the country belongs to the free people, and no foreigner has the right to interfere in Mongolia's internal affairs." The Mongolian people know very well that the Soviet Union, in its relations with the Mongolian People's Republic as a sovereign state, just as in its relations with all other nations, large and small, has always strictly adhered to these principles, and still does.

The fact that these principles of maintaining equal relations with other countries have aroused the malicious clamor of people like Acheson, the architects of policies aimed at seizing the territories of other nations and enslaving various ethnic groups, does not surprise us. It is also known that as a result of the People's Revolution of 1921, the Mongolian people, in their arduous struggle against domestic and foreign oppressors, won the right to free and independent existence. This revolution freed the Mongolian people from generations of enslavement.

In those years that were equally difficult for the Soviet Union, the great Soviet people were the first to extend a hand of friendship to help the deeply suffering Mongolian people. We also know that the Soviet Union has consistently provided us with enormous, comprehensive, and selfless assistance every day throughout the years of our republic's existence. It is only because of this assistance that the Mongolian people have been able to defend and consolidate their national independence and achieve great successes in their economic, political, and cultural development. These achievements are welcomed by all sincere advocates of peace and democracy and are well known throughout the world. Acheson is well aware of these achievements. If he attempts to slander these achievements, he can only expose the true purpose of his speech.

	Acheson Should Remember That the US Government Formally Recognized Mongolia as a Sovereign State in the Yalta Agreement

Acheson cannot be unaware of the fact that the US government formally recognized the Mongolian People's Republic as a sovereign state in the Yalta Agreement of February 11, 1945. Acheson also knows that, based on the results of the plebiscite on October 20, 1945, the former Chinese government formally recognized the independence of the Mongolian People's Republic on January 5, 1946. The Mongolian People's Republic and the former Chinese government established diplomatic relations on February 13, 1946. It is also known that the People's Republic of China, from the very first days of its existence, established sincerely friendly relations with the Mongolian People's Republic. Normal diplomatic relations have been established between the two countries. It is also known that the Mongolian People's Republic maintains diplomatic relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of Albania and maintains sincerely friendly relations with many other countries.

It is unnecessary to recall that the armed forces of the Mongolian People's Republic participated in the common struggle of freedom-loving nations against the fascist aggressors, Japanese imperialism. The gentlemen of the US State Department, who trample on the legitimate rights of freedom-loving nations for the sake of realizing their imperialist goals, are also well aware of these facts.

However, these are precisely the facts that Acheson did not mention at all after spreading rumors about the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and our country. But the truth is more powerful than all kinds of rumors and slanders. The ordinary people of the world know very well that the Soviet Union, which is at the forefront of the entire democratic camp, and the freedom-loving people of the world (including the people of China and the Mongolian People's Republic) are guarding peace, security, and international friendship.

    蒙外长拉姆苏伦发表声明
    斥艾奇逊无耻诽谤
    揭露艾奇逊企图破坏中苏蒙友好关系的阴谋
    【新华社北京二十八日电】塔斯社乌兰巴托尔二十七日讯：蒙古人民共和国外交部长拉姆苏伦，顷为美国国务卿艾奇逊一月十二日在华盛顿美国全国新闻俱乐部所作关于美国对亚洲政策的演说，向报界发表声明。蒙古人民共和国外交部长在其声明中称：艾奇逊的演说包含着对我们忠实与无私的友人苏联、对蒙古人民共和国和对我们友好的中华人民共和国的污蔑性的诽谤。他的演说激起了全体蒙古人民深为愤慨的浪潮。既然艾奇逊大发其反苏歇斯底里，不仅企图诽谤苏联公正的外交政策，而且还企图歪曲那些至少由于艾奇逊的官方地位而应当为他所知晓的历史事实，我就必须追述这些为艾奇逊所无耻地加以歪曲的事实。
            苏联一向严格尊重蒙古的自由独立与主权
    艾奇逊说：“苏联正在使中国北部地区脱离中国，并使它们依附苏联，这种过程已在外蒙古完成了。”艾奇逊这一论调是彻头彻尾的无礼的谎言。众所周知，苏联是早在一九一九年八月，第一个向世界宣布承认蒙古人民享有自由、独立生存之权利的国家。就在那时，苏联政府在其致蒙古人民的电文中说：“蒙古是自由的国家。国家的一切权力均属于自由的人民，没有任何一个外国人有权干涉蒙古的内政。”蒙古人民知道得很清楚，苏联在与作为主权国家的蒙古人民共和国的关系上，正如在与其他一切大小民族的关系上一样，过去始终是，而且现在仍然是严格地遵守这些原则的。
    这些与其他国家维持平等关系的原则，激起了旨在攫夺其他民族领土与奴役各民族的政策的制订人如艾奇逊之流的恶毒叫嚣，这一事实对我们是并不惊异的。大家也知道，由于一九二一年人民革命的结果，蒙古人民在反对国内外压迫者的艰巨斗争中，赢得了自由、独立生存的权利，这一革命使蒙古人民摆脱了历代以来被奴役的境地。
    在苏联也是同样困难的那些年月中，伟大的苏联人民第一个伸出友谊的手来帮助苦难深重的蒙古人民。我们也知道，苏联在我们的共和国存在的这些年月中，一直都是每天给予我们以巨大的、各方面的、无私的援助。只是由于这种援助，蒙古人民才能够保卫与巩固他们的国家独立，并在他们的经济、政治与文化的发展中获致巨大的成就。这些成就为一切和平与民主的真诚拥护者所高兴，并为举世所周知。艾奇逊对这些成就也知道得很清楚。如果他企图诽谤这些成就，那么，他只能暴露出他的演说的真正目的来。
    艾奇逊应记得美国政府在雅尔塔协定中已正式承认蒙古为一主权国家
    艾奇逊不会不知道这样的事实，即：美国政府在一九四五年二月十一日雅尔塔协定中，正式承认蒙古人民共和国作为一个主权国家而存在。艾奇逊也知道，根据一九四五年十月二十日公民投票的结果，前中国政府在一九四六年一月五日正式承认了蒙古人民共和国的独立，蒙古人民共和国与前中国政府之间，并于一九四六年二月十三日建立了外交关系。人们也知道，中华人民共和国自其存在的最初几天起，即与蒙古人民共和国建立了真诚友好的关系。在这两国之间，正常的外交关系已经建立起来。人们还知道，蒙古人民共和国与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国之间保持着外交关系，并与许多其他国家保有真诚友好的关系。
    蒙古人民共和国军队曾经参加爱好自由民族反对法西斯侵略者、日本帝国主义的共同斗争一事，是无须追忆的。为了实现其帝国主义目的的利益、而蹂躏爱好自由民族的合法权利的美国国务院的绅士们，对于这些事实也是知道得很清楚的。
    可是这些正是艾奇逊在对苏联、中华人民共和国与我国进行造谣之后只字未提的事实。但真理比各种各样的谣言和诽谤都更有力。全世界的普通人民都知道得很清楚，走在整个民主阵营最前面的苏联和世界爱好自由的人民（包括中国与蒙古人民共和国的人民在内），是在警卫着和平、安全与国际友谊。
