    Improved Organic Chemistry Experiments
    New Textbook Compiled by Wang Kui of Yenching University
    [Our Newspaper] To adapt to the current environment and needs of our country, Wang Kui, a research assistant in the Chemistry Department of Yenching University, has compiled a new organic chemistry experiment textbook based on his three to four years of experience in microchemical experiment techniques. Yenching University will adopt it starting next semester. This is a new attempt with several characteristics: (1) This textbook uses semi-micro and micro experimental techniques, greatly saving time and drugs. For example, an experiment that previously required one hour of heating can now be completed in ten minutes. Time can be saved by one-third, thus enabling the addition of new experiments. The most savings are in drugs; the amount of chemicals previously used by one student can now be used by an entire class of more than seventy people. (2) This textbook is closely linked to other departments. Eight out of ten compounds produced in the experiments can be used in other chemical experiments. For example, in the past, methyl orange was used as an example of azo dye, resulting in a large amount of unused methyl orange. Now, it has been changed to preparing magnesium reagent, a compound urgently needed in inorganic qualitative analysis. (3) All the instruments used in the new experiment textbook, except for test tubes, beakers, and side-arm test tubes, can be made by the students themselves. This not only solves the current difficulty in preparing instruments but also helps students overcome difficulties in material conditions when they go to work in factories in the future. (4) In the past, many chemicals used in experiments came from abroad. This experiment textbook tries to use drugs that can be produced in our country as much as possible. (5) Previous chemistry experiment textbooks were written in English. This new textbook is written entirely in Chinese. (Yenching University Communications Group)

    改进有机化学实验
    燕大王夔编制新教程
    【本报讯】为了适应我国现在的环境与需要，燕大化学系研究助理王夔根据三四年的微量化学实验技术的经验，编制了一个新的有机化学实验教程，下学期起燕大即将采用。这是一个新的尝试，它具有不少特点：（一）这个教程使用半微量及微量实验技术，因而时间及药物均大为节省。例如以往需要加热一小时的一个实验，现在可以在十分钟内完成。时间可以节省三分之一，因之能增加新的实验。在药物方面节省最多，有的实验在以前一个同学所用的药品，现在可以够一班七十多人之用了。（二）这个教程是和其他部门密切联系的，实验所作出来的化合物十分之八可以用在其他化学实验上。例如，以前作偶氮染料示例都作甲基橙，结果存了不少的甲基橙没有用处，现在改作镁试剂，这化合物正是无机化学定性分析中所急切需要的。（三）新实验教程中所用一切仪器，除试管、烧杯及支管试管外，完全可以由学生自制。这一方面解决了现在制备仪器的困难，另一方面更可帮助同学在将来去工厂工作时，克服物质条件的困难。（四）以往作实验很多药品是从外国来的，这个实验教程则尽量采用了我国可以出品的药物。（五）以往的化学实验教程都是用英文写的，这个新的教程完全使用中文。（燕大通讯组）
