[This Newspaper Reported] The mat weavers of Wen'an Depression in Hebei are displaying a spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity in the self-salvation through production movement, uniting to overcome difficulties in production and survive the famine. Most of the 2,807 mat weavers in the county do not have reed fields, and they all go to reed-producing areas such as Zuogezhuang and Wugeda to buy reeds. However, many mat weavers cannot afford to buy enough reeds to weave due to lack of capital. For example, the Jin Shateng family of five in Huangdian Village relies on two people weaving mats for a living. Because of the small capital, the reeds they buy are not enough to weave (for five days). They can only buy grain and reeds after selling the mats on market day; sometimes they cannot sell them, so they cannot buy reeds, and the whole family stops working. In order to help the mat weavers solve this difficulty, the Wen'an County Government called on village cadres to lead the mat weavers to buy reeds on credit from reed-producing areas, and discussed the issue of mutual assistance, fraternity, and unity to survive the famine at the representative meeting of all sectors of the county. After the meeting, village representatives and party member cadres actively led the mat weavers to buy reeds on credit from reed-producing areas. Li De, a farmer representative from Lizhuang Village, contacted Zhang Wangui (village party secretary), a farmer representative from Chongxin Village, to buy reeds from his village on credit. After both parties agreed on the price, payment was made in cash or grain after the mats were sold, and the district provided a guarantee. In this way, they bought 900 reeds on credit (each can weave two and a half mats). Other villages also bought reeds collectively on credit, which solved the problem of not having enough to weave. In the process of weaving mats, the mat weavers also displayed the spirit of mutual help. Wu Jinggui of Xicaozhuang had no reeds and no capital. Zhang Genrui had many reeds and could not finish weaving them all at once. Seeing Jinggui staring blankly, he gave Jinggui some reeds on credit, allowing Jinggui to weave mats, sell them, and then pay him back. Wu Heping had reeds but did not know how to weave mats; the widow Wang Dana had no reeds and no capital, and could not even go to the market to buy and sell. The village cadres coordinated and helped the two families to implement mutual assistance. Wu Heping was in charge of rolling mats, doing odd jobs, and going to the market to buy and sell; Wang Dana was only in charge of weaving, and the money earned was divided equally. This way, both families were able to maintain their livelihoods. The water towns have small rooms. The Huang Guanglin family in Huangdian Village lived in one room, and two women weaving mats could not spread out. They wove in the courtyard when it was warm, but it was not possible in winter. Mat weaver Huang Qintang had an outer room that was idle, so he let Huang Guanglin occupy it, and the Huanglin family could work without delay. The director of the women's association in Xianzhuang Village was the only one who could weave mats. She weaved and taught at the same time, and twenty or thirty women followed her to learn every day, watching her string reeds, start the weave, and weave the edges. In a month, seven women learned to weave. Huang Mihu of Huangdian Village always sold his mats for less money than others, three liang of corn less per mat. In order to help him improve the quality of his mats, the village branch asked Song Yihou, a party member who wove mats in the same courtyard as him, to help him. After more than a month of effort, Mihu's weaving was as good as others'. Because the mat weavers displayed the spirit of mutual assistance to survive the famine, the lives of more than 2,000 mat weavers in the county were guaranteed. In order to solve the problem of mat sales, the county supply and marketing cooperative specially established a mat branch in Zuogezhuang, using grain to exchange for mats, which gave the mat weavers great convenience and increased their confidence in surviving the famine.

    文安县干部重视救灾
    领导席户互助渡荒
    县供销社负责解决销路
    两千八百余席户生活有保障
    产苇户和织席户定好价钱  卖席付款或付粮区里作保
    会织席的帮助不会织的  织得好的帮助织得差的
    【本报讯】河北文安洼席民在生产自救运动中，发扬互助友爱精神，团结渡荒，克服了生产中的困难。全县二千八百零七个席民，大部没有苇地，都是到左各庄、五圪垯等产苇地区去买。可是好多席民因为本钱少，买来的苇子供不上织。比如黄淀庄金傻腾家五口人，指着两个人织席为生，因为本小，买来的苇子不够织（五天的）。到了集日把席卖出后，才能籴粮食买苇子；有时候卖不了，就不能买苇，一家子就歇工。文安县政府为帮助席民解决这个困难，号召各村干部，领导席民到产苇地区赊买，并在全县各界代表会上，讨论了如何互助友爱，团结渡荒的问题。会后，各村代表和党员干部，都积极的领导了席民，到产苇地去赊买苇子。李庄农民代表李德，到崇新村找农民代表张万贵（村支部书记）接洽好，赊买他村的苇子。经双方定好价钱，卖了席交钱或粮食，区里给作保。这样赊买了九百个苇子（每个能织两领半席）。其他村庄，也都集体赊买了苇，这就解决了供不上织的困难。在织席当中，席民们又发挥了互相帮助的精神，西曹庄吴景桂，没苇子又没本钱。张根瑞苇子多，自己一时织不完，他见景桂干瞪眼，就把苇子赊给了景桂一部，让景桂织出席卖出后再还他。吴和平有苇子不会织席；寡妇王大娘没苇子又没本，还不能赶集买卖。村干部当中一串通，帮助他两家实行互助，吴和平专管轧席做零活赶集买卖；王大娘只管织，赚了钱对半分，这一下两家都能维持生活了。水乡房间小，黄淀庄黄广林家住着一间房，两个妇女织席放不开，暖和时候在院里织，冬天可不行了。席民黄勤堂有个外间屋闲着，就叫黄广林占了，广林家做起活来就不耽误了。线庄村只妇会主任自己会织席，她一面织，一面教，每天有二三十个妇女跟她学，看她串苇、起头和织边。一个月的工夫，有七个妇女学会织了。黄淀庄黄迷胡，织的席总是比别人少卖钱，一领席少卖三两玉米，村支部为帮助他提高席子的成色，就叫和他在一个院里织席的党员宋义厚去帮助他。经过一个多月的努力，迷胡织的和别人的席一样好了。由于席民们发挥了互助渡荒的精神，全县两千多席民生活就有了保障。县供销社为解决席的销路问题，在左各庄专门设立席业分社，用粮食换买席子，这给了席民很大方便，增加了席民们渡荒的信心。
