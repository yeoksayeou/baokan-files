    I.

    In the past, under the long-term oppression and exploitation of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Chinese people lived with a lack of the material necessities of life, resulting in a decline in their health. In various places, one could find people with incomplete physical development, and people groaning in the pain of disease. From the Northeast, Southeast to the Southwest regions, various types of plague spread year after year. Kala-azar spread from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to its upper reaches, even reaching the Northwest region. Japanese schistosomiasis was prevalent throughout the Yangtze River basin, even reaching Guangdong and Guangxi. Malaria was scattered throughout the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Pearl River basins, and dysentery and cholera were inevitable every summer and autumn. Various types of typhoid fever spread to every corner of China. Infant mortality rates in some areas reached 50 percent. The threat of these diseases not only weakened the people's labor force, depleted the national economy, and disrupted the normal order of social life, but also affected the people's mental state.

    In the past, the people suffered so much from the pain of disease, but had nowhere to turn for help. Experience has proven that under the bloody reactionary rule, the people could not get health assistance from the rulers, and what they suffered was only devastation. Precisely because of this, the Chinese people not only resolved to end the political and economic oppression of reactionary rule by revolutionary means, but also to end the disease disasters caused by reactionary rule. Also, precisely because the old rulers of China disregarded the people's disease disasters, the medical legacy that the people took over from the old rulers was pitifully small. Various epidemics raged across the country, but there were no sound epidemic prevention and research institutions. The disease rate among the people was very high, but there were only more than 30,000 hospital beds, mostly concentrated in large cities. According to normal needs, there should be about three million beds of various types. There are currently only about 20,000 regular doctors in the country. If calculated at one doctor per thousand people, there is still a shortage of about 450,000. There was not a single chemical pharmaceutical factory with a modern scale in the country.

    Every people's medical worker, when he comes into contact with the reality of the huge disparity between objective requirements and subjective strength, will inevitably feel that the burden he bears is too heavy. At the same time, it is precisely because of contact with such a reality that a warm sympathy sprouts in their hearts, driving them to fight for the people's health cause. The heroic struggle and victory of the Chinese people also encouraged the medical workers' confidence in achieving success.

    II.

    Due to the weakness of the existing medical forces, especially because the direction of the new China's politics, economy, and culture is to serve the people, the health construction work has determined the policy of "prevention first, treatment as secondary, and establishing a relationship of interdependence and connection between the two." Only by adopting such a policy to prevent the occurrence of diseases and eliminate the sources can we seize the initiative in our work, instead of going around in circles following diseases and plugging loopholes. Also, it is not right to divide the forces equally between prevention and treatment, because the original strength is already very weak. If it is further divided equally, it will feel thin and insubstantial. The results will not be good.

    In order to grasp this policy and apply it to specific work, the Ministry of Health at the central level and even the grassroots health organizations should determine problems, organize forces, and check work according to this standard in terms of personnel allocation, financial expenditure, educational content, and work deployment.

    III.

    Because China is vast, has a large population, and has complex diseases, how to start health work must be the first issue for people's medical workers to consider. We feel that:

    First, because our current central task is economic recovery and development, health workers should first guarantee economic work.

    Second, our health forces are not strong, and we can only grasp the most necessary parts, and we must never distribute forces evenly.

    Therefore, our work focuses on: "In cities, the prevention and treatment of diseases in industry, mining, transportation, and transportation industries is the main focus; in rural areas, the prevention and treatment of epidemics and endemic diseases is the main focus; maternal and child health care is a cause that is equally important in both urban and rural areas."

    According to this focus, health organs at all levels should use this as a standard in formulating plans, organizing forces, and checking work.

    IV.

    In order to complete the health work policy and tasks, the following efforts are still needed:

    First, we must unite, transform, and improve all new and old health and medical personnel, and strive for the new China's health construction under a unified will—serving the people. In the past, there were factional struggles in the Western medicine field. As for the discord between the Chinese and Western medicine fields, it is also a fact, thus consuming a lot of China's only strength in the health field, which is unfortunate for China's health field and unfortunate for the health cause of the Chinese people. In the future, this misfortune should be eliminated, and factional struggles and discrimination should be abandoned. We must call for the great unity of the medical community. As long as he is willing and determined to serve the people and has a skill, no matter where he comes from, which country or school he learned from, Chinese medicine or Western medicine, he must be given room to work, study, and develop. Every health worker must know that his responsibility is to serve the people's health cause, and it is an honor to complete the task. To complete the task, it is necessary to unite all forces. It is impossible to complete the task by fighting alone. Therefore, in the use of personnel and administration, we must take care of all aspects, and we must take care of all aspects when looking at problems. We must unite the medical community like one person and form a strong health force.

    Second, in order to make the achievements of health work universal and penetrate into every corner, it is difficult to do so with only a small number of health personnel. Therefore, health work must become a broad mass movement, so that the broad masses of the people can consciously participate in health work, the effect of which is limitless. The Northeast captured 13 million rats in 1949 for plague prevention, which was the result of mobilizing the masses to participate in health work. In order to get the masses to participate in health work, we must first make the masses understand the significance of health work and its relationship to their own interests. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out health propaganda and education work among the masses, and give them many practical examples to see. When the masses understand, they will inevitably take the initiative to participate. Then the health personnel will not feel isolated and helpless, the work will be full of vitality, and the results will inevitably be greater. But we must remember that this is an arduous work and a long-term work. The Northeast was able to capture so many rats because health workers, under the leadership of the Communist Party, mobilized the masses in the countryside to participate in health work for three years. The power of this force is impossible to describe with numbers.

    Third, the broad masses of the people have an urgent demand for health care, and the enthusiasm of the people's health workers to fulfill their responsibilities is high and boiling. However, this can only be one aspect of determining the problem. We must know that the war has not completely ended, and the war wounds need to be healed urgently. Therefore, in terms of our economic strength and the preparation of talents and materials, we must never allow health work to flourish in 1950 and even in the next few years. Therefore, whether in formulating plans or carrying out work steps, we need to estimate this characteristic, and consider problems in the spirit of a realistic foundation and taking care of all aspects, grasp the key points, distinguish the priorities and urgency, formulate plans, and solve problems.

    V.

    At the first National Health Administration Conference in November 1949, all unanimously expressed their willingness to shoulder the task of the Chinese people's health cause, and passed the working policies and tasks of the health department in the future. 1950 will be the first year for the dissemination of health work policies and tasks and the beginning of testing in practical work, and it will also be the first year for the people's health workers to bear the burden and test themselves. Although the burden is heavy, the confidence is also very firm, because we have the support of the great Chinese people, the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will surely win victory.

    为人民保健事业而努力
    新业
            一、
    过去中国人民在帝国主义与国民党反动派长期的压迫剥削下，过着缺乏为人所必需的物质生活条件，从而健康水平也随之降低了；在各地方可以发现体格发现不全的人，可以发现呻吟在疾病痛苦中的人。从东北，东南以至西南的许多地区，年年传播着各型鼠疫。由长江下游，蔓延至长江上游的黑热病，以至发展到西北地区。日本住血吸虫病遍布长江流域，以至两广。疟疾散布在黄河、长江与珠江流域，痢疾霍乱是每年夏秋季节必然发现的。各型伤寒遍布在全中国各个角落，婴幼的死亡率有的地区达到百分之五十。这些疾病的威胁，不只削弱了人民的劳动力，损耗了国家经济，紊乱了正常的社会生活秩序，亦且影响到人民的精神状况。
    过去人民是遭受到那样多的疾病痛苦，但却是求告无门。经验证明，在血腥的反动统治下面，人民是得不到统治者的保健帮助，所遭受到的只是摧残。正因为如此，中国人民不只决心用革命手段结束反动统治的政治经济压迫，并从而要结束反动统治所造成的疾病灾难。也正因为中国旧统治者漠视人民的疾病灾难，所以人民从旧统治者那里接管过来的医药遗产也是渺小得可怜。各种流行病在全国横行，却没有健全的防疫与研究机构。在人民中疾病率很大，却只有三万多个病床，且多集中在大城市。如按正常需要，各种病床应有三百万左右；医生现全国只有正规医生二万左右，如以千人一名计，尚差四十五万左右。在全国没有一家具备着近代规模的化学制药厂。
    每个人民医务工作者，当他接触到客观要求与主观力量悬殊绝大的现实时候，就必然感觉到所担负的担子太沉重了。而同时，也正因为接触了这样的现实，在他们的心里茁生出一种热烈的同情心，推动着自己去为人民的保健事业奋斗。中国人民的英勇斗争和胜利，也鼓励了医务工作者的获得成功的信心。
            二、
    由于现有的医药力量之薄弱，特别是由于新中国政治经济文化的方向，是为人民服务的，因此，卫生建设工作就确定了“以预防为主，治疗为辅，并建立两者间依存与联系的关系”的方针。只有采取这样的方针，去防止疾病的产生，杜绝来源，才能使我们掌握到工作的主动性，而不是随着疾病去打圈子，塞漏洞。又如果在预防与治疗两方面平分力量，亦是不对的，因为本来的力量就很薄弱，如再加以平分，那就会感到稀薄无物了。其成果是不会好的。
    由于要掌握着这个方针，并把它运用到具体工作中去，因此中央一级的卫生部以至基层卫生组织，就应在人力分配上，财政开支上，教育内容上，工作布置上，依照这个尺度去决定问题，组织力量，检查工作。
            三、
    由于中国地大，人口多，疾病复杂，卫生工作从何着手，必然成为人民医务工作者首先要考虑的问题，我们觉得：
    第一、因为我们当前的中心任务是经济的恢复与发展，所以，卫生工作者，首先应给经济工作以保证。
    第二、我们的卫生力量是不雄厚的，只能抓住最必要的部分，绝不能平均分配力量。
    因此我们的工作重点：“城市以工矿、交通、运输业中防治疾病为主；农村则以防治流行病、地方病为主；妇婴保健为城乡并重的事业”。
    根据这样的重点，各级卫生机关在制定计划上，组织力量上，检查工作上，都应以此为尺度。
            四、
    为要完成卫生工作的方针与任务，尚须做以下的努力：
    第一、必须团结、改造与提高一切新老卫生医药人员，在统一意志——为人民服务——之下，为新中国卫生建设而努力。在过去西医界里存在过派系的斗争，至于中西医界间的不协调亦是事实，从而将中国卫生界的仅有力量，损耗了不少，是中国卫生界的不幸，亦是中国人民健康事业的不幸。今后，应当消除这种不幸，应当唾弃派系的斗争和歧视，要号召医学界的大团结，只要他愿意和决心为人民服务，有一技之长，不论他来自何方，学自何国何校，中医或西医，都要使他有工作学习和发展余地。要使得每个卫生工作者知道自己的责任，是为人民的保健事业服务，完成了任务，才是光荣。要完成任务就必须团结一切力量，孤单作战，是无法完成任务的。因此在用人行政上，必须照顾到各方面，看问题必需照顾全面，要将医药界团结成一个人一样，形成一支有力的卫生部队。
    第二、要使卫生工作的成就，能普遍深入到每个角落，单靠少数的卫生人员是难以做到的，因此必须使卫生工作，成为广泛的群众运动，使广大人民群众能自觉的参加卫生工作，那种效果是无限量的。东北为防鼠疫在一九四九年捕鼠一千三百万只，就是发动了群众参加卫生工作的结果。为要使群众参加卫生工作，首先就必须使得群众了解卫生工作的意义和对其本身的利害关系；因此就必须在群众中进行卫生宣传教育工作，要举许多实际例子给他们看。当群众了解之后，必然自动起来参加。那么卫生人员，就不会感到孤立无援了，工作就会有生气了，成果就必然会大了。但必须记住，这是一个艰苦的工作，长期的工作。东北能捕那样多的老鼠，是卫生工作者在共产党的领导下，三年来在乡村发动群众参加卫生工作的结果，这种力量之大，是无法以数字去形容的。
    第三、广大人民对保健事业的要求是迫切的，人民卫生工作者完成自己责任的热忱是高的、沸腾着的，但这只能是决定问题的一方面。必须知道，战争还未完全结束，而战争创伤又急待医治，因此在我们的经济力量上，人材与物质准备上，绝不能使卫生工作在一九五○年以至于以后几年内百废俱兴。所以无论在制定计划，或进行工作的步骤上，都需要估计到这一特点，并在现实基础与照顾全面的精神下考虑问题，抓住重点，分别先后缓急，制定计划，解决问题。
            五、
    一九四九年十一月的全国第一次卫生行政会议上，全体一致地愿将中国人民保健事业的任务担负起来，并通过了今后卫生部门的工作方针与任务。一九五○年将是卫生工作方针与任务的传播和开始在实际工作中考验的第一年，也是人民卫生工作者负着担子考验自己的第一年。担子虽是沉重的，然而信心也是很坚定的，因为我们有伟大中国人民的支援，共产党和毛主席的领导，我们必然能获得胜利的。
