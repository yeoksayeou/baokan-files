	Review of "The Rhinoceros in the Room" and "The Heirloom"
	Zhú Kěyǔ
	"The Rhinoceros in the Room" was published last October, and "The Heirloom" was published this April, both in the People's Daily. These are Zhao Shuli's latest two works, now available as separate publications. By comparing and contrasting these two works, we can illustrate a very important issue in creation: an issue that was not resolved in "The Rhinoceros in the Room," but was basically resolved in "The Heirloom." The resolution of this issue provides a good educational answer to the writer's deep understanding of rural areas, the writer's realistic ideological principles and creative methods, and the relationship between the popularization and improvement of works. We are all saying "Learn from Zhao Shuli" now, so we hope to gain experience and lessons from the creation of these two works.

	"The Rhinoceros in the Room" sparked controversy after its publication. The People's Daily published a total of six articles on December 21, 1948, and January 16, 1949, of which the more important were Dang Ziqiang's "Thoughts After Reading," which strictly criticized many of the work's shortcomings, and Geng Xi's "Casual Talk," which provided a very detailed defense of the work. The opinions of the two were almost completely opposite, but no further opinions on the debate were seen afterward, and the issue became an open question.

	From the title of "The Rhinoceros in the Room," the author views Ruan Ying and Xiao Bao as "upright," and Xiao Dan and Xiao Chang (as well as the unappearing Liu Xiyuan) as "evil." Ruan Ying and Xiao Bao have been suppressed for three or four years, but they were not ultimately suppressed, which is the meaning of evil not prevailing over uprightness.

	However, from the development of the events in the full text, the author's central idea (theme) is focused on the father-daughter relationship in a middle-peasant family, and concentrated on the arousal, development, and resolution of a contradictory issue between this father and this daughter. This issue is the marriage of the daughter, Ruan Ying. The reason this contradiction arises is due to the various material and family interests that the father, Ju Cai, as an older-generation middle peasant figure, is concerned about in this issue, while Ruan Ying, as the new generation, does not have these concerns. She does not want to marry Liu Zhong, the son of Liu Xiyuan, or marry Xiao Chang's fourteen-year-old child. She wants to marry Xiao Bao, whom she has had a crush on since she was little.

	The development and resolution of this contradictory issue must naturally be combined with the development of the entire rural reality of Xiahe Village, reflecting the Party's policy towards middle peasants in the countryside on the one hand, and the Party's marriage policy in the countryside on the other. The reasonable solution of these two policies, combined together, revolves around the development and resolution of the contradiction between Ju Cai and Ruan Ying, and the contradiction between Ju Cai and Ruan Ying is also reasonably resolved. Therefore, the theme of this novel is neither the love story of Ruan Ying and Xiao Bao (as Dang Ziqiang said), nor the Party's middle peasant policy issue (as Geng Xi said); the protagonists of this novel are neither Ruan Ying and Xiao Bao (as Dang Ziqiang said) nor Yuan Hai and Ju Cai (as Geng Xi said), but Ruan Ying and Ju Cai.

	At the same time, since the arousal, development, and resolution of this contradiction is concentrated on Ruan Ying's marriage problem, rather than on other issues related to a middle-peasant family, therefore, between Ju Cai and Ruan Ying, Ruan Ying is more important than Ju Cai, the new generation in the countryside is more important than the old generation. Similarly, what the author should first tell us is the Party's marriage policy in the countryside, followed by the middle peasant policy, and more importantly, to combine the two.

	What is the problem with "The Rhinoceros in the Room"?

	The problem lies in the author neglecting the positive main characters, the positive and main side of the contradiction. The author tells us a correct conclusion in "The Rhinoceros in the Room," but does not tell us a reasonable process, a reasonable direction. The author writes Ruan Ying as a passive character waiting for the problem to be solved. The author does not combine the marriage problems of rural youth with rural social problems, and does not point out a reasonable process of striving or struggle. Therefore, this problem, this character, does not give our readers the due educational significance.

	If we interpret Dang Ziqiang's (and several other comrades') criticisms from this understanding, many points are criticized correctly. But if a criticism does not grasp the center of the work and one-sidedly emphasizes the shortcomings, then his criticism will be excessive and unfair.

	The author is much more familiar with Ju Cai than with Ruan Ying. Ju Cai is indeed the most prominent and successful character in "The Rhinoceros in the Room." In those words "Let's see," and "Let's see again," the author vividly portrays the soul of the older generation of a middle-peasant family, the kindness and weakness in this soul. Every time I read to the end where he says, "This is really a place to reason," I am always moved by the effect that such reality has on such a character. Similarly, the author is much more familiar with Xiao Dan than with Xiao Bao. From his role as a matchmaker to becoming an activist and finally his confession, this entire process is basically reasonable and moving. Without the successful portrayal of this character, the success of Ju Cai's image would be greatly diminished. Of course, it is still possible to point out shortcomings, such as the author writing Liu Zhong as being too submissive, making the realistic basis for Xiao Dan's becoming an activist insufficient, but Xiao Dan is basically a successful character.

	Geng Xi's (and several other comrades') defense on this aspect is also necessary, because in this aspect, the work quite reasonably reflects reality and gives readers education. But this cannot cover up the main shortcomings of the work. Praising the shortcomings of a work as advantages will have a bad influence, both on the author and the readers.

	From the entire work of "The Rhinoceros in the Room," we can clearly see that the first two chapters are much better than the last two chapters, and the last chapter of the latter two is written better. The author's creative weakness is exposed in the third chapter. This shows that the author did not carefully consider the reasonable development process of Ruan Ying in the three years, and did not carefully become familiar with the Ruan Yings in the countryside, especially regarding their love lives. Therefore, the author has Ruan Ying play a little trick in front of Xiao Dan in the third chapter to avoid the difficult situation. At this time, the author also finds it impossible to deal with Ju Cai, who he is extremely familiar with. His initial show of attitude and subsequent silence are entirely to accommodate Ruan Ying's "little cleverness." This entire chapter gives readers a feeling of weakness, powerlessness, and unreality. This situation is also manifested in the first chapter, where the author spent a lot of effort to arrange a meeting scene between Ruan Ying and Xiao Bao, but that scene, as one comrade criticized, is not reasonable at all.

	In short, on the two sides of a contradiction, the author is good at expressing the backward side, but not good at expressing the forward side. On the problem that the author focused on expressing, he did not combine the entire historical trend to derive a reasonable solution process. This is the main and most basic weakness of "The Rhinoceros in the Room."

	And this weakness is basically well resolved in "The Heirloom."

	"The Heirloom," this short story of just over ten thousand words, writes about the contradictory relationship between a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in a poor peasant family in the countryside. The author profoundly reveals the historical essence of this most ordinary and most daily mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship, which is repeated tens of millions of times in rural families. We clearly see the conflicts in the lives and concepts of two generations of women in the countryside, see the old life and old concepts of women gradually dying, and new women's lives and new concepts gradually growing. It conquers the old and replaces the old. We see the entire history of the Chinese countryside passing through this conflict between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, heading to the future. The historical, painful wrinkles left on the mother-in-law's face are gradually being erased by the daughter-in-law's healthy brilliance. As Wang Binyang said in "On The Heirloom," this is "a chapter of history, a mirror" (see People's Daily, August 13th), and not just an ordinary novel.

	This mother-in-law, Li Chengniang, reveals the full picture of her life from her broken black box. That "needlework basket that is broken and patched, broken and patched, with various pieces of cloth patched together, I don't know how many layers," that "bundles of broken cloth, some tied with cloth strips, some tied with red string, some tied with threads of various colors, like files in an office numbered," speak of the traditional life and spiritual state of their generation for thousands of years. She uses her living rules established in the poor and cruel old days, such as "using only one bowl of water to wash a bowl of cabbage" and "not eating even half a kilogram of oil in a year," to oppose her daughter-in-law's various new life orders. That kind of old life rule has become so natural to her and has become a creed. We see an old soul, as if lifting an empty bucket with both hands, walking step by step with legs spread apart, walking towards us step by step. She forces us to think, leading our thoughts to penetrate into the distant years behind her, as if seeing into a bottomless ancient well. We see that when she discovers that the treasures she inherited from her mother are actually rejected by her daughter-in-law, history breaks under her feet, and she helplessly and weakly gives the leadership to her daughter-in-law.

	The daughter-in-law, Jin Gui, did not carry coal past us, she did not speak to us at the meeting, but she so convincingly believes that she doesn't know how many times she has carried coal, doesn't know how many meetings she has opened. We fondly hear her telling us in detail, word by word, "Women must participate in major labor." This is the real path to women's liberation. She has a good temper, is generous, and doesn't care about the mother-in-law's usual remarks, but when she and Xiao E's husband entered the house and heard the mother-in-law slandering herself in front of Xiao E, she pouted, because Xiao E's husband is her superior, and she doesn't deserve to be wronged. When the mother-in-law opened her mouth, she became much more amiable, because she had the opportunity to defend herself. When the mother-in-law mentioned the issue of leadership and said, "Let her destroy me first!" she really got a little angry. When she saw that Xiao E's husband was on her side, she immediately started handing over affairs in a harmonious manner. How natural and moving this whole process seems! When she spread her ledger in front of her mother-in-law, we saw that she was not spreading it in front of any old woman, she was spreading it in front of the entire old history. She is declaring to it, declaring the end of the suffering of old women and the victory of new women's lives and its future prospects.

	This is the outline of the contradiction between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in "The Heirloom." Because the author grasped the forward side of a contradiction, he grasped the entire contradiction. Because he delved into the souls of the new and old characters, he grasped the historical essence of this contradiction. And also because the author grasped the historical essence of this contradiction, he gave the new and old characters real life. This combination relationship between characters and contradictions provides a good example of the combination relationship between typical characters and typical environments. Only such works give readers rich ideological strength, and only such in-depth character typifications, such revelations of the essence of daily life that are repeated tens of millions of times in the countryside, can arouse universal educational effects among readers. And naturally, this first requires the author's serious creative attitude and a deep understanding of creative realism to be possible, to be able to reach.

	Then is there no shortcomings at all in "The Heirloom"? That is not the case. "The Heirloom" has a relatively serious shortcoming: this shortcoming is the issue of the attitude of our new generation towards the old generation. In "The Heirloom," Xiao E's husband appears as Jin Gui's leader and supporter. In the argument between Jin Gui and her mother-in-law, he once said, "Old lady! According to me, you only need to eat and dress well, and spend a few years of peaceful days. You don't need to manage the family affairs!" And again, "Old lady! It's not that you shouldn't manage, it's just that you are getting old, and you can't understand the new things now! You can't manage!" Finally, after the mother-in-law reluctantly admitted defeat, he laughed and said, "Didn't I originally tell you to 'spend a few years of peaceful days'?" These words, as a worldly cliché, will naturally exist, but putting it here forms this concept: that is, arranging the old generation outside the new life order, rather than leading them into the new life order to solve the contradiction between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. If from the perspective of a poor peasant family, there are very few examples of old women being able to sit down and enjoy a comfortable life, whether in the past or today. Secondly, the true meaning of leadership has an essential difference in the new society and the old society, and it is also different for new and old characters. For the mother-in-law, the issue of managing accounts is a matter of being in charge or leadership, for Jin Gui, the main meaning of leadership should not be here. Xiao E's husband once said in the novel: "... I think it's better to have Jin Gui hand over the housework to the old lady, so that the old lady can manage the housework, and Jin Gui can be cleaner and do more work!" If this can really be done, it is not only "better," but "very good." If the contradiction between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is solved in this direction, only by leading the mother-in-law into the new life order. And if it is introduced, only Jin Gui's leadership is more likely to be determined. And if the mother-in-law really enters the new order and appears very progressive, then what's wrong with giving the leadership to the mother-in-law? It should be pointed out that today, in the liberated areas of the countryside, there are a large number of mothers-in-law from poor peasant families who have class consciousness and participate in production labor. It is hoped that this will not be seen as a harsh request for the author Zhao Shuli.

    评《邪不压正》和《传家宝》
    竹可羽
    《邪不压正》发表在去年十月里，《传家宝》发表在今年四月里，都是在人民日报上。这是赵树理最新的两个作品，现已印有单行本。从这两个作品的对照比较中，能够说明一个创作上的极重要的问题：这个问题在《邪不压正》里没有得到解决，而在《传家宝》里基本上得到了解决。这个问题的解决，对于作家的深入农村，对于作家的现实主义的思想原则和创作方法，以及对于作品的普及和提高之间的关系问题，给了很好的教育性的解答。我们现在都在说“向赵树理学习”，所以希望能够从这两篇作品的创作中获得经验教训。
    《邪不压正》在发表以后，曾经引起过争论，人民日报在四八年十二月二十一日和四九年一月十六日一共发表了六篇文章，其中较重要的是党自强的《读后感》，严格地批评了这个作品的很多缺点，耿西的《漫谈》，为这个作品作了很详尽的辩护。两者的意见几乎完全是对立的，但以后没有再见到有关这争论的意见，这问题便成了悬案。
    《邪不压正》从这个标题来看，作者是把软英和小宝当作“正”来看，把小旦和小昌（还有个没出场的刘锡元）是作为“邪”来看的，软英和小宝一直被压了三四年，但最后没有被压住，就是邪压不了正的意思。
    但是，从全文的事件发展上看，作者的中心思想（主题）集中在一个中农家庭里的父女关系上，集中在这个父亲和这个女儿之间的一个问题的矛盾的引起，展开和解决。这个问题就是女儿软英的婚姻问题。这个矛盾之所以产生是父亲聚财作为一个老一辈的中农人物在这个问题的种种物质和家庭利益的顾虑上，而作为新一代的软英却没有这些顾虑，她不愿嫁给刘锡元的儿子刘忠，或者嫁给小昌的十四岁的娃娃，她要嫁给她从小就把小心儿放上了的小宝。
    这个问题的矛盾的展开和解决，自然而然地，必须结合着整个下河村农村现实的发展，一方面是党在农村中的中农政策反映，另一方面是党在农村中的婚姻问题政策的反映。这两个政策的合理的解决，互相结合在一起，环绕着聚财和软英之间的矛盾展开和解决，聚财和软英之间的矛盾也就得到合理的解决。因此，这篇小说的主题，既非软英和小宝的恋爱故事（党自强说），也非党的中农政策问题（耿西说）；这篇小说的主人公，既非软英和小宝（党自强说）、也非元孩和聚财（耿西），而是软英和聚财。
    同时，这个矛盾的引起、展开和解决，既然集中在软英的婚姻问题上，而不是集中在一个中农家庭有关的别的问题上，因此，在聚财和软英之间，更重要的是软英而不是聚财，是农村是中农家庭里的新的一代，而不是老的一代。也同样，作者首先应该告诉我们的是党在农村中的婚姻问题的政策，其次才是中农政策，更重要的是要使这两者结合起来。
    《邪不压正》的问题在那里呢？
    问题就在于作者把正面的主要的人物，把矛盾的正面和主要的一面忽略了，作者在《邪不压正》里告诉了我们一个正确的结论，没有告诉我们一个合理的过程，一个合理方向，作者把软英写成一个等待着问题解决的消极的人物，作者没有把农村青年的婚姻问题和农村社会问题结合起来，指出合理的争取或斗争过程，因此，这个问题这个人物，没有给与我们读者以应有的教育意义。
    党自强（和另外几个同志）的批评中，如果从这样的理解中来说，许多地方都是批评对了的。但一种批评如果没有抓住作品的中心，片面强调了缺点一方面，那末就会使得他的批评过了火，欠公正。
    作者对于聚财比起对软英来要熟悉得多。聚财确实是《邪不压正》中最凸出，最成功的一个，在“看看再说”和“再看看再说”那些话中，作者活画出一个中农家庭老一代的灵魂，这个灵魂中的善良和弱点。我每次读到最后他说：“这真是个说理的地方。”我总为这样的现实对这样的人物所产生的效果所感动。同样，作者对小旦，比起小宝来，要熟悉得多，从他做媒起到当积极分子再到他最后的坦白，这整个过程，基本上是合理的、动人的，没有这个人物的成功的描写，聚财的形象的成功是要大打折扣的。自然，要指摘缺点还是可以指摘的，如作者把刘忠写得过于服服贴贴，使得小旦之当成积极分子的现实基础不够了些，但小旦这个人物基本上是成功的。
    耿西（和另外几位同志）在有关这一方面而作的辩护，这也是必要的，因为在这方面，这个作品相当合理地反映了现实，给了读者的教育。但是这不能掩盖住这个作品的主要的缺点。对一个作品的缺点也当作优点来赞扬，这就要产生不好的影响，不论对作者还是读者。
    从《邪不压正》整个作品来说，我们看得清楚，前两章比后两章要好得多，后面两章中又是最后一章要写得好些，作者的创作的弱点，在第三章中暴露了出来。这说明着作者没有好好地去思索过软英在三年中的合理的发展过程，没有好好地去熟悉过农村中的软英们，特别关于他们这一代的爱情生活。因此，作者叫软英在第三章的小旦面前玩弄了一个小聪明来把难关躲过去，在这样的时候，作者对于他异常熟悉的聚财也变得无法对付起来，他的最初的耍态度，和后来的沉默，完全为了迁就软英的“小聪明”。这整个的一章给了读者以软弱无力和不真实的感觉，这种情形，同样也表现在第一章中，在那里，作者为了安排一个软英和小宝会面的场面，花了很多苦心，但是那个场面，正如有一位同志批评过一样，一点也不合情理。
    总之，在一个矛盾的两面，作者善于表现落后的一面，不善于表现前进的一面，在作者所集中要表现的一个问题上，没有结合整个历史的动向来得出合理的解决过程，这是《邪不压正》主要的最基本的弱点。
    而这个弱点，在《传家宝》里基本上得到了很好的解决。
    《传家宝》，这不过一万零些字数的小说，写了农村中一个贫农家庭里婆媳之间的矛盾关系，这个最平凡的，最日常的，在农村家庭里不知重复着几千万遍的婆媳关系，作者深刻地揭露了它的历史的本质。我们清楚地看到了农村两代妇女的生活和观念冲突，看到了妇女的旧的生活和旧的观念正在渐渐死去，新的妇女生活和新的观念在渐渐地成长中，它征服了旧的，代替了旧的；看到了整个中国农村的历史，从这一个婆媳间的冲突中通过，走向未来去。历史的，留在婆婆脸上的痛苦的皱纹，正在被媳妇的健康的光辉渐渐抹去，正如王宾阳的《说传家宝》中所说，这是“一章历史，一面镜子”（见八月十三日人民日报）。而不止是一篇普通的小说而已。
    这位婆婆，李成娘，从她那一只破黑箱子里，揭示了她的一生的全貌。那“破了就糊，破了就糊，各色破布不知道糊了多少层的针线筐”，那“一捆捆的，有用布条捆的，有用红头绳捆的，有用各种颜色线捆的，好像机关里的卷宗上编得有号码一样的破布”，说出了她们一代的几千年的传统的生活和精神状态。她用她“洗一碗白菜只用一碗水”，“一年也吃不了一斤油”等等，在贫困和残酷的旧的日子里建立起来的生活规律，来和她媳妇的种种新的生活秩序对立起来，那种旧的生活规律，对于她已经变得那样自然，而且成为一种信条了。我们看到一个年老的灵魂，仿佛两只手提起一个空水桶，走一步要叉开一下腿地，一步步走到我们面前来。她，逼着我们思索，引着我们的思想从她的背后透入久远的年代里去，好像看到无底的古井里去一样，我们看到，当她发觉她从娘手上承受下来的那些宝贝，居然为媳妇所拒绝的时候，历史在她脚下断开了，她无可奈何地，无力地把领导权让给了媳妇。
    媳妇金桂，她并没有背着煤走过我们面前，她并没有在会场上向我们发言，但是却如此信服地相信着她不知背了多少次煤，不知去开了多少次会，我们亲切地听到她在向我们算细账，她不止一次地一个字一个字告诉我们说：“妇女要参加主要劳动”这是妇女解放的真正的道路。她有着好脾性，大方，婆婆平常说几句，她满不在乎，但是她和小娥的丈夫进屋时，听到婆婆在小娥面前败坏自己，她鼓起了嘴来，因为小娥的丈夫是她的上级，她犯不着受冤曲，到了婆婆开了口，她却和气多了，因为她有机会辩白自己了，等到婆婆提起了关于领导权的问题时说：“叫她先灭了我吧！”她真正动了点小脾气，到她看到小娥丈夫是站在自己一边时，她马上和和气气地办起交待来，这整个过程，显得多自然！多动人！当她把她的账本在她婆婆面前摊开来的时候，我们看到了她不是摊在任何某一个年老的妇女面前，她是摊在整个旧的历史前面。她在向它宣告，宣告旧的妇女的痛苦的结束和新的妇女生活的胜利和它的未来的远景。
    这就是《传家宝》里婆媳间矛盾的梗概，由于作者掌握了一个矛盾的前进的一面，他掌握了整个矛盾，由于他深入到了新旧人物的灵魂里，他才掌握住了这个矛盾的历史的本质，而同时也由于作者掌握了这个矛盾的历史的本质，才给了新旧人物以真实的生命，这种人物和矛盾之间的结合关系，提供了典型性格和典型环境之间的结合关系的一个很好的例子。只有这样的作品才给了读者以丰富的思想力量，而同时也只有这样深入的人物典型，这样在农村中不知重复了几千万遍的日常生活的本质的揭露，才能在读者间引起普遍的教育效果。而自然这首先要求作者的严肃的创作态度，深刻地理解创作的现实主义才有可能，才可能到达。
    那末《传家宝》中已经完全没有缺点了吗，那也不是的，《传家宝》中有着一个比较严重的缺点：这个缺点就是我们新的一代对老的一代的态度问题；在《传家宝》中，小娥的丈夫是作为金桂的领导者和支持者而出现的，他在金桂和婆婆的争论中，一次说：“老人家！依我说，你只用好吃上些好穿上些，过几年清净日子算了，家里的事，你不用管它！”又一次说：“老人家！不是说你不该管，是说你上了年纪了，如今的新事情你有些摸不着！管不了！”最后，婆婆赌气认了输以后，他哈哈大笑起来说：“我原来不是叫你‘过几年清净日子算了’吗？”这些话作为一种世俗的套语，自然是会有的，但，把它放在这里，就形成了这样一种观念：就是把老一代安排在新生活秩序以外，而不是引向新的生活秩序以内来解决婆媳矛盾，如果从一个贫农阶享家庭来说，老一代妇女，不论级过去，还是今天，可以坐起来享清福的例子是很少有的。其次，领导权真正的意义，在新社会和旧社会里也有本质的不同，对新人物和旧人物来说也有不同，对婆婆来说，管账问题是一个当家或领导权问题，对金桂来说，领导权主要的意义应该不在这里：小说中小娥丈夫曾说：“……我看就叫金桂把家务交代给老人家也好，老人家管住家务，金桂清净一点，倒还能多做一点活！”假使真的能够这样，这不止是“也好”，而且是“很好”的事情，婆媳的矛盾如果沿着这个方向来解决，只有把婆婆引向新的生活秩序里来，而如果引进来了，只有对金桂的领导权更加确定的可能。而如果，婆婆真的进入新的秩序里来，而且显得很进步，那末，领导权即使让给婆婆，这又有什么不好呢？应该指出，今天解放区农村里，贫农阶级中有了阶级觉悟，参加了生产劳动的婆婆是大有人在的。希望这对于作者赵树理，不致会被看作是一种苛求。
                                        一九四九，十二月，十五日。
