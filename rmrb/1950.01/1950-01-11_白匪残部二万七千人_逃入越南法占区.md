    Remnants of 27,000 White Bandits
    Flee into French-Occupied Zone of Vietnam
    The French claim that these bandit troops have been disarmed is a lie to cover up their conspiracy to collude with the Kuomintang remnants to attack the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th】27,000 remnants of the White bandits have fled from Guangxi into the French-occupied zone of Vietnam. These defeated bandits, seeking imperialist protection, entered the French-controlled areas of Gaoping, Nanguan, Tongdeng, Liangshan, Zhihuang, and Leping in southwestern Guangxi from the 14th to the 28th of last month. This included the remnants of the Bandit 1st Army Corps and the Bandit 176th Division, Security 1st Regiment, Security 3rd Regiment, Independent 7th Regiment, and the remnants of the Guilin Pacification Headquarters Garrison Battalion. In addition, some Kuomintang reactionary government officials and bandit family members also fled with them. According to French officials, these bandit troops have been disarmed and detained. The French government guarantees that it will never return these disarmed deserters to the Kuomintang leaders for disposal, nor will it incorporate all or part of these deserters into the French army or the Bao Dai army under any name. However, according to news from the Guangxi-Vietnam border, the French side has concentrated some of the bandit troops in the Xian'an and Jin'ao areas along the Vietnamese coast, and is gradually sending them to Hainan Island to be handed over to the Kuomintang bandit leaders to continue the civil war against the Chinese people. Many Kuomintang officials left Vietnam on three large ships that arrived in Xian'an from Hainan Island on the 17th of last month. A portion of the bandit troops have been secretly incorporated into the French colonial army and Bao Dai troops stationed in Liangshan, Lupi, and Anzhou. Some Kuomintang secret agents have been used to disrupt the rear of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Another part was sent to Hongji to work as miners. Furthermore, more than 1,000 troops of the Bandit 176th Division, who had already fled into the French-occupied zone of Vietnam, sneaked back to harass the vicinity of Longzhou via Shuikouguan on the 29th of last month. According to a dispatch from Agence France-Presse in Hanoi on the 29th, a spokesman for the French Commissioner's Office in Hanoi told reporters: "The disarming of the Chinese refugee army detachment has been carried out under normal circumstances, with the exception of more than 2,000 people, whom Wu Hongqing claims to be the commander." Wu Hongqing is a member of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party who has long colluded with the White bandit Chongxi. The White bandits had decided long ago that when the bandit troops fled into the French-occupied zone of Vietnam, they would disguise themselves as "Vietnamese Volunteer Army" and be commanded by Wu Hongqing. According to a telegram from Wu Hongqing to Bao Dai published by the White bandits in Hainan Island last month: "I have organized the Xingguo Army with my original subordinates near the border. With your assistance and guidance, we will definitely fight against the communists led by Ho Chi Minh." The so-called "Xingguo Army" here is obviously a disguise for Bai Chongxi's bandit troops who entered Vietnam. In view of the above facts, people here are extremely skeptical of the French government's promises and believe that the French side's promises are intended to deceive the Chinese people and the people of the world, and to cover up its conspiracy to collude with the Kuomintang bandit gang and use the White bandit remnants to attack the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army.

### 白匪残部二万七千人  逃入越南法占区

    白匪残部二万七千人
    逃入越南法占区
    法方所称该项匪军已予解除武装等谎言，是为了掩盖与国民党残匪勾结打击越南人民解放军的阴谋。
    【新华社北京十日电】白匪残部二万七千人已由广西逃入越南法国占领区。这些寻求帝国主义保护的溃匪，是在上月十四日至二十八日，先后由广西西南部的隘店、水口关进入法方控制的高平、南关、同登、谅山、支黄、乐平等地。其中包括匪一兵团残部及匪一七六师、保一团、保三团、独七团和桂林绥署警备营残部。此外，尚有一部分国民党反动政府的机关工作人员和匪军家属等亦随同逃往。据法国官方表示：这些匪军均已被解除武装，并已予以拘禁。法国政府保证决不将这些已解除武装的逃兵，交回给国民党的首领们处置，也不会将这些逃兵的全部或一部以任何名义编入法国军队或保大军队。但据来自桂越边界的消息，法方已将匪军的一部分集中越南沿海的先安、锦镐化一带，陆续送往海南岛，交给国民党匪帮首领，继续进行反对中国人民的内战。其中有不少国民党官员系于上月十七日自先安搭乘由海南岛开来的大轮船三艘离开越南。一部分匪军已被秘密编入驻谅山、陆平、安州的法殖民军和保大部队。一部分国民党特务分子已被使用以捣乱越南人民共和国的后方。另一部分则被派至鸿基当矿工。而已经逃入越境法占区的匪军一七六师一千余人，又于上月二十九日经水口关窜回龙州附近骚扰。又据法国新闻社河内二十九日电，法驻河内专员公署的发言人告记者称：“解除中国避难军分遣队的武装已在正常情况下进行，但有二千余人除外，武鸿卿声称他是这二千余人的司令”按武鸿卿为越南国民党人，与白匪崇禧勾结已久。白匪很早以前即已决定，在匪军逃入越南法占区时，化装为“越南志愿军”，由武鸿卿出面指挥。据白匪上月在海南岛所发表的武鸿卿给保大的电报说：“我已和边界附近原有部属组织了兴国军，在你的协助指导下，一定和胡志明领导的共产党作战。”这里所谓“兴国军”显然是入越的白崇禧匪部的伪装。鉴于上述事实，此间人士对于法国政府的诺言已极端怀疑，并认为法方的此种诺言，旨在欺骗中国人民和世界人民，掩盖其与国民党匪帮勾结，利用白匪残部打击越南人民解放军的阴谋。
