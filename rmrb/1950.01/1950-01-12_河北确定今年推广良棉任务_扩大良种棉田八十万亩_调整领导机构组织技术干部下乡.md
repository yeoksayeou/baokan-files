    Hebei Determines This Year's Task of Promoting High-Quality Cotton
    Expanding High-Quality Cotton Fields by 800,000 Mu
    Adjusting Leadership Structures, Organizing Technical Cadres to Go to the Countryside
    [Our Newspaper] In order to promote high-quality cotton, increase cotton production, and ensure industrial raw materials, the Hebei Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture convened a meeting of directors of high-quality cotton guidance zones and cotton ginning factory directors on December 25th of last year, and formulated a preliminary plan for the promotion of high-quality cotton in 1950. The meeting determined that in 1950, the planting area of high-quality cotton (No. 2 and No. 4) should be expanded by 800,000 mu. Because the seeds are mixed, new promotion areas will not be opened up in 1950 for the time being, but the focus will be on expanding the promotion on the basis of the original promotion areas. By launching mass seed selection work, the purity should be increased to 80 percent. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu should be 28 jin. Within five years, all cotton fields in the province will be converted to high-quality varieties.

    Regarding promotion methods: 1. Emphasize centralized promotion: both the scope of the area and the planting area should be concentrated. Each guidance zone should have key counties. All villages that planted high-quality cotton in 1949 should be required to plant high-quality varieties through persuasion and organizational work, and expand outwards from this as a base. Designate villages as high-quality seed breeding and management areas. 2. Strictly manage to improve purity: In addition to educating farmers to screen seeds and remove mixed seeds before sowing, emphasize not mixing other varieties. If there are missing seedlings, other food crops can be replanted. During the autumn harvest, in conjunction with high-price purchases, vigorously promote the selection and separate harvesting of high-quality cotton. 3. In order to master a large number of high-quality seeds and lay the foundation for expanding promotion in 1951, make appointments with farmers during the promotion, allowing the guidance zone to still purchase seed cotton at a high price after the autumn. 4. In general, old promotion households in base villages will not be loaned new seeds. In new households and new villages, in addition to organizing farmers to adjust themselves, the provincial government may appropriately loan a part based on the plan. 5. All seed loans, drug loans, technical guidance, and seed cotton purchases should rely on village supply and marketing cooperatives as much as possible.

    In order to strengthen leadership and ensure the completion of tasks, the meeting clearly stipulated that the key task of each "Cotton Production Improvement Guidance Zone" is to master the promotion and management of high-quality cotton, and to bring technology to the countryside. However, for general cotton fields, opinions on technical guidance must also be submitted to the leadership in a timely manner in order to achieve a universal increase in unit yield. Appropriate adjustments will also be made to the leadership structure. The existing guidance zones and cotton ginning factories in the same area will be merged into special district cotton production improvement guidance zones, with promotion guidance sections and processing and purification sections. Each guidance zone should be under the dual leadership of the provincial government and the special commissioner's office. Strengthen ties with local farms, supply and marketing cooperatives, and cotton yarn and cloth companies in order to enhance work strength under unified steps.

    In order to ensure the completion of the plan, the meeting decided to complete some necessary preparations before spring sowing. The first is seeds. Each guidance zone must complete ginning and screening and conduct germination tests before the Rain Water solar term to improve purity and ensure germination rate. Secondly, through local production meetings at all levels, the task of planting high-quality cotton should be arranged to the planned promotion villages in the overall production work arrangement, and in-depth rural propaganda and mobilization should be carried out to persuade farmers in the good management area to completely plant No. 2 or No. 4 cotton.

    With the existing active farmers and model workers as the core, establish a high-quality cotton promotion and management committee (if the village has technical groups or supply and marketing cooperatives and other production organizations, try to combine them and no longer establish them separately), which will become a grassroots organization for cotton production improvement work under the unified leadership of the village production committee. Help the village formulate a cotton planting plan and complete cotton field statistics as a basis for seed allocation.

    河北确定今年推广良棉任务
    扩大良种棉田八十万亩
    调整领导机构组织技术干部下乡
    【本报讯】河北省人民政府农业厅为推广良棉，增加棉产，保证工业原料，特于去年十二月二十五日召开良棉指导区主任与轧花厂长会议，制定了一九五○年良棉推广初步计划。会议确定了一九五○年要求扩大种植良棉八十万亩（二号及四号）。因为种籽混杂，所以一九五○年暂不开辟新推广地区，而着重在原推广区的推广基础上扩大推广，并通过发动群众选种工作，要求把纯度提高到百分之八十。每亩产皮棉平均二十八斤。并在五年内把全省棉田都改为良种。
    在推广方法上：１、强调集中推广：无论地区范围及播种面积，都要求集中。各指导区要有重点县。凡在一九四九年种良棉村庄，通过说服及组织工作，要求全部种植良种棉，并以此为基点向外扩张。划定村庄作为良种繁殖管理区。２、严格管理提高纯度：除教育农民在播种前筛籽检籽清除杂籽外，并强调不混种其他品种，如有缺苗可补种其他粮食作物。秋收时结合高价收购，大力推广选良分收工作。３、为大量掌握良种，打下一九五一年扩大推广的基础，推广时向农民进行预约，允许秋后仍由指导区进行籽棉的高价收购。４、凡基点村之旧推广户一般不贷发新种，新户新村除通过组织农民自行调剂外，省府可根据计划适当贷发一部。５、所有贷种、贷药、技术指导及籽棉收购，尽量依靠村供销社。
    为加强领导，保证任务完成，会上明确规定各“棉产改进指导区”的任务重点是掌握良棉推广与管理，作到技术下乡。但对一般棉田也必须及时向领导提出技术指导的意见，以达到单位产量的普遍提高。在领导机构上也予以适当调整。现有的各同一区内的指导区、轧花厂，实行合并，为专区棉产改进指导区，下设推广指导股及加工保纯等股。各指导区应受省府及专署双重领导。并加强与当地农场、供销社及花纱布公司之联系。以便在统一步骤之下增强工作力量。
    为保证计划的完成，会议决定春季播种前完成一些必要的准备工作。首先是种籽，各指导区要在雨水节前完成轧籽筛籽并作发芽试验，以提高纯度和保证发芽率。其次通过当地各级生产会议，在整个生产工作的布置中，把种植良棉的任务布置到预定的推广村庄，并应深入农村进行宣传动员，说服良管区农民完全种二号或四号棉。
    以现有的积极农民和英模能手为核心，建立良棉推广管理委员会（如村有技术组或供销社等生产组织，就尽量结合他们，不再单独建立），在村生产委员会统一领导下成为棉产改进工作的基层组织。帮助村作出植棉计划，完成棉田统计，作为种籽调剂的根据。
