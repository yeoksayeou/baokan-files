Xinhua News Agency, North China, 23rd – Land reform movements in the newly liberated areas of North China are now unfolding steadily. Except for Suiyuan Province, where land reform is temporarily not being carried out, the other four provinces in North China—Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, and Pingyuan—with a population of over ten million in the new areas (including the recovery areas), successively began land reform work last winter. In the new areas of Shanxi, land reform is underway in more than 1,700 villages, among which 81 villages, where key experiments began last November, have now basically concluded. The first batch of over 400 villages has largely entered the stage of confiscating landlords' land and property and requisitioning rich peasants' surplus land and property. In the new areas of Hebei, among the more than 4,000 villages, land reform is being carried out in approximately 1,000 villages, excluding some severely disaster-stricken areas where all efforts are focused on production and disaster relief, with a small number of villages having already completed land distribution. In the new areas of Chahar Province, consisting of over 2,000 villages, the land reform movement is expanding from key points to a comprehensive scale. In the new areas of Pingyuan, land reform work began in November of last year in over 6,000 villages, and some villages have already completed it. In addition, land reform work is underway in the suburbs of Beijing, Tianjin, and Taiyuan.

Before the start of land reform, various regions carried out relatively full preparations. Since October of last year, the provinces have successively convened cadre meetings and training classes to extensively train cadres at the county, district, and village levels who are participating in the land reform work. In Hebei's Tongxian, Baoding, and Tangshan special districts alone, over 13,000 cadres participated in land reform meetings in early November. Through repeated discussions at these meetings and training classes, the cadres understood the land reform policies for the new areas and the working methods for implementing these policies. In addition, various regions have universally discussed land reform policies and decided on land reform plans through people's representative conferences and peasant representative conferences. At the People's Representative Conference in Tongxian, Hebei, discussions were held on what is meant by "stabilizing the middle and leveling the two ends." The representatives clearly recognized the policy of protecting middle peasants (including well-to-do middle peasants) and the benefits of not touching landlords' and rich peasants' oil mills, flour mills, and shops for the development of production. In the new areas of Chahar Province, the policies of land reform were universally discussed through people's representative conferences and CCP member representative conferences in various counties, thus stabilizing the sentiments of people of all strata and relieving the broad masses of middle peasants of their concerns, allowing them to engage in production without reservation.

In order to strengthen leadership over land reform work, provinces such as Chahar and Shanxi have dispatched cadres to form work teams or inspection teams to go to the countryside to help promote land reform work and promptly report situations and problems to higher levels. Chahar Province has sent out three land reform work teams and decided to focus on Wanquan County as a key area to create experience in order to further promote the land reform movement throughout the province.

After the start of land reform, the leading organs have paid more attention to the correct implementation of policies, and new innovations have also emerged in working methods. Many regions have been very cautious in classifying class status, allowing the masses to grasp the criteria for classifying class status, engaging in repeated discussions, and allowing for the submission of appeals if there are objections, truly achieving "three public postings to finalize the case." In addition, various regions have also stipulated strict reporting systems, clearly specifying what can be done and what cannot be done, so that land reform work can advance steadily according to policy. Higher-level leading organs have paid attention to correcting some deviations that have occurred in individual places during land reform work in a timely manner. For example, in Lulong County, Hebei, an error occurred in the work of universally implementing the "sweeping out of the house" method for landlords. After the provincial leading organ learned about it, it immediately inspected and stopped its actions, and transferred the land reform work cadres back for further training, explaining the policies and redeploying the land reform work in the county. The leading organs of some provinces immediately notified the entire province of the errors that occurred in various regions.

In addition, all regions have paid attention to making land reform revolve around production. The Peasant Representative Conference of Dongquan Village, Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, studied the method of combining land reform with production, eliminating the concerns of some peasants who feared delaying work and waiting for land reform instead of engaging in production. Many cadres in Chahar Province understood the situation and publicized the land reform policy while mobilizing and organizing the masses to engage in production, gradually developing the land reform work. In order to increase peasants' enthusiasm for production, land ownership certificates have been quickly issued in some villages where land reform work has been completed.

    按照政策稳步前进
    华北新区土改开展
    充分准备，掌握政策，纠正偏向，结合生产，是工作顺利进行的保证。
    【新华社华北二十三日电】华北新区土地改革运动现正稳步开展中。华北五省除绥远暂不进行土地改革外，其他河北、察哈尔、山西、平原等四省约一千余万人口的新区（包括恢复区），于去冬先后开始进行土地改革工作。山西新区有一千七百余村进行土地改革，其中于去冬十一月开始作为重点实验的八十一个村子，现已基本结束。首批四百余村的土地改革运动，大部已进入没收地主土地、财产和征收富农多余土地、财产的阶段。河北新区四千余村，除部分灾情严重地区全力进行生产救灾外，进行土地改革的约有千余村，其中少数村庄已分配完土地。察省新区二千余村，土地改革运动正由基点向全面扩展。平原新区六千余村去年十一月即开始进行土地改革工作，现部分村庄已经完成。此外，北京、天津及太原市郊的土地改革工作正在进行中。
    土地改革开始前，各地都进行了较充分的准备工作。自去年十月份起，各省即先后召开干部会和训练班，普遍训练了参加土地改革工作的县、区、村三级干部。仅河北的通县、保定、唐山三个专区，十一月上旬参加土地改革会议的干部即达一万三千余人。经过这些会议与训练班的反复讨论，使干部了解了新区土地改革政策和执行这些政策的工作方法。另外，各地又普遍经过各界代表会议、农民代表会讨论土地改革政策，议定土地改革方案。河北通县各界人民代表会上，讨论了什么叫“中间不动两头平”代表们明确地认识了必须保护中农（包括富裕中农在内）的政策和不动地主、富农的油房、粉房、店铺等工商业对发展生产的好处。察省新区各县普遍经过各界代表会和中共党员代表会讨论了土地改革的政策，因而安定了各阶层人民情绪，使广大中农解除顾虑放手生产。
    为加强对土地改革工作的领导，察哈尔、山西等省都抽调干部组成工作组或检查组下乡，帮助推进土地改革工作，并及时向上反映情况和问题。察哈尔省派出了三个土改工作组，并决定以万全县为工作重点，创造经验，以便把全省的土地改革运动推进一步。
    在土地改革开始后，领导机关多注意政策的正确贯彻，工作方法上亦有新的创造。不少地区在划阶级中十分慎重，让群众掌握划阶级的标准，反复讨论，有意见允许提出申辩，真正做到“三榜定案”。此外各地又都规定了严格的请示报告制度，明白规定那些事可以做，那些事不可以做，使土地改革工作按照政策稳步前进。对于个别地方在土地改革工作中发生的一些偏差，高级领导机关均及时注意纠正。如河北卢龙县在工作中曾发生对地主普遍实行“扫地出门”办法的错误，省的领导机关知道以后，立即检查停止其行动，并把土地改革工作干部调回再加训练，讲清政策，重新布置该县的土地改革工作。有些省的领导机关，并将各地区发生的错误，立即通报全省。
    此外，各地都注意使土地改革围绕着生产进行。山西省平遥县东泉村农民代表会，研究了土地改革与生产结合的办法，消除了有些农民怕误工及等待土地改革不去生产的思想。察省许多干部在动员和组织群众进行生产中了解情况和宣传土地改革政策，使土地改革工作逐步开展。为提高农民生产情绪，有些土地改革工作已完成的村庄都迅速发了土地证。
