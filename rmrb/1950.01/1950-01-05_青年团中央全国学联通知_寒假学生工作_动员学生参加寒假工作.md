The participants shall be determined by the local Youth League and student federations according to the specific circumstances. The content of study or discussion should focus on summarizing work experiences and lessons learned and planning work for the next semester in the old areas. In the new areas, the focus should be on transforming ideology and establishing a revolutionary outlook on life. During the learning process, attention should be paid to building the Youth League.

    【新华社北京四日电】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会和中华全国学生联合会于本月一日发出关于寒假学生工作的通知。通知全文如下：
    （一）寒假快要来到了。这是中华人民共和国成立和全国大城市全部解放以后的第一个寒假。各地青年团和学联应该充分地利用这段时间，组织起广大的学生来学习革命理论和政策，参加政府号召的各项工作，使学生在这些实际工作中，受到锻炼；此外并应组织学生进行各种文化、娱乐、体育活动或温习功课。学生工作干部则应当趁此时机总结工作经验，提高工作水平，为下学期开展新民主主义的学习，打下更好的基础。
    （二）由于新区和老区的情况和具体任务不同，学生的思想水平、学校的性质和寒假时间的长短也都有差别，各地青年团和学联应当根据当地具体条件，布置适合于自己情况的寒假工作。兹提出以下几项工作，供你们选择和参考：
    第一、设立青年学园，定期举办青年讲座。其内容可着重讲解中国人民政协共同纲领和新民主主义政策，或唯物史观的基本问题，或中国近三十年历史和中华全国学生第十四届代表大会的决议等。和讲座相配合，可以组织座谈会、辩论会或小组讨论；也可以组织各科的学习互助组，在教师帮助下，补习功课。此外，应采取生动活泼的方式，举办电影、戏剧、娱乐晚会和冬令体育活动等。
    第二、举办短期训练班，或召开学校工作会议。参加人员，由当地青年团和学联根据具体情况规定之。学习或讨论的内容，在老区应着重总结工作经验教训，计划下学期工作。在新区应着重改造思想，建立革命的人生观。在学习过程中，要注意进行建团工作。
    第三、积极响应中央人民政府文化部、教育部十二月二十一日公布的“关于开展年节、春节群众宣传工作和文艺工作的指示”的号召，组织宣传队，结合春节文娱活动，用多种多样的方式广泛地向人民进行宣传指示中所提的要点，如中国人民政协共同纲领、国际主义等。在这些实际活动中，对广大学生进行政策思想教育，来提高他们的政治认识。
    第四、根据当地具体情况，进行各种社会服务工作，如慰劳人民解放军和军人家属，帮助工人、农民开展春节文娱活动，协助政府开展农村冬学运动等。同时要虚心地向工人农民学习勤劳的作风，进一步加强与工农结合、为工农服务的思想。
    （三）各地青年团和学联接到通知后，应即着手准备，拟定具体计划，并联络学校行政方面和教师，把同学们很好地动员起来参加寒假工作。在筹备和进行工作时，应当取得人民政府的教育部门的有力帮助和指导。
    （四）各地青年团和学联在寒假结束后，请将工作报告和经验总结寄给我们。
