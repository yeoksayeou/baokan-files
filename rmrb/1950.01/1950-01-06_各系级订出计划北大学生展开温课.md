Departments and Grades Formulate Plans for Peking University Students to Unfold Reviewing

    [Beijing News] Various departments and grades of Peking University have successively formulated review plans to unfold reviewing as the focus of implementing the resolutions of the teacher-student representative meeting. The Peking University School Affairs Committee issued a bulletin last week, calling on all students to start reviewing from now on, and pointed out, according to the resolutions of the teacher-student representative meeting: (1) Clarify that the purpose of reviewing is not to cope with exams, but to make learning more in-depth; (2) The reviewing work should be carried out jointly by teachers and students; (3) Reviewing must be planned, step-by-step, and focused. When formulating review plans, students in various departments generally do so with the help and guidance of teachers; teachers formulate review outlines and point out key points, and each learning mutual aid group formulates plans based on the review outlines. The learning method is: each mutual aid group focuses on self-study, supplemented by collective discussion. Problems that cannot be solved by each mutual aid group are collected and sorted out by the class leaders of each course and submitted to the teachers for answers. The department and grade committees are responsible for checking the reviewing situation of each group to ensure the implementation of the review plan. Now the learning mutual aid groups of various departments and grades have started reviewing according to the formulated plans. (Peking University Communications Group)
