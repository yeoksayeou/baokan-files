(Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 14th) Henan Province has victoriously completed its autumn grain collection work. Most areas are now stepping up the storage of grain, with only a very few places continuing to clear up remaining arrears.

In October of last year, after the Second Financial and Economic Conference of the Henan Provincial People's Government determined the task of collecting autumn public grain, each special commissioner's office convened meetings of cadres from its subordinate counties. Following this, each county and district held universal meetings of farmer representatives. In twenty-three counties and cities where mass work already had a considerable foundation, meetings of people's representatives from all circles focused on discussing autumn grain collection. Responsible government officials in various localities repeatedly explained the significant importance of this year's grain collection and publicized and interpreted various collection policies to the representatives attending these meetings. On the other hand, they reviewed certain shortcomings in the summer grain collection work, humbly listened to the representatives' criticisms of past work, and through democratic discussion at the meetings, fairly distributed the burden tasks among various localities. This not only educated the broad masses but also educated cadres at all levels. For example, when distributing the autumn collection tasks, some cadres and masses, emphasizing the heavy burden due to successive disasters such as floods, droughts, winds, and hail this year, expressed one-sided views. However, after democratic discussion at the meetings, everyone specifically studied the situation in various regions and compared the people's government's taxes with those of the Kuomintang. This one-sided thinking was quickly resolved, and everyone voluntarily pledged to victoriously complete the task. Some representatives from non-disaster areas even voluntarily requested to increase their tasks to take care of the people in neighboring disaster areas, further strengthening the close unity among farmers. At the same time, the people's government also systematically carried out appropriate adjustments between disaster and non-disaster areas, reducing and exempting more than 12 million catties of public grain for areas in the province that were severely affected by disasters. In addition, agricultural specialty areas were allowed to pay public grain in kind with cotton, homespun cloth, peanuts, tobacco leaves, sesame, etc., calculated in millet units, with the conversion rate generally 5% to 10% higher than the market price.

After the public grain tasks were assigned, the district and township governments, together with people's representatives from all walks of life, launched extensive propaganda campaigns. Through township and village farmer representative meetings or village meetings, they democratically elected grain collection appraisal committees, which, in coordination with the farmers' associations, conducted democratic appraisals in accordance with reasonable burden policies. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to oppose the landlord class's practice of transferring the burden of public grain to the farmers by concealing land. Combining this with local efforts to clear out bandits and oppose local bullies, a mass movement to squeeze out hidden land was created. For example, the Luoyang Special District squeezed out more than 367,000 mu of hidden land. The hidden land squeezed out in the Huangchuan Special District accounted for about 30% of the originally reported land area. After squeezing out a large amount of the landlords' hidden land, the burden on farmers in general villages could be reduced by about 20%, and in some areas, it even reached 40%. Therefore, the enthusiasm of farmers across the province for handing in grain was extremely high. The province completed 80% of the autumn collection task within ten days in late November, and by mid-December, the province had completed an average of 97.4%.

At the beginning of the autumn grain collection, the Henan Provincial People's Government proposed the policy of emphasizing both collection and storage, regarding the construction of warehouses as an important task in the autumn collection work. As a small number of areas did not pay enough attention to this extremely important task, the Provincial People's Government conducted a general inspection of public grain warehouses in various localities. The inspection revealed that the public grain that was mildewed, damaged, or wasted due to negligent storage, corruption, and waste in the Huaiyang, Shangqiu, Nanyang, and other special districts alone amounted to more than 2 million catties. For this serious phenomenon, in addition to ordering relevant agencies in various localities to conduct profound self-criticism and formulate future improvement measures, the Provincial People's Government also imposed disciplinary sanctions on those derelict of duty based on the specific circumstances. After the Zhu Ji warehouse directly under the Shangqiu Special Commissioner's Office was set on fire by special agents, the Provincial Government promulgated a decision on armed warehouse protection. In order to prevent sabotage by Kuomintang reactionaries, special agents, and bandits, farmers in many areas spontaneously organized joint defense teams or warehouse protection groups.

    经各界人民代表会公平分配
    河南胜利完成秋征
    通过民主评议、挤黑地，农民负担减轻
    【新华社开封十四日电】河南省秋季征粮工作已胜利完成。现大部地区正加紧屯粮入仓，只有极少数地方还在继续扫清征粮尾欠。
    去年十月间，在河南省人民政府第二次财经会议确定了征收秋季公粮的任务后，各专署即召开了所属各县的干部会议，各个县、区跟着又普遍举行了县、区农民代表会议，其中群众工作已有相当基础的二十三个县、市并在各界人民代表会议上，着重讨论了秋征工作。各地政府负责人在各界代表会和农民代表会上，一面向与会代表反复说明今年征粮的重大意义，宣传解释各项征收政策；另一方面检讨了夏征工作中的某些缺点，虚心听取了代表们对过去工作的批评。各地并在会上经民主讨论公平地分配了各地负担任务。这样不但教育了广大群众，并且教育了各级的工作干部。譬如当分配秋征任务时，曾有部分干部和群众以今年连遭水旱风雹等灾害，片面强调负担任务重，但经会议民主讨论，大家具体研究了各地情况，并把人民政府的税收和国民党的税收比较以后，这种片面的思想便很快打通了，大家都自动提出保证胜利完成任务，有些非灾区代表更自愿要求增加任务，以照顾邻近灾区的人民，进一步加强了农民之间的亲密团结。与此同时，人民政府也有计划地进行了灾区与非灾区之间的适当调剂，对全省受灾较重地区减免了一千二百余万斤公粮。此外并允许农业特产区以出产之棉花、土布、花生、烟叶、芝麻等，按小米为单位折交公粮，其折算标准一般高于市价百分之五至百分之十。
    当公粮任务分配下去之后，各地区、乡政府即与各界人民代表展开了广泛的宣传运动，并通过乡、村农民代表会或村民大会，民主选出了征粮评议委员会，在农民协会配合下，依照合理负担政策进行民主评议。同时发动群众反对地主阶级转嫁公粮负担于农民的瞒田行为，结合当地清匪反恶霸运动，造成一个群众性的挤黑地斗争。如洛阳专区即挤出黑地三十六万七千余亩。潢川专区挤出的黑地约占原报土地数量的百分之三十。将地主的大批黑地挤出后，一般村庄的农民负担可减轻百分之二十左右，部分地区且达百分之四十。因此，全省农民的缴粮情绪极高。全省在十一月下旬十天内即完成了秋征任务的百分之八十，至十二月中旬，全省平均已完成了百分之九十七·四。
    在秋征开始时，河南省人民政府即提出征收与保管并重的方针，把建设仓库作为秋征工作中的一项重要任务。由于少数地区对这个极其重要的任务不重视，省人民政府特对各地公粮仓库进行了普遍检查。检查中发现仅淮阳、商邱、南阳等专区因保管不慎致霉烂损坏及贪污浪费的公粮，竟达二百余万斤。对于这种严重现象，除由省人民政府通令各地有关机关进行深刻检讨并订出今后改进办法外，并根据具体情况分别予各渎职人员以法纪处分。在商邱专署直属之朱集仓库为特务分子纵火焚毁后，省府并颁布了武装护仓的决定。不少地区的农民为了防止国民党反动派特务、土匪分子的破坏行为，自动组织了联防队或护仓小组。
