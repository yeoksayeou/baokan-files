    Saving is not a short-term crash campaign!
    Peking University promotes regular conservation.
    Water, electricity, and coal consumption greatly reduced in December.
    [Our Newspaper] Peking University is carrying out regular conservation work, and preliminary results have been achieved since December of last year. The university launched a conservation campaign in April, May, and June of last year, achieving significant results. Monthly consumption of electricity, water, and coal gradually decreased. However, starting in August, consumption gradually increased again, with the consumption in some places in October even reaching more than double that of August. The reason for this is that many people regard conservation as merely a short-term campaign. Once the peak of the campaign passed, everyone relaxed. In order to correct the phenomenon of waste and persist in regular conservation, the Peking University School Committee, Student Union, Faculty and Staff Union, and Labor-Police Union jointly formed a "Conservation Movement Committee" in early November. This committee systematically and comprehensively promoted conservation work, starting from ideological awareness. They organized political study groups to conduct criticism and self-criticism in light of specific circumstances, fully mobilized people, and engaged in in-depth discussions. The Student Union's Shantan Branch even put forward specific suggestions, pointing out instances of waste in electricity, water, and coal, and called on students to correct these issues through competitive methods. After the campaign began, each group actively expressed their commitment through actions, ensuring regular and thorough implementation. Workers managing the stoves paid attention to saving coal, and students paid attention to saving electricity and water. The entire fourth-year class of the Law Department made sure to turn off the lights at 11 p.m. and go to bed early and rise early, taking the lead. Now, all the students in the Shantan area have been able to change their past habit of going to bed too late at night, not only saving electricity but also improving study efficiency. The dormitories of the Law Department fourth-year class originally had twenty-six light bulbs, totaling one thousand and five candlepower. After reasonable adjustments, this was reduced to sixteen light bulbs, four hundred candlepower. In October, the average water consumption per person in the Third Courtyard was two tons. Since November, mutual supervision has been implemented to ensure that face washing does not exceed half a basin of water. Bathing time has also been reduced to only three days a week according to the actual situation. The Physics and Chemistry departments also proposed to take good care of instruments and save on reagents.
    According to recent statistics from the General Affairs Group, the consumption of electricity, water, and coal in the Shantan area in December all decreased generally compared to the previous period. Electricity consumption decreased by 1225 kWh compared to November; water consumption decreased by 597 tons; and coal consumption decreased by 16,050 catties, marking a good start for regular conservation.

    节约不是短期突击工作！
    北大推行经常性节约     
    十二月份水电煤用量大减
    【本报讯】北京大学开展经常性的节约工作，去年十二月份起已获初步成绩。该校在去年四、五、六三个月中，曾开展过节约运动，获得显著成绩，每月电、水、煤用量逐渐降低，但自八月份开始，又逐渐上升，若干处所十月份的用量竟达到八月份的一倍以上，原因是有许多人把节约看作只是一个短时期的运动。运动的高潮一过，大家都放松了。为了纠正浪费现象，坚持经常的节约，十一月初北大校委会、学生会、教职员联合会和工警工会又组成“节约运动委员会”，有组织地全面地从思想上着手来推动节约工作，组织各政治课学习小组结合具体情况，展开批评与自我批评，充分动员，深入讨论。学生会沙滩区分会更提出具体建议，指出电、水、煤方面的浪费事实，号召同学用竞赛方法进行纠正。运动开始后，各小组都能积极地以行动表示，保证经常彻底地执行。管理炉火的工人注意节煤，同学注意节电省水。法律系四年级全班同学做到晚上十一点熄灯，早起早睡，起了带头作用。现在全沙滩区同学都能改变过去夜里睡觉过迟的习惯，不独省了电，而且提高学习效率。法四同学的寝室中本有二十六个灯泡，计一千零五支烛光，经合理调整后，减少到十六个灯泡，四百支烛光。三院十月份平均每人用水二吨，十一月份起实行互相监督，保证洗脸不超过半盆水。洗澡时间也按照实际情况减少到每周只开放三天。物理系和化学系也提出爱护仪器，节省药品。
    最近据事务组统计，沙滩区十二月份电、水、煤三项用量均较前普遍降低，比十一月份用电减少一二二五度；用水减少五九七吨；用煤减少一六、○五○斤，为经常性的节约作了好的开端。
