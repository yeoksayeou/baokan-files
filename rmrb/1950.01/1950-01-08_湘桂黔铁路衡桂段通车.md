Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th—The Hengyang-Guilin section of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway officially reopened to traffic on December 31st of last year. The section is 360 kilometers long. When the Bai Chongxi bandit troops collapsed in October of last year, they completely destroyed the 38 main bridges along the line. The repair work began on December 4th of last year, undertaken by the 3rd Detachment of the Railway Engineering Corps, the 1st and 3rd Regiments of the Central China Railway Troops, and the Hengxi Bridge Team. Apart from the very few steel towers that the Bai bandits did not have time to pull away, all the timber and most of the steel were obtained by the soldiers who braved the rain to cut down or transport them from dozens of miles away. The main tasks in the repair work, such as bridge construction, pile driving, and erecting scaffolding, were all solved by manpower. With the arduous work of all commanders, fighters, workers, Chinese engineers, and Soviet engineers who were invited to work in our country, and with the enthusiastic support of the people along the line, the entire repair project was completed in just 28 days.

    湘桂黔铁路衡桂段通车
    【新华社北京七日电】湘桂黔铁路衡阳、桂林段已于去年十二月三十一日正式修复通车。该段全长三百六十公里。去年十月间白崇禧匪部溃退时，曾将该线主要桥梁三十八座彻底破坏。修复工程系于去年十二月四日开始，由铁道兵团第三支队、华中铁道部队第一、第三团及衡西桥梁队担任。除去极少部分白匪未及拉走的钢塔外，全部木材和大部分钢材，都靠战士们冒雨到几十里外去砍伐或搬运。修复工程中的架桥、打桩、立排架等主要工作，也都依靠人力解决。在全体指战员、工人、中国的工程人员和应聘来我国工作的苏联工程师的艰苦工作和沿线人民的热烈支援下，全部修复工程在短短二十八天内即告完成。
