    The People's Government Actively Supports Organizing Production
    Over 10,000 Martyr and Military Cadre Families in Beijing
    Basically Have Their Living Problems Solved
   [Reported by this newspaper] The Beijing People's Government actively supports martyr and military cadre families in organizing production, effectively solving their living difficulties. The organized production now includes more than ten types, such as knitting socks, spinning wool, laundry, sewing, making straw ropes, bleaching cotton, non-staple food (making tofu), shaking coal balls, and printing cloth. There are a total of thirty-eight locations in the city, with more than one thousand nine hundred people participating in the work. Before August, the administrative sections of each district and the preferential treatment section of the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau were often crowded with martyr and military cadre families asking for grain, and many people held the view of completely relying on the government, and the government was in a passive position in this work. After reviewing and summarizing the work of supporting the army in August, it was determined to focus on production, widely organize military families to produce in the form of cooperatives with less capital and production that can supply the market, and first conduct in-depth and universal understanding of the economic conditions of each household, organize military family groups to promote the work, and adopt methods such as symposiums, individual talks, night schools, literacy classes, and mobilizing them to visit the districts that were set up earlier for education, and establish their view that "military family members are glorious, and labor is even more glorious." For individual families who are well-off but still want relief, they are patiently given individual persuasion and education. The source of funds mainly relies on military family relief grain, loans from banks, mobilization of the masses to cooperate in raising funds, plus military family members take out some furniture from their homes for use. In addition, according to the season, everyone is organized to produce, such as organizing winter clothing and cotton padding in winter. They also helped many people find jobs, introducing them to work in government agencies or as teachers. In the second district, 150 people found jobs. Of the more than 13,000 martyr and military cadre families in the city, except for 30 percent who have the living conditions and 7 or 8 percent of the elderly, weak, orphans, and widows who rely entirely on government relief to maintain their lives, the rest have basically solved the living problems of the city's martyr and military cadre families under the organization of production, introduction of employment, and partial government relief and assistance.

    人民政府积极扶助组织生产
    京市万余户烈军干属
    生活问题已基本解决
   【本报讯】北京人民政府积极扶助烈军干属组织生产，切实解决他们的生活困难。现已组织的生产计有织袜、纺毛、洗衣、缝纫、打草绳、漂棉、副食（做豆腐）、摇煤球、印花布等十多种。全市共三十八处，一千九百多人参加工作。八月以前，各区行政科与市府民政局优抚科，室内经常挤满烈军干属来要粮食，不少人抱着完全依赖政府的观点，政府在此项工作上陷于被动。八月检讨与总结了优军工作后，确定从生产着眼，以资金少与生产能供应市场的合作社方式，广泛组织军属生产，并首先深入普遍了解各户经济情况，组织军属小组推动工作，采取了座谈会、个别谈、夜校、识字班与发动到先办的区去参观等方法进行教育，树立他们“军属光荣、劳动更光荣”的观点。对个别家境好而还要救济的，则耐心予以个别说服教育。资金来源，主要是靠军属救济粮，向银行借贷，发动群众合作集资，再加上军属们从自己家里拿出一些家具来用。此外，还根据季节，组织大家生产，如冬季组织冬服铺棉等工作。还帮助了不少人找到了职业，介绍他们去机关工作或当教员等。二区即有一百五十人找到了职业。全市一万三千余户烈军干属，除百分之三十具备生活条件，与百分之七、八的老弱孤寡全靠政府救济维持生活外，其余在组织生产介绍职业与政府部分救济帮助下，已基本上解决了全市烈军干属们的生活。（程敏）
