    Teachers in Tong County Disaster Area Persist in Teaching Despite Hardships
    Primary School Teachers Throughout the County Prepare Grain to Support Them
    [Report from this newspaper] Hebei News: Primary school teachers in the Second District of Tong County, despite severe famine, have consistently remained at their posts, ensuring that the vast majority of elementary school children in the district have not been deprived of education due to the disaster. The district has 41 elementary schools with 50 teachers. After the flood last year, the masses faced difficult living conditions, and salaries could not be paid on time. Most teachers couldn't even afford two meals a day. However, none of them were passive or unmotivated, and they were determined to share the hardships with the people in the disaster area and teach the children of the disaster area well. Zhang Wenjiang, a teacher at Lüjiawan Elementary School, seeing the difficulties faced by the masses, has not received his full salary since August of last year and has been eating bran, vegetables, and bean curd with the people. Wang Zhiqin, a teacher at Xiaohuadian, has not received his salary for four months and sometimes only eats one meal a day, but he still manages to teach as usual, and the number of students has not decreased. The majority of teachers in the district not only persisted in elementary education but also vigorously helped the villages run winter schools and assisted village cadres in making plans for production and self-rescue. The teachers' high sense of responsibility and enthusiasm have been loved by the broad masses and cadres. For example, the cadres of Dahudian Village said: "It's really hard for us to see the teachers eating bran and vegetables. It's rare to find such hardworking teachers who teach the students even without eating. They stay up all night in cold rooms, helping us calculate accounts, draw tables, and think of ways to survive the famine. If the school is closed, not only the students will be unhappy, but we will also be reluctant to let the teachers leave us."
    Currently, initiated by Liu Jizuo and other primary school teachers from the First, Fifth, and Sixth Districts of the county, primary school teachers from non-disaster areas throughout the county are voluntarily lending one斗 (dǒu) of rice per month to the teachers in the disaster areas. In less than three days, the 150 primary school teachers throughout the county have collected more than 2,500 catties of corn. Teachers in the disaster areas can borrow 50 catties per month, starting from January until the wheat ripens. The primary school teachers have also selected representatives, bringing the first batch of grain to the Second District to express their sincere condolences to the teachers in the disaster areas.

    通县灾区教员艰苦坚持教学
    全县完小教员备粮支援
    【本报讯】河北消息：通县二区小学教员，在严重的灾荒下，始终坚持工作岗位，使全区广大小学儿童，未因灾荒影响而失学。该区共有小学四十一座，教员五十人，去年水灾后，因群众生活困难，薪金不能按时领取，多数教员每天两顿饭都吃不上；但他们中间，没有一个人消极怠工，决心和灾区群众共甘苦，教好灾区的孩子们。吕家湾小学教员张文江见群众生活困难，从去年八月起，就没领过全薪，和群众一样的吃着糠、菜、豆皮。小灰店教员王志秦，四个月没领过薪金，有时每天只吃一顿饭，仍能坚持照常上课，学生人数未减。全区多数教员，不但坚持了小学教育，并有力的帮助村里开办了冬学，帮助村干部作了生产自救计划。教员们这种高度的责任心和积极性，受到广大群众和干部的热爱。如大灰店村干部们说：“让教员们也吃糠咽菜，我们真难过，难得这样卖力气的教员，不吃饭也给学生们上课；在冰冷的屋里，一夜夜的帮助我们算账、画表、想渡荒的办法；学校停课吧，不光学生们不干，我们也舍不得让教员离开我们。”
    现该县由一、五、六区完小教员刘继佐等发起，全县非灾区完小教员，自愿每月借给灾区教员一斗米。全县一百五十个完小教员，不到三天时间，已集中了玉米两千五百多斤。灾区教员，每人每月能借五十斤，从一月开始，可以借到麦熟。完小教员们并选了代表，带着第一批粮食，到二区向灾区教员们作了亲切的慰问。
