    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: According to a Vietnam News Agency report, a portion of North African soldiers, who were driven to Vietnam by French imperialism to conduct colonial war, after being captured by the Vietnamese Liberation Army or voluntarily defecting to the Vietnamese Liberation Army, have formally formed the "North African Independent Detachment" to assist the Vietnamese Liberation Army in fighting the French army.
    The detachment recently issued a "Letter to North African Soldiers," calling on African soldiers in the French army in Vietnam to defect to the Vietnamese liberated areas in time, to avenge the five thousand North African people massacred by the French army in Constantine in July 1945 and the martyrs in this event, and the eight African soldiers massacred by the Vietnamese French colonial army last October.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: According to TASS, Paris, 14th: The movement of French working people against the Vietnam colonial war is expanding daily. According to newspaper reports, dockworkers in Marseille refused to load shells for the Italian ship "Sibylla" bound for Vietnam, preventing the ship from sailing as scheduled. Sailors on the ship "Lyon," carrying reinforcements to Vietnam, have decided to postpone departure. Six hundred dockworkers and crane operators in the port of Nantes held a meeting and unanimously supported the union's resolution to refuse to handle war materials. Due to the workers' implementation of the resolution not to transport war materials, the ship "Tissier" in the port of Le Havre could not sail as scheduled. The movement in support of the dockworkers of Saint-Nazaire refusing to unload American war materials is now spreading to many cities, including Paris and Brouen.

    越解放军“北非独立支队”发表“告北非士兵书”
    号召非洲士兵向法军作战复仇  法工人坚决拒运侵越武器
    【新华社北京十五日电】据越南通讯社消息：被法帝国主义驱至越南进行殖民地战争的北非士兵一部，自经越南解放军俘虏或自动投向越南解放军后，已正式组成“北非独立支队”，协助越南解放军向法军作战。
    该支队最近曾发表“告北非士兵书”，号召在越南法军中的非洲士兵，及时投向越南解放区，为一九四五年七月法军在康士坦丁残杀五万北非人民事件及在这事件中的殉难者、和去年十月被越南法国殖民军所残杀的八位非洲士兵报仇。
    【新华社北京十五日电】据塔斯社巴黎十四日讯：法国劳动人民反对越南殖民战争的运动，日益扩大。据报纸消息，马赛码头工人拒绝为开往越南的意大利船“锡比拉”号装载炮弹，使该轮不能如期开行。载有增援部队开往越南之“里昂”号船上的水手，已决议延期开航。南特港口六百码头工人和起重机工人集会，一致拥护工会所通过的拒绝搬运战争物资的决议。由于工人实行不装运战争物资的决议，哈佛尔港内的“蒂西勒特”号船不能如期开行。声援圣那最尔码头工人拒绝起卸美国战争物资的运动，现正扩展到许多城市，包括巴黎和布伦。
