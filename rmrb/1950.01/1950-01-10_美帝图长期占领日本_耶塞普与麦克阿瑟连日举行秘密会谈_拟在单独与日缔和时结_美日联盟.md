Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th – Jessup, the executor of the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression in the Far East and Ambassador-at-Large, arrived in Tokyo on the 5th and has held a series of secret talks with MacArthur for days. According to Jessup himself, he and MacArthur discussed the Japanese peace treaty issue and other Far Eastern issues, "including the Taiwan issue." According to a United Press report from Tokyo on the 8th, so-called "observers" believe that Jessup and MacArthur discussed the issue of concluding a "U.S.-Japan alliance" at the same time as concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan. This means that the United States will occupy Japan for a long time under the guise of a "U.S.-Japan alliance" and turn Japan into the main base for the United States to carry out aggression in the Far East. Regarding the China issue, Jessup said: "The United States has not abandoned and does not intend to abandon China or other countries in the Far East. The United States will continue to oppose the use of violence by the Communists to overthrow existing governments." This means that U.S. imperialism will continue to pursue a policy of aggression of interfering in China's internal affairs and continue to be an enemy of the Chinese people and the people of various countries in the Far East.

    美帝图长期占领日本
    耶塞普与麦克阿瑟连日举行秘密会谈     
    拟在单独与日缔和时结“美日联盟”
    【新华社北京九日电】美国远东侵略政策的执行人、无任所大使耶塞普于五日到达东京，连日与麦克阿瑟举行了一系列的秘密会谈。据耶塞普自称，他与麦克阿瑟讨论的是关于日本和约问题及远东其他问题，“包括台湾问题在内”。据合众社东京八日电，所谓“观察家”相信，耶塞普曾和麦克阿瑟谈及在缔结单独对日和约的同时，缔结“美日联盟”的问题。这就是说美国将在“美日联盟”的形式下，长期占领日本，并使日本变成美国在远东实行侵略的主要基地。关于中国问题，耶塞普说：“美国没有放弃并不拟放弃中国或远东其他国家，美国将继续反对共产党以暴力推翻现有政府的行为”。这就是说，美帝国主义今后仍将执行干涉中国内政的侵略政策，继续与中国人民及远东各国人民为敌。
