Protect the Legitimate Rights and Interests of Overseas Chinese
The Suffering of Our Compatriots in the French-Occupied Areas of Vietnam

Since the French imperialists invaded Vietnam after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our overseas Chinese residing in the French-occupied areas of Vietnam have suffered more severe devastation and persecution than before.

In the years of the French imperialists' colonial war against Vietnam, the property losses of our overseas Chinese have been incalculable. In the Battle of Haiphong on November 20, 1946, alone, 33 overseas Chinese houses were completely destroyed, 178 were partially damaged, with a total value of 9,168,000 Vietnamese currency; property losses were valued at more than 30,700,000 Vietnamese currency; 581 people were missing, 198 were arrested, 56 were injured, and 67 died, totaling 902 people. The number of unreported deaths and missing families is estimated to be about 1,000.

In addition to the disasters brought about by this heinous war of aggression, the French imperialists have exhausted all means to impose various restrictions, exploitation, and robberies on overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese in Vietnam had to pay "body tax," that is, head tax. In 1948, the French senior official in Vietnam ordered that all overseas Chinese men and women should pay 50 yuan per year. Since the French reactionary leader de Gaulle resumed his activities with the support of American imperialism, the French troops stationed in Vietnam forced the purchase of de Gaulle plaster statues door to door. If the overseas Chinese shops showed any dissatisfaction, they would be beaten on the spot, and even after being beaten, they were still forced to buy. If they did not buy, they would be charged with "aiding the Viet Minh" and "opposing the French government," the shop owner would be arrested, and the shop license would be confiscated. In addition, they had even more harsh extortion methods. That is, if they found that an overseas Chinese businessman was relatively wealthy, the detective bureau would notify him, announcing that his crime was "supporting Japan" (that is, falsely claiming that these overseas Chinese businessmen had assisted the Japanese invaders during the Japanese occupation), and ordering him to leave the country within forty-two hours, so that they could extort a large sum of money from it. Regarding the overseas Chinese economy, in order to attack the Vietnamese people and suppress prices, the French imperialists established the "South Vietnam Economic Bureau," stipulating that overseas Chinese were not allowed to engage in import and export business (before the war, the exports operated by overseas Chinese were mainly rice and local products, and the imports were mainly all raw materials and finished products), which was a fatal blow to overseas Chinese economically.

The French imperialists also colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "consulate" special agent organs to carry out planned and inhumane looting and massacres of overseas Chinese:

In early 1946, when the French army had just landed in Saigon and was struggling to suppress the Viet Minh, Li Bingshu, a Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent and lackey of the French imperialists, offered his master the "Baojia System" used by the Kuomintang reactionary group to rule the people in China, stipulating that if Viet Minh elements were found in a certain Bao or Jia in the Chinese district, the entire Bao and Jia would be punished simultaneously; those who sympathized with the Viet Minh were also guilty. The French imperialists originally wanted to follow this plan, but the overseas Chinese unanimously opposed it and resolutely refused to mutually appoint Baojia chiefs, and the Baojia system was not implemented. But even more vicious methods came again. From 1946 to 1947, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "consulate" special agent organs offered the French imperialists the sinister plan of the "Overseas Chinese Neutral Zone" to attack the Viet Minh and kill overseas Chinese, calling on overseas Chinese to concentrate in areas designated by the French imperialists to live, saying it was to "guarantee safety," but it required "no Viet Minh elements to exist in the area," its purpose was to allow the French imperialists to take the opportunity to "eliminate Viet Minh sympathizers" and rob, burn, and kill. The so-called "neutral zone" was actually a slaughterhouse for the French imperialists to massacre overseas Chinese.

In 1948, in order to facilitate the rule of Vietnamese overseas Chinese, the French imperialists set up a "Overseas Chinese Affairs Office" in Di'an under the Overseas Chinese Affairs Section of the Saigon "Detective Building." The main task of this organization was to investigate so-called "bad elements" in the overseas Chinese community. As a result, the names of hundreds of overseas Chinese were put on the blacklist, and it is unknown how many overseas Chinese youths died under this slander.

In August, September, and October 1949, the French imperialists arrested more than 200 overseas Chinese and more than 1,000 Vietnamese in Saigon and Di'an, all of whom had been tortured to death in concentration camps. The French imperialists also implemented a "Overseas Chinese Adjustment Depot," which was in fact a new "Baojia System," that is, the population of each household must be registered, and each household was forced to be responsible for monitoring each other. If there were so-called "suspicious elements" in a certain area, "joint liability" would be imposed. Recently, the Dongrong Village, Dongjiao Village, and Qingling, Liugang and other massacres have occurred successively, which have been seen in recent newspapers and will not be described in detail.

The French imperialists' lackeys spread and dispatched hooligans among overseas Chinese workers to divide workers' organizations, and set up a puppet "General Labor Union" to confront the workers' own labor unions. They also organized a special agent hooligan group, the "National Martial Arts Hall," specializing in beating workers, disrupting labor unions, and putting more than 100 outstanding members of the labor union on a blacklist and presenting it to the French imperialists. Most of these workers disappeared.

The French imperialists did not relax their grip on overseas Chinese intellectuals. In 1948, the Education Association, composed of all progressive education circles of Vietnamese overseas Chinese, was dissolved, and the list of directors and supervisors of the Education Association and progressive cultural figures was posted all over the streets of West Dyke; these educators were successively expelled from the country.

This is the painful disaster that the French imperialists, colluding with the Kuomintang bandit gang's special agents, have inflicted on the Vietnamese overseas Chinese in the past four years. The bloody facts are far more than what has been described above. We Chinese people will never forget them.

    保护华侨正当权益
    越南法占区我侨胞的苦难
    自从法帝国主义者在抗日战争胜利后进攻越南以来，居住越南法占区的我国侨胞便遭受着比以前更为惨重的摧残与迫害。
    在法帝国主义对越南进行殖民战争的几年中，我侨胞财产的损失是难以数计的。仅在一九四六年十一月二十日海防之战，华侨房屋全毁者有三十三所，部分段坏者一七八间，总值越币九百一十六万八千元；财物损失值越币三千零七十余万，失踪五百八十一人，被捕一九八人，受伤五十六人，死亡六十七人，合计九百零二人，未报及全家死亡散失者约千人。
    除了这罪恶的侵略战争带来的灾害以外，法帝国主义更在各方面想尽方法对华侨加以种种限制、剥削与抢劫。华侨在越南都要纳“身税”，即人头税，一九四八年法驻越高级官员下令规定华侨男女每年一律纳税五十元。自从法国反动头子戴高乐在美帝支持下重新活动后，驻越法军把戴高乐石膏像沿门逼买，华侨商店稍有表示不满，便要当场挨打，挨打后仍然被逼着要买，如果不买，就加上“接济越盟”、“反对法政府”的罪名，把店主逮捕，商店牌照没收。此外，他们还有更苛酷的敲诈办法，那就是发现那个侨商比较有钱，就由侦探局通知他，宣布他的罪名是“资日”（即诬称这些侨商于日寇侵占时曾资助日寇），限令四十二小时内离境，这样他们就可以从中敲诈到一笔大财。对于华侨经济，法帝为了进攻越南人民，抑制物价，设立了“越南南部经济局”，规定不准华侨做出入口生意（战前华侨经营的出口以米及土产为大宗，入口以一切原料及制成品为大宗），这对华侨在经济上是一个致命打击。
    法帝并与蒋匪“领馆”特务机关，互为勾结，有计划地对华侨进行惨无人道的抢掠、屠杀：
    一九四六年初，法军刚在西贡登陆，正苦于无力镇压越盟的时候，法帝走狗蒋匪特务李秉恕向其主子献出国民党反动集团在中国统治人民的“保甲制”，规定如在华人区某保某甲发现有越盟分子活动，则全保全甲同时坐罪；如同情越盟者，亦属有罪。法帝本想照计而行，但华侨一致反对，坚决不互相推派保甲长，保甲制逐未得施行。而更狠毒的办法却又来了，一九四六年至四七年，蒋匪“领馆”特务机关，又向法帝献出打击越盟、杀害华侨的“华侨中立区”的阴谋毒计，叫华侨集中在法帝指定的地区生活，说是“保障安全”，但却要“区内不得有越盟分子存在”，其目的在于使法帝得以借口“清除同情越盟分子”而抢掠烧杀。所谓“中立区”，实则是法帝屠杀华侨的屠场。
    一九四八年，法帝为了便于统治越南华侨，便在西贡“侦探楼”华侨事务科下分设“华侨事务所”于堤岸，这个组织的主要任务是调查侨社中的所谓“不良分子”。结果，数百华侨的名字被列入了黑名单，不知多少华侨青年在这种诬陷下死难。
    一九四九年八、九、十三个月里，法帝在西贡、堤岸逮捕了二百多个华侨和一千多名越南人，他们都已被毒刑打死在集中营里。法帝并又实行一种“华侨调剂库”，事实上是一种新的“保甲制”，即每家住户人口须登记，强迫每家住户负责彼此监视的任务，如某区内有所谓“可疑分子”，则“连坐”处罚。最近则又连续发生了洞荣村、洞角村及青铃、流冈等惨案，已见近日报纸，不再详述。
    法帝国主义者的走狗在华侨工人中散布和派遣流氓进行分化工人团体的活动，并另自组织一个御用“总工会”与工人自己所组织的工联对抗，还组织了特务流氓集团的“国术馆”，专门殴打工友，捣乱工联，将工联一百多个优秀分子列上黑名单呈给法帝，这些工人便大部失踪。
    对于华侨知识分子，法帝也不放松。在一九四八年，将全部越南华侨进步教育界所组成的教育协会解散，并在西堤满街张贴教育协会的理监事及进步文化人的名单；这些教育工作者便被陆续驱逐出境。
    这就是四年来法帝勾结国民党匪帮特务加于越南华侨的惨痛的灾难，这血迹斑斑的事实上远不止以上所记述的这一些，我们中国人民是永远不会忘记的。
