    Soviet Students' Winter Vacation
    --Editorial from the Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda," December 27, 1949
    Translated by Zhang Quanmin

    The students' winter vacation begins on December 30th. On New Year's Eve, in schools and clubs, in youth palaces and cultural centers, in theaters and city squares, there will be beautifully decorated fir trees, sparkling with colorful, thousands upon thousands of bright lights. The children's New Year's holiday will be spent joyfully. Many desirable things await the Young Pioneers and students during the winter vacation. They have worked hard in the first half of the school year, and now they need a good rest.

    Our Party, the Soviet government, and Comrade Stalin have always tirelessly cared for the younger generation. The great Stalin's concern for children has become the law of life in socialist society.

    We have established all conditions to enable the Young Pioneers and students to spend their winter vacation interestingly and beneficially, and to strengthen their health. We have spent 6.32 million rubles just to set up fir trees for the children, according to the decision of the Secretariat of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. Just mentioning this is enough.

    The best masters of the Soviet stage will appear before the children. Their favorite films will be shown on the cinema screen. The competition fields and sports fields, gymnasiums and swimming pools, skating rinks and sledding stations, these places will open their doors to young athletes from 10:00 in the morning to 6:00 in the evening. Many excellent coaches, sports masters, and marksmen will participate in activities with the students. Tens of thousands of children will visit museums and exhibitions, factories and manufacturing plants.

    Famous figures in science and technology, literature and art, production innovators and rationalization proponents will meet with the Young Pioneers and students. The children will be given reports on the lives and careers of the great leaders of the working people, Lenin and Stalin. Scholars will tell the children about the heroic history of our motherland, the achievements of our motherland's science, and the people who have promoted and are promoting the progress of the motherland. These days, literary and musical evenings, discussions, concerts, and early film screenings are being held in schools and youth palaces, and exhibitions of the achievements of young technical workers, artists, and sculptors are being organized. In many republics, reviews of children's art troupes from various districts and cities are being held.

    Moscow theaters will hold early shows for students. At the Bolshoi Theater, they will be able to hear "Eugene Onegin" and see "Cinderella" and "Swan Lake"; at the Moscow Art Academic Theater, they can see "Dead Souls," "The Cherry Orchard," "The Forest," "The Poor Bride," and others. New children's plays will be staged for young audiences. Children's film festivals will be held in every district of the capital. These methods should be extended to other cities, and many performing and musical groups should be mobilized to go to rural schools and "children's homes." Enterprises and institutions' rural visiting groups and Communist Youth League organizations can do many things for the children in "children's homes," such as wholeheartedly helping them to spend their holidays lively, setting up fir trees and skis for them, and inviting them to their clubs.

    It is good to send reporters, lecturers, athletes, and actors to rural schools. And it should also be thought of to bring them some children's films.

    The whole country is concerned about letting the students have a good winter vacation. This opens up a vast field of activity for the Communist Youth League organizations. Caring for the students' rest is our own personal matter. The responsibility of the Communist Youth League organizations is to actively participate in the preparation and leadership of the holidays in coordination with the national education and health departments, the trade unions, and the sports commissions, and to show more initiative, creativity, and perseverance in this work.

    It is very important to make the work of each school for the children during the holidays diverse and meaningful, and to conduct these activities in strict accordance with the characteristics of their age and in full compliance with the needs and interests of the children. Do not let life stagnate in the small playgrounds of the school, in the libraries, in the reading rooms and rest rooms.

    During the holidays, these forms of healthy work that have proven their value should be used among the students, such as courtyard camping. Here, the Communist Youth League members can help the children build ice rinks, pile up ice mountains and snow mountains, arrange interesting and beneficial games for them, and care for the children to be often in gardens and parks, and often go to cinemas and theaters.

    The Communist Youth League's district committees, municipal committees, and state committees should do their best to ensure that our children are more often in the fresh air in order to exercise their health. At the same time, various competitions, tours, reviews of amateur art activities, and evening parties should not over fatigue the students under any circumstances. This can only bring harm to their rest and health.

    We want to help the children spend their holidays in an organized, joyful, and interesting way, so that they can engage in tenacious study with new strength on January 11th.

    苏联学生的冬假
    ——一九四九年十二月二十七日苏联《共产主义青年团真理报》社论
    张全民译
    十二月三十日学生们的冬假开始了。除夕夜里，在学校和俱乐部里，在少年馆和文化馆里，在剧院里和城市的广场上，到处都将有装饰美丽的枞树，闪烁出五光十色成千成万明亮的火花。儿童们的新年节日将要愉快地度过。冬假期中很多令人向往的东西正等待着少年先锋队员们和学生们。他们在本学年的上半年操劳不少了，现在他们是需要好好地休息了。
    我们的党，苏维埃政府，斯大林同志始终不倦地关切着青年一代。伟大的斯大林对于孩子们的关怀，已经成为社会主义社会的生活法则了。
    我们为了使少先队员们和学生们有兴趣地、有益地度过冬假，并加强自己的身体健康，已经建立了一切条件。我们仅仅为了给孩子设置枞树一项，按照全苏职工会中央理事会秘书处的决定，就付出了六百三十二万卢布，单提这一点就够了。
    苏维埃舞台上的最优秀的名手将出现在孩子们的面前。在电影院的银幕上，将演映他们所喜爱的影片。竞赛场和运动场，体育馆和游泳池，溜冰场和雪撬站，这些场所的大门，为了招待青年的运动家们，将自早晨十时起至晚六时开放。许多优秀的教练，运动名手和射击手，将要和学生们一起活动。成千成万的儿童将参观博物馆和展览，工厂以及制造厂。
    科学和技术，文学和艺术的著名活动者，生产革新者和合理化运动者，将与少先队员们和学生们相见。给孩子们将报告有关劳动人民的伟大领袖列宁和斯大林的生平和事业。学者们将给孩子们讲述我们祖国的英勇的史迹、祖国科学的成就、以及曾经推动和正在推进祖国向前发展的人们。这些天，在学校里和少年馆里，正举行着文艺和音乐晚会、讨论会、演奏会、影剧早场，组织青年技术工作者、艺术家、雕刻家的成绩展览会。在许多共和国内，举行各区、各城市儿童艺术团的检阅。
    莫斯科各剧院为学生们将开演早场。在大剧院里，他们将能听到《尤金·奥尼金》，看到《仙履奇缘》，《天鹅湖》；在莫斯科艺术研究剧院里，可以看到《死魂灵》，《樱桃园》，《森林》，《异地亡魂》以及其他等等。对于少年观众，将上演新的儿童剧。在首都每一个区，都将举行儿童电影节。这些办法应推广到其他各城市，并发动许多演剧队和音乐队到乡村的学校和“儿童之家”。企业和机关的乡村访问团及共青团组织，可以为“儿童之家”里的孩子们做许多事，如他们衷心地从事帮助他们活泼地过假度期，为他们布置枞树和滑雪橇，并邀请他们到自己的俱乐部来。
    派报告者、讲演者、运动家和演员到乡村学校去是很好的。并且还应当想到带给他们一些儿童电影片。
    全国关怀着让学生们能好好地度过冬假。这在共青团组织的面前展开了广大的活动原野。关怀学生们的休息，是我们自己的切身的事情。共青团组织的责任，便是协同国民教育和保健机关，协同职工会以及体育运动委员会，积极地参加假期的准备和领导，在这件工作里要表现更多的主动性、创造性和坚韧性。
    要使假期中每一个学校对孩子们的工作是多样的和有内容的，举办这些工作应和他们年龄的特点严格地配合起来，并完全符合孩子们的需要和兴趣，这是非常重要的。不要让生活呆滞在学校的小小运动场上，在图书馆里，在阅览室和休息室里。
    在假期中，应当在学生中间运用这些已经证明自己有价值的有益健康的工作的形式，例如院中露营。在这里，共青团员可以帮助孩童建筑冰场，堆积冰山和雪山，为他们布置有趣的和有益的游戏，关心于使孩子们时常在花园和公园里，并常到电影院和剧院去。
    共青团的区委、市委和州委，应尽力使我们的孩子多在新鲜空气中，以锻炼其健康。同时各类的竞赛、游览旅行、业余艺术活动的检阅和晚会等，不论在何种情形下都不应使学生们过度疲劳。这只能给他们的休息和健康带来损害。
    我们要帮助儿童们有组织地，愉快地并有兴趣地度过自己的假日，使他们在一月十一日以新的力量从事顽强的学习。
