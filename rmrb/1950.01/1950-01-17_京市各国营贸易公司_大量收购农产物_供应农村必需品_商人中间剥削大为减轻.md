    Beijing State-Owned Trading Companies
    Massively Purchase Agricultural Products, Supply Essential Goods to Rural Areas
    Middleman Exploitation Greatly Reduced
    [This newspaper's report] Beijing’s state-owned trading companies have correctly grasped and implemented the policy of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, enabling considerable development in the exchange of goods between them. Over the past year, in the exchange of goods between Beijing and Inner Mongolia, western Liaoning, Jilin, Andong, Harbin, Shenyang, Shijiazhuang, and Chahar-Suiyuan, Taiyue, the city exported a total of 50,000 dozen towels, 73,000 dozen socks, 48,500 bolts of Beijing-produced colored cloth, 30,000 bolts of Beijing-produced striped cloth, and 5,200 dozen undershirts. It imported 12 million jin of millet, 600,000 jin of white sugar, 4,000 cubic meters of pine wood, 500,000 jin of wool, 150,000 jin of soybean oil, 100,000 gallons of gasoline, and 250 barrels of transformer oil (excluding allocations). The exported portion is equivalent to 12 million jin of millet. In addition, the companies also purchased a large amount of industrial raw materials from the countryside: the Oils and Fats Company purchased 1.4 million jin of oilseeds and 400,000 jin of vegetable oil. The Fur Company purchased 760,000 jin of various types of wool, 170,000 various hides, 30,000 jin of various colored wool, and 18,000 bundles of pig and sheep intestines. The Native Produce Company purchased 400,000 jin of mountain products and 700,000 jin of medicinal materials. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company purchased 2 million jin of ginned cotton and 6 million jin of seed cotton. The Bristle Company purchased 50,000 jin (customs jin) of pig bristles. The Grain Company purchased 9 million jin of wheat. The Egg Products Company purchased 110,000 eggs. Although the Yumin Mountain Goods Station had limited capital (85,000 jin of millet), it still earned considerable profit and provided great benefits to the peasant masses during its half-year (April to October) operation. In half a year, the station handled 1 million jin of peach and apricot kernels, peppercorns, etc., 15,000 jin of medicinal materials, with a total value of 580 million yuan (RMB); it sold 130 million yuan worth of industrial products to peasants (including 9,600 bolts of Hebei eastern local cloth, 2,000 pieces of used clothing, and essential goods such as matches, kerosene, cigarettes, table salt, and soap). The station obtained a net profit of 120,000 jin of millet; peasants also earned 687,000 jin more millet by selling mountain goods to the station compared to selling them to private merchants.

            Experience in Organizing Material Exchange
    Based on the practice of exchanging goods over the past year, the following are some experiences: 1. To develop the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, it must be jointly led by administrative bodies, trading companies, and cooperatives, together with private merchants, to promptly resolve problems that cannot be solved by public or private entities alone, such as transportation, taxation, remittance, administrative restrictions, and the integration of several businesses. 2. Leaders must pay attention to overcoming regional and departmental localism, which often creates significant obstacles to the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. 3. In terms of price control, production and consumption needs, and even the use-value of commodities, we must adhere to the principle of mutual benefit. 4. Establish credibility. Commodities must be standardized, and business must be regularized to establish normal production and sales relationships, which can avoid the problem of prolonged inability to exchange after price fluctuations and is beneficial to small producers. 5. Combining several different businesses at the same time is the most effective way to solve the difficulties in the exchange of goods. However, since the interests of different businesses are inconsistent, ways must be found to resolve this contradiction based on the specific situation. 6. The tasks of purchasing and sales must be transformed from shock efforts to regular activities (of course, there are still shock tasks) to meet the current needs of the countryside.

    京市各国营贸易公司
    大量收购农产物  供应农村必需品
    商人中间剥削大为减轻
    【本报讯】北京市国营各贸易公司正确掌握和执行城乡互助政策，使城乡物资交流获得相当开展。一年来，本市与内蒙古、辽西、吉林、安东、哈尔滨、沈阳、石家庄及察绥、太岳等地交换物资中，共输出毛巾五万打，袜子七万三千打，京产色布四万八千五百匹，京产条布三万匹，背心五千二百打；输入小米一千二百万斤，白糖六十万斤，松木四千立方米，毛绒五十万斤，豆油十五万斤，汽油十万加仑，变压器油二百五十桶（调拨者在外）。输出部分折合小米一千二百万斤。此外各公司亦收购了乡村的大量工业原料：计油脂公司收购油料一百四十万斤，植物油四十万斤。皮毛公司收购各种毛七十六万斤，各种皮十七万张，各色绒三万斤，猪、羊肠一万八千把。土产公司收购山货四十万斤，药材七十万斤。花纱布公司收购皮棉二百万斤，籽棉六百万斤。猪鬃公司收购猪鬃五万斤（海关斤）。粮食公司收购小麦九百万斤。蛋品公司收购鸡蛋十一万个。裕民山货栈虽然资金不大（八万五千斤小米），但在半年（四月至十月）经营中仍赚了相当利润，并给了农民群众很大利益。该栈半年中经营桃杏仁、花椒等一百万斤，药材一万五千斤，总值人民币五亿八千万元；售给农民工业品一亿三千余万元（包括冀东土布九千六百匹，估衣两千件及火柴、煤油、纸烟、食盐、肥皂等必需品）。该栈获得纯益小米十二万斤；农民出售山货也比售给私商多得小米六十八万七千余斤。
            组织物资交流的经验
    根据一年来交流物资的实践，经验有以下几点：一、要开展城乡物资交流，必须由行政结合贸易公司、合作社领导私商共同进行，以便及时解决公私单方面所不能解决的问题，如运输、税收、汇兑、行政限制、几种业务的结合等问题。二、领导上必须注意克服地区间、部门间的本位思想，这种思想时常对城乡物资交流造成很大障碍。三、在价格掌握上，生产与消费的需要上，以至商品使用价值上，一定要坚持两利原则。四、树立信用。商品要规格化，业务要经常化，以建立正常的产销关系，这样可避免在物价波动后长时间不能进行交换的毛病，且对小生产者有利。五、几种不同的业务同时结合进行，是解决物资交流中的困难的最有效办法。但几种业务之间的利益不一致，必须根据具体情况，设法解决这一矛盾。六、收购与推销任务，必须化突击为经常（当然还有突击任务），才能适合目前农村的需要。
