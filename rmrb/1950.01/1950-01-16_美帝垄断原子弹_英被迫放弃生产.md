Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th—Under strong pressure from the United States, Britain has finally abandoned its attempt to manufacture atomic bombs and has agreed to allow the United States to monopolize the production of atomic bombs and the uranium mines in the Belgian Congo and Canada.

The British Labour government's proposals on atomic energy cooperation between the United States, Britain, and Canada, reported in the New York Times on January 4, show that Britain is prepared to give up manufacturing atomic bombs but hopes to continue research on atomic weapons. At the same time, Britain has expressed its willingness to follow Canada's example and "lend" its scientists to the United States to assist in atomic weapons research. The requirements put forward by the United States are that the United States store atomic weapons in Britain and inform Britain of relevant atomic energy information at any time.

New York sources point out that it is doubtful whether this desperate plea from the Labour government, hoping that the United States will not force Britain to completely stop atomic research work, will have any effect on Washington. Because in the original draft of the so-called "bilateral agreement" for military assistance under the Atlantic regional defense plan, the United States demanded that Britain abandon "overlapping production." That is to say, Britain must dismantle the factory equipment and laboratories that produce weapons that are the same as the materials of "US military aid". Once Britain agrees to this principle, future atomic research work and other industrial research work will inevitably be decided by the United States' considerations, and the proposals put forward by the Labour government will become useless. It is reported that the reason why the United States wants to stop British scientists from researching atomic energy is also for the benefit of public utility monopoly capitalists. They are deeply afraid that British and French scientists may work as hard as Soviet scientists to discover methods of using atomic energy for peaceful industrial purposes, which is precisely what American monopoly capitalists are trying to suppress in the United States.

### 美帝垄断原子弹  英被迫放弃生产

    美帝垄断原子弹
    英被迫放弃生产
    【新华社北京十五日电】在美国强大压力之下，英国终于放弃制造原子弹的企图，而同意由美国垄断原子弹生产及比属刚果与加拿大的铀矿。
    纽约时报一月四日报道的英国工党政府所提关于美、英、加在原子能方面合作的建议显示：英国准备放弃制造原子弹，但希望能继续进行研究原子武器。同时英国表示愿意模仿加拿大的榜样，把本国的科学家“借”给美国协助研究原子武器。美国方面所提的要求是：美国在英国贮存原子武器，并将有关原子能的情报随时通知英国。
    纽约消息指出：工党政府这种绝望的哀求，即希望美国不要强迫英国完全停止原子研究工作一点，对华盛顿究能发生任何效力，殊可怀疑。因为在实施大西洋区域防御计划下军事援助的所谓《双边协定》的原草案中，美国曾要求英国放弃“重叠的生产”。这就是说：英国必须拆卸那些生产与美国“军援”物资相同的武器的工厂设备和实验室。英国一旦同意这个原则，将来对于原子研究工作以及其他工业研究工作，势必都由美国的考虑来决定，工党政府所提的建议将变成毫无用处。据悉，美国所以要停止英国科学家对原子能的研究工作，也是为了公用事业独占资本家的利益。他们深恐英法科学家可能为苏联的科学家一样努力发现把原子能用于和平工业的方法，而这正是美国独占资本家在美国所竭力压制的。
