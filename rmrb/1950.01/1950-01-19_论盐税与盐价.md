    On Salt Tax and Salt Price
    He Li
            (I)
    Since the People's Government increased the salt tax rate this January (one jin of salt equals one jin of rice), salt prices in various regions have also risen accordingly. The salt price in Tianjin has increased by two and a half times, and in areas around Jinnan, Handan, and Hengshui, it has nearly doubled. Although this salt price is still not considered high compared to the salt price during the Kuomintang bandit regime's rule before the Anti-Japanese War, the salt tax has historically been branded as a "vicious tax" during the reactionary rule, inevitably causing criticism from some people.
    Yes, the salt tax is not a very reasonable tax system. The salt tax belongs to the consumption tax. From its manifestation, it does not directly take from the people, but after transportation and sales, it is indirectly passed on entirely to the people. Salt is a necessary daily commodity for everyone. Regardless of wealth or social class, everyone must consume salt. Moreover, the annual consumption per person is generally similar, with the maximum being no more than ten jin and the minimum requiring five or six jin. Precisely because of such average consumption, from the government's perspective of tax collection, the stability of the salt tax is demonstrated. However, from the people's perspective, due to its averaging effect, it is unfavorable to the vast working class of workers and peasants, who become the main bearers of the salt tax, which is extremely inconsistent with the principle of "those who have money should contribute money."
    However, our view of a thing must be from a global perspective and cannot be isolated. In other words, our analysis of the people's burden today must focus on the premise of national financial difficulties and must be measured by comparing various taxes.
    Today's China is a China where the Liberation War has not yet completely ended, a China where everything is waiting to be rebuilt after years of war. The current situation in China determines that our newly established country faces many difficulties and must find ways to overcome these difficulties. The increase in salt prices and the increase in salt tax, like increasing other taxes and issuing public bonds, are to overcome these difficulties.
    As for what is reasonable and unreasonable, there are two questions worth studying here. First, we should see if it is in line with the long-term interests of the broad masses of people? Second, we should see if it affects the current livelihood of the people?
    Regarding the first question, although the broad masses of working people are temporarily increasing some burden today, this burden is fundamentally beneficial to the broad masses of people. The logic is very simple, that is, only by completely eliminating the remaining enemies in the future can the people achieve complete liberation. Only by taking out a little more money today to build a new China and improve social productivity can the people's lives be improved.
    Regarding the second question, the increase in salt tax will not affect the people's lives. Because salt does not account for a large proportion of people's lives like grain and cloth. Its consumption is very small. Calculated at an average of eight jin of salt per person per year, and one jin of salt equals one jin of tax, each person only pays eight jin of millet a year. Calculated for a family of fourteen, a peasant family only spends two dou of millet a year. Now is the winter production season, and they can earn it with a little labor. As for workers, they only need two days of work to pay the whole family's annual tax. Conversely, increasing the salt tax, like accumulating fur into a robe, will play a significant role in this year's victory and construction.
    In fact, our salt tax is lighter than the salt tax during the Kuomintang reactionary rule. If we compare it with the entire salt price, it is even lighter.
    Before the Anti-Japanese War, the salt tax during the Kuomintang bandit regime's rule was second only to customs in terms of annual revenue. According to the Changlu Salt Bureau, before the Anti-Japanese War in North China, the tax for each dan of salt was eight yuan and one jiao, equivalent to 170 jin of millet at that time. Before the war, the salt tax during the Kuomintang rule was generally around 150-160 jin of millet per dan, while our current tax rate per dan of salt is only 100 jin of millet, which is lighter than the salt tax set by the Kuomintang reactionary government. We cannot consider today's salt tax to be heavy.
            (II)
    As for salt prices, in areas with longer liberation periods, such as the Northeast and North China, salt prices are generally not high due to the strengthening of salt administration and the elimination of the monopoly of bureaucratic capital and the feudal exploitation of salt merchants. Here, we might as well make a comparative discussion of the salt affairs during the Kuomintang period and our current liberated areas.
    Salt production has always been a rich resource in China. In coastal areas, salt farmers generally use manual labor to dry salt by the sea. In areas with mineral salt in the Northwest, farmers regard salt extraction as a sideline, and some can extract 2,000 jin of salt a day, which does not require any production technology. Therefore, the production cost of salt in various regions is low.
    Although the production cost of edible salt is low, in the past Kuomintang period, due to the collusion between salt merchants and bureaucratic capital and their heavy exploitation, producers and consumers suffered significant damage. Specialized merchants have a long-standing hereditary tradition. The so-called "specialized merchant's license" method divides the country into many sales areas and assigns them to salt merchants for exclusive sales. This combination of officials and merchants creates monopolies and speculation; on the one hand, they cruelly exploit salt farmers, often pushing salt prices below the production cost. Even worse, they use salt farmers' hunger and cold to exploit them through usury, obtaining large amounts of salt for very little money. On the other hand, they exclusively sell in fixed areas, prohibiting local people from buying salt from other places. Coupled with heavy taxes, salt prices are very expensive. For example, it is very convenient for Nanjing to eat salt from Huainan. The cost of one jin of salt in Huainan is only two fen, but after being transported to Nanjing by salt merchants, it costs one jiao and five fen (including tax). If one public bond is converted into a real unit equal to one yuan before the Anti-Japanese War, it is equal to the current RMB 2,200 yuan. And we only need 1,150 yuan now, which is twice as expensive. The salt price in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, is also the same. As for Henan, it sells for one jiao and nine to two jiao, and the people need four jin of millet to buy one jin of salt. In 1929, due to the people's appeal, the Kuomintang reactionary government once proposed abolishing the merchant monopoly, but due to the collusion between salt merchants and bureaucratic capital, the result was not realized, and the merchant monopoly system was preserved. This fully illustrates that our current salt tax is not high, and the salt price is not expensive.
    Furthermore, taking the Anti-Japanese War as an example, the salt price is naturally lower in areas that produce salt, but as soon as you leave the salt area, due to the enemy's heavy blockade, any small group of enemy puppet military police can set up checkpoints to collect taxes and fees. Every thirty or forty miles, you have to pay a toll. In addition, transportation is inconvenient, relying entirely on human and animal transport, and the freight is particularly staggering. The people in the Taihang Liberated Area eat salt from the Binhai area, costing four to five jin of millet per jin. And now that there are no heavy checkpoints and traffic has gradually resumed, it costs about two jin of millet per jin, which is much lighter than in the past. This also shows that today's victorious situation, even though the salt tax rate has increased, is still much cheaper than in the past.
    Why is our salt price not considered expensive today even though the tax rate has increased? In addition to the reasons such as the overthrow of bureaucratic capital, the abolition of the specialized merchant system, domestic unification, and convenient transportation, the most important thing is the People's Government's unified management of the salt industry and the policy of small profits and quick turnover. For example, the North China Salt Affairs Bureau uses the Changlu Salt Area for centralized production, implements planned distribution and sales with Tianjin as the center, and unifies the cost and profit regulations. This not only guarantees the people's consumption but also stabilizes the price, making it impossible for private merchants to manipulate and stir up trouble (but they can also obtain correct profits).
    Based on this experience, as long as the government strengthens salt administration in the future, makes planned use of the convenience of water and land transportation, supplies various regions, and effectively controls salt prices, even if the salt tax is slightly heavier, the people in various regions can eat cheap salt.
            (III)
    How to reduce salt prices? The most central issue is to control transportation and sales and adjust profits. The most important components of salt prices are: 1. Production cost (factory price), 2. Salt tax, 3. Packaging and miscellaneous fees, 4. Transportation fee, 5. Profit, and other indirect costs such as salt consumption, working capital, and routine expenses. These are the basic factors that determine salt prices. If we strictly reorganize, many expenses can be reduced. For example, the production cost of Changlu salt last year originally required seven jin of millet per dan, but after reorganization by the Salt Affairs Administration, each dan of salt only needed four jin and twelve taels. However, the production cost was originally very low and cannot be excessively reduced. On the contrary, wages should be appropriately increased to take care of the lives of salt workers and salt farmers. The reduction in production costs mainly relies on the use of machinery and equipment, centralized production, and strengthened management to reduce expenses. For example, the expenses of the Changlu Salt Bureau accounted for 30% of the income during the Kuomintang rule, but now it only accounts for 2%. The management cost of the Dagu state-owned salt field has generally been reduced by 30%, which greatly reduces the cost. Other packaging and miscellaneous expenses can be reduced as long as they are carefully calculated.
    But this is not the main thing. The main thing is to rectify transportation and reduce freight. Our country has basically been unified today. Railways and shipping are basically controlled by the state, so we have sufficient conditions to control transportation. In places with railways, public transportation should be developed (of course, private transportation should also be taken care of), so as to avoid private merchants' manipulation and hoarding. In areas with inconvenient transportation, it is best to organize mass transportation, such as the method in Shandong, setting up stations along the way to help the masses transport; this not only reduces the intermediate exploitation of the masses but also increases the income of the masses. If we can organize transportation well and provide sufficient and regular salt supply to all parts of the country, we can also avoid the drastic rise and fall of salt prices due to supply and demand relations, and avoid the losses suffered by producers and consumers.
    The second is to adjust profits. Salt transportation and sales have always been monopolistic. In the past, because they were controlled by a few salt merchants, they manipulated salt prices and exploited salt producers, transporters (in areas using manual transportation), and consumers, thereby obtaining excessive profits. Now we manage transportation and sales by adopting a policy of small profits and quick turnover. First, we must ensure that producers can obtain production costs and appropriate profits so that they can work hard to produce. Second, we must ensure that transporters (in areas using manual transportation) obtain sufficient freight so that they can work hard to transport. Third, we must reduce salt prices as much as possible to protect the interests of consumers. We can no longer allow salt merchants to hoard and manipulate. Therefore, we should carry out concurrent transportation and sales under leadership, and determine salt prices according to the general price trend of the market, the distance from the production area, and the turnover of funds, so that merchants can obtain certain profits, but they cannot obtain excessively high profits.
    As long as the salt affairs agencies in various regions can grasp these two points, the salt price will not be very high.

    论盐税与盐价
    贺笠
            （一）
    自从今年一月人民政府提高了盐税的比率（一斤盐一斤米）以后，各地盐价亦随之上升。天津盐价提高了二倍半，冀南、邯郸、衡水一带，亦将近提高一倍。虽然这种盐价，按抗战前国民党匪帮统治时期的盐价比较仍不算高；但由于盐税在反动统治时期历来负有“恶税”的罪名，致不免引起一部分人士的非议。
    是的，盐税是一种不很合理的税制。盐税属于消费税，从其表现来看，它并不直接取之于民，但它经过运销之后，就间接地全部转嫁到人民身上了。盐是每个人必需的生活品，不论贫富，也不论那个阶层，通通都得吃盐，而且每人一年消费量大体上差不多，多者不过十斤，少者也需五、六斤。正由于这样平均消费，从政府的收税来说，也就表现了盐税的稳固性；但从人民方面来说，由于它的平均作用，对于广大工农劳苦人民是不利的，他们成了盐税的主要负担者，极不合于有钱出钱的原则。
    但是，我们对于一个事物的看法，必需从全局着眼，不能孤立地去提出问题。也就是说，我们今天对于人民负担的分析，必须从全国财政困难这一前提去着眼，必需从各种税收的比较中去衡量。
    今天的中国是解放战争尚未最后结束的中国，是经过连年战争百废待举的中国，当前中国的形势，就决定了我们这个刚成立的新国家，面临着许多困难，而且还必需想尽办法去克服这些困难。盐价的增涨，盐税的提高，亦如增加其他税收、发行公债一样，是为要克服这些困难的。
    所谓合理不合理，在这里，有两个问题值得我们研究，第一、我们应该看它是否符合广大人民的长远利益？第二、我们应该看它是否影响现时人民生计？
    就第一个问题来说，今天的广大劳苦人民虽是暂时增加了一些负担，但这种负担基本是有利于广大人民的。道理很简单，就是说只有今后将残敌根本消灭了，人民才能获得彻底的解放。只有今天多拿出一点钱，建设了新中国，提高了社会生产力，人民生活才能得到改善。
    就第二个问题来说，盐税的增加并不会影响人民生活。因为盐并不像粮食布匹那样在人民生活中占着很大的比重。它的消费量是很小的。每人一年平均以八斤盐计，一斤盐一斤税，一人一年才纳八斤小米。以一四口之家计算，一家农民一年不过只出二斗小米。现在正是冬季生产，稍一劳动就挣出来了。至于工人，只需两天工就可以缴纳了全家全年的税。相反地，增加盐税，集腋成裘，对今年的胜利与建设都将会起很大的作用。
    事实上，我们的盐税比国民党反动统治时期的盐税是轻的，如以全部盐价来作比较，那就更轻了。
    抗战前国民党匪帮统治时期的盐税，岁入之巨仅次于海关。据长芦盐局计算，华北抗战以前每担盐是八元一角钱的税合当时小米一百七十斤。战前国民党统治时期的盐税一般每担均在一百五、六十斤小米左右，而我们现在每担盐的税率仅仅一百斤小米，比起国民党反动政府所定的盐税要轻，我们不能认为今天的盐税是重的。
            （二）
    至于盐价，凡在解放较久的地方如东北、华北等地，由于加强了盐务管理，扫除了官僚资本的垄断及盐商的封建剥削，盐价一般是不高的。这里我们无妨把国民党时期的盐务及我们今天解放区的盐务作一比较的论述。
    盐产向为中国丰富的资源，在沿海一带，一般盐民多利用手工在海边晒盐。在西北有矿盐的地方，农民把捞盐当做副业，有的一天即可捞出二千斤盐，并不需要什么生产技术。因而各地盐产生产成本均低。
    食盐的生产成本虽低，然而过去国民党时期，由于盐商与官僚资本的狼狈为奸，重重剥削，使生产者与消费者蒙受重大损害。专商有长时间的世袭传统，所谓“专商引岸”办法，把全国分为许多销区划归盐商专卖。这样官商结合，就造成垄断居奇；一方面残酷剥削盐民，常常把盐价压到生产成本以下。尤有甚者，他们更利用盐民在饥寒交迫的时候，以高利贷的方式盘剥，不用几个钱，即可获得大量的盐。另一方面又在固定的地区专销，不准当地人民到外地买盐，加上苛重的税收，使盐价非常昂贵。如南京吃淮南的盐是很近便的。淮南一斤盐只要二分钱的成本，经过盐商之手运到南京即要一角五分钱（连税在内）。如以一分公债折实单位等于抗战前一元洋计算，即等于现在人民币二千二百多元。而我们现在则只要一千一百五十元，要贵一倍。河北省石家庄的盐价亦是如此。至于河南要卖到一角九至二角，老百姓需四斤小米，才能买得一斤盐。一九二九年，由于人民的呼吁，国民党反动政府虽曾有废除商专卖之议，但由于盐商与官僚资本的勾结，结果亦未实现，商专卖制度一直保存。这充分说明，我们今天的盐税并不高，盐价并不贵。
    再以抗战时期而论，凡在出盐的地区自然盐价较低，但一稍离盐区，由于敌人重重封锁，任何一小股敌伪军警，均可设卡收税捐，每隔三四十里，即要交一道买路钱，加以运输不便，全靠人畜驮运，运费之大，尤为惊人。太行解放区人民吃滨海区的盐，每斤得四至五斤小米。而现在既无重重关卡，交通已渐恢复，每斤约值二斤小米左右，较之过去亦大大减轻，这也说明了今天胜利后的局面，虽然就增加了盐税税率，也仍然是比过去便宜得多的。
    为什么我们今天的盐价虽提高了税率而仍不算贵呢？除了官僚资本被打倒，专商制度被取销，国内统一，交通方便等原因外，最重要的就是人民政府对于盐业的统一管理与薄利多销政策；如华北盐务局利用长芦盐区集中生产，以天津为中心实行有计划的分配运销，并统一规定成本与利润，这样不仅保证了人民的食用，且稳定了价格，使私商无法操纵兴风作浪（但亦能获得正确的利润）。
    根据这一经验，只要政府今后加强盐务管理，有计划的利用水陆交通的方便，供应各地，切实掌握盐价，纵然盐税稍重，也可使各地人民能吃到便宜的盐。
            （三）
    如何减低盐价呢？最中心的问题是掌握运销，调节利润。盐价的组成部份，最主要的：一、生产成本（厂价），二、盐税，三、包装筑杂费，四、运输费，五、利润，其他另有耗盐，周转补差，经常费等间接成本。这是决定盐价的基本因素。如果我们严加整理，许多费用都可以减低，如去年长芦盐的生产成本，由于盐务管理局的悉心经营，原来每担盐需七斤小米，经过整理每担盐只需四斤十二两；但生产成本原来就很低，不能过度减少，相反的，在工资方面还应适当提高，以照顾盐工盐民生活，生产成本的减低，主要是利用机器设备，集中生产，及加强管理，减少开支。如长芦盐局的开支，国民党统治时期要占收入百分之三十，现在只要百分之二，大沽公营盐场管理费用一般减少百分之三十，这就大大减低了成本。其他包装筑杂等，只要精打细算，是可以减低消费的。
    但这还不是主要的。主要的是整顿运输，降低运费。我们国家今天已基本上得到统一。铁道航运基本掌握在国家手里，因此我们已有充分条件掌握运输。凡有铁道的地方应发展公运（当然还要照顾私运），这样就可免除私商的操纵囤积。凡交通不便的地区，最好组织群众运输，如像山东的办法，沿途设站帮助群众运输；不仅使群众减少了中间剥削，还增加了群众收入。如果我们能很好组织运输，使全国各地都有充足的经常的食盐供给，亦可免去盐价因供求关系而暴涨暴跌，使生产者与消费者遭受到的损失。
    其次是调节利润、食盐运销历来是有独占性的，过去因被少数盐商控制，他们操纵盐价，剥削盐的生产者、运输者（在用人工运输地区）、消费者，从而获取超额利润。现在我们管理运销则采取薄利多销的政策。第一要保证生产者能获生产成本和适当的利润，使其努力生产。第二要保证运输者（在用人工运输地区）获得足够的运费，使其努力运输。第三要尽可能减低盐价，以保护消费者的利益。我们不能再让盐商囤积操纵，因此我们应当有领导的进行兼运兼销，按照市场一般物价的趋势，离产区的远近，资金的周转而确定盐价，使商人能获得一定的利润，但也不能获得过高的超额的利润。
    只要各地盐务机关能把握住这两点，盐价是不会很高的。
