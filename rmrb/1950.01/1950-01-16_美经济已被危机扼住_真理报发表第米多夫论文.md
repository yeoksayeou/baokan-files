Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: TASS Moscow reports: *Pravda* published on the 12th an essay by Dimitrov on the American economic situation, citing charts from the American magazine *Business Week* to demonstrate that the American economy is gripped by crisis.

The economic situation of the most powerful country in the capitalist world is as follows: Taking the level of 1923-1925 as 100, the index of economic activity rose to 180 in June 1946, a slight increase compared to the last year before the war, but far below the "boom" of the war era. After rising to 180, this line almost stopped at this level, with occasional slight fluctuations. Overall, it is a horizontal line, sometimes indicating a negligible upward trend. This creeping line was regarded by American bourgeois economists as "stability" of the American capitalist economy. At the end of 1948, this curve had very difficulty exceeding the record of 190, at which time the American bourgeois newspapers rejoiced and said: "Prosperity" is returning.

But subsequently, this line declined sharply. By July 1949, the general index was far below pre-war levels. In September, the index briefly climbed feverishly to 185, but in October, this line dropped sharply to around 160; in early November, it dropped to 159. It has remained at this bottom until the end of the year. Thus, not only did "prosperity" prove to be a boast, but "stability" was also proven to be no different than stagnant mud covered with duckweed.

Dimitrov pointed out that the decline of the American economy in 1949 was neither accidental nor unexpected. It is the result of the crisis phenomena of the "prosperity" years of 1947 and 1948.

    美经济已被危机扼住
    真理报发表第米多夫论文
    【新华社北京十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报十二日登载第米多夫所撰关于美国经济情势的论文，引用美国杂志《商业周刊》的图表，证明美国经济已被危机所扼住。
    资本主义世界最强大国家的经济情况如下：把一九二三年——一九二五年的水平作为一○○，经济活动的指数在一九四六年六月升至一八○，这较战前的最后一年有些微的上升，但远低于战争时代的“景气”。这条线升至一八○后，差不多停止在这个水平上，间或有些微的波动。整个说来，它是一条水平线。有时表示一种微不足道的上升趋势。这条爬行的线被美国资产阶级经济学家当作是美国资本主义经济的“稳定”。在一九四八年底，这条曲线曾极困难地超过了一九○的纪录，当时美国资产阶级的报纸兴高采烈地说：“繁荣”正在重新降临。
    但嗣后这条线剧烈地下降，至一九四九年七月，总的指数已远低于战前。在九月间，指数一度发烧似地爬上了一八五，但在十月间，这条线剧烈地下降至一六○左右；在十一月初，下降至一五九。就在这个底端，它一直停留到年度。因此不仅“繁荣”证明是一种吹嘘，“稳定”亦被证明与长满水萍的烂泥无异。
    第米多夫指出：美国经济在一九四九年的下降，既不是偶然的，也不是出于预料的。它是一九四七及一九四八“繁荣”年代的危机现象的结果。
