    Municipal Government Promulgates Four Decrees
    Cracking Down on Illegal Activities Such as Hoarding and Speculation, and Empty Transactions

    [Beijing News] To protect the legitimate operation of legitimate industry and commerce, to facilitate the recovery and development of production, to stabilize people's lives and market order, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, after several months of research and discussion, has specially promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Cracking Down on Illegal Commercial Activities," "Provisional Rules for the Management of Public Commercial (Market) Places," "Provisional Rules for the Management of Grain Exchange Transactions," and "Provisional Rules for the Management of Cotton Cloth Exchange Transactions," four decrees, which will be implemented from today, except as otherwise stipulated by central laws and regulations.

    The "Provisional Measures for Cracking Down on Illegal Commercial Activities" stipulates that any of the following eleven behaviors for the purpose of seeking exorbitant profits or evading management, such as hoarding and speculation, raising prices, cornering supplies, engaging in empty transactions, manufacturing or selling counterfeit trademarks, etc., shall be deemed as illegal commercial activities. If illegal commercial activities are found to be true after investigation, the Municipal Commercial Bureau shall impose penalties according to the severity of the circumstances, and those whose circumstances are serious or who repeatedly refuse to mend their ways shall be sent to the court for trial. The measures make clear provisions for various illegal commercial activities and the corresponding penalties. The measures also encourage citizens to report current offenders engaged in illegal commercial activities, and the municipal government is responsible for keeping the names of citizens who are unwilling to disclose their names confidential.

    The "Provisional Rules for the Management of Public Commercial (Market) Places" stipulates that each commercial (market) place shall have a management office, which shall manage the affairs of the place under the leadership of the Commercial Bureau. Anyone who leases land or buildings in a commercial (market) place must do so for the purpose of operating a business in the place. The measures stipulate the rules for the use of land and buildings in the market place, stipulate that legal weights and measures must be used for transactions, and prices must be clearly marked. At the same time, methods for maintaining security, sanitation, and traffic in the market place are stipulated. Anyone who violates the rules and is found by the management office shall be given a warning for minor violations, and the Commercial Bureau or relevant competent authority shall be notified for punishment in the case of serious violations.

    The "Provisional Rules for the Management of Grain Exchange Transactions" and the "Provisional Rules for the Management of Cotton Cloth Exchange Transactions" stipulate the qualifications for applying for regular or temporary entry into the exchange for transactions. Those who enter the exchange for transactions must wear an entry permit, which must not be lent or transferred. Transactions must be conducted according to the nature of the business: transportation and sales businesses are only allowed to sell goods; retail businesses are only allowed to buy goods; manufacturing or processing industries are only allowed to buy raw materials and sell finished products (but those who are truly engaged in material exchange may make exceptions with the approval of the Commercial Bureau). Those who enter the grain exchange for transactions may directly buy and sell, or entrust exchange staff to introduce buyers and sellers; those who trade on the cloth exchange must entrust traders to buy and sell, as for the price, it shall be freely negotiated publicly by the buyers and sellers. The rules stipulate the various necessary procedures for transactions, and strictly stipulate that "those entering the exchange for transactions and traders must not engage in illegal activities such as buying and selling short, futures speculation, profiteering, spreading rumors to inflate prices, buying and selling fake goods, or engaging in fraud and deception"; at the same time, "the exchange has the right to send personnel at any time to inspect the transaction information of those entering the exchange for transactions." Those who violate the regulations shall have their transaction income cancelled or their qualification to enter the exchange suspended, and those whose circumstances are serious shall be sent to the competent authority for punishment.
