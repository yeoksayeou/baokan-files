Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 7th: TASS, London, January 5th: The Worker's Daily diplomatic correspondent reports: Differences between British Foreign Secretary Bevin and the newly appointed Australian Foreign Minister Spender are likely to be apparent at the Colombo Conference. The reporter writes: It is understood that Bevin is very unhappy about Australia's unwillingness to assume its share of responsibility in the Pacific. "He believes Australia should help guard Hong Kong and send troops to fight in Malaya." The reporter points out that the new Australian government is eager to play a larger role of an imperialist power in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. Spender does not seem to like the idea that he should share the costly adventures of Hong Kong and Malaya, because Australian capitalists cannot derive visible benefits from such adventures. "Moreover, the Australian government wants to restore conscription. If people think that conscripts might be sent to Hong Kong or Malaya, then conscription will be even more unpopular than it is now." "At the same time, as observers say, Australia's relationship with Britain is growing colder, which means that the Menzies government is trying to partner with the United States and act as a lackey of the United States."

    英澳关系日趋冷淡
    澳政府正希图充当美帝走卒
    【新华社北京七日电】塔斯社伦敦五日讯：工人日报外交记者报道：英外长贝文和新任澳大利亚外长斯宾德之间的歧异，很可能会在科伦坡会议上表现出来。记者写道：据悉，贝文对澳大利亚不愿负起它在太平洋的一份责任一事，甚感不快。“他认为澳大利亚应该协助警卫香港，并派军队赴马来亚作战”。记者指出，新的澳大利亚政府渴望在太平洋和东南亚扮演较大的帝国主义国家的角色。斯宾德似乎不会喜欢这种意见，即他应该分担香港和马来亚这种费用浩大的冒险，因为澳大利亚资本家不能从这种冒险中得到看得见的利益。“而且，澳大利亚政府想恢复征兵制度。假如人们认为被征集者可能送往香港或马来亚，那么，征兵将会较之现在更不受人欢迎”。“同时，如观察家们所说的，澳大利亚与英国的关系正日趋冷淡，这就是说，孟席斯政府正在希图与美国合伙，当美国的小伙计。”
