    Zhangjiakou City Workers Take the Lead, Business Community Actively Participate
    Bond Sales Exceed Quota
    Reasons for the smooth completion: 1. Widespread and thorough publicity; 2. The sales committee widely absorbed people from all walks of life to participate, and the allocated figures were reasonable after democratic discussion; 3. Adopting the principle of lighter burden for workers than businesses, larger contributions from large households, and smaller contributions from small households.
    [This newspaper, Zhangjiakou News] After the Central People's Government announced its decision to issue Victory Bonds, all sectors of Zhangjiakou City responded with the utmost enthusiasm to subscribe and purchase. As of the 17th, employees of state-owned factories subscribed and purchased 13,107 shares of Victory Bonds, cadres and employees of provincial and municipal agencies, troops, and trade and banking departments subscribed and purchased 7,923 shares, wealthy households in Districts 1, 2, and 3 subscribed 64,490 shares, private industrial and commercial enterprises subscribed 137,783 shares, and small merchants subscribed 1,200 shares. The total subscriptions and purchases by all sectors of Zhangjiakou City amounted to 224,503 shares, successfully completing the pre-determined sales target and exceeding it by 4,503 shares.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 18th] Zhangjiakou City has basically completed its sales target of 220,000 Victory Real Value Bonds. Since the news of the decision to issue the People's Bonds came, workers and cadres in Zhangjiakou City have pre-purchased them one after another. Postal worker Su Yi bought bonds with 80 percent of his monthly salary. More than 400 employees of the Zhangyuan Machine Factory bought an average of three shares each. Railway worker Li Wanshou bought ten shares alone. Cadres on the supply system in various agencies also bought at least one share each. The Municipal Government's 120-plus staff pre-purchased 265 shares. After the bonds were officially issued, they purchased even more enthusiastically, buying more than 8,800 shares within five days. Under the influence of workers taking the lead in purchasing, the business community in Zhangjiakou City also began to take action on the 12th. Through self-reporting, public discussion, and agreement, 52 industries across the city have successively subscribed to 119,828 shares, exceeding the original target by more than 2,000 shares. Subscriptions from wealthy households and ordinary citizens in various districts also reached 64,490 shares. As of the 15th, the total number of bonds purchased and subscribed in the city reached 215,900 shares, only about 4,000 shares short of the 220,000 shares uniformly allocated to the city by the Chahar Province, and it is estimated that it will be fully completed within a few days.
    The reason why the bond sales work in Zhangjiakou City was so smooth this time is first and foremost because widespread and in-depth publicity and education work was carried out. In addition to publicity through newspapers, radio stations, and movie theater slides, the Representatives of All Circles Conference held in late December of last year also passed a resolution calling on the people of the city to enthusiastically subscribe to the bonds. Representatives from all walks of life then conducted in-depth publicity and encouraged purchases after the meeting. Secondly, the Zhangjiakou City Bond Sales Committee was based on the People's Representatives Consultative Committee from all walks of life and widely absorbed people from all walks of life to participate. At the sales committee, the specific subscription figures for all sectors were allocated based on the principles of democracy, voluntariness, self-reporting, and public discussion. Because of the wide representation of the committee and the full democratic discussion at the meeting, the allocation figures were fair and reasonable. At the same time, sales committees and sales groups were established separately in various districts and among the people from all walks of life, so that the sales work could be carried out universally and in depth. Thirdly, the principle of lighter burden for workers than businesses, larger contributions from large households, and smaller contributions from small households was adopted in the sales process, which won the unanimous support of the business community. Therefore, all industries smoothly completed their assigned tasks.

    张市职工带头工商界积极行动
    推销公债任务超额完成
    顺利完成的原因：一、宣传普遍深入；二、推销委员会广泛吸收各界人士参加，经过民主讨论，分配数字合理；三、采取工轻于商、大户多出、小户少出的原则。
    【本报张家口讯】中央人民政府发行胜利公债的决定公布后，张市各界即以最大热情踊跃认购、购买，截至十七日止，公营工厂职工认购及购买胜利公债一万三千一百零七分，省市机关部队贸易银行部门干部职员，认购与购买七千九百二十三分，一、二、三区殷实富户认购六万四千四百九十分，私营工商业认购十三万七千七百八十三分，小商认购一千二百分，上述各项总计张市各界已购买与认购二十二万四千五百零三分，胜利完成预定推销任务，并超过四千五百零三分。
                                            （丁原）
    【新华社张家口十八日电】张家口市二十二万分胜利折实公债的推销任务已基本完成。自人民公债决定发行的消息传来后，张市职工、干部即纷纷预购。邮工苏毅以其一月薪金的百分之八十购买公债。张垣机器厂四百余员工平均每人买了三分。铁路工人李万寿一人买了十分。各机关供给制干部也每人至少买了一分。市政府一百二十余人即预购了二百六十五分。公债正式发行后，他们更踊跃购买，五天内即购去八千八百余分。在工人们带头购买的影响下，张市工商界亦于十二日开始行动起来。通过自报公议的方式，全市五十二行业先后认购达十一万九千八百二十八分，超过原定任务二千多分。各区殷实富户与一般市民认购亦达六万四千四百九十分。截至十五日止，全市已购和认购公债总数已达二十一万五千九百余分，距察哈尔省统一分配于本市二十二万分的任务仅差四千分左右，估计数日内即可全部完成。
    此次张市公债推销工作之所以如此顺利，首先是由于进行了普遍而深入的宣传教育工作。除了通过报纸、广播电台及电影院的幻灯片进行宣传外，去年十二月下旬召开的各界代表会并作出号召全市人民踊跃认购公债的决议，由各界代表在会后深入宣传、劝购。其次，张市的公债推销委员会以各界人民代表会协商委员会为基础，广泛吸收了各界人士参加。在推销委员会上依据民主、自愿、自报公议的原则，具体分配各界认购数字。由于委员会代表的广泛性以及会上充分进行民主讨论，使分配数字做到公平合理。同时，在各区及各界人民中又分别建立了推销委员会及推销小组，使推销工作能普遍深入展开。第三，在推销中采取工轻于商、大户多出、小户少出的原则，获得了工商界的一致拥护，因此各行业都顺利完成了分配任务。
