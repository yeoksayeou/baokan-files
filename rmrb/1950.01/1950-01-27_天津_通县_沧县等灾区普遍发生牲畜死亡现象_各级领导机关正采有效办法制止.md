    Widespread Livestock Deaths Occurring in Disaster Areas Such as Tianjin, Tongxian, and Cangxian;
    Leadership at All Levels is Adopting Effective Measures to Stop It
    [Our Newspaper] In disaster areas such as Tianjin, Tongxian, and Cangxian in Hebei Province, the starvation and disease-related deaths of draught animals are widespread. This problem, which seriously affects spring plowing production for farmers, has attracted the attention of leadership at all levels, and effective measures are being taken to stop it. According to statistics from some counties in the Tongxian and Cangxian special districts of Hebei Province, more than a thousand draught animals have died from starvation and disease. Similar phenomena have also occurred in the Tianjin and Handan-Baoding special districts. The main reason for the large number of draught animal deaths is that the leadership at all levels in various regions only have plans and calls to action regarding the protection of draught animals in disaster areas, but lack specific organization for draught animals in disaster areas to participate in transportation production and organization of the masses to carry out communal feeding. Some disaster areas still have draught animals that have not been distributed during the land reform, which are used by the masses in rotation, leading to poor feeding and death. However, some areas, due to the early attention of the leadership, have come up with practical methods to prevent the death of draught animals. For example, in Chengguan District of Huanghua County, Cangxian Special District, 209 carts were organized to transport local products, allowing the draught animals to obtain forage and also solving the livelihood problems of some disaster victims. In Gaoyang County, Baoding Special District, mobilizing the masses to transport grain has also yielded good results. Currently, cadres from governments at all levels in Tianjin, Tongxian, and Cangxian special districts are drawing on the experiences of Huanghua and Gaoyang, and have gone deep into the disaster areas to conduct inspections, and are taking the following methods to solve the problem of draught animals in disaster areas: (1) Help disaster victims use draught animals to organize transportation and other production, or organize disaster victims and relatives and friends in non-disaster areas to feed and use draught animals communally. (2) Draught animals that have not been distributed after the land reform will be distributed quickly. Draught animals that are truly unable to be raised will be sold to non-disaster areas in a planned manner.

    天津  通县  沧县等灾区普遍发生牲畜死亡现象
    各级领导机关正采有效办法制止
    【本报讯】河北省天津、通县、沧县等灾区普遍发生耕畜饿死、病死现象。这一严重影响农民春耕生产的问题，已引起各级领导机关的重视，正采取有效办法制止。据河北省通县专区和沧县专区部分县份统计，因饿因病死亡的耕畜已达千头以上，天津专区和邯郸保定专区亦有类似现象发生。造成耕畜大量死亡的主要原因是各地领导机关对保护灾区耕畜的工作只有计划与号召，缺乏具体的组织灾区耕畜参加运输生产和组织群众进行伙养的工作。有的灾区至今仍有在土地改革中未分配的耕畜，让群众轮流使用，喂养不好而致死亡。但有些地区由于领导机关的及早注意，想出了切实的办法，使耕畜免于死亡。如沧县专区黄骅县城关区，组织了二百零九辆大车，运输土产，使耕畜得到草料，也解决了一部分灾民的生活问题。保定专区高阳县发动群众运粮，也收到好的效果。现天津、通县、沧县等专区各级政府干部根据黄骅、高阳的经验，已深入灾区进行检查，并采取下述方法解决灾区耕畜问题：（一）帮助灾民利用耕畜组织运输及其他生产，或组织灾民与非灾区亲友对耕畜伙养伙用。（二）土地改革后尚未分配的耕畜即迅速分配，对实在无力养用的耕畜，则有计划地卖给非灾区。
