    Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher Case
    Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher, from Oklahoma, USA, applied to the University of Oklahoma's law school after graduating from a specialized school, hoping to become a lawyer. However, her request was denied.
    Thus arose the "Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher Case"—another powerful shattering of the lie propagated by the champions of the "American way of life" regarding so-called "equal educational opportunities."
    Three years have passed since Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher submitted her request to the University of Oklahoma. But she remains as far from her goal as she was at the beginning, even though her complaint has been sent not only to the state court but also to the U.S. Supreme Court.
    When this "case" was being heard in Washington, Judge Jackson pointed out, "She'll be an old woman before she becomes a lawyer."
    What is the reason for Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher's misfortune? Why are the university gates closed to her? The reason is simply that this young woman was "unfortunate" enough to be born into a black family. Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher studied at a black school in her childhood. What use is it that she graduated from elementary school with excellent grades? What use is it that she was at the top of her class in the state's only specialized school for blacks?
    The University of Oklahoma, like most other institutions of higher learning in the United States, is "exclusively for whites."
    The president, advisors, and lecturers all admit that Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher possesses all the qualifications to be admitted to the school; she possesses all the qualifications, except for one thing—white skin.

    阿达·西普爱尔案件
    阿达·西普爱尔，美国奥克拉霍姆州人，自专科学校毕业后，即请求入奥克拉霍姆大学的法律系，她想成为一个律师。然而她的请求被拒绝了。
    于是产生了“阿达·西普爱尔案件”——“美国生活方式”的宣传家所谓“教育机会均等”一类谎言又一有力地被粉碎了。
    自阿达·西普爱尔向奥克拉霍姆大学提出请求书起，迄今已三年了。但她现在仍和当初一样，距离自己的目的尚远，虽然她的控诉状不但已送入该州法院，而且送上美国最高法院了。
    当这“案件”在华盛顿审理时，法官杰克逊指出说：“在她没有成为律师之前，先成了老太婆了。”
    阿达·西普爱尔的不幸遭遇，原因何在呢？为什么大学的校门对她紧闭着？原因只是：这位女郎“不幸”生在黑人的家庭里。幼年时候阿达·西普爱尔在黑人学校里读书。她虽然成绩优越地读毕了小学，那有什么用呢？她虽然在该州黑人的唯一专科学校中名列前茅，那有什么用呢？
    奥克拉霍大学，正像大多数美国其他高等学府一样，是“专为白人”而设的。
    校长、顾问、讲师全都承认，阿达·西普爱尔具备一切资格，可以取得该校的学籍，她一切资格都具备，只是缺少一样——白色皮肤。
