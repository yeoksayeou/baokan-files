Hebei and Jiangxi Plant Early-Maturing Crops

Pay Attention to Grasping Seasonality and Timely Resolution of Seed and Livestock Problems

Cadres of Tianjin Prefecture Arrive in Heavily Affected Areas to Work

[Report from this newspaper in Baoding] Hebei Province disaster areas are now preparing to plant large quantities of early-maturing crops to shorten the spring famine. Last autumn, the province's disaster areas planted 12,730,000 mu of wheat. According to the existing number of bare land and the number of mu that may be drained and released this spring, the province plans to plant 7,700,000 mu of early-maturing crops such as spring wheat, barley, and peas. Regarding the seed issue, in addition to mobilizing the masses to freely lend and borrow, the Hebei Provincial People's Government plans to lend out 6,570,000 jin of various seeds to disaster victims who are truly unable to prepare seeds. Currently, Tianjin Prefecture has begun investigating loan recipients and is transferring seeds. Gaoyang County and district cadres in Baoding Prefecture are mobilizing the masses to carry out free lending. The county's supply and marketing cooperative is purchasing various early-maturing seeds at various market towns, and it is estimated that 250,000 jin can be purchased. In order to ensure the successful completion of spring wheat planting in disaster areas, the Hebei Provincial Government issued instructions to governments at all levels, stipulating that spring wheat loans must be delivered to disaster victims before the Spring Festival.

Hebei Prepares to Plant 7 Million Mu of Spring Wheat; Winter Crops in Jiangxi Have All Sprouted

[Report from this newspaper] Last November, the Central Plains Provisional People's Government lent 1,500,000 jin of wheat seeds to disaster areas along the Gan River and Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province. After the disaster victims obtained the wheat seeds, their enthusiasm for winter cultivation greatly increased. Farmers in the first and fourth districts of Jiujiang County planted more than 26,000 mu of wheat, peas, and vegetables, and it is estimated that each mu can produce an average of eight dou of miscellaneous grains, and at least 20,000 dan or more can be harvested this spring. The first and second districts of Xinjian County planted 19,956 mu of winter crops. The fifth district of Nanchang planted a total of 8,186 mu of winter crops. Farmers in the fourth district planted all 7,400 jin of wheat seeds they had borrowed. In Yugan County, Erdu Township alone planted 916 mu. During winter cultivation and planting, in order to solve the difficulty of farmers lacking ploughing cattle, local governments not only lent ploughing cattle to farmers who had no cattle to plough their land, but also organized farmers to help each other by exchanging manual labor for cattle labor. Farmers in Baotong Township and Nanhu Township in Yongxiu County used the thousand or so shi of grain they had obtained in the rent reduction movement to buy ploughing cattle for production. Currently, all the winter crops planted in various places have sprouted, and farmers are actively applying fertilizer.

[Another dispatch] The masses in various parts of Hunan are actively carrying out production and preparing for the spring famine, preparing for spring ploughing. Due to the long-term destruction by the Kuomintang bandits and years of drought and flood disasters, the province suffered a fairly serious disaster last year. In Changsha Prefecture alone, the affected population reached 620,000, of which 160,000 are currently unable to live. Last autumn, under the leadership of the People's Government, the production movement gradually unfolded, and the winter cultivation area in many areas exceeded that of last year. For example, Changsha and Xiangtan counties cultivated more than 3.3 million mu of winter land, accounting for more than 70% of the arable land in the two counties. Pingjiang cultivated 262,500 mu of winter land, an increase of 100% over the winter cultivation area in previous years. Most of the land that has undergone winter cultivation has now been planted with crops such as wheat, broad beans, peas, rapeseed, and potatoes.

The dike repair project in various counties along Dongting Lake began successively in mid-December last year and has now started universally. Due to the adoption of the reasonable method of "owners pay the money, farmers contribute the labor", the masses are very enthusiastic about participating in dike repair. Yiyang, Hanshou, and Yuanjiang counties have more dike breaches. The Yiyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office specially issued 3.6 million jin of grain for the project, striving for a swift completion. Nanxian used work relief, mobilizing more than 19,000 laborers to participate in dike repair, solving the lives of most of the disaster victims.

[Report from this newspaper] Li Kecai, Deputy Commissioner of the Tianjin Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Hebei Province, and Zhu Kang, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Prefectural Committee, have led 220 cadres to Ninghe and Baodi counties, and in conjunction with the local government and party committee, they have organized the Ningbao Disaster Area Work Committee to specifically lead the disaster victims in production and disaster relief work; Li Kecai and others have also brought 5.6 million jin of grain (mainly used to purchase disaster victims' products and support transportation), 100,000 jin of cotton, and 80,000 jin of bran. The Prefectural Commissioner's Office also sent eight doctors, carrying medical expenses (equivalent to 10,000 jin of rice), to the disaster area to lead the local medical associations and provide emergency treatment to disaster victims who are sick due to poor living conditions. The Central Jiyun River Paddy Field Irrigation Office plans to repair the aqueducts after the Lunar New Year, preparing to use 20 million jin of grain for construction. Ninghe County is discussing with the office, preparing to use work relief to be responsible for introducing migrant workers. The county has generally launched disaster victims to spin thread in the heavily affected areas. The county supply and marketing cooperative has allocated 15,000 jin of cotton to the third district for disaster victims to weave. In order to solve the difficulty of disaster victims burning firewood, the county is lending a large amount of coal to disaster victims.

Visiting Door-to-Door to Find Production Opportunities

[Report from this newspaper] County and district cadres go deep into the disaster areas, helping disaster victims door-to-door to find production opportunities. This is one of the important methods for leading disaster victims to produce and overcome famine. The leading cadres of Wuqing and Anci counties and districts in Hebei Province held meetings to review and criticize the bureaucratic style of leadership in production and disaster relief, and determined to go deep into the masses and specifically help disaster victims in production. More than 20 major cadres in Wuqing County immediately went to the three heavily affected areas of the second, seventh, and fourteenth districts to investigate the situation of the disaster victims door-to-door (such as what they can do, what difficulties they have, and what help they need), and specifically organized and helped them; After more than 20 days of efforts, great results have been achieved. Sixty-four heavily affected villages at the junction of the three districts have started fish farming production, solving the living problems of some disaster victims. In order to vigorously support disaster victims in spinning thread, weaving cloth, and weaving mats, the county supply and marketing cooperative and the bank branch lent 300,000 jin of mat reeds and 370 foreign yarns. In 62 villages, 1,223 women have participated in spinning and weaving. There were originally 30 disaster victim households in Damafang Village in the fourth district who weaved colanders, but they later collapsed due to the small output and low profits (earning only 100 yuan for weaving one). Meng Qinglin, deputy secretary of the district party committee, personally went to lead and study the weaving method, and now each person has increased from weaving 15 a day to weaving 20 to 30. The district cadres of the sixth district learned the method of fish farming from the fishermen of Wuqing County, and then convened a meeting of cadres from several villages to introduce the method to them, and each village went to fish farming after learning it.

    领导人民生产战胜春荒
    河北江西播种早熟作物
    注意掌握季节性及时解决种籽牲畜问题
    天津专区干部已抵重灾区工作
    【本报保定讯】河北省灾区现正准备大量播种早熟作物，以缩短春荒。去秋全省灾区已种小麦一千二百七十三万亩，根据现有白地数字及今春可能排水脱出的地亩数字，全省计划种春麦、大麦、豌豆等早熟作物七百七十万亩。关于种籽问题，除发动群众自由借贷外，河北省人民政府计划贷出各样种籽六百五十七万斤。借给确实无法筹备种籽的灾民。现天津专区已开始调查贷种对象，并正调运籽种。保定专区高阳县、区干部正发动群众开展自由借贷。该县供销社在各集镇换购各种早熟籽种，预计可收购到二十五万斤。为使灾区春麦播种胜利完成，河北省府向各级人民政府发出指示，规定春麦贷种必须于春节前贷到灾民手中。
    河北准备播种春麦七百万亩  江西冬季作物已全部发芽
    【本报讯】去年十一月中原临时人民政府贷给江西省沿赣江、鄱阳湖灾区麦种一百五十万斤，各地灾民获得麦种后，冬耕情绪大为提高。九江县一、四区农民播种麦子、豌豆、蔬菜等二万六千多亩，预计每亩平均可产八斗杂粮，今春至少可收二万担以上。新建县一、二区种植冬季作物一万九千九百五十六亩。南昌五区共种植冬季作物八千一百八十六亩。四区农民将所贷到的七千四百斤麦种全部播种。余干县仅二都乡即播种了九百一十六亩。冬耕冬种中，各地政府为解决农民缺乏耕牛的困难，除借贷耕牛给无牛耕种土地的农民外，同时组织农民以人工换牛工进行互助。永修县抱桐乡、南湖乡农民将在减租运动中所获得的千余石谷子买了耕牛进行生产。现各地所播种之冬季作物，已全部发芽，农民正在积极施肥。
    【又讯】湖南各地群众正积极进行生产备荒，准备春耕。由于国民党匪帮的长期破坏及连年水旱天灾，该省去年灾荒相当严重，仅长沙专区一地受灾人口即达六十二万，其中有十六万人目前即无法生活。去秋在人民政府领导下，生产运动已逐步展开，许多地区冬耕面积已超过去年，如长沙、湘潭两县即冬耕三百三十余万亩，占两县可耕地百分之七十以上，平江冬耕二十六万二千五百余亩，比往年冬耕面积增加一倍。经过冬耕的土地，现大部均已种上小麦、蚕豆、豌豆、油菜、马铃薯等作物。
    沿洞庭湖各县修堤工程自去年十二月中旬陆续开始，现已普遍动工。由于采取“业主出钱，农民出力”的合理办法，群众参加修堤非常踊跃。益阳、汉寿、沅江三县溃垸较多，益阳专署特发工程贷粮三百六十万斤，争取迅速完工。南县以工代赈，动员民工一万九千余人参加修堤，解决了大部分灾民生活。
    【本报讯】河北省天津专署副专员李克才、中共地委副书记朱康已带领二百二十名干部赴宁河、宝坻二县，结合当地政府、党委组织了宁宝灾区工作委员会，专门领导灾民生产救灾工作；李克才等并携带粮食五百六十万斤（主要用于收购灾民生产品和支持运输）、皮棉十万斤、糠八万斤。专署并派出医生八名，携带药费（合米一万斤），赴灾区带动当地医联会，急救因生活不好而患病的灾民。中央蓟运河稻田灌溉处计划于旧历年后修治水渠，准备用二千万斤粮食施工，宁河县正与该处商量，准备用以工代赈的方式，负责介绍民工。该县已在重灾区普遍发动灾民纺线，县供销社已拨给三区一万五千斤棉花，供灾民纺织之用。为解决灾民烧柴困难，该县正大量向灾民贷煤。
    逐户访问找生产门路
    【本报讯】县区干部深入灾区，逐户帮助灾民想出生产门路，这是领导灾民生产渡荒的重要方法之一。河北省武清、安次县区领导干部曾分别集会检讨批判了对生产救灾领导的官僚主义作风，决心深入群众，具体帮助灾民生产。武清县二十多个主要干部，立刻分赴二、七、十四等三个重灾区，挨门挨户调查灾民的情况（如会作什么，有何困难，需要什么帮助），具体进行组织帮助；经过二十多天的努力，已获得很大成绩。三个区接合部的六十四个重灾村，已搞起了治鱼生产，解决了部分灾民生活问题。该县供销社和银行支行为大力扶持灾民纺线、织布、织席，曾贷发了三十万斤席苇，三百七十块洋纱。六十二个村中已有一千二百二十三名妇女参加纺织。四区大马房村原有三十户灾民编笊篱的，因出品量少利薄（编一个只赚一百元）后来垮台，该区区委副书记孟庆林便亲自去领导研究编法，现每人已由每天编十五个增到编二三十个。六区区干向武清县渔民学了治鱼办法，即召集几个村的干部开会，把方法介绍给他们，各村学会了都去治鱼。
