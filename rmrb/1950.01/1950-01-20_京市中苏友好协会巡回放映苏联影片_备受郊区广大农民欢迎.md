    Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's Mobile Film Screenings
    Widely Welcomed by Farmers in the Suburbs
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's mobile screenings of Soviet films in the suburbs have been warmly welcomed by workers and farmers. To promote its work in the suburbs, the association took advantage of the slack farming season and, from the 8th to the 17th of this month, screened Soviet newsreels on collective farms and science and technology, as well as films such as "The Defense of Stalingrad," "Son of the Regiment," and "Returning to Their Own Ranks," in the 13th district of Beijing's suburbs. Approximately two thousand viewers attended each day. Farmers in various villages undergoing land reform were greatly interested in the Soviet collective farm and science and technology newsreels. Many said after watching them: This is a good example for us in the future. Now that we are implementing land reform and completely eliminating feudal forces, we must learn from the Soviet Union and develop our agricultural production! They also requested to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The association will continue its mobile screenings in various villages in the 16th district starting from the 18th, and will also hold a mobile exhibition of Soviet collective farm and scientific hygiene pictures in the 13th district. It is also scheduled to conduct mobile film screenings in units such as the Shijingshan Power Plant, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the People's Printing Factory of China, the Beijing Clothing Factory, and the 70th Ordnance Factory within days.
