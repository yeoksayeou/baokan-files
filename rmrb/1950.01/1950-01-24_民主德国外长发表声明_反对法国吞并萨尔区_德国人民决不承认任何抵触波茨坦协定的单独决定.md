Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 21st (TASS dispatch): Georg Dertinger, Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, recently made a statement on behalf of the government at the plenary session of the Provisional People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic regarding the French annexation of the Saar region.

	Dertinger pointed out that the ultimate goal of French Foreign Minister Schuman's visit to West Germany was certainly to make West Germany serve the Atlantic Pact. Referring to the negotiations Schuman conducted with Adenauer in Bonn, he said: "Having offered the Ruhr region to the Western countries by signing the Petersberg Agreement, Adenauer now expresses his willingness to cede the Saar region as well. Schuman's visit to West Germany is clearly paving the way for the annexation of the Saar, an action that violates international law and is spurned by all the German people."

	Dertinger stated that the Potsdam Agreement did not stipulate the cession of the Saar region, and it is France's obligation to fulfill this agreement. However, in 1947, the three Western countries concluded a secret agreement on the political separation of the Saar region from Germany and its economic integration into France. When the German Democratic Republic was founded, Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic stated that the Republic's government recognized the joint decisions of the four occupying powers. However, we will never recognize unilateral decisions that violate international law; such decisions must be considered invalid.

	Dertinger continued: The German Democratic Republic pursues an honest policy of peace and friendly cooperation with all countries, especially our neighbors. This also applies to relations with the French people. However, the policy pursued by the French government in West Germany, under the leadership of the British and American forces currently controlling West Germany, is to make militarist forces the dominant force in West Germany once again. The policy of Democratic Germany, on the other hand, is to try to completely isolate all forces in Germany that are interested in war. The road to peace and security in Western Europe is not through cartel agreements of trusts and monopolies, nor through dividing German territory and making these territories participate in Western military pacts, or organizing mercenary armies to prepare for a new world war. The road to peace and security is the major powers concluding a treaty to strengthen peace, as suggested by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky at the United Nations General Assembly, restoring German national unity on a democratic basis, all peace-loving people forming an alliance, and implementing a policy of genuine and friendly cooperation.

	Foreign Minister Dertinger concluded by pointing out that the German people will not agree to the annexation of the Saar region. Nor do they intend to render any service to the strategists of the "Cold War" and the Atlantic Pact. The adventurous plans of reactionary and imperialist forces will be met with the growing strength of the National Front of Democratic Germany. Only a democratic, peace-loving, and independent Germany built by the National Front composed of Germany's true patriots can guarantee the security and peace of the French people's western border, and only such a Germany can contribute to the establishment of European peace and to the cause of post-war reconstruction.

### 民主德国外长发表声明  反对法国吞并萨尔区  德国人民决不承认任何抵触波茨坦协定的单独决定

    民主德国外长发表声明
    反对法国吞并萨尔区
    德国人民决不承认任何抵触波茨坦协定的单独决定
    【新华社北京二十三日电】塔斯社柏林二十一日讯：德意志民主共和国外交部长乔治·窦丁格尔，顷在德意志民主共和国临时人民议会的全体会议上，代表政府就法国并吞萨尔区事发表声明。
    窦丁格尔指出：法国外交部长舒曼这次西德之行，其最后目的一定是使西德为大西洋公约服务。他谈到舒曼在波恩与阿登纳所进行的谈判称：“由于签署了彼得斯堡协定，阿登纳把鲁尔区奉送给西方国家，现在他又表示还情愿割让萨尔区。舒曼的访问西德，显然为吞并萨尔铺平道路，这一行动抵触国际法，而且为全德国人民所唾弃。”
    窦丁格尔称，波茨坦协定并未规定割让萨尔区，履行这个协定是法国的义务。但在一九四七年，三个西方国家对萨尔区在政治上与德国脱离、在经济上并入法国一事，缔结了秘密协定。德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在德意志民主共和国成立时所发表的声明曾指出，共和国政府承认四占领国家的联合决定。但我们永不承认抵触国际法的单独决定，这种决定必须被认为无效。
    窦丁格尔继称：德意志民主共和国奉行和平及与一切国家，特别是我们邻邦友好合作的诚实政策。这也适用于和法国人民的关系。但法政府在目前控制西德的英美力量领导之下，在西德所遵循的政策，却是使军国主义势力再次成为西德的支配力量。而民主德国的政策则是要设法完全孤立德国的一切对战争感到兴趣的力量。西欧的和平与安全的道路不是托辣斯与独占企业的卡迭尔协定，不是分割德国领土和使这些领土参加西方军事公约，或者组织雇佣军准备打新的世界大战。和平与安全的道路是苏联外长维辛斯基在联合国大会上所建议的各大国缔结加强和平公约，在民主基础上恢复德国国家统一，一切爱好和平的人民结成同盟和执行真正友好的合作政策。
    窦丁格尔外长最后指出：德国人民不会同意萨尔区被吞并。他们也不打算对“冷战”与大西洋公约的战略家作任何服务。反动力量与帝国主义力量的冒险计划，将遇到民主德国的全国阵线的正在生长中的力量。只有德国的真正爱国志士组成的全国阵线所建立的民主的、爱好和平的与独立的德国，才能保障法国人民西部边界上的安全与和平，只有这样的德国才能对欧洲和平的建立，对战后重建的事业有所贡献。
