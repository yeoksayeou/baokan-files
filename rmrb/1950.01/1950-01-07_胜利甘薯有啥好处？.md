What are the Benefits of Victory Sweet Potatoes?
	Gao Zhulin

	I. High Yield: According to the experimental records of the Changli Railway Farm since 1942, the average yield of Victory Sweet Potatoes (i.e., Okinawa No. 100) is 3,300 jin per mu. In 1947, the highest yield per mu reached 6,700 jin, and the lowest was 2,500 jin. This year, although there was continuous rain damage, resulting in reduced production, the highest harvest reached 4,000 jin, with an average of about 2,000 jin. As for those planted by farmers, some yielded 4,000 to 5,000 jin per mu, and those implementing vegetable garden rotation yielded more than 10,000 jin. In the Changli area of eastern Hebei, an average yield of 3,000 jin per mu is common. This year, local sweet potatoes only yielded 1,300 jin per mu, while Okinawa No. 100 yielded more than twice as much.

	II. Labor-Saving Cultivation: The seedlings of Victory Sweet Potatoes have drought resistance and are relatively easy to plant and survive in dry springs (without the trouble of replanting due to dryness and missing seedlings). Also, its vines are shorter, making it easier to weed and cultivate, and there is no need to rush to turn the vines after each rain. These two points can save farmers a lot of labor.

	III. Early Maturity: Local sweet potatoes need about 150 days to mature, while Okinawa No. 100 sweet potatoes can be harvested in just 90 to 120 days. In the Changli experiment, some were harvested in 90 days, and others in 100, 120, and 150 days. The results showed that 100 to 120 days was the best. This advantage is extremely important in agricultural production. Because it requires a short growing period, it is very suitable for planting after the wheat harvest, or for early planting in the spring, so that it can be harvested early in the autumn, after which vegetables can be planted again. On May 7, 1947, the Changli Railway Farm planted Victory Sweet Potatoes and harvested them on August 20 (growing for 103 days). On August 22nd and 23rd, autumn cabbage was planted again. As a result, each mu yielded 2,500 jin of sweet potatoes and 3,000 jin of cabbage (this was not a vegetable garden, and the cabbage was not watered).

	IV. Strong Disaster Resistance: Victory Sweet Potatoes have extremely strong resistance or tolerance to natural disasters such as drought, wind, rain, and hail. In dry springs, its seedlings are easy to plant and survive, and it can still grow during relatively long periods of drought. Both the vines above ground and the tubers below ground grow together. This advantage guarantees that even if it encounters disasters within one or two months after planting, it can still get a considerable harvest. Although there is no experimental basis for its resistance to water and excessive rain, judging from the example of Hebei East, which suffered severely from wind and rain disasters this year, it significantly demonstrated its tolerance to rainwater. In areas where the disaster was severe, most of the general crops were not harvested, but some farmers still got a harvest because they planted some sweet potatoes. This year, the sweet potatoes planted by the Changli Railway Farm on high ground generally increased in yield. Although those in low-lying areas suffered some losses due to excessive rain, according to the investigation, more than 20% of the early large tubers rotted during the rainy season, but later, some small tubers were newly grown from the roots and grew very quickly. As a result, each mu still harvested 1,500 to 2,000 jin. In addition, sweet potatoes are very resistant to wind and hail disasters because their vines lie flat on the ground and are not easily damaged.

	V. Wide Adaptability:

	1. Adaptation to Time: In eastern Hebei, the planting period of Victory Sweet Potatoes is from May 1st to the end of July. Early and late planting are both acceptable. In central and southern Hebei Province or central and southern China, the climate is warmer, and the planting period can be advanced, and the harvest period can be delayed. Adaptation to time enables farmers to allocate work calmly, without the concern of having to rush to plant and harvest and squeezing the work together during the busy spring planting or autumn harvest season.

	2. Adaptation to Soil: Well-drained sandy loam is most suitable for planting sweet potatoes, but sticky clay, loose sandy soil, or barren gravelly soil, as long as it is not a field that is constantly flooded, can also yield a good harvest when planting sweet potatoes, which is higher than the harvest of ordinary crops.

	3. Adaptation to Terrain: Well-drained fertile plains are the ideal land for planting sweet potatoes; however, multiple trials have also been conducted on terraced fields on mountain slopes, with excellent harvests. In addition, sweet potatoes can also be planted on hills, sandy mounds, dikes, riverbanks, long-abandoned cultivated land, or newly reclaimed raw land.

	4. Adaptation to Region and Climate: In terms of China's region, from the hot Pearl River Basin in the south to the bitterly cold Northeast Plain in the north, from the rainy coastal areas in the southeast to southern Chahar in the northwest, wherever other crops can grow, the growing season is extended to about 100 days, and the temperature is between 20 and 35 degrees Celsius, sweet potatoes can be planted. In the future, Victory Sweet Potatoes can be tried and promoted in northwestern Chahar, Suiyuan, Baotou, Ningxia, and other places.

	VI. Multiple Uses: Victory Sweet Potatoes have low water content and high powder content, a high drying rate, and are very suitable for farmers' sideline flour production. They are also the main or auxiliary raw materials for many industrial products, such as maltose, sugar, monosodium glutamate, powdered soy sauce, vinegar, and brandy and whiskey for drinking; tooth powder, prickly heat powder, face powder, laundry paste, textile paste, and dextrin for household use, and more than 150 other items. In addition, glucose, plasters, blood-tonifying and strengthening agents, surgical agents, ether, acetic acid, and vitamin C for medicinal use; alcohol for chemical and power use; explosives for military use; dry batteries, paint and dye solvents, oil decomposing agents, artificial pearls, and various films and fake paints for industrial use can all be made from sweet potatoes.

    胜利甘薯有啥好处？
    高竹林
    一、产量大：据昌黎铁路农场由民国三十一年以来的试验记录，胜利甘薯（即冲绳百号）每亩的平均产量是三千三百市斤。在民国三十六年每亩最高的产量到过六千七百市斤，最低二千五百市斤。今年虽有霪雨为灾，致产量减低，但最高的收获达到四千市斤，平均二千市斤左右。至于农家栽植的，有的每亩产四、五千斤，实行菜园轮作的，有的产到一万余斤。在滦东昌黎地区的平均产量三千市斤是常见的。本年本地甘薯每亩只产一千三百市斤，冲绳百号产量超过一倍以上。
    二、栽培省工：胜利甘薯的幼苗具有耐旱能力，在缺雨的春天也比较容易栽活（没有干枯缺苗必须补栽的麻烦）。还有它的蔓秧长得较短，便于锄草和中耕等工作，更不必在每次下雨之后，即须抢着翻蔓。这两点可以节省农家很多的劳力。
    三、成熟早：本地甘薯须一百五十日左右方能成熟，冲绳百号甘薯只需九十日至一百二十日即可收获。在昌黎实验结果，有九十日收获的，也有一百日，一百二十日和一百五十日收获的，结果以一百日至一百二十日为最佳。这个优点，在农业生产上极为重要。因为它所需要的生长期短，极适于麦收后的栽植，或在春季早栽，秋季即可早收，收后可再种植蔬菜。昌黎铁路农场，在民国三十六年五月七日栽的胜利甘薯于八月二十日收获（生长一百零三日）以后，在八月二十二、三两天又栽植了秋白菜。结果每亩收了甘薯二千五百市斤，又收大白菜三千市斤（这不是菜园地，白菜没浇过水）。
    四、抗灾性强：胜利甘薯对于干旱风雨冰雹等自然灾害，均具有极强的抵抗性或忍耐性。在干旱的春季，它的幼苗易于栽活，在相当长久的干旱期间仍可生长，他是地上的蔓秧和地下的块根一齐生长，这一个优点，保证了它在栽后一两个月内即使遇到灾害，仍能得到相当的收获。它对于水和多雨的抵抗力虽无实验作根据，但就本年受风雨灾害惨重的冀东栽培实例来看，它显著的表现了对于雨水的忍耐性。在灾情严重的地方，一般的作物大部没有收获，但有些农家，因栽植一些甘薯而仍得到收获。今年昌黎铁路农场在高地栽植的甘薯，产量均普遍的增加，在洼地的虽因雨水过多而受到一些损失，据调查，早生的大形块根在雨期烂了百分之二十以上，但以后又从根旁新生了一些小形的块根，并且长得很快，结果每亩仍收获一千五百至二千余斤。此外，甘薯对于风雹灾害的抵抗很强，因它的蔓秧平生地面，不易受到侵害。
            五、适应性广：
    １、对于时间的适应：胜利甘薯的栽植时期，在冀东方面由五月一日起至七月底止，早栽晚栽均可。河北省中南部或华中华南等地，气候较暖，栽植时期可以提早，收获时期可以拖延。对时期的适应，能使农家从容分配工作，在春忙播种或秋收季节，没有必须抢种抢收将工作挤在一起的顾虑。
    ２、对于土壤的适应：排水良好的沙质壤土，最适于栽植甘薯，但粘性的泥土，松疏的沙土或硗瘠的砾土，只要不是经常积水的田地，栽植甘薯亦能得到良好的收获，比种植普通作物的收获为高。
    ３、对于地势的适应：排水良好的平原沃壤，是最理想的栽甘薯的田地；但在山坡上的梯田里，也曾多次试验，得到极佳的收获。此外丘陵沙阜，堤岸河边，多年废弃的耕田，或新开垦的生地，也可以栽植甘薯。
    ４、对于地区和气候的适应：就我国地区来说，南起炎热的珠江流域，北至严寒的东北平原，东南自沿海多雨地带，西北至察南，凡是能生长其他作物，生长期延长到一百日左右，气温在摄氏二十至三十五度的地区，都能栽植甘薯。今后可在西北察绥包头宁夏等地试行推广胜利甘薯。
    六、用途繁多：胜利甘薯含水少，含粉多，晒干率大，极适于农家副业制粉之用。又是众多工业品的主要或辅佐原料。如调味用的饴、糖、味精、粉末酱油、醋饮酌用的白兰地、威士忌、合成酒；家庭用的牙粉、痱子粉、扑粉、洗濯糊、纺织糊、糊精等一百五十余种物品。此外医药用的葡萄糖、膏药、补血强壮剂、外科用剂、醚、醋酸及丙种维他命；化学用和动力用的酒精；军需用的爆炸药；及工业用的干电池，涂料及染料之溶剂，油脂分解剂，人造珍珠，及各种Film（胶板）和假漆等等均可用甘薯制造。
