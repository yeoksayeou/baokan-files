Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: TASS, Ulaanbaatar - The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party began its plenary session on January 25th. The agenda included two reports: the achievements of the Mongolian People's Republic in developing animal husbandry in 1949 and the tasks for 1950 (reported by Prime Minister Marshal Choibalsan), and the situation of the Party's mass political work among the masses and the tasks for its improvement (reported by Tsendenbal, General Secretary of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party).

In his report, Marshal Choibalsan pointed out that the total number of livestock of all kinds in the Republic increased by 1,345,822 head last year. State-owned farms have exceeded the state plan for increasing various livestock by 12 percent last year, and production cooperatives have exceeded it by 40 percent. The number of domestic production cooperatives is increasing every year, and there are now a total of 121 production cooperatives. Choibalsan particularly emphasized that a broad prospect has unfolded before the cooperatives regarding the reorganization of Mongolia's scattered, small-scale animal husbandry. Our current task is to consolidate the existing production cooperatives organizationally and economically and make them model enterprises. The Party Central Committee and the government are currently drafting plans and will definitely take concrete measures to consolidate production cooperatives organizationally and economically.

Choibalsan then discussed the plan for developing animal husbandry this year. This plan stipulates that the country should increase its livestock by 1,539,000 head within one year. Choibalsan pointed out that, as proven by the experience of advanced livestock breeders and the work of certain livestock farms, all possibilities for developing animal husbandry have not yet been fully utilized. Therefore, the adopted plan can not only be completed but also exceeded. The reporter emphasized the importance of striving to increase long-horned cattle.

Choibalsan suggested taking a number of measures to improve the foundation of feed, including sowing drought-resistant pasture and greatly increasing the storage of hay for winter use. He also suggested paying special attention to building new wells and better protecting existing wells to ensure the supply of water for pastures. This year's plan stipulates the construction of 4,150 new wells and the repair of 4,200 old wells. The report also paid special attention to further improving veterinary work. When talking about the work of state-owned farms, Choibalsan proposed that state-owned farms should become model enterprises capable of successfully raising highly reproductive livestock within a few years.

    蒙古人民革命党中委会全体会上
    乔巴山元帅报告生产计划
    国营农场增加牲畜超过计划百分之十二
    巩固现有生产合作社并使成为模范企业
    【新华社北京二十九日电】塔斯社乌兰巴托尔讯：蒙古人民革命党中央委员会于一月二十五日开始举行全体例会。议程包括蒙古人民共和国一九四九年发展牲畜饲养业的成绩及一九五○年的任务（报告人总理乔巴山元帅），和党在群众中进行群众政治工作的状况及其改进的任务（报告人蒙古人民革命党总书记泽登巴尔）的两项报告。
    乔巴山元帅在其报告中指出，共和国各种牲畜的总数，在去年已增加了一百三十四万五千八百二十二头。国营农场已超过去年增加各种牲畜的国家计划百分之十二，生产合作社则超过百分之四十。  国内生产合作社的数目每年均在增加，现共有一百二十一个生产合作社。乔巴山特别着重指出：在合作社面前已展开关于改组蒙古分散的小规模牲畜饲养业的广大远景。我们现在的任务，是从组织上、经济上巩固现有的生产合作社，并使之成为模范的企业。党中央委员会和政府现正草拟计划，并且一定会迅速采取从组织上和经济上巩固生产合作社的具体措施。
    乔巴山继论及本年发展牲畜饲养的计划。这一计划规定全国在一年内应增加牲畜一百五十三万九千头。乔巴山指出：正如先进的牲畜饲养者的经验与某些养畜场的工作所证明，发展牲畜饲养的一切可能性还没有加以充分的利用。因此，所通过的计划不仅能完成，并且也能超过。报告人着重指出尽力增加长角牲畜的重要性。
    乔巴山建议采取若干措施，以便改进饲料的基础，这些措施包括播种抗旱牧草及大量增加冬季用的干草的储藏。他又建议特别注意建筑新水井和更好地保护现有的水井，以保证牧场用水的供应。本年计划规定建筑四千一百五十个新水井和重修四千二百个旧水井。报告对进一步改进兽医工作亦予以特别注意。谈到国营农场的工作时，乔巴山提出要使国营农场在几年内成为能胜利地饲养有高度繁殖力的牲畜的模范企业。
