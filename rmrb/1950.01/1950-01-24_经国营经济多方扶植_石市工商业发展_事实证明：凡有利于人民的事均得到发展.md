For example, the electric-powered looms for weaving, which never existed in the past, have now grown to thirty-eight. The output of plain cloth increased from 46,789 bolts at the end of 1948 to 113,805 bolts in 1949.

At the same time, the quantity of material exchanges in the Shijiazhuang market has also expanded significantly over the past year. Taking cotton, grain, and oil as the three major commodities, the amount of cotton entering the market increased from 854,525 jin in January of last year to 1,653,111 jin in November, an increase of more than 90%. Cotton sales in January were 793,756 jin; cotton sales in November were 1,954,514 jin, an increase of more than double. Grain entering the market was 8,597,655 jin in January and 29,265,274 jin in December, an increase of more than double. Grain sales in January were 8,742,646 jin, and grain sales in December were 12,843,778 jin, an increase of more than 50%.
