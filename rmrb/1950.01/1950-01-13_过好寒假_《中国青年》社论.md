Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th. The thirtieth issue of "China Youth," the central organ publication of the New Democratic Youth League of China, features an editorial titled "Spend a Good Winter Vacation," which reads as follows:

    During last year's summer vacation, the education departments of the people's governments, the Youth League committees, and student unions in many cities organized summer learning for students and primary and secondary school teachers, establishing summer youth academies, summer study groups, or similar organizations. Wherever it was done with serious responsibility and leadership, great achievements were made, greatly assisting the ideological transformation of students and teachers and the subsequent development of New Democratic learning. Now that winter vacation is approaching again, we must make good use of this winter vacation in the same way.

        Organize Learning

    During the winter vacation, it is still important to organize learning well. Study the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and New Democratic policies. The Common Program is the crystallization of decades of experience in the Chinese people's democratic revolution, and every article is worth careful study by young people. In cities newly liberated, such as Guangzhou, Guilin, Chongqing, Kunming, and Chengdu, it is possible to organize the study of historical materialism, the basic problems of the Chinese revolution, or various policies of the People's Government, to initially guide students in transforming their thinking and establishing a revolutionary outlook on life.

    When organizing winter vacation learning in various places, you can follow the methods used during the summer vacation, establishing youth academies, study groups, or holding youth lectures, training classes, and clubs. When organizing the study of the Common Program, in addition to using the above methods, you can also refer to the Youth League Central Committee Propaganda Department's instructions and study outlines on this learning (published in "China Youth" issue 27).

        Review and Catch Up on Lessons, Visits and Celebrations, Joyfully Celebrate the Spring Festival

    During the winter vacation, students can also be organized to review and catch up on their lessons. Under the guidance and assistance of school administration and teachers, cultural tutoring classes or study mutual aid groups for reviewing books should be established based on students' willingness and needs. In addition, appropriate visits and beneficial cultural and recreational activities such as movies, dramas, parties, and sports activities can be organized. The winter vacation coincides with the Spring Festival, so everyone can have fun and express the joy of our liberated people and youth as much as possible. Where possible, these activities should be combined with work such as promoting public bonds and supporting the army.

    The winter vacation is much shorter than the summer vacation, so the Youth League in various places should prepare for the work during the winter vacation as early as possible, and obtain the guidance and assistance of local people's government education departments, school administration, and teachers, which is necessary. On the other hand, do not forget that since the winter vacation is very short, do not plan too much work, but should focus on doing things according to the local situation and the needs of the work. The learning courses should not be many, but should have a center. Learning the Common Program should also have a focus and should be related to reality.

### 过好寒假  《中国青年》社论

    过好寒假
    《中国青年》社论
    【新华社北京十二日电】新民主主义青年团中央机关刊物《中国青年》第三十期社论，题为《过好寒假》，文如下：
    去年暑假里，很多城市的人民政府教育机关、青年团团委和学联，都组织了学生和中小学教师的暑期学习，成立了暑期青年学园、暑期学习团，或类似的组织。凡是认真负责有领导地做的地方，都收到很大的成绩，对于学生和教师的思想改造和日后新民主主义学习的开展，都有很大的帮助。现在寒假又快要到了，我们同样地要好好利用这个寒假。
            组织学习
    在寒假里，还是要很好地组织学习。学习人民政协共同纲领，学习新民主主义政策。共同纲领是中国人民民主革命数十年经验的结晶，它的每一项条文，都值得青年们仔细研读的。在广州、桂林、重庆、昆明、成都等解放不久的城市中，则可以组织学习唯物史观、中国革命的基本问题、或人民政府的各项政策等，初步引导学生们改造思想，建立革命的人生观。
    各地组织寒假学习时，可以仿照暑假时的办法，成立青年学园、学习团，或举办青年讲座、训练班、俱乐部等。组织关于共同纲领的学习时，除了采用上述办法外，还可以参考青年团中央宣传部关于这一学习的指示及学习提纲（载《中国青年》第二十七期）。
            温课补课  参观访问  欢度春节
    寒假期间，也可以组织同学们温习及补习功课。应当在学校行政和教师的指导与帮助之下，根据同学的自愿和需要，成立文化补习班或温书的学习互助小组。此外，还可以适当地组织参观访问及电影、戏剧、晚会、体育活动等有益身心的文化娱乐活动。寒假正赶上春节，大家可以尽兴地玩一玩，尽量表示我们翻身的人民和青年的欢乐。在可能的条件下，这些活动应当和推销公债、劳军等工作结合起来。
    寒假的时间比暑假短得多，各地青年团应及早准备寒假里的工作，并取得当地人民政府教育机关、学校行政方面和教师们的指导与帮助，这是必要的。另一方面，也不要忘记，寒假的时间既然很短，就不要计划太多的工作，应该根据当地的情况和工作的需要，有重点地做。学习的课程，不要多，而要有中心。学习共同纲领，也要有重点，并且要联系实际。
