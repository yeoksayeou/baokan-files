    The Head of the Pseudo Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Who Fled to Hong Kong Arbitrarily Moved Savings
    The Person in Charge of Our General Post Office Issued a Warning
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 13th] The person in charge of the General Post Office of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of our Central People's Government stated: Recently, it has been reported that He Zongyan and others, the heads of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Kuomintang government who fled to Hong Kong, have arbitrarily used and distributed more than 20 million US dollars of foreign exchange entrusted to the bureau. Many employees of the Guangdong Savings and Remittance Bureau have gone to Hong Kong to share the profits. All the property of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, including all foreign exchange funds, is the property of the Chinese people. On January 9th, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued an order requiring the responsible persons and all employees of all political, diplomatic, financial, economic, cultural, educational, and overseas Chinese affairs agencies of the former Kuomintang central and local governments stationed in Hong Kong to "diligently remain at their posts, be responsible for protecting all assets and archives, and not allow reactionaries to steal, destroy, transfer, or conceal anything. The original employees can be employed according to their abilities; those who protect assets with merit will be rewarded; otherwise, they will be investigated." If the personnel of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau stationed in Hong Kong can do their best to preserve all the assets and archives of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, they will naturally be given appropriate rewards according to the central government's order; those who have made meritorious contributions in protection and are willing to continue serving can be employed according to their abilities. If He Zongyan and others dare to dispose of the foreign exchange or other funds of the Savings and Remittance Bureau without authorization, this bureau will definitely report to the State Council of the Central People's Government for strict investigation and handling according to law, and will never be lenient.
