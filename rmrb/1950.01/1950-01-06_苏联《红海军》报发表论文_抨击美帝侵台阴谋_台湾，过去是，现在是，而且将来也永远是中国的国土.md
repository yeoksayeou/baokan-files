Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 5th: TASS Moscow, January 4th: "Red Navy" published an article by Kudryavtsev, commenting on the U.S. expansionist group's attempt to seize Taiwan. Kudryavtsev wrote that U.S. imperialists have long supported the reactionary, traitorous Chiang Kai-shek regime, intending to establish their military-strategic bridgehead in China. The aid received by the Kuomintang has reached a staggering six billion U.S. dollars. It is very clear that the U.S. imperialists are unwilling to accept defeat in their China policy. Representatives of the American aggressors are frantically drafting plans and schemes to salvage their aggressive policies in this region of the world. One of these plans is to turn Taiwan into a supply base for aggression against democratic China and the rapidly growing national liberation movements in Southeast Asian countries. The author emphasizes that the effort to include Taiwan in the American territories is a necessary result of the policy of rapidly organizing an aggressive Pacific group. The U.S. imperialists are enticed by Taiwan's geographical location and its proximity to the U.S.-owned Philippine Islands. The current issue is to include Taiwan and its convenient and well-equipped seaports into the U.S. Pacific base system. The U.S. attempt to occupy Taiwan should be seen as part of the extensive military construction undertaken by the U.S. in the Philippines. The author emphasizes that this is why the efforts to occupy Taiwan and strengthen the Philippine Islands are two links in the chain of aggressive measures taken by the U.S. to establish a Pacific group. There are also other circumstances that make the warmongers particularly interested in Taiwan. Taiwan has abundant important mineral deposits such as oil, coal, copper, gold, silver, and sulfur. Kudryavtsev concludes by saying that Taiwan, in the past, is now, and will forever be Chinese territory. The New Year's message to the soldiers and people issued by the CCP Central Committee has made this clear.

    苏联《红海军》报发表论文
    抨击美帝侵台阴谋
    台湾，过去是，现在是，而且将来也永远是中国的国土
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：《红海军》发表库德里亚夫切夫的论文，评述美国扩张主义集团力图攫取台湾。库德里亚夫切夫写道，美帝国主义分子很久以来就支持反动的、卖国的蒋介石政权，意图在中国建立他们军事战略桥头堡。国民党所得的援助为数已达六十亿美元之巨。十分显明，对于他们的对华政策的失败，美帝国主义分子是不肯甘心的。美国侵略分子的代表们，正在狂热地草拟方案与计划，想挽救他们在世界这一区域的侵略政策。这些方案之一，便是把台湾变成侵略民主中国和民族解放运动迅速壮大中的东南亚各国的补给基地。作者强调说，把台湾包括进美国属地中的努力，乃是急促地组织侵略性太平洋集团的政策的必然结果。美帝国主义分子被台湾的地理位置和台湾邻近美国所有的菲律宾群岛的地位所引诱。现在的问题便在于，把台湾及其便利的设备良好的海港包括进美国太平洋基地体系中。美国占领台湾的企图，应该看作是美国在菲律宾的广泛军事建设的一部分。作者强调说，这便是为什么占领台湾和增强菲律宾群岛的努力是美国图谋建立太平洋集团的侵略措施的锁链上的两个环节。也还有其他的情况使战争贩子对台湾特别感兴趣。台湾有丰富的重要矿藏如石油、煤、铜、金、银和硫磺。库德里亚夫切夫在结语中说，但是台湾，过去是，现在是，而且将来也永远是中国的国土。中共中央新年告将士和人民书已表明了这一点。
