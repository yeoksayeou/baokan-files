Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 30th. The National Shop Employees' Union Work Conference, convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on the 12th of this month, concluded on the 19th. After eight days of reports and discussions, the conference produced a summary of the experience of shop employees' unions in signing collective contracts; and passed resolutions on several organizational matters of shop employees' unions and on the establishment of a preparatory committee for the China Shop Employees' Union Federation. These summaries and resolutions have been approved by the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions held on the 22nd of this month.

	Combining the signing of collective contracts with organizing unions by industry can rapidly organize shop employees.

According to the reports of representatives from shop employees' unions in sixteen cities including Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Kaifeng, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, and Jinan, the total number of shop employees organized in the above cities is 330,085, of which 250,000 out of 300,000 shop employees in Shanghai alone have joined the union. After being organized and after signing labor-capital collective contracts, shop employees in various regions generally demonstrate good labor discipline, work actively, and are truly able to correctly implement the principle of benefiting both labor and capital. There are many good examples of this in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Harbin, and other places. However, in the process of signing collective contracts, many places have also taken detours due to union cadres' over-involvement and failure to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of shop employees and guide them to solve problems themselves. Therefore, the signing of collective contracts in industries such as the photography industry in Shanghai and the Chinese medicine industry in Tianjin and Zhangjiakou has not achieved the expected results. The reports from representatives from various regions prove that combining the signing of collective contracts with organizing unions by industry can rapidly organize the millions of shop employees scattered across various regions and establish normal labor-capital relations.

Regarding the organizational issues of shop employees' unions, the conference stipulated that workers and staff in various commercial sectors, whether state-owned, publicly owned, privately owned, or jointly owned by public and private entities, as well as workers and staff in factories and workshops attached to various commercial sectors, should be organized into unified shop employees' unions in their respective industries. The organizational system of shop employees' unions is as follows: at the national level, the National Committee of the China Shop Employees' Union Federation; in major administrative areas, regional shop employees' union federations; in provinces, provincial shop employees' union federations; in cities, municipal shop employees' union federations; and in counties or towns, county or town shop employees' unions. Under the shop employees' union federations are shop employees' unions, branches, sub-branches, and member groups in various industries. Under the county shop employees' unions are branches in various industries and market towns; industries with very few members may not establish branches.

	The conference decided to convene the First National Shop Employees' Union Congress in June of this year.

In order to unify leadership and actively promote the organization and education of shop employees nationwide, the conference decided to establish a preparatory committee for the China Shop Employees' Union Federation, electing Chang Jinglin, Zhang Chunjiu, and twenty-one others as preparatory committee members; and decided to convene the First National Shop Employees' Union Congress in June 1950 to formally establish the China Shop Employees' Union Federation. Before the establishment of this congress, the preparatory committee for the China Shop Employees' Union Federation will be the unified leading body of shop employees' unions nationwide.

During the National Shop Employees' Union Work Conference, Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, provided detailed answers to the questions raised by representatives from various regions regarding the current commercial situation and its prospects, the tasks of shop employees' unions, the signing of collective contracts, and the organization of shop employees' unions. At the conclusion of the conference, Liu Shaoqi, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, also delivered a report on the work of shop employees' unions. These answers and reports provided the representatives with a clear understanding of the commercial policies of the People's Government, the mass line for organizing unions, and the importance of shop employees' unions in restoring and developing production, prospering the economy, and implementing the commercial and labor policies of the People's Government. At the same time, they also gained a full understanding of the steps and methods for organizing shop employees scattered across various industries and sectors throughout the country, which will enable future organizational work to avoid detours or take fewer detours.

    全国店员工会工作会议闭幕
    总结签订集体合同经验
    全国店员工会联合会筹委会成立
    【新华社北京三十日电】中华全国总工会于本月十二日召开的全国店员工会工作会议，已于十九日闭幕。会议经过八天的报告、讨论，作出了关于店员工会签订集体合同经验的总结；并通过了关于店员工会几个组织问题的决议和关于成立中国店员工会联合会筹备委员会的决议。这些总结和决议已经本月二十二日举行的中华全国总工会常务委员会扩大会议的批准。
            结合订立集体合同按行业组织工会可以迅速地组织店员
    根据出席会议的上海、南京、武汉、北京、天津、沈阳、大连、哈尔滨、太原、张家口、唐山、开封、洛阳、郑州、西安、济南等十六个城市店员工会代表的报告，上述各个城市已组织起来的店员共有三十三万零八十五人，其中上海一地三十万店员中，已有二十五万人加入工会。各地店员经过组织起来，以及订立劳资集体合同之后，一般都表现劳动纪律好，工作积极，真正能够正确地执行劳资两利的方针。这在上海、北京、天津、哈尔滨等地，都有许多良好的例子。但是，在订立集体合同时，也有不少地方由于工会工作干部的包办代替，没有充分发动店员的积极性，引导他们自己来解决问题，走了不少弯路。因此，如上海照像业和天津、张家口国药等业的订立集体合同，就没有收到预期的效果。从各地代表的报告中证明：结合订立集体合同，按行业组织工会，是可以迅速地把分散在各地的数百万店员组织起来，并建立起正常的劳资关系的。
    关于店员工会的组织问题，会议规定：不论国营、公营、私营和公私合营的各种商业部门的工人、职员，以及各商业部门所附设的工厂、作坊中的工人和职员，都应该组织在各该行业统一的店员工会之中。店员工会的组织系统，在全国，为中国店员工会联合会全国委员会。在各大行政区，为地区店员工会联合会。在省，为省店员工会联合会。在市，为市店员工会联合会。在县或镇，为县或镇店员工会。在店员工会联合会之下，为各行业的店员工会、分会、支会和会员小组。在县店员工会之下，为各行业和集镇的分会，会员小组人数很少的行业，可不成立分会。
            会议决定今年六月召开第一届全国店员工会代表大会
    为了统一领导和积极推进全国店员的组织、教育工作，会议决定成立中国店员工会联合会筹备委员会，由会议选举常景林、张春久等二十三人为筹备委员；并决定于一九五○年六月召开第一届全国店员工会代表大会，正式成立中国店员工会联合会。在这个会未成立之前，中国店员工会联合会筹备委员会即为全国店员工会的统一领导机关。
    在全国店员工会工作会议进行期间，中华全国总工会副主席李立三，曾经在会上详细解答了各地代表所提出的关于目前商业情况及其前途、店员工会的任务、订立集体合同以及店员工会组织等问题。在会议结束时，中华全国总工会名誉主席刘少奇也在会上作了关于店员工会工作问题的报告。这些问题的解答和报告，使出席会议的代表们对于人民政府的商业政策、组织工会的群众路线问题，以及店员工会对于恢复和发展生产、繁荣经济、实现人民政府商业政策和劳动政策的重要性，都有了明确的认识。同时，对于如何把全国各地分散在各行、各业中的店员组织起来的步骤和方法，也有了充分的认识，这使今后的组织工作可以少走或不走弯路。
