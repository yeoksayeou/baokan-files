    Implementing Chairman Mao's Instructions
    North China Military Region Troops Actively Prepare for Production
    Have Begun Reclaiming Land, Accumulating Large Amounts of Manure, and Raising Agricultural Implements and Seeds, etc.
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to implement Chairman Mao's instruction on troops participating in production and construction in 1950, the troops of the North China Military Region have begun production preparation work one after another. Because most of the commanders and fighters of the troops were born of working people and have a lot of experience in production, everyone is full of confidence in carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions. Guo Xianggen, a veteran of an engineering battalion of a certain army, said: "In 1944, we solved the problem of several months of food while fighting and producing. Now we are even more confident in a peaceful environment." Zhao Youliang, of the logistics department of an artillery regiment of a certain army group, said: "I was born a farmer, and I am no stranger to farming. I have to make a contribution!" Now the troops are actively carrying out preparation work. Some units have flattened the fortifications and trenches left by the enemy and plan to cultivate the land in the spring. Some units are actively collecting fertilizer. A certain army has launched a heat wave of accumulating fertilizer to lay the foundation for this year's agricultural production. The Ninth Company of a certain regiment of the army collectively used after-school activity time to pick up manure, accumulating more than 5,000 kilograms in two weeks. The First Company of the Army Direct Engineering Battalion specifically studied the issue of accumulating fertilizer at the branch. Under the guarantee of the branch and the leadership of the administration, more than 50,000 kilograms of fertilizer have now been accumulated, completing 73 percent of the fertilizer accumulation task. The Second Company of a certain artillery battalion of a certain division, the branch called on everyone to accumulate 50 baskets of fertilizer before the end of the old lunar year. Now the whole company has accumulated 1,030 baskets and six large carts, and 87 baskets of manure have been picked up in ten days. A certain army group stationed in Tianjin has determined the specific tasks of production and construction in 1950. This task is mainly large-scale agricultural production; at the same time, develop some light industry and sideline occupations. Each person is required to reclaim more than one and a half to three acres of wasteland this year.
            In sideline production, prepare to operate fishing ponds, reed ponds, raise ducks, open pastures, and gradually establish iron factories, rice mills, etc.
    In sideline production, it is planned to operate fishing ponds, reed ponds, raise ducks, open pastures, and gradually establish iron factories, paper mills, rice mills, brick kilns, lime kilns, etc. In addition, it is also planned to build barracks, classrooms, playgrounds, highways, etc. near the farms, to completely combine national defense, production, and military training. The army group has now hired several agricultural and water conservancy experts, and has begun to survey land, test water volume, calculate labor force, prepare agricultural implements, seeds, fertilizers, and prepare to establish a profit-sharing incentive system. Since October 3 of last year, the army group spent 59 days working on its own to build a great and spectacular new-style barracks on a ruin that had been frantically destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits, saving the state more than 400 million yuan.

    执行毛泽东主席指示
    华北军区各部队积极准备生产
    已开始垦辟耕地、大量积肥，并筹集农具种籽等。
    【本报讯】华北军区各部队为执行毛主席关于一九五○年部队参加生产建设的指示，纷纷着手进行生产准备工作。由于各部队指战员大多数是劳动人民出身，对生产具有不少经验，所以大家对于执行毛主席指示充满百倍信心。某军工兵营老战士郭香根说：“一九四四年我们一面战斗一面生产，还解决了几个月的粮食问题。现在和平环境下更有把握了”。某兵团炮兵团后勤处赵有良说：“咱是农民出身，种地可不外行，非立一功不可”。现在各部队正在积极进行准备工作。有的单位把敌人遗留下来的工事壕沟平毁了，计划开春种地。有的单位则在积极集肥。某军为给今年农业生产打下基础，已掀起了积肥热潮。该军某团九连集体利用课外活动时间拾粪，两周内积了五千多斤。军直工兵营一连到支部专门研究了积肥问题。在支部保证和行政领导下，现在已积肥五万余斤，完成积肥任务百分之七十三。某师炮某营二连，支部号召每人到旧历年底，积肥五十筐。现全连十天已积肥一千零三十筐又六大车，拾粪八十七筐。驻津某兵团已确定一九五○年生产建设的具体任务。该项任务以大规模的农业生产为主；同时发展某些轻工业及副业。要求每人在今年开荒一亩半至三亩以上。
            副业生产，准备经营渔塘牧场开设铁工厂碾米厂等。
    在副业生产上，准备经营渔塘、苇塘、养鸭、开设牧场，并逐渐设立铁工厂、造纸厂、碾米厂、砖窑、石灰窑等。此外，在农场附近并计划修建营房、课堂、操场、公路等，把国防、生产、练兵完全结合起来。该兵团现已聘妥若干农业、水利专家，并已开始勘察土地，测验水量，计算劳动力，筹备农具、种籽、肥料，并准备订立分红奖励制度。该兵团曾自去年十月三日开始，经过五十九天的时间，自己动手将驻地曾被国民党匪军疯狂破坏的一片废墟，修建为一种伟大而壮观的新式兵营，给国家节省开支达四亿余元。
