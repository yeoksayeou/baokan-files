    [Northeast News] The Dagong Mining area of Xi'an Coal Mine in Northeast China adopted the method of "pithead schools" in organizing workers' spare-time learning, holding classes near the work sites, and scheduling teaching time according to work hours, overcoming the difficulties in learning caused by workers being scattered and having inconsistent work hours. The No. 2 and No. 3 pits of the mine have more than 900 workers. Before the establishment of "pithead schools," only 90 people participated in learning, and sometimes they were not all present. The reason was that the centralized learning location was too far from the dormitory and work site, making it inconvenient for workers to attend classes; workers worked in three shifts, while the learning time was from 6 pm to 8 pm, making it impossible for many workers to participate in learning. In response to the above reasons, after research by the trade union, the past fixed-time learning was changed to "pithead schools," using idle houses at the pithead for classes; learning time was scheduled according to work hours, with one hour of learning before each shift; each shift had three teachers for politics, culture, and technology, who were cadres, staff, or workers with higher cultural or technical levels from the same shift. In addition to textbooks, the teaching materials also explained some production problems and experiences. In order to unify the learning leadership of the three shifts, a pithead school committee was established, overcoming the past phenomenon of disorganization and lack of planning. After this, the number of workers participating in learning suddenly increased from 10% of the total number to 90%, and the combination of education and production was close, which greatly promoted production. For example, Yue Decai from the No. 2 pit created a new record for track laying. The "pithead school" immediately introduced his experience to all workers, so that the efficiency of each shift in the entire pit increased from one meter to more than three meters. The daily output of the No. 3 pit also increased from 247 tons to 400 tons.

    东北西安煤矿大成矿建立坑口学校
    组织矿工业余学习推动生产
    【东北讯】西安煤矿大成矿在组织工人业余学习中，采用了“坑口学校”办法，就工作地点附近上课，教学时间随工作时间排定，克服了工人分散、工作时间不一致影响学习的困难。该矿二、三坑有工人九百余名，未成立“坑口学校”之前，仅有九十人参加学习，有时还到不齐。其原因由于集中学习地点离宿舍及工作地太远，工人上课不方便；工人作业是三班轮流，而学习时间是晚上六时至八时，许多工人无法参加学习。针对上述原因，经工会研究，将过去定时学习改成“坑口学校”，利用坑口的闲房子上课；学习时间随工作时间排定，每班上班前学习一小时；每班有政治、文化、技术三位教员，由本班内干部、职员或文化、技术较高的工人担任。教材除课本外，并讲解一些生产中的问题和经验。为统一三个班的学习领导，成立了坑口学委会，克服过去无组织无计划现象。此后，参加学习的工人由全体人数的百分之十突增至百分之九十，而且教育和生产配合密切，对生产推动作用很大。如二坑岳得才创造了送道新纪录，“坑口学校”即将其经验介绍给全体工人，使全坑各班效率，都由一米提高到三米多。三坑的日产量也由二百四十七吨增至四百吨。
