    【Our Newspaper Dispatches】A widespread production and disaster relief movement is unfolding in various parts of East China. After conducting in-depth investigations of the disaster situation and understanding the specific local conditions, governments at all levels are separately organizing disaster victims to engage in production for self-relief, conserve resources for famine preparedness, and launch social mutual assistance in a planned manner. They are paying particular attention to water conservancy projects, using work-for-food programs, and emphasizing overcoming the disaster through the restoration of production. Millions of disaster victims have participated in the movement of repairing dikes, harnessing rivers, and using production for self-relief to overcome the famine.

    Along the Yangtze River and Huai River in areas such as Northern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, and Southern Anhui, the dikes had been in disrepair for many years under Kuomintang rule. In addition, the Kuomintang bandit troops built fortifications along the banks of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers before liberation, resulting in numerous breaches in the dikes. After the liberation of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, the people's governments mobilized the masses to vigorously repair them, but because the dikes were too severely damaged, continuous rain since the beginning of summer, coupled with the surge of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers and typhoon attacks causing seawater backflow, resulted in a major disaster in Northern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, and Southern Anhui, causing significant losses to the people. In total, 52 million mu of land were flooded in the entire East China region, affecting 16 million people. According to engineering survey and estimation reports, repairing the above projects requires approximately 189,467,000 cubic meters of earthwork, requiring 190 million man-days of labor (calculated based on each person doing at least 1 cubic meter of earthwork per day).

    Repairing the dikes along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers in Northern Anhui, guiding the Yi River in Northern Jiangsu, and guiding the Shu and rectifying the Yi River in Shandong, once all the projects are completed, can ensure a bumper harvest for 40 million mu of farmland.

    In order to completely eliminate water disasters and ensure and develop agricultural production in the East China region, the Central People's Government has planned to allocate 231.194 million catties of grain (including the 100 million catties of grain already allocated to East China) to subsidize water conservancy projects in East China. Provinces and regions have also allocated huge amounts of grain from local public grain reserves, adopting the "work-for-food" method to lead the masses in disaster-stricken areas to save themselves and overcome the famine. The Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office has allocated 113.8 million catties of grain, the Northern Anhui Administrative Office has allocated 80 million catties of grain, the Southern Anhui Administrative Office has allocated 24 million catties of grain, and Southern Jiangsu has allocated more than 30 million catties of grain, planning to organize disaster victims to complete the repair of the Yangtze and Huai River dikes this winter and spring, and to also repair the Yi River.

    In order to ensure the successful completion of this year's disaster relief and dike repair work, party and government leading organs at all levels in Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, and other regions have issued instructions, calling for the organization of all forces to invest in the water management movement. The Yi River diversion project in Northern Jiangsu began full-scale construction in late November last year. Upon completion of this project, not only will 8.2 million mu of farmland be spared from flooding, but also 500 million catties of grain can be increased annually. The Northern Anhui region mobilized more than 200,000 people to repair the Yangtze River, Huai River dikes and inner river tributary dikes, and partially started construction on December 8th last year. The repair project in Southern Anhui began on November 10th last year, and 700,000 mu of farmland had already been protected during the flood fighting. The Shu and Yi River rectification project in Shandong began construction as early as the spring of last year, and the entire project is expected to be completed and put into operation in the summer of 1952. If the above projects can be fully completed, 40 million mu of farmland in the East China region can be ensured of a bumper harvest.

    In Anhui, Jiangsu, and other places, while carrying out work-for-food projects such as repairing the Jianghuai dikes, diverting the Yi and governing the Shu, and reclaiming land along the coast, disaster victims are also being universally mobilized to engage in production for self-relief. For example, under the slogan of "Production for self-relief, stay put," disaster victims in Suqian have widely planted more than 500,000 mu of green vegetables in front of and behind their houses. Coastal lake areas are netting fish. In Taibei County, Northern Jiangsu, disaster victims in seven districts earned more than 300 dan of grain in half a month, and can also take care of households in difficulty besides their own consumption. The Huaiyin Trading Company allocated 600,000 catties of grain to organize disaster victims to engage in sideline production such as starch making, oil pressing, and mat weaving, and helped solve the sales of finished products. Starch making alone can solve the lives of 400,000 disaster victims for a month. Anqing Special Zone organized fishing, solving the livelihoods of 500,000 people. Fuyang Special Zone organized 754 shoe-making groups, earning wage rice of more than 4.4 million catties. In addition, some places also have shortcomings in organizing sideline production, failing to comprehensively consider the issue, and the products cannot be sold, causing the masses to suffer losses. For example, the stone quarrying production in some mountainous areas of Shandong cannot be sold externally, which is of no benefit to disaster victims.

    After the autumn harvest in September last year, the Shandong Provincial People's Government immediately arranged disaster relief work based on the disaster situation. Disaster areas in various regions calculated the amount of grain shortage based on the amount of food harvested, formulated winter production plans, vigorously publicized production for self-relief, and called on people not to flee the famine and not to starve to death. First, they led disaster victims in various places to plant a season of vegetables after the autumn harvest. Lucentral South and Bohai regions have harvested a lot of cabbage and carrots. Women are also organized to collect wild vegetables and sweet potato leaves. Shan Nishan Special Zone alone has accumulated more than 14 million catties of vegetables. After the arrival of winter, various places also developed sideline production based on local advantageous conditions. The Bohai region has a lot of alkaline land, so disaster victims are organized to produce nitrate. Lucentral South transports and sells mountain fruits through cooperatives. Jiaodong women produce straw braid, hairnets, and lace, which are purchased by state-owned trade enterprises, and exchanged for grain in North China and Northeast China. At the same time, the government uses work-for-food programs to build water conservancy projects, such as the Lucentral South region mobilizing 100,000 disaster victims to repair the Shu River. The entire project needs 40 days to complete. It is estimated that each person can have 200 to 300 catties of food left over besides eating, which can solve the livelihood problems of hundreds of thousands of people.

    More than 10 million people have been affected by the disaster in East China, and disaster relief work is a serious task. Responsible cadres at all levels must conscientiously implement the directives of the Government Administration Council and pay close attention to and strengthen leadership in this work. They must often personally check various disaster relief tasks. In non-disaster areas and cities, the movement of saving resources for disaster relief should also be widely carried out, focusing on providing relief to the most severely affected areas and assisting disaster victims in production.

    华东灾区生产自救
    数百万灾民以工代赈治河修堤
    山东积极开展副业生产保证渡过春荒
    【本报讯】华东各地生产救灾运动普遍展开。各级人民政府于深入调查灾情了解当地具体条件后，分别有计划地组织灾民生产自救，节约备荒，发动社会互济；并特别注意兴修水利，以工代赈，强调从恢复生产中克服灾荒。数百万灾民参加了修堤治河、生产自救渡荒的运动。
    苏北、苏南、皖北、皖南等区沿长江淮河等处堤防，在国民党统治中长年失修，加上解放前国民党匪军沿长江、淮河堤岸构筑工事，以致江淮堤岸百孔千疮。苏皖两省解放后，人民政府虽动员群众大力抢修，但因堤岸受创过重，入夏以来霪雨连绵，长江、淮河水势猛涨，再加台风袭击，海水倒灌，以致苏北、苏南、皖北、皖南等地形成巨灾，人民遭受重大损失。总计华东全区被淹土地五千二百万亩，受灾群众达一千六百万。根据工程测量勘估报告，要修复以上工程，约需土方一八九、四六七、○○○公方，需人工一亿九千万个（按每人每天至少做一立方公尺土方计算）。
    皖北修整江淮堤圩，苏北导治沂河、山东导沭整沂，全部工程完成后，可使四千万亩良田确保丰收。
    为彻底消除水患，保证与发展华东区农业生产，中央人民政府已拟拨粮米两亿三千一百九十四万斤（内包括华东已拨粮食一亿斤在内），补助华东水利工程，各省区亦由地方公粮中拨出巨额粮食，采取“以工代赈”办法，领导灾区群众自救渡荒。计苏北行署已拨粮食一亿一千三百八十万斤，皖北行署拨粮八千万斤，皖南行署拨粮二千四百万斤，苏南拨粮三千余万斤，拟组织灾民于去冬今春完成修复长江、淮河圩堤，并修治沂河。
    为保证今年救灾修堤工作的胜利完成，苏北、皖北等区各级党政领导机关，曾分别发出指示，号召组织一切力量投入治水运动。苏北导沂工程已于去年十一月下旬全面动工，此工程完成后，不仅可使八百二十万亩良田免于水患，且每年可增产粮食五万万斤。皖北区兴修江、淮堤圩及内河支堤，动员民力达二十余万人，已于去年十二月八日部分开工。皖南区修复工程已于去年十一月十日开工，在抢险中即已保住良田七十万亩。山东的导沭整沂工程，早在去年春季即已开始动工，全部工程预计于一九五二年夏天完成放水任务。如以上工程能全部完成，华东区即有四千万亩良田可确保丰收。
    安徽、江苏等地，在以工代赈修整江淮圩堤、导沂治沭、沿海兴垦等工作进行中，同时普遍发动灾民生产自救。如宿迁灾民在“生产自救，就地坚持”的口号下，纷纷于家前屋后，广种青菜达五十余万亩。沿海湖地区则结网捕鱼。苏北区台北县七个区灾民半个月赚粮食三百多担，除自家食用外，还能照顾困难户。淮阴贸易公司拨粮六十万斤，组织灾民拐粉、榨油、织席等副业生产，并帮助解决成品的销路。其中仅拐粉一项，即可解决四十万灾民一个月的生活。安庆专区组织捕鱼，解决了五十万人生活。阜阳专区组织七百五十四个做鞋组，赚工资米四百四十多万斤食粮。另外，也有些地方组织副业生产时还有缺点，没有全面考虑问题，产品打不开销路而使群众反受到损失。如山东某些山区的采石生产，产品无法外销，对灾民毫无补益。
    山东去年九月秋收后，省人民政府即根据灾情布置救灾工作，各地灾区根据食粮收获量分别计算缺粮数额，订出冬季生产计划，大力宣传生产自救，号召不逃荒、不饿死人。首先，领导各地灾民秋收后种菜一季。鲁中南、渤海区均收获不少白菜、胡萝卜。更组织妇女采集野菜、甘薯叶。单尼山专区即积菜一千四百余万斤。冬季来临后，各地又根据本地有利条件，开展副业生产。渤海区多碱地，即组织灾民制硝。鲁中南则通过合作社运销山果。胶东妇女则生产草帽辫、发网、花边，由公营贸易企业收购，并以土布向华北东北换粮。同时政府又以工代赈，兴修水利，如鲁中南区发动十万灾民修治沭河，全部工程需四十日完工，估计每人除吃外，可剩余食粮二百斤至三百斤；总共可解决数十万人生活问题。
    华东受灾人民一千多万，救灾工作是个严重的任务，各级负责干部，要切实执行政务院指示，密切注意并加强领导这一工作。要经常亲自动手检查各项救灾工作。在非灾区及城市，也应广泛开展节约救灾运动，有重点地救济受灾最重的地区，援助灾民进行生产。
