Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd: The struggle of workers in Hong Kong's five major public utilities (tram, telephone, electric light, China Light and Power, and gas) and enterprises such as Taikoo Dockyard, Hong Kong Match Factory, and Dairy Farm for improved living standards is ongoing. These enterprises have made huge profits over the years, but workers are in dire straits because rising prices (some have risen several times) mean their income is insufficient to maintain a minimum standard of living. Therefore, in November and December of last year, workers separately put forward reasonable demands for wage increases, special cost-of-living allowances, year-end bonuses, and related worker benefits. The management rejected all of these demands except for agreeing to issue year-end bonuses, causing extreme indignation among all employees. After repeated unsuccessful negotiations, tram workers first implemented a slowdown on December 24th of last year, driving the trams as usual but not selling tickets. The employees publicly announced that this was to take care of the transportation needs of the citizens, while also hoping that the management would sincerely reopen negotiations. During the slowdown, tram workers automatically dispatched pickets to take care of passengers getting on and off, and order was well-maintained, winning widespread sympathy from the citizens. However, the management not only showed no sincerity in reopening negotiations, but also announced on the 28th that it would close the depot and dismiss all ticket sellers. Tram workers disregarded the management's threats and collectively swore to persist in the struggle until victory. This righteous action of the tram workers was supported by the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, which called on 100,000 workers to launch a "one person, one dollar" movement to support their brothers fighting for survival. Subsequently, the United Statement from the employees of the four major public utilities of telephone, electric light, China Light and Power, and gas declared their firm support to the end; China Airlines, the Hardware Workers' Union, Hong Kong Textile Mill workers, dockyard workers, and workers working in Hong Kong government and military agencies all went to express their sympathy and support. Representatives from other trade unions and social organizations also brought funds and gifts to express their condolences. All of this greatly encouraged the tram workers to persist in their struggle. Now, they gather at the union on time every day to listen to reports from union leaders and participate in various cultural and recreational activities. During this period, labor disputes at Telephone, Electric Light, Gas, Dairy Farm, and China Light and Power companies have also not been resolved because the management has adopted delaying tactics and shown no sincerity in negotiations regarding the workers' reasonable demands. Since the outbreak of this labor unrest, the Hong Kong British government has consistently sided with the management and adopted violent suppression measures, arresting worker representatives and union leaders. As early as November 22nd of last year, the Hong Kong Match Factory workers, who had already gone on strike, sent sixty-six representatives to the company's office on December 29th to demand the reopening of negotiations. Hong Kong police barbarously injured seven representatives and arrested all the representatives, unreasonably sentencing them to three months of hard labor and deporting them upon completion of their sentences. Such unreasonable measures by the Hong Kong British government to suppress workers are only making labor disputes more serious.

    电车工人怠工获广泛支援
    香港英政府无理压迫工人
    【新华社广州二十二日电】香港电车、电话、电灯、中华电力、煤气等五大公用事业及太古船坞、香港火柴厂、牛奶公司等企业的工人要求改善生活待遇的斗争正在持续进行中。这些企业年来均获巨利，但工人则因物价上涨（有的上涨数倍），收入不足以维持最低限度的生活，境况极为困难。故年前十一月及十二月间，工人们即曾分别提出增加工资、发给特别生活津贴和年底花红及有关工人福利等合理要求。资方对职工们的这些要求，除允发给年底花红外，其余一概拒绝，引起全体员工极度愤慨。电车工人于反复交涉无效后，首于去年十二月二十四日实行怠工，照常开车但不卖票。员工们公开宣布这是照顾市民交通的需要，同时希望资方诚意重开谈判。在怠工进行期间，电车工人自动派出纠察队，照顾乘客上下，秩序井然，获得市民的广泛同情。然资方不但毫无重开谈判诚意，反而于二十八日宣布封闭车房、开除全体售票员。电车工人不顾资方威胁，并集体宣誓坚持斗争，直到胜利。电车工人的这一正义行动，获得了香港工联会的支持，工联会并号召十万工人发动一人一元运动，支援为生存而斗争的弟兄。接着，电话、电灯、中华电力、煤气等四大公用事业职工联合声明坚决支援到底；中国航空公司、五金工会、香港纱厂工友、船坞工友及在香港政府、军部等机关作工的工友都先后前往慰劳。其他各工会及社团代表亦纷纷携带款项及礼物前往慰问。所有这些，大大鼓励了电车工人们坚持斗争。现在他们每天都按时齐集工会，听工会负责人的报告和进行各种文化娱乐活动。在此期间，电话、电灯、煤气、牛奶公司、中华电力公司的劳资纠纷，亦因资方对工人们的合理要求采取拖延办法、毫无谈判诚意，故迄未解决。此次工潮发生后，香港英政府一直站在资方一边，并采取暴力镇压手段，拘捕工人代表和工会领袖。早在去年十一月二十二日就已罢工的香港火柴厂工人，于十二月二十九日派了六十六个代表到公司办事处要求重开谈判时，香港警察即横蛮地打伤了七个代表，并将全体代表拘捕，无理宣判苦监三个月，期满驱逐出境。香港英政府这种无理压迫工人的措施，徒使劳资纠纷更形严重。
