    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 8th (via TASS): In 1950, the Soviet Union will undertake the construction of rural power stations on an even larger scale. The amount of electricity used in Soviet agriculture this year will reach 3 billion kilowatt-hours, and all state farms and machine and tractor stations will receive all the electricity they need this year.

    The large-scale electrification of Soviet agriculture is due to the implementation of the collective farm system. In 1929, when the construction of collective farms had just begun, there were only 700 small electrical facilities in the countryside, able to supply electricity to only a few hundred villages, and the electricity generated was mainly for personal use by the peasants. However, four years later, the number of collective farms receiving electricity had tripled, and electricity began to be used in cultivation. The rate of construction of rural power stations was particularly rapid in the years following the end of the war. In 1945, the number of collective farms enjoying electricity supply more than doubled compared to pre-war levels. Currently, more than 26,000 collective farms are widely using electricity in production and daily life.

    Electricity has been applied to all sectors of agriculture—collective farm repair shops, forges, mills, and livestock farms. The "Dukukinsky" collective farm in the Moscow region uses electric threshing machines, reducing labor by a quarter. There, electricity is used for selecting, cleaning, and drying grains, as well as grinding flour. Collective farm sawmills and machine repair shops also use electricity.

    The "Red Labor" collective farm in Udmurtia uses electricity for all kinds of work. The entire village enjoys the convenience of radio broadcasting, and the club has a sound film projector. Many collective farms use electricity for cultivation. Three machine and tractor stations already possess electric tractors.

    在生产和日常生活中广泛使用电力
    苏大力建设农村电力站
    今年农业使用电量将达卅亿千瓦时
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：一九五○年，苏联将更大规模地进行农村电力站的建设。苏联农业所使用的电量，今年将达三十亿千瓦时，全部的国营农场和机器与拖拉机站，今年将得到全部所需的电力。
    苏联农业之所以能够大规模地电气化，是由于实行了集体农场制度。在一九二九年，当集体农场的建设刚开始的时候，农村中仅有七百个小型电力设备，只能供电给几百个村庄，并且所发的电主要是供农民个人使用的。然而，在四年以后，得到电力供应的集体农场的数目已增加了三倍，并且开始在耕作上使用电力。农村电力站的建筑率，在战争结束的那几年特别迅速。一九四五年，享受电力供应的集体农场的数目，超过战前两倍半。现在，二万六千多个集体农场已于生产和日常生活中广泛使用电力。
    电力已被运用到农业的各个部门——集体农场的修理间、锻冶场、磨面场和牲畜饲养场。莫斯科州的“杜库金斯基”集体农场，使用电力打谷机而少费劳动四分之一。在那里，电力已用于选择、清洁和干燥谷物以及磨粉等工作。集体农场的锯木场和机器修理间也使用着电力。
    乌德慕尔特的“红色劳动”集体农场，在各种工作上均使用电力。全村享受着无线电广播的便利，俱乐部有有声电影机。许多集体农场利用电力耕作。三个机器和拖拉机站已拥有电动拖拉机。
