    Jinan's worker's spare-time schools have seen new developments. According to current statistics, there are currently thirty-three worker's spare-time schools in the city, with a total of 7,738 students, including 6,428 men and 1,310 women, and 159 teachers, including 12 full-time teachers. The rest are democratically elected or hired from among staff and workers. At present, most schools have initially embarked on a policy of focusing on cultural education, established necessary formal organizational leadership structures (such as cultural and educational committees, school committees, etc.) and systems (such as exams, roll call, schedules, leave applications, etc.). Elementary levels now have systematic cultural teaching materials and preliminary teaching plans. Class arrangements are more scientific (classes are divided according to actual cultural level through exams), and schools are initially moving towards regularization. However, some cadres, trade unions, and workers still lack sufficient understanding of the educational policy of focusing on cultural education and the importance of worker's spare-time schools. Some workers hold the idea that "I rely on technology for a living, and having technology can secure my job, so not having culture doesn't matter." At the same time, cadres running schools are not conducting extensive and in-depth publicity among the broad masses of workers, and leadership is not grasping tightly enough, and the difficulties and problems of the schools are not being resolved in a timely and appropriate manner, leaving the schools in an extremely unstable state. Therefore, nearly half of the factories have not yet opened worker's spare-time schools, and some of those that have opened still have deviations in grasping the direction of the school, with some factories simply conducting political education, or having too many courses, not adopting the principle of fewer but concentrated courses.

    Although classes are divided according to cultural level, there is a widespread phenomenon of chaos in class assignment. Some schools mix primary school level with junior high school level in the same class, and some do not consider their own strength and conditions, greedy for large numbers, and expand classes without limit (such as Chengtong dividing into fourteen classes), resulting in the dispersion of leadership strength, making it difficult to run even one class well.

    Some factories have an especially large number of meetings of all kinds, with some factories having meetings almost every day, which greatly affects the learning of students. Most meetings lack sufficient prior preparation and are not held in a planned, purposeful, and effective manner, resulting in lengthy meetings that fail to resolve or hardly resolve problems, objectively creating meetings for the sake of meetings.

    Some factories issue wages from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, or from 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM, which is precisely the workers' study time, and greatly affects learning.

    Teacher issues: Most teachers in spare-time schools are part-time, and due to their own busy and tiring work, they are unable to take care of it, making it difficult to run the schools well. Some teachers are also not dedicated and have low political quality. Hiring from outside the factory requires high salaries, and this problem must be resolved.

### 济南工人业余学校初步走上正规化

    济南工人业余学校初步走上正规化
    【本报讯】济南市目前工人业余学校，已有了新的发展。根据目前统计的材料，现有工人业余学校三十三处，共有学员七千七百三十八人，其中男六千四百二十八人，女一千三百十人，教员一百五十九人，其中专任教员十二名，其他全系从职员及工人群众中民主选举或聘请的。刻下一般学校，均已初步的走上了以文化教育为主的方针，建立了必要的正规的组织领导机构（如文教委员会、校委会等）和制度（如考试、点名、课程表、请假等），初级已有了系统的文化教材，有了初步的教学计划，编班已较科学（经考试按现有实际文化程度分别编班），初步的走上了正规化。但部分干部、工会和工人群众，对以文化教育为主的教育方针及工人业余学校的重要性，还认识不足。部分工人存在着“我凭技术吃饭，有了技术便能保住饭碗，没有文化倒不要紧的”的思想。同时办学校的干部对广大工人群众进行广泛而深入的宣传也不够，领导上抓的不紧，学校的困难与问题得不到及时的适当的解决，使学校处在极不巩固的状态。因此，目前将近半数工厂中还没有开办工人业余学校，已开办的还有个别在学校方针的掌握上有偏向，有的工厂单纯进行政治教育，或课程太多，不是采取少而集中的原则。
    编班虽是按文化程度，但在分班上却普遍的存在着紊乱现象，有个别学校将高小程度与初中程度混合编班，有的不根据自己的力量与条件，贪图人数多，无限制的扩大班级（如成通分十四班）以致分散了领导力量，一个班级也难办好。
    有的工厂各种会议特别多，有的工厂几乎每天都要开会，大大影响了学员的学习。会议又大都是缺乏事先充分的准备，不是有计划的、有目的的，有效果的开，致使会议拖拉，不能解决或不大解决问题，客观形成为开会而开会。
    有的工厂发工资的时间是在下午五点至八点，上午六点至十点，正是工人的学习时间，也很影响学习。
    教员问题：业余学校的教员大都是兼职，由于他们本身工作的繁忙与劳累，无力兼管，致使学校难以办好，有的教员也不尽职，政治质量低。从厂外聘请的要领高薪，这问题必须解决。
