Suggestions on Urban Agency Health Work
    Li Zhisui
    Our agency clinic was officially established in May 1949. It has 41 medical staff and provides medical services to approximately 2,000 people. From May to the end of November, over seven months, the clinic had a total of 9,407 visits (including initial and follow-up visits, excluding house calls). Among them, internal medicine and surgical cases totaled 5,764 visits, accounting for approximately 62% of all visits.

            I. Analysis of Major Cases Seen in Internal Medicine and Surgery:

    A. Internal Medicine:
    (1) Statistics show that there were 1,412 major internal medicine cases, accounting for 73.3% of the total initial visits. Excluding undiagnosed cases, there were a total of five types, with colds being the most common, accounting for 26.8% of all initial internal medicine cases. Looking at each month individually, the incidence rate was highest in spring, autumn, and winter (reaching 35.6% in November).

    (2) Next were dysentery and gastroenteritis, accounting for 13.5% of all initial internal medicine cases. The rate was higher in May because the clinic was newly established, and many chronic patients came for treatment. The rate was also higher in November because newly transferred staff members included chronic patients. Excluding May and November, the incidence rate was highest in August (19.9%) during the five months of June, July, August, September, and October, i.e., during hot weather.

    (3) Undiagnosed cases also accounted for a relatively high proportion of all initial internal medicine cases, at 13.2%. This is because the clinic's work focus is on outpatient services, making it impossible to conduct thorough examinations and continuous observation of patients. At the same time, due to limited conditions, diagnosis mainly relies on medical history and physical diagnostic methods. Although the laboratory has a microscope, it only has ordinary reagents and can only complete general routine tests.

    (4) Indigestion, including peptic ulcer cases, accounted for 12.1% of the total number of initial internal medicine visits.

    (5) Malaria accounted for 7.4% of the total number of initial internal medicine visits. It was most frequent in August, at 11.2%. There were no cases in May, and it decreased to 6.1% in November.

    (6) Among intestinal parasite cases, ascariasis was the main case, accounting for 5.4% of all initial internal medicine cases.

    (7) House calls also accounted for a large proportion of the clinic's work. However, the diagnosis of house call cases was based entirely on medical history and physical diagnostic methods, making it even more unclear.

    (8) Serious cases and emergencies were rare. In seven months, there were only two cases of typhoid fever, one case of lobar pneumonia, and one case of hemoptysis due to pulmonary tuberculosis, for a total of four cases. These only accounted for 0.25% of all initial internal medicine cases.

    B. Surgery:

    (1) Superficial skin and subcutaneous infections and skin trauma accounted for 71.8% of the 612 initial surgical cases.

    (2) Superficial skin and subcutaneous infections, including furuncles, scabies, and fungal infections of the feet, accounted for 49% of the total initial surgical cases.

    (3) Skin trauma, including abrasions, contusions, and lacerations, accounted for 22.8% of the total initial surgical cases.

    (4) Serious cases and emergencies were rare. In seven months, there were two cases of acute appendicitis and three cases of simple limb fractures, for a total of five cases. These accounted for 0.81% of the total initial surgical cases.

    C. Discussion:

    (1) Regarding medical efficacy: Under the current economic conditions, agency clinics and medical stations find it difficult to conduct complete examinations before diagnosis to confirm the diagnosis. After diagnosis, it is also impossible to carry out systematic treatment and observation. Diagnosis is sometimes uncertain, and in order to alleviate patient suffering or demands, medication is often overused, resulting in waste. Looking at the May pharmacy statistics, 5.63 grams of codeine phosphate were used in 25 days, while the supply standard was only 2.5 grams. 141 sulfadiazine tablets were used, while the supply standard was 300 tablets. The effect of this kind of medication is naturally not very good.

    (2) Prevention of major diseases seen: Statistics show that in internal medicine, apart from undiagnosed cases, five diseases (malaria, colds, gastroenteritis, dysentery, intestinal parasitic diseases) and two major surgical diseases (skin infectious diseases and skin trauma) can all be reduced through preventive methods, including personal hygiene, health education, environmental hygiene, and food hygiene. However, the current focus of agency clinics and medical stations is mainly on medical treatment. Not enough attention is paid to public health, which should be thoroughly corrected.

    (3) Technical issues of clinic staff: Medical work in clinical practice mainly involves diagnosis and treatment. Throughout this process, close cooperation between patients and medical staff, appropriate coordination among medical staff, meticulous and comprehensive examination, and systematic treatment, coupled with realistic observation and research, are required to enable each medical staff member to exert their working ability and achieve the greatest medical effect, and to improve their professional competence. Individual experiences without observation and research have shortcomings, and the technical improvement of clinic staff is limited, which in turn affects the improvement of treatment effectiveness.

    (4) Serious cases and emergencies account for a very small proportion. Under the existing conditions of the clinic, they cannot be handled and are all sent to hospitals. The clinic only serves as a bridge.

    (5) Due to the limitations of the clinic's equipment and the staff's lack of proficiency in mastering their skills, individual patients lack confidence in the clinic. This has led some patients to come to the clinic just to get a doctor's referral letter for hospital examination and treatment. Therefore, the relationship between patients and doctors is not very harmonious.

            II. Suggestions on Urban Agency Health Work:

    From the perspective of the entire people's health cause, the National Health Administration Conference has given a clear instruction: "Prevention is the main focus, treatment is supplementary, and the relationship between the two should be established." Under the current national economic conditions, coupled with the shortage of people's health workers, the promotion of national disease prevention work will require a considerable amount of time to achieve success. In the past, we have not accumulated much experience in disease prevention work, and the implementation of various details and specific measures in prevention work still requires us to seek experience in practical work and develop and create new methods. In an agency, personnel are concentrated, and living habits and conditions are similar. From the major diseases occurring in our agency clinic, we can see that they are relatively simple, and the incidence rate can be reduced through preventive methods. Administratively, sufficient assistance can also be obtained. These points objectively create conditions for us to implement, manage, and inspect public health work in agencies more easily, and it is naturally easier to achieve the expected results. The current prevention work is a key focus, and urban agencies can also be one of the key areas. The specific methods in the organization have been proposed by Comrade Huang Shuze (see his article "Organizational Issues of Urban Agency Health Work" in the 16th issue of this journal). I suggest that this kind of joint clinic can be attached to large hospitals. Each major hospital can be assigned one or two joint clinics, depending on the region and the size of the joint clinic organization. The clinic should have three departments: internal medicine, surgery, and health care. The medical staff in internal medicine and surgery are entirely composed of several internal medicine and surgery doctors and nurses from the hospital to which it is attached, who rotate monthly or bimonthly. (Currently, interns in major hospitals are assigned to various departments for cyclical rotation. When the hospital allocates work, the joint clinic can also be regarded as one of the departments of the hospital, and internal medicine and surgery residents and interns can be sent to work in the joint clinic in order.) Conduct centralized medical work, directly contact the relevant hospitals, and receive clinical guidance. The responsible cadres and health care staff of the joint clinic are appointed by the higher health authorities, responsible for medical and general administration, and the promotion of public health among the masses in the agencies under their jurisdiction, receiving instructions from the higher health authorities. And maintain contact with the health care department in the hospital to exchange experience. In this way, the principle of "prevention is the main focus, treatment is supplementary, and the relationship between the two should be established" in agency health work can be achieved. The advantages are as follows:

    (1) In terms of public health, formulate plans and work priorities according to the specific situation of each agency, including periodic physical examinations for cadres, vaccinations, improvement of environmental sanitation, improvement of diet and nutrition, etc., and provide systematic health education to colleagues with low education levels and poor reading abilities through cultural classes. Higher health authorities can compile popular health publications and reading materials to conduct systematic health education for colleagues with reading abilities. Furthermore, improve personal hygiene and eliminate harmful living habits.

    (2) In terms of medical treatment, because the medical work of the clinic is directly linked to the hospital, the effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment, the professional competence of medical staff, and work efficiency can be significantly improved. The consumption of drugs can be reduced, and a large number of staff can be saved. (According to our agency clinic, there are 41 staff members, with one medical staff member for every 50 people. Secondly, in the past seven months, there were a total of 9,407 initial and follow-up visits, with five doctors, averaging 268.4 visits per doctor per month, totaling less than 10 visits per person per day.)

    (3) Among the total of 9,407 initial and follow-up visits in seven months, obstetrics and gynecology examinations accounted for 34 visits, accounting for 0.3%, a very small proportion. There were more visits to the ENT department, but most of them were for trachoma and the diseases caused by trachoma. Therefore, this can be easily solved by having doctors from the corresponding departments of the hospital to which the clinic is attached rotate for outpatient services twice or three times a week.

    对城市机关卫生工作的建议
    李志绥
    我们机关门诊部在一九四九年五月正式成立，医务工作人员四十一人，医疗对象约为二千人左右，自五月至十一月底七个月中，门诊诊病次数共九四○七次（初复诊在内，出诊不计），其中内科及外科病例共有五七六四次，约占全体病例次数百分之六二。
            一、内外科所见主要病例的分析：
    甲、内科方面：
    （１）由统计可见内科主要病例为一四一二例，占初诊总数百分之七三·三，除诊断不明外共计五种，中以感冒为最多，占全体内科初诊病例中百分之二六·八。以每个月份单独看来，春、秋、冬发病率最高。（十一月份达百分之三五·六）
    （２）其次则为痢疾及肠胃炎，占全体内科初诊病例中百分之一三·五。在五月份因门诊部初成立，许多慢性患者来治，故比率较高。十一月份因有新调来工作人员中有慢性患者，故比率亦较高。除五月及十一月外，六、七、八、九、十，五个月中，可看出发病率最高在八月（百分之一九·九）亦即气候炎热时。
    （３）诊断不明在全体内科初诊病例中，所占比例数亦相当高，为百分之一三·二。此点由于门诊部工作中心在门诊，对患者无法进行周详的检查及继续观察，同时受条件限制，诊断主要依靠病历及物理诊断方法。化验室方面虽有显微镜一具，但只有普通试药，只能完成一般常规检验。
    （４）消化不良包括消化性溃疡病案，占全体内科初诊人数中百分之一二·一。
    （５）疟疾占全体内科初诊人数中百分之七·四。以八月份最多，为百分之一一·二。五月份无，十一月份降低到百分之六·一。
    （６）肠寄生虫病例中以蛔虫为主要病例，共占全体内科初诊病例中百分之五·四。
    （７）出诊在门诊部工作中亦占很大比重，但是出诊诊断方面，完全出之于病历及物理诊断方法，因此更不明确。
    （８）严重病例及急症很少，七个月中只有肠伤寒二，大叶性肺炎一，肺结核吐血一，共四例。在全体内科初诊病例中，只占百分之○·二五。
    乙、外科方面：
    （１）表皮及皮下浅部传染及表皮创伤，在外科初诊病例六一二中，共占百分之七一·八。
    （２）表皮及皮下浅部传染包括疖疮、疥、足部霉菌传染等，在外科初诊总病例中，占百分之四九。
    （３）表皮创伤包括擦伤、撞伤、撕裂伤，在外科初诊总病例中，占百分之二二·八。
    （４）严重病例及急症很少，七个月中有急性阑尾炎二例，简单肢骨骨折三例，共五例。在外科初诊总病例中，占百分之○·八一。
    丙、讨论：
    （１）医疗效果方面：在目前的经济条件下，机关门诊部及医务所，在诊断前难做到完全的检查工作，以确定诊断。诊断后亦不能做到系统的治疗及观察，诊断有时无法确定，而为了安慰病人痛苦或要求，于是常多用药，有浪费现象。以五月份药房统计来看，在二十五天内，磷酸可待因共用五·六三克，按供给标准，只有二·五克。磺胺嘧啶用一四一一片，按供给标准为三○○片。此种用药的效果，自然不会很好。
    （２）所见主要疾病的预防问题：由统计上可以看到，内科中除诊断不明以外，其中五种疾病（疟疾、感冒、肠胃炎、痢疾、肠寄生虫病）及外科主要二种疾病（皮肤传染病及皮肤创伤），都是可以以预防的方法，通过个人卫生，卫生教育，环境卫生，饮食卫生来减低的。而目前的机关门诊部及医务所工作主要重点，则放在医疗上。公共卫生方面重视不够，是应该彻底改正的。
    （３）门诊部工作人员的技术问题：医疗工作在临床上，主要在诊断及治疗。在这全部过程中，需要病人与医务人员密切合作，医务人员彼此之间适当的配合，经过精细的全面检查及系统治疗，再加上实事求是的观察与研究，才能使每个医务人员发挥出他的工作能力，得到最大的医疗效果，并可在掌握业务的能力上，提高一步。没有经过观察与研究的个别经验，是有缺点的，而且使门诊工作人员的技术提高上受到限制，反过来影响到治疗效果的改进。
    （４）严重病例及急症占比重很小，在门诊部现有条件下，无法处理，均送去医院。门诊部只起了桥梁作用。
    （５）因门诊部设备上的限制，及工作人员掌握业务不够熟练，个别病人对门诊部缺乏信心。造成了有些病人，到门诊部看病，只不过是为了要一张医生介绍入医院检查治疗的介绍信，因此病人与医生间的关系，是不很协调的。
            二、对城市机关卫生工作的建议：
    以整个人民保健事业来看，在全国卫生行政会议上，又有明确的指示：“预防为主，治疗为辅，并建立两者间依存与联系的关系”。在目前的国家经济条件下，再加上人民保健工作人员的缺少，全国的预防疾病工作的推行，还需要经过一个相当的时间才能有所成就。以往我们在预防疾病工作上的经验，累积不多，预防工作中各项细节及具体办法的推行，仍需要我们在实际工作中寻求经验，并发展与创造。在一个机关中，人员集中，生活习惯及生活条件互相近似。从我们机关门诊部门诊所发生的主要疾病来看，比较简单，而且都能以预防方法来减低发病率。在行政上也可以得到足够的协助。由这几点在客观上给我们创造了条件，使我们在机关中公共卫生工作的实施、管理、及检查都比较容易进行，也自然易于得到预期的效果。目前的预防工作，既是重点推行，城市机关，也可做重点之一。在机构上的具体办法，已由黄树则同志提出（见本刊第十六期《城市机关卫生工作的机构问题》一文），我建议这种联合门诊部，可以配属在大的医院之下。各大医院，按地区及按联合门诊部组织的大小，可分别配属一个或两个联合门诊部。门诊部内设内科、外科及保健科三科。内科及外科的医疗工作人员，完全由它被配属的医院中的内外科医生、护士数人，每月或每两个月轮流充任。（以目前各大医院的实习医生来说，是周期轮流分配到各科实习。在医院分配工作时，联合门诊部亦可视为医院的各科中的一个，内外科的住院医生及实习医生，可按秩序轮流派到联合门诊部工作。）进行集中的医疗工作，直接与各该医院联系，并接受临床上的指导。联合门诊部的负责干部及保健科工作人员，则由上级卫生机关委派，负责医务及一般行政，及所辖机关群众的公共卫生推行工作，接受上级卫生机关的指示。并与医院中的保健科保持联系，交流经验。如此，可达到在机关卫生工作中的“预防为主，治疗为辅，并建立两者间依存与联系的关系”的方针。优点有以下几项：
    （１）在公共卫生方面，按各机关具体情况，拟定计划及工作重点，包括干部周期体格检查，预防注射，改善环境卫生，改善伙食营养等，通过文化班给文化程度低，阅读能力弱的工作同志，做系统的卫生教育。上级卫生机关，则可编著通俗卫生刊物、读物，以对有阅读能力的工作同志们进行系统的卫生教育。进而改进个人卫生，及消灭有害的生活习惯。
    （２）在医疗方面，因门诊部医疗工作直接与医院取得联系，则在诊断治疗效果上，医务人员本身掌握业务能力上，及工作效率上，均可显著提高。药品的消耗可以减少，并可节省大部工作人员。（按我们机关门诊部工作人员为四十一人，每五十人中有一医务工作人员。其次七个月来初复诊共诊病九四○七次，医生有五人，平均每个医生每月平均诊病二六八·四次，合计每人每日诊病不及十次。）
    （３）在七个月初复诊总数九四○七次中，妇产科检查为三四次，占百分之○·三，比重甚小。五官科诊病次数较多，然大多为砂眼，及由砂眼所引起的病害。因此，这二科每周二次或三次，由该门诊部所被配属的医院之该科医生轮流门诊，即可解决自如。
