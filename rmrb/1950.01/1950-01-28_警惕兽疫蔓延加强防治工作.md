Be Vigilant Against the Spread of Animal Epidemics and Strengthen Prevention and Control Work
Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government

Recently, animal epidemics have become widespread, resulting in significant deaths. Thousands of farmers have lost their draft animals, which will greatly impact this year's spring plowing. Although various regions are urgently implementing prevention and control measures, the epidemic continues to spread. The current animal epidemic situation in various regions is described below by province:

Henan Province—Since April of last year, anthrax has occurred in draft cattle in Weishi, Chenliu, Luoning, and other counties. Due to the lack of timely prevention and control, it spread to Kaifeng, Dengxian, Nanyang, Fugou, Taikang, Shanzhou, Lushi, and sixteen or seventeen other counties. It has not stopped developing to this day, especially in the Nanyang area, which is the most severe. In Dengxian and Shanzhou alone, more than 3,300 cattle have died.

Chahar Province—Around December 20th, rinderpest broke out in cattle in Yanbei, Zuoyun, Datong, and other areas. As of now, nineteen head of cattle have died in sixteen villages in six districts of Datong. Thirty-seven head of cattle have died in nineteen villages in five districts of Zuoyun. Thirty-seven head of cattle have died in three districts of Youyu. Thirteen head of cattle have died in two villages in one district of Pinglu. Six head of cattle have died in six villages in three districts of Yanggao. Five head of cattle have died in two villages in two districts of Yingxian. Two head of cattle have died in Hunyuan. Two head of cattle have died in Shanyin. A total of 125 head of cattle have died in the above nine counties. In addition, rinderpest has also been found in Chicheng County in the southern part of the province. Two have already died, and the epidemic continues to spread.

Hebei Province—Anthrax has occurred in cattle in Pingxiang, Julu, Enxian, and other places in the province. More than 30 head of cattle died in seven villages, including Zhangwangding and Yangwuxiang, in the second district of Julu in half a month. Two hundred and fifteen head of cattle died in Pingxiang. Residents of Houwang Village in the ninth district of Enxian were infected with anthrax from eating the meat of sick cattle, and twenty-five people died.

Gansu Province—Rinderpest has occurred in the area of Yongdeng and Yongchang counties in the province. More than 600 head of cattle have died in the Zhenqiangtan area of Yongdeng County. The epidemic situation in the Huangchengtan area of Yongchang County is also very serious. Livestock in the pure pastoral areas near the Qilian Mountains are also suffering from this disease, and many have died.

Suiyuan Province—From the beginning of December last year to January 18th this year, rinderpest was discovered successively in eight counties, including Jining, Wudong, Longsheng, Taolin, Helin, Qingshuihe, Wuchuan, and Fengzhen, and four banners, including Zhenghong, Zhenghuang, Xianglan, and Siziwang. Forty head of cattle died in Jining, twenty-three head of cattle died in Zhenghong Banner, eight head of cattle died in Xianglan Banner, sixteen head of cattle died in Wudong County, three head of cattle died in Longsheng County, fifty-nine head of cattle died in Taolin, six head of cattle died in Helin, thirteen head of cattle died in Qingshui County, two hundred head of cattle died in Wuchuan County, and eight head of cattle died in Fengzhen. A total of 376 head of cattle died.

The above epidemics are mostly due to the failure to strictly block the spread after initial detection. The sale and movement of sick livestock has led to mutual infection and continuous transmission, resulting in a widespread disaster. For example, the anthrax in Hebei was spread by a cattle dealer from Houliuhang Village in Julu, who bought sick cattle from Luohe, Henan. The Yanbei rinderpest spread from Fengzhen to Zuoyun, and then was mutually transmitted by coal trucks in Kouquan, and then became popular in various places. Therefore, we must be highly vigilant and take the initiative to prevent it. Mobilize the masses, pay attention to improving livestock feeding management and cleanliness and hygiene. After the outbreak of the epidemic, special attention should be paid to disinfection and isolation. In areas bordering epidemic areas, the scope should be delimited and martial law should be implemented to prohibit the entry and exit and sale of livestock. In the work of animal epidemic prevention and control, various regions may formulate epidemic prevention regulations and strengthen epidemic reporting as appropriate. Districts and districts can establish joint prevention organizations according to the situation and concentrate their efforts to put out the fire.

    警惕兽疫蔓延加强防治工作
    中央人民政府农业部
    近来兽疫流行甚广死亡重大，数千农民因此失掉耕畜，对今年春耕影响极大，各地虽在紧急防治中但疫情仍在继续蔓延。兹将各地目前兽疫情况分省分述如下：
    河南省——自去年四月，尉氏、陈留、洛宁等县耕牛发生炭疽，因未及时防治，遂蔓延至开封、邓县、南阳、扶沟、太康、陕州、卢氏等十六七县。至今仍未停止发展，尤以南阳专区最重。仅邓县、陕州两地，即死牛三千三百余头。
    察哈尔——在十二月二十日前后，雁北、左云、大同一带发生牛瘟，截至现在为止，大同六个区十六个村死去十九头。左云五个区十九个村死去三十七头。右玉三个区死去三十七头。平鲁一个区二个村死去十三头。阳高三个区六个村死去六头。应县二个区二个村死去五头。浑源死去二头。山阴死去二头。以上九个县共死去一百二十五头。此外该省南部，赤城县亦发现有牛瘟。现已病死二头，其疫势仍在继续蔓延。
    河北省——该省平乡、巨鹿、恩县等地牛只发生炭疽。巨鹿二区张王町、杨五乡等七村半个月内即死牛三十余头。平乡死牛二一五头。恩县九区侯王村居民，因吃病牛的肉，被传染炭疽，死二十五人。
    甘肃省——该省永登、永昌二县一带已发生牛瘟。永登县镇羗滩区即死牛六百余头。永昌县皇城滩区疫情亦很严重。靠近祁连山纯牧区，牲牛染此病，死亡亦甚多。
    绥远省—从去年十二月初至今年一月十八日止，在集宁、武东、龙胜、陶林、和林、清水河、武川、丰镇等八县及正红、正黄、厢蓝、四子王等四旗，先后发现牛瘟，集宁死牛四十头，正红旗死牛二十三头，厢蓝旗死牛八头，武东县死牛十六头，龙胜县死牛三头，陶林死牛五十九头，和林死牛六头，清水县死牛十三头，武川县死牛二百头，丰镇死牛八头。共计死牛三百七十六头。
    以上疫情多因开始发现后封锁不严，病畜贩卖流动，互相感染，连接传播，乃至蔓延成灾。如河北的炭疽系由巨鹿后柳行村牛贩，自河南漯河买回病牛，开始传染。雁北牛瘟系由丰镇传至左云，再由口泉拉煤牛车互相传染，随即流行各地。因此应高度警惕主动预防。动员群众，注意改善牲畜饲养管理与清洁卫生。在发生疫病后，要特别注意消毒隔离。对疫区交界地区，更应划定范围，实行戒严禁绝牲畜出入买卖。在进行兽疫防治工作中各地可酌情定立防疫法规及加强疫情报告，区与区可根据情况建立联防组织集中力量扑灭。
