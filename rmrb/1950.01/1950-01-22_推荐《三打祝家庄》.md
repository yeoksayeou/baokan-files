    Recommendation of "The Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang"
    Ma Shaobo
    Comrade Wei Chenxu's adaptation of "The Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang" will be publicly performed by the Beijing Opera Research Institute at the Dazhong Theater on January 23rd. This revised version is the first performance in Beijing.
    "The Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang" is a collective creation of Comrades Li Lun, Wei Chenxu, and Ren Guilin in 1944. In the liberated areas, we understood "Driven to Join the Liangshan Rebels" as the beginning of a revolutionary period for old operas. Similarly, "The Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang," as Chairman Mao said, "consolidated the path of reform for Peking Opera." The facts also fully demonstrate its milestone role in the opera reform movement in the liberated areas, especially in the combination of materialist historical science and people's opera art.
    The theme of "The Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang" is very focused and clear. It uses the form of the Water Margin to write in a practical struggle. Through the class struggle between the insurgent peasants and the landlords in the Northern Song Dynasty, the strategic struggle in the Liangshanbo's attack on the feudal fortress of Zhujiazhuang provides realistic significance. For example, Song Jiang's ignorance of the enemy's military situation and rash advance, as well as his failure to isolate the enemy properly in policy, led to two setbacks. Finally, in "The Three Attacks," he strengthened political work, disintegrated the enemy's alliance, and made the underground work's struggle strategy effectively cooperate with the military combat, winning a major victory of "internal and external cooperation."
    The above themes, such as investigation and research, knowing yourself and your enemy, defeating them one by one, relying on the masses, and uniting the masses, still have a certain practical guiding significance today. In the widespread performances in various liberated areas in recent years, it has had a very good achievement in carrying out the ideological education of "wisdom and courage" for the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers and their cadres, and enlightening revolutionary wisdom.
    The revised version of "The Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang" is inevitably flawed, but it is undeniable that it is a successful work. It not only has a clear theme, but also appropriately uses the excellent techniques of old art. The political content and artistic image are relatively beautiful. When the Beijing opera community has already begun to take action, the performance of this opera has even greater significance!

    推荐《三打祝家庄》
    马少波
    魏晨旭同志改编的《三打祝家庄》，一月二十三日将由京剧研究院在大众剧场举行公演，这一修改本的演出，在北京还是第一次。
    《三打祝家庄》，是李纶、魏晨旭、任桂林三同志一九四四年的集体创作。在解放区，我们是把《逼上梁山》作为旧剧革命划时期的开端来理解的；那么《三打祝家庄》也正如毛主席所说的：“它巩固了平剧改革的道路”；事实也充分说明了它在解放区戏曲改革运动中，特别在唯物历史科学与人民戏曲艺术的结合方面，毫无疑问，有着里程碑的作用。
    《三打祝家庄》的主题思想，是很集中而明确的，它是利用水浒传形式，写入了一个实际斗争的内容，通过在北宋时代起义农民和地主的阶级斗争的基础上，所发生的梁山伯进攻封建堡垒——祝家庄战争中的策略斗争，提供了现实的意义。如宋江对敌人的军情不明、冒然进兵，以及在政策上没有把敌人弄到应有的孤立而遭受了两次挫折，终于在《三打》中加强了政治工作，分化了敌人的联盟，使地下工作的斗争策略有力的配合了军事战斗，赢得了“里应外合”的重大胜利。
    以上主题，比如调查研究、知己知彼、各个击破、依靠群众、团结群众等等，今天仍然存在着它一定的现实指导的意义。几年来在解放区各地广泛的演出中，它为广大的工农兵及其干部，进行对敌斗争“智勇双全”的思想教育，启发革命智慧，曾有着很好的成就。
    《三打祝家庄》的修改本，也难免还有缺点，但不可否认，总是一个成功的作品，它不仅有明确的主题思想，而且也适当的运用了旧艺术中的优秀技巧。政治内容和艺术形象，都是比较美好的。当目前北京戏曲界已开始行动起来的时候，这戏的演出，更有其重大的意义！
