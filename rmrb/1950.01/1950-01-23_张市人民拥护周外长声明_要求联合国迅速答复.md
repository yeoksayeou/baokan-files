    [Zhangjiakou Electric Dispatch] People from all walks of life in Zhangjiakou unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement to the United Nations demanding the expulsion of the remnant bandit representative Jiang Tingfu, and the Central People's Government's appointment of representatives to the United Nations. They deeply appreciate the internationalist spirit of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and withdrawing from various conferences within the United Nations organizations. They severely condemn the reactionary behavior of the US-British imperialist bloc in supporting the Kuomintang bandit gang. Wang Man, Director of the Zhangjiakou General Labor Union, said, "The Kuomintang bandit gang has become a group of desperate bandits. The government representing the Chinese people has already been established. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement is entirely in accordance with the will of the people of the whole country." Wang Defu, an old flour mill worker, said, "This righteous act by the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries fully demonstrates their sincere friendship towards the Chinese people." Li Shaofang, Deputy Director of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, stated, "The fact that imperialists such as the United States, Britain, and France still support the shameless running dog Jiang Tingfu, who represents absolutely no one, makes us more clearly recognize their true colors." In a joint public statement issued by the Hebei Provincial Women's Federation, the Zhangjiakou Women's Federation, the Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Student Federation, and the Youth Federation, it was unanimously pointed out that this political event further proves that Chairman Mao's teaching that "we must lean to one side" is completely correct. People from all walks of life have expressed that the United Nations should quickly respond to the demands of the Chinese people and immediately expel the remnant bandit delegation from all United Nations organizations.
