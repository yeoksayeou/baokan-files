    【This Newspaper News】After the Third District of Ninghe County, Hebei Province, suffered severe flooding last year, although they also led the disaster-stricken people in production for self-relief and distributed some relief grain, due to the leadership's lack of confidence in production and disaster relief, they did not delve into specifically helping the disaster-stricken people organize production. As a result, most of the disaster-stricken people have not yet started production, and their living problems cannot be solved. Since the autumn flood disaster in the district until now, only eight villages have organized more than 550 people to catch fish with winter nets; other production is scarce. The district's fishing and textile industries have not received leadership and assistance, and therefore have not been organized for production. Although the district has also distributed some loan grain, there have been many deviations due to the lack of in-depth work. In Shizhuangzi, 1,500 jin of loan grain was stored in the village for 40 days, and later only loaned to nine cadres and one member of the masses; three households did not use it for production.

    Because production has not been developed, many people have begun to blindly flee famine or sell livestock, dismantle houses, and sell furniture to maintain their lives. Except for the eight villages with fishing production, which can solve most of the disaster-stricken people's lives, the general villages mainly eat chaff and bran. According to the current living standards, 60 percent of the disaster-stricken people can survive until the Lunar New Year, while 40 percent of the disaster-stricken people cannot solve their current living problems. After inspection, the district found that the district cadres' leadership work was not in-depth, and some were not concerned about the suffering of the masses. Therefore, the county leadership has taken notice and is preparing to loan cotton to develop textiles. The Tianjin Special District has also instructed the county to take this district as a key area for leadership, equipping it with stronger and more cadres. In addition to effectively mobilizing disaster-stricken people to catch fish and spin yarn, attention should also be paid to the preservation of livestock. The government should provide a certain amount of material resources to loan forage and organize livestock to develop the transportation industry. Before the thawing period arrives, a portion of relief grain and spring wheat seeds should be distributed to tide over the thawing period and sow spring wheat, shortening the disaster period.

### 河北宁河县三区干部忽视领导救灾工作  天津专区指示加强领导

    河北宁河县三区干部忽视领导救灾工作
    天津专区指示加强领导
    【本报讯】河北省宁河县三区去年受到严重水灾后，虽也领导过灾民生产自救，发放了一些救济粮，但因领导上对生产救灾的信心不足，没深入下去具体帮助灾民组织生产，到现在大部灾民还没有生产起来，生活问题不能解决。该区自去秋水灾后到现在，只八个村组织起五百五十多人打冬网治鱼，别的生产很少。该区治鱼、纺织均未得到领导及帮助，因之都没有组织起来，进行生产。该区虽也发放了一部分贷粮，因工作不深入，出了不少偏差。史庄子贷粮一千五百斤，在村里存了四十天，后来只贷给了九个干部，一个群众，还有三户没用到生产上去。
    由于生产没搞起来，很多群众就开始盲目逃荒，或卖牲口、拆房、卖家具来维持生活。全区除有治鱼生产的八个村，可以解决灾民大部分生活外，一般村大部灾民，目前主要是吃糠吃麸子。按现在的生活水平，有百分之六十的灾民能维持到旧历年，百分之四十的灾民目前生活就没法解决。该区经过检查发现区干部领导工作不深入，还有个别的对群众痛苦不关心，因此，县领导上已提起注意，准备贷放棉花开展纺织。天津专区也指示到县，要把这个区做为重点进行领导。配备较强较多的干部，除切实发动灾民治鱼和纺线外，还要注意牲口的保存；政府要拿出一定物资力量贷放草料，和组织牲口开展运输业。在化冻期到来以前，要发放一部赈粮和春麦籽种，以渡过化冻期和种春麦，缩短灾期。
