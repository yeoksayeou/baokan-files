    Beijing Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Center Produces Seven New Products in Ten Months
    [Our Newspaper] In the ten months since liberation, the staff of the Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Center in Beijing have demonstrated initiative and creativity, successfully developing seven new products, increasing the output of epidemic prevention vaccines, and successfully completing the production tasks of smallpox vaccine and plague vaccine, powerfully supporting the government's epidemic prevention work.
    After liberation, the technical personnel and workers of the center carefully researched and overcame production difficulties, first producing toluene acetate and the preservative mercuric nitrate benzene used in the manufacture of penicillin. Subsequently, they successfully developed BCG vaccine, plague live bacteria vaccine, crystalline penicillin, pertussis serum, and typhus vaccine. In terms of production volume, compared with the highest record before liberation, toxoid production increased threefold, antitoxin increased twofold, and smallpox vaccine increased fivefold. The standards of general products are stricter than before, and the quality of vaccines has also been improved, reducing reactions.
    Starting last October, in order to cooperate with the government's plan to eliminate smallpox, they completed the plan to produce 30 million doses of smallpox vaccine in three months ahead of schedule within seventy days. When plague occurred in Chahar, the center received the government's task of urgently producing plague vaccine. All employees worked day and night, under the slogan of "Eliminating the plague north of the Great Wall," and quickly increased the production of plague vaccine within a short period of twenty days. In addition to supplying more than 4.4 million cubic centimeters to various places, they also stored 4.6 million cubic centimeters.
    In terms of reducing costs, the coal-burning workers saved about 100 tons of coal in ten months through various economies. The improved cultivation and refining of penicillin resulted in saving more than 300 liters of corn steep liquor, more than 3,000 liters of distilled water, more than 300 pounds of banana oil, and a portion of other raw materials. The vaccine room solved the problem of vaccine concentration, thus reducing the cost by half. The cost of smallpox vaccine was reduced by more than 30 percent due to the increase in the average yield per cow.
    Previously, the salaries of the center's employees were allocated by the government, and the operating income only maintained the operating expenses. Shortly after liberation, it was changed to enterprise management, reforming bad systems and implementing democratic management. From September last year, a cost accounting system was established, and economic accounting was implemented. Not only has it achieved complete self-sufficiency, but also accumulated funds due to production savings, making expanded reproduction possible. Now, a filtrable virus research laboratory, a typhus room, and a strain room have been added; isolation stables have been built; the small animal room has been expanded; and a breeding farm has been established in the western suburbs to breed guinea pigs, rabbits, and white mice in large quantities. It is planned to fully supply its own needs within two or three years, and further supply North China within three to five years.
    At the same time, the number of technical personnel has increased from the original 71 to 105. The ratio of technical personnel to administrative personnel has increased from 7:5 before liberation to the current 2:1.

    京天坛防疫处十个月中制成七种新产品
    【本报讯】解放后十个月来的天坛防疫处职工，发挥了积极性与创造性，研制成功七种新产品，提高了防疫菌苗的产量，胜利完成牛痘苗与鼠疫菌苗的生产任务，有力地配合了政府的防疫工作。
    该处技术人员与工人解放后精心研究，克服生产上的困难，首先制成了制造盘尼西林用的甲苯醋酸及防腐剂硝酸汞苯。其后研制成功的有卡介菌苗、鼠疫活菌菌苗、结晶盘尼西林、百日咳血清和斑疹伤寒菌苗。在生产量上，和解放以前最高纪录比较，类毒素产量增加了三倍，抗毒素增加了一倍，牛痘苗增加了五倍。一般制品的标准比以前严格了，菌苗还提高了质量，减低了反应。
    去年十月起，为了配合政府的消灭天花计划，七十天内提前完成了预定三个月制成三千万人份牛痘苗的计划。当察北发生鼠疫时，该处接到政府赶制鼠疫菌苗的任务，全体职工日以继夜，在“把鼠疫消灭在长城以北”的口号下，短短的二十天内，迅速提高了鼠疫菌苗产量，除供应了各地四百四十余万公撮外，还存储了四百六十万公撮。
    在减低成本方面，因为烧煤工人多方节约，十个月省了约一百吨煤。盘尼西林改进培养及提炼的结果节省了三百多公升玉黍浆、三千多公升蒸馏水、三百多磅香蕉油及其他原料一部。菌苗室解决了菌苗浓度问题，因而减低了成本的一半。牛痘苗因为每头牛平均产量的增加而减低成本百分之三十以上。
    以前，该处职工薪金由政府拨给，营业收入仅维持事业费用，解放后不久即改为企业化经营，改革不良制度，实行民主管理；去年九月开始已建立成本会计制度，实行经济核算。不但作到了完全自给自足，而且因为生产节约累积了资金，使扩大再生产成为可能，现已添设了滤过性毒研究室、斑疹伤寒室、菌种室；修建了隔离马舍；扩大了小动物室；在西郊设立了一个饲养场，大量繁殖天竺鼠、家兔及小白鼠等，计划在二三年内充分供给自己需要，三五年内进一步供给华北。
    同时技术人员由原有七十一人增至一百零五人。技术人员与事务人员的比例则由解放前七比五增至现在的二比一。
