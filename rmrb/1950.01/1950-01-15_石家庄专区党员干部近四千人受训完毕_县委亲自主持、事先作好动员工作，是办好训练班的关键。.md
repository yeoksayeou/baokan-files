    Nearly 4,000 Party Cadres in Shijiazhuang Prefecture Complete Training
    County Party Committees' Personal Leadership and Prior Mobilization are Key to Successful Training Courses.

    [This Newspaper reports] To date, the work of the Communist Party County Committees in training Party cadres in the counties of Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, has seen two sessions completed in Huolu, Pingshan, and Jianping counties, and the third session is now underway. Other counties have completed the first session and are holding the second. A total of 3,865 Party cadres have completed training, most of whom are branch secretaries and branch organization and propaganda committee members. The study period ranges from ten days to half a month, and the methods used are lectures, discussions, and criticism and self-criticism. The trained Party cadres have made progress in their ideological awareness and theoretical and policy levels. For example, in some villages, the land reform work was delayed due to disunity between new and old cadres, factionalism among cadres, and old cadres complaining and refusing to work. After studying how to be a good Party member and the policies on ending land reform and rectifying the Party, discussions and reviews were conducted, and the problems were appropriately resolved. In addition, many Party members had the erroneous idea of "half-baked revolution" and thought that communism meant "eating from a communal pot." After education, they gained a preliminary understanding of the future of social development and the bright prospects of communist society, and they understood that to achieve a happy communist society, they must do a good job in the current production and construction work. After more than 200 trained Party members in Lingshou returned to their villages, they immediately began to complete the work of ending land reform. After the first group of trained Party members in Pingshan returned, the branch education and living system was unprecedentedly strengthened. In grain requisitioning, fertilizer accumulation, and sideline production, they mostly took the lead, and the work showed a new look.

    Experience from the centralized training of Party cadres in various counties at this stage proves that equipping a strong leadership force and doing a good job of mobilization and preparation in advance are the basic keys to running a training class well. Most counties attach importance to this centralized training of Party cadres in terms of leadership ideology. A certain number of key cadres and general cadres were drawn to form a leading body, and in some counties the county party secretary personally presided over the training. The district party committee mobilized in the villages beforehand, so the training work went smoothly and the results were greater. Conversely, some counties neglected this work, failed to implement the instructions of the provincial and prefectural party committees to "draw one-third of the county party committee's strength" to be responsible for this work, and even no county party committee members participated, relying solely on a few general cadres to handle it, and did not do in-depth mobilization work in advance, resulting in an incomplete number of attendees, and the trainees who came were not at ease in their studies, so the training results were naturally not good.

    石家庄专区党员干部近四千人受训完毕
    县委亲自主持、事先作好动员工作，是办好训练班的关键。
    【本报讯】河北省石家庄专区各县中共县委训练党员干部的工作，到目前为止，获鹿、平山、建屏三县已有两期结业，现开始第三期；其他各县都结束了第一期，正举办第二期。总计已受训完毕的党员干部共三千八百六十五名，大部分是支部书记和支部组织、宣传委员。学习时间由十天到半月不等，方法是讲课与讨论以及批评与自我批评。受训后的党员干部，在思想觉悟和理论、政策水平上都提高了一步。如有的村因新老干部不团结，有的因干部间闹宗派，老干部发牢骚，不干工作，以致土地改革结束工作进行迟滞，这次学习了怎样做个好党员和结束土改与整党政策后，展开了讨论、检查，问题得到适当解决。另外，有不少党员存在“半截革命”思想和认为共产就是“吃大锅饭的”错误想法，经过教育后，初步了解了社会发展的前途和共产主义社会的光明远景，并懂得了要想达到幸福的共产主义社会，必须做好当前的生产建设工作。灵寿二百余受训党员回村后，结束土改工作马上展开了。平山第一期受训党员回去后，支部教育、生活制度空前健全起来，在征粮、积肥、副业生产中，他们大都带头先干，工作呈现了新气象。
    从这一阶段各县集训党员干部的经验证明：配备坚强领导力量和事前做好动员准备工作，是办好训练班的基本关键。大部县份在领导思想上对这次集训党员干部是重视的。抽出一定数量的主要干部和一般干部组成领导机构，有的县县委书记亲自主持；事前区委到村动员，这样训练工作的进行也就顺利，收获也较大；反之，有的县份忽视这个工作，未执行省委与地委“抽三分之一县委力量”负责此一工作的指示，甚至一个县委也未参加，单单靠几个一般干部去办，事先也未做深入地动员工作，以致人数来不齐，来的学员也不安心学习，训练收效自然不会好。（荫昌、稚风、永彬）
