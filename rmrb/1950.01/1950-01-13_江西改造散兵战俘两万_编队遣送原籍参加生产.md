　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 12th. Over the past five months, the Jiangxi Military Region of the People's Liberation Army has accommodated and re-educated over 20,000 disbanded soldiers, vagrants, and war prisoners. In the early days of liberation, disbanded soldiers and vagrants roamed throughout Jiangxi Province, affecting social order, with some even turning into bandits. To address this, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government and the Jiangxi Military Region issued a joint circular in early August of last year, instructing local people's governments to establish vagrant reception stations in towns along major transportation routes. The Jiangxi Military Region established a supplementary training division and an officers' corps, specifically to accommodate vagrants sent from various locations, organizing them into teams for short-term re-education. After short-term training, they were all properly resettled. Some even voluntarily requested to join the People's Liberation Army. Currently, in addition to a portion who continue to receive training and re-education, the majority have been provided with sufficient travel expenses and organized into teams according to province and county, collectively sent back to their native places to participate in production.

    江西改造散兵战俘两万
    编队遣送原籍参加生产
    【新华社南昌十二日电】人民解放军江西军区五个月来收容改造散兵、游勇、战俘达两万余名。江西省在解放初期，散兵游勇流散各地，影响社会治安，其中有一部分甚而流窜为匪。为此，江西省人民政府、江西军区曾于去年八月初通令各地人民政府在沿交通要道各城镇设立游散人员收容站；江西军区则设立补训师与军官大队，专门收容各地送来的游散人员，分别编队，予以短期教育改造。他们在经短期训练后都得到适当的安置。部分人员并自动要求参加人民解放军。现除一部分仍继续留训改造外，大部分都给以足够路费，按省、县地区编队集体遣送原籍参加生产。
