The Youth League Determines Specific Methods for Serving Production in Northeast China

Mobilize League members and young workers to actively produce, formulate production plans for League branches and League members, and coordinate with the broad masses of young workers and adult workers to formulate production plans for workshops and teams.

[This newspaper reports] In order to enable the Youth League cadres and the broad masses of League members in the industrial, mining, and railway sectors of Northeast China to further clarify the principle of serving production, and to determine specific methods for implementing this principle, the Youth Committee of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a region-wide conference on youth worker affairs in October of last year. Prior to the meeting, the Youth Committee spent a month preparing fully, conducting multiple research discussions, and sending work teams to Harbin, the Jixi Coal Mine, and Fushun to understand the situation, collect materials, and formulate a "Draft Plan for Youth League Work among Young Workers at Present." After discussion at the conference, a clear decision was made.

In the past year, nearly 40,000 new members have been developed among young workers in Northeast China. League organizations have been established in most public enterprises, and League members have played an active role in production, learning, and recreational activities, producing many heroic figures such as Zhao Guoyou. One of the main shortcomings of the League's work is that a very small number of comrades are not clear enough about the principle of the League serving production; some comrades are clear about the principle, but they are not clear about how to do it; some places have explored some experience, but have not been able to summarize it. This meeting initially solved these problems. Based on the current situation in Northeast China—economic construction is the overriding central task—the meeting determined that the League in industrial, mining, and railway sectors should conduct all its work and activities around production. There are three main specific tasks: First, to improve the political awareness of League members and young workers, actively produce, and carry out the movement to create new records in production. The political and ideological education of League members by League committees and branches at all levels should be conducted in conjunction with the Party's specific policies in each period and the problems that occur in the production process. At present, this should be centered on "carrying out a mass movement to create new production records." The League should take League members as the core and actively organize the broad masses of young workers to participate in the movement to create new records. The League should not only make general appeals, but also, under the guidance of administrative production plans and in coordination with trade union plans, formulate work plans for League branches and League members. It should not only ensure that each League member actively implements and completes the administrative production tasks, but also cooperate with the broad masses of young workers and adult workers to jointly formulate a production plan for a workshop or production team, becoming an active executor and promoter of completing the production plan.

	Adopting Methods Such As Respecting Teachers and Loving Apprentices to Improve the Skills of Young Workers

Second, improve the technical and cultural level of young workers. According to statistics from three branches of the Shenyang Machine Factory, among 1,060 young workers, apprentices account for 36.3 percent; most of the remaining skilled workers and technicians have also been recently promoted. Therefore, strengthening technical and cultural learning is a universal requirement of young workers, the most important personal interest of young workers, and the need for national development of production. According to current experience, there are three methods for doing so: One, widely promote respecting teachers and loving apprentices. Call on apprentices to respect their masters and adult workers, learn skills from them, and strengthen the unity of the working class. Overcome the phenomenon that some progressive young workers look down on their masters or adult workers. Various localities can try or promote the method of master-apprentice contracts; it is recommended that the administration establish examination and promotion methods to reward apprentices for learning skills. Two, promote mutual assistance and encourage inventions and creations. Call on technical young workers to help others learn skills; apprentices should take the initiative to learn skills from others. Educate young workers to respect and learn from workers who have made inventions and creations. The League should widely organize and promote new inventions and creations. Three, establish amateur technical learning organizations, such as amateur technical schools, apprentice classes, and technical learning groups. The conditions for running these learning organizations well are that they must first be actively advocated and assisted by the Party, government, and trade union, and that technical workers and technicians in the factory should be united to serve as teachers; the content of the teaching must also be combined with the needs of young workers in production, so at present it can only be tried out in a focused manner in places with the necessary conditions. At the same time, the League should attach importance to leading, organizing, and promoting the cultural learning of young workers, so as to lay the foundation for technical learning and political learning.

Third, care about the daily life of League members and young workers, and mobilize them to actively participate in the common welfare activities of all workers. The League should unite young workers to become active members in workers' cultural, recreational, and sports activities, so as to educate workers, restore fatigue, and enliven emotions; it should not be considered merely "playing or catching up with commemorative festivals." When organizing this work, emphasis should be placed on planning and organizing some short, collective, and daily activities that do not affect production and are conducive to production. The League should also care about and solve some of the personal problems of young workers in their daily lives, such as family disputes, marriage, hygiene, and wages.

In order to complete the above tasks and work, the meeting also decided to improve the League's leadership. In terms of leadership ideology, it should be clearly recognized that the work of the League among young workers is part of the entire workers' movement, and that it should closely cooperate with the trade union under the leadership of the Party. The yardstick for inspecting the work of the League is whether it can ensure the completion of the central work of the Party and government, whether it can closely cooperate with the trade union, whether League members become active members of the workers' movement, and whether it can further promote the workers' movement. Organizationally, the meeting also proposed: First, the youth worker minister of the League in each province and city should concurrently serve as the youth worker minister of the trade union; second, in industrial cities and mines, the League committee should not set up a youth worker department, but the secretary or deputy secretary of the League should attend the standing committee of the trade union; third, if the secretary of the League branch in the industrial and mining sector is not elected as a member of the factory management committee, he may attend the factory management committee as a non-voting delegate. This can guarantee the close relationship between the Youth League and all parties from an organizational point of view.

    青年团为生产服务东北确定具体作法
    发动团员与青年工人积极生产，订立团支部与团员生产计划，协同广大青年工人与成年工人订立车间小组生产计划。
    【本报讯】为使东北全区工矿铁路的青年团工作干部与广大团员进一步明确为生产服务的方针，并确定贯彻此方针的具体办法，中共中央东北局青委于去年十月召开了全区青年工人工作会议。会前青委曾以一月时间作充分准备，经多次研究讨论并派工作组赴哈尔滨、鸡西煤矿及抚顺了解情况，收集材料，制订“目前青工中团的工作草案”，经大会讨论，作出了明确的决定。
    一年来，东北区青年工人中已发展团员近四万人，大部分公营企业中已建立了团的组织，团员在生产学习及文娱活动上发挥了积极的作用，涌现了赵国有等许多英雄人物。团的工作的主要缺点之一，是有极少数同志对团为生产服务的方针还不够明确；有些同志在方针上是明确的，但是还搞不清如何做法；有些地方摸索出一些经验，但还未能加以总结。这次会议初步解决了这些问题。根据东北当前情况——经济建设是压倒一切的中心任务——会议确定团在工矿、铁路中应将一切工作与活动围绕着生产来进行。具体工作主要有三件：第一、提高团员与青年工人的政治觉悟，积极生产，开展创造新纪录运动。各级团委、支部对团员的政治思想教育，应结合党在各个时期的具体政策与生产过程中发生的问题来进行。在目前就以“开展群众性的创造生产新纪录运动”为中心内容。团应以团员为核心，积极组织广大青工们参加创造新纪录运动，团不仅作一般号召，应在行政生产计划指导之下，配合工会计划，订立团支部以及团员的工作计划，不仅要保证每个团员积极执行与完成行政的生产任务，同时应协同广大青年工人以及成年工人来共同订立一个车间或生产小组的生产计划，成为完成生产计划的积极执行与推动者。
            采尊师爱徒等方法提高青年工人技术
    第二、提高青年工人的技术文化水平。据沈阳机器厂三个分厂统计，一千零六十名青年工人中，徒工占百分之三十六点三；其余的熟练工与技工大部分也是最近提升的，因此加强技术与文化学习是目前青年工人的普遍要求，是青年工人最主要的切身利益，也是国家发展生产的需要。进行的方法，根据现在的经验，是有三种：一、广泛提倡尊师爱徒。号召徒工要尊敬师父和成年工友，向他们学习技术，加强工人阶级的团结。要克服目前有些进步青年工人看不起师父或成年工人的现象。各地可试行或推广师徒合同的办法；建议行政确定奖励徒工学习技术的考试升级办法。二、提倡互助与鼓励发明创造。号召技术青年工人能帮助别人学习技术；徒工主动的向别人学习技术。教育青年工人们尊敬与学习有所发明创造的工友。团应广泛的组织推广新的发明与创造。三、建立业余的技术学习组织，如业余技术学校、徒工班、技术学习组等。要办好这类学习组织的条件，首先必须得到党政工的积极提倡与帮助，要团结工厂中的技术工人和技师来当教员；教授的内容又要结合青年工人在生产中的需要，因此目前还只能在具有条件的地方去有重点的试办。同时，团应重视领导、组织、推动青年工人的文化学习，以为技术学习、政治学习创立基础。
    第三、关心团员和青年工人的日常生活，动员他们积极参加全体工人的共同福利事业活动。团应团结青年工人成为工人文娱体育活动中的积极分子，借以教育工人，恢复疲劳，活跃情绪；不能认为仅是“玩玩或赶纪念节日而已”。在组织这一工作时，应着重在有计划的组织一些短小的带集体性的日常的活动，使之不影响生产，而有利于生产。团还应关心与解决青年工人日常生活中的一些切身问题，如家庭纠纷、婚姻、卫生、工资等。
    为了完成上述任务与工作。会议并决定改进团的领导。在领导思想上应明确认识团在青年工人中的工作是整个工人运动的一部分，要在党的领导下密切与工会合作。检查团的工作的尺度，就看是否能保证完成党政中心工作，能密切的与工会合作，团员成为工人运动中的积极分子，并进而能对工人运动有所推进。在组织上，会议并提议：一、各省市团的青工部长兼任工会的青工部长；二、在工业城市和工矿的团委，不设青工部，由团的书记或副书记出席工会的常委会；三、工矿团支部书记未当选为工厂管委会委员者，可列席工厂管委会。这样能从组织上来保证青年团密切与各方面的关系。
