    [This newspaper's report] The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank recently summarized its loan business for 1949. It issued a total of 37,859,310,000 yuan in loans, benefiting a total of 9,350 public and private enterprises, industrial and mining operations, commercial entities, cultural undertakings, and agricultural, sideline, and handicraft industries. Except for a few households that used the loans for speculation, it was generally confirmed upon inspection that the funds were used for production. Therefore, the loans played a direct supporting role in the recovery and development of Beijing's production. Since the bank began operations in March of last year, it has steadily developed this business with a cautious attitude. Initially, the loans were focused on supporting public enterprises, and after June, private enterprises became the primary focus of lending. In terms of loan methods, in addition to monetary loans, methods such as "folding real value" (折实) and ordering were also tested. The overall principle was to be conducive to the development of production. The enterprises managed by the Municipal Industry Bureau were piles of scrap when they were taken over from the enemy. With the support of bank loans, not only have they generally recovered, but they have also added some machinery and equipment. The trolley bus company's completion of the second "100-bus plan" in a short period after the fire is also related to this. In the private industrial sector, many factories were able to recover and develop only with the support of loans from the People's Bank. The recovery and development process of the Dazhong Weaving and Dyeing Factory, the Siwei Coal Mine, and specialized handicrafts all illustrate this point.
    Many private factories have obtained loans, solved the difficulties of funds and raw materials, and further increased equipment and expanded production.
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China has supported private enterprises through loans. From April to the end of December of last year, a total of 9,043 households received loans totaling 50,034,500,000 yuan. The private enterprises in Beijing generally have a small scale and weak capital. With the support of loans from the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China or the "folding real value" (折实) method of releasing loans, they were able to circulate funds, tide over the off-season, and avoid shutdowns, thereby embarking on the road to recovery and development. For example, the Jingwei Weaving Factory often stopped work due to lack of funds after liberation. After two loans in July and September of last year, raw materials could be supplied in time, production was normal, and output increased. The Jianguo Iron Factory successively obtained seven loans last year, totaling more than 140 million yuan, and purchased 199 tons of iron, so production was never interrupted. By November, output broke the previous record, increasing from 3 tons of pig iron per day to 4 tons. Some factories have expanded production and added equipment after receiving loan support. For example, the Dazhong Weaving and Dyeing Factory received six loans, repaired five manual machines, and purchased ten electric machines, doubling its productivity. The Zhongxing and Siwei coal mines in Mentougou were able to continue coal production and successfully overcome the off-season after receiving bank loans. Beijing's export of specialized handicrafts has been restored with bank loans. Before the liberation of Beijing, the industry was on the verge of complete shutdown. After liberation, the bank successively loaned 250 million yuan to 598 households, enabling more than 240 households that had been closed or switched industries to resume operations. The households that had been shut down with stockpiles of semi-finished products were also able to make finished products. The total export value of the industry in the second half of last year reached more than 700,000 US dollars.

    京人民分行总结贷款业务  公私受益户九千余
    【本报讯】人民银行北京分行近总结一九四九年贷款业务，总共发放贷款达三、七八五、九三一万元，受益的公私营企业、工矿、商业、文化事业、及农副业、手工业等共九三五○户。其中除个别户曾以贷款进行投机活动外，经检查，一般都确是用于生产的。故贷款对京市生产的恢复与发展起了直接的扶植作用。该行自去年三月开始建行后，即以慎重的态度稳步开展这一业务，贷款扶植的对象起初为公营企业，六月份以后开始对私营企业作重点贷款。贷款方式上，除货币贷款外，并曾试用折实、订货等方式。其总的原则是有利于发展生产。市工业局领导经营的各企业从敌人接收过来时是一堆破烂摊子，经过银行贷款扶植，不但一般的恢复起来，并且增加了部分机器和设备。电车公司失火事件后又在短期内完成了第二次百辆计划与此亦有关系。在私营工业方面，更有许多工厂是在人民分行贷款扶植之下才得到恢复和发展。大众织染厂、四维煤矿，以及特种手工业的恢复与发展过程，都说明这一点。
    不少私营工厂获得贷款，解决了资金原料困难，进而增修设备，扩大生产。
    【北京讯】中国人民银行北京分行贷款扶植私营企业，自去年四月至十二月底止，贷款者共九千零四十三户，贷款共达人民币五十亿零三百四十五万元。北京市的私营企业，一般的规模很小，资金薄弱，一年来在中国人民银行北京分行贷款或折实订货放款的扶植下，使他们能周转资金，渡过淡月，避免了停工，从而走上恢复与发展的道路。如经纬织布厂在解放后，因资金缺乏常常停工待料，去年七月、九月两次贷款后，原料能及时供应，生产正常，产量增加。建国铁厂去年先后贷款七次共一亿四千余万元，买铁一百九十九吨，生产因而从未中断，到十一月份，产量更突破以前的纪录，由日产元铁三吨增加到四吨。有些工厂得到贷款扶植后，扩大生产，增建设备，如大众织染厂贷款六次，修理了五台人力机，购买了十台电力机，生产力提高一倍。门头沟中兴、四维等煤矿，经银行贷款后才能继续出煤，顺利渡过了淡月。北京市出口的特种手工业更是得到银行贷款而恢复起来的，北京解放前该业已濒于全部停工，解放后银行先后贷给五百九十八户人民币二亿五千余万元，使二百四十多户已停业或转业的又重新经营起来，堆积着半成品而停业的各户也得以制成成品，该业去年后半年产品出口总值共达七十余万美汇。
