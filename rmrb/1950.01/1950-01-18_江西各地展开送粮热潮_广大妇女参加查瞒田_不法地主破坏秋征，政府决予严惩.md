    [This Newspaper Reported] Jiangxi Province has largely distributed the public grain quotas to households by late December, and a rapid grain delivery campaign is underway. After initial mobilization, working women in various areas are also actively participating in evaluation, investigating hidden land, urging grain delivery, and transporting grain. Lei Duodi, a working woman from Xiaolin Township, Fourth District of Fengcheng, was selected as a county representative in the women's association. During grain collection, she not only paid her share first but also encouraged others to pay. She went from one security unit to another, from her village to neighboring villages, participating in meetings to promote the people's government's policy of reasonable burden for grain collection. She also challenged representatives from other security units, guaranteeing to mobilize the masses to uncover landlords' concealed land, ensuring fair and reasonable burdens, and completing the grain delivery task. Under her influence and promotion, women in the township also actively organized and participated in tasks such as investigating hidden land and evaluating yields, enthusiastically joining the grain delivery campaign. Zou Fengxiu, a liberated woman from the Second Security Unit of Baotong Township, Yongxiu County, not only uncovered a large amount of hidden land during grain collection but also discovered hidden grain, exposing the landlords' conspiracy to feign poverty and play tricks. During grain delivery, more than forty women members of the village voluntarily participated in transportation. Simultaneously, influenced by the women in this village, women in neighboring villages also actively participated in grain delivery. Three hundred and fifty working women from Qili Township, Fourth District of Jinxian, participated in anti-concealed land efforts and grain transportation. The women's association and team leaders in each village patiently notified each grain-delivering household every morning and frequently supervised the start of transportation and checked grain delivery receipts. When the landlord Wang Qiying attempted to evade the burden and escape across the river, the women chased him barefoot for more than ten miles and finally dragged him back. After organization and mobilization, more than two hundred women members of Luoxi Township, Sixth District of Taihe County, actively participated in grain collection work and played a significant role.
    As the grain collection movement unfolds vigorously, a small number of unlawful landlords and rich peasants are stubbornly resisting and sabotaging it by using various deceptive, intimidating, and rumor-mongering tactics. The People's Governments of Chongren, Nancheng, and Jinxi counties are exposing these tactics and mobilizing the masses to struggle against them. Landlord power-holders are spreading rumors and threats, which can be summarized in the following forms: (1) Misinterpreting the people's government's policy of reasonable burden and spreading rumors that after the public grain is collected, cotton quilts and clothing will also be levied. (2) Threatening and luring backward elements, winning over representatives of peasant congresses, and inviting representatives of street leaders to eat and drink. Some landlords are secretly transporting large quantities of grain and property. (3) Openly resisting grain delivery, such as the landlord Xiong Sibao from Mianxu Township, First District of Chongren, who was supposed to deliver 9,000 catties but only delivered 3,000 catties, hiding and selling the rest. When village cadres went to urge grain delivery, he incited his wife to beat the village cadres. (4) Using gang and clan relationships to collectively conceal land and spread shameless rumors to deceive the masses. For example, when cadres in Nancheng City discovered that a landlord had concealed more than 3,000 catties of grain, he had the masses come out and deny it, and active elements did not dare to speak out, and he attempted to delay the time so that the task could not be completed. To successfully complete the grain collection task, the governments of the above three counties, in addition to exposing rumors and vigorously publicizing policies, are also mobilizing and organizing the masses to struggle against them and punishing individual ringleaders.

    江西各地展开送粮热潮
    广大妇女参加查瞒田
    不法地主破坏秋征，政府决予严惩
    【本报讯】江西全省公粮至十二月下旬已大部分配到户，并迅速展开送粮热潮，各地劳动妇女经初步发动后，亦积极参加评议、查黑田、催粮、送粮等工作，丰城四区小淋乡的劳动妇女雷多弟，在妇女会中被选为县代表后，征粮中不但自己先缴，并推动别人交粮。她从这一保到那一保，从本村到邻村，参加开会宣传人民政府的征粮合理负担政策，她并向别的保代表们提出挑战，保证发动群众，查出地主瞒田，做到负担公平合理，完成送粮任务，该乡妇女在她影响和推动下，亦积极组织起来，参加查黑田评产量等工作，并热烈的卷入送粮热潮。永修县抱桐乡二保翻身妇女邹凤秀在征粮中不但查出地主的大量黑地，还查出地主隐藏的粮食，揭破了地主装穷耍赖的阴谋。送粮中该村四十多位妇女会员自动参加运输。同时，在该村妇女的影响下，邻村的妇女也积极参加了送粮。进贤四区七里乡三百五十位劳动妇女参加了反瞒田、运粮等工作，各村妇女会和组长们，不但每天早晨耐心的通知各送粮户，并经常督促起运和检查送粮收据。地主王奇英企图逃避负担，过河逃跑，妇女就赤脚过河追了十几里，终于把地主拖回来。泰和县六区螺溪乡的二百多个妇女会员，经过组织和发动后，积极参加征粮工作，亦起了很大作用。
    在征粮运动澎湃展开之际，少数不法地主富农利用各种欺骗、恫吓、造谣伎俩顽抗破坏。崇仁、南城、金溪等县人民政府正予以揭露，发动群众进行斗争。地主当权派造谣威胁，综合起来有下列几种形式：（一）曲解人民政府的合理负担政策，并造谣说公粮征过后，还要派棉被棉衣等。（二）威胁拉拢落后分子。拉拢农代会代表，并请代表街长吃酒吃饭，有部分地主暗中将粮食财产大批运走。（三）公开抗粮不缴，如崇仁一区沔浒乡地主熊四保应负担九千斤，他只缴了三千斤，其余的隐藏与出卖，村干部去催粮时，他唆使他老婆把村干部打了。（四）利用帮会宗族关系集体瞒田，并造无耻谣言，欺骗群众，如南城城区干部查出某地主瞒田三十多担，他就让群众出来否认，积极分子也不敢发言，并企图拖延时间，使任务不能完成。上述三县政府，为了胜利完成征粮任务，除揭露谣言，大力宣传政策外，并发动与组织群众向其斗争，对个别首恶分子则予以惩办。
