Naked barley is a type of barley (i.e., grass barley). It is called naked barley because its kernels are exposed. In some areas, it is called exposed kernel green naked barley, jade barley, etc. Its cultivation method is the same as that of barley, but its value is greater than that of barley. Its advantages are introduced below, in the hope that various regions will study and try to promote it where appropriate.

	Advantages of Naked Barley
	I. Watery land, shady land, or mountain land, that is, areas where barley or oats can be grown, can all be planted. (II) In the past, when there was no shortage of grain, planting barley could be used for making koji (fermented starter for alcohol), but now, due to the lack of grain and restrictions on distilling alcohol, the use of koji has decreased. Most of the barley is used as food grain, so eating naked barley is more cost-effective and tastier than eating barley. (III) The yield is more than double that of wheat, and it matures early, so two crops can be planted. After harvesting naked barley, small millet can also be planted. In mountainous areas where oat seeds are scarce, it can also be planted (in mountainous areas, the planting season for naked barley is the same as that for oats, so only one crop can be planted). (IV) The yield is about the same as barley, but it produces more flour. Each market dou (a unit of dry measure) can be ground into twelve jin (a unit of weight) of flour, while barley can only be ground into ten jin of flour. If a person can eat one jin of barley flour, they can be satisfied with twelve liang (a unit of weight, smaller than jin) of naked barley flour. (V) In recent years, people in various regions, such as Xing County, Jingle, and Xin County, have been automatically planting it. The price of naked barley seeds is the same as that of millet, so in terms of price, naked barley should also be planted, because naked barley can replace fine grains, while barley can only replace coarse grains. This year, Xing County purchased two market shi (a unit of dry measure, larger than dou) of naked barley seeds from Lin County and planted them near Chengguan, and the harvest was very good.

	Points to Note When Planting
	I. Naked barley seeds are hard. Soak them in cold water overnight the day before planting to promote germination.
	II. Plant three to five days later than the planting season for barley, because the seedlings are afraid of frost after emergence. If they are frosted, some seedlings may not produce ears.
	III. In areas where there is no tradition of planting, you can first try planting a small portion and learn from experienced people.
	IV. Some people say that in dry weather, some seedlings may not produce ears.
	V. Black smut disease is not very important, but when planting, the seeds need to be treated like barley seeds to avoid disease. It is best to soak them in warm water (two parts boiling water, one part cold water) for five minutes (that is, the time it takes to burn six-tenths of a yellow incense stick), which is relatively safe.

    裸麦
    山西第一农场  段炽华
    裸麦是大麦（即草麦）的一种，因为它的颗粒露着，所以叫裸麦，有的地区叫露仁子青裸大麦、玉麦等。它的栽培法，和大麦一样，但比大麦的价值大，兹将它的优点介绍于下，希各地加以研究试行适地推广。
            裸麦的优点
    一、水地背阴地或山地，即能种大麦或莜麦的地区，都可以种植。（二）过去在粮食不缺的时候，种上大麦可以踩曲，但现在因粮食缺乏，限制蒸酒的时候，曲的用途减少，大部分的大麦都是作为食粮用，所以吃裸麦比吃大麦合算，而且又好吃。（三）产量比小麦大一倍以上，成熟期早，可以种两茬，即收裸麦后，还可以种小谷子，山地区莜麦籽缺乏的地区也可以种（山地区种裸麦和种莜麦的时期一样只能种一茬）。（四）产量和大麦差不多，但出麦多，每市斗能磨面十二斤，大麦仅能磨面十斤，如能吃大麦面一斤的人，裸麦面十二两，就可以吃饱。（五）近几年来各地区，如兴县，静乐，忻县等地的群众，都自动的种植，裸麦的种子和小米的价钱一样，所以按价钱来说，也应种裸麦，因为裸麦能顶细粮，大麦则顶粗粮。今年兴县由临县购到裸麦种籽二市石，在城关附近种植收获很好。
            种植时应注意的几点
    一、裸麦种籽坚硬，在种的前一天晚上，可用冷水浸一夜，促进它的发芽。
    二，比种大麦的时期迟种三五日，因出苗后怕冻，如冻了时，有的苗子有不出穗的情形。
    三、如向来没有习惯的地区，可先试种一部分，并向有经验的人学习。
    四、有人说遇天旱时，有的苗子有不出穗的情形。
    五、黑穗病不甚要紧，但种植时，需要和种大麦一样，处理种子，以免发病害，最好用温水浸（两份开水，一份冷水的温水）五分钟（即烧黄香六分长的时间），比较保险。
