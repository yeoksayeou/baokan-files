Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 10th: The "Truth" newspaper published Viktorov's international commentary on the 8th, pointing out the diplomatic victories achieved by the People's Republic of China.

Viktorov wrote: The Chinese people have overthrown the reactionary, semi-feudal Kuomintang regime and liberated their country from the shackles of imperialist oppression. This epoch-making victory of the Chinese people has fully and in a new way raised the issue of relations between China and other countries in the world. The victorious communist construction of the Soviet Union and the strengthening of the anti-imperialist camp have been and will continue to be of great importance to the consolidation and strengthening of the international status of the People's Republic of China. At the beginning of its establishment, the People's Republic of China made it clear that its position was on the side of the anti-imperialist camp—the camp of fighters for peace and democracy.

Viktorov pointed out: The Soviet Union was the first country to establish friendly relations with the People's Republic of China. Following the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries also established friendly relations with the new people's democratic China.

But on the one hand, the people of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries welcomed the epoch-making victory of the great Chinese people with great joy, and on the other hand, the rulers of the imperialist camp had a very opposite reaction. All imperialist newspapers, especially American newspapers, angrily demanded that the People's Republic of China not be recognized.

American imperialists continue to give Chiang Kai-shek military assistance and plan to consolidate the Kuomintang's reactionary fortresses on Hainan Island and Taiwan. The Washington correspondent of the British Conservative newspaper "Observer" reported on January 1st that American munitions are continuing to be shipped to Taiwan. Viktorov pointed out: The American reactionary press is stepping up its campaign against the People's Republic of China, trying to exert pressure on other capitalist countries to prevent them from establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

But this movement did not achieve its goal. The major partners in the Anglo-American group will not reach a consensus on the issue of relations with the People's Republic of China. Britain and several other countries in the British Empire, such as India, Pakistan, and Ceylon, are willing to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and sever diplomatic relations with Yan Xishan's so-called government.

Viktorov further pointed out: The American reactionary group not only continues to oppose the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, but also insists on adhering to the old adventurous policies and further supporting the bankrupt Kuomintang group.

Obviously, the lessons they have learned are not enough for them. The author emphasized: Then, history will give them better lessons in the future. People's democratic China is fully determined to liberate all Chinese territories, including Hainan Island, Taiwan, and Tibet. It is obvious that this task will be carried out.

Viktorov finally said: The establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and Britain and other capitalist countries powerfully proves that the plans of the imperialist groups who still dream of restoring colonial rule in China have failed, and it shows that the international status of the People's Republic of China is increasing day by day.

    真理报国际述评
    论中英建立外交关系
    证明中国国际地位日益增强
    【新华社北京十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报八日登载维克托罗夫的国际述评中，指出中华人民共和国在外交方面所获得的胜利。
    维克托罗夫写道：中国人民已推翻了反动的、半封建的国民党政权，并把他们的国家从帝国主义压迫的枷锁下解放出来。中国人民的这种划时代的胜利，以充分的程度并以新的方式，提出了中国与世界其他国家间的关系问题。苏联胜利的共产主义建设，和反帝国主义阵营力量的壮大，对于中华人民共和国的国际地位的巩固与加强，过去是将来也仍然是具有巨大的重要性的。中华人民共和国在初成立时，即明白表示：它的地位是在反帝国主义阵营——争取和平与民主的战士的阵营的一边。
    维克托罗夫指出：苏联是第一个与中华人民共和国建立友好关系的国家。跟随在苏联之后，人民民主国家亦与新的人民民主中国建立友好关系。
    但是一方面，苏联及人民民主国家的人民以极大快乐的心情，欢迎伟大的中国人民的划时代胜利，而另一方面，帝国主义阵营的统治者们则有十分相反的反应。所有帝国主义的报纸，首先美国的报纸怒气冲冲地要求不承认中华人民共和国。
    美国帝国主义者继续给蒋介石军事援助，并计划巩固国民党在海南岛与台湾的反动堡垒。英保守党报纸“观察报”驻华盛顿记者在一月一日报道：美国军火正继续不断地运至台湾。维克托罗夫指出：美国反动报界正在加紧进行反对中华人民共和国的运动，力图对其他资本主义国家施加压力，阻止它们与中华人民共和国建立外交关系。
    但这个运动并没有达到它的目标。英美集团中的主要伙伴对中华人民共和国之间的关系问题，不会取得一致的意见。英国和英帝国的其他若干国家，如印度、巴基斯坦及锡兰，它们已愿意与中华人民共和国建立外交关系，并与阎锡山的所谓政府断绝外交关系。
    维克托罗夫进一步指出：美国反动集团不仅继续反对与中华人民共和国建立外交关系，而且坚持必须坚守旧有的冒险政策，并进一步支持破产的国民党集团。
    显然的，他们所得的教训对他们是不够的。作者着重地说：那末，历史以后将会给予他们更好的教训。人民民主中国有充分的决心，要解放中国全部领土，其中包括海南岛、台湾及西藏。这一任务将被执行，是十分明显的。
    维克托罗夫最后称：中华人民共和国与英国及其他资本主义国家间建立外交关系，有力地证明了那些仍梦想在中国恢复殖民地政权的帝国主义集团的计划已遭到失败，并且说明中华人民共和国的国际地位正日益增强。
