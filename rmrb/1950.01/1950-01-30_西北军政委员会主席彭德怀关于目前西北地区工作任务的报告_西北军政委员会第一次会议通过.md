Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 29th:

The five provinces of Northwest China have been completely liberated. This is the glorious result of the long-term and arduous struggle of the People's Liberation Army, the people of Northwest China, and the people of the whole country, and it is also the victory of the great, wise, and people's leader Chairman Mao Zedong's line. From now on, the five provinces of Northwest China will enter a new period of peaceful construction. All ethnic groups in the Northwest should unite closely, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and strive to build a new Northwest. Based on the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the situation in the Northwest, the current work tasks in the Northwest region are proposed as follows:

(1) The People's Liberation War in the Northwest region has come to a victorious end. Our new task should be to thoroughly eliminate bandits, wipe out special agents, implement democratic reforms, mobilize all forces, practice thrift, overcome difficulties, and restore and develop production. In the old liberated areas, that is, the original Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the land problem has been solved, and all efforts should be used to restore and develop production. In the semi-old liberated areas, such as the Huanglong sub-district, we should continue to mobilize the masses and complete the work of land distribution. In the newly liberated areas, in addition to paying attention to urban work, we must use great efforts to mobilize the broad masses of the people in the countryside to carry out democratic reforms. The first step is to eliminate bandits, wipe out special agents, oppose local bullies, carry out rent reduction, and weaken feudal forces; then the second step, according to the actual development and the level of awareness and organization of the masses, is to carry out land reform and eliminate the feudal system.

(2) From the autumn harvest of 1950 to the spring plowing of 1951, land reform should be carried out in most areas of Shaanxi, parts of Gansu and Ningxia provinces, and individual areas of Qinghai, to gain experience, universally educate cadres and the masses, and prepare to complete the land reform in the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia and basically complete the land reform in Qinghai Province from the autumn harvest of 1951 to the spring plowing of 1952. Land reform will not be carried out for the time being in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities and areas where various ethnic groups live together. When to carry out land reform will depend on the level of awareness of the people of all ethnic groups and the actual development of the local situation. However, in the agricultural areas of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai inhabited by both Hui and Han nationalities, land reform may also be carried out at the same time when conditions are ripe, depending on the circumstances. Before land distribution, all land owned by landlords and rich peasants still belongs to landlords and rich peasants; farmers who rent land from landlords and rich peasants should reduce rent and pay rent according to the rent reduction regulations promulgated by the government, reducing the original rent by 25% to 30%. When distributing land, the land of middle peasants should not be touched at all, and the land, draught animals, farm implements, and rural houses connected to the land owned by landlords should be confiscated and the surplus land, draught animals, and farm implements of rich peasants should be requisitioned and distributed to farmers who have no land or little land. There must be no acts of chasing after hidden wealth or implementing the method of sweeping people out of their homes. The industrial and commercial enterprises run by landlords and rich peasants should be protected and must not be confiscated or damaged under any pretext. Landlords must also be allocated land of the same quantity and quality as farmers. In carrying out the above work, people's representatives conferences and peasant representatives conferences at all levels must be convened to announce government policies and decrees, educate the people, and strictly abide by government policies and decrees, so that rural land reform work can be carried out enthusiastically and orderly on the basis of the awareness of the peasant masses. When dealing with criminals, all procedures must be in accordance with legal procedures, that is, tried by the people's judicial organs, or by temporary people's courts organized by specially assigned personnel designated by the higher-level government in accordance with the law. If the death penalty is to be imposed, it must be approved by the people's government above the provincial level. Resolutely abolish torture and other acts of insulting prisoners. In order to prepare for the work of land distribution, we must plan and train cadres very carefully, mobilize and organize the peasant masses well, convene district and township peasant representative conferences, systematically introduce the experience and lessons of land reform in the old liberated areas, and reprint and repeatedly discuss "How to Analyze Class." This district and township peasant representative conference shall be organized and established by the mass meeting of all working people and revolutionary intellectuals in each village to elect representatives, and shall exercise the functions and powers of the district and township people's congress, and shall be the legal executive organ for rural land reform. All major tasks and reasonable burdens that should be promoted and reformed in districts and townships should be discussed by the peasant representative conference. If administrative personnel in each district and township have illegal acts and do not change after criticism and education, the peasant representative conference has the right to report to the higher-level people's government to remove them, in order to establish the foundation of the rural people's democratic power.

(3) In a certain period, the economic construction of the Northwest region should focus on agriculture and animal husbandry. In terms of agriculture, we must improve the enthusiasm of farmers for production, improve seeds and farming methods, restore and develop water conservancy, and pay attention to the protection and cultivation of forests and grasslands, and prevent and control disasters, in order to achieve the task assigned to us by the Central People's Government in 1950: to increase the production of coarse grains by 330 million catties and to increase the production of ginned cotton by 120,000 dans. The livestock production in Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces should not be lower than the level of 1949. To this end, we must pay attention to training veterinary cadres, and set up veterinary stations and mobile epidemic prevention teams in key areas of animal husbandry, and actively carry out livestock improvement.

In terms of industry and transportation, we must build the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, repair the Tianshui-Baoji section of the railway, and repair the main highways destroyed by the enemy. We must focus on the production of the Yumen Oil Factory and restore the production of the Ulan Oil Factory, develop the Xiangtang Oil Mine as much as possible, increase power, develop cotton and wool textile and leather industries, and strengthen planning and organization in production, improve output and quality, take care of machinery, and save raw materials, in order to reduce costs and expand sales. To improve these tasks, we must first rely on improving the political awareness of the working class, uniting technical personnel, and working together to gradually realize them. Private enterprises that are beneficial to the people should be protected and their development promoted. In terms of finance and trade, we must promote the exchange of goods, strive to stabilize prices, and all measures must serve the restoration and development of production. In terms of overcoming financial difficulties, we must complete the various tax revenue tasks stipulated by the Central People's Government, vigorously promote public bonds, strictly establish various financial revenue and expenditure systems, reorganize institutions, verify the number of people, stop all unnecessary expenditures, maintain the style of hard struggle, launch a comprehensive large-scale production movement, and personnel in organs and schools should also practice amateur production; practice thrift, strictly prohibit corruption, and oppose extravagance and waste. These are the effective ways to overcome the financial and economic difficulties after the war. The Northwest Finance and Economics Committee should have specific plans to gradually realize them. At the same time, we must pay close attention to disaster relief work. Due to natural disasters and poor harvests last year, war damage, and the looting by Kuomintang bandit troops, the people's burden could not be reduced for a while, resulting in a serious spring famine, and individual areas have already experienced a winter famine. Governments at all levels must immediately mobilize and organize the people to produce for self-rescue, help each other, advocate fair and free lending in rural areas, and ensure that loans are repaid. Organize production and marketing cooperative undertakings, encourage the export of local products, exchange for food and daily necessities, and prohibit brewing and sugar making in food-deficient areas. Call on all military and government personnel to save one or two taels of grain per day to relieve the spring famine, and adopt all effective measures to ensure that no one starves to death.

(4) In the long-term struggle, the People's Liberation Army, in addition to eliminating the enemy, also carried out local work, built revolutionary base areas, actively produced, reduced the burden on the people, and overcame the financial and economic difficulties in the war. This is the excellent tradition of the People's Liberation Army. Now that the five provinces of Northwest China have been completely liberated, they are carrying out winter training, suppressing bandits, and doing local work, and are actively preparing for production. According to the different conditions in various places, they are preparing to reclaim wasteland, build water conservancy projects, build railways and highways, etc., and are prohibited from engaging in commerce. For the results of production, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on the army's participation in production and construction work, we will implement both public and private interests. Forty percent of the production bonus will be owned by the individual producers, and the rest will be owned by the production unit and the state. More than 100,000 troops stationed in Xinjiang are participating in production, preparing to reclaim 600,000 mu of wasteland. With a yield of 5 dou per mu, 300,000 shi of grain can be obtained; planting 50,000 mu of cotton, with a yield of 20 jin per mu, 1 million jin of cotton can be obtained. It is estimated that more than 400,000 troops stationed in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces will participate in production. This large production army has a high degree of political awareness and past production experience. It is believed that they will resolutely, bravely, and victoriously complete the production tasks just like completing combat tasks. In this large-scale production movement, many labor heroes will emerge, playing a leading role in production, and they are as glorious as combat heroes.

(5) In 1950, the people's representatives conferences at all levels in each province, city, and county must be convened in accordance with the organizational rules of the people's representatives conferences of all circles promulgated by the Central People's Government. The people's representatives conferences at all levels are the best organizational form for mobilizing and uniting all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and the people of all ethnic groups. Through the representatives conferences, policies are disseminated to the broad masses of the people, so that the people's government is closely linked with the people, and the people's political awareness is improved, so as to facilitate the completion of various work tasks and make the people's democratic dictatorship and the people's democratic united front more consolidated and complete in organization. The people's representatives conferences of all circles in each city and county should gradually exercise the functions and powers of the people's congresses of each city and county. The people's representatives conferences of all circles in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces should be convened this year. The people's representatives conference of all circles in the Northwest Administrative Region is prepared to be convened in 1951. When the people's representatives conferences of all circles are held, the democratic style should be fully promoted, criticism and self-criticism should be carried out, work should be thoroughly examined, discipline should be strengthened, so as to effectively oppose bureaucracy and improve work efficiency.

(6) In addition to primary schools, the five provinces of Northwest China currently have a total of nine universities and specialized schools with more than 5,000 students, and more than 280 secondary schools with more than 70,000 students. Before economic construction has been properly restored and developed, the existing foundations should be consolidated and reformed in 1950, and partial development should be carried out in areas where conditions permit. Governments at all levels should give sufficient attention to the education of workers, social education, and the education of ethnic minorities. In order to adapt to various necessary social reforms and construction undertakings, a large number of on-the-job cadres should be trained in rotation and technical cadres should be trained in a planned manner. In the People's Liberation Army, a cultural learning movement should be universally launched, with the army as the unit, and a quick-learning middle school with about 500 people should be established to improve the cultural level of commanders and fighters who have been tempered by combat for a long time, so that they have a preliminary foundation for learning various specialized knowledge and will become the backbone of various construction undertakings in the people's motherland in the future.

In terms of health work, we should actively prevent the occurrence of diseases and plagues, promote medical and health propaganda and education work, carry out necessary and possible health equipment, train medical cadres to serve the people, and pay attention to protecting the health of mothers, infants, and children. In various women's cadre training classes, knowledge and skills of maternal and child health must be learned. Health work should go deep into the broad masses, and social health work must be gradually established and improved.

In terms of literary and artistic work, we should inspire the people's political awareness, encourage the people's labor enthusiasm, develop new mass literature and art, transform old forms and content, cultivate and reward new literary and artistic workers, and help the development of literary and artistic work of various ethnic minorities, so that literary and artistic work can truly serve the broad masses of the people.

(7) Based on the principle of equality, unity, and mutual assistance, national regional autonomy shall be implemented in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities. In the people's representatives conferences and organs of political power of provinces, cities, and counties where various ethnic groups live together, each ethnic group shall have a considerable number of representatives. Disputes between ethnic groups shall be resolved through consultation among the people of all ethnic groups or through mediation by the government in accordance with the policies stipulated in the Common Program; oppose great Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism, and prohibit discrimination, oppression, and acts of splitting the unity of various ethnic groups. The Military and Political Committee and the provinces shall run cadre schools and cadre training classes for various ethnic minorities to train a large number of minority cadres. The economy of all ethnic groups must be developed, the living standards of the poor people must be improved, free trade and equal exchange must be implemented, marketing cooperatives must be organized, and necessary and possible social welfare undertakings must be carried out. All ethnic minorities have the freedom to develop their languages and writing, maintain or reform their customs and habits, and religious beliefs, so as to promote friendship and unity among all ethnic groups.

We believe that as long as we rely on the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, and with a cautious and humble attitude of learning, we will surely be able to unite, overcome difficulties, and do a good job in the affairs of the people of the Northwest.

    西北军政委员会主席彭德怀关于目前西北地区工作任务的报告
    ——西北军政委员会第一次会议通过
    西北五省业已全部解放，这是人民解放军西北人民和全国人民长期艰苦奋斗得到的光荣结果，也是伟大的英明的人民领袖毛泽东主席路线的胜利。今后西北五省即进入和平建设的新时期，全西北各民族人民应亲密地团结起来，巩固人民民主专政，为建设新西北而奋斗。兹根据人民政协共同纲领及西北情况，提出目前西北地区的工作任务如下：
    （一）西北地区人民解放战争已经胜利结束。我们新的任务，应是彻底消灭土匪，肃清特务，实行民主改革，动员一切力量，节衣缩食，克服困难，恢复和发展生产。在老解放区，即原来的陕甘宁边区，已经解决了土地问题，应用全力恢复和发展生产。在半老解放区，如黄龙分区，应继续发动群众，完成分配土地的工作。在新解放区，除了注意做好城市工作外，须用大力在乡村发动广大人民群众，进行民主改革。第一步进行消灭土匪，肃清特务，反对恶霸，进行减租，削弱封建势力；然后第二步，根据实际情况的发展和群众觉悟程度与组织程度，进行土地改革，消灭封建制度。
    （二）一九五零年秋收后至一九五一年春耕前，应在陕西大部地区，甘肃、宁夏两省部分地区，青海个别地区，进行土地改革，取得经验，普遍地教育干部与群众，准备于一九五一年秋收后至一九五二年春耕前，全部完成陕、甘、宁三省及基本上完成青海省的土地改革。在少数民族居住的地区和各民族杂居的地区暂不进行土地改革，何时进行，要看各民族人民的觉悟程度和当地实际情况发展而定。但在甘肃、宁夏、青海回族与汉族的农业区域内条件成熟时，亦可斟酌情形同时进行土地改革。在进行分配土地以前，地主富农所有的土地仍归地主富农所有；农民租种地主富农的土地，依照政府颁布的减租条例，按原有地租减少百分之二十五至百分之三十，进行减租和交租。在分配土地时，中农土地完全不动，没收地主和征收富农多余的土地、耕畜、农具以及和土地相连的乡村房屋，分配给无地或少地的农民。不得有追逼底财和实行扫地出门办法等行为。对地主富农兼营的工商业，应加以保护，不得以任何借口没收或损害。地主亦须分得与农民同样数量与质量的土地。在执行上述工作中，必须召开各界人民代表会议和农民代表会议，宣布政府的政策法令，教育人民群众，严格遵照政府的政策法令办事，使农村土地改革工作能够在农民群众觉悟的基础上热烈地有秩序地进行。处理罪犯时，一律按照法律手续，即由人民司法机关，或由上级政府指定专人组织临时人民法庭，依法裁判。如判处死刑时，必须经过省以上人民政府批准。坚决废止刑讯及其他侮辱犯人的行为。为了准备分配土地工作，必须有计划地十分认真地培养和训练干部，必须发动与组织好农民群众和开好区乡农民代表会议，有系统地介绍老解放区土地改革经验教训，重新翻印与反复讨论“怎样分析阶级”。此项区乡农民代表会议，由各村所有劳动人民和革命知识分子开群众大会推选代表组织成立，代行区乡人民代表大会职权，为乡村土地改革的合法执行机关。区乡一切应兴应革的重大工作与合理负担等，均应经过农民代表会议讨论，各区乡行政人员如有不法行为，经批评教育不改者，农民代表会有权呈报上级人民政府撤换之，以确立乡村人民民主政权的基础。
    （三）在一定时期内，西北地区的经济建设，应以农业和牧畜业为主。在农业方面，必须提高农民生产热情，改良种子和农作法，恢复和发展水利，并注意森林和草原的保护与培植，防治灾害，以达到中央人民政府给我们一九五○年的任务：增产粗粮三亿三千万斤，增产皮棉十二万担。甘、宁、青、新等省牧畜生产不应低于一九四九年的水平。为此，必须注意培养兽医干部，在牧畜区应有重点地设置兽医站和巡回防疫队等，并积极进行改良畜种。
    在工业和交通事业方面，必须修建天兰铁路，整修天宝段铁路，及修复被敌破坏之主要公路，注重玉门油厂及恢复乌兰油厂的生产，尽可能地开发享堂油矿，增加动力，发展棉毛纺织、皮革工业，并加强生产中的计划性和组织性，提高产量、质量，爱护机器，节省原料，以便减低成本，推广销路。改进这些工作，必须首先依靠提高工人阶级的政治觉悟，团结技术人员，共同努力，才能逐步实现。对有益于人民的私营企业，应予保护，并促进其发展。在金融贸易方面，促进物资交流，力争平稳物价，一切措施均须为恢复与发展生产而服务。在克服财政困难方面，必须完成中央人民政府所规定的各项税收任务，努力推销公债；严格建立各项财政收支制度，整编机构，核实人数，停止一切不必要的开支，保持艰苦奋斗的作风，开展全面的大生产运动，机关学校人员亦应实行业余生产；厉行节约，严禁贪污，反对铺张浪费。这些就是克服战后财政经济困难的有效办法，西北财政经济委员会应有具体计划加以逐步实现。同时必须切实注意救灾工作。由于去年天灾歉收，战争破坏，国民党匪军抢劫，人民负担一时未能减轻，致使春荒严重地存在着，个别地区已发生冬荒。各级政府必须立即发动与组织人民生产自救、互助互济，提倡农村公平自由借贷，保证有借有还。组织运销生产合作事业，奖励土产出口，换取粮食及日用必需品，在缺粮地区应禁止酿酒制糖。号召军政全体工作人员，每天节省一两粮食，救济春荒，并应采用一切有效办法，做到不要饿死一个人。
    （四）人民解放军在长期奋斗中，除消灭敌人外，并进行地方工作，建设革命根据地，积极生产，减轻人民负担，克服战争中的财政经济困难，这是人民解放军特具的优良传统。现在西北五省已全部解放，他们正在进行冬季整训、剿匪和做地方工作，并积极准备生产。按各地不同条件，准备垦荒，兴修水利，建筑铁路公路等，禁止从事商业，对于生产的结果，遵照毛主席关于军队参加生产建设工作的指示，实行公私兼顾，生产红利百分之四十归生产者个人所有，其余归该生产单位及国家所有。驻新疆的部队有十余万人参加生产，准备开荒六十万亩，每亩产粮以五斗计，可获粮三十万石；种棉五万亩，每亩产棉以二十斤计，可获棉花一百万斤。陕、甘、宁、青各省驻军估计将有四十万人以上参加生产。这一支生产大军，有高度的政治觉悟，有过去的生产经验，相信他们一定像完成战斗任务一样地坚决勇敢胜利地完成生产任务。在这一大生产运动中将会出现许多劳动英雄，在生产中起带头作用，他们也和战斗英雄一样的光荣。
    （五）一九五○年，必须依照中央人民政府颁布的各界人民代表会议组织通则，开好各省、市、县各界人民代表会议。各级人民代表会议是动员和团结各民主阶级、各民主党派和各民族人民的最好组织形式。经过代表会议，把政策传播到广大人民中去，使人民政府与人民群众密切连系起来，提高人民的政治觉悟，以利各项工作任务的完成，使人民民主专政和人民民主统一战线，从组织上更加巩固和完备起来。各市、县各界人民代表会议，应逐步代行市、县人民代表大会职权。陕、甘、宁、青、新五省各界人民代表会议，应在本年召开。西北大行政区的各界人民代表会议，准备在一九五一年召开。当各界人民代表会开会时，应充分发扬民主作风，开展批评与自我批评，深入检查工作，加强纪律，以求达到有效地反对官僚主义，提高工作效率。
    （六）西北五省除小学外，现有大学、专科学校共九个，学生五千多人，中等学校约二百八十多个，学生七万余人。在经济建设尚未得到适当的恢复和发展以前，一九五○年应在原有基础上进行整顿和改革，在有条件的地区得部分发展。各级政府对工人教育、社会教育及少数民族的教育工作，均应予以足够的重视。为适应各种必须的社会改革和建设事业，应有计划地轮流训练大量的在职干部和培养技术干部。人民解放军中，应普遍展开文化学习运动，以军为单位，设立五百人左右的速成中学，以提高久经战斗锻炼的指战员文化水平，使之有学习各项专门知识的初步基础，将来成为人民祖国各项建设事业中的骨干。
    在卫生工作方面，应积极地预防疾病瘟疫的产生，推广医药卫生宣传教育工作，进行必要与可能的卫生设备，培养为人民服务的医务干部，注意保护母亲、婴儿、儿童的健康。在各种妇女干部训练班中，必须学习妇婴卫生的知识与技能。卫生工作应深入到广大群众中去，必须逐步建立和健全社会卫生工作。
    在文艺工作方面，应启发人民的政治觉悟，鼓励人民的劳动热情，发展新的大众文艺，改造旧的形式和内容，培养和奖励新的文艺工作者，并帮助各少数民族文艺工作的开展，使文艺工作真正能为广大人民服务。
    （七）本平等团结互助原则，在各少数民族聚居的地区，实行民族区域自治。各民族杂居地区之省、市、县各界人民代表会议和政权机关内，各民族均应有其相当名额的代表。各民族间的纠纷，应本共同纲领中所规定的政策，经过各民族人民协商或由政府调处解决之；反对大民族主义和狭隘民族主义，禁止民族间的歧视、压迫和分裂各民族团结的行为。军政委员会和各省应举办各少数民族的干部学校和干部训练班，培养大批的少数民族干部。必须发展各民族的经济，改善贫苦人民生活，实行贸易自由，等价交换，组织运销合作社，举办必要与可能的社会福利事业。各少数民族均有发展其语言文字、保持或改革其风俗习惯及宗教信仰的自由，以促进各民族间的友爱团结。
    我们相信，只要依据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，在中央人民政府领导下，以谨慎虚心学习的态度，我们一定能团结，一定能克服困难，一定能办好西北人民的事情。【新华社西安二十九日电】
