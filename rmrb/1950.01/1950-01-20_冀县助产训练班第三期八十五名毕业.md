    [This Newspaper's News] The third session of the midwifery training class, sponsored by the Jixian People's Government of Hebei Province, has concluded. The majority of the trainees in this session were old-style birth attendants, totaling eighty-five people, and the course lasted seven days. There were two instructors, specially hired for their expertise in obstetrics. The course content covered prenatal and postnatal hygiene, as well as issues related to the health of pregnant women and infants. The teaching method involved lectures by instructors followed by group discussions and exchanges of birth attendant experiences among the trainees. After the training, the trainees generally recognized the shortcomings of the old methods of midwifery and learned scientific midwifery techniques. Upon completion of the course and successful examination, learning certificates have been issued, authorizing them to perform midwifery work. (Wang Binqing, Wanxiao, First District, Jixian)
