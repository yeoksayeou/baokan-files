The Vocabulary of Poetry
Zang Kejia

Recently, I read several articles discussing vocabulary, which were prompted by Mr. Jiang Hua's article entitled "Efforts Must Be Made to Expel Confusing Vocabulary" published in the seventh issue of the "Literary Gazette." He started by dissecting lines of poetry, so I will write down some of my thoughts on this issue within the scope of poetry.

The issue of diction in poetry—that is, the language of poetry—can be said to be a very old one. Its emergence almost coincided with the emergence of poetry itself. The origin of poetry is song, and song is a product of the people, spread and broadcast through oral singing. Therefore, its creators—the laboring masses—endowed it with life using their daily language. When folk songs developed into poetry, that is, when the ruling class literati plagiarized it, plundered it, and turned it into a tool for expressing their feelings, it not only changed in content but also, as if symbolizing class opposition, the written language became contradictory. Folk songs produced using spoken language and poems sculpted with written language went their separate ways. This division is very common, but because of the disparity between language and writing, coupled with other conditions, this division is particularly serious and acute in China.

Poetry, like all other artistic fields, develops forward along its own path based on many conditions. However, because it is divorced from the actual life of the masses of the people, its content gradually withers, often leaving only a pathetic shell. Only when it expresses the suffering and aspirations of the broad masses of the people, and its form and language are close to them, is its life vigorous and its value noble. The works of Du Fu and Bai Juyi are examples.

Poetry, held in the hands of a few high-ranking people, increasingly becomes a manipulation of words and phrases. Thus, in the West, there was the so-called concept of "poetic words," and in China, people painstakingly studied and refined, emphasizing "elegance." Even in the twentieth century, those writing old-style poetry still used "sails" to replace ships and "leaks" to represent clocks. In short, they ennobled and poeticized the words and phrases of poetry to the point of petrification. When mighty figures stood up and wrote poetry in a completely new way with the trend of the times, they were often criticized. Whitman and Mayakovsky encountered this kind of criticism.

New poetry and old poetry are, of course, different. However, from the very beginning, new poetry, like its authors, its mission, its target audience, and other issues, did not raise a clear banner indicating the direction of effort. The "newness" of "new poetry" compared to old poetry lies in the fact that it used "vernacular that is neither completely classical nor completely colloquial" and "Mandarin" to express the thoughts and feelings of "intellectuals who are neither completely new nor completely old." Although new poetry overthrew old poetry, old poetry left behind its residual words and phrases as a souvenir. Later, the forms of foreign poetry were also brought in, creating a great influence. Thus, new poetry, this infant that had only just been born, babbled words mixed with the old, musty "setting sun" and "withered willows" from old poetry; and some vocabulary and syntax from English, French, American…!

The War of Resistance Against Japan was a turning point. Before that, due to the severity of the national crisis and the corruption of the reactionary government, poets began to pay attention to this great reality, using poetry to curse the darkness and resist oppression. However, the vocabulary they used to express it was not understandable to the masses, and the poets themselves did not clearly realize this. When the War of Resistance began, the poets' world expanded, the issue of the connection between poetry and the masses arose, and the poetry recitation movement unfolded. The form and vocabulary of poetry also took a step forward with reality. There was good reason for the significant impact of Ai Qing's "Torch" and "He Died in the Second," and Tian Jian's "To the Fighters" and "He Also Wants to Be Human." However, this step was not too big. The poet did not step from the petty-bourgeois to the proletarian standpoint. Poetry also did not break through the circle of intellectuals and expand to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Although the vocabulary of poetry was relatively fresh and lively, and relatively easy to pronounce, it was still mostly intellectual, bookish, and not easily understood or appreciated by the common people. It was not until the 1942 "Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" that the fate and future of poetry were decided. Only then did poets consciously go deep into life, temper themselves through struggle, transform themselves, and consciously learn from folk songs, write wall posters, and learn to refine their own lines of poetry from the spoken language of the people. By reading how Li Ji wrote about his "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang's" self confession, we can know how its success and influence came about. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas of that time, we also produced "mountain songs" and some dialect poems. This was a big deal. It takes creative courage for a poet to abandon his accustomed forms, vocabulary, and syntax and re-establish a folk song style. Even today, most friends who write poetry have not completely expelled some intellectual, stale, poetic vocabulary from their poems. The today I am talking about is the today when farmers have their own new folk songs; when liberation soldiers have their own gun barrel poems; when workers have their own clappers; the today I am talking about is also the today when the masses demand that poets sing for them in words they can understand; the today when writing and language, poetry and song, are closely linked step by step.

In such a situation, many poems still retain many such vocabularies as pointed out by Mr. Jiang Hua and many that have not been pointed out one by one. This shows how stubborn outdated things are, like rotten shells attached to the stones on the beach becoming fossils. It is not that poets deliberately want them, but that they slip in unintentionally. The well-trodden path is taken with a single step, and the accustomed vocabulary comes without beckoning. Sometimes, even if you try your best to avoid it, you often cannot avoid it. The vocabulary in your heart is like chips, drawn and drawn, and there are only a few of these roots.

We cannot regard the vocabulary issue as merely a technical issue to be resolved. This is an issue of how to unify written language and spoken language, an issue of how poetry should connect with the broad masses, and an issue of the transformation of the poet's own thoughts and feelings. Just like the ossified vocabulary remaining in our poems, we also have residues of petty-bourgeois thoughts and feelings in our bodies. If our feelings about things, our way of thinking, are petty-bourgeois, then the vocabulary expressing these feelings and thoughts cannot be popular and proletarian. Different classes have different thoughts and feelings, and the language and vocabulary that express these thoughts and feelings will not be the same. In class society, people have class nature, and so does language. To get rid of the entanglement of these old sentences and old vocabulary, one must first get rid of the remnants of those old feelings and old thoughts. If the poet stands on the original foothold and uses the art of drawing talismans to exorcise these "confusing vocabulary," it is useless no matter how "hard" you try. For an intellectual poet, the process of language learning is also the process of self-transformation and class transformation. If not, even if you record thousands of sentences of the people's spoken language and replace the old vocabulary with them in your poems, it is only like grafting branches cut from a living tree onto a withered trunk. The sentences and vocabulary in poetry are made alive by the poet's emotions. If thoughts and feelings have not reached a new, strong, and mass level, then his vocabulary can never be fresh, powerful, and infectious.

For half a year, because I spent all day looking at manuscripts, I had the opportunity to read a large number of poems. Every time a great event arrives, many poems of praise are produced. This is very good and very exciting. But after reading too many, one naturally has a feeling: many poems are not only similar in meaning, but also have a lot of identical vocabulary. The great new era has inspired and produced a large number of poets. With the large-scale production of poems by poets, it is easy to give people a feeling of "flooding." In terms of content, because the feelings and thoughts are not profound and specific enough, it is inevitable that they appear hot and empty. Because they are all revolutionary intellectuals, the emotional responses to the same events are not very different, so in the expression, they also use many similar sentences and vocabularies.

When we take the clappers, drum lyrics, or jingles written or sung by workers, peasants, and soldiers about the same event, the situation is different. They write or sing their joy and encouragement based on their personal, concrete, and flesh-and-blood feelings. Their syntax and vocabulary are national and consistent with spoken language. Of course, their works do not yet have high artistic value, their language and vocabulary are still quite rough and simple, and there are also many repetitions. However, this vocabulary is alive, it is picked from the living branches and fresh leaves of the tree of life, and even if there are some repetitions, they are different from the mutual repetitions of intellectual poets.

In the final analysis, the issue of poetic vocabulary is the issue of the poet's feeling and expression. The acquisition of new vocabulary—popular, spoken—must be based on the ideological transformation of intellectuals. Simply trying to solve the vocabulary problem from the vocabulary itself, I think, is either impossible or incomplete.

### 诗的词汇

    诗的词汇
    臧克家
    最近读了好几篇关于词汇的讨论文章，这是由于江华先生发表在《文艺报》七期上题名为《要努力驱逐使人糊涂的词汇》一文引起的。他从剖解诗句开始，我就在诗的范围内写下一点我对于这个问题的感想。
    关于诗的遣辞用字问题——也就是诗的语言问题，可以说是一个很古老的问题了。它的产生，几乎可以说与诗的产生是同时的。诗的原始是歌，歌是民间产物，借着口头歌唱流传，广播，所以它的创造者——劳苦大众，是用了自己的日常语言赋予它以生命的。等到民歌发展成诗，也就是说，统治阶级的文人把它剽窃过来，掠夺过来，成为自己玩物抒情的工具以后，它不但在内容上变了质，在形式上，在词汇语言上，好似象征着阶级对立一样，文字语言也就矛盾了起来。用口语产生的民歌，和用文字雕琢成的诗，就各走起各的路来。这种分裂的情形是很普遍的，但是因为语言文字的悬殊再加上其他的条件，这分裂，在中国也就表现得特别严重和尖锐。
    诗，同一切别的文艺部门一样，它是依据于许多条件沿着自己的道路向前发展的。但是，因为它脱离开人民大众的实际生活，内容方面就日渐枯萎起来，结果，往往是徒然剩下了一副可怜的皮囊。只有当它表现广大人民的痛苦和愿望，形式语句接近他们的时候，它的生命才是旺盛的，它的价值才是高贵的，杜甫，白居易的作品就是例子。
    诗，握在少数高高在上的人们的手里，越来越变成词句的玩弄，于是，在西洋有过所谓“诗字”的说法，在中国也一味考究推敲，讲求“典雅”，已经是二十世纪了，作旧诗的人们，还用“风帆”去代替轮船，用“漏”去代表钟表。总之，把诗的词句高贵化，诗化，一至于僵化而后甘心。当大力者站起来随着时代潮流把诗写得崭新的时候，往往受到非难，惠特曼和玛雅可夫斯基就遭遇过这种非难。
    新诗和旧诗当然不同。可是，一开始，新诗对于语言的问题就像它对于它的作者、它的使命、它的读者对象等等问题一样，并没有打出一面鲜明的旗子指示着努力的方向。“新诗”比旧诗“新”的地方，就在于它用了“半文不白”，和“蓝青官话”的“白话”抒发了“半新不旧”的“知识分子”的思想情感。新诗虽说打倒了旧诗，但旧诗却把自己的残语剩句留下来做了个纪念。后来，外国诗的形式又被搬运过来，造成很大的影响，于是，新诗，这个诞生不久的婴儿，他口中的喁喁竟夹杂着旧诗里旧得发臭了的“残阳”，“衰柳”；英国的、法国的、美国的、……一些语汇和句法！
    抗战是一个关口。在以前，由于国难的严重，反动政府的腐败，诗人们开始注视了这伟大的现实，用诗歌去诅咒黑暗，反抗压迫，可是，他们所用以表现的词汇并不能够使大众懂，在写诗的人自己也并没有明确的意识到这一点。抗战开始了，诗人们的生活天地扩大了，诗歌和群众联系的问题发生了，诗歌朗诵运动展开了。诗的形式和词汇也跟着现实向前跨了一步。艾青的“火把”，“他死在第二次”，田间的“给战斗者”，“他也要做人”等所以能够发生很大的影响，不是没有理由的。但是这一步跨的并不太大，诗人并没有从小资产阶级一步跨到无产阶级立场上去。诗也没有一下子冲破知识分子的圈子，扩大到工农兵群众中去。诗的语汇虽然是比较新鲜活泼了，比较可以上口了，但它还多半是知识分子气的，书本子气的，老百姓听不大懂也不大有兴趣去听的。一直到了一九四二年“延安文艺座谈会”这才决定了诗的命运和前途。诗人这才自觉的去深入生活，用战斗去锻炼自己，改造自己，这才自觉的去学习民歌，去写墙头诗，去从民众的口语里学著提炼自己的诗句。我们读了李季怎么写“王贵与李香香”的自白，就可以知道他的成功和影响是怎么造成的。在当日的国统区，我们也产生了“山歌”和一些方言诗。这是一件大事情。一个诗人抛弃他用惯的形式、词汇、句法，重新建立一个民歌体，这是需要创造上的勇气的。多数写诗的朋友，就是直到今天，也还没有把一些知识分子的、陈腐的、诗的词汇从自己的诗篇里完全被逐出去。我说的这个今天，就是农民们有了自己新的民歌；解放战士们有了自己的枪杆诗；工人们有了自己快板的今天；我说的今天，也就是群众要求诗人们用他们听得懂的诗句为他们歌唱的今天；也就是文字和语言，诗和歌一步步扣紧了的今天。
    在这样一个情势之下，许多诗篇里，尚遗留着如江华先生所指出以及未能一一指出的许多这样的语汇。这表示着，过时的东西是怎样顽强，如同腐败的贝壳附着在海滨的石子上成为化石一样。这并不是诗人们有意要它，而是它在无意中溜进来的。走熟了的路子，一举步就是，用惯的词汇，不招手它也来。有时，就是自己竭力想避免，也往往避不开，免不掉，心里的词汇像筹码一样，抽来抽去就是有数的这些根。
    语汇问题，我们不能把它仅只当做一个技巧问题来看，来求得解决。这是一个文字语言如何统一的问题，这是诗歌如何去联系广大群众的问题，这也是诗人本身思想感情的改造问题。如同残留在我们诗篇里的僵化语汇一类，我们身上也同样残留着小资产阶级的思想和感觉。如果我们对事物的感觉，我们的思想方法是小资产阶级性的，那么，表现这感觉、思想的语汇就不可能是大众化的，无产阶级的。阶级不同，思想感觉也就不同，作为这些表现的语言、词汇也就不会一样。在阶级的社会里，人是有阶级性的，语言也是如此。想摆脱掉这些旧语句，旧词汇的牵连，就得首先摆脱掉那些旧感觉、旧思想的残余。如果诗人站在原来的立脚点上，以画符驱鬼的方术去驱逐这些“使人糊涂的词汇”，再“努力”也是白打的。对于一个知识分子的诗人，语言学习的过程也就是自我改造、阶级转化的过程。不是这样的话，你就是把人民的口语记录下千万句，代替了旧的语汇用在你的诗篇里，也不过是把从活生生的大树上折下来的枝条接在一棵枯干上而已。诗里的语句、词汇是诗人的感情使它们活起来的。思想感情还没有达到崭新、强烈、群众化的程度，那么他的词汇也就决不可能是新鲜的、有力的、富于感染性的。
    半年来，因为终天看稿子，也就有机缘读了大量的诗。每一个伟大事件一到，就有许许多多歌颂的诗歌产生出来。这是很好的，很令人兴奋的。但是一读多了，就自然会发生一个感觉：有许多诗，不但意思差不多，就是词汇也有不少是雷同的。伟大的新时代激发了、产生了大批诗人，在诗人们大量生产之下，诗篇就容易给人一个“泛澜”的感觉。在内容上讲，由于感受、思索得不够深刻、具体，所以难免显得热烘烘的、空洞洞的。因为同样是革命的知识分子，对于同样事件也就发生了相差不远的情感上的反应，所以在表现上，也就采用了很多差不离的语句和词汇。
    我们拿工农兵写的或唱出来的关于同样事件的快板、鼓词、或是顺口溜，情形就两样了。他们是凭了切身的、具体的、血肉关联的感觉写出或唱出了他们的欢欣和鼓舞。他们的句法、词汇，是民族的，是和口语一致的。当然，他们的作品并不是已经具有多么高的艺术价值，他们的语言、词汇还是相当粗糙、简单，也有许多雷同。但是，这种词汇却是活的，是从生命树上活枝鲜叶摘下来的，就是有的雷同，也和知识分子诗人们的彼此雷同是不同的。
    归根结蒂说起来，诗的词汇问题就是诗人感觉、表现的问题。新词汇——大众的，口语的——的获得，必须以知识分子的思想改造为前提。单单从词汇本身想解决词汇的问题，我以为，那不是不可能就是不彻底的。
