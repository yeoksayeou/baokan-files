    People from All Circles in Beijing and Tianjin Celebrate the New Year
    Launch Movements to Comfort Military Families and Promote Public Bonds
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] People from all circles in Beijing and Tianjin celebrated the victorious New Year with extremely joyful hearts, and launched movements to comfort military families and promote public bonds. All institutions, factories, schools, shops, etc. in the capital were decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, and filled with joyful songs. The gate of the Central People's Government – Xinhua Gate – was hung with a large red lantern with the words "Long Live the People's Victory"; eight large red lanterns were hung on the Tiananmen Gate Tower, illuminating the large color portrait of Chairman Mao below, with eight red flags fluttering in the wind on both sides. The New Year's Grand Joint Celebration, organized by the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Education Bureau, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Student Federation, and more than 20 other institutions and organizations, was held simultaneously in Zhongshan Park and Beihai Park on the 2nd. There were programs such as the "Meritorious Service Competition for Searching out Reactionaries" and ice sports events. Departments of the Ministry of Railways, the Beijing Municipal Postal Administration, the North China Construction Company, and the 70th Ordnance Factory held separate celebration meetings and symposiums to summarize the work achievements of 1949, report on the work guidelines for 1950, and call on employees to subscribe to the Victory Public Bonds. More than a thousand cadres and workers from more than ten institutions, including the News Administration, the Xinhua News Agency, and the capital's newspapers, also held a joint New Year's Eve party on New Year's Day afternoon. At that time, Director Hu of the News Administration attended and delivered a New Year's greeting, encouraging all news workers to study hard, work actively, overcome economic difficulties, and complete the tasks of 1950. The North China Agricultural Machinery General Branch Factories held a year-round achievement exhibition and a celebration meeting. All primary and secondary schools in the city held separate New Year's Eve parties and launched publicity or deliberated and purchased public bonds. The Peking University Student Union called on students to strengthen their studies at the New Year's Eve party. Jiaotong University and five schools, including Mengzang, Xiehua, No. 8 Middle School, and No. 53 Middle School, held a joint celebration and passed a New Year's greeting letter to Chairman Mao. Mass rallies were generally held in various districts to comfort the families of martyrs and revolutionary soldiers and to extend condolences.
    In the suburbs, after some land reform villages successfully completed land reform, the peasants were even more overjoyed. While celebrating the New Year, they also celebrated their liberation. The Nanjiao Public Security Team of Nanyuan Town in the Fourteenth District and the local farmers jointly dispatched Yangko and stilt walkers to perform publicity in the market and on the streets of the town. An old farmer named Guo Zhenxing, who was sixty-two years old, said: "Although last year and this year can be said to be a short year, they have indeed turned into two worlds. Last year, today, Wang Fenggang's bandit team lived in our Huaifang Village, looting and forcing each household to give rice and white flour. Poor people had little to eat and wear, and in the strong northwesterly wind, the puppet village chief forced the poor to cut trees and build fortifications for the bandits. This year, the land reform in our village has been completed, the landlords and village chiefs have been overthrown, and I have been divided eight mu and six fen of dry land, four mu of irrigated land, and three families have been divided a waterwheel. I am really happy. Whenever I am free, I pick up manure, and I always have a manure basket when I go out. I have already saved four large carts, and I must work hard to grow crops this year to give our government a good name and earn some respect." While celebrating the New Year and celebrating their liberation, the peasants in the suburbs shouted the slogans "Don't forget the People's Liberation Army when enjoying happiness" and "Thank Chairman Mao for our liberation."
    All institutions, factories, schools, and groups in Tianjin held entertainment evenings and heart-to-heart talks on New Year's Eve to discuss the great task of economic construction in 1950. At the joint New Year's Eve party of the employees of the No. 1 and No. 2 branches of the Rubber Factory of the Municipal Enterprise Company, the employees proposed to launch a large-scale production movement to greet 1950. A public bond solicitation campaign was launched at the New Year's Eve party at Nankai University. The Tianjin Workers' Cultural Club opened on New Year's Day; about 30,000 people visited it. The Public Security Bureau, the Central Military Music Academy, a certain tank regiment of the People's Liberation Army, and many factories and colleges dispatched Yangko teams and propaganda trucks to perform in the streets.
