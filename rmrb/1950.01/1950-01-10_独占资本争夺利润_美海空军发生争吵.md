    Monopoly Capital Struggles for Profits
    US Navy and Air Force Quarrel
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th. American Secretary of Defense Johnson, for the benefit of the Vought Aircraft Company he represents, secretly ordered a reduction of more than $350 million in the Navy's budget to expand the B-36 bomber program. This prompted attacks on Johnson by Representative Vinson, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and the Department of the Navy, and turned into a month-long dispute between the Air Force and the Navy. But in the end, it ended with a compromise between the aircraft and shipbuilding industrial monopolists.
    According to a commentary by Ye Yezhiefu, an observer of the Red Navy newspaper quoted by TASS: This struggle reflects the conflict of interest between the American shipbuilding monopoly industry and the aircraft monopoly industry. Representatives of the Navy and Air Force both demanded to occupy a leading position in the American aggression plan, but fundamentally this is a struggle among monopoly capitalists over who should obtain the majority of profits in the manufacture of military equipment. Johnson failed to fully realize his plan. This is largely due to the bankruptcy of the entire "air atomic war strategic concept," which is due to the loss of the American atomic monopoly.
    A compromise has been reached between the shipbuilding and aircraft monopoly industries. After former Mediterranean Fleet Commander Admiral Sherman succeeded Admiral Denfield as Chief of Naval Operations, he issued a statement saying: Currently, approximately $300 million is being used to manufacture new warships, with emphasis on building aircraft carriers that represent the fleet's attack power. This is proof of the compromise. Yemasyev pointed out: It is very obvious that no matter what differences exist between several large monopoly enterprises, they ultimately represent the same aggressive plan of American imperialism.

    独占资本争夺利润
    美海空军发生争吵
    【新华社北京九日电】美国国防部长詹逊为他所代表的沃尔梯飞机公司的利益，曾密令削减海军预算三亿五千余万美元，以扩充Ｂ三六型轰炸机，此事引起了众院军事委员会主席文森及海军部对詹逊的攻击，并变成空军与海军间持续一月的争论。但最后仍以飞机与造船工业垄断资本家的妥协而告结束。
    据塔斯社引红海军报观察家耶易谢夫的评论称：这一斗争反映出美国造船独占工业与飞机独占工业间的利益冲突。海军与空军的代表们都要求在美国的侵略计划中占领导地位，但基本上这是垄断资本家之间在制造军备上究竟谁应获得绝大部分利润的一场斗争。詹逊并未能充分地实现他的计划。这大半是由于整个“空中原子战争战略概念”的破产而这个战略概念的破产，又是由于美国丧失了原子独占。
    造船与飞机独占工业间已获得了妥协。前地中海舰队司令，薛尔曼海军上将在继邓菲尔德海军上将任海军参谋长之职后，发表声明称：在目前，约有三亿美元用在制造新军舰方面，并着重于制造代表舰队的攻击力量的航空母舰。这就是妥协的证明。耶马谢夫指出：甚为明显，不论若干大独占企业间有何种歧见，他们终究都表现美国帝国主义的同一的侵略计划。
