Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th. The asset inventory work of state-owned enterprises in Northeast China, which has lasted for more than eight months, is about to be completed. This work is an essential and important step for enterprises to implement economic accounting, and for the state to achieve unified management of assets and planned use of funds. State-owned enterprises in Northeast China account for a large proportion of the entire industrial economic system, but most of them suffered severe damage from the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang and urgently needed to be restored after the liberation of the entire region to facilitate production. Therefore, this heavy task of asset inventory was carried out in conjunction with the task of restoring production. In March last year, the Northeast People's Government issued an order for asset inventory, stipulating that all properties of state-owned enterprises, whether fixed assets such as machines, tools, and houses, or current assets such as finished products, semi-finished products, raw materials, equipment, cash, inventory, claims, and debts, whether received as spoils of war or purchased by themselves, must be accurately inventoried, registered, and valued. Profits and losses should be accurately calculated and submitted to the Northeast Finance and Economics Committee for examination and approval, and then handed over to the General Accounting Bureau to be recorded as state revenue. Then, according to needs, the General Accounting Bureau would allocate the funds to the relevant enterprises for collection as state investment, thereby establishing unified state management of the funds, profits and losses, and depreciation expenses of each enterprise. Subsequently, units such as the Industrial Department, Agricultural Department, Commerce Department, Finance Department, Transportation Department, Northeast Bank, Materials Department, and Railway Bureau of the Northeast People's Government first began the inventory. By August, the enterprises of the Military Industry Department, Military Supplies Department, and Health Department of the Northeast Military Region also carried out this work successively.

During the inventory process, although the progress of each enterprise varied due to different specific conditions, they generally went through three stages: "mobilization and deployment," "inventory, registration, and valuation," and "review and summary" (i.e., summarizing similar assets). In the mobilization and deployment stage, the main work of each enterprise was to carry out ideological and organizational preparation, hold meetings to mobilize cadres, workers, and technicians to recognize the importance of asset inventory, organize asset inventory committees at all levels according to the enterprise system, and formulate specific measures suitable for their respective enterprise departments. After the completion of the above preparation work, the second stage was entered, engaging in inventory, registration, finding valuation basis, estimating the current value of assets, and submitting them to the direct management organs of the respective enterprises. The third stage was to conduct thorough investigations, research, and conduct review reports at each level. In each stage, the General Accounting Bureau of the Northeast Finance and Economics Committee also sent personnel to various enterprises to understand the situation, help exchange experiences, and solve difficult problems. As of the end of the year, except for the military industry, military supplies, and health units, which started later and still needed some time to complete, the inventory, registration, and summary work of the other departments had been largely completed.

The experiences gained by the leading organs of various enterprises in the asset inventory work are:

Three main experiences:
    I. The inventory work should be rapid and meticulous
    II. Absorb advanced workers, technicians, and management personnel to participate
    III. Correctly estimate the value of assets

First, the inventory work should be carried out quickly and meticulously. Generally, it takes about three to five months from the beginning to the summary. As for the length of each stage, it depends on the progress of each stage. If the mobilization and deployment work is done well, time can be saved in the following two stages, and unnecessary confusion and rework can be avoided.

Second, the asset inventory committees at all levels should absorb some advanced workers, technicians, and management personnel to participate, so as to give play to their strength and enable the inventory work to be carried out smoothly and effectively. On the contrary, simply using administrative power or relying solely on inventory personnel to carry out the inventory will not achieve great results.

Third, correctly estimate the value of various assets. This is the most important and most difficult part of the inventory work. Due to the different valuation basis materials of various departments, and the fact that industrial asset prices are different from the ratios and indexes of gold, silver, grain, and general commodity prices, it is not easy to make the valuation accurate. The solution to this problem by the General Accounting Bureau of the Northeast Finance and Economics Committee is to require the valuation to be close to accurate, and the inaccurate parts will be resolved by taking regular correction methods in the future, so as to avoid prolonging the time too long, affecting the determination of the overall asset value, and hindering the implementation of economic accounting by various enterprises and the state's mastery, regulation, and use of the entire assets. In the asset valuation, regarding the registration and valuation of real estate, it is determined that the real estate occupied by each enterprise shall be registered and valued by the respective enterprise in order to amortize depreciation. Real estate occupied by other agencies and units that belong to certain enterprises shall be registered and valued separately by the enterprise and the agency. In the above-mentioned real estate registration and valuation, the land shall not be valued for the time being, only the quantity shall be registered, because the grade of land value varies depending on the location of the land (such as commercial areas, industrial areas, residential areas in cities, and agricultural areas in rural areas) and its purpose of use, and it is temporarily difficult to specify. Regarding the registration of land, all units uniformly use square meters as the unit of calculation. The registration and valuation of other fixed assets is also a complex and heavy task. Because some assets do not have market prices, or the original account books, building plans, archives, etc. have been lost or damaged, making it impossible to verify them. The current remedy is that, in addition to not valuing underground buildings and mineral deposits, etc. that have no scientific basis and cannot be calculated for the time being, for those that still have material basis for estimation or have similar assets that can be compared, the method of referring to the experience of technicians, workers, and management personnel and jointly studying with them is adopted for pricing. Regarding the valuation of general assets, it is not easy to accurately compare and convert them according to gold, silver dollars, grain, cloth, etc., because the above-mentioned materials were subject to control during the war, and their past and present ratios to assets are quite different, while the general price index and the industrial equipment price index, although also different, are relatively close to correct. If calculated using a classified price index, it would be even more reasonable. Many business units have adopted this approach.

Finally, real estate, machinery, equipment, and other equipment that are owned by the enterprise but have not been used or are temporarily not needed must also be carefully inventoried, registered, and valued, and temporarily treated as the enterprise's assets, but should be listed separately in separate subjects and not depreciated, pending state allocation.

In the process of asset inventory, some deviations and shortcomings have occurred in various units. For example, some units, holding localist ideas, lowered the valuation; and some individual units even reported more and less, attempting to pay less depreciation and obtain more investment in the future after the assets are determined. The above-mentioned deviations have been criticized and corrected after being discovered by the higher authorities. Now the review work at each level of each enterprise has basically ended, and the Northeast Finance and Economics Committee is conducting the final review and intends to temporarily treat the inventoried property as the funds of the respective enterprises. In the near future, when determining the 1950 investment plan for each enterprise, the higher-level organs of each unit will finally determine the funds of each unit based on the results of the asset inventory and the changes in assets after the inventory. As for the units whose valuation is inaccurate in the process of asset inventory, the Finance and Economics Committee will order the competent authorities to correct them in future management and gradually make them accurate.

    实行经济核算制
    东北国营企业清理资产即将完成
    统一管理国家资产
    【新华社沈阳十六日电】为时八个多月的东北国营企业清理资产工作，即将完成。这一工作是企业实行经济核算，并使国家达到统一管理资产有计划地运用资金的必不可少的重要步骤。东北国营企业在整个工业经济体系中所占的比重甚大，但其大部分都曾遭受过日伪与国民党的严重破坏，全境解放后亟待恢复，以利生产。因此这一繁重的清理资产工作，是和恢复生产任务结合起来进行的。去年三月，东北人民政府发布了清理资产命令，规定国营各企业的一切财产，凡机器、器具、房屋等固定资产或成品、半成品、原料、器材、现金、存货、债权、债务等流动资产，无论是接收缴获的或自行购置的，均须精确清点，登记和估价：精确计算盈亏，呈报东北财政经济委员会审定后，统交总会计局作成国家收入，然后根据需要由总会计局拨付各该企业具领，作为国家投资，从而建立国家对各该企业的资金、盈亏和折旧费的统一管理。此后，东北人民政府所属工业部、农业部、商业部、财政部、交通部、东北银行、物资处及铁路总局等单位即首先开始清理。至八月间，东北军区所属军工、军需、卫生三部各企业，亦先后进行了这一工作。
    在清理过程中，各企业虽然由于具体条件不同而进度不一，但一般均经过了“动员布置”、“清点登记与估价”、“审核与汇总”（即将同类资产加以归纳）三个阶段。在动员布置阶段中，各企业主要的工作是进行思想上和组织上的准备，开会动员干部、工人与技术人员认识清理资产的重要性，按企业系统组织各级清理资产委员会等机构，及制定一些适合于本企业部门的具体办法。上述准备工作完成，即进入第二阶段，从事清点，登记，找出估价根据，估出资产现值，呈交各该企业的直接管理机关。第三阶段则是进行周密调查、研究并逐级进行审核汇报等工作。在各个阶段中，东北财政经济委员会总会计局更有重点地派员至各企业了解情况，帮助交流经验和解决困难问题。截至年底为止，除军工、军需、卫生各单位因开始较晚，完成尚需若干时日外，其余各部清理、登记、汇总工作均已大体完成。
    各企业领导机关在清点资产工作中获得的经验是：
    三点主要经验：
    一、清点工作要迅速细致
    二、吸收先进工人、技师、管理人员参加
    三、正确估计资产价值
    第一、进行清点工作要迅速而又细致，一般由开始到汇总约需三个月到五个月的时间，至于各个阶段长短，则看各阶段进行情形而定。如果动员布置工作做得好，在以后两阶段中即可节省时间，并能避免不必要的纷乱和翻工现象。
    第二、各级清理资产委员会，应吸收一部先进的工人、技师、管理人员参加，以发挥他们的力量，使清理工作能顺利而切实；反之单纯运用行政力量或单纯依靠清理人员进行清点，所获效果就不大。
    第三、正确估计各种资产的价值。这是清理工作中最紧要而又最困难的一环。由于各部门的估价根据材料不一，工业资产价格又与金银粮食和一般物价等比值和指数有所不同等原因，致使估价工作不易做得准确。东北财经委员会总会计局解决这个问题的办法是要求估价达到近乎精确，其不精确部分以后采取定期修正的办法来解决，以免过长拖延时间，影响整个资产价值的确定，妨害各企业经济核算的实施和国家对整个资产的掌握，调节和运用。资产估价中，关于房地产的登记、估价问题，确定各企业已占用的房地产，统由各该企业进行登记、估价，以便摊还折旧。其他机关单位占用的属于某些企业的房地产，则由该企业和该机关分别登记估价。上述房地产登记估价中，地产一律暂不估价，只登记数量，原因是由于土地所在地区不同（如城市中的商业区、工业区、居民区及乡下的农业区等）及其使用目的不同，土地价值的级数，暂时尚难于规定。关于土地的登记，各单位都统一以平方公尺为计算单位。其他固定资产的登记估价，也是一个复杂繁重工作。因为有些资产没有市价，或是因遗失损毁了原始账簿、建筑图案、档案等无法稽考。现在的补救办法是除了对没有科学根据又无法计算的地下建筑及矿藏等暂不估价外，对于尚有材料根据可以估计或有与之相类似的资产可以比较者，即采取根据技术人员、工人、管理人员的经验并与他们共同研究的方法进行作价。关于一般资产的估价，按黄金、银元、粮食、布匹等进行比价、换算，都不易做得准确，因为上述物资在战争时期曾实行管制，它们过去和现在与资产的比价悬殊颇大，而一般物价指数与工业器材物价指数虽然也有差异，却比较接近正确。假如以分类物价指数计算，则更近于合理。不少企业单位采取了这个办法。
    最后凡属本企业占有而尚未用或暂不需用的房地产与机器、器材及其他设备等亦需详细清点、登记与作价，暂时亦作该企业资产，但应以单独科目另列，不作折旧，以待国家调用。
    在清理资产过程中，各单位曾经发生若干偏向和缺点，如有些单位，抱着本位主义思想，降低估价；甚至有个别单位以多报少，企图在将来资产确定后，少缴折旧，多得投资。上述偏向经上级发现后已予批评纠正。现在各企业逐级的审核工作基本上已经结束，东北财政经济委员会正进行最后审查，并拟将所清理之财产，暂时作为各该企业的资金。在不久的将来确定各企业一九五零年的投资计划时，将由各单位之上一级机关，根据其已清理资产之结果和清理后之资产变动情况，再最后确定各该单位之资金。至于有的单位在清理资产过程中估价不确者，财政经济委员会将责成各该主管机关在今后管理中加以纠正，逐渐使其准确。
