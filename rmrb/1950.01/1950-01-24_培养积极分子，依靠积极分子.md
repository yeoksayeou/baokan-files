Cultivate Activists, Rely on Activists

Party member activists play a significant role in the life and activities of party organizations at all levels. They conduct political work among the masses daily and organize the masses to realize the resolutions of our Party. Comrade Stalin pointed out that if we are good at using activists, they can create the greatest force capable of creating miracles.

Relying on and using party member activists is the foundation for ensuring the smooth completion of various tasks.

Because our Party has conducted its work on the basis of inner-Party democracy and has enhanced the enthusiasm and initiative of all party members, it has cultivated a large number of activists and, with the help of these activists, has realized leadership in all sectors of Party affairs and economic work. Relying on party member activists – this is the foundation for the success of the work of any local Party organ.

In the struggle to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, every Party committee and every Party branch must solve enormous and arduous tasks. The practical work of our Party organs at all levels tells us that wherever tasks can be completed smoothly, the leaders there must be good at attracting party member activists to participate in the work, consulting with them on problems, and, with their participation, studying the work of Party organizations and economic organizations, and improving the inspection of the implementation of Party resolutions. If the party masses, and especially the party member activists, are absorbed to solve various problems of inner-Party work, mass political work, and economic work, and if the leaders can listen to their opinions and consider their experience, then these problems will be solved more quickly and correctly.

The best way to cultivate and use party member activists is to organize meetings of various party member activists to discuss work.

Having an inseparable connection with the party masses and educating and training party member activists in daily work – this is the strength of party organs at all levels and the guarantee of their successful work. For example, the Grigorovsky City Committee participates with party member activists – district committee workers, branch secretaries, propagandists, economic workers, experts, and production innovators – to solve various Party, government, and economic work problems. The city party committee often holds meetings of party member activists to discuss the current primary tasks of the urban party organization, and often consults with party members working in this or that economic sector or cultural sector, and holds joint meetings of branch secretaries and propagandists. The result of the city party committee's work with activists has enabled enterprises in one of the major central cities of the Donbass to ensure the victorious completion of state tasks.

The role of party member activists is great and important in further improving the ideological work of party organizations. In implementing the resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on ideological issues, Party organs at all levels began to more widely attract party member activists to discuss issues of political life, lead the political education of party members and mass political work among the working masses, and promote a large number of leading cadres of political schools and groups, as well as various lecturers and reporters, among party member activists. Party workers began to regularly give reports and lectures on important political issues.

Organizations that do not rely on party member activists weaken the Party's ties with the masses and embark on the path of bureaucratic and administrative leadership methods.

However, the work of cultivating party member activists is not receiving the attention it deserves everywhere. Some local Party leaders do not like to cultivate activists, nor do they rely on them, but prefer to work with a very small circle of people, saying: "Less trouble!" But such people have departed from the Bolshevik principles of collective leadership, weakened their ties with the masses, and embarked on the path of bureaucratic and administrative leadership methods.

Similar shortcomings were also exposed in the work practice of the Qiumaysky State Committee, which condoned errors in the leadership methods of Party organizations, Soviet organizations, and economic organizations, did not properly solve the problems raised by various places, did not delve into the needs of various districts, did not help them, and rarely listened to work reports from city committees and district committees. Inner-Party work and mass political work in the state's Party organization were neglected. The State Committee made mistakes in cadre work, did not use the spirit of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, and did not use the spirit of strict adherence to Party discipline and state discipline to educate party member activists and Soviet activists, which led to complacency and irresponsibility within the Party. Bureaucratic leadership methods dominated the practical work of the Qiumaysky State Committee, and the organic connection with lower-level Party organizations was almost non-existent.

Meetings of party member activists must be fully prepared to ensure that activists actively participate in discussions of Party tasks and ensure the bold development of criticism and self-criticism.

Regularly conducting meetings of party member activists is one of the most important conditions for correctly leading the work of party organizations. Comrade Stalin pointed out that it is necessary to convene meetings of "workers in all work sectors – economic workers, Party workers, trade union workers, military workers –" "so that the meetings can be conducted regularly, so that the meeting can raise the issues it deems necessary to raise, so that the relationships between cadres of various specialties are not disconnected, so that all workers feel themselves to be a member of a Party family fighting for an indivisible, common cause of all people – the cause of the proletariat."

Meetings of party member activists help mobilize the strength of Party organizations to solve current tasks, are a place for Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, and are a method of educating activists themselves. According to the Constitution of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), meetings of party member activists should be convened to discuss the most important resolutions of the Party and government in all union republics, districts, states, central regions, and in all large or small industrial centers. In large central regions, not only should meetings of urban party member activists be convened, but also meetings of district party member activists.

How are meetings of party member activists held? In many places, meetings are convened irregularly and without due preparation. For example, in Sverdlovsk City, activist meetings have been conducted in this way.

After deciding to hold a city activist meeting to discuss the tasks of Party organizations in preparing enterprises for the winter, the city committee did not seriously study the issue, nor did it seriously prepare specific opinions for discussion at the activist meeting. In his report, T. Krasnozhenov, the secretary of the city party committee, did not seriously and thoroughly analyze the process of winter preparation, nor did he propose tasks to the Party organization. The secretary of the city committee did not act like a Party leader, but rather like an economic administrative worker. The reporter made his mistake even more serious by criticizing more than one hundred Party workers, Soviet workers, and economic workers in the city, but he rarely talked about the tasks of political work related to winter preparation. Naturally, such a report was of no benefit to promoting a pragmatic discussion of issues and developing criticism and self-criticism. As a result, the activist meeting was conducted very poorly.

Meetings of party member activists – are a Bolshevik school for educating cadres and an effective method for mobilizing the masses to complete the resolutions of the Party and government. In order for meetings of party member activists to realize their role, then one should engage in their preparation in a comprehensive, solemn, and thoughtful manner. In preparing for and holding meetings of party member activists, it is necessary to truly ensure that activists actively participate in discussions of the tasks of Party organizations and ensure the bold development of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism.

The Party organization is carrying out the great and comprehensive task of completing communist construction. In the process of this work, our party member activists and party cadres, who are the treasures of the Party and the state, are improved, educated, and trained.

The most basic duty of the Party organization is to constantly cultivate activists, continuously help them improve their political and ideological level, and help them master the great and invincible weapon of the Leninist-Stalinist Party – Marxist-Leninist theory.

### 培养积极分子，依靠积极分子

    培养积极分子，依靠积极分子
    党员积极分子在各级党组织的生活和活动中起着巨大的作用。他们每天在群众中进行政治工作，并且组织群众去实现我党的决议。斯大林同志指出：如果善于使用积极分子，则他们就能够造成创造奇迹的最伟大的力量。
    依靠与使用党员积极分子，是保证顺利完成各项任务的基础。
    我们党由于在党内民主的基础上，进行了自己的工作，提高了全体党员的积极性和自动性，于是就培养了大批的积极分子，并且在积极分子帮助之下实现一切部门的党务工作和经济工作的领导。依靠党员积极分子——这就是任何地方党机关工作的成功基础。
    在提前完成战后五年计划的斗争中，每一个党委会和每一个党支部都必须解决巨大而繁重的任务。我们各级党机关的实际工作告诉我们：凡是能够顺利地完成任务的地方，那里的领导得必定是善于吸引党员积极分子参加工作，和他们商量问题，并且在他们的参加之下研究党组织和经济组织的工作，改善检查党的决议的执行。假若党员群众，而首先是党员积极分子被吸收来解决党内工作、群众政治工作和经济工作的各种问题，假若领导者能倾听他们的意见并考虑他们的经验的话，那么这些问题将会解决得更快更正确。
    培养和使用党员积极分子的最好形式，是组织各种党员积极分子的会议，来讨论工作。
    有了和党员群众不可分割的联系，并在日常工作中教育与锻炼党员积极分子——这就是各级党机关的力量，是他们工作成功的保证。例如：格里罗夫斯基的市委会，就是在党员积极分子——区委工作者，支部书记，宣传员，经济工作者，专家和生产革新者——的参与下解决党、政工作和经济工作的各种问题的。党的市委会时常举行党员积极分子会议，会上讨论城市党组织的当前首要任务，同时经常与这一或那一经济部门、文化部门中工作的党员们进行协商，举行支部书记和宣传员的联席会。市党委对积极分子进行工作的结果，使顿巴斯的巨大中心城市之一的企业能够保证国家任务胜利的完成。
    在进一步改善党组织的思想工作中，党员积极分子的作用是伟大而重要的。在实现联共（布）党中央委员会关于思想问题的决议时，各级党机关开始更广泛地吸引党员积极分子去讨论政治生活的问题，领导党员的政治教育和劳动群众中的群众政治工作，在党员积极分子中提拔了大批的政治学校和小组的领导干部，以及各种讲演者和报告者，党的工作者开始经常地做有关重要政治问题的报告和讲演。
    凡是不依靠党员积极分子的组织，就削弱了党与群众的联系，而走上事务主义与官僚主义领导方法的道路。
    但是培养党员积极分子的工作并不是到处都受到应有的注意的。有些地方党的领导者不喜欢培养积极分子，也不依靠他们，而宁愿和极狭小的一圈人搞工作，他们说：“少找麻烦吧！”但是这样的人却离开了布尔什维克的集体领导原则，削弱了与群众的联系，而走上事务主义、官僚主义的领导方法的道路。
    在鸠麦斯基州委会的工作实践中也暴露了类似这样的缺点，鸠麦斯基州委会纵容党组织、苏维埃组织和经济组织的领导方法的错误，不好好地解决各地提上来的问题，不深究各区的需要，不帮助他们，并很少听取市委会和区委会的工作报告、州的党组织中的党内工作和群众政治工作则被忽略了。州委会在干部工作中犯了错误，没有运用布尔什维克的批评和自我批评的精神，更没有用严守党纪和国家纪律的精神去教育党员积极分子和苏维埃的积极分子，这使党内产生了自满情绪和不负责任的风气。事务官僚主义的领导方法在鸠麦斯基州委会的实际工作中占了优势，与下级党组织的有机联系，简直少得可怜。
    党员积极分子会议，必须有充分准备的进行，以保证积极分子积极参加讨论党的任务，保证大胆开展批评与自我批评。
    正规的进行党员积极分子会议是正确领导党组织的工作的最重要的条件之一，斯大林同志指出：必须召集“一切工作部门的工作者——经济工作者，党务工作者，职工工作者，军事工作者——”的会议，“以便于会议能正规地进行，以便于在会议上提出它认为必须提出的问题，以便于各种专长的干部间的关系不致脱节，以便于使全体工作者都感觉自己是为一个不可分割的，一切人们的共同的事业——无产阶级的事业而奋斗的党的家庭中的一个成员。”
    党员积极分子会议帮助动员党组织的力量去解决当前任务，是布尔什维克批评和自我批评的场所，是教育积极分子本身的方法，根据联共（布）党党章，党员积极分子会议应该是召集来讨论一切加盟共和国的、区的、各州的中心区，以及在一切或大或小的大工业中心中党、政的最重要的决议的。在大的中心区就不仅应该召集城市的党员积极分子会议，而且应该召集区的党员积极分子会议。
    党员积极分子的会议是怎样举行的呢？很多地方的会议是非正规地召开着，并且是没做应有的准备地进行着的。例如在斯维得洛夫斯基城里，积极分子会议就曾经是这样进行的。
    在决定了举行城市积极分子会议讨论如何准备企业过冬的党组织的任务以后，市委会没有认真地研究问题，也没有认真地为积极分子会议上的讨论准备下具体的意见。市党委书记Ｔ·克拉斯诺任诺夫在自己的报告中更没有认真地彻底分析过冬准备的过程，也没有向党组织提出任务。市委书记不像是一个党的领导者，而倒像一个经济行政工作者，报告者使自己的错误更严重的是：把该市一百多党务工作者，苏维埃工作者和经济工作者一概批评得体无完肤，而所有这之中他很少谈起有关准备过冬的政治工作的任务。自然，这样的报告对促进实事求是的讨论问题和展开批评与自我批评是无所补益的，结果积极分子会议进行得很糟。
    党员积极分子会议——是布尔什维克教育干部的学校，是动员群众完成党和政府的决议的有效方法。为了使党员积极分子会议能实现自己的这个作用，那么就应该全面地、郑重地、深思熟虑地去从事它们的准备工作，在准备和举行党员积极分子会议时，必须真正保证积极分子积极参加讨论党组织的任务，保证大胆地开展布尔什维克的批评与自我批评。
    党组织进行着巨大的和各方面的完成共产主义建设的伟大任务的工作，在这个工作过程中，提高、教育、锻炼了我们的党员积极分子和党的干部——他们就是党的和国家的财宝。
    党组织的最起码的职责——就是经常地培养积极分子，不断地帮助他们提高自己的政治思想水平，帮助他们掌握列宁、斯大林党的伟大的所向无敌的武器——马列主义理论。
