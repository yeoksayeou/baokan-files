    Tibetan Sojourners in Lanzhou Hold Meeting
    Protest U.S.-British Plot to Invade Tibet
    Firmly Support the PLA's Advance into Tibet
    [This newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch, 27th] The U.S. and British imperialist plot to invade Tibet and the United Press report that the Tibetan authorities are attempting to sell out the interests of the Tibetan people have aroused great indignation among the 500,000 Tibetans in the Northwest. On the 26th, over a hundred Tibetan sojourners from all walks of life in Lanzhou held a forum at the famous Northwest Mansion, unanimously expressing their protest. Participants came from various Tibetan tribes in Labrang, Zhuoni, Qinghai, and the Sichuan-Kangding-Gansu border areas, including herdsmen, farmers, Tibetan women, educated youth, Tibetan soldiers, and democratic figures. The first to speak was Huang Zhengqing, a Tibetan soldier and current member of the Gansu Provincial People's Government. He emphasized: "After suffering a crushing defeat in supporting the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, the imperialists are still not reconciled and are now eagerly attempting to invade our southwestern border. Recently, the United Press reported that the Lhasa authorities sent so-called 'goodwill missions' to the United States, Britain, and other countries, declaring their 'independence.' This trick directed by the imperialists will inevitably be met with fierce opposition from all the people of China. We firmly support the statement of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, because it truly represents the wishes of every Tibetan. We will mobilize the Tibetan people to warmly welcome and support the People's Liberation Army's great march to liberate Tibet."
    Yang Fuxing, the former Tusi of the Tibetan Dao of Zhuoni and current member of the Gansu Provincial People's Government, said: "We will never allow the Tibetan sacred land of Tibet to be reduced to a colony of U.S. and British imperialism. We have seen the unprecedented strength of the world's democratic forces, and we have also seen the powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army. The complete liberation of Chinese territory cannot be stopped by any force." Cai Zhizhong, a Tibetan educated youth, spoke with overflowing excitement after liberation, saying: "We Tibetan people have never had such a grand gathering during the Kuomintang's rule. I am very honored to participate in this meeting. Before liberation, I suffered the pain of the Kuomintang's brutal oppression. I was very happy to come here to study after Lanzhou was liberated; I have deeply realized that only with the great unity of all brotherly nationalities in the country can the Tibetan people be liberated. We must do everything we can to support our own army—the Chinese People's Liberation Army." Ce Ren Na Mu, a Tibetan woman, gave a brief and powerful speech that resonated with the entire audience and received enthusiastic applause. She said: "I am thirty-three years old this year, and I have only ever heard that Tibet is Chinese territory. The Tibetan, Han, and Hui nationalities are like the five fingers of a hand, and they cannot be separated. We have now begun a life of equality and happiness, but we know that our Tibetan compatriots in Tibet are still suffering greatly. Standing from the position of Tibetan women, I request the People's Liberation Army to liberate Tibet as soon as possible." Huan Zhou Ren Rang from the Qinghai tribe, Shi Danbo, who once served as the Tibetan secretary to the Fifth Jiamuyang of Labrang Monastery for nine years, and the uprising representative from the Achan tribe who came from afar, all stated in their speeches that China's sacred territory is inviolable, and we must resolutely implement the Common Program of the CPPCC, thoroughly liberate all the country's territory, support the PLA's advance into Tibet, and save the people from the abyss of suffering. Finally, Sun Zuobin, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee, was invited to speak. He pointed out: The Tibetan people's desire for the early liberation of Tibet will surely be realized. He also called on everyone to step up their studies in order to serve the Tibetan people wholeheartedly and build a prosperous and happy new Tibetan region. The conference also passed telegrams of respect to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the Northwest Military and Political Committee.

    藏族旅兰各界人士集会
    抗议美英侵藏阴谋
    坚决支援解放军进军西藏
    【本报兰州二十七日专电】美英帝国主义阴谋侵略西藏及美国合众社所传西藏当局企图出卖藏族人民利益的消息，引起西北五十万藏族人民极大愤慨。二十六日，藏族旅兰各界人士百余人，在著名的西北大厦集会座谈，一致表示抗议。到有来自拉卜楞、卓尼、青海、川康甘边等地各部落藏族人民，包括牧民、农民、藏族妇女、知识青年、藏族军人、民主人士等。第一个发言的是藏族军人、现任甘肃省人民政府委员黄正清。他着重指出：“帝国主义支持蒋介石反动集团遭受惨败之后仍不甘心，现又亟图侵略我国西南边疆。最近合众社传拉萨当局派出所谓“亲善使团”，分赴美英等国，表明其“独立”，帝国主义导演的这一鬼把戏，必然遭受全中国人民的激烈反对，我们坚决拥护中央人民政府外交部发言人的谈话，因为它真正代表了每个藏民的心愿。我们将动员藏族人民，热情地欢迎与支援人民解放军解放西藏的大进军。”
    前卓尼藏道土司、现任甘肃省人民政府委员杨复兴说：“我们决不让藏民圣地西藏沦为美英帝国主义的殖民地。我们已看见世界民主力量的空前强大，我们也看到了强大的中国人民解放军，中国领土的全部解放，是任何力量都阻止不住的。”藏民知识青年蔡之中的发言，洋溢着解放后的兴奋，他说：“我们藏族人民，在国民党统治时期从来没有过这样盛大的集会，参加这个会，我感到十分荣幸。解放前我尝受过国民党残酷压迫的痛苦，兰州解放了，我很高兴地到这里学习；我已深切觉悟到，只有全国各兄弟民族的大团结，藏族人民才能得到解放。我们要尽一切力量，支援自己的军队——中国人民解放军。”藏族妇女策仁娜姆简短有力的讲话，引起全场的共鸣与热烈的鼓掌。她说：“我今年三十三岁，从来只听说西藏是中国的领土。藏族和汉、回等民族犹如手的五指，是不能分割的。我们现在已开始了平等愉快的生活，但我们深知西藏男女同胞还遭受着很大痛苦。我站在藏族妇女立场上，请求解放军早日解放西藏。”青海部落环周仁让、曾任拉卜楞寺嘉木样五世九年藏文秘书的释淡泊、远道赶来的阿产部落的起义代表等多人发言中，均一致表示：中国神圣的国土不容丝毫侵犯，我们要坚决执行人民政协共同纲领，彻底解放全国一切国土，支援解放军进军西藏，拯人民于水火之中。最后中共甘肃省委副书记孙作宾被邀讲话。他指出：藏族人民渴望早日解放西藏，这是一定会实现的。他并号召大家加紧学习，以便全心全意为藏民服务，建设康乐幸福的新藏道。大会并通过分别向毛主席、朱总司令及西北军政委员会致敬的电报。
