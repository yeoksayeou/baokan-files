    The Disasters of the Marshall Plan
    Price Hikes and Increased Unemployment in France, Belgium, and Other Countries
    Thousands of Stores Close in France
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th] France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, under the Marshall Plan, are mired in an increasingly serious economic disaster. In December 1949 alone, 437 stores closed in France. Last year, a total of 3,398 closed, and 1,167 underwent property liquidation according to law. In 1948, 2,102 stores closed and 552 underwent property liquidation.
    Belgian Shipbuilding Industry Faces Crisis
    The crisis in the Belgian shipbuilding industry can be seen from the increase in unemployment figures. At the beginning of 1949, 18,000 people were employed in the Belgian shipbuilding industry, but by the end of the year, this had fallen to 10,300. The average number of new orders received by shipbuilders per month fell from 225 million Belgian francs at the beginning of last year to 160 million francs.
            Price Hikes and Increased Unemployment in the Netherlands
    According to conservative official figures, at the end of November last year, there were 62,700 unemployed in the Netherlands, 13,500 more than in October. The largest increases in unemployment were in the construction and agriculture sectors. The wholesale price index in the Netherlands rose to 297 in November (with the average for 1938 and 1939 as 100), 2 points higher than in October. The raw material price index rose by 9 points. The wholesale price index for food and agricultural products also rose sharply. Compared with 1948, food prices rose by 13 points, raw material prices rose by 22 points, and manufactured goods prices rose by 14 points. Rising prices are a direct result of the devaluation of the Dutch currency.
            Large Numbers of Factories Close in Turkey, Unemployment Soars
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th] Under the Marshall Plan, Turkish factories are closing one after another, and the number of unemployed workers is increasing daily. According to Turkish newspaper reports: 25 silk factories in Izmir have recently closed, leaving around 1,000 workers unemployed. The textile industry is laying off large numbers of workers. One textile factory in Izmir laid off 257 workers in a single day on the 2nd. The iron industry crisis is also growing. Due to poor harvests, tens of thousands of farmers are unable to make a living, further increasing the number of unemployed. Although the Istanbul Regional Industrial Conference has decided to reduce the daily working hours from eight to five hours, factory owners, for the sake of profit, refuse to implement it and continue to lay off workers while maintaining the eight-hour workday. Even the pro-American Turkish newspaper Vatan raised objections, saying: "The closure of large numbers of silk factories is a result of the large-scale import of rayon from the United States."

    马歇尔计划的灾祸
    法比等国物价上涨失业激增
    法国数千商店倒闭
    【新华社北京九日电】马歇尔化的法、比、荷三国正陷于日益严重的经济灾难中。仅在一九四九年十二月内，法国就有四百三十七家商店倒闭。去年一年共有三千三百九十八家倒闭，一千一百六十七家依法清理财产。在一九四八年，倒闭的商店则为二千一百零二家，清理财产的五百五十二家。
    比利时造船业面临危机
    比利时造船业的危机，可由失业数字的增加中看出。一九四九年初，比利时造船业中有一万八千人就业，到年底下降到一万零三百人。造船主收到的新定单，每月平均数由去年年初的二亿二千五百万比利时法郎下降到一亿六千万法郎。
            荷兰物价上涨失业增加
    据保守的官方数字，在去年十一月底，荷兰失业者为六万二千七百人，比十月份多一万三千五百人。失业增加最多的是建筑业和农业。荷兰的批发物价指数在十一月份上升到二九七点（以一九三八和一九三九年的平均数为一百），比十月份多二点。原料价格指数上升九点。食粮和农产品批发价格指数，也急剧上升。与一九四八年比较，食粮价格上涨十三点，原料价格上涨二十二点，制造品价格上涨十四点。物价上涨是荷兰货币贬值的直接结果。
            土耳其大批工厂关门失业工人激增
    【新华社北京九日电】在马歇尔计划下，土耳其工厂纷纷倒闭，失业工人日增。据土耳其报纸消息：伊斯密尔的丝厂，最近有二十五家关门，一千左右工人失业。纺织业正在大量解雇工人，伊斯密尔的一家纺织厂，在二日一天就解雇了二百五十七个工人。铁工业危机也在增长。由于歉收，成千成万农民无法生活，更加多了失业者的数量，伊斯坦堡区工业会议虽已决定把每日工作八小时减为五小时，但厂主为了利润拒不实行，仍继续解雇工人，维持每日八小时的工作。甚至亲美的土耳其报纸瓦坦报也提出责难说：“大批丝厂关门，是由于美国大量输入人造丝的结果。”
