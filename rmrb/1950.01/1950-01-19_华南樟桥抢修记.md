    Record of the Emergency Repair of the Zhang Bridge in South China
    Jian Qun
    Zhang Bridge is the second highest bridge in China. Before their retreat, the Chiang bandits completely destroyed it. Soldiers of the Railway Corps and railway employees, with selfless effort, repaired it in just over forty days.
            One: A Glimpse of Zhang Bridge
    The nationally famous high bridge—the Zhang River Bridge—was resurrected on the morning of December 23rd last year. With its enormous and majestic body, it spans the sixty-eight meters separating two towering concrete cliffs facing north and south. Standing on the bridgehead and looking down, the two steel towers, each about twenty-nine meters high, on the river beach look like two six-story Western-style buildings, standing on two large concrete piers three meters high. These two steel towers support two eighteen-meter-long, twenty-eight-ton steel beams and one thirty-meter-long, sixty-eight-ton steel beam. The Zhang River flows from west to east. The total height of the Zhang Bridge, including the concrete piers, steel towers, six-layer I-beams, and the steel beams themselves, is more than thirty-nine meters, second only to Bridge No. 8 on the Longhai Railway in the country.
            Two: Angry Recollections
    During the Mid-Autumn Festival in August 1949, the Chiang bandits' engineer battalion, hiding in Baishidu, under the conspiracy and instigation of the White bandit Chongxi, used a locomotive to drag two fifteen-ton boxcars full of explosives, from south to north, and successively blew up four large bridges: Luojiadu, Xin’yanxia, Xiaoxi, and Zhang River. The two concrete piers of the Zhang Bridge, each about thirty-four meters high, were blown to pieces. The steel rails of the bridge were blown to both sides of the cliffs by the explosives. The original steel beams were blown into twists and bends, some lying in the water and some sinking into the sand.
    When the author passed by Baishidu Station, station worker Meng Xianheng said with angry tones: "That bastard Bai Chongxi had been preparing to blow up the bridge for a long time. Not long after the liberation of Wuhan, Bai Chongxi's engineer battalion ran to Baishidu, and they spent more than two months just drilling holes for the explosives. Each hole was one meter deep. After drilling the holes, they rehearsed it more than a dozen times. I don't know how much manpower and money was spent on these bridges, and now they have all been ruined."
            Three: Cordial Meeting
    On November 6th last year, the Hengyang shock brigade, composed of underground Communist Party members among the employees of the Hengyang Railway Bureau as its backbone, rushed to this rubble-strewn river beach with fervent enthusiasm, and began to clean up the damaged concrete piers and shattered steel. Soon, a part of the Changsha Bridge Team, the Hengyang Bridge Team, and the Liling Bridge Team also arrived. These four groups of workers formed the Fourth Bridge Team of the Hengyang Railway Bureau, shouldering the arduous task of repairing the Zhang Bridge.
    On the morning of December 2nd, a line battalion of a certain regiment of the Railway Corps, on the third day after completing the repair of the Lei River Bridge, also arrived at the head of the Zhang Bridge. When this labor army, possessing strong manpower and good at overcoming difficulties, appeared at the construction site, the workers happily crowded around, holding the hands of the comrades of the Railway Corps tightly and saying: "You have come, that's even better. We have already cleaned up the concrete piers, and we will start pouring concrete tomorrow!"
    "That's right!" The comrades of the Railway Corps replied enthusiastically. They also said modestly: "Last time when we repaired the Lei River Bridge, we learned a lot from the Changsha Bridge Team. This time we have to learn from you even more. We have never repaired such a high bridge!"
    "We should learn from you. We have long admired your spirit of hard struggle and fearlessness of difficulties!"
    "We still need you to guide us technically."
    "We still need you to help us politically!"
    "We must all unite as one!"
            Four: Pouring Concrete
    From December 3rd, on the beaches of the Zhang River, the roadbeds, and steep slopes, a fierce and tense large-scale emergency repair battle unfolded. The Fifth Company of the Twenty-Sixth Line Battalion was responsible for transporting ballast from a place one hundred li away from the bridge to the construction site. They only slept for twelve hours in three days and three nights. On the morning of the 8th, after completing the task assigned by the higher authorities to transport eight carloads of ballast in one day, they did not even wait for lunch and returned to the place where they loaded stones. Encouraged by the mutual assistance and competition among the squads and platoons, as soon as the sun set, they loaded another six carloads. They only ate one meal from 4:30 in the morning to 11:00 at night, but they were very happy because they completed three-quarters more work than assigned by the higher authorities.
    On the steep slopes on both sides of the river, the comrades responsible for transporting cement looked like cement people, their clothes and faces completely covered in cement. A bag of cement weighing more than one hundred jin was pressed on each comrade's shoulder. They climbed the steep slope, panting, and handed it to other comrades, then turned around and quickly went to carry the second bag. Throughout the day's work, except for the time for lunch, the only rest they had was when they walked back empty-handed after carrying a bag. The cement produced heat when it came into contact with sweat, and everyone's shoulders were swollen and sore, but the soldiers thought: "In order to quickly open the Yuehan Railway and support the front, we are happy to endure any hardship and fatigue." A workers' team leader asked the soldiers of the Fourth Company if they were tired. They pointed to the Third Platoon Leader Cao Ruilin and said: "What's this? Look at our Third Platoon Leader, he carries two bags at a time."
            Five: Never Seen in a Lifetime
    On the beaches on both sides of the river, from the narrow stream to the tall concrete formwork, many high and low planks were set up. Some comrades carried cement mixed with sand, some carried large baskets of stones, and some carried river water, one closely following another, like a revolving lantern, delivering them to the iron plate for mixing cement. The workers mixing the cement, with iron shovels in hand, skillfully mixed the cement stones and water, and pushed it under the iron plate. The workers under the iron plate and the comrades of the Railway Corps were wet and dirty from head to toe with cement and water. When someone wanted to replace them, they firmly refused.
    Zhao Jiutang, the deputy political instructor of the Ninth Company, told me a very interesting thing. When their team first arrived, the people were all scared away. After they stayed for two days, the people liked them very much. Every midnight, after the comrades finished their work, they happily sang songs as they walked back to their residence. The old men and women in the village, hearing the singing, carried lanterns to the door to light the way for the team, repeatedly saying: "You've worked hard! You've worked hard! You're coming back so late!" A pharmacist said: "I have lived for forty years, including reading old novels, and I have never seen an army like yours. You People's Liberation Army are truly concerned about the worries of the world before enjoying its pleasures, truly a good army of the people!"
            Six: Braving the Rain to Erect Steel Towers
    From the evening of December 8th, it rained for two nights in a row. The rainwater turned the calm and slender Zhang River into a roaring raging wave. The steep slopes on both sides became particularly muddy and slippery. Early in the morning of the 9th, the team arrived at the construction site in the pouring rain. The comrades heard that the higher authorities had ordered them to rebuild the pontoon bridge that had been washed away by the water. Communist Party member Liu Xikui did not hesitate to take off his clothes and go into the water. Platoon Leader Che Zhian and several soldiers followed closely and jumped into the water. In the cold current of December, the brave men launched a fierce battle.
    On the 9th, two layers of steel towers were completed on both the north and south sides. The 10th was the most tense and moving day of the entire Zhang Bridge project. Early in the morning, the political department of the brigade issued the appeal of the on-site committee to the workers and soldiers. The appeal wrote: "The on-site committee appeals: Today, we will erect the third layer of steel towers, complete the steel towers on the 12th, and start installing the I-beams on the 14th." After reading the appeal, the workers smiled and said to the comrades of the troops: "If you guarantee to supply the steel columns, we are determined to complete the six layers of steel towers today!" "Good!" The comrades of the troops shouted happily. Company Commander Wang Lei, Deputy Company Commander Jin Changtong, and Deputy Political Instructor Nan Zhengzhen each participated in a group. The soldiers were especially energetic when they saw the company cadres also participating. A steel column weighing more than a thousand jin was continuously transported to the concrete pier at a rapid pace. The workers tensely tied it with a steel rope, and the soldiers pulling the rope formed a snake-like formation, cheering and hoisting the steel column into the air. The workers standing on top of the steel tower quickly placed the steel column in position, untied the steel rope, and threw it down from the high top. The soldiers carrying the steel columns and cross braces saw that the steel tower was rising higher and higher quickly, and they were very happy. Fang Xianglie and three others picked up a steel column and ran. The other comrades did not want to show weakness. Those who were originally designated to have twelve people carry a column because of their young age and weak bodies now lifted it with eight people. Platoon Leader Cao Ruilin carried five ＾-shaped irons on his back alone, weighing more than two hundred jin, which aroused cheers from everyone. Fang Xianglie, after carrying the steel column, carried four cross braces on his back alone, causing everyone to cheer. Nearby workers repeatedly shouted "Good!" and competed to inquire who was carrying the four cross braces. The soldiers told them that it was Fang Xianglie, a hero with two major merits. The soldiers also competed to inquire who was the hero who climbed the highest on the north side. The workers told them that it was Li Chao. The names of Li Chao and Fang Xianglie quickly spread throughout the entire north construction site. At 12:00 noon, the north side completed five layers of steel towers, and the south side also reached the fifth layer. At this time, lunch was delivered, and the workers on top of the steel tower shouted loudly: "We will not come down to eat until the sixth layer is completed!" The comrades of the troops also shouted to the cooks below: "We will not eat lunch, let's finish it and go home for dinner!"
            Seven: Not Afraid of Sharp Knives!
    The completion of the steel towers two days ahead of schedule created a favorable foundation for the early completion of the entire project. On the 13th, the on-site committee convened a meeting of all personnel to mobilize the completion of the bridge two days ahead of schedule. According to the original plan, the I-beams were to be installed on the 14th, but this work had already begun on the 12th, so by breakfast on the 14th, all the I-beams had been installed. Due to the lack of a bridge-building machine to lift the thirty-ton steel beams, it was necessary to adopt a more cumbersome method of lifting the steel beams. First, two to five military beams must be erected on each empty bridge, and then two to four log piers must be built on top of them. Each log pier is three meters high and has a total of twelve layers. A layer of rails must also be buckled on top of the log piers, and then the log rails must be supplemented. The steel beams are transported to each empty bridge by flatcar, and then the steel beams are lifted with a gallows, and then the rails, logs, buckled rails, log piers, and military beams below are completely removed, allowing the steel beams to slowly fall down. This complex, dangerous, and skilled work was largely shouldered by the workers. Faced with dangerous and tense situations, the workers demonstrated the fearless heroic spirit of the working class. At 12:00 noon on the 20th, the on-site committee brought in the workers from the Hengyang Bridge Team, asking them to complete the work of erecting four log piers and buckled rails on the thirty-meter-long operational beam before 12:00 noon tomorrow. The workers said: "No need for tomorrow morning, we can complete it tonight!" "What if it rains heavily?" The workers firmly said: "Not afraid of sharp knives!" A veteran worker gave a more detailed explanation. He said: "Of course, heavy rain will take a little more effort, because it is inconvenient to move our feet, so we have to be more careful and slower when working. But no matter what, we must work the night shift and complete it tonight." At night, the workers worked silently and tensely in the pale electric light and in the misty rain. Finally, before 12:00 at night, they completed the most dangerous and arduous task.
            Eight: A Meaningful Banquet
    December 22nd coincided with the seventieth birthday of the world's revolutionary teacher Comrade Stalin. At night, in the southern mountains, in a simple dining car, a simple and meaningful banquet was held. Temporarily installed electric lights added a festive atmosphere and radiance to the dining car. During the banquet, Soviet engineer Zhirnov gave a brief introduction to the Soviet construction situation after the Soviet-German War. He loudly and excitedly said: "In the Soviet Union, there are no contradictions between engineers and workers. There is only close cooperation and mutual learning." After Comrade Zhirnov finished speaking, Mr. Li Shaochang, the designer of the Zhang Bridge, stood up emotionally. He said: "I used to have many wrong ideas. I thought that engineers were everything in the project, and the workers just did what the engineers said. They would not come up with any good ideas, nor could they participate in leadership and planning. After the Liberation Army came, I realized that this was wrong. In the old Kuomintang era, many bridges were also built, and a lot of manpower and materials were used, but the construction was very slow. Now? To be honest, it is much faster than before. There is no other reason for this. It is just because the Liberation Army trusts the workers, allows the workers to participate in leadership, and gives full play to the workers' creativity and wisdom. I used to work as an engineer in the old society. I worked very hard and was very responsible in the project. At that time, on the surface, it was for the country, but in fact, it was entirely for my personal reputation and higher salary. In the new society, I feel that my work is not only for myself, but indeed for the people and for the motherland. I lived in the old society for more than forty years, and only a few months in the new society, but these few months have been a great change for me!" "Horosho!" The Soviet comrade smiled with satisfaction. The translator told Mr. Li: "The Soviet comrade wants to shake hands with you warmly. He welcomes your speech very much." The meeting ended. On the way to the bridgehead, it was seen that the thirty-meter steel beam had already fallen. There was obviously no problem with the opening of the traffic on the 23rd.

    华南樟桥抢修记
    简群
    樟桥是我国第二高桥。蒋匪撤退前把它彻底炸毁。铁道兵团的战士、铁路员工以忘我的努力，四十多天就把它修复了。
            一  樟桥一瞥
    全国著名的高桥——樟河大桥，在去年十二月二十三日早晨复活了。它以巨大雄伟的身躯，横跨在相距六十八米南北对峙的两个洋灰峭壁上。站在桥头向下望去，河滩上两座高约二十九米的钢塔，好像两栋六层洋楼，屹立在两座三米高的大洋灰墩上。这两座钢塔支托住两座十八米长二十八吨重和一座三十米长六十八吨重的钢梁。樟水由西流向东方。整个樟桥的高度，连洋灰墩、钢塔、六层工字梁和钢梁本身算上，一共有三十九米多，在全国来说，仅次于陇海线上的八号桥。
            二  愤怒的回忆
    一九四九年八月中秋节，隐匿在白石渡的蒋匪工兵营，在白匪崇禧的阴谋指使下，用机车拖着两个满载炸药的十五吨车皮，由南而北，连续炸毁了罗家渡、新岩下、小溪、樟河等四座大桥。樟桥两座高约三十四米的洋灰墩，被炸得粉身碎骨。桥梁的钢轨被炸药掀到峭壁的两边。原有的钢梁被炸得弯扭曲折，有的躺在水中，有的陷入沙滩里。
    当笔者路过白石渡车站时，站上的扬旗工友孟宪珩用愤怒的语调说：“白崇禧这个王八蛋早就准备炸桥啦。武汉解放不久，白崇禧的工兵营就跑到白石渡来，光凿放炸药的窟窿就凿了两个多月。每一个窟窿有一米深。凿好了窟窿以后，还演习了十几回呢。这几座大桥不知用了多少人工，费了多少钱财，现在都糟践了。”
            三  亲热的会晤
    去年十一月六日，以衡阳路局员工中的地下共产党员为骨干组成的衡阳突击队，带着狂热的心情，赶到这遍地瓦砾的河滩中，开始清扫残破的洋灰墩，和碎裂的钢铁。不久，长沙桥梁队的一部分，衡阳桥工队和醴陵桥工队也赶到这里。这四部分工友合组成一个衡阳路局第四桥梁队。担负起抢修樟桥的艰巨任务。
    十二月二日上午，铁道兵团某支队的一个线路大队，在修完耒河大桥后的第三天，也赶到樟桥桥头。当这支拥有强大人力和善于克服困难的劳动大军出现在工地时，工友们一个个高兴地挤上来，用粗大的手紧紧拉住铁道兵团同志们的手说：“你们来了，这更好了。我们已经把洋灰墩子清理好了，明天开始打洋灰吧！”
    “对！”铁道兵团的同志热情地回答。他们并谦虚的说：“上次修耒河桥时候，我们跟长沙桥梁队学了不少东西，这回更得好好地向你们学习学习。我们从来没有修过这样高的桥啊！”
    “我们应该向你们学习，你们的艰苦奋斗作风和不怕困难的精神，我们早就很佩服的！”
    “还得要你们多指导我们技术。”
    “还得要你们在政治上多帮助我们！”
    “我们大家要团结一致！”
            四  打洋灰
    从十二月三日起，在樟河两岸的沙滩、道床、陡坡上面，展开了一场激烈紧张的巨大规模的抢修战斗。二十六线路大队五连担负从桥北一百里外装运石碴到工地的工作。他们三天三夜只睡了十二个钟头。八号上午，他们在完成上级给的一天装运八车石碴的任务后，连午饭也不肯等着吃，又随车返回装石头的地方。在班排互助挑战、互相竞赛的鼓舞下，太阳刚一落山，又装满了六车。他们从早晨四点半到夜里十一点钟。只吃了一顿饭，但是他们非常高兴，因为他们完成了比上级分配的还要多四分之三的工作。
    在河两岸陡峭的山坡上，担任运洋灰的同志，一个个好像洋灰人似的，衣服和手脸完全被洋灰罩住。一百多斤一袋的洋灰，压在每个同志的肩膀上，爬上陡坡，气喘喘的交给别的同志，又转身快步去搬运第二袋。一整天的工作，除了吃上午饭的时间以外，只有搬完一袋往回返时空着手走，那就算是休息。洋灰碰到汗水，发出热力，大家的肩膀被压得又肿又痛，可是战士们想着：“为了很快修通粤汉，支援前方，再艰苦再疲劳也很乐意。”一个工人队的队长问四连战士，疲劳不疲劳，他们指着三排长曹瑞林说：“这算什么，看看我们三排长，他一个人一次掮两袋呢。”
            五  一辈子没有见过
    在河两岸的沙滩上，从窄窄的流水到高大的洋灰模型板上边，搭着许多高高低低的跳板。同志们有的抬着掺好沙子的洋灰，有的抬着大筐石头，有的挑着河水，一个紧跟一个，像走马灯一样送到拌洋灰的铁板上。拌洋灰的工友，拿着铁锨，熟练地把洋灰石子和水拌好，推到铁板下面。铁板下的工友和铁道兵团的同志们，一个个从头到脚被洋灰和水弄的又湿又脏，有人要替换他们，他们坚决不肯让换。
    九连的副政指赵九堂告诉我一件很有兴趣的事。当他们队伍刚来时，老百姓都吓跑了。他们住了两天以后，老百姓又特别喜欢他们了。每天夜半，同志们完工以后，高兴的唱着歌走回驻地。村庄里的老爹爹和老婆婆听见歌声，一个个提着灯笼到门外给队伍照路，连声的说：“辛苦了！辛苦了！你们这样晚才回来啊！”一个药铺先生说：“我活了四十年，连着旧小说书也算上，从来没有看见过你们这样的军队。你们解放军真是先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐，真是人民的好队伍啊！”
            六  冒雨立钢塔
    从十二月八号晚上起，连下了两夜雨。雨水把平静瘦小的樟河变成咆哮的怒涛。两岸陡峭的坡道，变得特别泥泞而湿滑。九号一清早，队伍在大雨淋漓中赶到了工地。同志们听说上级命令重搭被水冲坏的浮桥，共产党员刘喜魁毫不迟疑，脱光了就下水，排长车治安和几个战士，紧跟着都跳下水去。在十二月的寒流中，勇士们展开了一场激烈地搏斗。
    九号一天，南北两头上完了两层钢塔。十号，整个樟桥工程中最紧张最动人的一天到来了。一清早，大队政治处就把现场委员会的号召发到工友和战士手中。号召上面写着：“现场委员会号召：今日上三层钢塔，十二号上完钢塔，十四号开始上工字梁。”工友们看完号召后，笑着对部队同志说：“如果你们保证供得上钢柱，我们下决心今天上完六层钢塔！”“好！”部队同志高兴得叫起来了。中队长王雷、中队副金长童，副政治教员南政镇一人参加一组。战士们看见中队干部也来参加，格外有劲。一千多斤重一根钢柱，在飞快的脚步下，源源不断的运到洋灰墩边。工友们紧张地用钢绳捆好，拉绳的战士摆着长蛇似的队形，一阵欢呼，把钢柱吊到半空。站在钢塔顶上的工友，迅速地把钢柱放好位置，解下钢绳，从高高的顶上扔了下来。搬运钢柱和横撑的战士看见钢塔很快的越上越高，一阵高兴，方相烈等四个人抬起一根钢柱就跑。其他同志也不示弱，本来岁数小身体弱指定十二人抬一根的同志，这时八个人就抬起来了。排长曹瑞林一个人背了五根共重二百几十斤的＾字形铁。方相烈，抬完钢柱后，一个人又背了四根横撑引起了大家的喝彩声。附近的工友连声喊好，一个个争着打听背四根横撑的是谁。战士们告知他们，这是两大功功臣方相烈。战士们见了工友，也争着打听北头登得最高的英雄是谁，工友们告知这是李超。李超和方相烈的名子，很快的传遍了整个的北头工地。上午十二点钟，北头上完五层钢塔，南头也上到第五层。这时，午饭送来了，工友们在钢塔顶上大声的说：“不把六层上完，坚决不下来吃饭！”部队同志也向下面的炊事员喊：“午饭不吃了，上完了再回家吃晚饭吧！”
            七  下尖刀子也不怕！
    由于上钢塔提前两天完成任务，造成了整个工程提前完成的有利基础。十三号，现场委员会召集全体人员开了个会，动员提前二天将桥修成。十四号按预定计划是上工字梁，但是这工作十二日就已开始，因此在十四日早饭前，工字梁已全部上完了。由于缺乏上三十吨钢梁的架桥机，不得不采用较笨的上钢梁办法。首先要在每空桥上架好两片到五片军用梁，再在上面搭两个到四个的道木垛，每个道木垛有三米高，共十二层。在道木垛上面还要扣一层铁轨，在扣轨上面，还要补道木铁轨，用平车把钢梁运到每空桥上，然后用人字形拔竿吊起钢梁，再把下面的铁轨、道木、扣轨、道木垛、军用梁完全拆掉，让钢梁慢慢落下来。这种复杂危险而又需要熟练技术的工作，极大部分担负在工友身上，面临着危险紧张的情况，工友们越表现出工人阶级的大无畏的英雄气概。二十日上午十二点，现场委员会把衡阳桥工队的工友找来，要他们在明日上午十二点前，完成三十米运用梁上搭四个道木垛和扣轨的工作。工友们说：“不用明天上午，今晚就可完成！”“如果要下大雨呢？”工友们坚决地说：“下尖刀子也不怕！”一个老练的工友，作了更详细的解释。他说：“下大雨当然要费点事，因为脚手不方便，干活就要小心些和慢些。但是不管怎样，我们一定要打夜班，一定要今天晚上完成。”夜晚，工友们在淡白的电灯光下，在蒙蒙细雨中，不声不响地紧张工作。终于在晚上十二点前，完成了最危险最艰巨的任务。
            八  一个有意义的宴会
    十二月二十二日，正逢世界革命导师斯大林同志七十寿辰到来。夜晚，在南方的丛山峻岭中，在一个简陋的饭车上，举行了一个简单而有意义的宴会，临时按设的电灯，给饭车增加了一番喜气和光辉。席间苏联工程师日尔诺夫把苏德战争后苏联建设情况作了一番介绍，他大声而兴奋地说：“在苏联，工程师和工人是没有矛盾的，有的只是亲密无间的合作，只是互相学习。”日尔诺夫同志讲完话后，樟桥工程设计人李绍昌先生感动的站起来。他说：“我以前有许多错误想法，我认为在工程中工程师是决定一切的，工友们只是按照工程师的话去做，不会出什么好主意，也不能参加领导和计划。解放军来了以后，我才知道这是错了。以前国民党时代也修了许多桥，人工用了不少，材料用了不少，可是修得很慢。现在呢？老实说，比以前快多了，这没有别的原因，就因为解放军信赖工友，让工友参加领导，发挥了工人的创造和智慧。我以前在旧社会里当工程师，自己在工程中也很努力，也很负责。那个时候，表面上说是为国家，实际上完全是为我个人名誉和更高的薪俸。在新社会中，我才感觉到我的工作不光是为自己，而且的的确确是为了人民，为了祖国。我在旧社会中生活了四十几年，在新社会中只很短的几个月时间，可是这几个月对于我是一个很大的变化啊！”“嗬拉唆！”苏联同志满意地笑。翻译同志转告李先生说：“苏联同志要和你亲热的握一下手，他很欢迎你的讲话。”散会了，在走向桥头的路途中，看见三十米钢梁已经落下。二十三日通车显然毫无问题了。
