Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 25th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in the Zhangzhou area of Fujian, in coordination with the people's armed forces of Zhangpu, Pinghe, and Nanjing counties, annihilated the bandit gang "Lianglong (Longxi, Longyan) Guerrilla Team," which had sneaked into the Pinghe and Nanjing areas from Jinmen Island, earlier this month. Captured bandits included Major General Commander He Kequan, Political Department Director Liu Ruicang, Chief of Staff Huang Hua, Deputy Commander of the First Detachment He Yaolian, Commander of the Second Detachment Zhang Sifan, Commander of the Fourth Detachment Zhao Maifei, and 105 others; eight bandits were killed. Sixty-four carbines, twelve short guns, one two-way radio, and thirty grenades were seized. This bandit gang was formed by selecting bandit army officers from the remnant bandits on Jinmen Island, attempting to sneak into the mainland to carry out various sabotage activities. The first batch of more than fifty people sneaked into the mainland near Nanjiangjun'ao, Zhangpu County, on the evening of the 27th of last month. After being discovered, our People's Liberation Army immediately set up a dragnet to surround the bandit gang and completely annihilated them in Emei Mountain, Pinghe County. Another batch of more than one hundred people sneaked into the mainland from Jiangjun'ao on the 2nd and then split into two groups to flee. One group of forty-two people was caught up and annihilated by our army in Nanpu Village, Nanjing County. The other group of dozens of people was also surrounded and annihilated by the people's armed forces of Nanjing, Pinghe, and Zhangpu counties in Chenshan, Nanjing County.
