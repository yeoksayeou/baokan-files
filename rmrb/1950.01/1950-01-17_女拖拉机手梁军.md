    Female Tractor Driver Liang Jun
    Gu Lei
    Liang Jun is twenty-one years old this year. She was born into a poor peasant family in Dede County, Heilongjiang Province. Because her family was poor, she didn't start elementary school in the county until she was thirteen. She dropped out of school before finishing junior elementary. To make a living, she weeded for landlords, mended sacks, and swept courtyards in the winter. Before liberation, she lived a life of hardship.
    In March 1947, the People's Government established the Mengya Normal School in Dede. In May, she resolutely left home to continue her studies. She said, "At that time, I just thought about gaining more knowledge so that I could earn a living in the future, so I wouldn't have to revolve around the stove all my life."
    The Dede Mengya Normal School was built by the students themselves. It was a new type of school that closely combined labor and learning. All the male and female students actively participated in labor, learning to spin, weave, cultivate wasteland, and farm. Liang Jun was very familiar with this kind of life. With the help of the principal and teachers, and through study and labor, she gradually understood what kind of party the Communist Party was, and how she should work hard to study and strive for a bright future.
    In 1948, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party opened a tractor training class. The school decided to send people to study. Liang Jun felt this was a good opportunity and insisted on going. So she and two male students went to Bei'an.
    She was very happy when she went, but she encountered difficulties everywhere when she arrived in Bei'an. Among the seventy-odd tractor trainees, she was the only woman. The mechanic asked her, "What did you come here for?" Liang Jun said, "To learn how to drive a tractor!" The mechanic said, "Go back! You can't drive this, it's too dirty!" The male students were also muttering, "A woman is here to learn how to drive a fire plow!" Many people didn't approve of accepting female students, thinking that women couldn't do this. Fortunately, the principal supported her and kept her.
    Throughout the learning process, the principal constantly encouraged her, and she herself worked even harder. Once, when the mechanic was lecturing, she didn't dare to reach out because she didn't understand the machine, fearing that she would make a mistake and break something. Who knew that the mechanic would say that she was afraid of getting dirty and didn't want to reach out, and criticized her. But she still insisted on learning with full enthusiasm.
    She listened carefully every time the mechanic disassembled the machine for lectures. She experimented once and twice, and asked questions when she didn't understand. And she ran to the machine, crawled under the machine, to look carefully and ponder carefully. The weather was cold, and she shivered all over, but she didn't care. In two months, she succeeded. Not only did she learn to start the machine, but she could also inspect and repair it. When she jumped on the tractor and drove away, she was extremely happy. The people followed closely behind her, shouting, "Look! A woman is driving a fire plow!"
    Graduated! She and the male students drove the tractors back to school through the wild ridges. The teachers and all the students warmly welcomed them.
    In the summer of 1948, the school prepared to start large-scale production and bought three new tractors. Liang Jun was even happier. She thought, "I can use my own skills to create my own garden." Under her influence, another female student, Wu Yuzhen, also wanted to learn tractor driving. This was a girl who looked very weak on the outside.
    The school chose a piece of land, more than thirty miles away from the county seat. It was a barren mountain ridge that no one had ever cultivated. There, the male students built a big shed. Liang Jun and Wu Yuzhen also built a shed, so small that it could only sleep two of them, and they had to bend over to crawl in. Everyone cooked outside and fetched water from the gully below. However, the hard life did not shake everyone's will in the slightest—they were all determined to build a new farmland on this wild ridge.
    Intense labor began. The tractors crawled over the weeds day and night, and the young men and women sang happily, fighting against nature.
    Liang Jun drove the tractor, and Wu Yuzhen followed behind to operate the plow. The two of them were responsible for one machine. The hot midday sun made the whole machine hot. Sweat kept flowing, and the clothes were immediately baked dry again. People felt like they were squatting in a steamer. Moisture and sweat caused Liang Jun to develop scabies all over her body. At this time, Liang Jun and her female partner still continued to work, moving forward like the male students. The opened new soil was increasing, and their confidence in victory was also increasing. During summer hoeing, they operated the machines day and night, only sleeping for four or five hours in the afternoon. She advanced alongside the male comrades.
    In order to popularize tractor technology, Liang Jun, like the other male students, had to train apprentices. She first spent more than a month teaching Wu Yuzhen, enabling her to independently master a machine. Then she trained male apprentices. Finally, even Wu Yuzhen began to train apprentices! During the entire land reclamation process, the entire school trained a total of eighteen tractor drivers, and Liang Jun and Wu Yuzhen trained half of them. This was the result of their patient and meticulous teaching.
    During the land reclamation, the machines never broke down, because everyone loved the machines as if they were their lives. In this regard, Liang Jun also did as well as others. Once, on a stormy night, she suddenly remembered that the magneto was still installed on the machine. If it got wet from the rain, the machine would be difficult to start the next day. Thinking of this, she climbed out of the shed, ran to the machine in the rain, and touched it. Sure enough, it was wet, so she removed it and brought it back.
    What power is supporting her? Listen to her own explanation.
    "We suffered so much in the past. Chairman Mao rescued us and gave us happiness. The People's Liberation Army is fighting for us. We must work hard to be worthy of Chairman Mao and the soldiers on the front lines."
    Now, Liang Jun has transformed from a simple little girl into a heroic warrior. She has honorably joined the New Democratic Youth League. She is a female tractor driver of New China, a model of new women.

    女拖拉机手梁军
    顾雷
    梁军今年二十一岁，生在黑龙江省德都县城的一个贫农家里，因为家穷，十三岁才进本县的小学读书，初小还没有毕业，就失学了。为了生活，她也曾给地主家薅草、补麻袋、冬天给人家打扫院子。解放以前，一直过着苦日子。
    一九四七年三月，人民政府在德都成立了萌芽乡师，五月间，她就决然离开家继续求学，她说：“当时只是想着再长点知识将来好挣饭吃，省得围着锅台转一辈子。”
    德都萌芽乡师，是同学们自己动手修筑起来的，是劳动和学习紧紧结合的新型学校。全体男女同学都积极参加劳动，学纺线、织布、开荒、种地，这些生活，梁军都非常熟悉，在校长教员的帮助下，在学习和劳动中，她逐渐了解共产党是一个怎样的党，自己应当怎样努力求学，争取未来的光明远景。
    一九四八年黑龙江中共省委开办了拖拉机训练班，学校决定派人去学习，梁军觉得这是个好机会，坚持着要去，于是就和两个男同学去北安了。
    去的时候，她非常愉快，但到了北安，却到处遇到困难，七十多个拖拉机学员中，只有她一个是女的。机师问她：“来干啥的？”梁军说：“来学开拖拉机的！”机师说：“回去吧！你不能开这个，太脏了！”男同学也在嘀咕：“女人还来学开火犁啦！”许多人都不赞成收女学员，认为女人不能干这个。幸亏校长支持把她留下了。
    整个学习过程中，校长不断地鼓励她，她自己也加倍努力。一次机师讲课的时候，她因为不懂机器，不敢伸手，唯恐作错了弄坏了东西，谁知机师却说她怕脏不想伸手，批评了她一顿。但她还是抱着满腔热诚坚持学下去。
    每次机师拆卸机器讲课的时候她都细心地听。一遍两遍的试验，不会的就问。并且跑到机器上面，钻到机器下面，来细心看，细心捉摸。天气冷，浑身冻的直抖，也不管，两个月中她胜利了，不但学会了开动机器，而且可以检查并修理了。当她跳上拖拉机开着跑的时候，她高兴极了。老百姓紧跟在她的后面，喊着：“看！女人开火犁了！”
    毕业了！她和男同学同样开着拖拉机，经过一道道的野岭回学校。老师和全体同学热烈的欢迎了他们。
    一九四八年夏天，学校准备开始大生产，买了三台新拖拉机。梁军于是更高兴，她想：“能够用自己的技术，创造自己的园地了。”在她的影响下，另一个女同学吴玉珍也要学拖拉机，这是一个从外表看来是很瘦弱的女孩子。
    学校选择了一块地，离县城三十多里路，是一座从没有人开过的荒山野岭，在那里男同学搭了一个大窝棚，梁军和吴玉珍也搭了一个窝棚，小得只能睡下她们两个人，弯着身子才能钻进去。大家在外面烧饭，到下面沟子里取水，但是，艰苦的生活并没有丝毫动摇大家的意志——他们都决心要从这个野岭上建立起新的田园。
    紧张的劳动开始了，拖拉机日夜不停的在野草上爬来爬去，男女青年愉快的唱着歌，和大自然作斗争。
    梁军开着拖拉机，吴玉珍跟着掌犁，两个人包下一台机器。晌午火热的太阳，照得整个机器是热的。汗不住的流，衣服湿了即刻又被烤干，人像蹲在蒸笼里一样。湿气和汗，使梁军长了满身疥疮，这时候梁军和她的女伙伴仍然照样干下去，和男同学一样的前进。开起的新的泥土在增加着，她们的胜利信心也在增加着。  夏锄的时候，白天黑夜开动机械，只在下午睡四五个钟头，她同样和男同志并肩前进。
    为了要普及拖拉机的技术，梁军和其他的男同学一样要带徒弟，她首先用一个多月时间教会了吴玉珍，使她能够单独的掌握一台机器，然后又带了男徒弟，最后，连吴玉珍也带起徒弟来了！整个开地过程中，全校一共带出了十八个拖拉机手，梁军和吴玉珍两个人带的就占一半。这是由于她们教得耐心、细致的结果。
    开地的时候，机器从来没有坏过，这是因为每个人爱机器如生命一样。在这方面，梁军也作得和别人一样好：有一次，在一个风雨交加的夜里，她突然想起了磁石发电机还在机器上装着，如果被雨淋湿了，第二天机器不好发动，想到这里便爬出窝棚，冒着雨跑到机器上一摸，果然湿了，便拆下拿了回来。
    这是什么力量在支持她呢？请听听她自己的说明吧。
    “我们过去受了那样多的痛苦，毛主席把我们救了出来，给我们幸福，人民解放军为我们打仗，我们要好好的干，才对的起毛主席和前方的战士。”
    现在，梁军已经由一个思想单纯的小姑娘，变成一位英勇的战士了。她已经光荣地参加了新民主主义青年团。她是新中国的女拖拉机手，新妇女的典型。                      （每日广播）
