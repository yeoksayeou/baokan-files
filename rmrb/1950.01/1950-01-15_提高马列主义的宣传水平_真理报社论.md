    Raise the Level of Marxist-Leninist Propaganda
    -- Truth Editorial
    On November 14, 1938, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) passed the "Resolution on How to Conduct Party Propaganda Work Due to the Publication of 'A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'." The resolution pointed out that the publication of "A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" was the greatest event in the ideological life of the Bolshevik Party. Comrade Stalin—the creator of the historical science of Bolshevism—gave the Party a new and powerful ideological weapon and an encyclopedia of basic knowledge in the field of Marxism-Leninism. "A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" narrates and summarizes the rich experience of the Communist Party, an experience that no party in the world, past or present, can match.
    Stalin's work, "A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," has become the most important means of arming Party members and Soviet intellectual cadres with the knowledge of social development laws and political struggle.
    The publication of "A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" put an end to arbitrary and chaotic, simplified and vulgar narratives and conclusions on many issues of Marxist-Leninist theory and Party history. The Party obtained unified leadership through the "A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," in which dialectical historical materialism and Leninism were combined as one, and historical materialism demonstrated its inseparable connection with the Party's policies. Stalin's work, "A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," demonstrated the inseparable unity, continuity, and inheritance of Marx's and Lenin's doctrines; at the same time, it explained the unity of Marxism-Leninism by incorporating the new elements brought into Marx's doctrines by Lenin and his students through summarizing the new experiences of the proletarian class struggle during the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. "A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" powerfully demonstrated the great mobilizing, organizing, and revolutionary role of Marxist-Leninist thought, proving the correctness and vitality of Marx's and Lenin's doctrines in practice.
    The publication of "A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" has significant international implications. Stalin's brilliant work of Party history, with the historical experience of the Lenin-Stalin Party and the ever-victorious experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, has armed and continues to arm the Communist Parties and workers' parties of all countries.
    Comrade Stalin's genius work on the history of the Communist Party promoted a new and powerful improvement in the Party's entire ideological work and our Marxist-Leninist propaganda work.
    In the resolution of November 14, 1938, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) put forward a broad program for rebuilding the Party's propaganda work regarding the current tasks of our cadres in mastering Bolshevism. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) instructed: "Without the knowledge of Marxist-Leninist theory, without mastering Bolshevism, without overcoming the backwardness of one's own theory, our cadres will have many shortcomings, because the task of correctly leading all sectors of socialist construction requires practical mastery of the foundations of Marxist-Leninist theory, and the ability to rely on theory to solve practical problems."
    In the historic report at the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Comrade Stalin specifically emphasized the task of educating our cadres with Marxism-Leninism.
    Comrade Stalin said: "It can be boldly said that if the cadres in all our work departments are ideologically built to such an extent, and politically trained to such an extent, that they can at any time recognize the domestic and international environment, if we can build them into fully mature Marxists-Leninists, enabling them to solve the problems of national leadership without making serious mistakes, then we have every reason to believe that nine-tenths of all our problems have been solved. And this task, we are absolutely capable of solving, because we have all the means and conditions necessary to solve this task."
    Following Comrade Stalin's instructions, in recent years, the Party has done a lot of work in arming our cadres with Bolshevism. Millions of Party and non-Party Bolsheviks independently study the history of the Party and the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. A large number of new theoretically qualified propaganda cadres who spread Marxist-Leninist ideas to the masses are constantly increasing. "A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" has become a book that all Communist Party members and Soviet intellectuals keep close at hand. Therefore, a network of Party schools at the republic, state, and regional levels has been established, as well as various study groups for leading Party, Soviet, and economic workers. The Higher Party School and the Academy of Social Sciences are affiliated to the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). In higher vocational schools, Marxist-Leninist theory is taught, and Marxist-Leninist night universities have been established.
    The solemn tasks of communist construction require further strengthening of Marxist-Leninist propaganda.
    The task of Party organizations is to constantly bring the ever-victorious thought of Lenin-Stalin to the masses. The resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the preparation for the new academic year in the Party's education system pointed out: In the Party's education cause, the most important task of Party organizations is to ensure that theoretically qualified propagandists lead all political schools and groups, improve the ideological and political level of coursework, and strengthen assistance to cadres who independently study Marxist-Leninist doctrines.
    Party organizations have done significant work in preparing for this academic year in the Party's education system. Training classes for propagandists in rural and urban areas, and leaders of tens of thousands of groups and political schools have been trained multiple times. A large number of secretaries from Party state committees, city committees, district committees, and grassroots Party organizations have been absorbed into the propaganda cause. The replenishment of groups and political schools has been carried out more precisely. In many Party organizations, the number of Communist Party members who independently study Marxism-Leninism has increased. The work of standing propagandist study groups has begun in a timely manner.
    However, there are still serious shortcomings in Party propaganda. Not all Party organs have reached the due level of organization in the Party's education system. In many places, the theoretical level of coursework in political schools and groups is often not high, and the necessary attention is not given to those who independently study Marxist-Leninist theory. Pskov, Voroshilovgrad, Kalinin, and some other states have these shortcomings.
    Leading Party members to study independently is of particular importance in the Party's education system. It is necessary to approach each Communist Party member individually, constantly monitor their progress in study, and provide assistance to those who answer questions. In order to help those who independently study Marxism-Leninism, it is necessary to systematically give speeches on the history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), speeches on the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, dialectical and historical materialism, political economy, the history of the Soviet Union, the domestic and foreign policies of the Party and the Soviet state, and other issues. Communist Party members who study independently should be the focus of constant attention from Party organizations.
    Publications play an important role in helping propagandists and Communist Party members study independently. Newspapers and magazines need to systematically publish articles, publish discussions on theoretical and methodological issues, and systematically clarify and summarize the experiences of propaganda work.
    Party propaganda work is an important and responsible part of the Party's work. The primary responsibility of every Party organization is to constantly lead Party propaganda, systematically inspect and supervise the work of the Party's education network, regularly discuss the issue of Communist Party members studying Marxism-Leninism, carefully listen to propagandists' reports on the political learning process, and take concrete measures to improve the Party education of members and alternate members of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks).
    Marxist-Leninist theory illuminates our path to new victories, inspiring the Soviet people's struggle for the great cause of communism. Our cadres must master Marxist-Leninist theory and arm themselves with the knowledge of the laws of social development in order to gloriously complete the historical tasks put forward by the Communist Party and our leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin.

### 提高马列主义的宣传水平——真理报社论

    提高马列主义的宣传水平
    ——真理报社论
    一九三八年十一月十四日，联共（布）中央委员会曾通过了“因《联共（布）党史简明教程》出版而应如何进行党的宣传工作的决议”。在这个决议中，曾指出了《联共（布）党史简明教程》的出版在布尔塞维克党的思想生活中是最大的事件。斯大林同志—布尔塞维主义科学的历史的创造者—给与党新的而强有力的思想武器和一部马列主义领域中基本知识的百科全书。在《联共（布）党史简明教程》中，叙述和总结了共产党的丰富经验，这种丰富的经验，在世界上不论过去或现在没有一个政党能与其匹敌的。
    斯大林的著作《联共（布）党史简明教程》，成为用社会发展法则和政治斗争的知识武装党员和苏维埃知识分子干部的最重要的手段。
    由于《联共（布）党史简明教程》的出版，结束了对马列主义理论和党史的许多问题的专断和混乱的、简化和卑陋的叙述和结论。党由于联共（布）党史得到了统一的领导，在这个领导中，辩证历史唯物论和列宁主义再结合为一，同时历史唯物论表现出与党的政策不可分离的联系。在斯大林的著作《联共（布）党史简明教程》中，表现出马克思与列宁学说的不可分离的统一性、连续性和继承性；同时，由列宁及其学生们用总结帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的无产阶级的阶级斗争的新经验所带入马克思学说中的新东西也说明了马列主义的统一性。《联共（布）党史简明教程》以巨大的力量表明了马列主义思想的伟大动员的、组织的和革新的作用，证明了马克思、列宁学说在实践中的正确性和生活力。
    《联共（布）党史简明教程》的出版，具有重大的国际意义。斯大林的这本著作，以列宁——斯大林的党的历史经验，以苏联社会主义建设的常胜经验，曾武装了和武装着所有国家的共产党和工人党。
    斯大林同志的共产党史的天才著作，促进了党的全部思想工作和我国马列主义宣传工作的新的而有力的提高。
    联共（布）中央委员会在一九三八年十一月十四日的决议中，关于我们干部掌握布尔塞维主义的当前任务，曾提出重建党的宣传工作的广泛纲领。联共（布）中央委员会曾指示：“没有马列主义理论的知识，没有掌握布尔塞维主义，没有克服自己理论的落后，我们的干部将会有很多缺点，因为正确的领导社会主义建设的所有部门的任务，要求实际掌握马列主义理论的基础，要求能依靠理论解决实际问题。”
    在联共（布）第十八次会议上的历史性报告中，斯大林同志曾特殊地强调以马列主义教育我们干部的任务。
    斯大林同志曾说过：“可以大胆地说：如果我们所有各工作部门中的干部人员在思想上造就到这样的程度，在政治上把他们锻炼到这样的程度，使得他们能够随时认清国内环境和国际环境，如果我们能把他们造成为十分成熟的马列主义者，使他们能够解决国家领导问题而不犯严重错误，那末我们就有一切根据，认为我们所有的问题十分之九已经解决了。而这个任务，我们是绝对能够解决的，因为我们有解决这个任务必需的一切手段和条件。”
    遵循着斯大林同志的指示，近几年来，党在以布尔塞维主义武装我们干部方面，做了许多工作。数百万党的和非党的布尔塞维克，独立地研究党史和马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作。以马列主义的思想传播到群众中去的许多新的有理论素养的宣传干部不断地增加着。《联共（布）党史简明教程》成为所有共产党员和苏维埃知识分子不离手头的一本书。因此，创设了共和国的、州的和边区的党校网，还创设了党的、苏维埃的和经济工作者领导人的各种讲习所。在联共（布）中央委员会下附设了高级党校和社会科学院。在高等专门学校里，进行马列主义理论的教授，创设了马列主义夜大学。
    共产主义建设的庄严的任务，是要求进一步加强马列主义的宣传。
    党组织的任务，在于把列宁——斯大林的常胜思想不停地带入群众之中。联共（布）中央委员会关于在党的教育体系中对新学年的准备决议中指出：在党的教育事业中，党的组织最重要的任务，是保证以有理论素养的宣传员来领导全部的政治学校和小组，提高课业的思想——政治水平和加强帮助独立地研究马列主义学说的干部。
    党组织对准备党的教育系统中的本学年，曾进行了重大工作。在乡村和城市中宣传员的训练班、数万小组和政治学校的领导者曾受过多次的训练。吸收大量的党的州委会、市委会、区委会和基层党组织的书记参加宣传事业。更精密地进行小组和政治学校的补充。在许多党的组织里，增多了独立研究马列主义的共产党员的数目。适时地开始常设的宣传员研究班的工作。
    但是，在党的宣传上还有严重的缺点。不是所有的党机关都达到党教育系统中应有的组织性。在许多地方，政治学校和小组的课业，其理论水平常常是不高的，对于独立研究马列主义理论的人，没有给与必须的注意。朴斯考夫、伏罗西洛夫格勒、加里宁和一些其他州都有这种缺点。
    在党的教育体系中，领导党员独立学习具有特殊重要的意义。需要个别的接近每个共产党员，需要经常地监督他们研究的进度，需要解答问题的人员对他们的帮助。为了帮助独立地学习马列主义的人们，必须有系统地作出联共（布）党史的演说，关于马列主义经典的著作、辩证唯物论与历史唯物论、政治经济学、苏联历史、党的和苏维埃国家的内外的政策等等问题的演说。独立学习的共产党员应当是党的组织经常注意的中心。
    出版物在帮助独立学习的宣传员和共产党员上扮演着重要角色，在报纸和杂志中，需要有系统地发表文章，发表关于理论与方法问题的讨论，有系统地阐明和总结宣传工作的经验。
    党的宣传工作，是党的工作中重要而负责的一部分。每个党的组织的首要责任在于：经常地领导党的宣传，有系统地检查和监督党的教育网的工作，定期讨论共产党员学习马列主义的问题，留心听取宣传员关于政治学习过程的报告，采取具体的方法来改善联共（布）党员和候补党员的党的教育。
    马列主义的理论，照明了我们步向新胜利之路，鼓舞着苏维埃人民争取共产主义的伟大事业的斗争。我们的干部，要掌握马列主义的理论，用社会发展法则的知识武装起来，才能光荣地完成共产党和我们的领袖与导师斯大林同志所提出的历史任务。
