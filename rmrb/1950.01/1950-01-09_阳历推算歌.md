Gregorian calendar is really convenient, everyone can calculate it,
A year has twelve months, three hundred and sixty-five days,
Big months have thirty-one days, small months have thirty days,
Before July, odd months are big, after August, odd months are reduced,
February has twenty-eight days, leap months add one day,
When does it start to be a leap year? Divide the Gregorian year by four.

    阳历推算歌
    阳历真方便，人人会推算
    一年十二月，三百六五天
    月大三十一，月小三十天
    七前单月大，八后单月减
    二月二十八，闰月加一天
    何时始逢闰，四除公历年
