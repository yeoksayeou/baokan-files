The Supreme Organ of State Power in the Soviet Union – The Supreme Soviet
Compiled by Jiang Hongju

I. The Powers of the Supreme Soviet

The Supreme Soviet is the supreme organ of state power in the Soviet Union. No organ of power in the Soviet Union has authority superior to or equal to the Supreme Soviet. The Supreme Soviet is elected every four years. The last election was held on February 10, 1946, and its term will expire in February of this year. According to Article 14 of the Soviet Constitution, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has the power to represent the Soviet Union in international relations, conclude treaties with foreign countries, and define the general scope of relations between the Union Republics and foreign countries; to decide on issues of war and peace; to accept Republics into the Soviet Union; to supervise the implementation of the Soviet Constitution and ensure that the Constitutions of the Union Republics conform to the Soviet Constitution; to approve changes in the borders of the Union Republics; to approve the national budget and final accounts; to safeguard national security, organize Soviet defenses, and direct the armed forces of the Soviet Union; to establish the basic principles for the organization of the armed forces of the Union Republics; to establish the principles of national economic planning and labor legislation; to establish the court system and procedures; to establish Soviet citizenship laws and laws on the rights of foreigners; and to issue all-Union amnesties and pardons.

In addition, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is the highest legislative body, with the power to enact all-Union laws and supervise their correct and unified application. This law is uniform throughout the Soviet Union, expressing the will of all the peoples, and is effective in the territories of all the Union Republics. All organs of power, organizations, civil servants, and citizens must comply with it.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has the right to organize investigations and inspections of any issue, and all organs and civil servants must comply with the requirements of these committees.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union elects the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, organizes the Soviet government – the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, appoints the Procurator-General, and leads and promotes the work of all departments of the country. It is the supreme leadership institution of all the people of the Soviet Union.

II. The Organization of the Supreme Soviet and its Electoral System

The Supreme Soviet is composed of two chambers: the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities. Because the Soviet Union is a multi-ethnic country, the various nationalities have common interests, which are represented by the Soviet of the Union. But each nationality also has its own special interests, which are represented by the Soviet of Nationalities. One representative to the Soviet of the Union of the Supreme Soviet is elected for every 300,000 Soviet citizens. This is calculated according to population, regardless of which Union Republic, Autonomous Republic, or National Autonomous Region it is. The Soviet of Nationalities is elected by Soviet citizens based on Union Republics, Autonomous Republics, Autonomous Provinces, and National Districts, with 25 representatives from each Union Republic, 11 from each Autonomous Republic, 5 from each Autonomous Province, and 1 from each National District. The term of office for representatives in both chambers is four years.

The powers of the two chambers are equal, and any proposal must be passed by a majority vote in both chambers to take effect. Each chamber has three standing committees: one each for legislation, budget, and foreign affairs. There are also special committees. Each Union Republic and Autonomous Republic has its own Supreme Soviet, but with only one chamber, i.e., without a Soviet of Nationalities. This is because the Autonomous Republics, Autonomous Regions, and National Districts within each Union Republic already have their representatives participating in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is elected on the basis of universal, equal, and direct suffrage, using secret ballots. All Soviet citizens who have reached the age of eighteen have the right to vote and stand for election, without any restrictions based on gender, nationality, ethnicity, religion, education level, place of residence, property status, origin, or past activities. Active military personnel also enjoy the right to vote. All workers' social organizations and groups have the right to nominate candidates for Soviet deputies, as do factory workers' congresses, army assemblies, collective farm and village peasant congresses, and state farm workers' unions.

Candidates for deputies to the Supreme Soviet must be nominated thirty days before the election and registered with the district election commission during this period. The commission should publish the names, ages, occupations, and nominating organizations of the candidates in the newspapers at least twenty days before the election to allow for discussion. But most importantly, the candidate must agree in writing to run in that electoral district. A candidate who receives an absolute majority, i.e., more than half of the total votes cast in the district, is considered elected.

According to the Soviet electoral law, elections to the Supreme Soviet are held on the same day throughout the Union, and the date must be announced two months in advance. The day of the election is usually a holiday, from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight, so that all voters can participate in the election.

III. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union

The joint session of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union elects the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, which exercises the powers of regular supervision and administration of the various organs and is responsible to the Supreme Soviet. The Presidium consists of a Chairman, sixteen Vice-Chairmen (one from each Union Republic), a Secretary-General, and fifteen members. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is the collective President of the Soviet Union. According to the Constitution, it has the power to supervise the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union; convene sessions of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; issue decrees; interpret Soviet law; dissolve the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and announce new elections in accordance with Article 47 of the Constitution; hold national referendums on its own initiative or at the request of a Union Republic; promulgate laws on general or partial mobilization; declare a state of war in the event of armed aggression against the Soviet Union or when it is necessary to fulfill obligations under international treaties for mutual defense against aggression during the recess of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; approve and abolish international treaties concluded by the Soviet Union; and appoint and remove Soviet plenipotentiary representatives abroad.

In bourgeois countries, these powers are held by a single body or president; whereas in the Soviet Union, they are exercised by a democratic, collective body representing all the Union Republics and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

Deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, while serving as deputies, continue to work in their original jobs, dedicating all their strength and knowledge to their work and the tasks they represent, in the interests of the people.

There is no country in the world where the connection between representatives and the people is as close and direct as it is in the Soviet Union. The representatives dedicate their entire lives to the people.

IV. The 1946 Elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union

In the elections to the Second Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in October 1946, a total of 1,339 deputies were elected, of whom 26 percent were workers, and 36 percent were clerks and intellectuals. Women accounted for 277 of the deputies. 293 of the deputies were between the ages of 23 and 35. Military personnel accounted for a large number of the deputies.

Elected as deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for the Stalin electoral district of Moscow were the great leader of the Soviet people, Stalin, and other prominent leaders of the Soviet state and the Communist Party – Molotov, Shvernik, Andreyev, Mikoyan, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Khrushchev, Beria, Malenkov, Voznesensky, Bulganin, Kosygin, etc.

Also elected as deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union were outstanding figures from among workers, peasants, and intellectuals, leaders of industry and collective farms, representatives of science and culture, and soldiers and generals of the Soviet Red Army.

For example, Marshal Kouf of the Soviet Union was a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. He was born in the village of Lodalovo in the Vologda province. During the First World War, he was a non-commissioned officer in the artillery. After the October Revolution, he joined the Red Army, and his life has been connected with it ever since. During the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945, Kouf's command talents were particularly brilliant. He successively commanded troops on various fronts, and his troops were the first to cross the Vistula River, sweep away the German bandits in Poland, storm Berlin, and liberate the Czech capital Prague. The residents of Prague therefore elected him as an honorary citizen of Prague.

Another deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Kovpak, was born in the Transcaucasus. He served as a soldier in the old Russian army in the past. During the Great Patriotic War, he was elected Chairman of the Soviet of Putivl in Ukraine. After the German bandits invaded the city, he went underground to organize guerrillas. Soon his exploits spread throughout the Ukrainian grasslands and the Bryansk forests. He led a guerrilla force equipped with mortars, anti-tank guns, and artillery, deep behind enemy lines, crossing the entire Ukraine, Belarus, and reaching the Carpathian Mountains, completing an unprecedented advance of 10,000 kilometers, destroying enemy manpower, disrupting transportation lines, and burning enemy warehouses.

Vavilov, one of the deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, is a famous Soviet scientist, a physicist who won the Stalin Prize, and is now the President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. During the Great Patriotic War, he actively participated in armed work; under his leadership, many complex optical instruments were created, making great contributions to the Soviet Navy and Army.

Voters in the Kirov district of Leningrad sent worker Titov of the Leningrad plant as a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. During the Soviet regime, Titov completed courses at the boiler and electrical machinery school while working. In 1932, he became the foreman of the machine shop. Under his leadership, this machine shop completed the manufacture of the first batch of heavy tanks. During the war, Titov continued to produce tanks for the Leningrad defenders under constant bombing; after part of the factory was moved to the Urals, he became one of the organizers of the production of the famous new type of tanks "K.V." and "E.S.".

In addition, those elected as deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union included: the famous female tractor driver and captain of the women's tractor team, Angelina; the advanced chairman of the Turkmen collective farm and former hired peasant, Aga Yusuf Ali; the female collective farmer of Azerbaijan and famous cotton planter, Basti Bagirova, who was originally the daughter of a hired peasant; and the Soviet hero and college student from the Komi region, Timofeev.

The best people in the Soviet Union manage the Soviet state, including Communists and non-party members, who have gained the trust of the masses in state and social affairs, in selfless work in factories, mines, and fields, in achievements in science, technology, and culture, and in the heroic struggle against the enemies of the Soviet motherland.

    苏联国家最高政权机关——最高苏维埃
    蒋洪举编译
    一、最高苏维埃的职权
    苏联最高政权机关是苏联最高苏维埃，在苏联没有任何一个政权机关在职权方面是超乎最高苏维埃或是和它相平等的。最高苏维埃，每四年选举一次，上届选举是在一九四六年二月十日举行的，到本年二月任期将满。按照苏联宪法第十四条的规定，苏联最高苏维埃有权代表苏联发生国际关系，与外国缔结条约，规定各加盟共和国与外国发生关系之一般范围；处决战争与和平问题；接受共和国加入苏联；监督苏联宪法遵行情形，保证加盟共和国宪法与苏联宪法之适合；批准各加盟共和国疆界之变更；批准国家预算及决算；保卫国家安全，组织苏联国防，指导苏联全国武装力量；规定加盟共和国军队编制的基本原则；规定国民经济计划及劳动立法原则；制定法院系统及诉讼程序；制定苏联国籍法；及外籍人权利法律；以及颁布全苏联大赦及特赦令之权。
    此外，苏联最高苏维埃是一个最高的立法机关，有权颁行全联盟的法律并监督其正确和统一的运用，这个法律在整个苏维埃联盟是统一的，是所有各民族人民意志的表现，在所有加盟共和国的领土上，都发生效力，所有的政权机关、团体、公务员及公民均须遵行。
    苏联最高苏维埃有组织调查及视察任何问题的权利，一切机关和公务人员必须执行这些委员会的要求。
    苏联最高苏维埃选举出苏联最高主席团和苏联最高法院，组织苏联政府——苏联部长会议，任命总检查长，领导并推动全国各部门工作。是苏联全体人民的最高领导机构。
    二、最高苏维埃的组织及其选举制度
    最高苏维埃是由联盟院与民族院两院组成的。由于苏联是多民族的国家，各民族具有共同的利益，代表这种共同利益的叫做联盟院。但各族人民还有他们每一民族的特殊利益，代表各民族特殊利益的叫做民族院。每三十万苏联公民，选一人为最高苏维埃联盟院的代表。这是按人口计算的，不问它是那一个加盟共和国或自治共和国或民族自治区等等。民族院由苏联公民按加盟共和国、自治共和国、自治省、民族州选出，计每加盟共和国二十五名，每一自治共和国十一名，每一自治省五名，每一民族州一名。两院代表任期均为四年。
    两院的职权是相等的，凡议案必经两院最大多数通过始生效力。每一院有三个常设委员会；分别处理立法、预算及外交方面的问题。另外还设有各特种委员会。在各加盟共和国及自治共和国都有自己的最高苏维埃，但只有一院，即没有民族院。这是因为在各加盟共和国内之自治共和国、自治区、民族区等，已有它们的代表参加苏联最高苏维埃了。
    苏联最高苏维埃是根据普遍、平等、直接的选举权，用秘密的投票法选出的。凡苏联公民年满十八岁的都享有选举和被选举权，不因性别、民族、和种族、信仰、教育程度、居住地域、财产状况、出身和过去活动的差异而有所限制。现役军人也同样享有选举权。各劳动者的社会组织和团体，都享有提出苏维埃代表候选人的权利，同时工厂里的职工大会，军队的集会、集体农场与乡村的农民大会，以及国营农场的职工会也都享有该项提名权。
    最高苏维埃代表候选人，要在选举前三十日提名，并在这个时期内，在区选举委员会驻册。委员会应于选举前至少二十日在报章上将候选人姓名、年岁、职业和提名的组织刊布出来，让大家讨论。但最重要的是：该候选人必须以书面同意在该选举区内竞选。候选人获得绝对多数，即在该区内获得总票数的过半数，认为当选。
    根据苏联选举法的规定，最高苏维埃的选举，在整个联盟内于同一日内举行，日期必须于两个月前公布。选举的那一天，照例是假日，自上午六时起至午夜十二时止，以便所有选民都能参加选举。
    三、苏联最高苏维埃主席团
    苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议选出苏联最高苏维埃主席团，执行经常监督和管理各机关的职权，对最高苏维埃负责。主席团设主席一人，副主席十六人（每个加盟共和国一人），秘书长一人，委员十五人。苏联最高苏维埃主席团是苏联的集体总统，按照宪法的规定，有权监督苏联部长会议，召集苏联最高苏维埃会议；颁布法令；解释苏联现行法律；依照宪法第四十七条规定，解散苏联最高苏维埃，并宣布实行新选举；自动或根据某一盟员共和国要求，举行全民公决；颁布全国总动员法或局部动员令；在苏联最高苏维埃休会期间，凡遇苏联遭受敌国武装侵犯时，或遇必须履行国际互防侵略条约义务时，得宣布战争状态；批准及废除苏联所订国际条约以及任免苏联驻外全权代表之权。
    在资产阶级国家，这些职权操于在单独一个机关或总统之手；而在苏联，则由民主的、集体的、代表一切盟员共和国和苏联最高苏维埃的机关来行使。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表，自己虽身为代表，但仍在自己的原来的工作岗位上工作，把一切力量和知识，贡献给自己的工作和自己所代表的任务，为人民谋利益。
    在世界上没有任何一个国家，能像苏联一样，代表和国民之间那样亲密地、直接地连系着。代表们自己的全部生命贡献给全体人民。
    四、一九四六年苏联最高苏维埃的选举
    一九四六年十月苏联第二届最高苏维埃的选举中，当选的代表共有一千三百三十九人，其中工人占百分之二十六，职员和知识分子占百分之三十六。在代表中妇女占二百七十七名。代表年龄在二十三至三十五岁者有二百九十三人。军人在代表中占很大数额。
    莫斯科市斯大林选区，当选为苏联最高苏维埃代表的是苏维埃人民的伟大领袖斯大林及苏维埃国家和共产党的其他著名领袖——莫洛托夫、什维尔尼克、安德烈耶夫、米高扬、卡冈诺维奇、伏罗希洛夫、赫鲁舍切夫、贝利亚、马林科夫、伏兹聂先斯基、布尔加宁、柯守庚等。
    当选为苏联最高苏维埃代表的还有工人、农民和知识分子中的杰出人物，有工业和集体农场的领导者，有科学和文化工作者代表，有苏联的红军战士和将帅。
    例如苏联元帅柯乌夫就是苏联最高苏维埃的一个代表。他出生于伏洛高德省的洛达洛村。第一次世界大战时，他是炮兵下士。十月革命以后，他加入红军，从此他的生命就和它连接在一起。在一九四一——一九四五年的卫国战争时期，柯乌夫的统率才能，表现得特别光辉。他曾经先后统率各线部队，他的部队首先强渡维斯杜拉河，扫荡波兰境内德寇，直捣柏林，解放捷克首都布拉格，布拉格居民因此就推他为布拉格的荣誉市民。
    还有一位苏联最高苏维埃代表柯夫帕克，诞生于外高加索。在过去旧俄军队里当过小兵。卫国战争时，他被推为乌克兰普季夫市苏维埃的主席。德寇侵入该市后，他就转入地下工作，组织游击队。不久他的功勋就遍传乌克兰的草原和勃梁斯克的森林。他率领配有迫击炮、反坦克炮和大炮的游击队，深入敌后，越过整个乌克兰、白俄罗斯，直达喀尔巴阡山，完成广达万公里的、空前未闻的大挺进，击毁敌人的有生力量，破坏交通线，焚毁敌人仓库。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表之一的瓦维洛夫，是一个著名的苏联科学家，曾得斯大林奖金的物理学家，现在是苏联科学院院长。在卫国战争时期他积极参加武装工作；在他的领导之下，创造了许多复杂的光学仪器，给苏联海陆军以极大的贡献。
    列宁格勒基洛夫区选民派遣列城工人季托夫为苏联最高苏维埃代表。在苏维埃政权时代，季托夫一面工作，一面修毕了锅炉电机学校的课程。一九三二年他成为机器间的领班。在他的领导之下，这个机器间完成了第一批重坦克的制造。战时在不断的轰炸下，季托夫继续为列宁格勒守城战士生产坦克；工厂一部分迁到乌拉尔之后，他就成为著名的新式战车“Ｋ·Ｖ·”和“Ｅ·Ｓ·”式的重坦克生产的组织者之一。
    此外，当选为苏联最高苏维埃代表的有：著名女曳引机手、妇女曳引机队队长安盖丽娜；先进的吐谷曼集体农场主席、过去的雇农阿迦·尤苏普·阿李；阿塞尔拜疆的女集体农民、著名的植棉能手巴斯季·巴吉罗娃，她原是一个雇农的女儿；柯米地方的苏联英雄、大学生季摩采夫等人。
    管理苏维埃国家的是人民中最优秀的人物，有共产党人，也有无党派人士，他们都在国家和社会事业上，在工厂、矿井和田地的忘我工作中，在科学、技术和文化方面的成就中，在跟苏维埃祖国敌人的英勇斗争中，获得人民群众的信任。
