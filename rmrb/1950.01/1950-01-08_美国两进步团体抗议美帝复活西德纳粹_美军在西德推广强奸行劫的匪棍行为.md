Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: TASS, New York, 5th: The chairman of the American Slavic Congress, Kritzky, and the general secretary, Pylinsky, have sent telegrams to Democratic Senators Pepper and Gillett, and Republican Senators Ives and Hendrickson, supporting their bill, proposed in the Senate last year, demanding an investigation into the abandonment of the denazification plan in the American occupation zone of Germany. They stated that millions of American Slavs across the United States are deeply shocked by the increasingly obvious revival of fascism in the American occupation zone of Germany. The chairman of the United Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, Barsky, also declared that the committee will hold a mass meeting in New York City on January 26 to protest the United States' failure to implement the denazification plan in Germany and to condemn the United States' attempt to aid Franco's Spain. Barsky emphasized that in West Germany, Nazis are regaining leadership of the war industry cartels, and anti-Semitism is also reviving.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: TASS, Moscow, 5th: Labor Daily published an article exposing the thuggish behavior of the American occupiers in West Germany. Recently, after the US High Commissioner for West Germany, McCloy, announced a new campaign to introduce American "culture" to Germany, American soldiers enthusiastically spread the "American way of life" everywhere. According to a report from the Electric News Agency, in Erlangen alone, 83 cases of rape and robbery by American soldiers occurred in two weeks. In the past six weeks, 14 cases occurred in Coburg, and 35 in Augsburg. The Berliner Zeitung reported that on New Year's Day, employees of the Nuremberg American occupation authorities stole four coats in the cloakroom of a restaurant. Two American soldiers killed a German waiter and injured a German. A recent pastime of American soldiers is to knock off the hats of passers-by while riding bicycles. Labor Daily stated that the "civilized" Americans have taken on the "great mission" of promoting the gangster life of modern America in Germany.
