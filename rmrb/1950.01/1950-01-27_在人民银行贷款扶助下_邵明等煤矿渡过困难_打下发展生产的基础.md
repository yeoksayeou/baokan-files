    With the People's Bank's Loan Assistance,
    Shao Ming and Other Coal Mines Overcome Difficulties
    and Lay the Foundation for Production Development
    [Our Newspaper's News] The Hebei Provincial Branch Business Department of the People's Bank, using the method of "real value loans," assisted the Shao Ming Village Coal Mine in Neiqiu County and the Zhang Village Coal Mine in Shahe County, enabling the two mines to continue production. The Neiqiu Shao Ming Mine has about one thousand workers and produces 250 tons of bituminous coal per day. However, in August and September of last year, 60% of the mine was flooded, and the daily coal output decreased to 100 tons. The mine was also in danger of collapse. The Shahe Zhang Village Mine has 1,500 workers and produces 300 tons of anthracite coal per day, but the mine lacked funds, so that during the period from July to September last year, the lives of the workers were also affected, and they almost stopped work. Upon the recommendation of the Hebei Provincial Industrial Company, the provincial branch business department, based on the principle of benefiting both parties, provided loan assistance in September last year, with a total loan of 63.6 million yuan, for a term of four months, converted to 2,400 tons of raw coal. The Shao Ming Mine used a loan of 30 million yuan to purchase two four-inch electric pumps and a machine part, installed a new drainage machine, eliminated the danger, and the output increased again to 250-260 tons. From November to the end of December last year, in one and a half months, it produced an additional 11,250 tons of bituminous coal. The Zhang Village Mine used a loan of 33.6 million yuan to pay the wages for the three months from July to September. After the lives of all employees were guaranteed, they never stopped work from October to December last year, and mined a total of 30,000 tons of coal. In this way, a timely loan guaranteed the safety of the coal mine and supported the continued production of the two mines; not only did it increase the production of 40,000 tons of coal, but it also laid a relatively solid foundation for the future development of the two mines.

    在人民银行贷款扶助下
    邵明等煤矿渡过困难
    打下发展生产的基础
    【本报讯】人民银行河北省分行营业部，用“折实放款”的办法，扶助内邱县邵明村和沙河县章村两个煤矿，使两矿能继续生产。内邱邵明矿有一千名左右工人，每天出产烟煤二百五十吨。但在去年八、九月间，矿井被水淹没十分之六，每天煤产量减少到一百吨，矿井还有塌陷的危险。沙河章村矿有工人一千五百名，每天出产无烟煤三百吨，但该矿资金极为缺乏，以致在去年七月到九月背月时期，职工生活亦发生问题，几乎陷于停工。经河北省实业公司的介绍，省分行营业部根据两利的原则，在去年九月予以贷款扶助，共放款六千三百六十万元，定期四个月，折原煤二千四百吨。邵明矿用贷款三千万元，买了两个四寸电泵和一部机器零件，安装了新的排水机，消除了危险，产量又重新增到二百五、六十吨；从去年十一月份到十二月底一个半月，共多生产了一万一千二百五十吨烟煤。章村矿用贷款三千三百六十万元，开支了七月到九月份三个月的工资，全体职工在保障了生活以后，从去年十月到十二月始终没有停工，共开采了三万吨煤。这样用一宗适时的放款，保障了煤矿的安全，扶持了两矿的继续生产；不但增产了四万吨煤，还给两矿今后的发展生产打下了比较稳固的基础。
