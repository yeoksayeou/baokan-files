    Red Star Newspaper Comments on Truman's "State of the Union" Address: Hypocritical Lies Cannot Deceive People
    Truman said: The great economic recession has been overcome, and the people's welfare has increased.
    The truth is: The economic recession is intensifying, development is slowing, unemployment has exceeded 14 million, and the people's lives are getting worse.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 9th] TASS, Moscow: A Red Star newspaper observer recently commented on Truman's "State of the Union" address to Congress, saying: This address is a mixture of hypocritical lies and vote-grabbing promises. It says that the first major post-war economic recession has been overcome and eliminated. But it is well known that new materials prove every day that this economic recession is intensifying and developing. Unemployment—the permanent companion of capitalism—is growing at a disastrous rate. In 1949, the number of unemployed people had more than doubled compared to 1948.
    The American president insisted that the welfare of most Americans had increased. But the simple figures in official reports completely refuted this lie. According to estimates by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the minimum annual living expenses for a typical American family of four in 1948 had already exceeded $3,000. And the income of more than half of American families was far below this amount. These materials do not include the unemployed and partially employed, whose total number has exceeded 14 million. Therefore, the living conditions of millions of Americans are getting worse and worse due to rising prices, reduced wages, and mass unemployment.
    Contrary to the actual state of the nation, the address said that there had been improvements in the housing problem for those with low incomes. But even Senator Douglas held a different opinion. He recently wrote in Collier's magazine that millions of Americans live in filthy, stinking slums, and the number of slums is increasing day by day.
    The observer pointed out that all these facts fully prove what kind of life Americans actually live, a life that the American president tries to describe as "paradise on earth," but which has nothing in common with "paradise on earth."
    The observer further wrote: The address is equally disregardful of the facts when it comes to American foreign policy. For example, Truman said: "We continue to successfully support the recovery of Europe." But the people of Marshall Plan countries who have received the "favors" of American monopoly capital have learned too much about the true value of this "support."
    Truman said: We continue to successfully support the recovery of Europe.
    The truth is: Production in Marshall Plan countries has been sharply reduced, the number of unemployed has soared, and the proponents of the Marshall Plan have already admitted to a miserable failure.
    The Western European countries, shackled by the dollar, are sinking deeper and deeper into the whirlpool of economic collapse. In order to please the Wall Street monopolists, the domestic production of all Marshall Plan countries is being reduced, the dollar shortage caused by the U.S. expansion policy is increasing, financial difficulties are becoming more serious, the living standards of the already impoverished working people are declining further, and unemployment is increasing day by day. Even the most enthusiastic advocates of the Marshall Plan have admitted its failure. Truman carefully mentioned the American monopoly capital's ambition to dominate the world, while hypocritically guaranteeing support for the United Nations, while the American ruling group is rudely violating the charter and principles of the United Nations. He hypocritically insisted that the implementation of concrete peace plans is the goal of American policy, while covering up the current mad arms race in the United States, the United States' expenditure of billions of dollars to supply weapons to its European and Asian vassals, the establishment of a worldwide network of bases, and the Cold War—in short, the overall aggressive measures taken by Wall Street in preparing for another world human slaughter.
    Truman paid lip service to "peace" while actually using three-quarters of the American budget to prepare for a war of aggression.
    The observer wrote: The address claims that the U.S. government intends to continue its previous policies. The plans proposed in the address show that American taxpayers' money will continue to be used for aggressive purposes. Truman warned against "attempts to drastically reduce the budget."
    As is well known, nearly three-quarters of the American budget is to be used for the arms race, preparing for new wars, and implementing Wall Street's adventurous policies aimed at seizing world hegemony.
    The observer concluded: Truman's vote-grabbing rhetoric cannot deceive anyone. The American president's apparently well-intentioned statements have been refuted by the facts, and the facts are stubborn.

### 红星报评杜鲁门“国情”咨文  虚伪谰调骗不了人

    红星报评杜鲁门“国情”咨文  虚伪谰调骗不了人
    杜鲁门说：经济大衰退已克服人民的福利增加了
    事实是：经济衰退加剧发展失业已逾千四百万人民生活越来越坏
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：红星报观察家顷评论杜鲁门致国会的“国情”咨文说：这个咨文乃是虚伪的谰调和笼络人心的诺言的混合物。它说战后经济活动的第一次大衰退已被克服和消除。但人所共知，新的材料每天都证明这种经济衰退在加剧和发展。失业——这个资本主义的永久的伴侣，正以灾难性的速率增长。在一九四九年，失业的数目已比一九四八年增加了一倍。
    美国总统硬说大部分美国人民的福利增加了。但是官方报告的简单数字，就完全驳倒了这种谰言。根据美国劳工统计局的估计，美国一般四口之家每年最低的生活费用，在一九四八年即已超过三千美元。而半数以上的美国家庭的收入，都远低于这个数目。这些材料还没有把失业和部分失业的人计算在内，这些人的总数已超过一千四百万。因此数以百万计的美国人的生活境况，由于物价不断上涨、工资减少和大批失业，正愈来愈坏。
    与实际的国情刚好相反，咨文说在收入低微者的居住问题上，已有了好转。但是甚至参议员道格拉斯也持有不同的意见。他最近在柯里尔杂志上著文称，数以百万计的美国人居住在污秽发臭的贫民窟里，贫民窟的数目正日益加多。
    观察家指出，所有这些事实都充分证明美国人实际上过着什么样的生活，美国总统力图把这种生活形容为“人间天堂”，可是这种生活与“人间天堂”毫无共同之处。
    观察家进一步写道：咨文在谈到美国外交政策的时候，同样不顾事实。譬如杜鲁门说：“我们继续成功地支持欧洲的复兴”。但是马歇尔化国家的受到美国垄断资本所施“恩惠”的人民，对这种“支持”的真实价值，已了解得太多了。
    杜鲁门说：我们继续成功地支持欧洲的复兴
    事实是：马歇尔化国家生产急剧削减失业人数激增马歇尔计划的鼓吹者已经招认惨败
    套着美元枷锁的西欧各国，正愈来愈深地沉没在经济崩溃的漩涡里。为了讨好华尔街的垄断资本家，所有马歇尔计划国家的本国生产都在削减，美国扩张政策所造成的美元荒，日益增加，财政困难日益严重，已经赤贫化的劳动人民的生活水平，更趋下降，失业日益增加。即使是马歇尔计划最热心的鼓吹者，也已承认它失败了。杜鲁门小心翼翼地提到美国垄断资本称霸世界的野心，同时伪善地保证支持联合国，而美国统治集团则正粗暴地违犯联合国的宪章和原则。他伪善地硬说具体和平计划的执行，乃是美国政策的目标，而对于现在美国实行的疯狂军备竞赛，美国开支数以十亿计的美元，以武器供给其欧洲和亚洲附庸，建立世界范围的基地网及冷战——总之，华尔街在准备另一次世界人类大屠杀时所采取的全盘侵略措施，则加以掩饰。
    杜鲁门口称“和平”实际上正在以美国预算的四分之三用于准备侵略战争
    观察家写道：咨文声称美国政府打算继续执行它以前的政策。咨文中提出的计划表明，美国纳税人的钱以后还要用在侵略的目的上。杜鲁门警告了“剧烈削减预算的妄图”。
    而如所周知，美国预算的几乎四分之三，要用在军备竞赛，准备新战争及执行华尔街的旨在夺取世界霸权的冒险政策方面。
    观察家结语说：杜鲁门的笼络人心的言辞，欺骗不了任何人。美国总统的表面上善意的声明，已为事实驳倒，而事实是顽强的。
