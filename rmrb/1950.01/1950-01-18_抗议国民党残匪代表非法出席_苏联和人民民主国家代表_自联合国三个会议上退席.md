These three meetings were held by the Economic and Social Council's Program Committee, the Subcommittee on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, and the Special Committee on Statelessness and Related Problems. At each of the three meetings, the Soviet delegation suggested expelling the representatives of the Kuomintang clique from the meeting.

    【新华社北京十七日电】塔斯社纽约十七日讯：一月十六日，苏联和人民民主国家的代表自联合国机构的三个会议上退席，抗议国民党集团代表非法出席。这三个会议是经济社会理事会的程序委员会、防止歧视与保护少数民族小组委员会、无国籍者及有关问题特别委员会所举行的会议。在三个会议中的每一个会议上，苏联代表团都建议从该会中开除国民党集团的代表。但三个会议上的主席都拒绝考虑苏联建议，因此苏联和人民民主国家的代表退出会场。
