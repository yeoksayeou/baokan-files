Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th – According to TASS, Stockholm: The Swedish Parliament convened its first session of 1950 on the 11th. All parties in Parliament released their policies for 1950 on the 10th.

The acting chairman of the Swedish Communist Party, Hagberg, stated in a speech at the Communist Party parliamentary group meeting that the current diplomatic course taken by Sweden is primarily to participate in imperialist military blocs and prepare to launch a war against the Soviet Union. Sweden's domestic policy is to suppress living standards, characterized by wage freezes, the suspension of social reforms, and the creation of conditions most favorable to capitalists.

Hagberg stated: "We need another policy that is in line with the interests of the broad masses of workers. The key point of the Communist Party parliamentary group's work is to call on and promote the working people to defend peace, national freedom, and democratic rights for the progress of social culture."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th – TASS, Helsinki, 11th: Pikola, the presidential candidate of the Finnish People's Democratic League, gave a speech to league members in Helsinki, stating: "The current Finnish government serves the interests of Finnish big capitalists. This government suppresses the labor movement, persecutes democratic newspapers, worsens the economic situation of the working people, and increases Finland's national debt, causing inflation and leaving more than 60,000 people unemployed. In foreign affairs, this government has worsened Soviet-Finnish relations. For the happiness and prosperity of our motherland, we must restore the Soviet Union's trust in our country." Pikola called on the Finnish working people to unanimously participate in the presidential election.

    主张发动劳动人民保卫和平民主  皮可拉号召芬人民参加选举
    【新华社北京十三日电】据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩讯：瑞典议会十一日召开一九五○年首次会议。议会各政党均于十日发表了一九五○年的政策。
    瑞典共产党代理主席哈格堡，在共产党议会党团会议上演说称：瑞典目前所采取的外交路线，主要是参加帝国主义军事集团，准备对苏联发动战争。瑞典的内政方针则为抑低生活水平，其特点是冻结工资，中止社会改革和创造最有利于资本家的条件。
    哈格堡称：“我们需要另一种与广大职工群众利益相符合的政策。共产党议会党团的工作要点，在于号召并推动劳动人民，为着社会文化的进步来保卫和平、民族自由与民主权利。”
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社赫尔辛基十一日讯：芬兰人民民主联盟总统候选人皮可拉，向赫尔辛基的盟员发表讲演称：“现在的芬兰政府服务于芬兰大资本家的利益。这个政府镇压劳工运动，迫害民主报纸，使劳动人民的经济状况恶化，并使芬兰国债日增，通货膨胀，六万多人失业。在外交方面，这个政府使芬苏关系恶化。为了我们祖国的幸福与繁荣，我们必须恢复苏联对我国的信任。”皮可拉号召芬兰劳动人民一致参加总统选举。
