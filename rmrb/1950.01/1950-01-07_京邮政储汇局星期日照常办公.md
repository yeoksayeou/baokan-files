    Beijing Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Open on Sundays as Usual
    [This newspaper dispatch] To facilitate the public, meet business needs, and enhance work efficiency, the Beijing Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will, starting in 1950, be open as usual on Sunday mornings and public holidays to handle the opening and payment of small remittances and telegraphic transfers. Savings deposits and withdrawals will not be handled during these times. All branches of the bureau will also implement this practice simultaneously.
