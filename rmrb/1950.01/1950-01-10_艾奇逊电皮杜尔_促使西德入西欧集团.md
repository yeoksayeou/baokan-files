Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th - TASS, Brussels, 5th: The Belgian newspaper "Front" published an article stating that Acheson, after attending the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference and returning to Washington, telegraphed Bidault, emphasizing that the French government must immediately promote "economic unification" in Europe, otherwise, the US government would consider abandoning the US-France economic agreement. The plan proposed by the United States stipulates the union of the Ruhr-Lorraine-Luxembourg, which is clearly to pull West Germany into the Western European group to compete with the British steel industry. US investment in this union may be partially in the form of loans to France.

Front continued: French Foreign Minister Schuman and Acheson have reached a "gentleman's agreement" on the Near East issue. The United States and France will take joint action against British activities in the Near East, preparing to unite Syria and Iraq, and merge the Arab part of Palestine into Transjordan.

    艾奇逊电皮杜尔
    促使西德入西欧集团
    【新华社北京九日电】据塔斯社布鲁塞尔五日讯，比利时前线报刊载论文称：参加巴黎外长会议的艾奇逊，在返华盛顿后曾致电皮杜尔，强调法国政府必须立即促成欧洲“经济统一”，否则美国政府将考虑废弃美法经济协定。在美国所提出的计划中，规定了鲁尔——洛林——卢森堡的联合，这显然是把西德拉入西欧集团，与英国的钢工业相颉颃。美国在这一联合中的投资，可能部分地以对法贷款的方式进行。
    前线报继称：法外长舒曼和艾奇逊已就近东问题订立了“君子协定”。美法将采取联合行动对抗英国在近东的活动，准备使叙利亚和伊拉克相联合，并把巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯部分合并于外约旦。
