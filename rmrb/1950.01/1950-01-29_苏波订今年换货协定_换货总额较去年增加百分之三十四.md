Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 28th: TASS reports: The Soviet Union and Poland signed a trade agreement in Moscow on the 25th for the exchange of goods in 1950. The total value of the exchange increased by 34% compared to 1949. This is a large increase compared to the annual trade level stipulated in the five-year agreement of January 26, 1948.

The 1950 trade agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union will supply Poland with cotton, iron, manganese, chromium and other mineral seedlings, as well as automobiles, tractors, agricultural machinery, printing presses, petroleum products, chemicals and food; Poland will supply the Soviet Union with coal, railway cars, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, textiles and sugar.

The Polish People's Forum newspaper published an article on the 25th commemorating the second anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Polish five-year trade agreement and the Soviet loan agreement for Polish industrial equipment, stating that these two agreements are of great importance to the further development of Poland's national economy. They reflect the Soviet Union's brotherly assistance to the People's Poland, which is embarking on a new and epoch-making path, and also reflect the new economic relations between our two peoples. The newspaper emphasized that without the industrial equipment loaned to Poland by the Soviet Union, the rapid development of Poland's metallurgical industry would not have been possible.

    苏波订今年换货协定
    换货总额较去年增加百分之三十四
    【新华社北京二十八日电】据塔斯社讯：苏联与波兰已于二十五日在莫斯科签订一九五○年换货协定。换货总额较一九四九年增加百分之三十四。这比一九四八年一月二十六日五年协定中所规定的每年换货水平，大为增加。
    一九五○年换货协定规定苏联供给波兰棉花、铁、锰、铬等矿苗，以及汽车、拖拉机、农业机器、印刷机、石油产品、化学品与食品等；波兰供给苏联煤、火车车皮、含铁金属与非铁金属、纺织品与食糖等。
    波兰人民论坛报二十五日撰文纪念苏波贸易五年协定和苏联贷与波兰工业设备协定缔结的两周年称：这两个协定对波兰国民经济的进一步发展具有巨大的重要意义。它们反映出苏联对于正走在新的、划时代道路上的人民波兰的兄弟般援助，也反映出我们两国人民间的新经济关系。该报强调称：没有苏联贷予波兰的工业设备，波兰冶金工业的迅速发展是不可能的。
