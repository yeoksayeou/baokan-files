Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 29th: A frontline reporter reports on the People's Liberation Army's entry into southern Yunnan from western Guangxi to annihilate two corps of Kuomintang remnant bandits, stating: After General Lu Han led his troops in uprising, the bandit Eighth Corps and Twenty-sixth Corps, unrepentant, continued to oppose the people, entrenched themselves in eastern Yunnan, and vainly attempted to advance on Kunming. Our People's Liberation Army swiftly advanced westward along the Yunnan-Guangxi Road to extinguish this bandit army. After our army successively occupied Zhaoyi and Qujing from December 23rd to 25th, the stubborn bandits, suffering losses, fled south to the Kaiyuan, Mengzi, and Gejiu line, vainly attempting to escape into Vietnam along the Dian-Vietnam Railway. When the defeated enemy was only four hundred li from the Sino-Vietnamese border, parts of our Second Field Army and Fourth Field Army in Guangxi province, a thousand li away from the bandits, were ordered to swiftly advance westward from the Nanning and Baise areas to intercept the bandit army.

　　The southern PLA force swiftly advanced southwest from Baise on December 27th and, on the 11th of this month, together with the Yunnan-Guangxi-Guizhou Border Column, occupied Hekou, an important town on the Sino-Vietnamese border. On the 14th, they fiercely attacked the Hong River coast, seized the pontoon bridge that the enemy vanguard had just erected, and liberated Pingbian County on the same day, cutting off the bandit army's land escape route. Helpless, the bandit army, from the 12th onwards, airlifted part of the Twenty-sixth Corps' direct unit and their families from Mengzi Airport. Bandit chiefs Li Mi and Yu Chengwan also took the opportunity to flee in panic.

　　The northern PLA force advanced west from the Baise area on the 4th of this month, traveling day and night, crossing towering mountains and enduring extreme fatigue. After ten consecutive days of rapid march, covering more than 1,400 li, they arrived in the Mengzi area on the 14th, bypassing the enemy's blocking force sent to the Mingjiu area east of Mengzi. At 2:00 AM on the 16th, they swiftly occupied Mengzi Airport without the enemy's knowledge, capturing two enemy planes that had not yet taken off. On the same day, they also liberated Mengzi County, eliminating most of the enemy's 193rd Division, and closing the bandit's aerial escape route. The remaining enemy then hastily took trains west to escape. Our army pursued closely, liberating Gejiu County, a famous tin-producing area, on the morning of the 17th, eliminating most of the enemy's 161st Division, and liberating Jianhsui and Shiping on the 19th and 20th.

　　At this time, the southern PLA force was also moving upstream along the Yuan River, overcoming the many obstacles of the Hengduan Mountains, to block the enemy head-on. A part of the Guizhou-Yunnan-Guangxi Border Column, which persisted in fighting heroically behind enemy lines in the southwest, also rushed from northern Yunnan to the Yuan River Xinping area, day and night, setting up an inescapable net for the remaining enemy. During this period, we successively forced the enemy's Third Division to surrender, annihilated the remnants of the Twenty-sixth Corps in the Manhao and Kafang areas, and annihilated the remnants of the enemy's 237th Division south of Gejiu, capturing more than 2,000 people below the rank of deputy division commander. On the 22nd, our northern force finally intercepted the remaining bandit troops attempting to flee to Vietnam northeast of the Yuan River. On that day, they annihilated a total of more than 2,000 enemy troops, including the 170th Division of the Eighth Corps. After our follow-up troops arrived, they immediately joined the battle, carrying out a pincer attack from the east and west. After two days of fierce fighting, the entire enemy Eighth Corps headquarters and remnants of the 42nd Division were annihilated, killing more than 3,000 people and capturing more than 5,000 bandits, including Tang Yao, deputy commander of the bandit army headquarters, and Cao Tiange, commander of the Eighth Corps. By this point, all the fleeing enemy in southern Yunnan had been wiped out.

　　During this pursuit and annihilation campaign, our commanders and fighters demonstrated a high degree of class consciousness and a fine style of hard work, enduring fatigue that ordinary people could not endure, and advancing bravely. The various forces participating in this campaign were all units that had just participated in the pursuit and annihilation of the Bai bandit forces on the border of Guangdong and Guangxi, and had marched more than a thousand li without rest. After being ordered to advance westward, each unit advanced at a pace of more than one hundred li per day. In the final battle to annihilate the remaining enemy, the entire Northern Route Army bivouacked in the high mountains, and only ate one meal during the two days of fierce fighting. This meal was made by slaughtering the horses captured from the bandit army to satisfy their hunger. Because the people in the newly liberated areas of Fumin, Guangnan, Yanshan, Wenshan and other counties in southeastern Yunnan, and parts of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guizhou were poor and houses were scarce, our Southern Route Army endured the winter cold and bivouacked on the high mountains as an entire division. However, our entire army was inspired by the enthusiasm to defend the motherland and always maintained high morale. The residents of the counties of Fumin, Guangnan, Yanshan, and Wenshan in southeastern Yunnan, and some newly liberated areas of Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guizhou, were mostly ethnic minorities such as Miao, Yao, and Luo. When the troops arrived, each village slaughtered pigs and sheep, and organized dance teams to welcome our army from dozens of miles away; and organized mule and horse teams to help our army transport supplies, reducing many difficulties in the march. After the Yunnan-Guangxi-Guizhou Border Column joined forces with the main force, it actively cooperated in combat, building bridges, repairing roads, transporting grain, and chopping firewood for the army day and night. All of this gave the entire army unlimited encouragement and strengthened the entire army's will to annihilate the enemy.

    奉命歼残匪疾驰滇南
    逃敌两个军迅速复灭
    前线记者报道进军滇南歼匪经过
    【新华社西南前线二十九日电】前线记者报道人民解放军由桂西进入滇南歼灭国民党残匪两个军的经过称：卢汉将军率部起义后，匪第八军及二十六军不知悔悟，继续与人民为敌，窜踞滇东，妄图进窥昆明。我解放贵州大军遂沿滇桂路向西猛进，以扑灭该部匪军。去年十二月二十三日至二十五日我军连占沾益、曲靖等城之后，该部顽匪即负创南逃至开远、蒙自、个旧一线，妄图沿滇越铁路逃入越南。当败敌距中越边境仅四百余里时，距离该部匪军尚有千余里的桂境我第二野战军与第四野战军各一部，由南宁、百色地区奉命迅速分路西进，以截击该部匪军。解放军南路部队于去年十二月二十七日由百色向西南疾驰，于本月十一日协同滇桂黔边纵队进占滇越国界上的重镇河口，十四日更猛扑红河沿岸，将敌先头部队刚刚架起的浮桥占领，且于同日解放屏边县城，切断了匪军陆上逃路。匪军无奈，自十二日起，即由蒙自飞机场空运二十六军军直属队一部及眷属等逃走，匪首李弥、余程万亦乘机仓皇逃跑。解放军北路大军于本月四日自百色地区西进，日夜兼程，翻越丛山峻岭，忍受极度疲劳，连续十日，急行一千四百余里，十四日进抵蒙自地区，绕过敌匪派往蒙自以东鸣鹫一带的堵击部队。十六日晨二时即于敌不知不觉间神迅占领蒙自飞机场，俘获未及起飞的敌机两架，同日又解放蒙自县城，歼敌一九三师大部，关闭了匪空中逃路。残敌于是急乘火车西逃，我军跟踪穷追，于十七日晨解放著名锡矿产地个旧县城，歼敌一六一师大部，并于十九日及二十日解放建水、石屏两城。此时解放军南路军亦溯元江而上，排除横断山脉重重障碍，向敌迎头拦击；而坚持西南敌后，英勇作战的黔滇桂边纵队一部亦自滇北不分昼夜远道奔赴元江新平地区，给残敌布下天罗地网。于此期间我曾先后迫使敌第三师投降，在蛮耗、卡房地区歼灭二十六军残部，在个旧以南歼敌二三七师残部，俘副师长以下二千余名。二十二日我北路部队终于在元江东北截住企图逃往越南的残余匪军，是日即歼敌第八军一七○师等共两千余名。我军后续部队赶到后，随即加入战斗，实行东西夹击。经两日激战，全歼敌第八军军部及四十二师等残部，击毙三千余人，活捉匪陆军总部副总司令汤尧、第八军军长曹天戈以下五千余人。至此，滇南逃敌全部就歼。
    在此次追歼战役中，我军指战员表现出高度的阶级觉悟和艰苦奋斗的优良作风，忍受了常人所不能忍受的疲劳，奋勇前进。参与此次战役之各路大军均系刚刚参加了粤桂边境追歼白匪的作战，行军千余里而未曾休息的部队。各部奉命西进后，即又每日以百里以上的急行军兼程前进。在最后歼灭残敌战斗中，北路军全军更在高山峻岭露营，两日激战中仅吃了一顿饭，这顿饭也是以杀食缴获匪军之马匹充饥。南路我军因国防线上人民贫困，房屋稀少，曾整师忍受冬夜风寒在高山上露营。但我全军上下均为保卫祖国的热情所鼓舞，始终保持着高昂的士气。我军途经滇东南的富宁、广南、砚山、文山等县及部分滇桂黔新解放地区，居民多为苗、徭、倮等少数民族，部队到时各村杀猪宰羊，组织舞蹈队到数十里外迎接我军；并组织骡马大队帮助我军运输，减少了在行军中的许多困难，滇桂黔边纵队与主力会师后积极配合作战，并不分昼夜给大军架桥、修路、运粮、砍柴，这都给了全军上下以无限的鼓舞，加强了全军歼灭敌人的战斗意志。
