    Beijing Municipal Consultative Committee Second Meeting
    Fair Distribution of Public Bonds
    Representatives From All Sectors Unanimously Pledge Enthusiastic Subscription
    Beijing's Administrative Guidelines for This Year: Focus First on Developing Production
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee held its second plenary session yesterday (the 10th) to discuss two important issues: how to distribute and promote the first phase of the 1950 People's Victory Indexed Bonds, and the Beijing Municipal Government's administrative guidelines for 1950. Regarding the distribution and promotion of public bonds, all agreed that, in accordance with the spirit of the State Council of the Central People's Government's instructions and the actual situation in Beijing, 1.7 million shares should be allocated to industrial and commercial businesses, and 700,000 shares to local figures, wealthy households, and retired civil and military officials (the above should be allocated through fair and reasonable means); the remaining shares would be available for free subscription by all sectors, without specifying exact numbers. The method of promoting public bonds would take into account ease of payment, adopting a method of one-time subscription, installment payments, and completion on schedule; the Municipal Promotion Committee, under the leadership of the Municipal Government, would organize branch committees in various sectors to carry out the promotion. The meeting was presided over by Peng Zhen, Chairman of the Consultative Committee. After Vice Mayor Wu Han reported on the organization of the Beijing Municipal People's Victory Indexed Bond Promotion Committee, everyone expressed their opinions on the issue of promoting public bonds. Fu Huating, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, rose to speak, representing the city's industrial and commercial sector, expressing complete acceptance of this task and hoping that all sectors would provide assistance in many ways. Qian Duansheng, representing educators in Beijing on behalf of the Joint Committee of Faculty and Staff of Colleges and Universities, said: "I believe that educators in Beijing's universities, middle schools, and primary schools will certainly be able to voluntarily subscribe to a considerable number of shares without any form of coercion." After Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Director, gave a supplementary report on the current status of public bond subscriptions from all sectors in Beijing, Professor Fei Qing of Peking University said excitedly: "The staff of the Municipal Government are working very hard, but they have already subscribed to 20,000 shares. This time, the promotion of public bonds in Beijing will definitely be completed and exceed the target." He hoped that students could use the winter vacation to carry out appropriate publicity work. Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the North China Military Region, reported on the enthusiastic subscription of public bonds by commanders and fighters of the troops, saying: "The soldiers only have six jin of millet subsidy per month, and their lives are very hard, but many soldiers are still willing to take out several months' worth of their entire subsidy to subscribe to public bonds. Although we try to avoid challenges and competitions, each unit is still above 1,000 shares, and a certain division has already subscribed to more than 2,700 shares." Tian Lun of the Joint Committee of Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff, Chen Mingde of the press, Xu Beihong of the Beijing Academy of Art and other members spoke successively, unanimously believing that the government's issuance of public bonds was very appropriate, and that Beijing, as the people's capital, must strive to complete and exceed the target. After He Fengting, Chairman of the Trade Union of the Changxindian Railway Factory, and Song Fengxiang, Chairman of the Beijing Postal Workers' Union, reported on the enthusiastic situation of Beijing's workers subscribing to public bonds, Chairman Peng Zhen made a concluding speech. He first pointed out that the number and proportion of public bond allocations proposed by the Beijing Municipal Government are in line with the principles of the State Council's instructions, mainly for subscription by the industrial and commercial sector, wealthy households, and wealthy retired civil and military officials, followed by voluntary subscriptions by teachers, staff, and workers. He said that the subscription in the industrial and commercial sector and wealthy households must pay attention to the principle of fairness and reasonability, and the subscription among teachers, staff, and workers must pay attention to the principle of voluntary subscription. As for the soldiers in the army, who only have a few kilograms of rice allowance per month, and whose lives are already very hard because production has not yet developed, their spirit of subscribing is very moving and worthy of admiration, but they should not be forced to subscribe. It must also be noted that some students who are extremely economically disadvantaged and some workers and peddlers who are living in extreme poverty and are really unable to purchase public bonds should not be forced. It was also unanimously agreed at this meeting that the issuance of public bonds has great significance for stabilizing finance and prices, and for guaranteeing the development of industry and commerce and the stability of people's lives. It was pointed out that it was issued by the People's Government in a state of national victory and is fundamentally different from the public bonds issued by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past. The government is able to repay the principal and interest on schedule. This point should be fully explained to the people of all walks of life, so that they can fully understand it. Only in this way can this task be completed quickly and smoothly.
    After the discussion of the public bond issue ended, the meeting began to discuss the Beijing Municipal Government's administrative guidelines for 1950. First, Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu reported on the preliminary plan of the Municipal Government's administrative guidelines for 1950, and explained the proposed budget for developing production, cultural education, and municipal construction. He pointed out that the Municipal Government's administrative guidelines for 1950 are first to develop production, second to develop cultural education, and third to carry out municipal construction. Then, Chairman Peng Zhen explained: "Developing production should be the overriding central task of Beijing in 1950. Only by developing production can we thoroughly solve and improve the people's lives, and can we have the strength to carry out large-scale cultural education construction work and municipal construction work." He hoped that everyone would fully exchange opinions and start discussions. Zhang Yunchuan of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Liang Sicheng, Vice Chairman of the Consultative Committee, Yu Xinqing, Yan Jingqing, member of the Beijing Municipal Government and Director of the Health Bureau, Gu Qizong of the Beijing Municipal Student Union, and others spoke successively, all expressing unanimous agreement with this guideline and providing many suggestions. The specific work guidelines and arrangements for this year, as well as the budget distribution principles and detailed budget, will be discussed at the next Consultative Committee meeting, and will finally be submitted to the second session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference for discussion and approval.

    京市协商委员会二次会议
    公平分配推销公债
    各界代表一致保证踊跃认购
    京市今年施政方针  首先是发展生产
    【北京讯】北京市各界人民代表会议协商委员会昨（十）日举行第二次全体委员会议，讨论一九五○年度第一期人民胜利折实公债如何分配、推销及市政府一九五○年度施政方针两个重要问题。关于公债的分配与推销问题，全体同意根据中央人民政府政务院指示的精神及京市实际情况，分配工商业户一百七十万分；地方人士、殷实富户及退职文武官吏七十万分（以上均采取公平合理办法分配）；余下的分数由各界自由认购，不分配具体数字。公债推销方法，为照顾交纳方便，采取一次认购、分次交纳、按期完成的方法；并交由市政府领导的市推销委员会组织各界分会，进行推销。会议由协商委员会主席彭真主持。吴晗副市长报告京市人民胜利折实公债推销委员会组织经过后，大家对推销公债问题纷纷发表意见。工商业联合会筹委会主任委员傅华亭起立发言，代表全市工商业界表示完全接受这个任务，并希望各界从多方面予以协助。院校教职员联合会钱端升代表北京市的教育工作者说：相信北京市大、中、小学校的教育工作者，一定能够自动地、不取任何强迫的方式认购相当大的数目字。在程宏毅副主任补充报告京市公债推销各界认购的现况后，北大教授费青很兴奋地说：市政府工作人员很艰苦，但现已认购了二万分，这次京市公债推销一定能够完成并超过任务。他希望学生能利用寒假进行适当的宣传工作。华北军区政治部副主任张致祥在会上报告了部队指战员踊跃认购的情形，他说：战士们一月只六斤小米的津贴费，生活很苦，仍然有许多战士愿意拿出数个月的全部津贴，认购公债，虽然尽量避免挑战、竞赛方式，每个单位仍在一千分以上，某师且已认购了二千七百多分。中小学教职员联合会田伦、新闻界陈铭德、北京艺术专科学校徐悲鸿等委员相继发言，一致认为政府发行公债十分得当，而北京作为人民的首都，一定要争取完成并超过任务。长辛店铁路工厂工会主任何凤亭、北京邮政工会主任宋凤祥两委员报告了京市职工认购公债的热烈情形后，彭真主席作总结发言，他首先指出：北京市政府所提出公债分配数目和比例，是合乎政务院指示的原则的，主要是由工商业界、殷实富户及富有的退职文武官吏认购。其次由教职员、机关工作人员和工人自愿认购。他说在工商界和殷实富户中的认购必须注意公平合理的原则，在教职员、工人和机关工作人员中的认购必须注意自愿认购的原则，至于部队中战士每月只有几斤米的零用钱，目前生产又尚未发展起来，生活已经很苦，他们纷纷认购的精神是十分动人和值得钦敬的，但不要勉强认购，还有一部分经济极困难的学生和一部分生活极困难的工人、小贩实在无力购买公债者也必须注意不要勉强。又在此次会议中大家一致认为此次公债的发行对于稳定金融、物价，对于保证工商业发展和人民生活之安定有巨大意义，并指出它是人民政府在国家胜利的情况下发行的，它与过去国民党反动派发行的公债根本不同，政府是能够按期归还本息的。此点应向各界人民进行充分解释，使之充分了解，只有这样才能迅速顺利完成此任务。
    公债问题讨论结束后，会议开始进行讨论北京市政府一九五○年度施政方针。首由张友渔副市长报告了市政府一九五○年度施政方针的初步计划，并就发展生产、文化教育及市政建设各方面拟定中的预算分别作了说明。他指出市政府在一九五○年度的施政方针首先是发展生产，其次是发展文化教育，再次是市政建设。继由彭真主席说明：发展生产应该是一九五○年北京市压倒一切的中心工作，只有发展生产，才能彻底解决和改善人民的生活，才能有力量进行大规模的文化教育建设工作和市政建设工作，希望大家充分交换意见展开讨论。相继发言的有：中国农工民主党张云川，有协商委员会副主席梁思成，余心清，有北京市政府委员兼卫生局长严镜清、北京市学生联合会古奇踪等，都对这个方针表示一致赞同，提供了许多意见。关于本年具体工作方针和布置及预算支配原则和详细预算，将于下次协商委员会讨论，最后将提交本市第二届各界人民代表会议第二次会议讨论通过。
