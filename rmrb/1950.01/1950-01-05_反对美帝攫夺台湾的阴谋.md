Oppose the American Imperialist Conspiracy to Seize Taiwan

The American government and the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang have entered into a secret agreement, using weapons and dollar aid to assist the remaining bandits in exchange for complete military, political, and economic control of Taiwan. Its purpose is to prevent the liberation of Taiwan and turn Taiwan into a military base for aggression against the Chinese mainland and opposition to the people of the Far East. This criminal conspiracy once again exposes the ferocious face of American imperialism's determination to continue to be enemies with the Chinese people. Although the American government's policy toward China has completely failed, and the Kuomintang bandit gang it supports has been completely destroyed on the Chinese mainland, they are still determined to interfere in China's internal affairs, and they will use the remaining bandits as long as they have a soldier or a lair. And although the Kuomintang bandit gang has become a roving gang, they will sell every piece of land under their feet to the United States, and willingly be driven by American imperialism to resist and sabotage the Chinese people. Therefore, only by completely expelling the aggressive forces of American imperialism and eliminating the Kuomintang remnants can the Chinese people be completely liberated.

Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory, and the Chinese people will never allow the bandit gang to occupy it for a long time, nor will they allow any imperialist aggression. American imperialism vainly attempts to control Taiwan by aiding the remaining bandits, and to threaten the Chinese people by strengthening the Western Pacific Fleet, thereby hindering the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Taiwan. But since the Chinese people have been able to drive the forces of American imperialism out of the entire Chinese mainland, they also have the power to liberate Taiwan.

In the past nearly four years of war, American imperialism equipped the Kuomintang reactionaries with more than thirty American-equipped divisions, aided the bandit gang with more than 4 billion U.S. dollars in military supplies and more than 100 large and small warships, and dispatched a large number of military advisers to personally command the bandit army to attack the Chinese people. As a result, under the attack of the heroic People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang bandit gang was wiped out from the Chinese mainland, and a large number of American equipment and materials fell into the hands of the People's Liberation Army. So, in today's People's Liberation Army, which is ten to a hundred times stronger, what role can these few warships and hundreds of millions of dollars of supplies play?

Moreover, the people of Taiwan today are not the people of 55 years ago when Japan occupied Taiwan. Even during the Japanese occupation, the people of Taiwan held dozens of armed resistance movements. And since Taiwan returned to the motherland, the people of Taiwan have carried out heroic struggles against the enslavement rule of imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang bandit gang. In these struggles, the people of Taiwan have clearly realized the necessity of striving for liberation and have developed the strength to struggle. They will never allow American imperialism to enslave them again. If American imperialism dares to invade Taiwan and hinder the military operations of the People's Liberation Army, it will be met with a head-on blow from the Chinese people.

American imperialism regards Taiwan as an important link in its Pacific forward military base, and attempts to build a so-called "defense line" on Chinese territory. American imperialism knows that it cannot find any reason to directly occupy Taiwan, so some schemers have come up with the whimsical idea of preparing to occupy it under the pretext of UN trusteeship. But the Chinese people will never allow piracy under any name. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and sovereignty over Taiwan already belongs to China. There is no doubt about this legally or factually. The UN has no right to put Taiwan under trusteeship, just as the UN has no right to put Paris under trusteeship. The Chinese people fully understand how to defend their territorial sovereignty. If American imperialism puts on a farce of requesting the UN to take over Taiwan, it will not gain anything except further exposing its imperialist ferocity in front of the people of the world, especially the people of the East.

The American imperialist conspiracy to continue to aid the remaining bandits in Taiwan with military supplies and dollars, and to seize sovereignty over Taiwan, helpfully educates the Chinese people: American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, are the deadly enemies of the Chinese people. They are constantly scheming to oppose the Chinese people and attempt to seize the fruits of victory of the Chinese people. Therefore, when we consider international and domestic issues, we must not forget this immediate enemy for a moment. We must step up our support for the front lines, help the People's Liberation Army complete its combat preparations, liberate Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet as soon as possible, eliminate all imperialist bases of aggression in China, and crush the conspiracy of Chinese and foreign reactionaries to restore their counter-revolutionary rule.

### 反对美帝攫夺台湾的阴谋

    反对美帝攫夺台湾的阴谋
    美国政府与国民党残余匪帮订立秘密协议，以武器和美元援助残匪，换取对台湾的全部军事、政治和经济的控制权，其目的是在阻止台湾的解放，将台湾变成侵略中国大陆和反对远东人民的军事基地。这一罪恶阴谋，再一次地暴露了美帝国主义决心继续与中国人民为敌的凶恶面目。尽管美国政府的对华政策已经完全失败，他们所支持的国民党匪帮在中国大陆上已经全部覆灭，但他们仍然决心干涉中国内政，只要残匪还有一兵一卒，一巢一穴，他们一定要加以利用。而国民党匪帮尽管已经成为流寇，但只要脚下还有一块土地，都要把它出卖给美国，并甘心供美帝国主义的驱策，对中国人民进行顽抗和捣乱。所以，只有彻底驱逐美帝国主义的侵略势力，肃清国民党残匪，中国人民才能得到完全解放。
    台湾是中国领土的一部分，中国人民决不容许匪帮长期盘据，也不容许任何帝国主义侵略。美帝国主义妄图以通过对残匪的援助来控制台湾，以加强西太平洋舰队来威胁中国人民，阻碍人民解放军对于台湾的解放。但中国人民既然能把美帝国主义势力从整个中国大陆赶出去，也就有力量解放台湾。
    在过去将近四年的战争中，美帝国主义曾经装备了国民党反动派三十多个美械化师，援助了匪帮四十余亿美元的军事物资及百余艘大小舰艇，并派遣大批军事顾问亲赴前线指挥匪军进攻中国人民。结果，在英勇的人民解放军打击下，国民党匪帮被从中国大陆上扫荡殆尽，大批的美国装备和物资都落入人民解放军手里。那末，在人民解放军已经十百倍强大的今天，这区区几艘军舰和一亿几千万美元的物资又能起什么作用呢？
    而且，今天的台湾人民，也不是五十五年前日本占领台湾时候的人民了。即使在日本占领期间，台湾人民也曾举行过几十次武装反抗。而自从台湾重回祖国版图以后，台湾人民曾经进行了反对帝国主义及其走狗国民党匪帮奴役统治的英勇斗争。在这些斗争中，台湾人民已经清楚地认识到争取解放的必要，已经锻炼出斗争的力量。他们决不会再让美帝国主义来奴役他们。如果美帝国主义竟敢侵略台湾，妨碍人民解放军的军事行动，就将遭到中国人民的迎头痛击。
    美帝国主义把台湾当作是其太平洋前哨军事基地的重要环节，企图把所谓“防线”建立到中国领土上来。美帝国主义明知找不到任何理由来直接侵占台湾，便有一部分阴谋家异想天开，准备借口由联合国托管，而加以占领。但中国人民决不容许无论在什么名义之下的海盗行为。台湾是中国的领土，台湾的主权已经属于中国，无论在法律上在事实上都没有丝毫疑问。联合国之无权托管台湾，犹如联合国之无权托管巴黎一样明显。中国人民已经充分地懂得如何保卫自己的领土主权，美帝国主义如果演出请求联合国代管台湾的把戏，除了在全世界尤其是东方人民面前进一步地暴露其帝国主义的凶恶面目以外，决不会得到任何收获。
    美帝国主义继续以军火、美元援助台湾残匪，妄图攫取台湾主权的阴谋，很有益地教育中国人民：美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派是中国人民的死敌，它们无时无刻不在处心积虑地反对中国人民，企图夺取中国人民的胜利果实。因此，当我们考虑国际国内问题时，决不要有一刻钟忘记这一当面的敌人。我们要加紧支援前线，帮助人民解放军完成作战准备，早日解放台湾、海南岛、西藏，消灭一切帝国主义在中国的侵略基地，粉碎中外反动派的复辟其反革命统治的阴谋。
