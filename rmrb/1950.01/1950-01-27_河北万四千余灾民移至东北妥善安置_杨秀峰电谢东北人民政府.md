Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th -- Under the joint leadership of the Northeast and Hebei Provincial People's Governments, the task of relocating over 14,500 disaster-stricken people from Hebei Province to the Northeast was successfully completed by the end of last year. During the relocation process, the Hebei Provincial People's Government established a relocation office in Lutai and set up reception stations at Baoding, Yangcun, Changli, and Shanhaiguan stations to handle the transportation and reception of the disaster victims. Meanwhile, the People's Governments of severely affected areas such as Anxin, Baodi, and Ninghe also organized immigration committees to patiently mobilize and organize the relocation of severely affected areas that had suffered from perennial disasters or were unable to restore production within two or three years after the disaster. At the beginning of the relocation, the Hebei Provincial Government convened a joint meeting of civil affairs section chiefs from the relocation counties to discuss and arrange specific details. Propaganda and mobilization were carried out through people's representative conferences at all levels, explaining the principles that "the Northeast has vast land and sparse population, and abundant resources," "Governments led by the Communist Party care for the people everywhere," and "Farmers all over the world are one family, and there are people to help everywhere. As long as you work, you will have food to eat." This broke down the localism of "it's hard to leave a poor home, and hard to leave the hot soil" or the idea of "winter going and spring returning" that existed among the disaster victims. The property left behind by the general disaster victims was properly handled by entrusting it to relatives and friends for safekeeping or by fair purchase by cooperatives.

   During the relocation, in addition to each district sending cadres to lead the way, the government subsidized each person with three kilograms of millet per day for living expenses and transportation costs. Medical personnel were also set up along the way to provide medical treatment for the disaster victims. The disaster victims were warmly welcomed and cared for by the governments and people along the way when they entered the Northeast. After the disaster victims arrived in Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and other places, the local people's governments immediately resettled them in a prepared manner. A disaster victim from Wuqing wrote to his hometown saying: Each person was allocated ten mu (one qing) of land, each group (five to ten households) was given six draft horses, a new-style plow, and a production fund was issued. Disaster victims who moved to Hua County, Songjiang Province, wrote in a letter: As soon as we arrived at the station, the people who sent carts to greet us asked us warmly and helped us carry our luggage and hold our children. After arriving in the village, the locals had already prepared heated brick beds and firewood. From the letters written by the disaster victims to the Hebei Provincial Government and their fellow villagers, it was learned that the local masses enthusiastically donated clothing and food so that the disaster victims could quickly start production.

   For this reason, Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, sent a telegram to the Northeast People's Government and the people of Heilongjiang, expressing his gratitude.

    河北万四千余灾民移至东北妥善安置
    杨秀峰电谢东北人民政府
    【新华社北京二十六日电】在东北和河北两地人民政府协同领导下，河北省向东北迁移一万四千五百余灾民的任务，已于去年年底胜利完成。在移民过程中，河北省人民政府曾在芦台设立移民办事处，在保定、杨村、昌黎、山海关等车站分设招待站，办理灾民运送招待等工作。同时，安新、宝坻、宁河等重灾区人民政府，亦组织了移民委员会，耐心发动组织常年受灾或灾后二、三年内不能恢复生产的重灾区迁移。在移民开始时，河北省政府曾召开了移民县份民政科长联席会议，作了具体讨论与布置，通过各界人民代表会进行宣传动员，说明“东北地广人稀，物产丰富”、“凡共产党领导的政府到处都是一样关心人民”、“天下农民是一家，到处都有人帮助，只要劳动就有饭吃”等道理，打破了灾民中存在着的“穷家难舍，热土难离”的乡土观念，或“冬去春回”的思想。一般灾民所留的财产，均用托亲友代管或由合作社公平收买等办法，予以适当处理。
    在迁移中，除每区派有干部率领外，并由政府资助每人每日生活费三斤小米及车费开支。沿途并设有医务人员为灾民医疗疾病。灾民进入东北境内，更受到沿途政府及人民的热烈欢迎与照顾。当灾民到达黑龙江、松江等地后，当地人民政府均有准备地立即予以安置。武清一位灾民给家乡写信说：每人分配给土地十亩（一垧），每组（五至十户）给六匹耕马，一张新式耕犁，并发给生产基金。移到松江省桦县的灾民来信说：刚一到车站，派大车迎接的人们便向我们问寒问暖，帮助背行李、抱小孩。到村后，当地早就准备好炕席与烧柴。从灾民写给河北省府和乡亲们的信中得知，当地群众热烈捐助衣粮，使灾民们很快能够进行生产。
    为此，河北省人民政府杨秀峰主席，特致电东北人民政府及黑龙江各界人民，表示谢忱。
