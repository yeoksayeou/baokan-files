    Stalin and Party Newspaper Work
    By Li Shu
    Stalin, Lenin's most loyal student, was, like Lenin, a brilliant creator of Bolshevik party newspaper work. They both used party newspapers as weapons to consolidate the party's organization and expand the party's influence among the masses. When Lenin published the first Bolshevik newspaper, "Iskra," in December 1900, Stalin was a young Marxist in Tiflis, South Caucasus. The publication of Lenin's "Iskra" had a significant impact on Stalin. In a speech "On Lenin," Stalin recalled: "When I learned of Lenin's revolutionary activities in the late 1890s, especially after the publication of "Iskra" in 1901, I already believed that Lenin was an extraordinary figure. At that time, it seemed to me that he was not an ordinary leader of our party, but the actual creator of our party, because he alone understood the internal essence and urgent needs of our party."
    Just as the "League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class" led by Lenin in St. Petersburg was a model for the work of the revolutionary social democrats in Tiflis, nine months after the publication of "Iskra," in September 1901, when the revolutionary movement was constantly rising, Stalin and his close comrade Kezekhoveli initiated and founded the "Struggle" newspaper, which faithfully supported the propositions of "Iskra." "Struggle" was the first Social Democratic newspaper secretly published in Georgian. It promoted the ideas of Lenin's "Iskra" and declared war on all opportunist ideas. Apart from "Iskra," "Struggle" was the best Marxist newspaper in Russia at that time.
    Stalin published an editorial titled "From the Editors" in the first issue of "Struggle," defining the task of "Struggle" as: "The newspaper of the Georgian Social Democrats should give clear answers to all questions related to the workers' movement, should explain various principles, theoretically explain the role of the working class in the struggle, and illuminate every phenomenon encountered by the workers with the light of scientific socialism."
    In the same society, Stalin pointed out that the newspaper should lead the workers' movement, get as close as possible to the working masses in order to constantly influence them, and become their conscious leading center.
    Stalin was arrested in Batum on April 5, 1902. In February 1904, after he escaped from his place of exile in Irkutsk, Eastern Siberia, he led the Bolsheviks in the Caucasus in assisting Lenin in the struggle against Menshevism. In this struggle, the most powerful weapon Stalin used was the party publication. At that time, almost all Bolshevik publications in the Caucasus were organized and initiated by Stalin. He expanded the work of publishing secret books, newspapers, pamphlets, and leaflets to an unprecedented scale in the Tsarist era. From the beginning of 1904 to April 1906, the Afoulabal secret printing house in Tiflis published Lenin's "The Revolutionary Democratic Dictatorship of the Proletariat and the Peasantry" and "To the Rural Poor," Stalin's "Briefly on Disagreements in the Party" and "Two Clashes," as well as the party program and constitution, and dozens of leaflets, most of which were written by Stalin. Here, "Proletarian Struggle Newspaper" and "Proletarian Struggle Small Newspaper" were also published. All these books, pamphlets, newspapers, and leaflets were published in Russian, Georgian, and Armenian.
    The organ of the Caucasus League Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, "Proletarian Struggle Newspaper," published under the leadership of Stalin, was the successor to "Struggle." It played a decisive role in defending the Bolshevik position and promoting and developing Lenin's ideas in the Caucasus. Apart from the central party newspaper "Proletarian" edited by Lenin, "Proletarian Struggle Newspaper" was the best and largest Bolshevik newspaper. Almost every issue of "Proletarian Struggle Newspaper" reprinted articles published by Lenin in "Proletarian." Many important articles in "Proletarian Struggle Newspaper" were written by Stalin. In these articles, Stalin demonstrated his brilliant talent as a theorist. He correctly exposed the false ideas of various anti-Bolshevik factions and groups, and exposed their opportunism and betrayal. His attacks on the enemy were very accurate. Lenin praised "Proletarian Struggle Newspaper" exceedingly, praised its Marxist firmness, and praised its high literary value.
    After the failure of the armed uprising in December 1905, the struggle between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks became more intense. Anarcho-syndicalists also came out to operate, and they were especially noisy in Tiflis. Stalin resolutely defended the Bolshevik revolutionary line and became the central figure in the struggle against all anti-proletarian factions in the South Caucasus. In April 1906, the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party convened its Fourth Congress in Stockholm. After the end of this congress, Stalin returned to work in the South Caucasus. He led the Bolsheviks to publicly publish a series of newspapers in Georgian in Tiflis: "New Life Newspaper" in June-July 1906; after "New Life Newspaper" was closed, "New Era Newspaper" was published in December 1906 and January 1907; after "New Era Newspaper" was closed, "Our Life Newspaper" was published from February 18 to March 6 of the same year; after "Our Life Newspaper" was closed, "Era Newspaper" was published from March 11 to April 15 of the same year.
    Using this series of party newspapers as weapons, Stalin waged a resolute struggle against Menshevism and anarchism. Stalin published a systematic and brilliant series of articles under the general title "Anarchism or Socialism." In these articles, Stalin explained in plain language what materialism and dialectics are, and what historical materialism is. He very profoundly raised and solved the fundamental problems of Marxist-Leninist theory, namely, the inevitability of socialist revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the absolute necessity of a new type of combat proletarian party that is fundamentally different from the old-style parties of the Second International, while also explaining the foundations of Bolshevik strategy and tactics.
    In April and May 1907, the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party convened its Fifth Congress in London. After the meeting, Stalin returned to Russia and was ordered to lead the workers' movement in Baku. At this time, Russia was in the dark night of the rampant Stolypin reaction. However, the Baku period in Stalin's revolutionary activities was a period in which Bolshevism achieved complete victory in the Baku organization. Stalin organized the struggle to exclude all Mensheviks from the various workers' districts of Baku (Balakhany, Bibi-Heybat, Black City, White City). He presided over the Bolshevik-published secret and public newspapers "Baku Proletarian," "The Siren," and "Baku Worker." In the heroic struggle of the Baku workers, the public newspapers he founded issued loud calls.
    On March 25, 1908, Stalin was arrested. After nearly eight months of imprisonment, he was exiled to Vologda for a term of two years. But on June 24, 1909, he escaped back to Baku and continued to engage in secret work. During this period, Stalin published several "Caucasian Correspondence" of great historical significance in the central party publications; in the "Baku Proletarian" newspaper, Stalin published "The Crisis in the Party and Our Tasks," "Party Life," and many other articles.
    From March 1910 to September 1911, Stalin was arrested twice in Baku and St. Petersburg and exiled to Vologda twice. In January 1912, the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party convened a party conference in Prague, established a central organ (Russian Central Bureau) that actually led the Russian revolutionary work, and passed a resolution to establish "Pravda." Stalin was elected to the Central Committee by the conference in his absence due to his arrest. According to Lenin's proposal, it was decided that Stalin would preside over the Russian Central Bureau. After receiving Lenin's notice, Stalin escaped back to St. Petersburg on February 29, 1912. In the extremely short period of time that followed, Stalin carried out many major tasks, one of the great events of which was the publication of "Pravda," which laid the foundation for the victory of 1917.
    "Pravda" was founded by Stalin in accordance with Lenin's instructions. The first issue of "Pravda" was compiled under Stalin's guidance. Stalin decided that the direction of "Pravda" should be in line with the interests of the masses and the workers. However, on the first day of "Pravda's" publication, May 5, 1912, Stalin was arrested on the streets of St. Petersburg. After several months of imprisonment, Stalin was exiled to the more remote Narim region. But on September 1, 1912, Stalin escaped from the place of exile again to St. Petersburg. The Party Central Committee immediately sent him to lead the work of "Pravda" and "Zvezda" and the Fourth State Duma election campaign. At that time, Lenin had already moved from Paris to Krakow, because it was closer to St. Petersburg and convenient for leading "Pravda" and the growing domestic workers' movement. Lenin could receive "Pravda" sent from St. Petersburg within three days, and he maintained close contact with "Pravda" through the editorial secretary Molotov. But even so, the work of "Pravda" still made Lenin feel anxious from time to time. In order to avoid censorship, the editorial department of "Pravda" gave up the struggle against the liquidationists. Lenin's article "On the Election Program" was not published because the editor thought that "the tone of anger was obstructive." Stalin's being sent back to "Pravda" was to help "Pravda" implement the correct party line. After Stalin participated in the work, Molotov happily reported to Lenin about Stalin's work situation, saying: "You must already know that some changes have taken place in the editorial department that you will be happy with." Lenin established close contact with Stalin. Stalin's activities, speeches, and articles were fully approved by Lenin. When Lenin read Stalin's article on the election summary in the St. Petersburg workers' electoral group, "Who Won," he notified the editorial department of his opinion on this article, saying: "I cannot but congratulate you on the editorial in the 146th issue." The result of the Fourth State Duma election campaign was the victory of the Bolshevik Party. The "Letter of Entrustment Given by the St. Petersburg Workers to the Elected Representatives" written by Stalin played a great role here. Lenin deeply appreciated this "Letter of Entrustment." When he handed over the "Letter of Entrustment" for printing, he added the following note: "Be sure to take the original back after printing!! Do not stain it. It is extremely important to save this document." In a letter to the editorial department, Lenin instructed: "Be sure to publish this Letter of Entrustment to the St. Petersburg representatives in the most prominent space in large print." During this period, Stalin visited Lenin in Krakow twice and participated in joint meetings of the Central Committee and party workers. During Stalin's period abroad, the various old problems of "Pravda" recurred. Lenin believed that the editorial department must be transformed and an editor with rich experience in party work must be sent there. Lenin discussed in detail with Stalin the issue of reorganizing the leadership of "Pravda" and planned to carry out the reorganization immediately after Stalin returned to China. But Stalin was arrested soon after he returned to China. By the beginning of 1914, Stalin was exiled to the village of Kuleika, very close to the Arctic Circle. He spent 1914, 1915, and 1916 here. This was considered the most painful political exile in the most remote Siberia. During this period, in the summer of 1914, the imperialist world war broke out. On March 8, 1917, Stalin endured all kinds of hardships and returned to Petrograd, the revolutionary capital of Russia, and was once again entrusted by the Party Central Committee to lead the work of "Pravda."
    After "Pravda" was founded in 1912, it was under the persecution of the Tsarist police. The police closed "Pravda" eight times in two and a half years, but "Pravda," with the assistance of the workers, continued to publish under a new similar name such as "Supporting the Truth," "The Road to Truth," "Labor Truth," etc. When the imperialist war broke out in 1914, it was finally closed for good. After being suspended for almost three years, "Pravda" was复刊 on March 18, 1917, and regained the leadership of its founder, Stalin. At that time, Lenin was still living abroad, and the bourgeois provisional government used various means to prevent Lenin from returning to China. In this complex and arduous period, only Stalin constantly wrote articles in "Pravda" to instruct the work of Bolshevik party members, calling on the people to carry out revolution and establish a people's revolutionary regime - the Soviet.
    On the night of April 16, 1917, after a long period of exile, Lenin returned to Petrograd from abroad. This was a very sharp period of struggle between the Bolsheviks and the bourgeois provisional government. In a demonstration on July 16, the Mensheviks and Socialists, together with the bourgeoisie and White Guard generals, carried out a bloody suppression of the demonstrating workers and soldiers, and smashed the editorial department of "Pravda" and closed "Pravda," "Soldiers' Pravda," and many other Bolshevik newspapers. Lenin had to hide temporarily due to the slander and persecution of the counter-revolutionary provisional government, and was escorted to Finland by his closest comrade, Stalin. After this period, Stalin directly led the Party Central Committee and successively published the central organ of the party under various names such as "Worker and Soldier," "Proletarian," "Worker," and "Worker's Road." Stalin often published indicative articles in the party newspaper, guiding the struggle of Bolsheviks across the country. The last type of central party newspaper in this period, "Worker's Road," made a glorious publication struggle on the eve of the October Revolution. On November 6, on the eve of the Bolshevik armed uprising, the bourgeois provisional government led by Kerensky attempted to preemptively extinguish the Bolshevik armed uprising. It ordered an attack on the Smolny Palace, where the headquarters of the armed uprising was located, and on the morning of the same day, sent armored vehicles to surround the editorial department and printing house of "Worker's Road," and seized "Worker's Road." Stalin ordered the armored vehicles to be repelled and ensured the publication of the newspaper. Red Guards and soldiers carried out this order. At 11:00 a.m., "Worker's Road" was published. The newspaper published an editorial written by Stalin, "What We Need," calling on the masses to overthrow the provisional government. Large teams of revolutionary soldiers and Red Guards were transferred to the vicinity of the Smolny Palace in accordance with the orders of the party's central organ. The uprising began. "Pravda," the central organ of the party which had been published under various different names, announced to the world the news of the success of the great October Socialist Revolution on the second day of the uprising (November 7).
    The history of Lenin and Stalin's party newspaper work is inseparable from the history of the Bolshevik party building. Lenin used newspapers as a powerful weapon for propaganda, agitation, and organization of the masses. In his revolutionary struggle, Stalin faithfully implemented Lenin's instruction. He was always the actual leader and editor of the party newspaper work. Like Lenin, he often paid attention to every detail of the party newspaper work. He made the party newspaper a guide for the Bolsheviks to guide the masses while also being a newspaper of the masses themselves, and "Pravda" is a typical example created by Lenin and Stalin for party newspaper work.

    斯大林与党报工作
    黎澍
    列宁的最忠诚的学生斯大林，和列宁一样，是布尔塞维克党报工作的辉煌的创造者。他们都以党报为巩固党的组织和扩大党在群众中影响的武器。列宁在一九○○年十二月出版第一个布尔塞维克报纸《火星报》的时候，斯大林是南高加索梯弗里斯城一个青年马克思主义者。列宁《火星报》的出版，给予斯大林以重大的影响。斯大林在《论列宁》的一篇演说中回忆说：“当我知道列宁在十九世纪九十年代末，特别是在一九○一年以后，在《火星报》出版以后的革命活动时，我就已经相信，列宁是一个非常的人物。当时在我看来，他不是我们党的一个普通领导者，而是我们党的实际创造人，因为只有他一人才了解了我们党的内部实质和迫切需要。”
    正如列宁在彼得堡领导的“为工人阶级解放斗争协会”是梯弗里斯革命社会民主党人进行工作的模范一样，在《火星报》出版九个月以后，在革命运动不断高涨的一九○一年九月，斯大林和他早年的亲密的同志克泽霍越里发起创办了忠实支持《火星报》主张的《斗争报》。《斗争报》是第一个用格鲁吉亚文秘密出版的社会民主党报纸。它宣传列宁《火星报》的思想，向机会主义的全部思想宣战。除《火星报》以外，《斗争报》便是当时俄国最好的马克思主义报纸了。
    斯大林在《斗争报》第一期发表以“编者的话”为题的社论，确定《斗争报》的任务说：“格鲁吉亚社会民主党人的报纸，应当对一切有关工人运动的问题给予明确回答，应当说明各个原则问题，从理论上说明工人阶级在斗争中的作用，并用科学社会主义的光芒来照明工人所遇到的每一种现象。”
    在同一社会中，斯大林指出，报纸应当领导工人运动，尽量接近工人群众，以便经常影响他们，成为他们的自觉的领导中心。
    一九○二年四月五日斯大林在巴土姆被捕。一九○四年二月他从西伯利亚东部的依尔库茨克流放所逃回高加索以后，他就领导高加索的布尔塞维克协助列宁进行了反孟塞维主义的斗争。在这个斗争中，斯大林所运用的最强有力的武器便是党的刊物。当时高加索所有一切布尔塞维克的出版物，几乎全是由斯大林所组织和发起的。他把出版秘密书籍、报纸、小册子以及传单的工作，扩大到了沙皇时代空前未有的规模。从一九○四年初至一九○六年四月，在梯弗里斯的阿福拉巴尔秘密印刷所出版的有列宁所著的“工农革命民主专政”和“告农村贫民书”，有斯大林所著的“略论党内意见分歧”和“两次搏战”等，有党纲和党章以及大部分是斯大林写作的几十种传单。在这里，还出版了《无产阶级斗争报》和《无产阶级斗争小报》。所有这些书籍、小册子、报纸和传单，都是用俄文、格鲁吉亚文和阿尔美尼亚文三种文字出版的。
    俄国社会民主工党高加索联盟委员会斯大林领导下出版的机关报《无产阶级斗争报》，是《斗争报》的继承者。它对高加索一带捍卫布尔塞维主义立场，宣传和发挥列宁思想的事业，是起了决定作用的。除列宁所主编的中央党报《无产者报》以外，《无产阶级斗争报》就是最好的和最大的布尔塞维克报纸了。《无产阶级斗争报》几乎每一期都转载有列宁发表在《无产者报》上的论文。《无产阶级斗争报》的许多重要论文，都是斯大林写的。斯大林在这些论文中，发挥了他的理论家的灿烂的天才，他正确地揭破了各个反布尔塞维克派别和集团的虚伪思想，暴露了它们的机会主义和背叛行为。他对敌人所进行的攻击，是十分准确的。列宁异常称赞《无产阶级斗争报》，称赞它的马克思主义坚定性，并且称赞它的高度的文艺价值。
    一九○五年十二月武装起义失败以后，布尔塞维克与孟塞维克的斗争，更加剧烈起来了。无政府工团主义者也出台活动，在梯弗里斯城尤其喧闹得厉害。斯大林坚决地捍卫着布尔塞维克的革命路线，成为在南高加索对一切反无产阶级派别作斗争的中心人物。一九○六年四月，俄国社会民主工党在斯托哥尔摩召集了第四次代表大会。斯大林在这次大会结束以后，重新回到南高加索工作。他领导布尔塞维克在梯弗里斯用格鲁吉亚文公开出版了一系列的报纸：一九○六年六月——七月的《新生活报》，《新生活报》被封闭以后，又在一九○六年十二月与一九○七年一月出版了《新时代报》，《新时代报》被封闭以后，又在一九○七年二月十八日至三月六日出版了《我们的生活报》，《我们的生活报》被封闭后，又在同年三月十一日至四月十五日出版了《时代报》。
    以这一系列的党报为武器，斯大林进行了反对孟塞维主义与无政府主义的坚决的斗争。斯大林在“无政府主义还是社会主义”的总标题下，发表了有系统的辉煌的论文。在这些论文中，斯大林用通俗易懂的文字解释了什么是唯物主义与辩证法，什么是历史唯物主义。他非常深刻地提出了并解决了马列主义理论的根本问题，即社会主义革命与无产阶级专政必不可免，以及根本与第二国际改良主义旧式政党不同的新式战斗无产阶级政党绝对必要的问题，同时又说明了布尔塞维克战略和策略的基础。
    一九○七年四五月间，俄国社会民主工党在伦敦召集了第五次代表大会。斯大林在会后回到俄国，奉命到巴库领导工人运动。这时的俄国，正处在斯托雷平反动猖獗的黑夜里。可是，斯大林革命活动中的巴库时期却是布尔塞维主义在巴库组织中获得完全胜利的时期。斯大林组织了排除巴库各工人区（巴拉汉内，比比爱巴特，黑城，白城）内所有孟塞维克的斗争。他主持了布尔塞维克出版的秘密和公开的机关报《巴库无产者》、《汽笛》和《巴库工人》。在巴库工人的英勇斗争中，他所创办的公开报纸发出了响亮的呼声。
    一九○八年三月二十五日，斯大林被捕，经过将近八个月的监禁以后，又被流放到沃罗果达，期限两年。但到一九○九年六月二十四日，他就逃回了巴库，继续从事秘密工作。在这一时期的中央党刊上，斯大林发表了具有重大历史意义的几封《高加索通信》；在《巴库无产者》报上，斯大林发表了《党内的危机和我们的任务》，《党内生活》及其他许多论文。
    一九一○年三月至一九一一年九月，斯大林先后在巴库和彼得堡两次被捕，两次被流放到沃罗果达。一九一二年一月，俄国社会民主工党在普拉加召集了党的代表会议，建立了实际领导俄国革命工作的中央机关（俄国中央局），并通过了创办《真理报》的决议。斯大林在他因被捕而缺席的时候，由代表会议选进了中央委员会。根据列宁的提议，决定由斯大林主持俄国中央局。斯大林于接到列宁的通知以后，在一九一二年二月二十九日，又逃回了彼得堡。在这以后一个极其短促的时间中，斯大林进行了许多重大的工作，其中伟大事件之一便是出版了奠定一九一七年胜利基础的《真理报》。
    《真理报》是斯大林遵照列宁的指示创办的。《真理报》的第一期是在斯大林指导下编好的。斯大林决定《真理报》的方向是要合乎群众的、工人们的旨趣。可是，在《真理报》出版的第一天，一九一二年五月五日，斯大林就在彼得堡街道上被捕了。经过几个月监禁以后，斯大林被流放到更辽远的纳赖姆边区。但到一九一二年九月一日，斯大林又从流放所逃到了彼得堡。党中央立即派他领导《真理报》和《明星报》以及第四届国家杜马选举运动的工作。其时列宁已经从巴黎移居克拉科夫城，因为这里距离彼得堡较近，便于领导《真理报》和日益增长着的国内工人运动。列宁在这里三天以内便可以收到从彼得堡寄来的《真理报》，他经过《真理报》编辑部秘书莫洛托夫和《真理报》保持着密切的联系。但是，即使如此，《真理报》的工作也还是使列宁时感焦虑的。《真理报》编辑部为了避免书报检查，放弃了对取消派的斗争，列宁《论选举政纲》一文因编辑认为“愤怒的音调是有妨碍的”没有发表。斯大林之被派回到《真理报》去，就是为的帮助《真理报》实行正确的党的路线。在斯大林参加工作以后，莫洛托夫很欣喜地把斯大林的工作情形报告列宁说：“你想必已经知道，在编辑部内发生了一些为你所乐意的变更。”列宁密切地和斯大林建立联系。斯大林的活动、言论和文章，得到列宁的完全的嘉许。列宁读到斯大林论彼得堡工人选民团中选举总结的文章《谁胜利了》时，就把他对这篇文章的意见通知给编辑部说：“我不能不为第一四六期社论向你们表示庆贺”。第四届国家杜马选举运动的结果，是布尔塞维克党获得了胜利。斯大林所写的“彼得堡工人授予所选代表的委托书”，在这里起了极大的作用。列宁对这个“委托书”深为嘉许，他在把“委托书”交去付印时加上了这样的批注：“付印后，一定要把原稿拿回来！！切勿把它弄脏。把这个文件保存起来是极重要的。”列宁在给编辑部的信中指示说：“一定要用大号字把这授予彼得堡代表的委托书登载在最显著的篇幅上。”在这一时期中，斯大林曾经两次到克拉科夫城访问列宁，并参加中央和党工作者的联席会议。在斯大林出国时期，《真理报》的种种老毛病又重复起来。列宁认为必须改造编辑部，必须派一个很有党工作经验的编辑到那里去。列宁就和斯大林详细商定关于改组《真理报》领导的问题，并预定在斯大林回国以后立即进行改组。但斯大林回国以后，很快就被捕了。到一九一四年初，斯大林被流放到了距离北极圈很近的库莱卡村。他在这里渡过了一九一四，一九一五和一九一六年。这要算是极偏僻的西伯利亚最痛苦的政治流放了。在这一时期中，在一九一四年夏，爆发了帝国主义的世界大战。一九一七年三月八日，斯大林挨过千辛万苦，重新逃到了俄国革命首都彼得堡，并且又一次被党中央委托以领导《真理报》的工作。
    《真理报》在一九一二年创刊以后，一直在沙皇警察的迫害之下。警察在两年半时间内把《真理报》封闭过八次，但《真理报》在工人援助下总又用一种新的相似的名称如“拥护真理”，“真理之路”，“劳动真理”等等继续出版。而在一九一四年帝国主义大战爆发时，终于把它最后封闭了。在停刊差不多三年以后，一九一七年三月十八日，《真理报》又复刊了，并且又获得了它的创办人斯大林的领导。当时列宁还侨居在国外，资产阶级临时政府用各种手段阻碍列宁回国。在这个情势复杂、责任艰巨的时期，只有斯大林不断在《真理报》著文指示布尔塞维克党员的工作，号召人民进行革命，建立人民革命政权——苏维埃。
    一九一七年四月十六日夜间，列宁在经过长期流亡生活以后，从国外回到了彼得堡。这是布尔塞维克与资产阶级临时政府斗争十分尖锐的时期，在七月十六日的一次示威中，孟塞维克和社会党人联合资产阶级及白卫将军们对示威的工人兵士实行了血腥的镇压，并捣毁了《真理报》编辑部，封闭了《真理报》、《士兵真理报》及其他许多布尔塞维克报纸。列宁因受到反革命临时政府的诬陷和迫害，不得不暂时躲藏起来，并且由他的最亲近的同志斯大林护送到芬兰去。这以后一个时期，斯大林直接领导着党中央委员会，先后用各种名称如《工人与士兵》，《无产者》，《工人》，《工人之路》出版党的中央机关报。斯大林经常在党报上发表指示性论文，指导着全国布尔塞维克的斗争。这一时期中央党报的最后一种——《工人之路》，在十月革命的前一日作过光荣的出版斗争。克伦斯基所领导的资产阶级临时政府在布尔塞维克武装起义的前夕，企图先发制人地扑灭布尔塞维克的武装起义，就在十一月六日，下令攻打武装起义司令部所在地的斯莫尔尼宫，并于同日清晨派出装甲汽车包围《工人之路》编辑部和印刷所，查封《工人之路》。斯大林下令击退装甲汽车并保证报纸出版。赤卫队员和兵士们执行了这个命令。上午十一点钟，《工人之路》出版了。报上登载着斯大林所写的社论《我们需要什么》，号召群众推翻临时政府。大队革命士兵和赤卫队员遵照党中央机关的命令，调到了斯莫尔尼宫附近。起义开始了。曾经以各种不同的名称出版过的党中央机关报《真理报》，在起义第二天（十一月七日）向世界宣告了伟大的十月社会主义革命成功的消息。
    列宁斯大林的党报工作的历史是和布尔塞维克建党的历史分不开的。列宁以报纸为宣传、鼓动与组织群众的有力武器，斯大林在他的革命斗争中，忠实地执行了列宁的这一指示。他始终是党报工作的实际领导者和编辑，他和列宁一样，经常注意到党报工作的每一小节，他使党报成为布尔塞维克指导群众的同时又是群众自己的报纸，而《真理报》就是列宁和斯大林为党报工作所创造的典型的范例。
