[Beijing News] The China Association of Scientific Workers issued a declaration in support of Foreign Minister Zhou's note requesting the United Nations to expel the Kuomintang bandit gang representatives and appoint Zhang Wentian as the chief representative of the People's Republic of China. The full text is as follows:

On January 8th of this year, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, sent a telegram to Mr. Romulo, Chairman of the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary-General Trygve Lie, and all member states of the Security Council, requesting that the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group be expelled from the Security Council. On January 19th, Minister Zhou Enlai further notified the United Nations that our Central People's Government had appointed Zhang Wentian as the chief representative of the People's Republic of China to attend United Nations meetings. This is a necessary and timely measure, and also a solemn and just proposition, which not only meets the demands of the entire Chinese people, but also meets the demands of progressive people all over the world. We express our warm support for this solemn proposition.

As early as last year, after the establishment of our Central People's Government, Minister Zhou Enlai had already sent a telegram to the United Nations General Assembly, denying the legal status of the delegation dispatched by the so-called "Chinese National Government." At that time, representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries had repeatedly called the attention of the General Assembly to this statement by Minister Zhou. Unfortunately, the majority of representatives in the United Nations, especially the group headed by US imperialism, still disregarded the will and strength of the Chinese people, supported the bandit gang representatives, and staged an ugly farce. The United Nations is such a solemn organization, yet it allows a "delegation" that is not qualified to represent China to engage in reckless activities. This is not only an insult to the Chinese people, but also an insult to the United Nations itself.

We want to point out: the so-called "Chinese delegation" that is still entrenched in the United Nations organization has never represented the Chinese people. Moreover, even the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang it represents has long since disintegrated, the bandit gang leaders are fleeing for their lives, and the bandit gang regime has virtually ceased to exist. This so-called "Chinese delegation" has long become a political corpse. Who can it represent? If it still has any representativeness, it is nothing more than representing the US imperialists as a mouthpiece of the US imperialists.

Today, the Chinese people have stood up strongly. The Chinese people, on the basis of achieving complete victory, have the right to declare to the world: the Central People's Government is the only legal government representing all the people of the People's Republic of China; and has the right to declare to the United Nations: expel the "delegation" of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang. Only the delegation headed by Zhang Wentian, appointed by the Central People's Government, is the legitimate delegation that truly represents the Chinese people.

In order to protest the illegal attendance of the bandit gang "delegation" at the United Nations, the representatives of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have unanimously withdrawn from the meetings of the United Nations agencies. We express our infinite admiration for the just stance of the Soviet Union and other countries. At the same time, we urge other member states of the United Nations to pay attention to the demands of Minister Zhou Enlai's repeated statements, and to quickly expel the "delegation" of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang from the United Nations, and invite the legitimate delegation of the People's Republic of China to participate in the work. Only in this way will it conform to the wishes of the Chinese people, and only in this way can the dignity of the United Nations and its member states be maintained.

    科学工作者协会发表宣言
    拥护周外长照会
    指责联合国容许匪帮代表团是侮辱中国人民，也侮辱了联合国本身。
    【北京讯】中国科学工作者协会为拥护周外长要求联合国开除国民党匪帮代表并任命张闻天为中华人民共和国首席代表的照会发表宣言，全文如下：
    本年一月八日，中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长致电联合国大会主席罗慕洛、秘书长赖伊并转安全理事会各会员国，要求把国民党反动残余集团的代表从安全理事会开除出去。一月十九日，周恩来部长又通知联合国：我中央人民政府已任命张闻天为中华人民共和国出席联合国会议的首席代表。这是一个必要适时的措置，也是庄重严正的主张，不但符合全中国人民的要求，也是符合全世界进步人民的要求。我们对于这严正的主张表示热烈的拥护。
    早在去年我中央人民政府成立后，周恩来部长就已致电联合国大会，否认所谓“中国国民政府”派遣的代表团的合法地位。其时，苏联、波兰、捷克等国的代表，并曾根据周部长这一声明，一再唤起大会注意。不幸联合国中多数代表，尤其是以美帝国主义为首的集团，依然无视中国人民的意志和力量，支持匪帮代表，排演丑剧。联合国是何等庄严的组织，竟容许一个没有资格代表中国的“代表团”胡乱活动，这不仅是侮辱了中国人民，实在也侮辱了联合国本身。
    我们要指出：现在还盘踞在联合国组织里的所谓“中国代表团”，它从未代表过中国人民，而且连它所代表的国民党残余匪帮，早已土崩瓦解，匪帮头目流亡逃命，匪帮政权实际上早已不复存在，这个所谓“中国代表团”亦早已成为政治上的僵尸。它能代表谁呢？如果说它还有代表性，无非代表美帝作为美帝的传声筒罢了。
    今天，中国人民已坚强地站起来了。在取得完全胜利基础上的中国人民，有权利向全世界宣告：中央人民政府为代表中华人民共和国全体人民的唯一合法政府；更有权利向联合国声明：把国民党残余匪帮的“代表团”开除出去。只有中央人民政府所任命的张闻天为首的代表团，才是真正代表中国人民的合法代表团。
    为了抗议匪帮“代表团”的非法出席联合国，苏联和人民民主国家的代表已一致从联合国机构的会议上退席。对于苏联等国的正义立场，我们表示无限的钦敬。同时，我们更要请联合国其他会员国注意，依照周恩来部长迭次声明的要求，迅速把国民党残余匪帮的“代表团”从联合国内开除出去，并邀请中华人民共和国的合法代表团参加工作。只有这样，才是符合中国人民的愿望，也只有这样，才能保持联合国及其会员国的尊严。
