Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd: TASS Moscow News: The Soviet people and millions of working people abroad commemorated the 26th anniversary of the death of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the founder and leader of the great Bolshevik Party and the world's first socialist country, and the wise teacher of working people all over the world, on January 21st. In these days of mourning for Lenin, the Soviet people commemorate Lenin and review the heroic path our motherland has traveled in these years.

On January 21st, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, the Moscow Oblast Committee and the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), the Soviets of Working People's Deputies of Moscow Oblast and Moscow City, the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, the Moscow City and Moscow Oblast Committees of the Leninist Young Communist League, and the Presidium of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, together with representatives of the Party, public organizations, and the Soviet Army, held a solemn memorial meeting at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow to commemorate the 26th anniversary of the death of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.

A huge portrait of Lenin decorated with flowers was hung on the stage, and honor guards were arranged. At 6:50 PM, Comrades Stalin, Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Khrushchev, Bulganin, Shvernik, Kosygin, Suslov, Ponomarev, and Shkiryatov took their seats on the presidium. Mao Zedong, leader of the Chinese Communist Party, and Zhou Enlai, member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, also took their seats on the presidium.

Comrade Stalin, who inherited Lenin's cause with his genius, was greeted with the warmest welcome from the audience. Stormy applause resounded throughout the hall, expressing the heartfelt love and gratitude of the participants for the great leader of the Soviet people.

Chairman Shvernik said:
	Lenin's Rich Life was Full of Heroic Labor and Merits

Comrade Chairman Shvernik delivered a brief speech, saying:

	Comrades! It has been twenty-six years since the death of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the great revolutionary, the genius thinker, the organizer of the Bolshevik Communist Party, and the founder of the first Soviet socialist state in the world. I propose that everyone stand up to mourn Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. (The audience stood in silence)

	Vladimir Ilyich Lenin's rich life was full of heroic labor and merits. He dedicated his life to the struggle of the working class and peasants to liberate themselves from the rule of capitalists and landlords, to the victory of the proletarian socialist revolution, and to the struggle for the realization of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	Under Lenin's leadership, the Bolshevik Party established the Soviet system in our country, laid the foundation for a socialist society, and led the working people onto the broad road of building socialism. Lenin's ideas can be found in the practical lives of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, in the rapid growth of industry and agriculture, in the development of science, technology, and culture, and in all aspects of socialist social life, with the most profound and convincing evidence.

	After Lenin's death, the Bolshevik Party, headed by Comrade Stalin, held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and guided our country along Lenin's path, achieving one victory after another. Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin's Party, the Soviet people have already achieved the victory of socialism in our country and, in the post-war period, have achieved the restoration of the national economy and the further improvement of the material and cultural levels of the various nationalities.

	The success of the Soviet Union has given millions of working people in capitalist countries confidence in their liberation from the shackles of capital, in the victory of world peace, and in democracy and socialism. In this struggle for the freedom and happiness of mankind, Lenin's great banner flies over our heads, and this banner is now tightly held in the hands of the Bolshevik Communist Party, in the hands of Comrade Stalin, Lenin's loyal comrade-in-arms and the great successor to Lenin's cause. (Stormy applause)

	Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin's Party, the Soviet people will continue to advance along Lenin's road to the victory of communism! (Stormy applause)

Comrade Shvernik announced the official opening of the solemn memorial meeting.

Poskrebyshev reports:
	The Socialist Revolution Led by Lenin Opened a New Era in World History

Comrade Poskrebyshev took the stage to report.

Comrade Poskrebyshev said that twenty-six years have passed since that sad day, January 21, 1924, when Comrade Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the father of our Soviet revolution, the founder of the Bolshevik Party and the socialist state, the great teacher, leader and friend of the working people of the world, passed away. The speaker recounted the historically significant days of October 1917, when the great October Socialist Revolution prepared by Lenin was successful. This revolution opened a new era in world history, the era of the collapse of capitalism and the victory of socialism.

Comrade Poskrebyshev described the characteristics of the path our country has traversed in these twenty-six years under Lenin's banner and under Comrade Stalin's leadership.

Poskrebyshev said: Stalin most wisely presented the Party and the people with the task of rapidly implementing socialist industrialization, the purpose of which was to maintain the independence of our socialist motherland and ensure the victory of socialism. Our country has already completed the great cause of socialist industrialization within the historically significant time frame pointed out by Comrade Stalin. In terms of its military, technical and economic power, the socialist state surpassed Hitler's Germany, it became the victor in the mortal struggle against fascism, and liberated the European people from fascist enslavement.

The reason why the Soviet people were able to achieve this epoch-making victory of socialism is primarily due to the wise leadership of the great leader and teacher of the Party and the people, and due to Comrade Stalin, the greatest strategist and commander in history.

Comrade Stalin led our people to achieve the epoch-making victory of socialism. Lenin's prediction has become a reality in our era with miraculous power - our communist economic construction has become an example for the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia.

Poskrebyshev said that the Soviet people are commemorating the twenty-sixth anniversary of Lenin's death in the midst of a strong upsurge in all aspects of the socialist economy and culture.

The Soviet social and state system is the best form of social organization that surpasses any non-Soviet social system, a fact that has been proven in the post-war period with new strength and irrefutable facts before the world.

The speaker then described the rising material and cultural welfare of the working people. He emphasized that no one in the world has made such a great contribution to this great cause—the realization of the universal happiness of the people and the happiness of all working people—as Lenin and Stalin.

No force in the world can stop the Soviet people from irresistibly moving towards communism!

The entire course of historical development has confirmed Lenin and Stalin's wise scientific predictions.

The entire course of historical development has confirmed the wise scientific predictions of Lenin and Stalin, the great strategists of the proletariat, regarding the inevitability of the further development and deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, and the inevitability of certain countries breaking away from the capitalist system through revolution. Poskrebyshev spoke of the formation of several people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia and the fact that these countries' departure from the capitalist system is proof of the increasing depth of the general crisis of capitalism. Capitalism is increasingly losing its former "stability." The rule of imperialism over colonial and semi-colonial countries is being increasingly disrupted. The historically significant victory of the great Chinese People's Revolution is a serious defeat for world imperialism.

The speaker emphasized that the reason why the camp of imperialism and war instigators is so angry is because it feels its internal weakness and historical demise.

The forces of peace, socialism, and democracy are growing and constantly strengthening. The political and economic power of the people's democratic countries is also growing, and the status of the working people in these countries is constantly improving.

An organized front of peace supporters has been formed for the first time in history. This front includes not only the working people of the people's democratic countries but also all progressive men and women in capitalist countries. The great Stalin's strategy of peace, starting from Lenin's legacy, is gaining more and more supporters. The people of the world regard Comrade Stalin as the most determined, unyielding and wise fighter for peace. He uses every means to thwart the massacre plans of the new war instigators. The people of the world regard Comrade Stalin as the great leader and teacher of the entire powerful camp of peace, democracy and socialism. (Stormy applause)

Poskrebyshev spoke of the glorious Party of Lenin and Stalin, the leading force of Soviet society, leading the Soviet people forward on the road to a communist society.

In concluding his report, Poskrebyshev shouted, for the great, invincible banner of Lenin and Stalin, for the heroic Party of Lenin and Stalin, for our beloved leader, teacher and father Comrade Stalin, for the wise genius who led the Soviet people to the victory of communism!

The audience responded to the report with prolonged and stormy applause and stood up to pay tribute to Comrade Stalin. With great enthusiasm, the participants sang the Party anthem, "The Internationale."

    【新华社北京二十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联人民和外国千百万劳动群众都在一月二十一日纪念伟大的布尔什维克党和世界上第一个社会主义国家的缔造者与领袖，全世界劳动人民英明的导师——乌拉第米尔·伊里奇·列宁逝世二十六周年。在悼念列宁的日子里，苏联全国人民纪念着列宁，并回顾这些年中我们祖国所走过的英雄道路。
    一月二十一日，苏联共产党（布）中央委员会、苏联最高苏维埃主席团和俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃主席团、苏联共产党（布）莫斯科州委员会和莫斯科市委员会、莫斯科州与莫斯科市劳动人民代表苏维埃、苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会、列宁共产主义青年团莫斯科市与莫斯科州委员会、全苏职工会中央委员会主席团，会同党的、公共团体的以及苏军的代表，在莫斯科大剧院举行乌拉第米尔·伊里奇·列宁逝世二十六周年的庄严的纪念大会。
    台上挂着饰以鲜花的巨幅列宁画像，并布置了仪仗兵。午后六时五十分，斯大林、莫洛托夫、马林科夫、贝利亚、伏罗希洛夫、米高扬、赫鲁舍切夫、布尔加宁、什维尔尼克、柯西金、苏斯洛夫、波诺马林科和施利基亚托夫等同志，在主席团的席位上就座。中国共产党领袖毛泽东和中国共产党政治局委员周恩来，也在主席团席位上就座。
    以天才的力量继承着列宁事业的斯大林同志，受到全场最热烈的欢迎。暴风雨般的掌声响彻会场，表示与会者对苏维埃人民的伟大领袖热烈的爱戴与感激之忱。
    主席什维尔尼克说：
    列宁的经历丰富的一生充满英雄的劳动与功勋
    主席什维尔尼克同志发表简短演讲说：
    同志们！自从伟大的革命家、天才思想家、布尔塞维克的共产党的组织者和世界上第一个苏维埃社会主义国家的缔造者——乌拉第米尔·伊里奇·列宁逝世至今已经二十六年了。我提议大家起立，悼念乌拉第米尔·伊里奇·列宁。（全场肃立）
    乌拉第米尔·伊里奇·列宁的经历丰富的一生，充满了英雄的劳动与功勋。他把毕生献给工人阶级与农民争取从资本家与地主的政权下获得解放的斗争，献给争取无产阶级社会主义革命的胜利，献给争取无产阶级专政的实现的斗争。
    在列宁的领导下，布尔塞维克党在我国建立了苏维埃制度，奠定了社会主义社会的基础，领导劳动人民踏上建设社会主义的康庄大道。列宁的思想在苏联各族人民的实际生活中，在工业与农业的急剧成长中，在科学、技术与文化的发展中，在社会主义社会生活各方面的表现中，都可以找到最深刻的和最令人信服的明证。
    列宁逝世后，以斯大林同志为首的布尔塞维克党，高举了马克思——列宁主义的旗帜，引导我国沿着列宁的道路，一次接着一次地取得胜利。在列宁和斯大林党的领导下，苏维埃人民业已使社会主义在我国取得胜利，在战后时期达到了国民经济的恢复及各族人民的物质与文化水平的进一步提高。
    苏联的成功，使资本主义国家里数以百万计的劳动人民，对于从资本的枷锁下获得解放，对于全世界和平的胜利，以及对于民主和社会主义具有信心。在这一争取人类自由幸福的斗争当中，列宁的伟大旗帜在我们头上飘扬着，这个旗帜现在是在布尔塞维克的共产党的手里，在列宁的忠实战友、列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林同志手里紧握着。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    在列宁和斯大林党的领导之下，苏联人民今后也将循着列宁的通往共产主义胜利的道路前进！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    什维尔尼克同志宣布庄严的纪念会正式开始。
    波斯伯洛夫报告：
    列宁领导的社会主义革命开辟了世界历史的新纪元
    波斯伯洛夫同志登台报告。
    波斯伯洛夫同志说，自从一九二四年一月二十一日我们苏维埃革命之父、布尔塞维克党和社会主义国家的缔造者、全世界劳动人民的伟大导师、领袖和朋友乌拉第米尔·伊里奇·列宁同志逝世这个悲哀日子到现在，已经有二十六年了。演说者追述一九一七年十月的具有历史意义的日子，列宁所准备的伟大的十月社会主义革命，就是在这时成功。这个革命开辟了世界历史的新纪元，资本主义崩溃和社会主义胜利的纪元。
    波斯伯洛夫同志叙述了我们国家这二十六年内，在列宁的旗帜之下，在斯大林同志的领导下所经历的道路的特点。
    波斯伯洛夫说：斯大林极为英明地向党和人民提出了迅速实施社会主义工业化的任务，其目的是在于保持我们社会主义祖国的独立和保证社会主义的胜利。我们国家已经在斯大林同志所指出的具有历史意义的期限之内，完成了社会主义工业化的伟大事业。就其军事、技术及经济的威力来讲，社会主义国家超过了希特勒德国，它在对法西斯主义的殊死斗争中成为胜利者，并且将欧洲人民从法西斯奴役之下解放出来。
    苏联人民所以能获得这次社会主义的划时代的胜利，首先是由于党和人民的伟大领袖和导师的英明领导，由于历史上最伟大的战略家和指挥官斯大林同志。
    斯大林同志领导我们人民获得社会主义的划时代胜利。列宁的预言已经在我们的时代里以奇迹般的力量成为事实——我们的共产主义经济建设已经成为欧洲和亚洲人民民主国家的榜样。
    波斯伯洛夫说，苏联人民是在社会主义经济和文化各方面的强大高涨之中，纪念着列宁的二十六周年忌辰。
    苏维埃的社会和国家制度，是胜过任何非苏维埃社会制度的最好的社会组织形式，这个事实在战后时期已经以新的力量和无可辩驳的事实，在全世界的面前获得证明。
    演说者继而叙述劳动人民物质福利和文化福利的高涨。他强调指出，世界上没有一个人对于这个伟大事业——人民的普遍幸福和一切劳动人民的幸福的实现——有过像列宁和斯大林这样巨大的贡献。
    世界上没有一个力量能制止苏联人民无可抵挡地朝着共产主义前进！
    历史发展的全部过程，已证实了列宁斯大林英明的科学预见。
    历史发展的全部历程，已经证实了无产阶级伟大的战略家列宁和斯大林的英明的科学预见，即关于资本主义总危机进一步发展和加深的必然性，关于某些国家以革命方式摆脱资本主义制度的必然性。波斯伯洛夫谈到欧洲和亚洲若干人民民主国家的形成以及这些国家的摆脱资本主义制度是资本主义总危机愈益加深的证明。资本主义正在日益丧失它往日的“稳定”。帝国主义对殖民地和半殖民地国家的统治，受着愈来愈剧烈的破坏。伟大的中国人民革命的具有历史意义的胜利，乃是世界帝国主义的严重失败。
    演说者强调指出，帝国主义和战争挑拨者阵营的所以恼怒万分，就是因为感觉到它的内在弱点和历史末日。
    拥护和平、社会主义和民主的力量正在增长，并不断增强着。人民民主国家的政治和经济威力也正在增长中，这些国家的劳动人民的地位正在不断地改善着。
    有组织的和平拥护者阵线，已经在历史上第一次形成起来。这个阵线不仅包括人民民主国家的劳动人民，而且还包括资本主义国家的一切进步男女。从列宁的遗训出发的伟大的斯大林和平战略，正在获得愈来愈多的支持者。世界人民把斯大林同志看作最坚决、最不屈不挠与明智的和平战士。他用尽一切办法来挫败新战争挑拨者的屠杀计划。世界人民把斯大林同志看作整个和平、民主与社会主义强大阵营的伟大领袖和导师。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    波斯伯洛夫讲到领导苏联人民沿着通往共产主义的社会向前迈进的、苏维埃社会的领导力量——列宁与斯大林的光荣的党。
    波斯伯洛夫在结束报告时，为伟大的、不可战胜的列宁与斯大林的旗帜，为列宁与斯大林的英雄的党，为我们敬爱的领袖、导师和父亲斯大林同志、为领导苏维埃人民走向共产主义胜利的英明天才而欢呼！
    听众对这一报告报以经久不息的暴风雨般的鼓掌，并起立向斯大林同志致敬。与会者以极大的热情，齐唱党歌《国际歌》。
