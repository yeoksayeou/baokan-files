    Mass Theater to Open Tomorrow
    [This newspaper] The Mass Theater (located at Xiaoxiao Bridge, Xianyu Kou in this city, the former site of the Huale Theater), sponsored by the Bureau of Opera Reform of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, is scheduled to officially open on January 22nd. This theater has made preliminary reforms in its management system in order to experiment with new operas. The opening performance will be "Three Attacks on the Zhu Family Village," performed by the Peking Opera Research Institute of the Bureau of Opera Reform of the Ministry of Culture, with the assistance of the Art Department of the Bureau of Opera Reform and the Opera Experimental School. More than 70 actors will participate, and the executive directors are Comrades Li Zigui and Zheng Yiqiu. "Three Attacks on the Zhu Family Village" was collectively created in 1944 by Li Lun, Ren Guilin, Wei Chenxu, and other comrades from the Yan'an Peking Opera Troupe. It was later supplemented after collective discussions by directors and actors. Chairman Mao once believed that the performance of this play "consolidated the path of Peking Opera reform." Performances in various parts of the liberated areas won enthusiastic love from the broad masses. This performance script has been revised by Comrade Wei Chenxu, and the play, which originally took two days to perform, has been reduced to one performance, concentrating on retaining all the essence of the original script and making up for certain shortcomings in the original script's strategic thinking. This performance brings together many excellent actors and has undergone serious rehearsals.

    大众剧场明日开幕
    【本报讯】中央人民政府文化部戏曲改进局主办的大众剧场（在本市鲜鱼口小桥，原华乐戏院旧址）订于本月二十二日正式开幕。这个剧场为了实验新戏曲，在管理制度上，有初步的改革。开幕的第一次演出，是文化部戏曲改进局京剧研究院演出的《三打祝家庄》，并约请了戏曲改进局艺术处和戏曲实验学校协助演出。参加的演员共七十余位，执行导演为李紫贵、郑亦秋同志。《三打祝家庄》是一九四四年由延安平剧院李纶、任桂林、魏晨旭诸同志集体创作的，后又经过导演、演员们的集体讨论，再加补充。毛主席曾认为这剧的演出，“巩固了平剧改革的道路”，解放区各地演出，博得广大群众的热烈喜爱。这一次的演出本，是经过魏晨旭同志重新修订的，已经把两天才能演完的戏，缩减到一次演完，并集中保留了原剧本的全部精华，弥补了原剧本在策略思想上的某些缺点。这一次的演出，集中了很多优秀的演员，并曾经过认真排演。
