Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 2nd: The preliminary recovery plan for national steel production in 1950 has been formulated by the National Steel Conference convened by the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government. The National Steel Conference was held from December 16th to 25th, attended by relevant responsible persons and experts from the major administrative regions of Northeast, North China, Central South China, East China, and Northwest.

    The conference determined the production tasks for pig iron, steel ingots, and steel materials in 1950, as well as new construction project plans and investment allocation, with the Northeast as the focus.
            
            Increase Steel Rolling and Steelmaking Capacity

    The conference also made clear decisions on several relevant technical issues. The most important of these is the issue of balancing the capacity of iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling. In the past, China's steel industry had a strong colonial character. The capacity of steelmaking was less than the capacity of iron smelting, and the capacity of steel rolling was less than the capacity of steelmaking. As a result, much pig iron could not be turned into steel, and many steel ingots could not be rolled into steel materials, making it necessary to rely on foreign imperialism. The conference decided on several specific measures to increase the capacity of steel rolling and steelmaking, in order to begin to change the above-mentioned unreasonable situation.
            
            Overall Planning for the Allocation of Technical Personnel

    The conference made overall plans for the allocation of steel technical cadres. The country is severely lacking steel technical cadres, who only account for 0.71% of the total number of steel industry employees. Among them, North China accounts for 2% of its total employees, Taiyuan 2%, East China 4.6%, Central South China 3.5%, while the Northeast, as the focus of steel production recovery, is most lacking in technical cadres, accounting for only 0.2% of its total employees. Therefore, the conference decided to transfer a large number of technical personnel from North China, East China, and Central South China to work in the Northeast. The conference decided that the Ministry of Heavy Industry should immediately convene the heads of industrial departments from various regions to discuss the preliminary list of personnel to be transferred, especially the transfer of senior technical personnel, which can be decided immediately. The conference instructed the responsible comrades of the industrial departments in various regions to regard the mobilization and assistance of the transferred personnel to go to the Northeast smoothly as one of their serious tasks. The conference also instructed the Northeast Industrial Department to provide the personnel transferred to the Northeast with appropriate work and to earnestly take care of their own lives and the lives of their families. The Ministry of Heavy Industry also instructed the industrial departments in various regions, with the assistance of the people's governments in various regions, to earnestly investigate and register technical talents and encourage them to participate in the construction of New China's heavy industry. This group of talent and a portion of the 1950 graduates from science and engineering departments of national universities and specialized schools will be uniformly allocated by the Ministry of Heavy Industry.
            
            Vigorously Cultivate Technical Talent

    The conference also focused on discussing the issue of cultivating technical talent. The conference emphasized that this matter should be regarded as one of the main tasks of the relevant departments in various regions. The conference decided that it is necessary to vigorously run schools and training courses attached to various enterprises; and instructed various enterprises to universally establish workers' night schools and remedial classes, rapidly improve workers' cultural level, and provide workers with an existing cultural foundation with favorable conditions for learning, and quickly send them to schools for training, so that they can become technical cadres. The conference decided that various enterprise units should earnestly conduct spare-time technical education for in-service cadres. The progress of in-service cadres in business learning is one of the standards for performance evaluation. The promotion of cadres in each factory must also be based on their business level. The conference also decided that the work of cultivating cadres in various enterprises is one of the standards for the Ministry of Heavy Industry to assess their performance.

    In addition, the conference made specific decisions on major issues such as the organizational structure of the national steel industry, the wages and benefits of employees, financial allocation, product distribution, and the supply of raw materials.

    The conference successively listened to the instructions and reports of Vice Chairman Zhu of the Central People's Government, Premier Zhou of the State Council, Director of the Financial and Economic Committee and Minister of Heavy Industry Chen Yun, and Vice Ministers of Heavy Industry He Changgong and Zhong Lin. These reports greatly increased the confidence of the representatives from various regions in the great task of restoring and developing heavy industry as the focus and establishing the foundation for national industrialization.

    全国钢铁会议胜利结束
    制定今年钢铁生产计划
    号召大批技术人员赴东北工作
    【新华社北京二日电】一九五○年全国钢铁生产的初步恢复计划，已由中央人民政府重工业部召开的全国钢铁会议制定。全国钢铁会议系于十二月十六日至二十五日召开，出席的有东北、华北、华中南、华东、西北各大行政区的有关负责人和专家。
    会议确定了一九五○年生铁、钢锭、钢材的生产任务与新建工程计划及投资分配，均以东北为重点。
            增加轧钢炼钢能力
    会议对若干有关的技术问题，也做了明确的决定。其中最重要的是平衡炼铁、制钢、轧钢三者的能力问题。过去中国的钢铁事业带着很浓厚的殖民地性，制钢的能力小于炼铁的能力，轧钢的能力又小于制钢的能力，因此有许多生铁不能变成钢，许多钢锭不能轧成钢材，以致不能不仰赖外国帝国主义。会议决定了若干具体办法增加轧钢和炼钢的能力，以开始改变上述不合理的状态。
            通盘筹划配备技术人员
    会议对钢铁技术干部的配备做了通盘的筹划。全国钢铁技术干部非常缺乏，仅占钢铁业职工总人数的百分之零点七一，其中华北占其职工总数的百分之二，太原百分之二，华东百分之四·六，华中南百分之三·五，而东北为恢复钢铁生产的重点，技术干部却最为缺乏，仅占其职工总数的百分之零点二。因此会议决定从华北、华东、华中南地区抽调大批技术人员赴东北工作。会议决定即由重工业部召集各地区工业部门负责人商定初步调用人员名单，尤其是高级技术人员之调动，可即行决定。会议责成各地区工业部门负责同志把动员及协助被调人员顺利前去东北一事，当成自己的严重任务之一。会议并责成东北工业部给予被调赴东北的人员以适当的工作，并切实照顾其本人及其眷属的生活。重工业部又责成各地区工业部门在各地区人民政府协助之下，切实调查与登记技术人材，鼓励其参加新中国重工业的建设。此项人材及一九五○年全国各大学、专科学校理工科毕业学生的一部分将由重工业部统一支配。
            大力培养技术人材
    会议并着重讨论了技术人材的培养问题。会议强调指出此事应作为各地区有关部门主要业务之一。会议决定必须大力办好各企业附设的学校和训练班；并责成各企业普遍建立工人夜校和补习班，迅速提高工人文化水平，并给予已有文化基础的工人以学习的有利条件，迅速送入学校受训，使其成为技术干部。会议决定各企业单位对在职干部，应切实进行业余技术教育。在职干部业务学习的进步，为考绩的标准之一。各厂提拔干部，亦须以其业务程度为依据。会议又决定各企业培养干部的工作，为重工业部考核其成绩的标准之一。
    此外，会议对全国钢铁事业的组织机构问题，职工工资福利问题，财务调拨、产品分配及原材料之供应等等重大问题，都作了具体的决定。
    会议曾先后听取了中央人民政府朱副主席、政务院周总理、财经委员会主任兼重工业部部长陈云，重工业部副部长何长工、钟林的指示和报告。这些报告使到会的各地代表对于以恢复和发展重工业为重点，以创立国家工业化基础的伟大任务，更增加了胜利的信心。
