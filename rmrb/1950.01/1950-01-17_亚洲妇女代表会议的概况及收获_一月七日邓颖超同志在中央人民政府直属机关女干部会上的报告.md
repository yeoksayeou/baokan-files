    Asian Women's Representative Conference Overview and Gains
    ——Comrade Deng Yingchao's Report at the Meeting of Female Cadres Directly Under the Central People's Government on January 7th
            I. Overview of the Asian Women's Representative Conference

    The Asian Women's Representative Conference lasted six days, from December 10th to December 16th, with one day of recess, but the four committees continued to meet as usual. There were a total of 197 delegates and guests, including 23 countries. Among them, 165 were delegates, including 14 countries: the Soviet Socialist Republics in Asia, Mongolia, Korea, China, Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Burma, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Malaya, Siam, and Syria. There were 30 guests, including nine countries: Britain, the United States, France, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Algeria, Cuba, West Africa, and Madagascar. In addition, there were Mrs. Eugénie Cotton, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF), and Ms. Vaillant-Couturier, a member of the WIDF Executive Committee. The delegates and guests represented all strata, all parties, and various types of workers, with the oldest being 71 years old and the youngest 18 years old.

    It is estimated that there were approximately 1,500 to 1,600 observers besides the 463 official observer passes issued. A total of 400 personnel directly served the conference (including the "Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference"), and more than 400 indirectly served.

    There were four main reports at the conference:

    1. "The Struggle of the WIDF for National Independence and Peace" was reported by Mrs. Eugénie Cotton, Secretary-General of the WIDF.

    2. "Asian Women's Struggle for National Independence, People's Democracy, and World Peace" was reported by Deng Yingchao.

    3. "Protecting the Rights of Asian Women" was reported by Ms. Masin Faroughy, the Iranian delegate.

    4. "Protecting the Rights of Children" was reported by Ms. Ammu Swaminadhan, the Indian delegate.

    The conference discussed these four reports and adopted five important resolutions:

    1. Letter to Women Sisters of Asian Countries;

    2. Letter to Women of Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands;

    3. Resolution on the Activities of the WIDF in Assisting Women's Organizations in Asian Countries;

    4. Resolution on Striving for Women's Rights;

    5. Resolution on the Situation of Children in Asian Countries.

    The conference was intense and enthusiastic. Throughout the conference, there were bursts of warm applause and cheers, brimming with international friendship, and many touching scenes appeared. All those who participated in the conference felt that they had received a good internationalist education. Colonial representatives and democratic women representatives from imperialist countries expressed their determination to overthrow the common enemy and seek liberation for mankind without any reservations. They embraced each other for international friendship and class sympathy. In particular, when the French representative and the Vietnamese representative exchanged gifts and embraced each other warmly, the internationalist friendship and enthusiasm deeply moved every delegate in the audience, and many shed tears as a result. Such scenes appeared constantly in the conference, especially when the Soviet representative spoke on the stage. Her words were interrupted several times by warm applause and cheers, which demonstrated the high respect and support of people and women from all countries for the Soviet Union. Although we have various different languages, "Stalin," "Mao Zedong," "Long live," and "Ura" became our common languages. From faces of various different skin colors, we all expressed a common will and determination: to overthrow imperialism, to struggle for national independence, people's democracy, women's liberation, and to strive for lasting world peace. This common will and determination ran through the entire conference.

    The conference seized the time and completed the tasks as scheduled. Because the time was short and pressing, the work seemed heavy and tense. From delegates to working comrades, everyone was actively working hard, even day and night. The spirit of wholeheartedly doing the work well is worth praising.

    At the same time, we also organized many activities outside and after the conference. From December 5th to 25th, the "Exhibition of the Life and Struggle of Asian Women" was held in Zhongshan Park for a total of 20 days. More than 300 units visited, with over 100,000 visitors. The comrades who worked on the exhibition, regardless of fatigue and cold, have been working actively and diligently to complete their tasks. The exhibition had a great impact, as can be seen from the number of visitors and their feedback. In addition, we also organized delegates from various countries to visit Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places to see industrial and cultural construction. In Beijing and Shanghai, we also organized them to give reports in factories and schools. The foreign delegates were very happy and satisfied with the visit to Shanghai, because Shanghai had made preparations in advance, with planned and organized activities. Mayor Chen Yi gave them a report on the experience of taking over Shanghai, and the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions gave a briefing on the heroic struggle of Shanghai workers in protecting factories and the current situation of active production and construction. The delegates were very interested and needed to hear such political activities and reports on Chinese issues and various tasks, because this could help them better understand the Chinese revolution and get closer to the Chinese masses. The Northeast Women's Federation made great efforts in welcoming and sending off delegates from various countries and summarized its work experience.

    The Asian Women's Representative Conference was convened after a considerable period of time and a tortuous process. Mrs. Eugénie Cotton pointed out in her report that the conference was "achieved through 18 months of effort and painstaking management," and after more than four months of preparation. 18 months ago, the WIDF decided to convene this conference in the East in 1948, and decided to hold it in India in October 1948, but it was rejected by the reactionary Nehru government of India and did not take place. At the Second International Women's Congress in December of the same year, it was decided to change the venue to China. Now that this conference can be successfully convened and successfully concluded in the capital of New China – Beijing, in addition to the efforts of the WIDF and sisters from Asian countries, the most important condition is the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution, so the conference can be successfully convened and successfully concluded. This is inseparable from the victorious situation of the Chinese revolution.

    This conference has attracted the attention and importance of all parties in the world and has had a great impact. The first is the joy and congratulations of the organized sisters in various countries in the world democratic women's camp, their enthusiasm for the conference, and the attention of the people of various countries, as can be seen from the congratulatory messages received by the conference from various domestic and foreign organizations: 75 telegrams from foreign organizations and 158 congratulatory telegrams from various parts of China. In particular, the socialist country – the Soviet Union – attached great importance to it and wrote an editorial in the Pravda on the Asian Women's Representative Conference. In China, local newspapers not only reported a lot about the activities of this conference, but also had commentaries and features. At the same time, it also had an impact in the enemy's camp: because our conference is a conference for Asian women and world women to unite and demonstrate to imperialism around the world, it made U.S. imperialism and the reactionary governments of Asian countries feel more threatened. Because this conference will make the struggle of Asian women develop more forcefully under a unified policy, and increase the strength of the struggle of the Asian people and the people of the world, it has attracted the attention of all parties. (⑴⑶)

            II. Evaluation of the Asian Women's Representative Conference

    The Asian Women's Representative Conference determined the direction and tasks of the Asian women's movement, and determined different specific tasks according to three types of countries.

    A. This conference was basically successful and "completed our work with rich gains" (see Mrs. Eugénie Cotton's closing remarks). Its success and gains are many, mainly manifested in the following aspects:

    (1) The direction and tasks of the Asian women's movement have been determined.

    The direction and task of the Asian women's liberation movement is: "Asian women, regardless of nationality, class, or religious belief, unite and unite with the people of all countries – all those who oppose imperialism and its running dogs – to form a broad national united front to oppose the common enemy imperialism and struggle for national independence and people's democracy. Unity is strength, and it is the guarantee of defeating imperialism and reactionary forces." The conference also pointed out: The liberation of Asian women is inseparable from the liberation of the nation. Therefore, if Asian women want to be liberated, to have equal rights, and for their children to be protected, and to have a good and happy life, then women must first fight for national independence and people's democracy. Only by overthrowing imperialism, destroying feudal forces, and realizing national independence and people's democracy can women's liberation be achieved. Therefore, the women's movement is part of the national liberation and people's democratic movement. If the women's movement in Asian countries deviates from the national liberation movement and people's democratic movement of each country and only strives for the partial rights of women and protects the rights of children alone, it will not only have no results, but will also make mistakes. The process experienced by the Chinese women's movement has taken detours and had painful experiences and lessons. After the "May Fourth" Movement in 1919, there was a movement that demanded women's rights alone under the premise of recognizing the status quo of the reactionary rulers at that time. It was like a flash in the pan and had no results. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, isolated women's movements also occurred in some base areas, emphasizing the partial interests of women and separating the women's movement from the entire national struggle; although it was not long before it was corrected, experience proved that it was also a detour. We must recognize that the liberation of women is inseparable from the liberation of the nation, the people, and society. At the same time, the liberation of women is also a measure of the liberation of the nation, the people, and society. Therefore, the direction and tasks of the Asian women's movement are also formulated according to the direction and tasks of the national liberation movement and the struggle for people's democracy in Asian countries. Under the general direction and tasks of the Asian women's movement, the conference also proposed different specific tasks according to the three different types of Asian countries:

    The first type: countries where the revolution has been victorious, which drove away imperialism a long time ago or recently, ended the rule of imperialism and reactionary forces, some of which have long implemented the socialist system, and some of which have established people's democratic regimes, such as the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and China. The central task of women in these countries is mainly to participate in construction with redoubled efforts, increase production, carry out cultural and educational work, and improve their production and cultural levels. They must be with the people of their countries to consolidate the gains, defend world peace, and strive for a better future. In particular, Soviet women must further consolidate the strength of their motherland and defend the bastion of world peace and democracy.

    The second type: countries where there are two regions, two regimes, and two systems. On the one hand, the people's struggle has achieved victory in part or most of the regions, and people's regimes have been established, such as in northern Korea and most of Vietnam. In countries such as Burma, Malaya, and Indonesia, their people's armed forces are carrying out armed struggles against anti-people forces; but on the other hand, in some areas there are still reactionary puppet governments controlled by imperialism, or they are still ruled by colonial governments of imperialism, which use all means to suppress the people's revolutionary struggle and deprive the people of all rights. People's revolutionary movements and their leaders are cruelly destroyed, and revolutionaries, regardless of men or women, are arrested and killed in large numbers, such as in southern Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Burma, and Malaya. In these countries, the task of women is, on the one hand, to continue the fearless struggle against imperialism, to fully support and support the sacred national liberation war of their people, to drive the invaders out of the country, and to fight for the independence and people's democracy of their motherland, and to abolish all privileges of foreign imperialists in the country; but on the other hand, women in the areas still ruled by the enemy must expose the essence of the colonial regime, expose the collusion between the reactionary government of their country and imperialism, and the traitorous behavior of betraying national independence. To fight for the daily economic, political, and social interests of women, accumulate strength, wait for the opportunity, and cooperate with the people's armed struggle and its development. These are two different struggle tasks in two different regions.

    The third type: countries that are completely under the rule of imperialism and reactionaries, such as India, Iran, and Japan. Women in these countries must adopt various organizational forms according to the specific conditions at that time and place to prepare strength. Activists should participate in all mass organizations to organize and educate the masses of women to fight to defend their vital interests. In particular, Japanese women must oppose the preparation for a new war in the struggle for national independence and people's democracy. Oppose the revival of fascist forces by U.S. imperialism; while women in Iran, Syria, and other countries, in addition to fighting for national independence and people's democracy, should also oppose imperialism and oppose turning their country into a war instigator, and strive against using them as military bases to attack the Soviet Union, the bastion of world peace.

    Although the specific conditions in these three types of countries are different and the specific tasks are different, armed struggle has become or will become the main form of the people's struggle in some countries. For example, China has been carrying out anti-people armed struggle with the people's armed forces for a long time. The Chinese people have achieved a great victory in the country today. Without China's long-term armed struggle of more than 20 years and its development and victory, it would not have been possible to drive away imperialism and overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. In addition, armed struggles are currently underway in Vietnam, Burma, Indonesia, Malaya, Korea, and the Philippines. This form of armed struggle is increasingly becoming a major form of struggle for the oppressed people of Asia to strive for national independence and people's democracy and to defend lasting world peace. Although armed struggles have not yet occurred in the third type of countries today, they will inevitably occur and take the road of armed struggle once the time is ripe and possible. Because for imperialism and puppet governments and reactionaries who use armed forces to suppress the people, the people can only use armed forces to implement self-defense, otherwise they will only be suppressed underground and become obedient slaves. Developing armed struggle in Asia and using the just and sacred national liberation war to eliminate the unjust war of aggression is the main form for the oppressed nations of Asia to strive for peace and achieve lasting peace and defend world peace. This is mutually coordinated and unified with the movements of people in other countries in the world to oppose a new world war, prevent the outbreak of war, call for peace, and defend peace, and it is not divided and contradictory.

    The issue of establishing an Asian women's organization has been decided in principle.

    (2) On the issue of establishing an organization: Only a principle decision was made at the conference: "Please the WIDF to make preparations to establish an organization in Asia to strengthen the organization of women in Asian countries and make their relationship with the WIDF closer." (See the Resolution on the Activities of the WIDF in Assisting Women's Organizations in Asian Countries)

    As for the specific solution, we will have to wait for the development of objective and subjective situations and have some possible conditions before taking specific steps.

    The conference was a conference of great solidarity of Asian women, and they all received a profound internationalist education.

    (3) Strengthened the unity of Asian countries and world women, and gave them a profound internationalist education. This conference was the first major gathering of Asian women and a conference of great solidarity. It strengthened the unity of Asian women and the unity of world women. At the conference, representatives from various countries exchanged information and experiences on the struggles of their respective countries, increased mutual understanding, strengthened the friendship of international sisters, and strengthened mutual ties. Although the representatives came from various countries, had different languages, and different lifestyles, we did not understand each other in the past. But because of this conference, we all received a profound internationalist education, thereby improving the spirit of internationalism and strengthening the sense of mutual responsibility. For example, when foreign delegates had not yet arrived in China and Beijing, they could not have imagined that the Chinese people, who had been in war for many years, could treat them so generously. After they arrived in China, they saw the new atmosphere of New China, felt the strength of China, and at the same time had a further understanding of China's national conditions. For example, after they came into contact with Chinese representatives, they felt that Chinese women were the most enthusiastic. One foreign delegate said: "The more I stay in China, the more I feel that Chinese women are more enthusiastic." And they also recognized the organizational ability of Chinese women from the situation of this conference. Similarly, Chinese representatives also knew the ideological dynamics of foreign representatives, had a better understanding of foreign representatives, and knew what kind of country their country was and distinguished between the enemy, the us and our friends. Due to mutual help and understanding, we all left a deep impression on each other.

    In terms of promoting the spirit of internationalism, we saw and experienced more vividly that, whether in discussions, meetings, or exchanging gifts, foreign representatives all said in unison: "The victory of the Chinese people's revolution is our victory." Chinese representatives also said: "The victory of our revolution is your victory, and your victory is also our victory." "Although China has been liberated, thousands of women in Asia are still being oppressed and suffering. I must work hard to do women's work. If I am sent to Southeast Asia, I will go to work anywhere." Indeed, the victory of the people of the world has no borders.

    This conference improved the political consciousness of the representatives, strengthened the internationalist education of the representatives, and unanimously believed that the liberation cause of Asia and the people of the world is our common responsibility, so that we concretely realized that our team is strong and our struggle is not isolated. We must unite and fight together under a common goal.

    At this conference, the Soviet representative received exceptionally warm support and welcome, which was not accidental, but because the Soviet Union demonstrated its strong strength and made the greatest contribution to the cause of world peace and human liberation, and played a leading role.

    The victory of the Chinese revolution enhanced China's international status and the international status of Chinese women. At the conference, Chinese representatives introduced the main experiences of the Chinese revolution.

    (4) The victory of the Chinese revolution unprecedentedly enhanced China's international status and was respected and valued by delegates from various countries, thereby also enhancing the international status of Chinese women. The heroic struggle of the Chinese people and Chinese women was universally praised by them. At the same time, the victory of the Chinese revolution also gave them great encouragement, especially to the people of Asian countries, and Chinese women also received great encouragement from them. In the speeches of every foreign delegate, they were full of respect and love for Chairman Mao. They gave their most precious gifts to Chairman Mao and Chinese women. The Indian representative said: "Because of your victory, our victory is closer." At the conference, we also provided them with the experience of the Chinese revolution, the most important of which are three points:

    First, the leadership of the Communist Party, with a Chinese Communist Party armed with Marxist-Leninist theory and closely linked to the masses.

    Second, armed struggle, using the armed people to overthrow the armed counter-revolution.

    Third, the establishment of a broad national democratic united front.

    These are the indispensable basic conditions for our victory. These experiences can be applied to many colonial and semi-colonial countries.

    Increased awareness of the importance of women's work and children's work, and also increased the Chinese delegates' awareness of childcare work.

    (5) Increased awareness of women's work and children's work. Some of the Chinese representatives made self-criticism in group discussions. This conference increased their awareness and consciousness, making them aware of the importance of women's work, and recognizing that in addition to the Soviet Union and China, there are thousands of women in Asia who need our help to strive for class and national liberation; they recognized that they need and should organize and inspire the vast masses of women to fight against imperialism and reactionaries in order to obtain the liberation of the masses of women and the people; they recognized their own responsibilities, recognized the nature of women's work; and recognized that women's work is their own work, not like in the past, when they felt that women's work was only the work of the women's federation, which could be done or not. Therefore, they said: "We must seriously do women's work when we go back." Indeed, if women want to be liberated, they must liberate themselves, not rely on other people's gifts. We must carry out arduous work among the vast masses of women, actively work hard, work hard, and improve their awareness and level, so as to become a more powerful organization.

    In addition, the Asian Women's Representative Conference also increased the Chinese delegates' awareness of childcare work. In the reports and speeches of the WIDF and delegates from various countries, they all mentioned the need to protect the rights of children, to protect the next generation, and to strive for a better life and a bright future for the next generation, and everywhere showed their great maternal love for children, thereby increasing the Chinese delegates' emphasis on children's welfare. "In the past, I thought that I only needed to be a good female cadre, and I didn't need to be a good mother." Now I realize that to be a good working cadre, I must also be a good mother. This reduces the conflict between work and children and increases the unity of the two.

    The gains and influence of the Asian Women's Representative Conference are very broad.

    B. But our conference is not without shortcomings and difficulties. Our shortcomings are: 1. Due to time and language issues, the exchange of ideas is still lacking; 2. The efficiency of some work is still poor, and the organization of work and the clarity of division of labor are not enough; 3. Larger individual technical negligence in the work.

    The difficulty of our work is the lack of experience. This is the first time for such an international conference, and difficulties have arisen due to new affairs. In addition, there are difficulties such as poor language, text, and technical conditions, especially the lack of translation manpower.

    The conference was successful, but with the end of the conference, even more important and arduous tasks are unfolding before us. We need to continue to work hard to implement the resolutions.

    亚洲妇女代表会议的概况及收获
    ——一月七日邓颖超同志在中央人民政府直属机关女干部会上的报告
            一  亚洲妇女代表会议的概况
    亚洲妇女代表会议共开了六天，从十二月十日开始，到十六日结束，其中休会一天，但四个委员会仍照常开会。到会代表和来宾共有一百九十七人，包括二十三个国家，其中代表占一百六十五人，包括十四个国家，即苏联在亚洲社会主义共和国、蒙古、朝鲜、中国、印尼、印度、越南、缅甸、伊朗、以色列、黎巴嫩、马来亚、暹罗、叙利亚等，来宾共有三十人，包括九个国家，即英国、美国、法国、捷克、荷兰、阿尔及利亚、古巴、西非、马达加斯加等，此外有国际民主妇联总书记古久里夫人及该会执行委员凡尔米什等二人。代表及来宾，包括各阶层，各党派，各种工作者，年龄最大者七十一岁，最小的十八岁。
    鉴于旁听者除正式发了旁听证四百六十三张外，还有临时旁听的共有一千五百至一千六百人左右。此次直接为大会服务的工作人员（包括“亚澳工会会议”），共有四百人，间接服务的也在四百人以上。
    在大会上主要报告有四个：
    １、“国际民主妇联为民族独立与和平的斗争”由国际民主妇联总书记古久里夫人报告。
    ２、“亚洲妇女为民族独立人民民主与世界和平而斗争”由邓颖超报告。
    ３、“保护亚洲妇女权利”的报告是由伊朗代表玛辛·法洛琪作的。
    ４、“保护儿童权利”的报告是由印度代表阿米塔·台维作的。
    大会对这四个报告均作了讨论，并通过了五个重要决议：
    １、致亚洲各国妇女姊妹书；
    ２、告英、美、法、荷妇女书；
    ３、关于国际民主妇联援助亚洲国家的妇女团体之活动的决议；
    ４、关于争取妇女权利的决议；
    ５、关于亚洲各国儿童情况的决议。
    这次会议的进行是紧张的、热烈的。会议始终贯串着一阵阵热烈的掌声和尽情的欢呼，洋溢着国际的友情，出现了很多感人的场面，参加了会议的人都感到是受了一次很好的国际主义的教育。在殖民地代表及帝国主义国家中的民主妇女代表之间，毫无隔膜地表示了为打倒共同的敌人和为人类求解放的决心。她们为国际的友爱和阶级的同情而拥抱，特别是法国代表和越南代表互相赠送礼物，热烈地拥抱时，那种国际主义的友爱和热情，使全场每个代表都深为感动，很多人因而流泪。这样的场面在大会中不断出现着，尤其是当苏联代表到台上讲话时，她的话声几次都被热烈的鼓掌声和欢呼声所打断，这表现了各国人民及妇女对苏联的高度的崇爱和拥护。我们虽有各种不同的语言，但“斯大林”、“毛泽东”、“万岁”、“乌拉”成了我们共同的语言。我们从各种不同的肤色的脸上，都表现了共同的意志和决心，即是要打倒帝国主义，为民族独立、人民民主、妇女解放、争取世界持久和平而斗争。这种共同的意志和决心贯穿在整个会议中。
    会议抓紧了时间，如期完成，因为时间很短而迫促，所以工作显得烦重而紧张，从代表到工作同志，都在积极努力，甚至日以继夜紧张地工作着。那种一心一意要把工作作好的精神，是值得我们表扬的。
    我们同时还组织了许多会外会后的活动。从十二月五日到二十五日，在中山公园举行了“亚洲妇女生活与斗争展览会”，共展览了二十天，参观的单位有三百多，观众在十万人以上。展览会工作的同志，不知疲劳，不怕寒冷，一直积极努力工作，完成了任务。展览会的影响很大，从参观者的人数和意见的反映上，可以看出。另外，我们还组织了各国代表到天津、上海等地去参观工业及文物建设，在北京、上海并组织她们到工厂、学校去作报告。外国代表都很高兴，对于到上海的参观，很满意；因为上海事前是做了准备，有计划，有组织进行。陈毅市长向她们作了接管上海经验的报告，上海总工会作了上海工人护厂的英勇奋斗与目前积极生产建设的情况的介绍。代表们对这种政治性的活动，听取中国问题及各种工作报告感到非常大的兴趣和需要，因为这可以帮助她们更多地了解中国的革命，和接近中国的群众。东北妇联对迎送各国代表作了很大的努力，并总结了工作经验。
    亚洲妇女代表会议是经过相当长的时间和曲折的过程才开成的。古久里夫人在报告中即曾指出这个会议是“经过十八个月的努力并苦心经营”，又经过四个多月的筹备才实现的。在十八个月以前国际民主妇联即决定要在一九四八年内在东方召开这个会议，并决定一九四八年十月在印度举行，但是遭到了印度尼赫鲁反动政府的拒绝，没有开成。在同年十二月第二届国际妇女代表大会上决定改在中国召开。现在这个会议能在新中国的首都——北京召开，除了国际民主妇联及亚洲各国姊妹们的努力以外，最主要的条件是由于中国人民革命的大胜利，所以会议能胜利地召开并完满地结束，这是与中国革命的胜利形势分不开的。
    这个会议引起了世界各方面的注意和重视，发生了很大的影响。首先是世界民主妇女阵营中的各国有组织的姊妹们的欢欣祝贺、对大会的热望、以及各国人民的注意，这可从大会所收到的国内外各团体的贺电中看出：国外团体来电七十五份，中国各地贺电有一百五十八份。特别是社会主义国家——苏联很重视，在真理报上写了对亚洲妇女代表会议的社评。而在中国国内各地的报纸，不仅报道了很多关于这个会议的活动，并有评论及特写。同时，它在敌人的阵营里，也同样发生了影响：由于我们这个会议，是亚洲妇女和世界妇女团结起来，向全世界帝国主义示威的会议，特别使美帝国主义和亚洲各国的反动政府更感到了威胁。因为这个会议，将使亚洲妇女的斗争，在统一的方针之下，更有力地向前发展，并增进着亚洲人民以及世界人民斗争的力量，所以引起了各方面的重视。（⑴⑶）
            二  对亚洲妇女代表会议的估价
    亚洲妇女代表会议，确定了亚洲妇女运动的方针和任务，并根据三种类型的国家，确定了不同的具体任务。
    甲、这个会议，基本上是成功的，“完成了我们有丰富收获的工作”（见古久里夫人闭幕词），它的成功和收获很多，主要表现在以下几点：
    （一）确定了亚洲妇女运动的方针和任务。
    亚洲妇女解放运动的方针和任务是：“亚洲妇女不分民族，不分阶层，不分宗教信仰地团结起来，并和各国人民——一切反对帝国主义及其走狗的人们——团结起来，组成广大的民族统一战线，反对共同的敌人帝国主义，为民族独立与人民民主而斗争。团结就是力量，就是战胜帝国主义和反动势力的保证。”会议同时又指出：亚洲各国妇女的解放是和民族的解放分不开的。因此，亚洲各国妇女要得到解放，要得到平等的权利以及孩子们能够受到保护，又能有一个美好幸福的生活，那么妇女首先就必须要为民族独立，为人民民主而奋斗。只有在打倒帝国主义，摧毁了封建势力，实现了民族的独立和人民的民主之后，才能达到妇女的解放。所以妇女运动是民族解放及人民民主运动的一部分。如果亚洲各国的妇女运动，脱离了各国的民族解放运动和人民民主运动，只单独地去争取妇女局部的权利，和保卫儿童的权利，那不但没有结果，而要犯错误的。中国妇女运动所经历的过程，是曾经走过弯路、有过痛苦的经验教训的。在一九一九年“五四”运动之后，曾经有过在承认当时反动统治者的现状之下单独要求女权的运动，是像昙花一现，而毫无结果。又如在抗战初期，在某些根据地亦发生过孤立的妇女运动，强调妇女的局部利益，使妇女运动与整个民族的斗争分离；虽然为时不久，被纠正了，但经验证明亦是走了弯路。我们必须认识妇女的解放是和民族的、人民的、社会的解放分不开的。同时妇女的解放又是测量民族的、人民的、社会的解放的尺度。所以亚洲妇女运动的方针和任务亦是根据亚洲各国民族解放运动、争取人民民主的方针和任务来制定的。会议在亚洲妇女运动总的方针和任务之下，同时又根据亚洲三种不同类型的国家，提出了不同的具体任务：
    第一类：即革命已经取得胜利的国家，在很久以前或在最近已赶走了帝国主义，结束了帝国主义及反动势力的统治，有的早实行了社会主义的制度，有的建立了人民民主的政权。如苏联、蒙古和中国，这些国家妇女的中心任务主要是用百倍的努力参加建设，增加生产，开展文教工作，以及提高生产及文化水平。她们要和本国人民在一起，为巩固已得的胜利，保卫世界和平和争取更美好的将来而奋斗，特别是苏联妇女，要进一步地巩固祖国的力量，保卫世界和平民主的堡垒。
    第二类：是存在着两种地区，两种政权，和两种制度的国家，一方面人民斗争在部分或大部分地区，取得了胜利，建立了人民的政权，如朝鲜北部，越南大部，在缅甸、马来亚、印尼等国，他们人民的武装正在进行反对反人民的武装斗争；但另一方面同时在部分地区还存在着帝国主义控制下的反动的傀儡政府，或还在帝国主义的殖民地政府统治着，他们用一切办法来镇压人民的革命斗争，剥夺了人民的一切权利。人民革命运动及其领袖受到残酷的摧残，革命分子不分男女，大批被捕、被杀，如朝鲜南部、越南、印尼、缅甸和马来亚。在这些国家，妇女的任务是一方面继续反抗帝国主义的奋不顾身的斗争，用全力来拥护并支援本国人民的神圣的民族的解放战争，把侵略者驱逐出国境为争取自己祖国的独立与人民民主，取消外国帝国主义者在国内的一切特权而奋斗；但在另一方面，还在敌人统治地区的妇女，则要揭穿殖民地政权的本质，揭穿本国反动政府和帝国主义勾结，背叛民族独立的卖国行为。为妇女一切日常经济的、政治的、社会的利益而斗争，储蓄力量，等待时机，配合人民的武装斗争及其发展。这是在两种不同地区的两种不同的斗争任务。
    第三类：完全处在帝国主义和反动派统治下的国家，如印度、伊朗、日本等。在这些国家的妇女们要按照当时当地的具体情况，采用各种各样的组织形式，准备力量。积极分子要参加到一切有群众的团体中去，组织和教育妇女群众为保卫她们的切身利益而斗争。特别是日本的妇女为争取民族独立及人民民主斗争中，尤其要反对新的战争的准备。反对美帝国主义扶持法西斯势力的复活；而伊朗、叙利亚等国的妇女除了为民族独立、争取人民民主而斗争外，更应反对帝国主义和反对把自己的国家成为战争挑拨者，以攻击保卫世界和平堡垒苏联的军事基地而奋斗。
    这三类国家的具体情况虽各有不同，具体任务虽各有区别，但武装斗争却已经成为或将要成为某些国家人民斗争的主要形式。如中国就是长期以人民的武装进行着反人民武装的斗争，中国人民今天已在全国范围内取得了伟大的胜利，中国如果没有二十多年来的长期的武装斗争及其发展与胜利，就不可能赶走了帝国主义及推翻国民党的反动统治。另外如越南、缅甸、印尼、马来亚、朝鲜、菲律宾目前都已经在进行着武装斗争。这种武装斗争形式，正在日益成为亚洲被压迫人民为争取民族独立与人民民主以及保卫世界持久和平的一种主要斗争形式。虽然在第三类国家中他们今天尚未发生武装斗争，但他们在一旦时机成熟和可能的情况下，必将发生武装斗争，走向武装斗争的道路。因为对于用武装来镇压人民的帝国主义及傀儡政府和反动派，人民也只有用武装来实行自卫，否则只有被压在地下，做训服的奴隶。在亚洲发展武装斗争，用正义的神圣的民族解放战争去消灭非正义的侵略战争，即是亚洲被压迫民族争取和平与达到持久和平以及保卫世界和平的主要形式。这与世界上其他国家人民反对新的世界大战、阻止战争的爆发、呼吁和平、保卫和平的运动，是互相配合统一的，不是分割矛盾的。
     关于建立亚洲妇女组织问题，已作原则性决定。
    （二）关于建立组织问题：在大会上只作了原则性的决定：“请国际民主妇联进行筹备，在亚洲建立一个机构，来加强亚洲各国妇女的组织并使她们与国际民主妇联之间的关系，更加密切起来。”（见关于国际民主妇联援助亚洲国家妇女团体活动的决议）
    至于具体解决，还有待于主客观的情况发展及具备一些可能条件的时候，再采取具体的步骤。
    会议是亚洲妇女大团结的会议，彼此都受到了深刻的国际主义教育。
    （三）加强了亚洲各国和世界妇女的团结，使她们受到了深刻的国际主义的教育。这次会议是亚洲各国妇女第一次的大汇合，是一个大团结的会议，它加强了亚洲妇女的团结和世界妇女的团结。在会议中，各国代表交换了各国斗争的情况及经验，增进了相互间的了解，加强了国际姊妹们的友谊，密切了相互间的联系。代表们虽是来自各个国家，有不同的语言，不同的生活习惯，过去我们彼此都不了解，但由于这次会议，彼此都受到了深刻的国际主义的教育，从而提高了国际主义的精神，加强了互助的责任感。比如当外国代表还没有到达中国和北京的时候，她们想不到在多年战争中的中国人民还能对她们进行如此丰盛的接待。她们到中国以后，看到人民新中国的新气象，体会到中国的力量，同时对中国国情也有了进一步的了解，比如她们在与中国代表接触以后，觉得中国妇女是最热情的。有一个外国代表说：“多在中国留一天，就越觉得中国妇女更热情。”并且她们从这次大会的情况上也认识了中国妇女的组织能力。同样中国代表也知道了外国代表的思想动态，对外国代表有了更多的了解，知道了她们的国家是怎样性质的一个国家，分清了敌我友。由于相互的帮助和了解，彼此都留下了深刻的印象。
    在发扬国际主义的精神方面，我们更活生生的看到与体会到，不论在讨论、开会与交换礼物之间，外国代表都异口同声地说：“中国人民革命的胜利，便是我们的胜利。”中国代表也说：“我们革命的胜利就是你们的胜利，你们的胜利亦是我们的胜利。”“中国虽然已得到解放，但亚洲千千万万的妇女还在受着压迫和痛苦，我一定要努力作妇女工作，如把我派到东南亚，任何地方去工作，我一定去。”真是世界人民的胜利是无国界的。
    这个会议提高了代表们的政治觉悟，加强了对代表们的国际主义教育，一致认为亚洲以及全世界人民的解放事业是我们共同的责任，使我们具体体会到我们的队伍是强大的，我们的斗争不是孤立的。我们必须在共同的目标下团结起来，共同奋斗。
    在这次大会上苏联代表受到异常热烈地拥护和欢迎并不是偶然的，乃是由于苏联在世界和平及人类解放的事业上表现了她坚强的力量和最大的贡献，并起了领导作用。
    中国革命的胜利，提高了中国国际地位，提高了中国妇女的国际地位。大会上，中国代表介绍了中国革命的主要经验。
    （四）中国革命的胜利空前提高了中国国际地位，受到了各国代表的尊敬和重视，从而也提高了中国妇女的国际地位。中国人民与中国妇女的英勇斗争，普遍地受到了她们的赞扬。同时，中国革命的胜利也给予她们很大的鼓励，特别是对亚洲各国人民的鼓励更大，同样中国妇女亦受到她们很大的鼓励。在每个外国代表的发言里都充满了对毛主席的尊崇和热爱。她们把自己最珍贵的礼物送给毛主席，送给中国妇女。印度代表说：“由于你们的胜利，使我们的胜利更接近了。”在大会中我们并向她们提供了中国革命取得胜利的经验，最主要的有三点：
    第一、共产党的领导，有了一个为马列主义理论所武装的并且密切联系群众的中国共产党。
    第二、武装斗争，以武装的人民打倒了武装的反革命。
    第三、建立了广泛的民族民主的统一战线。
    这是我们得到胜利的不可缺少的基本条件。这些经验，是可运用于许多殖民地半殖民地国家的。
    提高了对于妇女工作、儿童工作重要性的认识，同时提高了中国代表们对儿童保育工作的认识。
    （五）提高了对妇女工作、儿童工作的认识。中国代表中有些人在小组讨论中作了自我检讨，这次大会提高了她们的认识和觉悟，使她们认识了妇女工作的重要性，认识了除苏联、中国以外，在亚洲还有千千万万的妇女需要我们的帮助，去争取阶级的民族的解放；认识了自己需要而且应该去组织与启发广大的妇女群众起来向帝国主义、向反动派作斗争，以求得妇女群众和人民的解放；认识了自己的责任，认识了妇女工作的性质；认识了妇女工作是她们自己应做的工作，不是像过去一样，觉得妇女工作只是妇联会的工作，可做可不做的。因此，她们说：“我们回去一定要认真的做好妇女工作。”的确，妇女要想求得解放，必须自己起来解放自己，不是靠别人恩赐。我们必须在广大妇女群众中进行艰苦的工作，积极努力，埋头苦干，提高她们的觉悟和水平，成为更有力量的组织。
    此外，亚洲妇女代表会议同时也提高了中国代表们对儿童保育工作的认识。国际妇联及各国代表的报告及发言中，都提到了要保护儿童的权利，要保护后一代，为后一代美好的生活和光明的前途而奋斗，随处表现了她们热爱孩子们的伟大母性，因而提高了中国代表们对儿童福利的重视。“过去以为只要做一个工作好的女干部，不必要做一个好母亲。”现在认识了要做一个好的工作干部，亦要做一个好的母亲。这就减弱了对工作与孩子的矛盾，增加了两者的统一性。
    亚洲妇女代表会议的收获及其影响，是很宽广的。
    乙、但我们的会议不是没有缺点和困难的，我们的缺点是：一、由于时间与语言的关系，思想的交流还有缺欠；二、某些工作的效率还差，工作的组织性和分工的明确性不够；三、工作中较大的个别技术的疏忽。
    我们工作的困难是缺乏经验，像这样国际性的会议还是第一次，由于新的事务引起了困难。另外则是语言、文字及技术条件差，特别是翻译人力的不够等困难。
    会议是成功的，但随着会议的结束，展开在我们面前的是更重大艰巨的任务，我们需要继续为实现决议而努力奋斗。
