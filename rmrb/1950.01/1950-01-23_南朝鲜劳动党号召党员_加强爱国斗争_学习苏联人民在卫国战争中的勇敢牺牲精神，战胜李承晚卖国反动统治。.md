    South Korean Workers' Party Calls on Members to Strengthen Patriotic Struggle
    Learn from the Soviet People's Brave and Sacrificial Spirit in the Great Patriotic War and Overcome the Traitorous and Reactionary Rule of Syngman Rhee.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd] The Nodong Sinmun here published a letter from the Central Committee of the South Korean Workers' Party to all party members on December 27th of last year. The letter pointed out that the Syngman Rhee gang's reactionary rule of betraying the country and slaughtering the people has aroused the anger of all the people, who have risen up to participate in the patriotic struggle. However, the more the people's patriotic struggle rises, the more the Syngman Rhee gang tries to undermine the unity of the democratic camp. In particular, in order to weaken the vanguard of the working masses—the South Korean Workers' Party—Syngman Rhee has adopted despicable divisive conspiracies. As pointed out in the resolution of the Third Meeting of the Communist Information Bureau, "buying spies and traitors in the ranks of the workers' parties is an old trick of the bourgeoisie." But the fact that the Syngman Rhee gang has adopted this method shows that it is already completely isolated among the people and the moment of its demise is approaching.
    The letter to party members went on to point out: In the course of the struggle, there will undoubtedly be many difficulties. But these difficulties cannot be overcome. We should learn from the bravery and self-sacrificing spirit displayed by the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War, uphold the honor of the Labor Party member under the banner of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and complete our tasks.

    南朝鲜劳动党号召党员
    加强爱国斗争
    学习苏联人民在卫国战争中的勇敢牺牲精神，战胜李承晚卖国反动统治。
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】此间劳动新闻报顷刊载南朝鲜劳动党中央委员会去年十二月二十七日发表的告南朝鲜劳动党全体党员书。书中指出：李承晚匪帮出卖祖国屠杀人民的反动统治，已招致全体人民的愤怒并起而参加爱国斗争。但是，人民的爱国斗争愈高涨，李承晚匪帮就愈图破坏民主阵营的团结。特别是为了削弱劳动大众的先锋队——南朝鲜劳动党，李承晚更采取了卑鄙的分裂阴谋。正像共产党情报局第三次会议的决议中所指出的，“在工人阶级政党的队伍里收买间谍和奸细，这是资产阶级的老办法”。但李承晚匪帮之采取这种办法，正是说明它已经在人民中完全陷于孤立、灭亡的时刻益趋迫近的缘故。
    告党员书继而指出：在斗争过程中，无疑将有许多困难。但这些困难没有不能克服的。我们应该学习苏联人民在卫国战争中所发挥的勇敢与自我牺牲精神，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的旗帜下，坚守劳动党员的荣誉，完成自己的任务。
