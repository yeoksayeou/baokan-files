Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th - According to a report from Diantong News Agency, Havana, January 11th: The news that the Argentine Perón government recently closed the "Times" and "Trends" newspapers, sponsored by the Argentine Communist Party, has aroused widespread protests from Cuban democrats. Both newspapers were ordered to be closed by the so-called "Congressional Committee on Un-Argentine Activities." The real reason for closing the two newspapers is that they exposed the dictatorship and unconstitutionality of the Perón government, and exposed the various tortures, assassinations, and attacks it has inflicted on the Argentine people.

    Vilela and Del, the editors of "Times," condemned Perón's fascist actions, saying, "This action is arbitrary and illegal." At the same time, this action is also intended to "silence the voices of the workers." Marinello, Chairman of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, and Roca, General Secretary, sent a telegram of protest to Perón on behalf of the party. The telegram, in the name of the democratic people of Cuba, condemned the Perón fascist government for closing newspapers and strongly protested against its murder of Argentine labor leader Aigui (killed in December last year) and other acts of persecution.

    裴隆非法封闭阿共报纸
    古巴人民提出抗议
    【新华社北京十六日电】据电通社哈瓦那十一日讯：阿根廷裴隆政府最近封闭阿根廷共产党主办的《时报》和《趋向》报的消息传抵此间后，引起了古巴民主人士的广泛抗议。这两家报纸都是被所谓“国会非阿根廷活动委员会”下令封闭的。封闭两报的真正原因，是由于它们暴露了裴隆政府的独裁和违宪，暴露了它对阿根廷人民所施的各种酷刑、暗杀和进攻。
    《时报》的编辑维莱拉和德尔谴责裴隆的法西斯行动说：“此种行动是专横的和非法的。”同时，这种行动也是想要“封塞工人们的声音”。古巴人民社会党主席马利涅洛和总书记罗加代表该党向裴隆发出抗议的电报。电报以古巴民主人民的名义谴责裴隆法西斯政府封闭报纸，并对它残杀阿根廷工人领袖艾桂（按在去年十二月间被杀害）和其他迫害行动提出强烈抗议。
