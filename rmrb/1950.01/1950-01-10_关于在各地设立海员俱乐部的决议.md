    Resolution on Establishing Seafarer's Clubs in Various Regions
    (Passed by the National Representative Conference of Seafarer's Unions on December 26, 1949
    Approved by the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on January 5, 1950)
    I. The National Representative Conference of Seafarer's Unions believes that establishing seafarer's clubs plays a significant role in organizing and uniting the mobile and often unsettled seafaring workers, providing cultural education, regulating their lives, fostering emotional bonds, and resolving various difficulties, especially in connecting and uniting international seafarers. Therefore, establishing seafarer's clubs should become an important work content for seafarer's unions in various regions.
    II. The implementation steps should be based on the specific conditions of the funds and cadres of seafarer's unions in various regions, adopting a gradual approach from small to large, from simple to enriched, and from major to secondary locations. Places with a large number of seafarers and significant influence, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, should be prioritized.
    III. Seafarer's clubs must be located near ports and docks where ships congregate.
    IV. The premises for seafarer's clubs shall be requested by local seafarer's unions from the local government.
    V. The initial expenses of seafarer's clubs mainly rely on fundraising by members of the seafarer's union, mobilizing the seafarer masses to manage it themselves. However, local governments may be requested to provide subsidies when necessary. The operating expenses of the clubs should utilize the club's location and facilities, charging appropriate fees to gradually achieve self-sufficiency.
    VI. Seafarer's unions in various regions should establish a preparatory committee for the seafarer's club, responsible for carrying out the preparatory work.

    关于在各地设立海员俱乐部的决议
    （一九四九年十二月二十六日全国各地海员工会代表会议通过
    一九五○年一月五日中华全国总工会常务委员会扩大会议批准）
    一、全国各地海员工会代表会议认为：设立海员俱乐部对于组织团结流动无定的海员工人进行文化教育、调剂生活、联络感情、解决各种困难，特别对于国际海员工人的联系与团结有着重大的作用。因此，设立海员俱乐部应成为各地海员工会重要的工作内容。
    二、进行步骤，应根据各地海员工会经费和干部的具体条件，采取由小而大，由简单而逐渐充实，由主要地方到次要地方去做。而海员众多，影响较大的地方如上海、天津、青岛、大连、厦门、广州、武汉等地则应首先集中力量去办。
    三、海员俱乐部，须设在船只集中的港湾码头附近。
    四、海员俱乐部的房屋，由各地海员工会请求当地政府指拨。
    五、海员俱乐部的开办费主要依靠海员工会会员自己的筹募，动员海员群众自己去办。但于必要时得请求当地政府予以补助。俱乐部的经常费，应利用俱乐部的地址与设备，酌收费用，以逐渐达到自给自足。
    六、各地海员工会，应成立海员俱乐部筹备委员会，负责进行筹备工作。
