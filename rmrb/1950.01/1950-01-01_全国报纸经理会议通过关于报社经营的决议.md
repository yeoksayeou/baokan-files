Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 31st. The National Newspaper Managers Conference convened by the General Administration of News has passed a resolution, the text of which is as follows:

    In 1949, the management of democratic newspapers nationwide generally achieved results. They all overcame various material difficulties during the war and delivered a large number of newspapers to a broad readership. However, due to the ongoing recovery of production, transportation, and education, as well as rising prices (especially paper prices, which generally account for 70% of the total cost of newspapers), the purchasing power and scope of readers were limited. As a result, the circulation of both public and private newspapers nationwide was not wide enough, and significant losses occurred. Inefficient division of labor among some newspapers and poor management in most newspapers exacerbated these losses. The People's Government has decided to address the difficulties caused by paper supply and high paper prices by having the National Cultural Paper Management Committee coordinate solutions. Newspaper offices must strive to strengthen their connections with readers, improve the division of labor among newspapers, and overcome irrational management practices. After studying the basic management situation of public and private newspapers nationwide, this conference makes the following decisions:

            Enterprise-Based Approach
    1. The management of all public and private newspapers nationwide must adopt and implement an enterprise-based approach. That is, public newspapers must truly operate the newspaper office as a production enterprise and gradually implement an economic accounting system. Private newspapers must also further improve their management methods on the existing basis. Public newspapers with better conditions should strive to be entirely or mostly self-sufficient, while those with poorer conditions should strive for the greatest possible degree of self-sufficiency with regular and fixed subsidies from the government. The budgets of public newspapers should be reviewed monthly or quarterly by the news administrative departments and finance departments of the people's governments to which they belong.

            Develop the Paper Industry
    2. Support the People's Government's policy of developing the domestic paper industry, coordinating the import of foreign paper, and appropriately allocating cultural paper at low prices. All newspapers should give priority to using domestic paper as much as possible and strive to conserve paper consumption.

            Pricing Issues
    3. The actual price of newspapers should generally be slightly higher than the cost of paper and should not be raised too high to hinder the purchasing power of the broad readership. After the implementation of paper allocation, and before the rural economy has fully recovered, the price of rural newspapers should be slightly lower than the price of urban newspapers, based on the principle that it is not lower than the allocated paper price.

            Newspaper Distribution
    4. Newspaper distribution work should learn from the experiences of the Soviet Union and our Northeast and Shandong regions and gradually transfer all distribution to the post office. Each newspaper can sign distribution contracts with local post offices according to specific circumstances. In areas where the post office cannot yet undertake newspaper distribution tasks, each newspaper should vigorously improve its distribution work, striving to expand the distribution coverage of newspapers. Wholesale discounts should generally not be less than 30%. Preferential treatment for readers should focus on preferential treatment for reading groups, collective subscribers, and subscribers who are enthusiastic about promoting subscriptions, and gradually change the current method of simply paying attention to composition. Giving away, exchanging, and storing newspapers should all be done as economically as possible. Newspaper fees should be collected in advance in principle.

            Advertising Issues
    5. Advertising is necessary in current urban newspapers. Urban newspapers should actively publish advertisements beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood in appropriate positions to promote production and cultural undertakings and serve the daily needs of the people, while also increasing the financial income of the newspaper office. However, newspaper offices should review the content of advertisements and appropriately limit the amount of advertising. Private advertising agencies in large cities should be led in appropriate ways.

            Newspaper Office Staffing
    6. The staffing of public newspapers should be based on the principle of enterprise management and appropriate standards should be formulated according to specific circumstances. For redundant personnel and family members who cannot participate in newspaper work, they should be sent to schools or assigned other jobs separately. Staff expenses should be calculated as part of the newspaper's costs, just like operating expenses. Personnel who cannot be placed temporarily should be specially budgeted for and should not be included in the enterprise budget. In units that implement a salary system, whether public or private newspaper offices, wages should be maintained at a general level and should not be too high, so as not to prevent the newspaper office from sustaining itself.

            Accounting Work
    7. Good accounting work is necessary for implementing enterprise management. Public newspapers must first clear assets, stipulate material consumption standards, gradually unify accounting subjects, implement cost accounting, and establish various necessary reporting systems.

            Democratic Management
    8. Attention should be paid to democratization in the management of newspaper offices. Trade unions should be universally organized in the entire newspaper office to facilitate the development of the enthusiasm of newspaper employees.

    The conference believes that implementing the above decisions is in line with the interests of the people's political and cultural life and the state's financial situation. However, in order to realize these decisions, a series of difficulties must be overcome. All personnel of public and private newspaper offices nationwide should work together to overcome difficulties and realize these decisions.

    全国报纸经理会议通过关于报社经营的决议
    【新华社北京三十一日电】新闻总署所召开的全国报纸经理会议通过一项决议，原文如下：
    一九四九年全国民主报社的经营，一般地是有成绩的。它们都克服了战争时期各种物质困难，使大量的报纸达到了广大读者的手中。但是由于生产交通和教育还在恢复过程中，物价（特别是纸价，一般占报纸总成本百分之七十）上涨，读者的购买力和读者范围都受到了限制，以致全国公营与私营报纸的发行都还不够广，而且发生了严重的赔耗现象。而部分报纸分工不甚合理，和多数报纸经营不善，则加重了这种赔耗。人民政府对于报纸因纸张供给和纸价昂贵所造成的困难，已决定由全国文化用纸管理委员会统筹解决。报社方面必须努力加强对读者的联系，改善报纸间的分工，和克服经营中的不合理现象。本会议在研究了全国公私营报纸经营的基本情况以后，特作如下决定：
            企业化方针
    一、全国一切公私营报纸的经营，必须采取与贯彻企业化的方针。即公营报纸必须把报社真正作为生产事业来经营，逐步实行经济核算制。私营报纸亦须在已有基础上进一步改善经营方法。条件较好的公营报纸应争取全部或大部自给，条件较差者亦应在政府定期定额的补贴下，争取最大可能的自给程度。公营报纸的预算，应逐月或逐季由所属人民政府的新闻行政部门和财政部门共同审核。
            发展造纸工业
    二、拥护人民政府发展本国造纸工业，统筹外纸进口及对文化用纸适当低价配售的政策。各报应尽量首先采用国产纸，并对纸张消耗力求节约。
            报价问题
    三、报纸实收价格，一般应以稍高于纸张成本为原则，不应高抬价格，妨碍广大读者的购买。在配纸实行以后，在农村经济还未完全恢复时期，农村报纸的价格，应在不低于配售纸价的原则下，稍低于城市报纸的价格。
            报纸发行
    四、报纸发行工作，应学习苏联及我东北、山东的经验，逐步地全部移交邮政局办理。各报可按具体情况与各地邮局签订发行合同。在邮局尚不能担负报纸发行任务的地区，各报应大力改进发行工作，力求报纸发行面的扩大，批发折扣一般应不低于七折。对于读者的优待，应当着重于优待读报组、集体订阅户和热心推广订阅的订户，而逐步改变现在的单纯注意成份的办法。赠送，交换，存报都应力求节约。报费以预收为原则。
            广告问题
    五、广告在目前的城市报纸上是必要的。城市报纸应当以适当地位主动地刊登有益于国计民生的广告，以推进生产和文化事业，并服务于人民群众的日常需要，同时也由此增加报社的财政收入。但报社应当审核广告内容，并适当地限制广告篇幅。对大城市中的私营广告社应以适当方法加以领导。
            报社编制
    六、公营报纸的编制应本企业化方针，根据具体情况，拟订适当标准。对于冗员和不能参加报纸工作的家属，应分别送入学校或另行分配工作。工作人员费用应与事业费同样作为报纸成本计算。暂时不能安置的人员应作特别预算，不应列在企业预算之中。在实行薪水制的单位中，无论公私营报社，工资应保持一般水平，不应过高，免使报社不能维持。
            会计工作
    七、实行企业化必需作好会计工作。公营报纸必须首先清理资产，规定材料消耗标准，逐步统一会计科目，实行成本计算，并建立各种必要的表报制度。
            管理民主化
    八、报社的管理应注意民主化。以整个报社为单位的工会应当普遍组织以利发扬报社职工的积极性。
    会议认为：执行上述各项决定，是符合于人民政治文化生活和国家财政状况的利益的，但是为了实现这些决定，必须克服一系列的困难。全国各公私营报社的全体人员，应当为克服困难，实现这些决定而共同努力。
