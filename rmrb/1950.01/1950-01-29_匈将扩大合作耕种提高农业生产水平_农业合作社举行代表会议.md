Xinhua News Agency, Budapest: A representative meeting of agricultural production cooperatives and workers from machine and tractor stations in Hungary was held here on the 26th. In his opening speech, Hungarian Minister of Agriculture, Erde, described the achievements of agricultural production cooperatives in the past year and a half, and pointed out that the purpose of this conference is to summarize the experiences accumulated by agricultural production cooperatives and the tasks they face.

Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Keresztes, reported that in the past year, the sown area and the number of members of production cooperatives in Hungary have increased fourfold. At present, cooperatives have 70,000 working farmers, with a sown area of 360,000 Holds (equivalent to 205,200 hectares). There are now 1,520 agricultural production cooperatives in the country, with every three villages having their own cooperative. The state has helped agricultural cooperatives with 94 million Forints (Hungarian currency) last year.

Keresztes emphasized that the current task is to shift Hungary's national agriculture from the capitalist path to large-scale cooperative farming, continuously improve the level of agricultural production, expand the labor competition among cooperative members, and more broadly absorb women and youth to participate in all aspects of the cooperative cause.
