    财经委员会规定提高搭购公债金价
    认购公债侨汇按统一牌价折合
    【新华社北京六日电】政务院财经委员会为照顾黄金持有人以黄金搭购公债起见，特规定凡以黄金搭缴公债款（搭缴数量可占认购公债数额的百分之三十）者，黄金每两按人民币六十二万元计算，嗣后牌价变动时，由中国人民银行总行随时调整公布之。此项黄金成色以百分之九十九为标准，超色与损色者均以该标准计算。此项牌价以搭缴公债者为限，其他仍按当地原定牌价计算。
    【新华社北京六日电】中国人民银行为便利各地侨胞认购胜利公债，曾于去年十二月三十一日公布华侨认购公债服务办法，该办法内指定广州、厦门、福州、上海、汉口、天津六地中国银行为代办处所，现鉴于各地外汇汇率不同，为了照顾侨胞利益，特规定凡国外侨胞认购公债之侨汇，无论汇至上开六地何处，均按照总行公布统一牌价折合，上项牌价随时调整，每日由人民银行总行统一公布，并于每晚八点至九点由中央人民广播电台广播各地周知。
