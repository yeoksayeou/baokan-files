Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 11th: According to TASS, in the Dobruja region of eastern Romania, along the Black Sea coast, construction is underway on a grand canal connecting the Danube River to the Black Sea. When this great waterway is completed, the voyage from the lower reaches of the Danube to the Black Sea will be shortened by five-sixths compared to the original route.

The construction of this canal is one of the many undertakings of the People's Government to improve the welfare of the multi-ethnic Dobruja residents, who were previously poor and backward. The Romanian People's Government has not only eliminated oppression and discrimination against ethnic minorities and liberated the poor from terrible exploitation but is now also ending the local state of poverty. Dobruja may seem to have a lot of land, but the farmers have no arable land. This is because the area is full of impassable swamps and arid grasslands, almost entirely desert. After this canal is built, it will give new life to these sparsely populated deserts and swamps. Thousands of hectares of wasteland will be transformed into fertile land, dotted with lush orchards and meadows.

Several new cities are emerging on both sides of the canal, as their construction is being carried out simultaneously with the canal's construction. The desolate small towns of the past will soon become vibrant industrial and shipping centers.

In the canal construction project, the working people have fully demonstrated enthusiastic competition and high labor productivity. Farmers and fishermen are participating in the national mass labor construction work, creating miracles of selfless labor heroism.

The Soviet Union has provided multifaceted assistance to this canal construction project. This is a great encouragement to the Romanian working class and working peasants in their struggle to build socialism.

    变荒漠地带为沃土
    罗国兴建大运河
    连接多瑙河与黑海交通
    【新华社北京十一日电】据塔斯社讯：在罗马尼亚东部、黑海沿岸的多布鲁查地区，现正进行着开凿从多瑙河通达黑海的大运河的工程。当这条伟大的水道完成的时候，多瑙河下游通达黑海的航程将比原来缩短六分之五。
    这条运河的建筑，是人民政权为改善多民族原先是贫穷落后的多布鲁查居民的福利而进行的许多事业之一。罗马尼亚的人民政权，不仅已消灭了对少数民族的压迫和歧视，把穷人从可怕的剥削中解放了出来，现在还要结束当地的贫穷的状况。多布鲁查似乎虽有很多土地，但农民却没有可耕种的土地。因为该地区尽是无法逾越的沼泽和干涸的草原，几乎全是荒漠地带。这条运河凿成之后，它将给这些人口稀少的沙漠与沼泽以新的生命。成千公顷的荒地将变为沃土，点缀着茂盛的果园和草地。
    这条运河的两岸，现正涌现着好几座新的城市，因为它们的建设是和运河本身的工程同时兴工的。昔日冷落的小镇，即将变成生气勃勃的工业和航运中心。
    在运河建设工程中，劳动人民充分表现了热烈的竞赛与高度的劳动生产率。农民和渔民都正在参加全国群众性的劳动建设工作，创造了忘我的劳动英雄主义的奇迹。
    苏联对于这运河的建筑工程，给予了多方面的帮助。这是罗马尼亚工人阶级与劳动农民在建设社会主义斗争中的伟大的鼓舞力量。
