    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th. TASS Moscow dispatch: Filipov published a lengthy essay in Pravda on the 7th, pointing out the growth of the strike movement in the United States after the war, and indicating that its main cause lies in the gradual decline of the living standards of the working people and the unprecedented strengthening of economic and political oppression.
    The scale of the strike movement was particularly large in 1946. In June 1946, price controls were lifted, and prices rose sharply. The working people then began to struggle for wage increases, and the American reactionary groups, fearing the growth of strikes, began to use emergency measures. After the mid-term elections in 1946, the US Congress proposed more than two hundred anti-labor bills. However, brutal anti-labor laws could not stop the strike movement. In 1947, 2.17 million workers went on strike in the United States. In 1948, the number of striking workers reached 2.28 million. In 1949, the strike movement continued to grow. According to the investigation materials of the US Department of Labor, a total of 3,150 strikes were held across the country in the first ten months of 1949, with approximately three million workers participating in the strikes.
    The American working class is forced to carry out strike struggles under difficult conditions. State power organs use anti-labor laws to openly interfere in strikes in order to make them fail. Monopoly capitalists, in their attacks on the working class, receive full support from reactionary trade union leaders, who spare no effort to reduce the class struggle of the American proletariat to a struggle for the lowest economic concessions from the capitalists, and to prevent the laboring masses from struggling for the most important economic and political demands.
    However, recent strikes are often held without the consent or approval of the American reactionary trade union leaders. Many joint actions by local branches of the CIO and the AFL and independent trade unions to defend peace, oppose anti-labor laws, oppose anti-communist hysteria, and oppose racial discrimination prove the growing influence of progressive trade unions on the working class.
    The International Longshore and Warehouse Union, the United Electrical Workers Union, the International Fur Workers Union, and other progressive trade unions have risen up to oppose the aggressive foreign policy of the American ruling groups, oppose anti-labor laws, and oppose the attacks of monopoly enterprises on the living standards and rights of the working people. They receive the growing support of the American working class. Therefore, it is no coincidence that the strikes led by these trade unions are precisely the most tenacious and have won more significant concessions from the capitalists.
    The growth of strikes shows that, despite the many difficulties, the American working class is increasingly resisting the attacks made by monopoly capital on the economic interests and democratic rights of the working people.

    经济与政治压迫空前加强
    美国战后罢工运动增长
    去年头十个月罢工者达三百万
    真理报发表非利波夫论文
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：非利波夫于七日在真理报上发表长篇论文，指出战后美国国内罢工运动的增长，并指出其主要原因在于劳动人民生活标准的逐步下降以及经济与政治压迫的空前加强。
    罢工运动的规模，在一九四六年特别巨大。一九四六年六月，物价管制被取消，物价发生了剧烈的上涨。劳动人民遂开始进行要求增加工资的斗争，美国反动集团慑于罢工的增长，开始使用紧急措施。一九四六年中期选举以后，美国国会所提出的各种反劳工的法案，数达二百余件，但是，残暴的反劳工法案并不能阻止罢工运动。一九四七年，有二百一十七万工人在美国举行罢工。一九四八年，罢工工人的数目达到二百二十八万人。一九四九年，罢工运动继续增长。美国劳工部的调查材料表示：在一九四九年头十个月中，全国共举行了三千一百五十次罢工，参加罢工的工人约三百万。
    美国的工人阶级被迫在困难的情况下进行罢工斗争。国家政权机关利用反劳工法，公开地干涉罢工，以使其失败。独占资本家在向工人阶级进攻中，获得反动的工会领袖们的充分支持，这些反动的工会领袖们，不遗余力地想把美国无产阶级的阶级斗争降低为向资本家争取最低的经济让步的斗争，并阻止劳动大众为至为重要的经济和政治要求而斗争。
    但是，最近的罢工，时常不经美国反动工会领袖们的同意或批准而举行。产联、劳联的许多地方分会和独立工会的保卫和平、反对反劳工法案、反对反共歇斯底里与种族歧视的许多联合行动，证明进步工会对工人阶级的影响的增长。
    国际码头与仓库工人工会、联合电器工人工会、国际毛皮工人工会及其他进步的工会，都奋起反对美国统治集团的侵略性外交政策，反对反劳工法案，反对独占企业向劳动人民的生活标准与权利进攻，他们得到美国工人阶级的日益增长的支持。因此，这些工会所领导的罢工，恰恰是最坚强不屈的，并且从资方争得了更为重大的让步，这并不是偶然的。
    罢工的增长表明：尽管困难重重，美国工人阶级正对独占资本向劳动人民的经济利益和民主权利所作的进攻，进行日益增大的抵抗。
