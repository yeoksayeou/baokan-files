On January 8th of this year, Foreign Minister Zhou sent a second telegram to Mr. Romulo, President of the United Nations General Assembly, and Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, stating that the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group remaining in the United Nations Security Council are illegal and advocating that they be expelled from the Security Council. On January 19th, Foreign Minister Zhou, on behalf of the People's Republic of China, sent a note to Mr. Romulo, President of the United Nations General Assembly, and Secretary-General Trygve Lie, notifying them that Zhang Wentian had been appointed as the chief representative of the delegation of the People's Republic of China to attend United Nations meetings and participate in United Nations work, including meetings of the Security Council and other work. And requesting a reply: When will the illegal delegation of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group be expelled from the United Nations and its Security Council, and when can the legal representatives of the People's Republic of China attend the meetings of the United Nations and its Security Council and participate in the work? Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn and righteous statement represents the demands of all the Chinese people, and we firmly express our support.

The delegation of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary remnant group has long been unable to represent the Chinese people, and the Chinese people have long ceased to recognize them as representatives. When the United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the 10th of this month, the illegal representative of the reactionary remnant group, who had been abandoned by the Chinese people, acted as chairman of the Security Council, which is an insult to the Chinese people and a damage to the reputation of the United Nations. If the United Nations were able to represent international justice, it should have taken the initiative to revoke this illegal representative and invite the representatives of the People's Republic of China, who truly represent the Chinese people. However, the reality is not like this. The illegal representative of the reactionary remnant group, who has been abandoned by the Chinese people, remains shamelessly within the United Nations structure under the support of American imperialism. From this, it can be seen that the imperialist camp, headed by American imperialism, is always hostile to the Chinese people and manipulates the United Nations.

At the same time, I would like to thank the socialist country, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries. They strongly supported Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement at the United Nations meetings. The Soviet representative even stated that the Soviet delegation would not participate in the work of the Security Council until the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group were expelled, and the Soviet Union would not recognize any resolutions passed by the Security Council with the participation of the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group. This proves that only the Soviet Union is a true friend of the Chinese people.

The just support of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries further exposes the true face of the imperialist bloc, especially the British government, which on the one hand expressed its desire to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and on the other hand abstained from voting in the Security Council, actually helping the illegal representative of the Kuomintang reactionary group.

All the Chinese people and even the people of the world support Foreign Minister Zhou's just statement. We solemnly demand that the United Nations immediately expel the illegal representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary group and immediately invite the delegation of the People's Republic of China, with Zhang Wentian as the chief representative, to attend the United Nations meetings and participate in the work.

Whether the United Nations is the United Nations of the people of the world will also be tested in this matter.

    拥护周外长严正声明
    马叙伦
    本年一月八日周外长第二次致电联合国大会主席罗慕洛、联合国秘书长赖伊，声明中国国民党反动残余集团的代表留在联合国安全理事会是非法的，并主张将其从安全理事会开除出去。一月十九日周外长代表中华人民共和国向联合国大会主席罗慕洛和秘书长赖伊发出照会，通知业已任命张闻天为中华人民共和国出席联合国会议和参加联合国工作、包括安全理事会的会议及其他工作的代表团的首席代表。并要求回答：何时开除中国国民党反动残余集团的非法代表团出联合国及其安全理事会，中华人民共和国的合法的代表何时可以出席联合国及其安全理事会的会议并参加工作。周外长词严义正的声明，是代表了全中国人民的要求，我们坚决的表示拥护。
    蒋介石反动残余集团的代表团早已不能代表中国人民，中国人民早已不承认他们是代表，而当本月十日联合国安全理事会举行会议的时候，为中国人民所共弃的反动残余集团的非法代表却在安理会当起主席，这是对中国人民的一种侮辱，这是对联合国声誉的一种损害。联合国假使是能够代表国际正义的话，它早就应该主动地撤销这种非法的代表，而邀请真正是中国人民的中华人民共和国的代表。可是，事实不是这样，为中国人民所共弃的反动残余集团的非法代表，反而在美帝国主义的扶持之下，无耻地留在联合国机构内。从这上面可以看出以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营，始终是与中国人民为敌，而且操纵着联合国。
    同时我要感谢的是社会主义国家的苏联和各人民民主国家。他们在联合国的会议上有力地支持了周外长的严正的声明。苏联代表甚至表示：苏联代表团将不参加安理会的工作，直至国民党反动残余集团的代表被开除为止，苏联将不承认安理会在国民党反动残余集团的代表参与之下所通过的任何决议。这证明只有苏联才是中国人民真正的朋友。
    苏联和各人民民主国家的正义支持，更暴露了帝国主义集团的真面目，特别是英国政府，一方面表示愿意与中华人民共和国建立邦交，另一方面又在安全理事会上弃权，实际上帮助了国民党反动集团的非法代表。
    全中国人民乃至全世界人民是支持周外长正义的声明的，我们严正要求联合国立即开除国民党反动集团的非法代表，立即邀请以张闻天为首席代表的中华人民共和国的代表团出席联合国的会议并参加工作。
    联合国是不是世界人民的联合国，也要在这件事上被考验一下。
