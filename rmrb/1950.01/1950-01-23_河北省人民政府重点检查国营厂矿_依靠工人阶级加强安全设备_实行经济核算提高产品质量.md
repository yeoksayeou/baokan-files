(Baoding Dispatch) The key inspection of state-owned factories and mines in Hebei Province by the Hebei Provincial People's Government concluded on the 20th of last month. The Hebei Provincial People's Government has also formulated methods for improving work and increasing production based on the inspection results. In accordance with the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council, the Hebei Provincial Government issued instructions on December 3rd of last year regarding the inspection of factory and mine work. It also formed four inspection teams composed of cadres from the Industry Department, the Supervision Department, the Public Security Department, the Trade Union, and the Secretariat, to conduct inspections in four key areas: Xinji, Handan, Baoding, and Zhangcun (Shahe). This inspection affirmed the achievements of various factories and mines in completing certain production tasks, but also revealed many serious problems that urgently need to be solved.

        Several factories and mines have extremely incomplete safety equipment and security work.
    1. Several factories and mines still have extremely incomplete safety equipment and security work. Well No. 5 of the Neiqiu Huyugou Coal Mine is adjacent to an abandoned well filled with methane gas. One day, workers at the mouth of Well No. 5 and the abandoned well were burned twice in succession, almost causing an explosion. The leaders of the mine did not pay attention to this serious situation. The inspection team discovered this problem and immediately ordered Well No. 5 to be temporarily shut down, and production was only resumed after the methane gas was discharged. Ninety percent of the sixth-stage moving blades of the main engine of the Baoding Power Plant have been damaged. Since 1947, there have been 14 incidents of blade dropping. In September of last year, the dropping of blades damaged more than 30 copper water pipes in the condenser, and danger may occur at any time now. The fire-fighting equipment in various factories and mines is very rudimentary, and some have no equipment at all. More than 30 theft incidents have occurred in the Wu'an Shaoming Coal Mine. An explosion occurred in the Baoding Iron Factory in June, and this time, it was discovered that a batch of landmines was still buried behind the factory building.

        Relying on the working class for management; production ideology is still unclear.
    2. The idea of relying on the working class to manage production is still unclear in many factories and mines. The leaders of the Wu'an Yihua Factory subjectively divided workers into two types: "activists" (young workers) and "backward elements" (older workers). As a result, the "activists" were isolated, and the leadership was disconnected from the masses. During this inspection, the label of backwardness was removed, and persuasive explanations were given. The workers' production enthusiasm immediately increased. When the Xinji Leather Factory was making leather shafts, the factory director did not adopt the workers' opinions, and the finished leather shafts could not be sold, resulting in a loss equivalent to 246,500 jin of rice. There are still phenomena of cadres and technicians beating and scolding workers in the Huyugou Coal Mine. The management committees of some factories are not functioning effectively. There is no preparation before meetings, and the factory director and manager just talk about their own ideas at the meeting, while other representatives do not speak. The decisions made often cannot be fulfilled.
    3. Many mine leaders are not good at management, do not understand the production situation, and cannot see the serious problems existing in the factories and mines. Before this inspection, the managers of the Zhangcun and Huyugou mines did not know how much coal was produced per day. The Baoding Cotton Oil Factory has been operating the oil press for two months and has not yet calculated the cost in batches. The Xinji Chemical Factory reduced production by the equivalent of 63,000 jin of rice in nine months, and the factory director could not find the reason in time. All factories have initial cost accounting, but it is not accurate enough. The Yihua Yarn Factory calculated the cost four times, but all failed to sign a contract with the cotton and cloth company due to inaccuracy.
    4. The medical and medical equipment in various factories is very rudimentary, and some small factories have none at all. Workers can only be left to their fate when they are sick. The workers' dormitory in the Zhangcun Mine does not even have paper on the windows, and the workers do not have washbasins and cannot wash their hands before eating; however, the staff live in luxury. The employees' cooperatives in various factories and mines have not been run well and cannot guarantee the lives of the employees. In short, not enough attention is paid to the welfare of the workers.

        Failure to act in accordance with the instructions of the higher authorities has caused serious losses to the factory.
    5. Some factories do not act in accordance with the instructions of the higher authorities, thus causing losses to production. The Xinji Leather Factory produces leather shafts. The Provincial Industrial Company instructed it to ensure quality and hire more skilled workers. However, the factory director used more apprentices in order to save wages. The quality cannot be guaranteed, and sales have become a problem. There are also a few managers who abuse their power for personal gain and even undermine policies. Rong Quanlin, the deputy manager of the Zhangcun Coal Mine, has shares in private coal mines. Every time the price of coal rises, he notifies these private coal mines to store a large amount of coal. The manager of the Huyugou Coal Mine lent 100,000 yuan of public funds to private merchants for use. The public suffered great losses after prices soared before it was returned.
    The Hebei Provincial People's Government has formulated an improvement plan based on the results of this inspection and instructed relevant departments to assist the province's factories and mines in implementing it step by step.

        Four Specific Improvement Measures
    1. Resolutely implement the various measures for safety equipment proposed to the factories and mines during this inspection. The Industrial Company is responsible for designating a special person to specifically check the implementation of each factory, and the Mining Bureau is responsible for checking the implementation of each mine. If an accident occurs due to failure to supervise and inspect, the designated person shall be responsible; if an accident occurs due to non-compliance after supervision, the factory or mine shall bear criminal responsibility. The results of this inspection should be discussed by each factory and mine at the factory management committee, and further check what problems still exist in the unit, especially regarding fire and explosion prevention, and should be checked again and again to oppose complacency. Establish a regular inspection system in various factories and mines, specializing in safety equipment inspections. Stipulate rewards and punishments, reward those who have made contributions, and criticize and punish those who have made mistakes according to the severity of the case. Various factories should also combine the problems found in this inspection with other documents to allow cadres and workers to study and discuss, promote a sense of responsibility, and promote the fine style of being actively responsible and cherishing the property of the people.
    2. In order to clearly establish the idea of relying on workers to manage production among the cadres of various factories and mines, the provincial government plans to convene a meeting of managers and factory directors before and after the old year to summarize work, commend factories and mines that have achieved results in relying on workers to improve production, and expose and criticize the bad style of being unconcerned about workers' lives and disrespecting workers' correct opinions. At the same time, it is necessary to use a certain amount of time to study and solve the long-delayed unreasonable wage phenomenon.
    3. Strengthen the economic accounting system of various factories and mines to achieve step-by-step improvement in quality and reduction in costs. In this year's work, improving quality and reducing costs should be regarded as the central task of the year for various factories and mines and the focus of reorganizing factories. Each unit should formulate specific plans for streamlining, saving, and reducing costs based on the production situation, strengthen quota work, first of all, set quality and quantity, and conduct specification verification seriously.
    4. Change the work style of the leading cadres of various factories and mines and turn inspection work into regular work. Regularly inspect production and solve problems anytime, anywhere; establish a system of requesting instructions and reporting, clarify responsibilities and authority, educate and transform cadres whose work is not thorough, and sanction elements who violate discipline, become detached from the masses, and seek personal gain. Also strengthen the professional learning of factory and mine cadres, improve the technical level of management personnel and technicians, and enable cadres to progress from being familiar with the business to mastering the business.

    河北省人民政府重点检查国营厂矿
    依靠工人阶级加强安全设备
    实行经济核算提高产品质量
    【本报保定专讯】河北省人民政府对于该省国营厂矿的重点检查，已于上月二十日结束。河北省人民政府并已根据检查结果，拟定了改进工作、提高生产的办法。河北省府遵奉政务院财委会的指示，于去年十二月三日发出关于检查厂矿工作的指示，并组成以工业厅为主，包括监察院、公安厅、工会、秘书厅等单位干部的四个检查组，分赴辛集、邯郸、保定、章村（沙河）四个重点区进行检查。这次检查肯定了各厂矿完成了一定生产任务的成绩，同时也发现了许多严重的亟待解决的问题。
            若干厂矿安全设备和保卫工作极不完备
    一、若干厂矿的安全设备和保卫工作还极不完备。内邱胡峪煤矿的五号井邻近一眼废井，里面充满沼气。有一天五号井与废井口处连续两次烧伤工人，几乎发生爆炸事件。对于这种严重情况，该矿领导者并未注意。检查组发现了这个问题，即确定五号井暂时停工，将沼气排出再恢复生产。保定发电厂主力机第六节动叶已损坏十分之九，从一九四七年到现在，已经发生十四次掉叶事故。去年九月，掉叶打坏凝气器的铜水管三十多根，现在随时都可能发生危险。各厂矿的防火设备都很简陋，有的根本就没有设备。武安邵明煤矿先后发生达三十多起偷盗事件。保定铁工厂六月间曾发生爆炸，这次又检查出该厂房后还埋着一批地雷。
            依靠工人阶级管理  生产思想还不明确
    二、许多厂矿依靠工人阶级管理生产的思想还不明确。武安益华工厂的领导者把工人主观的划出“积极分子”（青年工人）和“落后分子”（老年工人）两种，结果“积极分子”孤立，领导与群众脱节，这次检查时摘掉了落后的帽子，进行了说服解释，工人的生产情绪顿形高涨。辛集皮革厂作皮轴时，厂长不采纳工人的意见，作好的皮轴卖不出，损失折米二十四万六千五百余斤。胡峪煤矿的干部和技术人员还有打骂工人的现象。若干工厂管理委员会都不起作用，开会之前没有准备，开会时厂长、经理把自己的一套谈谈，别的代表不说话，决议的东西常不能兑现。
    三、许多矿厂的领导者不善于管理，不了解生产情况，看不见厂矿内存在的严重问题。在这次检查前，章村、胡峪两矿的经理都不知道一天出多少煤。保定棉油厂榨油机开动两月，尚未分批计算成本。辛集化学厂九个月减产损失折米六万三千斤，厂长不能及时发现原因。各厂都已有了初步的成本核算，但不够精确。益华纱厂计算过四次成本，都因不精确而无法与花纱布公司订立合同。
    四、各厂医药和医疗设备都很简陋，有些小工厂根本就没有。工人病了只能听其自然。章村矿的工人宿舍连窗户都没有纸糊，工人没有洗脸盆，吃饭时不能洗手；职员住的却很阔气。各厂矿的职工合作社都未办好，不能保障职工的生活。总之，对工人的福利是不够注意的。
            不按照上级指示办事  工厂受到严重损失
    四、有些工厂不按照上级的指示办事，因而使生产受了损失。辛集皮革厂生产皮轴，省实业公司指示要保证质量，多雇用熟练工人。厂长为了省工资，却多用学徒。质量不能保证，销路成了问题。也有少数管理人员假公济私，甚至破坏政策。章村煤矿副经理荣全林在私人煤矿中有股份，每次煤涨价时，他就通知这些私营煤矿大量存煤。胡峪煤矿经理将公款十万元借给私商使用，物价暴涨后才还，公家受了很大损失。
    河北省人民政府根据这次检查结果，已订出改进计划，责成有关部门协助全省各厂矿有步骤地实行。
            四项具体改进办法
    一、切实实行这次检查中对各厂矿提出的关于安全设备的各项措施。责成实业公司指定专人，具体检查各厂执行情形，由矿局负责检查各矿执行情形。如因未督促检查发生了意外，由指定的专人负责；如因督促后不执行发生意外，该厂矿应负刑事责任。这次检查结果，各厂矿应在工厂管理委员会上讨论，并进一步检查本单位还存在着什么问题，特别是关于防火、防炸应再三再四检查，反对麻痹现象。并在各厂矿建立定期检查制度，专为安全设备进行检查。应规定出奖励和处分办法，有功的受奖，有过的分别轻重批评处分。各厂还应把这次检查发现的问题，结合其他文件，让干部和工人学习讨论，发扬责任心，发扬积极负责爱护人民资财的优良作风。
    二、为了在各厂矿干部中明确树立依靠工人管理生产的思想，省府打算在旧年前后，召集经理和厂长会议，总结工作，表扬依靠工人改进生产有成绩的矿厂，揭发和批评对工人生活不关心，不尊重工人正确意见的恶劣作风。同时还要用一定的时间，研究解决目前拖延已久的工资不合理现象。
    三、加强各厂矿的经济核算制度，达到有步骤的提高质量、降低成本。在今年的工作中，应把提高质量降低成本，当成各厂矿全年的中心任务和整理工厂的重点。每个单位都应按生产情况，具体订出精减节约、降低成本的计划，加强定额工作，首先是定质定量，认真的进行规格检定。
    四、转变各厂矿领导干部作风，把检查工作变为经常工作。定期的检查生产，随时随地解决问题；树立请示报告制度，划清职责和权限，教育和改造工作不深入的干部，制裁违犯纪律脱离群众营私肥己的分子。还应加强厂矿干部的业务学习，提高管理人员和技术人员的技术水平，使干部由熟习业务到精通业务。
