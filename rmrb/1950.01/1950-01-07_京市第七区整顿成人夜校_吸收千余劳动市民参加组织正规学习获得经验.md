Beijing's Seventh District Rectifies Adult Night Schools, Absorbing Over a Thousand Working Citizens to Participate in Organized Formal Learning and Gain Experience

[By Our Newspaper] Beijing, The Seventh District of Beijing has achieved initial experience in rectifying various adult night schools. In addition to organizing workers for learning, the district began organizing scattered working citizens who had not participated in various organizations for learning in early October last year, conducting political and cultural education, mainly targeting shop assistants, peddlers, and women. Initially, seven adult night schools were established, five of which used middle school classrooms for classes, and the teachers were high school students. At that time, there were 338 students in the schools. By the end of November, one had collapsed, and the remaining six had increased to 490 students, but half were teenagers and children aged ten to fifteen, and the number of adults was decreasing. In order to rectify the adult night schools, the District Culture and Education Section first conducted in-depth investigations, with three cadres attending classes every evening, making friends with students, and holding small meetings with teachers. They found that the problems existing in the night schools at that time were: (1) The teachers had high turnover, and people were grabbed on the spot before class, and there was no continuity between lectures. (2) There were no fixed textbooks. Several teachers (high school students) in charge of the night schools were busy compiling literacy textbooks, preparing teaching materials, finding teachers, and ringing the bell every day, so busy that they could not even attend monthly exams. (3) Adults and children were in the same class, and their requirements were different. They often quarreled, with children disliking adults for smoking, and adults disliking children for making noise. (4) In the same class, some female students had middle school level education, while others were illiterate. Those with higher education wanted to learn politics; those with lower education wanted to learn literacy.

Based on the above situation, the District Culture and Education Section studied rectification methods: dividing classes according to educational level, strictly separating children and adults, organizing teachers well, selecting fixed textbooks, and strengthening the connection between the Culture and Education Section and the night schools. At the same time, it was estimated that the favorable conditions at that time were: many ordinary citizens wanted to study; there were more than 200 old students with firm learning will as the backbone; the teachers' morale was relatively stable; each night school had a stove, which was warmer than the poor citizens' homes; and the Culture and Education Section had initial experience in running night schools. Therefore, it was decided to expand enrollment and set up nine night schools, enrolling 1,000 to 1,500 people. Before December 15th, the Culture and Education Section conducted preparatory work: at the Neighborhood Group Leader Conference, everyone was called upon to participate in night school studies; various worker-peasant textbooks and political pamphlets were collected from bookstores, and the issues of class division, teaching materials, and teacher reference books were studied; at the same time, enough teachers were organized from various middle schools, and letters of appointment were prepared. On the evening of December 16th, a joint meeting of teachers was convened, first reporting on the achievements, experiences, and lessons learned from past work, announcing the direction of future development, and discussing various specific issues together. It was preliminarily decided on the spot to divide students into high, middle, and elementary levels using oral tests, and to establish an examination system, issuing certificates and promoting students who reached a certain level of study. Regarding the curriculum, classes were held three times a week, two hours each time. For elementary and middle levels, there were two classes of Chinese, two classes of arithmetic, one class of political knowledge, and one discussion; for advanced classes, there were two classes of Chinese and politics each, one class of arithmetic (or abacus), and one discussion; music and entertainment were inserted between the two classes or before class. Each subject had a dedicated teacher, using fixed textbooks and materials. Each school had a principal and a teaching affairs director to be responsible for contacting the classes, unifying steps, holding a teaching affairs meeting once a week, and reporting the situation to the District Culture and Education Section. The children in the night schools were concentrated to run two half-day schools. From the 19th to the 27th, when enrollment closed, each school had a total of 1,327 students, all of whom had been formally divided into classes and started classes. For a part of the students with high school education or above who registered, the District Office separately opened a study class for intellectuals to study politics.

After this rectification, the teachers in each night school were more responsible than before and felt that the work had a clear direction. Many students felt that studying three days a week was not enough and asked to attend classes six days a week. After explanation and persuasion, study groups were organized to allow them to study collectively on their own on nights without classes. However, some night schools did not start studying immediately after enrollment, or because of problems with teaching methods, so the class situation in each school was still inconsistent. On average, the attendance rate for women was around 80%, and for men around 60%.

The current experiences gained are: (1) Adult night schools should gradually establish formal learning according to the requirements of students. Initially, students did not like to learn culture, but liked to listen to current affairs analysis and stories of the old liberated areas and the People's Liberation Army, but after a long time, they would automatically ask to learn to write letters, calculate accounts, etc.; as long as the teaching is good, citizens are willing to learn. (2) The dedicated teacher system is a relatively successful experience, which can avoid teacher turnover, enhance their sense of responsibility, strengthen teacher-student connections, and avoid a night school being contracted by a few people, which would delay the teachers' own learning or work. (3) Strict class division, children and adults must be separated; those with high and low educational levels must be separated. (4) Establishing an examination system, stipulating certain textbooks and materials, and issuing certificates upon graduation are highly valued by citizens. (5) Strengthen leadership and exchange experiences. Cadres from the Culture and Education Section often go to understand the situation and print and distribute the situation and existing problems of each school to each school at any time. The Seventh District calls this bulletin the "Mobilization Newspaper," which plays a great role in mobilizing the emotions of teachers and students in each school. (6) It is best for cadres from the police station or district office to give a lecture once a week in a planned way, because citizens are very willing to understand policy issues related to themselves.

    京市第七区整顿成人夜校
    吸收千余劳动市民参加组织正规学习获得经验
    【本报讯】北京市第七区整顿各成人夜校，获得初步经验。该区在组织工人学习之外，于去年十月初起，开始组织一般未参加各种组织的零散劳动市民学习，进行政治、文化教育，以店员、摊贩、妇女为主要对象，起初成立成人夜校七处，其中有五处利用中学教室上课，教员是高中学生。当时各校共有学生三三八名。到十一月底，有一处垮了台，其余六处学生增至四九○人，但一半是十岁到十五岁的少年与儿童，成人越来越少。区文教科为整顿各成人夜校，首先深入了解情况，由三个干部每晚到各夜校参加听课，和学生交朋友，和教员开小会，发现当时夜校中存在的问题是：（一）教员流动性大，上课时现抓人，讲课前后不接气。（二）没有一定的课本，几个负责夜校的教员（中学生），每天忙于编印识字课本、准备教材、拉教员、打铃等，忙得连月考都不能参加。（三）成人与小孩一起上课，各人所要求的不同。而且时常吵嘴，小孩嫌成年人抽烟，成人嫌小孩子吵嚷。（四）同班中女学员，有的是中学程度，有的一字不识。文化程度高的愿光学政治；文化程度低的愿意学着认字。
    根据以上情况，区文教科研究了整顿方法：按文化程度分班，把小孩和成人严格分开，把教员组织好，选出一定课本，并加强文教科与各夜校的联系。同时，估计当时有利条件：一般市民要求学习的多；有了二百多学习意志坚决的老学生作骨干；教员的情绪比较安定了；各夜校都有火炉，比贫苦市民家里还暖和；而且文教科有了办夜校的初步经验，于是决定扩大招生，设夜校九处，招收一千人至一千五百人。十二月十五日以前，文教科即进行准备工作：在闾组长会议上，号召大家参加夜校学习；又到各书店搜集各种工农课本及政治小册子，并研究分班，教材及教员参考书等问题；同时到各中学组织足够的教员，并准备聘书。十二月十六日晚，召开了一次教员联席会议，首先报告过去工作的成绩和经验教训，宣布今后发展的方向，并就各项具体问题，共同讨论，当场初步决定：用口试将学生分为高、中、初三级，并订立考试制度，修业达到一定水平，发给证书并升级。课程问题，每星期上课三次，每次两小时，初级和中级是两堂国语，两堂算术，一堂政治常识，一堂讨论；高级班国语、政治各两堂，算术（或珠算）、讨论各一堂；音乐娱乐插在两堂中间或上课前。每门课都确定专任教员，采取固定课本教材，每校有校主任和教务主任负责各班联系，并统一步骤，每周各校开一次教务会，并向区文教科汇报情况。各夜校中的儿童，集中起来办两个半日学校。自十九日至二十七日招生截止，各校共有学生一千三百二十七人，都已正式分班上课。报名中对一部分有高中以上文化程度的学生，则另由区公所单开了一个知识分子学习班学习政治。
    经过此次整顿之后，各夜校教师比以前教学更负责，感到工作有了头绪。学生中有许多人感到每星期学习三天不够，要求上课六天，经过解释说服，组织了学习小组，让他们在没有课的晚上自行集体学习。但有个别夜校报名后没有立即开始学习，或因教学方法有毛病，所以各校上课情况好坏还不一致，平均妇女出席率在百分之八十左右，男子百分之六十左右。
    目前所获得的经验有几点：（一）成人夜校应根据学生的要求，逐步建立正规学习。最初学生不爱学文化，爱听时事分析，老解放区和解放军的故事，但时间久了，就自动要求学写信、算账等；只要教得好，市民是愿意学习的。（二）专任教员制是比较成功的经验，可以避免教员的流动，增强其责任感，加强师生联系，而且可以避免一个夜校由几个人包办，以致误了教员自己的学习或工作。（三）严格分班，小孩和成人必须分开；文化程度高的和低的必须分开。（四）建立考试制度，规定一定课本教材，毕业发给证书，市民很重视这一点。（五）加强领导及交流经验，文教科干部经常去了解情况，并随时将各校情况及存在问题印出来分发各校，七区称这种通报为《鼓动报》，对鼓动各校教员学生情绪起很大作用。（六）派出所或区公所干部最好每周有计划地去讲一次课，因为市民很愿意了解有关本身的政策问题。
