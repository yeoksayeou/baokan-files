The entire women cadre force of Weixian County, Hebei Province, launched a work-study competition last winter while delving into key villages to create experiences in women's work. Many of the women cadres in the county were new, with limited work experience. The county Women's Federation decided last October to divide the 26 women cadres into three work teams, sending them to key villages to carry out work, absorb experience, and promote women's work throughout the county. The Weixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on women Party member cadres to establish a new work style, and the Women's Federation also mobilized women cadres to launch a competition in work and study.

During the 40 days of work, all the women cadres mobilized all the female labor force and a portion of the semi-labor force in the three key villages to participate in agricultural production, reversing the reluctance of some women to work and making them understand that to become prosperous and harmonious families, they must participate in labor. At the same time, they reorganized and improved the women's association organizations in the three key villages, established women's representative conferences, reformed five lazy women, and cultivated 40 democratic families. In terms of learning, during this period, some women cadres learned more than 150 new characters, and one group learned an average of more than 80 new characters per person; those with higher levels of education wrote work diaries and study notes every day. Everyone worked and studied all day long. Although they were allowed three days of leave per month to go home, some women cadres insisted on not returning. On November 20th, all the women cadres summarized and examined the work of this stage and selected three models. Since then, a vigorous new work style has been established among the women cadres. The Women's Federation is preparing to continue carrying out work, study, and style competitions to promote the cadres' revolutionary heroism.

    威县全体妇女干部开展工作学习竞赛
    【本报讯】河北省威县全体妇女干部，在去冬深入重点村创造妇女工作经验中，开展了工作学习竞赛。该县妇女干部多是新干部，工作经验较少，县妇联会于去年十月决定将全体妇女干部廿六人分作三个工作组，深入三个重点村开展工作，以吸取经验，推动全县妇女工作。中共威县县委号召妇女党员干部树立新的工作作风；妇联并发动妇女干部在工作上、学习上展开竞赛。
    在四十天的工作中，全体妇女干部发动了三个重点村全部妇女整劳动力及一部分半劳动力参加了农业生产，扭转了部分妇女不愿劳动的想法，使她们明白了要想发家致富，和睦家庭，必须参加劳动的道理。同时整理和健全了三个重点村的妇会组织，成立了妇女代表会；还改造了五个懒惰妇女，培养了四十个民主家庭。在学习方面，在此期间有的妇女干部学了一百五十多个生字，有一组平均每人学了生字八十多个；文化程度较高的每天写工作日记和学习笔记。大家整天工作学习。规定每月准三天假回家，有的妇女干部坚持不回去。十一月二十日全体妇女干部总结与检查了此一阶段工作，并选出三名模范。此后，妇女干部中已树立起朝气勃勃的新作风。妇联会准备继续开展工作、学习及作风的竞赛，以发扬干部的革命英雄主义。
