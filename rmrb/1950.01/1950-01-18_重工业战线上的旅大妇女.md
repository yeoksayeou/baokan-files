    Women of Lüda on the Heavy Industry Front
    Gǔ Tīng
    Only four years ago, the Lüda area was still trampled under the iron hooves of Japanese imperialism. The tragic fate of the Lüda working people, especially women, was unimaginable. Now, the streetcars passing through the city have female drivers, the trains traveling thousands of miles will also have female drivers, and in workshops, foundries, and around steelmaking furnaces, as fitters, electricians, welders, foundry workers, in chemical plants, in huge shipyards, and in all heavy industry sectors, there are skilled female workers. The banner of women in New China participating in heavy industrial production is flying high over Lüda.

            More than two thousand female workers are skillfully working in various heavy industry sectors

    In just four years, in Lüda, the number of female workers participating in heavy industrial production has reached two thousand three hundred and sixty-eight. This includes nine female train drivers, twenty female streetcar drivers, one hundred and twenty-three female lathe operators, thirty-one female ship repair workers, ten female steel casters, and forty-nine female chemical workers.

    For women, participating in heavy industrial production and learning and mastering modern technology is much more difficult than it is for men. In addition to the limitations of physiological conditions, the feudal consciousness remaining from the old society so severely binds people. People always think that "women cannot do this kind of work," and women themselves mostly have this idea: "Just work for a few days and then get married, don't end up looking like a greasy, dirty boy, it will be hard to find a husband."

    The female train assistant driver Tián Guìyīng and the skilled female lathe operator Qī Guìzhī are a clear example. When they first entered the factory, they were afraid of becoming "dirty boys, making it hard to find a husband," so they only did some odd jobs. After their views changed through education, they were full of confidence in learning modern technology. At this time, her mother said: "A girl of seventeen or eighteen, mixing with boys, it's not good if it's too close, and not good if it's not close enough, we can't go." Her father said: "What's the point of learning that! Just deal with it for a few more days and then get married." After overcoming this difficulty, they didn't expect that the teacher would be unwilling to teach such apprentices. The teacher said: "Female apprentices never learn well, they get married in a few days, it's a waste of effort. It's better to teach a male apprentice and be sure of the result." These difficulties were already numerous enough, but some male workers were still making sarcastic remarks on the side: "Can women do this kind of work? What would men do then!" Some cadres said that women were physically weak and could not support it.

            Heroic female workers, breaking through numerous obstacles, plunged into the wave of learning modern technology.

    Without perseverance, one would be intimidated by these obstacles. However, the women of New China, just like the heroic spirit they showed in the struggle against the enemy, are fearless in the construction of the motherland. They said: "We must do something to show them!" Their belief was supported by Soviet comrades in the factory. Because in the Soviet Union, it is common for women to drive trains, airplanes, and tanks.

    So, starting in June of last year, Tián Guìyīng, Wáng Bǎohóng and six other female workers began to learn to drive trains. At this time, the factory had successively recruited more than forty young female workers.

    Driving a train involves three jobs: fireman, stoker, and driver, and you have to learn them one by one from the beginning. They first learned to be firemen. The first lesson of this job was to shovel coal into the furnace, which was quite difficult. Several tons of coal had to be shoveled in one scoop after another. At first, they were afraid of failing, afraid that the banner that had just been raised would fall, blocking the road for women to participate in heavy industrial production, so they always used as much strength as they could. They worked continuously for three days, so tired that their backs ached and their legs were sore, but they didn't say a word. When the section chief asked, they always smiled and said: "Not tired, it's nothing." Later, when they got on the train, male workers could shovel more than two hundred and eighty scoops of coal in eighty-five minutes, while they could shovel more than two hundred and thirty scoops. Once, on a locomotive pulling fifty-eight carriages, Tián Guìyīng worked all the way from Dalian Station to Èrshí lǐ tái, a distance of forty-seven point eight kilometers. Labor hero Lǐ Qìngróng, amazed by Tián Guìyīng's outstanding achievements, affirmed: "Tián Guìyīng is really capable! Based on this skill alone, I believe she can learn to drive a train." He said: "To be honest, it's not easy for women to do this."

            The leadership closely cares about the health and technical training of female workers.

    The astonishing work spirit of the young female workers caused concern from Section Chief Lǐ, who changed their one-shift-a-day system to a one-shift-every-three-days system. But when it wasn't their turn to work, they secretly got on the train. To take care of their bodies, four hundred catties of rice were distributed, but they often didn't bring lunch boxes when they got on the train. Section Chief Lǐ got anxious and ordered them to check if they were carrying lunch boxes when they got on the train, and also asked them to write "reasons" for violating the order by sneaking onto the train.

    After getting off the train, Section Chief Lǐ found four male drivers who were more patient and technically skilled to teach them knowledge about braking, signals, operating rules, and locomotive structure. Section Chief Lǐ also took time to give them lessons. In this way, three months after Tián Guìyīng, Wáng Bǎohóng and the other six began to learn to drive trains, they had a preliminary understanding of locomotive structure, fire penetration, calculation of vehicle speed, and operating rules. Moreover, Tián Guìyīng and Wáng Bǎohóng had also test-driven locomotives several times. When I recently visited them, the chairman of the section's trade union told me that nine women are now learning to drive trains. Tián Guìyīng, Wáng Bǎohóng and the other six who came first have been promoted to assistant drivers, and Tián Guìyīng and Wáng Bǎohóng will be promoted to full drivers in the short term. This year's "March 8th" Women's Day will see locomotives operated entirely by women appearing on China's liberated land, which will be completely without problems.

    In the locomotive depot, recently, the female assistant drivers of light oil vehicles, Hán Shūyīng, Zhāng Guìzhī, and Yú Xiùzhēn, have completed their apprenticeships. This type of vehicle is easier to operate, but the complexity of the machine structure is no less than that of a locomotive. At the moment, they are not only able to operate it, but also able to disassemble and overhaul it independently. In addition, six female operation commanders (who receive orders from the railway bureau dispatcher to move locomotives) began to be trained in October of last year. They need to understand locomotive structure, locomotive names, and train routes, etc. This is a very meticulous and important job. Because a negligence or a poorly planned plan could delay the urgent transportation of thousands of tons of supplies, and two trains could be damaged on the tracks.

    Let's take the Dalian Ship Repair and Shipbuilding Factory (shipyard) as an example. This factory has more than one hundred and thirty female workers in various positions such as lathe, drawing, casting, steel casting (making anchor chains), electrical, fitter, water gate, and screw. Most of them only entered the factory in April of last year, but twenty-nine female lathe operators are already undertaking very skilled work. And seven have taken on apprentices. The female crane operator of the steel casting factory, Zhōu Fèngyīng, is only eighteen years old this year and can hoist and transport bright red molten steel and anchor chains on a crane three or four zhang high.

    In Dalian, there are twenty female streetcar drivers who drive streetcars through the streets all day long. When a Soviet streetcar company technician named Morozov saw that the streetcar he was riding, which didn't shake at all, was driven by a young female worker, he was pleased with her skillful technique and wrote a letter to the Dalian Transportation Company to praise her. The letter said: "I was very surprised by the skill and ease of her technique. The car starts very smoothly, without shaking at all; in addition, she is very economical with electricity." He requested the transportation company to commend her spirit of service. A few days later, Morozov brought gifts to the Dalian Transportation Company manager and congratulated the young female driver Shí Yuèméi. This is not surprising, all Soviet friends care about the Chinese in this way. Because they have a belief: "Not caring about women's liberation is not caring about the revolution." Please see the mood of a Soviet female technician named Vali when she trained two Chinese girls to learn the technology: In a letter to her mother in the Soviet Union, she said: "The two Chinese girls I trained have now completed their apprenticeships. How happy I am! Mom! Please don't worry about me, I won't be lonely with the Chinese. Comrade Stalin has instructed us: 'We must tell the Chinese all our knowledge and technology. When the Chinese are able to learn and are able to manage their factories and enterprises without difficulty, and do not need us to serve in China, we will return to the Soviet Union.' How happy I will be to meet you then!"

            A large number of female workers have quickly mastered heavy industrial technology, and their ranks are being rapidly improved.

    Some people seem to doubt that women's progress in learning technology must be slow. Let me answer this question with an example. Two female lathe operators from the Dalian Railway Factory under the China Changchun Railway—Qī Guìzhī and Lín Yùhuā—have only been learning to be lathe operators for more than a year, and Qī Guìzhī is only nineteen years old this year, but both of them are already masters who have brought out five apprentices each. They are earning the wages of fifth-grade workers (Lüda workers' wages are divided into seven grades, with the best technology being the seventh grade).

    The Metal Machinery Factory under the Far East Electric Power Company recruited more than two hundred female workers after liberation. The main ones are forty-six lathe operators, seventy-six foundry workers, thirty-four pressure (plating) workers, and three finished product inspectors, and two drawing design workers. The factory officially determined to systematically train female workers in May of last year, and held a technical examination in October (the factory stipulates a technical examination every three months, with promotion and demotion depending on the situation). Among the thirteen female workers who took the exam, seven were promoted from level one to level three, and six were promoted from level one to level two. Because women are meticulous, willing to study, and quickly master technology, and there are fewer accidents in work, women account for fifty-nine of the eight hundred and fifty-five industrial production models in Lüda, and one was elected as a hero.

    The banner of women participating in heavy industrial production has been raised in Lüda. Moreover, a large number of women are pouring into heavy industrial production departments. From Sino-Soviet joint ventures to state-owned and private factories, from urban women to rural women and even female students.

    重工业战线上的旅大妇女
    谷汀
    四年以前，旅大地区还在日本帝国主义的兽蹄下践踏着。旅大劳动人民，特别是妇女的悲惨命运是不堪设想的。而今，穿过街头的电车上有着女司机，日行千里的火车上也将有着女司机，车间、翻砂厂、炼钢炉旁，钳工、电气、熔接、铸造、化学工厂，巨大的船坞内和所有的重工业部门，都有技术熟练的女工在工作。新中国的妇女参加重工业生产的大旗，正飘扬在旅大高空。
            两千多名女工正在各种重工业部门熟练地工作着
    仅仅是四年的光景，在旅大，参加重工业生产的女工已有两千三百六十八人。其中包括九名火车司机，二十名电车司机，一百二十三名车床工，三十一名修船工，十名铸钢工，四十九名化学工。
    参加重工业生产，学习与掌握近代化技术，对于妇女来说，困难要比男子多得多。除了生理条件的限制，旧社会残留的封建意识，又那么厉害的束缚着人们，人们总以为“妇女不能干这一行”，而妇女本身，也多半有这样的想头：“混几天就出阁了，别弄成个浑身油腻的脏小子模样，不好找婆家。”
    女的火车副司机田桂英和熟练的女车床工戚桂芝，是一个显明不过的例子。刚进工厂的时候，她们生怕弄成“脏小子，不好找婆家”，只作些杂务工作。当她们的观点经过教育有了转变之后，她们满怀信心地要学习近代技术。这时，母亲说话了：“十七、八岁的丫头子，和半大小子混在一起，深了不是，浅了不是，咱可不去。”父亲说：“学那干啥！再对付几天就好出阁了。”在冲过这一难关之后，想不到老师又不愿意教这样的徒弟。老师说：“女学徒没个学好，几天就出阁，白费功夫。倒不如教个男徒弟把准儿。”这些困难已经够多了，有些男工人却还在一旁说风凉话：“女人能干这一行？那还用男人干啥！”一部分干部则说妇女体格弱，支持不了。
            英雄的女工们，冲破重重阻碍，投入近代技术的学习浪潮中。
    如果没有坚忍的毅力，会被这些阻碍吓倒的。可是，新中国的妇女如同在和敌人斗争中所表现的英雄气概一样，她们在祖国的建设事业中，也是一无所惧的。她们说：“非干个样给他们看看不行！”她们的信念得到了工厂内苏联同志的支持。因为在苏联，妇女开火车，驾飞机、坦克是一件平常的事情。
    于是，从去年六月起，田桂英、王宝鸿等六个女工，学习开火车。这时，工厂先后已经招收了四十多个青年女工了。
    开火车，有三件工作：火夫、司炉、司机，得一样一样从头往上学。她们先学作火夫。这门活计的第一课是向炉内投炭，这可够苦，那好几吨煤，要一锨接着一锨地投进去。开头，她们怕不及格，怕刚刚竖立起来的这杆大旗倒下去，阻挡了妇女参加重工业生产之路，总是有多大力使多大力，一连干了三天，累得腰痛腿酸，但是一声没哼。段长问起来，她们总是笑嘻嘻地：“不累，没啥。”以后，她们上车了，男工八十五分钟能投二百八十多锨煤，她们能投二百三十多锨。一次，在拖了五十八个车厢的机车上，田桂英从大连站一气干到二十里台，长达四十七点八公里。被田桂英的卓越成绩所惊动了的劳动英雄李庆荣，肯定地说：“田桂英真能干！就凭这一手，我相信她能够学会开火车。”他说：“说实话，妇女能干这一手，真不简单。”
            领导上密切关怀着女工的健康和技术造就。
    年青的女工可惊的工作精神，引起了李段长的顾虑，把她们的一天一班制，改为三天一班制。可是当轮不到她们工作的时候，她们却偷着上了火车。为照顾她们身体，发给了四百斤大米，她们上车时可常不带饭盒子。李段长急眼了，命令她们，上车时检查她们带不带饭盒，还让她们写偷上火车的违抗命令“理由书”。
    在下火车后，李段长找了四个比较耐心、技术优良的男司机教她们制动机、信号、运转规则、机车构造等知识。李段长也抽空给她们上课。就这样，田桂英、王宝鸿等六人开始学习开火车后的三个月，已初步了解了机车构造、火的透度、车行速度的计算法以及运转规则等。而且田桂英、王宝鸿还试验驾驶过好几次机车。最近我去访问她们时，该段工会主席告诉我，现在已有九个妇女学开火车了。田桂英、王宝鸿等六个先来的妇女已经提拔成副司机，田桂英、王宝鸿并于短期内将升为正司机。今年“三八”妇女节，全部由妇女操纵的机车出现在中国解放土地上，这将完全无问题的。
    在机务段，最近，轻油车女副司机韩淑英、张桂枝、于秀珍已经出徒了。这种车辆操纵起来比较容易，但机器构造的复杂程度却不亚于一个火车头。时下，她们不仅能够操纵它，而且能够单独拆卸和大修理，此外，六名女运转司令员（接受铁路局调度员命令调动机车行走）已于去年十月份开始培养。她们需要了解机车构造、机车名称和车行线路等等。这是一个很细密和重要的工作。因为一疏忽或计划不周到，急待运走的几千吨物资就要误时，两列火车就会在轨上撞坏。
    再拿大连修船造船厂（船渠）来说吧。这个厂就有车床、制图、铸造、铸钢（造锚链）、电气、钳工、水门、螺丝等各种女工一百三十余人。她们大都是去年四月才进工厂的，但二十九名女车床工已经担当很熟练的工作了。并有七名带了徒弟。铸钢厂的女吊车手周凤英，今年才十八岁，能在三、四丈高的吊车上，吊运鲜红的钢水和锚链。
    在大连，有着二十名女电车司机，整日驾驶着电车巡行在市街。当一位名叫莫罗卓夫的苏联电车公司技师看到驾驶他所乘的一点不晃人的电车的是一位青年女工时，他为她的技术熟练而感到愉快，他给大连交通公司写信表扬了她。信上说：“她的技术的熟练与运转的自如，使我非常惊讶。车起动得很稳，丝毫不晃人；另外，她非常节约电力。”他请求交通公司把她的服务精神加以表扬。几天后，莫罗卓夫携带着礼物去找交通公司经理并向年青的女司机时月梅祝贺。这没有什么出奇，一切苏联友人都是这样关心着中国人的。因为他们有一个信念：“不关心妇女解放，就是不关心革命”。请看看有一个名叫娃丽的苏联女技师，在培养出两个中国女孩子学会了技术时的心情吧：她给远在苏联的母亲写的信里说：“我培养的两个中国小姑娘，现在出徒了。我是多么高兴啊！妈妈！请你不要挂念我，我和中国人在一起不会寂寞的。斯大林同志曾指示我们：‘要把我们所有的知识和技术告诉中国人。什么时候中国人能够学会，能够没有困难管理他们的工厂和企业，而不需要我们在中国服务的时候，我们就回到苏联来。’那时候我该是多么高兴的和你见面啊！”
            大批女工迅速掌握了重工业技术，等级同时被迅速提高着。
    有些人似乎怀疑到妇女学技术进度一定慢，让我用实例来回答这个问题。中长铁路所属大连铁路工厂的两位女车床手——戚桂芝和林玉花，学习车床工仅仅一年多，而戚桂芝今年才十九岁，可是她两人已经是各带出五个徒弟的师傅了。赚着五级工人的工资（旅大工人工资分为七级，技术最好的是七级）。
    远东电业公司所属的金属机械工厂，解放后招募了二百多名女工。其中主要的有四十六名车床工、七十六名翻砂工、三十四名压力（镀金）工和三名成品检查员，两名制图的设计工人。该厂去年五月正式确定了有计划的培养女工，十月份考了一次技术（该厂规定三个月考一次技术，根据情形升与降级），进行考试的十三名女工中，有七个由一级升到三级，六个由一级升到二级。因妇女心细、肯钻研，技术掌握快，工作中少出事故，故在旅大的八百五十五名工业生产模范中女的就占了五十九名，并有一名当选了英雄。
    妇女参加重工业生产的大旗，在旅大已经竖起来了。而且，大批的妇女正涌向重工业生产部门。由中苏合营工厂到公营和私营工厂，由城市妇女到乡村妇女以至女学生。
