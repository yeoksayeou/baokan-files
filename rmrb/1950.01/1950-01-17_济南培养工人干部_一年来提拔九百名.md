    Jinan Cultivates Worker Cadres: 900 Promoted in the Past Year
    [This newspaper reports] Jinan city is extensively cultivating and promoting worker cadres. According to incomplete statistics, 957 people have been promoted in the past year. Some are working in trade unions (members of the municipal federation of trade unions, directors and members of factory trade unions, etc.), some are serving as section chiefs, section heads, and staff members in administration, and others are technical cadres. The vast majority of the newly promoted worker cadres have shown themselves to be active in production, able to lead by example, and spearhead the promotion of production throughout the factory. For example, all 21 members of the Chengtong Yarn Factory's trade union committee have played a leading role in production. The leadership in various departments generally attaches importance to the education of new cadres. In addition to ensuring that new cadres participate in various studies along with ordinary workers, they also pay special attention to cultivating and training them in practical work. For example, new cadres are rotated to chair various trade union meetings. When discussing work and formulating plans, veteran cadres help guide methods and solve difficulties in their work, improving their working abilities.
    Some of the newly promoted cadres were trained and cultivated in worker schools. In the past six months, Jinan's worker schools have held two sessions. Of the 500 graduates of the first session, 31 were promoted to work in the municipal federation of trade unions, cooperatives, and other organs, or remained at the school as cadres. Of the rest who returned to their factories, 149 were elected as trade union cadres. Factory trade union cadres are democratically elected by the workers. Those promoted to administrative and technical cadres are mostly nominated by the leadership based on their technical skills and overall performance, discussed by the masses, and then decided by the leadership.
    The conditions for promoting cadres generally emphasize: a clean historical background, political reliability, consistently active in production, a good attitude towards labor, able to lead by example, possessing skilled techniques, able to unite the masses, and enjoying prestige among the masses.
    Jinan city has experienced several shortcomings in the promotion of worker cadres: (1) There is still a tendency toward closed-doorism. Insufficient attention is paid to cultivating cadres in various factories who do not leave production. Some veteran cadres and individual leading departments are not bold enough to promote activists in the production movement, believing that they can only complete tasks if they do everything themselves; or they only rely on higher authorities to send cadres. Some veteran cadres even express dissatisfaction when workers or lower-level employees are promoted, comparing salaries and treatment with the new cadres, creating factionalism. (2) Some of the promoted cadres are used inappropriately. Some workers are active in production in the factory and have close relationships with the masses. Their role working in the factory is greater than if they were promoted to an agency. However, they are promoted to an agency, resulting in some new cadres feeling that they cannot develop their work after arriving at the agency and become depressed. (3) Individual units lack in-depth understanding when promoting cadres, often looking only at the surface. Some workers are promoted merely because they are active in cultural and recreational activities, leading to poor results.

    济南培养工人干部  一年来提拔九百名
    【本报讯】济南市大量培养提拔工人干部，据不完全统计，一年来共提拔了九百五十七人，有的担任工会工作（市总工会委员、各厂工会主任、委员等），有的任行政上的科长、股长、科员等，还有一部分任技术干部。新提拔的工人干部，绝大多数在生产中表现积极，能以身作则，带头推动全厂生产，如成通纱厂工会委员二十一人，在生产中都起了带头作用。各部门领导方面一般重视对新干部的教育，除使新干部和一般工人同样参加各种学习外，并特别注意在实际工作中予以培养锻炼。如工会各种会议，叫新干部轮流主持；讨论工作制定计划时，老干部帮助指导办法，解决工作中的困难，提高其工作能力。
    新提拔的干部，一部分是职工学校训练培养出来的。半年来济南市职工学校共办了两期，第一期毕业的五百人，有三十一人被提拔到市总工会、合作社等机关或留校担任干部。其余的回到各厂后，有一百四十九人被选为工会干部。各厂工会干部，则是职工民主选举的。提拔为行政与技术干部的，则多由领导上根据技术和各方面表现，提出名单，由群众讨论，然后再由领导上决定。
    提拔干部的条件，一般注意了：历史清白、政治上可靠，生产一贯积极，劳动态度好，能以身作则；有熟练的技术，能团结群众，在群众中有威信。
    济南市在提拔工人干部中，曾发生几个缺点：（一）还有关门主义的现象。对各工厂中不脱离生产干部的培养重视不够。还有一部分老干部和个别领导部门不够大胆提拔生产运动中的积极分子，认为凡事总要自己作才能完成任务；或仅指望着上级派干部。甚至一部分老干部看到工人或低级职员被提拔就表示不满，和新干部比薪金、比待遇，闹宗派。（二）对一部分被提拔的干部使用不适当。有的工人在工厂中生产积极，和群众关系密切，在工厂中工作的作用比提拔到机关里来作用大；可是偏偏把他们提拔到机关里来，结果使一部分新干部到机关后感到工作无法开展，苦闷起来。（三）有个别单位提拔干部缺乏深入的了解，往往看表面。有的工人仅仅在文化娱乐活动方面积极，就被提拔了，造成不好结果。
