    North China Electric Power Company and Affiliated Units Comprehensively Carry Out Work Inspection
    Relying on the Working Class to Implement Democratic Reform
    Tangshan Branch Relies on Workers to Overcome Flood Disasters
    Beijing Branch Disconnected from the Masses, Accidents Occur Repeatedly
    [Reported by this newspaper] Following the serious damage accident at No. 6 generator of the Shijingshan Power Plant in the suburbs of Beijing, the North China Electric Power Company and its affiliated units, under the leadership and assistance of the Central Finance and Economics Committee and the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, launched a comprehensive work inspection. Leaders of various units and all employees, with a spirit of criticism and self-criticism, rigorously exposed shortcomings in production work and ideological leadership. Some units combined inspection with improvement, correcting shortcomings immediately upon discovery. The broad masses of workers are very satisfied with this inspection, saying: "This should have been done long ago." They have put forward thousands of constructive suggestions, which the leadership will adopt and implement separately.
    According to the inspection by the North China Electric Power Company and its affiliated units, it was found that: (1) All units have varying degrees of bureaucratic style of being divorced from the masses, and lack a clear understanding of relying on the working class. The comrades in Beijing who took over the electricity system did not combine the takeover work with mass work, one-sidedly understood the top-down takeover method, only grasped the original set of old institutions, and relied solely on the original enterprise management personnel to carry out work, without going deep into the lower levels to understand the situation; when problems occurred in the work, they only discussed with a few people, without consulting with the workers, and could not listen to the opinions of the workers well. Some were busy with daily administrative affairs, and rarely considered the Party's policies. The electricity leading organs in Beijing and Chahar inspected and found that: Due to bureaucratic style in work and the blurred mass viewpoint in ideology, although they also understood that it was necessary to rely on the working class, the actual work was far from it. This is mainly manifested in the fact that they did not approach the masses, could not understand the difficulties and demands of the masses, and the constructive opinions put forward by the masses were not adopted and implemented. The electricity leading organ in Tianjin reviewed that its work was not in-depth, and it did not understand or completely understand the situation below, resulting in many unnecessary losses in the work. This style of work, of course, cannot change the residual poison left over from the old enterprise institutions. For example, the business section chief of the Beijing Branch is still full of bureaucratic habits, and must notify his subordinates by telephone to prepare food and accommodation when going out to work. The business section chief even openly instructed his subordinates not to report the situation to the company. (2) No comprehensive democratic reform and establishment of a democratic management system have been carried out. Under the principle of "do not disrupt the original enterprise organization," many units have carried out some partial reforms, such as eliminating special agents and elements with notorious records who are hated by the masses, changing some systems, and individually adjusting some personnel, but in general, it is still far from enough and not thorough enough. Organizational structure, personnel system, business and technical management systems, etc., basically retain the old set. The leadership of the company neither grasped higher technology or reasonable systems, nor learned from the masses, relying on the masses to solve problems, so they did not dare to carry out reforms. The Tangshan Branch had a relatively clear understanding of relying on the workers, so the work in this area was also done better. When a flood occurred last year, all employees highly demonstrated the spirit of diligence, bravery, and self-sacrifice, overcoming the flood and reducing the loss of people's property. The Beijing Branch failed to consult with the masses regularly, often ordering workers to complete tasks, and could not properly solve the problems raised by employees. The leadership was disconnected from the masses, resulting in a chaotic situation of lax labor discipline, failure to ask for instructions and failure to report, and accidents occurred repeatedly. (3) The unity among leaders of various systems, between new and old cadres, and between company cadres and factory cadres in various units is generally not coordinated enough, and they often cannot cooperate closely and work in unison to complete production tasks.
    Four Improvement Measures
    After a comprehensive inspection, the North China Electric Power Company formulated the following improvement measures:
    1. Strictly correct and eliminate the bureaucratic style of work and its ideological remnants, requiring leading cadres at all levels to break out of the circle of事務ism (a focus on administrative minutiae, neglect of strategic goals and mass concerns), go deep into workshops, machine rooms and workplaces, and regularly participate in various workers' work meetings (such as touch-base meetings, class affairs meetings, and section affairs meetings), to understand the situation on the spot, and help solve problems specifically, and to inspect and supervise at any time. For the past unreasonable systems, a comprehensive study should be conducted, and reforms should be carried out in a focused and prepared manner. All units should use worker representative meetings, group meetings, or various administrative meetings to widely solicit the opinions of the workers and masses. After analysis and research, those that can be done should be done immediately, and those that have difficulties should be overcome as much as possible. As for those that cannot be done at all or do not need to be done, explanations should be given. It is necessary to regularly and correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism, overcome the phenomenon of bureaucracy in work, and improve the sense of responsibility, labor enthusiasm, discipline and awareness of employees. To ensure this, various systems should be established, such as: inspection system, dedicated responsibility system, request for instructions and reporting system, meeting system and various work systems.
    2. Implement democratic reform, streamline institutions, starting with the head office; adjust unnecessary personnel, rationally allocate labor, organize short-term training courses to systematically train and transform cadres, and then gradually move towards quota management, improve efficiency, practice thrift, overcome waste, and reduce costs. It is necessary to simplify various procedures, clearly stipulate unified labor discipline and reward and punishment systems. In business management, a strict economic accounting system and budget and final accounts system should be established to further implement the policy of centralized management and unified dispatch. Oppose the phenomenon of anarchy and undiscipline, strengthen factory security work, and prevent sabotage by special agents and bandits.
    3. Establish a core of centralized leadership, strengthen the leading role of the Party, and on this basis, closely link the Party, government, and trade union, and earnestly establish a regular meeting system to exchange opinions at any time. All major issues should be implemented according to the decisions of the meeting, and a meeting life with criticism and self-criticism should be established. At present, the work of transforming employees should be vigorously carried out, and special attention should be paid to the work of middle and lower-level employees. In factory management, the organization of the factory management committee should be improved. Comrades who are engaged in administrative work should not only ensure the completion of the production tasks given by the higher authorities, but also actively assist the trade union in doing a good job in mass work. Therefore, administrative personnel should be absorbed as much as possible to participate in trade union meetings in order to listen to the opinions and demands of the workers and masses. The trade union should provide opinions to the administration at any time, educate the masses to improve their political consciousness, abide by labor discipline, and mobilize all employees to do a good job in production.
    4. Conduct a general machine inspection, and conduct a safety inspection of the existing power generation, transformation and transmission equipment in groups.

### 华北电业公司及所属各单位全面开展工作大检查  依靠工人阶级实行民主改革

    华北电业公司及所属各单位全面开展工作大检查
    依靠工人阶级实行民主改革
    唐山分公司依靠工人战胜洪水灾害
    北京分公司脱离群众事故不断发生
    【本报讯】京郊石景山发电厂六号机严重破坏事故发生后，华北电业公司所属各单位即在中央财委会、中央燃料工业部的领导帮助下，展开全面工作大检查。各单位的领导者和全体职工一起，以批评与自我批评的精神，严格地揭露生产工作和思想领导上的缺点。有些单位以检查和改进工作相结合，发现缺点立即改正。广大工人对这种检查非常满意，他们说：“早该这样作。”他们提出了千百条建设性的建议，领导方面将分别采纳实行。
    根据华北电业公司及所属各单位的检查，发现：（一）各单位都存在着程度不同的脱离群众的官僚主义作风，缺乏明确地依靠工人阶级的思想。北京方面接收电业系统的同志没有把接收工作和群众工作结合起来，片面的了解自上而下的接管方法，仅仅抓住原有一套旧机构，单纯依靠原来的企业管理人员进行工作，自己不去深入下层了解情况；工作发生问题时只和少数人商量，不去和工人商量，不能很好的倾听工人意见。有的忙于日常行政事务工作，很少考虑到党的政策。北京和察中的电业领导机关检查出：由于作风上的官僚主义和思想上群众观点的模糊，虽然也了解必须依靠工人阶级，但实际作起来却相差很远。这主要表现在没有去接近群众，不能体谅到群众的困难和要求，群众提出了建设性的意见，没有采纳和实行。天津的电业领导机关检讨出自己工作不深入，不了解或不完全了解下面的情况，招致工作中许多不应有的损失。这种作风当然不能改变旧企业机构遗留下来的余毒，例如北京分公司的业务课长仍然官僚习气十足，外出工作时必以电话通知下级准备食宿。营业股长更公开向下级布置，不许他们向公司反映情况。（二）没有全面的进行民主改革及建立民主管理的制度。在“不要打乱原来的企业机构”的原则下，许多单位已经进行了某些局部改革，如清除特务分子及劣迹昭著为群众所痛恨的分子，改变了一些制度，个别的调整了一些人事，但总的说来，还十分不够和不彻底。组织机构、人事制度、业务和技术管理制度等，基本上还保留着过去的一套。公司的领导方面既没有掌握更高的技术或合理的制度，又没有向群众学习，依靠群众来解决，因此就不敢进行改革。唐山分公司依靠工人的思想比较明确，因而在这方面的工作也作得比较好，去年发生水灾时，全体职工高度地发挥了勤劳勇敢与自我牺牲的精神，战胜洪水，减少了人民财产的损失。北京分公司未能经常和群众商量问题，常常命令式地要工人完成任务，对职工提出的问题，又不能恰如其分的适当解决，领导与群众脱节，结果造成劳动纪律废弛，不请示不报告等无组织无制度的紊乱情况，事故不断发生。三、各单位中各系统的领导者间、新老干部之间、公司干部与工厂干部之间的团结，一般说来还不够十分协调，常常不能密切配合、步骤一致地为完成生产任务而努力。
    四项改进工作办法
    经过全面检查后，华北电业公司又拟定以下改进工作办法：
    一、严格纠正和肃清官僚主义的作风及其思想残余，要求各级领导干部打开事务主义的圈子，深入到车间、机器房和工作场所去，经常参加工人各种工作会议（如碰头会、班务会和股务会议等），实地了解情况，具体帮助解决问题，随时检查、随时督促。对于过去不合理的制度，应进行全面的研究，有重点的有准备的加以改革，各单位应利用工人代表会议，小组会议或行政各种会议，广泛征求工人群众的意见，经过分析研究之后，能办的立刻就办，有困难的，应尽量设法去克服，至于根本不能办的或不必要办的应加以解释说明。要经常的正确的展开批评与自我批评，克服工作中官僚主义的现象，提高职工的责任感，劳动积极性，纪律性与自觉性，为了保障这一点应建立各种制度，如：检查制度，专责制度，请示报告制度，会议制度和各种工作制度。
    二、实行民主改革，精简机构，首先从总公司开始；调整不必要的人员，合理配备劳动力，组织短期训练班有计划的培养和改造干部，而后逐渐走向定额的管理，提高效率，厉行节约，克服浪费现象，以减低成本。必须简化各种办事手续，明确规定统一的劳动纪律与奖惩制度，在业务管理上应建立严格的经济核算制度和预决算制度，进一步贯彻集中管理统一调度的方针。反对无政府无纪律的现象，加强工厂保卫工作，防止特务匪徒的破坏。
    三、建立集中领导的核心，加强党的领导作用，在这种基础上密切党政工的联系，认真建立定期的会议制度，随时交换意见，一切大的问题，都应根据会议决定去执行，并建立起有批评与自我批评的会议生活，目前应大力进行改造职员的工作，特别要注意做好中下级的职员的工作，在工厂管理上应健全工厂管理委员会的组织，担任行政工作的同志，不但要保证完成上级所给予的生产任务，而且应主动地协助工会搞好群众工作，因此工会开会时应尽量吸收行政人员参加，以便听取工人群众的意见和要求，在工会方面应随时向行政供献意见，教育群众提高政治觉悟，遵守劳动纪律并发动全体职工搞好生产。
    四、普遍进行机器大检查，将现有的发变送电各系统的设备，分组进行一次安全大检查。
