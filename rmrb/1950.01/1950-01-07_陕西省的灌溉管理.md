Irrigation Management in Shaanxi Province
Liu Zhongrui

In Shaanxi Province, irrigation projects are designed and constructed by engineers based on hydrological, meteorological, and other conditions. Once completed, the engineers leave. In the past, hydraulic engineers were not like agriculturalists, who continuously study agricultural production generation after generation. If completed irrigation projects are not implemented according to the engineer's original plan, it is often difficult to achieve the expected results. In irrigation management, the efficiency of old management methods differs greatly from that of scientific management methods. For example, the Bao Hui Canal in Shaanxi originally irrigated only 60,000 mu of land, but after scientific management, it irrigated an additional 80,000 mu. Many scientific management methods are the result of collective creation. In Shaanxi's case, it is the joint creation of Mr. Li Yizhi and the peasant masses.

Shaanxi has completed ten major canals to date. Due to experience and lessons learned, it is well understood that irrigation projects must be well managed. The irrigation management methods are briefly described below:

1.  Water Management: Generally, water is allowed to be used when the sand content is below 15%. In spring, the amount of water is small, but the demand is large, creating a management problem. For example, the first watering of cotton is before sowing (early April), and the second watering is from July 1st to July 10th. At this time, the amount of water is small. If it rains in time, management is easy. If it does not rain in time, management becomes much more difficult. Generally, rainfall occurs before the 15th of the month. The third watering is best 17 to 19 days apart from the second watering, and the fourth watering is no later than August 15th. Each watering is 10 centimeters deep. Wheat is sown before November 5th, and often there is no need for irrigation due to rain. The first watering is from December 10th to January 10th, which is winter irrigation, with a depth of 10 centimeters. The second and third watering are from April 1st to May 10th, when the wheat is sprouting and flowering, with a depth of 10 centimeters each time. In southern Shaanxi, rice paddies use the largest amount of water during transplanting from May 25th to June 15th at the latest, with a depth of 25 centimeters. The first irrigation is when the rice seedlings turn green, applying 10 centimeters of water, and then allowing a slight drought for 10 days to encourage branching. After the second irrigation, water is supplied regularly every 7 days, with an amount of 4 centimeters each time, until August 15th. Therefore, rice paddy water usage is concentrated within only 75 days each year.

2.  Organizing the Masses: Each village selects one water conservancy worker, and each bucket area selects one bucket leader. The bucket leader is responsible for the water usage and distribution within the entire bucket area, as well as the statistics and adjustment of land area and the repair and excavation of agricultural canals. Three or four buckets are combined into an area organization, with the bucket leaders electing a water elder to be responsible for the allocation of water in this section of the main canal. Land measurement is very important. Land should be measured after the main canal is completed, otherwise it will be difficult to manage. As for the order of water usage, it is from bottom to top and from left to right. If it is not from bottom to top, it is difficult for the lower levels to get water. After liberation, water conservancy cadres and water elders have created many methods to save water. This year, the Jinghui Canal alone irrigated more than 700,000 mu of land, an increase of more than 20%, from 16 cubic meters per second to 24 cubic meters per second. Regarding the water usage burden, in the past it was not paid to the Water Conservancy Bureau, but now it is paid to the Water Conservancy Bureau. After the farmers finish using the water each year, with the end of October each year as the end date of the year, the farmland in the entire area is divided into three grades according to the actual irrigation situation and harvest amount of cotton fields and wheat fields to pay fees. Those who fully benefit from irrigation are classified as first grade, those who benefit partially in summer are classified as second grade, and those who can only irrigate wheat fields in winter are classified as third grade. Each grade pays 8% of the actual increase in benefits in kind as water fees, which are collected and disbursed uniformly by the Water Conservancy Bureau. After the water fees are collected, 50% can be used to renovate and add to the project, 36% is allocated to the salaries of all canal employees, and the remaining 14% is for printing, miscellaneous expenses, and expansion of water conservancy equipment. Such distribution ensures that each canal becomes more and more perfect year by year. Under this economic principle, many projects of the Jinghui Canal have been repaired.

In Shaanxi, the price of cement is high, with one jin of cement costing five jin of wheat. Therefore, it is used sparingly in normal times and only when it is important and necessary for the project.

After a canal project is completed, it becomes an enterprise, a systematic organization. The most important thing is to mobilize the masses to treat the canal as their own and protect and manage it, otherwise good results will not be obtained. Now the masses in each canal in Shaanxi are very concerned.

    陕西省的灌溉管理
    刘钟瑞
    陕西省的灌溉工程，由工程师根据水文、气象等条件设计建筑完成后，工程师就离开他去。过去水利工程师不和农业家一样，农业家对农产是一代一代连续研究下去的；既完成的灌溉工程，要是不依工程师原来计划实施，常是难达所预期的效果的。灌溉管理中，旧日的管理方法与科学的管理方法效率差的很多，例如陕西褒惠渠原来浇地仅及六万亩，经过科学管理后，又增浇地面积八万亩。许多科学管理，原就是集体创作，在陕西来说，即是李仪祉先生与农民群众的共同创作。
    陕西迄今已完成十大渠，由于经验教训，深知灌溉工程必善予管理，现将灌溉管理办法简述一下。
    一、管水：一般水在含沙量百分之十五以下时方准引用。春季水量小，而需用量大，致成管理上一问题。如棉花第一次浇水在播种前（四月上旬），第二次浇水是在七月一日至七月十日，是时水量少，如及时下雨，管理是容易的，如及时不雨，管理上就大增困难。历年一般在十五日前是要降雨的。第三次与第二次用水，以相隔十七日至十九日为最好，第四次浇水最迟在八月十五日。每次用水均为十公分。小麦播种在十一月五日以前，多以天雨而不须灌溉，第一次用水在十二月十日至一月十日，为冬季灌水，深度十公分，第二次第三次在小麦起芽至扬花，为四月一日至五月十日，水深各为十公分。陕南稻田由五月二十五日至迟至六月十五日在插秧时用水量最大，用水深度二十五公分，第一次灌溉在稻作反青，施水十公分，然后稍旱十日使其分枝；第二次以后，以每七日一次，每次四公分之分量，常期供给，至八月十五日停止，故稻田用水每年集中只有七十五日。
    二、组织群众：——每村选水利干事一人，每斗区域内选斗长一人，斗长司全斗用水及分水，地亩的统计及调整修挖农渠。三、四个斗联合成一个面的组织，由斗长公举水老一人，作为本段干渠负责划分用水的组织。清丈地亩，是非常重要的，在干渠完成后，就要清丈地亩，不然是管理不好的。至于用水秩序是由下而上，由左而右，不由下而上，下面是很难得到水用的。解放后，水利干部及水老们又创造很多办法，节省了用水，仅泾惠渠今年浇地即达七十多万亩，增加百分之二十以上，由十六立方米秒增至二十四立方米秒。关于用水负担，过去不是缴到水利局，现在是缴到水利局，农民每年用水完毕，以每年之十月底为本年度之结束日期，按棉田、麦田，实际灌溉之情况及收获量将全区农田分为三等纳费。完全获得灌溉利益者为一等，夏季获得部分利益者为二等，仅于冬季能浇麦田者为三等，各等就增产受益部分内，以百分之八的实物，缴纳水费，由水利局统收统支。水费征收后，用以整理及添建工程，可支用水费百分之五十；全渠职工开支，统占百分之三十六；其余百分之十四，为印刷，杂勤，及扩展水利设备等。其如此分配，能使各渠逐年愈趋完善。泾惠渠在此项经济原则之下，有许多工程已得到重修。
    在陕西洋灰价格高，一斤洋灰需五斤小麦，故在平常少用，仅在工程重要且必须时才用。
    一个水渠工程完成后，就成了一个企业，一个有系统的组织。其中非常重要的事，在于发动群众把水渠当做自己的，加以爱护与管理，不然是不会得到很好的成果。现在陕西各渠群众甚为关心。
