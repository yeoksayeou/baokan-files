Winter Production Dynamics
Ministry of Agriculture, Central People's Government

Since the autumn harvest, various regions have successively entered the winter production campaign. North China is "doing a good job in winter production to prepare for agricultural production next year" and is "fully organizing the broad masses to develop sideline production." The new districts of East China and Central China are "carrying out winter production in conjunction with suppressing bandits and eliminating local bullies, reducing rent and interest." Especially in the disaster areas, under the guideline of "production for disaster relief, launching a mass self-salvation movement through production," provincial, county, and district levels have successively convened meetings of representatives from all walks of life, people's representative meetings, and party representative meetings. Based on the specific conditions of the local area, they have discussed detailed plans and arrangements for winter production work. Some have established leading organizations for winter production, especially in disaster areas, such as the Production Relief Committee of Hunan Province in Central China. Some regions, such as Shanxi, Chahar, and Western Liaoning, have successively dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside to supervise, inspect, and solve problems. Under slogans such as "turning winter idleness into winter busyness," "production and thrift to prepare for the spring famine," "take action early in winter leisure, don't wait until spring to rush," "one year's crops, two years' work," and "don't eat autumn harvest grain in winter, prepare for next year's spring famine," combined with the lead of rural party member cadres, the meticulous planning of leaders at all levels, timely inspection, and the support of state-owned trading institutions and supply and marketing cooperatives, various difficulties have been overcome, resulting in great achievements in the current winter production movement.

    I. Preparation for Agricultural Production

In order to ensure the victorious completion of this year's grain and cotton production increase tasks, various regions have actively adopted various effective measures. North China's Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and East China's Northern Jiangsu, Shandong, and other places have achieved great results. The first is reflected in fertilizer accumulation. According to statistics from 831 villages in 20 counties in Shanxi Province before the New Year, 9.2 million dan of fertilizer have been accumulated, and 8 counties have reached one-half of the amount of fertilizer applied in spring. It is estimated that fertilizer can be increased by 10% to 20% in 1950. At the same time, attention has been paid to the quality of fertilizer. For example, in most villages in the Changzhi area, corn stalks are chopped up, irrigated with manure, and then covered with a layer of soil to allow the manure to ferment thoroughly. In terms of fertilizer sources, urban manure going to the countryside has become an important part of fertilizer storage. Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Xuanhua in Chahar Province organized a large amount of garbage and manure to go to the countryside. For example, according to statistics from 45 households in Shajiazhuang, Wanquan County, more than 260 carts of manure were taken from Wanquan in less than a month. Beijing plans to lend 20 million jin of dried manure from the city to farmers in the suburbs. In the Jiangsu area, river mud is actively dug to prepare a large amount of fertilizer. The dredging of the Yi River in Northern Jiangsu, the dredging of the Shu and Yi Rivers in Shandong, the repair of embankments in Northern Anhui, the dike breaches of Poyang Lake in Jiangxi, and the dike breaches of Dongting Lake in Hubei, and the dike breaches of the Jianghan area in Hubei have all started and are being repaired. Hebei plans to drill 50,000 wells and promote 70,000 waterwheels this year, expanding paddy fields by 1.5 million mu. Currently, 1,716 brick kilns are rushing to burn well bricks, and 344 waterwheel factories are rushing to manufacture waterwheels. 37,686 waterwheels can be shipped this spring. Cheng'an County had already drilled 530 wells by the end of November. The winter irrigation movement of one million mu in the Fen River basin of Shanxi has now begun. In terms of repairing and supplementing agricultural implements, the Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative used 9 million jin of rice to operate and support the famous Yincheng and Yangquan ironware agricultural implement industries in North China. As a result, the ironware agricultural implement industries in these two places have been greatly developed. Taking the statistics of the fifth district of Huguan near Yincheng as an example, the number of large and small furnaces has increased from 5 to 34, an increase of nearly seven times. Chahar Province produced 140,000 agricultural implements through contracts, and the Pingyuan Province has formulated a plan to increase agricultural implements by one million pieces, which is also actively underway. Other increases in livestock, terracing in mountainous areas, firewood gathering, coal transportation near mining areas, etc., have been carried out in many areas. Under the long-term planning policy, Shanxi Province trained more than 1,200 agricultural cadres to strengthen the technical leadership of agricultural production, and carried out autumn afforestation, planting 26,679 mu of barren hills, focusing on planting 338,799 trees, and collecting 54,194 jin of tree seeds.

    II. Winter Sideline Production

This year's winter sideline production has seen great development and new characteristics under the new situation of urban-rural mutual assistance and internal and external exchanges, that is, gradually transitioning from a wartime self-sufficient economic system to a more organized and planned economic system based on the needs of domestic and foreign markets. Especially in terms of exchange relations, the contract system, in which state-owned economy organizes small-scale farmers' production by signing contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives, has begun to be carried out in Northeast China, North China, and other places, powerfully promoting this transition and reorganization work. For example, in Heilongjiang Province in Northeast China, the General Cooperative has signed a contract with the Heilongjiang Alkali Factory to promote the sales of local alkali, and through the contract, it plans to sell 5.81 million jin of meat, 320,000 jin of medicinal materials, and a large number of sideline products such as fur and fish. The hides and saltpeter of Northeast China, Shandong, Hebei, and Pingyuan, the straw braid and homespun cloth of Hebei and Shandong, the walnuts, hemp skin, oil seeds, medicinal materials, ironware, and sulfur of Shanxi, the animal skins of Northeast China, the grain, wool, and sesame oil of Chahar and Suiyuan, the bristles of various places, etc., have all been largely absorbed into the contract system and have gained extensive sales channels. In this way, the vast number of small producers are organized under the leadership of the state-owned economy. For example, in the Changzhi area of Shanxi, the contract system absorbed 80% of the total trade volume of the area in a short period. This means an important reorganization of the rural sideline economy, from a decentralized self-sufficient economy to a national planned economy. The state can adopt a system of graded responsibility and sign different contracts according to international trade, the needs of urban industry, and the needs of rural areas, to plan and lead small-scale farmers to carry out production, greatly overcoming blindness. Therefore, it also guarantees the sales channels of rural sideline products, so that the sideline production needed by the state can be restored and developed. For example, the saltpeter industry in Qingxian and other eight counties in Hebei Province, according to statistics from 851 groups and 2,135 households, has developed to a monthly output of 1,198,604 jin. The Yangquan mining area in Shanxi Province has restored 513 sulfur mines, thereby restoring the purchasing power of farmers, making the recovery of agricultural production and the industrial goods market possible. For example, in the Muling area of Songjiang, Northeast China, logging, timber harvesting, ginseng harvesting, fishing, firewood gathering, and weaving straw bags earned 14.2 billion yuan from July to September; at the same time, it guaranteed the exchange of foreign trade goods for machinery and urban industrial raw materials; conversely, according to the needs of farmers, contracts were planned and signed to provide farmers with industrial products at low prices, reducing the scissors difference between agricultural and industrial product prices. For example, in Helin County, Suiyuan, Heila kiln used to need 6.7 dou of sesame to exchange for one bolt of homespun cloth from private merchants, but now only 2.7 dou of sesame can be exchanged, improving the lives of farmers. In the new districts, combined with mass movements, the acquisition by the state economy promoted some sideline production. For example, the Mianyang Trade Branch and Native Produce Company in Hubei purchased 190,000 jin of fish, 32,600 bolts of homespun cloth, 3,000 jin of hemp rope, and 7,000 jin of ramie, etc.

    III. Production for Disaster Relief

Disaster areas such as Hebei, Northern Jiangsu, and Shandong are actively taking action under the slogan of "no one starves to death, no land is left uncultivated." Therefore, on the one hand, various sideline productions are carried out, and on the other hand, wild vegetables and substitute foods are collected to tide over the famine. For example, disaster victims in Suqian planted more than 500,000 mu of vegetables in their courtyards, and coastal lake areas net fish. Disaster victims in the Taipei County of Northern Jiangsu earned more than 300 dan of grain in half a month, which can not only be used for their own consumption but also take care of households in difficulty; the Fuyang area organized 754 shoe-making groups, earning more than 4.4 million jin of rice, such as the Nishan area of Shandong, collecting more than 14.4 million jin of vegetables. The Communist Party branch of Qinwangzhuang, Beizhuang District, Lushan County, led the masses of the whole village to carefully calculate accounts and make disaster preparedness plans through various meetings, and used methods such as drying vegetables, collecting bran, cutting mountain grass, transporting grain, selling oil, spinning, and weaving pockets to ensure that there are no idle people in the village. In this way, the whole village earns an average of 365 jin of grain every day, and can earn 32,040 jin by the spring plowing. Pingyin County organized 4,000 people in mountainous areas to quarry stones, and has now quarried 12,878 square meters, and has sold 4,040 square meters, earning a total of 65,030 jin of millet. In addition, 12 villages have cut 699,500 jin of mountain firewood. Dongping County, which is near the lake, has organized 300 sampans to fish, and organized women to net. In areas where production work is well developed, the phenomenon of disaster victims fleeing famine has stopped.

According to the above incomplete materials, the current winter production movement has achieved great results in the preparation for agricultural production, the development of sideline production, and production for disaster relief. However, its development is quite unbalanced. Generally, the old areas and disaster areas have carried out winter production work relatively well, and have been carried out under the combination of administration and economy, with leadership, planning, and steps. In the new districts and non-disaster areas, most of them are more about deployment and calls, and less about specific organization and inspection, thus forming a spontaneous phenomenon. In some areas of the old areas and disaster areas, there is also a phenomenon that the leadership does not pay enough attention, is busy with other work, and relaxes leadership, such as Tongxian County in Hebei and Liangshan County in Pingyuan; in some areas, the policy is not clear enough, such as Northeast China only mentions sideline production, and does not mention the preparation for agricultural production, and some areas only pay attention to the preparation for agricultural production, while neglecting sideline production; in some areas, there is still serious blindness, lack of investigation and research, subjective formulation of plans, and forced implementation by the masses without considering the national market and the needs of the masses. The above-mentioned biases seriously hinder the comprehensive development of winter production.

    冬季生产动态
    中央人民政府农业部
    自秋收以后，各地区大都先后转入了冬季生产运动，华北在“作好冬季生产东北，为明年农业生产作准备”，在“全力组织广大群众发展副业生产”，华东，华中新区则在“结合剿匪反霸减租减息，进行冬季生产”，特别在各地灾区，提出了“生产救灾，开展群众性的生产自救运动”方针之下，省、县、区先后召开了各界代表会议，人民代表会，以及党代表会议，根据当地的具体情况，详细讨论了具体计划与布置了冬季生产工作，有的成立了冬季生产的领导组织，特别是在灾区，如华中区湖南省的生产救灾委员会等，有的地区如山西，察省，辽西则先后抽调大批干部，下乡督促检查解决问题。各地群众在“变冬闲为冬忙”，“生产节约备春荒”，“利用冬闲早下手，别等明春忙加忙”，“一年庄稼两年作务”，“冬季不吃秋收粮，准备明年过春荒”等等口号下，结合农村党员干部的带头，各级领导的精打细算，随时检查和国营贸易机构与供销社的扶植，克服了种种困难，使得目前的冬季生产运动，获得很大的成绩。
            一、农业生产的准备
    为了保证今年粮棉增产任务的胜利完成，各地积极的采取了各种有效措施，华北区的山西、河北、察哈尔及华东区的苏北、山东等地，取得了很大的成绩，首先表现在积肥方面，山西省在年前二十个县八百三十一个村的统计，已积肥九百二十万担，并有八个县达到春季施肥量的二分之一，估计一九五○年能增加肥料一至二成，同时已开始注意了肥料的质量，如长治专区大部村庄将玉蜀黍杆切碎，用圊粪灌过，再压一层土，使粪沤透，在肥源方面，城粪下乡已成为贮肥的重要一环，察省张家口、大同、宣化三市组织了大量的垃圾粪便下乡，如万全县沙家庄四十五户的统计，不到一个月，即去万全掏大粪二百六十多车，北京市计划将市内粪干二千万斤贷与郊区农民，江苏一带，积极挖河泥，准备了大量的肥料。苏北导治沂河，山东导沭整沂，皖北修整堤圩，江西鄱阳湖，湖北洞庭湖的滨湖溃堤，湖北江汉溃堤，均已动工，进行修整。河北计划在今年打井五万眼，推广水车七万辆，扩大水田一百五十万亩，现已有一千七百一十六座砖窑赶烧井砖，三百四十四个水车工厂赶制水车，今春即可出货三万七千六百八十六辆，成安县在十一月下旬即已打井五百三十眼。山西汾河流域百万亩冬浇运动，现已开始。在修理与补充农具上，山西省供销社以九百万斤米经营与扶植华北著名的荫城与阳泉铁货农具业，因而该两地铁货农具业得到很大的发展，即以荫城附近壶关五区的统计来看，大小方炉已由五座增至三十四座，增加几达七倍。察省通过订合同的方法，生产农具十四万件，平原省拟定了增加农具百万件的计划，亦在积极进行中。其他牲畜的增加，山地的叠埂、打柴、煤矿区附近的运煤等等都在不少地区开展起来。山西省在长期计划的方针下，训练了一千二百多农业干部，以便加强农业生产的技术领导，并开展了秋季造林，计荒山播种二万六千六百七十九亩，重点造林三十三万八千七百九十九株，采集树籽五万四千一百九十四斤。
            二、冬季副业生产
    今年的冬季副业生产，在城乡互助和内外交流的新的形势下，已有很大的发展与新的特点，即由战时自给自足的经济体系，逐渐过渡到根据国内外市场需要的，比较有组织有计划的经济体系，特别在交换关系上，国营经济，以与供销社签订合同的办法，把农民的小生产组织起来的合同制，已开始在东北、华北等地开展起来，有力的推进了这一过渡改组的工作。如在东北黑龙江省有合作总社与黑龙江碱厂订立推销土碱合同，并通过合同，计划推销肉五百八十一万斤，药材三十二万斤及毛皮鱼类等大宗副产品。东北、山东、河北、平原的皮硝河北，山东的草帽辫、土布，山西的核桃、麻皮、油籽、药材、铁货、硫黄，东北的兽皮，察绥的粮食、羊毛、胡麻油，各地的猪鬃等，都大量的吸收到合同制中来，得到广大的销路。这样，就把广大的小生产者组织到国营经济的领导之下，如山西长治专区，在一个不长的时期中，合同制即把该专区贸易总额的百分之八十吸收过来。这意味着农村副业经济的一个重要改组，由分散自给的经济，改组成为一个国家计划的经济，国家可以根据国际贸易，城市工业需要与农村的需要，采取分级负责，订立不同合同的办法，有计划的领导农民小生产者进行生产，大大的克服了盲目性，因此也就保证了农村副业生产品的销路，使得国家需要的副业生产，得到了恢复与发展，如河北省青县等八县的皮硝业，据八百五十一组二千一百三十五户的统计，已发展到月产一百十九万八千六百○四斤，山西阳泉矿区恢复了五百十三座硫磺矿，因而恢复了农民的购买力，使得农业生产与工业品市场的恢复成为可能，如东北松江穆棱区，拉木、采木、采山参、打鱼、打柴、织草袋等，自七月至九月即收入一百四十二亿元；同时保证了外销物资的换取机器与城市工业原料的供给；反过来又按农民的需要，有计划的订立合同，廉价的供给农民工业品，减少了农工业产品价格的剪刀差额，如绥远和林县黑拉窑在过去须以六斗七升胡麻方能从私商手中换到一匹土布，而现在仅以二斗七升胡麻即能换到，改善了农民生活。在新区，结合了群众运动，通过了国家经济的收购，推动了一些副业生产，如湖北沔阳贸易分公司及土产公司，即购进鱼十九万斤，土布三万二千斤又六百匹，麻绳三千斤，苎麻七千斤等等。
            三、生产救灾
    河北苏北山东等灾区都在“不饿死一个人，不荒一亩地”的口号下，积极行动起来，因而一方面开展了各种各样的副业生产，一方面采集野菜代食品渡荒，如宿迁灾民在庭园种青菜五十余万亩，沿海湖地区则结网捕鱼，苏北区台北县，七个区灾民半月赚粮三百多担，除自家吃用外，还能照顾困难户；阜阳专区组织七百五十四个作鞋组，赚米四百四十多万斤，如山东尼山专区，集菜一千四百余万斤。麓水县北庄区秦王庄共产党支部通过各种会议，领导全村群众算细账，订备荒计划，以晒菜、集糠、割山草、运粮、卖油、纺织、织口袋等办法，作到全村无闲人，这样每天全村平均赚粮三百六十五斤，至春耕时能收入三万二千○四十斤，平阴县组织靠山地区群众四千人打石头，现已打一万二千八百七十八方，已卖掉四千○四十方，共得小米六万五千○三十斤。另有十二村已割山柴六十九万九千五百斤，靠湖之东平县已组织舢船三百只捕鱼，并组织妇女结网，在生产工作开展好的地区，灾民逃荒现象已停止。
    根据以上不完整的材料来看，当前冬季生产运动不论在农业生产的准备，副业生产的开展以及生产救灾上都取得了很大成绩，但其发展相当不平衡，一般老区、灾区，冬季生产工作开展的比较好，已在行政和经济的结合下，有领导有计划有步骤的开展起来，而在新区，在非灾区，大部是布置号召多，具体组织检查少，因而形成自流现象，在老区及灾区个别地区也有领导上重视不够，忙于其他工作，放松领导的现象，如河北通县、平原的梁山县等地；也有某些地区方针不够明确，如东北只提副业生产，没有提到农业生产的准备工作，亦有的地区只注意了农业生产的准备工作，而忽视了副业生产；某些地区，仍然严重的存在着盲目性，缺乏调查研究，不根据国家市场及群众的需要，而主观的制定计划，强迫群众执行，以上各种偏向，都严重的妨碍了冬季生产的全面开展。
