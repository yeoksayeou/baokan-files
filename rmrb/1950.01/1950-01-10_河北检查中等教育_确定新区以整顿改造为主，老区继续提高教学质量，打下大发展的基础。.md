    Hebei Inspects Secondary Education
    Determines New Areas Should Focus on Consolidation and Reform, While Old Areas Continue to Improve Teaching Quality and Lay the Foundation for Great Development.
    [Report from our Hebei office] The Hebei Provincial People's Government held a provincial secondary education conference in mid-December of last year, conducting a preliminary review of secondary education throughout the province over the past year, and determining the guidelines for 1950. Currently, the province has 179 secondary schools with 30,694 students. Since the North China Secondary Education Conference and the former North China People's Government put forward the policy of improving secondary education in the old areas and consolidating secondary education in the new areas, old areas such as Handan and Linqing have overcome the tendency to emphasize politics and undervalue culture, as well as the over-participation in social activities and production labor. Significant progress has also been made in improving students' health and cultivating their lively, cheerful, and active spirit. In particular, remarkable achievements have been made in uniting and transforming old teachers and intellectuals in the new areas. Schools in new areas such as Tangshan and Qinhuangdao have seen great gains in transforming the ideological awareness of teachers and students, enhancing political understanding, especially in transforming teachers' hired-labor mentality, establishing the idea of serving the people, and correcting the practice of only teaching and not guiding in teaching methods. However, both new and old areas still have many shortcomings, especially the continuation and revival of the old formalistic tendencies, such as a purely cultural perspective, teaching students to study mechanically, and mechanically applying textbooks in teaching methods. Secondly, the phenomenon of administrative leadership's empiricism and busywork remains serious in some schools, such as unclear responsibilities, unclear division of labor, unsound working systems, complacency, and a lack of a spirit of striving for improvement.
    The old morality, intellect, and physical education were formalistic and individualistic; the new morality, intellect, and physical education are realistic and serve the people.
    In order to clarify the future policy of consolidating, enriching, and improving the quality of secondary education, the conference also put forward the secondary education policy for 1950, which is mainly consolidation and enrichment, development under possible conditions, and orientation towards workers and peasants. New areas will basically focus on consolidation and reform, while old areas will continue to improve teaching quality and students' cultural level, promote creativity, summarize experience, and increase equipment as much as possible to lay the foundation for great development. In order to continue to deeply implement this policy, it is first necessary to clarify the new democratic education, that is, the balanced development of morality, intellect, and physical education; but it is essentially different from the past so-called "equal emphasis on morality, intellect, and physical education." In the past, it was formalistic and individualistic; now, it is realistic, connected to reality, and serves the people. To enable students to have the idea of serving the people, have a certain working ability, have a secondary cultural level, have a lively and cheerful spirit, and a healthy body. At the same time, appropriate attention should be paid to developing students' individuality. Regarding the issue of students' future career paths after graduation, the leadership should make it clear that the choice of further education and employment should be based on the needs of the work, and oppose individualistic and unrealistic ideas. In order to further improve ideological and political education and develop the idea of serving the people, it is necessary to focus on strengthening the connection with reality and implement ideological and political education throughout the entire educational process in a planned, organized, and step-by-step manner. In cultural education, according to the school system, within a certain period of time, the principle of reaching a secondary cultural level and basic scientific knowledge should be achieved. Research should be conducted in connection with the specific situation of the students, so that the content and quantity of teaching materials are appropriately selected. Strengthen the guidance of teaching and research meetings and the assignments outside the classroom of each subject, so as to achieve organic cooperation and planned and organized work. In teaching methods, overcome the phenomenon of mechanically applying dogma and advocate paying attention to practical effects. Collective preparation, mutual listening to lectures, implementation of democracy in teaching, and planned top-down and bottom-up inspection work should be carried out to effectively summarize experiences and lessons learned. On the other hand, students' learning should also be planned for pre-study, review, and extracurricular study, and small group discussions. Promote unity and friendship, and establish voluntary learning assistance organizations. Regarding improving students' health, the leadership of each school must pay attention to research, inspection, and summarization from various aspects, strive to take the initiative, and achieve a balanced development of morality, intellect, and physical education.

    河北检查中等教育
    确定新区以整顿改造为主，老区继续提高教学质量，打下大发展的基础。
    【本报河北讯】河北省人民政府于去年十二月中旬召开的全省中等教育会议上，对全省中等教育作了一年来的初步检查，并确定了一九五○年的方针。现全省共有中等学校一七九处，学生三○六九四名。自华北中等教育会议及前华北人民政府提出提高老区中等教育与整顿新区中等教育的方针后。一年来如邯郸、临清镇等老区，克服了偏重政治轻视文化的观点，以及过多的参加社会活动和生产劳动等偏向；对锻炼学生健康和培养学生活泼愉快积极的精神，亦有了很大进步。尤其在团结改造旧教员与新区知识分子方面，更获得了显著的成绩。唐山、秦皇岛等新区学校，在改造师生思想意识，提高政治认识，特别是改造教师的雇佣观点，树立为人民服务的思想及教学方法上纠正了只教不导的做法，都有很大收获。但目前无论新区与老区还都存在着不少缺点，尤其是旧的正规化偏向的继续与复活，如单纯的文化观点，教育学生死读书，以及在教学方法上的死搬书本。其次是有些学校行政领导的经验主义、事务主义的忙乱现象仍很严重，如职责不明、分工不清、工作制度不健全、满足现状、缺乏力求改进的精神。
    旧的德智体育是形式的，个人主义的；新的德智体育是实事求是的，为人民服务的。
    为明确今后整顿充实提高中等教育质量的方针，会议上又提出一九五○年的中等教育方针，主要是整顿充实，在可能条件下发展，方向是面向工农。新区基本上以整顿改造为主，老区是继续提高教学质量与学生的文化水平、发扬创造，总结经验，量力增加设备，打下大发展的基础。为继续深入贯彻这一方针，首先应明确新民主主义的教育，即德、智、体的平衡发展；但它与过去所谓“德智体并重”有本质的不同。过去是形式的、个人主义的，现在是实事求是的联系实际的，是为人民服务的。使学生具有为人民服务的思想，有一定的工作能力，有中等文化水平，有活泼愉快的精神，健康的身体。同时适当注意到发展学生个性。对学生毕业后的出路问题，领导上应明确：升学与就业的选择应根据工作需要，反对个人主义好高骛远的思想。为进一步提高思想政治教育，发展为人民服务的思想，要有重点，加强联系实际，把思想政治教育贯彻在全部教育过程中，有计划、有组织、有步骤的进行。在文化教育方面，根据学制，在一定时期之内，达到具有中等文化及基本科学知识的原则，联系学生具体情况，加以研究，使教材内容与分量选择恰当。加强教导会议及各科教学课外作业的指导，作到有机配合与有计划有组织。教学方法上，克服死搬教条现象，提倡讲求实际效果。集体准备，互相听课，实行教学的民主，有计划地自上而下与自下而上地进行检查工作，切实总结经验教训。另一方面，学生的学习也应有计划地作到预习、复习和课外学习，小组讨论。要发扬团结友爱，建立自愿组织的学习互助。对增进学生健康，各学校领导上，必须从多方面注意研究、检查、总结，争取主动，达到德智体三育平衡发展。
