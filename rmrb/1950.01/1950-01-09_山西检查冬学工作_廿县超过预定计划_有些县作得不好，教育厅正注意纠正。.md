    【本报太原通讯】Shanxi Province's winter literacy movement, according to the Education Department's inspection report, has exceeded planned targets in some areas with a relatively sound foundation: The Xingxian Special District originally planned to open 619 winter literacy schools, but has now reached 1,051; the seventeen counties under the Changzhi, Fenyang, and Yicheng Special Districts, totaling 2,240 administrative villages, have opened 4,558 winter literacy schools, averaging more than two winter literacy schools per administrative village, also exceeding the original plan of an average of one and a half winter literacy schools per administrative village for the entire province. The number of people participating in winter literacy schools is also very enthusiastic, with 84,197 people in seven counties in the Fenyang Special District alone.

            Leadership at All Levels Attaches Importance to Winter Literacy Work, Many Regions Organize Inspections and Supervision

    From the beginning of the winter literacy movement to the current stage, the leadership of each special district and county has attached great importance to this movement. In the collective training of volunteer teachers, the main responsible cadres in each county personally participated and presided over the training. The county heads and the heads of the Propaganda Departments of the Chinese Communist Party committees in counties such as Lucheng even personally gave lectures to the winter literacy teachers. In the deployment of winter literacy work, each special county began preparing and deploying before the promulgation of the North China People's Government's Implementation Outline for Winter Literacy. Each county universally combined the Chinese Communist Party's Party Representative Conference to carry out the planning, mobilization, and deployment of winter literacy. The Jiaocheng County Government's Judicial Section, Construction Section, Public Security Bureau, Cultural Center, and Chinese and Western Medicine Research Association, and other five departments, compiled popular teaching materials on marriage, winter production, public security, anti-superstition, and health for winter literacy application. Licheng County conducted a planned survey of illiteracy in five key villages, formulated a comprehensive winter literacy plan, and compiled a winter literacy handbook for carrying out the winter literacy movement. Many regions paid attention to organizing inspections and supervision, such as the Yicheng Special District, which transferred trained teachers to provide on-site guidance to winter literacy schools. Changzi, Jincheng, Zuoquan and other counties dispatched relevant cadres to organize inspections and supervision to promote the winter literacy movement. Qinyuan used the Chengguan District as a base point to create experience and promote the winter literacy work throughout the county.

            Masses Give Play to Creativity and Improve Teaching Methods

    Due to the promotion and publicity of the leadership, the general public attaches importance to winter literacy learning. For example, Duanjiazhuang and Dongguan Village in Licheng County prepared winter literacy teaching aids before the winter literacy movement. In the Xingxian Special District, Chinese Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members took the lead in attending winter literacy schools, creating a wave of enthusiasm for the winter literacy movement. In this stage of learning, achievements have begun to be shown. A ten-day summary of 95 students in Zhangjiashan, Licheng County, showed that the advanced class learned an average of 25 characters each, and the elementary class learned an average of 14 characters, and learned the national anthem. When women in the village were tested on political and health knowledge, ten people scored above 80 points, twenty-seven scored above 60 points, and only nine failed. In Banzhuang Village, Fangshan County, many young people learned more than 40 new characters in two weeks. In the development of the winter literacy movement, the masses gave play to creativity to improve learning methods. For example, the Changzhi Shengli Street Winter Literacy School divided students into three groups according to their cultural level: those who were illiterate joined the literacy group, those who were roughly literate joined the remedial class, and those who were more cultured formed a research group, using this group as the core to promote the other two groups. Teaching methods were also gradually improved according to the opinions of the masses. In promoting various tasks, winter literacy has also played a certain role. For example, the Jiaocheng Beiguan Street Winter Literacy School educated farmers to accumulate more fertilizer, creating a wave of fertilizer accumulation throughout the street, and now more than 10,000 dan of fertilizer have been accumulated.

    However, the development of winter literacy throughout the province is still uneven. According to the inspection report of the Education Department's inspection team to the Yuci Special District, in some places in Yuci, Taigu and other counties, the winter literacy movement had not yet been effectively carried out by December 15th of last year. Individual villages in Pingshun and Lucheng adopted compulsory measures, such as fining oil, to force farmers not to be absent. Some individual villages did not analyze the thoughts of the masses and solve ideological obstacles, but one-sidedly emphasized voluntary registration for school, resulting in a small number of students. In some areas, the winter literacy movement was not combined with winter production, land reform and other work. For example, in Taigu, when conveying winter literacy instructions, they did not dare to notify the district education assistants to participate, "fearing it would affect the central work." Winter literacy textbooks have not been fully resolved in various places, affecting the development of winter literacy work. In some places, the teaching time and textbook ratio do not meet the regulations of the provincial government, which will affect the completion of the winter literacy education task. The Education Department is paying attention to correcting these shortcomings.

    山西检查冬学工作
    廿县超过预定计划
    有些县作得不好，教育厅正注意纠正。
    【本报太原通讯】山西省的冬学运动，据教育厅的检查报告，在一些较有基础的地区，冬学数量已超过预定计划：兴县专区原计划开办冬学六一九座，现已达一○五一座；长治、汾阳、翼城三个专区所属的十七个县，共二二四○个行政村，已开办冬学四五五八座，平均每一行政村有冬学两座多，亦超过了原定全省平均每一行政村有冬学一座半的计划。参加冬学的人数也很踊跃，汾阳专区七个县就有八万四千一百九十七人。
            各级领导重视冬学工作不少地区组织视导检查
    从冬学运动开始到目前这一阶段，各专区与县的领导方面都比较重视这一运动。在集训义务教员上，各县主要负责干部都亲自参加主持，潞城等县县长、中共县委宣传部长等并亲自给冬学教员上课。在冬学工作布置上，各专县在前华北人民政府冬学实施纲要颁发前就已着手准备和布置；各县普遍结合了中国共产党的党代表会议，进行了冬学的计划、动员与布置。交城县政府司法科、建设科、公安局、文化馆、中西医药研究会等五部门，分编了婚姻、冬季生产、治安、反迷信、卫生等通俗教材，以供冬学应用；黎城县曾有计划地进行了五个重点村的文盲调查，拟出全面的冬学计划，并编有冬学手册，供开展冬学运动之用。不少地区注意了组织检查与视导工作，如翼城专区抽调受过训的教员实地辅导冬学；长子、晋城、左权等县抽出有关干部，组织了推进冬学运动的视导检查；沁源以城关区为基点，创造经验，推动了全县冬学工作。
            群众发挥创造性改进教学方法
    由于领导上的推动宣传，一般群众均重视冬学学习。如黎城段家庄、东关村等，在冬学运动之前就准备冬学教学用具；兴县专区各地中共党员与青年团员带头上冬学，造成冬学运动的热潮。在这一阶段的学习中，已开始显出成绩。黎城县张家山九十五人学习十天总结，高级班每人平均学了二十五个字，低级班平均识十四字，学会了国歌；该村的妇女测验政治卫生常识，十人得八十分以上，二十七人得六十分以上，仅九人不及格；方山县班庄村冬学，两星期中不少青年学会四十余个生字。在冬学运动开展中，群众发挥创造性，来改进学习方法，如长治胜利街冬学，依据群众文化程度分为三组：不识字的参加识字组，粗通文字的参加补习班，比较有文化的成立研究组，以这组为核心推动其他两组；教学方式亦根据群众意见逐步改进。在推动各项工作方面，冬学也已起了一定作用，如交城北关街冬学即曾教育农民多多积肥，全街遂造成积肥热潮，现已积肥一万余担。
    但全省冬学在开展上还不平衡，据教育厅视导组到榆次专区视导报告，榆次、太谷等县有些地方，到去年十二月十五日，冬学运动还未切实办起来。平顺、潞城个别村，则采用强迫命令方式，以罚油等办法来强制农民不缺席；也有个别村庄不分析群众思想，解决思想障碍，片面强调自愿报名上学，结果上学人数很少。有的地区冬学运动与冬季生产、土地改革等工作未结合进行，如太谷传达冬学指示，不敢通知区教育助理员参加，“怕影响了中心工作”。各地冬学课本未得完全解决，影响了冬学工作的开展。有的地方教学时间与教材比重，不符合省府指示的规定，势将影响完成冬学教育任务。这些缺点，教育厅正注意纠正中。
