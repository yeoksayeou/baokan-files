    Shijiazhuang Railway Factory Moving Forward
    The factory has gradually improved management and embarked on a standardized production path, and has recently launched a rationalization proposal and innovation record movement.

    When mentioning the Shijiazhuang Railway Factory, people living in Shijiazhuang, and even those in neighboring counties, know that it is the largest and best-equipped factory in Shijiazhuang.
    According to current figures, there are 1,176 staff members in the factory, with indirect production personnel accounting for 13% of the total. In terms of production equipment, there are 100 machine tools alone, 281 auxiliary machines, and a total ventilation capacity of 275 horsepower. Among the machine tools, it possesses the city's largest gantry planer and the city's only cylinder milling machine, as well as various types of lathes, planers, milling machines, and shapers.
    Since it is only a repair shop, its work is divided into nine production sections according to the nature of the work: locomotive (formerly known as renovation), rolling stock, machining, repair and distribution, boiler making, casting, forging, power (formerly known as electrical), and general tooling. The assisting departments are divided into four sections/warehouses: work, personnel, accounting, and materials. The factory's production tasks mainly involve repairing locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars, as well as producing parts for locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars, and iron parts needed for railway lines. What is even more commendable is that it can cast locomotive cylinders. The melting capacity of the factory's existing cupola can handle such large jobs, which is rare among the twelve railway factories in North China.

Productivity (Calculated According to the Ministry of Railways' Monthly Highest Record) | Locomotives | 6.2 | 5 | 7.6
| Passenger Cars | 5 | 5 | 9
| Freight Cars | 50 | 45 | 68

     According to the above brief comparison table, the current factory's main finished product productivity: the monthly output of locomotives has increased by 22.6% or 80% compared to the periods of Japanese occupation and Kuomintang rule, while the labor force is smaller than in the past.
    The factory's trade union organization is led by the Shijiazhuang office of the Taiyuan Railway General Trade Union, and more than 98% of the factory's employees have joined the trade union. The Communist Youth League organization also has a certain foundation; the organization of the Communist Party of China has a long history in this factory. The factory was one of the bases of the "February 7th" Movement in 1922; there are still 23 veteran workers who participated in the struggle working in the factory. According to recent statistics, Communist Party members account for more than 21.5% of the current 1,176 employees. It has a glorious tradition in the history of the labor movement, so the class consciousness of the workers is relatively high among the state-owned and public-owned factories in Shijiazhuang.
    The factory's growth since liberation has gone through a tortuous path. After the workers understood the party's principles and policies, the four "true words" that had been popular among the workers during the Japanese imperialist and Kuomintang eras – "Learn to dawdle, poop for three o'clock, poop three times a day, pat your butt and go home" – were overthrown.
            Clearly Establish the Concept of Relying on Workers to Improve Production
    In August 1948, Shijiazhuang's unprecedented production competition movement began; this movement not only mobilized the workers' enthusiasm for production, but more importantly, initially clarified the concept of "only by relying on the working class can production be improved" in the minds of cadres.
    In November of the same year, during the war preparation period, the workers completed a week's worth of machine installation tasks in four working days (a total of 32 hours). Subsequently, under the call of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, a city-wide production increase and loss compensation competition movement was launched. The workers did more work in one month than in one and a half months, increasing production by a total of more than 470,000 catties of millet. The "slowpokes" of the old society became activists through this movement.
            Adjust Wages; Mobilize Workers to Use Their Wisdom to Improve Tools and Labor Organization.
    The wage adjustment in March last year initially overcame the serious egalitarian tendencies that had existed since liberation. The workers already had a clear understanding in their minds during the Red May production competition and believed that they could not rely solely on physical strength. The party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League leaders of the factory generally no longer emphasized increasing labor intensity, but instead called on everyone to "use their brains, invent, create, and improve tools and the organization of labor." During this period, everyone was thinking. Engineer Nian Sen successfully imitated American-style long die chasers, young worker Lu Jinrui repaired the injector that had not been working well for twelve years, and old hero Ji Gensheng improved the method of quenching with salt water and the air hammer valve. The rolling stock section reorganized the labor force, and as a result, only eight more foundry workers were added, and six more freight cars could be repaired each month. In terms of leadership, in order to better reflect the spirit of democratic management and meet the workers' demands for "strengthening leadership," after careful discussion, a competition committee office was established. The daily contact between the party, government, and trade union in the factory has since become closer, and the factory's production leadership has gradually overcome the rural-style leadership style that still existed more or less since liberation, so that all work can be carried out with leadership and organization. After further mobilizing the staff to conduct extensive discussions, a regular meeting system was established, and the machine maintenance system and timekeeping system were restored and improved. Preliminary efforts were also made to formulate articles on material consumption standards and man-hour standards. This series of measures enabled the factory's production to steadily move towards a standardized path.
    Closely related to the various systems are the issues of ideological education and cultural and professional learning for employees. This work is directly led by the Party and the Trade Union in the factory. According to the cultural level and work nature of all employees, they are divided into literacy classes, general elementary school classes, and other cultural classes, as well as railway knowledge, locomotive, rolling stock, machining, and drafting and other repair courses. A unified political class and current affairs report are held every Wednesday and Saturday for the entire factory. This study is often connected with the employees' thinking and some specific issues. For example, in the Red May production competition last year, unity and mutual assistance, merit recording, merit evaluation, and the establishment of various systems were all elevated to ideological awareness in the political class.
            Establish a Responsibility System to Enhance Workers' Sense of Ownership
    The various systems have gradually progressed on a certain ideological understanding of the employees, and the issue of division of responsibility for established work is extremely urgent to be resolved. This issue is an important measure to reduce product costs, extend the life of machines and tools, and at the same time reflect the workers' sense of ownership. The factory adopted a relatively meticulous method for this work. First, let the employees discuss "how to be responsible" and "why be responsible"? In response to the employees' feedback, the party, government, and trade union in the factory conducted concise explanations and enlightenments in the political class, and then the production organization class or group proposed individual responsibility regulations. Finally, the responsible covenants were signed at the general meeting of the factory, and the factory department called for the development of mutual assistance movements, so that production work could have a detailed division of labor and be carried out in a connected manner.
            Conditions are Available to Establish Democratic Management Committees at All Levels
    From the above development situation, sufficient conditions have been established to establish various organizational forms of democratic management. The factory began to prepare for the establishment of the management committee. First, employees were mobilized to make criticisms and suggestions for improvement to the factory's leaders at all levels, and then the members of the factory's management committee were carefully selected, and nine production offices also set up sub-management committees. At the establishment meeting of the employee representative meeting, it was decided to learn from the experience of industrial construction in the Soviet Union and Northeast China, and to carry out rationalization proposals and record creation work. At this time (November last year), when the South-North Tongpu Railway and the Shi (Jiazhuang) An (Yang) section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway were actively rushing to repair, the factory assumed the unprecedented arduous task of supplying 180,000 pieces of line equipment. The management committee mobilized employees through various levels of organizations to work hard to complete this huge task. The workers created many unprecedented new records in their work. Li He of the General Tooling Section increased the highest record of more than 500 screws in the Red May competition to 1,045 when tapping six-point screws. Under his leadership, other classes also increased to around 800 screws; the forging section made fishplates. The work section calculated based on manpower and machine efficiency, and at most, no more than 250 pieces could be made per day, but the workers appropriately utilized the labor force and machine movement rate, and as a result, 315 pieces were made in one day; some apprentices' production efficiency approached the figures of the masters. Under such mutual encouragement and influence, this work was successfully completed ten days ahead of schedule.
    Accepting this experience and the employees' opinions, the factory's employee representative meeting formulated an "implementation draft" for carrying out rationalization proposals and record-breaking movements. This draft clearly put forward the scope of construction and the standards for measuring achievements, and at the same time, it also established specific regulations for immediate merit and immediate awards. This work is still developing gradually. Victory can be predicted.

    前进中的石家庄铁路工厂
    该厂已逐渐改善管理，走上正规化的生产道路，最近并已展开合理化建议和创新纪录运动。
    晓洲
    提起石家庄铁路工厂，住在石家庄的人，甚至石家庄邻近各县的人都知道它是石家庄规模最大，设备最全的工厂。
    厂内的工作人员，根据现有的数目是一千一百七十六名，间接生产人员占全数的百分之十三。在生产设备上，单是工作母机就有一百台，辅助机二百八十一部，送风量达二百七十五匹马力。工作母机中拥有全市最大的龙门刨，和全市独一无二的铣缸机，其他旋、刨、铣、擦各型床子都有。
    由于它只是一座修理厂，所以在工作性质上分成机车（旧名装修）、车辆、机工、修配、制炉、铸工、锻工、动力（旧名电机）和总工具等九个生产所，协助生产的分设工作、人事、会计和材料等四课库。该厂的生产任务主要是修理机、客、货车，和生产有关机、客、货车的配件、线路需用的铁件，更难能可贵的是能够铸造机车汽缸，以该厂现有化铁炉的熔量能解决这样的大活，这是在华北十二座铁路工厂中也不多见的。时代类别   日本帝国主义    国民党        现在职工人数   一千七百余人   一千三百余人   一千一百七十六人机器设备   （与现在同）生产力（     机车        六·二台   五台      七·六台按铁道部以   客车        五辆       五辆       九辆一月最高纪   货车       五十辆      四十五辆   六十八辆录折算）
     按照以上的简略比较表，现在该厂的主要成品生产力：每月出厂机车较日寇侵占时期和国民党时期提高了百分之二十二点六或百分之八十，而在劳动力方面则较过去还少一些。
    该厂的工会组织受太原铁路总工会石家庄办事处领导，全厂百分之九十八以上的职工都加入了工会。青年团的组织亦有一定基础；中国共产党的组织在这个厂里是有悠久历史的，一九二二年的“二七”运动，这个厂曾经是根据地之一；现在还有二十三位参加当时斗争的老工友留厂工作。根据最近统计，在现在一千一百七十六名职工中，共产党员占了百分之二十一点五强。工运史上她有着光荣的传统，所以职工阶级觉悟在石市国营、公营工厂中是较高的。
    该厂自解放以来的成长，是经过了一段曲折的道路。当工友们明了了自己政党的方针政策以后，在日本帝国主义和国民党时代曾经在工友们里流行过的“学会磨洋工，拉屎三点钟，一天拉三遍，拍拍屁股就下工”的四句“真言”从此被推翻了。
            明确依靠工人搞好生产的观念
    一九四八年八月，开始了石家庄史无前例的生产竞赛运动；这运动不仅发动了工友们的生产热情，更重要的是在干部思想上初步明确了“只有依靠工人阶级才能搞好生产”的观念。
    同年十一月闹备战，复工的时候，工友们四天工时（共三十二小时）干完了一个礼拜安装机器的任务。接着，在中共石家庄市委会的号召下，展开了全市性的增产补损竞赛运动，工友们一个月干了比一个半月还多的活儿，增产总额达四十七万多斤小米。旧社会的“蘑菇匠”经过这次运动变成了积极分子。
            调整工资；发动工人发挥智慧，改进工具和劳动组织。
    去年三月调整工资，初步克服了自解放以来严重存在的平均主义偏向。红五月闹生产竞赛，工友们心里早就有了底儿，认为光凭力气吃不开。该厂的党、政、工、团的领导一般的也不再强调增加劳动强度，而是号召大家“开动脑筋、发明、创造、改进工具和劳动力的组织”。这期间大家都在捉摸，工务员年森仿造美式长板牙获得成功，青年工人卢金瑞修好了十二年就没闹好的喷油器，老英雄计根生又改进用盐水淬火的办法和风锤胆，车辆所改组劳动力，结果只添了八个铸工，每月即可多修六辆货车。领导上，为了更好的体现民主管理的精神和顺应工友们“加强领导”的要求，经过仔细研讨，成立起竞赛委员会办公室。厂内党、政、工的日常联系，从此更形密切，工厂的生产领导也逐渐克服了自我解放以来还或多或少存在着的农村式的领导作风，使各项工作有领导有组织的进行着。再经过深入动员职工广泛讨论，建立起定期的会议制度，恢复与健全了机器保养制度和记工制度。在材料消耗标准及工时标准上，也初步着手订立条文。这一系列的举措，就使该厂的生产，稳步的走向正规化的道路。
    和各项制度有紧密关连的是职工思想教育和文化、业务的学习问题。这工作在该厂是由党和工会来直接领导。根据全厂职工的文化水平和工作性质，分成识字、普通高小等文化班和铁路常识、机车、车辆、机工和制图等等修配。每礼拜三和礼拜六则举行全厂统一的政治大课和时事报告，这个学习常连系职工思想与一些具体问题。比如去年红五月生产竞赛中的团结互助、记功、评功和各种制度的建立，都在政治大课上提高到思想上来认识。
            建立负责制，提高工人主人翁思想
    各项制度在职工一定的思想认识上逐渐进步，而对于既定工作上的分工负责问题是极待解决的。这个问题是减低产品成本，延续机器和工具寿命，同时更是体现工人主人翁思想的重要举措。该厂对这件工作采取了比较缜密的方法，首先让职工讨论“如何负责”和“为什么要负责”？针对职工的反映，厂内党、政、工分别在政治大课上进行扼要的解释和启示，然后通过生产组织的班或股提出个人负责条例，最后在全厂大会上签署负责文约，厂部并号召展开互助运动，使生产工作能有精细的分工，又有联系的进行。
            条件具备成立各级民主管委会
    从以上的发展情况，建立民主管理的各级组织形式已具备了足够的条件。该厂就开始筹备建立管委会的工作。先发动职工对厂内各级领导提出批评和改进意见，然后再慎重选出全厂的管委会委员，九个生产所也分设所管委会。在职工代表会成立大会上，通过了学习苏联和东北工业建设的经验，开展合理化建议和创造纪录的工作。这时候（去年十一月）正当南北同蒲和京汉路石（家庄）安（阳）段积极抢修，该厂担负了供给线路器材十八万件的空前繁重任务。管委会通过各级组织发动了职工为完成这一繁巨的工作而努力。工友们在工作中创造了很多没有先例的新纪录。总工具所李和，在套六分螺丝时，从红五月竞赛的最高纪录五百多条提高到一千零四十五条，在他的带动下，其他班也增加到八百条上下；锻工所打鱼尾板，工作课根据人力和机器效能计算，每天至多不能超过二百五十块，但工友们合适地利用了劳动力和机器运动率，结果一天打了三百一十五块；有些学徒的生产效能接近了师傅的数字，在这样互相鼓励和影响之下，这件工作就提前十天胜利的完成了。
    接受这个经验和职工们的意见，该厂职工代表会对开展合理化建议和创纪录运动订立出“实施草案”，这个草案明确的提出建设范围和衡量成绩的标准，同时还确立了现功现奖的具体条例。这件工作目前还在逐渐发展。胜利是可以预卜的。
