    Accurately Grasp the Disaster Situation and Achieve Fairness and Reasonableness:
    Grain Procurement in Chahar Province Nearing Completion
    [Our Newspaper Zhangjiakou Dispatch] Grain procurement in Chahar Province is about to be victoriously completed. The Provincial People's Government of Chahar convened a procurement work conference in mid-October last year. Various counties began deploying procurement work in early November, and distribution to households was completed around the 10th of the same month. Due to the active leadership of cadres and the enthusiastic payment by the masses, by December 5th, the Chahar South and Yanbei regions had completed 97% of the total procurement quota, nearing full completion. The deployment in the counties of Chahar North was later due to the impact of epidemic prevention work, but some counties have also achieved great results. For example, Shangyi County had completed 84.6% of the total procurement quota by early December, Zhangbei County completed 80%, and Chongli completed 67%. The main reasons for the province's rapid and victorious completion of the procurement work are three: (1) The leadership attaches great importance and the direction is clear, which is the primary factor for the victorious completion of the work. Under the correct guideline of "conducting procurement around winter production," and drawing on past procurement work experience, it is first necessary to get through the thinking of district and village cadres. On the one hand, explain that the masses in Chahar Province currently have no war service burden and can concentrate on production, and should support the rapid liberation of the whole country from an economic perspective. At the same time, the method of accounting is used to compare this year's burden with previous years to increase the confidence of cadres in completing the procurement. For areas where the disaster situation is truly serious, reductions and exemptions from procurement are granted based on the actual situation. (2) After serious discussions by the masses, the allocation is fair and reasonable. When allocating burdens, all villages fully promoted democracy, and repeatedly discussed and studied through joint meetings of village cadres, meetings of villagers' representatives, and mass meetings to determine the burden and exemption amount for each household, and generally achieved three announcements to finalize the decision. (3) Due to the complete liberation of Chahar Province, the people's lives are moving towards stability, feudal forces have bowed their heads or been overthrown, and coupled with the encouragement of the victorious situation across the country, the masses' consciousness has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and they are enthusiastically paying public grain. Gao Cuifeng (female), a new member of the Communist Youth League in Hunyuan County, Yanbei, led eight women to travel seventy miles back and forth to deliver 850 jin of public grain. Li Hongwu, the secretary of the Communist Party branch in Jinjiazhuang Village in the county, led all party members in the village to pay public grain early. Under the influence of the party members, the entire village completed the procurement task in seven days. (Lü Guangming)

    确实掌握灾情作到公平合理
    察省征粮接近完成
    【本报张家口专讯】察哈尔省公粮征收即将胜利完成。该省人民政府于去年十月中旬召开征收工作会议，十一月初旬各县开始布置征收，同月十日左右即分配到户。由于干部积极领导，群众踊跃缴纳，十二月五日，察南、雁北地区即完成全部征收数字的百分之九十七，已接近全部完成。察北各县因受防疫工作影响，布置较晚，但有些县份亦已获得很大成绩，如尚义县在十二月上旬已完成全部征收数字的百分之八十四点六，张北县完成百分之八十，崇礼完成百分之六十七。该省迅速胜利完成征收工作，主要原因有三：（一）领导重视，方针明确，这是胜利完成工作的首要因素。在“围绕冬季生产进行征收”的正确方针下，接受过去征收工作的经验，首先要打通区、村干部的思想，一方面说明当前察省群众已没有战勤负担，可以安心生产，应该从经济方面来支援全国的迅速解放；同时并用算账的办法，把今年负担与往年相比，以提高干部完成征收的信心。对灾情确实严重的地区，则根据实情予以减免征收。（二）经过群众认真讨论，分配公平合理。各村在分配负担时，都充分发扬民主，先后经过村干部联席会、村民代表会、群众大会的反复讨论与研究，确定各户负担量与应减免量，一般都做到三榜定案。（三）由于察省全部解放，人民生活走向安定，封建势力已经低头或被打倒，加之全国胜利形势的鼓舞，群众觉悟空前提高，踊跃交纳公粮。雁北浑源县新青团员高翠凤（女），率领八个妇女往返七十里送交公粮八百五十斤。该县金家庄中共支部书记李洪武领导全村党员早交公粮，在党员影响下，全村七天完成征收任务。      （吕光明）
