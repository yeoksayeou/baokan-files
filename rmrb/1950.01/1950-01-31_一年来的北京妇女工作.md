Beijing Women's Work in the Past Year
*Beijing Women* Magazine

Since the establishment of the Women's Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation after liberation, in accordance with the general direction of the city's restoration and development of production, the working principle has been determined as focusing on women workers' work, mobilizing and organizing women's production. Around this principle, women and children's welfare and women's cultural and educational work have been carried out.

In terms of restoring and organizing women's production, the first step was to select and send cadres to factories with a relatively high concentration of women workers to cooperate with the preparatory committee of the Trade Union Federation to carry out women workers' work. Secondly, organize working women in various districts to engage in handicraft production and seasonal temporary production. At the same time, conduct typical experiments. On the one hand, take over the Kuomintang relief agency "Women's Handicraft Factory," transform and develop it, thereby exploring factory management and women workers' work experience; on the other hand, organize skilled embroidery workers to establish small-scale women's embroidery factories, thereby exploring the experience of restoring and developing Beijing's famous special handicraft.

Over the past year, a total of 4,887 women workers in state-owned and private industries, handicraft women workers, and female shop assistants in the city participated in trade unions, accounting for 81 percent. Those participating in learning accounted for 81.5 percent. 350 people became glorious Communist Party members, and 721 became members of the Communist Youth League. The women workers broke with the view of fate and superstitious ideas, established the view that labor is glorious, and actively learned technology, taking the restoration and development of Beijing's production as their glorious responsibility. The women workers in the clothing factory showed great results in rushing to produce summer clothes recently. The ninth class (women workers' class) of the first factory consistently ranked first in the production performance of all classes in the factory in the first month, and also drove the male workers' class; the first class of the second factory, which was mostly women workers, also ranked first in the factory. At present, such outstanding production achievements can be easily found in many factories. According to statistics in December of last year, 3,706 working women in various districts have been organized into production successively. These women not only solved family economic problems, but also organized themselves in the production process, improved their awareness, strengthened their spirit of unity and mutual assistance, and emerged a large number of activists. After transformation and development, the Women's Handicraft Factory has not only been transformed from a relief agency into a completely self-sufficient production department, but also added motors, gradually moving towards the road of modern motorized production. In addition, they also organized their own trade unions.

In addition to women workers and working women, women from other strata have also made great progress. For example, female students, female teachers, rural women in suburban areas, medical staff, childcare workers, cultural workers, opera workers, and women from all walks of life, as well as some housewives, have been gradually organized through the education of mass organizations such as student federations and teacher federations, and the struggle of land reform. After learning and transformation, they have all made great progress. The idea that labor is glorious has been universally established among women from all walks of life. The wives of professors at Tsinghua University have also carried out various production activities such as grinding tofu and making clothes. Even prostitutes who were liberated not long ago have begun to overcome parasitic thoughts and recognize the significance of labor being glorious.

Preliminary achievements have indeed been made in organizing women's production in the past year, but the following shortcomings have existed in the work: (1) Insufficient investigation and research. In the work of women workers, in the initial stage, there was neglect in actively understanding and studying the ideological situation of women workers. Worker education mainly used large-class methods, subjectively and rigidly instilling, instead of starting from the degree that workers could accept. In the cultivation of activists, little attention was paid to starting with excellent women workers in production. In the organization of working women's production in various districts, the shortcomings of blind production were quite common before May of last year, and production could not find a market. (2) Some cadres did not clearly recognize that improving technology and quality is the main key to opening up sales, but treated production with a relief view, which made production unable to improve, products did not meet specifications, and affected the smooth development of women's production work. (3) Women's production was carried out in isolation, without close cooperation with all parties, such as unified leadership with the Cooperative Federation, Trading Company, and Cooperative Bank, which caused difficulties in the work. These shortcomings have been basically overcome in the past year's work exploration.

In terms of women and children's welfare work, the Municipal Women's Federation, with the Beihai Experimental Nursery as the center, established contact with nurseries throughout the city, held a symposium of nursery principals once a month to exchange experiences, discuss business, hold political lectures, and assist childcare workers in their studies. In addition, the Wai San District and the Health Bureau jointly established a maternal and child health experimental area, conducted a survey of the family status and diseases of mothers and children, and established an outpatient department to treat maternal and child diseases.

In terms of women's cultural and educational work, the Municipal Women's Federation conducted publicity and education through various forms such as lectures, news, radio, and recreational activities. The Municipal Women's Federation also publishes the monthly magazine *Beijing Women* to connect with and educate the broad masses of women. The women's work groups and cultural and educational sections of various districts, in coordination with the Municipal Education Bureau's unified leadership, held adult night schools and women's literacy classes. According to statistics in December of last year, a total of 9,000 people participated (excluding women workers). In winter schools in suburban areas, women also accounted for about half of the number of winter school students.

Since the first Beijing Women's Congress was held in November of last year and the Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation was formally established, the connection between women from all walks of life has been strengthened. At present, the most urgent demands of the broad masses of women in Beijing are to participate in production, solve life problems, solve cultural and political education, as well as marriage and childcare problems. Therefore, the working principle of Beijing women in 1950 should be: with production as the center, vigorously organize women to participate in production, and, where possible, gradually strengthen the cultural and political education of the broad masses of women, and promote women and children's welfare undertakings.

    一年来的北京妇女工作
    《北京妇女》社
    解放后，中共北京市妇女工作委员会与市民主妇联筹委会成立以来，根据全市恢复与发展生产的总方向，确定工作方针是以女工工作为中心，发动与组织妇女生产。围绕着这个方针，开展妇女儿童福利和妇女文化教育工作。
    在恢复与组织妇女生产方面，首先是选派干部到女工比较集中的工厂中，配合总工会筹委会，开展女工工作。其次，组织各区劳动妇女，从事手工业生产和季节性的临时生产。同时，进行典型试验，一方面接管国民党救济机关“妇女手工厂”，加以改造和发展，从而摸索工厂管理与女工工作经验；另一方面组织熟练挑补花女工，创办小规模的妇女挑补花工厂，从而摸索恢复与发展北京市这一著名的特种手工艺的经验。
    一年来，全市公私营产业女工、手工业女工和店员女工共四千八百八十七人，参加工会的占百分之八十一，参加学习的占百分之八十一·五，有三百五十人成了光荣的共产党员，七百二十一人成了青年团员。女工们打破了命运观点与迷信思想，建立了劳动光荣的观点，并且积极地学习技术，以恢复和发展北京市的生产引为自己的光荣责任。被服厂女工在最近赶制夏服时表现了很大的成绩，一厂九班（女工班）第一个月内始终占全厂各班生产成绩的第一位，而且带动了男工班；二厂女工占多数的第一班产量也居全厂第一。目前这种突出的生产成绩，在许多工厂中都不难找到。各区劳动妇女，先后组织到生产中的，据去年十二月统计有三千七百零六人。这些妇女，不但解决了家庭经济问题，而且在生产过程中组织起来，提高了觉悟，加强了团结互助精神，涌现出了大批积极分子。妇女手工厂经过改造和发展，不但已从救济性质的机关变成完全自给的生产部门，而且增设了电机，逐步向近代化电机生产的道路迈进。此外，她们还组织了自己的工会。
    除了女工和劳动妇女外，其他阶层的妇女，也有很大的进步。如女学生、女教员、郊区农妇、医护、保育、文化、戏曲等各界妇女和部分家庭妇女，通过学联、教联等群众团体的教育和土地改革等的斗争，都逐步组织起来了。经过学习与改造后都有很大进步。劳动光荣的思想在各阶层妇女中已普遍建立起来。清华的教授太太们也进行了磨豆腐、做衣服等各种各样的生产活动。连解放不久的妓女也开始克服了寄生思想，认识了劳动光荣的意义。
    一年来在组织妇女生产中确已取得了初步的成绩，但是工作中曾经存在过以下缺点：（一）调查研究不够。在女工工作上，初期忽视了主动地去了解和研究女工思想情况，对工人教育主要地是用上大课方式，主观地、生硬地灌输，而不从工人能够接受的程度出发。对积极分子的培养，很少注意从生产上优秀的女工着手。各区在组织劳动妇女生产上，去年五月以前相当普遍的存在盲目生产的缺点，生产了找不到销路。（二）部分干部没有明确认识提高技术与质量是打开销路的主要关键，而以救济观点对待生产，致使生产不能提高，产品不合规格，影响妇女生产工作的顺利开展。（三）把妇女生产孤立进行，没有密切地与各方配合，如与合作总社、贸易公司、合作银行等统一领导，致使工作遭遇困难。这些缺点在过去一年的工作摸索中，已基本上克服了。
    在妇女儿童福利工作上，市妇联以北海实验托儿所为中心，建立了与全市托儿所的联系，每月召开一次托儿所负责人座谈会，交流经验，研讨业务，举办政治讲座，协助保育人员学习。此外，在外三区和卫生局合办了妇婴卫生实验区，对妇婴的家庭状况与疾病进行了调查，并设立门诊部，进行妇婴疾病治疗。
    在妇女文化教育工作上，市妇联通过各种形式，如讲演、新闻、广播和游艺会等，进行宣传教育。市妇联并出版《北京妇女》月刊，用以联系与教育广大妇女群众。各区妇女工作组和文教科配合，在市教育局统一领导下，举办成人夜校和妇女识字班，参加的人数，据去年十二月统计，共九千人（女工在外）。在郊区冬学中，妇女参加人数也占冬学人数的一半左右。
    自从去年十一月北京市召开第一次妇女代表大会，北京市民主妇联正式成立后，更加强了各阶层妇女的联系。目前北京市广大的妇女最迫切的要求是参加生产，解决生活问题，解决文化政治教育以及婚姻和托儿问题。因此在一九五○年北京市妇女的工作方针应该是：以生产为中心，大力组织妇女参加生产，并在可能条件下，逐步加强对广大妇女的文化政治教育，推进妇女儿童福利事业。
