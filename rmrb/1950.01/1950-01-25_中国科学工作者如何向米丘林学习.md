    How Chinese Scientific Workers Should Learn from Michurin
    Chen Fengtong

    Michurin was a scientist and a dialectical materialist. He used his diligent labor to find experience from countless failures; he used practical experience to refute the idealistic theories of Weismann, Morgan, and Mendel, who believed that things in the world were immutable and therefore could not develop, and shattered them with ironclad facts. He also absorbed and developed Darwin's theory of evolution, making it serve the practical life of mankind and opening up the only path that biologists around the world, especially agricultural scientists, should follow. Michurin's great achievement lies here, and that's why he was valued by Lenin and Stalin.

    Michurin's greatness also lies in his love for his motherland and his love for the people of his motherland. He resolutely refused the American imperialists and American bourgeois scholars who wanted to move him and his orchard to the United States. Michurin never interrupted his research work during the hard and bumpy life he suffered in the Tsarist era.

    Michurin's success lies in the fact that he did not talk empty words, but honestly faced reality, seeking truth from countless experiments, finding the laws of nature, and mastering these laws. He said: We cannot wait for nature to give us things, we must seize things from it. This is the conclusion of his more than sixty years of hard work, and it is also the essence of the entire Michurin doctrine.

    Michurin's success also lies in his meticulous and detailed working style. From countless meticulous observations, he discovered many variations of fruit trees, thus breeding many new varieties; from countless experiments, he cultivated southern fruit trees in the north, making them blossom and bear fruit as they do in the south. This is completely different from conservative and dogmatic scientists who only pay attention to "significant" variations and let many things they consider insignificant slip away, and the people in the cold regions are destined not to eat fruit.

    From here, it is not difficult to determine our way of thinking and find our way of working. Our disease-resistant breeding work should not be limited to inoculation in greenhouses or experimental fields, but more importantly, go to the disease-prone areas to collect crops that are not infected or lightly infected for research. From the natural living conditions, find new disease-resistant seeds.

    Zhang Lifan in Suiyuan planted winter wheat from Mount Wutai in the cold Suiyuan, and he can also find the way for it to grow in Suiyuan from the cultivation method. The seed selection and seed change that are generally carried out by farmers in the countryside, as well as the "two openings to one cooling" warm soup soaking method popular in the old liberated areas, are all good experiences among the masses. Michurin scientifically summarized these excellent experiences of the masses. Michurin's method is also the method of the mass line, which is to find experience from the broad masses, summarize experience, and improve experience; it is a method to find new things from the natural world and discover new things.

    From this, it is not difficult for us to determine that our future work in agricultural science must accept the new mass viewpoint and abandon the old viewpoint; it must be a policy of going to the masses and going to the natural world, and not just a policy of greenhouses, laboratories, and libraries. The most important thing in our research on animal husbandry and crops is to design and promote the mass selection of seeds and the preservation of seed livestock. Horticulture should study the problem of spring vegetables in disaster areas and vegetable cultivation in saline-alkali land. Forestry should design and promote the research of sand-prevention and windbreak forests and protective forests for state-owned farms. Soil should focus on the utilization and improvement of saline-alkali land. Fertilizers should study the use and preservation methods of rural fertilizers. Animal diseases and crop pests should be fully studied for mass prevention. Applied botany should focus on the research and introduction of Michurin's method. All of this should be the basic work of studying the Michurin direction.

    Michurin has opened up infinitely broad prospects for biology and for human happiness. The construction of our new country and the lives of our people require us to quickly abandon the old theories and old working methods and move into the new Michurin direction.

    The research on Michurin's theory is only just beginning in China. We must truly verify it from practical work and from the broad masses, steadily transplant Michurin's achievements to the land of the new China, and bury the outdated and reactionary things of Weismann, Morgan, and Mendel in the tomb of history. This is the glorious and great task of Chinese agricultural scientists.

    中国科学工作者如何向米丘林学习
    陈凤桐
    米丘林是一位科学家，也是一位辩证唯物主义者。他用自己的辛勤的劳作，从无数次失败中找经验；用实际经验，驳斥了唯心的、认为世界上的事物是不变的，因而也就没法发展的魏斯曼、莫尔根和孟德尔的反动理论，并用铁的事实把他们打得粉碎。他又吸取了和发展了达尔文的进化学说，使它为人类的实际生活服务，为全世界生物学家，特别是农业科学工作者开辟了一条唯一应遵循的道路。米丘林的伟大功绩就在这里，他所以为列宁和斯大林所重视也在这里。
    米丘林之所以伟大，又在于他热爱祖国，热爱祖国的人民，他曾经坚决拒绝了美国帝国主义者和美国资产阶级学者们想把他和他的果园搬到美国去。米丘林在沙皇时代所遭受的艰苦坎坷生活中，也没中断过他的研究工作。
    米丘林之所以成功，在于他不说空话，而是老老实实面向实际，从不厌千百遍的实验中找真理，找自然界的规律，并掌握这一规律。他说：我们不能等待大自然赐给我们东西，我们要向他夺取东西。这是他六十多年辛勤劳苦的结论，也是全部米丘林学说的精髓。
    米丘林之所以成功，又在于他的缜密细致的工作作风，他从无数次的缜密观察中，去发现果树的许多变种，因而育成许多新的品种；从无数次的实验中，把南方的果树栽培到北方，使它同在南方一样开花结果；这和保守主义者及教条主义者的科学家，只注意变异的“显著”，而把许多他们认为不显著的东西，都从眼底滑走，和寒带的人民就命定的吃不上水果，是完全不同的。
    从这里不难确定我们的思想方法，和找到我们的工作方式。我们的抗病育种工作不应只限于温室里或实验地里的接菌，更重要的是到发病地区去采取不感染或感染轻的作物，进行研究。从自然的生活条件中，去发现新的抗病种子。
    绥远张立范把五台山冬小麦播种在寒冷的绥远，从栽培法上也能找出它在绥远生长的途径。乡村中农民普遍进行着的选种和换种以及老解放区风行的“二开兑一凉”的温汤浸种，都是群众中很好的经验。米丘林科学地总结了这些群众的优良经验。米丘林的方法也就是群众路线的方法，是从广大群众中去找经验，总结经验，提高经验；是从大自然界里去找寻新的东西，发现新的东西的方法。
    由此我们不难确定，我们今后对于农业科学的工作，必须接受新的群众的观点，抛弃那一套旧的观点；必须是走到群众中去，走到大自然界中去的方针，而不仅是温室、实验室、图书室的方针。我们的畜牧和作物的研究，最重要的是设计和推动群众的选种和种子种畜的保存，园艺应研究灾区春菜和盐碱地种菜问题，森林应设计和推广防沙防风林和国营农场护地林的研究，土壤应着重盐碱地的利用和改进，肥料应研究乡村肥料的使用和保存方法，兽疫和作物病虫害应全力研究群众性预防，应用植物学应着重米丘林方法的研究和介绍，这一切都应是研究米丘林方向的起码工作。
    米丘林为生物学，为人类幸福开辟了无限宽阔的前途。我们新国家的建设，我们的人民生活，要求我们迅速抛弃旧的理论和旧的工作方法，走入新的米丘林的方向来。
    米丘林理论的研究，在中国还只是在开始，我们必须切切实实从实际工作中去证实，从广大群众中去证实，把米丘林的成果稳步的移植到新中国的大地上来，把魏斯曼、莫尔根和孟德尔的陈旧的反动的东西埋葬到历史的坟墓中去。这是中国农业科学工作者的光荣伟大任务。
