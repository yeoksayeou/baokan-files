Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 14th: To cooperate with the national industrial recovery and development, the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government has formulated the guiding principles and plans for national coal mine production in 1950, as well as the tasks for coal mine work, and has put forward specific requirements for various regions. In 1950, national coal mines will undergo comprehensive restoration and partial construction, and increase production efficiency by 20% to 30%. In order to formulate the above-mentioned guiding principles, plans, and tasks, the Ministry of Fuel Industry convened a national coal mine conference in Beijing from November 17th to 30th last year, and passed a resolution. The main cadres and engineering technical personnel of the Northeast, North China, Shandong Coal Mine Administration, and major coal mines such as Fushun, Huainan, and Zichuan attended the conference.

According to the resolution of the National Coal Industry Conference, the guiding principle for the production of national state-owned coal mines in 1950 is to focus on comprehensive restoration, with Northeast China as the key for partial construction. The resolution pointed out that under the correct leadership of the People's Government and the active efforts of the workers, the mines in Northeast, North China, and East China have recovered 74%. However, in the past, due to the predatory mining by foreign imperialists, most of China's coal mines were temporary small inclined shafts. Before 1952, 55 mines will be abandoned due to the depletion of coal reserves. This reduction in the number of coal mines will not be able to meet the needs of industrial development in the coming years. This situation is even more serious in the Northeast. Therefore, in addition to vigorously producing and restoring, national coal mine work must also build several new mines.

According to the above-mentioned guiding principles and the specific conditions of various regions, the conference resolved that in addition to planning to restore 29 mines in the Northeast, 11 new vertical shafts, 2 open-pit mines, and 4 inclined shafts should be newly built from 1950 to 1952, to ensure the highest amount of coal needed by Northeast China's industry in 1952. Because there are fewer mines in North China that have been depleted and abandoned, and more mines need to be restored, the focus should be on restoration, and 7 mines should be restored in 1950. East China should also focus on restoration, and 6 mines should be restored in 1950. In addition, 3 new vertical shafts should be built to achieve self-sufficiency in coal use in East China in 1952, and gradually reduce the huge transportation burden caused by the transportation of coal from the north to the south. Coal mines in Central China, Northwest China, and Southwest China should improve equipment and increase output in 1950 to supply local coal use.

		Improve Technology, Increase Efficiency, Improve Quality, and Reduce Costs

The main tasks of national coal mine work in 1950 are to improve technology, increase production efficiency, improve quality, and reduce costs. The resolution pointed out that technological improvement should be combined with uniting the broad masses of workers and giving full play to their enthusiasm and creativity, and should learn from the advanced technology of the Soviet Union. In 1950, the general production efficiency of state-owned coal mines across the country should be increased by 20% to 30%. The maximum ash content of coal sold domestically should not exceed 20%. The cost of coal production should be reduced by 8% to 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 1949.

		Establish and Improve Safety Facilities and Establish the Idea of ​​Safety First

The conference also made specific provisions on strengthening safety work. The conference resolved that each mining area should quickly establish and improve safety organizations, increase safety equipment, improve safety facilities, train safety cadres, and carry out safety education among workers, and establish the idea of ​​safety first. In the future, general mines should strive to have sufficient air volume of 3 cubic meters per person per minute, and the temperature should not be higher than 25 degrees Celsius. When the gas in the workplace reaches 1.5%, work should be stopped immediately, and measures should be taken quickly to solve the problem to prevent fire.

		Appropriately Allocate Technical Staff and Pay Attention to Training Mining Cadres

The conference decided that in the future, there will be an extreme shortage of technical personnel in restoring old mines, building new mines, improving technology, and using new equipment. It was resolved to plan and appropriately concentrate engineering technical personnel and workers for the construction of new mines, and under the direct leadership of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, help various regions, especially the Northeast, to build new mines. In order to improve the technical level of existing technical personnel and train a large number of new technical cadres, it was decided that each coal mine administration should establish mining colleges, and the Ministry of Fuel Industry should establish a mining institute, and request the Central People's Government to expand the enrollment quota of mining departments in various universities. In terms of education methods, emphasis should be placed on the combination of theory and practice, and the curriculum should focus on depth, not breadth, to shorten the learning time.

In addition, the conference also made decisions on how to strengthen the economic accounting system, carry out the conservation movement, how to give full play to the effectiveness of existing equipment, manufacture mining machinery, and how to improve the treatment of workers.

    配合全国工业的恢复发展
    燃料工业部制定今年生产计划
    全面恢复煤矿生产
    提高生产率百分之二十至三十
    东北各地并集中力量建设新矿
    【新华社北京十四日电】为了配合全国工业的恢复和发展，中央人民政府燃料工业部已拟定一九五○年全国煤矿生产的方针和计划及煤矿工作的任务，并对各地区提出了具体要求。在一九五○年，全国煤矿将进行全面恢复和部分建设，并提高生产效率百分之二十至三十。为了拟定上述方针、计划和任务，燃料工业部曾在去年十一月十七日至三十日在京召开了全国煤矿会议，并通过了决议。出席该次会议的有东北、华北、山东煤矿管理局及抚顺、淮南、淄川等主要煤矿的主要干部及工程技术人员。
    根据全国煤业会议的决议，一九五○年全国国营煤矿生产的方针，是以全面恢复为主，部分建设则以东北为重点。决议指出，在人民政府的正确领导和职工的积极努力下，东北、华北、华东等地矿井已恢复了百分之七十四。但过去我国煤矿由于外国帝国主义的掠夺性的开采，多数是临时性的小斜井，一九五二年以前，即将有五十五个矿井因贮煤采完而告废弃。这种煤矿数量的减少势将不能满足几年以后工业发展的需要。在东北，这种情况更为严重。因此全国煤矿工作除大力生产和恢复外，还须建设若干新矿井。
    根据上述方针和各地具地情况，会议决议，东北除计划恢复二十九个矿井外，从一九五○年至一九五二年还应以建设为主，要新建十一个新式立井，两个露天矿及四个斜井，保证一九五二年东北工业需煤的最高数量。华北因煤矿采完作废的矿井较少，须恢复生产的矿井较多，因此以恢复为主，一九五○年要恢复七个矿井。华东亦以恢复为主，一九五○年要恢复六个矿井。此外，要建设三个新式立井，以便做到一九五二年华东区用煤自给自足，逐渐减少北煤南运所造成的巨大运输力的负担。华中、西北、西南等地煤矿在一九五○年则应改善设备，提高产量，以供给地方用煤。
            改进技术提高效率提高质量减低成本
    一九五○年全国煤矿工作任务，主要为改进技术，提高生产效率，提高质量与减低成本。决议指出改进技术要与团结广大职工群众和发挥他们的积极性、创造性相结合，应学习苏联的进步技术。一九五○年全国各国营煤矿一般应提高生产效率百分之二十到三十。内销煤含灰分最高不得超过百分之二十。产煤成本比一九四九年第四季要减低百分之八到十五。
            建立健全保安设施树立安全第一思想
    会议对加强保安工作的问题也作了具体规定。会议决议各矿区应迅速建立与健全保安组织，增加安全设备，改进保安设施，培养保安干部，并在职工中间展开保安教育，树立安全第一的思想。今后一般矿井应力求每分钟每人有三立方公尺的充足风量，温度不得高于摄氏二十五度。工作场中的沼气达到百分之一·五时应立即停止工作，并迅速设法解决，以防火险。
            适当调配技术员工注意培养矿业干部
    会议以今后在恢复旧矿井，建设新矿井，改进技术，使用新式设备等方面技术人材异常缺乏，决议有计划地适当集中建设新矿井的工程技术人员和工人，在燃料工业部的直接领导下帮助各地，首先是东北建设新井。为提高现有技术人员的技术水平与培养大批新的技术干部，决定各煤矿管理局应建立矿业专科学校，燃料工业部设立矿业学院，并请求中央人民政府扩充各大学采矿系的招生名额。在教育方法上应着重理论与实际之结合，课程应注重精深，不宜过于广博，以缩短学习时间。
    此外，会议对如何加强经济核算制度开展节约运动；如何发挥现有设备的效能，制造矿山机械；如何改善职工待遇等问题，也分别有所决定。
