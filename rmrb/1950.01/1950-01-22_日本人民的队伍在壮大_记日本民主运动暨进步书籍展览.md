The Ranks of the Japanese People are Growing
    ——A Record of the Japanese Democratic Movement and Progressive Book Exhibition
    Bosheng
    Today, the Japanese people are in a difficult and arduous environment. Japanese fascism and militarism, under the direct command of U.S. imperialism, are frantically attacking democratic forces and the people's lives. Therefore, the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism and its Japanese lackeys is becoming more resolute and intense. After seeing the exhibition on the Japanese Democratic Movement and Progressive Books, organized by the Cultural Liaison Bureau of the Ministry of Culture and held in Zhongshan Park, people will gain a vivid and clear understanding of the arduous struggle currently waged by the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries.
    This exhibition is divided into two parts: photographs and books and magazines. The photographs are divided into ten series, with more than eighty frames, and the books and magazines number over two hundred types, with over four hundred volumes. In those photographs depicting the lives of the Japanese people, we see how, under the reactionary Yoshida Cabinet supported by U.S. imperialism, the people are suffering political oppression, cultural corruption and poisoning, and their lives are becoming increasingly impoverished. There is a photograph showing a group of innocent children gathered around their dismissed teacher, offering condolences, because the teacher was forcibly dismissed by the authorities as a "progressive thinker"! Another photograph reflects that there are one million homeless laborers in Japan, miserably huddled in damp air-raid shelters and dilapidated boiler flues! The vast majority of hardworking Japanese farmers, after their daily toil, can only get a bowl of corn gruel and sweet potato rice that is not enough to fill their stomachs! A Japanese woman, hired by capitalists to do mobile advertising, carried an advertising board on her back and knelt on the street, kneeling all day, earning only 56 Japanese yen. But a bowl of noodles costs 100 yen! Many unemployed people queued up at the entrance of the Ueno district job center in Tokyo. They waited all night, without even eating, hoping to find a job to make a living, but were still met with disappointment! Small civil servants whose monthly salary could only buy 63 kilograms of rice, because they could not support their families and maintain their livelihoods, also carried wooden boards to parade in the streets, writing on the boards: "A monthly salary of 6,300 yen is equivalent to suicide"...! Under such circumstances, it is inevitable that the Japanese people, led by the Japanese working class, will rise up to resist the reactionary rule!
    On May 30, 1949, the Japanese reactionaries brutally murdered Hashimoto Kinzaburo, a national railway worker, for opposing the "New Public Safety Ordinance" (anti-strike law). Hashimoto was kicked down from the third floor of a Tokyo restaurant by brutal policemen. Because he was not completely killed by the fall, these policemen surrounded him and beat him to death. Regarding this bloody case, the Japanese Communist Party demanded that the murderers be punished, but was instead falsely accused by the reactionaries of saying, "If the Communist Party did not oppose the anti-strike law, Hashimoto Kinzaburo would not have died." But all the conspiracies of the reactionaries were exposed by countless mass protest rallies! It was the reactionaries who killed Hashimoto! The purpose of killing Hashimoto was to suppress Japanese workers!
    It is clear from the photographs that in order to protect the private wealth of U.S. and Japanese capitalists, the reactionary Yoshida Cabinet, supported by U.S. imperialism, under the guise of "saving capital" and "eliminating deficits," forcibly issued an order for mass layoffs in July 1949. In the national railway sector alone, 200,000 people were laid off. The workers of the national railway launched a large-scale strike to oppose the unjustified dismissal. Subsequently, more and more Japanese workers opposed unemployment and oppression. In order to protest against the oppression of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, they held a demonstration rally, with large slogans reading: "We want work, not massacre."
    This series of Japanese workers' strike movements is not only an economic struggle, but has in fact entered a nationwide and widespread political struggle. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are doing everything in their power to undermine the magnificent workers' movement. The Japanese reactionaries fabricated the "Three-Carriage Train Derailment Incident" in Tokyo, arrested six Communist Party members, and used torture to force them to confess, but the conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries went bankrupt shamefully, because the "reasons" they held were refuted by the facts!
    On May 1, 1949, Labor Day, hundreds of thousands of Japanese laborers held demonstrations and parades. Although under the supervision of U.S. military police and Japanese secret police, the marching队伍队伍 (duìwǔ队伍 - ranks) was still so strong and brave. Under the influence of the heroic revolutionary struggle of the Japanese workers, the ranks of the peasants have also grown. In order to demand a reasonable tax reform movement, tens of thousands of peasant petitioners are also marching proudly on the asphalt roads of Tokyo. Today, the Japanese working women are not willing to lag behind, and they also bravely participate in the ranks of the struggle.

            Japanese Progressive People Cheer for New China
    When the news of the founding of the People's Republic of China reached Japan, the overseas Chinese in Tokyo were filled with joy and happiness, and the five-star red flag was immediately planted in Tokyo in October! They received countless congratulations from Japanese friends! The Japanese Communist Party solemnly held a celebration meeting to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China, shouting "Long live the Communist Party of China and its leader Mao Zedong!" "Long live the unity of the Chinese and Japanese people!" The birth of New China brought them such great joy, because the victory of the Chinese people's revolution gave the Japanese people enormous encouragement. The victory of the Chinese people is also the victory of the Japanese people!
    In a few photos of the Japanese cultural circles commemorating Lu Xun, the great revolutionary writer of China, we also see how Lu Xun is admired by the Japanese people! On the anniversary of Lu Xun's death, the Japanese cultural circles also held an exhibition of Chinese woodcuts. The photos of the Japan's Pukeei Theater performing "The True Story of Ah Q" are even more exciting.
    In the exhibition, there are more than two hundred kinds and more than four hundred copies of progressive books and magazines, divided into nine categories: politics and economics, social issues, science and technology and Chinese issues, literature and art, and magazines. Among them, what attracts people's attention most is the Japanese people's ardent love for Chairman Mao's works and their infinite concern for the Chinese people's revolution. The Japanese translation of Chairman Mao's works such as "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship", "On the Coalition Government" and "On New Democracy" are selling quickly in Japan. Books on Chinese studies include "The New Democratic Revolution in China" and "China Information Monthly".
    The books and magazines published by various progressive people's organizations in Japan include "Laborer's Literature" published by the New Japanese Literature Association, "Industrial Labor Monthly" published by the Japan Labor and Agriculture News Agency, and "Truth" published by the People's Publishing House, all of which are new books loved by the Japanese people. From the publication and distribution of these books and magazines, we can also tell how the Japanese people today are accepting progressive political and cultural theories to arm their revolutionary ideas and embark on the road of fighting forward.

    日本人民的队伍在壮大
    ——记日本民主运动暨进步书籍展览
    柏生
    今天，日本人民正处在艰苦困难的环境下，日本法西斯的军国主义，在美帝国主义直接指挥下疯狂的向民主势力进攻，向人民生活进攻，因此日本人民向美帝及其日本走卒进行的革命斗争，也来得更坚决更强烈。看了文化部对外文化事务联络局在中山公园展出的关于日本民主运动暨进步书籍展览后，人们会对目前日本人民向美帝及日本反动派进行的艰巨斗争得到一个生动的形象的认识。
    这个展览共分照片与书籍杂志两部分，照片分为十辑，共有八十余帧，书籍杂志有二百余种，四百余册。在那些描绘着日本人民生活的照片上，我们看到在美帝扶植下的反动吉田内阁统治下，人民是怎样在政治上遭受压迫、在文化上受着腐蚀和毒害，生活日渐走向贫困。有这样一张照片：一群天真的儿童围聚在他们被辞退的教员身旁慰问着，因为老师“进步思想分子”而为官方强迫解聘！另一张照片反映，日本有一百万户无家可归的劳动人民，凄惨地蜷伏在阴湿的防空洞里和破旧黑洞的锅炉筒里！广大的日本劳苦的农民们，每天辛苦的劳动着，换来的也只是吃不饱的一碗玉米糊涂粥和白薯饭！一个被资本家雇去做活动广告的日本女子，背上背着广告牌在街上跪着、跪了一天，不过赚到日币五十六块钱。而一碗面条就要一百元！许多失业的人民，排队挤在东京上野区职业介绍所的门口。他们为了等待着找到一个糊口的职业，等了一夜，连饭没有吃，然而带给他们的仍旧是失望！一个月薪水只能买六十三斤米的小公务员们，因为不能养家，不能维持生活，也背着木板去街上游行，他们在木板上写着：“等于自杀的六千三百元月棒”……！以日本工人阶级为领导的日本人民，在这样情形下，起而反抗反动统治是必然的！
    一九四九年五月三十日，日本反动派惨杀了为反对《新公安条例》（禁止罢工法）的一个国有铁道工人桥本金三郎。在东京餐厅的三楼上，桥本被凶暴的警察们一脚踢下楼来。因为没有完全跌死，这些警察们便又围上去把他活活地打死。为了这件血案，日本共产党要求惩办杀人犯，但却被反动派反诬为“如果共产党不反对禁止罢工法，桥本金三郎是不会死的。”但反动派的一切阴谋，都被无数群众的抗议大会所揭穿了！杀死桥本的是反动派！杀死桥本是为了镇压日本工人！
    从照片上明显地看到：在美帝扶植下的反动吉田内阁，为了保护美日资本家的私肥，以“储蓄资本”“消灭赤字”为美名，在一九四九年七月，强行大裁员的命令，只国有铁道一个部门被裁人员就有二十万人，国有铁道的工人们为了反对无理解雇，展开了大罢工。接着，反对失业压迫的日本工人愈来愈多了。他们为了抗议美日反动派的压迫，召开了示威大会，大幅标语上写着：“我们要工作，不要虐杀”。
    这一连串的日本工人的罢工运动，不仅仅是经济的斗争，事实上已进入全国性的广泛的政治斗争。美日反动派对于壮阔的工人运动是竭其全力来破坏的。日本反动派制造了东京“三携车站翻车事件”，逮捕了六个共产党员，用非刑强迫他们招供，但美日反动派的阴谋可耻地破产了，因为他们所持的“理由”为事实驳倒了！
    一九四九年“五一”劳动节，日本数十万的劳动人民举行了示威大游行，虽然在美帝宪兵和日本特务警察的监视下，游行的队伍仍旧是那么坚强勇敢。在日本工人英勇的革命的斗争影响下，农民的队伍也壮大起来了，为了要求合理的改税运动，成千成万的农民请愿队伍也昂然地走在东京的柏油马路上。今天，日本的劳动妇女们，也不甘落后，她们也英勇地参加到斗争的队伍中来。
            日本进步人民为新中国欢呼
    当中华人民共和国成立的消息传到日本时，东京的华侨充满欢欣和愉快，五星红旗立刻被他们插到十月的东京！他们接受了无数日本友人的祝贺！日本共产党为了庆祝中华人民共和国的成立，隆重地举行庆祝大会，他们高呼着“中国共产党及其领导者毛泽东万岁！”“中日人民的团结万岁！”中国的新生带给了他们这样大的喜悦，这是因为中国人民革命的胜利，给日本人民以莫大的鼓舞，中国人民的胜利，也是日本人民的胜利！
    在日本文化界纪念中国伟大革命文豪鲁迅的几帧照片中，我们也同样地看到鲁迅是怎样地受着日本人民的景仰！在鲁迅祭日，日本文化界并举行中国木刻展览。日本的仆吉剧团上演《阿Ｑ正传》的照片，更使人觉得兴奋。
    在展览中有二百余种、四百余册进步书籍杂志，分为政治经济、社会问题、科学技术与中国问题、文艺、杂志等九大类。其中最引起人们注意的，是日本人民对于毛主席的著作的热烈的喜爱，和对中国人民革命的无限的关心。日译本的毛主席著作《论人民民主专政》、《论联合政府》、《新民主主义论》等，在日本都销的很快。关于研究中国问题的书籍，有《中国的新民主主义革命》《中国资料月报》等。
    日本各进步人民团体出版的书籍杂志，有新日本文学会出版的《劳动者文学》，日本劳农通信社出版的《产业劳动月报》，人民社出版的《真相》等，都是日本人民所爱戴的新书籍。从这些书籍杂志的出版与发行，也可以告诉我们，今天的日本人民是怎样的在接受着进步的政治文化理论，来武装他们的革命思想，而走向战斗前进的道路上。（完）
