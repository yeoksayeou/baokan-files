    Guaranteeing Shanghai's Supply of Raw Materials and Food for the People
    Large Quantities of Cotton and Grain Are Shipped to Shanghai
    170,000 Dan of Raw Cotton Shipped to Shanghai in Half a Month; Northeast Rice Is Being Shipped South in Batches

    [This newspaper Shanghai News] Since the beginning of the year, grain and cotton from North China, Northeast China, Northwest China, and Central China have been continuously shipped to Shanghai to supply the cotton textile industry and the people's food needs. In the first half of this month alone, more than 170,000 dan of cotton were shipped to Shanghai from North China, Northwest China, and Central China, with an average of more than 10,000 dan of cotton arriving in Shanghai every day, setting a new historical record. This batch of cotton is uniformly controlled by the Shanghai Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company to meet the production needs of the cotton textile industry. In order to take care of the production of private yarn factories, the company started the fourth emergency allocation of cotton on the 16th, with a quantity of 30,000 dan, and decided on the cotton-to-yarn ratio. Those who can pay off the cotton yarn within five days after signing the contract can exchange 555 jin of cotton for one piece of Grade A yarn. Those who pay off the cotton yarn in two installments within two weeks after signing the contract can exchange 550 jin of cotton for one piece of Grade A yarn. The cotton yarn is based on 20-count Jincheng yarn. The company will sign contracts with various factories according to the specific circumstances. On the 16th, it first signed contracts with Daan, Xinsheng, and Hengtong factories. In addition, in order to take care of the capital turnover and product sales of private yarn factories, the company will sign supply and sales contracts with them. For example, on the 16th, it agreed with Hexing Yarn Factory to sell 30 pieces of 20-count Lotus yarn for the factory every week.

    Also: In order to ensure the supply of food for the people of Shanghai, following the 20,000 tons of rice from the Northeast to support Shanghai last fall, the second large batch of rice is being shipped to Shanghai in batches. The first batch of 450 tons arrived the week before. Furthermore, at the beginning of this month, the Anhui North Trade Corporation also transferred a large number of food rice and local products to Shanghai from various places, including nearly 5 million jin of brown rice from Chaohu, Hefei, Chuxian, and other places, as well as more than one million jin of wheat from Suxian and other places, and a large number of soybeans, rice, hemp, peanuts, and Anqing cotton, vegetable oil, sesame oil, peanut oil, charcoal, etc. The above materials are all handed over to various professional companies for unified control and supply. Thanks to the strong supply from various places, the prices in the Shanghai market have gradually stabilized.
