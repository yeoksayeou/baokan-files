    Strive to Promote the Development of Health and Medical Undertakings
    Gao Shiqi
            (1) Epidemic Prevention
    The Chinese People's Revolutionary War is about to achieve complete victory throughout the country, but on another battlefield, the battle is raging fiercely, and the remaining forces of infectious diseases headed by cholera remain to be eliminated. Now that the gunfire is about to stop, what lies before us is the serious problem of epidemic prevention in all directions. We should show the same determination and courage to strengthen the epidemic situation work of infectious diseases, earnestly handle the registration and statistics of deaths from epidemic diseases, strengthen environmental sanitation projects, establish various specialized committees for the control of infectious diseases, organize epidemic prevention teams and propaganda teams, and set up quarantine stations and isolation hospitals at transportation hubs. These are the central tasks of epidemic prevention. The new China urgently needs to promote and develop health and medical undertakings, which has been stipulated in Article 48 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This is the necessary path to complete the New Democratic Revolution.
            (2) Medical Treatment
    Chinese poets once sang "The body is the worker's capital." The body is like a machine, and if it breaks down, it needs to be repaired. The factory for repairing the body is the hospital, and the workers who repair the body are doctors and nurses. In our environment, countless enemies that destroy the body lurk in the darkness. Our body, this machine, is always in danger of being damaged. Our country has 475 million people, but under the current conditions, the ratio of doctors to the population is too far apart. In terms of medical treatment, our current task should be large-scale production of medicines and equipment, large-scale training of medical cadres, and planned and step-by-step development of medical education and medical research (including research on traditional Chinese medicine and improvement of traditional Chinese medicine) that meets actual needs. This medical education plan must be coordinated with the study of New Democratic politics so that medicine can truly serve the people and doctors can become people's doctors, and nurses can become people's nurses. This is a great and arduous project. We must gradually improve in the new situation and on the existing basis, and then we will have sufficient manpower and material resources to universally establish regular hospitals, sanatoriums, clinics, first-aid stations, and midwifery stations, so that the medical team can penetrate into every factory, every school, every rural area, and every army unit, and station in the backward inland and remote border areas.
            (3) Healthcare
    Most of the Chinese people, especially the working class and the peasantry, have been subjected to the heavy exploitation and oppression of feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in the past, living an inhuman and difficult material life, and could not enjoy any of the benefits of modern science (including medicine), not even the basic scientific knowledge of the environment and the body. Now things are different. In terms of healthcare, our new country must pay close attention to the health of the people, especially the health of women, infants and children, in terms of nutrition, housing, environmental sanitation, entertainment, social insurance, working conditions and mental hygiene, and must implement universal health education to give the people the weapon of health knowledge to improve the health level of the people so that every person has a sound physique and a healthy life to bear the heavy responsibility of production and construction.
            (4) Relief
    Finally, in terms of relief work, we must take care of the honorary soldiers who have contributed to the liberation of the people, as well as the old, weak, disabled, reduce their work, and give them appropriate vocational education; we must take care of the long-term patients, give them reasonable recuperation, and improve their living environment; we must take care of those who encounter unexpected disasters and give them timely relief and assistance.
    Epidemic prevention, medical treatment, healthcare, and relief are the four main contents of the health cause of the People's Republic of China. We should wholeheartedly implement the task of Article 48 of the Common Program, learn from the 30 years of experience of the Soviet Union, and strive to promote the development of health and medical undertakings to complete the revolutionary task of the new China's health work.

    努力推广卫生医药事业
    高士其
            （一）防疫
    中国人民革命战争就要在全国范围内得到完全胜利了，但在另外一个战场上，战斗正在猛烈进行中，以霍乱为首的传染病的残余势力尚待扫灭。现在炮声快要停止，而摆在我们面前的正是四方八面的严重的防疫问题。我们应当拿出同样的决心与勇气去加强流行病的疫情工作，切实办理疫病死亡的登记与统计，加强环境卫生的工事，设立各种传染病专门管制委员会，组织防疫队，宣传队，在交通的枢纽上设置检疫所和隔离病院等，这些都是防疫的中心工作。新中国迫切地需要推广与发展卫生医药事业，这在人民政协共同纲领的第四十八条上已经有规定。这是完成新民主主义革命所必经的道路。
            （二）医疗
    中国的诗人曾经歌唱过“身体就是工人的本钱”。身体像机器，坏了就需要修理，修理身体的工厂是医院，修理身体的工人是医师和护士。在我们的环境里面，有无数破坏身体的敌人在黑暗里潜伏着。我们的身体，这架机器，随时都有损坏的危险。我们全国有四万万七千五百万人口，可是在目前的条件下，医师人数和人口的比例相差得太远。在医疗方面，我们当前的任务应当是大规模的生产药品器材，大量的培养医药干部，有计划有步骤地发展合乎实际需要的医学教育和医学研究（包括研究中药，提高中医）。这个医学教育的计划，必须配合新民主主义政治的学习，使医学能够达到真正为人民服务的目的，使医师成为人民医师，护士成为人民护士。这是一个伟大而艰巨的工程，我们必须在新情况下，在现有的基础上，逐步改进，然后我们才能有足够的人力物力去普遍的设立正规的医院、疗养院、诊疗所、急救站、接生站等，使医学的队伍能够深入到每一个工厂，每一个学校，每一个农村，每一个部队里去，进驻到落后的内地和遥远的边疆。
            （三）保健
    大多数的中国人民，尤其是工人阶级和农民阶级，过去受着封建主义、帝国主义、官僚资本主义的重重剥削和层层压迫，过着那非人的困苦的物质生活，现代科学的福利（包括医学），一点也享受不到，就连对于环境，对于身体的起码的科学知识都得不到。现在不同了。在保健方面，我们的新国家，对于人民的健康，尤其是对于妇婴儿童的健康，在营养、居住、环境卫生、娱乐、社会保险、工作情况和心理卫生等各方面都要加以密切的注视，而且要实施普遍的卫生教育，把卫生知识的武器交给人民，以提高人民的健康水平，使每一个人民都有健全的体格和健康的生活，来负担起生产建设的重任。
            （四）救济
    最后，在救济事业方面，必须照顾到有功于人民解放的荣誉军人，以及老弱残废，减轻他们的工作，给他们以适当的职业教育；要照顾到长期病者，给他们以合理的疗养，改良他们的生活环境；要照顾到遭遇意外的灾难者，给他们以及时的救济和帮助。
    防疫、医疗、保健和救济是中华人民共和国卫生事业的四项主要内容，我们应当全心全意的执行共同纲领第四十八条的任务，吸取苏联三十余年的经验，去努力推广卫生医药事业，以完成新中国卫生工作的革命任务。
