    State-Run Jingu District Farm
    Increased Rice Production by 50 Million Jin Last Year
    Main Reasons for Success: Abolishing Feudal Exploitative Organizations and Vigorously Restoring Water Conservancy Projects.
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Jingu District State-Run Reclamation Bureau, the largest rice-producing state-run farm in North China, held its annual work summary meeting in Tianjin. After several days of enthusiastic discussion by its sixteen subordinate units, Director Wang Xintian of the bureau delivered a work summary speech on December 26th of last year regarding the year 1949. He first pointed out that during the period of Japanese puppet rule, the Jingu District farms possessed over 340,000 mu of land and complete electrified water conservancy equipment. After Japan's surrender, the central government and local authorities of the Kuomintang fought for power and profit, dividing it into the Hebei Reclamation Farm and the Hebei Provincial Farmland Bureau. This resulted in the destruction of the vast electrified water conservancy equipment of the farms, with the exception of the Junliangcheng and Zhangguizhuang farms, which were spared. The Gaoli Farm was particularly badly damaged. After the takeover, under the correct leadership of the Military Control Commission, the nine units of similar nature were merged into the Reclamation Bureau, and overcoming all difficulties, in addition to taking over 160,000 mu of land, another 100,000 mu of cultivated land were expanded. This brought the total output of the district to over 54 million jin of rice. The more than 15 million jin of rice distributed to the peasants as dividends has been transported to Tianjin and put into storage, completing the production task of increasing the yield of each mu by five sheng of coarse grains. Thanks to the efforts of all staff and cadres, the correct leadership of the higher-level Party, and the enthusiastic support of the broad masses, the output of the Jingu District has generally increased. Taking the Xiaozhan Farm as an example, this year the average yield of rice per mu was 531 jin, an increase of 20 percent compared to the 425 jin per mu during the Kuomintang period, and an increase of 49 percent compared to the 348 jin per mu during the Japanese puppet period. Therefore, the Reclamation Bureau has laid a favorable foundation for the future restoration and development of the reclamation enterprise.
    Director Wang then explained that the successful completion of the task was due to: (1) Abolishing feudal exploitative organizations. A total of 23,000 mu of land belonging to 140 "second landlords" in Xiaozhan were distributed to over 1,400 landless poor peasants and farm laborers; over 24,000 mu of land belonging to 87 "second landlords" in Junliangcheng and Zhangguizhuang were distributed to landless poor peasants and farm laborers. (2) Vigorously restoring and developing water conservancy projects, expanding the cultivated land area, and providing agricultural loans. (3) Improving farming techniques, implementing intensive cultivation, strengthening business management, and gradually achieving enterprise-based management and democratic management. Finally, he encouraged all staff and cadres to study hard, overcome shortcomings, and strive to complete the 1950 production plan of restoring and expanding 130,000 mu of cultivated land and increasing rice production by 100 million jin.

    国营津沽区农场
    去年增产稻谷五千万斤
    取得成绩的主要原因：取消封建剥削组织，大力恢复水利工程。
    【本报讯】华北最大稻作国营农场—津沽区农垦管理局在津召开全年工作总结会议，经过所属十六单位连日热烈讨论，于去年十二月二十六日由该局王心田局长作一九四九年工作总结发言。他首先指出：津沽区各农场在日伪时期拥有土地三十四万余亩和完整的电化水利设备。日本投降后国民党中央与地方争权夺利互不相让，遂瓜分为河北垦业农场，河北省农田局。致使各农场庞大的电化水利设备除军粮城、张贵庄两农场外，全遭破坏。尤其以高里农场为甚。接管后，在军管会正确的领导下，将性质相同的九个单位合并成农垦局，并排除一切困难，除接收十六万亩地外又扩大耕地面积十万亩。使全区总产量超过五千四百余万斤稻谷，与农民分红所得的一千五百余万斤稻谷已运津入库，全部完成了每亩增产五升粗粮的生产任务。由于全体职工干部的努力和上级党的正确领导以及广大群众的热烈支持，使津沽区的产量普遍提高。以小站农场为例，今年每亩平均稻谷五百三十一斤，比国民党时期每亩四百二十五斤增产百分之二十；比日伪时期每亩三百四十八斤增产百分之四十九。因此使农垦局在今后恢复与发展农垦事业上打下了有利的基础。
    王局长继又说明胜利地完成任务是由于：（一）取消封建剥削组织。计将小站一百四十户“二地主”两万三千亩土地分配给一千四百余户无地的贫雇农；军粮城、张贵庄八十七户“二地主”两万四千余亩的土地分配给无地的贫雇农。（二）大力恢复与发展水利工程扩大耕地面积，举办农贷。（三）提高耕作技术实行精耕细作，加强经营管理，以此逐步达到经营企业化管理民主化等。最后，他勉励全体职工干部努力学习克服缺点，为完成一九五○年恢复与扩大耕地十三万亩增产一万万斤稻谷的生产计划而努力。
