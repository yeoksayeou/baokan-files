Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 18th. Implementing the directives of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on training rural Party cadres, the CCP committees of various counties in Hebei Province, under the direct leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, have been extensively training rural Party members and have achieved initial results. With the exception of some severely disaster-stricken areas, counties in Hebei Province generally began training Party cadres in early December of last year. The first phase of training has now been completed, and the second phase is underway. In some counties, the second phase has also been completed. According to statistics from 36 counties, including Ding County, Qingyuan County, and Jingxing County, 13,425 Party cadres have been trained. After receiving training, Party cadres, in conjunction with members of the CCP district committees in their respective districts, conduct universal training for ordinary Party members. This universal training is now underway in one-third of the villages. It is expected that all 800,000 Party members in the province will complete the universal training before the Spring Festival. The working enthusiasm of the trained Party members has greatly increased, making them the core of various construction works in the countryside.

The training period is generally more than ten days, and the content mainly focuses on education in historical materialism (emphasizing the future of the revolution) and education on various policies in the current New Democratic construction. Based on the teaching materials compiled and printed by the Provincial Party Committee, combined with the ideological situation of Party members, and through lectures and discussions, the majority of Party cadres have made progress in their ideology and politics and have a clearer understanding that the great goal of the Communist Party is to realize a communist society, realizing the consistency of personal future and the future of the revolution. Sun Guocai, a Party member in Ding County, said: "After the land reform, I was allocated houses and land, and I felt that the revolution had succeeded. Now I understand that only in a communist society can poverty be completely eliminated." Another gain from the training of rural Party members is that, after training, Party members have conducted self-criticism in accordance with the principles of the Party, generally improving their work enthusiasm and initially resolving issues such as disunity and lack of democracy in the branch. Among the 27 village branches in Anping County that were disunited before the training, 25 village branches have eliminated unprincipled disputes and achieved initial unity after the training.

The general practice in training is to let Party members speak first and then conduct education according to the plan of the leading organs. Most Party cadres have many ideological problems that need to be solved urgently when they first arrive at the school. For example, some want to talk about the difficulties in their work, some want to clarify who is right and who is wrong because of disputes in the branch, and some want to praise their own achievements, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to hold one or two group meetings before the class to let them talk about their main opinions, then give a simple answer, propose a plan for gradual solution in the future, and then quickly switch to the formal training courses, requiring them to listen carefully. The arrangement of courses is to first carry out education in historical materialism to enlighten the Party members' political consciousness, and then carry out various policy education on New Democratic construction, such as labor mutual assistance, development of production, establishment of cooperatives, and steadily transforming the agricultural country into an industrial country, so that Party members clearly understand the current construction policies; finally, lecturing on "How to be a good Party member" and mobilizing Party members to conduct criticism and self-criticism. The last course should not be too long and should be conducted at the end of the training. A few county CCP committees, because they did not seriously study the new spirit of the instructions of the higher Party committee and adhered to narrow experience, believed that the training was mainly to solve the immediate problems, resulting in "dealing with matters as they arise" and entangled in the immediate problems. As a result, the ideological awareness of Party members could not be improved, and the problems could not be completely solved.

During the training, the district CCP committees also sent a certain number of cadres to participate in the training, which not only improved themselves but also strengthened the leadership of the training class. After the training, they returned to the village with the trained Party members and carried out the universal training of rural Party members together, which was very effective.

### 河北农村党员干部第一期集训已完成  三分之一村庄正普训一般党员

    河北农村党员干部第一期集训已完成
    三分之一村庄正普训一般党员
    【新华社保定十八日电】河北省各县中共党委会执行中共中央华北局集训农村党员干部的指示，在省委直接领导下，大量集训农村党员，已取得初步成绩。除部分灾情严重地区外，河北各县于去年十二月初开始，普遍集训党员干部，第一期训练现已全部结束，第二期正进行中，有些县份第二期训练亦已结束。据定县、清苑、井陉等三十六个县统计，已集训党员干部一万三千四百二十五名。党员干部在受训后，即与各该县中共区委委员结合，进行一般党员的普训工作，这种普训工作现在已有三分之一的村庄开始。全省八十万党员预计在春节前即可普训完毕。受过训练的党员的工作积极性都大为提高，成为农村各项建设工作的核心。
    训练时间一般是十多天，内容主要是唯物史观（着重说明革命前途）和目前新民主主义建设中的各种政策教育的教育。依据省委编印的教材，结合党员思想情况，经过讲解和讨论，多数党员干部在思想上和政治上都提高了一步，更加清楚地认识了共产党的远大目的是实现共产主义社会，觉悟到个人前途与革命前途的一致性。定县党员孙国材说：“土改后分了房子地，觉着革命成功了。现在才明白只有到共产主义社会，才能彻底消灭贫穷。”农村党员训练工作的另一个收获是：经过训练，党员们都以党的原则进行了自我检讨，普遍提高了工作积极性，并初步解决了支部中不团结、不民主等问题。安平县集训前闹不团结的二十七个村支部中，经过集训后已有二十五个村支部消除了无原则的纠纷，达到初步团结。
    训练中的一般作法是先让党员说说话，再按照领导机关的计划进行教育。多数党员干部初到学校时都存在不少迫待解决的思想问题，例如有的想诉说工作中的困难，有的因支部闹意见想弄清谁是谁非，有的想表扬自己的功绩等等。所以，在上课以前就需要开一、二次小组会，让他们把主要意见说说，然后作一个简单的解答，提出以后逐步解决的方案，接着就迅速转到正式的训练课程，要求他们安心听课。课程的排列，首先是进行唯物史观的教育，以启发党员们的政治觉悟，再进行新民主主义建设的各种政策教育，如劳动互助、发展生产、成立合作社、稳步地把农业国变为工业国等，使党员们明确认识当前的各种建设方针；最后是讲授“怎样作一个好党员”，发动党员进行批评和自我批评。最后一项课程时间不要太长，并且应在训练的末尾进行。有少数县份的中共县委因为没有认真研究上级党委指示的新精神，拘守狭隘经验，认为训练主要是解决眼前问题，结果形成“就事论事”，纠缠于眼前问题，结果党员思想觉悟不能提高，问题也就不能获得彻底解决。
    在集训中，各区区委会也派送一定数量的干部参加受训，这样不但他们本身获得提高，而且也加强了训练班的领导。训练后他们与受训党员一同回村，一同进行农村党员的普训工作，收效甚大。
