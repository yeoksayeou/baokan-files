    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 12th: TASS, London, January 11th: The General Secretary of the British Communist Party, Pollitt, published a statement in the Daily Worker regarding the upcoming British parliamentary elections, stating: "This general election will be one of the most important in British history. The Communist Party enters the field, putting forward 99 candidates to fight for constructive social policies at home and peaceful policies internationally."

    Pollitt pointed out that the British Communist Party had done its best to establish a united front against the Conservative Party in this election struggle, but was rejected by the Labor Party leaders because they refused to oppose capitalism. He said: "We are convinced that the Conservative Party will suffer a decisive defeat, just as in 1945. But the working people also need to use their votes to show that they also oppose the Labor government's predatory policies."

    Pollitt called on every Communist Party member to strive for the election of Communist Party candidates. He pointed out: A large number of Communist Party members elected to Parliament will be of great value in promoting a change in Britain's current disastrous policy line.

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 12th: The British parliamentary (House of Commons) election has been set for February 23rd. According to a United Press report: British Prime Minister Attlee announced on the 10th that the current parliament will be dissolved on February 3rd, with re-elections held on the 23rd. The newly elected members will take office and elect a speaker on March 1st, and the new parliament will convene on March 6th. The current British parliament was elected in July 1945, with Labor Party members occupying 393 seats. According to the British Representation of the People Act of 1945, this session should elect 640 members of the House of Commons.

    英共参加选举斗争
    波立特号召争取英共候选人获选
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社伦敦十一日讯：英国共产党总书记波立特，在工人日报上就英国即将举行的国会选举发表声明称：“这次大选将是英国历史上最重要的一次。共产党进入阵地，提出九十九名候选人，为国内建设性的社会政策和国际的和平政策而战斗。”
    波立特指出，英国共产党曾尽力在这次选举斗争中建立反对保守党的统一战线，但遭到工党领袖们的拒绝，因为他们拒绝反对资本主义。他说：“我们深信，保守党将遭到决定性的失败，恰如在一九四五年一样。但劳动人民也需要用他们的选票，来表明他们也反对工党政府的掠夺政策。”
    波立特号召每一个共产党员，努力争取共产党候选人获选。他指出：大批共产党员选入国会，对于促进英国现行灾难性政策路线的改变，将有巨大价值。
    【新华社北京十二日电】英国议会（下院）选举，已定于二月二十三日举行。据合众社讯：英首相艾德礼十日发表公告称：本届议会将于二月三日解散，于二十三日举行改选，新议员选出后，将于三月一日就职并推选议长，三月六日新议会开会。按英国本届议会系于一九四五年七月选出，工党议员占三九三席。根据英国一九四五年人民代表法，本届应选出下院议员六四○人。
