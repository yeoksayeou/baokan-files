The nature of the cultural schools for organs is that of regular supplementary schools for cadres with an educational level below that of higher primary school.

[Report from our newspaper in the Northeast] The Political Department of the Northeast Military Region recently issued "Instructions on Establishing Cultural Schools for Organs," deciding that in the first half of this year, cultural supplementary schools for organs should be universally established in military and political organs above the division level to extensively carry out on-the-job cultural education for cadres and to regularize it. The instructions stipulated the nature and characteristics of cultural schools for organs, pointing out that they are cultural supplementary schools for cadres with an educational level below that of higher primary school (military and political organs directly under the Northeast Military Region and military regions of various provinces should add junior high school classes when conditions permit), using evenings or mornings for centralized study; it focuses on improving the cultural level of cadres, but it must also have a certain amount of time for current affairs and policy education, in order to integrate with the current thinking and work of cadres; it should carry out systematic and planned regular education, establish regular systems over a longer period of time, and proceed step by step in an orderly manner.

Heads of organs must be responsible for supervising and inspecting the progress of the work of cultural schools. The school should have a full-time principal if possible.

Regarding organization and leadership, the instructions stipulate: (1) The leadership of the cultural schools of organs should be responsible by the organ Party committees and heads of each unit to supervise and inspect the progress of educational work, and help solve specific difficulties. All branches and administrative departments should effectively guarantee it. A school affairs committee should be formed jointly by the person in charge of the organ Party committee, the principal, the dean of teaching affairs, and the political instructors in the units to implement collective leadership. (2) The school should have a full-time principal as much as possible (if there is no such person, it can be concurrently held by the person in charge of the organ Party committee or the administrative head of the organ unit), and a dean of teaching affairs (also can be concurrently held by the principal), with several full-time cultural teachers and part-time teachers, who are responsible for teaching under the leadership of the principal and the dean of teaching affairs. General cultural teachers should be appointed from within who have a certain cultural level and teaching experience. If it is impossible to solve this internally, external teachers can also be appropriately hired. (3) Students are divided into several levels such as A, B, C... and several classes are set up for teaching. Each class elects one class leader to be responsible for supervising and inspecting on-time attendance and collecting assignments. Several learning mutual aid groups can be formed in the class according to different levels.

Raise the level of illiterate and semi-literate people to the level of higher primary school graduation within two or three years.

The instructions state: The length of schooling and the class system are not specifically stipulated, but it is required that illiterate or those who are rudimentary literate should be generally raised to a level equivalent to higher primary school graduation within two or three years. Those who pass the graduation examination can graduate and be issued a graduation diploma by the school. As for the curriculum, this year, it is uniformly stipulated to be three subjects: Chinese, Arithmetic, and Politics, with Chinese as the main subject. Classes are taught for two hours a day, five days a week for a total of ten hours, with Saturdays and Sundays off. The general provisions for the education time of each subject are four hours per week for Chinese and Arithmetic, and two hours for Politics. When dividing levels, a combination of self-reporting and examination should be adopted, and the school affairs meeting will finally determine the level. According to the different levels of different courses, it can be graded by subject, such as Chinese being in level A, and Arithmetic can also be in level B or C.

Teaching method: less lecturing and more practice, combining cultural learning with work; all courses must be previewed and reviewed.

Teaching methods should be adapted to the characteristics of students, with less lecturing and more practice. The instructions wrote: The students are cadres, adults, with social experience and revolutionary struggle experience, and have a certain political level and strong understanding. Therefore, cultural lessons - especially Chinese lessons - do not need to spend a lot of time explaining like elementary school students; but on the other hand, these students are older, have poor memory, and in the past, due to the limitations of the war environment and work, they learned some things but lacked solid practice, and the situation of being able to recognize but not write or being able to write but not use is quite common, so it is particularly necessary to emphasize repeated practice and do more homework, learn composition methods and master mathematical formulas from practice. Generally, the amount of Chinese and arithmetic assignments each week should not be less than twice each. Secondly, cultural learning should be combined with work. The students are all undertaking certain work tasks, and in the past, they have deeply felt the pain of not having culture in their work. After entering school, they urgently request to learn culture to solve their specific difficulties; therefore, cultural teaching must be closely combined with work. For example, write more letters in assignments, write work diaries, write various reports, do more exercises of various practical application problems, etc. In this way, on the one hand, what is learned is immediately useful and promotes the work, and on the other hand, it improves the learning mood and learning efficiency. In addition, all courses must be previewed and reviewed, and teachers should patiently guide and inspire students' learning consciousness and enthusiasm to solve the problem of being able to learn well and master heavier homework in a short class time.

The instructions stipulate a strict examination and grade promotion and demotion system, reward and punishment system, leave application and roll call system, transfer system, and meeting system. It also resolved the issue of funding, and determined that it would be paid from education fees and study fees respectively. The textbooks for each subject are uniformly using the textbooks compiled and printed by the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region.

Under the combination of voluntary and compulsory, all cadres below the level of higher primary school will participate in cultural learning.

Finally, the instructions require that full mobilization work be carried out before the start of school to dispel all concerns and strive to have all cadres below the level of higher primary school participate in cultural learning under the combination of voluntary and compulsory. When certain responsible cadres cannot attend classes on time due to specific circumstances, they should be organized into self-study mutual aid groups separately, and someone should be designated to be responsible for helping them learn, but they must still participate in various examinations, and their academic performance must not lag behind other students.

    东北军区师级以上机关将普建文化学校
    政治部指示各项具体方针
    机关文化学校的性质，是机关高小以下文化程度之干部的正规补习学校。
    【本报东北讯】东北军区政治部顷发出“关于建立机关文化学校的指示”，决定本年上半年在师以上军政机关普遍建立机关文化补习学校，以广泛开展在职干部文化教育，并使之走向正规化。指示对机关文化学校的性质与特点作了规定，指明它是机关高小以下文化程度之干部的文化补习学校（东北军区及各省军区的直属军政机关在条件许可时应增设初中班），利用晚间或早晨进行集中学习；它以提高干部的文化水平为主，但也必须有一定时间进行时事政策教育，以求与当前的干部思想、工作相结合；它应有系统有计划地进行正规教育，以较长的时间，建立正规制度，按步就班，循序渐进。
    机关负责人须负责督促检查文化学校工作之进行。学校尽可能设专任校长。
    关于组织与领导，指示规定：（一）机关文化学校的领导应由各单位的机关党委和首长负责督促检查教育工作的进行，并帮助解决具体困难。各支部及行政部门应有效地予以保证。以机关党委负责人、校长、教务主任及单位中政治指导员参加共同组成校务委员会，实行集体领导。（二）学校内尽可能设专任校长一人（如无此人可由机关党委负责人或机关单位行政首长兼任），教务主任一人（亦可由校长兼任），下设数名专职文化教员和兼职教员，在校长及教务主任领导下，分别负责进行教学工作。一般的文化教员应由内部聘请具有一定文化水平和教学经验者担任，如内部确无法解决时，亦可适当聘请外部教员。（三）依学员程度分为甲乙丙……数级，设若干班教学。每班选班长一人，负责督促检查按时到课与收集作业。班内并可按不同程度混合编成若干学习互助组。
    两三年内使文盲半文盲提高到高小毕业水平。
    指示称：修业年限及级制不作具体规定，但要求在两年或三年内使文盲或粗通文字者普遍提高到相当高小毕业程度。经毕业考试及格者，即可毕业，并由学校发给毕业文凭。至于课程，本年度则统一规定为国文、算术、政治三科，以国文为主。每日授课两小时，每周授课五日共十小时，星期六、星期日休息。各科教育时间一般的规定为每周国语、算术各四小时，政治二小时。在划分级别时，应采用自报与考试相结合的方法，最后由校务会议确定。根据不同课程的不同程度，可分科编级，如国文在甲级，算术也可在乙级或丙级。
    教学方法：少讲多练，文化学习与工作结合；一切课程必须经过预习复习。
    教学方法要适应学员的特点，少讲多练。指示写道：学员是干部，成年人，有社会经验和革命斗争经验，有一定政治水平，理解力较强，因之，文化课——特别是国文课就不需要像小学生那样用很大时间去讲解；但另一方面，这些学员的年龄比较大，记忆力差，过去因受战争环境和工作的限制，学了一些东西缺少踏踏实实练习，能认不能写或能写不能用的情形相当普遍，因此就特别需要强调反复练习，多搞作业，从练习中学会作文方法和熟练数学公式。一般的每周国文和算术作业各不得少于两次。其次，文化学习要与工作结合。学员都担负着一定的工作任务，过去在工作中已深感没有文化的痛苦，入学后迫切要求学习文化解决其具体困难；因此，文化教学须与工作密切结合。如在作业中多写信，写工作日记，写各种报告，多演算各种实际应用题等等，这样一方面学了马上有用，推动了工作，一方面提高了学习情绪，学习效率就大。此外，一切课程必须经过预习复习，教员要耐心指导，多启发学员的学习自觉性与积极性，来解决在短的授课时间内能学好学熟较繁重的功课。
    指示规定了严格的考试与升降级制度，奖惩制度，请假点名制度，转学制度，会议制度。并对经费问题作了解决，确定分别由教育费、学习费开支。各科教材则统一使用东北军区政治部编印的教材。
    在自愿与强制结合下，所有高小程度以下的干部，全数参加文化学习。
    最后，指示要求在开学前充分进行动员工作，打消一切顾虑，求得在自愿与强制结合下，所有高小程度以下的干部全数参加文化学习。某些负责干部依据具体情况不能按时上课时，应另行编成自修互助小组，指定专人负责帮助其学习，但仍须参加各种考试，学习成绩不得落后于其他学员。
