Serving the People Requires Cooperation with National Construction
    Development of Private Industry in the Capital
    Workers Actively Produce, Government Helps Solve Production and Sales Difficulties; More Than 2,000 New Households Added in One Year

    Under the support of the People's Government, private industry in Beijing achieved considerable recovery and development in the past year. The total number of factories in the city (excluding handicraft workshops and special handicrafts) reached 5,002 by the end of December last year, an increase of 75 percent compared to the total of 2,851 before liberation (December 1948). The number of employees in the latter half of last year was 29,761, an increase of 40 percent compared to the first half of the year. Among these factories, those that meet the current needs of the national economy and the people's livelihood have not only resumed production but also achieved great development. For example, in the machine and iron industry, the number of factories increased from 745 to 1,018, and the number of employees doubled. In terms of products, the production of waterwheels alone reached more than 7,900 units, exceeding the pre-liberation annual output by 40 to 50 times. The number of workers in the mechanized flour industry increased by 59 percent, and the number of flour mills increased by 43 percent. The annual output of flour was 2.3 million bags, more than double the output in 1948. In addition, the rubber industry and other industries have also achieved great development. However, some industries, such as papermaking and match making, although needed by the people, have only recovered to the pre-liberation production level without improvement due to the lack of raw materials, low quality, or poor sales efforts. Furthermore, industries such as soap making and knitting have increased several times in number compared to before liberation, but most of them are small in scale and low in quality, so they have not achieved significant development. In addition, several large chemical factories have been newly established in Beijing, such as paint and organic solvent factories.

    In the year since liberation, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has implemented the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and developing production, providing various supports to private industry. First, it publicized and explained policies to eliminate capitalists' concerns. Then, it guided the direction of production, such as encouraging the machine and iron industry to produce for the countryside and cooperate with national economic construction. Industrial exhibitions were held and visits to the Northeast and Northwest were organized to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. It guided private factories to improve production technology, which improved the quality of products such as rubber and soap. It helped solve production and sales difficulties, creating new ways of joint operations for the soap and knitting industries. In addition, it provided great assistance to private industry in terms of supplying raw materials, exchanging finished products, providing bank loans, and reducing industrial taxes. This is the reason why private industry in Beijing has developed in the past year. But more importantly, it is due to the unprecedented increase in workers' awareness after liberation, which has played a positive and creative role in production. For example, the workers of the Ciheng Iron Factory, in order to complete the urgent task of making water pipes for the Ministry of Railways, completed the work originally scheduled for two and a half months in one and a half months under the leadership of Party and League members. During the assault, the workers put forward many rationalization proposals, which increased production efficiency and saved a lot of materials. The Yuansheng Match Factory caught fire in May last year. The workers bravely rescued the factory from a major disaster. Later, the workers used active production increase to compensate for the loss of more than 20 cases of matches. Such a working attitude of the workers has also motivated some capitalists to actively manage their businesses.

    In the process of recovery and development of private industry in the past year, there are still several problems in terms of business management and government support and guidance, which should be paid attention to and solved in future work:
    Future Attention Should Be Paid To: Organizing Industry Joint Operations to Improve Business Management

    1.  The experience of joint operations in the past year has proved that joint operation is a good way for small factories to concentrate their strength, jointly overcome production and sales difficulties, reduce costs, and improve quality. Factories that have already formed joint operations include weaving and dyeing, soap making, cigarette making, and knitting industries. The scope of joint operation includes full joint operation of production and sales, and joint operation limited to joint production or joint sales. Among them, the joint operation of five companies including Lizhong in the soap industry was successful, reducing indirect production costs by 60 percent, concentrating excellent machinery and technology, improving quality, and achieving good sales. During the two-month joint operation period last year, a net profit of 9 percent was achieved, reversing the previous state of losses of each factory before the joint operation. After the joint operation of five companies including Xieshengxin in the weaving and dyeing industry, due to the large amount of foreign debt owed by the capitalists and the idea of simply relying on the government, there was a lack of real active production intention, so it failed. Most of the remaining joint operations have improved compared to decentralized operations. Based on the above experience, this year, on the basis of voluntary self-reliance, joint operations should be organized on a large scale in industries with development prospects, from the purchase of raw materials and the production process to market promotion. In the work, we must adopt flexible methods of comprehensive joint operation or partial joint operation according to the specific situation of each industry and each factory. Special attention should be paid to fully deliberating and carefully considering the joint operation method in advance, and it is advisable to organize cooperatives for the joint operation of independent small producers.

    2.  Business management in private factories is in urgent need of improvement. In terms of operation, general factories do not have cost accounting, and many factories do not even have modern accounting. Production has no standards, no systems, and no accounting. The profits and losses of machine and iron factories are often calculated unclearly. It is not known how much iron is melted per kilogram of coke, and how much work is required for a piece of work. In terms of management, most factories are not democratic enough, do not understand the importance of relying on workers to develop production, and despise workers. The capitalists of Tiancheng Iron Factory could not manage the factory and did not adopt the workers' suggestions, resulting in losses and disputes over the dismissal of workers. On the contrary, it is easier to solve the difficulties in production if democracy can be implemented and workers' opinions are valued. Jingwei Weaving Factory established a factory affairs management committee last summer, leading workers to inspect finished products to improve technology, and leading workers to reorganize labor. The output in September (the slack month for the weaving and dyeing industry) increased sharply to 1,825 pieces, an increase of two times compared to the output in March. Most factories do not pay attention to workers' welfare, and even the minimum labor protection is not provided. They are unwilling to employ long-term workers and technicians, and mostly employ temporary workers and apprentices. Apprentices who should be promoted to workers are not promoted, and some temporary workers are still temporary workers even after working for a year. Individual factory capitalists even win over workers not to organize trade unions and not to participate in the industry's trade union to negotiate collective labor contracts, which is detrimental to the development of production.

    3.  In the past year, many private factories such as machinery, electrical, flour, weaving and dyeing, knitting, rubber, brick and tile kilns, etc., have undertaken many processing orders for state-owned enterprises. In the future, the number of such processing orders will increase, but in the past, there was a lack of unified management institutions, especially in the machinery and electrical industries. The processing order profits between state-owned enterprises were inconsistent, which affected the quality, and the productivity of private factories could not be properly adjusted and used. At the same time, some state-owned enterprises were not good at cooperating with private factories, so the production tasks were not well completed. This lesson should be addressed in the future.

    4.  In the past year, the Municipal Bureau of Industry has achieved success in guiding private factories in production, but in terms of guidance methods, it failed to grasp the typical breakthrough point to gain experience; secondly, the guidance of production work did not go deep into the masses of workers, and did not cooperate with the work of the trade union. For example, when discussing the improvement of technology and quality in the soap making, cigarette making, and smelting industries, capitalists were simply called to attend meetings, but the capitalists either did not understand the technology at all or did not convey it to the workers after the meeting. In actual production, it could not achieve sufficient results in improving technology. In addition, the complete transformation of the original capitalist organizations of the same industry association has been neglected, far behind the production needs of today, so that the same industry association has not been able to fully play the role of leading the same industry to improve quality and improve business management. At the same time, the Bureau of Industry cannot have a comprehensive and correct understanding of the production situation of various industries.

    服务人民需要配合国家建设
    首都私营工业发展
    工人积极生产，政府帮助解决产销困难，一年来增加二千余户
    北京市私营工业在人民政府扶植下，在去年一年内，获得相当的恢复和发展。全市工厂总数（不包括手工作坊、特种手工艺）到去年十二月底共有五千零二家，比解放前（一九四八年十二月）总数二千八百五十一家增加了百分之七十五。职工人数去年后半年有二万九千七百六十一人，比去年前半年增加了百分之四十。在这些工厂中，适合目前国计民生需要的，不仅恢复了生产，而且获得很大发展。如机器铁工业，工厂由七百四十五家增加到一千零十八家，职工人数则增加一倍，产品中只水车一项，就制造了七千九百多台，超过解放前年产量四、五十倍。机制面粉业工人增加百分之五十九，磨粉机增加百分之四十三，全年产面粉二百三十万袋，超过一九四八年产量一倍多。此外橡胶业等也有很大发展。但有些行业，如造纸、火柴等业虽为人民所需要，因原料缺乏，品质低，或推销工作做得不好，只是恢复了解放前生产水平，还没有提高。又如造胰、针织等业，虽然家数比解放前增加了数倍，但是大部分是生产规模太小，品质低，所以没有大的发展。此外，北京还新设了几个较大的化学工厂，如油漆、有机溶剂工厂等。
    解放一年来京市人民政府贯彻了劳资两利、发展生产的政策，给予私营工业种种扶植。首先是宣传解释政策，消除了资本家的顾虑；接着，指导生产方向，如鼓励机器铁工业生产面向农村与配合国家经济建设等。为打开城乡物资交流举办过工业展览会和组织东北、西北参观团。指导私营工厂改进生产技术，使橡胶、造胰等业产品质量有所提高；帮助解决产销困难，创造了造胰、针织等业联合经营新方式；此外，在供给原料、换购成品、银行贷款、减征工业税等方面，对私营工业帮助都极大。这是一年来京市私营工业获得发展的原因。但更重要的一点，还在于解放后工人觉悟的空前提高，在生产中发挥了积极性和创造性，如慈型铁工厂工人为完成给铁道部承做水管的紧急任务，在党、团员带头下，把原来两个半月的工作于一个半月中突击完成。在突击过程中，工人提出许多合理化建议，增加了生产效率，还节省不少材料。原生火柴厂去年五月着火，工人奋不顾身抢救未成巨灾，后来工人又用积极增产的办法，弥补了二十余箱火柴的损失。工人这样的劳动态度，带动了一些资本家也积极经营。
    去年一年私营工业的恢复与发展过程中，在经营管理和政府扶植指导等方面，还存在着下面几个问题，应当在今后工作中注意加以解决：
            今后应注意：组织行业联营改善经营管理
    一、一年来联合经营的经验，证明联营是小型工厂集中力量、共同克服产销困难、降低成本提高品质的好办法。已经联营的工厂有织染、造胰、卷烟、针织等行业；联营的范围，有的是全部产销联合，有的是仅限于联产或联销，其中造胰业利中等五家联营是成功的，减少了间接生产费百分之六十，集中优良机器和技术，品质提高，销路好，去年两个多月联营期间共获纯利百分之九，扭转了联营前各厂亏累状态。织染业协盛鑫等五家联营后，由于资方原欠外债很多，又抱着单纯依赖政府的思想，缺乏真正积极生产意图，所以失败了。其余联营的大部比分散经营情况转好。根据以上经验，今年应在自愿自力基础上对有发展前途的行业大量组织联营，由采购原料、生产过程到市场推销。在工作中要依各业各厂具体情况，灵活采用全面联营或是局部联营的办法，特别对联营方式要事前充分酝酿、周密考虑，对独立小生产者的联合则以组织合作社为宜。
    二、私营工厂中经营管理是亟需改进的。在经营上，一般工厂都无成本计算，还有很多工厂连新式会计都不具备，生产无标准、无制度、无核算，象机器铁工厂盈亏常是糊里糊涂计算不清，不晓得到底一斤焦炭化多少铁，一件活需多少工。在管理上，大部工厂不够民主，不大了解依靠工人发展生产的重要性，对工人轻视。天成铁工厂资方不会管理工厂又不采纳工人建议，致陷于赔钱，发生解雇工人纠纷。相反的，凡能实行民主重视工人意见，生产上的困难就容易解决。经纬织布厂于去年夏天成立了厂务管理委员会，领导工人检查成品提高技术，并领导工人改组劳动力，九月份（织染业的背月）的产量突增到一千八百二十五匹，较三月份产量提高达两倍。对工人福利大部工厂不重视，连起码的劳动保护也没有，不愿用长期工、技工，而多用临时工、学徒。学徒该升级为工人的不给升级，临时工有干一年仍是临时工的。个别工厂资方甚至拉拢工人不组织工会，不参加该业工会商订劳资集体合同，这是对发展生产不利的。
    三、过去一年内，很多私营工厂如机器、电气、面粉、织染、针织、橡胶、砖瓦窑等业，给国营企业承做许多加工订货，今后这种加工订货数量还会增加，但过去缺乏统一管理的机构，特别是机器、电气业，国家企业之间加工订货利润既不一致，影响了品质，对私营工厂生产力也不能适当调剂使用，同时，有些国家企业不善于和私营工厂配合，以致生产任务未能很好完成。这一教训，今后应设法解决。
    四、一年来市工业局指导私营工厂生产的工作是有成绩的，但在指导方法上未能抓紧典型突破一点取得经验；其次，指导生产工作未深入工人群众，与工会工作也不配合。如在讨论造胰、卷烟、冶制业改进技术提高品质时，单纯召集资本家开会，而资本家或者根本不懂技术或者会后不向工人传达，在实际生产中，不能收到足够的改进技术的效果。此外，对原来同业公会资方组织忽略加以全面改造，远落在今天生产需要的后面，以致同业公会还未能充分发挥领导同业提高品质改进经营管理的作用，同时，工业局对各业生产情况也就不能有全面的正确掌握。
