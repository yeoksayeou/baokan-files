Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 29th—The broad masses of the Korean people are enthusiastically responding to the "Appeal to the People" passed on the 9th by the Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front. The "Appeal to the People" calls on the Korean people to strengthen the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and vigorously support the South Korean people's guerrilla forces. Workers, peasants, staff members, cultural workers, and others in various regions of North Korea have held mass rallies in recent days, unanimously expressing their determination to support the armed struggle in South Korea with practical actions of overfulfilling the Two-Year People's Economic Construction Plan.

Hyun Jung-min, Chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Democratic Youth League, delivered a report on the tasks of the youth in the "Appeal to the People" at the Pyongyang Youth Congress. He said: The youth must participate in the struggle against the enemies of the people, must be models of selfless struggle, and must support the guerrillas with all their strength. The congress unanimously adopted a "Letter to All Korean Youth," urging them to rise up and fight against the Lee Seung-man traitorous clique in order to achieve the victorious realization of the program of the Fatherland United Democratic Front.

The movement to support the guerrillas in South Korea is unfolding in the vast rural areas of Gyeongsangbuk-do, Gyeongsangnam-do, Gangwon-do, Jeollabuk-do, and Jeollanam-do. The South Korean peasants, who hate the Lee Seung-man bandit gang, not only actively cooperate when the guerrillas launch attacks, but also spontaneously organize supply teams, secretly passing through the enemy's警戒線(jingjie xian) to send large quantities of grain, clothing, shoes, socks, cash, medicines, and letters of慰问(weiwen) to the guerrillas.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th—TASS Pyongyang dispatch: A strong guerrilla force in Cheongsong County, Gyeongsangbuk-do, South Korea, engaged the Lee Seung-man's "Suppression Battalion" on January 9, repelling the battalion and inflicting heavy casualties. On the 11th, another guerrilla force in Gyeongsangbuk-do routed two companies of the puppet army stationed in Andong County. Guerrillas operating in Hwasun County, Jeollanam-do, annihilated a platoon of Lee Seung-man's police force on January 10. On the 19th, a guerrilla force near Jiri Mountain City attacked a platoon of Lee Seung-man's army and a reactionary youth terrorist force of up to 2,000 people. After a fierce battle, they forced them to retreat. Lee Seung-man's army suffered more than 20 casualties.

In Lee Seung-man's army, the soldiers' hatred for the traitorous clique is growing daily, and incidents of soldiers defecting to the guerrillas are increasing. On January 14, a group of sailors from Gyeongsangnam-do joined the nearby guerrillas.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th—TASS New York dispatch: The New York Times correspondent in Seoul reported that the United States and the South Korean Lee Seung-man puppet "government" have signed a so-called "Mutual Defense Assistance Treaty" in order to further enslave South Korea economically and politically by American monopoly capital. The correspondent also stated that the United States and the Lee Seung-man regime have signed an agreement to "legitimize" the presence of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in Korea. The total number of the Military Advisory Group is now about 500.
