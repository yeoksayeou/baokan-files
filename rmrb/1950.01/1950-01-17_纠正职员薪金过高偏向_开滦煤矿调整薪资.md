    Correcting the Tendency of Overly High Staff Salaries
    Kailuan Coal Mine Adjusts Salaries
    [Our newspaper's Tangshan dispatch] Reporter Lin Li reports: The Kailuan Coal Mine has made preliminary adjustments to the phenomenon of overly high staff salaries in order to strengthen worker unity and reduce costs to develop production. Before liberation, the ruling class divided worker unity, and staff salaries were already excessively high. After liberation, deviations in the mine's work exacerbated this unreasonable phenomenon. For example, the salaries of 245 senior staff members were equivalent to the total expenditure of 5,365 ordinary workers. Some staff members received a monthly salary equivalent to over 59,000 catties of millet, equal to the income of 136 miners. The mine has a total of 5,883 staff members, and their excessively high salaries seriously increased the cost of coal. Currently, the cost of each ton of coal in state-owned coal mines in North China is about 40 to 50 catties of millet, while at Kailuan Coal Mine, it is more than two bags of flour. Coupled with poor management, this placed Kailuan in serious difficulty. In today's situation, where production has not yet returned to normal and the economic life of the people throughout the country remains extremely difficult, this practice is obviously inappropriate. In order to overcome difficulties, restore and develop production, strengthen worker unity, and overcome the unreasonable phenomenon of excessive wage disparities between staff and workers, adjusting salaries has become an urgent demand of advanced staff and the vast majority of workers since last autumn. The Kailuan mine management, the trade union, and the military representative jointly proposed an adjustment plan last October, first explaining to the staff the current difficult situation of Kailuan and disclosing the previously extremely secretive operating conditions and wage system. The trade union also organized staff to visit workers' homes and go down the mines to observe. When the staff saw the workers' arduous lives and intense work, they were deeply moved and voluntarily proposed to lower their salaries. As the thinking of both staff and workers gradually matured, the military representative announced the adjustment principles: not lower than the average wage level of the three months before liberation, not affecting the basic living standards of staff, and maintaining the correct practice of staff salaries being higher than workers' salaries. The past unreasonable eleven types of price-based wage index standards were changed to calculations based on the People's Bank's "折实单位" (zhé shí dān wèi, "real value unit"), and a progressive reduction system was restored to prevent excessively high staff salaries. Salaries above 70 "折实单位" were progressively reduced in seven levels (the highest for workers was 70 units). During the discussion and research among staff and workers, the workers first expressed their support and guaranteed to overcome difficulties together with the staff through increased production. The vast majority of the staff also supported the adjustment principles and proposed amendments to certain minor issues. After careful consideration of the staff's opinions by the mine management, the trade union, and the military representative, a formal resolution was made and the adjustment began in November of last year. After this adjustment, except for a slight reduction for the 91 senior staff members with a base salary of over 1,500 yuan, the other 4,000 people still had higher wages than the average level of the three months before liberation. Junior staff were 14% to 38% higher than the average level of the three months before liberation, middle-level staff were 22% to 34% higher, senior and middle-level staff were 6% to 29% higher, and senior staff with a base salary of less than 1,500 yuan were also 0.3% to 12% higher. This not only narrowed the salary gap between staff and workers, reducing a historical barrier between them, but also saved Kailuan a large amount of expenditure and reduced the cost of coal. However, the unreasonableness of the entire wage system – such as egalitarianism between ordinary workers and skilled workers, and a large number of redundant staff in the staff taking high salaries without doing work – has not yet been addressed, still hindering the full realization of workers' production enthusiasm. Further evaluation of positions and salaries, so that the wage system is truly reasonable and correct, still requires greater efforts from the Kailuan labor and management and the military representative.

    纠正职员薪金过高偏向
    开滦煤矿调整薪资
    【本报唐山专讯】记者林里报导：开滦煤矿对于职员薪资过高现象进行了初步调整，以加强职工团结，减低成本发展生产。该矿解放前由于统治阶级分化职工团结，职员薪资本已定的过高，解放后由于该矿工作中发生偏差更加重了这种不合理现象。如该矿二百四十五名高级职员的薪资，等于五千三百六十五个普通工人的全部开支，有的职员一人月薪合五万九千多斤小米，等于一百三十六个矿工的收入。该矿共有五千八百八十三名职员，由于薪资过高，便严重的增加了煤斤的成本。目前华北各公营煤矿每吨煤的成本约四、五十斤小米，而开滦煤矿却要两袋多面粉。加上经营情况不好，使开滦处于严重的困难中。在生产尚未走入正规，全国人民经济生活仍然异常困难的今天，这种做法显然是不妥当的。为克服困难，恢复与发展生产，加强职工团结，克服职工工薪悬殊过甚的不合理现象，从去秋以来，调整薪资就成了先进职员与广大工人的迫切要求。开滦矿方、工会与军代表遂于去年十月提出调整方案，先向职工说明开滦目前处境困难，把向来极端秘密的经营情况与工薪制度公开出来。工会并组织职员访问工人住宅下井参观，当职员们看到工人们刻苦的生活，紧张的工作，深受感动，自动提出降低薪资。在职工双方思想渐趋成熟的时候，军代表宣布调整原则为：不低于解放前三个月的平均工资水平，不影响职工的基本生活，并保持职员高于工人薪资的正确习惯。将过去不合理的十一种物价的工薪指数标准，改用人民银行的折实单位计算，同时恢复了为防止职员薪资过高的逐级递减制，薪资在七十个折实单位以上的分七级递减（工人最高为七十个单位）。在职工讨论研究中，工人首先表示赞成，并保证以多生产来和职员们共同克服困难；职员中的绝大多数也都拥护调整原则，同时对某些枝节问题提出修改意见，经矿方、工会与军代表认真考虑职工意见后，再做出正式决议，从去年十一月份开始调整。经过此次调整后，除底薪一千五百元以上的九十一位高级职员稍许减低外，其他四千余人仍高于解放前三个月的工资水平。初级职员较解放前三月平均水平高百分之十四到三十八，中级职员较前高百分之二十二到三十四，高中级职员高百分之六到二十九，不满一千五百元底薪的高级职员，也较前高百分之零点三到百分之十二。这不仅缩小了职员与工人间的薪资差额，使职工之间减少了一重历史隔膜，更给开滦节省了一大笔开支，减低了煤斤成本。但整个工资制度的不合理——如普通工人与技术工人之间的平均主义、职员中大批拿高薪而不做事的冗员尚未处理，仍有碍工人生产热情的高度发挥。进一步评职评薪，做到工资制度的真正合理与正确，还有待于开滦劳资双方与军代表的更大努力。
