    Plundered Taiwan Salt
    Wu Yuanying
                (I) The Enemy's Bloodstained Claws
    In the southwestern part of Taiwan, north of Kaohsiung and near Tainan, the coastal area, due to its superior geographical environment, with scorching sunlight, strong winds, and little rain, is most suitable for salt production. This is the main production area of Taiwan Salt.
    The area of Taiwan suitable for developing salt fields is approximately 8,990 hectares, equivalent to over 7,400 chia (1 chia equals 14,548.8 square meters).
    According to the records in Jiang Risheng's "Taiwan Waiji," during the Zheng Chenggong era (1662-1683), "seawater was splashed and sun-dried to produce salt." This marked the beginning of the sun-drying salt method in Taiwan.
    In 1895 (the 21st year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty), after China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, the traitor Li Hongzhang signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki with the Japanese invaders. The Japanese seized Taiwan and, taking advantage of the western coastal area's suitability for salt production and the low production costs, made huge investments to establish numerous salt manufacturing corporations. After March 1943, these were merged into the Taiwan Salt Manufacturing Corporation, which produced salt in large quantities to supply their home country for consumption. After the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, the Japanese invaders regarded Taiwan as an "advanced military base" and implemented the so-called "industrialization of Taiwan" and "ten-year industrial development" plans. They actively engaged in the construction of defense industries, opened up vast industrial salt fields, and increased the production of industrial salt. They organized the South Japan Salt Industry Corporation, which began production in 1941. After the "July 7th Incident," this plan was accelerated. The larger Qigu and Zhongyuan salt fields were built during the war, possessing 2,210 chia of industrial salt fields, with six salt farms in Wushulin, Budai, Qigu, Beimen, Tainan, and Lukang. From March 1943 to "August 15th," only the Taiwan Salt Manufacturing Corporation and the South Japan Salt Industry Corporation existed in the Taiwan salt market. They implemented a monopoly, dominating the entire Taiwan salt industry. According to statistics from the Kuomintang Ministry of Finance, the income from the Japanese invaders' salt monopoly in Taiwan was:

    Year        Salt Monopoly Revenue (Taiwan Dollars)       Sales Volume (Metric Tons)
    1942    8,459,466 yuan    209,370
    1943    14,346,568 yuan   227,946
    1944    7,382,751 yuan     180,896
    1945    15,018,610 yuan   338,461

    Salt was one of the eight monopoly commodities during the Japanese occupation, with the highest revenue from monopoly commodities accounting for more than 49 percent of Taiwan's annual revenue. The revenue in 1940 even exceeded 100 million Japanese yen. Salt revenue was second only to camphor and Taiwan Sugar, demonstrating the situation of Taiwan Salt during the Japanese monopoly period.
    In 1944, the total consumption in Taiwan was only over 121,500 metric tons, while the amount of salt shipped to Japan reached 131,000 tons. This was the concrete realization of the Japanese invaders' massive plunder and the so-called "industrial Japan, raw materials from China" conspiracy.
    The Japanese invaders managed Taiwan Salt extremely cruelly. They adopted high-pressure tactics against salt workers, using cheap labor as a tool for exploitation and plunder of Taiwan. Of course, salt workers' welfare was out of the question.
    After "August 15th," the Kuomintang bandit gang's Salt Administration "took over" the Japanese invaders' salt industry in Taiwan, merging the Taiwan and South Japan Salt Industry Corporations to form the Tainan Salt Industry Company, which was later renamed the Taiwan Branch of the China Salt Industry Corporation, retaining only 3 percent of the shares for Taiwanese civilians. The company was located in Tainan, and all salt fields in Taiwan were operated by the company. There were over 7,000 li of salt fields in total, with 2,724 sections, some belonging to private individuals and some belonging to the company.
    However, after Taiwan's industry was taken over by the Kuomintang reactionary government, it was looted by the receivers, and 80 to 90 percent of it was in a state of paralysis. The average industrial production rate was only 20 to 30 percent of that during the Japanese occupation period. According to the 1947 China Economic Yearbook, Taiwan salt production in 1946 was 310,000 metric tons due to the exploitation of a large amount of cheap labor and favorable natural conditions, and production was still in surplus.

            (II) Taiwan's Salt Manufacturing Equipment and Methods

    Under the Japanese invaders' colonial wealth plunder and construction plan, the construction of salt farms in Taiwan has been continuously improved over the past 30 years and has reached a modern scale with centralized production and convenient transportation. The main structures of salt field types are mostly the same, divided into external and internal parts. The external parts are dikes and sluice gates, and the internal parts are water storage ponds, water supply channels, drainage channels, large evaporation ponds, small evaporation ponds, brine channels, crystallization ponds, and mother liquor channels.
    During the summer and autumn seasons each year in Taiwan, there are typhoons and rainstorms. The salt farm area is located on the southwest coast and bears the brunt of these, so local salt farms have built dikes for defense. Sluice gates are attached to the dikes for drawing seawater and draining fresh water. In the past ten years, most have been built with cement.
    Large evaporation ponds are used for seawater evaporation and are one of the main structures inside the salt field, accounting for 22 to 27 percent of the area of each salt field section. Crystallization ponds account for 14 percent of the area of each salt field section. The area inside the salt field, including large and small evaporation ponds, mother liquor channels, and crystallization ponds, is called a section. The area of each section varies in size, with earthen pan salt fields (i.e., industrial salt fields) being larger than tile pan salt fields.
    Taiwanese salt includes sun-dried salt, washed salt, and reprocessed salt. The main type is sun-dried salt. Due to favorable objective conditions, the quality is good, and in addition to meeting local needs, a large amount is transported to Japan. The second is washed salt and reprocessed salt. Both are refined from sun-dried salt. The salt quality is fine-grained and white in color, free of impurities, and comparable to European and American refined salt. During the Japanese occupation, it was used as Taiwan's table salt.
    Salt fields in Taiwan produce by-products such as gypsum and bittern. Gypsum is mostly supplied as raw material for Taiwan's cement industry. Bittern has many uses and can be used as raw material for chemical production of potassium, magnesium, and bromine. In 1946, the Taiwan Branch of the China Salt Company established a bittern chemical plant in Budai, producing gypsum with a purity of 85 percent and magnesium hydroxide with a purity of 60 percent.
    The quality of salt produced in Taiwan varies with the seasons. The salt produced during the small flood season (October to February of the following year) is the best, containing a high amount of chlorine and the fewest impurities. Washed salt contains more than 90 percent chlorine, reprocessed salt contains more than 88 percent chlorine, and sun-dried salt contains an average of 83 to 88 percent chlorine. Because of the high chlorine content, it is suitable for industrial use. Taiwan Salt is mostly supplied for local alkali production, soap, electrochemical industry, papermaking, oil refining, and fisheries.
    The alkali production industry is especially important. Caustic soda is a necessary raw material for the people's livelihood industry, and hydrochloric acid is an indispensable raw material for chemical drugs, the food industry, and daily industry. According to the 1948 China Economic Yearbook: the national annual demand for caustic soda and soda ash is approximately 120,000 tons; and the national annual supply mostly relies on the products of the Taiwan Alkali Industry Company and the Shenyang Chemical Plant. Taiwan is an ideal place for the alkali production industry because it is an ideal industrial salt production area. Industrial salt is the only major raw material for manufacturing alkali.

            (III) Characteristics of Taiwan Salt

    First, most of Taiwan's salt production is solar salt, which has low production costs. Second, the Northeast and North China areas have cold weather, and salt cannot be produced in winter, while Taiwan has evergreen seasons and can produce salt all year round. Third, Taiwan's salt fields have good soil quality, with clay accounting for 15 percent, and the repair and maintenance costs and production costs are not high. Fourth, the unit production volume of established salt fields is large, reaching 60 metric tons per chia (approximately 14 mu) per year. Fifth, the salt quality contains 90 percent sodium chloride, and the salt quality is excellent, light, and pure white.
    Salt is a necessity for people's livelihood and also the main raw material for alkali production and nitric acid and sulfuric acid industries. Therefore, the development of the salt industry is closely related to the development of light industry. Liberating Taiwan will not only complete the great cause of liberation, but also have abundant salt production and various resources to help the country overcome financial and economic difficulties and put its own country on the track of production and construction.

    被掠夺下的台盐
    吴元英
                （一）敌伪的血爪
    在台湾的西南部高雄以北，台南附近沿海地带，因为地理环境的优越，日光炎灸，风大雨少，最宜产盐，那就是台盐主要的生产地。
    台湾可辟盐田的面积，约有八、九九○公顷，合七千四百余甲——每甲合一四、五四八八市亩。
    根据江日升台湾外记的记载，郑成功时代（一六六二——一八六三年），所谓“泼海水卤，曝晒成盐。”这就是台湾晒盐方法的开始。
    一八九五年（清光绪二十一年）甲午战争中国失败后，卖国贼李鸿章与日寇签订马关条约，被日寇占据台湾，利用台湾西部沿海，适于晒盐，生产费用低廉诸条件，以巨额投资，组成了许多制盐株式会社。在一九四三年三月以后，合并为台湾制盐株式会社，大量生产，供应他本国食用。一九三一年“九一八”事变后，日寇以台湾为“前进兵站基地”，于是有所谓“工业化台湾”及“产业十年开发”计划，积极从事于国防工业的建设，大辟工业盐田，增产工业用盐，组织南日本盐业株式会社，于一九四一年开始生产。“七七”事变后，更加迅速的进行这个计划，规模较大的七股、钟渊等盐田，即是在战时兴建的，拥有工业盐田二千二百十甲，有乌树林、布袋、七股、北门、台南、鹿港六盐场。自一九四三年三月到“八一五”台盐场商，仅有台湾制盐株式会社及南日本盐业株式会社两家。实行专卖，垄断了整个台盐。据国民党财政部的统计，日寇专卖台盐所得的收入：
    年别        盐专卖收入（台币）       贩卖数量（单位公吨）
    一九四二年    八，四五九，四六六元    二○九，三七○
    一九四三年    一四，三四六，五六八元   二二七，九四六
    一九四四年    七，三八二，七五一元     一八○，八九六
    一九四五年    一五，○一八，六一○元   三三八，四六一
    盐是日寇统治时八种专卖品之一，专卖品最高收入曾占台湾岁收百分之四十九以上，一九四○年的收入，还突破一亿日圆。盐的收入仅次于樟脑及台糖，由此可见台盐在日寇专卖时期情形。
    一九四四年全台消费量，不过十二万一千五百余公吨，输往日本的盐就达十三万一千吨。这就是日寇大量掠夺，所谓“工业日本，原料中国”阴谋的具体实现。
    日寇管理台盐极为残酷。对于盐工，一味采取高压手段，利用廉价劳力，供作榨取和掠夺台湾的工具。什么盐工福利当然更不用提了。
    “八一五”后，国民党匪帮的盐务管理局“劫收”台湾日寇盐业，将台湾及南日本两盐业株式会社合并组织台南盐业公司，继又改为中国盐业公司台湾分公司，仅保留台民民股百分之三，公司设在台南，所有台湾盐场均归公司经营，各处盐田共七千多里，二千七百二十四副，一部分属私人，一部分属公司。
    但台湾工业归国民党反动政府接办后，经接收者的洗劫，十之八九在麻痹状态中，工业生产平均率仅及日本统治期内十之二三，台盐生产据一九四七年中国经济年鉴调查，由于剥削大量廉价劳力，及天然条件，一九四六年台盐生产量为三十一万公吨，生产仍有过剩。
            （二）台湾制盐设备及方法
    在日寇掠夺殖民地财富建设计划之下，台区盐场建设，三十年来，不断改进，已具现代化规模，生产集中，移运便利。盐田型式之主要构造，大都相同，分外部与内部两部分，外部为堤防及水闸，内部为贮水池、给水路、排水路、大蒸发池、小蒸发池、咸水溜、结晶池及母液溜等。
    台区每年夏秋之际，例有台风暴雨，盐场区滨西南海岸，首当其冲，因此当地盐场均筑堤防御。水闸附筑于堤防上，作汲引海水，排除淡水之用，最近十年来多以水泥建造。
    大蒸发池系供海水蒸发用，为盐田内部主要构造之一，它的面积占每副盐田百分之二十二至二十七。结晶池占每副盐田面积百分之十四，盐田内部，凡包括有大小蒸发池，母液溜、结晶池等设备者，称为一副，每副面积，大小不一，以土盘盐田（即工业盐田）较瓦盘盐田面积为大。
    台湾的盐，有晒盐、洗涤盐及再制盐。主要的为晒盐，晒盐因客观条件优厚，质量均佳，除供本地需用外，大量都是运到日本。其次为洗涤盐及再制盐，二者均由晒盐提炼而成，盐质粒细色白，无杂质，与欧美精盐不相上下，在日寇统治时代，作为台湾食盐。
    台湾盐田副产有石膏和苦卤。石膏大多系供作台湾水泥工业原料；苦卤用途很多，可供化学上制钾镁及溴的原料。一九四六年中盐公司台湾分公司在布袋设有一所苦卤化学工厂，产制纯度百分之八十五的石膏，以及纯度百分之六十的氢氧化镁。
    台湾产盐品质，因时而异，每年以小汛季（十月至翌年二月）所产盐质最好，含氯成分极多，杂质最少。洗涤盐含氯成分达百分之九十以上，再制盐含氯成分在百分之八十八以上，晒盐平均含氯成分在百分之八十三至八十八。因为含氯成分多，适宜作工业用途。台盐多供给本地制碱，肥皂，电化工业，造纸，炼油等工业应用，以及渔业用。
    尤以制碱工业最为重要，烧碱为民生工业必需原料，盐酸为化学药品，食品工业，日常工业所不可缺少的原料。据一九四八中国经济年鉴统计：全国全年烧碱和纯碱的需要量约十二万吨；而全国全年供给量大部分是依靠着台湾碱业公司和沈阳化工厂出品。台湾是一个理想的制碱工业地，因为她是理想的工业盐产地，工业盐就是制造碱的唯一主要原料。
            （三）台盐之特色
    第一，台湾的盐产，大部分是天日盐，生产费低廉。第二，东北华北一带，天气寒冷，冬天不能制盐，台湾四季长春，一年到头均可生产。第三，台湾盐田，土质良好，粘土占百分之十五，修缮维持费和生产费不大。第四，已设盐田面积单位生产量大，一甲（约合十四亩）年达六十公吨。第五，盐质含盐化曹达百分之九十，盐质优秀，轻松纯白。
    盐是民生必需品，也是制碱制硝酸硫酸工业的主要原料，所以盐业的发展和轻工业的发展有着密切关系的。解放台湾，不但是完成解放大业，而且有丰富的盐产及各种资源足以帮助国家克服财政经济的困难，使自己的国家转入生产建设的轨道。
