Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 14th: TASS, Paris, January 11th: According to a report in L'Humanité, the Political Bureau of the Moroccan Communist Party discussed the recent U.S.-French agreement on U.S. exports to Morocco and adopted a resolution stating: "The Political Bureau reiterates that the French imperialists have expanded the scope of goods that can be imported into Morocco without formal application for foreign exchange, offering this privilege to its American masters. The Political Bureau protests against the communiqué issued by the Governor-General of Morocco recognizing the U.S.'s retention of its excessive demands, as this poses a serious threat to our country's future."

The Political Bureau of the Moroccan Communist Party heard a report from its delegation on its talks with the Sultan, regarding "the imperialist plan to establish free zones in Casablanca and Kenitra." The delegation reminded the Sultan that the establishment of free zones would turn Morocco into a base for the imperialists to launch the war they are now preparing against the Soviet Union and the peoples of all countries fighting for freedom.

    摩洛哥共产党揭露法帝出卖阴谋  反对美帝进口特权
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社巴黎十一日讯：据人道报消息，摩洛哥共产党政治局讨论美法两国新近关于美国对摩洛哥出口的协定，并通过决议称：“政治局再次揭露，法帝国主义者扩大了无须正式申请外汇即可输入摩洛哥的物品范围，把这个特权献给它的美国主人。政治局抗议摩洛哥总督所发表的承认美国保持其非份要求的公报，因为这对于我们国家的前途是严重的威胁”。
    摩洛哥共产党政治局听取其代表团报告与苏丹会谈的经过，会谈的内容是关于“帝国主义在卡萨布兰卡及堪尼特拉建立自由区的计划”。代表团提醒苏丹：建立自由区会使摩洛哥变成帝国主义发动现在准备中的反对苏联及为自由而战的各国人民的战争基地。
