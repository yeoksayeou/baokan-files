Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: Comprehensive reports from TASS, Paris: Since the end of last year, a movement of French working people refusing to produce or transport war materiel has been developing. On the 27th, workers in the mechanics department of the Nanterre metallurgical factory in the Seine province near Paris refused to manufacture rifle stocks. The head of the department acted in concert with the foremen and workers, and the factory owner's interference was ineffective. Workers at the aiming device factory in Vierson, Cher, have sent a delegation to the factory management, demanding an immediate halt to the production of automatic gun models. When this request was rejected by the factory management, the employees decided at a general meeting to stop working for war purposes. The trade union committee representatives of France's largest cement factory, the Porges-Chassen factory, firmly opposed the export of French cement for military engineering purposes. The railway workers' union in Avignon (a necessary transit point for France to transport military supplies to Vietnam), northwest of Marseille, responded to the call of the French Women's Union and declared that Avignon's railway workers would not allow weapons for the criminal war against the Vietnamese people to pass through. Welders at the Fives-Lille locomotive factory in the Nord province have decided to suspend the production of locomotives used in the war against the Vietnamese people. They called on all workers in the city to stop assembling and transporting locomotives. Riveters at the factory have responded to this call. Employees at the Chaulnes-Louhans railway station have held a protest strike against the war of plunder being waged in Vietnam and passed a resolution declaring that they are determined to "prevent the transport of war materiel brought in by the Americans by all means." In Nantes, Lower Loire, the seamen's and dockworkers' unions have unanimously decided to refuse to handle war materiel. In La Rochelle, Charente-Maritime, the Federation of Trade Unions and the Unemployment Committee passed a resolution declaring: "La Rochelle will never become an anti-Soviet landing port." The unemployed said that they would not be employed to load and unload war materiel under any circumstances, and the seamen of the port have also taken the same decision, refusing to handle war materiel.

The "League of Vietnamese Working People in France" has issued an appeal to the working people of France, especially the dockworkers and sailors in Marseille, Toulon, Dunkirk, Le Havre, Bordeaux, Brest, and other ports, demanding that they stop French imperialism from fighting against Vietnam, and extending fraternal respect to the French dockworkers and sailors who stand at the forefront of the French people in opposing the war in Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: According to Agence Telegraphique Parisienne, Humanité reported that the movement in the French North African territory of Algeria against the French colonialists' involvement in the war in Vietnam is expanding.

Dockworkers in all ports in Algeria have participated in this movement, refusing to load materiel destined for ships bound for Vietnam. In Sétif, recruiting officers attempting to recruit young people and demobilized soldiers to go to Vietnam were driven away by poor peasants in the area. In Haute-Seinde, one hundred young recruits, responding to the call of the Algerian Women's League and the Algerian Democratic Youth League, demanded an end to the war against Vietnam and the repatriation of Algerian youths who were being sent to fight for French imperialists.
