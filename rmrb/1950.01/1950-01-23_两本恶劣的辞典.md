	Two Terrible Dictionaries
	(I)
	Editor: I bought a revised edition of the "New Knowledge Dictionary" published by Beixin Bookstore last September, edited by Gu Zhijian and Jian Ming. I found serious errors in it, and now I give two examples:
	(1) "John Leighton Stuart" American ambassador to China, born in Hangzhou, China in 1876. He came to China from the United States in 1904 to preach, and was an American who was familiar with China and quite friendly. (Page 422)
	(2) "Baita Mountain Incident"… There were two opinions in the country about the matter: (1) It was believed that this was not a simple local incident, but had an international background and was the beginning of the Soviet Union's planned invasion of China (a Central News Agency report once stated that four Soviet-marked aircraft participated in the attack). (2) It was believed that it was only a simple local matter, and the international community generally regarded it as a local dispute and did not pay attention to it.
	It is strange that everyone knows that John Leighton Stuart was a spokesman for American imperialism, a liar who deceived the Chinese people, but here he has become a "quite friendly American"?
	The so-called "Baita Mountain Incident" was entirely an act of provocation deliberately carried out by the Kuomintang reactionaries on the border of Outer Mongolia in order to create an anti-Soviet atmosphere. The dictionary actually interprets it as the beginning of the Soviet Union's planned invasion of China and uses the Kuomintang Central News Agency telegram as proof. If it is not a deliberate distortion of the facts, it is the ignorance of the editors.
	Finally, I propose:
	(1) I hope that the General Administration of Publications will conduct a thorough review of this "Dictionary" and correct it.
	(2) We need correct learning dictionaries. I hope Xinhua Bookstore can compile one for the vast number of people to learn from. (Reader Gu Yu)
	(II)
	Editor: The Beijing Zhonghua Printing Bureau has published a "New Democracy Learning Dictionary", authored by Li Zhuochang.
	This book is full of half-baked or completely fabricated fallacies, which will undoubtedly affect many comrades who are enthusiastic about learning Marxism-Leninism today. I think it is necessary to expose it.
	Here is an example. The book divides the "basic knowledge" of New Democracy into twenty categories, including so-called "Party" category, "Faction" category, "Theory" category, "View" category, "People" category, and "K" category. What exactly are these things? It turns out that the "View" category is "world view, historical view of people's livelihood"; the "People" category is "people, poor people"; and the "K" category is "Bolsheviks and Mensheviks." This kind of "classification" is the ultimate in absurd and ignorant acts!
	We hope that the General Administration of Publications will review this and hope that the Zhonghua Printing Bureau, which published the book, will conduct a thorough self-criticism and correct it immediately.

### 两本恶劣的辞典

    两本恶劣的辞典
    （一）
    编辑同志：我买了一本去年九月北新书局出版的订正本“新知识辞典”，主编人是顾志坚、简明。我发现其中有严重的错误，今举两个例：
    （一）“司徒雷登”美国驻华大使，一八七六年生于中国杭州。一九○四年自美来华传教，是一个熟悉中国，颇富友情的美国人。（四二二页）
    （二）“白塔山事件”……事情发生国内有二种意见：（一）认为这不是简单的地方性事件，是有国际背景的，是苏联有计划侵略中国的开始（中央社讯曾传有苏联标帜飞机四架参加攻击）。（二）认为仅是简单的地方性事情，国际间一般也以此为地方性纠纷，不予重视。
    很奇怪，司徒雷登谁都知道是美帝国主义的代言人，欺骗中国人民的骗子，但在这里居然成了“颇富友情的美国人”？
    所谓“白塔山事件”完全是国民党反动派为了制造反苏空气，在外蒙古边境故意挑衅的行为，该辞典竟解释为苏联有计划侵略中国的开始，并引用国民党中央社电讯作证明。如果不是有意曲解事实，也是编者之无知。
    最后，我提议：
    （一）希望出版总署，对此《辞典》进行彻底审查，加以纠正。
    （二）我们很需要正确的学习辞典，希新华书店能编一部以供广大人民学习之用。（读者谷禺）
    （二）
    编辑同志：北京中华印书局出版了一本《新民主主义学习辞解》，作者是李拙厂。
    这本书充满了一知半解或根本是无中生有的谬论，对于今天许多热心学习马列主义的同志们，不无影响，我认为有必要予以揭发。
    举一个例。该书把新民主主义的“基本知识”分成二十类，其中有所谓“党”类、“派”类、“论”类、“观”类、“民”类、“克”类。究竟是些什么东西呢？原来“观”类就是“宇宙观、民生史观”；“民”类就是“人民、贫民”；而“克”类就是“布尔雪维克和孟什维克”。这种“分类”，更是极尽荒谬无知的能事！
    我们希望出版总署对此加以审查，并希望出版该书的中华印书局，深刻地检讨一下，立即加以改正。
                                            （读者黎扬）
