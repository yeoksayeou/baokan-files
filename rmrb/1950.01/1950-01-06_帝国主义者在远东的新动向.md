    New Trends of Imperialists in the Far East

    Following the farce of the so-called "transfer of sovereignty" between the Dutch and the "United States of Indonesia" directed by US imperialism, the same trick is being played in Vietnam. The reactionary French government, implementing a plan put forward by the US State Department, had the French imperialist agent, High Commissioner for Vietnam Pinon, and the puppet Bảo Đại sign the "March 8th Agreement" on "transferring power" in Saigon on December 30th. Some countries influenced by the US-British bloc have already announced their recognition of the puppet regime of the Sukarno-Hatta reactionary group, which sold out the interests of the Indonesian people, and will soon recognize the puppet regime of Bảo Đại in the same way. Washington officials have stated that they will provide not only "economic aid" but also "military aid" to the former. For the latter, the US State Department plans to send a military mission headed by warmonger Bullitt to Hanoi to plan new measures to attack the Vietnamese people.

    Under the active promotion of MacArthur, the plan to rearm Japan is being accelerated. In his "New Year's message," MacArthur blatantly encouraged the revival of Japanese militarism, arrogantly pointing out that Japan, for the sake of "self-defense," could disregard the clause in the constitution that renounces war and rearm itself. According to the US Department of Defense, the four chiefs of staff of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff (including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the chiefs of staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force) are scheduled to visit Japan in early February "to discuss the Far East situation with MacArthur."

    At the same time, Jessup, Director of the "Far East Policy Research Group" of the US State Department and Ambassador-at-Large, has arrived in Japan. He will preside over the "US Far East Diplomatic Personnel Conference" to be held in Bangkok on February 13th. The diplomatic representatives conference of the British Empire Federation will be held in Colombo starting on the 9th of this month.

    What do all these facts show? It shows that when the remaining forces of the Chinese reactionary Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are eliminated on the Chinese mainland, when the people of Southeast Asian countries are encouraged by the great victory of the Chinese people and more heroically launch the struggle for national independence and people's democracy, the US and British imperialists, in order to maintain their exploitation and rule over colonies and semi-colonies, are hurriedly searching for new agents from the reactionaries in these countries, and politically and militarily strengthening their positions. They are scrambling to rearrange the "new plan" and "new strategy" for attacking the national liberation movement in Southeast Asia, and stepping up efforts to foster Japan's aggressive forces to make it the main tool for launching a new war. Therefore, the people of the Far Eastern countries who have already won victory or are striving for victory must be doubly vigilant against these conspiratorial activities of the US and British imperialists.

### 帝国主义者在远东的新动向

    帝国主义者在远东的新动向
    美帝国主义导演了荷兰与“印尼合众国”间所谓“移交主权”的滑稽剧之后，又在越南玩弄同样的戏法。法国反动政府执行美国国务院所提出的计划，由法帝国主义的代理人驻越高级专员皮农与傀儡保大，于十二月三十日在西贡签署“移交政权”的“三八协定”。美英集团影响下的一些国家，已宣布承认了出卖印尼人民利益的苏加诺——哈达反动集团的傀儡政权，不久也将同样承认保大的傀儡政权。对于前者，华盛顿官方表示不仅要给予“经济援助”，而且还要给予“军事援助”。对于后者，美国务院拟派遣以战贩布立特为首的军事使团赴河内，以策划进攻越南人民的新措施。
    在麦克阿瑟的积极推动下，重新武装日本的计划，正在加速进行中。麦克阿瑟在“新年文告”中，毫无掩饰地鼓励日本军国主义的复活，狂妄地指出日本为了“自卫”，可以不管宪法中废弃战争的条款，而重整军备。又据美国防部宣布，美参谋长联席会议的四参谋长（包括联席会议主席和海陆空三军的参谋长），定于二月初访问日本，“将与麦克阿瑟讨论远东局势”。
    与此同时，美国国务院“远东政策研究小组”主任、无任所大使耶塞普，已经到达日本。他将主持二月十三日在曼谷举行的“美国远东外交人员会议”。而英帝国联邦的外交代表会议，则将于本月九日起在科伦坡召开。
    所有这些事实表明什么呢？表明当中国反动派蒋介石匪帮的残余势力在中国大陆上被消灭时，当东南亚各国人民为中国人民的伟大胜利所鼓舞，而更英勇地展开争取民族独立与人民民主的斗争时，美英帝国主义者为了维持其对殖民地半殖民地的剥削统治，就正慌忙地从这些国家的反动派中找寻新的代理人，并在政治上和军事上加强他们的地位，就需要手忙脚乱地重新布置进攻东南亚民族解放运动的“新计划”和“新战略”，加紧扶植日本的侵略势力，使它成为发动新战争的主要工具。因此，已经获得胜利的或正在争取胜利的远东各国人民，对于美英帝国主义者的这些阴谋活动，不能不加倍提高警觉。
