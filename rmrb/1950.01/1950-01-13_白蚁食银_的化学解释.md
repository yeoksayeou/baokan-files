A Chemical Explanation of "Termites Eating Silver"
Tangshan Institute of Technology Chemistry Associate Professor Gao Yuncheng

In Dai Ming's *General Chemistry*, at the end of the first chapter, there is the following description: "Many fields of study seem unrelated to chemistry at first glance, but in reality, many are in contact with chemistry. In biographies and history, if we can read the meaning between the lines, we can often find chemical references." This is indeed the case, as exemplified by the record of termites eating silver in *Tiantian Xiaoshi*. According to *Tiantian Xiaoshi*: "...One hundred and fifty taels of silver were eaten by termites. The termites died and were put into a furnace, melted, and still yielded one hundred and fifty taels of silver, at which everyone laughed. Three years later, when he was sent to guard Quzhou, Yu Siqian said that when Lu Zhizhai was in charge of Guangdong, a warehouse clerk lost three thousand taels of silver and dug up several stones of dead termites in the warehouse cellar; melting them only yielded one thousand five hundred taels of silver. Silver is very hard, and ants are tiny creatures, so eating it is strange; melting ants into silver is even stranger; such things in the world are very incomprehensible." It can be seen that termites eating silver was an unexplained mystery for the ancients. According to chemistry, it is indeed a fact. The explanation is as follows: It is known that ants can secrete formic acid (HCOOH). (An organic acid, chemically named methanoic acid, is a colorless, transparent liquid with a pungent odor.) Formic acid can be obtained by distilling ants. The formic acid secreted by termites is more concentrated. When silver encounters the formic acid secreted by termites, it combines with it and turns into powdery silver formate (HCOOAg). The reaction formula is as follows:
          2Ag + 2HCOOH → 2HCOOAg + H2↑
            Silver        Formic acid        Silver formate        Hydrogen
The termites then swallow the silver formate into their abdomen. Silver formate is an unstable compound and decomposes very easily when subjected to slight heat or left standing. If the temperature is high in summer, the silver formate will undergo a chemical change in the abdomen before it is excreted. Silver formate is then reduced to gray-black powdery metallic silver. (An allotrope of silver, which can no longer react with the formic acid in the termite's body.) At the same time, formic acid and carbon dioxide are produced. The sudden production of a large amount of carbon dioxide in the termite's body, along with the powdery metallic silver that is not easily excreted, is the cause of the termite's death. Formic acid has a very strong antiseptic property, so the corpse does not decompose quickly. The reaction formula is as follows:
              2HCOOAg → HCOOH + 2Ag↓ + CO2↑
                Silver formate          Formic acid         Silver      Carbon dioxide
Suppose that in winter, because the temperature is low, the termites can still excrete a small amount of silver formate, but soon the above changes will occur. As for the fact that silver can still be obtained when termites are put into the furnace, it is because the gray-black powdery silver produced by the decomposition of silver formate in the termite's body, when subjected to strong heat from the furnace, melts and then condenses into ordinary white silver (silver melting point 960℃, the temperature is about close to a thousand degrees when the furnace emits white light). As for the reason why the silver obtained by melting termites is less than the original weight, it is because the termites escaped or excreted some silver formate before they died. The mystery that the ancients did not understand is no longer strange.

    “白蚁食银”的化学解释
    唐山工学院化学副教授  高云程
    戴明著的普通化学，在第一章的末尾，有这样的叙述：“许多学问初看似与化学无关，但实际上很多是和化学接触。传记与历史，我们若能详读其字里行间的意义，常能发现化学的参考资料。”这是实在的，如天香楼外史所记载的白蚁食银便是一例。据天香楼外史载：“……银一百五十两为白蚁所食，蚁死投入炉中，煎化仍得银一百五十两，群皆笑之。越三年出守衢州，余泗泉云，陆致斋按粤时，有一库吏失银三千两，亦于库窖内掘出死白蚁数石；煎化只得银一千五百两。夫银甚硬，蚁细物耳，食之亦异；煎蚁成银尤甚异矣；天地间此等甚不可晓。”可见白蚁食银是古人不解的谜。今按化学可知确是事实。兹解释如下：按蚁类均能分泌蚁酸（ＨＣＯＯＨ）。（一种有机酸，学名甲酸，是无色透明有刺激性臭的液体）如蒸馏蚁类均可得蚁酸，白蚁分泌的蚁酸较浓，银遇白蚁分泌的蚁酸，遂和它化合变为粉末状的蚁酸银（ＨＣＯＯＡｇ）。反应式如下：
          ２Ａｇ＋２ＨＣＯＯＨ→２ＨＣＯＯＡｇ＋Ｈ２↑
            银        蚁酸        蚁酸银        氢
    白蚁遂把蚁酸银吞入腹内。蚁酸银为不安定的化合物，受微温或静置，都极容易分解。假如当夏季气温较高，蚁酸银还未排泄，即在腹内发生化学变化。蚁酸银遂还原成灰黑色粉末状的金属银。（银之同素异形物，不能再和白蚁体内的蚁酸发生作用。）同时又生成蚁酸及二氧化炭。白蚁体内一时发生多量的二氧化炭，同时粉末状的金属银亦不易排出，实为白蚁致死的原因。蚁酸有极强的防腐性，所以尸体不致很快的腐烂。反应式如下：
              ２ＨＣＯＯＡｇ→ＨＣＯＯＨ＋２Ａｇ↓＋ＣＯ２↑
                蚁酸银          蚁酸         银      二氢化炭
    假设当冬天，因气温较低，白蚁尚能排出少许蚁酸银，不久也发生上述的变化。至于白蚁投入炉中仍能得银，是因白蚁体内由蚁酸银分解后发生的灰黑粉末状银，遇炉火强热，遂熔融又凝结为普通白色的银（银熔点９６０℃，炉火发白光时，温度约近千度）。至于所云煎化白蚁，得银不足原重量的原因，是因为白蚁当它未死以前逃失或排出一部分蚁酸银所致耳。古人不解的谜，已不足异。
