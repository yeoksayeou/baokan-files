            Preface
    (1) They say prostitutes are cheap,
    Winking and flirting to deceive,
    People value face, trees value bark,
    Who would willingly choose this dark?
    (2) They say prostitutes are dirty,
    Most of them have sores that are squirting,
    Born of parents, just like any other,
    Who would want to live like this, my brother?
    (3) I hate Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang,
    Setting up nets both wide and long,
    The poorer you are, the harder to survive,
    Forcing good daughters to become a whore alive.
    (4) Chairman Mao and the Communist Party came,
    The People's Government has a good aim,
    The old system is overthrown,
    Prostitutes can finally see the sun shown.

    Ladies and gentlemen, comrades, the folk song I just sang was originally written by Dong Meihua, a first-class prostitute from "Joy Hall," a once-famous brothel in Shijiazhuang City, after her liberation. It was published in many newspapers. How did she write such a folk song? Speaking of this, there is a story of joys and sorrows, bitter and sweet, angry and happy. Please be seated and listen to me slowly sing it to you:
            First Episode: Fleeing the Marriage
    Ladies and gentlemen, please keep your voices down,
    Listen to me sing a true tale from town,
    In Dezhou Prefecture, a maiden so fair,
    Her surname was He, He Guizhen by name, beyond compare.
    Her mother died when she was eight years old,
    At nine, a stepmother, harsh and cold,
    The stepmother was born with a fierce temper,
    Her own father was a soft earrender.
    Her father ran a small sundry shop, only plotting how to gain,
    He believed everything the stepmother said, again and again,
    Being beaten and scolded became commonplace,
    Poor Guizhen, whose mother had died long before, felt out of place,
    Not a single day passed without her skin being hurt,
    During the New Year or festivals, she never smiled, not even a spurt.
    Across the street lived a girl named Zhang Jinhua,
    The two of them were always akin,
    Jinhua had an older brother named Zhang Deqiang,
    She and Jinhua were born of the same kin,
    The siblings originally grew up in the countryside,
    Their parents were tenant farmers who toiled far and wide,
    Because of the drought and famine that year, they couldn't pay the rent and debt,
    Forcing them to be ruined, homeless, and depart, so upset,
    Jinhua's brother died when she was twelve, her mother at thirteen did cease,
    Relying entirely on their uncle to pass their time in peace,
    Their uncle sold junk in the small market,
    Also treating the Jinhua siblings as something dark.
    When Jinhua and Guizhen were together, they shared their woes,
    Zhang Deqiang, at one side, also sympathized,
    The three of them grew closer and closer,
    As the saying goes, "misery loves company," especially when surprised.
    One day, Guizhen brought tea to her stepmother,
    The stepmother resented her slowness and grew angry within,
    A punch landed on Guizhen's arm,
    The teacup fell to the ground, covered in sin,
    The stepmother became even more enraged,
    Lashing Guizhen all over with a leather hide,
    Beating her until the skin was raw and flesh did fly,
    And still wouldn't let Guizhen food confide,
    Even like this, the stepmother couldn't calm her rage,
    Pulling a rope from under the bed, to engage,
    Binding Guizhen to the locust tree,
    Condemning her to a sleepless night, can't you see.
    In the middle of the night, Zhang Deqiang climbed over the wall,
    Quietly untying the rope on the tree,
    Jinhua brought hot water and a big cake,
    Guizhen couldn't swallow, can't you agree,
    The three of them hugged each other and shed tears,
    Not daring to speak for fear of waking up everyone near,
    Seeing that the rooster would crow at dawn, day would soon arrive,
    They still had to tie her up and leave, each to strive,
    From then on, Zhang Deqiang and Guizhen were in love,
    Suffering people love other suffering people, from above,
    The two of them swore to heaven, "until we are old and gray,"
    Fire or water wouldn't tear them away, in every way,
    At this time, Guizhen was sixteen years old,
    Deqiang was eighteen and a little more,
    Seventeen-year-old Jinhua knew,
    Naturally giving her blessing from the core.
    The three of them were happy, but let's not mention,
    Let's just say on the eighth day of the fourth month, at noon,
    A guest came to Guizhen's house,
    Dark and fat, weighing two hundred jin, quite soon,
    The guest struck a match, about to light a cigarette,
    He Guizhen came to pour tea, to present,
    His eyes kept wandering over the girl,
    He looked at Guizhen clear and cleanly, what was sent,
    He saw her two braids, thin and long,
    And a pair of eyes even more poignant,
    Black was black, white was white,
    Her jet-black eyes were crystal-like, upright,
    Her yellow face carried a hint of sorrow,
    Her slender figure was as green as a willow, oh how!
    He only cared about how good Guizhen looked,
    The match burned his hand, "ouch, ouch," he hummed and crooked.
    Guizhen quickly dodged away,
    Her cheeks flushed red to her ears, without delay,
    Her heart thumped and thumped,
    Praying, "Mother, protect your child from harm today!"
    In the evening, she was about to bring the stepmother water for washing her feet,
    When she heard them talking about Guizhen in the room, indiscreet,
    It was her own father and stepmother arguing,
    Little Guizhen listened carefully outside the gloom,
    She heard her father say, "Guizhen is only sixteen this year,
    How can she marry an old man of forty-eight, I fear?
    Thinking of her mother's unclosed eyes before death,
    Always worrying about little Guizhen, my dear."
    The stepmother said, "Look at you, a stubborn old fool,
    Living in the world without seeing, feeling so cool,
    The man is giving two hundred silver dollars, such a stash,
    And a pair of gold and silver bracelets, with such a dash,
    Two bolts of silk and satin each,
    And the style of the clothes will be fashionable, to attach,
    Besides, he is a big businessman,
    Never worrying about food and dress, no attack,
    Where can you find such a son-in-law?
    If you don't agree, I will, that's a fact."
    The father sighed and didn't utter a sound,
    Guizhen outside the door was frightened and unbound,
    She hurried to find Zhang Deqiang,
    Telling him in a few words, tears all around,
    Jinhua comforted her from the side,
    "Your father will definitely not decide."
    Deqiang said, "Don't be sad, be at peace,
    We'll think of a plan when things are settled with ease."
    He came to see her on the eighth, and on the eleventh he gave the betrothal gifts,
    He was going to come to lift her, on the middle of the month, with swifts.
    The three of them devised a plan together,
    Jinhua said, "Listen to my idea, consider:
    I met a god-sister when selling junk,
    She went far away last winter, her trunk.
    A few days ago, she sent me a message,
    Saying she is making a living independently in Zhangjiakou, to encourage,
    She said she is having a good time,
    Wanting me to play with her for a few springs, so forage,
    Why don't we go and take refuge with her?
    Let's escape from this pit of sin, discourage! "
    Zhang Deqiang quickly said, "Good, good, good,"
    Guizhen said, "This is not understood,
    There are three of us, three mouths to feed,
    Where will she get so much money to provide our need?!"
    Deqiang said, "Guizhen, sister, don't be afraid,
    We'll all go out to work and make our own way, persuade,
    We are all young and able to work,
    We are not lazy people who shirk!"
    The three of them made a plan and discussed it well,
    Agreeing to escape on the night of the thirteenth, tell,
    Guizhen was secretly planning in her heart every day,
    Always wanting to steal some travel expenses to take away,
    But the hateful stepmother kept a close watch,
    There was no opportunity to steal, no sway,
    In the blink of an eye, the thirteenth day arrived,
    The sun set in the west, the sky grew alive,
    Guizhen's father was hunched over the table, settling accounts,
    The abacus beads clacked and bounced,
    Silver dollars filled half the drawer,
    Guizhen kept staring with her eyes, for sure,
    Really hoping to get the silver money in her hand,
    Really hoping her father would leave for a short strand,
    Guizhen was very anxious in her heart,
    Like an ant on a hot pot, unable to depart.
    Suddenly, her father got up to relieve himself,
    Guizhen quickly grabbed two handfuls of silver coins and hid them on herself,
    Turning around and running out the door,
    Like a wisp of smoke, she ran to the station to lend herself,
    In the blink of an eye, she arrived at the station,
    Jinhua and Deqiang welcomed her with elation,
    The three of them cried and laughed,
    Huddled together under the wall's foundation,
    Guizhen said, "Why hasn't the train left yet?
    Only when I get to Zhangjiakou will I set my mind, and never get regret."
    Deqiang said, "I'll pull a rickshaw in Zhangjiakou,
    To earn silver to support you, a stout vow."
    Guizhen said, "I'll do needlework for people,
    Who needs you to support us, anyhow!"
    Jinhua said, "When I find my god-sister in Zhangjiakou,
    I'll arrange for the two of you to get married, avow."
    Guizhen's face turned flushed,
    Grabbing her braid, she threatened to scold and how.
    The three sisters were talking and laughing, getting excited,
    Suddenly, someone walked over, united,
    Grabbing Guizhen by the back of her collar,
    Scaring the three of them, losing their power, to holler,
    To know who this person is,
    Listen to the next episode, to be clear,
            Second Episode: Begging for Food
    Speaking of the three escaping at the station,
    Talking and laughing, getting excited with temptation,
    Suddenly, someone came from behind,
    Grabbing Guizhen by the back of her collar, defined,
    This person dragged Guizhen back home,
    It was her own father who dragged Guizhen, prone.
    He came back from relieving himself and saw the money was missing,
    Calling for Guizhen, but she wasn't answering, hissing,
    Someone saw Guizhen running towards the station,
    So he went to the station to drag her back, addressing.
    The stepmother gnashed her teeth when she saw Guizhen,
    Like a tigress about to devour her in a den,
    Immediately locking her in a small room,
    Beating Guizhen until she couldn't even make a coon.
    On the fifteenth, they forced her into the sedan chair,
    Going through the marriage ceremony in a slipshod manner, rare.
    This black brute's name was Sun Youfu,
    A businessman who trafficked in opium, I swear,
    He had two wives,
    Neither of them could bear a hair,
    He Guizhen was to be the third junior wife,
    That black brute was three years older than Guizhen's father, I dare.
    Little Guizhen was born with a stubborn nature,
    Accepting beatings and scoldings, but refusing to share a bed with the brute, to nurture,
    The black brute had no choice but to lock up Guizhen,
    Not allowing anyone to bring her food to eat, for sure.
    In the middle of the night, when everyone was asleep,
    Guizhen grew more and more heartbroken, weep,
    Crying out, "Mother, you died too early, alas,"
    Crying out, "Father, you are too heartless, I pass,"
    Crying out, "Guizhen, I am so miserable, I fear,"
    Crying out, "Stepmother, you have the heart of a wolf, so clear,"
    Really hoping to escape from the wolf's den,
    Who knew she would fall into the tiger's lair again, so drear.
    The more she thought, the more miserable she became,
    Biting her teeth and hardening her heart with flame,
    As the saying goes, "people live to be a hundred years old and still die,"
    Better to die early and find peace, so why?
    Thinking back and forth, there was no way out,
    Untying the waistband rope, about,
    Tying one end to the bed frame,
    Tying the other end tightly around her neck, defame,
    Clenching her teeth and kicking her feet,
    The pain in her neck pierced her to meet,
    Suddenly she couldn't breathe,
    Her eyes widened, and she sank into a dizzy wreath.
    Just when she thought she was dead,
    Who knew she would open her eyes again, hazy and misled,
    Guizhen opened her eyes and looked around,
    She was lying on a bed in the hospital, bound,
    She felt sore all over and her neck hurt,
    She sighed and shed tears, down to the ground,
    From then on, Guizhen came back to life,
    And returned to the black brute's tiger lair, rife.
    The black brute was afraid of forcing her to death,
    So he slowly tortured little Guizhen, breath,
    Getting up in the middle of the night and sleeping late,
    She could never finish her work, abate,
    Guizhen secretly planned in her heart,
    Finding a way to escape from this tiger's lair, impart.
    The days were long and the years were short,
    In the blink of an eye, three months had passed, exhort,
    As the saying goes, "things take time for hearts to slow down,"
    It wasn't as strict as when she first entered the town,
    One night, the black brute got drunk,
    And the two wives also went out, drunk,
    He Guizhen stole the black brute's keys,
    Stealing twenty silver dollars, with degrees,
    Stealing two or three sets of clothes,
    Hurriedly escaping from the tiger's lair, please,
    The night in July was beautiful,
    The moon on the fifteenth was particularly gleeful,
    Shining on little Guizhen's solitary figure,
    Shining on little Guizhen, lonely and trigger,
    Shining on little Guizhen running so fast,
    Her feet flew without rest, at last,
    By dawn, she had run seventy-some li,
    On the third day, she boarded the train to her destiny.
    I won't go into detail about crossing provinces and counties,
    Five days later, she arrived in the great city of Zhangjiakou, how bounty,
    Staying in a small inn, she inquired everywhere,
    No one knew where Zhang Jinhua was, allow,
    Someone advised her to post an announcement,
    But she was afraid it would spread and alarm her family, endow.
    Staying in Zhangjiakou for more than a month,
    She spent all her money and felt the brunt,
    Having no choice, she sold her clothes,
    And in a few days, she spent it all, such stunts,
    Wanting to find a job,
    No one dared to hire this stranger, in fronts,
    The inn didn't let her stay because she had no money,
    So she had to find shelter under the eaves, oh honey.
    For two days, she had no money to eat,
    She was so hungry that her eyes blurred and her stomach ached, meet,
    Wanting to go out and beg for food,
    She really had no face to see people, with deceit,
    Wanting to refuse to beg for food,
    Her stomach was protesting, to greet,
    Little Guizhen walked back and forth on the street,
    Too embarrassed to ask people with her treat,
    Her stomach was too hungry to bear it,
    So she had to beg for food to pass the day, replete.
    One day, she was begging on the street,
    Suddenly, someone came towards her, to meet,
    Guizhen lowered her head, about to dodge,
    When she heard that person call out Guizhen, such footage,
    Pulling Guizhen into her arms,
    Scaring Guizhen, dropping her alms,
    To know if it is a blessing or a curse,
    Listen to the next episode, with immerse.
                               (End of Second Episode, to be continued)

    烟花女儿翻身记
    献给妇女生产教养院的姐妹们
    辛大明  
    第一回逃婚
    第二回  乞食
    第三回  逼债
    第四回  强奸
    第五回  落水
    第六回  解放
    第七回  团圆
            序言
    （一）都说烟花女儿贱，
    挤眉弄眼把人骗，
    人活脸来树活皮，
    请问谁人心情愿？
    （二）都说烟花女儿脏，
    十有九个长毒疮，
    全是人生父母养，
    请问谁人想这样？
    （三）只恨蒋介石国民党，
    安下天罗与地网，
    越是穷人越难活，
    良家女儿逼成娼。
    （四）毛主席来共产党，
    人民政府好主张，
    旧的制度推翻了，
    烟花女儿见太阳。
    诸位先生，诸位同志，刚才我唱的这首歌谣，原本是在石家庄城曾经红过一个时候的烟花女儿，“欢乐堂”一等妓女冬梅花，在她解放以后写的，在好些报纸上都登过，她怎么会写出这样的歌谣出来呢？提起这事，却有一段酸甜苦辣、喜怒哀乐的故事，请诸位雅座，听我慢慢的唱来：
            第一回  逃婚
    诸位雅座莫高声，
    听我唱段真事情，
    德州府有个黄花女，
    她姓何名叫何桂贞，
    她八岁上死了亲生母，
    九岁上有了后母亲，
    后母娘生来脾气暴燥，
    她亲爹又是个软耳根，
    她父亲开小杂货铺，只盘算怎么样赚钱，
    后母娘说什么他都信以为真，
    挨打挨骂就成了家常便饭，
    苦只苦早死了亲娘的何桂贞，
    全身的皮肉没有一天好，
    过年过节也没有见她喜笑过一声。
    对门有个闺女叫张金花，
    她俩从来就相亲，
    金花有个哥哥叫张德强，
    她和金花是一娘所生，
    她兄妹俩原本生长在农村，
    亲父母是租种土地的庄户人，
    只因是年荒天旱交不了租与债，
    才逼得家破人亡离乡又背井，
    金花兄妹十二岁死父十三岁丧母，
    全依靠叔叔过光阴，
    叔叔家在小市场卖破烂，
    也是把金花兄妹不当人。
    金花与桂贞到一块就相互把苦诉，
    张德强一旁也同情，
    三个人越来越亲热，
    常言说“同病相怜”就分外相亲。
    有一天桂贞给后母娘端茶喝，
    后母娘嫌她慢了把气生，
    一拳头打在了桂贞胳膊上，
    茶杯打落在地埃尘，
    后母娘一见更发了火，
    用皮鞭抽的桂贞全身青，
    打的皮烂肉飞还不算，
    还不叫桂贞把饭吞，
    就这样后母娘还平不了气，
    床底下取出了绳一根，
    将桂贞绑在了槐树上，
    要她一夜睡不成。
    三更里翻墙进来了张德强，
    悄悄解开树上的绳，
    金花送来了热水和大饼，
    桂贞那能往下吞，
    三个人抱在一团把泪落，
    还不敢说话惊动人，
    眼看五更鸡叫天快亮，
    还只得照样绑好各离分，
    从此张德强与桂贞俩相好，
    受苦人爱的是受苦人，
    二人对天发誓“白头到老”，
    火烧水淹也不离分，
    这时桂贞十六岁，
    德强十八有余零，
    十七岁的金花知道了，
    自然是双手来赞成。
    她们三人欢乐且不表，
    单说在四月初八的晌午时分，
    桂贞家来了一个客，
    又黑又胖个儿足有二百斤，
    这客人划燃了火柴正要把烟吸，
    来了端茶送水的何桂贞，
    他两眼不住在这女孩身上溜，
    他把桂贞看了个清，
    他见她两根辫子细又长，
    一对眼睛更动人，
    黑是黑来白是白，
    乌黑的眼珠水晶晶，
    黄黄的脸蛋儿带三分愁，
    细长的身材杨柳青，
    他只顾看桂贞长得好，
    洋火烧手“哎哟哟”烧得他直哼哼。
    桂贞一见忙躲开，
    脸蛋儿红到了耳朵根，
    心口儿不住咚咚跳，
    直祷告“亲娘呀保佑孩儿不要出事情！”
    到晚上她正给后母娘去送洗脚水，
    只听房里在议论桂贞，
    是亲爹和后母在争吵，
    小桂贞在门外听的真，
    只听亲爹说：“桂贞今年十六岁，
    怎能嫁给四十八岁的年老人，
    想起她妈临死瞑不了目，
    一直惦记着小桂贞。”
    后娘说：“看你这死心眼的老顽固，
    枉活在人世上没有长眼睛，
    人家给大头银元二百块，
    这镏子镯子一对金来一对银，
    绸子缎子每样两匹，
    衣服的样式还要时兴，
    再说人家是大买卖主，
    穿吃二字不耽心，
    这样的女婿那里找，
    你不应承我要应承。”
    亲爹叹了口气没哼声，
    桂贞门外吓掉了魂，
    急忙找见了张德强，
    三言两语泪纷纷，
    金花一旁来安慰，
    “你亲爹一定不答应。”
    德强说：“不要难过安安心，
    事情说定了再把主意生。”
    初八看人十一就下了聘礼，
    月半十五就要来抬人。
    三人一块儿把计定，
    金花说：“我有个主意你们听，
    卖破烂我认识了个干姐姐，
    去年冬天出了远门。
    前几天她给我捎来了口信，
    说她在张家口独立谋生，
    她说她日月光景过得好，
    要我到她那里耍上几春，
    到不如咱们投奔到她那里去，
    咱们逃出这陷人坑，
    张德强忙说：“好好好”，
    桂贞说：“这事可不行，
    咱们三人三张嘴，
    她那有许多银钱来供养咱们？！”
    德强说：“桂贞妹妹你不要害怕，
    咱们都出去做工自己谋营生，
    咱们都年轻能干活，
    又不是那好吃懒做人！”
    三人定计商量好，
    约定十三的夜晚逃出门。
    桂贞天天心里暗盘算，
    总想偷些路费带在身，
    可恨后母娘管得紧，
    没有时机总偷不成，
    转眼到了十三日，
    日落西山天黄昏，
    桂贞爹伏在桌上清算账目，
    算盘子儿拨的叮当叮，
    洋钱装满了半抽屉，
    桂贞不住的用眼睛盯，
    实指望银子钱拿到手，
    实指望她爹离开一阵，
    桂贞心里好着急，
    好像那热锅上的蚂蚁不安心。
    突然间她爹起来去解手，
    桂贞忙抓了两把洋钱藏在身，
    扭身出门拔腿就跑，
    一股烟似的就朝那车站上投奔，
    转眼之间来到了车站上，
    金花德强把他迎，
    三个人又是哭来又是笑，
    一块儿躲在了土墙根，
    桂贞说：“怎么火车还不开？
    到了张家口我才放下心。”
    德强说：“到张家口我去拉排子车，
    挣下银钱供养你们”。
    桂贞说：“我去给人家做针线活，
    谁要你来供养我们！”
    金花说：“到张家口找着了我干姐姐，
    我安排得你们俩个结了婚”。
    说得桂贞脸发臊，
    抓住那辫子要打人。
    三姐妹说说笑笑正上劲，
    突然走过来一个人，
    一把抓住了桂贞的后衣领，
    吓得三人掉了魂，
    要知这人是哪一个，
    且听下回说分明。
            第二回  乞食
    却说三人逃在了车站上，
    说说笑笑正上劲，
    突然背后来了个人，
    抓住了桂贞后衣领，
    这人将桂贞抓回了家，
    抓桂贞的是她的亲父亲。
    他解手回来见钱少了，
    呼叫桂贞也不见应声，
    有人见桂贞朝车站跑，
    他才到车站抓回了人。
    后母娘一见桂贞直咬牙，
    活像只母老虎要把人吞，
    登时关在了小房子内，
    直打得桂贞哭不成声。
    十五那天生拉活扯上了轿，
    马马虎虎过了亲。
    这黑金刚名字就叫孙有福，
    是一个贩卖白面大烟的生意人，
    老婆娶了有两个，
    都是不把孩儿生，
    何桂贞过来算第三房小，
    那黑金刚比桂贞的父亲还大三春。
    小桂贞生来性子硬，
    认打认骂也不跟金刚同床来共枕，
    黑金刚无奈何关起了桂贞女，
    不叫人送饭给她吞。
    半夜三更人睡定，
    桂贞越想越伤心，
    哭了声娘呀你死得早，
    哭了声爹呀你太狠心，
    哭了声桂贞我好命苦，
    哭了声后娘狼狗心，
    实只望逃出狗狼窝，
    谁知又落到了虎豹坑。
    越思越想越凄惨，
    牙根一咬横了心，
    常言说“人活百岁也是死”，
    不如早死早安身。
    思前想后没有出路，
    解下裤腰带绳一根，
    一头拴在了床架上，
    一头把脖子套了个紧，
    牙根咬紧双脚一蹬，
    脖子疼痛得钻人心，
    一阵闭的出不来气，
    两眼一瞪昏沉沉。
    只说是死了就算了，
    谁知到迷迷糊糊又睁开了眼睛，
    桂贞睁开眼四面张望，
    原来在医院的床上安了身，
    只觉得混身酸疼脖子疼，
    长叹了一声颗颗珠泪往下倾，
    从此桂贞又活了过来，
    又回到了黑金刚那虎豹坑。
    黑金刚怕逼的紧了出人命，
    只好慢慢的生法折磨小桂贞，
    起半夜来睡五更，
    活儿总是做不清，
    桂贞心中暗盘算，
    想法要逃出这虎豹坑。
    日子长来岁月短，
    转眼过了三月整，
    常言说“事情长了人心慢”，
    也不像乍进门那样管的紧，
    有一夜黑金刚吃醉了酒，
    两个老婆也出了门，
    何桂贞偷来了黑金刚的一串钥匙，
    二十块洋钱偷在身，
    衣服偷了两三套，
    急忙逃出了虎豹坑，
    七月里的夜晚好天气，
    十五的月儿分外明，
    照见了小桂贞单身独影，
    照见了小桂贞孤苦零仃，
    照见了小桂贞跑得好快，
    两脚如飞没有消停，
    到天明直跑了七十几里，
    到第三天才搭上了火车奔前程。
    穿州过县我不细表，
    五天后来到张家口这座大城，
    住在了小里店四处打听，
    谁也不知道张金花在那里安身？
    有人劝她登上个报，
    她又怕传出去惊动了家里的人。
    在张家口呆了一月多，
    银钱花了个干干净，
    无奈何只好卖衣服，
    不几天又花了个干干净，
    有心找上个事情做，
    谁也不敢要这外乡人，
    店里见她无钱也就不让住，
    她只好在房屋底下去安身。
    有两天钱花光了没有吃饭，
    只饿得眼花肚子痛，
    有心出去讨的吃，
    实在是无脸去见人，
    有心不去讨的吃，
    肚子饿得不答应，
    小桂贞在街上来回走走，
    总不好意思伸手哀求人，
    肚子饿的实在受不了，
    只好讨吃过光阴。
    有一天讨吃街上走，
    迎面突然来了一个人，
    桂贞低头正要躲闪，
    只见那人开口就叫桂贞，
    一把把桂贞抱在了怀，
    只吓得桂贞掉了魂，
    要知是祸还是福，
    且听下回说分明。
                               （第二回完，下回继续）
