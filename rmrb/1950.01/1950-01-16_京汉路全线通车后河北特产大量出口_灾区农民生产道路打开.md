    Hebei Specialty Products Exported in Large Quantities After Full Opening of the Beijing-Hankou Railway
    Production Road Opened for Farmers in Disaster Areas

    [By Our Own Correspondent] The full opening of the Beijing-Hankou Railway has created a new path for connecting trade between South China, North China, and the Northeast, and for supporting the production and famine relief efforts of farmers in the vast disaster areas of Hebei Province. In the short ten days since its official opening on New Year's Day, great changes have already occurred in north-south transportation. From New Year's Day to January 8th, in just eight days, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's warehouse and transportation company transported large quantities of sideline products from disaster-stricken farmers to the Northwest and Northeast via the railway: a total of 2,600 tons of reed and hemp, and 14.5 million bolts of local cloth and Gaoyang cloth; in return, they exchanged for 24.4 million catties of grain. They also transferred 8.6 million catties of coal from the Jingxing Yangquan, Mentougou, and Kailuan coal mines. Including the material exchange situation after the opening of the Beijing-Shijiazhuang section, the Northwest Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative alone, from October of last year to January 10th of this year, has exported a total of 183,975 bolts of local cloth and exchanged for over 23 million catties of grain. These have greatly facilitated the export of specialty products and the import of grain for farmers in disaster areas. Due to the convenience of transportation, the Cotton, Yarn & Cloth Company and the Oil Company have also seen changes in the large-scale purchase and export of special crops. Farmers in Yuanshi County along the railway said, "Now that the Beijing-Hankou Railway is open, cotton has grown legs. From now on, no one will be willing to plant less cotton, even without government mobilization." The manager of the Coal and Iron Company summarized the characteristics after the opening of the Beijing-Hankou Railway as follows: "Baoding Station is busy in three ways: the trains are busy, the workers are busy, and the rural carts are busy." In Qingyuan County, a disaster area, more than 300 large and small carts transport grain to the provincial supply and marketing cooperative's warehouse every day. Farmer Li Gengshen from Zhangdeng Village said, "If the railway hadn't opened, the grain wouldn't have arrived so quickly and easily." The Coal and Iron Branch Company received an average of 270 tons of coal per day in December of last year. According to statistics for the first eight days of January this year, the average daily amount increased by 262 tons compared to December. With smoother transportation and reduced transportation costs, the prices of some materials in the Baoding market have begun to fall. For example, high-quality lump coal from Mentougou cost 7,000 yuan per hundred catties in late December, but it fell to 6,850 yuan in early January this year, and special raw coal dropped by 300 yuan per hundred catties. No less than two or three hundred farmers from disaster areas go to the Coal and Iron Company to purchase coal every day. The opening of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, which had been interrupted for twelve years, has opened new sources of wealth for the people. Once the Beijing-Hankou line is officially restored for freight transport, a new atmosphere will emerge in the exchange of materials between the north and the south.

### 京汉路全线通车后河北特产大量出口  灾区农民生产道路打开

    京汉路全线通车后河北特产大量出口
    灾区农民生产道路打开
    【本报讯】京汉铁路的全线通车，对沟通华南、华北、东北贸易，支援河北省广大灾区农民生产渡荒，开辟了新的道路。从元旦正式通车到现在仅短短十天，南北运输就起了很大变化。从元旦起到一月八日八天中，河北省供销总社货栈、运输公司通过铁路向西北、东北大量输送了灾区农民的副业产品：计苇麻两千六百吨，土布高阳布一千四百五十万匹；换回粮食二千四百四十万斤。从井陉阳泉、门头沟、开滦煤矿调剂回煤炭八百六十万斤。如果连起京石通车后的物资交流情况，仅河北省供销总社西北办事处，从去年十月到今年一月十日的统计，土布总输出就有十八万三千九百七十五匹，换回粮食二千三百多万斤。这些都极大的便利了灾区农民特产品的输出和粮食的输入。花纱布公司，油脂公司，由于交通条件的便利，特种作物的大量购入和输出也起了变化。沿路元氏县的农民说：“京汉路通了车，棉花长上了腿，往后不用说政府动员，谁也不肯少种棉。煤铁公司经理总结京汉路通车以后的特点时说：“保定车站有三忙，火车忙，工人忙，乡下大车忙。”只清苑县灾区农民每天就有三百余辆大车小车到省供销总社货栈运粮。张登村农民李更身说：“要不是铁路通车，粮食来的也不能这么快当。”煤铁支公司，去年十二月份每日平均来煤炭二百七十吨，今年一月份八天的统计，平均每天比十二月份增至二百六十二吨。交通的畅通，运输成本减低，保定市场部分物资价格趋降。如门头沟甲块煤，十二月下旬每百斤七千元，今年一月上旬降到六千八百五十元，特原煤每百斤落价三百元。灾区农民到煤铁公司购煤炭的每天不下二三百人。中断十二年之久的京汉路通车，给人民打开了新的富源。一旦京汉全线正式恢复货运，南北物资交流将会出现更新的气象。
