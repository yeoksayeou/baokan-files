    Many Private Enterprises in Northeast China Sign Labor-Management Collective Contracts
    Labor Disputes Significantly Reduced and Production Efficiency Rapidly Increased
    Workers' Legitimate Interests Guaranteed, Capitalists Gain Confidence in Developing Production
    Attention Should be Paid to Overcoming Capitalist Coercion of Workers and Certain Workers' Excessive Demands in Signing Contracts
    Some Capitalists' Unreasonable Actions in Shenyang After Signing Contracts Have Attracted Government Attention and Correction Measures are Underway
    [This newspaper reports] Since the National Trade Union Work Conference in August last year, the Labor Bureaus and Labor Sections of local people's governments in Northeast China, with the assistance of the Industry and Commerce Bureaus and local Federations of Industry and Commerce, have begun to formulate labor-management collective contracts by industry, in accordance with the spirit of the conference. As of now, in the private enterprises of Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Qiqihar, Andong, Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, Yingkou, Liaoyang, Dalian, Siping, Jilin, Xi'an, Jinzhou, Tonghua, Chengde and other cities, collective contracts have been signed in industries such as machinery and ironwork, knitting, cotton weaving, papermaking, sawmills, traditional Chinese medicine, shoemaking, matches, and pot-making. As a result of labor and management signing collective contracts, issues that frequently lead to disputes, such as hiring, firing, wages, working hours, labor protection, welfare, and labor discipline, have been resolved. This guarantees the legitimate interests of workers, allowing them to work diligently with peace of mind. Capitalists also have more confidence in developing production and actively expanding their businesses because the rights and obligations of both parties are clearly defined. Therefore, the output of factories in industries that have signed contracts in various regions has generally increased rapidly. Before signing the contract, the manager of the Heqing Iron Factory in Shenyang had concerns about the "expropriation of the expanded factory." Although he had an active management plan, he did not dare to implement it boldly. Workers also had low production efficiency and many defective products due to excessively long working hours and poor working conditions. After the city-wide collective contract was signed, the factory adjusted working hours, wages, and food supply standards reasonably in accordance with the contract. Both labor and management were very satisfied and actively engaged in production. Now, manufacturing a "steam cake" for a locomotive requires 0.4 fewer workers than before, and the production quality of the foundry department has also improved. In December of last year, in addition to hiring seven technicians and three apprentices, the capitalist also bought nine bungalows, preparing to expand the factory this spring. The factory is currently repairing ten existing lathes. In addition, Zhenji, Hongchang, Xindong, Xinglong and other iron factories have also hired workers and increased equipment. After the Hechang Paper Mill in Andong City signed the contract, its output in September exceeded the original production target (12 tons) by five tons. Workers received an extra bonus of 5 million yuan (Northeast currency, the same below), and the capitalist also earned a net profit of 550 million yuan due to the sudden increase in output, an increase of two times compared to the factory's net profit income in August. After the signing of the contract in the iron industry in Jiamusi City, the workers' production enthusiasm generally increased. In addition to guaranteeing the completion of the factory's production plan, the workers of Dadong and other iron factories also proposed to respect teachers and cherish apprentices, cherish tools, and save raw materials. Managers of Donghe and Xiangde Iron Factories also changed their ideas of relocating or stopping work. The manager of Yida Iron Factory used to eat and drink lavishly, and the factory was on the verge of ruin. After signing the contract, he actively thought about expanding production and went to Harbin to contract work. Other industries in various regions that have signed labor contracts have also shown a thriving atmosphere due to the joint efforts of labor and management in implementing the contract provisions and striving to develop production. However, the signing of labor contracts in various places was not smooth sailing and direct agreements were reached. Generally, the spirit of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' documents on signing labor-management collective contracts was followed, referring to the pioneering example of the Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry Collective Contract, and vigorously promoting and brewing the contracts among labor and management based on the specific circumstances of each industry in the locality. In the process of brewing, through continuous persuasion and education, some of the excessive demands of some labor parties and the bad tendencies of capitalists intending to coerce workers were corrected. For example, the capitalists in the iron industry in Harbin City vigorously promoted one-sided and ineffective capitalist contract drafts. In the process of ordering contracts in the timber industry in Siping City, it was found that the capitalists had more rights, fewer obligations, more demands for punishment of workers, and fewer rewards. Some workers in the iron industry in Jiamusi City and the cotton textile industry in Yingkou City mistakenly believed that signing contracts was simply about welfare, or that they were not free after signing contracts, and put forward some excessive demands. After education, they quickly realized the purpose of signing the contract. For the sake of long-term interests, they took the initiative to make concessions.
    According to the situation of signing and implementing labor-management collective contracts in Northeast China, the following issues are worth noting: 1. In the process of ordering contracts, most areas adopted the method of mobilizing and educating both labor and management to fully and democratically negotiate under the leadership of the labor bureau, with the cooperation of the trade union, the industry association, and the industry and commerce bureau. From brewing, discussion to signing, both sides repeatedly and carefully discussed the process through representatives and all employees and owners, so that both sides had a better understanding of the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and management through negotiation of each specific regulation. However, a few areas have deviated in ordering contracts. For example, the leadership of the shoe industry in Andong City to order contracts was "composed of five comrades from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Handicraft Trade Union," which made the trade union both work for the workers and for the capitalists, blurring the masses' understanding that the trade union is an organization representing the interests of workers. 2. In the implementation of the contract, some capitalists violated the contract, arbitrarily extending working hours and ignoring the interests of workers. Even dismissed workers for no reason. Xinghua Paper Mill in Andong extended working hours to 12 or 13 hours for no reason. The boss of Taixin Shoe Store in the city used the words "eat up the closed door" to scare workers to reduce wages, from 120 points to 80 points. A few private iron industrialists in Shenyang City also arbitrarily suppressed wages of workers after signing the contract. They even said: "If you don't want to do it because you think it's too little, then get out!" Dasheng Iron Factory has recently dismissed most workers for no reason. The above situation has attracted the attention of the Shenyang Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau, and has begun to correct it. Harbin City has also seen individual capitalists distorting the contract and abusing the right to dismiss workers.
    In order to understand the implementation situation in a timely manner and solve the problems that have occurred, the Jiamusi City Labor Section, the General Trade Union, and the Industry and Commerce Bureau took the initiative to convene a meeting of representatives of labor and management in the shoe industry to check the implementation of the contract. Both labor and management made reports at the meeting. According to the inspection results, both sides basically implemented it, especially the workers, who implemented it more thoroughly, thus promoting production. Workers made appropriate criticisms on the spot to some capitalists who had slightly deviated in their implementation. Finally, a representative of the Labor Section spoke, encouraging both parties to further implement the contract in order to achieve the goal of developing production and benefiting both labor and management.

    东北不少私营企业签订劳资集体合同
    劳资纠纷显著减少生产效率迅速提高
    工人正当利益得到保证资方发展生产有了信心
    签订合同中应注意克服资方对工人要胁和某些工人的过高要求
    签订合同后沈阳某些资方无理行动已引起政府注意着手纠正
    【本报讯】东北不少大中城市私营企业劳资双方已签订集体合同，劳资纠纷已显著减少，产量迅速提高。自去年八月间全国工会工作会议结束后，东北各地人民政府劳动局、劳动科、总工会即按照会议精神，在工商局协助下，与当地工商同业公会，开始以行业为单位订立劳资集体合同。截至目前，沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、齐齐哈尔、安东、佳木斯、牡丹江、营口、辽阳、旅大、四平、吉林、西安、锦州、通化、承德等市私营企业中，已订立集体合同的有机械铁工、针织、棉织、造纸、火锯、国药、鞋业、火柴、锅业等行业。由于劳资双方订立集体合同的结果，解决了一些经常容易发生纠纷的如雇佣、解雇、工资、工时、劳保福利及劳动纪律等问题。这样使工人的正当利益获得保证，安心努力生产；资方也因双方权利、义务有了明确规定，对发展生产更有了信心，积极扩大营业。因此，在各地已签订合同的行业厂家，一般的产量已迅速提高。沈阳合兴铁工厂经理在未签订合同前，思想上存有“工厂扩大被没收”的顾虑，自己虽有积极经营计划，但不敢大胆实现；工人也因每日生产时间过长，劳动条件不好，故生产效率低，废品很多。全市集体合同签订后，该厂即按照合同合理调整了工时、工资、伙食供给标准等，劳资双方都很满意，积极生产。现在制造一个机车用的“汽饼子”，较前省工○·四个，翻砂部门生产质量也较前提高。在去年十二月份，资方除增雇七名技工、三名学徒外，并买到九间平房，准备今春扩大工厂。现该厂正修整旧存十台车床。此外振记、宏昌、新东、兴隆等铁工厂，也纷纷添雇工人，增加设备。安东市和昌造纸厂签订合同后，九月份产量即超过原定生产量（十二吨）五吨。工人获得超额奖金五百万元（东北币，下同），资方也因产量突增，得纯利五亿五千万元，较八月份该厂纯利收入增加两倍。佳木斯市铁工业在签订合同后，工友生产情绪普遍提高。大东等铁工厂工友除提出保证完成厂方生产计划外，并要做到尊师爱徒，爱护工具，节省原料。东和、祥德铁厂经理也改变了要迁厂、停工等想法。义大铁厂经理过去大吃大喝，眼看工厂要荒。订合同后积极想法扩大生产，到哈尔滨去包活。其他各地已签订劳资合同的行业，也因劳资双方执行了合同规约，努力发展生产，呈现欣欣向荣气象。但各地在签订劳资合同时，并非一帆风顺，直接达成协议。一般都根据全总所颁布的关于签订劳资集体合同文件的精神，参照北京国药业集体合同的先行范例，结合当地各行业具体情况，大力在劳资双方宣传酝酿。在酝酿中，经过不断说服教育，纠正了某些劳方的过高要求，及资方意图挟此要胁工人的不良倾向。如哈尔滨市铁工业资方曾把片面的不生效的资方合同草案大肆吹嘘。四平市木工业在订合同中，发现资方要求权利多、义务少，要求对工人处分多，奖励少的偏向。佳木斯市铁工业，营口棉织业在签订合同时，有的工人误认订合同是单纯搞福利，或认为订了合同不自由，而提出了某些过高要求。经过教育后，很快便认清了订合同的目的。为了长远利益，主动的做了让步。
    根据东北各地签订和执行劳资集体合同的情形看来，有如下问题值得注意：一、订立合同过程中大部地区采取了在劳动局领导下，由工会、同业公会及工商局配合，动员教育劳资双方充分民主协商的办法。从酝酿、讨论到签订，都经过了双方代表及全体职工、业主反复周密讨论的过程，使双方通过每件具体条例的协商，对发展生产，劳资两利的政策有了更进一步的认识。但少数地区在订立合同时发生偏向。如安东市鞋业领导订立合同的是“由市总工会和手工业工会五个同志组成”，这样使工会既作工人工作，又作资本家的工作，模糊了群众对工会是代表工人利益的组织的认识。二、在执行合同中有的资方违反合同，任意延长工时，忽视工人利益。甚至无理解雇工人。安东兴华造纸厂无故延长工时至十二、三小时。该市太新鞋店老板用“吃光了关门”的话来吓唬工人降低工资，由一百二十分降到八十分。沈阳市也有少数私营铁工业主在签订合同后任意压抵工人工资现象。甚至声言：“你嫌少不愿干就拉倒！”大生铁工厂近来将大部工人无理解雇。上述情况已引起沈市府工商局的注意，并已着手纠正。哈尔滨市也出现个别资方歪曲合同滥用解雇权解雇工人的事实。
    为了及时了解执行情况及解决所发生的问题，佳木斯市劳动科、总工会、工商局曾主动地召开了皮鞋业劳资双方代表会，检查执行合同的情形。劳资双方在会上都作了报告。根据检查结果，双方基本上都执行了，特别是工人执行的更为彻底，因此推动了生产。对某些执行稍有偏差的资方，工人当场提出了适当批评。最后由劳动科代表发言，勉励双方进一步贯彻执行合同，以达到发展生产劳资两利目的。
