    Taken Over by Beijing Municipal Government Personnel

    [Beijing News] The Beijing Public Senior Obstetrics Vocational School and Public Obstetrics Hospital, due to financial difficulties and inability to continue operations, had their board of directors submit a request to the Beijing Municipal People's Government on November 19th of last year to take over. In order to further strengthen maternal and child health care work in the city, the Municipal Government deemed it necessary to continue running the school and the hospital, and therefore issued an order on December 14th of last year to the Health Bureau in conjunction with the Education Bureau to send personnel to take over. The takeover and inventory work has now been completed, and it has been decided that from January 3rd of this year, they will be renamed Beijing Municipal Obstetrics School and Beijing Municipal First Maternity Hospital.

    公益助产学校等两单位
    京市府派员接管
    【北京讯】本市公益高级助产职业学校及公益产科医院，因经费困难无法继续维持，该校、院董事会于去年十一月十九日曾呈请北京市人民政府要求接管。市府为进一步加强本市妇婴保健工作，认为有继续开办该校及该院之必要，遂于去年十二月十四日令卫生局会同教育局派员接管。现在接管清点工作已经完成，决定自本年一月三日起更名为北京市立助产学校及北京市立第一产科学院。
