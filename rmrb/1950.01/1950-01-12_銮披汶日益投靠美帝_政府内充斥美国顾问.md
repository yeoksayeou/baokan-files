Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th – According to a special article published in Singapore's Nanyang Siang Pau on December 9th of last year, the Phibun group of Thailand, which cooperated with Japanese imperialism during the war, has recently leaned increasingly towards the embrace of US imperialism. The Thai government has recently hired several more Americans as advisors, important among whom are Mr. Goer, advisor to the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Scott, advisor to the Ministry of Commerce, and Mr. Biton, the behind-the-scenes advisor who influences Thailand's diplomacy. The article also stated that, given Thailand's rich resources, especially its abundant rice and grain, and given that Phibun, who played a role in the Japanese "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" during the war, was rescued by the United States and supported in regaining power, the United States has chosen Thailand and taken a liking to Phibun, considering him a very reliable "anti-communist and anti-Soviet vanguard."

The article recalled: Phibun, disregarding the opposition of the Thai people, issued a statement to Associated Press reporter Abergett on September 10th of last year, welcoming the entry of US and British troops into Siam to "deal with the communists." Recently, the English-language Bangkok Post, run by Americans, ran the headline: "Thailand Will Automatically Close Its Embassy in Moscow by the End of This Year (i.e., 1949)." According to a report in Bangkok's Quanmin Daily on November 29th of last year, although Thai Foreign Minister Nai Pote Sarasin denied that Thailand had decided to close its embassy in the Soviet Union, the Thai Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Phra Bahiddha Nukara, was summoned back to the country at the end of November last year, and the affairs of the Thai Embassy in the Soviet Union are now being handled by Nai Rōng Phonbun. At the same time, the US State Department decided to convene a conference of US diplomatic representatives to the Far East in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, in mid-February. According to Thai Foreign Minister Nai Pote Sarasin, the United States obtained Thailand's consent for the conference to be held in Bangkok.

### 銮披汶日益投靠美帝  政府内充斥美国顾问

    銮披汶日益投靠美帝
    政府内充斥美国顾问
    【新华社北京十日电】据新加坡南侨日报去年十二月九日刊载的专文称，战时曾与日本帝国主义合作的泰国銮披汶集团，最近日益倒向美帝国主义的怀抱。泰国政府近已增聘美人若干人为顾问，其中重要者有财政部顾问顾尔，商业部顾问斯各脱及左右泰国外交的幕后顾问碧顿。该文又称，由于泰国物产丰富，尤其是米粮充足，而战时曾在日寇“大东亚共荣圈”中充任配角的銮披汶，又是美国拯救过来并支持其重夺政权的，因此美国便选择了泰国，看中了銮披汶，认为他是十分可靠的“反共反苏先锋”。
    该文回溯称：銮披汶不顾泰国人民的反对，曾于去年九月十日向合众社记者阿伯格特发表欢迎美英军队开入暹罗以“对付共产党”的声明。最近美国人经营的英文曼谷邮报的大字标题说：“泰国将在今年（按即一九四九年）底自动关闭在莫斯科的公使馆”。据曼谷全民报去年十一月二十九日消息，泰外长乃朴·沙拉信虽然否认泰国决定封闭驻苏公使馆，但泰国驻苏公使伯希他·他奴功已于去年十一月底奉召返国，泰国驻苏公使馆的馆务现由乃荣·蓬汶代理。而与此同时，美国务院则决定于二月中旬在泰国首都曼谷，召开美国驻远东各国的外交代表会议。这个会议之在曼谷召开，据泰外长乃朴·沙拉信承认，美国是征得泰国的同意的。
