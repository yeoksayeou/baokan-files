    [Report from this newspaper] The Taiyuan branch of the North China Hog Bristle Specialized Company summarized its work in December of last year. Because the company shifted from relying solely on local firms and merchants for purchases to largely purchasing through rural cooperatives, directly connecting with the vast number of farmers, the work made great progress. In total, the company purchased over 7,960 catties of hog bristles, over 3,920 catties of coarse bristles, and over 1,630 catties of pig hair in December. Due to the company's active purchases, the importance of hog bristles has been greatly emphasized by the broad masses. It is understood that the phenomenon of arbitrarily discarding hog bristles has decreased. In the work, cadres also carried out business studies. In order to improve the common sense of identifying the quality of hog bristles, the cadres organized study groups in December during actual purchasing, studied quality identification, and exchanged experiences with each other. This practical education improved the general work skills and gradually made the technology meet the requirements of the work.

    太原猪鬃公司通过合作社收购猪鬃
    组织学习提高了鉴别技术
    【本报讯】华北猪鬃专业公司太原支公司总结去年十二月份工作。由于该公司由已往单纯依靠当地行栈、商贩收购，进到大部通过农村合作社收购，与广大农民直接发生联系，使工作获得很大进展。总计该公司十二月共收购猪鬃七千九百六十余斤，毛鬃三千九百二十余斤，猪毛一千六百三十余斤。由于该公司的积极收购，大大的启发了广大群众对于猪鬃的重视，据了解，任意遗弃猪鬃的现象，已经减少。在工作中，干部同时进行了业务学习。以便提高鉴别猪鬃品质的常识，故十二月份在实际收购中，干部组织了学习小组，学习鉴别质量，相互交流经验。这种实际教育提高了一般的工作技术，逐渐使技术符合工作的要求。
