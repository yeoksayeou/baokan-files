Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: TASS Moscow reports: The regulations for the election of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR have been approved and promulgated by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Moscow newspapers have published editorials expounding the contents of these election regulations and explaining the principles of the Soviet election system.

    The Pravda editorial stated: Every chapter and article of the regulations for the election of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR aims to ensure that the people can freely express their will. According to the Soviet Constitution and in accordance with the election regulations, voters elect representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on the basis of universal, equal, and direct suffrage through secret ballot. Every Soviet citizen who has reached the age of eighteen, with the exception of those suffering from mental illness and those deprived of voting rights by court judgment, regardless of their race, nationality, gender, religious belief, education level, length of residence, social origin, property status, and past activities, has the right to participate in the election of representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Any Soviet citizen who has reached the age of twenty-three may be elected as a representative to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Every Soviet citizen is guaranteed all conditions to fully exercise their civic duty and sacred right to participate in elections.

    Pravda emphasized: The Soviet election system provides all citizens of our great country with every opportunity to actively participate in the election campaign for the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. This truly democratic election system is only possible in a socialist country. Comrade Stalin, the leader of all nationalities, in his historic speech to the voters of the Stalin District of Moscow on December 11, 1937, vividly demonstrated the fundamental differences between Soviet elections and elections in capitalist countries. Comrade Stalin said: "In our country, there are no capitalists, no landlords, and therefore no oppression of the proletariat by the propertied classes. In our country, elections are conducted in an atmosphere of cooperation between workers, peasants, and intellectuals, in an atmosphere of mutual trust, and, it can be said, in an atmosphere of mutual friendship. Because we have no capitalists, no landlords, no exploitation, there is fundamentally no one who can oppress the people or distort public opinion."

    Pravda pointed out: The election of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR is a great political event in the life of all Soviet people. The Party, the Soviets, and all mass organizations must carry out large-scale political education work, explain the significance of the elections, and vividly demonstrate to all voters the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, as well as the great victories our country has achieved in all aspects of communist construction under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin. The Party and other mass organizations must engage in extensive activities to ensure that the people, especially those participating in elections for the first time, understand Soviet election law. All forms of written and oral propaganda and mobilization must be utilized, and the vast army of propagandists and agitators must be used to accomplish this task.

    真正民主的选举制度
    只有在社会主义国家才有可能
    真理报论苏联最高苏维埃选举条例
    【新华社北京十三日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃选举条例业经苏联最高苏维埃主席团批准公布。莫斯科各报均发表社论，阐述这一选举条例的内容，并说明苏联选举制度的原则。
    真理报社论称：苏联最高苏维埃选举条例的每一章和每一条的目的，都在于确保人民可以自由地表示他们的意志。根据苏联宪法及遵照选举条例，选民在普遍的、平等的和直接的选举基础上，以秘密投票方式选出苏联最高苏维埃代表。凡年满十八岁的苏联公民，除患精神病及被法庭判决褫夺选举权者外，不论其人种、民族、性别、宗教信仰、教育程度、居住期限、社会出身、财产状况以及过去活动如何，均有权参加苏联最高苏维埃代表的选举。凡年满二十三岁的苏联公民，均得被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表。每一个苏联公民均被保证享有一切条件，以便充分行使其参加选举的公民义务和神圣权利。
    真理报着重指出：苏维埃选举制度，为我们伟大国家的全体公民提供了积极参加苏联最高苏维埃选举运动的一切机会。这种真正民主的选举制度，只有在社会主义国家才有可能。各族人民领袖斯大林同志在一九三七年十二月十一日向莫斯科斯大林区的选民所发表的历史性演说中，曾生动地显示了苏联的选举和资本主义国家的选举有着根本的区别。斯大林同志说：“在我国，没有资本家，没有地主，因而也就没有有产阶级对无产阶级的压迫。在我国，选举是在工人、农民和知识分子合作的气氛中、在互相信任的气氛中、也可以说是在相互友好的气氛中进行的。因为我们没有资本家，没有地主，没有剥削，所以根本就没有任何人能够压迫人民，歪曲民意。”
    真理报指出：苏联最高苏维埃选举，是全苏联人民生活中的伟大政治事件。党、苏维埃和一切群众组织必须进行大规模的政治教育工作，说明选举的意义，并生动地向一切选民显示社会主义制度较资本主义制度的优越性，以及在列宁斯大林党的领导下我国在共产主义建设的各方面所获得的伟大胜利。党和其他的群众组织必须从事广泛的活动，使得人民、特别是初次参加选举的选民，了解苏联选举法。必须利用一切文字和口头的宣传鼓动方法，并利用全体宣传工作者和鼓动工作者大军，来完成这一任务。
