    Native Produce Company Actively Organizes Exports
    Hebei Native Produce Opens Up Sales Channels
    Last Year, Native Produce Exports Accounted for Sixty-Two Percent of the Province's Total Output
    [Reported by this newspaper] Native produce companies in various parts of Hebei are vigorously organizing the export of native produce and mountain goods. As of the end of last December, the export of native produce and mountain goods accounted for 62 percent of the province's total output of these materials.
    Some mountainous areas of Hebei are rich in peach kernels, apricot kernels, Chinese prickly ash, persimmons, chestnuts, black dates, and medicinal materials, which are important sources of income for local farmers. According to statistics from seven special districts including Xingtai, Handan, and Tangshan, last year's total output of mountain goods was 52,756,000 catties, and medicinal materials totaled 6,467,000 catties. Based on the average price of 2.22 catties of rice per catty of sales in November, the two items could be exchanged for more than 130 million catties of rice. However, in the past, poor sales channels had a significant impact on people's lives. In order to protect the interests of farmers and support the export of native produce, thanks to the efforts of the Shijiazhuang, Handan, Tangshan, Anguo and other native produce specialized branches and sub-companies, the sales channels of major mountain goods and medicinal materials have gradually opened up since the autumn of last year until the end of the year. According to statistics, the province exported a total of 36,580,000 catties of mountain goods and medicinal materials, accounting for more than 60 percent of the total output.
    In the process of purchasing, the native produce companies in various places, in conjunction with salt, grain, and general merchandise companies, purchased goods through local cooperatives while supplying farmers with essential industrial goods. The goods purchased by the Handan and Shijiazhuang companies through cooperatives accounted for 70 to 80 percent of the total purchases. At the same time, they supplied mountain farmers with more than 10,000 bolts of native cloth, 250,000 catties of edible salt, more than 500 bolts of foreign cloth, 2,800 catties of kerosene, 1,000 catties of paint, and a large amount of grain. The Tangshan Native Produce Branch Company (formerly Jidong Trading Company) supplied 900,000 catties of rice to local farmers in the autumn of last year, agreeing to exchange one catty of rice for one catty of chestnuts after the autumn harvest, and has now recovered and transported them to Tianjin for export. In the process of purchasing, the company appropriately reduced the price difference between mountain goods and grain. Last year, each catty of peach kernels could only be exchanged for two to three catties of rice, but this year it has been raised to five to six catties. In addition, because some areas paid attention to uniting legitimate merchants to purchase goods in remote mountainous areas, the goods accumulated by farmers in these areas were also able to be exported. Loans from the People's Bank of Handan and Anguo to support the export of native produce accounted for 40 to 50 percent of the total loans (including public and private enterprises). The Anguo Bank specifically organized three export merchants, Fuxingchang, Ruilong Gongji, and Chenxinghao, to handle the export of native produce through ordering, discounting, mortgage, and short-term credit, which enabled many previously closed export merchants such as Hongda Zhan and Dehecheng to become active again. At the same time, it also drove a lot of private capital. In Handan alone, private capital purchased 48,500 catties of peach kernels and more than 14,000 catties of Chinese prickly ash, which were transported to Tianjin for export. Private merchants in Shijiazhuang are also very active in exporting native produce. Currently, they have exported more than 1,680,000 catties of mountain goods, accounting for 32 percent of the city's total export of 5.2 million catties.
    In order to improve the quality of mountain goods and reduce costs, Shijiazhuang and Huolu have established two primary processing factories for native produce, which now have 300 workers. As a result of the processing, not only were transportation costs reduced, but the quality was also relatively improved, and it also led to the organization of mass sideline production.

    土产公司积极组织出口
    河北土产打开销路
    去年土产出口占全省总产量百分之六十二
    【本报讯】河北各地土产公司，大力组织土产山货输出，截至去年十二月底，土产、山货输出已占该省是项物资总产量的百分之六十二。
    河北部分山地，盛产桃仁、杏仁、花椒、柿、栗、乌枣及药材等，为当地农民重要收入之一。据邢台、邯郸、唐山等七个专区统计，去年共产山货五千二百七十五万六千斤，药材六百四十六万七千斤。按十一月销售每斤平均换米二点二二斤的价格，两项共能换米一亿三千余万斤。但过去由于销路不畅，影响人民生活甚大。为维护农民利益，扶植土产出口，经过石家庄、邯郸、唐山、安国等土产专业分、支公司的努力，自去年秋后至年底，主要山货药材已逐渐打开销路，据统计全省共输出山货、药材三千六百五十八万余斤，占总产量百分之六十以上。
    在收购过程中，各地土产公司结合盐、粮食、百货等专业公司，通过各地合作社，一面收购，一面供给农民工业必需品。邯郸、石家庄两公司通过合作社收购的货物占收购总数字百分之七十到八十。同时供给了山地农民土布万余匹，食盐二十五万斤，洋布五百余匹，煤油二千八百斤，颜料一千斤及大批粮食。唐山土产支公司（原冀东贸易公司）于去年秋季曾以九十万斤米供给当地农民，约定秋后每斤米换栗子一斤，现已收回运津输出。公司在收购过程中，适当缩小山货与粮食间的比价差额，桃仁去年每斤只换米二至三斤，今年已提到五至六斤。此外，由于有的地区注意了团结正当商人到山内偏僻地区采购，使该地农民积存的货物也得以输出。邯郸、安国等地人民银行扶持土产出口的贷款，已占总放款百分之四十到五十以上（包括公私营），安国银行通过订货，折实、抵押、及短期信贷具体组织了复兴昌、瑞隆公记、辰兴号三户出口商办理土产输出后，使前已歇业的出口商宏大栈、德合成等多户都活动起来。同时还带动了不少私资，仅邯郸所带动私资即收购桃仁四万八千五百斤，花椒一万四千余斤，运津输出。石家庄输出土产私商也很活跃，目前已输出山货一百六十八万多斤，占全市总输出五百二十万斤的百分之三十二。
    为了提高山货质量，减低成本，石家庄、获鹿成立了两个土产初级加工工厂，现已有三百名工人。由于加工的结果，不仅减低了运费，且质量亦相对提高，还附带组织了群众的副业生产。
