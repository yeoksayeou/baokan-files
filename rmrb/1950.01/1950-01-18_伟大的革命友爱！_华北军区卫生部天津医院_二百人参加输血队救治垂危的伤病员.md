Great Revolutionary Friendship!
    Tianjin Hospital of the North China Military Region Health Department
    200 People Join Blood Transfusion Team to Rescue Critically Ill and Injured

    [Our Dispatch] Tianjin General Hospital of the Logistics and Health Department of the North China Military Region formed a blood transfusion team of more than 200 staff members to rescue critically ill and injured patients. The formation of the blood transfusion team began with a call issued by the hospital leaders at a military personnel meeting. After the meeting, the CCP branch conducted in-depth discussions within the Party, requiring Party members to take a leading role in ensuring the completion of the blood transfusion mission. All departments simultaneously launched discussions, and everyone responded enthusiastically, signing up one after another. Within six days, a total of 265 people signed up: twelve doctors, seven medical administrative cadres, thirty-eight nursing staff, sixteen political cadres, twenty-five cadres from the Supply and Management Office, and one hundred and sixty-seven soldiers and attendants. By the end of December, 209 people had been checked for blood type. Since the establishment of the blood transfusion team, team leader Guo Changhua, correspondent Li Hongbin, cultural instructor Wang Shuxian, administrator Wei Jinyuan, and others have donated blood ranging from 300CC to 150CC for injured and sick personnel. Whenever injured and sick personnel needed blood transfusions for treatment, the team members eagerly requested to donate blood, demonstrating a high degree of revolutionary friendship.
