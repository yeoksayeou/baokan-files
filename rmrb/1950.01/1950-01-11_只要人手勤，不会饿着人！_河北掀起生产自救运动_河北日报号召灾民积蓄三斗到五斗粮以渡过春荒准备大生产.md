As long as people are diligent, no one will starve!
Hebei launches a production self-salvation movement.
The Hebei Daily calls on disaster victims to accumulate three to five dou of grain to survive the spring famine and prepare for large-scale production.

[This newspaper reports] A production relief movement has been widely launched in disaster areas of Hebei Province. Under the leadership of the People's Government, ten million disaster victims across the province are organizing to engage in sideline production, using their own labor to combat the severe famine. On New Year's Day this year, the Hebei Daily, the official newspaper of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, vigorously called on every disaster victim with labor power in an editorial to accumulate three to five dou of grain from winter sideline production to survive this year's spring famine and lay a solid foundation for spring plowing. In the vigorous development of sideline production in the province, from mountains to plains, from riverbanks to coastlines, disaster victims are engaged in various sideline productions based on the different local conditions. In the five severely affected regions of Tangshan, Tianjin, Baoding, Tongxian, and Cangxian, the types of sideline activities launched have reached more than a dozen.

The textile industry is very developed with the support of cooperatives supplying yarn and cotton, and purchasing cloth. In Wen'an, Baodi, Wuqing, and Dacheng counties in the Tianjin region alone, more than 3,200 looms have been put into operation, producing more than 5,400 bolts of cloth per day, earning more than 27,000 catties of red sorghum. The famous Gaoyang native cloth industry in Hebei, under the leadership and support of the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company, is constantly improving and developing. Through production such as contract weaving, printing and dyeing, ginning, and thread sorting, the company paid wages of 3.36 million catties of red sorghum from mid-September to November and directly supplied foreign yarn to weavers, providing raw materials for 600 looms. Now Gaoyang weaving can exchange for an average of 50,000 catties of red sorghum per day. Women in other regions such as Tangshan, Cangxian, and Shijiazhuang are also enthusiastically spinning and weaving. Their products are sold to vast rural areas in Northeast and Northwest China. The people in these disaster areas reflect, "As long as people are diligent, there is no fear of starvation."

Cooperatives in various regions organize textile production to overcome famine. People's representatives and village cadres boil saltpeter.

The saltpeter boiling industry produces saltpeter, which is an indispensable raw material for making baking soda, sodium sulfide, and gypsum powder, and has a wide market. More than 400 disaster-stricken villages in five counties, including Jinghai in the Tianjin region, rely on this for a living, producing an average of 150,000 catties of saltpeter per day; more than 10,000 households in Wen'an County also rely on this for a living. The People's Representative Conference of all circles in the Tianjin region plans to produce 10 million catties of saltpeter in the winter, which can be exchanged for about 4 million catties of millet. In many disaster areas without saltpeter boiling experience, some people's representatives and cadres personally learned the techniques elsewhere and taught them to everyone. Meng Jizhong, a representative from Koutou Village in Wen'an County, led 102 households in the village to boil saltpeter in this way. Zhang Rongsheng's family of five in the village boils 100 catties of saltpeter every two days, exchanging it for more than 30 catties of corn, with some left over after eating. In the coastal area of Tangshan region, which is about 300 li long and 20 to 30 li wide, saltpeter can be boiled. The commissioner's office specially sent ten cadres to Cangxian County to learn saltpeter boiling techniques in order to develop this production undertaking. The provincial supply and marketing cooperative also set up saltpeter collection stations in various saltpeter-producing areas to facilitate the sale of saltpeter by disaster victims and signed contracts with various saltpeter-using factories in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places to sell their products. The disaster victims said, "Since the Communist Party came, the saline-alkali land has also turned into golden saline-alkali land."

Riverine disaster areas organize fishery production.

Fishery is the main sideline production in riverine, lakeside, and coastal disaster areas of the province. Now the disaster victims have been organized. Those with production tools fish, and those without boats and nets transport and sell fishery products. Division of labor and cooperation have increased production. They also send special personnel to large cities to promote sales, reducing the intermediate exploitation by fish merchants. The government provides strong support, granting loans to solve the difficulties of some fishermen who lack nets and boats. Xin'an County in the Baoding region mobilized disaster victims to engage in fishery production, solving the livelihood problems of 100,000 people. In order to solve the difficulties of river freezing, more than 10,000 fishermen in Jinghai, Wen'an, Baxian, and Shengfang counties in the Tianjin region organized more than 140 winter netting teams; at the same time, they also promoted the production of net weaving, reed mat making, and blood netting. So that the lonely, widowed, old, and young all have avenues for production.

In reed-producing areas, disaster victims were organized to engage in mat weaving production. More than 1.196 million pieces have been produced in eight counties and towns in the Tianjin region, including Shengfang, and are sold to vast areas in Northeast China. The 650,000 mu of new reeds have been harvested, and this business will have greater development.

Develop transportation and preserve livestock.

Due to the general lack of animal feed in disaster areas, some areas have experienced the starvation of draft animals. In order to preserve draft animals, most places, under the in-depth leadership of cadres, have organized livestock to engage in sideline production such as transporting coal, grain, salt, and mountain fruits. This not only preserved the livestock but also supported many people with the income from production. In Wu'an County in the Handan region, 19 villages organized 138 carts for transportation, earning more than 40,000 catties of rice in late December last year. The area suffered less from the disaster this year, and farmers, seeing the benefits of transportation, bought 680 more livestock in 48 villages.

In addition to the above-mentioned major sideline productions, Dingxian, Hengshui, Shijiazhuang, Handan, Xingtai, and other regions with lighter disasters have also widely launched sideline productions such as oil pressing, flour making, and tofu grinding. Accumulate more fertilizer, earn more money, and lay the foundation for this year's production. In mountainous areas, sideline productions such as transporting and selling mountain fruits and collecting medicinal materials have been launched.

The Hebei Provincial People's Government strongly supported sideline production through cooperatives. In opening up sales channels, they promoted products to Northeast, Northwest, and even Shanghai and Nanjing. In terms of production funds, in addition to mobilizing the masses to find ways themselves, the government provided key loans to support them.

In addition, attention was paid to leading the masses to develop a variety of sideline productions, so that most disaster victims could be involved in the production movement. In addition to the above-mentioned major production avenues, the masses were mobilized to weave willow, weave cattail, pick straw hat braids, dig medicinal materials, collect firewood, and even sew shoe soles and weave straw sandals, and were given support separately so that production was not limited to a narrow scope, thus achieving great results.

    只要人手勤，不会饿着人！
    河北掀起生产自救运动
    河北日报号召灾民积蓄三斗到五斗粮以渡过春荒准备大生产
    【本报讯】河北省各地灾区生产救灾运动普遍开展。全省一千万灾民在人民政府领导下，正组织起来从事副业生产，用自己的劳力向严重的灾荒作斗争。今年元旦，中共河北省委机关报河北日报，更在社论中有力地号召每一个有劳动力的灾民，要从冬季副业生产中积蓄三斗到五斗粮，以渡过今年春荒，并给春耕打下有力的基础。该省在大力开展副业生产中，从山地到平原，从滨河到沿海，灾民各根据本地不同的条件经营各种副业生产。唐山、天津、保定、通县、沧县五个灾情最重的专区，活动起来的副业已达十数种。
    纺织业，在各地合作社供给纱、棉，收购布匹的扶助下非常发达，仅天津专区的文安、宝坻、武清、大城等四县，就开动织布机三千二百余架。日产布五千四百余匹。可赚红粮两万七千多斤。河北著名高阳土布业，现在国营花纱布公司的领导与扶持下，已在不断的提高和发展。该公司通过代织、印染、轧花、拣合线等生产，自九月中旬至十一月即支付工资米三百三十六万斤红粮，并直接供给纺织者洋纱，使织机六百架得到原料。现在高阳织布每日平均可换得红粮五万斤。其他如唐山专区，沧县专区，及石家庄专区妇女们也多热烈纺纱织布。产品销到东北及西北的广大农村中去。这些灾区人民反映：“只要人手勤，不怕饿着人。”
    各地合作社组织纺织渡荒  人民代表和村干部熬硝
    熬硝业，皮硝是制小苏达、硫化碱、石明粉等不可缺少的原料，销路很广。天津专区静海等五个县四百多个受灾村依此为生，平均每日产硝十五万斤；文安县也有一万余户以此为生。天津专区各县各界人民代表会议上计划冬季生产硝一千万斤，约可换回小米四百万斤。许多没有熬硝经验的灾区，有的人民代表和干部亲自到别处学会技术教给大家。文安县口头村代表孟继中就这样带动全村一百零二户熬硝。该村张荣生一家五口，每两天熬硝一百斤。换回三十多斤玉米，除吃还有剩。唐山专区沿海约有三百里长、二十到三十里宽的地区可以熬硝。专署特派十名干部到沧县学习熬硝技术，以便开展这一生产事业。省供销合作社并在各产硝地区设立收硝站，便利制硝灾民出卖。并与京、津等地各用硝工厂订立合同销售产品。灾民说：“共产党来了，灾碱地也变成金碱地了。”
    滨河灾区组织渔业生产
    渔业是该省沿河、沿湖、沿海灾区的主要副业生产。现灾民已经组织起来。有生产工具的打鱼，无船无网灾民则运销渔产。分工合作产量提高。他们更派专人到大城市推销，减少鱼行中间剥削。政府则大力扶助，贷给款项。解决一部分渔民无网、船的困难。保定专区新安县发动灾民进行渔业生产，解决了十万人生活问题。为解决冰冻河封的困难，天津专区静海、文安、霸县、胜芳四县万余渔民组织了冬网班一百四十多个；同时又带动了结网打箔、血网等生产。使孤寡老幼都有了生产门路。
    在产苇地区，组织灾民进行了编席业生产，仅天津专区胜芳等八个县镇，已生产一百一十九万六千多片。销于东北广大地区。现六十五万亩新苇已经收割，此项业务将有更大的发展。
            发展运输保存牲口
    由于灾区普遍缺少畜草，个别地区已有饿死耕畜的现象发生。为了保存耕畜，大多数地方，都在干部深入领导下，把牲畜组织起来，进行运输煤、粮、盐、山果等副业生产品。不仅保住了牲口，且以生产所得养活了许多人。邯郸专区武安县有十九个村，组织起一百三十八辆大车搞运输，在去年十二月下旬赚米四万多斤。该地今年受灾较轻，农民看到搞运输有利，有四十八个村还买了六百八十多头牲口。
    除以上数种主要的副业生产外，在灾情较轻的定县、衡水、石家庄、邯郸、邢台等专区也广泛展开了榨油、制粉、磨豆腐等副业生产。多积肥、多赚钱，为今年生产打下基础。在山地则开展了运销山果，采集药材等副业生产。
    河北省人民政府通过合作社大力扶植了副业生产。在打开销路上，他们把产品推销到东北、西北以至沪宁等地。在生产资金上，除发动群众自己尽量设法外，政府有重点的发放贷款予以支持。
    此外并注意领导群众发展多种多样的副业生产，使大多数灾民投入生产运动中。除如上所述各项主要生产门路外，又发动群众编柳、编蒲、掏草帽辫、刨药材、打柴，以至于纳鞋底、编草鞋……等，并分别加以扶助，不使生产限入狭小范围。因而获得巨大成绩。
