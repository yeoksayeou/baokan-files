    Suggestions to the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government Regarding the Organization of Private Ship Transportation Companies
    (Passed by the National Conference of Seamen's Union Representatives from various regions on December 26, 1949.
    Approved by the Expanded Meeting of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on January 5, 1950)
    In order to give full play to the transport capacity of private ships, eliminate the guild monopolies and feudal exploitation of private empty transportation firms, facilitate the exchange of goods, organize and educate workers, and safeguard and improve workers' lives, we hereby suggest that the navigation authorities of the Central People's Government organize private ship transportation companies. Specific suggestions are as follows:
    1. The transportation company should organize scattered private ships on a voluntary basis, with emphasis and step-by-step implementation, implement planned transportation, unify the allocation of ships, unify the adjustment of freight rates, eliminate intermediate exploitation, facilitate the exchange of goods, and assist trade unions in organizing and educating workers to safeguard and improve their lives.
    2. The transportation company should extract a certain percentage of handling fees from the freight rates, and 50% of the handling fees should be used as a fund for workers' cultural, educational, and welfare undertakings, which should be handed over to the private ship trade union to handle workers' welfare undertakings.
    3. A policy of registration and consolidation should be adopted for private transportation firms. Those private firms that do not abide by government laws and engage in illegal activities must be strictly banned.

    关于组织民船运输公司  向中央人民政府交通部的建议
    （一九四九年十二月二十六日全国各地海员工会代表会议通过
    一九五○年一月五日中华全国总工会常务委员会扩大会议批准）
    为了发挥民船的运输作用，消灭私人的空头运输行号的行会垄断与封建剥削，便利物资交流，组织和教育工人，保障与改善工人生活起见，特建议中央人民政府航务机关组织民船运输公司。具体意见如下：
    一、运输公司应根据自愿的原则，有重点有步骤地组织分散的民船，实施计划运输，统一调配船只，统一调整运价，消灭中间剥削，便利物资交流，并协助工会组织和教育工人保障与改善工人生活。
    二、运输公司在运价中提取若干之手续费，应以手续费的百分之五十作为办理工人文化、教育、福利事业的基金，交给民船工会办理工人福利事业。
    三、对于私人运输行号，要采取登记整理的方针。这些私营行号如不遵守政府法令而进行非法活动者，必须严加取缔。
