    Qinghe Textile Factory Rectifies Discipline
    Zhou Baotong Expelled for Accepting Bribes
    [Beijing News] Zhou Baotong, a clerk in the Management Section of the Qinghe Textile Factory, accepted bribes from the private merchant Dongxing Shun Wool Shop. He failed to ensure that the wool purchased was properly cleaned of dirt, causing the factory to lose 900 jin of wool, worth over 5 million yuan, affecting production costs. To rectify labor discipline, the factory has expelled Zhou Baotong. In early November of last year, the factory purchased 7,000 jin of wool from the private merchant Dongxing Shun Wool Shop, stipulating that it should be sifted and cleaned of dirt. Zhou Baotong, a clerk from the factory's Management Section, was sent to supervise. Dongxing Shun, seeking to profit greatly, resorted to bribery, giving Zhou Baotong 80,000 yuan and two boxes of cigarettes and treating him to six meals. They also gave him 100,000 yuan to give to Wang Chenxun, the head of the Management Section, saying it was "for buying snacks for the children." Zhou took the money to Wang's home, saying, "This is a gift from Dongxing Shun." Three days later, Zhou told Wang about the matter, and Wang reported it to the factory. The factory sent people to inspect 2,000 jin of the newly purchased wool and found that the dirt had been removed from the top of the bales but not from the bottom. The factory questioned Zhou Baotong three times about whether he had accepted bribes, but Zhou firmly denied it. After the fact that he had accepted a 100,000 yuan bribe on behalf of Section Chief Wang was revealed, he confessed to the bribery. The Management Section held two criticism meetings to educate him, but Zhou still refused to confess his mistakes honestly. On December 14th of last year, the factory held an expanded meeting of staff and cadres, and everyone unanimously agreed that, in addition to confiscating the bribe money, Zhou Baotong should be expelled. At the factory's workers' representative meeting on the 30th of last month, everyone also approved this action and ordered Dongxing Shun to compensate for the losses.

    清河制呢厂整饬纪律
    周宝桐受贿被开除
    【北京讯】清河制呢厂经理科杂员周宝桐，受私商东兴顺毛栈贿赂，买毛不抖土，使工厂损失羊毛九百斤，合五百多万元，影响了生产成本，该厂为整饬劳动纪律已将周宝桐开除出厂。去年十一月初，该厂向私商东兴顺毛栈买到羊毛七千斤，说明过筛抖土，派该厂经营科杂员周宝桐前往监视。东兴顺为贪图厚利竟使用贿赂手段，前后送给周宝桐八万元、两盒烟，请他吃了六顿饭；并拿十万元，让他送给经营科王臣勋科长、说是“给小孩买吃的”。周就把钱送到王家，说“这是东兴顺送的礼”。过了三天，周把这件事告诉了王科长，王即将此事报告厂方。厂方派人检查新买的两千斤毛，发现包口上面的抖了土，底下的没抖。厂方曾盘问周宝桐三次是否受贿，周坚不承认。经提出他代王科长受贿十万元的事实后，他才承认了受贿的经过。为这件事，经营科曾举行两次检讨会，予以教育，但周仍不坦白认错。去年十二月十四日，该厂召开扩大职员干部会议，大家一致同意：除将贿款没收外，周宝桐应予开除。在上月三十日，该厂工人代表会上，大家也通过如此办理，并令东兴顺赔偿损失。
