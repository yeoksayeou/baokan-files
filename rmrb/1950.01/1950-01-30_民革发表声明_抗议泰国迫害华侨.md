    Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Issues Statement
    Protesting Thailand's Persecution of Overseas Chinese
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch] The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued the following statement regarding the Thai government's persecution of overseas Chinese:
    The Thai reactionary fascist government's animosity towards the Chinese people is historical. Recently, the Phibun Songkhram reactionary clique has intensified its barbaric and unreasonable, lawless and violent actions, implementing its consistent and vicious anti-Chinese policy, continuously persecuting and arresting Chinese nationals. This is an outrageous act that is absolutely intolerable to civilized humanity. Our Deputy Foreign Minister Li of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a protest with the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 27th of this month, solemnly demanding that Thailand: (1) immediately cease the mistreatment of overseas Chinese detained in Bangkok's major prisons; (2) release these overseas Chinese and cease deporting overseas Chinese; and (3) guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. We confirm that the above three points are entirely in line with just and legal protests, and express our warm and firm support.
    Since August 1948, the Phibun Songkhram clique has formulated a series of "Occupational Reservation Regulations," destroying the industry and commerce of overseas Chinese, making it impossible for hundreds of thousands of our compatriots to live. Going back to 1946, it closed many overseas Chinese schools, depriving overseas Chinese of their cultural and educational freedom, causing 200,000 children to be out of school. Thousands of overseas Chinese are now being held in Thai prisons awaiting deportation, and they have been detained for nearly half a year. Some are imprisoned in the most brutal underground darkrooms, and some are shackled with chains on their feet and handcuffs on their hands, not to mention beatings and insults. The hell on earth in Bangkok is becoming more and more crowded and vicious, and the resentment felt by Chinese nationals is becoming deeper and deeper! We not only deeply cherish the overseas Chinese who live far away from their homeland in Thailand, but we must also assist in rescuing them from fascist persecution.
    We Chinese people are naturally willing to live in friendly peace with all countries, but we will never allow Thailand's shameless atrocities to continue to be inflicted on overseas Chinese. Now that the great revolutionary cause of the Chinese people has achieved victory, the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people residing overseas must be respected and guaranteed against infringement. We hereby declare.

### 民革发表声明  抗议泰国迫害华侨

    民革发表声明
    抗议泰国迫害华侨
    【新华社讯】中国国民党革命委员会为泰国政府迫害华侨事发表声明如下：
    泰国反动法西斯政府对于中国人民的敌意，是有历史性的。近来銮披汶反动集团更变本加厉地野蛮无理，罔法暴行，施用它一贯的毒辣排华政策，不断地迫害和拘捕中国侨民，这是冒天下之大不韪，绝对为文明人类所不容许的。我们中央人民政府外交部李副部长为这件事于本月二十七日向泰国外交部提出抗议，严正地要求泰国：（一）立即停止对于被拘押在曼谷大监狱的华侨的虐待行为，（二）释放这些华侨并停止驱逐华侨出境，（三）保证以后不再发生同样事件。以上三点，我们确认是完全符合正义和法律的抗议，热烈地表示坚决的拥护。
    銮披汶集团自一九四八年八月制定了一系列的“职业保留条例”，摧残华侨工商业，使我们数十万侨胞无法生活下去。再推前至一九四六年，它查封了许多华侨学校，剥夺了华侨的文化教育自由，致令二十万儿童失学。现在侨胞被关在泰京监狱里等待驱逐的数以千计，而被拘押的时间已近半年了。有的被幽禁在最残酷的地下暗室，有的长系着脚镣手铐，至于殴打辱骂犹其余事。泰京的人间地狱越拥挤越凶狠，中国侨胞所感觉的怨恨越深沉！我们对于远离祖国侨居泰国的侨胞不但寄以深切的怀念，并必协助援救侨胞出于法西斯的迫害。
    我们中国人民自然很愿意友好的和平的与各国相处，但决不容许泰国的无耻暴行继续加诸侨胞的身上。现在中国人民的伟大革命事业已经取得了胜利，中国在海外侨居人民的正当权益必须得到尊重和不受侵犯的保证。谨此声明。
