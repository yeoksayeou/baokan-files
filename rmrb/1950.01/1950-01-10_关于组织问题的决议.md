Resolution on Organizational Matters
(Passed by the National Conference of Representatives of Seamen's Unions on December 26, 1949
Approved by the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on January 5, 1950)

The National Conference of Representatives of Seamen's Unions, in accordance with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' notice on organizing industrial unions and the specific conditions of China's water transport industry, hereby makes the following resolutions on several organizational issues of organizing the National Seamen's Union:

    I. The scope of organization of the Chinese Seamen's Union shall include all employed laborers engaged in the water transport industry, whether belonging to public or private enterprises, and regardless of whether they work on large ships, small steamers, motorized sailing vessels, tugs and barges, or in shipbuilding yards, dock warehouses, hospitals, schools, and other departments affiliated with shipping companies. However, those who act as agents of the capitalists and exercise the functions of the capitalists shall not be allowed to join the union.

    Staff and workers on customs vessels shall join the customs union. Ferries shall be organized according to the industrial sector to which they belong, such as railway-affiliated ferries, which shall belong to the railway union, and municipal ferries and punts, which shall belong to the municipal union.

    Fishermen shall join the food industry union, but before the food industry union is established, they may be temporarily led by the seamen's union.

    Workers on private ships shall establish a separate private ship union. Before the establishment of the National Private Ship Union, the Seamen's Union shall establish a Private Ship Work Committee to lead its work.

    II. The Chinese Seamen's Union shall be organized according to the industry and the administrative system of managing the industry. The country shall be divided into the following seven regions, and regional committees of the Chinese Seamen's Union shall be established under the direct leadership of the National Committee:

    1.  Northeast Regional Committee, centered in Dalian, including all coastal ports in Northeast China and their inland river routes.
    2.  North China Regional Committee, centered in Tianjin, including all coastal ports in Hebei Province and inland river routes in North China provinces.
    3.  Shandong Regional Committee, centered in Qingdao, including all coastal ports in Shandong Province and their inland river routes.
    4.  East China Regional Committee, centered in Shanghai, including coastal ports and inland river routes in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. Before the establishment of the Taiwan Regional Committee due to Taiwan's non-liberation, coastal ports and inland river routes in Fujian Province shall be temporarily led by the East China Regional Committee.
    5.  South China Regional Committee, centered in Guangzhou, including coastal and inland river routes in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan Island.
    6.  Central China Regional Committee, centered in Wuhan, including inland river routes in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces.
    7.  Southwest Regional Committee, centered in Chongqing, including inland river routes in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang.

    Each regional committee shall organize local committees (such as the Nanjing Committee or the Ningbo Committee), which shall be directly led by the regional committee. However, in the location where the regional committee is stationed, a local committee shall not be established separately (such as Shanghai, where the East China Regional Committee is located, and therefore a Shanghai Committee will not be established), and the East China Regional Committee shall be directly responsible for the work of the local committee in its location.

    Under each local committee, committees shall be organized according to industrial units, such as shipping companies, small steamer companies, motorized sailing vessel companies, short-term piloting, and navigation administration agencies. Private ships shall establish a single private ship union committee, which shall be under the unified leadership of the local committee.

    Under the shipping company committee, committees shall be established for units such as ships, dock warehouses, and shipyards. Small steamers shall establish a joint committee. Under each committee, groups shall be formed according to the different production or work departments of each unit; small steamers and tugs shall establish groups by vessel.

    Any production department with 25 or more people shall establish a committee, and those with fewer than 25 people shall establish a group.

    Piloting (short-term employed pilots) union committees shall establish union committees for each route according to the different routes, with subgroups (pilots employed long-term by shipping companies shall participate in the union organization within the shipping company committee to which they belong). Pilots who are managed by the navigation authorities shall be led by the union committee of the navigation authorities.

    Local private ship union committees with a large number of people shall organize union committees of the same type according to the different types of cargo they carry, or set up office branches at each dock. Those with a small number of people shall be directly managed by the local committee in their respective private ship groups, but problem-solving must be centralized in the private ship union committee for unified resolution.

    III. The relationship between the National Committee and the local committees:

    1.  All issues involving international and national matters shall be resolved by the National Committee (before the formal establishment of the National Committee, it shall be resolved by the Preparatory Committee).

    2.  Problems that cannot be resolved between equivalent-level union committees shall be resolved by the immediately higher-level committee to which they each directly belong.

    3.  Regarding the relationship between the general shipping company committee and its branch company committees, all issues of a unified nature for the entire company shall be decided uniformly by the general company committee. Local issues of branch companies shall be resolved by the branch company committees. When the general company committee has issues involving the local committee, it must consult with the local committee to obtain its consent and assistance in resolving them.

    4.  When all shipping union committees arrive at a certain place for berthing, they shall report their work to the local committee and accept its guidance; at the same time, the local committee has the responsibility to assist and guide the work of all shipping union committees berthing locally, and shall report the situation of assisting and guiding their work to their original agency. However, the local committee shall not change the resolutions and instructions of the upper-level organizations of the respective shipping union committees.

    关于组织问题的决议
    （一九四九年十二月二十六日全国各地海员工会代表会议通过
    一九五○年一月五日中华全国总工会常务委员会扩大会议批准）
    全国各地海员工会代表会议，根据中华全国总工会关于组织产业工会的通知，和中国水上运输事业的具体情况，对于组织全国海员工会的几个组织问题，特作决议如下：
    一、中国海员工会的组织范围，应包括所有从事水上运输事业之雇佣劳动者，不论是属于公营或私营企业，也不论是大轮船、小火轮、机帆、拖驳与轮船公司及其所附设的修船厂、码头仓库、医院、学校等部门中工作的工人职员及引水人员在内。但凡属执行资方职权之资方代理人，则不能加入工会。
    海关船只之职工加入海关工会，轮渡则按其所属之企业部门归各该产业工会组织，如铁路附设的轮渡则归铁路工会，市政轮渡和摆渡则归市政工会。
    渔业工人应加入食品业工会，但在食品工会尚未成立前，可暂由海员工会领导。
    民船工人应成立单独的民船工会，但在全国民船工会尚未成立前，由海员工会成立民船工作委员会领导其工作。
    二、中国海员工会按照产业与管理产业的行政系统组织之。并在全国划分为下列七个地区，建立中国海员工会地区委员会，直属全国委员会领导：
    １、东北区委员会以大连为中心，包括东北沿海各口岸及其内河各航线。
    ２、华北区委员会以天津为中心，包括河北省沿海各口岸和华北各省内河航线。
    ３、山东区委员会以青岛为中心，包括山东省沿海各口岸及其内河航线。
    ４、华东区委员会以上海为中心，包括江苏、浙江、安徽三省的沿海口岸及内河航线。在因台湾未解放而暂不成立台湾区委员会之前，福建沿海各口岸及内河航线暂归华东区委员会领导。
    ５、华南区委员会以广州为中心，包括广东、广西及海南岛等沿海航线及内河航线。
    ６、华中区委员会以武汉为中心，包括河南、湖北、湖南、江西四省的内河航线。
    ７、西南区委员会以重庆为中心，包括四川、云南、贵州、西康内河各航线。
    各地区委员会下组织地方委员会（如南京委员会或宁波委员会等）直属地区委员会领导，但地区委员会驻在地，则不另设地方委员会（如华东区委员会所在地的上海，则不再设上海委员会），由华东地区委员会直接负责其驻在地的地方委员会的工作。
    各地方委员会之下，按照产业单位，组织轮船公司、小火轮公司、机帆船公司、短期引水、航政机关的委员会，民船则成立单一的民船工会委员会，由地方委员会统一领导。
    轮船公司委员会下成立轮船、码头仓库、修船厂等单位的委员会，小火轮则成立联合委员会。在各委员会之下，按各单位的生产部门或工作部门之不同分组各小组；小火轮、拖驳则以船只为单位成立小组。
    凡二十五人以上之生产部门则成立委员会，二十五人以下者成立小组。
    引水（短期雇佣的引水人员）工会委员会，则按航线之不同成立各航线的工会委员会，下分小组（其属轮船公司长期雇佣之引水人员，则参加其所属之轮船公司委员会内之工会组织）。已由航务机关管理之引水人员，则由航务机关之工会委员会领导之。
    各地方民船工会委员会人数多的则按其装货性质之不同，组织同一类型的工会委员会，或设各码头办事处，人数少的则由地方委员会直接管理各民船小组，但解决问题须集中于民船工会委员会统一解决。
    三、全国委员会、各地委员会之相互关系：
    １、凡涉及国际性与全国性的问题，统由全国委员会解决（全国委员会未正式成立前由筹备委员会解决）。
    ２、凡同级工会委员会相互之间所不能解决的问题，由各该直属之上一级的委员会解决之。
    ３、各轮船总公司委员会与其分公司委员会之间的关系，凡属全公司统一性的问题由总公司委员会统一决定。凡属分公司的局部问题，由分公司委员会解决之。总公司委员会对分公司委员会有牵涉到地方委员会的问题时，须与地方委员会协商，取得其同意与帮助解决之。
    ４、所有轮船工会委员会到达某地停泊时，应向当地地方委员会报告工作并接受其指导；同时地方委员会对所有各地停泊在本地之轮船工会委员会，亦有责任帮助与指导其工作，并将协助与指导其工作的情况转告其原属机关。但地方委员会不得更动各该轮船工会委员会上级组织的决议与指示。
