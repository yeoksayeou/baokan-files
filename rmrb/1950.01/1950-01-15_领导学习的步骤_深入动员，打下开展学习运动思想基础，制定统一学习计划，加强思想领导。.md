    Steps to Lead Learning
    Deep mobilization, laying the ideological foundation for carrying out learning movements, formulating unified learning plans, and strengthening ideological leadership.
    The development of the learning movement over the year can be roughly divided into three stages: The first stage, before April, was mainly focused on ideological mobilization in various regions, laying the ideological foundation for carrying out the learning movement. Party committees at all levels repeatedly conveyed and implemented the decision of the North China Bureau of the CCP regarding the education of on-the-job cadres, mobilized cadres to conduct group discussions, examined each cadre's understanding and attitude towards learning, and carried out criticism and self-criticism on learning, overcoming the tendencies among cadres of belittling learning, thinking that "illiteracy is no obstacle to work," or holding negative attitudes towards learning, thinking that "worker-peasant cadres are losing their advantage," or emphasizing that "work is too busy, there is no time to study," etc. At the same time, learning time was adjusted, and it was stipulated that all departments, except special ones, should study for two hours in the morning; the learning method emphasized collective self-study, which facilitated mutual supervision and cultivation of learning habits. The second stage, after April, cadre learning generally attracted attention in various regions. Party committees at all levels seized the opportunity to establish learning organizations, delineate classes, and establish spare-time schools in institutions above the county level, formulating learning plans. Generally, attention was paid to being selective and concise, progressing from the near to the far, and from the shallow to the deep, overcoming the two tendencies of having no plan in learning or having overly high plan requirements. They also adhered to the testing system and reporting system, which played a certain role in promoting the learning movement. The third stage, after the establishment of the province in August, began to formulate and implement a unified provincial plan for the learning content of on-the-job cadres, strictly stipulated the learning steps, further strengthened the organizational leadership of learning, and began to pay attention to ideological leadership in learning. Before the start of learning each document and each chapter, the study committee first put forward the purpose, requirements and focus of learning, and guided how to relate to reality, what documents to refer to, and also made enlightening speeches; during the learning process, difficulties were collected at any time, and discussions and reports were organized, overcoming the past empiricism or dogmatism in learning. The Provincial Study Committee and the Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee, the Tangshan Municipal Party Committee, and the Hengshui Prefectural Committee also published learning publications to guide learning. The learning methods for levels A and B were mainly self-study, combined with informal talks, discussions, and note-taking, and lectures were also given when necessary. Level C focused on cultural learning, and 153 cadre cultural supplementary schools were established in ten special districts, four cities, and directly subordinate organs of the province, with a total of 24,223 students. District-level cadres scattered in rural areas mainly learned through mutual assistance, combined with the help of primary school teachers.
    At present, the shortcomings in cadre learning in Hebei Province are that the leadership is not unified, not sound and effective enough, lacks active ideological leadership, and there is still formalism in organizational leadership. Secondly, regarding the issue of learning classification, although it has been adjusted two or three times, overcoming the simple method of classifying by position or by academic qualifications, some cadres still have the idea of "rather be high than low," and the leadership also has the idea of "accommodating and making do," resulting in inconsistency in stringency. Because there is no strictly unified organizational foundation, the educational policies and plans cannot be implemented accurately and appropriately. In the future, we must strengthen ideological leadership and organizational leadership, unify work and study, strengthen learning mutual assistance, conduct inspections and assessments in a timely manner, adjust levels, and overcome chaotic phenomena, so as to further improve the cadre learning of the whole province.

    领导学习的步骤
    深入动员，打下开展学习运动思想基础，制定统一学习计划，加强思想领导。
    一年中学习运动的发展，大致可分为三个阶段：第一阶段，四月以前，各地区主要是进行思想动员，打下开展学习运动的思想基础，各级党委反复传达贯彻中共中央华北局关于在职干部教育的决定，发动干部作小组讨论，检查每个干部的学习认识和态度，开展学习上的批评和自我批评，克服干部中存在的轻视学习，认为“不识字也一样工作”，或对学习抱消极态度，认为“工农干部吃不开了”，或强调“工作忙，没时间学习”等偏向；同时调整学习时间，除特殊部门外，一律规定在早晨学习两小时；学习方法则强调集体自修，便于互相督促，养成学习习惯。第二阶段，四月以后，干部学习大体上已引起各地注意，各级党委抓紧了建立学习组织，划定班级，县以上机关都成立业余学校，制定学习计划。一般注意了少而精、由近到远、由浅到深，克服了学习中没计划或计划要求过高的两种偏向，还坚持了测验制度和汇报制度等，对推进学习运动起了一定作用。第三阶段，八月建省以后，开始制定并实行统一全省在职干部学习内容的计划，严格规定了学习步骤，进一步加强了学习的组织领导，并开始注意学习中的思想领导。在每个文件和每一章篇开始学习以前，学委会先提出学习的目的、要求和重点，并指导怎样联系实际，参考什么文件，还作启发发言；学习进程中随时搜集疑难，组织讨论、报告，克服过去学习中的经验主义或教条主义。省级学委会和石家庄市委、唐山市委与衡水地委并出版了学习刊物，以指导学习。学习的方式，甲、乙两级以自学为主，结合漫谈、讨论、作笔记，必要时也有讲授。丙级以文化学习为主，全省十个专区、四个市和省直属机关，共建立了干部文化补习学校一百五十三处，一共有学员二万四千二百二十三名。分散在农村的区级干部，主要以互助方式学习，结合小学教师的帮助。
    现在，河北省干部学习中的缺点，是领导上不够统一，不够健全有力，缺乏主动的思想领导，组织领导上还存有形式主义。其次，学习的编级问题，虽然经过了两三次调整，克服了单纯的以职位分级或以学历分级的方法，但有些干部还有“宁高勿低”思想，领导上也有“迁就凑合”的思想，宽严不一致。由于没有严格划一的组织基础，教育方针、计划就不能确切适当的贯彻。今后必须加强思想领导和组织领导，使工作和学习统一，加强学习互助，及时进行检查和考核，调整级别，克服混乱现象，以便把全省的干部学习再提高一步。
