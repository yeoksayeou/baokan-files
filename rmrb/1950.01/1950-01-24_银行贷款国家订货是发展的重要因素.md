The law of industrial and commercial development in Shijiazhuang City over the past year has proven that industries and businesses that meet the needs of the broad masses of the people have developed: industries such as ironworks manufacturing agricultural tools, wrought iron, tinplate, and weaving, chemicals, oil extraction, construction, and brick and tile; and businesses such as grain, cloth, coal, ironware, warehouses, groceries, inns, cotton and oil. Those industries and businesses that do not meet the needs of the people or are not urgently needed at present have declined, such as incense manufacturing in industry, and gold shops, silversmiths, shoe and hat shops, dried and fresh fruit, tea, watches, and silk shops in commerce.

In order to achieve the goal of transforming a consumer city into a production city, the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Government and economic departments have taken many measures to support the development of industry and commerce in the past year. First, banks provided loans of 18.9 billion yuan to state-owned industries and businesses; 56,134,000 yuan to private industry; and 20,835,000 yuan to commerce. This greatly facilitated the capital turnover of public and private industry and commerce. Second, the method of state ordering was adopted to support the development of private industry. For example, state trade signed ordering contracts with more than half of the private cotton textile factories, accepting 21,585 bolts of private plain cloth throughout the year. Even for those who did not sign contracts, appropriate consideration was given to yarn prices and raw yarn supply. For example, the iron industry mostly signed contracts with the state-owned Water Conservancy Promotion Agency, with orders accounting for 2,557 out of the 4,485 waterwheels produced throughout the year (accounting for 57 percent). Third, help was provided to solve the supply of raw materials (such as solving the supply of coal and organizing private factories to purchase iron in the Northeast), and the sales of finished products (such as organizing the knitwear unified sales cooperative). Special attention was paid to key industries, and attention was paid to rewarding improvements in equipment (such as taking care of the modification of power looms in the weaving industry), improving technology, and calling for standardized product quality. Such as grain processing, the agency sales of kerosene, salt, groceries, and other goods, as well as the reduction of industrial electricity charges (from 1.2 catties to 0.9 catties), which shows that the development of private industry and commerce is inseparable from the leadership and support of the national economy. Fourth, in terms of taxation, the spirit of industry being lighter than commerce was basically implemented, and consideration was given to the development of industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Fifth, collective contracts were signed between labor and capital in private industries, and labor-capital relations were properly handled, which promoted the development of industry and commerce. In addition, in some poorly performing industries, workers and shop assistants voluntarily reduced their salaries, which also greatly facilitated the operation of the capitalists.

In the past year, Shijiazhuang City has achieved great success in developing urban industry and commerce, but there are still some shortcomings in implementing the policy of developing production and prospering the economy in its work. For example, the spirit of starting everything from production has not been thoroughly implemented, and there is still a lack of comprehensive organization and planning for the city's production development (the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee has now been established, and this will be improved in the future). In the government's support for private industry, some processing profits are obviously low, the supply of raw materials is not timely enough, and there are more or less biases in the implementation of labor-capital policies. In terms of taxation, there are still imbalances between various industries and regions, or biases of small households squeezing out large households, and large households squeezing out small households, thus forming individual distortions that are too light or too heavy. These should be further improved in this year's continued development of industrial and commercial production.

    银行贷款国家订货是发展的重要因素
    石市一年来工商业发展的规律，已经证明：凡适合于广大人民需要的工业和商业都得到了发展：工业有制造农具的铁工、熟铁、白铁和织布、化工、榨油、建筑、砖瓦等；商业有粮、布、煤、铁货、货栈、杂货、大车店、棉花与油业等。凡不适合于人民需要或目前不急需的工商业则走向衰落，如工业中之造香，商业中之金店、银楼、鞋帽、干鲜、茶叶、钟表、绸缎等。
    为了达到把消费城市变为生产城市的目的，一年来石家庄市人民政府和经济部门对于扶助工商业的发展上，曾经采取了许多措施。首先银行对国营工商业贷款一八九亿元；对私营工业贷款五六、一三四万元；对商业贷款二○、八三五万元，这大大便利了公私工商业的资金周转。第二，采取国家订货的方式，扶助了私营工业的发展，如国家贸易与私营棉织业半数以上厂户，订立了订货合同，全年承收私营白布二一、五八五匹；即未订合同户，在纱价与原纱供给上也予以适当的照顾。又如铁工业与国营水利推进社大都签订了合同，在全年生产水车四、四八五辆中，订货占二、五五七辆之多（占百分之五十七）。第三，帮助解决了原料供给（如解决燃煤供给以及组织私营厂家去东北购铁等），成品推销（如组织针织业统销社），特别抓紧了重点行业，并注意奖励改进装备（如对织布业改装电力机的照顾），提高技术和号召产品质量标准化。如粮食加工，煤油、食盐、杂货等货物的代销，以及工业电费的减低（由一·二斤减为○·九斤），这就说明私营工商业的发展，是与国家经济的领导扶持分不开的。第四，在税收上基本上贯彻了工轻于商的精神，和照顾到有利于国计民生工商业的发展。第五，在私营行业中劳资双方订立了集体合同，正确处理了劳资关系，促进了工商业的发展。此外，在某些营业不佳的行业中，工人店员自动降低薪资，也予资方经营以很大便利。
    一年来石市在发展城市工商业中是获得了很大成绩的，但在工作中贯彻执行发展生产繁荣经济的方针上仍然还存在着一些缺点，如一切从生产出发的精神贯彻不够，对全市生产的发展还缺乏全面的组织性与计划性（现市财政经济委员会业已成立，今后将有所改进）。公家对私营工业的扶植中，某些加工利润显低，原料供应不够及时，和在劳资政策的执行中存在着或多或少的偏向。在税收方面，各个行业间，地区间还存在不够平衡的现象，或小户挤大户，大户挤小户的偏向，因而形成了个别的畸轻畸重。这些都应在今年进一步发展工商业生产中继续改进。
