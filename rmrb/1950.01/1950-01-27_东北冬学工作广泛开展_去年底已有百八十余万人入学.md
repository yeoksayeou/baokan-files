Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 26th: Winter school work has been widely developed in rural areas of Northeast China. According to incomplete statistics from the Education Department of the Northeast People's Government, over 1.8 million people in the region had participated in winter schools by the end of last year. In Liaoxi Province alone, based on statistics from 20 counties and cities, 6,828 relatively formal winter schools and 6,008 groups were established, with over 452,000 students, the vast majority of whom are young and middle-aged people. There are currently over 24,800 winter school teachers, most of whom were recommended from the masses and have undergone some training. According to statistics from 20 cities and counties in Songjiang Province, including Mudanjiang, Jiamusi, and Acheng, there are 5,899 winter schools with over 7,350 teachers and 294,500 students. In Liaodong Province, Haicheng County alone opened over 790 winter school classes and 324 groups in the first ten days of last month, with over 45,000 students, accounting for 19% of the county's young and middle-aged illiterate and semi-literate population. Currently, the province's winter school work is being promoted from points to areas, and it is estimated that 700,000 people will enroll. About 600,000 people in Jilin Province are participating in winter schools this year. In Yushu County, with a population of 650,000, over 137,000 people are attending school, accounting for 21% of the county's population, with Communist Party members, Youth League members, and organized young adults accounting for three-quarters of the total. According to the statistics of required textbooks in Heilongjiang Province, approximately 480,000 people are participating in the study. In Rehe Province, Qinglong County alone has established 600 literacy classes with over 30,000 people attending school. The winter school movement in the suburbs of cities such as Shenyang, Anshan, and Benxi has also become a surge. The learning enthusiasm of the people in various places is very high. For example, in Xinmin and Zhangwu counties in Liaoxi Province and Acheng County in Songjiang Province, farmers participating in winter schools have on average learned 80 to 90 characters and have generally learned to sing the national anthem and understand the significance of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This year, the winter school work in various parts of Northeast China has strengthened organizational leadership, paid attention to combining with production, and adopted methods such as "teaching each other" based on past experience. Party and government leaders in various districts and villages have paid more attention to winter school work this year. For example, Yushu County in Jilin Province listed winter school work as one of the three major tasks in winter (public grain, sideline production, winter school). The Secretary of the Acheng County Party Committee in Songjiang Province personally led and promoted the work, so the winter school work developed smoothly and rapidly. Various places have also emphasized the combination of winter schools with production and various central tasks, meeting the needs and actual conditions of the masses. For example, in Niuzhuang District, Haicheng County, Liaodong Province, while teaching literacy in winter schools, they also studied various sideline production methods, which was warmly welcomed by the students. In Shuangshan and other villages in Jixian County, Songjiang Province, study groups were organized into production groups, going up the mountains to collect firewood during the day and studying together at night. Some winter schools also studied farming methods or invited labor models in the village to report on production experience, which made good preparations for the spring production. Because winter schools are combined with production and various central tasks, the masses are happy to participate, and the winter school organization is more consolidated. At the same time, the study of winter schools also promoted various central tasks. Therefore, work tasks are completed well and quickly in places where there are winter schools. For example, the winter school in Ziqiang Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, studied the grain requisition policy, and the whole village immediately launched a campaign to deliver good grain, resulting in the honorary title of "Grain Requisition Model Village." In addition, various places generally made better preparations before opening winter schools, which is also one of the reasons for the smooth development of winter schools. For example, many places conducted family visits, held mass meetings, elderly forums, and illiteracy grievance meetings, and organized various propaganda teams to mobilize everyone to voluntarily participate in learning, all of which have achieved good results. However, some village cadres in a few counties and districts have the style of forced orders and formalism, do not pay enough attention to winter schools, and the teaching content and methods are not suitable for the needs of the masses. These shortcomings are being corrected by the leading authorities.

    东北冬学工作广泛开展
    去年底已有百八十余万人入学
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】东北农村已经广泛地开展了冬学工作。据东北人民政府教育部不完全统计，截至去年年底止，全区已经有一百八十余万人参加冬学。辽西省仅据二十个县、市的统计，即成立了六千八百二十八处较正规的冬学，六千零八个小组，参加学习的学员达四十五万二千余人，绝大多数是青年和壮年。现有冬学教师二万四千八百余人，基本上是从群众中推选出来的，多数都经过了一定的训练。松江省据牡丹江、佳木斯、阿城等二十个市、县的统计，共有冬学五千八百九十九处，教师七千三百五十余人，学员二十九万四千五百余人。辽东省仅海城县在上月初旬十天中就开办了冬学七百九十余班，三百二十四个小组，共有学员四万五千余人，占全县青年和壮年文盲、半文盲的百分之十九。现该省冬学工作正由点到面地推广中，估计将有七十万人入学，吉林省今年约有六十万人参加冬学，其中仅榆树县六十五万人口中，就有十三万七千余人上学，占全县人口百分之二十一，共产党员、青年团员和有组织的青年壮年则占总数四分之三。黑龙江省据所需教材统计，约有四十八万余人参加学习。热河省仅青龙一县即已经建立六百个识字班，有三万余人上学。沈阳、鞍山、本溪等市市郊的冬学运动也已形成热潮。各地人民群众的学习情绪都很高，如辽西省新民、彰武等县和松江省阿城等县参加冬学的农民平均已识到八、九十个字，并且普遍地学会了唱国歌，知道了中华人民共和国成立的意义等。今年东北各地的冬学工作，都根据过去的经验，加强了组织领导，注意和生产结合，并采取了“以民教民”等方法。各区村的党政负责人对冬学工作今年都较重视。如吉林省榆树县将冬学工作列为冬季三大任务（公粮、副业生产、冬学）之一，松江省阿城县中共县委书记亲自领导、推动，因此冬学工作开展顺利迅速。各地也都强调了冬学与生产和各项中心工作相结合，切合群众要求和实际情况。如辽东省海城县牛庄区在冬学中，一边教识字，一边研究各种副业生产的方法，受到了学员的热烈欢迎。松江省集贤县双山等村并以学习小组编为生产小组，白天上山打柴，晚上一起学习。有些冬学还研究了耕种办法，或请村中劳动模范报告生产经验，为今春大生产作了很好的准备。由于冬学与生产和各项中心工作相结合，群众便乐于参加，冬学组织也就更加巩固。同时通过冬学的学习也推动了各项中心工作，因此经常有冬学的地方，工作任务就完成得好和快。如吉林省蛟河县自强屯的冬学，学习了征粮政策，全屯立刻展开送好粮运动，结果获得了“征粮模范屯”的光荣称号。此外，各地在开办冬学以前，一般都作了较好的准备工作，也是使冬学顺利开展的原因之一。如许多地方进行了家庭访问，召开群众大会、老人座谈会、文盲诉苦会和组织各种宣传队，发动大家自愿参加学习，均收到较好效果。但也有些县区的少数村屯干部存在着强迫命令、形式主义的作风，对冬学不够重视，教学内容、方法都不适合群众要求的现象。这些缺点正由领导机关注意纠正中。
