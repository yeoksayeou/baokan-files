    Shanxi Inspects Winter Production Requirements and Demands Preparations for Spring Plowing
    [This newspaper's Shanxi dispatch] Through in-depth inspection and promotion in Shanxi Province, winter production has been comprehensively launched throughout the province and is moving towards being led, organized, and planned. As prices tend to stabilize, leading organs at all levels have dispatched cadres to conduct in-depth inspections and promotions, and banks have issued large amounts of winter loans. The concrete organization and marketing of cooperatives in various places have gradually changed the spontaneous nature of winter production.
    According to incomplete statistics from fifteen counties in the old and new districts: the income from various sideline productions has already reached 5.57 million catties of millet.
            Fifteen Counties' Sideline Income is 5.57 Million Catties of Millet
    Yangqu and Guo Counties have 14,200 livestock participating in transportation. In Changzhi, Li, and Lu Counties, 83 villages regularly have 2,567 carts for transportation. Cooperatives in 49 villages in Changzhi planned to sell 170,000 catties of hemp skin to their members (selling 200 yuan more per catty than the market price) and collected 1.12 million catties of public grain rice on their behalf. Six counties, including Lingshi, have loaned 760,000 catties of grain and 58.57 million yuan in RMB to support the sideline production of the masses. The concrete leadership of counties, districts, and villages has also been gradually strengthened. Jiexiu County dispatched cadres to personally lead more than 4,000 farmers to contract for railway repair and chop kiln pillars, earning 1.33 million catties of rice in one month. The Communist Party branch of Longfeng Village in the new district led 220 farmers to chop 11,988 kiln pillars in seven days, earning 94,321 catties of rice. The repair and manufacture of agricultural tools has attracted the attention of most areas and achieved results. For example, five counties, including Wuxiang, have repaired and manufactured 44,340 pieces of agricultural tools, of which Wuxiang County alone repaired and manufactured more than 30,000 large and small agricultural tools. Adjusting livestock: According to statistics from Yuchang two special districts, 2,118 heads have been purchased. Wenxi County increased its purchase by 200 heads in one month, of which 114 heads were bought back through cooperative loans, and 86 heads were organized by the masses to buy. For example, 11 villages, including Shangzhuang, organized 407 laborers, 49 carts, and 82 mules to transport wood, earning 2,826 shi of rice, and drawing 901 shi to buy back 63 heads of livestock. This is a model for the concrete implementation of the State Council of the Central People's Government's instruction to "change people raising livestock into livestock raising people." "Relying on the mountains to eat from the mountains, and relying on the roads to eat from the roads" has become the action slogan for concretely implementing the principle of "adapting to local conditions" in various places. For example, the mountainous areas of Chang, Fen, and Yi three special districts mainly develop the coal and iron industry (12 of the 15 counties in Changzhi produce coal and iron, and 8 of the 9 counties in Fenyang produce coal). Xin and Xing two special districts, due to inconvenient transportation, mainly sell local grain and special products (such as the pears of Guo County) in most areas in exchange for cloth, cotton, and daily necessities. Areas close to the Tongpu Railway mainly repair railways, transport sleepers, and temporarily transport goods. Rural areas close to cities organize labor to find work in cities. Other industries such as the straw braid industry in Li and Lu, and the weaving and workshops in Xing County Special District are all developed based on the principle of adapting to local conditions.
            The Spring Festival is Approaching, Preparations for Spring Plowing Should Begin
    The Spring Festival is approaching, and as the saying goes, "After the intercalary month, plowing should be done immediately." Therefore, on the basis of the winter production movement, the following spring plowing preparations must be continued actively:
    1.  Intensifying the repair and manufacture of agricultural tools and increasing the breeding and protection of livestock is a major event related to this year's spring plowing, and must be led in a planned and organized manner. At present, many areas are still stuck in the planning and calling stage. The inspection results of six counties in Changzhi Special District (a total of 1,049 villages) showed that only 30% of the villages were specifically organizing and carrying out these activities. Changzhi, Huguan and other counties recently carried out a major inspection of agricultural tools, putting forward the slogan "make up for what is lacking," which is worthy of emulation by other places. In addition to continuing to purchase livestock as much as possible, spring is approaching, so attention should be paid to cleanliness and hygiene to prevent diseases, improve feeding and management, and protect the health of livestock. In addition to this, special attention should be paid to increasing the number of high-quality breeding stock and expanding breeding, which is the basic way to increase livestock.
    2.  Seriously check winter production loans and continue to complete winter loan tasks. According to local experience, loans that are processed through cooperatives and are actually used appropriately play a significant role in developing production; however, many areas still do not pay attention to this work, or say "this is the bank's task" and let it go. Currently, prices are stable, and farmers are in high spirits to apply for loans in order to develop production. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further in-depth inspections on the basis of inspection work, consolidate the achievements, strengthen the planning of winter production, and bring the movement into balance. In particular, it is more important to inspect the winter production of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers.
    3.  Overcome mechanical views and commanding styles in winter production work, and further improve leadership. For example, some district and village cadres in Changzhi and other places believe that transporting coal and women making shoe soles are not winter production, and only transporting and earning cash rice is production. Similar phenomena also exist in some villages in Fushan and Xinzhou Special Districts. This will not only fail to carry out winter production well, but will also seriously alienate the masses. Therefore, it is still necessary to strengthen the education of district and village cadres on the winter production policy and earnestly overcome biases.
    4.  Emphasize carrying out thrift propaganda and establish the idea of building a family through diligent work and thrift. Various places should use winter schools and other methods to publicize the land policy and the nature of the New Democratic Revolution to the masses in order to dispel the masses' concerns and expose the rumors of special agents, and establish the idea of building a family through diligent work and thrift.

    山西检查冬季生产要求做好春耕准备
    【本报山西讯】山西省经过深入检查推动，全省冬季生产业已较全面的展开，并走向有领导、有组织、有计划。由于物价趋于平稳，各级领导机关抽调干部深入检查推动，和银行大批发放冬季贷款及各地合作社具体组织推销的结果，使冬季生产自流现象逐渐改变。
    据新老区十五个县不完全统计：从各种副业生产中已收入小米五百五十七万斤。
            十五个县副业收入小米五百五十七万斤
    阳曲、崞县参加运输牲口计一万四千二百头，长（治）、黎、潞三县八十三个村经常有二千五百六十七辆大车运输。长治四十九个村合作社有计划的给社员群众推销麻皮十七万斤（每斤比市价多卖二百元），代交公粮米一百一十二万斤。灵石等六县已贷粮七十六万斤，人民币五千八百五十七万元，扶植群众副业生产。县、区、村具体领导，也逐渐加强，介休县抽调干部亲自领导四千余农民包修铁路及砍窑柱，一月内赚米一百三十三万斤。新区龙凤村中共支部领导二百二十个农民七天内砍窑柱一万一千九百八十八根，赚米九万四千三百二十一斤。修制农具已引起大部地区注意，并取得成绩。如武乡等五个县已修制农具四万四千三百四十件，其中武乡一县即修制大小农具三万余件。调剂牲畜：据榆长两专区统计已购回二千一百一十八头，文水县一个月内增购二百头，其中通过合作社贷款买回一百一十四头，组织群众添买八十六头。如上庄等十一个村组织了劳力四百零七个，大车四十九辆，驮骡八十二头，运道木赚米二千八百二十六石，抽出九百零一石买回牲口六十三头。这是具体执行中央人民政府政务院指示的“变人养牲口为牲口养人”的范例。“靠山吃山，靠道吃道”已成为各地具体执行“因地制宜”原则的行动口号。如长、汾、翼三个专区的山地，以发展煤铁业为主（长治十五个县内即有十二个县产煤铁，汾阳九县内有八个县产煤），忻、兴两专区因交通不便大部地区以推销当地粮食与特产（如崞县之梨）换回布匹棉花及日用品等为主，靠近同蒲沿线以修铁路、运枕木及临时运销物资为主。接近城市之农村组织劳力到城市揽脚做活。其他如黎、潞之草帽辫，兴县专区的纺织及作坊等都是本着因地制宜原则发展的。
            春节快到应着手准备春耕
    目前春节迫近，俗话说：“过了闰月年，走马就种田。”因此必须在冬季生产运动的基础上继续积极的做好以下春耕准备工作：
    一、加紧修制农具与增殖保育牲畜是关系今年春耕的一件大事，必须有计划有组织的领导去做。目前仍有不少地区停留在计划号召阶段，长治专区六个县检查结果（共一千零四十九村）只有百分之三十村子在具体组织进行。长治、壶关等县最近进行农具大检查，提出“缺什补什”的口号，值得各地效法；牲畜除尽量继续购买外，现春季即届，应重视清洁卫生预防疾病，改良饲养和管理，保护牲畜的健康。除此应特别重视增加优良种畜，扩大繁殖，这是增加牲畜的基本方法。
    二、认真检查冬季生产贷款并继续完成冬季贷款任务。根据各地经验，贷款经过合作社并确实用的适当，对发展生产起很大作用；但仍有不少地区未重视这一工作，或者说“这是银行的任务”而放手不管。目前物价平稳，农民为了发展生产要求贷款情绪很高，因而必须在检查工作的基础上实行进一步的深入检查，巩固已得成绩，加强冬季生产的计划性，使运动走向平衡，特别对烈军干属的冬季生产检查更为重要。
    三、克服冬季生产工作中的机械观点和命令作风，进一步改善领导。如长治等地有些区村干部认为群众运煤和妇女纳鞋底都不是冬季生产，只有运输赚下现米才是生产。浮山忻县专区有些村也有类似现象。这样将不仅不会搞好冬季生产，反而会严重的脱离了群众，所以还须加强对区村干部的冬季生产方针教育，认真克服偏向。
    四、强调进行节约宣传，树立克勤克俭的生产发家思想。各地应运用冬学等方式向群众宣传土地政策和新民主主义革命性质，以解除群众顾虑和揭穿特务谣言，树立克勤克俭发家致富的思想。
