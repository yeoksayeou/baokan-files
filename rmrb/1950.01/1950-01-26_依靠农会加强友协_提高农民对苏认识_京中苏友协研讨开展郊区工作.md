    Relying on Farmers' Associations to Strengthen Friendship Associations
    Enhancing Farmers' Understanding of the Soviet Union
    Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Discusses Carrying Out Work in Suburban Areas
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association convened a joint meeting of the heads of its eight suburban general branches on the 23rd and 24th to discuss how to carry out the work of the Friendship Association in suburban areas. Ding Xiu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association headquarters, and Pan Defeng, Deputy Director of the Service Department, attended the meeting. On the 23rd, Chai Zemin, Secretary of the Suburban Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke first, pointing out that the work of the suburban Sino-Soviet Friendship Association must be closely integrated with land reform and production, explaining the inseparable significance of the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the central work of the suburbs; and especially pointed out that the responsible persons of the CPC district committees and district governments should uniformly lead this work, and carry out Sino-Soviet friendship education at any time according to the characteristics of the suburbs and the farmers' requirements for science and culture, so that farmers can combine practical examples in the land reform movement to improve their understanding of the Soviet Union. Subsequently, each general branch reported on its work. The work of the 13th District was the best, accounting for 11,360 of the 28,984 members in the entire suburb, and 44 branches were established. On the 24th, in the morning, the discussion continued on how to carry out the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in suburban areas, and each general branch put forward many specific suggestions. Finally, Zeng Ping, the person in charge of the association's executive committee, summarized the meeting. Based on the phenomenon of "tight at first and then loose" and the lack of practicality and initiative in the past work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in suburban areas, he pointed out that future work should go deep into the countryside from the urban and suburban areas, grasp the characteristics of the suburbs, and use winter schools or literacy classes to specifically introduce the Soviet Union's situation to improve farmers' cultural level and scientific knowledge; he also pointed out that the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association must be subordinate to the central work of the suburbs, but the central work of the suburbs must closely take care of the work of the Friendship Association. Ding Xiu, Deputy Secretary-General of the General Association, emphasized that the development of the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should have a core to rely on, such as relying on trade unions in factories, and relying on the organization of farmers' associations in rural areas. In order to strengthen the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in suburban areas, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association decided to hold suburban meetings once a month to regularly discuss the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in suburban areas.

    依靠农会加强友协
    提高农民对苏认识
    京中苏友协研讨开展郊区工作
    【北京讯】北京市中苏友好协会于二十三、二十四两日召集该会所属郊区八个总支会负责人举行联席会议，研讨如何展开郊区友协工作问题。中苏友好协会总会副总干事丁秀，服务部副主任潘德枫等列席。二十三日，首由中共北京市委会郊委会书记柴泽民讲话，他指出郊区中苏友好协会工作须与土地改革和生产密切结合，说明了中苏友好协会工作与郊区中心工作有不可分的意义；并特别指出中共区委、区政府负责人应统一领导这一工作，根据郊区特点与农民对科学文化的要求，随时进行中苏友好的教育，使农民在土地改革运动中结合实际事例，提高农民对苏联的认识。继由各总支会汇报工作，其中以十三区的工作成绩最好，在整个郊区二万八千九百八十四个会员中，该区会员即占一万一千三百六十人，建立了四十四个支会。二十四日，上午继续讨论郊区中苏友好协会工作如何展开问题，各总支会均提出了很多具体意见。最后由该会干事会负责人曾平总结，他根据郊区过去中苏友好协会工作所发生“先紧后松”及不踏实、不主动的现象，指出：今后工作应由城关城厢深入到农村中去，掌握郊区的特点，利用冬学或识字班具体地介绍苏联情况，以提高农民文化水平与科学知识；他并指出中苏友好协会工作须服从郊区中心工作，但郊区中心工作又须紧密照顾友协工作。总会丁秀副总干事强调了中苏友好协会工作的发展应有依靠的核心，如在工厂依靠工会，在农村则应依靠农会的组织。北京市中苏友好协会为加强郊区中苏友好协会工作，决定每月召开郊区会议一次，经常研讨郊区中苏友好协会的工作问题。
