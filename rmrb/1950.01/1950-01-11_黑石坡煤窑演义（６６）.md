    The Black Rock Slope Coal Mine Chronicle (66)
    Kang Tuo

    Old Yin had been thinking about Xi Lu’s situation these past few days. He knew that Xi Lu was indeed in difficulty, and the mine, being something that neither the public nor private sectors had the strength to manage, had been stirred up by the workers. If Xi Lu were given too large a share in the mine that the workers had agitated for, it wouldn’t be fair. The key to everything lay in developing production, and mishandling the situation might even affect the workers’ enthusiasm for production! Starting from this practical situation and after discussing it with the higher-ups, Old Yin launched a final discussion in the village. It was decided to give Xi Lu a certain share based on his land and past management. All the village's labor, cash, and Xi Lu's contributions were collectively converted into one thousand shares, with Xi Lu holding eighty shares, thus forming a coal mine production cooperative. Rural handicraft industries like this one had been greatly destroyed by the Japanese invaders and Yan Xishan. In the early days after liberation, neither the public nor private sectors had the strength to restore them. The workers spontaneously organized to develop production and solve their livelihoods. Many such cooperatives emerged in Yangquan at the time, especially ironworks. This was a vivid historical period! It should be said that rural handicraft industries, unlike urban machine industries, were well-suited to cooperative production! At that time, it was just an experiment, the workers doing it themselves. The Black Rock Slope Coal Mine was doing pretty well, so they should just keep going! What would happen in the future would depend on their efforts.

    Let’s return to the coal mine. After determining the cooperative shares at the Black Rock Slope Coal Mine, eleven shareholder representatives were elected to form a coal mine production cooperative committee. The leaders and managers of all aspects of the mine remained unchanged. Regarding the mine's regulations, Xi Lu proposed changing the fixed capital into "open-book management," allowing the heading leaders to find their own teams of diggers and carriers, contracting them to dig a heading, paying them a certain amount for each day's coal output, and letting them discuss and decide how to distribute the earnings among themselves; after trying this proposal for a few days, everyone indeed competed to dig more, their enthusiasm was high, and coal output increased, so the method was adopted and immediately implemented. In addition, because the mine's sales yard business was growing day by day, Xi Lu was assigned to manage the sales yard. He was exceptionally skilled with the abacus. Sometimes a village would come to buy several thousand catties of coal, requiring dozens of weighings. After weighing and totaling the accounts, people would quickly call out the weight of each scale: "Eighty-four, seventy-five, one hundred and three, ninety-six..." Without even touching the abacus, he would simply say "Um" and nod his head at each number, virtually moving his fingers on his trouser leg, and by the time they finished calling out the numbers, he would have the total, causing the onlookers to laugh in amusement.

    Furthermore, for everyone's convenience, a supply and marketing cooperative was established in the mine's office. Shuan Cheng and Xi Lu even made a trip to Huolu to buy back some cloth, salt, matches, kerosene, alkali, towels, paper, pens... which were much cheaper than buying them in Yangquan. At the same time, the mine's income was often converted into grain, and the miners could freely draw supplies in kind at the set price, which everyone praised.

    Leaving aside the matters of Da San and the Bai Quan family, when Shuan Cheng and Xi Lu went to Huolu, they brought back many clothes and supplies for them. The two formally exchanged gifts: Da San's gift, among other things, included his white silk trousers; Bai Quan's family's gift, among other things, included an old white porcelain teapot, which she had used for many years while serving Ju Bao's wife, and which she had picked out and taken back during the distribution of fruits.

    In mid-April, the village's apricot blossoms were blooming beautifully, and Da San and the Bai Quan family got married at this time. The whole village congratulated them, and Old Bai even came to help with the arrangements for a while; Old Yin had originally planned to return to Huada to finish his work, but the people insisted on him staying, so he stayed for two more days. Seeing such a joyous event in the village where he had worked for more than half a year, he couldn't help but feel happy and said to Old Bai: "You must be very happy to see your old comrade getting married!" Old Bai said: "That goes without saying! Old Yin, let me tell you some news: Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu are now connected, and the higher-ups have decided to merge the two border regions to form the North China Liberated Area; we have achieved such great victories and liberated so many cities, that industry will become more and more important. The situation dictates that we designate Yangquan as a specialized industrial and mining city. I'm planning to transfer Da San to a large mine for proper training, and as for this mine in the village, as long as the leadership keeps a close eye on it and has Tian Lu, it will be fine. Do you agree?" Old Yin was unspeakably happy and quickly said: "Good! Old Bai, I think I will also work in industry in the future, I want to request to go south and learn to work in industry!" Old Bai said: "That's great! Old Yin, this earthen kiln is nothing, there will be many large industries in the city! Work hard!" As he spoke, the two laughed, and enthusiastically chatted for a long time, exchanging many ideas. That night, the two slept on the same kang and talked half the night, one saying he would learn from the workers, the other saying he would improve his education, one saying he would exercise to strengthen his position, the other saying he would change his temper, learn to make plans and set rules for his work... the two were so enthusiastic, it was truly the first time since they had met! The next day, they both got drunk at Da San's wedding feast, and it wasn't until the third day that they left Black Rock Slope Village together.

    黑石坡煤窑演义（６６）
    康濯
    老尹这些天来一直在想着喜禄的事。他知道喜禄的确是困难，而且窑也就是公私都没力量，由大伙工人闹起来的，如若把大伙闹成的窑给喜禄的股份太大，也就是说不过。一切关键在发展生产，处理不恰当的话，还怕影响工人们生产的劲头哩！老尹从当时这实际情况出发，又跟上边研究了一下，就发动村里最后讨论，决定了还是给喜禄的地盘和过去的经营算一定的股，全村劳力、现洋和喜禄的共折成一千股，喜禄有八十股，这样组成煤窑生产合作社。像这样的农村手工业，被日寇和阎锡山大大摧毁了，刚解放以后，公私两方的确都没力量恢复，工人们自动组织起来，发展了生产，解决了生活，这种合作社在当时的阳泉闹起来很多，特别是铁炉更多，这是一段活生生的历史！应该说：农村手工业不同于城市的机器工业，组织合作生产是很好的！当时还只是实验着作，只是工人自己起来作着，像黑石坡煤窑这样，作得还不赖，那就好好作下去吧！以后怎么样，看以后的努力好了。
    这里再回到煤窑上来。却说黑石坡煤窑确定了合作的股子以后，窑上扩大选了十一个股东代表，组成了煤窑生产合作委员会，领导的人和窑上各方面的经管人都没变。窑上的规章，喜禄提出改变硬资，作“开账营生”，让领岔的自己找一班刨头担头，自己包一道岔刨，一天出多少炭给多少钱，再订出章程由他们自己讨论分配谁该分多分少；这提议试吧了几天，果然大家都争着多刨，劲头大，出炭多，就通过了这个办法，立时实行了。此外，因为窑上卖场里的营生一天比一天多，喜禄就拨到了卖场上管事，他算盘子利索的不行，有时一个村来闹好几千斤炭，挂好几十秤，赶挂完一总算账，人家给他飞快地报着每一秤的数目道：“八十四、七十五、一百零三、九十六……”他连算盘也不拨，只听一个数目“嗯”一声点一下脑袋，并使手指头在裤脚上虚拨一下，赶人家报完，他的总数也就出来了，直闹得围着看稀罕的人们笑个不停。
    再有窑上柜房里为了大家的方便，成立了一个供销合作社，拴成和喜禄还下了趟获鹿，买回些布匹、咸盐、洋火、白油、碱面、毛巾、纸、笔……比从阳泉买贱得多；同时窑上收入又经常折变成粮食，窑黑们领供应可以随便按价领实物，大家都很称赞这件事。
    丢下大三和白泉家的事，在拴成喜禄去获鹿的时候，给他二人捎回了不少穿的用的，他二人就正式换了礼物：大三的礼物，除了别的，还有他那条白绸裤；白泉家的礼物，除了别的，还有一把旧白细磁茶壶，这就是他多年侍候聚宝女人用的那把，分果实的时候，她又挑着领回了。
    四月半，村里的杏花正开得挺好，大三和白泉家就在这时候结了婚。浑村人都给他们贺喜，老白也跑来张罗了一阵；老尹本要回华大结束工作，但人们硬留他，他也就多呆了两天。他看着自己工作了半年多的村里，有这么一件喜事，不免也高高兴兴，并对老白说：“你看着你这老伙计结婚，准也挺欢喜吧！”老白道：“那还用说！老尹，告你个消息：咱晋察冀跟晋冀鲁豫如今连成了一片，上级决定两边区合并成立华北解放区；咱们胜利又这么大，城市解放那么些，往后工业的事也一天比一天重要，这地势决定划归阳泉市，把阳泉闹成个专门的工矿市。我还许要到阳泉作工人工作，那时我计划把大三调到大矿上去好好培养，村里这窑，只要领导上抓紧帮助，有天禄也就行了。你同意不？”老尹说不出的高兴，忙道：“好！老白，我看我往后也作工人工作，我要求南下，学习作工人工作去！”老白说：“那很好嘛！老尹，这土窑算不了什么，往后进了城市，大工业多的是哩！好好干吧！”说着，二人都笑了，并劲头足足地又扯了一大会，还互相提了很多意见。黑夜，二人睡在一条炕上，又捣拉了半宿，这个说要好好向工人学习，那个说要好好提高文化，这个说要锻炼着更站稳立场，那个说要改改脾气，作工作学着作计划定规章……二人说得那么热火，真是认识以来的头一回！第二天，他俩喝大三的喜酒又都喝了个大醉，直到第三天，才相跟着离开黑石坡村。
