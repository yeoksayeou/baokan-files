    Shandong Branch Direct Organs Cadres
    Begin Studying Social Development History

    [This newspaper reports] The cadres of the direct organs of the Shandong Branch of the CCP Central Committee have begun to study A Brief History of Social Development. More than 900 cadres gathered on the 8th to listen to a report by Li Jingchun, deputy director of the Policy Research Office, on studying A Brief History of Social Development. The report explained that the purpose and requirements of studying A Brief History of Social Development are: to recognize that labor creates the world and that the working people are the masters of society; to recognize class struggle and establish a historical materialist viewpoint; to understand the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state and establish a correct concept of the state. The specific method of learning is to combine theory with practice. In the learning process, it is necessary to connect with specific thoughts, understanding, and work, emphasizing repeated study, taking study notes, and checking learning effectiveness. At the same time, we must always pay attention to preventing undesirable tendencies such as being superficial, aiming too high, and only delving into terminology. Each general branch and branch should regard leading the study as one of the regular central tasks, and maintain close contact with the responsible comrades of various departments to coordinate and promote the study. The cadres of the Propaganda Department, the Policy Research Office, and the Party Committee of the direct organs of the Branch Bureau are currently studying Ai Siqi's "Starting from the Beginning" and "Methods of Studying Social Development History" as preparation for studying Social Development History and other theoretical books.
