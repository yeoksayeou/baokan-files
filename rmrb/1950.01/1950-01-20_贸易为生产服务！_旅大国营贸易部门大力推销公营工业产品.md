    Trade Serves Production!
    The Lushun-Dalian State-Owned Trading Department Vigorously Promotes Public Industrial Products
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Public enterprises such as Dalian Trading Company, Guandong Department Store, and Grain and Fuel Company, adhering to the business policy of "commerce serving industry and trade serving production" last year, vigorously promoted public industrial products and assisted the government in stabilizing prices. All businesses have achieved results over the year. On the issue of stabilizing prices, since its opening on January 15, the department store has priced all items at 5% to 15% lower than the prevailing market prices, thus stabilizing overall prices. In May, prices once fluctuated due to rumors spread by saboteurs; the company promptly cooperated with other relevant departments to sell goods in large quantities at the original prices, immediately restoring price stability. In August and October, the Grain and Fuel Company also effectively curbed two grain price fluctuations. This not only played a safeguarding role in production and construction, but also ensured the stability of the people's lives. In terms of promoting public industrial products, since the division of labor between the Industry and Commerce Bureaus in the second half of the year, which clarified the policy of commerce serving industry, it has also played a significant role. Taking the department store's third-quarter purchases as an example, industrial bureau products accounted for 84.07% of the total purchases; private industry accounted for 5.8%; other accounted for 5.74%; Hong Kong goods accounted for 3.27%; and affiliated factory products accounted for 1.12%. In terms of sales, the shortcoming of insufficient attention to cooperatives in the first half of the year was also corrected, and cooperatives began to be vigorously supported. This not only united the cooperatives around the state-owned economy and developed the cooperative economy, but also enabled the company's business to achieve greater development. It promoted the monthly increase in turnover in the second half of the year; for example, if July is taken as 100, August increased to 934, September was 5,085, and October increased even further to 5,297. As a result, the company completed 99.46% of its third-quarter sales plan. Since its opening in July of this year, the Grain and Fuel Company has also vigorously supported the development of various cooperative economies and regulated grain prices in a planned manner. In terms of turnover, sales through cooperatives alone accounted for 37.5% of the total sales of the Fuel Company. In addition, great achievements have also been made in supporting private industries that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. Since September, Dalian Trading Company has focused on signing processing and purchasing contracts with private industries. For example, the private Jianye Nail Factory has produced more than 100 tons of wire nails for the company in three months, timely supplying the needs of exports and exchanging them for the materials or industrial raw materials needed in the area.

    贸易为生产服务！
    旅大国营贸易部门大力推销公营工业产品
    【本报讯】大连贸易公司、关东百货公司、粮谷燃料公司等公营企业，去年本着“商业为工业服务，贸易为生产服务”的经营方针，大力推销公营工业产品，并协助政府稳定物价，一年来各项业务均获得成绩。在稳定物价问题上，百货公司自一月十五日开业以来，各种物品定价均按当时市价降低百分之五到十五，因而稳定了整个物价。在五月间，物价曾一度因破坏分子造谣而引起波动；该公司及时配合其他有关部门，照原价大量抛售货物，立时使物价回复平稳。八月和十月两个月中，粮谷燃料公司也有效的制止了两次粮价波动。这样不仅对生产建设起了保障作用，同时也保证了人民生活的安定。在推销公营工业产品方面，自下半年工商两厅分工，明确商业为工业服务的方针后，亦曾起了很大作用。以百货公司第三季进货为例，工业厅产品即占进货总额百分之八四·○七；私营工业占百分之五·八；其他占百分之五·七四；香港货占百分之三·二七；附属工厂产品占百分之一·一二。在销货方面也改正了上半年对合作社重视不够的缺点，开始大力扶助合作社。这样不但使合作社团结在国营经济的周围，发展了合作经济，同时也使该公司的营业获得了更大的发展。推动下半年营业额逐月上升；如以七月份作为一○○，而八月份即增为九三四，九月份为五、○八五，十月份更增到五、二九七。因之使该公司第三季推销计划任务，完成了百分之九九·四六。粮谷燃料公司自今年七月份开业后，也有力的扶助了各合作经济的发展，有计划的调剂了粮价。在营业额上仅经合作社销售的即占燃料公司总销额的百分之三七·五。另外，在扶助有利于国民生计的私营工业方面，亦做出很大成绩。大连贸易公司自九月份起，即有重点地和私营工业订立加工和收购合同，例如私营建业制钉工厂，三个月间即已代该公司做了一百多吨洋钉，及时供应了出口的需要，换回了该区所需的物资或工业原料。
