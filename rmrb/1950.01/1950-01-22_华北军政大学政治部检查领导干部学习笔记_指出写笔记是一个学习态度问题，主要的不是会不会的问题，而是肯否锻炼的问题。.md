[Special Dispatch] The Political Department of North China Military and Political University inspected the study notes of responsible personnel from the general team, brigade, and directly affiliated units at the beginning of this month and announced the results. The Political Department believes that among the nineteen responsible personnel, excluding five who did not take notes due to illness or other reasons, the notes of Jia Ke, political commissar of the First Brigade of the Cadre General Team, and five others were the best, and the progress of Gao Xiufeng, deputy minister of the Ministry of Health, was the fastest. The characteristics of these people's notes are: they carefully analyzed the spirit of the principles they learned and criticized their own thinking in connection with these principles. This method is good because it can help us more vividly, specifically, and flexibly understand and grasp these principles, apply these principles, and give play to the combat effectiveness of theory. Secondly, these people's notes are meticulous. This method can help us systematically, comprehensively, and conscientiously observe and understand problems, and exercise our own way of thinking.

The Political Department wrote: Facts have proved that taking notes is not a question of whether one knows how or is able to, but whether one is willing to and has the determination to practice. For example, Gao Xiufeng, deputy minister of the Ministry of Health, does not have a high level of education, but his notes have shown obvious progress and are rich in content; however, some responsible personnel, who are not poorly educated, have only scattered or intermittent notes.

Regarding the role of notes in learning, the Political Department pointed out: Taking notes is a very important learning method and step. The quality of notes is an important indicator of learning attitude and performance. The Political Department pointed out that some people adopt a perfunctory attitude towards taking notes, indicating that they have not been able to study seriously or are not learning effectively. The basic reason for this phenomenon is that they have not truly realized the importance of learning and lack the necessary awareness and persistence in learning. This shows that the basic attitude towards learning is not correct. This attitude is even more inappropriate and unacceptable for personnel responsible for leading work. However, the Political Department wrote: It is not to say that these leading personnel have no understanding of the importance of learning at all. They have begun to realize that they need to learn, but they only hope to learn well without effort, believing that as long as they flip through a book and read it twice, any problem can be solved. In fact, this is impossible. Therefore, they waver on the learning front and lack confidence and determination.

The Political Department reminded everyone: We must remember Marx's admonition: "Let the reader who is thirsting for truth take notice that there is no smooth road in science, and only those who climb with tireless labour and fearless obstacles can hope to reach the shining summit." Marx criticized an erroneous learning attitude, saying: "The French public is often impatient and eager for conclusions; they are eager to know the relationship between general principles and the issues that directly concern them." This impatience, which only hopes to know the general principles and then wants to solve all the practical problems of concern without specific and serious research, is the basic reason for our failure to persevere in learning and our frequent discouragement. To overcome this phenomenon, in addition to the Party committee, political organs, and cadre education departments strengthening guidance on theory and learning methods, it is necessary for every comrade to truly recognize the importance of learning, recognize that being eager for quick results is impossible, recognize the difficulty of learning, and make a determination to learn. In this way, we will definitely achieve results.

    华北军政大学政治部检查领导干部学习笔记
    指出写笔记是一个学习态度问题，主要的不是会不会的问题，而是肯否锻炼的问题。
    【本报特讯】华北军政大学政治部本月初曾将总队、大队以及直属各单位负责人员的学习笔记作了检查，并将检查结果公布。政治部认为，在十九个负责人员中，除因病因故未写笔记者五人外，以干部总队一大队政委贾克等六人的笔记最好，以卫生部副部长高秀峰的笔记进步最快。这些人员的笔记的特点是：较仔细地分析了所学的原则的精神，并以这些原则联系思想进行了批判，这种方法是好的，它可以帮助我们更加生动具体灵活的了解与掌握这些原则，运用这些原则，发挥理论的战斗性。其次，这些人员的笔记是细致的，这种方法可以帮助我们系统的全面的认真的观察与认识问题，锻炼自己的思想方法。
    政治部写道：事实证明作笔记并不是会不会或能不能的问题，而是肯不肯作，有没有决心锻炼的问题。如卫生部副部长高秀峰的文化程度并不高，但他的笔记却有显然的进步，而且内容丰富；但有的负责人员，文化程度并不低，其所作笔记却是零零散散，或时有时无的。
    对于笔记在学习中的作用，政治部指出：笔记是一种很重要的学习方法和步骤，笔记作得好坏，是检查学习态度和成绩的重要标志。政治部指出，有人对写笔记采取应付态度，说明他们还没有能认真学习，或学习不得法。这种现象发生的基本原因是还没有真正认识到学习的重要，对学习缺乏应有的自觉性与坚持性，这说明学习的基本态度还不正确。这种态度对负责领导工作的人员来说，则更是不应有也不能容许的。但是，政治部写道：也不是说这些领导人员对学习的重要一点也没认识。他们已经开始认识到自己需要学习，不过只是希望不费力气地学好，只要把书一翻，看两遍，就什么问题也可以解决。事实上，这是不可能的。于是他们就在学习战线上动动摇摇，缺乏信心和决心了。
    政治部指醒大家说：我们必须牢记马克思的嘱言：“请渴求真理的读者注意，在科学上面是没有平安的大路可走的，只有那在攀登上不畏劳苦，不畏险阻的人，有希望攀登到光辉的顶点。”马克思批评了一种错误的学习态度说：“法国公众常常是没有耐心，急求结论的，他们渴望知道一般原则和他们所直接关心的问题的关系。”这种只希望知道一般原则之后，不去具体认真研究，就想解决一切自己所关心的实际问题的急性病，正是造成我们在学习上不能坚持，常常灰心的基本原因。要克服这种现象，除党委政治机关和干部教育部门加强理论与学习方法上的指导外，就要求每一个同志真正认识到学习的重要，认识急于求成是不可能的，认识学习的困难，下决心去学，如此，就一定可以获得效果。
