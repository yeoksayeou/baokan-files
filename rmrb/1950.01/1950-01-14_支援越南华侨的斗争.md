Short Commentary

    The bloody crimes reported by the Presidium of the First Joint Conference of the Overseas Chinese Association in the ten northern provinces of Vietnam, concerning the persecution of our overseas Chinese by the French troops in northern Vietnam last November, have once again aroused the anger of the Chinese people. We firmly demand that the French authorities in Vietnam punish the murderers, compensate all the losses of the victimized compatriots, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again in the future.
    The atrocities of the French authorities in Vietnam against overseas Chinese remind us of the French authorities' act of sheltering and harboring remnants of the Kuomintang bandits who fled into Vietnam. Although the French government verbally claimed to have disarmed and detained the bandit troops who fled into Vietnam, in reality, they are carrying out a conspiracy to incorporate them into the army of Bảo Đại and send them to Hainan Island. The French authorities neither refused their entry into Vietnam in the first place, nor handed them over to the Chinese People's Liberation Army afterward. This behavior, like the atrocities of the French troops in northern Vietnam, demonstrates the hostility of the French imperialists towards the Chinese people. We must warn the French imperialists that such hostility will inevitably lead them to suffer the consequences. Now is the era when the interests of the Chinese people must be respected. Whoever does not recognize this will inevitably suffer. The French government obviously has not yet recognized this. If the French government does not quickly change its attitude towards the new Chinese government and overseas Chinese, then let's wait and see!

    支援越南华侨的斗争
    越南北部十省华侨理事会第一次联席会议主席团所告发的越南北部法军去年十一月迫害我侨胞的血腥罪行，又一次激起了中国人民的愤怒。我们坚决要求越南法国当局实行惩办凶手，赔偿受难同胞的一切损失，并保证以后不再有同样的事件发生。
    越南法国当局对于华侨的暴行，使我们联想到法国当局掩护收留国民党残匪进入越南的行为。法国政府对于逃入越南的匪军，虽然口头上说是已将他们缴械拘留，但实际上却在进行着把他们分别编入保大军队和送往海南岛的阴谋。法国当局既不拒绝他们进入越南于先，又不将他们送交中国人民解放军于后，这种行为，和越北法军暴行同样表示法国帝国主义者对于中国人民的敌意。我们不能不警告法国帝国主义者，这种敌意必将使他们自食其果。现在是中国人民的利益必须受尊重的时代了，谁不认识这一点，谁就必然要倒霉。法国政府现在显然是还没有这个认识的。如果法国政府不赶快转变自己对于新中国政府和华侨的态度，那末，就让我们等着瞧吧！
