    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 2nd dispatch: TASS Moscow, January 1st dispatch: The Kremlin chimes rang twelve times, echoing through the Moscow sky, marking the beginning of the new year in the Stalin era. These resounding chimes were broadcast by radio to the shores of the Pacific, to the villages of the Kazakhstan steppes, and to the mountain villages of the Pamirs. Millions of Soviet people, along with the residents of Moscow, raised the first glass of the New Year to the one who brought a happy life to the Soviet people, to the beacon for all of humanity, to their friend and leader – their beloved Stalin.
    On this New Year's Eve, Moscow was incomparably beautiful. Under countless lights and a bright moon, the snowflakes sparkled. The snow crunched under the feet of pedestrians and the wheels of cars. The snow covered the streets, squares, and trees in the parks, adding a fairytale charm to the iron pillars of the Moscow bridges and the railings of the boulevards. Just an hour ago, Moscow's streets were crowded with people, rushing to clubs and cultural palaces, to hotels, and to the homes of friends. Esteemed academicians, young workers, students, and artists, doctors and engineers – of different ages and professions, all welcomed the New Year together with friends tonight, toasting the Soviet motherland, its outstanding people, and those who advanced Soviet culture and science. Everywhere there was joy and celebration. Everywhere music could be heard. Emotional Russian songs resonated in the winter air.
    Hundreds of thousands of fir trees, transported from the forests around Moscow, now adorn homes, clubs, cultural palaces, and squares. In the workers' clubs, the New Year's dances were in full swing. The newly established cultural palace of the Ball Bearing Factory, the cultural palace of the Stalin Automobile Factory, and other clubs in Moscow held New Year's parties, where everyone danced merrily.
    In 1949, the personnel of many factories and plants in Moscow had already completed the entire Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and were already producing goods according to the 1951 plan. Every day and every hour of the past year was filled with the constructive labor of the Soviet people for the benefit of their country. The past year was a year of further development of the Soviet Union and a new upsurge in the creativity of the Soviet people. The Soviet people entered 1950 with confidence in the victory of the great cause of communism.

    斯大林时代新的一年开始了  全苏人民为伟大领袖干杯
    莫斯科到处是热情洋溢的歌唱，到处都在翩翩起舞。人们忙着为苏维埃祖国干杯。
    【新华社北京二日电】塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：克里姆林宫的钟声，整整地敲了十二响，钟声在莫斯科上空回旋缭绕，开始了斯大林时代新的一年。这些嘹亮的钟声，由无线电播送到太平洋的岸边，播送到哈萨克斯坦草原的乡村和帕米尔的山庄。千百万苏联人民和莫斯科居民一起，为那一位给苏联人民带来幸福生活的人，为全世界所有人类的灯塔的那个人，为他们的朋友与领袖——挚爱的斯大林而畅干新年的第一杯酒。
    在这个大年之夜，莫斯科是无比的幽美。在无数灯光与明亮的月色之下，雪花闪烁放光。积雪在行人脚下、在汽车轮子下吱吱作响。雪花罩在街道、广场与公园的树木上，使莫斯科桥上的铁柱和林荫路上的栏杆增加了神仙故事般的魅力。一个钟头以前，莫斯科的街道正拥挤着行人，因为人们都忙着上俱乐部和文化宫去，忙着上酒店和朋友们的家去。可敬的科学院院士，年青的工人、学生和艺术家，医生和工程师——包括了不同的年龄与相异的职业，今夜都和朋友们一起共迎新年，将为苏维埃祖国，为她的优秀人民，为那些推进苏联文化与科学的人们干杯。到处都是欢欣作乐。到处都听到音乐声。洋溢着感情的俄罗斯歌曲，在隆冬的空气中荡漾。
    从莫斯科周围的树林里运来的几十万棵枞树，现在正装饰着各户人家、各俱乐部、各文化宫和各广场。各工人俱乐部里，新年舞会上大家舞兴正浓。球轴承制造厂新设的文化宫、斯大林汽车厂的文化宫及莫斯科的其他俱乐部，都举行了新年同乐会，到处都在翩翩起舞。
    一九四九年中，莫斯科许多制造厂和工厂的人员，早已先期完成了整个五年计划，早就按照一九五一年的计划生产着物品。过去一年中，每一天每一点钟都充满着苏联人民为他们国家的利益而从事的建设性劳动。过去的一年，是苏联进一步发展和苏联人民创造力新高涨的一年。苏联人民怀着对共产主义伟大事业的胜利的信心进入了一九五○年。
