    Summary of One Year of Study
    Feng Youlan
    It has been a year since the liberation of Beijing. In this year, China has undergone earth-shaking changes. Society is being transformed and progressing every day. Everyone is also being transformed and progressing. Looking back and examining my own learning experience this year, I feel that I have made some progress, which is that I have begun to realize my previous lack of progress.

    About a month ago, someone from Henan talked about a place where land reform had not yet been implemented. Some people still lived quite comfortably without doing anything. I felt very unfair in my heart. Later, I thought that this was probably the beginning of changing my position. I remember that in the winter of 1944, I returned to my hometown from Kunming because of my mother's funeral. (I hadn't been back to my hometown for over twenty years.) I saw that the lifestyles of those landlord relatives and friends had basically not changed from twenty years ago. The meaning of these lifestyles can be traced back to before the Qin and Han dynasties. It was from that time that I truly understood the feudal nature of Chinese villages. Although the living standards of those landlords had declined due to the war, they still lived without labor, enjoying the fruits of others' work. But at that time, I didn't feel any injustice. It can be seen that at that time, although I had been living on teaching salaries for more than twenty years, because of my background, my emotions were still inclined towards the landlord class.

    Before liberation, I didn't know about the concept of class emotions. Later I learned about it and believed that a person must have genuine feelings for a certain class before he can stand in that class's position. Although I used to think that I was not unenlightened in terms of knowledge, and at one point even thought I was "left-leaning," my true feelings were still inclined towards the landlord class. This determined my previous position.

    This position determined my actions. During the Anti-Japanese War, when the Kuomintang tried to co-opt me, it made me unable to refuse decisively, and instead adopt what I thought was a non-committal attitude, thinking that I was not talking about politics, only doing academics for the sake of academics, and education for the sake of education. Looking at it now, these are all self-deceiving statements. In fact, "not leaving" is "approaching." In the revolutionary period after the Anti-Japanese War, I tried my best to correct my previous wrong path, but there was no decisive action. This, of course, was also determined by the position mentioned above.

    More than a month ago, in a philosophical society, everyone talked about how, when a society reaches a point where it has to change, people who are unwilling to change always want to grasp onto something in their thinking as a sustenance. In the United States, the neo-Thomist school of Catholicism is very popular, which is a manifestation of this. At that time, I suddenly realized my previous position in the Chinese ideological front. During the Anti-Japanese War, wasn't the book I wrote on Neo-Confucianism quite popular? All my books had the word "new" in their titles. Looking at it now, the so-called "new" is only said within the circle of old Chinese philosophy. What I used to talk about as Neo-Confucianism can be said to be a last glow of old Chinese philosophy. Just like the Western neo-Thomist school is a last glow of Western medieval philosophy. Although it is a last glow, in terms of its social impact, it can serve as a sustenance for people who are unwilling to change. Therefore, its social impact hinders revolution.

    I have recently understood that truth, viewed as a system of thought, is alive. It can also vary its application at any time and in any place, and it is the truth at that time and in that place. It is also developing; its life is its development. When I truly understood this principle, I suddenly felt a sense of being in the air without anything to rely on. This feeling proves that my previous habits of thought made me always want to have something eternal and unchanging to rely on. Although I admit that concrete things change, the reason why I rarely talked about concrete things is precisely because I was afraid to face change. This, of course, goes back to the issue of position mentioned above. The reason why I could write books as a sustenance for those who are unwilling to change is precisely because, although I said in knowledge that I was not afraid of change, emotionally I was also a person who was unwilling to change. Therefore, my "writing and establishing theories" not only hindered my own progress, but also hindered the progress of some others.

    Others must have already seen the above situation very clearly, and some have made such comments. But in the past, I always thought that I was above classes, and my thoughts were also above classes. I thought that such comments were not worth refuting. In the spring of this year, a comrade in the Communist Party said to me: "You study philosophy, so it is not easy to feel that the world is changing." At that time, I felt very disapproving in my heart. Because I thought that in my previous writings, there were many places where I talked about change. Looking at it now, these criticisms are all correct. Before the liberation of Beijing, I had already prepared not to leave, but to wait for the change. Since I decided not to leave, I didn't read any more Communist Party books and documents as intellectual preparation. Looking at it now, this is very strange. This, of course, is still the psychology of being unwilling to change at play.

    I didn't know that the Communist Party had methods of criticism and self-criticism before. When liberation first came, although I knew there was this method, I didn't understand why this method was a revolutionary weapon. Later, I participated in several Communist Party membership and probationary membership meetings, and I saw that before a member joined the party, he must first repeatedly undergo criticism and self-criticism in front of the masses. Only in this way can he avoid bringing his "old stains" into the party. In recent months, I have also tried to do a little self-criticism, and I feel that this work is endless. People in the past said that proofreading books is like sweeping fallen leaves, sweeping layer after layer. People's mistakes are really like typos in books, no matter when you look, there are always some there. But sweeping the fallen leaves once opens up the view once. It's like "the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no way out, but the willows are dark and the flowers are bright, and there is another village."

    Before the summer vacation, two students from the Tsinghua Philosophy Department participated in the Southbound Work Group. One day they heard that I was going to do self-criticism. They were very happy and didn't sleep all night, discussing how to give me their opinions. The next day they came, and after talking, they realized that I was going to write an article "on" self-criticism, and not "do" self-criticism. Their opinions were not put forward and were taken back intact. This is what one of the students told me in a recent letter. It can be seen that I must have had an unconscious attitude of "rejecting people thousands of miles away" before. Although I thought I was very humble, in reality I was very arrogant. Looking at it now, it is very ridiculous for a person not to "do" self-criticism, but to specialize in "discussing" self-criticism. Without using the work of self-criticism, how can you discuss self-criticism well?

    My view of philosophy has also changed. In the past, I thought that philosophy did not have a direct relationship with politics and society. The further away it was from this relationship, the more "pure" it was. It also had to have a purely theoretical system. The more "detailed" its theory, the more "specialized" it was. Because I had this view, I always felt that, from a philosophical point of view, Marxism-Leninism's theory was not "specialized" enough, and its relationship with politics and society was too close, not "pure" enough. Now I feel that this is a narrow-minded view. The changes in society have made me break out of the narrow view. Now I feel that the main task of philosophy is to transform people and transform the world. Therefore, it must be applied to politics and society. It does not need thick books of theoretical debate to prove its theory. Too much debate can make people treat it as a language, writing, or knowledge, thus "lingering" and neglecting practice.

    In the spring of this year, I had planned to write several articles to "develop" Marxism-Leninism. Looking at it now, this plan was also wrong. How can I write articles with just a little superficial knowledge from books? Moreover, Marxism-Leninism is a "guide to action" and should be applied to criticizing and solving social problems, and applied to self-criticism. If there are gains in these applications, then it is a true development of Marxism-Leninism. To delve in and out of words without doing so is a "pity to waste energy without making up for it."

    I feel that if we compare the theories and methods of Marxism-Leninism for transforming people and transforming society with the set of "cultivation" and "governing the country and pacifying the world" in old Chinese philosophy, this comparison is like the comparison between modern scientific medicine and medieval medicine. Marxism-Leninism's transformation of people and transformation of society are based on the laws of social development everywhere. Just as modern medicine is based on physiology and pathology everywhere. Some old Chinese philosophers in the past specialized in "rectifying the heart and making the will sincere," while others also talked about "rites, music, military affairs, and agriculture," but they knew nothing about how society develops. It's like a doctor who relies solely on a good heart and a little knowledge of the properties of licorice and Bupleurum to treat diseases. This looks a bit ridiculous. But the "inner sage and outer king" way of the Chinese philosophers in the past is similar to this.

    In terms of criticism and self-criticism, the current criticism and self-criticism must be united with the masses. This is very different from the meaning of "self-restraint and introspection" that the moralists of the past specialized in in quiet rooms. Moreover, it is truly "what ten eyes see, what ten hands point to," which is much stricter than the "what ten eyes see, what ten hands point to, how strict it is" that the moralists of the past imagined in quiet rooms. In the past, it was a remarkable thing to have a few friends who mutually exhorted each other to do good. Now the Communist Party has several million people who are practicing criticism and self-criticism. Moreover, these several million people will also lead hundreds of millions of people in China to use this weapon to seek transformation. This is truly a major event unprecedented in history.

    I feel that the moral standards in society have been raised. Some moral standards that used to look very high have now become the basic conditions for "being a person." Some things that used to look like they were not bad and were worth promoting can now be despised. Personally speaking, looking back at the things I have done in the past, not to mention the errors, even the things that were not errors were mostly out of individualism or individual heroism, and can be criticized under the moral standards of the new society.

    In short, I feel that in the new society led by the Communist Party, everything is developing upward. I myself feel that I am also in upward development. In this year, although I cannot know exactly how much I have progressed, I have already begun to know my previous lack of progress, which can certainly be considered a progress.

    一年学习的总结
    冯友兰
    北京解放已经一年了。在这一年中间，中国有了旋乾转坤的变化。社会每天都在改造进步之中。每个人也都在改造进步之中。回头把我自己这一年的学习经验检讨一下，自觉也有一点进步，就是自己开始觉得以前的不进步。
    在一个月以前，有人从河南来谈到一个地方，还没有实行土改。有人还是什么事不作，而生活相当舒服。我心里很觉得不平。后来我想，这大概就是改变立场的开始。记得我于一九四四年的冬天，因为我母亲的丧事，从昆明回老家一趟。（我已经有二十多年没回老家了。）看见那些地主间亲戚朋友们的生活方式，与二十年前基本上没有改变。这些方式的意义，有许多可以推到秦汉以前。我从那个时候才真了解中国乡村的封建性。那些地主的生活标准，虽已因战事而低落，但还是不劳而获，坐享其成。可是在那时候，我并不觉得有什么不平。可见在那时候，我虽然已有二十多年靠教书薪资生活，但是因为出身的关系，情感上还是倾向于地主阶级。
    我在解放以前，并不知道有阶级情感之说。后来才知道，也相信，一个人必须对于某一阶级，有真情实感，他才可以站在那一个阶级的立场。我以前虽然在知识方面，自以为不是怎样的不开明，而且在有个时候，自以为是“左倾”，但是真情实感还是倾向于地主方面。这就决定我以前的立场。
    这种立场，就决定我的行动，在对日抗战时期，国民党拉拢我的时候，使我不能断然拒绝，而采取自以为是不即不离的态度，自以为是不谈政治，只为学术而学术，为教育而教育。在现在看起来，这都是自欺欺人的说法。其实“不离”就是“即”了。在抗战以后的革命时期，我极力想改正以前的错误路线，但是没有一种断然决然的处置。这当然也是上边说的立场所决定的。
    一个多月以前，在一个哲学会里，大家谈到，一个社会到了不得不变的时候，不愿意变的人，总想抓着一个思想上的什么东西，以为寄托。在美国，天主教的新多马学派，现很流行，就是这一种的表现。当时我忽然觉得以前我在中国思想战线中的地位。在抗战时期，我写的讲新理学的书，不也是相当流行吗？我那几本书，名称上都加一个“新”字。照现在看，所谓新者，只是在中国旧哲学的圈子中说的。我以前所讲的新理学，可以说是中国旧哲学的回光返照。正像西洋新多马学派是西洋的中世纪哲学的回光返照。虽是回光返照，但就其社会影响说，是可以作为不愿意变的人的一种寄托。因此其社会影响是与革命有阻碍的。
    我近来了解真理，作为一个思想系统看，是活的。它也可以随时随地而异其应用，而在其时其地都是真理。它也是发展的，它的活就是它的发展。当我真切了解这个道理的时候，忽然觉得有一种凌空无所依靠之感。这种感觉证明，我以前的思想习惯，使我总想有一种永恒不变的以为依靠。我虽然承认具体的事物是变的，但我之所以少谈具体的事物，正是不敢正视变。这当然又回到上边所说的立场问题。我之所以能写书为那些不愿意变的人的一种寄托，正因为我在知识上虽说是不怕变，而在情感上也是一个不愿意变的人。因此我之“著书立说”，不仅只妨碍了自己的进步，也妨碍了有些别人的进步。
    以上的情形，别人必早已看得很清楚，也有人作过这种评论。但以前我总以为我是超阶级的，我的思想也是超阶级的，对于这种评论，认为是不值一驳。在今年春天，有一位共产党里的同志向我说：“你是学哲学的，不容易觉得世界是变的。”那时候我心里觉得很不以为然。因为我自以为在我以前的写作中，讲变的地方也很不少。照现在看，这些批评都是对的。在北京解放以前，我本是早已准备不走，而等候变的。既然决定不走，可是也没有多看一点共产党的书籍文件，作为思想上的准备。照现在看，这是很奇怪的。这当然还是不愿意变的心理在那里作祟。
    我以前并不知道共产党有批评及自我批评的办法。初解放时，虽知有此办法，还不了解为什么这个办法会是一个革命的武器。后来参加过几次共产党员入党及由候补党员转为正式党员的会，看见一个党员于入党之前，必先在群众面前，反复的受人批评与自我批评。如是他才可以不把他的“旧染之污”带进党里去。近几个月来，我也试行作一点自我批评，才觉得这种工夫，作下去是无穷尽的。从前人说，校书如扫落叶，扫了一层又一层。人的过错也真像书上的错字一样，什么时候看，总有些在那里。可是扫过一回落叶也就有一回开朗。大有“山穷水尽疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”的样子。
    暑假前，有两个清华哲学系的同学，参加南下工作团。他们有一天听说我要自我批评。他们非常高兴，一夜没有睡觉，讨论怎样向我提意见。第二天他们来了，一谈，才知道我是要写文章“论”自我批评，并不要“作”自我批评。他们的意见也没有提出，原封带回去了。这是其中一位同学最近写信告诉我的。可见我以前必定有一种“拒人于千里之外”的不自觉的态度。虽然自以为很谦虚，实则是很骄傲。照现在看，一个人不“作”自我批评，而专“论”自我批评，是很可笑的。没有用过自我批评的工夫，怎么能把自我批评论得好，更是问题。
    我对于哲学的看法，也有转变。以前我以为哲学是不与政治社会发生直接关系的。它离这种关系越远，它就越“纯粹”。它又必需有一个纯理论的系统。它的理论越“细密”，它就越“专门”。因为有这种看法，所以以前总觉得，马列主义，从哲学的观点看，理论不够“专门”，而且与政治社会关系太密切，不够“纯粹”。现在我觉得这是牛角尖里面的看法。社会的改变，使我钻出牛角尖了。现在我觉得，哲学的主要任务，是改造人及改造世界。因此它必须应用到政治社会上去。它也不需有成厚本的理论辩论，以证明它的理论。辩论太多，反可以使人把它当成一种语言文字或知识看，因此“流连忘返”，而忽略了实践。
    在今年春天，我曾经打算写几篇文章“发挥”马列主义。照现在看，这种打算也是错误的。凭着书本上的一点皮毛知识，怎么就能写文章？况且马列主义是“行动的指南”，应该把它应用在批判解决社会问题上，应用在自我批评上。在这些应用上，如有所得，就是真正发挥了马列主义。不如此而从文字上钻出钻入，都是“可怜无补费精神”。
    我觉得，如果将马列主义改造人与改造社会的理论及方法与中国旧哲学中的讲“修养”及“治国平天下”的一套，作一比较。这一比就好像现代科学医学与中古式的医学之比。马列主义改造人与改造社会，处处都是根据社会发展的规律。犹之现代医学处处都根据生理学病理学。中国从前旧哲学家，有些专讲“正心诚意”，有些兼讲“礼乐兵农”，可是对于社会是怎样发展的，毫无所知。好像一个医生，专凭一片好心，及对于甘草柴胡等药性的一丝丝知识，就要治病。这看着有点滑稽。可是中国以前哲学家所讲“内圣外王”之道是类乎此的。
    以批评及自我批评而论，现在的批评与自我批评，必与群众联合起来，与以前道学家专在静室中“克己省察”意义就大不相同。而且真是十目所视，十手所指，比以前道学家在静室中所想像的“十目所视，十手所指，其严乎”严得多了。以前只要有几个朋友，互相责善，就是很了不得的事。现在共产党有几百万人，都在实行批评与自我批评。并且这几百万人，还要率领全中国的几万万人，都用这个武器，以求改造。这真是历史上旷古未有的大事。
    我觉得社会中的道德标准提高了。从前有些看着像是很高的道德标准，现在都成了“为人”的起码条件。从前有些看着像是并不算坏而且值得提倡的事，现在是可以鄙弃的了。就我个人说，回看以前所作的事，其错误的不必说，就是不算错误的，也大多出于个人主义或个人英雄主义，在新社会的道德标准下，都是可以批评的。
    总之，我觉得在共产党领导的新社会中，一切都是向上发展的。我自己觉得我也是在向上发展中。在这一年之中，我虽不能确知我究竟进步了多少。但是已经开始知道以前的不进步，这当然也可以算是一个进步。
