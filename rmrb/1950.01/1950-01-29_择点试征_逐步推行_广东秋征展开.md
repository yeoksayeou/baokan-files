Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 27th. Following the achievements and experience gained from "selective trial collection," Guangdong Province's autumn grain collection work is now gradually entering the stage of full-scale collection. In mid-December of last year, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government promulgated the Regulations on the Collection of Public Grain and its Detailed Implementation Rules. Subsequently, various localities carried out preparatory work such as convening cadre meetings, establishing grain collection committees, and running grain collection training classes. By the end of December, selective trial collection was conducted in various counties. At the beginning of the trial collection work, many cadres believed that the collection quota was too heavy. They also believed that in the old revolutionary areas of Guangdong, grain was scattered due to the rent reduction and interest reduction movement, while in the new areas, there were few cadres and a weak mass base. Therefore, they lacked confidence in completing the task. However, the results of key trial collections in various counties proved that this idea was incorrect. For example, Kongdong Township in Yangchun County was scheduled to complete a task of 350,000 jin in seven days, but in fact, it collected more than 533,700 jin in four days, exceeding the original plan by more than 183,700 jin, and it was fair and reasonable, and not overly burdensome. Cangxia and Xucun townships in the urban area of Jiaoling County also completed their tasks as scheduled. Other counties such as Xingning, Meixian, Fengshun, Panyu, Sihui, and Kaiping also had many villages and townships that completed their tasks as scheduled. Farmers in the old revolutionary areas enthusiastically handed over grain. For example, dozens of villages in Liju, Tiechang, and Longzhi townships in Longchuan County launched a grain delivery competition, proposing competition conditions such as reasonable delivery, fast delivery, good delivery, good storage, and good transportation. Farmers in Shanta Village, fearing falling behind, lit torches and delivered grain at night. Upon receiving the notice of grain collection, farmers in Sanjiaopu, Zhouling District, handed over all the public grain in a few hours. The places where the trial collection work was relatively successful this time were all due to mobilizing the peasants to carry out struggles against local tyrants and the movement to investigate hidden land, while grasping the specific conditions of the locality and solving problems for the peasants. For example, Bawei Township in Boluo County is a new area. After the cadres resolved disputes for the peasants and helped them reduce rent, the peasants enthusiastically paid public grain. Datang Township in Qujiang County convened a meeting of peasant representatives during the trial collection. At the meeting, typical suffering was recounted to mobilize the masses, and then the grain collection methods were discussed, mobilizing the peasants to assess the land and investigate hidden land, thus quickly completing the autumn collection task.

    “择点试征”逐步推行
    广东秋征展开
    【新华社广州二十七日电】广东省秋季征粮工作在进行“择点试征”获得成绩与经验后，现正逐渐进入全面征收阶段。去年十二月中旬，广东省人民政府颁布了征收公粮条例及其施行细则，接着各地即进行召开干部会议、成立征粮委员会、开办征粮训练班等准备工作，至十二月底，即在各县进行择点试征。试征工作开始时，有不少干部认为征额太重，又认为广东老区经过减租减息运动，粮食分散，新区则干部少，群众基础薄弱，因此完成任务的信心不足。但各县重点试征的结果，证明这种想法是不正确的。例如阳春县空峒乡预定七天完成三十五万斤的任务，结果四天即征得五十三万三千七百余斤，比原定计划超过了十八万三千七百余斤，而且公平合理，并未过重。蕉岭县城区仓下、徐村等乡亦如期完成了任务。其他如兴宁、梅县、丰顺、番禺、四会、开平等县也有不少村乡如期完成任务。老区农民都踊跃缴粮。如龙川县黎咀、铁场、龙雉等乡共几十个村发动缴粮竞赛，提出出得合理、交得快、交得好、保管好、运得好等竞赛条件。珊塔村农民恐怕落后，星夜点起火把送粮。舟岭区三角浦农民一接到征粮的通知，几小时内就把公粮全部交齐。此次择点试征工作成绩比较好的地方，都是由于发动了农民进行反恶霸斗争和查黑田运动，同时掌握当地的具体条件，替农民解决了问题。例如博罗县八围乡是新区，在干部替农民解决了纠纷、帮助农民减租后，农民就热烈交纳公粮。曲江县大塘乡在试征时召开了农民代表会议，会上进行典型诉苦，发动了群众，进而讨论征粮办法，动员农民评田、查黑田，因此迅速完成了秋征任务。
