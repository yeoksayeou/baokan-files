Chahar Province's Water Conservancy Task This Year
    Strive to Complete 1.6 Million Mu of Siltation and Irrigation Projects
    Prevent Floods and Ensure Production
    [Chahar News] In order to develop water conservancy, prevent floods, and increase agricultural production, the Chahar Provincial People's Government convened a five-day provincial water conservancy work conference on December 20th of last year. In addition to briefly reviewing and summarizing past water conservancy work, the conference, based on the specific conditions in Chahar, established specific guidelines and tasks for water conservancy work in 1950. The guidelines are: Leadership should implement responsibility at each level, dedicated leadership, and in-depth organization. Based on the different conditions in various regions (manpower, materials, technology), vigorously develop standardized water conservancy construction in a planned and step-by-step manner. Strive to benefit in the current year, either in part or in large measure. Widely develop and restore all small and medium-sized water conservancy projects to achieve realistic increases in production. Launch mass movements for flood prevention construction, increase flood control facilities for various rivers and gullies, reduce flood damage, and ensure production. In terms of tasks, the overall task is to strive to complete 1.6 million mu of water conservancy siltation and irrigation projects in 1950, requiring 700,000 mu to benefit from water conservancy in the current year, and to widely repair dikes, build dams, and dredge water to reduce flood damage and ensure production. The specific plan is: to complete three major state-owned water conservancy projects (the Sanggan River First Siltation Irrigation Area Project, the Yu River and Guangji Water Conservancy Project), with a total siltation area of ​​one million mu, striving to benefit 300,000 mu in the current year. Organize the masses to cooperate in building larger local water conservancy projects, with a total siltation area of ​​350,000 mu, striving to benefit 70,000 mu in the current year. Widely develop small-scale water conservancy projects of 250,000 mu, 125,000 mu in the Chanan Special District, 120,000 mu in Yanbei, 5,000 mu in Chabei, and 40,000 mu for silted beaches and land protection projects. Regarding the promotion of waterwheels, 1,500 in the Chanan Special District and 500 in Yanbei. In terms of well drilling, 1,000 in Chanan, 450 in Yanbei, and 50 in Chabei.
    The specific methods to achieve the plan are: first, to clarify the thinking of the cadres, so that everyone clearly recognizes that water conservancy construction is the most realistic and effective way to improve agricultural production. Second, to establish and improve water conservancy leading bodies and professional organizations. Train cadres to solve technical difficulties. Before the spring thaw in 1950, prepare for water conservancy construction and lay the foundation for construction. In terms of manpower and material preparation, mainly vigorously organize the masses' manpower, materials, and financial resources to invest in water conservancy construction. The insufficient part will be solved by public loans.

    察省今年水利任务
    争取完成百六十万亩淤灌工程
    防止水患保障生产
    【察哈尔讯】为了发展水利防止水灾增加农产，察哈尔省人民政府于去年十二月二十日召开了历时五天的全省水利工作会议。会上除简要地检查并总结了过去水利工作外，根据目前察哈尔具体条件，规定出一九五○年水利工作具体方针与任务。其方针是：在领导上要贯彻逐级负责，专人领导，深入组织。根据各地不同条件（人力，物力，技术），有计划有步骤地大力开发正规化的水利建设。争取当年受益一部或大部。广泛开发和恢复一切中小型的水利，达到现实增产。开展群众性的防洪建设运动，增加各河流峪沟防洪设施，减免水灾，保障生产。在任务方面，总的任务是争取一九五○年完成一百六十万亩的水利淤灌工程，要求当年发挥水利七十万亩，广泛修堤筑坝疏水，减免水害，保障生产。具体计划是：完成三大国营水利工程（桑干河第一淤灌区工程，御河及广济水利工程），全部淤灌区面积可达百万亩，争取当年受益三十万亩。组织群众合作兴修地方性较大的水利工程，全部淤灌面积三十五万亩，争取当年受益七万亩。广泛开展小型水利二十五万亩，察南专区十二万五千亩，雁北十二万亩，察北五千亩，淤滩护地工程四万亩。在推广水车上，察南专区一千五百架，雁北五百架。在凿井方面，察南一千眼，雁北四百五十眼，察北五十眼。
    实现计划的具体办法是：首先搞通干部思想，使大家认识清楚水利建设是改进提高农业生产最现实最有效的办法。其次，是建立健全水利领导机构及专业组织机构。训练干部，解决技术困难。在一九五○年春季解冻前，作好水利建设准备工作，打下施工基础。在人力和物质准备上，主要大力组织群众人力、物力、财力，投到水利建设中去。其不足部分，由公家贷款解决之。
