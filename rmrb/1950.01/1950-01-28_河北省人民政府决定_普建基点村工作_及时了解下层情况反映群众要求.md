    Hebei Provincial People's Government Decides to Universally Establish Base Point Village Work
    Promptly Understand Grassroots Situations and Reflect People's Demands
    [This Newspaper News] Hebei News: In order to further strengthen the connection between the government and the broad masses of the people, implement the spirit of inspection work, promptly understand the accurate situation at the grassroots level and the degree to which each task and policy is implemented, and promptly reflect the demands of the masses, the Hebei Provincial People's Government has decided to establish base point villages throughout the province. On January 23rd, the government issued the following instructions regarding the establishment methods, scope of work, and working methods:
    (1) Each county should generally establish one base point village per district (but not evenly distributed), selecting villages of different types that are representative, conveniently located for transportation, and easy to lead. However, the main criteria should be based on their economic foundation and production development, so that they can represent general villages. After each county determines the villages, it should report them to the province and the special commissioner's office for record.
    (2) Each base point village should have one cadre detached from production, called a base point village assistant. The cadre's qualifications should be equivalent to those of a district assistant, with considerable work experience, a certain level of education, able to read instructions and documents, and able to conduct surveys, statistics, and written reports. Their living and office expenses shall be the same as those of general assistants, and shall be paid from the county's local grain revenue.
    (3) The base point village assistant's regular work is to systematically reflect various basic situations under the instructions of higher authorities, deeply understand the degree to which various tasks and policies are implemented, reflect the suffering, voices, and demands of the masses, conduct surveys and statistics, and be responsible for promoting the tasks assigned by higher authorities in the base point village. The base point village assistant is a member of the district office organization and may participate in district affairs meetings and other necessary meetings. When implementing county and district instructions and decisions, they have a leading relationship with the village; in general daily work, they have a guiding relationship with the village. However, their scope of work is mainly in the base point village, and the county and district must not transfer them away from the base point village for other work.
    (4) Under the intention of the provincial leading organs, the base point village assistants carry out their work through the county and district organizations. In addition to reporting temporary, urgent, and major issues at any time, the provincial leading organs will periodically arrange the report center and survey statistics items for each stage and complete them on schedule. In order to unify the survey items and reduce overlap, in the future, when the province arranges base point village survey tasks, it shall uniformly consult with the Provincial Government Research Office and various competent departments to formulate them, and other levels and departments shall not arrange them independently. When arranging survey tasks, the province shall print and distribute survey forms, three copies for each base point village, which shall be forwarded by the county. After the forms are filled out, the assistants shall directly report one copy each to the province, the special zone, and the county. (The departments receiving the forms at each level will temporarily stipulate this when arranging survey tasks.)
    (5) In addition to reporting survey statistics and various special reports on the specified dates, the base point village assistants shall write a report every half month. The content mainly includes: (1) the progress of the current central task; (2) the main mass reflections and demands; (3) the major problems that have occurred. Two copies of the report should be written and directly reported to the county government and the Provincial Government Research Office, one copy each. After receiving the instructions, each county should establish them cautiously and step by step. It is required that they be universally established within three months, and the establishment situation should be reported to the province.

    河北省人民政府决定
    普建基点村工作
    及时了解下层情况反映群众要求
    【本报讯】河北消息：为进一步密切政府与广大人民的联系，贯彻检查工作的精神，及时了解下层的确切情况与每一工作每一政策贯彻实施的程度，及时反映群众的要求，河北省人民政府决定在全省范围内建立基点村；并对建立办法、工作范围与工作方法于一月二十三日指示如下：
    （一）各县大体上每区设一基点村（但不是平均分配），选择不同类型、具有代表性、交通联系比较便利及便于领导的村。但主要应根据其经济基础，生产发展的情况，以能代表一般村为标准。各县确定后报省及专署备案。
    （二）每基点村专设一脱离生产的干部，称为基点村助理员。干部条件要相当于区助理员，有相当工作经验，有一定文化水平，能看指示文件及能作调查统计与文字报告等工作。其生活及办公费供给皆与一般助理员同，由县地方粮内开支。
    （三）基点村助理员之经常工作，为在上级指示下，系统地反映各种基本情况，深入了解各项工作及政策贯彻执行的程度，反映群众疾苦、呼声与要求，进行调查统计，并负责上级布置的工作在基点村的推行。基点村助理员是区公所组织成员之一，得参加区务会议及其他必要会议。在执行县区指示决定时，对村是领导关系，在一般日常工作中对村是指导关系。但其工作范围主要是在基点村，县区不得将其调离基点村作其他工作。
    （四）基点村助理员在省领导机关意图下，通过县区组织进行工作，除对临时紧急重大问题须随时报告外，并由省领导机关定期布置每一阶段的报告中心及调查统计项目，按期完成。为了统一调查项目减少前后重叠，今后省级布置基点村调查任务时，一律经过省府研究室与各主管部门协商制定，其他各级各部门均不得自行布置。布置调查任务时，由省印发调查表，每基点村三份，由县转发，表填好后，由助理员直接报省、专区、县各一份。（各级收表部门在布置调查任务时，临时规定。）
    （五）除调查统计及各种专题报告应按指定日期报告外，基点村助理员每半月写一汇报。其内容主要是（１）当前中心工作进行的情况；（２）主要的群众反映与要求；（３）发生的较大问题。汇报要写两份，直接报县政府及省府研究室各一份。各县接指示后应慎重的有步骤的建立。要求于三个月内普遍建立起来，并将建立情形报省。
