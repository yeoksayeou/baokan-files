    Taiyuan Northwest Steel Company Holds Grand Meeting
    to Celebrate New Production Record
    Thanks to the technical guidance of Soviet experts and the concerted efforts of all employees, a glorious record of a quarter increase in steel production compared to the period under Japanese and Yan rule was achieved.
    [This News] On December 5th last year, the Northwest Steel Company specially convened a grand celebration meeting for the new production record, celebrating the iron-smelting department's creation of a daily output of 80 tons of pig iron, the steel-smelting department's production of one furnace of steel in 7.43 minutes, and the monthly output of 2,647.478 tons of steel ingots, setting new production records. Lü Hongan, Secretary-General of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Kang Yonghe, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and Guo Qinan, Deputy Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Taiyuan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, attended to offer their congratulations. The main reason for creating the new record was the help and guidance from our international friend, the Soviet experts, in technology, and the result of the concerted efforts of all employees. During this period, seven special-class models, including Wang Guiying and Gao Huangliang, and fifty-eight model employees emerged.
            Adopting Soviet Technician's Suggestions,
            Improving Furnace Baking and Repair Methods
    The Northwest Steel Plant, the backbone of Shanxi's industry, built more than a decade ago, had a maximum monthly output of 1,700 tons of iron and 2,187 tons of steel, with each furnace of steel taking nine to ten hours, due to the cruel oppression and exploitation of workers by the Japanese invaders and Yan's puppet regime, as well as backward smelting technology. After the liberation of Taiyuan, the consciousness of the working class was generally raised, living standards were initially improved, and they played an active and creative role in production. In November, after the Soviet technicians came to the plant, they participated in technical guidance with their thirty years of scientific experience, sincerely and concretely. Seeing that the steel-smelting department's baking furnace required twenty days to load materials for production each time, they helped to modify the baking furnace pattern, changing the original baking furnace method of first using firewood, then small gas, and then large gas, to directly using large gas after the baking furnace temperature increased to 800 degrees Celsius, shortening the baking furnace time to eight days, which was twelve days earlier than before. If calculated by producing 80 tons of steel per day, it increased steel production by 960 tons, and the value of labor and gas saved in the other twelve days cannot be calculated. In the past, the steel-smelting furnace used the wet repair method (i.e., using wet magnesite) to repair the furnace bottom after every four or five steel output. The Soviet friend suggested using the dry repair method (dry magnesite), and changing the method of filling and leveling the magnesite and then drying it to gradually adding and gradually drying it. This allowed the furnace bottom to be repaired once after twenty steel outputs, instead of every four or five times, reducing the number of furnace repairs by thirteen times per month. Removing the consumption of these thirteen repair costs and the waste of labor, simply using the time of thirteen repairs for production could increase steel production by 270 tons. "With the help of Soviet friends, it's like adding a steel plant," is a consistent compliment to the enthusiastic help of Soviet technicians.
            All Employees Enthusiastically Discuss
            Completing the Creation of New Records
    The help of Soviet friends brought boundless confidence to all employees. Based on this new production situation, the company leadership put forward the task of a monthly output of 2,000 tons for the iron-smelting department; requiring the steel-smelting department to produce 80 tons per day and one furnace of steel in eight hours. This arduous task was a revolutionary call for production to all employees. The Party, government, labor union, and youth league of the iron-smelting and steel-smelting departments moved in unison to carry out various mobilization tasks, mobilizing employees to deliberate and discuss. Based on everyone's opinions, they conducted a thorough inspection of the machinery and equipment, established a shift exchange system and labor discipline, established a merit evaluation committee, formulated a reward method for exceeding quotas, and found that the key to production lay in selecting and配配原料的合乎标准, and the correct leadership of technical employees. The employees confidently accepted the glorious production task. Time was tight and the task was heavy. Some workers frowned. Team leader Wang Guiying said, "With the help of Soviet comrades and everyone working hard, we will definitely be able to complete it!" On November 27, three bricks fell from the top of furnace No. 2, but the furnace did not stop and was still firing. Building worker Cao Sifu, risking the fire, rushed up and repaired the furnace with his skilled technique. Zhang Tongxi discovered that a screw on the backrest wheel of the 50-ton high truck was broken, but it was still running. He immediately rushed to repair it, avoiding a dangerous accident. Repairing the loading rod was scheduled to take eight hours, but he completed it in six hours. With the active efforts of all employees, the output of Iron Smelting Furnace No. 1 increased to 80.19 tons on November 16, creating a new record exceeding the task. The steel-smelting department launched a red flag competition. On November 25, furnace operator Zhang Ting placed the red flag on his furnace platform. Deputy Manager Guo asked, "Why did you seize the red flag before the steel was produced?" Zhang Ting said, "I wouldn't dare to seize it without confidence!" As a result, he took down the red flag with a new record of smelting one furnace of steel in seven hours and forty-three minutes.
    In November, a total of 2,883.628 tons of steel and 2,091.38 tons of iron were produced, creating a glorious record of increasing the highest output by a quarter compared to the period under Japanese and Yan rule, and shortening the steel output time by a quarter.
    The achievements were not easily obtained. The employees used the following verses to describe everyone's enthusiasm and the situation of intense production:
    "Soviets sweat, Chinese sweat,
    Furnaces of molten steel, rows of sweat;
    Second by second, minute by minute,
    The steel-smelting department's sun is hard to pass;
    Soviet hearts, Chinese hearts,
    Hearts respond to each other, smelting more steel and iron."

    太原西北钢铁公司隆重集会
    庆祝创造生产新纪录
    由于苏联专家的技术指导，全体职工的一致努力，创造了钢铁产量较日阎统治时期增加四分之一的光荣纪录。
    【本报讯】去年十二月五日，西北钢铁公司特召开了隆重的庆祝生产新纪录大会，庆祝该公司炼铁部创造日产生铁八十吨，炼钢部七点四十三分钟炼钢一炉，及月产钢锭二、六四七·四七八吨的生产新纪录。中共山西省委会吕鸿安秘书长，山西省总工会康永和主席，中共太原市委副书记、太原市总工会主席郭钦安等均亲临祝贺。创造新纪录的主要原因，是由于国际友人苏联专家在技术上对我们的帮助和指导，和全体职工一致努力的结果。在此期间，涌现了王贵英，高黄亮等七个特等模范，及五十八名模范职工。
            采用苏联技师建议，
            改进烤炉修炉办法
    开建十余年的山西工业脊梁——西北炼钢厂，过去由于日寇阎伪对工人们的残酷压榨剥削，以及冶炼技术的落后，每月最高炼铁一千七百吨，炼钢二千一百八十七吨，炼钢时间每炉九至十小时。太原解放后，工人阶级觉悟普遍提高，生活初步改善，在生产上发挥了积极性和创造性。十一月，苏联技师来到该厂后，他们以三十年来的科学经验，挚诚而具体地参与了技术指导。他们看到炼钢部烤炉每次需要二十天才能装料生产，便帮助改制了烤炉图案，由原来先用木柴、再用小煤气、后用大煤气的烤炉方法，改用烤炉热度增到八百度后即直接用大煤气的方法，使烤炉时间缩短为八天，较前提前十二天。每天如以产钢八十吨计算，则使炼钢生产增加九百六十吨，其他在十二天中，劳力、煤气所节省的价值更是不可以数计。过去炼钢炉每出四或五次钢即采用湿修炉底方法修理一次（即用湿镁砂），苏联友人建议用干修法（干镁砂），并由添平镁砂最后烧干的方法改为逐渐添、逐渐烧干的方法，这样使炉底出钢四、五次修理一次，进步到出钢二十次修理一次，全月可减少修炉十三次，除去这十三次的修理费的消耗和劳力的浪费，仅以修理十三次的时间用于生产，便可增产钢二百七十吨。“有了苏联朋友的帮助，像添了一个炼钢厂”，这句话是人们对苏联技师热忱帮助的一致赞语。
            全体职工热烈讨论
            完成创造新纪录
    苏联朋友的帮助，给全体职工带来了无量的信心。公司领导上根据这新的生产情况，向炼铁部提出了月产两千吨的任务；要求炼钢部日产八十吨，八小时出钢一炉。这一艰巨任务对全体职工来说是一个生产上的革命召唤。炼铁、炼钢部党、政、工、团齐一步调，进行各种动员工作，发动职工酝酿讨论，根据大家的意见，对机器设备进行了周密检查，建立了交换班制、劳动纪律，成立了评功委员会，制定出超额奖励办法，并找出了生产关键在于选配原料的合乎标准，及对技术员工的正确领导。职工们信心百倍地接受了光荣的生产任务。时间紧，任务重，有的工友皱眉头，带班王贵英说：“有苏联同志帮助，加上大家卖力干，一定能完成！”十一月二十七日，二号炉顶落下三块砖，炉子没有停还冒火，筑造工曹思福，冒着火烧抢上去，凭他熟练的技术，把炉子修好了。张桐喜发现五十吨高车靠背轮有一个螺丝断了，但仍在开动，他马上抢修，避免了危险发生。修理装料杆，预定八小时修好，他六小时完成了。在全体员工积极努力下，炼铁一号炉在十一月十六日产量提高到八○点一九吨，创造了超过任务的新纪录。炼钢部展开了争红旗竞赛，十一月二十五日，司炉张廷?把红旗插在自己炉台上，郭副经理问道：“还没出钢为啥就夺了红旗？”张廷?说：“没有把握，就不敢夺！”结果用七时四十三分炼钢一炉的新纪录，拿下了红旗。
    十一月全月共产钢二、八八三点六二八吨，产铁二、○九一点三八吨，创造了较日、阎统治时最高产量增加四分之一，出钢时间缩短四分之一的光荣纪录。
    成绩不是轻易获得的，职工们用以下的诗句，描写大家的热情与紧张生产的情景：
    “苏联人流汗，中国人流汗，一炉炉钢水一行行汗；一秒一秒走，一分一分算，炼钢部的太阳空过难；
    苏联人的心，中国人的心，
    心心相应多炼钢和铁。”
