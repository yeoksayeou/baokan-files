Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: The National Navigation and Highway Conference convened by the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government successfully concluded on December 27th of last year. The conference began on November 19th in Beijing, attended by 66 delegates from various regions. After hearing reports on navigation and highway work from the Northeast, East China, North China, Central China, and Northwest regions, the conference conducted detailed discussions in groups and decided on the work guidelines, tasks, and plans for 1950, and established a unified leadership and system for transportation organizations. Li Yunchang, Deputy Minister of Transportation, pointed out in his concluding report that the transportation work guidelines and tasks for 1950 were formulated based on the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the actual situation. They are to continue supporting the war, strive for the complete victory of the country, and restore production, primarily serving the revolutionary war. Because the war has not yet ended, the state cannot allocate more money for transportation construction. Therefore, except for new construction urgently needed for the war, the general approach is to focus on consolidating and restoring on the existing foundation, organizing the existing vehicles and ships to improve their transportation capacity, and preparing for vigorously developing transportation construction after the war. The development of the transportation industry must adhere to the principle of "giving consideration to both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." Under the leadership of state-owned transportation enterprises as the backbone, private transportation cooperation should be promoted, private investment encouraged, and, where possible and necessary, private transportation enterprises should be encouraged to develop towards state capitalism. At the same time, the management of private transportation enterprises should be strengthened to gradually eliminate various speculative merchants in disguised transportation industries. In terms of business, a low-profit, high-volume, low-freight-rate policy should be adopted, and the active organization of large-scale freight transport should be pursued. Public transportation enterprises should rely on the working class and establish a democratic management system; private enterprises should sign collective contracts with trade union representatives.

    确定今年交通工作方针与任务
    全国航务公路会议闭幕
    决在现有基础上有重点地整理与恢复，准备战争结束后大力开展交通建设。
    【新华社北京六日电】中央人民政府交通部召开的全国航务公路会议已于去年十二月二十七日圆满闭幕。会议系于十一月十九日起在京召开，出席各地代表六十六人。会议于听取东北、华东、华北、华中及西北等地区航务公路工作情况报告后，经分组详尽讨论，决定了一九五○年的工作方针、任务与计划，及建立了交通组织的统一领导及制度。交通部李运昌副部长在总结报告中指出：一九五○年的交通工作方针与任务，是根据中国人民政协共同纲领的规定和实际情况而制定的，是继续支援战争，争取全国彻底胜利，恢复生产，而主要的还是为革命战争服务。因为战争尚未结束，国家不能拿出更多的钱来建设交通，所以除了战争所急需的新建设外，一般地是在现有基础上有重点地进行整理与恢复，将原有车船加以组织，提高其运输力，并为战争结束后大力开展交通建设作准备工作。发展交通运输事业必须遵照“公私兼顾、劳资两利”的原则，在国营运输企业为骨干的领导下，提倡民间运输合作，鼓励私人投资，并在可能与必要条件下鼓励私人运输业向国家资本主义方向发展，同时要加强对私营运输业的管理，逐步消灭各种化形运输业的投机商。在业务上，采取低利多运的低运价政策，而积极组织大量的货运。公营运输企业要依靠工人阶级，建立民主管理制度；私营企业应与工会代表订立集体合同。
