    America's First Conspiracy to Seize Taiwan
    Jiang Mengying

    Acheson's White Paper emphasizes the "traditional friendship" between China and the United States, and repeatedly states "respect for China's territorial integrity." But the facts are not so. I am presenting here ironclad evidence, a historical fact, namely America's first conspiracy to seize Taiwan.

    According to the U.S. Congressional Documents (Senate, Executive Documents) and the secret archives of the British Foreign Office, America's first conspiracy to seize Taiwan was hatched in the spring of 1857 (the seventh year of Xianfeng). The central figure of the conspiracy was the American Chargé d'Affaires to China, Parker. On December 12, 1856, he suggested to U.S. Secretary of State Marcy that if the representatives of Britain, France, and the United States arrived at the Baihe River and China still did not allow them to enter Beijing, then France could occupy Korea, Britain could occupy Zhoushan, and the United States could occupy Taiwan, until past problems were satisfactorily resolved and future problems were understood before withdrawing. On February 12, 1857, he reported to the Secretary of State: "The Taiwan issue now appears more important to our countrymen who are interested in management; even the powerful commercial countries of the West attach more importance to it than before. I sincerely hope that the U.S. government will not avoid action this time for reasons of humanity, civilization, navigation, commerce, etc."

    On the 24th, Chargé d'Affaires Parker wrote a letter from Macau to Commodore Armstrong, the commander of the American fleet stationed in Hong Kong, saying that he had irrefutable evidence that the valuable island (Taiwan), rich in minerals and agricultural products, was attracting the close attention of other countries. Therefore, he earnestly and urgently requested Armstrong to come to Macau as soon as possible to discuss the matter, and added emphatically: "I have reason to believe that if the United States is to take action, it must be done quickly, otherwise the opportunity will be missed."

    After receiving Parker's letter, Armstrong naturally rushed to Macau immediately. After their secret meeting, they fully agreed that Taiwan was an extremely important island, especially valuable to the United States. Unfortunately, with the existing naval power, it was impossible to take action. Parker sent the record of this meeting very secretly to the State Department in Washington.

    Why was the American Chargé d'Affaires Parker so active regarding Taiwan? In his "secret" report to the State Department on March 10, he said: Taiwan is rich in agricultural and mineral products and is the most valuable island. Last year's exports were worth more than 1.6 million yuan. If managed properly, it could soon double or quadruple. Coal is "inexhaustible," of good quality, and easy to mine; its importance in this age of steamship navigation is self-evident. From a commercial and political point of view, Taiwan's position is very important, especially for the United States. If a route is opened between California, Japan, and China, the coal resources here are best utilized. It is possible that Taiwan will not belong to China for long. If it is politically separated from China, as it is geographically, then it is obvious that the United States should occupy it in accordance with the principle of balance of power. Because in the Chinese sea, Britain already occupies Hong Kong, so if the United States seizes Taiwan, it certainly cannot object. If there is a country in the world that abandons itself and invites revenge, it is China.

    While Parker was planning how to seize Taiwan, he received news that Britain also had designs on Taiwan. On the 21st, he sent a protest to Bowring, the British Governor of Hong Kong and Plenipotentiary to China, solemnly stating: "I have received a completely credible report that senior British officials are closely watching Taiwan, in violation of your guarantee that Britain will not acquire any exclusive interests or privileges in China. I now, on behalf of the United States government, clearly and seriously protest against a policy of Britain occupying or controlling Taiwan, or any part of it. Should Taiwan become politically separated from China, the United States should have priority, for obvious reasons: First, American citizens have already entered into treaties with the Taiwan authorities; second, American citizens have been granted permission by the Chinese to actually settle in Taiwan, where the American flag has been flying for more than a year; as for other political reasons equally applicable to our two countries, there is no need to discuss them now." Coincidentally, at this time Bowring wanted to win over France and the United States to act in unison in order to solve the Guangzhou problem. After Schmerling agreed, Bowring went to Macau on April 1 and paid unofficial visits to Parker and the French Minister Bourboulon that day. The next day, the three held a meeting of the three-nation representatives at the French Legation. At this meeting, Parker suggested that in order to obtain a suitable treaty from China and ensure its implementation, the United States should occupy Taiwan, Britain should occupy Zhoushan, and France should occupy Korea. However, the British and French representatives were surprised by such an allocation, because, as Bowring said in his secret report to British Foreign Secretary Clarendon, "Taiwan is the most beautiful and fertile island in the Chinese sea, with a large and rapidly growing volume of trade; Zhoushan has no commercial value; and we know very little about distant Korea." With such a disparity in wealth, how could Britain and France be willing to let the United States monopolize the best piece? Therefore, Bowring politely resisted. "I explained my opinion extensively that the best way is to place any territorial division under the joint occupation of the three countries," Bowring continued in his secret report to the Foreign Secretary, "I can assure you that in this negotiation, I will do my best to prevent Britain from being placed in a vacant or secondary position." Thus, the first conspiracy of American imperialism to seize Taiwan was declared a failure.

    The above narrative of America's conspiracy to seize Taiwan is a true and ironclad historical fact. The United States has had territorial ambitions towards China from the beginning. More than ninety years ago, it had already conspired to seize Taiwan.

    This historical fact of the conspiracy is something Acheson's "White Paper" does not dare to mention. After reading this historical fact, we have a clearer understanding of the true face of American imperialism.

    美国夺取台湾的第一次阴谋
    蒋孟引
    艾奇逊的白皮书，强调中美“传统友谊”，口口声声“尊重中国领土完整”。事实并不是如此。我这里提出一个铁证，一件历史事实，就是美国夺取台湾的第一次阴谋。
    依据美国的《国会文书》（Ｓｅｎａｔｅ，Ｅｘｅｃｕｔｉｖｅ  Ｄｏｃｕｍｅｎｔｓ）和英国外交部的秘密档案，美国夺取台湾的第一次阴谋，是在一八五七年（咸丰七年）春季搞的。阴谋的中心人物，是美国驻华代办巴克。他于一八五六年十二月十二日，就向美国国务卿马西建议说，如果英法美三国代表到了白河，中国还不让他们进入北京，则法国可占领朝鲜，英国再占舟山，美国占领台湾，直到过去的问题圆满解决，将来的问题获得谅解，才可撤退。一八五七年二月十二日，他又向国务卿报告说：“台湾问题，对于我国富有经略兴趣的同胞，现在显得更重要了；便是西方诸强大的商业国家，对它也比以前重视。我很希望美国政府，为了人道、文明、海运、商业等等原因，这次不再避免行动。”
    巴克代办于二十四日由澳门写信给驻在香港的美国舰队司令亚门司龙，说他有毫无可疑的证据，那个矿产丰富农产丰富的很有价值的岛（台湾），正吸引着别国的密切注意。因此他恳挚地迫切地要求亚门司龙，赶快来澳门商量这事，并加重地说：“我有理由相信，如果美国要有所行动，必须赶快，否则机会就错过了。”
    亚门司龙接得巴克的信，当然马上赶到澳门。他们秘密会谈之下，完全同意：台湾是一个极重要的岛，特别对于美国富有价值。可惜的是，以现有的海军力量，不可能采取行动。巴克把这个会谈记录，很秘密地寄往华盛顿的国务院。
    为什么美国代办巴克对于台湾这么积极呢？他在其三月十日向国务院的“秘密”的报告中，说道：台湾富于农产矿产，是一个最有价值的岛。上年输出值一百六十余万元。如经营得法，不久可增一倍至四倍。煤是“取之不竭”的，品质既好，采掘又很容易；在这个汽船航行的时代，它的重要岂待多说。以商业的和政治的眼光看，台湾的地位都很重要，特别是对于美国。如在加利弗尼亚、日本和中国之间开辟航线，这里的煤源最好利用。台湾不会长久属于中国，这是可能的。若果它在政治上与中国分离，如地理上一样，则依照均势的原则，美国应占据它，也是很显然的。因为在中国海上，英国已占有香港，如美国夺取台湾，它当然不能反对。世上倘有一个国家自暴自弃，引人报复，那就是中国。
    巴克正在计划如何夺取台湾的时候，得到了英国对台湾也有图谋的消息，他就于二十一日向英国的香港总督兼驻华全权代表包令提出抗议书，郑重地说：“我获得完全可信的报告，知道英国高级官员正密切注视台湾，违反了阁下的保证，即英国不在中国获取任何独占的利益或特权。我现在代表美国政府，明白地严重地抗议一种政策，就是由英国占据或控制台湾，或它的任何一部分。万一要使台湾在政治上脱离中国，美国也该有优先权，理由很明显：第一，美国公民已与台湾当局订有条约；第二，美国公民曾得到中国人的允许，实际定居于台湾，那里飘扬着美国国旗，已经一年多了；至于我们两国同样可用的和其他政治性的理由，现在还不必谈。”恰巧这时包令为了解决广州问题，很想拉拢法国美国一致行动。经过薛穆同意后，包令就于四月一日前往澳门，当天即非式访问巴克和法国公使鲍彭隆。次日，三人在法国公使馆举行三国代表会议。巴克在这次会议中，建议为了向中国取得适当的条约，并保障它的实施，美国应占据台湾，英国占据舟山，法国占据朝鲜。然而对于这样的分配，英法代表都觉得惊奇，因为，正如包令向英国外相葛南登伯爵的秘密报告里说的，“台湾是中国海上最美丽最肥沃的岛，现有贸易额很大，并在激增中；舟山则毫无商业价值；而关于遥远的朝鲜，我们知道的还很少很少。”这样肥瘠悬殊的三个地方，英法岂甘让美国独吞一块最好的，所以包令就婉言抵制。“我广泛地说明我的意见，最好的办法是，任何领土的分割，应置于三国联合占领之下，”包令向外相的秘密报告中继续说，“我可以向您保证，在这番交涉中，我将尽力谨防英国不被置于空虚的或次等的地位上。”这样，美帝国主义第一次夺取台湾的阴谋，就宣告失败。
    以上叙述的美国阴谋夺取台湾的，千真万确的铁一样的历史事实。美国对华，一开头就有领土野心。在九十多年以前，就已阴谋夺取台湾了。
    这一阴谋的史实，艾奇逊的“白皮书”是不敢提及的。我们看了这一段史实，更认识清楚美国帝国主义的真面目了。
