Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th -- The All-China Federation of Scientific Societies has issued a statement expressing its serious protest against the Hong Kong authorities' action of declaring the Federation's Hong Kong and Kowloon branch an illegal organization and refusing its registration. The Hong Kong and Kowloon branch of the Federation, since its establishment in early 1949, has launched various academic activities in the Hong Kong and Kowloon area and has achieved good results. Not long ago, the branch held a celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China Central People's Government and launched activities to comfort the troops, which were warmly welcomed by Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Unexpectedly, after considering the application for registration for five months, the Hong Kong authorities suddenly announced on November 7 last year that the Hong Kong and Kowloon branch of the Federation was an illegal organization and refused its registration. This act of discriminating against and oppressing Chinese scientific workers will surely be resisted by righteous people around the world who love science and freedom.

    中国科协总会发表声明
    抗议香港当局迫害该会分会
    【新华社北京二十八日电】中国科学工作者协会总会，对香港当局宣布该会港九分会为非法团体不予登记的行动，特发表申明，提出严重抗议。该会港九分会于一九四九年年初成立后，即在港九地区展开了各种学术活动，都获得很好的成绩。不久以前，该分会为庆祝中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立，举行了庆祝开国大会和展开了劳军活动，都受到港九地区中国同胞的热烈欢迎。不料香港当局于申请登记考虑五个月之后，突于去年十一月七日宣布该会港九分会为非法团体，不予登记。这种歧视和压迫中国科学工作者的行为，必遭受到世界上爱科学爱自由的正义人士的反抗。
