Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 20th: TASS Moscow reports: The latest issue of the New Era magazine published a special article entitled "Lenin's Thought is Victorious" to commemorate the 26th anniversary of the death of the great revolutionary teacher Lenin, stating:

	Twenty-six years have passed since Lenin's death. However, his great image still lives in the hearts of millions of people, and his immortal thoughts, developed by the genius of Stalin's works and cause, are grasping the masses with ever-increasing power and have become the driving force of our time.

	The Soviet socialist state (a living embodiment of the Marxist-Leninist theory of socialist society), created by Lenin and Stalin, has existed for thirty-two years, and its strength and power are growing year by year.

	The Soviet Union is a beacon for all progressive humanity and a living example for all nations. The people's democratic countries of the East and the West, which have firmly embarked on the path of socialist development, are advancing shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union.

	The working people of Western Europe, led by Marxist-Leninist communist parties, are fighting for their interests and for national independence and the freedom of their countries.

	The revolutionary development in the deepest rear of the capitalist system – the colonial world – is a profound and correct testament to Lenin's and Stalin's analysis. The powerful ideas of Lenin and Stalin, the ideas of eliminating colonial enslavement, have inspired the powerful national liberation movements in the colonial world.

	The victorious advance of Leninism throughout the world has made the reactionary camp panic-stricken. They are trying to stop the spread of Leninist ideas at any cost, resorting to the most brutal atrocities and terrorism.

	But this is a waste effort! For the ideas of Lenin and Stalin, there are no boundaries, no insurmountable obstacles, because the thought of Leninism is the air of our time. The working people need these ideas as they need the air they breathe. Because only by fighting imperialism can they defend peace and democracy, defend freedom and independence, and gain the right to live a free new life, a life without capitalists and landlords.

	The Soviet Union's foreign policy, based on the principles drafted by Lenin and Stalin, inspires and unites the entire anti-imperialist democratic camp. "...Our peace policy is endorsed by the vast majority of the world's people" – these words of the great Lenin still resonate in our ears today, as if they were spoken only yesterday.

	On the 26th anniversary of Lenin's death, Leninist ideas continue to advance victoriously. The world's working masses, rising up to fight for liberation, are drawing inspiration and guidance from the clear and pure source of Marxist-Leninist science.

    列宁的思想正在胜利
    《新时代》纪念列宁逝世二十六周年专文
    【新华社北京二十日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：最近一期新时代杂志刊登一篇题为《列宁的思想正在胜利》的专文，纪念伟大的革命导师列宁逝世二十六周年称：
    自从列宁逝世至今已经二十六年了。然而，他的伟大的形象还活在千百万人民的心里，为斯大林的著作与事业的天才力量所发展了的他的不朽思想，正以愈来愈强大的力量紧紧掌握着群众，而且已经成为我们时代的推动力。
    列宁与斯大林所缔造的苏维埃社会主义国家（马列主义关于社会主义社会的理论之活生生的体现）已经存在三十二年了，这个国家的力量与实力，正在一年比一年地增长着。
    苏联是全体进步人类的灯塔，是各国人民活生生的榜样，东方与西方的业已坚决踏上社会主义发展道路的人民民主国家，正在和苏联并肩前进。
    由马列主义的共产党所领导的西欧劳动人民，正在为争取他们的利益、和争取民族独立与他们国家的自由而斗争。
    在资本主义制度最深远的后方——殖民地世界——革命的发展，便是列宁、斯大林主义分析的深刻与正确的明证。列宁与斯大林的强有力的思想，消灭殖民地奴役制度的思想，鼓舞了殖民地世界的强大的民族解放运动。
    列宁主义在全世界的胜利进军，使得反动阵营惶惶不可终日。他们正力图阻止列宁主义思想的传播而不惜任何代价，不惜采取最凶残的暴行与恐怖主义。
    这不过是白费气力！对于列宁和斯大林的思想来说，是没有界限、没有不可逾越的障碍的，因为列宁主义的思想，就是我们这个时代的空气。劳动人民需要这些思想，正如需要他们所呼吸的空气一样。因为只有和帝国主义斗争，他们才能维护和平与民主，维护自由与独立，才能获得权利去过自由的新生活、没有资本家与地主的生活。
    以列宁和斯大林所草拟的原则为基础的苏联外交政策，鼓舞着并团结着整个反帝国主义的民主阵营。“……我们的和平政策得到世界上绝大多数人民的赞同”——伟大的列宁的这些话语，今天仍然遗音在耳，仿佛是昨天才说出来似的。
    在列宁逝世二十六周年的这个日子，列宁主义的思想正继续向前胜利进军。起来争取解放的全世界劳动群众，正从马列主义科学这股澄彻晶莹的源泉中吸取鼓舞与指导。
