(Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th) The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued a decision on the study of cadres in service in 1950, stipulating the following learning content and methods: (1) Business studies (including specialized theoretical and technical studies and summaries of specialized business experience, etc.) shall still be organized by the leading cadres of each enterprise unit and each work department, while the Party propaganda and education departments shall regularly understand the business study situation of the cadres at all levels under their jurisdiction, and study and summarize experience. (2) The transmission and discussion of current affairs policies in various periods within the Party should become the main content of the Party's political life and branch work, and should be organized by the general branch committee and the branch according to the instructions of their direct superior Party committee, and should be closely linked with the struggle against undesirable tendencies within the Party. (3) All in-service cadres whose cultural level is not yet sufficient to graduate from junior high school should focus on cultural learning. In areas where cadres of organizations are relatively concentrated, cultural refresher schools should be organized administratively as much as possible, and strict entrance, promotion, and graduation examinations should be implemented. The Party's general branch and branch should be responsible for supervising and inspecting the study of Party members. (4) Organize theoretical study for cadres in service to improve their level of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. From January to the end of August 1950, all cadres in service who do not need to make up for cultural studies and have a certain ability to understand should participate in the study of Marxist-Leninist economics. In the process of learning, attention should be paid to the connection between economic theory and the actual current economic construction, and both tendencies of not attaching importance to book theory and being divorced from the current reality should be opposed. This study must be carried out with regular tests, and the test results should be announced. The Party branch should be responsible for urging Party members to actively participate in the study. The propaganda departments of the provincial and municipal Party committees should be responsible for studying and guiding the theoretical study of their subordinate cadres, and promptly reflect the situation, summarize experience, report to the Party committee and report upward by level. The decision also stipulates that rural district and village Party member cadres should mainly study culture in addition to current affairs policies and basic knowledge education of the Party. The methods can be carried out by organizing training courses and cultural supplementary classes, and through winter schools, night schools, and the individual help of intellectuals and cadres in districts and villages.

    【新华社沈阳七日电】中共中央东北局宣传部发出一九五零年在职干部学习的决定，规定各项学习内容及办法：（一）业务学习（包括专门理论的技术的学习及专门业务经验的总结等）仍由各企业单位、各工作部门的主管干部负责组织进行，党宣教部门则经常了解其所属各级干部业务学习情况，并研究总结经验。（二）各个时期的时事政策在党内的传达和讨论，应成为党内政治生活与支部工作的主要内容，统由总支委、支部根据其直属上级党委的指示负责组织进行，并使之与党内反对不良倾向的斗争经常密切地联系起来。（三）凡文化程度尚不够初中毕业水平的在职干部均应以学习文化为主。在机关干部比较集中的地区统由行政上尽可能的举办文化补习学校，实行严格的入学、升学和毕业考试。党的总支部和支部应负责督促、检查党员之学习。（四）组织在职干部理论学习，提高其马列主义和毛泽东思想的水平。一九五零年一月至八月底，凡不需补习文化、具有一定理解能力的在职干部均应参加学习马列主义经济学。在学习过程中，应注意经济学理论与当前经济建设实际的联系，反对不重视书本理论和脱离目前实际的两种偏向。该项学习须进行定期测验，公布测验结果。党的支部应负责督促党员积极参加学习，省、市党委宣传部门应负责研究和指导其所属干部的理论学习，并及时反映情况，总结经验，向党委汇报并按级向上报告。决定中并规定农村区村党员干部目前除时事政策与党的基本知识教育外，主要应学习文化。其方式可采用组织轮训班和文化补习班，及通过冬学、夜校及区村知识分子干部的个别帮助去进行。
