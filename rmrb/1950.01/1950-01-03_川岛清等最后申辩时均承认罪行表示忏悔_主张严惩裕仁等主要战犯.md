Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: TASS, Khabarovsk, reported: On the morning of December 30th, the Military Tribunal of the Primorsky Military District heard statements from defense lawyers.

    Lawyer Belov, defending defendant Yamada Otozō, said that the defendant held a position overseeing the production of bacteriological weapons, and the tactical use of these bacteriological weapons was tested on living human beings. His crimes are unprecedented and the most serious crimes against humanity. However, the lawyer said, I ask the court to consider that defendant Yamada has shown sufficient perseverance and courage in fully admitting his guilt. Lawyer Prokopenko, defending defendants Saneyoshi Katsuo, Kikuchi Jōzō, and Kurushima Shigeharu, requested the court to be lenient, as these defendants were originally lower-level workers who were only assistants in the criminal activities. The lawyers defending defendants Kawashima Kiyoshi, Kajitsuka Ryūji, Takahashi Takaatsu, Sato Haruji, Nishi Toyohiko, Hirazakura Zensaku, Karasawa Tomio, and Onoe Masao defined their crimes as causing terrible and painful disasters to the people of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic, China, and other countries, but requested the court to consider their confession and repentance when passing judgment.

    The court then heard the final statements of the defendants. The first to speak was Kawashima Kiyoshi. He said, before coming to the Soviet Union, I held absolutely wrong ideas about it. After being captured by the Soviet army, I realized how wrong my past ideas were. The first thing I clearly felt was the humane treatment given to me by the Soviet people. I thought about this fact, and I finally became convinced that this was not accidental but the result of the Soviet system. I understand that the crimes I committed are not only a shame to myself but also a shame to my country. I am ready to accept the court's most serious judgment.

    Defendant Karasawa Tomio said in his final statement that as early as 1946, at the International Military Tribunal, I stated and sincerely repented all the crimes I committed in Unit 731. I ask the court to give a fair judgment.

    Next to speak was defendant Yamada Otozō. He said, I was born into a military family and have served in the army since I was young. In the army, I was educated in the spirit of obeying orders and fulfilling the duties of a soldier. After being appointed Commander of the Kwantung Army, I accurately and resolutely executed all orders and instructions from the Army Ministry and the Japanese Army General Staff Headquarters. I admit my responsibility for all the atrocities committed by these units in preparing for bacteriological warfare. I fully understand the seriousness of my crimes and the magnitude of my guilt. Therefore, I do not consider the severity of my punishment.

    Defendants Kajitsuka, Sato, Hirazakura, Saneyoshi, Takahashi, Kikuchi, Kurushima, and Onoe made their final statements in succession. They all admitted their crimes, some asking the court to give a fair judgment, and others asking the court to be lenient. Hirazakura Zensaku said: This trial gives severe punishment to those of us who participated in the preparation of bacteriological warfare, which will be a warning and a good lesson to those who attempt to prepare for such a war. I hope that not only we will be severely punished, but also the main criminals responsible for preparing bacteriological warfare, Emperor Hirohito, General Ishii, and General Wakamatsu, who are not on trial here, should also be severely punished. Kikuchi Jōzō said: From childhood, I was taught to be loyal to the Emperor. During my four years in the Soviet Union, thanks to the warm and humane treatment of Japanese prisoners of war by the Soviet authorities, I realized how much I had been deceived and how much my education was needed. My soul has undergone a fundamental change. I regret that the main instigators and organizers of bacteriological warfare are not on trial here. I hate them.

    After hearing the final statements of the defendants, the court adjourned to deliberate.

    川岛清等最后申辩时均承认罪行表示忏悔
    主张严惩裕仁等主要战犯
    【新华社北京二日电】塔斯社伯力讯：十二月三十日上午，滨海军区军事法庭听取辩护律师的发言。
    律师贝洛夫为被告山田乙三辩护说，被告身负监督细菌武器生产的职务，而这种细菌武器的战术用途，曾在活人身上实行试验，其所犯罪恶，乃是史无前例的最严重的反对人类罪。但律师说，我请求法庭考虑被告山田有足够的毅力与勇气完全承认他的罪过。律师普罗柯彭科为被告三友胜雄、菊池乘三、久留岛重治辩护，请求法庭从宽发落，因为这些被告原是下层工作者，他们在犯罪活动中只是助手。为被告川岛清、梶塚龙二、高桥高笃、佐藤春二、西丰彦、平樱善作、唐泽富雄及尾上正雄等辩护的律师们，把他们的罪行规定为给予苏联、蒙古人民共和国、中国及其他国家的人民可怖而惨痛的灾难的罪行，但请求法庭在判决时考虑到他们已经认罪悔过。
    法庭继而听取被告的最后申辩。首先发言的是川岛清。他说，在我未到苏联之前，我对它抱着绝对错误的观念。在被苏军俘虏之后，我才了解到我过去的观念是多么的错误。我清楚感到的第一件事情，就是苏联人民给予我的人道的待遇。我对这件事实曾加以思考，我终于深信这不是出于偶然而是苏维埃制度的结果。我了解我所犯的罪恶不仅对我自己是一种耻辱，而对我的国家亦是耻辱。我准备接受法庭的最严肃的判决。
    被告唐泽富雄在其最后申辩时说，远在一九四六年，在国际军事法庭上，我便说出并诚心忏悔我在七三一部队所犯的一切罪行，我请求法庭给予公正的判决。
    接着发言的是被告山田乙三。他说，我出身于军人家庭，自青年起便服役军中。在军队中，我受到了执行命令及士兵天职的精神的教养。在被任命为关东军司令官之后，我准确而坚决地执行了陆军省及日军参谋总部的一切命令和指示。我承认我对这些部队准备细菌战所犯一切暴行所负的责任。我充分了解我的罪过的严重性及我的罪恶的规模之大，因此，我并不考虑对我惩罚的轻重问题。
    被告梶塚、佐藤、平樱、三友、高桥、菊池、久留岛、尾上，相继作最后申辩。他们都承认他们的罪行，有的要求法庭给以公正的判决，有的要求法庭从宽发落。平樱善作说：这次审讯给我们参加准备细菌战者以严厉的惩罚，这对于企图准备这种战争的那些人，将是一个警告和良好的教训。我希望不仅我们受到严厉的惩罚，而且负责准备细菌战的主要罪犯，现在未在这里受审的日皇裕仁、石井将军和若松将军，也应受严厉的惩罚。菊池乘三说：我从孩童时代起便被教以要忠于天皇。在留住苏联四年间，幸赖苏联当局对日本战俘温暖而人道的待遇，我了解我受到多么大的欺骗，我所受的教养是多么需要。我的心灵起了根本的变化。我可惜细菌战的主要策动者和组织者，未在这里受审。我恨他们。
    法庭在听完被告的最后申辩后，退庭进行讨论。
