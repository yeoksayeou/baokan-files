    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch: Since August of last year, various agencies and military units in the Northern Jiangsu District have implemented the East China District's plan for streamlining and economizing. The district has streamlined a total of 20,000 personnel detached from production, resulting in annual savings of over 40 million jin of grain. The quality of cadres has also improved as a result. The surplus personnel have been appropriately reassigned to replenish frontline troops or lower-level agencies in the rear. Significant achievements have also been made in production and economization. After initiating production, some agencies have become fully or partially self-sufficient in vegetable provisions. The Huaiyin and Yancheng military sub-districts produced over 640,000 jin of vegetables in three months, saving over 40,000 jin of rice, greatly improving the diet. Agencies in various localities have recovered over 17 million RMB, 2 million jin of grain and forage, and gold and silver, all of which have been handed over to the government as fiscal revenue. After the complete liberation of Northern Jiangsu, the arbitrary expansion of staffing by various agencies and the development of hedonistic and corrupt tendencies among a small number of cadres led to serious waste and corruption. In Tai County (northern part of eastern Taipei, a newly established county), waste and corruption resulted in the loss of over 105,000 jin of grain from April to August of last year; millions of jin of grain and forage rotted in various localities. In response to the call from higher authorities to overcome these shortcomings, the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office, Military District, and the Northern Jiangsu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party began reorganization in August, leading various agencies to conduct inspections and inventory assets, tighten the organization according to the new staffing plan, establish collective office systems, and strictly enforce disciplinary actions. Agencies and military units at all levels also universally implemented a "one or two jin of rice saving campaign" and strengthened production work. Because the spirit of the reorganization and economization plan was implemented from top to bottom, the above achievements were obtained.

    苏北各机关部队精简整编完成  年可节省开支四千万斤米
    【新华社上海电】苏北区各机关、部队自去年八月执行华东区整编节约方案以来，总计全区共精简两万脱离生产人员，每年可节省开支四千万斤以上的粮食；干部质量也因此提高。对编余的人员则分别补充前方部队或后方下层机关，作了适当安置。在生产节约方面也获得很多成绩。部分机关开展生产后，菜金已能全部或一部自给。淮阴、盐城两军分区三个月产菜六十四万余斤，节约大米四万余斤，伙食大为改善。各地机关共清理出人民币一千七百余万元，粮草两百万斤及金银等物，均已全部交公，作为财政收入。苏北自全面解放后，因各机关任意扩大编制，少数干部产生享乐腐化思想，曾发生严重的浪费及贪污现象。台北县（东台北部，新设县）去年四月至八月，因为浪费及贪污，共耗损十万五千多斤粮食；各地粮草霉烂数百万斤。为响应上级号召，克服此类缺点，苏北行署、军区、中共苏北区党委会于八月开始整编，领导各机关进行检查和清理资财，按新编制紧缩机构，建立集体办公等制度，严格执行纪律处分；各机关部队也普遍实行一两米节约运动和加强生产工作。由于上下都贯彻了整编节约方案的精神，故获得如上成绩。
