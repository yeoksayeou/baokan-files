    Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
    The Minjiang Shipping Trade Union of Fujian Province has been formally established. Over the past four months, although we have done our best in maintaining Minjiang transportation and supporting the front lines, our efforts are still not enough. Today, all our members assure you that we will unite more closely, work actively, and study diligently in the future. Under your wise leadership, we will strive for the liberation of Taiwan and the construction of a new Fujian and a new China. We offer our highest respect.

    Our Xianyou County People's Representatives Conference has successfully concluded. We, representing 300,000 people, enthusiastically discussed the future administrative guidelines for Xianyou's construction at this conference. We deeply understand that this conference is the result of the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you, and the heroic and self-sacrificing battles of the People's Liberation Army, which has led to this conference of genuine democracy and great unity of our people. We wholeheartedly thank you for your wise leadership and pay our highest respect to the heroic People's Liberation Army. We will always be under your leadership and are determined to unite the 300,000 people as one, and with our greatest efforts, overcome all difficulties, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and build a new democratic Xianyou. We will fully support the front lines and strive for the rapid liberation of Taiwan and the liberation of all of China.
