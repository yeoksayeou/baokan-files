Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th. All circles in Northeast China unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram to the United Nations requesting the expulsion of the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary clique, and unanimously praise the Soviet delegation's just action in firmly supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. Zhang Weizhen, Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, said in a written statement: "The Kuomintang reactionary government has long been disintegrating and has virtually ceased to exist. We resolutely demand that the member states of the United Nations Security Council accept the proposal of our Foreign Minister Zhou and expel the Kuomintang delegation from the United Nations." He also pointed out that the Soviet delegation's just proposal in the Security Council once again demonstrates that the Soviet Union is the true friend of the Chinese people. The Northeast Democratic Women's Federation also issued a statement saying: "The fact that the US and British imperialists have kept the Kuomintang bandit gang's representatives in the Security Council has aroused the anger of millions of mothers and wives in the Northeast. The member states of the Security Council should unconditionally accept Foreign Minister Zhou's proposal and immediately drive Jiang Tingfu out." The statement from the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League of Northeast China and the Northeast Student Federation said: "Only the representatives of the Central People's Government can represent the Chinese people. We cannot tolerate the United Nations continuing to keep political swindlers such as Jiang Tingfu in the Security Council." Chen Kangbai, Director of the Northeast Branch of the China Association of Scientific Workers, pointed out: "It is an ironic farce that the Security Council uses the representatives of the Kuomintang, who have been reduced to bandits and pirates, as chairmen to discuss international security issues."

    东北各界发表谈话和声明
    赞扬苏代表支持周外长声明
    要求安理会立即驱逐蒋廷黻
    【新华社沈阳十六日电】东北各界一致拥护周外长致电联合国要求驱逐国民党反动集团代表的声明，并一致赞扬苏联代表团坚决支持周外长声明的正义行动。东北总工会主席张维桢发表书面谈话称：“国民党反动政府早已土崩瓦解，实际上已经不再存在。我们坚决要求联合国安全理事会会员国接受我周外长建议，将国民党代表团从联合国中驱逐出去。”他并指出苏联代表团在安理会上的正义提案，再次显示苏联才是中国人民的真正朋友。东北民主妇女联合会亦发表声明说：“美英帝国主义者把国民党匪帮代表留在安理会中，已惹起东北千万个母亲和妻子的愤怒，安理会诸会员国应无条件接受周外长建议，立刻把蒋廷黻赶出去。”中国新民主主义青年团东北筹委会暨东北学生联合会的声明中说：“只有中央人民政府的代表，才能代表中国人民，联合国继续把蒋廷黻等政治骗子留在安理会中，是我们所不能容忍的。”中国自然科学工作者协会东北分会主任陈康白指出：“安理会用已沦为流寇和海盗的国民党的代表当主席来讨论国际安全问题，乃是一出讽刺丑剧。”
