    Development of Rural Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in North China
    Increased Elevenfold in Three Months
    With 1.4 Million Members
    [Our Dispatch] In the three months of August, September, and October last year, rural cooperatives in the North China region (excluding urban cooperatives) achieved great results in purchasing agricultural products, supporting sideline production, developing supply and marketing businesses, and establishing cooperatives.
    Currently, the entire region has five provincial-level general cooperatives, nine municipal-level general cooperatives, thirty-seven prefectural-level cooperatives (nine before July), two hundred and eighteen county-level cooperatives (one hundred and eighteen before July), six hundred and one district-level cooperatives (four hundred and sixty-nine before July), and five thousand eight hundred and twelve village-level cooperatives (including three thousand three hundred and eighty-seven old cooperatives; before July, there were only one hundred and ninety-three supply and marketing cooperatives, which increased to two thousand four hundred and twenty-five in three months, an increase of 11.6 times). The number of members increased from 665,912 to 1,431,833, more than doubling. This shows that the broad masses of peasants have truly recognized the benefits of cooperatives in their economic lives (selling grain and cotton, buying daily necessities), and therefore have actively established and joined cooperatives; it also proves that the "focusing on the development of rural supply and marketing cooperatives" policy of the North China Cooperative Conference is completely correct.
            Establishing New Cooperatives Should Be Closely Combined with Developing Supply and Marketing Businesses and Solving Members' Difficulties
    Combining cooperative organization with business, developing organization from solving members' difficulties through developing supply and marketing businesses, and keeping organizational work closely following business development is the main experience of success. In the Ding County Special District, fifty-three district-level cooperatives, thirty village-level cooperatives, and sixteen market town cooperatives were established, and one hundred and seventy-nine old cooperatives were transformed during the acquisition of agricultural products and the development of the weaving industry; 171,977 members were developed, with over two thousand members being added in Guo Village (a cloth-producing area) in Wuqi County alone. In the cotton purchasing business in October, Wei County developed 39,748 members, with over 90% of households in the county joining the cooperative; the purchase volume accounted for about 80%, and it was all done through methods of purchase on credit and exchange (all converted to real value). Therefore, the correct ratio of cotton and grain prices was grasped, and the interests of the members were guaranteed.
            Widely Using Contracts to Make Supply and Marketing Operations More Planned
    Supply and marketing cooperatives advocate the widespread use of contracts (short-term, small-amount) to link the supply and marketing businesses of cooperatives in production and sales areas, organize upper-level and lower-level cooperatives and cooperatives and members, and connect rural and urban agricultural and industrial products, shortening the commodity circulation process, reducing waste of funds and cadres, strengthening organization and planning, improving the business operation ability of cadres, and protecting the vital interests of producers and consumers. For example, in the Chahar province, 140,000 pieces of agricultural tools were produced through contracting; the Changzhi Special District signed contracts with native produce companies to promote the sale of 347,895 catties of hemp; and considerable results were achieved in the supply and marketing of native cloth and reed mats in the Pingyuan and Hebei provinces, making business operations more planned.
    Preliminary progress has been made in exploring methods for transforming old cooperatives. The Changzhi Special District transformed the business operations of old cooperatives, focusing on solving the production difficulties of members, and adopted methods of training old village and cooperative cadres. In the three months of August, September, and October alone, 190 old cooperatives were transformed, and 300 were able to better connect business with members, proving that starting the transformation from supply and marketing businesses is a successful method.
    However, in the development of new cooperatives and the transformation of old cooperatives, some areas still have some shortcomings and deviations that need to be overcome urgently. First, in the establishment of cooperatives, there are still deviations such as the separation of cooperative organization from business, and forced apportionment of shares. For example, some areas rely solely on the guarantees of party branches and mass organizations, putting forward slogans such as "all party members and village cadres must join the cooperative," and some propose five hundred members for large districts and three hundred and fifty members for small districts, which is obviously commandism; or when mobilizing people to join the cooperative, they do not talk about cooperative policies, and the masses join to obtain "purchase certificates," and then complain or withdraw from the cooperative when things are not cheap, or they collapse after the cadres of the upper-level cooperative leave. This proves that "haste makes waste," and that it is not feasible to not carry out business, not solve the buying and selling and production difficulties of members, not establish a democratic system, and not follow the mass line. Second, the transformation of old cooperatives has not yet received widespread attention. For example, in the six special districts of Hebei, there are 1,127 old cooperatives, but only 174 were transformed in three months. When transforming old cooperatives, most cannot grasp a positive and cautious attitude, are eager for quick success, or transform them haphazardly, without mobilizing the masses, and therefore cannot arouse the enthusiasm of the masses for transforming old cooperatives, or make them worse and worse. Third, some areas do not focus on key businesses. Although provinces have made arrangements for work in disaster areas, they have not yet conducted inspections and supervision. In the future, cooperative cadres should step up their business studies and familiarize themselves with policies.

    华北农村供销社发展
    三个月增加十一倍
    拥有社员一百四十万人
    【本报讯】华北区农村合作社（城市社除外），在去年八、九、十三个月中，收购农产品，扶植副业生产，发展供销业务，结合建社，已收到很大成绩。
    现全区已有省总社五个，市总社九个，专区社三十七个（七月前九个），县社二一八个（七月前一一八个），区分社六○一个（七月前四六九个），村社五八一二个（包括旧社三三八七个，七月前供销社仅一九三个，三个月中发展到二四二五个，增加了十一·六倍），社员由六六五、九一二人增加到一、四三一、八三三人，增加一倍还多。这说明广大农民在经济生活中（卖粮食、棉花，买日用品）真正认识了合作社的好处，因之纷纷建社入社；也证明华北合作会议以“发展农村供销社为主”的方针是完全正确的。
            建立新社应与发展供销业务解决社员困难密切结合
    组社与业务相结合，从发展供销业务解决社员困难中发展组织，使组织工作紧跟着业务发展，这是成功的主要经验。定县专区在收购农产与发展织布业中建立区社五十三个，村社三十个，集镇社十六个，改造旧社一七九个，发展社员一七一、九七七人，只无极郭庄（产布区）即增加社员两千多人。威县在十月份收棉业务中发展社员三九、七四八人，全县百分之九十以上的户都入了社，收购量占百分之八十左右，而且不通过市场，均以赊买换购（均折实）的方法，因此，正确掌握了棉粮价格比例，保障了社员利益。
            广泛运用订立合同使供销业务经营更有计划
    供销社提倡广泛运用订立合同的方法（短期小额），把产销两地的合作社供销业务联结起来，把上级社与下级社，合作社与社员组织起来，把农村与城市的农工产品衔接起来，缩短了商品流转过程，减少了资金与干部的浪费，加强了组织性计划性，提高了干部业务经营能力，保护了生产者消费者的切身利益。如察省通过订合同方法生产农具十四万件，长治专区与土产公司订合同推销大麻三四七、八九五斤，平原，河北供销土布苇席均收到相当效果，使业务经营更加有计划。
    对改造旧社已初步摸索到门径，长治专区转变旧社业务经营，着重为社员解决生产困难，并采用训练旧村社干部的方法。仅八、九、十三个月，即改造旧社一九○个，能较好的使业务联系社员者三○○个，证明从供销业务着手改造是成功的方法。
    但在发展新社与改造旧社中，有的地区还存在一些缺点和偏向，急待克服。第一、建社中还有发生建社和业务脱节、强迫命令摊派股金等偏向。如有的地区单纯依靠支部和群众团体的保证，提出“凡是党员，村干部都要入社”的口号，有的提出大区五百名，小区三百五十名，显然是命令主义；或者动员入社时不讲合作政策，群众为获得“购买证”而入股，遇到东西一不便宜时就发生怨言或退社，或者上级社的干部走后就垮了台，这证明“欲速则不达”，不活动业务，不解决社员买卖与生产上的困难，不树立民主制度，不走群众路线是不行的。第二、改造旧社还未引起普遍重视。如河北六个专区旧社一一二七个，三个月中仅改造一七四个。改造旧社时多不能掌握积极的审慎的态度，急于求成，或千篇一律的乱改造，不发动群众，因之不能引起群众对改造旧社的热情，或者越改越坏。第三、有的地区经营业务没有重点。各省对灾区工作虽有布置，但还没进行检查督促。今后合作干部应加紧学习业务，熟悉政策。
