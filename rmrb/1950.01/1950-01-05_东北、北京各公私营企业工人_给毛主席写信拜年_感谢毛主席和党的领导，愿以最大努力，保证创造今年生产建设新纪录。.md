[Report from our newspaper] Workers from various state-owned enterprises in Northeast China and workers from various state-owned and private enterprises in Beijing have written letters to Chairman Mao to extend New Year greetings on the occasion of the first victorious New Year since the founding of New China. They also reported on their production achievements and living conditions in 1949, and assured Chairman Mao that they would actively engage in production in 1950 to welcome the high tide of national economic construction. More than a thousand new record creators in Andong City jointly wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on December 28 last year to extend New Year greetings. The letter stated: As we welcome the first victorious year of our motherland's birth, we cannot personally pay you a New Year visit to express our ecstatic and excited feelings, but we would like to write a letter to let you know.

Chairman Mao, these few days cannot but remind us of the suffering we endured two years ago (referring to the period when the Chiang bandit army occupied Andong) and four years ago (referring to the period of Japanese rule). Whenever we compare the past situation with our current life and status, we feel full of strength and feel that we should improve production and have the responsibility to protect this victory.

	More than a Thousand New Record Creators in Andong Guarantee Greater Achievements This Year

Chairman Mao, you understand us best, and you will know how sincerely we love you. We won't say much more about these things now, we will only tell you one thing, which is also the thing you love to hear and care about most, and that is that Andong City, far from you, has launched a fervent movement to create new records. The new record for steaming ingredients created by the Andong Paper Mill is not only unprecedented in the factory, but also the highest standard in the country. More than sixty state-owned factories in the city generally completed their annual tasks ahead of schedule. Chairman Mao, you may be happy to see this news, but we still feel that our efforts are not enough and the achievements are not great enough. We would like to take this opportunity to express our determination to resolutely create more new records with greater efforts in 1950. And lead more worker brothers to make our New Year's gift to you.

Finally, they expressed their confidence that they would exceed their tasks even more in 1950, improve people's railways, and use practical actions to welcome the high tide of economic construction. The Shenyang Smelter, the First and Third Machine Factories, etc., all exceeded their annual production tasks in 1949. All employees sent a special telegram to Chairman Mao to report the good news. The smelter not only completed the additional copper and lead tasks for 1949, but also exceeded the crude copper task by 12.4%, crude lead by 18.8%, electrolytic copper by 4.1%, and electrolytic lead by 3.1%.

The letter reported the factory's production situation in 1949 and said: Chairman Mao, in order to lay the foundation for China's automobile manufacturing industry, we are determined not to remain at the existing small achievements and output.

The Renli Carpet Factory said in its letter to Chairman Mao: Dear Chairman Mao: Now let us tell you about our progress! In the past, our factory did not have Party and League organizations, but now we have established Party and League branches. In the past, we did not have our own trade union, but now we have our own trade union of the working class. Under the leadership of the trade union, we have our own workers' cooperative, where we can buy grain and daily necessities at lower prices than the market price. We have libraries, table tennis rooms, clubs, and night schools. These are all organized and managed by our workers themselves, serving our working class. In the past, we had no chance to attend political and cultural classes, but today we do. Because of you, you tell us the truth of the world sentence by sentence. We have made progress, we have turned over, all because of you and the leadership of our own Party. We assure you that in 1950, we will use a more active production spirit and all our strength to overcome the difficulties in this year's victory.
