    Representatives' Conferences Vigorously Promote;
    Hunan's Public Grain Begins Entering Storage
    Suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, investigating hidden land, assessing yields, and paying attention to checking policy implementation have promoted the smooth progress of the autumn grain collection.
    [Our Newspaper] Hunan Province's autumn grain collection work began in mid-October last year. As of late this month, the Changsha, Yiyang, and Shaoyang Special Districts have basically completed their tasks; the Changde, Hengyang, and Lingling Special Districts are currently delivering grain into storage. When the autumn grain collection work began, cadres from the old liberated areas did not fully understand the situation in the new areas and lacked experience in working in the new areas. They blindly believed that the burden was too heavy, which led to a lack of confidence in completing the task. The leadership addressed this situation by conducting key experiments. The key work group in the Changde Special District conducted democratic appraisal among the masses in the Third District, Sanbao of Changde County. The result exceeded the original assigned task by 10,000 jin and was fully in line with the policy. In Linxiang County, leading comrades personally took charge of the work in one district and three "bao," squeezing out a large amount of hidden land from landlords, which reduced the burden of the "bao" from 24.5 percent of the total output to 17.9 percent, alleviating the burden on farmers. The leadership promptly disseminated these experiences, greatly enhancing the cadres' work confidence and realizing that as long as they mobilized the masses to squeeze out landlords' hidden land and find out the actual output, it would not be difficult to complete the task.
            Conducting Key Experiments to Enhance Cadres' Confidence
    During the autumn grain collection, various places also universally convened representatives' conferences at all levels and district and township peasant representative conferences. At the meetings, the representatives enthusiastically discussed the policy of reasonable burden, all realizing the principle that "landlords hiding land means farmers suffer losses." They unanimously resolved to mobilize the masses to squeeze out hidden land, assess yields, implement the policy of reasonable burden, and complete the autumn grain collection task. The representatives resolutely implemented these resolutions after returning to their villages. For example, in the Tenth "bao" of Han Jing Township, First District of Liling, only 3,000 mu of land were initially reported. After the peasant representative conference was convened, the peasant representatives led the masses to squeeze out another 9,000 mu of hidden land. After the Wenjia Township in the Chengguan District of Xiangyin convened a peasant representative conference, more than 1,000 dan of hidden land were found, greatly alleviating the burden on the farmers. While using the peasant representative conferences to mobilize the masses, general areas also used the old "bao-jia" personnel, first publicly pointing out the crimes and mistakes of certain people in the past, and then ordering them to honestly handle affairs under the supervision of the masses and atone for their crimes. In the Tenth "bao" of Chunjiang Township, First District of You County, due to the combination of mobilizing the masses and using the old "bao-jia" personnel, more than 2,000 mu of hidden land were squeezed out, exceeding the original assigned task by 100,000 jin.
    In general, the autumn grain collection work in various places was also combined with suppressing bandits and establishing local armed forces, ensuring the stability of social order and enabling the autumn grain collection work to proceed smoothly. For example, the banditry in the Second and Third Districts of Wugang was relatively serious, so the cadres formed armed work teams, combined with the autumn grain collection, and mobilized the masses to suppress bandits, which greatly improved the masses' enthusiasm for paying grain.
            Farmers Spontaneously Compete, Women and Children Send Grain
    Due to the above reasons, the farmers actively paid grain. They said that this year's grain was "victory grain," "liberation grain," and "overturn-the-old-system grain." Even women and children participated in sending grain. In some areas, the masses spontaneously competed with each other, which accelerated the progress of grain payment. During the collection, many evil bullies and landlords attempted to delay grain payment, and some cadres also had the idea of "taking a breather." The leadership has promptly instructed corrections and launched ideological struggle against landlords who delayed grain payment. For example, Xiong Fancheng, a landlord in the Third District of Pingjiang, refused to pay public grain on the grounds that the burden was too heavy. The masses reasoned with him and calculated his accounts in person, proving that his burden did not exceed the burden ratio. Xiong was speechless and paid the public grain within three days. Other landlords, seeing that they could not deny it, also began to pay grain.
    Also, when the autumn grain collection entered the stage of grain delivery and storage, various places paid attention to checking the implementation of policies and correcting deviations. For example, in the Fifth "bao" of Tiejiang Township, Fourth District of Liling, when assessing the burden on "ke tian" (land owned by people from other "bao" in this "bao"), burdens were assigned regardless of the class composition of the owners. After inspection, the burden on "ke tian" was appropriately reduced in accordance with the policy. Initially, Xiangyin County, due to cadres neglecting to mobilize the masses to squeeze out hidden land, attempted to complete the task by adopting the erroneous method of "adding but not subtracting," resulting in some areas having a burden surface as narrow as 28 to 40 percent, with the widest being only 50 percent. After the leadership pointed this out, the burden surface was expanded to 60 to 70 percent in accordance with the policy, and appropriate adjustments were made for individual landlords whose burdens were too heavy.

    各界代表会议认真推动
    湖南公粮开始入仓
    剿匪、反霸、查黑田、评产量、注意检查政策执行情况，推动了秋征顺利开展。
    【本报讯】湖南省秋征工作自去年十月中旬开始，截至本月下旬为止，长沙、益阳、邵阳三专区已基本上完成任务；常德、衡阳、零陵三专区正缴粮入仓。当秋征工作开始时，从老区来的干部对新区情况了解不够，缺乏新区工作经验，盲目认为负担过重，以致完成任务信心不高；领导上针对这一情况进行重点试验。常德专区重点工作组在常德县三区，即平乡三保发动群众民主评议的结果，超过原派任务一万斤，而且完全合乎政策；临湘县领导同志亲自掌握一区三保工作，挤出地主大批黑田，使该保负担由总产量的百分之二十四点五减至百分之十七点九，减轻了农民负担；领导上将这些经验及时传播出去，大大提高了干部的工作信心，认识到只要发动群众挤出地主黑田，查出确实产量，并不难完成任务。
            进行重点试验提高干部信心
    在秋征中，各地还普遍召开了各界代表会及区乡农代会，会上代表们热烈讨论了合理负担政策，均认识到“地主瞒田、农民吃亏”的道理，一致决议发动群众挤黑田、评产量，贯彻合理负担政策，完成秋征任务。各代表回乡后即坚决执行。如醴陵一区汉景乡十保，原来只报田三千亩，召开农代会后，农民代表又带领群众挤出黑田九千亩。湘阴城关区文家乡召开农代会后，共查出黑田一千多担，大大减轻了农民负担。与运用农代会发动群众的同时，一般地区并利用旧保甲人员，首先当众指出其过去某些人的罪恶和错误，然后责令他们在群众监督下老老实实办事，立功赎罪。攸县一区春江乡十保由于发动群众与利用旧保甲人员相结合，结果挤出黑地两千余亩，使征粮超过原派任务十万斤。
    各地秋征工作，一般还都结合了剿匪及建立地方武装，保证了社会秩序的安定，使秋征工作得以顺利进行。如武岗二、三区匪患较严重，干部乃组成武装工作队，结合秋征，发动群众剿匪，大大提高了群众缴粮情绪。
            农民自发挑战妇女儿童送粮
    由于以上种种原因，农民们都踊跃缴粮，他们说：今年缴的粮是“胜利粮”、“解放粮”、“翻身粮”，连妇女儿童也纷纷参加送粮；有些地区群众自发的互相挑战，更加速了缴粮的进度。在征收中不少恶霸地主企图拖延缴粮，部分干部中也存在“松一口气”的思想，领导上已及时指示纠正，并发动群众对拖延缴粮地主进行了说理斗争。如平江三区地主熊范成，借口负担过重不缴公粮，群众当面给他说理算账，证明了他的负担并未超过负担比例，熊理屈词穷，三天以内即将公粮缴出，其他地主见无法抵赖，也开始缴粮。
    又当秋征进入缴粮入仓阶段时，各地均曾注意检查执行政策情况并纠正偏向。如醴陵四区铁江乡五保评议客田（即外保人在本保的田地）负担时，不分业主阶级成份一律分派。经过检查后，按照政策适当减轻了客田负担。湘阴县最初由于干部忽视发动群众挤黑田，企图采取错误的“加上不加下”的办法完成任务，结果有些地区负担面曾窄到百分之二十八至四十，宽的也不过百分之五十，经领导上指出后，均按照政策将负担面扩大到百分之六十至七十，个别地主负担过重者均予适当调整。
