    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 23rd: Since Tianjin's liberation a year ago, middle schools have achieved considerable progress after rectification and reform. Tianjin now has 56 public and private middle schools, with 1,532 teachers and staff; and 25,255 students, an increase of 3,871 over pre-liberation numbers. Most of the new students are children of workers and peasants. In the early days of liberation, there were phenomena of laxity and lack of discipline in various schools. This has been overcome through persuasion by the education authorities and the assistance of the Communist Youth League and student unions. The Tianjin education authorities also cooperated with the Tianjin Federation of Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff to organize three training courses for teachers and staff, with a total of 2,364 primary and secondary school teachers and staff participating in the study. Summer tutoring classes were established for students, with more than 10,000 students participating. Through summer study, teachers, staff, and students have made progress in their thinking. After last summer vacation, the Tianjin Education Bureau convened a middle school education conference, which decided that under the principle of strengthening political and ideological education, a new regular education system should be established and the study of cultural courses should be strengthened, and teaching methods and content should be gradually improved. To realize this policy, the Tianjin Education Bureau organized city-wide educational research associations for political and historical studies, and Chinese language studies, so that teachers could carry out New Democratic political education when teaching cultural courses. At the same time, teachers and students in various schools, under the slogan of "unity between teachers and students, mutual growth in teaching and learning," conducted criticism and self-criticism, improved teaching attitudes and learning methods, and students consciously abide by learning discipline, enabling close unity between teachers and students, and considerable achievements have been made in both teaching and learning. However, there are still some problems in Tianjin's secondary education that need to be solved. The main problems are that some private schools do not have a sufficient understanding of the policies of the People's Government, emphasize the principal's responsibility system, and are unwilling to allow students and progressive teachers to participate in school management; a small number of teachers still adhere to old teaching methods and do not seek progress; and in terms of curriculum, the content is heavy and there is a bias towards science and engineering over humanities. These shortcomings need to be further corrected through continued efforts.
    [Report from this newspaper] After a year of efforts, secondary education in Shenyang has initially embarked on a new, regularized path. There are now 19 municipal middle schools and normal schools in the city, with 11,781 students; and 4 private middle schools, with 1,990 students. This year, worker-peasant accelerated middle schools and one-year short-term teacher training classes and on-the-job teacher rotation training classes will be established, and three new junior middle schools will be set up. In addition to worker-peasant middle schools, each municipal secondary school has determined enrollment (spring) plans, planning to enroll 6,200 new high school and junior high school students, 600 new students in intermediate normal schools and short-term teacher training classes, and the first phase of rotation training classes will enroll 300 young intellectuals. When recruiting students, all schools will facilitate the enrollment of worker-peasant youth and children of workers and peasants, and absorb a large number of them.
    Last year, the focus of middle school education in the city was to improve school leadership and transform the thinking of teachers and students. Last spring, some Kuomintang secret agents and former Kuomintang principals with serious corruption were removed; and in accordance with the New Democratic education policy, preliminary reforms were implemented in school organization, systems, curriculum, and teaching, and school leadership was strengthened. Through two teacher research conferences and two youth academies during the winter and summer vacations, as well as daily political study, the ideological progress of teachers and students was significant. The vast majority of teachers changed their erroneous thinking and so-called middle-of-the-road line and employment views. Some teachers have studied and passed the use of various subject teaching to infuse political and ideological education, and have made new creations in teaching. The revolutionary enthusiasm among students is high, and there are many requests to join the Communist Youth League. At the same time, various schools have initially corrected the tendency of excessive non-learning activities and strengthened the study of cultural courses. The average grade of general schools has changed from two-thirds failing to two-thirds passing.
    The current problem is that the cultural level of students is too low. There are even third-year junior high school students who do not know how to remove parentheses in mathematics, and senior high school students who answer "Hankou is in Jiangxi," exhibiting ignorance. This is mainly the result of the reactionary and corrupt education during the puppet Manchurian and Kuomintang rule, but it is also related to the current shortcomings in teaching. Because most teachers have not yet broken away from dogmatism and the injection-style teaching method; the political and professional level of some teachers is too low; and some teachers are still talking about erroneous bourgeois views such as "geography determines life."
    In addition, student mobility is too high. After Shenyang's liberation the year before last, about three to four thousand students entered cadre schools or left school for other reasons, and the number of people who left school last year also reached more than two thousand. The occurrence of this phenomenon is partly due to the economic reasons of student families, and on the other hand, it is due to the lack of adherence to the regular school system. Some schools do not enroll students during vacations, and some departments transfer students to work at any time, resulting in students leaving school without going through withdrawal or leave procedures, forming a habit of disorganization and indiscipline. This phenomenon hinders the progress of regular education and needs to be overcome urgently in the future.

    津沈两市中等学校初建新的正规制度
    部分教师沿袭旧的教学方法，急待改进。
    【新华社天津二十三日电】天津市解放一年来，中等学校经整顿改造后，已有相当成绩。天津市现在共有公私立中学五十六所，教职员一千五百三十二人；学生二万五千二百五十五人，比解放前增加了三千八百七十一人。新入学者大部分是工农子弟。解放初期，各校曾发生散漫无纪律现象，经过教育当局的说服教育和青年团、学生会的协助，现在已经克服。天津市教育当局又曾与中小学教职员联合会合作，先后组织了三次教职员讲习班，参加学习的中小学教职员共有二千三百六十四人。对于学生则设立了暑期补习班，参加的学生共有一万多人。通过暑期的学习、教职员、学生思想上都有进步。去年暑假后，天津市教育局曾召开中学教育会议，决定在加强政治思想教育原则下，要建立新的正规教育制度和加强文化课的学习，并逐步改进教学方法和内容。为实现这一方针，天津市教育局曾组织全市性的政治和历史、国文各科教育研究会，使教员能在教授文化课时，进行新民主主义的政治教育。同时各校教员、学生在“师生团结，教学相长”的口号下，进行批评和自我批评，改进了教学态度和学习的方法，学生也自觉地遵守学习纪律，使师生间得以密切团结，教和学都获得相当成绩。但目前天津市的中等教育还存在着一些问题有待解决。主要是有些私立学校对人民政府的政策认识不够，强调校长负责制，不愿学生和进步的教员参加学校管理工作；少数教师还停留在旧的教学方法上，不求进步；在课程方面则分量繁重，并有重理轻文的偏向。这些缺点，还有待进一步的努力纠正。
    【本报讯】沈阳市中等教育经一年来努力，已初步走上了新型正规化的道路。全市现有市立中学及师范十九校，学生一万一千七百八十一名；私立中学四校，学生一千九百九十名。本年将创办工农速成中学和一年制的短期师资训练班与在职师资轮训班，新设初级中学三校。除工农中学外，各市立中等学校已确定招生（春季）计划，计招收高、初中新生六千二百名，中级师范与短期师资班新生六百名，轮训班第一期招收青年知识分子三百名。各校招生时将给工农青年与工农子女以入学方便，大量吸收其入学。
    去年该市中学教育的工作重心为改进学校领导与改造师生思想。去春曾撤换了一些国民党特务分子和有严重贪污腐化行为的原国民党时期的校长；并按照新民主主义教育方针，实行了学校组织、制度、课程与教学等方面的初步改革，加强了学校领导。经过寒假和暑假两次教师研究会和两次青年学园以及日常政治学习，教师与学生的思想进步显著。绝大部分教师改变了错误思想和所谓中间路线与雇佣观点。某些教师已研究通过各科教学来贯串政治思想教育，并在教学上有新的创造，学生间革命热情高涨，要求加入青年团的特别多。同时，各校初步纠正了非学习活动过多的偏向，加强了文化课的学习，一般学校平均成绩由三分之二不及格变为三分之二及格。
    目前存在的问题，是学生文化水平太低。甚至有初中三年级学生在数学上还不会脱括弧，高中三年级学生答“汉口在江西”等无知现象。这主要是伪满与国民党统治时期反动腐败教育的恶果，但与目前教学上的缺点也有关系。因为多数教员还没有摆脱教条主义、注入式的教学方式；一部分教员政治、业务水平太低；有的教师还在讲“地理决定人生”等资产阶级的错误观点。
    此外，学生流动性太大，前年沈阳市解放后，约有三、四千学生入干部学校或其他原因离校，去年流动人数也达二千余人。这种现象的发生，一部分是由于学生家庭经济原因，另方面则由于坚持正规学制不够，有些学校不在假期招生，有些部门随时抽调学生参加工作，造成学生不办退学、休学手续即擅自离校的无组织无纪律习惯。这种现象妨害了正规教育的进行，是今后亟须注意克服的。
