An area stretching 2,800 li from Shanhaiguan in the west to Yingkou in the east, then south to Lushun, and from Lushun northeast to Andong, curving around the entire Liaodong Peninsula with the Bohai and Yellow Sea straits (a marine area of 139,109 square kilometers), as well as inland rivers like the Heilongjiang, Songhua River, Nen River, Ussuri River, and lakes such as Xingkai Lake (half Chinese, half Soviet), and Jingbo Lake. Fishery resources are extremely abundant, with an average annual yield of around 100,000 tons, peaking at 174,000 tons in 1944. There are over 60 species of fish. Well-known marine saltwater fish include yellow croaker, knife fish, prawns, green shrimp, and silver fish, among others. Hairtail shrimp, accounting for more than one-third of the total marine fish production, is not only a common non-staple food for the local people but also used to produce large and small dried shrimp for export. Among freshwater fish from inland rivers, the large kaluga sturgeon produced in the Ussuri River and Heilongjiang River is the most precious, previously sold in Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. The rich fishery resources of the Northeast are a significant natural wealth for China, greatly important for improving people's lives and increasing nutrition. However, due to the invasion of Japanese imperialism, especially the maritime fishery which suffered from pirate harassment and devastation by the Japanese invaders for 30 years, production was greatly hindered. After "August 15th," the Liaodong and Liaohai areas were successively occupied by Kuomintang bandit troops, and the fishery was severely devastated. Fishermen could not bear the exorbitant taxes and levies and were forced to cease operations in large numbers, resulting in a sharp decline in production. In particular, the Liaodong Bay fishing area in Liaoxi Province was almost completely destroyed under the nearly three-year plunder by the Kuomintang bandits. For example, in Huludao, Jinxi County, more than two-thirds of the over 400 fishing households were forced to shut down due to the looting and extortion by the Kuomintang bandits. The proportion of shutdowns in other areas was no less than this.

After the Yellow Sea fishing area in the eastern Liaodong Peninsula was liberated in the spring of 1947, the People's Government immediately invested and loaned more than 1 billion yuan and provided fishermen with large quantities of supplies, resolving the difficulties of some fishermen and enabling them to resume production. The output that year reached 15,000 tons, and last year it increased to 26,645 tons. This spring, the People's Government again loaned more than 17 billion yuan and 6 million jin of grain, and supplied more than 3 million jin of salt at low prices, enabling 5,507 households with 65,000 fishermen to repair or purchase new fishing gear and set sail for fishing. Due to the universally high enthusiasm of fishermen for production, output increased by 14 percent compared to last year. After the liberation of the Liaodong Bay fishing area in the western part of the peninsula last winter, the People's Government immediately loaned 2.83 billion yuan and 756,600 jin of grain, enabling 2,000 fishing households to gather the 24,538 fishing nets and 4,135 fishing hooks that had been idle for a long time, and joyfully steer 1,288 large and small fishing boats into the ocean to fish. Although the typhoon hit during the fish production season, and production was impacted, due to the unanimous and active efforts of the fishermen to resume production, the output has reached 3.5 million jin. With the support of local people's governments, the output of freshwater fish in inland rivers and lakes has increased year by year. In 1948, the output of freshwater fish reached 30,146 tons (excluding Inner Mongolia), accounting for one-third of the total output of 94,000 tons in the entire Northeast. The fishery in the Lushun-Dalian area is also gradually recovering, and last year's output had recovered to 17,952 tons, with further increases this year. This year, the total fish production in all fishing areas in the Northeast was 100,500 tons, an increase of 9 percent compared to last year, laying the foundation for further increasing production in the future.

With the recovery and development of the entire economic construction in the Northeast and the need to improve people's lives, the fishery will gradually be valued and further developed. Therefore, the recent First Northeast Aquatic Products Conference adopted a plan to produce 100,920 tons of fish in 1950, including 22,700 tons in Liaoxi, 32,000 tons in Liaodong, 8,000 tons in Songjiang, 17,500 tons in Heilongjiang, 5,500 tons in Jilin, 20,000 tons in Lushun-Dalian, and 3,500 tons in Inner Mongolia. Each province is required to strive to exceed the plan by 10 percent, in order to restore to the peak production of the puppet Manchukuo—174,000 tons—within the next three years.

According to the needs of the recovery and development of the fishery, the leadership of the fishery and the work of organizing fishermen in various places are being gradually strengthened. To this end, the People's Governments of Liaodong, Liaoxi, Heilongjiang, and other provinces have successively established aquatic product bureaus, and the Lushun-Dalian Administrative Office has established aquatic product companies to actively help fishermen organize supply and marketing cooperatives, solve fishermen's production and sales difficulties, and have achieved great results. The four branch companies established by the Lushun-Dalian Aquatic Products Company in the Changshan Islands have been abolished in three places due to assisting fishermen in establishing three cooperatives. The 28 fishermen's cooperatives established in Liaodong Province have 10,415 members and 2.8 billion yuan in capital. Liaoxi, Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and other provinces have also organized many fishermen's cooperatives. Songjiang Province has also specially set up cold storage warehouses and canning factories to meet the needs of production and sales. In order to further organize fishermen, develop the fishery, and improve management methods, the Aquatic Products Conference decided to universally organize fishermen's supply and marketing cooperatives, and organize village, district, and county fishermen's associations to strengthen the leadership of fishermen's cooperatives to ensure that they truly meet the needs of production and sales.

    东北渔业概况
    西起山海关东至营口，折而南达旅顺，再自旅顺折向东北之安东，曲折二千八百余里围绕整个辽东半岛的渤、黄两大海峡（海洋面积十三万九千一百零九平方公里），及内地黑龙江、松花江、嫩江、乌苏里江，以及兴凯湖（中苏各半）、镜泊湖等湖池，渔产均极丰富，平均年产在十万吨左右，一九四四年时最高产量曾达十七万四千吨。鱼类有六十余种之多，海洋咸水鱼著名者有黄花鱼、刀黄、对虾、青虾、银鱼等十余种，而占海洋渔产总产量三分之一以上的毛虾，除为本地人民较普遍的副食品，并能制造大小海米，输出外地。内河淡水鱼以乌苏里江和黑龙江所产之大吗蛤鱼最为珍贵，以往曾销于京、津、宁、沪等地。富饶的东北渔产，是中国很大的一笔天然财富，对改善人民生活，增加营养亦有很大意义。但过去因受日本帝国主义的侵略，特别是海洋渔业受日寇海盗侵扰摧残已有三十年之久，生产遭到极大的阻碍。“八一五”后，辽东、辽海地区，因先后被国民党匪军侵占，渔业遭到严重的摧残，渔民不堪苛捐杂税盘剥，而大批歇业，产量大降。尤其是辽西省辽东湾渔区，在国民党匪帮将近三年的搜刮下，摧残殆尽。如锦西县葫芦岛四百余户渔民，由于饱受国民党匪帮的抢劫勒索，三分之二以上停业。其他地区停业者亦不下此比例数。
    辽东半岛东部的黄海渔区，一九四七年春重获解放后，人民政府当即投资及贷款十余亿元，并贷给渔民大批物资，解决了一部分渔民的困难，使渔民得以重新恢复生产，当年产量即达一万五千吨，去年则增加到两万六千六百四十五吨。人民政府今春复又贷款一百七十余亿元，贷粮六百万斤，低价供给食盐三百余万斤、使五千五百零七户六万五千余名渔民修补或新购了渔具，驶船下海捕鱼。由于渔民生产情绪普遍高涨，产量比去年提高百分之十四。半岛西部的辽东湾渔区，去冬解放后，人民政府即贷款二十八亿三千余万元，贷粮七十五万六千余斤，因而两千户渔民得以收拾起歇业已久的二万四千五百三十八片渔网，和四千一百三十五把渔钩，驾大小渔船一千二百八十八只，兴高采烈深入海洋捕鱼，虽值产鱼期遭受台风侵袭，生产受到打击，但因渔民一致积极恢复生产，产量已达到三百五十万斤。内地河湖淡水鱼产，在各地人民政府的扶持下，产量逐年提高。一九四八年淡水鱼产量已达三万零一百四十六吨（不包括内蒙），占全东北总产量九万四千吨的三分之一。旅大地区的渔业，亦在逐渐的恢复，去年产量即已恢复到一万七千九百五十二吨，今年又有增加。今年全东北各渔区共产鱼十万零五百吨，较去年增产百分之九，为今后继续提高产量打下基础。
    随着东北整个经济建设的恢复与发展，及提高人民生活的需要，渔业将逐渐被重视起来，并进一步的向前发展。因此，最近东北第一届水产会议通过了一九五○年产鱼十万零九千二百吨的计划，其中辽西为二万二千七百吨、辽东三万二千吨、松江八千吨、黑龙江一万七千五百吨，吉林五千五百吨、旅大两万吨、内蒙三千五百吨。要求各省尽量争取超过计划百分之十，以求在今后三年内恢复到伪满最高产量——十七万四千吨。
    根据渔业的恢复与发展的需要，各地对渔业的领导及组织渔民工作，在逐步的加强。为此，辽东、辽西、黑龙江等省人民政府先后成立了水产局，旅大行政公署设立了水产公司，积极帮助渔民组织供销合作社，为渔民解决产销困难，获得了很大的成绩。旅大水产公司在长山列岛设立的四个分公司，由于协助渔民成立起三个合作社，现已撤销三处。辽东省已建立起的二十八个渔民合作社，社员达一万零四百一十五人，资金二十八亿元。辽西、黑龙江、松江等省亦组织了不少渔民合作社，松江省并特设冷冻机仓库和罐头工厂，以应产销的需要。为进一步把渔民组织起来，发展渔业，改进经营方法，水产会议决定普遍组织渔民供销合作社，并组织村、区、县渔民会，加强对渔民合作社的领导，以保证真正适应产销的需要。
