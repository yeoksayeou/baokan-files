    Mid-Month Export Settlement Reaches 3 Billion
    [Our Newspaper] Guangzhou's export trade figures are rising sharply.

This exceeds the average of 8 million Hong Kong dollars per ten-day period during the peak export months of the Kuomintang reactionary period. The most exported goods are animals and their products, and plant products. The export figures for the middle of this month also exceeded those of the first ten days by 83.59 percent. The foreign exchange market is also stabilizing, with frequent transactions. The highest transaction price for Hong Kong dollars was 2,932 yuan, and the lowest was 2,890 yuan. All foreign exchange sold was from export proceeds, mainly from tea and oil.
