    Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Assists Suburban Farmers in Production: Supply and Marketing Groups to be Universally Established in Villages
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative is supplying suburban farmers with a large quantity of various means of production to support agricultural and sideline production in the suburbs. In the past year, it supplied more than 2,828,000 jin of fertilizer and more than 18,000 jin of arsenic (insecticide); lent and adjusted 500,500 jin of wheat seeds; in conjunction with water conservancy promotion, the cooperative lent 692 waterwheels, 1,000 Leghorn chickens were lent, 195,000 jin of sweet potato seedlings were stored, and 19 wells were dug; 540,000 jin of rice, 210,000 jin of miscellaneous grains, and 650,000 jin of peanuts were purchased. In addition, it organized suburban epidemic prevention teams to carry out preventive injections for livestock and poultry, injecting a total of 33,885 chickens and 66 pigs. Since the beginning of winter, it has also mobilized farmers to organize sideline production, boiling saltpeter and making straw ropes. In November, a total of 80 saltpeter boiling groups were organized, with 102 saltpeter pots, involving 757 households and more than 1,000 people. Each pot produced 400 jin of saltpeter per day and night, and after expenses, a profit of 1 shi and 2 dou of corn could be obtained, and each person could be divided into 17 or 18 jin of corn per day. It is estimated that saltpeter boiling alone can solve the livelihood problems of more than 10,000 people. A total of 275 straw rope machines were organized, each machine producing 6 bundles of straw ropes per day and night (each bundle containing 5 coils, each coil being 30 zhang). After deducting expenses, 2.4 jin of corn could be obtained. In the future, in order to make the relationship between farmers and cooperatives closer, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative plans to universally establish supply and marketing groups in various villages and to establish supply and marketing cooperatives with a focus in larger towns and markets as bases for connecting the supply and marketing groups in various villages, so as to systematically organize the entire suburban supply and marketing network.
