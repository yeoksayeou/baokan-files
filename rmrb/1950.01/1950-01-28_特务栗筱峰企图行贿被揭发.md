    【Beijing News】Although Kuomintang special agent Li Xiaofeng had registered at the No. 1 Outer Precinct of the Public Security Bureau, he still acted extremely cunningly and suspiciously. In order to thoroughly educate him and make him reflect, the Public Security Precinct ordered him to report three times a day. However, not only did Li Xiaofeng not repent sincerely, but he also resorted to tricks to bribe government personnel. On December 27th of last year, when he was reporting, he took the opportunity to say to Liu Juncai, a cadre at the registration office of the No. 1 Outer Precinct: "My Bright Restaurant has been sold. The referral fee is forty bolts of foreign cloth, and each referrer can get four or five bolts. I want to include you as one of them. I will never let anyone know about this, even if it means death! You can have money or cloth, whichever you want, and put it in anyone's shop." After hearing what he said, Liu Juncai understood his intention to bribe and immediately severely criticized and educated him, and reported the matter to the precinct for handling. Regarding Li Xiaofeng's cunning and insidious behavior, the No. 1 Outer Precinct, in addition to ordering him to confess his bribery motives, also held a general meeting of all registered KMT agents to expose him and educate them to understand that only by honestly confessing and repenting can they gain the people's trust, and that any other path is a dead end. Liu Juncai, a cadre of the No. 1 Outer Precinct, upheld a correct stance and acted impartially and honestly, fully demonstrating the excellent qualities of a people's police officer, and is worthy of commendation.

    特务栗筱峰企图行贿被揭发
    【北京讯】国民党特务栗筱峰虽已在公安局外一分局登记，但表现仍极狡猾鬼祟。该公安分局为彻底教育，使之反省，乃令其三天汇报一次。但栗筱峰不但不痛自悔悟，反施用诡计，向政府工作人员行贿。去年十二月二十七日他在汇报时乘机向外分一局登记处干部刘俊才说：“我的光明饭店卖了，介绍费是四十匹洋布，每个介绍人可得四、五匹。我想给你也算上一份。这事我决不让人知道，杀头有我呢！你要钱要布都可以，放在谁的铺子里都行。”刘俊才听了他讲的话，已明白他行贿的企图，当即严予申斥教育，并报告分局处理。外一分局对栗筱峰此种狡猾阴谋行为，除令其坦白行贿动机外，并召开全体登记党特分子大会，予以揭露，教育他们认识：唯有老实坦白悔过，才能取得人民信任，任何其他路子都走不通的。外一分局干部刘俊才，坚持正确立场及奉公洁廉，充分表现了人民警卫员的优良品质，是值得嘉勉的。
