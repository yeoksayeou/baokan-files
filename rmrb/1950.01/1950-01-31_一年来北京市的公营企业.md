Public Enterprises in Beijing Over the Past Year
    Beijing Municipal People's Government Research Office
            Takeover and Institutional Adjustment
    Beijing's public enterprises include the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Shijingshan Power Plant, 70th Ordnance Factory, Beijing Machine Factory, Mentougou Coal Mine, Beijing Garment Factory, Beijing Automobile Repair Factory, Qinghe Woolen Mill, Yanjing Paper Mill, China People's Printing Factory, General Agricultural Machinery Factory, all factories affiliated with the Beijing Enterprise Company, telecommunications and postal services, as well as municipal enterprises such as tap water, trams, and buses in the city. At the beginning of the liberation, the Military Control Commission took over each one. First, the original enterprise structure was maintained. For the original employees, the average actual salary of the three months before liberation was used as the basis to maintain their original positions and salaries. This stabilized the internal affairs of the enterprises, enabling them to resume work quickly and in an orderly manner. Then, some preliminary reforms were carried out in the enterprises, retaining and improving the purely economic and production-necessary institutions, and abolishing and reforming the institutions with the nature of political power or bureaucracy. The large enterprises related to the national economic lifeline, such as steel, electricity, machinery, ordnance, and printing factories, were unified into the state-owned industrial systems according to the new needs. Those related to the people's livelihood and production construction of the city, such as woolen, paper, glass, ice-making, pharmaceutical, brick, kiln, iron, electrical, bus, and tap water, were transferred to municipal operation. Appropriate adjustments were also made to the personnel and institutions in each enterprise. After systematic and efficient takeover, Beijing's public enterprises were all transferred into the hands of the people, the lives of employees were guaranteed, and industrial production gradually recovered.
            Restoration and Development
    Due to closely relying on the working class, Beijing's public enterprises not only fully recovered but also achieved preliminary development in the past year. Taking the municipally-operated industries in Beijing as an example, when the People's Government took over, only six of the fourteen public factories were operating. The Yanjing Paper Mill, the New Glass Factory, and the New Pharmaceutical Factory had all been shut down for several months or years. Now, all twenty production units are fully operational, and all have generally exceeded the pre-liberation production levels. In addition, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant launched a new record movement last year. With the active suggestions of Soviet experts, the technology was improved, breaking the conservative views on production leadership. Through the efforts of all employees and the close cooperation of the Party, government, labor union, and the working class, a high degree of initiative was brought into play. In December last year, the daily iron output reached 331 tons, setting a new record in the history of the plant. The output exceeded the highest output during the Kuomintang rule by 73.3 percent. The Beijing Machine Factory was formed by the merger of several machinery repair shops before liberation. Since June last year, it has been transformed into a peaceful industry, producing water cranes (for trains) and automatic coal feeders. The machine utilization rate of its general factory is now 80 to 90 percent, while before liberation it was only 20 to 30 percent.
    In the process of recovery and development, the great contribution of the workers and staff is extremely obvious. Employees of the Shijingshan Power Plant, bus company, and other units had contributed a lot of equipment. When workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant repaired the largest blast furnace in North China at the end of May last year, they shortened the working hours by one-third compared with before liberation, enabling the plant to fully resume production by the end of June. When cleaning the hot blast stove, workers Cheng Degui, Hu Jirei, and others worked in the furnace at a high temperature of 120 degrees Celsius, and refused to rest even after being injured and suffocated. Lin Fukun, a worker at the People's Paper Mill, repaired the water pipes lying in the muddy ditch to enable the factory to resume work as soon as possible. In terms of improving labor productivity, when completing the winter clothing task, the workers at the front car of the Beijing Garment Factory made 14 sets per day, exceeding the plan by one time. The workers in the rear car made 60 sets, exceeding the plan by more than one time. When the tram company’s repair factory completed the 100-vehicle campaign for the first time, it took seven workers to complete the copper head that had previously taken 55 workers. Workers and staff in various factories not only actively worked and increased labor intensity to increase output, but also improved technology and created tools. Fu Wanyu, a worker at the 70th Ordnance Factory, created a helical gear cutter, increasing output by nine times. Liu Guisheng, Li Yuqi, and other workers from the Water Supply Company self-made a lead furnace, which saved 80 percent of coke and 90 percent of firewood compared to the old furnace. In order to overcome the difficulty of lacking machine parts, Tang Minghan of Shijingshan Power Plant manufactured high-voltage fuses with the same effect as American goods. The tram company's repair factory director and workers self-made fire glass rings and automatic brake boxes that they had not made for more than 20 years. In terms of streamlining and saving, the Qinghe Woolen Mill burned 265.5 tons of coal in June 1948, but used more gas in June last year, but only burned 92.3 tons of coal. Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant saved 0.189 kg of coal per kilowatt-hour, saving a total of 253,258 tons of coal last year. In addition, various factories have initially established work systems and management systems, and workers have voluntarily formulated labor discipline. Relying on these, the capital's public enterprises have moved from recovery to development, laying the foundation for further development in 1950.
            Source of Strength
    The active role and enthusiasm of the working masses is mainly promoted by three aspects:
    First, the working class has raised its awareness and fully developed its production wisdom. According to statistics in December: There are 59,000 employees in public enterprises, and 87 percent of them have joined the trade union. More than 22,000 people participated in workers' night schools, training courses, literacy classes, and summer studies. Mass meetings, small newspapers, wall newspapers, broadcasting, movies, and entertainment have all played an educational role for the working masses. After liberation, workers in various factories actively participated in the Communist Party of China and the New Democratic Youth League, becoming the backbone of the production front.
    Second, the lives of employees have obtained basic guarantees. Due to the timely payment of wages and the general establishment of consumer cooperatives, which eliminated the exploitation of merchants, life was stable, which reduced workers' concerns.
    Third, some factories mobilized workers to actively participate in democratic management and used self-criticism to oppose bureaucracy, uniting employees. Although factory management committees have only been established in eight enterprises, it has been proven that whether workers' production enthusiasm can be developed is greatly related to whether democratic management is implemented.
            Strengthen Leadership, Take a Further Step
    Due to the correct leadership of the People's Government and the efforts of all employees, the production of Beijing's public enterprises has recovered to the pre-liberation level and made some progress, laying the foundation for the construction of Beijing's public enterprises in the future. However, in the past year, there are still many serious shortcomings in operation and management. Some administrative heads of factories have not made necessary reforms to the original outdated institutions, systems, and styles. Some responsible cadres are not good at combining political work with economic work. Some responsible cadres of trade unions have not yet realized that trade unions are schools for learning how to manage production. In order to further improve the production of Beijing's public enterprises, it is necessary to earnestly rely on the working class and implement democratic management under the principle of "Public Production First"; on the other hand, determine production plans and strengthen enterprise management. Then, under the combination of democratic management and enterprise management, establish a sound wage system, labor protection regulations, and strictly prevent the sabotage of secret agents, so that the public industry in the capital will steadily move forward.

    一年来北京市的公营企业
    北京市人民政府研究室
            接管和机构调整
    北京市的公营企业，包括石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂、七十兵工厂、北京机器厂、门头沟煤矿、北京被服厂、北京汽车修配厂、清河制呢厂、燕京造纸厂、中国人民印刷厂、农业机械总厂、北京企业公司所属各工厂，电信邮政以及本市自来水、电车、公共汽车等市政企业。解放之初即由军事管制委员会一一接管，首先维持原来的企业机构，对原有的职工，按解放前三个月平均实际薪资为基础，维持原职原薪。这样安定了企业内部，使之能够有秩序地迅速复工。接着在企业中进行若干初步的改革，保留和改良其纯经济性质的、生产所必需的机构，裁撤和改革带政权性质的或官僚主义化的机构。其有关国家经济命脉的大企业，如钢铁、电力、机器、兵工、印刷等工厂，按照新的需要统一到国营各产业系统里去。其有关本市人民生活和生产建设的，如制呢、造纸、玻璃、制冰、制药砖、窑、铁工、电工、公共汽车、自来水等则划归市营。各企业中的人事和机构也作了适当的调整，经过有系统有效率地接管，北京的公营企业全部转入人民手中，职工生活获得保障，工业生产逐步恢复。
            恢复和发展
    由于紧密依靠工人阶级，北京市的公营企业，在去年一年间，不只全面恢复了，而且获得初步发展。以北京市营的工业来说，人民政府接管时，十四个公营工厂里，开工的只有六个。燕京造纸厂、新建玻璃厂、新建制药厂，都是停工了几个月或几年的。到现在，二十个生产单位都全部开工，而且普遍的超过了解放前的生产水平。此外，石景山钢铁厂去年展开新纪录运动，经苏联专家的积极建议，改进技术后，打破了生产领导上的保守观点，经全体职工努力和党政工团的密切配合，工人阶级发挥了高度的积极性。在去年十二月日产铁曾达到过三百三十一吨，创造了该厂有史以来的新纪录。产量超出国民党统治时期最高产量百分之七十三·三。北京机器厂是解放前的几个修械所合并而成的。从去年六月已转业为和平工业，出产水鹤（火车用）和自动给煤机。它的总厂的机器开动率，现在是百分之八十到九十，解放前只是百分之二十到三十。
    在恢复与发展的过程中，职工的伟大贡献，是极其明显的。石景山发电厂、公共汽车公司等单位职工，曾献交过不少器材。石景山钢铁厂工人去年五月底修好华北最大炼铁炉时，比解放前缩短工时三分之一，使该厂在六月底全面恢复生产。热风炉清灰时，工人程德贵、胡基瑞等在摄氏一百二十度高温下入炉工作，在受伤和薰昏后还不肯休息。人民造纸厂工人林福崐，为使工厂早日复工，曾仰卧地沟烂泥上接修水管。在劳动生产率提高方面，北京被服厂在完成冬装任务时，前车工人每日做出十四套，超出计划一倍。后车工人做到六十套，超出计划一倍多。电车公司修造厂在第一次完成百辆车运动时，曾经用七个工完成以前定五十五工的铜头。各厂职工，不只积极工作、增加劳动强度来提高产量，而且改良技术，创造工具。七十兵工厂工人傅万煜创造斜齿车刀，提高产量九倍。自来水公司工人刘桂生、李玉启等，自制化铅炉，比旧式炉子省百分之八十的焦炭，百分之九十的木柴。为了克服机件缺乏的困难，石景山发电厂唐明汉自造了和美货效能相同的高压保险丝。电车公司修造厂长和工人自制了二十几年从来没做过的火玻璃圈和自动闸盒。在精简节约方面，清河制呢厂一九四八年六月烧煤二百六十五点五吨，去年六月用的煤气更多，却只烧了九十二点三吨煤。石景山钢铁厂每度电省煤零点一八九公斤，去年一年共省煤二十五万三千二百五十八吨。此外，各厂初步建立了工作制度、管理制度，工人自动订立了劳动纪律。依靠了这些，首都的公营企业从恢复走到了发展，为一九五○年的进一步发展打下了基础。
            力量的源泉
    工人群众积极发挥创造作用与劳动热情，主要是由三方面促成的：
    第一、工人阶级觉悟提高、生产智慧充分发挥。根据十二月份统计：公营企业共有职工五万九千人，参加工会的占百分之八十七。两万二千多人参加工人夜校、学习班、识字班及暑期学习。群众大会、小报、墙报、广播、电影、娱乐都起了对工人群众的教育作用。解放后各工厂工人踊跃参加中国共产党和新民主主义青年团，成了生产战线上的骨干。
    第二、职工生活获得了基本的保障。由于按时发给工资、普遍设立消费合作社，免除商人中间剥削，生活稳定，从而减少了工人的顾虑。
    第三、一部分工厂发动工人积极参加民主管理，用自我批评来反对官僚主义，使职工团结一致。工厂管理委员会虽然只在八个企业中建立起来，但事实证明，工人生产积极性能否发扬，与是否实行民主管理，关系很大。
            加强领导，再进一步
    北京市公营企业的生产，由于人民政府正确的领导，全体职工的努力，已经恢复了解放前水平并获得若干进展，打下了今后北京公营企业建设的基础。但一年中，在经营管理上，还有许多严重缺点。有些工厂的行政负责人，对原有陈腐的机构、制度和作风，还未作必要的改革。有些负责干部，还不善于把政治工作与经济工作结合起来。有些工会的负责干部，还没有了解到工会是学习管理生产的学校。为了使北京公营企业的生产，再提高一步，必需在“公营生产第一”的方针下，一面认真依靠工人阶级，实行民主管理；一面确定生产计划，加强经营企业化。然后在民主管理和经营企业化的结合之下，树立健全的工资制度、劳保条例，严防特务的破坏，使首都的公营工业，稳步地向前迈进一步。（附图表）
