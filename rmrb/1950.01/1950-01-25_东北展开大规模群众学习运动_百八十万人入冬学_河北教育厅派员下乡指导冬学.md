    Northeast China Launches Large-Scale Mass Learning Movement
    1.8 Million People Enrolled in Winter School
    Hebei Education Department Sends Personnel to Guide Winter School in Rural Areas
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] The winter school movement in Northeast China and Hebei Province has become a large-scale mass learning movement. In Northeast China, as of the end of last December, according to incomplete statistics from the provinces of Liaoxi, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Liaodong, Jilin, and the suburban areas of the three cities of Shenyang, Anshan, and Benxi, 41,384 winter schools have been established, with a total of 1,830,251 students; an increase of more than 600,000 people compared to 1948. In Yushu County alone, there are more than 137,000 winter school students, accounting for 21 percent of the county's population. In Hebei Province, according to incomplete statistics from 54 counties in Dingxian, Handan, Baoding and other special districts, more than 600,000 people have enrolled in schools. In Yuanshi County, 190 out of 196 administrative villages have established winter schools.
    In more than a month of winter school learning, the masses in various places have made progress. In terms of cultural learning, farmers who were originally illiterate can generally recognize 70 to 80 to more than 100 characters, and those with good results can learn more than 300 characters, and at least 40 to 50 characters. In terms of political learning, the general students have initially understood the basic spirit of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, memorized the names of the chairman and vice-chairmen of the Central People's Government, recognized who the "four friends" and "three enemies" are, and learned the national anthem. In some areas of Hebei, after conducting education on production and prosperity in winter schools, farmers have gradually overcome their fear of "standing out" and "eating from the same pot," and are actively preparing for production. For example, in Ershilipu Village, Dingxian County, 16 farmers are preparing to dig wells and buy waterwheels.
    This year's winter school movement has been able to develop widely, mainly because provinces, counties, and cities have made planned preparations in advance. In late November last year, governments at all levels in the Northeast provinces generally convened winter school work conferences; or arranged winter school work through people's congresses. Various places have trained winter school teachers in large numbers in advance. In Liaoxi Province, Northeast China, ten counties collectively trained 2,804 winter school teachers, and Haicheng County in Liaodong collectively trained 1,050 teachers in less than 20 days. Hebei also conducted phased collective training of winter school teachers. According to statistics from 33 counties including Xinle and Hejian, 9,422 teachers were trained. Most provinces and counties in Northeast China have conducted pilot winter school work. For example, in early December last year, the Liaodong Provincial Department of Education transferred 18 cadres to lead 560 students from the provincial teachers' college and provincial secondary normal school to conduct pilot winter school work in Fengcheng, Liaoyang and other counties to create experience. Hebei Province also paid attention to summarizing and promoting the experience of running winter schools in the past. Secondly, cadres, party members, and league members took the lead in enrolling in schools, and various forms of publicity and mobilization were carried out in advance to break the masses' various concerns about going to school, and to realize the benefits of going to winter school, so that a large number of men and women enthusiastically enrolled in schools. The learning mood is generally very high. Many people in Northeast China voluntarily contributed money, oil, and firewood to solve the winter school's funding. In Hebei, because winter schools can be combined with production, many parents who were afraid of delaying production and prevented their children from enrolling have also turned to urging their children to go to school.
    In order to further the winter school movement, the Education Department of the Hebei Provincial Government sent five cadres to Dingxian and other places in the middle of this month to strengthen the guidance of winter schools. The education section of some county governments also organized inspection groups to go deep into the villages to conduct winter school inspections and solve various problems.

### 东北展开大规模群众学习运动  百八十万人入冬学  河北教育厅派员下乡指导冬学

    东北展开大规模群众学习运动
    百八十万人入冬学
    河北教育厅派员下乡指导冬学
    【本报讯】东北区及河北省各地的冬学运动，已成为大规模的群众学习运动。东北截至去年十二月底，据辽西、松江、黑龙江、辽东、吉林等省及沈阳、鞍山、本溪三个市的郊区不完全统计，已建立冬学四万一千三百八十四处，共有冬学学生一百八十三万零二百五十一人；比一九四八年增加六十余万人。其中仅榆树一个县即有冬学学生十三万七千余人，占全县人口百分之二十一。河北省据定县、邯郸、保定等专区五十四个县的不完全统计，已有六十余万人入学。元氏县一百九十六个行政村，已有一百九十个村建立了冬学。
    各地群众在一个多月来的冬学学习中，已获得成绩。在文化学习方面，原来不识字的农民，一般已能识七、八十到一百多个字，成绩好的学到三百多字，最少亦能识四、五十个字。在政治学习方面，一般学员均初步明白了人民政协共同纲领的基本精神，记住了中央人民政府正副主席姓名，并认清了“四个朋友”及“三个敌人”是谁，学会了国歌。河北有些地区，在冬学里进行生产发家的教育后，农民逐渐克服了怕“冒尖”和怕“吃大锅饭”的思想，积极准备生产。如定县二十里铺村，有十六户农民准备打井买水车。
    今年冬学运动，所以能够广泛开展，主要由于各省、县、市事先有计划地作了准备工作。东北各省各级政府，在去年十一月下旬，曾普遍召开冬学工作会议；或通过人民代表会，布置冬学工作。各地事先均大批训练冬学教员。东北辽西省十个县，集训冬学教员二千八百零四名，辽东海城一县不到二十天，集训了一千零五十名教员。河北亦进行分期集训冬学教员，据新乐、河间等三十三个县统计，受训教员九千四百二十二人。东北多数省县均进行了冬学的试点工作，如辽东省教育厅去年十二月初，曾调十八名干部率领省师、省中师范班学生五百六十人，深入凤城、辽阳等县作冬学试点工作，以创造经验。河北省亦注意总结与推广以往开办冬学的经验。其次，各地干部、党员、团员积极带头入学，事先并经过各种形式的宣传动员，打破了群众怕上学的各种顾虑，认识到上冬学的好处，使大批男女群众，踊跃入学。学习情绪一般都很高。东北许多群众，自愿出钱、出油、出柴火，来解决冬学经费。河北因为冬学能结合生产，很多家长因怕耽误生产而阻止青年入学的，也变为督促自家的子弟去上学了。
    为了使冬学运动深入一步，河北省府教育厅于本月中旬派干部五人，分赴定县等地，加强对冬学的指导工作。有的县府教育科并组织视导团，深入各村进行冬学检查，解决各种问题。
