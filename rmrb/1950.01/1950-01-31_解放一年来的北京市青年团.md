    The Beijing Youth League Over the Past Year Since Liberation
    Youth League Beijing Municipal Committee Data Office

    Since the establishment of the New Democratic Youth League in Beijing in March of last year, the ranks of the League have gradually grown. By the end of 1949, the city had 22,430 League members. Because League members generally played an active leading role in learning, production, and work, the League has become a powerful assistant to the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Party.

    The Youth League in schools, relying on the exemplary actions of its members, assists the Party branch, cooperates with administrative leaders, unites teachers and students, and plays an active role in the construction of New Democratic education.

    The establishment of the Youth League in Beijing began among the student masses, which is inseparable from the fact that Beijing has been the center of student movements since the May Fourth Movement. The tradition of revolutionary struggle over the past 30 years has inspired the younger generation of Beijing. Under the leadership of the underground organization of the Communist Party, Beijing students inherited the glorious traditions of the "May Fourth," "December 9th," and "December 1st" movements. During the People's Liberation War, they persisted in the anti-American and anti-Chiang struggle. Therefore, immediately after liberation, more than 10,000 students participated in the takeover, support for the army, and other revolutionary work. More than 10,000 young people joined the South Work Corps, Revolutionary University, China University, and Military University, and embarked on revolutionary work posts. Tempered in underground struggle, they established secret organizations of revolutionary youth such as the "Minqing" and "Minlian" under the leadership of the Party. After the Preparatory Committee of the League was established last March, it began to build the League in schools based on underground organizations such as "Minqing" and "Minlian," and absorbed some progressive students.

    The first National Congress of the Youth League in April last year stipulated the League's principles and tasks. Since then, the work of building the League in Beijing has been carried out under clear guidelines.

    After the "May Fourth" Movement, League members in schools implemented the principles of the first Beijing Student Congress, clearly pointing out that the student movement should not be placed in opposition to learning, and that the tasks of the student movement under the new situation have fundamentally changed. It is necessary to strengthen learning and cultivate oneself to become a talent for the construction of the New Democratic country. At that time, there was a phenomenon of laxity and disorder in some schools. Thanks to the cooperation of Youth League members with administrative leaders and the unity of students, a democratic and conscious learning order was established in a relatively short period of time, which greatly strengthened the concept of learning. In the fair and reasonable evaluation of scholarships, League members and students received the most practical ideological training in being responsible to the people. The Youth League also assisted the Party branch in sending out outstanding backbones to serve as political teachers in middle schools, and mobilized League members to take the lead in learning political lessons well. League members also played a coordinating role in the administrative leaders' reform of certain old courses (such as the Peking University Law Department discontinuing certain reactionary and useless courses and adding new courses).

    During the summer vacation, the Beijing Preparatory Committee of the Youth League and the Beijing Student Union jointly organized the Youth Academy, the Summer Study Group for University and Middle School Students, and the Study Meeting for Youth League School Cadres to conduct political and ideological education based on historical materialism, supplemented by diverse recreational activities, and remedial courses in various major subjects. More than 13,000 university and middle school students flocked to this study, and under the guidance of the spirit of combining theory with practice and high ideological democracy, League members and the youth masses participating in the study gained important gains in establishing a labor perspective, a class perspective, and establishing a revolutionary outlook on life of serving the people. One thousand three hundred new League members joined the League during the summer vacation. This became a starting point for a large influx of young people into the League in schools after the summer vacation.

    Due to the rapid development of the revolutionary situation and the results of the ideological study of teachers and students held by the Party League and the Education Bureau during the summer vacation, the atmosphere of learning permeated the schools in the new semester after the summer vacation, and the enthusiasm of teachers and students for conscious learning was unprecedentedly high. New Democratic learning unfolded, and the vast number of League members demonstrated their exemplary behavior in uniting teachers and students and learning their regular courses well, and the level of courses generally improved. At the end of the semester, the League and the Student Union jointly issued a notice to launch planned review. In addition, League members played an active leading role in cooperating with administrative trusteeship of certain schools controlled by reactionary authorities (such as Zhongda Affiliated Middle School, Dazhong Middle School, etc.) and transforming extremely backward schools. League members of the Beining Midwifery School assisted the Education Bureau in transforming extremely backward administrative leadership. After this struggle, the number of League members increased from eight to sixty-nine, accounting for 29 percent of the total number of students in the school.

    Examples of Youth League members caring about the welfare of students also appeared. For example, League members of the Municipal No. 4 Boys' Middle School led more than 70 students to reclaim wasteland and grow vegetables in their spare time, and later organized cooperatives and grinded tofu to improve the nutrition of the students. League members of the Minguo Middle School united students with economic difficulties during the summer vacation, and everyone worked together to solve the food problem. League members in many schools such as the No. 2 Boys' Middle School and Peking University united the masses to compete for the canteen group, and improved the food by using precise division of labor and uniting cooks.

    In the three months after the summer vacation, the Youth League in universities and middle schools expanded from 6,000 to 12,000 people. Tsinghua and Peking University each had 1,000 and 800 League members, respectively, and there were more than 15 middle school branches with more than 200 League members. The average number of League members in schools throughout the city has exceeded 20% of the total number of students in the city.

    In increasing production, improving product quality, and completing production assault tasks, factory League members showed selfless and high enthusiasm.

    After liberation, the importance of the youth workers' movement has been greatly strengthened, because the task of restoring and developing production has become the primary task of Beijing, and young workers are an indispensable force. After the work of building the League in Beijing was carried out in factories, advanced young workers applied to join the League one after another. Now there are 3,513 League members among young workers. League members have been developed and work has been established in most of the public factories and private factories with more than 30 people. In the early days of the establishment of the League in factories, although there was a phenomenon that the concept of production was not clear enough and the emphasis was on service activities, after the leadership made it clear, League members showed high enthusiasm in increasing production and improving quality. In completing the assault tasks, there are many examples of League members uniting young workers and the vast number of workers to complete the tasks regardless of fatigue. At the "Evaluation of Progress" conference after the completion of the overhaul of No. 14 furnace at the Shijingshan Power Plant, all 29 League members who participated in the work won first, second, and third prizes. Wang Xiuying, a League member of the People's Printing Factory, was selected as a special model. League members of the private Jingwei Weaving Factory often made suggestions to the factory, which improved production and improved the lives of workers. League members of the Clothing Factory promoted the organization for technical research to every trade union group. At the same time, in technical learning, the relationship between teachers and apprentices was improved, and the 70th Ordnance Factory signed three teacher-apprentice contracts. Recently, in order to better complete the production tasks, strengthen the technical learning of young workers, and improve production efficiency, the League Working Committee has promoted the method of formulating individual production plans in major factories. Zhang Yinchun, a League member of the Shijingshan Power Plant, carefully calculated and allocated working hours, increasing the output of chain shafts from seven or eight per day to fifteen. Liu Zhongkui and Zheng Wenhua cooperated, increasing the daily output to more than 60. League members of the intaglio and offset printing sections of the People's Printing Factory also led the machine operators to formulate machine production plans.

    The League also played an organizing and promoting role in cultural and recreational activities in factories. The Factory Literary and Art Work Committee, jointly organized by the Literary and Art Department of the Municipal League Working Committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Municipal Cultural Committee, helped factories organize clubs, singing teams, waist drum teams, etc., and helped workers write scripts and publish tabloids. The role of factory League members in factory security work is also very significant. Many factory security team League members have become the main backbone.

    The Rural League was established during the land reform and became an active force in the struggle against local bullies. League members of organs are important assistants to the administration and the Party in guaranteeing administrative work.

    The development of the Rural League was established in conjunction with the land reform movement. When the first batch of land reform was completed, 2,100 League members had been developed in 72 villages. They were an active leading force in the struggle against local bullies. At present, the work in the suburbs must not only strengthen the leadership of the established League, but also continue to build the League in conjunction with the second and third batches of land reform, and study how to welcome the great agricultural production this spring.

    League members of organs are important assistants to the administration and the Party in guaranteeing administrative work, strengthening business learning, and enlivening the life of organs. League members of the Public Security Bureau have shown good performance in resolutely completing tasks regardless of day and night and rain and snow.

    In carrying out social service work, the Municipal League Working Committee has held several city-wide voluntary labor activities, with more than 36,000 League members and the masses participating. This is the construction of Tiananmen Square, the opening of the Taimiao Lawn, the opening of Jianguomen in the east city, and the leveling of the tree-lined roadbed from September to November last year. Due to the limitations of the scale of the project and the number of tools, many League members and young people felt that they had lost the best opportunity to exercise because they could not participate. These voluntary labor activities saved the government about 50,000 catties of millet and cultivated the collective labor concept of young people in practical labor. Secondly, the Municipal League Working Committee and the Social Service Department of the Central Committee of the League jointly established the Youth Service Department, opened reading rooms and various cultural and recreational sports activities, and established Russian and bookkeeping remedial night schools. In addition, League members and enthusiastic teachers and students from various schools held various social education activities. According to a rough estimate, there are more than 70 units of literacy classes, night schools, etc. for children, adults, or women held by various schools throughout the city.

    Youth League members throughout the city actively engage in social service work. The organization of the Young Pioneers is developing rapidly.

    In terms of Young Pioneers work, trial construction of the Children's Corps began after liberation. Within two months after the Central Committee of the League announced the decision to establish the Chinese Young Pioneers, the original members of the Children's Corps were transferred to team members, and the organization of the team was rapidly developed. At present, there are more than 16,000 team members in more than 90 units in junior high schools and elementary schools. Progressive elementary school teachers and League members who are enthusiastic about service are the main leading force of the Young Pioneers. In the future, the team will continue to be built in a focused and step-by-step manner, and the activities and education of the team members will be studied.

    The achievements of the capital's Youth League in growing and working over the past year are mainly due to the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the League and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the strong help and cooperation of the government and various organs and groups, and the improvement of the awareness of the vast number of young people. There are still many shortcomings in the work of the Beijing Youth League, and the most pressing problem to be solved at present is how to better give play to the active role of the League and widely unite the young masses. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen the work of the branch, improve the life of the branch, and give play to the role of the branch, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological education of League members in Marxism-Leninism, improve the level of cadres, and it is necessary to greatly strengthen and expand the connections with young people from all walks of life. Only in this way can we further assist in doing a good job in school education, better serve production and construction, and move forward in the struggle to unite and educate the younger generation.

    解放一年来的北京市青年团
    青年团北京市工委资料室
    北京市自去年三月开始建立新民主主义青年团以来，团的队伍日渐发展壮大，到一九四九年底，全市团员已有两万二千四百三十人。由于团员一般的在学习、生产、工作上发挥了积极带头的作用，团已成为北京市人民政府和党的有力助手了。
          ×              ×              ×
    学校青年团依靠团员的模范行动，协助党支部，配合行政领导，团结师生，在新民主主义教育建设中起了积极作用。
    北京市的青年团的建立，首先从学生群众中开始，这是和北京从“五四”以来即是学生运动的中心的这一事实分不开的。三十年来的革命斗争的传统，鼓舞了北京年青的后一代。在共产党地下组织领导下，北京学生承继了“五四”“一二九”“一二一”的光荣传统，在人民解放战争时期，坚持了反美反蒋的斗争。因此在刚一解放时，即有一万多学生参加接管、劳军等革命工作。并有一万以上的青年参加南工团、革大、华大、军大，走上革命工作岗位。在地下斗争的锻炼中，他们在党的领导下，建立了“民青”“民联”等革命青年的秘密组织。去年三月，团的筹委会成立后，在学校中即以“民青”“民联”等地下组织为基础，并吸收了一部分进步学生开始建团。
    去年四月青年团第一次全国代表大会，规定了青年团的方针任务，北京市建团工作自此便在明确方针下展开工作了。
    “五四”以后，学校团员贯彻北京市第一届学生代表大会的方针，明确指出：不能把学生运动与学习对立起来，新形势下学生运动的任务从根本上改变了。必须加强学习，培养自己成为新民主主义国家的建设人才。当时在一部分学校中存在着散漫无秩序的现象，由于青年团员配合行政领导，团结同学，在较短的时期内，建立了民主自觉的学习秩序，大大加强了学习观念。在公平合理评议助学金当中，团员和同学在一起受到最实际的向人民负责的思想锻炼。青年团又协助党支部输送出优秀的骨干去作中学政治课的教员，发动团员带头学好政治课。在行政领导进行的某些旧课程的改革中（如北大法律系停开了某些反动及无用课程，并增设新课），团员亦起了配合的作用。
    暑假中，青年团北京市筹委会和北京市学联合办了青年学园、大中学生暑期学习团及青年团学校干部学习会，进行以唯物史观为主的政治思想教育，配合以多种多样的康乐活动，补习各种主要课程。一万三千多大中同学涌进了这一学习，在理论与实际结合和高度思想民主的精神指导下，参加学习的团员和青年群众在确立劳动观点、阶级观点、建立为人民服务的革命人生观方面得到重要的收获。一千三百名新团员在暑期中加入了团。这成为暑期以后学校青年大量涌到团内的一个起点。
    由于革命形势的迅速发展和暑期党团和教育局教联举办师生思想学习的结果，在暑假以后的新的学期中，学校内被学习空气所弥漫了，师生的自觉学习热情是从未曾见的高涨。新民主主义学习展开了，广大团员在团结师生，学好正课中表现了自己的模范行为，课程水平一般的提高了。而在学期末，团与学联共同发出通知，展开了有计划的温课。此外，在配合行政代管某些反动当局把持的学校（如中大附中、大中中学等校）及改造极端落后的学校上，团员起了积极带头的作用。北宁助产学校团员曾协助教育局改造了极端落后的行政领导，在这一斗争以后，团员由八人发展到六十九人，占全校学生总数百分之二十九。
    青年团员关心同学福利的实例也出现了，如市立男四中团员带动七十多个同学利用课余开荒种菜，后来又组织了合作社、磨豆腐，改善了同学的营养。民国中学团员在暑期中团结了经济困难的同学，大家动手劳动，解决伙食问题。男二中和北大等许多学校中的团员，团结群众竞选办膳团，运用精密分工、团结厨工等方法，改善了伙食。
    大、中学校青年团在暑假后的三个月里，由六千人扩大到一万二千人。清华、北大各有一千和八百团员，有十五个以上的中学支部，团员达二百人以上。全市学生团员数平均已超过全市学生百分之二十以上。
    在增加产量，提高产品质量，完成生产突击任务中，工厂团员表现了忘我的高度热情。
    解放后，青年工人运动的重要性大大加强了，因为恢复与发展生产的任务成为北京市的首要任务，而青年工人是不可忽视的力量。北京建团工作在工厂展开以后，先进的青工纷纷申请入团，现在青工团员已有三千五百十三人，在极大部分的公营工厂和具有三十人以上的私营工厂中，都发展了团员，建立了工作。在工厂团初建立的时候，虽有生产观念不够明确，偏重服务活动的现象，在领导上明确指出以后，团员在增加产量、提高质量中，表现了高度的热情。在完成突击任务中，团员团结青工，和广大工人一道，不顾疲劳完成任务的事例是极多的。石景山发电厂在大修十四号炉完工后的“评进步”大会上，参加工作的二十九个团员都获得了头、二、三等奖。人民印刷厂团员王秀莹被选为特等模范。私营经纬织布厂的团员，经常向厂方提意见，使生产得到提高，工人生活也得到改善。被服厂的团员把研究技术的组织推广到每一工会小组里去。同时，在技术学习中，改善了师徒关系，七十兵工厂并订立了三个师徒合同。最近，为了更好地完成生产任务，加强青工的技术学习，提高生产效率，团工委在各主要工厂推行了订立个人生产计划的方法。石景山发电厂团员张荫春仔细地计算和分配了工作时间，使链子轴的产量由每天七、八根，提高到十五根。刘钟骙和郑文华两人分工合作，每天生产量提到六十根以上。人民印刷厂凹印、胶印股团员并带动领机订立了机器生产计划。
    团在工厂的文娱活动中也起了组织与推动作用，由团市工委文艺部及市总工会、市文委等联合组成的工厂文艺工作委员会帮助各厂组织了俱乐部、歌咏队、腰鼓队等，帮助工人自编剧本和出版小报等。工厂团员在工厂保卫工作中的作用也是很显著的，许多工厂保卫队团员成为主要的骨干。
    农村团是在土地改革中建立起来的，在斗争恶霸中成为积极力量。机关团员在保证行政工作等方面，是行政与党的重要助手。
    农村团的发展，是结合土地改革运动建立起来的，第一批土改完成时已在七十二个村中发展了二千一百名团员，他们在斗争恶霸当中是积极带头的力量，目前郊区工作不仅要加强已建立的团的领导，还要继续结合第二、三批土改继续建团，并研究今春如何迎接农业大生产。
    机关团员在保证行政工作、加强学习业务、活跃机关生活上，是行政与党重要的助手，公安局的团员在不分昼夜和雨雪，坚决完成任务上有了良好的表现。
    在开展社会服务工作方面，团市工委举办了几次全市性的义务劳动，参加的团员和群众达到三万六千人以上。这就是去年九月至十一月的修筑天安门广场、开辟太庙草地、打通东城建国门、平筑林荫大道路基。由于工程规模和工具数量的限制，许多团员和青年因不能参加而感到失去最好的锻炼机会，这些义务劳动共为政府节省了约五万斤小米，并在实际劳动中培养了青年们集体的劳动观念。其次，团市工委与团中央社会服务部共同设立了青年服务部、开辟阅览室及各种文娱体育活动，成立了俄文、簿记补习夜校等。此外，各学校的团员和热心服务的师生举办了各种社会教育工作。据粗略统计，全市各校举办的儿童、成人或妇女的识字班、夜校等共有七十余单位。
    全市青年团员积极从事社会服务工作。少年儿童队的组织迅速发展起来。
    少年儿童工作方面，在解放后即开始试建儿童团。在团中央关于建立中国少年儿童队的决定公布以后的两个月内，原来的儿童团员都转为队员，队的组织有了迅速的开展。目前在初中及小学九十余个单位中，队员已达一万六千人。热心服务的进步小学教师和团员是少年儿童队的主要领导力量。今后将继续有重点有步骤地建队。并研究队员的活动及教育问题。
              ×              ×              ×
    首都青年团在壮大中，一年来的工作成绩的获得，主要是由于团中央和中共北京市委的正确领导，政府和各机关、团体的有力帮助与配合，以及广大青年觉悟的提高。北京市青年团的工作中还存在着许多缺点，而目前主要亟待解决的问题，就是如何更好地发挥团的积极作用与广泛团结青年群众。为此，就必须加强支部工作，健全支部生活，发挥支部的作用，必须加强团员马列主义思想教育，提高干部水平，而且必须大大加强与扩大各界青年的联系。这样才能进一步协助作好学校教育工作、更好地为生产建设服务，在为团结教育青年一代的斗争中，前进一步。
