Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: TASS, Moscow dispatch: Lasadin, in a commentary on international affairs in *Pravda*, commenting on the results of the recent North Atlantic Alliance Council meeting, stated: France has been ordered to establish thirty divisions, which, according to American strategists, are designated to serve as "shock troops" in the planned war of aggression. However, no country in Europe threatens the French people or France. If there is indeed any danger to France's security, it lies in the plan to rearm West Germany and transform it into an aggressive military state. This plan is being formulated under the same North Atlantic Treaty. Therefore, no one can believe the hypocritical declarations of the American bosses of the North Atlantic Group and the echoes from France, who say that France's rearmament is due to the need for defense. However, according to the military budget, France now spends 200 billion francs annually to engage in further arms races and the militarization of the country.

Lasadin further pointed out the excessive inflation of military budgets of other countries within the North Atlantic Group, stating: Britain's military expenditure has increased to 1.2 billion pounds this year, compared to 800 million pounds last year. Canada's military budget this year reaches 586 million dollars, which is unprecedented in the country's history.

The author concluded by pointing out: The warmongers are preparing new military gambles, hoping to find a way out and resolve the intractable contradictions that divide the capitalist world. However, hundreds of millions of people are defending peace, vigilantly watching the warmongers' conspiracies, and strengthening their struggle to win peace against the evil plans of the seekers of world hegemony.

    侵略集团加紧备战
    法将建立三十个师
    世界人民正密切注意
    【新华社北京十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：拉萨丁顷在真理报的国际述评中论及最近北大西洋联盟理事会会议的结果称：法国受命成立三十个师，据美国战略家称，这些军队指定在准备中的侵略战争中担任“突击队”。但是，在欧洲，没有一个国家威胁着法国人民和法国。如果说法国的安全的确有任何危险的话，这个危险就隐藏在重行武装西德、并把它变为一个侵略性的军事国家的计划之内。而这个计划却就是根据同一的北大西洋公约而在拟订中。因此，没有人可以相信北大西洋集团的美国老板的虚伪声明和法国的应和，他们说：法国的重整军备系由于防御的需要。但是，按照军事预算，法国现在每年要开支二千亿法郎，以进行更进一步的军备竞赛和全国的军事化。
    拉萨丁进一步指出北大西洋集团内其他各国军事预算的过度膨胀称：英国的军事开支，本年增加至十二亿英镑，去年则为八亿英镑。加拿大今年的军事预算达五亿八千六百万美元，这在该国历史上是空前庞大的。
    作者最后指出：战争贩子们正在准备新的军事赌博，希望借此寻得生路和解脱分裂着资本主义世界的不可解脱的矛盾。但是，千百万人民正在保卫着和平，他们警觉地密切注意战争贩子的阴谋，并且加强斗争，以争取和平，反对世界霸权追求者的罪恶计划。
