    Welcoming the 1950 Production and Construction Tasks
    Following Chairman Mao's Instructions, All Units Actively Prepare
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing] The field armies and military region units of the People's Liberation Army that currently do not have combat missions are actively preparing for production and construction work, following the "Instructions on the Participation of the Army in Production and Construction in 1950" issued by Chairman Mao.
    The production and construction work of the First Field Army is led by Deputy Commander Zhang Zongxun, who decided to focus on agricultural production, engage in animal husbandry, develop water conservancy, and participate in industrial and mining construction. Gan Siqi, Director of the Political Department, called on all officers and soldiers to settle down and take root in order to build the Great Northwest. Quan Bingzhi, Deputy Battalion Commander of a certain battalion, was a labor hero in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region's Great Production Movement during the Anti-Japanese War. He said, "In the past, engaging in production was to solve temporary difficulties. Now, engaging in production requires long-term planning to restore and develop the national economy!"
    On the 14th, responsible cadres from Lanzhou's agencies and military units invited engineers to a symposium to discuss how to integrate the troops' production and construction with Lanzhou's construction work. As a result, a preliminary production plan for Lanzhou's agencies and troops was drafted, targeting the shortage of power and fuel in Lanzhou. The main projects include building a new power plant and a light railway for transporting coal from Lanzhou to Agan Town, as well as establishing a woolen mill and a farm implement factory. All units are engaged in growing vegetables, raising pigs, and grinding tofu to solve their own living problems. At the meeting, a Production Committee of the Party, government, and military in Lanzhou, headed by Gan Siqi, was elected to lead the production work of all units and agencies in the city.
    The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Military Region has established a Production Committee, with Military Region Commander Wu Daifeng and Political Department Director Hui Shigong as the Director and Deputy Director, respectively. It has been decided that at all levels, from the Military Region down to the company level, Production Committees will be formed democratically by electing three to five people. The production and construction plan for next year includes vigorously participating in agricultural production, developing sideline production, establishing production cooperatives, and extensively encouraging cadres and soldiers to invest in shares. The units directly under the Military Region will establish a large farm in Nanniwan, Yan'an (where General Wang Zhen led the 359th Brigade in land reclamation and production during the Great Production Movement in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, achieving great success). Other units under the Military Region will plant vegetables, hemp seeds, and sugar beets in nearby open spaces, and raise livestock. Female comrades in the directly subordinate agencies will engage in handicrafts during their spare time. The Guanzhong Weinan Military Sub-district has determined a production policy focusing on agriculture, handicrafts, and transportation. Next spring, it plans to organize a group of people to reclaim wasteland in the southern mountains. The Political Department of a certain army stationed in Xi'an issued instructions on the 15th of this month, calling on the entire army to accumulate fertilizer and cooperate with local authorities in surveying wasteland. Deputy military cadres of each unit will be responsible for inspecting and guiding the fertilizer accumulation work.
    The troops stationed in Dihua, including the uprising troops, are carrying out frugality measures and accumulating grain needed for production next year. The Chief of Staff of a certain corps called on all officers and soldiers in the corps to consider the poverty of the people in Xinjiang, to save grain during the winter, and to save it for eating during production next year, in order to reduce the burden on the people.
    The Third Field Army units guarding Shanghai have been participating in amateur production since August this year, reclaiming more than 2,000 mu of wasteland inside and outside the city, and raising more than 1,500 pigs. Under the leadership of the Production Committee, various units have overcome many difficulties in production. For example, due to the lack of land in the city, the soldiers reclaimed wasteland on Fuxing Island, which was overgrown with weeds, and cleared rubble in Rihui Port, which had been destroyed by the war, to create vegetable gardens. Due to the lack of agricultural tools during cultivation, the soldiers used the shovels used for digging fortifications to cultivate the land. Now, the troops guarding Shanghai are formulating next year's production plan in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, accumulating a large amount of fertilizer, and preparing to reclaim wasteland outside the city, and sow a large amount of grain and sesame.
    The Changsha Garrison troops have established Production Committees at the division, regiment, and company levels, and have decided to focus on agriculture, raising pigs, and raising fish. They have also established agricultural production brigades, transportation brigades, and firewood-cutting brigades. All units are formulating unit and individual production plans.
    The Jiangxi Military Region Production and Construction Committee was established on the 12th. It stipulates that next year, in addition to carrying out the tasks of suppressing bandits, training soldiers, and consolidation, each person will participate in production for an average of 60 days. Each soldier will produce 300 jin of rice, and each agency staff member will produce 150 jin; the goal is to be self-sufficient in vegetables for half a year, and production plans are being drafted for burning charcoal, mining white clay (raw material for porcelain), and mining tungsten. The Fuzhou Military Sub-district Production Committee has decided that each person will cultivate two mu of land next year.
    The North China Military Region Production Committee was established a few days ago and recently held an enlarged meeting of the Production Committee to formulate specific production plans. (Attached photo)

    迎接一九五零年生产建设任务
    依照毛主席指示各部队积极准备
    【新华社北京电】人民解放军中现时没有作战任务的野战部队和各级军区部队，正纷纷依照毛主席颁发的《关于一九五○年军队参加生产建设的指示》，积极进行生产建设的准备工作。
    第一野战军的生产建设工作由副司令员张宗逊领导，决定以农业生产为主，并从事畜牧事业，发展水利，参加工矿建设。政治部主任甘泗淇号召全军指战员安下心、扎下根，建设大西北。某营副营长权秉智是抗日战争时代陕北大生产运动中的劳动英雄，他说：“过去搞生产是解决一时的困难，现在搞生产要作长期打算，恢复和发展国家经济！”
    兰州机关、部队负责干部十四日邀集工程师座谈，商讨如何使部队生产建设和兰州市的建设工作相结合。结果决定针对兰州动力和燃料不足的特点，初步拟订了兰州市机关部队生产计划，主要项目为兴建新电厂和修建兰州至阿干镇运煤轻便铁道，开办毛织厂及农具工厂。各单位进行种菜、喂猪、磨豆腐，解决各该单位的生活问题。会上选举了以甘泗淇为首的兰州市党、政、军生产委员会，领导全市部队机关生产工作。
    陕北军区已成立生产委员会，由军区司令员吴岱峰及政治部主任惠世恭任正副主任，决定自军区以下直至连级均以民主方式推选三人至五人组成生产委员会。明年生产建设计划，决定除大力参加农业生产外，并发展副业生产，建立生产合作社，大量吸收干部、战士入股。军区直属部队在延安南泥湾（陕北大生产运动时，王震将军率领的三五九旅在此开荒生产，获极大的成绩）开设较大农场，军区所属其他单位在附近空地种植蔬菜、麻子、糖萝卜，并饲养家畜。直属各机关女同志利用工余时间作手工业生产。关中湄南军分区确定以农业、手工业、运输业为主的生产方针，明春准备组织一部分人到南山开荒。驻西安某军政治部已于本月十五日发出指示，号召全军进行积肥，协同地方勘察荒地，由各单位军事干部副职人员，负责检查指导积肥工作。
    迪化驻军包括起义部队在内，展开节约，积蓄明年生产时所需的口粮。某兵团参谋长号召全兵团指战员，照顾新疆老百姓的贫困，大家冬天节省粮食，留到明年生产的时候吃，以减轻人民负担。
    警备淞沪的第三野战军各部，从今年八月起就开始参加业余生产，在市内外开垦荒地二千余亩，喂猪一千五百余只。各部在生产委员会领导下，克服了许多生产中的困难，如城市缺乏土地，战士们便在蒿草丛生的复兴岛上开垦荒地，在为战争所破坏的日晖港清除瓦砾，辟为菜园；耕作时缺乏农具，战士们便用挖工事的铁锹锄地。现在警备淞沪的部队，正根据毛主席的指示订出明年的生产计划，大量积肥，准备开垦市外荒地，大量播种粮食和芝麻。
    长沙警备部队成立师、团、连各级生产委员会，决定以农业为主，养猪、养鱼，并成立农业生产大队、运输大队、砍柴大队。各单位正纷纷制订单位及个人生产计划。
    江西军区生产建设委员会已于十二日成立，规定明年除执行剿匪、练兵、整训任务以外，每人平均以六十天参加生产。部队每人生产稻谷三百斤，机关人员生产一百五十斤；做到自给半年蔬菜，并拟订烧木炭、挖白泥（瓷器原料）、开钨矿等生产工作计划。抚州军分区生产委员会，决定明年每人要种地二亩。
    华北军区生产委员会已于日前成立，最近召开了生产委员扩大会，拟订了具体的生产计划。（附图片）
