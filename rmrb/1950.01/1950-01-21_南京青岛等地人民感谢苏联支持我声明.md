Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 20th: People and opinion leaders in Nanjing, Qingdao, and other places have expressed their gratitude for the Soviet Union's support in the United Nations for our proposal to expel the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group. Yang Xianyi, one of the heads of the Nanjing Office of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: The Chinese people have their own Central People's Government and will never allow representatives of the Kuomintang bandits and pirates to act as pawns of American imperialism in the United Nations agencies under a "legal" identity. We support Foreign Minister Zhou’s solemn statement and deeply appreciate the Soviet representative's support for our just action. Chen Minzhi, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League in Nanjing, and Zhang Shiming, a member of the Nanjing branch of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, have expressed the same opinions. The Nanjing Small and Medium-Sized Social Education Staff Union, the Preparatory Committee of the Farmers Association, the Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Democratic Youth Federation, the Student Federation, and workers from various factories have all issued statements or telegrams, unanimously expressing their determination to fight to expel the "representatives" of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group from the United Nations agencies.

The Standing Committee of the People's Congress of Qingdao City, representing 800,000 people in the city, thanked the Soviet representative for their strong support of the will of the Chinese people. The Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Democratic Women's Federation jointly issued a statement, thanking the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries for their support for our country, and expressing extreme indignation at the American imperialists' conspiracy to oppose the Chinese people. The Qingdao Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce have expressed the same opinions.

The Shenyang Northeast Daily, the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, and the Hankou Dagang Daily have all published editorials, unanimously expressing their gratitude for the Soviet Union's righteous act in the United Nations. The Northeast Daily editorial stated: The Soviet Union solemnly declared that it would not participate in the work of the Security Council until the Kuomintang bandit gang representatives were expelled from the Security Council. This statement represents the solemn stance of the world's democratic people, headed by the Soviet Union, and their great friendship towards the people of our country.

    南京青岛等地人民感谢苏联支持我声明
    【新华社北京二十日电】南京、青岛等地人民和舆论界，纷纷对苏联在联合国中支持我开除国民党反动残余集团代表的建议的行动表示感谢。中国国民党革命委员会南京办事处负责人之一杨宪益发表谈话说：中国人民有了自己的中央人民政府，决不容许国民党流寇海盗的代表以“合法”身份，在联合国机构中充当美帝国主义的走卒。我们拥护周外长的严正声明，并深切感谢苏联代表支持我国的正义行动。现在南京的民盟中委陈敏之及农工民主党南京支部委员章师明都发表了相同的意见。南京中小社教职员联合会、农民协会筹委会、青年团工作委员会、民主青年联合会、学生联合会及各工厂工人等都纷纷发表谈话或通电，一致表示要为驱逐国民党反动残余集团的“代表”出联合国机构而奋斗。
    青岛市各界人民代表会常委会，代表全市八十万人民感谢苏联代表对于中国人民意志的有力支持。市总工会筹委会和民主妇女联合会联合发表声明，感谢苏联和各人民民主国家对于我国的支持，并对美帝国主义反对中国人民的阴谋表示异常愤恨。青岛中苏友好协会、工商业联合会都发表了同样的意见。
    沈阳东北日报、上海大公报、汉口大刚报都先后发表社论，对苏联在联合国的义举一致表示感谢。东北日报社论说：苏联严正声明在安理会驱逐国民党匪帮代表之前，将不参加安理会的工作。这一声明代表着以苏联为首的世界民主人民的严正立场与对我国人民的伟大的友情。
