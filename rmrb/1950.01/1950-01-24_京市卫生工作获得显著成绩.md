Beijing's health work achieved significant results in 1949.

In terms of environmental sanitation, the municipal government led two garbage removal campaigns, removing a total of more than 230,000 tons of garbage accumulated during the period of Japanese occupation and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. In the past, an average of more than 10,000 tons of garbage accumulated each year. Last year, it was less than 2,000 tons. Twenty new and renovated public toilets and ninety sewage pools were built and repaired.

The Health Bureau constantly inspected, improved, and disinfected well water and tap water, and strengthened the management of clean food products. In May of the year before last, deaths caused by gastrointestinal diseases accounted for 14 percent of the total deaths in the city, while in May of last year, it had decreased to just over 9 percent.

In terms of epidemic prevention, expanded vaccination campaigns in the spring and typhoid and diphtheria vaccinations, cholera vaccinations in the summer, and an encephalitis prevention campaign were carried out in the past year. Eleven epidemic prevention and health stations were established in the suburbs.

In late October, due to the discovery of plague in Chahar Province, the municipal government effectively vaccinated 41 percent of the citizens and established health teams based on ten households.

In terms of medicine, in addition to helping establish four workers' clinics and four farmers' medical cooperatives, the Municipal Hospital also provided reduced and free medical care. In the past year, more than 100,000 people enjoyed reduced or free treatment, accounting for one-third of the total number of treatments.

    京市卫生工作获得显著成绩
    【北京讯】北京市的卫生工作在一九四九年曾经获得显著成绩。
    在环境卫生方面，市政府领导过两次清除垃圾的运动，一共运除了日寇统治时期和国民党反动统治时期所积存下的垃圾二十三万余吨。过去每年平均积存垃圾约万余吨。而去年不到两千吨。新建和修整了二十座公厕和九十座秽水池。
    卫生局不断地进行了井水和自来水的检验、改善和消毒并且加强了清洁饮食物品的管理，前年五月全市死亡人口里因肠胃病致死的占百分之十四，而去年五月已经减少到百分之九强。
    在防疫工作方面，过去一年间曾经进行过春季扩大种痘和伤寒、白喉预防注射，夏季霍乱预防注射以及防治大脑炎运动。在郊区建立了十一个防疫卫生站。
    十月下旬，由于察北发现鼠疫，市政府使百分之四十一的市民得到了有效的预防注射，而且建立了以十户为单位的卫生小组。
    在医药方面，市卫生局除了帮助建立四处工人诊疗所和四处农民医药合作社外，并由市立医院进行了减费和免费医疗。一年来享受减费免费待遇的在十万人以上，占治疗总人数的三分之一。
