    This Year's Transportation Work Plan
    In terms of shipping: The first half of the year will focus on organizing the Beiyang shipping route, the Yangtze River shipping route, and other inland river shipping routes. We will also prepare for the restoration of national shipping and the opening of international routes after the liberation of Taiwan.
    In terms of highways: The repair tasks on the following lines must be completed quickly: 1. Xi'an to Tacheng; 2. Lanzhou to Chengdu; 3. Chengdu to Kunming, Wanting; 4. Wuchang to Hengyang, Qujing; 5. Wuchang to Xiamen; 6. Beijing to Tianjin.
    Regarding the work plan for 1950, the summary stipulates: In shipping, the first half of 1950 will mainly focus on organizing the Beiyang route, the Yangtze River route, and other inland river routes, and preparing for the restoration of national navigation and the opening of foreign routes after the liberation of Taiwan. Therefore, dredging harbors and inland river channels, restoring and renovating lighthouse markers, strengthening the management of wharves and warehouses, salvaging sunken ships, repairing old ships, and improving shipyard management systems will be the main tasks for 1950. In 1950, we will build the Pukou wharf, continue the construction of the Tanggu New Port project, and complete the central government's established ship building plan. In terms of highways, in 1950, in addition to building several new outer lines for war needs, we must first focus on restoring national trunk lines and provincial roads of significant economic importance, while generally repairing roads to maintain traffic. The repair tasks on the following lines must be completed quickly in 1950: (1) Xi'an to Lanzhou to Tacheng; (2) Lanzhou to Huajialing to Shuangshipu to Chengdu; (3) Chengdu to Luzhou to Qujing to Kunming to Wanting; (4) Wuchang to Hengyang to Guiyang to Qujing; (5) Wuchang to Nanchang to Minhou to Xiamen; (6) Beijing to Tianjin to Tanggu, totaling 10,121 kilometers. The provincial roads should be planned by the provinces and submitted to the Central Highway Administration for unified research and decision. In addition, we should unify automobile management, establish a people's labor construction system, and mobilize the masses to carry out highway repair and maintenance work.
    According to statistics, the main shipping routes that have been liberated and can be navigated by ships reach more than 12,000 kilometers, accounting for 85 percent of the country's shipping routes. The inland river routes navigable by sailboats are approximately 60,000 kilometers, and they are all open to navigation. The total length of existing highways in the liberated areas (excluding the southwest and south China) is 200,3419 kilometers. After liberation, 26,284 kilometers were repaired, and 59,918 kilometers are currently passable. There are seven public shipbuilding and repair factories and thirty-one automobile repair and assembly plants, all of which have resumed work. Highway and shipping workers in various regions have achieved considerable successes and accumulated experience in their work. After this meeting, national shipping and highway transportation work will begin to be unified under the leadership of the Central People's Government, and greater achievements will be made.

    今年交通工作计划
    航务方面：上半年主要是组织北洋航线、长江航线及其他各内河航线，并准备台湾解放后，恢复全国航运，开辟国外航线。
    公路方面：须迅速完成下列各线修补任务：一、西安至塔城；二、兰州至成都；三、成都至昆明、畹町；四、武昌至衡阳、曲靖；五、武昌至厦门；六、北京至天津。
    关于一九五○年工作计划，总结规定：在航务方面，一九五○年上半年主要是组织北洋航线、长江航线及其他各内河航线，并准备台湾解放后，恢复全国通航，开辟国外航线。因而疏浚港湾内河航道，恢复整理灯塔标志，加强管理码头仓库，打捞沉没船只，修理旧船，改善船厂管理制度，即为一九五○年之主要工作。一九五○年要修建浦口码头，继续进行塘沽新港工程，并完成中央已定的建造舶船计划。在公路方面，一九五○年除为战争需要增建若干新外线，首先要重点恢复国道干线及具有重要经济意义之省道，一般公路则加以修补维持通车。一九五○年必须迅速完成下列各线补修任务：（一）西安至兰州至塔城；（二）兰州至华家岭至双石铺至成都；（三）成都至泸州至曲靖至昆明至畹町；（四）武昌至衡阳至贵阳至曲靖；（五）武昌至南昌至闽侯至厦门；（六）北京至天津至塘沽，共一○一二一公里。省道由各省区拟出计划呈交中央公路总局统一研究决定。此外，应统一汽车管理建立民工建勤制度，发动群众进行公路修复与护养工作。
    按全国已解放能通轮船之主要航线达一万二千余公里，占全国航线百分之八十五，全国可通帆船的内河航线约六万余公里，均已通航；全国已解放地区（西南、华南未计入）现有公路二十万零三千四百一十九公里，解放后抢修了二万六千二百八十四公里，目前能通车者五万九千九百一十八公里；现有公营修造船厂七处与汽车修配厂三十一处，均已复工。各地公路、航务工作人员在工作中且已获得不少成绩与经验。经过此次会议，全国航务公路运输工作开始统一于中央人民政府领导下，将获得更大的成绩。
