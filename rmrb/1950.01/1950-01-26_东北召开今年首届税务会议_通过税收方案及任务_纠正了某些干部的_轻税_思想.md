Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 25th: The first tax conference of the year in the Northeast concluded on the 13th of this month after lasting eight days. The main content of the meeting was to formulate and approve the 1950 tax plan based on the spirit of the National Tax Conference and the specific circumstances of economic recovery and development in the Northeast, and to determine the specific tasks for the first quarter. The meeting corrected the "light tax" ideology of some cadres and the erroneous view that tasks and policies were contradictory. At this meeting, various regions introduced cases and experiences of breaking through false accounts. For example, after Xi'an City in Liaodong Province exposed the phenomenon of some merchants concealing profits through methods such as two sets of capital, two sets of accounts, breaking up large sums into smaller ones, fake accounts, forging expenses, and not recording goods coming in and out, taxes were levied according to the actual situation, which everyone said was fair and reasonable. An Dong City also found that more than a dozen large stores specially hired a "expert" in creating false accounts in an attempt to evade taxes.

            Urban tax burden is not heavy, urban and rural burdens should be balanced.
The meeting also discussed the comparison of urban and rural burdens. It was unanimously agreed that urban taxes are not heavier than in the past, and urban and rural burdens must be gradually balanced and reasonable in the future.

At the end of the meeting, the following resolutions were made on the basic methods and systems for future collection work: (1) Grasp and investigate urban tax sources, understand the situation of various industries, and cooperate with industrial and commercial departments to conduct a comprehensive registration and investigation. (2) Gradually establish a formal collection system, combine breaking through false accounts with establishing new accounts, strengthen business management, implement a shipping invoice system, and implement a management responsibility system based on industry and region to regularly understand the situation of industry and commerce. (3) Strengthen field work and strictly suppress smuggling. (4) The deployment of the tax network should generally not distribute forces evenly according to administrative divisions, but should dispatch cadres according to the situation of tax sources, with different priorities.

    东北召开今年首届税务会议
    通过税收方案及任务
    纠正了某些干部的“轻税”思想
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】东北今年首届税务会议历时八日，于本月十三日结束。会议主要内容是根据全国税务会议精神，结合东北经济恢复与发展的具体情况，制定与通过了一九五○年税收计划方案，并确定第一季度的具体任务。会议中纠正了某些干部轻税思想及认为任务与政策矛盾的错误观点。这次会议上各地都介绍一些突破假账的情况和经验。如辽东省西安市揭发了某些商人以两套资本、两套账、化整为零、假户头、伪造开支、进出货不记账等方式隐瞒利润的现象后，按实情征税，大家都说公平合理。安东市也查出十几家大商店专雇用一个造假账“专家”，企图偷税。
            城市税收并不重，城乡负担要平衡。
    会议也讨论了城乡负担的比较。一致认为城市税收并不较过去重，今后必须逐渐做到城乡负担平衡合理。
    会议最后对今后征收工作的基本方法与制度，做出如下决议：（一）掌握与调查城市税源，了解工商业各行业的情况，并配合工商部门进行一次全面的登记调查。（二）逐渐建立正规征收制度，把突破假账与建立新账结合起来，加强营业管理，实行发货票制，并按行业结合地区实行管理的专责制，经常了解工商业情况。（三）加强外勤，严密缉私。（四）税网布置一般不按行政区划平均分配力量，应根据税源情况，分别轻重调派干部。
