Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 13th: Dutch imperialism will directly command the Indonesian puppet. According to the Dutch Aneta News Agency on the 10th, the "United States of Indonesia" cabinet had a sharp dispute over the recent appointment of the chief of staff. The dispute arose because the Dutch authorities believed that the Minister of Defense, Bouwono, in the Hatta cabinet, had not appointed personnel from the "Dutch Indonesian Army" of the Dutch colonial armed forces to participate in the high command of the United States army, which was "one of the conditions for the incorporation of the Dutch Indonesian Army into the United States army." Under pressure from the Dutch colonial authorities, the Hatta government has already expressed its surrender. Aneta News Agency quoted qualified persons from the Hatta government as commenting on the matter, saying: "He admitted that the appointment was incomplete, and Dutch Indonesian officers will definitely be able to participate in the command of the Indonesian United States Army in the future."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 13th: American monopoly capital is expanding its activities in Indonesia. According to TASS, The Hague, January 11th: More and more American businessmen are arriving in Jakarta one after another. The Indonesian puppet government is working hard to grant the United States the right to monopolize Indonesia's rich resources. Sumitro, the Indonesian Chargé d'Affaires in the United States, with the former Dutch Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Zmeiman, as his "advisor," is negotiating with American monopoly capitalists in New York and Washington for loans. According to the United Press, Sumitro revealed: In addition to loans, the "United States of Indonesia" also hopes to obtain "American technical assistance and opportunities for our young people to receive training in the United States."

    【新华社北京十三日电】荷兰帝国主义将直接指挥印尼傀儡。据荷方安尼塔通讯社十日讯：“印尼合众国”内阁对于最近参谋长的任命，发生尖锐的争辩。争辩的发生是由于荷兰当局认为哈达内阁中的国防部长波乌诺，没有任命属于荷兰殖民地武装部队的“荷印军”人员参加合众国军高级指挥部，而这正是“荷印军并入合众国军的条件之一”。在荷兰殖民当局的压力下，哈达政府业已表示屈服。安尼塔通讯社引哈达政府有资格人士评论此事称：“他承认任命是不完全的，荷印军官将来一定能够参加印尼合众国军的指挥部”。
    【新华社北京十三日电】美国垄断资本正在印尼扩大活动。据塔斯社海牙十一日讯：愈来愈多的美国商人络续到达雅加达。印尼傀儡政府正在致力给予美国以垄断印尼富源的权利。以荷兰前驻荷属东印度总督兹麦曼为“顾问”的印尼驻美代办苏米特罗，正在纽约和华盛顿与美国垄断资本家谈判，要求贷款。据合众社报道，苏米特罗透露：“印尼合众国”除贷款外，并希望得到“美国的技术援助，以及使我们的青年人有在美国受训的机会”。
