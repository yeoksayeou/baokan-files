    The Beijing Tram Company's First Year
    Lu Niangao
    During the final years of Japanese occupation and the early period of Kuomintang reactionary rule, only a dozen or so trams ran on the streets of Beijing each day. The cars were packed with people, and even more hung on the outside. Despite so many passengers, revenue was extremely low because those in uniform didn't pay for tickets, and those in plain clothes would just shake their heads to avoid paying. Those who didn't pay tickets were also prone to beating people, and the tram company relied on mortgaging properties and machinery and underpaying wages to stay afloat. After a year of "taking over" by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the average daily operation was only forty-five trams. By the eve of liberation, the situation had deteriorated to the point where only one tram was running on the streets one day.
    After the liberation of Beijing, the People's Government took over the tram company. Of the 146 dilapidated trams, only thirty or forty were operational. All the cars were too old, and a major overhaul would cost nearly as much as building a new car. Furthermore, the warehouses were empty; not even two feet of white cloth could be found. To celebrate the first "May Day" Labor Day after liberation, Hu Quanggui, an electrician in the repair shop, and two others proposed the "Hundred-Tram Movement" on March 15th, aiming to have a hundred trams running by "May Day." This initiative immediately received support from the Party, the government, the labor union, and the workers. The entire electrician team of twenty-six people volunteered to work three extra hours each day from March 18th to April 2nd to repair the electric rollers. Under the mobilization of the production committee, workers' efficiency generally increased. The metalworkers' team overturned the previous piecework system of paying extra for making copper heads (parts for the electric roller core), and turned to volunteer overtime. Previously, making a copper head was rated at fifty-five work points, but now some completed it with only seven work points. Under these circumstances, the Hundred-Tram Movement was completed a month ahead of schedule. A celebration rally was held on April 19th, but due to inadequate security, on the night of April 24th, special agents set fire to fifty-eight trams. Many workers burst into tears, filled with anger. However, encouraged and consoled by the People's Government, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, workers from various factories, and students from various schools, the repair shop employees solemnly proposed to complete the Hundred-Tram Movement for a second time. At that time, the company's administration, considering the lack of materials and the various difficulties of construction after the fire, estimated that it would take until the following May to get another hundred trams running. They planned to exchange mercury rectifiers and rails in Tianjin for some tram bodies and wanted to ask workers from Changxindian to help with the repairs. But the repair shop workers rejected this suggestion, determined to use their own hands to respond to the shameless destruction by the special agents. They guaranteed: eighty-four trams by "July 1st" and another hundred by the October Revolution Day.
    Under the leadership and financial assistance of the Municipal Bureau of Industry, the repair shop employees cleaned up the fire site and rushed to repair the vehicles. They formed "Production Liaison Groups," volunteering for overtime, contributing materials, utilizing waste, and practicing economy. Despite the shortage of personnel and materials, they not only completed the plan on time but also repaired an extra old locomotive, bringing the number of trams running by "July 1st" to eighty-five. Afterwards, they were even more confident and overcame the unexpected obstacle of a heavy rain in August damaging thirty trams. By October 25th, not only was the hundred-tram goal achieved again ahead of schedule, but three extra trams were also repaired. Recalling the tragic scene of the fire that destroyed fifty-eight trams, the workers excitedly said: "In the Kuomintang era, not to mention such a big fire, even a smaller one would have shut down the tram company."
    During the second Hundred-Tram Movement, to overcome the difficulty of lacking parts, Huang Bojin, director of the repair shop, and workers Li Qunchang, Yuan Fengxiang, Xin Wenshan, Liu Mengxing, and others independently manufactured fire-glass rings and automatic brake boxes, which had not been made in over twenty years. The old worker Yuan Fengxiang relied on working six hours a day in private factories during the Japanese occupation to make a living. In the year before liberation, his family relied on getting up before dawn to sell cigarette butts at the morning market. He was not alone in this; eight out of ten workers in the factory were engaged in side businesses, such as peddling rickshaws or selling scraps. In the factory, getting two hours of work a day was considered good. The materials were wasted because they were used piecemeal, let alone things like fire-glass rings.
    In coordination with the emergence of a hundred trams, technicians and workers at the converter plant automatically explored the repair of mercury rectifiers that had been brought in by the Japanese over six years ago but had never been touched. With the assistance of technicians from Dalian, the trial repair was successfully completed by the end of last year, and these two rectifiers will officially generate electricity in February this year.
    Another major event following the second completion of the Hundred-Tram Movement was the implementation of the crew responsibility system (contract system). Since the establishment of the tram company twenty-five years ago, a rotating system had been in place. If a tram had a problem, it would be returned for repair, and the driver would take a break. Because the driver was not driving a fixed tram, they were unfamiliar with the tram's problems, making it easier for the tram to break down. In June last year, driver Ren Changchun, ticket seller Lu Jixun, and others, inspired and moved by a film called "The Bridge," formed a competition team, put forward the slogan of taking care of passengers and loving the vehicles, and drove organizations such as hard-working groups and study groups, laying the foundation for the crew responsibility system. After half a year of preparation by the company's Party, government, labor union, and Youth League, raising the awareness of the tramway employees and inspiring their enthusiasm, the crew responsibility system was officially implemented on November 12th. At this time, driver Ran Shixin and others practiced the call of "a hero drives a broken car" and volunteered to drive broken cars. Some drivers automatically carried tools such as pliers and screwdrivers, and immediately repaired small problems when they encountered them. With the responsibility and mutual assistance of the employees, the breakdown rate was significantly reduced. In the month before liberation, the average daily number of breakdowns accounted for 21 percent of the number of trams in operation, but by the end of last year, it had been reduced to 8 percent. Since the company adopted this system, it has reduced a large amount of loss.
    In the past year, although the tram company had certain shortcomings in its work, such as insufficient democratic management and an imperfect working system, in the first year of liberation, the company's Party, government, and labor union gradually corrected the shortcomings that had been discovered. In the initial period of the takeover, the head of the takeover team lacked a democratic style, but he frankly made a self-criticism at the provisional employee representative meeting. Some workers had opinions about the CCP tram company branch, and the branch secretary reviewed the relationship between the Party and the masses at the branch meeting and invited non-Party union members to participate. At the employee representative meeting at that time, the representatives pointed out four people, including the deputy director of the business office and the deputy chief of the inspection section, who had oppressed workers and engaged in corruption before liberation. These four people were immediately suspended. Factory management committees were established in the power plant and repair shop. Employees' salaries were guaranteed in real terms. The walls of the repair shop were painted white, and the drainage ditches for repairing vehicles were cleared. Employees have begun to cooperate closely. Chen Qichang, director of the power plant, was inspired by the active work of the workers and automatically wanted to resign from his part-time job at an outside school to concentrate on leading the work of the power plant. When repairing the No. 1 generator, he worked day and night with the workers. In the year since liberation, all the company's employees have used production to demonstrate their position as masters. From February to December last year, the number of absenteeism on the tramway was reduced from 537 to 14, and the number of trams in operation increased from an average of 56 per day to 89. Recently, the workers in the repair shop have implemented an inspection system and a voucher-based work recording system. With a clear division of labor, the labor productivity of forgers, metalworkers, and machinists has increased by 30 to 50 percent. Based on the efforts of all employees in the past year, the company has decided to build 18 new trams and overhaul 24 in 1950. From March, 95 trams will be in operation every day, and from November, 100 trams will be in operation every day.

    一年来的北京电车公司
    卢念高
    在日寇统治的末期和国民党反动统治初期，北京每天只有十几辆电车在街上跑。车里挤满了人，车外还挂满了人。乘客这么多，收入却特别少。因为穿制服的不打票，穿便服的摇摇头也不用打票。不打票的还专打人，电车公司就靠着抵押房产机器、少发薪资来维持。国民党反动派“劫收”了一年，每天平均不过才开出四十五辆。到解放前夕，竟惨到有一天只有一辆车在街上幌。
    北京解放后，人民政府接管电车公司，当时的一百四十六辆破车里，能开的只有三四十辆。所有的车，都车龄过老，大修一次要和造一辆新车差不多。而且库房空空，连二尺白布都找不出。为了迎接解放后第一个“五一”劳动节，修造厂电工胡泉桂等三人在三月十五日提出百辆车运动的口号，要在“五一”出车百辆。当时马上得到党、政、工的赞助和工人的响应。电工全班二十六人，从三月十八日到四月二日，每天义务加班三小时，赶修电滚子。在生产委员会的动员下，工人工作效率，普遍提高。案工班推翻了以前做铜头（电滚子心的零件）另外给钱的包件制，变成了义务加班。以前作一个铜头定五十五工，这时，有的用七个工就完成了。在这种情形下，一个月后，就提前完成了百辆车运动。四月十九日，曾开大会庆祝，但是由于保卫工作的不健全，四月二十四日夜晚，竟被特务分子放火烧掉了五十八辆。当时许多工人，痛哭失声，愤怒万分。但是，在人民政府、市总工会筹委会、各厂工人和各校学生的鼓励和慰问下，修造厂职工，庄严地提出，要二次完成百辆车运动。当时公司行政上曾考虑到工人器材的缺乏，以及火后施工的种种困难，估计要再出百辆车，恐怕要到来年五月，准备用水银整流器和铁轨，到天津去换一部分车箱，并想请长辛店的工人来帮着修造。但是修造厂工人否决了这个意见，他们要用自己的手来回答特务的无耻破坏。他们保证：“七一”出车八十四辆，十月革命节再来它个一百辆。
    在市工业局的领导和财力帮助下，修造厂职工，清理火场，赶修车辆。组成“生产联系组”，义务加班，献交器材、利用废物、生产节约，虽然在缺人缺料的情况下，他们不只准时完成了计划，而且还多修出一辆老机车，使“七一”出车八十五辆。以后，更信心百倍，克服了八月里大雨泡坏三十辆车的意外障碍，到十月二十五日，不只百辆车再度提前完成，而且还多修出三辆。工人们回想起火烧五十八辆车时的惨状，都兴奋地说：在国民党时代，不用说这么大的火，就是再小一点，电车公司也就关门了。
    在二次修造百辆车的过程中，为了克服机件缺乏的困难，修造厂的厂长黄伯金和工人李群昌、袁凤祥、辛文山、刘梦星等，自造了二十多年从来没做过的火玻璃圈和自动闸盒。老工人袁凤祥在日寇统治时期，靠着每天到私营工厂去做六个钟头的外活来维持生活。在解放前一年，他全家生活又靠着起五更到晓市去卖烟头来维持。当时不只他一人如此，全厂十分之八都做着副业，有蹬三轮的，有卖破烂的。在厂子里，一天给做两个钟头的活儿就算好的。整材料因为零着用都给糟蹋了，更不用提什么火玻璃圈不火玻璃圈。
    配合着百辆车的出现，变流厂技师和工人自动摸索着修理六年前日寇运来、一直没人动的水银整流器。在大连来的技师协助下，去年年底已经试修成功，今年二月这两架整流器就将正式发电。
    继二次完成百辆车运动的另一件大事就是实行乘务负责制（包乘制）。从电车公司成立那天起，二十五年来，都是轮乘制。车子有点毛病，就开回修理，司机就休息了。司机因为驾驶的不是固定车子，不熟悉车子的毛病，因而更容易坏车。在去年六月，司机员任长春、售票员陆纪勋等，看到了一部电影片名叫：《桥》，受了感动和启发，就成立了竞赛小组，提出照顾乘客、爱护车辆的口号，带动了勤劳小组、学习小组等组织，打下了乘务负责制的基础。公司的党、政、工、团，经过了半年的酝酿，提高车路员工的觉悟，启发了他们的积极性，在十一月十二日，正式实行乘务负责制。这时，司机冉世新等，实践了“好汉开坏车”的号召，自动要开破车。有的司机自动带着钳子和螺丝刀等工具，遇见小毛病就马上修理。在员工的负责和互助下，坏车率显著减低。解放前一个月，平均每日坏车数占出车数百分之二十一，到去年年底，已减到百分之八。自从该公司采用了这个制度，便减少了大量的损失。
    一年来，电车公司在工作上虽然存在着某些缺点，例如民主管理做得还不够，工作制度还没有健全，但是在解放的第一年中，该公司的党、政、工各方面，曾经逐步纠正已经发现的缺点。接管初期，接管组长民主作风不够，但是他在临时职工代表会上坦白地作了自我批评；有些工人对中共电车公司支部有意见，支部书记就在支部会上检讨了党和群众的关系，还邀请非党员的工会委员参加。在当时职工代表会上，代表们指出在解放前欺压工人、营私舞弊的营业处副处长、稽查股副股长等四个人，这四个人马上被停职了。发电厂和修造厂都成立了工厂管理委员会。职工的薪资得到折实的保证。修造厂的墙刷白了，修车地沟也清理了。职工已开始密切合作，发电厂厂长陈启昌，受到工人积极工作的影响自动要辞掉在外面学校的兼职，专心领导发电厂的工作。在修理一号发电机时，他不分昼夜地和工人一同工作。解放一年来，公司全体职工，已用生产说明了他们主人翁的地位。去年从二月到十二月，车路上的脱班工数从五百三十七减到十四，出车数从平均每天五十六辆增到八十九辆。最近修造厂工人已实行检验制度、传票记工制度。由于有了明确分工，锻工、案工、机工的劳动生产率提高了百分之三十到五十。在一年来全体职工努力的基础上，公司决定了一九五○年要再造新车十八辆，大修二十四辆。三月起每天开出九十五辆，十一月起就要每天开出一百辆。
