    Education Content Suits Students' Needs
    Development of Workers' Night Schools in the Fifth District
    [Our Dispatch] Beijing's Fifth District Workers' Night Schools are progressing as they have been conducting education based on the specific requirements of the worker students, and everyone's enthusiasm for learning is gradually increasing. When the district began organizing worker night schools in April of last year, it was sponsored by the District Government's Culture and Education Section, with the trade union only assisting. The Culture and Education Section did not have much understanding of the workers' situation, and the educational content was disorganized and did not meet the needs of the students. In addition, the teaching methods were rigid, and the students' enthusiasm for learning was very low, calling the classes "boring meetings." In light of the above situation, in August, the district hired principals and teachers from elementary schools such as the Fifth District Central Elementary School and Qian Yuan'ensi Elementary School to serve as cultural instructors. In terms of leadership, the District Trade Union directly took charge and designated cadres to serve as political instructors for each night school. In this way, the night schools improved compared to before. On the one hand, the night schools could be well integrated with the labor movement, using the night schools to convey and deploy trade union work, and resolve labor-capital disputes, etc., making workers feel that the night schools were closely related to themselves. On the other hand, in terms of teaching content, the principle of "teach whatever the students need" was adopted. For example, the Qiujia Hutong Night School taught the method of mutual calculation of jin and liang [traditional Chinese units of weight], and the multiplication table; the female workers' night school at Fu Jen Catholic University taught abacus calculation; and the stevedore team established an accounting class, making learning closely integrated with needs, and the workers were very satisfied. Through night school studies, the workers in the district have made progress in both political and cultural aspects. After the store clerks night school students recognized the truth that labor creates the world, their labor viewpoint was strengthened, and they often took shovels and hoes to repair the night school's playground, and carried soil and removed manure. Zhao Mingju, a former Qian Yuan'ensi student who originally knew very few characters, is now able to write simple letters home. Currently, there are 24 night schools in the district, with 1,285 students. Recently, the district held examinations and evaluations, and selected four excellent worker schools and sixty outstanding students, as well as sixteen learning models.

    教育内容适合学员需要
    五区工人夜校发展
    【本报讯】北京市第五区工人夜校依据工人学员具体要求，进行教育，大家学习情绪渐趋高涨，工作得到开展。该区去年四月开始组织工人夜校时，是由区政府文教科主办，工会只是协助性质。文教科因对工人情形了解不多，教育内容杂乱，不合学员需要。加以教授方式死板，学员学习情绪甚低，称上课为“开闷头会”。根据以上情况，该区于八月间，聘请了五区中心小学、前圆恩寺等小学校长、教员等担任文化教员；在领导问题上也由区工会直接负责，指定干部担任各夜校政治教员。这样，夜校便较前有了起色。一方面，夜校与工运可以很好的结合，通过夜校来传达、布置工会工作，解决劳资纠纷等问题，使工人觉得夜校与自己有密切关系。另一方面，在教学内容上采取了“学员需要什么就教授什么”的方针，如邱家胡同夜校教斤两互求法、九九表，辅仁大学的女工夜校教珠算，搬运组成立了会计班，使学习与需要密切结合起来，工人都觉得很满意。通过夜校学习，该区工人在政治、文化各方面都较前有了进步。店员夜校学员认清了劳动创造世界的真理后，劳动观点加强了，经常自己拿了锹、镐修理夜校的操场，并抬土、除粪。原先识字很少的前圆恩寺学员赵鸣举，现在已能写简单的家信了。现全区已有夜校二十四处，学员一千二百八十五人。日前该区举行考试、评等，选出了四个优等工人学校及六十名优等生、十六名学习模范。
