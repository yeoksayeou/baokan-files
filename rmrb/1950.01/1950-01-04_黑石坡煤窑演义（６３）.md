　　The third elder was busy enough on this day too. He led people to tidy up the bottom of the kiln, arrange the ventilation pipe passages, plan where to install air doors, and calculate how many branches to dig coal in the future... He didn't go to sleep until the next day's rooster crowed; he hadn't touched the bed for three days and three nights, and as soon as he lay down, he slept soundly. He didn't even attend the village's celebration of the land reform victory and the opening of the large kiln's ventilation pipe. Little Foreign Devil noticed this and said he would go call him, but Shuancheng wouldn't let him, saying to let the third elder rest. So, the meeting started at the bottom of the opera stage, with speeches, opinions, and primary school students performing the "Overlord Whip Dance," which was quite lively, and people forgot about the third elder. Until the meeting was about to end, and the village youths were preparing to perform a play, Little Foreign Devil suddenly saw the third elder sitting on the grinding disc at the foot of the slope opposite the opera stage. He quickly shouted, "Uncle Third Elder, look, people are saying they want to welcome you! You..." Then, a crowd of people, big and small, ran up and pulled the third elder onto the opera stage, and the applause was thunderous. Niu Bao even deliberately led the shouting of slogans to welcome him to speak, but he was too embarrassed to raise his head, but he couldn't escape, as the children were缠住了 him. After a long time, he finally said, "What can I say? We worked together to build a kiln, learned a lot of new principles together, and everyone put in a lot of effort. I even lost weight. In a word: Although I've lost weight and everyone has sweated a lot, the kiln is built, and everyone has truly shown their strength. We have truly stood up and been liberated." After speaking, he hurriedly ran down the opera stage, only to see that people's eyes were still following him. His face was flushed, and he kept running up the slope. Little Foreign Devil strode to catch up with him and said, "Aren't you watching the play?" He stopped, turned his head, and smiled, "Is it the famous play 'Butterfly Cup'?" Little Foreign Devil said, "No! This is a new play that the youths have learned, called 'Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang,' it's really good! I secretly watched them rehearsing it." The third elder laughed again, "Better than 'Butterfly Cup'?" Little Foreign Devil said, "Uh, I don't really understand that play, but old folks all say it's good. How can it compare to this play? This is about our own affairs, it's worth watching! Let's go!" The two then went back to sit on the grinding disc and watch the play. At this moment, Willow Ditch's family emerged from somewhere, with an apricot blossom in her hair, winking and making mischief. She said to the third elder, "You must watch this play properly! Humph! I'm afraid you'll have to treat me after watching the play! You have to, whether you want to or not!" Seeing the old woman looking both angry and happy, the third elder couldn't help but feel his heart beat faster. Later, after watching the play for a while, Shuancheng took advantage of people's inattention and quietly pulled the third elder behind the opera stage and said, "Willow Ditch's family has arranged things with the Baiquan family! Uncle Third Elder, just waiting for you..." Little Foreign Devil found them again. He somehow saw through what Shuancheng was saying at a glance and also said to the third elder, "You have to make a firm decision right away! This is different from that time a long time ago!" The third elder lowered his head, his face red and his heart pounding, and he still didn't say a word. Little Foreign Devil whispered again, "It was originally like that! Baiquan's family ran into a life of serving the wealthy, and in those years, it was impossible for her not to be abused by the landlord! Uncle Third Elder, think more clearly about this!" Shuancheng hurriedly said, "What are you saying?" The third elder also said, "The world has been completely turned upside down, why are you still talking about that!" Little Foreign Devil said, "Then you have no objections?" Tianlu's couple also came over. Tianlu stood next to the third elder, took a few puffs from his dry tobacco pipe, and then said, "Third Brother! You should decide now!" Tianlu's wife said, "Third Brother! We also helped to arrange things with her, and she really has no objections, it's all up to you!" The third elder's heart was pounding wildly. He thought: it seemed that he had thought about this matter several times before, and it seemed that he was really going to have a big turn-around and a big liberation! He thought of his white silk pants and the woman who sewed those pants for him... He grabbed Shuancheng and quietly said, "Tell her again! I have no objections." Little Foreign Devil quickly leaned in to inquire about Shuancheng, when suddenly they heard a commotion and thunderous applause in front of the opera stage. It turned out that the play was about to end, and it was the scene where Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang got married.
        
　　Fifty-Nine Joining the Party

　　After the village held the celebration meeting, the third elder and Baiquan's family officially got engaged in front of the cadres. Immediately afterwards, the third elder found Lao Bai and Lao Yin and asked about the Communist Party. It turned out that there had never been any Communist Party members in this village. Only two months ago, Lao Yin was the first to introduce Shuancheng to join, and later Lao Yin also publicized and called for support at various meetings, and talked with individuals, so that seven other people including Bian Xiaotianlu joined. Lao Yin had also thought about introducing the third elder, but when he thought of the third elder's shortcomings, he was a little unsure. It wasn't until Lao Bai studied this matter at the district committee meeting and felt that the third elder was very suitable to join that Lao Yin decided to find the third elder. However, the third elder was very busy at the time, and Lao Yin only had Shuancheng mention it to the third elder a couple of times, so the matter was delayed. Now, the third elder asked Lao Bai and Lao Yin, "Do you think my materials are good enough to join the Communist Party??" Lao Yin said, "Didn't I say these things at the meeting before? And Shuancheng also mentioned it to you, right!" The third elder said, "I've heard a lot, but I'm not very clear about the inner details; besides, the big kiln wasn't successful before, and the ventilation pipe didn't go through, my mind wasn't on this, and I also felt embarrassed to mention this matter at that time." Lao Bai and Lao Yin each spoke for a while, explaining everything about the Communist Party very carefully. The third elder crouched on the ground, constantly saying "Hmm, hmm!" After listening, the third elder hurriedly said, "This Communist Party is our own party! Do you think I'm good enough?" At this time, Lao Bai pointed out many shortcomings of the third elder, and Lao Yin also said some things. The third elder made many self-criticisms, and some shortcomings he was not very clear about himself. Lao Bai and Lao Yin enlightened him for a while. Finally, Lao Yin said, "We and the district have no major objections to your joining the party, but we also want to hear the opinions of the masses. We will hold a meeting tomorrow to establish a party branch, so you should solicit everyone's opinions!"

    黑石坡煤窑演义（６３）
    康濯
    大三这一天也是忙了个够。他领人打整窑底，拾掇风筒行道，计议哪里安设风门，盘算往后分几道岔刨炭……直到第二天鸡叫，他才去睡；他是三天三夜没挨着炕了，这阵一躺下，不觉睡得结结实实地，村里庆祝土地改革胜利和大窑透开风筒的大会，他也没参加，小洋鬼发觉了这，才说要去叫他，拴成却不让他去，说要让大三歇歇。于是，大会在戏楼底开起来，讲话，提意见，小学生打霸王鞭，好不热闹，人们也把大三忘了；直到会快开完，村里青年们准备演戏的时候，小洋鬼忽地见大三在戏楼对面坡根底那个碾盘上坐着，他忙一声吆喝：“大三叔，你看人们正说要欢迎你哩！你……”接着，跑上去一堆大小人，一把就把大三拉到戏楼上，下边巴掌拍得一片响，牛宝还故意领头喊口号欢迎他讲话，他却羞得抬不起头，可又跑不脱，孩孩娃娃们缠住了他；他老半天才说：“咱这能说甚么？咱跟大伙一道闹成了个窑，跟大伙一道学了很多新事理，大伙卖了很多力气，我这身子也掉了膘。一句话：虽说是咱人瘦了，赔了一身膘，大伙也流了很多汗，可窑闹成了，大伙真个显出力量了，咱们可真个是翻身解放了。”说完，他急忙忙跑下戏楼，只见人们的眼还都跟着他转，他满脸发热，就一个劲往坡上跑去；小洋鬼迈开大步赶上他道：“你不看戏么？”他立下来，回过头笑道：“又是名戏‘蝴蝶杯’么？”小洋鬼道：“不！这是人家青年们学的新戏，叫甚么‘王贵李香香’，可好哩！他们学戏那工夫，我悄悄见来着。”大三又笑道：“比‘蝴蝶杯’还好？”小洋鬼道：“呃，那戏咱也不很懂，不过是老年月人们都说好?可怎比这戏？这演的就是咱自己的事，有看头哩！走吧！”二人就又走到碾盘上坐着看戏。这时柳沟家不知从哪里钻了出来，她头上插着朵杏花，挤眉弄眼地不知鬼捣甚么，对大三说：“这戏你可得正经看看哩！哼！怕你看了戏还得请请我！不请还是不行！”看这老婆子又像生气又像欢喜的，大三不觉也心跳起来。后来，看了一阵戏，拴成趁人们不注意，悄悄把大三拉过戏楼后边说：“柳沟家给白泉家说合好了哩！大三叔，只等你……”小洋鬼这家伙又寻来了，他不知怎么一眼就看穿了拴成说的事，也对大三道：“这可得立时拿个准主意呀！这又跟老年月那回不同的！”大三低着脑袋，脸红心乱跳，还是不啃声；小洋鬼又悄悄道：“原本是嘛！白泉家碰对了个侍候老财的命，那年月，要人家不受财主糟塌也是不行！大三叔，这上头想开些吧！”拴成忙说：“你这说甚么哩？”大三也道：“世道都大翻了个过，还说那哩！”小洋鬼说：“那你没意见了么？”天禄两口子也赶了过来，天禄圪?到大三身边，通了会子旱烟袋才说：“老三！这会你该准定了吧！”天禄老婆说：“三兄弟！咱也跟人家捣拉来着，人家可是正经没啥意见，就看你哩！”大三心眼卜通乱跳，他想着：好像前些时自己就思谋过好几回这事情的，看来自己是真个要大翻身大解放了！他想起了自己那条白绸裤，和给他缝那裤子的女人……他拉住拴成悄悄说：“你再给说说吧！咱没意见。”小洋鬼赶忙凑上去讯问拴成，这时却听得戏楼前边人声哄乱，巴掌也拍得一片响，原来戏快演完，演到王贵和李香香结婚了。
            五十九  入党
    村里开过庆贺大会以后，大三和白泉家就当着干部们的面，正式订了婚。紧接着，大三又找老白和老尹，问讯共产党的事。原来这村一直没有共产党员，只两个月以前，老尹头一个介绍拴成参加了，后来老尹又在各种会议上宣传、号召，并找个别人谈话，才又有扁小天禄等七个人参加；老尹也曾想过要介绍大三，但他想起大三那些毛病，又有些拿不准主意，直到老白在区委会上研究了这件事，觉着大三很可以参加，老尹这才决定寻大三捣拉，不过当时大三正忙，老尹只让拴成给大三提说过两回，事情就这么耽误下来了。现在，大三问老白和老尹道：“你们看咱这材料也能参加共产党?？”老尹道：“早先我不是在会上说过这些么？还有拴成也跟你捣拉过的吧！”大三说：“听倒是听说过不少，可这内里一切情由咱还摸不很清；再说，前些时大窑没成，风筒没透，咱这心思不在这上头，咱也觉着那阵子没脸面提说这事的。”老白老尹就一人说一段，很细致地给解释共产党的一切情由，大三圪?②在地下，一边听一边不断“嗯，嗯！”赶听完，大三忙道：“这共产党可是咱自己的党呀！你们看我行么？”老白这时却给大三指出了不少毛病，老尹也说了一些，大三自己就作了很多检讨，有些毛病他自己还闹不很清的，老白老尹又给他开导了一阵；最后，老尹道：“咱们和区里对你参加党是没多的意见，不过咱们还想听听群众们的意见，明天开会成立党的支部，你自己征求征求大伙吧！”
