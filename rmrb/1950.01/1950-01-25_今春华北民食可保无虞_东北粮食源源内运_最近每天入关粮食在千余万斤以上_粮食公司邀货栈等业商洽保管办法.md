    This Spring, North China's Food Supply Can Be Guaranteed
    Grain from the Northeast Flows Inward
    Recent Daily Grain Entry Exceeds Ten Million Jin
    Grain Company Invites Warehouses and Other Businesses to Discuss Storage Methods
    [Tianjin News] Thanks to the steady flow of coarse grains from the Northeast, North China's grain supply is now largely guaranteed for this spring. Since its establishment last September, the North China Grain Company has concentrated its efforts on overcoming difficulties in transportation and storage, and has transferred a large amount of coarse grains from the Northeast into the region. As of the 18th of this month, the total has reached over 400,000 tons, and the transfer is continuing at an accelerated pace. Recently, the daily grain entering the region has been between 12 million and 18 million jin, mostly corn, followed by sorghum, and other miscellaneous grains.

    The grain entering the region has been transferred by the Grain Company to various parts of North China, especially disaster areas such as Tangshan and Cangxian, and cotton-producing areas such as Shijiazhuang, Linqing, Baoding, and Hengshui. It is supplied to disaster victims and cotton farmers through local cooperatives, production and disaster relief organizations, and cotton purchasing agencies. The remaining part is stored in Tianjin and Beijing to ensure the supply for the urban working people and to adjust supplies in various regions at any time.

    Storing such a huge amount of grain, tens of millions of jin, is not a simple task. Moreover, due to the climate in the Northeast, the grain has a higher moisture content (generally between 18% and 20%), which further increases the difficulty of storage. Currently, the Tianjin Grain Company is exploring various ways to do this work well. First, the grain will be stored separately according to its moisture content, and used in order of moisture content. Secondly, part of the grain will be allocated to relevant units for decentralized storage, and a portion will be allocated to disaster areas such as the Tianjin Special Zone. In recent days, the Grain Company has been consulting with relevant units such as the Tianjin Retail Company and the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, to have the Grain Company allocate two to three months' worth of grain to be stored on their behalf in conjunction with supply. Specific methods are currently being studied. In addition, the company is also preparing to entrust businesses such as Tianjin warehouses, wholesale grain, retail grain, and Sanjin Mills to store part of the grain, utilizing their warehouses and manpower for storage and drying, and paying handling fees or deducting a certain amount of loss based on the length of time and actual conditions. The company invited the chairmen of the Tianjin four-industry associations on the 18th to discuss this issue. Each industry is now soliciting opinions from member businesses and investigating storage capacity, and specific storage methods will be agreed upon within days.

    今春华北民食可保无虞
    东北粮食源源内运
    最近每天入关粮食在千余万斤以上
    粮食公司邀货栈等业商洽保管办法
    【天津讯】由于东北粗粮的源源入关，今春华北的粮食供应已获重要保障。华北粮食公司自去年九月成立后，即集中力量，克服运输保管等困难，自东北调运大批粗粮入关，截至本月十八日，共达四十万余吨，现仍继续加紧调运，最近每天入关的粮食，有一千二百万斤至一千八百万斤，其中多为玉米，次为高粱，另有其它杂粮。
    入关的粮食已由粮食公司分别调运华北各地，特别是唐山、沧县等地灾区和石家庄、临清、保定、衡水等地产棉区，通过各地合作社、生产救灾组织和收棉机构，供应灾民和棉农。其余一部则存储于天津、北京两地，经常保证城市劳动人民的供给和随时调剂各地。
    数万万斤的巨量粮食的保管不是一件简单容易的事，而且东北粮食由于气候的关系，水份较多（一般在百分之十八至百分之二十之间），更增加了保管的困难，目前天津粮食公司正在想各种办法作好这一工作，首先，粮食将根据水份多少，分别保管，并分别先后动用。其次并将一部拨交有关单位，分散保存，并拨一部分给天津专区等灾区。连日来，粮食公司正与天津市零售公司、市供销合作总社等有关单位商洽，由粮食公司拨给二至三个月的粮食，结合供应代为保存，具体办法现正在研究中。此外，该公司并准备委托天津市货栈、批发粮食、零售粮食、三津磨坊等业商户代储部分食粮，利用各业的仓库和人手，作保管和晾晒工作，并按期间长短和实际情况付给手续费或扣除一定量的损耗。该公司已于十八日邀请天津该四业公会主任委员讨论该项问题，现各业正在征询会员商户的意见和调查储量中，日内即可商定出具体的代储办法。
