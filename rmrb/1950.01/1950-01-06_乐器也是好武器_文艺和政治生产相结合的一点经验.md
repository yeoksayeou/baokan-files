Musical instruments are also good weapons
Some experience in combining literature and art with political production
Tian Geng
    "Only when literature and art are combined with political production can they play a role and be consolidated and developed." We have already acknowledged this statement in theory, but we do not have a deeper understanding in our minds. For example: "How can literature and art cooperate with political production?" "What role do literature and art actually play in politics and production?" We do not have a clear understanding of this, and it is difficult to make a specific estimate. Take the accompaniment group as an example. We thought: "What direct help can these musical instruments provide to politics and production? At most, they can only cooperate with the performances of song and dance troupes, drama troupes, and the broadcasts of broadcasting groups." However, through our factory's "Summary and Award Ceremony for Repair Furnace No. 14," we had a new perspective.
    This conference was held on December 9th. Four hours before the meeting, the labor union asked the accompaniment group if they could provide accompaniment during the award ceremony. In a hurry, the accompaniment group found four people to practice the song of the labor heroes. Before leaving, they felt that everyone might not understand this song, so they decided to have Wang Yan sing it, and also found five people from the harmonica team to play a few songs. Several people sat in the back of the venue.
    The meeting began. Before the award ceremony, comrades from the production department reported on the evaluation criteria, the list of labor models, and their meritorious deeds. One young worker, in order not to delay production, came to the factory to work overtime on the third day of his honeymoon. An elderly worker was so tired from work that he could not straighten his back. Young workers ran over to massage his back and told him to rest, but he kept working. Some workers returned equipment that had been stolen during the Kuomintang era, some invented new tools, and some created new working methods... One thing after another, everyone listened carefully, and the atmosphere of the meeting was very serious. After the report, the front shouted, "Awards!" and the music started, and the atmosphere of the entire venue changed immediately. The front read the names of the award recipients, and the back played music, as if it were a happy event. Everyone clapped and kept time, and Wang Yan began to sing like a happy song: "A red flower is red, so red! Yo hey! So red! Labor heroes are respected by everyone, everyone respects..." When he first started singing, everyone felt strange and turned to look back. But after hearing him sing naturally, as if he was talking to everyone, they knew that this was not a performance, so they listened while clapping and keeping time. When he sang "Everyone applauds to welcome," the applause really rang out enthusiastically. The musical instruments kept playing, and the front continued to shout the names of the model workers. When the name of the newlywed young worker was read, Wang Yan sang again: "Young heroes walk, walk forward... Labor heroes are truly glorious, truly glorious." The worker next to him said: "Truly glorious! This is more lively than a happy event!" When the name of the old hero was read, Wang Yan continued to sing: "Old heroes walk onto the stage, walk, walk onto the stage, shout to comrades to pay attention, suffered for so many years, the new society wants us to show our skills..." Everyone suddenly became quiet when they heard this, listening to the sincere song while thinking straight, and the atmosphere of the entire venue rose and fell with the singing and music.
    After the awards were given, the secretary of the Party branch spoke, saying: "... This time, some departments have more people winning awards and some have fewer. I hope that everyone will compete in their work in the future. But more importantly, we must cooperate and unite in order to improve the factory." As soon as he finished speaking, the harmonica team started playing "Unity is Strength." Everyone automatically sang along. The strong singing expressed everyone's determination to respond to this call like an oath. Then Comrade Wang Wenbin spoke. He was originally an old worker, later became the deputy director of the factory, then a representative of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, and recently was elected as a member of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. He said: "... The Kuomintang reactionaries said that our Communist Party could not manage cities and factories, and that the working class was not worthy of leading. But now we see that we can not only manage cities and factories well, but also manage the country well. This is because our working class and the Communist Party have taken the lead... Our working class should always strive to be pioneers, work harder in production, and quickly industrialize the new China..." So the band played "Meritorious Service in Production," and everyone sang along: "The working class is the pioneer, we must make more meritorious service on the production front, make more meritorious service, the people's heroes are the most glorious." This song was originally a familiar song in the factory, but today it feels particularly meaningful to sing.
    Speeches, music, singing, and applause were integrated into one, and the atmosphere of the entire venue was always so tight and warm, combined with free speeches. We played "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China" and "We Workers Have Strength."
    When everyone was walking out of the venue after the meeting, "The East is Red" started playing, and everyone walked out while singing and clapping their hands, continuing to sing even after they went out. The entire conference was very successful, and everyone's reaction to the accompaniment group and the harmonica team was very good. The comrades of the labor union said with satisfaction: "This is serving the working masses!" and they gradually increased their attention to literary and artistic activities.
    The success of the conference cannot be entirely attributed to the accompaniment group and the harmonica team, but it cannot be denied that it played a certain role. This proves that when literature and art are combined with politics and production, they will fully play their role and be developed and consolidated.
    Through this work, we have realized that musical instruments are also a very good literary and artistic weapon, and we should strive to learn how to use them.

### 乐器也是好武器  文艺和政治生产相结合的一点经验

    乐器也是好武器
    文艺和政治生产相结合的一点经验
    田耕  
    “文艺和政治生产相结合，才能发挥作用，并且得到巩固与发展。”这个说法在理论上我们已经承认了，可是在思想上却没有更深的了解。譬如说：“文艺怎样才能和政治生产配合？”“文艺究竟在政治上、生产上起了多大的作用呢？”我们就没有一个明确的认识，也很难做一个具体的估计。就拿配乐组来说吧，我们就想：“这几件乐器对政治上、生产上能有什么直接的帮助呢？顶多不过配合一下歌咏团、剧团的演出和广播小组的广播罢了。”可是通过本厂的“修十四号炉总结发奖大会”，我们才有了新的看法。
    这个大会是在十二月九日举行的，在开会前的四个钟头，工会才问配乐组是不是可以在发奖的时候伴奏一下，在匆忙间配乐小组找来四个人拿劳动英雄的歌练了练就去了。在临去之前，感到这个歌大家听了也许不懂，于是就决定叫王雁唱一下，同时还找到了口琴队的五个人吹几个歌。几个人，就坐在会场的后面。
    开会了，在发奖前有生产部的同志报告评奖标准、劳模名单及其立功事迹。有一位青工为了不误生产，在新婚后的第三天，就跑到工厂来打加班。有一位老年工人，干活累得腰都直不起来了，年青的工人跑过去给他捶背，叫他歇着，可是他还干。有的工人把过去在国民党时期偷走的器材又献了出来，有的人发明了新的工具，有的人创造了新的工作方法……。一件跟着一件，大家都细心的听着，会场的情绪非常严肃。报告完了，前面才喊了一声：“发奖！”后边音乐就响开了，整个会场情绪马上为之一变。前面念着领奖人的名字，后面吹打着，就跟办喜事似的。大家都鼓着掌给打着拍子，王雁跟着就和念喜歌似的唱开了：“一朵红花红呀么红又红！哟咳！红又红！劳动英雄人人敬，人呀人人敬……。”当他刚一唱的时候，大家还觉得奇怪，都回过头来看。可是又一听他唱的顶自然，跟大伙说话似的，就知道这不是在表演，于是一边听着一边鼓着掌打拍子。当他唱到“大家鼓掌来欢迎”的时候，大家的掌声真的热烈的响起来了。乐器不断地奏着，前面继续喊着模范的名字，当念到那位新婚的青工的时候，王雁又唱起来：“年轻的英雄走呀么走上前……劳动英雄真光荣真光荣。”旁边的工人说了：“真光荣啊！这比喜事还热闹呢！”又念到老英雄的名字，王雁接着唱了下去：“老英雄走上台呀，走呀么走上台，叫声同志注意听，受苦受罪多少年，新社会要咱显本领……”大家听到这儿突然静了下来，一边听着这诚恳的歌，一边直着眼睛想事，整个会场的情绪随着歌声和音乐声而起伏着。
    奖发完了，党的支部书记讲话，他说：“……这次有的课股得奖的人多，有的人少，希望以后大家在工作上要竞赛。但更重要的是要合作，要团结，才能把工厂搞好。”他才说完，口琴队就吹开“团结就是力量”。大家都自动地跟着唱了起来。坚强的歌声就和宣誓似的表示出大家响应这个号召的决心。下面又由王文斌同志讲话，他原来是一个老工人，后来作了副厂长，又当了亚澳工会会议的代表，最近又当选为北京市人民政府委员。他说：“……国民党反动派说我们共产党不能管理城市和工厂，工人阶级不配做领导。但是现在我们看见了，我们不但能把城市工厂管理好，并且还能把国家管理好，这就是我们工人阶级、共产党作了领导的原故，……我们工人阶级应当时时刻刻争取先锋，在生产上多努力，把新中国很快地工业化起来……。”于是乐队奏起“生产立功”，大家又跟着唱了起来：“工人阶级是先锋，生产战线要多立功，多立功呀多立功，人民功臣最光荣。”这个歌本来是本厂唱熟了的一个歌，可是今天唱起来就觉得意义特别大。
    讲话、奏乐、唱歌、鼓掌溶成了一体，整个会场的情绪是一直那么紧凑热烈结合着自由讲话，我们奏了“没有共产党就没有新中国”与“咱们工人有力量”。
    在大会完了大家往外走的时候，又奏起“东方红”来了，大家一边唱着一边拍着手往外走，走出去还直唱呢。整个的大会非常成功，大家对配乐组和口琴队的反映很好，工会的同志很满意地说：“这就是给工人群众服务了！”并且对文艺活动渐加重视起来。
    大会的成功，当然不能全归功于配乐组和口琴队，可是它起了一定的作用，却不能否认。这就证明：文艺和政治、生产相结合，就会充分地发挥其作用，并且得到发展与巩固。
    通过这次工作，我们认识到了乐器也是一个非常好的文艺武器，我们应当努力去学习着使用它。
