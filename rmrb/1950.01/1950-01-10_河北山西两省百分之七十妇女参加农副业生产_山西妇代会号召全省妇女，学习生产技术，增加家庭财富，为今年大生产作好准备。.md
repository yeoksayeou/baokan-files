    Hebei and Shanxi Provinces: Seventy Percent of Women Participate in Agricultural and Sideline Production
    Shanxi Women's Congress Calls on Women Throughout the Province to Learn Production Techniques, Increase Family Wealth, and Prepare for This Year's Great Production.
    [Report from Our Newspaper] In Hebei and Shanxi provinces, over seventy percent of the vast number of rural women have actively participated in the agricultural and sideline production movement. In many areas, this figure is above eighty percent. Near Qinhuangdao, in the new Lin Yu district, twenty-three counties saw the full participation of women in field production during the busy farming season last year. They participated in harvesting crops, plowing and harrowing land, pulling drills to sow wheat, and other various labors just like the men. The number of women participating in production in Shanxi province exceeded the call of the National Women's Congress to "mobilize over fifty percent of women to participate in production." According to statistics, over fifty percent of the full and semi-labor force in the province participated in spring plowing. During the busy autumn harvest season, this reached about seventy percent.
    To overcome the difficulties of labor and animal power shortages and to improve production efficiency, the two provinces widely organized women's mutual aid in production. In Xinle County, Hebei Province, six districts had over six thousand women and three thousand men jointly organizing one thousand two hundred and sixty-one mutual aid teams. Shanxi Province also universally organized women's production through labor exchange and mutual assistance. In 754 villages in four counties including Yuci and Mengxian, 3,400 women participated in mutual aid organizations for drought resistance and planting.
            Large numbers of women participate in sideline production such as raising pigs, increasing family wealth.
    The People's Governments of both provinces attach great importance to mobilizing women to participate in sideline and handicraft production. According to incomplete statistics from Xiyang and Xugou counties in Shanxi Province alone, last spring women raised 2,000 pigs, over 76,000 chickens, over 1,200 silkworm egg sheets, dug 9,100 jin of medicinal herbs, and earned over 17,000 jin of rice by sewing shoe soles. In Weizi Town, Lucheng County, women who weave straw hat braids earn four dou and five sheng of rice per month, enough to support two people. Wang Laotaitai from Xugou hatched 26 broods of chickens in a year, exchanging them for over 700 jin of coarse grains, enough for her family's livelihood. Women in Hebei Province also universally participated in various sideline production activities. In Daming County, Hebei Province, 53,000 women participated in weaving straw hat braids. According to statistics from some villages in the disaster areas of Wen'an, Shengfang, and Baxian in the Tianjin Special District, 7,800 women participated in sideline activities such as weaving mats.
            Mobilizing women to participate in production effectively solves labor shortages
    According to local experience, where the mobilization of women to participate in agricultural and sideline production has been successful, the difficulty of labor shortages has been effectively solved, thus strengthening intensive cultivation and greatly increasing the wealth of the peasants, directly promoting agricultural production. At the same time, because women's participation in production yields results, it has also changed the erroneous idea that "women are useless." And has improved women's social status.
    In order to develop winter sideline production and strive to restore agricultural production to the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1950, the Shanxi Provincial Women's Congress determined the province's policy for mobilizing women's production in the two seasons of last winter and this spring in October of last year. It called on women to shift from spinning and all sideline occupations with no future development to raising pigs, chickens, silkworms, and weaving straw hat braids. And called on women to learn pig and chicken raising techniques, vigorously accumulate fertilizer, be diligent and thrifty in managing their households, and increase family wealth. In order to gradually accumulate capital, increase rural purchasing power, and prepare for this year's great production.

    河北山西两省百分之七十妇女参加农副业生产
    山西妇代会号召全省妇女，学习生产技术，增加家庭财富，为今年大生产作好准备。
    【本报讯】河北、山西两省广大农村妇女，百分之七十以上积极参加了农业及副业的生产运动。不少地区达百分之八十以上。秦皇岛附近、临榆新区，去年在农忙季节，有二十三县妇女全数参加了田间生产。她们和男子一样参加收割庄稼，耕耙地，拉耧种麦，以及其他各种劳动。山西省妇女参加生产者，超过了全国妇代会“动员百分之五十以上妇女参加生产”的号召。据统计，全省百分之五十以上的整、半劳动力参加了春耕。在三秋农忙阶段则达到百分之七十左右。
    为克服劳、畜力缺乏的困难，提高生产效率，该两省广泛组织了妇女的生产互助。河北省新乐县六个区，有六千多妇女和三千多男子共同组织了一千二百六十一个互助组。山西省亦普遍组织了妇女生产的变工互助。榆次、盂县等四县七百五十四个村，有三千四百妇女参加了抗旱点种的互助组织。
            广大妇女参加养猪等副业生产增加家庭财富。
    该两省人民政府都很重视发动妇女参加副业和手工业生产。仅山西省昔阳、徐沟两县不完全统计，去春妇女养猪二千口，养鸡七万六千余只，养蚕一千二百余席，刨药九千一百斤，纳鞋底赚米一万七千余斤。该省潞城微子镇妇女编草帽辫，每人每月赚米四斗五升，可养两口人。徐沟王老太太一年孵鸡二十六窝，换得杂粮七百多斤，够一家生活。河北省妇女也普遍参加了各种副业生产。该省大名县参加掏草帽辫妇女达五万三千人。天津专区的文安、胜芳、霸县等灾区一部村庄统计，妇女参加织席等副业者即达七千八百人。
            发动妇女参加生产有效解决劳力困难
    根据各地经验，凡发动妇女参加农、副业生产有成绩者，即有效地解决了劳力缺乏的困难，因而也加强了深耕细作，并大大增加了农民的财富，直接推动了农业生产。同时，由于妇女参加生产得到成果，亦改变了人们认为“妇女不顶事”的错误思想。提高了妇女的社会地位。
    为开展冬季副业生产，争取农业生产在一九五○年恢复抗日战争以前水平。去年十月间山西省妇代会上曾确定了该省去冬今春两季发动妇女生产方针。号召妇女由纺线及一切没有发展前途的副业转到养猪养鸡养蚕和编草帽辫。并号召妇女学会养猪养鸡技术，大力积肥，勤俭持家，增加家庭财富。以达到逐渐积累资本，提高农村购买力，为今年大生产作好准备。
