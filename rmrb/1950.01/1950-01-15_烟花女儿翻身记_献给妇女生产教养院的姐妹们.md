    The Redemption of a Prostitute's Daughter
    Dedicated to the Sisters of the Women's Production and Education Institute
    (Continued from Issue 31, January 8th)
           Episode Five: Falling into the Water
    It was said that just as Sun, the madam, was about to hit Gui Zhen,
    An old hag walked in from outside the door,
    Saying, "Master, please rest your hand,
    She's new here and doesn't understand the situation,
    Let me slowly persuade her,
    Slowly make her compliant to you men,
    If she still doesn't listen to my advice,
    Then you can skin her alive or pull out her tendons."
    The madam said, "Alright, I'll give you face,
    I'll give you half an hour to get back to me,
    If she doesn't listen to you,
    I'll definitely skin her alive and pull out her tendons."
    Having said that, he stormed out,
    The old hag explained the situation on the side,
    Before even opening her mouth, she let out a burst of laughter,
    Calling, "Gui Zhen, listen to me,
    I think you're really just a country girl,
    Taking these things too seriously,
    As the saying goes, everything is determined by fate,
    What's destined cannot be avoided,
    If the King of Hell decrees that you should die, you can't live,
    If the King of Hell doesn't summon you, you can't die even if you want to,
    You must have been a bad client in your previous life,
    That's why you were reborn as a prostitute in this life,
    You should accept whatever is destined for you,
    Why provoke the madam to get angry,
    You already fell into the water last night,
    Why pretend to be so virtuous,
    I advise you to obey early, and your flesh will suffer less pain,
    If you suffer in this life, you'll definitely be reborn as a rich person in the next life."
    A flood of flowery words,
    The superstitious Gui Zhen believed it to be true,
    Thinking, "I, Gui Zhen, am truly unlucky,
    My mother died when I was only eight years old,
    My stepmother treated me so harshly,
    Even my father didn't treat me like a person,
    I only wanted to escape and live on my own,
    But Deqiang was drafted into the 'Central Army',
    The two sisters worked as waitresses,
    And now I've fallen into this trap,
    The last time I tried to hang myself,
    I was saved and didn't die,
    It seems it's truly my destiny,
    That the sins of my past life are缠住住 me,
    She said, "Alright, I, Gui Zhen, accept my fate,
    I'll let people abuse me and torment me,"
    The old hag laughed upon hearing this,
    "Gui Zhen, I say you're really a smart person!"
    Pitiful, innocent little Gui Zhen,
    From then on, she became a prostitute.
    On the third day, she met Sister Jinhua,
    And learned that Jinhua had also fallen into this trap,
    The two sisters wanted to pour out their suffering together,
    But the madam glared and raised her eyebrows,
    Scaring the two sisters into trembling,
    They dared not say another word.
    People say that Coptis chinensis is bitter,
    But Gui Zhen's life was ten times more bitter than Coptis chinensis,
    Every day she was dressed up like a ghost,
    To entertain those rich men,
    During the day she was "opening the market" and "selling the store",
    At night she accompanied the guests until dawn,
    Doing "business" with twenty or thirty people every day,
    Regardless of her aching back and legs,
    The clients were all lustful ghosts,
    Insulting her in every way like animals,
    Speaking of the madam, she was even more hateful,
    With a wolf's liver and a dog's lungs, her heart was completely black,
    It would be fine if she earned a lot of money,
    But if she earned less, she would glare,
    The money the girls earned with their blood and flesh,
    Was used to provide for her food, drink, and opium addiction,
    She had to respectfully offer her hot ginseng soup with both hands,
    But she would either complain that it was too hot or too cold,
    Splashing the hot soup on you,
    Twisting you until your whole body turned blue,
    When she had energy from smoking opium,
    She would soak the leather whip in water and lash you until the pain pierced your heart,
    Before long, she contracted syphilis,
    The pain of this disease was even deeper,
    With no choice, she gritted her teeth and sought a way to die,
    But the madam was suspicious and never left her side,
    Making it so you couldn't die even if you wanted to,
    And you couldn't live even if you wanted to.
    Gui Zhen's suffering was endless,
    Jinhua's pain was also indescribable,
    The two sisters lived like this for more than half a year,
    When suddenly a thunderclap sounded in hell,
    The sisters secretly spread the news,
    Saying that the People's Liberation Army was coming,
    The troops were only eighty *li* away from the city,
    And would soon arrive in Zhangjiakou City.
    The madam hurriedly spread rumors,
    "Saying, 'Listen carefully, girls,
    The Liberation Army kills people without batting an eye,
    They hate us prostitutes the most,
    Saying we are all parasites,
    All useless people in society,
    If you are caught by the Liberation Army,
    There's no way you'll survive.'"
    She also said that the Liberation Army wouldn't be able to come,
    Because there was Chiang Kai-shek's direct "Central Army" here.
    As they were talking, the cannons roared,
    The Liberation Army attacked Zhangjiakou City,
    Everyone said the Liberation Army was coming too fast,
    The madam was worried and wanted to take the girls out of the city,
    But who knew that the Liberation Army had surrounded the city,
    And the streets were under curfew, so they couldn't pass,
    In the meantime, the "Central Army" troops surrendered,
    And the Liberation Army entered Zhangjiakou City.
    The Liberation Army's discipline was truly good,
    Treating the common people like family,
    Speaking kindly and with rules,
    The people of the whole city rejoiced,
    The madam was still afraid it wasn't safe,
    So she fabricated rumors out of thin air again,
    The madam said: "The Liberation Army is sweet at first but bitter later,
    If we get arrested, we won't survive."
    This Sun madam was still so fierce and hateful,
    Still forcing Gui Zhen and Jinhua to receive guests,
    Still being beaten and scolded every day,
    Still living in hell.
    This matter alarmed Chairman Mao,
    The great savior of the Chinese people,
    Chairman Mao has been leading the revolution since 1921,
    And his goal is to liberate the suffering brothers and sisters,
    To destroy the dark feudal system of the old society,
    To build a new China where everyone enjoys freedom, equality, and peace,
    Now that Zhangjiakou City has been liberated,
    How can the sisters still be suffering in the fire pit?!
    An order was sent to Zhangjiakou City,
    And all the people in the city cheered and agreed,
    The people's police were all mobilized,
    To gather the people from the brothels and other places for training.
    The Sun madam panicked upon hearing this,
    But just as she wanted to escape, the police and staff arrived,
    When the Sun madam saw that the situation was bad,
    She was afraid that the girls would accuse and struggle against her,
    So she secretly spread rumors,
    Telling lies to scare people,
    Saying that this gathering was terrible,
    And that we were all going to die,
    She also said that we would be sent to the Northeast as soldiers,
    Or that we would be matched up with disabled people.
    The sisters had never seen the world and couldn't tell right from wrong,
    So they believed the madam's rumors to be true,
    Crying and making a fuss,
    Even when the staff explained to them, they wouldn't listen,
    Some said, "I don't want to be liberated,
    I'd rather be a prostitute, you should leave us alone!"
    Jinhua and Gui Zhen were also afraid,
    So the two of them came up with an idea,
    Taking advantage of the chaos that night,
    The two sisters jumped over the wall and ran away.
    The two of them escaped into a small alley,
    Jinhua said: "Sister, wait for me here by the corner of the wall,
    I'll go over there and buy some sesame cakes to take with us,
    So we sisters can travel day and night,
    We sisters will escape to Shijiazhuang,
    And then try to find a way to make a living."
    Saying that, she went to the street corner to buy sesame cakes,
    Gui Zhen hid at the corner of the wall, frightened,
    Just as Jinhua reached the street corner to buy sesame cakes,
    Suddenly, a policeman came up from behind,
    Grabbed Jinhua's hand,
    And said: "Why haven't you gone for training yet?"
    Jinhua cried and struggled to escape,
    When suddenly another person flashed out from the side,
    To know what happened next,
    Listen to the explanation in the next episode.
               Episode Six: Liberation
    It was said that the two sisters believed the rumors,
    And ran away in the dark of night,
    Jinhua was just about to buy sesame cakes,
    When suddenly a person flashed out,
    Two people's police officers persuaded and pulled,
    To take Jinhua to be trained,
    In an instant, Jinhua was taken away,
    This Gui Zhen under the corner of the wall was anxious and didn't dare to hum,
    Helplessly, she had to escape alone,
    And went out of the city along the alley,
    Begging for food along the way,
    She escaped to Shijiazhuang City in seven days,
    She had no relatives and no relatives,
    So she had to live by begging.
    One day, while begging for food, she came to a household,
    And a couple came out,
    The man was fat like a pig,
    The woman was thin and long like a stick,
    The two of them were dressed very luxuriously,
    And looked like wealthy people.
    Gui Zhen hurried forward to beg for money,
    The two of them looked Gui Zhen up and down,
    The man said: "I see that your accent is not right,
    You must be a foreigner."
    The woman said: "Do you have any relatives in this city?
    Do you have a husband, children, or anyone to rely on?"
    Gui Zhen was afraid to tell the truth and lose face,
    And afraid that these two people were not good people,
    So she said: "My home is in Zhangjiakou,
    My family is a businessman,
    But because the Liberation Army came,
    My father and I escaped from home,
    My father died of illness halfway,
    Leaving me alone,
    I have no relatives or anyone to rely on in this city,
    So I have to live by begging,
    Two gentlemen, please be kind,
    Give me some money to save my life."
    The man kept saying: "So unlucky".
    The woman busily said: "What a pitiful person".
    The woman said: "Come to my house to wash clothes every day,
    I'll make sure you're fed and not cold,
    Gui Zhen was very grateful to hear this,
    And kept calling the woman her benefactor.
    From then on, she washed clothes for the woman's family every day,
    And didn't have to worry about three meals a day,
    Another month passed,
    And it was still peaceful.
    One day, Gui Zhen was washing clothes,
    The woman came over and asked,
    Asking Gui Zhen: "Where do you live at night?
    Where do you settle down?"
    Gui Zhen said: "I don't have a fixed place to settle down,
    I often settle down in broken temples or under eaves."
    The woman sighed and said: "You're so pitiful,
    A pitiful and lonely foreigner."
    She told Gui Zhen to move into her house,
    To settle down in the small room next to the kitchen,
    Gui Zhen thanked her upon hearing this,
    And called her the lady her great benefactor.
    Two more months passed,
    And the lady took care of Gui Zhen in every way,
    One day, she called Gui Zhen to the main room,
    The lady sat on the sofa and asked,
    She asked Gui Zhen for an hour or two,
    But Gui Zhen still didn't tell the truth because she was afraid of losing face,
    The lady listened to Gui Zhen's words,
    As if she believed every word,
    Listening to the words and saying that she was pitiful,
    Every word she said expressed sympathy,
    She said: "I see that you are a good girl,
    And you are honest and diligent,
    Smart, and skillful,
    And your mouth is sweet and endearing,
    My husband and I have been married for twenty years,
    And we haven't had any children in our forties,
    I want to adopt you as my own daughter,
    I don't know if you agree or not?"
    Gui Zhen felt a cold shiver upon hearing this,
    She felt sad when she thought about these things,
    She had been a daughter to people several times,
    But in the end, she was sold into a fire pit,
    She busily said: "Thank you for thinking so highly of me, madam,
    Gui Zhen thanks you for your kindness,
    But because Gui Zhen was born with a bad life,
    I dare not try to climb up to rich people."
    The lady persuaded her from the side,
    But Gui Zhen just wouldn't agree,
    The lady said: "If you don't want to, then forget it,"
    She didn't get angry at all.
    Another half a month passed,
    And the lady brought up this matter to Gui Zhen again,
    Gui Zhen thought: "This person is indeed kind-hearted,
    Not like those bad people in the past.
    Gui Zhen agreed wholeheartedly,
    And the lady and master both smiled,
    They kowtowed and worshipped on the spot,
    And hurriedly ordered her to change her clothes,
    To take a bath, perm her hair, and put on clothes,
    Completely turning into two different people,
    You see, she lightly smeared a layer of powder on her face,
    And put on vermilion rouge on her lips,
    Her eyebrows were curved, thin, and long,
    And her crystal clear eyes were even more moving,
    Her permed hair was black and shiny,
    Her short-sleeved cheongsam was fashionable,
    Her legs were covered with flesh-colored stockings,
    And she wore high-heeled leather shoes on her feet.
    She also hired a tutor for her,
    To teach her how to sing and play the piano,
    To teach her how to play cards and dance,
    And told her many romantic stories,
    Teaching her how to say flirtatious words,
    Teaching her how to be charming when receiving guests,
    Saying that this was all learning how to be a young lady,
    And that she would seem shabby if she didn't learn to act like a young lady,
    She learned to interact in social situations,
    And often went to the theater and movies.
    In just over half a year,
    Gui Zhen became famous in Shijiazhuang,
    Attracting many frivolous noble sons,
    Who wrote her many love letters,
    Attracting many high-ranking officials and dignitaries,
    Who often came to visit her father's home.

    烟花女儿翻身记
    献给妇女生产教养院的姐妹们
    （续第卅一期，一月八日）
           第五回  落水
    却说孙领家正要把桂贞打，
    门外走进来了老妖精，
    说声大爷你歇歇手，
    她乍到这里不懂情，
    等我慢慢把她劝解，
    慢慢的叫她归顺爷们，
    要是她还不听我的劝，
    再任你剥皮任你抽筋。”
    领家说“也罢，我看在了你的面上，
    容你半点钟回我的信，
    要是你说话她不听，
    我定要剥皮定要抽筋”。
    说罢冲冲出去了，
    老妖精一旁把话明，
    未开言先是一阵哈哈笑，
    叫了声“桂贞你是听，
    我看你真是个乡下姑娘，
    把这些事情看的太认真，
    常言说万般的事情皆由命，
    命中注定不由人，
    阎王注定你该死你不得活，
    阎王不勾命你想死也死不成，
    你前生一定是个坏嫖客，
    这世才投胎了窑姐的人，
    命里怎么该你就怎么受，
    何必惹得领家把气生，
    你昨儿夜里也落了水，
    何必还装那些假正经，
    劝你早顺从了，皮肉就少受痛苦，
    今世受苦，来世一定投胎个有钱人。”
    花言巧语一席话，
    迷信的桂贞她就信了个真，
    心想我桂贞真命苦，
    八岁上死了亲母亲，
    后母娘待我太刻薄，
    爹爹也把我不当人，
    只说逃出来独自生活，
    德强被“中央军”又抓了兵，
    姐妹二人当女招待，
    如今又落在了这陷人坑，
    上次我觅死吊了颈，
    被人救活又没有死成，
    看起来准是命中注定，
    前生的冤债缠住了身，
    她说“也罢，算我桂贞认了命，
    我任人糟蹋任人折腾，”
    老妖精一听哈哈笑，
    “桂贞，我说你真是个聪明人！”
    可怜清白的小桂贞，
    从此就做了卖淫的人。
    第三天她遇见了金花姐，
    才知道金花和她一样落陷坑，
    姐妹俩本想一块把苦诉，
    领家一旁瞪眼把眉横，
    吓得姐妹二人直发抖，
    再没敢说话啃一声。
    世人都说黄连苦，
    桂贞比黄连苦十分，
    每天打扮成鬼样儿，
    供那些有钱的爷们来开心，
    白天“开盘”又“卖铺”，
    晚上陪客人到天明，
    成天“做事由”二、三十个，
    不管腰酸与腿疼，
    嫖客都是些色情鬼，
    百般的侮辱像畜牲，
    提起领家更可恨，
    狼肝狗肺黑透了心，
    赚钱多了还则罢，
    赚钱少了瞪眼睛，
    姑娘们血肉挣的钱，
    供她吃喝过烟瘾，
    热好参汤双手敬，
    不是嫌热就嫌冷，
    热汤拨在了你的身上，
    拧得你周身全发青，
    吸烟吸的有了劲，
    皮鞭沾水抽的痛钻心，
    不久就沾上了梅毒病，
    这毒病染身苦更深，
    无奈何咬咬牙寻死路，
    领家多心她不离身，
    叫你想死死不了，
    叫你要活又活不成。
    桂贞的苦处说不完，
    金花的苦痛也说不清，
    姐妹俩混了半年多，
    地狱里突然响雷声，
    姐妹们暗暗的传消息，
    说过来了人民解放军，
    队伍离城只有八十里，
    快要来到这张家口城。
    领家急忙把谣言造，
    “叫了声姑娘们仔细听，
    解放军杀人不眨眼，
    最恨咱们这些妓女们，
    说咱们都是寄生虫，
    都是社会的无用之人，
    要是被解放军抓了去，
    要想活命万万不能。”
    又说解放军来不了，
    这里有蒋介石嫡系的“中央军”。
    说着说着大炮响，
    解放军攻打这张家口城，
    都说解放军来的怎么这样快，
    领家着急，要带着姑娘们逃出城，
    谁知解放军把城团团围困，
    街上戒严不能通行，
    说话之间“中央军”的队伍投了降，
    解放军进了这张家口城。
    解放军的纪律实在好，
    对待老百姓如一家人，
    说话和气又有规矩，
    全城的人民齐欢腾，
    领家的还怕不保险，
    凭空里又把那谣言生，
    领家说：“解放军是先甜而后苦，
    要抓去咱们可就活不成。”
    这孙领家还是那样凶恨，
    还逼的叫桂贞金花接客人，
    成天还是遭打骂，
    还是在地狱里过光阴。
    这事情惊动了毛主席，
    这位中国人民的大救星，
    毛主席自从一九二一年领导闹革命，
    就是要解救受苦受难的兄弟姐妹们，
    旧社会封建黑暗制度要摧毁，
    建设新中国，人人自由平等享太平，
    如今张家口城解放了，
    姐妹们还在火坑受难怎能行？！
    一道命令传到了这张家口，
    全城的老百姓都欢呼赞成，
    人民警察齐出动，
    来集中这妓院的人等去受训。
    孙领家一听心慌了，
    要想逃跑这警察与工作人员已来临，
    孙领家一见势不好，
    怕姑娘们向她诉苦来斗争，
    暗中就把那谣言造，
    扯谎说白来吓唬人，
    说这次集中可不得了，
    这一下咱们都要活不成，
    又说要充军到关外，
    又说要配给残废人。
    姐妹们没见过世面分不开是与非，
    领家的谣言她们信了个真，
    又是哭来又是闹，
    工作人员给她们解释她们也不听，
    有的说“我不愿意得解放，
    我还愿当妓女，你们休管这闲事情！”
    金花桂贞也心害怕，
    二人就把那主意生，
    趁着当天晚上人混乱，
    姐妹俩跳墙逃跑向外奔。
    二人逃到了小巷里，
    金花说：“妹妹你在这墙角等一等，
    我到那边去买点烧饼带上，
    咱姐妹好连夜连晚赶路程，
    咱姐妹逃到那石家庄去，
    再想方设法谋活命。”
    说着到街口上买烧饼，
    桂贞躲在墙角胆战惊，
    只见金花刚走到街口买烧饼，
    突然背后来了警察一个人，
    一把抓住了金花的手，
    说：“怎么你还没有去受训？”
    金花哭着挣扎要跑脱，
    一旁又闪出了一个人，
    要知道以后怎么样，
    且听下回说分明。
               第六回  解放
    却说她姐儿俩听信了谣言，
    黑夜里逃跑把路奔，
    金花正要买烧饼，
    突然闪过来一个人，
    两位人民警察一边劝说一边拉，
    要带金花去受训，
    霎时金花被带走了，
    这桂贞墙角下着急又不敢哼，
    没奈何只好一个人逃走，
    顺着小巷出了城，
    沿路讨吃要的走，
    七天逃到了石家庄城，
    举目无亲又无戚，
    只好乞食过光阴。
    有天讨吃来到一个住家户，
    里面出来了夫妇两个人，
    这男的肥胖像一口猪，
    这女的瘦长像一根棍，
    两个人穿的很阔气，
    很像个老财有钱的人。
    桂贞忙上前把钱讨，
    二人把桂贞浑身上下打量了个清，
    这男的说：“我看你说话口音不对，
    定是一个外乡人。”
    女的说：“你这城里有没有亲戚？
    有没有丈夫子女依靠的人？”
    桂贞怕说了实话丢脸面，
    又怕这二人不是好人，
    说：“我家住在张家口，
    家里是个买卖人，
    只因来了解放军，
    同我父亲逃出门，
    半途父亲得病死，
    丢下我一人孤零零，
    这城里无亲无依靠，
    只好讨吃过光阴，
    二位先生行行好，
    给点票子救救命”。
    男的连说：“真命苦”。
    女的忙说：“是可怜人”。
    女的说“你天天到我家里洗衣服，
    我管你吃饱不受冷，
    桂贞听说千恩万谢，
    连忙叫女的是大恩人。
    从此天天给这女的家里洗衣服，
    这一天三餐不耽心，
    日子又过了一个月，
    总算过得还清静。
    有一天桂贞正在洗衣服，
    这女的过来把话问，
    问桂贞：“晚上在那里住？
    什么地方来安身？”
    桂贞说：“安身地方没一定，
    破庙里房檐下常安身”。
    女人叹了口气说：“你真可怜，
    可怜孤苦的异乡人。”
    叫桂贞搬到她房子来住，
    火房旁边小屋里来安身，
    桂贞听罢忙道谢，
    口叫太太大恩人。
    日子又过了两个月，
    那太太处处都关照桂贞，
    有一天把桂贞叫到了上房里，
    太太坐在沙发上把话问，
    给桂贞拉扯了一两点钟，
    桂贞仍没吐真言怕丢人，
    那太太把桂贞话听了，
    好像她句句都信以为真，
    一边听话一边说可怜，
    她句句话儿都表同情，
    她说：“我看你是个良家女，
    人又老实又勤谨，
    聪明玲琍手又巧，
    嘴巴又甜惹人亲，
    我和我丈夫结婚了二十年，
    四十几岁没有把儿女生，
    有心收你作亲生女，
    不知你答应不答应？”
    桂贞一听打了个冷战，
    想起这些事就伤心，
    好几次给人当女儿，
    结果是被人卖身落火坑，
    忙说：“感谢太太抬举我，
    桂贞感谢太太的恩，
    只因桂贞生来命薄，
    不敢有心攀贵人。”
    太太一旁又解劝，
    桂贞只是不答应，
    太太说：“你不愿意也就算了，”
    一点也没有把气生。
    日子又过了半个月，
    太太向桂贞又提起这事情，
    桂贞想：“这人的确心眼好，
    可不像过去那些坏人。
    桂贞就满口答应了，
    太太老爷都笑盈盈，
    当时叩头拜过了，
    忙吩咐给她换换身，
    洗澡烫发穿衣服，
    完全变成了两样的人，
    你看她脸上薄薄的抹上了一层粉，
    朱红的胭脂点嘴唇，
    眉毛弯弯细而长，
    水晶晶的眼睛更动人，
    电烫的头发乌黑亮，
    短袖的旗袍样子时兴，
    腿上套着肉色的丝光袜，
    高跟的皮鞋脚下登。
    又给她请来了个家庭教师，
    教她唱歌教她弹琴，
    教她打牌跳交际舞，
    讲给她许多风流故事听，
    教她会说些风流话，
    教她接待宾客如何媚人，
    说这都是学着当小姐，
    不学些小姐样子就显得寒伧，
    交际场合她学着来往，
    常去看戏看电影。
    日子不过才半年多，
    桂贞在石家庄可出了名，
    惹得了许多轻薄的官贵子，
    写来了许多恋爱信，
    惹得了许多达官与尊贵，
    常到她父亲家里来串门。
