    Don't Give Nicknames to Characters!
    A teacher comrade never prepared for class. I found this very strange. Once, when discussing work experience with him, he said, "Why bother preparing a lesson for mere children? If there are characters they don't know, I just have the students look them up during class, and that solves the problem." I asked him, "What if the students ask you first?" He replied, "That's simple, I just tell them: Isn't it self-study guidance now? Look it up in the dictionary yourselves; you'll remember it better that way. Don't rely solely on the teacher." He then shared a little story about his teaching: Last semester, while teaching the second volume of history in senior primary school, when it came to the last lesson, which was probably about the Xi'an Incident, there was a phrase, "rú huǒ rú tú (如火如荼)." I didn't see it clearly and read it to the students as "rú huǒ rú 'chá' (如火如茶)." The students immediately pointed out, "Teacher, it's not 'chá (茶),' there's an extra stroke compared to the character 'chá!'" I looked, and sure enough, the bottom of 'chá (茶)' is '木 (mù, wood),' but the bottom of this character is '禾 (hé, grain).' After discovering the mistake, I immediately told the students to look it up in the dictionary. Later, after figuring it out, I was afraid of losing face and lowering my prestige, so I explained to the students, "It's not that I read it wrong, it's that this character has two pronunciations. My teacher taught me to pronounce it 'chá' when I was in school." And that's how I got away with it. This is this teacher's "experience" in solving unfamiliar characters without preparing lessons.
    Not preparing before class, clutching at straws during class, pretending to know when you don't—this teaching method is extremely dishonest and irresponsible. It's not a working attitude that a people's teacher should have. Raising it to the level of principle, it's like eating the people's millet for nothing.
    In addition, it is also common to see some teachers who do not recognize the characters, nor do they look them up in the dictionary, such as pronouncing the "kù (酷)" in "cruel (残酷)" as "hào (皓)," pronouncing the "zhuó (濯)" in "wash (洗濯)" as "zhái (翟)" or "yào (耀)," pronouncing the "quān (悛)" in "unrepentant (怙恶不悛)" as "jùn (俊)," pronouncing "dàn shēng (诞生, birth)" as "yán shēng (延生)" and so on. These teachers are mostly careless and do not seek thorough understanding. I hope these teachers will look up more dictionaries and ask more people in the future, and don't give characters nicknames, especially teachers, you should pay special attention! Otherwise, you will "mislead the children."

    不要给字起外号！
    一位教员同志，上课从来不准备，我觉得很奇怪，有一次和他谈工作经验，他说：“教个毛孩子还用准备课，不认识的字，上了课叫学生先查查，就解决了问题。”我问他：“如果学生先问你呢？”他道：“那很简单，就给学生说：现在实行自学辅导吗？自己查字典，记的牢，不要光依靠老师。”接着又给我介绍他教书上的一段小故事：上学期担任高小二册历史，讲到了末了一课，大概是西安事变，里面有一句是如火如荼，我没看清，给学生念成了如火如“茶”，学生们当时就给我提出了意见：“老师，不是茶，比茶字还多一道呢！”我一看，可不是，茶字下面是木字，这个字下面是禾字，发见了错误，马上叫学生查字典，后来才弄清楚，又怕丢了自己人，降低了自己威信，随给学生解释：“不是我念错了，是这个字有两个音，我在学校时老师就教我念茶。”就这样混过去了。这就是这位教员不准备功课解决生字的“经验”。
    课前不准备，上课抱佛脚，强不知以为知，这种教学方法，是极不老实，极不负责任的表现，不是一个人民教师应有的工作态度，提到原则上来讲，就是白吃人民的小米。
    另外也常见到一些教员，对字认不清，也不查字典，如把残酷的酷念成“皓”，把洗濯的濯字念成“翟”或“耀”，把怙恶不悛的悛念成“俊”，把诞生念成延生等等，这些教员，大部是粗枝大叶，不求甚解，我希望这些教员们以后要多查字典多问人，不要给字起外号，尤其是教员，更应特别留意！否则便要“误人子弟”。
