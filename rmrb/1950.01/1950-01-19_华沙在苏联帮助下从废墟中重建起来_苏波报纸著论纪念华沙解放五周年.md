Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 18th: January 17th marked the fifth anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Warsaw, the Polish capital. Newspapers in both the Soviet Union and Poland have published articles discussing the glorious achievements of the Polish people, who, with Soviet assistance, rebuilt Warsaw from ruins in just five short years.

    A reporter for Izvestia wrote an interview with Piotrkowski, Acting Minister of Construction of Poland. Piotrkowski stated: "On January 17, 1945, the Soviet Army, together with the Polish Army, liberated Warsaw. At that time, Warsaw was a dead city that had suffered complete destruction. Reconstruction began immediately afterwards. The Soviet Union gave us fraternal assistance, shipping grain from Moscow to supply the residents of Warsaw. A team of Soviet experts drafted a plan for the reconstruction of Warsaw. Thanks to Soviet assistance, power plants, water plants, and gas plants began construction. Under the personal direction of Marshal Stalin, five hundred temporary houses were sent to the builders of the Polish capital. In the five years since liberation, Warsaw has been transformed from a dead city into the vibrant political, cultural, economic, and social center of the new Poland."

    The Warsaw newspaper wrote: "Five years ago, the destruction suffered by Warsaw seemed impossible to repair for an entire generation."

    "At that time, Warsaw was a field of rubble. However, today we are walking on the vibrant streets of the capital." The newspaper stated: "In the Six-Year Plan, Warsaw will build an additional 12 million cubic meters of housing, providing housing for 200,000 new residents. New workers' residential areas and factories will also be built, and construction of high-speed urban railways will begin."

    华沙在苏联帮助下从废墟中重建起来
    苏波报纸著论纪念华沙解放五周年
    【新华社北京十八日电】一月十七日，是苏军解放波兰首都华沙的五周年纪念日，苏波两国报纸都论述波兰人民在苏联的帮助下，在短短的五年期间就把华沙从废墟中重建起来的光辉成就。
    消息报记者撰写波兰建设部代理部长彼奥特罗夫斯基的访问记，彼氏称：一九四五年一月十七日，苏军会同波军部队解放了华沙，当时，华沙是一座遭受了彻底破坏的死城，随后，便立刻着手重建。苏联给我们兄弟般的帮助，从莫斯科运来了供给华沙居民的粮食。苏联专家工作队草拟了重建华沙的计划。由于苏联的帮助，电力厂、自来水厂与瓦斯厂都动工建造了。在斯大林大元帅的亲自指示下，送来了五百所活动房子给波兰首都的建设者。自从解放以来的五年中，华沙已经从一座死城变成新波兰的生气勃勃的政治、文化、经济与社会中心。
    华沙报写道：五年以前，华沙所受的破坏，似乎整整一个世代都无法弥补起来。
    当时的华沙，可说是一个瓦砾之场。然而，今天我们却在生气勃勃的首都街道上行走了。该报称：在六年计划中，华沙还要建筑一千二百万立方公尺的住屋，供二十万新居民居住，新的工人住宅区和制造厂也将建立起来，并将开始建筑高速度的城市铁路。
