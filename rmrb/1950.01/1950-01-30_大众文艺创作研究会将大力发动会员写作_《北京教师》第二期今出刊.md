Six Mass Literature Weekly Lectures were held. In addition, the extensive masses were connected through the broadcasting of new Quyi, uniting a group of artists. In terms of creation, 84 new Quyi pieces have been rewritten and created from old Quyi, and workers and factory literary workers have also created 50 kinds of scripts. In terms of editing and publishing, in addition to hosting five supplements in the Beijing Xinmin Daily (New Quyi, New Music, New Art, New Beijing, Factory Literature) and hosting a Mass Literature supplement in the Tianjin Daily, a regular publication, the Mass Literature Newsletter, will soon be issued, and several new Quyi series and the "Sing and Speak" monthly magazine have also been published. Regarding the work for 1950, the meeting decided to rectify old members, develop new members, strengthen research work, combine new situations and new tasks to mobilize members to write, and call on members to create 150 new Quyi pieces, one drum ballad book, one long Pinghua (storytelling) novel, and 24 scripts in 1950.
