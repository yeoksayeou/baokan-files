    The Soviet Middle School Teaching Program
    Ivanov
    The Soviet middle school teaching program is a document approved by the Soviet government, which includes the following items:
    1.  Formulating a curriculum; 2. Stipulating the order of subject study for each grade; 3. Specifying the time allotted for each subject during the teaching period (one year and one week); 4. Stipulating the academic year schedule.
    The basic principle for selecting subjects in the Soviet middle school teaching program is that the cultivation and education of young people should be subordinate to the task of striving for the victory of communism. To meet this great historical task, young people should master all the knowledge accumulated by mankind. However, this knowledge is vast and all-encompassing. No one can fully master all of this knowledge, even if they dedicate their entire life to this cause. Therefore, the Soviet middle school teaching program only includes the basic elements of all scientific knowledge achievements that are indispensable for each educated person.
    Modern advanced science regards various phenomena in the world as the movement of various substances. The regularity of these forms of movement is the object of study for physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, and other subjects. The object of study for social sciences is the law of the development of human society.
    Neither chemistry nor biology can express their own thoughts. Humans are thinking beings, so the law of development of human thinking is the object of study for psychology and logic.
    The task of Soviet middle schools is not only to impart scientific knowledge. Because humans are active beings, and because humans acquire knowledge in order to actively engage in activities in the world and transform the world to meet human interests, one of the main tasks of Soviet schools is to cultivate students' labor habits.
    Cultivating students' intellectual labor habits—that is, studying books, observing phenomena, studying phenomena, etc.—is the task of universal education. These habits should be systematically cultivated in students throughout the teaching of all subjects.
    The task of universal education also includes teaching students the common sense of medical care, hygiene habits, and sports habits that humans have studied for hundreds of years. These subjects are all included in the Soviet middle school teaching program.
    Art is a tool for understanding the world and transforming the world. It has a powerful influence on mankind and makes mankind noble. Soviet schools cultivate students' love of art, teach them to understand art, and teach them to basically understand those arts that are most easily accepted and widely disseminated (such as painting, sculpture, drawing, singing, etc.).
    Therefore, the following subjects are included in the Soviet middle school teaching program:
    I. Natural Sciences
    ① Mathematics;
    ② Physics;
    ③ Astronomy;
    ④ Chemistry;
    ⑤ Part of Geology and Mineralogy;
    ⑥ Natural Geography;
    ⑦ Natural Common Sense.
    II. Social Sciences and various other arts
    ① History;
    ② Part of Constitution and Jurisprudence;
    ③ Economic Geography;
    ④ Russian (native language);
    ⑤ Literature;
    ⑥ Foreign Language;
    ⑦ Physical Education;
    ⑧ Calligraphy;
    ⑨ Drawing;
    ⑩ Painting and Sculpture;
    ⑾ Singing.
    III. Sciences of Thinking
    ① Psychology;
    ② Logic.
    The various subjects mentioned above are the subjects that every modern educated person, a well-rounded person, must know. Not understanding one of these subjects would be a fundamental defect in the student's universal education.
    Of course, it goes without saying that only the foundations of science can be laid in Soviet universal education schools, that is, only the basic scientific propositions that are easy for children of a certain age to understand and at the same time ensure a correct understanding of the laws of natural development, the laws of human social development, and the laws of thinking development can be explained. The principles of this or that science studied in the school are called subjects.
    Of course, not all subjects can be carried out at the same time, nor can they be studied throughout the entire teaching period of middle school. The allocation of subjects in each grade of Soviet middle schools is based on the age of the students, and especially on the general development level of students' previous education and the needs of logic. Elementary classes only study a few subjects that serve as the foundation for future learning. New subjects are gradually added according to the students' mastery of the necessary knowledge and habits.
    The average number of school days per year in Soviet middle schools is 213, with a total of 230 days including test days and exam days. Due to the different endings of the academic year, the holidays for each class are also different, ranging from about 36 days to 40 days.
    Soviet schools have three vacations a year: winter vacation (10 days), spring vacation (5 days), and summer vacation, which is after the exams and lasts for two to three months.
    The total study time per year is 9,547 hours, and the time allocated to each subject is very different. This allocation is based on many conditions: that is, according to the importance of the subject in education and cultivation, the scale of the course, that is, on what scale the subject is studied, and the importance of the subject to the study of other subjects.
    Based on the above characteristics, Russian (native language) and literature rank first. These two subjects account for 30% of the study time. In addition, all schools in the Soviet Union study foreign languages. Together with Russian and literature, there are a total of 3,791 hours, which is 39% of the total study time.
    Mathematics ranks second, with a total of 2,092 hours, which is 22% of the total study time.
    Russian (native language), literature, and mathematics are studied in all ten academic years. Natural Common Sense, History, and Geography are studied from the fourth grade. According to the teaching plan, the annual time for Natural Common Sense and History and Geography is as follows: Natural Common Sense—458 hours, History—700 hours, Geography—537 hours. The Soviet Constitution is only studied in the seventh grade, and the time is 65 hours. Physics is studied from the sixth grade to the tenth grade, and the time is 472 hours. Chemistry is studied from the seventh grade to the tenth grade, and the time is 343 hours. Astronomy is only studied in the tenth grade, with a total of 33 hours in one year. Physical education courses are conducted in all ten grades, with 557 hours per year. Painting is studied from the first grade to the fifth grade, one hour per week. Drawing is studied from the sixth grade to the tenth grade, one hour per week. Singing is from the first grade to the fourth grade, one hour per week.
    The entire teaching experience of Soviet teachers proves that the completion of the Soviet middle school universal education teaching program guarantees that students have profound and solid knowledge in natural science and social science; it guarantees that students can correctly, scientifically, and materialistically understand the development of nature, the development of society, and the development of thinking. The young men and women who graduate from Soviet middle schools are highly educated people who can immediately actively participate in all aspects of Soviet economic and social life after graduating from school and become builders of communist society. At the same time, those who graduate from middle school can also be well prepared to enter various universities and continue their studies.

    苏联中等学校的教学计划
    伊凡诺夫
    苏联中等学校的教学计划是苏联政府所批准的文件，其中包括如下事项：
    一、制订课程表；二、规定各年级的学科研究顺序；三、规定在教学期间（一年和一周）内每个学科进行的时间；四、规定学年日程表。
    苏联中等学校教学计划选择学科的基本原则，就是对青年所进行的培养和教育工作应该服从于争取共产主义胜利的任务。为要符合这个伟大历史任务，青年们应当掌握人类所积累的一切知识。但是这些知识包罗很广。任何一个人甚至把自己一生都贡献给这个事业，但也不能全部精通这些知识。因此，苏联中等学校教学计划只把一切科学知识成就中间对每个受教育者必不可缺少的基本东西包括在内。
    近代先进科学把世界上的各种现象看作是各种物质的运动。这些运动形式的规律性，就是物理、数学、化学、生物学以及其他学科的研究对象。而社会科学的研究对象则是人类社会的发展规律。
    无论是化学和生物学都不能表现自己的思想。人则是能思考的生物，所以人类思考的发展规律就是心理学和逻辑学的研究对象。
    苏联中等学校的任务不仅在于传达科学知识。由于人是从事活动的生物，由于人类之获得知识是为了在世界上积极从事活动并把世界改造成符合人类的利益，所以，苏联各学校的主要任务之一就是培养学生们的劳动习惯。
    培养学生的智力劳动习惯——即钻研书籍，观察现象和研究现象以及其他等——都是普及教育的任务。在一切学科的讲授过程中使学生们有系统地养成这些习惯。
    普及教育任务也包括向学生讲授人类几百年来所研究的医务常识、卫生习惯以及体育习惯等。这些学科都包括在苏联中等学校的教学计划里面。
    艺术是了解世界和改造世界的一个工具。它对人类具有强大的影响，并使人类变得高尚。苏联各学校培养学生们爱好艺术，教导他们去了解艺术，以及教导他们基本上了解那些最易接受而又非常广泛传布的艺术（如绘画、造型艺术、制图、歌唱及其他等）。
    因此，在苏联中等学校的教学计划里面计有下列各种学科：
    一、自然科学
    ①数学；
    ②物理；
    ③天文学；
    ④化学；
    ⑤地质学及矿物学之一部；
    ⑥自然地理；
    ⑦自然常识。
    二、社会科学及其他各种艺术
    ①历史；
    ②宪法及法律学之一部；
    ③经济地理；
    ④俄语（本国语）；
    ⑤文学；
    ⑥外国语；
    ⑦体育；
    ⑧书法；
    ⑨制图；
    ⑩绘画和造型艺术；
    ⑾唱歌。
    三、思维科学
    ①心理学；
    ②逻辑学。
    上面所说的各种学科都是现代每个有教养者、全面发展的人必须知道的学科。对其中某一科若是不了解，那就是对学生普及教育上的根本缺陷。
    当然，不言而喻，在苏联的普及教育学校里面只能奠定科学基础，也就是说，只能讲解对一定年龄的儿童容易了解而同时保证能正确了解自然发展规律、人类社会发展规律和思维发展规律的科学的基本论题。学校中所研究的这一或那一科学的原理就叫做学科。
    当然，一切学科既不能同时进行，也不能在中学的全部教学时期内通统研究。苏联中学各年级的学科分配，是按照学生的年龄、而特别是按照学生以前受教育的一般发展水平和逻辑的需要来进行。初级班只学习不多几门作为将来学习基础的学科。新学科则按照学生所学的必须知识和习惯的掌握程度而逐渐增添。
    苏联中学的每年全部学习日平均为二百一十三日，与所举行的测验日和考试日算在一起共为二百三十日。由于学年终结的不同，各班的休假日也不同，大约自三十六日到四十日。
    苏联学校学生在一年内有三个假期：寒假（十日）、春假（五日）、暑假则是在考试完了之后而放假两月到三月。
    每年的全部学习时间是九千五百四十七小时，各学科所分配的时间极不一样。这种分配是根据下面的许多条件：即根据该学科在教育、培养方面的重要性，该课程的规模，也就是说在何种规模下研究该学科，以及该学科对研究其他学科的重要性。
    根据上述特点，俄语（本国语）和文学占第一位。这两门学科占学习时间百分之三十。此外，苏联各学校都学习外国语。与俄语和文学算在一起共为三千七百九十一小时，也就是说，占全部学习时间的百分之三十九。
    数学占第二位，共两千零九十二小时，也就是说占全部学习时间的百分之二十二。
    俄语（本国语）、文学和数学在十个学年内都进行学习。自然常识、历史和地理自四年级开始学习。根据教学计划，自然常识和史地的每年时间如下：自然常识——四百五十八小时，历史——七百小时，地理——五百三十七小时。苏联宪法只有七年级学习，时间是六十五小时。物理是从六年级到十年级学习，时间是四百七十二小时。化学是从七年级到十年级学习，时间是三百四十三小时。天文学只有第十年级学习，在一年内共三十三小时。体育课程则在十个年级内都进行，每年五百五十七小时。绘画是从一年级到五年级学习，每周一小时。制图是从六年级到十年级学习，每周一小时。唱歌是从一年级到四年级，每周一小时。
    苏联教师的全部教学经验证明，苏联中等学校普及教育教学计划之完成，则保证学生在自然科学和社会科学方面具有深刻牢固的知识；保证学生能正确地、科学地、唯物地了解自然发展、社会发展和思维的发展。自苏联中等学校毕业的男女青年们，都是有高度教养的人，他们能在学校毕业之后立即积极参加苏联经济生活和社会生活上的各方面工作，成为共产主义社会的建设者。同时，在中等学校毕业的人也能很好地准备考入各高等学校，继续深造。
