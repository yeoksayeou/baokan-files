    Keys and Doors
    Fang Hong
    Many comrades are very enthusiastic about learning, but whenever they encounter difficulties, they stop thinking and delving into the problem themselves, hoping only that a responsible comrade will give a report. It seems that after listening to a report, the problem can be completely solved immediately.
    Because of this attitude, two different results have emerged.
    One type of person, after listening to a report, no longer connects it with reality or studies it in depth, and believes that they understand and have solved the problem. Therefore, they are no longer willing to engage in personal or group study. At a training class in this city, there is a saying that "listening to reports solves major problems, and discussions solve trivial problems," which represents this kind of thinking.
    Another type of person, after listening to a report, also does not connect it with reality or study it in depth. The difference is that they feel the report has not solved the problem. Therefore, they simply lose interest in listening to reports at all. Thus, there is the saying, "Listening to hours of long reports, it's still the same old thing!"
    The ideological root of this attitude is laziness in learning, a failure to understand that learning mainly relies on individual effort; others can only help you learn, but cannot replace your learning. As one comrade said: listening to a report may give you a key, but how to use this key to open the door and enter the hall is your own business; others cannot carry you in.
    The former type of person, having obtained the key, believes that they have already entered the door, and therefore no longer exerts themselves. But in fact, they have not yet entered the door; and if they do not recognize this mistake, they will never be able to enter. The latter type of person, having obtained the key, knows that they have not yet entered the door, and complains that the key is ineffective, without knowing how to use the key to open the door. Thus, standing still, they will also be unable to enter the door.
    Only those who have a key and also strive to use the key to open the door can truly enter. Or, in other words, only those who have listened to a report and can then connect the report with reality and their own thoughts for in-depth thinking and research can truly solve the problem.

    钥匙和门
    方虹
    有许多同志，学习很积极，但是每每一遇困难，自己便不再思考钻研，只希望有负责同志来作一个报告。似乎一听报告，问题便可立刻完全解决了。
    由于这种态度，又产生了两种不同的结果。
    一种人听了报告以后，不再联系实际、深入研究，便自以为懂得了，解决问题了。因此不再愿意进行个人学习和小组学习。在本市一个讲习班上，有“听报告解决大问题，讨论解决琐碎问题”的说法，就代表这种思想。
    另外一种人听了报告以后，也是不联系实际、深入研究，所不同的是他们觉得报告并没解决问题。因此便索性连对听报告也不发生兴趣了。于是，便有“听几个钟点大报告，还不是老一套！”的说法。
    这种态度的思想根源是学习上的懒惰性，是由于不懂得学习主要要靠个人的努力；别人只能帮助你学习而不能代替你学习。正如一位同志说过：听报告可能给你一个钥匙，但怎样用这钥匙去打开大门而登堂入室，则是你自己的事，别人不能把你驮进去。
    前一种人拿到了钥匙，便以为已经入门了，因此自己便不再操劳。但是事实上他是还没有入门的；而且如果他自己不再认识这个错误的话，便将永远不得入门。后一种人拿到了钥匙，知道自己还没入门，便埋怨钥匙无灵，而不知道利用钥匙去开门。这样停步不前，也是进不了大门。
    只有有了钥匙，而又努力用钥匙去开门的人，才能够真正入门。或者说，只有听了报告，而又能将报告联系实际和自己思想来深入思考研究的人，才能够真正解决问题。
