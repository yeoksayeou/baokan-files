Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 1st: CPUSA General Secretary Dennis sent a letter to Chairman Mao Zedong, congratulating him on the great victory of the Chinese people. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Comrade Mao,

During our long months of trial, we have been inspired by the heartening achievements of the great Chinese people and their glorious vanguard—the Communist Party. We rejoice that our friend New China has frustrated the American imperialist rulers who, by fabricating charges against our party and its leaders, sought to undermine justice and thereby discredit them.

The victory of the Chinese people is not merely the liberation of four hundred and fifty million people from the shackles of ancient feudal reaction and foreign imperialism. The establishment of the People's Republic of China is of historic significance for the consolidation of the cause of world peace. It greatly strengthens the camp of peace, freedom, and socialism throughout the world. Therefore, it also makes many contributions to the struggle of the American people against the triple threat—economic crisis, fascism, and the suicidal war caused by Wall Street's desperate struggle to save the doomed social system of monopoly capital.

We know that the American imperialists, because their conspiracy to dominate the world has been thwarted by the forces of peace, socialism, and people's democracy led by the invincible Soviet Union, will intensify their attacks on our vanguard party and on all democratic and peace-loving elements in our country. As far as we and the people of the Marshallized countries are concerned, the greatest and hardest struggle is still ahead. But we remember the enormous difficulties that the camp of world peace and social progress has overcome—especially the glorious twenty-year struggle of the now victorious Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, your expression of international working-class solidarity is deeply respected and further increases our confidence in our party, in our working class, and in our people.

Strive for a peace and friendship treaty between the United States and China, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and France!

Long live the friendship between the American and Chinese people!

Long live the People's Republic of China and its Communist Party leaders!

Victory belongs to the camp of world peace, national liberation, and socialism!

Your comrade,
	General Secretary Eugene Dennis
	November 28, 1949

    美共总书记函毛主席
    祝贺新中国伟大胜利
    【新华社北京一日电】美国共产党总书记但尼斯致函毛泽东主席，祝贺我国人民的伟大胜利。该函全文如下：亲爱的毛同志：
    在我们漫长的几个月的审讯中，我们为伟大中国人民及其光荣的先锋队——共产党的令人振奋的成就所鼓舞。我们庆幸我们的朋友新中国挫败了以捏造的罪名控告我们党及其领袖，因而破坏正义的美国帝国主义统治者，并使他们信誉丧失。
    中国人民的胜利，不仅仅是四万万五千万人从古老的封建反动暴政和外国帝国主义的桎梏下获得解放。中华人民共和国的成立，对于世界和平事业的巩固具有历史的意义。它大大地加强了全世界和平、自由、社会主义的阵营。因此，它对于美国人民反对三重威胁——经济危机，法西斯主义及华尔街为了拯救垄断资本的注定了要灭亡的社会制度而绝望挣扎所造成的自杀战争——而进行的斗争也有许多贡献。
    我们知道，美国帝国主义者，由于其统治世界的阴谋为不可战胜的苏联领导下的和平、社会主义及人民民主主义力量所挫折，将会加紧他们对我们作为先锋的党以及对我国一切民主及爱好和平分子的进攻。就我们和就马歇尔化各国的人民而言，最大而最坚苦的斗争还在前头。但是我们记得世界和平与社会进步阵营所已克服的巨大困难——尤其记得现在已荣获胜利的光辉的中国共产党二十年的斗争。因此，你们关于国际工人阶级团结一致的表示，深深地得到敬重，并且更加提高我们对于我们党，对于我们工人阶级和我们人民的信心。
    争取美国与中国，苏联，大不列颠及法国间的和平友好公约！
    美中人民的友谊万岁！
    中华人民共和国及其共产党领袖们万岁！
    胜利归于全世界和平、民族解放及社会主义的阵营！
                        你的同志
                                总书记尤琴·但尼斯
                                一九四九年十一月二十八日
