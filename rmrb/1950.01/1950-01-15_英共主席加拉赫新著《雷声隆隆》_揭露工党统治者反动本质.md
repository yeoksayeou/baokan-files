Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th. According to TASS, Borisova commented on British Communist Party Chairman Gallacher's book "Rolling Thunder" in the Labour newspaper on the 8th, saying: In the fierce struggle between the forces of imperialism and reactionaries and the forces of democratic progress, the leaders of the British Labor Party acted as pawns of British and American imperialism, betraying the wishes of the working-class voters. The gap between them and the working masses is getting wider and wider. The book "Rolling Thunder" describes this process, which started long ago and intensified after the Second World War. The author uses the activities of the past two MacDonald cabinets to show the malignant development of the Labor Party rulers' reactionary policies, which are now the same as Churchill's. The book is rich in facts and analysis, and it will help readers to better understand the ongoing struggle between reactionary and progressive forces in Britain.

    英共主席加拉赫新著《雷声隆隆》
    揭露工党统治者反动本质
    【新华社北京十四日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：玻丽索娃在八日劳动报上撰文评论英国共产党主席加拉赫所著《雷声隆隆》一书称：在帝国主义和反动派力量与民主进步力量的残酷斗争中，英国工党领袖充当了英美帝国主义的走卒，背叛了工人阶级选民的愿望。他们与劳动群众之间的鸿沟越来越深。《雷声隆隆》一书所写的，就是这一早就开始、而在第二次大战后加紧了的过程。作者就过去两届麦克唐纳内阁的活动，来表明工党统治者现在与邱吉尔同出一辙的反动政策的恶性发展。书中有丰富的事实和分析，它将有助于读者更好地去了解英国反动力量与进步力量之间正在进行的斗争。
