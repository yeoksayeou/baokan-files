Drive Jiang Tingfu Out of the Security Council!
The People of the Capital Warmly Support Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement
And Thank the Soviet Union for Upholding Justice and Giving Support

[Reported by this newspaper] Workers, students, and staff of various organizations in the capital have continued to express warm support for Minister Zhou Enlai's telegram to the United Nations Security Council on January 8, demanding the expulsion of the illegal representatives of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang, and for the Soviet representative's first support of Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and firm advocacy of expelling the illegal representatives of the remnant bandits from the UN Security Council. Some factories, organizations, and schools have launched discussions, and some have directly sent their opinions to the newspaper. Long Yinxi and Liang Jing of the Eighth District Federation of Trade Unions, and Xiao Gang of the Third District Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out: Foreign Minister Zhou's statement is another solemn declaration by the Chinese people. The Chinese people have already expelled the Kuomintang bandit leaders from mainland China, and will soon liberate Taiwan, Tibet, and Hainan Island, completely eliminating all remnant bandits. The illegal representatives of the remnant bandits in the Security Council should have been told to get out long ago. Professor Zhong Jingwen of the Chinese Language and Literature Department of the Normal University said: "It is an absurd joke that a small group of remnant bandits who have fled to an isolated island actually have representatives sitting on the Security Council of the United Nations, and even sitting on the rostrum!" Employees of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Gao Qingyuan and Wang Rongxin, also enthusiastically expressed their opinions, believing that Foreign Minister Zhou's statement demanding the expulsion of the remnant bandits' "representatives" from the Security Council is the unanimous will of the Chinese people. Regarding the Soviet Union's firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, they said: "Our true friends have a sincere attitude of friendship in everything. We, the Chinese people, should thank the Soviet Union for its support." The employees of the North China Highway Bureau, the Student Union of the Normal University, Beijing Municipal Normal School, North China Middle School, and the No. 2 Boys' Middle School, also wrote their opinions, pointing out that Britain has expressed its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with our country, but Britain still sided with American imperialism to protect Jiang Tingfu in the Security Council. This shows that imperialism is still imperialism, and it is still the deadly enemy of peaceful people. We must always be vigilant about British imperialism playing two-faced policies towards the Chinese people.
    Some workers, when talking about Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, straightened their chests and said bluntly: "Foreign Minister Zhou has clearly and simply told the world what we want to say. We can only step up production and support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement with action."

    把蒋廷黻赶出安理会！
    首都人民热烈拥护周外长声明
    并感谢苏联坚持正义力予支持
    【本报讯】首都工人、学生、各机关职员等，对于周恩来部长八日致电联合国安全理事会要求驱逐非法的国民党残余匪帮代表的声明和苏联代表首先支持周外长声明、坚决主张把残匪非法代表逐出联合国安理会一事，继续热烈表示拥护。有些工厂、机关、学校展开了讨论，有的就直接把自己的意见送到报馆来。本市八区工会办事处龙印玺、梁敬，三区工会肖刚等都指出：周外长的声明，就是中国人民再一次的庄严宣告，中国人民已经在中国大陆上驱逐了国民党匪首，并且不久就要解放台湾、西藏、海南岛，彻底消灭一切残匪，残匪在安理会的非法代表，早就应该要他快滚蛋。师大中国语文学系钟敬文教授说：“逃在一个孤岛上的一小撮残匪，居然有代表坐在联合国的安全理事会上，甚至还坐在主席台上，这是何等荒诞的笑话！”邮政储金汇业局的职工高庆元、王荣新等也都热烈发表了自己的意见，认为周外长声明驱逐残匪在安理会的“代表”，是中国人民一致的意志；对苏联坚决支持周外长声明这一行动，他们说：“我们的真正朋友，在一切事情上都是朋友的真诚态度。我们中国人民应该感谢苏联的支持。”华北公路总局的职工们，师大学生会、北京市立师范、华北中学、男二中的同学们，也纷纷写出自己的意见，他们指出，英国已经表示愿和我国建立外交关系了，但是英国在安理会上却还是和美帝国主义一起袒护蒋廷黻，这里就说明了帝国主义终究是帝国主义，终究是和平人民的死对头，我们得随时警惕英国帝国主义对中国人玩弄两面政策。
    有的工人们在谈到周外长声明时，他们挺挺胸膛，直截了当地说：“周外长把我们要说的话，简单明白向世界说清了，我们就只有加紧生产，以行动来支持周外长的声明。”
