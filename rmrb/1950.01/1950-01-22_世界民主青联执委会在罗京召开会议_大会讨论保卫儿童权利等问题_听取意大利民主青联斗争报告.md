Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 21st: According to TASS, Bucharest: The first meeting of the Second Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDF) opened in Bucharest, Romania, on the 17th. The main agenda of the meeting is: 1. The tasks of the WFDF in the struggle to protect children's rights; 2. To hear a report on the struggle of the Italian Democratic Youth for peace and their political and economic rights; 3. The attitude towards the leading bodies of the so-called "People's Youth of Yugoslavia." As of the 19th, the Executive Committee had already conducted heated discussions on the first two items on the agenda.

WFDF General Secretary Boukalla reported at the Executive Committee meeting that the huge military expenditures and war policies of the imperialist countries are heavily weighing on the shoulders of the working people, condemning their children to poverty and starvation. The struggle for children's rights is an integral part of the struggle for peace, democracy, and the happy life of the younger generation. After talking about the great achievements of the Soviet Union in educating children, Boukalla emphasized that the WFDF and various democratic youth organizations must widely publicize these achievements. Finally, Boukalla put forward a proposal on the WFDF's work to protect children, saying that the WFDF must fight for the democratic education of children together with the International Democratic Women's Federation and the World Federation of Trade Unions, and it must actively participate in the preparation and celebration of International Children's Day—July 1, 1950.

The Executive Committee heatedly discussed Boukalla's report. Soviet youth representative Kozimazov said that exploiting children is one of the most heinous and despicable crimes of imperialism. He put forward a number of suggestions aimed at strengthening the WFDF's struggle for children's rights and democratic education. Wu Xueqian, the Chinese representative, said that after the Chinese people won victory, millions of children have gained the opportunity to study. WFDF Secretary Hockham (UK) and representatives from Germany, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Austria, Hungary, Greece, Vietnam, Cuba, Brazil, and other countries also expressed their opinions on the issue of protecting children's rights. Based on the suggestion of WFDF Chairman Bauer, the Executive Committee formed a committee responsible for drafting resolutions on the issues discussed at the meeting.

At the meeting on the 19th, Billinguer, the leader of the Italian "Youth League," presented a report on the Italian democratic youth's struggle for peace and their economic and political rights. He described the plight of unemployed and unschooled youth in Marshall Plan-ized Italy. He pointed out that Italian youth are actively struggling for their rights, for peace and democracy. He exposed the divisive activities carried out by the right-wing social democratic leaders of the Italian Catholic youth, and pointed out that exposing the imperialist running dogs in the youth ranks is one of the main tasks of the struggle for peace and for the unity of the youth ranks. Billinguer concluded by saying that the Italian "Youth League" cultivates its members in the spirit of internationalism and brotherhood with the Soviet Union and with Stalin. The Executive Committee heatedly discussed Billinguer's report.

    世界民主青联总书记布加拉在执委会会议上报告称：各帝国主义国家中的庞大的军备开支及战争政策，正在沉重地压在劳动者的肩上，使他们的儿童注定了要遭受贫困与饥饿。争取儿童权利的斗争，是争取和平、民主及年青一代幸福生活的斗争的一个组成部分。布加拉在谈到苏联在教养儿童方面的巨大成就之后强调称：世界民主青联及各民主青年组织必须广泛宣扬这些成就。最后，布加拉提出了关于世界民主青联保卫儿童工作的提案，布加拉说：世界民主青联必须与国际民主妇联及世界工联一道，为儿童的民主教养而斗争，它必须积极参加国际儿童日——一九五○年七月一日的准备与庆祝。
    执委会热烈讨论了布加拉的报告。苏联青年代表科齐马索夫说，剥削儿童是帝国主义最可恶与最卑劣的罪行之一。他提出了若干旨在加强世界民主青联争取儿童权利与民主教养斗争的建议。中国代表吴学谦说，中国人民获得胜利之后，千百万儿童已获得了学习的机会。世界民主青联书记霍卡姆（英）与德、罗、捷、波、奥、匈、希腊、越南、古巴、巴西等国的代表，均曾对保卫儿童权利的问题发表意见。执委会根据世界民主青联主席鲍埃逊的建议，组成了负责草拟关于会上讨论之问题的决议案的委员会。
    在十九日的会议上，意大利“青年同盟”领袖比林格尔提出关于意大利民主青年为和平和他们的经济、政治权利而斗争的报告。他描述了马歇尔化意大利的青年失业失学的苦况，他指出，意大利青年为着他们的权利，为着和平与民主正在积极地进行斗争。他揭露了意大利天主教青年的右翼社会民主党领袖所进行的分裂活动，并指出：揭露青年队伍中的帝国主义走狗，是争取和平和争取青年队伍之团结这一斗争的主要任务之一。比林格尔最后说：意大利“青年同盟”本着国际主义以及与苏联、与斯大林亲如兄弟的精神来培养它的盟员。执委会热烈地讨论了比林格尔的报告。
