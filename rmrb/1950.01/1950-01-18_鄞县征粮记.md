The Yin County Party Committee convened an expanded meeting of the County Committee on December 20th to summarize the grain collection work of the past month.

According to reports from various districts, the county has completed the storage of 20,793,000 catties of grain (with approximately 12 million catties of reserve grain), more than 340,000 catties of firewood, and the uncovering of 100,560 mu of illegally concealed land, accounting for one-sixth of the county's total land area of 637,744 mu. Thirty-six townships have begun to pay grain, with Feng'ao Township in Gulin District having completed the entire task, and Jiangshan Township having largely completed it. The remaining townships are preparing to pay grain or have begun to pay grain. The county currently has 41,100 members of peasant associations (excluding Zhangshui District), established 497 village governments (excluding Zhangshui District), and 49 township peasant associations (all established). There are a total of 6,700 members of the self-defense forces and militia, and over 6,700 members of women's associations and children's corps, accounting for 11.8% of the county's population, an increase of 4.5% compared to before the grain collection. The County Committee also summarized the following issues from this work:

    Learn the Correct Grain Collection Policy and Break Down Cadre's Fear of Difficulty

First, it is essential to clarify the cadres' thinking, that is, to fight against the right-leaning ideology of fearing difficulties. Without resolving this issue, it is impossible to complete the task. For example, cadres in Zhangshui District felt that the figures allocated at the Peasant Representative Conference were too heavy, and their thinking was not clear. Therefore, in the half month after the Peasant Representative Conference, the grain collection work in the entire district (except for Yinzhang Township) had not started. In addition, after resolving the cadres' thinking, it is necessary to learn the policies and methods of grain collection. For example, cadres in Qianhu District, because they had not learned the grain collection regulations and calculation methods, initially calculated the task for each township based on the assumption that each mu of rented land should contribute the same amount, resulting in errors in some calculations. They only discovered this close to the grain payment deadline, which delayed the completion of the task and caused a lot of trouble.

    Hold Good Peasant Representative Conferences and Launch Campaigns Against Illegally Concealed Land

Second, convening Peasant Representative Conferences, and holding them well, is a crucial link in completing grain collection. At the conference, repeatedly clarify the representatives' thinking, raise their class consciousness, and make them truly realize that paying grain is for their own benefit. Then, accurately allocate the figures. All districts and townships that followed this principle completed the grain collection task smoothly. However, some districts and townships, due to a purely task-oriented perspective, allocated the grain collection figures to various villages without principle, arbitrarily increasing the amounts, changing the figures randomly, and failing to mobilize the masses against illegally concealed land. For example, in Longming, Gaojia, Xinjian, Jingdong, and Meixu townships in Qianhu District, the numbers were assigned simply through mutual challenges among representatives and self-reporting at the Peasant Representative Conference, without properly implementing the principle of "old burdens for new areas," and without studying how to mobilize the masses against illegally concealed land. Later, when they heard complaints from some village cadres and the masses, they arbitrarily increased or decreased the already allocated figures, which instead suppressed the masses' enthusiasm for uncovering illegally concealed land and caused serious detours in the work.

    Prevent Cadre Complacency and Avoid Delaying Grain Payment

In addition, it is necessary to prevent complacency among cadres. For example, in Qianhu District, the township Peasant Representative Conferences were generally successful, and the masses' awareness was raised, expressing confidence in paying the "liberation grain" well. As a result, the cadres became complacent, thinking that everything was no problem. Thus, they did not continue to go deep into the villages to mobilize the masses and conduct checks and supervision. Consequently, the work of uncovering illegally concealed land and collecting grain in the villages could not be carried out. Similarly, in the twelfth village of Jiangshan Township, the activists were very enthusiastic at the Peasant Representative Conference, so it was assumed that there would be no problem in completing the task, and the working cadres relaxed. As a result, the village was very slow in paying grain.

Third, uncover illegally concealed land. Villages that were successful in uncovering illegally concealed land completed grain collection smoothly, and the masses' morale was high. For example, in Daigong Village (4,000 mu) in Gulin Township, and in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, sixteenth, and seventeenth villages in Jiangshan Township, because a relatively large amount of illegally concealed land was uncovered, the grain payment was completed very quickly, with some villages completing the entire task in two days.

Correct and in-depth publicity of the reasonable burden policy is the main key to inspiring the masses' enthusiasm for uncovering illegally concealed land. This is because the masses are concerned that uncovering illegally concealed land will increase their quota. For example, cadres in the eleventh village of Jiangshan Township only complained that the assigned task was too heavy and lacked confidence in completing it, and were not actively uncovering illegally concealed land. However, when the leadership allocated 100,000 catties of grain to the village, the village cadres and masses actively uncovered illegally concealed land, resulting in the uncovering of 370 mu of illegally concealed land, exceeding the task by 15,000 catties, and the masses' morale suddenly increased.

    Strictly Prevent Landlords' Sabotage and Raise the Masses' Class Consciousness

The process of uncovering illegally concealed land is also the process of mobilizing the masses to fight against landlords. In the eighth village of Penpu Township, only 4 mu out of more than 200 mu of illegally concealed land belonged to tenant farmers. Therefore, landlords attempted to sabotage the uncovering of illegally concealed land and grain collection through various means, such as dividing households, separating families, and buying off village cadres and activists. For example, Gong Pengyou, a landlord in Gulin Township, tried to bribe Gu Yuexin, the director of the peasant association, three times with grain, money, and meat during the uncovering of illegally concealed land, but Gu Yuexin sternly exposed him. Also, Zhang Xihua, Zhang Houcai, and Zhang Shanglin, landlords in the seventh village of Penpu Township, bribed Zhang Changnian, the village clerk, with wine, chicken, and grain in order to divide households and evade their burdens. Based on the above facts, uncovering illegally concealed land and preventing the division of households are the most acute first line of struggle with landlords in grain collection. These struggles also tested the position and awareness of village cadres, and strengthening the class consciousness of village cadres and the masses is the main weapon to crush the landlords' conspiracies.

In addition, when some villages have uncovered illegally concealed land, causing the grain collection amount to exceed the original quota, it is necessary to prevent the occurrence of purely economic viewpoints among some village cadres and the masses, such as failing to reduce burdens according to regulations. For example, some village cadres in Jiangshan Township advocated using the excess task to run cooperatives as village administrative expenses, rather than reducing the burden per mu. Some advocated reducing burdens based on grades. This exceeded the government's established regulations, but was later corrected through persuasion and education from the leadership.

    Check Grain Payment Preparations and Organize Villagers to Collectively Deliver Grain

Fourth, check grain payment preparations. After uncovering illegally concealed land and calculating the accounts, cadres tend to easily listen to the village cadres' reports saying that there are no problems without conducting in-depth checks and underestimating the difficulties. For example, in the eleventh, twelfth, fourteenth, and fifteenth villages of Jiangshan Township, and in some villages of Penpu Township, because the preparatory work was not thoroughly checked in advance, it was discovered when grain collection began that many households had not prepared the grain. Therefore, in order to complete the task smoothly and quickly, it is necessary to conduct in-depth checks beforehand, and mobilize the leading role of village cadres, members, and farmers, such as taking the lead in paying good grain, paying grain first, and promptly convening meetings to mobilize households that have not made preparations.

Fifth, organize the delivery of grain to the granary. Village cadres, members of peasant associations, and farmers should take the lead in paying grain first, and wage struggles against landlords who delay or resist payment. This is the most acute second line of struggle with landlords in grain collection. Delivering grain collectively by village and by household is a good method.

Sixth, mobilize the masses and combine government forces to concentrate on clearing up the remaining amounts. At this time, the main concern is that cadres and the masses will relax.

    鄞县征粮记
    浙江通讯
    鄞县县委于十二月二十日召开了县委会扩大会议，总结一月以来的征粮工作。
    综合各区汇报，全县已完成入仓粮二千零七十九万三千斤（预备粮约为一千二百万斤），柴火三十四万余斤，反出黑地十万零五千六百亩，占全县地亩总数六三七七四四亩的六分之一，有三十六个乡开始缴粮，其中古林区凤嶴乡已全部完成，姜山乡亦已大部完成，其余的乡正在准备交粮或开始交粮，全县现有农会员四万一千一百名（缺樟水区）建立村政权四九七个（缺樟水区）乡农协四九个（已全部建立），自卫队民兵共六千七百名，妇女会、儿童团等有六千七百余名，占全县人口百分之十一·八，比征粮前扩充了百分之四·五。县委会并从这段工作中，总结出如下问题：
            学会征粮正确政策打破干部畏难思想
    第一、首先打通干部思想，即与畏难右倾思想作斗争，不解决这个思想，就无法完成任务。例如樟水区干部对农代会上所分配的数字觉得太重，思想打不通，因此在农代会后半月中，全区征粮工作（除鄞樟乡外）还没有动起来。另外当解决了干部思想后，则必需要学会征粮的政策和办法，例如钱湖区干部，因未学会征粮条例及计算办法，所以在开始布置各乡任务时，是以自出租田都一亩顶一亩计算，结果部分算错了，直到快交粮时才发觉，于是耽误了完成任务的时间，增加了很多麻烦。
            开好农代会发动反黑地
    第二、召开农代会，开好农代会是完成征粮的重要一环，在会上反复打通代表思想，提高其阶级觉悟，真正的认识到交粮是为了自己，然后，真确的分配数字，凡是执行了这个原则的区乡，征粮任务就完成得顺利。但有的区乡，由于单纯的任务观点，在布置各乡村征粮数字时，无原则的乱加成数，乱变动数字，而不发动群众反黑地，如钱湖区的陇明、高嘉、新建、泾东、梅墟等乡，在农代会上单纯用代表互相挑战及自报公议的方法分配数字，没有很好执行旧派新摊的原则，及研究如何发动群众反黑地，而以后又听到某些村干及群众苦叫时，则又无原则的将已分配好的数字进行随便的增减，这样就相反的压抑了群众反黑地的积极性，并使工作走了严重的弯路。
            防止干部自满交粮不要拖拉
    另外，要防止干部的自满思想，如钱湖区，在乡农代会上一般开得较成功，会上群众觉悟提高了，表示有信心交好翻身粮，因此干部就自满起来，认为一切都不成问题了，这样就不继续深入农村里去动员群众及检查督促，结果村里的反黑地征粮等工作就开展不起来，姜山乡十二村亦因该村积极分子在农代会上情绪很高，因此认为完成任务无问题，工作干部就松了一口气，结果该村在交粮中非常拖拉。
    第三、反黑地，凡是反黑地有成绩的乡村，完成征粮就顺利了，群众情绪也就很高，如古林乡的戴龚二村（四千亩），姜山乡的三、四、五、六、七、十六、十七等村，因反出黑地较多，完成缴粮也就很迅速，有的两天完成了全村任务。
    正确的、深入的宣传合理负担政策，是启发群众反黑地积极性的主要关键，因群众顾虑反出黑地派额加重，如姜山乡十一村干部，任务分配下去时，光叫太重，没有信心完成也不积极反黑地，但领导上分派该村的十万斤粮谷，村干和群众积极的去反黑地，结果反出了三百七十亩黑地，超过任务一万五千斤，群众情绪突然提高。
            严防地主阴谋破坏提高群众阶级觉悟
    反黑地的过程，也就是发动群众和地主作斗争的过程，盆浦乡八村，二百多亩的黑地中，只有四亩是佃户的，因此地主企图利用种种手段，破坏反黑地征粮，如分散户头和分家及收买村干积极分子等，如古林乡地主龚彭友，在反黑地中曾三次的用谷子、金钱、肉等企图收买农协主任顾月新，结果被顾月新严厉的揭穿了，又盆浦乡七村地主张西华、张侯才、张上林等为了分散户头逃避负担，而用酒、鸡、谷等东西收买了该村文书张昌年，根据以上事实，反黑地反分散户口是征粮中与地主斗争最尖锐的第一关，在这些斗争中也考验了村干部的立场和觉悟，而加强对村干和群众的阶级觉悟是粉碎地主阴谋的主要武器。
    另外当有些乡村反出黑地后，使征粮数超过原派额时，就必需防止某些村干及群众的单纯的经济观点，不按条例减轻负担等偏向之发生，如姜山乡有的村村干曾主张将超过的任务办合作社充当村政费等之用，而不愿每亩减轻负担，有的主张分等级来减，这样，超出了政府既定的条例，但后来经领导上的说服教育已得到了纠正。
            检查交粮准备工作组织村民集体送粮
    第四、检查交粮准备工作，反出黑地算了账以后，干部往往容易单听村干会报说没有问题了，就不深入检查，对困难估计过低，例如姜山乡十一、十二、十四、十五等村及盆浦乡的有些村因事先检查工作不深入，当开始征粮时，才发觉很多户都没有准备好粮，因此要使任务顺利而迅速的完成，事先必须深入检查，发动村干、会员、农民的带头作用，如带头交好粮，先交粮，及时的召集无准备户开会动员。
    第五、组织送粮入仓，村干、农会员、农民带头先交，并与拖交抗交地主展开斗争，这是征粮中与地主斗争最尖锐的第二关，以户为单位，一村集体送是好办法。
    第六、发动群众结合政府力量，集中扫清尾数，这时主要怕干部群众松了气。
