    The Fire of a Prairie Fire
    By Tian Liu, special correspondent for this newspaper in Shenyang
    Editor's Note: This article reports on the vigorous "Create New Production Records" movement underway in the economic construction of Northeast China. The full text is divided into four sections, the first of which was published on page three of this newspaper on December 22nd last year. A summary of the first section is as follows: The mass movement on the production front, like the mass movement on the political front, can ignite a prairie fire with just two sparks. The "Create New Production Records" movement of hundreds of thousands of workers in Northeast China was ignited by two fellow workers, Zhang Shangju and Zhao Guoyou, advanced producers at the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory. In September, after Zhang Shangju created a record of scribing a lathe in 11 hours and 30 minutes, and Zhao Guoyou created a record of machining a "stepped pulley" in 1.16 minutes, it immediately attracted attention from all sides. The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government decided to launch a "Create New Production Records" movement in all mines and factories. The liberated working class of Northeast China immediately launched a mass movement to "Learn from Zhang Shangju" and "Catch up with Zhao Guoyou." From factories to mines, from heavy industry to light industry, from railways to trade departments, the fire of the "Create New Production Records" movement burned everywhere. Readers are invited to continue reading this article for the main content and experience of this movement.
            
            Pseudo-Manchu Standards—Break Them!
            The Idea That Pseudo-Manchu Standards Could Not Be Surpassed Has Been Shattered
    The "Create New Production Records" movement has developed so rapidly and fiercely that it has astonished some staff members—those who cling to "Pseudo-Manchu standards" and "authoritative estimates of work." They were shocked by the unprecedented creativity and boundless wisdom of the working class, and became confused in the face of the movement. The Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory planned to produce 30 machines in September. After the workers discussed it, they raised it to 40 machines, and at the end of the month they completed 45 machines. After the workers in Anshan broke the engineering construction plan twice, the planning staff drew up a higher plan for the third time, but the workers broke it again. This astonished even experienced engineering and technical personnel at the creative genius and selfless production enthusiasm of the workers. He said, "I can calculate theoretical efficiency, but I cannot calculate the workers' production enthusiasm." —The workers' production enthusiasm, the working class's love and concern for the enterprise, is precisely the greatest driving force for industrial construction! But some enterprise management cadres and technical personnel have precisely overlooked this point. At the beginning of the movement, although they also believed that time could be shortened and efficiency could be improved compared to the present, they insisted that "it will never exceed the Pseudo-Manchu standards and authoritative estimates of work." The workers gave heroic contempt and disdain to what they called "authoritative estimates of work" and "Pseudo-Manchu standards." They said, "That was the standard when we were slaves, the standard when we were beasts of burden. Now we must create our own standards, the standards of masters." Therefore, breaking through the Pseudo-Manchu standards, breaking through the decadent technical norms of the bourgeoisie, "creating new norms!" and "creating our own standards!" became the oath of the liberated working class of Northeast China to participate in the creation of new records. The workers of the Second Power Plant of the Benxi Coal and Iron Company, like the glorious soldiers of the People's Liberation Army making a solemn oath before entering battle, submitted "resolutions to create new records" to the factory leadership, specifically stipulating their own technical standards and goals. By the end of October, 73 percent of the plant's workers had created various new records, increasing the efficiency of the No. 1 generator from 8,000 KW to 11,000 KW. By the end of October, more than 1,000 workers at the Fushun Victory Coal Mine had created new records. On October 13, the Kong Xiangrui coal mining team created a record of mining 6.8 tons of coal per shift. On the 20th, they created a record of 8.55 tons, but the Li Quanshun team mined 10 tons per shift, and the Zheng Wenyou team even created an unprecedented record of mining 15 tons of coal per shift. The mine's daily output increased from 1,080 tons to 3,030 tons. The current average efficiency of the mine has reached more than 7 tons per shift. When Dang Huian, a worker at the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory specializing in "lead screws," created a record of 8.30 hours, some technical personnel in the factory's planning section insisted, "It can never exceed the Pseudo-Manchu standard of 6 hours." Before they finished speaking, a record of 3.59 hours was created. After the news of Dang Huian was published in the newspaper, Zhao Fuyou, a lead screw worker at the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, surpassed him with a record of 3.09 hours. Dang Huian responded to Zhao Fuyou the next day with 2.37 hours. How insignificant and ridiculous the "Pseudo-Manchu standard" has become in the face of the great working class of Northeast China! This forced those technical personnel who clung to "it will never exceed the Pseudo-Manchu standard" to go to the workers to study the reasons for such high efficiency. The result was that "the tools were transformed, the machine efficiency was improved, the machine ran faster and the power was more even, so the quality was improved." The conservative view that "slow work produces fine work," a legacy of thousands of years of feudal society, and a "truth experienced" by some cadres in organizing rural handicraft production, was shattered, and they began to realize that in the machine industry, with the improvement of machinery and the mastery of technology, "fast work can also produce good work."

            From Individual Creation of New Records to Collective Creation of New Records
    The movement surged forward with unprecedented speed and scale. By the end of October, it had developed from new records that increased labor intensity to shorten working hours, to the transformation of tools and the improvement of technology; from individual competition to competition between groups and workshops. They not only wanted to create new records for a certain type of work, and not only wanted to create new individual records, but also wanted to create collective, factory-wide new records, and to improve the overall production efficiency. The wisdom of the workers is infinite, and the unique creativity of the liberated working class is immeasurable. In order to break through the Pseudo-Manchu standards in overall production efficiency and create new factory-wide production records, they gradually implemented a "workshop contract system" on the basis of the individual responsibility system, in order to overcome the phenomenon that although new records appeared every day, the factory's overall production could not be improved every day.
    The "workshop contract system" is established according to the overall production plan. It stipulates that each workshop, group, and even individual must produce a certain quantity of products of a certain standard within a certain period of time. If any person or department fails to complete the task, it will affect the realization of the entire plan. Therefore, the workers encouraged, guaranteed, and supervised each other, and no one wanted to affect the honor of the whole because of themselves. The Huanggu District Rolling Stock Plant learned from the Soviet Union and implemented the "assembly line method," placing the production tasks smoothly on a line according to the production process, organizing the labor force reasonably and appropriately according to the quantity and quality requirements of the products, and according to the machine efficiency and the technical level of the workers, ensuring the completion of a certain quantity and quality of products in the same workshop, connecting and promoting each other, and producing smoothly in an endless stream. This rapidly increased the plant's total production rate. In the past, it took 10 days to build a freight car. Now, a little more than three days is enough. With a 16 percent reduction in the total number of workers, the output increased from 18 cars per month in the first half of the year to 56 cars now. The cost of each car has also decreased by more than 15 percent. Other factories and mines in Anshan, Benxi, Fushun, and many other places are also brewing to create comprehensive, factory-wide new records. In early November, the Fushun mines and factories began to discuss and brew among the workers, on the basis of the existing 6,000 workers who had created more than 1,000 new records. By the 16th, all preparations were completed. In addition to establishing a comprehensive overall plan, each department also established more specific plans based on the overall plan. Large plans were connected to small plans, with division of labor and responsibility, clear goals, mutual connections, and clear responsibilities. By mid-December, the plant will increase overall efficiency by 20 to 30 percent.
    The glorious working class of Northeast China is not only completing its own heroic cause of creating new records, but also influencing, promoting, and even leading those staff members who are confused in the movement while clinging to "Pseudo-Manchu standards" to move forward, so that under the influence of the working class's selfless and heroic labor, they participate in the surging "Create New Production Records" movement. When administrative cadres, engineers, and staff members participate in the creation of new records, and when leadership and the masses, theory and experience are combined, the new record movement will gallop forward even more robustly and powerfully.

           "Welcome to Visit Often!"
    Enterprise Management Personnel and Technical Personnel Stand Firmly at the Front of the Movement, Leading the Movement to Develop

    Enterprise management cadres and technical personnel stand firmly at the front of the movement, providing timely and effective organization and leadership to the "Create New Production Records" movement, so that the movement can develop further—Comrade Xu Hongwen, deputy manager of Benxi Coal and Iron Company, and the engineers and technicians under his leadership have done this, and have done it very well. In July of this year, after the company received instructions from the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government on opposing waste, practicing thrift, and implementing economic accounting, it conducted a comprehensive anti-waste struggle among all employees. The employees said: Unscientific operating methods, poor labor organization, and low production efficiency are the biggest wastes. Therefore, in the later stage of the anti-waste struggle, people gradually studied how to improve production efficiency. Comrade Xu Hongwen convened engineers, technicians, and relevant staff members more than once to study the key operation of the coal industry—tunnel excavation. After studying in detail the issues of the drilling angle, depth, mutual distance, and amount of explosives in the basic link of tunnel operation—the "drilling work"—they went to the tunnel site together to conduct on-site experiments—this was a big deal. The engineering and technical personnel who had always sat in the office suddenly came to the tunnel together, causing a great shock to the workers. The workers greeted them with surprise, suspicion, excitement, and joy, watching them curiously and discussing them. Some workers said, "Look at how scientific you are!" Others said, "Don't delay our production with your experiments!" Obviously, the workers expressed suspicion and dissatisfaction with the fact that engineers and technicians always like to sit in the office and talk about "science," and rarely come to the site to lead production, but more workers were excited by this novel move and actively helped and participated in their experiments. During the experiment, some were conducted according to the experience of old technical workers, some were conducted according to scientific regulations, and some were conducted according to the method of combining theory and worker experience; some were tested with nitroglycerin explosives, some were tested with a mixture of nitroglycerin and ammonium nitrate explosives... a total of eight methods were repeatedly tested eleven times in "working faces" with different hardness. As a result, each experimental shift advanced at least 0.70 meters, and at most 1.08 meters, with an average of 0.90 meters. The average efficiency per shift was 0.89 cubic meters, an increase of 147 percent compared with the Pseudo-Manchu standard of 0.36 cubic meters, and an increase of 51 percent compared with the May labor emulation campaign. The workers were excited by this unprecedented excavation efficiency. After the engineers explained the reasons for the efficiency improvement to the workers, the workers simply jumped up with joy, clapped their hands and shouted, "Hey! It's really effective. Welcome to visit often!" The workers universally learned this new method. In September, the "one haulage" work team of the East Fifth Rock Tunnel, consisting of eight people, advanced 53.60 meters in 26 days, with an average efficiency per shift of 0.83 cubic meters. Under the leadership of Deputy Manager Xu and the engineers, technicians, and all management cadres under his leadership, the "Create New Production Records" movement of Benxi Coal and Iron Company achieved greater success. Due to the improvement of operating methods, not only were more than 100 workers saved to do other work, but coal production also increased from 2,300 tons per day to 3,000 tons; the construction yard also increased production by more than 30 percent, and the machinery plant exceeded the October output by two times in November. As of November 20, statistics showed that the company's "Create New Production Records" movement had spread to its 7 departments and 47 mines and factories, with more than 4,000 advanced producers creating more than 1,000 new records. On the basis of the victory of the new record movement, the company's Second Power Plant has successfully completed and determined the quota standards for major types of work, and has begun to implement quota management to carry out more planned production.

    燎原的火焰
    本报驻沈记者  田流
    编者按：本文报导东北经济建设中正在热烈开展着的创造生产新纪录运动，全文共分四节，第一节已于去年十二月二十二日刊于本报三版。后因稿挤未即续登，第一节概要介绍如下：生产战线上的群众运动像政治战线的群众运动一样，两个火花便可燃起燎原的大火，东北数十万工人的创造生产新纪录运动就是沈阳第三机器厂先进生产者张尚举、赵国有这两位工友点燃起来的。九月间张尚举创造了车床划线十一小时三十分钟，赵国有创造了车“塔轮”一点十六分钟的纪录后，立时引起了各方的重视，中共中央东北局，东北人民政府工业部并决定一切矿厂普遍开展创造生产新纪录运动。解放了的东北工人阶级立时展开“学习张尚洗”“追赶赵国有”的群众运动，从工厂到矿山，从重工业到轻工业，从铁路到贸易部门，到处燃烧起创造生产新纪录运动的燎原大火。这个运动的主要内容和经验请读者继续阅读本文。
            伪满标准——突破它！
            打破了伪满标准不能突破的观念
    创造新纪录运动发展得如此迅速而猛烈，以致使一部分职员——那些抱住“伪满标准”“权威估工”不放的职员们感到惊异，他们被工人阶级空前的创造力和无量的智慧所震骇，在运动面前迷惘起来。沈阳第三机械厂九月份计划生产机器三十台，工人们一讨论把它提到四十台，而月底竟完成了四十五台；鞍山工人两次突破工程修建计划后，计划人员又第三次订出了更高的计划，但工人又把它突破了。使得有经验的工程技术人员也对工人天才的创造性与忘我的生产热情感到惊异，他说：“我能计算理论效能，却计算不出工人的生产热情。”——工人的生产热情，工人阶级对企业的爱护和关心，却正是工业建设最大的原动力啊！但有些企业管理干部和技术人员却恰恰忽略了这一点，在运动开始时，他们虽然也相信时间还可以缩短，效率也可比现在提高，但他们坚持“绝超不过伪满标准和权威的估工。”工人们对什么“权威估工”、“伪满标准”却给予英雄的唾弃和藐视，他们说：“那是当亡国奴时的标准，做牛马时的标准，现在要创造自己的标准，主人的标准。”因此，突破伪满标准，突破资产阶级腐朽了的技术定额，“创造新的定额！”“创造自己的标准！”便成为解放了的东北工人阶级参加创造新纪录的誓言豪语。本溪煤铁公司第二发电厂工人像人民解放军的光荣战士投入战斗之前的庄严宣誓一样，每一个工人，每一个生产小组，都向厂部呈递了“创造新纪录决心书”，具体规定着自己的技术标准和奋斗目标，十月底该厂已有百分之七十三的工人创造了各种新纪录，使一号发电机的效率由八千Ｋ·Ｗ·Ｈ·提高到一万一千Ｋ·Ｗ·Ｈ·。抚顺胜利煤矿到十月底已有千余工人创造新纪录，十月十三日孔祥瑞采煤小组创造每工挖煤六、八吨的纪录，二十日又创八、五五吨纪录，可是李全顺组却每工挖到十吨，郑文友组竟创每工挖煤十五吨的空前纪录，全矿的日产量由一、○八○吨提高到三、○三○吨，现该矿总平均效率已达每工七吨多。当沈阳第三机械厂专作“丝杠”工人党会安创八点三十分的纪录时，该厂计划股一部分技术人员一口咬定：“无论如何也超不过伪满六小时的标准”，一言未落，三点五十九分的纪录又创出来了，报纸上把党会安的消息登出后，第一机器厂车丝杠工人赵富有以三点零九分的纪录超过了他，党会安第二日又以二点三十七分回答了赵富有。“伪满标准”在伟大的东北工人阶级面前已经变成了怎样渺小的可笑的“标准”了啊！使得那些抱住“绝超不过伪满标准”的技术人员不得不跑到工人面前去研究效率如此提高的原因，结果是“改造了工具，机器效能提高了，机器运转快、力量平均，因之质量反而提高。”那种数千年来封建社会遗留下的，又为某些干部在组织农村手工业生产时所“体验出的真理”——“慢工出细活”的保守看法破灭了，开始体会到，在机器工业中，随着机械的改进和技术的熟练，“快工一样出好活”。
            由个人创造新纪录发展到集体创造新纪录
    运动以空前的速度空前的规模汹涌前进，到十月末已由增强劳动强度以缩短工时的新纪录，发展到改造工具提高技术；已由个人的竞赛发展到组与组、车间与车间的竞赛，他们不仅要创造某一工种的新纪录，不仅要创造个人的新纪录，还要创造集体的、全场的新纪录，把整个的生产效率提高一步。工人智慧是无穷的，解放了的工人阶级特有的创造性是不可限量的，他们为了在总的生产效率上突破伪满标准，创造全厂的生产新纪录，又在个人负责制的基础上，逐渐实行起“车间联系合同”，以克服那种新纪录虽然天天出现，全厂生产却不能天天提高的现象。
    “车间联系合同”是根据着总的生产计划订立的，它规定着每个车间、小组以至个人，在一定时间内，产生一定标准的一定数量的产品，任何一个人或部门完不成任务，都会影响到全部计划的实现。因此，工人们互相鼓励着、保证着、督促着，谁也不愿因自己而影响了全体的荣誉。皇姑屯车辆厂向苏联学习，实行了“流水作业法”，将生产任务按着它的生产过程，顺利的摆在一条线上，按着产品的数量和质量要求，按着机器效能和工人的技术水平，合理恰当的组织劳动力，在同一车间内保证着一定数量质量产品的完成，互相衔接互相推动，川流不息的顺畅生产下去，使该厂总生产率迅速提高起来，过去造一辆货车需要十天，现在三天多一点就足够了，在全部工人缩减了百分之十六的情况下，产量却由上半年月产十八辆提高到现在的五十六辆，每辆车的成本也随着降低了百分之十五以上。其他在鞍山、本溪、抚顺及许多厂矿中，也都在酝酿着创造综合性的全厂新纪录，抚顺各矿厂在十一月初，在既有的六千余工人所创造的千种以上新纪录的基础上，开始在工人中讨论酝酿，十六日已全部准备就绪，他们除订出全面的总计划外，各部门根据总计划还订出更具体的计划，大计划小计划连在一起，分工负责，目标明确，互相连系，责任分明，到十二月半，该厂将提高全盘效能百分之二○至三○。
    光荣的东北工人阶级，不仅完成着自己创造新纪录的英雄事业，他们还影响着、推动着、甚至牵引着那一些抱着“伪满标准”在运动中迷惘起来的职员们前进，使他们在工人阶级忘我的，英勇劳动的影响下，参加到汹涌澎湃的创造生产新纪录运动中来，当行政干部、工程师和职员们参加到创造新纪录的行列，领导和群众理论和经验结合起来的时候，新纪录运动就更加健壮而有力的向前奔驰了。
           “欢迎你们常来啊！”
    企业管理人员和技术人员紧紧地站在运动前面，领导运动向前发展
    企业管理干部和技术人员紧紧地站在运动的前面，给创造生产新纪录运动以及时有效的组织和领导，使运动更进一步发展起来——本溪煤铁公司副经理徐宏文同志和他领导的工程师、技师们都这样做了，都作得很好。今年七月，该公司接到东北人民政府工业部关于反对浪费、厉行节约、实行经济核算制的指示后，就在全体职工中进行了全面的反浪费斗争。职工们说：操作方法不科学、劳动组织不好、生产效率低是最大的浪费。因此，在反浪费斗争的后期，人们便逐渐研究如何提高生产效率了。徐宏文同志曾不止一次的召集工程师、技师和有关的职员们，研究来煤工业的关键作业——坑道掘进问题。他们具体研究了坑道作业中基本环节的“打眼工作”，将打眼斜度、深度、相互距离以及炮药量等等问题详细研究后，便一同到坑道现场中去实地试验——这是一件大事情，从来就坐在办公室的工程技术人员们，突然一齐来到坑道里，引起工人很大的震动。工人们以惊奇、怀疑和兴奋、喜悦的心情迎接他们，好奇的看着他们，纷纷议论。有的工人说：“看你们这科学的呀！”也有的说：“你们试验可别耽误了我们生产啊！”显然工人们对工程师技术人员总爱坐在办公室里谈“科学”，很少到现场来领导生产表示怀疑和不满，但是更多的工友却为这别开生面的举动所兴奋，积极的帮助和参加了他们的试验。试验时，有的是按着老技术工友的试验、有的按科学规定、有的按理论与工人经验结合的方法进行；有的用甘油炸药的打眼试验、有的用甘油和硝铵炸药混合用的打眼试验……总共八种方法，在各种硬度不同的“掌子”里反复试验了十一次，结果每试验班最少的前进○·七○米，最多的达一·○八米，平均是○·九○米，每工平均能率是○·八九立方米，比伪满的○·三六立方米提高百分之一四七，比五月竞赛立功时又提高了百分之五一。工人们为这种空前的掘进能率所兴奋，当工程师给工人讲清楚效率提高的道理后，工人们简直欢喜的跳起来，拍着巴掌喊：“嗨！还是真顶事，欢迎你们常来啊！”工人们普遍的学习这新方法，九月份“一卸”东五岩石坑道的工作班，八个人二十六天已经前进五三·六○米，每工平均能率是○·八三立方米。本溪煤铁公司所属各矿厂，在徐副经理和他领导的工程师、技师及一切管理干部深入现场领导下，创造生产新纪录运动，得到了更大的成绩。由于操作方法的改进，不仅节省出一百多名工友去作别的工作，煤产量更由每日二千三百吨提高到三千吨；筹造场也提高产量百分之三十以上，机械厂十一月份超过十月产量的两倍。至十一月二十日统计，该公司的创造生产新纪录运动已遍及其所属的七部四十七矿厂中，四千余名先进生产者创造了千种以上的新纪录，该厂第二发电厂已经在新纪录运动的胜利基础上，顺利完成和确定了主要工种的定额标准，开始实现定额管理，进行更有计划的生产了。
