    Mobilizing and Organizing Industry Workers Through the Conclusion of Collective Contracts:
    Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions Achieves Preliminary Experience
    [Our Newspaper] The Industry Working Committee of the Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions in Shanxi Province has achieved preliminary results in mobilizing cotton weaving, iron, bathhouse, and barber shop workers through the conclusion and deliberation of labor-capital collective contracts. In the past two months, among the 623 cotton weaving workers, 386 members have been developed through the conclusion and deliberation of collective contracts. Among the 685 iron (including repair shop) workers, 347 members have been developed. Barber shop membership has reached 66% of the total number of workers in the industry, and bathhouse membership has grown to over 74%. In addition, night schools have been used to strengthen organizational life and enrich the content of group activities. Worker education has been carried out through large and small forums, raising class consciousness and understanding of trade unions. Currently, workers are urgently demanding to be organized. To meet this requirement, trade union preparatory committees have been established in each industry, and preparatory committee members and representatives have been elected to form member groups, worker groups, and other organizational forms. To ensure that these organizations truly become institutions leading the workers, unqualified representatives and preparatory committee members have been replaced in each industry. Strict criticism and education have also been given to individual group leaders for their bureaucratic style, abandonment of duties, loss of position, and detachment from the masses, greatly strengthening the leadership at the grassroots level of the trade union. The following preliminary experiences have been gained in this period of labor movement work:
    First, mobilizing workers must have content and be practical. Empty talk does not solve problems. For example, when deliberating the iron industry contract, the workers were not mobilized because there was no effort to expose hidden labor-capital disputes and unreasonable labor-capital relations, but only empty slogans calling for the conclusion of collective contracts. Later, under the leadership of the trade union, existing labor-capital disputes in individual factories were resolved, and the workers generally recognized the benefits of concluding contracts and joining the trade union, and organized themselves one after another.
    Second, after the workers are initially mobilized, it is easy to have excessively high demands and dependence. For example, when deliberating the barber shop contract, some workers said, "If we sign a contract, we must increase wages and improve our lives. Otherwise, what's the point of signing a contract?" Some workers said during the discussion of the draft, "We don't need to discuss it anymore, the trade union can sign a good one for us." Later, after repeated education, the purely economic viewpoint was overcome, and the concept of gradually increasing wages and improving living standards based on production was established.
    Third, representatives are "bridges." It is necessary for them to reflect the opinions of the workers and implement the intentions and policies of the leadership. The practice of cadres taking over everything will inevitably cause losses to the movement. For example, the issue of "current interests should be subordinate to long-term interests" was explained clearly to the workers by representatives of various industries, which had a very good effect.
    Fourth, the work of the capitalists cannot be abandoned. When the bathhouse industry in the city was deliberating the draft contract, it only focused on the workers and did not mobilize the capitalists. As a result, some capitalists said, "Whoever wants to sign a contract should let them do the business." Others said, "The workers are the masters now, let them sign it as they please!" As a result, the signing of the contract was hindered, and this lesson should be remembered.

    通过订立集体合同发动组织行业工人
    太原市总工会取得初步经验
    【本报讯】山西太原市总工会行业工作委员会，通过订立和酝酿劳资集体合同，发动棉织、铁业、澡塘、理发工人已取得初步成绩。两个月来，棉织业六百二十三个工人中，通过订立与酝酿集体合同已发展会员三百八十六人。铁业（包括修车业）六百八十五名工人中，已发展会员三百四十七名，理发业会员已达该业工人总数的百分之六十六，澡塘业会员已发展到百分之七十四强。此外，并利用夜校加强了组织生活，充实小组活动内容。通过大小型座谈会进行工人教育，提高了阶级觉悟及对工会的认识。目前工人迫切要求组织起来。为适应这一要求，现在各业均分别成立了工会筹委会，选出筹委、代表，组成会员小组、工人小组等组织形式。为了使这些组织真正成为领导工人的机构，各业中均分别更换了不称职的代表、筹委。对个别小组长的官僚作风及放弃职责、失掉立场脱离群众现象，亦给予严格的批评教育。使工会基层领导大大加强起来。在这段工运工作中获得了如下几条初步经验：
    第一、发动工人必须有内容，而且切合实际。光说空话是不解决问题的。如在酝酿铁业合同时，没有从揭露隐藏着的劳资纠纷及不合理的劳资关系入手，只是空洞的号召订立集体合同，结果没有把工人发动起来。后来在工会领导下，解决了个别厂中现存的劳资纠纷，工人才普遍认识到订立合同和参加工会的好处，纷纷组织起来。
    第二、在工人初步发动起来后，很容易发生过高要求及依赖思想。如酝酿理发合同时，有的工人说：“订合同就要提高工资，改善生活，不然订合同干啥？”有的工人在讨论草案时说：“咱们不用再讨论啦，工会能给咱们订好的”。后来经过反复教育，克服了单纯经济主义观点，树立了从生产出发逐渐地提高工资改善生活的观念。
    第三、代表是“桥梁”。必需经过他们把工人的意见反映上来，领导上的意图和政策贯彻下去，干部包办代替，必然使运动受到损失。比如“目前利益应服从于长远利益”的问题，经过各行业代表给工人解释清楚，收到了很好的效果。
    第四、不能放弃对资方的工作。该市澡塘业酝酿合同草案时，只着重工人，没去发动资方，因而有的资方说：“谁要订合同就把买卖交给谁干”。还有的说：“工人是主人了，让人家随便订吧”！结果使订合同受到了阻碍，这个教训应当记取。
