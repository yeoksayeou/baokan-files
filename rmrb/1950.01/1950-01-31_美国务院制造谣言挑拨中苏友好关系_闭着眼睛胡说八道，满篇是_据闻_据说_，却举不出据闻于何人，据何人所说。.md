Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 30th: The burgeoning friendship between the New China and the Soviet Union has clearly driven the U.S. State Department to uncontrollable fury. After Acheson's fabrication on January 12th was vehemently refuted, the U.S. State Department, daring not to publish any formal defense, released a so-called "background material," claiming it was informal on January 25th, and continued to spread shameless rumors. The U.S. State Department boasted that it was "based on a large accumulation of reports and investigation materials currently available to the U.S. government" and pretentiously proclaimed that "the State Department has learned more details but is not convenient to disclose them at this time." However, anyone with common sense, upon seeing the words "allegedly...generally acknowledged...there have also been rumors...allegedly...allegedly...reportedly...isolated signs strongly recall...being sought, and may now have been agreed to...there is currently no indication...appears to be in...can be expected to be divided into several stages..." "accumulated in large quantities" in the so-called "background material," can understand what kind of stuff the State Department's so-called "reports and investigation materials" or "more details" really are. Because the State Department, having become more courageous by casting aside shame, began its so-called "background material" by calling the Mongolian People's Republic, which the United States had formally agreed to and the Nationalist government had formally recognized, a "fabrication." Then this bill of rumors turned to Northeast China. The motivation behind the "background material's" making a big fuss about Northeast China is easy to understand. Because the Northeast is where the Soviet Union liberated from the hands of Japanese aggressors, because the Soviet Union enjoys rights regarding the Sino-Soviet Railway Treaty in the Northeast, and jointly defends against the threat of new aggression by Japan and its collaborators in Lushun and Dalian with China, there exists a natural high degree of friendship between the people of the Northeast and the people of the Soviet Union, a friendship that is particularly envied by American imperialists who are fostering Japanese aggressive forces. Therefore, despite the former U.S. Consul General in Shenyang, Ward, confirming on January 14th that "no signs of Soviet annexation of Manchuria were seen" and confirming that the Northeast is under "highly centralized administration" by the Beijing Central People's Government, the "background material" of January 25th still blindly claimed that the Soviet Union "occupies a dominant position" in the Northeast. The State Department wrote: "Allegedly: Soviet control of the railway in that area, both in terms of the railway itself and the attached interests, far exceeds what was anticipated in the 1945 treaty." This is complete nonsense. Allegedly by whom? An unnamed person. "The Soviet Union's influence in the local troops in Manchuria is generally acknowledged. The Chinese Communist Party has openly admitted the Soviet Union's participation in this matter." Who has "generally acknowledged" and "openly admitted" such absurdities? An unnamed person.

    美国务院制造谣言挑拨中苏友好关系
    闭着眼睛胡说八道，满篇是“据闻”“据说”，却举不出据闻于何人，据何人所说。
    【新华社北京三十日电】新中国和苏联的日益发展的友谊，显然使美国国务院愤怒得不能自持了。在艾奇逊一月十二日的造谣遭到痛驳以后，美国国务院不敢公布任何正式的辩护，却在二十五日发表了一项自称非正式的所谓“背景材料”，继续散布无耻的谣言。美国国务院吹嘘说它是“根据美政府现有的大批累积起来的报告和调查材料”，并且装模作样地宣称“国务院获悉更多的详情，但此时不便予以公布”。但是每个有常识的人，只要看到所谓“背景材料”中“大批累积”着的“据闻…公认……亦曾有传闻……据闻……据闻……据说……零星的迹象使人强烈地回想……正被觅取中，而且现在可能已被答应了……目前还没有迹象表示……看来已在……可以预料将分为几个阶段……”的字样，他就可以知道国务院所谓“报告和调查材料”或“更多的详情”究竟是一批什么货色了。因为已经不顾羞耻而愈加勇敢起来的国务院，一开始就在它的所谓“背景材料”中把美国所正式同意和国民党政府所正式承认了的蒙古人民共和国称为“杜撰”。接着这篇谣言账单就转到中国的东北。“背景材料”对中国的东北大做文章的动机是容易理解的。因为东北是苏联从日本侵略者手中所解放的地方，因为苏联在东北享有关于中长铁路条约的权利，并且在旅大与中国共同防御着日本及其合作者的新侵略的威胁，所以东北人民与苏联人民之间存在着自然的高度友谊，这种友谊乃是正在扶植日本侵略势力的美国帝国主义者所特别嫉恨的。因此，虽有美国驻沈阳前总领事瓦尔德在一月十四日证实“并未看见苏联有吞并满洲的任何迹象”，并且证实东北是受着北京中央人民政府“高度的集中管理”，一月二十五日的“背景材料”却仍然闭着眼睛说什么苏联对于东北“占有支配的地位”。国务院写道：“据闻：苏联对那个地方的铁路控制在铁路本身上和附属利益两方面，都远超过了在一九四五年条约中所预期的程度。”这是完全的胡说八道。据闻于什么人呢？无名氏。“苏联在满洲当地部队中的势力是公认的。中国共产党曾公开地承认苏联参加这件事。”谁“公认”和“公开地承认”过这种奇谈呢？无名氏。
