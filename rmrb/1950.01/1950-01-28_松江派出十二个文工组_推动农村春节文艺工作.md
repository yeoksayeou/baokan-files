Songjiang Sends Twelve Cultural Work Groups
To Promote Rural Spring Festival Literary and Artistic Work

[Our Northeast News] The preparatory committee of the Songjiang Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Provincial Cultural Work Troupe have recently established twelve cultural work groups. They are dispatched to ten counties including Huachuan, Ning'an, and Shuangcheng, as well as the rural areas of Harbin and Shuangyashan to promote Spring Festival literary and artistic work. They will assist various regions in establishing amateur cultural and recreational organizations, helping the masses to compose and perform their own works, and launching collective creation. At the same time, they will promote the convening of short training courses or forums for old artists in various counties before the Spring Festival, mobilizing old artists to participate in Spring Festival propaganda and education activities, in order to promote the transformation of old artists. In preparation for this work, the preparatory committee of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles sent people to Acheng and Lalin to conduct pilot work on organizing rural amateur theatrical troupes and transforming old artists, gaining some experience. In addition, a creation group was sent down to collect materials and write short plays. Furthermore, a training class for Spring Festival literary and artistic work was held, training literary and artistic workers from various counties to learn how to carry out mass literary and artistic activities in rural areas and organize mass creation.
