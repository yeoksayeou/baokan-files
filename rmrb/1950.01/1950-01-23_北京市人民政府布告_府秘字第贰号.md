    Provisional Rules for the Management of Transactions at the Beijing Cotton Cloth Exchange

    Article 1: All cotton cloth transactions conducted within the Beijing Cotton Cloth Exchange (hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange"), unless otherwise stipulated by central laws, shall be governed by these rules.

    Article 2: All public and private factories, firms, and businesses engaged in the textile dyeing industry, weaving and dyeing industry, knitting industry, ribbon industry, and silk and cloth industry, holding business licenses from the Municipal Commerce Bureau (or the former Industry and Commerce Bureau) and the Industrial Bureau, may apply to the Exchange for regular entry into the Exchange for trading.

    Article 3: Those who meet one of the following conditions and are approved by the Exchange may temporarily enter the Exchange for trading: ① Merchants holding business licenses from the Municipal Commerce Bureau (or the former Industry and Commerce Bureau) and engaged in the cotton cloth sales industry. ② Legitimate cotton cloth merchants from other areas or townships, holding certification documents from the local competent authority, or certification from a legitimate business in this city. ③ Cooperatives in this city holding certification from the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and farmers' cooperatives from various places holding certification from their respective cooperative.

    In addition to the aforementioned provisions, other parties who need to temporarily enter the Exchange for trading shall be subject to approval by the Commerce Bureau.

    Article 4: Those who are permitted by the Exchange to enter the Exchange for trading shall be issued an entry permit by the Exchange, the format of which shall be determined separately.

        The aforementioned entry permit shall not be lent or transferred. If lost, it must be declared invalid in the newspaper for three days, and then a guarantor must be obtained, along with the newspaper, to apply for a replacement.

    Article 5: Entry permits are divided into regular and temporary types. Regular entry permits are valid for one year and reviewed every six months for renewal. Temporary entry permits are valid for a period determined based on need.

    Article 6: The Exchange may appoint a number of brokers as needed based on business requirements, responsible for introducing transactions.

    Article 7: Those entering the Exchange for trading must wear their entry permits; otherwise, they will not be allowed to enter. During trading, they shall conduct buying and selling according to their business nature. Wholesalers are only allowed to sell goods, retailers are only allowed to buy goods, and manufacturing or processing factories are only allowed to buy raw materials and sell finished products. However, if it is truly for material exchange, it may be modified with the approval of the Exchange.

    Article 8: Those entering the Exchange for trading must entrust a broker to introduce the buying and selling. The price shall be freely and publicly negotiated by the buyer and seller without any restrictions.

    Article 9: After a transaction is concluded, the entrusted broker shall fill out three copies of the transaction form, which shall be sealed by both the buyer and seller and the broker, and each shall keep one copy. The broker shall report the daily transaction situation statistically to the Exchange.

    Article 10: After a transaction is concluded, the buyer shall immediately pay a handling fee to the Exchange in cash. The amount is temporarily set at three per thousand of the total transaction value, which includes the remuneration due to the entrusted broker, and no other fees shall be charged.

    Article 11: After a transaction is concluded, the buyer shall present the transaction form and pay the seller for the goods on the same day. If the quality of the goods is found to be inconsistent or other disputes arise during pickup that cannot be resolved independently, the Exchange is responsible for mediation but is not responsible for compensating losses.

    Article 12: The Exchange has the right to send personnel to inspect and inquire about the relevant transaction accounts of brokers and those entering the Exchange for trading at any time.

    Article 13: Those entering the Exchange for trading, as well as brokers, must not engage in illegal activities such as buying and selling short, futures speculation, speculative profiteering, spreading rumors to inflate prices, or buying and selling counterfeit goods, or obtaining gains by trickery and fraud.

    Article 14: Those who violate the provisions of these rules may be subject to disciplinary action by the Exchange, such as cancellation or suspension of their eligibility to enter the Exchange. If the circumstances are serious, they will be sent to the competent authority for punishment.

    Article 15: Exchange staff shall not act as agents for others or conduct transactions for themselves.
