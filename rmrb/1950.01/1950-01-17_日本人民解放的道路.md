    Japanese imperialism was, and still is, an enemy of the Chinese people, but the Japanese people are friends of the Chinese people. The Japanese people and the Chinese people have a common enemy, and that is Japanese imperialism and its supporter, American imperialism. The Japanese people and the Chinese people have common friends, and that is the socialist Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the proletarians and oppressed nations of the world who are fighting against imperialism. The liberation of the Japanese people is a matter of great concern to the Chinese people.
    The Japanese people's struggle for liberation is currently in complex and difficult conditions. Like West Germany, Japan is being made by the American imperialist occupiers into a reactionary fortress against democracy, against socialism, and for planning new wars. For this counter-revolutionary purpose, the American occupiers want to preserve the forces of Japanese militarism, launch a brutal attack on the basic rights of the Japanese people, and colonize Japan.
    Under such conditions, the Japanese people must wage a resolute revolutionary struggle against American imperialism and Japanese reactionary forces in order to end the American occupation and the rule of the reactionaries as soon as possible, and to establish a democratic Japan. The vanguard of the Japanese revolutionary people, the Japanese Communist Party, must educate the people with a revolutionary spirit, unite the people, and revolutionize the people step by step, in order to truly achieve the goal of ending the American occupation, ending the reactionary rule, and establishing a democratic Japan. There is no easy path here.
    We have not seen many documents of the Japanese Communist Party. However, even judging from the few papers we have seen by Comrade Nosaka Sanzo, one of the leaders of the Japanese Communist Party (including the paper he wrote in 1949), we cannot help but think that they contain serious errors of principle. In his paper, Nosaka Sanzo tells the Japanese people that they can peacefully seize power by utilizing the bourgeois parliament, and makes an effort to prove that this judgment of his is possible under the conditions in Japan. Obviously, his argument is completely wrong. His propaganda cannot but create ideological confusion and misguided actions among the Japanese people and their advanced forces, and detract from the Japanese Communist Party's other revolutionary propaganda (such as opposing Japanese reactionary forces, defending the rights of workers, supporting socialism, and sympathizing with the Chinese revolution, etc.), which will inevitably harm the cause of the Japanese people and help the enemies of the Japanese people. Therefore, when we read the commentary "On the Situation in Japan" published on January 6 in the Cominform journal *For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy*, we thought that this gave the Japanese comrades a good opportunity to truly and strictly examine this error and thoroughly correct it.
    We are not yet very clear about the Japanese Communist Party's reaction to the Cominform journal's criticism. According to foreign news agencies, the Japanese Communist Party will convene a plenary session of the Central Committee in the near future to discuss the issues raised by the Cominform journal's criticism. This is very necessary. But foreign news agencies also say that the Central Political Bureau of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on January 12, stating that Nosaka's error "has been overcome," and that the Cominform journal's criticism "did not take into account" the situation of the Japanese Communist Party, and therefore disagreed with the conclusion of the criticism. Obviously, if this is true, then the Central Political Bureau of the Japanese Communist Party's understanding and attitude are incorrect and inappropriate. We feel very sorry. We hope that the upcoming plenary session of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party can have a correct understanding and change this attitude, so as to take appropriate steps to correct Nosaka's error.
    In any case, the Japanese Communist Party is now at a critical stage in its history. Every Communist who is loyal to Marxism-Leninism, loyal to the international communist movement, and loyal to the cause of the liberation of the Japanese people, must seek appropriate steps in order to unite under the correct political line, in order to adopt the correct methods of criticism and self-criticism, to help Comrade Nosaka Sanzo and other comrades with erroneous opinions to fully recognize and correct their own errors in practice, in order to establish the foundation for the sound development of the Japanese Communist Party in the future, and to overcome the danger of enemies and counter-revolutionaries taking advantage of the opportunity to sabotage and split the Japanese Communist Party. However, it should be admitted that Nosaka's error is not a simple, accidental error that can be corrected without effort. Under any conditions of bourgeois rule, let alone under the rule of American imperialism as it is today in Japan, the laboring people's struggle for power can only be a serious revolutionary struggle, in which the parliament can only be used as an auxiliary means, that is, as a platform for exposing the enemy. This fundamental position of Marxism-Leninism should never be modified for the sake of expediency in order to confuse the enemy. The current situation of the Japanese Communists is indeed serious (it is precisely this seriousness that Nosaka's paper underestimated, ignored, and glossed over), but any Bolshevik Communist in a serious environment should be very flexible in tactics, but should never relax his fundamental position in principle. On the contrary, he should adhere to principles in this serious environment, undergo tests, and thereby gain the trust of the people. If this position is violated, then the so-called attempt to confuse the enemy can only become the reality of confusing the people.
    The revolutionary party of the working class, or the leading figures of this party, cannot guarantee that they will not make mistakes at all. If they make mistakes, but do not insist on the mistakes when they are pointed out, and quickly and humbly correct them, then this party and its leaders will prove that they are loyal to the people, and will still maintain their prestige among the people. Otherwise, any of its prestige cannot be maintained, and is worthless. Such a rule has been proved countless times by the international working class revolutionary movement (including the Chinese revolutionary movement). The courage that the Japanese Communist Party has shown in fighting the enemy has been admired not only by the Japanese people but also by the Chinese people. From the standpoint of comrades, we earnestly hope that the Japanese Communist Party can show the same courage in accepting the criticism of the Cominform and correcting Nosaka's error. We believe that only in this way can the Japanese Communists answer the expectations of the Japanese people, answer the expectations of the Chinese and other Communist Parties, and also answer all the traps prepared by the imperialists for this purpose. May the Japanese Communist Party overcome obstacles and strive forward on the correct revolutionary road! May the cause of the liberation of the Japanese people achieve the final victory on the correct revolutionary road!

### 日本人民解放的道路

    日本人民解放的道路
    日本帝国主义曾经是并且现在仍然是中国人民的敌人，但是日本人民却是中国人民的朋友。日本人民和中国人民有共同的敌人，这就是日本帝国主义及其支持者美国帝国主义。日本人民和中国人民有共同的朋友，这就是社会主义的苏联，各人民民主国家，以及为反帝国主义而斗争的全世界的无产者和被压迫民族。日本人民的解放是中国人民所极为关怀的。
    日本人民的解放斗争现在正处在复杂的困难的条件之下。和西部德国一样，日本正在被美帝国主义的占领者制造成为反对民主、反对社会主义和策划新战争的反动堡垒。为着这个反革命目的，美国占领者要保存日本的军国主义势力，要向日本人民的基本权利举行残酷的进攻，并要使日本殖民地化。
    日本人民在这样的条件下，必须向美国帝国主义和日本反动势力进行坚决的革命的斗争，才能早日结束美国的占领和反动派的统治，才能建立民主的日本。日本革命人民的先锋队日本共产党，必须用革命精神来教育人民，团结人民，使人民一步一步地革命化，才能确实达到结束美国占领，结束反动统治和建立民主日本的目的。在这里，任何轻便的道路都是没有的。
    我们没有看到日本共产党的很多文献。但是即就我们所看到的日本共产党领导者之一野坂参三同志的少数论文（包括他在一九四九年所写的论文）来说，我们也不能不认为，其中是含有严重的原则错误的。野坂参三在他的论文中告诉日本人民可以利用资产阶级的议会和平地取得政权，并且努力企图证明他的这一个判断在日本的条件之下是可能的。很明显，他的这种论点是完全错误的。他进行这种宣传不能不在日本人民及其先进部队中造成思想上的混乱和行动上的迷误，并使日本共产党的其他革命宣传（例如关于反对日本反动势力，关于保卫劳动者权利，关于拥护社会主义，关于同情中国革命等等）为之减色，这就必然要危害日本的人民事业，而帮助了日本人民的敌人。因此，当我们读了共产党情报局刊物《争取持久和平，争取人民民主》在一月六日所发表的《关于日本的形势》的评论时，我们以为这给了日本同志们一个真正严格地检讨这种错误并加以彻底纠正的良好的机会。
    日本共产党对于情报局刊物的批评的反应如何，我们还不很明了。据外国通讯社的消息，日本共产党将在最近召集中央委员会的全体会议，讨论情报局刊物的批评所引起的问题。这是很必要的。但外国通讯社的消息又说，日本共产党中央政治局曾经在一月十二日发表声明，表示野坂的错误“已经被克服”，并且认为情报局刊物的批评是“没有考虑到”日本共产党的处境，因而不同意这篇批评论文的结论。很明显，如果这是确实的，日共中央政治局的这种了解和态度，就是不正确的而且是不妥当的。我们觉得十分惋惜。我们希望即将召开的日共中央全会能够有正确的了解，并改变这种态度，以便能够采取适当步骤纠正野坂的错误。
    无论如何，日本共产党现在正处在它的历史的一个紧要阶段。每一个忠实于马克思列宁主义、忠实于国际共产主义运动和日本人民解放事业的慎重而有远见的共产党人，必须寻求适当步骤，以便在正确的政治路线下团结一致，以便采取正确的批评和自我批评的方法，帮助野坂参三同志及其他抱有错误意见的同志在实际上完全认识和纠正自己的错误，以便建立今后日本共产党健全发展的基础，并克服敌人反革命分子利用时机来破坏和分裂日本共产党的危险。但是，应当承认，野坂的错误不是一个简单的、偶然发生的、可以毫不费力就能够纠正的错误。在任何资产阶级统治的条件之下，更不用说像今天日本这样在美国帝国主义的统治之下，劳动人民争取政权只能是一场严重的革命的斗争，在这场斗争中议会只能用来作为一个辅助的手段，即作为揭露敌人的讲坛。这个马克思列宁主义的根本立场，决不是为着迷惑敌人而可以采取某种权宜策略加以修改的。日本共产党人现时的处境诚然是严重的（正是野坂的论文低估了、无视了和粉饰了这种严重性），但是任何处在严重环境下的布尔塞维克式的共产党人，在策略上固然应该十分灵活，在原则上却不决应该因此而放松了自己的根本立场。相反的，应该在这种严重环境下坚持原则，经历考验，并且由此取得人民的信任。如果违背了这个立场，那么所谓迷惑敌人的企图，就只能变成为迷惑人民的实际。
    工人阶级的革命政党，或是这个政党的领导人物，都不能保证完全不犯错误。犯了错误，但是在被指出的时候不坚持错误，并且迅速地虚心地加以纠正，那么，这个政党和它的领导者就证明了自己是忠实于人民的，就将仍然在人民中间保持自己的威信。否则，它的任何威信都是不能保持的，而且是无价值的。这样一个规律，是国际工人阶级革命运动（包括中国革命运动）所无数次地证明了的。日本共产党在向敌人作战中所曾表现的勇敢，不但为日本人民而且为中国人民所钦佩。我们以同志的立场，热切地希望日本共产党能够在接受共产党情报局的批评和纠正野坂的错误时表现同样的勇敢。我们相信，只有这样，日本共产党人才能答复日本人民的期望，才能答复中国和各国共产党人的期望，也才能答复帝国主义者为此而准备的一切陷阱。愿日本共产党在正确的革命道路上克服障碍，努力前进！愿日本人民解放事业在正确的革命道路上获得最后的胜利！
