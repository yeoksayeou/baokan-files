    Six Shoe-Making Cooperatives in Beijing Establish Joint Association: Unified Purchase of Raw Materials and Promotion of Finished Products – Expected to Reduce Costs and Open Sales Channels
    [This newspaper dispatch] To improve production efficiency and strengthen purchasing, sales, and management, the six shoe-making production cooperatives in Beijing established the "Beijing Shoe-Making Cooperative Joint Association" on the 5th. Representatives were selected from each cooperative, one from every ten people, to convene a "Representative Assembly," which adopted the association's charter and elected seven directors and seven supervisors to form the board of directors and supervisors, serving as the unified management and administrative body. Last winter, various organizations ordered tens of thousands of pairs of cotton shoes, but because the machines and personnel of each cooperative were scattered, none could undertake the order alone, increasing difficulties for the ordering organizations. The result of separate orders was inconsistent specifications and uneven quality. Therefore, each cooperative had a demand for joint operations. After more than a month of deliberation and discussion, it was decided to establish a shoe-making cooperative joint association, stipulating that each cooperative would maintain economic and production independence, but would unify operations in terms of contracting work, unified processing, unified procurement of raw materials, and product specifications. In this way, competition among the same industries can be avoided, reducing intermediate exploitation and the burden on direct consumers, achieving the effect of reducing costs and opening up sales channels. The joint association's address has been selected at No. 8 Chuantangmen, Taipusi Street. There are currently 332 members, and it is planned to expand to 400 members in January, with a monthly production capacity of 735 pairs of leather shoes and 23,700 pairs of cloth shoes. In the future, any organizations, schools, or military units needing to order shoes can directly contact them.

    京市六家制鞋合作社成立联合社
    统一购买原料推销成品  可望减低成本打开销路
    【本报讯】北京的六个制鞋生产合作社，为了提高生产效率，加强购销和经营，于五日成立“北京市制鞋合作社联合社”。并从各社每十人中推代表一人召开“代表大会”，通过社章，选举了理监事各七人，成立理监事会，作为统一经营管理的机构。去冬各机关订棉鞋数万双，但各社因机器和人员分散谁也不能一下承包，给订鞋机关增加困难。分别包做的结果，发生了规格不一致，质量不齐的毛病。因而各社都有了联营的要求。经月余之酝酿讨论，决成立制鞋合作社联合社，规定各社在经济上和生产上还保持独立性，但在业务上统一包活，统一加工，统一原料的采购和产品的规格。这样一来，即可避免同业间的竞争现象，减低中间剥削和直接消费者的负担，收到降低成本打开销路的效果。联合社社址已择定太仆寺街穿堂门八号。现有社员三三二人，一月份打算发展到四百人，每月能产皮鞋七三五双，布鞋二三、七○○双。今后各机关、学校、部队需订鞋者，即可直接和他们联系。
