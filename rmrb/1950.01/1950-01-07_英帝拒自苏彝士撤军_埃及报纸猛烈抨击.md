Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th. Reuter, Cairo: The newspaper *Al-Mussawar* recently published an editorial fiercely attacking the rulers of Egypt. The newspaper pointed out that when British Foreign Secretary Bevin recently declared that Britain had no intention of withdrawing British troops from the Suez Canal area, "not one of the rulers" of Egypt "stirred from his seat." The newspaper, after pointing out that Bevin also said that the United States government supported the decision to keep British troops stationed in the canal area, asked: "What is Bevin thinking? Does he consider Egypt a part of the United States?" The editorial concluded by stating: The spirit of the Egyptian people is indestructible.

    【新华社北京六日电】电通社开罗讯：《艾尔·图特拉》报顷发表社论，猛烈攻击埃及的统治者。该报指出，当英外相贝文最近宣称英国无意从苏彝士运河地区撤退英军时，埃及的“统治者没有一个人从他的座位上动一动”。该报在指出贝文还说美国政府支持英军留驻运河地区的决定时问道：“贝文在想些什么？难道他把埃及算作美国的一部分？”社论末称：埃及人民的精神是不可消灭的。
