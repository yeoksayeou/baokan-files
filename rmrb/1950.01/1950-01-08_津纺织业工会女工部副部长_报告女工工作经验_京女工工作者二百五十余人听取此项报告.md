    Tianjin Textile Industry Union Women Workers' Department Deputy Director
    Reports on Women Workers' Experience
    250+ Beijing Women Workers Listen to Report
    [Beijing News] The Women Workers' Department of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee convened more than 250 women workers from various public and private factories throughout the city on the afternoon of the 5th to hear Wu Ke, Deputy Director of the Women Workers' Department of the Tianjin Textile Industry Union, report on the work of women workers in Tianjin. In her report, Wu Ke pointed out the following experiences: (1) First, it is necessary to understand the ideological situation of women workers, and to use the glorious deeds of advanced women to enlighten and educate them. For example, regularly tell them stories of working women in the Soviet Union and old liberated areas, etc. (2) Publicize the importance of women's work. Many people do not pay attention to women's work. We must use various meetings to ask leaders to explain the importance of women's work, which is more effective than women workers publicizing it themselves. (3) The Women Workers' Department must be closely integrated with the work of the Party, the League, and the trade union, and not isolate women's work; cadres at all levels of the Women Workers' Department must maintain close contact in order to exchange experiences at any time and achieve consistency in work. At the same time, she also talked about a deviation that occurred when they were training women cadres, that is, they only paid attention to training young women workers, while ignoring the middle-aged and older women workers with rich production knowledge and long years of service, which is a loss to the work.

    津纺织业工会女工部副部长
    报告女工工作经验
    京女工工作者二百五十余人听取此项报告
    【北京讯】北京市总工会筹委会女工部于五日下午召集全市各公私营工厂女工工作者二百五十余人，听取天津市纺织业工会女工部副部长吴克报告天津的女工工作情况。吴克在报告中指出下面几点经验：（一）首先要了解女工们的思想情况，要用先进妇女的光荣事例去启发和教育她们。如经常给她们讲述苏联和老解放区劳动妇女的故事等。（二）宣传女工工作的重要。许多人不重视女工工作，我们要利用各种会议请首长讲解女工工作的重要性，这比女工工作者自己宣传收效较大。（三）女工部须和党、团、工的工作密切结合，不要把女工工作孤立起来；各级女工部干部，尤须密切连系，以便随时交换经验，取得工作上的一致。同时，她并讲到她们在培养女工干部时所发生的一种偏向，即只注意培养青年女工，而忽略了生产知识丰富、工龄大的壮年和老年女工，这对工作是一个损失。
