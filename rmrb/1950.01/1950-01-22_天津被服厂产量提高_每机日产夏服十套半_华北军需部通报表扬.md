The North China Military Region Logistics Department, Military Supply Department, and Political Department issued a circular commending the Tianjin Clothing Factory for setting a new record of an average daily output of 10.52 summer uniforms per machine. After rectification and study last year, and the publicizing of the Party, the class consciousness of all employees in the factory has generally improved. After the summer uniform task began this year, although the uniform style was changed and the sewing was unfamiliar, after discussion among the employees, it was unanimously agreed that the standard requirement of 6.5 uniforms per machine per day could be achieved after proficiency. At the beginning of production, the leadership did not emphasize quantity, but only paid attention to product quality, allowing workers to try making uniforms according to the standard sample, starting with only one uniform issued per machine per day, and gradually increasing the number issued. Due to the high morale of the workers, production increased day by day. According to the statistics of the general factory, the average daily output per machine in each branch factory has increased from 2.85 sets at the beginning to 6.527 sets, and on the 12th of this month, it increased to 10.52 sets, and the product quality meets the specifications.

    天津被服厂产量提高
    每机日产夏服十套半
    华北军需部通报表扬
    【本报讯】华北军区后勤部军需部政治部通报表扬天津被服厂每机平均日产夏服十点五二套的新纪录。该厂经过去年整训学习、公开党等项运动之后，全体职工阶级觉悟普遍提高，今年夏服任务开工后，虽因服装制式改换、缝制生疏，但经过职工讨论，一致认为：只要熟练以后，每架机子日产六套半的标准要求是可以做到的。开工之初，领导上不强调数量，只注意产品质量，让工人按照标样实地试做，由每天每机只发一套作起，逐步增发。由于工人生产情绪高涨，产量日渐增加，据该总厂统计：各分厂每机日产平均量，已由开始时两套点八五增至六套点五二七，至本月十二日竟增至十套点五二，且产品质量合乎规格。
