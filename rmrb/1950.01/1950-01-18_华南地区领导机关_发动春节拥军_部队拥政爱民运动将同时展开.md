Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th -- The South China region has decided to launch a Spring Festival support-the-army and army-cherish-the-people movement. The South China Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, and the Political Department of the Guangdong Military Region jointly issued instructions on January 12 regarding the Spring Festival support-the-army and army-cherish-the-people movement, stipulating that February 1 to March 1 will be the support-the-army movement month. During this period, cadres at all levels of the Party, government, and people should hold discussions on supporting the army, giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers, supporting the front lines, and strengthening military-government and military-civilian relations. They should conduct a serious review from an ideological and practical work perspective and solicit the army's opinions on the work of the government and the masses. Each province, city, special commissioner's office, and county should establish a support-the-army committee to mobilize and lead the masses in carrying out activities such as supporting the army, comforting the army, and慰问 the families of martyrs and soldiers. In the week before and after the Spring Festival, a support-the-army conference can be held to extend Spring Festival greetings to nearby troops,慰问 the wounded and sick soldiers, and hold symposiums for military families. The army's army-cherish-the-people movement should be launched simultaneously, carrying out extensive education on army-cherish-the-people, calling on the entire army to produce and save, reduce the burden on the masses, overcome financial difficulties, and complete the task of liberating all of Guangdong; solicit opinions from Party, government, and people's representatives on the troops, inspect mass discipline, organize Spring Festival cultural and recreational activities and various forums, and hold joint celebrations with the local masses to strengthen military-civilian relations.
