Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 13th: Cultural and artistic workers in North China, East China, Northwest China, and other regions have universally responded to the call issued by the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government on December 21st of last year, launching New Year's mass literary and artistic activities to carry out propaganda and education work among the people, and laying the foundation for larger-scale Spring Festival (starting February 17th) literary and artistic activities.

	The Broad Masses of Workers, Soldiers, and Students Participate in Various Literary and Art Activities

New and old playwrights, singers, painters, and the broad masses of workers, soldiers, and students in various regions have all participated in the New Year's literary and artistic activities. The recreational activities of workers, soldiers, and students include various items such as Yangko dances, waist drum dances, dances, singing, acting, stilt walking, land boats, and holding sports meets, skating parties, lectures, and exhibitions. They have adapted stories and characters they are familiar with into plays, dance music, and New Year pictures. For example, workers at the Beijing Clothing Factory adapted the movement of the factory responding to thrift and opposing waste into the play "Two Thousand Bolts of Cloth"; the Shijingshan Power Plant wrote a play and a quick-rhythm piece respectively about the glorious example of Wang Wenbin, a worker at the plant, being promoted to deputy director and being elected as a member of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and about their own rush repairs of Machine No. 6. In addition, the play "One Unintelligible Concept" and "Red Lantern Dance" performed by the Xinhua Printing Factory, the play "New Year's Joy" performed by the Mentougou Coal Mine, and the small New Year pictures published by the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Art Society are all works of the workers themselves. On the military side, various units of the People's Liberation Army in North China and East China have universally launched the "Soldiers Acting for Soldiers" movement, that is, organizing commanders and fighters to use collective creation methods to write the most vivid examples they are familiar with in their military life into plays, and then perform them themselves for their own units to watch. Students in various regions have also carried out various literary and artistic activities. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Student Federation, students in Shanghai performed operas and songs reflecting new democratic studies and public bond propaganda during the New Year, which achieved great results.

	Drama Workers Hold New Drama Movement Week

The All-China Drama Workers Association launched a New Drama Movement Week from New Year's Eve to January 6th, mobilizing drama workers across the country. Various new and old forms of drama such as spoken drama, Peking Opera, Ping Opera, Yue Opera, drum ballad, quick rhythm, and Kun Opera participated in this movement. The capital's drama performances included spoken drama "Moscow Character," and new content in old forms of drama included Peking Opera "Against Suzhou," and Ping Opera "Liu Hulan," etc. The Tianjin drama circles adopted realistic themes and compiled and performed the new play "Yiguandao," exposing the various crimes of the reactionary sect Yiguandao. In addition to performing various new plays in the New Year, the Shanghai Municipal Government's Bureau of Culture and Art has also initiated a Shanghai Local Opera and Folk Art Spring Festival Singing Competition to summarize the transformation work of opera and folk art in Shanghai in the half year since liberation and to promote the reform of opera and folk art in 1950, so that various local operas and folk art can develop in the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and then establish permanent institutions for transforming opera and folk art, and unite and transform various old artists on the basis of the old drama reform movement. The Preparatory Committee for the Shanghai Spring Festival Singing Competition was established in mid-last month. Famous Peking Opera artists Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, famous Yue Opera artist Yuan Xuefen, as well as Huaiyang Opera, Jianghuai Opera, Shanghai Opera, Chang (Zhou) Xi (Wuxi) Opera, storytelling, ballad singing and other performing artists have been selected as preparatory committee members, and they will all participate in the singing competition at that time.

	Artists Actively Produce New Year Pictures

Artists have responded to the call of the Central People's Government on November 26th regarding the development of New Year picture work. Before the New Year, they gathered to discuss the content of their creations and publication issues. Some regions, such as Shanghai and Tianjin, have established New Year Picture Research Associations and New Year Picture Joint Publishing Houses respectively, and have created various New Year pictures reflecting the great victory of the people's revolutionary movement and the great construction work of the new China. The General Administration of Publications of the Central People's Government plans to print 2 million copies of New Year pictures. More than 40 types, totaling more than 1 million copies, including "Welcome Soviet Friends" and "Welcome Labor Heroes Home," have been sent to press before the New Year, and it is expected that the entire plan can be completed by the end of this month. Tianjin New Year pictures have always been popular in the vast rural areas of Shanxi, Shandong, Chahar, and other provinces. The New Year picture industry in the city had already formed the "Tianjin Painting Industry Joint Publishing House" at the end of last year, and was responsible for making plates and printing New Year pictures separately, preparing to print 12 types of New Year pictures. Eight types, including "Autumn Harvest" and "Raising Pigs and Cattle, Big Profits," were published on the eve of the Gregorian New Year. More than 30 painters in Shanghai participated in the creation of New Year pictures, and more than 30 types have now been published, including "Celebrating the Founding of the People's Republic of China," "Chairman Mao Calls on the Troops to Participate in Production," and supporting the issuance of People's Victory Bonds. Shanghai has also compiled and distributed many calendar cards and monthly cards with new content. In order to adapt to the folk custom of hanging and posting auspicious couplets during the Spring Festival, the Shanghai Municipal Government's Bureau of Culture and Art, together with the Writers' Association, the Education Federation, and the Federation of Trade Unions, jointly launched a new Spring Couplet creation movement. By the beginning of this month, more than 7,500 works have been received, and they are currently being reviewed and edited. In addition, the Hangzhou art circles have also created more than 30 New Year pictures such as "Democratic Anti-Hegemony Great Turnaround" and "Children Offer Flowers to Chairman Mao." The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Writers' Association has printed "Victory of the War of Liberation" and various New Year pictures related to production movements and cultural construction. New Year pictures have been published in Southern Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi and other places, and are universally welcomed by the broad masses of the people.

    【新华社北京十三日电】华北、华东、西北等地的文化艺术工作者，已普遍响应中央人民政府文化、教育两部于去年十二月二十一日发出的号召，开展了新年的群众文艺活动，向人民群众进行了宣传教育工作，并为春节（二月十七日起）更大规模的文艺活动打下了基础。
            广大工人战士学生参加了各种文艺活动
    各地的新旧剧作家、演唱家、画家和广大的工人、战士和学生都参加了新年的文艺活动。工人战士和学生们的文娱活动，包括秧歌、腰鼓、舞蹈、唱歌、演戏、高跷、旱船及举办运动会、溜冰会、讲演会、展览会等各种项目。他们把自己所熟悉的故事和人物编成剧本、舞曲和年画。如北京被服厂的工人将该厂响应节约、反对浪费的运动编出剧本《两千匹布》；石景山发电厂将该厂工人王文斌被提拔为副厂长并被选为北京市人民政府委员的光荣典范和他们自己抢修第六号机器的情形分别写成剧本和快板。此外，如新华印刷厂演出的《搞不通的观念之一》、《红灯舞》，门头沟煤矿演出的《新年欢》，石景山钢铁厂美术社出版的小型年画等都是工人自己的作品。部队方面，华北、华东解放军各部队普遍展开了“兵演兵”运动，即组织指战员们，用集体创作的方法，将他们所熟悉的、部队生活中最生动的事例编写成戏，又由自己来演出，给自己的部队看。各地学生也进行了各种文艺活动。上海学生在该市学联的领导下，在新年演出了反映新民主主义学习及宣传公债的剧曲，获得了很大的成绩。
            戏剧工作者举行新戏剧运动周
    中华全国戏剧工作者协会，曾于去年十二月下旬，发动全国戏剧工作者，自除夕至一月六日举行新戏剧运动周。话剧、京剧、评戏、越剧、大鼓、快板、崐腔等各种新旧形式的戏剧，都参加这个运动。首都戏剧的演出，话剧有《莫斯科性格》，新内容旧形式的戏剧有京剧《反苏州》、评戏《刘胡兰》等。天津戏剧界采用现实题材，编演新戏《一贯道》，暴露反动教门一贯道的诸种罪恶。上海除在新年演出各种新戏外，市政府文艺处并已发起一个上海市地方戏曲曲艺春节演唱大竞赛，借以总结上海市解放半年来戏曲曲艺的改造工作和推进一九五○年戏曲曲艺的改革，使各种地方性的戏曲曲艺均能向为工农兵服务的方向发展，并进而成立改造戏曲曲艺的经常机构，在旧剧改革运动的基础上，团结和改造各种旧艺人。上海市春节演唱大竞赛筹委会已于上月中旬成立，名京剧家梅兰芳、周信芳、名越剧家袁雪芬以及淮扬剧、江淮剧、沪剧、常（州）锡（无锡）文戏、快书、弹词等各种演唱艺人，均被选为筹备委员，届时他们都将参加演唱竞赛。
            美术家踊跃制作新年画
    美术家们则已响应年前十一月二十六日中央人民政府关于开展年画工作的号召，在新年前即纷纷集会座谈创作内容和出版问题。有的地区，如上海、天津，已分别成立年画研究会和年画联合出版社，创作了反映人民革命运动的伟大胜利和新中国伟大建设工作的各种年画。中央人民政府出版总署预定印行年画二百万份，年前已付印者有《欢迎苏联朋友》、《欢迎劳动英雄归来》等四十余种，共一百余万份，预计本月底可以完成全部计划。天津年画一向畅销山西、山东、察哈尔等省广大农村。该市年画业早在去年底即已合组《天津画业联合出版社》，分别负责制版和印刷年画，准备印制年画十二种，公历新年前夕已出版《秋收》、《养猪喂牛、一本万利》等八种。上海有三十余位画家参加新年画的创作，现亦已出版三十余种，内容有《庆祝中华人民共和国成立》、《毛主席号召部队参加生产》以及拥护发行人民胜利公债等。上海市并且编制和发行了许多富有新内容的日历牌和月份牌。为适应民间喜在春节悬挂和张贴吉庆联语的习俗，上海市府文艺处并曾与文协、教联、总工会等联合发起创作新春联运动，至本月初止已收到七千五百余幅，现正审查编辑中。此外，杭州美术界亦创作了新年画《民主反霸大翻身》、《儿童献花给毛主席》等三十多幅。陕北文协已印出《解放战争胜利》和有关生产运动及文化建设的各种新年画。苏南、河南、河北、平原、山西等地均有新年画出版，普遍受到广大人民的欢迎。
