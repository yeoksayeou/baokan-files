    The Beijing Business and Industrial Circles Public Bond Promotion Branch convened a meeting yesterday afternoon for over twenty cadres from agencies like the Commercial Bureau who are assisting various industries in conducting inspections and mobilizations to report on their work. Reports from each group indicated that Beijing's business and industrial circles have basically completed their subscription tasks. The grain store industry, rice and flour industry, and dried and fresh fruit industry performed particularly well. The main reason is that the promotion branch committees of each industry were proactive and adopted democratic methods. For example, Tian Kuoting and Yao Wenhui, the promotion committee members of the grain store industry, conducted detailed investigations of each household and held two days of meetings. Industry groups conducted democratic evaluations and thorough discussions, unanimously agreeing to allocate subscriptions based on each household's financial strength: those with greater strength would subscribe more, and those with less strength would subscribe less. They opposed egalitarianism based solely on tax points. Because they truly promoted democracy, they smoothly completed the subscription task of 45,000 shares, and each household was satisfied. The rice and flour industry also completed the assigned task of subscribing 170,000 shares on time, thanks to the proactive efforts and leadership of its responsible persons. The reports also reflected that the lack of proactiveness or insufficient understanding of public bond promotion by the responsible persons in individual industries had affected the overall public bond promotion in those industries. The meeting unanimously agreed that mobilizing key industries and key households, and calling on large households to take the lead in subscribing, was the best approach. In addition, a work plan for next week was set: to further understand the subscription situation and, while the distribution has been basically completed, to listen to the feedback from various industries on whether it is fair and reasonable; to pay attention to discovering activists in the promotion work and commend them in a timely manner; and to pay attention to the situation after the burden is borne, as some businesses that are unclear about the policy are considering taking the opportunity to close down.

    京工商界完成认购公债的经验
    【本报讯】北京市工商界推销公债分会昨日下午召集协助各行业进行检查动员的商业局等机关干部二十余人汇报工作。从各组汇报中反映出北京市工商界已基本上完成了认购的任务，其中尤以粮栈业、米面粮业、干鲜果业做得最好。主要原因是各该行业推销分会委员积极负责并采取了民主方式。如粮栈业推销委员田阔亭、姚文辉，他们认真地把每户都做了详细的调查，开了两天会，同业小组进行了民主评议和充分讨论，一致同意按各户实力负担：力量大的多认购，力量小的少认购。他们反对完全根据税分做标准的平均主义。由于他们真正的发扬了民主，顺利的完成了四万五千分的认购任务，且各户都感到满意。米面粮业也由于负责人的积极努力和带头，而按期完成了分配十七万分的任务。汇报反映也有个别行业由于负责人不够积极认真或对推销公债认识不够而影响了整个行业公债的推销。会上一致认为按照重点行业、重点户进行动员，号召大户带头认购是最好的办法。此外，并订出了下星期工作计划：进一步了解认购情况，这次分配虽然基本完成，但是否公平合理还应听取各行业反映，注意发现在推销工作中的积极分子，及时表扬；注意负担后的情况如何，有些不明了政策的商号，想乘机歇业。
