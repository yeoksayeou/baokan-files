    "The Fifties"
    Song Yunbin
    We often like to use terms in our daily conversations or writing. However, when using terms, we must have a clear understanding of them, otherwise, we will make a fool of ourselves. Let me tell you a story.
    In 1940, I was in Guilin. That year, the New Year's Day issue of the *National Salvation Daily* published an article like "New Year's Musings," which began by saying: "This year is 1940, already in the fifties of the twentieth century." That evening, we had a small dinner party, and the author of "New Year's Musings" was also present. Everyone praised his article, and a Mr. Zhang interjected, saying, "The article is indeed well-written, but the decade is wrong. This year is the beginning of the forties of the twentieth century!" Everyone was stunned at the time, not expecting there to be a problem with this statement. Some even said that perhaps Mr. Zhang was wrong. After the banquet, we went back to check books, including things like the *Encyclopedia Britannica*, and only then did we clarify the issue. It was indeed the author who was wrong.
    In fact, it's not just that author who got the decade wrong. We usually don't pay attention to this issue. In that year, a new publishing house established in Chongqing was called "The Fifties," which shows that the general public had not figured out this issue.
    I often remember this small incident. Whenever I write an article and need to use a term, I always think, do I truly understand this term? If I still feel somewhat vague, I dare not use it.
    Because I often remember this small incident, I was recently reading the *History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)* and was reminded of something. In the first chapter of the Party History, the terms "eighties" and "seventies" are used more than once, and there is a passage that reads:
    "There were many strikes in the eighties. Within five years (1881 to 1886), there were more than forty-eight strikes."
    The "eighties" mentioned here refers to the eighties of the nineteenth century, and it clearly states that the so-called "eighties" refers to the period from 1880 to 1889. When I was in Guilin, I also had a copy of the *History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)* and often flipped through it. Why didn't I use this passage as proof at the time and instead let my friends look up the *Encyclopedia Britannica*? This proves that we (not just me) are usually really "careless" when reading.
    Time passes quickly, and this year is truly the beginning of the fifties of the twentieth century. I am specifically telling this story to warn myself and encourage my friends, hoping that everyone will read diligently and learn humbly.

### “五十年代”

    “五十年代”
    宋云彬
    我们平时谈话或写文章往往喜欢引用术语。可是引用术语必须对于这个术语明白了解，否则就要闹笑话。让我讲个故事。
    一九四○年我在桂林。那年元旦的《救亡日报》上登载一篇《新年随笔》之类的文章，开头就说：“今年是一九四○年，已经是二十世纪五十年代了。”当天晚上我们有个小小聚餐会，“新年随笔”的作者也在座，大家称赞他的文章写得好，有一位张先生插嘴说：“文章固然写得不错，可是年代说错了，今年是二十世纪四十年代的开头哇！”当时大家都一楞，想不到这一句话会有问题，有的还说恐怕倒是张先生说错了。宴会散后，我们回去查书，查了《大英百科全书》之类，才把这个问题搞清楚，的确是那位作者说错了。
    其实把年代说错的岂止那位作者，我们平时都没有注意这个问题。在那一年，重庆新成立的一个出版社就叫做“五十年代”，可见一般人对于这个问题都没有搞清楚。
    这一件小事我常常记起，每逢写文章要引用术语的时候，总想一想，这个术语我是不是真真了解呢，如果还觉得有些模糊的话，就不敢引用。
    因为常常记着这件小事，最近读“联共（布）党史”，又引起我一点感触。在党史的第一章里，不止一次的用“八十年代”“七十年代”字样，并且有这样一段文字：
    “八十年代发生过很多次的罢工，在五年以内（一八八一至一八八六）就发生过四十八次以上的罢工。”
    这里所说的“八十年代”是十九世纪八十年代，而且很明白的说明了所谓“八十年代”是指一八八○年到一八八九年这一个时期。我在桂林的时候，手头也有一本《联共（布）党史》，而且常常在翻看，当时何以不拿这一段文字来作证明，而要让朋友们去翻查《大英百科全书》呢？这就证明了我们（不止我一个人）平时读书实在“马虎”得可以。
    时间过得很快，今年真正是二十世纪五十年代的开头了。我特地把这个故事讲出来，警惕自己，勉励朋友，愿大家认真读书，虚心学习。
