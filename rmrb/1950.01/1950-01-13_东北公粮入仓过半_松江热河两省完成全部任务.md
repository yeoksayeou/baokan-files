Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 11th: The grain requisition work in Northeast China is progressing rapidly. As of late December last year, the grain stored has reached more than half of the total requisition task. Songjiang and Rehe provinces, which delivered grain earlier, had completed all tasks by mid-December and are currently undergoing rectification and storage. Liaoxi Province had completed about 70% of its total public grain task by mid-December. Heilongjiang Province began delivering grain in late November and had completed over 60% by the end of December, with the quality meeting the prescribed standards. Last year's grain requisition method was based on the assessment and collection of standard yields per unit area based on long-term averages. However, due to widespread disasters in various regions between summer and autumn, the pressing issues for governments at all levels are how to accurately grasp the disaster situation and actual yields of the year, and further understand the quality of the grain, so as to ensure that farmers' burdens are fair and reasonable, while also ensuring that state revenue is not lost.

	During the grain requisition arrangement, in-depth assessment of disaster conditions, adjustment of land grades, and investigation of unreported land relatively reduced the burden on farmers.

	To this end, all provinces emphasized conducting in-depth assessments of disaster conditions, adjusting land grades, and investigating "black land" (i.e., concealed and unreported cultivated land) during the grain requisition arrangement. In late August, the Liaoxi Provincial Government had many responsible cadres leading work teams deep into disaster areas, conducting assessments of land yields while promoting flood prevention and production disaster relief. Each county conducted typical investigations, and many districts and villages actively united all farmers to conduct assessments of harvests by village cadres and peasant activists. The Jilin Provincial Government Grain Bureau also dispatched more than 180 cadres to various counties in August to cooperate in disaster investigation and actual yield investigation, while conducting moisture testing to understand the quality of the grain. In Liaodong Province, many counties discovered a total of more than 66,000 mu of concealed land during the autumn requisition process, according to incomplete statistics; in Jinxi County, Liaoxi Province alone, farmers automatically reported more than 5,000 mu of "black land." In the in-depth assessment of disaster conditions and harvest assessment, some disaster-stricken areas reported less damage than originally reported, and the harvest was also greater than originally reported. Some areas also reasonably changed the unreasonable phenomenon that the previously established land standard yields were generally lower than the actual yields, and re-adjusted land grades.

	Due to the correct implementation of the reasonable burden policy, farmers everywhere have universally launched a campaign to deliver good grain.

	All of these measures have relatively reduced the burden on most farmers. For example, the public grain in most areas of Rehe Province this year is lighter than last year, with the highest not exceeding 20%, while counties such as Beipiao and Chaoyang are only slightly above 10%. Due to the correct implementation of the fair and reasonable burden policy and the improvement of farmers' political awareness everywhere, the slogan "Love the New China, support Chairman Mao" has become a common grain delivery slogan in rural areas, and the movement to deliver good grain has rapidly expanded. Therefore, the general quality of the grain received by the state is above medium (94% purity). When the autumn requisition began, Heilongjiang Province issued a call to deliver top-quality grain, and then successively issued urgent telegrams and circulars insisting on quality standards and rewarding the early delivery of top-quality public grain. The Director of the Provincial Government Finance Department and the Director of the Grain Bureau personally went to various places to inspect the quality, and the persons in charge of each county also led cadres to the countryside to help with the work. Therefore, responding to the call to deliver top-quality grain became the actual action of 4.5 million farmers in the province. In Hailun County, the province alone, more than 23 million catties of top-quality public grain were delivered in the first ten days of December, accounting for more than 27% of the county's total public grain task. Since early December, the province has been able to receive more than 20,000 tons of top-quality public grain every day. Although Rehe Province suffered severe disasters this year, the quality of millet in the public grain has also greatly improved compared to last year. In Liaoxi Province, after correcting the purely task-oriented viewpoint in some places, the movement to deliver good grain has also been launched.

	Thorough organization and detailed planning were carried out before grain delivery and receipt; procedures were simplified and efficiency was improved.

	The close connection between grain delivery and receipt after the start of grain requisition in many areas is also one of the reasons for the rapid progress of grain requisition work. When grain delivery entered a concentrated phase in mid-December, it reached more than 30,000 vehicles (up to 70,000 at its peak), more than 300,000 horses, and 100,000 to 150,000 grain delivery farmers every day. In order to unfold and cooperate with this large-scale and intense grain delivery upsurge and facilitate early storage, most regions have made thorough organization and detailed plans for grain delivery and receipt in advance. Therefore, the order of grain delivery is good and the reception is fast. For example, Liaoxi Province adopted the method of combining organized transportation and reception, implementing fixed quotas and quantities according to the daily reception capacity of each warehouse, allowing only exceeding and not reducing; each county and district also generally organized grain delivery teams with one or several villages as units, and transported them in a planned manner according to the variety of public grain, which greatly improved the reception efficiency and reduced the phenomenon of farmers wasting time, suffering from hunger and cold on the way to deliver grain. Rehe Province changed the method of direct grain delivery to the warehouse by households last year. This year, it took the village as a unit to appropriately allocate the amount of grain to be transported according to the labor force of people and animals, and then the farmers voluntarily combined, exchanged labor for people and vehicles, formed a public grain transportation team, and uniformly inspected and transported the grain. The grain collection stations also paid attention to simplifying the grain collection procedures, which also reduced a lot of trouble for the farmers.

    东北公粮入仓过半
    松江热河两省完成全部任务
    各地急应注意正确掌握灾害情况及常年实际产量，做到一面使农民负担公平合理，同时保证国家收入不受损失。
    【新华社沈阳十一日电】东北各地征粮工作进展迅速；截至去年十二月下旬止，入仓粮食已达征粮总任务半数以上。交粮较早的松江及热河两省，早于十二月中旬以后即已全部完成任务，目前正在整顿、保管中。辽西省于十二月中旬已完成全部公粮的百分之七十左右。黑龙江省自十一月下旬开始送粮，至十二月底止，亦已完成百分之六十以上，质量均符合规定标准。去年征粮办法是按照土地常年标准产量评等征收，但由于各地夏秋之间普遍遭受各种灾害，因此如何正确掌握灾害情况及当年实际产量，并进一步了解粮食质量，做到一方面使农民负担公平合理，另方面又保证国家收入不受损失，乃是各级人民政府所亟应注意的问题。
    布置征粮中深入评议灾情、调整地级、查黑地，农民负担相对减轻。
    为此，各省在布置征粮中，均强调进行深入评议灾情、调整地级和查黑地（即隐瞒未报的耕地）等工作。辽西省府在八月下旬即有不少负责干部带领工作组深入灾区，在推动防汛、生产救灾中进行了评土地产量；各县均作了典型调查，不少区村更由村干部及农民积极分子团结全体农民进行评议收成。吉林省政府粮食局亦在八月间派出干部一百八十余人分赴各县，配合进行灾害调查及实际产量调查，同时进行水分检验，借以了解粮食质量。辽东省有许多县在布置秋征过程中，据不完全统计共查出了匿报土地达六万六千余亩；辽西省仅锦西一县农民即自动报出黑地五千余亩。在深入评灾情评收成中，有些受灾地区比原报减少，年成亦比原报增加；若干地区又合理地改变了过去所订土地标准产量一般都低于实际产量的不合理现象，重新调整土地等级。
    由于正确执行合理负担政策，各地农民普遍掀起交好粮运动
    凡此种种，都使大多数农民相对地减轻了负担。如热河省绝大部分地区今年公粮都较去年为轻，最高不超过百分之二十，北票、朝阳等县则仅为百分之十强。各地由于正确地执行了公平合理的负担政策及农民政治觉悟的提高，“热爱新中国，拥护毛主席”的口号已普遍成为农村中的缴粮口号，交纳好粮的运动也迅速扩展，因之国家所收的粮食一般质量均在中等（纯度百分之九十四）以上。黑龙江省当秋征开始时，即发出交纳上等粮的号召，其后又接连发布坚持质量标准的紧急电示和奖励提前交纳上等公粮的通令。省府财政厅长、粮食局长都亲赴各地检查质量，各县负责人亦均率领干部下乡帮助工作，因此响应交纳上等粮的号召，变成全省四百五十万农民的实际行动。该省海伦县仅在十二月份上旬内即送交上等公粮二千三百余万斤，约占该县公粮总任务的百分之二十七以上。全省自十二月上旬以来，每天均可接收上等公粮两万吨以上。热河省今年虽遭严重灾害，但公粮中小米之质量亦较去年大为提高。辽西省在纠正某些地方的单纯任务观点后，交好粮运动亦已开展。
            送粮收粮事前作了周密组织详细计划手续简化效率提高
    许多地区在征粮开始后由于注意了送粮与收粮工作的密切联系，亦是征粮工作迅速进展的原因之一，十二月中旬各地送粮进入突击阶段时，每日曾达三万多辆（最高达七万辆）大车、三十多万匹马和十万至十五万送粮农民。为展开与配合这一大规模的紧张送粮热潮，以便提早入仓，大部地区在事前对送粮与收粮工作，均作了周密组织与详细计划。因此使送粮秩序良好，接收亦快。如辽西省采取有组织的运输与接收结合的办法，按每个仓库每天接收能力，实行定额定量，只准超过不准降低；各县区亦普遍以一村或数村为单位组织送粮队，并按公粮品种分类有计划的运送，这样就使接收效率大为提高，又减少了农民在送粮途中耽误时间、挨饿受冻的现象。热河省各地改变了去年以户为单位直接送粮入库的办法，今年以村为单位，按照人畜力适当分配运粮数量，再由农民自愿结合，人、车换工，组成公粮运输队，统一检查运送。收粮站并注意了简化收粮手续，亦为农民减去了不少麻烦。
