Xinhua News Agency, Beijing: The People's Liberation Army in North China and East China has universally launched the "Soldiers Acting as Soldiers" movement. As a form of self-education for soldiers, it plays a significant role in promoting various aspects of the troops' development. "Soldiers Acting as Soldiers" involves organizing commanders and fighters to collectively create plays based on familiar, vivid examples from their lives in the military. They then perform these plays for their own troops. As early as 1947, a type of rhythmic poetry called "Shunkouliu" (doggerel) became popular among soldiers in the North China Liberation Army. Soldiers would compose rhyming short poems about stories or characters from their military lives, which were very well-received. Later, around the time of the Qingfengdian Campaign in the same year, individual companies in a certain unit further developed the quick-rhyme format into short plays that depicted the exemplary deeds of their company. Based on real people and events, the performances were realistic, concise, and lively. Accompanied by gongs and drums, they were even more popular among the soldiers, who gave these plays the name "Soldiers Acting as Soldiers." Subsequently, "Soldiers Acting as Soldiers" was universally launched throughout the army. In February 1948, the military leadership summarized this mass-based initiative, explicitly pointing out that "Soldiers Acting as Soldiers" was a mass-based political activity and an excellent method of self-education and artistic activity for the masses to improve themselves. Thanks to the attention and promotion of leadership at all levels, the form and content of "Soldiers Acting as Soldiers" gradually improved. Initially, it only praised models and criticized backwardness. Later, it developed to include tactical movements and policy education, powerfully assisting companies in completing central tasks and combat missions. When learning policies, some companies performed plays like "Fair Trade" and "Mutual Aid Groups," enabling soldiers to more deeply understand the importance of discipline and policy. When a certain company conducted speak bitterness education, it dramatized the story of meritorious soldier Luo Kunhua, who suffered hardships in a landlord's home from childhood, was later captured by bandit troops and subjected to beatings and scoldings, and after liberation, joined the PLA and rendered meritorious service. Many soldiers were moved to tears. Some soldiers said, "This is better than a class; we understand why we are fighting!" During winter military training the year before last, a company performed "Tian Jiecun's Meritorious Grenade Throwing." After watching it, soldier Shi Zhuzi practiced grenade throwing outside the village every day, saying, "I want to surpass Tian Jiecun and get on the stage." Soldiers had a common saying: "Whoever is a model, let them be on the stage; whoever has shortcomings and doesn't change, let's act them out and make them correct." Currently, 106 companies in a certain army have adopted the "Soldiers Acting as Soldiers" method, which has become a very good working method for promoting military training, production, and cultural learning. Several professional theater troupes in the PLA have also found many realistic and valuable materials from the "Soldiers Acting as Soldiers" in the companies.

The East China Military Region also launched the "Soldiers Acting as Soldiers" movement during the New Year holidays. Soldiers from a certain company who were liberated during the Huaihai Campaign collectively created the script for "Year by Year," which they performed themselves, comparing the suffering of being besieged in Huaihai the year before last with the bright and happy life after liberation. A certain regiment of the Shanghai Garrison Command created the "Great PLA Dance" with 30 to 40 people based on the actual combat actions of the troops charging into battle. A certain artillery company in Nanjing created the "Artillery Drill Dance" based on artillery movements. These were extremely popular among the soldiers and had great educational significance.

    华北华东各部队开展兵演兵运动
    发挥群众创造自己教育自己
    推进练兵、生产和文化学习
    【新华社北京电】华北、华东解放军各部队中，普遍开展“兵演兵”运动，作为战士自我教育方式的一种，对推进部队各项建设工作起很大的作用。兵演兵是组织指战员们，用集体创作的方法，将他们所熟悉的，部队生活中最生动的事例编写成戏，又由自己来演出，给自己的部队看。远在一九四七年，华北解放军战士中间流行一种快板诗，叫“顺口溜”，战士把部队生活中的故事或人物编成押韵的短诗来唱，很受欢迎。后来在同年的清风店战役前后，某部个别连队，进一步用快板形式将本连的模范事迹编成小戏演出，真人真事，演来逼真，简短活泼，配上锣鼓，更受战士们的欢迎，战士们给这种戏取了个名字：“兵演兵”。以后“兵演兵”就在全军普遍展开。一九四八年二月该军领导机关总结了这一群众性的创造，明确指出“兵演兵”是群众性的政治工作，也是群众性的提高自己的自我教育和文艺活动很好的一种方法。由于各级领导机关的重视提倡，“兵演兵”的形式与内容逐步提高，原来只是表扬模范批评落后，后来发展到以战术动作和政策教育为内容，有力地帮助了各连队完成中心工作和战斗任务。有些连队在学习政策时，演出“买卖公平”“互助组”，使战士们更深刻地理解纪律、政策的重要性。某连进行诉苦教育时，把功臣罗坤华自小在地主家受苦，后来被匪军抓去当兵，挨打受骂，解放后参加解放军立功的故事编戏演出，许多战士都被感动得哭了，有些战士说：“这比上课强，咱弄清为啥打仗了！”前年冬季练兵，某连演出“田介臣投弹立功”，战士石柱子看后每天到村外练习投弹，他说：“我要超过田介臣，让我上戏。”战士们有一种普遍的说法：“谁模范，就让人家上上戏；谁有缺点老不改，就演演他，让他改正。”现在某军有一百零六个连队采取了“兵演兵”的方法，成为推进练兵、生产和文化学习的一种很好工作方法。解放军中的若干专业剧社也从连队“兵演兵”中找到很多现实的宝贵材料。
    华东军区各部在年节也展开了“兵演兵”运动。某连在淮海战役中解放的战士集体创作了“年比年”的剧本，由他们自己演出，把前年在淮海被围的苦况和解放后的光明幸福的生活作比较。上海警卫部队某团以部队冲锋作战的实际动作编成一个三十人至四十人的《大解放军舞》，南京某炮兵连以炮兵动作编成《炮操舞》，极为战士们所喜爱，而且有很大的教育意义。
