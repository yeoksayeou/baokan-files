    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 16th: The takeover of Chongqing's public enterprises, which has lasted for over a month, was initially completed on the 13th of this month. The Industry Department of the Chongqing Municipal Financial and Economic Takeover Committee has successively taken over units formerly under the pseudo-Resources Committee, such as electrical engineering, chemical industry, and petroleum exploration, as well as eight ordnance factories formerly under the pseudo-Ordnance Department. Among them, the ordnance factories are the largest in scale, with 33,300 employees. In terms of light industry, the Yu Feng Textile Mill and the Central Paper Mill were taken over. The former has 70,000 spindles and equipment for manufacturing 4,000 spindles per year, while the latter produces 4,000 reams of drawing paper and banknote/security paper per month. Among these taken-over factories, except for the Yu Feng Textile Mill, which has never stopped production, other small factories have now resumed work, and the Central Paper Mill and steel production departments are preparing to resume work. In addition, the logistics departments takeover committee has taken over various organizations of the pseudo-Joint Logistics system, including: printing factories, grain and fodder factories, woolen fabric factories, dyeing and finishing factories, automobile repair factories, tire retreading factories, ship repair yards, and telecommunications machinery repair and manufacturing factories, as well as warehouses for machinery, grain and fodder, ordnance, etc. Most of these factories have resumed production.
