    Overview of the Initial Stage of the Winter Literacy Campaign in North China
    Kan Shejun
            I. The Progress of the Winter Literacy Campaign
    The winter literacy campaign in North China generally began in the second half of November last year. After more than a month of development, its scale is not only more widespread than the 1948 winter literacy campaign, but the masses' learning achievements are also very significant. According to incomplete statistics from the initial stage of the winter literacy campaign, in 3,469 administrative villages in 14 counties including Xingtang in Hebei Province, winter schools were opened in 2,512 villages, accounting for 72 percent of the total number of villages. Xingtang County had the highest percentage at 94 percent, while Shenze County had the lowest at 43 percent. 152,463 people participated in the learning, including 54,812 women. According to statistics from eight counties including Li County, 67,736 young people enrolled. Compared to 1948, when Boye County in the Central Hebei Zhao County area and 13 other counties (cities) had the most winter schools, accounting for only 80 percent of the county's villages, while Wenxin County, the least, accounted for only 11 percent of the county's villages, the number of winter schools has clearly increased.
    In 17 counties including Licheng in Shanxi Province, 4,558 winter schools have been opened in 2,240 administrative villages, with an average of more than two schools per administrative village, exceeding the original plan of an average of one and a half schools per administrative village. Compared to 1.21 winter schools per administrative village in 25 counties (cities) including Zuoquan in Taihang in 1948, it is even more developed. According to statistics from 19 counties including Xiyang, Licheng, and Jiang County, 74,792 young men and women participated in youth cultural supplementary classes. In 15 villages including Tongtan Village in Zuoquan County, 98 percent of young people joined youth supplementary classes.
    As winter schools opened successively in various places, both cultural and political education achieved good results in a short period of time.
    Partial statistics from Pingyuan Province show that there are currently 2,785 winter schools with 28,590 male and female students. In Qingping County alone, winter schools have opened in 148 villages, with an enrollment of 12,088 people.
    In the Yanbei and Chanan special districts of Chahar Province, 1,651 winter schools have been opened, with 65,474 male and female students. In Zhangjiakou and Datong, there are already 65 people's schools with 3,360 students enrolled.
    Since the complete liberation of Suiyuan Province was later, only the ten counties in eastern Suiyuan have been arranging the winter literacy campaign. According to statistics from five counties, Fengzhen, Jining, Wudong, Taolin, and Xinghe, 116 winter schools have been established, with more than 3,000 men and women enrolled.
    The winter schools in the suburbs of Beijing are conducted in conjunction with land reform. In the 286 administrative units under its jurisdiction, including streets, towns, and administrative villages, 351 classes of winter schools have been opened, with 13,551 people participating in the learning. Women who have never had the opportunity to learn are now enrolling one after another. Taking the 19th district as an example, 1,366 women have participated in the learning, accounting for 48.5 percent of the total number of students in the district.
    After the winter schools opened, many areas mobilized the masses to conduct democratic class assignments, group divisions, formulate class schedules and individual learning plans, discuss learning conventions, and establish systems for requesting leave and examinations. Both political education and cultural learning have achieved considerable success. For example, in Banzhuang Village in Fangshan County, Shanxi Province, many young people learned more than 40 new characters in two weeks, averaging three characters per day. Li Tianxi, who did not know a single character, has never missed a class since the beginning of the school year and has now learned 57 characters. Students in Zhongzhuang Village in Licheng have all learned to sing the national anthem. In Antaizhuang Village in Xinle County, Hebei Province, among more than 40 students, many have learned more than 300 characters, and even the least have learned 40 new characters. The majority of winter schools in various places have coordinated with central work and carried out policy education, which has also promoted the central work. In Beiguan, Jiaocheng, Shanxi Province, the benefits of accumulating manure were discussed in the winter school, and the manure accumulation campaign in the whole street quickly unfolded, and more than 10,000 loads have now been accumulated. In Jubaobao Village, Fengzhen County, Suiyuan Province, during the investigation of hidden land and the evaluation of burdens, the masses had the idea that "biting people does not benefit us." They were reluctant to report hidden land. The winter school put forward the slogan "If one family conceals land, everyone suffers," and as a result, the masses automatically squeezed out 13 hectares of hidden land, which also affected other villages, making the work of squeezing out hidden land and evaluating burdens a smooth success. Village cadres in the second district of Qiuxian County, Hebei Province, used people's schools to explain policies, dispelling the masses' concerns about "fearing to engage in sideline occupations, paying taxes, and not making money from hard work." As a result, ginning workshops and oil mills were all active. In Liang'erzhuang Village alone, there were eleven cotton gins, which ginned 4,300 catties of cotton for Yutai Company in two months, earning 5,590 catties of millet. Xin County in Pingyuan Province combined learning organizations and production organizations, and changed organizational forms with seasonal changes, not only carrying out winter schools, but also insisting on year-round people's schools.
            II. Several Decisive Conditions
    Adapting to the masses' urgent cultural needs after land reform, the winter literacy campaign became a conscious movement of the masses. The leadership's attention, the cadres' responsibility, and the leading role of Party members and Youth League members guaranteed the development of the movement.
    The vigorous development of the winter literacy campaign in North China is mainly due to the following reasons:
    (1) Adapting to the masses' learning needs, the winter literacy campaign has become a conscious movement of the masses. After the land reform in most areas of North China, the masses who have turned over are eager to learn culture, and they actively build their own winter schools. For example, the masses in Majiagou, Wu County, automatically cut down trees to make tables and benches before school started. Wang Jiangcheng in Dongguan Village, Licheng, bought a writing brush in September to prepare for winter school. Young man Wang Heqin requested that cultural lessons be held once a day, and Jin Futang of Maicang Village, who originally did not know a single character, proposed a plan to learn 500 characters this winter. Jiaobei Village in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang opened a winter school as early as October 28 last year. At that time, more than 100 students bought their own kerosene to attend classes. On the basis of the masses' conscious willingness, organizing them to learn and giving play to their enthusiasm and creativity is one of the basic conditions for carrying out winter schools.
    (2) The leadership's attention, the cadres' responsibility, and the leading role of Party members and Youth League members guaranteed the development of the winter literacy campaign. All provinces (cities) conscientiously implemented the spirit of the Ministry of Education's winter school instructions and the former North China People's Government's winter school implementation outline, and universally established unified winter school leadership organizations including the Party, government, Youth League, and Women's Federation, and transferred a considerable number of cadres to strengthen the guidance work in experimental counties or key areas. Licheng and other counties even conducted in-depth mobilization through Party congresses and joint meetings of district cadres, and village cadres and Party members and Youth League members played an active leading and promoting role. At the winter sports committee in Ershilibao, Ding County, it was proposed that the cadre class should start school first, and it was guaranteed that their family members would be mobilized to enroll first. Youth League member Gu Fazi proposed to guarantee to organize the Youth League members in the east, and Women's Congress cadre Liu Chunran guaranteed to go to school first every day, and teach the learned characters to his sister-in-law at home. All the women members proposed to spin yarn every day to produce and solve the cost of buying books. In this way, only three days after the start of school, 33 of the 36 cadres participated in the learning. Among the 82 Youth League members, 63 went to school, and among the 75 women, 53 went to school, and everyone bought textbooks for people's schools. Under their influence, winter schools developed quickly.
    A large number of winter school teachers were trained and teaching methods were studied. Political textbooks and literacy textbooks were compiled and printed in various places.
    (3) Winter school teachers were collectively trained, and teaching methods were studied. During the preparation stage of winter schools, 9,840 winter school teachers were trained in 36 counties in Hebei Province, among which, according to statistics from 16 counties including Xinle, those with a primary school education or above accounted for 97.5 percent. A total of 7,217 people were trained in four special districts in Shanxi Province. A total of 1,056 people were trained in five counties, Xin County, Jiyuan, Hui County, Shan County, and Boping in Pingyuan Province. Qinghe, Longsheng, and other counties in Suiyuan Province also collectively trained winter school teachers in a short period of time. In addition to explaining this year's winter school guidelines and tasks, the training content also included agricultural technical knowledge such as field seed selection, tree planting and protection methods, scientific common sense such as wind, rain, thunder and lightning, and common sense of maternal and child hygiene, and teaching methods were studied. The trained winter school teachers were in high spirits. In order to implement the teaching plan, Shanxi Province established "teaching stations." The county magistrate of Lucheng County, the propaganda minister of the county Party committee, the secretary, and the heads of civil affairs and education departments formed a teaching group, allocated time, and went to five districts to carry out teaching with unified content, which not only solved the difficulty of winter school teachers not being able to attend political classes, but also greatly improved their political awareness and professional ability. The issue of the treatment of winter school teachers has also been properly addressed in various places. Generally, they are exempted from duties during the teaching period, and mutual assistance and exchange of work are implemented. Poor teachers are also given material subsidies to encourage winter school teachers to work with peace of mind.
    (4) Political and literacy textbooks were compiled and printed, providing concrete materials for teaching. Before the start of school, all provinces and cities promptly compiled political teaching materials with the Common Program and Sino-Soviet friendship as the central content, and some also compiled production teaching materials and health teaching materials. The first batch of volumes 1 and 2 of the people's school literacy textbook compiled by the former North China People's Government Ministry of Education has been printed in more than 1.5 million copies (the number of issues is far from the demand of the masses). Counties have self-compiled supplementary teaching materials, such as the five departments of the Public Security Bureau, the Judicial Section, the Construction Section, the Cultural Center, and the Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Research Association in Jiaocheng County, which separately compiled popular teaching materials on public security, marriage, production, anti-superstition, and hygiene. Licheng also compiled and printed a winter school manual, which played a great role in the development of the winter literacy campaign.
            III. Three Suggestions
    In areas where winter schools have already been carried out, the effects of the winter schools should be earnestly checked in accordance with the Ministry of Education's and the former North China People's Government's winter school instructions.
    (1) In areas where winter schools have already been carried out, the teaching effects should be earnestly checked in accordance with the content and key points of winter school education indicated by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the former North China People's Government. Attention should be paid to consolidating the organization and improving teaching efficiency. The leadership should strengthen the guidance of key winter schools and create experience to guide general winter schools. Shanxi Province's establishment of "teaching stations" and Baoding Prefectural Commissioner's proposal to establish winter school central school districts, with teachers from winter schools with higher quality as the center, implementing a "wholesale" system for winter school teachers with lower levels… and other methods can be promoted. In areas with a good foundation, it is even more important to strengthen the literacy education of young men and women in a planned way, especially the education of cadres and active elements, improve teaching methods, organize learning leadership cores, and lay a good foundation for carrying out the literacy campaign next year. Strive to have a larger number of winter schools converted into regular people's schools after the end of the winter school.
    Check and help areas that have not yet opened winter schools to start winter schools.
    (2) Areas that have not yet opened winter schools should be checked, and they should be helped to overcome difficulties according to the circumstances, and strive to start schools. First of all, it is necessary to explain the important significance of this year's winter school and that the winter school is an effective method to promote central work, and correct the wrong ideas of some cadres who believe that "carrying out winter schools will hinder central work" and some winter school teachers who believe that "winter schools are held every year, and they are the same old thing anyway." Recently, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government instructed: "County and district cadres in county districts or resident base villages should become natural counselors of winter schools, and should consciously cooperate with central principals and winter school teachers to organize competitions in villages near the base villages, and hold small-scale observation meetings and forums to promote the development of winter schools," which is absolutely necessary.
    Mobilize the masses to enroll, opposing both coercion and command and laissez-faire.
    (3) In mobilizing the masses to enroll, it is necessary to oppose the method of coercion and command, and at the same time, it is also necessary to oppose the phenomenon of laissez-faire. For example, the cadres in Beidong Village, Yi County, are very active in going to school, but they cannot play a core role. For those who do not go to winter school, they do not patiently mobilize them, but simply ask: "What are you thinking if you don't come to winter school? Do you have any opinions about us?" This kind of disguised coercive method is not good. However, it is also not good for some places to not actively mobilize the masses, using the excuse that the masses are not willing and adopting a laissez-faire attitude. For example, Beiguan in Yuci only emphasized that the masses voluntarily sign up, but did not mobilize and organize them. As a result, among the 800 people who should have enrolled, only 20 people arrived at the opening ceremony. The most important thing in mobilizing the masses to enroll is to understand the masses' thinking, dispel their concerns, and stimulate their enthusiasm for learning, so as to achieve the goal of "the masses running schools and the masses going to school."

    华北区冬学开始阶段概况
    阚射军
            一、冬学开展的情况
    华北区冬学运动，一般在去年十一月后半月开始，经过一个多月的发展，其规模不仅比一九四八年的冬学运动较为普遍，而且群众的学习成绩也很显著。据冬学开始阶段的不完全统计，河北省行唐等十四个县三、四六九个行政村，开学者有二、五一二村，占总村数的百分之七十二，其中行唐县最多，占百分之九十四，深泽县最少，占百分之四十三，参加学习的一五二、四六三人，内有妇女五四、八一二人。另据蠡县等八个县统计，青年入学的有六七、七三六人。比起一九四八年冀中赵县等十三县（市）开办冬学最多的博野县，只占全县村数百分之八十，而最少的文新县只占全县村数百分之十一，冬学数目显然已有增加。
    山西省黎城等十七县二、二四○行政村，已开办冬学四、五五八处，每一行政村平均有两座多，超过原计划每一行政村平均一座半的数目，和一九四八年太行左权等二十五县（市）平均每一行政村有冬学一·二一处比较是更发展了。青年文化补习班，根据昔阳、黎城、绛县等十九县统计，参加的男女青年七四、七九二人。左权县桐滩村等十五个村的青年，有百分之九十八入了青年补习班。
    各地冬学相继开课，短时间内文化、政治教育均收到良好效果。
    平原省的部分统计，现有冬学二、七八五处，男女学员二八、五九○人。只清平县已有一四八村的冬学开学，入学人数一二、○八八人。
    察哈尔省雁北、察南两个专区，开办冬学一、六五一处，男女学员六五、四七四人。张家口市和大同市，已有民校六五处，入学的三、三六○人。
    绥远省全境解放较晚，只绥东十县布置冬学运动，据丰镇、集宁、武东、陶林、兴和五县统计已创办冬学一一六处，男女入学的达三千余名。
    北京郊区的冬学，系结合土地改革进行，在其所辖街、镇、行政村等二八六个行政单位中，已开办冬学三五一班，参加学习的一三、五五一人，一向没有机会学习的妇女现已纷纷入学，以十九区为例，参加学习的妇女已有一、三六六人，占全区学员百分之四八·五。
    冬学开学后，许多地区发动群众，进行民主编班，划组，制订功课表、个人学习计划，讨论学习公约，建立请假、测验等制度，不论政治教育与文化学习，都收到不少的成绩。如山西省方山县班庄村，在两星期内，很多青年学会四十多个生字，平均每天能识三个字；李天喜一字不识，自开学后一次未误，现已识字五十七个；黎城中庄村的学员，都学会唱国歌。河北省新乐县安太庄四十多个学员中，多的已认识三百多字，少的也识四十个生字。各地冬学，大部配合中心工作，进行了政策教育也推进了中心工作。山西交城北关在冬学里讲了积肥的好处，全街积肥运动，就很快的开展起来，现已积了一万多担。绥远省丰镇县巨宝庄在查黑地评负担中，群众中存在着“咬人与咱无好处”的思想，对隐瞒黑地，不愿报告，冬学里即提出“一家瞒地，大家吃亏”的口号，结果群众自动挤出黑地十三顷，还影响了其他村庄，使挤黑地评负担工作，顺利完成。河北省邱县二区村干部利用民校讲政策，打破群众“怕搞副业纳税，费劲赚不了钱”的顾虑，因而轧花坊、油坊都活动起来，光梁二庄就有十一架轧花车，两个月给裕太公司轧了四、三○○斤棉花，赚小米五、五九○斤。平原省莘县把学习组织和生产组织结合起来，随着季节变更组织形式，不但开展了冬学，而且可以坚持长年民校。
            二、几个决定条件
    适应了土地改革后群众迫切的文化要求，冬学运动成为群众自觉性的运动。领导重视、干部负责、党团员带头，保证了运动的开展。
    华北区冬学运动的蓬勃开展，主要的是由于下列原因：
    （一）适应了群众的学习要求，冬学成为群众的自觉运动。华北大部地区经过土地改革，群众翻身后，迫切要求学习文化，他们主动的建设自己的冬学。如武乡马家沟群众在未开学前，就自动砍树木做桌凳。黎城东关村王江城在九月就买了毛笔，准备冬学使用。青年王河芹要求文化课一天上一次，麦仓村靳富堂本来一字不识，今冬提出要求学会五百字的计划。石家庄郊区焦北村，早在去年十月二十八日即开办冬学，当时即有一百多学员自己买灯油上课。在群众自觉自愿的基础上，组织他们学习，发挥他们的积极性和创造性，这是开展冬学的基本条件之一。
    （二）领导上重视，干部负责，党团员带头，保证了冬学运动的开展。各省（市）认真的贯彻了中央人民政府教育部的冬学指示及前华北人民政府冬学实施纲要的精神，普遍建立了包括党、政、青年团、妇联等统一领导冬学的组织，抽调相当数量干部加强实验县或重点区的辅导工作。黎城等县更通过党代会、区干部联席会，作了深入的动员，各村干部及党员团员起了积极的带头与推动作用。定县二十里堡在冬运委员会上，提出干部班先开学，并保证先动员自己的家属入学，青年团员顾发子提出保证把东头团员组织起来，妇代会干部刘春冉保证每天先到校，并把学会的字回家教给他的嫂嫂，全体妇女会员提出每天纺线生产，解决买书费用，这样开学仅三天，三十六个干部中，就有三十三人参加学习。青年团八十二人中，到校者六十三人，妇女七十五人中到校五十三人，每人都买了民校课本。在他们的影响下，冬学很快的开展起来。
    大批集训了冬学教员，研究了教学方法。各地并编印了政治教材与识字课本。
    （三）集训了冬学教员，并研究教学方法。在冬学准备阶段，河北省三十六县共训练冬学教员九八四○人，其中新乐等十六县统计，小学程度以上的占百分之九七·五。山西省四个专区共训练七、二一七人。平原省莘县、济源、辉县、单县、博平五县共训练一、○五六人。绥远省清河、龙胜等县也都在短期内，集训了冬学教员。训练内容除讲解今年冬学方针任务外，有些地区还学习田间选种、树木栽培保护法等农业技术知识、风雨雷电等科学常识及妇婴卫生常识，并研究了教学方法。受训的冬学教员情绪很高。为了贯彻教学的计划，山西省建立了“传授站”、潞城县长、中共县委宣传部长、秘书、民政、教育科长等组成一个传授组，划定时间，分赴五个区，以统一内容进行传授，不但解决冬学教员上不了政治课的困难，而且对其政治认识、业务能力都有很大的提高。冬学教员的待遇问题，各地也适当注意解决，大致是任教期间免除勤务，实行互助换工，贫苦的教师，还予以物质津贴，促使冬学教员安心工作。
    （四）编印了政治与识字课本，为教学准备了具体材料。开学前，各省市大都以共同纲领、中苏友好等为中心内容及时的编成政治教材，有的还编了生产教材和卫生教材。前华北人民政府教育部编的民校识字课本一、二册，第一批已印发一百五十多万册（发行数量，与群众需求，相差甚大），各县有自编补充教材的，如交城县公安局、司法科、建设科、文化馆、中西医药研究会等五部门，分编了治安、婚姻、生产、反迷信、卫生等通俗教材，黎城还编印了冬学手册，对冬学运动的开展，起了很大作用。
            三、三点意见
    冬学已经开展起来的地区，应根据教育部及前华北人民政府冬学指示，切实检查冬学效果。
    （一）在冬学已经开展起来的地区，应根据中央人民政府教育部及前华北人民政府所指示的冬学教育内容和重点，切实检查其教学效果。要注意巩固组织与提高教学效率的工作。在领导上要加强重点冬学的辅导，创造经验指导一般冬学。山西省建立“传授站”与保定专署提出建立冬学中心学区，以质量较高的为中心冬学教师，对程度低的冬学教师，实行“趸卖制”……等方法，可以发扬。在基础较好的地区，更重要的是有计划的加强男女青年的识字教育，尤其是干部与积极分子的教育，改进教学方法，组织学习领导核心，打好明年开展识字运动的基础。争取冬学结束后，有较多数量的冬学，转为经常民校。
    检查并帮助没有开办冬学的地区，把冬学办起来。
    （二）对还没有开办冬学的地区，要进行检查，分别情况帮助其克服困难，争取开学。首先要解释今年冬学的重要意义与冬学是推动中心工作的有效方法，纠正某些干部认为“开展冬学就要妨碍中心工作”及某些冬学教员认为“年年搞冬学，反正是老一套”的错误想法。最近山西省人民政府指示：“县区或驻基点村的县区干部要成为冬学的当然辅导员，应有意识的配合中心校长、冬学教员，在基点村附近村庄组织竞赛，并举行小型的观摩与座谈会，推动冬学的开展”，这是完全必要的。
    动员群众入学，既反对强迫命令，又反对放任自流。
    （三）在动员群众入学上，要反对强迫命令的办法，同时也要反对放任自流的现象。如易县北董村的干部上学很积极，但不能起核心作用，对于不上冬学的人，不去耐心的动员，只是简单的追问：“你不来上冬学是啥思想？对我们有意见吗？”这种变相的强迫办法是不好的。但是有的地方不积极的去动员群众，借口群众不自愿而放任自流，也是不好的。如榆次北关只强调了群众自愿报名，而不加以动员组织，结果应入学的八百人中，开学典礼时，只到了二十人。动员群众入学，最重要的是了解群众思想，解除其顾虑，启发其学习的积极性，达到“群众办学，群众上学”的目的。
