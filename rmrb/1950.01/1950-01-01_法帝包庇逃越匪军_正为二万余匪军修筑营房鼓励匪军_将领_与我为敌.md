Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 31st: Kuomintang bandit troops fleeing into French-occupied areas of Vietnam have reached over 23,000, and they are being sheltered by the French. According to a United Press report from Hanoi on the 22nd, the French military commander in Tonkin, Vietnam, Lieutenant General Alexandre, admitted that over 23,000 Kuomintang bandit troops had entered Vietnam in the past ten days; the French colonial government also admitted to supplying them with military rations. The same report quoted "French sources" as saying that they will also "provide lumber to repair barracks." A United Press report from Hong Gai, Vietnam, on the 25th also described the preferential treatment now being received by the Kuomintang bandit troop "generals" near Hong Gai. The report stated that the French "gave them a well-equipped villa and provide them with canned meat every day." These bandit troop "generals," sheltered and encouraged by the French, vowed to fight the Chinese people to the end.

    正为二万余匪军修筑营房鼓励匪军“将领”与我为敌
    【新华社北京三十一日电】进入越南法国占领区的国民党匪军已达二万三千余人，他们受到法方的包庇。据合众社河内二十二日电，驻越南东京的法国军事长官亚历山大中将承认在十天当中进入越南的国民党匪军已有二万三千人；法殖民政府并承认曾以军粮供给他们。同电引用“法方人士”的话说，他们还将“供给木料，修理营房”。合众社越南鸿基二十五日电并描述现在鸿基附近的国民党匪军“将领”们所受到的优渥待遇。该电称法方“给了他们一所设备齐全的别墅，每天还配给他们罐头肉”。这些受到法方庇护和鼓励的匪军“将领”们，则发誓要与中国人民作战到底。
