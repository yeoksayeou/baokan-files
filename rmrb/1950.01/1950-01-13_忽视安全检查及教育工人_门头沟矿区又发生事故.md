    Neglecting Safety Inspections and Worker Education
    Another Accident Occurs in the Mentougou Mining Area
    [Beijing News] Due to insufficient safety equipment inspections and inadequate worker education, the Mentougou mining area experienced four consecutive tragic accidents in the first three days of the New Year: One miner was electrocuted and two injured at the public Mentougou Coal Mine; two were killed and three injured by explosions at the Junmin Kiln and Jinshengyi Kiln.
    On December 31st of last year, Lian Chunrun, a miner at the Mentougou Coal Mine, was electrocuted when he touched an electric wire while pulling a coal cart in the pit. On New Year's Day, miners Zhang Zengshou and Huang Zhenlv were drilling blasting holes when Zhang Zengshou used an iron rod to detonate the explosive, injuring both of them. On New Year's Eve, Wang Yizhi, the foreman of the Junmin Kiln, was leading workers, including Bian Tianhai, to dig a "juan" (to break through the rock layer). A small stone fell into the blasting hole. They tried to push the stone in with a steel bar, but accidentally detonated the detonator, killing Bian Tianhai instantly and seriously injuring Wang. On January 2nd, miners Zhang Liansheng, Duan Jiang, Zhang Zhenxiang, and others from the privately-owned Jinshengyi Kiln were drilling holes for blasting. After lighting two fuses, the first blast went off, but the second did not. After waiting for a while, they assumed the fuse had gone out and approached to check. At that moment, the blast went off, killing Zhang Liansheng and injuring Duan Jiang and Zhang Zhenxiang.
    To prevent worker casualties in the Mentougou mining area, safety inspections were conducted at both the public coal mine and the private kilns two months ago. The public mine has seen some positive results in correcting employees' neglect of safety, but the inspection of underground equipment has not been thorough enough, and the promulgated safety regulations have not been conscientiously implemented. Although the mine prohibits the use of iron rods for blasting and has distributed wooden rods to each group, some workers, due to insufficient education, still neglected safety measures and continued to use iron rods. Furthermore, coal masters, foremen, and supervisors in the pit were not conscientious in their supervision, leading to the accident. In the mine, many electric wires have exposed copper wires, and because of dampness and water, electric shock is easy. The Mentougou Coal Mine has now dispatched mechanical and electrical teams and mining teams to inspect the mine, replacing more than 1,000 meters of new wires in areas with many workers. On the 3rd, a meeting was held with the heads of the Party, government, labor union, and youth league, as well as engineers, and it was decided to further strengthen worker safety education, inspire workers to pay attention to safety and abide by discipline. A pit safety team consisting of members from the mining team, mechanical and electrical team, and labor union will be established to create a regular system of inspections every half month. The education of workers in small kilns is even worse. In addition to continuing to improve the engineering equipment of the small kilns, the Mining Affairs Office and the Small Kiln Labor Union have decided to further strengthen the education of workers, find ways to improve workers' blasting techniques, and study the use of appropriate fuses.

### 忽视安全检查及教育工人  门头沟矿区又发生事故

    忽视安全检查及教育工人
    门头沟矿区又发生事故
    【北京讯】门头沟矿区由于对安全设备检查的不深入和对工人教育不够，在新年三天里，又连续发生惨案四起：公营门头沟煤矿电死矿工一人，炸伤两人；小窑军民窑和金生义记窑，炸死两人，炸伤三人。
    去年十二月三十一日，门头沟煤矿矿工连春润，在井下拉煤斗时，因碰到电线，被电死。元旦，该矿矿工张增寿、黄振旅打炮眼时，张增寿用铁棍将药震响，两个人都被炸伤。除夕，小窑军民窑工头王益志带领工人边田海等在窑下打卷（即打穿石层），炮眼里落了一小块石头，他们想把石子用钢钎子打进去，不料把雷管打炸，边田海当时被炸死，王受重伤。一月二日私营金生义记小窑矿工张连生、段江、张振祥等四人打眼放炮，把两个眼点捻后，第一炮响了，第二炮没响，等了一会儿，他们以为药捻灭了，就走近去看，不料这时炮响了，炸死了张连生，炸伤了段江和张振祥。
    为避免门头沟矿区工人的伤亡，两个月前，公营煤矿和私营小窑都进行了安全检查。公矿在纠正职工忽视安全方面，已有效果，但对井下设备，还没有普遍深入的检查，对已经公布的安全条例，也没有认真贯彻下去。矿上虽然禁止使铁棍放炮，并发给各小组木棍，但因对工人教育不够，个别工人仍忽视安全办法沿用铁棍；井下煤师、总管、监工，也没认真负责监督，以致发生事故。该矿井下电线，很多地方露着铜丝，又因潮湿有水，所以容易触电。现在门矿已派机电组采煤组下井检查，在作活人多的地方，换装新线一千多米。并在三日召开党、政、工、团负责人和工程师会议，决定进一步加强工人安全教育，启发工人注意安全，遵守纪律。并由采煤组、机电组、工会合组井下安全组，树立经常制度，每半月检查一次。小窑方面，对工人教育更差，现在矿务处和小窑工会，除继续改善小窑工程设备外，并决定进一步加强对工人的教育，设法改进工人放炮技术，研究使用合适的药捻子。
