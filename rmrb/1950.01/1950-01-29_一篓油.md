    "A Cask of Oil"
    Zhang Zhimin
    Editor's Note: This article was originally published in the "North China People's Liberation Army" on November 16th of last year, and is reprinted here. Although it is a simple account of life in a company, it is very moving and of educational significance. It tells us that the new heroism is firmly built on the foundation of unity and mutual assistance. The spirit of unity and mutual assistance, unique to our People's Liberation Army, is not only manifested on the battlefield, but also runs through all aspects of daily life. The mutual assistance behavior with a high degree of class consciousness shown in this daily life demonstrates the victory of true humanitarianism and revolutionary morality.
    I arrived at the Third Company just as they were summarizing their training work for this period. After studying the spirit of this instruction, the branch committee decided to first have each squad discuss it, then convene cadres above the squad level to collectively report on the discussion, and then proceed with the summary.
    After the meeting, several company-level cadres discussed going to participate in the meetings of each squad separately. I asked Instructor Li: "Which squad should I go to?" He and Company Commander Xu looked at each other, as if they were discussing it with their eyes. He then drawled out a "You—" and lowered his head as if thinking further. Although I didn't tell him what kind of squad I was looking for, it seemed he already knew my purpose. He continued: "Go to the Fifth Squad! The Fifth Squad lives in the north room in the back courtyard. The squad leader's surname is Qin." As soon as he mentioned going to the Fifth Squad, Company Commander Xu chuckled. I didn't know what he was laughing at, so I naturally asked: "What are you laughing at, Company Commander Xu?" He couldn't hold back his laughter and said: "You'll naturally know when you get there. There are the most stories in the Fifth Squad. If you're going to interview them, don't leave out our monster – 'A Cask of Oil'."
    I didn't have time to ask what the allusion of "A Cask of Oil" was, but I had already guessed that it wasn't a story, but a person's nickname, probably a very interesting person.
    When I walked into the Fifth Squad's room, they all habitually stood up as if their leader had gone to see them. One person gave the command to stand at attention and saluted me. I hurriedly returned the salute and asked them to sit down. I casually sat on the edge of the kang ( platform bed).
    The squad leader was a quite capable young man. Although there were only twelve people at this meeting, including me, and we were sitting in a very tight circle, he still spoke as loudly as if he were giving commands on the training ground: "Today we're holding a meeting to discuss the training work of this period. Everyone should express their opinions, and any opinions should also be raised for criticism among each other." After saying this, I followed his gaze and knew he was glancing at the fattest soldier. At that time, I asked myself: "Could this be 'A Cask of Oil'?"
    Many people wanted to express their opinions. Almost half of them raised their hands. The squad leader observed for a moment and designated a soldier to speak first. Before speaking, this soldier looked at me, as if he was a bit restrained because I was participating in the meeting. He also said first: "I'm a rough fellow, and I don't know how to speak well. Please bear with me." I understood that if I hadn't been participating, he wouldn't have made this polite remark.
    According to the question just raised, he continued: "The training has been quite successful these past few days. Take the internal affairs of our squad, for example. We often receive praise from the company. When we first came back from the west, before the training, the room was a mess, like a general store, especially Yi Weny ou's stuff; it was even more chaotic than a second-hand clothing stall." As he spoke, he glanced at the fat soldier. The fat soldier also returned a glance. I realized that "A Cask of Oil"'s real name was probably Yi Weny ou.
    He continued: "There are still many shortcomings. For example, on the training ground, no one is allowed to laugh, but our squad can't stop laughing. Other squads also look over at us, as if there's something rare in our squad." Saying this, the eyes of the entire squad turned to the fat soldier.
    Before he could finish speaking, another impetuous soldier, already eager to speak, was a little restless. He hadn't been given permission by the squad leader, but he jumped in and said: "Let me say something: It's all because of our squad's 'A Cask of Oil'. Especially these last two days, wearing cotton clothes, he's really the same height standing or lying down. On the training ground, doing marching exercises, the company commander requires 114 steps per minute, each step being 75 centimeters. Think about it, even if our 'Cask of Oil' rolls, he can't keep up! He's so fat that he can't even turn his neck to dress to the right! When doing calisthenics, he's like a wooden stool; he doesn't move at all. I think if he gets any fatter, he won't even be able to wipe his own behind! Just being fat isn't enough; he's also a little deaf. The other day, the whole company assembled, and the company commander shouted 'Attention!', and he started walking. The whole company laughed until their stomachs hurt. People said: '"A Cask of Oil" is the officer of the day, going out to report the numbers!' Besides, if you're not good at it, you should train hard, but as soon as he finishes training, he sleeps like a dead pig. He'll never get any better in this life. I don't think our squad will ever be good with him around."
    The fat soldier sat blankly on the kang, not saying a word, breathing heavily, staring intently at one spot. I knew he must be very sad, because some of the above comrades' speeches weren't meant to help a comrade, but to satirize and amuse, so I kept watching his expression.
    Another soldier wanted to express his opinion. The squad leader pointed at him and said: "Vice squad leader, you speak." He was a seemingly honest and simple man in his thirties, like a seasoned and hardworking farmer. He said unhurriedly: "I'll first examine my own shortcomings, which is that my management is not strict enough. I'm responsible for the internal affairs of the squad. Although we've received several commendations, we're still far from perfect. To achieve standardization, we still need to work hard. Although there's been progress during this training period, there are also many shortcomings. Some people don't perform well. They're used to guerrilla habits, saying things like: 'Training is not as good as fighting!' 'What's the use of marching? When the enemy comes, no one walks 114 steps per minute!' 'It's better to go south than to train!' These things have affected our training work."
    He hadn't finished speaking, but he paused, as if thinking about how to say it well. He said: "I don't agree with the above opinions about Yi Weny ou. He's fat, that's how he was born. What can he do? He can't cut off two pieces of meat. You can't just look at a person's bad points. We can't forget that he performed meritorious service in the past during the fighting. During the battle of Kouqian, the company gave our platoon the task of blocking the enemy. The enemy's firepower was strong, and our platoon suffered many casualties. The platoon leader also sacrificed himself. Yi Weny ou took charge of a machine gun himself and wouldn't retreat even if it meant death. He stubbornly held back more than a hundred enemies. Now, because of this training, because he's fat and his movements aren't nimble, everyone laughs at him, treats him like a joke. This is absolutely unacceptable. Yi Weny ou used to be very good. Now they've all turned him into a fool. He looks even dumber than before. We all have to examine ourselves."
    The two comrades who had spoken earlier looked quite unconvinced, but they couldn't come up with any rebuttals, so they just lowered their heads and didn't say anything.
    Seeing that the development of this meeting was not going smoothly, the squad leader asked Yi Weny ou: "What are your opinions? Speak up!"
    Yi Weny ou raised his head and looked at everyone, then lowered his head again. When the squad leader urged him to speak, he just said, "I have no opinions." Because since the training began, people had been laughing at him for being stupid, and all kinds of harsh sarcastic remarks had passed through his ears. These unpleasant things had become a knot in his heart, and he couldn't say it all in one breath, so he simply didn't say anything.
    This meeting was very unsuccessful. No problems were solved, and everyone stopped speaking. As a result, the squad leader had no choice but to make a simple conclusion and announce the adjournment of the meeting.
    I thought that to understand this problem, I first needed to talk to the leader of their Party cell, then talk to Comrade Yi Weny ou himself, and then discuss with the cadres of their company how to resolve it. As a result, I first called out the leader of their squad's Party cell, and we sat in a corner and began to talk.
    The cell leader was the vice squad leader who had spoken last at the meeting. He said to me: "When the training first started, the company proposed striving for a model squad and winning the model banner. They set several conditions, one of which was: all squad members must score above 80 points in training ground events. Everyone in our squad had high confidence, especially the squad leader. He's the kind of person who doesn't want to fall behind in anything. He personally wrote a letter to the company, saying that he would guarantee to lead the Fifth Squad well, strive for a model squad, and definitely win the model banner. Our squad has no other difficulties, except that Yi Weny ou is too stupid. The squad leader is always annoyed by him. He doesn't give him a good look when he sees him. He calls him a 'burden' and a 'stupid bug' all day long, and he wishes he could transfer him out immediately. But there's no place to transfer him to. He'd be stupid in any squad! And you can't ask him to retire from the army. They treat him like that. Yi Weny ou has been in a bad mood since the training started. The worse he gets, the more they look down on him."
    I asked: "How did your Party members ensure this matter?"
    "We reported this problem to the higher authorities long ago, but it hasn't been resolved. There are three Party members in our squad. One of them says whatever people tell him to say. We criticized him at the cell meeting yesterday, and he's a little better now."
    I asked: "How do you think this problem should be solved?"
    "I think the first thing is to get through to the thinking of people like our squad leader. You can't satirize people just because they're stupid, and you can't patiently help them to improve. People are born fat. The deafness in his ears was caused by shelling. Is there any shame in that? Forcing a camel to bend over doesn't conform to human nature. If everyone is good to him, he will improve."
    After talking to him to this point, I told him to go back and called Yi Weny ou out.
    Yi Weny ou walked up to me and first stood at attention and saluted. When I asked him to sit down, he refused to sit. So I accompanied him and stood and talked. He looked even fatter standing here than when I saw him at the meeting, because he was half a head shorter than me, who is a small person. So I began to talk to him about everyday things:
    "How old are you?"
    "Twenty-three."
    "How many years have you been in the army?"
    "Three years."
    "Are you a Party member?"
    "Not yet."
    "What did you do at home?"
    "Weaving mats."
    "What are your opinions now?"
    "I want to fight. I just frown when training."
    "Why is that?"
    "The people here all laugh at me, saying I'm stupid. When they're happy, they make fun of me. When they're not happy, they glare at me. My name is Yi Weny ou, but they all call me 'A Cask of Oil'. How can I work like this?"
    I asked: "Do you think you've made any progress since the training started?"
    "There is progress, but people can't see it. I've only fought since I joined the army. I haven't trained properly. I couldn't even maintain a proper posture before. Now I can recite it by heart. But because I'm fat... I can't help it? Besides, they don't patiently teach me. They just satirize me."
    "Who is satirizing you?"
    "The first one to express his opinion at the meeting was Wang Limin. He's educated and eloquent. He says things like, 'Rotten wood cannot be carved,' and I don't understand it. He also calls me 'Atomic Bomb,' 'Blockhead,' and 'Night Pot Sack Hat.' Our squad leader isn't good to me either. I'm a pain in his eyes. He says: 'With "A Cask of Oil" in our Fifth Squad, the Fifth Squad will have to carry a turtle.'"
    Finally, I explained to him: "It's wrong for them to treat you like this. I'm going to discuss a solution with your company leaders. You can't be pessimistic. Progress is good. The five fingers can't be the same length. If you progress slowly, you can work harder and catch up with them."
    He happily saluted me and went back.
    The next day, a meeting of cadres above the squad level was held in the company headquarters to conduct a collective report. The small room was packed. More than twenty squad leaders and platoon leaders attended. Everyone felt it was quite casual.
    The company commander stood next to the table where the clerk was taking notes, waved his hand, told everyone to be quiet, and announced the start of the meeting. He designated that they would begin with the first to the twelfth squad in order.
    When it was the Fifth Squad leader's turn to speak, everyone quieted down, and their eyes turned to him, as if everyone was excitedly preparing to hear him talk about "A Cask of Oil." Sure enough, after briefly describing the general situation, he made "A Cask of Oil" the main topic and began to speak endlessly:
    "I propose that our squad's 'A Cask of Oil' be transferred away. He's not only a burden to our squad, but he's also embarrassing our Third Company. Fortunately, on October 1st, the company commander left him in the kitchen to help the cooks make food. If that old man went to Tiananmen Square for the military parade, even the Soviet friends who came to visit would have laughed their teeth out. That monster, no matter which side you look at him from, he doesn't look like a soldier. If he wants to look like a soldier, unless he's called his father..." He didn't say the next few words and laughed, but others understood what he was going to say next.
    At this time, I looked around at everyone. Some people who liked to joke were laughing, but many people not only didn't laugh, but their faces were very heavy, meaning that they were dissatisfied with his attitude of satirizing and scolding comrades without adopting an attitude of reform and education.
    At that time, I saw someone hand a note to the instructor, asking to immediately refute the Fifth Squad leader's opinion. But because the next few squads hadn't reported yet, they could only have their opinions expressed later.
    When the time came, this matter naturally became the main topic. A comrade stood up to speak. I asked, and he was the ninth squad leader and a member of the branch committee. He said very bluntly: "I am most dissatisfied with the Fifth Squad leader's opinion. Yi Weny ou is a very good comrade, honest and loyal. He is one of the best in our company. He is a meritorious soldier. The regimental commander personally gave him flowers. Now, because he's a little stupid during training, they look down on him. We ourselves aren't much better than him. We're all 'half-baked'. I don't see anything to be proud of. No one is good at everything. Instead of putting in the effort to help him, they just satirize him, calling him 'A Cask of Oil'. That's insulting. In my opinion, whoever satirizes him has to examine themselves. Yi Weny ou is progressing slowly. This is a problem of leadership. And you still want to transfer him away. Where are you going to transfer him to? Expel him from the military? He hasn't made any mistakes. If the Fifth Squad doesn't want him, transfer him to our Ninth Squad! We want him."
    This tit-for-tat criticism made the Fifth Squad leader a little embarrassed. Looking at his face, it turned red and white in waves.
    Someone else continued: "There are also many shortcomings in the leadership of our company. The company commander is sometimes not serious about this matter, and everyone follows suit. If the company had corrected it earlier, it wouldn't have come to this. In addition, the condition for the model squad says above 80 points. This division must also be based on the person. You can't compare a stupid person to a clever one. Besides, reforming a slightly stupid soldier shouldn't be considered meritorious!"
    The Fifth Squad leader couldn't find anything else to say, but this competitive person didn't want to lose face in front of everyone, so he reluctantly said: "Then let the squad that has the ability to reform him have him. Anyway, our squad doesn't want him."
    Hearing him speak a little angrily, the Ninth Squad leader retorted: "Our squad wants him, but you have to examine your ideological problems. This is 'championship-ism'. You don't want Yi Weny ou in order to compete for the model banner. In my opinion, you can't compete for the model just based on this one point."
    Seeing that there was a great dispute over this issue, the company commander told everyone to stop expressing their opinions on this aspect, and adjourned the meeting for a while to convene the branch committee to study how to resolve this issue.
    The branch committee members gathered together and talked briefly. The final opinion was: Yi Weny ou will not be transferred. They cannot accommodate the Fifth Squad leader's ideological problems. They should solve the Fifth Squad leader's ideological problems and the incorrect views of some people. As long as they can help Yi Weny ou well in the future, he will naturally improve.
    Company Commander Xu announced the opinion of the branch committee to everyone, and first examined his own lack of seriousness in this matter, and requested that this trend be changed starting with the cadres and within the Party.
    After the meeting, although the Fifth Squad leader was not completely convinced in his heart, he was given a lot of education and began to realize that some of his aspects were wrong.
    That night, the instructor asked the Fifth Squad leader to come and talk, and I listened to see if there was a change in his understanding.
    The instructor asked: "Are you dissatisfied with today's meeting?"
    Although he still had a pouty and unhappy expression, he was much calmer than he was at the meeting. He said: "There are things I'm not satisfied with."
    "What things?"
    "The Ninth Squad leader said I was a champion-ist. I am, but you can't say that's wrong! Why does the higher authority require us to compete for prize banners and championships? Now they're criticizing me."
    "Do you accept the other things?"
    "What he said about the other things is right. I didn't help Yi Weny ou enough. I satirized and scolded him. I accept all of that."
    The instructor patiently explained to him: "The higher authorities ask us to compete for prize banners and championships. That's not the same as championship-ism. Championship-ism is for individual heroism, regardless of others. We are advocating new heroism. We must help others for the sake of everyone. The conditions for striving for a model squad are clearly written. The first one is 'mutual assistance'. You say you don't reform Yi Weny ou. Who is going to reform him? The more difficult the thing, the more a hero has to do it. Besides, our goal in striving for a model squad is to improve the entire training movement. Everyone has to be good. If we only train one soldier well out of the one hundred and seventy people in our company, what's the use of you being skilled all over? Everyone has to be well-trained to have strength. Are you right?"
    After hearing the instructor's words, the Fifth Squad leader felt that there was nothing wrong and realized that his main ideological problem was championship-ism, so he sincerely agreed: "Right!"
    At this time, I interjected and asked: "Is Yi Weny ou still going to be transferred?"
    "No, I'll help him."
    The instructor said: "You helping him is not just a matter of words. You must mobilize the entire squad, develop specific methods, divide the work, and everyone must not look down on him. You must patiently help him."
    "Right! We'll do it that way."
    In the evening, the instructor and I went together to attend the Fifth Squad's squad meeting. At the meeting, the first thing was the Fifth Squad leader's self-criticism. He said to everyone very sincerely and with a bit of shame: "I used to have problems in my leadership, especially the satire of Comrade Yi Weny ou, which was very wrong. Here, I apologize to him with everyone. Comrade Yi Weny ou used to be a meritorious soldier. We all respect him very much. In the future, we will respect him and help him progress as before."
    Then, many comrades also made self-criticisms.
    Yi Weny ou's face wasn't as dull as it used to be. The joy in his heart could be seen on his face. He happily said: "Our comrades are all willing to progress. As long as everyone helps me, and I work hard myself, I can progress even if I'm stupid."
    Finally, the leader of the Party cell spoke. He said: "Only in this way can our Fifth Squad strive for a model. We can't forget those eight words in the conditions for striving for a model squad: 'Unity and mutual assistance, common progress'."
    Early the next morning, before the reveille sounded, the Fifth Squad leader came out to relieve himself. He only saw a dark figure swaying left and right in the courtyard. Taking a closer look, it was Yi Weny ou practicing yesterday's training events by himself.
                                            November 10th, Beijing

    “一篓油”
    张志民
    编者按：这篇记事原登在去年十一月十六日《华北解放军》上，特转载于此。这虽是一篇简单的连队记事，却写得很动人，并且富有教育的意义。它告诉了我们，新的英雄主义是坚固的建立在团结互助的基础上。我们人民解放军所特有的团结互助精神，不只表现在战场上，而且贯串到全部日常生活中。从这种日常生活中所表现的具有高度阶级觉悟的互助行为，显示了真正的人道主义与革命道德的胜利。
    到三连正赶上总结这一个时期的练兵工作，支委会上根据这个指示的精神研究后，决定首先叫各班讨论，然后再召集班以上干部把讨论的情形集体汇报，再进行总结。
    会后，几个连级干部商量分头去参加各班开会时，我问李指导员：“我去那个班好呀？”他跟徐连长互相观望了一下，似乎是他们在从眼睛里互相商量了一番，就拉着长声的说了声“你——”又把头低下像是更反复的想着，虽然我没有告诉他我要找个什么样子的班，但看来他好像已经知道我来的目的，他接着说：“你去五班吧！五班就住在这后院北屋，班长姓秦。”一提去五班，徐连长就“扑吃”的笑了，我不知他笑的什么意思，便很自然的问道：“怎么？徐连长笑什么？”他还是板不住笑的说：“你去了自然知道，五班里故事眼最多，你要是采访的话，千万别落下我们那块怪物——一篓油。”
    我没有来得及问“一篓油”是有什么典故，可是我已经猜想到这不是个故事，一定是个人的外号，可能是个很有趣的人。
    走进五班的房子时，他们都习惯的像他们首长去看他们一样的站起来了，由一个人发了个立正的口令，就向我打了个敬礼，我急忙的还了礼后就请他们坐下来，我自己也就随便的坐在了炕沿上。
    班长是个挺精悍的小伙子，虽然这个会连我才十二个人，而且还是围了一个很紧的圈子，本来小声说话就可以听到，但是他还是像在操场上下口令似的大声说：“今天咱们开会讨论这个时期的练兵工作，大家发表意见，互相间有什么意见也要提出来批评。”说完这句话，我顺着他的眼睛看过去，知道他斜楞了那个最胖的战士一眼，当时我心里在问：“这个可能就是‘一篓油’”？
    要发表意见的人很多，差不多有一半人举起手来了，班长观察了一下，指定了一个战士先说，这个战士未曾说话以前先看了看我，样子是因为我参加这个会，说话有点拘束似的，他并且先说道：“我是个老粗，可不会说话，好坏大家包涵着点。”我明白如果没有我参加，他是不会来这个客套的。
    按照才说的问题，他继续说下去：“练兵这几天挺有成绩，就拿咱们班的内务来说吧，就常得到连里的表扬。刚打西边回来，还没练兵的时候，屋子里是乱七八糟，跟杂货铺一样，特别是易文有那一摊摊子，比那估衣摊还乱，”说着，他就瞟了那个胖战士一眼，胖子也还了他一眼，我当时已经想到，“一篓油”的真名字大概就叫易文有。
    他还接着说：“缺点还是多的很，比方在操场上作课目吧！那谁也不准笑，可是咱们班就笑的不住声，别的班里也往咱们这边瞧，像是咱们班里有什么稀罕一样，”说到这儿，全班的眼睛，都不约而同的向那个胖子转去了。
    没等他说完，另外一个挺冒失的战士，早就蹩着想说，急的他有点坐不稳的样子，他并没有得到班长允许，抢过去就说：“我说说吧：不为别的，就为咱班那个‘一篓油’，特别这两天穿上棉衣裳，那真是站着躺着一般高啦，操场上作齐步走，连长要求一分钟走一百一十四步，每一步要七十五公分，你们想想，咱们这一篓油他滚也跟不上呀！胖的他向右看齐都转不过脖子来，作柔软体操来个体向前后弯，他就像个木头蹲子，一动也不动，我看再胖下去拉屎都没法擦屁股啦！光胖还不算，又加上耳朵还有点背，那天全连集合，连长喊了个立正，他就开步走了，全连人都笑的肚子疼，人家说：‘一篓油’是值星官，出去报告人数啦！”再说，不好你倒是用心练呀，他一收操回来就睡个蛋朝天，再辈子也练不好，我看咱们班有他就好不了。”
    那个胖战士呆呆的坐在炕上，一声也不哼，出气粗粗的，两眼死盯着一个地方，我知道他心里一定很难过，因为以上同志的发言，有些不是为了帮助同志，而是讽刺取乐，所以我一会会的看着他的神色。
    又一个战士要发表意见了，班长指着他说：“副班长，你说吧，”他是个看来就很诚朴三十来岁的人，像是个饱经风霜吃苦的庄稼汉，他不紧不慢地说：“我先检讨自己的缺点，就是管理上还不够严，班里内务是我负责任，虽说受到了几次表扬，可是还差的很远，要达到正规化还得好好的努力，练兵这时期虽说有成绩，可是也有不少缺点，有的人表现不好，游击习气惯了，说什么：‘练兵不如打仗！’‘摔大腿有啥用？敌人来了谁也不一分钟走一百一十四步！’‘要练兵还不如南下哩！’这些都影响了咱们的练兵工作。”
    他的话并没有说完哩，但他停顿了一下，像是在想想怎么说好，他说：“以上对易文有的意见我不同意，人家胖，那是天生的，他自己有什么法子呢？又不能割下两块肉来，看一个人也不能光看人家不好的地方，咱们不能忘了以前打仗的时候人家立过功，打口前的时候，连里给咱们排阻击敌人的任务，敌人火力硬，咱们排伤亡不少，排长也牺牲了，人家易文有自己掌握一挺机枪，死也不退，生把一百多敌人顶住啦，这会一闹练兵，因为人家胖，动作不灵巧，谁都笑话人家，拿人家当开心小菜，这万也要不得，易文有以前挺好，这会把人家都说成傻子了，看着比以前还笨，这不能不检讨我们大家。”
    刚才发言的两个同志，看样子心里挺不服气，可是也说不出什么辩驳的理由，就只有低着脑袋不吭声了。
    班长一看这个会的发展不顺风，就问易文有：“你有什么意见，提吧！”
    易文有抬头看了大伙一下，又把头低下了，班长催他说的时候，他只是说了个“什么意见也没有。”因为他从练兵以来，人们都笑话他笨，什么难听的讽刺话都从他耳朵里过过，这些不痛快的事在他心里搅成了疙疸，一口气说不出来，所以他也就索性不说了。
    这个会开的很不成功，什么问题也没得到解决，大家就谁也不发言了，结果班长不得不作个简单的结论，宣布散会。
    我想到，我了解这个问题，首先要找到他们党的小组长谈一下，再跟易文有同志本人谈谈，以后再跟他们连的干部研究如何解决，结果就先把他们班党的小组长叫出来，我们坐在一个墙角下，开始谈起来。
    小组长就是在会上最后发言的那个副班长，他向我说：“开始一练兵的时候，连里提出争取模范班，夺模范旗，订了几个条件，有一条是：操场课目全班都在八十分以上，我们班里大家信心都挺高，特别是班长，他是个样样都不肯落后的人，他亲自向连里写过信，说保证把五班领导好，争取模范班，一定夺过模范旗子来，我们班别的什么困难也没有，就是易文有太笨，班长心里总腻歪他，见了他就没好眼色，一天说人家‘累赘’‘笨虫’，恨不得一时把他调出去，可是又没地方调，到那班也是笨呀！又不能叫人家退伍，他们对人家这样，易文有从练兵以来情绪就不好，越不好越坏，他们就越看不上眼。”
    我问：“你们党员怎么保证的这个事呢？”
    “我们把这个问题早就反映给上级啦，总没得到解决，我们班里有三个党员，一个是人家说啥他说啥，昨天星期六开小组会批评了他，他才好点。”
    我问：“你觉着这个问题怎么解决呢？”
    “我觉着首先得打通我们班长这样人的思想，不能因为人家笨就讽刺人家，不耐心帮助人家进步，人家胖是父母生的，耳朵背是炮弹震的，这有什么耻辱的？硬逼着骆锅子弯腰都不合乎人情，大家要对人家好了，他也就进步啦。”
    和他谈到这里，我叫他回去，并叫易文有出来。
    易文有走到我面前，先立正敬了一个礼，我请他坐下时，他说什么也不肯坐，我也就陪着他站着谈起来，他站在这里比我刚才开会时看他还要胖，因为他比我这个小个儿还矮半脑袋，我便开始向他谈起了家常话：
    “你多大年纪啦？”
    “二十三。”
    “入伍几年啦？”
    “三年。”
    “入党了没有？”
    “还没有。”
    “在家干什么？”
    “编席。”
    “你现在有什么意见？”
    “我愿意打仗，我就是蹙头练兵。”
    “那为什么呢？”
    “我们这里的人尽笑话我，说我笨，高兴了拿我开心，不高兴了斜我几眼，我的名字叫易文有，他们都管我叫‘一篓油’，你想这我怎么干呀？”
    我问：“你觉着从练兵以来有点进步没有？”
    “进步是有，人家眼里看不见，我参军以来就光打仗啦，没有好好的练过兵，以前我连个立正姿势都讲不下来，这会我能背的熟烂，可就是因为我胖……我也没法呀？再说他们也不耐心教给我，光讽刺我。”
    “都是谁讽刺你？”
    “刚才开会先发表意见的那个叫王利民，他念过书，能说会道，他一天说我什么：‘朽木之材不可什么也，’我也不懂，还管我叫‘原子弹’‘草包’‘夜壶袋草帽’，我们班长对我也不好，我在他眼里是块病，他说：‘有‘一篓油’在咱们五班，五班就非得背王八。’”
    最后我向他解释说：“他们这样对你是不对的，我要跟你们连首长商量解决，你不能悲观，有进步就行，五个指头不能一般长，你进步的慢，你可以多加油，也会赶上他们。”
    他高兴的向我敬了个礼，回去了。
    第二天是在连部房子里开班以上干部会，进行集体汇报，小小的一个房间被挤得满满的，到会的班长、排长有二十多个人。大家都觉着怪随便的。
    连长站在文书作纪录的桌子旁边，挥着一只手，叫大家静一静，就宣布开会了，并且指定按一至十二班的次序开始谈。
    轮到五班长说话的时候，大家静了起来，眼睛也都向他看去，似乎任何人心里都兴奋的准备着听他说“一篓油”。果然，他把一般的情形简略的说了一下后，就把“一篓油”提为正题开始滔滔不绝的说起来：
    “我提议把我们班的‘一篓油’调走，这不光是我们班里的累赘，有他给咱们三连也丢人，幸亏十月一日那天连长把他留在伙房里帮着炊事员作饭啦，要是他老先生到了天安门阅兵场，那连苏联参观的朋友也得笑掉了大牙，这个怪物，你站在那面看他也不像个兵，他那付熊像，要像个兵除非是叫他爹……”他没有说出下面几个字就笑了，可是别人也都明白了他往下要说的话。
    在这个时候，我向所有的人看了一周，有些爱逗玩的人是笑了，但有不少人不但没有笑，而且脸色是很沉重的，意思是对他这种讽刺漫骂同志而不抱改造教育的态度表示不满。
    当时，我看到就有人给指导员递来条子，要马上驳斥五班长的意见，可是因为下面几个班还没有汇报，所以只有叫他们的意见等一下再发表。
    等到了的时间，这件事也就很自然的形成主要的题目了，一个同志站起来要说话，我问了一下，他是九班长又是支部委员，他极直爽的说：“我最不满意的就是五班长的意见，易文有是个很好的同志，老实、忠厚，在咱们连里也得数人家，他是功臣，团长亲自给人家戴过花，这会练兵因为他笨一点就看不起人家，我们自己比人家也强不了多少，都是‘半吊子’，我看没有什么骄傲的，谁也不是样样通，不下功夫帮助人家，光知道讽刺，叫人家‘一篓油’那是骂人哩，叫我看谁讽刺人家谁就得检讨自己，易文有进步的慢，这是领导上的毛病，还要把人家调走，调到那儿去呀？开除军籍吧，人家又没犯错误，五班不要就调到我们九班来吧！我们要。”
    这个针锋相对的批评，在五班长说来真是有点挂不住，我向他脸上一看，一阵阵红起白落。
    又有人接着说：“咱们连里的领导上也有很多缺点，连长有时对这事不严肃，大伙就随风儿闹起来了，连里要早一点纠正也闹不到这个地步。另外还有那个模范班的条件上说的八十分以上，这样划分也得按人说，笨的不能跟巧的一样比，再说改造了笨一点的战士也不能不算是功劳呀！”
    五班长找不到再说的话，可是这好胜的人又不愿意在大伙面前丢面子，就勉强的说：“那班有本事改造就给那班吧，反正我们班里不要。”
    九班长一听他有点生气的说话，便又顶上去说：“我们班里就要他，可是你的思想毛病也得检讨，你这就是‘锦标主义’，为争模范旗不要易文有，叫我看就凭这一条你也争不了模范。”
    连长一看这个问题有很大争执，就叫大家停止发表这一方面的意见，并且休会了一会，召集支部委员来研究这个问题究竟如何解决。
    支部委员们集拢在一起，简单的谈了一下，最后的意见是：易文有不调动，不能迁就五班长的思想毛病，应该解决五班长的思想问题和一部分人不正确的观念，只要以后能好好的帮助易文有，他自然就进步了。
    由徐连长向大家宣布了支委会的意见，并且首先检讨了自己对这个事不严肃的地方，并且要求从干部和党内作起，来转变这个风气。
    散会后，五班长虽说并没有完全从心里服气，可是总算给了他不少的教育，已经开始认识到自己有些地方不对了。
    当天晚上，指导员请五班长来谈话，我在一边听他到底认识上是不是有转变。
    指导员问：“你对今天开会不满意吗？”
    他虽然还是蹶着嘴不高兴的样子，但比开会的时候可平静多了，他说：“我有地方不满意。”
    “什么地方？”
    “九班长说我锦标主义，我就是有，可是不能说这不对呀！上级要求争奖旗，争锦标这是为什么呢？弄到这会还批评我。”
    “别的地方你都接受吗？”
    “别的地方他说的都对，我帮助易文有不够，讽刺漫骂，我都接受。”
    指导员向他耐心的解说：“咱们上级要求我们争奖旗争锦标，这跟锦标主义不一样，锦标主义是为了要个人英雄，不管别人，咱们是提倡新英雄主义，必须得为了大伙帮助别人，争取模范班的条件上写的明白，头一条就是‘互助’。你说你不改造易文有，这叫谁去改造呢？越困难的事，英雄越得作，再说咱们争取模范班是为了把整个练兵运动搞好，人人都好才行，咱们连一百七十多个人要是只练好一个兵，你就练的混身都是本事有啥用？必须得大伙都练好才是力量，你说对不对？”
    五班长听了指导员的话，觉着没有地方不对，这才知道自己主要的思想毛病是锦标主义，就很诚服的答应了一声：“对！”
    我这时插言问了一句：“易文有还要调吗？”
    “不用了，我帮助他。”
    指导员说：“你们帮助他，不是一句话的事，必须把全班动员起来，作出具体办法，分了工，大家再不能小看人家，耐心帮助才行。”
    “对！我们就这样作。”
    晚上，我跟指导员一同去参加五班的班务会，在会上首先是五班长的检讨，他很诚恳而又显得有点惭愧的和大家说：“以前我在领导上有毛病，特别是对于易文有同志的讽刺，是很不对的，我这里同着大家向他道歉赔礼，易文有同志以前是功臣，我们大家都很尊重他，今后我们还要跟早先一样的尊重他，帮助他进步。”
    接着许多同志也都进行了自我检讨。
    易文有这会的脸色不像以前那么呆板了，他心里的愉快，从脸上是可以看得出来的，就高兴的说：“咱同志们都是愿意进步的，只要大家帮助我，我自己也很好的努力，我笨也能进步。”
    最后是党的小组长发言，他说：“只有这样我们五班才能争取模范，我们不能忘记争取模范班的条件上那八个字：‘团结互助，共同进步’。”
    第二天清早，还没有吹起床号，五班长出来解手，只看到一个黑影子在院子里左左右右的摇荡，走近一瞧，易文有一个人在那里练习着昨天的课目。
                                            十一月十日于北京
