[本报讯] Beijing People's Printing Factory, Electric Power Company, Machine Factory, and 70th Ordnance Factory have successively organized technical study classes for young workers, setting off a wave of technical learning. Most of the young workers in these factories are apprentices or trainees with poor technical skills. During the Kuomintang rule, they were largely unable to engage in technical studies. Many young workers completed their apprenticeships without mastering the skills. After liberation, the People's Government called for the development of production, and learning and improving technical skills became the urgent demands of young workers. In November of last year, the Youth Workers Department first jointly held a technical seminar with the Youth League of the Electric Power Company's laboratory to study the content, methods, and time of learning, and formed a technical study class. Technical study classes for young workers in the People's Printing Factory, Machine Factory, and 70th Ordnance Factory were also successively formed. In terms of learning content, it generally focuses on practical work experience, supplemented by simple theories. The subjects of the Electric Power Company are: 1. Practical work: First explain the general situation of various meters (current, voltmeter), commonly used symbols on the meter, and gradually explain the structure, test methods, and specifications of various meters, and combine it with the experience of business trips. This lesson is most popular among young workers; sometimes they learn it in the morning and use it when they go on business trips in the afternoon. 2. Basic mathematics: including arithmetic, algebra, and trigonometry. 3. Basic physics: including magnetism, electrostatics, and electrodynamics, the purpose is to enable everyone to understand some principles and inspire creativity and invention. Due to the different nature of the work in each factory, the learning subjects are different. There are also different learning methods in each factory. One is to attend large classes, such as the Mechanical First Branch; one is to use the workplace as a classroom outside of production time for hands-on teaching; and the other is to learn while producing. For example, in the People's Printing Factory, when a machine malfunctions, the veteran technicians first explain to the young workers where the problem is, and then tell them how to repair it and the reason for repairing it in this way. This is currently considered a better method. Because young workers mainly learn technology from veteran technicians, they put great efforts into strengthening the relationship between teachers and students. On the one hand, they educate young workers to respect veteran technicians and study hard, and at the same time, they conduct class education for veteran technicians, and explain the benefits of teaching apprentices well for production and construction, and encourage them to make their skills public. The People's Printing Factory and the Machine Factory have also established material reward methods. Liu Yuechuan, a veteran technician at the People's Printing Factory, is now very active in imparting technology and constantly studies and improves his own technology. Therefore, the technical study class of the factory is well-run. Due to the hard work of the young workers, the scrap rate of the gravure printing department of the factory has been reduced from 5% in the past to 1.7% now. Most of the young workers in the Electric Power Company were not clear about electrical instruments, but now they all know its internal structure, the purpose of each part, and the experimental method. Worker Shao Ningjun experimented with connecting a KW meter, a standard W meter, an ammeter, a voltmeter, and a dummy load into a circuit during his studies, and he succeeded in wiring. He said happily: "If the Communist Party hadn't come, who would let us learn technology? And let us do experiments!" After learning, the young workers of the 70th Ordnance Factory not only understood the general principles of the machines, but also improved their work efficiency compared to the past. In the process of transforming from military industry to peaceful industry, the Machine Factory has overcome many difficulties in the transformation process due to technical learning.

    京人民印制厂等四厂青工举办技术研究班
    工人技术提高废品已见减少
    密切师徒关系  进行现场教学
    【本报讯】北京人民印制厂、电业公司、机器厂、七十兵工厂等厂纷纷组织青年工人技术研究班，掀起学习技术热潮。按各厂青工多为学徒或养成工，技术很差，在国民党统治时期，多不能进行技术学习，许多青工学徒期满，技术还没学会。解放后，人民政府号召发展生产，学习技术与提高技术便成了青工们的迫切要求。去年十一月间，青工部首先与电业公司青年团联合召开该厂试验室的技术座谈会，研究学习内容、方式及时间等问题，组成了技术学习班。人民印制厂、机器厂、七十兵工厂等厂的青工技术学习班也先后组成。学习内容上，一般是以实际工作经验为主，配合浅近的理论。电业公司的科目是：一、实际工作：先讲各种表计（电流、电压表）的概况，表上常用的符号，渐次讲到各种表的构造，试验方法和规格等，并结合讲解出差的经验。这一课最受青工的欢迎，有时上午学了，下午出差时就用得着。二、基本数学：有算术、代数和三角。三、基本物理：有磁学静电和电动学，目的在使大家懂得一些原理，启发创造和发明。由于各厂工作性质不同，学习科目各有所异。在学习方法上各厂也有不同。一种是上大课，如机械一分厂；一种是在生产时间外以工作场所为教室，进行实物教学；另一种是一面生产一面学习。如人民印制厂当机器发生毛病时，老技工们先向青工说明毛病在那里，再告诉怎样修理，和为什么这样修理的道理。这是目前被认为较好的方法。因为青工主要是向老技工学习技术，所以他们用大力来密切师徒关系。一方面教育青工尊敬老技工，好好学习技术，同时也向老技工进行阶级教育，并说明教好学徒对生产建设的好处，鼓励他们公开自己的技术。人民印制厂和机器厂并订有物质奖励办法。人民印制厂老技工刘月川现在传授技术非常积极，还随时研究改进自己的技术。故该厂技术学习班办得较好。由于青工努力学习，该厂凹印科废品率已由过去的百分之五减低到现在的百分之一·七。电业公司青工中的大部分对电气仪器不清楚，现在已都知道了它的内部构造，各部的用途及实验方法。工友邵宁俊在学习中试验将ＫＷ表，标准Ｗ表、电流表、电压表、虚负荷等连成了一个通电，接线成功了，他高兴的说：“要不是共产党来了，谁能叫咱学技术？还叫咱们做试验！”七十兵工厂青工们经过学习，除懂得了机器的一般原理外，工作效率已较前提高。机器厂在由军火工业转为和平工业中，由于技术学习，克服了在转业过程中的不少困难。
