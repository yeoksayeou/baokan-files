    Understanding Children is an Important Condition for Being a Good Teacher
    Zhong Chun
    A good teacher, in addition to possessing revolutionary educational viewpoints and enthusiasm and confidence in their work, must also understand the children who are the objects of their work, in order to "teach according to aptitude."
    Understanding children is not a simple matter. For example, children's bodies, thoughts, personalities, emotions, hobbies, will, qualities, and even boys, girls, large, small, general, and special children should all be included. Studying these things naturally easily reminds people of courses such as "child psychology." But it is disappointing to say that it is difficult to find a readable book of this kind in the old normal school textbooks. Most of those books were bought or translated from European and American bourgeois scholars. Not only are the viewpoints problematic, but the materials are also fragmented. It would be better not to read them; opening them up only makes people more confused and it is difficult to have any help for practical work.
    Here, there is no intention to specialize in psychology, and this work remains to be completed by us from future work practice and understanding. Here we will only talk about some things about children encountered in daily work. Old psychologists also admitted that psychology is based on physiology, so let's start with this aspect:
            I. Children's Physiological Conditions
    The school-age children we refer to usually refer to children in the stage from seven to twelve years old. Before this it is called pre-school age children, thirteen to sixteen years old is called adolescence, or pre-youth period. Lower grades in elementary school (first and second grade) generally refer to children of seven or eight years old according to school age, middle grades (third and fourth grade) refer to children of nine or ten years old, and upper grades (fifth and sixth grade) refer to children of eleven or twelve years old. Single-grade elementary schools are basically lower and middle grades, and should include children from seven to ten years old, but the actual situation is often not the case. It is true that there are children of eleven or twelve years old, but students of thirteen or fourteen years old are also inevitable. Therefore, what is discussed here also includes children of eleven or twelve years old. Before the age of eleven or twelve, there is no significant difference in physiological conditions between boys and girls.
    The period from three to six or seven years old is called the early childhood period, and physiological development is extremely rapid. From seven or eight years old to eleven or twelve years old, it is called the late childhood period, and the development in this period is slower than in the previous period. The situation of its physiological development is manifested in: the development of the brain has gradually approached a mature state. Children of seven or eight years old have begun to be able to use their brains and have simple understanding, thinking, imagination, and memory of things familiar to them in daily life. By the time they are eleven or twelve years old, the brain has reached a mature state. At this time, the intellectual age of smart children often exceeds their physiological age, and they can compete with young people and adults. The following situation can be seen in the ratio of head to body length: children's heads are relatively large, especially during infancy, and this is always the case until the age of six or seven. But after the age of seven or eight, this development gradually slows down.
    The development in other aspects is very incomplete. Children's bones only begin to grow more completely in number between the ages of seven and eight (such as wrist bones). Throughout childhood, the bones have less gray matter and more collagen, making the bones small, soft and weak. If you encounter poor living or working environments at this time, it is easy to deform the bones. Deciduous teeth also only begin to be replaced at the age of seven or eight. Children's muscles are very underdeveloped, their bodies are thin, so they are light in weight, have little strength, and are prone to fatigue. The breathing volume is not large, the various internal organs are not sound, and the resistance is also weak. During this period, the two aspects of children's physiological development that are the most incomplete are bones and muscles. To cultivate a healthy physique, attention must be paid to these aspects.
    To make bones grow, muscles develop, strengthen physical strength, and increase weight, the first condition that should be paid attention to is the need for good nutrition, otherwise, it will cause serious harm to the development of the body.
    Secondly, children should have sufficient outdoor exercise. Exercise in fresh air and warm sunlight can accelerate metabolism, promote blood circulation and the development of bones and muscles, expand lung breathing volume, accelerate gastrointestinal digestive function, and enable children to develop a healthy physique.
    Thirdly, children should have sufficient sleep and rest. This is an important way to regulate children's physical and mental fatigue, restore physical strength and spirit, and in sleep and rest, the activity of various functions can be reduced, so that various parts of the body can fully perform their digestive and respiratory functions and help the body grow.
    Fourthly, life should be regular. The rise and fall, diet, work and rest, the complexity, difficulty, ease of work, mental work and physical labor, etc. all need to be properly arranged to create a normal and pleasant living environment that is neither stressful nor tiring.
    A healthy body is the foundation of learning. A strong and lively child will be good in all aspects as long as the teacher is good at teaching. A good teacher who cares about children should first care about their health.
    That is to say, in daily teaching activities, attention should be paid to the complexity of the curriculum and the arrangement of time, and students should not be restricted to the classroom for a long time. The meaning of diligence in study should not be understood as "burning the midnight oil" or excessive tension and fatigue of "lighting lamps at the third watch and crowing chickens at the fifth watch." Artificial learning sprints or competitions should not be created. Students should not be treated like adults, sitting cross-legged and attending large classes for several hours without getting up. The meaning of children's games should be valued. Children should be organized and led to do various meaningful games and sports activities; or use the natural environment for hiking, appreciation, research, and collection activities; and encourage children to do various outdoor activities that they love and are beneficial to their physical and mental health. In carrying out teaching on labor and social activities, children should be given some tasks that they are interested in and can accomplish through all indoor and outdoor learning, from daily slight muscle movements such as making paper, wood, and clay toy handicrafts, to regular cleaning of school buildings, school equipment, wiping, sweeping, experimental plant cultivation and animal domestication, practicing sewing and washing their own clothes, and organizing some children's public welfare undertakings in a planned way for children to operate and manage themselves. Children should be regularly led to visit nearby production labor in a planned way. Older children can participate in condolence visits to revolutionary martyrs, military families, and workers' families, or write letters for others or copy news for blackboard newspapers. The meaning of labor and social activities should be explained to children from these things, and their labor concepts and interest in social service should be gradually cultivated. It is not simply dividing children with certain production tasks or competitions that must be completed, nor is it indiscriminately taking children outside the school to perform Yangko dances and dramas without considering what is happening and on what holidays, making children tired. In discipline education, it cannot be corporal punishment, corv√©e or confinement. It must be something that children can bear, understand and accept in terms of physical strength, thought and emotion. In the education of living habits, children should be trained to have regular work and rest and hygienic habits, and attention and correction should be given to everything that affects health, such as the height of tables and chairs and the posture of sitting and reading. Although the nutritional problem is not directly related to the work of teachers, it should also be concerned, so that students and parents can understand and pay attention to this principle.
            II. Children's Comprehension and Imagination Ability
    Children's thinking activities cannot exceed their own circle of life, and the things they care about most are the things they are most familiar with. Within this scope, they can use their comprehension ability. The maturity of intelligence is inseparable from life experience. Often some smart children have an intellectual age comparable to that of adults in understanding some direct and simple things, but they are still not as good as adults in some indirect and complex things. This is because children lack rich life experience. Therefore, children's thinking activities must be based on the familiar, direct, simple and concrete things.
    When faced with things beyond the scope of understanding, children have to use imagination to replace and satisfy them. Every child will produce many different imaginations. For children, the world of imagination is wonderful and beautiful. What has long been outdated or completely forgotten by adults is still a fresh and indispensable thing in children's lives. This is an artistic world full of stories, fairy tales and tales.
    Imagination and comprehension abilities rise and fall with each other. The older you get, the richer your life experience, the more rational your ingredients, and the less fantastic your ingredients. Children before the age of ten have particularly rich imaginations, and children after the age of eleven or twelve gradually break away from the fairy tale world, and their understanding and interest begin to shift towards more realistic directions.
    Attention must be paid to this situation in teaching. That is to say, in adapting to children's comprehension ability, our teaching must be centered on children's lives, teaching them things that they are familiar with, direct, and can understand and accept. Speak clearly, be specific, give appropriate examples, and use visual teaching methods as much as possible, using experiments, observations, and pictures to help children understand. The same is true in cultivating children's thoughts and feelings of right, wrong, love, and hate. When talking about landlords exploiting peasants or imperialism oppressing the Chinese people, use specific examples to explain. When talking about history, tell more specific stories. Don't talk to children about irrelevant abstract nouns and great principles, such as the "nature and driving force of revolution." No matter what the course is, you should honestly teach according to the content of the textbook, teach specifically, carefully, and clearly. Don't indiscriminately move and copy, and pull too much and too far. In terms of teaching progress, since children's comprehension is increasing with age, to improve teaching quality, we must adopt a method of deep cultivation and careful work. This is a fine and slow job. Intellectual activity is different from physical activity. Even labor competitions must be carried out on the basis of adults' physical strength. Therefore, teaching efficiency depends on normal efforts, not on temporary competitions or sprints, or teaching in order to catch up with "progress."
    The place where children's imagination reaches is also the field of our work. The teacher's responsibility is to help expand and enrich this world of imagination, guide children to read some meaningful fairy tales and tales, and help them appreciate the content of these works. Many scientific and social knowledge are often conveyed to children through these forms. Teachers should help them understand the true content of these things. This can not only enrich children's knowledge, but also stories, fairy tales, and tales themselves have various descriptive, metaphorical, or symbolic techniques, so that children can also gain a lot of wisdom in literature and art. Teachers should be careful to prevent the spread of those backward and superstitious children's reading materials in the past. (Eighteen or nineteen years ago, when comic books such as "Burning Red Lotus Temple" were popular, many children in the South wanted to go to Mount Emei to learn Taoism after reading them.) Our responsibility is to develop children's imagination and guide it on the right path.
            III. Children's Memory
    To improve learning effectiveness, in addition to having a healthy body and a certain understanding ability, it also depends on memory. The quality of memory is usually inseparable from health conditions, understanding ability, and living environment.
    Children and adults are not completely the same in memory ability. Children's memory is mostly limited to familiar direct things, and tends to be simple memory. Because they have little practical life experience, it is difficult to get opportunities to use and review them. Therefore, except for the most interesting or most prominent things that are easy to leave a deep memory, children generally do not care about indirect and complex things. However, children's lives are simple, and they easily accept whatever the environment gives them. Once the first impression is created, it is easy to form a "first impression is the strongest." Adults' memory mostly does not stop in a simple static state. Their understanding and memory are mostly combined with life practice. This kind of memory is more practical, but the complex living environment of adults often easily causes forgetting. Compared, it is still easier for children to maintain memory.
    To make what you learn remembered firmly, first of all, don't regard memory as a static preservation, but rely on frequent use and repeated practice. Secondly, memory must focus on the main points, don't be greedy for more, don't memorize by force, and don't sprint. Thirdly, various methods should be adopted anytime and anywhere and various organs of the body can be used to deepen memory.
    That is to say, students should often have the opportunity to be tested, checked, examined and reviewed. In lectures, students should be prompted to remember important places and be prepared to be tested at any time. When teaching today's material, you can connect it to the relevant material taught in this term, last term, and even last year or the year before. If the teacher cannot remember, he can also inspire the children to associate and recall themselves. Use various methods, use the brain, eyes, hands, ears, and language to strengthen memory, such as dictation, reading aloud, reciting, dictation, questions and answers, performances, and even practice with games and sports activities.
            IV. Children's Personality, Emotion and Interests
    A child is a person with the most complete personality, and these personalities are clearly expressed. The formation of these personalities is based on the child's own life.
    Imitation is the most common personality of children. Due to the limitation of life experience, attention to the surrounding things is naturally generated. Imitation is a spontaneous learning. The objects of imitation are mainly the activities of adults, followed by various common animals and some other things. Labor is the content of human life. Children often observe and imitate the activities of adults with enthusiasm. These actions are sometimes directly quoted in life, and sometimes expressed in games. The imitation of the postures, movements, and sounds of animals often appears in games. These behaviors are sometimes learned directly from the surrounding people, sometimes imitated indirectly from child to child, or learned from existing things such as a book, a painting, or a manufactured product. The scope of children's imitation is the active territory of educational work. The responsibility of education is how to make children's imitation more meaningful.
    Liking collective activities is also one of the characteristics of children. The history of mankind is a creative process of collective labor, but due to the different physical and psychological conditions, it is difficult to combine children and adults in activities. The combination of people with the same physical conditions and the same understanding, emotions, and interests is very natural. Children's physical and mental development changes greatly in childhood, so children's requirements for choosing objects are also very specific. Children of the same age and gender often like to be together. This spontaneous collective concept is a basis for educational work.
    Curiosity and exploration are also common personalities of children. Adults often lack interest in new things because of their rich experience, but children are the opposite. Curiosity and research are actually to satisfy children's own life desires. To achieve this goal, they often ask adults many difficult questions and love to hear or watch amazing stories. In order to explore the content of a certain thing, they can often endure hardship, such as climbing a tree to see the chicks. There was a famous foreign scholar who, when he was a child, used to walk past a bronze statue on the street every day. The bronze statue held a book in his hand. People said that the statue became an elf and read very carefully, turning a page every hour. Therefore, this child often stopped to watch him turn the pages. There are many examples like this among children. Sometimes, in order to observe the details of an object, they even destroy a complete toy or thing, which is regarded as destructive by adults, but in the eyes of children, it is just an experiment. From an educational point of view, this is a valuable personality.
    Liking physical activity is a very common personality of children, mainly due to physiological requirements. Because physical activity can help the growth of bones and muscles, the expansion of chest circumference, and stimulate blood circulation and gastrointestinal digestive function. This activity also naturally easily leads to approaching and learning about labor life. However, the former is always the main reason. Children's physiological conditions determine that their lifestyle must be lively and active, jumping and jumping, and it is impossible to keep them silent and sitting still all day long. The functions of life are always urging them to act. We can sometimes see that children's actions do not contain any learning significance, such as jumping while walking, climbing, knocking, shouting, tumbling, etc. These can only be explained by physiological reasons. How to adapt to this natural requirement, give play to children's physical activity, combine health education with labor and intellectual education, and make it more reasonable and meaningful is the responsibility of education.
    Self-esteem and competition are also personalities that children easily express. Being self-confident, self-respecting, maintaining one's personality and dignity, striving to be the best, and not being willing to be behind others are universal psychology of mankind and the common psychology that every nation should have. Children's self-expression is also very obvious. This is originally a noble quality, but in class society, people's lives create complex contradictions, and this personality often leads to selfishness and jealousy, forming a psychology of harming others and benefiting oneself. Children also have this psychology, but it cannot be said that this is the consciousness of the exploiting class. It can only be said that it is a primitive natural psychology. Of course, older children may also learn these things from adults. Today, we should educate children with a new outlook on life, so that they can develop this psychology of striving for progress, and that they must not only respect themselves, but also respect the people and classmates. Don't show off, don't be proud, want to compete, want to improve, and also help others. Correct behaviors should be rewarded.
    In life, satisfying self-requirements by all means is a personality that both humans and animals possess. Animals mostly use individual activities to achieve self-satisfaction in survival, while humans initially use collective labor to jointly manage social life. This means that people's self-requirements must be established on the basis of a collective and great self, which is also the difference between humans and animals. Children often show a simple, strong, and primitive desire in this regard. Children often behave dishonestly, tell lies, and take other people's things in order to satisfy their own interests. Doing such things often includes many different motives and requirements. For example, telling lies is sometimes to gain people's trust temporarily, sometimes to cover up mistakes and fear punishment. Taking other people's things is often just because they feel that the item is cute, fun, or has a certain use, and it is exactly what they lack and need, which arouses a strong desire to possess and take it as their own. Children often do not subjectively think that this is an immoral thing. Some children also know that this is bad behavior, but when their personal requirements are strong, they will forgive themselves, thinking that satisfying themselves is right and the mistake is slight. These actions of children can only be said to be a personality that starts from the primitive self-satisfaction requirements in life, and it cannot be forcibly added with a "landlord and bourgeois exploitation consciousness." Larger children may also learn these bad behaviors from adults. Teachers should carefully ask about the situation of children who have made these mistakes, study the children's psychology, discuss the problems clearly, and help them understand what is good behavior and what are bad habits. They should not be asked to examine or fight on ideological principles. Methods that are applicable to adults become irrelevant to children.
    There is also a strong children's hobby, which is art. Children's appreciation of beauty is also based on their own living environment. They love to look at pictures, love to look at the people in the pictures, especially love to look at the children in the pictures, followed by various animals and trees, flowers and plants. They like to draw themselves. Although it is most difficult to draw people, they prefer to draw people and people's actions. Children like to use bright primary colors (red, yellow, blue), especially red. They love to listen to and sing brisk tunes, waltzes and marches, love to read rhyming poems that are easy to remember, love to use colors or colored pencils to paint the illustrations in textbooks, or randomly publish their works on the walls. They love to watch dramas with lively actions and direct expressions. Although some children have not developed clean and tidy habits in life, this does not hinder their inner love of beauty. Some children show a special interest in art, not only appreciating it, but also imitating and creating it. This tells us the importance of cultivating and transforming children through art education.
    What has been said above is only the general personality of children. Although these personalities are common to children, it does not mean that every child is like this. Due to the different specific conditions of each child, such as environment, age, body, talent, habits, etc., the reflections on these personalities are not completely the same in terms of degree.
    "Individuality" refers to the general personality. Due to different specific conditions, some children may show very strong and prominent in one or several types of personality, and this personality will play a major or even decisive role in their lives. The formation of personality is mainly due to the influence of the environment.
    People's personalities cannot be forced to be consistent. The specific development of each person in their life's career is also diverse. Educational work should adapt to the general personality and also take care of individual personalities. It is impossible and unnecessary to teach everyone to be exactly the same. Some children love literature or art, some love sports, some love gardening, and some like to pay attention to and study special things. The development of these personalities can often achieve extraordinary careers. The famous nature transformer Michurin was a child who lived in an orchard from the age of four, and this environment laid the foundation for his special personality and hobbies. There was a French child who liked to study insects and collect various small stones. His mother often changed his new clothes, but his pockets were always filled with these things, and his mother did not understand him very much. One morning, three girls went to town and saw him squatting by the roadside observing ants and caves. When they returned in the afternoon, they saw him still squatting there motionless. They could not help but pity this silly child and made the sign of the cross for him. This child was the world-renowned scientist Fabre.
    Respecting children's good individuality, transforming and diluting the bad ones, and allowing good personalities to develop are what we often mention in education: developing individuality.
    Children's emotions and interests are inseparable from the existence and development of their personalities. Children's emotions and interests are expressed most directly, most obviously, and most strongly. Emotions and interests also exist in general and individual situations. How to value children's emotions and interests, inspire and guide their learning enthusiasm and interests, transform the bad ones, and help and develop upright and noble emotions and interests is the same as the education and transformation of personality.
    To help a student, a teacher should first establish a good relationship with the child. With an emotional approach, they can better understand the child's personality. The more the teacher understands the child, the deeper the relationship between teacher and student will be. A teacher who makes children feel dignified and terrible is not successful. It is easy for children to be afraid of teachers, but it is difficult for students to love teachers. Teachers must be friends with students and must not harm friendship. To achieve this, teachers themselves must have a love for children in order to resonate with children's emotions.
            V. The Impact of Environment on Children
    Although children themselves possess many important conditions, in terms of educational effect, the objective environment can play a decisive role. From the perspective of social and historical development, human labor has changed nature and also changed mankind itself. At the same time, the natural environment also affects human life. However, for children in the education period, since they are surrounded by diverse existing things that have matured, this environment greatly exceeds the scope that children can understand and control. In addition to accepting the domination and transformation of the environment, they cannot change the environment themselves.
    The environment can change children's living habits and learning interests. In the Loess Plateau of Northwest China, people live in cave dwellings, and young children often squat by the roadside "digging small cave dwellings," which is one of the game methods. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, in rural areas behind enemy lines, you could often see some very young children performing spontaneous games such as carrying stretchers, burying landmines, and arresting traitors. Song Dynasty poet Lu You's "Children do not understand farming, but also learn to plant melons beside the mulberry shade" is a description of rural children. Children who grow up in cities have more knowledge than rural children. The children of middle and upper class citizens often show some weak personalities of young masters. Workers' children, however, show a strong and bold posture. There are also many urban children who learn the habits of smoking and cursing at a very young age. The story of "Meng Mu selecting neighbors" in ancient times, regardless of her understanding, she was right about one thing, that is, the environmental education has too great an influence on children.
    The environment can determine a person's will. In revolutionary struggles, a person's class origin is often used to explain whether their attitude towards the revolution is firm or not. The vast majority of people from oppressed classes are loyal to the revolution, and this will is determined by the environment. People from other classes who can devote themselves to the revolutionary struggle are also influenced and determined by a certain environment. It is still the environment that determines who becomes the bravest and most determined person after many exercises. Children's aspirations are not innate. Teachers can combine the specific conditions of the children themselves, patiently guide them, and can give children encouragement and help, so that they can achieve special achievements and interests in certain aspects, and thus determine the direction of children's life's career. There are many such examples in the past.
    The environment can help or change innate conditions. For example, the environment has a great effect on so-called genius or low-ability children. It is a fact that everyone has different talents. But the people with the best and worst talents can only be a very small number, and the vast majority of people are basically at the same level, and the difference is not very large. Some genius children show amazing wisdom in general things, while others are limited to having special talents in certain things. If these talents are not cultivated and helped by the environment, it is difficult to develop them, and they may even disappear completely. Wang Anshi of the Song Dynasty wrote an article "Lamenting Zhongyong," which recorded and lamented that a genius child lost his talent because he did not receive good education. The intelligence and talents of most people are not easily expressed and developed from the beginning, but are successful only after being inspired, guided and cultivated by the environment. Long-term work practice makes people's understanding, experience, talent and interest deeper and richer. For most people, the emergence of genius is the process of acquired cultivation and growth. In terms of the entire history, human genius and wisdom have been constantly developed from the environment of human labor and struggle. As for the very few children with low ability, just like the very few genius children, they are both considered to be children with special congenital conditions. On the one hand, the endowment of nature exceeds the normal state, while on the other hand, the endowment is insufficient, forming a clear contrast. In addition to certain non-acquired educational effects that cannot be transformed by physiological inheritance, such as skin color, hair, epilepsy, absolute idiocy, color blindness, congenital syphilis, etc., general low-ability children, the educational environment, can still be properly helped and transformed. Therefore, the role given by the educational environment is mainly aimed at the vast majority of children. Help the general majority of children and take care of the development of individual personalities and talents.
    The environment can stimulate children to enter an early mature state. Children's early maturity can be divided into two aspects: physiological (natural) and intellectual (social). Physiological precocity is mostly formed due to natural conditions (such as the hot climate), but artificial methods such as good or bad nutrition also play a role. For example, urban children are often sexually precocious due to the influence of social life. Intellectual precocity is mostly formed by social reasons. For example, children in intellectual families can get frequent access and help from their parents, and the development of children's intelligence is often faster than that of ordinary children. For example, children growing up in revolutionary teams can influence children's political precocity due to environmental influence. We do not want to study the precocity caused by natural conditions, but we should pay attention to the precocity caused by social reasons. Some precocity is beneficial to children's development and education, such as good nutrition, cultural and political environment. However, many harmful premature behaviors in thought and behavior, such as smoking, playing cards, gambling, and some adult bad behaviors, as well as premature sexual phenomena in minors, should be paid attention to, so that children can stay away from or get rid of the environment that is harmful to them, and give them proper education. Prevent these children from spreading bad influence to other children.
    The influence of the environment on children is huge and diverse. These influences, however, occur within two major areas. Children's lives are like a dumbbell, with one end of the dumbbell being the school and the other being the family. The environment plays a role on children in these two places. To give play to the educational effect. These two ranges must be consistent. Otherwise, each will act in its own way. The school education that children receive during the day will be diluted as soon as they return home in the evening, or it will be changed again. In this way, school education will be half the effort. In terms of the role of education in the two environments, the school is of course the main one, but the influence of the family is great. Therefore, to understand children, we must also understand the family. To do children's work, we must do family work. Family work is carried out with the school as the initiative and the student's relationship as the medium. As long as this work is done, it will have an effect. The more you do, the more you harvest, and the more you do it universally, the more universally effective it will be. Not only will the teaching effect be improved, but also the progress of the family can be promoted, the connection between the school and the people can be close, and the work of the teacher can be rooted in the masses.
