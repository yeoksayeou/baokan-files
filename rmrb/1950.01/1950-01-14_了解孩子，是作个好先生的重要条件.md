    Understanding Children is an Important Condition for Being a Good Teacher
    Zhong Chun
    A good teacher, in addition to possessing revolutionary educational viewpoints and enthusiasm and confidence in their work, must also understand the children who are the objects of their work, in order to "teach according to aptitude."
    Understanding children is not a simple matter. For example, children's bodies, thoughts, personalities, emotions, hobbies, will, qualities, and even boys, girls, large, small, general, and special children should all be included. Studying these things naturally easily reminds people of courses such as "child psychology." But it is disappointing to say that it is difficult to find a readable book of this kind in the old normal school textbooks. Most of those books were bought or translated from European and American bourgeois scholars. Not only are the viewpoints problematic, but the materials are also fragmented. It would be better not to read them; opening them up only makes people more confused and it is difficult to have any help for practical work.
    Here, there is no intention to specialize in psychology, and this work remains to be completed by us from future work practice and understanding. Here we will only talk about some things about children encountered in daily work. Old psychologists also admitted that psychology is based on physiology, so let's start with this aspect:
            I. Children's Physiological Conditions
    The school-age children we refer to usually refer to children in the stage from seven to twelve years old. Before this it is called pre-school age children, thirteen to sixteen years old is called adolescence, or pre-youth period. Lower grades in elementary school (first and second grade) generally refer to children of seven or eight years old according to school age, middle grades (third and fourth grade) refer to children of nine or ten years old, and upper grades (fifth and sixth grade) refer to children of eleven or twelve years old. Single-grade elementary schools are basically lower and middle grades, and should include children from seven to ten years old, but the actual situation is often not the case. It is true that there are children of eleven or twelve years old, but students of thirteen or fourteen years old are also inevitable. Therefore, what is discussed here also includes children of eleven or twelve years old. Before the age of eleven or twelve, there is no significant difference in physiological conditions between boys and girls.
    The period from three to six or seven years old is called the early childhood period, and physiological development is extremely rapid. From seven or eight years old to eleven or twelve years old, it is called the late childhood period, and the development in this period is slower than in the previous period. The situation of its physiological development is manifested in: the development of the brain has gradually approached a mature state. Children of seven or eight years old have begun to be able to use their brains and have simple understanding, thinking, imagination, and memory of things familiar to them in daily life. By the time they are eleven or twelve years old, the brain has reached a mature state. At this time, the intellectual age of smart children often exceeds their physiological age, and they can compete with young people and adults. The following situation can be seen in the ratio of head to body length: children's heads are relatively large, especially during infancy, and this is always the case until the age of six or seven. But after the age of seven or eight, this development gradually slows down.
    The development in other aspects is very incomplete. Children's bones only begin to grow more completely in number between the ages of seven and eight (such as wrist bones). Throughout childhood, the bones have less gray matter and more collagen, making the bones small, soft and weak. If you encounter poor living or working environments at this time, it is easy to deform the bones. Deciduous teeth also only begin to be replaced at the age of seven or eight. Children's muscles are very underdeveloped, their bodies are thin, so they are light in weight, have little strength, and are prone to fatigue. The breathing volume is not large, the various internal organs are not sound, and the resistance is also weak. During this period, the two aspects of children's physiological development that are the most incomplete are bones and muscles. To cultivate a healthy physique, attention must be paid to these aspects.
    To make bones grow, muscles develop, strengthen physical strength, and increase weight, the first condition that should be paid attention to is the need for good nutrition, otherwise, it will cause serious harm to the development of the body.
    Secondly, children should have sufficient outdoor exercise. Exercise in fresh air and warm sunlight can accelerate metabolism, promote blood circulation and the development of bones and muscles, expand lung breathing volume, accelerate gastrointestinal digestive function, and enable children to develop a healthy physique.
    Thirdly, children should have sufficient sleep and rest. This is an important way to regulate children's physical and mental fatigue, restore physical strength and spirit, and in sleep and rest, the activity of various functions can be reduced, so that various parts of the body can fully perform their digestive and respiratory functions and help the body grow.
    Fourthly, life should be regular. The rise and fall, diet, work and rest, the complexity, difficulty, ease of work, mental work and physical labor, etc. all need to be properly arranged to create a normal and pleasant living environment that is neither stressful nor tiring.
    A healthy body is the foundation of learning. A strong and lively child will be good in all aspects as long as the teacher is good at teaching. A good teacher who cares about children should first care about their health.
    That is to say, in daily teaching activities, attention should be paid to the complexity of the curriculum and the arrangement of time, and students should not be restricted to the classroom for a long time. The meaning of diligence in study should not be understood as "burning the midnight oil" or excessive tension and fatigue of "lighting lamps at the third watch and crowing chickens at the fifth watch." Artificial learning sprints or competitions should not be created. Students should not be treated like adults, sitting cross-legged and attending large classes for several hours without getting up. The meaning of children's games should be valued. Children should be organized and led to do various meaningful games and sports activities; or use the natural environment for hiking, appreciation, research, and collection activities; and encourage children to do various outdoor activities that they love and are beneficial to their physical and mental health. In carrying out teaching on labor and social activities, children should be given some tasks that they are interested in and can accomplish through all indoor and outdoor learning, from daily slight muscle movements such as making paper, wood, and clay toy handicrafts, to regular cleaning of school buildings, school equipment, wiping, sweeping, experimental plant cultivation and animal domestication, practicing sewing and washing their own clothes, and organizing some children's public welfare undertakings in a planned way for children to operate and manage themselves. Children should be regularly led to visit nearby production labor in a planned way. Older children can participate in condolence visits to revolutionary martyrs, military families, and workers' families, or write letters for others or copy news for blackboard newspapers. The meaning of labor and social activities should be explained to children from these things, and their labor concepts and interest in social service should be gradually cultivated. It is not simply dividing children with certain production tasks or competitions that must be completed, nor is it indiscriminately taking children outside the school to perform Yangko dances and dramas without considering what is happening and on what holidays, making children tired. In discipline education, it cannot be corporal punishment, corvée or confinement. It must be something that children can bear, understand and accept in terms of physical strength, thought and emotion. In the education of living habits, children should be trained to have regular work and rest and hygienic habits, and attention and correction should be given to everything that affects health, such as the height of tables and chairs and the posture of sitting and reading. Although the nutritional problem is not directly related to the work of teachers, it should also be concerned, so that students and parents can understand and pay attention to this principle.
            II. Children's Comprehension and Imagination Ability
    Children's thinking activities cannot exceed their own circle of life, and the things they care about most are the things they are most familiar with. Within this scope, they can use their comprehension ability. The maturity of intelligence is inseparable from life experience. Often some smart children have an intellectual age comparable to that of adults in understanding some direct and simple things, but they are still not as good as adults in some indirect and complex things. This is because children lack rich life experience. Therefore, children's thinking activities must be based on the familiar, direct, simple and concrete things.
    When faced with things beyond the scope of understanding, children have to use imagination to replace and satisfy them. Every child will produce many different imaginations. For children, the world of imagination is wonderful and beautiful. What has long been outdated or completely forgotten by adults is still a fresh and indispensable thing in children's lives. This is an artistic world full of stories, fairy tales and tales.
    Imagination and comprehension abilities rise and fall with each other. The older you get, the richer your life experience, the more rational your ingredients, and the less fantastic your ingredients. Children before the age of ten have particularly rich imaginations, and children after the age of eleven or twelve gradually break away from the fairy tale world, and their understanding and interest begin to shift towards more realistic directions.
    Attention must be paid to this situation in teaching. That is to say, in adapting to children's comprehension ability, our teaching must be centered on children's lives, teaching them things that they are familiar with, direct, and can understand and accept. Speak clearly, be specific, give appropriate examples, and use visual teaching methods as much as possible, using experiments, observations, and pictures to help children understand. The same is true in cultivating children's thoughts and feelings of right, wrong, love, and hate. When talking about landlords exploiting peasants or imperialism oppressing the Chinese people, use specific examples to explain. When talking about history, tell more specific stories. Don't talk to children about irrelevant abstract nouns and great principles, such as the "nature and driving force of revolution." No matter what the course is, you should honestly teach according to the content of the textbook, teach specifically, carefully, and clearly. Don't indiscriminately move and copy, and pull too much and too far. In terms of teaching progress, since children's comprehension is increasing with age, to improve teaching quality, we must adopt a method of deep cultivation and careful work. This is a fine and slow job. Intellectual activity is different from physical activity. Even labor competitions must be carried out on the basis of adults' physical strength. Therefore, teaching efficiency depends on normal efforts, not on temporary competitions or sprints, or teaching in order to catch up with "progress."
    The place where children's imagination reaches is also the field of our work. The teacher's responsibility is to help expand and enrich this world of imagination, guide children to read some meaningful fairy tales and tales, and help them appreciate the content of these works. Many scientific and social knowledge are often conveyed to children through these forms. Teachers should help them understand the true content of these things. This can not only enrich children's knowledge, but also stories, fairy tales, and tales themselves have various descriptive, metaphorical, or symbolic techniques, so that children can also gain a lot of wisdom in literature and art. Teachers should be careful to prevent the spread of those backward and superstitious children's reading materials in the past. (Eighteen or nineteen years ago, when comic books such as "Burning Red Lotus Temple" were popular, many children in the South wanted to go to Mount Emei to learn Taoism after reading them.) Our responsibility is to develop children's imagination and guide it on the right path.
            III. Children's Memory
    To improve learning effectiveness, in addition to having a healthy body and a certain understanding ability, it also depends on memory. The quality of memory is usually inseparable from health conditions, understanding ability, and living environment.
    Children and adults are not completely the same in memory ability. Children's memory is mostly limited to familiar direct things, and tends to be simple memory. Because they have little practical life experience, it is difficult to get opportunities to use and review them. Therefore, except for the most interesting or most prominent things that are easy to leave a deep memory, children generally do not care about indirect and complex things. However, children's lives are simple, and they easily accept whatever the environment gives them. Once the first impression is created, it is easy to form a "first impression is the strongest." Adults' memory mostly does not stop in a simple static state. Their understanding and memory are mostly combined with life practice. This kind of memory is more practical, but the complex living environment of adults often easily causes forgetting. Compared, it is still easier for children to maintain memory.
    To make what you learn remembered firmly, first of all, don't regard memory as a static preservation, but rely on frequent use and repeated practice. Secondly, memory must focus on the main points, don't be greedy for more, don't memorize by force, and don't sprint. Thirdly, various methods should be adopted anytime and anywhere and various organs of the body can be used to deepen memory.
    That is to say, students should often have the opportunity to be tested, checked, examined and reviewed. In lectures, students should be prompted to remember important places and be prepared to be tested at any time. When teaching today's material, you can connect it to the relevant material taught in this term, last term, and even last year or the year before. If the teacher cannot remember, he can also inspire the children to associate and recall themselves. Use various methods, use the brain, eyes, hands, ears, and language to strengthen memory, such as dictation, reading aloud, reciting, dictation, questions and answers, performances, and even practice with games and sports activities.
            IV. Children's Personality, Emotion and Interests
    A child is a person with the most complete personality, and these personalities are clearly expressed. The formation of these personalities is based on the child's own life.
    Imitation is the most common personality of children. Due to the limitation of life experience, attention to the surrounding things is naturally generated. Imitation is a spontaneous learning. The objects of imitation are mainly the activities of adults, followed by various common animals and some other things. Labor is the content of human life. Children often observe and imitate the activities of adults with enthusiasm. These actions are sometimes directly quoted in life, and sometimes expressed in games. The imitation of the postures, movements, and sounds of animals often appears in games. These behaviors are sometimes learned directly from the surrounding people, sometimes imitated indirectly from child to child, or learned from existing things such as a book, a painting, or a manufactured product. The scope of children's imitation is the active territory of educational work. The responsibility of education is how to make children's imitation more meaningful.
    Liking collective activities is also one of the characteristics of children. The history of mankind is a creative process of collective labor, but due to the different physical and psychological conditions, it is difficult to combine children and adults in activities. The combination of people with the same physical conditions and the same understanding, emotions, and interests is very natural. Children's physical and mental development changes greatly in childhood, so children's requirements for choosing objects are also very specific. Children of the same age and gender often like to be together. This spontaneous collective concept is a basis for educational work.
    Curiosity and exploration are also common personalities of children. Adults often lack interest in new things because of their rich experience, but children are the opposite. Curiosity and research are actually to satisfy children's own life desires. To achieve this goal, they often ask adults many difficult questions and love to hear or watch amazing stories. In order to explore the content of a certain thing, they can often endure hardship, such as climbing a tree to see the chicks. There was a famous foreign scholar who, when he was a child, used to walk past a bronze statue on the street every day. The bronze statue held a book in his hand. People said that the statue became an elf and read very carefully, turning a page every hour. Therefore, this child often stopped to watch him turn the pages. There are many examples like this among children. Sometimes, in order to observe the details of an object, they even destroy a complete toy or thing, which is regarded as destructive by adults, but in the eyes of children, it is just an experiment. From an educational point of view, this is a valuable personality.
    Liking physical activity is a very common personality of children, mainly due to physiological requirements. Because physical activity can help the growth of bones and muscles, the expansion of chest circumference, and stimulate blood circulation and gastrointestinal digestive function. This activity also naturally easily leads to approaching and learning about labor life. However, the former is always the main reason. Children's physiological conditions determine that their lifestyle must be lively and active, jumping and jumping, and it is impossible to keep them silent and sitting still all day long. The functions of life are always urging them to act. We can sometimes see that children's actions do not contain any learning significance, such as jumping while walking, climbing, knocking, shouting, tumbling, etc. These can only be explained by physiological reasons. How to adapt to this natural requirement, give play to children's physical activity, combine health education with labor and intellectual education, and make it more reasonable and meaningful is the responsibility of education.
    Self-esteem and competition are also personalities that children easily express. Being self-confident, self-respecting, maintaining one's personality and dignity, striving to be the best, and not being willing to be behind others are universal psychology of mankind and the common psychology that every nation should have. Children's self-expression is also very obvious. This is originally a noble quality, but in class society, people's lives create complex contradictions, and this personality often leads to selfishness and jealousy, forming a psychology of harming others and benefiting oneself. Children also have this psychology, but it cannot be said that this is the consciousness of the exploiting class. It can only be said that it is a primitive natural psychology. Of course, older children may also learn these things from adults. Today, we should educate children with a new outlook on life, so that they can develop this psychology of striving for progress, and that they must not only respect themselves, but also respect the people and classmates. Don't show off, don't be proud, want to compete, want to improve, and also help others. Correct behaviors should be rewarded.
    In life, satisfying self-requirements by all means is a personality that both humans and animals possess. Animals mostly use individual activities to achieve self-satisfaction in survival, while humans initially use collective labor to jointly manage social life. This means that people's self-requirements must be established on the basis of a collective and great self, which is also the difference between humans and animals. Children often show a simple, strong, and primitive desire in this regard. Children often behave dishonestly, tell lies, and take other people's things in order to satisfy their own interests. Doing such things often includes many different motives and requirements. For example, telling lies is sometimes to gain people's trust temporarily, sometimes to cover up mistakes and fear punishment. Taking other people's things is often just because they feel that the item is cute, fun, or has a certain use, and it is exactly what they lack and need, which arouses a strong desire to possess and take it as their own. Children often do not subjectively think that this is an immoral thing. Some children also know that this is bad behavior, but when their personal requirements are strong, they will forgive themselves, thinking that satisfying themselves is right and the mistake is slight. These actions of children can only be said to be a personality that starts from the primitive self-satisfaction requirements in life, and it cannot be forcibly added with a "landlord and bourgeois exploitation consciousness." Larger children may also learn these bad behaviors from adults. Teachers should carefully ask about the situation of children who have made these mistakes, study the children's psychology, discuss the problems clearly, and help them understand what is good behavior and what are bad habits. They should not be asked to examine or fight on ideological principles. Methods that are applicable to adults become irrelevant to children.
    There is also a strong children's hobby, which is art. Children's appreciation of beauty is also based on their own living environment. They love to look at pictures, love to look at the people in the pictures, especially love to look at the children in the pictures, followed by various animals and trees, flowers and plants. They like to draw themselves. Although it is most difficult to draw people, they prefer to draw people and people's actions. Children like to use bright primary colors (red, yellow, blue), especially red. They love to listen to and sing brisk tunes, waltzes and marches, love to read rhyming poems that are easy to remember, love to use colors or colored pencils to paint the illustrations in textbooks, or randomly publish their works on the walls. They love to watch dramas with lively actions and direct expressions. Although some children have not developed clean and tidy habits in life, this does not hinder their inner love of beauty. Some children show a special interest in art, not only appreciating it, but also imitating and creating it. This tells us the importance of cultivating and transforming children through art education.
    What has been said above is only the general personality of children. Although these personalities are common to children, it does not mean that every child is like this. Due to the different specific conditions of each child, such as environment, age, body, talent, habits, etc., the reflections on these personalities are not completely the same in terms of degree.
    "Individuality" refers to the general personality. Due to different specific conditions, some children may show very strong and prominent in one or several types of personality, and this personality will play a major or even decisive role in their lives. The formation of personality is mainly due to the influence of the environment.
    People's personalities cannot be forced to be consistent. The specific development of each person in their life's career is also diverse. Educational work should adapt to the general personality and also take care of individual personalities. It is impossible and unnecessary to teach everyone to be exactly the same. Some children love literature or art, some love sports, some love gardening, and some like to pay attention to and study special things. The development of these personalities can often achieve extraordinary careers. The famous nature transformer Michurin was a child who lived in an orchard from the age of four, and this environment laid the foundation for his special personality and hobbies. There was a French child who liked to study insects and collect various small stones. His mother often changed his new clothes, but his pockets were always filled with these things, and his mother did not understand him very much. One morning, three girls went to town and saw him squatting by the roadside observing ants and caves. When they returned in the afternoon, they saw him still squatting there motionless. They could not help but pity this silly child and made the sign of the cross for him. This child was the world-renowned scientist Fabre.
    Respecting children's good individuality, transforming and diluting the bad ones, and allowing good personalities to develop are what we often mention in education: developing individuality.
    Children's emotions and interests are inseparable from the existence and development of their personalities. Children's emotions and interests are expressed most directly, most obviously, and most strongly. Emotions and interests also exist in general and individual situations. How to value children's emotions and interests, inspire and guide their learning enthusiasm and interests, transform the bad ones, and help and develop upright and noble emotions and interests is the same as the education and transformation of personality.
    To help a student, a teacher should first establish a good relationship with the child. With an emotional approach, they can better understand the child's personality. The more the teacher understands the child, the deeper the relationship between teacher and student will be. A teacher who makes children feel dignified and terrible is not successful. It is easy for children to be afraid of teachers, but it is difficult for students to love teachers. Teachers must be friends with students and must not harm friendship. To achieve this, teachers themselves must have a love for children in order to resonate with children's emotions.
            V. The Impact of Environment on Children
    Although children themselves possess many important conditions, in terms of educational effect, the objective environment can play a decisive role. From the perspective of social and historical development, human labor has changed nature and also changed mankind itself. At the same time, the natural environment also affects human life. However, for children in the education period, since they are surrounded by diverse existing things that have matured, this environment greatly exceeds the scope that children can understand and control. In addition to accepting the domination and transformation of the environment, they cannot change the environment themselves.
    The environment can change children's living habits and learning interests. In the Loess Plateau of Northwest China, people live in cave dwellings, and young children often squat by the roadside "digging small cave dwellings," which is one of the game methods. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, in rural areas behind enemy lines, you could often see some very young children performing spontaneous games such as carrying stretchers, burying landmines, and arresting traitors. Song Dynasty poet Lu You's "Children do not understand farming, but also learn to plant melons beside the mulberry shade" is a description of rural children. Children who grow up in cities have more knowledge than rural children. The children of middle and upper class citizens often show some weak personalities of young masters. Workers' children, however, show a strong and bold posture. There are also many urban children who learn the habits of smoking and cursing at a very young age. The story of "Meng Mu selecting neighbors" in ancient times, regardless of her understanding, she was right about one thing, that is, the environmental education has too great an influence on children.
    The environment can determine a person's will. In revolutionary struggles, a person's class origin is often used to explain whether their attitude towards the revolution is firm or not. The vast majority of people from oppressed classes are loyal to the revolution, and this will is determined by the environment. People from other classes who can devote themselves to the revolutionary struggle are also influenced and determined by a certain environment. It is still the environment that determines who becomes the bravest and most determined person after many exercises. Children's aspirations are not innate. Teachers can combine the specific conditions of the children themselves, patiently guide them, and can give children encouragement and help, so that they can achieve special achievements and interests in certain aspects, and thus determine the direction of children's life's career. There are many such examples in the past.
    The environment can help or change innate conditions. For example, the environment has a great effect on so-called genius or low-ability children. It is a fact that everyone has different talents. But the people with the best and worst talents can only be a very small number, and the vast majority of people are basically at the same level, and the difference is not very large. Some genius children show amazing wisdom in general things, while others are limited to having special talents in certain things. If these talents are not cultivated and helped by the environment, it is difficult to develop them, and they may even disappear completely. Wang Anshi of the Song Dynasty wrote an article "Lamenting Zhongyong," which recorded and lamented that a genius child lost his talent because he did not receive good education. The intelligence and talents of most people are not easily expressed and developed from the beginning, but are successful only after being inspired, guided and cultivated by the environment. Long-term work practice makes people's understanding, experience, talent and interest deeper and richer. For most people, the emergence of genius is the process of acquired cultivation and growth. In terms of the entire history, human genius and wisdom have been constantly developed from the environment of human labor and struggle. As for the very few children with low ability, just like the very few genius children, they are both considered to be children with special congenital conditions. On the one hand, the endowment of nature exceeds the normal state, while on the other hand, the endowment is insufficient, forming a clear contrast. In addition to certain non-acquired educational effects that cannot be transformed by physiological inheritance, such as skin color, hair, epilepsy, absolute idiocy, color blindness, congenital syphilis, etc., general low-ability children, the educational environment, can still be properly helped and transformed. Therefore, the role given by the educational environment is mainly aimed at the vast majority of children. Help the general majority of children and take care of the development of individual personalities and talents.
    The environment can stimulate children to enter an early mature state. Children's early maturity can be divided into two aspects: physiological (natural) and intellectual (social). Physiological precocity is mostly formed due to natural conditions (such as the hot climate), but artificial methods such as good or bad nutrition also play a role. For example, urban children are often sexually precocious due to the influence of social life. Intellectual precocity is mostly formed by social reasons. For example, children in intellectual families can get frequent access and help from their parents, and the development of children's intelligence is often faster than that of ordinary children. For example, children growing up in revolutionary teams can influence children's political precocity due to environmental influence. We do not want to study the precocity caused by natural conditions, but we should pay attention to the precocity caused by social reasons. Some precocity is beneficial to children's development and education, such as good nutrition, cultural and political environment. However, many harmful premature behaviors in thought and behavior, such as smoking, playing cards, gambling, and some adult bad behaviors, as well as premature sexual phenomena in minors, should be paid attention to, so that children can stay away from or get rid of the environment that is harmful to them, and give them proper education. Prevent these children from spreading bad influence to other children.
    The influence of the environment on children is huge and diverse. These influences, however, occur within two major areas. Children's lives are like a dumbbell, with one end of the dumbbell being the school and the other being the family. The environment plays a role on children in these two places. To give play to the educational effect. These two ranges must be consistent. Otherwise, each will act in its own way. The school education that children receive during the day will be diluted as soon as they return home in the evening, or it will be changed again. In this way, school education will be half the effort. In terms of the role of education in the two environments, the school is of course the main one, but the influence of the family is great. Therefore, to understand children, we must also understand the family. To do children's work, we must do family work. Family work is carried out with the school as the initiative and the student's relationship as the medium. As long as this work is done, it will have an effect. The more you do, the more you harvest, and the more you do it universally, the more universally effective it will be. Not only will the teaching effect be improved, but also the progress of the family can be promoted, the connection between the school and the people can be close, and the work of the teacher can be rooted in the masses.

    了解孩子，是作个好先生的重要条件
    仲纯
    一位好教师，具备了革命的教育观点，对工作有热情和信心之外，还须了解作为工作对象的孩子们，以便“因人施教”。
    了解孩子不是简单的事。如：儿童的身体、思想、性格、感情、爱好、意志、品质，以至男、女、大、小、一般的和特殊的儿童等都应包括在内。要研究这些，自然很容易使人想起“儿童心理学”一类的课本来。但是说起来却使人失望，在旧的师范课本里，就很难找到一本可读的这样的书籍。那些书十有八九是从欧美资产阶级的学者先生们那里贩买或抄译来的。不仅观点成问题，而且材料又零乱破碎，不读它倒也罢了，打开一看，倒使人越读越糊涂起来，对实际工作很难有帮助。
    这里并不打算专门来研究心理学，而且这一工作还有待于我们从今后不断的工作实践和认识中来完成它。在这里只谈一些日常工作中遇到的，对于孩子们的事情。旧日的心理学家也承认：心理学是建立在生理学的基础之上的，好吧，让我们就从这方面谈起：
            一、儿童的生理条件
    我们所称的学龄儿童，通常是指从七岁到十二岁这一阶段的孩子们。在这以前称为学龄前儿童，十三岁到十六岁称为少年时期，或称前青年期。小学里的低年生（一、二年级），按学龄说，一般是指七、八岁的儿童，中年生（三、四年级）是指九、十岁的儿童，高年生（五、六年级）是指十一、二岁的儿童。单级小学基本上都是低，中年级，应该包括自七——十岁的儿童，但实际情况往往并不如此，十一、二岁的儿童固然有，而十三、四岁的学生也难免。因此，这里所谈的，也包括十一、二岁的儿童在内。十一、二岁以前的男女儿童，在生理条件上来说，并无显著的差别。
    从三岁到六、七岁被称为儿童前期，生理上的发育极快，从七、八岁到十一、二岁，被称为儿童后期，这一时期的发育比较前一时期要缓慢些。其生理发育的情形表现在：大脑的发达已渐接近成熟状态，七、八岁的儿童，已开始能运用头脑，对日常生活中所熟悉的事物具有简单的理解、思考、想像和记忆的能力。到了十一、二岁时，则大脑已达到成熟状态，聪明的儿童，在此时期，其智力年龄往往超过了他们的生理年龄，而可以和青年与成人比一比高下了。在头部与身长的比例上可以看出如下的情形：儿童的头部比较大，尤其是婴孩时期，一直到六、七岁之间，始终表现着如此。但到七、八岁以后，这一发展便渐渐缓慢下来。
    其他方面的发育都很不完全，儿童的骨骼在七、八岁之间，才开始在数量上成长得比较完全（如腕骨等），整个儿童时期骨骼里灰质少，胶质多，使得骨骼细小，软而无力。这时如果遇到不良的生活或工作环境，很容易使骨骼变形。乳齿也是在七、八岁时才开始换去。儿童的肌肉很不发达，身体瘦削，因此体重轻，力气小，易于疲劳。呼吸量不大，内脏各种器官也不健全，抵抗力也弱。在这一时期，儿童生理上发育得最不完全的就是骨骼和肌肉两方面。培养一个健全的体格，就得从这几方面加以注意。
    要使骨骼成长，肌肉发达，加强体力，增加体重，应当注意的条件首先是需要有很好的营养，否则，对身体的发育会造成严重的妨害。
    其次是要让儿童有充分的室外运动，在新鲜的空气和温暖的阳光之下的运动，能加速新陈代谢的作用，促进血液的循环与骨骼、肌肉的发展，扩大肺的呼吸量，加速胃肠的消化机能，使儿童能养成健美的体格。
    第三是让儿童有充分的睡眠和休息，这是调剂儿童心身疲劳，恢复体力和精神的重要办法，而且在睡眠与休息中，可使各种机能的活动减少，使身体各部门尽其消化与呼吸的作用，帮助身体的成长。
    第四是要使生活有规律，起居、饮食、作息、工作的繁、简、难、易，脑力工作和体力劳动等都需要给以适当的安排，造成一个既不紧张也不疲劳的正常、愉快的生活环境。
    健康的身体是学习的基础，一个强壮活泼的孩子，只要老师善于教导，他在各方面都会是不错的。一个关心孩子的好老师，首先就应关心孩子们的健康。
    这就是说，在日常的教学活动中，应该注意到课程的繁简和时间的安排，不要长时间地把学生限制在教室内。不要把勤学意义理解为“开夜车”或是“三更灯火五更鸡”的过分紧张和疲劳，不要造成人为的学习突击或竞赛，不要把学生当作大人一样，盘膝而坐，上大课，几个钟头不起来，应重视儿童游戏的意义，组织和领导儿童们作各种有意义的游戏及体育活动；或者利用自然环境，作远足、鉴赏、研究、和采集等活动，鼓励儿童作他们所喜爱的有益于身心的各种室外活动。在进行关于劳动与社会活动的教学上，应该是透过室内和室外的一切学习，给予儿童们以有兴趣和可能办到的一些任务，从日常轻微的肌肉动作如制作纸、木、泥类的玩具手工，到经常整理校舍、校具、擦洗、扫除，作实验性的植物栽培与动物驯养，练习缝洗自己的衣服，有计划地组织一些儿童公共的福利事业让孩子们自己经营和管理，经常有计划地带领儿童参观附近的生产劳动，大孩子可以参加慰问烈、军、工属或者替人家写信或给黑板报抄写新闻等。从这些事情中向儿童们说明劳动和社会活动的意义，逐渐培养他们的劳动观念与社会服务的兴趣。而不是生硬地分给儿童以一定的生产任务或竞赛，非完成不可，也不是不分什么事情和节日，随便地把孩子们弄到校外去扭秧歌、演剧使儿童们落得一身疲乏。在纪律教育上，不能是体罚、劳役或禁闭。而必须是使儿童在体力、思想和感情上能够担负、理解和接受的事情。在生活习惯的教育上，要养成孩子们按时作息，清洁卫生的习惯，以至桌椅的高低，坐位与阅写的姿势，凡足以影响健康的都要予以注意和改正。在营养问题上，虽然和教员的工作没有直接关系，但同样应该关心，使学生和家长能懂得并注意这个道理。
            二、儿童的理解和想像能力
    儿童的思想活动不能超过他们自己的生活圈子，他们所最关心的事情也就是他们所最熟悉的事情，在这个范围之内去运用他们的理解能力。智力的成熟又是与生活的经验分不开的。往往有些聪明的儿童在对于一些直接、单纯的事物的理解之上，其智龄可以和成人比拟，但对于一些间接的、复杂的事物，还是赶不上成年人，这是由于儿童缺乏丰富的生活经验所致。因此，孩子们的思想活动就不能不建立在他们所熟悉的、直接的、单纯的和具体的事物之上。
    在对超出理解范围的事物时，儿童便只好以想像来代替和满足了，每个儿童都会产生许多不同的想像来。对于儿童来说，想像中的世界是奇妙和美丽的。在成年人早已过时了或是完全忘记了的，在儿童生活中却依然是一种新鲜的不能缺少的东西，这是一个充满故事、童话和物语的艺术世界。
    想像能力和理解能力是互相消长的。年龄愈大，生活的经历愈丰富，理智的成份愈多，则空想的成份愈少。十岁以前的儿童想像力特别丰富，到十一、二岁以后的儿童，已逐渐脱离童话世界，理解和兴趣开始向着更现实方向转移。
    在教学上须注意这种情况。这就是说：在适应儿童的理解能力上，我们的教学必须是以儿童的生活作中心，教给他们所熟悉的，直接的，能理解和接受的事情。说话要明白，意见要具体，举例要恰当，尽可能采取直观教学的方法，用实验、观察、图画来帮助儿童的理解。在培养儿童的是、非、爱、憎的思想感情上也是如此，讲地主剥削农民也好，讲帝国主义压迫中国人民也好，就引用具体的例子来解说，在讲历史时，就要多讲具体的故事，不要向小孩子去讲那些不相干的抽象名词和大道理，像什么“革命的性质与动力”之类。不论什么课程，应该老老实实照着教材的内容去教，教具体、教仔细、教明白，不要滥搬滥套，扯得又多又远。在教学进度上来说，既然儿童的理解力是与年俱进的，那么要提高教学质量，就得采取深耕细作的办法，这是精细、缓慢的工作。智力活动不同于体力活动，就是劳动竞赛也必须是在成年人的体力基础之上来进行的。因此教学效率决定于平时的努力，而不靠临时的竞赛或突击，或是为了赶“进度”而教学。
    儿童的想像力所及之处，也是我们工作的领域。教师的责任就在于帮助扩大和丰富这一想像世界，指导孩子们阅读一些有意义的童话和物语，帮助他们去欣赏这些作品的内容。许多科学知识和社会知识，往往都是通过这些形式来向小孩传达的。教师应该帮助他们去了解这些东西的真正内容。这样不仅能丰富儿童的知识，并且故事、童话、物语本身还具备各种描写，比喻或象征的手法，使儿童在文学和艺术上也能得到不少的智慧。教师们要留心防止过去那些落后与迷信的儿童读物的流传。（十八、九年以前，当“火烧红莲寺”一类的小人书流行时，在南方有许多孩子们看了竟要到峨嵋山去学道，）我们的责任是在把孩子们的想像能力加以发挥并引到正确的路上。
            三、儿童的记忆
    要提高学习效能，除了具备健康的身体和一定的理解能力之外，还要靠记忆，记忆力的好坏通常是与健康条件、理解能力和生活环境等分不开的。
    儿童与成人在记忆能力上是不尽相同的。孩子们的记忆多限于所熟悉的直接的事物，且偏于单纯的记忆，因为实际生活的经验少，很不容易得到运用和温习的机会，因此除了最有趣味或最突出的事情容易留下深刻的记忆外，一般间接而复杂的事物，儿童是不大关心的。但儿童的生活单纯，环境给他什么，他就容易接受什么，第一个印象一经造成，就容易形成“先入为主”。成人的记忆，多半不停在单纯的静止的状态上，他的理解和记忆多半与生活的实践结合起来的。这种记忆比较踏实，但成人复杂的生活环境，又往往容易造成遗忘。比较起来，还是儿童容易保持记忆。
    要使学来的东西记得扎实，首先是不要把记忆当成一种静止的保存，靠经常运用和反复练习。其次，记忆须着重要点，不要贪多，不要强记，不要突击。第三是要随时随地采用各种方式并使身体上各种器官都能运用起来加深记忆。
    这就是说，应该让学生经常得到被测验、检查、考试与复习的机会。在讲课中，随时提示学生，记住重要的地方，准备随时受测验。讲今天的材料，可以联系到本期，上期以至去年前年所讲过的有关材料，教员记不起来，还可以启发儿童们自己来联想和回忆。用各种方法，用脑、用眼、用手、用耳、用语言来加强记忆，如默写、朗读、背诵、听写、问答、表演、以至配合游戏体育等活动来练习。
            四、儿童的性格、感情和趣味
    儿童是一种具有最完全的性格的人，这些性格表现得很明显。这些性格的形成，是以儿童自己的生活为出发点的。
    模仿是儿童最普遍的一种性格，由于生活经验的限制，便自然地产生了对周围事物的注意，模仿是一种自发的学习。模仿的对象主要是成人的活动，其次是常见的各种动物和一些别的事情。劳动是人类生活的内容，孩子们对于大人们的活动常常是热心地观察和模仿的，这些举动有时直接引用到生活中，有时又表现在游戏上。对于动物的姿态、动作和声音的模仿常出现在游戏中。这些行为有时是直接向周围的人物学来的，有时是间接地孩子向孩子模仿来的，或者是从现存的事物如一本书，一张画或一件制成品上学来的。儿童的模仿范围，就是教育工作的活动地盘。教育上的责任，是怎样使儿童的模仿更有意义。
    喜欢集体活动也是儿童的特征之一。人类的历史，就是一个集体劳动的创造过程，但由于身理和心理状态的不同，要把儿童和成人们结合在一起活动是困难的。同样的体力条件而又怀着同样的认识、感情和兴趣的人这种结合是很自然的。儿童时期身心发育的变化很大，因此，孩子们在选择对象的要求上也表现得很具体，往往同年龄、同性别的孩子喜欢在一起。这种自发的集体观念，是教育工作上的一个依据。
    好奇和探究也是孩子们同具的性格。成人往往借着丰富的阅历，对新事物缺少兴趣，小孩子正相反。好奇和研究，实际是为了满足孩子们自己的生活欲望，为了达到这一目的，常常对大人发出许多难以解答的问题，爱听或爱看惊奇的故事，为了探究某一事物的内容，往往可以不辞辛苦，如像爬到树上去探视鸟雏等情形。从前有个外国著名学者，当他小时，每天要从街上一座铜像旁边走过，那铜像的手里拿一本书，人们传说这座雕像成了精灵，读书很仔细，每过一点钟才翻一页。因此这小孩就时常地停下来，等待观看他翻书的动作。像这一类的例子，在孩子们中是不少的。有时为了观察一件东西的究竟，甚至把一个完整的玩具或东西拆毁了，被大人看成是一种破坏性，但在孩子看来不过一种实验罢了。这从教育上说，却是可贵的性格。
    爱好体力活动，是极普遍的儿童性格，这主要是由于生理的要求。因为身体活动能帮助骨骼和肌肉的成长，胸围的扩大，刺激血液循环和肠胃的消化功能。这一活动同时也自然容易引起对劳动生活的接近和学习。不过前者始终是主要的原因。儿童的生理条件，决定了他的生活方式必须是活活泼泼，跳跳蹦蹦的，无法使他整天沉默静座，生活的机能，随时在催促他行动。我们有时可以看到儿童的动作并不含有任何的学习意义，如像一面走路一面跳跃，随便攀缘、敲打、喊叫、翻翻筋斗等等，这些只能用生理的原因来解释。怎样适应这一自然的要求，发挥儿童的体力活动，把健康教育和劳动、智力教育结合起来，使它更合理和更有意义，这便是教育上的责任。
    自尊和竞争，也是儿童容易表现的性格。自信、自重，维护自己的人格与尊严，争奇好胜，不甘居人后，这是人类的普遍心理，也是每一个民族所应具备的共同心理。小孩子们的这种自我表现也很明显。这本来是一种高贵的品质，可是在阶级社会里，人们的生活造成错综复杂的矛盾，这一性格往往流于自私和嫉妒，形成损人利己的心理。儿童也有这种心理，但不能说这就是剥削阶级的意识。只能说是一种原始的自然心理。当然，较大的儿童也可能向成人学会这些事情。今天我们应该用新人生观来教育儿童，使他们发扬这种力求上进的心理，并且是既要自尊，也要尊重人民和同学。不自炫，不骄傲，要竞争，要向上，也要帮助别人，对于正确的行为应该奖励。
    在生活中，用一切方法去满足自我要求，这是人类以至动物都具有的性格。动物多半是以个体的活动，来达到生存上的自我满足，而人类一开始便是以集体的劳动来共营社会生活的。这便是人的自我要求必须建立在一个集体的、大我的基础之上，也是人与动物之间不同的一点。儿童们在这一点上，往往表现了一种单纯的、强烈的、原始的欲望。儿童们为了满足自己的利益，往往表现不老实，说诳话，拿别人的东西等行为。作这种事情，往往包括许多不同的动机和要求在内，如说诳话，有时是为了一时取信于人，有时为了掩饰过失和怕受处分，拿别人的东西，往往只是感到该物品可爱，好玩，或者有一定的用处，而又恰是自己所缺少所需要的，引起了强烈的占有欲，并据为己有。孩子们在主观上往往并不认为这就是不道德的事，有的儿童也知道这是不良的行为，但当他个人要求强烈的时候，他会自己原谅自己，认为满足自己是应该的错误是轻微的，儿童的这些行动，只能说是从生活上原始的自我满足的要求出发的一种性格，同样也不能硬给加上一个“地主、资产阶级的剥削意识。”大些的孩子还可能从成人那里学来这些坏行为。教员对于犯了这些错误的孩子，是应该好好问明情况，研究孩子的心理，谈清问题，帮助他们了解什么是好行为，那些是坏习惯，不应提到思想原则上去检讨或斗争。适用于成人的方法，到了小孩子身上便变成不相干的事了。
    还有一种强烈的儿童爱好，那便是艺术。小孩子对美的欣赏也是根据自己的生活环境出发的。他们爱看图画，爱看画中的人物，尤其爱看画上的小孩子，其次则是各种动物和树木花草。他们喜欢自己动手画，虽然画人是最不容易的，他们却偏爱画人和人们的动作。孩子们喜欢用鲜明的原色（红、黄、蓝），尤其喜欢红色。他们爱听和爱唱节奏鲜明的小调、圆舞曲和进行曲，爱读有韵的容易上口的诗歌，爱用颜色或颜色铅笔等东西在课本的插图上涂染，或是在墙壁上随便发表自己的作品。他们爱看动作热闹、表情直接的戏剧。虽然有的孩子在生活上并未养成清洁整齐的习惯，可是这并不妨害他们内心对美的爱好。有些儿童对艺术表示特殊爱好，不仅是欣赏，而且能模仿和创作。这告诉我们通过艺术教育去培养与改造儿童的重要。
    以上所说，只是儿童的一般性格，这些性格虽是儿童所共有的，但不见得每个孩子都如此。由于每个儿童的环境、年龄、身体、天资、习惯等具体条件的不同，对于这些性格的反映，在程度上来说是不完全相同的。
    “个性”——是指对一般的性格而言。由于具体条件的不同，有的儿童会在某一种或几种类型的性格上，表现得非常强烈和突出，而且这种性格将在他的生活中起主要的甚至决定的作用。个性的形成，主要是由于环境的影响。
    人们的性格，是不可能强求一致的。各人在一生事业中的具体发展也是多样的，教育工作要适应一般的性格，也要照顾个别的性格，不可能也不必要把每个人都教成一模一样。有的儿童爱好文学或艺术，有的爱好体育，有的喜欢园艺，有的喜欢对于特殊的事物加以注意和研究。这些性格的发展，往往可以成就非常的事业。有名的自然改造者米邱林，便是一个从四岁起就生活在果树园中的孩子，这一环境奠定了他特殊的性格和爱好。从前有一个法国小孩子，喜欢研究昆虫和搜集各种小石子，母亲常给他换新衣，可是他的口袋里经常装满了这些东西，妈妈很不了解他。有天早晨，三个姑娘进城去，看见他蹲在路边观察蚂蚁和洞穴，下午他们回来时，见他仍就蹲在那里不动，她们不禁可怜这傻孩子起来，给他划十字。这个孩子就是以后举世闻名的科学家法布尔。
    尊重儿童的优良个性，把不好的加以改造和冲淡，让好的性格得到发扬，这便是我们在教育上所常提到的一件事：发展个性。
    儿童的感情和趣味，是与他们性格的存在和发展分不开的。儿童的感情和兴趣的表现最直接、最明显也最强烈。感情与兴趣同样地存在着一般的与个别的情况，怎样重视儿童的感情和趣味，启发和引导他们的学习热情与兴趣。让不好的得以改造，使正直高尚的感情和兴趣得到帮助与发展，这和对性格的教育与改造是一样的。
    教员要帮助一个学生，首先应该和儿童建立良好的感情，有了感情上的接近，才能更好地去了解儿童的性格，教员愈了解儿童，则师生的感情会更深厚起来。一个使儿童感觉威严可怕的老师，这并不是成功。要儿童怕教员很容易，要学生爱老师就困难了。教员必须和学生作朋友，不要伤害友谊，要作到这一点，教师自己必须具有热爱儿童的感情，才能和儿童的感情共鸣起来。
            五、环境对于儿童的影响
    尽管儿童本身具备着许多重要的条件，但在教育效果上说，客观环境却能起决定作用。从社会历史的发展来看，人类的劳动改变了自然，也改变了人类自己，同时自然环境也给予人类的生活以影响。但对于受教育时期的儿童来讲，由于周围都是已经成熟了的多样的现存事物在包围着他，这种环境大大地超过了儿童所能理解与控制的范围，儿童除了接受环境的支配与改造外，他自己是无法去改变环境的。
    环境会改变孩子们的生活习惯与学习兴趣。在我国西北的黄土高原上，人民住的都是窑洞，幼童们常蹲在路边，“掏小窑窑”，便是游戏的方法之一。抗战期中，在敌后的农村里，时常可以看见一些很小的孩子表演抬担架、埋地雷、抓汉奸等自发的游戏。宋朝诗人陆放翁的“儿童未解躬耕识，也傍桑阴学种瓜。”就是描写农村儿童的。生长在城市里的孩子，见识要比农村儿童多，中上层市民子弟，往往表现一些小少爷的文弱性格。工人子弟却显着粗壮豪放的姿态。还有许多城市孩子，很小就学会了抽烟、骂人的习惯。古时“孟母择邻”的故事，不管她的认识如何，但有一点她是看得对的，那便是环境给儿童的教育影响太大。
    环境可以决定一个人的意志。在革命斗争中，往往由一个人的出身成份来说明他对革命的态度坚决与否，出身于受压迫阶级的人，对革命绝大多数是忠诚的，这种意志是由环境来决定的。出身于其他阶级的人，而能投身到革命斗争中，也是由于一定的环境所影响和决定的。经过许多锻炼，而成为最勇敢最坚决的人，仍然是由环境来决定的。孩子们的志愿并非天赋的，老师能结合儿童本身的具体条件，循循善诱，能够给儿童以鼓励和帮助，使他能在某些方面获得特殊的成绩与兴趣，因而决定了儿童一生事业的方向，这种例子，过去是不少的。
    环境可以帮助或改变天赋的条件。譬如所谓天才或低能的儿童，环境对于他们的作用是极大的。每个人的禀赋不同，这是事实。但天资最好和最坏的人只能是极少数，绝大多数人基本上是在同一水平，其差别是不大悬殊的。天才的儿童有的表现在对于一般事物上具备着惊人的智慧，也有的只限于对某一种事物上具有特殊的才能。这些才能如果得不到环境的培养和帮助，是很难发展的，甚至完全消失掉。宋朝的王安石曾写过一篇《伤仲永》的文章，那就记述和叹息一个天才儿童因得不到好的教养而失去了他的才能。多数人的聪明才智不是一开始就很容易表现和发展起来的，是要经过环境的启发、诱导与培养才成功的。长期的工作实践，使人的理解、经验、才能和兴趣更深远更丰富起来。对大多数人来说，天才的产生，就是后天的培养与成长的过程。就整个历史来说，人类的天才和智慧，就是从人类的劳动与斗争的环境中不断地发展起来的。至于极少数的低能儿童，正像极少数的天才儿童一样，同算是先天特殊的儿童。一方面是自然的赋予超出了正常状态，而另一方面却是赋予不足，形成了鲜明的对照。环境的教育和影响除了对生理上所遗传下来某些非后天的教育效果所能改造者如肤色、毛发、疯痫、绝对的白痴、色盲、先天的梅毒等以外，一般低能儿童，环境的教育，还是能加以适当的帮助与改造的。因此教育环境所给予的作用主要是对着绝大多数的孩子而言。帮助一般的多数的儿童，并照顾个别的性格与才能的发展。
    环境可以刺激儿童进入早熟状态。儿童的早熟可以分为生理的（自然的）和智力的（社会的）两方面，生理的早熟，多半由于自然的条件（如气候的炎热等）所形成，但人工的方法如营养的好坏也有作用。又如城市的儿童由于社会生活的影响，往往造成性的早熟等都是。智力的早熟，多半是社会的原因所形成。如知识分子家庭的子女，能得到父母的经常接近与帮助，则儿童智力的发展，往往比一般儿童快，又如生长在革命队伍里的儿童，由于环境的薰陶，能影响孩子们在政治上的早熟。自然条件所造成的早熟，不是我们所要研究的，但社会原因所引起的早熟，我们却应该予以注意。有些早熟，对于儿童的发育和教育是有好处的，如好的营养、文化和政治环境的薰陶等。而对许多有害的思想行为上的早熟如抽烟、打牌、赌博等表现一些成人的不好的行动，以及未成年的性的早熟现象等，则应加以注意，让孩子疏远或脱离对他们有害的环境，并给以正当的教育。防止这些儿童对其他儿童传布坏影响。
    环境对于儿童的影响是巨大的，同时也是多样的。这些影响却是从两大范围之内发生的，儿童的生活是哑铃式的，这哑铃的一端是学校，另一端便是家庭。环境对儿童起作用的便是这样两个地方。要发挥教育上的效果。就必须这两个范围配合一致。否则各行其是，儿童白天受到的学校教育，晚上一回家便被冲淡了，或是又换了样，这样一来学校教育便事倍功半了。两个环境在教育的作用上说，当然学校是主要的，但家庭的影响却很大。所以要了解儿童，还得了解家庭，要作儿童工作，就得作家庭工作。家庭工作是以学校作为主动而以学生的关系作媒介来进行的。这一工作只要作就会有效果。多作多收效，普遍作就普遍生效。不仅教学效果会提高，同时也可以推动家庭的进步，密切了学校和人民的联系，而且使老师的工作在群众中扎下根来。
