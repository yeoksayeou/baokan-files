The Peking University Student Union is beginning to deploy winter vacation work. Based on the principle of half study and half rest, the Student Union calls on students remaining on campus to actively participate in cultural and recreational activities organized by various departments and institutes, and to review the courses taught at any time to strengthen their political studies. The Engineering College Student Union calls on students to go to bed early and get up early, save water and electricity, and move the original exercise break to 8:00 am. The University Student Union has also hired celebrities to give lectures during the holidays: Hu Hua will speak on "History of the Chinese Revolution" (January 27, at the Engineering College), He Sijing will speak on "International Issues" (January 29, at Sand Beach), Li Lisan will speak on "International Issues" (February 2, at Sand Beach), Di Chaobai will speak on "1950 Fiscal Policy" (February 8, at Sand Beach), Hu Sheng will speak on "Revolutionary Worldview" (February 14, at Sand Beach), and Gao Tang will speak on "Youth Issues" (February 22).

    北大学生会布置寒假工作
    请胡华等作专题讲演
    【本报讯】北京大学学生开始布置寒假工作。该校学生会根据一半学习一半休息的原则号召留校同学尽量参加各院所主办的文化娱乐活动，并随时温习讲过的课程，加强政治学习。工学院学生会号召同学早睡早起，节水节电，把原来的课间操提到早八点开始。全校学生会并已聘妥名人在假期做演讲：请胡华讲《中国革命史》（一月二十七日，在工学院），何思敬讲“国际问题”（二十九日，在沙滩），李立三讲“国际问题”（二月二日，在沙滩），狄超白讲“一九五○年财政政策”（八日，在沙滩），胡绳讲“革命人生观”（十四日，在沙滩），高棠讲“青年问题”（二十二日）。
