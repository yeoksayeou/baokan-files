Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th -- China's various democratic parties issued a statement to endorse Foreign Minister Zhou's January 8th telegram to the United Nations, requesting the expulsion of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionary group's representatives from the United Nations Security Council, as follows:

    Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, sent a telegram on January 8th to Mr. Romulo, President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, and forwarded it to the governments of the member states of the Security Council: the Soviet Union, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Ecuador, India, Cuba, Egypt, and Norway. The telegram stated that the presence of representatives of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionary remnant group in the United Nations Security Council is illegal and advocated for their expulsion from the Security Council. We, the various democratic parties of the People's Republic of China, hereby jointly solemnly declare to the world that we recognize that Foreign Minister Zhou's stern and righteous telegram truly represents the public will of the entire Chinese people, and we unanimously and resolutely support Minister Zhou's proposition.

    On November 15, 1949, Foreign Minister Zhou telegraphed Mr. Romulo, President of the United Nations, and Mr. Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, formally denying the legitimacy of the delegation led by Jiang Tingfu, dispatched by the so-called "Chinese Kuomintang Government" attending the General Assembly at that time, declaring that they could not represent China, and requesting the United Nations to "immediately revoke the qualifications of Jiang Tingfu et al. and all their rights to participate in the meeting, in accordance with the principles and spirit of the United Nations Charter," to comply with the wishes of the Chinese people. The delegations of our friendly countries, the Soviet Union and Poland, have repeatedly drawn the attention of the General Assembly to this issue based on Minister Zhou's statement, and the Soviet delegation also proposed denying the status of the so-called "Chinese Kuomintang Government" representative. Unfortunately, these just demands were obstructed by the U.S. imperialist clique and could not be realized, which greatly disappointed us, the Chinese people, with such a United Nations.

    Now, the Jiang Tingfu delegation participating in the United Nations Security Council has long lost the qualifications to represent China. The so-called "Chinese Kuomintang Government" puppet regime of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionary group it represents has long been disintegrated. Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren have become bandits and fugitives. This puppet regime practically no longer exists, a fact known to the world. To retain a ghost of this thoroughly deceased puppet regime in the United Nations and its Security Council, staging a puppet farce there, and even serving as the President of the Security Council, is not only an unprecedented and extremely great farce in the history of international politics but also a great insult to the United Nations and even a greater insult to us, the Chinese people. This is intolerable; what is tolerable?

    Therefore, we demand that the member states of the United Nations Security Council respect the public will of us, the Chinese people, accept the proposal of our Foreign Minister Zhou, and immediately expel the so-called delegation of Jiang Tingfu from the meeting. At the same time, we solemnly warn the U.S. imperialist clique that if they continue to play with the United Nations, and foster and support the ghost delegation of Jiang Tingfu and his like in staging a puppet farce in the United Nations, this is unacceptable to the Chinese people, and the U.S. imperialists shall bear full responsibility for all the consequences. This is hereby announced.

### 各民主党派联合发表公告  拥护周外长声明  警告美帝集团勿豢养鬼影代表团

    各民主党派联合发表公告
    拥护周外长声明
    警告美帝集团勿豢养鬼影代表团
    【新华社北京十三日电】中国各民主党派为拥护周外长一月八日致电联合国请驱逐中国国民党反动集团代表出联合国安全理事会发表声明如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部周恩来部长在一月八日致电联合国大会主席罗慕洛，联合国秘书长赖伊，并转安全理事会会员国苏联，美国，法国，英国，厄瓜多尔，印度，古巴，埃及，挪威政府，声明中国国民党反动残余集团的代表留在联合国安全理事会是非法的，并主张将他们从安理会中开除出去。我们中华人民共和国各民主党派谨联合严正宣告世界，我们认定周外交部长这样的词严义正的电报确实代表了中国全体人民的公意，我们一致的坚决的拥护周部长的主张。
    一九四九年十一月十五日周外交部长曾经分电联合国主席罗慕洛和联合国秘书长赖伊，正式否认当时出席大会的所谓“中国国民政府”派遣的蒋廷黻所领导的代表团的合法地位，声明他们不能代表中国，并要求联合国“根据联合国宪章的原则与精神”立即取消蒋廷黻等的代表团资格及其参加会议的一切权利，以符合中国人民的愿望；我们的友邦苏联波兰等国的代表团在联合国中曾根据周部长这一声明，一再唤起大会注意这个问题，苏联代表团并提案否认所谓“中国国民政府”代表地位。不幸，这些正义的要求，竟为美帝国主义集团阻挠未能实现，殊令我们中国人民对这样的联合国大为失望。
    现在参加联合国安全理事会的蒋廷黻代表团早已失去了代表中国的资格，它所代表的中国国民党反动集团的所谓“中国国民政府”伪政权，早已土崩瓦解，蒋匪介石李匪宗仁辈，亦已成为流寇和亡命之徒，这个伪政权实际上已不复存在，是举世皆知的事实。如此死亡净尽的伪政权，却还在联合国及其安全理事会中保留一个鬼影，在那里排演傀儡丑剧，甚至担任安全理事会的主席，这不但是国际政治史上一个空前的极大的滑稽，而且是对联合国的极大污辱，对于我们中国人民更是一个极大的污辱，此而可忍，孰不可忍！
    因此，我们要求联合国安全理事会各会员国，尊重我们中国人民的公意，接受我国周外长的建议，立即将蒋廷黻的所谓代表团驱逐出会。我们同时愿严正警告美帝国主义者集团，倘若他们依然玩弄联合国，豢养并支持蒋廷黻之流的鬼影代表团在联合国中排演傀儡丑剧，这是中国人民所不能忍受的，其一切后果应由美帝负完全责任。谨此公告。
