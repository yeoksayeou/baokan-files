Jiangxi's Unlawful Landlords
Conspire to Delay Grain Delivery
Will be Punished by the Government
[This Newspaper's Report] During the autumn grain collection in some areas of Jiangxi, many instances of landlords delaying grain delivery were discovered. The People's Government is taking effective measures to punish them. Landlords generally employed the following methods to delay grain delivery: (1) Dispersing and hiding grain. When the broad masses of peasants actively organized to deliver grain, the landlords dispersed and hid large quantities of grain. For example, Yang Guobao, a landlord in Zaobei Village, Wanshe Township, Sixth District, Nanchang County, hid more than 100 dan of rice in the corner of his courtyard. Deng Bida, a landlord in Jiangqiao Township, First District, Xinjian, hid 80 dan of rice in a secret storage. Some landlords dispersed grain among relatives and friends and then pretended to be suffering, requesting a reduction in their burden. (2) Spreading rumors to deceive the masses. When the peasants of Chongwen Township, Third District, Gaoan, were enthusiastically delivering grain, the landlords spread rumors saying, "Don't deliver anymore, 100 jin of public grain is equivalent to 1 shi (the original regulation was 108 jin per shi), now it's enough." (3) Buying off cadres. Zeng Wenji, a landlord in Daibei Village, First District, Le'an County, invited Li Bing-san, a peasant representative of the village, for drinks, asking him to reduce his burden by 2,000 jin. (4) Making excuses. Shen Zhengfa, a landlord in Dongyang Township, Pingxiang County, said, "I have the grain, but I haven't hired porters." (5) Tying up representatives, resisting delivery with guns. Ye Wanliang and other local bullies and landlords in Xiaojia Ferry Village, First District, Jinxi County, used hooligans to tie up Lu Shunliang, the peasant representative of the village, and beat him up. Landlords in Guanshang Village, Xinyu County, organized a "Unity Association," resisted grain delivery with guns, and instigated their henchmen to beat peasant representative Zhong Meikuang. Others also colluded with a few backward masses to petition the government in order to achieve their goal of delaying grain delivery. In order to ensure that public grain was stored on time, peasants in various areas actively launched struggles against unlawful landlords who delayed grain delivery. More than 10,000 people in the Fourth District of Nanchang County held a meeting to fight against Huang Wenxiang, a local bully who resisted grain delivery and tied up agricultural association cadres, and handed him over to the government for punishment according to the law. Xie Zhaoxiu and Wu Xianying, directors of the Women's Association of Sancun Village, Gangxia Township, Fourth District, Chongren, discovered more than 1,800 jin of grain hidden by the landlord Fang Zhigang, thwarting his conspiracy to delay delivery. Currently, the People's Governments in various areas are organizing the masses to deliver grain while resolutely punishing the small number of unlawful elements who delay delivery according to the law.

    江西不法地主
    阴谋拖交公粮
    将受政府惩处
    【本报讯】江西若干地区在秋征中曾发现不少地主拖交公粮现象，人民政府正采取有效措施予以惩处。地主拖交公粮，一般是采用了下列几种方法：（一）分散隐藏粮食。当广大农民积极组织起来送缴时，地主便将大批粮食进行分散隐藏。如南昌县六区万舍乡枣北村地主杨国保，将一百多担谷子藏在院角里。新建一区江桥乡地主邓必达将八十担谷子藏在暗仓里。有的地主将粮食分散于亲友家后，即假装叫苦，要求减轻负担。（二）制造谣言，欺骗群众。高安三区崇文乡农民送粮正起劲时，地主散放谣言说：“不要再送了，公粮是一百斤抵一石（原规定是一百零八斤抵一石），现在够了。”（三）收买干部。乐安县一区带陂村地主曾文集，请该村农民代表李丙三喝酒，要他减去负担二千斤。（四）找借口。萍乡县东阳乡地主沈正发说：“粮是有，就是没雇上挑夫。”（五）捆打代表，持枪抗缴。金溪县一区萧家渡村恶霸地主叶万良等，利用流氓把该村农民代表卢顺良捆打一顿。新喻县贯上村地主组织了“统一会”，持枪抗缴公粮，并唆使狗腿们打农民代表钟美况。其他还有拉拢少数落后群众，到政府去请愿，以达到自己拖缴公粮的目的。各地农民为保证公粮按期入仓，向拖交公粮的不法地主积极展开了斗争。南昌县四区万余群众集会向抗缴公粮，捆打农会干部的恶霸黄文祥开展斗争，并交政府依法惩办。崇仁四区港下乡三村妇女协会主任谢招秀、吴贤英等，查出地主方志刚隐藏的粮食一千八百多斤，使地主拖交阴谋落空。现各地人民政府一面组织群众送粮，一面对拖延不缴的少数不法分子，坚决依法惩办。
