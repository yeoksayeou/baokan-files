Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 6th: The CPC branch of Dongzhang Village, Nangong County, Hebei Province, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to extend New Year greetings and report on the production achievements of the past year. The full text of the original letter is as follows:

Respected Leader Chairman Mao:

Because of your wise leadership, we have all been emancipated and have land to cultivate. Last winter, our village thoroughly completed land reform. Every farmer in the village was allocated three mu of land and two houses, and from then on, they all had the means for living and production.

This spring, your call for "an inch of increase in production" reached the village, which coincided with everyone's desire to become rich. Therefore, the whole village enthusiastically responded to your call and worked hard to apply more fertilizer, cultivate carefully, and pay attention to improving production techniques, thus achieving great results. The general crop yields reached pre-war levels, and cotton production even exceeded pre-war levels. In order to supply the factories in the cities and meet the needs of building a new industrialized China, the county assigned our village the task of planting 1,136 mu of cotton and also put forward the specific requirement of increasing the yield by ten jin of cotton per mu. We first established a village production committee and absorbed Du Cunhe, Meng Xianchen, Meng Xinghua, and others who had the most experience and the highest techniques in cotton planting as members to guide the improvement of cotton planting methods.

		Cadres and Party members took the lead in planting; skilled workers guided the improvement of technology

After deeply publicizing the benefits of cotton planting, everyone's enthusiasm for cotton planting was very high. Cadres and Party members took the lead in planting, coupled with the guidance of skilled cotton planters. Two hundred and four households in the village planted 1,261 mu of cotton, accounting for 45 percent of the village's cultivated land, exceeding the task by 125 mu, and 380 mu more than last year. Due to the widespread adoption of improved sowing methods, using single-legged plows to create large ridges, the seedlings emerged completely despite the dry spring. Everyone changed the past habit of applying little fertilizer to cotton and applied extra fertilizer. Comrade Hou Guilai planted cotton on all eleven mu of stubble land, applying twenty carts of manure and one thousand jin of soybean cake. Meng Runting, Meng Jinshan, and others applied 120 jin of fine fertilizer per mu.

During the cotton's growth in the summer, skilled cotton planters guided everyone to carry out multiple cultivations, pruning, topping, and processing. The cotton plants grew very strong, with extended branches and abundant cotton bolls. Meng Rongpo, a 62-year-old farmer, did not rest once during the entire summer, hoeing, weeding, and tidying the cotton fields all day long. Party member Hou Guilai often forgot to eat because of tending to the cotton; Party members Meng Qingxin, Hou Wenbao, and more than thirty others cultivated and tended their cotton four to five times.

		Average yield of 140 jin per mu; highest yield reaches 285 jin; cotton quality meets medium-grade standards

In the autumn, we summarized the cotton harvest. The highest yields were from Meng Xinghua, Hou Guilai, and more than forty other households, with over 390 mu yielding 180 to 285 jin per mu. Meng Xinghua's three mu yielded more than 850 jin. Hou Guilai's eleven mu yielded more than 2,440 jin. Deng Tonghai's four mu yielded 860 jin. The general households averaged 120 to 150 jin per mu. In total, the village produced more than 176,500 jin of seed cotton, with an average yield of about 140 jin per mu, an increase of about 50 jin per mu compared to last year, exceeding the highest pre-war yield of 20 to 30 jin per mu; in particular, the cotton quality all met the standards of medium-grade cotton.

The masses in the whole village celebrated the unprecedented bumper harvest of cotton, and were even more grateful for your leadership. They all expressed that they would resolutely follow you forever and live a happy and free life.

During the autumn grain requisition this year, the county requisitioned 50,000 jin of seed cotton from our village. Party members in our village took the lead in paying, and the whole village actively volunteered, successfully completing the task in less than five days, delivering the cotton to the station for storage, and even over-delivering 1,062 jin. The government converted the price of seed cotton into millet at a rate of 3.7 jin of millet per jin of seed cotton. After deducting this year's public grain owed by the whole village, 117,070 jin of millet were returned, averaging 600 jin of rice per household.

		Government guarantees cotton prices; everyone is enthusiastic about planting cotton; more planting is planned this year; guaranteed increase in production again

With the good cotton harvest and the government's guarantee of cotton prices, everyone's enthusiasm for planting cotton is even higher next year. The family of military dependent Dong Wenlan received back 1,200 jin of millet because of over-delivering cotton, enough for the family's food for two years. She plans to plant all 21 mu of land with cotton next year. There are many such families in our village. Everyone especially wants to buy more fertilizer. Now our village has bought more than 120,000 jin of soybean cake. We strive to plant cotton on 70 percent of the village's cultivated land next year, applying an average of 100 jin of fine fertilizer per mu. On the basis of this year's production, we will increase the yield by another 10 to 15 jin per mu next year.

This is hereby reported as a New Year's gift for 1950.

Respectfully wishing you good health.

CPC Branch of Dongzhang Village, Nangong County, Hebei Province

    南宫东张家庄中共支部给毛主席写信贺年
    报告棉花空前丰收
    【新华社保定六日电】新年前夕，河北省南宫县东张家庄中共支部给毛主席写信贺年，报告一年的生产成绩。原信全文如下：敬爱的领袖毛主席：
    因为你的英明领导，我们都翻身了，都有了地种了。去年冬季我村彻底完成了土地改革，全村的农民每人都填补到三亩地和两间房屋，从此都有了生活和生产资料了。
    今春，你的“生产长一寸”的号召传达到村里，正合大家发家致富的要求。因此全村都热烈响应了你的号召，作到了多施肥、精耕细作，还注意了提高生产技术，因此得到很大成绩。一般的庄稼收成达到了战前的产量，棉花产量还超过了战前。为了供给城市的工厂，供给建设工业化新中国的需要，县上分配给俺村种棉一千一百三十六亩的任务，还提出了每亩增产十斤棉花的具体要求。我们首先建立了村生产委员会，将种棉最有经验、技术最高的杜存和、孟宪辰、孟兴华等都吸收为委员，指导改进种棉的方法。
            干部党员带头多种  能手指导改进技术
    经过深入地宣传种棉的好处，大家种棉的情绪都非常高涨。干部党员带头多种，又加上种棉能手的指导，全村二百零四户，种棉一千二百六十一亩，占全村耕地的百分之四十五，超过任务一百二十五亩，比去年多种三百八十亩。由于普遍接受了改进播种方法，独脚耠耩耧大垅，所以春天地虽干燥，苗却都出的很齐全。大家改变了过去种棉少施肥的习惯，格外多施了肥。党员侯贵来同志十一亩茬地都种的棉花，上粪二十车，又施豆饼一千斤。孟润亭、孟晋三等每亩都施到细肥一百二十斤。
    夏季棉花发育的时候，种棉能手指导大家普遍进行了多次的中耕、整枝、打卡、加工，棉棵都发长得非常壮，棵枝伸展，棉桃累累。六十二岁的农民孟荣坡，整夏季不曾歇过一次晌，整天价在棉地里锄，耘，打整。党员侯贵来，时常因整棉忘掉吃饭；党员孟庆信、侯文报，还有三十多个人，都把他们的棉花中耕和打整了四遍到五遍。
    每亩平均产量百四十斤  最高者达二百八十五斤  棉花质量都合中级标准
    秋后，我们总结了棉花的收成。产量最高的是孟兴华、侯贵来等四十多户，三百九十多亩，每亩合一百八十斤到二百八十五斤。孟兴华的三亩收了八百五十多斤。侯贵来的十一亩收了二千四百四十多斤。邓通海的四亩收了八百六十斤。一般的户，每亩都合到一百二十斤到一百五十斤。总计全村共产籽棉十七万六千五百多斤，每亩平均产量一百四十斤左右，比去年每亩平均增产约五十斤，超过了战前每亩最高产量二、三十斤；特别是棉花质量都合中级棉的标准。
    全村群众都欢庆棉花空前的丰收，更加感激你领导的大恩，都表示坚决地永远跟着你走，过幸福自由的日子。
    今年秋征，县里向我村征购五万斤籽棉。我村党员首先带头缴，全村都踊跃自报，不到五天就顺利完成，送站入仓，还多交了一千零六十二斤。政府按每斤籽棉折三斤七两小米的价格折成了小米，除抵交了今年全村应交的公粮，又找回了十一万七千零七十斤小米，每户平均找回六百斤米。
    政府保证棉价  大家种棉情绪好  今年还要多种  保证产量再提高
    棉花收成既好，政府又保证了棉价，因此大家明年种棉的情绪更高了。军属董文兰家，因为多交棉找回了一千二百斤小米，够全家二年的食粮，她计划把二十一亩地明年全部种棉。像这样的家户，我村还有不少。大家特别都要更多买肥，现在我村已买到豆饼十二万多斤。我们争取明年种棉种到全村耕地的百分之七十，施肥到每亩平均一百斤细肥。在今年的基础上，明年每亩再增产十斤到十五斤。
    谨此报告，当作一九五○年的新年献礼。
    敬祝你的身体健康
                               河北省南宫县东张家庄村支部
