Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 25th. The Political Department of the Shandong Military Region of the People's Liberation Army held a Youth Work Conference on December 22nd of last year to inspect the regiment-building work in the Shandong Military Region's troops. Youth work cadres from fourteen units, including three-level military regions, a certain army, garrison troops, Changwei, Zibo Special Zone, and directly subordinate units, participated in this conference. At the meeting, each unit reported on the status and experience of their regiment-building work. From the beginning of September last year, when Shandong troops began key experimental regiment-building, until the time of the meeting, 218 units had established Communist Youth League organizations, developing 3,925 members and training more than 370 youth work cadres. In all units where the Communist Youth League had been established, the members played an active role in aspects such as training, mutual assistance, consolidating the troops, cultural learning, and enlivening troop life. In the 7th Company of the 285th Regiment of a certain army, 36 league members achieved 106 ring hits out of 108 shots during shooting exercises. When the squad leader of the 4th Squad of the 4th Company of the 281st Regiment was transferred to the division headquarters for training, the remaining three league members assisted the deputy squad leader in doing a good job in the squad's work, and the squad won the Red Flag Outstanding Squad award. In terms of enlivening troop life, two-thirds of the performers participating in evening performances in various units were league members, who were very popular with the masses.

Before starting regiment-building, there were various incorrect views on regiment-building work in the Shandong troops. For example, some cadres believed that regiment-building was "one more organization, one more trouble," and some Communist Party members believed that regiment-building "is none of our business." In response to this ideological situation, the significance of regiment-building was first explained to the cadres, and then propagated to the vast number of soldiers through the cadres. For party members, it was emphasized that party members have the responsibility to help with regiment-building, and then they were used to develop league members outside the party, and the Party Committee's leadership over the League was strengthened. Political, propaganda, and education cadres from companies and battalions were transferred and trained in stages to cultivate the backbone of regiment-building, and the method of typical experiments and gradual advancement was adopted to carry out regiment-building in conjunction with the tasks of the troops. However, there are still some problems in the regiment-building work of the Shandong troops. The development of the League is unbalanced. Half of the units in the Jiaodong area and two-fifths of the units in a certain army have established League organizations, but in areas such as Luzhongnan and Zibo, some are still focusing on regiment-building, and some have not yet started. In units where the League has already been established, some leading organs are too cautious and prudent, developing league members secretly, or setting the conditions too high and the procedures too complicated, resulting in very slow development of league members. For example, the Shandong Military and Political Cadre School only developed 20 league members in three months. Some Party committees and political leading organs have not paid enough attention to regiment-building work, which has also affected the progress of the work. These shortcomings were discussed and corrected at the meeting.

    山东军区举行青年工作会议
    检查部队建团工作
    重点实验性建团已获成绩，要求发展趋于平衡。
    【新华社济南二十五日电】人民解放军山东军区政治部为检查山东军区的部队建团工作，于去年十二月二十二日举行青年工作会议，参加这次会议的有三级军区、某军、警备部队、昌潍、淄博特区及直属队等十四个单位的青年工作干部。会议由各单位报告建团工作情况和经验。山东部队从去年九月初开始重点实验性的建团至开会时止，已经有二百十八个单位建立了青年团的组织，发展团员三千九百二十五人，培养了青年工作干部三百七十多人。凡是已经建立了青年团的部队，在练兵、互助、巩固部队、文化学习和活跃部队生活各方面，团员都起了积极作用。某军二八五团七连内三十六名团员演习射击时，一百零八发中有一百零六发中环。二八一团四连四班在班长调到师部受训时，其余三名团员就协助副班长搞好班内的工作，并且使该班获得了红旗优胜班的奖旗。在活跃部队生活方面，各部队参加晚会演出的三分之二是团员，都很受群众欢迎。
    山东部队在开始建团之前，部队中曾存在着对建团工作的各种不正确的看法，如有些干部认为建团是“多一重组织多一重麻烦”，有些共产党员认为建团“不关咱的事”。针对这种思想情况，首先在干部中解释建团的意义，然后通过干部向广大战士宣传，对于党员则强调党员有责任帮助建团，然后通过他们向党外发展团员，并加强党委对团的领导。抽调连、营政治、宣传、教育干部，分期训练，培养了建团的骨干，并采取典型试验和逐步推进的方式，结合部队的工作任务来进行建团工作。但山东部队的建团工作，目前还存在着一些问题，团的发展不平衡，胶东区已有一半的单位、某军有五分之二的单位都建立了团的组织，但在鲁中南、淄博等区则有的还在重点建团，有的还没有开始。已经建团的单位，有的领导机关过于谨慎稳重，秘密发展团员，或者把条件提得太高，手续繁琐，结果团员发展很慢，如山东军政干部学校在三个月内只发展了二十名团员。有些党委和政治领导机关还未足够地重视建团工作，也影响了工作的推进。会议对这些缺点都曾提出讨论并加以纠正。
