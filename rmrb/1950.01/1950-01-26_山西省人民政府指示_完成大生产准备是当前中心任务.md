Instructions from the Shanxi Provincial People's Government:
Completing Preparations for Large-Scale Production is the Current Central Task

[This newspaper reports] To complete the preparatory work for this year's large-scale production movement, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government issued instructions on the 15th of this month. The instructions pointed out that the province-wide winter production has been universally launched and has achieved significant results. Especially in fertilizer accumulation and fuel accumulation for spring plowing preparations, both the old areas and most of the new areas have exceeded previous years. Now that the New Year has passed and the Spring Festival is approaching, the central task should immediately be to complete the preparations for this year's large-scale production movement. Based on the current development in various regions, the following tasks should continue to be implemented:

	I. The fertilizer accumulation movement should continue to deepen, universally mobilizing semi- and auxiliary labor forces to diligently line pens, collect wild manure, sweep road soil, collect ash manure, and combine with oil pressing to accumulate oil cake, and combine with pig and sheep raising to increase fertilizer sources, further expand and consolidate fertilizer accumulation results, and pay attention to improving fertilizer storage management to increase fertilizer effectiveness.

	II. Universally mobilize the masses to repair and manufacture agricultural tools, absorb the experience of Wuxiang and other places, emphasize ideological mobilization, overcome the masses' accommodating thoughts such as "not preparing for half a year when you have money" and "use it three times even if it's rotten," clearly propose "borrowing and repaying" and "damage compensation," protect the ownership of agricultural tools based on "the owner's convenience," to resolve the masses' concerns about "one household preparing, a hundred households using in disorder," establish a long-term perspective, and promote mutual assistance in purchasing together. Develop the iron stove industry, support agricultural tool iron and wood factories, and solve their difficulties in raw materials and capital. Organize the transportation and sales of agricultural tools through cooperative organizations. Cooperatives in areas with a foundation can also handle agricultural tool loans in kind. It is essential to ensure that there are enough large and small agricultural tools for the old areas, enough small agricultural tools for the new areas, and supplementary large agricultural tools.

	III. Protect existing livestock, improve feeding management, cultivate livestock strength, and organize livestock to participate in transportation and other production, so as to "use livestock to raise livestock" and "use livestock to raise people." Select and increase the purchase of breeding livestock, and strengthen breeding guidance. In addition, pay attention to veterinary and epidemic prevention work to prevent spring plagues.

	IV. Pay attention to the production preparation work of revolutionary martyrs' families. Revolutionary martyrs' families' land accounts for about 20 percent of the total land in the old areas. Neglecting this work will have a great impact on consolidating national defense forces and this year's production increase movement.

	V. Vigorously promote thrift and prevent spring famine. Actively carry out production-based disaster relief work in disaster areas. In general areas, educate the masses to "make careful plans and practice strict economy" so that winter production income becomes a strong capital for this year's large-scale production.

	VI. Continue to implement and complete winter irrigation, actively prepare for opening canals and digging wells, repair old wells and old waterwheels, organize and consolidate water conservancy institutions, and study and improve unreasonable water regulations, to make all preparations for developing paddy fields in the spring.

	VII. Conduct a thorough inspection of the issuance and use of winter loans. Any that have not been issued or used improperly should be corrected. Investigate the difficulties of the masses in agricultural tools and breeding livestock, and prepare for the issuance of spring loans.

	VIII. Strengthen production guidance in new and backward areas, and overcome imbalances. Strengthen investigation and research, and make a good plan for this year's large-scale production based on the actual situation. Strive for the old areas to reach the pre-war production level, and the new areas to reach 85 percent of the pre-war production level. In terms of methods, a thorough inspection and discussion should be conducted through all levels and all sectors' representative meetings, giving full play to the strength and wisdom of the entire people, and overcoming the work style of coercion and commandism and formalism, to ensure the thorough realization of the above tasks.

    山西省人民政府指示
    完成大生产准备是当前中心任务
    【本报讯】为完成今年大生产运动准备工作，本月十五日山西省人民政府发出指示，指示中指出：目前全省冬季生产已经普遍展开，并已获得显著成绩，特别在积肥，积燃等春耕准备上，老区与大部新区均超过往年。刻下新年已过，春节迫近，应立即以完成今年大生产运动的准备为当前的中心任务。从目前各地发展情况看，继续贯彻以下几项工作：
    一、积肥运动仍应继续深入，普遍发动半、辅劳力，勤垫圈、拾野粪、扫道土、溜灰粪，与榨油相结合积蓄油饼，与养猪养羊相结合增加肥源，进一步扩大与巩固积肥成果，并注意改善肥料储藏管理，增加肥效。
    二、普遍地发动群众修置农具，吸收武乡等地经验，重视思想发动，克服群众“有钱不置半年闲”及“烂不烂使三遍”等迁就思想，明确提出“有借有还”“损坏赔偿”，保护“物由主便”的农具所有权，以解决群众的“一户置备、百户乱用”的顾虑，树立长期观点，提倡互助伙购。开展铁炉业，扶植农具铁木工厂，解决其原料与资本的困难。通过合作组织农具运销，合作社有基础地区并可办理农具贷实，必需保证老区大小农具均够用，新区小农具够用，大农具得到补充。
    三、保护现有牲畜，改善饲养管理，培养牲畜体力，组织牲畜参加运输等生产，做到“以牲畜养牲畜”“以牲畜养人”。选择与增购种畜，加强繁殖指导。此外并注意兽医与防疫工作，以预防春瘟。
    四、重视烈军属的生产准备工作。烈军属土地在老区约占土地总数百分之二十，忽略这一工作，对巩固国防军及今年的增产运动均有很大影响。
    五、大力提倡节约，防止春荒，在灾区积极进行生产救灾工作，在一般地区教育群众“细水长流、节约储蓄”，使冬季生产所得成为今年大生产的有力资本。
    六、继续贯彻与完成冬浇，积极准备开渠打井，修理旧井旧水车，整理整顿水利机构，研究改进不合理的水规，为开春发展水田做好一切准备工作。
    七、确实检查冬贷发放及其使用情况，未发放或使用不适当者，应予纠正。并调查群众农具、种畜困难情况，准备春贷发放工作。
    八、加强新区与落后区生产指导，克服不平衡现象。并应加强调查研究，依据实际情况，做好今年大生产计划。争取老区达到战前生产水平，新区达到战前生产水平百分之八十五。在方式上应通过各级各界代表会议，充分检查讨论，发挥全体人民的力量与智慧，克服强迫命令与形式主义作风，以保证上述任务的彻底实现。
