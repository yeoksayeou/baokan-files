    Northeast Region's Health Construction Achieves Great Successes This Past Year
    Supplied 25,000 Cadres to the Fourth Field Army Established 200 Industrial and Mining Health Units
    Cultivated Thousands of New-Type Medical Personnel Who Became the Backbone of Various Health Works
    This Year's Health Work Plan:
    Establish Complete Industrial and Mining Health Work and Early Prevention of Plague, Universally Build Grassroots Health Institutions

    [This Newspaper's Report] In the past year, the Northeast region's health work has achieved significant accomplishments. In terms of supporting the war effort, it equipped the entire health staff (25,081 people) and medical equipment of the Fourth Field Army. The total value of medicines and equipment supplied throughout the year was 567,627,876,200 Northeast currency. In terms of industrial and mining health: it equipped all industrial and mining health organizations, established 223 health units (including 17 hospitals and 206 health stations), and dispatched public health experts to conduct in-depth investigations into industrial and mining health conditions. In August, it also convened a conference on industrial and mining health to study the improvement of industrial and mining safety equipment and the prevention of occupational diseases and infectious diseases. In the prevention and control of infectious diseases, the first achievement was overcoming the threat of plague. A total of 14,590,000 rats were caught throughout the year (requiring 73 train carriages to transport them, saving the people of Northeast China from the consumption of 269,915 tons of food by rats). The number of plague cases decreased by 91.9% compared to 1948, ensuring the lives and property of the people in the epidemic area (700 kilometers long and 500 kilometers wide). The construction of a plague prevention and control center has recently begun. In the prevention and control of other infectious diseases, a complete tuberculosis prevention and control center has been established. The large-scale manufacturing by the Changchun Health Technology Factory and the Dalian Health Research Institute has ensured the supply of all the infectious disease prevention vaccines and serums needed in the region. In terms of general health construction, eight sanatoriums have been opened to facilitate the recuperation of technical experts, workers, and the National Defense Army. In terms of training medical personnel, three medical universities have been established, graduating more than 2,000 people throughout the year. These new-type health workers have become the backbone of establishing industrial and mining health, military health, and rural health. A veterinary school has also been established in Changchun to ensure the prevention and treatment of diseases in military horses in the future. In order to popularize and improve modern scientific medical knowledge, more than 110,000 copies of books related to medicine and health have been published throughout the year, and over 280,000 copies of the Health Bulletin have been distributed. In just one year, the Northeast health authorities, after the serious destruction by the Kuomintang bandit gang, quickly overcame various difficulties and achieved brilliant results, laying a solid foundation for the work in 1950. The plan for the Northeast health work in 1950 is to: universally carry out health publicity and education work in factories, mines, rural areas, troops, schools, and government agencies; strengthen industrial and mining health institutions and equipment and establish a complete set of industrial and mining health work, and do a good job in the health work of the four directly-administered cities of Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, and Benxi; strengthen the health work of the Northeast National Defense Army; mobilize the masses to catch 20 million rats, and inject vaccines early to prevent the plague from recurring, and even if it occurs, it will not become a disaster; at the same time, establish health institutions in the epidemic area to correct bad hygiene habits, with one health assistant in each district, one health committee member in each village, and one health team leader in every ten households, and establish a health duty system, with every ten households taking turns on duty to check the health covenants; the prevention and control of tuberculosis will also be a key experiment this year, preparing for promotion next year; in order to implement the Northeast People's Government's policy on the promotion of health and medical undertakings, it is decided to set up a health experimental county in each province to absorb experience; at the same time, promote the public-private partnership of district and county health cooperatives; in addition, continued investment will be made in the Northeast Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, hoping to solve 70% of the medicines needed in the Northeast this year, and to reduce costs and improve production standards.
