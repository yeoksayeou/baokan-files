    "New China Women" Issue No. 7 Published
    Discussion on Women's Participation in Winter Studies
    [Our Newspaper] "New China Women," Issue No. 7, has been published. The content of this issue focuses on winter studies. The editorial "Quickly Run Winter Studies Well" points out that currently running winter studies well is one of the important contents of current women's work, and every woman worker must attach importance to this work and find ways to do it well. "The Women's Winter School in Liujiacheng" illustrates that when organizing the broad masses of rural women to carry out winter study education, the educational content must meet their urgent needs and must not be simply political and cultural (knowing a few more characters) education. Without this, there will be no good results. "Beijing's 8th District Women's Literacy Class" provides some practical materials worth referencing for running urban women's literacy classes, pointing out what issues should be paid attention to when carrying out this work. "How the New District Mobilizes Women to Participate in Production" explains that if you want to organize and mobilize women to participate in agricultural labor, you must first promote the truth of "labor is glorious, production makes a family prosperous" to them, breaking the old, feudal, so-called erroneous thinking of "marry a man, marry a man, get clothes and food," and then organize them in a planned and step-by-step manner. The valuable experience of "The Educational Work of the Beijing Women's Production and Education Institute" is something that women workers in major cities across the country need to learn. "Our Work Has Penetrated the Factory" introduces the experience of the Beijing National No. 1 Midwifery College in carrying out health work in factories: no matter what kind of work is carried out in the factory, it is necessary to closely contact the factory, the trade union, and the women's federation to seek their assistance. In addition to this, there are also nine local work communications, seven mass compositions, two ideological reform articles from intellectuals, film reviews, Kang Zhuo's novel "Living Shadow," and articles such as lessons twenty-five, six, seven, and eight of the Common Knowledge Textbook for Workers and Peasants.

    讨论妇女参加冬学问题
    【本报讯】《新中国妇女》第七期已出版。本期内容以冬学为重点。在“赶快办好冬学”的社论里指出：目前办好冬学，是当前妇女工作的重要内容之一，每个妇女工作者，必须重视此工作，而且要想办法做好。“刘家城的妇女冬学”，说明了在组织广大农村妇女群众进行冬学教育的时候，教育内容一定要适合她们的迫切要求，绝不是单纯地去进行政治、文化（多识几个字）教育。不如此，就没有好效果。“北京市八区妇女识字班”，提供了一些办城市妇女识字班值得参考的实际材料，指出在进行此工作时应注意些什么样的问题。“新区怎样发动妇女参加生产的”，说明了要想把妇女组织与发动起来，参加农业劳动，则必须首先向她们宣传“劳动光荣，生产发家”的真理，打破旧的、封建的所谓“嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭”的错误思想，然后再有计划有步骤地去把她们组织起来。“北京市妇女生产教养院的教育工作”的宝贵经验，是全国各大城市妇女工作者需要学习的。“我们的工作深入了工厂”，介绍了北京市国立第一助产学院到工厂去进行卫生工作的经验：到工厂去不论进行什么样的工作，一定要与厂方、工会、妇联密切联系，求得他们协助。除此而外，还有各地工作通讯九篇、大众习作七篇、知识分子的思想改造两篇、影评、康濯的小说《活影子》及工农妇女常识课本二十五、六、七、八课等文章。
