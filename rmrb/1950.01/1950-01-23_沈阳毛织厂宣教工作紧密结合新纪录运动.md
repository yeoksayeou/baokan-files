    The Shenyang Woolen Mill's Propaganda and Education Work Closely Integrates with the New Record Movement
    [Our Newspaper News] The Shenyang Woolen Mill achieved considerable success in the New Record Movement, largely due to the significant role played by propaganda and education work. At the outset of the movement, factory leaders first mobilized the entire workforce at a factory-wide meeting and distributed accessible reference materials on the New Record Movement for workers to study. Subsequently, they organized group discussions on three questions: "What is a new record?", "Can our factory create new records?", and "How can we create new records?". Following these preparatory efforts, the New Record Movement quickly unfolded in the factory.
    After the movement began, a Roll of Honor and a blackboard newspaper were established. Workers who set new records in each workshop were immediately registered on the Roll of Honor, and the news was disseminated throughout the factory via the blackboard newspaper. As a result, all factory workers were motivated to strive for inclusion on the Roll of Honor, sparking a production competition. In the dyeing and finishing shop, female workers in the picking group could only pick five pieces of wool cloth per day during the puppet Manchukuo period. After the competition started, in order to be on the Roll of Honor, the output of average workers increased from five to about ten pieces, and the highest output reached fifteen pieces.
    During the movement, close attention was paid to the workers' ideological trends. It was discovered that workers were afraid of quotas and unemployment, some were worried that wage increases wouldn't be given for increased production, or that they would lose face if they couldn't set new records. The trade union and administrative leaders, on one hand, explained things to the workers, and on the other hand, resolved practical problems to dispel the workers' ideological concerns. For example, before the New Record Movement, workers in the weaving department each watched one weaving machine. After the movement started, some people could watch two machines. The administration immediately increased the wages of workers watching two weaving machines, and subsequently, thirteen workers in the weaving department were able to watch two weaving machines.
    When problems could not be solved, methods were learned from newspapers. Workers in the carpentry group of the repair department felt that the carpentry group's work was fragmented and there was no way to create new records. After seeing the experience of other factory carpentry groups creating new records in the Worker's Daily, the movement also unfolded in this group. Wang Qingyun set a new record of making four two-foot-high square stools in one hour and thirty minutes (normally it takes nine hours). Other workers in the group also successively set new records.

    沈阳毛织厂宣教工作紧密结合新纪录运动
    【本报讯】沈阳毛织厂在新纪录运动中之所以获得不小成绩，宣传教育工作起了很大作用。运动开始，工厂领导上首先在全厂职工会议上进行动员，并印发新纪录运动通俗的参考文件，供给职工学习。随即组织各小组讨论“什么是新纪录”，“本厂能否创造新纪录”，“我们怎样创造新纪录”等三个问题。经过以上的准备工作，新纪录运动在该厂很快的展开了。
    运动展开以后，设立光荣簿、黑板报。每天各工作间创造新纪录的工人，立刻登记到光荣簿上，由黑板报将消息传播全厂。这样一来，全厂工人都为争取上光荣簿而掀起生产竞赛。染整场摘呢组女工，在伪满时期两个人一天只能摘五匹呢，竞赛开始后，为了上光荣簿，产量一般的已由五匹增加到十匹左右，最高的能摘十五匹。
    运动中，随时注意工人思想动态，发现工人怕定员、怕失业，有的怕做多了工资不给提高，或怕创造不出新纪录丢人。工会和行政领导上，一方面向工人进行解释，同时以解决实际问题来打破工人的思想顾虑。如机织部工人，新纪录运动前，一人看一台织呢机，运动开始后，有的人能看两台，行政上马上给看两台织呢机的工人增加了工资，于是机织部接连出现了十三位能看两台织呢机的工人。
    当问题没法解决时，即从报纸上学办法。该厂修制部木工组工人，感到木工组活零碎，没有办法创造新纪录。从工人报上看到其他厂木工组创造新纪录的经验以后，运动在这一小组里也展开了，出现了王庆云一点三十分钟做四个二尺高方凳子的新纪录（平时需要九小时）。该组其他工人，也都陆续创造了新纪录。
