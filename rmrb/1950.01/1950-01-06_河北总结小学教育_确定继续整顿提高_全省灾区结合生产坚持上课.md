Hebei Province's Education Department recently summarized the past year's primary education work. Based on the experience of the past year and the problems existing in the work, it formulated a work plan for the first half of this year to gradually solve the problem of enrollment for children from poor workers and peasants, improve the teaching staff, strengthen leadership, improve equipment, and solve textbook problems. Efforts will be made to achieve a 70 percent enrollment rate for school-age children within two to three years. Over the past year, primary education in Hebei Province has gradually developed and improved in the process of restoration and rectification, overcoming difficulties in the face of repeated disasters. In most areas, the number of schools and students has increased. According to statistics from ten counties and cities including Rongcheng and Ba County, after rectification, 2,367 new junior primary schools and 145 senior primary schools or complete primary schools were added; according to statistics from eight counties including Fangshan and Liangxiang, 100 new junior primary schools and complete primary schools were added in half a year, totaling 158 classes and 13,810 students. At present, the number of children enrolled in schools throughout the province has reached more than 2.3 million, accounting for approximately 50 percent of all school-age children. All localities have paid attention to the enrollment of children from poor workers and peasants. For example, in Tangshan and Baoding, the number of children from workers and poor urban residents increased by 443; in some schools in the old liberated areas, half-day classes, early morning, noon, and evening classes were adopted to facilitate the enrollment of farmers' children. The phenomena of indiscipline, lack of rules and regulations, and excessive and biased extracurricular activities that once occurred in primary schools in various places have been overcome; cultural learning has been strengthened, various work systems have been established, and learning effectiveness has been improved. The impression among the masses that "going to school cannot teach you to read" has begun to change, and they are now concerned about schools and actively support running schools. Many villages automatically build school buildings and add various teaching equipment. Some, on the ruins destroyed by the enemy, the masses and teachers and students of various schools jointly built schools; some, under the destruction of severe floods, combined production and disaster relief to restore schools. Under the conditions of financial difficulties, many achievements have been made in the past year. For example, primary schools in Ding County used various methods to add desks, wooden boards, adobe platforms, etc., solving the desk and substitute problems for more than 17,700 students; in the disaster area of Renqiu, 56 collapsed school buildings have been repaired, in the disaster area of En County, 28 primary schools have been restored, and in the disaster area of Anxin, one-third of primary schools have been restored.
