    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 3rd: The more than 10,000 remnant Kuomintang bandits under Wang Chunhui, entrenched in the triangular area of Jiahe, Linwu, and Lanshan in southern Hunan, have been completely wiped out after half a month of active suppression by a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. During the first stage of the PLA's suppression campaign, they swiftly attacked the bandit's lair, annihilating more than 10,000 bandits in the area of Maojun (about 20 miles east of Lanshan) and Jiangdong (about 30 miles south of Maojun). The bandit leader, Wang Chunhui, a KMT secret agent and "Director of the Southeast Office of the Military Police," then led over a thousand remnants in a breakout from the Lanshan area, fleeing north. The Second Battalion of a certain regiment of the PLA relentlessly pursued them for 450 li in five days and six nights, and, in coordination with the local armed forces of the Chenzhou and Hengyang sub-districts, completely annihilated all the remnant bandits attempting to escape east across the Yuehan Railway in the Taiping圩 and Banqiao areas of Leiyang County on the 15th. This included killing 39 bandits including Zhang Baochen, the Major General Deputy Director of the Southeast Office of the Military Police, capturing 1,518 bandit officers and soldiers, seizing 297 rifles and carbines, 20 pistols, 334 submachine guns, 265 carbines, 16 light machine guns, 7 heavy machine guns, 10 grenade launchers, 3 rocket launchers, 5 60mm mortars, 3 signal guns, 1 switchboard, 15 individual telephones, 4 radio stations, 15 horses, and 75,660 rounds of ammunition. The bandit leader Wang Chunhui was also seriously wounded. With this, all the bandits in southern Hunan have been wiped out, and the conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi bandit gangs to "develop guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines" in southern Hunan has gone bankrupt.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 2nd: The People's Liberation Army Zhejiang Military Region has eliminated more than 45,000 bandits in the past seven months. At present, bandits in 85% of Zhejiang Province have been basically wiped out. Only a very few areas still have bandit activities of over 100 people, plus scattered bandits, the province still has over 10,000 bandits. The people's armed forces in the province have greatly expanded. The Zhejiang Military Region Command announced the following anti-bandit battle results from May to November 1949:

    (A) A total of more than 45,100 bandits were eliminated, including more than 2,900 killed or wounded, more than 23,400 captured alive, and more than 18,700 who surrendered.
