Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 5th: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government has issued a statement, pointing out that all personnel of the former Kuomintang reactionary government's overseas embassies, consulates, and offices should be responsible for protecting assets and documents, awaiting takeover, and refraining from destruction or illegal sales. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Recently, reports have repeatedly indicated that a small number of extremely reactionary elements in the former Kuomintang reactionary government's overseas embassies and consulates have dared to steal and sell public property and destroy documents. I now solemnly declare that all overseas embassies and consulates of the former Kuomintang reactionary government, as well as offices and personnel dispatched to foreign countries by former Kuomintang reactionary organs, should continue to serve as before and be responsible for protecting all assets, charts, books, files, etc., pending inventory and takeover, until the Central People's Government sends personnel to take over. Those who have made meritorious contributions to protection will be given appropriate rewards by the Central People's Government; those who have made meritorious contributions to protection and are willing to continue to serve will be allowed to be employed according to their abilities after the Central People's Government takes over; those who dare to execute the false orders of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant regime, destroy documents, or steal and sell public property will be severely punished by the Central People's Government and will not be tolerated.

Personnel of the former Kuomintang reactionary government's overseas embassies and consulates, as well as offices and personnel dispatched to foreign countries by former Kuomintang reactionary organs, should all recognize the bright path of national liberation, establish a position of serving the people, accept the leadership of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and make contributions to atone for their mistakes and seek forgiveness from the people, which is of utmost importance.
