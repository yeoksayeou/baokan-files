[Beijing News] Workers at the Beijing Water Company have improved machines and repaired discarded tools, increasing production efficiency and overcoming the difficulty of tool shortages. The most difficult task in the Water Meter Division is making gear plates (i.e., gears). Previously, each person made seven per day, and they were often uneven in thickness, and some were unusable. Last November, craftsman Huo Junzeng created a "flat washer" from a one-inch long octagonal steel bar, eliminating the previous problems and increasing production to fourteen per day. However, this type of washer could only be used for Golden Gate meters. Later, craftsman Dai Jinyan further found a pattern for the card head, and at the end of last year, made one card head and five card mouths. As a result, not only could all kinds of gear plates be used, but production efficiency also increased by another tenth. Recently, the workers in this division also managed to repair ninety discarded meters that had been abandoned for decades, saving 4,900 catties of millet. The pipe wrenches used by the Water Supply Division are expensive and scarce. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient pipe wrench allocation, squad leader Fang Baoshu, and craftsmen Li Yuqi, Yao Rentang, and others, voluntarily tried to repair seven discarded pipe wrenches on the 5th of this month. After the experiment was successful, they found sixty-two more from the Dongzhimen Water Plant and twenty-nine from the scrap pile in the second warehouse, and are now repairing them. Repairing one wrench saves 195 catties of millet. Once all of these discarded items are repaired, they will be sufficient for three years of use.

    京自来水公司工人改造机器整修工具
    【北京讯】自来水公司工人，改进机器，整修废工具，提高了生产效率，克服了工具缺乏的困难。该公司水表股制造水表最难的一项工作是造牙盘（即齿轮），以前每人每天做七个，而且常常一边薄一边厚，也有的不适用，去年十一月工匠霍钧曾用一块一英寸长的八楞钢创造了“平面洗子”，免除了以前的毛病，使产量提高到每天十四个。但是这种洗子只能做金门表，后来工匠戴金延又进一步找出卡头的图样，在去年年底，做出卡头一份，卡嘴五个。结果，不只各种牙盘都可以用了，而且生产效率又提高了十分之一。最近该股工人还设法修好了废弃几十年的废表九十个，节省小米四千九百斤。供水股用的管钳子，又贵又少。该股工人为了解决管钳子不够分配的困难，领班方宝树，工匠李玉启、姚仁堂等，在本月五日，自动试修废管钳了七把。试验成功后，就从东直门水厂找来了六十二把，又在第二仓库废品堆里找来了二十九把，现在正在修理。修好一把，就节省小米一百九十五斤。这批废品全部修好后，足够三年使用。
