    Man Jiang Hong
    Patriotic Poem for New Year's Day to Comfort the Troops
    Qian Xiaoshan

    The People's Liberation Army arrives, and everywhere we hear the drums of war cease. The people, men and women, bring pots of food and drink to welcome you, with boundless enthusiasm. Rain washes away the dust and smoke for thousands of miles, and in the solemn night, the watchtowers illuminate the moon in the sky. Good men serve the people, how profound is this devotion! The old humiliation, we will wash away from the beginning. The reactionaries, we will exterminate from this day forward. Look, the world is being reorganized, our territory complete and without flaw. The flag of independence flutters over a democratic nation, the flower of freedom blooms in the blood of heroes. Let us celebrate this peaceful New Year together, and look up to the imperial palace in Beijing.

    满江红
    元旦劳军献词
    钱小山  
    解放军来，听到处鼓鼙声歇。有士女壶浆迎候，几番热烈。雨洗烟尘千里路，夜严刁斗中天月。好男儿服务为人民，情何切。旧耻辱，从头雪。反动派，从今灭。看乾坤整顿，金瓯无缺。独立旗飘民主国，自由花发英雄血。庆和平岁首共称觞，瞻京阙。
