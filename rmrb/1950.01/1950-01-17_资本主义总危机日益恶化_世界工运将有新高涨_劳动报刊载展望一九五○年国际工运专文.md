Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: The Labor Daily recently published a special article by Monin, summarizing the international labor movement since the beginning of 1950, pointing out that the class struggle of the working masses in various capitalist countries will see a new upsurge this year.

Monin first described the strike movements sweeping across the world's continents, stating: Currently, there is no capitalist country that is not in a state of strike unrest. In France, the entire working class sympathetically watches the struggles of workers in the largest aircraft and automobile factories, where workers, in protest strikes against mass layoffs, have occupied some enterprises and do not allow police or scabs sent by reactionaries to enter the factories. City transport workers in Manchester, England, construction workers in London, and miners in Yorkshire have also held strikes. The strike movement is not only developing in Europe and America but also spreading to other continents. In Africa, the miners' strike in British Nigeria has just ended, and another British colony, the Gold Coast, has launched a general strike. The strikers demand the revocation of the order to dismiss 61 workers and demand autonomy for the Gold Coast. In addition, Tunisia experienced a 24-hour general strike on January 6th. Strike movements in Southeast Asia and Australia also have a large scale.

Monin then pointed out: The new wave of strikes in various capitalist countries indicates that the working class is firmly fighting for bread and the right to work, and that the working class, led by the Communist Party and the Workers' Party, has become the leader of all working people, the organizer of their united struggle for economic and democratic rights.

Monin further pointed out: The current upsurge in the strike movement proves that in the context of the increasingly worsening general crisis of capitalism and the imperialists' intense preparations for a new war, the working class's struggle for its immediate interests is inevitably combined with the overall struggle of all peoples for peace, democratic freedom, and independence. As the leading force of the peace and democracy camp, the working class has become the promoter of the struggle against the warmongers. The strike movements launched by trade unions in European countries to protest arms production, refuse to load and unload military supplies for the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, and oppose the colonial wars in Vietnam and Indonesia, the demands of the broad masses in France and Italy to ban atomic weapons, and the World Federation of Trade Unions' announcement calling for powerful anti-war demonstrations to be organized on May Day—all these facts eloquently demonstrate that the powerful movement of peace advocates is rising to a new level.

Monin concluded by pointing out: The growth of the strike movement in 1950 is inseparable from the further unity of the working class. Despite the divisive activities of the splitters in the right-wing social democratic parties, the idea of unity, widely promoted by the Communist Parties of various countries and the World Federation of Trade Unions, has taken increasingly firm root in the hearts of the masses. In the struggle for the immediate interests of ordinary people, working people of all races and political beliefs are uniting their forces to organize a strong united front.

    资本主义总危机日益恶化
    世界工运将有新高涨
    劳动报刊载展望一九五○年国际工运专文
    【新华社北京十六日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报顷发表莫宁的专论，综述一九五○年开始以来的国际工人运动，指出各资本主义国家内劳苦大众的阶级斗争，今年将有新的高涨。
    莫宁首先叙述遍及世界各洲的罢工运动称：现在，没有一个资本主义国家不是处在罢工的动乱之中。在法国，全体工人阶级都同情地注视着最大的飞机和汽车工厂工人的斗争，那里的工人，在反对整批解雇的抗议罢工过程中，占领了一些企业，并且不准反动分子派来的警察或工贼进入工厂。英国曼彻斯特的城市运输工人、伦敦的建筑工人、和约克郡的矿工，也举行了罢工。美国伊里诺斯州现有八万矿工罢工。罢工运动不仅在欧美两洲发展着，而且也蔓延到了其他大陆。在非洲，英属尼日利亚的矿工罢工刚刚结束，另一英属殖民地——黄金海岸就又举行了总罢工。罢工者要求收回解雇六十一名工人的成命，并要求黄金海岸的自主权。此外，突尼斯在一月六日发生了二十四小时的总罢工。东南亚和澳洲各国的罢工运动，也都具有广大的规模。
    莫宁接着指出：各资本主义国家中新的罢工浪潮，表示工人阶级坚决为面包与工作权而斗争，表示由共产党和工人党所领导的工人阶级，已经成为一切劳苦人民的领袖，成为他们争取经济和民主权利的联合斗争的组织者。
    莫宁进而指出：目前罢工运动的高涨证明，在资本主义日益恶化的总危机和帝国主义者紧张进行新战争准备的情况下，工人阶级争取其切身利益的斗争，不可避免地要和各族人民争取和平及民主自由的总斗争结合起来。作为和平民主阵营的领导力量的工人阶级，已成为反对战争贩子的斗争的推动者。欧洲各国工会发动的抗议军备生产、拒绝起卸供给北大西洋侵略集团各国的军火，反对越南和印尼的殖民地战争的罢工运动，法、意广大群众的禁用原子武器的要求，世界工联号召于五一节组织强有力的反战示威的公告——所有这些事实，都雄辩地证明了和平拥护者的强大运动正提高到新的水平。
    莫宁最后指出：一九五○年罢工运动的增长，是和工人阶级进一步的团结分不开的。尽管右翼社会党的分裂分子竭力进行破坏工运的活动，但是各国共产党和世界工联所广泛宣传的团结思想，已在群众心中越来越牢固地生了根。在为普通人民切身利益而进行的斗争中，一切种族和政治信仰的劳动人民，正在联合他们的力量组织为强有力的统一战线。
