    Implementing the New Accounting System
    Emphasizing Responsibility System and Cost Accounting; Each Unit Calculates Profit and Loss Separately; Subjects Also Greatly Simplified Compared to Before.
    The old railway accounting system in various regions was drafted by British and American accounting experts during the warlord rule in 1913. Due to the corrupt rule of the Kuomintang, it has been in use for more than 30 years without substantial modification, and it is no longer suitable for the people's railways. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways adopted the basic principles of the Soviet railway accounting system and, combined with the current environment and conditions of China's railways, formulated a new provisional railway accounting system. The new accounting system emphasizes the responsibility system and cost accounting, classifies by department and nature, and simplifies the subjects greatly compared to before. It stipulates that before the property is cleared and valued, 5% of the operating expenses will be temporarily used as depreciation funds. Starting from January 1st, direct transportation between various railway administrations will implement joint transportation settlement to calculate the profit and loss of each railway administration, correcting the past phenomenon where railway administrations with more originating stations had more operating income, while railway administrations with more transfer stations had less income. In addition, mechanical factories, bridge factories, ticket printing offices, printing houses, newspapers, etc., will all implement enterprise management and calculate profits and losses separately.

    实行新的会计制度
    着重负责制和成本计算，各单位单独计算盈亏；科目亦较前大为简化。
    各地旧有铁路会计制度是一九一三年军阀统治时代由英美会计专家拟定的，由于国民党腐败统治已沿用三十多年，基本上未曾加以修改，早已不合人民铁路应用。因此铁道部乃采用苏联铁路会计制度的基本原则，并结合我国铁路目前环境和条件，制定了新的铁路暂行会计制度。新会计制度着重负责制和成本计算，按部门和性质分类，使科目较前大为简化。其中规定：在财产未清理估价前，暂按营业支出的百分之五作为折旧资金。自一月一日起各管理局间直达运输实行联运清算，以计算各管理局之盈亏情况，纠正过去货物发站较多的管理局营业收入多，而中转站较多的管理局收入较少现象。此外，凡机械厂、桥梁厂、印票所、印刷所、报社等一律实行企业管理，单独计算盈亏。
