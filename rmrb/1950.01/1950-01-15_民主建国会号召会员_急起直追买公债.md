Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: The China Democratic National Construction Association today issued a statement calling on members nationwide to actively subscribe to and make every effort to promote the People's Victory Indexed Bonds. The full text is as follows:

To all local branches and beloved members:

Today, when the people's revolutionary war has achieved a comprehensive and fundamental victory, great and arduous construction work awaits our efforts. The 1950 budget estimate of revenue and expenditure is a blueprint for the initial construction plan of the new China. In order to thoroughly win the victory of the People's Liberation War, to settle and educate the large number of old troops and old personnel left over by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and to rapidly restore the country's production, transportation, culture, education, health and other undertakings, the Central People's Government needs a considerable amount of expenditure; at the same time, it is impossible and unwilling to solve the financial difficulties entirely by increasing taxes or issuing more banknotes. Therefore, it was decided to issue the People's Victory Indexed Bonds, modeled on the indexed savings method, to make up for a part of the financial deficit, thereby contracting currency, stabilizing prices, and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Everyone who buys public bonds is equivalent to saving a sum of money, guaranteeing the principal and interest, and there is no risk of devaluation. It is far more reliable than storing materials. Standing on the people's position, we can only warmly support this extremely guaranteed public bond policy!

During the long and arduous years of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the four-year War of Liberation in China, farmers and workers have contributed money and efforts, shed blood and fought hard, and have fulfilled their greatest responsibility to the country. Most of the members of this association are national industrialists and businessmen, and have not played a sufficient active role in the revolutionary war. Therefore, today, when the revolution has basically triumphed, in order to make up for the shortcomings of our past efforts, we must catch up, actively subscribe to public bonds, and do our best to promote public bonds, help the country solve financial difficulties, and jointly guarantee the smooth implementation of the 1950 budget estimate of revenue and expenditure. We must understand that after purchasing public bonds, even if the turnover of funds is reduced a little, and a little impact is temporarily received, once the economy tends to stabilize, the business can develop normally, and the future gains will be enough to compensate for the immediate losses and more.

		Patiently persuade family and friends to inspire patriotism and love for the people.

In terms of publicity: (1) First, do patient persuasion work to your own families, relatives and friends to inspire their patriotism and love for the people, and at the same time, make them fully understand the reliability and benefit of public bonds, take out private savings, or save a part of the daily expenses to buy public bonds. (2) At any gathering, we must seize the opportunity to explain in detail the benefits of buying public bonds and their political significance. (3) For those who are particularly enthusiastic about buying public bonds, we should use methods such as writing letters to express respect, sending representatives to express respect, and publishing texts to praise them, in order to stimulate the public's enthusiasm for buying public bonds.

In terms of action: (1) If our members are directly in charge of industrial and commercial enterprises, they should propose to buy public bonds with a considerable percentage of the total business income or a few percent of the surplus. If they hold positions in various public and private enterprises or work in people's governments at all levels, they must practice strict economy and squeeze out a few percent of their monthly income to buy public bonds. (2) Launch a movement not to invite guests, not to give gifts, and not to buy New Year's goods, and save the money for inviting guests, giving gifts, and buying New Year's goods to buy public bonds. (3) Try to challenge and compete with colleagues in the same industry and workers. (4) Automatically and actively request to participate in the work of the Public Bond Promotion Committee, regardless of the title, and conduct purchase persuasion work in an all-round way, especially focusing on the targets designated by the government, and call for long-term subscription and early completion of tasks.

Dear members! The People's Victory Indexed Bonds are our glorious burden; publicizing the public bond policy, actively subscribing, and making every effort to promote them are our glorious tasks. Let us take on this task with unparalleled patriotism and love for the people!
	
		I wish you all hard work and successful completion of this glorious task! Best regards,
	
Respectfully,

China Democratic National Construction Association

    民主建国会号召会员
    急起直追买公债
            买了公债等于储蓄保本保息可靠有利
    【新华社北京十四日电】民主建国会今日发表文告，号召全国会员踊跃认购和尽力推销人民胜利折实公债。全文如下：
    各地分会并转各位亲爱的会员同志们：
    在人民革命战争业已取得了全面的基本的胜利的今天，伟大而艰巨的建设工作，正待我们努力。一九五○年度财政收支概算，是新中国初步建设计划的图案。中央人民政府为要彻底争取人民解放战争的胜利，为要安置和教育国民党反动派遗留下来的大批的旧军队和旧人员，为要迅速恢复全国的生产、交通、文教、卫生等事业，需要为数颇巨的支出；同时，不可能也不愿意全部从增加税收或增发钞票来解决财政困难，因此才决定仿照折实储蓄的办法，发行人民胜利折实公债，用以弥补一部分财政赤字，从而收缩通货，稳定物价，安定民生。大家买了公债，等于储蓄了一笔款项，保本保息，决无贬值之虞，远比储存物资为可靠。我们站在人民立场，对于这种极有保证的公债政策，只有热烈的拥护！
    中国在八年抗日战争和四年解放战争的漫长而艰辛的岁月中，农工同胞出钱出力，流血拼命，对国家已经尽到了他们最大的责任。本会会员大部分是民族工商业者，在革命战争中，还没有发挥足够的积极性。因此，在革命已经基本胜利的今天，我们为了弥补过去努力不够的缺憾，必须急起直追，踊跃的认购公债，尽力的推销公债，帮助国家解决财政困难，共同保证一九五○年度财政收支概算的顺利执行。必须明白：在购买公债之后，即使资金周转减少了一些，一时的受到一点影响，但经济一趋稳定，营业即可正常的发展，将来的收获是足以补偿眼前的损失而有余的。
            向家属亲友耐心宣传说服，激发爱国家爱人民的热情。
    在宣传方面：（一）先向自己的家庭、亲戚、朋友作耐心的说服工作，激发他们爱国家，爱人民的热情，同时使他们充分明了公债的可靠和有利，把私蓄拿出来，或者把日常费用节约一部分下来买公债。（二）在任何的集会里，都要争取机会，详细说明购买公债的利益和在政治上的意义。（三）对于购买公债特别热心的人士，我们应该用写信致敬，派代表表示敬意，发表文字表扬等方法，借以激发大众购买公债的热情。
    在行动方面：（一）我们会员同志如系直接主持工商事业，应提出营业总收入的相当成数或盈余的几分之几来买公债，如系担任各种公私营企业的职务或在各级人民政府工作，必须厉行节约，挤出每月所得的几分之几来买公债。（二）发起不请客、不送礼、不办年货的运动，把请客、送礼和办年货的钱省下来买公债。（三）尽量向同行同业同工进行挑战和比赛。（四）自动的积极的要求参加公债推销委员会的工作，不拘名义，全面的进行劝购工作，尤应注重于政府所指定的对象，并号召长期认购和提前完成任务。
    亲爱的会员同志们！人民胜利折实公债，是我们光荣的负担；宣传公债政策，踊跃认购，尽力推销，是我们光荣的任务。我们用无比的爱国家爱人民的热情来担负起这个任务吧！
        敬祝大家努力，胜利的完成这一个光荣的任务！顺致
    敬礼
                                           民主建国会启
                                     一九五○年一月十四日
