    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 26th: According to Associated Press and Reuters dispatches from Jakarta, the so-called "rebel troops" led by Dutch Army Captain Westerling captured Bandung, an important town in West Java, on the 23rd. The Indonesian government's "federal army" stationed there did not put up any serious resistance, and the entire battle lasted only ten minutes. After looting extensively, the "Westerling troops" withdrew from Bandung that night.
    The Associated Press stated that the core of the "Westerling troops" is composed of Dutch-trained airborne troops, commandos, and Dutch army "deserters." They demanded that the Republic of Indonesia recognize them as the "official authority" of West Java, otherwise they would revolt. It is reported that Westerling is supported by influential figures in the Netherlands and Britain, and has obtained arms and equipment with their help.
    This attack surprised the Indonesian puppet government, which considered the "situation to be very critical." But at the same time, they are also negotiating with the Dutch authorities to incorporate the "Westerling troops" into the Indonesian armed forces. This shows that the so-called Westerling rebellion is related to the Dutch imperialists' efforts to strengthen their control over the Indonesian puppet army.

    在荷帝英帝支持下
    “威斯特灵部队”劫掠爪哇重镇万隆
    【新华社北京二十六日电】据美联社、路透社雅加达消息，由荷军一上尉威斯特灵率领的所谓“叛乱部队”，于二十三日攻占西爪哇的重镇万隆。驻守该地的印尼政府“联邦军”未进行任何严重抵抗，全部战事仅历时十分钟。“威斯特灵部队”在大肆抢掠之后，已于当晚退出万隆。
    美联社称，“威斯特灵部队”的核心是由荷兰训练的空运部队、突击队员以及荷军“逃兵”组成的。他们要求印尼合众国承认他们是西爪哇的“官方权力机关”，否则即进行叛乱。据悉，威斯特灵受到荷兰和英国方面有势力人士的支持，并且在他们的帮助之下得到军火和装备。
    这次袭击使印尼傀儡政府感到惊异，并认为“情势很危急”。但同时他们又在与荷兰当局进行谈判，要将“威斯特灵部队”并入印尼武装部队。这说明了所谓威斯特灵的叛乱与荷兰帝国主义者力谋加强对印尼傀儡军的控制有关。
