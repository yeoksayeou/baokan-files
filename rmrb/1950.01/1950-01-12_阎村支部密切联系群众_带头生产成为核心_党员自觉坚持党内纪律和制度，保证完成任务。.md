    (From Our Newspaper) The Communist Party branch in Yan Village, Anguo County, Hebei Province, has become the leading core of the village's production work. The village established its Party branch in 1938 and now has 102 Party members, accounting for more than 5% of the village's population (2,015 people). Through long-term struggles, they have gained relatively rich work experience and can closely connect with the masses. Most Party members measure themselves in their work and study by the reflections of the masses. The branch has 29 female Party members, who are even more active than the male Party members. They all work in the fields and have also led 629 women in the village to participate in production, accounting for two-thirds of the village's total labor force.

    The branch promotes democracy, and leads the work in a planned and divided manner. Last year, it successfully completed the cotton planting task, and the autumn grain levy and wheat levy work were completed within one day. Each time after accepting a work task, the branch committee first makes careful plans, then mobilizes within the Party. After the Party members' thinking is straightened out, they are divided into groups for discussion to determine the plan. Then, according to the nature of the work, Party members in various departments are assigned to play a guaranteeing role and promote the work of various departments. Then, they separately invite prestigious old farmers to help, and cadres from various departments convene mass meetings by segment to mobilize the masses. The plans are discussed and revised by the masses to become the masses' plans, ensuring their completion. Wang Detai, the branch's propaganda committee member, said: "No matter what work, we must first straighten out the thinking of Party members, and never rush to deploy downward, otherwise, it will be a disaster. Speaking of planting cotton, Party members still said they would suffer losses and were afraid of fixed official prices, let alone the masses? Later, after explaining the significance of planting cotton, the Party members straightened out their thinking and worked happily, and quickly brought the masses along." During the execution of the work, the branch committee divides the work, collects the problems that occur at any time, and solves them at any time. The branch committee can timely analyze the ideological situation of Party members, and can also specifically organize and grasp the strength of Party members. For example, Party members Li Sanqiao, Nie Dashuan, Meng Zhujiao, etc., were lagging behind in their work and study. The branch committee assigned tasks to personally supervise and help them, so that they gradually changed.

    The village branch and Party members can adhere to the system and use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. Group meetings are held every first day of the ten-day period, study meetings are held every sixth day, and branch committee meetings are held every fourth and ninth day, without interruption from last autumn to now. There is a leave system for meetings. Those who do not ask for leave and do not attend will be given appropriate criticism and education. The content of the meetings is relatively rich, including self-criticism, work arrangements, and work requirements. At each meeting, according to the prescribed content, Party members are asked to report and self-criticize the situation of implementation. After research and self-criticism, the branch committee makes a summary and proposes the next task. In addition, there is a "merit evaluation" system. After each central task is completed, the branch makes a summary based on the feedback from the groups and the understanding of the branch committee, evaluates the merits and demerits of Party members, submits it to the group for discussion and approval, and announces it at the Party member meeting to encourage and educate Party members. Because the branch committee adheres to the system and sets an example, all Party members in the village attach great importance to meeting life. They believe: "You don't know progress if you don't attend meetings, and you don't know mistakes if you don't make self-criticism." One Party member said: "It's not good to miss a meeting. You can't catch up if you miss it once."

    The branch's education adopts a combination of explanation and temporary question-and-answer, and is carried out in branch units. The education of the branch is carried out separately by four branches. The content of the education is roughly divided into three types: textbook education, practical education, and ideological education. The method is a combination of explanation and temporary question-and-answer. When speaking, let those who are clumsy or new Party members speak first. Finally, draw conclusions according to the spirit of the textbook. In study discussions, they can all connect with reality, such as discussing "What are the requirements for joining the Party? Which ones can you do?" and "How do Party members unite the masses?" During the discussion, Party members also conduct self-criticism based on the documents. Generally, Party members have high enthusiasm for learning. Zhang Sengzi even brings a notebook to study when weeding; female Party members are even more enthusiastic about learning. They are ashamed of being illiterate and proud of learning to write letters. The branch also pays close attention to the practical education of Party members. When the militia member Nie Dashuan was irresponsible, the branch secretary summoned the Party members who participated in the militia to discuss the topic: "What responsibilities does the militia have? What should be done if they are irresponsible?" to educate him to correct himself.

    Although the education of the village branch has achieved many results, some Party members still have a relatively strong selfish and self-interested peasant ideology. When work comes, they often consider their own interests. Individual Party members think that the land reform has been carried out, the environment is peaceful, the new China has been established, and the revolutionary work is also being done. It's okay to be a Party member who is neither advanced nor backward. These still need further education and transformation.

### 阎村支部密切联系群众  带头生产成为核心  党员自觉坚持党内纪律和制度，保证完成任务。

    阎村支部密切联系群众
    带头生产成为核心
    党员自觉坚持党内纪律和制度，保证完成任务。
    【本报讯】河北省安国县阎村的中共支部，已成为全村生产工作的领导核心。该村在一九三八年建党，现有党员一百零二人，占全村人口（二千零十五人）的百分之五强。他们在长期斗争中，获得了比较丰富的工作经验，能密切联系群众。大部分党员在工作上、学习上都以群众的反映来衡量自己。支部有女党员二十九名，比男党员还活跃，全部下地生产，还带动了全村六百二十九个妇女参加生产，占了全村总劳动力的三分之二。
    支部发扬民主、有计划、有分工地领导工作的进行。去年顺利完成了种棉任务，秋征和麦征工作，都在一天之内就完成了。每次接受工作任务以后，支委先作周密计划，接着在党内动员，党员思想搞通后再分组讨论，决定计划；再按工作的性质，责成各部门里的党员起保证作用，推动各部门工作进行。然后分头请有威信的老农帮助，由各部门干部分片召开群众会，把群众都动员起来，经群众的讨论修正变成群众的计划，保证其完成。支部宣传委员王德太说：“无论什么工作，要先打通党员思想，千万别慌着往下布置，着急就准糟。按种棉说，党员们还说吃亏，怕定官价，何况群众呢？后来经过解释种棉意义，党员搞通思想，干的也欢，忽啦把群众带起来了。”工作执行中，支委进行分工，随时搜集发生的问题，随时解决。支委能及时分析党员的思想情况，还能具体组织和掌握党员的力量。如党员李三桥、聂大拴、孟柱角等，工作学习都落后。支委便分工亲自督促、帮助，使其逐渐转变过来。
    该村支部与党员能坚持制度并运用批评与自我批评的武器。每旬逢一是小组会，逢六是学习会，逢四、九是支委会，从去年秋天到现在从未间断。会议有请假制度，不请假而不到会的给以适当批评教育。会议内容比较丰富，有检讨、有工作布置和工作要求。每次会根据规定的内容，让党员汇报和检讨执行的情形，经研究检讨后，由支委做总结，并提出下次的任务。另外还有“评功论过”制度，每一中心工作完成以后，根据小组反映和支委的了解，由支部作出总结，评出党员的功劳过失，交小组讨论通过后到党员大会上宣布，以鼓励教育党员。由于支委的坚持制度，以身作则，全村党员对会议生活很重视，他们认为：“不开会不知进步，不检讨不知错误。”一个党员说：“误了会可不行，丢一次就赶不上。”
            支部教育采讲解与临时问答相结合的方式，以分支为单位进行。
    支部的教育由四个分支分别进行，教育内容大体上分课本教育、实际教育、思想教育三种。进行的方式是讲解结合临时问答。发言时先让嘴笨的或新党员先说。最后按课本精神作结论。在学习讨论中都能联系实际，如讨论“入党条件，你能做到那几条”、“党员怎样团结群众”等。讨论中，党员并依据文件进行检讨。一般党员学习情绪都高，张僧子锄地时还带着本子学习；女党员学习更热情，她们以不识字为耻辱，以学会写信为光荣。支部对党员的实际教育也抓得紧。民兵聂大拴不负责任，支书就把参加民兵的党员召集起来出题讨论，题目是：“民兵负什么责任？不负责任怎么办？”以此来教育他改正。
    该村支部的教育虽然得到了不少成绩，但党员中有些人自私自利的农民思想还相当浓厚，工作来了，往往从本身利益计较；个别党员以为土地改革了，环境太平了，新中国成立了，革命工作也作着，落个不前不后的党员就算了。这些还待进一步的教育改造。
