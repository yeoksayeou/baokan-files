    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 4th -- TASS, New York: The defense lawyers for the eleven American Communist leaders requested the Federal Court of Appeals on December 31st to extend the deadline for their formal appeal to August 15, 1950. The Federal Court of Appeals had previously set February 15th as the date for them to submit the formal documents required for this appeal. The defense lawyers declared that the trial of the American Communist leaders had lasted for nine months, and the accumulated records were voluminous. Therefore, it was impossible to adequately prepare for the appeal in such a short period. According to American law, the defense lawyers must submit printed copies of the trial records relevant to the appeal and duplicates of various evidence. The defense lawyers pointed out that the preparation of the extensive evidence necessary for the appeal would take at least four months, and the cost of printing the necessary documents would be over $65,000. This is further evidence of the class nature of American justice.

    美共领袖辩护律师
    要求展期上诉
    【新华社北京四日电】塔斯社纽约讯：十一位美共领袖的辩护律师，于十二月三十一日要求联邦上诉法院把他们正式上诉的日期延至一九五零年八月十五日。联邦上诉法院前曾规定二月十五日为他们提交这次上诉所需要的正式文书的日期。辩护律师们宣称：对美共领袖的审讯，曾经进行了九个月，这个期间内所积累的记录卷帙浩繁，因此，在这样短的期间内从事上诉的充分准备是不可能的。根据美国的法律，辩护律师必须提交以前审讯记录中有关上诉部分的印刷本，和各种证据的复本。辩护律师们指出：准备上诉所必需的篇幅浩繁的证据，至少需时四个月，而印刷必要的文件的费用，将在六万五千美元以上。这是美国司法的阶级性的又一明证。
