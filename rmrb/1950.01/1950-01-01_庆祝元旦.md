    Celebrating New Year's Day
    Ma Xulun
    The New Year of 1950 has arrived, and we must celebrate it enthusiastically.
    The New Year of 1950 is truly worthy of enthusiastic celebration, as it is the first New Year after the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people have stood up, and the enemies of the Chinese people have fallen. The arrival of 1950 tells us that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the entire Chinese people have overthrown feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, expelled imperialism, and achieved the basic victory of the revolution. The reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has been destroyed on the Chinese mainland, and before long, all of China will be liberated. Isn't this worth celebrating enthusiastically?
    Equally worthy of our enthusiastic celebration is Chairman Mao's visit to Moscow less than three months after the founding of the People's Republic of China, where he was immediately received by Marshal Stalin. This meeting of the world's two great revolutionary leaders has delighted and inspired the Chinese people. The meeting between Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin signifies the increasingly consolidated Sino-Soviet friendship and the further strengthening of the world's democratic peace camp.
    The Soviet people are the true friends of the Chinese people, and Stalin is the true friend of the Chinese people. It is Stalin and the Soviet people who can truly help us. Chairman Mao has already taken our feelings of gratitude to the Soviet Union on behalf of us. This is a sublime manifestation of internationalism and patriotism that we must experience and learn from.
    The meeting between Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin symbolizes the even closer union of 675 million people. This is a great force that will guarantee the further strengthening of the world's peace and democracy camp, leading to lasting world peace.
    Celebrating the first New Year after the founding of the People's Republic of China, celebrating the meeting between Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin, in 1950 we must carry the revolutionary war through to the end to achieve lasting peace for China and the world.
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao!
    Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!
    Long live lasting world peace!

    马叙伦
    一九五○年的新年到了，我们要热烈庆祝。
    一九五○年的新年是实在值得热烈庆祝的，它是中华人民共和国成立后的第一个新年。中国人民站起来了，中国人民的敌人倒下去了。一九五○年的来临，告诉我们，全中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，已经打倒了封建主义和官僚资本主义，驱逐了帝国主义，取得了革命的基本胜利。国民党的反动统治在中国大陆上已被摧毁，不要很久全中国将要得到解放，这难道不值得我们热烈庆祝吗？
    同样值得我们热烈庆祝的，毛主席在中华人民共和国成立后不到三月即访问莫斯科，并立即为斯大林大元帅接见，这世界二大革命领袖的会晤是中国人民所欢欣鼓舞的。毛主席和斯大林大元帅的会晤表示了中苏邦交日益巩固，世界民主和平阵营更形强大。
    苏联人民是中国人民真正的朋友，斯大林是中国人民真正的朋友，真正能够帮助我们的是斯大林和苏联人民，毛主席已经代表我们把感谢的心情带到苏联去了。这是国际主义和爱国主义的崇高表现，我们要体验，要学习。
    毛主席和斯大林大元帅的会晤，象征了六万万七千五百万人民更紧密地结合在一起了，这是伟大的力量，它将保证世界和平民主阵营的更形强大，以致获得世界的持久和平。
    庆祝中华人民共和国成立后第一个新年，庆祝毛主席和斯大林大元帅会晤，一九五○年我们要将革命战争进行到底，来获得中国和世界的持久和平。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    中苏友好万岁！
