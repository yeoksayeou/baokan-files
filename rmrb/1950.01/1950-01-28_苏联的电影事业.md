    The Soviet Film Industry
    Films Penetrate the Most Remote Corners of the Country
    Some time ago, the Central Committee of the Trade Union of Workers in Culture and Education of the Soviet Union held a national conference to discuss the development of the national film industry. Lyozanov, Deputy Minister of the Soviet Film Industry Department, reported at the meeting that the Soviet Union's network of cinemas and film stations is constantly expanding, and its number has now greatly exceeded the pre-war level. Films have now been popularized to the most remote villages and towns in the country. Farmers in Kyrgyz, Kazakh, Tashkent and other Soviet Republics, who did not know what a movie was 25 years ago, can now see the latest Soviet films in their own villages. Those villages without cinemas are supplied by mobile film stations. Depending on the region and season, film workers use airplanes, cars, horses, camels, or dog sleds to send films to all parts of the country. Currently, there are 11,500 mobile film stations touring and screening films in Soviet villages. This year, approximately 6,800 new cinemas and film stations will be opened, of which 6,400 will be located in rural areas. Thousands of new film projectors and trucks used by circulating film stations are being transported to various places. The Soviet Film Industry Department will spend more than 280 million rubles this year to expand the film network.

    Colleges and Universities Use Films to Assist Lectures
    The use of films to assist lectures in Soviet colleges and universities has recently become increasingly common. According to a resolution of the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education, film production studios have been established in larger colleges and universities. At the beginning of the new academic year, more schools in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Tartu, Omsk and other cities have established similar research studios. These film production studios will produce various educational films, which will then be shown to students. Colleges and universities write their own permanent film scripts. For example, Moscow University already has 2,500 film scripts, including many unique films, such as the film "Experiments of Academician Pavlov" for the animal physiology course and valuable films about the great natural transformer Michurin. Leningrad University also has some rare films, such as "Mechanical Language" and "Sign Language of North American Indians." Medical schools also have many valuable educational films. Currently, several new films are being produced by Soviet technical film production factories according to orders from the Ministry of Higher Education, including "Introduction to Foundry," "Powder Metallurgy," "Atoms and Atomic Nuclei," and "Jet Propulsion."

    苏联的电影事业
    电影深入全国最僻远的角落
    前些日子，苏联文化教育工作者工会中央委员会召开全国会议，讨论了全国电影事业的发展，苏联电影事业部副部长廖扎诺夫在会上报告说：苏联的电影院和电影站纲正在不断扩展，其数目现已大大超过战前。电影现已普及到全国最僻远的村镇了。基尔吉兹、卡查赫、塔什克及其他苏维埃共和国的农民在二十五年以前还不知电影为何物，但现在却在自己的村子里看见苏联最新出的影片了。那些没有电影院的乡村则有流动电影站供应一般居民。电影工作者按照地区与季节，乘着飞机、汽车、马、骆驼或狗橇等，将影片送至全国各地。目前有一万一千五百个流动电影站在苏联乡村巡回放映。今年将共开设新的电影院和电影站约六千八百所，其中六千四百所设在乡村。流通电影站使用的数千台新电影机和卡车正在运往各地。苏联电影事业部为了扩展电影网，今年将开支两亿八千余卢布。
    高等学校利用电影帮助讲课
    苏联各高等学校里利用电影帮助讲课的最近已愈来愈多了。根据苏联高等教育部的决议，规模较大的高等学校里都已设立了制片研究室。在新学年开始时，莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、塔尔图、鄂木斯克及其他城市有更多的学校设立了同样的研究室。这些制片研究室将摄制各种教育影片，然后映给学生看。各高等学校都自己编写永久性的影片脚本。如莫斯科大学就已有影片脚本两千五百部之多，其中包括许多举世无双的影片，如动物生理学课程的影片“大学士巴甫洛夫的实验”和关于伟大自然改造家米邱林的珍贵影片等。列宁格勒大学也有一些稀罕的影片，如“机械语言”、“北美印第安人的手势语”等。医科学校也有很多极有价值的教育影片。目前苏联各技术影片摄制厂接受高等教育部的订单，正在摄制若干新片，其中有“铸造学初步”、“粉末冶金术”、“原子与原子核”、“喷射推进学”等。
