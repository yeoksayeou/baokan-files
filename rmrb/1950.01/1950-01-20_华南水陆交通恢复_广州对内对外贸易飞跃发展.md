South China's Water and Land Transportation Restored
    Guangzhou's Domestic and Foreign Trade Develops by Leaps and Bounds
    Grain Reserves of South China Grain Company Sufficient for Guangzhou's Needs for Half a Year

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Since the liberation of Guangzhou, South China's domestic and foreign trade has been developing rapidly due to the swift restoration of water and land transportation, and customs duties have also increased significantly. Since the Guangzhou Military Control Commission's Trade Department began operations on November 16th last year, it has vigorously supported the development of import and export industries and encouraged the export of local products. Although trade and foreign exchange settlement methods could not be announced immediately in the initial stages, the Military Control Commission temporarily allowed self-provided foreign exchange imports to accommodate the difficulties of merchants. On the export side, general reliable exporters were allowed to proceed with exports after obtaining guarantees from commercial banks, and then later complete foreign exchange settlements. This not only ensured the import of materials beneficial to the people's livelihood but also enabled importers to obtain certain legitimate profits. To further develop domestic and foreign trade, promote urban-rural exchange, and regulate local and municipal food supplies, the Guangzhou Military Control Commission successively established the South China Foreign Trade Company and the South China Grain, Cotton Cloth, Sugar, Local Products, and Salt Industries Companies, as well as the Guangzhou Municipal Trade Company in mid-December last year, to carry out various businesses separately. After its establishment, the South China Grain Company achieved great success in controlling grain prices and has prepared enough grain to meet the needs of the entire city for six months. In addition to vigorously supplying materials to the market and stabilizing prices, the Cotton Cloth Company has also conducted surveys and registrations of the city's fabric, textile, dyeing, and other industries, preparing to provide necessary support. The Sugar and Local Products Company will purchase new Liuhua sugar on the market at reasonable prices and will start local product sales and establish warehouses this month.

	Import and Export Trade Volume Doubles, Tax Revenue Exceeds Pre-War Levels
    Regarding foreign trade, since the announcement of the foreign exchange settlement method in early December last year, the government has not only strengthened foreign exchange management, enabling imported materials to better meet national needs, but also import and export manufacturers have expressed their support for the government's measures because they can obtain certain profits. Therefore, the volume of trade is gradually increasing. For example, the third week of December increased by 100% compared to the second week, and the fourth week increased by 100% compared to the third week. In terms of tax revenue, the total value of income in December increased by 216% compared to the total value in November, and 189% compared to the monthly average of the highest three months before liberation (July, August, and September). This, on the one hand, illustrates the increase in imported goods compared to the past, and on the other hand, illustrates the serious smuggling during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the impact of their traitorous agreement tax rates on tax revenue.

	Central District Traffic Becomes Increasingly Frequent, Urban and Rural Areas Take on a New Look
    The increasingly frequent domestic and foreign trade in South China and the successive resumption of navigation and traffic on major water and land transportation lines are the main reasons for this. In particular, the rapid resumption of inland river shipping in Guangzhou is closely related to the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government's timely improvement of inland river security and the abolition of the Kuomintang's various exploitative acts against shipping and unreasonable special wharf donations. According to relevant sources, foreign transportation had not fully recovered at the beginning of Guangzhou's liberation, but from November onwards, the number of import and export ships increased sharply, far exceeding the highest number of inland river vessels entering and leaving port during the Kuomintang's rule. In addition, the central district, which has a reputation as a land of fish and rice, has seen very frequent traffic. The main materials transported from various places to Guangzhou from November 25th to December 15th (three weeks) included: over 800 bags and 8.8 million catties of grain, over 2,600 bags and 3.8 million catties of rice, and large quantities of edible oil, salt, vegetables, firewood, live pigs, fresh fish, chickens, ducks, geese, fruits, flour, beans, sugar, etc. The main materials exported to various rivers included cigarettes, tobacco, paper, rubber shoes, and medicinal materials. For example, in Huizhou, in the Dongjiang River basin, trade is booming due to the restoration of transportation. The daily cargo volume in December last year increased by 100% compared to before liberation.

    With Guangzhou as the center, the increasingly smooth water and land transportation and the increasingly active exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the situation of domestic and foreign trade in South China has taken on a new look, playing an important role in restoring the entire South China economy.

    华南水陆交通恢复
    广州对内对外贸易飞跃发展
    华南粮食公司存粮足供广州半年需用
    【本报讯】华南自广州解放后由于水陆交通的迅速恢复，内外贸易正飞速发展，关税亦显著增加。广州军管会贸易部自去年十一月十六日开始办公以来，即大力扶植进出口业的发展，鼓励土产输出。初期虽然贸易办法及结汇办法未克即时公布，但为照顾商民困难，军管会即暂准自备外汇输入。输出方面对一般切实可靠之出口商，在取得商业银行担保后，亦允其先行办理出口，日后再补行结汇。这样不但保证了有利于国民生计的物资输入，并使进口商获得一定的合法利润。该市军管会为进一步发展内外贸易，促进城乡交流、调剂各地及本市民食，去年十二月中先后成立了华南对外贸易公司及华南粮食、纱布、糖业土产、盐业四大公司以及广州市贸易公司，分别展开各项业务。华南粮食公司成立后，对粮价掌握上曾获很大成绩，并已准备足供全市人民六个月需用的粮食。纱布公司，除大力在市场供售物资、平抑物价外，并对该市匹头、纺织、漂染等业进行调查登记，准备予以必要的扶植。糖业土产公司则以合理价格收购市上新榴花糖，并将在本月内开办土产购销，建立仓库。
            进出口贸易量倍增税收超过战前水平
    对外贸易方面自去年十二月初结汇办法公布后。不仅政府加强了外汇管理，使进口物资更能适应国家需要，进出口厂商因可获一定利润，对政府此种措施，极表拥护，故贸易数量正逐步上升。如十二月第三周比第二周增加一倍，而第四周又比第三周增加一倍。税收方面，十二月收入总值即较十一月总值增加百分之二一六，较解放前最高的七、八、九三个月每月平均数增加百分之一八九。这一方面说明了进口货的较前增加，另一方面也说明了国民党反动派统治时期严重的走私及其卖国协定税率对税收的影响。
            中区交通日益频繁城乡关焕然一新
    华南内外贸易的日趋频繁，各主要水陆交通干线的相继复航、通车实为主要原因之一，尤以广州市内河航运的迅速复航，与广州市人民政府及时搞好内河治安、取消国民党统治时代形形色色对航运的剥削行为与不合理的码头特别捐是密切不可分的。据有关方面称，广州解放之初对外交通还未完全恢复，但从十一月以后，进出口船渡激增，远超出国民党反动派统治时期最高内河船只出入口的数字者外，向有渔米之乡称誉的中区交通亦甚为频繁，各地对广州市的贸易，自十一月二十五日到十二月十五日的三个星期内，输入该市的主要物资有：谷八百余包又八百八十万斤，米二千六百余包又三百八十万斤，及大量食油、盐、蔬菜、柴、生猪、鲜鱼、鸡、鸭、鹅、水果、面粉、豆类、糖等。输出到各江的主要物资有香烟、烟草、纸张、胶鞋、药材等。如东江流域的惠州。由于交通的恢复，贸易即蒸蒸日上，去年十二月间每日运货量较解放前增加一倍。
    由于以广州为中心的水陆交通日趋畅通，城乡内外物资交流日益活跃，华南内外贸易的局面已焕然一新，对恢复整个华南经济起着重要的作用。
