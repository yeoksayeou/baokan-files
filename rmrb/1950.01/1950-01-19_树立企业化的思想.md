Title: Establishing Enterprise-Oriented Thinking

Economic accounting is the concretization of enterprise operation, and enterprise-oriented thinking is a prerequisite for implementing and carrying out economic accounting. One of the contents of economic accounting – determining fixed assets and working capital – is the material basis for establishing enterprise-oriented thinking. We put forward the slogan of “enterprise operation” very early, and we have also done some work in implementing economic accounting. For example, we have cleared assets, established cost accounting and accounting systems, and established some systems for protecting tools and machines, saving, and other aspects, implemented planned costs, and determined various quota systems. However, because our "enterprise operation" thinking has not been established, there are also quite a few deviations. For example, when we make plans, whether in terms of output, raw material consumption, expenditure, cost staffing, or technical quotas, they are all relatively generous. According to the formulation of the 1950 plan, the cost plans of some factories exceeded this year's. Comrades working in factories may think this way: ① Be generous in planning to show good results; ② Anyway, regardless of whether the factory is operating or not, making money or not, the factory will always be open, and wages will always be paid; ③ Even if the cost is low, it will be high when added to the huge expenses of the superiors, so why bother?

As a result, the meaning of "planning" is diluted. The root cause mainly lies in the failure to establish enterprise-oriented thinking. In addition, some enterprise leading units stipulate that "factories are only responsible for production, and supply and marketing are the responsibility of the leaders." Division of labor is correct, which can make factories specialize in production, but due to the mechanical execution and inappropriate specific issues, the "economic accounting system" is also diluted. For example, when it comes to purchasing raw materials, the factory always feels that the leadership does not buy things in a timely manner, so they make more plans. Generally, the leadership is not familiar enough with the production situation, and the purchase of materials is not timely, and even unsuitable, regardless of price. During transportation, some add the transportation costs to the accounts of the leading units, and they don’t care whether the transportation costs are expensive or cheap, and the factory doesn’t care either. Here is a specific example: The Dalian Industrial Department transported raw materials to a factory, and the loading and unloading fee per ton by the transportation workers was 6,000 yuan. At first, the factory thought that the Industrial Department was responsible anyway, and did not care; later, it was discovered that the loading and unloading fee was transferred to the factory, so it negotiated with the supply and marketing department of the Industrial Department, because it only cost 1,800 yuan per ton for the factory workers to load and unload themselves. There are many such examples. Recently, some factories, based on the "enterprise-oriented thinking," re-examined various quotas and calculated costs, and as a result, they were reduced by one percent compared to the original plan.

Connecting to this issue, we are reminded that "determining fixed assets and working capital" is indeed a very important part of the "economic accounting system." After the determination, the leaders of the factory will pay attention to the issue of making money and losing money. If they lose money, the factory cannot do it, and wages cannot be paid; products will not be backlogged, and if there is too much backlog, capital cannot be turned over, and wages cannot be paid out; raw materials will not be over-planned, because too much backlog will also backlog funds. Scrap steel, waste iron, and some materials unrelated to the factory's production will not be left untreated, because that is also backlog of funds. When the capital turnover is fast, the profit will increase accordingly. With this surplus capital, we can build more new factories. Some comrades may worry that this implementation will hinder the unified allocation of funds, but in fact it is not the case. Each factory deposits cash in the bank and reports to the superior financial department, and the expenditure meets the budget, and unified dispatch is not difficult. Of course, if this work is to be done well, enterprise-oriented thinking must be established. But on the other hand, this provision is the material basis for "enterprise-oriented thinking." Some enterprise leaders have already paid attention to this work, and we hope that it will be implemented in practical work.

    树立企业化的思想
    波
    经济核算制是企业化的具体化，而企业化思想则是实施与贯彻经济核算制的先决条件。经济核算制内容之一——确定固定资产与流动资产则又是建立企业化思想的物质基础。我们很早就提出企业化的口号，在实施经济核算制方面我们也做了些工作。比如清理资产，建立了成本核算及会计制度，也建立了保护工具机器，节约及其他方面的一些制度，实施了计划成本，确定了各种定额制度。但由于我们的“企业化”思想未树立起来，偏差也是相当多的。比如，我们做计划，无论在产量、原材料耗用量、经费开支、成本定员、技术定额方面都是较宽的。根据这次制订一九五○年的计划看来，有些工厂的成本计划超过了今年。做工厂工作的同志可能这样想：①宽打窄用，可显出成绩来；②反正不管开工不开工，赚钱不赚钱，工厂总是要开，工资也总是要发；③成本虽低，加上上级的庞大开支也就高了，何必呢？
    这样一来，“计划”的意义就冲淡了。产生的根源，主要的是企业化思想未能树立。还有，有些企业领导单位规定“工厂只管生产，供销由领导上负责”，分工是对的，这样可使工厂专责于生产，但由于执行上的机械以及某些具体问题上的不恰当，也冲淡了“经济核算制”。比如以购买原材料来说，在工厂总觉得领导上买东西不及时，于是做计划时多做一些。在领导上一般对生产情况不够熟悉，采购物资不够及时，甚至不合用，贵贱不管。运输时有的将运输费加在领导单位的帐上，运输费贵贱不在乎，工厂亦不闻不问。兹举一具体例子：大连工业厅给某工厂运输原料，由运搬工人装卸，每吨装卸费六千元。开始工厂认为反正由工业厅负责，不闻不问；后来发觉装卸费转到工厂来了，乃向工业厅供销处交涉，因由工厂工人自己装卸每吨只用一千八百元。这样的例子很多。最近有的工厂本着“企业化思想”，重新审查各种定额，又计算了成本，结果较原来计划减低了百分之一。
    连系到这个问题，使我们又想到：“确定固定资产与流动资产”在“经济核算制”中的确是很重要的一环。确定之后，工厂的领导者就会注意到赚钱与赔钱的问题，赔钱，工厂不能干，工资不能开；产品也不会积压了，积压太多，资本不能周转，工资开不出去；原材料也不会多做计划了，因积压多了也会积压资金。废钢烂铁和一些本工厂生产无关的物资也不会不加以处理了，因那样也是积压资金。资金周转快了，利润即随之增加，以这有余的资金我们可多多建设几个新的工厂。有的同志可能顾虑这样实行起来会妨碍资金的统一调拨，实际上并不然。各工厂现金存在银行里向上级财务部门做报告，开支符合预算，统一调度并无困难的。当然这个工作如果要做好，企业化思想必须树立起来。但另外一方面，这个规定又是“企业化思想”的物质基础。这个工作有些企业领导同志已经注意，我们希望在实际工作中予以贯彻。
