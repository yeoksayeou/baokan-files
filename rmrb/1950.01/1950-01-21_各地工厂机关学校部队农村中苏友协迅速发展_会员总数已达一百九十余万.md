Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 20th: Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations are developing rapidly across the country and have now become a powerful mass organization. According to incomplete statistics as of the end of last December, more than 150 branches and sub-branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have been established in various regions, with more than 3,980 branches and sub-branches, and a total membership of more than 1.9 million people. The association's members are not only found in factories, government offices, schools, and military units in major and medium-sized cities, but also in many county towns and villages. For example, among the 36,456 members of the Rehe Province Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branch, farmers account for half. The rapid development of Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations among all strata of the Chinese people signifies the further development and consolidation of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

    The activities of Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations throughout the country are extremely broad, including publishing books and periodicals, holding seminars, lectures, exhibitions, street promotions, screening Soviet films, and running Russian language classes. All these activities have had a great effect on helping the Chinese people understand the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union, and strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. According to statistics, in the Northeast region (including the Lushun-Dalian area) alone, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations organized 5,830 report meetings, seminars, and exhibitions in the past six months, screened 839 Soviet films, and involved a total of more than 5.67 million people. During the October Revolution anniversary and Marshal Stalin's birthday last year, Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations throughout the country organized grand celebration activities and conducted in-depth propaganda among the broad masses about Soviet assistance to the Chinese revolution and Stalin's revolutionary theories. In order to integrate their propaganda work with practical work, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in many places have taken the initiative to cooperate with local work in various aspects to vigorously introduce relevant Soviet construction experiences. For example, the Lushun-Dalian Sino-Soviet Friendship Association introduced the Soviet collective contract experience when factories in Lushun-Dalian signed collective contracts, and the Liaodong Province Sino-Soviet Friendship Association mobilized members of the railway department to work hard to learn the Soviet railway responsibility system and the new road maintenance method. All these have played a good role in promoting practical work. Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various places have universally established Russian language night schools, Russian language classes, or Russian language broadcasting lectures according to the needs of the masses. People are very enthusiastic to participate in learning. For example, the Russian language broadcasting lecture jointly organized by the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branch and the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station has attracted more than 12,000 participants in Beijing alone. At present, learning Russian has formed a craze among Chinese intellectuals, which clearly shows the urgent desire of the Chinese people to learn from the Soviet people.

    At the beginning of this year, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various places have formulated new work plans, preparing to take the work further forward.

    各地工厂机关学校部队农村中苏友协迅速发展
    会员总数已达一百九十余万
    【新华社北京二十日电】各地中苏友好协会组织正日益发展，现已成为一个强大的群众性组织。据截至去年十二月底的不完全统计，各地已建立起的中苏友好协会分会及支分会已达一百五十多个，支会及分支会已达三千九百八十多个，会员总数已达一百九十余万人。该会会员不仅遍于各大中城市的工厂、机关、学校和驻军中，且许多县城及乡村亦已建立中苏友好协会的组织，例如热河省中苏友好协会分会所属的三万六千四百五十六名会员中，农民即占一半。中苏友好协会组织在中国各阶层人民中的迅速发展，表示着中苏人民友谊的进一步发展和巩固。
    各地中苏友好协会的活动内容极为广泛，其中包括出版书刊，举行座谈会、演讲会、展览会、街头宣传，放映苏联电影，开办俄文学习班等。所有这些活动，对于帮助中国人民认识苏联、学习苏联和加强中苏人民友谊，都获得极大效果。据统计，仅东北各地（包括旅大地区）中苏友好协会半年来所组织的报告会、座谈会、展览会等，即达五千八百三十次，放映苏联影片八百三十九部，参加这些活动的群众共达五百六十七万多人。在去年十月革命节及斯大林大元帅寿辰时，各地中苏友好协会都组织了盛大的庆祝活动，并向广大人民进行了关于苏联援助中国革命和斯大林革命学说的深入宣传。许多地方的中苏友好协会为使自己的宣传工作与实际工作相结合，曾主动地配合当地各方面工作大力介绍相关的苏联建设经验，如旅大中苏友好协会在旅大各工厂签订集体合同时介绍苏联集体合同经验，辽东省中苏友好协会发动铁路部门的会员努力学习苏联铁路负责制及新养路法等，都对实际工作起了很好的推动作用。各地中苏友好协会都依照群众要求普遍成立了俄文夜校、俄文学习班或俄语播音讲座，参加学习的人极为踊跃，例如北京中苏友好协会分会与北京人民广播电台合办的俄语播音讲座，仅北京市内参加学习的即达一万二千余人。目前学习俄语已在中国知识分子中间形成一个热潮，这件事清楚地说明了中国人民向苏联人民学习的迫切愿望。
    各地中苏友好协会于今年初多已拟订了新的工作计划，准备把工作更向前推进一步。
