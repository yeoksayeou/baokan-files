    Beijing News: The Beijing Municipal Government discussed the issue of production and thrift at an administrative meeting on the 13th and resolved to establish a Production and Thrift Committee.

Yesterday (the 14th), the Municipal Government convened a meeting of section chiefs and above from various bureaus, offices, and district public offices to deploy and discuss the issue of production and thrift. Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu first reported on the Beijing Municipal Government's work plan and budget estimates for this year, explaining the importance of production and the relationship between thrift and production. He pointed out that failure to vigorously practice thrift would hinder the completion of this year's primary task—the production task. Therefore, today's call for thrift is a significant political and principled matter. Following this, Secretary-General Xue Zizheng presented specific suggestions regarding production and thrift for everyone to discuss and enable swift action.

    【北京讯】京市政府十三日在行政会议上讨论生产节约问题，决议成立生产节约委员会，并推出薛子正、李公侠、彭城、晁锦文、王纯、翁独健、牟泽衔、贾星五、曲日新、王云和赵子尚等十一人为委员，薛子正为主任委员。昨（十四）日市政府又召集各局处和各区公所科长以上干部开会，布置与讨论生产节约问题。张友渔副市长首先在会上报告了北京市府今年的工作计划和收支概算，并说明生产的重要性和节约对于生产的关系。他指出如果不厉行节约，就会妨碍今年的首要任务——生产任务的完成，所以今天号召节约，这是一个很大的政治性、原则性的问题。接着，薛子正秘书长提出了关于生产节约的具体意见，供大家回去讨论，以便迅速行动起来。
