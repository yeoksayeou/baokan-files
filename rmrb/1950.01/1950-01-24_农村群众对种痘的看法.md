    Rural People's Views on Vaccination
    Zhi Liqiao
    The Shunyi County Epidemic Prevention Medical Team in Hebei Province, in order to carry out vaccination work in rural areas, vaccinated the masses in Yangzhen, Shishan and other areas. I participated in this work for nearly a month and learned about some rural people's understanding and views on vaccination. I am introducing them for the reference of comrades who are carrying out vaccination work in rural areas:
    (1) "Vaccinate after the peach blossoms bloom." The villagers attach great importance to "vaccination must be in the spring" and do not understand the benefits of vaccination in autumn and winter.
    (2) Most people believe that one vaccination protects them for a lifetime and there is no need to be vaccinated again. They do not understand the principle that vaccination only protects for three to five years.
    (3) People infected with smallpox have an incubation period of ten to fourteen days before smallpox is discovered. If they are vaccinated during this period, they will still develop smallpox. They seize on this kind of example and say: "I'm afraid that vaccination will cause smallpox," and they dare not get vaccinated.
    (4) They are afraid that they will not be able to work after vaccination and delay production. Therefore, it is necessary to explain repeatedly that it will not delay production. Even if it delays some production, it is much better to not get smallpox than to get sick with pockmarks or even die.
    (5) Due to the old rules of vaccination in the past, each person was vaccinated with three shots, and the knife was used to cut deeply to draw blood. They despise and reject our new method of vaccination, which only uses needles to lightly scratch the skin without causing bleeding, which is both labor-saving, economical, and effective.
    Therefore, to carry out vaccination work among the rural masses, it is first necessary to conduct persuasive and educational propaganda work among the masses based on their various ideological obstacles, so that vaccination work can be carried out well.

    农村群众对种痘的看法
    智力樵
    河北顺义县防疫医疗队，为了开展农村种痘工作，在杨镇、史山一带给群众种痘。我参加这个工作将近一个月的时间，了解一些农村群众对种痘的认识和看法，介绍出来供开展农村种痘工作的同志参考：
    （一）“桃树开花再种痘”。老乡们对“种痘必须在春天”，看得非常重要，不明白秋、冬种痘的好处。
    （二）大部分人认为种一次保一辈子，不必再种了，不懂得种痘只管三、五年的道理。
    （三）感染天花以后的人潜伏十至十四天，才发现天花，在这个期间种痘也要出天花，他们抓住这种例子就说是：“怕种痘引出花来”，不敢种痘。
    （四）怕种痘后不能劳动耽误生产，因此要再三说明不会耽误生产的，即使误些生产，不染天花要比害病生麻子甚而丧命强得多。
    （五）由于过去种痘的老规矩，每人种三颗，用刀划得很深流出血来。对于我们只用针轻划，不使出血，既省事又经济，效果又好的种痘新法，表示轻视拒绝。
    因此，在农村群众中进行种痘工作，首先便需根据群众的各种思想障碍，在群众中进行说服和教育的宣传工作，种痘工作才能很好的开展。
