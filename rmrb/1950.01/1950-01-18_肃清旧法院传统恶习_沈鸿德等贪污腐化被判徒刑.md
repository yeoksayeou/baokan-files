    Eradicating Malpractices Inherited from the Old Courts
    Shen Hongde and Others Sentenced to Imprisonment for Embezzlement and Corruption
    [Beijing News] Shen Hongde and Hao Ruixin, guards at the Detention Center of the Beijing Municipal People's Court, failed to change their old habits and engaged in embezzlement and corruption. After being discovered by the Detention Center, the case was reported to the court, and after a trial, they were sentenced to imprisonment. Shen Hongde had served as a guard in the detention center of the pseudo-Beijing Municipal District Court since 1947, and he became accustomed to the corrupt practices of the reactionary court. He had already embezzled several times during his tenure in the pseudo-court. After the liberation of Beijing, he was retained as a guard at the Beijing Municipal People's Court. Despite education and reform, he still did not change his old habits. From March or April to September of last year, he successively accepted bribes from the families of eleven prisoners, including Song Zhenchuan and Zhang Shihe. He also violated regulations by privately passing letters and items to prisoners, and he patronized prostitutes four times around March or April of last year. Hao Ruixin was originally a constable in the Procuratorate of the pseudo-Beiping Municipal District Court. After the liberation of Beijing, he was retained by the Beijing Municipal People's Court and transferred to serve as a guard at the Detention Center. Since August of last year, he was in charge of the Detention Center's food. In September, he embezzled 137,700 yuan of the Detention Center’s food expenses due to patronizing prostitutes, and falsely reported the loss of public funds. After the embezzlement and corrupt acts of Shen Hongde and Hao Ruixin were discovered by the Detention Center of the court, they were reported to the court on November 10th of last year. The court immediately detained Shen and Hao and brought them to justice. During their detention, Shen and Hao showed remorse after education and reflection. The court leniently sentenced them, allowing them to continue to reform. Shen Hongde was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, and Hao Ruixin was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment.
