Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 8th. TASS Moscow - Izvestia recently published an editorial entitled "Improving the Work of Soviet Administrative Organs," stating: The more attention is paid administratively to studying the activities of lower levels and striving to help them in their work, the more advanced personnel are rewarded for their work, and the more the mistakes of backward elements are corrected, thereby educating all personnel, the more successful the struggle to raise the level of work within various organs will be. Maintaining close contact with the working people and paying the utmost attention to every opinion raised by the lower levels regarding shortcomings in work is the best way to find and eliminate every error and shortcoming in the work of administrative organs. Izvestia emphasized: The supervision of Soviet administrative organs by the working masses has been, and still is, a living and abundant source for further improving our organs.

The editorial pointed out: The task of improving the work of administrative organs is not a short-term movement, but should be a matter of planned and systematic attention. Our Soviet administrative organs should always be able to fulfill the new tasks that the Party and the government put before Soviet society.

    【新华社北京八日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报顷以“健全苏维埃行政机关的工作”为题发表社论称：行政上越是注意研究下级的活动并在工作中设法帮助他们，越是奖励先进人员的工作并纠正落后分子的错误，从而教育全体人员，则在各个机关内提高工作水平的斗争就将越成功。与劳动人民保持密切的联系，对下层所提出的每一个关于工作中的缺点的意见，都予以最高度的注意，乃是找出并消灭行政机关工作中每一个错误与缺点的最好的方法。消息报强调称：劳动群众对苏维埃行政机关的监督，过去是而现在也是进一步健全我们的机关的活的丰富源泉。
    社论指出：健全行政机关工作的任务不是短期的运动，而应是有计划有系统地注意的事情。我们的苏维埃行政机关应该经常能够胜任党与政府在苏维埃社会面前所提出的新任务。
