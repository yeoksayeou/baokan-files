    Organized and Led Restoration of Agricultural Production
    East China Formulates This Year's Agricultural Plan
    Guaranteeing Completion of the Task Assigned by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government
    Increasing Grain Production by 3.2 Billion Jin and Expanding Cotton Fields by 15 Million Mu
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Department of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy of the East China Region, with reference to the different conditions of various provinces and regions, and in accordance with the resolutions of the First East China Regional Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Work Conference in November 1949 regarding the East China Region's 1950 Grain, Cotton, Hemp, and Peanut Production Increase Plan, Pest and Disease Prevention Plan, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Work Plan, and Agricultural Engineering Plan, has formally formulated the 1950 Agricultural Production Plan after revision and approval by the East China Financial and Economic Committee. This is to restore and develop agricultural production in various provinces and regions in an organized and led manner, and to guarantee the victorious completion of the task assigned by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government to increase grain production by 3.2 billion jin, expand cotton fields by 15.2 million mu, and produce 3,798,000 dan of ginned cotton.
    The plan pointed out that in terms of grain production increase, old areas are required to increase their output by 10% compared to the actual output in 1949, increasing grain production by 1.9 billion jin of raw grain. New areas are generally required to maintain the production level of 1949 (based on the output without disasters), but areas with better conditions should increase grain production by 1.3 billion jin of raw grain. For cotton production, old areas must reach 2.4 million dan of ginned cotton, and new areas must reach 1.3988 million dan. Other special products such as jute and peanuts must also be appropriately increased. Among them, Shandong Province will plant 109,566,669 mu of grain crops, increasing grain production by 1.4 billion jin; plant 6 million mu of cotton, with a total output of 1.56 million dan of ginned cotton; plant 40,000 mu of jute, producing 80,000 dan of raw jute; and plant 8 million mu of peanuts, with an output of 12 million dan. Northern Jiangsu will plant 47,751,860 mu of grain crops, increasing grain production by 500 million jin; plant 3.5 million mu of cotton, with a total output of 840,000 dan of ginned cotton; and plant 1,814,940 mu of peanuts, with an output of 3,629,880 dan. Southern Jiangsu will plant 30,711,176 mu of grain crops, increasing grain production by 400 million jin; and plant 3 million mu of cotton, with a total output of 720,000 dan of ginned cotton. Zhejiang Province will plant 45,368,324 mu of grain crops, increasing grain production by 570 million jin; plant 1.5 million mu of cotton, with a total output of 390,000 dan of ginned cotton; and plant 150,000 mu of jute, producing 600,000 dan of raw jute. Fujian Province will plant 24,571,937 mu of grain crops, increasing grain production by 100 million jin; and plant 846,553 mu of peanuts, with an output of 1,415,789 dan. Southern Anhui will plant 10,439,712 mu of grain crops, increasing grain production by 100 million jin; plant 200,000 mu of cotton, with a total output of 48,000 dan of ginned cotton; and plant 80,757 mu of peanuts, with an output of 121,130 dan. Northern Anhui will plant 61.16 million mu of grain crops, increasing production by 130 million jin, excluding the 7 million mu of wheat that was not planted due to floods. Plant 1 million mu of cotton, with a total output of 240,000 dan of ginned cotton; and plant 1 million mu of peanuts, with an output of 1 million dan.
    In order to achieve the above-mentioned production increase goals, in addition to vigorously preventing diseases, pests, and animal epidemics, agricultural implements should be greatly supplemented, mechanical irrigation and drainage should be promoted, mechanized farming should be promoted as a priority, and agricultural water conservancy projects should be vigorously carried out. The East China Region will invest a total of 54 million jin of rice in agricultural water conservancy, allocating 40 million jin to Shandong, 4 million jin to Southern Anhui, and 5 million jin each to Zhejiang and Southern Jiangsu, as the material basis for this work.
    Regarding the promotion of improved varieties, the main grain crops are wheat, rice, corn, sorghum, millet, soybeans, and sweet potatoes. A total of 2,000 tons of improved cotton varieties will be imported. After supplying 500 tons to the Central South Region, the remaining 1,500 tons (30,000 dan) will be distributed to Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu, and Zhejiang.

    有组织有领导地恢复农业生产
    华东订定今年农业计划
    保证完成中央人民政府农业部给予的任务
    增产粮食三十二亿斤扩大棉田千五百万亩
    【本报讯】华东区农林水利部参照各省区不同的条件，并依照一九四九年十一月间华东区第一次农林水利工作会议中关于一九五○年华东区粮、棉、麻、花生增产计划，病虫害防治计划，畜牧兽医工作计划，农业工程计划等决议，经华东区财委会修正批准，正式订定一九五○年农业生产计划，以便有组织有领导的恢复发展各省区农业生产，保证胜利完成中央人民政府农业部给予增产粮食三十二亿斤，扩大棉田一五二○万亩，生产皮棉三百七十九万八千市担的增产任务。
    该计划中指出在粮食增产方面，要求老地区较一九四九年当年产量提高一成，增产十九亿斤原粮。新地区一般要求维持一九四九年当年生产水平（按不受灾害的产量计），但在条件较好的地区增产十三亿斤原粮。棉产量，老区须达皮棉二百四十万市担，新区须达一百三十九万八千市担。其他黄麻、花生等特产亦须作适当的增产。其中山东省种植粮食作物一亿○九百五十六万六千六百六十九亩，增产粮食十四亿斤，种植棉花六百万亩，总产量皮棉一百五十六万市担。种植黄麻四万亩，产原麻八万市担。种植花生八百万亩，产量须达一千二百万市担。苏北区种植粮食作物四千七百七十五万一千八百六十亩，增产粮食五亿斤。种植棉花三百五十万亩，总产量皮棉八十四万市担。种植花生一百八十一万四千九百四十亩，产量须达三百六十二万九千八百八十市担。苏南区种植粮食作物三千○七十一万一千一百七十六亩，增产粮食四亿斤。种植棉花三百万亩，总产量皮棉七十二万市担。浙江省种植粮食作物四千五百三十六万八千三百二十四亩，增产粮食五亿七千万斤，种植棉花一百五十万亩，总产量皮棉三十九万市担。种植黄麻十五万亩，产原麻六十万市担。福建省种植粮食作物二千四百五十七万一千九百三十七亩增产粮食一亿斤，种植花生八十四万六千五百五十三亩，产量须达一百四十一万五千七百八十九市担，皖南区种植粮食作物一千○四十三万九千七百十二亩，增产粮食一亿斤，种植棉花二十万亩总产量皮棉四万八千市担。种植花生八万零七百五十七亩，产量须达十二万一千一百三十市担。皖北区种植粮食作物六千一百十六万亩，除去因水灾关系少播种小麦七百万亩产量外，两地增产一亿三千万斤。种植棉花一百万亩，总产量皮棉二十四万市担。种植花生一百万亩，产量须达一百万市担。
    为了达到上述增产目的，除了大力进行防止病害虫及兽疫外，应大量补充农具，推行机械灌溉和排水，重点推行机耕，大力举办农田水利工程。华东区对农田水利投资共大米五千四百万斤，分配予山东四千万斤，皖南四百万斤，浙江苏南各五百万斤，以为此项工作的物资基础。
    关于推广优良品种，粮食作物以小麦、水稻、玉米、高粱、小米、大豆、地瓜为主。棉花优良品种共输入二千吨。除供给中南区五百吨外，余一千五百吨（三万担）分配山东、苏北、苏南、浙江。
