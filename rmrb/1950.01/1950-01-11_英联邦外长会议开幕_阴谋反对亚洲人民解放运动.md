    Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference Opens
    Plotting Against the Liberation Movement of the Asian People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th] The British Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference officially began on the 9th in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon. Participants included the foreign ministers and representatives of Britain, Canada, Australia, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, and South Africa. According to a Reuters report, the first meeting was presided over by Ceylon's Prime Minister Senanayake. The following six main items on the agenda of the conference were released on the afternoon of the 9th: 1. The European political situation related to the British Commonwealth; 2. Economic problems in Southeast Asia; 3. The problem of preventing the so-called "expansion of Communism in Southeast Asia"; 4. The Japanese peace treaty; 5. The problem of the so-called "expansion of the situation of the Communist Party in China"; 6. Defense issues in Southeast Asia. These agendas show that the British imperialist group is actively planning new measures in the political, military, and economic fields to oppose the liberation movements of the people of Southeast Asia in order to maintain their colonial rule and interests in various parts of Southeast Asia.
