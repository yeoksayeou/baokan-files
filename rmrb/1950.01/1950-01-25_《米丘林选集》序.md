    Preface to "Selected Works of Michurin"
    By Soviet Academician P. N. Yakovlev
    Translated by Shu Yishang

    The great Soviet biologist Michurin (1855-1935) was the creator of the new materialist biology. His doctrine is not only important in general biology, but also makes great contributions to various departments of biology, such as horticulture, animal husbandry, medical botany, physiology, and ecology. This selection is the great crystallization of his sixty years of brilliant career. His works are popular throughout the Soviet Union and are highly praised by the new scientific community around the world. The Translation Bureau of the General Administration of Publications has now commissioned agricultural biology experts from the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute to collectively translate this selection. It is expected that all drafts will be completed in mid-February and published by Xinhua Bookstore.
            "Mankind Can and Should Transform Nature"
    The famous Soviet scientist Michurin (J.V. Michurin) in the field of biology is known all over the world. He is a brave scientific revolutionary, an indomitable researcher, and a great transformer of nature. He enjoys great fame and is respected in the victorious socialist country of the Soviet Union because in the Soviet Union, science has every opportunity for glorious development, so the creative genius of this great Soviet scientist can be fully exerted.

    Michurin laid the foundation of the new materialist biology. His science is the study of the development and control of organisms. The general theory about the development of organisms and their transformation in a fixed direction is the basic core of materialist biology. The basic elements of Michurin's doctrine lie in the principles and methods of research, as well as the dialectical materialist view of the evolutionary process of the animal and plant kingdoms. Precisely because of this, Michurin's doctrine is not only important in general biology, but also equally important in all departments of biology (such as horticulture, animal husbandry, medical botany, physiology, ecology, etc.).

    The principles of Michurin's theory are irrefutable. Its correctness lies in the fact that these principles are not based on simple reasoning or abstract deduction (like formal geneticists), but on many facts derived from life and practical observation. The establishment of these principles is the result of his many years of hard work and persistent struggle to master the many laws of the biological world. With the loyalty and genius of a scientist and the insight of a naturalist, Michurin went step by step into the mysteries of nature and skillfully discovered them.

    In his scientific research, Michurin always kept in mind Engels's viewpoint in dialectics: "...nothing is finite, absolute, or sacred. It shows that nothing is static, whether internal or external; nothing can persist before it except the continuous process of occurrence and death, and the endless process of rising from the lower to the higher." When citing Engels's most important teachings, Michurin said:

    "This principle has been the basic principle of all my work in the past and present. When improving many existing varieties and creating new varieties of fruit and berry plants, I have always focused on this principle in many experiments."

    Occasionally, there are many scientists who have no real achievements in theory or practice "...believe that the plant organisms existing on the surface of the earth are immutable, and say that humans cannot transform nature, but I think that all differences in plant morphology originate from a very small number of plants, which are originally due to the infinite changes in nature, and I will further present many facts to prove that mankind can and should transform nature..." (Michurin).
            Raising Materialist Biology to a New Stage
    Michurin's doctrine starts from this basic principle: the new properties acquired by plants and animals due to the influence of external living conditions can be inherited by future generations. That is to say, the qualitative changes in the nature of plant and animal organisms are always determined by living conditions.

    Therefore, the key point of Michurin's doctrine is not what the representatives of bourgeois formal genetics deliberately distort and erroneously assert as hybridization (Note 1). The key point, the basic principle, of Michurin's doctrine is the role of the environment and the purposeful cultivation of hybrids.

    Michurin believes that hybridization is only the source of variation, but it is necessary to properly select parents so that the hybrid can obtain new and desired properties.

    Michurin repeatedly pointed out that the work of a breeder is endless and only begins when hybrid seeds are obtained. The young organisms resulting from the mating of the initial two parents have significant unstable heredity and therefore have great plasticity. Applying Michurin's various cultivation methods, it is possible to change such an organism in the direction expected by the breeder.

    Michurin pointed out that if inappropriate cultivation methods are applied, completely wild plants may be obtained from the hybrids of the best cultivated varieties; conversely, if the required cultivation methods are applied, we may obtain a good new variety from a hybrid seedling with inferior traits. Michurin emphasized: "In short, the formation of hybrids depends on the parents by only one-tenth, while the environment accounts for nine-tenths."

    Darwin discovered the law of development of the organic world and established the correct concept of the evolution of biological organisms. However, he failed to point out how to control evolution in order to create new plants beneficial to mankind. This task fell on Michurin's shoulders.

    In order to develop the positive aspects of Darwin's doctrine, Michurin raised materialist biology to a new and higher stage, thus laying the foundation for Soviet, creative Darwinism.

    Early in his work, Michurin completely refuted the false theory of the famous horticulturalist Grell through many experiments. According to Grell, old plant varieties that have borne fruit many times in the south can be transplanted to northern regions to domesticate them.

    Based on many experiments, Michurin proved that domestication of plants is indeed possible, but "...it is limited to planting seeds. Generally, if foreign varieties cannot tolerate the lowest temperature of the new region in their native environment, they cannot be domesticated by transplanting the entire plant, grafting, layering, etc."

    Michurin here for the first time announced a theoretical principle. The nature of a variety begins to form from the first day of seed development; and during this period, it can be most easily changed in the desired direction according to the conditions of cultivation.

    Michurin's long and persistent efforts to extend the cultivation of fruit trees to the far north led him to apply hybridization methods, crossing various plants that were geographically distant, followed by targeted cultivation of hybrid seedlings. The farther the plants he used for hybridization were from their native land, the more perfectly the excellent properties of the two parents were combined in those hybrids, and the easier such hybrids were to adapt to the harsh environment of the central zone of the Soviet Union (i.e., Michurin's workplace).

    Michurin created most of his standard varieties by hybridizing some geographically distant plant races. Almost every variety he cultivated can fully prove that his theory is correct, saying that organisms, especially young hybrid organisms, will undergo tremendous changes under the influence of external conditions.
            Exposure of Idealist Biology
    Among Michurin's many great discoveries, there is a principle that has been fully proven, that is, the variations in organisms caused by either sexual or asexual growth methods are controlled by the same laws, and sex cells and somatic cells are in principle no different. Michurin proved this very important principle through his many experiments and studies on nutritional hybrids of plants.

    Michurin pointed out that sex cells are formed from the somatic cells that make up the entire organism at a certain stage of organism development. Therefore, there is a very close interaction between somatic cells and sex cells.

    By means of asexual hybridization (Note 2), Michurin created fruit tree varieties with excellent qualities. In addition, he also created some other excellent varieties by means of sexual hybridization. All these varieties are now regarded as standard varieties and are propagated in most regions and provinces of the Soviet Union.

    Asexual hybrids (Note 3) provide undeniable facts to explain the most important property of organisms—that is, their heredity. Controlling environmental conditions is sufficient to improve and create new varieties with the heredity we need in the desired direction.

    Michurin profoundly studied the theory of development based on the historical process of organisms and the interaction of their heredity. He believed that organisms and the environment are integral and inseparable. Michurin believed that external conditions play a decisive role in the formation of organisms. Michurin once wrote: "It seems that some people who think they are experts in the laws of the plant kingdom childishly doubt my saying that the environment has an influence on the formation of new species and new varieties, and argue that it has not been scientifically proven."

    "...First of all, we need to know, we must ask them whether they truly believe that the 300,000 plant species are all produced solely by the inheritance of parental properties. (There is no influence in the environment)... Strange, such a conclusion would be completely unreasonable. If we say that the plant kingdom currently living on the earth all originated from the initial individual plant organisms, and they have undergone tens of millions of years of hybridization and fertilization, and the environmental conditions that have changed very frequently and greatly in the past tens of millions of years have no influence on them, it is indeed incomprehensible."

    Michurin deepened and developed Darwinism. Therefore, his doctrine has played a huge role, both in the past and present, in exposing the anti-scientific nature of the various reactionary idealist theories advocated by the enemies of materialist biology.

    For many years, the reactionary tendency of idealist Weismannism (Mendelism, Morganism) has continued to occupy a position of power in biological science.

    The struggle against this anti-scientific tendency is carried out in the only correct direction—Michurin's materialist direction.

    A sharp struggle that divides biologists into two irreconcilable camps arises around the old and basic point of contention: that is, can plant and animal organisms inherit the characteristics and properties they acquire in life? In other words, does the qualitative change in the nature of plant or animal organisms depend on various living conditions, that is, on the environment that affects it?

    Michurin's materialist dialectical biology cites many facts to affirm such a relationship. Weismann (Mendel, Morgan) idealist, metaphysical biology completely denies such a relationship, but does not produce any evidence.

    In August 1948, the Soviet Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences held a meeting in Moscow to discuss the current situation of biological science. At this meeting, all aspects of Weismann's (Mendel, Morgan's) direction in the biological community were completely exposed, ideologically thoroughly overthrown, and denounced as anti-scientific, reactionary, idealist, metaphysical, and separated from life and useless in practice. It is the opposite of Michurin's direction because Michurin's direction is the creative development of Darwin's doctrine and a new higher stage in the development of materialist biology. "The main theme of this discussion is Michurin's famous motto: 'We cannot wait for the favors of nature, we must seize those favors from nature.' Michurin's instruction may be said to contain the spirit of Bolshevism, not only calling on scientific workers, but also calling on millions of farmers to actively engage in creative work for the benefit and glory of our people" (Molotov).
            Lenin's and Stalin's Concern and Support
    Michurin's doctrine—the world's only progressive biology—has developed and grown in the victorious socialist land of the Soviet Union. That is by no means accidental. Academician Lysenko said: "Michurin's doctrine is inseparable from the practical activities of collective farms and state farms. It is one of the best forms of combining theory and practice in agricultural science."

    Michurin himself wrote: If there had been no Soviet system, he might have become "a silent hermit of experimental horticulture in Tsarist Russia."

    Recalling the pre-revolutionary era, Michurin wrote: "My entire road before the revolution was strewn with ridicule, neglect, and burying."

    "Before the revolution, I used to repeatedly suffer from the criticism and insults of ignorant people, who declared that all my work was useless, just 'fantasy' and 'nonsense'. Officials sent by the Ministry of Agriculture shouted at me: 'How dare you do this!' Scientists from the officialdom declared that the hybrids I cultivated were 'illegitimate children.' Clergymen threatened me: 'Don't do blasphemous things! Don't turn God's garden into a brothel!' (That's how they described my hybridization method)."

    Michurin ignored everything and persisted to the end, determined to achieve his goal. He was a loyal patriot and an enthusiastic innovator, and he wholeheartedly dedicated himself to serving his people. "I strove to achieve the goals I had set," Michurin later wrote, "but I had no tools, no established position, was completely isolated, and constantly struggled with poverty and darkness. I used meager resources to engage in hard and at that time absolutely unrewarded scientific work. I could only earn money through my personal labor, serving as a railway clerk and a fine mechanic."

    The U.S. Department of Agriculture, between 1911 and 1913, knowing about Michurin's outstanding work and economic difficulties, repeatedly suggested that he go to the United States, or at least let him sell all the varieties he had collected, the new varieties he had created, and the hybrids, of course with generous remuneration. However, Michurin refused to accept it every time. He believed that his many achievements and collections should not be used to enrich capitalists, but should only become the property of the people.

    The first to pay attention to Michurin's work was Lenin. In the first few months of its establishment, the Soviet government, without considering that the civil war was raging and the national economy was in difficulty, gave Michurin the necessary subsidies. The nursery he set up in Kozlov (now renamed Michurinsk) was visited twice by Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee.

    Later, in 1928, some fully equipped laboratories were built in Michurin's nursery. This nursery was later reorganized into a selection and genetics station, and then, in 1931, it was transformed into the Michurin Central Genetics Laboratory.

    For his outstanding achievements in creating new plant varieties, the Soviet government awarded Michurin the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labor. In 1932, the city of Kozlov, where Michurin had lived and worked, was renamed Michurinsk by a resolution of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union.

    Since Michurinsk became the largest scientific research center, transforming organisms, it has become the largest dissemination center, disseminating the ideas of Michurin biology, and establishing progressive Soviet agricultural biology. When painfully recalling the difficult life and work in the Tsarist era, Michurin said: "...Only under the Soviet system was I recognized by my country. The first person to pay attention to my work was Lenin."

    "I am now receiving the concern and attention of the party led by Stalin, and I have the opportunity to work and can even more effectively engage in the great work of transforming the earth."

    On the eve of the 60th anniversary of his scientific activities, Michurin wrote a letter to Comrade Stalin, in which he summarized the help given to him by the Party and the government.

    In that letter, Michurin wrote: "That small garden that I established sixty years ago for cultivating new varieties of fruit trees and creating new plant organisms has now been transformed by the Soviet government into the All-Soviet center for industrial fruit tree breeding and scientific plant breeding, with thousands of hectares of orchards, and magnificent laboratories and equipment, and dozens of very talented researchers. …

    "I myself was originally a lonely experimenter, neither recognized nor ridiculed by officials of the Tsarist Ministry of Agriculture. Now, the Soviet government and the Party led by you have long made me the leader and organizer of hundreds of thousands of plant experiments.

    "The Communist Party and the working class have now given me everything I need—everything an experimenter expects for his work."

    Michurin was particularly moved by the warm telegram of congratulations sent by Stalin on the 60th anniversary of his scientific activities. The original telegram read as follows:

    "Congratulations on the 60th anniversary of your productive labor for the benefit of our great motherland, Ivan Vladimirovich (Note 4).

    I wish you good health and new achievements in the work of transforming fruit trees.

    I shake your hand warmly. Joseph Stalin."
            Great Achievements of Michurin's Doctrine
    Michurin's doctrine has now produced remarkable results.

    First of all, Michurin himself created about 300 new varieties of fruit trees and berries. But his contribution is not limited to this. He also extended the famous Humboldt Zone far to the north. He enabled many plants to grow and bear fruit in vast areas where, in his time not long ago, people never dreamed of seeing fruit trees laden with fruit; such as grapes in Chelyabinsk, apricots in Siberia, and pears in the Altai Mountains. Like a myth, Michurin sowed many orchards across vast areas of the Soviet Union, greened many mountains, and decorated them with many varieties never seen before.

    But his contribution is not limited to this.

    There are no fewer than a million successors to Michurin's doctrine, forming a powerful army. This is the most valuable asset created by this transformer of nature. They are now enjoying the legacy that Michurin passed on to them. They all wear the shining badge of honor—the Medal of Socialist Labor Hero. In the Soviet socialist country, their labor is respected and praised.

    The resolution of the August 1948 meeting of the Soviet Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences recorded the great and fruitful work of Academician Lysenko, Chairman of the Academy, because he led Soviet biologists in the ideological overthrow of Mendel, Morganism, and he raised the banner of Michurin's materialist biology. Academician Lysenko is victoriously and fruitfully developing Michurin's doctrine. He is studying the most profound theoretical problems of modern biology, and is also providing clear examples to solve the practical problems that occur in agriculture. After profoundly studying the theory of plant stage development, Lysenko, based on this theory, invented a valuable agronomic method, which is the famous vernalization method, which is now being practically applied on millions of hectares of land. Among other agronomic methods created by Lysenko are sowing winter crops on stubble land in Siberia, planting potatoes in summer in the southern region, dense planting of rubber grass and forest land, wide-row sowing of millet, and topping of cotton. "...The future belongs to Michurin," Academician Lysenko said in conclusion when reporting at the meeting of the Soviet Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences: "Lenin and Stalin discovered Michurin and made his doctrine the property of the Soviet people. Their two paternal great concern for his work has saved this outstanding Michurin doctrine for biology. The Party and the government, as well as Stalin, are constantly concerned about the future development of Michurin's doctrine. The most glorious task of us Soviet biologists is to actively develop Michurin's doctrine and implement the Michurin style in all our activities to study the nature of biological development."

    《米丘林选集》序
    苏联院士  Ｐ·Ｎ·雅可夫列夫作
    舒贻上译
    苏联大生物学家米丘林（一八五五——一九三五年）是唯物论新生物学的创造者。他的学说，不仅在普通生物学上是重要的，并且对于生物学的各个部门，如园艺学、畜牧学、医物学、生理学、生态学等，也都有极大的贡献。这本选集，是他六十年光辉事业的伟大结晶。他的著作，风行苏联全国，并且受到全世界新科学界的一致推崇。出版总署翻译局现已约请华北农业科学研究所农业生物专家集体翻译这本选集，预计二月中旬即可全部脱稿，由新华书店出版。
            “人类能够而且应该改造自然”
    在生物学界著名的苏联科学家米丘林（J.V.michurin），是举世皆知的。他是一个勇敢的科学革命者、不屈不挠的研究者、和伟大的自然改造者。他在苏联这个胜利的社会主义国家里，尤享盛名，并受人尊敬，因为在苏联，科学有着一切光荣发展的机会，所以这位伟大苏联科学家的创造天才，就能够充分地发挥出来。
    米丘林奠定了唯物论新生物学的基础，他的科学是研究生物的发育和控制。关于生物的发育及其依照所定方向的改造的一般理论，就是唯物论生物学的基本核心。米丘林学说的基本要素，在于研究的原理和方法，以及关于动植物界进化过程的辩证唯物论的观点。正因为这样，所以米丘林学说，不仅在普通生物学上是重要的，而且在生物学的各个部门（如园艺学，畜牧学，医物学，生理学，生态学等）都是同样重要的。
    米丘林理论的原理，都是无可反驳的，它之所以正确，是因为这些原理并非根据单纯的推理或抽象的演绎（像形式的遗传学者们那样），却是根据从生活，从实际观察得来的许多事实。这些原理的建立，都是他多年不辞辛劳，为着精通生物界的许多法则而持久奋斗的结果。米丘林凭着科学家的忠诚和天才与自然学家的洞察力，一步一步地深入到自然界的奥妙里去，并且巧妙地把它们发现出来。
    在他的科学研究工作里，米丘林始终牢记着恩格斯在辩证法里的观点：“………没有什么事物是有尽的、绝对的、神圣的。它表明一切事物的内在与外在都不是静止不动的；除开发生和死亡的连续过程，以及从低级向高级的无止境上升过程之外，没有什么其他现象能够在它面前持久存在的。”当引证恩格斯的最重要的教训时，米丘林说：
    “这个原理不论过去或现在都是我全部工作的基本原理，当改良许多现存品种以及创造水果和浆果植物的新品种时，我所做的许多实验，一直注重这个原理。”
    偶尔，有许多对理论或对实际没有确实成就的科学家“……认为存在于地球表面的植物有机体是不变的，又说人不能改造自然，但是我认为一切植物形态的差异，起源于极少数植物，原系由于自然界所发生的无穷变化过程的结果，并且我还要进而提出许多事实，来证明人类能够而且应该改造自然……”（米丘林）。
            把唯物论的生物学提高到一个新的阶段
    米丘林的学说，是从这个基本原理出发：大凡植物和动物因受外界的生活条件影响而得来的新性质都可以遗传给后代。这就是说，植物和动物有机体本性所发生的质变，总是决定于生活条件的。
    因此，米丘林学说的要点，并不像资产阶级形式遗传学的代表们故意歪曲地和错误地武断为杂交（注一）。米丘林学说的要点、基本的原理，就是环境所起的作用，以及有目标地培养杂种。
    米丘林认定杂交不过是变异的根源，但需要适当地选择亲本，以便使杂种获得新的和所希望的性质。
    米丘林屡次指出，一个育种者的工作是无止境的，当得到杂交种子时，才算开始。由最初的两亲体的交配结果所得的幼小有机体，具有显著不稳定的遗传性，因而就具有巨大的可塑性。应用米丘林各式各样的培养方法，就可能随着育种者所期望的方向，来改变像这样的一种有机体。
    米丘林曾指出，如果应用不适当的培养方法，从最好的栽培品种的杂种，或许可以得到完全的野生植物；反之，如果应用所需要的培养方法，我们或许可以从一种具有劣性的杂种幼苗，得到一种好的新品种。米丘林强调地说：“总而言之，杂种的形成，依靠双亲者不过十分之一，依靠环境者却占十分之九。”
    达尔文发现了有机界的发展法则，并且建立了生物有机体之进化的正确概念。可是，他未能指出要怎样控制进化才可以创造有利于人类的新的植物。这个工作就负在米丘林的肩上了。
    为着要发展达尔文学说的积极方面，米丘林就把唯物论的生物学提高到一个新的更高阶段，因而，为苏维埃的、创造的达尔文主义奠定了基础。
    早在他的工作的初期阶段，米丘林就凭许多实验，把著名园艺学家格列尔（Grell）的虚伪理论，完全驳翻。若依照格列尔所说，南方的已结果实多次的老植物品种，可以移植到较北的地区使它驯化。
    米丘林根据多次实验，证明植物的驯化诚然是可能的，但是“………只限于种植种子。大凡外来的品种如果在其本土环境里未能忍耐像新地区的最低温度，就不能用移植整个植株，抒枝，压条等方法来驯化。”
    米丘林在这里初次宣布了一个理论的原理。一个品种的本性，从种子发育的第一天，就开始形成；并且在这期间，它能够依照栽培的条件，循着所期望的方向，最容易改变。
    米丘林长久而坚持的努力，以求向极北地区伸延栽培果树的改良方法，这使他应用了杂交方法，把地理上距离远的各种植物杂交起来，跟着就对杂种的苗木加以有目标的培养。他所找来用作杂交的植物，离其本土越远，两亲体的优良性质在那些杂种里结合得越完善，并且这样的杂种就越容易适应苏联中央地带的严酷环境（即米丘林的工作地点）。
    米丘林便是用一些地理上远距离的植物种族，施以杂交，而创造了他的标准品种的大多数。差不多每一个由他培育出来的品种，都可以充分证明他的学说是对的，他说生物尤其幼小的杂种有机体，都会在外界条件的影响下，发生巨大的变化。
            对唯心论生物学的揭露
    在米丘林许多伟大发现中，有一个已经完全证明了的原理，即不论是用有性生殖的或无性生殖的生长方法而引起的有机体变异，皆为同样的规律所控制，并且性细胞和体细胞在原则上是无差别的。米丘林凭着他关于植物营养杂种的许多实验和研究证明了这个很重要的原理。
    米丘林指出，性细胞都是在有机体发育的一定阶段中，从那些构成整个有机体的体细胞形成的。因此，在体细胞和性细胞之间有一种极密切的相互作用。
    凭着无性杂交法（注二），米丘林创造了一些优良品质的果树品种。此外他还凭着有性杂交法创造了一些其他优良品种，现在所有这些品种在苏联大部分地区和省份，都被视为标准品种而繁殖着。
    无性杂种（注三）提供了不容置辩的事实来解释，有机体的极重要性质——即其遗传性。控制环境的条件，足以按照所期望的方向去改善并创造具有我们所需要的遗传性的新品种。
    米丘林根据有机体的历史过程和其遗传性的相互作用，潜心地研究出发展的学说。他认为有机体和环境是有整体而不可分离的关系。米丘林认为外界条件对于有机体的形成，是有决定作用的。米丘林曾经写过：“似乎是这样，有些人们自己以为是精通植物界诸法则的专家，幼稚地怀疑我所说环境对于新种和新品种所形成的影响，并强辩它还未经科学上的证明。”
    “……首先需要想知道的，就是要问他们是否真实相信三十万个植物种类都是单由亲体性质的遗传而产生的。（在环境方面没有任何影响）……奇怪，这样一个结论，竟会全不合理。如果说现时地球上所生存的植物界全是起源于最初的个别植物有机体，它们经过了几千万年的杂交受精，而过去几千万年间变化很经常很大的环境条件对于他们却没有影响，这诚然是费解的。”
    米丘林加深了和发展了达尔文主义，因此他的学说，在暴露唯物主义生物学的敌人所倡导的种种反动唯心主义理论所含的反科学性质中，不论过去和现在，都起了巨大的作用。
    许多年间，魏斯曼主义（孟德尔主义、摩尔根主义）的唯心论的反动倾向，曾经在生物科学内继续占有势力。
    对此反科学倾向的斗争，就是由那唯一正确的方向——米丘林的唯物论的方向。
    一种使生物学者分做两个不可调和的阵营的尖锐斗争，就围绕着那旧的和基本的争点而起了：就是说，植物和动物有机体能否遗传它们在生活中所获得的特征和特性？换句话说，植物或动物有机体的本性所发生的质变是不是要依靠种种的生活条件，即依靠影响于它的环境？
    米丘林唯物论辩证法的生物学，引证了许多事实来肯定这样的关系。魏斯曼（孟德尔，摩尔根）唯心论，形而上的生物学却彻底地否定了这样的关系，但并没有引出什么证据来。
    一九四八年八月，苏联列宁农业科学院在莫斯科举行会议，讨论过生物科学的现状。在这次会议里，生物学界中所有魏斯曼（孟德尔，摩尔根）方向，完全被揭露了，在思想上被彻底地推翻了，并且被斥为反科学的、反动的、唯心论的、形而上的，和生活分离而于实际无益的。它和米丘林方向相反，因为米丘林的方向是达尔文学说的创造性的发展，并且是唯物论生物学的发展上的一个新的较高阶段。“这次讨论的主旨就是米丘林的有名格言：‘我们不能等待着自然的恩惠，我们必须从自然攫取那些恩惠。’米丘林的这个指示，或许可说是含有布尔塞维克的精神，不仅号召科学工作者们、而且号召千百万的农民们，积极从事于创造性的工作，为我国人民谋利益和光荣”（莫洛托夫）。
            列宁和斯大林的关切和支持
    米丘林的学说—世界上唯一进步的生物学——已经在苏联这个胜利的社会主义的国土上发展而且壮大了。那决不是偶然的。李森科院士说过：“米丘林的学说，是和集体农庄及国营农场的实际活动不可分离的。它是农业科学中理论和实际结合的一个最好的形式。”
    米丘林自己写过：假使没有苏维埃制度，他或许会成了“一个在帝俄时代无声无息的实验园艺的隐士。”
    回忆革命前的时代，米丘林写过：“在革命以前我的全部道路上撒满了嘲笑、忽视和埋没。”
    “在革命以前，我惯于屡次受着无知之辈的批评和侮辱，他们宣称所有我的工作都是无用的，都只是‘幻想’和‘胡闹’。农业部派来的官员对我嚷着：‘你胆敢干这个！’官署的科学家们宣称我培育的杂种是‘私生子。’僧侣威吓我：‘不要做亵渎神明的事！不要把神的花园变为妓院！’（那就是他们对我的杂交法的形容）。”
    米丘林却不顾一切，仍旧坚持到底，定要实现他的目的。他是一个忠诚的爱国者，又是一个热心的革新家，他全然献身为他的人民服务。“我努力以求达成我所树立的目的，”米丘林后来写过：“不过我却没有工具，没有既成的地位，完全孤立着，并且不断和贫困及黑暗斗争，我利用着贫乏的物资，从事于辛苦的而在那时候绝对没有报酬的科学工作，我只能够靠着我个人的劳力来挣钱，充当一个铁路书记兼精细机械工人。”
    美国的农业部，在一九一一至一九一三年之间，因为知道了米丘林的杰出工作和经济困难情形，曾再三建议他到美国去，否则至少让他把所搜集的品种，新创造的品种和杂种，全部出卖，当然是报酬优厚。可是，米丘林每次都不肯接受。他认为他的许多成就和搜集不应当供资本家致富，只应当成为人民的财产。
    对米丘林的工作首先注意的就是列宁。苏维埃政府在它成立初期的几个月内，并不考虑内战正烈并且国家经济正在困难之中，就给了米丘林必需的补助。他在科兹罗夫（现已改称米丘林斯克）所设的苗圃曾经中央执行委员会主席加里宁去参观过两次。
    后来，在一九二八年，就在米丘林的苗圃里建设了些设备完全的实验室。这苗圃后来改组为选种和遗传站，再后，到一九三一年改成了米丘林中央遗传学实验室。
    为着他在创造植物新品种上有杰出的功绩，苏维埃政府对米丘林授与了列宁勋章和劳动红旗勋章。一九三二年，米丘林曾经住在那里工作过的科兹罗夫城，经由苏联中央执行委员会的常务委员会决议，改名为米丘林斯克。
    自从米丘林斯克成为最大的科学研究中心，改造生物以来，就成了最大的传播中心，传播米丘林生物学的思想，建立进步的苏维埃农业生物学。当其沉痛地回忆到在帝俄时代的艰难生活和工作时，米丘林说过：“……只有在苏维埃制度之下，我才被我的国家所认识，首先注意我工作的人就是列宁。”
    “我现在受着斯大林所领导的党的关切和注意，我得到了工作机会，甚至可以更有效率地去从事改造地球的伟大工作。”
    在他的科学活动六十周年的前夕，米丘林写了一封信给斯大林同志，在那信内他总结了党和政府所给他的帮助。
    米丘林在那封信里写着：“我六十年前为着培育新的果木品种并创造新的植物有机体所建立的那个狭小花园，现在业经苏维埃政府改造为全苏的工业化果树育种和科学植物育种的中心，内有几千公顷的果园，和宏壮的实验室与设备，并有几十个很有才能的研究员。……
    “我自己原是个孤独的实验者，既没有被帝俄农业部的官员所认识，还要受他们的讥诮，现在你所领导的苏维埃政府和党早已使我成为几十万种植物实验的指导者和组织者了。
    “共产党和工人阶级现已给我所需要的一切——一个实验者为他的工作所期望的一切。”
    米丘林特别受了那封温情电报的感动，那是在他的科学活动六十周年由斯大林拍来的贺电。原电内容如次：
    “欣逢你，伊万·乌拉吉米洛维奇（注四），为我们伟大祖国的福利，生产劳动的六十周年纪念，谨电致贺。
    祝你健康及改造果树工作有新成就。
    我热情地和你握手。约瑟夫·斯大林。”
            米丘林学说的伟大成果
    米丘林的学说现已产生卓越的成果。
    首先，米丘林自己就创造了大约三百种果树和浆果的新品种。然而他的贡献还不止此，他又把著名的洪波德地带（Humboldt Zone）远向北方推展。他使许多植物能在广大地区生长并结果实，那些地区内在他的时代不久以前，人从未梦想过可以看到结果累累的果树；例如葡萄在捷利亚宾斯克（Chelyahinsk），杏在西伯利亚，梨在阿尔泰山区。像神话一样，米丘林在苏联的大片面积上撒播了许多果园，绿化了许多山地，并且装饰了从未见过的许多品种。
    然而他的贡献又还不止此。
    米丘林学说的继承者，已不下百万人，组成了一支强大的队伍，这就是这个自然改造者所创造的最宝贵的资本。他们现在正享有着米丘林所传给他们的遗产。他们都佩带着辉耀灿烂的光荣标帜——社会主义者劳动英雄的勋章，在苏维埃社会主义国家里，他们的劳动是受到尊崇和赞美的。
    一九四八年八月苏联列宁农业科学院会议的决议，将该院主席李森科院士伟大而有成果的工作付诸记录了，因为他领导苏联生物科学者在思想上推翻孟德尔，摩尔根主义的斗争，并且他举起了米丘林唯物论生物学的旗帜。李森科院士正在胜利地有成果地发展米丘林的学说。他正研究现代生物学的最深奥的理论问题，同时也正在提供一些明显事例来解决农业上所发生的实际问题。像这样，把植物的阶段发育理论潜心地研究之后，李森科根据这个理论已发明一种有价值的农艺方法，这即是有名的春化法，现正在几百万公顷的土地上实际应用着。在其他农艺方法中间，由李森科创造出来的，还有在西伯利亚留茬地播种冬季作物，在南方区域夏季栽种马铃薯，橡胶草和森林地带的密植，粟的宽垅播种，以及棉花的摘心等项。“……将来是属于米丘林的”，院士李森科当他在苏联列宁农业科学院会议报告时，在结论里说：“列宁和斯大林发现了米丘林，并把他的学说成为苏联人民的财产。他们两位对其工作慈父般的巨大关怀，替生物学拯救了这个卓越的米丘林学说。党和政府以及斯大林，都经常关心着米丘林学说的今后发展。我们苏联生物学者最光荣的任务，就是积极地发展米丘林学说，并把米丘林作风，贯彻到我们研究生物发展本性的一切活动中去。”
