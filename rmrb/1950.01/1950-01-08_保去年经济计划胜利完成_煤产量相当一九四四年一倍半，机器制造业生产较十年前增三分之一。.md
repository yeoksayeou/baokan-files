Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: TASS, Sofia, dispatch: The working people of Bulgaria have victoriously concluded the economic year of 1949—the first year of the five-year national economic plan.

    Large-scale competitions have enabled many enterprises under the Ministry of Natural Resources to complete their annual plans ahead of schedule and to overproduce many tons of ore and coal. Coal production is one and a half times greater than that of 1944, and ore production is two and a half times greater than that of 1944.

    Machine manufacturing is one of the most advanced industries. For the first time in its history, Bulgaria has manufactured locomotives, tractors, trucks, etc. The production of the machine manufacturing industry has increased by 33 percent compared to 1939. In the past five years, the number of ferrous metal smelting enterprises has increased several times. At the same time, light industry is also advancing rapidly, with light industrial enterprises completing their annual production plans in eleven months. The best work teams, guaranteeing the production of all high-quality goods, have emerged in Bulgarian textile factories, with work team members learning from the examples of Soviet foremen Alexander and Zhutkik. New thermal and power plants and hydroelectric power stations, including Stalin, Topolka, Falkovitz, and other power plants, have been established. In 1949 alone, more than four hundred villages in the country gained access to electricity.

    Bulgaria has also shown great achievements in agriculture. By the end of 1949, Bulgaria had 1,603 agricultural cooperatives. The deep plowing and meticulous cultivation plan using fallow methods and the autumn sowing plan have been successfully completed.

    Due to the establishment of hundreds of new shops in towns and villages, the volume of trade has greatly increased.

    保去年经济计划胜利完成
    煤产量相当一九四四年一倍半，机器制造业生产较十年前增三分之一。
    【新华社北京七日电】塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚劳动人民已胜利结束一九四九年的经济年度——五年国民经济计划的头一年。
    大规模的竞赛，使得天然资源部所属许多企业能先期完成一年计划，并能超计划生产许多吨的矿苗和煤。煤的产量相当于一九四四年的一倍半强，矿苗则相当于一九四四年的两倍半。
    机器制造是最先进的工业之一。保国空前第一次地制造了机车、拖拉机、运货汽车等，机器制造工业的生产已比一九三九年增加了百分之三十三。在最近五年中，含铁金属冶炼企业的数目，已增加了好几倍。同时，轻工业也正在快步前进，轻工业的企业，已在十一个月内完成了一年生产计划。保证全部生产上等货的最优秀的工作队，已在保加利亚纺织厂里出现，工作队员都学习苏联领班亚历山大、朱特基克的榜样。新的热力与动力厂和水力发电站，包括斯大林、托普力卡、法尔科维茨及其他动力厂，已经建立起来了。光是一九四九年，国内又有四百多个村庄获得了电力供应。
    在农业上保加利亚也显示出很大的成就。到一九四九年底，保国已拥有一千六百零三个农业合作社。采取休耕法的深耕细作计划和秋季播种计划，已胜利完成。
    由于城镇与乡村里新成立了数百间商店，贸易额已大大增加。
