Experiences in Stabilizing Coal Prices

    I. The State Bank must cooperate closely with state-owned trading organizations.
    II. Vigorously support cooperatives.
    III. Unite small coal merchants around the state-owned economy.

The North China Coal and Iron Company has gained some experience in supplying coal to various regions, controlling the market, and stabilizing coal prices:

    (1) The State Bank and state-owned trading organizations must establish close contact and mutual cooperation. During the price fluctuations in November, many coal merchants in Tianjin and Tanggu borrowed large sums from local banks, attempting to buy and hoard large quantities of coal and manipulate the market. The banks in both locations immediately contacted the Coal and Iron Company and stopped lending to the coal merchants, thwarting the conspiracies of unscrupulous merchants, eliminating coal merchant speculation, and relatively stabilizing the market.

    (2) Vigorously support cooperatives. In Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, and other places, the branch companies have signed coal supply contracts with local cooperatives for winter coal supply, enabling the company to supply the coal needs of members in each area in a planned way. In Beijing and Tianjin alone, more than 25,000 tons of coal were supplied through cooperatives in November. This not only reduced the intermediate exploitation by private merchants and eliminated panic buying in the market, but also played a certain role in stabilizing prices.

    (3) In the past, the Coal and Iron Company often wholesaled coal by the truckload to large merchants, relying on them to supply the citizens. The company did not handle retail sales, and large quantities of coal were controlled by the coal merchants, who could manipulate prices to seek exorbitant profits. Since November, the Beijing and Tianjin companies have changed their approach, directly supplying coal to citizens and coal briquette shops. The company, in conjunction with local administrative departments, organized the small coal briquette shops in the two cities. The company stipulated quantities and prices, and coal was taken upon presentation of proof. The Beijing branch has now organized 150 coal briquette shops, and Tianjin has organized 116 coal briquette shop groups (15 households per group), who process and sell coal directly. This approach has not only cracked down on unscrupulous merchants and supplied small merchants, but has also played a huge role in stabilizing prices this time. In the future, the company should appropriately inspect and educate small coal shops, so that before cooperatives are universally established, they can be firmly united around the state-owned economy and serve as powerful assistants.

    平稳煤价经验
    一、国家银行必须与国营贸易机构密切配合。
    二、大力扶植合作社。
    三、把小煤商团结在国营经济周围。
    华北煤铁公司在供给各地煤斤，掌握市场，平稳煤价方面，获得几点经验：
    （一）国家银行与国营贸易机构必须取得密切联系和相互配合。十一月物价波动时，天津和塘大两地有不少煤商到当地银行贷巨款，企图大量购煤囤集，操纵市场，两地银行立即与煤铁公司取得联系，停止了对煤商的借款，击破奸商的阴谋，禁绝了煤商投机，相对的稳定了市场。
    （二）大力扶植合作社。北京、天津、保定、石家庄及张家口等各地在冬季供煤上，各分支公司都与当地合作社订立了供煤合同，从而使公司有计划地供给各该地社员煤的需要。仅京津两地在十一月份通过合作社供煤就有二万五千余吨，这不但减少了私商的中间剥削，消灭了在市场的抢购，对稳定物价起了一定的作用。
    （三）过去煤铁公司常把煤斤整车批发给大商人，依靠他们供给市民，公司不办理零售，大量煤斤掌握在煤商手里，他们即可操纵价格，以图暴利。自十一月份起，京津两地公司改变办法，直接供给市民与煤球铺用煤。公司与当地行政部门结合，把两地小煤球铺组织起来，公司规定数量和价格，凭证明取煤。现北京分公司已组织起一五○家煤球铺，天津组织了一百一十六个煤球铺小组（每组十五户），由他们进行加工直接售煤。此种办法，不仅打击了奸商，供给了小商，且对这次稳定物价起了极大的作用。今后公司应对小煤铺适当地进行检查和教育，使他们在合作社尚未普遍建立之前，巩固地团结在国营经济的周围，作有力的助手。
