Vice Chairman Liu's Reply:
    The Establishment of Formal Diplomatic Relations Between China and Korea
    Will Further Guarantee Peace and Stability in Asia

Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's reply is as follows:
    Mr. Ambassador:

    I am very pleased to accept the credentials presented by Your Excellency on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    China and Korea are neighbors sharing borders and have both suffered from imperialist oppression, and have carried out a long-term joint struggle against imperialism. The Chinese people express boundless sympathy for the heroic struggle of the Korean people to achieve the independence, democracy, and unification of their motherland, and express admiration for the achievements of the Korean people's construction. I believe that the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between China and Korea will be of great benefit to the future development of both countries and will further guarantee peace and stability in Asia.

    I warmly welcome Your Excellency to be the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the People's Republic of China, and I am willing to do my best to assist Your Excellency in your work to consolidate and develop the friendship between the two countries.

    I wish your country prosperity, your people thriving, and your head of state good health.
