Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 5th. A compilation of TASS Paris dispatches: The illegal detention of leaders of the "African Democratic Rally" by the colonial authorities of French West Africa's Ivory Coast has provoked strong protests from the French and West African people. Prominent French political leaders and representatives of the scientific, literary, and artistic communities issued an "Open Letter to All French Democrats" at the beginning of the year, protesting this act of brutality. The letter declares: The French colonial authorities' actions of racial hatred have become more frenzied than ever before. Police brutality, arrests, and politically motivated court judgments are occurring everywhere. Representatives of the French cultural world are calling on the French people to rise up against the persecution of the African democratic movement and against the infringement of people's freedom. The letter also points out that a committee must be established to defend freedom and justice and to demand an end to all atrocities against African political prisoners. The French parliamentary delegation of the African Democratic Rally, the Communist Party, and the Union of Progressive Republicans also met with French President Auriol on December 29th of last year, strongly protesting the French colonial authorities' atrocities against the residents of the Ivory Coast in French West Africa. A telegram sent to the French President from Fort Lamy, Africa, stated: "Four thousand African people, enraged by the Ivory Coast incident, gathered in Lamy at the end of December, declaring their support for the leaders of the African Democratic Rally imprisoned on Mount Grand-Bassam in the Ivory Coast and demanding their immediate release." These leaders have been in prison for more than ten months, and they began a hunger strike on December 12th of last year.

    要求殖民当局停止一切暴行
    【新华社北京五日电】综合塔斯社巴黎消息：法属西非象牙海岸殖民当局非法拘禁“非洲民主同盟”领袖的事件，已引起法国人民与西非人民的强烈抗议。法国著名的政界领袖和科学、文学与艺术界的代表，年初发表《告法国一切民主分子书》，抗议此一暴行。该书宣称：法国殖民地当局仇视种族的行动，已较已往任何时候愈益凶狂。警察暴行逮捕和法庭宣告政治性质的判决，竟到处发生。法国文化界的代表呼吁法国人民起来反对迫害非洲的民主运动，反对侵害人民的自由。该书并指出，必须成立委员会，以保卫自由和正义，要求停止对非洲政治犯的一切暴行。非洲民主同盟、共产党及进步共和分子同盟的法国议会代表团，亦曾于去年十二月二十九日会见法总统阿利奥尔，坚决抗议法国殖民当局对法属西非象牙海岸居民们的暴行。非洲雷姆要塞发来的致法总统的电文称：“四千非洲人民为象牙海岸事件所激怒，他们曾于十二月底在雷姆集会，声明支持被囚在象牙海岸大白山的非洲民主联盟的领袖，并要求立即释放他们。”这些领袖被关在监狱里已有十个多月，他们自去年十二月十二日起已开始进行绝食斗争。
