Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: According to TASS, Paris: The ship "Shepherd," carrying 3,000 soldiers and war materials, left Marseilles on the evening of the 10th for Vietnam, intensifying the criminal war against the Vietnamese people.

    A special correspondent for Jin Wanbao reported that on the 10th of this month, a large number of so-called "Republic Security Forces" were dispatched to the docks where the "Shepherd" was berthed in the port of Marseilles. Under the threat of "exposure and interrogation," sailors were ordered to immediately begin their duties. The police also attempted to prevent Andreani, the General Secretary of the dockworkers' union, from speaking to the dockworkers. However, the dockworkers protected Andreani and enabled him to speak. The police arrested Sherano, the General Secretary of the maritime workers' union, which has aroused strong protests from the local working people.

The demonstrating crowds gathered in front of the residence of the puppet South Vietnamese Chairman Tran Van Huu, demanding the immediate release of those arrested.

    【新华社北京十二日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：装载三千士兵和作战物资的“牧人”号轮，十日晚由马赛开赴越南，加紧对越南人民的罪恶战争。
    今晚报特派记者报道，在本月十日，大批所谓“共和国保安队”，被调至马赛港“牧人”号淀泊的码头，在“检举审讯”的威胁下，命令水手立即开始执行职务。警察并企图阻止码头工人工会总书记安德雷尼向码头工人讲话。但码头工人却保护了安德雷尼，并使他有讲话的机会。警察逮捕了海员工会总书记雪拉诺，此事已引起该地劳动人民的强烈抗议。
