    Soviet Industry Highlights

    New Universal Machine Tools
    In 1948, the Soviet machine-building industry manufactured more than one hundred types of the most modern new universal machine tools, including many automatic and semi-automatic special-purpose machines and combined machines. In 1949, the Soviet Union produced even more new and updated machine tools. The machine industries of Leningrad and Gorky refined new vertical, horizontal, and universal machine tools in large quantities.

    Various New Agricultural Machines
    In 1949, the Soviet machine industry began manufacturing 55 new types of agricultural machines, including beet and flax combine harvesters, tree planters, self-propelled weeders, and complex all-metal threshing machines. These highly efficient new machines will completely mechanize many labor-intensive production processes in agriculture.

    Electric Compound Coal Mining Machine
    Soviet engineers recently designed an electric compound coal mining machine, a world first. This machine turns the hopes and dreams of generations of miners into reality. This mining machine can automatically cut coal seams, dig coal blocks, and load the coal blocks onto conveyors. Each miner using this mining machine can produce ten to twelve tons more coal than with ordinary coal mining machines.

    Mechanized Stone Dressing and Bricklaying
    The Ukrainian machine industry recently began manufacturing newly designed compound stone dressing machines and bricklaying machines to mechanize stone dressing, stone transportation, and brick making. Each stone dressing machine can replace the labor of two hundred and fifty people. The productivity of the brick cutting machine is higher than that of foreign countries, and the vacuum brick press can press eight thousand bricks per hour.
    Many factories in the Soviet Union are replacing old machines with new machines and increasing the mechanization and automation of production processes. In Belarus alone, more than 10,000 new machines were installed by the end of 1949.

    Earthwork Will Be Fully Mechanized
    In 1949, the Soviet machine-building industry produced a large number of new machines to replace various heavy and arduous manual labor tasks. The amount of earthwork done in 1949 using excavators, bulldozers, graders, ditch diggers, and hydraulic machines increased significantly compared to 1948. In a few more years, earthwork can be fully mechanized, completely eliminating the need for manual labor.

    New Automatic Loaders
    Soviet engineers have recently designed several new machines that eliminate the physical labor of freight handlers. One type, a three-ton automatic loader, is being produced in large quantities. This machine only requires one person to manage, and its efficiency is equivalent to the work of sixty to seventy freight handlers.

    Widespread Use of Universal Brakes
    The universal brake designed by the famous Soviet inventor Matrosov is being widely used on Soviet railways. This brake can be installed on any train. This brake is the first of its kind in the world, as in the past, brakes for passenger cars and freight cars in other countries were manufactured separately.

    New Type of Automobile Gas Generator
    Soviet engineer Krong successfully designed a new type of automobile gas generator that burns firewood and peat. Old gas generators could only run for two to two and a half hours on a single refueling, while this new type can run for eight to fifteen hours. This engine can also be used in small power stations and agricultural machines.

    New Automatic Looms
    The Soviet machine manufacturing industry is producing a batch of new automatic looms, which enable each worker to tend to more than twice as many machines as before. An electrical device that measures the moisture content of cotton and yarn is also being widely used.

专栏：苏联工业集锦

    苏联工业集锦
    新型万能工作母机
    一九四八年，苏联机器制造工业制造了一百多种最现代化的新型万能工作母机，其中包括许多自动和半自动的特种工作机和联合工作机。一九四九年，苏联又生产了更多更新的工作机，列宁格勒和高尔基的机器工业，大批地精制了直立式、水平式和万能式的新型工作机。
            各种新式农业机器
    一九四九年，苏联机器工业着手制造五十五种新式的农业机器，其中包括甜菜和亚麻的联合收割机、植树机、自动推进除草器和复杂的全金属打谷机。这些有高度效能的新机器，将使农业中许多费劳力的生产过程完全机械化。
            电动复合采煤机
    苏联工程师最近设计了一种电动的复合采煤机，这是全世界的创举，这种机器使矿工们世代相传的希望和梦想变成现实。这种采煤机能自动砍煤层、挖煤块，并且把煤块装到运送带上。每个矿工使用这种采煤机，比普通采煤机可以多产煤十吨到十二吨。
            凿石砌砖机械化
    乌克兰的机器工业，最近开始制造新设计的复合凿石机和砌砖机，使凿石、搬运石头和造砖的工作机械化。每部凿石机可以代替二百五十人的劳动。切砖机的生产率比外国的高，真空压砖机每小时能压砖八千块。
    苏联的许多工厂，正在把旧式的机器换成新式的机器，并增加生产过程的机械化和自动化。仅白俄罗斯的工厂，一九四九年年底以前就已换装一万多架新机器。
            土方工作将完全机械化
    一九四九年，苏联的机器制造工业大量地生产各种新机械，来代替各种繁重辛苦的人力劳动。一九四九年用挖掘机、铲土机、开路机、掘沟机、水力机等所作的土方数量，比一九四八年增加很多，再过几年，土方工作就可以完全机械化，完全不用人力劳动。
            新式自动装载机
    苏联工程师最近设计了若干免除运货工人体力劳动的新式机器，其中一种三吨重的自动装载机，正在源源生产。这种机器只需一个人管理，而它的效率却等于六十至七十个运货工人的工作。
            广泛利用万能制动机
    苏联著名发明家马特罗索夫所设计的万能制动机，正广泛地在苏联的铁路上使用着。这种制动机能够装设在任何列车上。这种制动机，在全世界还是第一次出现，因为以前各国客车和货车的制动机都是分别制造的。
            新型汽车瓦斯发动机
    苏联工程师克朗设计成功一种新型的汽车瓦斯发动机，这种发动机烧木柴和泥炭。旧式的瓦斯发动机添一次燃料只能行驶两小时到两小时半，这种新型的却能行驶八小时到十五小时。这种发动机也可以应用于小型动力站和农业机器上。
            新式自动织布机
    苏联机器制造业正在制造一批新式的自动织布机，这种机器能使每一工人照顾相当于以前两倍多的机器。一种测量棉花和纱所含湿度的电力器械，也正在被广泛应用着。
