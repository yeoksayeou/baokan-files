    Lenin's Last Speech
    M. Baranovky

    Lenin's last speech was on November 20, 1922. Before this, for a long time, Lenin had been ill and living in Gorki Villa near Moscow. The injuries Lenin sustained during the assassination attempt in 1918, as well as continuous intense work, seriously damaged his health. Starting in the winter of 1921, he was repeatedly forced to interrupt his work.

    On October 2, 1922, Lenin moved from Gorki to Moscow. On November 20, 1922, the regular meeting of the Moscow Soviet's plenary session was held. The Grand Theater was packed. The representatives were discussing the issue of the city's economy. The chairman suddenly said:
    "Comrade Lenin will now speak."
    Lenin had not yet arrived, but the hall immediately erupted in a storm of applause. The representatives and guests welcomed Lenin's return to work with great joy. Shouts of "Hurrah" merged with the singing of "The Internationale" by the representatives and the guests attending the meeting. After a while, Lenin hurried out from the left side of the stage and headed towards the front edge of the stage. He calmly waited for a moment, then walked along the front edge of the stage, looked at his watch, and said: "It's time to stop applauding." The hall began to quiet down. Lenin walked to the front of the stage again, intending to begin his speech, but then a shout came from the back rows of the balcony: "Welcome, Ilyich!" – The hall erupted in another storm of applause. Lenin deeply felt the excitement in the hall and was himself moved.
    Finally, everything quieted down, and Lenin began his speech. At first, he spoke very slowly. Everyone felt that he was sick and had difficulty speaking. But then, Lenin spoke faster and with great passion.

    Lenin began by apologizing for not being able to attend earlier. He said that he had lost his ability to work for a long time since becoming ill, and therefore had to postpone the speech.

    Shortly before this historically significant speech, the Red Army and the guerrillas in the Far East liberated Vladivostok. This was the last corner of Soviet land where the heroic Soviet soldiers and guerrillas drove out the Japanese interventionists. Lenin mentioned Vladivostok and pointed to the diplomatic officials' box, saying: "...Vladivostok is very far away, but you must know that this city is ours!..." Everyone turned to look in the direction Lenin was pointing. He emphasized the meaning of his words with this gesture. The representatives applauded Lenin thunderously.

    In his speech, Lenin spoke about the New Economic Policy (NEP). At that time, the enemies of Soviet Russia had delusionally thought that the NEP would prevent us from moving towards socialism.

    After the Soviet regime victoriously ended the war with foreign interventionists, it turned to peaceful economic construction. Our country had been devastated by four years of the imperialist world war and three years of civil war. We—Lenin said—are living in conditions of a country so destroyed by war, and have suffered so much hardship and loss, that all our plans now cannot but start from small beginnings..."

    After the end of the civil war and the defeat of the foreign interventionists, the task of the Bolshevik Party was to achieve a strong economic alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry through correct economic policies. The only correct policy was the New Economic Policy. In March 1921, the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) adopted a historic decision based on Lenin's report: to replace the surplus grain requisitioning system with a tax in kind – the grain tax. According to this decision, all surplus grain left after paying the tax would be completely at the disposal of the peasants, and the peasants would be allowed to freely buy and sell this surplus grain. Lenin pointed out that the freedom of trade would initially cause some revival of capitalism within the country. But Lenin taught that some freedom of commodity circulation would create economic interest for the peasants, increase their labor productivity, and lead to a rapid upsurge in agriculture. On this basis, national industry would recover, and private capital would be squeezed out. After the Soviet regime accumulated strength and financial resources, it could establish a strong industrial base – the economic foundation of socialism – and then turn to a resolute offensive against the capitalist elements to eliminate the remaining capitalist remnants in the country. Such was Lenin's brilliant plan.

    "We are now retreating, seemingly backwards," Lenin said in his speech on November 20, 1922, "but we are doing this in order to retreat a little first, then take a running start and leap forward more powerfully."

    Lenin concluded his speech by saying:
    "Socialism is now no longer a question of the distant future... We have dragged socialism into everyday life, and here it should be carefully analyzed. This is the task of our era. Let me conclude with confident words: no matter how arduous this task is, no matter how novel it is compared with our previous tasks, no matter how many difficulties it will cause us – but we all together, not in a day or tomorrow, but within a few years, we all together will in any case solve this task and turn the Russia of the New Economic Policy into a socialist Russia."

    This was Lenin's last speech to the whole country.

    The words of the great Lenin have been realized. The great Bolshevik Party, under the leadership of Stalin, has turned Lenin's last words into living facts.

    Without foreign loans, but relying only on domestic resources, the Soviet Union has grown into a powerful socialist industrial power in the years of several Stalin Five-Year Plans. In 1924, Soviet factories assembled ten tractors and ten cars from some old parts. In 1938, Soviet factories were able to manufacture more than 200,000 cars and about 50,000 tractors using their own materials. At the beginning of the Third Stalin Five-Year Plan, Soviet industry already ranked first in Europe. In 1941, the output of Soviet industry was twelve times greater than in 1913.

    Under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Bolshevik Party completed Lenin's last words – we have built socialism in our country.

    The Russia of the New Economic Policy has become socialist Russia.

    Now, the Soviet state is successfully moving from socialism to communism.

    列宁的最后一次讲演
    Ｍ·巴朗诺夫斯基
    列宁的最后一次讲演是在一九二二年十一月二十号。在这以前，很久的一个时期，列宁一直病着，住在莫斯科附近的哥尔克别墅里面。列宁在一九一八年遇刺时所受的创伤以及连续不断的紧张工作，严重地摧残了他的健康。从一九二一年冬季开始，他便被迫屡屡中断其工作。
    一九二二年十月二日，列宁从哥尔克移居莫斯科。一九二二年十一月二十日举行莫斯科苏维埃全体会议的常会。大剧院里挤满了人。代表们正在讨论城市经济的问题。主席突然地说：
    请列宁同志讲话。
    列宁还没有来，但会场里立刻响起了暴风雨似的掌声。代表们和来宾们以极大的欢欣欢迎列宁的重返工作。“乌拉”的欢呼声，同代表们以及出席会议的来宾们所唱《国际歌》的歌声汇合起来。一会儿列宁从舞台左厢匆匆地走出，朝向舞台前缘。他从容地等待了一下，然后沿着舞台前缘走过去，看一下表，说：该停止鼓掌了。会场里开始静寂。列宁又复走到舞台前缘，想开始讲演，但，这时从楼座后排里发出了一个喊声：“欢迎你，伊里奇！”——会场里又响起了暴风雨似的掌声。列宁深深地体验到了会场里的激动，自己也激动了。
    最后，一切都静下来了，列宁才开始自己的讲演。起初，他说得很慢。大家觉得他有病，说话很费力。但接着，列宁讲的快起来，并带着极大的激昂。
    列宁先说自己的歉意，未能早些到会。他说，自从生病以后，很长的一个时期失去了工作能力，因而不得不推延讲演。
    在这次有历史意义的讲演之前不久，红军和远东的游击队解放了海参崴。这是英勇的苏维埃战士英雄们和游击队赶走日本干涉者的苏维埃土地的最后一个角落。列宁说到了海参崴，他用手指着外交官员们的包厢说：“……海参崴是很远的，但，要知道，这个城市是我们的啊！……”所有的人都转过身子，向着列宁用手指着的那个方面。他以这样的手势更加重了自己说话的意义。代表们暴风雨似地向列宁鼓掌。
    列宁在自己的讲演里讲了新经济政策。那时，苏维埃俄罗斯的敌人们曾妄想新经济政策将阻挡我们走向社会主义的。
    苏维埃政权胜利地结束了与外国干涉者的战争以后，便就转向和平的经济建设。我们的国家，由于四年的帝国主义世界大战以及三年的内战而已凋蔽不堪了。我们——列宁说——是生活在被战争如此破坏的国家之条件下，曾如此经受苦难和损失，以致我们现在的一切打算，不能不从小处着手……。”
    在国内战争结束和外国干涉者被击溃以后，布尔塞维克党的任务在于：以正确的经济政策达到无产阶级与农民的坚强的经济联盟。这个唯一正确的政策就是新经济政策。一九二一年三月俄共（布）第十次代表大会按照列宁的报告，通过了一个历史性的决定：以实物税——粮食税代替余粮征收制。根据这个决定，纳税以后留下的一切余粮，由农民完全支配，允许农民有买卖这些余粮的自由。列宁指出：买卖的自由最初会引起国内资本主义的某些的复苏。但是列宁教导说：商品流通的若干自由，将造成农民的经济上的关切，提高他们的劳动生产性，引向农业的迅速高涨。在这个基础上，国家工业才会恢复起来，私人资本才会挤出去。苏维埃政权积蓄力量和财力之后，就可以建立强大的工业——社会主义的经济基础，然后再转而向资本主义分子作坚决的进攻，以消灭国内的资本主义残余。列宁的天才的计划便是这样的。
    “我们现在正在退却，似乎是后退了——列宁在其一九二二年十一月二十日的讲演中说——但，我们这样做，是为的先后退一下，然后开步跑和更有力地向前跳。”
    列宁结束自己的讲演时说：
    “社会主义现在已经不是遥远的将来的问题了……。我们已经把社会主义曳入日常生活之中，在这里，应当好好加以分析。这就是我们这个时代的任务。让我以确信的话来作结束：不论这个任务怎样艰巨，不论它与我们从前的任务比较起来是怎样的新奇，不论它将给我们引起多少困难，——但是我们大家一道，不是明天一天，而是在几年之内，我们大家一道，无论如何终将解决这个任务，把新经济政策的俄罗斯变成为社会主义的俄罗斯。”
    这就是列宁对全国的最后一次讲演。
    伟大的列宁的话已经实现了。伟大的布尔塞维克党，在斯大林的领导下，把列宁的遗训变成了活生生的事实。
    不用外国借款，而只靠国内的资源，苏联在几个斯大林五年计划的诸年中，便成长为强大的社会主义的工业强国了。在一九二四年的时候，苏联的工厂中用一些旧零件装成了十部拖拉机和十部汽车，一九三八年苏联工厂便能用自己的材料制造出二十多万部汽车，五万部左右的拖拉机。在第三次斯大林五年计划开始之际，苏联的工业已占欧洲第一位了。一九四一年苏联工业的生产品，要比一九一三年多十二倍了。
    布尔塞维克党在斯大林同志的领导下完成了列宁的遗训——在我们国内建设成了社会主义。
    新经济政策的俄罗斯已经成为社会主义的俄罗斯了。
    现在，苏维埃国家正在成功地从社会主义进到共产主义。
                       （绪棠译自《新生一代》一九四九年第二期）
