The following is a biography of Vasil Kolarov, who was elected Chairman of the Council of Ministers by the Bulgarian National Assembly in accordance with constitutional procedures. He is a veteran comrade who fought alongside the great leader of the Bulgarian people, Georgi Dimitrov, for fifty years and is the successor to Dimitrov's great cause. Kolarov, at the age of seventy-three, was born on July 16, 1877, into the family of a shoemaker. From 1895 to 1897, while working as a teacher, he was already a leader of the teachers' movement despite his young age. He completed his law studies in Geneva in 1900, and it was during that period that he began to have frequent contact with Russian Marxists. Subsequently, in 1902, he joined the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers' Party and was elected to the Central Committee in 1905. Since then, he has frequently represented the party at international conferences. In April 1919, Kolarov was elected Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Together with Dimitrov, he led the Bulgarian people in the famous anti-fascist government movement in September 1923, for which he was sentenced to "death" by the reactionary government. In September 1944, the Soviet Union had achieved a decisive victory in the Soviet-German war. Under the great influence of this victorious situation, the Bulgarian people rose up to overthrow the reactionary government, declared war on the German invaders, and, with the assistance of the Soviet Red Army, gained true liberation. Kolarov immediately participated in the great construction of the motherland. When Bulgaria was officially declared a People's Republic in 1945, he served as Chairman of the Provisional Government. When Dimitrov served as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, he served as Vice-Chairman and Minister of Foreign Affairs. After Dimitrov's death on July 2, 1949, he succeeded him as Chairman and, after the establishment of the new National Assembly, resigned from the position in accordance with constitutional procedures. The National Assembly re-elected him as Chairman of the Council of Ministers because of Kolarov's great contribution to the people.
