Introducing the Experience of Introducing Winter Wheat in Suiyuan
Suiyuan Provincial Government Agricultural Department Zhang Lifan

Suiyuan, Chahar, the Northeast, and most of the Northwest are areas that grow wheat. However, for decades, wheat production has been very low. For example, in Suiyuan, wheat production only accounts for 10% of the total crop production. According to representatives from the Northeast, wheat production in the Northeast only accounts for 3.8% of the total crop production. The reason for not being able to produce more is not due to land limitations, but rather time constraints. The lowest temperature in Suiyuan is below minus 38 degrees Celsius, and north of the Daqing Mountains, it is as low as minus 40 degrees Celsius, with an average minimum of minus 5.3 degrees Celsius.

Flour is delicious, filling, and nutritious, but due to time constraints, wheat has not been planted on a large scale. How to increase wheat production is a problem that Suiyuan Province has been considering for a long time. In addition to selecting and breeding superior seeds, increasing fertilizer, and advocating intensive cultivation, the following two methods have been successfully researched and have been promoted for two years with good results.

I. Winter Wheat Cultivation: Experiments began in 1936 and have been successful through continued research and have been promoted in some areas. The cultivation experience of the past two years has proven that it not only grows well but also has several advantageous conditions.

(1) Drought Resistance: Because Suiyuan has more rain in autumn, sowing is done between the end of the heat and the White Dew period, and the soil retains sufficient moisture. Deep sowing allows the roots to penetrate deep into the soil to absorb moisture and nutrients, so it is drought-resistant, has a high yield, and is of good quality.

(2) Early Maturity and Reduced Disease: Winter wheat matures half a month earlier than spring wheat. Every year, in the middle of the first and middle periods of intense heat, the temperature is very high, and spring wheat often dies from heat and disease at this time. Rust also usually occurs at this time. Winter wheat, because it matures half a month earlier, can avoid these diseases.

(3) Breaking Natural Restrictions to Extend the Sowing Period: Previously, the wheat sowing period was only 20 days in spring. Before the Qingming Festival, the soil was frozen and could not be sown, and sowing too late was prone to heatstroke. Now, it has been increased from 20 days to 40 days, that is, there are also 20 days of sowing period in autumn. The extension of the period makes it possible to develop spatially and expand the planting area.

(4) Saving Production Costs: Spring wheat requires 15 jin per mu, while winter wheat requires 10-12 jin per mu. It can also utilize the leisure time of people and animals to work, which are all factors that save production costs.

(5) Reducing Winter Storage Losses: Spring wheat is stored from the autumn harvest of the first year to the spring sowing of the second year. After winter, it is susceptible to insect or rodent damage, while winter wheat is sown in the same year, with a short storage period that does not last through the winter, avoiding losses and ensuring a high germination rate.

Experimentation and Introduction Process:

Winter wheat seeds were purchased from the Wutai Mountains in 1936. The initial experiments were conducted in the Hetao area of Suiyuan. In the first year of the experiment, the sowing depth was one inch (the deepest general sowing is no more than one inch), and the time was two days after the White Dew period. By the time the ground froze, the seedlings had grown three to four inches, with a maximum of five tillers (spring wheat does not tiller). During the winter, the above-ground stems dried up, and the remaining parts were buried underground. The survival rate in the second spring was 20%. Subsequently, the work was interrupted for four years due to the war. In 1941, the reserved seeds were used to continue the experiment, with a sowing depth of five fen, and the results were very poor. The overwintering survival rate was 30%, possibly due to the seeds being stored for too long, resulting in a reduced germination rate. In 1943, the sowing depth was further increased (it was discovered that the size of the survival rate may be related to the depth, rather than the height or low of the temperature. If it were freezing to death, it should all freeze to death). Planting was done in areas with more soil clods because the gaps between the soil facilitate the entry of air. The sowing depth reached two and a half inches, and in areas with fine soil, the depth was two inches. This deep sowing increased the overwintering survival rate to 98%, thus understanding the reasons for previous failures. According to experience, the sowing period should be ten days after the end of the heat period north of the Daqing Mountains, and between the end of the heat period and the White Dew period for 20 days to the south, or no more than five days after the White Dew period (promotion was not dared without certainty). During the first promotion, the workers took the seeds to lead one or two farmers to try planting. The following year, they went to see the seedlings after germination, and the results were very good. Thus, this family was used as a typical example to teach nearby farmers to introduce the planting. This year, 5,000 to 6,000 mu have already been promoted.

II. Sowing Spring Wheat Seeds in Winter: Sowing is done when the soil is about to freeze (after the temperature drops below 5 degrees Celsius and no longer rises) until the land freezes. The sowing period is 20 days. The seeds are frozen underground and sprout in early spring next year, maturing one week earlier than spring sowing. Every family has these kinds of seeds, so many were promoted this year. The advantages are similar to winter wheat: drought resistance, fewer diseases, low production costs, and the ability to utilize the leisure time of people and livestock. The yield is higher than spring-sown wheat but less than winter wheat. This sowing method extends the sowing period by another 20 days. Now, Suiyuan has a total of 60 days of sowing period a year. Generally, farmers temporarily stop threshing after the autumn harvest and use this time to sow until the land freezes or until sowing is completed. In this way, labor and time can be properly utilized.

Suiyuan now has three other crops, barley, oats, and hemp, that can be sown in winter, and is continuing to experiment and research, hoping that more crops can be sown in winter to extend the cultivation time, expand the planting area, and increase production. Because the climate in the Northeast, Northwest, and Chahar-Suiyuan is similar, it is hoped that these two methods can be implemented and promoted, and it is also hoped that experts will provide scientific guidance.

    介绍绥远引种冬小麦的经验
    绥远省府农业厅  张立范
    绥远，察哈尔，东北，西北大部都是种小麦的地区。而几十年来，小麦的生产量却很小，如绥远小麦产量只占作物总产量的百分之十，据东北代表谈：东北小麦产量只占作物总产量的百分之三点八，不能多生产的原因，并不是受土地的限制，而是时间上不允许。绥远最低气温在零下摄氏三十八度以下，大青山以北最低到零下摄氏四十度，平均最低摄氏五点三度。
    面粉好吃，耐饥，营养好，但是受时间的限制，小麦一直没能大量栽种。如何增产小麦是绥远省考虑很久的一个问题，除用选育优良种籽，增加肥料及倡导精耕细作外；并且研究成功了以下两个方法，业已经过两年推广，成绩很好。
    一、冬小麦栽培：一九三六年开始试验，经继续研究，现已成功，而且推广了一部分地区。这两年栽培经验证明，不但生长良好，另外还具有几点有利条件。
    （一）耐旱：因绥远秋季多雨，播种在处暑与白露之间，土壤保有充足水分；并以深播，根部能深入土壤吸收水分和养料，所以耐旱，产量多，品质良好。
    （二）成熟期早，少受病害：冬小麦成熟期较春小麦早半个月。每年初伏与中伏中间，气温很高，春麦常在这时候因热而病死，一般锈病也在这时候发生，冬小麦则因成熟期早半个月，可避免这些病害。
    （三）打破自然限制延长播种时期：以前小麦播种时期只有春季二十天，清明前土冻不能播种，太靠后又容易得热病。现在却由二十天增加到四十天，即秋季也有二十天的播种期。时期的延长，使有机会向空间发展，扩大种植面积。
    （四）节省生产成本：春小麦每亩需十五斤，冬小麦则每亩十——十二斤，并可利用人畜休闲时间来工作，这些都是节省生产成本的因子。
    （五）减少冬藏损失：春麦从第一年秋收后储藏到第二年春播种，经过冬天，易受虫害或鼠害的损失，而冬麦则当年播种，储藏期短不过冬，可免损失旦发芽率高。
    试验引种经过：
    冬麦种籽是在一九三六年从五台山区采购来的，开始试验是在绥远河套一带，第一年试验时播种深度一寸（一般播种最深不过一寸），时间在白露后二天，播种后到地封冻时已长了三——四寸，苗最多分五蘖（春麦不分蘖），过冬时表土外面的苗干了，剩余部分埋在土下，第二年春成活率为百分之二十，此后受战争影响，工作中断四年，一九四一年利用保留的种子继续试验，播种深度五分，成绩很坏，越冬成活率为百分之三十，可能是由于种子存储时间过长，发芽率因之降低。一九四三年又将播种深度加深（发现成活率的大小可能与深度有关，而不是气温高低的关系，若是冻死，应刻都冻死），种在土壤结块多的地方，因为土间空隙易于通入空气，播种深度达二寸五分，土质细的地方深度二寸，这样深播，使越冬成活率提高到百分之九十八，因此了解了以前不能成活的原因。根据经验，播种期大青山以北宜在处暑后十天，以南则在处暑至白露间二十天，或在白露后五天以前（在没有把握时不敢推广）；第一次推广时，工作员把种籽带去，领导一、二农家试种，第二年发芽后去看，结果成绩很好，于是由这一家为典型，教给附近农家引种。今年已推广了五千至六千亩。
    二、用春麦种籽冬天播种：在土壤将近封冻的时候播种，（气温降到摄氏表五度以下不再上升以后）直到土地封冻时为止，播种期共有二十天，种子冻在土下，到明年春初麦苗发芽，比春播早成熟一星期。此种种籽，每家都有，故今年推广的很多，优点与冬麦相似：耐旱，病害少，生产成本低，可利用人工牲畜的休闲时期，其收获量多于春播麦，而少于冬麦。这种播种法播种期又延长二十天，现在绥远一年共有播种期六十天，一般农家在秋收后暂停打场，利用此时间来播种，直到土地封冻不能播或播完后才打场。这样劳力和时间都能得到适当的利用。
    绥远现在已经另有三种作物大麦、燕麦和麻可以在冬天播种，并且在继续试验研究，希望更多的作物能在冬季播种，延长耕作时间，扩大种植面积，使生产提高一步，因为东北、西北、与察绥气候近似，希望能把这二个方法实行推广，还希望各专家予以科学的指导。
