[Report from this newspaper] The upsurge of workers in various parts of North China purchasing public bonds continues to rise.

            Hangu
The Hangu No. 1 Factory of North China Chemical Industry has universally launched a campaign to be the first to give up bonuses and enthusiastically subscribe to public bonds. Among the thirteen members of the trade union committee, eight gave up all their bonuses, and four gave up half. Committee member Zhang Ruquan didn't want his bonus and also bought 35 shares of public bonds. All the workers in the laboratory gave up their bonuses. Comrade Zhao, the chief of the engineering section, used all his bonus to buy 7 shares of public bonds. From the 5th to the 12th of this month, in one week, a total of 845 shares of public bonds were subscribed, saving bonuses equivalent to about 10,000 catties of millet.

            Liulihe
All 365 employees of the Liulihe Cement Plant subscribed to 534 shares. And because the employees of the factory widely publicized the subscription, it influenced 19 short-term workers who push clay and coal to jointly buy 10 shares.

            Tanggu
The Tanggu Telecommunications Bureau enthusiastically subscribed to 523 shares of public bonds, exceeding the total trade union's call for subscriptions by 70 percent.

            Tianjin
The Tianjin Textile Industry workers' purchase of public bonds has exceeded 70,000 shares. Among them, the average number of purchases per employee in Factory No. 5 is the highest, with 8 shares per person, creating the highest record of average individual subscription performance in various factories of the textile industry. All the workers in the factory are proud of this and wrote to Chairman Mao to report the achievements of the workers in Factory No. 5 in taking the lead in subscribing to public bonds, while explaining that this is to express their gratitude, love, and sincere support for Chairman Mao. The Tianjin Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, with 125 employees in the entire bureau, has subscribed to 730 shares. Most of them subscribed with half of their annual bonus. The second group of the trade union achieved the best results, with 11 people subscribing to 135 shares.

            Fenyang
After the Fenyang Special District Bank Office uniformly arranged to study the New Year's Day editorial of the Xinhua News Agency and issued public bonds, it set off an upsurge of purchasing public bonds. Fifty-five people subscribed to 134 shares. Because most of the employees are in difficult circumstances, they all sincerely said, "I would rather save a little more, and it would be good to be able to buy one share every month." Among them, Director Zhang Hanwen purchased 25 shares alone and recognized subscribing to public bonds as a great honor.

            Tangshan
The Linxi Brigade of the Public Security Corps of the Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan launched a challenge of public bond subscriptions between squads and between individuals. Clerk Wu Comrade played an exemplary role and subscribed to 30 shares. All the comrades unanimously requested to tighten their belts and buy one share if they have the strength for one share. As a result, all 200 members of the brigade bought more than 1,000 shares.
