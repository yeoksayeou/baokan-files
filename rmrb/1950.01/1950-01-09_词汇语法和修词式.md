    Vocabulary, Grammar, and Rhetorical Devices
    Shao Yanxiang

    Now is precisely the time when everyone is accustomed to being careless and unwilling to deliberate over vocabulary, grammar, and rhetorical devices. Mr. Ye Shengtao's "Essays on Language" in the People's Garden on the 4th is a beneficial reminder. Every writer should examine themselves carefully in light of this.

    First, Mr. Ye Shengtao expressed his agreement with Mr. Jiang Hua's article "Strive to Repudiate Confusing Vocabulary." Indeed, artificially constructed words like "drive and compel," "sound past," "urine and feces," "pat and caress," and even "beg for a drink" are neither "popular" nor "elevated," and are indeed repulsive. Probably no one would object to "striving to repudiate" them.

    Second, Mr. Ye Shengtao spoke about grammar and rhetorical devices. Let's start from here.

    Mr. Ye Shengtao believes that the word "当" (dāng, when/just at) in "当下工的汽笛鸣过" (dāng xià gōng de qìdí míng guò, the shift whistle blew) "comes from translated texts" and is not found in general language. Therefore, writing it into an article is open to discussion. But does it mean that only what is found in general language can be written into an article? Take what Mr. Ye Shengtao said: "人家也不过知道你在那里喜欢罢了" (rénjia yě bùguò zhīdào nǐ zài nàlǐ xǐhuan bàle, people just know you like it there), the "罢了" (bàle, only/that's all) is rarely said in ordinary conversation, but does it necessarily mean that "罢了" cannot be written into an article? "罢了" did not come from translated texts, and it is no different from the "当" that came from translated texts. The problem lies entirely in being accustomed to it, which then "sounds pleasant to the ear and easy to read." I think the so-called "work or not work" need not focus on "taking root in the mouths of most people." Whether an article "flows smoothly" mainly depends on more than just the one or two characters "当" or "罢了." I am talking about general articles here; literary creation should be discussed separately.

    Mr. Ye Shengtao pointed out the "grammar of two parallel verbs followed by an object," such as "采用与洗炼有生命的语汇" (cǎiyòng yǔ xǐliàn yǒu shēngmìng de yǔhuì, adopting and refining living vocabulary). I believe that this grammar can be used in general articles and documents, and in some key moments, it is even necessary. Because this often can scientifically fix the meaning of the entire sentence, and at the same time avoid wordiness. Adding one word would be too much, and subtracting one word would be too little. It is very suitable, although "this comes from books," it fully meets the two conditions of "first, making up for the defects of our original grammar" and "second, working, becoming conventional through agreement, and adopted by everyone." Especially in general articles and documents, adopting and popularizing it, what's wrong with that? Mr. Ye Shengtao said: "Popularity in documents and meetings may not count," which is open to discussion.

    Speaking of rhetorical devices, Mr. Ye Shengtao believes that phrases such as "义愤填膺" (yìfèn tiányīng, filled with righteous indignation) and "欢欣若狂" (huānxīn ruòkuáng, overjoyed) are not easy to use, but I don't quite agree. I think they can be used, precisely because they are often used in "telegrams" and "news reports." The characteristic of "telegrams" and "news reports" is brevity. For example, if a news item intends to describe the situation of the masses being "欢欣鼓舞" (huānxīn gǔwǔ, elated), and the conditions do not permit enumerating specific facts like in a longer report, it is bound to look for phrases with stronger generalization. Instead of fruitlessly circling around in rhetoric, it is better to simply use ready-made phrases. This also has the advantage that it will never sacrifice meaning for the sake of words, and because they are idioms, they are more likely to give readers or listeners a familiar and direct feeling. All this is not a "problem" of any telegram or news report writer "not looking for" or "not learning," but rather a matter of accommodating conditions on the one hand, and strengthening the effect of the text on the other.

    Finally, my opinion is that literary creation, documents, telegrams, newspaper articles, and general articles all have their own unique characteristics. They should not be discussed together in terms of vocabulary, grammar, and rhetorical devices, let alone be rigidly taught to "fit" a certain "model." The problem lies here. This is open to discussion.

    词汇语法和修词式
    邵燕祥
    现在正是大家都惯于粗枝大叶，懒得斟酌什么词汇、语法和修词式的时候，四日人民园地叶圣陶先生的《语文随笔》算是一个有益的提醒。每一个拿笔杆儿的，都应该联系自己，好好作一番检讨。
    首先，叶圣陶先生对江华先生《要努力驳逐使人糊涂的词汇》一文表示首肯。诚然，象“驱迫”“鸣过”“尿便”“拍抚”以至“讨喝”这些硬造的词汇，既不“普及”，又不“提高”，的确让人望而生厌，“要努力驱逐”它们，大概没人会有异议。
    其次，叶圣陶先生说到语法和修词式的问题。咱们就从这儿说起。
    叶圣陶先生认为，象“当下工的汽笛鸣过”的“当”字，“是从翻译文字来的”，一般语言里是没有的。因此写进文章去就可以讨论。但是一定要一般语言里有的才能写进文章吗？拿叶圣陶先生所说：“人家也不过知道你在那里喜欢罢了”的“罢了”，平常也很少有人说，但是一定说“罢了”不能写进文章里去吗？“罢了”并非从翻译文字来的，也和从翻译文字来的“当”没有什么区别，问题全在习以为常，也就“听来爽耳，读来爽口”了。我以为所谓“行得开行不开”，不必斤斤于“要在大多数人的嘴上生根”，文章能不能“上口”，主要的关键倒还不在“当”或者“罢了”这一两个字上。我这说的是一般的文章，文艺创作应该另说。
    叶圣陶先生指出的“两个并列的动词下面贯到目的格的语法”，象“采用与洗炼有生命的语汇”这样的语法，我认为在一般文章和文件里就是可以用的，在某些节骨眼上，还是必须用的。因为这样往往可以科学地固定整个一句话的意义，同时又可以避免罗嗦，增一字则太多，减一字则太少，非常合适，虽然“这是从书本子来的”，但是在“一要弥补咱们原来语法的缺陷”，“二要行得开，约定俗成，大家采用。”这两个条件上，它全够格，特别是在一般文章和文件上采用、流行，有什么不好呢？叶圣陶先生说：“在文件上集会上流行未必能算数”，倒是可以讨论的。
    再说修词式。叶圣陶先生认为诸如“义愤填膺”，“欢欣若狂”一类的语句不好运用，我不很同意。我认为可以用，也正是因为它们常常用在“通电”和“报道文章”里。“通电”和“报道文章”的特点是在简炼，比方一条新闻打算说明群众“欢欣鼓舞”的情况，在条件不许可象较长篇报道一样来枚举具体的事实的时候，势必要寻找概括性较强的语句，与其徒劳地在修词上兜圈子，不如索性运用现成的语句。这样还有一个好处，就是绝不会以词害意，并且由于它们是成语，更加容易给读者或听众以亲切而直捷的感觉。这一切并不是任何一个通电或报道文章执笔者“不去找”“不去学习”的“毛病”，而是一方面为了迁就条件，一方面为了加强文字的效果的缘故。
    最后，我的意见是：文艺创作、文件、通电、报章文章，一般的文章，都各有其独自的特点，在词汇、语法和修词式上，不可混同在一起谈，更不该硬教它们来“就”一定的“范”，问题在这里。这是可以讨论的。
