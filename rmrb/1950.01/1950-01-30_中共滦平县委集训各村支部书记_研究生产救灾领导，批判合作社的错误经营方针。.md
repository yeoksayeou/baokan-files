    CPC Luanping County Committee Trains Village Branch Secretaries
    Studying Leadership in Production and Disaster Relief, Criticizing Erroneous Management Policies of Cooperatives.
    [This News] Rehe News: The CPC Luanping County Committee held the first village branch secretary training class in late December of last year. During the training, the main education for the trainees was to clarify that the main task of the Communist Party branch in the countryside is to lead production, and that at present, special attention should be paid to educating party members to lead the masses, organize the masses to carry out sideline production, and overcome disasters. First, the trainees were mobilized to correctly estimate the seriousness of the disaster by calculating detailed accounts. After studying, the village branch secretaries felt that they had not paid enough attention to sideline production in the past. They only saw the large-scale commercial transportation, and ignored the various small-scale sideline productions, and did not know that concentrating these scattered products for external sales could solve a great deal of difficulty in the lives of the masses. They did not grasp the leadership of the village cooperatives, so the cooperatives did not play a role in promoting the masses' local products, supplying the masses' production and living materials, and organizing the masses to produce, and became partnership stores set up solely for making money. After discussion, the village branch secretaries all realized that it is necessary to change the management policy of the cooperatives so that the cooperatives can play their due role in the future. At the same time, based on the actual conditions of their own villages, the trainees made plans to lead the masses to carry out sideline production and save money to overcome the famine after returning to the village, and prepared to reorganize the organization, educate party members, take the lead in sideline production, and lead the masses to complete the plan.

    研究生产救灾领导，批判合作社的错误经营方针。
    【本报讯】热河消息：中共滦平县委会于去年十二月下旬举办了第一期村支部书记训练班。训练中，主要教育学员明了农村共产党支部的主要任务是领导生产，目前应特别注意教育党员，领导群众、组织群众开展副业生产，战胜灾荒。首先发动学员用算细账的办法，正确估计灾荒的严重性。各村支书学习后都感到以前对副业生产重视不够。只看到数量较大的商业运输，忽视了各种各样的小规模副业生产，不知道把这些零碎生产品集中向外推销就可以解决群众生活上很大的困难。对村合作社没有抓紧领导，所以合作社在推销群众土产，供给群众生产、生活资料，与组织群众生产上没起作用，变成专为赚钱而设的合伙商店。经过讨论之后，各村支书都认识了要转变合作社的经营方针，使合作社在今后起到应有的作用。同时根据自己村里的实际情况，各学员作出了回村后领导群众开展副业生产和节约渡荒的计划，并准备回去整理组织，教育党员，在副业生产中起带头作用，领导群众完成计划。
