    Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 9th: The Xinjiang National Army, which had persisted in fighting the Kuomintang reactionaries for many years, has been officially reorganized into the Fifth Army of the People's Liberation Army. To resist the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and the massacres by bandits, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang initially organized a guerrilla force with only primitive weapons such as knives, spears, and axes. In battles with the Kuomintang bandit troops, they equipped themselves with captured enemy weapons and gradually grew stronger in battle. On April 8, 1945, the guerrilla force was officially reorganized into the regular National Army, beginning more heroic battles, and successively liberating the people of the Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan (Chenghua) areas. The members of the National Army included outstanding sons and daughters of various ethnic groups such as Uyghur, Kazakh, Sibe, Tatar, Mongolian, Hui, and Han, who were united like a big family, and further established a flesh-and-blood connection with the people of all ethnic groups. In the most difficult years, the people of all ethnic groups voluntarily donated winter clothing, drove herds of fine horses, and sent large quantities of comfort goods and letters of appreciation to support the National Army. The National Army repaid the people by eliminating the enemy and helped the people with production during the busy farming seasons. In order to ensure that every commander and fighter had a high sense of serving the people, each company had a dedicated person to lecture the soldiers, and small group discussions were held regularly. Colonel Haishan Nuf, one of the leaders of the National Army, excitedly said: "We have been looking forward to joining forces with the People's Liberation Army day and night, and now it has finally come true. In the future, we will build a new Xinjiang under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party!"
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 8th: The troops under General Tao Zhiyue of Xinjiang, who revolted last September, have been officially reorganized into the Twenty-second Army Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. By order of the Military Commission of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Committee, Tao Zhiyue is the commander of the army corps, and Wang Zhen is concurrently the political commissar. The army corps was officially announced on December 29th in Dihua.

    【新华社迪化九日电】与国民党反动派坚持多年斗争的新疆民族军，已正式改编为人民解放军第五军。新疆各族人民为了反抗国民党的反动统治，反抗匪帮的屠杀，开始时组织了一支只有刀、矛、斧等原始武器的游击队，在和国民党匪军作战中，用缴获敌人的武器装备了自己，在战斗中逐渐发展壮大。一九四五年四月八日，游击队正式改编为正规的民族军，开始了更英勇的战斗，先后解放了伊犁、塔城、阿山（承化）地区的人民。民族军的成员包括维吾尔、哈萨克、锡伯、塔塔尔、蒙、回、汉各民族优秀的儿女们，大家团结得像一个大家庭，与各族人民更进一步地建立了血肉相关的联系。在最艰苦的岁月里，各族人民自动捐出寒衣，赶来一群一群的骏马，送来大批的慰劳品和慰问信，支援着民族军。民族军用消灭敌人来报答人民，并在农忙的季节帮助人民生产。为了使每个指战员都有高度的为人民服务的思想，每个连队都有专人为战士讲课，经常举行小组讨论会。民族军领导者之一海山努夫上校兴奋地说：“我们日夜盼望与人民解放军会师，现在终于实现了，今后我们要在中国共产党领导下建设新新疆！”
