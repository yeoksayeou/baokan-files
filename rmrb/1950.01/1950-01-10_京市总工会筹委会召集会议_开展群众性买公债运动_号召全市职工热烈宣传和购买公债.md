    【Report from our newspaper】The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened a meeting on the 7th, bringing together trade union workers from various units, including state-owned factories, private industries, and shop assistants, to discuss the issue of workers purchasing government bonds. The meeting decided that the "Municipal Workers Subscription to People's Victory Real Value Government Bonds Promotion Committee," which was established a few days ago, would be formally renamed the "Beijing Municipal People's Victory Real Value Government Bonds Promotion Committee Workers Branch." Each factory and private industry can establish branches under the leadership of the trade union to strengthen promotion and make the purchase of government bonds a mass movement. Xiao Ming, director of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said in his speech: when purchasing, it is necessary to consider one's own financial capacity; buy one share if you can afford one share, buy two shares if you can afford two shares; it is also acceptable for two or three people to jointly buy one share, and absolutely no compulsory or rigid allocation should be adopted. The person in charge of the trade union of the Shijingshan Power Plant also reported on the situation of government bond sales in the plant. They have seventy trade union groups, and as of the day before yesterday, they had subscribed to 1,642 shares, averaging two and a half shares per person. On the 9th, Zu Chugong from the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions broadcast a speech on the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station, calling on all municipal workers to enthusiastically promote and subscribe to People's Victory Real Value Government Bonds. He first listed exemplary cases of the Beijing working class taking the lead in supporting the government's decisions with practical actions, praising them and saying: This is a concrete manifestation of our working class being masters of the country and having a high degree of patriotism. Then, he explained in detail the reasons why the government issued People's Victory Real Value Government Bonds in order to overcome the state's financial difficulties amidst victory and stabilize the people's livelihood. He also introduced the various benefits of the method of issuing government bonds. Finally, he called on workers to enthusiastically promote and subscribe to government bonds. He said: When promoting and mobilizing subscriptions, I hope everyone will pay attention to starting from the actual situation of each worker, buying as much as they can afford, and never forcing anyone; the principle of voluntarism must be completely adhered to, and no compulsory orders can be implemented. Trade unions and workers can only persuade each other to purchase, and are not allowed to apportion or distribute equally. The trade union must not first decide on an amount and then mobilize everyone to self-report and discuss it publicly; this is a disguised form of coercion, which will make it very difficult for some workers with poor economic conditions and heavy family burdens. In addition, we must enthusiastically promote and encourage our relatives, friends, neighbors, and people from all walks of life in society, especially industrial and commercial capitalists, wealthy households in urban and rural areas, and retired wealthy civil and military officials, to save a portion of their daily consumption, subscribe to government bonds, temporarily lend them to the government, and overcome the difficulties of victory in 1950 together.

    京市总工会筹委会召集会议
    开展群众性买公债运动
    号召全市职工热烈宣传和购买公债
    【本报讯】北京市总工会筹委会于七日召集各公营工厂、私人行业、店员等各单位的工会工作者举行会议，讨论职工购买公债问题。会上决定日前成立的全市职工认购人民胜利折实公债推销委员会正式定名为北京市人民胜利折实公债推销委员会职工分会。各工厂和私人行业可在工会的领导下成立支会，加强宣传，使购买公债成为一种群众性的运动。市总工会主任萧明讲话时说：购买时要看个人的力量，能买一分买一分，能买两分买两分；两个人或三个人合伙买一分也行，绝对不能采取强迫或硬性的分配。石景山发电厂工会负责人并报告该厂公债推销的情形，他们有七十个工会小组，到前日止已认购了一千六百四十二分，平均每人两分半。九日市总工会筹委会祖出工，在北京人民广播电台广播讲演，号召全市职工热烈宣传和认购人民胜利折实公债。他首先列举北京工人阶级首先用实际行动拥护政府的决定的模范事例，给以表扬，他说：这是我们工人阶级当家作主人和高度爱国心的具体表现。接着他详细的说明了为了克服胜利中的国家财政困难，安定人民生活，政府发行人民胜利折实公债的道理。并介绍了发行公债办法的种种好处。最后号召工人热烈宣传和认购公债。他说：在宣传动员认购的时候，我希望大家一定要注意到必须从每一个工友实际的情况出发，能买多少，就买多少，千万不要勉强，要完完全全以自愿为原则，不能实行任何强迫命令。工会和工友们彼此间只能进行劝购，不许摊派，不许平均分配。工会更不能先决定了一个数目，然后发动大家自报公议，这是一种变相的强迫命令，这样会使得一些经济条件很差、家累很重的工友感到非常困难。此外我们还要热烈地随时随地向亲友们，向邻居们，向社会上各界人士们，特别是工商业资本家，城乡的富户们，退职的有钱的文武官吏们进行宣传鼓励，动员大家节省下日常生活中的一部分消费，认购公债，暂借给政府，共渡一九五○年胜利中的困难。
