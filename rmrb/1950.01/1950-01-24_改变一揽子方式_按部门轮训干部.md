	Each department uses training classes to understand cadres, become familiar with the situation, and build grassroots work.
	Based on the leadership's intentions, concentrate student opinions as training content.
	Three steps of learning: mobilize students to raise questions; summarize and critique; then review again.

[This newspaper's Northeast News] The Northeast region has successively launched winter rotational training for district and village cadres. The Cadre Materials Statistics Section of the Civil Affairs Department of the Northeast People's Government, based on specific understanding of seven counties, including Jiaohe, Huachuan, Nehe, Acheng, Jin County, Tieling, and Liaoyang, and some summary materials from various places, has summarized the initial experience in running training classes during this period:

Facts have proven that the main key to running training classes lies in the leadership of the county. Many places, based on local conditions and the needs of central work, make overall plans for the entire county, change the one-size-fits-all approach, and train district assistants and village cadres from the same business departments in each period, according to the civil affairs, public security, education, and other business systems. The main cadres of the county personally take charge of the training classes. The business learning of the students is the responsibility of the responsible cadres of the business departments of the trainees (such as training civil affairs cadres led by the head of the Civil Affairs Section of the County People's Government, training public security cadres led by the head of the County Public Security Bureau). The students are organized into groups according to districts, with the district assistant as the backbone. In this way, the business is unified, which is convenient for the progress of the course; and it also allows the upper and lower levels to communicate and exchange experience in the business; the responsible cadres of the county government departments can deeply understand the cadres and become familiar with the situation through the training classes; each department systematically builds grassroots work through the training classes. For example, before Nehe County held training classes, the work of each village was concentrated on a few people such as the chairman of the village government. After the village cadres were trained, each committee member had a clear division of labor, and the work in the village was on the right track. Experience has proven that the above method of training cadres is relatively successful. In addition, in special circumstances, such as several villages or certain districts needing to solve the same kind of problem, or having special tasks to be deployed, the main cadres of these villages and districts are mobilized to receive training together, focusing on solving problems and deploying tasks. For example, in Kedong County, there was a general problem of coercion and commandism and bureaucracy in the leadership style of two districts, so they were all mobilized for training; also, some counties, in order to solve certain work in the new districts, selected better district and village cadres for special training, and after the training, they were used as work teams and sent to work in the new districts, partially solving the difficulty of having fewer cadres in the new districts. However, some counties generally adopt a one-size-fits-all training method, mobilizing various cadres with different business requirements to receive training together. As a result, the course is difficult to teach, the central work is not well integrated with the training, and it is impossible to solve the various different problems of many cadres in a short period of time, so the training results are small.

The training content must be combined with reality and the current central work. For example, Nehe County has now trained five sessions of district and village cadres according to various business natures. Each session has tightly grasped the business center, allowing the students to raise all the difficulties in their work, and then further organize them to discuss, and finally raise them to the height of policy principles and summarize them in a popular way according to the intentions of the leadership, and use this as the training content. Because practical problems were solved, the students were very happy and unanimously reflected: "The problem has really been solved." "The burden has been thrown away, there is a way, I must work hard when I go back!" On the contrary, some counties have subjectivism and dogmatism. For example, some only talk about "laws of social development", and some counties talked about twenty-five problems in five days. The students reflected: "I didn't understand anything", "Anyway, the superiors have said it, let's guess like riddles!" This method naturally cannot solve the problem. In terms of teaching methods, district and village cadres generally have a low level of education, and discussion should be the main focus, supplemented by explanation. Counties such as Acheng, Huachuan, and Nehe have adopted three steps. On each issue, they first consciously guide and inspire, mobilize students to raise questions and expose their thoughts, and then, in response to these different thoughts, simply summarize them to the policy principles, and finally mobilize everyone to review so that they can truly digest them. Some counties only take two steps, first reporting and then discussing, or first discussing and then reporting. This method can save time when the actual situation is truly grasped and there is more mature experience; otherwise, the students will not accept it deeply. Various lively methods should be used in the explanation and discussion. Experience has proven that typical examples give the students the greatest educational significance. For example, when the Huachuan County short-term training class discussed how to lead mass work, most of the students initially believed that "tasks cannot be completed without coercion and commandism." Later, the chairman of Jixian Village reported his experience of completing and exceeding the task by persuading and mobilizing and leading by active elements, and everyone's thinking changed. The Nehe County Culture and Education Committee training class used typical reports to summarize the experience of running winter schools last year. The students said: "We also have a way to run winter schools when we go back." Some counties have created many lively discussion and learning methods in the training, such as organizing debates on the pros and cons of an issue, asking students to raise the backs of their hands and palms to answer yes or no questions, and holding visits and lectures, all of which are very effective. On the contrary, some counties give hard lectures and hard instillations, lecturing for half a day, and as a result, the students doze off and cannot learn.

In addition, the county leaders should plan to do a good job of pre-training preparation and mobilization, grasp the rural situation, and make preparations as soon as possible for when to train which cadres under the overall plan of the county, and arrange for the trainees to prepare typical experience reports in advance to make the training more effective. In some counties, because the mobilization was rushed, the students did not take care of their family affairs and were worried about their families during the study, and they were not at ease to study. Some districts even temporarily forced students to attend by drawing lots or elections; some county leaders did not pay attention to the work of rotational training of cadres, and there was no preparation in advance. During the training, the main cadres only gave reports, so the effect was poor. Some counties have not even set up training classes.

    改变一揽子方式
    按部门轮训干部
    东北总结冬训初期经验
    各部门通过训练班，了解干部，熟习情况，建设基层工作。
    依据领导意图，集中学员意见，作为训练内容。
    学习的三个步骤：发动学员提出问题；总结批判；再作检讨。
    【本报东北讯】东北各地已相继开展冬季轮训区村干部工作。东北人民政府民政部干部材料统计科根据蛟河、桦川、讷河、阿城、锦县、铁岭、辽阳等七县具体了解及各地一部分总结材料，归纳出此一时期办理训练班的初步经验：
    事实证明，办训练班的主要关键在于县的领导，很多地方根据当地情况与中心工作的需要，全县通盘计划，改变了一揽子的方式，按民政、公安、文教等业务系统，每期调训同一业务部门的区助理员和村干部。县主要干部亲自掌握训练班。学员的业务学习，责成受训学员业务部门的负责干部来领导（如训练民政干部由县人民政府民政科长领导，训练公安干部由县公安局长领导），学员按区编成小组，以区助理员为骨干。这样，业务统一，便于课程的进行；而且使上下通气，交流了业务中的经验；县府各部门的负责干部通过训练班可以深入了解干部，熟习情况；各部门有系统地通过训练班建设了基层工作。如讷河县在训练班举办以前，各村工作集中在村政府主席等少数人身上，村干部受训以后，各委员作了明确分工，村里工作走上正轨。经验证明，上述调训干部方法是比较成功的。此外，在特殊情况下，如几个村或某些区里有同一性质的问题需要解决，或有专门任务布置，就调集这些村区的主要干部一齐受训，集中解决问题，布置任务，如克东县有两个区在领导作风上普遍存在着强迫命令和官僚主义，因此把他们全部调来进行训练；又如有些县为了解决新区的某些工作，抽调较好的区村干部作专题训练，训练后就当工作队用，派赴新区工作，部分地解决了新区干部少的困难。但有的县一般地采用一揽子的训练方式，把业务不同要求不同的各种干部调来一块受训，结果课程难讲，中心工作与训练结合不好，在短期内不可能解决许多干部的各种不同问题，训练成绩就小了。
    训练内容必须结合实际，结合当前中心工作。如讷河县到现在已按各种不同业务性质训练了五期区村干部，每期都紧紧掌握了业务中心，让学员把工作上所有的困难都提出来，再进一步组织他们讨论，最后提高到政策原则高度，依据领导意图，通俗地加以总结，即以此为训练内容。因为解决了实际问题，学员们都很高兴，一致反映：“真给解决了问题。”“包袱扔掉了，办法有了，回去非好好工作不可！”反之有的县存在着主观主义和教条主义，如有的只空讲“社会发展规律”，有的县则五天讲了二十五个问题。学员们反映：“一点也没有懂”，“反正上级讲了，咱们就像猜谜似地猜吧！”这种方式自然解决不了问题。在教学方法上，因区村干部一般文化水平低，应以讨论为主，讲解为辅。阿城、桦川、讷河等县采取三个步骤，在每个问题上首先有意识地引导启发，发动学员提出问题，暴露思想，其次针对这些不同的思想，通俗地提高到政策原则上给以简明的总结，最后发动大家检讨，使之能够真正消化。有的县只采取两个步骤，先报告后讨论，或先讨论后报告。这种办法在真正掌握了实际情况和有比较成熟经验时，能节省时间；反之则学员接受不深刻。在讲解讨论中应采用各种生动活泼的方法。经验证明，典型实例给学员的教育意义最大，如桦川县短训班讨论如何领导群众工作时，起初大多数学员认为“不强迫命令就不能完成任务”，后来集贤村主席报告了他以说服动员、通过积极分子带头完成而且超过任务的经验之后，大家的思想转变了。讷河县文教委员训练班用典型报告总结了去年办冬学的经验，学员们说：“回去办冬学咱也有办法了。”有的县在训练中创造了许多生动的讨论、学习的方法，如组织对一问题正反意见的辩论，出是非题目由学员伸出手背手心来回答，举办参观、讲演会等，都很收效。反之，有的县硬上大课，硬往下灌，一讲半天，结果学员打瞌睡，学不进去。
    此外，县领导上应有计划地作好训练前的准备动员工作，掌握农村情况，在全县通盘计划下，什么时候调训什么干部，早作准备，并事先布置受训学员准备典型经验报告，使训练收效更大。有的县因动员仓卒，学员没有料理家事，学习中记挂着家里，不安心学习，有的区甚至用抽签、选举等方法临时强派学员；有的县领导上不重视轮训干部工作，事先无准备，训练中主要干部只去做做报告，因此收效差。有的县甚至还没有把训练班办起来。
