Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 18th. The London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the Colombo Conference on the 16th, stating: The Colombo anti-communist regional conference cannot be separated from the double game that Britain seems to be playing in China. The epoch-making victory of the powerful Communist Party-led Chinese people has greatly changed the balance of power, thus benefiting the Southeast Asian people who are waging a just struggle for national independence and social progress.

However, the performance of the Labor imperialists in Colombo makes them look like panicked people, trying to block a breached dam with a few spoonfuls of sand. These imperialists are still plotting intrigues.

They were forced to recognize the Central People's Government of China, but have not severed de facto relations with Chiang Kai-shek's remnants in Taiwan, and they did not vote in the United Nations Security Council to expel the rejected and unrepresentative Chiang Ting-fu.

This ambiguous trickery is fraught with serious dangers to world peace. The labor movement should put an end to these tricks, and in particular insist, as the Communist Party has rightly and repeatedly stated, on the immediate cessation of the barbaric war in Malaya and the withdrawal of British troops.

    英工人日报评科伦坡会议
    英帝玩弄两面手法
    【新华社布拉格十八日电】伦敦工人日报于十六日发表评论科伦坡会议的社论称：科伦坡反共地方会议，不能与英国似乎正在中国玩弄的两面手法分开。强大的共产党所领导的中国人民的划时代胜利，已经极大地改变了力量对比，因而有利于正在为争取民族独立和社会进步而进行正义斗争的东南亚人民。
    但是，工党帝国主义者在科伦坡的表演，使他们看来好像是惊慌失措的人，还试图用几匙沙土来堵住一个溃堤。这些帝国主义者还在进行阴谋勾当。
    他们被迫承认了中国中央人民政府，但是，却未与台湾的蒋介石残余断绝事实上的关系，而他们在联合国安理会中，也没有投票赞成开除被拒斥的与无代表性的蒋廷黻。
    这种暧昧的诡计充满着对于世界和平的严重危险。劳工运动应使这些诡计结束，特别要坚持共产党所曾正确地反复声言的，要求立即停止马来亚的野蛮战争，并撤退英军。
