Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 27th. The United Nations Trusteeship Council, which representatives from the Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries refused to attend, illegally passed on January 24th the so-called "Italian Trusteeship Agreement for Somaliland," which permits Italy to station troops in Somaliland. This agreement was drafted by the "Somaliland Trusteeship Committee" based on a draft presented by the Italian government on January 4th. It adopted the original draft's arrogant demands that violate the peace treaty with Italy without any changes, including the demand that the United Nations allow Italy to establish naval and air force facilities, maintain its own troops, and organize a "volunteer army" in the area. The so-called "Somaliland Trusteeship Committee" was established by the Trusteeship Council based on the resolution on the disposal of Italian colonies illegally passed by the UN General Assembly last year.

According to a United Press report, when the Italian draft was discussed in this committee composed of six countries—the United States, Britain, France, Iraq, the Philippines, and the Dominican Republic—the demand for Italian trusteeship received full support from the United States and Britain due to "Somaliland's enormous strategic importance." Reuters reported that an Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman announced on January 24th that 3,000 Italian military police were ready to enter Somaliland as soon as the Italian parliament approved the trusteeship agreement. The British government issued a statement on January 25th, planning to hand over Somaliland to Italy in mid-March and "take all necessary measures" to prevent the local people from resisting Italian trusteeship.

TASS, citing a commentary in Izvestia on this conspiracy by the US-UK imperialist bloc, pointed out that the US-UK bloc's ambition to consolidate old bases and establish new bases in Somaliland is the basis for Italy's demand to establish bases in Somaliland. The policy of the US-UK bloc and the Italian ruling group that carries out its orders, on the one hand, absolutely violates the resolution to resolve the issue of former Italian colonies in a fair and democratic way, and on the other hand, has nothing in common with the interests of the Italian people. The Italian people absolutely do not need to use colonial undertakings to firmly tie Italy to the war chariot of new war instigators.

    托管理事会非法通过
    竟准许意托管索马利兰
    充分暴露美英集团掠夺基地又一阴谋
    【新华社北京二十七日电】为苏联及人民民主国家代表所拒绝出席的联合国托管理事会，竟于一月二十四日非法通过准由意大利驻兵索马利兰的所谓“意大利十年托管索马利兰协定”。该协定系“索马利兰托管委员会”根据意大利政府于一月四日提出的草案拟成，并原封不动地采纳了原草案违反对意和约的狂妄要求，其中包括要求联合国允许意大利建立海空军设备，维持其自己的军队，并在该地组织“志愿军”，所谓“索马利兰托管委员会”，则是托管理事会根据去年联大违法通过的关于处置意大利殖民地的决议而成立的。
    据合众社消息，当意大利草案在由美、英、法、伊拉克、菲律宾与多米尼加等六国组成的这个委员会上讨论时，由于“索马利兰具有巨大的战略重要性”，由意大利托管的要求得到美英两国的全力支持。路透社报道意大利外交部发言人于二十四日宣布，三千意大利军警已准备就绪，一俟意大利议会批准上项托管协定，即将开入索马利兰。英国政府则于二十五日发表声明，拟在三月中把索马利兰移交给意大利，并将“采取一切必要措施”，以防止当地人民反抗意大利的托管。
    据塔斯社引消息报评论美英帝国主义集团这一阴谋时指出，美英集团要在索马利兰巩固旧基地并建立新基地的野心，乃是意大利要求在索马利兰建立基地的根据。美英集团与执行其命令的意大利统治集团的政策，一方面既绝对违反以公平和民主的办法来解决前意大利殖民地问题的决议，同时与意大利人民的利益也没有丝毫共同之处。意大利人民绝不需要用殖民事业来把意大利牢固地束缚在新战争煽动者的战车之上。
