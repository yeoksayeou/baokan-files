Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th. The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, in order to develop the production and trade of bristles, fats, and hides, convened the National Bristles and Hides Meeting and the Fats Meeting in December of last year. These meetings formulated the 1950 management plans for national state-owned companies. The relevant responsible persons and experts from major administrative regions attended these meetings. These meetings respectively studied the historical situation and current status of the production and export of bristles, fats, and hides nationwide, and determined the operating principles, organizational structure, product specifications, purchase prices, capital allocation, and cooperation with private merchants for the three commodities.

The decisions of these meetings: The state will uniformly export bristles in order to correct the past exploitation of the Chinese people through unequal exchange by imperialists. China's bristle exports account for more than 70% of the world's demand, therefore it is possible and necessary for the state to统销 (monopolize sales). At the same time, state-owned trading organizations may, under the principle of unified prices, give commissions to private exporters for consignment sales. In terms of procurement, the state will continue to统购 (monopolize purchasing) bristles in the Northeast, while private individuals will be temporarily allowed to buy and sell in other parts of the country. Private individuals will be allowed to operate in both fats and hides in order to expand exports and restore their position in the international market. The internal procurement of fats should be strengthened to promote the production of oilseeds for export and to restore and develop the export of vegetable oils and oilseeds. The state-owned hides should focus on export, supplemented by domestic sales, and should organize local processing to reduce costs, and minimize the export of raw materials as much as possible while increasing the export of finished products.

These meetings respectively studied the specifications of the three finished products, and decided that the quality of export products must be strictly inspected to establish international credibility. These meetings also studied the purchase prices of the three, emphasizing that the interests of farmers must be properly taken into account when purchasing to stimulate production.

These meetings decided to establish three national specialized companies to carry out the raw material procurement, processing and distribution of the three commodities. These three companies are the China Bristle Company, the China Fats Company, and the China Animal Products Company. The head offices of these companies are located in Beijing, and branch offices will be established in various places. The work plans of the branch offices are uniformly stipulated by the head office, and cadres and funds are uniformly dispatched by the head office, and are led by the financial committees and trade departments of various regions. The procurement and processing of bristles, fats, and hides in Northeast China, which was originally unified by the local products company, will not be changed for the time being as jointly decided by these meetings. Other regions where hides and bristles are currently operated by joint ventures may also not be separated for the time being due to a lack of cadres and because it is the procurement season, so as not to affect business; however, active preparations for separate operations must be made during this period.

    贸易部召开猪鬃皮毛及油脂会议
    成立全国专业公司统一收购加工运销
    【新华社北京十五日电】中央人民政府贸易部为发展猪鬃、油脂、皮毛的生产和贸易，特于去年十二月间先后分别召开全国猪鬃皮毛会议和油脂会议，分别制定了一九五○年的全国国营公司的经营计划。出席这些会议的有各大行政区的有关负责人和专家。这些会议分别研究了全国猪鬃、油脂、皮毛的生产和外销的历史情况与现状，确定了三者的经营方针、组织机构、产品规格、收购价格、资金分配和团结私商经营等重要问题。
    这些会议的决定：猪鬃由国家统一外销，以纠正过去帝国主义者以不等价交换榨取中国人民。中国猪鬃输出占全世界需要量的百分之七十以上，因此有可能和必须由国家统销。同时，国营贸易机关得在统一的价格原则下，酌给佣金，委托私人出口商代销。在收购方面，东北猪鬃仍继续由国家统购，其他各地暂时仍准许私人在内地买卖。油脂和皮毛都准许私人经营，以扩大出口，恢复两者在国际市场上的地位。油脂之内地收购应予加强，促进外销油料的生产，恢复与发展植物油及油料的出口。国营皮毛以外销为主，内销为辅，应组织就地加工，以降低成本，并尽可能减少原料出口，增加成品出口。
    这些会议分别研究了三项成品的规格，并决定必须严格检查出口产品的质量，以树立国际信誉。这些会议都研究了三者的收购价格，着重指出收购时必须适当照顾农民利益，以刺激生产。
    这些会议分别决定成立三个全国性的专业公司，进行三者之原料收购、加工与运销工作。这三个公司是中国猪鬃公司、中国油脂公司、中国畜产公司，其总公司均设于北京，并在各地设分支公司。各分支公司之工作计划由总公司统一规定，干部、资金由总公司统一调度，并受各地区财委及贸易部之领导。东北猪鬃、油脂、皮毛之收购与加工，原由土产公司统一进行，经这些会议共同决定暂不改变。其他各地区目前皮毛和猪鬃为合营公司者，因干部缺乏，且正值收购季节，亦可暂不分开，以免影响业务；惟在此期间须积极准备分别经营。
