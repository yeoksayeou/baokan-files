East China's Textile Industry Advances Overcoming Difficulties!
By our Shanghai Correspondent Zhou Ziqin

I. A Recent Look at the Textile Industry in East China

The textile industry in East China leads the nation, encompassing Shanghai, Qingdao and Jinan in Shandong, northern and southern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, and Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Zhenhai in Zhejiang. The region has a total of 177 public and private textile factories, with 3,716,818 spindles (accounting for 71.8% of the nation's total) and 46,705 looms. If silk reeling and weaving are included, the proportion is even greater. East China also holds a significant share of the nation's woolen textile equipment. For example, of the 85,384 woolen spindles nationwide, East China has 78,624, accounting for 92% of the national total. Of the 19,016 yarn spindles nationwide, East China has 18,056, accounting for 95% of the national total. Regarding woolen spindles, mule spindles account for 41.7%, and ring spindles account for 53% of the national total. These figures demonstrate that the largest portion of the nation's cotton and woolen spindles are concentrated in East China, with Shanghai being the center of East China's textile industry.

Regarding machinery operation, there is a significant difference between pre- and post-liberation. Taking the China Textile Corporation (中纺) as an example, before liberation, from January 1946 to March of last year, the highest spindle operation rate only recovered to 88.86%. In April of last year, it briefly increased to 93%. However, by May, on the eve of Shanghai's liberation, the spindle operation rate dropped to 77.1%, and looms also decreased from the highest rate of 87.2% in January to 71.3%. After Shanghai's liberation in June, the spindle operation rate increased to 81.4%, and looms increased to 78%. However, due to the enemy's blockade of Shanghai, difficulties in sourcing raw cotton, and the temporary disruption of inland transportation, sales of yarn and cloth were sluggish, leading to a reduction in production. During the most difficult month of July, both spindle and loom operation rates fell to 77%. From August onwards, the situation gradually improved, with the spindle operation rate increasing from 81.1% in August to 83.4% in November, and the loom operation rate increasing from 79.7% in August to 82.6% in November.

The gradual improvement of the textile industry can also be seen in yarn and cloth production. For example, the China Textile Corporation's cotton yarn production in June of last year was 21,783 bales, slightly decreasing in July, but rising to 22,454 bales in September and 30,532 bales in November, an increase of 41.1% compared to June. Cotton cloth production was 449,180 pieces in June, decreased to 428,183 pieces in July, but rose to 482,798 pieces in September and 661,457 pieces in November, an increase of 47.2% compared to June. The production decrease in July and August was mainly caused by the enemy's blockade, while the gradual increase in production after August demonstrates the significant achievements we have made in countering the blockade. Other products, such as processed cloth, woolen yarn, woolen fabrics, yarn, ribbon, and silk, have also seen significant improvements. Concurrently with the increase in production, the rate of substandard cloth is also gradually decreasing. For example, the China Textile Corporation's substandard cloth rate was 10.0% in June, 11.2% in July, 8.4% in August, 6.1% in September, and 5.9% in October. These figures demonstrate that production is indeed progressing.

Other regions are also experiencing similar improvements. After liberation, the Qingdao China Textile Corporation has increased its spindle operation rate to 97% and its loom operation rate to 99%, averaging 95%. The operation rate in southern Jiangsu is 77%, in northern Jiangsu 86%, and in southern Anhui 96%.

II. Methods for Overcoming Difficulties

How exactly did East China overcome the most difficult months of July and August and achieve this victory against the enemy's blockade?

As a result of the Kuomintang's traitorous policies, a serious crisis of China's industrial colonialism had been created. After the liberation of Shanghai, the enemy implemented a criminal blockade, adding many difficulties to our production recovery. However, we were not intimidated. On the contrary, at the very beginning of the enemy's blockade, Shanghai proposed self-reliance, breaking free from dependence on imperialism, and simultaneously proposed the policy of "facing the interior, changing the direction of production," transforming the economy that was previously dependent on imperialism into a new democratic, independent, and autonomous economy. The following economic reforms were carried out: First, in order to realize the production direction of facing the interior and facing the countryside, the yarn count was changed from fine yarn to coarse yarn, increasing coarse yarn and reducing fine yarn to meet the needs of the vast number of peasants. From August onwards, it was stipulated that yarn of 32 counts or higher should only account for 23%, with the remainder being coarse yarn. Improvements were made to the types of yarn and cloth produced to meet the needs of the broad masses in the countryside. Yarn and cloth were required to be strong and durable, with increased production of various colored cloths and reduced production of bleached cloth and woolens. Second, domestic cotton was used to replace American cotton, achieving self-sufficiency in raw cotton supply in the future and breaking the imperialist blockade. Third, the significant increase in production in each factory by November, and the launch of the production and conservation emulation campaign in the China Textile Corporation factories, played a significant role; this was a very important factor.

While overcoming difficulties, attention was also paid to the coordination of other tasks: First, the rapid improvement and restoration of domestic water and land transportation, and the organization of intermodal transport, ensured smooth material exchange between inland cities and rural areas, which added favorable conditions for the steady transportation and supply of domestically produced raw cotton to the textile industry. Second, the establishment of joint public-private raw cotton purchasing agencies ensured planned, organized procurement and rational allocation of raw materials. Third, based on raw cotton reserves, a plan was made in July to reduce working hours and proactively and systematically reduce production until new cotton became available, at which point production would be increased. Therefore, production gradually increased again after October. Fourth, in trade union work, workers were vigorously educated to unite with capitalists. In order to overcome difficulties and maintain production, many workers in private factories proactively proposed reducing wages and benefits, increasing working hours, improving quality, and reducing costs, which encouraged the production enthusiasm of capitalists. In addition, the government's labor bureau made great efforts in mediating labor-capital disputes. All of these efforts greatly benefited the improvement of production.

In state-owned factories in Qingdao, Jinan, Hangzhou, and other regions, the principle of firmly relying on workers was upheld, workers' political awareness was educated and improved, factory democratic management was strengthened, and new labor attitudes were established. On this basis, waste was opposed, production inspections were carried out, and waste materials were cleaned up and utilized, resulting in significant achievements. For example, after inspecting production, the Qingdao China Textile Corporation No. 2 Factory cleared out as many as three million pieces of old materials, and workers' morale was generally improved, with the average machine operation rate increasing to 97%, and the highest reaching 99%. In the Hangzhou Textile Factory, workers were relied upon, factory democratic management was initially implemented, and unreasonable systems such as the body search system were abolished, which increased workers' production enthusiasm and initiative.

III. Several Issues in Future Construction

At the East China Textile Industry Conference last November, several issues in future construction were raised:

First, regarding raw materials: In order to achieve self-sufficiency in raw cotton production, East China is required to expand cotton field planting by 16 million mu in 1950, completing the plan to increase raw cotton production by 4.2 million dan. To ensure the quality of cotton production, it is necessary to preserve high-quality cotton seeds. Therefore, the improved cotton seed promotion areas within Shanghai and Baoshan, Jiading, Taicang, Changshu, Nanhu, Fengxian, and other counties are designated as cotton seed management areas, and high prices are paid for high-quality cotton seeds. The Cotton Improvement Department of the Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Department of the East China Financial and Economic Committee will dispatch technical personnel to reside in the cotton seed management areas to guide and inspect each ginnery's handling of improved cotton seeds in order to strengthen the preservation of high-quality seeds.

In terms of woolen raw materials, East China's existing woolen textile equipment requires 102,000 dan of greasy wool per month. Currently, the national wool production is approximately 800,000 dan per year, which is far short of demand. Overall planning must be adopted. Secondly, it is recommended to improve sheep breeds and promote pastures. In addition, regarding ramie raw materials, China's annual production of ramie is approximately 4,469,600 dan, accounting for more than 80% of the world's production, and there are still exports every year, so there are no problems with ramie raw materials.

Second, the issue of democratization of factory management: Factory administration and trade unions should cooperate well, first strengthening the education of all employees ideologically and improving their awareness and discipline. Establish factory management committees to absorb workers' participation. Regarding unreasonable wage systems, any that do not comply with the principles of equal pay for equal work and remuneration according to labor should be rationally reformed through individual adjustments, democratic evaluations, and approval from higher authorities. Individual adjustments should also be made to the phenomena of wage inconsistencies and lack of uniformity between factories and departments. Unreasonable systems left over from the past reactionary forces (such as the body search system) must be abolished, but workers must be organized to discuss the methods of abolition and study how to more effectively protect state property and prevent possible biases during abolition.

Third, concluding collective contracts. In order to better resolve labor-capital disputes in private enterprises and jointly ensure the realization of production plans, collective contracts should be universally signed in private enterprises, either by factory or by industry. Even in public enterprises, collective contracts must be established, with the content mainly including production plans, wage systems, and worker welfare issues, which is of great significance for future development of production and economic prosperity.

Fourth, it is estimated that the national demand for yarn and cloth will greatly increase. For future development, it is necessary to concentrate talent, prepare in advance, and study the manufacturing of textile machines. At present, the manufacturing and repair of machine parts should be carried out with a plan. Regarding the training of specialized technical personnel, it is necessary to start with experienced workers in factories to prepare for the further development of East China's textile industry.

    华东区纺织工业在克服困难中前进！
    本报驻沪记者  周子芹
    一、华东纺织业的近貌
    华东区纺织工业为全国之冠，包括有上海和山东的青岛、济南，江苏的苏北、苏南，安徽的皖南，浙江的杭州、宁波、镇海等处。全区共有公私营纺织厂一七七家，纺锭三，七一六，八一八枚（占全国纺锭百分之七十一·八），织机四六，七○五台，如算上缫丝及丝织业，比重更大。华东区毛纺织设备在全国范围说，也占有很大的比重。如梳毛纺锭全国为八五，三八四枚，华东为七八，六二四枚，占全国纺锭百分之九十二；绒线锭全国为一九，○一六枚，华东为一八，○五六枚，占全国百分之九十五；纺毛纺锭：其中走锭占百分之四十一点七，环锭占全国百分之五十三。这些数字说明：全国棉、毛纺锭的最大部分都集中在华东地区，而上海则为华东纺织工业的集中地。
    在机器运转方面，解放前后有很大不同。以中纺为例，解放前由一九四六年一月到去年三月份，纱锭运转率最高标准只恢复到百分之八十八点八六，去年四月，曾一度提高到百分之九十三。但到五月解放前夕，纱锭运转率即下降到百分之七十七点一，织机也由一月份最高标准百分之八十七点二降到百分之七十一点三。六月上海解放之后，纱锭运转率又提高到百分之八十一点四，织机提高到百分之七十八，但因为敌人对上海的封锁，原棉来源困难，内地交通一时又未恢复，纱布销路不畅，以致发生减产现象，到最困难的七月时，纺锭及织机运转率均下降到百分之七十七。八月以后又逐渐好转，纱锭又由八月份百分之八十一点一提高到十一月份的百分之八十三点四，织机亦由八月份百分之七十九点七提高到十一月份的百分之八十二点六。
    在纱布产量方面也可看出纺织业在逐渐好转。如中纺棉纱在去年六月份产量为二一，七八三件，七月后稍有下降，但九月份即上升为二二，四五四件，十一月份为三○，五三二件，较六月份增加百分之四十一·一。棉布产量：在六月份为四四九，一八○件，七月份降为四二八，一八三件，九月份即上升为四八二，七九八件，十一月份为六六一，四五七件。较六月份增产百分之四十七·二。七、八月份的减产，主要是在敌人封锁下所造成的，八月以后生产又步步上升，这是我们在反封锁上收到的巨大成绩。其他如加工布、毛纱、毛织品、绒线、纱带、绢丝等都同样有很大提高。与产量增加的同时，次布率也在逐渐减少，如中纺次布率六月为一○·○，七月为一一·二，八月为八·四，九月为六·一，十月为五·九。用这些数字说明生产的确是在前进中。
    其他地区也在同样的好转中。青岛中纺在解放之后纺锭运转率已提高到百分之九十七，织机已到百分之九十九，平均为百分之九十五。苏南运转率则为百分之七十七，苏北百分之八十六，皖南百分之九十六。
            二、战胜困难的方法
    华东到底用什么办法渡过最困难的七、八两月，而从反对敌人的封锁中获得这种胜利呢？
    由于国民党卖国政策的结果，造成了中国工业殖民地性的严重危机，上海解放之后，敌人实行了罪恶的封锁，使我们恢复生产增加了许多的困难。但是，我们并没有被吓倒，相反的，在敌人的封锁一开始，上海方面就提出自力更生，打破对帝国主义的依赖，同时提出“面向内地，改变生产方向”的方针，把过去依附帝国主义的经济，改变成为新民主主义的独立自主的经济。并进行了以下的经济改革工作：一、为实现面向内地，面向农村的生产方向，把纱支由细支纱改粗支纱，增加粗支纱，减少细支纱，以便适合广大农民的需要。从八月份起就规定纺三十二支纱以上的只占百分之二十三，其余全纺粗纱。改善纱布生产种类，以适应广大农村群众需要，纱布务求坚实耐久，增产各种色布，减少漂白布和呢绒。二、改用国棉代替美棉，做到以后原棉供应上的自给自足，不再依赖外棉，以打破帝国主义的封锁。三、到十一月份各厂产量均有很大提高，中纺各厂的生产节约竞赛运动的展开，是起了很大的作用，这是一个很重要的因素。
    在克服困难中，同时也注意了其他各种工作的配合：一、国内水陆交通的迅速改善和恢复，组织联运，使内地城乡物资交流畅通，这对纺织业国产原棉的源源运输供应上，增加了有利的条件；二、公私营原棉联购机构的成立，作到有计划，有组织的采购与合理分配原料；三、根据原棉储藏量，从七月份就计划减少开工时间，主动的有计划的减低生产，到新棉上市再提高生产，因此到十月以后在生产上又逐渐提高。四、工会工作上也大力教育工人团结资本家，不少私营工厂工人为了渡过困难，维持生产，主动提出减低工资待遇，增加工作时间，提高质量，减低成本等，鼓励了资本家的生产积极性，此外政府劳动局对劳资争议的调处上，也作了很大的努力。这些工作都大大有利于生产的改进。
    在青岛、济南、杭州等地区的公营工厂中，坚决依靠工人的原则下，教育与提高工人的政治觉悟，加强工厂的民主管理，建立新的劳动态度。在这个基础上，反对浪费，进行生产检查，清理与利用废物料，收到了很大的成绩。如青岛中纺二厂在检查生产后，清查出的旧料即达三百万件之多，工人情绪普遍提高，机器运转率平均提高到百分之九十七，最高者达百分之九十九。杭州纺织厂方面，由于依靠了工人，初步实行了工厂的民主管理，取消了抄身制等不合理的制度，提高了工人的生产热情和积极性。
            三、今后建设中的几个问题
    去年十一月，在华东纺织工业会议上，曾提出了今后建设中的几个问题：
    第一、关于原料问题：为要达到原棉生产的自给自足，要求华东区一九五○年推广棉田种植一六○○万市亩，完成增产原棉四二○万市担的计划。为保证棉产质量，必须保存优良棉种，因此划定以上海市及宝山、嘉定、太仓、常熟、南汇、奉贤等县内改良棉种推广地区为棉种管理区，高价收买优良棉籽。华东财政经济委员会农林水利部棉业改进处，为加强良种保纯工作，决派技术人员分驻棉种管理区内，指导与检查各轧花厂对改良棉种之处理。
    在毛纺原料方面，华东现有纺毛设备月需油毛十万二千担，目前全国产毛量全年约八十万担，相差甚远。必须采取统筹办理。其次是建议改良羊种，推广牧场。此外，麻纺原料，我国年产苎麻约四，四六九，六○○万担，占世界产量百分之八十以上，每年尚有出口，故麻纺原料尚无问题。
    第二、工厂管理民主化问题：工厂行政和工会应很好配合，首先从思想上加强对全体职工的教育，提高其自觉性和纪律性。建立工厂管理委员会，吸收工人参加。对不合理的工资制度，凡不符合同工同酬、按劳取酬原则的，要采取个别调整、民主评定、经上级批准等办法，予以合理改革。对厂与厂、部门与部门之间工资不协调、不统一的现象，也要进行个别调整。对过去反动派遗留下来的不合理的制度（如抄身制度等），必须取消，但要组织工人自己讨论取消的办法，并研究如何更有效的爱护国家的财产，防止取消时可能发生的偏向。
    第三、订立集体合同。为更好的解决私营企业的劳资争议，共同保证生产计划的实现，在私营企业中应以工厂或行业为单位，普遍签订集体合同。即使在公营企业中，也须建立集体合同，内容主要包括生产计划，工资制度，工人福利诸问题，这对今后发展生产繁荣经济有极大意义。
    第四、估计到全国的纱布需要量将大大增加。为了将来的发展必须集中人才，预作准备，研究纺织机的制造问题。在目前则应首先有计划的进行机器配件的制造和修理。关于专门技术人才的培养，首先要从工厂老工人中进行，为华东纺织工业的进一步发展作好准备。
