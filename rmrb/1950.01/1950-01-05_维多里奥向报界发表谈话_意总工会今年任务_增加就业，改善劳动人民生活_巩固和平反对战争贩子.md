Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: TASS, Rome—Vittorio, Secretary-General of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, discussed the General Confederation of Labor's achievements in 1949 and its tasks for 1950 with the press at the end of 1949, stating: The General Confederation of Labor's action program stems from an analysis of the current situation and a firm belief that it is possible to improve the country's economic situation. In 1949, there were two million unemployed people in Italy, two million partially employed people, 1.5 million agricultural workers and laborers who only worked for a few months throughout the year, and one million disabled people and pensioners who could barely survive. The general living standards of the people were far below the level of 1938. In 1949, the General Confederation of Labor conducted a struggle for wages and achieved victory. The General Confederation of Labor's anti-layoff struggle helped at least 100,000 metalworkers, textile workers, and chemical workers avoid unemployment. Farmers waged a heroic struggle for land and obtained tens of thousands of hectares of wasteland, marking the beginning of the land reform movement.

However, at present, layoffs still threaten thousands of workers, and the crisis of war is growing, with war preparations underway. Therefore, the tasks of the General Confederation of Labor in 1950 are to strive to improve the living standards of the working people, to fight for increased employment, to consolidate peace, and to oppose all conspiracies of the warmongers.

Vittorio then discussed the economic plan for resolving unemployment proposed by the General Confederation of Labor at its October congress, stating: The National Economic Conference, initiated by the General Confederation of Labor with the participation of renowned economists and technical experts, will open on January 29 to discuss the technical aspects of this plan, which will then be submitted to Parliament as a bill. 1950 will be a year of struggle for the General Confederation of Labor to implement its economic plan.

    维多里奥向报界发表谈话
    意总工会今年任务
    增加就业，改善劳动人民生活  巩固和平反对战争贩子
    【新华社北京四日电】塔斯社罗马讯：意大利总工会总书记维多里奥于一九四九年底向报界讲述总工会一九四九年的成就及一九五○年的任务称：总工会的行动纲领，是从对当前形势的分析和对有一切可能改善国家经济形势的确信出发的。一九四九年，意大利全国有二百万人失业，二百万人部分就业，一百五十万农业工人和农业劳动者全年只工作几个月，有一百万残废者和领受养老金的人几乎不能维持生存。人民一般的生活水平远低于一九三八年的水平。在一九四九年，总工会进行了争取工资的斗争，并获得了胜利。总工会的反解雇斗争，至少帮助了十万金属工人、纺织工人和化学工人免于失业。农民为争土地作了英勇的斗争，并获得了数万公顷的荒地，这是土地改革运动的开始。
    但是，在目前，解雇仍威胁着数以千计的职工，战争的危机也正在增长，战争的准备正在进行。因此，总工会在一九五○年中的任务，是争取改善劳动人民的生活，为增加就业为巩固和平、反对战争贩子的一切阴谋而奋斗。
    维多里奥继而论及总工会在十月的代表大会上提出解决失业的经济计划称：总工会发起的有著名经济学者及技术专家参加的全国经济会议，将在一月二十九日开幕，讨论这个计划的技术方面，然后作成议案提交议会。一九五○年将是总工会奋斗以实行其经济计划的一年。
