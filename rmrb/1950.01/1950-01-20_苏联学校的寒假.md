    Winter vacation in Soviet schools

    In Soviet schools, learning and rest are difficult to separate completely. The various learning, recreational, and sports activities during the winter vacation can greatly broaden students' horizons, promote the development of their talents, and arouse their interest in research and creation.

    On December 30th of last year, Soviet schools concluded the first semester of the 1949-1950 academic year and began the customary twelve-day winter vacation. A semester full of intense labor has passed. Soviet children have studied diligently and mastered knowledge. Now, the eagerly awaited days of vacation have arrived.

    During the winter vacation, how many fun, interesting, and captivating things await Soviet children! In the Palace of Young Pioneers, there are interesting forums on various issues, travel, sports competitions, outdoor games, skating, and skiing.

    The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government have always cared for the younger generation.

    This academic year, 36 million boys and girls and teenagers are studying in Soviet general schools, technical schools, and institutions of higher education. The Soviet Union has already implemented universal primary compulsory education. Every ethnic group in the Soviet Union conducts education in its own language. This year, the Soviet Union has taken a major step forward in its national education undertaking; it has implemented seven-year compulsory education not only in cities but also in rural areas.

    The achievements of Soviet national education are a testament to the ever-increasing power of the Soviet state. They demonstrate how much attention the Soviet government and the Bolshevik Party pay to national education and to educating young people in the spirit of communism!

    The great and truly historic achievements of the Soviet Union in national education make it clear that only under the socialist system can knowledge and culture become the property of the broad masses. At the same time, these achievements expose the hypocrisy of bourgeois propaganda that trumpets the so-called civilization of capitalist countries in various tones. Let those hired propagandists who eloquently tout the notorious "American way of life" try to explain why six million school-age children in the United States are deprived of the opportunity to study, and ten million children can only attend school for three to four months a year during the slack farming season?

    In Soviet schools, learning and rest are difficult to separate completely.

    The Soviet government shows exceptional concern for ensuring that students get adequate rest during the holidays.

    The Soviet Union allocates large sums of money to organize children's rest. No other country or government in the world cares about children's vacations as much as the Soviet Union. To mention just one thing, in the summer of 1949 alone, the state and various social organizations established 6,000 children's summer camps. 2.55 million students participated in summer camps, and another 550,000 children entered specialized children's sanatoriums.

    Soviet students have places to rest during the winter vacation, can spend it happily, and recharge their energy for the smooth progress of their studies in the next semester.

    In the Soviet Union, various children's extracurricular activity organizations are widely established. Palaces of Young Pioneers have been established in Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkov, Kiev, Saratov, Odessa, and many other major cities. In each Palace of Young Pioneers, there are rooms and halls that can accommodate many people, serving as well-equipped studios, libraries, reading rooms, laboratories, small factories, art rooms, and lecture rooms. Soviet students can find everything they want to study and observe during the winter vacation here.

    In the Soviet Union, any city or village, wherever there are schools and students, has Palaces of Young Pioneers, Children's Palaces of Culture, children's rooms, and children's parks. Here, Soviet students can read good books, hear interesting lectures, see captivating movies, and play all kinds of games during the holidays. Singing and music, ballroom dancing and dance, crafts and sculpture—everything students need can be found in the Children's Palace.

    In many cities in the Soviet Union, there are children's theaters that specialize in performing plays for children of all ages. Soviet students love theater, and they will not miss a new play during the winter vacation. All Soviet cinemas show several children's films a day during the holidays, and the seats are always full of students.

    Some children often want to take short trips or visits during the winter vacation. They can find good guides at the children's excursion and sightseeing stations in any city in the Soviet Union, who can tell them about the region's construction and attractions, and show them cultural relics, artistic treasures, and the unique natural scenery of the frontier.

    Naturally, most of the winter vacation is spent outdoors. They will skate and ski. All children in the Soviet Union love sports. In the numerous children's sports grounds, ski stations, and ice rinks in the Soviet Union, all the winter sports equipment needed is prepared for the students.

    In the Soviet Union, children's extracurricular activities are extensive and diverse. The study stations of Palaces of Young Pioneers, young technicians, and young natural scientists; children's excursion and sightseeing stations; children's railways; children's parks; children's libraries; children's theaters and cinemas; children's sports schools; art education centers; and organizations such as the Soviet Children's Film Studio and the Children's Book Publishing Bureau, and the publishing network of children's newspapers and magazines, all these hundreds and thousands of agencies, organizations, and publishing bureaus serve the diverse interests, needs, and creative desires of Soviet children. Soviet schools attach great importance to extracurricular activities during the winter vacation. Various groups and lectures are set up within the school, wall newspapers and handwritten magazines are published, reader forums, academic discussions, evening parties, current affairs reports are held, and visits, trips, and collective theater viewing are organized.

    The extracurricular and extracurricular activities in Soviet schools during the winter vacation are of great significance. Such activities can greatly broaden children's horizons, promote the full development of their talents, promote creativity, arouse children's interest in research and creation, and exercise and strengthen their physique.

    The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government treat the younger generation with special sensitivity and care, paying special attention to maintaining their health and strengthening their physical and intellectual strength. In the Soviet Union, caring for children, caring for their cultivation and education, is a national and nationwide undertaking. Many departments and bureaus of the country, many social organizations, and the entire Soviet people participate in organizing children's winter vacation rest. This is why Soviet students have unlimited possibilities to spend their vacations rationally and healthily.

    Soviet students benefit greatly from spending their winter vacations. They exercise and strengthen themselves, and enter the next semester with new strength, with the expectation of achieving excellent results in the 1949-1950 academic year.

    苏联学校的寒假
    苏联学校里的学习与休息，是很难断然分开的。寒假期间的各项学习、文娱、体育活动，可以大大开拓学生的眼界，促进他们才能的发展，唤起他们对研究和创造的兴趣。
    在上年十二月三十日，苏联学校已经结束了一九四九年——一九五○年这一学年的上学期，开始了照例的十二日的寒假。充满紧张劳动的一学期过去了。苏联儿童勤奋地学习了，掌握了知识。现在，热望的休假日子来到了。
    在寒假里，有多少好玩有趣、吸人心目的事情等待着苏联的孩子啊！少年宫里有关于各种问题的有趣座谈会、有旅行、有体育比赛、有露天游戏、有滑冰和滑雪。
    布尔什维克党和苏联政府一贯是关心后一代的。
    本学年在苏联普通学校、技术学校及高等学校里学习的有三千六百万名男女儿童和少年。苏联业已实行初级普及义务教育。苏联每个民族都用本民族语言进行教育。今年在苏联的国民教育事业上向前迈进了一大步；不仅在城市，而且在乡村也实行了七年制的义务教育。
    苏联国民教育的成绩是苏维埃国家日益增长的威力的明证。它们说明了苏联政府和布尔什维克党对于国民教育事业、对于用共产主义精神教育青少年，是多么特别注意啊！
    苏联在国民教育上伟大的、真正具有历史意义的成就，使人清楚地看出了只有在社会主义制度的条件下，知识、文化才能成为广大群众的财产。同时，这些成就也暴露了用各种腔调鼓吹所谓资本主义国家文明的资产阶级宣传的虚伪性。让那些花言巧语地吹嘘臭名昭著的“美国生活方式”的雇佣宣传家试来解释一下吧，为什么在美国有六百万学龄儿童被剥夺掉学习的可能，有一千万儿童一年之中只能在农闲时上学三——四个月呢？
    苏联学校里的学习与休息是很难断然分开的。
    苏联政府对于保证学生在假期里得到良好的休息这件事，表现异常关心。
    苏联拨出大批资金用于组织儿童休息。世界上再没有一个国家和政府能像苏联那样地关心儿童休假了。光说一件事吧，只一九四九年夏天，国家和各社会团体就设立了六千儿童夏令营。有二百五十五万名学生参加了夏令营，还有五十五万名儿童进入专设的儿童疗养院。
    苏联学生在寒假里有可供休憩的场所，可以愉快地渡过寒假，养精蓄锐以待下学期顺利进行学习。
    在苏联，广大普遍地建立着各种儿童校外活动机关，莫斯科、列宁格勒、哈尔科夫、基辅、萨拉托夫、敖德萨和许多其他大城市都设立着少年宫。在每所少年宫里都有可以容纳许多人的房间和大厅，充做应有尽有的各种研究室、图书馆、阅览室、化验室、小工厂、美术室和讲室。苏联学生在这里可以找到他在寒假中所要研究观摩的一切。
    在苏联，任何城市和乡村，只要是有学校和学生的地方，就有少年宫、儿童文化宫、儿童室和儿童公园。在这里，苏联学生可以在假期中读到好的书，听到有趣的讲座，看到吸引人的电影，做各种各样的游戏。歌咏和音乐，伴舞和舞蹈，工艺和雕塑——学生们所需要的一切都可以在儿童宫里找到。
    在苏联许多城市中有儿童戏院，专给各种年岁的儿童演戏。苏联学生很爱好戏剧，他们在寒假里不会放过一个新戏。苏联一切电影院，在假期中一天都要演几场儿童电影，座位总是被学生坐得满满的。
    有的孩子常常愿在寒假里作短距离的旅行或参观。他们可以在苏联任何城市中的儿童参观游览站里找到好向导，能够对他们讲述该地区的建设和名胜，使他们看到文化古迹、艺术宝藏和边疆的特殊自然风光。
    自然，寒假的大部分时间是在户外消磨的。他们将要滑冰、滑雪。苏联一切儿童都喜欢体育。在苏联数量很多的儿童运动场、滑雪站和溜冰场里，给学生们准备了冬季所需的一切体育设备。
    在苏联，儿童的校外活动是规模广泛和形式多样的。少年宫、少年技师和少年自然科学家的研究站、儿童参观游览站、儿童铁路、儿童公园、儿童图书馆、儿童戏院和电影院、儿童体育学校、艺术教育馆、以及苏联儿童电影制片厂和儿童图书出版局这类组织、儿童报纸杂志的出版网，成千成百的这一切机关、组织和出版局都是为着苏联儿童各种各样的利益、需要和创造欲而服务的。苏联学校对于寒假课外活动很重视。校内设立各种团体、讲座，出版墙报、手写杂志，举行读者座谈会、学术讨论会、晚会、时事报告，组织参观、旅行、集体看戏等等。
    苏联学校在寒假中的校外活动和课外活动意义是很重大的。这种活动可以大大开拓儿童的眼界，促进他们的才能充分发展，发扬创造性，唤起儿童对研究和创造的兴趣，并锻炼和加强他们的体格。
    布尔什维克党和苏维埃政府以特别的敏感和关怀对待后一代，特别注意保持他们的健康和加强他们的体力和智力。在苏联，关心孩子，关心他们的培养和教育，乃是全国性和全民性的事业。国家的许多部和局、许多社会团体、全体苏联人民都参加组织儿童寒假休息的工作。这就是苏联学生可以有无限可能来理智地和有益健康地消磨假期的原因所在。
    苏联学生在过寒假中得到莫大的益处，他们锻炼和加强了自己，以新的力量进入下学期，以期在一九四九——一九五○这一学年中获得优异的成绩。
