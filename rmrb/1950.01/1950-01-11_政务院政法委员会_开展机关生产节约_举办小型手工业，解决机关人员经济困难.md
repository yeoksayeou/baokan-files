    The State Council's Political and Legal Affairs Committee
    Launches Production and Thrift Campaign
    Establishes Small-Scale Handicraft Industry to Solve Economic Difficulties of Staff
    [This newspaper reports] To appropriately adjust the economic life of staff and overcome difficulties, the leadership of the State Council's Political and Legal Affairs Committee has proposed launching a production and thrift campaign within the organization as the central task for the spring. After conducting study and performance evaluations before the new year, all personnel are responding to this call from the leadership with renewed enthusiasm. Preparations are underway to establish an organizational consumer cooperative within the political and legal system to address the supply of essential daily necessities for general staff and workers. At the same time, production initiatives are being actively planned, initially focusing on operating organizational handicrafts. A sewing department has already been established, and preparations are being made for a small-scale mill and sauce garden, organizing cadres' family members and absorbing the surplus labor and financial resources of organizational personnel for investment in production.
    Currently, emphasis is first placed on practicing strict economy. An inspection by the administrative office has resulted in a 32% reduction in the number of newspaper subscriptions without compromising work or study needs. This will save approximately 360 jin of millet in subscription fees each month. With everyone's consent, and without impeding work, 47 telephones have been removed, saving 906 jin of millet each month. These two items alone will save over 1,270 jin of millet in expenses each month. Inspections are now being carried out in various areas such as warehouses, medicine, support staff numbers, stoves, light bulbs, bicycles, office supplies, cars, and gasoline, to overcome wasteful phenomena. In accordance with the principle of streamlining, the organization's administrative management work will continue to be improved.

    政务院政法委员会
    开展机关生产节约
    举办小型手工业，解决机关人员经济困难
    【本报讯】政务院政法委员会为适当调节机关人员经济生活，克服困难，领导上已提出开展机关生产节约作为春季机关工作中心。全体人员在年前进行学习及考绩以后，正以新的积极情绪响应领导上这一号召，现正筹设政法系统的机关消费合作社，解决一般职员工人的主要生活必需品的供应。同时积极筹办生产事业，暂集中力量经营机关手工业，已成立一个缝纫部，还准备搞小型磨房及酱园，组织干部家属并吸收机关人员有余的劳力和财力投入生产。
    目前首先强调厉行节约。经行政处检查结果，刻已将订阅报纸份数，减少百分之三十二，并不损害工作和学习需要。每月可节省订报费约合小米三百六十余斤。电话机在不妨碍工作原则下，经大家同意，已撤减四十七部，每月可节省九百零六斤米。仅以上两项每月即可节省经费一千二百七十余斤米。现正进行库房、医药、勤杂人员数目、火炉、灯泡、自行车、办公用具、汽车、汽油等各方面的检查，克服浪费现象，并根据精简原则继续改进机关行政管理工作。
