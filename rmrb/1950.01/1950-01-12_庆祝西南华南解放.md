    Celebrating the Liberation of Southwest and South China
    Shortly after the liberation of Guangzhou, the Second Field Army, Fourth Field Army, and a portion of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army launched the Southwest Campaign and the Guangxi-Guangdong Campaign in early November. In less than two months, they advanced thousands of miles, liberating the entire provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Guangdong, annihilating the main forces of the Kuomintang bandit armies, the Bai Chongxi and Hu Zongnan groups, and eliminating 600,000 enemy troops. Under the rapid and victorious advance of the powerful People's Liberation Army, Generals Lu Han, Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, and Pan Wenhua declared their uprising, and the provinces of Yunnan and Xikang were peacefully liberated. By this point, the Chinese mainland, except for Tibet, had been completely liberated, the remaining enemies had been largely eliminated, and the liberation war on the mainland had basically ended, allowing for an early transition to peaceful construction. We extend our highest respect and regards to all the soldiers who liberated Southwest and South China, and to the compatriots in the South who directly supported these two major campaigns.
    The liberation of Southwest and South China and the annihilation of the Bai Chongxi and Hu Zongnan bandit armies shattered the dreams of international imperialism and domestic reactionaries to stubbornly resist on the Chinese mainland, prolong the war, and wait for the outbreak of a third world war, in order to stage a comeback. The Bai and Hu bandit armies were the enemy's only remaining main force corps and had always been regarded by the imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits as their last trump card, providing spiritual and material support for the remaining Kuomintang forces. American imperialism paid particular attention to these two forces and had continuously supplied the Bai and Hu bandits directly with military supplies. After the reactionary rule in Nanjing was declared to be destroyed, Chinese and foreign reactionaries decided to concentrate the forces of these two groups in Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan, backed by the imperialist colonies and vassal states in Asia, and obtain maritime supplies, continue to struggle in Southwest and South China, and maintain a base of operations on the Chinese mainland, as capital for international adventures in the future. However, under the brave pursuit of the People's Liberation Army, the Bai and Hu bandit groups were quickly eliminated. The counter-revolutionary plan of the imperialists and their running dogs was declared bankrupt. At the same time, this victory also created favorable preconditions for the liberation of Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet. Because the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army will be able to concentrate their efforts to prepare for cross-sea operations and the liberation of Tibet. On the enemy's side, the situation is even more isolated. Currently, the enemy's regular troops on the four islands of Taiwan, Hainan Island, Kinmen, and Zhoushan total less than 350,000, and including irregular troops, logistics personnel, and the navy and air force, there are only about 580,000, a very weak force. They originally hoped to withdraw a portion of their main force from the mainland to strengthen the resistance on the islands, but as a result, apart from a small number of defeated and demoralized remnants who fled there, the rest were wiped out on the mainland. Therefore, the fate of the remaining bandits on the islands will not be long.
    In this Southwest and Guangxi-Guangdong campaign, a very significant feature was the rapid disintegration of the Kuomintang bandit army. A large number of Kuomintang officers and soldiers revolted or surrendered to the People's Liberation Army. This is due to the unparalleled strength of the Chinese people, the already established overall victory of the revolution, and the excellent political facilities of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, which have won the hearts of the people. Many officials and soldiers of the Kuomintang reactionary government and reactionary army have begun to realize that any resistance today is useless, and that returning to the people is the only bright path. This should be a very beneficial education for the remaining enemies on the islands and the Kuomintang bandits and secret agents remaining on the Chinese mainland.
    The rapid liberation of Southwest and South China and the early basic end of the war on the mainland greatly facilitated China's future recovery work. The Kuomintang bandits, seeing that they could no longer stand on the mainland, formulated a criminal plan to carry out large-scale killings and destruction, in order to deepen the wounds of the people and make China's economic recovery difficult. The ferocious enemy frantically slaughtered thousands of patriotic compatriots in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places, and blew up the Yuehan Railway, Xianggui Railway, Xiangqian Railway, and important constructions in many cities. However, due to the rapid advance of the People's Liberation Army, which often traveled day and night to rescue cities and important constructions, coupled with the efforts of employees of various agencies and enterprises to protect them, most of the enemy's sabotage plans could not be realized, reducing the losses of the state and the people. After the liberation of Chongqing, Guilin, Guiyang, and other places, water and land transportation was quickly restored, which promoted the exchange of materials between the north and the south, and the east and the west, and will accelerate the development of economic construction work.
    The liberation of Southwest and South China and the elimination of the Kuomintang bandit army on the Chinese mainland is a major event worthy of warm celebration. However, the war on the mainland has just passed, Kuomintang bandits and secret agents are carrying out various sabotage activities everywhere, and Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet have yet to be liberated. There is still much work to be done before us. It is hoped that the people of Southwest and South China, under the leadership of the People's Government, will actively support the People's Liberation Army, quickly establish and consolidate the land defense, eliminate secret agents and bandits, establish revolutionary order, sort out finances and taxes, restore production, and pave the way for building a new Southwest and a new South China.

### 庆祝西南华南解放

    庆祝西南华南解放
    广州解放以后不久，人民解放军第二野战军第四野战军及第一野战军一部即于十一月初先后发动了西南战役和桂粤战役。不到两个月的时间，进军数千里，解放了川、黔、桂、粤四省全境，歼灭国民党匪军主力白崇禧、胡宗南两个集团，消灭敌人达六十万人。在强大的人民解放军迅速地胜利进军下，卢汉、刘文辉、邓锡侯、潘文华等将军宣布起义，云南、西康两省得到和平解放。至此，中国大陆除西藏外已完全解放，残敌大体全部肃清，大陆上的解放战争基本上结束，可以早日转入和平建设。我们谨向解放西南、华南的全线将士，和直接支援这两大战役的南方同胞，敬致崇高的敬礼和慰问。
    西南、华南的解放和白崇禧、胡宗南匪军的消灭，粉碎了国际帝国主义和国内反动派企图在中国大陆上进行顽抗，拖延战争时间，等待第三次世界大战爆发，以便卷土重来的迷梦。白胡匪军是敌人仅存的两个主力兵团，向来被帝国主义和国民党匪帮目为最后的王牌，对于国民党残余势力起着精神上和实力上的支持作用。美国帝国主义对于这两支力量尤为重视，曾经不断地以军火直接接济白胡两匪。在南京反动统治宣告灭亡以后，中外反动派便决定将这两个集团的兵力调集粤桂黔滇，背靠帝国主义在亚洲的殖民地和附庸国，取得海陆接济，在西南、华南继续挣扎，保持中国大陆上的作战基地，以为来日国际冒险的资本。但在人民解放军奋勇追击之下，白胡两匪部迅速消灭。帝国主义及其走狗的反革命计划宣告破产。同时，这一胜利，也给解放台湾、海南岛、西藏创造了有利的前提。因为中国人民和人民解放军今后更能集中力量准备渡海作战和解放西藏。而在敌人方面，形势更加孤立。现在台湾、海南岛、金门、舟山四岛之敌正规军合共不到三十五万人，连同非正规军、后勤人员和海空军在内，总共也只有五十八万人左右，力量十分单薄。他们原来希冀由陆上撤出一部分主力，以增强海岛的抵抗力量，但结果除了少数溃不成军的残兵败将逃亡过去以外，其余均已在大陆被一网打尽。所以，海岛残匪的命运已经不会很长了。
    在这次西南、桂粤两大战役中，一个十分显著的特点，是国民党匪军迅速地土崩瓦解。大批的国民党军官兵，在人民解放军面前，纷纷起义或投降。这是由于中国人民力量无比强大，革命胜利的大局业已底定，以及中国共产党和人民政府的优良的政治设施使人心归向的原故。国民党反动政府和反动军队的许多官员和士兵，已经开始认识到今天任何反抗都是没有用的，只有归向人民才是唯一的光明出路。这对于海岛残敌以及残存在中国大陆上的国民党土匪特务，应该是一种很有益的教育。
    西南、华南地区的迅速解放，大陆战事的提早基本结束，大大地便利了中国今后的恢复工作。国民党残匪眼看自己已经无法在陆上立足，便制订一项罪恶计划，企图进行大规模的屠杀和破坏，以加深人民的创伤，使中国的经济事业难能恢复。凶恶的敌人，在重庆、成都等地疯狂地屠杀了上千爱国同胞，并将粤汉路、湘桂路、湘黔路和许多城市的重要建设炸毁。但是，由于人民解放军的神速进军，往往为了抢救城市和重要建设而昼夜兼程，加上各机关、企业员工的努力保护，使敌人的破坏计划大部分无法实现，减少了国家和人民的损失。在重庆、桂林、贵阳等地解放后，水陆交通迅速恢复，这便促进了南北东西的物资交流，将可加速经济建设工作的开展。
    西南、华南解放了，中国大陆上的国民党匪军消灭了，这是值得热烈庆祝的大事。但是，大陆战事刚才过去，流窜各地的国民党土匪特务正在进行各种破坏活动，台湾、海南岛、西藏尚待解放，我们面前有许多工作要做。希望西南、华南人民，在人民政府的领导下，积极地支援人民解放军，迅速地建立和巩固陆上国防；肃清特务土匪，建立革命秩序，整理财政税收，恢复生产事业，铺平建设新西南、新华南的道路。
