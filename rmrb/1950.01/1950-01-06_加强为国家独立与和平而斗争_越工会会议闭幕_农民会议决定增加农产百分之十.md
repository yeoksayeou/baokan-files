Workers of both sexes throughout Vietnam donated 7 million Vietnamese currency to support the army, and they helped the people harvest 648,000 hectares of rice fields. Workers in South Vietnam destroyed nearly 15,000 hectares of French rubber plantations in the French-occupied areas, burned 25,000 tons of rubber, attacked 15 cities, blew up nearly 300 bridges, 100 locomotives, and 4,613 carriages, and dismantled 2,200 kilometers of rails.

The conference discussed the following tasks to be completed in 1950: establishing the Farmers' Warriors Alliance for Liberation and agricultural cooperatives; increasing agricultural production by at least 10 percent in 1950; and completing rent reduction and income tax reduction.

President Ho Chi Minh sent a letter to the conference stating: Farmers account for the majority of the Vietnamese population, representing a huge force that occupies an extremely important position in the national liberation struggle. He called on the conference to unite all farmers, especially to unite middle and poor peasants into a strong alliance, to advance the war against the French aggressors and national construction.
