    Lang Tao Sha Ling
    Yu Pingbo
    Written on New Year's Day, 1950
    In ancient Youzhou and Yan territory, the nation opens, a beautiful scene unprecedented. Red lanterns lower the flags, their shadows dancing, hundreds of millions of people look up in unison, a round moon, a New Year.

    Looking back at Jinggang Mountain, the revolution was arduous. The remaining bandits east of the sea are still stubborn. Spring flourishes on the mainland, shared by Europe and Asia, clear snow, a New Year.

    浪淘沙令
    俞平伯
    一九五○年元日作开国古幽燕，佳景空前。红灯降帜影蹁跹，亿兆人民同仰看，圆月新年。
    回首井岗山，革命艰难。海东残寇尚冥顽。大陆春生欧亚共，晴雪新年。
