    Promoting Urban-Rural Material Exchange and Developing Production
    Beijing Cooperative Depot Handles Purchasing and Sales on Commission
    Transaction Value Reaches 4.2 Billion in One and a Half Months

    [Report from this newspaper] After the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative's depot, it immediately established contact with cooperative organizations in various regions, enabling business to develop rapidly and achieving considerable success in promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. This depot was rebuilt from the Farmer's Hostel according to the instructions of the North China Cooperative Headquarters. It opened on December 1st of last year at the original site of the Farmer's Hostel on Langfang Er Tiao in Beijing, operating businesses such as commissioned sales, commissioned purchases, storage, and transportation. By January 18th, the total transaction value through the depot reached over 4.2 billion yuan. Forty-five cooperative units in regions such as East China, Northeast China, Northwest China, and provinces and cities such as Shanxi, Pingyuan, and Hebei have established business relationships, including the Tianjin, Baoding, and Dingxian special district cooperatives, the Suiyuan and Chahar provincial cooperatives, the Datong, Zhangjiakou, and Qinhuangdao city cooperatives, and the Huairou, Si Hai, Dingxing, Guan, and Xincheng county cooperatives, all of which have regular dealings with the depot. In one and a half months, the goods shipped to Beijing by cooperatives from various regions for consignment sales through the depot included over 722,200 jin of millet, 2,042,900 jin of wheat, and 252,200 jin of miscellaneous grains, plus peanuts, horsetail and other items, with a total value of over 1.7 billion yuan. Industrial products commissioned by cooperatives from various regions to be purchased in Beijing by the depot included 1,690 bolts of cotton cloth (mainly city cloth), 1,540 bolts of homespun cloth, 300 bundles of cotton yarn, 4,419 barrels of kerosene, 1,439 jin of white sugar and brown sugar, 414 bags of soda ash, and 16,200 jin of fertilizer, 13,164 bags of flour, plus cotton textiles, daily necessities, paper, stationery, hardware, and other items, with a total value of over 2.51542 billion yuan. In addition to the consignment sales and purchasing businesses, the storage and transportation businesses have also developed considerably. More than half of the industrial products purchased in Beijing by cooperatives from various regions had their transportation procedures handled by the cooperative depot. The reason is that the handling fees of the depot are lower than those of private merchants, allowing cooperatives to save a lot of money.
