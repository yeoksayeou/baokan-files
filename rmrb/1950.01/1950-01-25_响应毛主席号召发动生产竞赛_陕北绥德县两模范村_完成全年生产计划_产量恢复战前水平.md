Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 24th: Two model production villages in Suide County, Northern Shaanxi – Wangjiaping and Shanbaishu Village – have victoriously completed their annual production plans for 1949. The agricultural production of these two villages has been restored to pre-war levels. Wangjiaping Village is a natural village in the Sanxiang area of Jizhen District, Suide County. Before the revolution, the entire village had only twenty or thirty peasant households cultivating over 400 *mu* of land, of which over 300 *mu* were rented, resulting in low peasant morale. Since the establishment of the new government in 1940, through struggles such as rent reduction, interest reduction, and land redemption, most of the land seized by landlords in the village has been returned to the peasants, greatly boosting peasant morale. Subsequently, after several years of the Great Production Movement, under the leadership of Wang Debiao, a special-class labor hero in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the peasants of the entire village gradually achieved food and clothing security. In the spring of 1944, the village was selected as a model village in Suide County. In 1947, due to the invasion of the bandit Hu (referring to the Kuomintang army), the village suffered significant losses, with over half of its draft animals lost and the number of peasants decreasing by about 30% compared to 1946. Shanbaishu Village is a newly emerging model village in Suide County, which also suffered severe damage during the bandit Hu's invasion. Last spring, in response to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production by an inch" and strive to restore pre-war production levels within a year, the peasants of the two villages launched a production emulation drive. Shanbaishu Village first put forward the slogan "Learn from the Model Village Wangjiaping," set annual production plans, demanded an increase of four and a half *sheng* of refined grain per *mu*, challenged Wangjiaping, and learned from Wangjiaping's experience in mutual aid through labor exchange. Wangjiaping Village, focusing on learning Shanbaishu Village's farming methods, also set annual production plans. During the production emulation process, Communist Party members in the two villages united with other production activists to form a leading core, checking and urging at any time in accordance with the production season and plan, and frequently convening meetings of villagers, cadres, and Party members to discuss and resolve difficulties in production, and using meetings to explain current events and policies to the masses to encourage mass production enthusiasm. After a year of hard work, the peasants of the two villages have victoriously completed their annual production emulation plans. The specific achievements of the two villages' annual production are detailed below:

            Wangjiaping Village
    Wangjiaping Village: In terms of agricultural production: All work was done in accordance with the seasons and with intensive cultivation. Of the 396 *mu* of autumn fields in the whole village, three-quarters were hoed four times and one-quarter were hoed three times; 149 *mu* of land were all plowed twice before sowing. At the same time, general practices such as terracing, digging field ridges, and building water cellars were implemented to improve farming. Therefore, although the harvest in the Suide district was generally poor last year, the village was able to harvest an average of over six *dou* (30 *jin* per *dou*) of coarse grain per *mu*. The public granary now stores five *shi* and seven *dou* and six *sheng* of black beans and 2,000 *jin* of public firewood. In terms of sideline production: 30 spinning women have spun 374 *jin* of cotton (original plan was 450 *jin*) and woven 673.2 *zhang* of cloth (original plan was 810 *zhang*). Although the above two items have not completed the original plan, it can be guaranteed that they will be completed before the Spring Festival. The transportation team organized by three donkeys in the whole village originally planned to earn two *shi* of millet, but has now earned five *shi* and one *dou* and three *sheng* of millet. In addition, 100 trees were planted and 2,230 *amorpha fruticosa* saplings were planted, exceeding the original plan by more than 700 saplings. In terms of medicine: Grain from the public granary was used to buy medicines for treating malaria and eye diseases, etc. Those who are ill can borrow it first and return the grain in the autumn. 18 patients have been cured, reducing man-hours lost. In terms of culture and education: A primary school that was suspended during the invasion of the Hu Zongnan bandit army was restored, with 17 students; After the autumn harvest, night schools and women's literacy classes were also established, with a total of 33 young people and women participating; Two blackboard bulletins were set up, and current affairs or production news were published once every half month. The 38 peasant households in the whole village have basically recovered to their pre-war living standards, and 10 households still have surplus grain.

            Shanbaishu Village
    Shanbaishu Village: First, it learned from Wangjiaping's method of mutual aid through labor exchange, and mobilized 33 of the 34 laborers in the village to participate in labor exchange teams. From spring plowing and summer weeding to autumn harvesting, the labor exchange team not only completed the task of agricultural production, but also extracted two laborers to work in Yan'an and Ganquan area, earning 66 *jin* of cotton. In terms of agricultural production: all 412 *mu* of autumn fields in the village were plowed twice: 52 *mu* of autumn crops were hoed three times, 231 *mu* were hoed four times, and 49 *mu* were hoed five times; The average yield of coarse grain per *mu* was over seven *dou*. In terms of sideline production: 46 spinning women have spun 460 *jin* of yarn, exceeding the original plan by 60 *jin*; 810 *zhang* of cloth were woven, exceeding the original plan by 90 *zhang*; 30 pigs were raised, exceeding the original plan by 22; 152 straw hats were woven, exceeding the original plan by 52. 2,500 *amorpha fruticosa* saplings were planted, exceeding the original plan by 500 saplings. In terms of public granary and cooperative undertakings: The public granary originally stored one *shi* of millet, which was lent to peasants at low interest in the spring to solve difficulties in seed and food grain. Now, one *dou* and seven *sheng* of millet are stored, and one *dou* of medicine is purchased to treat villagers and vaccinate children. Cooperative undertakings: In August, villagers collected two *shi* and two *dou* of millet to buy 10 *jin* of dyes in Suide, which was five *dou* of millet cheaper than in the market town. After the autumn harvest, 28 peasant households collected six *shi* and two *dou* of grain to open a flour mill, which is expected to earn two *shi* of millet by the end of the old lunar year. In terms of culture and education: A primary school was established with 73 students; The school has a literacy group with 12 participants, who read the newspaper once every three days. At present, the area of cultivated land and grain output in the whole village have basically recovered to pre-war levels.

            Reasons for achievements:
    (1) Launch emulation, increase enthusiasm; (2) Both have a core of production leadership; (3) Organize mutual aid through labor exchange; (4) Check, urge, and deploy work at any time; (5) Establish a public granary to solve difficulties.
    The basic reasons for the above achievements in the production of the two villages are: (1) The two villages responded to Chairman Mao's call to launch a production emulation drive, and the enthusiasm of the masses for production was greatly improved. (2) Both villages have a core of production leadership headed by Communist Party members and village cadres and uniting other activists. (3) Under the environment of a scattered and individual small-scale peasant economy, mutual aid through labor exchange was organized based on the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit. (4) Check, urge and deploy work at any time according to the plan. For example, Wangjiaping held 16 meetings of villagers, cadres, and Party groups throughout the year to discuss and check production work. When there was a drought in April last year, the village immediately started to prevent drought and prepare for famine; When the weather changed abruptly in May, it immediately organized a hail prevention team and a health committee. Because things were arranged in advance, the peasants were able to produce with peace of mind. (5) Establishing a public granary to solve the difficulties of peasants lacking seeds, food, medicine, etc. The shortcomings in the production emulation of the two villages are: they did not maintain close contact with each other often enough, so they failed to learn from each other and supervise each other in a timely manner; Secondly, the district and township governments did not pay due attention to the emulation of the two model villages, and actively helped the two villages to carry out production better, and learned from the experience to promote other villages.

    响应毛主席号召发动生产竞赛
    陕北绥德县两模范村 
    完成全年生产计划
    产量恢复战前水平
    【新华社西安二十四日电】陕北绥德县两个生产模范村——王家坪和山柏树村已胜利完成一九四九年全年的生产计划，该两村的农业生产已恢复到战前水平。王家坪村是绥德县吉镇区三乡的一个自然村，革命前全村二、三十户农民，种地四百多垧，其中三百多垧是租来的，农民生产情绪很低。自一九四零年新政权建立后，经过减租减息、回赎土地等斗争，该村农民为地主霸占的土地已大部转回农民手中，因此农民的生产情绪大大提高。以后，经过几年的大生产运动，全村农民在陕甘宁边区特等劳动英雄王德彪领导下，逐渐做到丰衣足食。一九四四年春该村被选为绥德县的模范村。一九四七年由于胡匪的侵犯，该村受到很大损失，耕畜减少一半以上，农民较一九四六年减少百分之三十左右。山柏树村是绥德县一个新起的模范村，在胡匪进犯时，也遭受严重的破坏。去年春天两村农民为响应毛主席“生产长一寸”的号召，和争取一年恢复战前生产水平，发起了生产竞赛。山柏树村首先提出“向模范村王家坪看齐”的口号，订出全年生产计划，要求每垧增产细粮四升半，向王家坪挑战，学习王家坪变工合作经验。王家坪村以学习山柏树村农作方法为中心，也订出全年生产计划。在生产竞赛过程中，两村共产党员团结其他生产积极分子，组成领导核心，根据生产季节和计划随时检查、督促，并经常召开村民、干部、党员等会议，研讨和解决生产中的困难问题，并利用会议向群众讲解时事和政策，鼓舞群众生产情绪。两村农民经过一年来的努力生产，已胜利完成全年生产竞赛的计划。现将两村全年生产的具体成绩分述如下：
            王家坪村
    王家坪村：农业生产方面：做到全部不违农时和精耕细作。全村秋田共三百九十六垧，其中锄四次的占四分之三，锄三次的四分之一；一百四十九垧地，播种时全部翻过二次。同时普遍做到了溜崖、掏畔、打水窖等，提高了作务。因此，虽然去年绥德分区一带一般收成不好，但该村每垧地平均能收到六斗（每斗三十斤）粗粮以上。义仓现存粮食有黑豆五石七斗六升，公柴两千斤。副业生产方面：三十个纺妇已纺花三百七十四斤（原计划四百五十斤），织布六百七十三丈二尺（原计划八百一十丈）。上述两项，虽未完成原订计划，但可保证于春节前全部完成。全村抽出三头毛驴组织的运输小组，原计划赚小米两石，现已赚小米五石一斗三升。此外还植树一百株，种柠条两千二百三十株，超过原计划七百余株。医药方面：以义仓粮买回医治疟疾、眼病等药品，有病者可先借用，秋后还粮。已治好病人十八名，减少了误工时间。文教方面：恢复了胡宗南匪军进犯时停办的一处小学，现有学生十七人；秋收后并成立了夜校和妇女识字班，参加的青年和妇女共三十三人；办黑板报二处，半月刊一次时事或生产消息。全村三十八户农民，现已基本上恢复了战前的生活水平，十户尚有余粮。
            山柏树村
    山柏树村：首先学习了王家坪变工互助的办法，发动全村三十四个劳动力中的三十三个人参加了变工队。变工队从春耕、夏耘到秋收，不仅完成了农业生产的任务，并抽出了两个劳动力到延安、甘泉一带揽工，赚回棉花六十六斤。农业生产方面：全村四百一十二垧土地的秋田全部翻两次：秋禾锄三次的五十二垧，锄四次的二百三十一垧，锄五次的四十九垧；每垧平均产粗粮七斗以上。副业生产方面：四十六个纺妇已纺线四百六十斤，超过原计划六十斤；织布八百一十丈，超过原计划九十丈；养猪三十只，超过原计划二十二只；编草帽一百五十二顶，超过原计划五十二顶。种柠条二千五百株，超过原计划五百株。义仓及合作事业方面：义仓原存小米一石，春季以低利贷给农民解决籽种、食粮困难。现存小米一斗七升，并以一斗购药给村人医病，给小孩种牛痘。合作事业：八月在村人中集股小米两石二斗，至绥德买染料十斤，较集镇便宜小米五斗。秋后又由二十八户农民集粮六石二斗，开办粉房一座，预计到旧历年底可赚小米二石。文教方面：兴办小学一所，学生七十三人；该校附设识字组有十二人参加，每三天读报一次。现全村耕地面积、粮食产量均已基本恢复到战前水平。
            获得成绩的原因：
    （一）发动竞赛，提高积极性；（二）都有生产领导核心；（三）组织变工互助；（四）随时检查、督促、布置工作；（五）成立义仓，解决困难。
    两村生产获致上述成绩的基本原因是：（１）两村响应毛主席号召，发动生产竞赛，群众生产积极性大为提高。（２）两村都有以共产党员和村干部为首并团结其他积极分子的生产领导核心。（３）在分散的、个体的小农经济的环境下，根据自愿两利原则组织了变工互助。（４）根据计划随时检查、督促和布置工作。如王家坪全年召开过十六次村民、干部、党小组会，讨论、检查生产工作。去年四月天旱时，该村马上着手防旱备荒；五月天气骤变，又立即组织防雹小组和卫生委员会。由于遇事事先布置，所以能使农民安心无虑地生产。（５）成立义仓，解决农民缺乏籽种、食粮、医药等困难。两村生产竞赛中的缺点是：彼此经常取得密切联系不够，因此未能及时地互相学习，互相督促；其次，当地区、乡政府对两个模范村的竞赛，没有给予应有的重视，积极帮助两村将生产进行得更好，并吸取经验，推动其他乡村。
