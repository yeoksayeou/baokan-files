The spokesperson of the China Democratic National Construction Association issued a statement protesting the Thai government's anti-Chinese atrocities. The statement said:

Thailand has the largest number of overseas Chinese, totaling more than four million. The Thai dictator, Luang Phibunsongkhram, before and during World War II, imitated Hitler's anti-Jewish tactics, constantly implementing anti-Chinese policies to deceive the Thai people and carry out his fascist rule. In 1948, when Luang Phibunsongkhram regained power, his anti-Chinese policies became even more intensified. In addition to continuing to restrict the entry of overseas Chinese, he also cruelly destroyed the education, press, and industrial and commercial enterprises of overseas Chinese, and inhumanly excluded the legitimate labor of overseas Chinese. As a result, 200,000 overseas Chinese children were deprived of education, and the lives of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese were on the verge of ruin.

The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War inspired unprecedented patriotism among overseas Chinese in Thailand. Overseas Chinese in Bangkok were illegally arrested, detained, and even beaten and poisoned by the Thai reactionary government for celebrating the birth of New China. Such extremely cruel and barbaric acts are not only intolerable to the Chinese people, but also opposed by the kind and peace-loving Thai people.

We fully support the solemn protest and demands made by Vice Foreign Minister Li of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Thai government regarding this incident. "Making every effort to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese" is enshrined in the Common Program. The People's Government will strictly implement this policy for overseas Chinese in any region. New China is different from colonial countries and will never seek any special privileges for the Chinese people abroad. However, it will strive for humane treatment for the Chinese people abroad and will not allow any country to discriminate against the Chinese people. This is the due responsibility of the government of an independent country and cannot be shirked. New China also provides "equal" protection to law-abiding foreigners in China.

It must be recalled that Luang Phibunsongkhram, before and during World War II, echoed Franco of Spain, playing an ugly role in the fascist camp, and he did even more vigorously than Franco. He once declared war on the United States and Britain. And now? This ugly character's re-emergence on the stage is precisely due to the support of American and British imperialism! This is a blatant manifestation of American and British imperialism abandoning its wartime promise to the Allies to jointly oppose fascism, and it just proves that American and British imperialism has completely replaced the fascist rule of Germany, Japan, and Italy at that time. Therefore, we must remember that the current disaster of overseas Chinese in Thailand is given by American and British imperialism. Without the direction of American and British imperialism in Thailand, there would be no revival of the Luang Phibunsongkhram reactionary regime, and there would be no disaster suffered by overseas Chinese today. Once the true strength of the Thai people rises, they and the overseas Chinese will surely be able to get along in harmony.

It must also be pointed out that the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past have always pretended to care about the anti-Chinese movement of the Thai reactionary regime, and have never taken effective action. In recent years, the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang have colluded with Luang Phibunsongkhram to jointly implement the poisonous plot of oppressing patriotic overseas Chinese.

From this, we can recognize that reactionaries are not only of the same origin, but will eventually converge. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the people's democratic and peaceful forces of the world to form a broad and strong front.

### 民主建国会发表声明  抗议泰政府排华暴行

    抗议泰政府排华暴行
    【北京讯】民主建国会发言人对泰国政府排华暴行，发表抗议的声明。声明称：
    泰国是华侨人数最多的地方，总数超过四百万人。泰国的独裁者銮披汶，在第二次大战以前和战争当中，就师法希特勒排犹的故智，不断的施行排华政策，以欺骗泰国人民，遂行其法西斯的统治。一九四八年銮披汶重握政权，排华政策变本加厉，除继续限制华侨入境外，并且更毒辣的摧残华侨的教育、新闻和工商事业，更灭绝人理的排斥华侨的正当劳动。因此使得二十万的侨童失学，数十万侨胞的生活，濒于绝境。
    中国人民解放战争的胜利，鼓舞了泰国华侨空前的忠爱祖国的热情。曼谷侨胞为了庆祝新中国的诞生，竟遭泰国反动政府的非法逮捕拘押，甚至殴打毒杀。这种极端残忍野蛮的暴行，不但中国人民难以容忍，善良的爱好和平的泰国人民也要加以反对。
    我外交部李副部长为此事件对泰国政府发出的严正抗议和要求，我们完全拥护。“尽力保护国外华侨的正当权益”，载在共同纲领。人民政府对于任何地方的华侨将严格执行这一政策。新中国与殖民国家不同，决不为中国人民争取在国外的任何特权。但为中国人民争取在国外的人的待遇，不容许任何国家对中国人民有所歧视。那是一个独立国家的政府应有的责任，是不能诿卸的。新中国对于在华的守法外侨，也是“一视同仁”的给予保护。
    必须追溯，銮披汶在第二次大战以前和作战期间，是和西班牙的佛郎哥遥遥相对，扮演着法西斯阵容当中的丑角的，他比佛郎哥做的更卖力。曾经对美英宣战。现在呢？这一名丑角的重新粉墨登场，正是受到美英帝国主义的支持！这正是美英帝国主义背弃其在战时对盟国所作的共同反对法西斯主义诺言的露骨表现，也正好证明美英帝国主义是完全代替了当时的德、日、意法西斯统治。因此，我们必须记着：目下泰国华侨的灾祸，正是美英帝国主义所给与的。没有美英帝国主义在泰国的导演，就不会有銮披汶反动政权的复活，也就不会有今天华侨所受的灾祸。一旦真正的泰国人民力量抬头，他们和华侨一定是可以和善相处的。
    还必须指出，国民党反动派过去对于泰国反动政权的排华运动，一向只是惺惺作态，从来也不曾采取有力的行动。近年以来，蒋匪帮残余更与銮披汶勾结，合力执行压迫爱国华侨的毒计。
    由此我们可以认清，反动派不但是同源，而且是终久要合流的。因此，全世界的人民民主和平力量要结成一条广泛而坚强的阵线，是绝对必要的。
