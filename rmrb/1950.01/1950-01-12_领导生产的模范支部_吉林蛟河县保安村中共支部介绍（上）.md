The Bao'an Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, has become a first-class model branch in the county by fully leading the masses in production after the land reform, transforming them from poverty to abundance. This branch has the following main characteristics in leading the masses in production:

            Characteristics of Leading Production

First, the branch can proactively propose production plans that are completely suitable for the actual situation, based on the environmental possibilities, the needs of the masses, and labor conditions. They do not simply transmit instructions from higher authorities or only create individual production plans for party members. Instead, they formulate production plans for the entire masses meticulously and appropriately, starting from the actual situation and the needs of all the villagers. For example, when celebrating the Lunar New Year in 1949, the branch discussed and formulated the entire spring plowing plan. Before the spring plowing was finished, they formulated the summer hoeing plan. The plan for sideline production during the summer and after hoeing was researched and developed by the branch when the first hoeing was underway. The branch made specific decisions on autumn harvest and winter sideline production in mid-September. They research the production plans for the next season one or two months in advance, so that each plan can be fully discussed, deliberated, and revised within and outside the party, making it more practical and meeting the needs of the masses. At the same time, party members and the masses can actively produce and complete each season's tasks ahead of schedule, so as to squeeze out time to strive for the next production plan, eliminating the blindness and procrastination of "not being in a hurry" in the production of the masses.
   Formulate and discuss production plans, attract the masses to participate in production; production plans are closely integrated with the organization of labor.

Second, the branch can combine agricultural and sideline production closely according to seasonal environment in leading production, based on the characteristics of the village where land is scarce and the population is large (an average of 3.8 mu of land per person, and 2.2 mu of land per labor force), solving the problem of using surplus labor. For example, when discussing the summer hoeing plan, the branch calculated that the village had surplus labor and livestock, so the party members took the lead in leading some of the masses to the mountains to pull wood. When the first hoeing was underway, party members Chi Dianwen (village vice chairman) and Zhang Jichen led six people and four carts to pull wood. By the time of the second hoeing, it had increased to thirteen carts and twenty-six people. By September 15th, each cart earned up to more than 35 million (Northeast currency, same below) and the least earned more than 10 million. This autumn harvest, they calculated that the village had a surplus of sixty-two laborers, so they decided to send twenty people to contract to repair the forest railway, forty people to the mountains to repair the yards and shacks, preparing to go to the mountains to make wood in the winter, and two people to contract to repair the water ditches, all of whom were assigned party members to take the lead. The experience gained here is that in rural areas where land is scarce and the population is large with surplus labor, the branch should be good at combining agricultural and sideline production well in each season according to the actual situation in production leadership, so as to solve the use of surplus human and animal power and increase the income of farmers more, and reduce the waste of labor.

            According to the characteristics of scarce land and a large population, agricultural and sideline production are well integrated.

Third, the branch is good at organizing the broad masses to participate in production. It is understood that among the ninety-one full laborers and fifty-six half laborers in the village, except for one lonely old man named Wang, who is sixty-three years old and mainly raises cattle and dogs and did not participate in the production group, all the able-bodied men and women participated in organized labor in the main agricultural and sideline production. The reason for this is first of all because the branch, after relatively full democratic discussion inside and outside the party, ordering plans and production mobilization, attracted each mass to consciously and actively participate in production. Secondly, it is because the branch, when discussing the production plan, always started from the human and animal power of the whole village and the overall interests and actual situation, so that the production plan and the organization of labor were closely integrated. For example, in their sideline production in the winter of 1949, they planned to organize ninety-two people to go to the mountains to make wood, divided into: sawing group (eight large saws, sixteen people), road repair group (eight people), upper * raking group (fifteen rakes and plows, fifteen cattle, fifteen people), waist * raking group (same number as above), and two cooks and two clerks and four people feeding livestock for a total of sixty-two people all living in the mountains. In addition, a large motorcade (fifteen cars and thirty people, forty-five horses) was organized to be responsible for pulling wood from the mountain area to the station. They planned to make 24 meters a day, from the beginning of November to February next year for three months to make 2,200 meters (exceeding the task by 700 meters), earning 600,000 yuan per meter, a total of 1.32 billion yuan. The women, old men, and children at home were organized to weave mats, * and firewood and other sideline production. From this plan, it can be seen that the organization of the plan itself makes the masses understand that it is impossible to get a huge amount of production income without organizing. It is precisely because the branch can use timely and appropriate production organization so that the production plan can be completed or even exceeded, which has further established the prestige of the branch among the masses.

            Formulating plans or conveying instructions from higher authorities are fully discussed within the party, using organizational forces,
        Play the role of party members.

Fourth, the branch can promote democracy and be good at using organizational forces to play the role of party members in internal leadership. When formulating plans or conveying instructions from higher authorities, they can go through full discussion at the branch committee branch meeting, and can assign specific work to party members, so that each party member has their own regular tasks, and understands how to play a role. For example, in the sideline production in the winter of 1949, they decided to establish party groups according to sawing group, raking group, road repair group, and motorcade. Branch secretary Han En participated in the sawing group and was responsible for leading the groups on the mountain. They studied or held meetings in the shacks at night. Village chairman Song Liansheng led the motorcade, pulled wood up the mountain during the day, and went home to hold meetings at night, or went to the village government to work and check, instructing the work of the clerks. Party members and cadres (village cadres, branch cadres) not only participate in production but also play a leading role. For example, branch secretary Han En has a family of six (three children in school and a three-year-old child and his wife), five * of land, and does not cultivate for others, but cultivates all by himself. Village chairman Song Liansheng, with two people, cultivates seven mu of land by himself without cultivating for others. Cadre female party member Qiao Guizhi has three people and 1.7 mu of land. Her husband is the district chief in another district. There is also a five-year-old child in the family who also does not cultivate for others but cultivates by himself. The branch regularly calls on party members to not only do a good job in personal production, but also be responsible for doing a good job in the production group they participate in. All party members respond to the branch's call. For example, in the sideline production in the summer of 1949, it was decided that women would pick 2,000 catties of wild grapes. Female party member Zhang Guizhi, who was seven months pregnant, also took women to the mountains sixty miles away to pick wild grapes. This active role of party members has won the sincere support of the masses. The masses said, "There is nothing wrong with learning from party members." Not only that, but the party members themselves have also truly become rich through production. For example, among the nineteen party members, the original components were thirteen farm laborers, five poor peasants, and one middle peasant. Now the components are eight well-to-do middle peasants and eleven middle peasants. It can be concluded here that in many places, the view that party members believe that taking the lead is a loss, that party members have to miss work, and that village cadres cannot produce is one-sided. This can only prove that the leadership methods in these areas are not right.

The reason why the village's production can be done well is inseparable from the branch's ability to organize the masses for production according to local conditions and improve the organization of production. In 1947, because it was the initial establishment of the mutual aid group, the masses were not familiar with it, so the branch formed four mutual aid groups with four party members as the core. Later, it expanded to more than ten groups. At this time, there were five or six people in each group, and each group produced together. By the winter of that year and 1948, they felt that the village had a small amount of land and a large number of people with surplus labor, so they changed to the form of a large group leadership group. People were drawn from the large group to engage in sideline production, and the money earned was based on work points (that is, the so-called value according to labor). By 1949, they checked again and found that this method was not good, and it was not easy to be fair in eating, evaluating work, and distributing money, which affected the production enthusiasm of the masses. The branch studied this problem and discovered the past problems, so it changed to the organizational form of "dead group living arrangement." In form, this organization has a number of small groups (three to six) under each large group. Everyone participates in a fixed small group, and the regular labor unit is the small group, which is the so-called "dead group." The large group is responsible for uniformly adjusting labor and animal power according to production needs. This adjustment is divided into two aspects: one is in agriculture. When each small group is planting or weeding, according to how many people are needed to complete each piece of land in one day, that is, how many people go, and the remaining people are adjusted by the large group leader to the small group that lacks manpower, so as to avoid the problems of missing work due to moving several pieces of land in one day and changing several households for meals in one day, and unfair scoring. According to the degree of wasteland, the small group holds a field meeting every night, calculates which pieces of land to weed tomorrow and the allocation of manpower, and reports the number of manpower shortages to the large group leader. The other aspect is the adjustment between agriculture and sideline production, that is, the large group leader uniformly plans the number of labor, animal power, and agricultural needs of the subordinate small groups, and mobilizes surplus labor and animal power to engage in sideline production. Whoever is willing to engage in sideline production earns the money that belongs to them. Whoever cannot go manpower should take out vehicles and horses for others to use. It is also possible to earn money by engaging in sideline production. The points are determined according to the quality and strength of the vehicles and horses, and the money earned is divided according to the number of points determined by the person, horse, and vehicle. The land of the people who go out to engage in sideline production is contracted by the production team to plant and hoe, and he is responsible for paying the wages. The large group leader and the small group leader guarantee that the land of the people who go out to engage in sideline production will be cultivated and weeded in a timely manner, and can cultivate and weed well. The people who go out to engage in sideline production guarantee to take care of other people's vehicles and horses. This is the so-called "living arrangement."

    Timely improve the organization of production and implement the voluntary and equivalent policy.

In terms of organizational principles, the policies of voluntary combination and equivalent exchange are adopted. The composition of the small group is completely voluntary. The large group leader and the small group leader are democratically elected. The small group leader is naturally the head, but whoever is willing to be the head can also be when weeding the land for someone. In the exchange of labor, the points are rated according to the actual labor results every day. A field meeting is held every evening to publicly discuss the points that each person should get that day. A full laborer gets ten work points for working one day, and a half laborer or a large part of the laborer is rated according to his actual effect every day. Their accounting method is the work ticket system. The work tickets are divided into ten types from one point to ten points. In addition to writing the number of words on each work ticket, in order to avoid the illiteracy of the peasants, black dots are also printed according to the points. Whoever works for someone every day is carried by the person, and the work ticket stamped with his own hand. At the end of the field meeting, the number of work tickets that each person should get today is issued according to the results of the scoring. Livestock are rated according to their strength. The strongest are stipulated to be fifteen work points, and the weakest are ten work points. Work tickets are also issued after the work is completed every day. The livestock feed is prepared by the original owner. Whenever manure is sent and land is planted or weeded once, the account is settled once. Whenever the account is settled, each person first exchanges the tickets according to the hand stamp on the work ticket. Finally, whoever has surplus tickets in his hand proves that he has done more work, and he can go to whoever's stamp is on the ticket to ask for wages. This simple method can make their daily and seasonal work accounts very clear.

In addition, in the production agreement, they stipulate that anyone has the freedom to join or withdraw from the mutual aid group at any time. Whoever is unwilling to participate in the mutual aid group for a few days or a day or a few hours and is willing to do their own odd jobs can do so. This not only does not relax the mutual aid group, but on the contrary, it can attract every man and woman to participate in the mutual aid group at any time, which in fact consolidates and expands the mutual aid group.
        Improve the masses' understanding of policies and eliminate agricultural socialist ideas.

These historical changes in the branch's production organization, from independent and pure agricultural production teams, to large group leadership teams, and then to the current "dead group living arrangement," are all suitable for the situation and implement the party's policies. It can help the masses clarify their understanding of policies through organizing production, eliminate the idea of ​​"agricultural socialism," improve the enthusiasm of the masses for production, and attract the desire of the broad masses to organize. The experience gained here is that it is wrong to force the masses to organize, it is also wrong to advocate that the peasant masses engage in socialist collective production, and it is also wrong to let things go. In rural areas, we should, according to the actual situation, lead, on the basis of private property, and in accordance with the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, guide the masses to organize so as to more forcefully carry out the production movement combining agriculture and sideline production.

    领导生产的模范支部
    吉林蛟河县保安村中共支部介绍（上）
    吉林省蛟河县保安村支部，在土地改革后以全力领导群众生产，使群众由贫困变为丰衣足食的过程中成为全县的一等模范支部。该支部在领导群众生产上有这样几个主要特点：
            领导生产的特点
    第一、支部能够主动的根据环境可能与群众需要及劳力条件，及时的提出完全适合实际情况的生产计划。他们并不是照样传达上级的指示，或仅作党员个人生产计划，而是从实际情况和全村群众需要出发，周密恰当的制定出全体群众的生产计划。如一九四九年过旧历年时支部就讨论与制定了春耕的全部计划，春耕未结束就制定夏锄计划。夏季与挂锄期间的副业生产计划，在铲头遍地时支部就研讨出来。秋收与冬季副业生产，支部在九月中即作出了具体决定。他们都是在前一两个月就研讨下一季的生产计划，因此能够使每一个计划在党内党外作充分的讨论酝酿、修改，使之更切合实际与群众需要，同时也能够使党员与群众在每一个季节中都积极生产提前完成，以便于挤出时间，为下一个生产计划而奋斗，免除了群众生产中的盲目性与“不着忙”的拖拉思想。
   制定和讨论生产计划，吸引群众参加生产；生产计划与组织劳力紧相结合。
    第二、支部能根据本村地少人多的特点（每人平均三亩八分地，每个劳力合二垧二亩地），在领导生产中使农业生产与副业生产根据季节环境紧相结合，解决了多余劳动力的使用问题。如支部在讨论夏锄计划时，算计本村人力畜力均有剩余，即由党员带头领导一部分群众上山拉木头，铲头遍地时开始由党员迟佃文（村副主席）、张纪臣带领六个群众四台大车去拉，到铲二遍地时即增加到十三台大车二十六人，至九月十五日，每辆大车最多的赚三千五百多万（东北币，下同）最少的也赚一千多万元。今年秋收他们算计全村多余六十二个劳力，于是即决定二十人去包修森林铁路，四十人上山去修场子与窝棚，准备冬天上山作木头，二个人去包修水濠，其中都分配党员带头领导。这里得到的经验是地少人多劳力有余的农村，支部在生产领导上，应当善于在每个季节根据实际情况，把农业与副业生产很好结合起来，这样才能解决剩余人力畜力的使用和更多的增加农民的收入，减免劳力的浪费。
            根据地少人多特点，使农副业生产很好结合起来。
    第三、支部善于组织广大群众参加生产，据了解全村九十一个整劳力和五十六个半劳力中，除有一个性情孤僻以养牛狗为主业年纪六十三岁的王老头没有参加生产组外，所有能劳动的男女在主要的农业与副业的生产上都参加了有组织的劳动。所以如此，首先是由于支部经过党内外较充分的民主讨论，订计划与生产动员，吸引了每个群众自觉的积极的参加生产。其次就是由于支部在讨论生产计划时，都是从全村的人力畜力与整体的利益和实际情况出发，使生产计划与组织劳力紧相结合。例如他们一九四九年冬季的副业生产，计划组织九十二个人上山作木头，分为：截锯组（八道大锯十六人）、修道组（八人）、上?耙犁组（十五个耙犁、牛十五、人十五）、腰?耙犁组（数目同上），还有两个做饭的两个文书四个喂牲口的共六十二人全住在山上，另外组织一个大车队（十五台车三十人，马四十五匹），负责由山场到车站拉木头，他们计划一天作二十四米，十一月初上山到明年二月三个月能作二千二百米（超过任务七百米），每米六十万共赚十三亿二千万元。家里的妇女、老头、小孩则组织起来编席子、茓子及打柴等副业生产。从这个计划中就可看出他们计划本身的组织性使群众懂得不组织起来就不可能得到数额巨大的生产收入。正因为支部能运用因时适地的生产组织，使生产计划都能如数完成甚或超过，这便更加树立了支部在群众中的威信。
            制定计划或传达上级指示，均经党内充分讨论，运用组织力量，
        发挥党员作用。
    第四、支部在内部领导上，能够发扬民主善于运用组织力量，发挥党员的作用，他们在制定计划或传达上级指示时，都能经过支委支部大会的充分讨论，并能分配党员的具体工作，使每个党员都有自己的经常任务，和懂得怎样起作用。如一九四九年冬的副业生产中他们决定按截锯组、耙犁组、修道组、大车队成立党的小组，支书韩恩参加截锯组，并负责领导在山上的各组，白天生产晚上在窝棚里学习或开会。村主席宋连生领导大车队，白天上山拉木头，晚上回家开会，或到村政府去办公与检查，指示文书的工作。党员与干部（村干、支干）不仅都参加生产且都能起带头作用，如支书韩恩六口人（三个小孩上学还有一个三岁的小孩和老婆），五垧地，不代耕全自种。村主席宋连生两口人七亩地也是自种不代耕。干属妇女党员乔桂芝三个人一垧七亩地，她丈夫在外区当区长，家里还有五岁的小孩也是不代耕自己种。支部对党员经常提出号召，不但个人生产搞好，而且负责把自己参加的生产组搞好，所有的党员都响应支部号召，如一九四九年夏天的副业生产中决定妇女采二千斤野葡萄，女党员张桂芝已怀孕七个多月还带着妇女到六十里外的大山里，去采野葡萄。党员的这种积极作用，获得群众的真诚拥护，群众说：“跟党员学，没有错。”不仅如此，而且党员本身也都真正的生产致富了，如十九个党员中原来成份雇农十三人，贫农五人，中农一人，现在成份是富裕中农八人，中农十一人。在这里可以得出经验证明，有许多地方支部党员认为带头就是吃亏，党员就得误工，村干部不能生产的看法是片面的，这仅能证明这些地区在领导方法上不对头。
    该村生产所以能搞得好，与支部能够因地适时的组织群众生产，和改善生产组织形式，是分不开的。在一九四七年时，因为是初成立变工组，群众都不摸底，支部便以四个党员为核心组成四个变工组，后来扩展到十多个组，这时是五六个人一组，各组在一块生产。到是年冬和一九四八年他们感到该村地少人多劳力有余，于是便改成大组领导小组的形式，由大组抽出人去搞副业，赚的钱按工分钱（即所谓按劳取值），到一九四九年他们又检查到这种办法不好，在吃饭、评工、分钱上不易办的公平，影响了群众的生产积极性，支部研究了这个问题，发现了过去的毛病，故又改成“死组活编”的组织形式。这种组织在形式上是每个大组下有若干小组（三个至六个不等），每个人都参加固定的小组，经常的劳动单位是小组，这即所谓“死组”。大组负责按生产需要统一调剂劳力、畜力，这种调剂分两方面：一是在农业上的，每小组在种地或铲地时，按照每块地需要多少人一天干完，即去多少人，剩下的人由大组长调剂到人力不足的小组去，这样可以免去因一天挪好几块地而误工和一天换几户而管饭，与评分不公的毛病。根据地荒的程度由小组每晚开地头会，合计明天铲那几块地和人力的分配，并向大组长报告本组人力的缺余数目。另一方面则是农业与副业上的调剂，即大组长统一计划所属小组的劳力畜力与农业需要的数目，动员多余人力畜力去搞副业生产，谁愿去搞副业赚的钱归他自己所有，谁不能去人力，拿出车马来由别人使用，搞副业也可。按车马好坏强弱定分，赚的钱按人马车所定的份数分钱，出去搞副业的人的土地由生产小组包种包铲，他负责支工钱，大组长与小组长保证把出去搞副业的人的土地，适时耕种，铲趟、并能耕铲得好，出去搞副业的人保证爱护别人的车马，这即是所谓“活编”。
    适时改善生产组织形式，贯彻自愿等价政策。
    在组织原则上是采取了自愿结合与等价交换的政策，小组的组成完全是自愿结合的，大组长与小组长都是民主选举的，小组长为当然打头的，但是给谁铲地时，谁愿自己打头也可以。人工交换上是采取每天按实际劳动结果评分，每天的傍晚开地头会，公议每人当天所应得的分数，整劳力干一天是十分工，半劳力或大半劳力是按他每天的实际效果评分。他们记账的办法是用工票制，工票分为一分的到十分的十种，每张工票上除写着字数外，为了怕农民的不识字，还按分数印上黑点。每天给谁干活即由谁带着，盖上自己手戳的工票，在开完地头会时，按照评分的结果，发给每人本日应得的工票分数。牲口是按强弱评分，最强的规定十五分工，最弱的十分工，也是每天干完活发工票，牲口草料归原主自备，每当送完粪与种完地或铲完一遍地即结帐一次，每当结帐的时候，每个人是先按工票上的手戳去交换票，最后谁的手里还有余票就证明他多干了活，他就可以依照票上的手戳是谁，就去向谁要工钱，这种简易办法能使他们每天每季的工账都搞得很清楚。
    另外在生产公约上，他们规定任何人都有随时加入或退出变工组的自由，在某几天或一天或几小时谁不愿参加变工组而愿作自己的零活都可以，这样不但没有松弛了变工组，相反的便能随时吸引每一个男人女人参加变工组，事实上更巩固与扩大了变工组。
        提高群众对政策的认识，肃清农业社会主义思想。
    支部在生产组织上的这些历史的改变，由独立的单纯农业生产小组，改成大组领导小组，进而改成现在的“死组活编”，都是适合情况与贯彻了党的政策的，它能够通过组织生产，帮助群众明确对政策的认识，肃清了“农业社会主义”的思想，提高了群众生产热情，吸引了广大群众组织起来的心愿。这里得到的经验是强迫群众组织起来是不对的，主张农民群众搞社会主义性的集体生产也是不对的，放任自流也是不对的。在农村中我们应按照实际情况，有领导的，在私有财产的基础上，根据自愿两利原则，引导群众组织起来，以便更有力的开展农业与副业相结合的生产运动。（未完）
