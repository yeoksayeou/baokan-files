    Lenin's Mausoleum
    Zhou Ping
    For twenty-six years since Lenin's death, representatives of all nationalities in the Soviet Union and people from all countries in the world, millions of men and women, have visited his mausoleum. Lenin's Mausoleum is located on Red Square in Moscow, near the walls of the Kremlin. It is built of red and black stone, appearing dignified and great. For the Soviet people, Lenin's Mausoleum is not only the greatest mausoleum, but also a sacred place where people gather during major events and national holidays, and a podium from which Stalin and the Bolshevik Party, along with the leaders of the Soviet government, speak to the people.
    During the difficult days of the war, on November 7, 1941, when the Hitlerite bandits were standing outside Moscow, Stalin bid farewell to the Soviet soldiers heading to the front lines, delivering a speech from the podium of the mausoleum: "May you be inspired by the victorious banner of the great Lenin!" After defeating Hitler's Germany, Soviet soldiers brought the flags of the annihilated enemy troops to Red Square and threw them at the foot of the mausoleum. Every national holiday, the anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, May Day, and the international holiday of the working people, the Soviet people invariably gather on Red Square. As the marching columns pass Lenin's Mausoleum, they are saluted by Stalin and Soviet government officials from the podium of the mausoleum.
    On the days when the mausoleum is open, long lines of people form a huge stream on Red Square. They slowly walk down the granite steps and enter the inner chamber of the mausoleum. Here, the surface of the walls is made of black and gray stone, inlaid with red stone. Lenin lies here—his body dressed in the simple green suit he wore during his lifetime, placed in a crystal sarcophagus. The sarcophagus is so transparent that it is as if nothing separates Lenin from the endless stream of people walking past the coffin. A soft light shines on Lenin's face. A half-mast flag hangs on the flagpole next to the sarcophagus. Men, women, old and young, take off their hats and quietly walk past Lenin, gazing at his face, wanting to take with them the memory of this greatest figure of our era.

    列宁墓
    周萍
    自列宁逝世二十六年以来，苏联一切民族和世界一切国家人民的代表、千百万男人和女人拜谒过他的陵墓。列宁墓在莫斯科红场上，靠近克里姆林宫的围墙。它是用红色和黑色的石头建筑的，显得尊严而伟大。对苏联人民来说，列宁墓不仅是最伟大的陵寝，而且是一个圣地，遇有重大事件和国家节日，人民就在这里集会，又是一个讲台，斯大林和布尔塞维克党与苏联政府的领袖们就从这上面对人民讲话。
    在战争的艰苦日子里，一九四一年十一月七日，当希特勒匪帮站在莫斯科的门外时，斯大林向开赴前线的苏联战士送别，从陵墓的讲台上致词说：“但愿你们为伟大列宁的胜利旗帜所鼓舞！”在战胜希特勒德国以后，苏联战士把被歼敌军的旗子带到了红场，投在陵墓的脚下。每逢国家的节日、十月社会主义革命节、五一劳动节、以及劳动人民的国际节日，苏联人民无例外地要在红场上集会。行进的纵队走过列宁墓时，受到斯大林和苏联政府的官员从陵墓的讲台上对他们敬礼。
    当陵墓开放的日子，人们的长长的行列就在红场上形成一股巨流。他们慢慢地走下花岗石的台级，进入陵墓的内寝。这里墙壁的表面是用黑石和灰石砌的，并镶嵌着红石。列宁就卧在这里——遗体上穿着他生时穿的那种简单的绿色外衣，装在水晶的石棺里。石棺是这样的透明，就好象没有任何东西隔开列宁和无尽的水流似的在棺旁走过的人群。柔和的光线照在列宁的面上。石棺旁边的旗杆上挂着半旗。男女老幼都脱下帽来，静静地在列宁身旁走过，注视着他的面貌，想要带去我们这时代这位最伟大的人物的记忆。
