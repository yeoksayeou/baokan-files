Short Commentary:

    Clearly understanding the disaster situation, formulating practical disaster relief measures based on local conditions, and strengthening leadership and inspection during the production and disaster relief movement, promptly identifying problems and correcting deviations. This is the basic and successful experience that has been repeatedly proven in past disaster relief work in the liberated areas. The Tianjin Prefecture's inspection of winter production and disaster relief (see yesterday's newspaper) and the inspection in Pingyuan Province once again prove the correctness of the above experience.

    In order to implement the Government Administration Council's instructions on production and disaster relief and lead the masses in disaster areas to overcome natural disasters, Party committees, governments, mass organizations, and people from all walks of life are engaged in arduous efforts in various places. Various regions have formulated production and disaster relief plans and are guiding the masses to engage in production for self-salvation in many ways. Some areas have not only solved the current lives of disaster victims but are also striving for certain savings to tide them over the spring famine and are preparing to shift the production for surviving the famine to the large-scale production movement this spring. In these areas, the Party and the government have completely mastered the initiative in disaster relief work, and the masses have high confidence in production for self-salvation. However, in some other places, the opposite situation exists. As pointed out in the supplementary instructions of the Ministry of Interior on production and disaster relief on the 6th of this month: "They do not understand the disaster situation, are unprepared for the spring famine, and have no solution when hunger comes." What is the reason for this? In a word, it is their lack of leadership and inspection of disaster relief work. They only generally know that the disaster situation is serious, or they have also made some calls for disaster relief and work arrangements, but to what extent is the disaster situation serious? Are the disaster relief plans feasible? And how is it going? They are ignorant or have a superficial understanding. The leading organs in such areas are generally initially paralyzed by the disaster situation, blindly optimistic, thinking that the disaster situation is not serious; or thinking that the masses will always have a way to solve it themselves and do not need to be concerned; or thinking that they have already roughly "arranged" the "disaster relief work" and everything will be fine. However, once a serious phenomenon occurs, they panic and are at a loss, often causing significant losses that should not have occurred.

    In order to correctly implement the Government Administration Council's instructions on production and disaster relief, we suggest that all regions promptly carry out inspection work on production and disaster relief. This inspection can be carried out through certain meetings, as done in Tianjin Prefecture; more importantly, certain responsible cadres must personally go to the disaster areas to conduct actual investigations, grasp the situation, identify problems, and solve some urgent problems of the masses in the disaster areas as much as possible, and provide in-depth guidance on disaster relief work.

    Correctly organizing the inspection of disaster relief work can enhance the staff's concern and sense of responsibility for the people's lives, consolidate the close connection between the Party, the government, and the people, and at the same time, improve the staff's working methods and work style. In the inspection work, various good experiences in disaster relief work should be disseminated in a timely manner, exemplary achievements in the work should be commended, various erroneous ideas and practices should be criticized, and some staff members who have made mistakes should be helped to improve their work.

    Production and disaster relief is a major event nationwide at present. Party and government organs at all levels should overcome all difficulties and implement the Government Administration Council's instructions on disaster relief without discount. For this purpose, the leading organs in areas with disasters must carefully inspect disaster relief work. Only in this way can they have a clear mind, truly achieve "knowing the situation well," and accurately complete this great and arduous task.

    检查生产救灾工作
    清楚地掌握灾情，按照各地不同的情况，订出切实可行的救灾办法，并在生产救灾运动过程中加强领导和检查，及时发现问题，纠正偏向。这是过去解放区各地救灾工作中已经被反复证明是成功的基本的经验。天津专区这次对于冬季生产救灾的检查（见昨日本报）及平原省的检查，又一次证明上述经验的正确性。
    对于执行政务院生产救灾指示，领导灾区群众战胜灾荒，各地党、政府、群众团体和社会人士正在从事艰巨的努力。各地均制定了生产救灾的计划，并引导群众多方面地从事生产自救。有些地区不但解决了灾民目前的生活，还努力争取一定的积蓄，以便渡过春荒，并准备将生产渡荒有计划地转向今春的大生产运动。在这种地区党和政府对于救灾工作，完全掌握了主动，群众生产自救的信心很高。但另外也有个别地方则存在着相反的情况，他们正如本月六日内务部关于生产救灾补充指示中所指出的：“对灾情不了解，对春荒无准备，饥饿来临，毫无办法”。这是什么原因呢？一句话，就是他们对于救灾工作缺乏领导和检查。他们只笼统地知道灾情重，或者也作了些救灾的号召和工作布置，但是灾情重到什么程度？救灾方案是否可行？以及行得如何？却是茫然无知，或一知半解。这样地区的领导机关，一般是最初对灾情表现麻痹，盲目乐观，以为灾情不重；或以为群众自己总会有办法，可以不必去管；或者以为已经大致“布置”了一下“救灾工作”，即可以万事大吉。但是，一旦严重现象发生，他们就手忙脚乱，不知所措，往往造成不应有的重大损失。
    为了正确贯彻政务院生产救灾指示，我们建议各地及时开展生产救灾的检查工作，这种检查可以通过一定的会议来进行，如像天津专区所做的那样；更重要的，则是还须有一定负责的干部亲自到灾区去实际考查，掌握情况，发现问题，并尽可能及时解决灾区群众中一些急迫的问题，深入指导救灾工作。
    正确地组织对救灾工作的检查，可以提高工作人员对人民生活的关切和责任观念，巩固党、政府和人民的亲密连系，同时，也可以改进工作人员的工作方法和工作作风。检查工作中应及时传播救灾工作中各种好的经验，表扬工作中的模范成绩，批评各种错误思想和作法，并帮助一些犯了错误的工作人员改进工作。
    生产救灾是目前全国范围内的一件大事。各地党政机关应克服一切困难，不折不扣地贯彻政务院的救灾指示。为了这个目的，有灾情地区的领导机关一定要很好地检查救灾工作。只有这样才能清醒头脑，真正作到“心中有数”，准确地完成这一伟大而艰巨的任务。
