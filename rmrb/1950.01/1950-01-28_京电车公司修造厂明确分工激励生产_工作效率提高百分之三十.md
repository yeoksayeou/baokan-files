    Beijing News: The Beijing Tram Company Repair Factory has clarified the division of labor, allocated group tasks and individual tasks, and implemented a voucher-based piecework system, resulting in a 30 to 50 percent increase in work efficiency. In the year since liberation, although the Repair Factory has completed two "Hundred Vehicle Campaigns," the following shortcomings still existed: First, the production plans set each time were not very specific, and the estimates of manpower and materials were not accurate, so sometimes the progress of work was affected due to incomplete materials or other sudden tasks. Second, the division of labor was not clear, and sometimes it was unclear who was responsible for a task. Third, there was a lack of inspection and statistical systems, so it was difficult to evaluate achievements after tasks were completed. Fourth, the reward system was not sound. In general, there was more spiritual praise and less material reward. Due to the above reasons, the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers could not be fully utilized. In response to these shortcomings, the factory's administration, in this year's overall production plan, has set out specific plans in two-month periods, determining the number of newly built, overhauled, and medium-repaired vehicles, as well as the number of frequently repaired parts. When these plans were being drawn up, the factory's Communist Party branch and Communist Youth League branch first conducted internal discussions among Party and League members. Then the administration convened a meeting of foremen to pass the plans, and the trade union also sought opinions through group leaders. At that time, some individual foremen did not understand the significance of the division of labor in the production plan, and had some concerns, thinking that if the work was divided among everyone, the foremen would have nothing to do. The factory management committee, understanding this situation, before the division of labor in each department, first had the factory director review last year's work, and then clearly explain the specific methods of division of labor: dividing the entire Repair Factory's tasks into several parts, and then having each group use democratic methods to divide the group's work into individual tasks and collective tasks; in the future, bonuses would be given for exceeding the tasks. From January, a personal voucher piecework system was also implemented as the basis for cost accounting and rewards, and a finished product acceptance inspection system was implemented. The implementation of these systems, due to following the mass line and the proper coordination of the Party, government, trade union, and League, has greatly boosted the morale of the workers. Everyone said that this time it is clear, and we will see who exceeds the task. After the division of labor was clarified, production efficiency immediately improved. In the past, the copperhead group could only produce 330 copperhead pieces in eight hours of work per day, but after the division of labor, they produced 825 pieces in five hours; machinists used to turn 50 copper screws per person per day, but after the division of labor, this increased to 100.

### 京电车公司修造厂明确分工激励生产  工作效率提高百分之三十

    京电车公司修造厂明确分工激励生产
    工作效率提高百分之三十
    【北京讯】电车公司修造厂明确分工，划分了小组任务、个人任务、并实行传票记工制，工作效率提高百分之三十至五十。解放后一年来，修造厂虽然曾经完成了两次百辆车运动，但是仍存在着下列几个缺点：第一、每次订的生产计划不很具体，对人力物力估计的不精确，所以有时因材料不齐或其他突击任务，影响了工作的进度。第二、分工不明确，有时有工作不知该谁管。第三、缺乏检查和统计制度，所以任务完成后，不好评功。第四、奖励制度不健全。一般的只是精神表扬多，物质奖励少。由于以上几种原因，工人的积极性和创造性，不能充分发挥出来。针对这些缺点，该厂行政方面在今年全年的生产计划中，又以两月为一期分别订出具体计划，确定了新造、大修、和中修车辆的数目，以及经常修理零件的数目。订这些计划时，该厂中共支部和青年团支部，先在党团员中进行酝酿。然后行政上召集领班开会通过，工会也通过小组长征求意见。当时有个别的领班，对生产计划分工的意义不了解，有些顾虑，以为活儿分给大伙儿，领班就没事了。工厂管理委员会了解到这种情况，就在各部门分工之前，先由厂长检讨去年的工作，然后清楚地说明分工的具体办法：把整个修造厂的任务分成若干份，再由各组用民主方式把本组的工作分成个人任务和集体任务；将来凡超过任务的就给奖。从一月起，还实行个人传票记工制，作为成本核算和奖励的基础，并实行成品验收检查制度。推行这些制度，由于走了群众路线，党、政、工、团配合的得当，工人情绪很高。都说这回可明确了，咱们看谁超过任务。任务分工明确后，生产效率随即提高，案工过去全班每天工作八小时只做铜头片三百三十片，分工后，五小时就做了八百二十五片；机工镟铜螺丝，以前每人每天镟五十条，分工后增到了一百条。
