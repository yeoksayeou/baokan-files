It was unanimously agreed that as long as relevant units such as administrative departments, financial departments, and science and technology departments strengthen organization and contact, vigorously lead and assist the emancipated suburban farmers in production, it will be possible to increase agricultural production in the suburbs of Beijing this year by 10% compared to normal years. The meeting discussed the following methods of increasing production in detail: dredging rivers and canals to prevent flooding; digging wells and opening canals to expand paddy fields and prevent drought; using various methods to increase fertilization, accumulate fertilizer, and promote improved varieties of crops; planting trees and afforestation; protecting and appropriately adding livestock to solve the difficulties of some farmers lacking seeds and farm tools.
