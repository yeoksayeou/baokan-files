    Grain Corporation Entrusts Large Amounts of Processing
    Beijing's Grain Processing Industry Increases
    Only One, Fuxing and Other Factories Add Warehouses and Plan to Increase Machines
    [This Newspaper] Beijing Grain Corporation has vigorously supported the city's grain processing industry over the past year by entrusting food grain processing, enabling the industry to recover and develop. Before the liberation of Beijing, there were only seventeen mechanized flour mills in the city, with seventy-six machines and over six hundred workers. Due to the influx of American flour and the Kuomintang reactionaries' destruction and exploitation of national industry and commerce, the industry's business was sluggish and production was low. Of the seventeen, fifteen barely managed to survive, and two (Xintai and Tongfeng) were shut down. At the beginning of Beijing's liberation, although there were more than 700 semi-mechanized flour mills and grinding mills, most of them were shut down.
    After the liberation of Beijing, with the development of the Grain Corporation's business, the processing industry also increased accordingly. In April, the number of processors on behalf of the company reached a maximum of 438. Due to the lack of strict selection of private merchants for processing at that time, lack of experience in supervision and inspection, failure to grasp the essentials, and inaccurate cost calculations, malpractices such as defrauding and stealing, substituting fine quality with inferior goods, poor quality, and failure to comply with contracts occurred. Subsequently, experience was gradually gained, an inspection and testing system was established, cost accounting was initially implemented, and in accordance with the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, reasonable profits were given to processing flour mills and grinding mills. Those who failed to fulfill the processing contracts were persuaded and educated, or punished, and those who processed well were rewarded and commended, so that the grain processing work gradually got on the right track, the quality of processed products was guaranteed, and the delivery rate gradually increased. In the business contacts with the Grain Corporation, the processing households gradually realized that only by honestly processing for state-owned trading institutions could they achieve their own recovery and development, so the processing gradually became serious, and they automatically studied and improved technology, so that the business entered a normal development. Flour mills and machines have increased significantly. The number of mechanized flour mills increased from seventeen to twenty-six, and the number of machines increased from seventy-six to one hundred and eighteen. The working hours of each factory generally increased from seven or eight hours to twenty-four hours, and the monthly output increased by about two times. The processing plants also partially added equipment and expanded reproduction. In addition to adding warehouses, Only One, Fuxing and other factories are planning to increase machines.
    The number of coarse grain processors has also increased from 737 to 838 in the past year. The number of vertical rice mills in each household was originally about 30, but currently there are 106 who are only engaged in processing for the company. Last March, the total amount of finished products processed by various coarse and fine grain processing factories for the Grain Corporation was 1,825,479 jin, and in December it reached 19,896,931 jin, an increase of more than ten times. The flour processed by various factories for the Grain Corporation accounted for only a little over 17% of the total flour production in March, and increased to a little over 70% in December.

### 粮食公司大量委托加工  京粮食加工业增加  惟一、福兴等厂添盖仓房筹增机器

    粮食公司大量委托加工
    京粮食加工业增加
    惟一、福兴等厂添盖仓房筹增机器
    【本报讯】北京粮食公司一年来通过委托食粮加工，对京市食粮加工业予以大力扶植，使该业得到恢复与发展。北京在解放之前，仅有机器面粉业十七家，机器七十六部，工人六百余人。由于美国面粉充斥市面，加上国民党反动派对民族工商业的摧残盘剥，更使该业生意萧条，生产低落。十七家中，有十五家勉强维持，两家（新泰、同丰）陷于停顿。北京解放之初，半机制面粉业和磨坊业虽有七百多家，但大部陷于停顿。
    北京解放后，随着粮食公司业务的开展，加工业也随之增多。四月间，代该公司加工者，最多曾达四三八家。由于当时对加工私商选择不很严格，监督检查缺乏经验，不得要领，成本计算也不精确，因而发生骗取盗卖，提精顶次，品质低劣，不守合同等流弊。随后逐渐取得经验，建立检查、化验制度，初步试行成本计算，并本着公私兼顾的原则，给加工粉厂磨坊以合理利润，对不履行加工合同者进行说服教育，或加以惩罚，加工好者予以奖励表扬，乃使粮食加工工作渐渐走上正轨，加工品的品质有了保证，交品率也日渐提高。各加工户在与粮食公司业务联系中，也逐渐认识到只有诚实地给国营贸易机构加工，才能得到自己的恢复与发展，因而加工渐趋认真，自动研究改进技术，使业务步入正常发展。粉厂和机器均有显著增加。机器制粉厂由十七家增到二十六家，机器由七十六部增到一百一十八部。各厂工作时间一般均由七、八小时增至二十四小时，月产量约增二倍。加工厂并部分添置设备，扩大再生产。惟一、福兴等厂除添盖仓房外，并正筹增机器。
    粗粮加工户，一年中也由七三七家增到八三八家。各户之立式碾米机原约三十部，目前只为该公司担任加工者已有一百零六部。去年三月，各粗细粮加工工厂为粮食公司加工的成品总量为一、八二五、四七九斤，十二月份则达一九、八九六、九三一斤，约增加十倍多。各工厂为粮食公司加工的面粉，三月间仅占全部面粉产量百分之十七强，十二月份已增至百分之七十强。
