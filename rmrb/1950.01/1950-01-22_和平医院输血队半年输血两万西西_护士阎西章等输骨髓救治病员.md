    Peace Hospital Blood Transfusion Team Transfuses 20,000 cc of Blood in Half a Year; Nurse Yan Xizhang and Others Transfuse Bone Marrow to Save Patients
    [This Newspaper's Report] Since the establishment of the blood transfusion team by the staff of the Peace Hospital of the Health Department of the North China Military Region in July last year, the comrades of the blood transfusion team have demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary spirit of fraternal love, transfusing a total of 23,520 cc of blood, enabling many patients to escape danger and recover quickly. Nurses Yan Xizhang, Guo Mingshan, Zhao Furong, Zhang Xiuhua, Lu Yuping, and other comrades endured the pain of having their own bone marrow punctured and transfused to patients, saving seriously injured comrades. The hospital's blood transfusion team is divided into four sub-teams: hospital department, internal medicine, surgery, and ENT, with each sub-team divided into four groups according to blood type. This allows doctors to quickly find the required blood type, overcoming the difficulties of finding people temporarily in the past, and enabling blood transfusions to be carried out quickly and in a timely manner. At present, the team still has some shortcomings that need to be overcome: such as the organization not being strict enough, and failure to adjust in a timely manner after personnel transfers, sometimes making it impossible to find people for blood transfusions; and failure to strictly check blood transfusion team members for hidden diseases (malaria, syphilis, kala-azar, etc.) before blood transfusions, resulting in some patients contracting malaria after blood transfusions.

    和平医院输血队半年输血两万西西
    护士阎西章等输骨髓救治病员
    【本报讯】华北军区卫生部和平医院自去年七月由该院工作人员组成输血队以来，输血队同志发扬了高度革命的友爱精神，共输血二万三千五百二十西西，使许多病员能脱离危险和很快恢复健康。护士阎西章、郭明山、赵福荣、张秀华、卢玉萍等同志忍痛将自己的骨髓穿刺出来输给了病人，挽救了重伤同志。该院输血队分院部、内科、外科、五官科四个分队，每分队按血型分为四组，这样医生可随时找到需要的血型，克服过去临时找人的困难，使输血能迅速及时进行。目前该队还有些缺点尚须克服：如组织尚不严密，人员调动后未及时调整，使有时找不到输血的人；输血队员输血前未严格检查有无暗疾（疟病、梅毒、黑热病等），因此使有的病人在输血后传染了疟疾。
