    New People Celebrate the New Year
    A Record of the Women's Production and Education Center During the New Year
    Xu Guan

    In the days leading up to the New Year, the students (liberated prostitutes) of the Education Center mobilized and busied themselves rehearsing entertainment programs. Hanjiatan and Baishun Hutong were filled with joyous sounds of gongs, drums, and singing, transforming this place, which had long been a den of iniquity for women, into another free and joyful world.

    On New Year's Eve, each of their units held a thorough cleaning. After more than a month of ideological education, they are beginning to establish a labor perspective, moving furniture, cleaning roofs, scrubbing floors... with their own hands, tidying up the rooms so that they looked brand new, a big improvement from when they first arrived and found even lifting a bed difficult.

    They saved the money they would have used for food and pooled it to buy red paper for writing couplets and to buy portraits of Chairman Mao to hang up. Somehow, the news got around that their rooms were not lecture halls and could not display portraits of Chairman Mao. This made them very disappointed. One student was so anxious she was about to cry, saying, "Why can't we hang them? He is our great savior. We are liberated today. Even if we can't see him in person, we must pay our respects to his portrait for the New Year and vow to become new people, study hard, and participate in labor." When they later learned that they could hang the portraits, they were so happy they almost jumped for joy, carefully hanging the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall, afraid of putting it up crookedly. They also cut and pasted paper cuttings on the windows, and pasted slogans such as "Celebrate the Liberation of All of China!", "Long Live the Communist Party!", and "Happy New Year!" on the walls.

    On New Year's Day, they all got up before dawn, combed their hair, washed their faces, and changed into clean clothes. Representatives from each unit held a New Year's gathering, encouraging each other to make progress. On the 2nd, each unit organized entertainment. Compared with past years, not only has the form of life changed, but the content of life has been completely turned upside down. They said, "This is truly like a frozen river thawing after a thousand years, and an iron tree blooming after ten thousand years. We have never celebrated the New Year so happily. In the past, whenever the New Year (Lunar New Year) arrived, how many of us didn't cry? The customers all went home to reunite with their wives and children, but we were lonely and had to watch the boss's face. Don't even mention eating dumplings; if you were lucky, you might not even get a full meal, let alone avoid being beaten and scolded. But this year, this liberated year, the sisters are gathered together, eating well for three meals in a row, and we're even having an entertainment show. This is truly something we never dreamed of!"

    Indeed, this year they are new people celebrating the New Year. Although transformation is only just beginning, this group of sisters who have escaped the fiery pit has embarked on the path of light.

    新人过新年
    记新年中的妇女生产教养院
    徐观
    在新年的前几天，教养院的学员（解放了的妓女）们就动员起来，忙着排演游艺节目。韩家潭与百顺胡同洋溢着一片欢乐的锣鼓声和歌唱声，这个曾经成为多年来妇女魔窟的地方一变而为另一个自由欢乐的世界了。
    除夕的白天，她们每个所里都举行了大扫除。经过了一个多月的思想教育，她们正在开始建立劳动观点，自己动手抬家具、上房顶打扫、擦地板……，把屋子整理得焕然一新，比起刚来时，抬床铺还嫌费劲的情形就进步多了。
    她们把买吃食的钱节省下来，凑在一块买红纸写对联，买毛主席像悬挂。不知怎么有个消息，说她们屋子不是讲堂、不能挂毛主席的像。这使她们很扫兴，有一个学员急的要哭了，说：“为什么我们不能挂呢？他是我们的大救星，我们今天解放了，我们见不着他，一定要对着他的像拜年，发誓做新人，努力学习，参加劳动。”当后来知道可以悬挂时，她们都快活得跳起来了，小心翼翼地把毛主席像悬挂在墙壁上，惟恐贴得歪了。在玻璃窗上，她们还剪贴了窗花，墙上则贴了“庆祝全中国解放！”“共产党万岁！”和“新年快乐！”等口号。
    元旦这天，她们没天亮就都起来了，梳头洗脸，换了干净的衣服。各所学员派代表举行团拜，互相勉励进步，二号各所又组织了游艺，这和往年来比，不仅生活的形式改变了，生活的内容是完全翻了一个过儿，她们说：“这真是千年的冰河解了冻，万年的铁树开了花，我们从来没有这样快乐的过过年，从前每到了年上（旧历年），有几个不哭的？嫖客们都回家同妻子儿女团圆去了，可是我们孤零零的看老板领家的脸子，别说吃顿饺子了，弄不好，连一顿饱饭也摊不上，不挨打受骂，那就算运气了。可是今年，这个解放的年，姐妹们聚在一块，一连三顿都是吃好的，还要开游艺会，这真是做梦也没想到啊！”
    真的，她们今年是新人过新年了。虽然改造还只是开始，但是这一群跳出火坑的姐妹们，已走上了光明的大道。
