Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 6th: TASS reports: Egypt held elections for members of the parliamentary House of Representatives on January 3rd. The elections have not yet concluded. In electoral districts where candidates did not receive an absolute majority of votes, a second election will be held on January 10th.

The House of Representatives has a total of 319 members. However, in this election, 981 candidates are competing for only 298 seats. According to Egyptian election law, 21 members are considered already elected because no other candidates were nominated in their districts. In most districts, three candidates are competing, and in some districts, as many as six. Although Egypt has a population of 19 million, the number of voters does not exceed 5 million because women do not have the right to vote.

According to preliminary election results (all ballots have not yet been counted), the influential bourgeois nationalist Wafd Party won the most seats—96. It has been the opposition party since it refused to participate in the 1945 elections. Since then, the Wafd Party has had no representatives in the House of Representatives or the government. The Saadist Party, which has been in power for the past five years and is pro-British, won eight seats. The bourgeois Liberal Constitutionalist Party, which participates in the coalition government, has so far won only seven seats. The semi-fascist party headed by Hafez Ramadan, which calls itself the "National Party" (and participates in the coalition government along with the Saadist Party and the Liberal Constitutionalist Party), has so far won only six seats. Independent candidates have won a total of ten seats. The Communist Party is banned in Egypt and did not participate in the elections.

Newspapers report that during the elections, troops were concentrated in major industrial centers to assist the police. During the election campaign, more than 500 progressives were arrested under the still unrepealed 1948 martial law. Under the pretext of "searching for weapons," the authorities conducted comprehensive searches, and ten people were killed. On election day, conflicts occurred in several places, and another ten people were killed.

    埃及众院议员选举中
    五百进步人士被捕
    【新华社北京六日电】塔斯社开罗讯：埃及在一月三日举行议会众议院议员的选举。选举还没有结束，在那些候选人没有得到绝大多数选票的选区，将在一月十日举行第二次选举。
    众议院共有三百十九个议员。然而，在这次选举中，九百八十一个候选人却只竞选二百九十八个席位，根据埃及选举法规定，有二十一名议员被算作已经选出，因为在他们的选区里没有提出其他候选人来。在大部分选区，有三个候选人竞选，有些选区多至六人。虽然埃及有一千九百万人口，但选民的数目却不超过五百万，因为妇女没有选举权。
    根据初步选举结果（全部选票还没有计算完竣），有势力的资产阶级民族主义的华夫脱党获得了最多的议席——九十六席，自从该党拒绝参加一九四五年的选举以来，它就是反对党。从那时开始，华夫脱党既没有代表参加众议院，也没有代表参加政府。在过去五年中执政并亲英的萨德主义党得到八席。参加联合政府的资产阶级立宪自由党，迄今只得七席。以哈费兹·拉马丹为首自称为“民族党”的半法西斯党（它和萨德主义党及立宪自由党一同参加联合政府）迄今只得六席。无党派的候选人共得十席。共产党在埃及是被禁止的，他们没有参加选举。
    据报纸报道：在选举时，部队曾集中在大工业中心，以帮助警察。在选举运动中，有五百多个进步人士由于仍未取消的一九四八年的戒严令而被捕。在“搜查武器”的托辞下，当局曾进行了全面的搜查，有十人遇害。在选举日，有若干地方曾发生冲突，另有十人遇害。
