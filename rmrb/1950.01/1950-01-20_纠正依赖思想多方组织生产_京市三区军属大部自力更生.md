    Correcting Dependence Mentality, Organizing Production in Multiple Ways
    Most Military Dependents in Beijing's Third District Rely on Self-Reliance
    [Report from this newspaper] Beijing's Third District actively organizes production for the families of martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, military personnel, and cadres, combined with political education, resulting in achievements in preferential treatment work. The district has 1,545 households and 6,730 people who are families of martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, military personnel, and cadres. At the beginning of Beijing's liberation, due to insufficient political awareness among the families of those newly enlisted in the army, most overemphasized preferential treatment, and some military dependents developed a sense of dependence and parasitism.
    Based on this situation, the district's Preferential Treatment Section humbly listened to their opinions, understood their difficulties, and decided to organize them for production and learning. First, they mobilized 251 military dependents to participate in military dependents' study classes, adult night schools, sewing factory training classes, and cooperative study classes. Representatives and group leaders were selected from the military dependents in all 18 street areas in the district, and they were frequently engaged in individual conversations and large meetings for education, praising those with high awareness, gradually improving their political awareness, and promoting their enthusiasm for production labor. As a result, the demand for preferential treatment gradually decreased from 55% in March to 18% in December.
    In terms of production, the district first conducted in-depth investigations into the production conditions of military dependents and market conditions, discovering and cultivating production backbones, and developing production through them. Specific assistance and guidance were provided in terms of production funds and production organization, so that production gradually consolidated and moved towards regularization. At present, the district has organized one sewing factory, one consumer cooperative, two coal briquette factories, one cooperative shoe-making workshop, one straw rope factory, military dependents service groups, and trust departments, which are estimated to be able to take care of at least 162 military dependents. In addition, they are currently preparing to organize binding, soap making, printing, flour milling, and porterage cooperatives. They once mobilized 107 military dependents to independently complete the 20,000-meter lane road repair work in the district, using work as a form of relief; 31 participated in the Yuhe River repair project. In addition, formal employment was found for 110 skilled people, and temporary production was introduced for 500 unskilled people.

    纠正依赖思想多方组织生产
    京市三区军属大部自力更生
    【本报讯】北京市第三区积极组织烈、荣、军、干属生产，结合进行政治教育，使优抚工作获得成绩。该区有烈、荣、军、干属一千五百四十五户，六千七百三十人。在北京解放之初，由于新参军者的家属政治觉悟不够，大多过分强调优待，有个别军属产生了一种依赖和寄生的思想。
    该区优抚科根据这一情况，虚心听取了他们的意见，了解他们的困难，乃决定组织他们生产和学习。首先是动员了二百五十一名军属参加军属学习班、成人夜校及缝纫工厂学习班、合作社学习班，并在全区十八个街的军属中选出代表及小组长，经常与他们个别谈话和开大会进行教育，表扬觉悟高的，逐渐提高其政治觉悟，发挥其生产劳动积极性。这样，要求享受优待的乃逐渐由三月份的百分之五十五减至十二月份的百分之十八。
    在生产方面，该区首先深入调查军属生产条件及市场情况，发现和培植生产骨干，经过他们开展生产。在生产资金和生产组织上，予以具体的帮助和指导，使生产逐步巩固，走向正规。目前该区已组织了缝纫工厂一，消费合作社一，煤球厂二，合作制鞋社一，草绳工厂一，军属服务组及信托部等生产单位，估计最低能照顾军属一百六十二名。此外现正筹备组织装订、制胰、印刷、磨面及搬运合作社等。他们曾发动军属一百○七名单独完成本区二万公尺的修理胡同马路工作，以工代赈；有三十一名参加修御河工程。此外，为一百一十名有技术的找了正式职业，为五百名无技术的介绍了临时性生产。
