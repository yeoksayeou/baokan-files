Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: TASS Moscow dispatch: In a special article published in Pravda on the 12th, Zaslavsky mocked the situation of Chiang Ting-fu, the representative of the Kuomintang in the United Nations Security Council, saying: Chiang Kai-shek only holds one island in the Pacific—Taiwan—and in the United Nations Security Council, he only holds one Chinese person—Chiang Ting-fu. Chiang Kai-shek is trying to defend Taiwan with American cannons. But who will, and how can they, defend the last representative of the Kuomintang in the United Nations?

Up to now, Chiang Ting-fu has diligently performed his not-so-complex duties. He is a servant of two masters—the United States and Britain. He plays the role of an ancient Chinese toy for them—a nodding tumbler. Chiang Ting-fu, along with the Kuomintang, has become something illusory, an imaginary value, a ghost of the past. It would be simpler to call him "Pshaw, Pshaw," but Chiang Kai-shek clings to Taiwan, and "Pshaw, Pshaw" clings to the Security Council. He is in a tragicomic situation.

Now his masters have different opinions on one issue. The British master says, "Yes, I 'recognize' the People's Republic of China." The American master says, "No, I do not recognize the People's Republic of China." What should a docile servant of two masters do? In fact, there is only one way out: to leave the United Nations organization on his own. But this Kuomintang lackey, trained in the riding school of American and British imperialism, has not yet learned the art of a dignified withdrawal on his own. He is waiting to be carried out as a political zombie, and the fate of a quack is waiting for the Kuomintang, which has already rotted shamefully to the core. Even with the help of American protectors, Mr. "Pshaw, Pshaw" cannot be saved. Even the reactionary American newspapers themselves can't help but laugh when they look at "Pshaw, Pshaw." However, in reality, it's not just "Pshaw, Pshaw" who is laughable. His American protectors are also laughable!

    政治僵尸蒋廷黻将被抬出安理会
    真理报载萨斯拉夫斯基特写
    嘲笑蒋廷黻及其美国保护人
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：萨斯拉夫斯基在真理报十二日刊载的特写中，嘲笑国民党驻联合国安理会代表蒋廷黻的处境称：蒋介石在太平洋上只保有一个岛——台湾，在联合国安理会中只保有一个中国人——蒋廷黻。蒋介石正试图用美国的大炮保卫台湾。但是谁会、而且怎样来保卫国民党在联合国中的最后一个代表呢？
    迄今为止，蒋廷黻已尽职地执行了他并不复杂的职务。他是两个主子——美国和英国——的奴仆。他为它们扮演了中国的古老玩具——频频点头的不倒翁的角色。蒋廷黻已和国民党一起，变成虚无飘渺的东西、想像中的价值、过去的幽灵。现在更简便一些，称他为“呸呸”，但蒋介石死抓住台湾不放，“呸呸”则抓住安理会不放。他正处在一个悲喜剧的处境中。
    现在他的主子们在一个问题上有了不同的意见。英国主子说：“是的，我‘承认’中华人民共和国”。美国主子则说：“不，我不承认中华人民共和国”。作为两个主子的顺从奴仆怎么办呢？实际上只有一条出路：自行离开联合国组织。但是这位美英帝国主义骑术学校训练出来的国民党侍从奴仆，却还没有学会自行体面地撤退的艺术。他正在等待被人当作政治僵尸抬出去，而江湖骗子倒毙的命运，正等待着已经可耻地腐烂透顶的国民党，就是有美国保护人帮忙，也救不了“呸呸”先生。甚至反动的美国报纸自己在注视“呸呸”时，也忍不住要笑起来。不过，实际上可笑的，并不是只有“呸呸”一个人。可笑的还有他的美国保护人！
