    Zhangyuan (Zhangjiakou) Private Flour Milling, Oil Pressing and Other Industries Actively Re-Equipping to Expand Production
    [This newspaper's Zhangjiakou dispatch] After returning from visiting the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition, private industrialists and businessmen in Zhangjiakou are actively improving their industrial equipment. The flour milling and oil pressing industries account for a large proportion of private industry in Zhangjiakou, and with ample raw materials, have great prospects for development. In order to increase flour production, the managers of "Yi Sheng" and "Tong Yi" iron factories have decided to imitate the "Zhonglian-style" flour milling machine displayed at the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition. In conjunction with various private flour mills, they will convert all of the more than 30 existing Japanese-made "Nakajima-style" flour milling machines in Zhangjiakou into "Zhonglian-style" machines. The output of each machine can be increased from 15 bags of flour per day and night to 45 bags. Representatives of the city's private machinery manufacturing industry have now purchased a small flour milling machine from Tianjin as a model, and are preparing to imitate it to provide improved equipment for the city's electric stone mills and animal-powered mills. In order to reduce costs, the private "Yuan Xing Mechanized Oil Pressing Factory" is also actively improving its mechanical equipment. In addition to changing from manual to electric water pumping, it also plans to install electric stir-fry pans. Due to the implementation of a state monopoly on the wine-making industry, all wine-making factories have decided to convert to the oil pressing industry. They are currently raising capital and preparing to go to Tianjin to purchase small "free-style" and "universal-style" oil pressing machines.

    张垣私营面粉榨油等业积极改装设备扩大生产
    【本报张家口专讯】张市私营工商业家参观天津工展归来后，积极改善工业装备。面粉、榨油等业，在张市私营工业中占较大比重，且原料充足，发展前途很大。为提高面粉产量，“义胜”、“同益”两铁工厂经理已决定仿造天津工展陈列之“中联式”面粉机，并结合各私营面粉厂将张市所有旧存三十余台日造“中岛式”面粉机改造成“中联式”，每台机产量可由一昼夜磨面十五袋提高为四十五袋。现该市私营机器制造业代表，从天津购到一部小型面粉机作模样，准备仿制，供张市各电力石磨、畜力磨改良设备。私营“元兴机制榨油厂”为减低成本，亦积极改善机械装备，除改人工抽水为电力抽水外，还计划按置电气炒锅。由于酿酒业实行专卖，各酿酒工厂已决定一律转为榨油业，现正筹措资本，准备赴津购买小型的“自由式”、“万能式”榨油机。
