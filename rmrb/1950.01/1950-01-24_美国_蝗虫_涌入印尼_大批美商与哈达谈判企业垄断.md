Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd—According to TASS, The Hague, 19th: Newspaper reports state that after the establishment of the "United States of Indonesia," representatives of American monopoly capitalists have swarmed into Indonesia like locusts. Fox, the head of the American Fox Corporation, after arriving in Jakarta, has been negotiating with the Sukarno-Hatta group for the past few days. Last week, a large number of American businessmen arrived in Jakarta. It is expected that approximately one thousand more agents of various American monopoly capitalists will arrive soon. The pro-American Sukarno-Hatta group intends to hand over all plantations and enterprises to foreign holders. These plantations and enterprises were nationalized during the time of the Sjahrir Democratic Republic government.

According to Anita News Agency: Fox, who arrived in Indonesia on January 7th, left for London on the 20th. He stated that he would return to Indonesia to continue negotiations on the "Fox Agreement" to monopolize Indonesia's import and export trade as soon as Juanda, the puppet government's Minister of Economic Affairs, returns from the United States.

    美国“蝗虫”涌入印尼
    大批美商与哈达谈判企业垄断
    【新华社北京二十二日电】据塔斯社海牙十九日讯：据报纸消息：在“印尼合众国”成立之后，美国垄断资本家的代表们像蝗虫一样的涌到印尼。美国福克斯大公司的首脑福克斯，在抵达雅加达后，过去几天中曾与苏加诺——哈达集团进行谈判。上周，有大批的美国商人到达雅加达。预料还有约一千名美国各垄断资本家的代理人行将到来。亲美的苏加诺——哈达集团打算将所有的种植园和企业都交给外国持有人。这些种植园和企业在沙利佛丁民主共和国政府时期，曾被收归国有。
    另据安尼塔通讯社消息：一月七日到达印尼的福克斯，于二十日赴伦敦。他表示：一俟印尼傀儡政府经济部长朱安达自美返国时，他将再回印尼，继续谈判垄断印尼进出口贸易的“福克斯协定”。
