[Reported by this newspaper] Pingyuan Provincial People's Government Civil Affairs Director Sun Zhaohuan reported: Pingyuan Province's three months of production and disaster relief work has already achieved many successes and accumulated experience. Last year, Pingyuan Province universally suffered from four major disasters: floods, drought, insects, and hail. After the People's Government led the broad masses in various struggles such as anti-drought planting, insect catching, and flood prevention, the disaster area and the degree of disaster were reduced. However, due to the severity of the disaster, the province still had 7 million mu of land and 2.5 million people (approximately one-seventh of the province's area and population) affected by the disaster. The most severely affected areas were the flood areas along the Yellow River and the lakes (Dongping Lake, Nanyang Lake, Zhaoyang Lake, and Nanwang Lake). In the eight counties in these areas, the flood area included more than 2,000 villages, over 3.2 million mu of cultivated land, and approximately 1.16 million people. In this area, wheat is mostly planted (80-100%), but the wheat harvest was poor (50-100 jin per mu). There was little early autumn harvest, and the late autumn harvest was completely submerged. More than 1,100 villages had houses washed away by the floods (20-100%), with approximately 220,000 families homeless and forced to flee to other areas. Even now, more than 900,000 mu of land have not yet been drained, of which more than 290,000 mu are still 2-3 meters deep in water, a vast expanse (the main reason being the low terrain and the high riverbed, making drainage difficult). The possibility of planting spring wheat is also completely lost. Because most of these areas have suffered cruel destruction by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits over the years, and some areas have suffered four consecutive years of disaster (only one wheat harvest per year or no wheat harvest at all), according to typical surveys, approximately 82% of the total population will run out of food before the old year ends, approximately 8.3% can last until the second month of the lunar calendar this spring, and no more than 9.4% can connect to next year's wheat harvest.

    Through People's Representative Conferences, Universally Mobilize the Masses for Production and Self-Salvation

The main experiences in leading and promoting this work over the past three months are:

    First, using the form of people's representative conferences or people's congresses to implement this work has proven to be a relatively most effective method. People's representative conferences have been universally convened in disaster-stricken counties. Production and disaster relief work is one of the central topics of the meetings. Through people's representatives exchanging information, deliberating plans, and clarifying directions, the representatives directly bring these to the broad masses. In disaster-stricken villages, representative conferences or small-scale mass forums are held to implement the plans, so that the directions can be directly combined with the broad masses, and a mass action will immediately form. For example, in most villages in Shouzhang, the masses regard production as an honor and laziness as a shame. This working method has proven to be more effective in mobilizing the broad masses than simply arranging work within a narrow circle of cadres.

    Second, the analysis of the situation in the disaster area is also the specific work of connecting the production thinking of cadres and the masses. Only by analyzing the specific situation and using accounting methods can the masses in the disaster area understand their situation, find production outlets, and cadres can reverse their condescending views and pessimistic emotions.

    Third, concentrating the positive production examples among the masses to persuade and guide the masses should be a basic working method. Only when the leadership is good at concentrating and promoting the positive aspects of the masses can they guide the masses to look forward, strengthen their confidence, and turn the budding ideas created by a few activists into the actions of the broad masses.

    Finally, the concrete inspection and assistance of higher-level leading organs to the work of lower levels is the main link in realizing leadership. Because this is a work of turning nothing into something and seeking survival from desperation, there are many difficulties. It is necessary to conduct in-depth and specific assistance, and this assistance must be combined with comprehensive inspection and promotion, so that this assistance is not limited to bits and pieces, but the entire work can achieve comprehensive progress through self-top-down inspection and self-bottom-up assistance.

Although preliminary achievements have been made, there are still many difficulties ahead. In overcoming these difficulties, the main problem that needs to be solved currently is still to universally mobilize the broad masses of people in the disaster area, organize them into the production front, promote and spread the existing active creations among the masses, and then provide specific assistance and leadership by leaders at all levels to promote this production self-salvation movement on a broader and deeper scale.

    平原检查三个月生产救灾工作
    领导灾民生产自救  打下渡过春荒基础
    【本报讯】平原省人民政府民政厅长孙照寰报导：平原省三个月来的生产救灾工作已经获得了许多成绩和经验。平原省全省去年普遍遭受了水、旱、虫、雹四大灾害，经过人民政府领导广大群众进行了抗旱点种、捕虫、防汛等各种斗争，灾荒面积与被灾程度虽然缩小了，但终因灾情过重，全省仍有七百万亩土地，和二百五十万人口（约占全省面积和人口七分之一）遭受灾害。其中最严重的则为沿河（黄河）沿湖（东平湖、南阳湖、昭阳湖、南旺湖）的水灾区，在此等地区的八个县中，水灾区就有二千余村，耕地三百二十余万亩，人口约计一百一十六万。这一地区种麦较多（八○—一○○％）麦收不好（一亩五○—一○○斤），早秋很少，晚秋全淹，并有一千一百余村房屋被水冲倒（二○—一○○％）约有二十二万人家室全无，已被迫流离外区；而且直到现在尚有九十万亩土地水未退净，其中有二十九万余亩土地目前尚水深二三公尺，一片汪洋，（主要原因，是地势低洼，河身过高，难以疏出）种春麦的可能亦完全失去。由于这些地区大部分曾经受过历年来日寇和蒋匪的残酷破坏，部分地区且已遭受了四年的连续灾荒（一年只能收一季麦或麦秋全无），根据典型调查，在全人口中约计有百分之八十二，旧年前就要断炊，可以支持到今春旧历二月间者约百分之八·三，能以接上明年麦收者不过百分之九·四。
            通过各界代表会议普遍发动群众生产自救
    三个月来领导与推动这一工作的主要经验是：
    首先，运用各界代表会或人民代表大会的形式贯彻这一工作，已经证明这是比较最有效的办法。在灾区各县已普遍召开了各界代表会，生产救灾工作是会议的中心内容之一，通过人民代表交谈情况，酝酿计划，明确方针，由代表直接带到广大群众中去。在灾区村子里则召开代表会或小型群众座谈会，进行贯彻，使方针与广大群众直接结合，便马上会形成群众性的行动。如寿张大部村庄的群众已以生产为荣，懒闲为耻，这种工作方式已证明比仅仅布置到狭小的干部圈子里，更能有效的发动起广大群众。
    其次，对灾区情况的分析工作，也就是打通干部、群众生产思想的具体工作。只有用分析具体情况和通过算账的办法，才能使灾区群众认识自己的处境，找到生产出路，在干部中才能反掉恩赐观点与悲观情绪。
    再次，集中群众中的积极生产范例，说服与指导群众，这应是个基本的工作方法，只有领导上善于集中与发扬群众中的积极面，才能引导群众向前看，坚定信心，把少数积极分子创造出来的萌芽变成广大群众的行动。
    最后，各级领导机关对下级的工作进行具体检查与帮助，是实现领导的主要环节。因为这是个变无为有、死里求生的工作，困难是很多的，必须进行深入的具体帮助，而这种帮助又必要与全面的检查推动相结合，才能使这种帮助不限于一点一滴，而使整个工作在自上而下的检查与自下而上的帮助之中得到全面的进展。
    目前虽然已获得了初步成绩，但今后的困难还是很多的，在克服这些困难当中，当前需要解决的主要问题，仍然是把广大的灾区人民普遍的发动起来，组织到生产战线中去，发扬与推广群众中现有的积极创造，由各级领导上再加以具体帮助与领导，把这一生产自救运动在更加广泛更加深入的规模上推动起来。
