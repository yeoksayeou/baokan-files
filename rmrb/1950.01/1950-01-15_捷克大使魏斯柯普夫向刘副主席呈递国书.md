Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: Dr. Weisskopf, the first Czechoslovak Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the People's Republic of China, presented his credentials to Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, at 4:30 PM today. Present were Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government, Li Kenong, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of General Staff of the People's Liberation Army. Ambassador Weisskopf delivered a eulogy to Vice Chairman Liu upon presenting his credentials. Vice Chairman Liu delivered a reply. Ambassador Weisskopf's eulogy is as follows:

	Weisskopf's Eulogy: Will continuously develop and deepen the brotherly unity that already exists between Czechoslovakia and China.
"Mr. Chairman:
	I am greatly honored to present to you the credentials commissioning me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, and on behalf of the President of the Czechoslovak Republic and all its people, I extend my warmest respects to Your Excellency.
	I come from Prague, the heart of Central Europe, which is separated by thousands of miles of mountains and rivers from Beijing, the heart of East Asia. But this is merely a geographical distance; because in the realm of thought and feeling, our two capitals, two countries, and two nations are very close to each other. During the arduous years of your great struggle involving long years of bloodshed, we were extremely concerned about your country, because your enemies not only persecuted your country's freedom and independence, but also endangered human dignity and rights. During the Guangzhou Uprising in 1927, our tears mingled at the martyrs' tombs; in 1949, when the victorious banner of the People's Liberation Army rose over the city of Guangzhou, we rejoiced together. For Czechoslovakia, I dare say that China's pain is our pain; China's victory is also the victory of a beloved member of our family.
	My words cannot express how honored I am to be among the first foreign envoys to come to your country and convey to you the Czech people's warm friendship and boundless admiration for your country's final victory—a victory that will undoubtedly be hailed by future historians as the glorious sister of the October Revolution; the dawn of the October Revolution shines on the birth of a true and invincible new era of socialism in human history.
	There is no need to say more about the coordination of our two countries' domestic and foreign policies in basic principles. At this point, allow me to assure Your Excellency that I will do my utmost, with all my meager strength, experience, and talent, to carry out what I consider my main task, which is to continuously develop and deepen the brotherly unity that already exists between Czechoslovakia and our dear, young, strong, and immortal China."

	Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's Reply: Believes that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Czechoslovakia will contribute to lasting world peace.
Vice Chairman Liu's reply is as follows:
"Your Excellency, Mr. Ambassador:
	I am very pleased to accept the credentials presented by Your Excellency, granted by the President of the Czechoslovak Republic, and I thank Your Excellency for the warm congratulations.
	I believe that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China Czechoslovakia will not only further develop and consolidate the friendship that already exists between the people of our two countries, but will also contribute to lasting world peace.
	I warmly welcome Your Excellency as the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Czechoslovak Republic to the People's Republic of China, and I am willing to provide all kinds of assistance in Your Excellency's work to strengthen the close cooperation between our two countries.
	I sincerely wish Your Excellency's country prosperity and its people thriving, and I wish the President of Your Excellency's country good health."

    捷克大使魏斯柯普夫向刘副主席呈递国书
    【新华社北京十四日电】捷克首任驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使魏斯柯普夫博士今日下午四时半向中央人民政府刘少奇副主席呈递国书。在场者有中央人民政府秘书长林伯渠，外交部副部长李克农，人民解放军代总参谋长聂荣臻。魏斯柯普夫大使于呈递国书时并向刘副主席致颂词。刘副主席致答词。魏斯柯普夫大使祝词如下：
            魏斯柯普夫致颂词：将不断发展和加深已存在于捷中之间的兄弟般的团结。“主席先生：
    我很荣幸地在此向您呈递本人受命为特命全权大使的国书的时候，谨代表捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统和全体人民，向阁下致热烈的敬意。
    我来自中欧的心脏布拉格，它和东亚的心脏北京相距万里，山河阻隔。但这不过是地理上的距离而已；因为在思想与感情的领域内，我们两个首都、两个国家、两个民族却彼此非常接近。当你们在长年流血的伟大斗争的艰苦岁月中，我们对贵国极为关怀，因为你们的敌人，不仅迫害贵国的自由和独立，而且危害人类的尊严和权利。一九二七年广州起义时，我们的热泪，在烈士墓前同时交流；一九四九年，解放军胜利的旗帜，在广州城上升起时，我们也一同欢欣鼓舞。对于捷克，我敢说，中国的痛苦，就是我们的痛苦；中国的胜利，也就是我们家庭中亲爱的一员的胜利。
    绝非我的语言所能表达的，是我能参与最先来到贵国的外交代表中，向您转陈，捷克人民以热烈的友情与无限的钦佩，对贵国的最后胜利致敬——这个胜利，无疑地将为明日的历史家称为十月革命的光荣的姊妹；十月革命的黎明的光辉，照耀了人类历史上真正的和不可战胜的社会主义新时代的诞辰。
    我们两国的内政和外交在基本原则上的协调，不需要多说了。至此，让我向阁下保证：我将尽我所有的微薄的力量、经验和才能，来进行我所认为主要的任务，这就是不断地发展和加深已经存在于捷克斯洛伐克和我们亲爱的年轻、强壮、不朽的中国之间的兄弟般的团结。”
            刘少奇副主席致答词：相信中捷建立外交关系，将有助于世界持
        久和平。刘副主席答词如下：“大使先生阁下：
    我很高兴地接受贵大使所递的捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统所授予的国书，并感谢贵大使的热忱的祝贺。
    我相信，中捷两国外交关系之建立，将不仅使已存于两国人民间的友谊日益发展与巩固，同时亦将有助于世界之持久和平。
    我热烈欢迎贵大使出任捷克斯洛伐克共和国驻中华人民共和国首任特命全权大使，并愿在贵大使加强两国亲密合作的工作中予以各种协助。
    谨祝贵国国运昌隆，人民兴旺，并祝贵国总统健康。”
