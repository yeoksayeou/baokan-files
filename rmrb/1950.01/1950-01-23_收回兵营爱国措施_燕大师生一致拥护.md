    Patriotic Measures to Recover Barracks
    Unanimously Endorsed by Teachers and Students of Yenching University
    [Beijing News] Teachers and students of the private Yenching University unanimously endorse the correct measures taken by the Beijing Military Control Commission to recover the land of the former American, French, and Dutch barracks. The professors at Yenching all believe that this is the most gratifying thing for all Chinese people, removing the stain on the nation of the past. The Academic Dean, Weng Dujian, believes: "The American imperialist government distorts the facts and confuses the barracks with the consulate land, which further shows that they are deceiving the American people." The students at Yenching also unanimously feel that this measure was expected, because it represents the will of the people of the whole country. Student Shen Qishao said: "I am very happy to see that the American, French and Dutch barracks land has been recovered. This is the best lesson for imperialism and also encourages our confidence in the revolution." A student Zhang from the Mechanical Engineering Department said: "The recovery of the barracks marks the complete eradication of imperialist privileges in China. Let the American imperialists clamor frantically! The Chinese people stand on the position of protecting the interests of the motherland and are not afraid of any sophistry and threats."
    [Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch] People from all walks of life in Zhangjiakou firmly support the just measures taken by the Beijing Military Control Commission to recover the imperialist barracks land. After the news came, the workers of the Zhangjiakou Machinery Factory organized readings in various workshops on the same day. The director of the factory, who has 16 years of experience, said: "The Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese working class have stood up. No imperialism can ever again run wild and occupy illegal rights and interests in China." Mr. Li Shaofang, representing the business community, happily stated: "The new China of the people will never recognize any unequal treaties concluded by the Kuomintang bandits and foreign imperialists." Spokespersons for the Hebei Province and Zhangjiakou City Women's Federations also issued statements, saying: "This measure taken by the Beijing Military Control Commission shows that in order to protect the integrity of our motherland's territorial sovereignty, we will resolutely sweep away all imperialist privileges in China."
    The reactionary governments of the past invariably ceded land and paid indemnities; only today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have all imperialist privileges been abolished.
    [Our Dispatch] People from all walks of life in Tangshan unanimously cheered and supported the Beijing Military Control Commission's recovery of the former American, French, and Dutch barracks land, and expressed ridicule for the sophistry, slander, and threats of the U.S. State Department. Liu Wanshan, an old worker at the Tangshan Iron Factory, said: "China also has this day to cancel foreign privileges! We are all very happy. We now have a strong force to deal with them. Their calls for withdrawal cannot intimidate people." Guo Shuchang, manager of the Huashengxiang Iron Foundry, and Liu Guoguang, manager of the China Chemical Factory, both said: "No reactionary government in the past decades has ever canceled these aggressive privileges of imperialism. Only under the leadership of Chairman Mao have the people stood up and can resolutely protect the sovereignty of the people's motherland." When the Tangshan People's Bank office was holding an office meeting, they were very happy when they heard the news. All the section chiefs and directors present unanimously expressed that the recovery of the barracks land is supported by the people of the whole country. Yan Tao, chairman of the Jiaotong University Student Union, said: "We find the slander and threats of the American imperialists laughable, because the people of the People's Republic of China are not afraid of any imperialism." Li Chunlin, a teacher at the Provincial Middle School, said: "I fully support the measures of the Beijing Military Control Commission. We should completely and cleanly eliminate the vestiges of imperialist aggression against China." Zhang Peirong, chairman of the Municipal Middle School Student Union, said: "From the Opium War to the rule of the Kuomintang, China has always ceded land and paid indemnities, making it impossible for the Chinese people to stand up. Now it is different. Imperialism can no longer make waves in China." Zhu Qizhang, principal of the Qixin Kailuan Elementary School in the Fifth District Northwest Well, said: "The establishment of barracks by imperialism on Chinese land was a shame in Chinese history. Now the People's Government has quickly recovered it and washed away the shame. I warmly support this measure." Liu Fulai, foreman of the repair shop of Qixin Yanghui Company, said: "This land belongs to the Chinese people, but after it became a concession, imperialism used it to rule the Chinese people. Now it should be taken back." Zhai Ruizhi, a lathe worker, and Wu Junqing, a planer worker, both excitedly said: "This proves that the Chinese people have truly stood up in the world. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can imperialist privileges in China be truly abolished." Yuan Sishi, a worker at the Qixin Porcelain Factory, said: "U.S. Undersecretary of State Bedell Smith's sophistry and slander further prove that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger and cannot intimidate the powerful Chinese people." Zhang Dun, a worker at the Kailuan Tangshan Mine, wrote a letter to the Tangshan Labor Daily, saying: In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries not only did not recover the humiliating barracks but, in order to maintain their rule, continued to harm the Chinese people and signed new traitorous treaties with U.S. imperialism. Now the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, have stood up and established a new country to defend China's territory and sovereignty. The recovery of the barracks land of the United States, France, and the Netherlands by the Capital Military Control Commission is to abolish imperialist privileges in China and to eradicate the old roots of imperialist aggression in China. This is the unanimous demand of the Chinese people, and we workers firmly support this patriotic move.

    【北京讯】私立燕京大学师生一致拥护北京市军事管制委员会对前美、法、荷三国兵营地产收回的正确措施。燕京的教授们，都认为这是全中国人民最痛快的事情，把中国人民过去民族的污点去掉了。教务长翁独健认为：“美国帝国主义政府歪曲事实，将兵营和领事馆地产混淆在一起，更足表明他们是欺骗美国人民的。”燕京的同学们也一致觉得这一措施是意料之中的，因为这是代表全国人民意志的。同学沈其邵说：“我看到美、法、荷兵营地产收回了，这是对帝国主义最好的教训，也鼓励了我们对革命的信心。”机械系同学张某说：“收回兵营，标志着帝国主义在华特权彻底的铲除，让美帝国主义疯狂的叫嚣吧！中国人民站在保护祖国利益的立场上，是不怕一切狡辩和威胁的。”
    【本报张家口电】张家口各界人民坚决拥护北京军管会收回帝国主义兵营地产的正义措施。消息传来后，张家口机器厂的工友们当天就在各车间组织阅读，十六年工龄的该厂主任说：“在中国工人阶级领导下的中国人民已经站起来了，任何帝国主义休想再在中国逞凶，占有非法权益。”李少芳先生代表工商界欢欣地表示：“人民的新中国，决不承认国民党匪帮和外国帝国主义者所订立的一切不平等条约。”察省、张市妇联发言人亦为此发表谈话说：“北京军管会这一措施，表明我们为了祖国领土主权的完整，将坚决扫清一切帝国主义在中国的特权。”
    以前的反动政府一贯割地赔款；只有今天在共产党领导下，才废除了帝国主义一切特权。
    【本报讯】唐山各界人民一致欢呼拥护北京市军管会收回前美、法、荷兵营地产，对美帝国务院的狡辩、诬赖和威胁表示嘲笑。唐山铁工厂老工人刘万善说：“中国今天也有这一天能取消外国特权啦！我们都非常高兴，我们今已经有了雄厚的力量对付他们了，他们的撤退叫嚣威吓不了人。”华盛祥铸铁厂经理郭树昌及中国化学工厂经理刘国光都说：“几十年来那一个反动政府也没有把这帝国主义的侵略性特权取消，只有在毛主席的领导下人民站起来了，才能这样坚决保护人民祖国的主权。唐市人民银行办事处正在举行处务会议时听到这个消息，与会各股长主任都感到非常痛快，一致表示，收回兵营地产是全国人民所赞成的。交大学生会主席阎涛说：“美帝国主义者的诬赖和威胁，我们感到好笑，因为中华人民共和国的人民，是不怕任何帝国主义的。”省立中学教员李春林说：“我十分拥护北京军管会的措施，我们应该把帝国主义侵略中国的遗迹，彻底干净的消灭掉。”市中学生会主席张佩荣说：“自从鸦片战争到国民党统治，中国一直是对外割地赔款，使中国人民永远不能翻身，现在不同了，帝国主义再不能在中国境内兴风作浪了。”五区西北井开滦小学校长朱其章说：“帝国主义在中国土地上设兵营，是中国历史上的耻辱，现在人民政府很快的把它收回，洗净了耻辱，我热烈拥护这个措施。”启新洋灰公司修机厂领班刘福来说：“这些土地是中国人民的，可是变成租借地以后，帝国主义就用来统治中国人民了，现在收回来是应该的。”镟床工人翟瑞芝与刨床工人吴俊清都兴奋的说：“这证明中国人民在世界上真正站立起来了，只有在中国共产党领导下，才能真正废除帝国主义在华特权。”启新磁厂工人袁思十说：“美国国务院副国务卿白德华的狡辩与诬赖，更证明美帝国主义是一只纸老虎，是威吓不了强大的中国人民的。”开滦唐山矿井上工人张钝给唐山劳动日报投稿写道：过去国民党反动派不但不收回丧权辱国的兵营，反而为了维持他们的统治地位，继续陷害中国人民，与美帝国主义订立新的卖国条约。现在中国人民在毛主席领导下，已经站起来了，建立了新的国家，来保卫中国的领土和主权。首都军管会收回美、法、荷的兵营地产是废除帝国主义在中国的特权，也是铲除了帝国主义在中国侵略的老根子，这是中国人民一致的要求，我们工人坚决拥护这一爱国举动。
