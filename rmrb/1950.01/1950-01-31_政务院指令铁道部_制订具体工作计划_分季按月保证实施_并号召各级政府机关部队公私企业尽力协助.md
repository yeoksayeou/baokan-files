Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th—The State Council of the Central People's Government issued a directive on the 29th regarding the implementation of the Ministry of Railways' 1950 work plan. The full text is as follows:

    The 14th meeting of the State Council listened to the report by Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan on the 1950 railway work plan. It was considered that the railway work in 1949 made great achievements in repairing railways and bridges, completing military transportation and passenger and freight transport tasks, and supporting the war and national economic recovery, and enhancing material exchange. The Ministry of Railways' 1950 guiding principle of restoring railways that have not yet opened to traffic, strengthening essential technical equipment on railways that have been repaired to ensure the necessary transportation tasks, is correct. The State Council has approved this guiding principle and all its transportation and construction plans.

    The Ministry of Railways should immediately formulate a more specific work plan for 1950 based on the approved plan outline, and guarantee its implementation by quarter and month, ensuring that human, material, and financial resources are allocated and used accurately and rationally.

    The State Council requires all railway workers, staff, and engineers across the country, with the spirit of loving the motherland and assisting the government in rapidly restoring the national economy, to offer opinions on the implementation, supplementation, and revision of the Ministry of Railways' 1950 plan, and ensure its implementation.

    The railway work task for 1950 is very arduous. But it is entirely possible to achieve. The State Council calls on all railway workers, staff, engineers, and all commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps to bravely shoulder the glorious task entrusted by the state, strengthen the planning and organization in their work. Continue to learn from the advanced experience of Soviet railways, strive to overcome the shortcomings in past work, prevent traffic accidents, consolidate labor discipline, launch production competitions, widely disseminate the achievements and working methods of labor heroes and advanced workers, and conduct serious struggle against all elements of dereliction of duty, irresponsibility, violation of discipline, waste of state property, and failure to strive to complete tasks. Under unified planning and leadership, strive forward step by step and with planning.

    The State Council also calls on all levels of government, agencies, troops, public and private enterprises to give the railways their full assistance, promptly supply the railways' needs, strictly abide by railway regulations, and highly organize and plan transportation, ensuring loading and unloading at the specified times and at night. At the same time, organize the people in various regions to collect and donate railway materials scattered in various places to save state expenditures, complete railway construction tasks, and promote the rapid recovery and development of the national economy.

    【新华社北京三十日电】中央人民政府政务院于二十九日发布关于实现铁道部一九五○年工作计划的指令，全文如下：
    政务院第十四次会议听取了铁道部滕代远部长关于一九五○年铁路工作计划的报告，认为一九四九年的铁路工作，在修复铁路、桥梁，完成军运及客货运输任务，对支援战争及国家经济恢复，增强物资交流，是有很大成绩的。铁道部一九五○年以恢复尚未通车的铁路，补强已修复的铁路上必不可少的技术设备，以保证必须负担的运输任务为主的方针，是正确的。政务院对这个方针及其全部运输、修建计划，已予批准。
    铁道部应即根据已批准的计划概要，制定一九五○年更具体的工作计划，并分季度、月别保证实施，务使人力、物力、财力作到精确合理的分配与使用。
    政务院要求全国铁路工人、职员、工程师，本爱护祖国、协助政府迅速恢复国家经济的精神，对铁路部一九五○年计划提出实现、补充以及修正的意见，保证实行。
    一九五○年的铁路工作任务是很艰巨的。但是完全可能实现的。政务院号召全国铁路工人、职员、工程师、铁道兵团全体指战员，勇敢地负起国家所付的光荣任务，加强工作中的计划性、组织性。继续学习苏联铁路的先进经验，努力克服过去工作中的缺点，防止行车事故，巩固劳动纪律，开展生产竞赛，广泛传播劳动英雄与先进工作者的业绩和工作方法，对一切渎职、不负责任、破坏纪律、浪费国家财产和不努力完成任务的分子，应进行严肃的斗争。在统一的计划领导下，有步骤、有计划地努力前进。
    政务院并号召各级政府、机关、部队、公私企业尽力给铁路以协助，及时供应铁路需要，严格地遵守铁路规章，高度地组织与计划运输，作到按照规定时间装卸与夜间装卸。同时，组织各地人民搜集与献纳散在各处的铁路器材，以节省国家开支，完成铁路修建任务，促进国家经济的迅速恢复与发展。
