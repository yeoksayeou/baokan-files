Fellow citizens of Beijing!

It has been a year since the liberation of Beijing. What exactly has the Municipal People's Government done in this year? Primarily: establishing and consolidating revolutionary order, restoring and developing production, and restoring and developing the people's cultural and educational undertakings. In addition, we have also done some work in municipal construction, but it has not been as much as we would have liked due to limitations of objective conditions and our own capabilities. This is because if social order is not sufficiently consolidated and production is not sufficiently restored, it would be putting the cart before the horse to focus primarily on municipal construction. Therefore, since liberation, our work has focused on establishing and consolidating social order and actively restoring and developing production, especially the restoration and development of production, which has become our overriding central task. Municipal construction can only be done to the extent that the people urgently need it and the government's resources allow. It is impossible to "revive everything at once." Separate articles and reports have already been written on the three main tasks; here, I will only briefly describe some of the main work done in municipal construction.

First, our work in clearing garbage and construction projects has been quite successful. For example, under extremely difficult conditions of funding and technology, we cleared 339,142 tons of garbage in the past year, clearing away the more than 200,000 tons of garbage that had accumulated before liberation. This is almost a miracle in the eyes of long-time residents of Beijing. For example, in road construction, we have built 100,8123 square meters of various high-quality road surfaces in the past year, including the main lines from the Summer Palace to Fragrant Hills, Guang'anmen Street, Xuanwai Street, Chaoyang Street, and Sanlihe to Dongliushujing. In contrast, during the three years and three months of Kuomintang reactionary rule, only 90,620 square meters of new road surface were built. Comparing the two, our work in one year has exceeded the total amount of work done by them in three years and three months by 17,503 square meters. We were able to achieve such results mainly because of the broad and active support of the People's Liberation Army, workers, students, and the vast majority of citizens. The troops stationed in Beijing helped us repair the city walls of the inner and outer cities, and the Communist Youth League mobilized thousands of young students and young workers to participate in voluntary labor and participate in the opening of Tiananmen Square and Jianguomen leading to the eastern suburbs. We are very grateful for these contributions. We welcome them to continue to participate in various work in future construction work. In addition, the fact that our staff can significantly improve work efficiency and save materials is also one of the reasons why our work has achieved results. For example, the municipal construction engineering team of the Construction Bureau used to require an average of 0.8 man-days per square meter for fried oil and cement road projects, but now only requires 0.5 man-days; coal consumption for steam rollers has been reduced from 300 kilograms to 250 kilograms per day; when cars and steam rollers were taken over, only two of each were able to run, but after the workers used old and discarded materials to repair and renovate them, the number of cars has now increased to 15 and the number of steam rollers has increased to 14. Another example is that the cleaning team of the Public Health Bureau had and still has 1,800 people, but in the past, there were more than 200,000 tons of accumulated garbage, while in the past year, the cleaning team collected more than 40,000 tons of household garbage, and only less than 2,000 tons remain in the waiting area.

Secondly, our work in tap water and sewers has also achieved some results. The tap water situation in this city was very bad in the past. Our work in this area has mainly focused on repairing water pipes, expanding the number of users, and reducing water prices, but gradually carrying out planned construction is still something for the future. At present, the daily production of tap water in Beijing is about 65,000 tons, and the total amount of water distribution, that is, the amount of water that is fed into the main pipes in the city through the clear water pool of the water company, is about 30,000 tons per day, accounting for only 46 percent of the water production. In December last year, there were 33,435 water users and 190 retail water stations in the city. According to the estimated water supply per capita, only about 40 percent of the population in the city can get tap water. In order to expand the number of users and ensure that citizens can use clean tap water at low prices, we have repeatedly reduced the price of water. In February last year, when we first entered the city, the price of each ton of water was equivalent to two catties of millet, and in May, the price of water was only equivalent to one and a half catties of millet. In December, we reduced the price of water again. Except for commercial users who still maintain the original price of one and a half catties of millet, the price of each ton of water for households, institutions, troops, and schools is only one catty of millet, while the price of public water, such as bathhouses, is only 0.75 catties of millet per ton. There has been progress in leak detection and repair of water pipes. According to statistics from May to December, the amount of leakage reduced in the past eight months is about 1,900 tons. The sewer situation in this city is worse than tap water. The total length of streets in the city is 755 kilometers, and the streets known to have sewers are 246 kilometers, accounting for only one-third of the total length of streets. Many streets, especially those where working people live, do not have sewers. Among the existing sewers, due to years of disrepair and severe siltation, the total amount of silt is estimated to be about 160,000 cubic meters. This has a serious impact on the city's environmental sanitation. Even fewer citizens have sewer facilities, accounting for only about 3 percent of the total number of households. In the past year, our projects have focused on maintenance on the one hand, that is, excavating, dredging, and repairing various open and closed ditches, as well as rain outlets on the main roads of the city, excavating a total of 13,770 cubic meters of ditch mud; on the other hand, new construction, including more than 2,577 meters of tank pipe ditches, 95.5 meters of cement pipe ditches, 123 exploration wells, 115 rain outlets, and 3 large seepage wells and sedimentation tanks.

Third, we have done our best to carry out epidemic prevention work for citizens and the management of food and beverages. In terms of epidemic prevention work, in addition to carrying out various seasonal vaccinations, in late October last year, due to the discovery of plague in Chahar, we immediately organized an epidemic prevention committee and launched a plague prevention campaign. The plague prevention campaign lasted for more than 40 days, with thousands of medical workers and government cadres participating in the work, so that 41 percent of the citizens received effective vaccinations, and extensive publicity and education work was carried out. This epidemic prevention campaign was unprecedented in Beijing, not only completing the task of preventing the plague from invading the capital, but also establishing the city's grassroots health organization - health groups with ten households as a unit. In terms of the management of food and beverages, the Health Bureau has continuously carried out inspections, improvements, and disinfection of well water and tap water, and strengthened the management of cold drinks and food items, so the number of deaths due to gastrointestinal diseases has been significantly reduced. In May of the year before last, under the Kuomintang reactionary rule, deaths due to gastrointestinal diseases accounted for 14 percent of the total deaths in the city, while last year it has been reduced to just over 9 percent. Of course, the work is still far from enough and needs to be strengthened. In addition, in the past year, the Health Bureau has eliminated 890 cesspools, manure boxes, and manure plants in the city, and moved about 610,000 tons of stored manure outside the city, which has also significantly improved the city's sanitation environment.

Finally, the situation in traffic management and traffic construction has also improved. In the second half of last year, the number of vehicles increased, but the number of traffic accidents decreased much more than in the first half of the year. In the past, trams had to wait for more than 15 minutes before there was a tram. Now, on the main lines, there is a tram every seven minutes, which facilitates the use of working people and achieves the purpose of serving production. The number of buses has also increased, but in order to take care of the off-season business of rickshaws in winter, in addition to increasing the prices of buses and trams, only more than 20 buses have been put into operation for the time being. After the problem of rickshaw drivers changing careers is properly resolved, the number will be increased again.

The work we have done in municipal construction in the year since liberation is mainly these, and can only be these. This year, our central task is still to restore and develop production. It is even more overwhelming in our work. Municipal construction is still unlikely to be put first. This is because our production has not been sufficiently restored and developed. Only when production is sufficiently restored and developed will municipal construction have a foundation. But it is also certain that we will do more municipal construction work this year than last year, because both objective conditions and subjective forces have improved compared to last year. We are drafting a plan, which will be announced soon. In order to achieve our plan, we not only need to make great efforts ourselves, but also need the continued and active support of the vast majority of citizens. Without this support, our task will not be easy to complete.

Fellow citizens of Beijing! In order to complete the great task of building the capital, let us work together and move forward!

    解放一年来北京市的市政建设
    ——张友渔副市长广播演讲词
    全北京市市民同胞们！
    北京解放已经一年了。这一年以来，市人民政府究竟做了些什么工作呢？主要是：建立与巩固革命秩序，恢复与发展生产、恢复与发展人民的文化教育事业。此外，在市政建设上，我们也做了一些工作，但为客观条件和主观力量所限制，做得不够多。这是因为如果社会秩序不相当巩固，生产不相当恢复，而首先致力于市政建设，那就未免有些本末倒置。所以解放以来，我们的工作重点是建立与巩固社会秩序，积极恢复与发展生产，特别是恢复与发展生产日益成为我们压倒一切的中心工作。市政建设当然只能在人民所迫切需要而又为政府人力财力所能及的范围内，做一些。要想“百废俱举”，是不可能的。关于三项主要工作已另有专文和报告，我在这里，只是就市政建设方面的主要工作，略述一二。
    首先，我们在清除垃圾和建设工程方面的工作是有相当成绩的。比如我们在经费与技术条件极端困难的情况下，一年来，清除了垃圾三十三万九千一百四十二吨，把解放以前积存的二十余万吨垃圾一举扫清。这在久居北京的市民看来，差不多是奇迹。又比如我们在修建道路方面，一年来，新建各种高级路面，包括颐和园到香山，广安门大街，宣外大街，朝阳大街及三里河到东柳树井等干线共计十万零八千一百二十三平方公尺，而国民党反动派统治时期，在三年又三个月间，新建路面才不过九万零六百二十平方公尺。两者比较起来，我们一年间的工作超过了它三年又三个月加起来的总数达一万七千五百零三平方公尺之多。我们所以能够获得这样的成绩，主要是依靠人民解放军、工人、学生、和广大市民的广泛而积极的支持。驻京部队曾经协助我们修整内、外城的城墙，青年团曾经发动上千的青年学生和青年工人实行义务劳动，参加开辟天安门广场和通到东郊的建国门。这些都是我们非常感佩的。并且在今后的建设工作当中，还欢迎他们继续参加各种工作。此外，我们的工作人员能够相当提高工作效率和节约器材，也是使我们的工作获得成绩的原因之一。例如建设局的市政建设工程队，过去做炒油和水泥路工程，每平方公尺平均需要零点八个人工，现在只需要零点五个人工；汽碾用煤由每天三百公斤减到二百五十公斤；汽车和汽碾在接管时只各有两部能够行驶，经过工人利用旧废器材整理修复，现在汽车已经增到十五部，汽碾已经增到十四部。又如公共卫生局的清洁总队过去和现在都是一千八百人，但过去积存的垃圾是二十余万吨，而这一年来，清洁总队收集的户内垃圾四万多吨，在待运场积存下来的只有不到两千吨了。
    其次，在自来水和下水道方面，我们的工作也收到一些成绩。本市自来水情况过去很不好。我们在这方面所做的工作，主要是修补水管，扩大用水户并减低水价，但逐步进行有计划的建设，还是今后的事情。现在北京的自来水，每天产水量约为六万五千吨，而配水总量，就是经过自来水公司的清水池配入城内各干管的水量，每天约为三万吨，仅占产水量的百分之四十六。全市的用水户，去年十二月份为三万三千四百三十五户，零售水站为一百九十处，按人口给水来估计，市内大约只有百分之四十的人口可以吃到自来水。为了扩大用水户，保证市民能够廉价用到清洁的自来水，我们一再地把水价减低了。去年二月份，我们刚一进城的时候，每一公吨水价折合二斤小米，五月份的水价就只折合一斤半小米了。十二月份，我们再减低水价，除了商户用水仍维持一斤半小米的原价以外，住户、机关、部队、学校用水每公吨只要小米一斤，而公共用水，譬如澡堂用水，每公吨只收水价零点七五斤小米了。在水管的检漏修漏方面，是有成绩的，据从五月份到十二月份的统计，八个月来减少漏水量约为一千九百多公吨。本市下水道的情况比自来水还坏。全市街道共长七百五十五公里，确知有下水道的街道为二百四十六公里，仅占街道总长的三分之一。许多街道特别是劳动人民聚居的区域没有下水道。而在现有的下水道中间，由于年久失修，淤塞严重，估计总淤泥量约在十六万立方公尺左右。这对于市内环境卫生是有严重影响的。至于市民有下水道设备者更少，仅占总户数百分之三左右。一年来，我们进行的工程，一方面是保养，即掏挖疏浚及修整各式明沟暗沟，以及全城主要干路雨水口，共掏出沟泥一万三千七百七十公方；一方面是新建，计有缸管沟二千五百七十七公尺多，水泥管沟九十五公尺半，探井一百二十三座，雨水口一百十五座，大型渗水井及沉淀池各三座。
    第三，我们曾经尽力进行了市民防疫工作和饮食物品的管理。在防疫工作方面，除了进行各种季节性的防疫注射以外，去年十月下旬，由于察北发现了鼠疫，我们当即组织了防疫委员会，展开了预防鼠疫的工作。预防鼠疫的运动前后进行了四十多天，有成千的医务工作者和机关干部参加了这一工作，使百分之四十一的市民得到了有效的预防注射，并且进行了广泛的宣传教育工作。这次防疫运动，在北京是空前的，不但完成了预防鼠疫，使它不能侵入首都的任务，而且建立了全市的基层的卫生组织——以十户为单位的卫生小组。在饮食物的管理方面，卫生局不断地进行了井水和自来水的检验，改善和消毒，并且加强了清凉饮食物品的管理，所以因肠胃病致死的人数已经显著减少了。前年五月，在国民党反动统治下，全市死亡人口里面因肠胃病致死的占百分之十四，而去年已经减少到百分之九强了。当然，工作还做得很不够，还需要加强。另外，一年来，卫生局取消了城内的粪坑、粪箱、粪厂八百九十个，把所存大粪约六十一万余吨搬到城外，也使本市的卫生环境得到了相当的改善。
    最后，在交通管理和交通建设方面，情况也已有所改善。去年后半年车辆有所增加，而车祸却较前半年减少多了。电车的行驶，过去要等十五分钟以上才有一趟车，现在在主要干线上已做到每七分钟一趟车，这样就便利了劳动人民的乘用，达到为生产服务的目的。公共汽车也增多了，但为了照顾三轮车冬季生意的清淡，除了提高公共汽车，和电车的票价外，暂时只开行了二十多辆，俟三轮车夫转业问题得到适当解决后，再行增加。
    解放一年来，我们在市政建设方面所做的工作主要就是这些，也只能是这些。今年，我们的中心工作仍然是恢复与发展生产。它在我们的工作中更加处于压倒一切的地位。市政建设仍然不可能摆在第一位。这是因为我们的生产还恢复与发展得很不够。只有生产得到足够的恢复与发展，市政建设才有了根基。但今年我们将比去年更多做一些市政建设工作却也是肯定的，因为客观条件和主观力量都较去年有所改善了。我们正在草拟计划，不久，当可宣布。为了实现我们的计划，不仅需要我们自身作极大的努力，而且需要广大市民继续给予我们以积极的支持。没有这个支持，我们的任务是不易完成的。
    全北京市的市民同胞们！为了完成建设首都的伟大任务，让我们共同努力前进吧！
