    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 27th: TASS, Moscow: Pravda commentator Mayevsky wrote an article on the 24th commenting on the secret talks held in Bonn between French Foreign Minister Schuman and West German puppet Prime Minister Adenauer. The commentary pointed out that the American partners of the French imperialists, now that they are confident of the subservience of the French ruling clique, are clearly planning to once again use the Saar issue to pursue their own aims. But this time they are posing as friends of the German people. In its military adventurist plans, U.S. imperialism has designated the German people to serve as cannon fodder, and is again using the Saar issue as a bargaining chip. It is in this context that Schuman is attempting to resolve the Saar issue through direct negotiations with Adenauer.
    Adenauer pretends to "advocate" maintaining Germany's integrity, but at the same time makes it understood that he would be willing to separate the Saar from Germany if the price is high enough. However, because Schuman has not been able to offer a high enough price, the Saar issue remains unresolved.
    The commentary continued that the failure of Schuman's talks with Adenauer was to be expected, because the policies of the Bonn ruling clique and the Bonn puppet are decided in Washington. The price of the Saar must also be determined in Washington.
    In conclusion, the commentary emphasized that Bonn's shameless deal has aroused the indignation of the German people. The attitude of the majority of the German people towards this deal is reflected in the statement issued by Foreign Minister Dodinger of the German Democratic Republic on the issue of France's annexation of the Saar.

    美帝利用萨尔问题追逐自己侵略目的
    真理报斥波恩无耻交易
    【新华社北京二十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报评论员马耶夫斯基二十四日撰文评法外长舒曼与西德傀儡总理阿登纳在波恩举行的秘密谈判。评论指出法帝国主义者的美国伙伴，因为对法国统治集团的驯服一点上已确有把握，显然打算再度利用萨尔问题来追逐自己的目的。但这一次却是装做德国人民的朋友。美帝国主义在其军事冒险计划中，指定德国人民充当炮灰，并再度把萨尔问题作为讨价还价的武器。舒曼就在这种情况下，企图经过直接与阿登纳的谈判，来解决萨尔问题。
    阿登纳装做是“主张”维持德国的完整，但同时却又使人了解到，只要有高的代价，他是会把萨尔割离德国的。不过由于舒曼尚未能出高价，萨尔问题便悬而不决。
    评论继称，舒曼与阿登纳商谈的失败是预料得到的。因为波恩统治集团的政策以及波恩傀儡的政策，是在华盛顿决定的。萨尔的价钱，也要在华盛顿确定。
    最后，评论强调指出，波恩的无耻交易激起了德国人民的愤慨，大多数德国人民对这一交易的态度，反映于德意志民主共和国外长窦丁格尔就法国并吞萨尔问题所发表的声明中。
