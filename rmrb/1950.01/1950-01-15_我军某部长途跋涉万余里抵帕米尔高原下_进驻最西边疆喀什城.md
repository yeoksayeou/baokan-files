    Our Army's Unit Marches Over Ten Thousand Li to the Foot of the Pamir Plateau
    Garrisoning Kashgar City, the Westernmost Frontier
    [Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 14th] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, after marching over ten thousand li, entered Kashgar City (the combined name of Shule and Shufu), located at the foot of the Pamir Plateau, the westernmost border of Xinjiang, last month, and was warmly welcomed by the local people. After this army cooperated with fraternal units in eliminating four armies of bandit troops in the Feng (county) and Mei (county) area of Shaanxi in July of last year, it took Lanzhou and Xining in one fell swoop, and then garrisoned Xinjiang, marching more than 11,000 li. The soldiers carried weapons, ammunition, food, and firewood on their backs, crossed the Qilian Mountains, which are thousands of meters above sea level and covered with snow all year round, forded the Datong River in the Qilian Mountain Valley amidst wind, snow, and hail, crossed hundreds of miles of uninhabited Qinghai grassland, stepped out of Jiayuguan, and passed through the Gobi desert with flying sand and rocks, finally victoriously reaching Kashgar City. During such arduous long-distance marches, although half of the people had blisters on their feet, no one fell behind. Many companies even created a new record of marching 180 li a day. The people of Kashgar expressed their infinite love for this People's Liberation Army that had come from ten thousand li away. Last month, they held a grand rally to celebrate the peaceful liberation and welcome the People's Liberation Army, and Commissioner Abudukrim presented a flag to the Liberation Army on behalf of all circles in Kashgar. The conference also sent a salute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.

    我军某部长途跋涉万余里抵帕米尔高原下
    进驻最西边疆喀什城
    【新华社迪化十四日电】人民解放军某军经过万余里的长途跋涉，已于上月进驻新疆最西的边境帕米尔高原下的喀什城（即疏勒、疏附两城合称），受到当地人民的热烈欢迎。该军自去年七月配合兄弟部队在陕西扶（风）郿（县）地区消灭胡匪四个军后，乘胜直取兰州和西宁，继即进驻新疆，行军一万一千余里。战士们曾背着武器、弹药、粮食和柴火，越过拔海数千公尺终年积雪的祁连山，在风雪冰雹交加中涉过祁连山谷中的大通河，穿过数百里荒无人烟的青海草原，跨出嘉峪关，通过飞沙走石的戈壁瀚海，终于胜利进抵喀什城。在这样艰苦的长途行军中，虽然半数的人脚都打了泡，但仍没有一个掉队的。许多连队且创造了日行一百八十里的新纪录。喀什人民对这一支万里远来的人民解放军表示了无限的爱戴，曾于上月举行了庆祝和平解放暨欢迎人民解放军的盛大集会，由专员阿不都可日木代表喀什各界向解放军献旗。大会并电毛主席和朱总司令致敬。
