    Taiwan Democratic League North China General Branch
    Calls on League Members to Purchase Public Bonds
    Actively Participate in the Liberation of Taiwan

    [This newspaper reports] The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League's North China General Branch issued a letter to all league members yesterday (5th), titled "Repaying Our Motherland," calling on them to enthusiastically purchase victory bonds. The original text is as follows:

    "To all League members: We all know that this year is a year of victory, a year to thoroughly liberate Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet, to complete the victory, and consolidate the victory. In order to accomplish this enormous task, the people of the whole country have endured hardship and persevered in a hard struggle unprecedented in history.

    We must understand that Taiwan can be liberated because the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have formed a revolutionary great unity. Taiwan can only achieve complete liberation within the great family of the Chinese people, and we must thank the people of the whole country.

    Today marks the beginning of the issuance of the first tranche of the 1950 People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds, the purpose of which is to rapidly liberate all of China, complete the victory, restore and develop production, and consolidate the victory. This is the most concrete action to test whether each of our comrades truly loves our motherland, and this is the best opportunity for us to repay our great motherland.

    We call on all League members to subscribe to real value public bonds, demonstrate our infinite loyalty to the motherland, actively participate in the liberation of Taiwan, support the front lines, and quickly rescue our fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters from their suffering!"
