Tens of thousands of Berlin laborers marched in an endless stream past the platform erected in front of the graves of Liebknecht and Luxemburg, for almost three hours. The demonstrators held high banners and slogans such as: "Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg are the most advanced fighters against militarism and war!"
