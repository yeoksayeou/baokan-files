Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 30th: TASS, Moscow, January 28th: Pravda's Paris correspondent, Zhukov, reports: The French people, who support peace, are intensifying their struggle against the production and transportation of armaments. Dockworkers in all major ports have unanimously decided not to handle American military supplies. This batch of military supplies, under the infamous American aid Marshall Plan, is soon to arrive in France. Workers in many enterprises have refused to do any work related to the production of armaments. At the same time, a movement to support workers who refuse to work for war is unfolding across the country. Workers, farmers, and office staff are providing material assistance to unemployed dockworkers. The unemployed dockworkers are enduring threats to their livelihoods but remain determined to refuse to work for war.

	Saint-Nazaire Port Workers Strike to Protest American Warship Entering Port
In the face of the vast united front of working people fighting for peace, the French reactionaries and their American masters are clearly panicked and becoming more frantic. The American warship "Power" was ordered to sail to Saint-Nazaire, which had initiated the refusal to handle American military supplies. However, the working people of Saint-Nazaire resisted this provocative act with resolute struggle. When the American warship entered the port, there was not a single dockworker on the dock, only sentry posts of the so-called "Republican Guard" standing there. When American sailors entered the city, the workers distributed leaflets to them, which read: "Suppress the madmen and criminals of Wall Street, and we can suppress our own madmen and criminals. Act together, and we will win peace." At the same time, workers in Saint-Nazaire held a strike to protest the arrival of the American warship.

On the other hand, the French Council of Ministers also met under the chairmanship of President Auriol and, on the advice of De Gaulle's supporters and right-wing Socialists, passed a resolution to use police suppression and even severe measures against workers who refuse to produce war materials, and stipulated that workers and staff who refuse to produce, load, and transport armaments should be dismissed. The Minister of Justice, Mayer, is hastily preparing a bill to "supplement the laws suppressing sabotage to make them applicable to the current situation." The government has also decided to suppress democratic newspapers. The Director of Information has been instructed to immediately propose a bill "prohibiting one person from serving as both the editor of a newspaper and a member of parliament."

However, the democratic people of France, fighting for peace, have not only not succumbed to the government's threats, but have responded with intensified struggle. A congress of 30,000 peace supporters was held in Paris to protest the "dirty war" in Vietnam and strongly expressed their indignation at this threat. In many parts of the country, workers have gone on strike, demanding the recall of the expeditionary force from Vietnam and the conversion of military enterprises to peaceful uses. Democratic newspapers have vehemently protested the government's decision, considering it to be unconstitutional.

    法人民加紧争取和平斗争，拒绝生产和运输军备。
    【新华社北京三十日电】据塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：真理报驻巴黎记者朱可夫报道：法国拥护和平的人民，正在加紧斗争，以反对军备的生产和运输。各最大港口的码头工人一致决定不搬运美国的军备物资。根据臭名昭彰的美国援助马歇尔化国家的计划，这批军备物资不久即将运抵法国。许多企业的工人，已拒绝作任何有关军备生产的工作，同时，声援拒绝为战争而工作的工人运动，正在国内展开。工人、农民与职员纷纷给予失业的港口工人以物质援助。失业的港口工人则忍受生活威胁，仍坚决拒绝为战争工作。
            圣那最尔港工人罢工抗议美国军舰驶进港口
    在劳动人民为和平而斗争的巨大联合阵线面前，法国反动派及其美国主子显然是张皇失措并更为疯狂了。美国军舰“权力”号受命驶往发动了拒绝处理美国军事物资的圣那最尔港，但是，圣那最尔的劳动人民以沉着的斗争抗拒了这一挑衅行为，当美国军舰驶入该港时，码头上没有一个码头工人，只有所谓“共和国保安队”的哨岗站在那里。当美国海员入城时，工人们却向他们散发传单，传单上写着：“压止住华尔街的疯子与罪犯，我们就能压止住我们自己的疯子与罪犯。共同行动，我们将赢得和平。”与此同时，圣那最尔的工人举行了抗议美国军舰驶来的罢工。
    另一方面，法国部长会议亦在总统阿里奥尔的主持下开会，并根据戴高乐支持者与右翼社会党人的建议通过一项决议，对拒绝生产战争物资的工人，将使用警察镇压以至严厉的办法，并规定拒绝生产、装运与输送军备的工人与职员应予解雇。司法部长迈耶正在赶忙准备一项法案，以“补充镇压怠工的法律，使之适用于今日的状况”。政府还决定压制民主报纸，新闻局长已受命立即提出一项法案，“禁止一人兼任报纸主编与国会议员”。
    可是，为和平而斗争的法国民主人民，不仅没有向政府的威胁屈服，而且用加紧的斗争来回答它。巴黎举行了三万名和平拥护者的大会，抗议在越南进行的“肮脏的战争”，并强烈地表示他们对于这一威胁的愤慨。在全国的许多地方，工人们举行罢工，要求自越南召回远征军，并把军用企业转用于和平用途上。民主报纸猛烈抗议政府的决定，认为它是违反宪法的。
