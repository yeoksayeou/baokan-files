Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 13th: The Albanian people warmly celebrated the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic on the 11th. In the past four years, with the assistance of the great friendship of the Soviet Union, the Albanian people have achieved brilliant successes in economic and cultural construction. According to the Albanian News Agency, the Albanian people are working diligently to transform Albania from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, and have opened up a path to socialism.

	In the past four years, Albania's industries and mines have been equipped with new equipment. Due to large investments and the selfless labor of the people, industrial production in 1949 was 431 percent of the 1938 level. The production of the mining industry was 342 percent of the pre-war level. A foundation for large-scale construction was laid in 1949.

	In agriculture, the pre-war level has been exceeded by 65 percent. Livestock breeding has exceeded it by 90 percent. For the first time, farmers are enjoying the services and scientific guidance of machines and tractor stations. Albania now has 58 agricultural cooperatives. The cultivated area is 300 percent of the pre-war level.

	Trade relations with the Soviet Union have played a significant role in Albanian life, because the Soviet Union has supplied Albania with the equipment needed for factories and the equipment needed to build new industrial enterprises. Albania's exports have also increased significantly.

	The People's Republic pays special attention to public health and education. The number of primary and secondary schools is more than three times that of the pre-war period. In a population of more than one million, the number of students in 1949 increased to 181,000, while in 1938 there were only 58,000. And for the first time, a higher education institution - a teachers college - was established. Art and culture have also achieved great success.

    阿热烈庆祝国庆
    四年来工业生产为战前四倍多  农业已超过战前百分之六十五
    【新华社北京十三日电】阿尔巴尼亚人民于十一日热烈庆祝人民共和国成立四周年纪念。四年以来，阿国人民在苏联伟大友谊的援助下，在经济文化建设方面已获得辉煌成就。据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚人民正在勤劳地工作，使阿国从落后的农业国变成先进的工业国，并开辟了通到社会主义的道路。
    四年来，阿尔巴尼亚的工业与矿场，已获得新式装备。由于大量的投资和人民忘我的劳动，一九四九年的工业生产为一九三八年水平的百分之四百三十一。采矿工业的生产为战前的百分之三百四十二。一九四九年已奠定了大规模建设的基础。
    农业方面，已超过战前水平百分之六十五。牲畜饲养方面则超过百分之九十。农民第一次享受到机器与拖拉机站的服务和科学的指导。阿尔巴尼亚现在已有五十八个农业合作社。耕地面积为战前百分之三百。
    和苏联的贸易关系，在阿尔巴尼亚生活中，起了很大作用。因为苏联供应了阿尔巴尼亚工厂所需的装备和建设新工业企业所需的装备。阿尔巴尼亚的输出也已大大增加。
    人民共和国特别注意公共健康和教育。初等学校和中等学校的数目，已相当于战前的三倍多。在一百余万人口中，学生的数目在一九四九年已增加到十八万一千名，而在一九三八年只有五万八千名。并且第一次成立了高等教育机关——师范学院。艺术与文化也获得了巨大的成就。
