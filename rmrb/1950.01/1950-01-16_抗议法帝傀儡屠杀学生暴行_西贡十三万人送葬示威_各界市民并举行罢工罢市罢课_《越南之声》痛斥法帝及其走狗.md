Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 15th: On January 12th, 130,000 Vietnamese people in Saigon held a funeral demonstration for a Vietnamese student who was shot and killed by French puppet police on the 9th. According to a Reuters report, this was the largest demonstration in Saigon since 1945. Stores and schools in Saigon stopped working, joining the funeral procession. Citizens from all walks of life in Saigon also protested this atrocity with strikes, market strikes, and class strikes.

The "Voice of Vietnam" radio station, in a commentary titled "Vietnamese Students Struggle Against French Colonialists and Their Lackeys," strongly condemned the Saigon French colonial authorities for their cruel behavior towards students. The broadcast said that 130,000 Vietnamese people in Saigon participated in the funeral ceremony on the 12th with indignation. In the silent procession, everyone's heart was burning with the anger to resolutely punish the imperialist aggressors and their lackeys. The commentary also ridiculed the recent "transfer of power" farce played by the French imperialists and their puppet Bảo Đại. The commentary pointed out that these deceptive tricks played by the French imperialists cannot deceive the world and the Vietnamese people. Ninety-five percent of Vietnam's territory is under the control of the government of the Republic of Vietnam, and the same proportion of the Vietnamese people support the government of the Republic of Vietnam under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh.

It is reported that on January 9th, French police and puppet police fired at unarmed Vietnamese students who were demanding the release of arrested classmates, killing one student and wounding twenty-two others. The "Saigon Vietnamese Democratic Youth League" has since published a booklet denouncing the barbaric and fascist behavior of the French police, calling on democrats in France and other countries to support the cause of the Vietnamese people in their struggle for democracy, freedom, and world peace.

    《越南之声》痛斥法帝及其走狗
    【新华社北京十五日电】一月十二日，西贡十三万越南人民为被法国傀儡警察于九日枪杀的一位越南学生举行送葬示威游行。据路透社消息称，这是自一九四五年以来西贡人民最大的一次示威游行，西贡商店和学校都停止了工作，参加送葬的行列。西贡各界市民并以罢工、罢市、罢课抗议这次暴行。
    《越南之声》广播电台在“越南学生为反对法殖民者及其走狗而斗争”的评论中，严斥西贡法国殖民当局对学生的残酷行为。广播说，西贡十三万越南人民以愤慨的心情，参加了十二日的送葬殡仪，在沉默中前进的送葬行列中，每个人的内心都燃烧着坚决惩办法帝国主义侵略者及其走狗的怒火。评论并嘲笑法帝国主义与其傀儡保大最近扮演的“移交政权”滑稽剧。评论指出，法帝国主义所玩弄的这些诡骗技俩，欺瞒不了世界与越南人民。越南百分之九十五的领土，都在越南共和国政府控制之下，同样比例的越南的人民都拥护胡志明主席领导下的越南共和国政府。
    按一月九日法国警察及傀儡警察曾向要求释放被捕同学的越南徒手学生开枪，结果打死学生一人，打伤学生二十二人。“西贡越南民主青年团”为此曾发行斥责法国警察野蛮与法西斯行为的小册子，呼吁法国及其他各国的民主人士，支持越南人民为争取民主、自由与世界和平而奋斗的事业。
