    A New Type of Primary School
    You Qiong
    After a year of transformation since liberation, Beijing Ninth District Central Primary School has become a new type of primary school in the capital. The school has a long history. Before the War of Resistance, its facilities were relatively complete. However, after the ravages of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the school buildings were dilapidated, and desks and chairs were incomplete before liberation. Most students stood or even squatted to listen to the lectures. They still drank cold water in winter, and there were no sports or music supplies at all. At that time, the principal, Liu Zhongqi, was a special agent of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army. He was corrupt and tried every means to exploit the students, forcing them to raise money to repair the houses, but he pocketed the donations. He also subjected the students to corporal punishment.
    In March last year, the Municipal Education Bureau sent Principal Han Li to take over the school. At that time, teachers and staff generally felt uneasy. They doubted the Communist Party, believing that the Communist Party and the People's Government would not be able to run the school well. They did not understand the government's policies, feared unemployment, and were perfunctory in their work. Many teachers were late for class, did not attend self-study, and slipped away before the students left after school. Some often complained and said strange things, and some teachers even threatened the principal, saying, "It was very common to beat the principal in this school in the past." Holding a passively resistant attitude, they did not actively work.
    In response to this situation, the school authorities believed that the focus of work must first be placed on transforming the ideology of teachers and staff. Through individual talks, the ideological situation of each person was understood from positive and side aspects; meetings were held to explain policies, and everyone was advised to stay at their posts to eliminate their ideological concerns. Political study was strengthened, democratic education was carried out, and teachers' democratic thinking and democratic style were cultivated, so that they could approach children, understand children, and be able to inspire and guide children. At the same time, practical problems of students were solved, such as digging toilets, repairing desks and chairs, boiling water, cooking mung bean soup, subscribing to newspapers, buying books, buying musical instruments and sports supplies, etc. During this stage, because the principal cared about everyone's life, worked hard, humbly adopted the opinions of the masses, and boldly admitted her shortcomings, her prestige was quickly enhanced, and everyone felt that the new principal was much better than the old one. Through factual education and political study, teachers and staff gradually became aware, their emotions stabilized, and they not only attended classes on time, watched students study on their own, but also began to work actively. Teacher Zhang Xiujun fainted during the last class in the morning for several days in a row, and still came to class in the afternoon. When she was advised to rest, she said, "I am afraid of delaying the students' classes. Finding someone to substitute will affect the students' learning." When the work was tight, most people did not sleep until midnight. They said, "The Communist Party has gone through the most difficult stage for the liberation of the people. Now that we have won, we have become aware. What does a little bit of hard work matter!" Some workers have also changed from passive slackers to actively seeking work. They used labor to commemorate the "May 1st" Labor Day and built a very good toilet, saving the public a lot of money. Now two workers have been approved to join the Communist Youth League. A student's parent said to Principal Han with great emotion, "We haven't boiled water for ten years. Since you came, you give students boiled water for free. That's really great!" The students also wrote poems on the wall newspaper to praise the principal, saying, "...Principal Han is so enthusiastic, turning raw water into mung bean soup." Students who used to hide when they saw the principal now ran up to her and bowed to her before leaving when they saw the principal coming from the opposite side.
    In terms of management, the school first announced the abolition of corporal punishment and implemented democratic management. Because the students did not understand the meaning of democracy, anarchy occurred at the beginning, and there were random fights. After the teachers and staff's emotions stabilized, the school authorities further proposed the slogan of "Good Student Movement" and began to rectify student order. The method was to have students make their own covenants and abide by them. The main content of the "Good Student Covenant" made by the students was: study hard, attend classes on time, cherish public property, and make more suggestions. At the same time, a Learning Order and Cleanliness Inspection Committee was established to commend good classes and promptly criticize bad ones, so that everyone had a deep impression of the "Good Student Movement"; then elections were held, and a total of 132 good students from the class, 40 good students from the whole school, and 6 progressive classes were elected.
    Through the "Good Student Movement," students and teachers have universally improved their ideological understanding. Students know how to consciously abide by the covenant, and have a preliminary understanding of democracy. Teachers also stepped up their studies, fearing being left behind by the students. From these points of view, the good student movement was successful. Some deviations arising from this movement, such as neglecting business research, holding too many meetings affecting students' homework, and political common sense and Chinese being good but arithmetic being poor, have gradually been overcome. After the learning order was restored, the school launched business research. Last November, a Chinese language demonstration teaching was held. Teachers with teaching experience from the Central Primary School used new teaching methods to demonstrate, and principals and Chinese language teachers from municipal and private primary schools in the whole district observed and then discussed and studied. Teachers felt that the old-fashioned teaching methods were not working. If they wanted to teach well, they had to prepare fully before class and collectively study the teaching materials; and have a comprehensive plan for teaching purposes, key points, teaching steps, teaching methods, and time allocation. They respectively established grade-level and subject-level groups, which played a great role in unifying teaching, exchanging experiences, and uniting and helping each other. Students also consciously knew how to study hard. Students with poor grades automatically asked their classmates for tutoring, and parents also played a supervisory role, and students' grades generally improved. Students are no longer afraid of exams, but feel that frequent exams are very beneficial.
    The school also carried out ideological education in coordination with various movements. For example, through the disaster relief movement, class friendship was promoted; during the celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China, students' understanding of the Communist Party and New China was strengthened; and in the International Day of Struggle for Peace and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Movement, internationalism education was carried out. The anti-communist and anti-Soviet ideas that elementary school students had been infected with during the reactionary education gradually disappeared. Now they applaud when they see Stalin in the movies, and they are exceptionally enthusiastic when signing their names to wish him a happy birthday. After the Young Pioneers team was established, more than 70% of the students in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades participated. They cooperated with the student union to promote work and played an active leading role. Some experience has also been gained in the transformation of naughty children. To transform these children, it is first necessary to understand their personality and the reasons for their naughtiness, and then use a sympathetic attitude to impress and persuade them, without hurting their self-esteem; at the same time, the principal and teachers must be consistent in their attitude when dealing with problems. For example, some students do not listen in class, take the lead in fighting after class, steal things, and forge soy milk tickets from the soy milk room. So the teachers, in conjunction with the parents, patiently persuaded them and took them to see educational movies. Under this proper education, they gradually realized their mistakes, resolved to correct their mistakes, joined the Children's Team, and listened attentively in class.
    In leading and organizing students' extracurricular activities, the school held gymnastics, music, and wall newspaper competitions. These frequent competitions, on the one hand, stabilized the students' order, and at the same time enriched the students' lives. The children organized their own band, led by a reformed twelve-year-old naughty child as the general director, and won praise when performing on the radio. In the wall newspaper, at first, the children mostly wrote things that they themselves did not understand, such as "The New Democratic Economy"... etc. Later, after the principal and teachers' enlightenment and guidance, various forms such as cartoons, clapper talks, riddles... etc. were used for education. The content of the wall newspaper became enriched, and the form became lively and vivid, arousing great interest among the children. Some students wrote their own scripts. After watching "The White-Haired Girl," they also put the scene of liquidating the crimes of the tyrannical landlord into their creations. Some drew portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu very well. The school used film to educate students, with great effect. After watching "Daughters of China," they said, "I must be a good member of the Children's Team now, and become a member of the Youth League and a Communist Party member in the future." In terms of children's welfare, the school established a cooperative and a soy milk room. They took the students to take baths.
    Now a new atmosphere has emerged in the school: the teaching is very planned and can complete tasks on schedule; the teachers and staff work very actively, and everyone has a teaching progress chart, and they can persist in studying for one and a half hours every day. More than a dozen teachers have been approved to join the Party and the League, and the principal and teachers are very united. Generally, students can concentrate in class and play to their heart's content after class, showing that they are very lively. In short, the Ninth District Central Primary School has become a new type of school. The main problems currently are insufficient funding and too few reading materials for students. For example, students like to read "Chinese Children," but the school does not have the strength to buy more of this publication, so many children cannot see it. The sports equipment is still very poor. There is not a single ping-pong table in the whole school, and everyone competes for a stone table after class.

    一个新型的小学
    有琼
    北京九区中心小学经过解放后一年来的改造，已成为首都一个新型小学。该校具有长久的历史。抗战前设备较完善，经过日寇和国民党反动派的统治摧残，在解放之前，校舍已破烂不堪，桌椅残缺，学生大都站着甚至蹲着听课。冬天仍喝凉水，其他如体育音乐用品则一概没有。当时的校长刘仲奇是蒋匪军统特务，贪污腐化，想尽方法剥削学生，强迫学生募捐修房子，却把捐款装进了自己的腰包。并对学生进行体罚。
    去年三月，市教育局派韩黎校长接管该校。当时教职员工友普遍存着不安情绪，他们怀疑共产党，认为共产党和人民政府办不好学校；对政府的政策不了解，怕失业，对工作敷衍。许多教员上课迟到，自习不到，放学时学生还没有走便先溜了，有的常发牢骚说怪话，有的教员甚至恐吓校长说：“这个学校过去打校长是很平常的事。”抱着消极抵抗的态度，不积极工作。
    针对这种情况，学校当局认为必须先把工作重点放在改造教职员思想上。通过个别谈话，从正面侧面去了解每个人的思想情况；开会解释政策，劝大家安于职守清除他们思想上的顾虑。加强政治学习，进行民主教育，培养教员的民主思想和民主作风，使他们能接近儿童，了解儿童，并能启发和指导儿童。同时，从实际上去解决学生切身的问题，如挖厕所、修桌椅、烧开水、煮绿豆汤、订报、买书、买乐器及体育用品等等。在这个阶段由于校长关心大家的生活，任劳任怨，虚心采纳群众的意见，大胆承认自己的缺点，她的威信很快的提高了，大家都觉得新校长比旧校长好的多。从事实的教育及政治的学习，教职员逐渐觉悟，情绪安定下来，不但准时上课，看着学生上自习，并且开始积极工作。教员张秀俊连着几天上午末一节课时都晕倒了，下午还来上课，劝她休息，她说：“怕误了学生的课，找人代课会影响学生的学习。”工作紧张时，大部分人都是半夜才睡。他们说：“共产党为了人民的解放把最艰难的阶段都过去了，现在胜利了，我们才觉悟，累一点算什么！”有些工友也由消极怠工变为主动找工作，他们用劳动来纪念“五一”节，修了一个很好的厕所，给公家省下很多钱。现在已有两位工友被批准加入青年团。一位学生家长很感动地对韩校长说：“十年来没有烧过开水，你来了，不要钱倒给学生烧开水，真好啊！”学生也在壁报上写诗来歌颂校长说：“……韩校长真热情，将生水变成绿豆汤。”从前看见校长就躲的学生，这时见校长从对面走来，也跑上去拉住她一鞠躬才走。
    管理方面，首先宣布废除体罚，实行民主管理。由于学生不了解民主的意义，开始时曾发生无政府状态，乱打架。在教职员的情绪稳定后，学校当局便进一步提出了“好学生运动”的口号，开始整顿学生秩序。方法是叫学生自己订公约自己遵守。学生订出的“好学生公约”主要内容是：努力学习，按时上课，爱护公物，多提意见。同时并成立学习秩序和清洁检查委员会，对好的班表扬，对不好的及时提出批评，使大家对“好学生运动”有了深刻的印象；然后便进行选举，共选出了一百三十二名班的好学生。四十名全校的好学生和六个进步班。
    通过“好学生运动”，学生教员在思想认识上都普遍提高了一步。学生知道自觉地遵守公约，对民主已有初步认识。教员也加紧学习，怕落在学生后面。由这些看来，好学生运动是成功了，从这个运动所产生的一些偏向如忽略业务研究，开会太多影响学生的功课，政治常识、国语好算术差等，也逐渐得到克服。学习秩序恢复以后，学校便展开了业务研究。去年十一月举办了国语示范教学，由中心小学有教学经验的教员用新的教学方法示教，组合全区市、私立小学的校长和国语教员观摩，然后讨论研究。教员感到老一套的教学方法是行不通了，要想教好，必须课前充分准备，集体研究教材；并对于教学目的、重点、教学步骤、教学方法、时间分配等都要有全盘的计划。他们分别成立了级任和科任小组，对统一教学、交流经验、团结互助起了很大的作用。学生也都自觉地知道用功，功课较差的自动请同学补习，家长也起了督促的作用，学生成绩普遍提高了。学生已不再怕考试，反而感到经常考试好处很大。
    学校并配合着各种运动，进行思想教育。如通过救灾运动，发扬阶级友爱；在庆祝中华人民共和国成立时，加强学生对共产党和新中国的认识；在国际和平斗争日和中苏友好运动中，进行国际主义教育。小学生们过去受反动教育时感染的反共反苏的思想逐渐消失了。现在从电影中看到斯大林便鼓掌，签名祝寿时，情绪异常热烈。少年儿童队成立后，四、五、六年级百分之七十以上的学生都参加了，他们配合学生会推动工作，并起了积极带头作用。在顽皮儿童改造方面也获得了一些经验。改造这些儿童首先要了解他的个性和造成顽皮的原因，然后用同情的态度去感动他说服他，不要伤他的自尊心；同时校长教师在处理问题时态度要一致。如有些学生上课不听讲，下课带头打架，偷东西，假造豆浆房的豆浆票，于是老师结合着家长，耐心说服，并带去看有教育意义的电影片。在这正当的教育下，他们渐渐觉悟了，决心改正错误，参加儿童队，上课也用心听讲了。
    学校在领导与组织学生课外活动方面，举行了体操、音乐和壁报等比赛。这些经常比赛，一方面稳定了学生的秩序，同时丰富了学生的生活。儿童们组织了自己的乐队，由一个已经改造的十二岁的顽皮儿童任总指挥，在广播电台演唱时，曾博得好评。在壁报中，起初，儿童多半写一些自己也不懂的东西，如“新民主主义的经济”……等，后来经过校长、教员的启发、指导，采取各种各样的形式如漫画、快板、谜语……等进行教育，壁报内容便充实了，形式也变得活泼生动，引起儿童极大兴趣。有的学生自己写剧本，他们看完《白毛女》后，也把清算恶霸地主罪恶的场面放进创作里。有的画毛主席朱总司令的像画得很像。学校利用电影教育学生，收效很大，在看了《中华女儿》以后，他们说：“我现在一定要作一个好的儿童队员，将来作青年团员、共产党员。”在儿童福利方面，学校成立了合作社、豆浆房。引学生去洗澡。
    现在学校里已呈现出一种新兴的气象：教导方面计划性很强，能按期完成任务；教职员工作非常积极，每个人都订有教学进步表，每天都能坚持一小时半的学习。已有十几位教员被批准入党入团，校长与教员团结得也很好。一般学生上课都能专心，下课则尽情地玩，表现得很活泼。总之，九区中心小学已变成一个新型学校了。目前存在的问题，主要是经费不足，学生们读物太少，例如学生喜欢看《中国儿童》，但学校却没有力量多买这种刊物，结果许多儿童都看不到。体育设备还很差，全校没有一张乒乓球台，下课后大家都争着用一张石桌子。
