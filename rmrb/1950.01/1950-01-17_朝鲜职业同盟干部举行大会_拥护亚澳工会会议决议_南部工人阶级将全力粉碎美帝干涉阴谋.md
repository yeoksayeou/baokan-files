Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th -- A conference of activists from the entire Korean Professional League, jointly hosted by the North Korean General Federation of Trade Unions and the National Council of South Korean Labor Unions, was held in Pyongyang on the 10th. Participants included Choi Kyung-duk, Chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean General Federation of Trade Unions, Choi Ho-min, Secretary-General, Park Se-young, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Council of Korean Labor Unions, and more than 1,200 professional league cadres and members from all over the country. First, Choi Kyung-duk reported on the various resolutions and achievements of the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference. In his report, he emphasized that the great achievements of the Soviet working class and the victorious experience of the Chinese working class struggle greatly encouraged the Asian working people's struggle against colonial plunderers. Subsequently, the conference held a heated discussion on Choi Kyung-duk's report, and finally unanimously adopted the resolutions of the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference and the decisions to be implemented specifically in Korea. The decision stated that the Korean working class is determined to arm itself with a high degree of proletarian internationalism under the banner of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The working class of North Korea will struggle to complete and exceed the Two-Year People's Economic Construction Plan. The working class in South Korea will struggle to expose and crush the conspiracy of US imperialism and its tool, the "United Nations Commission on Korea," to interfere in Korea's internal affairs, and to support armed struggle and overthrow the Syngman Rhee puppet government. The conference also passed congratulatory telegrams to Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the world's working class, and Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people.
