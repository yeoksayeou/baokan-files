    About the "Fifties"
    Song Yunbin
    On the first of this month, I published an article titled "The Fifties" in "People's Garden." A few days later, the editor of "People's Garden" sent me an article to read and asked me to respond. The article was titled "The Sixties," written by Mr. Jiang Jia Zhan. Mr. Jiang said, "This year is not the beginning of the nineteen fifties, but the beginning of the nineteen sixties." He put forward many reasons to prove that my statement, "This year is the beginning of the nineteen fifties," was wrong: (1) According to this statement, the years 1990 to 1999 should be the nineties of the twentieth century. Does each century only have ninety years? (2) If we calculate centuries in this way, then the years 1900 to 1999 should be called the nineteenth century. (3) Take a clock as an example. If the time is now five fifteen, and someone asks you, "Is it five o'clock now?" you would definitely answer, "No, it is five fifteen now." This means that five o'clock has passed, and this quarter of an hour belongs to the time frame of six o'clock. Therefore, the Russian expression is "a quarter of six," which means that a quarter of the four quarters of six o'clock has already begun. The principle is the same for centuries and decades. Finally, Mr. Jiang said: "This issue is originally very small, but if everyone misunderstands the decades, the problem becomes quite large. Therefore, I am specially explaining this principle clearly to remind everyone to pay attention, this year is the beginning of the nineteen sixties."
    To tell the truth, I am ashamed that I have never learned foreign languages well. For this question, I consulted many friends, and I am grateful for their guidance, which enabled me to answer Mr. Jiang's question.
    First of all, it should be explained that the so-called "decades" is a habitual way of speaking, not a mathematical problem. The Oxford Dictionary's entry for "fifties" reads: Years between fifty and sixty in a particular century or in one's life. Not only is this how decades are referred to in each century, but it is also the Western custom to refer to decades in a person's life in this way. "The Fifties" in English is "'fifties," which means "fifty-something." The "ies" indicates plurality, because there are several "fifty-somethings" going on from fifty, fifty-one, fifty-two... The so-called "fifty-something" means the years 1950-something, which is to say the nineteen fifties-something. Therefore, the "," or "." above "fifty" in English is a sign that "19" has been omitted. Sometimes in English, they refer to a certain decade of a century, and they use another word, "Decade," to indicate this. If we had always used "decades" in this sense, there would be nothing wrong with it in terms of the words themselves. However, it has never been used in this sense, and it has already become a fixed meaning of the Western "fifty-something" or "forty-something," "sixty-something," and so on. Since it has become "established by common usage," we do not need to object to it now.
    When I say "established by common usage," I mean that not only in English works is the decade of a century calculated in this way, but also in the works of Lenin and Stalin, the "decades" are often mentioned and calculated in this way (there are many examples, which will not be listed here one by one). Chairman Mao's works also often mention decades and calculate them in this way. I can give a few examples at random: "This is a decisive condition, which the Crimea Conference finally proved. This condition arose at the major turning point of world history – the nineteen forties." (On Coalition Government) The "forties" mentioned here refers to the years after 1940. "Sun Yat-sen and we have different worldviews, observe and deal with problems from different class standpoints, but in the nineteen twenties, on the issue of how to struggle against imperialism, we reached a fundamentally consistent conclusion." (On the People's Democratic Dictatorship) The "twenties" mentioned here refers to the years after 1920.
    After this explanation of this small question, I think Mr. Jiang Jia Zhan will surely be enlightened. I think it is very good that we can discuss issues so seriously, even though the issue is small. We pursue a question that we do not understand clearly to the end, and do not rest until we have thoroughly understood it, which is at least helpful to friends who "do not seek a thorough understanding when reading."

    关于“五十年代”
    宋云彬
    本月一日我在《人民园地》发表了一篇《五十年代》，过了几天，《人民园地》编者送一篇文章给我看，并且要我答复。文章的题目叫《六十年代》，是蒋家湛先生写的。蒋先生说“今年不是二十世纪五十年代的开头，而是二十世纪六十年代的开头”。他提出许多理由，证明我的“今年是二十世纪五十年代的开头”的说法是错误的：（一）照这样说法，一九九○年到一九九九年应该是二十世纪的九十年代，难道每一世纪只有九十年吗？（二）照这样说法来推算世纪，那么一九○○年到一九九九年应该说是十九世纪了。（三）举钟表为例，假如现在时间是五点一刻，有人问你“现在是五点钟吗”，你一定回答说“不，现在是五点一刻了”，意思就是说五点钟的时间已经过去，这一刻钟的时间属于六点钟的时间范围了，所以俄语的说法是“六点钟的一刻”，就是说六点钟的四刻时间已经开始一刻了。这道理和世纪年代的道理一样。最后蒋先生说：“这问题本来很小，假如大家都把年代弄错了，这问题可就不小。所以特别将这道理说个明白，提醒大家注意，今年是二十世纪六十年代的开头。”
    说起来真惭愧，我始终没有学好外国文，为了这个问题，请教过好多位朋友，承他们指教，使我能够向蒋先生解答这个问题。
    首先要说明的，所谓“几十年代”是一种习惯的说法，不是数学上的问题。牛津大字典（Oxford Dictionary）关于“五十年代”一条原文是这样的：Years between fifty and sixty in a particular century or in  one's life.不但每一世纪的年代是这样说法，人之一生在西洋习惯上也是这样说法的。《五十年代》英文作“'fifties”，就是“五十几”的意思，ies表示多数。因为五十、五十一、五十二……这样下去有若干“五十几”，所以是多数。所谓“五十几”，就是一九五几年的意思，也就是二十世纪五十几年的意思。所以英文fifty的上角有一“，”或一“．”，就是将“一九”省去的记号。英文中也有时说到某一世纪的第几个十年期，他们用另外一个字Decade来表明。我们如果一向就把“几十年代”当作这样的意义来用，就文字而论亦无不可。可是向来并没有当作这样的意义来用过，它已经确定成为西文“五十几年”或“四十几年”“六十几年”等等的意思了。既经“约定俗成”，我们现在也不必再有异议。
    我说“约定俗成”，就是说不但英文的著作里说到某世纪的几十年代是这样推算，列宁和斯大林的著作里常常说到“几十年代”，也是这样推算的（其例甚多，这里不一一列举）。毛主席的著作里也常常说到几十年代，也是这样推算的。我可以随便举几例：“这是一个决定的条件，克里米亚会议最后地证明了这一点。这个条件是在世界历史的重大转变关节——二十世纪四十年代产生的。”（论联合政府）这里所说的“四十年代”是指一九四○年以后的年份。“孙中山和我们具有各不相同的宇宙观，从不同的阶级立场出发去观察和处理问题，但在二十世纪二十年代，在怎样和帝国主义作斗争的问题上，却和我们达到了这样一个基本上一致的结论。”（论人民民主专政）这里所说的“二十年代”是指一九二○年以后的年份。
    这个小小问题，经过了这样解说，我想蒋家湛先生一定能够涣然冰释了，我觉得我们能够这样认真讨论问题是很好的，虽然问题很小。我们把一个不曾了解清楚的问题追究到底，非彻底了解不休，至少对于“读书不求甚解”的朋友是有帮助的。
