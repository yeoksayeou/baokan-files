    Bo'ai and Qi County Hold Training Classes
    to Train Old Midwives
    and Provide Scientific Delivery Education
    [This Newspaper's Report] When the Anti-Epidemic Treatment Team of the Health Bureau of the Pingyuan Provincial Government was working in Bo'ai County, it successively held two training classes for old midwives, each lasting about a week, and provided scientific education to sixty-six old midwives. The training method was to attend collective classes, using a conversational approach to explain scientific delivery methods and other knowledge. After class, they discussed their past delivery experiences and methods in groups. Staff members participated in the groups to encourage them to talk more and ask more questions. Their incorrect understandings of delivery and childbirth were recorded and explained in class. At the same time, visual teaching methods were used to show everyone from pictures how the fetus grows, the formation position of normal and difficult labor fetuses, how the fetus changes position during labor, and the process until birth. Models were also used to teach them various delivery actions. In addition, one day was spent explaining household hygiene and environmental hygiene. They observed flies and lice under a microscope, explained the harm of flies and lice, and combined this with education on delivery disinfection. After training, the old midwives had new understandings, but generally felt that the new delivery methods were troublesome and unwilling to use them. Therefore, after training, attention must be paid to checking their work.
    [This Newspaper's Report] The first class of the midwife training course held by the Qi County County Hospital in Shanxi Province ended at the beginning of last month. The students were all rural working women. After seven days of study, the trainees broke away from superstitious ideas and realized the benefits of new delivery methods. For example, in the past, it was said that if a woman did not have children, it was because the "Goddess of Mercy Who Sends Children" did not send them, but now they know it is because of physiological illness. They also realized that infant mortality is mostly due to unscientific delivery, not fate.
    [Another Dispatch] The masses in Boyu Village, Wenshui County, Shanxi Province, saw a report in the Shanxi Daily about Qi County's collective training of midwives and automatically introduced Su Jinlian, a midwife from their village, to the training class for study.

    博爱祁县举办训练班
    集训旧接产妇
    进行科学接产教育
    【本报讯】平原省府卫生局防疫治疗大队，在博爱县进行工作时，曾先后开办两期旧接产妇训练班，每期一周左右，向六十六名旧接产妇进行了科学教育。训练的方法是集体上课，用漫谈方式讲解科学接产方法等知识。下课后，分组漫谈各人过去接产的经验和办法。工作人员参加到小组里面，启发她们多谈，多提问题。并将她们对接产、生产的错误认识记下来，课堂上进行解释。同时利用图画教法，使大家从图画中看到胎儿怎样生长的，顺产和难产胎儿的形成位置，临产时胎儿如何变换位置，直到降生等过程。并利用模型，教给她们做各种接产的动作。此外，并曾以一天时间向大家讲解了家庭卫生与环境卫生。让她们观察了显微镜下的蝇子和虱子，说明蝇虱的害处，结合进行了接产消毒的教育。经过训练，旧产婆都有了新的认识，但一般感到新的接产方法麻烦，不愿用。因此，训练后，须注意检查她们的工作。
    【本报讯】山西祁县县立医院举办的接产妇训练班第一期于上月初结束，学员全是农村的劳动妇女。经七天学习，受训学员均打破迷信思想，认识到新接产方法的好处。比如过去说妇女如不生小孩是“送子观音”不送给，现在知道是因为生理上有病。也认识了婴儿死亡多因接产不科学，不是命里注定。
    【又讯】山西文水县伯鱼村群众，看到山西日报登载祁县集训助产妇的消息，自动介绍本村接产妇苏金莲到训练班学习。
