    Beijing Military Control Commission Recovers Foreign Barracks Land
    Beijing, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou Civilians and Soldiers Cheer in Unison
    "In the People's China, Imperialism is Not Allowed to Have the Slightest Privilege!"
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Beijing were very happy to hear the news that the Beijing Military Control Commission had recovered the foreign barracks land. To this end, the No. 1 and No. 3 Brigades of the Provost Marshal General Headquarters held a meeting of meritorious veterans on the 19th and 20th, and the commanders and fighters of other units also expressed their feelings. Comrade Jin Yong, political instructor of a certain company, said: "From the time the Eight-Nation Alliance attacked Beijing to before the liberation of Beijing, forty-eight years passed, and Chinese soldiers and police could not even touch the edge of the Dongjiaomin Lane." Comrade Jin is from Beijing and witnessed the atrocities of the imperialists when he was young. He recalled: "At that time, soldiers and patrolmen from the United States, France, and the Netherlands swaggered through Dongjiaomin Lane with bayonets and clubs. Some Chinese people were brutally beaten just for looking at them. The common people hated them very much and wanted to drive them away. But no one supported them. The government was a traitorous government, and the army was an anti-people army, so the arrogance of the imperialists became higher and higher. The common people could only endure this great shame, live in pain, and struggle cruelly, hoping for national independence." At this point, he excitedly said: "Since last year's first month, the sky has cleared. Our country has stood up. Now it is the people's world, the people's government, the people's Beijing, and the people's Dongjiaomin Lane. We can walk freely in Dongjiaomin Lane. This time, the Beijing Military Control Commission's recovery of the property rights of these countries' barracks is precisely the hope of the Chinese people for many years. As for our People's Liberation Army, I dare say that everyone likes it and everyone supports it." Cadres and fighters of the Provost Marshal General Headquarters, who frequently perform patrol duties in Dongjiaomin Lane, and of certain tank, artillery, and infantry units who are training hard and learning regularization, all said: "China has become the China of the Chinese people, and imperialism is fundamentally not allowed to have the slightest privilege here." Political worker Dong Shengyi said: "The Qing government and the Kuomintang government opposed the people, were corrupt and incompetent, and signed many traitorous treaties with imperialism, allowing foreign countries to have the right to station troops in China. Now that our country has stood up, we must of course safeguard national sovereignty and resolutely abolish these unequal treaties." (Tong Wen, Yun Xian, Mao Ting, Suo Fei, Huang Shan, Zhong Wen)

    京军管会收回外国兵营地产
    京唐张军民齐声欢呼
    “在人民的中国，不允许帝国主义有丝毫特权！”
    【本报讯】人民解放军驻京部队，听到北京市军管会收回外国兵营地产的消息后，非常高兴。纠察总队一、三大队为此于十九、二十日开功臣座谈会，其他各部指战员也纷纷发表感想。某连政治指导员金镛同志说：“从八国联军打北京到北京解放前，中间经过四十八年，中国的军队和警察，就不能摸摸东交民巷的边。”金同志是北京人，年小时便看过帝国主义者的暴行。他回忆道：“那时，美国、法国、荷兰的兵士、巡捕们，拿着刺刀和棒子，在东交民巷横行霸道。有的中国人仅仅因为看了他们一眼，便遭到他们可怕的毒打。老百姓都痛恨极了，想赶走他们。可是没有人给撑腰。政府是卖国的政府，军队是反人民的军队，这样，帝国主义的气焰就愈来愈高。老百姓只能忍着这种大耻辱，痛苦的生活，残酷的斗争，盼着国家的独立。”至此，他兴奋地说：“打去年正月起，天明了。我们国家站起来了。现在是人民的天下，人民的政府，人民的北京，人民的东交民巷，我们可以在东交民巷自由地走了。北京军管会这次收回这些国家的兵营地产权，正是中国人民的多年的希望。至于我们解放军，我敢说是个个喜欢，个个拥护。”经常活动在东交民巷执行纠察任务的纠察总队和正在紧张操练、学习正规化的某战车、炮兵、步兵等部队的干部战士都表示：“中国已变成中国人民的中国，根本不允许帝国主义在这儿有丝毫特权。”政工员董生溢说：“满清政府和国民党政府反对人民，腐败无能，和帝国主义订立了许多卖国条约，允许外国在中国有驻兵权，现在我们的国家站起来了，当然要维护国家主权，坚决废除这些不平等条约。”（同文、云先、茂庭、索扉、黄山、仲文）
