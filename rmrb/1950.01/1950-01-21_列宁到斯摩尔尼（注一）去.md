Lenin Goes to Smolny (Note 1)
By Shavelyev
On the evening of October 24th, Lenin sent a letter to the members of the Bolshevik Party Central Committee, which read:
    “If the government (Note 2) wavers, it must be overthrown at all costs.”
Just as Lenin was writing the letter, Stalin sent a liaison to Lenin’s secret residence.
The Central Committee telephoned and asked Lenin to come and stay at Smolny.
Vladimir Ilyich (Note 3) immediately disguised himself. He took a white wig from the table and put it on his head. He wrapped a large scarf around his face, as if suffering from toothache. He put on an overcoat and a greasy soft hat, the brim pulled down low, almost covering his eyes.

The liaison escorted Lenin to Smolny. He kept his pistol with him at all times. If anything unexpected happened on the way, he would have to use gunfire to attract the cadets (Note 4), so that Lenin could escape. He was ready to sacrifice his own life to save Lenin’s life.

They went out onto the street together and jumped onto a tram.

In order to find out how the news of the uprising was spreading, Vladimir Ilyich decided to talk to the female ticket seller.

“Where are we going?” Lenin asked.

“To the park,” the female ticket seller replied.

“Why are you going to the park so early?”

“Who are you?” the female ticket seller asked in return.

“I am a worker,” Lenin replied.

“Also a worker, are you!” the female ticket seller replied angrily, “Why go there? -- I don’t know what will happen. We are going to overthrow the bourgeoisie! That’s where we are going….”

The tram turned towards the park.

Lenin and the worker escorting him walked along the long Spalyernaya Street.

There, they suddenly encountered an unexpected misfortune: a mounted patrolman (Note 5) emerged from the street corner.

“Where are you going? Show your passes!” the patrolman shouted.

“Go ahead, Comrade Lenin,” the worker said in a low voice, “I will try to deal with them.”

Then the worker, as if drunk, staggered into the middle of the street and started arguing with the patrol.

At this moment, his hand was in his pocket, holding the pistol.

The patrolman kept staring at the drunken worker, the patrol leader waved his hand, and the patrol galloped away.

Lenin quickly entered Smolny.

Stalin reported to him on recent events and the decisions of the Central Committee.

Now, the central command of the uprising was in the hands of Lenin and his closest comrade-in-arms, Stalin.

    列宁到斯摩尔尼（注一）去
    沙威利叶夫作
    十月二十四日的晚上，列宁给布尔塞维克党中央委员会的委员们寄去一封信，上面写着：
    “政府（注二）要是动摇，无论如何要打倒它。”
    正在列宁写信的时候，斯大林派联络员到列宁的秘密住所。
    中央委员会打电话请列宁到斯摩尔尼去住。
    乌拉第米尔·依里奇（注三）马上化装，从桌上拿了白色的假发，把它戴在上头。脸上缠着一块大头巾，好像是患牙痛似的。穿上了大衣，戴上了油垢的软帽，帽边深深地掩盖在眼睛的上边。
    联络员护送着列宁到斯摩尔尼。在任何时候他都拿着自己的手枪。如果路上发生任何意外，他必须用射击来吸引士官生（注四），使列宁能够乘机逃走。他要牺牲自己的生命，来拯救列宁的生命。
    他们一起出到街上，跳上电车的机车去。
    为了打听起义消息传播的情形，乌拉第米尔·依里奇决定和女售票员谈话。
    “我们往那里去呢？”列宁问。
    “到公园去。”女售票员答。
    “为什么这样早就到公园去？”
    “你是什么人啊？”女售票员反问。
    “我是工人。”列宁答。
    “也是工人呢！”女售票员愤怒地回答：“为什么到那里去？——我也不知道会发生什么事情。我们将要打倒资产阶级！这就是我们要去……。”
    电车转向公园去。
    列宁和护送他的工人沿着漫长的斯巴列尔诺街走去。
    在那里突然碰到意外的不幸：从路角走出骑着马的巡察（注五）。
    “到那里去？拿出通行证来！”巡察长喊着。
    “到前面去吧，列宁同志。”工人低声说：“我要设法和他们周旋去。”
    于是工人好像酒醉似的，摇幌地走到街心，和巡察对骂起来了。
    在这时候，他的手放在藏着手枪的口袋里。
    巡察不住地盯着这喝醉了的工人，巡察长摇着手，巡察便向前奔驰去了。
    列宁很快地进入斯摩尔尼。
    斯大林向他报告最近事件和中央委员会的决定。
    现在起义的总枢纽都掌握在列宁和他最亲近战友斯大林的手中了。
