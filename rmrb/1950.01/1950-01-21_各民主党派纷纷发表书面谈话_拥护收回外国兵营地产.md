Various Democratic Parties Issue Written Statements
Endorsing the Recovery of Foreign Barracks Land

[This newspaper reported] Spokespersons from the China Democratic League, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party issued statements expressing enthusiastic support for the patriotic action of the Beijing Military Control Commission in recovering the land of the former U.S., French, and Dutch barracks in Dongjiaomin Lane, Beijing, and requisitioning the barracks and other buildings on the land for military needs.

China Democratic League: Guaranteeing the Integrity of China's Territorial Sovereignty, Revolutionary Diplomacy is Infinitely Exciting

The spokesperson for the China Democratic League issued a statement on January 20th, stating: For over a century, foreign imperialists have colluded with Chinese reactionaries to undermine China's sovereignty and oppress the Chinese people. Among these actions, the most egregious was the imperialists' construction of barracks and stationing of troops in China's capital based on the so-called "right to station troops" in the Boxer Protocol. This was tantamount to hanging a sharp blade over the heads of the Chinese people. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries constantly clamored about "abolishing unequal treaties." However, in reality, they fawned over the U.S. and did not dare to touch even a hair of the imperialists' privileges in China. This time, the Beijing Military Control Commission resolutely recovered these land rights and requisitioned the barracks, washing away the humiliation of unequal treaties of the past fifty years, which is truly infinitely exciting. This action by the government once again proves its ability to serve the people and resolutely implement revolutionary diplomacy, guaranteeing the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty.

China Association for Promoting Democracy: Fifty Years of Lost Territorial Sovereignty Has Truly Returned to the Embrace of the Motherland

The China Association for Promoting Democracy stated:

The Beijing Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has recovered the land of the former U.S., French, and Dutch barracks in the city and requisitioned the barracks and other buildings on the land for military needs. This is the Chinese People's Government resolutely implementing the Common Program adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, overturning decades of imperialist oppression of the Chinese people, and truly representing the interests of the Chinese people. We enthusiastically support such wise measures.

After the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded Beijing in 1900, various imperialist countries occupied land in Dongjiaomin Lane and other places in Beijing to build barracks based on the unequal Boxer Protocol. Although the U.S., Britain, France, and other countries declared the abolition of their privileges in China in 1943, the imperialist barracks infringing upon China's sovereignty still existed under the traitorous Kuomintang reactionary rule. Now that the People's Republic of China has been established and the people's own government has been established, we can truly take the initiative to abolish imperialist privileges in China. This means that the people have truly turned over and will never be oppressed by imperialists again. The Chinese land occupied by imperialists to station troops to oppress and humiliate the Chinese people for decades has been taken back today. This is something that excites and inspires the people of the whole country, and the people of the whole country will definitely enthusiastically support such wise measures.

At the same time, after receiving the order from the Beijing Military Control Commission to recover the barracks land and requisition the barracks and other buildings, the former U.S., French, and Dutch consuls attempted to delay and resist, citing unequal treaties signed with the Kuomintang reactionaries. However, because our Military Control Commission maintained a solemn stance and resolute attitude in safeguarding national sovereignty, they ultimately obeyed our Military Control Commission's order and handed over the barracks and land separately. In this way, the vestiges of the imperialists' "right to station troops" in China have been truly abolished, and fifty years of lost territorial sovereignty has truly returned to the embrace of the motherland.

Imperialist forces, get out of China forever!

Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party: Eradicating Imperialist Privileges and Resolutely Implementing the People's Will

Peng Zemin, Chairman of the Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, issued a statement stating: The Beijing Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's recovery of the land of the former U.S., French, and Dutch barracks in the city is the implementation of the policy stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This just measure is entirely based on the wishes of the Chinese people for half a century.

The "right to station troops" is the most vicious of the imperialist privileges of aggression against China. Recovering the land of the U.S., French, and Dutch barracks is to completely abolish the imperialists' right to station troops in China, that is, to uproot imperialist privileges in China. For decades, the facts have proven that only the people's government can so resolutely implement the people's own will.

This patriotic action by the Beijing Military Control Commission has been unanimously and enthusiastically supported by the people of all of China.

If the U.S. government did not consider itself an imperialist, it would not have the audacity to falsely accuse that "the Beijing Military Control Commission occupied the U.S. consulate." This trick of deceiving the world is precisely the imperialist trick of extortion and has long been understood by people all over the world. Especially shameful and ridiculous is that those fools in the U.S. State Department have brought out another set of their housekeeping skills, which is to follow up the extortion with a threat to the Chinese people—to withdraw all U.S. official personnel in China.

A word of warning to the U.S. imperialists and fools like Brad Edwards! According to a Chinese saying, you probably looked at the wrong "almanac," right? This kind of intimidation was quite effective against Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang government—in fact, they have always involuntarily listened to your dictates!—Now it is the People's Republic of China, and any threat to the people's government is equal to zero. The Chinese people are not afraid of any threats in order to protect their own interests and to defend their national sovereignty.

    各民主党派纷纷发表书面谈话
    拥护收回外国兵营地产
    【本报讯】北京市军事管制委员会收回京市东交民巷前美、法、荷兵营地产，并因军事需要征用各该地面上的兵营和其他建筑后，民主同盟、民主促进会和农工民主党发言人发表谈话，一致对这个执行人民意志的爱国行动表示热烈拥护。
    民主同盟：保证中国领土主权完整  革命外交令人无限兴奋
    中国民主同盟发言人一月二十日发表谈话称：外国帝国主义勾结中国的反动派，损害中国的主权，压迫中国的人民，已经有一百多年的历史；而其中，尤以帝国主义根据辛丑条约中的所谓“驻兵权”，公然在中国的首都建筑兵营驻兵，为最毒辣。因为这无异在中国人民头上悬垂着一枝利刃。过去国民党反动派，整天在叫嚣着“废除不平等条约”。但事实上，他们媚美事外，对帝国主义在中国的特权，从未敢触动其毫末。这次京市军管会毅然决然把这些土地权收回，并把兵营征用，一洗最近五十年来不平等条约之耻辱，实在令人感到无限兴奋。政府的这一次行动，正是再一次证明其能为人民服务，并坚决执行革命的外交，保证中国领土主权的完整。
    民主促进会：丧失五十年的领土主权真正回到了祖国的怀抱
    中国民主促进会声明称：
    中国人民解放军北京市军事管制委员会已收回了市内前美、法、荷兵营地产，并因军事需要征用各该地面上的兵营和其他建筑。这是中国人民政府坚决执行中国人民政协所通过的共同纲领，推翻了帝国主义几十年来对中国人民的压迫，真正代表了中国人民的利益，我们热烈拥护这样贤明的措施。
    一九○○年八国联军侵入北京后，各帝国主义国家即根据不平等的辛丑条约，在北京东交民巷等地先后占地建造兵营，一九四三年美、英、法等国虽然声明废除在华特权，但在卖国的国民党反动统治之下，帝国主义侵犯中国主权的兵营仍然存在。现在中华人民共和国成立了，人民自己的政府成立了，才能真正由我们主动的实现废除帝国主义在华特权。这就是说，人民真正是大翻身了，永远不受帝国主义者的压迫了，几十年来帝国主义为了驻兵压迫侮辱中国人民、而占去的中国地方，今天拿回来了。这是使全国人民欢欣鼓舞的事，全国人民一定热烈拥护这样贤明的措施的。
    同时另一方面，美、法、荷前领事接到北京军管会收回兵营地产并征用兵营及其他的建筑的命令后，还想借口与国民党反动派所订之不平等条约，曾企图拖延抗拒，但因我军管会维护国家主权之立场严正，态度坚决，终而服从我军管会命令，分别将兵营和地产交出。这样，真正废除了帝国主义在中国“驻兵权”的遗迹，使丧失了五十年的领土主权，真正回到了祖国的怀抱。
    帝国主义的势力，永远退出中国去！
    农工民主党：根除帝国主义特权  坚决执行人民意志
    中国农工民主党监委主席彭泽民发表谈话称：中国人民解放军北京市军事管制委员会收回市内前美、法、荷兵营地产，是执行中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领所规定的政策，这种正义的措施，是完全基于亘半世纪来的中国人民的愿望。
    “驻兵权”是帝国主义侵略中国的特权中最凶狠的一种，收回美法荷兵营地产，是彻底取消帝国主义在中国的驻兵权，亦就是将帝国主义在华特权连根拔除。几十年来，事实证明了，只有人民的政府才能这样坚决地执行了人民自己的意志。
    北京市军管会这一爱国行动，是获得了全中国人民一致热烈的拥护。
    假如美国政府不以帝国主义者自居，就不会厚颜无耻的诬赖说：“北京市军管会侵占美国领事馆”，这种欺骗世人的技俩，正是美帝国主义者讹诈的本领，其实也早为全世界的人们所洞知。尤其可耻而又可笑的，就是美国国务院里那些蠢才们，又搬出了另一套的看家本领，这就是接着讹诈后而对中国人民来一个威胁——要撤退所有在华的美国官方人员。
    敬告美帝国主义者和白德华之类的蠢才们！照中国俗话的说法，大概你们是看错了“通书”吧？对蒋匪的国民党政府，这种恫吓颇为有效，——其实他们一向是不由自主的听你们的颐指气使的啊！——现在是中华人民共和国，对人民的政府之任何威胁，是等于零。中国人民为着保护自己的利益，为着保卫自己国家的主权，是决不怕任何威胁的。
