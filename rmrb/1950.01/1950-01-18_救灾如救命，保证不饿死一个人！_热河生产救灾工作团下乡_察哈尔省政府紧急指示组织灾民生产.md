The Rehe Production Disaster Relief Work Group Goes to the Countryside
The Chahar Provincial Government Issues Urgent Instructions to Organize Disaster Victims for Production

[This newspaper dispatch] After the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government issued the production and disaster relief instruction of "No one is allowed to starve to death," the CCP Rehe Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Government, based on the province's past years of suffering from Chiang Kai-shek bandit disasters and natural disasters, the masses were extremely poor, last year's harvest was only 50%, and it is estimated that there are currently about 400,000 disaster victims who have no food and are living hand-to-mouth, the CCP Provincial Committee Secretary, members, and the Provincial People's Government Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and department heads personally led the production and disaster relief work group to Chengde and other twelve counties and banners (nine of which are more severely affected by disasters) to organize the masses for production and self-rescue in a planned manner. It is required that the average daily income of grain from sideline production for each male and female labor force in the province should be one jin, to complete the task of earning 100,000 tons of grain in the next three months to ensure victory over the disaster and to prepare for spring plowing, thereby realizing the goal of "having enough to eat and wear in three years, and living a prosperous life in five years" proposed last year. According to the current situation, the Chahar Provincial People's Government understands that there are about 200,000 disaster victims in the province, and in some places there is a serious threat of death from cold and starvation. Disaster relief work is urgent. The province issued an urgent instruction on the 10th of this month. The instruction first pointed out: "All cadres must be highly responsible for the disaster victims and make it clear that: disaster relief is like saving lives, and no one is allowed to starve to death. Resolutely oppose turning a blind eye to the disaster and being indifferent. But don't panic and lose confidence in production and self-rescue." The second item of the instruction pointed out: "Strengthen organizational leadership, first of all, improve the disaster relief committees at all levels, and special personnel should be drawn from the civil affairs, industry and commerce, supply and marketing cooperatives, banks and other departments to be responsible for mastering the disaster situation, organizing disaster victims for production, distributing relief, and other work." In the third item, "Organizing Disaster Victims to Produce and Overcome the Famine," the instruction proposed: "Adapt to local conditions, 'rely on the mountains to eat mountains, and rely on the water to eat water.' Achieve that everyone labors, and hands and feet are not idle." The second is to organize the masses to engage in sideline production, use work as relief, and provide relief, such as organizing spinning wool, cutting mountain goods, digging medicinal materials, weaving wicker products, burning sulfur, making and selling shoes, and twisting thread. Supply and marketing cooperatives and banks should give strong assistance. In terms of methods, emphasize organizing village by village, household by household, and specifically, and grasp the key points, solving one household is one household, and solving one village is one village. Under the conditions of need and possibility, such as opening canals and building roads, the masses in the disaster areas should be organized to participate in a planned manner, and the masses should be organized to help each other. All agencies, groups, and individuals should be called upon to practice thrift and provide relief to the masses in the disaster areas. Finally, it is pointed out that relief grain must be used to organize production, and when used, the production object must be found first, there must be a production plan, and then it will be issued. Giving to one household must have the effect of one household, and not be used as general relief.

    救灾如救命，保证不饿死一个人！
    热河生产救灾工作团下乡
    察哈尔省政府紧急指示组织灾民生产
    【本报讯】从中央人民政府内务部发出“不许饿死一个人”的生产救灾指示后，中共热河省委和省人民政府，即根据该省过去连年遭受蒋匪灾和天灾，群众异常贫困，去年年景仅收五成，以及估计目前没有吃粮与现挣现吃的灾民已达四十万人左右的情况，该省中共省委书记、委员及省人民政府正副主席、厅长等即亲自率领生产救灾工作团，于最近分赴承德等十二个县旗（其中有九个县、旗灾荒较重）有计划地组织群众生产自救。要求全省男女劳动力，平均每人每天从副业生产中进粮一斤，完成今后三个月挣粮十万吨的任务，以保证战胜灾荒，及做好春耕生产准备工作，从而实现去年提出的：“三年有吃有穿，五年丰衣足食”的奋斗目标。察哈尔省人民政府根据目前了解的情况，全省灾民约有二十万人，个别地方已有冻饿疾病交迫的严重威胁现象，救灾工作刻不容缓。该省特于本月十日发出紧急指示。该指示首先指出：“全体干部要对灾民高度负责，明确：救灾即救命，不许饿死一个人，坚决反对对灾情熟视无睹，漠不关心。但也不要惊慌失措，失掉生产自救的信心。”该指示第二项指出：“加强组织领导，首先要健全各级救灾委员会，由民政、工商、供销合作社、银行等部门抽调专人负责掌握灾情，组织灾民生产，发放救济等工作。”在第三项“组织灾民生产渡荒”中，该指示提出：“因地制宜，‘靠山吃山，靠水吃水’。作到人人劳动，手脚不闲。”其次是组织群众进行副业生产，以工代赈，救济等，如组织纺毛线、砍山货、刨药材、编荆货、烧硫磺、作卖鞋、捻线等，供销合作社、银行应给以大力帮助。在方法上强调逐村逐户，具体组织，并掌握重点，解决一户是一户，解决一村是一村。在需要与可能的条件下，如开渠、修路工程，应有计划地组织灾区群众参加，组织群众互助互济，号召各机关团体个人，厉行节约，救济灾区群众。最后指出发放救济粮，必须用以组织生产，动用时必须先找好生产对象，有生产计划，然后再行发给。发给一户要起一户作用，不作一般救济。
