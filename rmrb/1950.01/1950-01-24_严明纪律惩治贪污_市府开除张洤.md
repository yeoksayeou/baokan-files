    Enforce Discipline and Punish Corruption: Municipal Government Expels Zhang Quan
    [Beijing News] Zhang Quan, an employee of the Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, has not reformed his corrupt lifestyle from the old society and stole winter relief clothing. With the approval of the Municipal Government, he has been expelled. Zhang Quan is forty-six years old. In 1940, he served as a clerk in the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, and in 1946, he served as a secretary in the First Division of the puppet Military Council's Beiping Executive Headquarters. After the liberation of Beijing, he was educated at the Municipal Government Administrative Cadre School and then assigned to the Civil Affairs Section of the Municipal Government's Suburban Work Committee as an employee. After starting work, Zhang Quan never sought progress, was lax in his studies, and was passive and perfunctory in his work. On December 15th of last year, when distributing winter relief clothing in the suburbs, Zhang Quan stole a Western-style suit jacket and secretly exchanged a woolen sweater. After this incident occurred, the committee repeatedly spoke to him individually to educate him and held a general meeting of all cadres to help him recognize his mistakes. However, Zhang Quan not only did not repent but also blamed others for his mistakes, believing that his corruption was entirely due to the fact that the comrades present at the time did not resolutely stop him. In order to enforce discipline, the Municipal Government has expelled him and notified all affiliated units of this matter to educate all cadres.

    严明纪律惩治贪污  市府开除张洤
    【北京讯】北京市人民政府郊区工作委员会办事员张洤，不改旧社会腐化作风，盗取冬令救济衣物，业经呈奉市府批准，予以开除处分。张洤现年四十六岁，一九四○年曾在伪华北政务委员会充任科员，一九四六年在伪军事委员会北平行辕第一处任书记。北京解放后曾经市府行政干部学校教育后派至市府郊委会民政科充任办事员。张洤参加工作后，一向不求进步，学习松懈，工作消极散漫。去年十二月十五日发放郊区冬令救济衣物时，张洤竟窃取西服上衣一件，偷换毛衣一件。此事发生后，该会曾多次对其个别谈话，予以教育；并召开全体干部大会，帮助其认识错误。但张洤不仅不知悔改，反把错误推在别人身上，认为自己的贪污行为完全是由于当时在场的同志没有加以坚决制止的结果。市府为了严明纪律，遂予以开除处分；并将此事通报所属各单位，以教育全体干部。
