    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 5th: Today is the first official day of issuing the People's Victory Parity Unit Public Bonds. People across the country are enthusiastically subscribing. As of the time of this dispatch, according to incomplete statistics: total subscriptions in Shanghai have reached over 400,000 units; in Hangzhou, subscriptions from all workers and staff have exceeded 80,000 units; the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China and its affiliated departments sold a total of 12,103 units today; the Tianjin Branch also sold 12,955 units; and in Xi'an, 5,223 units have been sold. The number of pre-subscriptions by people from all walks of life in the above three cities that have not yet been purchased from the bank is not included in these totals.
    [Our Newspaper] On the first day of issuing the People's Victory Parity Unit Public Bonds, people from all walks of life in the capital enthusiastically purchased them. Throughout the day, people streamed to various departments of the People's Bank to make purchases. The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China and its affiliated departments sold a total of 12,103 units in one day. The Bank of China sold 34 units, and the Bank of Communications will begin selling them today. Collective purchases included 820 units by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, 3,500 units by the Central Youth League School, 3,000 units by North China University, 300 units by the General Affairs Department of the General Office of the Central People's Government, and 365 units by the Municipal Communist Youth League. Many citizens also purchased directly from the People's Bank. For example, citizen Wu Jin alone purchased 286 units, and foreigner Meng Yi (transliteration) purchased 102 units alone. Yesterday, factories, shops, organizations, and groups flocked to the People's Bank to obtain registration forms for purchasing public bonds.
    Due to a lack of clarity among various sectors regarding the specific purchase procedures, yesterday (the 5th), hundreds of inquiries were made to various sales units, either in person or by telephone. In response to this situation, the Savings Department and Cooperative Department of the bank dispatched external personnel to factories, schools, and industrial and commercial households to facilitate collective purchases and explain purchase procedures. It was also stipulated that various organizations, groups, schools, trade associations, and public and private enterprises could send representatives to directly contact the various departments of the bank to facilitate unified purchase and sales.
