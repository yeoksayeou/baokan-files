Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 7th. General Liu Bocheng delivered a speech at the Chongqing Municipal Celebration of Southwest Liberation on New Year's Day, outlining the tasks for the people of Southwest China this year. The full text is as follows:
Dear workers, farmers, students, intellectuals, figures in cultural and educational circles, figures in industrial and commercial circles, and all patriotic gentlemen:

Our campaign to liberate the Southwest has basically concluded victoriously on December 27th. What a joyful day for the masses of our long-oppressed people in the Southwest as we celebrate this great victory on this New Year's Day!

The liberation of the Southwest, under the overall situation of national victory, is the last major victory on the mainland, and also one of the major victories won by the People's Liberation Army after the founding of the People's Republic of China.

		Military aspect: To liberate Tibet, establish national defense, and eliminate hidden remnants of bandits.
This campaign to liberate the Southwest began on November 1st, with the successive recovery of vast areas such as western Hunan, western Hubei, Guizhou, eastern Sichuan, southern Sichuan, northern Sichuan, and southern Shaanxi. Many Kuomintang military generals, under our powerful offensive, successively revolted. People's Liberation Army units entering Yunnan have also reached Zhanyi, and in coordination with General Lu Han, repelled the attacking Chiang bandit Eighth Army and Twenty-sixth Army from Kunming. Finally, around Chengdu in western Sichuan, our First Field Army, Fourth Field Army, and Second Field Army units coordinated their operations and eliminated the backbone forces of the Kuomintang army under Hu Zongnan and other units, totaling more than 200,000 including those who revolted. Hu Zongnan himself fled to Taiwan. Chiang Kai-shek and the American imperialist Nolan's conspiracy, plotted in Chongqing to make a final struggle on the mainland, has been completely shattered by the great victory of our army. Now, the remaining bandits in the entire Southwest are only a few thousand under He Guoguang in Xichang, and the Eighth and Twenty-sixth Armies of two or three thousand people in Yunnan; if they are still not aware and do not quickly turn to the people's side, they will soon be completely wiped out. The remaining military tasks now are to liberate the Tibetan compatriots, establish national defense, and eliminate scattered and hidden remnants of the enemy.

In the one month and twenty-seven days from November 1st to December 27th, thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the support of the East China, Central South, North China, and Northwest strategic zones, the joint operations of the fraternal units of the First and Fourth Field Armies with the Second Field Army, the heroic and skillful fighting of our entire army's commanders and fighters, their overcoming of difficulties, and the completion of their tasks; and the active support and endorsement of the people from all walks of life in the Southwest, we were able to achieve such a great victory in such a short period.

		Three main tasks
Now, the people of Southwest China have achieved a great military victory, and everyone has become their own master. From now on, we will build a new Southwest region of the people based on the Common Program adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The main tasks facing us now are the following three:

		The first is: to establish a revolutionary order and maintain social order.
The Southwest region is the last liberated area in the country, and also the place where the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang entrenched itself for the longest time and where it finally collapsed on the mainland. Therefore, the issue of social order is more complex and many social problems urgently need to be resolved. These problems all need to be handled carefully and in a planned way. The most pressing issue at present is to deal with the special agents and bandits who are scattered, hidden, and continue to spread rumors and sabotage, and the armed forces of local bandits and special agents who are roaming in the countryside; everyone must be vigilant and thoroughly eliminate the local bandits and special agents. Dispersed soldiers and vagrants must be registered, concentrated for training, and properly handled. Only in this way can the social order in cities and rural areas be stabilized, and the people can properly produce and manage various industrial, agricultural, and commercial enterprises. This is the first key problem to be solved after liberation.

		The second is: to restore and develop production.
This is a basic issue in the Common Program, and it is also a basic issue for transforming our country from an agricultural country into an industrial country, and establishing a new democratic society. The Southwest region has been ruled by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang for the longest time, and its economy has been most deeply devastated. Before liberation, it was a base for Chiang's bandits to rely on for waging a war of national betrayal, and it suffered the deepest war disasters. When they were about to be defeated, the bandits systematically carried out frantic destruction. Therefore, there are many difficulties in restoring and developing production at present, and the first issue is how to restore production in a step-by-step manner. We must earnestly implement Chairman Mao's policy of "giving consideration to both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, helping each other between urban and rural areas, and exchanging domestic and foreign goods" in order to achieve the goal of developing production and prospering the economy. This is the central task that all work revolves around. Our people must adopt the attitude of masters of the country, be realistic, and advance steadily in order to heal the current wounds, overcome temporary difficulties, and pave the way for building a new Southwest region.

		The third is: to carry out cultural and educational work.
Chairman Mao said: Production construction (i.e., material construction) and cultural education (i.e., ideological construction) are two wheels that go hand in hand, and neither is dispensable. At the same time, cultural education mainly serves production construction, and it is carried out with production as the center. Chongqing is a place where the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's headquarters entrenched itself for a long time. It used to run various training classes on a large scale, print reactionary newspapers and books, conduct counter-revolutionary propaganda, instill feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas, deceive and poison young intellectuals and the people, while also destroying progressive culture, closing progressive schools and cultural institutions, and slaughtering progressive cultural and educational workers and young students, making it difficult to import progressive ideas. We must now develop a scientific, national, and mass culture, and resolutely eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas; the new cultural education serves the people. Improving the cultural level of the masses of the people will inevitably play a greater role in promoting production construction and other construction.

To achieve these tasks, we still need to work hard and overcome many current difficulties. For example, urban and rural manpower, materials, and financial resources have all been destroyed and damaged in large quantities by the enemy, the imperialist blockade, the existence of a large number of unemployed people in urban and rural areas, a large number of old civil servants urgently awaiting resettlement, a large number of scattered soldiers and vagrants urgently awaiting shelter, the activities of special agents and bandits urgently awaiting elimination, and the need to transform the economic structure previously ruled by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism into a new democratic economic structure, and to transform the wartime economic structure into a peaceful construction period economic structure, etc., all have many difficulties; we must face these difficulties squarely, clearly recognize the difficulties, and have the courage to overcome all difficulties. It should be noted that our current difficulties are difficulties in victory. Our Southwest region has 70 million people, abundant resources and products, the assistance of the people's governments of neighboring regions, especially the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the heroic and skilled People's Liberation Army, the people's democratic united front led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance; and the friendly assistance of the great socialist country of the Soviet Union, all difficulties can be completely overcome.

The construction of a brand-new, people's new Southwest region lies before us. As we welcome the New Year of 1950, the masses of the people must unite closely and work together to undertake this construction cause.

    重庆庆祝西南解放大会上
    刘伯承将军发表讲演
    提出西南人民今年建设任务
    【新华社重庆七日电】刘伯承将军元旦日在重庆市庆祝西南解放大会上发表讲演，提出西南人民今年任务。全文如下：亲爱的工人、农民、学生、知识分子、文化教育界、工商业界及一切爱国的先生们：
    我们解放西南的战役，已经在十二月二十七日基本上胜利地结束了。我们在今天新年的元旦日来庆祝这个伟大的胜利，在我们久受压迫的西南人民大众来说，是何等高兴的一天！
    西南的解放，是在全国总胜利的局面下，在大陆上最后的一次大胜仗，也是在中华人民共和国成立之后，人民解放军所获得的几次大胜仗中的一次大胜仗。
            军事方面：要解放西藏，建立国防，肃清隐蔽残匪。
    这次解放西南的战役，从十一月一日开始，首先陆续收复湘西·鄂西、贵州、川东、川南、川北、陕南等广大地区。许多国民党军将领，在我强大攻势之下，相继起义，进入云南的人民解放军部队也已到达沾益，协同卢汉将军打退了进攻昆明的蒋匪第八军和二十六军。最后在川西成都周围，我第一野战军、第四野战军和第二野战军部队协同作战，消灭了国民党军胡宗南基干军队及其他部队，如连同起义的兵力计算则共达二十余万人，胡宗南只身逃到台湾去了。蒋介石和美帝国主义者诺兰，在重庆商量定的在大陆上作最后挣扎的一套阴谋，已被我军的伟大胜利所完全粉碎。现在整个西南剩下的残匪，只有贺国光在西昌的几千人，和在云南的第八军与二十六军两三万人；如果他们还不觉悟，还不迅速转到人民方面来，很快就要被完全消灭掉。今后军事方面剩下来的事，就是解放西藏同胞，建立国防，和肃清分散的、隐藏的残余敌人了。
    从十一月一日到十二月二十七日的一个月零二十七天中，由于毛主席、朱总司令的英明领导，由于华东、中南、华北、西北战略区的支援，由于第一野战军、第四野战军兄弟部队与第二野战军并肩作战，由于我全军指战员的英勇善战，猛打猛进，克服困难，完成任务；由于西南各界人民积极支援与拥护，我们才能够在短短的期间，获得这样伟大的胜利。
            三个主要任务
    现在，西南人民在军事上已经获得伟大的胜利了，大家都作了主人翁，今后我们就要根据人民政协所通过的共同纲领，建设人民的新西南区。今后摆在我们面前主要的任务，就是下面所说的三个：
            第一个是：建立革命的秩序，维护治安。
    西南区是全国最后解放的地区，也是蒋介石匪帮盘据得最久和他在大陆上最后覆灭的地方，因此，治安问题，更加复杂，急待解决的社会问题也很多。这些问题都需要有计划地慎重地处理。目前首先就是对付分散隐蔽继续造谣破坏的特务匪徒，和流窜在农村的土匪特务武装的问题；必须人人一致警觉起来，彻底肃清土匪特务，对散兵游勇，必须进行登记，集中训练，妥善处理。只有这样，城市与农村的社会秩序才能安定下来，人民才能各自好好生产，经营工农商各业。这是解放后第一个要解决的关键问题。
            第二个是：恢复和发展生产。
    这是共同纲领中的基本问题，也是使我们国家由农业国变成工业国，建立新民主主义社会的基本问题。西南区受蒋介石匪帮统治最久，经济遭受摧残最深，解放以前为蒋匪依靠作卖国内战的基地，所受兵灾也最深，临败走时该匪又有计划地进行了疯狂的破坏。因此，目前恢复和发展生产，困难很多，而首先是如何有步骤地恢复生产的问题。我们必须切实执行毛主席的“公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流”的四面八方政策，以达到发展生产，繁荣经济的目的，这是一切工作所围绕的中心工作。我们人民大众，一定要拿出国家主人翁的态度，实事求是，稳步前进，才能医治目前的创伤，渡过暂时的困难，铺平建设新西南区的道路。
            第三个是：开展文化教育工作。
    毛主席说过：生产建设（即物质建设）与文化教育（即思想建设），是相辅并行的两个车轮，缺一不可。同时，文化教育更主要地是为生产建设而服务，是以生产为中心来进行的。重庆是蒋介石匪帮首脑机关长期盘据的地方，曾经大规模地开办各种训练班，印发反动的报纸书籍，进行反革命的宣传，灌输封建的买办的法西斯主义的思想，蒙蔽毒害青年知识分子和人民，同时摧残进步文化，封闭进步的学校和文化机关，屠杀进步的文化教育工作者和青年学生，使进步的思想输入困难。我们现在必须发展科学的、民族的、大众的文化，坚决肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想；新的文化教育是为人民服务的。人民大众文化水准的提高，对于生产建设及其他建设必然要起更大的推进作用。
    要实现这些任务，还须要我们努力奋斗，克服当前的许多困难，例如城乡人力、物力、财力，都大量地被敌人摧毁破坏，帝国主义者的封锁，大批城乡失业者的存在，大批的旧公务人员急待安置，众多的散兵游勇急待收容，特务土匪的活动急待肃清，以及要把以前帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义统治的经济结构，改变为新民主主义的经济结构，要把战时的经济结构，改变为和平建设时期的经济结构等等，都有许多困难；我们必须正视这些困难，清醒地认识困难，并有勇气战胜一切困难。须知我们目前的困难，是胜利中的困难。我们西南区有七千万人民，有丰富的资源和物产，有邻近各区域人民政府的援助，特别是有中共中央，中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导，有英勇善战的人民解放军，有工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主统一战线；有伟大社会主义国家苏联的友谊援助，一切困难，完全可以克服。
    一个崭新的、人民的新西南区的建设伟业，就摆在我们的前面，我们在迎接一九五零年的新年时，人民大众必须紧紧地团结起来，一齐努力，来担任这一建设伟业。
