    Production Units Under the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry
    Reduce Costs and Increase Efficiency
    Many Production Tools Have Been Improved
    [Report from this newspaper] After ten months of active restoration, the production quantity and quality of various production units under the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry have exceeded pre-liberation levels. Costs are gradually decreasing, and work efficiency is gradually increasing. When the tram company was taken over, it had only forty-eight trams. In April, the movement to reach one hundred trams was completed. After the fire (fifty-eight trams were burned), the workers continued their efforts and restored one hundred trams by November. In the course of the movement, they overcame many difficulties, created fire-resistant glass rings and large gate boxes, and solved the difficulties in tram repair. After implementing the route responsibility system, even more significant results were achieved. In the past, the breakdown rate was 22%, but in November it was reduced to 12%, and now it has been further reduced to 10%. Sometimes, not a single tram breaks down in a day. Although the company owes the bank 1 million catties of rice, it has produced twenty-eight new trams, and the overall calculation shows that it is not losing money. Currently, eighty-eight trams are running daily, carrying 110,000 passengers. When the bus company was taken over, it had only five buses, twenty-two staff members, and seventeen workers; now, more than fifty buses have been repaired. With the addition of buses from Nanjing, three routes have been opened, with more than thirty buses running. The number of employees has increased from the original thirty-nine to two hundred and thirty-seven (the two hundred and forty-nine people transferred from Nanjing are not included). The water company has added 615 new users this year, and the price has been reduced by half (at the time of the takeover, it was two catties of rice per ton of water, now it is one catty of rice per ton of water). There has also been progress in saving electricity: in the past, each ton of water required 0.606 kilowatt-hours of electricity, now it requires 0.408 kilowatt-hours, a reduction of 17.8%. Water leakage has decreased from 37.5% to 31.7%. Not only has the water price been reduced, but the clear water pond has also been cleaned, improving the water quality. The Qinghe Woolen Mill has entered regular production after the machines were reorganized. All three stages of production (from wool to yarn - yarn to cloth - cloth to finished product) have timekeeping, labor recording, and material recording systems. Cost accounting has been established (but it is not yet detailed enough), and a bonus system for exceeding quotas has been implemented. 100% of cotton textiles meet the standards, and wages have been increased by 6%. The Yanjing Paper Mill has achieved even more significant results in reducing costs and improving quality (this newspaper has already reported on it). The glass factory was built from a pile of broken tiles: at the beginning of operation, there was only one furnace, producing 900 catties per day; now, it has increased to two furnaces, producing 1,500 catties per day. In addition to restoring the supply of ice for the citizens, the ice-making factory has also restored the cold storage of more than 100 tons, which can increase the price of vegetables, which is also beneficial to farmers. The brick kiln makes the most profit from a proportional perspective: it produces 170,000 bricks per day (excluding Beijing Kiln), and everyone is rushing to buy them. The lime kiln only started firing in December, and now it produces 40 to 70 tons per day. In the production process, many examples of labor models have emerged, such as water meter repair workers who used to repair three meters per day, but now average more than six. In completing the Shuangqiao trunk line, the workers transformed the lead melting furnace, saving 75% to 80% of fuel. In the tram company, one electric roller used to require ninety work hours, but now it only requires forty. In the past, making a gear wheel required four man-hours per month, but now it only requires half. The Qinghe Woolen Mill has converted hand-cranked machines into automatic ones. There are also many model deeds in the Jingxi Coal Mine and the glass factory.

    京市工业局所属生产单位
    成本减低效率提高
    不少生产工具已有改进
    【本报讯】京市工业局所属各生产单位，经过十个月的积极恢复，生产的数量与质量都已超过解放以前。成本逐步减低，工作效率逐步提高。电车公司接管时只四十八辆车，四月份完成了百辆车运动，失火后（被烧五十八辆）工人继续努力，到十一月份又恢复了一百辆，并在运动中间克服了许多困难，创造了火玻璃圈及大闸盒，解决了修车中的困难。在实行车路负责制以后，更获得显著成绩。过去坏车率占百分之二十二，十一月份减到百分之十二，现又减到百分之十。有时一天不坏一辆。虽然欠下银行一百万斤米，但出了二十八辆新车，总的计算并不赔钱。现在每天出车八十八辆，乘客十一万人。汽车公司接管时只有五辆车，二十二个职员，十七个工人；现在修理好的车已有五十多辆。加上南京来的车，已开辟了三条路线，出三十多部车。职工由原来之三十九人增至二百三十七人（由南京拨来二百四十九人未列入）。自来水公司今年增加用水户六百十五户，价格减低了一半（接管时二斤米一吨水，现在一斤米一吨水）。节电也有成绩：过去每吨水用电○、六○六度，现在○、四○八度，减少百分之十七·八。漏水过去百分之三十七·五，现在百分之三十一·七。不但减低了水价，并且清洗了清水池，提高了水的质量。清河制呢厂机器整理后，已走入正规化生产。生产的三个段落（从毛到纱——纱到布——布到成品）都有记时记工记料制度。成本计算已打下基础（但还不够细密），并实行了超额奖励制，棉织品达到百分之百合乎标准，增加工资百分之六。燕京造纸厂在减低成本与提高质量上，成绩更为显著（本报已有报导）。玻璃厂是从破瓦堆中建立起来的：开工之初只有一盘炉，日产九百斤；现在增加到二盘炉，日产一千五百斤。制冰厂除了恢复保证市民用冰外，并恢复了冷藏一百多吨，可以使小菜价格提高，对农民也有好处。砖窑从比例数字上看，赚钱最多：每天出十七万砖（北京窑不在内），各方面都抢着买。石灰窑十二月份才开始生火，现日出四十至七十吨。在生产过程中，出现了许多劳动模范例子，如自来水修表工人过去每天修三个，现在平均六个以上。在完成双桥干管中，工人改造了化铅炉，省燃料百分之七十五至八十。电车公司一个电滚子过去用九十个工，现在只用四十个。过去做牙轮每月须用四个人工，现在只用半个。清河制呢厂已将手摇车改成自动的。其他京西煤矿、玻璃厂也有好多模范事迹。
