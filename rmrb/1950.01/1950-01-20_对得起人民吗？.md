    Are You Worthy of the People?
    Wu Wei
    Some comrades complain about the subjective and bureaucratic ways of leading comrades, and their unwillingness to accept advice. Therefore, they vow to never offer suggestions again, saying they'll do whatever the leadership tells them to do, and if the work doesn't go well, it's the leaders' responsibility. "Anyway, I work hard and am worthy of the people."
    Is this being worthy of the people? When you discover problems with the leadership but fail to actively and sincerely offer your opinion, and the work suffers as a result, can you really say you are worthy of the people?
    In reality, this is letting the people down, a concrete manifestation of a weak sense of responsibility to the people's cause. When your opinions are not accepted by the leadership, instead of humbly examining whether your opinions are correct, you simply feel rebuffed, hurt your pride, and are unwilling to offer suggestions again. Isn't this liberalism and a lack of responsibility to the people's cause?
    A comrade who is truly worthy of the people is one who constantly and actively studies the work or instructions assigned by the leadership in light of specific circumstances. If they find shortcomings, they honestly and actively offer sincere suggestions from the standpoint of being responsible to the people. Even if their opinions are not accepted by the leadership, they must adhere to the principle of "insisting in principle, obeying organizationally," actively do the work, and then review the situation later.

    对得起人民吗？
    吴为
    有些同志埋怨领导同志的主观主义、官僚主义，不接受意见。因此便发誓以后不再提意见，领导叫我做啥我就做啥，工作搞不好由领导人负责任。我反正工作积极，对得起人民就是。
    这样，对得起人民吗？当你发现领导有毛病时，不积极诚恳的提出意见，而让工作受到损失，你能说你对得起人民吗？
    实际上这就是对不起人民，这是对人民事业责任心薄弱的具体表现。当自己的意见领导上不接受时，不能虚心的检查自己的意见对不对，如果对的便坚持下去；而认为碰了钉子，伤了自尊心，不愿再提意见，这不是对人民事业不负责的自由主义是什么？
    真正对得起人民的同志，是经常积极的按照具体情况来研究领导布置的工作或指示。假使发现有不周到的地方，就老老实实的站在对人民负责的立场上积极诚恳的提出；如果意见不为领导上所接受，也一定掌握住“原则上坚持，组织上服从”的原则，积极做了工作，然后再来检讨。
