Workers' Lives Cannot Be Trifled With!
    The Da Maosheng Coal Mine Crushing Death Case:
    Principal Culprit Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal People's Court sentenced the Da Maosheng private coal mine in Mentougou on the 6th of this month for illegally and privately consuming recovered coal, collapsing the main roof and causing a worker's death. The Jingxi Mining Bureau, in order to ensure the safety of workers' lives in the Jingxi mining area, had repeatedly issued notices, ordering all kilns to pay attention to the safety of underground engineering, strictly prohibiting the failure to pump accumulated water, failure to leave coal pillars, and destructive mining, and convened a meeting of kiln managers on September 30, solemnly announcing this matter. However, Lei Jinfa, the manager of the private Da Maosheng kiln, and Xu Desheng, the deputy manager, neither attended the meeting in person nor sent anyone to attend, turned a deaf ear to the government's notices, did not value the safety of workers' lives, and did not adopt the opinions of the trade union. As a result, on October 19 last year, they eventually consumed recovered coal and collapsed the main roof, crushing to death workers Li Dehai, Han Guangcun, Lü Xiaosan, Chen Yu'an, Chen Gang'er and five others, and injuring workers Yue Dashun, Gao Yucun, Zhao Wanming, and Duan Huaizeng. The government of the 20th district of this city, the Jingxi Mining Bureau, the Mentougou Small Mine Trade Union, and 80 workers including Zhang Wenshan jointly filed a complaint with the Beijing Municipal People's Court resident in Mentougou on November 12. After accepting the case, the court conducted more than a month of investigation and interrogation, and rendered a judgment on January 6. In order to safeguard the safety of workers' lives and severely punish such sinful acts of deliberately violating government decrees and disregarding human lives, the government sentenced Lei Jinfa to ten years in prison, Xu Desheng to eight years in prison, and Li Rong to six years in prison.
