Review of "New Quyi Series"
		Wang Chun

    The "New Quyi Series," jointly compiled by the Popular Literature and Art Creation Research Association and two other units, and published by Xinhua Bookstore, has already released six collections and is said to be releasing more. The six published books include thirty-eight ballads. The themes cover all aspects: writing about battles, writing about production, anti-feudalism, anti-superstition, and so on. The very popular "Examining the Witch" and "Great Production" are included in it. In general, this is a good set of books.
    The "front" occupied by "feudal culture" is indeed very broad; telling a story will let everyone know. A comrade who used to work with us at the North China Xinhua Bookstore used to work in a bookstore that specialized in publishing old novels, ballads, "Bai Zhong Jing," "Yu Xia Ji," and other things before the War of Resistance Against Japan. He said that his boss once told the shop assistants that the business had a great future. The boss said: Over the years, there have been many movements of new culture and new literature, but I don't think they will work. When their books are printed, each type is only one or two thousand copies, but when I print "The Golden Bracelet Jade Ring Story," "Yuan Hai Zi Ping," etc., it is always two or three hundred thousand copies. From this point of view, the world is still mine! These words may be a bit boastful, but such facts cannot be ignored. Today, the feudal class has fallen, and feudal culture has lost the support of emperors and ministers, which seems like it should not work, but it is not that easy. Although they themselves do not have an organization for reactionary propaganda, nor do they have feudalists leading them, they still have great power and occupy a large market with a large population. There are two reasons why they can exist: one is that after thousands of years of feudal education, the masses have actually regarded this hateful culture as their own, so Chairman Mao said: "Opposing this enemy in the minds of the masses is even more difficult than opposing Japanese imperialism!" One is that some of us have always only paid attention to advanced creations and so on, and have adopted an attitude of contempt towards them. He has a mass base, and the world was originally his; we don't compete with him, don't seize his position, and mind our own business, how can he not sit firmly on his throne?
    Recently, our situation is a bit different. We have organizations in this regard, and we have leadership and plans, and we are doing it as a major event. They are also a little uneasy. It is said that the publishers in Damo Factory also feel that the old things are not welcomed by the masses, and hope that we can give them some new things to print. The "New Quyi Series" and other such works are timely good books that replace feudal culture.
    These six works are selected and edited, and they are all relatively good works. For example, "Women Transporting Grain" (by Tao Dun), which describes the enthusiasm of Shandong women in supporting the front line, "Aunt Li Watching the Conference" (by Wang Mingfu), which describes the joy of the people of Tangshan in celebrating the People's Political Consultative Conference, "Sister-in-law Ye Pushing a Boat Across the River" (by Miao Peishi and Cao Zige), which describes the people of Jiangbei bravely helping the People's Liberation Army cross the river, and "Zhao Xiangde Makes Havoc on the Zhengtai Road" (by Miao Peishi), which tells the story of a hero who killed the enemy, are many truly representative works of the people's revolutionary strength, which can squeeze out "Five Women Revitalizing the Tang Dynasty" and the like from the position. Another very good one is Zhao Shuli's rewritten "Examining the Witch." This work is nominally made by four or five farmers in Beitou Village, Pingshun County, but it is almost equivalent to Zhao Shuli's work. At that time, we were still in the Taihang Mountains. We received this very original submission, and Zhao Shuli rewrote it word by word, making it the very beautiful work it is now. Its advantage is that there is not a single rhyming sentence, not a single useless word, it is natural and easy to read, and there is no affectation.
    Speaking of this, we have to talk about some of the shortcomings of these works. First of all, ideologically, it is sometimes inevitable to introduce feudal consciousness. For example, "Women Transporting Grain" narrates that Futai Village in Zhucheng, Shandong Province, needed to urgently transport public grain to the front line, but unfortunately there were not enough men in the village, so the women volunteered to drive donkeys to deliver it. An Aunt Liu managed to win a place in the village meeting to go on a business trip, and she was so happy that she went home to prepare to leave, but her two daughters-in-law rushed to replace her. This was originally out of everyone's revolutionary enthusiasm, and everyone wanted to contribute to the liberation war. It was a revolutionary story; but the author let Aunt Liu tell her two daughters-in-law these two sentences:
    "Sisters-in-law are fighting to replace me, I am happy,
    It can be seen that you are a piece of filial piety."
    This is completely wrong. This is to explain the active actions of two revolutionary women as Mulan serving in the army for her father under feudal rule. Not only is it propagating feudal thought, but it is also completely inconsistent with the facts. Another example is "Great Production," which writes about an old man and his three sons living together; the third son is a loafer, listened to the ghost plan of his lazy woman, and separated from everyone; as a result, he starved and suffered the lesson, and then joined everyone again, and both of them vowed to be hardworking people. This is also good, the purpose is to explain that lazy women and lazy men are not allowed, and also to tell everyone that the power of mutual aid production is great. However, in the author's thinking, because he did not clarify another issue, the theme was confused, that is, he entangled the transformation of loafers with the promotion of mutual aid production and the feudal concept of persuading people not to separate, so that the theme was shifted, making people feel that he was advocating the theory of five generations living under one roof. There is also a point to note here, that is, this work is a modified version of an old thing, the structure and routines are the same, only a few key words have been changed, and it is staged as a new work promoting new ideas. It is an extremely simple way of putting new wine in old bottles. In fact, this is not possible, and it will easily go wrong. It is said that this work is even more popular, the reason is that the whole article has a lot of jokes, and it is a familiar old routine, everyone goes to listen with a curious attitude, it is not the success of new quyi. I suggest the author revise it to clarify the ideological theme. Another example is "Daughter Hero Wang Guixiang," which is the story of a girl during the Anti-Japanese War who was forced by the enemy's power but did not surrender and escaped from danger by killing the enemy. However, the author actually distorted the meaning of this heroic story of resistance against Japan. At the beginning, he wrote a poem saying that the purpose of this story is to praise this girl for "sacrificing her life to protect her chastity." In the main text, it is all about this purpose. This woman did not care about the resistance against Japan in the years before she was captured by the enemy, she just hid everywhere; after she was captured, until she risked killing the enemy, she did not connect to any national indignation, but simply started from "preserving her chastity" to accomplish this major event. What is promoted here is an inexplicable idea. "Preserving chastity" and avoiding being humiliated by the enemy is certainly necessary; but attributing the starting point of women killing the enemy to resist Japan to this is very insufficient. It is also very unnecessary to find such an ideological model to promote.
    Secondly, the language is rough. The main problem in this aspect is rhyming, which makes the words appear unnatural. "The strange rocks are varied," no one says "varied" like that. "Still the same as usual," this sentence is not good, "the same" is even more fabricated. "Climbed up the mountain peak in one breath," "teeth chattering in the mouth," "blood gushing red and fresh," "each and every warrior is full of energy"; these "mountain peaks," "chattering," "red and fresh," "full of energy," may be hard to add a word to make up the syllables. Such things. There are also clichés. Our authors do not cherish their products, do not show creativity, but plagiarize clichés. For example, describing the scene of our army's hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, it is actually these postures:
    "This one plays the old tree rooting well,
    That one plays the golden rooster standing independently skillfully,
    This one is a boy worshiping Guanyin,
    That one is Erlang carrying a mountain for a journey,
    This one is a tiger leaving the mountain with great energy,
    That one is a dragon coming out of the sea particularly fierce."
    Isn't this taking the heroic battle as a joke? Also, still using "willow leaf eyebrows" and "apricot eyes" to describe female comrades, insisting that our soldiers are "as fierce as wolves and tigers," "better than orangutans." These are the worst examples of crude production. There are also crude and cliché places, not many examples. Because the movement is still in its early stages, some people are just planning to move from the old quyi to the new, and the market demand is large, and the creative output is small, these problems are unavoidable. However, we must pay attention to this issue and not consciously engage in carelessness. And don't be confused by popularity, those clichés are originally very popular, can we say that's good? On January 5th, I was very honored to hear Mr. Lao She write and sing "Celebrating the New Year" at the Beijing Hotel. Comparing it with Zhao Shuli's "Examining the Witch," these are really good works; naturally, they don't bother to use a corrupt word or a rotten tune, it's creation. We must learn from them and use such good works to overthrow feudal culture and seize the position.

    评“新曲艺丛书”
    王春
    新曲艺丛书，由大众文艺创作研究会等三个单位合编，新华书店出版，已出了六辑，听说还要出。已出版的这六本，包括唱词三十八篇。题材是各方面的：写战斗的，写生产的，反封建的，反迷信的等等都有。近来各娱乐场所很叫座的《考神婆》《大生产》等都在里边。概括说来，这是一套好书。
    “封建文化”所占领的“阵地”，确实是很广大的；讲一个故事给大家听，就知道了。我们从前一起在华北新华书店工作的一位同志，抗战以前是在一家专门出版旧小说、唱本、百中经、玉匣记等东西的书店做事的；他说他的老板有一次给店员们讲话，说明业务大有前途。老板说：多年以来，发生过多次新文化、新文艺一类的运动，但我看他们都不行。他们的书印起来，每种不过一两千册，而我印金镯玉环记、渊海子评等，一下总是二三十万册。由此看来，天下还是我的！这些话也许有点吹牛，不过，这样的事实是不容许我们忽视的。时至今日，封建阶级已经倒台，封建文化失掉了帝王师相的支持，好像是理该不行的了，然而并不是这样容易。他们本身虽没有反动宣传的组织，也没有封建主义者在领导他们，然而他们还有着极大的势力，占领着一个人口众多的市场。他们所以能够存在的原因有两个：一个是经过了几千年封建教育的结果，竟使得群众把这种可恶的文化当成了自己的东西，所以毛主席说：“反对群众脑子里的这个敌人，甚至比反对日本帝国主义还困难！”一个是我们中间有些人，一向只注意了高级的创作什么等等，而对他们采取了鄙夷不屑的态度。他有群众基础，天下本来就是他的；我们却不去和他争，不夺取他的阵地，自管自的，他岂有不稳坐江山之理？
    近来，我们的形势不同些了，我们有了这方面的组织，有了领导和计划，当成大事来干。他们也有点不很安然了，听说打磨厂的出版家们，也感到旧的东西群众不欢迎，希望我们给他们弄些新东西印。新曲艺丛书等类著作，正是这种取封建文化而代之的适时的好书。
    这六本作品，是选辑起来的，都是较好的著作。例如描写山东妇女热忱支援前线的《女运粮》（陶钝作），描写唐山人民欢欣庆祝人民政协的《李大娘看会》（王命夫作），描写江北人民勇敢帮助解放军渡江的《叶大嫂推船渡江》（苗培时、曹子戈作），叙述杀敌英雄事迹的《赵享德大闹正太路》（苗培时作）等很多篇，都是真正能表现出人民革命力量的作品，可以把五女兴唐传之类挤出阵地。另外还有一篇很好的，是赵树理改写的《考神婆》。这篇作品，名义上是平顺县北头村四五个农民作的，其实差不多就等于赵树理作的。当时还在太行山，我们收到这篇很原始的投稿，由赵树理一字一句重新写过，成了现在这么一篇很优美的作品。它的好处是，没有一个凑韵的句子，没有一句趁板的废话，自然上口，毫无矫揉造作之处。
    说到这里，就得谈到这些作品还存着的一些缺点方面来了。首先是思想上有时还不免把封建意识引进来。例如《女运粮》，叙述的是山东诸城地方福台庄有次要急运公粮到前线，可惜村上男丁不足，于是妇女们自愿赶驴去送。有位刘大娘好容易在村民大会上争到一个出差的名额，高兴得回家准备出发，她的两个儿媳妇却抢着要替她去。这本是出于大家的革命热忱，谁都想为解放战争效力，是一段革命佳话；但作者却让刘大娘给两位儿媳讲了这么两句话：
    “妯娌们争着替我我心喜，
    可见是你们一片孝心肠”。
    这是完全错了的。这是把两位革命妇女的积极行动，解释为封建统治下替父从军的花木兰，不但宣传的是封建思想，而且根本就不合事实。又如《大生产》，写的是一个老头三个儿子，合伙过日子；三儿是个二流子，听了自己懒女人的鬼打算，和大家分了家；结果饿了肚子，受了困难的教训，又和大家合起来，两口都发誓要作勤劳人民。这也是好的，旨在于说明懒婆懒汉当不得，而且告诉大家大伙互助生产力量大。但在作者的思想上，却因为对于另外的一个问题没澄清，结果把主题搅得很混乱，那就是他把改造二流子与提倡互助生产和劝人不要分家的封建观念纠缠在一起，以致把主题转移了，使人觉得他是在提倡五世同堂论。这里边还有一点须注意的，就是这作品是拿一篇旧东西改作的，架子、套数照旧，只是把要紧字样改了几个，就作为一个宣传新思想的新作品上演，是极简单的旧瓶装新酒办法。而这其实是不行的，这很会弄不好。听说这篇作品还更叫座，其原因就是因为全篇有着很多笑料，又是群众熟悉的旧套翻新，大家以好奇的态度去听，并不是新曲艺的成功。我建议作者修改一下，把思想主旨澄清。又如“女儿英雄王贵香”，是写的抗战期间一位姑娘，被敌威逼不辱、杀敌脱险的故事。但作者竟把这种英勇抗战的故事的意义歪曲了，在开篇就写了一首诗，说这故事的宗旨在于表彰这姑娘“舍身冒险保贞节”。在正文中也全是围绕着这个宗旨在说话，这个女子在未被敌人抓去的几年中对抗战毫不关心，只是东躲西藏；待到被抓以后，直到冒险杀敌，也都没连系到什么国家民族的义愤，还是单纯从“保全贞节”出发而成此大事。这所宣传的又是莫明其妙的思想。“保全贞节”，免受敌寇污辱，这固然应该；但把妇女杀敌抗战的出发点都归结到这里，那是很不够的。找这种思想典型来宣传，也是很不必要的。
    其次便是语言的粗糙，这方面主要的毛病在于凑韵，使话语显得不自然。“怪石嶙嶙样万千”，“样万千”没人这样说。“还和平时一样般”，这句话就不好，“一样般”越发是捏造的。“一口气爬上山尖尖”“满嘴牙齿打颤颤”，“血水冒的红鲜鲜”，“众战士一个个精神充充”；这些“山尖尖”“打颤颤”“红鲜鲜”“精神充充”，可能是硬叠上个字来补足音节。诸如此类。还有的就是抄用滥调，我们的作者们不珍重自己的产品，不表现创造力，却去抄袭陈套。例如描写我军和敌人肉搏战的情形，竟是这些架势：
      “这一个老树盘根玩得好，
      那一个金鸡独立耍得精，
      这一个童子就把观音拜，
      那一个二郎担山走一程，
      这一个猛虎离山劲头大，
      那一个蛟龙出海特别凶。”
    这不是把英勇的战斗拿来开玩笑吗？还有，照旧拿“柳叶眉”、“杏子眼”来形容女同志，硬说我们的战士“如狼似虎”，“比过了猩猩”。这些都是粗制滥造的最坏的例子。粗恶滥调的地方还有，不多举了。因为运动还在开始，有些人又是刚打算从旧曲艺里走向新生，再加市场需要大，创作产量小，这些毛病是难免的。然而我们一定得注意这个问题，不要有意识的来草率从事。而且也不要拿叫座来迷惑自己，那些滥调本来正是很叫座的，我们能说那就好吗？我一月五日很荣幸的在北京饭店听过老舍先生自写自唱的《过新年》，再拿来和赵树理的《考神婆》对比，他们这真是好作品；自然，不屑用一个腐词和一句烂调，是创作。我们要向他们学习，拿这样的好作品去把封建文化挤倒，把阵地夺过来。
