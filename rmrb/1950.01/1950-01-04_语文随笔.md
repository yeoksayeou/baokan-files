    Language Jottings
    Ye Shengtao
    Reading Mr. Jiang Hua's article "We Must Strive to Expel Confusing Vocabulary" in the seventh issue of *Wenyi Bao* was very interesting. He casually picked some examples from recent poems, such as:

    "Driving us onto a shared destiny"
    "The whistle of the worker on duty sounded"
    "Without a drop of water, yet begging to drink someone else's urine"
    "The city wall and the roof ridge
    Were caressed by the branches"

    Pointing out that the poets' use of words like "driving," "sounded," "urine," and "caressed" exposed the shortcomings in their efforts to learn the language. His explanation can be said to be fair and reasonable, "It is not entirely the poet's own confusion; this is indeed a transitional phenomenon in the development of Chinese literary language." Finally, he expressed his wish, "demanding that poets and writers consciously and actively shorten their 'transition' in language learning. Strive to adopt and refine lively vocabulary from the mouths of living people! Abandon these confusing languages and strive to expel such vocabulary!"

    After reading this article, the first thing that came to mind was that confusing vocabulary is not only found in poetry, not only in literary works, but almost everywhere, wherever there is writing. Unfortunately, I don't have the habit of taking notes, otherwise I could copy at least a hundred or so. The so-called transitional period is not short either. The "May Fourth" Movement has already passed its thirtieth anniversary, but there are still such phenomena. It should be blamed on those of us who wield the pen for failing to "consciously and actively shorten our 'transition' in language learning."

    The second thing that came to mind is that it's not just vocabulary; grammar and rhetoric probably also have problems. Just like the "当" (*dāng*) in “当下工的汽笛鸣过” ("The whistle of the worker on duty sounded"), it was commonly used in classical Chinese (“当尧之时” "In the time of Yao" “当其壮年”"In his prime"), and it is also commonly used in modern articles, but it comes from translated texts, where translators translate "(When)" as "当" (*dāng*). Ordinary language never uses this "当" (*dāng*), except for those who intentionally or unintentionally pick up the grammar from books. Also, like Mr. Jiang Hua's "采用与洗练有生命的词汇" ("adopt and refine lively vocabulary"), two verbs connected by a conjunction, leading to a noun in the accusative case, this kind of grammar is very popular now. You can see it in documents and hear it at gatherings. This comes from books, and books come from translating or imitating Western languages. Our general language does not have this kind of grammar. This is what I think. It's okay to adopt ancient and foreign grammar. Adoption can enrich our language. However, there are conditions: first, it must make up for the defects of our original grammar; second, it must work, be conventionally accepted, and adopted by everyone. Whether "当…" (*dāng…*) and the grammar of two parallel verbs followed by a noun in the accusative case have enriched our language, and whether our original grammar has no way to express the same ideas, are all debatable. As for whether it works or not, we'll have to see after some time. Being popular in documents and at gatherings may not count. It only truly works when it takes root in the mouths of most people.

    Let's talk about rhetoric. We often see "义愤填膺" ("filled with righteous indignation") used in telegrams and news reports. This year, October 1st, the founding of the People's Republic of China, and recently Marshal Stalin's 70th birthday, we saw phrases like "欢欣若狂" ("overjoyed") in various articles. I don't approve of using this kind of language, first because it is classical Chinese and not used in ordinary language. Second, and more importantly, this kind of expression is no longer effective. If you say "义愤填膺" ("filled with righteous indignation"), people have no way to understand to what extent your "righteous indignation" is strong. If you say "欢欣若狂" ("overjoyed"), people only know that you are happy. If you search in living language, the effect is much stronger. The problem is that people don't search and don't learn.

    语文随笔
    叶圣陶
    看《文艺报》第七期，江华先生的一篇“要努力驱逐使人糊涂的词汇”很有意思。他随便在近来的诗篇中找些例子，像
    “驱迫着我们走上共同的命运”
    “当下工的汽笛鸣过”
    “没有一滴水，而要讨喝别人的尿便”
    “城楼和屋脊
    都被树条拍抚着”
    指出诗人运用“驱迫”“鸣过”“尿便”“拍抚”这些词汇，暴露了他们在语言学习的努力中还有缺憾。他的解释可以说是平情之论，“并不完全是诗人本身的糊涂，这实在也是中国文学语言发展时期的过渡现象。”最后他表示愿望，“要求诗人们作家们自觉地主动地缩短自己在语言学习上的“过渡”。努力从活人的嘴上，采用与洗练有生命的词汇！放弃这些使人糊涂的语言，努力驱逐这样的词汇！”
    看完这一篇，头一个想到的是使人糊涂的词汇不但诗里有，不但文艺作品里有，几乎到处都有，有文字的处所都有。可惜平时没有随手摘录的习惯，不然至少一抄就是百来个。所谓过渡时期也不算短了，“五四”已经做过了三十周年，可是还有这样的现象，该怪咱们拿笔杆儿的始终没有能够“自觉地主动地缩短自己在语言学习上的‘过渡’”。
    第二个想到的，不但词汇吧，语法跟修词式恐怕也有问题。就像“当下工的汽笛鸣过”的“当”，文言里是常用的（“当尧之时”“当其壮年”），现在文章里也常用，可是从翻译文字来的，翻译家把（When）翻了“当”。一般的语言决不说这个“当”，除了有意无意沾染了书本子上的语法的。还有，像江华先生文章里的“采用与洗练有生命的词汇”，两个动词用个连词连起来，贯到目的格的名词，这样的语法现在很流行了，文件上可以见到，集会上可以听到。这是从书本子来的，书本子又是从翻译西洋语文或者仿效西洋语文来的，我国一般的语言没有这样的语法。我是这么想，古来的外来的语法都不妨采用，采用了才可以丰富咱们的语言。不过有条件，一要弥补咱们原来语法的缺陷，二要行得开，约定俗成，大家采用。像“当……”以及两个并列的动词下面贯到目的格的语法，是不是丰富了咱们的语言，咱们原来的语法是不是没有办法表现相同的意念，都是可以讨论的。至于行得开行不开，得过一些时候再看，在文件上集会上流行未必能算数，要在大多数人的嘴上生根才真是行开了。
    再说修辞式。咱们当看见“义愤填膺”，通电里用，报道文章里也用。今年十月一日中华人民共和国成立，最近斯大林元帅七十大寿，咱们在各色各样的文章里看见了“欢欣若狂”之类的语句。我不赞成运用这种语句，第一因为是文言，一般的语言里不说。第二，尤其重要的，这种说法已经不生效果。你说“义愤填膺”，人家没法理会你那“义愤”强烈到什么程度，你说“欢欣若狂”，人家也不过知道你在那里欢喜罢了。如果从活的语言里去找，效果强的多的是，毛病就在不去找，不去学习。
