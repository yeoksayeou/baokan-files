Local Experiences Introduce Online Production and Disaster Relief (II)
From Two Villages See Production Disaster Relief Methods
Internal Affairs Ministry Research Office

First, let’s see how Gaozhang Village, District One, Shouzhang County, launched a production self-salvation upsurge.

The village has 189 households, 873 people, and 2,857 mu of cultivated land. The late autumn harvest was completely submerged by the Yellow River flood. About two-thirds of the households in the village have enough food only to last until the end of the year. As of last November, 11 households, a total of 22 people, had fled the famine. Initially, cadres and the masses felt that the threat of the disaster was very serious. They were afraid of price fluctuations in transportation and worried about the lack of sales for homespun cloth in weaving, so they stopped in the face of difficulties. There was a general mentality of relying on government loans and grain. There was almost no confidence in "production for self-salvation."

		Promote the creativity of the masses

In order to break the deadlock and overcome the masses' reliance mentality, under the leadership of the county and district Party and government, the village's Communist Party branch first conveyed the policy of production for self-salvation at the党员大会 (Party member congress), analyzed the village's situation, and pointed out the favorable conditions for production for self-salvation. They criticized Song Deying (public security officer) for being unenthusiastic about production and unwilling to lead the masses in repairing embankments and commended Chen Shaoying (branch secretary) for actively leading the masses in flood prevention and wheat planting. At the same time, at the enlarged village cadre meeting and the mass meeting, they also adopted the method of specific accounting, criticizing those who emphasized difficulties and waited and watched, and commending those who actively produced and had confidence in self-salvation. After everyone's deliberation and brainstorming, the enthusiasm of the masses for production was initially mobilized, and the mentality of simply relying on public relief was reversed.

After the mass meeting was held, the general public's confidence in production for self-salvation was still not firm. Communist Party members and cadres then played a leading role, educating the masses through activists among the masses to further encourage the upsurge of production for self-salvation. Communist Party branch secretary Chen Shaoying personally led women in weaving. In addition to using the accounting method at the women's weaving mobilization meeting to prove the benefits of weaving, he also invited Xiao Xuequan, a weaving expert, to speak at the meeting. Xiao Xuequan is a widow with only her mother-in-law. All five mu of her land were submerged, and she relied entirely on weaving with her mother-in-law to make a living. She said at the meeting:

"Everyone says weaving is not profitable, but the money I earned from weaving last year even bought seven fen of land. You earn one jin for every three jin you spin. It's not true that it's not profitable. What will you eat if the spinning wheel doesn't move?"

Village chief Wang Zhaisen led the flour mill. Of the five millstones in the village, only Lu Jimeng's group was working. Others said it was not profitable and were unwilling to do it. He then took Lu Jimeng's group as an example and explained it to everyone:

"Lu Jimeng's group has a total of eight households, 32 people. They grind 24 jin of mung beans a day, producing 7.5 jin of vermicelli. One jin of vermicelli can be exchanged for 3.2 jin of wheat. The vermicelli alone is enough to cover the cost, and the bean dregs are all profit. One vermicelli yields eight buckets of dregs. Thirty-two bean dreg窝窝 (wōwō, a type of corn bread), mixed with two jin of rice, can make 92 wōwō. Adults and children eat an average of five each per day, enough to feed 19 people…Most people's food and drink problems are solved." After everyone's deliberation and the experience introduction of these activists, the masses' doubts were dispelled! The weaving group soon expanded to 13 groups, with as many as 125 people participating. The flour mill also developed from one group to five groups. The masses all said:

"The lazy are the ones who go hungry, it's really true! If others can do it, we can do it too."

Of course, there were many difficulties in the specific organization of production. Some people lacked labor, and some lacked funds. In order to overcome the difficulties, mutual assistance and cooperation were used to solve them in a timely manner. In this way, the upsurge of production for self-salvation was smoothly launched. For example, Chen Peixian participated in the flour mill group but lacked funds, so Chen Shaoying lent him 45 jin of beans, and he contributed a full labor force. The profits and losses were shared by the two according to the whole share. Another two households also lacked capital, so they only contributed labor and calculated dividends based on the number of people. An elderly widow took out her grain as a share capital and joined the flour mill group, and she could eat wōwō and drink mung bean soup every day. When repairing the embankment, some people did not have small carts, so they borrowed them through mutual assistance, and as a result, 32 people were able to participate in the work smoothly.

In addition to grinding flour and weaving, various kinds of sideline production were organized according to the practical conditions. Men, women, old, and young all worked together, and the movement of production for self-salvation was fully launched. The village organized three households of carpenters with technical skills to build warehouses. Fifteen households without technical skills participated in selling cabbage and sweet potatoes. Nine households participated in transporting grain. The old man's班 (bān, group) and the children's团 (tuán, corps) were also mobilized to collect firewood and manure. More than 50 women went to the non-disaster areas in the east to pick up vegetable leaves. No one in the village, men, women, old, or young, was willing to be idle. Under the correct leadership of the county and district, the entire labor force of the village has been put into production. At present, the masses have all made their own plans by household and have full confidence in production for self-salvation and a stable transition through the disaster. It is certain that the leadership of this work will be strengthened through the village people's representative大会 (dàhuì, assembly) and the existing achievements will be further improved to fully overcome the disaster.

		Overcoming the viewpoint of relying solely on loans

Let's see what lessons can be learned from the disaster relief work in Xicaomiao Village, District Six, Nanwang County, Pingyuan Province:

The village has 115 households, a total of 525 people. Sixty percent of the houses in the village were flooded and collapsed, but the loss of grain and important production tools was not great. At the same time, the village has a habit of engaging in sideline production. In addition to most women being able to weave, 32 households, about 28 percent of the total number of households, regularly engage in sideline occupations such as papermaking, vinegar making, oil pressing, cotton ginning, carpentry, and transportation. Less than one-third of the households are without grain after the New Year. As of November 20 last year, eight households had fled the famine. Moreover, before the work team entered the village, the masses were brewing production for self-salvation (small-scale販運 (fànyùn, buying and selling)), and more than 20 households had already started activities.

In order to create experience in production and disaster relief work, the county designated the village as a key village. The county bank, the Pingyuan Provincial Branch, and the special commissioner's office of the bank transferred 10 cadres to form a work team. They arrived in the village on November 5 to start work. At the beginning, the work team lacked a correct understanding of the policy of leading production for disaster relief, and the county had no clear instructions, so they were frightened by the masses' cries of suffering. Therefore, they mistakenly held an attitude of bestowing favors and proposed "organizing and providing loans" at the first mass meeting. This inadvertently promoted the development of the masses' reliance mentality. In half a day, 15 "mutual aid groups" appeared in the village, and they put forward a request for a loan of 25,000 jin of grain. According to the county's total production loan of more than 200,000 jin, there are 247 severely affected villages. The work team did not grasp the specific situation in coordination with the local cadres based on the amount of the loan, so they blindly decided to lend the village 10,000 jin of grain, and four groups immediately received 2,350 jin. Since the mass meeting approved the first batch of production loans, the masses in the village and nearby villages all said:

"The bank has come to Xicaomiao!"

The result of using loans for disaster relief was that Han Yongyu and others, who had not yet received production loans, stopped their original small-scale販運 (fànyùn, buying and selling) in order to show that they were poor and could not afford to produce. Han Jinrun's paper mill group could have operated with its own capital, but it also "closed down" for the same reason. Dongcaomiao Village was also affected by the village, and 19 laborers stayed at home waiting for loans. Han Youtang and four others, none of whom could fish, originally planned to promote sweet potatoes with a capital of 50 jin of grain per person, but in order to get a loan, they formed a fishing group and made a fishing plan: "Capital 510 jin, loan 450 jin of wheat, buy 40 nets, buy one boat." When the loan arrived, they sent two people to sell 290 jin of wheat and spent a lot of travel expenses to Yanzhou to buy four nets as a cover, and the rest was used for the illegal business of贩白银 (fàn báiyín, trafficking silver). Moreover, due to the mechanical implementation of the provision of "loans to organized masses," cloth vendor Han Chuanxiao also joined the fishing group. Moreover, many of the so-called mutual aid groups simply divided the grain equally after receiving it. Military属 (shǔ, dependents) Cao Yuwen was poor and had no labor, and could have borrowed money to sell peanuts, but because no one helped him, he did not get the capital. As a result, there was a lot of complaint. Village cadres in nearby villages also took the loan plans of 10,000 jin and 8,000 jin to ask the work team to honor them.

When the Pingyuan Provincial Government's disaster area work team inspected the village's work, they discovered this serious deviation and immediately corrected it. First, they educated the cadres based on specific facts and started from small things based on the existing manpower, financial resources, and materials of the masses. They implemented the policy of production for disaster relief and organized the masses to engage in various kinds of sideline production. After getting through the thoughts of the cadres and the masses, they immediately stopped the loans. Those that had already been loaned were allocated to households that really lacked funds. For Han Youtang's group, which was engaged in the illegal business of贩白银 (fàn báiyín, trafficking silver), they left a small part to encourage a household in the group that really lacked funds to engage in legitimate production, and recovered the rest.

At the same time, at the village cadre meetings and mass meetings, the work team cadres made self-criticisms; they broke the masses' reliance mentality through specific accounting. They organized production activists to engage in贩運 (fànyùn, buying and selling) and other production. In terms of loan methods, they stipulated that after the loans were given to poor households, they should engage in mutual assistance and cooperation with other households under the principle of voluntary waiting. This saved the past mistakes and put the work on the right track.

After reading the above overview of the disaster relief work in the two villages, we can see that whether the disaster relief method is correct or not is extremely important. It is hoped that comrades engaged in disaster relief work in various places will pay special attention to this so as to complete our disaster relief tasks.

    各地经验介绍生产救灾线上（二）
    从两个村看生产救灾的办法
    内务部研究室
    先看寿张一区高掌村是怎样掀起了生产自救热潮的。
    该村一八九户，八七三人；耕地二、八五七亩。自黄河水灾侵袭，晚秋全淹。全村约三分之二的户，食粮只能维持到年底。截至去年十一月，逃荒的已达十一户，共有二十二人。一开始，干部及群众感到灾荒的威胁非常严重。搞运输怕物价波动，搞纺织怕土布没销路，都停止在困难面前；普遍存在依赖政府贷粮款的思想。对“生产自救”几乎毫无信心。
            发扬群众的创造力
    为了打开困难局面，克服群众依赖思想，在县区党政领导下，该村中共支部首先在党员大会上，传达了生产自救方针，分析了本村情况，指出生产自救的有利条件。并对生产不积极，不愿领导群众修堤的宋得营（公安员）进行了批评；对积极领导群众防汛与种麦的陈少营（支书）加以表扬。同时，在扩大村干会与群众会上，也采用通过具体算账；批评强调困难、观望等待的人，表扬积极生产、有自救信心的人。经过大家的酝酿与想办法，初步发动了群众生产的积极性，扭转了单纯依靠公家救济的思想。
    在群众大会召开后，一般群众对生产自救的信心仍不坚定。中共党员和干部便发挥带头作用，通过群众中的积极分子来教育群众，进一步鼓动生产自救的热潮。中共支书陈少营亲自领导妇女纺织，除在动员妇女纺织大会上用算账方法证明了纺织有利外，还把纺织能手肖学泉请到会上讲话。肖学泉是个寡妇，只婆媳二人，五亩地全被淹了，全靠婆媳两辆车纺花吃饭。她在会上说：
    “都说纺织没利，我去年纺织挣下的钱还买了七分地。纺三斤赚一斤，没利是假的。难道车子不动就有啥吃了？”
    村长王宅森领导粉坊，全村五盘磨，只有吕继孟组一盘动着，别人都说没利不愿干。他便拿吕继孟组作例子，算给大家听：
    “吕继孟组一共有八户，三十二人。一天磨二十四斤绿豆，出七斤半粉条，一斤换三斤二两麦子，光粉条就够本了，渣浆净落。一个粉出八桶浆，三十二个豆渣窝窝，掺二斤米，可作九十二个窝窝。大人小孩平均每天吃五个，够吃十九人。……大部分人的吃喝解决了。”经过大家酝酿与这些积极分子的经验介绍，群众的疑虑打消了！纺织组便马上发展到十三个，参加的有一百二十五人之多。粉坊也由一组发展成五组了。群众都说：
    “饿的是懒人，真不假！人家能干，咱就能干。”
    当然，在具体组织生产时，困难是很多的。有些人没劳力，有些人没资金。为了克服困难，便及时通过互助合作的方式来解决。这样，生产自救热潮便顺利展开了。例如陈培贤参加粉坊组没资金，陈少营便借给他四十五斤豆子，由他出个整劳力，赔赚二人按整股分摊。另二户也缺本钱，便光出劳力，算人股分红。有个孤寡老太太，她拿出粮食作股本，参加了粉坊组，每天可以吃窝窝喝绿豆浆。修堤时有些人没小车，通过互助借小车，结果使三十二人顺利的参加了工作。
    除磨粉、纺织外，根据现实条件，组织各式各样的副业生产，男、女、老、少齐动手，便全面展开了生产自救运动。该村对有技术的三户木匠，是组织他们盖仓库。没技术的十五户，参加了贩白菜、红芋。九户参加了运粮。老头班、儿童团也发动起来拾柴、拾粪。五十多个妇女到东边非灾区拾菜叶。全村男、女、老、少谁也不肯闲着。在县、区的正确领导下，全村的劳动力已整个投入生产中。目前，群众都按户作出了自己的计划，对生产自救、稳渡灾荒，具备了充分的信心。待通过村人民代表大会加强这一工作的领导，与现有成绩进一步的提高，全面战胜灾荒是有把握的。
            克服专靠贷款的观点
    再从平原省南旺六区西曹庙村的救灾工作中看得到些什么教训：
    该村一一五户，计五二五人。该村房屋百分之六十被水淹坍，但粮食及重要生产工具损失并不大；同时该村向有从事副业生产习惯，除妇女大部会纺织外，经常从事造纸、作醋、榨油、弹花、木匠、运输等副业的就有三十二户，约占总户数的百分之二十八。年后无粮的，尚不到三分之一。截至去年十一月二十日，逃荒外出的有八户。而且当工作组进村前，群众都在酝酿生产自救（小本贩运），已有二十余户开始进行活动。
    为了创造生产救灾工作经验，县确定该村为重点村。由县银行、平原省分行及专署银行办事处调干部十人，组成工作组。十一月五日到村展开工作。开始工作组由于对领导生产救灾工作的方针缺乏正确认识，县又无明确指示，为群众一片叫苦声所吓倒。因之，就错误地抱着用恩赐观点，在第一个群众大会上便提出“组织起来，进行贷款”。无形中助长了群众依赖思想的发展。半天功夫，全村出现了十五个“互助组”，并且提出两万五千斤贷粮的要求。按全县生产贷粮共二十余万斤，仅重灾村即有二四七个。工作组未根据贷粮额数，配合当地干部掌握具体情况，便盲目确定给该村贷粮一万斤，并有四个组当即领到二千三百五十斤。自从群众大会批准了第一批生产贷粮，该村与附近各村群众都说：
    “西曹庙来了银行了！”
    贷粮救灾的结果，使尚未领到生产贷粮的韩永玉等，为了表示穷，搞不起生产，便停止了原已进行的小本贩运。韩金润的纸坊组，本来用自己的资本可以干，但也在同样原因下“关门大吉”了。东曹庙村由于受了该村的影响，也有十九个劳动力停在家里等贷款。韩有堂等五个人，谁也不会捕鱼，本来打算以每人五十斤粮食的资本推红芋，但为了争取贷款，搞成个捕鱼组，作了捕鱼计划：“资本五百一十斤，贷麦四百五十斤，买网四十帖，买船一只”。等贷款到手，却派了两个人，卖麦二百九十斤，并花了许多路费，到兖州买网四帖作掩护，其余全搞了贩白银的违法生意。更由于机械执行“贷给有组织的群众”的规定，布贩韩传孝也加入了捕鱼组。而且一般所谓互助组不少是领粮平分。军属曹玉文贫苦无劳力，本可贷款卖花生，因为无人互助，便没贷到本钱。结果，一片怨言。附近各村村干也拿了一万斤、八千斤的贷粮计划要求工作组兑现。
    当平原省府灾区工作队检查该村工作时，发现了这种严重偏向，即立刻进行了纠正。首先根据具体事实教育干部，以群众现有人、财、物力为基础，从小处作起。贯彻生产救灾的方针，组织群众各式各样的副业生产。并在打通干部、群众思想后，立即停止了贷款。已贷下的，调剂给真正缺乏资金户。对作白银违法生意的韩有堂组，除留给小部分，促使该组中一户真正缺乏资金的进行正当生产外，其余全部追回。
    同时，在村干部会与群众大会上，由工作组干部作自我检讨；通过具体算账，打破群众依赖思想。组织生产积极分子从事贩运及其他生产。在贷款方式上，规定贷给困难户后，使其在等候自愿原则下与其他户进行互助合作。这样才挽救了过去的错误，使工作稳步走上正轨。
    我们看罢上述两个村的救灾工作概况，可知救灾办法正确与否，关系极大。希望各地从事救灾工作的同志特别注意，以便完成我们救灾的任务。
