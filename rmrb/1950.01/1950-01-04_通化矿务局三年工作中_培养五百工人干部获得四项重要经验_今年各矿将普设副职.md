[From Our Correspondent in Northeast China] In the past three years, the Liaodong Tonghua Mining Bureau has trained 533 cadres, of which 454 are of worker origin, and the rest are staff and students. There are four methods for training worker cadres: (1) Utilizing night schools, pithead studies, and various meetings to carry out education more universally. Then, individual education is given to workers who are progressing faster and have prestige, and they are assigned specific tasks. Those who complete the tasks are commended, and those who do not are helped to find the reasons and given guidance so that they do not become discouraged and continue to progress. (2) Drawing active elements from production for rotational training, in addition to general class education, strengthening education in business and leadership methods to improve work ability, and then promoting them to deputy positions. This method has been more effective. (3) When summarizing and studying work, worker cadres and active elements among the workers are absorbed to participate, and their opinions are sought. Not only are reasonable opinions adopted, but it is also pointed out where the reasonability lies; inappropriate opinions are patiently explained with the reasons why they cannot be implemented, in order to improve their leadership work and ability to recognize problems. (4) On-the-spot education is carried out in the form of apprenticeship in the work, which is also quite effective.

The general characteristics of newly promoted worker cadres are: familiarity with the business, good contact with workers, enthusiastic and willing to work, and able to overcome difficulties to complete tasks. For example, Lu Zhende, a coal miner at the Shiren Coal Mine, was promoted to pit leader of the No. 5 pit. When repairing the No. 5 pit, the roof was very high, and at first no one dared to start repairing it. He stood up and took the lead, promoting everyone to complete the task. The new cadres have great prestige among the workers. The shortcomings are low cultural level, poor technical theory, fewer work methods, and lack of planning in the work. This relies on strengthening leadership in the future and continuing to improve. In order to more systematically train and promote worker cadres, the Mining Bureau has decided to establish deputy positions for all mine cadres this year and is preparing to open cadre training classes.

    通化矿务局三年工作中
    培养五百工人干部获得四项重要经验
    今年各矿将普设副职
    【本报东北讯】辽东通化市矿务局三年来已培养干部五百三十三名，其中工人成份的计四百五十四名，余为职员、学生。培养工人干部的方法共有四种：（一）利用夜校、坑口学习、各种会议，较普遍地进行教育，然后将进步较快，并有威信的工人，进行个别教育，分配给一定任务，完成的予以表扬，没完成的，帮助其找出原因，加以指导，使之不灰心，继续上进。（二）抽调生产中的积极分子轮训，除进行一般的阶级教育外，并加强业务与领导方法的教育，以提高工作能力，然后提拔为副职，这种方法收效较大。（三）在总结、研究工作时，吸收工人干部和工人中的积极分子参加，征求他们的意见，对合理的意见不仅采纳，并指出合理在什么地方；不恰当的意见，则耐心说明不能实行的理由，以提高其领导工作和认识问题的能力。（四）在工作中以带徒弟方式，进行实地教育，收效亦较大。
    一般新提拔的工人干部的特点是：业务熟习，与工人联系较好，工作热情肯干，能够克服困难完成任务。如石人煤矿采炭工人卢振德，提拔为五坑坑长后，在整修五坑时，顶板冒得很高，起初别人都不敢动手整修，他就起来带头，推动大家完成了任务。新干部在工人中很有威信，缺点是文化水平低，技术理论差些，工作办法还少，工作缺乏计划性。这有赖于今后加强领导，继续提高。矿务局为了更有计划地培养和提拔工人干部，决定今年各矿干部都设副职，并准备开干部训练班。
