    People's Bank of China Beijing Branch Trials Mortgage Lending
    Overcoming Cooperative Funding Turnover Obstacles

    [Our Newspaper] The People's Bank of China Beijing Branch's trial implementation of mortgage lending to solve the problem of stockpiled cooperative supply and marketing funds has achieved preliminary good results. This business was one of the resolutions of the urban banking and cooperative finance business conference held in Beijing last winter. The resolution also specifically stipulated that key trials should be conducted in the winter of 1949, starting in places where cooperative warehouses have a foundation for development. This method generally applies to the following two situations: (1) Goods shipped from cooperatives in other places are difficult to sell temporarily. (2) Seasonal items temporarily have no market. Based on this decision, the Cooperative Department of the People's Bank of China Beijing Branch first started a trial at the Beijing Cooperative Warehouse with a working group on December 16 last year. The working group conducted business activities regularly stationed in the cooperative warehouse, based on the interim measures for handling short-term pledge loans formulated by the department. The first loan was undertaken at the end of last year, and the borrower was the Sanhe County Cooperative in Hebei Province. The cooperative originally planned to sell the wheat shipped to Beijing and buy cloth in Beijing to ship back, but because the wheat market was very low at that time, it could not be sold; at the same time, it was eager to ship the cloth back to Sanhe. Under these circumstances, a contract was signed: the Sanhe County Cooperative used 20,000 catties of wheat as collateral and borrowed 4 million yuan from the Cooperative Department, with a monthly interest rate of 1.5% and a term of one week. After obtaining the loan, the cooperative purchased cloth and general merchandise in Beijing and transported them back to the county to supply the urgent needs of the rural areas. When the wheat market in Beijing improved in early January this year, the wheat was sold at a price higher than at the end of last year, and the loan was repaid. Another loan was granted to the Zhangjiakou City General Cooperative, with an amount of 25 million yuan, and the collateral and purpose were similar to those of Sanhe. Although the amounts of these two loans vary, their effect is the same: to solve the accumulation of supply and marketing funds, so that cooperatives can use one set of funds to carry out the business of two sets of funds. This accelerated the speed of exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and enabled cooperatives to develop in completing supply and marketing tasks. This approach obviously has many benefits, but its development is still insufficient. The reasons are: First, some cooperative cadres have an "old way" of doing things, and they dare not use new management techniques and methods, fearing to lose interest. They only calculate how much interest they have to bear each week for the loan, but they do not calculate the role of the funds in turning over more frequently in promoting the exchange of goods and the benefits that the cooperative itself can obtain from this development. Second, if the bank wants to promote the loan business, it should first closely combine with the cooperative warehouse and jointly contact the business object. This has been realized in the first batch of loans. Although the working group stationed in the cooperative warehouse invited more than a dozen cooperative cadres from various places living in the warehouse to hold a forum on January 11, the time was later, the number of invited units was smaller, and it was not continued afterwards. Another problem is that because the personnel who come to Beijing to conduct business are not all responsible cadres, they dare not make decisions on this business model without authorization. In response to this situation, the bank should print some relevant rules or letters and let them take them back for research.
    This loan business will be further developed in the active promotion of banks and cooperative warehouses and the efforts of cooperative cadres to learn and try to use it. (Yu)

### 人民银行北京分行试办抵押放款  克服合作社资金流转障碍

    人民银行北京分行试办抵押放款
    克服合作社资金流转障碍
    【本报讯】人民银行北京分行试办抵押放款，解决合作社供销资金的积压问题，已获初步的良好结果。这项业务是去年冬季在京举行的城市银行合作金融业务会议的决议之一。该决议并具体规定一九四九年冬季先作重点试办，从合作货栈发展有基础的地方开始作起。此办法一般适用于以下两种情况：（一）外地合作社运来之物资一时难于脱售的。（二）带有季节性的物品暂时没有销路的。人民银行北京分行合作部依据这个决定，于去年十二月十六日首先以工作组在北京合作货栈开始试办。工作组根据该部所订定的办理短期质押贷款暂行办法，经常驻在合作货栈里进行业务活动。第一笔贷款是在去年底承做的，贷款者是河北省三河县社。该社原计划把运京的小麦出售，在京购买布匹运回，但因当时小麦行市很低，以致不能脱售；同时又急欲把布匹运回三河，在这种情况下签订了合同：由三河县社以小麦二万斤为押品，向合作部贷到四百万元，规定月息十五分，期限一星期。该社得到贷款后，在京购买了布匹、百货运回县里，供给农村急迫的需要。待至今年一月初北京的小麦行市好转后，乃以高于去年底的价格将小麦卖出，偿还了借款。另一笔是贷给张家口市总社的，款额二千五百万元，押品与用途和三河相似。这两笔贷款数额虽有多有少，但其效果同样是解决供销资金的积压，使合作社可以用一套资金来进行两套资金的业务。促进了城乡物资交流的速度，并使合作社在完成供销任务中得到发展。这种做法，显然有许多好处，但目前开展还不够。原因是：一、若干合作干部有“老一套”作风，不敢使用新的经营技术与方法，怕赔利息。他们对于贷款只是盘算每周要负担利息若干，而不计算资金多一次周转，对物资交流上所起的作用及合作社本身能借此获得发展的好处。二、银行要推行贷款业务，首先应与合作货栈密切结合，共同向业务对象取得联系才行。在首批贷款中已体会到这点。驻在合作货栈的工作组，虽然在一月十一日邀请了十几位住栈的各地合作社干部举行了一个座谈会，但举行的时间较晚，邀请的单位也较少，而以后也未继续举行。另一个问题，因来京进行业务的人员并不都是负责干部，所以对这种经营方式不敢擅自做主。针对此种情况，银行方面应印些有关的章则或函件，由他们带回去研究。
    这种贷款业务，在银行与合作货栈主动推动，和合作干部努力学习试用中，必将进一步得到开展。  （羽）
