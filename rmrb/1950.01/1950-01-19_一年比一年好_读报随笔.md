    "Better Year by Year"
    Yan Ling
    "Nineteen forty-nine was the year of the Chinese people's greatest victory, and also the year of the greatest difficulties. Nineteen fifty will basically overcome our difficulties and consolidate our victory." Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi told us this in his New Year's message to the People's Daily. These are two very simple sentences, but they contain a summary of a historical stage, and at the same time, they are a powerful call to the Chinese people to continue to advance victoriously.
    We are in victory, we are in difficulty; we dare to win because we dare to face difficulties and overcome them. Many of our comrades, in those most difficult years, did not lose heart, did not bow their heads, did not complain, did not retreat. Constant victories encouraged us, and greater victories in the future summoned us, enabling us to achieve today's great victory. But in today's victorious situation, some people are relaxing their fighting will precisely because of victory, and are afraid of suffering again.
    "We have suffered hard for so many years, shouldn't we enjoy ourselves now? Youth will never return, and we won't be able to enjoy it if we wait any longer." So, they demand improved treatment, demand a change of job; if they don't get what they want, they work passively and are not content with their work; some people who have received salaries spend a lot of time and energy every day on "equipping" themselves, and even say: "Isn't the purpose of the revolution to improve the people's lives? Aren't I a member of the people?"... These people have forgotten or refuse to listen to what Chairman Mao said: "We have difficulties," and the people have not yet been freed from the great disasters left by the enemy; these "those who enjoy before the world enjoys" should experience how hard the working people are still living today.
    "China's economy is too backward; we will suffer this year, and we will inevitably suffer next year and the year after that. I think the days of suffering will be long!" Some of these people are willing to endure hardship, but they have little vigor in their work and lack initiative. They are self-proclaimed "noble" sufferers; some are even shrouded in pessimistic emotions, forgetting or not believing what Chairman Mao said: "We have ways, we have hope."
    "This year we won't mention it, but it will be better in nineteen fifty-one – at most, it will be nineteen fifty-two, and then..." These people have envisioned a beautiful life pattern for themselves one or two years later, "full of victorious confidence"; they are only interested in what Chairman Mao said: "Our situation will get better year by year, and it is estimated that next year will be better than this year." (Speech at the Fourth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on December 2nd last year) but they don't think about why the year will be better year by year, how to make the year better year by year, but lie down and wait for a beautiful future to arrive automatically in front of them.
    Many people have some of these thoughts, more or less, and they exist in me as well. We should know that it exists, then beat it back!
    Remember what Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi said. He told us this at the Beijing People's Celebration of the Success of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference on November 23rd last year: "Nineteen fifty may be the last year of our difficulties. If we grit our teeth and get through this year, and with the united efforts of the government and the masses of the people, we may gradually enter a better state." This is a very good explanation of "there are difficulties, there are ways, there is hope"; do not be blindly pessimistic or optimistic, respond to Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's New Year's message: "Fight to overcome our difficulties and consolidate our historical victory!"

### “一年比一年好”  读报随笔

    “一年比一年好”
    燕凌
    “一九四九年是中国人民胜利最大的一年，也是困难最大的一年。一九五○年就要在基本上克服我们的困难与巩固我们的胜利。”刘少奇副主席在给人民日报的新年题词中这样告诉了我们。这是很简单的两句话，而其中包含着一个历史阶段的总结，同时是鼓舞中国人民继续胜利前进的一个有力的号召。
    我们在胜利中，我们在困难中；我们敢于胜利，就因为我们敢于面对困难，克服困难。我们的许多同志，在那最困难的岁月里，没有气馁、没有低头、没有叫苦、没有退缩，不断的胜利鼓舞着我们，未来更大的胜利召引着我们，使我们取得今天如此伟大的胜利。而在今天这样一个胜利的局面下，有些人却正因为胜利的缘故而松懈了战斗的意志，害怕再吃苦了。
    艰苦了多少年，现在还不该享受一下子了？青春一去不复返，再晚享受不上了。”于是，要求改善待遇，要求调换工作；达不到目的，就消极怠工，不安于工作；有某些拿到了薪金的人，每日把许多时间和精力放在“装备”自己上面，还说：“革命的目的还不就是为了改善人民生活吗，我不是人民的一分子吗？”……这些人忘记了或不肯听毛主席所说的：“我们是有困难的”，人民还没有从敌人遗留下的大灾难中解脱出来；这种“先天下之乐而乐”者，是应该体验到今天劳动人民还过着怎样艰苦的生活。
    “中国经济太落后了；今年吃苦，明年、后年也少不了吃苦，吃苦的日子我看长着呢！”这些人有的也肯于吃苦，但在工作上却很少朝气，缺乏积极性，是自命“清高”的吃苦主义者；有的甚至为悲观情绪所笼罩，忘记了或不相信毛主席所说的“我们是有办法的，有希望的”。
    “今年是不提了，到一九五一年就好了——至多也不过一九五二年吧，就可以……。”这些人为自己设想了一幅一年或两年之后的美妙生活的图案，“充满了胜利信心”；他们只对毛主席说的“我们的情况会一年比一年好起来，估计明年要比今年好。”（去年十二月二日在中央人民政府委员会第四次会议上讲话）感到兴趣，却不想为什么一年会比一年好，如何才能做到一年比一年好，而卧着等待美好的未来自动到达他的面前。
    这些思想，很多人多多少少都有一些，在我自己也存在着。我们应该知道它存在，就打退它！
    记着刘少奇副主席的话吧，他去年十一月二十三日在北京各界人民庆祝亚澳工会会议成功大会上是这样告诉我们的：“一九五○年可能是我们困难的最后一年，咬紧牙关渡过这一年，并有政府和人民大众团结一致的努力，我们就可能逐渐地进入佳境。”这是“有困难，有办法，有希望”的很好的说明；不要盲目地悲观或乐观，响应刘少奇副主席新年题词的号召：“为克服我们的困难与巩固我们历史性的胜利而战斗啊！”
