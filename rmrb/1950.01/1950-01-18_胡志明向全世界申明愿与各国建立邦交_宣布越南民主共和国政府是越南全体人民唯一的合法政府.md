Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 17th: Our Central People's Government today received a statement from Ho Chi Minh, President of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, addressed to governments of all countries, dated January 14th. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    After the August Revolution of 1945 overthrew the rule of Japanese and French imperialism in Vietnam, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was established.

    On September 2, 1945, the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a declaration of independence to the Vietnamese people and the world.

    On March 3, 3, 1946, the Vietnamese National Assembly (i.e., National Congress) elected the official government of Vietnam.

    On September 23, 1945, the French colonial army attacked the South. Subsequently, the French imperialists concluded the Preliminary Agreement of March 6, 1946, and the Provisional Convention of September 14, 1946, with Vietnam. However, the French colonialists still violated the peaceful wishes of the French people and continued their unjust war. They also established the Bao Dai puppet government, attempting to use it as a weapon to invade Vietnam and deceive the world.

    The people and army of Vietnam are fighting heroically against the French colonialists to defend the independence of their motherland and are increasingly approaching final victory. After years of resistance, Vietnam has gained the sympathy and support of the people of the world.

    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam hereby declares to the governments of all countries in the world: The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the sole legitimate government of all the Vietnamese people. For the common benefit of the people, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is prepared to establish diplomatic relations with any government that is willing to cooperate in equality and mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, in order to jointly defend world peace and democracy.

                        Ho Chi Minh, President of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
                                         January 14, 1950

    宣布越南民主共和国政府是越南全体人民唯一的合法政府
    【新华社北京十七日电】我国中央人民政府本日接获一月十四日越南民主共和国政府主席胡志明向世界各国政府的申明。申明全文如下：
    一九四五年八月革命，打倒了日、法帝国主义在越南的统治以后，越南民主共和国成立。
    一九四五年九月二日，越南民主共和国临时政府向越南人民及全世界发表了独立宣言。
    一九四六年三月三日越南国会（即国民大会）选举了越南的正式政府。
    一九四五年九月二十三日，法国殖民军进攻南部，其后法帝与越南缔结了一九四六年三月六日的初步协定与一九四六年九月十四日的暂约（临时协约）。但法国殖民者仍旧违背法国人民的和平愿望，而继续进行其非正义的战争。他们又成立了保大傀儡政府，企图用之为侵略越南与欺骗世界的武器。
    越南的人民与军队为了保卫祖国的独立，正对法国殖民者进行着英勇的战斗，并日益接近获得最后胜利。经过数年抗战，越南已得到了世界人民的同情和拥护。
    越南民主共和国政府谨向全世界各国政府宣布：越南民主共和国政府是越南全体人民唯一的合法政府。为了人民的普遍利益，越南民主共和国政府准备与任何愿在平等和互相尊重国家主权及领土的基础上一致合作的政府建立外交关系，以谋共同保卫世界的和平与民主。
