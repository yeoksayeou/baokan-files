    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 15th: The striking workers of the Modena United Foundry in Italy have achieved victory. According to a TASS report from Rome on the 14th, the Modena Metalworkers' Union has reached an agreement with the management of the United Foundry. The employers were forced to abandon the factory closure and refusal to hire, and signed an agreement stipulating that the factory will reopen on the 23rd, employing all the original workers, without reducing a single one.
    Vittorio, Secretary-General of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, wrote in "Unità" on the 14th: "If the police had not supported the illegal factory closure, an agreement could have been reached without bloodshed. This agreement is a formal and clear condemnation of the government's criminal policies."

The complaint included many supporting documents, signed by one hundred and forty-two members of parliament and sixty-eight senators, including Communists, Socialists, and non-party members.

    【新华社北京十五日电】意大利摩登纳联合铸造厂罢工工人已获得胜利。据塔斯社罗马十四日讯：摩登纳金属工人工会已与联合铸造厂厂方达成协议。雇主被迫放弃关厂拒雇，并在协定上签字，规定二十三日重新开厂，雇用原来的全体工人，不能减少一个。
    意大利总工会总书记维多里奥十四日在团结报上撰文指出：“如果没有警察支持非法关厂，本来可以不发生血案而达成协议。这个协定是对政府罪恶政策的正式而明白的谴责。”
