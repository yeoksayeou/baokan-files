Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: TASS Berlin, December 10th dispatch: The West German people held rallies in major cities of the Ruhr region, such as Dusseldorf, Essen, and Dortmund, protesting the Ruhr Statute, the Occupation Statute, and the rearmament of West Germany, defending peace, and supporting the unification of Germany. Tens of thousands of people attended.

    The German News Agency reported: At the rally in Dusseldorf, Lehmann, the chairman of the German (West German) Communist Party, delivered a speech stating: "The Occupation Statute divides Germany and deprives the people of the Western occupied zones of their right to self-determination. The implementation of the Ruhr Statute places West German heavy industry under the control of U.S. monopoly capitalists. The Ruhr Statute puts the West German people in double shackles—the shackles of the German coal barons and the shackles of the U.S. monopoly capitalists. The policy of U.S. imperialism aims to increase unemployment, scarcity, and poverty in West Germany, and to turn West Germany into a bridgehead for new wars. According to the plans of U.S. imperialists, West Germany must become a supply base for arsenals and cannon fodder. To this end, U.S. monopoly capitalists are hindering the work of purging Nazis and democratization in West Germany, and are sheltering chauvinism and neo-Nazism in the Western occupied zones. German imperialists and Ruhr coal mine owners are preparing to participate in the implementation of the U.S. military plan. This is why Adenauer signed the Occupation Statute. The West German people must resolutely oppose rearmament. The telegram from Marshal Stalin to the leaders of the German Democratic Republic has opened up the path of peaceful development for the German people. This is of great importance to the development of Germany and the whole of Europe. We must realize that our greatest task is to have our people participate in the democratic German National Front and the international peace-loving front."

    西德人民举行大会  抗议美帝武装西德
    雷曼演说号召参加全国阵线和国际和平阵线
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社柏林十日讯：西德人民在鲁尔省的杜塞尔多夫、埃森、多特蒙德等大城举行大会，抗议鲁尔法规，占领法规和西德再武装，保卫和平，并拥护德国的统一。与会者数万人。
    德意志通讯社报道：在杜塞尔多夫的大会上，德国（西德）共产党主席雷曼发表演说称：“占领法规分裂德国，夺去了西占区人民的自决权。鲁尔法规的实施，把西德重工业交给了美国独占资本家支配。鲁尔法规使得西德人民身受双重镣铐——德国煤业大王的镣铐和美国独占资本家的镣铐。美国帝国主义者的政策旨在增加西德的失业、匮乏和贫穷，并把西德变为新战争的桥头堡。按照美国帝国主义者的计划，西德必须成为兵工厂和炮灰的供给地。为此，美国独占资本家阻挠西德肃清纳粹和民主化的工作，并在西占区庇护沙文主义和新纳粹主义。德国帝国主义者、鲁尔区煤矿主准备参加美国军事计划的实施。这就是阿登纳在占领法规上签字的原因。西德人民必须坚决反对再武装。斯大林大元帅致德意志民主共和国领袖的电报，给德国人民打开了和平发展的道路。这对于德国和整个欧洲的发展都有巨大重要性。我们必须认识到：使我们的人民参加战斗的民主德国全国阵线和国际拥护和平阵线，是我们最大的任务”。
