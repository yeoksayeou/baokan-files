    Railway League Committee of the Lushun-Dalian Area
    Organizes Young Workers to Learn Technology
    Advocates Respect for Teachers and Love for Apprentices, Signs Master-Apprentice Contracts
    Over 1,500 Young Workers Have Been Upgraded in the Past Year
    [Report from this newspaper] The Railway League Committee of the Lushun-Dalian Area has achieved great success in organizing young League members and young workers to learn technology. In the past year, 1,524 young workers have been upgraded due to improved skills, adding new strength to the completion of production tasks. The successful experience of the Railway League Committee in organizing young workers to learn technology mainly consists of four points:
    
	A good master-apprentice relationship is the key to improving the skills of young workers.
    (1) Launch a campaign of respecting teachers and loving apprentices. This is one of the best ways to establish a correct master-apprentice relationship; and a good master-apprentice relationship is the main key to learning technology. First of all, conduct class education among workers, so that teachers understand that teaching apprentices well is glorious, and not teaching apprentices well is shameful, correcting the incorrect ideas of the old society such as "I would rather lend you ten yuan than pass on my skills," "If you teach an apprentice, the teacher will starve to death," and "An apprentice will not become a talent if he is not beaten"; among apprentices, it is necessary to correct the ideas of "I am here to be an apprentice, not to be your errand boy; now that the apprentices have turned over, why should I listen to you!" and educate them that only by learning technology well can they complete tasks and build a new China, which is glorious, otherwise it is shameful. At the same time, find good and bad typical examples among masters and apprentices for education. For example, Cui Changlin took three apprentices, and all of them were upgraded in just one month and three days; while apprentice Qin Guihe, who was taken by teacher Li Puyin, did not even learn to shake the handle after learning technology for three months. Another example is apprentice Du Xiliang, who respected his teacher and listened to his guidance, making sure to spread out a blanket for his teacher when he went to sleep after working the night shift, and pouring hot water for his teacher when he ate; the master also cared for his apprentice, and when he saw his apprentice sleeping without a quilt, he covered him with his large cotton coat. The master-apprentice relationship was very good. In three months, Du Xiliang learned four very difficult wash-bed skills, and in five months, he could watch three beds and also took two apprentices; while another apprentice did not obey the teacher's leadership, and he thought that "Now that we are liberated, you should teach me technology, otherwise I will criticize you at the meeting." Sometimes when the teacher was busy and asked him to find some water to drink, he said, "I am here to learn technology, not to set up a stage for you." In this way, the master and apprentice could not get along, and after learning for six months, he learned nothing. These examples illustrate the benefits and glory of respecting teachers and loving apprentices, giving everyone great educational significance.
    
	Learning while doing, teachers should let apprentices do it themselves.
    (2) Learning while doing. "Sharp eyes are not as good as skilled hands, and skilled hands are not as good as constant practice." This is a common saying among workers and is also one of the most effective ways to learn technology. Teachers should be patient when teaching apprentices, and should not be too hasty. They should explain to apprentices again and again, and teach them hand in hand, and carefully check the work done by apprentices. Teachers should boldly let apprentices do the work that they can do. Some teachers in the processing factory have adopted the following method in teaching apprentices: for example, if they should make two-fen workpieces, they first ask the apprentice to make one and a half fen, and the teacher will make the remaining half fen himself. This can give apprentices the opportunity to practice and ensure that the workpieces are not damaged. In addition, apprentices should be educated to establish an attitude of "being willing to ask questions without shame, being quick on their feet, diligent with their hands, and sharp with their eyes." For example, apprentice Lu Chaoyi adopted this method, and learned to wash tooth wheels, wash flat grooves, wash tenon grooves, and wash planes in only two months. In addition, teachers should pay special attention to constantly educating apprentices to pay attention to dangerous places in their work, because apprentices are generally easily "dizzy" when they first come to the factory and do not know which places to pay attention to for danger. According to statistics from the railway factory in August last year, there were eighteen workers injured due to carelessness at work, of which fifteen were newly arrived young workers, which was due to insufficient education from the leadership.
    
	While improving technology, technical theory must also be improved.
    (3) Improve the level of technical theory. It is not enough to train a skilled worker who only knows how to work; he must also be able to work with drawings and be able to calculate and draw, otherwise he will not be able to do new work. In this work, the League should proactively cooperate closely with the trade union, and use spare time to conduct technical theory education for workers (especially young workers) on the basis of the original night schools. The content of education is technical principles such as mathematics, reading drawings, and drawing drawings. The education method should be to learn what you do, and teach by category. The technical study classes of the rolling stock section night school initially adopted the method of giving large classes in two phases, teaching everything at once. Workers in Department B were not interested in what was taught in Department A, and students dozed off in class, and the teachers were not motivated either. In the third phase, the method was changed to teaching separately according to the nature of the work, which was very effective. Workers in each department were happy to attend classes and understood the simple principles of the technology in their department; they also learned basic arithmetic.
    
	When signing master-apprentice contracts, attention must be paid to choosing suitable teachers.
    (4) Signing master-apprentice contracts. This is an experience introduced by Soviet comrades, which is more effective than simply shouting for masters to teach apprentices. The method is that after the apprentice comes to the factory, the factory finds a good teacher, and a contract is signed and jointly signed. For example, if the apprentice makes progress in two or three months and passes the examination, the apprentice will be upgraded and the teacher will be rewarded; the bonus will increase according to the number of times the apprentice is upgraded. This can make teachers more concerned about the progress of apprentices. If one party does not properly perform the contract provisions, the other party may raise questions; if neither party performs the contract, the factory should promptly correct it. This method has proven to be effective, but attention must be paid to selecting the master. Newly upgraded fourth-grade workers are not skilled enough themselves and should not take apprentices; some old workers, although they have skills, do not understand the principles of technology and are not easy to teach apprentices well. Therefore, the leadership should pay special attention when selecting masters, which is the key to realizing the master-apprentice contract.
    In addition, some units do not follow the technical level and use appropriate and correct examination methods when upgrading young workers, but instead subjectively decide on promotion administratively, which hinders the improvement of young workers' skills. Some units are not serious enough in implementing master-apprentice contracts, and there is a phenomenon of tightening first and then loosening, which should be corrected in time.

    旅大区铁路团委
    组织青工学习技术
    提倡尊师爱徒签订师徒合同
    一年来一千五百余青工升级
    【本报讯】旅大区铁路团委在组织青年团员与青年工人学习技术上获得很大成绩，去年一年中，有一千五百二十四名青工因技术提高而升级，为完成生产任务增加了新的力量。铁路团委组织青工学习技术成功的经验，主要有四点：
    搞好师徒关系，是提高青工技术的关键。
    （一）展开尊师爱徒运动。这是树立正确师徒关系的好方法之一；而搞好师徒关系又是学习技术的主要关键。首先，在工人中进行阶级教育，使老师明了教好徒弟为光荣，教不好徒弟为耻辱，纠正旧社会里“宁可借你十块钱，不把艺来传”，“教会徒弟，饿死老师”以及“徒弟不打不成材”等不正确的想法；在徒弟中，要纠正“我是来学徒的，不是给你当小使的；现在徒弟翻身啦，听你那一套！”的思想，教育他们只有学好技术，才能完成任务，建设新中国，这是光荣的，反之就是耻辱。同时，并在师徒中找出好坏的典型例子来进行教育。如崔长林带了三个徒弟，仅一月零三天的工夫就全升了级；而老师李普银带的徒弟秦桂和学了三个月的技术连摇摇把也没学会。又如徒弟杜锡亮尊敬老师，听他的指导，打夜班后睡觉时先给老师铺好毯子，吃饭时给老师倒热水；师父也关心徒弟，看到徒弟睡着没盖被就把大棉袄给徒弟盖上，师徒关系搞得很好，三个月工夫，杜锡亮就学会四盘很难干的洗床子，五个月工夫，能看三盘床子，还带了两个徒弟；而另外一个徒弟不服从老师领导，他认为“现在解放了，你应当教我技术，不然在会上批评你”，有时老师忙，叫他找点水喝，他说：“我是来学技术的，不是来给你摆台的”，这样师徒合不来，学了六个月，什么也没学会。这些实例，说明尊师爱徒的好处和光荣，给大家教育意义很大。
            边作边学，老师要放手让徒弟去干。
    （二）边作边学。“眼精不如手精，手精不如常摆弄”，这是工人中一句家常话，也是学习技术最有效的一种办法。老师教徒弟要耐心，不要操之过急，要一遍、二遍、三遍的对徒弟讲，把着手教，对徒弟作活要细心检查。徒弟能干的活要大胆放手让徒弟干，加工厂有的老师在教徒弟中，曾采用这样的方法：如应当车二分的活，先叫徒弟车一分半，剩下的半分老师自己来车，这样可以给徒弟练习机会，也保证作出的活不致弄坏。另外要教育徒弟树立“好学不耻常问、腿快手勤眼要尖”的态度。如徒弟卢超义就是采取了这种办法，只有两个月就学会了洗牙轮、洗平面槽、洗梢子槽、洗平面等工作。另外，老师应特别注意经常教育徒弟注意工作中危险的地方，因为徒弟新上工厂，一般容易“昏头转向”，不知应注意那些地方有危险。据铁路工厂去年八月份统计，因工作不小心而受伤的工人有十八名，其中十五名是新来的青工，这是由于领导上教育不够所致。
            与提高技术同时，必须提高技术理论。
    （三）提高技术理论水平。培养一个技术工人，光会干活是不够的，必须还能够拿起图纸就可以作活，还要会计算，会画图，否则换了新活就不会干。在这一工作上，团应主动地密切与工会配合，利用业余时间在原有夜校的基础上进行工人（特别是青工）的技术理论教育。教育内容是数学、看图、画图等技术原理。教育方法应是干什么、学什么，分门别类的教。机务段夜校的技术学习班，开始两期采取上大课的方式，一揽子教；教甲部门的东西乙部门工人不感兴趣，学员上课打瞌睡，教的人也没劲。在第三期改变方法，按工作性质分开教，收效很大，各部门工人都高兴上课，懂得了本部门技术的简单原理；普通的算术也学会了。
            签订师徒合同，须注意选择合适的老师。
    （四）订师徒合同。这是苏联同志介绍的经验，比空喊师傅带徒弟更有效。其方式是徒弟来厂之后，由厂方给找好老师，订立合同，共同签字。如在两三个月内徒弟学得有成绩，经考试合格后，徒弟升级，老师得奖；奖金按徒弟升级的次数增加。这样可使老师更关心徒弟的进步。如有一方不好好履行合同规定，对方可提出质问；如双方都不履行合同时，厂方应及时纠正。这个方法证明是有效的，但必须注意选择师傅。新升级的四级工人，本身技术还不熟练，不宜带徒弟；一部分老工人，虽有技术，但不懂技术原理，也不容易带好徒弟。因而领导上在选择师傅时应特别注意，这是实现师徒合同的关键。
    此外，有个别单位在青工升级上，不按技术水平，用适宜的正确的考试方法；而由行政上主观地决定提升，因此妨碍了青工技术的提高。有的单位在贯彻师徒合同上不够认真，有先紧后松现象，这些均应及时注意纠正。
