    Thoroughly Implement Chairman Mao's Literary and Art Policies
    Beijing People's Art Theatre Established
    Vice Chairman Zhu Gives Personal Instructions

    [Beijing News] The Beijing People's Art Theatre held its inauguration ceremony on New Year's Day, 1950. Vice Chairman Zhu De, Vice Minister of Culture Zhou Yang, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Peng Zhen, and Minister of Propaganda Deng Tuo attended and gave instructions. Guests present included Xiao San, Ouyang Yuqian, Hong Shen, Zhang Geng, Lian Kuoru, and all comrades of the theatre. The ceremony began with an opening speech by the theatre's director, Li Bozhao, who explained that the establishment of the Beijing People's Art Theatre was to meet the needs of guiding the popularization of literature and art in Beijing and to build a new theatre art in the capital. She also mentioned that the predecessor of the People's Art Theatre, the People's Cultural Work Troupe, was reorganized from the Yan'an Central Party School, the Literary and Art Work Research Office, and the Central Philharmonic Orchestra to meet the needs of the war environment.

    Vice Chairman Zhu took the stage amidst warm applause. He first congratulated the comrades present on the New Year and then said: The task of the People's Art Theatre is to implement Chairman Mao's literary and art policies, which requires the comrades to have a spirit of serving the people and a high degree of interest in art to accomplish. He clearly instructed: First, there are many experts to guide you, and you must study hard. Second, it must be popularized, that is, worker-peasant-ized, which is the basis for improvement. You must study in many ways, from shallow to deep. If you don't know the most basic things in China, how can you improve? You must know how to find confidants among the people. In particular, the essence of Chinese national art should be absorbed and carried forward. Third, respect technically excellent talents, learn from each other, respect each other, and do not have only "my good" or flamboyant thoughts. By gathering artistic talents from all over the country and frequently connecting with the masses, the theatre can be done well. Finally, he said: Study while working; it is both a theatre and a school; there are both students and teachers, and results can be achieved in ten or eight years.

    Poet Xiao San encouraged everyone to adhere to the construction of new theatre art as a lifelong career.

    Deng Tuo, Minister of Propaganda of the Municipal Party Committee, affirmed the achievements of the theatre's predecessor, the People's Cultural Work Troupe, in his speech. He hoped that they would further connect with the masses extensively in the direction of literature and art indicated by Chairman Mao, create the art of the working people, and establish and consolidate this connection not only ideologically and technically, but also organizationally.

    Vice Minister Zhou Yang pointed out that the establishment of the People's Art Theatre, in its significance, is nothing more than placing the focus of its work on building a new theatre, but it should be noted that excessively high demands should not be made. Due to the country's financial difficulties, we cannot immediately catch up with the Moscow Art Theatre. There must be courage in creation, but do not deviate from reality, and put more effort into national forms.

    The People's Art Theatre should become the leading core of literary and artistic activities and creation for the people of the capital—especially the working class.
    Peng Zhen

    Peng Zhen arrived amidst his busy schedule and pointed out that the theatre should develop and lead the city's mass literary and artistic movement, for which it must have a creative spirit. The reason why Chairman Mao was able to lead the Chinese revolution was because he was a creative Marxist. In the creation of urban literature and art, the theme of large-scale industrial production must be expressed. Popularization is not lowering the level, not being vulgar. The People's Art Theatre must constantly improve itself and raise itself ideologically to the level required by the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, so as to guide the literary and artistic movement of workers, working people, and students, to popularize it to them, and only on the basis of this popularization can it improve itself. Artistic geniuses must also be found among the masses. Regarding the issue of organizing literary and artistic forces, he said: The People's Art Theatre should be the main force in the city's mass literary and artistic activities. Amateur art organizations in factories and schools are like "local armed forces," and various art lovers among the masses are like "militia." The main force should help guide the organization of local armed forces and militias; and rely on them and improve themselves from them. Finally, he talked about the issue of new and old, pointing out that new literature and art are the main and leading ones, so they should be developed. Old operas should be reformed mainly at present, and should be developed from the reform, from "weeding through the old to bring forth the new." At present, the main reform of old operas should be ideological reform, and this reform should be realized by relying on the progressive forces within the old literary and artistic workers. Finally, he concluded his speech with the words "The People's Art Theatre should become the leading core of literary and artistic activities and creation for the people of the capital—especially the working class." The venue resounded with warm and endless applause.

    In their speeches, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, on behalf of the Central Academy of Drama, expressed his willingness to cooperate with the People's Art Theatre to promote the construction of literature and art in the capital.

    Mr. Hong Shen expressed his willingness to do his best to help the theatre in all aspects, and hoped that the theatre could give him opportunities.

    Mr. Lian Kuoru also believed that the establishment of the theatre was a major event in the art world.

    Finally, Li Bo from the theatre delivered a reply on behalf of all the comrades of the theatre, thanking the leaders for their kindness, and expressing their willingness to work hard to implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies and to answer the earnest expectations of the leaders and guests with practical work.

    贯彻执行毛主席文艺方针
    京人民艺术剧院成立
    朱副主席亲临指示
    【北京讯】北京人民艺术剧院于一九五○年元旦举行成立典礼。朱副主席、文化部副部长周扬、中共北京市委书记彭真及市委宣传部长邓拓等亲临指示。到有来宾萧三、欧阳予倩、洪深、张庚、连阔如等及该院全体同志。首由院长李伯钊同志致开幕词，她说明北京人民艺术剧院的成立，是为了适应北京文艺普及工作要求指导的需要，和以建设首都新剧场艺术为目的。并提到人民艺术剧院的前身人民文工团是延安中央党校、文艺工作研究室及中央管弦乐团适应战争环境的需要而改编的。
    朱副主席在热烈的掌声中登台，他首先向在场的同志庆贺新年，然后说：人民艺术剧院的任务是要贯彻毛主席的文艺方针，这是需要靠同志们为人民服务的精神及对艺术的高度兴趣来完成的。他明确指示：第一、有许多专家来指导，你们要好好的学习。第二、要普遍化，就是工农化，这是提高的基础，要多方面的学习，要由浅入深。中国最浅的东西不知道，怎么提高呢？要懂得找人民的知音。尤其是中国的民族艺术，更应收取其精华，发扬光大。第三、要尊重技术上的优秀人材，互相学习，彼此尊重，不要只有“我的好”，风头主义的思想，收集全国艺术人材，经常联系群众，剧院就可以搞好了。最后他说：一面学习，一面工作；既是剧院，又是学校；有学生，又有老师，十年八年是可以搞出成绩来的。
    诗人萧三同志鼓励大家，坚持新剧场艺术建设，作为终身事业，搞一辈子。
    中共市委宣传部长邓拓同志在讲话中，肯定了该院前身人民文工团的成绩，希望更进一步在毛主席所指示的文艺方向上广泛连系群众，创造劳动人民的艺术，不但是在思想上、技术上，而且要在组织上建立与巩固这种联系。
    周扬副部长指出：人民艺术剧院的成立，就其意义说不外是将业务的重点放在建立新的剧场上，但要注意，不应要求过高，由于国家财政的困难，我们不可能马上跟莫斯科艺术剧院看齐。创作上要有勇气，但不要脱离现实，要在民族形式上多下功夫。
    人民艺术剧院应该成为首都人民大众——尤其工人群众的文艺活动和创造的领导核心                                                            
    彭真
    彭真同志于百忙中赶来，指出：该院要发展和领导本市人民大众的文艺运动，为此它就必须有创造精神。毛主席之所以能领导中国革命，就因为他是创造的马克思主义者。在城市文艺的创造中，要表现大规模的工业生产的主题。普及不是降低水平，不是庸俗。人民艺术剧院要不断提高自己，把自己在思想上提高到人民政协共同纲领要求的水平，以此来指导工人、劳动人民和学生的文艺运动，向他们去普及，并在这种普及的基础上，也只有在这种普及的基础上来提高自己。艺术的天才也必须到群众中去寻找。关于组织文艺力量的问题，他说：人民艺术剧院应是本市人民大众文艺活动的主力，工厂学校的业余艺术组织好比“地方武装”，人民大众中各种艺术爱好者好比是“民兵”。主力要帮助指导组织地方武装及民兵；并依靠他们和从他们那里来提高自己。最后他谈到新与旧的问题，指出新文艺是主要的、是领导的，因此要发展它。旧的戏曲，目前主要是改造，应从改造中，从“推陈出新”中来发展。关于改造旧戏曲目前主要应是思想的改造，并依靠旧文艺工作者内部的进步力量来实现此改造。末了，他以“人民艺术剧院应该成为首都人民大众——尤其工人群众的文艺活动和创造的领导核心”一语，结束了他的讲话。会场响起了热烈不息的掌声。
    来宾致词中，欧阳予倩先生代表中央戏剧学院，表示愿与人民艺术剧院配合，搞好首都的文艺建设。
    洪深先生表示尽大力对该院各方面帮助，希望该院能给以机会。
    连阔如先生也认为该院的成立，是艺术界的大事。
    大会最后由该院李波同志致答词，代表该院全体同志对各位首长致谢意，并愿意努力实现毛主席的文艺方针，以实际的工作来回答各位首长及来宾的殷切期望。
