Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 5th - The four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan in the Central South region have decided to universally launch a large-scale dyke and dam construction movement during the winter and spring seasons. Construction has already begun in some areas. The Engineering Department of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission organized a Yellow River inspection team in early December, consisting of personnel from Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces, to conduct on-site surveys of river works in various locations to formulate a plan for harnessing the Yellow River. The Henan section of the commission immediately mobilized the masses to repair dykes and plant willow trees along the riverbanks to reinforce the defenses. In order to accelerate flood control and river management projects, the Henan Provincial Government decided to allocate 19 million jin of grain, combining production with disaster relief, and implement a work-for-food program. Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces have respectively convened water conservancy conferences, deciding that the main task of current water conservancy work is to construct the main dykes of the Yangtze River and the dykes of its tributaries, as well as various large and small lakes. The surveying and statistical work of dyke projects in various parts of Hubei Province was completed in early December. Currently, dyke construction has commenced in areas such as Mianyang, Qianjiang, Tianmen, and Jundebao in Hanchuan. Xin'dizhen in Mianyang has also opened the Honghu dyke sluice gate to divert accumulated water into the Yangtze River in order to facilitate dyke repair and winter plowing. In Jiangxi Province, the project of blocking breaches and reinforcing embankments in the whole province has started in eleven counties and cities, including Jiujiang, Nanchang, Wan'an, and Taihe. The largest of these, the Nanchang Fudayou embankment project, employs over 2,000 workers daily. According to surveys, the total length of embankments in the province is approximately 30 kilometers, requiring over 9 million labor days. The provincial government has now determined the policy of "mobilizing the people of the whole province and adopting a public-private partnership" approach. At the same time, over 90 water conservancy technicians have been selected and dispatched to various locations to assist in dyke repair. It is estimated that after the project is completed next spring, over one million mu of farmland will be protected from flooding. Hunan Province has first started work in eleven counties around Dongting Lake. The Changde and Yiyang special districts have established a dyke repair and defense committee to strengthen the leadership of dyke construction projects. Yueyang County has mobilized disaster victims to participate in dyke repair, unified the collection of grain for relief, and combined dyke repair with disaster relief.

    豫省府拨粮一千九百万斤，实行以工代赈。
    【新华社汉口五日电】华中南区豫、鄂、赣、湘四省决定于冬春两季普遍展开大规模的修堤筑坝运动，有些地区已动工修筑。黄河水利委员会工程处、在十二月初旬即组织了豫、平（原）、鲁三省黄河考察组，赴各地勘察河工情况，以拟订治黄计划；该会河南段修防处，随即发动群众修堤及在沿河堤岸遍植柳树，以巩固堤防。河南省府为了加紧进行防洪治河工程，决定拨粮一千九百万斤，结合生产救灾，实行以工代赈。湖北、江西、湖南等省已分别召开水利会议，决定当前水利工作的主要任务为兴修长江干堤及各支流和各大小湖泊之堤圩等工程。湖北省各地堤工测量统计工作，已于十二月初全部完成。现沔阳、潜江、天门、汉川俊德堡等地已开工修堤，沔阳之新堤镇并开放洪湖堤闸，使积水导入长江，以便修堤及冬耕。江西全省之堵决口、培修圩堤工程，已有九江、南昌、万安、泰和等十一个县市开始全部动工，其中最大的南昌富大有圩工程，每日上工者达二千余人。据调查，全省圩堤工程约为三十公里，需人工九百余万工。现省府已确定“发动全省人民，采取民办公助”的方针。同时并选派九十余名水利技术人员，分赴各地帮助修堤。预计明春工程完成后，可使百余万亩农田免受水灾。湖南省已首先在洞庭湖周围之十一个县开工。常德、益阳等专署为了加强修堤工程的领导，特成立堤务修防委员会。岳阳县在修堤中发动灾民参加，统一筹粮代赈，使修堤与救灾结合起来。
