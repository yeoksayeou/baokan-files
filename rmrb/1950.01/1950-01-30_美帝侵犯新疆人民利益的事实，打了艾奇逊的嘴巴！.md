Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Chairman, Bao Erhan

The big liar of American imperialism, Acheson, fabricated an absurd and shameless lie on January 12th at the National Press Club in Washington. In his fairy-tale-like speech on "American Policy in Asia," Acheson touched upon Xinjiang Province in northwestern China. He maliciously said, "In Xinjiang, Soviet agents must be sending very pleasant reports to Moscow." This rant is simply a great insult to our great friendly nation, the Soviet Union, and all the Chinese people, especially the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang! Where justice lies, silence is not an option. I, on behalf of the 5.3 million people of Xinjiang, have the following statement:

We Chinese people, in order to strive for independence, liberation, democracy, and unity, have fought heroically and continuously for a hundred years. Today, we have shattered the shackles of imperialism, eliminated the reactionary regime of the Kuomintang, victoriously grasped our own destiny, and established the People's Republic of China. Under the shining light of the glorious victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary cause, and in the face of the irretrievable defeat of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the massive military aid and billions of U.S. dollars of investment by U.S. imperialism to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits not only yielded no profit but also resulted in a complete loss of capital. Mr. Acheson, under this severe blow of "trying to steal a chicken only to lose the rice," became enraged and started spouting nonsense, fabricating a monstrous lie that the Soviet Union "invaded" Xinjiang. This is something that even a three-foot-tall child in China would scoff at and shake their head in disbelief. Before the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, Mr. Acheson, to borrow your words, in Xinjiang, the agents of U.S. imperialism must have been sending very unpleasant reports to Washington! Remember that after Paxton, the former U.S. consul in Dihua and a great conspirator, left Dihua, only the vice consul Mark Nam (Michael) remained in the U.S. consulate. On the eve of Xinjiang's peaceful liberation, he left silently and without saying goodbye. A diplomat arbitrarily comes and goes without informing the relevant authorities of the place where he is stationed. What contempt this is for Chinese sovereignty! After Mark Nam ran to the mountains near Fuyuan County in Xinjiang, he abandoned his car and reached the notorious Kuomintang reactionary dog and bandit Usman. On September 29th, he went to see Jani Mukhan, the former Director of Finance who had fled and defected under his counter-propaganda, instigating them to flee together to the Zhenxi County area. Mark Nam himself carried two radio stations, contacting Kuomintang agents at any time to transmit information. He said to the bandit leaders Usman, Jani Mukhan, and the 94 White Russians who escorted Usman: "Do not obey the provincial government. We will help you oppose them. The Third World War is about to break out. You can maintain your armed forces and prepare for action!" This was said by the Hamin people and naturalized people who fled back from Zhenxi. This is the ironclad fact that the vice consul openly interfered in China's internal affairs and undermined China's unity. He lived with bandits Usman and Jani Mukhan for more than 20 days. Before leaving, he gave 25 taels of gold to the 94 White Russians who were Usman's accomplices as capital for their rebellion. He obtained 14 horses from Usman, and Usman sent people to escort him to Tibet. Since then, the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy activities in Xinjiang have suffered a painful defeat.

The people of Xinjiang have now joined hands with the 475 million people of the whole country like brothers, and are working hard to build a new democratic China. Perhaps Mr. Acheson thinks that Xinjiang's being like this means that it has fallen into the hands of the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union has never committed any events that disrespect Chinese sovereignty or harm the interests of the Chinese people. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang deeply understand that in the course of the past 32 years, the Soviet Union has not only not invaded the territory of other countries or an inch of land in Xinjiang, has not only not harmed the interests of other countries' people, but has also absolutely respected the sovereignty of other countries' people, and has shown deep sympathy and friendship for the oppressed nations in their struggle for independence and liberation. We, the people of Xinjiang, deeply understand that in the Second World War, the Soviet Union rescued all peace-loving people in the world from the sea of blood of fascist slaughter, so we believe that the Soviet Union is the most reliable force for safeguarding world human peace and our most sincere friendly nation.

Today, I represent the 14 ethnic groups and 5.3 million people of Xinjiang to declare: Xinjiang will always be an inseparable territory of the People's Republic of China. The people of all ethnic groups in our province are determined to unite with the people of the whole country like brothers and like iron, and under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the great and wise leader Chairman Mao Zedong, we will strive to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong People's Republic of China.

### 美帝侵犯新疆人民利益的事实，打了艾奇逊的嘴巴！

    美帝侵犯新疆人民利益的事实，打了艾奇逊的嘴巴！
    新疆省人民政府主席  鲍尔汉
    美帝国主义的大谎言家艾奇逊，一月十二日在华盛顿美国全国新闻俱乐部捏造了一个荒谬无耻的谎言。艾奇逊在他那篇童话似的“美国的亚洲政策”的演讲中，涉及中国西北的新疆省。他恶毒的说“在新疆，苏联的代理人一定有很愉快的报告送到莫斯科。”这种狂吠，简直是对我们伟大的友邦苏联及全中国人民特别是新疆各族人民莫大的污辱！正义所在，不容缄默，我代表新疆五百三十万人民有以下的声明：
    我们中国人民，为了争取独立，解放，民主，统一，百年来曾经前仆后继、英勇奋斗，今天已经打碎了帝国主义的枷锁，消灭了国民党的反动政权，自己胜利的掌握了自己的命运，建立了中华人民共和国。在中国人民革命事业辉煌胜利的照耀下，在国民党反动派无可挽回的惨败情况下，美帝国主义对于蒋匪大量军火和数十亿美元的投资，不但无利可图，而且连本赔光。艾奇逊先生，在这种“偷鸡不成蚀把米”的严重打击下，恼羞成怒，大放厥词，造出污蔑苏联“侵略”新疆的弥天大谎。这是中国三尺之童都会嗤之以鼻而摇头不信的。在新疆和平解放前，艾奇逊先生，仿照你的话说：在新疆，美帝国主义的代理人一定有很不愉快的报告送到华盛顿了吧！记得在当时美帝国主义前驻迪化领事大阴谋家派克斯顿离开了迪化之后，美领馆仅剩下副领事马克南（买克尔）一人，他在新疆和平解放的前夕，就不声不响的出走了。一个使节，不关照驻在地的有关机关而任意来去，这对中国主权是何等轻视。马克南跑到新疆的孚远县附近山中之后，把自己坐的小汽车抛开，而到达著名的国民党反动派走狗土匪乌斯满处；并于九月二十九日又到因受他的反宣传而逃走叛变的前财政厅长贾尼木汗处，煽惑他们共同跑到镇西县一带。马克南自己带有无线电台两部，随时与国民党特务联络，传递消息。他曾对匪首乌斯满、贾尼木汗以及随着他们出走的少数哈族和给乌斯满保镖的九十四个白俄说：“你们不要服从省府，我们帮助你们反对他们，第三次世界大战就要爆发了，你们可以保持武装，准备动作！”这是由镇西那里逃回的哈民及归化民所说的。这就是该副领事公开干涉中国内政和破坏中国统一的铁的事实。他与乌、贾等匪共住二十余日，临行又给乌匪的帮凶白俄等九十四名以黄金二十五两，作为他们叛乱的资本，他从乌斯满那里得到马十四匹，并由乌匪派人把他送到西藏去了。从此，美帝国主义在新疆的阴谋活动是遭到了惨痛的失败。
    新疆人民现已和全国四万万七千五百万人民兄弟般的携起手来，正为建设新民主主义的新中国而努力。大概艾奇逊先生以为新疆这样就算是落在苏联的手中去了吧。
    苏联从未发生过不尊重中国主权和危害中国人民利益的事件。我们新疆各族人民深刻地了解苏联在三十二年的过程中，不但没有侵略他国的领土和新疆的一寸土地，不但没有危害他国人民的利益，而且绝对尊重他国人民的主权，对于被压迫民族争取独立解放更予以深切的同情与友谊。我们新疆人民深刻地明白在世界第二次大战中，苏联把全世界和平人类，从法西斯屠杀的血海中拯救出来，所以我们认为苏联是保卫世界人类和平最可靠的力量和我们最真挚的友邦。
    今天我代表新疆十四个民族，五百三十万人民宣告：我们新疆永远是中华人民共和国不可分离的领土。我们全省各族人民坚决地与全国人民兄弟般而又钢铁般地团结起来，在中央人民政府和伟大贤明的领袖毛泽东主席领导之下，为建设独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的中华人民共和国而努力。
