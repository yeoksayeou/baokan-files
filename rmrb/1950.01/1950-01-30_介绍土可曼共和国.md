Introducing the Turkmen Republic

The Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic is one of the sixteen republics of the Soviet Union. Located in Central Asia, it is bordered by the Caspian Sea to the west, the Amu Darya River to the east, the Kopet Dag Mountains extending from north to south, and Iran and Afghanistan to the south. Within its borders lies the Kara-Kum Desert, with temperatures reaching 160 degrees. It covers an area of 485,000 square kilometers and has a population of 1.3 million.

Before the October Revolution, Turkmenistan was a colony of Tsarist Russia. Mineral deposits were undiscovered and undeveloped, and agriculture was extremely backward. Ninety percent of the land belonged to chieftains and Russian landlord colonists. In terms of cultural level, only seven out of every thousand people were literate.

After the establishment of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic in 1924, Turkmenistan's face was completely renewed. With the implementation of Stalin's Five-Year Plans, the mining of oil, sulfur, sulfates, coal, lead, and other minerals was equipped with the most modern machinery. Light industries such as chemicals, glass, and food have also greatly developed, so that industrial products accounted for 70% of the republic's total production. Women account for 30% of the labor force, including many engineers, technicians, and foremen. 100,000 small farmers have joined collective farms, with 4,000 tractors, combines, and other agricultural machines. Compared with 1913, the cultivated land has doubled, and the grain output has tripled. The republic's main agricultural product, cotton, has increased from 0.71 tons per hectare to 1.64 tons. From 1932 to 1938, the income of collective farmers increased eightfold.

With the rapid growth of the national economy, the people's cultural level has also significantly improved. The Republic now has 1,000 schools with 177,000 students. The 29 specialized schools have 6,000 students. In 1940, the Turkmen branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences was established. Among the 65 newspapers in the country, 57 are published in Turkmen (before the revolution, there were only three Russian newspapers), with a circulation of 200,000 copies. By 1941, there were 257 hospitals in the country, with 2,580 medical workers.

The new Five-Year Plan for 1946-50 laid a more solid foundation for Turkmenistan to restore and develop the national economy and improve the material and cultural life of the people. During the five years, it is planned to invest 1.6 billion rubles. By this year, oil production will increase to 1.1 million tons, coal to 60,000 tons, phosphate to 50,000 tons, and sulfur ore production will increase tenfold. Cotton fields will increase by 145,000 mu in five years. The Kara-Kum Canal, which can increase the country's fertile land by more than 220,000 mu, will be completed.

    介绍土可曼共和国
    土可曼苏维埃社会主义共和国，是苏联十六个加盟共和国之一。在中央亚细亚，西边是里海、东边是阿拉姆河，从北到南延伸着考伯特—达格山脉，南边与伊朗及阿富汁接壤。境内有热至一六○度的大沙漠—喀拉·库姆。面积四十八万五千方公里，人口一百三十万人。
    在十月革命以前，土可曼是一个沙皇俄国殖民地，矿藏未发现也未开发，农业异常落后，百分之九十的土地是酋长的和俄罗斯地主殖民者的，就文化水平说，每一千人中，只有七个人识字。
    一九二四年土可曼苏罗埃社会主义共和国成立后，土可曼的面貌从此一新。斯大林五年计划执行了，开采石油、硫磺矿、硫酸盐、煤、铅等矿业皆具有最现代化的机器。轻工业如化学、玻璃、食品等也有大大发展，使共和国的全部生产中工业产品占了百分之七十。在劳动人民中妇女占百分之三十，其中很多工程师、技师及领班。十万小农已参加了集体农场，有四千架拖拉机、联合机及其他农业机器。和一九一三年比较，耕地增加了两倍，食粮产量增加了三倍。共和国主要的农产物——棉花，每海克脱产量从零点七一吨增加到一点六四吨。从一九三二年到一九三八年，集体农民的收入增加了八倍。
    随着国民经济的迅速增长，人民文化水平也显著提高了。共和国现有一千所学校，在学人数达十七万七千名。二十九所专科学校中学生六千名。一九四○年土可曼并成立了苏联科学院分院。全国六十五种报纸中用土可曼文出版的计五十七种。（革命前只有三家俄文报纸），销路二十万份。至一九四一年国内已有二五七家医院，医务工作者达二五八○人。
    一九四六——五○年的新五年计划，为土可曼恢复与发展国民经济及提高人民物质及文化生活，布置了更坚实的基础，五年中计划投资十六亿卢布。到今年，石油产量将增至一百一十万吨，煤炭六万吨，磷酸盐类五万吨，硫磺矿产增加十倍。棉田在五年之中将增加十四万五千亩。能为国家增加二十二万余亩肥田的大喀拉库姆运河将建筑完成。
