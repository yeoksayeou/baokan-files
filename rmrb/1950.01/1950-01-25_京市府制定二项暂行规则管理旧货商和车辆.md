            Provisional Regulations for the Management of Second-Hand Dealers
    [Beijing News] In order to strengthen the management of second-hand dealers in this city, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has specially formulated the "Beijing Provisional Regulations for the Management of Second-Hand Dealers." The implementation of these regulations will ensure the legitimate operation of second-hand dealers and help consolidate public security in the city. All those engaged in consignment shops, auction houses, consignment sales, used clothing, antiques, used clocks and watches, and other second-hand businesses within the city that require management, shall be managed by the Public Security Bureau in accordance with these regulations, unless otherwise stipulated by laws and regulations. The regulations stipulate that second-hand dealers should fill out an application form before opening their business and submit it to the local Public Security Sub-bureau, which will forward it to the Public Security Bureau for approval and issuance of a special business license. They must also report to the Bureau of Commerce for approval before commencing business. Second-hand dealers already in business before the promulgation of these regulations should complete registration procedures within one month after the promulgation of the regulations. The regulations stipulate that second-hand dealers shall not purchase or consign military supplies not formally auctioned by military and government agencies, as well as other dangerous goods, items banned by order, and items of unknown origin. Second-hand dealers shall also keep records, detailing the name, quantity, and price of the goods purchased each day, as well as the name and address of the seller or consignor. The records must be accurate and complete, without any concealment or omission, and a report shall be submitted to the local Public Security Sub-bureau every ten days. Articles 7 to 11 of the regulations stipulate the specific obligations of second-hand dealers to assist the Public Security Bureau in investigating stolen goods, and stipulate that if a case is solved as a result of such assistance, the Public Security Bureau may give spiritual or material rewards depending on the circumstances. After the promulgation of these regulations, effective immediately, any second-hand dealer who violates these regulations will be punished by the Public Security Bureau according to the severity of the circumstances. In serious cases, their business license will be revoked, and those involving criminal offenses will be transferred to the court for handling.
