Introducing "Labor Heroism in Soviet Enterprises"
	颖奋 (Yǐng Fèn)
"Labor Heroism in Soviet Enterprises" is an excellent book, written by Sur. It is a vivid portrait of Soviet men and women workers, engineers, manufacturers, scientists, and all Stakhanovite workers.

The book tells us how the outstanding sons and daughters of the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, struggled selflessly and worked heroically to build and defend their motherland. The first section, "The Emerging Nation," describes the following situation: In the era of Tsarist Russia, nine-tenths of the country, which accounted for one-sixth of the global landmass, was completely undeveloped wilderness. The Far East and Siberia were regarded as "remote and desolate" provinces, and the far northern fringes remained uninhabited like the era of great floods, a border area where "birds and animals were not surprised." Although nature generously endowed Russia with various treasures, because political power was in the hands of landlords and nobles who only knew how to pursue personal interests and completely disregarded industrial development, even the pig iron, coal, razors, needles, and buttons used in Russia at that time had to be imported from foreign countries. After the victory of the October Revolution, the state political system underwent a fundamental change, and based on the wise plans of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet Union has been transformed into the world's powerful and invincible first-class industrial country it is today. When the Soviet Union was implementing its first Five-Year Plan, the British writer H.G. Wells wrote: "Could there be a bolder plan than this, on vast plains covered with forests, ignorant peasants, minimal technological development and a depressed industrial and commercial sector?" Especially when Lenin announced the famous national plan for the electrification of Russia, he sarcastically wrote: "Only those with a great deal of imagination would fantasize about implementing electrification in Russia! As for me personally, I cannot imagine it at all..." He even "boldly" speculated that this would happen tens of thousands of years later. Furthermore, publications in various imperialist countries also mocked in this way: "The Bolsheviks are attempting to achieve in a few years what would require fifty years to complete under favorable conditions, conditions that even the Bolsheviks themselves admit do not exist." However, during the second Five-Year Plan, these enemies of the Soviet state no longer held a mocking attitude, because they understood that the Bolsheviks were true to their word. Before the revolution, Russia ranked fifth in the world in terms of industrial scale, but after these two Five-Year Plans, it already ranked second, second only to the United States. When the third Five-Year Plan began in 1938, the Soviet Union had already surpassed the major capitalist countries in terms of production technology and the speed of industrial development. By the last year before the war (1940), the Soviet Union's industrial output had increased twelvefold compared to the 1913 level, and the industrial products produced by the country in twenty-nine days were equal to the products of the entire year in the Tsarist era! It was the Lenin and Stalin style speed that shortened the time limit, completing a year's work in a month. The implementation of these wise plans, and the successive plans that continued to be implemented, enabled it not only to resist Hitler's military aggression but also to crush it. In 1941, when the German invaders perfidiously attacked the Soviet Union, the output of the Soviet machine manufacturing industry had exceeded the old level by more than fifty times. During these years, along with the occurrence of these great miracles, a large number of "new people" emerged across the country. In the spring of 1919, the Soviet Republic was at a critical juncture; enemies threatened the Soviet Union from all sides, coupled with widespread famine. At that time, workers could only receive fifty grams of bread per day, and it was mixed with bran. In such difficult days, the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party called on all the people to work with a revolutionary spirit, and the workers responded to the Party's call with labor heroism. In May of that year, the Bolsheviks on the Moscow-Kazan road decided to work one hour more each day and work six hours more after completing their work on Saturdays, until the counter-revolutionary Cossack army was completely defeated. Their resolution stated:
	"We Communists, in order to win the victory of the revolution, should not spare our health and lives, and should do this work without pay."
	This glorious action quickly resonated among the workers in enterprises across the country. They understood that the victory of the Red Army, the fate of the revolution, and the life of the Republic all depended on their labor. People who were often hungry, exhausted, and weary were happy to voluntarily dedicate their last strength to seek happiness for the motherland without remuneration. Lenin wrote of this labor feat at the time:
	"Isn't this the greatest heroism?"
Lenin called these Saturdays "Great Beginnings," believing they represented the beginning of a new, communist attitude towards labor. He also wrote:
	"Wherever ordinary workers selflessly strive to increase labor productivity, that is where communism begins." (《Complete Works of Lenin》, Vol. 24, p. 342)
The first massive construction of socialist industry—the Stalingrad Tractor Factory—was completed in June 1930. At the time, it also provoked scornful sarcasm in foreign countries: "Humph! The Bolsheviks have built a very large factory, even bigger than anything in the United States. But, in any case, they won't be able to use it themselves, they'll still have to ask our people for help!" Indeed, when thousands of Soviet men and women first came to the factory to learn to work on the sophisticated lathes brought from overseas, it was difficult, and very difficult. Even the skilled workers at the time felt their abilities were insufficient and the machines didn't obey them. However, these resolute, outstanding Soviet sons and daughters were determined to study the intricate and complex science of these constantly flowing mass production machines step by step! To learn new technologies that had never been seen before in the work! To win precious time and learn the experience accumulated by the United States in decades in just a few months. On the night of August 30, 1935, a globally shocking event occurred at the "Central Irmino" mine, resulting in the greatest victory of socialist labor. That is: the outstanding coal miner Stakhanov, by implementing coal mining division of labor and extending the coal pit, mined 102 tons in less than six hours. Two days later, Stakhanov mined 227 tons in a six-hour work shift, an unprecedented social record! His great victory spread like lightning across the Soviet Union! In September of the same year, the young production team leader Busigin in the blacksmith shop of the Molotov Automobile Factory in Gorky City, thought every day: Why can workers in the American Ford factory produce more than one hundred connecting rods in one hour, while our Soviet blacksmiths, with the best machine equipment, can't even complete their small work quota of ninety-six connecting rods? However, this young captain studied the scientific division of labor, launched the "struggle for every precious second," and transformed the foot pedal machine. Originally, it often took thirty hammer blows to successfully make a connecting rod, but with this transformation, it only took fifteen or ten hammer blows to make one; and all the workers in the factory were unwilling to lag behind their captain, so everyone could produce one hundred twenty-seven, one hundred thirty-six, or one hundred sixty-three in one hour. By 1937, the worker Bovyrigin could even make five connecting rods in one minute. Because of this, in 1936, it took four hundred seventy-eight hours of labor (nearly twenty days and nights) to build one "M-1" car in the Soviet Union, but by the anniversary of the Stakhanov movement in 1940, it only took one hundred eighty-nine hours. The time it used to take to make two cars now made more than five. As a result of saving a few seconds, the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands more cars in one year, leaving the Ford factory's productivity far behind. In February 1935, the gear scraping machine worker Gudov learned to work independently in just six months, and also made inventions on this gear scraping machine, increasing the lathe's productivity by fourteen times. By 1937, Gudov actually broke the world record. It used to take one and a half hours to make a part, and it had to go through five separate procedures, but Gudov made two hundred thirty-eight parts in three minutes and fifty-eight seconds, exceeding the original quota by ninety percent! The work of one and a half hours was completed by him in one minute! At the same time, a part-time movement was also launched among the workers in the Soviet Union, managing multiple different lathes simultaneously. Many workers were as familiar with the adjacent lathes as they were with their own. In a factory in Moscow, two Stakhanovite workers switched from managing eight semi-automatic gear scraping lathes to managing sixteen lathes, then to managing eighteen, and gradually increased to managing thirty lathes! As for artisans who were proficient in two, three, or even four specialized skills at the same time, there were many.

In the "Transitioning to Wartime Standards" section, the heroic style and spirit of Soviet female workers are specifically depicted. Look at the following letter from a female worker in a Moscow factory to her relatives and friends who were drafted into the army, which vividly and affectionately expresses their great determination and infinite loyalty to their motherland!
	"You go to the front lines, and we stay in the rear, but for us, there is no distinction between front and rear. We will do everything in our power and use all our energy to replace your work, guaranteeing you all necessities. If necessary, we will work day and night, and if necessary, we will take up arms to help you. Please rest assured, don't worry about us, we understand our responsibility to the motherland, and we will definitely consolidate your military achievements with Stakhanovite labor." When the Patriotic War began, tens of thousands of Soviet women went to factories, mines, and pits to replace the glorious labor positions of their fathers, brothers, sons, and husbands who went to the front lines. Some women were very happy to write to their husbands on the front lines:
	"I have learned to work on your lathe, and I am very honored. At this moment, I solemnly swear to you: I will definitely be a companion who does not tarnish your honor! You accurately shoot and kill the German invaders, and I will complete production well."
In the past, only men were employed as machinists and turret lathe operators in many factories in the Soviet Union; but now, almost all of these workshops are women. Female coal miners and female workers in blacksmith shops all have the full authority to proudly say: "Women can take on any job and are no worse than men." Whenever necessary, many female clerks, statisticians, accountants, financial officers, planners, and accountants resolutely learn new jobs.

The section "Complete It Immediately When the Front Requires It" depicts how engineers, manufacturers, and craftsmen in major Soviet factories carried forward the "combination of labor and science" and demonstrated great and admirable genius. A factory that manufactures instruments can produce simple, lightweight, and easy-to-use Degtyarev submachine guns; a factory that manufactures textile machinery can be transformed into a factory that manufactures mortars; a factory that manufactures fine wooden articles also manufactures landmines for the front; a small repair shop can also manufacture bombs; the workers in a soda factory even used explosives instead of sweet lemonade to fill bottles for the soldiers to destroy enemy tanks. Because wartime speed does not allow for long periods of thinking - it is necessary to quickly find the best way, so the close cooperation between manufacturers, craftsmen, and metallurgists in various factories was born and consolidated as a result. To construct new cannons and produce anti-tank guns, all staff members worked tirelessly, without leaving the factory for five consecutive days and nights; these new weapons were quickly subjected to rigorous and flawless testing on the battlefield, and the fascist bandit tank crews personally felt its extremely strong armor-piercing power.

The heroic Soviet labor heroism and the raging revolutionary competition are written in the two sections "Powerful Driving Force" and "Producing More Metal." During the competition on the eve of the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the following slogans were posted in the workshops of the Gorky Automobile Factory:
	"This workshop has formed a front-line production team of Youth League members!"
	"Front-line production team members are responsible for completing at least two production quotas every day and will never leave the lathe until the task is completed!"
	"Everyone learns from the front-line soldiers!"
These Youth League members worked selflessly, completing 230% of the task in one day. A few days later, front-line teams composed of girls also appeared in other workshops. After three or four months, this kind of front-line production team appeared in agriculture, transportation, and construction throughout the Gorky province. The slogan of these production team members was: "In the cause of heroic labor, do not lag behind the Red Army soldiers." They all regarded the interests of the front lines as their lives.

Let's look at the heroic labor and enthusiastic competition of the Soviet workers! Every time the steelmaking was accelerated and increased in the furnace of Kuznetsk's iron smelter Malyshev, it could be used to manufacture a thousand shells. Every fraction of a point he saved meant the production of ten more shells! Ural factory workers Valeyev and Sidorovsky not only shortened the iron smelting time to five hours but were able to produce seventeen tons of steel per square meter. The furnace workshop artisans Durukhanov and Zhernin, who won the Red Banner, were awarded the Lenin Medal and other glorious awards for overcoming difficulties and shortening time. During the days of severe wartime testing, Altai worker Haikin proposed a competition with the drilling workers of the Kazakh Republic, and this call met with enthusiastic sympathy. When Haikin completed twenty-three quotas in one shift on January 15, he was surpassed two days later by Khugakov, a worker in the neighboring Sokolnaya mine, who completed thirty-four quotas in one shift; but two weeks later, the Soviet Information Bureau announced Haikin's new victory - completing 3,662 percent of the production quota. However, in February, the fierce competition between Dobrodeev of the Leninogorsk mine and Deminchuk of the Sokolnaya mine resulted in Deminchuk completing 5,470 percent of the task in one shift! He completed one hour's production quota in one minute, and his shift mined 1,400 tons of ore, an amount that could fill a train of one hundred cars! In this case, Bausse, who managed the lathe, was also able to manufacture a complex part on three lathes and complete more than twenty quotas. The technical inspector did not find a single defect or imperfect part in the twenty batches of parts he manufactured, all of which were accurate to the slightest detail. He said: "The so-called new record is just the first step on a new road." 1,274,836 staff members from Ural enterprises signed a letter to Stalin saying:
	"The amazing power of socialist competition is unparalleled in the world. What seemed impossible yesterday is now possible for millions of people. The labor army has been tempered in the flames of competition. In the factory workshops and on the fields of collective farms, such heroes are multiplying day by day."

The section "Runin-style Workers" is dedicated to the miracles of Soviet railway workers and locomotive drivers. In order to supply the front lines, the workers ensured that the trains departed on time without wasting a minute, risking their lives to drill into the red-hot fire chamber, repairing severely damaged train equipment that would have taken several hours to fix in just ten minutes, so that the train could depart on time. Train driver Runin said: "Every soldier can not only shoot but also load and unload the rifles and machine guns they use. We railway workers should also be like this, the locomotive is our weapon." He also said: "It is easier to prevent problems than to treat them later." His production team carefully looked after their locomotives, wiping and scrubbing them, and carefully inspecting the machines before starting them. Therefore, his locomotive not only had a fast speed, but every time the boiler was cleaned, others often accumulated fifty, sixty, or even seventy different damages, while Runin's repair book recorded no more than five or six at most.

The socialist state of the Soviet Union, the great pillar of world peace, will be forever invincible. The Soviet workers have set a brilliant example for us! Today, our great People's Republic of China has been born, and our working class has stood at the forefront of the people and become the master of the new democratic country. In order to accelerate the construction of our great motherland, we must learn from the advanced Soviet labor heroes, and we have a greater responsibility to emulate them! For this reason, I would like to warmly recommend this good book to our comrades, the workers of the whole country.

    介绍《苏联企业中的劳动英雄主义》
    颖奋
    《苏联企业中的劳动英雄主义》，这是一本极好的书，著者为苏尔。这是苏联男女工人、工程师、制造家、科学家和一切斯达哈诺夫工作者们的生动的画像。
    书中告诉了我们：伟大的社会主义国家苏联的优秀儿女们，是怎样的舍身奋斗，英勇工作，建设了并保卫了自己的祖国。第一节“新兴的国家”写着这样的情况：在帝俄时代，占全球六分之一的国土，十分之九是完全没有开发的空白地方，远东和西伯利亚被视为“穷乡僻壤”的省份，远北边隅则仍如洪水泛滥时代一样，毫无人迹，是“鸟兽不惊”的边区。自然界虽慨然赋予了俄国以各种珍宝，但因政权是把握在地主、贵族手中他们只知追逐个人私利，完全不关心工业发展，所以当时俄国连用的生铁、煤炭、剃头刀、针、衣扣都须从外国运来。及至十月革命的胜利，国家政权制度得到了根本的改变之后，依据了列宁、斯大林的英明计划，已使苏联变成了如今世界上强大而不可战胜的头等工业国家。当苏联在实行第一个五年计划时，英国作家威尔斯曾这样写道：“在森林遍野，农民愚昧无知，技术发展极微和工商业颓萎不振的广漠旷原上，能否再想出比此更大胆的计划呢？”特别当列宁宣布了关于俄罗斯电气化的著名国家计划后，他又讥讽的写道：“只有那些非常富于幻想的人们才会妄想在俄罗斯实行电气化哩！至于我个人是丝毫不能想像到的……”他还甚至“大胆”的推测到这是几万年以后的情形。并且各帝国主义国家的刊物上也都这样的嘲笑着：“布尔什维克企图在几年内实现那些在顺利条件下须要五十年才能完成的事业，而这种顺利条件，连布尔什维克自己也承认是没有的。”可是，在第二个五年计划时，这些苏维埃国家的敌人，再已经不是嘲笑的态度了，因为他们懂得了布尔什维克是言行不悖的。俄国在革命前，按工业规模占世界第五位，但经过这两个五年计划后，就已经占第二位了，仅次于美国。一九三八年第三个五年计划开始时，苏联在生产技术方面，在发展工业速度方面，就已经超过了各主要资本主义国家。到战前最后一年（一九四○年），苏联工业的产量，比一九一三年的水平线提高了十二倍，国家在二十九天内所出产的工业产品，就等于沙俄时代一整年的产品了！也就是列宁、斯大林式的速度把期限缩短了，使一年的工作在一个月内完成了，由于实行了这些英明的计划，以及继续实行的历次计划，使它不仅能抵抗希特拉的军事侵略，并且能把它粉碎。在一九四一年德寇背信弃义进攻苏联时，苏联机器制造业的产额，已超过了旧有水平的五十多倍。在这些年份中，随着这些伟大奇迹的发生，全国各地也就涌现了大批的“新人”了。一九一九年春，苏维埃共和国处在紧急关头；敌人从四面八方逼来威胁苏联，又加之到处饥荒，当时工人每天只可领到五十个格莱姆面包，并且是搀着麸皮的，在这样艰苦的时日，布尔什维克党中央委员会号召全体人民以革命的精神来进行工作，而工人也就以劳动英勇精神响应了党的号召。本年五月间，莫斯科——嘉桑路上的布尔什维克决议每天加工一小时，并在每礼拜六完工后再作六小时的工作，一直到完全战胜反革命的哥萨克军队为止。在他们的决议上这样写道：
    “我们共产党员，为夺取革命胜利，应当不吝惜自己的健康和生命，应当不要报酬的来作这种工作。”
    这一光荣的行动，很快就响应到全国各企业中的工人们里来了。他们明白：红军的胜利，革命的命运，共和国的生命都是有赖于他们的劳动的。经常忍饥挨饿而精疲力竭的人们都乐于自愿无报酬地献出自己的最后力量为祖国谋幸福。列宁当时对于这种劳动功勋写道：
    “难道这不是最伟大的英雄主义吗？”
    列宁称这种礼拜六为“伟大的首倡”，列宁认为这是以新的、共产主义的态度对待劳动的开始。他又写道：
    “凡是有平常工人奋不顾身，努力进行困苦劳动来关心于增加劳动生产率的地方，就是共产主义开始的地方”（《列宁全集》第二十四卷，第三四二页）
    社会主义工业第一个巨大建筑——斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂——于一九三○年六月落成了，当时在外国也曾引起了轻蔑的讽刺：“哼！布尔什维克建成了一个很大的工厂，甚至是美国所没有的。可是，无论如何他们自己是不会使用的，还得来请教我们的人才行呢！”诚然，当成千的苏联男女初到工厂来学习在海外运来的精妙车床上工作时是困难的，而且是非常困难的，就是当时的熟练工人也感到能力不够，机器不听人使用。但是，这些坚决不移，优秀的苏联儿女一定要按步就班研究这些奔流不息大批生产的精致复杂的科学！在工作中学会从未见过的新技术！赢得宝贵时间在几个月内学得美国在几十年内所积累的经验。在一九三五年八月三十日的夜间，在“中央依尔明”矿井居然发生了震动全球的事件，产生了社会主义劳动最伟大的胜利。这就是：优秀的掘煤工人斯达哈诺夫由于实行了挖煤分工和延长煤坑在不到六个钟头的时间就采掘了一百零二吨，两天以后，斯达哈诺夫竟又在六点钟的工作班内采掘了二百二十七吨，这是空前未有的社会纪录！他的这一伟大胜利，就以风驰电闪般不可阻遏的力量传播到苏联全国了！同年九月，在高尔基城的莫洛托夫汽车厂的打铁间里的青年生产队长布塞根，他每天思索着：为什么美国福特工厂的工人在一点钟内能出产一百多个曲角杠，而我们苏联铁匠有最好的机器装置，却连自己的很小的工作定额——九十六个曲角杠也不能完成呢？但是，这位年青的队长研究了科学的分工，开展了“为宝贵的一秒钟而斗争”和他改造了脚踏机的结果，原来一个曲角杠锤三十下往往还不能成功，但是这样便只须锤十五下、十下，一个曲角杠就制成功了；而全厂的工人，都不甘落后于自己的队长，因此每人都能在一个钟头内出产一百二十七、一百三十六、一百六十三个了。到了一九三七年，工人卜维里金竟在一分钟内就制成了五个曲角杠。正因如此，苏联在一九三六年时，造一辆“Ｍ——一”式的汽车须费四百七十八点钟的劳动（近二十个昼夜），但到了一九四○年的斯达哈诺夫运动周年时，则只用一百八十九点钟了，从前造两辆的时间，现在造五辆还多。由于节省几秒钟的结果，苏联全国在一年内就多产了几万辆汽车，福特工厂的生产率被苏联工人们抛到远远的后面去了。一九三五年二月间，齿刮机工人顾道夫，仅学习了六个月就可以独立工作，而且并在这齿刮机上作了发明，增加了车床的生产率十四倍。到一九三七年，顾道夫居然打破了世界纪录，以前制一个零件须一点半钟，并要经过五个单独手续，但顾道夫在三点五十八分钟内就制成了二百三十八个零件，超过了原定额的百分之九十倍！一点半钟的工作被他在一分钟内就完成了！同时，在苏联的工人们中间，还开展了兼职运动，同时管理多架不同的车床，很多工人能像精通自己车床一样熟悉邻近的车床。在莫斯科一个工厂里有两个斯达哈诺夫式的工作者由管理八架半自动式的齿刮车床转到管理十六架车床，后来又管理十八架，并渐次增加竟达到管理三十架车床！至于一个同时精通二个、三个以至四个专门技术的匠人那就很多了。
    在“转入战时轨范”一节，并专门描画了苏维埃女工们的英勇作风和气概，请看，下面这是莫斯科一个工厂的女工在给她被征入伍的亲友的一封信中，是多么生动亲切的写出了她们的伟大决心和对于自己祖国的无限忠诚呀！
    “你们往前线上去，我们留在后方，不过，对我们是没有前线与后方之分的。我们尽一切力量和所有精力代替你们的工作，保证你们一切必需品。若是需要的话，我们就昼夜不息的工作，若是需要的话，我们就手持武器来帮助你们。请你们放心吧，不要挂心我们，我们是懂得自己对于祖国的责任的，我们定以斯达哈诺夫式的劳动来巩固你们的战功。”当卫国战争一开始，成千成万的苏联妇女都进到了工厂、矿场、矿井去代替到前线去的父兄、子弟、丈夫的光荣的劳动岗位。有些妇女都很欢欣的给自己在前线上的丈夫写信：
    “我已经学会在你的车床上工作，真荣幸极了。此刻向你郑重宣誓：决作一个不玷你辱的伴侣！你准确地射杀德寇，我好好完成生产。”
    从前在苏联的许多工厂里，担任旋工和转塔旋工的只有男子；但现在这些工作间里差不多全是妇女了。挖煤女工和在打铁房的女工，她们都有全权这样自豪的说：“妇女能够担任任何工作，并不劣于男子。”每当必要时就有许多妇女职员、统计员、核算员、理财员、计划员、会计员都毫不动摇的学习着新的工作。
    “前线一要求，立刻就完成”一节中，描绘出苏联各大工厂中的工程师、制造家、工艺师们是怎样的发扬了“劳动与科学的结合”，并表现了伟大的令人赞叹的天才。一个制造仪器的工厂，可以出产简单轻便易用的杰格加略夫式手机关枪；一个制造纺织机器的工厂，可以变成制造迫击炮的工厂；一个制造细软木器的工厂，也为前线制造起地雷来了；一个小的修理作坊也可以制造起炸弹来了；一个制造汽水工厂的工人，竟以炸药代替甜蜜的柠檬汽水装在瓶子里给战士们去消灭敌人的坦克。因为战时速度不容许有久加思考的余地——需要很快的找到最好的方式，于是各工厂中的制造师、工艺师、冶金师之间的亲密合作就由此产生和巩固了。构造新炮，出产反坦克枪，各工作人员废寝忘食，一连五昼夜没有离开工厂；这些新武器都很快的在战场上受到了严格的、毫无瑕疵的考验，法西斯匪徒的坦克手们亲身感到了它那种极强的穿铁力量。
    写着苏维埃劳动英雄主义和如火如荼的革命竞赛，是在“强大的推动力”和“出产更多的金属”两节中。在伟大的十月社会主义革命二十四周年纪念前夜的比赛时，高尔基汽车厂的工作间中张贴有如下的标语：
    “本工作间组成了青年团员的前线生产队！”
    “前线生产队员担承每日至少执行两个生产定额，在未完成任务前，决不离开车床！”
    “大家向前线战士看齐！”
    这些团员们奋不顾身的劳动着，他们在一天内就完成了百分之二百三十的任务。过了几天，其他工作间也出现了少女组成的前线队，经过三四个月以后，这种前线生产队便在高尔基全省各地农业中、运输业中、建筑业中出现了。这些生产队员的口号就是：“在劳动英勇事业上，不要落后于红军战士。”他们都把前线的利益当成生命。
    再看看苏联工人们的英雄式的劳动和热烈的比赛吧！库兹涅茨克的冶铁工人马雷舍夫的熔炉上，每一次加速增产的炼钢，就能够制造一千发炮弹之用。他所节省的每一分点就等于多出产了十发炮弹！乌拉尔工厂工人瓦列也夫和锡道洛夫斯基，不但缩短冶铁时间到五点钟，竟能在每一平方米达上制钢十七吨。荣膺红旗的熔炉间匠人杜鲁汉诺夫和热尔宁，都因克服困难，缩短时间而分别获得列宁勋章和其他光荣奖励。当战争严酷考验的时日，阿尔泰工人海金提议与卡查赫共和国的钻掘工人比赛，这个号召遇到了热烈的同情。当海金一月十五日一班内完成了二十三个定额，过了两天就被邻近索科尔纳雅矿井工人胡加科夫一班内完成三十四个定额所超过了；但过了两个星期，苏联情报部就宣布了海金的新胜利——完成了生产定额百分之三千六百六十二。可是，到二月间，列宁诺高尔斯克矿井的道布洛杰也夫和索科尔纳雅矿井的得敏求克区两位匠师的炽烈比赛，得敏求克在一班内完成了任务百分之五千四百七十！他一点钟的生产定额一分钟就完成了，他一班的工作就采掘了一千四百吨的矿石，其数量可以载满一百辆车箱的列车！在这种情况下，管理车床的鲍塞也能在三架车床上制造一种复杂的零件而完成了二十多个定额，技术检查员在他制造的二十批零件中连一个缺点、一个不完备的零件也没有找出来，全都准确得毫厘不爽。他说：“所谓新纪录，不过是走上新道路的初步罢了。”乌拉尔各企业一百二十七万四千八百三十六名工作人员曾签名给斯大林写信说：
    “社会主义比赛力量之惊人是举世无双的。昨天还似乎是办不到的事情，今天已为千万人所能办到的了。劳动军在比赛的火焰中锻炼起来了。在工厂里的工作间中，在集体农庄田野上，这样英雄人物都日益倍增起来。”
    “鲁宁式的工作者”一节，是专门写苏联铁路工人和机车司机的奇迹。工人们为供应前线，使火车按时开出不浪费一分钟的，冒生命危险钻进烧得通红的火室里，把几点钟方能修好的严重损坏的火车器材，十分钟就修好了，使火车得以按时开出站去。火车司机鲁宁说：“每一个战士不仅会射击，并且会装卸自己使用的步枪和机关枪。我们铁路工人也应该这样，火车头就是我们的武器”。他又说：“预防发生毛病，易于以后治疗。”他的生产小队都是很小心的看护自己的火车头，擦拭、洗刷，并在开动之前仔细察看机器，因此他的车头不仅是速度快，而且每在洗刷锅炉时，别人都经常积有五六十个甚至七十个各种不同的损坏，而在鲁宁修理簿上所记载的顶多不过五、六个。
    社会主义国家苏联，伟大的世界和平的柱石，将是永远不可战胜的。苏联的工人们，给我们树立了光辉的榜样！今天，我们伟大的中华人民共和国已经诞生了，我们工人阶级已站在人民的前列，成为新民主主义国家的主人翁了。为了加紧建设我们伟大的祖国，我们必须向先进的苏维埃劳动英雄们学习，我们更有责任向他们看齐！为此，我特向我们全国的工人同志热烈推荐这本好书。
