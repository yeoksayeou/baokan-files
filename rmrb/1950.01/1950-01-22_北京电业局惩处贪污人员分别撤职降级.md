    Beijing Electric Power Bureau Punishes Corrupt Personnel with Dismissals and Demotions
    [Beijing News] Guan Zengshu, the procurement section chief of the North China Electric Power Administration's Beijing Electric Power Bureau (formerly the North China Electric Power Beijing Branch), along with employees Yan Tiezhuang, Chen Shizhuo, Shen Jiajian, and Zhu Yunkuan, all of whom were retained personnel from the old regime, were punished for corruption and malfeasance in procurement. When they were procuring equipment and raw materials in the reactionary Nationalist ruling institutions, they frequently accepted bribes. After liberation, they did not change their bad habits. In April of last year, when Beijing Sen Tai Timber Company delivered goods on behalf of Tianjin Xinhua Timber Company, procurement section employee Yan Tiezhuang and others accepted bribes. In September, when ordering Northeast pine wood poles from Tianjin Hengyu Timber Company, they again accepted bribes. On the evening of September 1st, Wang Minzhai, an agent for Hengyu Timber Company, sent 300,000 yuan in bribes to Yan Tiezhuang's home. Yan said it was not enough to distribute, so Wang sent four more checks the next day, totaling 1.34 million yuan. Yan Tiezhuang then wrote four letters in the name of Hengyu Timber Company, distributing 550,000 yuan to section chief Guan Zengshu, 100,000 yuan to employee Chen Shizhuo, and 50,000 yuan each to employees Zhu Yunkuan and Shen Jiajian. After receiving the money, Guan Zengshu immediately wrote back refusing it, while Chen, Zhu, and others all accepted it. When Guan inquired about the matter, Yan Tiezhuang admitted to accepting bribes, and Chen, Zhu, and others also confessed. Wang Minzhai of Hengyu Timber Company was then brought in to clarify the facts, and the bribe money checks were returned. However, Guan Zengshu attempted to deceive his superiors by concealing the truth and not reporting to the company. Later, it was discovered that Yan Tiezhuang had not returned a 250,000 yuan check, and feeling it was difficult to handle, he reported it to the company. In early December, the company decided to announce the corruption incident in the procurement section to all personnel for discussion, and all corrupt personnel were gathered for study. By December 7th, the company, based on the opinions of all employees and their own understanding of their mistakes, gave them separate punishments. Although Guan Zengshu refused to accept bribes, he exhibited serious bureaucratic tendencies, had many loopholes in contracts signed with merchants, and failed to promptly report to his superiors. He was given the punishment of dismissal and demotion. Although Yan Tiezhuang was the primary culprit in this corruption, after studying, he confessed all his past mistakes and was leniently treated, receiving the punishment of removal from his original position and demotion to public service. Chen Shizhuo, Zhu Yunkuan, and Shen Jiajian had a poor work attitude, were lax in their work, and sought personal gain. During the study, they continued to argue and conceal their faults, showing no remorse. It was decided to give them the punishment of suspension of duties and pay. The resolution of this corruption incident greatly educated all employees of the company, who unanimously agreed that they should strengthen criticism and self-criticism, correct mistakes in a timely manner, and improve their work.

    北京电业局惩处贪污人员分别撤职降级
    【北京讯】华北电业管理总局北京电业局（原华北电业北京分公司）采购股股长关曾述、职员阎铁庄、陈士倬、沈嘉剑、朱蕴宽等五人，皆为留用旧人员，在采购中贪污舞弊，受到处分。他们在国民党反动统治机构中从事采购器材原料时，经常受贿。解放后，不改恶习，去年四月北京森泰木行代天津新华木行交货时，采购股职员阎铁庄等即曾受贿。九月向天津恒裕木行定购东北松木电杆时，又接受贿赂，九月一日晚恒裕木行代理人王敏斋向阎铁庄家送去贿款三十万元，阎说不够分，次日王又送去支票四张，共一百三十四万元。阎铁庄即以恒裕木行名义写了四封信，分送股长关曾述五十五万元，职员陈士倬十万元，职员朱蕴宽、沈嘉剑各五万元。关曾述接到后，即复信拒绝，其他陈、朱等人则全部收下，关追问此事，阎铁庄才承认是受贿，陈、朱等人也相继说出。即找来恒裕木行王敏斋，问明事实经过后，当将所贿款项支票退回。但关曾述却企图瞒上不瞒下的欺蒙上级，不向公司报告。后来发觉阎铁庄有二十五万元支票未退，感到难于处理，才向公司报告，十二月初公司决定将采购股贪污事件向全体人员宣布，由大家进行讨论，并将所有贪污人员集中学习。至十二月七日，公司乃根据全体职工意见与他们对自己错误的认识，分别给以处分。关曾述虽拒受贿，但存在严重的官僚主义作风，与商人订立合同漏洞极多，不及时向上级请示报告，给予撤职降级处分。阎铁庄虽为这次贪污首要，但经过学习后，将过去所犯错误均已坦白，从宽处理，给予撤销原职，降级为公役的处分。陈士倬、朱蕴宽、沈嘉剑三人平日工作态度不好，工作松懈，贪图私利，在学习中仍争辩掩饰，不知悔改，决定给予停职停薪处分。这一贪污事件的解决，使全公司职工受到很大教育，一致认为：今后要加强批评和自我批评，及时纠正错误，把工作搞好。
