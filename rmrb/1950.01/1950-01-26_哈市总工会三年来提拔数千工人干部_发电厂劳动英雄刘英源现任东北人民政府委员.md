    [This news report from the Northeast] Since 1946, the Harbin Federation of Trade Unions has cultivated and promoted a large number of worker cadres. According to statistics from 1948 and 1949, a total of 4,686 staff and worker cadres were promoted and transferred to various locations inside and outside Shanhaiguan to participate in work. The city mainly cultivated and promoted cadres through two methods: First, paying attention to discovering and cultivating activists in actual work and specific movements, and promoting outstanding talents among them after the movements ended. The city had taken a detour in this work. Before February 1948, the union leadership's understanding of integrating the selection of worker cadres with production was not clear, focusing on selecting young workers, which had little effect on production. After the Xinhua News Agency published the editorial "Persist in the Correct Line of the Workers' Movement, Oppose Left-Leaning Adventurism" on February 7 of the same year, the union leadership began to clarify its direction, starting from production and promoting a large number of labor heroes and model workers. For example, in the municipal enterprises' model creation movement and production competitions, veteran hero Liu Yingyuan of the power plant (now the deputy director of the Fushun Power Plant and a member of the Northeast People's Government), Song Ziliang, and others were promoted. Currently, cadres are continuing to be cultivated and promoted in the state-owned enterprises' innovation record movement and the signing of labor-capital collective contracts in private enterprises. The second method is to open a large number of training classes in response to the needs of the situation and the development of the workers' movement. In the past three years, a total of 25 worker training classes have been held, each cultivating and promoting a large number of cadres.

    How can the working ability of new cadres be continuously improved? Experience has shown that the most effective way is for the leadership to specifically and meticulously arrange their work. For example, when the Xiangfang District Federation of Trade Unions arranged work, it initially only conveyed the principles and guidelines, and as a result, the new cadres had no way to proceed, and the work situation could not be reported. Later, the office strived to be specific and meticulous when assigning work, which improved the new cadres' confidence in their work and enabled them to complete their tasks well. Secondly, adopting the method of old cadres mentoring apprentices is also very effective in improving the working ability of new cadres. At the same time, new cadres should be boldly given work, and their work should be regularly checked and helped. When the work comes to an end, they should be urged to make summaries and helped to correct the summaries written. In addition, the living difficulties of newly promoted cadres who have left production should be appropriately resolved; it is best to reduce transfers so that they can become specialized talents in a department.

    哈市总工会三年来提拔数千工人干部
    发电厂劳动英雄刘英源现任东北人民政府委员
    【本报东北讯】哈尔滨市总工会自一九四六年以来，培养与提拔了大批工人干部。据一九四八、一九四九两年统计，共提拔职工干部四千六百八十六名，分别调到关内外各地参加工作。该市培养与提拔干部主要通过两种方式：第一、在实际工作和某一运动当中注意发现与培养积极分子，运动结束后提拔其中的优秀人材。该市在此一工作上曾走过一段弯路，一九四八年二月以前，工会领导上选拔工人干部结合生产的思想不明确，着重选拔青年工人，结果在生产中作用不大；同年二月七日新华社发表“坚持职工运动的正确路线，反对左倾冒险主义”社论以后，工会领导上始明确了方向，从生产出发，提拔了大批的劳动英雄和模范工作者。如市政企业在创造模范运动与生产竞赛中，提拔了发电厂的老英雄刘英源（现任抚顺发电厂副厂长，东北人民政府委员）、宋子良等人。目前则在公营企业的创新纪录运动与私营企业的签订劳资集体合同中继续培养与提拔干部。第二种方式是随着形势的需要和职工运动的开展而大量开办训练班。三年来职工训练班共举办了二十五期，每期培养与提拔了大批干部。
    如何使新干部的工作能力不断提高？经验证明，以领导上具体地、细致地布置其工作为最有效。如香坊区工会办事处布置工作时，起初只把方针原则布置下去，结果新干部没办法，工作情况也不能反映上来。以后该处布置工作时力求具体细致，提高了新干部的工作信心，很好地完成了任务。其次，采取由老干部带徒弟的方式等对新干部工作能力的提高也很收效。同时，对新干部要大胆地给以工作，并经常注意检查帮助，当工作告一段落时，要督促其做总结并帮助批改所写总结。此外，对新提拔脱离生产的干部，要适当地解决其生活困难；最好少调动，使其成为一个部门里的专门人材。
