(Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 3rd) Minister Ma Wenrui of the Organization Department of the CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau delivered a report on the ideological conduct of Party member cadres and the unity of new and old cadres at a conference of Party member cadres in Xi'an City last November 4th. An excerpt is as follows:

The vast majority of cadres have maintained excellent traditions, but the ideological conduct of some cadres has developed some undesirable tendencies.

Since the cadres of the border region's institutions entered Xi'an five months ago, the vast majority have maintained the excellent tradition of hard work and plain living, and have conscientiously implemented urban policies and urban rules. Many comrades are unfamiliar with urban work or have no urban work experience at all, but they can pay attention to learning and studying. Some comrades, in order to do their work well, spare no effort, even to the point of becoming ill from overwork. Because the vast majority of cadres can actively work hard and the Party's policies are correct, our work has won the praise and support of the broad masses of the people. Chairman Mao gave a telegram to Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, calling on cadres across the country to forever maintain the style of hard struggle they had in Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in the past. We should especially cherish and remember this instruction. But on the other hand, after entering the city, some cadres, especially some old cadres or older cadres, have developed some undesirable tendencies in their thinking and conduct:

First, they are not at ease with their work. Some comrades are often uneasy because they lack a spirit of dedication to long-term work or a spirit of doing their job well. For example, some mistakenly believe that the work of higher-level leading organs is simple and progress is slow, while the work at lower levels is comprehensive and progress is fast; some foreign cadres, seeing that the country is about to be unified, want to return to their hometowns or go to other places to work, believing that they can take charge of one aspect and be promoted quickly. This is followed by the issue of treatment. Some believe that the war is coming to an end and demand specialization, unwilling to do general administrative work or clerical work; some old cadres do have real family difficulties that the organization has not resolved well, so they are also uneasy; some comrades from worker-peasant backgrounds feel that they are "old and uneducated" and feel that they have difficulties working in high-level leading organs. Some even see that new cadres from intellectual backgrounds are making rapid progress, and instead of encouraging themselves to be progressive, they develop a pessimistic mood. Their manifestations are many, but the most fundamental reasons are two: on the one hand, there are shortcomings in leadership, that is, leading organs and leading cadres have empiricism and bureaucratism, are not good at summarizing work experience, helping cadres learn well, so as to continuously improve the ideological ability and level of cadres and obtain more progress. The personal life, family difficulties, and political treatment of cadres have not been studied and determined more rationally, and the understanding of some cadres is not enough, so the allocation of work is also inappropriate, etc. On the other hand, some cadres have problems in their thinking, that is, they have individualism, study revolutionary cause less, and think more about personal status and enjoyment. The more they haggle over personal gains and losses, the less they can be at ease with their work. If they do not overcome this idea of pursuing personal status and enjoyment, they will not be at ease no matter where they are transferred to or what work they do, because the cause of the Party and the people does not allow personal interests to be the first.

Second, their work style is lax and procrastinating, and their work efficiency is not high. This is manifested in the slow handling of problems, often losing timeliness; lack of initiative in work, doing whatever comes their way; or work plans cannot be completed on time, being busy and chaotic, attending to one thing and neglecting another, and even putting off official business for one or two months without being able to leave the house. This is mainly because the leadership has not or has not clearly solved the establishment of scientific work systems and work methods, and remains in the rural work style, so that work falls into a passive state. Secondly, some cadres lack a sense of responsibility. Even if there are good systems and good methods, if cadres do not have a positive sense of responsibility, and if they think "whether they do it or not, it's all the same," it is impossible to do the work well.

Third, some cadres have hedonistic ideas, and individual cadres have committed corruption and degeneration. Some people think that the revolution has been victorious, so they are unwilling to do hard work or go to difficult places; some want to go to enterprise departments, thinking that they can enjoy themselves; some want to work as teachers, thinking that they can earn salaries; and others want to work in aviation, thinking that they can fly around. The root cause of these erroneous ideas is related to the current situation of victory and the environment of entering the city from the countryside, but the most fundamental thing is that some cadres lack the steadfastness of the proletariat in their thinking, which is a manifestation of the vacillation of the petty bourgeoisie. If we do not pay attention to overcoming this kind of thinking in the face of victory, it is very dangerous and easy to develop. Because people with this kind of personal hedonistic thinking are prone to wavering, confusion, and loss of the Party's position, whether in good or bad environments.

Fourth, some cadres are politically paralyzed and undisciplined. They think that the enemy has been driven away and everything is going well, so some are careless and lose important telegrams and military equipment; some speak without regard for the occasion and use people without scrutiny; some are self-proclaimed and disregard Party discipline, and even infringe upon the interests of the masses. These are all manifestations of low class consciousness and weak Party spirit. It will cause great harm to the Party.

Take necessary steps to grasp ideological leadership and ideological education; implement regular democratic assessments and appraisals.

If the above-mentioned serious problems in the thinking and conduct of these old cadres or older cadres are not corrected, we cannot improve our current work. Therefore, our leading comrades are required to grasp ideological leadership and ideological education. At present, the following steps should be taken: First, the administrative leadership of the organs and the Party branches should cooperate, and in conjunction with the work summary of this year, promote democracy and use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to conduct in-depth reviews and summaries of the ideological conduct of cadres and leadership methods, so that each cadre can fully express their understanding and opinions, analyze and summarize them, formulate plans for future improvement, and improve both leaders and those being led. At present, leading comrades should pay special attention to three points: (1) Every period of work should be planned and step-by-step, and the central link must be grasped. Because no revolutionary work is unimportant, and each item is necessary, if everything is equal and there is no priority, it will inevitably lead to being busy with affairs all day long, losing one's leadership role and becoming an ordinary clerk, and as a result, nothing will be done well. (2) Establish a system of inspecting and summarizing work so as to improve work and improve cadres in a timely manner. (3) Establish learning life to improve the ideological and theoretical level of cadres. The learning of leading cadres should be regarded as one of the main tasks of the leaders of organs and the branches of organs. Otherwise, the above-mentioned problems in the thinking and conduct of cadres will be difficult to overcome, and the work will be difficult to improve. Second, leading organs must maintain a certain number of backbones in the allocation of cadres in order to promote work, but appropriate adjustments can also be made. For example, cadres who are not suitable for organ work can be transferred to work at lower levels or sent to Party schools to study and improve. In addition, appropriate solutions should be studied and implemented for cadres' reading documents, attending meetings, family difficulties, and the use of service personnel, so that cadres can concentrate on their work. Third, correct methods of reward and punishment must be implemented. Cadres who have a hard-working style, can connect with the masses, and have outstanding work achievements should be given spiritual and material rewards; those who are corrupt, degenerate, and otherwise seriously derelict in their duties must be given due punishment according to the severity of the circumstances, so that rewards and punishments are clear. It is wrong to fail to distinguish between good and bad and to take a lenient attitude towards mistakes. However, the most basic way to correct the mistakes of cadres is education, and punishment is also for education. Those who have committed serious mistakes and refuse to correct them must be given disciplinary punishment. This will educate them more deeply and also educate everyone. Secondly, it is necessary to implement regular democratic assessments and appraisals for all cadres. Each organ should formulate its own appraisal plan for the end of this year and conduct it on time, so as to further understand the cadres, especially to educate the cadres powerfully through the appraisal method.

Of the three types of cadres now available, new cadres are the largest in number, and how to unite, educate, and use new cadres is a very important issue in current work.

At present, the staff of the border region's organs are roughly divided into three types: one is old cadres or older cadres, one is young intellectuals who have newly joined the work, and the other is retained personnel, that is, retained civil servants and technicians. According to statistics from several units within the border region government, the latter two types account for more than 70% of the total number of staff, and even more at the lower levels. According to statistics from the Weinan Sub-district, new cadres account for 90% of the total number of cadres. With the development of the situation and the needs of construction work, the number of new cadres will increase even more. Therefore, how to unite, educate, and use these new comrades so that they can better serve the people is a very important issue in our current work.

Most of the young students working in the organs of the border region have undergone education and training at Yanda University, Finance School, and Huada University and Geda University in North China. Generally speaking, they are active and enthusiastic in their work and willing to learn from old cadres. However, because most of them are from petty-bourgeois backgrounds and lack revolutionary training, their organizational concepts are still weak, and they are prone to emphasizing personal interests and opposing personal aspirations to revolutionary interests. They generally have many fantasies and are afraid of running into obstacles. At the beginning of their participation in the revolution, they thought that everything was good about the Communist Party, but after seeing some bad or unsatisfactory things, they became dissatisfied and even disheartened and disappointed. Some have not completely gotten rid of the airs of old intellectuals, so they lack a hard-working style. Regarding retained personnel, their general level of education is higher, some have certain skills, and their work efficiency is also higher in some respects. Most of them are deeply dissatisfied with the rule of the Kuomintang and are willing to participate in revolutionary work; however, their revolutionary outlook on life has not yet been well established, and their thinking of serving the people is not enough. Many of them participate in the revolution in order to solve their livelihood and career problems; in their work attitude, there is a concept of employment and habits of liberalism; in their thinking, there are undesirable ideas brought from the old society, such as enjoying life, fame, status, and emphasizing private feelings. But most of them are eager to make progress. Therefore, we can affirm that most of them can be won over, transformed, and participate in revolutionary work.

In the five months or so since entering Xi'an, most of the new and old cadres in most departments have not experienced serious disunity or disputes. This is because the general old cadres understand the policy of treating new personnel, and the general new cadres are willing to learn from the old cadres. But it is not to say that there are no problems in the relationship between new and old cadres. On the contrary, at present, many of our old cadres still do not have a sufficient understanding of the policy of "uniting, educating, transforming, and using new cadres," so they do less work in this area proactively; some old cadres still cannot influence and guide these new personnel with their own exemplary behavior, but consider themselves meritorious officials, are arrogant, and spoil the relationship; some places have excessive demands on new personnel, lack specific help, or improperly allocate work, which affects their enthusiasm; others are not familiar enough with new personnel, are not enthusiastic in life, do not get close enough, or feel that they cannot treat new personnel "neither cold nor hot," making it difficult for them. New personnel feel like they are "guests." This forms a situation in which new and old cadres become separate groups, unable to integrate in life.

The solution is: old cadres play a backbone and leading role, cultivate, transform, and help new cadres, learn from each other, and learn from each other's strengths.

Therefore, how to unite, educate, and use new cadres must be taken as one of the main topics in our work and solved well. We should understand that a large number of new cadres, especially retained personnel, have not received any revolutionary education, and their positions and views are undoubtedly still very vague. They do not understand or understand very little about our Party's policies, principles, and working methods, but they can continue to learn and make progress. Then we must rely on our old cadres to play a backbone role and a leading role to cultivate, transform, and help these new cadres. To do this, we must first require our old cadres to change the above-mentioned various problems in their thinking and conduct and improve themselves further. To do this, we must strengthen mutual learning between new and old cadres and learn from each other's strengths. New cadres learn from old cadres their firm political stand, rich work experience, and hard-working style; old cadres learn from new cadres culture, skills, etc. When using new personnel, we must take a serious attitude, that is to say, we cannot use them indiscriminately without principles, but we must oppose close-doorism. All new personnel who have no political problems and have certain talents should be used. When helping and transforming them, we must take into account their specific circumstances and not use the standards of old cadres to measure them. We should help them progress in unity. Under normal circumstances, if the relationship between new and old cadres is not good, the old cadres should bear the main responsibility. This issue is very important, and Chairman Mao often warned us about it, because old cadres have received more education and understand more, and should do so. However, we cannot simply accommodate or take a lenient attitude towards new personnel in terms of political ideology. We must resolutely implement the policy of education and transformation. Only by earnestly doing this work can our work be further improved.

    纠正干部不良作风  加强新老干部团结
    中共中央西北局组织部马文瑞部长报告
    【新华社西安三日电】中共中央西北局组织部马文瑞部长去年十一月四日在西安市党员干部大会上，作了关于党员干部思想作风与新老干部团结问题的报告。兹摘要如下：
    绝大部分干部保持了优良传统，有些干部的思想作风却发展了一些不良偏向。
    边区机关干部自进入西安的五个月来，绝大部分保持了艰苦朴素的优良传统，认真执行了城市政策与城市规则，许多同志对城市工作生疏，或根本没有城市工作经验，但能注意学习和钻研，甚至有个别同志为了做好工作，不遗余力，竟至积劳成疾。由于绝大部分干部能积极努力和党的政策正确，我们的工作已获得广大人民的赞许和拥护。毛主席给延安、陕甘宁边区有个电报，要全国干部永远保持过去在延安和陕甘宁边区的艰苦奋斗作风，我们对这一指示，特别应珍贵地牢记。但另一方面，在进城之后，有些干部特别是有些老干部或较老干部的思想作风上发生或发展了一些不良偏向：
    一、对工作不安心。一部分同志由于对长期做一种工作的事业精神或做好工作的精神很差，而经常不安心。比如有些错误地认为上级领导机关工作单纯，进步慢，下面工作全面，进步快；有些外籍干部，看见全国行将统一，便想回本地，或到别的地方去工作，认为可以担当一面，提拔得快。随之而来的是闹待遇问题，有的认为战争快要结束，要求专业化，不愿再做一般行政工作或事务工作；有些老干部家庭确实有困难，组织上未很好解决，也就不安心了；有些工农出身的同志，觉得自己“年纪大，文化低”，感到在高级领导机关工作有困难，甚至有的看到知识分子出身的新干部进步快，没有策励自己的进取心，却产生了一种悲观情绪。他们的表现有很多，但最基本的原因有两点：即一方面是领导上有缺点，即领导机关和领导干部有经验主义和事务主义，不善于总结工作经验，帮助干部很好地学习，借以不断地提高干部思想能力水平，获得更多的进步，对于干部个人生活，家庭困难，政治待遇等未能研究确定得更为合理，以及对某些干部了解不够，因而工作的分配亦有不适当等。另一方面，便是一些干部思想上有毛病，即存在个人主义，对革命事业钻研得少，而对于个人地位，享受则想得多，愈斤斤计较个人得失就愈不能安心工作。如果不克服这种追求个人地位、享受的思想，就是调到任何地方作任何工作也不会安心的，因为党和人民的事业，不允许以个人利益为第一的。
    二、作风上疲蹋拖拉与工作效率不高。表现在处理问题迟缓，常失时效；工作上主动性差，来什么事作什么事；或工作计划不能按时完成，忙忙乱乱，顾此失彼，甚至把公事压到一两月出不了门等。这主要是由于领导上没有或没有明确解决建立科学的工作制度和工作方法，而停留在农村作风上，以致工作陷于被动。其次，是一些干部的责任心差，虽有好制度和好办法，但干部没有积极的责任心，所谓“干不干，一斤半”，这是不可能把工作做好的。
    三、某些干部存在着享乐思想和个别干部发生贪污腐化的现象。有些人以为革命胜利了，就不愿作艰苦工作或到艰苦的地方去；有的想到企业部门去，认为可以享受；有的想作教员工作，认为可以赚薪水；还有的想作航空工作，认为可以飞来飞去。这些错误思想发生的根源与目前胜利的局面和由乡村进入城市的环境有关，但最基本的是某些干部思想上无产阶级的坚定性差，是小资产阶级动摇性的一种表现。这些人不了解我们今天的事业只是“万里长征走完了第一步”。在胜利局面下对这种思想如不注意克服是很危险而又容易发展的。因为，具有这种个人享乐思想的人，不论在好或坏的环境中都容易动摇、迷惑、丧失党的立场的。
    四、某些干部存在政治上麻痹与无纪律现象。他们认为敌人打跑了，万事大吉了，于是有的就粗心大意，丢了重要的电报和军器；有的说话不看场合，用人不经审查；有的自命不凡，目无党纪，甚至侵犯群众利益。这都是阶级觉悟不高，党性不强的表现。它会使党蒙受很大危害。
    采取必要步骤，抓紧思想领导与思想教育；要实行定期的民主考核与鉴定。
    上述这些老干部或较老干部存在的思想作风上严重的毛病，如不加纠正，就不能把我们现在的工作提高一步。因此，要求我们的领导同志抓紧思想领导与思想教育。在目前应该采取下列的步骤：第一，机关行政领导和党的支部配合起来，并与本年度的工作总结结合起来，发扬民主，运用批评与自我批评的武器，对干部思想作风与领导方法作深入的检讨总结，使每一干部能充分地讲出自己的认识和意见，加以分析总结，订出今后改进的方案，把领导者与被领导者提高一步。在目前领导同志应特别注意三点：（一）每一时期的工作都应有计划有步骤，并须抓住中心环节。因为革命工作没有一项不重要的，每一件也是必需的，如果样样平列没有轻重缓急，势必形成整天忙于事务，使自己失去领导作用变成普通的办事者，而结果什么也办不好。（二）建立检查总结工作制度，以便能及时地改进工作，提高干部。（三）建立学习生活，提高干部的思想、理论水平。领导干部的学习应当做为机关领导人与机关支部的主要任务之一。不然，上述干部思想作风上的毛病将难以克服，工作也难以改进。第二，领导机关在干部配备上必须保持有一定数量的骨干，以利于推进工作，但亦可作适当调整。如对于不适宜于机关工作的干部，可调到下面工作或送入党校学习、提高。此外对于干部阅读文件、参加会议、家庭困难、勤杂人员使用等，都应分别研究加以适当的解决，使干部能集中精力于工作。第三，要实行正确的奖惩办法。对于作风艰苦、能联系群众、工作成绩卓著的干部应实行精神的和物质的奖励；对于贪污、堕落及其他严重渎职者，须按情节轻重给以应得的处分，做到赏罚分明。如果好坏不分，犯了错误也采取姑息的态度是错误的。但改正干部之错误，最基本的办法还是教育，而处分也是为了教育。对犯有严重错误而坚持不改者，一定要给以纪律处分。这才能对他本人教育深一点，并且也教育了大家。其次，对于全体干部，务须实行定期的民主考核与鉴定，各机关即应订出本年终的鉴定计划，按时去进行，借以进一步了解干部，特别是通过鉴定的方式，有力地教育干部。
    现有的三种干部，新干部数量最大，如何团结、教育和使用新干部是目前工作中的很重要的问题
    目前边区各机关的工作人员，大体有三种：一种是老干部或较老干部，一种是新参加工作的青年知识分子，再一种是留用人员，即留用的公教人员与技术人员。据边区政府内几个单位的统计，后两种人已占到工作人员总数的百分之七十以上，下面则更多。据渭南分区统计，新干部占干部总数的十分之九。随着形势的发展与建设工作的需要，新干部将更增多。因此，如何团结、教育和使用这些新同志，使之更好地为人民服务，是我们目前工作中很重要的问题。
    现在边区各机关中工作的青年学生，大部分经过了延大、财校及华北的华大、革大的教育训练，他们一般地工作积极、热情，愿向老干部学习。但因他们多系小资产阶级出身和革命锻炼不够之故，组织观念尚薄弱，容易强调个人兴趣，把个人志趣与革命利益对立起来。一般的幻想多，怕碰钉子，初开始参加革命以为共产党一切都好，后来看见一点不好或不如意的地方，就不满意，甚至灰心失望。有的旧知识分子架子还没有完全去掉，因而艰苦的作风不够。关于留用人员，一般的文化程度较高，部分人有一定的技术，工作效率在某些方面亦较高。他们大部分对国民党统治深怀不满，愿参加革命工作；但他们革命的人生观还未很好地确立，为人民服务的思想还很不够。他们中有许多人参加革命是为了解决生活问题，职业问题；在工作态度上，存在着雇佣观念和自由主义习气；在思想上有从旧社会带来的生活享受、名誉、地位、讲私情等不良意识。但他们多是要求进步的。所以我们肯定地说，他们中大部分是可以争取改造和参加革命工作的。
    在进入西安的五个多月中，大多数部门中的大部分新老干部，没有发生严重的不团结和闹纠纷的现象。这是由于一般老干部关于对待新人员的政策尚了解，和一般新干部愿意向老干部学习的原故。但并不是说在新老干部关系上就没有问题了。相反的，目前我们许多老干部对“团结、教育、改造、使用新干部”这一方针还认识不足，因而主动地在这方面做工作就少；有些老干部还不能以自己的模范行为影响和引导这些新人员，而以功臣自居，盛气凌人，把关系搞不好；有的地方对新人员要求过高，具体帮助少，或工作分配不当，影响他们的积极性；还有的对新人员不够熟悉，生活上也不热情，不大接近，或觉得对新人员“冷热不得”，前后为难。新人员则感到自己像在“为客”。这样便形成新老干部各成一堆，生活上不能打成一片。
    解决的办法是：老干部起骨干、带头作用，培养、改造与帮助新干部，互相学习，取长补短。
    因此，如何团结、教育和使用新干部必须当为我们工作中主要课题之一，加以很好地解决。我们应当了解大批新干部，特别是留用人员，他们还没有受过什么革命的教育，他们的立场、观点毫无疑义还很模糊，对我党的政策、原则、工作方法是不懂得或懂得很少，但是他们可以不断学习进步的。那么就要倚靠我们老干部起骨干作用和带头作用，来培养、改造、帮助这些新干部。要这样，就必须首先要求我们老干部在思想作风上把上述的各种毛病改掉，把自己更加提高。要这样，就必须加强新老干部互相学习，取长补短。新干部向老干部学习他们坚定的政治立场，丰富的工作经验，艰苦朴素的工作作风等；老干部向新干部学习文化、技能等。在使用新人员时要持严肃态度，就是说不能毫无原则地乱用，但必须反对关门主义。凡是政治上没有问题，有一定才能的新人员，就应使用。在帮助、改造他们时，要体贴他们的具体情况，不能以老干部的尺度去衡量他们，应在团结之中帮助他们进步。在一般情形下，如果新老干部关系弄不好，老干部应负主要责任。这个问题很重要，这是毛主席经常告诫我们的，因为老干部受的教育多，懂的要多，应该如此。但我们对于新人员，不能在政治思想上一味迁就，或采取姑息态度，必须坚决贯彻教育改造的方针。也只有认真做好了这一工作，我们的工作才能更加提高一步。
