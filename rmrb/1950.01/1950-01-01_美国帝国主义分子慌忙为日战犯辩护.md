Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 31st—As twelve Japanese war criminals confessed during the Khabarovsk trials to the heinous crimes committed by Japanese militarists in preparing and using "bacteriological weapons," American imperialists have come out in a flurry to defend them. According to a United Press report, Sebald, head of the Diplomatic Section of MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo and the U.S. representative to the Far Eastern Commission, claimed, without citing any evidence, during an interview with a UP reporter on the 28th, that the Khabarovsk trials were "possibly fabricated" and "a smokescreen." Keenan, the former chief prosecutor for the U.S. at the Tokyo International Military Tribunal, defended the Japanese germ warfare criminals by saying, "His investigators did not find that the Japanese army used germ warfare in World War II."

The U.S. Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, published an article on the 26th denouncing MacArthur for deliberately concealing evidence of Japan's preparation and use of bacteria in World War II. The Daily Worker said, "MacArthur's attempt to cover up these crimes proves that the chief military planners of the American war plan in the Far East are desperately suppressing the democratic resurgence of Japan, making this country a Wall Street's imperialist appendage."

    美国帝国主义分子慌忙为日战犯辩护
    【新华社北京三十一日电】当十二名日本战犯在伯力审讯中供出日本军国主义者在准备与使用“细菌武器”中的滔天罪行时，美帝国主义分子却慌张地出来为他们辩护。据合众社消息，东京麦克阿瑟总部的外交组组长、美国出席对日委员会的代表赛鲍尔二十八日在接见该社记者时，没有举出任何根据地扬言伯力审判“可能是捏造”，“是烟幕”。前东京国际军事法庭美人首席检察官季楠，为日本细菌战犯辩护说：“他的调查员没有发现日军在第二次世界大战中采用细菌战。”
    美共机关报工人日报二十六日著文斥责麦克阿瑟故意掩盖日本在第二次世界大战中准备与使用细菌的证据。工人日报说：“麦克阿瑟企图掩饰这些罪行，证明远东美国战争计划的主要军事策划者，正拚命压制日本的民主复兴，使这个国家成为华尔街的帝国主义附庸。”
