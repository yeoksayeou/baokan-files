    My Year
    Fei Xiaotong

    Nineteen forty-nine was a "year of learning" for me. In this year, I saw so many things I had never seen in my life, and heard so many things I had never heard in my life. Not only that, but even the things I usually saw and heard revealed meanings that they had never shown before. A magnificent world full of life unfolded solemnly before my eyes, making me bow my head in humility.

    At the beginning of last year, as winter ended and spring arrived, Beiping had not yet been liberated, but Tsinghua Garden had already shaken off the reactionary rule. I had the opportunity to follow several seniors on a trip to Shijiazhuang. The truck drove on the uneven road, and in the same direction as us, far and near, moving forward were continuous teams, one by one, group by group, line by line. Coming towards us were carts of villagers driving grain convoys, with a flag inserted on the carts, and no soldiers pressing them; they were still moving forward late at night with lanterns lit, and from afar, they looked like rows of red stars. — This impression moved me. What impression was it? Simply put: an internal, spontaneous unity. These tens of thousands of people, countless actions, were interwoven and coordinated into an iron torrent, an unparalleled force. What wove and coordinated them together? It was a unified goal emanating from the hearts of everyone: revolution.

    I have visited the rows of British naval warships and witnessed the scale of the Allied air force bases in Africa during the war. But I didn't feel as moved as I did when I saw the grain convoys on the North China Plain this time. From the former, I could only know the greatness of power, but from the latter, I could understand the depth of power. There is a fundamental difference here, a difference between form and content. A huge form can become rigid and inflexible, but a profound content will develop and grow. Intellectuals like me, who have not actively participated in the revolutionary ranks, are ignorant of the deep vitality that is latent, unfamiliar with it, and even find it difficult to understand. Therefore, they lack a grasp of historical development and lack confidence in the people's liberation. It is just this slight difference that leads to great errors, causing oneself to fall into error in estimating the world situation. It is also this slight difference that makes oneself feel great, speak bombastically, and presumptuously believe that a scholar can know everything under heaven by staying at home.

    Bowing my head, and looking again at the deeds that had taken place on this North China Plain, the "miracles" that I could not believe before, I can now feel are inevitable. The tunnel warfare in Central Hebei sounds like a myth, but it is commonplace for people who refuse to submit. I used to have no confidence in China's industrialization, so I wrote about the "Xiaokang Economy." I thought this way because I felt that China's national income was low, capital could not be accumulated, the population was large, producing just enough to eat, the technology was backward, and science was underdeveloped. Everything was like chains dragging on hands and feet. The root of this set of ideas is a lack of confidence in the power of the people. Without this confidence, one will inevitably hold back and willingly fall behind. Therefore, this trip gave me a jolt. The lack of confidence among intellectuals actually only reflects the weakness and incompetence of the Chinese bourgeoisie. The people who have been tempered by a hundred years of revolutionary struggle are not like this. Relying on this yellow earth, they finally drove away the enemy with planes and cannons. This is just a test of the deeply latent power, and this same power will build China into an advanced country in the modern world. When I see and come into contact with this power, how can I not bow my head? I learned this point on my trip to Shijiazhuang, so after returning, I gave two lectures at Tsinghua and Normal University entitled "The Power of the People," because this was a major event for me.

    I am willing to bow my head, but after all, I am still an intellectual from the old era. Once the arrogant mentality is struck down, I immediately become flustered, feeling that I am good for nothing, dreaming of a "magical" transformation, like turning stone into gold, instantly becoming a new person. This unrealistic, non-materialistic attitude pushes me into a state of distress. This is perhaps what is commonly called "having emotional problems." I had planned to join the southward work team, planning this, planning that, giving full play to the imagination that intellectuals do not lack. Time and energy are consumed in fantasies, without analyzing objective conditions, and the result is naturally nothing is accomplished, so I feel even more that I am good for nothing.

    I am grateful to my friends for pointing out the root cause of my emotional problems. Isn't this still a manifestation of the petty-bourgeois intellectuals' unwillingness to bow their heads? The Chinese society has undergone a revolution, the class relations have changed, and those who are accustomed to standing on the heads of the people are unwilling to recognize this earth-shattering fact and humbly learn. They do not easily seek transformation in content, so they focus on form, change their clothes, and change their dogmas to cope with this new situation. In the past, it was "gilding," now it is "hanging red," but the starting point is the same. They still want to stand on the heads of the people. For this reason, they are anxious, their actions are frivolous, and they "have emotional problems."

    Ideological transformation is a long-term process. People like me, who are already close to forty years old, have been nurtured by the old society, and have worked in the old society for more than ten years. The character of traditional intellectuals must be deeply rooted in the bone marrow. How can it be a miracle to be completely reborn all at once? Even if others add names like democracy and progress, it cannot change this actually existing content. This truth is probably irrefutable.

    After my friends pointed it out, I discovered the difference between being faint-hearted and being open-minded. I was not being open-minded during this period, but faint-hearted. What I called "being good for nothing" was actually just a way of saying that I had "lost all face." I was unwilling. In the past, I spoke eloquently, but now I stammer and cannot speak. Then came the "prayer" mentality, wanting to transform effortlessly. This is not being open-minded. Being open-minded is the foundation of learning, acknowledging reality, and gradually transforming.

    After a struggle, my heart settled down a little, and I decided to transform. But intellectuals are, after all, still intellectuals. Traditional intellectuals are idealistic and non-dialectical. At this turning point, they are always unwilling to look at problems from the perspective of historical development, and this is also true for their own transformation. With a remorseful mentality of being good for nothing, they wish they could erase the past history on the blackboard, and then rewrite it stroke by stroke. History cannot be like this. Regret is useless, repentance is futile, and constantly envying the newborn baby is even more pointless. History is continuous, containing both the living and the dead. Transformation is not rebirth, but the development of the living and the acceleration of the dead. The accumulation of many, many small quantitative changes leads to qualitative changes. Enlightenment refers to the moment of qualitative change, so waiting for enlightenment will never come. It is really not easy for intellectuals to cultivate like farmers, following the laws of nature. If they don't see the results, they become impatient. What's the use of this? Isn't that a waste of time? They can't calm down.

    I went through another period like this, and finally thought I had solved this problem, and my emotions settled down a bit. But another problem arose. The people I came into contact with were all people of my type. Everyone was engaged in transformation, so there was a "transformation competition." The transformation competition was not about striving to take the lead, but about individual competition to be first. If you "progress" faster, you feel stronger than others, and you look down on those who are behind. Perhaps because I was used to taking exams in the exam system, I regarded ideological transformation as "studying abroad." This kind of transformation competition will inevitably lead to emotional problems in personnel matters: to make progress, you must get closer to those who are more progressive, and at the same time, you want to be insulated from those who are backward. In a group, there will always be so-called advanced and backward elements. The result of the transformation competition is the formation of circles and layers of division.

    The so-called advanced elements sometimes cannot help but work with the so-called backward elements, so there is fear that the backward will burden the progress, and the slogan of "dropping the baggage together" arises. "Progress should be worked for, that's right, but if the backward don't work equally hard, aren't the backward taking advantage?" The individualism of intellectuals will also come out in various forms during "transformation," just like the Monkey King.

    It is not difficult to see the roots of other people's individualism when engaging in "competition," but then there is a sense of disgust, and the name "progress" is seen as disgusting. What to do? At this time, the intellectuals' fantasies appear again. "To transform, you have to leave this group and go to the army, go to North China University." This idea is somewhat like the meaning of entering a temple to practice. If everyone around you has been transformed, it will be easier to transform yourself. To put it more nicely: "The objective conditions are not suitable for transformation. After leaving the university, if you go to the factory, and come into contact with the proletariat, it will be easier to transform with half the effort." I also thought this way, always feeling that there was no hope in a group of intellectuals like Tsinghua, so I might as well participate in land reform and go to the countryside, wouldn't I learn faster? This idea is actually derived from the same root as the previous idea. What is the root? Still individualism. Transformation is for oneself, to save oneself.

    I probably spent half a year in this "transformation frenzy," participating in discussion meetings and study meetings. The result? Perhaps, apart from demanding progress, I still haven't touched the edge. Individuals have emotional problems, and groups are clamoring for progress. There is no time to read books and newspapers, because I am busy with meetings. But on the other hand, I began to participate in various affairs within the school, starting with salary evaluation, and then allocating housing, things to be done one by one, and problems to be solved one by one. As I got busy, my emotions changed. My eyes no longer looked at whether I had transformed or not, but asked how the things were done? How can they be done well? Where is the problem? Why are others dissatisfied? What mistakes have I made? What are the objective conditions? These works saved me from vexation. I began to touch objective things and people in concrete problems, and I began to ask what is right to do? Why is it right? Only then did I have to persuade others, and only then did I feel that the transformation and progress of others was a necessary condition for doing things well, and I no longer "competed for transformation." Having done work and having responsibility, I could no longer have the idea of "moving to a better place" for a better transformation environment. Things must be done well, and you are not allowed to walk away and wash your hands. All of this made me feel a lot more grounded. From this experience, I understood one thing: perhaps only in the process of "serving the people" can one really talk about transformation.

    I felt grounded, and it was funny to think back on the past process. But another set of problems arose: things couldn't be done, couldn't be done well, and I couldn't figure out the reason. Subjectively, I wanted to do it well, but what I did was not right. It was useless to blame others for not cooperating and to hate others for not understanding. To find out a reason, I must find a law for the development of a thing, but this is too difficult. Only then did I realize that my theoretical mastery was not enough. Sometimes I thought I understood, but the objective development was not like that, and I committed dogmatism. It was really like a child who had just learned to walk, swaying one step to the side.

    A year has passed, time is really fast. Comparing myself a year ago with myself now, there seem to be some differences. This difference may be said to be the result of learning. Where did this result come from? It seems that it is still the responsibility that society has placed on my shoulders. It's not that I don't want to avoid responsibility. Every time things don't work, there isn't a single time I don't want to avoid it. But when I think of the countless grain carts wriggling in the dark night, silently and continuously transporting their blood and sweat to the front lines, this impression illuminates my cowardice. They are all people, what else can I say? Learn, vitality is latent, this is the living side.

    The baggage of intellectuals is heavy, and traditional thinking is profound. This baggage must be exposed one by one and cleared away. One year, two years, ten years, twenty years, is such a journey, pointing out an ideological root and throwing away a baggage, is taking a step, this journey must be taken step by step, without wings, don't think of flying. As long as you are walking, the journey will still be completed one day. "I no longer want to have miracles," that can be regarded as my harvest this year.

### 我这一年

    我这一年
    费孝通
    一九四九年在我是一个“学习年”。在这一年中看到了多少一生中没有看见过的事，听到了多少一生中没有听到过的事。不但如是，就是平素常见常闻的，在这一年中也显示出了以往没有显示过的意义。一个富于生命的大千世界庄严的在我眼前展开，一切使我低头。
    去年年初，冬尽春来的时际，北平还没有解放，清华园却已摆脱了反动统治。我有机会追随了几位前辈到石家庄去旅行。卡车在不平的公路上驶去，和我们同一方向，远远近近，进行着的是一个个、一丛丛、一行行，绵延不断的队伍。迎面而来的是一车车老乡们赶着粮队，车上插了一面旗，没有枪兵压着；深夜点了灯笼还在前进，远远望去是一行红星。——这印象打动了我，什么印象呢？简单的说：内在自发的一致性。这成千成万的人，无数的动作，交织配合成了一个铁流，一股无比的力量。什么东西把他们交织配合的呢？是从每一个人心头发出来的一致的目标，革命。
    我曾参观过英国海口军舰的行列，也曾目击过大战时非洲盟国空军基地的规模。那时却并没有这次在黄土平原上看粮队时的激动。从前者只能知道力量之巨大，从后者才能明白力量之深厚。这里有着基本的差别，形式和内容的差别。巨大的形式可以僵化不灵，深厚的内容却会发展生长。象我这种没有积极参加过革命行列的知识分子对于潜伏着深厚的活力是昧生的，不熟悉的，甚至是不易理解的，因之，对于历史的发展没有把握，对于人民的翻身也缺乏信心。就在这一点之差，失之千里，使自己过去对世界局面的估计陷入错误。也就是这一点之差，使自己感觉得了不起，大言不惭，自以为秀才闭门而知天下事了。
    低了头，再看在这华北平原上所发生过的事迹，以前所不能相信的“奇迹”，现在却可以觉得必然的了。冀中的地道战听来有如神话，但是在不肯屈服的人民却是家常便饭。我以前对中国工业化是没有信心的，因之写过“小康经济”，我这样想，因为觉得中国国民收入的低微，资本累积不起来，人口又多，生产多少吃多少，技术落后，科学不发达，一切都象是手脚上拖着的锁链。这一套想法归根是在对人民的力量没有信心。没有这个信心，必然会缩手缩脚，自甘落后了。因之，这一次旅行给了我一个当头棒喝。知识分子的缺乏信心，其实只是反映出中国资产阶级的懦弱无能罢了。经过百年来革命斗争锻炼的人们并不是这样的。依靠了这一片黄土，终于把具有飞机大炮的敌人赶走，这只是深厚潜伏着的力量的一个考验，就是这个力量同样会把中国建设成为一个在现代世界中先进的国家。当我看到和接触到这个力量时，我怎能不低头呢？石家庄的旅行我学得了这一点，所以回来之后曾以《人民的力量》为题在清华和师大讲过两次，因为这在我是一件大事。
    我愿意低头了，但是究竟还是个旧时代的知识分子。一旦打击了自大的心理，立刻就惶惑起来，感觉到自己百无是处了，梦想着一种可称为“魔术性”的改造，点石成金似的，一下子变为一个新人。这个不现实的，不唯物的态度，把我又推入苦恼的境地。这也许就是普通所谓“闹情绪”了。我曾打算过加入南下工作团，打算这个，打算那个，发挥知识分子所不缺乏的幻想力。时间，精力就消耗在幻想里，不去分析客观条件，结果自然又是一事无成，于是更觉得自己百无是处。
    感谢朋友们把我闹情绪的根源给点破了。这还不是小资产阶级知识分子不肯低头的表现？中国社会革命了，阶级的关系改变了，惯于站在人民头上的人是不甘心的认这天翻地复的事实，而虚心学习的。他们不很容易在内容上求改造，于是又在形式上着眼，换一套衣装，改一套教条，来应付这个新的局面。以前是“涂金”，现在是“挂红”，出发点是相同的。他还是想站在人民头上。为此，心情焦急，行动轻浮，“闹情绪”。
    思想的改造是长期的，象我这样已经靠近四十岁的人，受到旧社会的薰育，过去十多年来更在旧社会里做过事，传统知识分子的性格必然是深入骨髓，要一下子脱胎换骨，岂非奇事？尽管别人用民主前进等名字加上来，改变不了实际存在的这个内容。这个真理大概是颠扑不破的。
    经朋友们的指点，我发现了心虚和虚心之别。我这一段时期不是虚心而是心虚。自己所谓“百无是处”其实还不是“体面全失”的意思。不甘心也。以往是侃侃而谈，现在是呐呐不能出口。于是随之而来的是“乞灵”心理，不费力的摇身一变了。这不是虚心。虚心才是学习的基础，承认现实，逐步改造。
    经过一番斗争，心定了一些，改造罢。可是知识分子毕竟还是知识分子。传统知识分子是唯心而且是不辩证的。他们在这个转变关头，总是不太肯从历史发展观点来看问题，对于自己的改造也是如此。百无是处的悔恨心理，恨不得把过去历史用粉刷在黑板上擦得干干净净，然后重新一笔一笔写过一道。历史这个东西偏偏不能这样的。恨也无用，悔也徒然，口口声声羡慕新生的婴儿，更有什么是处？历史是绵续的，包含着生的一面，死的一面。改造不是重生，而是发展生的，催促死的。从许多许多微小的量的改变累积到质的改变，顿悟云云是指质变的那一刻的说法，所以等待顿悟是永远不会到的。要知识分子象农夫一样按着自然规律去耕耘真不容易的。看不到结果，心里就不耐烦。这样有什么用处呢？那样又不是白费时间么？沉不住气。
    这样我又经过了一个时期，最后自以为解决了这问题，情绪上安顿了一些。但是问题又来了。我所接触的都是和我一类型的人物。大家在闹改造，于是发生了“改造竞赛”。改造竞赛并不是争取带头，而是个别争先。自己“进步”得快就觉得比别人强，看不起别人落后。大概是以往在考试制度里考惯了，把思想改造也看成了“考留洋”了。这种改造竞赛必然会闹起人事上的情绪：要进步一面就得靠近更进步的，一面又想和落后的绝缘。一个团体中，总免不了有所谓先进和落后之分，改造竞赛的结果，形成了一圈圈，一层层的分裂。
    所谓前进分子当然有时候不能不和所谓落后分子一起做事，于是又发生了怕落后带累了前进，发生了“一起丢包袱”的口号。“前进应当努力，那是不错，但是落后的如果不同样努力，不是落后的沾了光么？”知识分子的个人主义在“改造”中也会钻出来变成各式各样的形状，真是象孙悟空一般。
    在闹“竞赛”时看出别人个人主义根源是不难的，但是接下去却是一种厌恶之感，把“前进”名称看成肉麻。怎么办呢？这时知识分子的幻想又出现了。“要改造就得离开这一群，到部队里去，到华北大学去。”这种想法很有些象修道必须进寺院的意味。四围都是改造了的人，自己也就容易改造了。说得更好听些：“客观条件不适宜于改造。出了大学，到工厂里，接触的都是无产阶级，那时要改造就可以事半功倍。”我也这样想过，总觉得在清华这一类知识分子集团里是没有希望的，爽性去参加土地改革，到农村去，不是学习得可以更快么？这种想法其实和前一种想法是同一根源里出发的。什么根源呢？还是个人主义。改造是为了自己，超度自己。
    我在这种“闹改造”里大概费去了半年，讨论会，学习会都参加了。结果呢？也许除了要求进步之外，还是没有摸着边。个人闹情绪，团体闹进步。看书看报都没有时间，开会忙。但是另一方面我开始参加校内的各种事务，起初是评薪，接下去是分配房屋，一件件事要办，一个个问题要解决。这样一忙，情绪都改变了，眼睛不再看自己改造了没有，而是问事情办得怎样了？怎样才办得好？岔子出在那里？为什么别人不满意？自己犯了什么错误？客观条件怎样？这些工作把我在烦闷里救了出来。我开始在具体问题上接触了客观存在的事和人，我开始要问怎样做才是对？为什么对？这时才要去说服别人，才感觉到别人的改造和进步是把事情办好的必要条件，不再“改造竞赛”了。做了工作，有了责任，也不能再有“迁地为良”的改造环境的想法了。事情是要办好的，不容你想走开洗手。这一切使自己踏实了不少。从这段经验里我明白了一点，也许只有在“为人民服务”的过程，才真的说得上改造。
    踏实是踏实了，想起了过去这一段过程也觉得可笑了。但是却另外发生了一套问题：就是事情办不通，做不好，摸不出道理来。主观上要做得好，但是做出来不对劲。怪别人不合作，讨厌别人思想搞不通，还是没有用。要摸出一个道理来，就必须对一件事的发展找出一个规律，这却太难了。这时才明白自己理论掌握得不够了。有时自己以为明白了，而客观的发展又偏不如此，犯了教条主义。真是扶得东来西又倒，象个刚学走路的孩子，一步一偏的摇摆着。
    一年了，时间是真快。把一年前的自己和现在比比似乎有了若干不同。这一点不同也许可以说是学习的结果。这结果那里来的呢？看来还是社会所压在我肩上的责任。我并不是不想逃避责任，每当事情办不通的时候，没有一次不想逃避的。但是一想起那黑夜里蠕动着的无数粮车，没有声息地，不断的把他们血汗所得，自动的在拉上前线，这个印象，照出了自己的懦弱。都是人民，还有什么话？学习罢，活力是潜伏着的，这是生的一面。
    知识分子的包袱是重的，传统的思想是深刻的，这个包袱是要一个一个暴露出来，加以清除的。一年，二年，十年，二十年，是这样一个路程指出一个思想根源，抛去一个包袱，是走了一步，这路程就得一步一步的走，没有翅膀，不必想飞。只要是在走，路程还是有走完的一天。“不再想有奇迹了”，这就算是我这一年的收获罢。
