    Severely Punish Traitors to the Motherland, Spies, and Saboteurs of Work Stoppages
    Soviet Union Announces Decree Enacting the Death Penalty
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th】TASS, Moscow, 13th: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has promulgated a decree on the application of the death penalty to traitors to the motherland, spies, and saboteurs of work stoppages. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has received submissions from the various Union Republics, trade unions, peasant organizations, and leaders of the cultural sphere, stating that the decree abolishing the death penalty needs to be amended so that this decree does not apply to traitors to the motherland, spies, and saboteurs of work stoppages. In view of this, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has decided as follows:
    (1) As an exception to the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of May 26, 1947, abolishing the death penalty, the death penalty may be applied to traitors to the motherland, spies, and saboteurs of work stoppages as the supreme measure of punishment.
    (2) This decree shall come into force on the date of its promulgation.
                   Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Shvernik
                          Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Gorkin.

    严惩祖国叛徒、间谍和怠工破坏者
    苏发布施用死刑法令
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团顷发布关于对祖国叛徒、间谍和怠工破坏者施用死刑的法令。苏联最高苏维埃主席团接获各加盟共和国、工会、农民团体以及文化界领袖的意见书，申述废除死刑的法令有加以修改的必要，俾使这一法令不适用于祖国叛徒、间谍和怠工破坏者。苏联最高苏维埃主席团有鉴于此，特决定如下：
    （一）作为苏联最高苏维埃主席团一九四七年五月二十六日废除死刑法令的例外，允许对祖国叛徒、间谍和怠工破坏者施用死刑，作为最高的惩罚措施。
    （二）本法令自发布之日起生效。
                   苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克
                          苏联最高苏维埃主席团秘书高尔金。
                一九五○年一月十二日。莫斯科。克里姆林宫。
