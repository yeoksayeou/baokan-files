The local state power organs of the Soviet Union are called Soviets of Workers' Deputies. Such organs are established in regions, states, autonomous states, national districts, districts, cities, and townships. All these state power organs are elected by the workers of the region, special region, autonomous state, national district, district, city, and township for a term of two years.

The Soviet of Workers' Deputies of the state (and region) leads the remaining local Soviets of Workers' Deputies within its jurisdiction.

The Constitution stipulates the following tasks for all local state power organs: "The Soviets of Workers' Deputies direct the activities of subordinate administrative organs, guarantee the maintenance of state order, guarantee the observance of laws and the protection of citizens' rights, and direct local economic and cultural construction matters, and formulate local budgets." (Article 97) Thus, the basic tasks of all local state power organs are the same. The difference between them lies not in the tasks themselves, but in the scope of their work. The work of the representatives of local state power organs is to ensure the success of the struggle for harvest, for the completion of the national economic plan, for the improvement of the people's welfare, for the development of culture, and for the consolidation of national defense. Active elements among the people are created around each local organ, and they assist the daily work of the Soviets. The more such active elements there are, the smoother the work of the local state power organs will be.

The structure of the Soviet local state power organs, although diverse in form, is of the same type. Each local state power organ, whether it is the Soviet of Workers' Deputies of the state (region), district, city, or township, elects its own executive committee, including a chairman, vice-chairman, secretary, and several members. In villages and township Soviets with small populations, only a chairman, vice-chairman, and secretary are elected. The task of the executive organ of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies is to lead cultural and political, economic construction matters within its jurisdiction in accordance with the decisions of the corresponding Soviet of Workers' Deputies and the instructions of higher-level state power organs and state management organs. The working procedures of the local Soviets, like the higher-level organ—the Supreme Soviet—are to hold regular meetings. According to the constitutions of the various Union republics, the plenary meetings of city and township Soviets shall be convened no less than twice a month, district Soviets no less than six times a year, and state and regional Soviets no less than four times a year.

The Soviet of Workers' Deputies, within the rights conferred by the laws of the Soviet Union, the Union republics, and the autonomous republics, passes resolutions and issues orders. The higher-level Soviet of Workers' Deputies may repeal the decisions and orders of the lower-level Soviets and their executive organs. However, the executive committee of the higher-level Soviet can only repeal the decisions and orders of the lower-level executive committee. And the higher-level executive committee can only suspend the resolutions and orders of the lower-level Soviet, but cannot repeal them. This is one of the many manifestations of the true democracy of the organizational system and activities of the Soviet state power organs.

The Soviets of Workers' Deputies of regions (states), districts, and cities have the following departments or divisions: finance, national education, health care, social insurance, commerce, and a series of other departments or divisions, but no planning committees. These departments or divisions are also local subordinate organs of the corresponding ministries or other central administrative organs of the government.

In each Soviet, standing committees of various administrative departments, such as national education, public economy, and rural economy, are composed of its representatives. They ensure the supervision of the work of the various departments of the Soviet, investigate the situation of corresponding economic sectors or cultural activities within the jurisdiction of the Soviet, prepare materials for the Soviet to draft decisions, consider various proposals for improving work, etc.

The Soviet of Workers' Deputies is the plenipotentiary organ of state power, with broad powers, and attracts the masses of the people to participate in state work. The activities of the representatives in the local power organs have unfolded infinitely broad leading role. From the practical experience of advanced Soviets (city or township Soviets), it can be seen that the work they have done in various departments is of great importance. Such city Soviets as Moscow, Leningrad, and Stalingrad have already left brilliant achievements in the history of the Soviet Union. These Soviets, during the Great Patriotic War, under extremely difficult conditions, were models of caring for people, and models of successfully defending their own cities, and therefore, successfully defending the country. The Soviets in the front-line areas provided comprehensive assistance to the army and residents, rescued socialist property, and transferred it to safe places. The Soviets have gloriously withstood the strict test of the war, showing themselves to be viable, powerful organs, experienced mass organizers and leaders who are close to the masses and closely connected with them. During the war, the basic work of the Soviet local Soviets was to evacuate residents and resettle them. The local Soviets did a lot of work in expanding the arable land in the rear to compensate for the production of agricultural areas temporarily occupied by the enemy. They ensured the normal operation of evacuated factories and institutions, and promoted the construction of new defense enterprises.

Even in the post-war period, the Soviet local Soviets have shouldered important tasks. In the areas that the enemy had been to, it was necessary to guarantee the housing of millions of homeless people, to restore and establish a large number of enterprises, to expand the school network, to adjust the supply of all the necessities of life for the residents, to develop local industry and Soviet commerce, and to achieve an increase in harvest volume by organizing agricultural work well and consolidating labor discipline. To build the cities and villages of the Soviet Union more beautiful and prosperous than before the war. In order to complete all these tasks, the local Soviets relied on the help of the masses and the spirit of social initiative.

The experience of the first few years after the end of the war showed that the Soviet local Soviets were successfully carrying out various complex tasks in the post-war period. This demonstrates that the democracy of Soviet socialism has the power to overcome everything, and it guarantees that the workers can directly and decisively participate in the management of state affairs.

The re-election of the local Soviets of the various Union republics in December 1947 and January 1948 further consolidated the Soviets. During the election campaign, the work of all local power organs was subject to an inspection. The electors, in the capacity of masters, assessed the work of each Soviet, and assessed the work of the representatives of the Soviet they had elected in the past. The electors' valuable instructions on the shortcomings that occurred in this or that local Soviet greatly helped to promote the backward parts of the work. The elections of local power organs added many new political cadres to the local power organs, and these political cadres were selected by the electors from among the most qualified workers in the cities and villages. Criticism and self-criticism are the laws of the Soviet Union's movement forward. The close and constant contact between each Soviet power organ and the people, and the unfolding of criticism and self-criticism, guarantees the timely elimination and continuous improvement of shortcomings in the work of all state organs.

    苏联的地方国家政权机关
    苏联的地方政权机关，叫做劳动者代表苏维埃，凡边区、州、自治州、民族区、区、市、乡都设有这样的机关。所有这些国家政权机关，都是由边区、特别区、自治州、民族区、区、市、乡的劳动者选举出来的，任期两年。
    州（及边区）劳动者代表苏维埃领导本辖区内其余地方劳动者代表苏维埃。
    宪法规定一切地方政权机关的任务如下：“劳动者代表苏维埃，领导所属行政机关之活动，保证国家秩序之维持，保证法律之遵守及公民权利之维护，领导当地经济及文化的建设事宜，制定地方预算。”（第九十七条）这样，一切地方政权机关的基本任务，都是一样的。它们彼此不同的地方，不在于任务上，而是在工作的范围上。地方政权机关代表们的工作，是在保证为收获、为完成国民经济计划、为提高群众福利、发展文化、巩固国防而斗争的成功。在每一个地方机关的周围，造成了人民当中的积极分子，他们协助苏维埃的日常工作。这种积极分子越多，则地方政权机关的工作也越顺利。
    苏联地方政权机关的结构，虽然形式多样，但都是同一类型的。每一地方政权机关，无论州（边区）的、区的、市的或乡的劳动者代表苏维埃，都选举自己的一个执行委员会，包括主席、副主席、秘书及委员多人。在人口不多的村及乡苏维埃里，仅选举主席、副主席及秘书各一人。劳动者代表苏维埃执行机关的任务，是根据相当劳动者代表苏维埃的决定及上级国家政权机关和国家管理机关的指示，在本辖区内领导文化和政治的、经济的建设事宜。地方苏维埃的工作程序，也和上级机关——最高苏维埃一样，是定期开会的，依照各加盟共和国的宪法，市及乡苏维埃全体会议之召开，每月不得少于两次，区苏维埃，每年不得少于六次，州及边区苏维埃每年不得少于四次。
    劳动者代表苏维埃，在苏联、加盟共和国及自治共和国法律所赋予的权利以内，通过决定并颁发命令。上级劳动者代表苏维埃，得废止下级苏维埃及其执行机关的决定及命令。但上级苏维埃的执行委员会，仅能废止下级执委会的决定和命令。而上级执委会仅得停止下级苏维埃的决议及命令，但不能废止之。这是苏联国家政权机关组织制度及活动之真正民主主义的许多表现之一。
    边区（州）、区、市劳动者代表苏维埃，分设以下各厅或司：财务、国民教育、保健、社会保险、商业及其他一系列厅或司并没有计划委员会。这些厅或司同时也都是政府相当的部或其他中央行政机关之地方下级机关。
    每个苏维埃里，由其代表组成各个行政部门的常设委员会，如国民教育、公用经济、乡村经济等。它们保证对苏维埃各厅工作的监督，调查本苏维埃辖区内相适应经济部门或文化活动之状况，准备苏维埃起草决定的材料，考虑改进工作之各种提案等。
    劳动者代表苏维埃是国家政权的全权机关，具有广泛的权力，并吸引人民群众参加国家工作。地方政权机关中的代表的活动，展开了无限广阔的带头作用。从先进苏维埃（市或乡苏维埃）的实际经验中，可以看出他们在各部门内所作的工作有很大的重要性。这样的城市苏维埃，如莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯大林格勒，已经在苏联的历史上留下辉煌的功绩。这些苏维埃在卫国战争时期，在极端困难的条件下面，都是关怀人的模范，都是顺利地保卫自己城市，因之，也就是顺利地保卫全国的模范。前线地带的苏维埃，都对军队及居民作了全面的帮助，救出了社会主义的财产，把它们转运到安全地方。各苏维埃都光荣地经受了战争之严格考验，显示自己是有生活能力的、强大的机关，接近群众、与群众密切联系的老练的群众组织者及领导者。在战争时期，苏联地方苏维埃所负的基本工作，是撤退居民及安置他们。地方苏维埃为了补偿临时被敌人所占领的农业地区的生产品，在扩大后方耕地的工作上，作了很多工作。它们保证了撤退的工厂和机关之正常工作，促进了新的国防企业之建设。
    就是在战后时期，苏联地方苏维埃也负了重大的任务。在敌人到过的地方，要保证千百万无家可归的人们之住所，要恢复及建立大量企业，要扩展学校网，要调整居民的一切需要品的源源供给，要发展地方工业及苏维埃商业，要用很好地组织农业工作及巩固劳动纪律的方法，达到收获量的增加。要把苏联的城市和乡村建设得比战前还要美丽而富足。为了完成所有这些任务，地方苏维埃便是依赖群众的帮助，依赖社会的倡导精神。
    战争结束后最初数年的经验表明，苏联地方苏维埃顺利地执行着战后时期各种复杂的任务。这表现苏维埃社会主义的民主主义具有战胜一切的力量，它保证劳动者能直接并有决定意义地参加管理国家的事情。
    一九四七年十二月及一九四八年一月各加盟共和国地方苏维埃的改选，更加巩固了苏维埃。在选举运动过程中，一切地方政权机关的工作都受了一次检查。选举人以主人的资格估计了每个苏维埃的工作，估计了过去他们所选举的这个苏维埃代表们的工作。选举人对于这个或那个地方苏维埃发生的缺点之有价值的指示，大大地帮助推动了工作之落后部分。地方政权机关的选举，给地方政权机关中增添了许多新的政治干部，这些政治干部都是选举人从城市和乡村中最称职的劳动者中间选拔出来的。批评及自我批评是苏联向前运动的法则。苏联每个政权机关和人民密切而不断的联系及批评和自我批评的展开，保证了一切国家机关工作中缺点之及时铲除和不断改善。
