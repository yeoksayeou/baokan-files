    Correcting the "Light Tax" Thought of Industrialists and Businessmen
    Qian Jiaju
            (I)
    1950 has begun. In order to support the front lines, guarantee the supply for the revolutionary war, overcome the current financial difficulties, and implement the 1950 budget to achieve the complete victory of the People's Liberation War, and finally wipe out the remnants of the Chiang bandits in Tibet, Hainan Island, and Taiwan; at the same time, in order to ensure the relative stability of prices this year and restore and heal the economic wounds of the war, in addition to enthusiastically purchasing victory bonds to accomplish the task, we must also strengthen tax work so that this year's tax revenue can complete or even exceed the tasks stipulated in the 1950 budget. Therefore, an incorrect concept must be corrected, namely, the "light tax" thought of industrialists and businessmen; an untrue propaganda should be refuted, namely, the belief that industrial and commercial taxes are too heavy, which hinders the recovery and development of production. This article specifically discusses whether the burden on industry and commerce is too heavy and whether it affects the development of private industry and commerce, in order to consult with domestic industrialists and businessmen.
    According to Article 40 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the tax policy stipulates: "The state's tax policy should be based on the principle of ensuring the supply of the revolutionary war, taking into account the recovery and development of production and the needs of national construction, simplifying the tax system, and implementing reasonable burdens." In the 1950 budget, public grain income accounts for 41.4 percent, and various tax revenues account for 38.9 percent. The former is agricultural tax revenue, and the latter is industrial and commercial tax revenue. The total of the two accounts for 80.3 percent. This is the total task that industrial and agricultural taxes should achieve in 1950. Industrialists and businessmen across the country not only unanimously supported the Common Program passed by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, but also expressed enthusiastic support for the 1950 budget plan. If we cannot complete the tax revenue task of the 1950 budget plan, then the inevitable result will be either problems in supporting the front lines and restoring production, or an increase in the government's deficit finance, forcing it to rely on currency issuance, leading to soaring prices and severely impacting the economic life of the broad masses of people. On the other hand, even if our financial tasks are achieved, but the tax burden is indeed so heavy that many productions cannot continue or recover, then it violates the principle of "taking into account the recovery and development of production and the needs of national construction" in the Common Program. Now we must study the big question of whether today's urban tax revenue is really too heavy and whether industry and commerce can afford it.
            (II)
    The industrial and commercial tax revenue we are talking about in this article mainly includes the tax burden of all industry and commerce. It can be said that the People's Liberation Army mainly relied on the countryside in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year People's Liberation War. Therefore, the burden on farmers is far greater than the burden on urban industrialists and businessmen. Even with the current situation, public grain income accounts for 41.4 percent of the 1950 budget revenue, while industrial and commercial taxes (including various taxes such as customs duties, salt taxes, and commodity taxes) account for only 38.9 percent of the total revenue. Today, the burden on farmers cannot be said to be quite heavy. The burden on farmers in the old liberated areas is about 21 percent of the total agricultural income, and about 18 percent in the newly liberated areas, averaging about 20 percent, and the war support burden is not included. In order to improve farmers' production enthusiasm and restore their purchasing power, it is necessary to appropriately balance the urban and rural burdens and make the burdens on urban industrialists and businessmen and farmers reasonable. In this people's revolutionary war, the contribution of farmers is far greater than that of urban industry and commerce. Even the industrialists and businessmen themselves admit this. Is it heavy or not is a matter of comparison. Is the tax burden on industry and commerce heavier than that on farmers today? Obviously this is not the case. On the contrary, the burden on farmers is far greater than that on industrialists and businessmen. This is one point. Secondly, in urban tax revenue, a large part is still transferred to the burden of farmers. For example, customs duties, salt taxes, commodity taxes, and all taxes with a consumer nature are mostly transferred. Taking salt tax as an example, salt tax is almost a poll tax, which is well known. In the future, we must reduce or even abolish salt tax; but today we still have to rely on this backward tax. But who bears the salt tax? Isn't the largest part farmers? (The rural population accounts for 85 percent of the total population, which means that 85 percent of the salt tax is borne by farmers.) Therefore, in form, urban tax revenue accounts for 38 percent of the total revenue, but in essence, a large part of this 38 percent of urban tax revenue is borne by farmers.
    Second, in terms of various urban taxes, commodity tax ranks first today. Commodity tax mainly includes tobacco, alcohol, cotton yarn, wheat flour, cement, matches, fur, etc. Under the New Democratic system, this commodity tax has the effect of regulating production and consumption. For example, tobacco and alcohol are non-essential consumer goods, and the tax should be heavy, because this has the meaning of "prohibition in taxation." In fact, our tobacco and alcohol tax rates can be said to be the lightest in the world. The highest tax rate for tobacco is no more than 120 percent, and the highest tax rate for alcohol is no more than 100 percent, which is really too low compared to the tobacco and alcohol taxes in capitalist countries. Then there is "industrial and commercial tax," which ranks second. It is levied by combining the business tax and profit-seeking enterprise income tax of the Kuomintang government era. Its tax rules take into account the role and status of various economies in the national economy. For example, state-owned railways, post offices, telecommunications, banks, military industries, and state-owned monopolies, and non-profit undertakings are all exempt from taxation; other state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises must also bear industrial and commercial tax. There are separate tax reduction regulations for cooperatives. As for private enterprises, the policy of industry being lighter than commerce is also adopted, but not all industry is lighter than commerce. In industry, the manufacturing of production tools is distinguished from the manufacturing of consumer goods, and the tax burden is differentiated between necessities of life, non-necessities, and luxury goods. Industries that have special benefits for the national economy and people's livelihood are all subject to tax reduction measures, such as machinery manufacturing, mining and metallurgy, vehicle and ship manufacturing, electrical equipment industry, agricultural tool manufacturing, etc., which are separately stipulated to reduce or exempt a certain percentage. In commerce, sectors that are urgently needed by the national economy, such as export goods, export commerce, and the publishing and transportation industries, also have tax reduction regulations. This is fully in line with the principle of "taking into account the recovery and development of production" in the Common Program. Therefore, if some industrialists and businessmen believe that the tax rate of a certain industry is too heavy, it may indicate that this industry should bear a heavier tax burden. The current industrial and commercial tax rates, calculated based on turnover, are levied at 1 to 3 percent of the total business income or 4 percent of the profit amount. Calculated based on income, it ranges from 5 percent to 30 percent. Generally, it is not heavier than the tax rates of the Kuomintang reactionary government era. Why didn't everyone feel it was heavy in the Kuomintang era, but today they feel it is heavy? Some people say that in the Kuomintang era, they could make false accounts, report more less, and conceal tax evasion. As long as they colluded with the tax officials, it would be perfunctorily passed. But now all of this is not working. The style of the People's Government is that one is one and two is two. The old accounts have been handed over, and it is useless to give gifts and plead for leniency. This is indeed the fact, but this is precisely the new atmosphere of the new China, which is a good atmosphere worth celebrating. This cannot be the reason for us to demand tax reduction or exemption.
            (III)
    Is it true that industries and businesses in various places have closed down due to excessive tax burdens? This is completely unfounded. I don't know about the situation in other places, but in Beijing, the capital, for a year, from the early days of liberation to the present, Beijing's private industry and commerce are moving in the direction of recovery and development. Although due to the different specific conditions of various industries, some have developed, some have recovered, some have maintained the status quo, and some have declined. But these are all in line with our basic policy of developing the people's economy, that is, to develop what should be developed and to decline what should be declined. For example, taking the first category of industries that have developed, the industries that have developed in Beijing after liberation include machinery and iron industry, weaving and dyeing industry, machine dyeing industry, flour industry, and rubber industry. These industries are all industries of necessities of life, and their current production has exceeded the production level of 1948. The knitting industry and the soap-making industry had great development before May, began to decline after June, and began to recover again in September and October. Now they still exceed the number of factories and workers in 1948. The second category is industries that have recovered, including paper making, matches, and leather making. Although the number of factories in these three categories has increased compared with 1948, the output and sales have not exceeded, which can only be regarded as being on the road to recovery. The last type is industries whose production has declined, including foreign wine, soda, and carpets. Taking the foreign wine industry as an example, the production capacity of wine is only 3 percent, and the sales volume is only one-half of that in 1948. The sales volume of draft beer is only one-tenth of that of the previous year. The sales volume of cooked beer is better, but it is not as good as that of the previous year. The annual output of the soda industry is only 19 percent of its production capacity, a decrease of two-thirds compared with the previous year. The production volume of the carpet industry has also decreased. However, foreign wine and soda are not necessities of life, and the market for carpets is overseas. Currently, due to transportation difficulties, sales are sluggish. It must be pointed out that the reason why the output of these three industries has shrunk is not due to the excessive tax burden. On the contrary, foreign wine and soda are due to the fact that fewer people drink them than before, and social habits have been advocating thrift since liberation. Carpets are affected by the overseas market. This has nothing to do with taxation. This development trend of Beijing's industry is in line with our economic policy, and the decline in the production of several non-essential daily necessities is not due to the excessive tax burden. It can be seen that saying that production has declined due to excessive industrial and commercial taxes is completely unfounded.
    In terms of commerce, we admit that some shops in Beijing may have applied for closure this year, but there are also many that have applied for opening. A few merchants are still not very clear about the People's Government's industrial and commercial policy, especially seeing that the trade company has opened a department store, they think that maybe the government wants to compete with merchants for business. Recently, I met someone who runs a Western medicine store and asked me if the government is also going to open a People's Western Medicine Store, and whether the government is going to use competition to make private stores unable to exist, thereby implementing socialism. I said, this is completely a misunderstanding of the merchants. The reason why the trade company opens department stores is mainly to regulate supply and demand, stabilize prices, and prevent consumers from being excessively exploited by speculators. In the past, because the government did not have its own retail outlets, even if it had large quantities of materials in its hands, it could not directly reach consumers. Government materials had to go through intermediaries. For example, when prices in Beijing fluctuated in November, there was a big difference between the trade company's listed price of grain and the market retail price, because of the exploitation of intermediaries. To avoid this excessive intermediate exploitation, on the one hand, it is necessary to organize cooperatives, and on the other hand, the government must have its own outlets and run department stores, selling directly in the market. This is the main significance of the government opening department stores. Today, the People's Government's policy is definitely not to compete with the people for profits, let alone to seize the business of merchants, thereby defeating merchants and implementing socialism. This kind of concern of merchants is completely unnecessary, and we should explain this kind of ideological concern to merchants as much as possible.
            (IV)
    At present, the War of Liberation is still continuing, and the largest expenditure on finance is still the military expenditure for the revolutionary war; the second is the investment in production and construction. In order to support the front lines, restore production, overcome the current financial difficulties, and realize the 1950 budget, it is necessary to strengthen tax work, and the industrial and commercial circles must completely abandon the "light tax" concept. It is unreasonable for the industrial and commercial circles to demand "light tax" today. If they demand to reduce the burden on industry and commerce, it is tantamount to demanding to increase the burden on farmers again. The burden on farmers in the eight years of the War of Resistance and the three years of the People's Liberation War has been far heavier than that of urban industrialists and businessmen. This was the case in the past, and it is still the case today. It is unreasonable to ask farmers to increase their burden again. Industrialists and businessmen must realize that today's government is the people's own government, and national capitalists are the masters of the new China. Our burden for the country is also our burden for ourselves. Therefore, we should not demand to reduce the burden, but only demand how to make this tax burden fair and reasonable, that is, how to implement "reasonable burden." If the tax burden is unreasonable, unfair, and the tax officials collect taxes outside the law, opinions can be put forward to request the People's Government to improve, and the People's Government will be happy to receive criticisms and correct deviations. But if it is the tax burden within the scope of one's duty, industrialists and businessmen should actively pay it, and regard it as an honor to complete the task. The concept of light tax is not acceptable today. In the process of building a new China, we also require industrialists and businessmen to contribute all their strength to accumulate funds for national construction, so that China can steadily transform from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrialized country.

    纠正工商业家的“轻税”思想
    千家驹
            （一）
    一九五○年已经开始了，为了支援前线，保证革命战争供给，克服当前财政困难，贯彻一九五○年概算，以达到完成人民解放战争的彻底胜利，最后把西藏、海南岛、台湾的蒋匪残余肃清；同时为了保证今年物价的相当稳定，恢复和医治战争中的经济创伤，我们除了踊跃购买胜利公债达成任务之外，还必须加强税务工作，使今年的税收能完成甚至超过一九五○年概算中所规定的任务。因此，有一个不正确的观念必须纠正，即工商业家的“轻税”思想；有一种不合事实的宣传应该驳斥，即认为工商业税太重，而使生产的恢复与发展发生困难。本文特就工商业负担是否过重，有没有影响私营工商业的发展问题加以论述，以就教于国内之工商业家。
    按人民政协共同纲领第四十条上，关于税收政策规定：“国家的税收政策，应以保障革命战争供给，照顾生产的恢复和发展及国家建设的需要为原则，简化税制，实行合理负担。”在一九五○年的收支概算上，公粮收入占百分之四一·四，各项税收占百分三八·九，前者为农业税收入，后者为工商业税收入，两者合计占百分之八十·三。这就是一九五○年工农业税所应该达到总的任务。全国工商家不但一致拥护人民政协所通过的共同纲领，而且对于一九五○年概算案，也曾表示热烈的拥护。假使我们不能完成一九五○年概算案的税收任务，那么，其必然的结果便是或者使支援前线及恢复生产工作的进行上发生问题，或者使得政府赤字财政增大，不得不倚赖通货发行，以致物价飞涨，广大人民经济生活受到严重打击。另一方面，假如我们的财政任务虽然达到了，但税收负担过重的确使许多生产不能继续或恢复，那么它就违反了共同纲领上“照顾生产的恢复及国家建设的需要”这一原则。现在我们就要研究一下今城市税收是不是真正过重以及工商业能不能负担的大问题。
            （二）
    本文我们所说的工商业税收，主要地是包括一切工商业的税收负担而言。可以说一句，人民解放军在八年抗日战争和三年人民解放战争中主要依靠农村，因此农民的负担是远超过都市工商业者的负担的。即以目前的情况来说，公粮收入占一九五○年概算收入的百分之四一·四，工商业税（包括各项税收如关税、盐税、货物税等在内）仅占总收入百分之三八·九。现在农民的负担不能不说是相当重的，老解放区农民负担约当农业总收入百分之二一，新解放区约当百分之十八，平均为百分之二十左右，而战勤负担尚不在内。为了提高农民的生产情绪及恢复他们的购买力，必须适当的平衡城乡负担，使城市工商业者与农民负担趋于合理。这次在人民革命战争中农民的贡献远大过于城市工商业，这一点连工商业家自己也是承认的，重不重这是比较的问题，难道今天工商业的税负比农民还要重吗？显然这不是事实。相反的，农民的负担远超过工商业者此其一。其次，在城市税收中，有一大部分还是会转嫁给农民负担的，例如关税、盐税、货物税，以及一切具有消费性质的课税，大部分都是转嫁的，就以盐税来说，盐税差不多就是一种人头税，这是人所周知的，在将来我们一定要减轻，甚至取消盐税；但是今天我们却还是不能不倚赖这种落后的税收。然而负担盐税的是什么人呢？最大部分还不是农民吗？（农村人口占全人口百分之八十五，即说明盐税八十五为农民负担。）所以在形式上，城市税收虽占总收入百分之三十八，而实质上这百分之三十八的城市税收中还有一大部分是由农民来负担的。
    第二、以城市各种税收来说，货物税在今天占第一位，货物税主要地包括烟、酒、棉纱、麦粉、水泥、火柴、皮毛等而言，这种货物税在新民主主义制度下有调节生产与消费的效能。例如烟与酒，这是一种非民生必需品，税应该重，因这有“寓禁于征”的意义在内。事实上，我们的烟酒税率在世界各国来说，也许可以说是最轻的。烟类税率最高不过百分之一百二十，酒税最高不过百分之百，这比之于资本主义国家的烟酒税来，实在可以说是太低了。再以“工商业税”来说，“工商业税”占第二位，它是合并国民党政府时代的营业税及营利事业所得税而征课的。它的税则依各种经济在国民经济中的作用与地位而分别加以照顾，例如国营铁路、邮政、电讯、银行、军事工业、国家专卖事业，非营利事业是全部免征的；其它国营的工商业则亦须负担工商业税。对于合作社另有减征的规定。至于私人企业，亦采工轻于商的政策，但并不是所有的工都轻于商。在工业中又分别制造生产工具的工业与制造消费资料的工业，分别生活必需品、非必需品、及奢侈品等等而差别其税负。凡对国计民生有特殊利益的工业都定有减税的办法，例如机器制造业、矿冶业、车船制造业、电工器材业、农具制造业等等，都分别规定减免百分之若干。在商业中凡为国民经济所迫切需要的部门，例如出口货物，出口商业，以及出版业、运输业，也有减税的规定。这是完全符合共同纲领“照顾生产的恢复和发展”这一原则的。因此，如果有的工商业家认为某种行业税率过重，那也许就表明这种行业是应该负担税收较重的。现在的工商业税税率，依营业额计算的，按营业总收入百分之一至百分之三，或收益额百分之四计征。依所得额计算的，自百分之五起至百分之三十。它一般的并不重于国民党反动政府时代的税率。为什么大家在国民党时代并不觉得重，而今天会感到重呢？有人说，在国民党时代他们可以造假账，以多报少，隐瞒漏税，只要与税收人员勾结，就马马虎虎过去了。而现在这一切都不灵了，人民政府的作风是说一是一，说二是二，后账是交出来了，送礼讲情也不行了。这确是事实，但这正是新中国的新气象，这是值得我们庆贺的好气象，这决不能成为我们要求减税免税的理由。
            （三）
    是不是各地的工商业真因税负太重而有倒闭关门的现象呢？这是完全没有事实根据的。别处的情形我不知道，单以首都北京来讲，一年以来，自解放初期到现在，北京的私营工商业正循着恢复与发展的方向迈进。虽然由于各个行业的具体条件不同，有的发展了，有的恢复了，有的维持现状，也有的走下坡路。但这都是合乎我们发展人民经济的基本方针的，即应该发展的发展，应该没落的没落。例如以第一类发展了的行业来说，北京解放后发展了的行业有机器铁工业、织染业、机器染业、面粉业、橡胶业，这几门行业都是民生必需品工业，目前生产都已超过了一九四八年的生产水平。针织业与造胰业，五月份以前有很大发展，六月份以后开始下降，九、十月份又开始恢复，现在仍超过一九四八年的厂数和工人数。第二类是恢复了的行业，有造纸、火柴、制革三种，这三类行业厂数虽比一九四八年增加，但产量与销量都没有超出，这只能算是正在恢复途中。最后一种则是生产下降的行业，这包括了洋酒、汽水、地毯三种，以洋酒业来说，葡萄酒只当生产能力百分之三，销量也只占一九四八年的二分之一。生啤酒销量仅及前年十分之一，熟啤酒较好，但销量也不及前年。汽水业全年产量只当生产能力百分之十九，比前年减少了三分之二。地毯业的生产量也减少。但是洋酒与汽水都不是生活必需品，地毯的市场在海外，目前因交通困难，销路不振。必须指出的是这三种行业产量之所以萎缩，没有一种是由于税负太重的结果，相反的，洋酒与汽水是由于饮用的人比以前减少了，社会习惯自解放后崇向俭朴。地毯则是受了海外市场的影响。这与税收都毫不相干。北京工业的这种发展趋势是与我们的经济政策相吻合的，何况几种非民生日用必需的工业生产之下降，也不是由于税负的太重。可见说什么由于工商业税过重而使生产衰落是完全没有事实根据的。
    再以商业来说，我们承认今年年内北京申请歇业的店铺可能有一些，但申请开业的也不少。少数商人今天还不十分明了人民政府的工商业政策，特别是看到贸易公司开设了一个百货商店，他们以为也许政府要与商人抢生意。最近我便遇到有开西药行的问起我是不是政府也要开人民西药行，是不是政府要用竞争的方法使私人商店无法存在，由此来实行社会主义。我说，这完全是商人的一种误会。贸易公司的所以开百货商店，主要地是要调剂供需，稳定物价，使消费者免受投机商人的过度剥削。过去政府因为自己没有零售的门市部，即令手中掌握着大宗物资，但不可能直接达到消费者之手。政府的物资，非经过中间商人不可。例如当十一月间北京物价波动时，贸易公司粮食的牌价与市场零售价相差很大，即因为有中间商人的剥削。要避免这种过度的中间剥削，一方面便是要组织合作社，另方面便是政府自己要有门市部，要办百货商店，直接在市场上售出，政府开百货商店的主要意义在此。今天人民政府的方针决不是要与民争利，更不是要抢商人的生意，借此来打倒商人，实行社会主义。商人这种顾虑完全是不必要的，这种思想顾虑我们应该对商人尽量解释。
            （四）
    目前解放战争仍在继续进行，财政上的最大开支仍为革命战争的军事费用；其次是生产建设的投资，为了支援前线，恢复生产，克服当前财政困难，实现一九五○年概算，必须加强税务工作，工商界必须彻底放弃“轻税”观念。工商界今天要求“轻税”是不合理的，如果要求减轻工商业的负担，那就无异要求再增加农民的负担。抗战八年和人民解放战争三年中农民的负担已经远比城市工商业家为重，过去如此，一直到今天还是如此，如果再要求农民加重负担是不近情理的。工商业者必须认识今天的政府是人民自己的政府，民族资本家是新中国的主人翁，我们为国家负担，也就是为自己负担。所以我们不应该要求减轻负担，而只能要求如何使这种税负公平合理，即如何实行“合理负担”。假如税负欠合理，欠公平，以及税收人员法外征收，那是可以提出意见，要求人民政府改善，人民政府一定乐于接收批评，纠正偏向的。但如果是本份之内的税负，工商业家就应该踊跃缴纳，以完成任务为荣。轻税观念今天是要不得的，在新中国建设过程中，我们还要求工商业者拿出一切的力量来，积累国家建设的资金，这才能使中国由一个落后的农业国稳步地变成为一个先进的工业化的国家。
