    [Shanghai News] The Shanghai Branch of the China Science Workers Association held its 1950 annual meeting at Jiaotong University on the 22nd. Wang Daohan, Director of the East China Industrial Department, Tang Shouyu, Director of the Higher Education Department, and more than 500 guests and members attended. Director Tang Shouyu addressed the meeting, hoping that scientific workers would contribute their science and technology to the construction of the new China. Liu Bao, a representative of the American Branch of the China Science Workers Association, reported that although the American members are under the oppression of the reactionary American government, thanks to the struggle of the members, the number of members has increased and the association's affairs are developing. The meeting passed a draft of the association's constitution consisting of twenty-five articles. The constitution states that the purpose of the association is to unite natural science workers in Shanghai and its vicinity based on the general association's guidelines, to follow the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and to devote themselves to the construction of the new China and the new Shanghai. Gao Xiaochong, in his report on the draft of the 1950 work plan, pointed out that the association has been liberated from the oppression and persecution of the Kuomintang reactionary government, and the number of members has now expanded six or seven times compared to before liberation, from more than 260 to more than 1,600. The meeting passed the 1950 work plan draft, which mainly includes: developing members in a planned manner, organizing scientific workers to integrate with practical production, further exchanging technical experience with factory workers, jointly holding academic symposiums and lectures with other academic groups, and engaging in self-reform, etc. Three temporary motions were also passed: First, to pay tribute to Chairman Mao in the name of the conference and report that the Shanghai Branch of the China Association of Science and Technology Workers has grown stronger; second, to express serious protest against the British imperialists' prohibition of the activities of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Branch of the China Association of Science and Technology Workers; and third, to call on all Chinese science and technology workers, and even science and technology workers around the world, not to work for warmongers. Finally, Minister Wang Daohan reported on the East China region's 1950 industrial construction plan, hoping that the Science Association would call on science and technology workers to go to Shandong, the Northeast, and North China to serve and work hard for the construction of the new China.
