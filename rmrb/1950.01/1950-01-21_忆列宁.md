    Remembering Lenin
    Translated by Zhang Quanmin
    I Saw Lenin
    Martin Andersen Nexø (Old Danish Writer)
    I only saw Lenin once, during the Comintern Congress at the Kremlin in the autumn of 1922. At that time, it was impossible to understand the full scale of Lenin's undertaking—the October Revolution...

    Now, Lenin's cause has grown and encompasses everything. There is no event of any significance to mankind that is not associated with Lenin and the revolution. Today's world is trembling in a life-and-death struggle, and the future is being born in pain.

    ...He knew with unwavering confidence that victory was coming, and he clearly saw the road to victory.

    This is what distinguished him from the many clear-minded, broad, and diverse representatives at the meeting. This could be felt in his entire ordinary appearance, which was completely unlike the commonly imagined appearance of a great thinker, and it was also reflected in his speech. When Lenin spoke about the most important issues of humanity, when he clearly pointed out to everyone how the future was inevitably and firmly developing from the present, his thoughts were as clear and thorough as flowing water. It was as if he lived the life of all mankind. He knew the situation in all countries, the fate of poor farmers, and the methods of exploitation applied in each country. He showed us how these methods developed, right up to the present. This was a science, but a unique and new science: it had no bookish smell, but was life itself, illuminating the fate of industrial workers, coolies, seamstresses, and street sweepers. The history of mankind, the history of human culture itself, appeared before us in Lenin's words.

    Creator of a New Social System
    Theodore Dreiser (Late American Writer)
    This was a man whose entire life and all his thoughts were devoted to the scientific exploration and the struggle for the best social system. He finally obtained the greatest possibility that the apostles of progress (the title of Jesus' twelve disciples - translator) ever had—the possibility of leading a great nation.

    ...Not only must the old, tyrannical government be overthrown, but also, the human and financial resources must be found among the masses in this country to establish a social system that is just and, at the same time, practically feasible... The Russian people, liberated by Lenin, will never allow themselves to be enslaved again. They are imbued with the spirit of Lenin, and they are fighting. I have no doubt about the outcome of this struggle.

    ...Lenin and his Russia, the humanity and justice he brought into state governance, will ultimately triumph. Because, although Lenin is not among the living, he, with the social system he created and which his comrades and successors have since led to today's strength, will never disappear for future generations.

    The Greatest Statesman
    George Bernard Shaw (Great British Writer)
    ...The British newspapers defamed Lenin even more than they defamed George Washington in 1780; the British government spent 100 million pounds to aid Lenin's enemies. At this time, I was honored to congratulate Lenin as the greatest statesman in Europe in the inscription I sent to Lenin in one of my books. …

    Genius Helmsman
    Romain Rolland (Late French Writer)
    Lenin particularly attracts me. In this century of Europe, I do not know of a second such great figure.

    He held the helm of his will firmly and powerfully, across the raging waves of the human ocean. His indelible mark will be seen for many years to come. He sailed his ship, raising all the sails, through all the storms, to greet the new world.

    Lenin is one of the greatest men and one of the most selfless men in the cause of our century.

    Dedicated to the Immortal Leader
    Maurice Thorez (General Secretary of the French Communist Party)
    Like the revolutionary fighters of our generation, I am infinitely grateful to Lenin. His thoughts, so profound and so precise, are always understood by the proletariat. I often read passages from "State and Revolution" and "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder" to French workers. They were often surprised by the power of his words and exclaimed in praise: "How beautiful this is! How clear this is!"

    The content of Lenin's works is so rich that you can often find new motivations for thinking within them. Questions of events and policies are always illuminated with new light. Without studying "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," how can one learn to overcome the obstacles encountered in the development of the Western revolutionary movement? Leninism is the theory of the victorious proletarian revolution…

    ...Lenin, that is the tireless call to revolution.

    Lenin, that is the strategy and tactics of the revolutionary proletariat, that is the alliance with the peasant masses and colonial peoples.

    Lenin, that is the revolutionary party tempered in the great class battles, that is the vanguard of the working class armed with the progressive theory of leading the working class to victory.

    Follow the Instructions of Lenin and Stalin
    Dolores Ibárruri (Leader of the Spanish Communist Party)
    We should use the theories of Marx and Engels as our compass, and we should follow the instructions of Lenin and Stalin. Lenin and Stalin are the continuators of the doctrines of Marx and Engels. They are good at realizing the doctrines of Marx and Engels in practice, turning them into real life.

    We are Leninists, because, as our great Stalin said, Lenin "...was and is the most reliable and thorough student of Marx and Engels, and he is completely based on the principles of Marxism."

    We are Stalinists, because Stalin enriched the great theories of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. Stalin taught us communists to stand firm even in the most difficult situations, to have Stalinist calmness in struggle and work, to be irreconcilable to class enemies and revolutionary traitors, while not being afraid of difficulties, and to distinguish between united friends and enemies, even if they wear the cloak of friendship. In addition, Comrade Stalin taught us to integrate theory with practice. ……

    "...If theory is not linked with revolutionary practice, then theory becomes empty theory. Similarly, if practice does not illuminate its path with revolutionary theory, then practice becomes blind practice."

    Comrade Stalin, relying on this great truth, following the path of the great theorists of socialism, was able to consolidate all the achievements of socialism with a very good constitution. This constitution proclaimed the right to work and welfare for all working people, and it pointed out to the working people where the essence of true democracy lies and what the road to true democracy is. To be a student of Stalin and an executor of Stalin's policies is the glory of every proletarian, the glory of every revolutionary, as long as he is willing to be a loyal defender of the interests of his class.

    ...We are Stalinists, and we are proud of it, because Stalin's policy is the path to consolidating socialism and overthrowing capitalism.

专栏：

    忆列宁
    张全民译
    我看见了列宁
    马丁·安得生·涅克索（丹麦老作家）
    我只看见过一次列宁，是在一九二二年秋天在克里姆宫中共产国际大会的时期。那时，还不可能了解列宁事业——十月革命的全部广大的规模……
    现在，列宁的事业长成了，并包括了一切。没有一件对人类稍为重大的事件，不是与列宁和革命相关联着的。今天的世界，正在生死的斗争中战栗着，未来正在痛苦中诞生着。
    ……他以不可动摇的信心知道，胜利即将到来，他清楚地看见了到达胜利之路。
    这就是，在有不少清晰智慧的、广大而纷杂的代表会议中使他与众不同的地方。这在他整个平凡的外貌里可以感觉出来，他的外貌完全不像普通所想像的伟大思想家的外貌那样，这在他的说话上也反映了出来。在列宁讲到人类的最重大的问题的时候，在他对每个都明晰地指出从现在不可避免地和坚定地发展着未来的时候，他的思想像水流一样，明晰而透彻。好像，他过着全人类的生活。他知道一切国家的形势、知道贫农们的命运和应用于每一个国家的剥削方法，他给我们指出，这些方法怎样发展起来，一直到现在。这是一种科学，但却是一种独特的和新的科学：它没有书本的气味，而是生活本身，它照明了产业工人、苦力、缝纫妇和清道夫的命运。人类的历史，人类文化历史的本身，由列宁的言辞中出现在我们的面前。
    新社会制度的创造者
    修德尔·德勒塞尔（美国已故老作家）
    这是一个人，他的全部生命和全部思想，都贡献给科学的探索和争取最好的社会制度的斗争了，他最后获得了进步的使徒（耶稣十二弟子的称号——译者）曾经所有的那最伟大的可能性——领导巨大的国家的可能性。
    ……不仅须要推翻旧的、暴君政体，而且，须要在这个国度里的群众中找出人力和财力，来建立这样的一个社会制度，这个社会制度是公正的，而同时又是实践上可以实现的……被列宁所解放了的俄罗斯人民，从不会允许使他再变成奴隶了。他们浸透着列宁的精神，他们在战斗着。这个斗争的结局，我是不怀疑的。
    ……列宁与他的俄罗斯，他带入国家治理中的人道和正义，终究要胜利的。因为，虽然在活人中间没有列宁，但是，他以创造的并由他的战友和继承者从那时起，引向今日强盛的社会制度，对未来的一代将永不会消失的。
    最伟大的政治家
    萧伯纳（英国大作家）
    ……英国的报纸对于列宁的诽谤，甚至超过了一七八○年对于乔治·华盛顿的诽谤；英国的政府曾耗费了一亿英镑去援助列宁的敌人，在这个时候，我很荣幸，我在我送给列宁的我的一本书的题词中，祝贺列宁是欧洲的最伟大的政治家。……
    天才的舵手
    罗曼罗兰（法国已故大作家）
    列宁特别地使我向往。在这一个世纪的欧洲，我不知道有第二个这样伟大的人物。
    他确信地和有力地撑着自己意志的舵，横过那人类大洋的狂涛，他那不可磨灭的痕迹，在漫长的岁月里，都将会看见的。他驾驶着自己的船，挂起所有的帆，通过一切暴风雨，迎接新的世界。
    列宁是我们这一世纪事业的一个最伟大的人和一个最大公无私的人。
    献给不朽的领袖
    莫里斯·多列士（法共总书记）
    如同我们这一代的革命战士们一样，我无限地感激列宁。他那如此深邃又如此精确的思想，总是为无产阶级所理解的。我常常给法国的工人们读《国家与革命》和《在共产主义运动中的“左派”幼稚病》两书中个别的地方。他们时常因他的言辞的力量而吃惊，而出声赞叹：“这是多么美丽啊！这是多么清楚啊！”
    列宁著作的内容是如此的丰富，你经常在其中可以找到对思考的新的动机，事件和政策的问题总是用新的光芒照耀着。如果不研究《在共产主义运动中的“左派”幼稚病》一书，如何学会克服西方革命运动之发展所遭遇的阻碍？列宁主义，这就是胜利的无产阶级革命的理论……
    ……列宁，这就是对革命的不疲倦的号召。
    列宁，这就是革命的无产阶级的战略与战术，这就是与农民群众和殖民地民族的联盟。
    列宁，这就是在巨大的阶级战斗中锻炼出来的革命党，这就是以领导工人阶级走向胜利的进步理论所武装的工人阶级之先锋队。
    遵循列宁和斯大林的指示
    伊巴露莉（西共领袖）
    我们应当以马克思、恩格斯的理论为南针，我们应当遵循列宁和斯大林的指示。列、斯是马、恩学说的继续者，他们善于在实践中实现马、恩的学说，把它变为现实的生活。
    我们是列宁主义者，因为像我们伟大的斯大林所说的，列宁“……曾经和现在都是马克思和恩格斯的最可靠而彻底的学生，他是完完全全地依据于马克思主义的原则的。”
    我们是斯大林主义者，因为斯大林丰富了马克思、恩格斯、列宁的伟大理论，斯大林教导我们共产党人，甚至在最困难的形势下都要屹立不动，在斗争中和工作中要有斯大林式的镇定，对于阶级敌人和革命叛徒要不可调和，而同时要不怕困难，要分清团结的朋友和敌人，虽然他们穿上友谊的外衣。此外，斯大林同志教导我们，要把理论与实践接合起来。…………
    “……如果理论不与革命的实际联系起来，则理论就变成为空洞的理论，同样，实践没有用革命的理论照明自己的道路，则实践就变成为盲目的实践。”
    斯大林同志依靠这个伟大的真理，循着社会主义伟大理论家的道路，能以很好的宪法巩固了社会主义的一切成就，在这个宪法中宣布了所有劳动人民的劳动权和福利，这部宪法给劳动人民指明了真正民主之本质是在什么地方，走向真正民主的道路是什么。作一个斯大林的学生和斯大林政策的执行者，这是每一个无产者的光荣，每一个革命者的光荣，只要他愿意成为自己阶级利益的忠诚保卫者。
    ……我们是斯大林主义者，并以此而骄傲，因为，斯大林的政策，这是走向巩固社会主义和推翻资本主义的道路。
