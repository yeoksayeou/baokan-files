Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 11th: The Greek royalist fascist Tsaldaris-Venizelos cabinet collapsed on the 5th as a result of internal strife. According to a United Press report, with the "election" of the Athens parliament approaching, Tsaldaris' People's Party and Venizelos' Liberal Party disagreed on how to divide future seats. Venizelos led the Liberal Party ministers in resigning en masse, forcing Prime Minister Diomedes to also submit his resignation. The Greek puppet king Paul pulled out another royalist fascist, Speaker Theotokis, and cobbled together a temporary "caretaker cabinet" on the 6th. However, because the three major parties in parliament expressed opposition and failed to obtain a "vote of confidence," he ordered the dissolution of parliament on the 7th and announced that an "election" would be held on February 19th.

According to a Telegraph Agency report, US imperialism has long been dissatisfied with the politicians of the royalist fascist cabinet and wanted to appoint the fascist army commander-in-chief, Papaegos, instead. However, the disgraced Tsaldaris was unwilling to concede and recently, in his campaign speeches, launched a large-scale attack on Papaegos. Papaegos also announced his resignation on the 5th to show his opposition, but after Theotokis came to power, he withdrew his resignation. Another reason for US imperialism's determination to replace its lackey in Athens is that it sees that Tsaldaris has aroused extreme hatred among the Greek people and is no longer suitable as a tool to control Greece, and wants to disguise the Greek puppet government as "democratic" in order to ease popular resistance.

    美帝撤换雅典走狗
    曹达利斯内阁倒台
    【新华社北京十一日电】希腊保皇法西斯曹达利斯——维尼兹洛斯内阁，由于内部互相倾轧的结果，已于五日宣告倒台。据合众社讯：雅典议会“选举”期近，曹达利斯人民党和维尼兹洛斯自由党对未来席位分赃不均。维尼兹洛斯率领自由党部长一齐辞职，迫使总理狄奥米第斯也提出辞呈。希腊傀儡国王保罗拉出另一保皇法西斯分子议长席奥托基斯，于六日拼凑组成临时性的“看守内阁”。但因议会三大党都表示反对，无法取得“信任票”，遂于七日下令解散议会，并宣布二月十九日举行“选举”。
    据电通社报道，美帝国主义久已不满保皇法西斯内阁的政客，想另外起用法西斯军总司令贝贝格斯。但失宠的曹达利斯并不甘心退让，最近在竞选演说中，大肆攻击贝贝格斯。贝贝格斯也于五日声称辞职以示对抗，而于席奥托基斯上台后，又撤销了辞呈。美帝国主义决心调换雅典走狗的另一原因，是看到曹达利斯所引起希腊人民的极度憎恨，不适于再作控制希腊的工具，而想给希腊傀儡政府伪装“民主”，以期缓和人民的反抗。
