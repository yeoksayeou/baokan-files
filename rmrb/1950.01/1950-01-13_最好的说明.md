    The Best Explanation
    Teacher's College Affiliated High School, No. 1 Department, Cui Yongchang
    Natural science is subordinate to politics. If anyone still doubts this point, then there are now two very good explanations: one is the news of the Soviet trial of Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals, and the other is the film "Michurin" that is currently being shown.
    The bacteriological warfare criminals all studied natural science. They studied the laws of bacterial development, but they served fascism, becoming accomplices of the fascists and executioners who slaughtered millions of peaceful people. The natural science they studied did not reduce disasters for mankind; on the contrary, it brought more disasters to mankind. Precisely because their natural science served reactionary politics, science also has a class nature. If someone says that natural science is above class, then the actions of these bacteriological warfare criminals can negate this incorrect view.
    Let's take another look at "Michurin." This film fully demonstrates the relationship between natural science and politics. In the Tsarist era, this great transformer of nature was not only not valued, but also suffered persecution. His orchard was so crowded with fruit trees that it was suffocating, the fruit trees he transformed were treated as illegitimate children, and he did not receive help from the Academy of Sciences because those theorists "serving Mendel" completely ignored this great scientist. Michurin served the people; he loved his motherland; he was not swayed by the money of American capitalists; he knew that the greatest value of his work lay in creating new fruit trees for the people. This is a good education for those "theorists" who are obsessed with publishing papers in foreign journals but are unwilling to study the work in factories. The dark age is over, the proletarian revolution has brought good fortune to Michurin, and the era of Michurin has arrived. His great plan to transform nature has been promoted. In Siberia, on the outskirts of the Arctic Circle, and throughout Russia, the flowers of fruit trees created by Michurin are blooming everywhere. Michurin has brought infinite happiness to mankind. He, along with Lenin, Stalin, and Kalinin, sought happiness for all mankind. His science is truly the science of the people and the science most loved by the people. Therefore, Michurin is immortal in the hearts of the people.
    Natural science is by no means above class! Only when natural science is mastered by the people can it be used for peaceful construction. Atomic energy in the hands of American imperialism can only be used as a weapon to threaten peace, but in the Soviet Union it has already been used to transform nature, turning the boundless barren deserts into fertile fields. This is also a very good explanation.

    最好的说明
    师大附中一部  崔永昌
    自然科学是服从于政治的。如果有人对这一点还怀疑的话，那末现在正有两个很好的说明，一个是苏联审讯日本细菌战犯的新闻，另一个是正在上映的电影《米秋林》。
    细菌战犯都是学自然科学的，他们研究细菌的发展规律，都是为法西斯服务，而成了法西斯的帮凶和屠杀千万和平人民的刽子手。他们研究的自然科学并没有给人类减少灾难，相反的却给人类带来了更多的灾难；正因为他们的自然科学是为反动政治服务的，所以，科学也是有阶级性的。如果有人说自然科学是超阶级的，那么这些细菌战犯们的所作所为，就可以否定这种不正确的观点。
    让我们再来看一下《米秋林》吧，在这部影片里充分的表现出自然科学与政治的关系。在帝俄时代，这位伟大的自然改造者不但不被重视，反而遭受摧残。他的果园被果木挤得透不过气来，他改造出的果木被人以私生子看待，他得不到科学院的帮助，因为那些“服务于孟德尔”的理论家们，完全不重视这位伟大的科学家。米秋林是为人民服务的，他热爱他的祖国，他不被美国资本家的金钱所摇动，他晓得他的工作最大的价值是在于为人民创造出新的果木。这对于那些醉心于要在外国杂志上发表论文而不肯研究工厂中工作的“理论家”们是一个很好的教育。黑暗的时代过去了，无产阶级的革命给米秋林带来了好命运，米秋林的时代来到了。他的伟大的改造自然的计划推广了，在西伯利亚，在北极圈外围，在整个俄罗斯到处开放着米秋林创造的果木的花朵，米秋林他给人类带来了无限的幸福。他跟列宁、斯大林、加里宁一道为全人类谋幸福，他的科学是真正为人民的科学，也是人民最爱戴的科学，因此，米秋林在人民的心中永垂不朽。
    自然科学绝不是超阶级的！自然科学只有为人民所掌握，才能用之于和平建设。原子能在美帝国主义手里只能做为威胁和平的武器，但是在苏联却已经用来改造自然，使无垠的荒瘠的沙漠变成良田。这也是一个很好的说明。
