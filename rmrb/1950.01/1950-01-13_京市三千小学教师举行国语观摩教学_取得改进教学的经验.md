Beijing Three Thousand Elementary School Teachers Hold National Language Demonstration Teaching to Gain Experience in Improving Teaching

[Report from this newspaper] In order to improve the teaching efficiency of elementary school national language teachers and exchange teaching experiences, the Beijing Education Bureau organized city-wide elementary school national language teachers to conduct observation teaching from November 25 to mid-December of last year. A total of 2,719 teachers participated in the observation, visiting demonstration teaching by 85 teachers in 58 schools. Each district generally had plans and leadership to conduct key visits in groups, based on the principle of not hindering normal work. Each teacher grasped the spirit of learning from each other's strengths and pointing out shortcomings, and gained a lot of experience in improving teaching.

		Implement Political and Ideological Education – Must Master Scientific Viewpoints

During the observation, it was found that some teachers still had superstitious and backward views in their teaching. For example, one teacher explained the word "ghost" as "the soul of a dead person"; another teacher explained that the reason why African natives were invaded by capitalist countries was "they don't love labor and don't know how to create"; and another teacher said that Marshall's mediation in China before was "standing on a third-party standpoint." After everyone's discussion, it was clearly recognized that these statements were anti-scientific and inconsistent with objective facts. Therefore, every teacher felt that they must master the scientific viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism in order to teach well.

The main purpose of the national language class is to improve students' cultural level, and at the same time appropriately implement political and ideological education.

In terms of teaching ideology, some teachers have deviations in implementing political and ideological education in national language classes. Some believe that political and ideological education is the task of political classes, and national language teachers can ignore it. Others overemphasize ideological education, only talk about ideological content and not grammar. Still others disregard students' ability to accept it, and talk endlessly to show their "erudition." For example, when a teacher taught the lesson "Strange Characters," he talked about the origin and evolution of Chinese characters all the way to the future Latinization issue. In the study, everyone recognized these deviations and believed that the national language class should mainly improve students' cultural level, teach certain language knowledge, and at the same time, appropriately implement political and ideological education, and pay attention to being suitable for students' level of understanding.

		Must Grasp the Theme of the Text – Connect with Reality Based on Students' Experience

In terms of teaching methods, some teachers fail to grasp the theme of the text. For example, when teaching the lesson "Pulling Up Seedlings to Help Them Grow," the original intention was to say that one cannot be too eager for success in doing things, and must proceed step by step in a realistic manner, otherwise it will only be harmful. However, some teachers focused on talking about the nature and uses of rice and the lives of farmers. Some teachers explain nouns with nouns, such as "vivid – vivid words and gestures are like life," "savings – accumulation and storage," "despise – meaning not to value." When taught in this way, students become more confused as they learn. In connecting with practical teaching, some teachers do not use students' experiences and needs, and use things that students are familiar with as examples to make abstract things concrete, but instead randomly cite examples that are far-fetched. For example, when a teacher was teaching the lesson "Labor and Laziness," he gave an example saying that the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Guilin was the result of hard work. In the use of heuristic teaching, some teachers also use formalistic heuristics, such as asking students questions, not giving students a chance to think, and immediately answering them themselves, which in reality does not enlighten them at all. After everyone discovered these shortcomings, after research and discussion, they realized that this was mainly due to not delving deeply into their work, or sticking to old routines, or not making sufficient preparations before class, and speaking off the cuff during class.

After this observation, every teacher generally felt that their political and professional levels urgently needed to be improved. National language teachers from elementary schools in the Second and Tenth Districts established national language research associations after demonstration teaching, and some people have stepped up their learning and overcome their past conceited ideas. At the same time, they felt that this observation was very helpful to them, and they learned a lot of experience and lessons. The relationship between schools and teachers has also become closer, and everyone further understood that unity, joint research, and exchange of experience are effective methods to improve teaching.

In this teaching demonstration and observation, some individual schools did not fully understand the significance of this work. A certain teacher even came up with a "teaching performance," teaching a lesson in advance to prepare, and then performing it again during the demonstration, regarding the demonstration as a matter of personal gain or loss, losing the original intention of everyone exchanging experience and drawing lessons. In addition, individual districts did not grasp the key points, and did not organize teachers to observe demonstrations with planning and preparation, but were busy visiting all day long, and did not seriously review their work, resulting in delays in work and little effect.

    京市三千小学教师举行国语观摩教学
    取得改进教学的经验
    【本报讯】北京市教育局为提高小学国语课教师的教学效率，交流教学经验，于去年十一月二十五日至十二月中旬组织全市小学国语教师进行观摩教学。参加观摩的教师共二千七百十九人，参观了五十八个学校八十五位教师的示范教学。各区一般都有计划、有领导地分组作重点参观，以不妨碍正常工作的进行为原则；各教师掌握了互相学习优点、指出缺点的精神，获得很多改进教学的经验。
            贯彻政治思想教育  必须掌握科学观点
    在观摩中，发现了一部分教师在教学中还有迷信的、落后的观点，如有的教师把“鬼”字解释为“死人的灵魂”；另一位教师把非洲土人之所以被资本主义国家侵略解释为“他们不爱劳动，不知创造”；又一位教师说：马歇尔以前来华调处是“站在第三者立场上”的。这些说法，经过大家的讨论，明确认识到是反科学的与不符合客观事实的，因此每个教师都感到必须掌握马列主义的科学观点，才能教好。
    国语课的主要目的是提高学生文化水平，同时适当贯穿政治思想教育。
    在教学思想上，一部分教师对国语课中贯彻政治思想教育有偏差。有的认为政治思想教育是政治课的任务，国语教师可以不管；有的则过分强调思想教育，只讲思想内容而不讲文法；有的则不顾学生接受的能力，漫无边际的讲下去以显示自己的“博学”，如一位教师在给学生上“奇怪的文字”一课时，竟从中国文字的起源、演变过程，一直讲到将来的拉丁化问题。在研究中，大家认识了这些偏差，认为国语课主要应是提高学生的文化程度，教给一定的语文知识，同时，适当地贯串政治思想教育，并注意适合学生的理解程度。
            必须抓住课文主题  依据学生经验联系实际
    在教学方法上，有的教师抓不住课文的主题，如教《拔苗助长》一课时，原意本是说：作事情不能急于求成，必须实事求是的按步就班的去作，不然只会有害而无益的，可是有的教师却着重在讲稻的性质、用途和农民生活去了；另一些教师以名词解释名词，如“生动——言姿生动如生也”、“储蓄——积聚储藏也”、“轻视——不重视之意”，这样教给学生，学生越学越不懂；在联系实际教学上，有的教师不是依据学生的经验与需要，以学生所熟知的事物为例证来使抽象的东西具体化，而是牵强附会地乱扯，如一位教师在讲《劳动与懒惰》一课时，竟举例说：人民解放军解放桂林是勤劳的结果；在启发式教学的运用上，有的教师也是形式的启发，如提出问题问学生，不给学生思考的机会，立刻就由教师自己答复了，实际上一点也没有启发。大家发现了这些缺点之后，经研究讨论，认识到这主要是由于没有深入钻研业务，或则墨守老一套，或则课前不作充分准备，上课时信口开河的结果。
    经过这次观摩，每个教师普遍感到自己的政治水平与业务水平亟须提高。二区和十区各小学的国语教师，在示教后分别成立了国语研究会，一部分人已加紧学习，克服了过去自高自大的思想。同时，觉得这次观摩对自己收效很大，学到了不少经验和教训。各学校之间、教师之间的关系也密切了，大家更进一步知道了团结一致，共同研究，交流经验是提高教学的有效方法。
    此次教学示范与观摩中，曾有个别学校对此一工作的意义不大了解，某教师竟来了一次“教学表演”，事先教了一堂作准备，示范时再照演一遍，把示范视为个人的得失荣辱，失去了大家交流经验，吸取教训的原意。另外，个别区没有掌握重点，有计划有准备地组织教师观摩示范，整天忙于参观，没有认真检讨工作，结果耽误工作，收效很少。
