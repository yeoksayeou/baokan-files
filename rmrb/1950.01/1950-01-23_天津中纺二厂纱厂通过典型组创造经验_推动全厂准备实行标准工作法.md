    Tianjin No. 2 Textile Mill Spreads Experience from Model Groups, Promoting Plant-Wide Implementation of Standard Work Methods

    [This Newspaper's News] Tianjin No. 2 Textile Mill is using the experience created by model work groups to promote improvements throughout the plant. They have achieved good results in improving the quality of cotton yarn and reducing waste material consumption, laying the foundation for the comprehensive implementation of standard work methods in the textile factory this year. According to the different work natures of the yarn factory, the model work groups are divided into two categories: maintenance and operation. There are a total of nine model groups in maintenance and more than forty in operation. Some groups were designated by the administration based on their consistently excellent work performance; others were selected by the administration and the trade union through discussion; and still others adopted a rotation system to give everyone the opportunity to be a model group. The basic condition for being selected as a group is consistently excellent work performance. After two months of trial implementation, considerable progress has been made in promoting production:

    (1) After the establishment of model groups in each workshop, certain achievements have been made in maximizing labor power. Comparing the fine yarn model group with non-model groups, the model group can save about 20% of the workforce compared to non-model groups. Taking the factory's Second Yarn Plant as an example, 290 people were used for 100 fine yarn machines in the past, but the model group reduced it to about 210 people. In the past, the cotton opener and scutcher in the First Yarn Plant often operated four machines, which could process more than 18,000 *jin* of raw cotton every ten hours, but it often couldn't meet the needs of the front spinning, and workers often worked overtime. Since the establishment of the model group, under the leadership of the entire cotton opener and scutcher, the work has been very active, and the daily processing of raw cotton has increased to 24,000 *jin*, which not only meets the needs of the front spinning but also has a surplus. The phenomenon of combing and drawing machines stopping due to insufficient supply has disappeared. In the past, cleaning work was sometimes not thorough. Since the establishment of the model group, everyone consciously abides by the work methods. The drawing frame model group of Class B in the First Yarn Plant broke the previous record for the number of machines tended. All drawing frame workers automatically followed the model group, changing from tending sixteen machines to twenty-four machines. The yarn spun ("Hengsi") also increased from 25.7 to over 26. All these are achievements created by improving the awareness of the working class under the leadership of the model group.

    (2) Promoted the standard work method. In order to improve the quality of cotton yarn, the model group emphasized the implementation of the standard work method to lead all workers to improve one step on the existing level. In the past, the cotton laps produced in the Second Yarn Plant's cotton opener and scutcher were uneven in thickness, and several were found every week, which caused serious damage to the steel needle cloth. Later, the maintenance department repaired the machines, and the model group strictly implemented the standard work method, and any unreasonable laps were returned for re-processing, which almost eliminated the damage to the needle cloth.

    (3) Created a new record for reducing waste from cots. A lot of waste from cots in the yarn factory is a big waste. In the past, the waste from cots alone was about 26% of the yarn production per ten hours for each machine (400 spindles). After the establishment of the model group, each class established a cot grouping and statistical system. In November, the waste from cots in the fine yarn model group of Class B in the Second Yarn Plant was only 730 pounds for the whole month. The non-model group reached more than 1,400 pounds. Due to the leadership of the model group, the waste from cots in the entire fine yarn workshop of the Second Yarn Plant was reduced from 400-500 pounds per ten hours in the past to more than 200 pounds, which is half of the previous amount. The amount of cot waste was reduced to about 2% compared to the yarn production per ten hours. The waste from the roving frame model group was also reduced from 30 pounds per day in the past to 7-8 pounds or 2-3 pounds, creating a new record in the history of the Second Yarn Plant, and it is also the biggest achievement since the implementation of the model group in the Second Yarn Plant.

    天津中纺二厂纱厂通过典型组创造经验
    推动全厂准备实行标准工作法
    【本报讯】天津中纺二厂纱厂以典型工作组创造经验，推动全厂，在提高棉纱的品质，减少物料下脚的消耗上获得良好成绩，并为今年全面推行纺织工厂中标准工作法打下了基础。根据纱厂工作性质的不同，典型工作小组分为保全及运转两大类，保全方面一共有九个典型组，运转方面共四十多个。小组有的是由行政方面根据素日工作成绩优良而指定的；有的是由行政、工会经过大家研究和讨论而选举出来的；有的则采取轮流制，使大家都能够有作典型组的机会。当选小组的基本条件都是素日工作成绩优良者。经两个月来的试行，在推进生产上已收到不少成绩：
    （一）各车间典型组成立后，在劳动力的高度发挥上获得了一定的成绩。以细纱典型组与非典型组作比较，典型组较非典型组人数可节省百分之二十左右。以该厂二纱场为例，过去一百部细纱机用二百九十人，典型组则减到二百一十人左右。一场清花间梳打机经常开动四部，每十小时可打原棉一万八千余市斤，但是经常供不上前纺的需要，工人时常加点；自从典型组成立后，整个清花间在典型组的带动下，工作非常积极，每日打原棉已增到二万四千市斤，不但供得上前纺的需要，而且还有富余，过去梳棉并条因供应不足而停车的现象没有了。过去清洁工作有时候很不彻底，自典型组成立后，都自觉的遵守工作法。一纱场乙班并条典型组值车眼数突破了过去原有的纪录，全体并条工都自动向典型组看齐，由原来值车十六眼改为二十四眼，所纺“亨司”也由二十五·七增至二十六个以上。这都是在典型组的带动下，提高了工人阶级的觉悟，创造出来的成绩。
    （二）推动了标准工作法。为提高棉纱品质，典型组强调了实行标准工作法，以带动全体工友在现有的水平上提高一步。过去二场清花间制成的棉卷厚薄不均，一周总要发现几个，使钢丝针布的损失很严重，后来保全方面修理了机器，典型组严格执行了标准工作法，凡不合理的花卷一定退回重打，这样使针布损坏的情况几乎没有了。
    （三）创造减少皮辊花下脚新纪录。纱厂多出皮辊花，是一个很大的浪费。只皮辊花一项，过去每一台车（四○○锭）所出皮辊花为其十小时产纱量的百分之二十六左右。典型组成立后，各班都树立起皮辊的分组统计制度，十一月份二场乙班细纱典型组全月的皮辊花只七百三十磅。非典型组则达一千四百余磅。由于典型组的带动，使二场细纱全车间的皮辊花由过去每十小时四五百磅减少到二百多磅，比过去减少了一倍，皮辊花的出数对其十小时的产纱量作比较也减少到百分之二左右，粗纱典型组回花的出数也由过去每天三十磅减少到七、八磅或二、三磅，创造了二厂有史以来的新纪录，也是二厂实行典型组以来收获成绩最大的一方面。
