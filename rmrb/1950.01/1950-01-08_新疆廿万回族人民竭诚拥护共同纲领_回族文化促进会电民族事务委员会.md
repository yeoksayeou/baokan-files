    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th. The Xinjiang Hui Culture Promotion Association sent a telegram to the Central Ethnic Affairs Commission on the first of last month, expressing its support for the Central People's Government's ethnic policies. The Central Ethnic Affairs Commission has replied, encouraging it to strive for the unity of all ethnic groups and the construction of a new Xinjiang. The telegram stated: "The establishment of your association demonstrates the correctness of the Central People's Government's ethnic policies. We, the 200,000 Hui people of Xinjiang, are determined to wholeheartedly support the ethnic policies of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and strive to complete the revolution to build a great new China." The Central Ethnic Affairs Commission replied on December 29th, stating: "The liberation of Xinjiang not only ended the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in Xinjiang, but also ended the unfortunate situation of disharmony among the various fraternal ethnic groups in Xinjiang, which was historically provoked by the reactionary ruling class. It is hoped that in the future, under the banner of our great people's leader Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the Xinjiang People's Government, we will strengthen the unity of the Hui people and all fraternal ethnic groups in Xinjiang, develop and improve the culture of the Hui people, and strive to build a new Xinjiang."
