Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, January 11th: In the half-year since liberation, Qingdao's women's work has achieved great success in educating female workers, female students, and street working women, organizing production, developing women's cultural education, and running maternal and child welfare programs. Qingdao's female workers, who had long been deceived by the propaganda of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary rule, had many ideological concerns in the early days of liberation, their enthusiasm for production was not high, and they had serious wasteful habits. It was almost a common phenomenon for female workers in various factories to use yarn to wipe sweat, wipe shoes, and use it as menstrual pads. According to statistics from eight China Textile factories, approximately 70 pieces of yarn were wasted each month in the past. After patient education, the female workers' awareness improved, and they began to actively produce and pay attention to conservation with a new labor attitude. The daily cloth production per female worker in China Textile No. 9 Factory increased from 17 yards to 39 yards; the cotton waste of female workers in China Textile No. 5 Factory was reduced from 100 jin to 20 jin per day; and female workers in China Textile No. 9 Factory proposed the implementation of a shift system in workshop management, which made workers responsible for each other, and the storage of machines and parts was greatly improved. Due to the increased awareness of the female workers, they no longer steal public property, and the worker exit inspection system that has long existed in China Textile has also been abolished. Another manifestation of the increased awareness of female workers is their enthusiastic request to be organized. According to statistics, 90% of female workers in various public and private industries in the city have joined the trade union. Many female workers have been elected as chairpersons, members, and group leaders of trade unions, such as Zhang Shilian, chairman of China Textile No. 10 Factory Trade Union, and Yuan Boxiao, vice chairman of the privately-owned Yangben Factory, who are both supported by the workers. In addition, 596 people have joined the Youth League, becoming the core of uniting female workers. In terms of female student work, the Qingdao Women's Federation cooperated with the Youth League's Department of Youth and Women, the Municipal Student Federation, and the Military Control Commission's Department of Culture and Education to carry out female student work. First, study groups and autonomous associations were established in various schools, and many female students participated in the leadership of the above-mentioned organizations. During the summer vacation, some female students were organized to run literacy classes, remedial classes, and night schools for women in various streets. Through political study and participation in social services, they initially established the idea of serving the people. Therefore, some female students asked to go to factories, streets, and rural areas to participate in practical work. At the city-wide student representative conference, female students Liu Zhuo and Lü Changying were elected as chairman and vice-chairman of the Student Federation. At the same time, the Women's Federation organized street working women to participate in work relief programs, such as digging rivers, cleaning streets, digging sewers, and sewing and washing military uniforms, and achieved great results. For example, Liu Guixiang in the Taitung District led a group of 18 people to dig sewers, and they all received first-class wages every day; one district mobilized more than 3,000 people to complete the cotton-padded sewing task of 90,000 sets of military uniforms in 55 days, and discovered more than 400 activists in production. The Municipal Women's Federation has also carried out women's cultural education and welfare work. In the early days of liberation, female workers were organized to participate in large classes and rotational training classes. Later, women's lectures, literacy classes were held, and "New Qingdao Women" and women's textbooks were published. Many female workers and female students now frequently write articles for newspapers and give radio speeches. In order to carry out maternal and child welfare work, under the leadership of the Women's Federation, a childcare committee was established in July, and training courses for childcare workers were opened; a municipal nursery was established, and factory nurseries were researched and improved; and attention was paid to uniting and organizing social maternal and child groups to jointly carry out maternal and child welfare work.

    经半年教育转变浪费积习
    青岛女工提高生产
    十分之九参加工会
    【新华社青岛十一日电】解放半年来的青岛妇女工作，在教育女工、女学生和街道劳动妇女，组织生产，开展妇女文化教育和举办妇婴福利事业等方面获得很大成绩。长期在帝国主义和国民党反动统治欺骗宣传下的青岛女工，在解放初期存在着许多思想顾虑，生产情绪不高，并有严重浪费的积习。各厂女工用纱擦汗、擦鞋、当月经纸垫，几乎是普遍现象。据中纺八个厂统计，过去每月浪费纱约七十余件，经过耐心教育后，女工觉悟提高，开始以新的劳动态度积极生产并注意节约。中纺九厂女工每人每日产布由过去的十七码提高到三十九码；五厂女工并条由过去每日废棉一百斤减少到二十斤；中纺九厂女工提出车间管理实行交班制，使工人互相负责，机器和零件的保管大为改进。由于女工的觉悟提高，不再偷盗公物，中纺长期存在的工人出厂检身制度也就取消了。女工觉悟提高的另一个表现是热烈地要求组织起来。据统计：全市公私各业女工，已有百分之九十参加了工会。不少女工当选为工会主席、委员和小组长等，如中纺十厂工会主席张士莲、私营阳本工厂副主席袁博孝，都得到工人的拥护。另有五百九十六人参加了青年团，成为团结女工的核心。在女学生工作方面，青岛妇联曾配合青年团青妇部、市学联与军管会文教部进行女学生工作，首先在各校建立了学习组、自治会，不少女学生参加了上述组织的领导工作。暑期中并组织了部分女学生到各街道举办妇女识字班、补习班、夜校等，通过政治学习和参加社会服务，初步确立了她们为人民服务的思想。因此有的女学生要求到工厂、街道、农村中去参加实际工作。在全市学生代表大会上，女学生刘卓、吕长英当选为学联正副主席。妇联同时组织街道劳动妇女，以工代赈、参加挖河、清理街道、挖下水道、缝洗军衣等工作，获得很大成绩。如台东区刘桂香领导全组十八人挖下水道，每天都拿到一等工资；有一个区曾发动了三千余人在五十五天中完成了九万套军衣的絮缝任务，并在生产中发现了四百余积极分子。市妇联同时也开展了妇女的文化教育与福利工作。在解放初期曾组织女工参加上大课、轮训班学习，以后又举办了妇女讲座、识字班，刊编了《新青岛妇女》和妇女课本，许多女工、女学生现经常给报纸写稿和作广播讲演。为开展妇婴福利工作，在妇联领导下，七月间成立了保育委员会，开办保育人员训练班；成立市托儿所，研究和改进了工厂托儿所；并注意团结和组织社会妇婴团体，共同开展妇婴福利工作。
