Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 15th -- The Nampo Glass Factory, one of the major industrial construction projects in North Korea's Two-Year People's Economic Construction Plan, was completed at the end of last year. The factory is a five-story steel and concrete building, large in scale, equipped with six melting furnaces each with a melting capacity of 1,300 tons, six electric rolling machines, and six gas furnaces with a daily output of 30,000 cubic meters of gas. During the construction process, thanks to the assistance of Soviet technicians and the high level of enthusiasm and creativity displayed by the workers in overcoming various difficulties, the factory was completed in one year and eight months. Under Japanese rule, such a project would have taken more than three years.

The factory is North Korea's first glass factory and is expected to produce more than 300,000 cases of glass sheets, 1.6 meters wide and 2 millimeters thick, this year. The factory will also include factories producing enamel ironware and glassware. The completion of the factory is an important victory and good news for the Korean people, who have long lacked glass.

    朝鲜北部南浦地区大玻璃厂建成
    今年将生产三十余万箱
    【新华社平壤十五日电】朝鲜二年人民经济建设计划中若干巨大工业建筑之一的南浦玻璃工厂，已于去年末竣工。该厂为五层的钢骨水泥建筑物，规模宏大，装有每次熔量一千三百吨的熔解炉六台、电滚机六台及日产瓦斯三万立方米突的瓦斯炉六座。在建筑过程中，由于苏联技师的帮助，由于工人们发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，克服了各种困难，因而使该厂能在一年八个月内建成。而在日本统治时代，这样的工程将需三年以上的时间。
    该厂是北朝鲜的第一个玻璃工厂，预计今年将生产宽一·六米，厚二毫米的玻璃板三十余万箱。该厂并将附设生产珐琅铁器及玻璃制品的工厂。该厂的建成，对于素来缺少玻璃的朝鲜人民，是一个重要的胜利与佳音。
