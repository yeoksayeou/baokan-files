    Soviet Education Expert Discusses Soviet Worker-Peasant Education

    In 1919, the Soviet Union was in a difficult situation, and Lenin issued an order to eliminate illiteracy. The following year, the All-Russian Illiteracy Elimination Committee was established, with Kalinin as its chairman, and the literacy campaign was launched nationwide.

    After World War II, the world saw the first country without illiteracy—the Soviet Union eradicated illiteracy.

    Simultaneous with literacy education, adult part-time supplementary education with an improving effect was carried out on a large scale.

    To meet the needs of construction, worker schools were opened in major cities to effectively train a large number of worker-peasant cadres who could quickly master technology.

    At the preparatory meeting of the National Education Work Conference, a tall Soviet friend with already graying hair sat quietly, listening very carefully to the reports on the education situation in the major liberated areas of China through an interpreter, and writing from time to time in a notebook with a pencil. This was the Soviet education expert Vilychkovsky, one of the many Soviet experts who came to New China to help with construction.

    New China's education work was just taking its first steps, and many difficulties were encountered in the huge project. The reports on the education situation in various regions reminded Vilychkovsky of the education construction work in the young Soviet Republic after the October Revolution, which had encountered even more difficulties. At that time, all work had to start from scratch, with few footprints of predecessors to follow. However, under the leadership of the great Lenin and Stalin, the direction was clear—everything was for the construction and consolidation of the socialist worker-peasant regime in the Soviet Union, and education work was also carried out under this overall guiding principle. First, worker-peasant education was launched, and at the same time, the old education was transformed with the newly constructed worker-peasant socialist education as the direction, so that it gradually transformed into a new education that met the needs of the working people.

    The young Chinese education construction work will undoubtedly move forward in the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers first, but many unfamiliar and difficult problems have been encountered in formulating many specific implementation steps. Therefore, Vilychkovsky tirelessly participated in group meetings discussing worker-peasant rapid middle schools, the establishment of the Chinese People's University, and the transformation of Beijing Normal University, and provided many specific opinions, and gave a report at the conference on Soviet worker-peasant education and teacher training.

    Building a new type of worker-peasant education is an important agenda item of this education work conference, and it is also a new issue in the construction of new education in China that particularly needs to learn from the Soviet Union. Therefore, Vilychkovsky was very happy to introduce the construction of Soviet worker-peasant education to reporters.

    "One of the backward legacies left to us by Tsarist Russia was that more than half of the country's population was illiterate, especially the workers and peasants, almost more than 90 percent were illiterate." Vilychkovsky sighed deeply, and the memory was obviously very heavy. "At that time, foreign imperialism besieged us, domestic White bandits created rebellions, and rich peasants refused to hand over grain. Our country was in a very difficult situation, but at that time, in 1919, the great Lenin issued a decree to eliminate illiteracy. He said that people who are illiterate have no way to participate in political life, and the working people should learn to manage the regime after they have gained power." Then, in 1920, the All-Russian Illiteracy Elimination Committee was organized, with Kalinin as the chairman. People under the age of 58 had the right and obligation to become literate, and the movement to eliminate illiteracy began to sweep the Soviet land like a storm, from the capital to the remote Siberian frontier, from cities to villages, from agencies to the army, from factories to farms, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, and tens of millions of people were spelling letters and memorizing words one by one year after year and day after day. The initial teaching method—such as the teaching method for children to recognize characters—proved to be unsuitable. Adults have poor memory but strong understanding, and the content they need is reading newspapers, simple pamphlets on industrial and agricultural production, essays, and applied writing. They need to read content related to life. At that time, magazines for eliminating illiteracy in various ethnic languages were published, publishing articles on current affairs, literature and art, and issues related to industry, agriculture, finance, and economics, etc., and widely disseminating them as auxiliary teaching materials. In 1922, the illiteracy rate in the army had been reduced from 65% to 6%; in 1933, more than 90% of the people in the Soviet Union could write and read in their own national language; by the time of World War II, illiteracy in the Soviet Union had disappeared, making it the first country in the world without illiteracy.

    Simultaneous with the worker-peasant literacy education was the adult part-time supplementary education with an improving effect. Factories, agencies, schools, and education departments held a large number of part-time supplementary schools, so that a large number of cadres and workers could study while working. The levels ranged from primary to secondary. The primary level could reach the level of four years of education, and the secondary level could reach the level of seven to ten years of education. Tens of thousands of experts, engineers, teachers, and doctors in the Soviet Union entered such schools to study before entering universities. From 1931, because four-year compulsory education had been universally implemented, primary supplementary schools were abolished. After the outbreak of World War II, many young people dropped out of school due to the war and participated in work and could not enter schools. From 1943, worker youth schools and rural youth schools were established again, enrolling young people working in factories, mines, and collective farms. The curriculum was the same as that of seven-year and ten-year schools, and the time was adjusted according to working hours. There were also exams and promotion and retention systems, and graduates could still enter specialized schools or universities to study.

    Another form of worker-peasant education is worker schools, similar to the worker-peasant middle schools that China is about to hold today.

    Speaking of this, the Soviet friend Arsintsev, who had been the principal of a worker school for many years, happily joined the conversation.

    He said that due to the needs of socialist construction, in addition to ordinary middle schools and part-time supplementary schools training a large number of intellectuals from worker-peasant backgrounds, it was also required to train a large number of worker-peasant cadres who could quickly master science and technology more quickly and effectively. Therefore, worker schools, as preparatory schools for worker-peasant cadres to enter universities, were opened in major cities. The students enrolled were worker-peasant youths who had completed four years of elementary education, and they completed the equivalent of six years of middle school curriculum in three years. After passing the graduation, they were directly sent to universities to continue their studies, so as to train various construction professionals. When recruiting students, advertisements were placed and official letters were sent to local education agencies to ask them to help review the worker-peasant youths who wanted to enroll. Generally, they were youth league members and outstanding labor youths recommended by factories, troops, and rural areas. They were eager to learn and prepared very seriously for the exam. Some youths from remote areas ran directly to the school to ask to study. Some had a cultural level that was a little short of the conditions for applying, and the school set up tutoring classes to solve their difficulties.

    The curriculum of worker schools is different from that of ordinary middle schools. It has been streamlined and reorganized, focusing on basic cultural and scientific courses such as Russian, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, so that many unnecessary subjects can be reduced. The level of teachers is better than that of ordinary middle schools, the treatment is also higher, and the students are adults aged sixteen to thirty-five (most are sixteen to twenty-five), the consciousness of learning is very high, and the understanding is also strong, so it is not very difficult to complete the equivalent of six years of middle school curriculum in three years. They were seen graduating in batches year after year and entering universities. From 1921 to 1936, about 10,000 to 35,000 students graduated each year. These graduates later finished university, some directly engaged in construction, and some continued their studies and became today's various Bolshevik experts.

    苏联教育专家谈苏联工农教育
    一九一九年，苏联正处在困难的境地，列宁发出扫除文盲的命令。第二年，全俄扫除文盲委员会建立，加里宁亲任主席，识字运动在全国展开。
    第二次世界大战之后，全世界出现了第一个没有文盲的国家——苏联文盲绝迹。
    与进行识字教育同时，有着提高作用的成人业余补习教育大规模地开展起来。
    适应建设的需要，工人学校在各大城市开办起来，以有效地培养大批迅速掌握技术的工农干部。
    在全国教育工作会议的预备会上，有一位高高的头发已经苍白的苏联朋友，静静地坐在那里，通过翻译极为用心地倾听着大会关于中国各大解放区教育情况的报告，时时用铅笔在笔记本上写着。这是苏联的教育专家魏力契可夫斯基，是来到新中国帮助建设的许多苏联专家中的一个。
    新中国的教育工作正跨出了第一步，巨大的工程中遭遇到很多的困难，各地区教育情况的报告，使魏力契可夫斯基想起了遭遇过更多困难的十月革命后年轻的苏维埃共和国的教育建设工作的情况。那时候，一切工作都要从头做起，很少前人的足迹可以遵循。但是在伟大的列宁斯大林领导之下，方向是明确的——一切为了建设和巩固社会主义苏联的工农政权，教育工作也在这整个的指导原则下开展起来，首先着手展开工农教育，同时即以新建设的工农的社会主义的教育为方向，进行对于旧教育的改造，使之逐步转化为新的合乎劳动人民需要的教育。
    年轻的中国教育建设工作无疑地将循着首先为工农兵服务的方向前进，但在制订很多具体实施的步骤时遇到了很多的陌生的困难问题，因此，魏力契可夫斯基不倦地参加着讨论工农速成中学、成立中国人民大学、改造北京师范大学等等的小组会，提供了很多具体的意见，并在大会上作了关于苏联工农教育和培养师资的报告。
    建设新型的工农的教育是这次教育工作会议重要的议程之一，也是中国新教育建设方面特别需要向苏联学习的新的问题之一，因此魏力契可夫斯基很高兴向记者介绍苏联工农教育建设的情况。
    “帝俄留给我们的落后的遗产之一就是全国有一半人口以上的文盲，尤其是工农劳动人民，不识字的几乎有百分之九十以上。”魏力契可夫斯基深深地叹了一口气，回忆显然是十分沉重的。“那时候，国外帝国主义围攻着我们，国内白党制造着叛乱，富农拒绝交出粮食，我们的国家处在十分困难的境地，但就在那时，一九一九年，伟大的列宁就发出了扫除文盲的法令，他说不识字的人民是没有办法参加政治生活的，劳动人民获得了政权就应该学会管理政权”。接着一九二○年组织了全俄扫除文盲委员会，由加里宁任主席，五十八岁以下的人民都有识字的权利和义务，扫除文盲的运动就开始像狂风一样席卷着苏维埃大地，从首都到偏僻的西伯利亚的边疆，从城市到乡村，从机关到部队，从工厂到田庄，几万、几十万、几百万、几千万的人在一年年、一天天地一个一个地拼着字母，背着单字。最初的教学法——如教儿童认字一样的教学法被证明是不合适的。成年人的记忆力差，理解力强，需要的内容是阅读报纸，简易的工业农业生产的小册子，小品文和应用文，需要阅读与生活有关的内容。那时出版了各民族文字的扫除文盲的杂志，登载着时事、文艺、有关工农业财政经济等等问题的文章，大量地传布着作为辅助教材。一九二二年时，部队中文盲已由百分之六十五减为百分之六；一九三三年，苏联十分之九以上的人民能用本民族的文字写和读；到第二次世界大战以后，苏联的文盲已经绝迹，这是全世界第一个没有文盲的国家。
    与工农识字教育同时进行的是有着提高作用的成人业余补习教育。各工厂、机关和学校以及教育部门大量地举办业余补习学校，使大批干部、工人一面工作一面学习。其程度有初级的和中级的，初级的可以得到四年制的程度，中级的可以得到七年到十年制的程度，苏联几万的专家、工程师、教师、医师在没有进入高等学校之前是进入那种学校学习的。一九三一年起，因为四年制义务教育已经普遍实行，初等补习学校取消了。第二次世界大战爆发后，因战争关系失学的和参加工作不能进学校的青年很多，一九四三年起又设立了工人青年学校和农村青年学校，招收在工厂、矿山和集体农庄中工作的青年，课程和七年制十年制的学校一样，时间则按照工作时间调整，也举行考试和升留级制度，毕业后一样可以升入专科学校或大学学习。
    工农教育的另一种方式就是与今日中国即将举办的工农中学相仿的工人学校。
    谈到这里，曾经当过好几年工人学校校长的苏联朋友阿尔辛契耶夫高兴地加入谈话了。
    他说由于社会主义建设的需要，除了普通中学、业余补习学校在大量地培养工农出身的知识分子外，还要求能够更快更有效地培养大批能迅速掌握科学技术的工农干部。于是，作为工农干部升入大学的预备学校——工人学校就在各大城市开办起来了。招收的学生对象是读过四年制初等水平的工农青年，在三年内修完相当于六年的中学课程，及格毕业后直接送进大学继续学习，这样来培养各种建设专门人才。招生的时候是一面登广告，一面给各地教育机关去公函请他们帮助负责审核要求入学的工农青年，一般都是工厂部队农村保送的青年团员和优秀的劳动青年，他们迫切地要求学习，十分认真地准备考试，有些边远地区的青年直接跑到学校中来要求学习。有些文化程度还差一点够不上投考的条件，学校设立了补习班为他们解决困难。
    工人学校的课程与普通中学是不同的，经过了精简和重编，重点放在俄文、数学、理化等基础的文化科学课程上，这样可以减少许多不必要的科目。教员的程度比一般普通中学为优良，待遇也较高，学生又都是十六岁到三十五岁（大多数是十六岁到二十五岁）的成年人了，学习的自觉性很高，理解力也强，因此三年完成了相当于六年的中学课程，并没有什么大困难。只见他们一批批一年年的毕业出来，进入大学。从一九二一年起到一九三六年止，每年大约有一万到三万五千的学生毕业。这些毕业生以后又读完大学，有的直接投入建设，有的更继续深造，成为今日的各种布尔什维克的专家。
