The most important condition for Bolshevik leadership
Organizing inspection of work implementation is a correct leadership and an important method for perfect implementation of instructions and plans.

    Our laborers evaluate their achievements in the struggle to complete the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule with the joyful feeling of fulfilling their obligations. The Soviet people are full of confidence in their own strength and in the experienced leadership of the Communist Party. This has aroused a new wave of creativity and labor initiative.
    However, no matter how great the achievements of our motherland, Soviet patriots are not satisfied with the successes achieved. Comrade Stalin taught that one should not be proud or misled by temporary achievements. Where there is arrogance, complacency, and self-esteem, where there is no Bolshevik strictness and self-criticism, then there will be a halt to progress, and stagnation and deterioration of the cause will inevitably be reached. It is the responsibility of all Soviet organs and their leaders to raise Bolshevik strictness, to more broadly unfold criticism and self-criticism, and to not tolerate shortcomings in work. Relying on advanced factors, comprehensively supporting advanced factors; making the achievements of innovators, the model of creative labor, on par with all laborers – this is the law of our life. New and advanced factors are the backbone of all socialist construction fronts.
    The Party of Lenin and Stalin and the Soviet government have always unswervingly helped workers in Soviet state organs to master the Bolshevik style of leadership and to continuously improve it. Our country has flexible and clear working organs, whose cadres are people with the necessary knowledge, infinitely loyal to the cause of the people, and capable of successfully ensuring the completion of the tasks of the Party and the government.
    One of the most important conditions for new achievements in communist construction is to further consolidate the Soviet state, strengthen state organs, improve their work, and strengthen the organizational role of state power organs in completing economic and cultural construction tasks.
    The art of Bolshevik leadership lies first and foremost in foreseeing the difficulties and obstacles that can hinder or inhibit development, and in striving to overcome these difficulties and obstacles in a timely manner, so as to avoid stagnation, eliminate the danger of delay, and ensure victory.
    Comrade Stalin instructed: "When the correct policy is formulated, when the problem is correctly decided, the success of the cause depends on organizational work, depends on the organization to strive for the realization of the Party's policy, depends on the correct selection of personnel and the inspection of the implementation of the decisions of the leading organs... Properly stipulating the inspection of implementation is a searchlight that can help illuminate the situation of the work of the organs at any time and place bureaucrats and bureaucrats in the clear light." Organizing the inspection of implementation is the correct leadership, guaranteeing the completion of the instructions of the Party and the government and achieving the desired results.
    In order for the inspection of implementation to achieve its purpose, it is necessary to make the inspection systematic, not accidental; at the same time, the leaders who need to inspect the work must not be secondary people, but people with full authority—the leaders themselves. They should first, as Lenin required, spend an hour or two every day personally inspecting the staff, "checking their work, digging out the essence, training, teaching them to analyze carefully. Study the staff, look for skilled workers. Now, the point lies in this..."
    The role of checking the implementation and its impact on the success of the cause largely depends on the purposefulness, specificity and practicality of the instruction itself. The program must be clearly formulated in the orders and instructions, the execution period must be determined, and the most accurate responsibilities of each worker in the state organs must be determined. Let them strive to complete certain, clearly depicted tasks and practical work. If this is not the case, then effective supervision and inspection are impossible.
    The inspection of implementation should be carried out after the resolution is passed, and not only in the office based on formal reports, but first of all directly at the work site based on the actual implementation results. Inspection from the top must be combined with inspection from the bottom, and Soviet activists and the broad masses of laborers need to be attracted to participate in this great and important work. The inspection of implementation helps to determine the merits or demerits of an agency, and can expose the ignorant and boastful in a timely manner, who destroy their own cause with arrogant and laudatory promises. Inspection can help to timely propose replacing the boastful and negligent with honest and capable workers. The purpose of inspection is not only to expose shortcomings but also to help correct errors and shortcomings and to prevent them. Lenin emphasized the necessity of checking the affairs of implementation and checking experience.
    Correctly formulated inspection of implementation can improve the sense of responsibility of workers in state organs for the cause entrusted to them, can consolidate state and labor discipline, and educate them in Bolshevik strictness to themselves and to others. Inspection can also timely reveal, disseminate and spread positive experiences, and correctly evaluate all achievements. Where there is a lack of inspection of implementation, the cause will suffer damage, and many forces will be wasted in vain. Here are a few facts that point out what results from neglecting the inspection of implementation and bureaucratic leadership.
    Many enterprises of the Food Industry Department of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic have not completed their tasks for a long time. The Food Industry Department does not clarify the reasons for the backwardness according to the circumstances and help improve the situation, but only indulged in issuing orders and instructions, requiring the leaders of various enterprises to "overcome the backwardness immediately" and "make decisive changes in their work." During the ten months of this year, this department issued nearly seven hundred orders. However, the situation has not improved. What is the benefit of such orders to the cause?
    At a recent meeting of the Saratov Oblast Soviet, representatives launched sharp criticism of the Executive Committee and its departments for neglecting to inspect the implementation. The Public Enterprises Department and the Planning Commission concentrated all their activities on compiling various plans for resolutions and directives, but the fate of these resolutions was rarely of concern to the leaders. This is illustrated by the serious shortcomings in the living facilities of laborers, in the plans for configuring industrial enterprises in various regions, and in the utilization of natural resources within the state.
    The rapid growth of our national economy and culture requires that all Soviet organs and their leaders provide accurate, specific and effective leadership, and unswervingly implement the instructions of the Party and the government. One of the main tasks of the Workers' Deputies Soviet and all state organs is to focus on organizing work and inspecting the implementation of the instructions of the Party and the government. The inspection of implementation must run through all activities of all organs of the Soviet state. It is necessary to resolutely oppose the bureaucratic style of leadership and oppose the stereotyped articles that bind the creative initiative and initiative of the masses. The interests of the cause require this, and the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government require the Soviet organs to do so.

    布尔塞维克领导的最重要的条件
    组织对工作执行情况的检查，是正确的领导，是完满实现指示、计划的重要方法。
    我国的劳动者以执行了义务的愉快心情，来评价自己在争取提前完成战后斯大林五年计划的斗争中的成就。苏维埃人对于自己的力量，对于共产党的有经验的领导，充满了信心。这唤起了他们的创造力和劳动倡导的新高潮。
    但是无论我们祖国的成就多么伟大，苏维埃的爱国者是不安心于所达到的成功的。斯大林同志教导说不能骄傲或为一时成就所惑。那里有自高自大、自满和自尊，那里没有布尔塞维克的严格要求和自我批评；那么那里就停止了继续前进，不可避免地会达到事业的停滞和恶化。一切苏维埃机关及其领导者们的责任，是提高布尔塞维克的严格性，更广泛地展开批评与自我批评，不容许工作中的缺点。依靠先进的因素，全面地支持先进的因素；要使一切劳动者都与创造性劳动的模范即革新者的成就并列—这是我们生活的法则。新的和先进的因素是一切社会主义建设前线的骨干。
    列宁——斯大林的党和苏维埃政府始终不渝地帮助苏维埃国家机关中的工作者们，要掌握布尔塞维克的领导方式并要不断改善它。我国有灵活的、明确的工作机关，其中的干部都是具有必需的知识、无限地忠诚于人民事业的人，是能够成功地保证完成党和政府的任务的人。
    共产主义建设新成就的最重要的条件之一，就是进一步巩固苏维埃国家、健全国家机关、改善其工作，加强国家政权机关在完成经济及文化建设任务中的组织作用。
    布尔塞维克领导的艺术，首先在于预见能妨害或抑制发展的困难与阻碍，能适时地努力克服这些困难与阻碍，以此来免除停滞，铲除迟滞的危险，保证胜利。
    斯大林同志指示说：“当正确的方针制订后，当问题正确地决定了以后，事业的成功就系于组织工作，系于争取实现党的方针的组织，系于正确地选拔人员及检查对领导机关决议的执行……很好地规定对执行的检查——这是一个探照灯，它可以在任何时候帮助照亮了机关工作的情况，并把官僚主义者与事务主义者置于明朗的光芒之下。”组织执行的检查，这就是正确的领导，保证完成党和政府的训令而达到所需的成果。
    为了使执行的检查能达到目的，必需使检查是有系统的，而不是偶然的；同时需要检查工作的领导人不能是次要的人们，而是具有十足职权的人——领导者本人。他们应该首先像列宁所要求的一样，每天要有一小时或二小时去亲自检查工作人员，“检查他们的工作，发掘本质、训练、教导他们认真地剖析。研究工作人员，寻找熟练的工作者。现在，要点即在于此……”
    检查执行情况的作用，其对事业成功的影响，很多都系于训令本身的有目的、具体及切乎实际。在令和指示中必需清楚地制订方案，确定执行的时期，决定国家机关中每个工作者最确切的责任。使他们争取完成一定的、清晰地描画出的任务和实际工作。如果不是这样，那么有效的监督、检查是不可能的。
    执行的检查应该在决议通过之后，同时不仅在办公室依据形式的报告来检查，而首先要直接在工作地点依据实际的执行结果来检查。从上层的检查必需与从下层的检查相结合着，需要吸引苏维埃的积极分子和广大劳动群众参加这伟大而重要的工作。执行的检查有助于确定某机关的功绩或缺点，可以适时地暴露出无知和自夸者，他们以傲慢和赞美的允诺毁坏了切身的事业。检查可以帮助适时地提出以诚实而有能力的工作者来替换自夸和怠慢的人。检查的目的，并不只在于揭露缺点而且还要帮助改正错误及缺点，并预防它们。列宁曾强调对执行情况的事务的检查和经验的检查的必需性。
    正确制定的对执行的检查，可以提高国家机关的工作者对于委托给他们的事业的责任感，能巩固国家的和劳动的纪律，教育他们对自己和对别人的布尔塞维克的严格性。检查还可能适时地揭示，广布和传播肯定的经验，正确地评价一切成就。那里缺乏对执行的检查，那里的事业就蒙受损害，许多力量会白白浪费掉，这里有几件事实，指出了不重视执行的检查和官僚主义的领导会产生什么样的结果。
    阿尔美尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的食品工业部的许多企业，有很长的时间没有完成了任务。食品工业部不按事情的情况阐明落后的原因并帮助改善这种情况，却只迷于公布命令与指示，要求各企业的领导人要“立刻克服落后”，“在工作中做出坚决的变更”。在今年的十个月中间，这个部就颁布了将近七百次命令。但是，情况却没有改善。诸如此类的命令对于事业有什么裨益呢？
    在不久以前召开的萨拉托夫州苏维埃的会议上，代表们对执行委员会及其各部的忽视检查执行状况，展开了尖锐的批评。公营事业部及计划委员会，把一切活动都集中在编制决议和指令的各种方案，而这些决议的命运却很少使领导者们关心。这在劳动者的生活设施中、在配置各区工业企业的计划和运用州内天然富源中的严重缺点，都说明了这件事。
    我国国民经济与文化的飞速高涨，要求一切苏维埃机关及其领导者们确切的、具体的和有效的领导，要不屈不挠地实现党和政府的训令。劳动者代表苏维埃和一切国家机关的主要任务之一，即是要集中注意于组织工作并检查党和政府训令的执行情况。执行的检查，必需贯穿苏维埃国家一切机关的全部活动。应该十分坚决地进行反对官僚主义的领导方式，反对束缚群众创造性倡导和主动性的官样文章。事业的利益要求这样做，布尔塞维克党和苏维埃政府要求苏维埃的机关这样做。
