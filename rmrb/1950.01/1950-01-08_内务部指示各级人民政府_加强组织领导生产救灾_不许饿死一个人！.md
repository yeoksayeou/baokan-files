Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 7th.

The Ministry of Interior of the Central People's Government issued a supplementary instruction on production and disaster relief on the 6th to the Military and Political Committees of the major administrative regions, the People's Governments of all provinces and municipalities, and the administrative offices. The instruction holds responsible: People's governments at all levels must take a high degree of responsibility for disaster relief; no one is allowed to starve to death! If there is a lack of understanding of the disaster situation, no preparation for the spring famine, and no solution when hunger arrives, then they should be punished; on the contrary, they are meritorious servants of the people and should be rewarded.

The instruction points out: Today, the key to disaster relief work lies in strengthening organization and leadership. People's governments at all levels in disaster areas, especially the main responsible persons of higher-level governments, should go to the most severely affected areas as much as possible to inspect and solve problems on the spot to guide the work.

The instruction states: "Going deep into the disaster areas and leading the masses" is not enough to just look and talk in the disaster areas; it is necessary to clearly grasp the disaster situation and carefully study disaster relief methods. If the disaster situation is not grasped adequately: exaggerating it may affect the inappropriate allocation of limited relief grain; minimizing it will inevitably lead to serious phenomena, resulting in a panicked response and failure to rescue in time. This is the first thing to pay attention to in disaster relief work.

The instruction calls on all localities to: mobilize people's mutual assistance. Disaster victims and disaster victims should help each other, disaster victims with labor and those without labor should help each other, those with labor and those with funds should help each other; disaster victims and non-disaster victims should help each other, disaster areas and non-disaster areas should help each other. The instruction states: We do not approve of blindly fleeing famine; however, those who have already fled must be well taken care of everywhere, or allowed to participate in production locally; no one fleeing famine is allowed to starve to death. The relief grain and regulated grain allocated to the provinces and regions must be well managed, correctly distributed, and transported to the regions in a timely manner to play its due role.

The instruction points out: Last year, the drainage and wheat planting in the flooded areas were successful, which is the fundamental solution for disaster relief. This spring, it is necessary to timely mobilize spring plowing and sow early-maturing crops (such as early-maturing potatoes and vegetables). In areas with water accumulation near lakes, mobilize fishing and aquatic product harvesting to prepare for living materials during the period when crops are not yet ripe. Attention should be paid to preserving livestock, repairing farm tools, and accumulating fertilizer to welcome this year's great production campaign. At the same time, emphasize thrift and call for "turning living materials into production capital."

    内务部指示各级人民政府
    加强组织领导生产救灾
    不许饿死一个人！
    要清楚掌握灾情，详确研究救灾方法，正确分配粮食；发动人民互助，劝止盲目逃荒；及时发动春耕，播种早熟作物；强调节约，变生活资料为生产资本。
    【新华社北京七日电】中央人民政府内务部于六日向各大行政区军政委员会、各省市人民政府、行署发出关于生产救灾的补充指示。指示责成：各级人民政府要对救灾负起高度的责任，不许饿死一个人！如有对灾情不了解，对春荒无准备，饥饿来临，毫无办法，那就应受到责罚；反之则是人民的功臣，应受到奖励。
    指示指出：今日救灾工作的关键，在于加强组织与领导。灾区各级人民政府，特别是高级政府主要负责人应尽可能亲到灾情最严重的地区视察，并尽可能就地解决问题，指导工作。
    指示称：“深入灾区、带领群众”，不是到灾区看看讲讲就够，必须清楚地掌握灾情与详确地研究救灾方法。对灾情掌握不够：夸大了，可能影响到有限的救济粮分配不适当；缩小了，必然遇到严重现象发生，就手忙脚乱，挽救不及。这是救灾工作第一要注意的事。
    指示号召各地：发动人民互助。灾民与灾民要互助，灾民中有劳力的与无劳力的要互助，有劳力与有资金的要互助；灾民与非灾民要互助，灾区与非灾区要互助。指示称：我们不赞成盲目逃荒；但已逃出了的人，各地必须好好照顾，或使之就地参加生产，不能允许有一个逃荒的人被饿死。分配各省区的救济粮与调剂粮必须好好掌握，正确地分配与及时地运到各地区，以起到其应有的作用。
    指示指出：去年水灾地区排水种麦做得有成绩，这是救灾的根本办法。今春要及时发动春耕，播种早熟作物（如早熟洋芋及菜蔬等）。对靠湖积水地区发动打鱼捞水产，以备青黄不接时的生活资料。要注意保存牲畜、修理农具、堆积肥料等以迎接今年的大生产运动。同时要强调节约，号召“变生活资料为生产资本”。
