    [Beijing News] Following the train collision at Huaqiying Station under the Jinan Railway Administration, the Ministry of Railways promptly instructed the Jinan Administration to send responsible personnel to investigate and handle the aftermath. Simultaneously, it dispatched Zhen Tao, Deputy Director of the Transportation Bureau, leading an inspection team composed of relevant departments of the Ministry of Railways, to rush to the scene of the accident for investigation. According to reports from the Jinan Railway Administration and Deputy Director Zhen: the primary cause of the accident was that the switchman Wang Jinfa incorrectly set the switch; station staff member Jin Bingyuan, who was guiding the train forward, failed to fulfill his responsibility to check the switch; the deputy stationmaster on duty, Zhou Zhenqing, was ideologically numb and asked station staff member Yao Bingming to substitute for receiving the train, and Yao also failed to confirm the signal; Zhang Bin, the car allocation stationmaster at Pukou Station, did not accept the military's suggestion to place the small cars at the rear of the train; the stationmaster on duty at Puzhen did not notify the crew of train 2404 to meet the train at Huaqiying Station; and Wang Zhen, the dispatcher at Bengbu Dispatching Office, also failed to notify the meeting, all of whom bore responsibility. The collision resulted in the deaths of 16 Second Field Army personnel, 10 seriously injured, and 32 slightly injured. Locomotive 301 and 2404 were damaged; the fourth and fifth cars of 301 were damaged; six cars from the fourth car onwards of 2404 were damaged; and the car bodies of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth small cars were all smashed. After rescue and opening, the delay totaled twelve hours and twenty-nine minutes. Wang Jinfa, Zhou Zhenqing, and Jin Bingyuan (who fled and then returned), the main parties involved in the accident, are in custody awaiting interrogation. After receiving the report, Minister of Railways Teng immediately reported the incident to the Government Administration Council, requested punishment, and decided to give Chen Dafan, Director of the Jinan Railway Administration, Gui Peng, Political Commissar, Niu Zhu, Director of the Transportation Department, and Zhao Guodong, Director of the Bengbu Sub-bureau, each a demerit. The Ministry of Railways has announced this in the Northern and Southern telephone conferences on January 26 and in a circular on January 30, ordering railway authorities across the country to be highly vigilant. In order to thoroughly investigate this incident, the Ministry of Railways dispatched Yan Yusen, Deputy Director of the Personnel Bureau, and Lu Fu, Deputy Director of the Second Department of the People's Supervisory Committee, on January 30 to conduct further investigations on the spot to handle the entire case.
