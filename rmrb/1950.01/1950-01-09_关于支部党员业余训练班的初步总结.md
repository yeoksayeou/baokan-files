    Concerning the Preliminary Summary of the Branch Party Member Spare-Time Training Class
    中共大连市委宣传部 (Propaganda Department of the Dalian Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party)
        I. Work Situation
    Focus on factories, followed by government offices and neighborhood branches. The target audience is new Party members and old Party members who have not received training.

    In July of last year, the Propaganda Department of the Dalian Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party formulated a half-year plan for spare-time training of Party members, determining that the focus of branch education should be on factories, followed by government offices and neighborhood branches. The target audience is new (probationary) Party members and old Party members who have not received training. The content is Party Constitution teaching materials, combined with the current various undesirable tendencies within the Party. Each Party committee, based on its own circumstances, separately organized rotational spare-time training classes for Party members, systematically and with a focus, first training new Party members (probationary) and old Party members who had not been trained in factories, then training all Party members. According to three months of statistics, five districts and six other units organized a total of thirteen classes, with 628 Party members receiving training.

    In addition, the Municipal Propaganda Department holds a monthly short-term spare-time training class. The target audience is general branch and branch propaganda committee members (the third class required branch secretaries and committee members to participate); the purpose is to specifically cultivate branch instructors, improve the branch's own operations, and thereby lay the foundation for carrying out regular branch education work and universally conducting Party member education. In terms of educational content: The focus in July and August was the nature of the Chinese revolution and the communist worldview. September and October focused on the Party Constitution, combined with the current various undesirable tendencies within the Party. Up to the end of September, the Municipal Committee held three classes in three months, with a total of 720 students. The duration was four to six days. The method used a combination of lectures and discussions, and finally, the problems and difficulties raised in the work were answered, good working methods were summarized, and undesirable tendencies in the work were criticized, using theory to guide thinking, analyze the root causes of errors, and make them understand where the work was wrong, how to correct it, and point out the direction.
            II. Main Gains
    Party members have a preliminary understanding of the Party Constitution, have strengthened their production concept, and have transformed the branch's tendency to monopolize everything.

    We adopted the above two methods to carry out Party member education in branches, and the main gains are threefold:

    First, the class consciousness and political understanding of Party members have been improved, a revolutionary worldview has been established, and vague ideas and erroneous understandings have been clarified. Originally, most Party members did not understand the rights and obligations of Party members. After this study, they all had a basic understanding of the Party Constitution and realized the seriousness of the undesirable tendencies within the Party, which have already hindered the progress of the work. For example, in the issue of developing the Party: Due to the existence of closed-doorism, many outstanding workers were rejected, and old technical workers were not developed, only those who could say "nice things" or were "honest fools." For example, worker Dong Yulan of the fishing net factory has been selected as a "first-class meritorious worker" every time, is active in production, studies well, and has high political consciousness, but has not been developed. Gao Wenhai, secretary of the branch of the electrical engineering office of the shipping canal, said: "I didn't want to develop Party members in the past, because I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to control them if I developed too many." In fact, they are afraid of being contradicted, afraid that they will not be able to "get along" after they are developed. After studying, they believe that "these ideas are contrary to the principles of the Party Constitution." Some Party members reviewed their past errors in developing Party members, such as "forcing people to join" and "not being cautious in handling procedures," which violated the provisions of the Party Constitution. They believe that this is the result of not studying and blindly messing around.

    Second, the production concept of Party members has been strengthened, and the relationship between the Party and the masses has been strengthened. For example, Party members of the shipping canal reviewed in their study and said: "In the past, we lacked a production point of view, wasted raw materials, took more than we used, used the good and not the bad, used the new and not the old..." Now they realize that "this is a manifestation of not cherishing state property." The production team leader of the fishing net factory in Xigang District used to be divorced from the masses and unwilling to listen to the opinions of the masses. After studying, he often took newspapers to the team to read to the workers, took the initiative to contact the masses, and helped the masses study. At the same time, the purely technical viewpoint of the old worker Party members in the past was resolved, making them realize the importance of learning. For example, after studying, some old workers immediately moved from their homes to the factory and reviewed the problems they had learned in the training class for twelve days. Jiang Shoumou, an old worker in the麻袋 (ma dai = burlap bag) factory, has been a Party member for three years, but felt that he had not made much progress, was very discouraged, and unwilling to study. After everyone's help, analysis, and criticism, his understanding was greatly improved.

    Third, the bureaucratic style of the branch monopolizing and substituting for everything has been changed. In the past, some branch secretaries turned the branch into a single-leader system, and they had the final say in everything they did. Some had an extreme tendency towards democratization, and one-sidedly believed that everyone had the final say and the leadership could not control it. Both of these tendencies have been criticized, believing that they are "contrary to the principle of democratic centralism stipulated in the Party Constitution." All of these indicate that the Party member training class is an effective organizational form and educational method for improving Party members' political understanding and enthusiasm for production. Therefore, after studying, everyone said with concern: "The training class should be held regularly to increase our working methods and reduce mistakes."
            III. Work Review
    Experience proves that we must unite production and earnestly conduct Party Constitution education. Training classes must be short, small, and精干 (jing gan = efficient and capable), with less but essential content, and should not be procrastinated.

    First, we adopted the basic learning method of combining theory with practice, which not only corrected deviations in the work but also improved the ideological level of Party members. The branch committee members who came to the Municipal Committee to study said: "The training class is short and 精干 (jing gan = efficient and capable), and we can use it when we go back." Comrade Yang (an old worker), a member of the Temple'er溝 (Si'ergou) Oil and Grease Factory branch committee, gave lectures to Party members with vivid examples after studying, which were very popular. The Party members all said that the lectures were good and "cleared up the vague ideas of the past." Some, after short-term training, knew how to do branch work. This educational method of linking work and thinking greatly improved the learning mood of Party members.

    Second, the following problems can be seen from the Party members' self-reflection: A. The phenomenon of insufficient understanding of the Party Constitution is widespread within the Party, and even basic knowledge of the Party is very poor. This is due to careless study. Although Party Constitution education has been carried out in the past, it was a didactic explanation that was divorced from actual work, and learning and application were irrelevant, resulting in serious erroneous tendencies in the work, such as the tendency towards closed-doorism and the tendency to "force people to join" in the issue of developing the Party. Some comrades have become detached from the masses and indifferent to the masses after joining the Party. Some become arrogant and unwilling to work or engage in production after joining the Party. Some are undemocratic and monopolize or 包而不办 (bao er bu ban = take responsibility without handling) the work of the trade union, the Communist Youth League, and the administration. Others have a vague understanding of the Party's production tasks and lack a production concept (such as the Dongjiu branch in Temple'er溝 (Si'ergou) District, which believes that the branch only does the work of developing the Party). The fundamental reason for these deviations is the lack of systematic education in the Party Constitution, or the separation of the Party Constitution education from practice, as well as the bureaucratic style of the leadership not conducting in-depth inspections. B. Judging from the effect of the training class, the method is very important, and the two methods have different effects: one is spare-time collective accommodation, short time (about half a month for one class), less content, and education combined with the branch's thinking. The Party members have a good learning mood, no one is absent from class from beginning to end, and the gains are great. The other method is the opposite, not starting from reality, not taking care of the workers' thoughts, emotions, and health. Some run a class for as long as two months or a month and a half, with as many as a dozen issues, making the workers very tired and unable to digest them, which affects production instead. This method reflects a lack of a clear production concept, a failure to understand that the nature of the spare-time short-term training class is different from that of a Party school that is divorced from production, and a failure to understand that the education of Party members must be carried out around production tasks. Because the basic requirement for Party member education at present is to improve their class consciousness and give play to their enthusiasm for production. Therefore, the training class must strive to be "short, small, and 精干 (jing gan = efficient and capable)," with less content, a focus, concise and to the point, and should not be procrastinated, otherwise it will be greedy to chew more than one can swallow, and the effect will not be great. C. The lecture given by the instructor is the key, and it must be given by a responsible comrade, with sufficient preparation in advance, combined with practice, and talking about the problems existing in actual work and thinking. Because of the temporary and chaotic pull in Zhongshan District, the instructors were not prepared in advance, and the result was that the lectures were incoherent, which affected the learning mood. Therefore, if it is found that students do not like to listen, the lecturer should first check himself.

    Short-term training classes should focus on conducting class education and policy education, and should not put the review of Party members' history here.

    Third, the basic task of the short-term training class is to improve Party members' understanding of the Party, so it should focus on class and policy education. As for self-reflection and review of Party members' history, it should be the regular work of the branch, carried out in daily life and work in contact with the masses. It is not appropriate to put these tasks in the Party training class. The Transportation Company used the reflection on history as a unit to carry out, although there were some gains, but it was not the focus and direction of education.
            IV. Several Suggestions
    First, continue to implement the Municipal Propaganda Department's half-year work plan, systematically carry out political education and class education, with the Party Constitution as the basic education content, and combine it with current actual policy education and cultural education as the guiding principle. Lay the foundation for learning culture and technology next year.

    Second, it must be clearly recognized ideologically that the education of factory branches is for the purpose of developing production, and deviation from this purpose is a bias. Issue of the target audience: Xigang District clearly stated in this study: "Since factories are engaged in production, and the main force in completing production tasks is skilled old technical workers, plus Party members and Communist Youth League members play a backbone role, then our educational forces and focus should be placed on these people." This is correct. In terms of the time, it is best to be about one or two weeks, and at most no more than half a month. The content should be to clarify two or three issues, and it is not advisable to ask for too much, so as not to be difficult to accept. The method must take care of the workers' thoughts, time, and health, and meet their requirements and tastes. Under the condition of workers' voluntary participation, they can collectively board and lodge, so as to concentrate their minds on learning.

    Third, the general political study of Party members should be combined with the education of workers, and a large class should be held once a week to implement the Party's policy education. As for workers' cultural learning, the method should be lively, and it is best to combine it with political learning. The Party committee must regularly check and supervise the trade union's cultural and educational department to carry out this work. It must be recognized that illiteracy not only makes it difficult to learn politics, but also makes it more difficult to learn technology. Therefore, this work must be strengthened to improve the cultural level of worker Party members and lay the foundation for learning science and technology.

    关于支部党员业余训练班的初步总结
    中共大连市委宣传部
        一、工作情况
    重点在工厂、其次是机关、区坊支部。对象是新党员和未受过训的老党员。
    去年七月，中共大连市委宣传部制定了半年业余训练党员计划，确定支部教育重点应在工厂，其次是机关、区坊支部。对象是新党员及未受过训的老党员。内容为党章教材，结合目前党内各种不良倾向。各党委根据自己情况分别举办党员轮流业余训练班，有计划有重点的先把工厂新党员（候补）及未受训的老党员轮训一遍，再轮训所有党员。据三个月统计，五个区另六个单位共举办十三期，受训党员六二八人。
    此外，市宣每月办一期业余短训班。对象为总支、支部宣传委员（第三期规定支书支委参加）；目的专门培养支部教员，提高支部本身业务，借以打下开展支部经常教育工作之基础，普遍进行党员教育。在教育内容上：七、八月份的重点是中国革命性质与共产主义人生观。九、十月份是党章，结合目前党内各种不良倾向。至九月底止，在三个月中市委举办三期，共计学员七二○人。时间为四天至六天。方式用讲授与讨论结合，最后就所提出工作中问题和疑难进行解答，总结好的工作方法，又批判了工作中的不良倾向，以理论指导思想，分析错误根源，使其了解工作错在那里，如何纠正，指出方向。
            二、主要收获
    党员对党章有了初步了解，加强了生产观念，转变了支部的包办作风。
    我们采用以上两种方法进行支部党员教育，主要收获有三点：
    第一，是党员的阶级觉悟和政治认识提高了，树立了革命人生观，澄清了模糊思想和错误认识。本来，大部党员不懂党员的权利与义务。经此次学习，对党章都有了基本了解，并认识到党内不良倾向的严重性，已经阻碍了工作的向前发展。如发展党问题：由于关门主义的存在，好多优秀工人被拒于门外，不发展老技术工人，而只发展会说“漂亮话”的，或“老实头”。如渔网工人董玉兰，每次都被选为“一等功臣”，生产积极，学习又好，政治觉悟也高，但不发展。船渠电工处支书高文海说：“我过去不愿发展党员，怕发展多了掌握不了”。实际上怕顶行，怕发展进来自己“吃不开”了。经学习后，认为“这些思想是违反党章原则的”。有些党员检讨了过去在发展党员时，“拉夫凑数”，“办理手续不慎重”等违反党章规定的错误。认为这是不学习、盲目乱干而产生的结果。
    第二，加强了党员的生产观念，密切了党与群众联系。如船渠党员在学习中检讨说：“过去缺乏生产观点，浪费原料，用的少领的多，使好的不使坏的，使新的不使旧的……”。现在认识到“这是不爱护国家财产的表现”。西岗区渔网工厂生产班长，过去脱离群学，不愿听取群众意见，经学习后，时常拿报纸到班里念给工友听，主动的去联系群众，帮助群众学习。同时，解决了过去老工人党员的单纯技术观点，使他们认识到学习的重要性。如有的老工人在学习之后，马上从家搬到厂子里住，把在训练班学习的问题，自修复习了十二天。麻袋工厂老工友姜守谋入党三年了，觉得自己长进不大，很灰心，不愿学习，经大家帮助分析批判，认识大大提高。
    第三，转变了支部包办代替的官僚主义作风。过去有个别支书把支部弄成单一首长制，自己包办说了就算。有的则存在极端民主化偏向，把民主片面的认为大家说了算，领导上管不了。这两种偏向都已得到批判，认为“与党章规定的民主集中制原则相反的”。这些都说明了党员训练班是提高党员政治认识与生产积极性的有效组织形式和教育方法。因此，大家在学习后都关怀的说：“训练班要经常的办下去，增加我们的工作办法和少犯错误”。
            三、工作检讨
    经验证明，必须团结生产切实进行党章教育。训练班须是短小精干，内容少而精，不能拖拉。
    第一，我们采用了理论与实际结合的基本学习方法，既纠正了工作中的偏差，又提高了党员的思想水平。来市委学习的支委同志说：“训练班短而精干，学回去就能用”。寺儿沟油脂工厂支委杨同志（老工人）学习以后，用生动的实例给党员讲课，很受欢迎。党员都说讲的好，“弄清了过去的模糊思想”。有的经过短训班学习以后，知道支部工作怎样做了。这种联系工作、联系思想的教育方法，大大提高了党员的学习情绪。
    第二，从党员反省中可以看出如下问题：甲、党内普遍存在着对党章不够了解的现象，甚至连党的基本知识都很贫乏，这是由于学习马虎而来的。虽然过去进行过党章的教育，但那是脱离实际工作的说教式的讲解，学与用不相干，致在工作中仍然发生了严重的错误倾向，如在发展党的问题上既有关门主义倾向，也有“拉夫凑数”的倾向。有些同志入党后脱离群众，对群众冷冷淡淡。有的入党后自高自大，不愿劳动，不愿干生产。有的不民主，对工会、建团、行政工作包办代替或包而不办。有的则对党的生产任务认识模糊，缺乏生产观念（如寺儿沟区东久支部以为支部只做发展党的工作）。造成这些偏向的根本原因，主要是缺乏党章的系统教育，或在进行党章教育时与实际分割，以及领导上不深入检查的官僚主义作风。乙、从训练班的效果来看，方法很重要，两种方法，不同效果：一种是业余的集体膳宿，时间短（一期半月左右），内容少，结合支部思想进行教育，党员学习情绪好，从始至终没有缺课，收获大。另一种方法则与此相反，不从实际出发，不照顾与体贴工人的思想情绪与健康，有的办一期费时两个多月，或一个半月，内容多至十几个问题，把工人弄得很疲累，消化不了，反而影响生产。这种方法，反映着缺乏明确的生产观念，不了解业余短训班与脱离生产的党校性质不同，不了解党员的教育工作必须围绕生产任务进行。因为当前党员教育的基本要求是提高其阶级觉悟，发挥生产积极性。因此，训练班必须力求“短小精干”，内容少，有重点，简明扼要，不能拖拉，否则贪多嚼不烂，效果不大。丙、教员讲课是决定关键，必须是负责同志讲，事先有充分准备，与实际结合，讲实际工作、思想中存在的问题。中山区因临时乱拉，教员事前无准备，结果讲的有头无尾，影响学习情绪。因此，如果发现学员不爱听，首先要从讲课人检查起。
    短训班应着重进行阶级教育、政策教育，不应把审查党员历史放在这里作。
    第三，短期训练班的基本任务是提高党员对党的认识，故应着重阶级、政策教育。至于反省，审查党员历史，应当是支部的经常工作，在日常生活、工作中联系群众去进行，如把这些工作放到党训班就不合适。交通公司把反省历史作为一单元来进行，虽然有些收获，但不是教育重点和方向。
            四、几点意见
    第一，继续贯彻市宣半年工作计划，有系统的进行政治教育和阶级教育，以党章为基本教育内容，并结合当前实际政策教育和文化教育为方针。打下明年学习文化、技术之基础。
    第二，思想上必须明确认识，工厂支部的教育是为了发展生产，脱离这个目的就是偏向。对象问题：西岗区在此次学习中明确的提出了：“既然工厂是搞生产，而完成生产任务的主力是熟练的老技术工人，加上党员、团员起骨干推动作用，那么，我们的教育力量和重点，就应当放在这些人身上。”这是对的。在进行时间上，最好一、二个礼拜左右，最多不超过半月时间。内容以弄清二、三个问题为宜，不宜要求过多，免得难以接受。方法一定要照顾工人思想、时间、健康，适合他们的要求和口味，在工人自愿条件下，可以集体膳宿，以便集中心思学习。
    第三，党员一般政治学习与工人教育结合起来，每礼拜上大课一次，贯彻党的政策教育。至于工人文化学习，方式要活泼，最好与政治学习相结合，党委必须定期检查督促工会文教部进行这一工作。一定要认识文盲不但学习政治困难，学习技术更加吃力。因此，必须加强这一工作，以提高工人党员的文化水平，打下学习科学技术的基础。
