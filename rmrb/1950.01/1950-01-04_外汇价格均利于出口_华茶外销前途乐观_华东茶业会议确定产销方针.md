    Exchange Rates Favorable to Exports
    Prospects for Overseas Sales of Chinese Tea Optimistic
    East China Tea Conference Determines Production and Sales Policies
    [This Newspaper Reports] The export of Chinese tea is in a fairly good situation due to the continuous rational adjustment of exchange rates and the repeated increases in tea prices abroad in recent months. According to estimates from Shanghai tea export businesses, the export of Chinese tea from Shanghai since liberation has reached 60,000 cases. Although the number cannot be said to be large, it is a vast improvement over the past few years when the reactionary government's strangling export policies, coupled with unscrupulous merchants exporting inferior tea for profit, resulted in a general decline in international credibility, and the export of Chinese tea was on the verge of collapse. Most of the 60,000 cases of tea were sold to North Africa. However, on the one hand, Chinese tea has been absent for a long time, and on the other hand, there is competition from Ceylon tea, so it has not yet been able to restore brisk sales. Judging from domestic and foreign prices, however, the situation is indeed improving. General merchants engaged in tea export are now actively preparing to resume exports. It is currently estimated that there are still about 10,000 dan (a traditional Chinese unit of weight) of tea in Shanghai that can be exported. As long as there are ships, they can be shipped out continuously.
    As tea is one of China's major export commodities, tea merchants generally believe that future business should move towards collectivization and planning in order to rebuild credibility in the international market and avoid stimulating domestic and foreign market prices. The East China China Tea Company, in conjunction with relevant institutions, convened a conference from the 16th to the 22nd of this month to determine the tasks for the coming year, with clear and specific policies in terms of production and sales, processing, and procurement.

    华茶外销前途乐观
    华东茶业会议确定产销方针
    【本报讯】我国茶业外销，由于近月来外汇不断合理调整与国外茶价的一再上涨，情况已相当良好。据上海茶叶输出业方面估计：沪市自解放后，华茶外销已达六万箱。数目虽不能说很大，但较几年来因反动政府之窒息出口政策，加上一些唯利是图的商人一味以劣质茶叶输出的结果，使国际信誉普遍低落，华茶外销几陷绝境的情形，则已非昔比了。六万箱茶叶大部系销往北菲各地。但一则因华茶绝迹已久，加之锡兰茶的竞争，故目前一时尚未能恢复畅销。若根据国内外价格来看，情况确已日趋好转。一般从事茶叶外销的行商，现正积极准备恢复输出。目前留存国内沪市可供外销之茶叶据估计尚有一万担左右，只要有船出口便可源源外运。
    按茶业系我国大宗出口货之一，为了重建国际市场的信誉，及避免刺激国内外市价，茶商咸认为今后业务应走向集体化和计划化的道路。华东中国茶业公司联合各有关机构曾于本月十六日至二十二日召开大会，确定了明年度的任务，在产销、加工、收购等方面，均有明确具体的方针。
