On the Tasks of Teachers
Kalinin

This article is a speech given by the late Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Kalinin, at a meeting of outstanding urban and rural primary school teachers convened by the editorial department of the Soviet "Teacher's Newspaper" on December 28, 1938. Here, Kalinin vividly and concretely discussed how to be a good teacher. He pointed out that a good teacher should study Marxist-Leninist theory, and that studying Marxist-Leninist theory is not about rote memorization of words and formulas, but about understanding its revolutionary essence; to cultivate builders of the new society, to cultivate the finest human qualities in children, these qualities being love for one's people, honesty, courage, solidarity, and love for labor; to maintain close ties with the surrounding masses of people, and actively participate in social life; to open the mind, use thought, express one's thoughts in one's own language, have one's own speaking style, and not be cliché-ridden. Kalinin's instructions are also worthy of study and remembrance by our comrades who are teachers in our country. Now that the winter vacation has arrived, teachers in various places are taking advantage of the vacation to conduct collective study. We wish to present this document to you. The original is divided into four sections, namely (1) On Mastering Marxist-Leninist Theory; (2) The Teacher's Main Task is to Educate New People – Citizens of Socialist Society; (3) Bringing One's Knowledge to the Masses and Regularly Participating in Social Life is the Teacher's Duty; (4) Teachers Should Put Living Hearts and Thoughts into Their Speaking. Due to space limitations, the first section has been deleted here.

I. On Mastering Marxist-Leninist Theory (Omitted)

II. The Teacher's Main Task is to Educate New People – Citizens of Socialist Society

It's possible that someone spoke here yesterday, but today no one has said anything about how your children are doing, how their work is progressing, and what the relationship with the children is like? Here, a comrade mentioned in passing: "Stipulate duty shifts in the workers' dormitories. Those on duty supervise to prevent the children's behavior from excessively disrupting order." Is that so? ("Yes." A voice answered from somewhere.)

Do you want children to become mediocre people, people with bad stomachs at the age of forty-five? (Laughter) Or do you want children to be just like you – adults? You must know that children have many initiatives. If I were a teacher, if children were mischievous there, and I saw bravery, then I would encourage that bravery, but still slightly criticize them for the mischief, to restrain it. Of course, mischief must be distinguished from mischief.

If someone were to ask me, what is the most important requirement for teachers now? Then I would say: cultivate new people (we often talk about this, I am not saying anything new.) We are creating new people for a socialist society. For this new person, the finest human qualities should be cultivated in him. You must know that although it is a new, socialist person, it is not someone without human feelings. A person is still a person. You must start from this point.

What kind of human qualities should be cultivated? First, it is love, love for one's people, love for the working masses. A person should love people. If he loves people, then he will live well, life will be more pleasant, because in the world no one lives as degenerately as a misanthrope – a hater of humanity. Living worse than anyone else.

Second – honesty. Habits of honesty should be cultivated in children. In my opinion, teachers should thoroughly use all educational methods to achieve this, as much as possible. Not lying, not deceiving, maintaining honesty oneself.

Third – courage. The socialist person – the working person – he wants to conquer the entire world, not only the existing world on earth, but also to expand the entire universe with human wisdom.

Fourth – solidarity among comrades. There should be solidarity among comrades, it is necessary, even if it is because we are surrounded by capitalism, with systematic attacks being carried out on our alliance, and every bourgeois is carrying greed, awaiting an appropriate opportunity to attack the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union can only be defended with a wall of steel. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will become stronger if the solidarity among comrades of the Soviet people is cultivated from a young age – during school age, there is a more real and solid solidarity among comrades. Then, when a person goes to the Red Army, or to the front lines, he will more easily melt into the fighting solidarity, he has already been united by love for the socialist motherland.

Fifth – is to love labor. Not just love, but to treat labor sincerely, here it must be firmly remembered that if a person lives, eats, but does not work, then, that means he is a parasite on other people's labor. This does not need special explanation in front of you. In front of students, however, this must be explained. Regarding labor, a question should be raised in particular. We often say: "Labor is a glorious thing." The leader once put forward the slogan "Labor is a glorious thing." If you just repeat "Labor is a glorious thing," then that is too little. The will of the leader, the will of the party and the people cannot be fulfilled by this. Children should be made to concretely see that labor is truly a glorious thing. Do not deceive children. If there is even a little bit of falsehood, he will not believe it.

The qualities of new people can continue to be listed, however, I will limit myself to this. These are the qualities of Marxist-Leninists. And the requirements for every honest and wise person are the same. What is valuable about our party is that what it demands is the same as what is demanded of honest and wise people.

Discipline – it itself arises from the qualities I mentioned above. Children like to destroy, to chatter. We ourselves were like that. Climbing into someone else's garden – is a pleasure: a stolen apple is sweeter than one's own or one bought. But it should always be said that people must maintain and cherish personality. Not only is there a need to destroy, but there is a need to build – the essence is here. We are not only destroying the old, we are also builders of new things.

I think, to truly become a teacher, a teacher is produced, not just to work. In the work of a teacher, there are many difficulties, and the responsibilities of a teacher are great. Of course, consistent teaching of discipline is a basic task, but in addition to all this, students also imitate teachers. That is why the teacher's worldview, his behavior, his life, his attitude towards every phenomenon, all affect the entire student body in one way or another. This is often a matter of trivial details. But, this is not enough. It can be boldly said: if a teacher is very prestigious, then there will be several people who will leave the mark of this teacher's influence throughout their lives. That is why this is particularly important, that the teacher supervises himself, that he feels that his behavior and his actions are under strong surveillance, in the world there is no one under that kind of surveillance. Dozens of children's eyes are watching him, and nothing is more focused, more acute than children's eyes, more sensitive to the various shades of human psychological life, no one can grasp all those subtleties like children's eyes. This must be remembered.

I am only afraid that I will be implying an idea that you should unnaturally discipline yourselves. This is also not good, this is completely incorrect. The teacher solves all problems naturally, sincerely, especially in solving the various children's affairs, regarding punishment and other such issues. We assume that a boy breaks the glass or insults a girl, or the girl insults the boy. This should not only start from the fact itself, but also take into account how the solution of this or that problem will affect the child's psychology. This is absolutely necessary. Children still have their own "code." We assume that the children are fighting, a child's nose is broken, later, the beaten child goes to tell the teacher. Even a neutral boy will scold him for this: "You shameful thief – you wanted to fight, and then you went to complain!"

The main thing – is to be honest with the children, to supervise oneself, to cultivate truly good, truly socialist citizens from our children – honest, brave, with developed comradeship, trained within the children's psychological and possible scope.

Comrades, finally, let children leave a clear impression, the best impression and memories, of school for many years to come. If you can make your students maintain the memory of their school years throughout their lives, as the memory of the best years – this is a good sign.

That is what I think a teacher should mainly be like.

III. Bringing One's Knowledge to the Masses and Regularly Participating in Social Life is the Teacher's Duty

Now let's talk about the various issues of social life! It is very important to bring teachers closer to the masses, closer to reality, and learn to study local conditions. It would naturally be ideal if all our teachers and our other intellectual cadres fully grasped Marxism-Leninism. Even if they only know the general foundations of this theory, that's not bad. This is not bad for communists or non-party comrades. I dare say that some non-party comrades understand Marxism-Leninism better than party members. Of course, there are not many of them, we now need to learn to treat local life phenomena with the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint and correctly analyze these phenomena. However, on the other hand, in those reports to the people that you have described here, there is absolutely no local life. No matter how many people attended this meeting, no one said that he would present a report on local phenomena. You must know that people are being born, dying, getting married...; there are a lot of social phenomena. Is there nothing to talk about, or is it not possible to talk about it? Are there not many causes?

The construction of collective farms, the development of the economy, are all awakening the thoughts of collective farmers, and linking these thoughts with broad social tasks. There is more than enough interesting reporting material.

Extraordinary activists have emerged in collective farms, reports on such people, including conclusions and pointing out advantages and disadvantages, will undoubtedly arouse heated debates. During healthy discussions on such reports, the social status of collective farmers will be increased, and respect for collective farm labor will also be increased.

The harvest of neighboring collective farms is 10 to 12 to 15 quintals per hectare, while your collective farms are all 5 to 6 quintals. Why is your harvest not good? This is also the subject of your report!

In short, when you enter the lives of farmers, when you want to devote yourself to the work of the people, you must always be able to have a direct and close connection with life, in order to go deep, in order to make the report moving. At this time, undoubtedly, the people will come to listen to your report. In social and political events in our country and the world, there is always more than enough material, that goes without saying.

Finally, the report should be able to be freely discussed, and people should be more tolerant of the way of speaking. The main issue is to make the gist of the report understood, to make people who participate in debating the gist of the issue able to express their opinions without being constrained by the way of speaking, and firmly remember that the way of speaking is a secondary matter. The important issue is to have one's own thoughts.

In the social life of a teacher, it must be made so that wherever he goes, people ask for his opinion, and that what he says is the truth. Farmers should respect teachers, not only because he is a teacher, but also to consider him as an ordinary person, this is a political issue. This is a major political issue. If you want to give teachers the position they deserve, then you must follow the policy of enabling teachers to be selfless and not afraid to express their views on any issue. Teachers can naturally give help in solving farmers' problems, because he is a local citizen, because he participates in all local economic and political life.

Teachers can mainly help farmers in cultural aspects.

The concept of culture is very broad – from washing one's face to the ultimate height of human thought. You can imagine that it is easier to flow into vulgarity here than anywhere else. Clean hands, neat clothes, comfortable homes, and so on, are all symbols of human culture. Public gatherings, drama groups, dance parties, and so on, are symbols of social culture. Communists participate in these activities and justly regard them as factors in cultural development. However, all this can also become vulgar entertainment. In order to see the boundary between vulgarity and genuine cultural development, there must be a large amount of culture and political sense. Marxists believe that these achievements are only means, only a new small stage of advancement. And for the vulgar person, this is the goal. He strives to stabilize his achievements, he becomes a slave to the environment, he fixes habitual morality, and puts his thoughts to sleep. We should fight against this phenomenon.

Therefore, I hope that when you carry out cultural work, you bring social and national components into your work, and bring politics into your work, otherwise, your culture will lose its direction and have the nature of so-called "county culture," losing contact with national culture and contact with national cultural needs.

The cultural work you carry out should be linked to the entire socialist construction, so that people do not use their thoughts in isolation. The vulgar person is someone who uses his thoughts in isolation from the masses, making himself unconnected to anything and anyone.

This work is very difficult. This is very difficult and meticulous work, in terms of having culture oneself, it is exactly the same as the situation in music. A musician can hear a discordant note in an orchestra, while for me, the entire discordant scale would not be noticeable, because I don't understand music. When a discordant note is felt, it should be corrected.

IV. Teachers Should Put Living Hearts and Thoughts into Their Speaking

Comrades, I don't know how your meeting was held yesterday. However, your exchange of opinions is very invisible today, everyone is just making a report on their own work, and some people are even embellishing their work. Did you come here to hold a meeting for everyone to make a more or less unremarkable report? Someone said that this is the case because School A and School B are similar, and people are also similar to each other. However, I think, you are here to hold a meeting in order to "fight."

Why do you use ready-made formulas to speak when you are describing things? You are teachers! You understand Russian! But, do you understand speaking in ready-made sentences? What does that explain? That explains that you are not using your thoughts, only using your tongue. You cannot impress listeners by speaking in ready-made sentences, the reason why you cannot impress listeners is that everyone knows these sentences without you saying them. You are afraid that you cannot speak so beautifully in your own words. You are wrong. Your own words sound better, and have more effect.

In your real lives, there is a broad connection with farmers, with the people. However, when you describe this connection, this connection seems like a kind of "technical" connection: how many meetings were held, how many conversations were conducted, you seem not to be talking about life, but talking about the "technique" of the relationship between farmers and teachers. You must know that you do not only meet people at meetings and in conversations, you should talk about the content of your relationship with the people.

These relationships have political, psychological, and other aspects, these aspects are expressed in people's normal lives. However, in your descriptions, there is no mention of this close organic connection. Maybe I am too old, and therefore didn't hear clearly?! However, I didn't hear a word from you about what your difficulties are, what is pressing you where. You are merely repeating ready-made sentences, which makes the language formulaic. Everyone should speak their own words, the words that their mother taught them. Please believe my conscience: the best words are mother's words. We say: teacher, teacher, the great undertaking is to be a teacher. That's right. But, if the teacher only provides people with ready-made formulas, what will the result be?

You, the last comrade who spoke, work in the countryside. You seem to be satisfied with your situation. You depict the situation as if you are living very well now. However, I think, if people read the stenographic record of your speech, they would hardly believe what you said. This is not because the stenographic record is not correct, it is not like that. It is said that this is primarily because this comrade is a bit boastful. He talked eloquently about what he did, and what he did again. People become wary when they feel that someone is boasting. I tell you frankly, there are many beautiful words in your words, but they are not heartfelt words, your words are not heartfelt words, I don't want to say that you don't have a soul at all. No such thing. I just want to say that you strive to express your truly existing inner state using common formulas. A living person usually pours out his inner feelings in his own simple words, without using ready-made formulas. Therefore, when an educated person reads your stenographic record, he will think of deliberate affectation. There is a situation of deliberate affectation, there is no natural inner state. There are many words, enthusiastic words, these words talk about satisfaction with work, focusing on work. These words are difficult to believe because the words are not thought out by oneself, but are ready-made. Do you understand? Please tell me, did I lie?! Didn't you deliberately affect it? (A seat said: "Yes!")

Please imagine the result of presenting that kind of description, making that kind of report in front of the people! What do you think will be the result? People will listen to your words and leave, and even not ask questions, even if they do ask, they will ask very few.

Therefore, the first thing that is required of a teacher is to have his own speaking style, the one that his mother taught him. Please study grammar so that you can speak correctly, but speak natural, ordinary words.

I should say that teaching is one of the most difficult jobs. I even think that teachers are born. I am talking about teachers in the true sense of the word. Some people have a lot of knowledge. I know a lot of people who are very knowledgeable. However, if you appoint this kind of person as a teacher, he will not explain his subject well. Not only should you understand a subject, but you should also be able to explain it so that the audience can understand it well.

I therefore think that the first thing is to make the language normal. Children should not be accustomed to the old way, accustomed to ready-made formulas – this only needs to "jump over" their ears.

If you speak, then speak your own words! The same substance can be said in different words. Please pay attention, people will listen a little more attentively. The words should be spoken at the right place and at the right time, so that the words take effect. However, here, people's words are spoken very mechanically. The words should not flow out mechanically, but organically, so that the words express one's own thoughts.

When people only use memory without using their brains, they should avoid saying ready-made formulas. Make the words you use to interact with the people simple, your own words, with a natural style. If the style is unnatural, it spoils the fun. Many of you must remember the old women who read dead scriptures in monasteries. Before the revolution, there were many such people in our country. If you were to listen to one of them chanting, then the second person would also chant in the same way: "Lord! Lord..." You should not be like them. Our language is rich, you should not distort it, destroy it, you should also accustom children to this. How to accustom children to this? It is to make them think before they speak, not speak and then think. The foundation is here.
× × ×

These are the tasks that are placed before our teachers. In general, our teachers should be more cultured, not only in the aspect that teachers understand their own subjects, but also in the broad sense of the word, so that spiritual needs are very broad. You yourselves have seen that the people in the cities and the people in the countryside have put forward great cultural demands, and their culture is developing by leaps and bounds.

Our lives are becoming more and more complicated, and it requires workers in all aspects to have an increasingly high "level." If the teacher's current "level" is, for example, two meters high, it should be made even two and a half meters high.

Comrades here talked about the problem of not enough newspapers. Of course, there is a need for newspapers. However, there are not many newspapers for improving your culture. Newspapers are used to determine the political direction at a certain moment, and are used for current needs. In order to improve culture, you need to pay attention to the history of culture, pay attention to the entire cultural heritage of mankind. You should know Russian literature, especially artistic literature. This is indispensable. Teachers have the job of dealing with human materials, dealing with the youngest and most sensitive human materials. Artistic literature is the richest panorama of typical people of all kinds, at least that's what I think. In artistic literature, you can see typical people in infinite kinds of situations. Therefore, knowing artistic literature is almost your responsibility. Therefore, improving culture is first of all knowing artistic literature. It is the most capable of enriching people, enabling people to grow (I judge this based on my own experience), and understanding people better.

That is all I have to say to you. Words can be endless; you have many pressing issues. I think you have already heard the most important and most basic things I wanted to say. I hope that you will not forget my various wishes when you go back. (Stormy applause) (Translated by Jiang Hongju and Shen Jiang)

    论教师的任务
    加里宁
    本文是已故苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席加里宁于一九三八年十二月二十八日在苏联《教师报》编辑部所召集的城市和乡村小学优等教师会议上的演说。加里宁在这里具体生动地讲了如何做一个好教师。他指出，一个好教师应当学马克思列宁主义理论，并且学马列主义理论不是死记字句、公式，而是要领会它的革命实质；要培植新社会的建设者，给儿童培植最优良的人的品质，这些品质就是爱自己的人民，诚实、勇敢、团结、爱劳动；要与周围人民群众密切联系，经常积极参加社会生活；要打开脑筋，运用思想，要用自己的语言表达自己的思想，要有自己的说话风格，不要陈腔滥调。加里宁的这些指示，也值得我国作教员的同志们学习和记取的。现在寒假到了，各地教师都在利用假期进行集体学习，愿将此文献给你们。原文共分四节，即（一）关于掌握马克思列宁主义理论；（二）教师的主要任务是教育新人——社会主义社会的公民；（三）把自己的知识带到人民群众中去，经常参加社会生活是教师的职责；（四）教师应该把活生生的心灵与思想放入自己的说话中。这里因篇幅限制，将第一节删去了。
                                           ——编者
    一、关于掌握马列主义理论（略）
    二、教师的主要任务是教育新人——社会主义社会的公民
    可能是这样，昨天这里有人说话，而今天并没有任何人说你们这里孩子怎么样，对他们的工作怎样在进行，与孩子们的关系是怎么样？这里有一位同志顺便说：“在工人宿舍里规定值班。值班的监视着，为了要使孩子们的行为不要过分破坏秩序。”是这样的吗？（“是的”。从某处发出一个回答的声音）
    难道你们愿意要小孩子成为一个庸庸碌碌的人，成为四十五岁有着不大好的胃的人吗？（笑）或是愿意小孩子是恰像你们一样——成年的人呢？要知道孩子们是有很多创举的。假如我是一个教师，假使孩子们在那里顽皮了，而这里看出了勇敢，那么我就鼓励这种勇敢，但对顽皮这一点也还是少许责难他们一下，以此来限制。当然，顽皮与顽皮是要得分辨的。
    假使有人问我，现在什么是对教师最主要的要求呢？那么我说：培养新人（我们常常说到这个，我没有说什么新东西。）我们正在造就社会主义社会的新人。对于这个新人物，应当培植他以最优秀的人类品质。要知道虽是新的，社会主义的人物，但并不是没有人类感情的人。人终归是人。要从这一点出发。
    应当培养怎样的人类品质呢？第一，就是爱，对自己的人民的热爱，对劳动群众的热爱。一个人应当热爱人们。假如他将热爱人们，那么他将生活得要好，生活将更愉快，因为在世界上没有任何人像厌世者——人类憎恨者，生活得那样堕落不堪。比任何人生活得都坏。
    第二——诚实。要养成孩子们诚实的习惯。照我的意见，教师应当彻底地用一切教育的方法达到这一点，只要是可能的。不说谎，不骗人，自己保持诚实。
    第三——勇敢。社会主义的人物——劳动的人——他要征服全世界，不仅是现存的地球上的世界，而且要以人的智慧扩展整个宇宙。
    第四——同志间的团结。应当使有同志间的团结，它是必要的，即或是因为我们正处在资本主义的包围中，对我们联盟有系统的攻击正在进行着，而每一个布尔乔亚都带着贪欲，期待着适当的时机，攻击苏联。苏联只有用钢铁一般的墙壁，才可以保卫得住。苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟将会更强大，假使苏维埃人民的同志间的团结，在小小年纪就培养起来——在学龄之时更有真正的、牢固的同志间的团结。那时，一个人到红军中，或是到前线，他就会更容易溶化入战斗的团结中，他已被对社会主义祖国的爱所结合了。
    第五——就是要爱好劳动。不仅只是爱好，而是诚恳地对待劳动，这里要牢牢记住，假使一个人活着，吃饭，而不工作，那么，这就是说他寄食于别人的劳动。这个在你们面前不特别需要解释。在学生们面前，却要解释这一点。关于劳动，特别应当提起一个问题。我们常常说：“劳动是一件光荣的事情”。领袖曾经提出这个口号“劳动是一件光荣的事”，假使你们只是重复地说“劳动是一件光荣的事”，那么，就太少了。并不能以此完成领袖的意志，党和人民的意志。应当使孩子们具体地看到劳动真正是一件光荣的事。不要欺骗孩子。假使有很少一点虚假，他就会不相信的。
    新人的品质可以继续列举下去，不过，我只限于此。这就是马列主义者的品质。而对于每一个诚实的、明智的人的要求也就是这样。我们党的可贵就在于此，它所要求者，就如要求于诚实的、明智的人一样。
    纪律——它本身就产生于上面，我所说过的那些品质。孩子们喜欢破坏，东拉西扯。我们自己也曾是这样的。爬到别人的园子里——是一种快乐：偷来的苹果，比自己的或是买来的要甜些。但是总是应当说，人们要保持和爱护人格。不仅是需要破坏，而且需要建设——实质就在这里。我们不仅只是破坏旧的，我们还是新东西的建设者。
    我想，要是真正成为一个教师，一个教师产生出来，不仅只是要工作。在教师的工作中，是有很多困难的，而教师的职责又是伟大的。当然，一致的纪律的讲授，这是一个基本的工作，但除了这一切外，学生们还模仿着教师。这就是为什么教师的世界观、他的举止、他的生活、他对于每一个现象的态度，都或者这样，或者那样影响着全体学生们。这常常是细微末节的。但是，这是不够的。可以大胆地说：假使一个教师是很有威望的，那么，会有若干人在整个生命里留下这个教师的影响的印迹。这就是为什么这一点特别重要，即要教师监督自己，要他感觉到他的举止和他的行动是在强有力的监视下，在世界上没有任何一个是在那一种监视下。数十双儿童们的眼睛看着他，而且没有任何东西比儿童眼睛更专注，更敏锐，对人的心理生活之各种不同的色调感受性更强，没有任何人能像儿童眼睛捉摸到那些所有的细微处。这须要记住。
    我只怕，我这会是暗示一种意思叫你们应当不自然地律己。这也是不好的，这完全是不正确的。教师解决一切问题，自然、诚恳，特别是在解决各种不同的孩子们的事情上，关于惩罚及其他等等问题上。我们假定，一个男孩子打破了玻璃或是侮辱了一个女孩子，或者是女孩侮辱男孩吧。这就应当不仅只是从如何如何个事实本身出发，而且要顾虑到这个问题之或此或彼的解决将怎样作用于儿童的心理。这是绝对必要的。小孩子们仍是有自己的“法典”的。我们假设，孩子们打起架来了，一个孩子鼻子打破了，后来，这个遭打的去告了教师。甚至于一个中立的男孩子会为此责骂他说：“你这个丢人贼——你想打架，而以后又去告状！”
    主要的——就是对孩子们要诚实，监督自己，从我们的孩子中间培养出真正好的、真正社会主义的公民——诚实的，勇敢的、具有发展了的同志情感的、在儿童心理的和儿童可能的范围内训练出来的。
    同志们，最后，要使儿童们在很长的年代中对学校留下显明的印象，最优良的印象和回忆。假使你们能做到，使你们的学生们在整个生命中保持对于学校年代的记忆，作为是最美好的年代的回忆——这便是一个好的标志了。
    这就是我所认为教师主要应当怎样。
    三、把自己的知识带到人民群众中去，经常参加社会生活是教师的职责
    现在来谈谈社会生活的种种问题吧！使教师接近群众，接近现实，学会研究地方情况，这是很重要的。如果我们的所有一切教师和我们的其他知识分子干部都完全掌握了马列主义，这自然是很理想的。即使他们只知道这一理论的一般基础，这也不坏。对于共产党员来说也好，对于非党同志来说也好，这已经不坏了，我敢担保，有些非党同志比党员更懂得马列主义。当然，他们人数是不多的，我们现在需要学会用马列主义的观点来对待地方生活现象和正确地分析这些现象。然而另一方面，在你们在这里所叙述到的对人民所作的那些报告里，是完全没有地方生活的。无论有多少人出席了这个会，没有一个人说他要提出关于地方现象的报告。要知道，人们正在出生、死亡、结婚……；社会现象一大堆。难道没有什么可以讲，还是不可以讲？难道起因不多吗？
    集体农场的建设，经济的发展，在在都唤醒着集体农民的思想，使这思想与广泛的社会任务联系在一起。充满兴味的报告材料绰绰有余。
    集体农场里涌现出来了非凡的活动家，关于这种人的报告，附及结论和关于优缺点的指出，无疑是会引起热烈辩论的。在进行关于这种报告的健全讨论的时候，集体农民的社会地位便增高了，对集体农场劳动的尊重也提高了。
    相邻集体农场的收成是一公顷十至十二至十五公担，而你们集体农场都是五至六公担。为什么你们的收成不好？这便也是你们作报告的题材呀！
    总而言之，当你们走入农民生活中的时候，当你们想致力于人民工作的时候，总还要作得能够和生活有直接的紧密的联系，以求深入，以求报告动人。这时候，无疑地，人民会来听你们的报告的。在我国和全世界的社会事件和政治事件中，材料随时总是绰绰有余的，这是不言而喻的。
    最后，还要使报告能够被自由地讨论，使人们对待发言方式能较忍耐。主要的问题是要使报告的主旨被人了解，要使参加辩论主旨问题的人能不拘束叙说的方式而说出自己的意见，牢牢地记住说的方式是次要的事情。重要的问题是要有自己的思想。
    在教师的社会生活中，必需要使他走到那里，那里便询问他的意见，要使他所说的话是老实话。要使农民尊敬教师，不仅是因为他是教师，而且也要把他作为一个平常的人，要考虑到这是政治问题。这是重大的政治问题。如果想使教师有应得的地位，那末，便要奉行使教师能大公无私，不怕对任何问题说出自己观点方针。在解决农民问题的时候，教师自然是可以给予帮助的，因为他是当地的公民，因为他参加当地一切经济生活和政治生活。
    教师主要地可以在文化方面帮助农民。
    文化的观念是非常广泛的——从洗脸到人类思想最后的高度。你们可以想像得到，在这里比在任何地方都容易流入庸俗些。手膀清洁，衣着整齐，住宅舒适等等之类，在在都是人类有文化的象征。公众集会，戏剧小组，跳舞晚会等等，便是社会文化的象征。共产党人参加这些活动，而将它们公正地看作文化发展的因素。但是，这一切也可能变为庸俗的消遣，为了看得出庸俗与真正文化发展之间的界限，便要有多量的文化性以及政治嗅觉。马克思主义者认为这些成就只是手段，只是前进的一个新的小阶段。而对于庸人来说，这就是目的了。他力求使其成就稳定下来，他成了环境的奴隶，他使习常的道德固定起来，使思想入睡。我们应该对这种现象作斗争。
    因此，愿你们在进行文化工作的时候，把社会、国家成份带进工作里去，把政治带进工作里去，否则，你们的文化便丧失了方向而有所谓“一县文化”的性质，丧失了与全国文化的联系和与全国文化需要的联系。
    你们所进行的文化工作，应该与整个社会主义建设联系起来，以使人不孤立地运用思想。庸人，便是脱离群众孤立地运用思想、使自己不和任何事物及任何人联系的人。
    这一工作是非常困难的。这是非常困难而细致的工作，就自己要有文化这一点来说的话，这和音乐方面的情况完全一样。音乐家对于管弦乐队里的一个变调音符都听得清，而对于我，整个变调音阶也会是注意不到的，因为我不懂音乐。当感觉到变调音符的时候，便应该矫正它。
    四、教师应该把活生生的心灵与思想放入自己的说话中
    同志们，我不知道你们昨天的会是怎样开的。但是，你们的交换意见今天是很看不出的，人人都不过是作一下关于自己工作的汇报而已，有些人还粉饰工作。难道你们在这里开会是为了每一个人作一个或多或少平淡无奇的汇报吗？有人说所以如此，正因为甲校和乙校是相像的，人们也是相互相像的。但是，我想，你们之所以在这里开会，是为了“打架”。
    为什么你们在叙述的时候，便要用现成的公式来说话呢？你们是教师呀！你们是懂俄文的！但是，你们懂不懂用现成的句子说话？说明了什么？这说明了你们没有运用思想，只是运用舌头而已。你们用现成的句子说话是不能使听者有印象的，不能使听者有印象的原因，便是这种句子不要你说大家便都知道。你们害怕用自己的话不能说得那么漂亮。你们错了。自己的话还好听些，效果还多些。
    在你们的现实生活中，存在着与农民、与人民的广大联系。但是，当你们叙述这一联系的时候，这一联系看来像一种“技术上的”联系似的：召开了多少集会呀，进行了多少交谈呀，你们仿佛不是在谈生活，而是在谈农民与教师相互关系的“技术”。要知道，你们不只是在集会上和交谈时才与人们见面的，应该谈你们和人民的关系的内容。
    这些关系有政治的、心理的等等方面，这些方面表现在人们的正常生活中。但是，在你们的叙述中，没有谈到这一紧密的有机联系。也许我已经太老了，因而没有听清楚？！但是，我没有听见你们一句话谈到你们的困难何在、有什么在何处紧迫着你们。你们仅仅是在重复现成的句子，这便使语言公式化了。每一个人都应该说自己的话，说他妈妈教给他的话。请相信我的良心：最好的话是妈妈的话。我们说：教师，教师，伟大的事业是做教师。这是对的。但是，如果教师仅仅只向人们提供现成的公式，结果究竟会怎样呢？
    你这最后一个讲话的同志，是在乡村里工作。你仿佛对你的情况是满意的。你把情况描画得就像你现在生活得非常好似的。但是，我想，如果人们读了你讲话的速记稿，便会很少相信你所说的话了。这并不是因为速记得不正确，并不是这样的。据说，这首先是因为这个同志有一点自夸了。他滔滔地说道：我做了什么什么，又做了什么什么。人们一感到有人在自吹自擂了，便提防起来了。我率直地告诉你，你的话中有许多漂亮的话，但是，并不是由衷的话，你的话并不是由衷的话，我丝毫也不想说你没有心灵。没有这种事情。我只是想说，你力求用通用的公式来表现你真正有的内心状态。一个活生生的人通常是用自己的简单的话来倾诉内心感觉的，是不采用现成的公式的。因此，当一个有文化的人读你的速记稿的时候，他会想到故意做作。故意做作的情况是有的，自然的内心状态是没有的。有许多话，热情的话，这些话谈到对工作满意，专心工作。这些话之所以令人难以相信，是因为话不是自己想出来的，而是现成的。你懂不懂？请你说，我说了谎没有？！你难道没有故意做作吗？（一个位子上说：“对！”）
    请设想一下在人民面前提出那种叙述，做那种报告的结果吧！你们想，会有什么结果？对于你们的话，人们听听便走开了，甚至问题也没有提，即使是提，也会提得很少。
    因此，要求于教师的第一件事，便是要有自己的、母亲所教给自己的说话风格。请你研究文法，以便把话说得正确，但是，要说自然的普通的话。
    我应该说，教师工作是最困难的工作之一。我甚至想到，教师是生就了的。我说到教师，是就这个字的真义说的。有些人们知识很多。我认识很多学问很漂亮的人。但是，如果任命这种人当教师，他却不会好好地讲述他的那门学问了。不仅是应该懂一门学问，而且还应该会把它讲述得使听众能够很好地听懂。
    我因而想到，首先第一是要使言语正常。不应该使小孩子习惯于老一套，习惯于现成的公式——这只要在他们耳边“跳过去”便行了。
    你如果说话，便说自己的话吧！同一的实质，可以用不同的话来说。请你注意，人们会稍注意地倾听了。应该使话说得适地适时，使话生效。但是，在这里，人们的话说得很机械。应该使话不是机械地、而是有机地流露出来，使话表现自己的思想。
    当人们只用记忆而不费脑子的时候，应该避免说现成的公式。要使你们借以与人民来往的话，是简单的、自己的话，有自然的风格。风格如果不自然，便败兴了。你们之中一定有许多人记得上修道院读死经的老年妇女们。在革命前，我国有许多这种人。如果你要是听她们之中一个人念经，那末，第二个人也同样地喋喋念道：“主啊！主啊……”不应该和她们一样。我们的语言是丰富的，你们不要曲解它，毁坏它，要使小孩子也习惯于此。怎样使小孩子习惯于此呢？便是要使他们先想后说，不是说了而后再想。基础便在这里。	    ×        ×          ×
    这些便是摆在我们的教师面前的任务。总起来说，我们的教师还应该更有文化些，不仅仅在教师懂得自己的学科这一方面有文化，而且是在这个词儿的广义解释上有文化，使精神需要很广泛。你们自己看到了城市人民和农村人民都提出了很大的文化需求，他们的文化大踏步地在发展着。
    我们的生活愈来愈复杂了，它要求各方面的工作者都有愈来愈高的“水平”。如果教师现在的“水平”譬如是两米高，应该使它即使是两米半高也好。
    同志们在这里谈到了报纸不够的问题。当然，对于报纸的需要是存在的。然而，为了增进你们的文化的报纸是不多的。报纸是用以在一定的时刻决定政治方向的，是用于当前需要的。为了提高文化，需要去注意文化史，注意人类的全部文化遗产。应该知道俄国文学尤其是艺术文学。没有这是不行的。教师有处理人这种材料的工作，处理最年青的和最易感的人这种材料的工作。艺术文学是各种人的典型的最丰富的全景，至少我是这样想的。在艺术文学中，你们可以看见无穷种类情况下的人的典型。因此，认识艺术文学，这几乎是你们的职责。因此，提高文化，这首先是认识艺术文学。它最能使人丰富起来，使人有可能成长（我凭自己的经验这样判断），更了解人。
    这便是我所有一切要向你们说的话。话可以是无穷的；你们的痛切问题很多。我想说的最主要的、最基本的东西，你们已经听了。我希望你们回去后不要忘掉了我的种种愿望。（暴风雨般的鼓掌）（蒋洪举  沈江合译）
