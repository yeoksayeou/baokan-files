    In Response to the Call of "Production for Disaster Relief and Frugality to Overcome Hardship"
    Tianjin Railway Bureau Establishes a Thrift Inspection Committee
    [This newspaper dispatch] In response to the government's call for production for disaster relief and frugality to overcome hardship, and to implement the spirit of production and frugality of the Bureau in July, August and September, the Tianjin Railway Bureau has established a thrift inspection committee to strictly inspect the work of various production and administrative departments over the past year, and to formulate various work systems and disciplines to meet the great construction tasks of 1950. During July and August, all employees of the Bureau launched a production and frugality meritorious service campaign. After three months of effort, they achieved good results in improving production, reducing costs, saving expenses, and improving leadership methods; and this campaign has been turned into a long-term mass action policy. On December 10th, the Tianjin Municipal Government issued a call to "launch a production and frugality campaign in all municipal agencies and public enterprises". Following Premier Zhou's call on December 19th from the State Council to "nationwide production for disaster relief and frugality to overcome hardship," the leadership of the Bureau, after careful discussion, formally decided at the Bureau Affairs Meeting on December 24th to organize thrift inspection committees within and outside the Bureau in various regions and units. Within the Bureau, the director of the office, Lin Zi'an, will serve as the chief director, and Zheng Sisu of the Finance Department, Huo Zirui of the General Affairs Department, and Li Zhengang of the Trade Union will serve as deputy directors. One person from each of the Transportation, Mechanical, Engineering, Electrical, Personnel, Materials, Public Security, Political Department, and Youth League departments will serve as a committee member. The committee will set up various specialized groups to specifically inspect various expenses, and ordered Zhangjiakou, Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Dexian regions to establish committees separately to formulate inspection scopes, steps, and methods. The first phase will be from December 25th to January 25th, 1950, and it is necessary to identify all instances of corruption and waste and serious dereliction of duty, and to identify all typical model figures and deeds on the production and frugality front, to strictly enforce rewards and punishments, and to establish a righteous atmosphere. Based on the inspection results and the rationalization proposals of the broad masses of employees, various necessary measures and systems will be stipulated and adhered to for a long time to run the people's railways well. The Tianjin Railway Trade Union and the Tianjin Railway Work Committee of the Youth League have issued instructions, calling on members of the League and all employees to mobilize and get involved in this movement to successfully complete the task and lay a solid foundation for the work of 1950. Various specialized inspection groups have been established in various departments of the Bureau and have begun inspection work.
