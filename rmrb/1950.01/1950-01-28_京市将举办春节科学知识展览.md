Beijing News: In order to popularize and improve the people's scientific knowledge and carry out Spring Festival literary and artistic propaganda activities, the Science Popularization Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the Bureau of Culture and Education of the Beijing Municipal Government have decided to hold the "Spring Festival Science Knowledge Exhibition" from February 17th to 26th (i.e., the first to tenth days of the first lunar month) at the Middle School Affiliated to the Teachers' University outside Hepingmen. The exhibition will include general science knowledge, knowledge from apes to humans, and maternal and child health knowledge. Amusement activities will also be organized outside the venue. In order to mobilize the masses to visit in large numbers to achieve greater results, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education sent a letter to the cultural and artistic departments of each district a few days ago, mobilizing and organizing students from adult night schools, children's literacy classes, and women's literacy classes to visit collectively. At the same time, students should be encouraged to mobilize their parents and relatives to visit. In order to prevent overcrowding, a schedule for visits by each district has been established: February 17th for Districts 1 and 11, 18th for Districts 2 and 12, 19th for Districts 3 and 13, 20th for Districts 4 and 14, 21st for Districts 5 and 15, 22nd for Districts 6 and 16, 23rd for Districts 7 and 17, 24th for Districts 8 and 18, 25th for Districts 9 and 19, and 26th for Districts 10 and 20.
