They also sent letters to congratulate all officers and soldiers on the New Year, and put forward five major tasks for 1950: (1) Thoroughly eliminate the remaining enemies and the lurking and scattered bandits and secret agents, and consolidate the southwest national defense construction; (2) Transfer a large number of cadres to participate in local work; (3) Conduct troop training and move towards a regularized national defense army; (4) Strictly abide by discipline and implement policies; (5) Pay attention to thrift and reduce the burden on the people.

Zhang Aiping, commander of the East China Navy, guaranteed at the New Year's get-together that the navy must closely cooperate with fraternal troops to complete the task. All the officers and soldiers of a certain warship wrote to their superiors, guaranteeing to strengthen their studies and resolutely carry out orders. The Special Column organized a New Year's慰问团 to慰问 a certain artillery unit on the Zhejiang East front. All units held army-civilian get-togethers, reminiscence parties, sports and military technical competitions, and慰问 wounded and sick comrades in their stationed areas.

    The officers and soldiers of the Central and South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army are determined to liberate Hainan Island and completely eliminate the remaining enemies in the entire Central and South region in 1950 while enthusiastically celebrating the New Year.
