    Chahar Province Special District Cooperative Directors' Conference Makes Decision to Fully Supply Spring Farming Tools
    [Chahar News] In order to prepare agricultural tools and ensure the smooth development of agricultural production, the Chahar Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative held a conference of directors of special district cooperatives on the 7th of this month to study issues such as the manufacturing and supply of agricultural tools. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the past and do a good job in preparing agricultural tools, the conference decided that cooperatives at all levels should regard the operation of agricultural tools as their main business at present, and set the policy that all businesses must not affect the operation of agricultural tools. It was also decided that, according to the needs of the masses and their own capabilities, they should first operate enough of the main agricultural tools needed for spring farming; in terms of time, the masses must be able to buy them a month before use. The conference also formulated specific operating plans for the first batch of agricultural tools for the province and special district cooperatives, based on the time required for the entire process of production, transportation, and distribution, and based on the handicraft production situation in Chahar South and Yanbei and the needs of the masses in Chahar North.

    察省专区社主任会议作出决定
    充分供给春耕农具
    【察哈尔讯】察哈尔省供销总社，为了准备农具，保证农业生产顺利开展，于本月七日召开了各专区社的主任会议，研究了农具制造供给等问题。为了克服过去存在的缺点，做好农具准备工作，会议决定各级社今后要把农具经营当做目前主要业务，定出一切业务不能影响农具经营的方针。并决定根据群众需要和本身力量，首先将春耕需要的主要农具作足够的经营；在时间上，必须在使用前一个月让群众买到手里。会议并根据生产、运输、分配整个过程所需时间，根据察南、雁北手工业生产的情况及察北群众需要，作出了省、专社第一批农具具体的经营计划。
