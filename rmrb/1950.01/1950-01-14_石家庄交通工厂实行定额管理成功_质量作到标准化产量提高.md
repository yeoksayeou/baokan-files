Shijiazhuang Transportation Factory Successfully Implements Quota Management
Quality Standardized, Output Increased

[This Newspaper's Report] In the third production emulation campaign, the Shijiazhuang Transportation Factory implemented two types of quota management: quality and work hours. The quality of products reached standardization, and production efficiency rapidly increased. They are now making further efforts to prepare for setting quotas for raw material usage. The quota management work of the factory is introduced as follows:

        It is Necessary to Strengthen Statistical Work to Lay the Foundation for Quota Management

(A) Several basic problems that must be solved first:

One, strengthen and improve statistical work: As early as August of last year, the factory felt that to achieve scientific and rational management, it was necessary to strengthen statistical work as a reliable basis for analyzing and improving work.

There are three main types of forms used in production, namely the manufacturing order, the task breakdown record, and the team assignment order. Each form is divided into upper and lower sections. The upper section summarizes the assigned tasks from top to bottom, and the lower section records the actual production completion from bottom to top. This clearly compares the assigned tasks with the completion situation.

However, for statistical work to be timely and accurate, it must have a solid mass base. In the past, the factory's statistics were controlled by the engineering section and the production team leaders, without mobilizing everyone to participate. As a result, statistics were not timely or accurate. To completely solve this problem, in August of last year, the factory began to discuss and deliberate among the employees, letting the workers fill out the assignment orders themselves. They successively corrected some cadres' erroneous ideas, such as thinking that the workers couldn't do a good job and fearing that the workers would be irresponsible (inaccurate). They educated and enlightened the workers on the understanding and interest in statistics. This laid a reliable foundation for the determination of rational quotas.

        Implementing Quota Management Should Fix Personnel and Machines

Two, fix the labor force, equipment, products, and work methods:

To implement quota management, it is necessary to fix the labor force, equipment allocation, products, and work methods. In the past, due to the lack of fixed personnel, equipment, and products, there were frequent temporary transfers. Everyone was not familiar with the equipment, and techniques were not easily mastered. In particular, the products produced by each machine were frequently changed, wasting a lot of work hours and adding a lot of trouble to the statistical work and quota management.

However, when the issue of fixing the labor force, equipment, and products was raised, many workers and apprentices felt that they could not learn more techniques. They were willing to go to the repair department but unwilling to work in the main product (technically simpler) department, and they requested to change jobs frequently in the future. In addition to actively and patiently explaining to the workers the significance of fixing for improving quality and reducing costs, the leadership also let everyone discuss some examples of finished products that were more expensive than those in Tianjin. The workers' thinking slowly became clear.

To meet the workers' requests and make everyone feel at ease in production, the leadership agreed in principle to change jobs once every three months, but it would be determined based on the individual's technical proficiency, daily actual production performance, and the overall factory's operating conditions and production plan. In addition, the workers were informed that the main standards for wage assessment next year would be the quality and quantity of daily production and the situation of defective work. At the same time, a technical research association was organized to ensure that everyone not only learned techniques from practical work but also improved their technical knowledge theoretically.

After clearing the workers' minds, the leadership formulated preliminary opinions based on specific technical conditions, discussed them in groups, and finally determined the personnel allocated to each machine and the fixed machine production.

Three, strengthen planning:

Based on the results of discussions and research with various units, a general production plan for the entire factory was formulated. Once the plan is determined, it should not be affected by outside repair work or sporadic needs. For example, if a part is needed for repairing a car and the factory does not have it, they would rather send someone to buy it elsewhere than let it affect or change the general production plan and disrupt the production process. This greatly ensured the improvement of efficiency and the reduction of costs.

        Strengthen Ideological Leadership, Break Down Workers' Concerns

Four, deeply explain the meaning of quotas, and promptly dispel ideological concerns:

When the quality quota was proposed, some workers did not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of quality standardization, and some had the idea that a little difference didn't matter much. To effectively and thoroughly solve this problem, in addition to persuasion and education, the leadership let everyone go to the repair section to see the specific situation of the car repair parts for practical education. Because everyone understood that parts (products) could not be used if they were even a little off, they ideologically understood and valued ensuring that the quality reached the standard.

When the work hour quota was proposed, some workers were unwilling to set it, worrying that the quota would change frequently and gradually increase, making everyone struggle to catch up behind the quota, or even fail to catch up. The leadership promptly understood the root of this idea and patiently explained to everyone that the meaning of the quota was to accurately make production plans and calculate costs, so that each process could cooperate well with each other, implement scientific management, and improve production.

(B) Quotas become the conscious goal of every worker:

The factory's quality quota was formulated based on the current improvement in the technical proficiency of the workers and a suitable increase in the quality standards before the competition. The work hour quota for each production process was formulated based on the average figures of work hours and production volume statistically gathered in October before the competition, and with reference to the advanced production records after the start of the competition. After the engineering section formulated the quota, it was submitted to each team for evaluation, and revisions were made based on the workers' opinions. In this way, once the quota was determined, completing and exceeding the quota became the conscious action of every worker.

(C) The work hour quota is closely linked to the quality quota and conscientious product inspection work, ensuring that production efficiency is improved under the conditions of meeting and improving product quality, so as to avoid the bias of emphasizing quantity over quality, causing losses to production. At the beginning of this work, the leadership attached importance to product inspection work, and therefore, the number and quality of products rose in parallel.

        After Implementing Quota Production:
            One, There is a Basis for Ordering Plans.
            Two, Improved Workers' Sense of Responsibility and Enthusiasm.
            Three, There are Standards for Evaluation.

(D) Gains:

One, the implementation of quota management paved the way for scientific management. Ordering plans is no longer based on estimation, but on specific quotas as a basis. At the same time, it is easier to grasp the progress of production, understand and analyze the existing problems in a timely manner, and solve them in time. Especially for the allocation of equipment and personnel in each planning department and the mutual cooperation of each production process, there is a more correct basis, and the phenomenon of mutual disconnection will no longer occur.

Two, the universal strengthening of quota management improved the workers' sense of responsibility and enthusiasm, and also played a strong driving role for the relatively backward. Everyone is unwilling to lag behind. Workers are no longer indifferent to their own production number and quality, but often consider, if they cannot complete the quota, they will find the reason and try to complete and break through the quota. Now, no matter who you ask, they know how much work they have done and how the quality is.

Three, there is a reliable basis for evaluation: In the past, evaluation often took a lot of time and was not easy to be correct because there was no clear and specific achievement as a basis. Now, the production performance record is the most specific and accurate proof of merit, and the evaluation is correct and time-saving.

    石家庄交通工厂实行定额管理成功
    质量作到标准化产量提高
    【本报讯】石家庄交通工厂在第三次生产竞赛运动中，实行了质量与工时两种定额管理，产品质量达到标准化，生产效率迅速提高。现正作进一步努力，准备规定原材料使用定额。兹将该厂的定额管理工作介绍如下：
            必须加强统计工作打下定额管理基础
    （甲）首先要解决的几个基本问题：
    一、加强健全统计工作：远在去年八月该厂就感到要想经营管理达到科学合理，必须加强统计工作，作为分析、改进工作的可靠依据。
    生产中主要表格有三种，即制造厂单、分工纪录单、股派工单。每表分上、下两栏，上栏自上而下分配任务纪要，下栏则是自下而上实际生产完成情况报告纪实，这样就极显明的对照了所分配的任务与完成情况。
    但统计工作要及时、精确，必须有稳固的群众基础。该厂过去统计是由工务科与各生产股长掌握，没有发动大家共同作，结果使统计不易及时、精确。为彻底解决这一问题，去年八月即开始在职工中酝酿、讨论，让工人自己填派工单，曾先后纠正了某些干部认为工人搞不好，怕工人不负责任（不精确）等错误思想，教育、启发了工友们对统计的认识与兴趣。这给合理定额的确定，奠定了可靠的基础。
            实行定额管理应固定人员机器
    二、固定劳动力、机具、生产品和工作方法：
    要实行定额管理，必须固定劳动力、机具配备、生产品和工作方法。过去由于人员、机具、产品均不固定，经常临时调动，大家对机具很不熟悉，技术不易熟练，尤其是各机具所生产的产品因经常更改，浪费不少工时，给统计工作与定额管理增加好多麻烦。
    但当固定劳动力、机具、生产品问题提出后，许多工友和学徒认为不能多学技术，愿意去修配部门，不愿在主要产品（技术较简单）部门工作，要求以后经常调换工作。领导上除积极耐心的向工友们解释，说明固定对提高质量、减低成本的意义外，并将某些成品较天津贵的实例让大家讨论，工友们思想就慢慢的明白了。
    为满足工友要求，使大家安心生产，领导上原则同意三个月调换工作一次，但要根据个人技术熟练程度，日常实际生产成绩和整个工厂经营的好坏与生产计划来决定。另外又向工友说明明年再评定工资时主要以日常生产中质数量、废活的情况作标准。同时，组织技术研究会，保证大家不仅从实际工作中学技术，而且从理论上提高技术知识。
    打通工友思想后，然后就根据具体技术条件，由领导上拟定初步意见，分组讨论，最后确定各机器所配备的人员与固定机器生产品。
    三、加强计划性：
    根据与各单位讨论研究结果，制定全厂总的生产计划。计划既经确定，即需不受外活修配与零星需要的影响。例如因修车需要零件而本厂没有，宁可派人到外处去买，亦不使它影响更动总的生产计划，打乱生产过程。这样大大的保证了效率的提高与成本的降低。
            加强思想领导  打破工友顾虑
    四、深入的说明定额的意义，及时解除思想顾虑：
    当提出质量定额时，有些工友曾对质量标准化的重要意义认识不足，有的存在着差一点半点没多大关系的想法。为有效彻底解决这个问题，领导上除说服教育外，就让大家到修理股去看修车配件的具体情况，作实际教育，由于大家了解到零件（产品）差一点一滴就不能使用，因而思想上领会与重视保证质量一定达到标准。
    当提出工时定额时，曾有些工友不愿定，顾虑定额经常变动，逐步提高，使大家在定额后面费力追赶，甚或赶不上。领导上及时了解这个思想根源，耐心向大家说明定额的意义是为了精确的作生产计划与计算成本，使各过程相互很好的配合，实行科学管理，搞好生产。
    （乙）定额成为每个工友自觉的奋斗目标：
    该厂质量定额是根据目前工友技术熟练程度已经提高，将竞赛前的质量标准加以适当提高拟订的。各生产程序的工时定额是根据竞赛前十月份统计的工时与生产量的平均数字并参照竞赛开始后先进的生产纪录拟定的。工务科拟定后，分别交各股评议，经过工友的意见作了修正。这样，定额一经确定，完成和超过定额就成为每个工友的自觉行动。
    （丙）工时定额紧密结合着质量定额及认真的产品检验工作，保证在适合与提高产品质量的情况下提高生产效率，不致因发生重量不重质的偏向，使生产遭受损失。该厂在这一工作进行之初，领导上就重视产品检验工作，因而，产品数、质量是并列上升的。
            实行定额生产后：
            一、订计划有依据。
            二、提高了工友的责任心、积极性。
            三、评奖有标准。
    （丁）收获：
    一、定额管理的实行，给科学管理铺平了道路。订计划再不是凭估计，而是有具体定额作依据。同时，便于掌握生产进展情况，及时的了解分析存在的问题而加以及时解决，尤其对计划各部门机具、人员的配备以及各生产程序相互配合上，有了比较正确的根据，不致再发生相互脱节现象。
    二、定额管理普遍的加强提高了工友们的责任心、积极性，对比较落后的也起了有力的带动作用。大家都不甘落后，工友们再不是对自己生产数、质量不大关心，而是经常考虑，如完成不了定额就追寻原因，设法完成与突破定额，现在不管问谁，都知道自己干了多少活，质量怎么样了。
    三、评奖有了可靠依据：过去评奖常因没有明确的具体成绩作依据，使评奖时间耗费很多，且不易正确，现在生产成绩纪录便是功绩最具体最确切的考证，评起来又正确，又省时。
