    [This newspaper's report] The Northeast People's Government Commercial Department's Native Produce Company, in order to solve current problems such as domestic sales of native produce and capital turnover, convened a joint meeting of managers from the Northeast provinces' native produce companies and directly affiliated native produce factories and chicken and duck companies in Harbin earlier this month. The meeting discussed and formulated the native produce purchase plan for the first quarter of this year. The meeting was held from January 7th to the 11th, lasting five days. The meeting focused on discussing the new situation of the development of rural sideline production in the Northeast. In his opening report, Sun, the manager of the Native Produce Company, pointed out: "In the past year, without direct warfare, rural sideline production in the Northeast has made considerable progress, especially after the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued instructions on rural work in the old liberated areas this winter. Under the leadership of local Party and government, rural sideline production has increased significantly. Now that national transportation has been basically restored, the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and between inside and outside the customs is accelerating, and industrial and agricultural production will further develop. State-owned native produce companies are required to undertake more important rural supply and marketing tasks. Only by truly enabling native produce work to play its role as a link connecting industrial and agricultural production can the development of rural sideline production and the increase of purchasing power be guaranteed. To this end, it is determined that the guiding principle of native produce work in 1950 is to develop on a large scale." In accordance with this spirit, the meeting studied and formulated the native produce purchase plan for the entire Northeast in 1950 and the first quarter. The plan determined that the variety of purchases should be increased, and the quantity of purchases should be expanded five times compared with 1949. The varieties include export goods such as meat, eggs, bristles, and furs, as well as industrial raw materials such as cotton and hemp. Subsidiary products for domestic sales such as fruits, grass bags, reed mats, peanuts, vermicelli, and even earth alkali, brooms, and willow strips are also included, totaling 105 types. The main ones are export goods and industrial raw materials.
            Procuring State-Needed Materials, Increasing Domestic Sales
    In order to ensure the smooth completion of this plan, the meeting discussed and resolved the main problems in the current native produce work. (1) The issue of domestic sales of native produce: The meeting believes that in order to solve the supply and marketing of rural native produce, the business of native produce companies at all levels should, in addition to purchasing materials needed by the state, also handle domestic sales business, in order to solve the sales problems of certain products by adjusting the supply and demand of native produce in North and South Manchuria and inside and outside the customs. Therefore, it is determined that native produce companies at all levels should increase domestic sales business under the unified planning and leadership of the head office, and change the past operating policy of native produce companies only buying but not selling in the inland. In addition to purchasing, local companies should also complete sales and capital recovery tasks on schedule. (2) The issue of native produce purchase prices: The meeting clearly pointed out: State-owned native produce companies should set native produce prices in accordance with the exchange of materials in urban and rural markets, the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, supporting sideline production, and ensuring sales. Any price that deviates from the above principles and is too high or too low will cause losses to the state and the people. Based on this spirit, the meeting adjusted the current native produce prices and determined that in order to grasp the market and ensure the completion of tasks, a price reporting network should be established in various concentrated production areas of native produce, and the native produce departments in key areas should report to the Northeast Native Produce Company regularly, accurately, and promptly, so that the head office can uniformly lead the native produce market prices.
            Signing Purchase and Sales Contracts for Planned Purchases
    (3) Acquisition methods: The meeting reviewed the past phenomenon of indiscriminate acquisition in various regions, regardless of the regional production characteristics, sales channels and quantity, resulting in blind production by the masses. For example, grass bags, reed mats, etc., which are not needed in large quantities, were arranged for purchase in one province or throughout the whole region, causing mat producers to misunderstand the direction of current sideline production. After mass production, the state had already stopped purchasing, causing huge losses due to stagnant sales. Therefore, the meeting determined that in the future, when purchasing native produce, in addition to common products such as meat, eggs, and hides, which can be purchased simultaneously in various regions, different types of native produce should be purchased in accordance with local production conditions and state needs, in a planned and focused manner, in conjunction with local rural supply and marketing cooperatives, and through short-term contracts, to reduce the losses caused by blind production. The meeting also discussed the preferential rate for various native products purchased through cooperatives. (4) Accelerating capital turnover: In response to the phenomenon that native produce companies at all levels frequently suffer from cash and commodity backlog due to the lack of strict capital management systems, resulting in waste of state funds, the meeting proposed a method for companies at all levels to hand over cash for procurement to the state bank for safekeeping and supervision, and stipulated quotas for the amount of cash in stock and the quantity and time limit for purchased goods in stock for companies at all levels. If the amount exceeds the quota, cash interest and commodity storage fees should be paid within the company's capital item, in order to reduce backlog and promote the turnover of state funds.
            Implement Bristle Unified Purchase and Control Purchase Prices
    (5) Implement the policy of unified purchase of hog bristles: Although the native produce company has achieved some success in implementing the government's unified purchase of hog bristles in the past eight months, the smuggling of hog bristles is still very serious, resulting in the loss of a large amount of national wealth. The meeting proposed that state-owned native produce companies at all levels should not only cooperate with local tax authorities to strengthen anti-smuggling efforts and uniformly control hog bristle purchase prices, but also strengthen publicity to the masses on the significance of the unified purchase of hog bristles, and especially put forward the work of managing urban slaughterhouses to uniformly purchase hog bristles. In areas with cooperatives, purchases should be made through cooperatives. In areas where cooperatives have not been established, merchants can be given certificates to purchase hog bristles on behalf of the state in a certain area within a certain period, so as to implement the state's unified purchase policy. (6) The issue of technical cadres for native produce purchase: The meeting determined that before each large-scale native produce purchase season, native produce companies in each province can run training courses for technical personnel as needed, combined with the arrangement of purchase tasks, for regular training. After the purchase is completed, a summary meeting will be held to cooperate with the inspection of the work. On the other hand, the Native Produce General Factory and Chicken and Duck Company are responsible for rotating training a certain number of technical cadres in each province in their daily work, to ensure that technical problems in purchasing are basically resolved within one year.

    东北召开土产会议确定今年购销计划
    收购品种增多数量增大五倍
    【本报讯】东北人民政府商业部土产公司为解决当前土产内销、资金周转等问题，曾于本月上旬于哈市召开东北各省土产公司与直属土产总厂、鸡鸭公司经理人员联席会议。讨论和制订本年第一季土产收购计划。该会于一月七日召开，到十一日结束，历时五天，在会议上着重讨论了东北农村副业生产发展的新情况，土产公司孙经理在会议开幕报告中指出：“年余来，东北在没有直接战争的情况下，农村副业有了长足发展，特别是去年中共中央东北局对于老区今冬农村工作的指示发出后，经各地党政领导，农村副业生产有显著的增加，在此全国交通已基本恢复，城乡内外物资加速交流，工农业生产将进一步发展的情况下，要求国营土产公司负起更重大的农村供销任务，只有使土产工作做到真正发挥其连接工农业生产的纽带作用，农村副业的发展与购买力的提高才能得到保证。为此确定一九五○年土产工作是大量发展的方针。”会议根据这一精神研讨与制定了一九五○年度及第一季全东北土产收购计划。计划确定要使收购品种增加，收购数量要较一九四九年扩大五倍。品种除包括肉、蛋、鬃、毛皮等出口物资及棉、麻工业原料外，供内地销售的副产如水果、草袋、苇席、花生、粉条，甚至土碱、扫帚、柳条等也包括在内，总计收购达一百零五种。其中主要的是出口物资与工业原料。
            采购国家需用物资，增办内销
    为保证这一计划的顺利完成，会议对当前土产工作中的主要问题作了讨论与决议。（一）土产内销问题：会议认为为解决农村土产的供销，各级土产公司的业务除采购国家需用物资外，还应办理内销业务，以在调剂南北满与关内外土产供求中解决某些产品的销路问题。因此确定各级土产公司，在总公司统一的计划与领导下增加内销业务，改变过去土产公司在内地只买不卖的经营方针，各地公司除采购外也要按期完成推销与回笼任务。（二）土产收购价格问题：会议明确指出：国营土产公司应根据城乡内外市场物资交流情况及公私兼顾、扶助副业生产、保证销路的原则，规定土产价格。凡脱离上述原则过高或过低的规定价格，都会造成国家与人民的损失。根据这一精神会议对现在的土产价格做了调整，并确定：为了掌握市场保证任务的完成，在各个不同的土产集中生产地区建立物价通报网，及各重点地区土产部门及时准确地定期向东北土产公司报告的制度，便于统一由总公司领导土产市价。
            订立购销合同有计划的收购
    （三）收购方法：会议检讨过去在收购中曾有不顾地区生产特点及销路、数量，普遍地平均地在各地收购，造成群众盲目生产的现象。如草袋、苇席等本来需要量并不大，但也在一省或全境布置收购，致使席户误解为目前副业生产的方向，待大量生产后国家早已停止购买，造成销路停滞的巨大损失。因此会议确定今后收购土产时除带普遍性的产品如肉、蛋、皮张等可在各地同时收购外，对不同种类的土产要按照当地生产条件与国家需要，有计划有重点地结合当地农村供销合作社以短期合同办法进行收购，减少因盲目生产所造成的损失。会议同时也讨论了各种土产通过合作社收买的优待率问题。（四）加速资金周转：会议针对目前各级土产公司因缺乏严格的资金管理制度而经常发生现金与商品积压，浪费国家资金的现象，提出了各级公司采购现金统交国家银行保管、监督使用的办法，并规定各级公司收购现金库存额及已购商品库存数量及期限的定额，如额过定额时，即在该单位资金项内交纳现金利息及商品保管费用，以减少积压促进国家资金周转。
            贯彻猪鬃统购掌握收购价格
    （五）贯彻猪鬃统购政策：八个月来土产公司执行政府统购猪鬃工作虽有成绩，但目前猪鬃走私外运仍很严重，损失了大量国家财富。会议提出国营各级土产公司除配合地方税务机关加强缉私，统一掌握猪鬃收购价格外，还要加强向群众宣传猪鬃统购的意义，并特别提出管理城镇屠宰场统购猪鬃的工作。在有合作社的地方通过合作社购买，没有建立合作社的地区可给予商贩在一定期间一定地区内代购猪鬃的证明，通过其代购，以贯彻国家统购政策。（六）土产收购技术干部问题，会议确定在每一大量土产收购季节前，各省土产公司可按照需要由各省开办技术人员训练班，结合布置收购任务，作定期训练。收购结束后再召开总结会议，配合工作的检查。另一方面由土产总厂及鸡鸭公司负责在日常工作中给各省轮训一定数量的技术干部，保证收购技术问题在一年内得到基本解决。
