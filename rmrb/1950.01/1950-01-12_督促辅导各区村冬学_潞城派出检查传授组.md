Supervising and Guiding Winter Literacy Schools in All Districts and Villages: Lucheng Sends Inspection and Teaching Teams

[Shanxi News] The Lucheng Winter Literacy School Committee has dispatched "Winter Literacy School Inspection and Teaching Teams" to various districts and villages to supervise and guide the work of the winter literacy schools. According to inspections: the winter literacy schools in twelve villages, including Wulihou, Chengjiachuan, and Xiliu in this county, have all democratically established rules for leave, make-up classes, and examinations. In learning, Party members and League members have also played an exemplary role in uniting the masses to learn. Party members in Xitiangong Village have set a plan that each person will learn 200 to 300 new characters this winter, striving to eliminate illiteracy within three years. Many village cadres take on teaching roles; the Chinese Communist Party branch secretary of Shenquan Village lectures on central work, doctors give hygiene lessons, and volunteer teachers only teach cultural subjects. However, at present, many village winter literacy schools also have shortcomings such as coercion, formalism, and dogmatism. For example, when mobilizing the masses to attend winter literacy schools in Manliuling in the Third District, it was said: "No one can go out to produce; everyone must stay at home and attend winter literacy schools." Zhangzhuang Village in the Fifth District stipulates that one absence will result in criticism; two absences will result in a fine of four liang of oil; and three absences will result in a fine of one dou of coal. Some volunteer teachers, because they are unprepared before class, do not know what to say, or want to finish all the things they learned in the county at once. In this way, the masses become impatient, the teachers also feel distressed, and fewer and fewer people attend classes. In addition, from the county to the village, there is no specific teaching plan, only a plan for what courses to teach, without a clear understanding of what problems to solve for the masses. Now, in response to the above shortcomings, the Winter Literacy School Inspection and Teaching Team stipulates that volunteer teachers will gather in the district once every seven days to be taught, and the weekly teaching content will be specifically arranged.

    督促辅导各区村冬学
    潞城派出检查传授组
    【山西讯】潞城冬学委员会派出“冬学检查传授组”，分赴各区村督促、辅导冬学工作。据检查：该县五里后、成家川、西流等十二个村的冬学，均用民主方式，订出了请假、补课、测验等规则。学习中，党员、团员也都起了团结群众学习的模范作用。西天贡村党员订了计划，今冬每人要识二百至三百个生字，争取在三年内消除文盲。不少村干部分工任教，神泉村由中共支书讲中心工作，请医生上卫生课，义务教员只讲文化课。但目前也有不少村冬学存在着强迫命令、形式主义及教条主义等缺点。如三区漫流岭发动群众上冬学时说：“谁也不能出门去生产，都在家里上冬学”。五区张庄村规定了一次不来批评；二次不来罚油四两；三次不来罚一斗煤。有些义务教员因课前没准备，不知该说些什么，或者想拿县里学到的东西一下讲完，这样，群众不耐烦，教员也苦恼，听课人就愈来愈少了。此外，从县到村，没具体教学计划，只计划了讲些什么课，没有明确认识到要解决群众一些什么问题。现冬学检查传授组针对上述缺点，规定七天在区集合义务教员传授一次，具体布置每周的教学内容。
