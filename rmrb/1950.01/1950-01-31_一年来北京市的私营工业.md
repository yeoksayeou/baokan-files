Beijing's private industry, long under the oppression and devastation of imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and their concentrated expression in the Kuomintang reactionary rule, suffered seriously. It was on its last legs, barely surviving. The vast majority were light industries or manufacturers of consumer goods. Only a small portion were machine manufacturing and other means of production manufacturers, and these were very scattered, small in scale, and weak in strength. At the beginning of liberation, according to surveys, among the city's twenty-one industries (excluding general handicrafts and special handicrafts), factories with five or fewer people accounted for about 67% of the total, while those with 50 or more people accounted for less than 1%. Nearly half of these factories had no machinery at all, and only one-fifth used power. Before liberation, most were in a state of semi-shutdown, with about a quarter being completely shut down.

In the past year since liberation, under the leadership of state-owned enterprises, especially with the restoration and development of state-owned raw material industries (such as yarn, steel, etc.), power enterprises, fuel enterprises, and railway transportation industries, the general trend is that most have been restored, and some industries have developed. The number of private industrial households in December 1949 increased by 51.08% compared to February, and the number of employees increased by 47.05%. The total electricity consumption of both public and private industries in 1949 increased by 12.8% compared to 1948, and the average monthly consumption in December increased by 99.38% compared to 1948.

If we analyze by industry, we can see that the industries that have developed more significantly and steadily are machine manufacturing and iron industries needed for production, and the flour industry and weaving and dyeing industries necessary for the lives of urban and rural people. These are followed by kiln, knitting, rubber, and soap industries. These industries have increased in the number of factories, employees, and output compared to the average figures for the whole of 1948. The paper industry suffered from insufficient raw materials, the match industry suffered from backward technology, high costs, and low quality, and the leather industry missed the season due to slow production cycles. Therefore, the output of these three industries last year did not increase compared to 1948, but they all increased the number of factories or added production equipment, and the trend of development is still obvious. Only soda water, foreign wine, which are not currently necessary for the people, and the carpet industry, which has a market abroad, have reduced their production scale.

This process of recovery and development is tortuous and is advancing through overcoming numerous difficulties.

At the beginning of liberation, many capitalists did not understand the people's government's industrial and commercial policies and had many ideological concerns. Some even evaded funds and reduced business. Factories that had stopped production took a wait-and-see attitude and delayed resuming work. After various publicity explanations and practical support, the market gradually expanded, and they gradually resumed work. From February to April 1949, most industries were in the stage of resuming work. In the process of resuming work, it can be seen that small factories had fewer concerns and resumed work faster than larger factories. Industries related to people's livelihood necessities (such as the flour industry) recovered faster than other industries. In the process of resuming work, the call to "transform consumer cities into production cities" played a role.

After May, Beijing's industrial production began to get on the right track. Several important industries have also made considerable progress. Let's analyze the reasons for the development:

First, because the restrictions of bureaucratic capital and the dumping of imperialist commodities were removed, and the long-isolated relationship between urban and rural areas was unblocked, facing the vast rural market of peaceful production after the land reform in the liberated areas, there was a market for commodities. For example, the most significant development was in the flour industry, because there was no dumping of American and Australian flour and no price restrictions. The source of raw materials was available, and the total output increased by more than double compared to last year. The total sales of rural production tools such as rice milling, threshing, and cotton ginning machines increased by one-fold. The remaining weaving and dyeing, knitting, and other industries have also developed because of the removal of the invasion of imperialist commodities, the expansion of the urban and rural markets, and the communication of trade in the Northwest and other regions. Because of the development of necessary consumer goods industries, it in turn caused the development of machine tool manufacturing and means of production manufacturing. Secondly, the progress of national construction undertakings has led to an increase in state orders, which has also given a considerable stimulus to private production, such as the Ministry of Railways' orders for the machine and iron industry and public construction orders for the kiln industry.

Second, because we have implemented correct industrial and commercial policies and labor-capital policies, and given many specific help and support to private industry. In April last year, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held symposiums of private factory workers and capitalists respectively, explaining the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital and developing production. The capitalists said, "This makes production easier," removing the capitalists' concerns about developing production. In June, the municipal government held an industrial production exhibition, and then organized trade groups to go to the Northeast and Northwest, which played a significant role in communicating urban and rural trade and opening up the sales of Beijing's industrial products. In the same month, the Labor Bureau was established and began to systematically adjust labor-capital relations by signing collective contracts. The Second People's Representative Conference of All Circles also adopted measures to dismiss and relieve unemployed workers, on the one hand, protecting the lives of workers, and on the other hand, enabling factories with operating difficulties to avoid hindering the development of production due to dismissal disputes. Secondly, in terms of taxation, the principle of taxing industry lighter than commerce, means of production and means of production manufacturing lighter than consumer goods manufacturing, and necessities lighter than non-necessities was adopted. The implementation of the above series of policies has had a decisive impact on protecting and rewarding the development of private industry.

In addition, state-owned banks and trade agencies have also given many specific support to private industry. The banks have loaned 3,536,880,000 yuan to private factories in one year, lending to 363 households. Although the amount is not large, it has helped many factories solve the difficulties of capital turnover and add production equipment. Trade companies supply raw materials, purchase finished products, and place orders, which have a significant impact on the vitality of production in many industries. Such as supplying yarn to the weaving and dyeing industry and knitting industry, supplying wheat to the flour industry, supplying tobacco leaves to the cigarette industry, and supplying rubber to the rubber industry. Some of them have signed "processing" contracts, which has enabled some private industries to begin to embark on the road of state capitalism.

Without the implementation of these correct policies and the support of state-owned banks and trade agencies, it would have been impossible for Beijing's original very weak private industry before liberation to achieve such recovery and development as it has today.

From the development in 1949, we can see several trends: First, all industries that meet the needs of production and the lives of the vast urban and rural people have been restored and developed. The more needs there are, the more development there is, such as machine and iron industry, flour industry, weaving and dyeing industry, etc. Conversely, those that are not currently needed by the vast people, such as foreign wine, soda water, etc., tend to decline. Second, machine production develops and manual production declines in the same industry, such as the development of electric machine weaving and the decline of manual machine weaving; the development of machine dyeing and the decline of earth dyeing. Therefore, in the weaving industry, some have changed from manual machines to electric machines. Third, the trend from commercial to industrial management has begun. For example, in the machine weaving industry, three companies have switched from commercial, but it is not yet common. Fourth, the connection with state-owned trade agencies is becoming increasingly close, and the portion processed for state-owned trade agencies is increasing. For example, the portion of machine-made flour industry processed for trade companies has increased from 17.5% of the total output in March 1949 to 70.1% in December. Fifth, small factories have adopted the method of joint operations to unite from scattered small operations into larger operations to improve quality, reduce costs, and solve some difficulties in production and sales.

The above trends are all in line with our needs for developing production. This proves the success of our policies, and we need to continue to move forward in this direction. But this is not to say that our work has no problems and no shortcomings. On the contrary, we still have many shortcomings and difficulties that need to be overcome: First, in private industry, the phenomenon of blind production is still very serious. In order to overcome this phenomenon, planned guidance should be given to private industry, and banks, trade agencies, and cooperatives should cooperate to overcome this blindness. Second, it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance and commodity inspection, reduce costs and improve quality, so that finished products meet standards and needs. This is the basic key to opening up sales. Third, some problems and difficulties in raw material supply should be overcome as much as possible by public and private efforts. Fourth, it is necessary to continue to adjust some labor-capital relations that still need to be adjusted. Fifth, in addition to state-owned banks lending a portion of funds to give appropriate support to industries that are of great significance to production, the main reliance should be on diverting idle funds and a portion of commercial capital to production.

    一年来北京市的私营工业
    北京市人民政府研究室
    北京市的私营工业，由于长期处在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义及其集中表现的国民党反动统治下，遭受了严重的压迫与摧残，奄奄一息，朝不保夕，其中绝大多数为轻工业或生活消费品的制造业，仅有一小部分机器制造业和其他生产资料的制造业，并且是十分分散的，规模甚小、力量微弱。解放之初，据调查，全市二十一个行业（一般手工业和特种手工业不在内）中，五人以下的厂家约占总数的百分之六七，而五○人以上的不足百分之一。其中近半数厂家根本无机器设备，使用动力的不过五分之一，解放前夕大都陷于半停顿状态，停工者约有四分之一。
    解放一年来私营工业在公营企业领导之下，特别是在公营的原料工业（如纱、钢铁等），动力企业、燃料企业和铁路交通工业的恢复与发展的条件下，总的趋势是绝大部分业已恢复，而部分行业发展了。私营工业户数在一九四九年十二月较比二月份增加了五一·○八％，职工人数增加了四七·○五％，一九四九年全年公私工业合计用电量较一九四八年增加了一二·八％，十二月份比一九四八年每月平均量增加了九九·三八％。
    如果按行业加以分析，可以看出，发展较大较稳固的是生产所需要的机器制造业、铁工业和城乡人民生活所必需的面粉业、织染业。其次是窑业、针织、橡胶、肥皂等业。这些行业，较比一九四八年全年的平均数字，在厂数、职工数和产量方面都增加了。造纸业因为原料不足，火柴业因为技术落后成本高，质量低，制革业因为生产周期缓慢误了季节，因此，这三个行业，去年一年的产量较比一九四八年没有提高，但也都增加了厂数，或增加了生产设备，其发展的趋向仍是明显的。只有非人民当前所必需的汽水、洋酒，和市场在国外的地毡业，缩小了生产规模。
    这个恢复与发展的过程是曲折的，是在克服重重困难中前进的。
    在解放之初，许多资本家不明了人民政府的工商业政策，有很多思想顾虑，有的甚至逃避资金，缩小营业，已停的厂家持观望态度，延不复工。经过多方面的宣传解释和实际的扶植，市场逐渐扩大，才陆续复工，从一九四九年二月到四月，多数行业都在复工的阶段。在复工的过程中，可以看出小厂顾虑少，复工较大厂快，有关民生必需品（如面粉业）的行业比其他行业恢复得快。在复工过程中，“变消费城市为生产城市”的号召是起了作用的。
    五月以后北京市的工业生产开始走上了正常的轨道。有若干重要的行业还有了相当的发展。分析一下发展的原因：
    第一、是因为除去了官僚资本的限制和帝国主义的商品倾销，沟通了多年来隔绝的城乡关系，面对着解放区土改以后和平生产的广大农村市场，商品有了销路，比如发展最显著的面粉业，因为没有了美澳粉的倾销和限价的影响，原料有了来源，总产量较去年增加了一倍多，农村的生产工具碾米、打稻、轧花等机器的销售总量增加了一倍。其余织染、针织等业也都因为去掉了帝国主义商品的侵略，扩大了城乡市场，沟通了西北及其他各地的贸易，而得到了发展。因为必要的消费品工业的发展，又从而引起机器工具制造业和生产资料制造业的发展。其次，由于国家建设事业的进行使国家订货随之增多，也给了私营生产以不小的刺激，如铁道部对机器铁工业的订货，公共建筑方面对窑业的订货等。
    第二、是因为我们执行了正确的工商业政策和劳资政策，对私营工业给了许多具体的帮助和扶植。去年四月中共北京市委分别召开了私营工厂工人和资本家代表的座谈会，解释了劳资两利、发展生产的方针，资本家表示“这样对生产就好办了”，去掉了资本家对发展生产的顾虑。六月市政府举行工业生产展览会，随即组织了贸易小组去东北和西北，这对于沟通城乡贸易，打开北京市工业产品的销路上，起了很大作用。同月劳动局成立并开始用签订集体合同的办法来有系统地调整劳资关系，第二届各界人民代表会议上又通过了解雇和救济失业工人的办法，一方面保障了工人的生活，一方面使经营困难的厂家免去因解雇纠纷而妨碍了生产的发展。其次在税收方面，采取了工业轻于商业，生产工具及生产资料的制造业轻于生活资料制造业、必需品轻于非必需品的征税原则。以上这一系列的政策的实施，对于保护和奖励私营工业的发展是有决定性的影响的。
    此外，国家银行和贸易机关对私营工业也给予了许多具体的扶植，计银行在一年内给私营厂家贷款三五三、六八八万元，贷给了三六三户，虽然数量不大，却帮助许多厂家解决了资金周转的困难，添置了生产设备。贸易公司供给原料，收购成品和订货，对许多行业生产的活跃有着重大影响。如对织染业、针织业供纱、对面粉业供麦、对卷烟业供给烟叶、对橡胶业供给橡胶等。其中有的订立了“加工”合同，使一部分私营工业开始转上了国家资本主义的道路。
    如果没有这些正确政策的实施，和国家银行与贸易机关的扶植，北京市解放前原有的非常孱弱的私营工业，想得到像今天这样的恢复与发展是不可能的。
    从一九四九年的发展当中，我们可以看出几个趋向：第一、凡合于生产需要，和城乡广大人民的生活所必需的工业，都得到了恢复和发展，需要愈多的发展也愈多，如机器铁工业、面粉业、织染业等。反之凡是当前广大人民所不需要的，如洋酒、汽水等业则趋向衰落。第二、同一行业机器生产发展，手工生产衰落，如电力机织业发展，人力机织业衰落；机染业发展，土染业衰落。因而在织布业中，有的已由人力机改为电力机。第三、从商业转向工业经营的趋势业已开始，比如机织业中就有三家是由商业方面转来的，但是还不普遍。第四、与国家贸易机关的联系日渐密切，为国家贸易机关加工的部分日益增多，如机制面粉业为贸易公司加工的部分已由一九四九年三月占总产量的一七·五％，增至十二月占总产量的七○·一％。第五、小厂家采取联营的办法从分散的小经营联合为较大的经营以提高质量减低成本，解决了产销方面的某些困难。
    以上这几个趋向，都是合乎我们发展生产的需要的，这证明了我们的政策的成功，我们还需要照着这个方向继续前进。但这不是说我们的工作已经没有问题没有缺点了，相反的，我们还有许多缺点和困难需要继续克服：第一、在私营工业当中，盲目生产的现象还非常严重，为了克服这种现象，对私营工业作有计划的指导，银行贸易机关和合作社应配合一致克服这种盲目性。第二、要加强技术指导和商品检验，减低成本提高质量，使成品合乎标准和需要，这是打开销路的基本关键。第三、原料供给中的一些问题与困难要由公私合力尽可能地加以克服。第四、要继续调整若干尚须调整的劳资关系。第五、生产资金，除了国家银行贷给一部分款项，对生产上有重要意义的行业予以适当的扶植外，主要的应依靠疏导游资和一部分商业资本转向生产。（附图表）
