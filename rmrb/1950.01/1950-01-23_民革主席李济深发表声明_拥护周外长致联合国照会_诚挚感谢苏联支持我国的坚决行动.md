Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 22nd: Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, issued the following statement in support of Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram to the United Nations on January 20th:

    On the 20th of this month, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, telegraphed Mr. Romulo, President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, and forwarded it to the delegations of all member states of the Security Council, continuing to point out that the remnant reactionary group of the Chinese Kuomintang remaining in the United Nations Security Council is illegal and unreasonable. He advocated immediately expelling them and inquired when the delegation of the People's Republic of China, with Zhang Wentian as its chief representative, could attend the meetings of the United Nations and its Security Council and participate in the work, hoping for a reply. His words were righteous and stern, fully representing the public opinion of the entire Chinese people, and resolutely supported by the entire Chinese people.

    Amidst the fierce protests from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and world progressive public opinion against the United Nations Security Council's continued tolerance of the representative of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group, I would like to reiterate the statement on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. The first thing I want to call the world's attention to is that the so-called "Chinese National Government" delegation dispatched by Jiang Tingfu, which is still staging a historical farce in the United Nations, cannot represent China and, apart from being driven by bandits such as Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren, cannot represent the Chinese people, because China today only has the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and there is no "Chinese National Government." The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group has long been driven out of mainland China and is fleeing in Taiwan as pirates. In any sense, they can no longer be called members of international organizations. The People's Republic of China has established the Central People's Government, established the people's governments of various provinces and cities, liberated and unified all regions of the country except Taiwan, Tibet, and Hainan Island, and holds national power, and is supported by 475 million people across the country. It has already met the requirements of international law and the "letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter" and has become a newly emerging independent people's democratic country in the world. I hope that the member states of the United Nations can recognize this fact as clearly as the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, immediately revoke the qualifications of the Chiang Tingfu delegation, and invite the legitimate delegation with Zhang Wentian as its chief to attend the meetings of the United Nations and its Security Council and participate in the work in order to comply with the wishes of the Chinese people.

    Here, I would like to express my warm and sincere gratitude to our friendly country, the Soviet Union. Its delegation, with resolute action, supported the statement of Foreign Minister Zhou of our country, and in the Security Council, together with the new democratic countries, denied this illegal ghost delegation, and withdrew from the meeting one after another, expressing a just and powerful attitude. At the same time, I want to sternly warn the US imperialist group not to manipulate and play with the United Nations anymore, and treat it as a tool to obstruct people's democracy and world lasting peace. This will cause unfortunate consequences for which the United States should be responsible. As for other countries, on the one hand, they have openly requested to establish diplomatic relations with the new China, and on the other hand, they openly or actually support the illegal Chiang Tingfu delegation in the Security Council. This is an act of being disloyal to their own international obligations, and we cannot agree to it.

    Finally, we ask the United Nations and the member states of its Security Council to accept the requirements of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's repeated statements, respond to the appeal of the Soviet representative's sympathy and support, take action, and quickly expel the representatives of the reactionary remnant group of the Chinese Kuomintang from the United Nations, and invite the legal delegation of the People's Republic of China to participate in the work, so as to maintain the dignity of the United Nations and its member states. I hereby solemnly make this important statement again on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

    民革主席李济深发表声明
    拥护周外长致联合国照会
    诚挚感谢苏联支持我国的坚决行动
    【新华社北京二十二日电】中国国民党革命委员会李主席济深为拥护周外长一月二十日致联合国的电报，发表谈话如下：
    本月二十日，我国外交部周恩来部长致电联合国大会主席罗慕洛，联合国秘书长赖伊，并转安全理事会各会员国代表团，继续指出中国国民党反动残余集团留在联合国安全理事会中是不合法不合理的，主张立刻将他们开除出去，并询问以张闻天为首席代表的中华人民共和国代表团何时可以出席联合国及其安全理事会的会议和参加工作，望予答复，义正辞严，完全代表中国全体人民的公意，并为中国全体人民所坚决拥护的。
    在我国各民主党派、各人民团体以及世界进步舆论猛烈抗议联合国安全理事会至今仍容留国民党反动残余集团代表这样正义呼声中，本人谨再代表中国国民党革命委员会发表声明。我首先要唤起世界注意的：目前仍在联合国中排演历史丑剧的所谓“中国国民政府”所派遣的蒋廷黻代表团确已不可能代表中国，除了供蒋介石、李宗仁等匪帮驱使外，也不可能代表中国人，因为中国今日只有中华人民共和国中央人民政府，并无“中国国民政府”的存在。蒋介石反动集团早已被驱出了中国大陆，逃亡在台湾做海盗，在任何意义上，他们已不能称为国际组织中之一员。中华人民共和国已创建了中央人民政府，成立了各省市人民政府，解放了、统一了全国除台湾、西藏、海南岛以外的地区，掌握着全国性的政权，被全国四亿七千五百万人民所拥戴，实已符合国际公法与“联合国宪章的文字与精神”，而成为世界上新起的独立的人民民主国家。我希望联合国各会员国能和苏联及新民主主义国家一样，清晰地认识这个事实，立即取消蒋廷黻代表团资格，邀请以张闻天为首席的合法代表团出席联合国及其安全理事会的各项会议，参加工作，以符合中国人民的愿望。
    我在这里要热烈诚挚地感谢友邦苏联，它的代表团以坚决的行动支持了我国周外长的声明，在安全理事会中又与各新民主主义国家，否认这个非法的鬼影代表团，并先后退出会议，表示正义的有力的态度。同时，我要严正警告美帝国主义者集团，勿再操纵玩弄联合国，把它当做阻挠人民民主和世界持久和平的工具。这将引起应由美国负责的不幸的后果。至于另外一些国家，一面曾公开要求与新中国建立外交关系，一面又在安全理事会中公开地或实际地支持蒋廷黻非法代表团，这是不忠实于自己的国际义务的行为，我们是不能同意的。
    最后，我们要求联合国及其安理会各会员国接受周恩来外长迭次声明的要求，响应苏联代表同情支持的号召，有所行动，迅速驱逐中国国民党反动残余集团代表出联合国，并邀请中华人民共和国的合法代表团参加工作，这样才能保持联合国及其会员国的尊严。我谨代表中国国民党革命委员会郑重地再作这一次重要的声明。
