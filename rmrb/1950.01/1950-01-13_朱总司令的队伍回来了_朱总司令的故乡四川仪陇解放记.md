"Commander-in-Chief Zhu's Troops Have Returned"
The Liberation of Yilong, Sichuan, Commander-in-Chief Zhu's Hometown

    On the 23rd of last month, the vanguard troops of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Northern Sichuan front crossed the Bashan Mountains and entered the territory of Yilong County. The commanders and fighters were particularly excited because the Ma'an field in Yilong County is the hometown of Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Large banners were hung in the propaganda sheds along both sides of the road: "Resolutely implement Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order to advance and wipe out the remaining enemies." The loudspeakers of each company broadcast loudly: "Fear no fatigue, advance bravely, and liberate Commander-in-Chief Zhu's hometown!" The soldiers reviewed whether their plans to perform meritorious service in the Sichuan campaign had been fulfilled, and requested to be the vanguard, guaranteeing to capture the enemy.

    The vanguard company, led by People's Merit Citation recipient Company Commander Yan Guanchao, advanced rapidly through the night, covering over 30 *li* in just over an hour. At dawn, they arrived at Bamiao field and defeated a regiment of the enemy. When the people in the Bamiao field area saw the cap badges with the five-pointed star on the troops, they knew that the People's Liberation Army had arrived. Groups of men, women, and children immediately came out of their homes and flocked to the main road to set off firecrackers to welcome them. Young men excitedly ran to nearby villages to spread the news: "The People's Liberation Army is here!" "Commander-in-Chief Zhu has returned!" More people gathered around. Some elderly people and women came from afar to inquire whether their sons and husbands who had followed the Red Army on the Long March more than ten years ago had also returned. People happily discussed: "I knew at first glance that Commander-in-Chief Zhu's Red Army had returned." "The People's Liberation Army is different from the Kuomintang army. Those *Chai Lao Er* (referring to bandits) ransacked houses and beat and scolded people as soon as they entered the street. The People's Liberation Army is always kind and orderly, and doesn't even enter the homes of ordinary people to ask for a drink."

    The troops marched continuously for more than 100 *li* and arrived at the outskirts of Yilong City at 2 PM that day. The enemy garrison, the guard battalion of the pseudo-Shaanxi Security Command, knowing that they were unable to resist, surrendered completely after the People's Liberation Army fired only seven shots. Yilong County was liberated.

    As the troops marched into the city, workers, students, and citizens in Xiguan beat gongs and drums and set off firecrackers to welcome them. Young men who had been hiding in the mountains for fear of persecution by the bandit army rushed back and busied themselves finding grain and firewood for the army. Women busily boiled water and delivered it to the troops. As soon as the troops stopped, they were surrounded by the masses, asking whether Commander-in-Chief Zhu had returned. When the troops took out a portrait of Commander-in-Chief Zhu and showed it to everyone, the crowd couldn't help but shout the slogan "Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!" An old gentleman in his seventies looked at the portrait and said, "I haven't seen him for twenty years. The Commander-in-Chief has gotten fatter." Then, an old Mr. Guo told the troops many stories about Commander-in-Chief Zhu's past and the crimes of the Kuomintang bandits in persecuting the people of Yilong. Mr. Guo said passionately at the end: "The Kuomintang bandits dug up Commander-in-Chief Zhu's ancestral grave and beat and buried many ordinary people alive, but the people were not intimidated by the reactionaries. Today, Commander-in-Chief Zhu's troops have returned again."

    The troops had to continue pursuing the enemy and could not stay for long, so they wrote a letter expressing their condolences to the elders and villagers of Ma'an field, Commander-in-Chief Zhu's hometown.

    “朱总司令的队伍回来了”
    朱总司令的故乡四川仪陇解放记
    上月二十三日，川北前线人民解放军某部的先遣部队越过巴山，进入仪陇县境。指战员们特别兴奋起来，因为仪陇县的马鞍场就是朱总司令的故乡。公路两旁的鼓动棚里悬挂起大幅标语：“坚决执行朱总司令的进军命令肃清残敌”，各连队的喇叭筒大声广播着：“不怕疲劳，奋勇前进，解放朱总司令的故乡。”战士们检讨着自己进军四川的立功计划是否已经做到，并纷纷向首长要求当前卫，保证抓住敌人。
    由人民功臣阎冠朝连长率领的前卫连星夜急进，一个多钟头走了三十来里，天明时赶到八庙场打垮了敌人的一个团。八庙场一带的人民一看到部队戴着五角星的帽徽，知道是解放军来了，成群的男女老少立即从家里走出来，拥到大路上去燃放鞭炮迎接。年青的小伙子们兴奋地向附近各村庄奔走传告：“解放军来了！”“朱总司令回来了！”更多的人汇聚了拢来，有些老人家和妇女远道赶来探问，看他们十多年前随着红军长征的儿子和丈夫是不是也跟着回来了。人们欣喜地谈论着：“我一看就知道是朱总司令的红军回来了。”“解放军和国民党军队就是不一样，那些柴老二（即土匪）一进街就翻箱倒柜，打人骂人，解放军总是和和气气，规规矩矩，找口水喝都不进老百姓的大门。”
    部队连续行进百余里，当天下午二时就抵达仪陇城郊。守敌伪陕西保安司令部警卫营自知无力拒抗，在解放军仅仅打了七枪之后，就全部缴械了，仪陇县城即告解放。
    当部队向城内开进时，西关的工人、学生、市民成群地打起锣鼓，放着鞭炮前来欢迎。因害怕匪军迫害而隐藏起来的青年男人从山里赶回来，忙着给军队找粮找柴，妇女们纷纷给部队烧茶送水。部队一停下来，就被群众团团围住，打听朱总司令回来了没有。当部队拿出一张朱总司令的半身像片给大家看时，人群中情不自禁地喊出“朱总司令万岁”的口号。一位七十多岁的老先生看了像片后说：“二十年没有见面了，总司令越发胖啦。”接着，一位郭老先生向部队谈了许多关于朱总司令的往事和国民党匪帮迫害仪陇人民的罪行。郭老先生最后激昂地说：“国民党匪徒把朱总司令的祖坟掘了，把许多老百姓打死活埋了，可是老百姓并没有被反动派吓倒，今天朱总司令的队伍又回来了。”
    部队要继续追击敌人，不能久停，特写了一封信向朱总司令故乡马鞍场的父老表示慰问。
