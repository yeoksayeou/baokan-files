Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 31st: The people's representative conferences in counties, cities, and small towns in the North China region were generally held in October and mid-November. The focus of discussions at the people's representative conferences in various counties, cities, and towns was on developing the production campaign for this winter and next spring, implementing land reform, and taxation issues. As the representatives attending the conferences actively conveyed the conference resolutions and assisted in their implementation after the meetings, work in various places has been further advanced.

        Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises Actively Resuming Production
    The people's representative conferences held in 63 counties including Taiyuan City, Yangquan Mining Area, and Changzhi in Shanxi Province generally discussed the New Democratic economic policies, and some also made resolutions on winter production. After the first session of the second Taiyuan Municipal People's Representative Conference, the representatives universally conveyed the government's policy of protecting industry and commerce, thus dispelling the concerns of some private industrialists and merchants and encouraging them to actively expand their businesses. In less than a month, private industrial and commercial enterprises increased by 227. At the same time, industrialists and merchants had a further understanding of the government's difficulties and their own obligations. When collecting the third quarter industrial and commercial tax in November, it was all paid in full within five days. After the representatives in the Yangquan Mining Area conveyed the government's policy of restoring the iron industry, many private coal and iron factory owners took out their stored grain as capital, and some went to Tianjin and Shijiazhuang to rent electric motors and purchase water pipes, actively preparing to resume production. At the same time, state-owned coal and iron companies also made appropriate adjustments to the purchase price of coal, helping private coal and iron industries solve some difficulties. As a result, 76 iron industries alone were restored within a month.

        Winter Production Significantly Developed
    Winter production work in various places has also been significantly developed after the people's representative conferences. People's representatives in various counties of the Anyang Special District in Pingyuan Province are working hard to assist in water conservancy projects. The Qi County levee restoration project has been completed rapidly, and the dredging work on the Puji River in Tangyin is underway. People's representatives in the counties under the Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province conveyed the discussions and resolutions of the People's Representative Conference on the issue of production for self-relief, and the confidence of the masses in production for self-relief has been improved. Currently, production for self-relief movements are being launched in various places. After the representatives in Huailai and other places in Chahar Province returned to their villages, they actively cooperated with village cadres to carry out mass winter production activities such as collecting firewood and repairing wells. Under the promotion of the representatives, the Chengguan Administrative Village of Fushan, Shanxi Province, accumulated more than 30,000 loads of fertilizer in half a month.

        Various Tasks Proceed Smoothly
    Through the people's representative conferences, the people's governments in various new districts have focused on discussing land reform policies. After the representatives who participated in the People's Representative Conference in Xinxiang County returned to their villages, they widely publicized the land reform policy to the masses. The Kangzhuang Farmers' Association in the county increased by more than 150 members in six or seven days. After the representatives from Tong County in Hebei Province and Shen County in Pingyuan Province publicized the land reform policy of "not touching the middle and leveling the ends," the emotions of the broad middle peasants have become more stable and they have been producing with greater confidence. After the representatives in Yanggao County and other places in Chahar Province returned to their villages and conveyed the policies of issuing land certificates and rewarding production, they resolved the concerns of middle peasants who were afraid of moving the land and the poor peasants who were afraid of not having security after planting crops, resulting in significant achievements in winter production. This year's autumn grain collection work in many counties in Hebei, Chahar, and other provinces has also become fairer and more reasonable due to the discussion and communication of the people's representatives. After the people's representative conferences in fourteen counties and one town in the Shijiazhuang Special District, the autumn grain collection work was faster and smoother than in previous years.

        Great Educational Effect on Cadres and the Masses
    The educational effect on cadres and the people in various places is also very significant. At the People's Representative Conference in Yanggao County, the representatives criticized nine cadres and commended fifteen cadres. The cadres who were criticized made self-criticisms in front of the masses and resolved to correct their shortcomings in their work. The masses further recognized the benefits of the people being the masters of their own affairs and actively put forward their own opinions. After the People's Representative Conference in Yushe County, Shanxi Province, the masses put forward more than 50 suggestions to the resident committee through the representatives.

    However, in some areas, due to insufficient understanding of the People's Representative Conference by the leading cadres, they are still stuck in the old ways of cadre meetings. Therefore, although the meetings were held, the representatives were unable to express their opinions freely, and after the meetings, they did not pay attention to conveying the information. Once the meetings were over, the work was finished. In other areas, the representatives completely replaced the cadres. Various places are correcting these deviations.

    华北各县市召开各界代表会后
    各项工作均向前推进一步
    【新华社北京三十一日电】华北区各县市和中小城镇的各界人民代表会议已于十月及十一月中普遍举行。各县、市、镇各界人民代表会议的讨论中心是发展今冬和明春的生产运动，实行土地改革及税收等问题。由于出席各地会议的代表在开会以后积极传达会议决议并协助其执行，各地工作已推进一步。
            私营工商业积极恢复生产
    山西省太原市、阳泉工矿区及长治等六十三个县召开的各界人民代表会议，一般都讨论了新民主主义的经济政策，有的并作出了冬季生产的决议。太原市二届一次各界人民代表会议召开后，各代表普遍传达了人民政府保护工商业政策，因而消除了某些私营工商业者的顾虑，积极扩大营业。不到一个月中，私营工商业增加了二百二十七家。同时，工商业者对政府的困难及本身的义务也有了进一步的认识，在十一月征收第三季工商税时，五天内即全部缴齐。阳泉工矿区经过各代表传达了政府恢复铁业的方针后，许多私营煤、铁业厂主有的将存粮拿出来作资金，有的到天津、石家庄租用电动机，购买水管等，积极准备恢复生产。同时国营煤铁公司在收购煤价上也作了适当的调整，帮助私营煤铁业解决了一些困难，因而一个月内仅铁业即恢复了七十六家。
            冬季生产显著开展
    各地冬季生产工作在人民代表会议后，也有显著开展。平原省安阳专区各县人民代表都在努力协助兴修水利，淇县复堤工程已迅速完工，汤阴普济河的疏浚工作正进行中。河北省天津专区所属各县人民代表传达了人民代表会议关于生产自救问题的讨论和决议，群众生产自救的信心提高，现各地正展开生产自救运动。察哈尔省怀来等地代表回村后，积极协同村干部进行群众性的打柴、修井等各项冬季生产活动。山西浮山城关行政村在代表们推动下，半个月即积肥三万余担。
            各项工作进行顺利
    新区各县人民政府通过各界代表会议，都着重讨论了土地改革政策。新乡县参加各界人民代表会议的代表回村后，向群众广泛地宣传了土地改革政策。该县康庄农会在六、七天内即增加了一百五十多个会员。河北省通县、平原省莘县等地，经过各界代表宣传“中间不动两头平”的土地改革政策后，广大中农的情绪已更加安定并且放手生产。察哈尔省阳高县等地代表回村后传达了发土地证及奖励生产等政策后，解决了中农害怕动地，贫农也怕种上庄稼没有保障的思想顾虑，使冬季生产收到显著成绩。河北、察哈尔等省不少县份今年的秋征工作，也由于通过各界代表的讨论和传达，进一步做到了公平合理。石家庄专区十四个县和一个镇的秋征工作经过各界人民代表会议后，比较往年都要快而且顺利。
            对干部对群众教育作用很大
    各地对干部和人民群众的教育作用也很大。阳高县各界代表会上，代表们对九个干部提出批评，对十五个干部提出表扬。受到批评的干部都在群众面前作了自我批评，决心改正工作上的缺点。群众由此进一步认识到人民当家做主的好处，积极地提出自己的意见。山西榆社县召开各界人民代表会议后，群众经过各代表向驻会委员会提出了五十几件建议。
    但也有某些地区，由于领导干部对各界代表会议认识不足，仍拘泥于干部会的老一套，因此虽开了会，代表们并未能畅所欲言，会后也不注意去传达，会散了，工作就完了。另有些地区则发生代表完全代替了干部。各地对这些偏向正纠正中。
