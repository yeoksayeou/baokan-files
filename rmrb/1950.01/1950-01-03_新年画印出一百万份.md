Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 2nd. The Publishing Bureau of the General Administration of Publications' plan to print two million New Year pictures is expected to be completed before the Spring Festival. As of now, more than sixty types have been published or finalized after collection and review, more than forty types have been sent to print, about one million copies have been printed, and distribution has begun along the Beijing-Hankou line, in Pingyuan Province, and in southeastern Shanxi. The publishing plan for the remaining one million copies can also be completed in early December of the lunar calendar.

In the creation of this batch of New Year pictures, more than ten traditional Chinese painters from Beijing participated, using their expertise in traditional Chinese painting techniques to depict scenes of the people's new life. In terms of subject matter, this batch of New Year pictures includes current affairs topics (such as celebrating the founding ceremony, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and explaining the Common Program), as well as rural, urban, historical, and internationalist topics (such as farmers in the suburbs of Beijing welcoming Soviet friends). In terms of format, there are large and small square paintings, central hall pictures, vertical panels, and calendar heads (i.e., "stove codes"). In terms of printing, some use the old New Year picture printing method of woodblock color separation, and some use offset printing presses (including both lithographic and collotype printing) with four-color printing in general.
