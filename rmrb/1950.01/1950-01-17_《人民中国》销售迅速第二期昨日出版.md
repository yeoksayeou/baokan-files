"People's China" Sales Rapid, Second Issue Published Yesterday
[This newspaper dispatch] The English-language bi-monthly magazine "People's China" has seen enthusiastic subscriptions and quickly sold out following the publication of its inaugural issue, reflecting the international community's attention to and concern for the new China. The second issue was published on January 16th of this month. Special articles in this issue include: Soong Ching Ling's "The Differences Between Soviet and American Foreign Policy," Mao Dun's "Eastern European Literature in China," Li Lisan's "The Chinese Workers' Movement," and Hu Sheng's "The Tenth Anniversary of On New Democracy." There are also two editorials: one titled "Diplomacy and Friendship," commenting on the recent requests from capitalist countries to establish diplomatic relations with our country, and another titled "Unveiling the Taiwan Smoke Screen," which thoroughly exposes the US-Chiang Kai-shek plot to invade Taiwan and issues a warning. The feature section includes an article on Zhao Guoyou, the labor hero from the Northeast who set new records, and another on Beijing's celebration of the New Year. The pictorial section includes multiple photographs of Beijing celebrating Generalissimo Stalin's birthday, workers' lives, and the Asian Women's Conference.
