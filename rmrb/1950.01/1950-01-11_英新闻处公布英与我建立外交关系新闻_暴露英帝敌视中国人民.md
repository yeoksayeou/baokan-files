Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 9th: Three months and six days after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the British government, following thirteen other countries, announced the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Central People's Government of China "on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territory and sovereignty." If diplomatic relations are indeed established "on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territory and sovereignty," then of course the Chinese people will welcome it. The Chinese people are a nation that understands "reciprocity" and "observing actions after listening to words." Therefore, it can be believed that the Chinese Central People's Government will decide its corresponding steps towards the British government based on the actual actions taken by the British government towards China, rather than its declarations. The Chinese people have fresh memories of the British government's historical record of actions in China. The explanation given by the British Information Service, representing the British government, regarding the British government's establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, particularly evokes this memory among the Chinese people.

	Hostilely equates the New China with the Spanish Fascist government

The British Information Service's London dispatch on the 6th rudely distorted the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China from the outset as the "Chinese Communist Government," and said: "Recognizing a government does not mean approving of its policies, and vice versa. This is the case this time, similar to the situation with the governments of Eastern European countries or Franco's government." Here, British imperialist elements do not hide their instinctive hostility towards the People's Republic of China and all People's Democratic countries, which resolutely oppose imperialism. They hostilely equate the People's Republic of China and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries with the fascist government of Spain. However, it is universally known that Franco's best relatives and unscrupulous supporters are precisely the British government. The British Information Service continued: "As announced in the Foreign Office statement, His Majesty's Government has agreed to withdraw recognition of the Chinese Kuomintang government that fled to Taiwan. In the future, His Majesty's Government's consul in Tamsui, Taiwan, will maintain de facto contact with the local authorities in Taiwan. This does not represent de facto diplomatic relations with the authorities there. The British consul's affairs will be limited to taking care of British interests there."

	On one hand establishing diplomatic relations with the New China, on the other hand still colluding with the remnant bandits

This attitude of the British government raises doubts about whether it can comply with the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's requirement for foreign governments to "sever relations with the Kuomintang reactionaries." This issue, like other promises of the British government, needs to be examined with facts. The British Information Service's dispatch concluded by saying: "His Majesty's Government's recognition of the Beijing government does not mean they will relax in the slightest their determination to continue fighting the Malayan Communist terrorists and generally working to prevent the tide of communism from crossing the borders of China. In this regard, the Colombo Conference can make an important contribution." This statement is extremely beneficial for the Chinese people, the people of all nations enslaved by British imperialism and its agents, and for the British people. People can thereby understand the political faces of the governments of the countries participating in the Colombo Conference.

	If oppressed nations want to gain freedom, they can only rely on their own struggles

People can draw a useful lesson, that the people oppressed by imperialism should never harbor illusions about imperialism. If oppressed nations want to gain freedom and force imperialists to "recognize" this freedom, they can only rely on their own struggles, like the struggles carried out by the Chinese people. And the imperialists always call the struggles of oppressed nations for independence and freedom "communism."

    英新闻处公布英与我建立外交关系新闻
    暴露英帝敌视中国人民
    人们可以由此得出有益的教训，被帝国主义压迫的人民，决不应对帝国主义抱有幻想。               
    【新华社北京九日电】在中华人民共和国宣告成立的三个月零六天以后，英国政府跟在十三个国家政府之后宣布与中华人民共和国中央人民政府“在平等、互利和互相尊重领土和主权的基础上建立外交关系”。只要外交关系确实是建立在“平等、互利和互相尊重领土和主权的基础上”，当然是中国人民所愿意的。中国人民是一个懂得“礼尚往来”和“听其言而观其行”的民族，因此可以相信，中国中央人民政府将按英国政府对于中国所采的实际行动而不是它的宣言来决定自己对待英国政府的相应的步骤。英国政府历史上在中国行动的纪录如何，中国人民记忆犹新。代表英国政府的英国新闻处对于英国政府与中华人民共和国建立外交关系一事所作的解释，是特别唤起中国人民这种记忆的。
            敌意地把新中国和西班牙法西斯政府相提并论
    英国新闻处伦敦六日电一开始就将中华人民共和国中央人民政府粗鲁地歪曲为“中国共产党政府”，并且说：“承认一个政府绝非表示赞同这个政府的政策，反过来也是一样。这次的情形就是如此，和对于东欧各国政府或佛朗哥的政府的情形相似。”在这里，英国帝国主义分子毫不隐藏他们对于坚决反对帝国主义的中华人民共和国和一切人民民主国家的本能的敌意。他们敌意地把中华人民共和国和东欧人民民主国家与西班牙的法西斯政府相提并论，但是举世周知，佛朗哥的最好的亲戚和肆无忌惮的支持者正是英国政府。英国新闻处继续说：“如外交部声明所宣布的，陛下政府同意撤销了对逃到台湾的中国国民党政府的承认。今后，陛下政府驻台湾淡水领事将与台湾地方当局保持事实上的联系。这并不表示对那里当局的事实上的外交关系。英国领事的事务将限于照顾英国在那里的利益。”
            一面和新中国建立外交关系，一面仍和残余匪帮勾搭
    英国政府的这个态度，引起人们怀疑它能否符合于中国人民政协共同纲领对于外国政府所要求的“与国民党反动派断绝关系”。这个问题，和英国政府的其他诺言一样，是需要用事实来审查的。英国新闻处的电讯在结束时说：“陛下政府承认北京政府并不表示他们丝毫放松他们继续对马来亚共产党恐怖作战以及一般地致力于阻止共产主义潮流越出中国国境的决心。在这方面，科伦坡会议将可有重要贡献”。这个声明，对于中国人民、被英国帝国主义及其代理人所奴役的各民族人民，以及对于英国人民，都是极其有益的。人们可以由此认识参加科伦坡会议各国政府的政治面目。
            被压迫民族若要取得自由，就只有依靠自己的奋斗
    人们可以得出有益的教训，即被帝国主义压迫的人民决不应对帝国主义抱有幻想。被压迫民族若要取得自由并迫使帝国主义者“承认”这种自由，就只有依靠自己的奋斗，如像中国人民所进行的奋斗一样。而帝国主义者总是把被压迫民族争取独立自由的奋斗叫作“共产主义”的。
