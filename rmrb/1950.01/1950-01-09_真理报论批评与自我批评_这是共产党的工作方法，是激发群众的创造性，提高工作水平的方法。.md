Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: TASS, Moscow reports: "Pravda" recently published an editorial discussing criticism and self-criticism as the working method of the Communist Party, a method to stimulate mass creativity and improve work standards. "Pravda" writes: From its initial establishment, the Communist Party has educated and cultivated its cadres with a spirit of loyal service to the working class and the cause of socialism, and with a spirit of high demands and absolute intolerance towards shortcomings and errors. Criticism and self-criticism are the unique laws and driving forces of Soviet society, discovered by the brilliant Comrade Stalin. "Pravda" points out: In our Party and in our country, all conditions have been created to ensure the broad unfolding of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom and from bottom to top, the unfolding of courageous and principled criticism, and criticism that need not be afraid of anyone. The masses within the Party test and appraise their leaders by listening to their reports at activist conferences, representative conferences, and representative congresses, criticizing the shortcomings of these leaders, and finally deciding whether to re-elect these leaders into leading organs. Non-Party masses, on the other hand, test and appraise their economic, trade union, and other leaders by actively participating in the mass meetings of non-Party people who participate in public affairs, and in various mass rallies (where they listen to the reports of outstanding workers, criticize their shortcomings, and point out ways to correct them). All of this makes it possible to promptly issue warnings and correct errors and shortcomings in work, stimulate the creative initiative of millions of communist builders, gradually improve the level of all our work, and accelerate our pace towards communism.

    真理报论批评与自我批评
    ——这是共产党的工作方法，是激发群众的创造性，提高工作水平的方法。
    【新华社北京八日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷发表社论，论述批评与自我批评是共产党的工作方法，是激发群众的创造性，提高工作水平的方法。真理报写道：共产党从它成立的初期开始，就本着为工人阶级，为社会主义的事业忠诚服务的精神，本着要求很高和对缺点与错误绝不妥协的精神，来教育与培养干部的。批评与自我批评是苏维埃社会的特殊规律和动力，这是天才的斯大林同志所发现的。真理报指出：在我们的党内，在我们的国家里，已创造了一切条件，保证进行从上至下而又从下至上地广泛展开布尔什维克的批评与自我批评，展开勇敢的有原则的批评，并展开对谁也无须顾忌的批评。党内群众通过下列方式来考验和鉴定他们的领导人，他们在积极分子大会上，在代表会议与代表大会上，听取领导人的报告，批评这些领导人的缺点，最后才决定是否把这些领导人再选入领导机关。而非党群众，则在积极参加公众事务的党外人民的大会上，在各种各样的群众大会上（他们在这些集会上听取卓越的工人的报告，批评其缺点，并指出改正缺点的方法），考验并鉴定他们的经济方面、工会方面及其他方面的领导人。这一切使有可能及时提出警告并及时改正工作上的错误和缺点，激发千百万共产主义建设者的创造性的倡议，逐步提高我们全部工作的水平，并加速我们向共产主义迈进的步调。
