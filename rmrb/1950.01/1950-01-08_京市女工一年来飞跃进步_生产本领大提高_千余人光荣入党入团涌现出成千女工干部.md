A report by Song Ting, Director of the Women Workers' Department of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, at an enlarged meeting of female worker cadres, introduced the progress made by female workers in Beijing in various aspects over the past year. Song Ting said:

Due to long-term feudal oppression and the rule of the enemy, puppets, and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, female workers in Beijing were lagging behind male workers in all aspects. When Beijing was first liberated, many female workers were afraid of others seeing that they were workers. They would only put on their work clothes when they arrived at the factory and immediately take them off after work.

After a year of study, they are making rapid progress. Today's female workers are significantly different from before. They have realized that labor is glorious. They love the factory as if it were their own home. Many female workers in the clothing factory joined the factory's security team to protect the factory, taking night shifts like male workers. In June last year, the cotton stored at the West Railway Station by the factory caught fire. They rushed to the West Station to rescue the cotton, just like the male workers. When twenty-one boxes of matches caught fire at the privately-owned Housheng Match Factory, all the female workers, like the male workers, voluntarily worked overtime to replace the twenty-one boxes of matches that had been burned.

Female workers have also made significant progress in production and conservation. In the production of winter clothing at the clothing factory, the daily output of female workers in Factory No. 2 increased from 4.5 sets to 7.5 sets. The female worker team in the sewing department of Factory No. 1 also defeated the male worker team in the competition. Huang Baozhu, a female worker at the privately-owned Hengdecheng Textile Factory, increased her daily weaving output from 50 feet of cloth to over 100 feet. The female workers at the factory who tie the tassels used to only be able to supply two machines, but now they can supply six machines. To save raw materials and reduce costs, the female workers in the clothing factory also used old cloth or scraps to make clothing linings. The female workers in Branch Factory No. 3 saved more than 5,800 yards of thread after the first phase of winter clothing production, enough to make more than 1,000 sets of cotton military uniforms. In addition, they are also full of enthusiasm for learning technology. For example, Qinghe Woolen Mill did not have female workers operating machines before. After a period of hard work, female workers Li Shuyu and Guo Xiuzhen are now not only able to drive the machines, but also produce 86 jin of thread per day, catching up with the male workers. As their political consciousness gradually increases, more than 4,200 of the city's more than 4,800 female workers have joined the trade union. Among them, 350 have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China, and 721 have joined the New Democratic Youth League. More than 4,000 people have participated in night schools and training classes. 884 people have become cadres above the level of team leader, and 21 have left production to participate in the work of the government and various people's organizations. Among the 371 representatives of the Beijing Women's Congress, 65 are female workers, and 10 female workers have been elected as members of the Executive Committee of the Women's Federation, including three who have been elected as members of the Standing Committee of the Women's Federation. They will lead the broad masses of women in Beijing to participate in the construction of the people's capital and march towards the great road of labor and production!

    京市女工一年来飞跃进步
    生产本领大提高
    千余人光荣入党入团涌现出成千女工干部
    【北京讯】市总工会筹委会女工部部长宋汀在女工干部扩大会上的报告中，曾对北京市女工一年来在各方面的进步作了介绍。宋汀说：
    北京市的女工，由于长期的封建压迫和敌伪、蒋匪的统治，使她们在各方面较之男工要落后些。北京刚解放时，许多女工总怕别人看出自己是一个工人，到厂里时，才把工服穿上，下工后，马上把工服脱下来。
    经过一年来的学习，她们正在飞跃的进步着，今天的女工，已经和从前有显著的不同了。她们已认识到劳动是光荣的，她们对工厂像对自己的家一样的爱护，被服厂许多女工为了护厂而参加了工厂纠察队，和男工一样的值夜班，去年六月间该厂存在西车站的棉花被烧起火，她们也和男工一样的跑到西站去抢救棉花。私营厚生火柴厂烧着了二十一箱火柴，全体女工和男工一样的自动加班，补上被火烧掉的二十一箱火柴。
    在生产节约方面，女工也有显著的进步。被服厂在冬装生产中，二厂女工每天产量从四点五套增到七点五套，一厂缝纫部的女工班在竞赛中并战胜了男工班。私营恒德成纺织厂女工黄宝珠从每天织五十尺布增到一百尺以上；该厂打穗的女工，从前每天只能供两台机器使用，现在已经能供六台机器使用了。为节省原料减低成本，被服厂的女工，并利用旧布或碎布凑成衣服里子。三分厂的女工，在第一期冬装生产结束后，共节省了五千八百多码线，能做一千多套棉军服。此外，他们对学习技术也是充满了热情。如清河制呢厂从前没有女工开机车，女工李淑玉和郭秀贞经过一个时期的努力学习，她们现在不但能够开车，而且一天能生产八十六斤线，赶上了男工。由于她们政治觉悟的逐渐提高，全市四千八百多女工中，已有四千二百多人加入了工会，其中并有三百五十人光荣的加入了中国共产党，七百二十一人加入了新民主主义青年团：有四千多人参加了夜校、训练班的学习；有八百八十四人当了小组长以上的干部，更有二十一人脱离了生产参加了政府和各人民团体的工作。北京妇代会的三百七十一名代表中，有六十五名是女工，而且有十个女工当选了妇联的执行委员，其中三人更当选了妇联的常务委员。她们将领导北京市的广大妇女，参加人民首都的建设工作，向劳动生产的大道迈进！
