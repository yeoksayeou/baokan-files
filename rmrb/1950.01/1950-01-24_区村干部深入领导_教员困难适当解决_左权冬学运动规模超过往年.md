    【Our Dispatch】The winter school movement is being enthusiastically carried out in all villages of Zuoquan County, Shanxi. This county has a total of 416 natural villages, and this year 368 winter schools have been opened, nearly one winter school per village, an increase of more than 100 compared to last year. In the whole county, adult men and women aged 26 to 45 primarily study political lessons (including teaching materials on production and politics) and hygiene lessons; young men and women aged 16 to 25 primarily study culture, enrolling in youth literacy classes and also fully participating in political and hygiene lessons. According to statistics from 15 villages including Lizhang and Tongtan, the number of adults enrolled accounts for 94 percent of the number who should be enrolled, and the number of young people enrolled accounts for 98 percent of the number who should be enrolled. The increase in winter schools and the universality of enrollment in the county this year is an unprecedented new phenomenon.
    Since the beginning of the school term, in just over a month, all winter schools have conducted current affairs and political education on the founding of New China and Sino-Soviet friendship. Generally, students have memorized the names of the Vice Chairmen of the Central People's Government and understand the principle that the Soviet Union is our good friend. Villages with primary schools have generally learned to sing the national anthem. In conjunction with situational education, winter schools have also conducted education on winter production, and some villages have launched a winter manure accumulation campaign. Young men and women are even more enthusiastic about cultural learning. According to county-wide statistics, in the past month, each young person has learned an average of 30 to 100 new characters from being illiterate. Some people have also learned abacus calculation.
    The widespread development of winter schools in the county is due to the following reasons:
    1.  Leadership and Systems. District and village cadres pay attention to the leadership of winter schools. District cadres go to the countryside and directly participate in guiding winter schools, treating winter schools as one of their daily tasks. District cadres become the de facto political teachers of the village they visit. Village cadres take the lead in enrolling in schools themselves. For example, all village cadres in Longze, Shili Dian, and Naozigou villages attend winter schools to promote the enrollment of the masses. The winter schools in Tongtan, Shili Dian, and other villages, under the leadership of the Village Propaganda and Liaison Committee, have regular inspection and work deployment systems, holding meetings every ten days to summarize and inspect the teaching of the previous ten days and, in conjunction with village work deployment, plan the teaching content for the next ten days. In addition, all village winter schools in the county have established systems for roll call, make-up lessons, transfers, and tests. 2. Appropriate solutions have been found for the specific difficulties of winter school teachers. Winter school teachers in the county are exempted from winter village duties, which allows everyone to focus on running the winter schools and be actively responsible. In terms of teaching, each district has established teaching stations based on joint defense units to help solve teachers' difficulties in teaching content and pays attention to organizing teachers to conduct research on teaching issues. For example, the 14 winter school teachers of the Saiwang Joint Defense Unit in the First District hold meetings every half month, with the participation of the principal of the central primary school, to study teaching content and exchange experiences. Teachers are not only at ease with teaching and understand the teaching content but are also generally able to prepare fully before class and have a clear purpose for each lesson—to make the masses understand that issue and let everyone discuss it in class, so that the masses make rapid progress in learning. 3. The Communist Youth League members have played an active role. In villages where the Youth League has been established, the League members can overcome various difficulties and take the lead in learning. In villages where the League is being established, young people also actively learn and strive to join the League. Youth League members in Longze voluntarily took out hemp seeds to exchange for lamp oil to provide for everyone to attend classes at night. Some young people voluntarily go up the mountains to chop firewood to solve the problem of burning fuel. Under the leadership of the Youth League, the learning enthusiasm of the youth literacy classes in various villages has been high, becoming the main force in this year's winter school movement.

### 区村干部深入领导  教员困难适当解决  左权冬学运动规模超过往年

    区村干部深入领导
    教员困难适当解决
    左权冬学运动规模超过往年
    【本报讯】山西左权全县各村冬学运动热烈展开。该县共四百一十六个自然村，今年开办冬学三百六十八所，将近每村一所冬学，较去年增加一百多所。全县二十六岁至四十五岁的壮年男女以上政治课（包括生产、政治等教材）和卫生课为主；十六岁至二十五岁的青年男女以文化学习为主，入青年补习班，政治、卫生课也全部参加。据里长、桐滩等十五个村统计，入学之壮年人数占应入学人数百分之九十四，青年人数占应入学人数百分之九十八。今年该县冬学的增加与入学的普遍，是前所未有的新气象。
    开学到现在，短短一个多月的光景，各冬学都进行了有关新中国成立及中苏友好等时事政治教育，一般学员都记住了中央人民政府副主席的名字，懂得苏联是我们的好朋友的道理。有小学的村庄，一般已学会唱国歌。结合形势教育，冬学并进行了冬季生产的教育，有的村已开展了冬季积肥运动。青年男女的文化学习更为起劲，据全县统计，一个月来，平均每个青年由不识字已识到三十个至一百个生字。有的人还学会了珠算。
    该县冬学的能够普遍开展，有以下数点原因：
    一、有领导、有制度。区、村干部注意冬学领导，区干部下乡，都直接参加指导冬学，将冬学当成日常工作之一。区干部到那个村，即成为该村的当然政治教员。村干部自己带头入学，如龙则、十里店、堖子沟等村全体村干部都到冬学学习，推动了广大群众入学。桐滩、十里店等村的冬学，在村宣联会的领导下，有定期的检查和布置工作制度，十天开会一次，总结检查前十天的教学，结合村中工作布置，计划下十天的教学内容。此外全县各村冬学均建立了点名、补课、转学、测验等制度。二、适当地解决了冬学教员的具体困难，该县冬学教员均被免除冬季村中勤务，这样使大家能安心办冬学，并且积极负责。在教学方面，各区以联防为单位，设立传授站，帮助解决教员在教学内容上的困难。并注意组织教员对教学问题进行研究。如一区塞王联防冬学教员十四人，每半月开会一次，中心小学校长也参加，研究教学内容，交流经验。教员既安心于教学，且了解教学内容，一般都能做到课前充分准备，每次课有明确目的——要群众了解那个问题，并让大家当堂讨论，这样，群众学习进步很快。三、青年团员起了积极作用。已建团的村，青年团员能克服各种困难，积极带头学习，正在建团的村，青年也积极学习，争取入团。龙则青年团员自动拿出麻籽换灯油供给大家夜间上课。有的青年自动上山打柴，解决烧火问题。在青年团的带头下，各村青年补习班学习情绪高涨，成为今年冬学运动中的主力。
