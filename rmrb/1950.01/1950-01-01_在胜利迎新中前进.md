    Advancing in Victory and Welcoming the New Year
    Chen Mengjia
    All those who were in Beijing at this time last year must have felt particularly happy and excited about the first New Year after liberation, and must have had many thoughts. A year ago at this time, people were in the besieged city, anxiously waiting and hoping for liberation to come quickly. At that time, a few people inevitably feared the future and had various uneasy emotions. As far as the general intellectuals were concerned, they only achieved this much: that is, they were able to know what to choose and resolutely commit themselves at the important juncture of the great era. That is, when the Japanese invaders launched the "July 7th" incident, everyone left without hesitation, and when the era of the Great Revolution had just stepped into the circle of North China, they also stayed without hesitation. At that time, everyone deeply hated the Kuomintang regime, which had committed numerous evils and was corrupt and reactionary, and placed infinite hopes on the new revolutionary forces that were about to arrive. At that time, the slogan "Welcoming the Light" was popular among young people. Our Tsinghua Garden was liberated before the siege, and in the reunion on New Year's Eve, we also felt the need for self-criticism. What kind of negative or contemptuous attitude did we intellectuals hold towards politics in the past, and what positive contributions did we make to the revolution? May I ask how many of us intellectuals, especially those working in universities, have directly participated in the revolution, taken risks, shed blood and sweat, and made even a tiny bit of contribution? At most, we only managed to "not worry about poverty," which cannot be considered a merit! At that time, we also felt that waiting and welcoming were not enough, and we should "move towards the light." These four words were what I saw on the badge of the People's Liberation Army soldier when I first entered Tsinghua Garden.
    In the past year, the Central People's Government based on the entire people has been proclaimed, and the Liberation War on the Chinese mainland is nearing its end. The broad national liberation that people hoped for at that time will be fully realized, and a solid foundation has been laid for a bright future. What we should be grateful for is the wise and courageous Chinese Communist Party, the hardworking and brave People's Liberation Army, and the worker-peasant masses who supported this great revolutionary war. We intellectuals still haven't contributed the strength we should have; on the contrary, we have received better material treatment, we have done the so-called "mental labor" with ease, and our backwardness is so serious that we often can't even talk about "mental labor."
    Chairman Mao has already called on the entire people in the joyful cheers of welcoming the new year to engage in economic construction and cultural construction, to make this construction boom at least as high as the revolutionary military boom, and as heroic as the clouds. The eyes of the world are following Chairman Mao, and his every move, every word, contains significant, epoch-making, revolutionary, and progressive meaning. His every move is also the every move of the Chinese people; his every word is also the every word of the Chinese people. The most noteworthy event in the world recently is his meeting with Marshal Stalin, uniting half of the world, the beliefs, will, and cause of the two major nations in the Eastern Hemisphere; what a significant meaning this has! As a member of the people, we accept this meaning, and how inspiring this is! But from the perspective of intellectuals, where is our direct contribution to serving the country and the people? What progress have we made in this year? What effect has our labor had? What kind of power is generated in the face of the call for construction?
    We undoubtedly throw ourselves into the vortex of cultural construction, recognizing it as an opportunity to transform ourselves and serve the people; upholding the principle of seeking truth from facts, not seeking shortcuts, not shrinking back, and striving to wash away our past serious mistakes of disregarding the people and disregarding politics, and making a completely new start. This is precisely the moment when we feel the most humble and ashamed. With the weight of the baggage we carried in the past, the tenacity of our accumulated habits, the preferential rights we enjoyed, the depth of our self-esteem, and the insignificance of our service to the people, how much more should we strive to catch up and keep pace with the people of the whole country.
    This is a bit of serious self-reflection that we should retain in the victory of the revolution and the revelry of welcoming the new year.
                                        Evening of December 27, 1949

    在胜利迎新中前进
    陈梦家
    凡是去年此时在北京的人们，对于解放后第一个新年，一定是分外地愉快而兴奋的，也一定有许多的感想。一年前的此时，人们处在围城之中，无不焦急地等待着，希望着快快解放。那时候有少数的人不免恐惧未来，有着种种不安的情绪。就一般知识分子说来，他们只做到了这一点，就是能在大时代的重要关头，知所选择，决然以赴：那就是当“七七”日寇侵略时，大家毫不犹豫的走掉，而当大革命的时代刚刚踏入华北的圈内时，他们也毫不犹豫的留着。那时候大家对于作恶多端，腐败反动的国民党政权已属深痛疾恶，对于将要来到的新的革命势力寄以无穷的热望。那时候青年口中流行着“迎接光明”的口号。我们清华园解放于围城之先，在新年除夕的团聚中，我们也曾感到自我批判的必要。我们知识分子过去对于政治抱着何等消极或轻视的态度，对于革命曾有什么积极的建树？试问我们知识分子，尤其是在大学里工作的知识分子，有多少曾直接参加革命，曾冒过艰险，流过血汗，有一星半点的贡献？至多也不过作到了“不忧贫”而已，这并不能算作功劳！我们那时也已感觉到，等待与迎接是不够的，应该“走向光明”。这四个字是我在最初进入清华园的解放军士的别针上看到的。
    一年以来，以全体人民为基础的中央人民政府已宣告成立，中国大陆上的解放战争已接近尾声。当时人们所希望的广大的全国的解放已将完全实现，光明的未来已建立了巩固的根基，而我们所应感谢的还是贤明英毅的中国共产党，劳苦勇敢的人民解放军与支援这伟大革命战争的工农大众。我们知识分子仍然没有拿出应有的力量；反之，我们所受的是较优的物质待遇，我们所作的是轻而易举的所谓“脑力劳动”，我们的落后性是如此严重，常常连“脑力劳动”也谈不到。
    毛主席已经在胜利迎新的欢声中，号召全体人民从事经济建设和文化建设，要使这建设的热潮至少和革命的军事热潮一样高腾，一样的气概如云。世界的眼光跟随着毛主席，他现在的一举一动，片言只字，都含有重大的、划时代的、革命的、进取的意义。他的一举一动，也就是中国人民的一举一动；他的片言只字，也就是中国人民的片言只字。最近为全世界所注目的事件就是他和斯大林大元帅的会合，联合了世界半壁，东半球两大民族的信仰，意志与事业；这又有何等样重大的意义！我们以人民一分子的资格，接受了这个意义，又是何等可感奋的事！但是从知识分子的立场来说，我们直接报国报民的贡献在那里？在这一年中我们有了什么进步？我们的劳动又有了什么效果？在迎面而来建设的呼声当中发生一种什么力量？
    我们毫无疑义地把自己投进文化建设的漩涡内，认定它是一个改造自己服务人民的机会；抱定实事求是，不取巧，不畏缩，务求洗刷自己过去漠视人民漠视政治的重大错误，焕然一新，从头作人。这正是我们感到最谦卑最抱愧的刹那，以我们过去所背的包袱的沉重，积习的坚牢，所享权利的优沃，自负之深，服役于人民的微渺，更应如何急追直上，求与全国人民步伐一致。
    这是我们在革命的胜利中，迎新的狂欢中，应该保留的一点严肃的自我检讨。
                                        一九四九年十二月二十七日晚
