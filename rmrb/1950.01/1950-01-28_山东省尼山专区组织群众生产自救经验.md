    Shandong Province, Nishan Special District's Experiences in Organizing the Masses for Production and Self-Relief are introduced below:
            In-depth education of the masses to enhance confidence in production and self-relief.
    (1) It is necessary to conduct in-depth education among the masses to enhance their confidence in production and self-relief. First cadres and Party members, then the general public, first small groups then general meetings, organize discussions on "How to overcome the famine?" The first question is whether it is feasible to rely on government relief to overcome the famine? The masses understand that it is impossible and inappropriate to rely entirely on the government. It is easy to get through to the masses on this point. The second question is whether "eating from the wealthy" and "sharing resources equally" are viable? The masses also know that "eating from the wealthy" and "sharing resources equally" can only cause social chaos and deepen the disaster. The third question is whether there are more ways to survive by fleeing or by staying home? This is a key question, and concrete facts are needed to convince the masses. The fourth question is whether there are any solutions for self-relief at home? After dispelling the idea that "fleeing is the only way out," many people can think of ways to save themselves at home. This kind of gradual, in-depth education, where the masses solve their own ideological problems through discussion, is a more specific and effective approach, and it has achieved great results in villages such as Dingjiazhuang.
    The second is recollection and comparison: First, select models of production and self-relief during past and present famines from among the masses (each village has such people) to cultivate them. Through them, organize the masses to recall and compare. For example, during a discussion in Baiyan Miaozhuang, people said: "The years 1926 and 1927 were much harder than now. The common people had nothing to eat, and the Kuomintang still forced donations and taxes. Even selling peanuts or two ounces of tobacco required a stamp. Whoever starved deserved to die. How could we have imagined surviving until now?" Liu Benxiu, a poor peasant in the village, said: "Thinking about that time, now it's like being in paradise. The government distributes relief grain and loans, taking responsibility for the people. Comrades take out their grain coupons to exchange for our bran and vegetable dishes. Fleeing recklessly would be letting down the leadership." Grandpa Yan said, "We were able to survive 1926 and 1927 under the oppression of the Kuomintang and wealthy landlords. Now, with the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the People's Government, are we still afraid of getting through this?" This generally increased the masses' confidence in production and self-relief. After this kind of education, the people of Zhuangmutou Village, who had gone out to beg, tried to avoid the working staff. When they met, they said with shame, "Comrade, we are really sorry to you. We only need to beg a few more times to be able to rely on production for self-relief."
    The best education method is to use examples for typical education: Using successful examples and experiences of models is the easiest way to educate the masses, and they accept it the fastest. For example, Renjiaqiao used this method to break the mindset among cadres and the masses that production couldn't provide self-relief, greatly increasing their confidence in production and self-relief. In Xiangcheng District of Zou County, returned refugees told the masses about the hardships of reckless fleeing, which stopped blind fleeing and brought back more than two hundred households.
            Cadres and Party members take the lead, extend it to the whole village, and then generalize it to all villages.
    (2) Starting with cadres and Party members, then organizing the entire village for production and self-relief, and promoting the experience of one typical village to the surrounding areas has been the common experience of villages that have done a good job in production and self-relief recently. For example, in Renjiaqiao, Jiang Tingju and Zheng Yuchun took the lead, then the whole village was organized. In Huchang and Dawang in Jibei, village cadres and activists first took the lead in self-relief, and then the whole village was organized. At the same time, in Ziyang, due to the promotion of Renjiaqiao's experience, five villages (Renjiaqiao, Dingjiazhuang, Jiejiazhuang, Weijiajing, and Mengjiazhuang) have achieved production and self-relief, and over a hundred villages have embarked on the road to production and self-relief.
            Leadership attaches importance, various departments combine efforts, the role of cooperatives is brought into play, and the masses' sideline production is developed.
    (3) With the leadership's attention, the combination of various departments, and the establishment and full utilization of the role of cooperatives, the masses' sideline production can be well developed. Since the last meeting of the CPC Prefectural Committee, the prefectural, county, and district levels have all had certain cadres in charge of sideline production. This is reflected in the fact that on the one hand, they began to plan what sideline production there was in the local area, how to organize and lead it, and on the other hand, they strengthened the establishment of cooperatives and their leadership. Therefore, cooperative activities also became more active. Currently, the prefectural commissioner's office, Teng County, Zou County, and Qufu Promotion Cooperatives have all sent people to Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Xuzhou, Zaozhuang, Jinan, Boshan, and other places to promote the sale of the masses' mountain fruits, mats, medicinal materials, burlap sacks, and stones. Therefore, the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas has begun, and the masses' products have partially found sales channels. Sideline production in Qufu, Jibei, and Pingyi has become more active than before. At the same time, under the unified leadership of the higher levels, the activities of various departments, such as transporting grain, grinding rice, transporting firewood, construction and repair, making shoes, and selling oil and salt, are more consciously combined with disaster relief, while reducing the exploitation by merchants in the middle. For example, this time, Yanzhou stores milled 400,000 catties of rice and distributed it to disaster victims, which earned over 108,000 catties of bran and over 12,000 catties of millet. The organs will use 100,000 pairs of shoes next year and organize disaster victims to make them, which will provide a profit equivalent to 500,000 catties of grain. In other districts, there are also many who lend their own grain and vegetable money to the masses as capital for production, and many district cadres voluntarily eat vegetables and bran with poor households. In short, as long as our Party, government, army, and people are mobilized and work together, we can overcome the disaster.
            Correctly implement policies, launch social mutual assistance, and mobilize the business community to operate freely.
    (4) It is necessary to correctly implement the policies of social mutual assistance and mutual benefit for labor and capital. In terms of social mutual assistance, in addition to the main task of propaganda and conscientious inspection and implementation of the policy of protecting middle peasants, the better methods currently used in various places are: (1) Universal education and mobilization, individual self-seeking and borrowing. (2) Intermediaries provide matchmaking and draw up loan agreements. (3) Guarantors lend out money once (wealthy households are afraid of lending it out randomly and not being able to cope) and then re-lend and repay in installments. (4) Advocate short-term loans (coming in one hand and going out the other, half a month or a month) and conditional long-term loans.
    Regarding the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital, today the main task is to mobilize the business community to operate freely and boldly develop undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy, which is an important link in the current development of the masses' sideline production and the organization of urban and rural material exchanges. It is necessary to conscientiously inspect and implement the policy of protecting industry and commerce, and use various forms to mobilize and organize merchants to engage in undertakings that are beneficial to the development of the national economy and promote production, which will play a significant role in the masses' production and disaster relief. For example, Hongyi Company in Teng County organizes the masses to roll cigarettes, extract oil, and weave burlap sacks. The egg-processing plant and burlap sack factory in Yanzhou, and the glass factory and cargo terminal being planned in Zou County and Teng County, can also solve many problems. In Huchang in Jibei and Gonglizhuang in Pingyi, the masses' sideline production has been well developed due to the good absorption of investment from middle and rich peasants.
            Organizing the masses' sideline production requires solving five problems, including capital.
    (5) Organizing the masses' sideline production requires solving the following problems well:
    1. Capital: The main source is the masses' shareholding. It is best to mobilize wealthy people to invest heavily, or convert trees, surplus furniture, etc., into capital for production, carry out social mutual assistance, and provide necessary loans to individual households in the most difficult situations. According to general understanding, a considerable amount of production capital can be planned from the above aspects even in villages severely affected by disasters.
    2. Organization: It should be a free combination, allowing individual production. The general experience of organization is that the small group form is the best. Individual production has weak capital, insufficient tools and technology, and cannot combine labor, capital, and resources. Past organizational forms, such as large cooperatives and large-scale trading, were difficult to manage and often suffered from undemocratic practices and corruption. Therefore, a small production group combining the labor, capital, tools, and technology of seven or eight or a dozen households is generally the most suitable.
    3. The production problem of poor, widowed, orphaned, and childless individuals: This is the most difficult problem in production and disaster relief. The solutions adopted in various places include: organizing handicraft production such as weaving burlap sacks, weaving mats, and spinning thread. If they don't know how, they are taught, and good ways are sought to sell their products. Some offer their own houses for production use, exchange labor to watch children, and mobilize them to do odd jobs for wealthy households.
    4. Price issues: General handicraft production is less affected by prices, while small hawkers carrying goods on their shoulders are more affected. The experience in various places is: Buy goods after selling goods, bring goods back after selling goods. Cooperatives and leaders promptly and continuously inform the masses of production directions and local market conditions.
    5. District and village levels should strengthen leadership, continuously check the problems of each group, especially promote accounting, profit sharing, and solving fairness issues in various combinations. Otherwise, the organization will also collapse.

    山东省尼山专区组织群众生产自救经验
    山东省尼山专区动员与组织群众生产自救的经验，介绍如下：
            深入群众进行教育，提高生产自救信心。
    （一）必须在群众中深入教育，提高生产自救信心。先干部党员后一般群众，先小组后大会，组织讨论“如何渡过灾荒？”第一个问题是依靠政府救济渡荒行不行？这个问题群众都了解全部依靠政府是不可能的，也是不应该的。群众思想很易打通。第二个问题是“吃大户”“匀着吃”能行不能行？这点群众也知道，“吃大户”，“匀着吃”是只能造成社会混乱，加深了灾害。第三个问题，逃荒出去办法多，还是在家办法多？这是个主要问题，必须有具体事实才能说服群众。第四个问题是在家究竟有没有办法？很多群众在打消了“只有逃荒是出路”的思想后，就可想出在家自救的办法，这种逐步打通思想由群众自己的讨论解决群众自己的思想，是一种较深入具体的教育方式，这种方式在丁家庄等村都收到很大效果。
    其次是回忆对比：先在群众中选择过去和现在渡荒中生产自救的模范（这样的人各村都有）来培养他们，通过他们组织群众的回忆对比，如白彦苗庄群众讨论时纷纷说：民国十五年、十六年比现在苦多了，老百姓没的吃，国民党还得逼捐税，卖点花生卖二斤烟都要贴印花，谁饿死谁该死，想想那时节那想活到现在？该庄贫民刘本修说：想想那时，现在像在天堂一样，政府发救济粮发贷款对人民负责，同志们拿出粮票来换咱的糠菜吃，胡乱逃荒就对不起上级了；阎大爷说：“过去国民党大地主压迫咱就能熬过民国十五年、十六年，现在有共产党、人民政府领导和帮助咱，还怕熬不过去吗？”因此就普遍提高了群众生产自救的信心。庄木头村的群众，经过这种教育后出去要饭的都背着工作人员走，见了面就惭愧的说：“同志，俺真对不起您，俺再要几回就能生产自救了”。
    教育方法最好是以实例进行典型教育：多用模范的成功的实例和经验，最容易教育群众，群众接受也最快，如任家桥就用这种方法打破了干部和群众生产不能自救的思想，大大的提高了生产自救的信心；邹县香城区，通过逃荒回来的灾民向群众讲述胡乱逃荒的困苦，达到了停止盲目逃荒，并争取回来了二百多户。
            干部党员先作起，推广到全村，再普遍到各村。
    （二）从干部党员作起，到组织全村生产自救，以一村的典型向四外推广，这是近来作好生产自救村庄的共同经验，如任家桥先由蒋廷举、郑玉春组然后到全村组织起来，济北的胡厂和大王都先由村干部和积极分子打头自救，再到组织全村；同时在滋阳由于宣传推广任家桥的经验，已有五个庄（任家桥、丁家庄、介家庄、魏家井、孟家庄）达到生产自救，百多村庄都走上了生产自救的道路。
            领导重视，各部门结合，发挥合作社作用，发展群众副业生产。
    （三）领导上重视，各部门结合，建立健全并充分发挥合作社的作用，群众副业生产就可很好发展起来。自中共地委上次会后，地、县、区都有一定的干部领导副业生产，表现在一面开始计划本地有些什么副业生业，怎样组织和领导，一面就是建立合作社和对其领导上加强，因此合作社活动也积极了，现专署、滕县、邹县、曲阜推进社，都纷纷派人到上海、南京、杭州、徐州、枣庄、济南、博山等地去推销群众的山果、席子、药材、麻袋、石子。因此，使城乡物资开始交流，群众的产品已得到部分销路。在曲阜、济北、平邑的副业生产就较前活跃起来。同时在上级的统一领导下，各部门的活动如在运粮，磨米，运柴，建修，作鞋，卖买油盐各方面也较有意识的结合了救灾，而又减少了商人中间的剥削。如这次兗州商店碾米四十万斤，分配给灾民即可赚糠十万八千多斤，一万二千多斤小米；机关明年要用十万双鞋子，组织灾民来做，即有五十万斤粮食的利润；其他在分区中也有不少将自己粮食菜金借给群众当资本去作生产的，也有不少区干部自动找贫苦户吃菜吃糠，这样一个干部一天一斤十五两粮食即可养活四口之家。总之，只要我党政军民动员起来，共同努力，是很可以战胜灾荒的。
            正确执行政策，发动社会互济，动员工商界放手经营。
    （四）必须正确的执行社会互济与劳资两利政策。在社会互济上，除主要的宣传与认真检查贯彻执行保护中农政策外，现在各地较好的进行方式有：（１）普遍的教育动员，个别的自找自借。（２）托保从中说合，订立借据。（３）保人一次借出（富裕户害怕乱借应付不了）再分借分还。（４）提倡短时借贷（这手来、那手去、半月一月）及有条件的长期借贷。
    在劳资两利政策上，今天主要是动员工商界放手经营，大胆发展与国民经济有利的事业，这是目前发展群众副业生产，组织城乡物资交流的重要一环。要认真检查贯彻执行保护工商业政策，用各种形式动员组织商人，从事发展国民经济有利的事业，繁荣生产，这样就对群众的生产救灾起到不少作用，如滕县鸿义公司，组织群众卷烟，打油，织麻袋。在兗州的打蛋厂，麻袋厂，与邹县滕县正在计划开办的玻璃厂与货栈等也都能解决不少问题。在济北胡厂，平邑巩利庄也由于很好吸收了中农富农的投资，很好的发展了群众的副业生产。
            组织群众副业生产，要解决资本等五项问题。
    （五）组织群众副业生产要很好解决下列几个问题：
    一、资本：主要的由群众集股，最好能动员富有者大量入股，或以树木、多余的家具等折变，集资生产，进行社会互济，个别最困难户予以必要的贷款，据一般了解即在灾重村也可以从以上几方面筹划相当数目的生产资本的。
    二、组织：应当是自由结合，允许单独个人生产，一般组织的经验是以小组形式为最好，单独个人生产资本微弱，工具技术不足，不能使劳资、有无结合起来。过去的组织形式，如大合作社、大股买卖，不易管理，常发生不民主与贪污等毛病，所以一般以七八户、十几户的劳力、资本、工具、技术相结合的小生产组为最适宜。
    三、贫苦的鳏寡孤独的生产问题：这是生产救灾中最困难的问题，各地解决的办法有：组织织麻袋，编席，纺线等手工业生产，不会的即设法教，并很好的设法销售其产品，也有的是把自己房子供生产用，给人变工看孩子，动员他们给富裕户作零活。
    四、物价问题：一般手工业生产，受物价影响较小，肩挑小贩受影响较大，各地经验是：卖货后就进货，卖货后带回头货，合作社和领导上及时地不断告诉群众生产方向和各地行情。
    五、区村要加强领导，不断的检查各组问题，尤其推动算帐、分红、解决各种结合中的公平问题，否则，组织起来一样会垮台的。
