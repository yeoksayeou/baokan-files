    【Beijing News】People from all walks of life and leaders of various organizations in the capital firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's note to the United Nations, demanding that the United Nations expel the so-called "representatives" of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang and appoint a delegation headed by Zhang Wentian, appointed by our Central People's Government, to attend the United Nations and its Security Council. Xiao Ming, director of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: This note is a just proposition, which our working class and the people of the whole country firmly support. We demand that the United Nations immediately throw the Kuomintang reactionary guy Jiang Tingfu into the cesspool and let the representatives of the Chinese people themselves attend the United Nations. We will never stop until this goal is achieved. At the same time, we would like to thank our great ally, the Soviet Union, and the various New Democratic countries for their strong support of Foreign Minister Zhou's statement at the United Nations meetings. They do not participate in meetings attended by representatives of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang and do not recognize resolutions passed with the participation of representatives of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang. This proves that only the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries are the true friends of the Chinese people, and that the New Democratic New China is not isolated internationally. Gao Tongqing, Wang Lianbao, Zhou Tingbi and other employees of the China People's Printing Factory said: The representatives of the Kuomintang reactionaries shamelessly attend the Security Council. May I ask, whom does he represent among the 475 million people? Wang Xiuying, a worker at the Beijing Clothing Factory, said: American imperialism and its lackeys disregard the will of the Chinese people and stubbornly cling to a Jiang Tingfu who cannot represent anyone. This is imperialism's attempt to interfere in the rights and interests of the Chinese people and oppose world peace. In addition to firmly supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's note, workers from various factories expressed their gratitude for the just actions of the representatives of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in the United Nations. Zhu Changjiang, a worker at the Beijing Electric Power Bureau, said: The American imperialists' plot to use the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant bandit gang to oppose the Chinese people has been exposed by our most loyal friends, the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. We thank them for this just support. Liu Linzhi, a worker at the tram company, said: This is a clear contrast. The world is divided into two camps: a peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and an aggression camp headed by American imperialism. We Chinese people clearly see who our friends are and who our enemies are. Chai Zemin, director of the preparatory committee of the Beijing Municipal Farmers' Association, said: Foreign Minister Zhou's note to the United Nations represents the will of the entire Chinese people. The Chinese people have the right to send their own representatives to attend United Nations meetings. We farmers unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou's just demands to the United Nations.
    Professor Qian Duansheng, vice chairman of the preparatory committee of the Beijing Municipal Education Workers' Union, said: Our Central People's Government recently appointed Zhang Wentian as the chief representative of the delegation to the United Nations to participate in the work of the United Nations. Our Chinese people warmly support this appointment. The basic spirit of the establishment of the United Nations is to maintain world peace, not to enslave the people, let alone to make warmongers tools of coercion. The American imperialist group is desperately dragging the "representative" Jiang Tingfu of the remnant bandit gang, intending to resist the representative of the People's Republic of China. This is not only cunning and rogue, but also fundamentally violates the basic spirit of the United Nations Charter. Undoubtedly, it will be opposed by peace-loving people all over the world and will suffer a shameful defeat.
    Gu Qizong, chairman of the Beijing Municipal Student Federation, said: After the Soviet Union recognized the People's Republic of China, it took active, powerful, and just actions in the United Nations to support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. This not only shows that the Soviet Union is a true supporter of international justice, but also demonstrates the Soviet Union's lofty friendship with the Chinese people.
    Fu Huating, chairman of the preparatory committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: The business community in Beijing firmly supports Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and demands that the United Nations General Assembly take legal action in accordance with Foreign Minister Zhou's statement as soon as possible.

    周外长致联合国照会
    京各界坚决拥护
    感谢苏联及新民主国家对我支持
    【北京讯】首都各界人民和各团体负责人坚决拥护周外长致联合国的照会，要求联合国开除国民党残余匪帮的所谓“代表”，而由我中央人民政府任命以张闻天为首的代表团出席联合国及其安全理事会。市总工会筹委会主任萧明说：这个照会是正义的主张，我全国工人阶级和全国人民坚决拥护，我们要求联合国立刻把国民党反动家伙蒋廷黻扔到屎坑里去，由中国人民自己的代表来出席联合国，不达到这个目的我们绝不休止。同时我们要感谢伟大的友邦苏联和各新民主主义国家，他们在联合国会议上有力地支持了周外长的声明，他们不参加有国民党残余匪帮代表参加的会议，不承认有国民党残余匪帮代表参加而通过的决议，这证明只有苏联和新民主主义国家才是中国人民的真正朋友，而新民主主义的新中国在国际上并不是孤立的。中国人民印刷厂职工高同庆、王连保、周廷弼等说：国民党反动派的代表恬不知耻地出席安理会，请问四万万七千五百万人民中他代表了谁？北京被服厂工人王秀英说：美帝国主义和他的喽罗们不考虑中国人民的意志，死拖硬赖地拉住了一个不能代表任何人的蒋廷黻，这就是帝国主义想干涉中国人民的权益，反对世界和平。各工厂工人除了坚决拥护周外长的照会外，并对苏联和人民民主国家代表在联合国的正义行动表示感激，北京电业局工人朱长江说：美帝国主义者想借国民党反动残余匪帮的代表来反对中国人民的阴谋，已经被我们最忠实的朋友苏联和其他各人民民主国家给揭穿了，我们感谢这一正义的支持。电车公司工人刘麟之说：这是一个明显的对比，世界分两个阵营，一个是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，一个是以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营，我们中国人民很清楚的看出谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人。京市农会筹委会主任柴泽民说：周外长致联合国的照会，是代表全中国人民自己的意志，中国人民有权利派遣自己的代表出席联合国会议，我们农民一致地支持周外长向联合国的正义要求。
    北京市教育工作者工会筹备会副主席钱端升教授说：我中央人民政府最近任命张闻天为出席联合国代表团首席代表并参加联合国工作，我们中国人民对这项任命是热烈拥护的，联合国设置的基本精神是维护世界和平而不是奴役人民，更不是使好战分子作为挟持的工具。美帝集团穷极无聊死拖着残余匪帮的“代表”蒋廷黻，意图抵制中华人民共和国的代表，不但狡恶无赖而且根本违反了联合国宪章的基本精神，无疑地它将受到全世界爱好和平人民的反对而遭到可耻的失败。
    京市学联主席古奇踪说：苏联在承认了中华人民共和国之后，在联合国中又以积极地强有力地正义行动，支持周外长的声明，这不但说明了苏联是真正的国际道义的支持者，同时也表现了苏联对中国人民崇高的友谊。
    工商业联合会筹委会主任委员傅华亭说：我们北京市的工商界坚决拥护周外长的声明，并要求联合国大会，迅速按照周外长的声明采取合法行动。
