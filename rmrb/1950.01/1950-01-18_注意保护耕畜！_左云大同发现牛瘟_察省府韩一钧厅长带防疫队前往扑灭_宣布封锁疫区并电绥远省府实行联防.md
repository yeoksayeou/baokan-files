    Pay Attention to Protecting Livestock!
    Cattle Plague Discovered in Zuoyun, Datong
    Director Han Yijun of the Department of the Chahar Provincial Government Leads Epidemic Prevention Team to Eradicate It
    Declares Blockade of the Epidemic Area and Cables the Suiyuan Provincial Government for Joint Prevention
    [Our Newspaper] Cattle plague has been discovered in Zuoyun County, Chahar Province. Its symptoms: sick cattle lose their appetite, have foul-smelling, thick nasal discharge, foul-smelling bloody diarrhea, millet-sized bleeding points on the anal mucosa, bleeding spots on the conjunctiva, tearing, chills and shivering, obvious bleeding points on the upper and lower jaws of the mouth, bran-like lesions on the surface and tip of the tongue, and bran-sized lesions on the gums. The heart is in a state of extreme weakness, breathing is difficult, the pulse is 78 beats per minute, and the body temperature is 40.2 degrees Celsius. As of the 6th of this month, in Caojia Village in the first district of Zuoyun, and the two villages of Heshangzui in the fourth district, twelve heads of cattle have died and five heads of cattle are sick. This cattle plague was transmitted from Longshengzhuang in eastern Suiyuan. Because the epidemic area is near the Datong Kouquan and Zuoyun Heshangzui mining areas, and because of the constant traffic of cattle carts, the spread is rapid and has spread to the twelfth and thirteenth districts of Datong. After receiving a telephone report from the Yanbei Special Commissioner's Office, the Chahar Provincial People's Government sent an epidemic prevention team to diagnose the condition and guide the blockade, isolation, and disinfection work. On the 7th, Director Han Yijun led an epidemic prevention team of 28 people, carrying 200,000 cc of serum and a large number of medicines and equipment to the epidemic area to carry out eradication. It also telegraphed the Central Government for assistance and telegraphed the Suiyuan Provincial Government for joint prevention. At present, the epidemic area has been strictly blockaded. All localities should accept the epidemic prevention experience of last year and properly block traffic between the epidemic area and the adjacent areas to prevent the spread.
    [Another Dispatch] The Charnan Special Commissioner's Office telegraphed the Chahar Provincial People's Government on the 7th, briefly stating: Livestock disease occurred in Taipingbao, Zhuolu, killing one donkey, two horses, and five mules. It is reported that it may be anthrax, and personnel are being sent to check the condition.

    注意保护耕畜！
    左云大同发现牛瘟
    察省府韩一钧厅长带防疫队前往扑灭
    宣布封锁疫区并电绥远省府实行联防
    【本报讯】察哈尔左云县发现牛瘟。其症状：病牛食欲废绝，流恶臭浓鼻汁，粪便恶臭带血下痢，肛门粘膜有粟粒大出充血点，眼结膜有出血斑点，流泪，恶寒战栗，口腔上下颚有显明出血点，舌上面及舌尖部有麩皮样烂斑，齿龈部亦有麩皮大小的烂斑，心脏呈极度衰弱状态，呼吸困难，脉搏每分钟七十八次，体温四○·二度。截至本月六日为止，只左云一区曹家村，四区和尚咀两村已发生病死耕牛十二头及病牛五头。此次牛瘟系由绥东隆盛庄一带传来，因疫区在大同口泉及左云和尚咀等矿区附近，由于牛车往来不绝，蔓延较快，已蔓延至大同十二及十三两个区。察省人民政府于接得雁北专署电话报告后，除派出一个防疫组前往诊断病情，指导封锁隔离与消毒工作外，复于七日由韩一钧厅长率领防疫队二十八人，携带血清二十万西西及大批药械赶往疫区进行扑灭。并电请中央派队协助。另电绥远省府予以联防。目前，疫区已严格封锁，各地应接受去年防疫经验，恰当遮断疫区与接疫区的交通往来，以免蔓延扩大。
    【又讯】察南专署七日致察省人民政府电话略称：涿鹿太平堡发生畜病，已死驴一头，马两匹及骡五头。据报可能是炭疽，病情正派员检查中。
