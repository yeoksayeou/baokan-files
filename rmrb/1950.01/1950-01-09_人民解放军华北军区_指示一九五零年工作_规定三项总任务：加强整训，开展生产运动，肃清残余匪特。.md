[Report from this newspaper] The North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued instructions on December 20, 1949, regarding its work for 1950. The full text is as follows:

Since the complete liberation of North China more than half a year ago, our army has carried out reorganization, training, and bandit suppression work, and has achieved certain results. The main manifestations are: the troops are becoming increasingly consolidated, and the enthusiasm for learning is high; military, political, and logistical work and systems have begun to get on track, consolidating urban security, protecting the safety of transportation, and causing the local bandits either to be annihilated or severely hit. However, because the war environment has changed to a peaceful environment, the content, methods, approaches, and systems of work, and the organizational forms adapted to them, are still unfamiliar to us, so they must be improved step by step. Based on the existing foundation and new circumstances, the general tasks of the North China Military Region for 1950 are specifically defined as follows: First, further strengthen training; second, launch a production movement; and third, continue to eliminate remaining bandits and special agents.

    Four Central Tasks

In order to achieve these three major tasks, we should specifically carry out the following four central tasks:

I. Further strengthen regular military, political, and cultural education.

The education policy is still systematic, step-by-step regular education. Focusing on the long term, construction should be carried out step by step. On the basis of the existing foundation, planning should be strengthened, and based on the principle of fewer but better, we should strive for truly effective results. In terms of time allocation, the ratio of military, political, and cultural education in companies should still be 5:2:3. For cadres studying above the regimental level, there should be different focuses depending on the cadre.

1. In military education. It is required that the subjects learned in the first phase be implemented in daily life, so as to cultivate good military posture and strict military living habits, and initially achieve order and discipline in all work and life. All levels of cadres should be able to perform their duties. Then conduct technical education (grenade throwing, shooting, bayonet fighting, field work), requiring understanding of the performance of general weapons, cultivating the habit of cherishing weapons, understanding simple theories, and skillfully mastering the use of weapons. Conduct individual combat education to lay the foundation for combat education. For communications, reconnaissance, light and heavy machine gun, mortar, and 60mm gun units, in addition to reviewing the subjects of the first phase and conducting individual combat education according to the infantry program, technical education time should be used for technical education in their own business. Cavalry, artillery, and engineering education plans will be formulated separately. Military cadres below the division level are required to be able to organize and lead soldiers to study, so as to be able to speak, do, and teach, and to strengthen internal affairs education to improve education management capabilities.机关干部 will learn basic military knowledge and study business.

2. In political education, the troops should continue to strengthen patriotism and internationalism education on the basis of always being a fighting team, so as to improve the level of the Party's policies among all personnel and cultivate good qualities of loving the country, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and cherishing public property. In addition, we should continue to strengthen the work of giving reports to enrich the political life of the troops. Cadres at the company and battalion level, in addition to participating in company political classes, should also improve their ideological and political level by strengthening teaching preparation.机关干部 groups A and B will generally complete the Concise History of Social Development before the end of February next year. From February to the end of October, they will study political economy (group A will use Leontiev's book, and group B will use Xue Muqiao's book). From November to the end of December, they will study the Communist Manifesto, and spend a certain amount of time studying current affairs policies. Group C will stop theoretical study and focus on learning culture, and also conduct current affairs policy study.

3. In cultural education, the troops should focus on eliminating illiteracy. Within one year, they should generally be able to recognize about 700 characters, so as to achieve four abilities (be able to write, read, speak, and use), and understand simple books and newspapers. Soldiers and company cadres with higher cultural levels, in addition to continuing to improve their reading and writing skills, should vigorously organize and help companies eliminate illiteracy. A system of one hygiene lesson per week (occupying cultural class time) should be established in the troops, combined with public health work (laundry, hair cutting, exterminating insects, etc.), to improve the health of the troops. Generally establish spare-time schools for机关, and all cadres with low cultural levels should focus on cultural supplementary study. Those who have completed intermediate Chinese and arithmetic should add courses such as history, geography, physics, and chemistry, depending on the nature of the troops. The purpose is to enable our cadres to acquire basic cultural knowledge within two or three years, improve their self-study ability, and facilitate the mastery of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, as well as modern military science and technology.

4. Business learning is generally carried out in conjunction with work, and specialized technical cadres use the cultural supplementary study time of other cadres to conduct technical study and research.

5. Within one year, we must improve the ability of existing cadres by strengthening on-the-job cadre study, doing a good job in education preparation, regularly convening labor and study representative meetings, and supplementing them with cadre rotation training.

6. Implement a semi-annual study performance appraisal system.

7. In order to enliven the learning atmosphere, increase education effectiveness, liven up life, and strengthen the body, sports, cultural, and entertainment activities combined with military, political, and cultural education should be carried out. In the spring or autumn of 1950, the military region will hold a sports meeting to review the work of military, political, and education, as well as sports and entertainment. Literary and artistic work should concentrate creative talents as necessary to vigorously solve the creation of scripts and songs. Professional art troupes should strengthen the guidance and performance work of the troops.

8. Equip and train youth work cadres, and universally establish the New Democratic Youth League.

9. Some staff members in the logistics department often violate policies and discipline. Education should be effectively strengthened to improve the political and professional level of logistics personnel, improve management, supply, hygiene, and other work, and ensure the smooth completion of various tasks of the army.

II. Launch a Production Movement.

In addition to defending the country, consolidating security, and strengthening training, the army must also undertake a part of the production tasks, so that our People's Liberation Army is not only a national defense army, but also a production army, so as to improve its own life, save a part of the country's expenses, and cooperate with the people of the whole country to overcome the difficulties left over from the long-term war and accelerate the economic construction of the new democracy.

In order to achieve this glorious task, we must:

1. Study in detail the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions, strictly grasp the key point of production as increasing the wealth of society and the country through labor, prohibit engaging in commerce, oppose speculative and opportunistic ideas of seeking quick profits, accept the experience and lessons of past production, and implement the principle of taking both public and private interests into account, so as to create a mass movement for production.

2. Do a good job in preparing for this winter, establish production committees and production cooperatives, contact the people's governments of various provinces, investigate production objects, study the organization of labor, formulate longer-term plans and concrete steps, and raise production funds, tools, etc.

3. Strengthen the Party's leadership over production. Before production, do a good job in propaganda and mobilization. It must be understood that some new cadres and new soldiers lack understanding of the implementation of production tasks because they have not participated in the army's production movement. Explain the reasons clearly and enlighten their consciousness. After the production movement is launched, promptly exchange experiences, strengthen inspection, and correct possible errors and shortcomings.

4. Pay attention to the combination of production work and other work.

5. Pay attention to thrift, prevent corruption and waste. The dividends distributed by the unit should be used to improve the life of the troops, subsidize the shortage of funds for the construction of the army, and use a certain amount as capital for expanding reproduction.

III. Improve the leadership role of Party committees and branches, improve the democratic life of the Party and the masses. Strengthen organization and discipline, and define various work systems.

1. Improving the leadership role of Party committees and branches is the key to implementing the above tasks and work policies. According to the current situation, the first thing to do to improve the leadership role of Party committees and branches is to improve the democratic life of the Party, carry out criticism and self-criticism, clarify the rights and obligations of Party members, and promote the enthusiasm of all Party members. Make all actions that deviate from the Party's line and policies and violate the Party Constitution subject to the supervision of the entire Party, strengthen organization and discipline, and on this basis, unify the thought, will, and action of the entire Party, and unite the broad masses around the Party to struggle for the realization of the current and long-term tasks.

For this reason, it is necessary to stipulate a system for regular elections of Party committees (below the military and provincial military regions) and branches, and regular convening of Party congresses and representative meetings. In addition to the branch meeting held once a month in accordance with existing regulations, it should also be held once every three months to review the work report of the branch committee, adopt resolutions on the work of the next branch, and elect the branch committee. A Party congress should be held once every six months in the battalion, once a year in the regiment and division, and once every two years in the military and provincial military region. The tasks are to review the work report of the Party committee, adopt resolutions of the next Party committee, and elect the Party committee. Party committees above the regimental level should also hold no less than two Party representative meetings a year, with full preparation in advance to discuss one or two important tasks, and on the basis of democratic centralism, truly make the Party committee and branch the leadership core of the army. Correct the phenomenon of only convening cadre meetings, being accustomed to orders and decisions from the head of the army, and weakening the leadership role of the Party. On the other hand, we should prevent and correct the tendency of the Party committee and branch to handle all affairs and hinder the active role of the head system. It is required that within one year, Party committees and branches at all levels should be universally rectified and strengthened in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism, and a solid foundation should be laid.

2. The Revolutionary Soldiers Committee (or机关 club) of the company is an extremely important organizational form that constantly consolidates the connection between the Party and the masses, improves the democratic life of the masses, thereby enlightening the consciousness of the broad masses and promoting their enthusiasm to ensure the completion of various tasks. Therefore, Party committees and branches should strengthen the leadership of the Revolutionary Soldiers Committee. On the basis of the past three major democracies, highly promote democracy, and make the Party's and administrative decisions, orders, calls, and proposals become the conscious actions of the masses through the Party's propaganda activities. At the same time, through the organization and work of the Revolutionary Soldiers Committee, all decisions made by our Party and administrative leadership should be subject to the inspection of the masses at any time, absorb the experience created by the masses, and supplement and enrich the shortcomings of the leadership. For this reason, it is stipulated that in addition to the general soldiers' meeting, the company should hold a soldiers' meeting once every three months to review the work report of the Revolutionary Soldiers Committee, adopt resolutions on the work of the next Revolutionary Soldiers Committee, and re-elect the Revolutionary Soldiers Committee. The time for its convening is generally after the branch meeting, so as to arrange the work of the Revolutionary Soldiers Committee according to the branch's resolution, and the branch should strengthen the leadership of the Revolutionary Soldiers Committee. It is required that the Revolutionary Soldiers Committee be universally rectified once within one year to make it a mass organization with full democracy and enrich its work content.

3. The division and regiment levels should regularly (division every four months, regiment every two months) convene working and learning representative meetings to promote democracy, consolidate the connection between leadership and the masses, carry out new heroism movements, cultivate cadres and model heroes, and establish a performance appraisal system on this basis. At the end of the year, awards will be given, model heroes will be elected, and a model hero meeting will be held.

4. The main sign of regularization lies in making various tasks have unified systems and clear regulations to strictly define responsibilities, synchronize steps, and strengthen organization and discipline. Therefore, starting from the military region, efforts should be made to study and define various regular systems and regulations, but it must be clear that the current stage is still a transitional stage towards complete regularization. Systems and regulations of a military nature must be uniformly promulgated by the Central Military Commission. Therefore, the definition of various systems must be step by step, and requests for instructions and reports should be strengthened. The eagerness in regularization construction is harmful.

5. Strengthen the Party's leadership over security work. After the elimination of open armed enemies, we must raise our vigilance against hidden enemies and strengthen the struggle against espionage and special agents. We should follow the mass line, improve the consciousness and vigilance of the masses, strengthen the security work of机关, improve the work of specialized business and security departments, train security cadres, and carry out review work in a focused and step-by-step manner.

IV. Strengthen the organization, education, and production of the militia.

In addition to the army continuing to eliminate bandits and special agents and consolidate urban and rural order, the organization and work of the militia should be improved and strengthened.

1. The main ideological problem currently existing in the militia is complacency. In this year's winter training, the focus should be on solving this ideology, improving the militia organization, and strengthening the struggle against bandits and special agents ideologically and organizationally, so as to lay a preliminary foundation for the future compulsory military service system.

2. At the same time, during the winter training, production education for the militia should be strengthened. Because the militia is the main labor force in rural areas, and the peasants must recuperate and develop production after a long period of war, it is necessary to encourage the militia to play an exemplary backbone role in production labor, oppose the hooligan ideology, and combine this education with strengthening the struggle against bandits and special agents.

3. Implement the education of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and cherishing public property, so as to cultivate good national ethics.

Strengthening the work of the militia is not only the responsibility of the military regions of each province (only the main responsibility), but also each unit has the responsibility to help the militia stationed in the area.

The work tasks for 1950 are arduous, but we have full confidence in completing them. As long as we strengthen the leadership of the Party committee, the military, political, and logistics departments are in step, and mobilize the wisdom and enthusiasm of the entire army, we can overcome all difficulties and achieve the victory of various tasks.

    人民解放军华北军区
    指示一九五零年工作
    规定三项总任务：加强整训，开展生产运动，肃清残余匪特。
    【本报讯】中国人民解放军华北军区在一九四九年十二月廿日发出关于一九五○年工作的指示，全文如下：
    华北完全解放半年多以来，我军进行了整编训练和剿匪工作，获得了一定的成绩。主要表现在：部队日益巩固，学习情绪高涨；军事、政治、后勤各种工作与制度，开始走上轨道，巩固了城市的治安，保护了交通的安全，使盘踞地方的股匪，或则遭到歼灭，或则受到严重的打击。但由于战争环境转变为和平环境，工作内容、方法、方式、制度，及与之相适应的组织形式，对于我们来说，还是不熟习的，因此还必须有步骤地加以改进。现根据现有基础与新情况，特规定：华北军区一九五○年的总任务：一、进一步加强整训，二、开展生产运动，三、继续肃清残余匪特。
            四个中心工作
    为了实现这三大任务，我们应具体进行下列四个中心工作：
    一、进一步加强正规的军事、政治、文化教育。
    教育方针仍是系统的按步就班的正规教育。从长期着眼，有步骤地进行建设，在既有基础之上，加强计划性，并根据少而精的原则，以求收获确实的效果。时间分配上，连队教育仍为军事、政治、文化五、二、三的比例。团以上机关干部学习，则根据不同干部，有不同重点。
    １、在军事教育上。要求将第一期所学科目，贯彻到日常生活中，养成良好军人姿态与严格军事生活习惯，初步达到一切工作上、生活上有秩序有纪律，各级干部均能履行自己的职责。然后进行技术教育（投弹、射击、刺杀、土工作业），要求懂得一般武器之性能，养成爱护武器之习惯，了解简单的学理与熟练地掌握使用武器。进行各个战斗教育，打下战斗教育的基础。通讯、侦察、轻重机枪、迫击炮、六○炮等部队教育，除复习第一期科目及准步兵计划进行单个战斗教育外，技术教育时间，进行本身业务技术教育。骑兵、炮兵、工兵教育计划另订。师以下部队军事干部，要求能够组织领导战士学习，做到会讲、会作、会教，并加强内务教育，以提高教育管理能力，机关干部则学习基本的军事知识与研究业务。
    ２、在政治教育上，部队应在永远是一个战斗队的觉悟基础之上，继续加强爱国主义与国际主义的教育，以提高全军人员的党的政策水平，培养爱国家、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物的良好品质。除此仍应加强讲报工作，以充实部队政治生活。部队营连干部除参加连队政治课外，并从加强教学准备中，提高思想政治水平。机关干部甲乙组一般于明年二月底前，学完社会发展简史，从二月至十月底，学习政治经济学（甲组用列昂节也夫本，乙组用薛暮桥本）十一月至十二月底学习共产党宣言，并以一定时间学习时事政策。丙组则停止理论学习，以学文化为重点，并进行时事政策学习。
    ３、在文化教育上，部队应以消灭文盲为重点，在一年之内，一般达到识七百字左右，作到四会（会写、会读、会讲、会用），看懂浅近书报。文化水平较高的战士和连队干部，除继续提高阅读写作能力外，以大力组织与帮助连队消灭文盲。部队中并应确定一周一次卫生课（占用文化课时间）的制度，结合公共卫生工作（洗衣、理发、灭虫等），以增进部队的健康。普遍建立机关工余补习学校，一切文化程度低的干部，均应以补习文化为学习重点，已学完中级国文算术者，视部队性质，酌增历史、地理、理化等课程。其目的在于两三年内，使我们干部均能获得基本的文化知识，提高自学能力，便于掌握马列主义与毛泽东思想及现代军事科学与技术。
    ４、业务学习，一般结合工作进行，专门技术干部，使用其他干部文化补习时间，进行技术学习与研究。
    ５、我们要在一年以内，从加强在职干部学习、做好教育准备工作、定期召集工学代表会，并辅之以干部轮训，将现有干部能力提高一步。
    ６、进行半年一次的学习考绩制度。
    ７、为了活跃学习情绪，增进教育收效，活跃生活，健壮身体应开展与军政文教育相结合的体育文化娱乐活动。一九五○年春季或秋季，军区召开一次运动会，检阅军事政治教育及体育文娱的工作。文艺工作应将创作人才必要地集中，以大力解决剧本与歌曲的创作，专业文工团应加强对部队文艺的指导与演出工作。
    ８、配备与训练青年工作干部，普遍建立新民主主义青年团。
    ９、后勤部门部分工作人员，常有违犯政策纪律现象，应有效地加强教育，提高后勤人员的政治、业务水平，健全经理、供给、卫生等工作，保证军队各种任务的顺利完成。
    二、开展生产运动。
    军队除保卫国防、巩固治安和加强整训以外，还必须负担一部分生产任务，使我人民解放军不仅是一支国防军，而且是一支生产军，借以改善自己的生活，节省一部分国家的开支，并协同全国人民克服长期战争所遗留下来的困难，加速新民主主义的经济建设。
    为了实现这一光荣任务，我们必须：
    １、详细研究毛主席指示的精神，严格掌握生产的重点在于以劳动增加社会和国家的财富，禁止从事商业，反对投机取巧、希图暴利的思想，接受过去生产中的经验与教训，并实行公私兼顾原则，将生产造成群众运动。
    ２、做好今冬准备工作，建立生产委员会与生产合作社的组织，与各省人民政府取得联系，调查生产对象，研究劳动力的组织，订出较长时期的计划和具体的步骤，并筹好生产资金、工具等。
    ３、加强党对生产的领导，在生产之前，做好宣传动员工作，要懂得一部分新干部新战士，由于没有参加过军队生产运动，对执行生产任务是缺乏认识的，要讲清道理，启发他们的自觉。在生产运动展开之后，要及时交流经验，加强检查，纠正可能发生的错误与缺点。
    ４、注意生产工作与共他工作的结合。
    ５、注意节约，防止贪污浪费现象，单位所分红利，应用作改善部队生活，补助军队建设事业经费之不足，并以一定数量作为扩大再生产的资本。
    三、健全党委支部领导作用，健全党的与群众的民主生活。加强组织
    性与纪律性，厘定各种工作制度。
    １、健全党委支部领导作用，是贯彻执行上述任务与工作方针的关键，而健全党委支部领导作用，根据目前情况，首先须健全党的民主生活，开展批评与自我批评，明确党员的权利与义务，发扬全体党员的积极性，使一切离开党的路线政策与违背党章的行为，获得全党的监督，加强组织性纪律性，在这个基础之上，全党统一思想、统一意志、统一行动，并团结广大群众在党的周围，为实现当前的与远大的任务而奋斗。
    为此，必须规定党委（军及省军区以下）与支部定期选举，与党的代表大会、代表会议定期召开的制度，支部大会除照既有规定每月召开一次外，还应每三个月召开一次，审查支部委员会工作报告，通过下届支部工作的决议，选举支部委员会。营半年召开党代表大会一次，团、师每年召开党代表大会一次，军、省军区两年召开党代表大会一次，其任务为审查党委工作报告，通过下届党委决议，选举党委。团以上党委并应每年召开不少于两次的党的代表会议，事先有充分准备地讨论一两项重要工作，在民主集中的基础之上，使党委和支部真正成为军队中的领导核心，纠正只召开干部会，习惯于首长命令决定，削弱党的领导作用的现象，另一方面，应防止与纠正党委与支部事务包办，妨碍首长制的积极作用的偏向，要求在一年之内，将各级党委及支部依据民主集中原则，普遍加以整顿和加强，打下巩固的基础。
    ２、连队革命军人委员会（或机关俱乐部），是经常巩固党与群众的联系，健全群众的民主生活，从而启发广大群众的觉悟，发扬他们的积极性，以保证各种任务完成的极为重要的组织形式，因此党委与支部应加强对革命军人委员会的领导，在过去三大民主的基础上，高度发扬民主，使党与行政决定、命令、号召与主张，通过党的宣传活动，成为群众自觉的行动，同时通过革命军人委员会的组织与工作，使我党与行政领导的一切决定，随时获得群众的检验，吸收群众创造经验，补充丰富领导之不足。为此规定连队除一般军人大会外，应每三个月召开军人大会一次，审查革命军人委员会工作报告，通过下届革命军人委员会工作的决议，改选革命军人委员会，其召开时间，一般地在支部大会之后，以便根据支部决议，布置革命军人委员会的工作，支部加强对革命军人委员会的领导。要求在一年之内，将革命军人委员会作一次普遍的整顿，使之成为有充分民主的群众组织，并充实其工作内容。
    ３、师与团两级应定期（师四个月、团两个月）召集工作学习代表会议，以发扬民主，巩固领导与群众的联系，开展新英雄主义运动，培养干部与英模，并在此基础之上，建立考绩制度，于年终评奖，选举英模，召开英模大会。
    ４、正规化的主要标志，在于使各种工作，有统一的制度，明确的条例，以严格职责，齐一步调，加强组织性纪律性。因此从军区为始，应努力于研究厘定各种正规制度条例，但是必须清楚，目前尚在走向完全正规化的过渡阶段，带全军性的制度条例，必须经过中央军委统一颁发，因此厘定各种制度，必须是有步骤的，并应加强请示报告，正规化建设中的急躁情绪，是有害的。
    ５、加强党对保卫工作的领导。在公开的武装的敌人消灭之后，我们必须提高对暗藏敌人的警惕，加强反间谍反特务的斗争。我们应走群众路线，提高群众的觉悟与警惕性，并加强机关保卫工作，提高专门业务与保卫部门的工作，培养训练保卫干部，有重点地有步骤地进行审查工作。
    四、加强民兵组织教育与生产。
    除军队继续肃清匪特巩固城乡秩序外，应健全和加强民兵的组织和工作。
    １、当前在民兵中存在的思想问题，主要是麻痹思想，今年冬训中，应以解决这一思想为主，并健全民兵组织，求得思想上组织上加强对匪特的斗争，为今后义务兵役制打下初步基础。
    ２、同时在冬训中，应加强对民兵的生产教育，因民兵为农村主要劳动力，而农民在长期战争之后，确须生息休养，恢复发展生产，为此必须鼓励民兵在生产劳动中起模范骨干作用，反对二流子思想，并将这一教育，与加强对匪特斗争结合起来。
    ３、贯彻爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财产的教育，以养成良好的国民公德。
    加强民兵工作，不仅只是各省军区的责任（只是主要责任），同时各部队亦有帮助驻地民兵的责任。
    一九五○年的工作任务是艰巨的，但是我们有充分的信心加以完成，只要我们加强了党委的领导，军、政、后勤步调一致，动员全军的智慧和积极性，我们就可以战胜一切困难，取得各种工作的胜利。
                                    一九四九年十二月二十日
