Beijing Automobile Repair Factory After Reform:

Continuously Breaks Production Quotas
Over One Hundred Production Models Emerge in the Entire Factory

[This newspaper's dispatch] In recent months, the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory has seen an unprecedented surge in production enthusiasm among all its employees, breaking through the original production quotas one after another. The production speed of many automobile parts in October has increased more than twice compared to August and September. For example, the production of cast aluminum pistons took an average of 40 minutes per piece in August and September, but only 15 and a half minutes in October; turning aluminum pistons took an average of 48 minutes per piece in August and September, but only 15 minutes in October; a complete overhaul of a heavy truck took 1280 working hours in August, but only 480 hours in October. Significant achievements have also been made in reducing costs. The average processing cost of cast aluminum pistons was reduced by 70 percent per piece compared to August. The average processing cost of turned aluminum pistons was reduced by 59.3 percent per piece compared to August.

		Rectifying the Organization, Improving Leadership, and Defining the Policy of Relying on Workers to Develop Production
The reason for achieving the above results is primarily because the factory, after reforming its leadership in July of last year, clearly established the correct policy of relying on workers to develop production and giving priority to production in its guiding ideology. The factory established a Factory Management Committee in September of last year. Meetings are held twice a month to solve major issues related to production and factory management. The entire factory's employees are mobilized to come up with ideas to run the factory well.

The trade union and Communist Youth League cadres have also clearly established the viewpoint of "production first" and grasped the correct principle of "solving workers' welfare issues through the development of production," and carried out appropriate education among the workers based on this principle. Furthermore, whenever possible, the factory has established its own workers' cooperative, coal briquette factory, and flour mill, supplemented the equipment of the clinic, and appropriately solved the workers' welfare problems.

Secondly, the factory rectified its organization, streamlined a group of non-production personnel, and made appropriate adjustments to personnel without fixed work. This alone can save 58,325 catties of rice in expenses per month. At the same time, a necessary technical office was added to specialize in research on improving technology.

Following this, through the Management Committee and democratic discussions, all non-production activities during production time, such as haircuts and meetings, were canceled. Daily production plans and strict and reasonable inspection, attendance, and reward systems were established. The management system of registration and custody at all levels in various workshops and warehouses was strengthened.

In order to ensure the victorious completion of production tasks, the Party and Youth League branches called on Party and Youth League members to play a leading role. Trade union and Party groups were established to unite and educate individual backward employees. At the same time, in the process of recruiting new Party and Youth League members, it was clearly proposed that "good production" be the main condition. The basic concept of "everything for production" was gradually established among everyone.

		Workers' Production Enthusiasm Soars, Production Emulation Launched Automatically
After the above rectification, a solid foundation was laid for the factory's production development. In early October, after returning from participating in the National Day celebrations, workers began to brew a production emulation in joy and excitement. The first to break the record was Liu Hengwen, a worker who turned aluminum pistons. He suddenly increased his output from nine pistons per shift to twenty-one. The current highest record is thirty-two per shift. His achievements immediately motivated other workers in the fourth section of the piston workshop. Workers in the third and second sections also expressed their unwillingness to fall behind. In this way, the entire second machine shop launched a production emulation, causing the cast piston blanks from the foundry shop to immediately be in short supply. Workers in the foundry shop automatically held a meeting that day to study how to increase output. Technician Wang Yuquan came up with a solution to remove the clay on the aluminum melting pot, which could speed up the aluminum melting and save coal. Not only did it guarantee the supply of the second machine shop, but it also reduced costs by 59.3 percent.

By early November, a production emulation craze had formed throughout the factory. Wang Zhonghe of the rubber workshop took the initiative to give suggestions to the technicians and improved the rubber pressing machine. In the past, two people were responsible for watching one machine, and it was still in short supply. Now, he can manage it alone with ease. Wu Xuecheng, a copper smelter, improved the copper smelting method, reduced sand holes in castings, and saved coal and crucible.

The factory conducted a democratic award evaluation in November, rewarding 110 actively producing employees. Xiao Ming, director of the Municipal Trade Union, called on everyone to turn the factory into a model factory. All employees enthusiastically responded. The factory's administration is currently considering formulating a regular and permanent reward system to replace the award evaluation campaign, in order to consolidate and continue to promote workers' production enthusiasm.

    京汽车修配厂经过改革后
    连续突破生产定额
    全厂涌现百余生产模范
    【本报讯】北京汽车修配厂，最近几个月来，在全厂职工中普遍掀起了前所未有的生产热潮，接二连三地突破了原来的生产定额。许多汽车零件的生产速度，十月份已较八、九月份加快了一倍以上。如生产铸铝活塞，在八、九月间平均每件需时四十分钟，十月份仅需时十五分钟半；镟铝活塞在八、九月份平均每件需时四十八分钟，十月份仅需时十五分钟，八月份一辆载重车全部大修需一二八○工时，至十月份则仅需四八○时。在降低成本方面也有了显著成绩。铸铝活塞较八月份平均每件减低加工成本百分之七十。车铝活塞较八月份平均每件加工成本减低百分之五十九·三。
            整顿机构改进领导  明确依靠工人发展生产方针
    获得以上成绩的原因，首先是由于该厂从去年七月间改造领导以后，在领导思想上明确了依靠工人发展生产和生产第一的正确方针。该厂曾在去年九月成立了工厂管理委员会。每月开会两次，解决有关生产和工厂管理等重大问题。发动全厂职工大家想办法，办好工厂。
    在工会和党团干部思想上也明确树立了“生产第一”的观点，掌握了“从发展生产中解决工人福利”的正确原则，并以这一原则在工人中间进行了适当的教育。又在可能的条件下，建立了工人自己的合作社、煤球厂、磨粉厂，充实了医务所的设备，适当地解决了工人的福利问题。
    其次是整顿了机构，精简了一批非生产冗员，把无固定工作的人员也作了适当调整。仅此每月即可节省开支米五万八千三百二十五斤。同时又增设了必要的技术室，专门研究提高技术。
    接着又通过管委会和民主讨论，取消了在生产时间一切非生产活动，如理发、开会等。订出了每日的生产计划，和严格合理的检验、考勤、奖励等制度。加强了各场库按级负责登记的保管制度。
    为了保证生产任务的胜利完成，党团支部号召党、团员起带头作用。成立了工会和党的小组，团结与教育个别落后职工。同时在吸收新的党团员工作中，也明显提出以“生产好”为主要条件。逐渐树立起大家“一切为着生产”的基本观念。
            工人生产情绪高涨  自动展开生产竞赛
    经过以上的整顿，奠定了该厂发展生产的坚实基础。十月初，工人们参加了开国盛典回来后，在欢欣兴奋之余，即开始酝酿生产竞赛。最先突破纪录的是镟铝活塞工人刘恒文。他从定额每工九个活塞，一下子突增到每工二十一个。现在最高纪录是每工三十二个。他的成绩马上带动了活塞间第四部的其他工人。第三部和第二部的工人也表示不甘落后。这样整个第二机工间就展开了生产竞赛，使铸工间铸的活塞毛坯立刻呈现供不应求。铸工间工人当天就自动开会研究怎样提高产量。技术员王玉泉想出办法，把熔铝锅上的粘土去掉，这样可以加快熔铝速度，节省焦炭。不但保证了第二机工间的供应，并且使成本降低了百分之五九·三。
    到十一月初，全厂已经形成生产竞赛热潮。橡胶场的王忠和主动地给技师提意见，改进了压橡机。过去两个人负责看一部机器还供不应求，现在他一个人看管便绰有余裕。熔铜工人吴学成改进了熔铜方法，减少了铸品中的砂眼，并且节省了焦炭和钳锅。
    该厂在十一月进行了一次民主评奖工作，奖励了一百一十个积极生产的职工。市工会主任萧明号召大家把这个厂子搞成模范工厂。全厂职工一致热烈响应。该厂行政上现正酝酿制订正规的、经常的奖励制度，来代替评奖运动，以巩固和继续推动工人的生产热情。
