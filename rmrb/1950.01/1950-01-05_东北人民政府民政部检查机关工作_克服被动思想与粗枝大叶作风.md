    Northeast People's Government Ministry of Civil Affairs Inspects Agency Work
    Overcoming Passive Thinking and Careless Work Style
    [Reported by this newspaper] From December 13th to 21st of last year, the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the Northeast People's Government conducted a comprehensive inspection of the work of the entire agency. The inspection revealed several shortcomings in the work: The Preferential Treatment of Military Dependents Section issued instructions for Spring Festival support of the army but failed to plan thoroughly in advance. The instructions were only written by December 28th, making them late when issued. When the Civil Affairs Division requested statistical figures from various provinces and cities, it failed to develop a uniform form in advance, resulting in different items being reported, making it impossible to compile statistics. The Ethnic Affairs Section, when conducting rural surveys, subjectively formulated a large set of program outlines, resulting in significant effort expended to bring back a large pile of fragmented materials that could not be used, creating a burden instead of solving problems. The typing room frequently made typos and failed to research improvements, focusing only on the superficial appearance of making the typed materials look nice. A careless work style also existed, such as the Civil Affairs Division sending a reply telegram intended for Heilongjiang Province to Liaoxi. The Cadre Division sent a letter to Taierzhuang Street in the same city but omitted "in this city," causing it to be mailed to Taierzhuang in Shandong. The approval of a certain cadre in Lüda for "concurrent positions" was mistakenly written as "removal from positions." Some cadres even hastily dealt with drafting documents and answering questions without careful study, pushing them up the chain of command, resulting in responsible comrades having to expend more energy to resolve them.
    The leading cadres of the ministry also found that a handicraft industry leadership style still existed. They had failed to use the organization to promote work, to bring into play everyone’s initiative, and to adhere to systems to guarantee the work. Cadres at all levels conducted ideological self-criticisms and unanimously agreed that collective leadership should be implemented in the future, establishing a system of responsibility by level and by person, clarifying the scope of work and relationships between departments and sections, and skillfully using meetings to discuss, deploy, and inspect work. On an individual level, the most important thing is to strengthen the revolutionary sense of responsibility, proactively and systematically study professional skills, bring creativity into play, improve work, and especially overcome the careless, superficial, and unthorough work style, and to guarantee this through new systems and discipline.
    After this inspection, all cadres have undergone new transformations. Each department, section, and office is discussing and formulating specific work plans to guarantee that work is improved from an ideological, organizational, and systematic perspective.

    东北人民政府民政部检查机关工作
    克服被动思想与粗枝大叶作风
    【本报讯】东北人民政府民政部于去年十二月十三日至二十一日，进行了全机关的工作检查。检查结果，发现工作中不少缺点：优抚科发春节劳军指示，事先未周密计划，到十二月二十八日才写好，发出时已经晚了；民政处向各省市要统计数字时，事先未制定统一的表格，以致各处报来的项目各异，无法统计；民族科下乡调查，主观地制定一大套计划提纲，结果花费很大力量，带回来的一大堆片断材料用不上，不能解决问题，反而形成负担；打字室经常打错字，未钻研改进，却只在形式外表上注意，如何把打出的材料装饰得好看一点。工作中粗枝大叶的作风也存在，如民政处把答复黑龙江省的电报打到辽西去了；干部处往本市台儿庄街发信，不写上本市而邮到了山东台儿庄；批答旅大某干部“兼职”写成“免职”。甚至有些干部草拟文件与批答问题不加细心研究，草草应付了事，按级往上推，结果使负责同志要多费精力去解决。
    该部领导干部也检查出还有手工业领导方式存在，未能利用组织推动工作，把大家的积极性发挥起来，同时坚持制度来保证工作。各级干部都作了思想检讨，一致认为今后要集体领导，确定按级按人负责制度，明确各处科室的工作范围及关系，要善于通过会议来商讨、布置、检查工作。在个人方面最主要的是加强革命的责任心，主动地、有计划地钻研业务，发挥创造性，提高工作，尤其要克服粗枝大叶、不深入、不细致的工作作风，并从新的制度上与纪律上加以保证。
    经过这次检查之后，全体干部都有了新的转变，各处、科、室正在讨论制订具体工作计划，以便从思想上、组织上、制度上来保证把工作提高一步。
