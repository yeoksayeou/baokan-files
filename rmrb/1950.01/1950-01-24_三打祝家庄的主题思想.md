The Theme of Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang
Wei Chenxu

The theme of the first act (First Attack on Zhujiazhuang, also known as Shi Xiu Investigates the Village) is investigation and research to understand the enemy's situation. Song Jiang, due to his pride and impatience, did not value the work of understanding the enemy's situation. He rashly advanced and fell into an encirclement. Fortunately, Lin Chong had sent people to investigate the enemy's strength beforehand. When Song Jiang decided to take the risk of advancing immediately, Lin Chong advocated dividing the troops into two routes, one to attack and the other to follow up in support, which saved the army from the crisis of complete annihilation. Among the two leaders sent to scout the enemy's situation, Yang Lin was careless, acted like a veteran, did not rely on the masses, and did not listen to the patient advice of the new leader Shi Xiu, which led to him falling into an ambush and being captured by the enemy, failing to complete the task. Shi Xiu, on the other hand, was meticulous, humble, and being from a firewood-selling background, was good at concealing himself and approaching the masses, so he was able to find out the military secrets of Zhujiazhuang, guide Song Jiang and others out of danger, and successfully complete the task given by his superiors.

The theme of the second act (Second Attack on Zhujiazhuang, also known as Divide and Conquer) is to divide the enemy and defeat them one by one. In the first advance, Liangshan not only suffered losses from Zhujiazhuang, but also suffered attacks from the Hujiazhuang. Only then did they realize that to break Zhujiazhuang, they must first divide the enemy's alliance and isolate them. First, they strived for the neutrality of the Li Family Village, then they designed to capture Hu Sanniang alive, forcing the Hujiazhuang to surrender and make peace, and then launched a fierce attack on Zhujiazhuang. However, they did not realize that with primitive military equipment, they could not capture a strongly defended city by simply attacking fiercely. Therefore, they suffered another defeat militarily.

The theme of the third act (Third Attack on Zhujiazhuang, also known as Internal and External Coordination) is internal and external coordination. Song Jiang, Lin Chong and others accepted the experiences of the previous two failures, and were enlightened by Zhong Lijing (the younger brother of the elder Zhong Li), a captured Zhuang guest from Zhujiazhuang. They recognized the importance of internal and external coordination, and sent Zhong Lijing and the newly arrived leaders Sun Li, Yue He, and Gu Dasao to Zhujiazhuang to work as internal agents (the latter three infiltrated through private social relations). After they entered the village, they vigorously launched underground activities, won over a part of the defending armed forces, and gained the sympathy of the masses for Liangshan, which coordinated with the main force's attack to open Zhujiazhuang and completely annihilate the enemy.

The above is the theme of the revised version of Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang.

    三打祝家庄的主题思想
    魏晨旭
    第一幕（一打祝家庄，又名石秀探庄）的主题是调查研究，了解敌情。宋江因骄傲，急躁，不重视了解敌情的工作。冒然进兵，陷入重围。幸得林冲事前派人探明敌人虚实，当宋江决意马上冒险进兵时，林冲又主张分兵两路，一路前去攻打，一路随后接应，才挽救了全军覆没的危机。在派去打探敌情的两个头领中，杨林因粗心大意，摆老资格，不依靠群众，不听从新头领石秀的耐心劝告，以致误入埋伏，被敌人拿获，不能完成任务。石秀则因精细，虚心，又是卖柴出身，善于隐蔽自己，接近群众，故能探出祝家庄的军事机密，引导宋江等脱离险地，出色地完成了上级所给与的任务。
    第二幕（二打祝家庄，又名各个击破）的主题是分化敌人，各个击破。梁山伯在第一次进兵中，不仅吃了祝家庄的亏，还遭受到扈家庄的袭击，这才认识到要破祝家庄，须先分化敌人的联盟，使他孤立。首先争取李家庄的中立，然后设计生擒扈三娘，逼使扈家庄屈服求和，然后对祝家庄展开猛烈进攻，但没有认识到在原始的军事装备下只凭猛攻猛打，亦不能夺取坚固设防的城市，故在军事上又吃了败仗。
    第三幕（三打祝家庄，又名里应外合）的主题是里应外合。宋江、林冲等接受了前两次失败的经验，又得到祝家庄被俘庄客甲钟离进（钟离老人之弟）的启示，认识到里应外合的重要，遂派钟离进和新来的头领孙立、乐和、顾大嫂等到祝家庄去作内应（后三人是通过私人的社会关系混进去的）。他们进庄后，便有力地展开了地下活动。争取了一部分守城武装，取得了群众对梁山的同情，配合主力的进攻，才打开祝家庄，全部歼灭敌人。
    以上所述，就是三打祝家庄修订本的主题思想。
