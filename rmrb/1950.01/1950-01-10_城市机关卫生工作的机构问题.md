The practice of establishing a health section or clinic within every government agency has been a long-standing system in the liberated areas. Under the policy of actively safeguarding the health of government agency staff, this system has been necessary, appropriate, and fruitful in the past environment, playing a significant role. Moreover, adapted to the past environment, the agency health section/clinic system was the only feasible option. The emergence of this system was primarily due to two factors: First, government agencies, with their quasi-military nature, could not remain in one place for long, thus necessitating a system modeled after the army, with health units established at the company/regiment level. Second, government agencies were located in rural areas, with dispersed residences and inconvenient transportation, inevitably leading each agency to establish a health section or clinic based on the number of its employees. The advantage of the agency health section/clinic system was that it ensured medical care was available in a dispersed environment and during periods of mobility.

However, considering the current situation, with the nationwide victory of the revolution and the relocation of the vast majority of government agencies to cities, it is worth studying whether the agency health section/clinic system should still be adopted. In environments that are not mobile and not too dispersed, the agency health section/clinic system can be replaced by a better system to improve the effectiveness of medical work. Naturally, for government agencies with a large number of employees, moving from a handicraft approach to a specialized, systematic work approach is progress and the only way to improve the efficiency of medical work. While not fully adaptable to rural areas today, it is essential in cities.

The specific method of transitioning medical units from dispersed to centralized is to establish joint outpatient clinics and appoint health workers in more remote government agencies. The former is intended to concentrate health and treatment work; the latter ensures government agencies have their own health organizations, with the aim of not only treating diseases but also preventing them. However, for agencies with a small number of employees (e.g., hundreds or thousands), establishing small, independent health units to simultaneously carry out prevention and treatment work while aiming to improve their efficiency is not achievable.

The practice of each government agency having only a few health personnel or just a doctor and a nurse in charge of medical work is a method that was only adopted out of necessity in the past. This method, in the present and future, has its shortcomings:

First, to carry out treatment work perfectly or relatively perfectly, it is necessary to assemble a team of personnel to work collectively with a division of labor. There must be complete registration, comprehensive examination, and systematic treatment, none of which can be missing. One might ask, how can a government agency with only one or two doctors carry out systematic treatment? How can it break away from the handicraft approach? How can it increase medical efficiency?

Second, to carry out prevention work perfectly or relatively perfectly, it is even more necessary to assemble a team of personnel to work collectively with a division of labor. Moreover, prevention work is fundamentally a mass-based effort. Furthermore, cities differ from rural areas in that they have dense populations, and health management should be divided by area, with several government agencies working together.

Third, to improve medical efficiency, it is necessary to coordinate with a sound system of professional learning, and learning must be conducted collectively to be effective.

Medical units transition from dispersed to centralized, with the broad masses assisting in daily hygiene work and first aid.

Joint outpatient clinics can determine the number of medical personnel based on the number of people in their respective areas. Generally, the work can be divided into three parts: one part is internal medicine, including pediatrics and dermatology; one part is surgery, including ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and gynecology; the third part is the health care section, including environmental hygiene and epidemic prevention, cadre health care and health education, as well as maternal and child health (prenatal check-ups, midwifery, and child health guidance, etc.). Outpatient clinics can set up observation wards to retain special patients. Those who need hospitalization should be referred to hospitals. In terms of management, even if an outpatient clinic does not belong to the municipal government, it should establish contact with the municipal health bureau to receive regular guidance on public health work. The outpatient clinic can also establish close contact with large hospitals through the superior health authorities, inviting specialist doctors to visit the outpatient clinic every week to provide consultations and assist in professional education. Joint outpatient clinics should also become the hub or support point for public hospitals to connect with patients.

Government agencies that are relatively far from the joint outpatient clinic but still within the clinic's jurisdiction can appoint one health worker. The health worker should have received sufficient training in public health and first aid and be directly led by the health care section of the outpatient clinic. After improving the system of government agencies establishing health clinics independently to a joint outpatient clinic system, the inconveniences felt by government agency staff are: first, the fear that injuries or illnesses requiring emergency treatment (although rare in general government agencies) will be unattended to, but with the health worker system, this can be overcome. Second, there may also be a feeling of inconvenience in coming and going to see a doctor, but this is only a matter of habit. From the perspective of overall medical efficiency, the joint outpatient clinic system is undoubtedly superior to the independent health clinic.

Currently, cities have the conditions and possibilities to establish such outpatient clinics. How to establish an appropriate and standardized outpatient clinic medical system and health work system is a creative process. The above are only preliminary suggestions, and specific implementation requires the close study and creative improvement of comrades engaged in government agency health work in actual practice.

    城市机关卫生工作的机构问题
    黄树则
    凡一机关，都设一卫生科或一卫生所，这是解放区多年来的制度。在积极保障机关工作人员健康的方针下，这一制度在过去的环境中是需要的，适当的，有收获的，起过很大作用的。而且，适应于过去的环境，机关卫生科所制度也是唯一可能的制度。这制度的产生，第一由于机关的带有军队的性质，不能久驻一地，因此必须仿照连队的办法，按营团设卫生单位的办法来进行工作。第二由于机关处在农村，住处分散，交通不便，势必每一机关按其工作人员多寡，设卫生科或卫生所来进行工作。机关卫生科所制度的优点是：在分散的环境中不致有病无医；在流动的环境中不致有病无医。
    但依现在情况看来，在全国范围内革命胜利了，绝大多数的机关移住城市，是否仍需采取机关卫生科所制度呢，很有研究的必要。不是流动的环境，不是太分散的环境，为了提高医疗工作的效能，卫生科所制度实可以用另外更好的制度来代替。自然，人数多的工作机关要从手工业方式到专门的系统的工作方式，这是一个进步，这是提高医疗工作效能的唯一途径。在今天，虽然还不能完全适应于农村，但在城市，则是必需的。
    医疗单位从分散到集中的具体办法，是成立联合门诊部和在较远机关设保健员。前者为了集中进行卫生及治疗工作；后者为了组织机关有自设的卫生机构，其目的不仅在于治疗疾病，而且在于预防疾病。但人数少的机关（譬如几百人或上千人），自设小卫生单位，同时进行预防与治疗工作，并图提高其效能，是不能达到目的。
    每一机关设少数几个卫生人员或者仅仅一个医生一个护士来主持医疗工作，这只是过去不得不如此的办法。这种办法，在现在与今后看来，是有其缺点的：
    第一、要完善地或较完善地进行治疗工作，必须要集合一套人员，有分工的集体的去作，必须有完善的登记，全面的检查，系统的治疗，三者不可缺一。试问，一个机关里仅有一两个医生，怎样进行有系统的治疗呢？怎样能够脱离手工业方式呢？怎样能增高医疗效率呢？
    第二、要完善的或较完善的进行预防工作，更必须集合一套人员，有分工地集体的去做，同时，预防工作，基本上就是群众性的工作，而且城市与农村不同，人口密集，卫生的管理自应以地区划分，连合数机关进行为宜。
    第三、要提高医疗效能，必须配合以较健全的业务学习制度，而学习也必须集体进行才能收效。
    医疗单位从分散到集中，广大群众辅助进行日常卫生工作和急救工作。
    联合门诊部可按其所辖区域人员的多寡，具体规定医务人员的数目。一般按工作可分为三部分：一部分是内科，包括小儿科，皮肤科；一部分是外科，包括眼科，耳鼻喉科，妇科；第三部分是保健科，包括环境卫生和防疫，干部保健和卫生教育，以及妇婴卫生（产前检查、助产、儿童健康指导等）。门诊部可设观察病房，留治特殊的病员，应当住院的自应介绍到医院去。在管理上，即或不属于市府机关的门诊部，也应与市卫生局取得联系，以便经常获得关于公共卫生工作的指导，门诊部还可经上级卫生机关与大的医院取得密切的联系，约请专门医师每周去门诊部临诊，同时帮助业务教育的进行。联合门诊部同时应成为公立医院联系病员的枢纽或支点。
    距离联合门诊部较远的机关，也在门诊部辖区之内者，可设保健员一人。保健员应受过相当的公共卫生与急救的训练，属门诊部保健科直接领导。由机关单独设卫生所的制度，改进为联合门诊部制度后，机关工作人员感到不便的：第一是唯恐需要急救处理的病伤（虽然这在一般机关内是仅少见的）无人处理，但有了保健员的制度，这一点自能克服。第二或者还感觉着来往看病不便，但这只是习惯问题，若是从整个医疗效能上看，联合门诊部制度无论如何是优越于单独的卫生所的。
    目前，各城市已有成立这样门诊部的条件与可能，如何建立适当的正规的门诊部医疗制度以及卫生工作制度，是一个创设的过程。以上所述，仅是初步的建议，具体实施还有待于机关卫生工作同志的细密研究与在实际工作中创造改进。
