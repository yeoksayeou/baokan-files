    From Recovery to Development
    —The Beijing Municipal Public Industry in the Past Year
            A Stark Contrast
    Under the reactionary rule and corrupt management of the Kuomintang, most of Beijing's publicly owned industries collapsed and ceased operations, and the remaining ones were on the verge of bankruptcy. The glass factory established during the Japanese occupation finally closed down eight months before liberation after being looted and sabotaged by the Kuomintang, and every building in the factory was dilapidated. The Beijing Public Bus Company was auctioned off by the Kuomintang for forty-four good buses six months before liberation, and it also collapsed. By the time of liberation, only five of the seventy-two dilapidated buses could be driven. The "North China Pharmaceutical Factory," established during the Japanese occupation, was auctioned off for its medical equipment repair shop by the Kuomintang, leaving only three workers and six staff members to make soap for a living. The Qinghe Woolen Mill, with a history of forty years, was also forced to shut down before liberation due to a lack of raw materials. The Yanjing Paper Mill, the Xin Jian Pottery Factory, and the Xin Jian Ice Factory had all been shut down for several months or years before liberation. When the People's Government took over Beijing after liberation, only six of the fourteen municipal public factories were operating (excluding state-owned industries such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant).
    The People's Government began to restore and develop the people's industry from these ruins. The government not only had to make great efforts to get the factories up and running, but also had to bear the salaries of a large number of redundant staff in the existing bureaucratic institutions. After a year of efforts, the organizational structure of each unit was rectified, and the bank loaned more than 20.4 million catties of millet to solve the financial difficulties, enabling the municipal public industry, which had been paralyzed in the Kuomintang era, to grow universally. The Xin Jian Glass Factory repaired 164 dilapidated factory buildings, added six new buildings, and the number of employees increased from more than 20 at the time of resumption to more than 190. The daily output of glass was 3,000 catties, more than twice the highest record (900 catties) during the Kuomintang period. The Public Bus Company has repaired 61 broken buses and added 71 new buses, with more than 30 buses running on the streets every day. Now, all 22 production units under the Municipal Bureau of Industry have not only started operations, but also universally exceeded the pre-liberation level in terms of product quality. This is a stark contrast between the municipal public industry before and after the liberation of Beijing.
            Relying on All Employees to Restore and Develop Production
    The restoration and development of each factory is inseparable from the correct leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal People's Government, as well as the improvement of the class consciousness and active work of all employees. After the liberation of Beijing, each factory adopted payment in kind to ensure the income of workers. Workers in each unit also established their own organizations—trade unions—under the leadership of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, organizing and educating workers. The Party, government, and trade union in each unit cooperated closely to strictly implement streamlining and thrift, improve quality, overcome waste, reduce costs, and streamline institutions and adjust personnel in a step-by-step manner, and establish systems. Each unit gradually promoted democratic management, and the employees of each factory universally changed their labor attitude, giving full play to the creativity and enthusiasm of the working class, and there were many instances of processing contributions and technological improvements. Things that were unimaginable during the Japanese puppet and Kuomintang rule appeared continuously. In terms of improving productivity, water meter repair workers at the Water Company used to repair a maximum of four meters per person per day before liberation, but now they repair an average of seven meters per person per day, and the repairs are more careful than before. In terms of thrift, workers in the boiler room of the Qinghe Woolen Mill burned 265.5 tons of coal in June 1948, but in June after liberation, they burned only 92.3 tons of coal, even though they used more steam than before. The reason is that the coal has been burned thoroughly, and dozens of people used to rush to pick up the coal ash that was dumped out, but now no one even cares about it. In terms of technological innovation, employees of the tram company repair shop manufactured fire glass rings and automatic gate boxes, which they had never made before, to replace foreign goods, overcoming the difficulty of lacking such components when manufacturing new cars. In terms of operation and management, each unit has generally established a meeting of responsible persons from the Party, government, and trade union. The monthly production plan is generally discussed by all employees or group leaders. The workers themselves have also formulated labor discipline. Under the leadership of the Bureau of Industry, each unit has initially established systems for cost accounting, warehouse management, and work-day records, reversing the old habits and conservative ideas of some employees, and has more accurate statistics and evaluations. Relying on this new labor attitude and system, each unit has achieved initial results in improving quality and reducing costs. The Tram Company abolished the shift system that had been used for 25 years since the company was founded, and implemented the progressive conductor responsibility system from November last year, reducing the failure rate from 12.9 times per car per month (October) to 5.5 times (December). The price of tap water was reduced from two catties of millet per ton at the time of takeover to one catty. From August to December, the Yanjing Paper Mill reduced the proportion of unqualified products from 21.8% of the total output to 2.9%, and increased production efficiency from an average of 1.73 reams per person per day to 2.66 reams, reducing costs by more than a quarter.
            Overcome Shortcomings and Take a Further Step!
    In the past year, although each unit has made preliminary achievements in democratic management and enterprise management, some shortcomings still exist. In the early stage of promoting democratic management, the responsible persons of the Party, government, and trade union in each unit lacked a unified understanding of this work and took detours for a time. Up to now, only six units have established factory management committees, and some of them are just a formality. On the trade union side, the concept of production first was gradually clarified later. The production system in each unit is still not sound enough. Unreasonable wages have not been completely adjusted. Labor insurance regulations have not been drafted. Workers' welfare has not been properly taken care of, and outstanding employees have not been properly rewarded. Collective contracts have not been signed. These tasks should all be completed this year.
    At the end of last year, the Bureau of Industry clearly announced this year's production policy: on the premise of improving quality and reducing costs, the output of each unit should be increased by 20% to 30% compared with last year. The average daily output of the Yanjing Paper Mill at the end of 1949 was 250 reams, and this year, with the newly established branch factory, it plans to produce 407 reams per day. In terms of operation, the Bureau of Industry has instructed each unit that it does not need to lose money this year. It needs to hand over certain tasks to the government, but the cost should be low. In other words, it is not allowed to seek profits by increasing the selling price. The Bureau of Industry has stipulated the cost of products for each unit. The workers of each unit are enthusiastically discussing this plan to ensure its complete realization. Completing this new task is certainly not an easy task, but under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, relying on the efforts of all employees, we are confident and guaranteed that the capital's industry will move from recovery to development. In 1950, new records and labor heroes and creative models will surely emerge in batches.

    从恢复走向发展
    —一年来的北京市属公营工业
            鲜明的对比
    北京的公营工业，在国民党的反动统治和腐败经营下，大部分倒闭停工，剩下的也都濒于破产。在日寇统治时期成立的玻璃厂，经过国民党接收后的盗卖破坏，终于在解放前八个月倒闭，全厂房屋没有一间不坍塌破漏。北京公共汽车公司，在解放前半年，被国民党拍卖了四十四部好车，也终于倒闭，到解放时，破烂不堪的七十二辆车里，能开动的只有五辆。日寇统治时期成立的“北支药厂”，被国民党接收后，拍卖了医疗器械修理厂，只剩下三个工人和六个职员，靠造胰子维持生活。有四十年历史的清河制呢厂，解放前也因为原料缺乏，陷于停工状态。燕京造纸厂、新建窑业厂、新建制冰厂等，都是在解放前就已经停工了几月或几年。北京解放后，人民政府接管时，市属十四个公营工厂，开工的只有六个（石景山钢铁厂等国营工业，不在内）。
    人民政府就在这些破烂摊子上开始恢复和发展人民的工业。政府不只要用大力使各厂开工，而且还要担负当时存在的官僚机构大批冗员的薪金。经过一年来的努力，整顿了各单位的组织机构，银行贷出两千零四十余万斤小米，解决资金困难，使在国民党时期陷于瘫痪状态的市属公营工业，普遍的生长起来。新建玻璃厂修好了破厂房一百六十四间，添盖新房六间，职工也从复工时的二十多人发展到一百九十多人，日产玻璃三千斤，超过国民党时期最高纪录（九百斤）两倍多。公共汽车公司已经修好破车六十一辆，增添大汽车七十一辆，每天在街上行驰的已经有三十多辆。现在市工业局所属的二十二个生产单位，不仅已全部开工，而且在产品的质量方面，普遍地超过了解放前的水平。这是北京解放前后市属公营工业的鲜明对比。
            依靠全体职工，恢复发展生产
    各厂的恢复与发展，是与中共北京市委会、北京市人民政府的正确领导以及全体职工阶级觉悟的提高与积极工作是分不开的。北京解放后，各厂就采用实物计薪，保证了工人的收入。各单位工人也先后建立了自己的组织——工会，在市总工会筹委会领导下，组织教育了工人。各单位党政工密切配合，厉行精简节约、提高质量、克服浪费、减低成本、有步骤的精简机构、调整人事、建立制度。各单位逐步推行民主管理，各厂职工普遍的改变了劳动态度，发挥了工人阶级的创造性和积极性，出现过多次加工献工和技术的改善。在日伪和国民党统治时期梦想不到的事，连续出现了。在提高生产率方面，自来水公司修水表工人，解放前最多每人每天修四个，现在平均每人每天修七个，而且修理得比以前还仔细。在节约方面，清河制呢厂锅炉房工人，在一九四八年六月份。烧煤二百六十五吨半，而解放后的六月份，用的汽比以前多了，却只烧了九十二点三吨煤。原因是煤已经烧透了，以前倒出去的煤灰，几十个人抢着检，现在倒出去的连理都没人理了。在技术创造方面，电车公司修造厂职工，自己制造了从来没有作过的火玻璃圈和自动闸盒，代替洋货，克服了制造新车时缺乏此种机件的困难。在经营管理方面，各单位普遍地建立了党政工负责人的碰头会，每月的生产计划，一般的都经过全体职工或小组长的讨论。工人自己也订了劳动纪律。在工业局领导下，各单位初步建立了成本核算、仓库保管、工作日录等制度，扭转了部分职工旧的习惯和保守观念，有了比较精确的统计和考工。依靠这种新的劳动态度和制度，各单位在提高质量，减低成本方面，已获得了初步成绩。电车公司废除了自公司成立以来沿用了廿五年的轮乘制，从去年十一月实行了进步的乘务负责制，使坏车率从每车每月十二点九次（十月）减至五点五次（十二月）。自来水的售价从接管时的每吨二斤小米，减到一斤。燕京造纸厂从八月到十二月，不合格的产品从全部产量百分之二十一点八减至二点九，生产效率从平均每人每天一点七三令提高到二点六六令，使成本减低了四分之一强。
            克服缺点，再进一步！
    一年来，各单位在管理民主化和经营企业化方面，虽然有了初步的成绩，但有些缺点仍然存在着。在推行民主管理的初期，各单位党政工负责人，对这项工作缺乏统一的认识，一度走了弯路。到现在，成立工厂管理委员会的单位才有六个，而且有的还只是一种形式。工会方面，以生产为第一的观念，到后来才逐渐明确。各单位的生产制度，到现在还不够健全。不合理的工资还没有完全调整。劳保条例还没有拟定。工人福利还没得到适当的照顾，优秀的职工没得到适当的奖励。集体合同还没有订立。这些工作，都应该在今年完成。
    工业局在去年年底，已经明确宣布了今年的生产方针，在提高质量、减低成本的条件下，各单位的产量要比去年提高百分之二十至三十。燕京造纸厂一九四九年底平均日产量二百五十令，今年加上新成立的分厂计划每天要出四百零七令。在经营方面，工业局已指示各单位今年不须再赔钱。需要对政府交一定的任务，但是成本还要低廉。换句话说，就是不得从增加售价来牟求利润。工业局已经规定了各单位产品成本的数额。各单位工人正热烈讨论这一计划，以保证它的彻底实现。完成这个新任务，当然不是一件容易的事，但是，在共产党和人民政府的领导之下，依靠着全体职工的努力，我们是有把握有信心的保证首都的工业，从恢复走向发展。在一九五○年里，新纪录和劳动英雄、创造模范，必定将一批一批的出现。
