    [By Our Own Correspondent] A cultural learning craze has swept through hundreds of thousands of soldiers in the North China People's Liberation Army, resulting in a relatively universal improvement in the cultural level of officers and soldiers. The vast majority of officers and soldiers come from the working people, who were deprived of the right to education by the Kuomintang's malgovernment and the criminal social system. For more than a decade, the North China People's Liberation Army, like other People's Liberation Army units, has attached great importance to its cultural education work, but in the tense and frequent warfare, it was actually impossible to carry it out step by step. After the end of the North China Liberation War, the North China People's Liberation Army entered a period of regular training in a relatively peaceful environment. The vast number of officers and soldiers in the People's Liberation Army have a very urgent need to learn culture, and this sentiment has been increasing with the victorious situation and the needs of the troops. Many cadres demanded to improve their culture so that they could study theory and organize experience. Soldiers demanded to be literate and read books. Therefore, the leadership placed cultural learning in a very important position in the instructions, accounting for three-tenths of the total regular training time, and put forward the slogan "Turn the North China People's Liberation Army into a huge military, political, and cultural school" and "Eliminate illiteracy in a planned way." Cadres and soldiers on the job were all assigned to various cultural learning classes according to their level. Those whose cultural level was equivalent to that of junior primary school were assigned to junior classes to study junior primary school courses; those whose cultural level was equivalent to that of senior primary school were assigned to intermediate classes to study junior middle school courses; those below the junior primary school level were assigned to literacy classes. Difficulties in teaching materials and teachers were resolved, and various teaching systems for cultural learning were formulated. In the past few months, the North China People's Liberation Army has used these specific tasks to welcome and organize a high tide of cultural learning in the troops. This education has now achieved good results in cultural learning, especially in the elimination of illiteracy. According to surveys, only a small number of illiterate people with less than 200 characters remain in the combat troops of the North China People's Liberation Army. Two divisions, XX, have completely eliminated illiteracy of less than 200 characters. In a certain division, each soldier learned an average of 218 characters in four months. In a certain company, before training, 80 people knew less than 50 characters, and now all but 6 people know more than 300 characters. In a certain regiment, before training, 77 soldiers could write simple letters, and now the number has increased to 287. Li Decai, the deputy division commander of a certain division, was one of the eighteen heroes of the Dadu River. He was very good at fighting, but he did not like to study in the past. During the war, he only carried cigarettes in his bag, not documents. During this training, he asked his guard to read the newspaper to him every night, and he always wrote down what he did on his notebook. If he couldn't write it, he would look it up in the dictionary. After three months of study, he can now write general communications and reports. He said: "This training is faster than the cultural learning in the previous twenty years!" Learning culture has created a mass movement. It is common for soldiers to automatically save pocket money to buy paper, pens, and books. Soldiers in a certain division automatically quit smoking and subscribed to the People's Daily. Soldiers in a certain field artillery regiment collected money to buy 12 radios. Soldiers in a division of a certain army automatically bought 7,000 fountain pens. Now, soldiers are calling for popular reading materials. The "Comrade-in-Arms" published by the Political Department of the North China Military Region is warmly welcomed by soldiers. Every "Comrade-in-Arms" has been thumbed through by soldiers. Although each issue has been distributed to 24,000 copies, the troops still demand an increase. (Zheng)

    华北解放军文化学习成热潮
    文盲正被迅速扫除
    一般指战员已识字二百以上
    【本报讯】数十万华北解放军已卷入一个学习文化的热潮，干部战士的文化水平，相当普遍地提高了一步。指战员绝大部分出身于劳动人民，以往被国民党的恶政和罪恶的社会制度，剥夺了受教育的权利，文化水平是很低的。十几年来，华北解放军像其他解放军一样，虽然极端重视自己的文化教育工作，但在紧张频繁的战争中，实际上没有可能按步就班地进行。华北区解放战争结束以后，华北解放军即进入相对和平环境下的正规训练。解放军内的广大指战员，对学习文化的要求非常迫切，这种情绪又随着胜利形势和部队需要而日益增涨。很多干部要求提高文化，使自己能够学习理论，整理经验。战士们要求识字念书。因此领导上在指示中即将文化学习放到很重要的位置，占到全部正规训练时间的十分之三。并提出“变华北解放军为军事、政治、文化巨大学校”，“有步骤地消灭文盲”的口号。把在职干部与战士，分别程度一律编入各个文化学习班次，文化程度相当于初小的，编成初级班，学习初小课程；文化程度相当于高小的，编成中级班，学习初级中学课程；初小程度以下的，编成识字班。解决了教材、教员的困难，制订了文化学习的各种教学制度。几个月来，华北解放军就以这些具体工作，迎接和组织了部队学习文化的高潮。这种教育现在在文化学习上已获得良好成绩，尤以消灭文盲的成绩最为显著。据调查，华北解放军各战斗部队二百字以下的文盲，已只剩少数。某某两个师已彻底消灭了二百字以下的文盲。某师每个战士在四个月内平均识字二一八字。某连在练兵前，识字五十个以下的有八十人，现在除六个人外都识字三百个以上。某团在练兵前，有七十七个战士能写简单书信，现在已增到二八七人。某师副师长李德才为大渡河十八勇士之一，打仗很好，过去不爱学习，战争时期，挂包里只带纸烟，不带文件。这次练兵中，每天晚上请警卫员给自己读报，一天做的事总在本本上写，写不上来查字典。经三个月学习，已能写一般通讯、报告。他说：“这次练兵，比以前二十年的文化学习进步还快呢！”学习文化已造成一种广大群众性的运动。战士们自动节省零钱买纸买笔买书的现象很普遍。某师战士自动戒烟订阅人民日报。某野炮团战士自己集款买收音机十二架。某军一个师战士自动买水笔者达七千人。现在，战士要求通俗读物的呼声很高。华北军区政治部出版的《战友》受到战士热烈欢迎，每本《战友》都被战士的手翻烂了，虽然每期已发行到二万四千本，但各部队仍要求增加。（正）
