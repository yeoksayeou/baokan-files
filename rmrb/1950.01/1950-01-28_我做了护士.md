I became a nurse.
　　
　　One day, I was giving a patient medicine, and she accidentally spilled the water. I snapped irritably, "You grabbed it before I told you to! Look, you've spilled water all over the bed!"
　　
　　"Oh, oh," the patient muttered apologetically and fearfully. Seeing her expression, a wave of sadness washed over me, and I ran back to the break room.
　　
　　This inpatient had traveled hundreds of miles from her rural village to Beijing for treatment. She suffered from severe trachoma, both eyes were bandaged, and the wound from her recent surgery was still causing her pain. Yet, instead of comforting her and taking good care of her, I snapped at her. I also remembered her saying, "I've suffered from eye disease for over a decade. If it weren't for the Communist Party liberating us, I would have just waited to go blind. This time, I hope my eyes can be cured so I can farm well and produce more grain to support the front lines. Once we eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, life will be better." Every word of these statements now whipped at me. What is my responsibility to a working person who has lost their health? I should be filled with deep class love, cherish them as I cherish my own eyes, demonstrate a high level of new morality, complete my mission, and be a nurse of the people! Clearly, I failed to do this, and it shows how seriously the view of looking down on the working people still exists in my mind.
　　
　　Therefore, from that day on, this eye patient became my dear friend. I tried my best to take care of her meticulously, reducing her suffering during her illness. Gradually, a close bond began to grow between us.

    我做了护士
    我做了护士。
    这一天，我给一个病人吃药，她一不小心，把水洒了。我暴躁地嚷道：“还没说让你拿你就拿！瞧，洒了一床水！”
    “哎，哎。”病人抱歉地、惶恐地嗫嚅着。看到她这种表情，一阵难过侵袭着我，我跑回休息室。
    这位临床的病人，是从几百里地的乡村，来京治病的贫苦农民。她害了重沙眼、两眼都裹了绷带，刚刚动手术后的伤口，还在痛苦着她。而我却不但不能好好地安慰她，照顾她，反而向她发脾气。我又记起了她曾经说：“我害了十几年的眼病，要不是共产党解放了我们，只有等着瞎了。这回我盼望治好我的眼，能够好好种地，多打粮食支援前线。消灭了蒋匪军，往后的日子就好过了。”这些话的每个字，如今都在鞭打着我。对于一个失去健康的劳动人民，我的责任是什么呢？我应该满怀着深挚的阶级的友爱，像爱护自己的眼珠一样，爱护着他，表现出高度的新的道德品质，完成我的任务，做一个人民的护士！显然，我却没有做到这一点，而表现着在我的思想中尚如何严重地存在着轻视劳动人民的观点。
    因此，从那天后这个治眼的病人，便成了我的亲切的友人。我尽力细心地照看着她，减少了她病中的苦痛。渐渐地，在我们之间，开始生长了一种亲密的感情。
