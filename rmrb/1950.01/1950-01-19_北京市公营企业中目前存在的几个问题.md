Several Problems Currently Existing in Beijing's Public Enterprises

	I. Democratic Management

After taking over various factories and mines, the leadership proposed relying on the working class to restore and develop production. Ten months of experience have shown that units that have done a good job in uniting and educating employees have achieved significant results. However, the following problems still exist in organizational leadership and the ideological style of cadres.

	1. Leading cadres are not good at widely soliciting opinions from employees on everything, so that not all employees have been fully mobilized. The bureaucracy of some leading cadres seriously hinders the high degree of enthusiasm and creativity of employees. Bureaucracy is manifested in two ways: one is that the work is not in-depth, and they fail to actively learn in new things; the other is that they do things based on experience, and they do not deeply understand the benefits of the democratic movement.
	2. In the early stage of democratic management, democratic management was only regarded as a simple political work of mobilizing employees to criticize the leadership and improve the leadership. It was not fully recognized that the main task was to mobilize employees to actively participate in the work of restoring and developing production, gradually establishing and improving various production systems, and rewarding model workers and rationalization proposals.
	3. To run people's enterprises well, leading cadres must be good at discovering activists and cultivating backbones. The Party, government, and labor union must exchange information in a timely manner and keep pace with each other, mobilizing all employees to carry out rationalization proposals in all aspects of work, technology, and systems.

	II. Cost Accounting

Cost accounting has been established in some units such as Yanjing Paper Mill, Qinghe Woolen Mill, Water Company, and Jingxi Coal Mine, but it is not very precise. Other units either only have monetary cost accounting after production, or even have no monetary costs at all. The existing experience in this area is as follows:

	1. Because most units lack scientific production plans and detailed records of raw materials and production processes, true costs are not easy to calculate. Therefore, to establish strict cost accounting, it is necessary to first establish and improve production systems, standards, and specifications.
	2. The cost accounting department has not yet been established in most units. Commercial accounting and cost accounting are mixed together, and there is a lack of cost accounting personnel. Therefore, although the establishment of strict cost accounting was proposed very early, it cannot be fully realized quickly.
	3. The fixed assets of individual units have not yet been finalized. Some have been determined, but new additions are not included. Therefore, depreciation is very unscientific and not detailed.
	4. According to the experience of formulating the 1950 production plan, it is difficult for units without cost accounting or inaccurate cost accounting to specifically stipulate, increase, or decrease what should be done in the 1950 operation. This shows that cost accounting is an important key in the economic accounting system, and also shows that without true cost accounting, it is impossible to achieve capital accumulation and planned production.

	III. Improving Quality and Reducing Costs

Improving quality and reducing costs is centered on the issue of enterprise management. This is the resolution of the August People's Representative Conference. In the initial takeover, emphasis was placed on restoring production and improving work efficiency. The quantity of production has increased greatly, but the quality has not been improved enough. Later, the proposal to improve quality and reduce costs gradually reversed the situation.

According to the experience of the past few months, to achieve this goal, we must start from many aspects and overcome the chaotic phenomenon of no system and no standards during the Kuomintang period.

	1. Launch a conservation movement: After the takeover, the initial management of equipment and the waste of raw materials in various units were quite serious. Broken equipment in the courtyard was exposed to the wind and rain. The items in the warehouse were not sorted out in time, and rotten and moldy things were everywhere. The waste of raw materials, coal, and electricity in production was not strictly reformed. Therefore, it was proposed at that time to thoroughly reform from saving manpower, saving financial resources, and saving raw materials to achieve the goal of reducing costs first from savings. This work has achieved great results, but waste is still quite common in some units and needs to be overcome urgently.
	2. Production standards and specifications: To improve quality, past standards and specifications must be reviewed. During the Kuomintang period, the machine efficiency of each unit was not clearly defined, workers' production had no quotas or standards, and finished products had no fixed specifications, so there was no basis for improving quality. Although this problem has been initially resolved in Qinghe Woolen Mill, Yanjing Paper Mill, Tram Company, Jingxi Coal Mine, Glass Factory, and Water Company, it has not achieved the desired results because the production records of some units are not sound. Further mobilization of employees to establish a scientific production system is still needed to solve the problem.
	3. Establish a strict responsibility system: In many units left by the Kuomintang, precise scientific division of labor and strict responsibility systems cannot be found at all. Equipment is allowed to be lost, machines are not managed by special personnel, tools are taken and used indiscriminately, and there are no standards or specifications for how much is produced and how good or bad it is, nor are there records and statistics. Those who produce well are not rewarded, and those who are not diligent are not criticized. After the takeover, the factories began to establish a responsibility system, but due to the short time, the division of labor was not scientific enough, and there was still a lack of a series of new systems, regulations, and clear procedures.

According to the experience of the past few months, to improve quality and reduce costs, on the one hand, we must strictly carry out universal savings, and on the other hand, we must establish and improve various production systems to achieve full utilization of human resources, materials, and machines.

	IV. Work Plan

Although a full-year production plan was drafted after the takeover, the plan was not specific enough and lacked detailed monthly plans and specific plans for each production team and individual due to the lack of precise cost accounting and detailed raw material and production diaries.

According to existing experience, to run people's enterprises well and put them on the right track quickly, on the one hand, we must rely more closely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses in terms of cadre ideology and improve our technical level; on the other hand, we must further strictly implement the economic accounting system from the work of production standards, production systems, cost accounting, precise planning, and salary adjustments, increase production and quality, and reduce costs, so that people's enterprises can be restored and developed rapidly in a more planned and step-by-step manner.

    北京市公营企业中目前存在的几个问题
          一、民主管理
    各厂矿接管后，领导上即提出依靠工人阶级恢复与发展生产，十个月的经验证明，凡是对职工团结教育好的单位，都收到较大的成绩，但在组织领导和干部思想作风上仍存在以下问题。
    １、领导干部还不善于事事广泛征求职工意见，以致没有将所有职工充分动员起来，某些领导干部的官僚主义还严重的障碍着高度发挥职工的积极性与创造性。官僚主义的表现，一种是工作不够深入，未能积极地在新的事物中学习；一种是凭经验做事，未深刻认识民主运动的好处。
    ２民主管理初期，把民主管理只当成是发动职工批评领导，改进领导的单纯政治工作，没有充分认识主要是发动职工积极参加恢复与发展生产的工作，逐步建立与健全各种生产制度，奖励工作模范和合理化建议。
    ３要想搞好人民企业，领导干部必须善于发现积极分子培养骨干，党、政、工三方面须及时交流情况，步调一致，发动所有职工在工作中、技术上、制度上各方面开展合理化的建议。
            二、成本计算
    成本计算在燕京造纸厂、清河制呢厂、自来水公司和京西煤矿等一些单位已建立了，但还不十分精确。其他单位则有的只有生产后的货币成本计算，有的甚至连货币成本也没有，这方面现有的经验如下：
    １、因为大多数单位缺乏科学的生产计划和原材料、生产过程的详细记载，所以真正的成本就不易计算出来。因此要建立严格的成本计算，就必须首先建立与健全生产制度、标准及规格。
    ２、大部单位成本会计还没建立起来，商业会计和成本会计混在一起，成本会计的人材也较缺乏，因之虽然很早就提出建立严格的成本会计，却不能迅速全部实现。
    ３、个别单位固定资产还没有最后确定，有的虽已确定，但对新添设置则没计算在内。因之折旧很不科学，不详细。
    ４、根据制定一九五○年生产计划的经验，没有成本会计或成本计算不精确的单位，很难肯定一九五○年经营中应具体的规定什么，提高多少，或减低多少。这说明成本会计是经济核算制中的重要关键，也说明没有真正的成本计算，就不能达到积累资本和计划生产。
            三、提高质量减低成本
    提高质量减低成本，中心是企业化的经营问题。这是八月各界人民代表会议的决议。在初期接管时，着重了恢复生产，提高工作效率，生产数量有很大的增加，但质量提高不够，后来提出提高质量、减低成本，才逐渐扭转局面。
    根据几个月来的经验，要想达到这一目的，必须从多方面着手，克服国民党时期无制度、无标准的混乱现象。
    １、开展节约运动：接管后，各单位最初对器材的保管、原材料的浪费是相当严重的。院里的破烂器材任其风吹雨洒。仓库的存物没有及时整理，腐烂霉锈的东西到处都有，生产中的原材料和煤电等浪费，也未加严格改革，因此在当时提出从人力节约、财力节约、原材料节约，来彻底改革，以达到先从节约上减低成本。这一工作已有很大成绩，但有的单位浪费现象也还相当多，急待克服。
    ２、生产标准与规格：要提高质量，就必须审查过去的标准与规格。在国民党时期，各单位机器效能没有明确规定，工人生产没有定额和标准，成品没有一定的规格，提高质量就无所依据。这一问题虽在清河制呢厂、燕京造纸厂、电车公司、京西煤矿、玻璃厂、自来水公司初步解决了，但因为有的单位生产日录不健全，仍未能收到应有的成绩。尚须进一步发动职工建立科学生产制度来解决。
    ３、建立严格的责任制：国民党遗留的许多单位中，根本就找不到精密的科学分工和严格的责任制，器材任其损失、机器没专人保管、工具是乱拿乱用，生产多少和好坏既没标准和规格，又没纪录和统计，生产好的得不到奖励，不尽职的没有批评。接管以后，各厂开始建立责任制，但由于时间短，分工还不够科学，还缺乏一系列的新制度、章则及手续的明确规定。
    根据几个月的经验，要想提高质量，减低成本，一方面是严格进行普遍的节约，另一方面要建立与健全各种生产制度，达到全面的人尽其力，物尽其用，机器尽其效能。
            四、工作计划
    接管后虽拟了全年生产计划，但由于没有精确的成本计算，同时原材料及生产日记不详细，以致计划不够具体缺乏每月的详细计划和每个生产小组以及个人的具体计划。
    根据已有的经验，要搞好人民企业，使企业迅速走上正轨，今后一方面从干部思想上更要紧紧的依靠群众的积极性，创造性，提高自己的技术水平；另一方面必须从生产标准、生产制度、成本会计、精密计划、调整工资等工作中进一步的严格经济核算制，提高产量、质量，减低成本，使人民企业更有计划有步骤的迅速恢复与发展。
                                                    （良）
