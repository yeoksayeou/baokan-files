    Andong Paper Mill Closely Cooperates in the New Record Movement between Party, Government, Labor Union, and Youth League to Create New Leadership Methods and Exceed the Annual Production Task

    [Reported by this newspaper] In the New Record Movement, the state-owned Andong Paper Mill in Liaodong Province saw close cooperation and coordinated action between the factory's CCP General Branch, administration, labor union, and Youth League organizations. This created new leadership and working methods, enabling the widespread development of the New Record Movement and greatly increasing labor productivity. In 1949, the mill exceeded its annual production task by 14% and reduced costs by 14.4 billion Northeast Yuan.

    The main experiences of the factory in implementing the new leadership methods are as follows:

            New Methods of Propaganda and Mobilization: Reporting Good News, Congratulations, Broadcasting, and Celebrations

    (1) Carry out diverse propaganda and mobilization work fully, tailored to the specific situation of the factory. The factory utilized nine types of propaganda and mobilization methods, all of which yielded good results: (1) Good News Reports and Quick Reports. As soon as a new record was achieved, the labor union would write the achievement, the methods used, and the name of the creator on a propaganda board in red chalk, and then write it on red paper, which was distributed to each factory and workshop. Upon receiving the report, each factory would immediately write it on blackboards and propaganda boards, and Party and mass cadres would go to the workshops to spread the news orally, boosting the morale of the workers in each factory and rapidly expanding the movement from individual points to the entire surface. (2) Congratulations and Congratulatory Letters. This was the best way to encourage the creators of new records and strengthen the connection between leading cadres and production advanced workers. After the 88-inch paper machine created a new record on November 10th last year, the labor union director immediately wrote a letter to congratulate them. The workers were encouraged by the letter and unanimously expressed their determination to create new records again. Another approach was for the labor union director and branch secretary to go to the site to offer congratulations, which the workers felt honored by. (3) Broadcasting. Each branch factory was equipped with a small broadcasting system, and each studio had a loudspeaker. Whenever a new record was achieved, it was broadcasted at any time to ensure that even illiterate workers could quickly learn about it. (4) Notices and Appeals. For example, the General Branch, Labor Union, and Youth League jointly issued an appeal to complete tasks ahead of schedule to celebrate Stalin's 70th birthday, which proved to be very effective. (5) Party members and Youth League members are used to carry out propaganda and mobilization at any time; The Wood Digester Branch has the best results. After the first award ceremony, Nie Zhongyi, a technical worker in the Wood Digester Branch, complained: "I work the same as everyone else, but the prize goes to others. From now on, let the prize winners do the work!" When Song Zhenren (branch secretary) heard this, he immediately said to Nie Zhongyi: "Lao Nie, this award is for eight months, and we haven't made any special contributions, so of course we can't win the prize. Didn't the factory director say that there will be awards every month from now on? Show your skills and come up with ideas to try to win the prize next time." After hearing Song Zhenren's words, Nie Zhongyi went on to create the first new record for shortening the cooking time. In addition, the factory also used publicizing the production achievements of the day, sounding whistles and raising flags to celebrate the early completion of tasks, reporting good news to the leaders, and publicizing the leaders' congratulatory letters, combining these diverse methods of propaganda and mobilization, and the effect was very good.

            Initiate the Signing of Collective Contracts: Party and League Members Take the Lead in Implementation

    (2) In order to further promote the New Record Movement and ensure the successful completion of production tasks, workshop linkage contracts and collective contracts were signed. By signing contracts, the content of Party and mass work was enriched, and it was clarified how Party and mass work should cooperate with production to guarantee and supervise production.

    Under the instructions of the higher authorities and inspired by the experience of advanced factories, the General Branch decided to carry out linkage contracts and mentoring contracts, and on the basis of linkage contracts and mentoring contracts, the labor union and the administration signed collective contracts. In the implementation process, the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League divided their work as follows: first, the Party and the Youth League conducted ideological education within each system, so that Party members and League members first understood the significance of signing contracts, and then the labor union came forward to call for signing contracts, and Party members and League members took the lead in responding and widely publicized in the workshops. In the process of signing linkage contracts, the responsibility of administrative cadres was to help each workshop accurately determine the content of the contract. When signing collective contracts, the administration formulated production plans and reward measures, as well as items related to workers' welfare. The labor union then organized workers to repeatedly discuss and propose how to ensure the completion of the plan, and then combined them into articles. After the contract was signed, the Party and the League respectively conducted education, calling on Party members and League members to earnestly implement the contract. To achieve this goal, they also called on Party members and League members to take the lead in making individual plans. In short, in this process, the work of the Party, the labor union, and the Youth League all revolved around this center. The facts of the past month have proved that this approach has overcome the phenomenon of stopping work to wait for materials, coordinated the production of each workshop, strengthened the workers' sense of responsibility, and embodied the role of guaranteeing and supervising production; at the same time, it enriched the content of Party and mass work, and under the unified leadership of the Party, they were closely combined in production.

            Combining the New Record Movement to Create New Ways of Building the Party

    (3) Combining the New Record Movement, new ways of building the Party were created, so that the Party organization developed with the development of the production movement. In October last year, in order to carry out the New Record Movement, 445 advanced production workers who had emerged in one year were rewarded, including 97 Party members, accounting for 41% of all Party members in the factory. The General Branch seized this achievement, publicized the pioneering role of Party members in production, and expanded the influence of the Party; at the same time, it studied the 348 non-Party members who received awards and decided to absorb a group of new Party members from them. After understanding through the mass evaluation process, the General Branch specifically assigned the development targets to the branch. As a result, except for two workers in the Electrical Room who were not developed due to their lower awareness, the remaining 22 were approved and announced at the award ceremony.

    Since the objects absorbed were all advanced producers and were announced and approved at the award ceremony, it gave the masses great education and stimulation. After the meeting, the masses expressed that they would strive to join the Party by creating new records. On the other hand, it also educated Party members, making them aware that they should become advanced producers, thereby improving the level of the Party. This method not only overcomes the tedious bias of simply holding meetings for public discussion, but also overcomes the shortcomings of weak organizational strength in important production departments due to attention to the combination of Party building and production. Among the 22 Party members developed this time, 6 are from the Power Division, and others, such as papermaking, fine selection, and wood cutting, also have one to two members, and most of them are technical workers and skilled workers, which directly promoted production. At the same time, through these Party members, the Party's leading role in the production process can be strengthened.

            Daily Organizational and Educational Work Closely Combined with the Movement

    (4) With the development of the New Record Movement, the leadership methods were improved, and the daily work was improved. In the past, regardless of the labor emulation, checking waste, and this New Record Movement, in the democratic evaluation of past advanced producers, whenever a movement came, the upper and lower levels were in a flurry of activity and spent the whole day in meetings. Workers' technical and cultural education, Party and League members' education, and even the regular meetings in the Party, the labor union and the League had been canceled in an invisible way; after the movement was over, it was difficult to reorganize the daily organizational life and education with the central movement. At the beginning of this New Record Movement, the leading cadres grasped the spirit that the New Record Movement was not a temporary shock movement and emphasized the combination of daily organizational work, education work, and the New Record Movement. In addition, the Party, the government, the labor union, and the Youth League had the same goals and implemented collective office work, which not only unified the leadership of the factory's Party and mass work, but also particularly facilitated the coordination and contact in daily work. Secondly, the meeting budget system was implemented, reducing unnecessary meetings, and the dates, content, and time of the regular meetings of the Party, the government, the labor union, and the Youth League were stipulated. In this way, ordinary workers only attend three meetings a month, and Party members and League members generally attend five meetings, and at most seven meetings. In addition, based on the principle of voluntariness, workshops were used as the main body to organize various learning groups focusing on technical education combined with cultural education (day classes in three shifts, learning for one hour after work from Monday to Thursday, and an average worker can learn three times a month), and it was stipulated that political education should be carried out mainly by Party members (Party classes on Fridays during the day shift), strengthening the activities of the club, so that the various daily activities in this New Record Movement were not only not collapsed, but became normal.

    安东造纸厂在新纪录运动中党政工团密切配合
    创造新的领导方法、超过全年生产任务
    【本报讯】辽东省国营安东造纸厂在创造新纪录运动中，厂内中共总支、行政、工会和青年团组织密切配合，协同动作，创造了新的领导方法和工作方法，使新纪录运动普遍开展，劳动生产率大大提高。一九四九年超过全年生产任务百分之十四，降低成本一百四十四亿元（东北券）。
    该厂实行新的领导方法中，主要经验有下列四点：
            新的宣传鼓动方法  报喜道贺广播庆祝
    （一）针对本厂具体情况，充分进行多种多样的宣传鼓动工作。该厂运用的宣传鼓动方式，共有九种，收效都好：（１）喜报与快报。一有了新纪录，工会即将其事迹、创造的方法及创造者的名字，用红色粉笔写在宣传牌上，再写到红纸上，分送各厂及车间。各厂接到后，立即写到黑板和宣传牌上，党群干部并到车间进行口头传播，鼓动了各厂工人情绪，使运动迅速由点到面的扩展起来。（２）贺喜与贺喜信。这是鼓动创造新纪录的本人，并加强领导干部与生产先进者联系的最好方式。去年十一月十日，八十八英寸抄纸机创造了新纪录后，工会主任马上写信去祝贺，工友们接信后，鼓舞了信心，一致表示再创新纪录。另一种方式是工会主任、支部书记到现场贺喜，工友们都感到荣誉。（３）广播。各分厂都按装了小型广播机，每个工作室有收音喇叭，当每个新纪录出现之后，都随时广播宣传，使不识字的工友也能迅速的知道。（４）通告号召。如为庆祝斯大林七十寿辰，总支工会青年团联合发出提前完成任务的号召，就收到很大成效。（５）通过党员团员，随时进行宣传鼓动；成绩最好的是木釜室支部。当第一次发奖大会后，木釜室技术工人聂忠义发怨言说：“干活一样干，奖是别人的，以后让得奖的人干吧！”宋振仁（支部书记）听到后，立即向聂忠义说：“老聂，这次奖是八个月的，我们又没有什么特殊功劳，当然不能得奖。厂长不是讲了吗，以后每月都奖，有本事往外拿吧，使一把劲，想出办法，争取下次得奖。”聂忠义听了宋振仁的话，结果创造了缩短蒸煮时间的第一个新纪录。此外，还有公布当天生产成绩，鸣笛升旗庆祝提前完成任务，向首长报喜，公布首长贺信等等宣传鼓动方式，互相结合，效果都很好。
            发动订集体合同  党团员带头执行
    （二）为使新纪录运动推进一步，保证生产任务胜利完成，订立了车间联系合同与集体合同，通过订合同，又充实了党群工作的内容，明确了党群工作应如何配合生产，保证和监督生产。
    在上级指示与先进厂的经验启发下，总支决定开展联系合同与师徒合同，在联系合同与师徒合同的基础上，由工会与行政订立集体合同。在执行中，党政工团这样分了工：首先由党与青年团，按各系统进行思想教育，使党团员首先明白订合同的意义，然后由工会出面号召订合同，党团员带头响应，并在车间广泛宣传。在订立联系合同中，行政干部的责任是：帮助各个车间，恰当的确定合同内容。订集体合同时，行政制订生产计划与奖励办法，以及有关工人的福利事业等项。工会则组织工人反复讨论，提出如何保证计划的完成，然后结合起来制成条文。合同订立后，党与团即分别进行教育，号召党团员认真执行合同。为达此目的，又号召党团员带头订个人计划。总之，在这个过程中，党工团的工作，都围绕着这个中心。一个月来的事实证明，这样做就克服了停工待料现象，使各车间生产衔接，加强了工人的责任心，体现了保证与监督生产的作用；同时又充实了党群工作的内容，在党的统一领导下，相互在生产上密切结合。
            结合新纪录运动  创造建党新方式
    （三）结合新纪录运动，创造了建党新方式，使党的组织随着生产运动的发展而发展。去年十月间，为开展新纪录运动，曾奖励了一年中涌现的四百四十五名生产先进分子，其中有党员九十七名，占全厂党员的百分之四十一。总支抓住了这个成绩，宣传党员在生产中的先锋作用，扩大党的影响；同时，又研究了三百四十八名受奖的非党员，决定从中吸收一批新党员。经过群众评功过程了解，总支就把发展的对象具体的布置到支部。结果，除电气室两名工友因觉悟较低没有发展外，其余二十二名皆被批准，并在发奖大会上公布了。
    由于被吸收的对象都是先进生产者，且在发奖大会上宣布批准，给群众很大教育和刺激。会后，群众纷纷表示，要以创造新纪录来争取入党。另一方面又教育了党员，使他们知道自己应当成为先进生产者，从而提高了党的水平。这种方式，不仅克服了单纯开会公议的烦琐偏向，并且由于注意了建党与生产结合，也克服了重要生产部门组织力量薄弱的缺点。这次发展的二十二名党员中，就有六名是动力股的，其他如抄纸、精选、削木等也都有一名到两名，且多数为技术工与熟练工，这就直接推动了生产，同时，通过这些党员，就可以加强党在生产过程中的领导作用。
            日常组织教育工作  紧紧结合运动进行
    （四）随着新纪录运动的展开，改进了领导方法，健全了日常工作。过去不管在立功竞赛、检查浪费以及这次新纪录运动，奖励已往先进生产者的民主评功中，总是运动来了，上下手忙脚乱的整天在开会，关于工人的技术文化教育、党团员教育，甚至党工团的组织生活中的例会也无形中取消了；运动过去之后，又从新来整理日常的组织生活与教育，总是很难与中心运动相结合。这次新纪录运动开始之初，领导干部即掌握了新纪录运动不是一时的突击运动的精神，强调了日常组织工作、教育工作与新纪录运动相结合，加以党政工团目标一致，实行了集体办公，不仅使工厂党群工作原则的统一领导，也特别便利了日常工作中的配合联系。其次是实行了会议预算制度，减少了不必要的会议，规定了党政工团的例会日期与会议内容及时间，这样普通工人每月只开三次会，党团员一般的是五次最多的是七次。此外，并根据自愿原则，以车间为主，组织了以技术教育为主结合文化教育的各种学习小组（三班制的白天班，每星期一至四下班后学习一小时，平均一个工人一月能学三次），规定了以党员为主进行政治教育（白天班星期五上党课），加强了俱乐部的活动，因而这次新纪录运动中的日常各种活动，不仅没有垮台，反而正常起来。
