Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 6th: TASS Vienna, January 5th: The Vienna Abendpost published a letter written by Kent, a well-known Viennese doctor, who served for a long time in China as a senior doctor for the Red Cross and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. His letter states: "One morning in December 1941, a Japanese fighter plane circled over the undefended city of Changde - the rice market in Central China - and flew low, dropping small packages containing cotton, wool and rice. Initially, no one paid particular attention to this, but after a period of time, several residents of Changde suddenly died from a severe infectious disease. Later, many more people became ill. At that time, I was the president of the Red Cross in the province where Changde was located (referring to Hunan Province). After examining the corpses, we confirmed that the source of the disease was plague.

    Shortly thereafter, a plague epidemic broke out in the province. We concluded that the spread of the infectious disease was related to the Japanese air raid. Based on microscopic examination of the rice grains dropped from the plane, we similarly discovered plague bacteria. Thanks to the emergency measures we took to combat the infectious disease (through quarantine and the elimination of rats), we were able to prevent the spread of the infectious disease and save some of the patients; several hundred people fell ill. However, the infectious bacteria were not eradicated until the city was burned down in the war two years later.

    At the time, I immediately reported the barbaric actions of the Japanese to the relevant authorities in Chongqing and Britain. To my surprise, no one paid any attention to this. The government did not focus on the fact that this crime was a clear violation of international law.

    Therefore, it is all the more important that the Khabarovsk trial exposed the criminals' offense and confirmed the correctness of the conclusions I had already made."

    Kent concluded: "All friends of peace must recognize the possibility of bacteriological warfare occurring in the future. Only through an irreconcilable struggle against the warmongers can mankind be freed from new and endless suffering."

    奥国医生肯特证明
    日寇曾在常德使用细菌武器
    【新华社北京六日电】塔斯社维也纳五日讯：维也纳晚报刊载维也纳著名医生肯特所写的一封信，肯特曾在中国任过长时期的红十字会和联合国善后救济总署的高级医生。他的信写道：“一九四一年十二月的一个早晨，一架日本战斗机盘旋在没有防御的常德城——华中米市的上空，并低飞投下若干装有棉花、羊毛和米的小包。最初没有人特别注意此事，但是，过了一个时期，常德几名居民突然因得严重的传染病而死去。后来接着又有许多人患病。那时，我是常德所在的那个省（按指湖南省）的红十字会会长。经检验尸体，我们证实病源是鼠疫。
    此后不久，该省爆发了鼠疫病。我们得到结论：传染病的蔓延与日本的空袭有某些关系。根据显微镜检查自飞机投下的米粒，我们同样地发现了鼠疫菌。由于我们采取了紧急措施来打击传染病（通过检疫隔离和消灭老鼠），我们得以防止传染病的蔓延，并挽救了一部分病人，得病的人有好几百名。但是，传染病菌直到两年后该城在战争中被火烧以后，才被根除。
    当时我曾立即向重庆的和英国的有关当局报告日本人的野蛮行动。使我惊讶的是，没有任何人对此予以注意。政府并不注重这种罪恶是显然违背国际法的行为。
    因此，伯力审判揭穿了罪犯这种进攻的罪状并证实我已经作出的结论的正确，就更形重要了。”
    肯特最后指出：“一切和平的友人们，必须认识到细菌战在将来也有发生的可能。唯有对战争贩子进行不调和的斗争，才能自新的无穷痛苦中解救人类。”
