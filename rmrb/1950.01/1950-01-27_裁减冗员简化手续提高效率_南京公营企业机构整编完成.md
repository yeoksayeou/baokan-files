    Streamlining Staff, Simplifying Procedures, and Improving Efficiency:
    Nanjing Public Enterprise Organization Completed Reorganization
    The public enterprises in Nanjing have undergone reorganization, eliminating the previous phenomenon of bloated organizations and excessive staffing, providing favorable conditions for the smooth recovery and sound development of production. This reorganization began in the winter of last year, lasting about two months, and involved 21 units affiliated with or managed by the Construction Bureau. Before the liberation of Nanjing, these enterprises were all owned by Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, and were characterized by overlapping organizations and numerous redundant personnel, resulting in unclear division of labor and extremely low work efficiency. In Nanjing Radio Factory's six production groups, each group had separate tool rooms and instrument rooms. At the Wired Radio Factory, a finished product had to go through seven procedures from the production department to the sales department; the factory's (including the company) staff accounted for 37 percent of the total number of employees, while laborers accounted for 12 percent. The deputy chief engineer of the Nanjing Power Plant did not know the power plant's operations and only did newspaper clipping work every day. This phenomenon had long aroused dissatisfaction among the workers. Due to the unsoundness of the enterprises themselves, most of them suffered losses. The Nanjing Power Plant lost more than 560 million yuan in less than half a year after liberation.
            Redundant Personnel Introduced to Other Jobs or Study Opportunities
    After this reorganization, the appearance of each unit has greatly changed. According to statistics from 16 units, a total of 445 redundant personnel were laid off, and the laid-off personnel have been introduced to other jobs or given study opportunities. At the same time, talented and hardworking personnel have been promoted to enrich the leadership structure. The organizational structure of each unit has also been adjusted. For example, the repair shop and registration section of the Telecommunications Bureau, and the general affairs section and secretarial office of the Power Plant, which had overlapping functions, have been merged into one organization. The separate tool rooms, instrument rooms, and material rooms of the six production organizations of the Radio Factory have been appropriately centralized into one management organization. After this reorganization, the organizational structure of each unit has been changed from a three-level system to a two-level system, reducing complicated procedures in the production and sales departments. Technical research offices have also been established in some factories. At the same time, the reorganization has also changed the monopolistic style of some military representatives, clearly defined the responsibilities of each person, studied labor discipline, and strictly enforced the financial revenue and expenditure system.
    This reorganization went through many twists and turns. At the beginning, people generally had many concerns about the reorganization work. In the large-scale and populous Telecommunications Bureau and Power Plant, everyone was afraid of being laid off. In workshop-style factories such as the Nanjing Municipal Henghe Oil Factory and Coal Ball Factory, because raw materials were relatively cheap and sales were not a problem, everyone generally thought that there was no need for reorganization. Some employees were worried about their lives after being laid off because of their poor abilities or poor work attitude. These concerns and incorrect ideas were gradually eliminated after studying the "Six Major Tasks" proposed by the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee to break the enemy's blockade, and after the Director of the Construction Bureau made a report, clarifying for whom to reorganize, who would reorganize, and how to reorganize.
            Rely on Workers to Conduct Democratic Discussions and Formulate Draft Establishment Plans
    The second problem in the reorganization was how to conduct democratic discussions and formulate draft establishment plans. To this end, many factories launched business studies. For example, the Wired Radio Factory systematically required each department to report to all employees on its business scope, work system, and personnel division, so that each department could understand each other. At the same time, the factory's income and expenditure situation was announced, so that everyone could recognize the difficulties and discuss the establishment from the perspective of maintaining self-sufficiency and developing production. Therefore, most of the democratically formulated draft establishment plans were relatively reasonable. However, the leading cadres of some factories exaggerated the shortcomings of the employees and underestimated the workers' awareness, so they did not dare to rely on the workers to carry out the reorganization. For example, the Nanjing Brewing Factory did not take the business plan and establishment table to the workers for discussion, but decided on the establishment based only on the opinions of a few people. As a result, it could not be implemented. Later, under the assistance of the Construction Bureau, the factory's leaders corrected the above-mentioned shortcomings and advocated submitting the business plan and establishment table to the employees for democratic discussion and revision. Some factories were too hasty in determining the scope of business and did not give sufficient consideration to the actual performance of the machines and the supply of raw materials. For example, the Changjiang Rice Mill determined its establishment based on a plan to mill 10 million catties of brown rice per month. In fact, due to difficulties with raw materials and machinery, it could not reach the output of 10 million catties per month. After discovering this situation, the factory tightened its establishment and allocated manpower according to the actual situation, thus avoiding waste. Some units had a purely financial view of simply reducing personnel to reduce expenses, regardless of business development, but this bias has been timely corrected under the instructions of higher authorities.

### 裁减冗员简化手续提高效率  南京公营企业机构整编完成

    裁减冗员简化手续提高效率
    南京公营企业机构整编完成
    【新华社南京二十六日电】南京市的公营企业经过整编后，已经消除了原来机构臃肿冗员充斥的现象，对生产的顺利恢复和健全发展提供了良好的条件。这次整编在去年冬季开始，历时约两月，整编的企业有建设局所属或代管的二十一个单位。这些企业在南京解放前均属国民党官僚资本所有，一向是机构重叠，冗员众多，因而分工不明，工作效率极低。南京无线电厂的六个生产组，每组都单独设有工具间和仪器间。有线电厂一件成品由生产部门到营业部门，要经过七次手续；该厂（包括公司在内）职员占到总人数的百分之三十七，工役竟占到总人数的百分之十二。南京电厂的副总工程师，不知道电厂业务，每天只做些剪报工作。这种现象，很久就已经引起工人的不满。由于企业本身不健全，因此大多企业赔了本，南京电厂在解放后不到半年中，即亏损五亿六千多万元。
            被裁人员分别介绍其他工作或学习
    经过这次整编，各单位面貌已大为改变。据十六个单位统计，共裁减冗员四百四十五名，对被裁人员已分别介绍其他工作或给予学习机会。同时提拔了有才能并且努力工作的人员，充实了领导机构。各单位的组织机构亦进行了调整。如电信局的修配所和册报股、电厂的总务课和秘书室等重复单位，均裁并为一个组织。无线电厂六个生产组织各别的工具间、仪器间和材料间，都已适当地集中到一个管理组织中去。经过这次整编之后，各单位组织机构已由三级制变为两级制，减少了生产和营业部门中的繁复手续，在某些工厂中并成立了技术研究室。同时，整编中更转变了某些军事代表的包办代替作风，明确规定了每个人的职责，研究了劳动纪律，严格了财政收支制度。
    这次整编经过了许多曲折。开始时，一般人对整编工作都有许多顾虑。在规模大、人数多的电信局和电厂，大家害怕被裁。在南京市营恒和油厂和煤球厂等作坊性质的工厂中，因原料较便宜，销路无问题，一般都可以赚钱，所以大家又产生了无可整编的思想。部分的职员因自己能力较差或劳动态度不好，担心编余后的生活。这些顾虑和不正确思想，经过对中共中央华东局所提出的打破敌人封锁的“六大任务”的学习和建设局局长作了报告，明白了为谁整编，谁来整编，怎样整编的道理后，才逐渐被消除。
            依靠职工进行民主讨论制订编制草案
    整编中的第二个问题便是如何进行民主讨论，制订编制草案。为此，不少工厂展开了业务学习。例如有线电厂有组织有计划地要各部门向全体职工报告业务范围、工作制度和人员分工等情形，使各部门互相了解。同时公布了全厂收支情况，使大家认识困难，从保本自给发展生产的观点去讨论编制，因此大部分民主制订的编制草案，都是比较合理的。但是有些工厂的领导干部夸大了职工的缺点，过低估计了工人的觉悟程度，因而不敢依靠工人进行整编。如南京酿化厂即没有把业务计划和编制表拿到工人中去讨论，仅凭几个人的意见就决定了编制。结果无法执行。后来该厂领导人员在建设局的帮助下纠正了上述毛病，主张把业务计划和编制表交职工民主讨论和修正。有些工厂在确定业务范围时，过于粗率，对机器的实际性能和原料供应等各方面情况考虑不周。如长江碾米厂是依据每月碾糙米一千万斤的计划而确定编制的。事实上因原料与机器有困难，每月不能达到一千万斤的产量。该厂发现这种情况后，紧缩编制，按实际情况配置人力，才避免了浪费现象。有些单位则有只图缩减人员减轻开支的单纯财政观点，不顾及业务发展，但在上级指示下这个偏向也已经及时得到纠正。
