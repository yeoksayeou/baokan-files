    Answering Questions from the Civil Affairs Department of the Pingyuan Provincial Government Regarding Urban Housing Issues
    The Pingyuan Provincial People's Government Civil Affairs Department's questions of September 9, 1949, regarding urban real estate and housing issues, have been submitted to the relevant government departments for research. The replies are as follows:
    (1) The Civil Affairs Department of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government raised two situations, namely: 1. Public land with private houses, where the public land remains publicly owned; 2. Public land with private houses, but the public land has been transferred to private ownership, and the individuals have obtained red deeds from the old government as proof. We believe that the handling principles for these two situations should be: Regardless of which situation it is, the private ownership of the houses should first be recognized and protected. As for the land occupied by the houses, regardless of whether the public land has been transformed into private ownership, it should not be dealt with for the time being, and things should continue as they have been. If the government needs to requisition this land, appropriate compensation should be given based on the value of the private houses built on the land, and then it should be recovered or requisitioned. For houses of the same value, if the public land occupied by them has been transferred to private ownership, it may be appropriate to give a slightly higher compensation. Currently, cultivable vacant land still owned by the government should be rented to the masses for cultivation at low rents, except for those that must be retained. However, the ownership should still belong to the government, so that the land can be recovered at any time for future national construction or municipal construction needs. In the future, the government should formulate regulations to manage all public land. If private individuals want to build houses on public land, they must submit an application to the government for approval; otherwise, they will be dealt with as infringing on public property.
    (2) Landlords' properties in cities are very complex, and generally cannot be considered feudal property. Therefore, houses in cities, whether owned by urban landlords or rural landlords, must not be confiscated now. The properties of bureaucratic capitalists, counter-revolutionaries, or local bullies that have been confiscated by government decree shall be owned by the government and listed as public property, and should not be distributed. As for the parts they forcibly occupy from private individuals, the government may make a discretionary judgment and return them to the original owners.
    (3) Although guilds are feudal organizations, they often rely on guild property to have done or are doing some public welfare undertakings, which are welcomed by the masses and have some connection with certain groups of people. Their property should not be confiscated or taken over. If certain guilds have no one responsible for them or managing them, the government can come forward to take temporary custody, and then make a fundamental resolution based on the situation in the future. These guilds under government custody can be used by government agencies, organizations, and schools, but they should be responsible for protection and repair, and should not damage them. As for guilds with people managing them, the government should not take them over under the pretext of temporary custody. If government agencies, organizations, and schools really need to use them, they can negotiate with the guild managers for rent. The properties of general religious and superstitious organizations in cities (such as churches, temples, monasteries, etc.) should be protected and should not be confiscated. If a certain religious and superstitious organization engages in treasonous activities or counter-revolutionary conspiracies, and the government has verified the facts and explicitly banned them, its property can be confiscated by the government. However, a strict distinction must be made here between the actions of organizations and individuals. If only one or a few individuals are engaged in treasonous activities or counter-revolutionary conspiracies, and the entire organization is just a general religious and superstitious organization with no reactionary criminal behavior, then individual criminals should be punished, and the entire organization should not be banned casually, nor should the property of the organization be confiscated.
    (4) The government should protect church property and allow religious freedom for believers. Government agencies and troops must not occupy churches. If it is necessary to borrow church buildings, it must be negotiated with the church and their permission obtained. If church property has been left unattended, the government can take temporary custody, but it should be returned when the original custodian returns.
    Attached letter to the comrades of the People's Daily Editorial Department:
    After reading the Xinhua News Agency mailbox article "On the Nature and Policy of Urban Housing Rent" published in the Pingyuan Daily on August 30th, many confused ideas have been resolved in our minds. However, there are still several issues related to urban real estate that cannot be specifically resolved based on the principles or methods mentioned in the article. At the same time, these are issues that are often encountered in the current handling of urban real estate. We hereby raise them for your response:
    (1) Regarding the issue of "public land with private houses": The article mentions: "Because urban land has been leveled and reorganized, there is some investment in it, and it has been bought and sold several times, so the situation is relatively complex, and it has become an inseparable part of the real estate capital, which is different from rural land. Therefore, it should not be dealt with for the time being." This principle should be adopted for private real estate in cities, except for the real estate of bureaucratic capitalists and extremely heinous counter-revolutionaries. However, according to our investigation, the land situation in the Chengguan District of Liaocheng County, Pingyuan Province, is as follows: The land in Chengguan (within the city wall) has historically been public land, which has long been recognized by local residents. For example, in the past, the tax deeds only indicated the number of rooms of the house, without the length, width, dimensions, or acreage of the land. The government did not collect taxes or grain. Vacant land with income (such as reed pits, cultivated land, etc.) was leased by the old government. People built houses on the land, and the houses were privately owned and could be freely bought, sold, and transferred. The land could also be transferred, and there was a certain price for the transfer. However, this was a transfer of the right to use. If the government needed to use the land, it could be recovered without compensation. Similarly, since the land has always been state-owned, it should also be determined as state-owned in the future. However, because all the land in Chengguan is like this, the impact range is very large. Therefore, the land rights in Chengguan have not yet been determined. In another part of the city (such as Chaocheng, Yanggu, etc.), the remnants of "public land with private houses" still exist. For example, the red deeds in the past also did not have the dimensions or acreage of the land, and no taxes or grain were paid. However, a part of it was transformed into private ownership very early on. Therefore, some people have obtained red deeds from the old government, and the old government also paid a certain land price to purchase land in the past. The concept of "public land" among the masses is relatively weak. Therefore, the situation is different from Liaocheng. In another type of city, except for public property, the land for general housing foundations is clearly privately owned, which is not a problem. The question is how to determine the land rights of the above two types of cities. Please study and reply.
    (2) The issue of landlords' houses in cities: This article does not mention this part. The actual situation is: part of the urban houses of rural landlords are not rented out, but are occupied by the household or managed by others on their behalf; part of them are urban landlords with no residences in the countryside. In short, they are all feudal property (relying on land for a living, feudal exploitation). It seems that the former should also be confiscated and distributed, and the latter, except for the part left for their own use, should also be confiscated and distributed. Is this appropriate?
    Furthermore, can the real estate confiscated in cities (bureaucratic capitalists, reactionaries, landlord property) be uniformly allocated and used by the city government or the representative assembly in accordance with the principle of "taking into account both public and private interests"? That is, based on the specific situation of the houses (structural form and location, etc.), the needs of the urban poor residents, and the government's need for allocation (determining the private ownership of those allocated to the masses), rather than mechanically stipulating that certain types belong to the masses and certain types belong to the government, is this possible?
    (3) The property of guilds and feudal superstitious organizations: The former, such as the Shanxi Guild, the Guangdong Guild, etc., are either completely unmanaged, or although they are nominally managed, they have no effect, and the managers have changed hands several times, and the original builders no longer exist. In our opinion, the government can take over those that are unmanaged. How should those that are managed be handled? Currently, the war damage in the small and medium-sized cities of our province is particularly severe, and there are very few public houses. Most of these houses are occupied by our government agencies and schools. If their private ownership is determined, then rent should be paid according to the principles. However, currently, one is that the government's financial resources are insufficient, and the other is whether the property rights of such semi-feudal regional groups should still be protected. This is also a problem. Secondly, some purely feudal superstitious reactionary organizations in the city, such as the "opium detoxification centers" of the secret society (actually a pseudonym for superstitious organizations), etc., have been explicitly banned by our government. In our opinion, their property should also be confiscated by the state.
    (4) Church property: It should generally be retained. However, some have been unattended for a long time (quite a few in old revolutionary base areas), or although there are individual believers managing them, they cannot represent the church organization and there are no regular religious collective activities. Many are currently occupied by our government agencies and schools. How should this type of property be handled?
    The above questions are all related to the determination of urban property rights and urgently need to be resolved. Please study and provide a reply.
   Sincerely,
                                          Pingyuan Provincial People's Government Civil Affairs Department

### 关于城市房屋问题答平原省政府民政厅问

专栏：人民信箱

    关于城市房屋问题答平原省政府民政厅问
    平原省人民政府民政厅一九四九年九月九日所问关于城市地产房屋问题，经送给政府主管机关研究，答复如下：
    （一）平原省人民政府民政厅提出了两种情况，即：一、官地民房，官地仍为公有；二、官地民房，但官地已转为私有，私人且已取得了旧政府的红契作为凭证。我们认为对于这两种情况的处理原则应为：不论属于那一种情况，首先均应承认其私人房产的所有权，并予以保护。至于房屋所占地产，无论官地是否已转化为私有，均应暂时不作处理，而仍按习惯办事。如果政府必需征用此项地基时，则应按照地基上所筑私人房屋值价情况，给以适当代价，然后收回或征用。对于同样价值的房屋，如其所占官地已转为私有者，不妨酌量多给一些代价。目前仍归政府所有的可耕的空地，除必需保留者外，应以低租租给群众耕种。但其所有权仍归政府，以便将来国家建设或市政建设需用该项土地时，得随时收回。今后政府对于所有公地应该制定规章加以管理，私人欲在公地建筑房屋，必须呈经政府允准，否则以侵犯公产论处。
    （二）地主在城市中的房产，情形十分复杂，一般地不能认为是封建财产。因此，城市中的房屋，无论是属于城市地主或乡村地主所有，现在都不得没收。官僚资本和反革命分子或恶霸分子的房产，经政府判决明令没收者，即归政府所有，列为公产，不应分配。至于他们恃强霸占私人部分，得经政府酌情判决，发还原主。
    （三）会馆虽属封建团体，但它往往依靠会馆产业曾经作了或正在作着某些公益事业，为群众所欢迎，与一定的群众有若干联系，其房产不应没收或接收。如某些会馆已无人负责和保管，政府可以出面代管，将来视情形再作根本解决。此种政府代管的会馆，可由机关团体学校住用，但应负保护和修缮之责，不得加以损毁。至有人管理之会馆，政府即不应借口代管，加以接收。如机关、团体、学校确实需用时，则可向会馆管理人交涉租用，城市中一般宗教迷信团体的房产（如教堂、庙宇、寺院等），均应加以保护，不得没收。某一宗教迷信团体，如进行叛国活动或反革命阴谋，经政府查有实据，明令取缔者，其房产可由政府没收归公。但这里必须严格区分团体和个人的行为，如进行叛国活动或反革命阴谋的仅系某一个或某几个个人，而整个团体只是一般宗教迷信组织，并无反动犯罪行为，即应处分个别犯罪分子，而勿随便取缔整个团体和没收该团体的房产。
    （四）政府对于教会房产应该保护，并允许，教民有宗教活动的自由，机关部队不得占用教堂，如必需借用教会房屋时，须和教会协商，得其允许。如果教会房产已经无人保管，政府可以加以代管，但原保管人返回时，即应发还。
    附来信人民日报编辑部同志：
    看到八月三十日平原日报所载新华社信箱《关于城市房屋房租的性质和政策》一文，在我们思想上解决了不少糊涂观念，但还有几个与城市房产有关的问题，感到在该文中尚找不出具体解决的原则或办法，同时又都是当前处理城市房产中常常遇到的问题，特提出，请作答复：
    （一）关于“官地民房”问题：该文中提出：“因为城市土地有填平整理关系，有若干投资在内，并且经过几次手的买卖，其情形比较复杂，且已构成房产资本的不可分离的一部分，和农村土地不同，因此目前亦应暂不处理。”关于城市中私人地产除去官僚资本及罪大恶极反革命分子之地产外，应该采取这一原则，但据我们调查在平原省聊城县城关区土地情况是这样：该城城关（护城堤以内）之土地，过去全系官地，历史上由来已久，并为当地居民所公认，如该城过去税契时，红契上只注明房屋间数，无土地长阔尺寸亩数，政府亦不收钱粮，空地有收益者（如苇坑、耕地等），由旧政府出租，人民在土地上修建房屋，房屋属于私有，可以自由买卖转让，房基亦可转让，转让并有一定价格，但这是使用权之转让，如一旦政府需使用该项土地时，可以无价收回。类此，土地既向来即属国有，今后似亦应确定为国家所有，但又因全城关土地均系如此，影响范围又非常大，因之，迄今该城城关地权仍未确定。另外一部城市（如朝城、阳谷等），过去“官地民房”之遗迹仍存，如过去红契上亦无房基尺寸亩数，不交纳钱粮等，但有一部分很早以前已转化为私有，因之一部分已取得旧政府红契，并且旧政府在过去使用土地时，有的也付出一定地价收买，群众中“官地”之观念已比较薄弱，因之情况已与聊城不同。再一种城市，则除公产外，一般房基土地是明确私有的，不成问题，就是以上两种城市之地权究应如何确定，请研究答复。
    （二）地主城房问题：该文中未提及这一部分。实际情况是：一部乡村地主之城房并非出租，系由本户住用或交他人代管，一部是本城地主，乡村中并无住宅。总之均系封建财产（依靠土地为生，封建剥削方式），前者似亦应没收分配，后者除留给其住用之部分外，似亦应没收分配，是否合适？
    再则，城市内没收之房产（官僚资本，反动分子，地主房产）是否可由城市政府或代表会根据“公私兼顾”之原则统一调剂分配使用？即依照房屋具体情形（构筑形式及位置等），与城市贫苦居民需要情形及政府需要调剂分配（分配给群众者，即确定其私有权），而不机械规定某类归群众，某类归政府，是否可以？
    （三）会馆与封建迷信团体之房产：前者如山西会馆、广东会馆等，有的已完全无人经管，有的虽名义上有人经管，但已毫无作用，且经管人也几易其手，原修建人已不存在了，我们意见，无人经管者，政府可接收，有人者如何处理？现我省各中小城市战争中破坏特甚，公房甚少，此类房屋多为我机关学校住用，如确定其私有权，则照理应交纳房租，但目前一则政府财力不足，再则类此半封建的地域性团体，其财产权是否仍应予以保障？也是个问题。其次，城市中一部纯封建迷信之反动团体，如会道门“戒烟所”（实际上是迷信团体之化名）等，此等组织已为我政府明令取缔，我们意见，其房产亦应归国家没收。
    （四）教会房产：一般应予保留。但有一部已久无人主持（老区集镇上颇多），或虽有个别教徒经管，但他并不能代表教会组织，且又无经常性的宗教集体活动，目前为我机关学校住用者不少，类此房产如何处理？
    以上几个问题，都是与目前城市房产权之确定有关的，急需解决，请作研究，并望给予答复。此致
   敬礼
