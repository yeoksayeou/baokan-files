    Jilin Jiutai County Runs Midwifery School
    To Train Rural Midwives
    Huinan County Reforms Old Midwives
    [This newspaper reports] In order to cultivate midwifery talent and carry out maternal and child health work in rural areas, the Jiutai County People's Government and the County Women's Federation in Jilin Province opened a midwifery school in October last year. Currently, there are 66 students, all of whom were introduced by the women's federations of various districts and villages. The students are between the ages of seventeen and twenty-five, with varying levels of education ranging from junior high school to primary school graduation. The study period is scheduled for one year. The courses include: political common sense, health common sense, physiology and anatomy, obstetrics, epidemic prevention methods, and first aid. Most of the teachers are local professional midwives who volunteer their services. In addition to classroom lectures, teachers also take students to practice when they go out to deliver babies. The students are very diligent and are making rapid progress.
    [This newspaper reports] Huinan County, Liaodong Province, held its first training class for old midwives in December last year. The training period lasted half a month, and there were 26 trainees. According to a survey, they have delivered a total of 2,651 babies, and generally have more than five years of delivery experience. Among them, there is an old woman named Li who started delivering babies at the age of 22 and is now 58 years old, with 36 years of delivery experience. She has delivered a total of more than 1,300 babies. After the school started, the teachers first had informal talks with them to allow everyone to talk about their understanding and methods of delivery. It is understood that their delivery methods are mostly unscientific. The infant mortality rate after their delivery is extremely high. Eight of them delivered a total of 73 babies, and 52 died, the vast majority of whom died of convulsions. The teachers then analyzed and explained their different understandings, exposed anti-scientific and superstitious views and methods, and taught them correct delivery methods and maternal and child health knowledge. After the study, the trained midwives not only improved their skills, but also underwent preliminary changes in their understanding. They all said that they would no longer be superstitious in the future, and that they must be disinfected when delivering babies. At the time of graduation, 20 students bought sterile cotton, bandages, disinfectant, etc. to take back for application. They also expressed their willingness to go back to promote women's health, pregnancy health, and postpartum protection of the body and infant care.
    [Also reported] The second class of students at the Tonghua County Midwifery School in Liaodong Province, after more than four months of study, most can independently deliver normal births and have delivered 156 babies. The school has recently decided that in addition to keeping one class of students at the school to deliver babies, all students will go to six districts to carry out maternal and child health education and reform old midwives as an internship, with a scheduled time of half a month. It is expected to graduate in early February.

    吉林九台县举办助产学校
    训练农村助产士
    辉南县改造旧接产妇
    【本报讯】吉林九台县人民政府与县妇联，为培养助产人材，开展农村妇婴卫生工作，于去年十月开办了助产学校。现有学员六十六名，都是由各区村妇联会介绍入学的。年龄由十七岁至廿五岁，文化程度初中或小学毕业不等。学习期限预定一年。课程有：政治常识、卫生常识、生理解剖、产科、防疫法、救护法等。大部教员由当地职业助产士义务担任，除课堂讲授外，教员出外接产时并带学员实习。学员都很用功，进步很快。
    【本报讯】辽东省辉南县于去年十二月举办了第一期旧接产妇训练班，训练期历半个月，受训学员二十六人，据调查，她们共接产了两千六百五十一个小孩，一般都有五年以上的接产经验。其中有一个李老太太，从二十二岁接产，今年五十八岁，有三十六年的接产经验。共接产一千三百多个小孩。开学后首先由教员与她们漫谈，让大家谈自己的认识和接产的办法。据了解，她们的接产方法，多是不科学的。经她们接产的婴孩死亡率极大。她们之中的八个人共接了七十三个小孩，死亡达五十二个，绝大多数是抽风死的。教员乃根据她们不同的认识来分析、讲解、揭发反科学的、迷信的观点和方法，再教以正确的接生方法和妇婴卫生知识。学习以后，受训接产妇不但在技术上有了提高，在认识上也有了初步转变，都表示今后不再迷信了，接产时一定要消毒。结业时有二十名学员买了消毒棉、绷带、消毒水等带回应用。并愿意回去宣传妇女卫生、妊娠期卫生及产后保护身体与保育婴孩等。
    【又讯】辽东省通化县助产学校第二期学员，经四个多月学习，大部已能独立接正常产，并已接产一百五十六个小孩。该校顷决定除留一班学员在校接产外，全体学员分赴六个区去开展妇婴卫生教育及改造旧接产妇工作，作为实习，时间定为半月。预计二月上旬即可毕业。
