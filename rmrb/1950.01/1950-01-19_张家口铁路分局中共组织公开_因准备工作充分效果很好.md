The Chinese Communist Party organization of the Zhangjiakou Railway Bureau Goes Public with Great Results Due to Thorough Preparation

[Reported by this newspaper] The Chinese Communist Party of the Zhangjiakou Railway Bureau went public last November. This time, the work of making the Party public achieved good results because of thorough preparations beforehand. After the Party Committee of the bureau decided to make the Party public, the Party committees of Zhangjiakou, Nankou, Datong and other regions under its jurisdiction explained the significance of making the Party public to their respective subordinate branches. The Datong Party Committee introduced the experiences of the Northeast in making the Party public to the various branches; criticism and self-criticism were universally carried out among Party members, and everyone made a self-examination. During the deliberation, several confused ideas were found among Party members: some believed that the political theory and cultural level of Party members were not yet very high, and they were afraid that the masses would look down on them after the Party was made public; some advocated waiting until the Party members had overcome their shortcomings before making it public; individual Party members who had committed serious mistakes were afraid that the masses would raise opinions to the Party and expel them after the Party was made public, so they asked to be transferred before the Party was made public. In response to the above ideas, the Party Committee decided that all Party members should study the democratic style, the relationship between the Party and the masses, criticism and self-criticism, and other issues in the Party Constitution. Some branches also made ideological appraisals of each Party member. The Zhangjiakou Political Department and the Nankou Working Committee convened short-term training courses for Party members, League members, and active members of various units to specifically explain the Party Constitution and the relationship between the Party and the people. Through the training courses, the confused ideas of Party members were clarified, and the various ideological concerns of the masses outside the Party who were afraid to raise opinions were broken. Arrangements were also made in the Communist Youth League to ensure that League members first recognized the relationship between the Party and the League. Finally, the trade union launched discussions among its members, universally studied the Party Constitution, clarified the significance of making the Party public, and inspired members to make suggestions to the Party and Party members.

Because of the above preparations, the publicizing work of the branches in various units was quite successful. The branches all made work inspections and self-criticisms at public meetings, and each Party member made a self-examination of past work, and humbly stated their willingness to overcome shortcomings under the supervision of the masses, better serve the people, and be a model Communist Party member. Those who had made mistakes and shortcomings in their work style in the past were able to sincerely and frankly review them in front of the masses. As a result, the Party's prestige among the masses has been improved, and its connection with the masses has become closer. Railway employees in various regions have successively raised requests to join the Party at the public Party congress, and more than 150 people have raised requests in Zhangjiakou and Datong alone. People who did not dare to express their opinions boldly in the past because they did not understand the Party now spoke their minds without any scruples. For example, some people once mistakenly believed that it didn't matter if Party members and League members made mistakes, but the masses couldn't, so they were very afraid of being expelled for making mistakes. After the Party was made public, they realized that the Party's discipline was very strict with Party members. Some old workers in the Datong Telecommunications Section were eager to express their feelings about the Party at the meeting. Generally speaking, under the influence of the Party's publicization, most of the masses stated that they would emulate a good Communist Party member in their work and actions in the future.

    张家口铁路分局中共组织公开
    因准备工作充分效果很好
    【本报讯】张家口铁路分局中共党已在去年十一月公开，这次公开党的工作，因事先做了充分准备，获得良好效果。该分局党委决定党公开后，所辖张家口、南口、大同等地区党委即分别向各所属支部讲解了党公开的意义。大同党委向各支部介绍了东北公开党的各种经验；在党员中普遍展开了批评与自我批评，每人作了检讨。在酝酿中，发现党员有几种糊涂思想：有人认为现在党员的政治理论、文化水平还不很高，公开了怕群众看不起；有人主张等党员们都把缺点克服了再公开；个别犯过严重错误的党员则怕公开后群众会向党提意见开除自己，因而要求在公开前调动工作。针对以上思想，党委决定全体党员学习党章中的民主作风、党群关系，批评与自我批评等问题。一部分支部并对每个党员作了思想鉴定。张家口政治处及南口工委则调集各单位的党员、团员、积极群众开办短期训练班，专门讲解了党章及党与人民群众的关系。通过训练班弄清了党员的糊涂思想，对党外群众则打破了不敢提意见的种种思想顾虑。在青年团中亦作了布置，使团员首先认清党与团的关系。最后又由工会在会员中展开讨论，普遍进行党章的学习，阐明党公开的意义，并启发会员向党与党员提意见。
    因为作了以上的准备工作，各单位支部的公开工作都相当成功。支部都在公开大会上作了工作检查与检讨，每个党员都对过去的工作作了检讨，并虚心表明愿在群众的监督下克服缺点，更好为人民服务，要作模范的共产党员。过去在工作上作风上有错误和缺点的，都能在群众面前诚恳坦白地检讨出来。这样一来，党在群众中的威信提高了，和群众的联系更密切了。各地区铁路员工在公开党的大会上纷纷提出入党要求，仅张家口、大同两地提出要求者即有一百五十余人。过去因不了解党而不大胆提意见的人，现在都毫无顾忌地说出了内心的话。例如有人曾经错误的认为党员、团员犯了错误没关系，群众就不行，因此很怕犯了错误被开除。经公开党后，才知道共产党的纪律对党员的要求是非常严格的。大同电务段有些老工人，都争着在会上说出自己对党的感想。总的说来，大部分群众都在公开党的影响下表明自己今后要在工作上行动上向一个好的共产党员看齐。
