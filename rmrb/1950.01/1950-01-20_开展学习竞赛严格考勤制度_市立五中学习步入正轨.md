Implementing Learning Competitions and Strict Attendance Systems: Municipal No. 5 Middle School's Learning Enters the Right Track

[Our Paper Reports] Beijing Municipal No. 5 Middle School has initiated learning competitions and established a strict attendance system, which has stimulated students' ambition, strengthened teachers' care and assistance to students, and put learning on the right track. Before the learning competition, many students in the school were absent from class for no reason, asked for leave casually, or simply made up a leave slip after being absent. Although the school had stipulated that leave must be approved by the form teacher in advance, it could not be strictly enforced. In order to change the above situation, the Academic Affairs Office proposed this semester that the attendance system should not only be used as a basis for deducting points and punishments, but should also become a powerful weapon to promote learning, and decided to launch a learning competition movement. Challenges were launched by each class. In the tenth week, the Academic Affairs Office published for the first time a statistical table of the number of absent hours of each student in the past week. Two days later, statistical tables of the number of absent hours of each class and grade, as well as a comparative table of the number of absent students in each grade, were published with curves and colored pens. The class with the fewest absences was marked with a red flag, and the class with the most absences was marked with a black flag, with a challenging title added: "Let's compare, which class is the best and which is the worst?" When it was announced in the eleventh week, in addition to the above charts, a weekly total statistical table of the number of absent hours in each class with comparability and correlation was added. In this table, the development process of absenteeism in each class during a week was shown by red and black arrows in the numbers, indicating the increase or decrease in absenteeism. The appearance of the statistical table greatly stimulated the students' ambition and the teachers' sense of responsibility. Since then, every time the charts were announced, the form teacher of the "black flag class" would go to the Academic Affairs Office and ask: Why did you give us the black flag? After checking the absence table and attendance table, the form teacher would record the names, hours, and dates of the absent students, go back to study the reasons, talk to them, patiently educate them, and even visit the students' families in person. At the same time, class groups also went to the Academic Affairs Office to investigate, preparing to persuade or criticize at the group meeting later. Class B of Junior Grade Two was awarded the black flag twice, and Wang Chunwan was the naughtiest among the absent students. With the continuous help of the form teacher and classmates, not only has the number of leave requests been greatly reduced, but he has also become an active student. Other classes are in the same situation. In order to win the entire class and promote learning, the excellent Class B of Junior Grade Three launched challenges between groups and individuals. A challenge letter to the whole school was also announced in the class bulletin board, guaranteeing no lateness, no absenteeism, and no leave requests, which attracted the attention of the whole class. In order to prevent the "five-minute enthusiasm," good students were commended at any time within the group, and bad students were persuaded or criticized, encouraging everyone to persevere. Finally, in the eleventh week, the whole class achieved excellent results with no absences. Class A of Senior Grade One also achieved excellent results in the fourteenth week under the same circumstances.

Since the learning competition, teachers have adopted a very cautious and responsible attitude towards students' leave requests, analyzing whether it is necessary and how much time is needed, and trying to educate students to reduce absenteeism. Generally, students who used to be often absent or late can now consciously abide by the system. If this movement can be persisted in, the school's formal learning will surely be done well.

    开展学习竞赛严格考勤制度
    市立五中学习步入正轨
    【本报讯】北京市立第五中学经过学习竞赛，建立了严格的考勤制度，激发了学生的进取心，加强了教员对学生的关怀和帮助，使学习步入正轨。该校在没有学习竞赛之前，许多学生无故旷课，随便请假，或在旷课之后追补一张假条了事。该校虽也曾规定过请假必须事先经级任批准，但不能严格执行。为改变上述情形，今学期教导处提出了考勤制度不应专作为扣分、处分的根据，而应把考勤变为推动学习的有力武器，决定发起学习竞赛运动。由各班展开挑战。第十周，教导处第一次公布了上周各个学生缺课时数统计表，两天之后，又以曲线、色笔公布了各班、级缺课时数统计表及各级缺课人数比较表。缺课最少的班次标以红旗，最多者标以黑旗，并加上一行挑战性的标题——《比一比，那个班最好，那个班最坏？》第十一周公布时，除了上述图表外，又增添了一种有比较性、联系性的各班缺课时数每周总统计表。在这个表内，将每班一周间缺课的发展程序用红、黑色箭头在数字中串示出来，说明缺课时间的增加或减少。统计表的出现，大大刺激了学生的进取心和教员的责任心。此后，每次图表公布时，“黑旗班”的级任便找到教导处问：为什么把黑旗给了我们？把缺课表、考勤表校对后，级任便记下缺课学生的姓名、时数、日期等，回去研究原因，找他们谈话，耐心教育，甚至亲自到学生家庭访问。同时，班级小组也到教导处调查，准备以后在小组会上说服或批评。初二乙班两次落得黑旗，缺课学生中以王椿万为最淘气。经过级任和同学们的不断帮助，不但请假时数已大为减少，且变成了积极学生。其他班都有同样情形。优胜的初三乙班为了全班获胜，推动学习，曾开展组与组、个人与个人的挑战。又在班会布告栏内宣布了与全校挑战书，保证不迟到，不旷课，不请假，提起了全班同学的注意。为了防止“五分钟热度”，小组内并随时表扬好的，说服或批评坏的，鼓励大家坚持不懈，终于在第十一周全班以无一缺课的成绩获得优胜。高一甲班也以同样情形在第十四周获得优胜。
    学习竞赛以来，教员对学生请假都采取了极慎重负责态度，分析是否应该，应需用多少时间，尽量教育学生少缺课。过去经常旷课或迟到的同学，一般的也都能自觉遵守制度了。这一运动如能坚持下去，该校的正规学习一定可以做好。
