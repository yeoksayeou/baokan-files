    Under the Active Support of the People's Government
    Baoji's Private Industry Expands Production
    Output of Shenxin Yarn Factory and Others Exceeds Pre-Liberation Levels

    [Our Newspaper's News] In the five months since the liberation of Baoji City, Shaanxi Province, private industry has developed with the active support of the People's Government and the efforts of workers. The output of the city's textile, flour, and paper industries has been increasing daily. After receiving a loan of 50 million yuan from the Baoji branch of the People's Bank, the Taihua Cotton and Wool Textile Factory solved its working capital difficulties. Currently, in addition to operating its original 2,400 spindles, the factory plans to add 336 spindles to achieve a daily output of 3.5 pieces (compared to 3 pieces before liberation). The Weiqin Textile Supplies Factory, which was on the verge of shutting down before liberation, has been supported by state-owned yarn factories through direct orders after liberation. The Financial and Economic Department of the Military Control Commission also actively introduced private yarn factories to place orders with the factory. Currently, the factory's daily output has increased threefold compared to before liberation. Before liberation, the Shenxin Yarn Factory operated 52 spinning machines with 20,800 spindles. Now, the number of spinning machines has increased to 62, and the number of spindles has increased to 24,400. The number of looms has been restored to the pre-liberation level of 274. With the hard work of the workers, the output of the Fuxin and Daxin private flour mills has also gradually increased. The average daily output of Fuxin Flour Mill in October of last year was 1,800 bags, which has now increased to 2,100 bags. Daxin's output has increased from 1,200 bags to 1,400 bags per day. Before liberation, the Hongwen Paper Mill produced 70 reams of newsprint per day. After liberation, the output once dropped to 33 reams (in July). However, the situation gradually improved after August of last year, reaching 74 reams per day in October. In November, it further increased to 90 reams, with the highest output reaching 102 reams per day. At the same time, the workers of the factory adjusted the machines as much as possible to reduce the amount of waste products. In early October, the daily waste paper was about 2 reams, which was reduced to half a ream in late October. Before liberation, the Donghua, Taichang, and Xiehexin match factories were all affected by the dumping of foreign goods. The first two factories had closed down due to financial losses. Xiehexin also suffered severe damage during the escape of the Ma bandits, and production was on the verge of collapse. After liberation, with the loan support from the People's Bank, Xiehexin has restored its old production level, and Donghua Match Factory also resumed production on November 12 of last year.

    人民政府积极扶植下
    宝鸡私营工业扩大生产
    申新纱厂等产量均较解放前提高
    【本报讯】陕西省宝鸡市私营工业，解放后五个月来在人民政府积极扶植及工人努力下已获发展。该市纺织、面粉、造纸等业产量与日俱增。泰华棉毛纺织厂经人民银行宝鸡支行贷款五千万元后，解决了资金周转困难，现该厂除已开动原有二千四百余枚纱锭外，并计划增开三百三十六枚纱锭，以达到日产三件半的产量（解放前日产三件）。在解放前几陷于停顿的维勤纺织用品厂，解放后，公营纱厂即以直接定货方式扶植其发展生产，军管会财经处亦积极介绍各私营纱厂到该厂订货，目前该厂日产量已较解放前提高三倍。申新纱厂解放前开五十二台纺纱机，纱锭二万零八百枚，现纺纱机已增至六十二台，纱锭增至二万四千四百余枚，织布机则已恢复到解放前的二百七十四台。福新、大新两私营面粉厂在工人的努力生产下，产量亦均逐渐提高。福新面粉厂去年十月份平均日产一千八百袋，现增至二千一百袋。大新则由日产一千二百袋增至一千四百袋。宏文造纸厂解放前日产白报纸七十令，解放后曾一度降为三十三令（七月间），去年八月后渐形好转，十月份即达日生七十四令。十一月份又增至九十令，产量最高时达日产一百零二令。同时该厂工人尽量调整机器，使废品数量减少，十月上旬每日废纸约两令，十月下旬即减至半令。东华、泰昌、协和新三家火柴厂，解放前由于外货倾销，前二家均先后因资金亏损关门停工；协和新也因马匪败窜时破坏惨重，生产几濒停顿。解放后经人民银行贷款扶植，协和新已恢复旧日生产水平，东华火柴厂也于去年十一月十二日开工生产。
