Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 24th: Mrs. Grete Weiskopf, wife of the Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, Dr. Weiskopf, visited Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, at 3 p.m. on the 21st. On behalf of the Czechoslovak National Women's Committee, Grete brought a letter saluting Chinese sisters, as well as materials on the participation of Czech women in construction and safeguarding world peace, and presented them to Chinese women. The letter from Czech women to Chinese women was written in Chinese, and the original excerpt is as follows:

    Dear Sisters!

    We Czechoslovak women are following the discussions of the First Asian Women's Representative Conference with great interest, and we are excited and satisfied with the achievements already made at this important conference.

    We are very pleased that Comrade Hrdinová-Špálová, Chairman of the Czechoslovak National Women's Committee, personally participated in the conference, because she was able to convey to the Chinese women our infinite admiration and sisterly feelings for the Chinese women at the conference. As you know, Czech women are constantly concerned with the struggle for freedom, because every victory in this struggle has the significance of strengthening the world peace camp under the leadership of the powerful Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

    We know that women in your country have a glorious record in the Chinese people's struggle for freedom. Moreover, they undoubtedly occupy one of the leading positions in construction work.

    Long live the permanent friendship between progressive women of Asia and Africa and Czech women!

    Long live democratic China and the heroic Chinese women!

    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

    Long live the world peace camp!

    Long live the first fighter for world peace:
    Long live the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
    Long live Marshal Stalin, the teacher and leader of progressive mankind all over the world!

                                      Czechoslovak National Women's Committee
                                  December 14, 1949, Prague
