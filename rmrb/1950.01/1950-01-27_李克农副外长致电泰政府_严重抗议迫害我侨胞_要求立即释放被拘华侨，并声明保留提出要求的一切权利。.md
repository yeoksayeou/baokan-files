Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th - Li Kenong, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, today lodged a serious protest with the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the Thai government's mistreatment and killing of overseas Chinese. The full text of the protest is as follows:

To His Excellency Nai Pote Sarasin, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Thai Government:

The Ministry has recently received reports from Fang Jingnan, Chen Yide, Ke Jiashou, Li Renchuan, and Liang Mingguang, representatives of overseas Chinese detained by the Thai government in Bangkok's main prison. The reports state that thousands of overseas Chinese have been arrested and imprisoned by the Thai government, or are about to be deported, for supporting the People's Republic of China led by Chairman Mao Zedong. They also state that they have been detained in Bangkok's main prison for nearly half a year, and many have been held in underground darkrooms, handcuffed and shackled. They are frequently beaten, and more than a dozen have been beaten to death or poisoned.

I hereby, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, lodge a serious protest against the Thai government's illegal detention, abuse, and killing of Chinese nationals in Thailand. I believe that the Thai government should bear full responsibility for this atrocity. I demand that the Thai government: (1) immediately cease the abuse of overseas Chinese detained in Bangkok's main prison; (2) immediately release these detained overseas Chinese and cease deporting overseas Chinese; (3) ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future.

I also declare, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, that we reserve all rights to make demands regarding the Thai government's illegal detention, abuse, and killing of overseas Chinese.

        Li Kenong, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
        January 26, 1950, in Beijing

    李克农副外长致电泰政府
    严重抗议迫害我侨胞
    要求立即释放被拘华侨，并声明保留提出要求的一切权利。
    【新华社北京二十六日电】我国外交部副部长李克农于今日向泰国外交部就泰国政府虐待和杀害华侨问题提出严重抗议。抗议全文如下：泰国政府外交部长乃朴·沙拉信先生阁下：
    本部最近接到被泰国政府拘禁于曼谷大监狱的华侨代表方泾南、陈益德、柯家守、李壬川、梁明光的报告。据报告上说：有华侨上千人因拥护毛泽东主席所领导的中华人民共和国，被泰国政府逮捕入狱，或将被驱逐出境。又说：他们在曼谷大监狱被拘押的时间最长的已近半年，并有许多人被关在地下暗室里，带上手铐脚镣。他们经常地遭到殴打，并有十余人被打死或被毒毙。
    本人特代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府，对泰国政府此种非法拘押、虐待与杀害中国在泰侨民的行为，提出严重抗议。本人认为泰国政府应对此种暴行担负全部责任。本人要求泰国政府：（一）立即停止对于被拘押在曼谷大监狱的华侨的虐待行为；（二）立即释放这些被拘押的华侨，并停止驱逐华侨出境；（三）保证以后不再发生同样事件。
    本人并代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府声明：对于此次泰国政府非法拘押、虐待和杀害华侨的行为保留提出要求的一切权利。
              中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部副部长  李克农
