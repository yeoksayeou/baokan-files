Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 17th. People from all walks of life in Chongqing gathered on the 15th to mourn deeply General Yang Hucheng and hundreds of martyred comrades who were murdered by the Kuomintang bandit gang in the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" of the American-Chiang secret service, as well as the martyred comrades who died protecting factories before the liberation of Chongqing. In the memorial hall, portraits of General Yang Hucheng and some of the martyrs were displayed, and the venue was adorned with elegiac couplets and wreaths from all walks of life. Those who attended the ceremony included Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Second Field Army, Deng Xiaoping, Political Commissar, Zhang Jichun, Director of the Municipal Military Control Commission, Chen Xilian, Mayor, Cao Diyi, Deputy Mayor, Zhang Linzhi, Deputy Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chu Tunan, representative of the Democratic League, representatives of other party, government, and military organs, and representatives of workers, students, youth, women, cultural and educational, and industrial and commercial groups, totaling more than a thousand people. The families of hundreds of martyrs were present, silently weeping, and the whole audience was filled with grief and solemnity. After the memorial ceremony, Zhang Jichun, the chief celebrant, delivered a speech saying that Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang used weapons given to him by American imperialism to murder General Yang Hucheng, who had contributed to the country and the nation, and hundreds of martyrs who bravely fought for national liberation and people's democracy. This does not indicate the strength of the reactionaries, but rather the extremely vile and ugly performance of the reactionaries' death throes. The bandit gang's massacre in the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" cannot save them from their demise on the Chinese mainland. The Chinese people must pursue them to the ends of the earth, arrest the culprits, and bring them to justice. He said: The death of General Yang Hucheng and hundreds of martyrs is glorious. They died for the survival and liberation of our nation and 475 million people, demonstrating the heroic spirit of our people and their fearless spirit of regarding death as going home. Therefore, while we are deeply saddened and indignant on the one hand, we also feel glorious and proud on the other. He finally called on everyone to heighten their vigilance, smash the conspiracies of the remaining enemies, and transform grief and anger into strength to realize the aspirations of the martyrs. Chu Tunan said: We must settle this blood debt with the remnant Chiang bandits and their supporters, American imperialism. We have the People's Liberation Army with the active support of the powerful people of the whole country, and we will surely be able to settle this blood debt. Mayor Chen Xilian, General Kong Congzhou, and writer Ai Wu also spoke successively. Following this, the families of the martyrs delivered their replies. Yang Zhengmin, the eldest son of General Yang Hucheng, said: "My father was imprisoned for twelve years, and finally, the whole family was murdered, and even the secretaries and followers were not spared. Other martyrs were also brutally murdered. Such inhuman acts can only be done by the dregs of humanity and the dying beast Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, and only in the killing hell of the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization," a special agency supported and directly operated by American imperialism. This blood debt must be repaid with blood!" Then, Luo Yuanshu, the uncle of the martyr Luo Shiwen, Wang Jinyonghua, the mother of the martyr Wang Pu, Yu Zude, the brother of the martyr Yu Zusheng and a worker at the 21st Arsenal, and Cheng Qifeng, the wife of Jian Guozhi, a martyr who protected the factory at the 29th Arsenal, all spoke successively. They unanimously pointed out that the martyred comrades were glorious, and everyone should turn grief into strength and strive for the liberation of all of China and the construction of a new China.

On the same day, all newspapers in Chongqing published special memorial supplements and published editorials expressing the greatest indignation at the collusion between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek in slaughtering Chinese patriotic people with shockingly cruel means.

    重庆市各界悲愤集会
    追悼杨虎城暨死难烈士
    坚决向蒋美匪帮讨还血债
    【新华社重庆十七日电】重庆市各界于十五日集会沉痛追悼在美蒋特务机关“中美合作所”被国民党匪帮杀害的杨虎城将军和数百位殉难烈士，以及重庆解放前护厂殉难烈士。追悼会的灵堂上分陈杨虎城将军和一部分烈士的遗像，会场内外遍缀各界送来的挽联和花圈。到会致祭的有第二野战军司令员刘伯承、政治委员邓小平、市军管会主任张际春、市长陈锡联、副市长曹荻秩、中共重庆市委副书记张霖之、民主同盟代表楚图南、其他党政军机关代表，和工人、学生、青年、妇女、文教、工商等团体代表共一千余人。百余烈士家属含泪无声，全场悲愤肃穆。祭礼完毕后，主祭人张际春致辞说，蒋介石匪帮用美帝国主义给他的武器杀害有功于国家民族的杨虎城将军及几百个为民族解放和人民民主而英勇战斗的烈士，并不表明反动派力量的强大，而是反动派垂死挣扎的极卑鄙、极丑恶的表现。匪帮在“中美合作所”内的大屠杀，并不能挽救他们在中国大陆的覆灭。中国人民一定要追到天涯海角，捉拿罪魁归案究办。他说：杨虎城将军和几百位烈士们的死是光荣的。他们为我们民族和四万万七千五百万人民的生存和解放而死，表现了我国人民的英雄气概和视死如归的大无畏精神。因此我们一方面虽然沉痛悲愤，但另一方面又感到光荣骄傲。他最后号召大家提高警惕，粉碎残敌的阴谋活动，并化悲愤为力量，实现烈士们的遗志。楚图南说：我们要向残余蒋匪及其支持者美帝国主义清算这笔血债，我们有强大的全国人民积极支持的人民解放军，一定可以清算这笔血债。先后讲话的还有陈锡联市长、孔从周将军及文学家艾芜。继由烈士家属致答词，杨虎城将军长公子杨拯民说：“先父被囚十二年，最后全家被害，连秘书随从也不能幸免。其他先烈们也遭惨害。这种惨绝人寰的事，只有人类中的败类和垂死的野兽蒋介石匪帮才能做出，也只有在美帝国主义所支持与直接经营的特务机关“中美合作所”的杀人地狱里才能做出，这笔血债是要用血还的！”接着，罗世文烈士的叔父罗沅叔、王朴烈士的老母王金永华、余祖胜烈士的哥哥二十一兵工厂工人余祖德、二十九兵工厂护厂烈士简国治的夫人程其峰都先后讲了话，他们一致指出：死难的烈士们是光荣的，大家要化悲痛为力量，为解放全中国，建设新中国而奋斗。
    同日，重庆各报都出追悼特刊，并发表社论，对美蒋勾结以骇人听闻的残酷手段屠杀中国爱国志士一事表示最大的愤慨。
