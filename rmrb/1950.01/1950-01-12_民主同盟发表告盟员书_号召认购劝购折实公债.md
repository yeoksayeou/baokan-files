Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 11th: The headquarters of the China Democratic League issued a letter to its members, calling for subscription and promotion of the People's Victory Discounted Public Bonds. The abstract is as follows:

Comrades:

The Chinese mainland is completely liberated. What remains are only the remnant bandits in Tibet, Taiwan, and Hainan Island, who are yet to be eliminated. Therefore, one of our basic tasks in 1950 is to heal the wounds of war, overcome economic difficulties, and rapidly restore and develop industrial and agricultural production. In order to accomplish this task, the Central People's Government proposed in the 1950 budget to allocate 23.9 percent for construction expenditures. Because of this large amount of construction expenditure, there is a deficit of 18.7 percent today. Comrades, this fiscal deficit is caused by the Central People's Government's active policy of massively restoring and developing production, and it has a fundamentally different meaning from the fiscal deficits caused by the Kuomintang reactionary government's spending of large amounts of money on destructive military expenses.

The Central People's Government, on the one hand, wants to actively build, but on the other hand, it also takes into consideration the difficulties of the people's lives. Therefore, it has decided not to increase taxes in order to avoid increasing the burden on the people, and has decided to reduce the amount of currency issued in order to avoid affecting drastic fluctuations in prices. In order to make up for part of the deficit, it has now decided to issue 200 million shares of Victory Discounted Public Bonds. Comrades, this measure of the government is completely correct. Because buying public bonds is a loan from the government to the people, and the government will still have to repay the principal and interest in the future, this is based on voluntarism, and everyone can share a part according to their ability. We must actively support the issuance of this public bond, and regard subscribing, promoting and urging others to subscribe to the discounted public bonds as a glorious task for every member of the League. We must widely publicize, telling everyone that the successful implementation of the discounted public bonds means the smooth progress of our construction undertakings, the relative stability of prices, and the relative balance of the people's burden. We must mobilize experts and professors to express their opinions on this matter and give special lectures, so that everyone understands the national policy and promotes their concern and attention to the government's important measures. We must mobilize all members to use the relationships of groups, families, relatives, and friends to promote and urge purchases, and launch competitions between groups and groups, institutions and institutions, and individuals and individuals to create a surge of buying public bonds.

Comrades, subscribing and promoting discounted public bonds is a political task. We hope that you can concentrate your efforts on doing it, and we wish you success in advance.

    民主同盟发表告盟员书
    号召认购劝购折实公债
    【新华社北京十一日电】中国民主同盟总部为号召认购及劝购人民胜利折实公债发表告盟员书。摘要如下：同志们：
    中国大陆是完全解放了，剩下来的，只还有西藏、台湾、海南岛的残余匪帮还有待肃清。所以我们在一九五○年的基本任务之一，乃是在于医治战争的创伤，克服经济的困难，迅速恢复和发展工农业的生产。为了要完成这个任务，中央人民政府乃在一九五○年度的支出预算内提出百分之二三·九来作为建设费用。因为有了这一大笔的建设支出，所以才造成了今天百分之十八·七的赤字。同志们，这个财政赤字是在中央人民政府大量恢复和发展生产事业的积极政策下所造成的，它和国民党反动政府时代，以大量的金钱支付破坏性的军事费用而造成的财政赤字，是有着本质上不同的意义。
    中央人民政府一方面要积极建设，但同时也顾念到人民生活的艰难，所以它决定不再增税，以避免增加人民的负担，决定减少通货发行额，以免影响物价的激烈波动。为了弥补部分的赤字，它现在已决定要发行二万万分的胜利折实公债。同志们，政府的这一个措施是完全正确的。因为购买公债，这是政府向人民的借贷，将来政府还是要还本付息的，这是出之于自愿，每个人，都可各按其所能来分担一部分。我们必须积极拥护这次公债的发行，并把认购宣传劝购折实公债当作为每个盟员的光荣的任务。我们必须广泛宣传，告诉大家，折实公债的胜利推行，就是意味着我们建设事业的顺利进行，物价的相对稳定，人民负担的相对均衡。我们必须动员专家、教授，对于这个事情发表意见，并作专题演讲，使得大家明了国家的政策，和促使其对于政府重要措施加以关心和注意。我们必须动员全体盟员利用团体、家属、亲戚、朋友的关系来推销劝购，发动团体与团体，机关与机关，个人与个人之间的竞赛，制造出购买公债的热潮。
    同志们，认购劝购折实公债，这是一个政治任务，我们希望你们能集中精力来做，并预祝你们的成功。
