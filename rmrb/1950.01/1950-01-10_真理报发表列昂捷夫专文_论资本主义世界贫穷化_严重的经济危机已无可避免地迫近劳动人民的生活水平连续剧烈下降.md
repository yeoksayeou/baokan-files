Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The Truth newspaper published a special article by Leontiev, analyzing the reasons for the further impoverishment of workers in capitalist countries. He first pointed out that the entire capitalist world is inevitably approaching a severe economic crisis. Capitalist countries that rely on the United States politically and economically are feeling the increasing pressure from American monopoly capitalists trying to shift the burden of the crisis onto them. Today, in the entire capitalist world, there are more than 40 million unemployed, and the situation of those employed is also deteriorating.

　　The Entire Capitalist World Has More Than 40 Million Unemployed and the Employed Are Also Deteriorating

Leontiev wrote: Unemployment is a terrible word. There are already 100,000 unemployed in Maryland, USA. Its western district is officially called a "disaster area," which is what the United States calls all places where unemployment has reached a "threatening scale." According to American statistics, the number of unemployed in the United States has exceeded 4 million, plus "part-time workers" which reaches over 14 million. "Part-time workers" can only get one-third, one-quarter, or even one-tenth of the "normal" wage. In the UK, due to American competition, Lancashire's cotton textile factories, knitting factories, and British machine factories are closing down. Famous British shipyards are also in a desperate situation. In November alone, the number of unemployed in the UK increased from 291,000 to 323,000. In some other Marshall Plan countries in Western Europe, where American monopoly capital restricts local national industries, unemployment is also increasing. Italy has 2 million unemployed and 1 million part-time workers. The power of West German monopoly capital has been restored, and American companies have bought a large number of shares in companies there, calculating that they can get high profits under low wages and colonial "regulations." According to the official report of the Bonn puppet "government," the number of unemployed reached a huge figure of 1,387,513 in November last year. Crisis signs in the entire capitalist world—France, Brazil, Iran, or Turkey—are very significant, which is primarily manifested in production reduction and mass unemployment.

　　The Reason for the Suffering of the Working People in the Capitalist World is the Bandit Policy of American Imperialism.
　　The Main Reason for the Arms Race by Various Reactionary Governments is the Capitalist System

Leontiev said: The working people of capitalist countries not only suffer from the scourge of unemployment, but also the high cost of living, rising prices, and the constant decline in living standards are generally disturbing. In the UK, the minimum food needed by a family of five per week was 23 shillings and 9 pence in 1936, but it had risen to 48 shillings and 8 pence by the spring of 1949. And during this period, wages remained unchanged. After the recent devaluation of the pound, prices rose again and are continuing to rise. In France, last summer's real wages were only equivalent to 50% of the 1938 level. The devaluation of the franc caused a further rise in the prices of essential commodities, averaging 20%. In agricultural countries like Denmark, the price of items such as potatoes and meat rose by 30% last November. In the Netherlands, everything—cheese, butter, tea, fish—has risen in price. In this country where people are starving, tens of thousands of tons of vegetables and fruits are dumped in garbage heaps because the United States prevents it from exporting to West Germany. Italy can be said to be a "orthodox" Marshall Plan country. Since 1948 alone, the population growth rate has dropped from 11.4 per thousand to 9.8. The child mortality rate has increased from 70 per thousand to 75.6. This is natural, because two-thirds of the Italian population lacks the minimum living materials. Leontiev pointed out that the bandit policy of American imperialism is one of the reasons for the sharp and continuous decline in living standards in European capitalist countries. The arms race carried out by reactionary governments at the expense of the interests of the working people is another reason for the continuous decline in living standards in the United States and Western Europe. But the main reason for the deterioration of the living conditions of the working people in the United States, Western Europe, and other regions is the capitalist system itself. The Soviet Union has increased its industrial output more than ninefold in the past 20 years, while all Western European capitalist countries have stagnated at the 1929 production level. In the four years after the end of the war, the capitalist world is once again entering a severe economic crisis. Leontiev finally stated that the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are steadily progressing, developing their economies, and improving the material welfare of the working people, while the capitalist world is falling into a crisis, poverty, and greater impoverishment of the masses.

    真理报发表列昂捷夫专文
    论资本主义世界贫穷化
    严重的经济危机已无可避免地迫近劳动人民的生活水平连续剧烈下降
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报发表列昂捷夫的专文，分析资本主义国家的劳动者进一步贫困化的原因。他首先指出整个资本主义世界，正无可避免地迫近严重的经济危机。在政治上与经济上依靠美国的资本主义国家，正在感到美国垄断资本家力图把危机的负担转嫁于他们的日益增加的压力。今天在整个资本主义世界，有四千万以上的失业者，就业者的境况也正在每况愈下。
    整个资本主义世界失业者达四千万以上就业者也正每况愈下
    列昂捷夫写道：失业是一个可怕的名词。美国马利兰州已经有十万人失业。它的西区是官方所说的“受灾区”，这是美国对所有失业已具有“威胁性规模”的地方的称呼。根据美国的统计数字，美国的失业人数已超过四百万，加上“部分就业的工人”则达一千四百万以上。“部分就业的工人”只能得到“正常”工资的三分之一、四分之一，甚至十分之一。在英国，由于美国的竞争，兰开厦的棉织物工厂、针织工厂和英国的机器工厂都在倒闭。著名的英国造船坞也处于绝望的境地。仅在十一月份一个月中，英国的失业人数就从二十九万一千增加到三十二万三千。在西欧其他一些美国垄断资本限制了当地的民族工业的马歇尔化国家中，失业也在增加。意大利有二百万失业者，一百万作部分时间工作的工人。西德垄断资本的势力业已恢复，美国公司在那里收买了大量企业的股票，盘算着在低工资和殖民地“法规”的条件下可以得到高额的利润。根据波恩傀儡“政府”的官方报告，失业人数在去年十一月已达到一百三十八万七千五百一十三人的巨大数字。整个资本主义世界——法国、巴西、伊朗或土耳其——的危机征象，已甚为显著，这首先表现在生产减少与大批失业上。
    资本主义世界劳动人民苦难的原因是美国帝国主义的强盗政策是
        各反动政府进行军备竞赛主要原因是资本主义制度
    列昂捷夫说：资本主义国家的劳动人民不仅受着失业的鞭笞，昂贵的生活费用、物价的节节上涨和生活水平的经常下降，也普遍使人梦寤不安。在英国，一个五口之家一星期所需要的起码的食物，在一九三六年为二十三先令九便士，至一九四九年春季已涨到四十八先令八便士。而在这个时期中工资仍然原样未动。在不久前的英镑贬值之后，物价再度上涨，并在继续上涨中。在法国，去夏的实际工资仅抵得上一九三八年水平的百分之五十。法郎的贬值引起主要必需品价格的进一步上涨，平均上涨了百分之二十。在丹麦这样的农业国中，马铃薯、肉等物品的价格去年十一月上涨了百分之三十。在荷兰，一切食物——乳酪、牛油、茶、鱼——都涨了价。在这个人民挨饿的国家里，成千上万吨的蔬菜和水果由于美国阻止它向西德出口而倒在垃圾堆里，意大利可以说是“正统的”马歇尔计划国家。仅自一九四八年开始以来，人口增加率就自千分之十一点四下降到九点八。儿童死亡率自千分之七十增加到七十五点六。这是自然的，因为意大利人口中的三分之二缺乏最低限度生活的资料。列昂捷夫指出：美国帝国主义的强盗政策，是欧洲资本主义国家中生活水平剧烈与连续下降的原因之一。各国反动政府牺牲劳动人民利益而进行的军备竞赛，是美国及西欧生活水平不断下降的另一个原因。但美国、西欧及其他地区的劳动人民生活情况恶化的主要原因，则为资本主义制度本身。苏联在过去二十年来把工业产量增加到九倍以上，全部西欧资本主义国家则停滞在一九二九年的生产水平。在战争结束后的四年内，资本主义世界又正在步入严重的经济危机。列昂捷夫最后称：苏联及人民民主国家正稳步地向前进展，发展它们的经济，提高劳动人民的物质福利，而资本主义世界却正堕入危机、贫穷及人民大众更为贫苦的深渊里。
