    (Our report) Around the New Year, a new type of "military dance" emerged in the North China Military Region and some units of the Third Field Army. The content reflects the actual life of the troops and is closely integrated with sports, entertainment activities, and military education. During performances, some are accompanied by gongs and drums, while others sing and dance simultaneously, creating a lively, energetic, and healthy atmosphere. Moreover, it is easy to learn and perform, and is deeply loved by the broad masses of soldiers and people. Every time there is a proposal to organize this type of dance, many people volunteer to participate, actively practice, and study improvements. This new type of dance is the result of the promotion by leading cadres, the assistance of cultural workers in the troops, and the research and experimentation by the broad masses of soldiers. In order to create a dance that could both express the vibrant life of the troops and combine it with military movements, a certain unit sent propaganda team comrades deep into the companies to work with active members of cultural and entertainment activities in the companies. They jointly developed a dance based on the "Four Great Technical Songs," accompanied by gongs and drums, performing and singing simultaneously. After the performance, the soldiers responded, "This is pretty good. On the one hand, we practice skills, and on the other hand, we also promote cultural and entertainment activities." After the leadership called for promotion, there soon appeared the "Tank Dance," expressing soldiers wiping tank treads and cherishing tanks; "The Happy Cooking Squad," expressing cooks carrying water, starting fires, rolling noodles, and cutting vegetables, as well as labor dances, baseball dances, and "Iron Armor Ding Dong," etc. Some units of a certain division incorporated military actions such as bayonet practice, grenade throwing, shooting, and digging fortifications into dances.

    Similar "Soldier Dances" have also appeared in some units of a certain army of the Third Field Army. After the performance, the soldiers said, "It can truly express the heroic spirit of our revolutionary soldiers." "This is much better than the Yangge dance and beating the bully whip; this is entertainment for our soldiers!"

    创造新式军事舞蹈
    表现革命军人英雄气概
    深获广大战士群众喜爱
    【本报讯】华北军区及第三野战军某些部队中，新年前后出现了一种新式的“军事舞蹈”。内容是反映部队的实际生活，并同体育、娱乐活动及军事教育紧密结合；演出时，有的加以锣鼓等乐器配合，有的边歌边舞，紧张活泼，健康有力；而且易学易演，深获广大战士群众的喜爱。每次提出组织此项舞蹈时，都有很多人自愿参加，积极练习并研究改进。这种新式的舞蹈是经过领导干部的提倡，部队文化工作者的协助，由广大战士群众的研究试验所产生的。某部为了编一个既能表现部队的活跃生活，又能和部队军事动作结合的舞蹈，经宣传队同志深入连队，和连里文化娱乐工作的积极分子共同研究，把“四大技术歌”编成舞蹈，配以锣鼓，边做边唱。演出后，战士们反应：“这倒挺好，一方面练技术，一方面还把文娱工作搞起来了”。经领导上号召倡提后，不久又出现了表现战士擦拭战车履带、爱护坦克的“坦克舞”；表现炊事员挑水、拉火、杆面、切菜的“愉快的炊事班”，以及劳动舞、棒球舞、“铁甲叮咚”等；某师某些单位，则将部队中刺枪、投弹、射击、挖工事等军事动作编为舞蹈。
    第三野战军某军一些单位中，亦有类似的“军人舞”出现。演出后，战士们说：“它真能表现出咱们革命军人的英勇气概来。”“这比扭秧歌、打霸王鞭强多了，这才是咱们军人的娱乐呢！”
