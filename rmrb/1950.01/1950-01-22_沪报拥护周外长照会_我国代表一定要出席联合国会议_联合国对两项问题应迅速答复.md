Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th: The news of the Central People's Government's appointment of Zhang Wentian as the chief representative to the United Nations was published on the front pages of Shanghai newspapers today, along with supporting commentaries. Ta Kung Pao, in its commentary on this significant government measure, stated: "This is a heavy blow to the bandit gang's representatives and their supporters." "Now, the true representatives of the Chinese people have been announced." "Our representative must attend the United Nations General Assembly, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's 'representatives' must be expelled." Xinmin Evening News demanded that the United Nations respond quickly to Foreign Minister Zhou's note, pointing out that "If the United Nations does not want to become a garbage bin for harboring filth and accepting dirt, and if it does not want to become a voting machine manipulated by American imperialism, then it should respond quickly and satisfactorily to the two issues raised by Foreign Minister Zhou. That is: first, immediately expel the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang; second, welcome the delegation of the People's Republic of China to attend."

    沪报拥护周外长照会
    我国代表一定要出席联合国会议
    联合国对两项问题应迅速答复
    【新华社上海二十日电】中央人民政府任命张闻天为出席联合国首席代表的新闻，沪各报今日都在头条地位登载，并发表评论表示拥护。大公报评述政府这一重大措施时称：“这是对于匪帮代表以及其支持者的沉重打击。”“现在，真正代表中国人民的代表已经发表了。”“我国代表一定要出席联合国大会，蒋匪帮的‘代表’一定要被赶出去。”新民报晚刊要求联合国迅速答复周外长照会，指出“联合国假若不愿成为藏垢纳污的垃圾箱，假若不愿成为美帝操纵的投票机器，那么对于周外长提出的两项问题，应该迅速圆满地答复。那就是：第一、立刻开除蒋匪匪帮，第二、欢迎中华人民共和国代表团出席。”
