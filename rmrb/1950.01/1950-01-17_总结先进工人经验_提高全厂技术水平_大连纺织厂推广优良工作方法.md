    Summarize Advanced Workers' Experience, Improve Overall Plant Technical Level
    Dalian Textile Factory Promotes Excellent Working Methods
    [Our Newspaper News] In order to improve the technical level of all workers, the Dalian Textile Factory has been systematically and planned promoting the good working methods of advanced workers during the New Record Movement, achieving considerable results. After the launch of the New Record Movement, the Party, the Communist Youth League, the administration, and the trade union all paid attention to the workers' working methods. In the weaving workshop, it was discovered that the work situation of worker Qu Yanzeng and others differed from that of other workers. After research and understanding, it was found that they were more accurate and rational in their working methods and the allocation of time. After deliberation by all parties, it was decided to promote their working methods and experience throughout the factory. The Party, administrative, trade union, and Youth League leaders first helped Qu Yanzeng and others summarize their experience and prepare an outline, such as work attitude, preparation before work, how to use tools, and how to work, etc., asking Qu Yanzeng and others to make careful consideration and summarize all the experience. Then, a forum was convened for technicians and maintenance workers in the weaving workshop, where Qu Yanzeng reported on his working methods and experience. After the report, the production and technology section absorbed the opinions of other technicians, streamlined and popularized all the experience, and summarized it into eighteen points. Then promotion began. A general meeting of all weaving workshop workers was first held, where the model workers gave a detailed report on this experience, explaining the reasons why they improved output and quality. At the same time, management cadres who grasped the overall situation more specifically explained the advantages of these working methods; pointed out the shortcomings of the working methods of general workers, and compared them with each other to give everyone a deep impression. After the general meeting, the trade union immediately convened group meetings, based on the working methods of advanced workers, to examine each person's own work and clarify the shortcomings. Then, under the arrangement and mobilization of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union, the workers each formulated plans, and based on their own shortcomings, wrote down which of the advanced workers' working methods they wanted to learn, how much time it would take to learn, and what standards the output, quality, and savings would reach after learning. The group leader reviewed whether each person's plan was realistic and whether it could be completed within a certain period to ensure its effectiveness. In the subsequent implementation, checking the progress of each person's plan became the central content of each trade union group meeting, and problems arising in the implementation of the plan were discussed and resolved. At the same time, the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union frequently carried out publicity and education work, making full use of blackboard newspapers to promptly criticize and commend, and encourage workers to implement their plans.
    The promotion of advanced workers' working methods in the factory has achieved very good results in the weaving workshop. Then, the promotion method used in the weaving workshop was used to organize another working method promotion movement in the spinning workshop. This time, because the different objective conditions of the two workshops were not fully estimated beforehand, and the original promotion method was not changed as necessary, and the leadership's efforts were insufficient, although some achievements were made, the expected results were not achieved. Based on the advantages and disadvantages of the two works, the following lessons and experiences were obtained:
    (1) The promotion of working methods must have specific and in-depth organization and leadership. The reason why the weaving workshop succeeded was mainly because the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union cooperated closely, organized and led in a planned and step-by-step manner, grasped every link, and made every effort to implement it. When the promotion work in the spinning workshop began, the trade union representatives were busy attending the workers' congress and had no time to take care of it; the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the administrative departments did not grasp this work well either. Although they had also selected model workers, summarized their experience, wrote it into articles, and mobilized workers to learn, they did not grasp tightly the work of arranging plans, frequently checking the progress of plans, and encouraging and educating, so the effect was reduced.
            Promotion Methods Cannot Be Rigidly Applied
            Carefully Select Model Workers
    (2) Promotion methods should be adapted to objective conditions. The weaving workshop has a small number of people, and they all use the same machines to weave the same cloth. The situation is simple, and the working methods of individual workers can be applied to the whole. The spinning workshop has a large number of people, and the whole workshop is divided into five groups, such as fine spinning and coarse spinning. The types of products are different, the machines are different, and the operating methods are not completely consistent. In this case, it is necessary to take the group as a unit, each group selects the model workers of each group, summarizes the experience and carries out the promotion. This time, the textile mill also followed the general promotion method of the weaving workshop, so there were some places that were not suitable for each department.
    (3) Be cautious in selecting model workers. When the promotion work in the spinning workshop began, one of the model workers selected, although his technical level was high, he only talked but did not do, so his achievements were only slightly higher than those of ordinary workers, and the workers were not convinced. The general workers reflected that: "He doesn't do it himself, and he still comes to talk to us!" This caused a setback at the beginning of the work.
    Finally, it is proved by the promotion method of Dalian Textile Factory that many workers have very rich experience. If they are concentrated, summarized, and given the guidance of scientific principles, standard working methods for each workshop and workshop can be formulated, promoted and implemented, which will greatly improve production. Moreover, this work should be regular, because many workers are constantly giving full play to their spirit of active creation and are constantly improving their working methods and gaining new experience. Factory leaders should always take the initiative to discover, summarize, and promote, so that the technical level of all workers can continuously improve and move forward with advanced workers.

### 总结先进工人经验  提高全厂技术水平  大连纺织厂推广优良工作方法

    总结先进工人经验  提高全厂技术水平
    大连纺织厂推广优良工作方法
    【本报讯】为了提高全体工人的技术水平，大连纺织工厂在新纪录运动中有组织有计划地进行推广先进工人好的工作方法，收到相当效果。该厂在新纪录运动开展后，党、青年团、行政、工会四方面，即注意工人的工作方法，在织布场发现了工人曲言增等的工作情形与别的工人不同，经研究了解，发现他们在工作方法和时间的分配掌握上，比较精确合理。经各方研究酝酿之后，决定把他们的工作方法和经验推广到全场。党、政、工、团的领导上首先帮助曲言增等总结经验，拟好提纲，如工作态度、工作前的准备、工具如何使用、工作方法怎样等等，叫曲言增等作缜密考虑，把全部经验总结出来，然后召集织布场技术工人及保全工人等开座谈会，由曲言增报告工作方法和经验。报告后，生产技术科又吸收其他技术工人的意见，将全部经验加以条理化、通俗化，归纳成为十八条。随后即开始推广。先召开织布场全体大会，由典型工人将此项经验作详细报告，说明他们提高产量质量的原因。同时掌握全面情况的管理干部更具体地说明这些工作方法的优点；指出一般工人工作方法上的缺点，互相对比，使大家有深刻印象。大会开过后，工会随即召开小组会，根据先进工人的工作方法，检查各个人自己的工作，明确缺点所在。接着，在党、青年团、工会的布置动员下，工人各自拟订计划，根据自己缺点，写出要学习先进工人的那几条工作方法，多少时间学会，学会后产量、质量、节约等方面要达到怎样的标准。由小组长审查各人计划是否切合实际，能否在一定时期完成，以保证其效果。在以后的执行当中，检查各人计划的进度成为工会每次小组会的中心内容，并讨论解决贯彻计划中发生的问题。同时党、青年团、工会经常进行宣传教育工作，充分利用黑板报，及时批评表扬，鼓励工人贯彻自己的计划。
    该厂推广先进工人工作方法，在织布场进行效果很好。接着又以织布场所推行的方式在纺纱场组织另一次推广工作方法运动。这一次，由于事前没有充分估计到两个工场客观条件的不同，对原来推广方式未作必要的改变，同时领导上努力不够，虽然有些成绩，但未能收到预期的效果，根据两次工作的优缺点，得到以下几点教训和体会：
    （一）推广工作方法必须有具体深入的组织和领导。织布场之所以成功，主要是因为党、青年团、工会密切配合，有计划有步骤的进行组织领导，抓紧每一环节，用全力贯彻。纺纱场推广工作开始时，正值工会代表忙于开工代大会，无暇顾及；党、青年团及行政方面对这一工作亦未很好掌握，虽然也曾择选典型工人，归纳、总结经验，写成条文，发动工友学习，但在布置订计划、经常检查计划的进度等工作上抓得不紧，鼓励和教育也做得较差，因此就降低了效果。
            推广方式不能硬搬
            慎重选择典型工人
    （二）推广方式要适合客观条件。织布场人数少，并且都使用同样机器织同样的布，情况单纯，个别工人的工作方法可以适用于全体。纺纱场人数多，全场分精纺、粗纺等五组，产品种类不一，机器不同，操作方法也不完全一致，在这种情况下，就必须以组为单位，各组选择各组的典型工人，总结经验进行推广。这次纺织场还沿用织布场一般的推广方式，因此有些不适合于各个部门的地方。
    （三）选择典型工人要慎重。纺纱场推广工作开始时，选择的典型工人中有一人虽然技术水平高，但他只说不做，所以成绩比一般工人高得有限，工人不信服，一般工人反映说：“自己讲了不做，还来讲给我们听！”这样使工作一开始就受了一个挫折。
    最后，由大连纺织厂的推广工作方法中证明，有许多工人的经验非常丰富，集中起来，加以总结，并给以科学原理的指导，拟订各工场、车间的标准工作方法，推广实行，对提高生产有很大作用。而且此一工作应是经常性的，因为有许多工人不断在发挥积极创造的精神，时时在改进其工作方法，取得新的经验。工厂领导干部就应经常主动地去发现、总结、推广，使全体工人的技术水平能随先进工人不断提高前进。
