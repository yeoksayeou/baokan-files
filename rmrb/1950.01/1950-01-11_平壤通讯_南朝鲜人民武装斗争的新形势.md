    Pyongyang Dispatch
    New Situation in the Armed Struggle of the South Korean People
    Liu Guiliang
    The South Korean people's guerrilla force is still a young team compared to the people's guerrilla forces in other Southeast Asian countries. It has only been a year and two months since the armed uprising in Yeosu and Suncheon, South Jeolla Province, on October 20, 1948. Even counting from the armed resistance of the people of Jeju Island on April 3, 1948, it has only been a year and nine months. However, this South Korean people's armed force has rapidly developed in its victorious battles against the Lee Seung-man army and police under the command of US imperialism.

    From Mountain Areas to Rural Areas, from Rural Areas to Attacking Cities, Eliminating 10,000 Enemies in the Past Seven Months.
    For more than a year, the South Korean People's Guerrilla Force has broken through the "encirclement and suppression" of the so-called "Military and Police Suppression Team" jointly formed by US imperialism and Lee Seung-man, and has continuously annihilated the enemy, armed itself, and expanded and consolidated its forces and scope of activities in fierce battles. As of August 10, 1949, the guerrilla area of activity had expanded to eight provinces, seven cities, one hundred and eighteen counties, and six hundred and eighty-two districts out of the eight provinces, fifteen cities, one hundred and thirty-three counties, and one thousand five hundred and twenty-eight districts in South Korea. This means that the entire territory of South Korea has been reached by the people's guerrilla force. Guerrilla bases have been established in the mountainous areas of South Jeolla Province (including Jeju Island), North Gyeongsang Province, South Gyeongsang Province, North Jeolla Province, Gangwon Province, and North Chungcheong Province.
    There are two basic mountain ranges in South Korea: one is the Taebaek Mountain Range, which runs south along the east coast to the Busan area. Mount Odae, Mount Balwang, and Mount Daedeok in Gangwon Province, Mount Taebaek on the border of Gangwon Province and North Gyeongsang Province, and Mount Palgong in North Gyeongsang Province all belong to it. The other is the Sobaek Mountain Range, which slopes northwest and south from Mount Sobaek on the border of Gangwon, North Gyeong, and North Chung provinces, crosses the Chupung Pass, and forms the peak of Mount Jiri, forming the boundary between North and South Gyeongsang Provinces and North and South Jeolla Provinces. Mount Songni on the border of North Gyeongsang Province and North Chungcheong Province, Mount Deogyu on the border of South Gyeongsang Province and North Jeolla Province, etc., all belong to it. In addition, there is the Chaeryeong Mountain Range, which slopes southwest from western Gangwon Province. Most of these mountainous areas are under the control of the people's guerrilla force. Mount Halla on Jeju Island is entirely controlled by the guerrilla force.
    Now, the area of activity of the people's guerrilla force has gradually shifted from the mountains to the countryside. After the second half of August 1949, the guerrilla force had the organizational strength and combat effectiveness to attack cities and puppet police stations (county and city locations). In mid-August, the guerrillas broke into the county towns of Jangheung and Boseong in South Jeolla Province, Muju and Jeongeup in North Jeolla Province, Uiseong, Andong, and Yeongju in North Gyeongsang Province, and Geochang and Yangsan in South Gyeongsang Province, and attacked the police stations in each county. In September, they attacked Gwangju and Hampyeong, Yeongam, Jangseong, Jangheung, and Naju in South Jeolla Province, as well as Jeongeup in North Jeolla Province, Yeongdeok and Yeongju in North Gyeongsang Province, and Hapcheon and Miryang in South Gyeongsang Province. In October, they broke into Gwangju in South Jeolla Province twice on the 15th and 30th, engaged in street battles with the puppet military police, and attacked Boseong and Gokseong in the province, as well as Yeongyang and Andong in North Gyeongsang Province, and Jinju and Changnyeong County in South Gyeongsang Province. In the battle to attack Jinju, the guerrilla force received assistance from the navy uprising and annihilated four companies of the puppet National Defense Forces.
    According to the South Korean Workers' Daily, the guerrilla force, supported by the broad masses of the people, annihilated 7,811 puppet military police and captured 1,735 enemies in the seven months from April to October 1949. In October alone, 1,512 enemies were annihilated and 903 were captured. This figure is more than three times higher than in April (annihilating 716 enemies). The number of people mobilized by the guerrilla force is also increasing month by month. The number of people mobilized in October 1949 alone was 89,924. This is double the 44,000 people mobilized in August and five times the 16,257 people mobilized in April.

            The broad masses of farmers rose up in revolt, and the puppet National Defense Forces and Navy and Air Force also revolted one after another.
    The wave of large-scale farmer uprisings that began at the end of October 1949 shows that the people's guerrilla war in South Korea has entered a new stage. The broad masses of farmers, in resistance to the Lee Seung-man government's reactionary policies of grain requisition and purchase, rose up to respond to the people's guerrilla force and engaged in armed resistance. On the morning of October 29, more than 7,500 farmers from Damyang and Yeonggwang counties in South Jeolla Province first raised the banner of revolt, and quickly spread to other counties in South Jeolla Province, as well as the vast rural areas of North Jeolla Province, North Gyeongsang Province, and South Gyeongsang Province, developing into a raging uprising movement. The uprising farmers raised the national flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and in many areas, the People's Committee was restored. Recently, a democratic regime has also been established in the Ongjin County area in western Gyeonggi Province.
    In fact, the uprising is not limited to rural areas. Whenever the guerrilla force attacks towns, many residents rise up to respond, either cooperating with the guerrilla force to capture reactionaries, or opening prisons to rescue a large number of patriotic people imprisoned by the reactionary government, and joining the guerrilla force together. Within the Lee Seung-man puppet National Defense Forces, incidents of uprising by patriotic officers and soldiers also occur frequently. On September 16 last year, a detachment of the puppet National Defense Forces stationed in Gaeseong, Gyeonggi Province, revolted. On the 22nd of the same month, the puppet naval vessel "Smith," docked in Busan Port, announced its secession from the Lee Seung-man puppet government and sailed north to revolt. On the 24th, the puppet air force aircraft LMP-110 also staged a glorious uprising. On October 27, more than 300 officers and soldiers of the puppet navy stationed in Jinju, South Gyeongsang Province, revolted, and in coordination with the people's guerrilla force that broke into the city, annihilated four companies of the 22nd Regiment of the puppet National Defense Forces in one fell swoop.

            Victory will surely belong to the patriotic people, and the Lee Seung-man puppet's counter-revolutionary civil war plan will inevitably suffer a miserable defeat.
    Faced with the armed resistance of the South Korean people, the Lee Seung-man puppet government, under the instructions of its American masters, is now more frantically implementing forced "conscription" and "grain requisition" in order to strengthen the suppression of people's resistance and strengthen the invasion of areas north of the 38th parallel. In addition to the puppet "National Defense Forces" of seven divisions and twenty-six regiments, totaling about 89,000 people, and 56,000 reactionary police, the Lee Seung-man puppet government has also established armed special agent organizations such as the "National Defense Army," "People's Security Corps," "Great Korean Youth Corps," "Volunteer Police Force," and "Young Pioneers." Recently, he also attempted to organize a so-called "Youth Defense Force" of 200,000 people, forcibly conscripting soldiers in major cities and forcing young people over the age of 20 to enlist. However, this conscription has been strongly resisted by the broad masses of young people in South Korea. Young people in many places have refused to report and have distributed leaflets opposing conscription. In Daegu alone, more than 100 young people have been arrested for this. Even in Seoul, where the puppet government is located, the puppet government's Military Affairs Bureau recently had to admit the failure of forced conscription. Of the 10,900 people who were supposed to undergo physical examinations in the first phase in Seoul, only 3,000 had definite addresses, and the remaining 7,900 had fled in opposition to conscription. These show how lacking in political foundation the Lee Seung-man government's plan to strengthen the suppression of the people and launch a counter-revolutionary civil war is.
    The just struggle of the South Korean people's guerrilla force for the independence and reunification of the motherland is not isolated. It has the support of the entire Korean people and the international peace and democracy camp. Victory will surely belong to the patriotic people of South Korea.

    南朝鲜人民武装斗争的新形势
    刘桂梁
    南朝鲜的人民游击队，比起东南亚其他国家的人民游击队来，还是一支年轻的队伍。从一九四八年十月二十日全罗南道丽水、顺天的武装起义到现在，才仅仅一年零两个月，即从一九四八年四月三日济州岛人民武装抗争算起，也不过一年零九个月。但是，南朝鲜这支人民武装力量，已在与美帝国主义指挥下的李承晚军队和警察的胜利搏斗中，迅速地发展起来。
    从山地发展到农村，从农村发展到进攻城市，去年七个月中歼敌万人。
    一年多以来，南朝鲜人民游击队击破了美帝国主义及李承晚合组的所谓“军警讨伐队”的“围剿”，并在残酷的战斗中不断地歼灭敌人，武装自己，扩大并巩固了自己的队伍和活动范围。截至一九四九年八月十日，游击队的活动地区在南朝鲜的八道、十五市，一百三十三县、一千五百二十八区中，已扩展到八道、七市、一百一十八县、六百八十二区。这就是说南朝鲜的全境，都已有了人民游击队的足迹。在全罗南道（包括济州岛）、庆尚北道、庆尚南道、全罗北道、江原道、忠清北道的山岳地带中，都有游击队的根据地。
    南朝鲜的基本山脉有二：一个是太白山脉，沿东海岸南下，至釜山地方。江原道的五台山、发旺山、大德山，江原道和庆尚北道交界的太白山，庆尚北道的八公山，均属之。另一个是小白山脉，自江原、庆北、忠北三道交界处的小白山起，向西北南倾斜，越过秋风岭，构成智异山高峰，形成了庆尚南北道和全罗南北道的分界线。庆尚北道、忠清北道交界的俗离山，庆尚南道、全罗北道交界的德裕山等，均属之。另外，还有自江原道西部向西南倾斜的车岭山脉。这些山地的大部地区，都在人民游击队控制之下。济州岛上的汉拿山，则全部为游击队所控制。
    现在，人民游击队的活动地区已逐渐从山地转到了农村。一九四九年八月下半月以后，游击队已有袭击城市和伪警察署（县市所在地）的组织力和战斗力了。在八月中，游击队曾突入全罗南道的长兴、宝城，全罗北道的茂朱、井邑，庆尚北道的义城、安东、荣州，庆尚南道的居昌、梁山等县城，袭击了各该县的警察署。九月间，袭击了全罗南道的光州市和咸平、灵岩、长城、长兴、罗州，以及全罗北道的井邑，庆尚北道的盈德、荣州，庆尚南道的陕川、密阳等县城。十月间，先后于十五日、三十日两度突入全罗南道的光州市，与伪军警展开巷战，并袭击了该道的宝城、谷城，和庆尚北道的英阳、安东，庆尚南道的晋州市及昌宁县城。在袭击晋州的战役中，游击队获得起义海军的协助，歼灭了伪国防军四个连。
    据南朝鲜劳动者报载称，在广大人民支援下的游击队，在从一九四九年四月到十月的七个月中，歼灭了伪军警七千八百十一名，俘敌一千七百三十五名。只十月一个月，就歼敌一千五百十二名，俘敌九百零三名。这数字比四月（歼敌七百十六名），增加了三倍多。游击队的动员人数，也在逐月地增加。一九四九年十月一个月的动员人数，是八万九千九百二十四名。这比八月的动员人数四万四千名，增加了一倍，比四月的一万六千二百五十七名，增加了五倍。
            广大农民揭竿而起，伪国防军及海军空军亦纷纷起义。
    从一九四九年十月末掀起的农民大规模起义的浪潮，说明南朝鲜人民的游击战争，已步入了一个新的阶段。广大农民因反抗李承晚政府征粮征购的反动政策而奋起响应人民游击队，进行武装抗争。十月二十九日清晨，全罗南道潭阳、灵光两县的农民七千五百余人，首先揭竿起义，迅即以怒涛之势，扩展到全罗南道的其他各县，以及全罗北道、庆尚北道、庆尚南道的广大农村，发展成如火如荼的起义运动。起义的农民高举朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国旗，在许多地区，恢复了人民委员会。最近，连京畿道西部的瓮津县地区，也建立起民主政权了。
    事实上，起义的举动并不限于农村。每当游击队袭击城镇时，都有众多的居民起而响应，或则配合游击队捕捉反动分子，或则打开监狱，救出被反动政府囚禁的大批爱国人士，一同参加游击队。而在李承晚伪国防军内部，爱国官兵的起义事件，也是屡屡发生。去年九月十六日，驻京畿道开城的伪国防军一个分队起义。同月二十二日，泊于釜山港的伪海军舰艇“史密斯”号宣布脱离李承晚傀儡政府而起义北上。二十四日，伪空军飞机ＬＭＰ一一○号又举行光荣起义。十月二十七日，又有驻在庆尚南道晋州市的伪海军官兵三百余人起义，配合突入该城的人民游击队，一举歼灭了伪国防军第二十二联队的四个连。
            胜利一定属于爱国人民，李承晚傀儡反革命内战计划必遭惨败。
    面临着南朝鲜人民武装反抗的李承晚傀儡政府，目前正在其美国主子的指使下，更加疯狂地实行强迫“征兵”、“征粮”，以便加强对人民反抗的镇压，加强对北纬三十八度以北地区的侵犯。李承晚傀儡政府现在除了拥有伪“国防军”七个师团二十六个联队约八九万人，和五六万反动警察之外，还成立了“护国军”、“民保团”、“大韩青年团”、“义勇警察队”、“少年义勇团”等武装特务组织。最近，他又妄图组织二十万人的所谓“青年防卫队”，在各大城市强迫征兵，强迫二十岁以上的青年入伍。但是，这种征兵，遭到了南朝鲜广大青年们的强烈反抗。许多地方的青年都拒绝报到，并散发反对征兵的传单。在大邱一地，有百余青年因此被捕。即在伪政府所在地的汉城，伪政府的兵务局最近也不能不承认强迫征兵的失败。在汉城第一期应受体格检查的一万零九百人中，仅有三千名有确实地址，其余七千九百名均因反对征兵而逃亡。这些说明，李承晚政府企图加强镇压人民和发动反革命内战的计划，是多么缺乏政治基础。
    南朝鲜人民游击队为求祖国独立、统一的正义斗争，不是孤立的。它有着朝鲜全国人民与国际和平民主阵营的声援。胜利是一定属于南朝鲜爱国人民的。
