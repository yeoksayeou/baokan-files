[Beijing News] The Beijing Retail Company held an enlarged cadre meeting for several consecutive days from the 10th to the 14th of this month, determining the work guidelines and tasks for 1950. They discussed issues regarding supply targets and the work style of staff in various retail stores. The company's policy tasks are defined as: within the capabilities of the state-owned trading company, to strive for gradual rationalization of company operations, focusing all operations on supplying the broad masses with daily necessities such as grain, cloth, coal, oil, and salt. To reduce excessive intermediate exploitation by merchants, combat speculative profiteers, in order to achieve coordinated supply, stabilize prices, secure people's livelihoods, and restore and develop production. The temporary supply targets are set as: general working people such as workers and their families, small handicraft workers, vendors, staff and families of organizations and institutions, teachers and staff and their families, as well as poor working citizens, families of martyrs, military personnel, and cadres. Those who have joined cooperatives will be supplied by the cooperatives, and those who have not joined cooperatives will be supplied by the retail company. Retail targets for coal, cloth, and other items will not be restricted for the time being. The total number of people to be supplied by the retail company is planned to reach 700,000.

In order to better serve the people, the retail company has decided to adjust the locations of retail stores, universally retail edible salt, and strengthen the supply of cotton cloth; improve the quality of goods, promote sales with low profits, in order to meet the needs of buyers. The staff of retail stores should pay attention to improving and enhancing their operating skills, reverse the erroneous attitude of being irresponsible towards work and bureaucratic style, constantly listen to the opinions of the masses, and improve the shortcomings in their work at any time.
