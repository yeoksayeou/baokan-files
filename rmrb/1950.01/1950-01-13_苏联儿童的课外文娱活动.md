    Extracurricular Recreational Activities for Soviet Children
    Lǚ Hé, Compiled

    The Soviet Union pays special attention to and greatly values children's extracurricular activities and cultural facilities. The government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, one of the sixteen Soviet republics, alone sponsors 59 Palaces of Pioneers, 562 Houses of Pioneers, 289 Children's Centers for Cultural Technology, 189 Children's Natural Science Research Centers, 40 excursion and travel centers, and other academic organizations designed to encourage and develop the talents of young children. Similarly, such facilities exist in every federal republic.

    Major cities and towns, state-owned farms, and collective farms throughout the Soviet Union have established children's clubs, cultural technology research rooms, and more. After school, thousands upon thousands of children gather in magnificent buildings, perfect reading rooms, and science laboratories for discussion, learning, and research. A large number of child educators work in these clubs, Pioneer Palaces, and research rooms to closely cooperate with school education to develop children's talents and interests.

    Soviet children have a wide range of interests: science, mechanics, literature, art, music, drama, sports, travel, adventure, and more. In just two years, more than one million children participated in organized excursions, examining and studying local customs, practices, and natural conditions. Tens of thousands of children participate in Michurin Natural Science Research Groups. They study and experiment with new and diverse fruits, agricultural products, flowers, and trees. Young artists, physicists, mathematicians, horticulturalists, and inventors have a high degree of enthusiasm for learning, research, and competition. Children's art exhibitions, theatrical performances, musical performances, sports competitions, aircraft and car model making competitions, and more are frequently launched and held. There are also national children's chess competitions held annually. At the same time, there is a railway built by children themselves in Tbilisi. The staff of this railway, from workers to drivers, is entirely composed of children. All the necessary equipment here is also manufactured and supplied by the children.

    In addition to these different children's extracurricular organizations, there are also children's theaters and children's cinemas, which are exclusively for serving young children and are places for children's entertainment. There are fifty children's theaters and dozens of cinemas here, which specialize in performing plays or films for children; and some of the dramas are performed by the children themselves, which plays a great role in the enlightenment of children's wisdom and talent, and has achieved good results.

    In the Soviet Union, it is an established fact that children can receive education everywhere. They can not only be educated in the classroom, but also in their extracurricular activities. This education is living education, real education. (Translated from "Soviet Construction" Issue 4).

    苏联儿童的课外文娱活动
    侣禾  编译
    苏联对于儿童的课外活动以及文化设施方面，都是特别关心而予以莫大重视的。仅只苏联十六加盟共和国之一的俄罗斯联邦共和国政府，就主办了五十九所少年宫、五百六十二所少年馆、二百八十九个少年文化技术研究所、一百八十九处少年自然科学研究核心、四十个远足旅行中心站，以及其它为鼓励和发展少年儿童天才而设的学术组织。同样地，在每一个联邦共和国里都有此种设施。
    苏联的各大城市、村镇，各国营农场和集体农场都有儿童俱乐部、文化技术研究室等的设立。万千少年儿童在课余之暇，都聚满在宏伟的大厦中、完美的阅览室、科学研究室里讨论、学习和研究。为了与学校教育密切合作，来发展儿童的天才与志趣，大批的儿童教育工作者在这些俱乐部、少先宫及研究室里工作。
    苏维埃儿童的志趣是多方面的：如科学、机械、文学、艺术、音乐、戏剧、运动以及旅行和冒险探奇等等。仅在两年当中，就有一百多万的儿童参加了有组织的远足旅行，而且借以考察和研究了许多地方的风土人情与自然概况。成千成万的儿童都参加了米秋林自然科学研究小组。他们研究和实验那些新生的种类繁多的果实、农产品和果木鲜花等。少年艺术家、物理学家、数学家、园艺学家和发明家都有高度的学习研究和竞赛热情。举凡儿童艺术展览、戏剧表演、音乐演奏、运动竞技比赛、飞机及汽车模型制作竞赛等等都时常的展开和举行。另外还有年年在全国举行的儿童奕棋比赛。同时，在提弗里斯还有儿童自己建设的铁路，这铁路的工作人员，从工人以至司机完全由儿童们自己来充任。这里的一切需要器材，也都是由儿童制造供给的。
    除了这些不同的儿童课外活动组织以外，尚有儿童剧院和儿童电影院之设，它们都是专为少年儿童服务的，是儿童们的娱乐场所。在这里有五十个儿童剧院和好几十个电影院，这些剧院和电影院都专门上演一些为儿童看的戏或影片；而且有的戏剧是由儿童们亲自来饰演，这在儿童智慧和天才的启发上起着很大的作用，且已获致了良好的效果。
    在苏联，儿童到处可以受到教育，这是已经确立的事实。他们不但能在课室里得到教育，而且也能在他们的课外活动里得到教育，这教育是活的教育、真实的教育。（译自《苏联建设》第四期）。
