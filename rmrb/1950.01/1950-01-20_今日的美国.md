Today's America:

On one hand, an economic crisis is unfolding, and the reactionary ruling class is increasingly moving towards fascism. On the other hand, the people have awakened, organized, and are taking action under the leadership of the Communist Party – this is today's America.

Since the 20th century, the United States has consistently held the top position in industrial productivity among capitalist countries. In 1939, the total industrial production of the United States accounted for 48% of the total industrial production of the capitalist world. During World War II, the productivity of the United States increased dramatically. After the war, the total industrial output of the United States now accounts for 70% of the total industrial production of the capitalist world. Facing such enormous productivity, the domestic and foreign markets of the United States are shrinking day by day. Due to the end of the war, the market for munitions naturally shrank considerably. The more or less recovery of productivity in capitalist countries after the war also inevitably reduced the need for American goods. National liberation struggles are underway in colonies and semi-colonies, and the markets in these places are naturally shrinking as well. In addition, the installation of new machinery necessary for converting war industries back to peacetime industries has reached saturation. The little savings accumulated by the American people during the war due to purchasing restrictions have also been exhausted in the period after the war. All the conditions that maintained the false post-war "prosperity" have disappeared, and the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production under the monopoly capitalist system has become increasingly acute, resulting in the unfolding of the American economic crisis.

The post-war American economic crisis began with the stock market crash at the end of September 1946, and its full-scale development began in November 1948. Looking at the production index, the post-war peak was in October 1948, and it has been declining ever since. From November 1948 to July 1949, it decreased by 18%. Specifically, the steel industry decreased by 28%, the machinery industry decreased by 21%, and the non-ferrous metal industry decreased by 32%. In August and September, the textile and other industries rebounded somewhat, and bourgeois scholars boasted that the economic crisis was over. In fact, this rebound was seasonal. By October, production had fallen again by 18%, indicating that the economic crisis had not passed but continued to develop. From October 1948 to October 1949, total industrial production fell by 22%, while the production decline in the first year of the Great Depression of 1929 was only 15%, indicating the seriousness of today's American economic crisis. Another noteworthy fact is that the US government estimates that production will fall by another 10% next year.

Looking at the market: from October 1948 to October 1949, the retail trade volume of clothing fell by 20%, grain by 15%, hardware by 13%, and general merchandise by 11%. The total value of goods exported to foreign markets was 15 billion US dollars in 1947, which decreased to 12 billion US dollars in 1949, a decrease of 20%. Officials believe that it will decrease by another 20% by 1952.

The number of unemployed people in the United States has increased. According to official figures, it doubled from October 1948 to October 1949. It is generally estimated that the number of unemployed last year reached 14 million, of which 6 million were fully unemployed, and another 8 million were calculated from 10 million to 12 million partially unemployed. This does not include farmers who cannot live off the land due to capitalist exploitation. Experts estimate that this group will reach 4 million to 6 million in the next few years. Based on the aforementioned official estimate that production will fall by another 10% in 1950, plus the implementation of speed-up systems and the increase in worker productivity, the number of unemployed will inevitably continue to increase. Accompanying the increase in the number of unemployed is the reduction of workers' wages. From 1948 to 1949, workers' nominal wages had already decreased by 15%, and actual wages decreased even more than that. It is estimated that the minimum annual expenditure for a family of four in the United States is 4,000 US dollars. According to official estimates, 68% of families in the United States have an annual income of less than 4,000 US dollars, one-third of families have an annual income of about 2,000 US dollars, and one-sixth of families have an annual income of about 1,000 US dollars.

What methods does the ruling class use to "save" this unsalvageable economic crisis? The main method is to shift the disaster of the economic crisis onto the working people:

1.  Expand armaments. Looking at the national budget, direct and indirect military expenditures in 1950 were 42.4 billion yuan, accounting for 71% of the budget. The burden of taxes mainly falls on the working people.
2.  Curtail production. Many factories have changed from six working days a week to three working days a week. Congress passed a bill to reduce wheat planting land by 17% from 1949 to 1950.
3.  Expand foreign markets. This is one of the purposes of the Marshall Plan. One of the main functions of Truman's Point Four Program is to give a shot in the arm to the shrinking foreign market.

It is worth noting that some methods, after being adopted, have not prevented the development of the crisis, but have instead deepened it.

Although the development of the current American economic crisis is not in the same form as in 1929, the depth and severity of the crisis will inevitably exceed that of 1929.

Under such an economic crisis, the American people, first of all, struggle against reactionary rule for survival. Strikes are continuous, and a new united front party—the Progressive Party—participates in the political struggle. The movement for democracy and survival has been vigorously launched. In order to preserve their exploiting position as the class struggle intensifies, the reactionary rulers tear off the hypocritical cloak of democracy, intensify their reactionary measures, and move towards the path of fascism.

The American rulers fully represent the interests of the monopoly capitalists. Truman is particularly enthusiastic about Middle Eastern oil for the benefit of his backer, Rockefeller. In its policies towards Germany and Japan, Truman listens to DuPont and Morgan. Secretary of Defense Johnson is the former director of Walt Aircraft Manufacturing Company. High Commissioner to Germany McCloy is the former president of the World Bank. Chief of the Ordnance Bureau Howard is the former manager of the Chicago Coal Company. Similar examples are too numerous to mention. The collusion between the military and monopoly capital is a particularly noteworthy development during World War II and in the years after the war, and it is the foundation for the fascistization of the United States.

The reactionary ruling class cruelly suppresses the labor movement and splits the labor movement. In 1947, twenty people organizing unions in the South by the CIO were beaten up, and workers were shot. The reactionary leaders of the CIO, who were bought off by the ruling class, expelled two progressive unions (Electrical Workers Union, Agricultural Machinery Workers Union) in 1949 and appointed three committees to investigate ten other progressive unions (Mining, Smelting and Allied Workers Union, Public Utility Workers Union, Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, Fur and Leather Workers Union, Food, Tobacco, Agricultural and Allied Workers Union, United Office and Professional Workers of America, Furniture Workers Union, Fishermen and Allied Workers Union, United Public Workers, Marine Cooks and Stewards Union) in preparation for finding excuses to expel them. Illegally interrogating eleven leaders of the American Communist Party and progressive labor leader Bridges. Last December, the "Un-American Activities Investigation Committee" also said that it would subpoena Wallace on the grounds that Wallace "might" have transported atomic materials to the Soviet Union during the war. Implementing the Taft-Hartley Act, forcing workers joining unions to swear that they are not communists. Implementing "loyalty" investigations of government civil servants, arbitrarily dismissing civil servants whom the rulers believe to be suspected of being communists. The dismissed civil servants cannot see the plaintiffs, nor can they see the charges.

Under such reactionary rule, the people have not succumbed. They are fighting even more heroically. The famous steel workers' strike of 1949 was suppressed by the reactionary union leader and CIO Chairman Murray (he is also the chairman of the Steel Workers Union), but the workers still insisted on the demand for wage increases. The fighting spirit could not be suppressed by Murray, and Murray had no choice but to issue a strike order. This shows that the workers have gradually realized that the reactionary leaders of the union are in cahoots with the ruling class, and that the only way to solve their own problems is to rely on their own strength. This is a great victory.

The united front Progressive Party, in the last election, contributed to defeating the Republican Party that big capitalists wanted to put on the government throne. After the election, the Progressive Party's influence among the American people has gradually expanded. In 1948, the Progressive Party's newspaper had 5,000 subscribers, and in 1949 it increased sharply to 125,000. They are preparing to actively participate in this year's parliamentary elections.

As the leader of the democratic forces in the United States, the Communist Party leads the economic and political struggles of the workers, and launches the American people's movement for human rights, opposition to racial discrimination, and opposition to war, etc.

The general public does not have a good impression of the reactionaries. They especially hate those who openly clamor for war. In 1948, Truman won by deceiving the people with various hypocritical progressive promises during the election. Now, some people in the Republican Party also feel that excessive exposure of a too hideous face cannot appear among the people, and they are actively advocating reorganizing the Republican Party. This proves that the broad masses of the American people are opposed to battle cries.

Of course, we also do not deny that there are still some shortcomings in the democratic forces in the United States today: for example, there are not enough organized and conscious workers. The number of workers eligible to join American unions is about 30 million, but only 16 million have joined unions. In heavy industry, workers participating in unions only account for 80%, while in light industry they only account for 40%, and in the southern states even fewer workers participate in unions. In addition, the leadership of the unions is still in the hands of reactionary union scabs, and progressive unions are still in the minority. These all hinder the economic and political struggles of the working class. More importantly, the influence of social democratic opportunism still poisons the American people and American workers today. They are paralyzing the workers, making them harbor illusions about capitalism, neglecting the importance of political struggle, and neglecting the necessity of independent organization. Overcoming the influence of social democracy and the poison of economism is the most urgent task for the progressive forces in the United States.

The victory of the Chinese people on the East Asian continent will inspire the working people of America today. With the continued expansion of the economic crisis, the American working class will further break away from the influence of opportunism, will raise their class consciousness, and will fight more heroically to overthrow the reactionary rule of monopoly capital!

    今日的美国
    杨华
    一方面，经济危机正在展开，反动的统治阶级日益走向法西斯的道路；另一面，人民已经觉醒，在共产党的领导下组织起来，行动起来——这就是今天的美国。
    二十世纪以来，在资本主义国家中，美国的工业生产力始终占着第一位，一九三九年美国的工业总生产量已占资本主义世界总产量的百分之四十八，第二次世界大战期间，美国的生产力更得到了极大的提高。战争结束后，现在美国的工业总产量占资本主义世界总产量的百分之七十。面对着这样庞大的生产力，美国的国内外市场却是一天天地缩小。由于战争的结束，军火的市场自然缩小了许多，战后资本主义各国生产力或多或少地恢复，也必然减少对美货的需要，殖民地半殖民地正在进行着民族解放斗争，在这些地方的市场，自然也跟着缩小。再加上把战争工业恢复到平时工业所必需的新机器的添设，已达到饱和点，美国人民在战时因购买限制而积蓄的一点存款，在战后一段时间内，也已消耗殆尽，一切维持着假象的战后“繁荣”的条件都已经消失了，独占资本主义制度下的生产力与生产关系的矛盾便日益尖锐化，结果便是美国经济危机的展开。
    战后的美国经济危机开始于一九四六年九月底的股票大跌，其全面展开则在一九四八年十一月。从生产指数来看，战后的最高峰是在一九四八年十月，从此便是一直下降。从一九四八年十一月至一九四九年七月降低了百分之十八。具体地来看，钢铁工业降低百分之二十八，机器工业降低百分之二十一，非铁金属业降低百分之三十二。八月、九月纺织等业又有些回涨，资产阶级的学者便吹嘘着经济危机已经过去。其实这次的回涨是季节性的。到十月产量又下跌了百分之十八，这说明经济危机不但没有成为过去，而是继续发展下去。从一九四八年十月到一九四九年十月工业生产总共跌落了百分之二十二，而一九二九年大危机头一年的生产下降只不过百分之十五，这说明今天的美国经济危机之严重性。还有一件值得注意的事：美国官方估计明年生产还要下跌百分之十。
    再从市场上来看：自一九四八年十月至一九四九年十月服装零售贸易量下跌百分之二十，粮食下跌百分之十五，五金下跌百分之十三，一般商品下跌百分之十一。输出国外市场的货物总值在一九四七年为一百五十亿美元，一九四九年减至一百二十亿美元，即是减少了百分之二十，官方认为到一九五二年还要少百分之二十。
    美国失业人数是增加了。根据官方数字自一九四八年十月至一九四九年十月增加了一倍。一般的估计去年的失业人数达一千四百万，其中六百万系全部失业，另外八百万是以一千至一千二百万部分失业者折算。这里还不包括因受资本主义剥削脱离土地无法生活的农民，据专家估计，这一批人数将在数年内达四百万至六百万。依据前述官方的估计一九五○年生产还要下降百分之十，再加上赶快制度的执行，工人劳动率的提高，失业人数还必然是继续增加。伴随着失业人数的增加，是工人的工资减低。从一九四八年到一九四九年工人的名义工资即已降低百分之十五，而实际工资比这还要降低得多。有人估计在美国四口之家一年的最低用费是四千元，依据官方估计，全美百分之六十八的家庭每年收入在四千元以下，三分之一的家庭每年收入在二千元左右，六分之一的家庭每年收入在一千元左右。
    统治阶级用什么方法来“挽救”这不可挽救的经济危机呢？主要的是把经济危机的灾难转嫁到劳苦人民身上去：
    一、扩张军备，从国家预算中看，一九五○年直接间接有关军事的用费为四百二十四亿元，占预算百分之七十一。租税负担主要是落在劳动人民身上。
    二、紧缩生产，许多工场由每周六个工作日，改到每周三个工作日。国会通过了一个法案，一九四九年至一九五○年种麦地要减少百分之十七。
    三、扩张国外市场，这便是马歇尔计划的目的之一。杜鲁门的第四点计划的主要作用之一，也在于给日益萎缩的国外市场打一支强心针。
    值得注意的是，有些方法采用之后，并没有阻止危机的发展，它反而加深了危机。
    目前美国经济危机的发展，虽不是如一九二九年那样的形态，但是危机的深度及其严重性，将必然超过一九二九年。
    在这样的经济危机之下的美国人民，首先为了求生存，向反动统治进行斗争。罢工的事件连续不断，一个新的统一阵线的政党——进步党参加了政治斗争，争民主争生存的运动已蓬勃展开。反动统治者为了保存其剥削的地位，在阶级斗争愈益激烈之际，扯掉了虚伪的民主外衣，加紧其反动措施，走向法西斯的道路。
    美国执政者完全代表着独占资本家的利益。杜鲁门为着后台老板洛克菲洛的利益，对中东的石油便显得分外热心。在对德对日政策上，杜鲁门则听命于杜邦、摩根。国防部长詹逊是前任的瓦尔替飞机制造公司的董事。驻德高级专员麦克洛埃是前任的世界银行行长。军火局局长荷华德是前任芝加哥煤矿公司经理。类似的例子，真是举不胜举。军人与独占资本的勾结，这是在第二次世界大战期间以及战后的年月中特别值得注意的发展，这是美国走向法西斯化的基础。
    反动统治阶级残酷地镇压工人运动，分裂工人运动。一九四七年产联在南方有二十个组织工会的人被打伤，工人被枪击。为统治阶级所收买了的产联反动领导者，于一九四九年，开除了两个进步工会（电气工人工会，农业机器工人工会），并指定了三个委员会调查其他十个进步工会（冶矿业工会，公共事业工会，码头工人工会，毛革工人工会，食品烟草工会，职业与自由职业者工会，家具工会，渔业工会，邮电交通工会，海上厨师工会），准备找寻借口开除它们。非法审讯十一位美共领袖和进步工人领袖布利治。去年十二月间“非美活动调查委员会”还说将要传讯华莱士，理由是华莱士有“可能”在战时将原子材料运往苏联。实行塔夫脱——哈特莱法案，迫令参加工会的工人宣誓表示不是共产党员。实行政府公务员“忠诚”调查，任意开除统治者认为有共产党嫌疑的公务员，被撤职的公务员看不到原告，也看不到状词。
    在这样的反动统治下的人民，并没有屈服。他们更英勇地斗争着。一九四九年著名的钢铁工人大罢工，受反动工会领袖产联主席莫莱的压制（他也是钢铁工人工会的主席），但工人依然坚持增资的要求，斗争的情绪非莫莱所能压住，莫莱才不得已发出罢工的命令。这说明工人已逐渐认识了工会反动领袖与统治阶级一鼻孔子出气，要解决自己的问题只有靠自己的力量，这是一个极大的胜利。
    统一战线的进步党，在上次大选中的贡献，就是打败了大资本家所想拥上政府宝位的共和党；大选以后，进步党在美国人民中的影响，也逐渐扩大。一九四八年进步党报纸的订户为五千份，一九四九年则遽增至十二万五千份。他们正准备着积极参加今年的议会选举。
    作为美国民主势力的领袖的共产党，领导着工人的经济斗争和政治斗争，发动着美国广大人民争取人权运动、反对种族歧视、反对战争等等。
    一般人民对于反动者，都是不抱好感的。他们尤其痛恨那些公开叫嚣战争的人们。一九四八年杜鲁门便是在竞选时以各种虚伪的进步的诺言来欺骗人民而得胜的。现在，共和党中的某些人，也觉得过度暴露太狰狞的面目，不能在人民中出现，便又积极倡导改组共和党。这证明美国广大人民是反对战斗叫嚣的。
    当然，我们也不否认，在今天的美国民主力量方面，还存在些缺点：比如说，有组织的觉悟的工人还不够多，有资格参加美国工会的工人数目约为三千万，而参加了工会的只有一千六百万。在重工业中参加工会的工人只占百分之八十，而在轻工业中只占百分之四十，在南方各州参加工会的工人更少。此外工会的领导权，还都落在反动的工贼手中，进步工会还是少数。这些都妨害着工人阶级的经济斗争与政治斗争。更为重要的是社会民主党机会主义的影响还毒害着今天的美国人民、美国工人。他们正在麻痹工人，使他们对资本主义抱着幻想，忽视政治斗争的重要，忽视独立组织的必要。克服社会民主党的影响和经济主义的流毒，对于美国的进步势力来说，实是最为迫切的事。
    中国人民在东亚大陆上的胜利，将会鼓舞今天的美国劳动人民。随着经济危机之继续扩展，美国工人阶级将更摆脱机会主义的影响，将提高他们的阶级觉悟，将更英勇地为打倒反动的独占资本的统治而奋斗！
