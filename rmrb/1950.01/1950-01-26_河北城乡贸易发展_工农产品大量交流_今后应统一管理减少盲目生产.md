    Hebei's Urban-Rural Trade Develops
    Large-Scale Exchange of Industrial and Agricultural Products
    Unified Management Should Be Implemented in the Future to Reduce Blind Production
    [This Newspaper Reports] Since the beginning of winter, agricultural products from various parts of Hebei Province have been flowing into cities, and urban industrial products have also been supplied to rural areas in large quantities. By the end of November last year, the North China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company alone had purchased more than 97 million catties of cotton. The amount purchased by merchants also exceeded 19 million catties. Other specialized companies also actively purchased industrial raw materials and helped farmers sell their special products. The four native product companies in Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Handan, and Anguo have already sold 36.58 million catties of medicinal materials. In remote mountainous areas where cooperatives have not been established, the native product companies entrusted legitimate merchants and peddlers to make purchases. The pig bristle branches in Baoding and Shijiazhuang purchased a total of 77,300 catties of pig bristles, and the oil company purchased 10 million catties of peanuts. In order to expand the sales scope, stalls and stations have also been established in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Mongolia, Suiyuan, and Chahar, and exchange contracts have been signed with local public and private enterprises. In the past few months, more than 400,000 reed mats, 1.5 million bolts of homespun cloth, 10 million catties of sea salt, and 16 million catties of mirabilite have been sold. In addition, various public and private enterprises and cooperatives have also supplied farmers with a lot of daily necessities. The Shijiazhuang (August to November) and Baoding (October to November) Coal and Iron Companies supplied the masses with more than 180,000 tons of coal. The Baoding Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch supplied the masses with 200,055 pieces of fine yarn in two months, while the Tangshan and Linqing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branches and the Provincial Cooperative Federation supplied them in one month.

    From the above material exchanges, we can see the leading role of the state-owned economy. The transportation and exchange of large quantities of cotton, mountain products, grain, and urban industrial products are mostly handled by specialized companies in various places. The mountain products and medicinal materials purchased by the Shijiazhuang Native Products Company through cooperatives account for more than 70% of the company's total business volume. The Hebei Branch of the People's Bank of China increased the total amount of remittances eightfold from August to October; the number of remittance routes increased from 54 to 78. The total amount of remittances in three months was 2.9 billion, of which 86% were remitted to the five major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou, mostly to exchange for grain, cloth, and daily necessities.

    The main problems in material exchange in the province at present are, first, to gradually realize unified management of exports throughout the province, so as to reduce the blindness of sideline production and enhance planning. Secondly, how to ensure that the materials sold by various companies can reach the disaster victims who lack these things is a problem that should be solved by various places. The main way to solve this problem is to vigorously lead the people in disaster areas to develop sideline production and increase the purchasing power of disaster victims. Organize transportation forces, and help the farmers in disaster areas export their special products and things that can be exported, even if it is a little bit, in exchange for raw materials for sideline production and daily necessities. In addition, state-owned enterprises should also solve the sales problem of peanuts well. Otherwise, it will affect the development of the oil extraction industry. In addition, various departments should also check the obstacles in material exchange, such as inconsistent tax and license management methods, and excessively high loading and unloading fees at some docks, which should be studied and resolved.

### 河北城乡贸易发展  工农产品大量交流  今后应统一管理减少盲目生产

    河北城乡贸易发展
    工农产品大量交流
    今后应统一管理减少盲目生产
    【本报讯】河北省入冬以来，各地农产品源源流入城市，城市的工业产品也大量供给了农村。到去年十一月底，只华北花纱布公司就收买了棉花九千七百余万斤。商人收买的数量，也有一千九百多万斤。其余别的专业公司，也积极收买工业原料，和帮助农民推销特产品。唐山、石家庄、邯郸、安国四个土产公司，已经推销了药材三千六百五十八万斤。没有建立起合作社的偏僻山地，由土产公司委托正当商人和小贩去收买。保定和石家庄的猪鬃分公司，共收买了猪鬃七万七千三百斤，油脂公司收买了花生一千万斤。为了扩大推销面，还在北京、天津、沈阳、蒙古、绥远、察哈尔等地，建立了摊、站，并和当地的公私营企业部门订立了交换合同。几个月以来，共推销出四十余万领席子，一百五十万匹土布，一千万斤海盐，一千六百万斤皮硝。另外，各公私营企业和合作社，也供给了农民不少生活资料。石家庄（八月到十一月）、保定（十月到十一月）两个煤铁公司，曾供给了群众十八万多吨煤。保定花纱布分公司在两个月中，唐山、临清花纱布分公司和省合作总社，在一个月中，共供给群众细纱二十万零五十五块。
    从以上物资交流中，即可看出国营经济的领导作用。大宗的棉花、山货、粮食和城市工业品的调运交换，多是各地专业公司办理的。石家庄土产公司通过合作社收买的山货药材，就占公司经营总数目的百分之七十多。人民银行河北分行，从八月到十月，汇款总数增加了八倍；汇路由五十四条增到七十八条。三个月汇款总数共二十九亿，其中汇到北京、天津、张家口等五大城市的就占百分之八十六，大多是换回粮食、纱布和日用品。
    全省目前在物资交流中的主要问题，首先应逐渐实现全省统一管理输出，以减少副业生产的盲目性，增强计划性。其次如何使各公司卖出的物资，能落到缺乏这些东西的灾民手里，这是各地应注意解决的问题。解决这个问题的主要办法，是以大力领导灾区人民开展副业生产，提高灾民的购买力。组织运输力量，把灾区农民的特产，和可以输出的东西，即便是一点一滴，也要帮助他们输出，换回副业生产原料和生活必需品。另外国营企业，还应很好的解决花生的销路问题。不然就会影响榨油业的开展。此外各部门还要检查物资交流中的障碍，如税收和证照管理办法不统一，有的码头上装卸货脚价过高，都应研究解决。
