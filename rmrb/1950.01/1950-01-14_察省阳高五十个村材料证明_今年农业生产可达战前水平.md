    Materials from Fifty Villages in Yanggao, Chahar Province, Prove This Year's Agricultural Production Can Reach Pre-War Levels
    [Our Dispatch] After Bo Yibo, Secretary of the North China Bureau of the CCP, raised the issue of restoring agricultural production to pre-war levels within two years, leaders at all levels in Chahar Province paid close attention and made considerable efforts in practical work (such as autumn plowing: reaching 96% in Chahar South, over 85% in Yanbei, and 70% in Chahar North). However, due to a lack of specific survey materials, it was difficult to confirm whether this year could indeed restore pre-war levels, and cadres generally remained unclear on this issue. To this end, the Research Office of the Chahar Provincial Committee of the CCP conducted a survey of fifty villages during the Yanggao People's Representative Conference. This material may deviate from the actual situation, as it is based solely on the statements of village representatives, but it is relatively close to the truth as a general material. According to the survey materials from the fifty villages in Yanggao, it can be seen that these villages, except for livestock, sheep, and vehicles, which have not yet been restored to pre-war levels, can catch up with pre-war levels in other aspects such as farm tools, fertilizers, sowing area, labor force, and output. This material is only a general calculation and estimate by village representatives. If leadership and other conditions are added, such as water conservancy projects, prevention and control of pests and diseases, and promotion of improved varieties, especially the great achievements of last year's autumn plowing, then it is estimated that areas like Yanggao have the potential to restore to pre-war levels. The survey is written below:

    I. A total of fifty villages were surveyed (six old area, semi-old area villages, the rest are new areas) with 10,190 households, an average of 226.63 households per village. The total population is 44,508 people (the number of households and population are calculated based on forty-five villages because the figures for five villages are missing; the following other figures are all materials from fifty villages).

    II. In terms of fertilizer: The average application of fertilizer per mu before the war was 7.5 dan, the average last year was 5.7 dan, and this year it can be increased to 8 dan. Thus, this year is 2.3 dan higher than last year, and 0.5 dan higher than before the war.

    III. In terms of farm tools: The average number of farm tools per household before the war was 3.8 pieces (referring to shovels, hoes, etc.), last year it was 3.3 pieces, and this year it can be increased to 4.7 pieces. This year is 1.4 pieces higher than last year, and 0.9 pieces higher than before the war.

    IV. Sowing area: Before the war, the total was 177,527 mu, an average of 3550.54 mu per village. Last year, the total was 175,947 mu, an average of 3518.94 mu per village. This year, the total is 193,679 mu, an average of 3873.58 mu per village. This year's total cultivated area can be increased by 17,732 mu compared to last year, with an average increase of 354.64 mu per village. Compared to pre-war, the total cultivated area can be increased by 16,152 mu, with an average increase of 323.04 mu per village.

    V. In terms of livestock: Before the war, there were a total of 2,447 heads of livestock, an average of 48.94 heads per village. Last year, there were 1,706 heads, an average of 34.12 heads per village. This year, it can be increased to 2,046 heads, an average of 40.92 heads per village. This year's total can be increased by 340 heads compared to last year, an average increase of 6.8 heads per village, but it is still 401 heads short of pre-war levels, an average shortage of 8.02 heads per village.

    VI. In terms of labor: Before the war, there were a total of 13,219 laborers, an average of 264.38 per village. Last year, there were a total of 14,660 laborers, an average of 293.2 per village. This year, it can be increased to 15,846 laborers, an average of 316.92 per village. This year's total can be increased by 1,186 laborers compared to last year, an average increase of 23.72 per village, and 2,627 laborers more than before the war, an average increase of 52.54 per village (the increase in labor is mainly due to the large number of women participating in labor).

    VII. In terms of sheep raising: Before the war, there were a total of 10,958 sheep, an average of 219.6 sheep per village. Last year, there were a total of 6,962 sheep, an average of 139.24 sheep per village. This year, it can be increased to 10,211 sheep, an average of 204.22 sheep per village. This year's total can be increased by 3,249 sheep compared to last year, an average increase of 64.98 sheep per village, but it is still 747 sheep short of pre-war levels, an average shortage of 15.38 sheep per village.

    VIII. In terms of pig raising: Before the war, there were 3,440 pigs, an average of 68.8 pigs per village. Last year, there were a total of 3,436 pigs, an average of 68.72 pigs per village. This year, it can be increased to 4,408 pigs, an average of 88.16 pigs per village. This year's total can be increased by 872 pigs compared to last year, an average increase of 19.44 pigs per village, and 868 pigs more than before the war, an average increase of 19.36 pigs per village.

    IX. In terms of vehicles: Before the war, there were a total of 780 vehicles, an average of 15.6 vehicles per village. Last year, there were 566 vehicles, an average of 11.32 vehicles per village. This year, it can be increased to 681 vehicles, an average of 13.62 vehicles per village. This year's total can be increased by 115 vehicles compared to last year, an average increase of 2.3 vehicles per village, but it is still 99 vehicles short of pre-war levels, an average shortage of 1.98 vehicles per village.

    X. In terms of output: Before the war, the average per mu in fifty villages was 4.615 shi dou. Last year it was 3.242 shi dou, and this year it is estimated that the average per mu can be increased to 4.662 shi dou.

    察省阳高五十个村材料证明
    今年农业生产可达战前水平
    【本报讯】自中共华北局书记薄一波提出二年内恢复战前农业生产水平问题之后，察省各级领导即引起了高度注意，而且在实际工作中亦做了不少的努力（如秋耕：察南达百分之九十六，雁北达百分之八十五以上，察北亦达百分之七十等）。但由于缺乏具体调查材料，很难证实究竟今年能否恢复战前水平，而且一般干部对这个问题也很模糊。为此中共察哈尔省委研究室即曾在阳高人民代表会上进行了五十个村的调查。这个材料因仅据各村代表所谈，可能与实际情况还有距离，但当作个一般材料来看是比较接近于真实的。根据阳高五十个村的调查材料，可以看出这些村庄今年除牲畜、羊群和车辆还不能恢复到战前水平外，其他如农具、肥料、播种面积、劳动力、产量等都可赶上战前水平。这个材料只是村代表一般的计算和估计，如果再加上领导上及其他各方面的条件，如兴修水利，防除病虫害，推广优良品种等，特别是去年秋耕的伟大成绩，那么像阳高这样地区，估计是有可能恢复战前水平的。兹将调查情况写在下面：
    一、共调查五十个村（六个老区、半老区村庄，其它都是新区）一○、一九○户，每村平均户数二二六·六三户。总人口四四、五○八人（户数、人口因缺五村数字，故总数是按四十五村计算的，以下其它数字则都是五十个村的材料）。
    二、在肥料方面：战前每亩平均施肥七·五担，去年每亩平均是五·七担，今年可增至八担，这样今年就比去年增加二·三担，比战前增加○·五担。
    三、农具方面：战前每户平均三·八件（指锨、镐、锄等），去年是三·三件，今年可增至四·七件。今年比去年增加一·四件，比战前增加○·九件。
    四、播种面积：战前共一七七、五二七亩，每村平均三五五○·五四亩，去年共一七五、九四七亩，每村平均三五一八·九四亩，今年共一九三、六七九亩，每村平均三八七三·五八亩，今年比去年可增总耕地面积一七、七三二亩，每村平均增加三五四·六四亩，比战前可增加总耕地面积一六、一五二亩，每村平均增加三二三·○四亩。
    五、牲畜方面：战前共有牲畜二、四四七头，每村平均四八·九四头，去年一、七○六头，每村平均三四·一二头，今年可增至二、○四六头，每村平均四○·九二头，今年比去年共可增三四○头，每村平均增六·八头，但较战前还差四○一头，每村平均差八·○二头。
    六、劳动力方面：战前共一三、二一九个，每村平均二六四·三八个，去年共一四、六六○个，每村平均二九三·二个，今年可增至一五、八四六个，每村平均三一六·九二个，今年比去年共可增一、一八六个，每村平均增二三·七二个，比战前增加二、六二七个，每村平均增加五二·五四个（劳动力的增加主要因妇女大量参加劳动）。
    七、养羊方面：战前共有羊一○、九五八只，每村平均二一九·六只，去年共羊六九六二只，每村羊平均一三九·二四只，今年可增至一○、二一一只。每村平均二○四·二二只，今年比去年共可增羊三、二四九只，每村平均增六四·九八只，但较战前还差七四七只，每村平均差一五·三八只。
    八、养猪方面：战前三、四四○口，每村平均六八·八口，去年共三、四三六口，每村平均六八·七二口，今年可增至四、四○八口，每村平均八八·一六口，今年比去年可增八七二口，每村平均增一九·四四口，比战前增八六八口，每村平均增加一九·三六口。
    九、车辆方面：战前共有七八○辆，每村平均一五·六辆，去年共五六六辆，每村平均一一·三二辆，今年可增至六八一辆，每村平均一三·六二辆，今年比去年增加一一五辆，每村平均增二·三辆，但较战前还差九九辆，每村平均差一·九八辆。
    十、在产量方面：战前五十个村每亩平均四·六一五市斗，去年三·二四二市斗，今年估计每亩可增至四·六六二市斗。
