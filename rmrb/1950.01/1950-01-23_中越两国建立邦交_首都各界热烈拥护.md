China and Vietnam Establish Diplomatic Relations
Enthusiastic Support from All Sectors in the Capital
[Beijing News] Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, telegraphed a reply to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, expressing willingness to establish diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which was warmly supported by people from all walks of life in the capital. Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, said: "The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a major event of great historical significance. This is good news for all peace-loving and democratic countries and peoples, because the people of China and Vietnam will unite even further and contribute more to the cause of safeguarding world peace and democracy, and it will play a greater role in the national liberation movement in Southeast Asia. However, the United States and other imperialists will tremble with fear upon hearing this news, because it is a serious blow to their aggressive plots to invade Southeast Asia." Workers from the China People's Printing Factory, Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, Railway Engineering Brigade, Beijing Workers' School, and Dahua Pottery Company expressed their support for the central government's decision to establish diplomatic relations between China and Vietnam.

Chai Zemin, Director of the Beijing Farmers' Association Preparatory Committee, said: "The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Vietnam marks a new victory in the struggle for national liberation in the East and is a powerful encouragement to the struggle for liberation of the oppressed nations in Southeast Asia. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam and China belong to the great world democratic and peaceful camp, and the people of the two countries have long enjoyed a long-standing friendship. Of course, we firmly support the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Vietnam."

Liang Yiqiu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Beijing Education Workers' Union Preparatory Committee, said: "The Chinese and Vietnamese people originally had a friendship as close as brothers, but due to the instigation and isolation of the reactionary rulers of China and Western imperialists, the people of the two countries seemed somewhat estranged. Now the people of the two countries are joining hands again, which provides the greatest guarantee for the liberation of the East and world peace.

Gu Qizong, Chairman of the Beijing Student Federation, said: "The people of China and Vietnam have a traditional friendship in history, and they have also defeated domestic reactionaries aided by foreign imperialists and established people's countries. The close unity of the people of China and Vietnam has consolidated the victory of the people's democratic revolution and further encouraged the fighting will of the national liberation movement of the people of Southeast Asia. It will defeat all imperialist conspiracies and suppression and win the final victory."

Fu Huating, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Vietnam is not only a victory for the liberation struggle camp of the oppressed nations in Southeast Asia, but also a victory for the worldwide peace and democracy camp moving forward. Under the impact of the torrent of the people's strength around the world, the US and French imperialist front in Southeast Asia will be smashed to pieces!
[Reported from Zhangjiakou] People from all walks of life in Zhangjiakou unanimously support the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Vietnam. Sun Ming, Director of the Chahar Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, spoke on behalf of the workers of the province, saying: "This is a concrete manifestation of the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people, and it will shatter all imperialist aggressive plots in Southeast Asia." Shi Guozhen, a negotiating member of the Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Representative Conference, said: "The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Vietnam is a serious blow to the Kuomintang's remnant bandit gang's attempt to flee to Vietnam." The Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Student Federation, the Youth Federation, and others jointly issued a public statement, pointing out that the French Empire is still attempting to use the Kuomintang's remnant bandit gang to continue to oppose the Chinese and Vietnamese people. The United States and France also want to use Vietnam as a base for aggression in Southeast Asia. These reactionary behaviors will eventually suffer their own consequences due to the increasing strength of the Vietnamese people and the solidarity of the Chinese and Vietnamese people. Li Qixin, a worker at the Zhangjiakou Machine Factory, said: "The struggle of all the working people in Southeast Asia and the world is in one direction. We have been closely united, and any imperialist conspiracy will be completely smashed by us."

    【北京讯】我国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长电复越南民主共和国，愿与越南民主共和国建立外交关系，获得首都各界人民的热烈拥护。北京市总工会筹委会主任萧明说：我国与越南民主共和国建立邦交，这是一件具有伟大历史意义的大事。这对一切爱好和平民主的国家和人民都是一个喜讯，因为中越两国人民将会更进一步的团结起来，为保卫世界和平民主事业贡献更大的力量，对东南亚的民族解放运动将会起其更大的作用。但是美国及其它帝国主义听到这个消息，则会怕得发抖，因为这给它们侵略东南亚的侵略阴谋是一个严重的打击。中国人民印刷厂、北京电信局、铁路工程大队、北京市职工学校和大华窑业公司等职工，纷纷表示拥护中央政府建立中越邦交的决策。
    北京农会筹委会主任柴泽民说：“中越两国建立外交关系，标志着东方民族解放斗争的新胜利，对东南亚各被压迫民族解放斗争，是一个强大的鼓舞。越南民主共和国和中国都属于伟大的世界民主和平阵营，而且两国人民早已存在着悠久的友谊，我们当然坚决拥护中越建立邦交。”
    北京教育工作者工会筹委会副秘书长梁以俅说：“中国人民与越南人民原有亲如手足的友谊，中间因为受了中国反动统治者及西方帝国主义者的挑拨与隔绝，使两国人民似乎疏远了些。如今两国人民又携手并进，这对东方的解放与世界和平，都有了最大的保证。
    北京学联主席古奇踪说：“中越两国人民在历史上有传统的友谊，又同样战胜了受外国帝国主义援助的国内反动派，建立了人民的国家。中越两国人民的亲密团结，巩固了人民民主革命的胜利，更鼓舞了东南亚人民民族解放运动的斗争意志，它将战胜一切帝国主义的阴谋与镇压，获得最后的胜利。”
    工商联合会筹备委员会主任委员傅华亭说：中越建立了外交关系，不仅是东南亚各被压迫民族解放斗争阵营的胜利，也是全世界和平民主阵营向前迈进一大步的斗争胜利，在全世界人民力量的巨流冲击下，美法帝国主义在东南亚的战线将被冲得粉碎！
    【本报张家口电】张家口各界人民一致拥护建立中越邦交。察省总工会主任孙明代表全省工人发表谈话称：这是中越人民永恒友谊的具体表现，它将粉碎一切帝国主义在东南亚的侵略阴谋。张市各界代表会协商委员史国珍说：中越邦交建立，这对国民党残余匪帮企图潜逃越南的阴谋，是一个严重的打击。青年团张市工委、市学联、青联等联合发表的公开声明中更一致指出了法帝仍然企图利用国民党残余匪帮继续反对中越人民，美、法又想以越南为东南亚侵略基地，这些反动行为，均将因为越南人民力量的日益壮大和中越人民的团结而自食其果。张家口机器厂工友李启新说：“全东南亚和世界劳动人民的斗争是一个方向，我们已经紧紧的团结起来，任何帝国主义的阴谋都将被我们彻底粉碎。”
