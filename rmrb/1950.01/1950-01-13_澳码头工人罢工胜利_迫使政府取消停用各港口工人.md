Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th. The struggle of Australian dockworkers has been victorious. According to a TASS dispatch from Sydney on the 11th: Dockworkers in the ports of Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, who began a strike on the 5th, resumed work on the 10th after forcing the Stevedoring Industry Board to cancel the suspension of many workers in these ports. At a mass meeting in Sydney, dockworkers declared that if the Stevedoring Industry Board stops workers' jobs, all dockworkers will strike again. The Australian Waterside Workers' Federation is continuing to negotiate with the Arbitration Court on several demands of the dockworkers to the shipping companies, including: providing workers with subsidies, guaranteeing a minimum number of shifts, and improving worker relief efforts.
