    Overcoming the Tendency to Neglect Spring Ploughing Preparation
    Wanquan Actively Delivers Manure and Dumps Sand
    Manure Delivery Nearly Completed in Wo'ergou Village
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Wanquan County People's Government of Chahar Province, according to instructions from the Provincial Government, examined the blindness in production organization and began to correct the tendency to neglect spring ploughing preparation. It immediately dispatched key cadres to various districts and villages for inspection, and now there has been a great change and achievements have been made. In Yao'ergou, in the Third District, of the 157 households, 80 percent have delivered 5,000 large carts of manure to the fields, and the manure delivery in the whole village is nearing completion. In Wujiazhuang, in the First District, 120 large carts of manure were hauled back from Zhangjiakou. Wu'erzhuang Village organized more than 20 people to carry manure from Zhangjiakou City. Some villages in the Fourth District began to dump sand (the county is close to the Yang River, and a layer of sand must be spread on the silty land before crops can grow). In Xinzhuan Village, Shangying Village, Taishi Village, Zhangjiafangzi and other sixteen villages in the Fifth District, more than 80 households have dumped 7,700 large carts of sand from December 24th of last year to January 3rd of this year. Thirty carts are used to spread one mu of land, totaling 300 mu of land. Guo Tingfu from Dongxinzhuang alone dumped sand and leveled more than 20 mu of land. Liugou Village in the Fourth District dumped sand and leveled 150 mu of land. Production has been organized for some families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, cadres, orphans, and widows. For example, Liu Laoqi in Wujiazhuang Village has no labor force but has a leather cart, so Zhang Deyi provides manpower to work with him to run to places outside the customs. Chen Fu from Penyao Village is a cripple and cannot do other work, so he was organized to knit wool and socks. Some purely consumption-based side businesses have mostly changed their line of work. For example, Guo Sheng and other two people from Shanfangpu in the Third District lost four taels of oil for every pound of oil they sold in a small oil mill, so they immediately switched to buying pig bristles and pig hair, and in less than ten days, they earned a large stone of millet in addition to their food expenses. People selling pancakes in the Eighth Beach and Shizhuangtun of the First District switched to picking up manure and selling white clay. Wujiazhuang Village in the First District carried out side-line production such as transportation and sales, selling white clay, weaving baskets, and picking up manure in Zhangjiakou City. By the end of December last year, more than 200 households had earned more than 12,000 jin of naked oats and 78 shi of millet. Currently, the whole county is actively carrying out activities such as collecting firewood, accumulating fertilizer, delivering manure, and dumping sand.

    克服忽视准备春耕偏向
    万全积极送粪倒沙
    窝儿沟全村粪快送完
    【本报讯】察哈尔万全县人民政府根据省府指示，检查了组织生产的盲目性，开始纠正忽视春耕准备等偏向。立即派主要干部分头到各区、村检查，现已有很大转变并收到成绩。三区窑儿沟一百五十七户，有百分之八十的户已送到地里粪达五千大车，全村粪快要送完。一区武家庄从张家口拉回大粪一百二十大车。吴儿庄村组织了二十多人去张市担大粪。四区部分村庄开始倒沙（该县靠近洋河淤泥地必须摊一层沙子才能长）。五区新庄屯、上营屯、太师庄、张家房子等十六个村，有八十多户，从去年十二月廿四日开始，到本月三日已倒沙七千七百大车，三十车摊铺一亩地，共铺地三百亩。东新庄郭廷富一人即倒沙铺平二十多亩地。四区柳沟村倒沙铺平一百五十亩地。对烈、军、干属、孤儿、寡妇部分已组织起生产。如武家庄村刘老七无劳动力，有一个皮车，张德义出人合套跑口外。盆窑村陈福是一个拐子，作不了别的活，组织起打毛线、织袜子。有些纯消耗性的副业大部转业。如三区膳房堡郭胜等二人，开小油坊卖一斤油赔四两，后立即转入收买猪鬃、猪毛，不到十天，除吃外即赚小米一大石。一区第八滩、石庄屯卖饼子的人，转入拾大粪、卖白土子。一区武家庄村进行运销、卖白土子、编筐子和到张市拾大粪等副业生产，算到去年十二月底，二百多户赚回莜面一万二千余斤。小米七十八石。目前全县正在积极进行打柴、积肥、送粪、倒沙。
