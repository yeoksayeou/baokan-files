    A Poet's View of Today's World
    By Steinley, translated by Fu Ying
    After visiting the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies, the great Latin American poet Neruda (Pablo Neruda) met with the American writer Steinley in Prague to talk about his impressions. This article is a report by Ms. Steinley.
    "The real atomic power in the world is in the Soviet Union; it is precisely in the Soviet Union that they are creating a new person, the Soviet person." This is what Neruda said. He spoke with me alone. This great poet from Chile had just arrived in Prague after visiting the Soviet Union and several People's Democracies and was staying for a few days at the author's home near Prague before heading to Mexico to attend a peace conference.
    "The most prominent feature of the Soviet Union as a whole is composure and calmness. The characteristic of the Soviet people is strength, possessing a silent force," Neruda continued.
    This was Neruda's first visit to the Soviet Union. He attended the Pushkin celebrations, visited many cities, studied many factories, and spoke freely with the people. "The whole country has become a temple of Pushkin," he said. "Never in history has a writer occupied such a position in national life. Pushkin's works are printed in millions of copies. In front of every cinema, every public building, and even in the countryside, there are markers commemorating Pushkin. Everywhere there are large posters, similar to American Coca-Cola advertisements, except they don't urge you to buy anything, but instead select excerpts from Pushkin's poems.
    "I saw Leningrad and Stalingrad," Neruda continued. "I visited the tractor factory in Leningrad, and production is proceeding exactly as it was before the war. The traces of the war have been completely eliminated. There is absolutely no indication of the destruction Leningrad suffered during the war. This is an unbelievably great achievement, a symbol of the immense vitality of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people.
    "Everywhere is crowded with people," Neruda said. "The concerts and ballet performances are the best in the world and are always full. The stores are also often crowded."
    "One of the things that moved me most during my trip was meeting hundreds of young people who had left Spain during the Spanish Civil War when they were still children!" he said. "They are mostly the sons and daughters of workers. At that time, they were only ten or twelve years old. Now they are highly promising specialists. The day I visited them, a twenty-two-year-old girl was receiving a degree in hydroelectric engineering and would be supervising the installation of a hydroelectric power station. Others are financial experts, agricultural technicians, economists, and various engineers. They have all obtained university degrees.
    "Most of these young people still have families in Spain and still receive letters from their families. These letters show that there is a wide gap between Fascism and Socialism. Some brothers live by shining shoes, some sisters work as domestic servants, and some brothers are agricultural laborers unable to find work. They are members of the same family, but some are under Franco's rule, and some are under a socialist system."
    The extraordinary development of cultural life in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies made a strong impression on Neruda. He said, "The position of writers in these countries is almost unimaginable to anyone coming from the Western world. For example, in Hungary. A writer wants to write a novel, he submits a plan for the book, and he can travel to the place he wants to write about."
    "In all the countries I have seen," he said, "life in Poland is the most epic. Without materials, they are rebuilding their city, inch by inch, from ruins and rubble. Rubble, stones, etc., are all pressed into new types of bricks. They painstakingly rebuilt the buildings destroyed by artillery fire. The old district of Warsaw, completely destroyed, was rebuilt according to the paintings of the great Italian painter Canaletto in the eighteenth century. Not an inch of land is left unplanted. What we see today is only seen in major periods of history.
    "The People's Democracies are rapidly moving towards a new life. The state provides the driving force for progress. Nothing can stop their progress. This is why those who want to stop their progress want war. But they will not succeed."
    Neruda emphasized the difference between the life he saw in the People's Democracies and the life in his own country, Chile, and other South American countries. He said, "I went to visit a Czech woman's family. It was a modern, beautiful apartment. The host who received me was a young mechanic, and he told me that he had never dreamed of living in such a house."
    "My country (Chile) is extremely rich," he continued, "but no worker can live like this. More than half of Chile's five million people do not eat meat. Nutrition is so deficient that the average height of the people is constantly decreasing."
    "When Acheson talks about freedom, he never mentions the tyranny in South America," he said. "Maintaining the power of these tyrants is in the interest of the forces represented by Acheson. These dictators are careful to keep their property safe in American banks. When they are overthrown, they fly to Miami. This is the classic pattern—the last payment."
    "When oil was discovered in southern Chile, the U.S. Export-Import Bank refused to help the Chilean government obtain the necessary machinery for exploitation. They said their money would only be lent to private mining companies."
    "Anaconda Copper Company pays its workers in the United States eight or ten dollars a day. In the Chilean copper mines, workers only get fifty cents a day.
    "For American companies, the biggest danger is wage increases. The struggle to increase wages is led by the Communist Party. This is why the imperialists' policy is to declare the Communist Party illegal and destroy it at all costs. This is why they are giving the most severe blows to those countries where the Communist Party is strongest, Chile, Brazil, and Cuba. The greatest oppression has been given to these countries. The imperialists hope that when the Communist Party is declared illegal, they will be able to drag these countries into their war plans."
    Despite these tyrannies and oppressions, Neruda believes that the reactionary forces in South America are weakening, not strengthening. "The truth is that the policy adopted by Chile has not succeeded after a year and a half," he said.
    He cited the situation in Lota as an example. Four thousand of the seventeen thousand workers there were fired from the mine and replaced by strike-breakers supplied by the Socialist Party and backward elements among the peasants. In three consecutive elections, the miners elected a man imprisoned in a concentration camp to be the leader of their union, and the majority of the members of the executive committee they elected were people designated by the government as communists.
    "The Chilean Communist Party is the backbone of the people's struggle," Neruda said. The Chilean Communist Party was founded by Lecabarón, the greatest people's leader on the South American continent. The people have never doubted its national character. When the General Secretary of the Communist Party died, 65,000 people attended the funeral. In his union, 140,000 people signed his memorial book. These are all failures for the imperialists.
    "Imperialism is doomed to failure in South America," Neruda concluded, "and the imperialists' war plans are also doomed to failure."

    一个诗人对今天世界的看法
    斯坦莱女士作福英译
    拉丁美洲伟大诗人奈路达（Pablo Neruda）访问了苏联及东欧人民民主国家之后，在布拉格会见美国女作家斯坦莱女士，畅谈他的观感。此文就是斯坦莱女士的报导。
    “世界上真正的原子的力量是在苏联；恰恰是在苏联，他们创造了新的人，苏维埃人。”这是奈路达说的话。他单独与我会谈。这位智利的伟大的诗人在访问了苏联与几个人民民主国家之后，刚到布拉格来，在作者的邻近布拉格的家里住几天，然后才前往墨西哥出席和平大会。
    “苏联全国的最显著的特点是沉着镇静。苏联人民的特点是富有力量，具有一股不声不响的力，”奈路达继续说。
    这是奈路达第一次访问苏联。他出席了普希金庆祝会，访问了好多城市，研究了许多工厂，自由地与人民谈话。“全国已变成了普希金的神庙，”他说。“在历史中，从来没有像给作家在国民生活中占这么样的地位。普希金的著作，印数以百万计。在每一个电戏院，每一座公共建筑的前面，甚至在乡间，都有纪念普希金的标记。随处都有大幅招贴，类似美国的可口可乐的广告，只是它们并不鼓动你买什么东西，而是选录普希金的诗。
    “我看了列宁格勒与斯大林格勒，”奈路达继续说。“我参观了列宁格勒的拖拉机厂，生产进行得和战前一模一样。战争的痕迹已完全消灭。已完全没有迹象可以看出列宁格勒在战时所遭受的破坏。这是一令人难以置信的伟大成就，是苏联和苏维埃人民的浩大活力的象征。
    “到处都是人满，”奈路达说。“音乐会和巴莱舞是世界最好的，总是客满。商店也常是人满。”
    “我在旅行中最使我感动的事情之一，就是我遇见了几百个青年，在西班牙内战时看他们离开西班牙，他们还是幼童呢！”他说：“他们大都是工人的儿子和女儿。那时他们才十岁、十二岁。现在他们是有非常前途的专门人材。我往访他们的那一天，有一位二十二岁的女青年，接受水力电气工程师的学位，她将监督安设水电站。其他的人，有的是财政专家，有的是农业技师，有的是经济学家，还有各种的工程师。他们全都获得大学学位。
    “这些青年大都还有家庭在西班牙，还接到家庭寄来的信。这些信件显示出法西斯主义与社会主义之间是隔开着很广的鸿沟。有的兄弟靠擦鞋为生，有的姊妹当家庭仆役，有的兄弟是农业劳动者找不到工做。他们是同一个家庭的成员，不同的是有的在佛朗哥统治之下，有的是在社会主义制度下。”
    苏联和人民民主国家中的文化生活之非常的发展，给奈路达很强烈的印象。他说：“作家在这些国家中的地位，是从西方世界来的任何人所几乎不能想象的。比如说在匈牙利吧。一个作家想要写一本小说，他提出了该书的计划，就可以旅行到他所要写的那个地方去了。”
    “在我所看到的一切国家中，”他说：“波兰的生活是最富史诗意味的了。没有什么材料，他们从断垣残壁，一分一寸地，重建他们的城市。瓦砾、石头等都压成新型的砖。辛辛苦苦地把被炮火所毁的建筑重新建造。华沙的老区，全部被毁，每一间房屋都照着意大利大画家坎那勒托在十八世纪所画的图画重造。没有寸地不种植。今天所看到的情形，是只在历史中重大时期才能看见的。
    “人民民主国家很迅速地朝向着新的生活前进。国家给予进步的动力。没有什么东西能够阻挡它们的进步。那些要阻挡它们的进步之人们为什么要战争，其故即在于此。但他们是不会成功的。”
    奈路达强调他在人民民主国家所看到的生活与他自己的国家智利以及南美各国的生活情形之不同。他说，“我到一个捷克妇女的家庭去看看。它是一所近代化的美丽的公寓。招待我的主人是一位年青的机械师，他告诉我说，他过去从来没有梦想过会居住在这样的屋子。”
    “我的国家（智利）是极富的，”他继续说，“但没有工人能过着像这样的生活。智利五百万人民有一半以上是没有肉吃。营养是如此短缺，以致人民的平均体高是不断地降低。”
    “当艾奇逊讲自由时，他从没有提及南美洲的暴政，”他说。“维持这些暴君的政权，是符合于艾奇逊所代表的势力的利益。这些独裁者注意使他们的财产存于美国银行中很安全。当他们被驱逐下台时，他们就乘飞机到迈安密。这是古典的样式——最后一次的付钱。”
    “当智利南部发见石油时，美国进出口银行拒绝帮助智利政府取得必需的机器来开采。他们说，他们的钱只借给私人的开采公司。”
    “安那孔达铜公司付给在美国的工人每天工资要八元、十元。在智利铜矿工人每天只得工资五角。
    “对美国公司说来，最大的危险是工资增加。增加工资的斗争是由共产党领导的。为什么帝国主义者的政策是不顾一切来宣布共产党非法并将它毁灭，其缘故在此。为什么他们对那些共产党最强大的国家，智利、巴西和古巴，给予最严重的打击，其缘故在此。对这些国家给予了最大的压迫。帝国主义者希望当共产党被宣布非法时，他们就能够把这些国家拖进他们的战争计划中。”
    虽然有这些暴政和压迫，奈路达认为在南美的反动力量是日益衰弱，而不是日益强大。“真相是智利所采行的政策，经过了一年半之后，并没有成功，”他说。
    他举洛塔的情形为例。那里的一万七千工人中有四千工人被开除出矿，由社会党所供给的破坏罢工者以及农民中落后分子所代替。连续在三次选举中，矿工选举被关闭在集中营中的一位做他们工会的领袖，而他们所选出的执行委员会，大多数的委员是被政府指称为共产党的人们。
    “智利共产党是人民斗争的骨干，”奈路达说。智利共产党是南美洲大陆最伟大的人民领袖勒卡巴龙所创立的。人民从没有怀疑它的民族的性质。当共产党总书记逝世时，参加葬礼的有六万五千人。在他的工会中，有十四万人在他的纪念册上签名。这些都是帝国主义者的失败。
    “帝国主义在南美是注定失败的，”奈路达结束说，“而帝国主义的战争计划也是注定失败的。”
