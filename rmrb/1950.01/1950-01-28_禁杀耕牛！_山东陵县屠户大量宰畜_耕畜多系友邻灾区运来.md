    Ban the Slaughter of Cattle!
    Large-Scale Slaughter of Livestock by Butchers in Ling County, Shandong
    Many Oxen Come from Neighboring Disaster Areas
    A serious phenomenon of slaughtering cattle has occurred in Ling County, Shandong. The disaster situation is severe in neighboring areas of the county. Since the beginning of winter, many livestock have been transported from neighboring disaster areas at very low prices. Some slaughtering merchants take the opportunity to profit (there, selling a hide alone is enough to cover the price of the animal), purchasing good oxen and deceiving the government by falsely reporting to the district offices that they are old, toothless, or disabled, requesting approval for slaughter. Some district offices only have a clerk at home, who casually issues a permit to the butcher, allowing the slaughter. According to the county's statistics for October, a total of 18 cattle were slaughtered in the county; 72 in November, and in December, this rose to 94. This situation is very serious. In order to protect cattle, the county government has taken emergency measures: First, conduct extensive education among the masses in various meetings, strictly enforce slaughter procedures, centralize approval power in the county, and call on Party and government cadres to be vigilant in protecting cattle. Any cattle that need to be slaughtered must be inspected by the district and approved by the county. Second, educate and supervise slaughterhouses, especially tax cadres, who should not only check for tax evasion and make up for tax deficiencies in the market but also inspect slaughterhouses and severely punish those who privately slaughter cattle.

    禁杀耕牛！
    山东陵县屠户大量宰畜
    耕畜多系友邻灾区运来
    山东陵县发生严重屠宰耕牛现象。该县友邻地区灾情严重，入冬以来，友邻灾区运来牲畜很多，价格很低，某些屠宰奸商乘机渔利（在那里，现在杀一头牲畜，光卖一张皮就够牲畜价），购买好耕畜蒙哄政府，到区公所假报说是老齿残疾，请示批准；有些区公所仅有一个文书在家，随便就给屠户起一许可证，准其宰杀。据该县十月份统计，全县共宰十八头耕畜；十一月份七十二头，到十二月份就升到九十四头。此情况非常严重，为了保护耕畜，县府特作紧急措施：一、对广大群众在各种会议上进行广泛的教育，严格宰杀手续，批准权集中在县，号召党政干部对耕畜的保护要严加警惕，凡是需要宰杀的，经区检验，由县批准。二、对屠宰户要进行教育和监督工作，尤其税收干部不仅在集市上查漏税补税工作，对各屠杀户也要进行检查工作，对私杀耕畜者严加惩处。
