A Certain Direct Subordinate Division of the North China Military Region
Implements the Policy of Production and Thrift
Food for the Companies is Generally Improved

[This newspaper reports] The People's Liberation Army's North China Military Region's direct subordinate division resolutely implemented the policy of production and thrift, improved the food for the companies, and the supply of non-staple food exceeded the prescribed standards. Some companies could even eat soybean milk and fried dough sticks in the morning. In July, when the division began training, it put forward the slogan "Establish Revolutionary Housekeeping," which was enthusiastically supported by administrative cadres, branches, and cooks in the companies. Everyone generally reviewed the phenomenon of waste and engaged in production and thrift. In the past, many companies used to give wheat to the local people to grind into flour, and 100 jin of wheat would yield 81 jin of flour. Now, the companies have bought livestock and grind their own flour. 100 jin of wheat can yield 92 jin of flour, and 100 jin of millet can yield more than 100 jin of flour. The remaining bran can also be used to feed livestock and pigs. The stoves used by the companies in the past mostly did not have bellows, which wasted a lot of coal. Now, bellows have been installed in all of them, saving a quarter of the coal used. In the past, all the non-staple food for the companies was purchased locally, which was very expensive. Now, they have adopted a unified long-distance purchase method, which is much cheaper than local purchases. In addition to saving money, the entire division grows vegetables, cuts grass, and raises pigs. The vegetable gardens of the various food units yielded a total of 239,375 jin of vegetables, 11,565 jin of wild vegetables, and 290,115 jin of grass. All food units raised pigs, some raising more than a dozen. This has enabled the food for the companies in the division to be gradually and properly improved. A certain company in the division can drink two bowls of soybean milk and eat two fried dough sticks per person per day, with 1.5 liang of oil and 8 qian of salt and meat each. Another company eats 12 liang of vegetables, 8 qian of salt, 9.4 qian of oil, and 6 qian of meat per person per day. The food standards of these two companies are not isolated phenomena in the division. The commanders and fighters of the division said happily in their prosperous lives: "As long as we resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of production and thrift, we can not only save money for the country, but also further improve our lives."

    华北军区直属某师
    执行生产节约方针
    连队伙食普遍改善
    【本报讯】人民解放军华北军区直属某师，坚决执行了生产节约方针，改善了连队伙食，副食品供给超过规定标准，有的连队早上可以吃到豆浆油条。七月份，该师开始练兵时，即提出：“建立革命家务”口号，得到各连队行政干部、支部、炊事员热烈拥护。大家普遍地检讨浪费现象，从事生产节约。过去很多连队吃面都是拿小麦给驻地老百姓磨，一百斤小麦交八十一斤面。现在各连队都买了牲口，自己磨面，一百斤小麦能磨面九十二斤，一百斤小米能磨面一百斤以上，剩下的麸子还可以喂牲口喂猪。各连队所用炉灶，以前多不设风箱，费煤很多，现在统统设了风箱，用煤较前节省四分之一。各连队的副食品，过去全在驻地买进，价钱很贵。现在他们采用了统一远购办法，较当地购买便宜很多。节约以外，全师种菜、打草、喂猪。各伙食单位的菜园共收菜二三九、三七五斤，打野菜一一、五六五斤，打草二九○、一一五斤。各伙食单位都养了猪，有的养到十几口。这样就使得该师各连队伙食得到逐渐的正当的改善。该师某连每人每天能喝到豆浆两碗，吃到油条两个，油一两五钱，盐肉各八钱。另一个连则每人每天吃到菜十二两，盐八钱，油九钱四分，肉六钱。这两个连队的伙食标准，在该师已不是个别现象。该师指战员在富裕的生活中，高兴得说：“只要我们坚决执行毛主席的生产节约方针，不但能给国家省钱，还能进一步提高我们的生活。”
