Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 13th: TASS, New York, January 13th: The United Nations Security Council held its first meeting of the year on January 10th. The agenda included reviewing the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on the so-called "limitation and reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments."

At the beginning of the meeting, Soviet Representative Malik made a special statement. Malik declared: As is well known, during the Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China sent a statement from Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, to the President of the General Assembly, Romulo, declaring that the Central People's Government refused to recognize the status of the delegation sent to the Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly by the so-called "Chinese Nationalist Government" as legitimate, and refused to recognize this delegation as having the right to represent China or to act in the United Nations in the name of the Chinese people.

Malik continued: The Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly had informed the United Nations that the Soviet delegation supported the statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China and did not recognize the Kuomintang delegation as a qualified delegation because it did not represent China and the Chinese people. In accordance with this position, the Soviet delegation to the Security Council informed the Security Council on December 29th of last year that the Soviet delegation supported the aforementioned statement of the People's Republic of China, believing that the Kuomintang delegation did not represent China and that it was not a qualified representative of the Chinese people in the Security Council.

The Soviet representative further stated: Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, telegraphed Romulo, President of the United Nations General Assembly, United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie, and the governments of all member states of the Security Council on January 8th of this year. The telegram read as follows: "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the presence of representatives of the reactionary remnant clique of the Chinese Kuomintang in the United Nations Security Council is illegal and advocates their expulsion from the Security Council. This telegram is sent for your consideration and action."

Malik declared: The Soviet delegation, under the instructions of the Soviet government, hereby informs the Security Council that the Soviet delegation supports the statement of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and insists on expelling the representatives of the Kuomintang clique from the Security Council. Until the representatives of the Kuomintang withdraw from the Security Council, the Soviet delegation will not participate in the work of the Security Council.

In accordance with the above position, the Soviet representative put forward a proposal to expel the representatives of the Kuomintang clique from the Security Council.

    坚主开除残匪集团代表出安理会
    苏代表支持周外长声明
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社纽约十三日讯：联合国安全理事会于一月十日举行本年度第一次会议。议程中列有审查联合国大会关于所谓“限制与裁减武装部队与通常军备”的决议。
    会议开始时，苏联代表马立克发表特别声明。马立克宣称：如所周知，在联合国第四届大会期间，中华人民共和国中央人民政府曾发来中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来致大会主席罗慕洛的声明，宣告中央人民政府拒绝承认所谓“中国国民政府”派赴联合国第四届大会的代表团的地位为合法，并拒绝承认这个代表团有权代表中国或有权在联合国中以代表中国人民的名义行动。
    马立克继称：联合国大会的苏联代表团曾经告知联合国：苏联代表团支持中华人民共和国政府的声明，并且不承认国民党代表团为合格的代表团，因为它不代表中国和中国人民。依照这个立场，安理会的苏联代表团于去年十二月二十九日告知安理会：苏联代表团支持中华人民共和国的上述声明，认为国民党代表团不代表中国，并且认为它不是中国人民在安理会中的合格代表。
    苏联代表又称：中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来于本年一月八日致电联合国大会主席罗慕洛、联合国秘书长赖伊及安理会各理事国政府，电报内容如下：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，中国国民党反动残余集团的代表留在联合国安全理事会是非法的，并主张将其从安全理事会开除出去。特此电达，希予采纳照办为荷。”
    马立克宣称：苏联代表团奉苏联政府训令特此知照安理会：苏联代表团支持中华人民共和国中央人民政府的声明，并且坚持将国民党集团的代表从安理会开除出去。在国民党代表退出安理会之前，苏联代表团将不参加安理会的工作。
    依照上述立场，苏联代表提出了关于将国民党集团的代表从安理会开除出去的提案。
