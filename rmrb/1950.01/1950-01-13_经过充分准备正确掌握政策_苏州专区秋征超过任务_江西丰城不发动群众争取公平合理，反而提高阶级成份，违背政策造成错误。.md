    After Full Preparation and Correctly Grasping Policy
    Suzhou Prefecture Exceeds Autumn Grain Tax Quota
    Fengcheng, Jiangxi, Fails to Mobilize the Masses to Strive for Fairness and Reasonableness, Instead Raises Class Status, Violating Policy and Causing Errors. Three Characteristics of the Movement:
            1. Long Preparation Time, Short Action Time.
            2. Generally Exceeding the Quota.
            3. Peasants' Enthusiastic Mood for Collective Grain Delivery.
    [Our Newspaper] The autumn grain tax work in Suzhou Prefecture, Southern Jiangsu Administrative Region, has been fully completed due to relying closely on the masses and mobilizing them. To date, the entire prefecture has delivered 394,483,010 catties of grain, completing 101% of the task. The entire movement showed the following characteristics:
    (1) A long time for ideological mobilization and business preparation, and a short time for action. As early as September, the entire prefecture began to organize the land register and establish warehouses, etc. It was not until the various organizational preparations were largely completed that the overall tax collection was started between December 3rd and 8th. After the start of tax collection, it took less than a month to approach completion, with Wu County completing the task in ten days.
    (2) In places where ideological mobilization was mature and business organization preparation was sufficient, not only was the completion time short, but generally the quota was exceeded. For example, Songnan, Songbei, and Dongshan districts in Wu County, Chengqu and Zhengyi districts in Kunshan, Shaxi district in Taicang, Tangqiao district in Changshu, and Dong District in Suzhou City all exceeded the quota. In individual districts and townships in Taicang and Changshu counties, some detours were taken in mobilization work and business preparation, which delayed the time for completing the task.
    (3) Peasants collectively delivered grain with great enthusiasm. In the entire prefecture, except for some areas in Taicang where residents were scattered and there was a lack of boats and other tools (but collective grain delivery was done as much as possible), all other places launched large-scale collective grain delivery actions with great fanfare. Red flags were displayed, gongs and drums were beaten, and dozens or even hundreds of grain boats set off together, fully demonstrating the great power of the organized masses. The grain depot staff also had clear divisions of labor to ensure that each bao (group of households) was completed as soon as it arrived. The technology was also constantly improved. Kunshan once created a record of receiving 110,000 catties of grain in one day with one scale. At the same time, due to the enthusiasm of the masses for delivering grain, landlords and rich peasants in various places also paid off their grain in one or several installments under the supervision of the masses.
            Through repeated publicity to the masses by representatives of all sectors and activists of farmers' associations
    The entire process of autumn grain tax collection generally proceeded smoothly. This was mainly because various places correctly grasped the following key points:
    (1) Strong political mobilization was carried out: Throughout each stage, propaganda and education were implemented from beginning to end. In the first stage, the meaning of grain tax collection was widely publicized to the masses through various meetings. Through education on class policy and reasonable burden policy, the awareness of the masses was raised, and the peasants knew that paying grain was for their own benefit. Zhu Haigen of Nanxing Township, Kunshan, said: "We must pay grain well. After liberating all of China, our liberation will be guaranteed." Yao Shangen of Dong District, Suzhou City, said: "The People's Government works for us, and the People's Liberation Army fights for us. They are all our own people, and we should pay grain to support them." The peasants unanimously supported the reasonable burden policy. For example, representatives of Loudong Township farmers in Dong District, Suzhou City, said: "In the past, landlords and rich peasants did not pay the full amount of rent in grain, or paid very little, and it was all added to us peasants to exploit us. This time, progressive taxation is justified." In the anti-black land and assessment of reductions and exemptions, the peasants knew the truth that "if one family hides land, everyone suffers," and "peasants hide a little, landlords hide a lot," and realized that the landlords' transferring of the burden was an illegal act that violated government laws. Therefore, under the active action of the masses, they resolutely launched a struggle to reason with unscrupulous landlords who conspired to evade the burden. According to preliminary incomplete statistics, more than 300,000 mu of hidden land and unreported land (including self-reporting) were exposed in Wu County, Changshu, Kunshan, Wujiang and other counties.
    (2) The autumn grain tax was discussed in detail at the conference of representatives from all walks of life, and a resolution on the autumn grain tax was made. Therefore, the autumn grain tax policy was implemented to the masses through representatives from all walks of life, so that the masses understood the significance of the autumn grain tax and the rationality of the burden policy. Wu Chengyin, a representative of the Kunshan Conference of Representatives from All Walks of Life, also carried out propaganda and education to the landlords in Zhengyi Township. He specifically stated that paying grain is a national obligation, and they must pay grain honestly.
    (3) Clearly Recognizing that the Peasant Masses are the Basic Force for Completing the Autumn Grain Tax. Therefore, various places first used the form of district and township farmers' congresses to carry out propaganda and education to members of the farmers' association and activists, first raising their awareness and establishing the determination to pay grain. Then, through them, they repeatedly educated the vast number of peasants and gradually raised their awareness. Zhou Shengguan, director of the Kunshan Sanqian Township Farmers' Preparatory Committee, after understanding the idea, said to everyone: "We must make big plans. It's hard now, but the benefits will be great in the future." Ye Kaiyang, a bao representative of Chengnan Township, said at the district farmers' association: "The first thing I will do when I go back is to take the lead in paying grain, and the second thing is to expose the landlords' hidden land."
    (4) Determined to do a good job in all business and technical preparations. The entire prefecture began preparations in September. When organizing the land register, the method of bottom-up registration and top-down verification was generally adopted, and the method of two-list finalization was used to mobilize the masses to make supplementary reports. On October 18, the prefectural grain bureau held a meeting of grain bureau chiefs at all levels to check and arrange the preparatory work, and trained more than 2,000 tax collection assistants. Collective grain delivery was organized everywhere, and the dates, order, and locations of grain delivery were arranged. One district in Wujiang specifically stipulated which river channels the boats of each bao should take to avoid congestion.
            Fengcheng, Jiangxi
            Did Not Verify Land, Classify Classes, Assess Yields, or Squeeze Out Usury
    [Our Newspaper] Since Fengcheng County, Jiangxi Province, convened a county conference of people's representatives from all walks of life on November 8th last year to specifically discuss and study the grain tax collection work, and passed the autumn grain tax resolution, the districts have successively convened farmer representative conferences to publicize the policy of reasonable burden and carry out grain tax collection mobilization, allocating the grain tax task to each bao. This was followed by the widespread establishment of grain tax collection organizations. Most townships established grain tax collection committees, and bao or villages universally organized assessment committees. Twenty days later, it was fully deployed to households. In the grain tax collection, most of the county and district farmer representatives became the backbone of leading the grain tax collection. As of now, of the 669 bao in the county, except for a very small number where the boundaries of the bao have not been clarified, hidden land has not been squeezed out, and tasks have not been allocated to households, they have basically been allocated to households. And it has turned to the stage of delivering grain, and the broad masses are transporting it one after another, and those who have entered the warehouse have reached 5 million catties. However, many biases have emerged in the grain tax collection, which is worthy of attention.
    Because the cadres’ thinking was burdened with ideas such as "the task is heavy, the policy is strict, the time is tight, and it is impossible to complete," and they have not completely overcome it, many problems have emerged in the burden policy during the process of allocating grain tax tasks to households. For example: Squeezing big heads: The land has not been clarified, the yield has not been assessed well, the task cannot be distributed, and the democratic assessment has no bottom. Cadres do not start from mobilizing the masses, investigating the land, squeezing out usury, and carrying out a reasonable burden struggle with the landlord class in a reasonable and legal manner, thus affecting the rapid completion of the task. Many comrades are eager to complete the task, and if the task cannot be assigned, they raise the class status and increase the burden on some middle peasants and even poor peasants with bad records in the past. Some wealthy middle peasants and middle peasants who lent a little usury were also estimated to be included in the total income and assigned tasks, resulting in abnormally heavy burdens. For example, Sun Chunfa of Panqiao Township in the Fifth District only had ten bows of land and lent some usury. According to reports from the masses, it was 200 shi, but the assessment committee assigned him a task of 350 shi. The pseudo-bao chief of the Second Bao in Guanshan Township only had eighteen bows of land, but he was assigned sixty shi. The yield was generally increased; This method not only increases the burden on landlords and rich peasants, but most importantly, increases the burden on poor and middle peasants. The average yield in Fengcheng is usually 2.7-8 shi to 3.1-2 shi, but the average yield in some villages is as high as 5-6 shi. Regardless of whether the masses accept it or not, the task is emphasized and forcibly assigned. In addition, there are those who include the industrial and commercial part in the grain tax collection; these situations not only seriously violate the policy, but also fail to complete the task.
    The root cause of the above deviations, in terms of objective conditions, is that the grain tax collection task and burden policy this year are indeed a distance away from the specific situation in Fengcheng. In addition, the task is urgent, the time is short, the level of awareness of the masses in most areas is low, and there are few cadres, making it difficult to grasp the normal development of the mass movement. But the most basic thing is that the policy thinking of the leadership is not clear, the point of view is purely on the task, and they have not investigated and studied the situation and carried out work in a planned and step-by-step manner. Therefore, there is a lack of confidence. In the grain tax collection work, there is impatience, not enough clarity and calmness, and a lack of understanding of the specific situation, so they are eager to assign tasks. When encountering difficulties, they do not pursue the reasons, do not do careful investigation and research, do not actively think of ways, but simply work hard, simply thinking that the task will be fine as long as it is assigned. Experience in various places has proved that clarifying the land, classifying classes, assessing yields, and squeezing out usury are the basic keys to completing the grain tax collection task. However, some areas in Fengcheng have obviously not done enough. When allocating tasks, there is unfairness between townships and townships, and between bao and bao, due to insufficient preparation beforehand. Some areas simply did not clarify the boundaries of the bao or the land before rushing to assign tasks. Therefore, deviations easily occur in policy. In addition, some cadres have a more serious style of acting in place of others. The idea of ​​relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses to complete the grain tax collection task is not clear. Some efforts have not been made to mobilize the masses to investigate hidden fields, squeeze out usury, and assess burdens. Some places finalized the plan with only one list. After the list was released, when the masses had opinions, the cadres did not consider it a good opportunity to launch a reasonable burden struggle and further implement the policy, but considered it a trouble. Therefore, they were impatient to listen to the opinions and feedback of the masses to correct unreasonable phenomena, and some even hid and did not meet with the masses. This inevitably leads to bias. At the same time, there is also the use of a simple method in mass meetings where as long as the masses shout out who is responsible for how much, it is considered a decision, replacing democratic apportionment.
    Based on the above situation, Fengcheng should conduct necessary re-examination work in the process of organizing the masses to send grain to warehouses. Only by seriously conducting key re-examination work and quickly correcting deviations can the public grain burden truly be reasonable and the task can be completed quickly. Secondly, we must not relax our struggle against the local tyrants and evil landlords who sabotage grain tax collection. In the grain tax collection, a small number of landlords hid to evade the burden, and some tried to delay payment. Individual landlords in Xiaogang, Shangmei, and other townships bought off farmer representatives and incited the masses to resist grain tax collection, and even instigated hooligans to beat village cadres. Some landlords and rich peasants held secret meetings in an attempt to undermine grain tax collection and undermine the policy of reasonable burden. These evil landlords and leading elements must be severely punished, otherwise, it will cause serious obstacles to the completion of future tasks.

    经过充分准备正确掌握政策
    苏州专区秋征超过任务
    江西丰城不发动群众争取公平合理，反而提高阶级成份，违背政策造成错误。运动中的三个特点：
            一、准备时间较长，行动时间较短。
            二、一般的都超过任务。
            三、农民集体缴粮情绪热烈。
    【本报讯】苏南行政区苏州专区的秋征工作，由于紧紧依靠群众，并发动了群众，现已全面完成。至目前止，全专区共缴粮食三亿九千四百四十八万三千○十斤，完成任务的百分之一○一。在整个运动中，表现了如下几个特点：
    （一）思想动员及业务准备的时间较长，行动时间较短。早在九月间，全专区即开始进行整理赋籍与建立仓房等工作，直至各项组织准备工作大体完善后，才于十二月三日至八日先后全面开征。开征后历时不到一月，即接近完成任务，其中吴县在开征后十天全面完成。
    （二）思想动员成熟与业务组织准备工作充分的地方，完成任务不仅时间短，而且一般的超过任务。如吴县淞南、淞北、东山等区，昆山城区、正仪等区，太仓沙溪等区，常熟塘桥等区，苏市东区等地都超过任务。在太仓、常熟等县个别区乡，因在动员工作及业务准备上走了一些弯路，曾延迟了完成任务的时间。
    （三）农民集体缴粮，情绪热烈。全专区除太仓部分地区因居民分散，船只等工具缺乏外（但亦尽可能的做到集体缴粮），其余各地都是掀起轰轰烈烈大规模的集体缴粮行动。缴粮中红旗招展，锣鼓喧天，数十只甚至百十只粮船，一齐出发，充分显示了群众组织起来的伟大力量。粮库助征人员也明确分工，保证了送来一保即完成一保，技术上更不断提高，昆山曾创造了一支磅秤，一日接粮十一万斤的最高纪录。同时，由于群众缴粮情绪的热烈，各地有些地主、富农也在群众监督下一次或分次的缴清粮食。
            通过各界代表会及农会会员积极分子反复向群众宣传
    秋征的整个进程，一般的进行还较顺利，这主要是各地正确掌握了如下几个关键：
    （一）强烈的进行了政治动员：在各阶段中，自始至终贯彻了宣传教育。在第一阶段通过各种会议普遍向群众宣传了征粮意义，通过阶级及合理负担政策的教育，提高了群众的认识，农民知道缴粮是为了自己。昆山南星乡朱海根说：“我们要好好缴粮，解放了全中国，我们翻身才有保障。”苏市东区农民姚善根说：“人民政府替我们办事，解放军替我们打仗，都是我们自家人，我们应该缴粮支援他们。”农民们对合理负担政策，更是一致拥护。如苏市东区娄东乡农民代表说：“地主、富农过去收租不完粮，或完得很少，都加在我们农民身上，剥削我们，这次累进是应该的。”在反黑田、评减免中，通过宣传更使农民知道了“一家瞒田，大家吃亏”、“农民瞒一点，地主瞒一片”的道理，认识了地主的转嫁负担是违反政府法令的不法行为。因此，在群众的积极行动下，坚决向阴谋逃避负担的不法地主展开了说理斗争。吴县、常熟、昆山、吴江等县反出黑田、瞒田（连自报在内）据初步不完全统计共达三十多万亩。
    （二）经过各界代表会详细讨论了秋征，定出了关于秋征的决议。因此把秋征政策经由各界代表，贯彻到群众中去，使群众了解秋征意义及负担政策的合理。昆山各界代表会代表吴承荫还对正仪乡的地主进行了宣传教育。并具体说明征粮是国民义务，要他们规规矩矩缴粮。
    （三）明确的认识了农民群众是完成秋征的基本力量。因此各地首先通过区、乡农代会的形式，对农会会员、积极分子进行了宣传教育，首先提高他们的认识，确立缴粮的决心。然后通过他们，向广大农民反复的进行教育，逐步提高认识。昆山三千乡农筹会主任周生官自己搞通思想后，即对大家说：“我们要打大算盘，现在苦点，将来好处大。”城南乡一保代表叶开扬在区农会上表示：“我回去第一件事是带头缴粮，第二件事是反出地主的黑田。”
    （四）决心做好一切业务技术上的准备工作。全专区在九月间即开始进行准备工作，整理赋籍时，一般采取了自下而上的登记及自上而下的核对方法，并用了两榜定案方式，发动群众补报。十月十八日专署粮食局更召开各级粮食局长会议，检查与布置准备工作。并训练了二千多助征人员。各地都组织了集体缴粮，并排好缴粮日期、次序、地点，吴江有一个区更具体规定了那保船只走那条河道，避免河道船只拥挤。
            江西丰城
            没有查清土地、划好阶级、评定产量、挤出高利贷
    【本报讯】江西丰城县自去年十一月八日召开县各界人民代表会议，专门讨论、研究征粮工作，并通过了秋征决议后，各区先后召开农民代表会，宣传合理负担政策，进行征粮动员，把征粮任务分配到各保。接着是广泛的建立征粮组织机构，绝大部分的乡都成立了征粮委员会，保或村普遍的组织起评议委员会。二十日后，即全面向户布置，在征粮中，绝大部分的县、区农民代表成了领导征粮的骨干。截至目前止，全县六百六十九个保，除极少数因保界没划清、瞒田地没挤出来、任务没分配到户外，基本上都分配到户了。并且已转入送粮阶段，广大群众正纷纷运送，入仓者已达五百万斤。但在征粮中出了不少偏向，是值得注意的。
    由于干部思想上存在着“任务重、政策严、时间紧迫、无法完成”的想法，没有完全克服，所以在征粮工作分配到户的过程中，就在负担政策上出了不少的毛病。例如：挤大头：土地没搞清，产量没评好，任务分不下去，民主评议没有底，干部不从发动群众、进行查土地、挤高利贷、合理合法的与地主阶级展开合理负担斗争，因而影响任务的迅速完成。好多同志完成任务心切，任务派不下去就提高阶级成份，加重过去某些有劣迹的中农甚至贫农的负担。有些放少许高利贷的富裕中农和中农也估计加进总收入内分派任务，因而发生畸重现象。如五区潘桥乡孙春发，只有十弓田，放一些高利贷，据群众报告有二百石，而评委会却派给任务三百五十石。瓘山乡二保伪保长只有十八弓田，即派了六十石，普遍的提高产量；这种办法不仅加重了地主、富农的负担，而最主要的是加重了贫雇中农的负担。丰城平均产量普通是二石七、八至三石一、二，但有些村的平均产量达五、六石之多，不管群众接受与否，强调任务，硬行分配。另外，有计入工商业部分征粮者；这些情形不但严重的违犯政策，而且也完不成任务。
    产生以上偏向的根源，在客观条件来说，是今年征粮任务和负担政策，依丰城的具体情况看，的确是有一段距离。加上任务急、时间短，大部分地区群众觉悟程度低和干部少，难以掌握群众运动的正常发展等。但最基本的是领导上的政策思想不明确，单纯任务观点，又未能调查研究掌握情况，有计划有步骤的进行工作。因而信心不足。在征粮工作中表现出急躁、不够清醒、冷静，对具体情况还不够了解，就急于分配任务。碰到困难，不追求原因，不做慎密的调查研究工作，不积极想办法，而是一味的硬干，单纯的认为任务派下去就好了。各地经验证明：查清土地、划好阶级、评定产量、挤出高利贷是完成征粮任务的基本关键。但丰城有些地区显然做的是不够的。在分配任务时，由于事前准备不够，乡和乡、保和保之间，便发生不公平的现象。有些地区就根本没有划清保界、查清土地，就急于分配任务。因而在政策上也就容易发生偏差。另外是有些干部包办代替的作风较严重。依靠群众、发动群众完成征粮任务的思想不明确。对发动群众查瞒田、挤高利贷、评负担等做的有些不够。有些地方一榜就定案了，出榜后群众有意见，干部不认为是展开合理负担斗争，进一步贯彻政策的好机会，而认为是一种麻烦。因此也就不耐心的倾听群众意见和反映，以修正不合理现象，有的甚至躲起来，不和群众见面。这就难免发生偏向。同时，还有采用在群众大会上只要群众喊一声谁摊负担多少，就算决定了，这种简单化的工作方式代替了民主摊派。
    根据以上情况，丰城在组织群众送粮入仓工作中，应作必要的复查工作，只有认真的有重点的进行复查工作，迅速纠正偏向，使公粮负担真正做到合情合理，任务才能够迅速完成。其次，对破坏征粮的恶霸地主不能放松斗争。在征粮中少数地主为逃避负担躲起来，还有的企图拖延不缴。小港、上美等乡有个别地主收买农民代表，鼓动群众，对抗征粮，甚至有唆使流氓打村干部。有些地主富农开秘密会议，企图破坏征粮，破坏合理负担等。对这些恶霸地主、首恶分子，一定要严加议处，否则将对今后任务的完成还要发生严重障碍。
