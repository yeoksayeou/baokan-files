    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 4th. The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Headquarters and Political Department of the North China Military Region, sent a telegram congratulating the Second Field Army on its great victory. The telegram reads as follows: Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, Deputy Political Commissar Zhang, Chief of Staff Li, and all commanders and fighters of the Second Field Army:

    We warmly congratulate you on your great victory in annihilating the main force of the Hu Zongnan bandit troops, liberating Chengdu and Southwest China, and finally ending the heinous rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang on the entire Chinese mainland.

    Comrades, North China is your birthplace, and the creation and consolidation of the North China Liberated Area is inextricably linked to you. The people of North China deeply miss you and feel unparalleled glory and pride in the remarkable achievements made by their beloved sons and daughters who have fought across the north and south of the Yangtze River for the motherland and the people over the years. In 1950, we will devote all our efforts to restoring and developing production, actively participate in regular national construction work, and strive to support the liberation of Taiwan and Tibet, and to thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the remaining Kuomintang bandit gangs.

                The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Headquarters and Political Department of the North China Military Region
