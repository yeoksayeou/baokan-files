    Ministry of Health Decides to Promote BCG Vaccination in Major Cities
    [This newspaper reported] In order to promote BCG vaccination for the prevention of tuberculosis, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government invited more than 20 responsible persons from health agencies, phthisis experts, and maternal and child health experts from Beijing and Tianjin at the end of last year to hold a special meeting to promote BCG vaccination. The meeting summarized the experience of using BCG in Beijing and Tianjin from April to November. It was generally agreed that BCG vaccination is a safe and reliable method for preventing tuberculosis. Especially in China today, the government should steadily and massively promote it. In the eight months of last year, a total of 16,185 people were vaccinated in Beijing and Tianjin, of which 93% achieved immunity, meaning they would no longer contract tuberculosis. The vast majority of vaccine recipients had no adverse reactions. After discussing technical issues such as vaccination methods and dosages, the meeting decided to continue promotion in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Shenyang, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tangshan, and Wuhan this year. BCG promotion personnel training courses will be established. It has been determined that newborns and children under the age of five, young workers living collectively, students, and soldiers will be the main targets for mass vaccination. The required tuberculin, BCG vaccine, and promotion expenses will be borne by governments at all levels and will no longer be charged.

    卫生部决在各大城市  推广卡介苗接种
    【本报讯】为了推广预防结核病的卡介苗的接种工作，中央人民政府卫生部，去年年底邀集了京津二市各卫生机关负责人员及防痨专家、妇婴卫生专家等二十余人，召开了推广卡介苗接种的专门会议。会上总结了自四月起到十一月止在京津二市试用卡介苗的经验。公认卡介苗接种，是安全可靠的预防结核病的方法之一，特别在今天的中国，应由政府稳步的大量推广。在去年的八个月中，京津两市，共接种了一万六千一百八十五人，其中百分之九十三得到了免疫的效果，即不再得结核病。而受接种人绝大多数没有不良的反应。会上讨论了接种方法、用量等技术问题后，确定今年将在京、津、保、张、太、石、沈、沪、宁、唐山、武汉等城市，继续推广。设立卡介苗推广人员训练班。确定以初生儿及五岁以下儿童，过集体生活的青年工人，学生，士兵为大量接种对象。所需结核菌素、卡介苗及推广用费，由各级政府负担，不再收费。
