Under the guidance of the Municipal Bureau of Industry, accepting processing orders from state-owned enterprises has become the most rapidly recovered and prosperously developed industry among private industries.

The number of factories has increased from 745 before liberation to 1,001, and the number of employees has doubled compared to the time of liberation.

Beijing's private machine and iron industry, under the guidance of the Municipal Bureau of Industry, has accepted processing orders from state-owned enterprises, becoming the most rapidly recovered and prosperously developed industry in the year since liberation. Before liberation, there were 745 machine and iron factories. Due to lack of work, most of them were in a state of shutdown at the time of liberation. By April, all of them had resumed work one after another. New factories were added monthly, and there are now 1,001 factories with a total of more than 5,100 employees, double the number at the time of liberation. On the part of state-owned enterprises, the support of private factories in processing orders has also been of considerable help in completing their own production tasks. At the same time, much experience and lessons have been gained in establishing processing order relationships with private enterprises.

In the past year, the state-owned enterprise organs that have placed the most orders with the private machine and iron industry are the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society of the Ministry of Agriculture. For example, more than 40 factories such as Cixing, Chunji, Yixin, and Dazhong have directly and indirectly undertaken the production of more than 1,000 tons of railway materials such as water cranes, water pipes, and various screws. More than 50 factories such as Shuanglicheng and Xinjiang have undertaken the production of 7,000 waterwheels. Other factories, such as Jinlun and Changshi, have undertaken the production of electrical equipment for the North China Electric Power Company. Six or seven factories, such as Shibao and Efeng, have undertaken the production of physical, chemical and medical equipment for cultural, educational and health institutions, and the quantity is also very large. Another example is the Li'an Steel File Factory, which accepts orders from Beijing, Tianjin and Northeast China, and produced 3,000 dozen steel files this year. The Jian Guo Factory completely accepts orders from state-owned enterprises in Beijing, and produced 250 tons of pig iron this year, all of which have reached the production level before liberation. In addition to these large orders, state-owned enterprises such as the Telecommunications Bureau, the Tram Company, and the Water Company also have many scattered orders.

　　　　　Accepting state orders solved the difficulty of funds and improved technology.

Weak funds are one of the difficulties in the development of the machine and iron industry. According to the statistics of the industry association in November, the total funds of the 121 larger factories were more than 2.7 billion yuan, and the average funds of each factory were only equivalent to more than 24,000 jin of millet, and the rest of the small factories were even weaker. In terms of power equipment, the 121 factories only have 187 motors with a total of 1,164 horsepower; the lathes are not precise enough, and the technical conditions are poor. Most of the factories cannot develop and improve themselves based on their own production capacity. They can only simply reproduce on the original basis. Many factories have always made whatever they were ordered to make. It is passive production, with a wide variety of products, doing everything, and not being proficient in anything.

After the factories established processing and ordering relationships with state-owned enterprises, they first obtained 80% of the order payment or main raw materials for the production of a batch of goods. Without having to raise their own production funds, they can concentrate on producing one or several finished products, and their technology has also been improved. For example, when Shuanglicheng and Dongshunxing factories first undertook the production of waterwheels for the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society, the quality was not good. Later, they gradually researched and improved it. Not only did the finished product meet the specifications, but they also invented the use of machines to make pipes and chains, which significantly improved production efficiency and quality. Many factories have developed vigorously after processing orders for state-owned enterprises. Some have added workers. For example, although the equipment of Cixing Factory is very large, there were only 17 people when it started work, and now it has increased to 192; some have added equipment. For example, Chunji Factory has added a sand casting yard and six sets of forging furnaces, and Xinjiang and Daxing factories have added vertical cupola furnaces.

　　　　　When state-owned enterprises place orders, they should first have an accurate understanding of the situation of private factories.

The experience and lessons learned by state-owned enterprises in processing and ordering work with the private machine and iron industry in the past year are worthy of attention. There are three main points:

First, state-owned enterprises should first have an accurate understanding of the situation of private factories, but in fact this has not been done enough, so that after the order payment is issued, most of them cannot deliver the goods on time and complete the production task. The Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society and the North China Electric Power Company have all encountered great difficulties. As for the reasons for the delay in delivery, some are that the factory owners of private factories only seek profits, breach contracts and violate trust, and some even use the order payment for other purposes. Some are that the quantity of orders exceeds the production capacity. In terms of ordering methods, state-owned enterprises lack accurate cost accounting when ordering, either estimating the price and bargaining, or using comparison methods to inquire from various factories who has the lowest price, or adopting bidding methods, and cannot make reasonable calculations based on raw materials, wages, indirect production costs, and due profits. Therefore, the profits of private factories undertaking orders and various enterprise organs are not consistent, some are high and some are low, and the work with low profits is affected. The North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society has explored experience in this regard, and its work has been improved. It has changed the payment for orders to material supply and processing, and factories do not need to purchase materials themselves. It has also established cost accounting and set the gross profit at 25%, initially establishing a processing and ordering system.

　　　　　State-owned enterprises should have strict inspections after ordering.

Second, state-owned enterprises should have strict inspections after ordering. The Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has neglected this step. After some factories contracted for orders, they did not produce themselves, but transferred the orders to other factories to illegally profit from them, reducing quality. For example, the 600,000 magnetic bottle piercing nails undertaken by the North China Machine Manufacturing Company were transferred in two batches to the Beijing Machine Factory of North China Zhenhua Industrial Company for 300,000 pieces. The unit price was originally 6.6 jin of millet per piece. When transferred, the unit price of the first batch of 200,000 pieces was 4 jin of millet, and the unit price of the second batch of 100,000 pieces was 6 jin of millet; and Zhenhua Factory could not produce all of them, and distributed 190,000 pieces to several other private factories for material supply and processing, and these private factories transferred them again. For example, Longmao Factory had no workers or machines at all, and undertook the processing of 90,000 pieces. The processing fee was originally 65 yuan per piece, and it was transferred to six factories, and Longmao earned a processing fee of 10 to 20 yuan per piece. These six factories distributed them to more than 20 factories to do together. The unit price in the hands of the actual producers has been transferred four or five times, and the unit price of each piece is about one-third lower than the original price of the Ministry of Railways. Due to this transfer of speculation, the quality is poor and the production is delayed. The warehouse inspection personnel of the Ministry of Railways did not seriously inspect them, and many became waste products. For example, of the 50,000 pieces sent to the Jinan Railway Bureau, 17,000 pieces could not be used, causing losses to the people's property and seriously affecting the completion of the railway project on schedule. There are also transfer phenomena for other direct orders to private factories. This is because state-owned enterprises neglected to inspect factory orders. The Ministry of Railways is investigating these situations and investigating responsibilities to improve its work. The North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society is more serious about inspection. There is basically no situation of factories transferring orders, and the phenomenon of cutting corners can often be corrected by going to the factory in time. For example, recently, Jianhua and Datong factories stole the machine iron they received and replaced it with waste boiler iron, which was found and corrected by the Water Conservancy Promotion Society.

　　　　　The productive forces of private factories should be used in a planned and organized manner.

Third, how to use the productive forces of private factories in a planned and organized manner is also a problem worthy of attention in public-private cooperation in the past year. When establishing processing and ordering relationships, state-owned enterprises did not accurately investigate the production capacity and specialties of private factories, and there was no connection and coordination between state-owned enterprises. For example, Cixing Factory accepted orders from the Water Conservancy Promotion Society and then accepted orders from the Ministry of Railways, which delayed the production of waterwheels by two or three months. For example, several factories that originally made weapons turned to making waterwheels. The workers were not skilled and many products did not meet the specifications, resulting in rework. There are also some factories that have a specialty but do not get orders. For example, Zhonghua Boiler Company has special tools for making screws, but it has not received direct orders from state-owned enterprises, but only processes for other private factories.

Next year, the number of orders from state-owned enterprises will inevitably exceed this year. Accepting this year's experience and referring to the methods of Harbin and Dalian in Northeast China, the processing and ordering should be unified by the government departments in charge, and the production tasks of state-owned enterprises should be appropriately distributed in a planned and organized manner. Work should be given according to the specific situation of each private factory, cost accounting should be implemented, profits should be consistent, and not a penny of the people's property should be wasted. Production inspection and technical guidance should be strengthened to reduce costs and improve quality, so that private enterprises can better cooperate with national construction and exert their greatest strength.

    北京私营机器铁工业一年来的发展
    在市工业局指导下，接受国家企业加工订货，已成为私营工业中恢复最迅速发展较繁盛的一业。
    由解放前七百四十五厂增至一千零一厂，职工人数较解放时增加一倍
    北京市私营机器铁工业在市工业局指导下，接受国家企业加工订货，成为私营工业中解放一年来恢复最迅速、发展较繁盛的一业。机器铁工业在解放前有七百四十五厂，因无工可做，解放时大部陷于停工状态，至四月间就先后全部复工，后逐月增设新厂，到目前已有一千零一厂，职工人数共五千一百余人，比解放时增加了一倍。在国家企业方面，由于扶植私营工厂加工订货，对完成自己的生产任务上也有了不少帮助。同时对和私营企业建立加工订货关系上，也获得了不少经验教训。
    一年来向私营机器铁工业订货最多的国家企业机关，以铁道部材料局和农业部华北水利推进社最多，如慈型、纯记、义信、大中等四十余工厂直接间接承做了水鹤、水管、各种螺丝等铁路器材一千余吨；双利成、新建等五十余工厂承做水车七千台；其他金轮、昌实等十余工厂承做华北电业公司电气器材；世保、鄂锋等六、七个工厂给文教卫生机关承做理化医疗器料，数量也很大；再如立安钢锉厂，接受京、津和东北各地订货，今年生产了钢锉三千打；建国工厂完全给京市国家企业订货，今年生产元铁二百五十吨，也都达到解放前生产水平。除这些大宗订货外，电信局、电车公司、自来水公司等国家企业机关的零星订货也不少。
            接受国家订货，解决了资金困难，提高了技术。
    资金薄弱是机器铁工业发展的困难之一，据十一月份该业公会统计，在较大型的一百二十一个工厂中，资金共二十七亿余元，平均每厂资金仅合小米两万四千余斤，其余小厂则更薄弱。在动力设备方面，一百二十一厂只有一百八十七座马达，共一千一百六十四马力；车床不够精密，技术条件低劣，绝大部分工厂不能凭自己的生产能力向前发展提高，只有在原基础上单纯再生产，许多工厂一向是有人来订什么就做什么，是被动地生产，产品种类繁多，样样都做，没有一样精通。
    各工厂自从和国家企业建立加工订货关系后，生产一批货首先取得八成订款或主要原料。不用自己筹措生产资金，可以专心致力生产一种或几种成品，技术也因之提高。如双利成、东顺兴两厂，开始承做华北水利推进社水车时，品质不好，后逐渐研究改进，不但成品合乎规格，而且发明用机器打管子、链子，生产效率和品质都有显著提高。许多工厂给国家企业加工订货后，发展日趋蓬勃，有的添加工人，如慈型工厂设备虽很大，开工时只十七人，现在已增加到一百九十二人；有的增建设备，如纯记工厂增建了翻砂场和六盘锻造炉，新建和大兴两厂增建了立式化铁炉。
            国家企业进行订货时，对私营工厂情况首先应有确切了解。
    国家企业在和私营机器铁工业加工订货工作中，一年来获得的经验教训，是值得重视的，主要有三点：
    第一、国家企业对私营工厂情况首先应有确切了解，但事实上做得不够，以致发出订款后，多不能如期交货完成生产任务。铁道部材料局、华北水利推进社和华北电业公司都曾遇到极大困难，至于延误交货期限的原因，有的是私营工厂厂方只图牟利，背约违信，个别的甚至拿到订款移作别用，有的则是订货数量超过了生产能力。在订货方式上，又因国家企业缺乏精确成本计算，订货时或是估量着要价还价、或是用比价方法到各厂探询谁的价格低就由谁做，或是采取投标方法，不能按原料、工资、间接生产费、应得利润做合理计算，所以私营工厂承做订货，各企业机关利润毫不一致，有高有低，利润低的工作就受到影响。华北水利推进社在这方面已摸索出经验，工作有了改进，把现款订货改成供料加工，工厂无须自己购料，还建立了成本计算，定毛利为百分之二十五，初步树立了加工订货制度。
            国家企业订货以后应有严格检查
    第二、国家企业订出货后应有严格检查。铁道部材料局忽略了这一步工作，有些工厂承包订货后自己不生产，而转手倒包给别的工厂，非法从中牟利，降低品质。如华北机器制造公司承做的磁瓶穿钉六十万枚，该公司就分两批转手倒包给华北振华实业公司北京机器厂三十万枚，单价每枚原为六点六斤小米，转包时第一批二十万枚单价为四斤小米，第二批十万枚单价为六斤小米；而振华工厂也不能全部生产，又分给其他几个私营工厂十九万枚，供料加工，而这几个私营工厂又再度转包出去。其中如隆茂工厂根本没有工人，也没有机器设备，承做加工九万枚，加工费原为每枚六十五元，又转给六个工厂，隆茂从中赚加工费每枚十元到二十元。这六个工厂又分给二十余工厂共同做，到实际生产者手中已辗转了四、五次，每枚单价距铁道部原价降低约三分之一。由于这样转手倒把的结果，使品质低劣，生产误期。铁道部仓库验收人员也没有认真检查，有许多成为废品。如发到济南铁路局五万枚中竟有一万七千枚不能使用，造成人民财产的损失，并严重影响铁路工程的如期完成。其他直接订货给私营工厂的也有转手现象。这是由于国家企业对工厂订货忽略检查，铁道部正根据这些情况，进行调查，追究责任，以改进工作。华北水利推进社是比较认真检查的，工厂倒把转手的情况基本上没有，偷工减料现象，也多能及时下厂纠正，如最近建华、大同两工厂把领来的机铁偷换成废锅铁，即被水利推进社查出纠正。
            应有计划有组织地使用私营工厂生产力
    第三、如何有计划、有组织地使用私营工厂生产力，也是一年来公私合作中值得注意的问题。在建立加工订货关系时，国家企业没有精确调查私营工厂的生产能力和特长，国家企业之间更没有联系配合，如慈型工厂接受水利推进社订货后，又接受铁道部订货，因之水车生产延期二、三个月才交齐。又如几个原做武器的工厂，转业后承做水车，工人技术不熟练，产品多不合规格，发生重作反工现象。还有些工厂具有一种特长却得不到订货，如中华汽炉行，有造螺丝的专门工具，即没有得到国家企业的直接订货，只替别的私营工厂加工。
    明年国家企业订货数量势必超过今年，接受今年的经验，参考东北哈尔滨、大连的办法，加工订货宜由政府主管部门统一管理，有计划有组织地适当分配国家企业的生产任务，根据各私营工厂具体情况给予工作，实行成本计算，利润一致，不浪费一分一毫人民财产，加强生产检查以及技术指导，降低成本提高品质，以使私营企业能更好地配合国家建设，发挥最大的力量。
