Winter production is an important foundation for completing this year's agricultural production plan, and all regions must pay attention to it and strengthen leadership. This brief report from the Shanxi Provincial Government's Department of Agriculture provides a timely summary of winter production conditions, draws on experience, and raises issues. It is very instructive and also has reference value for other regions, so it is specially published.
Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture

Based on written reports from Changzhi, Yuci, Xinzhou, and Linfen four special districts and Daixian, Shouyang, Anze, Changzhi, Guoxian, Huguan, Lucheng, Jinyuan eight counties, and letters from the inspection team sent by the provincial government to Fenyang, there are several problems that must be solved in the current winter production campaign:

I. Expand Manure Accumulation Area:

Since the start of winter production, incomplete statistics from Jincheng, Yangcheng, Gaoping, Changzhi, Lucheng, Licheng, Huguan, Pingshun, Lingchuan, Tunliu, Wuxiang, Qin County, Xiangyuan, Yuci, Xiyang, Zuoquan, Yuci, Fenyang, Zhongyang, Anze twenty counties, including three entire counties, nine entire districts, and eight hundred and thirty-one administrative villages (including one natural village), have accumulated 91,119,879 dan of fertilizer (including human waste, livestock manure, smoked fertilizer, oilseed cakes, etc.). Jincheng, Yangcheng, Gaoping, Lucheng, Lingchuan, Pingshun, Wuxiang, and Tunliu have all reached 50% or more of next year's fertilizer application. Other counties such as Yuci, Zuoquan, and Xiyang have also reached one-third of the planned 40 to 60 dan per mu for next year. Yuci, Zuoquan, Heshun, and Xiyang counties plan to increase by 7 to 10 dan per mu in 1950 compared to 1949. Yangquan, Mengxian, Shouyang, and Pingding counties require an increase of 5 to 7 dan. The Qianhouzhuang Huayukou administrative village in Fenyang's Ninth District organized 25 carts and 50 donkeys to haul human waste from the city, bringing back 35,000 to 40,000 jin every day, for a total of over 1.5 million jin. Sang Wensheng, a coal mine worker in Anju Village, Lucheng, couldn't spare time for manure accumulation. His wife and mother chopped the corn stalks from 10 mu of land in three days and scraped 19 cartloads of sod. They have now accumulated 120 cartloads of fertilizer. After the Party Congress, the Party branch of Shangxian Village in Anze drew up a manure accumulation plan for the village, with male and female Party members taking the lead and helping the masses solve specific difficulties, launching a manure accumulation campaign. They have now accumulated 58,144 dan of fertilizer, completing slightly more than 65% of the requirement of 34 dan per mu. However, we cannot be satisfied with the above achievements and must pay attention to solving the following three problems.

First, we must simultaneously pay attention to the accumulation of fertilizer for families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers. The land of military families accounts for about 20% of the total cultivated land. If this work is neglected, production will be greatly affected. According to reports, except for Heshun, which has organized the accumulation of 9,340 dan of fertilizer for military families, there is little evidence of this work elsewhere.

Second, pay attention to improving quality. For example, Micizhen in Lucheng has accumulated a total of 163,000 dan of fertilizer, of which first-class fertilizer (such as oilseed cakes, human waste, etc.) accounts for only 16%, medium-class fertilizer (such as livestock manure, etc.) accounts for 7%, and low-class fertilizer (such as ash, road soil, barren fertilizer, etc.) accounts for 77%. This shows that improving the quality of fertilizer is a major issue at present, otherwise the effort will be in vain. Except for Changzhi, which paid attention to quality in manure accumulation, with most villages chopping corn stalks, irrigating with night soil, and then pressing a layer of soil to make the corn stalks easier to rot, and using methods such as padding the sheep pen to improve the fertilizer quality, other regions have paid little attention to quality.

Third, breaking through new areas and weak areas can expand the achievements in manure accumulation. According to a report from the Yuci Special District, except for Yuci, Zuoquan, Xiyang, and Heshun counties, the other ten counties have not yet launched a manure accumulation campaign, especially in the new areas of Jinzhong. Even the old areas are unbalanced. For example, in Changzhi County, 80% of the autumn fields have prepared enough fertilizer to apply an average of 60 dan per mu. However, a specific inspection reveals a great disparity. Some have reached 120 dan per mu, some have only 20 dan, and some households have not accumulated any fertilizer at all. For example, after checking door-to-door in Wulidian Village, Lucheng, out of 226 households, 11 households have not accumulated any fertilizer, and 61 households have less than 20 dan per mu. Therefore, we cannot be satisfied with the average number and obscure our shortcomings of imbalance.

II. Increasing Livestock and Repairing Farm Implements: Only some areas have achieved some results, or some are preparing. Regarding farm implements, in Xinjiang, Yicheng, Yuanqu, Pingding, Yangquan, Yangcheng, Jincheng, Wuxiang, Xiyang, Yuci, Pingshun, Licheng, Lucheng, Qinshui fourteen counties, handicraft tool manufacturers have begun to manufacture plows, seeders, harrows, chisels, bracelets and other farm implements in large quantities. Fourteen villages in Pingshun have manufactured 840 farm implements. The Yicheng Iron and Wood Factory has produced 24,000 farm implements in the past eight months, of which 90% have been sold. The Taiyuan Linong and Wancheng Iron and Wood Factories have produced 20 waterwheels, which the masses are scrambling to buy. Six public and private iron and wood factories in Xinjiang City have sold 194 cotton gins, 47 cotton gins, and 20 waterwheels. Many villages are placing orders. The provincial government's inspection team sent to Fenyang has jointly studied with the special commissioner's office and is strengthening this work. Regarding increasing livestock purchases, banks have issued large amounts of loans to help the masses purchase livestock. According to incomplete statistics in November, 960 head of livestock, 3 breeding animals, and 120 female animals have been purchased with loan support. Among them, Yicheng, Jiangxian, Fushan, and Qinshui four counties purchased 131 head in two months. The Fenyang Special District, with Wenshui and Fenyang as the focus, lent 55,055 jin of grain and prepared to purchase 964 head of livestock with private funds. According to statistics from seven villages in Wenshui, 49 head have been purchased. However, the scope of the campaign is still very small, and the leadership in some areas has not yet paid enough attention. If these two tasks are not done well, they will directly affect next year's production tasks.

III. In addition to accumulating fertilizer, accumulating fuel, and agricultural preparations such as farm implements, livestock, and water conservancy, we should vigorously support and develop all kinds of handicrafts with prospects in various regions. According to statistics from Jincheng, Wuxiang, Gaoping, Yangcheng, and Huguan, 767 various handicraft iron furnaces (including iron smelting furnaces and finished product furnaces) have been restored. In Huguan, Jincheng, Qinshui, Yicheng, Jiangxian, Fushan, Xiangning, Shixian, Puxian, Fenxi, Linfen, Hongdong, Zhaocheng, and Pinglu fourteen counties alone, 829 coal and iron kilns have been restored. In Huguan Wuji and other six villages, 76 iron furnaces and coal kilns have purchased more than 1,000 shi of millet. Qinshui, Yicheng, Jiangxian, and Fushan four counties had 39 coal kilns before the war, which have now been developed to 64. Jincheng has increased more than 60 iron furnaces compared to last winter. Now, 70 to 80 large carts travel to Zhengzhou every day to transport and sell iron goods. All 269 workshops in the county are in operation. In Guoxian, most of the livestock, except for the old, weak, and disabled, have participated in transportation, accounting for about 60% of the total number of livestock. In the Eighth District, out of a total of 21,821 head, more than 90% have participated in transportation (transporting local pear and fruit products, etc.). All 270 large carts in the county have participated in the transportation of iron goods. Five large carts in Wenshu Village earned a piece of foreign cloth and 20,000 yuan in RMB in three days. Linfen County contracted to transport 10,000 railway sleepers from Anze. Thirty-three livestock and eight carts in Jia Village contracted to transport 1,000 sleepers, taking 36 days. After deducting 1,013 jin of rice for human and animal expenses, they earned a net profit of 169 shi of millet. In Daixian, 85% of the male labor force and 54.5% of the animal power have participated in transportation work. In Fenyang County, Aopo and Sanggou two small natural villages, with a total of 94 households, have organized six charcoal kilns. Including transportation, they have organized 27 donkeys and mules and more than 50 households of labor, earning 14,628 jin of rice, which can solve two-thirds of their public grain quota. Seeing Hao Guofang and others earning 24 dou of rice every day by driving two large carts to transport grain, Song Zhongxin, the village head of Zhongshan Village in Xiyang, bought a cart for six shi of rice, thus promoting the whole village to buy four large carts together. Wenshui set up a coal station in the city in November, collecting 230,000 jin of coal. In Lucheng, more than 15,000 women in three districts have stepped up the braiding of straw hat braids. Under the support of cooperatives, they have paid attention to improving technology. In Linfen County, "every village raises pigs, every household raises chickens," averaging more than one chicken per person. In Shouyang County, women in Nanku and Hancun villages, in addition to raising eight pigs, also strive to do more needlework to prepare clothes and shoes for next year, so that they can spare time to participate in farming. Zhou Zaichang's family in Banpo Village, Yuci, has twelve people. In order to encourage his three daughters-in-law to raise pigs, he convened a family meeting with the help of Kong Rimei, a district cadre, and implemented a pig-raising dividend system, awarding the daughters-in-law two fat pigs from 21 pigs. This encouraged the women's enthusiasm. In addition to raising pigs, they also formulated a plan to accumulate more fertilizer, padding the pigsty with five dan of soil every day. They have now accumulated more than 800 dan of fertilizer. Pei Fengying, a female Party member in Dazhai Village, discovered that many women were worried that raising pigs was unprofitable and that they did not know how to raise them. He convened a meeting to mobilize them, using his practical experience to promote others, saying, "I captured a piglet with five dou of rice in July the year before last, and sold it for one shi and seven dou of rice in March this year, which was a big deal." He also introduced his pig-raising methods. After this explanation, 15 new piglets have been added to the village. From the above facts, winter sideline production is diverse. Conversely, in Changzhi, Lingchuan and other places, some cadres believe that winter production is just about transportation. They do not actively lead the masses to develop various sideline businesses that can be developed locally. For example, cadres in a certain village in Xinzhou forced the masses to engage in transportation, so that the manure in some latrines overflowed, but they were not allowed to empty them. This is a mechanical approach that is divorced from the masses. In addition, cooperatives in various places should specifically organize the masses to promote and sell sideline products, which is also a pressing need for farmers at present. For example, the cooperative in Wuyi Village, Pingshun, has established a contract with the county cooperative to promote local agricultural products in a planned manner, which has been welcomed by the masses. However, some areas are still doing poorly. For example, Zhongyang produced 7,000 shi of red dates this year (250 jin per shi). Most of the masses mainly rely on this income to maintain their lives, but now they can't find a market even at "one jin of dates for half a jin of rice." The same is true for other medicinal materials such as licorice, codonopsis, and poria cocos. Therefore, the work of cooperatives in various places must be strengthened in a planned manner to organize the purchase and sale of rural products. Caozha Village in Hequ has 141 donkeys and cattle. Due to the poor harvest this year and the lack of a way to earn money in winter production, the masses sold 50 donkeys and cattle in order to solve the need for food and clothing. This should attract serious attention from the local leadership.

IV. Introduction of Two Methods for Leading Winter Production:

(1) After arranging winter production, Zhongyang County immediately determined three experimental villages (Sanjiao, Liulinxu, and Zhuangjiahui). The county sent cadres to personally lead and create experience in order to promote it in an all-round way. Each district also has production support point villages, and district cadres are responsible for leading. The county head and county secretary often take turns going to the countryside to inspect (the county head has already gone to the countryside once). In addition, the county also organized two inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections in various villages on November 24. Pangjiahui Natural Village in the county has a total of 120 households and 160 people, and organized 107 people (accounting for two-thirds of the population), including 30 people carrying charcoal, 4 people ginning cotton, 4 people opening tofu workshops, 6 people transporting salt, 2 people trafficking livestock, 4 people弹花, 53 people accumulating manure, and 4 people extracting oil. In addition, there are 10 women organized to spin, weave, and make shoes, planning to earn 32 shi of millet this winter. The main reason for this is the result of Comrade Gao Shicheng, the head of the organization department of the county, personally inspecting and promoting it. Because the county attached importance to this work, implemented responsible cadres taking the lead and established basic point experiments, it was able to realize the winter production plan in an organized manner. For example, four villages in the Sixth District requested to purchase 70 more livestock this winter, but have now purchased more than 100 head, exceeding the original plan by 40%.

(2) Dazhai Village, Yuci, has 610 mu of land, requiring 60 dan of fertilizer per mu, for a total of 37,200 dan. It has now accumulated 25,000 dan of fertilizer. Not satisfied with this general number, they conducted a door-to-door inspection. As a result, Zhang Jiangyuan and other nine households only had 30 dan per mu, while Zhiquan and other ten households could reach 60 dan per mu. After discovering this, the branch immediately studied and proposed the slogan "Clarify the bottom now, it's not too late to accumulate fertilizer." They mobilized women to accumulate fertilizer. Zhiquan's group of ten people first repaired a pigsty, and six pigs can accumulate 1,200 dan of fertilizer in winter. Under the leadership of male and female Party members, the village repaired 15 pigsties for 125 pigs. Cao Majiang, who lacked fertilizer, has dug 500 dan of pit soil. Three or five women in the village are working hard to complete the task of accumulating 150 dan of fertilizer per person. This is how the fertilizer preparation can be comprehensively improved.

    山西冬季生产一旬
    十二月十日至十二月二十日
    山西省人民政府农业厅
    冬季生产是完成今年农业生产计划的重要基础工作，各地必须予以重视，加强领导。山西省府农业厅的这一简报，及时综合冬季生产情况，吸取经验，提出问题，很有指导意义，对其他各地也有参考价值，故特为发表。
                                          中央人民政府农业部
    十天来从长、榆、忻、汾、四个专署及代县、寿阳、安泽、长治、崞县、壶关、潞城、晋源等八县书面报告和省府派去汾阳的检查组来信看，在目前冬季生产运动中有几个必须解决的问题：
    一、扩大积肥面积：
    冬季生产开展以来晋城、阳城、高平、长治、潞城、黎城、壶关、平顺、陵川、屯留、武乡、沁县、襄垣、榆社、昔阳、左权、榆次、汾阳、中阳、安泽等二十个县中有三个整县九个整区及八百三十一个行政村（内有一个自然村）的不完全统计，已积肥（包括人肥、圈肥、薰肥、油饼等）九千一百一十九万八千三百七十九担；晋城、阳城、高平、潞城、陵川、平顺、武乡、屯留均已达到明年施肥量的百分之五十以上；其他榆社、左权、昔阳等县亦达到明年计划每亩四十至六十担的三分之一；榆次、左权、和顺、昔阳等县计划五○年比四九年每亩增加七至十担，阳泉、孟县、寿阳、平定等县要求增加五至七担，汾阳九区前后庄化峪口行政村组织了大车二十五辆，驮驴五十头，从城里往回拉人粪，每天拉回三万五千斤到四万斤，共拉回一百五十余万斤。潞城安居村桑文生是煤窑工人顾不来积肥，他女人和他母亲三天铡完十亩地的玉茭杆，又刮了十九车草皮土，现已积肥一百二十车。安泽上县村党的支部在党代会后订出了本村积肥计划，以男女党员带头与帮助群众解决具体困难，掀起了积肥运动，现已积肥五万八千一百四十四担，按每亩三十四担的要求，已完成百分之六十五强。但我们不能满足上述成绩，必须注意解决以下三个问题。
    第一、必须同时注意烈、军、工属的积肥，军属的土地约占总耕地的百分之二十左右，如果忽略了这个工作，将使生产受到很大影响。据报告除和顺已组织帮助军属积肥九千三百四十担外，其他很少看到这方面的工作。
    第二、重视提高质量：如潞城微子镇共已积肥十六万三千担，其中头等肥（如油饼、人粪等）仅占到百分之十六，中等肥（如牲畜粪等）占百分之七，末等肥（如灰渣、道土、荒肥等）占百分之七十七，这说明提高肥料质量是当前的大问题，否则即事倍功半。除长治在积肥上注意了质量，大部村子将玉茭杆切碎，用圊肥灌过再压层土，使玉茭杆容易腐烂，并用垫圈圈羊等方法来使肥质提高外，其他很少注意质量。
    第三、突破新区与薄弱地带才能使积肥成绩扩大。据榆次专区报告除榆社、左权、昔阳、和顺等县外，其他十个县还未展开积肥运动，特别是晋中新区做的更差，即使老区亦不平衡，如长治全县有百分之八十秋田已准备足够每亩施肥六十担的平均数字，若具体检查一下，则悬殊甚大，多的每亩达一百二十担，少的二十担，还有的户根本未积，如潞城五里店全村二百二十六户挨门检查后，有十一户根本未积，有六十一户每亩尚不足二十担，因此我们不能满足于平均数字而遮蔽了我们不平衡的缺点。
    二、增殖牲畜与修制农具，只在部分地区有些成绩，或有的正在筹备。在农具方面现在新绛、翼城、垣曲、平定、阳泉、阳城、晋城、武乡、昔阳、榆社、平顺、黎城、潞城、沁水等十四县，手工业工具制造者已开始大批制造犁、耧、耙、钎、镯等农具，平顺十四个村已制出农具八百四十件，翼城铁木厂八个月来生产农具二万四千件，已出售百分之九十。太原利农、万成两铁木厂生产出二十部水车，群众争购，新绛市公私铁木厂六家已售出弹花机一百九十四部、轧花机四十七部，水车二十部，各村订货者很多，派去汾阳的省府检查组已和专署共同研究，正在加强这个工作。在增购牲畜方面，银行已发出大批贷款，帮助群众购畜，据十一月份不完全统计，在贷款扶植下已购回牲畜九百六十头，种畜三头，母畜一百二十头，其中翼城、绛县、浮山、沁水四县两个月内购回一百三十一头，汾阳专区以文水、汾阳为重点，贷粮五万五千零五十五斤，结合私资准备购畜九百六十四头，据文水七个村统计，已购回四十九头，但运动的面积仍然很小，特别是有些地区的领导上还未引起重视，如果做不好这两件工作，将直接影响明年的生产任务。
    三、除了积肥料、积燃料和农具、牲畜、水利等农业准备工作外，对于各地区各种各样的手工业，凡是有前途的都应大量扶植与发展，据晋城、武乡、高平、阳城、壶关统计已恢复各种手工业铁炉（包括炼铁炉与成货炉）七百六十七座，煤铁窑只壶关、晋城、沁水、翼城、绛县、浮山、乡宁、湿县、蒲县、汾西、临汾、洪洞、赵城、平陆十四县即已恢复八百二十九座，壶关五集等六村铁炉煤窑七十六座已购回小米一千余石，沁水、翼城、绛县、浮山四县战前煤窑三十九座，现发展到六十四座，晋南乡宁等县解放前煤窑三百多座，现已发展到五百七十八座，晋城比去年冬季增加铁炉六十余座，现全县每日有七八十辆大车往来郑州一带运销铁货，全县各种作坊二百六十九座全部营业。崞县的牲畜除去老弱残废外，大部都参加了运销，约占牲口总数的百分之六十，八区共有二万一千八百二十一头，参加运输的占百分之九十以上（运输当地梨果产品等），全县二百七十辆大车，全部参加运送铁货，文殊村五辆大车三天赚下洋布一匹，人民币二万元，临汾全县包运安泽枕木一万根，贾村三十三个牲口八辆大车包运了一千根，共用出三十六天时间，除人畜开支一千○十三斤米外，净赚小米一百六十九石，代县已有百分之八十五的男劳力及百分之五十四点五的畜力都参加了运输工作。汾阳县熬坡、桑沟两个小自然村共九四户，有组织的开了六个木炭窑，连搞运输共组织起二十七头驴骡及五十余户劳力，已赚米一万四千六百二十八斤，可解决他们应交公粮的三分之二，昔阳中山村群众看到郝国芳等二人赶着两辆大车运粮，每天赚米二十四斗，村长宋中心用六石米买了一辆车，这样推动全村合伙买大车四辆。文水十一月份在城内设立了一个煤站，已收煤二十三万斤，潞城三个区已有一万五千余妇女加紧编制草帽辫，在合作社扶植下已注意到提高技术，临汾全县已作到“村村喂猪，家家养鸡”平均超过每人一鸡。寿阳县南库、韩村妇女除喂猪八口外，还争取多作针线活，准备明年穿衣用鞋，可余出时间参加种地。榆社板坡村周再常家十二口人，他为了鼓励三个媳妇喂猪，在区干部孔日梅帮助下召开了家庭会议，实行了喂猪分红，从二十一条猪中奖给媳妇们两条膘猪，这样鼓励起了妇女情绪，他们除养猪外还订出多积肥计划，每天往猪圈垫土五担，现已积肥八百多担，大寨村妇女党员裴凤英发现许多妇女认为养猪利小和不会养的顾虑，他开会动员，以他的实际经验来推动别人，说：“我前年七月，五斗米捉猪娃，今年三月卖了一石七斗米，顶了大事”，又介绍他的养猪方法，这样解释后全村已新添小猪十五头，从以上事实看来，冬季副业生产是多样性的，相反的在长治、陵川等地有些干部认为冬季生产就是搞运输，不积极领导群众开展当地所能开展的各种副业，再如忻县××村干部强迫群众搞运输，致有的茅坑内粪满外流，都不让掏，这是脱离群众的机械作法。另外各地合作社具体组织群众推销副业产品，也是农民当前的迫切要求，像平顺五一个村合作社都和县社建立合同，有计划的推销当地农产品，便受到了群众欢迎。可是有的地区做的仍差，如中阳今年产红枣七千石（每石二百五十斤）大部群众主要依靠这一笔收入来维持生活，但现在“一斤枣半斤米”都还找不到销路，其它如甘草党参猪苓等药材亦同样如此，因此各地合作社的工作必须有计划的加强组织农村产品收购推销，河曲草栅村有驴牛一百四十一头，群众因今年歉收，冬产又找不到个赚钱门路，为了解决吃穿需要，便出卖了驴牛五十头，这是应该引起当地领导上严重注意的。
    四、两个领导冬季生产方法的介绍：
    （一）中阳县在冬季生产布置后，即确定三个实验村（三交、柳林窳、庄家会），县里派干部亲自领导，创造经验，以便推广全面。每区还有生产支点村，区干部负责领导，县长与县书经常轮流下乡检查（县长已下乡一次）。此外县里还组织了两个检查组，于十一月二十四日，深入各村检查，该县庞家会自然村共一百二十户，一百六十人，组织起来一百○七人（占人口三分之二），其中三十人担炭，四人轧花，四人开豆腐坊，六人运盐，二人贩牲口，四人弹花，五十三人积粪，四人榨油，另外还有十个妇女组织起来纺花织布、做鞋、计划冬季要收入三十二石小米。所以能够这样，主要是该县组织部长高世成同志亲自检查推动的结果。由于该县重视了这一工作，实行负责干部亲自动手并建立基点试验，因此能够有组织的实现冬季生产计划，如六区四个村今冬要求增购牲畜七十头，现在已购回一百余头，超过原计划百分之四十。
    （二）榆社大寨村六百一十亩土地，每亩施肥六十担，共需三万七千二百担，现已积好肥二万五千担，他们不满足这个一般数字，又进行了挨户检查，结果张江元等九户每亩只有三十担，志全等十户每亩可上到六十担，发现后支部即时研究，提出“现在澄清底，积肥还不迟”的口号，发动妇女积肥，志全组十人首先修理一个猪圈，六口猪冬季可积肥一千二百担，在男女党员带头下，全村一百二十五口猪修好猪圈十五个，缺肥的曹马江已刨槽土五百担，村中三五个妇女为完成每人积肥一百五十担而努力，这样做才使增肥准备全面提高。
