The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branches have been developing for more than four months, and now have 230 general branches and branches, with more than 175,000 members.

The development of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association members is based on organized masses, with factories and schools as the focus. Up to now, larger factories in Beijing, all universities, most middle schools, and twelve districts in the city, and eight districts in the four suburbs have successively established general branches or branches. At the same time, nine-tenths of the municipal-level agencies, organizations, and the capital's public security forces have also established organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. In order to facilitate leadership and integrate with actual business, the general branches, branches, and groups of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association are established according to the administrative, trade union, and study systems of each unit. In more than four months, the branch has held a series of lectures and reports to strengthen the Beijing people's understanding and study of the Soviet Union. In addition, it has also introduced Soviet construction experience in conjunction with the actual business of each unit, such as exhibiting Soviet pictures, introducing Soviet trade union organizations, workers' lives, the Stakhanovite movement, the democratic life of the Soviet people, and medical and health work, and launched discussions in branches and groups based on these contents. In addition to guiding and assisting various branches in carrying out the above work, the branch has also established a service department, a data room, and a reading room. In addition to holding photo exhibitions and touring film screenings in factories, troops, and schools, the service department has also co-founded a Russian language broadcasting lecture with Beijing People's Broadcasting Station.
