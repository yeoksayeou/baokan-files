Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: Chengdu News: The General Headquarters and Political Department of the People's Liberation Army's 18th Army Corps held a rally on the 11th of this month to welcome uprising officers from the outskirts of Chengdu and within Chengdu. Commander He Long attended and delivered a speech. Commander He first extended a warm welcome to the uprising officers, saying, "The People's Liberation Army has always warmly welcomed officers and soldiers who resolutely break away from the Kuomintang reactionaries and revolt. After the uprising, according to the system and principles of the People's Liberation Army, and after reorganization and transformation, you will be part of the People's Liberation Army. Everyone should unite closely with the People's Liberation Army and achieve genuine unity from organizational consistency to ideological consistency, becoming a true people's army."

Regarding the guiding principles for the transformation of the uprising troops, Commander He pointed out: "First, it is necessary to eliminate Kuomintang espionage work and establish revolutionary political work, that is, political work that serves the people and serves the soldiers in everything. All uprising troops should immediately focus on conducting revolutionary political education, comparing the People's Liberation Army and the Kuomintang reactionary army to explain the essential differences between the two armies: the People's Liberation Army is the army of the people, a tool for liberating and protecting the people; the Kuomintang reactionary army is the army of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, a tool for opposing and oppressing the people. The uprising troops must thoroughly change the evil habits of oppressing the people fostered by Chiang Kai-shek's leadership in the past, and quickly establish the ideological style of serving the people, honestly acting as orderlies for the people. Only in this way, by first transforming into a people's army politically, will military reorganization and training be meaningful."

Commander He finally encouraged everyone to learn humbly and transform themselves so that everyone can become a people's soldier defending the motherland.

    十八兵团集会欢迎起义军官
    贺司令员勖勉改造思想
    【新华社北京二十九日电】成都讯：人民解放军第十八兵团司令部、政治部曾于本月十一日召开欢迎成都外围及成都起义军官大会。贺龙司令员亲临讲话。贺司令员首先对起义军官表示热烈欢迎，他说：“人民解放军对待坚决脱离国民党反动派起义的官兵，一向是热诚欢迎的。起义之后，按照人民解放军的制度、原则，经过整编改造，就是人民解放军了；大家应该和解放军紧密地团结起来，要做到推诚相见，由组织上的一致达到思想上的一致，成为真正的人民军队。”
    对于起义部队的改造方针，贺司令员指出：“首先要取消国民党特务工作，建立革命的政治工作，即一切为人民服务、一切为士兵服务的政治工作。各起义部队应即着重进行革命政治教育，把人民解放军和国民党反动军队对比起来，说明两种军队在本质上的不同：人民解放军是人民的军队，是解放人民保护人民的工具；国民党反动派的军队是蒋介石集团的军队，是反对人民压迫人民的工具。起义部队必须把过去由蒋匪领导所养成的欺压人民的恶习，彻底改变，迅速建立为人民服务的思想作风，给人民老老实实当勤务员。只有这样，首先从政治上改造为人民军队，然后进行军事整训才有意义。”
    贺司令员在最后勉励大家虚心学习，改造自己，使每个人都能成为捍卫祖国的人民战士。
