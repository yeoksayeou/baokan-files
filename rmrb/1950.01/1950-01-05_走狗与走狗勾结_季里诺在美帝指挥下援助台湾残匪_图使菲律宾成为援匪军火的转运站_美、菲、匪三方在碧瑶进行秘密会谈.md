Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th Dispatch: While U.S. imperialism is actively helping the Kuomintang bandit gang struggle in Taiwan, the Philippine puppet government, under U.S. command, is also colluding with the remnant bandits in Taiwan, participating in conspiracies against the Chinese people. Many reports reveal that the U.S. government has planned to aid the Chiang bandits in Taiwan through the Quirino government, turning the Philippines into a transit station for military supplies to aid the bandits, and attempting to link the Taiwan bandit gang's defense plans with U.S. military plans in the Philippines. Chiang's "ambassador" to the Philippines, Chen Chih-ping, U.S. Ambassador Cowen, and Philippine President Quirino recently held secret talks in Baguio for this purpose. According to a Kuomintang Central News Agency dispatch from Baguio on December 21st, Chen Chih-ping and Quirino discussed facilitating the Chiang bandits' "purchase of surplus weapons and ammunition in the Philippines and facilitating the transfer of U.S. weapons to Taiwan via the Philippines," as well as "closer exchange of intelligence on common security issues, that is, strengthening the connection between the military efforts of both sides through U.S. aid to Taiwan and the Philippines." On the same day, a Central News Agency dispatch from Manila quoted the Manila Bulletin as saying that the meeting in Baguio between Quirino, Chen Chih-ping, and Cowen "was to connect the defense plans of the three countries in the Far East," and the meeting "particularly emphasized the connection between the Taiwan and Philippines defense plans." According to a United Press International dispatch from Hong Kong on December 21st, citing Kuomintang sources, before attending the Baguio trilateral meeting, Cowen had consulted with U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Stratemeyer and Willoughby, head of MacArthur's headquarters intelligence group, on the Taiwan issue. It is said that Willoughby conveyed MacArthur's ideas on Taiwan to Cowen.

During the Baguio talks, the Philippine Foreign Ministry announced on December 19th the dispatch of Garcia to Taipei to regularly report on the development of the Taiwan base to its own government. At the same time, the Chiang bandit gang decided to open an air route between Taiwan and the Philippines, with Chennault's Air Transport, which has always acted as a henchman in Chiang's bandit civil war, undertaking this flight mission. Chennault Air Transport obtained a landing permit in Manila on December 24th and began flying on December 27th.

    走狗与走狗勾结
    季里诺在美帝指挥下援助台湾残匪
    图使菲律宾成为援匪军火的转运站
    美、菲、匪三方在碧瑶进行秘密会谈
    【新华社北京四日电】和美帝国主义积极援助国民党匪帮在台湾挣扎的同时，菲律宾傀儡政府亦在美国指挥下与台湾残匪勾结，参与反对中国人民的阴谋活动。许多消息披露：美国政府已计划经由季里诺政府援助台湾蒋匪，将菲律宾变成援匪军火的转运站，并企图使台湾匪帮的防守计划和美国在菲律宾的军事计划联系起来。蒋匪驻菲律宾“大使”陈质平及美大使柯温与菲总统季里诺最近曾为此在碧瑶进行秘密会谈。据国民党中央社碧瑶十二月二十一日专电透露：陈质平与季里诺会谈中曾讨论到便利蒋匪“在菲购买剩余武器和军火，并便利美国的武器经由菲律宾运往台湾”，以及“更密切交换关于共同安全问题的情报，即以美国对台菲两地的援助，加强双方军事努力的联系”等问题。同日中央社马尼拉专电又引马尼拉公报的消息说：季里诺和陈质平、柯温在碧瑶的会议，“是为联系三国在远东的防务计划”，该会议曾“特别着重台、菲防务计划的联系”。另据合众社香港十二月二十一日电引国民党方面消息说：柯温在参加碧瑶三角会议之前，曾与远东美空军司令斯特拉特梅耶及麦克阿瑟总部情报组组长威洛贝就台湾问题进行磋商。据称，威洛贝将麦克阿瑟关于台湾的主意转达给柯温。
    在碧瑶会谈期中，菲律宾外交部于十二月十九日宣布了派遣加尔西亚到台北担任经常向其本国政府报告台湾基地发展情况的任务。同时蒋匪帮即决定开辟台湾和菲律宾间的航空线，由一向充当蒋匪内战帮凶的陈纳德航空队担任此项飞行任务；陈纳德空运队已于十二月二十四日取得了在马尼拉着陆的许可证，并于二十七日开始飞行。
