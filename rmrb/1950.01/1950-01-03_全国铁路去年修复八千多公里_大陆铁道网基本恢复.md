Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 2nd:

The restoration of China's People's Railways in 1949 achieved great success, writing a glorious and brilliant first page for the restoration and development of China's economy. According to statistics from the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, the nation's 500,000 railway employees and commanders and soldiers of the Railway Corps repaired more than 8,200 kilometers of railway lines in 1949, exceeding the plan at the beginning of last year by three times. Of the original railways on mainland China, all lines have been fully restored and opened to traffic, except for the Jinzhou-Gubeikou and Yebaishou-Chifeng lines in the Northeast, the northern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway in North China, and the Guilin-Dushan section of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway in South China. The total length of China's railways (including Taiwan and Hainan Island) is 26,857 kilometers, of which 24,794 kilometers had been liberated by the end of 1949, and 21,046 kilometers were open to traffic. The mileage open to traffic increased by approximately 80 percent compared to the end of 1948.

Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, there had been no railway network in the area of mainland China within Shanhaiguan. All major railways, i.e., the north-south Tianjin-Pukou, Beijing-Hankou, and Guangdong-Hankou lines, and the east-west Longhai and Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines, had not been fully open to traffic for several years, or even more than a decade. However, in 1949 alone, with the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army, the nation's railway employees and the Railway Corps established with Northeast railway employees as the backbone, also advanced victoriously under Chairman Mao's call to "build railways wherever the Liberation Army advances," rapidly repairing the major railway lines within Shanhaiguan and restoring and reorganizing the railway network within Shanhaiguan.

From January to October, the major administrative regions were connected, supporting the People's Liberation Army's southward crossing of the Yangtze River and the large-scale advances to the southeast, south, northwest, and southwest.

From the National First Railway Conference convened by the Ministry of Railways on January 15th of last year to the Second Railway Engineering Conference at the end of March, the national railway mileage restored to traffic in two and a half months was 1,080 li. The main areas included the railways around Beijing and Tianjin in the north, including the lines from Beijing to Shanhaiguan, to Zhangjiakou, to Zhuozhou on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, and from Tianjin to Dezhou. The restoration of these railways connected the Northeast and North China, and the cities and villages of North China, supporting the People's Liberation Army's southward crossing of the Yangtze River.

From the Second Engineering Conference to the Third Engineering Conference on October 15th of last year, the national railway mileage restored to traffic in six and a half months was 4,475 kilometers. This included the full lines of the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan, Tianjin-Pukou, and Shanghai-Nanjing Railways, the Zhuozhou-Baoding and Zhengzhou-Hankou sections of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the sections east of Luoyang and from Tongguan to Baoji on the Longhai Railway, the central section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, the full line of the Jiaoji Railway, the full line of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and the eastern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and the northern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railways. The restoration of these railways connected the major administrative regions and major cities of the country, strengthened the national exchange of materials, and supported the People's Liberation Army's large-scale advances to the southeast, south, northwest, and southwest. In particular, the direct through train service between Beijing and Shenyang on "May Day" last year, and the direct through train service between Beijing and Shanghai on "July 1" last year, played a decisive role in the entry of grain into Shanhaiguan, the transport of coal from the north to the south, the exchange of materials between the north and the south, and in helping Shanghai and Central China overcome economic difficulties and break the blockade.

From October to the end of the year, the main railways of the country were connected, and the capital and major cities of the country were closely linked.

In October of last year, Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan called at the National Third Engineering Conference to restore the full lines of the Beijing-Hankou, Guangdong-Hankou, Longhai, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railways and the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway before the end of 1949, connecting the major railways of the country. The nation's railway employees and commanders and soldiers of the Railway Corps responded immediately, and with the technical assistance of Soviet railway engineering experts, worked hard to complete the task before the end of the year; and, beyond the plan, repaired 360 kilometers of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway and other huge projects. In these two and a half months, 2,655 kilometers of railways were repaired. By this point, the original railway network of the country was basically restored.

With the opening of direct trains on the Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Hankou, Beijing-Manzhouli, Beijing-Qingdao, Beijing-Taiyuan, Beijing-Baotou, Guangdong-Hankou, and Xi'an-Xuzhou lines, the capital and all parts and cities of the country were closely connected. The basic restoration of the national railway network has linked the front and the rear, the cities along the railway lines and the vast countryside, and the factories and mines into a whole, which will play a great role in supporting the People's Liberation Army in liberating Tibet, Hainan Island, and Taiwan, and in the country's economic construction.

The repair of more than 8,200 kilometers of railways was carried out under extremely difficult conditions of national finances, equipment, and materials. Among them, 3,569 kilometers of lines were severely damaged, almost requiring reconstruction. It also included more than 1,900 bridges (not including the Northeast) with a total length of 75,529 meters. But the heroic and hardworking Chinese railway workers, with the assistance of farmers along the line and the technical guidance of Soviet experts, created an astonishing speed of repair. In the repair of the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, a maximum record of laying 12 kilometers of track per day was created; and in bridge construction, a high speed of driving 86 piles per day and repairing 45 meters of bridge was also created.

The construction work of the People's Railways in 1949 not only achieved amazing results in repairing the damaged original lines, but also achieved rapid development in road maintenance, locomotive, train operation, vehicle dispatching, and management and business; in particular, the experience of learning from the Soviet Union's advanced railway management work. The acquisition of these achievements guaranteed the heavy military transport tasks and national commercial and passenger transport in 1949, and laid a solid foundation for the construction of the new China's People's Railway network.

    全国铁路去年修复八千多公里  大陆铁道网基本恢复
    前方和后方、城市和农村、工厂和矿山连成一个整体，对支援大军解放西藏、海南岛、台湾，对全国经济建设，均将起伟大作用。
    【新华社北京二日电】一九四九年我国人民铁道的恢复获得了伟大的成就，为我国经济的恢复和发展，写下了光辉灿烂的第一页。据中央人民政府铁道部统计，全国五十万铁路员工和铁道兵团的指战员，在一九四九年内，共修复了八千二百多公里的铁路线，超过去年年初计划的三倍。我国大陆上原有的铁路，除东北锦州至古北口，叶柏寿至赤峰两线，华北同蒲铁路的北段和华南湘桂黔铁路桂林至都匀线以外，其余所有线路均已全部修复通车。我国铁路总长为（包括台湾、海南岛在内）二万六千八百五十七公里，在一九四九年底已解放者为二万四千七百九十四公里，已通车者为二万一千零四十六公里。通车里程比一九四八年底增加了约百分之八十。
    我国大陆山海关以内的地区，自一九三七年抗日战争爆发以来，即不复有铁路网的存在。所有主要铁路，即纵贯南北的津浦、京汉、粤汉等线，横贯东西的陇海、浙赣等线，少则数年来、多则十余年来没有全线通车。但在一九四九年一年之内，随着人民解放军的胜利前进，全国铁路员工和以东北铁路员工为基干建立起来的铁路兵团，在毛主席提出的“解放军打到那里，铁路修到那里”的号召下，也胜利前进，迅速修复了关内的各主要铁路线，恢复并重整了关内的铁道网。
    一月至十月沟通了各大行政区，支援了解放军南下渡江作战及向东南华南西北西南大进军。
    计自去年一月十五日铁道部召开全国第一次铁道会议到去年三月底第二次铁道工务会议时，两个月半时间内全国修复通车的铁路为一千零八十里。其中主要区北方京、津两市周围的铁路，包括北京至山海关、至张家口、至京汉路的涿县和天津至德州等线。这些铁路的修复，沟通了东北和华北，沟通了华北的城市和乡村，支援了人民解放军的南下渡江作战。
    第二次工务会议到去年十月十五日第三次工务会议时，六个月半时间内全国修复通车的铁路为四千四百七十五公里。其中包括沈（阳）山（海关）路、津浦路和沪宁路的全线，京汉铁路涿州至保定和郑州至汉口两段，陇海路的洛阳以东和潼关至宝鸡两段，同蒲中段，胶济路全线，沪杭路全线，以及浙赣东段、粤汉北段等路。这些铁路的修复，沟通了全国各大行政区和各大城市，加强了全国的物资交流，支援了人民解放军向东南、华南、西北、西南的大进军。特别是去年“五一”的京沈直达通车，和去年“七一”的京沪直达通车，对于粮食入关、北煤南运、南北物资交流，对于帮助上海和华中克服经济困难，粉碎封锁，起了决定的作用。
    十月到年底全国主要铁路接通，首都和全国主要城市紧密连结起来。
    去年十月间，铁道部滕代远部长在全国第三次工务会议上，号召于一九四九年底前，修复京汉、粤汉、陇海、浙赣全线和同蒲南段，接通全国各主要铁路。全国铁路员工和铁道兵团的指战员们立起响应，在苏联铁路工程专家的技术帮助下，奋勇赶修，终于在年底以前，先后完成了任务；并在计划以外，修复了湘桂黔铁路三百六十公里的路线，和其他巨大的工程。在这两个月半的时间内，有二千六百五十五公里的铁路已经修复。至此，全国原有铁路网基本上即告恢复。
    由于京沪、京汉、京满（洲里）、京青（岛），京太（原）、京包（头）、粤汉、西（安）徐（州）等线直达列车的开行，首都和全国各地各城市便紧密地连接起来了。全国铁路网的基本恢复，使前方和后方，铁路沿线的城市和广大农村，工厂和矿山已连系成一个整体，对于支援人民解放军解放西藏、海南岛和台湾，对于全国的经济建设，均将起其伟大的作用。
    修复八千二百余公里的铁路，是在国家财政和设备、器材极端困难的条件之下进行的。其中有三千五百六十九公里的线路被破坏极重，几同重建。而且还包括总延长达七万五千五百二十九公尺的一千九百多座桥梁（东北不在内）。但英勇勤劳的中国铁路工人，他们在沿线农民的援助下，在苏联专家的技术指导下，创造了修复工程的惊人速度。同蒲南段的修复中创造了每天铺轨十二公里的最高纪录；在修桥中也创造了每天打桩八十六根、修桥四十五公尺的高速度。
    一九四九年人民铁道的建设工作，不仅在修复被破坏了的原有线路上获得了惊人的成绩，在养路工程上，在机务、乘务、车辆调度，以及管理、营业等各方面均获得了飞跃地发展；特别是学习了苏联先进的铁路管理工作的经验。这些成绩的获得，保证了一九四九年繁重的军运任务和全国的商旅运输，并为新中国人民铁道网的建设工作，奠定了坚实的基础。
