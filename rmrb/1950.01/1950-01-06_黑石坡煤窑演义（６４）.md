    The Black Rock Slope Coal Mine Chronicles (64)
    Kang Tuo
    The next day, the village convened a joint meeting of the poor peasant league, the workers' and peasants' association representatives, and the group leaders at the old Temple of the Masses. Many people also voluntarily participated, numbering about two hundred. At the meeting, Old Yin formally announced the establishment of the Communist Party branch in Black Rock Slope Village and introduced the names of eight party members, including Shuan Cheng, Bian Xiao, and Tian Lu, soliciting everyone's opinions; after whispering amongst themselves, everyone unanimously said: "No objections! They are all good people!" Old Yin then gave the party members a round of education, calling on everyone to always take the lead and serve the villagers well. Finally, he also said a few words to the masses. Old Bai also spoke about a few points. In the end, Old Yin asked if anyone had anything to say, and Da San came forward to speak.
    Da San's speech today was different from usual. He first straightened his clothes and hat, coughed twice, and then slowly said: "Folks, let me, Zhang Yuanlu, say a few words. In my opinion, today is the most joyous day in our village's history, even more joyous than the land distribution and the ventilation shaft! Our village has suffered oppression and exploitation from feudal landlords, Yan Xishan, Japanese devils, and foreign devils for generations. Nine and a half out of ten people in the village have been poor for generations! Many families have been oppressed to the point of extinction, and many bachelors cannot afford to marry and have families! We cannot turn ourselves around by begging to the heavens and worshipping the earth, or by respecting the Old Lord, and we will still be exploited even if we resent the heavens and the earth and blame the Old Lord! We are poor whether we lick people's boots or argue with them! Except for Bian Xiao, we are all surnamed Zhang here! We are all uncles, grandpas, nephews, and brothers! But were we really one family in the past? No, we were two families, one called landlords, rich men, and feudalists, and the other called dead poor people and stinking poor people! Our dead poor people and stinking poor people sold our lives and sweated day and night, year after year, generation after generation, feeding the rich men until they were fat and strong, while we ourselves had nothing to eat and nothing to wear. Some people couldn't afford to marry and have families their whole lives, and those who did were worried to death about their children! What kind of life were we living! Could we withstand being Zhang Jubao's livestock?" Da San paused, and everyone lowered their heads without saying a word. Da San then grabbed his tattered hat, waved his hand, and said again: "But now it's different! The Communist Party has come, and our dead poor people are alive, our stinking poor people are fragrant, and even the Old Lord has submitted to us! We have all turned over! Take me, Zhang Yuanlu, for example! I have traveled all over the country, and although I don't have any skills, I have a body of bones and flesh, and my energy is not small. I have been down the kiln for thirty years, relying on a stubborn temper. I have never killed or stolen from anyone, but what did I get? I was not allowed to go down the kiln by the kiln boss, I offended the Old Lord and was driven out of the village, and everyone in the village was implicated with me, and if I had died, I would have had no descendants! Humph! I haven't died yet, and the Communist Party has come! This time, even though I didn't want land, I was given an acre to plant squash, my house was returned to me, and I was given grain and furniture! I was also allowed to go down the kiln again! Look, I am also wearing new clothes, and I am forty-eight or forty-nine years old, and I am even engaged in a voluntary marriage: Isn't this emancipation? Aren't all of you the same as me?" Da San paused again, and this time everyone raised their heads and looked at him. He said again: "And that's not all! We have also been given a treasure! In the past, I always relied on my skills, charging straight ahead, and rarely submitted to anyone. I also never licked anyone's boots. Whoever didn't obey me, I would take a tough attitude, and whoever was agreeable to me, I would befriend. I stubbornly clung to the kiln, and although I had opened kilns, I had also ruined them. Now? Saying that I never licked anyone's boots, saying that I stubbornly clung to the big kiln, saying that I had some skills, but when we were first liberated, I didn't work hard, I fell behind, I was stubborn, and I was even less progressive than the people I looked down on! No matter how strong my skills are, a tough attitude just won't get things done! Look at my second brother, he has been silent his whole life, always afraid of every little thing. He also stubbornly clung to the kiln! But how fast he has progressed! He silently accomplished things that I couldn't accomplish! My second brother suggested that those who dig small kilns should dig 'sevens'. If it were my temper in the past, I wouldn't have allowed it! But at that time, I was thinking that maybe my temper wasn't working, so okay, let's let people try it! Once we tried it, I couldn't help but be convinced! My brother Xilu and Lin Bao, at such an old age, can still work hard at night in the mine! Tai Cheng and Yu Bao, not only worked for Jubao in the past, but also ruined kilns. I looked down on them! But Tai Cheng's output from the west kiln was even more than I calculated! Yu Bao's suggestions for the ventilation shaft were also pretty good! Even Niu Bao and that bunch of blockheads are moving like they know what they are doing! What is the reason for this! This is the result of holding meetings and talking about democracy, the power shown by the people! Once I understood this, I also changed my bad habits, and everyone worked together to make the kiln, opening the ventilation shaft. This is also the fruit we have gained! Don't you think so?" Below, there was a noisy discussion: "That's right!" "That's true!"... Da San continued: "How did all these fruits come about? This is the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao! Without the Communist Party, there would be nothing! Today, not only have we turned over under the leadership of the Communist Party, but the village also has a Party, and the best people in the village are in the Party. From now on, our village will be emancipated forever, and this can be considered a solid foundation! Everyone, this is a joyous event for our village, isn't it? I, Zhang Yuanlu, know that I have many shortcomings, but I sincerely want to join the Party, I sincerely want to follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, contribute my strength, and do my part. Do you think I have enough qualifications? Even if I don't have enough for now, I will definitely make progress in the future, and I will definitely learn from the Party members."

    黑石坡煤窑演义（６４）
    康濯
    第二天，村里在老群庙上召集了一个贫农团、工农会代表和小组长的合伙会，群众自动参加的也很多，许有二百号人。会上，老尹正式宣布了黑石坡村共产党支部成立，并介绍了拴成、扁小、天禄等八个党员的名字，征求大家的意见；大家三个两个悄悄捣拉了一阵，都一音说道：“没意见！通是好样的！”老尹接着就对党员进行了一阵教育，号召大家要处处走在头里，好好给浑村大伙办事，末了并对群众们也说了些话；老白也讲了讲几点意见。最后，老尹问询大家有什么说的，大三这时就出来说了话。
    大三今天说话比往日不同，他先整了整衣帽，咳嗽了两声，才慢腾腾地说：“大伙，我张远禄说两句话。依着咱说，今个是咱村亘古以来头一个最喜气的日子，这比分地土透风筒喜气还大！咱村祖祖辈辈受封建老财阎锡山日本洋鬼的压迫剥削，村里十个人就有九个半祖祖辈辈受穷；还有好多人家被压迫得绝了户，好多光棍汉娶不起家口绝了户！咱们求天拜地敬老君爷也翻不了身，怨天怨地怨老君爷也还是受人剥削！咱溜舐人家也是穷，跟人闹蹩扭还是穷！咱们这里除了扁小，可都是一家子姓张的呀！都是叔叔大爷侄儿弟兄呀！可往日咱们真是一家村子么？不，咱们是两家，一家叫地主老财封建，一家叫死穷人臭穷人！咱们死穷人臭穷人祖祖辈辈年年月月白天黑夜卖命流汗，养得老财们又肥又壮，咱自己倒吃没吃穿没穿，有的一辈子娶不起家口，娶了家口的又为孩孩娃娃愁煞人！咱们过的是什么光景啊！咱能顶住了张聚宝的牲口么？”大三停了停，人们一个个都低着头不啃声，大三就抓下破礼帽撒手一挥，又说：“可如今不同了！共产党来了，咱死穷人活了，臭穷人香了，老君爷也服了咱了！都翻身了！就拿我张远禄说吧！我走遍山南海北，虽说没有一身本事，可也一身骨头肉，劲气也不小，三十来年下窑，仗凭一股硬脾性，没杀过人偷过人，可落了个什么？落了个窑黑不让下窑，落了个得罪老君爷给撵出村，落得浑村大伙还跟着我背害，落得我死球啦两腿一伸就绝了户！哼！我还没死，共产党就来了！这回我不要地的也分了一亩栽窝瓜的地，房也分回啦，粮食家具也分啦，又让我下了窑！大伙看，我也穿上了新衣裳，我四十八九的人啦，还两相情愿订了亲：我这不是翻身解放么？咱大伙不也跟我这一样样么？”大三又停住了，人们这回是个个抬头望着他，他又说：“还不止这些！咱还分得了一样宝贝物件！往日我总凭仗我这把式，直冲直撞，轻易不肯服人，也起根没溜舐过人，谁不服咱就动态度，谁对心眼咱就交朋友；咱死啃住窑不放，虽说也开成过窑，可也不是没闹坏过窑。这会呢？说咱没溜舐过人，说咱死啃住大窑不放，说咱满有点把式，可刚解放那会咱还工作不靠前，死落后，耍蹩扭，比咱瞧不起的人还不进步！我把式再强，动态度可就是办不成事！看看咱老二，一辈子不言不语，光怕风吹草动的，他也是死啃住窑不放哩！可他进步多快！他不声不响就办成了咱办不成的事！咱老二提意见，叫让刨硔窑的刨‘七’，要是我过去那脾性，咱还不准听不听哩！可那阵子我心眼里正思谋着咱的脾性许是使不的，好吧，咱让人家试吧试吧吧！这一试吧，就不由的我不信服！咱喜禄哥跟林宝，那么大年岁，熬夜弄武地也一样干！咱泰成跟玉宝，过去不光给聚宝干过事，也都闹坏了窑，我挺瞧不上他们！可泰成西窑出炭比我计算的还多！玉宝给风筒行道提的意见也挺不赖！就连牛宝和干大脑那伙，动弹得也像个模样！这是什么缘由！这是开会讲民主，是老百姓当权显出的力量！我明白了这，我也好赖改了改自己的毛病，大伙这才跟咱一道闹成了窑，透开了风筒。这可也是咱得的果实呀！大伙说不是么？”下边不觉乱哄哄捣拉起来：“对！”“这话不假！”……大三又道：“这一切果实是怎么来的呀？这是共产党毛主席领导来的！要没共产党，就啥也没有！今个咱们不光是共产党领导翻了身，村里还有了党，党里边又都是咱村里最好样的人，往后咱村长年永辈的翻身解放，这可算是稳扎根基了！大伙说，这不是咱村的大喜气事么？我张远禄是自知毛病不小，可我是实心实意要求参加党，我是实心实意要跟着共产党毛主席，尽一份力量，办一份工作。大伙看我够不够材料？反正就是这阵子不够，往后咱也一定要往好里进步，一定要跟党员们学。”
