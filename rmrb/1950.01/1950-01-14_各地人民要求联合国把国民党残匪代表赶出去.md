Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 13th: People and newspapers in various parts of the country unanimously support the solemn demand made by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government on the 8th, that the United Nations Security Council expel the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group. The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in Central China telegraphed: "Foreign Minister Zhou's proposal represents the will of all the Chinese people. We hope that the member states of the United Nations Security Council will immediately discuss and accept it." The Working Committee of the Communist Youth League in Central and Southern China telegraphed: "We, the 30 million youth in the Central and Southern China region, resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's demand and hope that all friends who are willing to be friendly with the new China will unite to drive the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group out of the United Nations!" Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the Central and Southern China Military and Political Committee, Committee Member Tang Shengzhi, and representatives from workers, youth, women, education, and business circles in Kaifeng, Changsha, Nanchang, Qingdao and other places have expressed their firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn proposal, which represents the will of all the Chinese people.
In addition to publishing Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram to the UN Security Council in a prominent position, newspapers in Shanghai and Hankou also published editorials. Shanghai Xinwen Ribao's editorial stated: "We firmly support the solemn position expressed by Foreign Minister Zhou on China's foreign policy and demand that Chiang Ting-fu and other bandit gang representatives be immediately expelled from the United Nations Security Council." The editorials of Wenhui Bao and Ta Kung Pao both believe that Foreign Minister Zhou's proposal is in line with the demands of the Chinese people and progressive people around the world, and the United Nations Security Council should accept this just demand. An editorial in the Hankou Changjiang Daily rebuked the reactionary groups headed by US imperialism for continuing to accommodate the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary group in the United Nations organization. An editorial in Dagang Bao believes that the Kuomintang bandit government has long ceased to exist, and it is a disgrace to the United Nations to allow the representatives of this small group of bandits to exist in the United Nations.

    各地人民要求联合国把国民党残匪代表赶出去
    【新华社北京十三日电】国内各地人民及报纸一致拥护中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长八日要求联合国安全理事会开除国民党反动派残余集团代表的严正主张。华中总工会筹委会通电称：“周外长的建议代表了全中国人民的意志，我们希望联合国安全理事会各会员国立即加以讨论和接受。”青年团中南工作委员会通电称：“我们中南区三千万青年坚决拥护周外长的要求，并希望一切愿意和新中国友好的朋友联合起来，把国民党反动残余集团的代表赶出联合国去！”中南区军政委员会副主席程潜、委员唐生智和开封、长沙、南昌、青岛等地的工人、青年、妇女、教育、工商各界代表都纷纷表示坚决拥护周外长这一项代表中国全体人民意志的严正主张。
    沪汉各报除于首要地位刊出周外长致联合国安理会的电文外，并各发表社论。上海新闻日报社论说：“我们坚决拥护周外长所表示中国外交上的严正立场，要求立即把蒋廷黻等匪帮代表开除出联合国安理会去。”文汇报和大公报的社论都认为，周外长的建议是符合中国人民和世界进步人民的要求的，联合国安理会应该接受这一正义的要求。汉口长江日报的时评斥责以美帝国主义为首的反动集团继续收容国民党反动集团的代表在联合国组织内。大刚报社论认为国民党匪帮政府早已不存在，联合国中容许这一小撮土匪集团的代表存在，是联合国的耻辱。
