Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 4th: Deputy Minister of Education Qian Junrui delivered a summary report at the National Education Work Conference on December 31st. The main points are as follows:

    I. This conference has been successful. Everyone at the meeting reflected on the situation of education work in various regions and the existing problems, exchanged important experiences regarding education work in the old and new areas, discussed the Ministry of Education's work plan for the first half of 1950, and reached a consensus on issues such as establishing the Renmin University of China and worker-peasant rapid middle schools, improving Beijing Normal University, compiling and reviewing textbooks for middle and primary schools, and striving to unite and transform intellectuals.

    Building a New Democratic Education Based on the Experience of New Education in the Old Liberated Areas, Absorbing Useful Experience from the Old Education, and Using Soviet Experience.

    II. Building the New Education of the People's Republic of China is a long-term struggle. China's New Education, just like China's New Politics and New Economy, began more than twenty years ago in the old liberated areas (i.e., the land revolutionary base areas). After the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao's cultural and educational policies, it has made significant progress and accumulated considerable experience, especially in mass education, ideological transformation education for intellectuals, and rural primary school education. This New Education is national, scientific, and mass-based. Its method is the unity of theory and practice, and its purpose is to serve the people, first and foremost the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to serve the current revolutionary struggle and construction.

    However, the experience of these old liberated areas is the product of a long-term rural and wartime environment. Now, the vast majority of the country has been liberated, and the main task in the future will shift from war to comprehensive construction. In the face of the national construction task, our education must, in accordance with the Common Program, base itself on the good experience of the original New Education, absorb some useful experience from the old education, and especially draw on the advanced experience of Soviet education construction to build our New Democratic Education, "with the main task of improving the people's cultural level, cultivating talents for national construction, eradicating feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies, and developing the idea of serving the people."

    Establishing Renmin University to Cultivate Construction Talents is the Starting Point for a Completely New Type of Higher Education.

    At the same time, universally run worker-peasant rapid middle schools to train worker-peasant cadres into intellectuals.

    For this purpose, we should carry out a series of specific tasks. Among these tasks is the plan to establish Renmin University, which we discussed at this meeting and the State Council decided upon. The task of establishing Renmin University is to accept the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and systematically and step by step cultivate various construction cadres for New China. Not only young intellectuals will participate in the study at this university, but also worker-peasant youth and cadres will be absorbed. This will be the starting point for a completely new type of higher education in New China.

    We discussed another extremely important task at this meeting, which is the universal establishment of worker-peasant rapid middle schools. We require that troops, government agencies, organizations, and schools across the country do their best to run such rapid middle schools for young workers and peasants, especially for young and adult worker-peasant cadres who have participated in the revolutionary struggle for many years. This group of worker-peasant cadres is the most valuable asset of our motherland, and we must be responsible for cultivating them into intellectuals and training them to bear the task of construction. For the same reason, we should extensively conduct worker's spare-time literacy education.

    Strive to begin literacy education on a national scale next year.

    In addition, we must make the necessary preparations for carrying out literacy education on a national scale and eliminating the great task of illiteracy. Chairman Mao said, "Eliminating illiteracy from 80 percent of the population is a necessary condition for building a New China." We must strive to create this condition so that the working masses can easily grasp culture and science as weapons for struggle and construction, and as weapons for consolidating and developing the people's democratic dictatorship. In all regions of the country, preparations should be made for literacy education materials and for organizing teachers among the masses, striving to start a nationwide literacy movement from 1951.

    The development direction of New China's education is the correct combination of popularization and improvement, that is, improving on the basis of popularization and popularizing under the guidance of improvement. Popularization is of course mainly aimed at workers, peasants, and soldiers, but it also does not relax the promotion of general children's education. On the basis of such popularization, from literacy education and basic political, cultural, and scientific education, it will be improved to higher-level science and technology and political education.

    Education in the old areas is now focused on consolidation and improvement, solving the problems of teachers and teaching materials.

    III. Education in the old liberated areas, especially primary and secondary education, has seen great development after the land reform. Due to the limitations of human and financial resources, it should now focus on consolidation and improvement. When conditions permit, certain developments can be made in response to the needs of the masses. It should be recognized that this is the eve of a new great development, and this new great development will constitute an important part of the cultural upsurge that will inevitably come. It is wrong not to do this consolidation and improvement; it is also wrong not to prepare the conditions for tomorrow's great development at this stage.

    The key to consolidation and improvement is the proper resolution of the issues of teachers and teaching materials. The problem with teachers now is insufficient quantity and insufficient quality. This has led to the task of improving Beijing Normal University and the teachers' colleges or education colleges in universities in various regions, improving the teacher education in various places, and strengthening teacher training and on-the-job learning, so as to cultivate a large number of qualified teachers.

    In order to solve the problem of teaching materials, this meeting decided on a specific plan to strengthen the work of compiling and reviewing textbooks, and we must strive to promote its realization.

    In order to train a large number of intermediate-level construction cadres, secondary schools should focus on developing into secondary technical schools in the next few years.

    The key to education work in the new areas is to strive to unite and transform intellectuals. In addition, the original schools must be maintained and gradually improved.

    IV. Striving to unite and transform intellectuals is the key to education work in the new areas. Chairman Mao told us that "the attitude towards old cultural workers, old education workers, and old doctors is to adopt appropriate methods to educate them, so that they can acquire new viewpoints and new methods and serve the Chinese people." Comrade Ren Bishi said in his speech "Several Questions in Land Reform" that the democratic regime should adopt a policy of protecting general intellectuals, and should try its best to win them over to serve the People's Republic. "As long as they express their willingness to abide by the laws of the democratic government, especially the Land Law, do not oppose the policies of the Communist Party, are willing to serve the people, and do not carry out sabotage activities, and are willing to be subject to the government's legal sanctions if they commit illegal acts, we can let them come out to work. Various training classes can be organized to train them in technology and politics, slowly transform them, and then assign them appropriate jobs." We must resolutely and correctly implement this policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals. We should prevent the left-leaning deviations that once occurred against intellectuals in rent reduction and land reform, that is, rejecting all intellectuals and closing down a large number of schools. Most of China's intellectuals are connected with the land, and they are wavering in the struggle of land reform, but their position can be changed through education. We must first conduct land reform education for them in advance and strive for their active participation in or support of the work of land reform.

    In the new areas, we should resolutely implement the policy of maintaining the original schools and gradually making possible and necessary improvements. The so-called maintenance means that wherever we go, we must not allow the destruction or damage of the equipment and buildings of these schools, so that the general original teachers can continue to teach with peace of mind, and then improve them in a planned and step-by-step manner, and never adopt an advanced and adventurous policy.

    Efforts should be made to resettle unemployed intellectuals. All regions should try to prevent a large number of young students from dropping out of school; if there is a phenomenon of dropping out of school, it should be properly resolved. This is an important issue in the new areas, and we should treat and handle this issue very seriously.

    V. The main task after the settlement of schools in the new areas is to conduct political and ideological education among teachers and young students in a planned and step-by-step manner, the main purpose of which is to gradually establish a revolutionary outlook on life.

    The main task after the settlement of schools in the new areas is to conduct political and ideological education.

    This education is part of national education, and its basic nature is New Democratic, not yet socialist. This education must first oppose comprador, feudal, and fascist ideologies and establish the idea of serving the people. But in order to establish and consolidate the idea of serving the people, the study of Marxism-Leninism world outlook and Mao Zedong Thought should be promoted and encouraged. The purpose of this promotion and study is to ensure and implement the New Democratic construction in the current historical period, and it is not to demand the immediate realization of socialism. Chairman Mao said, "We should both distinguish the propaganda of the communist ideological system and social system from the practice of the action program of New Democracy, and we should distinguish the communist method of observing problems, studying knowledge, and handling work from the New Democratic policy of national culture. It is undoubtedly very inappropriate to confuse the two."

    According to the experience of various places, in order to effectively carry out political and ideological education, first, theoretical learning must be closely combined with the students' actual thoughts, that is, theoretical learning is used as a weapon to transform thoughts, and transforming thoughts is used as the direct purpose of theoretical learning. Second, it is necessary to grasp the key points. Solve the main ideological problems. The curriculum should be based on the principle of being small and refined. The basic point of ideological transformation is to establish a revolutionary outlook on life. Third, promote free thinking, be good at democratic enlightenment, and correctly use criticism and self-criticism. Fourth, for different specific objects, promote the correct or relatively correct components of their own thoughts, and overcome their incorrect thoughts through their own strength, both internally and externally, and gradually improve and consolidate their relatively correct thoughts. Fifth, this kind of learning should be combined with their own participation in labor production, participation in mass struggles, visits to the People's Liberation Army or factories, etc., in order to achieve great results.

    Accumulate experience and gradually reform the old education system.

    VI. The Common Program stipulates that "the People's Government shall reform the old education system, education content, and teaching methods in a planned and step-by-step manner." This is an arduous task. Transforming the old education and building the new education are two closely related and inseparable processes. The former must be carried out under the guidance of the latter; and the construction of the new education must also absorb reasonable elements from the old education.

    The reform of the old school system is a relatively long-term process, and a relatively comprehensive reform can only be achieved after the continuous reform of education at all levels and the accumulation of relatively mature experience. We cannot be impatient. The curriculum in universities and middle schools must continue to be reformed. The focus of the reform is to strengthen revolutionary political learning and rationally streamline the existing curriculum. The key is to get teachers to think clearly. The reform of teaching methods should focus on opposing dogmatism that separates books from practice, and at the same time prevent narrow utilitarianism that despises the study of basic theory. It is necessary to resolutely move towards the unity of theory and practice. The examination system must be improved. The management of the school must correctly implement democratic centralism.

    For private schools run by Chinese people, the general policy is to protect, maintain, strengthen leadership, and gradually transform.

    VII. Under the current conditions, for private schools run by Chinese people, except for those that are extremely bad and should be banned or taken over, the general policy should be to protect, maintain, strengthen leadership, and gradually transform. It is inappropriate to order a shutdown or takeover without necessity. We should reward or subsidize private schools with excellent results; we should rectify and transform private schools that are purely for profit, so that they can gradually implement New Democratic education, implement democratic management and economic openness; private schools with financial difficulties but good results should be subsidized.

    VIII. At present, the country's finances are still very difficult, but we have ways and hope. The lives of education workers at all levels are difficult, and we should try to improve their material and political treatment as much as possible. Special difficulties should be taken care of for female teachers. But our education workers themselves, in this great era, should carry forward the style of hard struggle, have a global perspective and a historical perspective, fully recognize the importance of their tasks, redouble their enthusiasm and creativity, cultivate and consolidate the spirit of dedication to education, overcome all difficulties, and complete their glorious historical mission.

    在全国教育工作会议上  钱俊瑞副部长总结报告要点
    【新华社北京四日电】教育部钱俊瑞副部长十二月三十一日在全国教育工作会议上作总结报告，要点如下：
    一、这次会议是有成绩的。大家在会议上反映了各地区教育工作的情况和目前所存在着的问题，交换了关于老区与新区的教育工作中若干重要的经验，讨论了中央教育部一九五○年上半年的工作计划，并在创办中国人民大学和工农速成中学，改进北京师范大学，编审中、小学教材，争取团结改造知识分子等项问题上达到了一致的意见。
    以老解放区新教育经验为基础，吸收旧教育有用经验，借助苏联经验，建设新民主主义教育。
    二、建设中华人民共和国的新教育是一个长期的奋斗过程。中国的新教育，正和中国的新政治、新经济一样，开始于二十多年前的老解放区（即当时的土地革命根据地），经过八年抗日战争与三年多解放战争，在毛主席的文教政策领导下，有了重要的发展，并积蓄了不少的经验，尤其在民众教育、知识分子的思想改造教育、农村小学教育等方面。这种新教育是民族的、科学的、大众的教育，其方法是理论与实际一致，其目的是为人民服务，首先为工农兵服务，为当前的革命斗争与建设服务。
    但这些老解放区的经验是长期农村环境与战争环境中的产物。现在全国的绝大部分都已解放，今后主要的任务将由战争转入全面的建设。在全国范围的建设任务前面，我们的教育必须根据共同纲领，以原有的新教育的良好经验为基础，吸收旧教育的某些有用的经验，特别要借助苏联教育建设的先进经验，建设我们的“以提高人民文化水平，培养国家建设人才，肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，发展为人民服务的思想为主要任务”的新民主主义教育。
    创办人民大学，培养建设人材，这是完全新式的高等教育的起点。
    同时普遍举办工农速成中学，把工农干部培养成知识分子。
    为此目的，我们应当进行一系列的具体工作。在这些工作当中，包括我们在这次会上所讨论的、政务院所决定的创办人民大学的计划。创办人民大学的任务，是接受苏联的先进经验，有计划、有步骤地培养新中国的各种建设干部。参加这个大学学习的，不仅有青年知识分子，还要吸收工农青年和干部。这将是新中国的完全新式的高等教育的起点。
    我们在这次会议上讨论了另一项极其重要的工作，就是普遍举办工农速成中学。我们要求全国的部队、机关、团体和学校都尽可能地为青年工农，首先是为多年参加革命斗争的青年和成年工农干部，办这样的速成中学。这批工农干部乃是我们祖国最宝贵的财产，我们必须负责将他们培养成为知识分子，培养他们负担建设任务。为着同样的理由，我们应该大量办理工人业余补习教育。
            争取明年开始，进行全国规模的识字教育。
    此外，我们还要作必要的准备，以便在全国范围内进行识字教育，扫除文盲的伟大工作。毛主席说过：“从百分之八十的人口中扫除文盲，是建立新中国的必要条件。”我们必须努力创设这个条件，以便工农大众易于掌握文化科学，作为斗争与建设的武器，作为巩固与发展人民民主专政的武器。在全国各个地区，应该着手准备识字教育的教材和组织群众中的师资，争取从一九五一年开始，进行全国规模的识字运动。
    新中国教育的发展方针是普及与提高的正确结合，即在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及。普及当然以工农兵为主要对象，但是也不放松一般儿童教育的推广。在这样普及的基础上，从识字教育和基本政治文化科学教育，提高到较高级的科学技术和政治教育。
            老区教育，现在以巩固与提高为主，解决师资、教材问题。
    三、老解放区的教育，首先是中小教育，在土地改革后有了大的发展。由于人力财力的限制，现在应以巩固与提高为主。在条件许可时，可顺应群众需要作某些发展。应该认识：这是新的大发展的前夜，这个新的大发展，将构成必然会到来的文化高潮的重要部分。不作这个巩固与提高是不对的；在这一阶段不为明天准备大发展的条件也是不对的。
    巩固与提高的关键是师资和教材问题的适当解决。现在师资的问题是数量不足，质量不足。由此提出了改进北京师范大学和各地区大学中的师范学院或教育学院的任务，提出了改进各地师范教育的任务，提出了加强教员轮训和在职学习的任务，借以培养众多的称职的师资。
    为了解决教材问题，这次会议决定了加强教科书编审工作的具体计划，我们一定要努力促其实现。
    为了培养大批中级建设干部，中等学校在今后若干年内应该着重地向中等技术学校发展。
    新区教育工作的关键，是争取团结改造知识分子。此外，必须维持原有学校，逐步改善。
    四、争取团结和改造知识分子是新区教育工作的关键。毛主席告诉我们“对于旧文化工作者，旧教育工作者及旧医生们的态度，是采取适当方法，教育他们，使他们获得新观点、新方法、为中国人民服务”。任弼时同志在《土地改革中的几个问题》的演说中说，对于一般知识分子，“民主政权应采取保护他们的政策，并且应当尽量争取他们为人民共和国服务。”“只要他们表示愿意服从民主政府法令，特别是土地法，不反对共产党的政策，愿为人民服务，不进行破坏活动，如有违法行为，甘受政府法律制裁。我们就可以让他们出来工作。可办各种训练班，训练技术和政治，慢慢改造他们，然后分配他们以适当工作。”我们必须坚决地正确地执行这个团结和改造知识分子的政策。我们应该防止减租和土地改革中对知识分子的曾经发生过的左的偏向，即排斥一切知识分子，停办大批学校。中国的知识分子大多数与土地有联系，他们在土地改革的斗争中是动摇的，但是他们的立场是可以经过教育而改变的，我们必须事先向他们进行土地改革的教育，争取他们积极参加或支持土地改革的工作。
    我们在新区应坚决执行维持原有学校，逐步作可能与必要的改善的方针。所谓维持就是每到一处，不许破坏损毁这些学校的设备房屋，让一般的原有教员安心教下去，然后有计划有步骤地加以改善，决不要采取急进的冒险的政策。
    对于失业的知识分子要设法安置。各地应该设法防止青年学生的大批失学；如有失学现象，应妥善解决。这是新区的一个重要问题，我们应该十分郑重地对待和处理这个问题。
    五、对新区学校安顿以后的主要工作，是有计划、有步骤地在教师和青年学生中进行政治与思想教育，其主要目的乃是逐步地建立革命的人生观。
            新区学校安顿后的主要工作，是进行政治与思想教育。
    这种教育是国民教育的一部分，其基本性质是新民主主义的，还不是社会主义的。这种教育首先要反对买办的、封建的、法西斯主义思想，建立为人民服务的思想。但是为了建立和巩固为人民服务的思想，应当提倡和鼓励马克思列宁主义世界观和毛泽东思想的学习。这种提倡和学习，目的是在保证和贯彻目前历史时期的新民主主义建设，并不是要求立即实现社会主义。毛主席说，“我们既应把对于共产主义的思想体系与社会制度的宣传，与对于新民主主义的行动纲领的实践区别开来，又应把作为观察问题研究学问处理工作的共产主义的方法，与作为国民文化的新民主主义的方针区别开来。把二者混为一谈，无疑是很不妥当的。”
    根据各地经验，为了有效地进行政治思想教育，第一、理论学习必需密切结合学生的思想实际，即把理论学习作为改造思想的武器，改造思想作为理论学习的直接目的。第二、必须抓住重点。解决主要的思想问题。课程以少而精为原则，思想改造的基本点，在确立革命的人生观。第三、发扬自由思考，善于民主启发，正确运用批评与自我批评。第四、对不同的具体对象，发扬其本身思想中的正确或比较正确的成分，通过其自己的力量，里应外合地和逐步提高地克服其不正确思想，巩固与提高其比较正确的思想。第五、这种学习应当与自己参加劳动生产，参加群众斗争，参观解放军或工厂等活动结合起来，才能收到大的成效。
    积累经验，逐步改革旧教育制度。
    六、共同纲领规定，“人民政府应有计划有步骤地改革旧的教育制度、教育内容和教学法。”这是一个艰巨的任务。改造旧教育和建设新教育是两个密切联系和不可分开的过程。前者要在后者的指导下进行；而新教育的建设也必须从旧教育吸取合理的成分。
    旧的学制的改革是一个比较长期的过程，必须经过各级教育的不断改革，积累比较成熟的经验之后，才能有比较全般的改革。我们不能性急。大学中学的课程必须继续改革。改革的重点是加强革命的政治学习，合理地精简现有课程。关键是打通教员思想。教学方法的改革，重点在于反对书本与实际分离的教条主义，同时防止轻视基本理论学习的狭隘实用主义。必须坚决走向理论与实际一致。必须改善考试制度。学校的管理必须正确实行民主集中制。
    对中国人办的私立学校，一般采保护维持加强领导，逐步改造的方针。
    七、在目前条件下，我们对中国人办的私立学校除极坏者应予取缔或接管外，一般地应采保护维持，加强领导，逐步改造的方针。没有必要而随便命令停办或接管，是不妥当的。我们对成绩优良的私立学校应予以奖励或补助；对纯粹为谋利而设的私立学校，要予以整顿和改造，使之逐渐地能够实行新民主主义教育，实行民主管理与经济公开；对经费困难而办理成绩不坏的私立学校应给以补助。
    八、目前国家财政还很困难，但是我们是有办法、有希望的。各级教育工作者的生活是艰苦的，我们在可能条件下，应设法改善他们的物质和政治待遇。对女教师应照顾其特殊困难。但我们教育工作者本身，在这伟大的时代，应该发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，具备全局观点和历史观点，充分认识自己任务的重大，百倍提高自己的积极性和创造性，培养和巩固从事教育工作的事业精神，克服一切困难，完成自己的光荣的历史使命。
