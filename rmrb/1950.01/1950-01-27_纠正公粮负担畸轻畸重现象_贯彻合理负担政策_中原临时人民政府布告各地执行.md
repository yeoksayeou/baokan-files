Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, January 25th: The autumn grain levy in the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi has been basically and victoriously completed. The Central Plains Provisional People's Government is now beginning to correct the phenomena of excessively light and heavy burdens of the autumn public grain and implement the policy of rational burden. At present, the public grain in Henan and Hubei provinces under the jurisdiction of the Central Plains Provisional People's Government has been basically put into warehouses, and the grain levy work in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces has also entered the warehousing stage. The newly liberated areas of Guangdong and Guangxi have also begun warehousing. However, due to the fact that the reactionary remnants of the Kuomintang have not been completely eliminated, the lower-level government has not been transformed, and the peasants in the new district have not been universally mobilized, landlords and rich peasants can take the opportunity to collude with the old Baojia personnel to conceal the land and output, shifting the burden to the peasants, making the peasants' burden too heavy; in some places, because they failed to fully develop democracy, conduct investigations and research, and take into account the affordability of all classes, a few landlords also burdened heavier; in addition, some cadres have a simple task-oriented viewpoint, adopting methods of dividing classes and drawing burdens, and committing anarchic and undisciplined behaviors of arbitrarily increasing additional grain, which also aggravated the phenomenon of excessively light and heavy burdens on autumn public grain. In order to implement the policy of rational burden, the Central Plains Provisional People's Government issued a proclamation on the 17th of this month, stipulating that any illegal behavior of landlords and rich peasants concealing land, intending to evade or reduce the burden, if exposed by the masses and verified by the government, and there is conclusive evidence, in addition to compensating the burden according to their actual land, they may be given appropriate punishments; the compensated part shall be used to compensate the peasants who bear an excessive burden after a part is handed over to the public. As for the landlords who have implemented the "25% rent reduction," the proclamation stipulates that the public grain they should pay shall be jointly borne by the owners and tenants; the amount borne by both parties shall be determined by the local conditions. If the landlord has not implemented rent reduction, the public grain shall be entirely borne by the landlord, but if the peasants demand the landlord to return the rent according to the law after the landlord pays the public grain, a smaller portion should be returned to compensate the landlord's public grain burden. The proclamation also stipulates that the landlord's burden should generally not exceed 50% of his rental income; if it exceeds this standard, it should be regarded as advance payment for this year's summer or autumn public grain for adjustment; if it exceeds too much (such as exceeding 100% or more), and makes life unsustainable, a part should be returned as appropriate to take care of them. As for those whose family composition is wrongly determined, the proclamation points out that it should be corrected immediately and their burden adjusted. The proclamation stipulates that, except for additions approved by the provincial government, all levels of government are not allowed to arbitrarily impose additions, and violators will be severely punished according to law; any excessive additions in various places should be announced and cancelled immediately. The proclamation emphasizes that public grain must be paid on time, and those who refuse to pay will be dealt with according to law. If they feel that the burden is too heavy and difficult to pay, they can appeal to the local government or its higher-level government with factual information and request adjustments. In addition, the proclamation strictly prohibits all behaviors of random deduction, random assignment, and random beatings, and violators will be dealt with according to law.

    The Changjiang Daily here pointed out in a commentary on this proclamation: The Central Plains Provisional People's Government's proclamation on implementing the policy of rational burden in the autumn levy is very correct and timely. The editorial hopes that local governments and all cadres, in accordance with the spirit and methods of this instruction, and in combination with the work of grain warehousing or clearing up arrears, will carefully check the burden situation in various places. The editorial said: All localities must complete the collection task on time, but serious attention must be paid to the phenomena of excessively light and heavy burdens that have already occurred, dispatch capable cadres to deeply mobilize the masses, conduct investigations and research, and convene people's representatives conferences at all levels to seriously discuss and take various appropriate measures to compensate and adjust.

    纠正公粮负担畸轻畸重现象
    贯彻合理负担政策
    中原临时人民政府布告各地执行
    【新华社汉口二十五日电】豫、鄂、湘、赣四省秋季征粮基本上已胜利完成。中原临时人民政府正开始纠正秋季公粮负担上的畸轻畸重现象，贯彻合理负担的政策。目前中原临时人民政府所辖的河南、湖北两省公粮已基本上入仓，湖南、江西两省的征粮工作也已进入入仓阶段，新解放的两广地区也开始入仓。但由于国民党反动残余势力尚未完全肃清，下层政权尚未改造，新区农民未普遍发动，地主富农得以乘机勾结旧保甲人员隐瞒地亩产量，将负担转嫁到农民身上，使农民负担过重；有些地方则由于未能充分发扬民主，进行调查研究，照顾各阶层负担能力，也有少数地主负担较重；加上某些干部存在着单纯的任务观点，采用划阶级、抽负担办法，发生随意增派附加粮的无政府无纪律的行为，也加重了秋季公粮负担上的畸轻畸重现象。中原临时人民政府为了贯彻合理负担政策，特于本月十七日发出布告，规定凡地主富农隐瞒土地，意图逃避或减轻负担的违法行为，经群众揭发，政府查明，确有事实可据者，除按其实有土地补征负担外，得酌情予以处分；此项补征部分除以一部交公外，其余即以弥补负担过重之农民。至于已实行二五减租之地主，布告规定其应交公粮由业佃双方共同负担；双方负担多少由各地酌情规定。地主未实行减租者，公粮完全由地主负担，但地主交公粮后农民依法要求地主退租者，应少退一部，以弥补地主的公粮负担。布告并规定，地主负担一般不应超过其地租收入的百分之五十；如有超过此标准者，应作为预交今年夏季或秋季公粮，以资调剂；其有超出过多（如已超出百分之一百以上），致生活无法维持者，应酌情退还一部，以资照顾。至于家庭成份被订错者，布告指出应即行改正，并调整其负担。布告规定：除经省政府批准之附加外，各级政府一律不准乱派附加，违者依法严惩；各地超额附加应立即公布取消。布告强调必须按期缴纳公粮，抗不缴纳者决依法处理，如感负担过重，完纳困难者，可向当地政府或其上一级政府据实申诉，要求调整。此外，布告并严禁一切乱扣、乱派、乱打等行为，违者依法处理。
    此间长江日报于评论这布告时指出：中原临时人民政府这个关于贯彻秋征中合理负担政策的布告，是十分正确而且适合时宜的。社论希望各地政府和全体干部，根据这个指示的精神和办法，结合征粮入仓或肃清尾欠的工作，认真检查各地负担情形。社论说：各地必须按期完成征收任务，但对于已经发生的畸轻畸重现象，必须严重注意，派遣得力干部深入发动群众，进行调查研究，并召开各界人民代表会认真讨论，采取各种合宜的办法，加以弥补和调整。
