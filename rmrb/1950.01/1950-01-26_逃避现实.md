    Escaping Reality

    "Does the popularity of detective assassination mystery novels indicate a moral decline?" The American *Daily Compass* published this question. One answer came from Lawrence G. Blochman, a prolific detective novelist and expert in creating stories of assassination, robbery, and riots.

    He boasted: "The United States publishes an average of five new mystery novels every week. American readers greedily devour two hundred and fifty new detective novels every year...not counting the republication of the same number of old works."

    This number illustrates that two-fifths of all novels published in the gold-dollar country are about crime and the criminal world. Blochman, an admirer of this kind of literature, does not consider it harmful. On the contrary, he says it is even beneficial to morality because "evil is always punished, and justice and righteousness ultimately triumph."

    We do not need to argue with these American detective novel propagandists. Let's turn to the crime records. Here are a few news items from American newspapers that can illustrate the life influenced by the assassination novels lauded by Blochman.

    The *Chicago Sun-Times* reported that thirteen-year-old Glenny Brand of Wakefield, Massachusetts, was tied to a tree by other children and almost burned to death. His legs were also cut.

    A news item in the *New York Daily News* described how in Huntington, West Virginia, fourteen-year-old James Emmington shot his mother while she was asleep and ran away from home with her purse containing twelve dollars.

    Eleven-year-old John Schaller of Port Huron, Michigan, stabbed four-year-old Michael Barton twenty-six times, saying, "God told me you must die today!" Obviously, this sentence was learned from some hero in a detective novel, possibly from one written by Blochman.

    In the conclusion of the discussion, the *Daily Compass* published: Readers are attracted to detective novels because they want to escape reality. If the readers of Blochman's novels are so eager to escape reality and go into the hair-raising world of crime, then American reality must be very fascinating!

    逃避现实
    “侦探暗杀神秘小说的流行是否表示道德的败下？”美国《每日指南报》登出了这样一个问题。有一个答案是广销侦探小说作家，编制暗杀、抢劫、暴乱故事的专家劳伦斯Ｇ·勃洛门所作的。
    他矜夸说：“美国每星期平均发行五种新的神秘小说，美国的读者们每年贪婪地需要二百五十部新侦探小说全篇……同量的旧作品再版不计在内。”
    这个数字说明金元国家所出版小说总数的五分之二是关于写犯罪和这犯罪世界的。勃洛门是一个这类文学的爱慕者，他不认为这是有害的。相反地，他说这甚至是有益于道德的，因为“罪恶总是受罚，而公理和正义最后总是胜利的。”
    我们不必和这些美国侦探小说宣传家争辩。且转头看一下犯罪纪录。这里几条美国报纸上的新闻可以表示出勃洛门所颂扬的暗杀小说影响下的生活。
    《支加哥太阳时报》报导麻省韦克斐的十三岁孩子格仑尼勃兰，被别的孩子们绑在树上，用火几乎烧死。他的双腿都被割掉。
    《纽约新闻》上的一条新闻叙述在西浮琴尼亚州亨汀顿，十四岁孩子詹姆斯爱敏东在母亲睡着时枪击了她，拿了她藏有十二元美金的钱袋从家里出走。
    密奇根州胡仑港的十一岁孩子约翰雪勒，把四岁的孩子密盖尔巴盾刀伤二十六处，他说：“上帝告诉我，你今天要死！”显然，这句话是从侦探小说某些英雄学来的，可能就是从勃洛门所著的一本里。
    《每日指南报》在讨论的总结里发表：读者之所以为侦探小说所吸引，是因为要逃避现实。假如勃洛门小说的读者是这样迫切地逃避现实而到令人毛发森然的犯罪世界中去，美国的现实一定是很迷人的吧！
