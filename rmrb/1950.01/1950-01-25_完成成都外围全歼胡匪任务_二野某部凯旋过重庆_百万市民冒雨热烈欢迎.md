Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 24th. A unit of the People's Liberation Army's Second Field Army, after victoriously completing the task of annihilating Hu Zongnan's bandit troops in the outskirts of Chengdu, has returned from the Chengdu front to designated areas to undertake local construction tasks. On the 22nd, when the unit triumphantly passed through Chongqing, it received a warm welcome from one million citizens. To the sound of military music, the soldiers marched forward with vigorous steps. Wearing helmets and full of spirit, their neat American equipment and the dozens of banners presented by the people along the way during the advance into the Southwest, as well as award banners such as "First Class Merit in Crossing the Yangtze," marked the victory and glory of the troops. Citizens braved the rain and crowded the streets, offering flowers, flags, and letters of condolence. The preparatory committee of the Municipal Women's Federation and other organizations even stuffed cigarettes, notebooks, towels, soap, etc., into the backpacks of the soldiers who resolutely declined. Employees of the Telecommunications Bureau hung colorful paper flowers all over the commanders and fighters. When the column arrived in front of the flag-offering platform at the former "Monument to Victory," more than seventy large and small banners, as well as flower baskets and glory lamps, were enthusiastically presented by over sixty units, including the 21st Arsenal, Yuhua Textile Mill, the Student Federation, and the business community. The pockets and weapons of the commanders and fighters were covered with flowers of various colors. The crowd, a sea of people, constantly cheered and applauded. When the workers of the 21st Arsenal discovered heavy machine guns they had manufactured among the weapons, they excitedly shouted, "The weapons we made have also returned!"

Determined to Liberate Tibet and Answer the People's Expectations

The triumphant commanders and fighters were extremely moved. The Political Department of the Second Field Army and the triumphant troops specifically wrote letters to thank the people for their welcome, expressing their determination to carry the revolution through to the end, resolutely carry out the glorious task of liberating Tibet and supporting fraternal troops in liberating Taiwan and Hainan Island, accelerate the suppression of remaining bandits, support the government and cherish the people, and actively participate in the construction of the Southwest, to answer the expectations of the people.
