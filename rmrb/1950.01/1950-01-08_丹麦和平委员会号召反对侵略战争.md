Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th -- TASS, Copenhagen, 6th: The Danish Peace Committee has issued an appeal to all peace-loving people of Denmark, calling for the development of a peace movement and the establishment of peace committees in all cities and villages, in trade unions and democratic organizations. The appeal declares: "Denmark's participation in America's preparations for wars of aggression has further increased military spending, which already consumes one million kroner (Danish currency) every day. Denmark's independence has been completely forfeited, and the Danish people have been sold out as mercenaries. The Danish people must tell the government plainly that we are against war, against the arms race, and against new war taxes." The appeal is signed by prominent writers Martin Andersen Nexø and Hans Kirk, among others.
