Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 20th: According to a TASS report from Berlin: The Provisional People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held its eighth plenary session in Berlin on the 18th and unanimously passed a declaration responding to the World Peace Congress Standing Committee's telegram requesting parliaments of all countries to strengthen the peace movement. The declaration stated: The Provisional People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic was deeply moved upon learning of the telegram from the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. We believe that the suggestions in the telegram reflect the united will of all nations. However, no one fears the launching of a new war more than the German people, as it would endanger the survival of our country and nation. The German people sincerely hope that this telegram will succeed.

The declaration also stated, let the German people recognize the power of their full unity in the struggle for peace; this struggle is the guarantee of peace in Europe because we are engaged in this struggle standing on the side of the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and all peace-loving countries in the world. The Provisional People's Chamber believes that this unity and joint action is the foundation for guaranteeing peace, and therefore calls on all peace-loving forces in Germany to support this proposal aimed at defending peace.

    【新华社北京二十日电】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国临时人民议会于十八日在柏林举行第八次全体会议，一致通过一项宣言，响应世界和平大会常设委员会要求各国议会加强和平运动的通电。宣言称：德意志民主共和国临时人民议会获悉世界和平大会常设委员会的通电后深为感动。我们认为通电中的建议反映各民族联合的意志。但是，没有人比德国人民更害怕发动新战争，因为这会危及我们国家和民族的生存。德国人民衷诚地希望这一通电成功。
    宣言又称，让德国人民认清他们充分团结一致为和平而斗争的力量，这一斗争就是欧洲和平的保证，因为我们是站在苏联、人民民主国家及全世界爱好和平的国家方面从事这一斗争的。临时人民议会认为这种团结与联合行动是保障和平的基础，因此号召全德国爱好和平的力量支持这一旨在维护和平的建议。
