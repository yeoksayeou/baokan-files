Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 7th. When the People's Liberation Army entered Chengdu on December 30th, they were met with a fervent welcome from the citizens. That morning, the streets were adorned with vibrant five-star national flags, and colorful slogans were posted everywhere. Many exquisite arches were erected on the main streets, emblazoned with large characters reading "Welcome the People's Liberation Army" and "Celebrate Liberation." At six o'clock in the morning, welcoming crowds surged towards Simadian Bridge at the North Gate, with over a thousand vehicles of various types and approximately sixty thousand welcomers clogging the streets. Generals Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, and Pan Wenhua, who revolted in Ya'an, also came to welcome the PLA.

At ten o'clock, the People's Liberation Army, led by Generals He Long and Wang Weizhou, solemnly marched into the city. Preceded by giant color portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, followed by the solemn five-star national flag and military flags, came the powerful ranks of cavalry riding steeds, infantry, artillery, engineers, stretcher bearers, and heavy artillery vehicles. The rooftops, trees, vehicle tops, and all high places along the route were packed with people. Cheers, applause, and the constant sound of firecrackers merged into one. Many welcomers were moved to tears upon seeing their liberators arrive. The vehicles and artillery of the Liberation Army were covered with slogans pasted on by the welcoming masses. Children stuck small flags on the heads of mules and horses, and many people ran out of the welcoming ranks to exchange their small flags with the Liberation Army soldiers on the vehicles. Students danced the Yangko with abandon, and businessmen stopped their business to join the welcoming celebrations. Many people also brought oranges and tangerines to give to the Liberation Army soldiers. Songs of liberation echoed back and forth between the ranks of soldiers and the welcoming masses. One welcomer said, "What day has ever been as lively as today!" When General He Long passed by, he received enthusiastic cheers from the masses, and he smiled and saluted the welcoming crowds. The procession entered the city from Simadian Bridge, passed through Boji Street, Chengmendong, North Avenue, Yudai Bridge, Chunxi Road, East Avenue, and finally reached Shaocheng Park, lasting four hours.
