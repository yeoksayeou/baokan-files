    Beijing Finance Bureau Official Explains Issues Related to Paying Real Estate Tax
    [Beijing News] Since the commencement of real estate tax collection in Beijing on the 18th of this month, taxpayers have been going to tax collection points to pay. However, some taxpayers are still unclear about certain aspects of the real estate tax collection. Therefore, an official from the Municipal Finance Bureau has provided the following further brief explanation:

    I. The Beijing real estate tax is collected annually, and this collection is for the year 1949. The payment period is ten days (a fine will be imposed after a ten-day delay), calculated from the date the payment notice is delivered, with the postmark serving as proof of the delivery date.

    II. The real estate tax payment notice is based on the name and address reported by the property owner during property rights registration at the Land Administration Bureau. The acreage of land listed on the notice is calculated by combining all the property owned by the owner throughout the city, and is not just the acreage of the property where the owner resides. An owner receives only one notice, unlike property tax where there is one notice for each house. Owners should pay special attention when receiving the notice: it is correct if the acreage listed on the notice matches the total acreage of all the property they own in the city.

    III. The real estate tax collection method is progressive with excess. All real estate in the city is currently divided into twenty levels according to the region. The tax rates vary. For example, the tax rate for first-level land is 503 jin of millet per mu, while for twentieth-level land it is only 15 jin. The progressive starting point is 165 jin (equivalent to the tax payable for one mu of ninth-level land). This means that if the sum of the taxes payable on all levels of real estate owned by the owner throughout the city exceeds 165 jin, the excess will be subject to an additional tax. For specific calculation methods, please refer to the Beijing Municipal People's Government Announcement Bu Cheng Zi No. 18, "Provisional Measures for the Collection of Real Estate Tax in Beijing," published in the People's Daily on December 7th last year.

    IV. For property owners who sold their property before August 15th last year, the real estate tax for 1949 shall be borne by the new owner; for those who sold after August 15th, it shall be borne by the old owner (unless otherwise agreed by both parties). This has already been clearly stipulated in the Municipal Finance Bureau Announcement Cai Xing Zi No. 176, issued on November 22nd last year. The announcement stipulates: All those who previously or recently attempted to evade progressive tax, or had other intentions, and divided one household into several households using aliases or "separation," "gifting," or even fake sales, regardless of whether they have received ownership certificates and tax deeds, are urged to declare it promptly and pay the real estate tax as one household. Otherwise, once discovered, in addition to the retroactive collection of the progressive tax, they will be punished according to law.

    V. Real estate tax is a type of property tax, levied on the owner of the land. If there is a right of superficies, the superficies holder shall pay it, and shall not refuse or delay payment on any pretext. If the owner was originally registered as one household, but has now separated the family or sold a portion of the property, but has not yet completed the transfer and separation procedures at the Land Administration Bureau, the tax will still be levied as one household; if private property has become public property due to confiscation or expropriation, a certificate can be obtained from the Custody Bureau and returned to the Finance Bureau along with the notice; if the property right is in dispute and has not been resolved, the original owner should still pay, and if the owner changes after the property right is determined, the new owner should return the money to the person who paid the tax this time; if private property is occupied by government agencies or military units, reasonable rent should be collected, and the real estate tax should still be paid by the owner; as for the issue of owners having a right of lease, it will be handled temporarily according to past practices or contractual provisions.

    京财政局负责人解释有关缴纳地产税问题
    【北京讯】京市地产税自本月十八日开征以来，纳税义务人已纷往税款代收处缴款；但有一些纳税者对征收地产税中的一些问题，仍没有清楚明了，为此，市财政局负责人特再简要说明如下：
    一、京市地产税每年征收一次，此次征收是一九四九年度的。缴款期限十天（逾期十日后罚款），以缴款通知书送达之日起计算，送达之日期，以邮戳为凭。
    二、地产税缴款通知书系根据业主在地政局申报产权登记时所报姓名住址。通知书上所列地产亩数，系按业主散在全市所有地产，全部合并起来计算，并不只是业主自己住所一处的地产亩数。一个业主只有一份通知，不像房产税那样一所房子一份通知。业主于收到通知书时应特别注意：如通知书上所列亩数与自己在本市所有地产的总亩数符合，那便对了。
    三、地产税征收办法是超额累进的。全市地产现按地区分为二十级。税额不同。如第一级地每亩税额为五百零三斤小米，二十级地则仅为十五斤。累进起征点为一百六十五斤（相当于九级地一亩应纳税额），那便是说，将业主在全市所有的各级地产所应课的税额加起来，如应纳税额超过一百六十五斤，则超过的部分，予以加征。其具体计算方法，可参阅去年十二月七日人民日报北京市人民政府布城字第十八号布告《北京市地产税征收暂行办法》。
    四、业主在去年八月十五日以前将地产卖出者，一九四九年度地产税由新业主负担；在八月十五日以后卖出者，则由旧业主负担（双方另有协议者，从其约定）。在去年十一月二十二日市财政局财行字第一七六号布告内，已早有明文规定。该布告规定：凡以前或最近企图逃避累进税，或有其它意图而将一户以化名或“分割”、“赠与”甚至为假买卖的形式而分为数户者，不论已否领有所有权状及税契，统希赶紧申报，按一户缴纳地产税。否则一经查出，除追征累进税外，将依法处罚。
    五、地产税为财产税的一种，系向土地所有人课征。其设有典权者，由承典人缴纳，不得借故不缴或拖延。如业主原登记时是一户，现已分家或卖出了一部分，但尚未在地政局办理过户分割手续，仍照一户征税；如私产已因查封或没收变为公产者可向清管局取得证明，连同通知书退回财政局；如因产权涉讼，尚未解决者，仍应由原业主缴纳，等产权确定后，如业主易人，则新业主应将款归还此次缴税人；私产为机关部队住用者，应索取合理租金，地产税仍由业主缴纳；至于业主有铺底权问题者，暂依过去习惯或契约规定办理。
