    Imports Serve Production and Construction
    North China's Import Business Develops
    State-Owned Companies' Imports of Production Materials Exceeded One-Third of Total Imports Last Year
    [Tianjin News] The North China Import Company has gradually achieved initial development for state-owned import business in its business operations in 1949. This company was established last September on the basis of the import department of the former North China Foreign Trade Company. According to preliminary statistics, since the start of foreign trade in March of last year until the end of the year, it accounted for 31% of the total value of imports approved in the entire North China region; the company's imports accounted for 44% of the total value of goods imported by Tianjin Customs last year. The fact that state-owned import trade accounts for more than one-third of the total import value is an unprecedented change in Chinese history. Among the goods imported by the company, the majority were industrial finished products such as production materials and tools. In the process of selling goods, the company adhered to the principle of supporting production, and directly or indirectly sent most of the production materials and equipment to factories and construction institutions. Forty-eight percent of last year's total imports were allocated for inter-industry adjustment, 37% for state-owned enterprises, 11% for government agencies and military units, and 3.5% for market sales and private enterprises. In the inter-industry adjustment, in addition to allocating a portion of goods to foreign and domestic trade companies, most of them were resold to public and private enterprises in Tianjin through trust companies. In fact, the supply of raw materials and equipment to public enterprises and factories has reached more than half of the company's total sales. Since the establishment of the company, because state-owned import business has accounted for one-third of the total import value, it has gradually been able to play a certain role in controlling the prices of imported goods, enabling the national economy to gradually lead the private economy forward. At the same time, under the correct price policy, private importers must also engage in imports that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood in order to be profitable. Meanwhile, in handling direct imports, since September, it has partially changed the past phenomenon of conducting foreign trade entirely through merchants, and gradually established direct contact with some foreign manufacturers, avoiding many intermediate exploitations, thereby reducing domestic production costs.
    With the recovery and development of the national economy, the import company's tasks in 1950 will inevitably increase. How to strengthen the business and political study of cadres to facilitate business progress is an urgent need. Secondly, it is necessary to unite and lead merchants to work in unison with state-owned companies, implement the spirit of "imports serving production and construction," and expand the scope of direct ordering, all of which are what the import company should strive to complete this year.

    进口为生产建设服务
    华北进口业务获发展
    去年国营公司进口生产原料逾进口总值三分之一
    【天津讯】华北进口公司，在一九四九年的业务经营中，已逐渐为国营进口业务谋得了初步发展。该公司系去年九月在前华北对外贸易公司进口部的基础上成立，据初步统计，自去年三月开始对外贸易以来，至年底为止，即占全华北区所批准进口的总值百分之三十一；该公司进口货物即占上年由天津海关进口商品总值的百分之四十四。国营进口贸易占进口总值的三分之一以上，这是在中国历史上一个空前的变化。在该公司进口货物中，大部分为生产原料、工具等工业成品。在销货过程中，该公司本着扶植生产的原则，将大部分生产原料、器材，直接或间接送到工厂和建设机构中去。上年进货总额的百分之四十八即分配为联业调剂，百分之三十七为国营企业，百分之十一为机关部队，市场销售和私人企业是百分之三·五。在联业调剂中，除了调拨一部分商品给对外、对内各贸易公司外，大部分是经过信托公司再转售给津市公私营企业的，实际对公营企业工厂的原料和器材的供给，已达该公司总销货额的一半以上。自该公司设立后，由于国营进口业务已占进口总值的三分之一，故已能逐步的在掌握进口货物价格中起一定的作用。使国家经济能逐步领导私营经济向前迈进。同时在正确的价格政策下，私人进口商也必须做有益于国计民生的进口，才会有利可图。同时，在办理直接进口上，自九月份后，已部分的改变了过去完全通过商人进行国外贸易的现象，逐步地和一些外国厂商建立了直接的联系，而避免了许多中间剥削，借以减轻国内生产的成本。
    随着全国经济的恢复与发展，一九五○年进口公司的任务必然加重，如何加强干部的业务和政治学习，以利业务的进展，实为迫切需要。其次应团结领导商人与国营公司步调一致，贯彻“进口为生产建设服务”的精神，以及扩大直接订货范围，均是今年进口公司所应努力完成的。
