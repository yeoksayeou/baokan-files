    On Improving Administrative Work Methods in Government Offices, Starting with Adjusting Telephone Usage
    Gao Xin

    Since the establishment of the Government Administration Council's Political and Legal Committee last October, all staff members have undergone two months of anti-empiricism study, strengthened work inspections, and implemented a staff appraisal system. Many comrades have deeply understood the damage that following established routines without thinking can inflict on work. They have earnestly engaged in self-examination, transforming their ideological and work styles, thereby achieving considerable improvements in various aspects of the office's work.

    This article, written by Comrade Gao Xin of the Administrative Office, is a summary of their work. Phenomena such as "becoming oblivious to ordinary matters encountered daily," as pointed out in the article, are common manifestations of following established routines and bureaucratic work styles in administrative work. Not rejecting small tasks is one of Lenin's important legacies. In the future, we should tirelessly start with small matters, delve into our work, regularly conduct work inspections, strengthen coordination and cooperation in our work, and continuously improve our work systems and methods based on new circumstances. These are all important methods for improving administrative work in government offices.

                                      ——General Office of the Political and Legal Committee

    When the Government Administration Council's Political and Legal Committee was preparing to be established last October, it installed two telephone exchanges, ten trunk lines, seventy-five extensions, and eleven direct lines, averaging one phone for every four or so rooms. The monthly telephone bill amounted to 2,722 jin of millet. An inspection was conducted in November, but due to a lack of initiative, failure to use our brains, and following old routines, appropriate adjustments were not made based on the new circumstances. Only twenty-five extensions were removed. It was not until the anti-empiricism study was launched in late December and the appraisal system was established that a thorough inspection was conducted. Based on the principles of streamlining, economizing, and meeting actual needs, another five direct lines, fifteen extensions, and five trunk lines were removed. With the reduction in extensions, one 30-line exchange was also removed. The two removals saved a total of 1,332 jin of millet, approximately half of the original expenditure. In addition, two telephone operators were freed up for other work. From this example, we have learned the following lessons:

            In-depth inspection plays a decisive role in improving work.

    During the inspection and removal process, it was discovered that many phones were either not used at all or rarely used (such as in the auditorium, conference rooms, and reception rooms). The five leading comrades' phones were also not frequently used and could have been removed, but opinions to remove them were not put forward based on the actual situation. In some units, the organizational structure had changed, and the need for phones had decreased, but old practices were not broken. Other units unilaterally emphasized their needs and did not agree to removals. This, on the one hand, illustrates that empiricism and departmentalism still exist in government offices, preventing a keen observation of new situations and an objective resolution of unreasonable phenomena. On the other hand, it also proves that in-depth inspection is decisive for improving work.

            Improving work should start with everyday, ordinary matters.

    Telephones are frequently used tools, with monthly expenses exceeding two million yuan. Unreasonable phenomena have persisted for two months, but because we are oblivious to the ordinary matters we encounter daily, we either wait for instructions or guidance from above, or we idealize the creation of experience and the improvement of work, often attempting to find solutions in illusions, resulting in aimless thinking. We fail to pay attention to the problems at hand, leading to waste. This teaches us that in our work, we must be pragmatic and observe and discover problems from the everyday, ordinary, and specific matters.

            Familiarity with the work, diligent study, and improvement are necessary to increase efficiency.

    In November, twenty-five extensions were removed, but the telephone office did not return the removed phones to the telecommunications bureau. Only a verbal notification was made once, and the relevant department did not conduct a thorough inspection. Because the telecommunications bureau did not receive formal notification, it did not collect the phones, and as a result, charges were still applied for December. This time, one exchange was removed, and the work of two people was done by one. Telephone lines were concentrated on one exchange. This requires the telephone operators to improve their skills. Also, because there are phones to be installed, timely repairs are also required. These changes prompt us to seek out regularities, improve methods, and increase work efficiency.

            We cannot improve the work of our own unit in isolation; we must connect and cooperate with relevant units.

    In the past, the accounting section was simply a revenue and expenditure agency. After the General Affairs Section approved telephone expenses, the accounting section simply paid them. The telephone office neither inquired nor handled the expenses, creating a disconnect and a blind spot. The accounting section has a wider range of contact and more opportunities to discover problems in the matters it handles. Therefore, it should be responsible for carefully reviewing the expenses it handles and proposing problems and solutions to seek improvement. Otherwise, it will affect the control of the budget and lead to waste. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the connection and organic cooperation between relevant units.

    从调整电话机使用，谈机关行政工作方法的改进
    高信
    政务院政治法律委员会成立后，所有机关工作人员经过去冬两个月反对经验主义学习、加强工作检查，并实行工作人员考核制度以来，许多同志深深领悟因袭成规不用思想所给予工作的损害，认真自我检查，改造思想作风和工作作风，从而使机关各方面工作获得不少的改进。
    行政处高信同志所写的这篇文章，即是他们工作的一个总结。如象其中指出的“对于日常接触的平凡事物熟视无睹”现象，也就是机关行政工作中因袭成规和官僚主义作风的习常的表现。不拒绝细小工作，是列宁重要遗训之一，我们今后应不厌烦地从小事做起，钻研业务，经常地进行检查工作，加强工作中的联系配合，不断地根据新的情况改进工作制度和方法，这都是改进机关行政工作的重要方法。
                                      ——政法委员会办公厅
    政务院政治法律委员会在去年十月筹备成立时，共按装电话交换台两座、中继线十条、分机七十五部、直通机十一部，平均四间多房即有一个机子，每月需支付电话费小米二七二二斤。十一月间，曾检查了一次，但由于工作缺乏主动性、不用脑筋、沿袭了老一套，未能根据新情况作适当的调整，仅拆减了分机二十五部。直到十二月下旬展开了反经验主义的学习并建立了考绩制度后，才进行深入检查，根据精简节约与实际需要的原则，又拆撤直通机五部、分机十五部、中继线五条，随着分机减少，又拆除三十门交换台一座，两次拆减共节省小米一三三二斤，约达原支出的二分之一。此外还可余下两个电话员，转做其他工作。从此一事例中，获得以下教育：
            深入检查对改建工作起有决定意义
    在检查与拆减遇程中，发现有许多机子根本没有用，或者不常用，（如大礼堂、会议室、会客室）。五位首长的电话也不常用，本可省去，但未根据实际情况，提意见拆除；有的单位组织机构变更了，电话需用减少，也未能打破旧例；有的单位则片面强调需要，不同意拆减。这一方面说明在机关中仍存在着经验主义与本位主义作风，不能敏锐地看到新情况并客观地去解决不合理现象。另方面也证明深入检查对改进工作有决定意义。
            改进工作，应从日常平凡的事情上做起。
    电话是经常使用的工具，每月开支二百余万元。不合理的现象已持续二月之久，但由于对日常接触的平凡事物熟视无睹，不是等待上级的吩咐或指引，便是把创造经验改进工作理想化了，往往脱离实际地企图从虚幻中去找办法，于是就不着边际地瞎想，而恰在这些手头的问题上未加注意，以致形成浪费。这教育我们在工作中必须实事求是地从日常平凡的具体事物中去观察与发现问题。
            熟习业务，钻研改进，才能提高效率。
    在十一月间曾拆减了分机二十五部，但电话室并未将拆下的机子交回电信局，仅做了一次口头通知，主管部门也未深入检查。由于电信局未得正式通知未收机子，结果十二月份还是照章收费。这次交换台拆了一座，二个人的工作一个人做了，电话线集中在一个台上了，这就要求电话员提高技术；又因有装配的机子，也要求能及时修理。这些变动，促使我们找寻规律，改进方法，以提高工作效率。
            不能孤立的改进本单位工作，须与有关单位联系配合。
    会计股过去是单纯的收付机关，电话费经总务科批后，会计股便照发。电话室毫不过问也不经手，形成脱节与盲目的现象。会计股接触面较宽，它有更多的机会在接触的事物中发现问题，因此它应对于经手的开支切实负责审查，并提出问题与解决办法，以求改进。否则就会影响预算的掌握，发生浪费，因此须要加强有关单位间的联系与有机的配合。
