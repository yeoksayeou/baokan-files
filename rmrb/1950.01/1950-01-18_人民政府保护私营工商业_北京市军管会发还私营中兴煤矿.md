    People's Government Protects Private Industry and Commerce
    Beijing Military Control Commission Returns Private Zhongxing Coal Mine
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Military Control Commission returned the Mentougou Zhongxing Coal Mine, which belongs to the private Pingxing Industrial Company and had been under its trusteeship, on the 16th. The return ceremony was held yesterday at the Jingxi Mining Bureau. The main shareholders of Pingxing Industrial Company are Wang Ziwu, Zhu Qingshu, and others. Zhongxing Coal Mine is a mechanized coal mine with complete equipment. When Mentougou was liberated in December of the year before last, the mine manager and responsible persons did not understand the People's Government's policy of protecting national industry and commerce, and all fled the mining area. No one was responsible for the business, order was disrupted, and production was suspended. In order to solve the workers' livelihood and enable production to continue, the Municipal Military Control Commission sent personnel to take over the trusteeship on February 4th of last year. During the trusteeship period, the North China Coal and Iron Company Beijing Branch, the People's Bank of China Beijing Branch, and the Jingxi Coal Mine Company successively provided strong support through coal allocation, order placement, and loans, enabling the mine to restore production. Later, the mine's responsible personnel successively returned to the mine. After investigations by the Military Control Commission and the Municipal People's Government, it was confirmed that the mine was not bureaucratic capital and had not colluded with the Kuomintang reactionary government. Therefore, it was decided to return it to the original owners for operation. At the return ceremony held on the 16th, Cai Ping, director of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, represented the municipal government in supervising the handling of the return procedures. After Director Cai announced the order of the Military Control Commission, he pointed out in his speech that the return of the Zhongxing Coal Mine is a concrete realization of the government's policy of protecting national industry and commerce. During the trusteeship period, the correct policy of restoring and developing production was implemented, enabling the mine to restore production. After the return, the government will continue to adhere to the policy of supporting and developing production for the mine, and hopes that the mine will continue to work hard to produce. Liu Shusen, the trustee committee member, gave a detailed report on the work during the trusteeship period. Zhu Qingshu, the assistant manager of Pingxing Industrial Company, expressed his gratitude for the government's various supports. He said: In the future, under the government's support, he is willing to work hard to produce in order to supply coal. Representatives from the Beijing Coal Mine Trade Union and the Coal and Iron Company also spoke successively. At 5 p.m. that day, a general meeting of all employees was held at the Zhongxing Mine. The trustee committee member announced the revocation of the trusteeship, and the handover began immediately.

    人民政府保护私营工商业
    北京市军管会发还私营中兴煤矿
    【北京讯】北京市军事管制委员会十六日发还代管的私营平兴实业公司所属门头沟中兴煤矿。发还仪式已于昨日在京西矿务处举行。平兴实业公司主要股东为王子文、朱?青等人，中兴煤矿为机采煤矿，设备完善。前年十二月门头沟解放时，该矿经理及负责人不了解人民政府保护民族工商业政策，均逃离矿区，业务无人负责，秩序紊乱，生产停顿。本市军管会为解决工人生活，并使生产得以继续，乃于去年二月四日派员代管。在代管期间，经华北煤铁公司北京分公司、中国人民银行北京分行、京西煤矿公司先后以批煤、定货、贷款等方式大力扶植，使该矿能恢复生产。后来该矿负责人员陆续返矿，经军管会、市人民政府多方调查，该矿确非官僚资本，也未与国民党反动政府勾结，故决定发还原业主经营。十六日举行发还仪式时，由京西矿务处蔡平处长代表市政府监督办理发还手续，蔡处长宣布军管会命令后，在讲话中指出：中兴煤矿发还，是政府保护民族工商业政策的具体实现，代管期间，就执行了恢复发展生产的正确方针，使该矿得以恢复生产；发还之后，政府对该矿仍本扶植和发展生产的方针，希望该矿继续努力生产。代管委员刘树森对代管期间的工作，做了详尽的报告，平兴实业公司协理朱?青讲话，他对政府种种扶植，极表感谢，他说：今后愿在政府扶植下，努力生产，以供应燃煤。北京市煤矿工会、煤铁公司等代表也相继讲了话。当日下午五时并在中兴矿举行全体职工大会，由代管委员宣布撤销代管，即日开始进行点交。
