    Instruction of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government on Handling Agricultural Land Issues in the Suburbs of Old Liberated Areas
    (Passed at the 15th Political Affairs Meeting of the State Administration Council on January 13, 1950)
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch] The full text of the "Instruction of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government on Handling Agricultural Land Issues in the Suburbs of Old Liberated Areas," passed at the 15th Political Affairs Meeting of the State Administration Council on January 13, 1950, is as follows:
    The land reform to eliminate feudal and semi-feudal exploitation systems has been fully completed in the Northeast. It has also been completed in the old liberated areas of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces, and is about to be completed or is being implemented in some small new areas. The conditions for implementing land reform in the urban suburbs, which are under the long-term influence of these rural areas, are also ripe. The suburbs of Beijing and Tianjin have already started implementation. Therefore, it is decided that the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing, Tianjin, and the cities under the jurisdiction of the aforementioned six provinces should be completed before this year's spring plowing or after the autumn harvest. However, since the urban suburbs are closely linked to the city economically and the commodity economy is relatively developed, resolving the land issue in urban and suburban areas must take into account the needs of urban construction and industrial development. Therefore, land reform in the suburbs should have some differences from land reform in rural areas. Based on the experiences of Beijing and Tianjin, the following measures are stipulated for land reform in urban suburbs:
    1.  The land of landlords and the land rented out by old-style rich peasants shall be confiscated or requisitioned. For the needs of urban construction and industrial development, all shall be owned by the state, managed by the municipal people's government, and distributed to landless and land-poor peasants for use. Landlords who are willing to engage in farming to maintain their livelihoods after the land reform should also be allocated the same amount of land as the peasants who receive land. However, landlords who have other income to maintain their livelihoods should be allocated less or no land at all.
    2.  The draft animals, farm implements, and surplus grain of the landlords should be confiscated and distributed to the peasants to solve the difficulties of peasants in production funds. The surplus real estate of landlords in rural areas may be requisitioned. Except for large buildings and villas in scenic areas, which should be retained for public use according to the needs of municipal construction, the confiscated houses should be distributed to the peasants for residence to solve the housing shortage of poor peasants. All land and houses connected to industry and commerce shall remain untouched. All other properties of the landlords shall remain untouched. Digging up hidden wealth of landlords is strictly prohibited, and landlords are allowed to invest their hidden wealth in industry and commerce.
    3.  The industry and commerce run by landlords and old-style rich peasants, including the cart and horse transportation industry, shall not be confiscated and distributed. A strict distinction should be made between the industry and commerce run by landlords and old-style rich peasants and their feudal land property. The industry and commerce shall not be infringed upon due to the confiscation or requisition of feudal land property.
    4.  The land ownership and usage rights of all self-cultivating peasants, including land cultivated by hired labor by old-style rich peasants, shall remain unchanged. Those who rent out a small amount of land due to lack of labor or engagement in other occupations shall not be regarded as landlords or old-style rich peasants, and their land shall not be confiscated. They shall be allowed to continue to rent out, and the rent shall be negotiated by the landlord and tenant themselves.
    5.  All farmland, vegetable gardens, orchards, agricultural experiment fields, etc., cultivated with machines or with other advanced equipment, shall continue to be used by the original operators regardless of whether the ownership has changed.
    6.  Land owned by schools, clans, ancestral halls, temples, churches, public organizations, etc., shall be all nationalized and appropriately distributed. However, proper solutions should be devised for the funding of schools, orphanages, and hospitals that rely on the income from renting out land from school land or churches, etc. Monks and nuns who are willing to engage in agricultural production may also be allocated some land as appropriate. When dealing with the land of mosques, lama temples, and churches, it should be distinguished from the issue of religious belief, and full explanations should be given to believers.
    7.  When confiscating the land of landlords and requisitioning the land rented out by rich peasants, the graveyards and trees on the graveyards shall be protected and remain untouched.
    8.  The confiscated and requisitioned land, together with the original public land of the people's government, should be uniformly distributed on the basis of administrative villages. First, it should be distributed to landless and land-poor peasants in the village, but a certain amount of land may also be allocated to poor and unemployed workers and the poor who are willing to farm.
    9.  Those who use state-owned land in urban suburbs for farming shall no longer pay rent, but only pay agricultural tax in accordance with regulations.
    10. For heinous bullies who are deeply hated by the broad masses of the people, if the people demand punishment, specific charges and evidence should be collected and filed with the people's court, and the people's court shall impose the deserved punishment according to law. Random beatings and fines are prohibited.
    11. The executive organs for land reform shall be the peasant representative conferences or peasant congresses under the leadership of the municipal and district people's governments and the committees elected by them. The determination of the class status of landlords and rich peasants shall be assessed by the village peasant congress with the participation of the individuals concerned and submitted to the district people's government for approval.
    12. All arable wasteland shall be uniformly distributed by the people's government to landless and land-poor peasants for use, provided that it does not hinder urban construction, scenic spots, or landscapes. Those who reclaim wasteland shall be exempted from agricultural tax for one to three years.
    13. These measures only apply to agricultural land in urban suburbs. As for the agricultural land surrounding the urban districts and market towns under the jurisdiction of the county, it shall be handled in accordance with the existing regulations on land reform in the new areas.
                                      Premier of the State Administration Council Zhou Enlai
                                    January 13, 1950

    中央人民政府政务院关于处理老解放区市郊农业土地问题的指示
    （一九五零年一月十三日政务院第十五次政务会议通过）
    【新华社讯】一九五○年一月十三日政务院第十五次政务会议通过的《中央人民政府政务院关于处理老解放区市郊农业土地问题的指示》全文如下：
    消灭封建半封建剥削制度的土地改革，在东北业已全部完成，在河北、山西、察哈尔、绥远、平原和山东六省的老解放区亦已完成，若干小块新区也即将完成或正在贯彻实行，处在这些农村长期包围影响之下的城市郊区，实行土地改革的条件也已成熟，京津两市郊区并已开始实行；因此，决定京津两市及上述六省所属各市的郊区均应于今年春耕以前或秋收以后完成土地改革，但由于城市郊区在经济上与市内有密切联系，商品经济较为发达，解决城郊区土地问题又必须考虑到建设城市与发展工业的需要，故郊区的土地改革应与农村土地改革有若干区别，兹参照京津两市的若干经验，规定城市郊区土地改革若干办法如下：
    一、没收地主土地、征收旧式富农出租的土地，为了城市建设与工业发展之需要，一律归国家所有，由市人民政府管理，并分配给无地与少地农民使用。对愿意在土地改革后从事耕种以维持生活的地主，亦应分给他们与得地农民同样的一份土地，但对有其他收入以维持生活的地主则酌量少分或不分。
    二、没收地主的耕畜、农具及多余的粮食分配给农民，以解决农民生产资金之困难。并得征收地主在农村中的多余的房产，除大建筑及风景区的别墅等应根据市政建设的需要留充公用外，没收的房屋，应分配给农民居住，以解决贫苦农民住房缺乏的困难。所有与工商业相连的土地和房屋一律不动，地主的其他财产一律不动，一律不得追挖地主底财，并允许地主将底财投资于工业和商业。
    三、对地主、旧式富农兼营之工商业，包括车马运输业在内，不得没收和分配。地主、旧式富农兼营的工商业与封建的土地财产应加以严格区别，不得因没收或征收封建的土地财产而侵犯其工商业。
    四、所有自耕农民之土地，包括旧式富农雇工耕种之土地在内，其土地所有权与使用权照旧保持不变。所有因缺乏劳动力或从事其他职业而出租少量土地者，不得以地主或旧式富农论，其土地不在没收之列，并允许其继续出租，租额由东佃双方自行议定之。
    五、凡用机器耕种或有其他进步设备的农田及菜园、果园、农事试验场等，无论其所有权有无变动，一律仍由原经营者继续使用。
    六、学田、族田及祠堂、寺庙、教堂、公共社团等所有之土地应一律收归国家所有，并加以适当分配，但对依靠学田或教堂等出租土地之收入以维持的学校和孤儿院、医院等经费应拟具妥善的解决办法。僧尼之愿从事农业生产者亦得酌量分给一部土地。在处理清真寺、喇嘛寺及教堂土地时，应与宗教信仰问题区别开来，并应向教徒进行充分的解释。
    七、没收地主土地及征收富农出租土地时，坟地及坟地上之树木一律保护不动。
    八、没收和征收之土地，连同人民政府原有之公地，应以行政村为单位统一分配，首先分配给本村无地少地的农民，但对于贫苦的愿意种地的失业工人和贫民，亦得酌情分给一定数量的土地。
    九、凡使用城市郊区国有土地从事耕种者，一律不再交租，只照章缴纳农业税。
    十、对罪大恶极为广大群众所痛恨的恶霸分子，人民要求惩办者，应搜集具体罪状和证据向人民法院提起控诉，由人民法院依法判处以应得之罪刑，禁止乱打乱罚。
    十一、土地改革的执行机关，为市和区人民政府领导下的农民代表会议或农民大会及其选出的委员会。关于地主富农成份之划定，由村农民大会邀集本人参加评定之，并报请区人民政府批准。
    十二、一切可耕之荒地，在不妨碍城市建设名胜古迹或风景的条件下，由人民政府统一分配给无地少地之农民使用。垦种荒地者，一律免征农业税一年至三年。
    十三、本办法只适用于城市郊区的农业土地，至于县所属的城关区及集镇周围的农业土地则按各地现行的关于新区土地改革的规定处理之。
                                      政务院总理  周恩来
                                    一九五○年一月十三日
