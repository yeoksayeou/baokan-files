    Utilizing Special Products for Internal and External Exchange
    Tianjin Ephedrine Factory to be Established
    Upon Commencement, Monthly Production Can Reach 800 Pounds, Daily Requiring 10,000 Catties of Ephedra Grass, Maintaining the Livelihood of Grass-Collecting Farmers.
    [Our Dispatch] In order to utilize the special product of Rehe province, Ephedra grass, the Rehe Provincial People's Government is cooperating with the state-owned North China Pharmaceutical Factory to manufacture ephedrine. The Ephedra Extract Factory, originally planned to be built in Rehe Province, is now having its latest machinery designed by engineers from the North China Pharmaceutical Factory, so as to extract Ephedra Extract from Ephedra grass and transport it to the Tianjin Ephedrine Factory to be made into ephedrine. This will not only solve the domestic shortage of ephedrine, but also allow for export.
    Ephedrine has a wide range of uses in medicine. Since the production of "fatigue-reducing drugs" related to military affairs from ephedrine, its importance has attracted even more attention from the world. The manufacture of ephedrine requires Ephedra grass as a raw material. This grass is a special product of our country. From Tongliao in the northeast, through Chifeng to Nankou, along the Great Wall, and west to Jiayuguan, the end of the Great Wall on the border of Gansu and Xinjiang provinces, it is cut year after year and grows year after year. Not only is the production area vast and the output large, but the composition is also the best. Ephedra grass produced in Europe and other places is not suitable for the manufacture of ephedrine due to its composition. In the past, our country's Ephedra grass was mostly exported in large quantities. For example, from 1933 to 1936, North China exported 1,000 to 2,000 tons annually. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, exports ceased, and foreign countries used "synthetic ephedrine" (i.e., artificial products) instead. The efficacy of this substance is only 70% of that of natural ephedrine. The Rehe Provincial People's Government believes that exporting inexpensive Ephedra grass and importing synthetic ephedrine with low efficacy (it is estimated that Tianjin alone imports more than 10,000 taels per year) is an extremely unreasonable phenomenon. It has decided to jointly establish the "Rehe Province Ephedra Extract Factory" and the "Tianjin Ephedrine Factory" with the state-owned North China Pharmaceutical Factory. All investments are made by the Rehe Provincial Government, while the North China Pharmaceutical Factory is responsible for technical aspects. Currently, the factory buildings of both factories have been completed, and machinery is being ordered. Production will commence within four to six months. These two factories are the only ephedrine factories in our country, with novel equipment and a large scale. They can produce 820 pounds of ephedrine per month. They require 10,000 catties of Ephedra grass per day, which can maintain the livelihood of more than 1,000 grass-collecting farmers.

    利用特产内外交流
    津麻黄素厂筹备成立
    开工后每月可出产八百余磅，每日须用麻黄草万斤，可维持采草农民生活。
    【本报讯】热河省人民政府为利用热河特产之麻黄草，特与国营华北制药总厂合作，制造麻黄素。热河省原筹备建设中之麻黄膏厂，正由华北制药厂工程师设计最新机械，以便由麻黄草提制麻黄膏，运至天津麻黄素厂制成麻黄素。这样一方面解决了国内麻黄素缺乏之问题，另方面并可出口。
    麻黄素在医药上用途极广。自从由麻黄素中制成与军事有关之“避劳药品”后，其重要性更为世人注目。制造麻黄素须以麻黄草为原料。该草为我国之特产。东自东北的通辽，经赤峰至南口，沿长城内外，西至甘、新省界长城末端嘉峪关一带，年年割刈，年年生长。不但出产面积广，产量多，而且成份亦最佳。欧洲等处出产之麻黄草，因成份关系，不适于制麻黄素之用。以往我国麻黄草均系出口，为数颇巨，如一九三三至三六年，华北每年出口一千到二千吨。抗战后出口停止，国外均以“合成麻黄素”（即人工制品）代用。该物之效力只为天然麻黄素百分之七十。热河省人民政府认为出口廉价的麻黄草，进口效力低微的合成麻黄素（据估计，仅天津一地每年进口一万两以上），乃极不合理现象。决定与国营华北制药厂合办“热河省麻黄膏厂”及“天津麻黄素厂”，全部由热省府投资，而由华北制药厂负技术上责任。现两厂之厂房均已完工，正在订制机械，将在四个月至六个月内，开工生产。按该二厂为我国国内唯一之麻黄素厂，设备新颖，规模宏大。每月可产麻黄素八二○磅。每日需用麻黄草一万斤，可维持采草农民一千人以上之生活。
