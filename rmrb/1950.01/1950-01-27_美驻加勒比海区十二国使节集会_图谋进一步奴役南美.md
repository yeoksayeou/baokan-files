Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 26th: The conference of US ambassadors from twelve Caribbean nations, chaired by Assistant Secretary of State Miller, who is responsible for South American affairs, was held in Havana, the capital of Cuba, from the 18th to the 20th, lasting three days. The US State Department has also scheduled a conference of ambassadors to South American countries to be held in the Brazilian capital on March 1st.

The purpose of the twelve-nation ambassadorial conference is to further enslave the people of Latin America politically and economically.

According to a Havana dispatch from the Electric News Agency on January 23rd, the main issues discussed at the conference were as follows:

1.  Exerting pressure on Latin American governments to persecute the working class and people's democratic movements, and intensifying support for movements that divide the working class. The communique issued by the conference expressed "welcome" for the establishment of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions," an organization that serves American imperialism by splitting the working class.

2.  Opening up avenues for American capital in Latin America on a large scale, and breaking down the remaining protectionist barriers within Latin American countries. The communique stated that the conference found that the domestic policies of certain countries hindered the effective use of "foreign aid" and demanded that these countries create "necessary conditions" for "American aid."

3.  Intensifying control over Latin American trade. The conference condemned "the great possibility that many countries may adopt bilateral agreements to protect their export markets" and demanded that Washington control trade relations between Latin America and Western Europe through some form of "cooperative agreement."

4.  The conference announced its support for intensifying American efforts in "intelligence and cultural affairs," which means strengthening American espionage activities in Latin America.

The editorial of the weekly publication of the Cuban People's Socialist Party (Communist Party), "La Voz," stated: "The Havana Conference is a conference to accelerate the abolition of democratic freedoms, persecute anti-imperialist forces, stifle protests against foreign oppression, suppress patriotic sentiments, oppress national economies, and break down all obstacles hindering the expansion of American monopoly capital."

    美驻加勒比海区十二国使节集会
    图谋进一步奴役南美
    【新华社北京二十六日电】美国驻加勒比海区十二国大使会议，在负责南美事务的助理国务卿米勒主持之下，十八日起在古巴首都哈瓦那举行，历时三天，至二十日结束。美国务院并定于三月一日，在巴西首都举行驻南美各国大使的会议。
    十二国大使会议的目的，在于进一步在政治上和经济上奴役拉丁美洲人民。
    据电通社哈瓦那二十三日消息，会议所讨论的主要问题如下：
    一、对拉丁美洲各国政府施行压力，迫害工人阶级和人民民主运动，并加紧支持分裂工人阶级运动。会议发表的公报对于为美国帝国主义服务的分裂工人阶级的机构——“国际自由工会联合会”的成立，表示“欢迎”。
    二、大规模地为美国资本在拉丁美洲开辟道路，打破拉丁美洲国家内残存的保护壁垒。公报称，会议发现某些国家的国内政策阻碍“国外援助”的有效使用，并要求这些国家为“美援”创造“必要的条件”。
    三、加紧控制拉丁美洲贸易。会议谴责“许多国家可能采取双边协定，以保护其出口市场的巨大可能性”，并要求华盛顿通过某种“合作协定”的方式，来控制拉丁美洲和西欧间的贸易关系。
    四、会议宣布赞成加紧美国在“情报与文化方面”的工作，这就是要加强美国在拉丁美洲的间谍活动。
    古巴人民社会党（共产党）的机关报《呼声》报星期刊的社论称：“哈瓦那会议是一个为了加速取消民主自由，迫害反帝国主义力量，窒息对外国压迫的抗议，压抑爱国情绪，压迫民族经济及打破一切妨碍美国垄断资本扩张的各种障碍的会议。”
