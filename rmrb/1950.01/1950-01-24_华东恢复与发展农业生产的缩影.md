A Microcosm of the Restoration and Development of Agricultural Production in East China
By our Shanghai Correspondent, Zi Qin

    Inside the exhibition hall of the East China Agricultural Exhibition, there is a chart illustrating the arduous task of restoring agricultural production in the East China region in 1950. In 1936, the area of ​​food crops in East China was 407.88 million mu, with a yield of 89 billion jin; in 1949, it was 333 million mu, with a yield of 45 billion jin. The cultivated area decreased by 20 percent, and the yield decreased by 40 percent. In 1936, the cotton planting area was 15 million mu, producing 5.42 million dan of ginned cotton, with an average yield of 28.4 jin per mu (the most abundant year). In 1949, the region only planted 10.7 million mu of cotton, producing 2.08 million dan of ginned cotton, with an average yield of 19.5 jin per mu. The cultivated area decreased by 30 percent, and the yield decreased by 50 percent. According to the "restoring production as the main focus" policy instructed by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, it is still a very arduous task to restore agricultural production in East China to the pre-war level.

            Restoring and Developing Agricultural Production Starts with Solving the Land Problem for Farmers in Newly Liberated Areas

    In many charts and explanations, the agricultural exhibition pointed out more than once that to restore and develop agricultural production in 1950, the first step is to widely and effectively organize the farmers in the newly liberated areas, eliminate the feudal system of exploitation in the countryside, carry out rent reduction, anti-hegemony campaigns, and land reform, and solve the farmers' land problem. At the same time, efforts should be stepped up to control floods and provide disaster relief, combining science and the masses.

    Last year's waterlogging, drought, and insect pests in East China caused serious damage to agricultural production. In terms of waterlogging: last year, 50 million mu of land was flooded in East China, with a loss of 7.5 billion jin of grain. Wheat bunt (also known as black wheat) occurred in 32 counties in Shandong last year. The proportion of diseased plants generally reached 30 percent, and in some cases as high as 80 percent. In addition, locusts in the Bohai area of ​​Shandong harmed 2.7 million mu of crops last year, and armyworms harmed 1.4 million mu of rice. Mole crickets harmed wheat in central and southern Shandong and Jiaodong, reaching 510,000 mu, while in Bohai they affected the entire area. Aphids caused a 15 percent reduction in cotton production. Rice stem borers in southern Jiangsu caused a reduction of 20 to 30 million jin in rice production, accounting for one-third to one-half of the total output.

    The agricultural exhibition provided many examples of the prevention and elimination of the above-mentioned disasters: In order to alleviate flooding, large-scale flood control and disaster relief movements were launched one after another in various parts of East China last year, and great achievements have been made. The basic key lies in organizing and mobilizing millions of people and disaster victims, adopting the method of "work relief and disaster relief," and combining science and technology with the broad masses. In the Daoyi project in Shandong, more than 3,000 team leaders and higher-level cadres received technical training before construction began. The cadres initially learned engineering techniques and passed them on to the masses. Coupled with strong political leadership and organization and mobilization, the completion of the first phase of the project plan was effectively guaranteed. In the prevention and control of pests and diseases, Shandong also provided very important experience in the prevention and control of wheat bunt: When preventing and controlling wheat bunt in the central and southern regions of Shandong, the method of pure seed was initially adopted, but it was not only ineffective, but the most severely affected areas even increased to 90 percent. Later, after in-depth visits and investigations to 17 wheat bunt farmers, it was found that wheat bunt can be transmitted by seeds and fertilizers containing wheat bunt bacteria. It is necessary to carry out pure manure at the same time as pure seed. The method of pure seed and pure manure was then proposed. After repeated in-depth publicity and mobilization, and typical experiments on 23 households, success was finally achieved. This educated the peasants and broke the peasants' superstitious and fatalistic thinking. It turned the scientific method of treating wheat bunt into the conscious action of the broad masses, and thus gained important experience in treating wheat bunt.

            Strengthen Flood Control and Disaster Relief, Improve Varieties... Combining Science and Technology with the Masses

    In addition, in mid-May last year, a locust plague occurred in 26 counties in the Bohai region, covering an area of ​​427,448 mu. Under the leadership of the government, the people of various counties mobilized 54,117 men and women, and completely eliminated the insect plague through two months of catching, killing with medicine, and other methods. Under the leadership of county government cadres, the locust catching work in Guangrao County mobilized the masses extensively and in-depth, brought into play the wisdom of the masses, and created methods such as fire attack, plowing, catching, digging ditches for blockade, etc. The government also sent a large number of insecticide powder to the masses, and sprayed it with a sprayer in an aqueous solution of 0.2% to 0.5%. The insecticide effect reached 90%. The local locusts were completely eliminated, and the spring seedlings were preserved.

    The exhibition also provides many insecticides, such as the latest insecticide with 100% effectiveness, fish vine extract with 90% effectiveness... etc. However, these agents are too expensive and difficult for the masses to purchase, and the output is too small to be widely promoted in rural areas. Therefore, how to manufacture a low-cost insecticide that is easy to promote universally, or that farmers can manufacture themselves in rural areas, still requires further research from the scientific community.

    Regarding variety improvement: "Hanxian No. 6506" collected by the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute has a yield of 556 jin per mu, and "Wanxian No. 9" has a yield of 579.2 jin per mu (other general grains are all over 300 jin). The rice varieties "Zhongnong No. 4" and "Victory Xian" produce four more sheng of rice per dan than ordinary varieties. Shandong's "Shaoping Yangmai" yields 375 jin per mu, while local varieties only yield 150 jin. "Yanda 811 Gu" yields 500 jin per mu, while local varieties only yield 250 jin. "Golden Queen" corn yields 611 jin per mu, while local varieties only yield 250 jin. The above-mentioned improved varieties have yield increases of 10 to more than 100 percent. However, how to promote the adoption of improved varieties is still an urgent problem to be solved.

    华东恢复与发展农业生产的缩影
    本报驻沪记者  子芹
    华东农业展览会的陈列馆内有一张图表，指示出一九五○年华东区恢复农业生产的艰巨任务。华东区在一九三六年食用作物面积为四○七八八万亩，产量八九○亿斤；一九四九年为三三三○○万亩，产量四五○亿斤，耕作面积缩减了百分之二○，产量减少百分之四○；植棉面积一九三六年一五○○万亩，产皮棉五四二万担，平均每亩产量二八·四斤（最丰年），一九四九年全区只植棉一○七○万亩，产皮棉二○八万担，每亩平均产量一九·五斤，耕作面积减少百分之三○，产量减少百分之五○。根据中央人民政府农业部指示以“恢复生产为主”的方针，华东区农业生产要恢复到战前水平，还是一个十分艰巨的任务。
            恢复发展农业生产首先解决新区农民土地问题
    农展会在许多图表和说明中，不止一次的指出：要恢复与发展一九五○年的农业生产，首先是把新区的农民广泛有力的组织起来，消灭农村的封建剥削制度，进行减租、反霸及土地改革，解决农民土地问题。同时，并加紧治水救灾，作到科学与群众结合。
    华东去年的水旱虫灾，曾给了农业生产上以严重的损害。水灾方面：去年华东区被淹土地五千万亩，损失粮食七十五亿斤，山东小麦腥黑穗病（即乌麦），去年在三十二个县内发生，病株一般达百分之三十，多者达百分之八十。又山东渤海区的蝗虫，去年为害作物二七○万亩，行军虫为害稻谷一四○万亩。蝼蛄为害小麦在鲁中南、胶东达五十一万亩，渤海则害及全区，蚜虫为害使棉花减产百分之十五，苏南地区螟虫为害使水稻减产二——三千万斤，占总产量三分之一到二分之一。
    对以上灾害的防治和消除，农展会提供了许多实例：为了解除水患，去年全华东各地均已先后展开了规模宏大的治水救灾运动，而且已获得了很大的成绩。基本关键就在于组织与动员千百万群众和灾民，采用“以工代赈，救灾渡荒”的办法，使科学技术与广大群众相结合。山东导沂工程，在开工前由于进行了三千多名小队长以上干部的技术训练，干部初步的学会了工程技术，并将他转教给群众；加上政治上的坚强领导和组织动员，有效的保证了第一期工程计划的完成。在病虫害的防治上，山东防治乌麦病害时，也提供了很重要的经验：山东鲁中南区防治乌麦病时，开始采用净种办法，不仅毫无效果，而且病害最重地区甚至增加到百分之九十。后来经过了对十七家乌麦病农户的深入访问和调查，发现乌麦病害由种子及带有乌麦病菌的肥料，都可传染，必须在净种同时进行净粪，便提出了净种净粪的办法，经过反复深入的宣传动员，和对二十三家农户的典型试验，终于获得了成功。并以此教育了农民，打破了农民迷信与听天由命的思想。使治乌麦病的科学方法变成了广大群众的自觉行动，因而在治乌麦病害上获得了重要的经验。
            加强治水救灾改良品种……使科学技术与群众结合
    此外，渤海区去年五月中旬在二十六个县发生的蝗灾，面积达四二七四四八市亩，各县人民在政府领导下，动员了男女五四一一七人，经两月时间捕打、药杀等办法，完全消灭了虫灾。广饶县的捕虫工作在县府干部率领下，经过广泛深入的动员，发挥群众智慧，创造了火攻、犁耙、捕打、挖沟封锁等办法，政府更以大批杀虫粉送给群众，按百分之○·二到百分之○·五的水溶液，以喷雾器喷杀，杀虫效果达到百分之九十。完全消灭了土蝗，保住了春苗。
    展览会更提供了许多杀虫药剂，如最新杀虫药效力达百分之百，鱼藤精效力达百分之九十……等等，但这些药剂一则价值太高，群众不易购买，一则出量太少，难于广泛推行到农村；因此，如何制造一种成本低廉，且易普遍推行，或在农村中农民自己即可制造的杀虫药剂，还须科学界进一步的研究。
    关于品种改良：浙江省农业改进所采集的“旱籼六五○六号”，每亩产量五五六市斤，“晚籼九号”每亩产五七九·二市斤（其他一般谷皆在三百多斤），又水稻“中农四号”谷和“胜利籼”品种，比普通品种每石多出四升米，山东“邵平洋麦”每亩产三七五斤，而土种则只产一五○斤，“燕大八一一谷”每亩产五○○斤，土种只二五○斤，“金皇后”玉米每亩产六一一斤，土种只产二五○斤。以上良种增产量皆为百分之十到一百以上。但如何推广采用优良品种，还是急需解决的问题。
