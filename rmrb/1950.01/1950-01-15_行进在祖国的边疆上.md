Putting the Red Flag All Over the Borders of the Motherland

    Marching on the Borders of the Motherland
    Wang Qi
    After completing the task of annihilating the enemy in the Guangdong-Guangxi area, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, which was victoriously advancing to the southwest, immediately passed through the southwestern corner of Guangdong - the area under the jurisdiction of Fangcheng - and victoriously advanced along the Sino-Vietnamese border. When the enemy's rear people's armed forces - the Third Detachment of the Guangdong-Guangxi Border Column - held high the red flag and crossed the mountains and forests to meet the southward-bound army in a victorious meeting, the two brotherly troops felt infinite excitement.
    Separated by only one Beilun River, the opposite bank is Vietnamese territory. The slogan raised by the soldiers after crossing the Yangtze River, "Plant the red flag all over the borders of the motherland," has been victoriously realized today.
    When the troops arrived at the southernmost corner of our mainland - Dongxing City, they were immediately warmly welcomed by the local people. Every household in the town was filled with national flags, and the streets were crowded. Only a bridge away from Dongxing is Mong Cai in Vietnam, and our great red five-star national flag is hoisted high on the Beilun River bridge gate.
    The troops continued to advance along the national boundary Lingjiang, and arrived at Naliang Town in the evening. Naliang was liberated as early as June in the old lunar calendar of 1949 by the Third Detachment of our Guangdong-Guangxi Border Column. As soon as the troops approached the town, the sound of welcoming firecrackers shattered the night sky. The whole town was lit with lanterns and flags, and the people held torches high to welcome the liberating army. From 8:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m., the whole town was like a boiling pot.
    The troops continued to advance along the border line, entering the area of the Ten Thousand Mountains. The mountains rise high into the clouds, and rivers are intricately interspersed among them. It is also a time of continuous rain. The mountains are steep and the roads are slippery. In one day, one has to wade through more than ten rapid currents. It is even more difficult to move an inch at night. The soldiers have been advancing day and night since the area south of Lianjiang, traveling at least a hundred li and at most two hundred and twenty li every day. When they arrived here, although they were very tired, the belief in "liberating all of China and planting the red flag all over the borders of the motherland" supported them. Holding up the blazing torches, wringing out their soaked single clothes, they continued to advance bravely and vigorously.

    行进在祖国的边疆上
    王起
    向西南胜利进军的人民解放军某部，在粤桂地区完成歼敌任务后，立即穿过广东的西南角——防城所属地区沿着中越边境胜利前进。当敌后人民武装——粤桂边纵队三支队同志，高举着红旗穿越山岭丛林，前来与南下大军胜利会师时，两支兄弟部队感到无限的兴奋。
    仅仅一条北仑河之隔，对面便是越南境地了。战士们在渡过长江后所提出的“把红旗插遍祖国的边疆”的口号，今天胜利地实现了。
    在部队到达我国大陆顶南角——东兴市时，立即受到当地人民的热烈欢迎，镇内家家户户遍插国旗，街道被挤得水泄不通。与东兴仅一桥之隔对岸，便是越南的芒街，我们伟大的红色五星国旗便高插在北仑河桥门上。
    部队沿国界岭江续向前进，晚间抵达那良镇。那良早于一九四九年旧历六月即被我粤桂边纵队三支队解放，部队刚一接近该镇，欢迎的爆竹声震破黑夜的天空，全镇张灯悬旗，人民高举着火把欢迎解放大军。从晚间八时直到午夜一时，全镇像沸腾了一样。
    部队沿国境线继续前进，进入十万大山地区。山高插入云霄，河流综错其间，又正值阴雨连绵，山陡路滑，一天之间要徒涉十几次急流，一到黑夜更是寸步难行。而战士们则是从廉江以南地区即不分昼夜前进，每天最少百里，最多二百二十里，到了这里，虽则是十分疲乏，但“解放全中国，把红旗插遍祖国的边疆”的信念支持着他们，举着熊熊的火把，拧干了湿透了的单衣，继续猛勇前进。
