Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 25th: According to the Jakarta (Batavia) Chinese newspaper "Life Report" citing a Bangkok dispatch: In February of last year, the Thai authorities announced the "reservation" of ten occupations, prohibiting overseas Chinese from engaging in them. One of these, the barbering industry, had applied for "leniency" and was granted an extension of the business period. Now that the leniency period is about to expire, approximately 10,000 compatriots and their families who rely on the barbering industry for a living are facing the threat of unemployment. At the same time, the leniency period for the forced relocation out of the city of eight types of factories operated by overseas Chinese in Bangkok (such as dim sum food, dyeing factories, rice noodles, tofu, etc.), totaling 500, employing 10,000 workers, is also about to expire. The Thai government and the Industrial Adjustment Committee have both stated that they are unwilling to grant any further leniency.
