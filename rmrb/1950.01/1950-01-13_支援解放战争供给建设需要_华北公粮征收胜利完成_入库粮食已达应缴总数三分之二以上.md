To Support the Supply and Construction Needs of the Liberation War
North China Victoriously Completes Public Grain Collection
Grain Storage Exceeds Two-Thirds of the Total Due
Autumn Grain Collection Policy Earnestly Supported After Discussions by Representatives From All Sectors of Counties and Districts
[Report from this newspaper] The autumn grain collection work in the provinces and cities of North China in 1949 has basically been completed victoriously, with the amount of grain collected and stored exceeding two-thirds of the total grain due. After the Second North China Financial Conference in September last year determined the agricultural tax collection tasks for each province and city, the provinces, cities, and special districts immediately began preparations for autumn grain collection, convened financial conferences at all levels, explaining that doing a good job in tax collection was of paramount importance for continuing to support the Liberation War and restoring and rebuilding the national economy; they also discussed and allocated the burden tasks for each region, organized and mobilized cadres to go to the countryside to assist and promote autumn grain collection. Most counties discussed and arranged the work through representative meetings of all sectors, and the autumn grain collection policy was enthusiastically supported by the broad masses. In some places in Chahar and Hebei, in addition to doing a good job in publicity, mobilization, and organization during the autumn grain collection work, new leadership methods such as awarding autumn grain collection models were adopted, setting off a heat wave of early and good grain delivery, enabling autumn grain collection to be completed quickly and satisfactorily. For example, Yanggao County in Chahar Province was able to make good use of methods such as competition and awarding models. The entire county completed 60% of the public grain due within six days. When Dongyuan Village in the county challenged other villages in competition, the cadres worked extremely conscientiously and responsibly, did a good job in publicity and mobilization, and there were no phenomena of coercion or commandism. Communist Party members played a leading role, so the masses paid public grain extremely enthusiastically, completing the entire village's public grain due in two and a half days, and the quality of the public grain was very good. When Yanggao held a democratic assessment of models, the village was rated first place, and the county government gave it a special commendation.

In addition to discussing and arranging autumn grain collection tasks through county representative meetings of all sectors, most districts in North China also convened district representative meetings, and villages convened mass meetings. Before the meetings, the village Communist Party branch and the village government discussed and studied the issues, then went to the masses to solicit opinions, and then decided after discussions at mass meetings, assigning the tasks to each household. Therefore, generally speaking, the masses in various places recognized that this was a duty that the people should fulfill to the country, their enthusiasm was high, and they vied to deliver public grain to the government.
    
       Task allocation is fair and reasonable, cadres and Party members take the lead, and the masses rush to deliver day and night.
Liu, a farmer in the third district of Xuanhua County, Chahar Province, drove three donkeys all night to deliver grain, saying: Delivering public grain is for our own army to eat. If it weren't for the People's Liberation Army, I wouldn't have been allocated three mu of land. When the autumn grain collection task in Mancheng County, Hebei Province, was assigned to villages and households, farmers milled rice, picked cotton, and shelled peanuts day and night. Jin Tinghe's mother in Beisong Village in the county shelled 110 jin of peanuts in three days, and a 60-year-old woman surnamed Wu milled 170 jin of rice in one night. There are many such touching stories in the collection of public grain in various places. Jingxing County in Hebei Province is a relatively barren area that is often hit by disasters, but it completed all collection figures in seven days. In Chahar Province, except for Chabei, which was delayed due to the rat plague lockdown, all places were assigned to households by November 15 last year, and Zuoyun County completed all and exceeded the quota by more than 2,000 jin on the 17th. Zhangzitou Village in the suburbs of Taiyuan City completed the autumn grain collection task in one day under the leadership of cadres and Party members. As of the end of December last year, Hebei Province had actually completed about 80% of the total autumn grain collection task, and the amount collected and stored accounted for 70% of the total amount due in the province. In Pingyuan Province, the amount collected and stored accounted for more than 48% of the total. In Chahar Province, in addition to completing the total amount due, it exceeded 10 million jin. The suburbs of Beijing and Tianjin have completed about half of the total collection amount for the year. Shanxi and Suiyuan Provinces are currently making every effort to promote the work.
   
       New successful experience
Representatives from all walks of life discussed and arranged the work, widely publicized and explained the policies to the masses, and played a significant role in the autumn grain collection work.

In this collection work, several important experiences were gained. First, discussing and arranging autumn grain collection through representative meetings of all sectors allowed the broad masses of people to understand the state's financial difficulties and the policies of the People's Government, and fully promoted the spirit of democracy through deliberation and discussion. The representatives returned to the masses and publicized and explained the government's burden policies to the masses, which played a significant role in the autumn grain collection work. Second, the leaders were responsible, cleared the cadres' thinking, and then used the method of specifically calculating accounts with the masses, pointing out to the masses that there was no war-related burden in 1949, which reduced consumption and enabled them to concentrate on production and increase income; firewood and grass were not collected this year, and the conversion rate of various grains was lower than in previous years. On the surface, the figures for autumn grain collection in 1949 were higher than in previous years, but in reality, the burden was reduced. Explaining this clearly to the masses greatly helped to complete the autumn grain collection. For example, in Wujiahu Village in Puyang County, Pingyuan Province, the masses reflected that they had to pay 20 jin per standard mu this year, but only 18 jin last year. A cadre in a certain village explained: Although it was 18 jin last year, there was also a firewood and grass fee of 6 jin per mu to supply the front line, which added up to 24 jin. This year, there is no need for firewood and grass. The masses realized this, which greatly helped to complete the collection of public grain.

Some problems and biases also occurred during the grain collection process. The main ones were that the cadres' work style was rough and careless, they did not have a good grasp of the situation, and the distribution was unfair, resulting in uneven burdens. Some cadres were eager to achieve success and did not discuss or deliberate, resulting in coercion and commandism, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses. In a very few areas, such as Hua County in Pingyuan Province, there were even incidents of detaining the masses. Some cadres were irresponsible and afraid of trouble, and they averaged the disaster relief reductions instead of following the instructions of the higher-level government, deciding according to the severity of each household's disaster. For example, the Fifth District of Qingfeng, Pingyuan Province, left a small portion of the 3% reduction and exemption amount to solve individual households affected by disasters, and distributed the majority equally to general burden households. This phenomenon occurred in various places and was a shortcoming in the autumn grain collection in 1949. There were also very individual areas that arbitrarily "increased the burden surface and expanded the reduction and exemption amount," which was a serious act of being unorganized and undisciplined and should be criticized. Most of these biases have been quickly corrected after being discovered.

    支援解放战争供给建设需要
    华北公粮征收胜利完成
    入库粮食已达应缴总数三分之二以上
    经县区各界代表会讨论秋征政策获得热诚拥护
    【本报讯】华北各省市一九四九年的秋征工作基本上已胜利完成，收缴入库的粮食已达应征粮总数的三分之二以上。去年九月华北第二届财政会议确定各省、市农业征收任务后，各省、市、专区立即展开了有关秋征的准备工作，召开了各级财政会议，说明为了继续支援解放战争，恢复和重建国民经济，作好征收工作具有头等重要意义；并讨论分配了各地区的负担任务，组织动员干部下乡，协助推动秋征。大部县份均通过各界代表会议讨论布置，秋征政策获得广大群众的热诚拥护。察哈尔、河北有些地方在展开秋征工作中，除作好宣传动员和组织外，并采用了评奖秋征模范的新领导方法，掀起了早缴和缴好公粮的热潮，使秋征得以迅速圆满完成。如察哈尔省阳高县因能很好地运用竞赛、评奖模范等方法，全县在六天内就完成了应缴公粮的百分之六十，该县的东园村与别村挑战竞赛时，干部工作极为认真负责，宣传动员作得好，没有强迫命令的现象，共产党员起了带头作用，因此群众缴纳公粮极为踊跃，两天半就完成了全村应缴的公粮，公粮质量很好。在阳高民主评奖模范时，该村被评为第一名，县政府并特予表扬。
    华北各地除通过县各界代表会议讨论布置秋征任务外，绝大多数的区还召开了区代表会，村召开了群众大会，开会前村的共产党支部和村政府讨论研究后，再到群众中进行酝酿，听取大家的意见，然后经过群众大会讨论决定，将任务分配到每一户。因此一般说来，各地群众都认识了这是人民对于国家应尽的义务，情绪高涨，争先恐后地将公粮送交政府。
            任务分配公平合理，干部、党员带头，群众昼夜赶送。
    察哈尔省宣化县三区有一个姓刘的农民，一人赶三头毛驴，连夜赶送，他说：送公粮是给咱自己军队吃，要不是解放军，我就分不到三亩地。河北省满城县秋征任务布置到村与户时，农民昼夜碾米、拣棉花、剥花生仁。该县北宋村金亭和的母亲，三天剥花生仁百一十斤，一个姓吴的六十岁的大娘一晚上就碾米一百七十斤。这种动人的事情，在各地征收公粮中是很多的。河北省的井陉县是比较贫瘠且常遭灾荒的地区，七天就完成了全部收缴数字。察哈尔省除察北因鼠疫封锁布置较晚外，各地在去年十一月十五日布置到户，左云县在十七日就全部完成并超过应交数字两千多斤。太原市郊区丈子头村在干部党员的带头下，一天就完成了秋征任务。截至去年十二月底，河北省实际完成秋征总数的百分之八十左右，收缴入库的则为全省应缴数字的百分之七十，平原省收缴入库的占总数的百分之四十八点多，察哈尔省除全部完成应征数外，并超过了一千万斤。北京、天津两市郊区均已完成全年征收总数的一半左右。山西、绥远两省现正全力推动中。
            新的成功的经验
    各界代表讨论布置以后，广泛向群众宣传解释政策，对秋征工作起了很大作用。
    在这次征收工作中，获得几点较为重要的经验。第一是通过各界代表会讨论布置秋征，这样，国家财政困难的情况和人民政府的政策为广大人民所了解，并经过酝酿讨论，充分发扬了民主精神。代表回到群众中，向群众宣传解释政府的负担政策，这对秋征工作，起了很大作用。第二是领导负责，打通干部思想，然后用与群众具体算账的方法，向群众指出：一九四九年战勤负担没有了，一方面减少了消费，同时又能安心生产增加收入；今年不征柴草，各种粮食的折合率又较往年低，表面上看一九四九年秋征的数字比往年高，实际则减轻了。把这一个道理明白的向群众说清楚，对于秋征的完成有很大帮助。如平原省濮阳县五甲户村有群众反映：今年一个标准亩要交二十斤，去年才十八斤。某村干部解释说：去年虽是十八斤，但因为供给前线需要还有六斤米的柴草费，加起来就二十四斤了。今年不要柴草了。群众认识到这一点，对于完成征收公粮有很大作用。
    在征粮中也曾发生了一些毛病和偏向，主要是干部作风粗枝大叶，掌握情况不够，分配不公平，造成畸重畸轻的现象。有些干部急于求成，不讨论，不酝酿，发生强迫命令，引起群众不满，甚至有极少数地区，如平原省滑县曾发生扣押群众的事。也有些干部不负责任、怕麻烦，将灾区的减征数平均分配，而不是按照上级政府的指示。按照每一户受灾的轻重来决定，如平原省清丰五区将百分之三的减免数留出少部分解决个别受灾户外，大部平均分配到一般负担户。此种现象在各地均曾发生，是一九四九年秋征中的一个缺点。还有极个别地区擅自“提高负担面，扩大减免数”，是严重的无组织无纪律行为，应受到批评。以上这些偏向经发现后，多数地区均已迅速纠正。
