Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 24th: TASS Moscow: At the commemorative meeting held in Moscow on the 21st, the 26th anniversary of Lenin's death, Pospelov gave a report entitled: Advancing Towards the Victory of Communism Under the Invincible Great Banner of Lenin and Stalin. The full text is as follows:

    Comrades! Twenty-six years have passed since that sorrowful day, January 21, 1924, when Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the father of our Soviet revolution, the founder of the Bolshevik Party and the socialist state, the great teacher, leader and friend of the working people of the world, passed away.

    Lenin's name is the most beloved name of the working people and the exploited masses. Lenin's immortal cause survives, and will forever endure for generations to come. Our people and all progressive humanity are grateful to Vladimir Ilyich Lenin for the achievements of the great October Socialist Revolution of 1917. This was the revolution he prepared, a revolution that ushered in a new era in world history, the era of the collapse of capitalism and the victory of socialism, which constitutes the beginning of the true history of mankind.

    Lenin pointed out: "To destroy capitalism and its remnants, to lay the foundation of the communist order, this is the content of the new era of world history that has now begun." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian Edition, Volume 25, page 469)

    Vladimir Ilyich Lenin founded and nurtured the battle-tested Communist Party. Under his leadership, our people began to build the world's first worker-peasant socialist state and defended their Soviet state against the fierce attacks of imperialism and the White Guards. Lenin indicated the great goal of building socialism in our country and pointed out the broad road to achieve this goal.

    Comrade Stalin and Lenin founded the Party together, led the great October Socialist Revolution together, and established the Soviet state together. During the Civil War and the period of imperialist intervention, he and Lenin jointly commanded the defense of the socialist motherland and guided our country's transition to peaceful construction. Lenin's cause has been continued, and is still being continued, by his faithful student, friend and comrade-in-arms, Comrade Stalin, which is the greatest fortune for our country and all progressive humanity. Comrade Stalin leads our people and all progressive humanity with Leninist wisdom, along the new historical road illuminated by the brilliance of Marxist-Leninist scientific theory, along the road of struggle and victory of hundreds of millions of working people. We are grateful to Comrade Stalin for sacredly fulfilling Lenin's legacy of striving for the great victory of socialism, the great victory of socialism that has a truly decisive significance for the destiny of future generations.

    Following Lenin's legacy, our country has built a socialist society under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, and the construction of communism is developing victoriously. The Soviet Union has become a powerful socialist country, an important international force that influences the entire international situation and fundamentally changes it in accordance with the interests of the working people. The socialist country that saved the people of Europe and the people of the world from fascist enslavement, a country where all nationalities are equal and friendly, has become an indestructible fortress of peace, democracy and socialism.

    This is why the working people of our country and the world celebrate the seventieth birthday of Comrade Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, with such love. The celebration of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin's seventieth birthday has become a magnificent expression of the unity and friendship of all peace-loving people and the working people of all countries, an expression unprecedented in its strength. They regard Comrade Stalin as their beloved teacher and friend, the banner of peace and mankind's march towards freedom and happiness!

    I. The Soviet People are Realizing Lenin's Legacy and Advancing Confidently Towards Communism.

    Our Party has overcome incredible difficulties to ensure the victory of socialism in our country, turning our motherland from a technically and economically backward country into a powerful socialist state. The Party of Lenin and Stalin has led our people to the victory of socialism and created decisive conditions for the historical victory of socialism and democracy in several countries in Europe and Asia, primarily because it is a Marxist party, a Leninist party, because the Party's policy is based on Marxist-Leninist social science. The Party of Lenin and Stalin, in all its activities, in the storms of history, in the tortuous historical road, has been, and still is, guided by the true compass of the invincible Marxist-Leninist doctrine, and the Marxist-Leninist doctrine is being developed and enriched by Comrade Stalin.

    Marx and Engels first created the scientific theory of communism, scientifically proving that capitalism is a historically temporary social system, proving the inevitability of the bourgeoisie's demise and the proletariat's seizure of power, and the inevitability of socialism replacing capitalism.

    Marx and Engels taught the working class to be aware of its own strength, to be aware of its great historical mission as the gravedigger of the capitalist system. Marx and Engels gave the proletariat a powerful spiritual weapon – revolutionary theory.

    Marx and Engels maintained close contact with the labor movement of their time and with its most advanced fighters. In the revolutionary labor movement, in the International Workingmen's Association (i.e., the First International) founded under Marx's guidance, they saw the harbinger of a new society, a new society being born to replace the old capitalist society. "…In contrast to the old society with its economic poverty and political madness, a new society is emerging, whose international rule will be peace, because its national ruler will be everywhere the same – labor!" (Marx made this prediction in the first declaration of the General Council of the International Workingmen's Association on the Franco-Prussian War.)

    The new socialist society born in our country in October 1917 established Soviet power, the power of the working people, and made peace its international rule. This society has proven the great and complete correctness of the words of our immortal teacher Lenin. Lenin said: "Socialism itself possesses enormous power, and mankind has now entered a new stage of development that offers very bright prospects." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian Edition, Volume 27, page 415)

    Marx and Engels lived in an era when capitalism was still developing upward, when the proletarian revolution had not yet become a direct, practical necessity. They could not see the demise of the capitalist system and the birth of a new society, but they predicted the birth of a new society with scientific precision.

    Lenin and Stalin inherited the cause of Marx and Engels in the new era, the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution.

    Lenin discovered the laws of capitalist development in the era of imperialism, when it began to develop downhill, when once "prosperous" capitalism became dying, decaying capitalism. Lenin theoretically proved the possibility of the victory of socialism in one country.

    Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the chain of the world imperialist front was broken for the first time, and the great October Socialist Revolution was victorious.

    Lenin devoted his life to the cause of the working class, to the cause of the victory of socialism. Lenin clearly and surely foresaw the road to the victory of socialism. He taught the Party and the people what road to follow to ensure the victory of socialism in our country and internationally.

    In pointing out the road forward to socialism, Lenin clearly put forward the task of industrializing our country and warned that without industrialization, the position of our independent country in general would be eliminated. The Leninist strategy was to maintain the leadership of the working class over the peasantry, to ensure the restoration and development of large-scale machine industry, to ensure the implementation of the electrification plan, and to carry out the socialist transformation of the small peasant economy on this basis.

    Lenin predicted: "...if Russia is covered with a dense network of power stations and high-tech factories, our communist economic construction will become a model for the future socialist Europe and Asia." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian Edition, Volume 26, page 48)

    Comrade Stalin, in the struggle against the enemies of Leninism, upheld and developed the theory that socialism could be victorious in one country, and concretized Lenin's strategic plan for building socialism (the starting point of which was the idea of industrialization).

    Following Lenin's legacy, Comrade Stalin, with great insight, presented the task of rapidly carrying out socialist industrialization to the Party and the people, in order to maintain the independence of our socialist motherland and ensure the victory of socialism. Comrade Stalin said at the First All-Union Conference of Socialist Industry Workers in February 1931: "We are fifty to one hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must close this gap within ten years. Either we can do this, or we will be crushed."

    Our country has completed the great cause of socialist industrialization in a historically significant period—the period designated by Comrade Stalin. This is precisely why, ten years later, in 1941, when Hitler's Germany pounced on our country with a perfidious attack, it could not overwhelm us. Our socialist country surpassed Hitler's Germany, which had the economy of the entire European continent at its disposal, in terms of military, industrial and economic power. This socialist country finally won the decisive battle against fascism, liberating the people of Europe from fascist enslavement.

    The Soviet people owe this epoch-making victory of socialism primarily to the wise leadership of the great leader and teacher of the Party and the people, and to the greatest strategist and commander of all time—Comrade Stalin.

    The Party of Lenin and Stalin inspired the masses with the great plan of building socialism in our country, and it defeated the traitors and capitulationists—those who attempted to infect the Party and the people with the Menshevik sentiment that socialism could not be victorious, and who intended to drive our country towards the path of capitalist restoration. All these Menshevik followers—Trotskyites, Zinovievites, Bukharinites, bourgeois nationalists—were never Marxists, they were only masquerading as Marxists "in disguise." The fundamental reason why they adopted a treacherous position, why they became direct pawns of the capitalist encirclement, and traitors to the motherland, lies in their most vile and filthy flattery towards the imaginary "omnipotence" of the capitalist system.

    The Lenin-Stalinist theory that socialism could be victorious in our country, after being closely combined with the masses, has become a powerful material force. In several Stalinist Five-Year Plans, this force has been manifested in the heroic labor of the Soviet people. In an extremely short period of historical time, the entire face of our country has been completely changed, forever shaking off the age-old backwardness inherited from the past.

    Comrade Stalin has led our people to obtain epoch-making socialist victories. Lenin's prediction has come true with miraculous power in our era—our communist economic construction has become a model for the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia!

    Lenin, with the eyes of his revolutionary genius, saw decades into the future. Lenin inextricably linked the victorious solution of international tasks with the victorious solution of our domestic tasks—maintaining the leading role of the proletariat over the peasantry, national industrialization, and guiding the peasantry onto the path of socialism based on the cooperative plan.

    The great strategist of the proletariat was able to see the clues to the development of the great historical process that emerged from the masses oppressed by imperialism. Decades ago, he had foreseen that hundreds of millions of fighters, one after another, would rise up to resist capitalist enslavement, resist its most ugly form—imperialism.

    Lenin pointed out that although the imperialist bourgeoisie "is prepared to maintain its precarious capitalist enslavement with all sorts of barbarous, brutal and criminal acts," the vast majority of the world's people are being drawn into the struggle for liberation at an extraordinary rate. Therefore, "the final victory of socialism is fully and absolutely guaranteed." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian Edition, Volume 27, page 417)

    Under the wise leadership of Comrade Stalin, the engineer of the collective farm system, our Party ensured the implementation of the Leninist peasant policy, successfully solving the most difficult task after the proletariat seized power—guiding millions of peasants onto the path of socialism, eliminating the most numerous exploiting class—the rich peasants, and ensuring the consolidation and development of the collective farm system on this basis.

    If our immortal father, the great Lenin, could see with his own eyes what achievements the Communist Party and the Soviet people have made in the past quarter of a century; if the great Lenin could see that in the vast land of our motherland, in the land where patriarchal rule and semi-slave system still dominated in 1921, there are already hundreds of thousands, even millions, of tractors, hundreds of first-class factories, power stations, mines and oil fields; if the great Lenin could see our thousands of most advanced Stakhanovite workers, our most advanced collective farm men and women peasants, thousands of glorious socialist labor heroes—their selfless creative work, setting an example of the highest labor productivity necessary for the gradual transition to communism. If the great Lenin could see on the land of our collective farms and state farms, delegations of farmers from the people's democratic countries numbering in the dozens and hundreds; if this were the case, Lenin would repeat with how proud a heart he felt for our Party and for our people, the prediction he made at the Eleventh Congress of the Party: "There is no force in the world, no matter how much disaster, difficulty and suffering it may cause to hundreds of millions of people, that can take away the main fruit of our revolution, because this is no longer 'our' fruit, but the fruit of world history." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian Edition, Volume 27, page 271)

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, under the wise guidance of Comrade Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's immortal cause, the Soviet people are following Lenin's legacy and advancing confidently towards communism.

    The Soviet people are commemorating the 26th anniversary of Lenin's death in a new upsurge in all aspects of socialist economy and culture. Today, the imperialist bloc believes that the Soviet Union, which suffered greater pain and losses during the Second World War than any other country, will not be able to cope with the difficulties of post-war economic recovery. The disillusionment of their inhuman desire is now undoubtedly confirmed by the world.

    The Soviet cities and villages, which were razed to the ground by the fascist barbarians, are rising from the scorched earth and ruins. Thanks to the heroic labor of Soviet patriots, the huge factories, power stations and mines that were destroyed by the Hitler gang have been rebuilt in an unprecedentedly short period of time. In the first four years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, our country built, repaired and put into operation 5,200 state-owned industrial enterprises. The progress of basic construction is so rapid that it is truly unprecedented in history! In the areas that were once occupied and destroyed by the enemy, the level of industrial production has returned to pre-war levels.

    The Stalin post-war Five-Year Plan is being completed ahead of schedule. Last year, the entire industry completed the expanded plan for 1949 with 103 percent. The total industrial output of the Soviet Union last year exceeded 41 percent of the pre-war 1940 level, while the general level of industrial production in the fourth quarter of 1949 exceeded 53 percent of the pre-war level. This is how the Soviet people completed the task put forward by Comrade Stalin in his historic speech to voters in February 1946—to restore the pre-war level of industrial and agricultural production, and to surpass this level by a considerable margin.

    The agricultural sector has also successfully completed the tasks of restoration and post-war development. There has been steady progress in solving the main task of agriculture at the present stage and implementing the three-year plan for developing animal husbandry. In 1951, the output of livestock products should increase by at least half compared with 1948. Millions of men and women collective farmers are working with great enthusiasm, demonstrating creative initiative in the Stalin plan to transform nature. The Stalin plan to transform nature is unprecedented in its scale. The completion of this plan guarantees bumper harvests every year, regardless of other factors, and is one of the decisive means of creating abundant consumer goods for our country. The time has come when the Soviet people are successfully transforming nature and conquering nature. Here, there are signs that the great communist era is approaching.

    The productivity of agriculture is constantly increasing with the help of socialist industry. Hundreds of thousands of tractors, combine harvesters, the latest agricultural machinery and powerful equipment for afforestation stations are converging into an increasingly strong torrent, rushing to agriculture. Due to the growth of technical equipment, the efficiency and level of socialist agriculture are getting higher and higher. Golden personnel who make up the capital of socialist agriculture have appeared and are growing. They are constantly improving their mastery of agricultural technology and agricultural science. In collective farm villages, the use of electrification, radio and film is developing on an increasingly large scale. In these villages, the construction of new houses is beginning to be carried out according to the urban policy. The age-old differences between city and countryside are being increasingly eradicated and eliminated, which is one of the main conditions for the gradual transition to communism.

    The victorious completion and surpassing of the national economic plan provides new and vivid evidence of the powerful, universal socialist competition to complete the Stalin post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, demonstrating the great energetic creativity of the socialist system and proving its superiority over the capitalist system. The fact that the Soviet social and state system is a superior form of social organization than any non-Soviet social system has been proven with new force and undeniable facts in the post-war period in front of the world.

    Stalin said in his speech at the All-Union Conference of Stakhanov Workers: "Our revolution is the only revolution that not only shattered the shackles of capitalism and gave the people freedom, but also created the material conditions for a prosperous life for the people. Herein lies the strength and invincibility of our revolution."

    In the Soviet Union, on the basis of the growth of the national economy, the purchasing power of the ruble is constantly increasing, and the real wages of workers, staff and intellectuals have increased. The income of peasants, from the common collective farm and from auxiliary individual operations, has increased. The cost of peasants buying industrial products is cheaper, and the prices of consumer goods are being systematically reduced. The material and cultural standards of the working people in urban and rural areas are improving. This is the essence of our socialist revolution, which is produced by the essence of the Soviet social and state system.

    At the reception of the participants in the May Day parade in 1935, Comrade Stalin said about himself and his comrades-in-arms: "As for us, the members of the Central Committee, the members of the government, we have no other life than to live for our great cause, to live for the universal welfare of the people, the happiness of all working people, the happiness of millions of people."

    No one in the world has contributed so much to this great cause—creating the universal happiness of the people and the happiness of all working people—as Lenin and Stalin.

    The Soviet people know that we will get closer and closer to the great goal set by the Party of Lenin and Stalin—building a communist society—year by year. In this society, the basis of social life will be this communist principle: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."

    Moreover, there is no force in the world that can stop the Soviet people from irresistibly advancing towards communism.

    II. Leninism—the Banner of the Struggle for Peace, Democracy and Socialism.

    The great doctrine of Leninism points out to the working people of all countries a road to struggle against the unprecedented disasters that imperialism has brought to mankind in the past and present. Leninism points out the true road to liberation from the shackles of imperialism and the road to building a new, socialist life.

    Marx saw the capitalist system as a system that seeks political madness in the economic poverty of the masses. The ruling class tries to find a way out of the capitalist crisis and contradictions in a new world war. The evil characteristics of the capitalist system that Marx pointed out are particularly prominent in the era of the general crisis of capitalism that began as a result of the First World War and the Great October Socialist Revolution.

    In the capitalist world, war and the arms race have never been so shamelessly and blatantly touted by war profiteers as the so-called panacea for curing the deadly diseases of capitalism, and as the "latest" method sufficient to restore the capitalist economy that is caught in insoluble contradictions.

    One can cite several statements by American monopoly magnates. The general idea of these statements is that true peace means disaster for them, because it will deprive them of large military orders.

    The magazine "U.S. News & World Report" revealed the views of "business people." The magazine bluntly said in April 1949 that the arms race plan is a very important new method of artificially supporting the economy.

    The so-called "adjusting the economy" policy currently pursued by the American ruling group, that is, the policy of artificially supporting the excessively inflated war industry, is the policy of fanatical rule of militarism, the policy of imperialism and war, and the policy of inciting the so-called "Cold War" and obstructing proposals aimed at consolidating peace and security among nations.

    As everyone knows, in the United States' 1950 budget, military spending accounted for 71 percent, while spending on public education and public health did not exceed 2 percent. From 1939 to 1950, U.S. military spending increased more than twenty times.

    However, these huge and ever-increasing military expenditures, the policy of artificially adapting the country to a war economy under conditions of peacetime, can only temporarily delay the inevitable and approaching economic crisis. At the same time, this policy further exacerbates all the contradictions of capitalism and creates the preconditions for the deepest and most destructive crisis.

    Military spending and "Cold War" spending cannot prevent the outbreak of economic crises in the United States and other capitalist countries. This has been proven by the facts. The fact is that although U.S. military spending in the autumn of 1948 reached its peak compared with the first few years after the war, it was precisely in the autumn of 1948 that the United States began a sharp economic decline. As everyone knows, the level of U.S. industrial production fell by 22 percent in one year from October 1948 to October 1949. Even according to the official figures reduced to a minimum, the number of unemployed increased by 64 percent this year. The total number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in the United States has exceeded 14 million, while the total number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in all capitalist countries is more than 40 million.

    The economies of European capitalist countries, shackled by the Marshall Plan and tied down by American "aid," are now in a state of deep and desperate chaos. Industrial production is decreasing, while unemployment and poverty are increasing. Inflation is increasing. Prices are soaring. The salaries of workers are being systematically cut. Small farmers and handicraftsmen are declaring bankruptcy. The sea of poverty and scarcity, the sea of tears of suffering of the working masses of capitalist countries, is getting deeper and deeper. In this case, the working people of Europe are particularly indignant at the murderous speeches of new war-mongers like British Field Marshal Montgomery. According to a report by Renault News, Montgomery recently said: A new war "will be a real holiday for us, and we will kill many people." It is by no means accidental that the democratic organizations of the working people of the Netherlands demanded that this vicious war profiteer leave Holland's Hague Amsterdam immediately. It would not be inappropriate to mention here that those who brazenly brag and plan to "celebrate" the new world war are precisely those British and American generals who panicked in the face of the offensive of twelve divisions of the Hitler army in January 1945, precisely those warriors who were rescued from disaster by the Soviet army launching a powerful offensive.

    Lenin, in answering questions from American journalists, predicted the historical inevitability of the collapse of imperialism that forced the people of all countries to engage in massacres. Lenin wrote: "The enormous progress of technology, especially the enormous progress of means of transportation, the amazing growth of capital in banks, has made capitalism mature and overripe. It has passed the period in which it should survive. It has become a reactionary obstacle hindering human progress. The collapse of capitalism is inevitable. ...The bourgeoisie, in the "best" case for themselves, can only delay the victory of socialism in this or that country at the cost of eliminating hundreds of thousands more workers and peasants. But they cannot save capitalism." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian Edition, Volume 24, page 404)

    The entire course of historical development has confirmed the wise scientific predictions of Lenin and Stalin, the great strategists of the proletariat, about the inevitability of the further development and aggravation of the general crisis of capitalism, and the inevitability of further revolutionary liberation from the capitalist system in some countries.

    The epoch-making victory of the socialist countries over fascist Germany and imperialist Japan in the Second World War, the establishment of people's democratic countries in several countries in Europe and Asia based on this victory, and the liberation of these countries from the capitalist system—all this is clear evidence of the further aggravation of the general crisis of capitalism, which is increasingly losing its past "stability." The rule of capitalism in colonial and semi-colonial countries is being increasingly undermined.

    The historical victory of the great Chinese revolution is a serious defeat for world imperialism.

    The brilliant predictions of Lenin and Stalin have become a reality. They have always pointed out that in China, the revolution is a great people's revolution, a revolution that, even if it suffers temporary setbacks and retreats, is invincible. It has enormous and immeasurable power.

    When talking about the heroic and victorious struggle of the Red Army against foreign interventionists and the White Guards, Lenin emphasized that the struggle and victory of the Red Army had great world significance. Lenin pointed out that the victory of the Red Army would explain to the people of all Eastern nations: "No matter how weak these nations are, no matter how invincible the power of the European oppressors (who use all the miracles of engineering and military art in the struggle) seems, the revolutionary war waged by the oppressed nations has such possibilities and such miracles that the liberation of the people of all Eastern nations is now completely achievable." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian Edition, Volume 24, page 544)

    When the Chinese revolution was at a difficult juncture, Comrade Stalin often filled the hearts of the Chinese Communists and the Chinese people with firm confidence in the victory of the revolution. When the imperialists attempted to brutally bombard Nanjing in 1927 in order to extinguish the Chinese revolution, Comrade Stalin said at that time: "...Only those who are as naive as children can imagine that the law of cannons is stronger than the law of history, can imagine that the bombardment of Nanjing can reverse the wheel of history.... The policy of intimidation has its "basis" in the history of imperialism. But, it is almost beyond doubt that this policy is unsuitable and will not achieve its purpose." (Stalin's Complete Works, Russian Edition, Volume 9, page 200)

    History has confirmed the predictions of Lenin and Stalin. This is proven by the great victory of the People's Republic of China, which was achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the heroic Communist Party of China and its glorious leader Mao Zedong.

    This has been proven by the collapse of the imperialists' China policy. Today, even the ideologues of American imperialism have to admit this collapse.

    In the book on the Asian situation written by Owen Lattimore, a former political advisor to Chiang Kai-shek, we can also find the following interesting confession. Lattimore wrote: Asia, which was easily and quickly conquered by conquerors in the 18th and 19th centuries, now shows an amazing ability to stubbornly resist armies equipped with new equipment such as airplanes, tanks, motor vehicles and field artillery. Previously, a small force could conquer large areas of land in Asia. The income obtained from looting, followed by direct taxes, trade, asset investment and long-term development, cleared the costs of military operations in an incredibly short period of time. This arithmetic was a great temptation for the powers. Lattimore pointed out: Now they have encountered another kind of arithmetic, which makes them discouraged. Indeed, no matter how the American imperialists calculate, this arithmetic is completely different from it. The American imperialist bosses spent 600 million US dollars instigating civil war in China and arming Chiang Kai-shek, just planning to be able to completely "extinguish communism" in China. At the same time, it established a vast base for aggression against the Soviet Union in China. However, the result was the complete victory of the great Chinese people's revolution and the general consolidation of the forces of the camp of peace, democracy and socialism.

    The camp of imperialism and war-mongers is extremely annoyed precisely because they have realized their internal weakness and the historical doom.

    The heads of imperialism are implementing the policy of continuing the "Cold War," the arms race, and launching a new world war. Because they are not sure of their internal strength, and harbor a fanatical illusion that through a new war, American and British imperialism can escape the maturing economic crisis and achieve world hegemony.

    But several factors have made the American and British imperialists' idea of being obsessed with world hegemony, which they learned from the Hitler gang, increasingly impossible to realize.

    The illusion of American atomic monopoly has been shattered. It has been determined that the Soviet Union, which leads the camp of peace and socialism, has possessed atomic weapons since 1947. The American intervention in China has been defeated miserably. The great victory of the Chinese people has shown that imperialism can no longer crush people's revolutions of the scale of the Chinese revolution with armed force.

    The forces advocating peace, democracy and socialism are developing and growing immeasurably. The political and economic forces of the people's democratic countries are growing, and the living conditions of the working people in these countries are constantly improving.

    A powerful movement advocating peace and opposing war profiteers has developed in several countries in Europe (France, Italy, and other countries). The German working people are increasingly deeply aware of the great historical significance of Comrade Stalin's words. These words are: "The parallel existence of a peace-loving democratic Germany and a peace-loving Soviet Union makes a new war in Europe impossible, ends the bloodshed in Europe, and makes it impossible for world imperialism to enslave European countries."

    An organized peace front, which includes not only the working people of the people's democratic countries, but also all progressive people in capitalist countries, has been successfully organized for the first time in history.

    The Soviet Union, in all its statements on international affairs, unswervingly upholds peace, and puts forward proposals against new war profiteers, and advocates the establishment of international cooperation and lasting peace.

    The great Stalinist peace strategy, starting from Lenin's legacy, is gaining more and more supporters. Lenin said about the struggle for peace that the Soviet Republic has always carried out: "We are waging the war for peace with special energy. This war has achieved brilliant results." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian Edition, Volume 25, page 102)

    Lenin pointed out: "Our entire policy and propaganda is absolutely not to drag the people into war, but to end the war." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian Edition, Volume 26, page 11)

    The Stalinist strategy of peace and security for all countries, relying on the long-term coexistence and peaceful competition of two systems, starts from the possibility of peaceful cooperation between the socialist and capitalist systems.

    Stalin said: "The idea of the cooperation of two systems was first expressed by Lenin. Lenin is our teacher, we Soviet people are Lenin's followers. We have never violated, and will never violate, Lenin's doctrine." The Stalinist foreign policy of the Soviet Union, which has always advocated peace and maintained the cause of peace, starts from these principles.

    Under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, the forces of peace are developing and growing stronger, and their vigilance and determination are increasing.

    Under the leadership of the fraternal Communist Parties, which are leading the way in the great struggle for peace, the working people of all countries are intensifying their opposition to the evil plans of the new war profiteers.

    The people of the world regard Comrade Stalin as the most stubborn, most determined and most wise fighter for peace. He does everything to crush the murderous plans of the new war profiteers. The people of the world regard Comrade Stalin as the great leader and teacher of the entire powerful camp of peace, democracy and socialism.

    III. The Party of Lenin and Stalin—the Leading and Guiding Force of Soviet Society.

    The glorious Party of Lenin and Stalin is the leading and guiding force of Soviet society, leading our people forward along the road to communism. All our successes are due to the great Communist Party, to the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, and to loyalty to Leninism.

    Lenin and Stalin taught that if the Party is not afraid of criticism and self-criticism, it is invincible.

    Comrade Stalin pointed out: "We need self-criticism as much as we need air, as much as we need water. Without self-criticism, our Party cannot move forward, cannot discover our weaknesses, and cannot eliminate our shortcomings."

    Comrade Stalin said: "The purity and clarity of this truth is as pure and clear as a spring."

    Comrade Stalin said: "Let the Party, let the Bolsheviks, let all our honest workers and working people expose the shortcomings in our activities and the shortcomings in our construction! Let them say the methods to eliminate our shortcomings, so that our activities and our construction will not stagnate and decay, so that all our activities, all our construction, will improve every day and achieve success one after another." (Stalin's Complete Works, Russian Edition, Volume 11, page 30)

    Comrade Stalin taught our cadres not to be arrogant, not to be satisfied with existing achievements, to properly evaluate achievements, while resolutely exposing shortcomings in work, sincerely treating criticism and self-criticism, correcting shortcomings, and steadily advancing to new victories.

    Comrade Stalin pointed out that anyone who cannot withstand the test of criticism and does not have the courage to accept criticism cannot move forward. We must summarize our work every day. We must ask ourselves: Can't I do better? Comrade Stalin pointed out that only in this case can we perfect our work and move forward.

    Complacency and arrogance, which cause stagnation in work, are contrary to the revolutionary and critical spirit of Bolshevism. Those who cannot withstand criticism and self-criticism, and who create an atmosphere that suffocates and obstructs criticism and self-criticism, destroy the enterprising spirit of Party organizations and bring bureaucracy into the life of Party and Soviet organizations, which is the Party's deadly enemy. The Party resolutely corrects those workers who have gone astray on this dangerous road, and the Party demands that criticism and self-criticism be developed bravely and fearlessly.

    Lenin and Stalin taught that if the Party can maintain and consolidate its ties with the broad masses of the people, it is invincible.

    Almost twenty years ago, Comrade Stalin wrote in his famous article "Reply to Collective Farm Comrades": "One of the reasons why the Communists have been able to gain honor in the struggle for socialism, and why the enemies of communism have been defeated, is that the Communists know how to absorb the best elements among the non-Party people for the cause, that they draw strength from the broad masses of non-Party people, that they know how to unite the broad non-Party activists around the Party." (Stalin's Complete Works, Russian Edition, Volume 12, page 227)

    Since then, the Party has demonstrated a brilliant example of implementing Lenin and Stalin's leadership over the masses, and its friendship and close ties with the people have been further strengthened.

    Lenin and Stalin pointed out that Communists should not only educate non-Party people, but also learn from them, listen carefully to the opinions of non-Party people, listen to the voices of the masses, and absorb, summarize and promote their creative experience and their initiative. The Party always remembers these instructions of its teachers and follows these instructions to constantly achieve new victories.

    The upcoming elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union will be held on the basis of the broadest socialist democracy, in an atmosphere of complete spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people. This election will further strengthen the ties between the Party of Lenin and Stalin and the broad masses of the people.

    The Party of Lenin and Stalin guides Soviet society towards communism, and makes all our economic and cultural construction subordinate to this great goal. During the period of completing socialist construction and gradually transitioning to communism, the communist education of the working people, the education of our personnel and all the people with Leninist ideas, and the cultivation and strengthening of life-giving Soviet patriotism—all this is of particular importance.

    Lenin's all-conquering ideas have been further creatively developed in Stalin's brilliant works, which constitute the theoretical summary of our country's great experience in building socialism, and the theoretical summary of the great experience of the international labor movement. The advanced representatives of the Soviet people and the working people of all countries have gained confidence from the works of Lenin and Stalin, firmly believing in the invincibility of the great cause of

    在列宁和斯大林不可战胜的伟大旗帜之下走向共产主义的胜利
    ——波斯伯洛夫在莫斯科列宁逝世二十六周年纪念大会上的报告
    【新华社北京二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十一日在莫斯科举行的列宁逝世二十六周年纪念大会上，波斯伯洛夫作报告，题为：在列宁和斯大林不可战胜的伟大旗帜之下走向共产主义的胜利。全文如下：
    同志们！从一九二四年一月二十一日乌拉第米尔·伊里奇·列宁，我们苏维埃革命之父、布尔什维克党和社会主义国家的缔造者、全世界劳动人民伟大的导师、领袖与朋友逝世的那个哀痛的日子，到现在已经二十六年了。
    列宁的名字是劳动人民和被剥削群众最心爱的名字。列宁永垂不朽的事业生存者，而且必将世世代代永远长存。我国人民和全体进步人类为一九一七年十月伟大的社会主义革命的成就而感激乌拉第米尔·伊里奇·列宁。这是他所准备的革命，这革命，揭开了世界历史的新纪元，即资本主义垮台和社会主义胜利的、构成人类真正历史之开端的纪元。
    列宁曾指出：“摧毁资本主义及其残余，建立共产主义秩序之基础，这便是现在已经开始了的世界历史新时代的内容。”（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十五卷，四百六十九页）
    乌拉第米尔·伊里奇·列宁创立并培养了久经战斗的共产党。在他的领导下，我国人民开始建设世界上第一个工农社会主义国家，并在帝国主义和白卫军的猛烈进攻中保卫了自己的苏维埃国家。列宁指示了在我国建设社会主义的伟大目标，并指出了达到这个目标的康庄大道。
    斯大林同志和列宁一道建党，一道领导伟大的十月社会主义革命，一道建立苏维埃国家。在内战和帝国主义干涉时期中，他和列宁一道指挥卫护社会主义祖国的保卫战，指导我国过渡到和平建设。列宁的事业已由他忠实的学生、朋友和战友斯大林同志所继续，并且现在还在继续进行着，这是我国和全体进步人类天大的幸运。斯大林同志以列宁主义的智慧来领导我国人民及全体进步人类，沿着被马列主义科学理论的光辉所照耀着的历史新道路，沿着亿万劳动人民斗争与胜利的道路前进。我们感谢斯大林同志，他神圣地执行列宁的争取社会主义伟大胜利的遗训，社会主义的伟大胜利对后世的命运是有真正的决定意义的。
    遵照着列宁的遗训，我国已在斯大林同志领导下建设了社会主义社会，而共产主义的建设也正在胜利发展。苏联已成为强有力的社会主义国家，已成为影响整个国际形势，并按照劳动人民的利益而使其根本改变的重要国际力量。从法西斯奴役之下拯救了欧洲各国人民和全世界人民的社会主义国度，各民族人民一律平等友好的国度，已成为和平、民主和社会主义的不可摧毁的堡垒。
    这就是为什么我国和全世界的劳动人民，以那样热爱的心情庆祝列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林同志七十寿辰的缘故。庆祝约瑟夫·维萨里昂诺维奇·斯大林七十大寿，变成了全体爱好和平人民、各国劳动人民团结与友谊的辉煌表示，这种表示在力量上是空前未有的。他们认为斯大林同志是他们所爱戴的导师和朋友，和平及人类走向自由与幸福的旗帜！
    一、苏维埃人民正在实现列宁的遗训，满怀信心地向共产主义迈进。
    我们党曾克服了难以致信的困难，以保证我国社会主义的胜利，把我们的祖国从技术上、经济上落后的国家，变成强有力的社会主义国家。列宁与斯大林的党，已领导我国人民走向社会主义的胜利，为社会主义与民主在欧洲与亚洲若干国家的历史性的胜利创造了决定的条件，这首先是因为它是马克思主义的党，列宁主义的党，是因为党的政策是以马列主义社会科学为基础的。列宁、斯大林的党在其一切活动中，在历史的暴风雨中，在曲折的历史道路中，过去是，现在也还是为天下无敌的马列主义学说的真正的南针所指导，而且马列主义的学说正为斯大林同志所发展和丰富着。
    马克思、恩格斯最先创造了科学的共产主义理论，他们科学地证明了，资本主义乃是历史上暂时的社会制度，证明了资产阶级灭亡和无产阶级夺取政权的必然性，社会主义代替资本主义的必然性。
    马克思和恩格斯教导工人阶级要意识到自己的力量，意识到它的资本主义制度掘墓人的伟大历史使命。马克思、恩格斯给予无产阶级以强有力的精神武器——革命理论。
    马克思、恩格斯曾和他们当时的劳工运动，和它的最先进的战士保持密切的联系。他们在革命的劳工运动中，在马克思的指导下成立的国际工人协会（按即第一国际）中，看到了新社会的前驱，看到了新的社会正在诞生，以代替旧的资本主义社会。“………和经济上贫困与政治上昏庸的旧社会相反的新社会正在诞生，它的国际法则将是和平，因为它的国家统治者不论在什么地方都是一样的——劳动者！”（马克思在国际工人协会常务委员会第一次宣言中论到普法战争时曾作过这样的预言）
    一九一七年十月在我国诞生的新的社会主义社会，建立了苏维埃政权，劳动人民的政权，而且使和平成为它的国际法则。这个社会业已证明我们不朽的导师列宁的话所具有的伟大的完全正确性。列宁说过：“社会主义本身就具有巨大的力量，并且人类现在已经进入了新的、并提供了非常光辉的前途的发展阶段”。（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十七卷，四一五页）
    马克思和恩格斯生活在这样的时代，那时资本主义还在向上发展，那时无产阶级革命还没有变成直接的实际的必然性。他们不可能看到资本主义制度的灭亡和新社会的诞生，他们却曾以科学的精确性预言新社会的诞生。
    列宁和斯大林在新时代即帝国主义与无产阶级革命时代的条件下，继承了马克思与恩格斯的事业。
    列宁发现了资本主义在帝国主义时代的发展规律，在这个时代它开始沿着下坡路发展，此时一度“繁荣的”资本主义变成了垂死的、腐朽的资本主义。列宁从理论上证明了社会主义在一个国家内胜利的可能性。
    在列宁与斯大林的领导下，第一次打破了世界帝国主义阵线的锁链，伟大的十月社会主义革命得到了胜利。
    列宁毕生献身于工人阶级的事业，献身于社会主义胜利的事业。列宁明晰而确实地预见了走向社会主义胜利的道路。他教导党和人民应该遵循什么道路去保证社会主义在我国以及在国际范围内取得胜利。
    在指出向社会主义前进的道路时，列宁明白地提出了我国工业化的任务，并警告说：没有工业化，一般地说我们独立国家的地位就会消灭。列宁主义的战略是以保持工人阶级对农民的领导，来保证大规模机器工业的恢复与发展，保证电气化计划的实现，并且在这个基础上实行对小农经济的社会主义改造。
    列宁曾预言：“……如果俄罗斯满布着电力站和高度技术工厂的密网，我们的共产主义经济建设便将成为将来社会主义的欧洲与亚洲的模范。”（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十六卷，四八页）
    斯大林同志在对列宁主义的敌人斗争中，坚持并发展了社会主义可能在一个国家内胜利的理论，把列宁主义的建设社会主义的战略计划（它的出发点是工业化的思想）具体化了。
    遵循列宁的遗训，斯大林同志以巨大的洞察力，在党和人民面前提供了迅速进行社会主义工业化的任务，为的是保持我们社会主义祖国的独立和保证社会主义的胜利。斯大林同志一九三一年二月在第一次全苏联社会主义工业工作人员代表会议上讲过：“我们比先进国家落后了五十以至一百年。我们应当在十年以内跑完这个距离。或者是我们能做到这一点，或者就是我们会被人打垮。”
    我国已经在有历史意义的期限内——斯大林同志所指定的期限内，完成了社会主义工业化的伟大事业。这就正是为什么在十年以后，在一九四一年希特勒德国以背信弃义的攻击来扑袭我国的时候，并不能压倒我们的原因。我们社会主义国度以其军事与工业经济的威力超过了有整个欧洲大陆的经济供其使用的希特勒德国。这个社会主义的国家在和法西斯主义的决死战中最后得到了胜利，它解放了欧洲的人民，使之脱出法西斯的奴役。
    苏维埃人民对于社会主义这个划时代的胜利，首先要感谢党与人民的伟大领袖与导师的英明领导，要感谢一切时代最伟大的战略家和统帅——斯大林同志。
    列宁与斯大林党以在我国建设社会主义的伟大计划鼓舞着群众，它击败了叛徒和投降者——这些人企图把孟什维克的不相信社会主义可能胜利的情绪，传染给党和人民，他们打算把我们的国家驱向资本主义复辟的歧途。所有这些孟什维克的随从——托洛斯基分子、季诺维也夫分子、布哈林分子、资产阶级民族主义者——从来就不是马克思主义者，他们只是“披着外衣”冒充马克思主义者而已。他们之所以采取叛变的立场，他们之所以变成资本主义包围的直接走狗，变成祖国的叛徒，其根本原因在于他们对幻想的资本主义制度“万能”，怀着最卑鄙肮脏的阿谀。
    列宁、斯大林主义的社会主义可能在我国胜利的理论，和群众紧紧结合之后，已成为强有力的物质力量。在几个斯大林五年计划中，这种力量已经在苏联人民英雄的劳动上表现出来。在极短促的一段历史时间中，我国的全部面目已幡然改观，永远摆脱了从过去继承过来的年代久远的落后状态。
    斯大林同志已领导我国人民获得了划时代的社会主义胜利。列宁的预言在我们的时代已经以奇迹般的力量见诸事实——我们的共产主义经济建设，已成为欧、亚两洲人民民主国家的模范！
    列宁以他革命天才的眼光，洞察到几十年的将来。列宁把胜利地解决国际范围的任务和胜利地解决我们的国内任务——保持无产阶级对农民的领导作用、国家工业化、以合作社计划为基础使农民转上社会主义的道路不可分离地联系起来。
    无产阶级的伟大战略家，能够看出巨大历史进程的发展的端倪，这种历史进程是从被帝国主义压迫的群众中显现出来的。在几十年前他就已预见到亿万前仆后继的斗士起来反抗资本主义的奴役，反抗其最丑恶的形式——帝国主义。
    列宁指出：虽然帝国主义资产阶级“准备用各种各样的野蛮，凶残与犯罪的行径来维持其岌岌可危的资本主义奴役”，然而地球上绝大多数人民，却正以一种不平常的速率，卷入争取解放的斗争中。因此，“社会主义的最后胜利是完全和绝对有保证的。”（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十七卷，四一七页）
    在集体农场制度的工程师斯大林同志英明的领导下，我们的党保证了列宁主义的农民政策的实现，成功地解决了无产阶级革命取得政权之后最艰难的任务——使千百万农民转上社会主义的道路，在这个基础上消灭人数最众多的剥削阶级——富农，保证着集体农场制度的巩固与发展。
    如果我们永垂不朽的父亲、伟大的列宁，能够亲眼看见共产党和苏联人民在过去四分之一世纪中获得了怎样的成就；如果伟大的列宁能够看到在我们祖国辽阔的土地上，在一九二一年仍然是家长统治与半奴隶制度占优势的土地上，已经有了成万以至几十万辆拖拉机，数以百计的头等工厂、电力站、矿山与油田；如果伟大的列宁能够看到我们数以千计的最先进的斯塔哈诺夫式工人、我们最先进的集体农场男女农民，数以千计的光荣的社会主义劳动英雄——他们无我的创造性的工作，树立了为逐渐过渡到共产主义所必需的最高度劳动生产率的范例。如果伟大的列宁能够看到我们的集体农场与国家农场的土地上，有各人民民主国家所派出的成打成百的农民代表团；如果是这样的话，列宁就会以对我党、对我国人民感到多么骄傲的心情，来重复他在党第十一届代表大会上所作的预言：“世界上没有一种力量，不论它可能对亿万人民造成怎么样大的灾祸、困难与痛苦，能够夺去我们革命的主要果实，因为这已不再是“我们”的果实，而是世界历史性的果实了。”（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十七卷，二七一页）
    在共产党领导下，在列宁不朽事业的伟大继承者斯大林同志的英明指导下，苏联人民正遵循列宁的遗训而充满信心地朝着共产主义迈进。
    苏联人民在社会主义经济与文化各方面的新的高涨中，纪念列宁逝世二十六周年。今天，帝国主义集团以为在第二次大战期间遭受的痛苦与损失比任何一国都要重大的苏联，将不能应付战后经济复兴的困难。他们这种仇视人类的想望的幻灭，现在已为全世界所确信不疑。
    曾被法西斯野蛮人夷为平地的苏联各城镇与乡村，正从焦土与废墟中屹立起来。由于苏联爱国者的英雄式的劳动，曾被希特勒匪帮破坏的庞大的工厂、电力站与矿山，业已在空前短促的时间内重新建立起来了。在战后五年计划的头四年内，我国新建、修复和开工生产的国营工业企业，有五千二百家。基本建设的进展这样神速，真是史无前例！在曾受到敌人占领破坏的地区中，工业生产水平已经回复到战前的水平了。
    斯大林战后五年计划正被提前完成。去年整个工业已以百分之一百零三完成了一九四九年度的扩大了的计划。苏联去年的工业总产量超过战前一九四零年百分之四十一，而一九四九年第四季的工业生产一般水平，则超出战前百分之五十三。这就是苏联人民怎样去完成斯大林同志一九四六年二月，对选民发表的历史性演说中所提出的任务——恢复战前工业与农业生产水平，而且要相当大地超过这个水平。
    农业部门也同样成功地完成了复兴与战后发展的各项任务。在解决现阶段农业的主要任务，履行发展牲畜业三年计划上，已有稳步发展。在一九五一年，牲畜产物的产量至少要比一九四八年增加一半。成百万的男女集体农民以巨大的热情工作着，在实现改造自然的斯大林计划中表现了创造的主动性。改造自然的斯大林计划在其规模上是史无前例的，这个计划的完成，保证年年丰收，而不受其他因素的影响，并且是为我国创造丰裕的消费品的决定性手段之一。苏联人民成功地改造自然，征服自然的时候已经来到了，在这里，有着伟大共产主义时代正在临近的征象。
    农业的生产力在社会主义工业的帮助下，正在不断增高。数以十万计的拖拉机、康拜因机、最新式的农业机器和供造林站使用的强有力的装备，正汇合成越来越壮大的洪流，奔向农业。由于技术设备的增长，社会主义农业的效率和水平越来越高。构成社会主义农业的资本的黄金般的人员，已经出现而且正在成长。他们不断改进他们对于农业技术和农业科学的掌握。在集体农庄的乡村，电气化无线电和电影的使用，正以越来越大的规模在发展着。在这些乡村，新房屋的建筑正开始按城市的方针来进行。年代悠久的城市与乡村间的差别，正越来越被根绝和消除，这是逐渐过渡到共产主义的主要条件之一。
    国民经济计划的胜利完成与超过，为提前完成斯大林战后五年计划的强大普遍的社会主义竞赛，提供了新的生动的证据，证明社会主义制度的伟大的精力饱满的创造力，证明它胜过资本主义制度的优越性。苏维埃社会与国家制度是比任何非苏维埃社会制度为优的社会组织形式，这一事实在战后时期在全世界面前，以新的力量和无可辩驳的事实得到证明。
    斯大林在全苏联斯塔哈诺夫工作者会议上的演讲中说：“我们的革命是唯一的一个革命，不仅粉碎了资本主义的枷锁和给了人民以自由，而且为人民创造了富裕生活的物质条件。我们的革命的力量和不可征服性就在这里。”
    在苏联，在国民经济增长的基础上，卢布的购买力不断增高，工人、职员知识分子的实际工资已经提高。农民的收入，从共有的集体农庄方面的和从辅助的个人经营方面的收入，都增加了。农民购买工业品的费用便宜了，消费品的价格正被有系统地减低。城乡劳动人民的物质和文化水准，在提高着。这是我们社会主义革命的实质，苏维埃社会与国家制度的实质所产生的。
    在一九三五年五一节检阅参加者的招待会上，斯大林同志谈到他自己和他的战友说：“至于我们，中央委员会的委员们，政府委员们，除了为我们的伟大事业而生活，为了争取人民的普遍福利，全体劳动人民的幸福，千百万群众的幸福而生活之外，别无其他生活。”
    世界上没有谁像列宁和斯大林一样，对这个伟大的事业——创造人民的普遍幸福和全体劳动群众的幸福——作出了这么多的贡献。
    苏联人民知道：我们将一年比一年地越来越走近列宁及斯大林党所树立的伟大目标：建立共产主义社会。在这个社会中，社会生活的基础将是这一共产主义原则：“各尽所能，各取所需。”
    而且，世界上没有任何一种力量能够阻止苏联人民不可抗拒地向共产主义迈进。
    二、列宁主义—争取和平、民主与社会主义的斗争的旗帜。
    列宁主义的伟大学说，向一切国家的劳动人民，指出了一条与帝国主义过去和现在给人类带来的空前灾祸作斗争的道路。列宁主义指出了从帝国主义羁绊下求解放的真正道路，建设新的、社会主义生活的道路。
    马克思把资本主义制度看作是群众经济贫困中寻求摆政治疯狂的一个制度。统治阶级力图在新的世界大战脱资本主义危机与矛盾的出路。马克思所这样指出的资本主义制度的罪恶特点，在作为第一次世界大战及伟大十月社会主义革命的结果而开始的资本主义总危机时代，以特别的力量突现出来。
    在资本主义世界中，战争和军备竞赛从来没有被战争贩子这样厚颜无耻、这样露骨地鼓吹为所谓医治资本主义死症的万灵膏，鼓吹为足以恢复那陷于不可解决之矛盾中的资本主义经济的“最新的”方法。
    人们可以援引美国垄断大王的若干言论。这些言论的大意就是：对他们来说，真正的和平意味着灾难，因为将使他们丧失大宗的军备定单。
    《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志透露了“企业界人士”的观点。该杂志在一九四九年四月曾露骨地说：军备竞赛计划乃是人为地支撑经济的一个非常重要的新方法。
    美国统治集团现正奉行的所谓“调节经济”的政策，即人为地支持过分膨胀的战争工业的政策，就是军国主义的狂热统治的政策，就是帝国主义和战争的政策，就是煽动所谓“冷战”和阻挠以巩固和平及各国间安全为目的之建议的政策。
    大家知道，在美国一九五○年度的预算中，军费占百分之七十一，而公共教育与公共卫生的费用，不超过百分之二。从一九三九年到一九五○年，美国的军费增加了二十余倍。
    但是，这些庞大的、且不断增加的军备开支，在和平时期的条件下，人为地使国家适合于战争经济的方针，只能暂时延缓无可避免的和日益接近的经济危机。同时这个方针却更进一步地加剧了资本主义的一切矛盾，为最深重与最有破坏作用的危机创造先决条件。
    军费与“冷战”的开支，并不能阻止经济危机在美国及其他资本主义国家爆发。这一点已为事实所说明。事实是：虽然美国在一九四八年秋季的军费，与战后开头数年相较，达到了最高峰，可是恰恰就是在那一九四八年秋季，美国开始了急剧的经济下降。大家知道，美国工业产量水平，自一九四八年十月到一九四九年十月一年中，下降了百分之二十二。即使是根据缩小到最低限度的官方数字，这一年的失业人数也增加了百分之六十四。美国失业与半失业的总人数已超过一千四百万人，而全体资本主义国家失业与半失业的总人数，则为四千余万人。
    欧洲资本主义各国的经济在马歇尔计划的桎梏下，受到美国“援助”的羁绊，现在正处于深深的与绝望的混乱状态中。工业生产正在减少，而失业与贫困则在增长。通货膨胀正在增大。物价正在高涨。职工的薪资正被有系统地削减。小农与手工业者宣告破产。贫困与匮乏的苦海、资本主义各国劳动群众受苦受难的眼泪之海，越来越深。在这种情况下，欧洲的劳动人民对于像英国陆军元帅蒙哥马利之流新战争挑拨者的杀气腾腾的演说，就特别感到愤慨。据雷诺新闻所报道，蒙哥马利最近曾说：新战争“对于我们将是真正的节日，并且我们将杀死许多人”。荷兰劳动人民的民主组织，要求这位凶恶的战争贩子立即离开荷京阿姆斯特丹，这决不是偶然的。这里提一提这样一件事，不会是不适当的，即：那些无礼地大吹大擂、并且打算“庆祝”新世界大战的人，正是那些在一九四五年一月在希特勒军的十二个师攻势面前惊慌失措的英美将军们，正是那些由于发动强大攻势的苏军才从灾难中被拯救出来的勇士们。
    列宁在答复美国记者的问题时，曾预言强使各国人民进行屠杀的帝国主义的崩溃之历史必然性。列宁写道：“技术的巨大进步，特别是交通工具的巨大进步，银行中资本的惊人增长，已使资本主义成熟而且过熟了。它已过了它应该生存的时期。它已变成妨碍人类进步的反动障碍。资本主义的崩溃是不可避免的。………资产阶级在对他们自己“最好”的情况下，也只能以再消灭数十万工人与农民为代价，在这一国家或另一国家拖延社会主义的胜利。但是他们却拯救不了资本主义。”（列宁全集俄文版第二十四卷，四○四页）
    历史发展的全部进程，证实了无产阶级伟大战略家列宁及斯大林关于资本主义总危机进一步发展与加剧之必然性，以及若干国家进一步以革命方式摆脱资本主义制度之必然性的英明的科学预见。
    社会主义国家在第二次世界大战中对法西斯德国及帝国主义日本的划时代的胜利，在欧亚两洲若干国家中以这一胜利为基础的人民民主国家的建立，这些国家的摆脱资本主义制度——所有这一切，就是那正在越来越丧失其以往的“稳定”的资本主义总危机进一步加剧的明证。资本主义在殖民地及半殖民地国家中的统治，正越来越受到破坏。
    伟大中国革命的历史性胜利，是世界帝国主义的严重失败。
    列宁及斯大林的光辉的预见已成为现实了。他们曾经常指出：在中国，革命是伟大的人民革命，这一革命纵然遭受到暂时的挫折与后退，但却是不可战胜的。它具有巨大的和不可估量的力量。
    谈到红军对外国干涉军及白卫军的英勇的胜利斗争时，列宁曾强调说过：红军的斗争与胜利具有巨大的世界意义。列宁曾指出，红军的胜利将会向东方各民族人民说明：“不管这些民族是怎样的羸弱，不管欧洲压迫者（他们在斗争中采用工程学的一切奇迹与军事的艺术）的力量似乎不可战胜，但是，被压迫民族所进行的革命战争，却具有这样的可能性和这样的奇迹，即东方各民族人民的解放现在是完全可以实现的了。”（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十四卷五四四页）
    当中国革命处在困难的关头，斯大林同志曾经常使中国共产党人和中国人民心中，充满着对革命胜利的坚定信念。当帝国主义者在一九二七年试图惨无人道地炮轰南京，以扑灭中国革命的时候，斯大林同志那时就说过：“……只有那些像小孩子一样幼稚的人，才能这样设，想以为大炮的法则比历史的法则强大，才能这样设想，以为炮轰南京可以扭转历史的车轮……。恫吓的政策在帝国主义历史上是有它的“根据”的。但是，几乎无可怀疑，这一政策是不适合的，是达不到它的目的的。”（斯大林全集，俄文版，第九卷，二○○页）
    历史证实了列宁和斯大林的预言。中国人民在英勇的中国共产党及其光荣的领袖毛泽东领导之下，所获得的中华人民共和国的伟大胜利，就证明了这一点。
    这已由帝国主义者对华政策的崩溃得到了证明。今天，就是美国帝国主义的思想家，也不得不承认这个崩溃了。
    在蒋介石前政治顾问拉铁摩尔所著关于亚洲情势一书内，我们也可发现下列有趣味的招供。拉铁摩尔写道：在十八和十九世纪，为征服者轻易而迅速征服的亚洲，现在显示出可惊的能力，顽强地抗拒着有飞机、坦克、摩托车辆及野战炮等新式装备的军队，以前在亚洲只要以少数兵力就可以征服大片领土。以抢掠为主，继之以直接税、贸易、资产投资和长期开发所获得的收入，在令人难以置信的短期内，便偿清了军事行动的费用。这种算术对于列强是一个大诱惑。拉铁摩尔指出：现在他们碰上了另外一种算术，这种算术使他们灰心丧气了。的确，无论美国帝国主义者的算盘怎样打，这个算术也是与它完全不同了。美国帝国主义的老板们，用了六十万万美元在中国煽动内战，并武装蒋介石，就是打算能够在中国彻底地“扑灭共产主义。”同时在中国建立起辽阔的侵苏基地。然而，其结果却是伟大中国人民革命的完全胜利及和平民主与社会主义阵营的力量的普遍巩固。
    帝国主义和战争挑拨者阵营之所以恼怒万分，正是因为他们已经觉察到内部的虚弱和历史注定的末日。
    帝国主义头子们实行继续“冷战”的政策、军备竞赛与发动新的世界大战的政策。因为他们不确信他们内部的力量，并存有一种狂热的幻想，即经由新的战争，美英帝国主义或可逃避正在成熟的经济危机，而达到独霸世界。
    但有若干因素已使美英帝国主义者自希特勒匪帮那里学来的醉心于独霸世界的念头，越来越不能实现了。
    美国原子垄断的幻想，已告破灭。已经确定的是：领导和平与社会主义阵营的苏联，自一九四七年以来就拥有原子武器。美国对中国的干涉已遭惨败。中国人民的伟大胜利已表示出：帝国主义已不再能以武装力量来粉碎像中国革命那种规模的人民革命了。
    主张和平、民主与社会主义的力量，不可衡量地发展壮大着。人民民主国家的政治和经济力量正在增长着，而且这些国家中劳动人民的境况正在不断改进着。
    拥护和平与反对战争贩子的强大的运动，已在欧洲若干国家（法国、意大利、及其他国家）发展起来了。德国劳动人民愈来愈深刻地认识到斯大林同志一段话的伟大历史意义。这段话就是：“爱好和平的民主的德国与爱好和平的苏联之并肩存在，使得欧洲不再有新战争的可能，结束欧洲的流血，并使世界帝国主义奴役欧洲国家成为不可能。”
    不仅包括人民民主国家的劳动人民，而且也包括资本主义国家的一切进步人民在内的有组织的和平阵线，在历史上首次组织成功了。
    苏联在它发表有关国际方面的一切声明中，不屈不挠地维护和平，提出了反对新战争挑拨者，和主张建立国际合作与持久和平的建议。
    从列宁的遗训出发的伟大斯大林主义的和平战略，正获得越来越多的拥护者。列宁曾述及苏维埃共和国所始终进行的争取和平的斗争，他说：“我们以特别的精力来进行争取和平的战争。这个战争得到了辉煌的成果。”（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十五卷，一零二页）
    列宁指出：“我们的全部政策与宣传，绝不是要把人民拖入战争，而是结束战争。”（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十六卷，一一页）
    斯大林主义的各国和平与安全的战略，寄托于两个制度的长期共存与和平竞赛，它是从社会主义与资本主义制度间和平合作的可能性出发的。
    斯大林说：“两个制度的合作的观念，是由列宁首次表示出来的。列宁是我们的导师，我们苏联人民是列宁的信徒。我们过去绝未违背，而且将来也绝不违背列宁的学说。”一向主张和平与维护和平事业的苏联斯大林主义的外交政策就是从这些原则出发的。
    在列宁和斯大林的旗帜下，和平的力量正在发展壮大中，他们的警觉与决心正在增强。
    在争取和平的伟大斗争中领头前进的各兄弟共产党领导下，各国劳动人民正在加紧反对新战争挑拨者的罪恶计划。
    全世界的人民把斯大林同志看成一个最倔强、最坚决和最英明的争取和平的斗士。他做出一切事情来粉碎新战争挑拨者的杀气腾腾的计划，全世界的人民把斯大林同志看作整个强大的和平、民主与社会主义阵营的伟大领袖与导师。
    三、列宁及斯大林党—苏维埃社会的领导与指导力量。
    列宁与斯大林的光荣的党，是苏维埃社会的领导与指导力量，领导我国人民沿着走向共产主义的道路前进。我们的一切成功都应归功于伟大的共产党，归功于列宁斯大林的领导，归功于对列宁主义的忠诚。
    列宁与斯大林教导说：如果党不害怕批评与自我批评，那它是不可战胜的。
    斯大林同志指出：“我们需要自我批评，就像需要空气，需要水一样。没有自我批评，我们党就不能前进，就不能发现我们的弱点，就不能消除我们的缺点。”
    斯大林同志说：“这个真理的纯净和晶莹，就像泉水是纯净晶莹一样。”
    斯大林同志说：“让党、让布尔什维克党人、让我国全体正直的工人和劳动人民，揭露我们活动中的缺点和我们建设中的缺点吧！让他们说出消灭我们缺点的方法，以便使我们的活动和我们的建设，不会有停滞和腐朽，以便使我们一切活动，我们全部建设，天天都有改进，一个接着一个地取得成就。”（斯大林全集，俄文版，第十一卷，三○页）
    斯大林同志教导我们的干部不要自负，不要满足于已有的成就，适当地估价成就，而同时坚决地揭露工作中的缺点，诚恳地对待批评与自我批评，纠正缺点并稳步地向新的胜利前进。
    斯大林同志指出：任何经不起批评考验，和没有勇气接受批评的人，是不能够前进的。必须每天总结自己的工作。必需反躬自问：我不能再做得更好一些吗？斯大林同志指出：只有在这样的情况下，我们才能使我们的工作臻于完善，并向前迈进。
    使工作发生停滞现象的自满和自负，是和布尔什维克主义的革命的与批判的精神相违背的。经不起批评与自我批评的、创造一种窒息和阻塞批评与自我批评的气氛的人，破坏党组织的进取性，把官僚习气带进党和苏维埃组织的生活中来，而这种习气是党的死对头。党坚决地纠正那些误入这种危险道路的工作人员，党要求勇敢而无畏地发展批评与自我批评。
    列宁和斯大林教导说：如果党能够保持并巩固它与广大人民群众的联系，那末它就是不可战胜的。
    几乎在二十年以前，斯大林同志就在他的名著《给集体农场同志们的答复》一文中写道：“共产党人在为社会主义的斗争中所以能够得到荣誉，共产主义的敌人所以被击败，其原因之一，就是在于共产党人知道如何为事业而吸收非党人民中的优秀分子，就是在于他们从广大非党人民中吸取力量，在于他们知道如何把广大的非党积极分子团结在党的周围”。（斯大林全集，俄文版，第十二卷，二二七页）
    从那时候起，党表现了对群众实行列宁和斯大林主义的领导的光辉范例，它与人民的友谊和亲密的联系，更加增强了。
    列宁和斯大林指出，共产党人不仅应当教育非党人民，而且应当向他们学习，应当注意地倾听非党人民的意见，倾听群众的呼声，吸取、综合和推广他们的创造性的经验和他们的主动性。党始终记着它的导师的这些指示，并遵循这些指示经常取得新的胜利。
    即将到来的苏联最高苏维埃选举，将在最广泛的社会主义民主的基础上举行，在苏联人民的精神上和政治上的完全团结的气氛中举行。这一选举，将更加加强列宁和斯大林的党与广大人民群众的联系。
    列宁和斯大林的党引导苏维埃社会迈向共产主义，使我们全部经济和文化的建设，都从属于这个伟大的目标。在完成社会主义建设及逐渐过渡到共产主义的时期中，对劳动人民进行的共产主义的教育，以列宁主义的思想对我们的人员及全体人民进行教育，培养和加强赋予生命力的苏维埃爱国主义——这一切便具有特别的重要性。
    列宁的战胜一切的思想，在斯大林的光辉的著作里得到了进一步的创造性的发挥，这些著作构成我国建设社会主义的伟大经验的理论总结，及国际劳工运动的伟大经验的理论总结。苏联人民及各国劳苦人民的进步代表，从列宁及斯大林的著作中得到了信心，坚信列宁和斯大林的伟大事业的不可战胜，坚信自己的力量，坚信共产主义的必然胜利；他们把这些著作当作行动的指针。在苏维埃时代，马、恩、列、斯的著作在我国共发行了七亿八千八百万册。
    我们的列宁和斯大林的伟大的党，由于它的忠于列宁主义，而日益强大和不可战胜，并空前紧密地团结在它的中央委员会的周围，团结在指引我们走向新的胜利的党的光辉导师与领袖斯大林同志的周围！
    同志们！列宁所曾想望和预言过的世界历史进行的急剧发展的时代，已经成为现实，我们今天就生活在这样的时代。
    用马克思著作的话说，让旧世界的疯狂的走狗和猪猡，用幻想来安慰他们自己吧！他们幻想他们能在其仆从——右翼社会党人及其他叛徒——的帮助下，保持住那注定了要死亡的资本主义奴役的世界！
    历史是欺骗不了的，也开不了倒车。历史的法则也不能用任何武力的法则来代替，如像新战争挑拨者所梦想的那样。无可逃避的毁灭在等待着他们。伟大斯大林的时代，社会主义胜利和建设共产主义的时代，带给人类以非常灿烂的机会，去提高生产力，过幸福而愉快的生活。
    列宁和斯大林的伟大而不可战胜的旗帜万岁！我们英勇的列宁和斯大林的党万岁！伟大的苏联人民万岁！全世界争取和平斗士万岁！我们敬爱的领袖、父亲和导师、领导苏联人民走向共产主义胜利的人类的光辉天才斯大林同志万岁！
