    Several Explanations Regarding "Technical Norms"
    Central People's Government Ministry of Heavy Industry

    "Technical Norms" are a new Soviet industrial management method that has just begun to be implemented in Northeast China. It is currently in the exploratory and experimental stage. The following explanations are based on available information and are for your reference:
            (I) What are technical norms? What do they include?
    Technical norms are a type of technical standard formulated by production units based on scientific and rational principles. This standard falls between the new records achieved by advanced producers and the existing technical standards and is achievable by general workers under normal, active working conditions. This standard will remain unchanged for a certain period. During this period, those who exceed the standard will receive a certain material reward based on the amount they exceed. Its specific content includes mechanical efficiency, labor allocation, production methods, quality standards, and raw material consumption. For example, if we have a 150-horsepower steel rolling mill for rolling steel, we must determine the standard efficiency of the machine, specify what kind of materials, through what procedures, how long it takes to roll a material, the monthly output, how many workers are needed for various operations, what quality standards must be met, and how much raw materials, coal, water, and electricity are required to produce one ton of finished products. With technical norms, we can create accurate production plans and compare the true achievements of various production units.
            (II) What subjective and objective conditions must be met to implement technical norms?
    The conditions for implementing technical norms include the following:
    (1) Workers' production enthusiasm has reached a certain level.
    (2) There must be a certain production task.
    (3) There must be sufficient raw materials.
    (4) Production equipment must be fixed.
    (5) Some necessary systems must be established—such as the reporting system for engineering management, the material receiving and dispatching system, and the warehouse management system (and a thorough inventory must be conducted first).
            (III) What are the specific steps for implementing technical norms?
    According to the "Instructions on Further Organizing and Promoting the New Record Movement" issued by the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government, "The determination of reasonable norms generally involves three steps:
    First, fully mobilize the masses to create new records in all aspects, establish a systematic and thorough statistical work, and organize cadres to conduct technical calibration on-site. Leading cadres should also personally participate in the calibration in the subjective aspects, accurately measure the efficiency of machinery and equipment and labor efficiency, and test the standard consumption of various product qualities and raw materials as an important basis for determining reasonable norms. When the movement develops to a certain stage, the factory management committee should study the norms.
    Second, before deciding on various norms, the results of the factory management committee's research should be handed over to that group for democratic discussion, and the trade union and branch should first deliberate and mobilize to discuss whether the various norms are reasonable, dispel workers' concerns about the implementation of quota management, and make completing and exceeding the norms a conscious action for all workers.
    Third, after discussion by relevant employees and approval by the factory management committee, it will be implemented after approval by the bureau (company) level. The technical norms for the entire factory and company that will be implemented starting next January must be approved by the Ministry of Industry. This new technical norm approved by the Ministry of Industry should remain unchanged for half a year."

    关于“技术定额”的几点解释
    中央人民政府重工业部
    “技术定额”是苏联新的工业管理方法，在我国东北刚开始推行，目前尚在探求与摸索阶段，仅就现有资料解释如下，供大家参考：
            （一）什么是技术定额？包括那些内容？
    技术定额是在生产单位根据科学合理的原则，制定的一种技术标准。这种标准是介乎先进生产者所达到的新纪录与现在自然存在的技术标准之间，而为一般职工在正常的积极工作条件下都能达到的标准。这种标准，将规定在一定期间内不变。在此期间内，超过标准的、按其超过数量给予一定的物质奖励。它的具体内容包括有机械效率、劳动配备、生产方法、质量标准及原材料消耗等，例如我们有１５０马力轧钢机一座，用以压延钢材则我们须确定该机的标准效率，规定何种材料，经过如何程序，压延一根材料所要时间，一月生产量为多少，各种作业人员须配备多少，质量须含何种标准，生产一吨成品须多少原料、煤炭、水及电力等，有了技术定额，我们才可以制出正确的生产计划及比较各生产单位的真实成绩。
            （二）实行技术定额，应具备那些主观及客观条件？
    实行技术定额应具备的条件约有下列数点：
    （一）工人生产热忱，达到了一定程度。
    （二）须有一定生产任务。
    （三）应有充足原材料。
    （四）生产设备要固定。
    （五）须建立起一些必要的制度——如工务管理的表报制度、材料收发制度、仓库的管理制度（且须先作清查）等。
            （三）实行技术定额的具体步骤如何？
    根据东北人民政府工业部所发“进一步组织和推广新纪录运动指示”中所言“合理定额的确定一般的应经过三个步骤：
    一、充分的发动群众创造各方面的新纪录，建立系统周密的统计工作并组织干部到现场进行技术标定，领导干部也要在主观环节上亲自参加标定，准确的测定机器设备的效率和劳动效率，试用各种产品质量和原材料的标准用量，以作为确定合理定额的重要根据，运动发展到一定阶段，工厂管理委员会即应研究定额。
    二、在决定各种定额之前，应将工厂管理委员会研究的结果，交给那个小组民主讨论，并事先经过工会与支部酝酿动员，讨论各种定额是否合理，打消工友对实行定额管理的顾虑，使完成与超过定额成为全体工友自觉的行动。
    三、经过有关职工讨论，工厂管理委员会通过以后，再由局（公司）一级批准实行，明年一月开始实行的全厂全公司的技术定额，最后须经工业部批准，经工业部批准的这个新的技术定额，应该是半年不变动。”
