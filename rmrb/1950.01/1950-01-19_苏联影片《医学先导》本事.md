    Synopsis of the Soviet Film "Pirogov"
    "Pirogov" is a historical film depicting the life and deeds of the great medical scientist Nikolai Ivanovich Pirogov, produced by the Lenfilm Studio. The director, Grigori Kozintsev, and the actor who plays Pirogov, the People's Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Sergei Gorobchenko, both won Stalin Prizes.
    In the Soviet Union, this film has been dubbed into Taks and Armenian languages; the version screened in China has Chinese subtitles. The synopsis of the film is as follows:
    The film opens with the great physician Pirogov being hired as a professor at the Medical Academy in St. Petersburg. As his carriage arrives in the suburbs of St. Petersburg, a sick person collapses and dies by the roadside. Pirogov gets out of the carriage to examine the body and learns that St. Petersburg is experiencing an epidemic – cholera. He rushes to the Medical Academy and immediately assembles his students to participate in the work of eradicating cholera. He instructs his students: "As doctors, you must swear to serve the people!"
    The hospital supervisor is jealous of Dr. Pirogov and slanders him to the court physician, who holds the highest medical authority in the country, saying that he is a materialist and has a bad influence on young people. Therefore, the court physician prepares to sabotage Dr. Pirogov's work at the first opportunity.
    While Dr. Pirogov is organizing students to participate in rescuing patients, a teaching assistant at the hospital, Skuratov, becomes his good helper. At this time, an orphan girl, Bakulina, whose parents died of the epidemic, requests to join the service of rescuing patients. In that society, women were still discriminated against; however, Dr. Pirogov agrees to her request, saying, "You will be the first female nurse in Russia!"
    In St. Petersburg, there is a famous wealthy man named Lyadov, who indulges in extravagance and has contracted an incurable disease in his leg. One day, the rich man is introduced to Dr. Pirogov by another doctor, Ippolitov, and asks Dr. Pirogov for treatment. Dr. Pirogov believes that surgery should be performed to remove the affected part, but the rich man does not listen to Dr. Pirogov's advice and continues his extravagant lifestyle. When Dr. Pirogov returns to the hospital, the court physician arrives and intends to prohibit Dr. Pirogov's work, saying that he does not follow the old methods recognized in Europe. But Dr. Pirogov says with confidence: "Europe often recognizes many quacks as true scientists, and we cannot accept everything indiscriminately." After speaking, he leaves and continues to treat patients with new methods. As a result, the epidemic in the entire city is eradicated by him and his students.
    After the epidemic is eradicated, Dr. Pirogov, Skuratov, and Bakulina go to the suburbs for a vacation. Skuratov and Bakulina's love matures. When they are in high spirits, Dr. Ippolitov rushes from the city to find Dr. Pirogov, saying that the rich man Lyadov's leg disease has become serious and requests Dr. Pirogov to treat him. If he cures the disease, the rich man is willing to donate a large sum of money to build a medical school. Dr. Pirogov then returns with Dr. Ippolitov. On the way, Dr. Ippolitov advises Dr. Pirogov to enjoy life while he can, saying, "People are bound to die, and after death, others will forget your contributions." But Dr. Pirogov says, "I believe that the motherland will never forget me!" Dr. Ippolitov also advises him to go abroad because foreign countries value him more. But Dr. Pirogov says, "It is not glorious for scientists to leave their motherland." They walk to a prosperous road and see a crowd of tourists. Dr. Ippolitov says, "You take human happiness lightly. Look at how happy people live!" But Dr. Pirogov says, "Is this the meaning of life? You have not recognized true happiness!" Then, he points out, "People who are working are the happiest!"
    In the rich man's home, Lyadov is dying, and all the doctors are helpless. The court physician, of course, proposes a set of mysterious and absurd medical techniques using the essence of the stars. After examining the patient, Dr. Pirogov believes that they have been misled by these incompetent doctors and strongly rebukes the court physician and others. From then on, the court physician and the hospital supervisor harbor even more resentment in their hearts.
    The rich man Lyadov finally dies. To prove that his treatment method is correct, Dr. Pirogov is willing to have other doctors observe a surgical operation he is about to perform on a soldier he is treating. Thus, the reactionary group has an opportunity to sabotage. On the day of the public surgery, the reactionary court physician secretly instructs a special agent to arrest Dr. Pirogov's assistant, Skuratov, on his way back to the hospital to retrieve the anesthetic. At the time, Dr. Pirogov has no choice but to use the court physician's fake anesthetic. During the surgery, the patient almost dies, but Dr. Pirogov is alert, and the soldier's physique is also very good, so he overcomes the danger. All the spectators admire Dr. Pirogov's medical skills.
    Soon, the flames of war spread throughout Russia, and Skuratov is released from prison and joins the war. Dr. Pirogov and Bakulina and his group of students also go to the front line to serve. On the battlefield, Skuratov is injured. When he is carried to the medical area, he hears a very familiar voice, which turns out to be his long-separated fiancée Bakulina. They meet on the battlefield and are even more affectionate. Although Skuratov's leg is injured, he will not be disabled with the comfort of his lover and the treatment of Dr. Pirogov.

    苏联影片《医学先导》本事
    《医学先导》是描述伟大医学家比罗果夫的生活和事迹的历史片，苏联列宁制片厂出品。导演柯静切夫和饰比罗果夫的俄罗斯苏维埃共和国人民艺术家戈罗鲍迦多夫，均曾荣获斯大林奖金。
    在苏联，此片已配成塔克斯语和阿美尼亚语；在中国放映的，配有中文字幕。该片本事如下：
    开幕时，大医师比罗果夫受聘于彼得堡的医学院为教授。马车行抵彼得堡郊外，路旁有病者倒地而死。比罗果夫下车诊治，知彼得堡正流行一种时症——霍乱，于是赶赴医学院，马上召集学生参加扑灭霍乱的工作。并训诫学生：“做医生，要宣誓为人民服务！”
    医院监督嫉视比医师，便向当时执有全国医药权威的御医诽谤他，并说他是个唯物主义者，对青年有不良的影响。于是御医准备一有机会便破坏比医师的工作。
    比医师在组织学生参加救护病人的工作中，医院的一个助教斯库拉成是他的好助手。是时一个父母死于疫症的孤女巴库林娜，要求参加救护病人的服务。在当时的社会里，女子仍然是被歧视的；但是，比医师答应了她的要求，他说：“你做俄国第一个女看护！”
    在彼得堡有一个著名的有钱人叫做李亚多夫，吃喝荒淫，腿上染了不治之症。一天，富人得到另外一个医生伊巴托夫的介绍，请教比医师治疗，比医师认为应动手术割治，但富人不听比医师的忠告，继续他的荒淫生活。比医师回到医院，御医来了，拟禁止比医师的工作，说他不奉命用欧洲公认的旧方法，但比医师理直气壮地说：“欧洲常把许多走方郎中公认为真正科学家，我们不能好歹都接受。”说罢，便不顾而去，继续用新法医治病人，结果，全城的时疫给他和他的学生们扑灭了。
    时疫扑灭之后，比医师，斯库拉成和巴库林娜到郊外游玩休假。斯巴二人恋爱成熟。他们正在游兴很高的时候，伊巴托夫医生从城里赶来找比医师，说富人李亚多夫的腿病严重起来，要求比医师前去诊治，假如医好这病，富人愿捐巨款建一医学院。比医师便与伊医师同返。途中，伊医师劝比医师及时行乐，他说：“人不免一死，死了之后，别人便忘记你的贡献了。”但比医师却说：“我相信祖国决不会忘记我！”伊医师又劝他出国，因为外国更重视他。但比医师说：“科学家离开祖国，并不光荣。”他们走到繁盛的路上，见到游人如鲫，伊医师又说：“你把人间欢乐等闲放过，你看人们生活多欢乐！”比医师却说：“难道这是生活的意义？你没有认识真正的幸福！”接着，他更指出：“在工作中的人是最幸福的！”
    在富人的家中，李亚多夫垂危，群医束手无策。那个御医当然发表一套用星辰精华的玄妙的荒谬医术。比医师诊视病人之后，认为给他们这班庸医所误，对御医等大加斥责，从此，御医与医院监督等更怀恨在心。
    富人李亚多夫终于不治而死，比医师为了证明自己的医治方法正确，愿意把正在诊治中的一个小兵，将行实施的外科手术公开给其他的医生观摩，于是，反动集团便有了一个破坏的机会。等到公开施行手术的那一天，反动派的御医便密使特务，将比医师助手斯库拉成在取麻醉药返医院的途中逮捕。到时，比医师只得把御医的假麻醉药施用，施手术的时候，几乎弄出人命案，而比医师机警，小兵的体格也很好，卒于渡过危险，所有参观的人，都佩服比医师的医术。
    无何，俄国战火弥漫，斯库拉成出狱参战。比医师和巴库林娜和他的一群学生也到前线服务。在战场上斯库拉成受伤了，当他被扛到医疗区时，听到一个很熟的声音，原来就是久别的未婚妻巴库林娜，他们在战地相遇，倍加亲爱，虽然斯库拉成腿部受伤，但有了爱人的安慰，和比医师的医治，不致于残废。
