    In the process of cultivating and promoting cadres, some difficulties have been encountered. The first is the relationship between cadres and the masses. For example, when assessing technical standards, new cadres adopt a responsible attitude, but some backward workers say they cannot do it, causing conflicts. Therefore, new cadres often feel distressed, saying, "I used to be a worker, but being a cadre is really troublesome." The solution to this problem is: Firstly, continuously strengthen the education of workers, raise their awareness, and mobilize advanced workers to lead backward workers; Secondly, the leadership should support the new cadres and teach them how to work and persuade the masses to enhance their confidence; Thirdly, the new cadres themselves should be humble, endure hardship before others, use their brains to think of solutions, and preferably start from their professional skills, patiently teaching the workers their specialties, and then combine this with political education to improve them. This way, the problem will be easier to solve. The second difficulty encountered in cultivating and promoting cadres is that those promoted generally have a lower level of education and weaker working ability. Therefore, it is necessary to further improve their political level and cultural and technical level. The main solution to this problem is on-the-job learning or planned long-term rotational training, or to send promising worker-cadres to specialized technical schools for study.
    State-owned coal mines have gained the following experiences in cultivating worker-cadres: First, promotion should be done step by step. From groups to teams, pits, mines, departments, etc., it is necessary to promote them step by step so that those promoted can familiarize themselves with the situation and gradually increase their experience and working ability. For example, Cui Jishao of Hegang and Zhang Jintang of Jixi have been promoted step by step from pit leaders and section chiefs to deputy mine directors. They are now able to lead three to four thousand people in production. Some mining areas are too eager to promote cadres, immediately transferring cadres who were very energetic and resourceful at the pit entrance to the general trade union, making them feel helpless and unable to do the job, which is very distressing. Second, leading cadres must go deep into the grassroots, familiarize themselves with the lives, demands, and ideological sentiments of worker-cadres, always promote their advantages and strengths, and help them overcome their weaknesses. Third, cultivating worker-cadres requires a long-term perspective, not being afraid of spending a little more money, and making longer-term plans. Some leaders are afraid that transferring cadres from production to study will hinder the work, but they do not see that cadres will play a greater role in production work after training. Fourth, the promotion of cadres should be cautious and bold, and after promotion, they should be patiently helped and cultivated. Avoid dismissing them as soon as they make a mistake, as this will make worker-cadres feel that there is no future and they will not want to be cadres. If there are indeed major errors that require dismissal, it can be done after mass discussion and full explanation to the masses to educate cadres and workers.

    教育新干部加强职工团结
    调整新干部和工人的关系
    提高新干部政治文化水平
    在培养提拔干部中，曾遇到一些困难，首先是干部与群众的关系问题。如评定技术标准时，新干部采取对工作负责的态度去评定，有些落后工人就说做不到，引起矛盾。因此，新干部常发生苦恼“觉得自己原是工人，当了干部真麻烦。”解决这一问题的办法：第一、要不断加强对工人的教育，提高工人觉悟，并发动先进工人去带动落后工人；第二、领导上给新干部撑腰，教育他们如何去工作与说服群众，以增强其信心；第三、新干部自己要谦虚，吃苦在前，多用脑子想办法，最好能从业务技术上着手，将自己擅长的技术，耐心教给工人，再结合政治教育去提高他们。这样问题就比较好解决了。培养提拔干部中遇到的第二个困难，是被提拔者一般的文化程度较低，工作能力较弱。因此必须进一步提高其政治水平与文化技术水平。解决这个问题的主要办法，是在职学习或有计划地作较长期的轮训，或抽调有发展前途的工人干部去专门技术学校学习。
    国营煤矿在培养工人干部中，获得如下几点经验：一、应该按级提升。由小组到班、坑、矿、科等，须一级级往上提，使被提拔者在逐级提升中能够熟习情况，逐渐增长经验和工作能力。如鹤岗的崔基绍、鸡西的张金堂经过坑长、股长等逐级提升到副矿长。已能领导三四千人进行生产。有些矿区急于提拔，把原在坑口表现得生龙活虎很有办法的干部，一下提到总工会，使其感到没办法，干不了，很苦恼。二、领导干部必须深入下层，熟习工人干部的生活、要求和思想情绪，随时发扬他们的优点和长处，帮助克服弱点。三、培养工人干部要把眼光放远一点，不怕多花一点本钱，要作较长期的打算。有些领导者怕从生产中调干部去学习妨碍了工作，没有看到干部受训后在生产工作中作用更大。四、提拔干部要慎重大胆，提拔后要耐心地帮助和培养。切忌一发生错误即撤换，这样会使工人干部感觉没前途而不愿当干部。如实在有重大错误需撤换时，可经过群众讨论，并充分向群众解释以教育干部和工人。
