Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 21st: TASS, Moscow, January 21st: Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky recently issued the following statement regarding U.S. Secretary of State Acheson's speech:

On January 12th, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson spoke at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., regarding U.S. policy in Asia. This speech attempted to defend the U.S. policy toward Asian countries, particularly China, but it failed.

Secretary of State Acheson put on the mask of a "friend" of the Asian peoples and claimed that non-American territories such as Japan, the Ryukyu Islands, and the Philippines were America's "defense line" (everyone knows that this is actually an aggressive line), thus he could not help but reveal his expansionist plans for these places. Acheson said a lot about his willingness to "help" the people of Asian countries, which clearly implied that the reactionary forces in these countries and the colonial powers unwilling to give up exploiting the Asian people could expect all assistance from Mr. Acheson.

In this speech, Acheson did not miss the opportunity to make some hostile noises towards the Soviet Union and did not hesitate to use blatant slander.

Secretary of State Acheson specifically discussed the Soviet Union's position on areas bordering Asia and the Soviet Union, and also paid special attention to northern China. He claimed in this regard: "The Russians' interests in northern China and other areas existed long before communism. This is by no means something that originated from communism. It existed long before communism. But the communist regime has added new methods, new techniques, and new ideas to the advancement of Russian imperialism. Armed with this new power, something like this is happening in China, the Soviet Union is detaching northern regions of China from China and making them dependent on the Soviet Union. This process has been completed in Outer Mongolia. It is almost completed in Manchuria. And I am sure that in Inner Mongolia, in Xinjiang, Soviet agents must have very pleasant reports sent to Moscow. This is what is going on. This is detaching the entire vast area inhabited by Chinese people from China and making it dependent on the Soviet Union. I would like to talk about this matter, which may violate my anti-dogmatism, but in any case, I would like to state that the fact that the Soviet Union is seizing four regions of northern China is the single most meaningful and important fact in any foreign relationship with Asia."

Acheson's remarks are so absurd. At first glance, we even doubt its reliability, thinking that the newspaper must have mistaken Secretary of State Acheson for an irresponsible journalist. However, upon examination, it turns out that Secretary of State Acheson did indeed make such a vain and crudely fabricated slanderous statement.

Acheson actually said exactly that, claiming that the Soviet Union "is detaching the northern regions of China from China and making them dependent on the Soviet Union," and "the Soviet Union is seizing four regions of northern China." According to Acheson, it seems that the Soviet Union has already completed this in the case of Outer Mongolia. He finally claimed that the Soviet Union is also detaching Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang from China.

It is not difficult to see that all of Acheson's remarks have no basis in reality. All these absurd remarks are fabricated by Acheson, attempting to slander the Soviet Union's foreign policy in order to save face when the competition has failed, and thereby shift the responsibility for the failure of their own policies to the Soviet Union.

Acheson pretends to be the protector of China. He has made many absurd remarks about the Soviet Union and the relationship between the Soviet Union and China. He has obviously forgotten that there are facts that completely refute him. The most important fact is that China now has its own people's government, which knows how to defend the interests of its country, its territory, and its people. The relationship between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union has a solid foundation of friendship and mutual respect for independence and territorial integrity.

The so-called "Outer Mongolia" has existed as an independent and autonomous country—the Mongolian People's Republic—for more than thirty years (this matter was specifically pointed out in the Yalta Agreement between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union). This is common sense. As early as 1945, the Mongolian People's Republic was recognized by the then Chinese government, and now the Mongolian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China have also established normal diplomatic relations. What is surprising about Acheson's remarks about the Mongolian People's Republic being dependent on the Soviet Union is less its brazenness and vanity than its disregard and contempt for the audience at the National Press Club in Washington.

Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang are still within Chinese territory. This is common sense and cannot be doubted by normal people. If Acheson continues to spread slanderous rumors about these territories being incorporated into the Soviet Union, it is clearly not "out of good intentions," but his bankrupt so-called policy toward China forces him to do so. In any case, Acheson has not yet fabricated any convincing arguments to defend his policy of continuing to pursue in China that policy of ignoring Chiang Kai-shek's complete failure and the establishment of the People's Republic of China.

It is quite meaningful to compare Acheson's remarks on January 12th with the remarks made to reporters by Walter, the former U.S. Consul General in Shenyang, who recently returned to the United States on January 14th. Walter declared that he lived in Manchuria and "did not see any signs of the Soviet Union supervising Manchuria," and he "did not see any signs of the Soviet Union annexing Manchuria." Even someone as hostile to the Soviet Union as U.S. Consul Walter had to bow before the undeniable facts. This is worth noting.

Now the whole world knows that despite the United States spending tens of billions of dollars, Acheson's policy toward China has suffered a disastrous defeat. This policy could only end in a disastrous defeat because it took supporting the reactionary forces in China and openly fighting against the democratic forces in China as its own task. Attempting to cover up the failure of his policy with a smoke screen of slander and shifting the responsibility for the failure to the Soviet Union will not do Mr. Acheson any good. This attempt will only lead to new failures in the U.S. policy toward China.

    驳斥艾奇逊荒谬谰言
    艾奇逊对中苏关系的诽谤，目的在于掩盖其侵略政策的惨败。
    【新华社北京二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：苏联外交部长维辛斯基顷就美国国务卿艾奇逊的演说，发表声明如下：美国国务卿艾奇逊一月十二日在华盛顿美国全国新闻俱乐部讲到美国的亚洲政策。这篇演说企图为美国对亚洲各国、特别是对中国的政策辩解，然而未能成功。
    国务卿艾奇逊戴上亚洲各国人民之“友”的假面具，声称日本、琉球群岛与菲律宾这些非美国的领土，是美国的“防御线”（大家都知道，这其实是侵略线），于是他就无论如何不得不泄露出他对这些地方的扩张主义计划。艾奇逊关于他愿意“帮助”亚洲各国人民，说了许多话，其中显然含蓄着一个意思：这些国家的反动势力以及不愿放弃剥削亚洲人民的殖民强国，可望得到艾奇逊先生的一切援助。
    艾奇逊在这次演说中并未放过机会，对苏联发出一些敌意的叫嚣，并且毫不犹豫地使用明显的诽谤。
    国务卿艾奇逊特别谈论了苏联对于亚洲与苏联接壤各地的立场，并且还对中国北部加以特别的注意。他曾就此声称：“俄国人在中国北部以及其他那些地区的利益，远在共产主义之前就存在了。这绝不是从共产主义发生的东西。它的存在远在共产主义之前。但共产党政权给俄国帝国主义的推进，增加了新的方法、新的技巧、和新的观念。在这种新力量的武装之下，中国正在发生这样的事情，苏联正使中国北部地区脱离中国，并使它们依附苏联。这种过程已在外蒙古完成了。它在满洲已几近完成。而且我确信，在内蒙古、在新疆，苏联的代理人一定有很愉快的报告送到莫斯科。这就是正在进行的一切。这就是使中国人所居住的整个广大地区脱离中国，而依附苏联。我愿讲一讲这件事，这或者违反我的不武断主义，但无论如何我愿表示：苏联正在夺取中国北部四个地区的事实，在任何外国与亚洲的关系中是唯一最意味深长的最重要的事实。”
    艾奇逊的这段言论是这样的荒谬透顶。乍一听来，我们还怀疑它的可靠性，以为必定是报纸把国务卿艾奇逊错认为某一个不负责任的新闻记者了。然而，加以审查之后，原来国务卿艾奇逊竟然的确作了这种虚妄的粗制滥造的诽谤言论。
    艾奇逊竟然是丝毫不差地那样说的，他声言苏联“正在使中国北部地区脱离中国，并使它们依附苏联”，“苏联正在夺取中国北部的四个地区”。按艾奇逊说来，好像是就外蒙古而论，苏联已经完成了这件事。他最后声言，苏联而且正在使内蒙古和新疆脱离中国。
    不难看出，艾奇逊的所有这些言论，并无丝毫真实性。所有这些荒谬言论都是由艾奇逊堆砌起来，在竞赛失败了的时候保持面子的，企图用来毁谤苏联的外交政策，并从而把他们自己政策失败的责任推诿给苏联。
    艾奇逊冒充为中国的保护人。关于苏联及苏联与中国的关系说了许多荒谬的言论，他显然忘记了还有完全驳倒他的事实存在。最重要的是这样的事实：中国现在有它自己的人民政府，这个政府知道如何保卫它的国家的利益，它的领土，它的人民，中华人民共和国与苏联的关系，有着友好及两国互相尊重独立与领土完整的坚实基础。
    所谓“外蒙古”，它作为一个独立、自主的国家——蒙古人民共和国，已经一直存在三十多年了（这件事实在美、英、苏三国的雅尔塔协定中，曾特别指出过）。这是常识。远在一九四五年，蒙古人民共和国就为当时的中国政府所承认，而现在蒙古人民共和国和中华人民共和国也已经建立了正常的外交关系。艾奇逊关于蒙古人民共和国依附苏联的这种言论的使人吃惊之处，与其说是它的厚颜和虚妄，倒不如说是它对华盛顿全国新闻俱乐部听众们的无视和轻蔑。
    满洲、内蒙古和新疆仍然是在中国领土之内，这是常识，而且是正常的人所不能够怀疑的。如果艾奇逊仍然总是这样从事散布关于这些领土并入苏联的诽谤谣言，那显然不是“出于好心”，而是他的破了产的所谓对华政策迫使他这样做的。无论如何，艾奇逊就是到现在也还没有杜撰出任何令人信服的论据，来辩护他无视蒋介石的全盘失败和中华人民共和国的成立这个事实，而在中国继续奉行的那种政策。
    把艾奇逊在一月十二日所发表的言论，和最近回到美国的前美国驻沈阳总领事瓦尔德于一月十四日对记者所发表的谈话，对照一下，是颇有意味的。瓦尔德宣称：他住在满洲“并未看见有苏联监督满洲的任何迹象”，他“并未看见有苏联吞并满洲的任何迹象”。甚至像美国领事瓦尔德这样敌视苏联的人，也不得不在无可置辩的事实面前低头，这是值得重视的。
    现在全世界都知道：尽管美国花费了数十亿美元，艾奇逊对中国的政策却遭到了惨败。这种政策只能有惨败的结局，因为它把支持中国的反动力量并对中国的民主力量进行公开的斗争作为自己的任务。用诽谤的烟幕来掩盖他的政策之失败，并且把失败的责任推诿给苏联，这种企图对艾奇逊先生是没有什么好处的。这种企图只会使美国对中国的政策遭到新的失败。
