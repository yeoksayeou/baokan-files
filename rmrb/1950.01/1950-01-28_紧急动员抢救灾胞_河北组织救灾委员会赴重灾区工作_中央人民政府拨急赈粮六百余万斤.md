    Emergency Mobilization to Rescue Disaster-Stricken Compatriots
    Hebei Organizes Disaster Relief Committee to Work in Severely Affected Areas
    Central People's Government Allocates Over Six Million Jin of Emergency Relief Grain
    [This newspaper's Baoding, 27th dispatch] The disaster situation in the severely affected areas of Ninghe, Baodi, Yutian, and Jixian, under the jurisdiction of the Hebei Tianjin, Tangshan, and Tongxian Special Districts, remains very serious. Production in the area of 650,000 people has been greatly affected, and the majority of the disaster victims have currently lost their ability to work. Villages in these areas are surrounded by ice and snow. The thaw period is approaching, and after the thaw, the combination of rain and snow will make it difficult for people, horses, carts, and boats to move, making it impossible to transport grain or conduct business, and life will become even more difficult. In order to urgently rescue the vast number of disaster victims, centrally guide the distribution of emergency relief grain, and further lead the development of a production self-salvation movement, the Hebei Provincial People's Government and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have decided to organize the Ning, Bao, Ji, Yu Disaster Relief Committee, with Li Ziguang, Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, as the Director, and Li Jihuan, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, Li Kecai, Deputy Commissioner of the Tianjin Special Commissioner's Office, Wang Zhiqun, Deputy Commissioner of the Tongxian Special Commissioner's Office, and Wu Yushan, Deputy Commissioner of the Tangshan Special Commissioner's Office, as Deputy Directors. On the morning of the 28th, Li Ziguang and more than sixty others will leave for the severely affected areas to work. Another medical team of more than one hundred and thirty people will also rush to the severely affected areas on the same day to treat sick disaster victims. The primary task of the committee is to distribute emergency relief grain, first providing relief to the elderly, young, orphans, and widows, ensuring that grain arrives wherever people are, and striving to distribute it to households quickly. The second step is to organize the masses to engage in various forms of production; supply and marketing cooperatives, banks, and trade departments will provide strong support to ensure the supply of raw materials and the marketing of products, and to solve the difficulties faced by disaster victims in their lives and production. At the same time, the Tianjin Special District also held an emergency meeting, with Deputy Commissioner Li Kecai, Deputy Secretary of the CCP District Committee Zhu Kang, and Deputy Minister of the Organization Department Zhao Ke leading more than two hundred and sixty cadres to rush to the severely affected areas of Ninghe and Baodi counties to lead emergency rescue efforts, rush to transport grain, and distribute relief grain, in order to fully assist the disaster victims in overcoming the serious famine.
    After the Hebei Provincial Government recently reported the serious disaster situation to the State Council, the Central People's Government was extremely concerned and immediately allocated the first batch of 6.5 million jin of emergency relief grain, ordering it to be quickly collected from the nearest warehouses and transported to the severely affected areas for distribution to rescue hundreds of thousands of disaster victims. At present, the emergency relief grain allocated by the Central People's Government has been largely distributed to Tianjin, Tangshan, Tongxian, and Cangxian Special Districts, and various localities have begun to rapidly transport and distribute it to the severely affected areas.

    河北省政府最近将严重灾情向政务院报告以后，中央人民政府极为关怀，立即拨发首批急赈粮六百五十万斤，着令从最近的仓库迅速领取，赶快运到重灾区放赈，抢救几十万灾民。现中央人民政府拨发的急赈粮已将大部分发到天津、唐山、通县及沧县等专区，各地已开始向重灾区迅速运送发放。
