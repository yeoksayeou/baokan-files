    Rectifying and Developing the People's Salt Industry
    Jiang Heng
    The recently concluded National Salt Affairs Conference held in the capital has been a resounding success. This was an unprecedented grand gathering for the people's salt affairs work. At this conference, the following three major plans were thoroughly discussed and approved: (1) The national salt affairs guiding principles and tasks. (2) The national salt affairs production, transportation, and sales guiding principles and tasks, sales area division, and production-sales relationships. (3) The national tax rates and tax revenue tasks, and the organization of salt affairs institutions at all levels. The resolution and determination of these important issues not only represent a preliminary rectification and transformation of the old salt affairs work and many unreasonable old systems and measures, but also provide a full guarantee for ensuring the people's food supply and meeting the needs of national finances. This will rectify and develop the people's salt industry to gradually adapt to the people's democratic fiscal and economic policies.
    Today, all major salt producing areas in the country, except for individual areas such as Taiwan, are under the leadership of the People's Government and are beginning to transform and recover. Some salt fields that were liberated earlier, such as the Changlu salt fields, have already preliminarily improved some unreasonable old measures, such as appropriately improving the living conditions of salt workers, and have initially mobilized the workers to form trade unions, enabling worker representatives to participate in the salt affairs management committee (composed of the salt affairs bureau, workers, and salt producers). In addition, a system of profit sharing above quotas has been adopted. As a result, the production enthusiasm of salt workers has been greatly enhanced, and they have actively participated in anti-smuggling efforts, turning anti-smuggling into a mass movement. Considerable achievements have also been made in reducing costs and saving materials, with production costs reduced by 30 to 40 percent compared to the past.
    However, all of this is just a beginning. Today's salt affairs construction work is still in the process of transformation. Therefore, how to improve the people's salt affairs work in the future, clarify guiding principles and tasks, strengthen production and sales planning, and unify salt affairs institutions and tax rates are indeed urgent measures at present.
    Salt is a natural resource of the country and a necessity for people's lives. From the perspective of the development direction of the salt industry, state-owned operations should be the main focus. However, today, private operations still account for a large proportion of salt production and sales (averaging about 80 percent in salt fields in various regions within the customs). The country's construction is facing numerous tasks, and especially in a New Democratic society, private capitalism that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood should not only be allowed to exist but also be helped to develop. Therefore, we must cooperate with these private salt fields and guarantee their legitimate profits. We must oppose the tendency to exclude private operations in our work. As pointed out at this conference, the correct approach should be to adopt public-private joint management, so that salt producers gradually move towards cooperative production. At the same time, develop public operations gradually where conditions permit. Secondly, from the perspective of the state's planned economy requirements, in order to have a clear division of labor and specialized responsibilities, in principle, production should be under industry, transportation and sales under trade, and taxation under finance, adopting a major division of labor system. But to achieve this, sufficient preparation time and conditions are needed; at least within this year, we can only adopt the principle of unified production and taxation, and separate transportation and sales. Except for the Northwest, which must maintain the status quo due to special circumstances, salt affairs work in the Northeast, North China, and Central China can gradually transition to a more advanced scientific division of labor.
    Based on this guiding principle, in the future, efforts should be made to achieve the following in production, transportation and sales, and taxation:
    In production, a system of public-private combination should be adopted, with production determined by sales, ensuring output and improving quality. On the existing basis, both public and private salt fields can uniformly stipulate production profits, formulate production plans based on transportation and sales conditions, maintain normal transportation and sales, and overcome the state of unplanned and anarchic production. It is also necessary to improve equipment with a focus, and improve production, so that production gradually reaches rationalization and industrialization. However, this cannot be done by adopting a method of developing or not developing across the board, but should be adapted to local conditions; those salt fields that are concentrated, easy to manage, have low costs, high quality, convenient transportation, and low freight rates should be appropriately developed in the future; the state can also increase investment, first improve production equipment such as windmills and motors, and then gradually develop salt fields. If some salt fields meet the above conditions, but are not convenient to develop at present, the status quo should be maintained. For those that do not meet the above conditions, but are necessary for local food supply, or although not necessary, are difficult to switch to other industries for the time being, the status quo should also be maintained; those with too poor operating conditions, which are not important to the food supply, and are easy to switch to other industries, should be gradually reduced in production until finally abolished.
    In terms of transportation and sales: in general, public-private joint transportation and sales should be achieved, with unified planning and strengthened management. In areas where transportation and sales are separated from production, salt companies should support and unite with salt merchants to jointly undertake transportation and sales tasks, uniformly formulate transportation and sales plans, and ensure the food supply and the completion of financial tasks. In the implementation of transportation and sales plans and price policies, salt merchants should be subject to the management of salt companies, and at the same time, salt merchants should be given legitimate profits and convenience in the use of transportation tools.
    However, it should be especially noted here that the division of labor between production and transportation and sales is not mutually exclusive, but interdependent. On the one hand, "production should guarantee transportation and sales," and on the other hand, it is necessary to guarantee sales, and guarantee the supply of food, cloth, fuel, etc. needed for production. At the same time, transportation and sales must also guarantee tax revenue.
    In order to ensure the completion of transportation and sales plans and financial tasks, the salt bureau should also appropriately expand its anti-smuggling armed forces, so that anti-smuggling in the producing areas is combined with anti-smuggling in the sales areas, and anti-smuggling of salt in the sales areas is combined with anti-smuggling of other taxes. However, all localities should organize and plan to mobilize the masses to combat smuggling, turning anti-smuggling into a mass movement to protect state tax revenue.
    In terms of salt tax, the needs of war and national construction should be taken into account, and salt tax should also bear a certain financial task. However, in order to encourage industry and fishing, industrial salt should be completely tax-free, and fishing salt tax should also be appropriately reduced. Exported salt should be appropriately handled according to specific circumstances.
    Finally, in order to uniformly implement salt affairs policies and guidelines, and complete production and tax revenue tasks, adjusting the existing salt affairs organizational structure to achieve unity in principle is also an indispensable condition for ensuring the completion of tasks.
    How to combine the spirit of this conference with the actual situation in the future and earnestly implement it will become an important link in steadily rectifying and developing the people's salt industry.

    整顿与发展人民盐业
    江横
    最近在首都举行的全国盐务会议，已胜利地闭幕了。这是人民盐务工作空前的一次盛会，在这次会上周密地讨论了并且通过了这样三大方案：（一）全国盐务方针任务。（二）全国盐务的生产运销方针任务与销区划分及产销关系。（三）全国税率及税收任务，各级盐务机构组织。对于这些重要问题的解决和确定，不仅对旧有的盐务工作和许多不合理的旧有制度措施，是一个初步的整顿和改造，而且对保证民食的任务，解决国家财政的需要，有了充分的保证。并由此整顿与发展人民盐业，以逐渐适合于人民民主主义的财政经济政策。
    今天全国各大盐区，除台湾等个别产区外，均已在人民政府领导之下，开始转化与恢复中；有些解放较早的盐滩如长芦盐滩则已初步改善了某些不合理的旧措施，如适当的改善了盐工生活；并初步发动了工人群众组成工会，使工人代表参加了盐务管理委员会（由盐务局、工人、皂户组成），此外又采取了超额分红制；因之，盐工的生产情绪大大提高，并主动地参加缉私，把缉私变成群众性的运动。在减本节料方面，也做出相当成绩，生产成本要比过去减低了百分之三十到四十。
    然而，这一切仅仅是一个开端，今天的盐务建设工作还正是处在转化的过程中。因此，今后如何搞好人民的盐务工作，明确方针任务，加强产销计划性，统一盐务机构及税率，确为当前紧要之措施。
    盐为国家天然富源，又为人民生活必需品，从盐业的发展方向上来看，应当以国营为主。但今天盐务的产销，私营尚占很大比例（关内各区盐场平均约占百分之八十），国家建设百废待举，特别是在新民主主义社会中，对有利于国计民生的私人资本主义，不仅允许其存在，并要帮助其发展。因而我们必须与这些私营盐场合作，并保证其合法利润。在工作中要反对排斥私营的偏向，正如这次大会上所指出的：正确的应该采取公私兼营，使盐民逐渐走向合作生产。同时，有条件的，缓步的发展公营。其次，从国家的计划经济要求来看，为了分工严、责任专，原则上应当生产归工业，运销归贸易，税收归财政，采取大分工制。但要做到这，还需要充分的准备时间和条件；至少在今年之内只能采取产税统一、运销分开的方针。除西北因特殊情况，仍须维持现状外，东北、华北、华中盐务工作，将可由此逐渐渡到更进一步的科学分工。
    依据这一方针，今后在生产、运销、税收各个方面，应该努力做到这样几点：
    在生产方面，要做到公私兼制，以销定产，保证产量，提高质量。在现有基础上，公私盐滩均可统一规定生产利润，依据运销情况制定生产计划，保持运销正常，克服无计划无政府状态；并须有重点的改进设备，提高生产，使生产逐渐达到合理化、工业化。但这不能采取一概发展或不发展的办法，应该因地制宜；凡盐场集中，便于管理，成本低、质量高，交通便利，运价低廉者，今后宜适当发展；国家还可增加投资，首先改善风车马达等生产设备，然后徐图发展盐滩。如果有些盐场虽符合于以上条件，目前尚不便发展者，维持现状。对不合于上述条件，而为当地民食所必需，或虽非必需，一时尚难转业者，亦维持现状；凡经营条件太差，对民食无关重要，又便于转业，则应逐渐减产以至最后裁废。
    在运销方面：一般的应做到公私兼运兼销，统一计划，加强管理。在运销及生产分开的地区，盐业公司应扶助与团结盐商共同担负运销任务，统一制定运销计划，保证民食与完成财政任务。在执行运销计划与价格政策上，盐商应受盐业公司的管理，同时应使盐商获得合法利润，并给以使用运输工具的便利。
    但是，这里应特别注意的，生产与运销的分工，并不是互不相关，而是互为依存，一面“以产量保证运销”，一面要保证销量，并保证生产上所需要之食粮、布匹、燃料等等供给。同时运销也要保证税收。
    为保证运销计划与财政任务的完成，盐局还应适当扩大缉私武装，使产区缉私与销区缉私相结合，在销区使盐斤缉私与其他税收缉私相结合。但各地应有组织的有计划的发动群众缉私，把缉私变成群众性的运动，以保护国家税收。
    在盐税方面，应照顾战争与国家建设的需要，盐税还应担负一定的财政任务。但为奖励工业渔业，工业用盐应完全免税，渔盐业税亦适当减轻，输出盐则应根据具体情况予以适当处理。
    最后，为统一贯彻盐务政策方针，完成生产税收任务，将现有盐务机构编制加以调整，达到原则上的统一，也是保证完成任务的一个不可缺少的条件。
    今后在工作中如何结合实际情况切实贯彻执行此次大会的精神，将成为为稳步整顿与发展人民盐业的重要一环。
