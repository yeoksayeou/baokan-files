Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 18th: The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government jointly issued an order on the 12th, unifying the regulations on rank division, uniforms, collar badges, cap badges, and supply treatment standards for people's police in all parts of the country. According to the regulations, police chiefs and police officers are assessed in three grades, namely first, second, and third-class police chiefs, and first, second, and third-class police officers; cadres are not included in this division. Police officers refer to those who have undergone a certain period of training, passed the examination, and are currently working as police officers. The assessment is based on political attitude, work performance, connection with the masses, and technical skill. Specific methods are to be formulated by local areas based on actual conditions, approved by the public security departments, bureaus, and offices of the Greater Administrative Areas, provinces, and municipalities under provincial jurisdiction, and the implementation reported to the Central Ministry of Public Security. The salary standard is based on the local general living standard of the masses for a third-class police officer, with the ability to support one and a half people in addition to the necessary expenses for personal living as the starting point, with a 3% increase for each higher grade, calculated in terms of millet. Accordingly, a second-class police officer gets a 3% increase, a first-class police officer gets a 6% increase, a third-class police chief gets a 9% increase, and so on. Those with special skills (such as fire brigades) or significant work achievements may be rewarded or promoted one grade at the discretion of authorities; the previous merit-based pay raise system is abolished. Uniforms are issued by the state, khaki in summer and dark green in winter. Uniform styles will be issued separately, but those made this winter that do not conform to the regulations need not be remade. The left and right collar badges are both parallelogram-shaped copper badges, green background, yellow border, yellow characters, 6 cm long, 2 cm wide, with an iron angle of 85 degrees. The right collar badge has the four characters "人民警察" (People's Police), and the left collar badge has an Arabic numeral number, prefixed with the first character according to the business, such as "交" (Jiao) for traffic police, "消" (Xiao) for fire police, and "户" (Hu) for household registration police. The cap badge is a yellow-bordered red five-pointed star with the yellow characters "公安" (Public Security) embedded inside. The method of making the five-pointed star is the same as that of the People's Liberation Army cap badge.
