    The United Nations' Test
    The United Nations is undergoing a severe test. After Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai telegraphed the United Nations demanding the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's representatives from the Security Council, the Soviet representative firmly supported China's demand in the Security Council. After the American bloc refused to expel the Chiang bandit representatives, the Soviet Union announced that it would not participate in the work of the Security Council and would not recognize any resolutions passed by the Security Council with the participation of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang representatives. Now, the Soviet representative has withdrawn from the Security Council, and representatives of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in the United Nations agencies have also successively withdrawn from meetings attended by representatives of the Kuomintang. This is a major action to safeguard the United Nations as an international organization for maintaining international peace, security, and justice, and a major action to prevent the United Nations from losing its credibility and heading towards destruction by allowing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang representatives to remain. The question now facing the United Nations is: should it shelter the Chiang bandit rogue representatives and let the United Nations head towards destruction? Or should it oppose the reactionary position of the American bloc and implement the just demands of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union? This is a test for the American bloc, and it is also a test for all member states of the United Nations.
    The Kuomintang representatives in the United Nations, apart from representing a small group of rogues who fled from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan, do not represent anyone and have long become "political zombies." However, the American imperialists stubbornly cling to this walking corpse so that they can manipulate it to prevent representatives of our new China from participating in the United Nations. This incident proves that as long as there is a soldier, even a zombie like Chiang Ting-fu, the American imperialists will use it to oppose the Chinese people. The representative of the United Kingdom stood with the United States in the Security Council. Although the British government has announced the severance of diplomatic relations with the Kuomintang remnant government and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, the British representative is unwilling to drive the Kuomintang representatives out of the Security Council. The attitude of the British representative in the Security Council certainly does not indicate friendship towards the People's Republic of China. This indefensible contradictory behavior exposes the true face of British foreign policy. The result of the reactionary policy adopted by the US-British bloc has currently left the United Nations agencies in a state of semi-paralysis.
    Our Central People's Government has officially appointed the chief representative to the United Nations and has notified the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Romulo, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Trygve Lie, to request prompt attendance at the United Nations meetings and participation in work. This is a serious test of the United Nations' maintenance of credibility with the Chinese people.
    The struggle waged in the Security Council over the issue of expelling the Kuomintang remnant bandits representatives once again proves that only the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are the defenders of human justice and reliable friends of the Chinese people; while the imperialists stubbornly oppose the Chinese people.
    The Contradictions and Unity of the Imperialists
    The struggle unfolded in the United Nations agencies also provides an example for people, that is, although there are contradictions between the imperialist blocs, although there are contradictions between the ruling classes of the imperialist countries, they are basically united in preparing for new wars and opposing peace, in plundering colonies and semi-colonies and opposing national liberation movements, in attacking the basic rights and living standards of the people of all countries and opposing the development of socialist and people's democratic countries. There are many such examples worldwide.
    It is undeniable that the US and British imperialists have had contradictions on a series of issues, or are currently experiencing contradictions. On the issue of leadership of the North Atlantic regional aggression plan, on the constitution of the "Falidahlu" and other Western European groups, on the negotiation of "bilateral agreements" for dominating aggressive weapons, on the rearmament of West Germany and the invasion of West Germany by American monopoly capital, on the production of atomic bombs and "research work" on atomic energy, on the "dollar panic" and trade policy, on the oil issue, on the British "Colonial Development Corporation" plan and the American "Aid to Backward Areas" plan, and on the threat of increasing American labor invasion into the Middle East, Near East, and British autonomous territories and colonies, Downing Street has expressed so-called "polite resistance" to Wall Street, and these two major imperialists have constantly quarreled for their own disgraceful interests, and even showed some degree of divergence in their actions. However, the more the imperialists are plunged into the difficulties of an irredeemable economic crisis, the more they increase their hatred for the cause of peace and for countries that have embarked on or are embarking on the path of socialism. Therefore, the quarrels, differences, and contradictions between the United States and Britain have not relaxed their frantic race for arms expansion and war preparation, nor will they hinder them from adopting a consistent approach in the criminal cause of opposing the people of the world.
    From the Colombo Conference to the Bangkok Conference
    The recent activities of the US and British imperialists in the Far East can vividly illustrate this point.
    On the Japanese issue, there is a distance between the policies of the United Kingdom and the United States. MacArthur actively supports Japanese militarism, and American monopoly capital has invaded Japanese industry, directly threatening the safety and commercial interests of British autonomous territories and colonies. However, the Colombo Conference, which concluded on January 14, reiterated the "temporary conclusion" of the 1947 Canberra Conference on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Japan, that is, it advocated that the Eleven-Nation Far East Commission should decide the content of the peace treaty with Japan, abandoning the procedure of preparing the peace treaty with Japan by the Council of Foreign Ministers, in order to exclude the Soviet Union and new China, and agreed that the United States "has the decisive say."
    There are also contradictions between the United States and Britain in striving for leadership over the reactionaries in Southeast Asian countries. The "Pacific Alliance" instigated by the United States and the "Southeast Asia Group" supported by the United Kingdom have not yet taken concrete organizational form. But they have reached a common conclusion: to use "Asian nationalism" to prevent the "development of communism in Southeast Asia." In other words, they want to unite the national scum of various Asian countries to jointly deal with the liberation movement of the people of Southeast Asia.
    There is a struggle between the United States and Britain in plundering the economic control of Southeast Asian countries, especially in India, Indonesia, and Thailand. The "Southeast Asia Economic Development Proposal" and the "British Commonwealth Mutual Assistance Plan" discussed at the Colombo Conference contradict the American "Point Four Program." The American ruling class is particularly sensitive to this point. The New York Times and the Herald Tribune unanimously urged "the United States to wholeheartedly cooperate with the economic proposals and mutual assistance plans of the British Commonwealth." This means that Wall Street will strengthen its pressure on the City of London, turning the "Southeast Asia Economic Development Proposal" into a tributary of the "Point Four Program."
    Before the opening of the Colombo Conference, Bevin ordered the British Ambassador to the United States, Franks, to return to the United Kingdom on the 23rd to obtain a report on the Colombo Conference, so as to fully inform Acheson. According to the United Press, "Bevin is determined to reduce the differences with the United States on Far East issues." The imperialists are unwilling to admit the failure of their aggressive policies, unwilling to accept the lessons of history, and continue to engage in desperate struggles, and are enemies of the people of various Far Eastern countries. From this perspective, the Colombo Conference can also be said to be a preparatory meeting for the Bangkok Conference to be held soon. As is well known, the Bangkok Conference is an important meeting for the US imperialists to reorganize their Far East aggression plan.

    联合国的考验
    联合国正经历着严重的考验。在我国周外长致电联合国要求把蒋介石匪帮代表从安理会开除出去之后，苏联代表在安理会上坚决支持我国的要求，并在美国集团拒绝把蒋匪代表驱逐出去之后，宣布在国民党代表依然留在安理会之前，苏联即不参加安理会的工作，也不承认安理会在蒋介石匪帮代表参加下所通过的任何决议。现在，苏联代表已退出了安理会，苏联和人民民主国家在联合国机构中的代表也陆续退出了有国民党代表出席的会议。这是维护联合国作为一个维持国际和平安全和正义的国际机构的重大行动，也是阻止联合国因让国民党匪帮代表留下去而致威信扫地、走向毁灭的重大行动。现在摆在联合国面前的问题是：究竟是把蒋匪流寇代表庇护下去，让联合国走向毁灭呢？还是反对美国集团的反动立场，实行中华人民共和国和苏联的正义主张呢？这是美国集团的考验，同时也是联合国所有会员国的考验。
    联合国中的国民党代表，除了代表从中国大陆逃到台湾去的一小撮流寇外并不代表任何人，早已成了“政治僵尸”。然而，美帝国主义者却死死抱着这个行尸走肉不放，以便任他摆布，阻止我们新中国的代表参加联合国。这件事情证明，只要还有一兵一卒，甚至像蒋廷黻那样的僵尸也好，美帝国主义都要用来反对中国人民的。在安理会中和美国站在一起的有英国的代表。虽然英国政府已宣布与国民党残余政府断绝外交关系，而与中华人民共和国建立外交关系，但英国的代表却不愿把国民党代表赶出安理会。英国代表在安理会中的态度，当然不是表示对于中华人民共和国的友好。这种不可辩解的自相矛盾的行为，暴露了英国外交政策的真象。美英集团采取这种反动政策的结果，目前已使联合国机构处于半瘫痪的状态中。
    我中央人民政府已正式任命出席联合国的首席代表，并照会联合国大会主席罗慕洛和联合国秘书长赖伊，要求迅速出席联合国会议和参加工作。这正是联合国对中国人民维持信誉的一个严重考验。
    安理会在对开除国民党残匪代表这一问题上所展开的斗争，又一次证明了：唯有苏联和人民民主国家才是人类正义的卫护者，是中国人民的可靠朋友；而帝国主义者则是顽固地敌视中国人民的。
    帝国主义者的矛盾和一致
    联合国机构中所展开的斗争，同时为人们提供了一个例证，这就是尽管帝国主义集团间存在着矛盾，尽管帝国主义国家的统治阶级间存在着矛盾，但他们在准备新战争和反对和平事业上，在掠夺殖民地半殖民地和反对民族解放运动上，在进攻各国人民基本权利和生活水平和反对社会主义和人民民主国家的发展上，基本上是一致的。在世界范围内，这样的例子还多得很。
    不可否认美英帝国主义者曾在一连串的问题上发生了矛盾，或正在发生着矛盾。在北大西洋区域侵略计划的领导权问题上，在“法利大卢”和其它西欧集团的构成上，在支配侵略武器的“双边协定”谈判上，在再武装西德和美国垄断资本侵入西德问题上，在原子弹的生产和原子能的“研究工作”上，在“美元恐慌”和贸易政策上，在石油问题上，在英国“殖民地开发公司”计划与美国的“援助落后地区”计划上，在美国劳力日益侵入中东近东、英国各自治领及殖民地的威胁上，唐宁街就曾对或正对华尔街表现所谓“有礼貌的反抗”，这两大帝国主义曾为了各自的不名誉的利益，不断发生争吵，甚至在行动上表现某种程度的分歧。但是，帝国主义越是陷入不可解救的经济危机的困难中，就越是增加他们对于和平事业以及对于走上或走向社会主义大道的国家的憎恨。因此美英之间的争吵、分歧和矛盾，并没有松懈他们扩军备战的疯狂竞赛，也不会妨害他们在敌视全世界人民的罪恶事业上，采取着一致的方针。
    从科伦坡会议到曼谷会议
    美英帝国主义者最近在远东的活动，尤其可以生动地说明这一点。
    在日本问题上，英美的政策是有距离的。麦克阿瑟积极扶植日本的军国主义，美国垄断资本侵入了日本工业，直接威胁着英国自治领和殖民地的安全及其商业利益。但在一月十四日结束的科伦坡会议，却在缔结对日和约问题上，重申一九四七年堪培拉会议的“临时结论”，即主张由十一国远东委员会来决定对日和约的内容，抛弃由四国外长会议准备对日和约的程序，以便排斥苏联和新中国，并同意美国“有决定性的发言权”。
    在争取对东南亚各国反动派的领导权上，美英之间也是有矛盾的。由美国策动的“太平洋联盟”与由英国支持的“东南亚集团”迄今尚未具体地在组织上形成起来。但他们已经获得了共同的结论：以“亚洲民族主义”来阻止“东南亚共产主义的发展”。换句话说，就是它们要一起纠合亚洲各国的民族败类，共同对付东南亚人民的解放运动。
    在掠夺东南亚各国的经济控制权上，美英之间是有斗争的，特别是在印度、印尼和泰国。科伦坡会议所讨论的“东南亚经济发展建议”和“不列颠联邦的互助计划”，与美国的“第四点计划”，是有矛盾的。美国统治阶级对于这一点特别敏感。纽约时报和先驱论坛报，一致敦促“美国对不列颠联邦的经济建议和互助计划，全心全意地从事合作”。这就是说，华尔街将加强对于伦敦城的压力，使“东南亚经济发展建议”变成“第四点计划”的一个尾闾。
    贝文在科伦坡会议开幕前，即令驻美大使弗朗克斯于二十三日返英国取关于科伦坡会议的报告，使充分通知艾奇逊。据合众社称：“贝文决心减少在远东问题上与美国的分歧。”帝国主义者不愿承认侵略政策的失败，不愿接受历史的教训，继续进行绝望的挣扎，与远东各国人民为敌。从这一角度来看，科伦坡会议也可以说是不久后将举行的曼谷会议的预备会议。如所周知，曼谷会议是美帝国主义重新布置远东侵略计划的一个重要会议。
