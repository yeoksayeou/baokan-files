Short Commentary:

    For over a decade, the people in the liberated areas, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, have overcome floods, droughts, and other disasters countless times, accumulating considerable experience. In disaster relief work, we have always opposed pessimism, despair, and reliance on others, and we have also opposed bureaucratic work styles. Our general policy for disaster relief has consistently been to lead the affected people to overcome difficulties and engage in self-salvation through production.

    According to reports from various sources, the people in various disaster areas have already achieved considerable success in the struggle for self-salvation through production, under slogans such as "rely on the mountains if you live near the mountains, rely on the water if you live near the water." The example of Wen'an County, Hebei Province, as reported in today's newspaper, where the leadership organized mutual aid among the people to overcome the famine, ensuring that no one starved to death, is a very good one. In leading disaster relief efforts, the Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the Chairman of Hebei Province, among others, personally led work teams to go deep into the grassroots to inspect disaster relief, greatly assisting the work, which is also an excellent example.

    Experience proves that as long as the leading organs at all levels firmly grasp the leadership of disaster relief work, they will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and achieve results. Conversely, if leadership is relaxed, it will inevitably lead to adverse consequences. For example, in Ji County, Hebei, although the masses were organized to manage fish and weave textiles, and people in non-disaster areas were mobilized to donate more than 30,000 jin of rice for disaster relief, the leading cadres of the county harbored thoughts of reliance and waiting, did not think of many solutions, did not delve into the grassroots, and did not summarize experience. As a result, the main cadres of forty villages mostly fled. This was because they initially lacked awareness of the severity of the disaster, and when the disaster became severe, they were overwhelmed by it. This is an unacceptable phenomenon.

    In order to realize the call of the Central People's Government's State Council and the Ministry of Internal Affairs that "no one should be allowed to starve to death," we demand that the leading organs in all disaster areas recognize the seriousness of production for disaster relief work, formulate practical and effective methods for self-salvation through production based on the specific conditions of the locality, firmly grasp leadership, and carry out arduous work to complete the political task of production for disaster relief.

### 抓紧生产救灾的领导

    抓紧生产救灾的领导
    十余年来，解放区的人民在中国共产党和人民政府领导之下曾无数次地战胜过水旱及其他灾害，并取得了不少经验。在救灾工作中，我们从来反对悲观失望、等待依赖的思想，也从来反对官僚主义的作风。我们救灾工作的总方针一向是领导灾民，克服困难生产自救。
    据各方反映，各灾区人民在生产自救的斗争中，在“靠山吃山，靠水吃水”等口号下，已有不少成绩。本报今日所载河北省文安县领导席民互助渡荒，保证了不饿死一个人，是其中一个很好的例子。在救灾工作的领导上，中共热河省委书记及热河省主席等亲自带领工作团深入下层，检查救灾，对救灾工作帮助很大，也是很好的范例。
    经验证明：只要各级领导机关抓紧对救灾工作的领导，就一定能够克服困难，获得成绩。相反的，如果放松领导，必然造成不良结果，例如河北蓟县，那里虽然也组织了群众治鱼和纺织，并发动了非灾区人民捐助了三万多斤救灾米；但是，由于该县领导干部存在着依赖等待思想，不多想办法，不深入下层，不总结经验，因之，就发生了四十个村主要干部大部逃亡的现象。这是由于他们最初对灾情认识不足，到灾情严重时，就被灾情所吓倒；这是不能容许的现象。
    为了实现中央人民政府政务院和内务部“不许饿死一个人”的号召，我们要求各灾区的领导机关，认识生产救灾工作的严重性，根据当地的具体情况，规定切实有效的生产自救的办法，抓紧领导，进行艰巨的工作来完成生产救灾的政治任务。
