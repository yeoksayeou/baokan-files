    Hubei Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department Notice
    Cadre Theory Study
    Regular Notebook Checks and Examinations

    [This Newspaper] The Propaganda Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice on the 5th regarding theoretical study for cadres in active service. It stipulates that cadres at all levels should first study the History of Social Development. County and regiment-level cadres should complete the study in three months (January to March), while district and company-level cadres and below should complete it in six months. The former will focus on self-study, with group discussions once a week; the latter will emphasize both lectures by designated personnel and organized study discussions. The notice points out that administrative leaders should attach importance to leading the study, requiring each cadre to persist in studying for two hours every morning, without doing other work; those who are delayed for special reasons must make up for it at other times; cadres who are away on official business should take time to study on their own, and should not be allowed to drift along under the excuse of official travel. At the same time, regular checks of notebooks will be conducted, and an examination system will be established. After studying each unit, the General Study Committee will issue test questions for an examination. Combined with the appraisal of organ cadres, the results will be evaluated as excellent or poor. Cadres with excellent study results will be rewarded by the General Study Committee.

    湖北省委宣传部通知
    干部学习理论
    定期检查笔记举行测验
    【本报讯】中共湖北省委宣传部于五日发出关于在职干部学习理论的通知。规定各级干部首先学习社会发展史，县团干部三个月（一月至三月）学完，区营以下干部半年学习完毕。前者以自学为主，每周以小组为单位集体讨论一次；后者则专人讲课和组织学习讨论并重。通知中指出行政首长应重视领导学习，要求每个干部必须每天早上坚持学习两小时，不得作其他工作；有特殊原因而耽误者亦必须抽其他时间补上；因公外出之干部，应随时抽空自学，不得借口公出而放任自流。同时定期检查笔记，建立测验制度，每学习一单元，由总学委会出题测验一次，结合机关干部鉴定，评定成绩优劣，学习成绩优良的干部由总学委会予以奖励。
