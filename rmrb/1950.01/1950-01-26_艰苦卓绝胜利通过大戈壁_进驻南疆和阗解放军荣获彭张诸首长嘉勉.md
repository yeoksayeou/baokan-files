Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, January 25th: Generals Peng Dehuai, Zhang Zongxun, Gan Siqi, and Yan Kuiyao of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, on the 13th of this month, sent a telegram to all commanders and soldiers of a certain unit who, braving wind, sand, and severe cold, marched from Aksu in southern Xinjiang, crossed the Great Gobi Desert, and were stationed in Hotan County, a town on the southern end of Xinjiang bordering Tibet. The telegram stated: "Your stationing in Hotan, braving the freezing cold, desolate wilderness, and enduring wind and meals in the open, has created an unprecedented record of advancement. We extend our respects to the glorious soldiers who have struggled arduously and victoriously advanced into Xinjiang." This unit of all commanders and soldiers began their southward march from Aksu in southern Xinjiang on December 5th of last year. Enduring hardship and cold along the way, eating and sleeping in the open, they traveled for eighteen days, marching over 1,500 li, and finally victoriously crossed the largest Great Gobi Desert in the country, arriving in Hotan County on the 22nd of last month. They were warmly welcomed by over 40,000 people from all walks of life and ethnic groups in the local area.
