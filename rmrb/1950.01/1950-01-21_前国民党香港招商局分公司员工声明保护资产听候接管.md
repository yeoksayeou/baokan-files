Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th. Former employees of the Kuomintang reactionary government's Hong Kong China Merchants Bureau issued a statement on January 13th, announcing their uprising and awaiting takeover by the Central People's Government. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    Under the brilliant leadership of Chairman Mao, the entire country has achieved a basic victory, liberating the people oppressed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and giving us new life and freedom. In the past, under the threat and coercion of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the shipping industry was forced to transport troops, forcing kind sailors who had not received military training to the front lines under the pressure of guns, risking their lives and suffering unnecessary sacrifices, constantly being used by the bandit army. Therefore, colleagues of the Hong Kong China Merchants Bureau branch and the sailors of the ships berthed in Hong Kong firmly oppose working for the counter-revolutionary and anti-people bandit party again. A portion of the progressive employees of the branch were secretly convened in Hong Kong in mid-October 1949 to prepare for an uprising, shouldering the task of protecting ships and bureau property. On November 21st of the same year, they were ordered to protect ships and property more effectively and not stage a public uprising. After receiving clear instructions, we resolutely carried out this sacred task, increasing the number of ships berthed in Hong Kong from five to thirteen, and successively returning a portion of the ships under the control of the reactionaries to the people. In this short period, the reactionaries threatened, lured, and exhausted all kinds of conspiracies to force the ships berthed in Hong Kong to go to Taiwan and serve as anti-people tools again. But our sailors did not waver and managed to refuse to sail to Taiwan. Now that the United Kingdom has begun to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and Premier Zhou has issued an order on January 9th to protect state property, we have now preserved all ships, assets, and archives intact, awaiting takeover, returning them to the people, and cooperating with the national transportation industry to serve the people. We swear to work hard under the leadership of Chairman Mao to complete the construction of a new China, and we earnestly hope that colleagues and sailors who are still trapped in Taiwan should quickly distinguish between right and wrong, recognize the future, and no longer be used by the US-Chiang Kai-shek clique, and join the people as soon as possible, either openly or secretly, to liberate Taiwan and achieve the great cause of assisting the national liberation.

    前国民党香港招商局分公司员工声明保护资产听候接管
    【新华社香港二十日电】前国民党反动政府的香港招商局分公司员工于一月十三日发表声明，宣布起义经过并听候中央人民政府接管。声明全文如下：
    全国在毛主席英明的领导下已经取得了基本的胜利，解救了被蒋匪压迫下的人民，使我们得到了新生与自由。航运事业过去被蒋匪的威胁劫持下迫运军队，使未受过军事训练的善良海员们在枪杆的弹压下驶上火线，冒着生命的危险，遭受无谓的牺牲，不断地被匪军所利用。因此，香港招商局分公司的同仁以及泊港船只的海员，坚决的反对再为反革命、反人民的匪党工作，当召集分公司一部分前进员工于一九四九年十月中旬秘密的在香港准备起义，负起保护船只及局产的任务；于同年十一月二十一日奉令为更有效的护船、护产，不作公开起义。我们奉到明确的指示后，坚决的执行这一神圣的工作，使泊港船只由五艘增至十三艘，先后将在反动派控制下的一部分船只归还人民。在这短短的时间，反动派曾威吓、利诱，用尽种种阴谋，逼迫泊港的船只去台湾重作反人民之工具。但我们的海员并未动摇，均经设法拒绝驶往台湾。现在英国与我中华人民共和国开始建立邦交，周总理又有一月九日保护国家财产的命令，我们现已将全部船艇、资产、档案保存无恙，听候接管，归还人民，配合着全国的交通事业，为人民服务。我们宣誓在毛主席的领导下努力完成建设新中国，并切望现在尚被困于台湾的同仁和海员们，应速辨明是非，认清前途，勿再为美蒋所利用，早日投向人民，或作公开或作秘密的配合，解放台湾，以达协助全国解放之宏业。
