Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: The Political Departments of the Northwest Military Region, the First Field Army, and the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army have successively issued directives regarding Spring Festival work. The directive jointly issued by the Northwest Military Region and the Political Department of the First Field Army requires literary and art troupes and propaganda teams of all units to extensively publicize the victorious situation of the national liberation war and the significance of launching the production and construction movement this year to companies, factories, and rural areas. Mass entertainment activities of "soldiers performing for soldiers" should be launched within the companies. Before the Spring Festival, all units should conduct an inspection of the implementation of policies and discipline. If any violations of mass discipline are discovered, apologies and admissions of wrongdoing should be made to the masses separately, and compensation should be made for any damage to the property of the masses. During the Spring Festival, troops must not accept gifts from residents. They should hold get-togethers with landlords, neighbors, and local people of all ethnic groups, extend New Year greetings and condolences to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, provide material assistance to impoverished families of martyrs and military personnel, and extend warm hospitality to the family members of soldiers who come to visit their children in the army. Units participating in agricultural production should invite experienced farmers to hold discussions, consult with them on local agricultural seasons and farming methods, in order to avoid violating the agricultural season in spring plowing.

The Political Department of the Second Field Army has also issued instructions to the entire army on carrying out Spring Festival literary and artistic activities, calling on all units of the army to organize and carry out extensive literary and artistic activities during the Spring Festival. Through this activity, in-depth education on the situation and tasks should be conducted for the troops, and extensive and in-depth publicity should be carried out to the masses. Since the people in the new areas urgently need to understand the current situation and the policies of the People's Government, the focus of Spring Festival work should be on publicity activities for the masses. During the publicity, attention should be paid to the specific circumstances of the city and countryside, and forms familiar to the local people (such as the Sichuan Jinqianban) should be utilized to create new programs that are easily accepted and welcomed by the masses. The internal activities of the troops should be closely integrated with current tasks, and the "soldiers performing for soldiers" movement should be launched. The directive requires propaganda departments at all levels to strengthen leadership over Spring Festival literary and artistic activities, mobilize the writing of literary and entertainment materials, and summarize experience and conduct awards after the activities are completed, so that the army's literary and artistic work can be improved through Spring Festival activities.

    一、二野战军指示春节工作
    【新华社北京二十七日电】人民解放军西北军区、第一野战军及第二野战军政治部相继发布关于春节工作的指示。西北军区和第一野战军政治部联合发布的指示中，要求各部队文工队、宣传队到连队、工厂和农村广泛宣传全国解放战争胜利形势，和今年开展生产建设运动的意义。连队中应展开“兵演兵”的群众性娱乐活动。在春节前各部应将政策纪律执行情况作一次检查，如发现违犯群众纪律的事情，要分别向群众道歉、认错，损坏了群众的东西要赔偿。春节中部队不得接受居民群众送礼，并应与房东邻居及当地各族人民举行联欢会，向革命烈士家属和军人家属拜年慰问，对贫苦的烈士家属和军人家属予以物质帮助，对来部队探望子弟的军人家属，应予以热情招待。参加农业生产的单位，应邀请有经验的农民座谈，向他们请教当地农业节令和农作法，以求不违农时进行春耕。
    第二野战军政治部，亦已向全军发出开展春节文艺活动的指示，号召全军各部在春节中组织开展广泛的文艺活动，通过这一活动向部队作深入的形势与任务的教育，向群众进行广泛深入的宣传。由于新区人民急需了解当前形势和人民政府的政策，春节工作重点应放在对群众的宣传活动上。宣传时应根据城市与乡村具体对象，善于利用当地人民所熟悉的形式（如四川金钱板），创作易为群众接受和欢迎的新节目。部队内部的活动和当前任务紧密结合，开展“兵演兵”运动。指示要求各级宣传部门加强对春节文艺活动的领导，发动编写文娱材料。活动结束后总结经验，进行评奖，使部队文艺工作经过春节活动提高一步。
