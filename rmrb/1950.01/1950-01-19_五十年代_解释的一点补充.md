    A Supplement to the Explanation of "The Fifties"
    Xiang Jinjiang
    We mistakenly took 1940-1949 as the fifties, probably because 1900-2000 is not called the nineteenth century, but the twentieth century. People generally follow the ordinal number of the century and use it to calculate the decade, which leads to errors.
    Now there is a question of what to call the years 1900-1909 in terms of decade. Last night, while preparing Chinese language teaching materials, I looked at Qu Qiubai's "Hai Shang Su Lin" and found a translator's note on page 526 of the first volume, "Gorky's Theory of Culture." I am now copying it below to give friends who are unclear about this issue a better understanding, and also as a supplement to Mr. Song Yunbin's opinion.
    "The nineties refer to the 1890s of the nineteenth century, while the 'nine hundreds' refer to the 1900s of the twentieth century."
    According to this note, 1900-1909 should be called the "nine hundreds."

    “五十年代”解释的一点补充
    向锦江
    我们误将一九四○——一九四九当着五十年代，原因恐怕是由于一九○○——二○○○不称为十九世纪，却叫二十世纪，一般人便是准世纪的序数例，而用来计算年代，于是就发生错误了。
    现在有个问题是一九○○——一九○九这几年在年代上该怎么称呼？昨晚因为准备国文教材翻看瞿秋白的《海上述林》在上卷第五二六页“高尔基的文化论”中有一条译者小注，我现在抄在下面，使得对这个问题不明了的朋友多些了解，同时，也算对宋云彬先生意见的一点补充吧。
    “九十年代是十九世纪的一千八百九十几年，而‘九百年代’是二十世纪的一千九百零几年。”
    根据这个注释，一九○○——一九○九应该叫做“九百年代”。
