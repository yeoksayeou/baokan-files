    Youth League Members of Shijingshan Power Plant and Two Other Factories
    Develop Personal Production Plans
    Rapidly Increase Production Efficiency
    Municipal Communist Youth League Committee Calls for Promotion of This Method
    [Beijing News] Youth League members of Shijingshan Power Plant, China People's Printing Factory, and Beijing Garment Factory have achieved great results and created preliminary experience by using the method of developing personal production plans to improve production efficiency and ensure the completion of tasks. The Youth Workers Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League held an expanded cadre meeting of the Youth League branches of various public factories on the 22nd to summarize this experience and called on factories to promote this work. Representatives from the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Factory Branch Section of the Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the heads of the Communist Party branches and trade unions of major public factories were invited to attend the meeting. At the meeting, the process of developing personal production plans by the Youth League members of Shijingshan Power Plant, China People's Printing Factory, and Beijing Garment Factory was first reported. When the Youth League General Branch of Shijingshan Power Plant was rushing to repair No. 6 machine and overhaul No. 14 boiler in mid-October last year, they first implemented this method on a trial basis in the repair unit's Youth League branch, and quickly saw results. Youth League member Zhang Yinchun carefully calculated and allocated his working time, increasing the production of chain shafts from seven or eight per day to fifteen. Liu Zhongkui and Zheng Wenhua cooperated and produced more than sixty pieces per day. Thanks to the efforts of Youth League members and all workers, they completed half a month's task in seven days. In December, when overhauling No. 13 boiler, the work of developing personal plans was extended to three Youth League branches. Youth League members took the initiative to contact the administration to understand the entire overhaul plan and widely solicit the opinions of master workers and foremen, determining that the focus of the plan was to improve quality and learn technology. To make the plan practical and specific, Youth League members first developed their own plans based on the quality of tools and materials, technical level, and other conditions, and then held a meeting for public discussion. For example, one Youth League member's plan was to "learn all about Boiler No. 13 within a month," but Boiler No. 13 was extremely complex, and it was impossible to learn everything in a month, so he was criticized and advised by everyone, and helped him to revise his plan. Youth League member Wang Deyi was praised for developing a plan to learn copper welding and save oxygen rods based on his own ability. After developing these plans, these Youth League members achieved considerable success in learning technology and saving production costs. Youth League members of the China People's Printing Factory improved their skills by developing personal production plans. For example, in the intaglio printing unit, it was previously necessary to stop the machine when changing wet cloths and flannel cloths, but now they can do it without stopping the machine, which resulted in the output exceeding the standards set by the administration. Moreover, there were no rejected prints in January, reducing the waste rate. After the Youth League members of the second shift of the Beijing Garment General Factory developed personal production plans, they came up with various ways to improve their own operations. Gui Rongzhen used to have to stop the machine twelve times to make one piece, but after developing a plan, she has reduced it to eight times, increasing the output by 40%. In the printing factory and garment factory, Youth League members not only developed their own personal production plans, but also motivated other workers to develop plans.
    Yang Bozhen, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, summarized the initial experience of this work at the meeting, stating that the basic task of the factory's Youth League is to serve production, and the development of personal production plans by Youth League members is an important method for the Youth League to ensure the completion of administrative production plans. The Youth League's work, combined with this work, has solved many specific problems: (1) Youth League members have improved their awareness and enthusiasm in production, have specific goals to strive for, and can easily discover and overcome their shortcomings in production work. (2) The contradiction between Youth League activities and production work has been resolved. At the Youth League小组 meeting, Youth League members said, "This time we have something to talk about." This has made the Youth League's life have concrete and lively content, and the Youth League's propaganda and education, development, and consolidation of organizational work have all become easier. (3) The relationship between the Youth League and the administration and master workers has been further strengthened. The administration feels that the Youth League is its capable assistant, and the master workers know that these young people are on the right path and learning well. (4) The Youth League's leadership work has been greatly deepened compared to before, paying attention to studying the problems in the production process. In his summary report, Yang Bozhen also pointed out that in order for this work to be sustainable and widely developed, it must be coordinated with the Party, government, and trade unions to overcome the following three weaknesses: (1) It is not widespread enough, and is not carried out from top to bottom in coordination with the Party, government, and trade unions. (2) It is not linked to appropriate management systems and wage systems (such as excess rewards). (3) The content of the plan is too much, emphasizing labor intensity and discipline, and not enough is done to improve technology. In the future, in the three units that have already implemented personal production plans, we should take another step forward, so that Youth League members clearly understand the significance of this work, the plans should be more specific, we should pay attention to propaganda and mobilization, and strengthen technical learning. Other factories should learn from the experience of these three units, and first conduct a focused trial within the factory, and then promote this work.

    石景山发电厂等三厂青年团员
    制定个人生产计划
    迅速提高生产效率
    团市工委号召推广这一办法
    【北京讯】石景山发电厂、中国人民印刷厂和北京被服厂三厂的青年团员，用订个人生产计划的方法来提高生产效率、保证完成任务，获得很大成绩，并创造了初步经验，青年团北京市工作委员会青工委员会，特于二十二日，召开各公营工厂团支部扩大干部会议，总结这一经验，并号召各厂推广这一工作。会中并邀请市总工会筹委会，中共北京市委组织部工厂支部科，各大公营工厂中共支部及工会负责人参加。会上，首先报告了石景山发电厂、中国人民印刷厂、北京被服厂三个单位青年团员订个人生产计划的经过。石景山发电厂青年团总支，在去年十月中旬，抢修六号机和大修十四号锅炉时，先在修理股青年团分支试行这个办法，很快就见到效果。团员张荫春仔细地计算和分配了工作时间，使链子轴的产量从每天做七八根提高到十五根。刘钟骙和郑文华两人分工合作，每天出到六十根以上。由于团员和全体工人的努力，七天就完成了半个月的任务。十二月里，大修十三号炉时，订个人计划的工作推广到三个团支部，团员们主动地和行政上取得联系，了解整个检修计划，并广泛征求老师傅、领班的意见，决定计划重心是提高质量和学习技术，为使计划订的切实具体，团员根据工具材料好坏，技术水平等条件，先自订计划，再开会公议。如一个团员订的计划是“一个月内学会全部十三号锅炉”，但十三号炉极复杂，一个月内全部学会是不可能的，因此受到大家的批评劝导，并帮助他重订。团员王德有根据自己能力，订出学会焊铜活，节省氧气棍，受到表扬。这些团员订出计划后，在学习技术和生产节约方面，都收到不少成绩。中国人民印刷厂团员通过订个人生产计划，提高了技术，如凹印股以前换湿布和绒布时，必须先停机器，现在可以不停机器，因之使产量超过了行政上规定的标准。而且一月份已经没有倒票，减少了作废率。北京被服总厂二班团员订个人生产计划后，想出各种改进自己操作的方法，桂荣珍以前做一件活时要停机器十二次，经过订计划后，已减少至八次，使产量提高了百分之四十。在印刷厂和被服厂里，团员不只自己订了个人生产计划，还带动别的工人也订了计划。
    青年团市工委副书记杨伯箴在会上总结了这一工作的初步经验，说明工厂团的基本任务是为生产服务，团员订个人生产计划是团保证完成行政生产计划的重要方法。团的工作结合了这个工作，使许多具体问题得到了解决：（一）团员在生产上提高了自觉性与积极性，有了具体的奋斗目标，容易发现和克服自己在生产工作中的缺点。（二）解决了团务活动与生产工作的矛盾，在团小组会上讨论生产，团员说：“这回可有话说了。”使团的生活有具体生动的内容，团的宣传教育、发展和巩固组织工作都好办了。（三）进一步密切团与行政及老师傅间的关系，行政感到团是自己的得力助手，老师傅们知道了这些年青人在走正道、学好。（四）团的领导工作得以较前大大深入一步，注意钻研生产过程中的问题。杨伯箴在总结报告中同时指出：为使这一工作能持久和得到广泛的开展，必须与党、政、工配合，设法克服以下三个弱点：（一）不够广泛，不是从上而下与党、政、工协同一致进行的。（二）没有和适当的管理制度、工资制度（如超额奖励等）联系起来。（三）计划内容多，强调劳动强度和纪律，对提高技术一点做的不够。今后，在已经实行订个人生产计划的三个单位里，应再提高一步，使团员明确了解这项工作的意义，计划订的要更具体，注意宣传鼓动工作，加强技术学习。其他工厂，应该吸取这三个单位的经验，在厂内先有重点的试行，然后再推广这项工作。
