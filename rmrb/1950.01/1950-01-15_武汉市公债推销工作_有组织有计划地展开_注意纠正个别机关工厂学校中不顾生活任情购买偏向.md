Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 14th: The promotion of the Wuhan City People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds is unfolding in an organized and planned manner. After the Wuhan City All-Circles Representative Conference initially consulted and passed the subscription figures for all sectors of the city, and the Municipal People's Government approved it, various institutions and organizations actively deployed their work to complete and exceed their tasks as soon as possible. In terms of employees, from the 5th to the 12th, in eight days, more than 80,000 shares have been subscribed, completing more than one-third of the 220,000 shares allocated by the All-Circles Representative Conference Consultation Committee. The women's sector has already allocated the task of subscribing 10,000 shares to its subordinate sales teams on the 12th. Chen Jingyu, the person in charge of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and others are full of confidence in the 5 million share subscription task assigned to the industrial and commercial circles by the Consultation Committee, and are determined to mobilize industrialists and businessmen to learn from the patriotic spirit of workers and soldiers. At present, the industrial and commercial sales committees and groups are brewing specific sharing figures for each industry to achieve greater fairness and rationality.

Since the end of December last year, Wuhan City has established sales work organizations at all levels from top to bottom. In order to make everyone understand the significance of issuing public bonds and actively purchase them, the Municipal Public Bond Committee decided that the first step is to conduct extensive publicity and mobilization. The Municipal Public Bond Publicity Committee specifically stipulated that January 11th to 17th is Public Bond Publicity Week. On the 11th and 12th, the Zhongyuan University Propaganda Team and famous Peking Opera actors Chen Hefeng, Gao Baisui, and Li Wanchun dressed up and paraded for street propaganda. Factories and schools also expanded propaganda in the form of street speeches, comics, and dramas. The Yangtze River Daily, Dagang Daily, Central China Workers, Hubei Farmers, and other newspapers also published special issues to cooperate with the propaganda. During Public Bond Publicity Week, the People's Education Center decided to organize a slide show team to show slides everywhere. The reading room of the center also displayed documents, clippings, and blackboard questions and answers related to public bond issues for citizens to read.

In the subscription campaigns of institutions, schools, and factories, a few units, due to lack of attention, produced inappropriate challenge competitions, which led some people to purchase bonds imprudently out of patriotic enthusiasm, affecting family life. This has now attracted the attention and correction of various leading organs.

    武汉市公债推销工作
    有组织有计划地展开
    注意纠正个别机关工厂学校中不顾生活任情购买偏向
    【新华社汉口十四日电】武汉市人民胜利折实公债的推销工作正有组织有计划地展开。在全市各界认购数字由市各界代表会首次协商会协商通过并经市人民政府批准后，各机关、团体即分头积极布置工作，争取早日完成并超过任务。职工方面从五日到十二日的八天中，已认购八万多分，完成各界代表会协商委员会分配的二十二万分的三分之一以上。妇女界已于十二日将认购一万分的任务分配给所属各推销小组。工商联合会筹委会负责人陈经畲等，对协商委员会分配给工商界五百万分的认购任务，满怀信心，决心要动员工商业者向工人、战士们的爱国精神看齐。现工商业推销委员会及小组正在酝酿各行业具体分担数字，以求得更加公平合理。
    自去年十二月下旬开始，武汉市即自上而下地建立了各级推销工作机构。为使人人懂得发行公债的意义并踊跃购买，市公债委员会决定第一步工作是广泛地进行宣传动员。市公债宣传委员会具体规定本月十一日至十七日为公债宣传周。十一、十二两日，中原大学宣传队及京剧名演员陈鹤峰、高百岁、李万春等均化装游行作街头宣传，工厂、学校亦以街头演讲、漫画、戏剧等形式扩大宣传。长江日报、大刚报、华中工人、湖北农民等报并出特刊配合宣传。民教馆在公债宣传周内，决定组织幻灯放映队到各处放映。该馆阅览室并陈列了有关公债问题的文件、剪报、及黑板问答供市民阅览。
    在机关、学校、工厂的认购运动中，个别单位由于未注意掌握，产生了不适当的挑战比赛，致有些人激于爱国热情，任情购买，影响家庭生活，现已引起各领导机关的注意和纠正。
