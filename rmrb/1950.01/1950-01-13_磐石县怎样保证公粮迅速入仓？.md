    How Does Panshi County Ensure Rapid Grain Delivery to Granaries?
    Liu Jie
    Panshi County, Jilin Province, Northeast China, started delivering grain on November 28th of last year. By December 19th, it had completed 95.7% of the county's task (calculated according to the provincial assignment). More than 5,000 tons of soybeans have been delivered, exceeding the task assigned by the province. The county's grain delivery is nearing completion. The following is an introduction to the grain delivery work in Panshi County:
            Ensuring Good Grain Delivery
    The quality of soybeans in Panshi County this year is not very good, with many insect-infested and broken soybeans. The government called for delivering more soybeans and ensuring the completion of the task. Under these circumstances, the county specifically studied this issue at the district representative and grain assistant meetings. Finally, it was decided that cadres in each district should conduct repeated publicity among the masses, explaining the benefits of delivering soybeans to the country and the people, and advocating the delivery of high-quality grain. After the district and village cadres conducted in-depth publicity, the peasants generally realized the importance of delivering soybeans and launched a surge of sun-drying, airing, winnowing, and exchanging for good grain. In particular, Party members played a promoting role. For example, the secretary of the Solidarity Village branch, because his own beans were not good, exchanged them for good beans from elsewhere. After the exchange, he was still afraid that they would not meet the standards, so he sifted them again and winnowed them again, removing two and a half dou of insect-infested, broken, and small soybeans from one shi and three dou of beans, promoting the masses in the entire village to busy themselves with sifting, winnowing, and winnowing, creating a high tide of fine selection of soybeans. The other public grains were also generally selected in this way. In order to ensure the delivery of good grain, women and children first inspected it before loading the carts; after loading, the village cadres conducted a re-inspection, comparing it with the grain samples. If anything substandard was found, they immediately took action to tidy it up, ensuring that every cart delivered was accepted.
            Relatively Sound Transportation Organization
    Before starting grain delivery, each district was almost organized into large cart teams based on villages. The best job was done in the Yantongshan area, where they followed the planned schedule, delivering quickly and unloading quickly, completing the district's task in four days. Conversely, if the Jichang district did not follow the plan, the grain carts were disorganized and scattered, creating confusion in the transportation organization. After the county discovered this situation, on the one hand, it helped to correct it, and at the same time, it communicated the grain delivery experience of these two districts to all districts, promoting active grain delivery throughout the county. Solidarity Village in Chaoyangshan area accepted this experience and immediately organized 62 large carts. A group leader was selected for every five carts to be responsible for supervising loading, feeding horses, and harnessing carts. A model militiaman was selected to be responsible for maintaining order and lining up carts at the grain station; each village also selected a captain to count the number of carts, grain, and grain owners in the village, register with the farmers' association, and the farmers' association would then collect the statistics from each village and report them to the district, and the district would then report them to the county and the grain station (so that the grain station could prepare its forces in advance); each village would also select a large captain to cooperate with the village chairman to be responsible for contacting and commanding the carts, planning when to leave, where to gather, and after arriving at the grain station, also responsible for weighing, counting, and going through the procedures and settling accounts and receiving freight charges with the district representatives. Grain delivery was signaled by ringing a bell. The first bell (11:00 p.m.) signaled feeding the horses, the second bell signaled eating, and the third bell (2:00 a.m.) signaled harnessing the carts and leaving. Each trip delivered the same kind of grain to avoid trouble during grain collection.
            High Peasant Morale, Launching Competition
    Because the preparatory work was done well, the autumn tax policy was implemented, and the past deviations of uneven distribution of burdens were corrected, the morale of the peasants in the county was particularly high, and they all realized that "we must not forget our roots after turning over." For example, some peasants reflected: "Even if we harvest more grain, the government doesn't ask for more public grain, and those who suffer from disasters are even given reductions and exemptions. We deliver whatever we plant, and soybeans are even converted into other grains. The government takes such good care of us. If we don't deliver good grain, we would be letting the government down!" Therefore, each district, village, township, and even household launched a competition to deliver grain and strive to be models. After Solidarity Village and Yibuling Village challenged each other, the original plan was to complete the delivery in four days, but they completed the task in two days (five days earlier than last year's grain delivery). Old Baitou of Solidarity Village happily said: "I have lived for more than seventy years, and I have never seen such a large cart team. This is the establishment of the new China, and everything has changed!"
            Strengthening Warehouse Work
    Thanks to the efforts of all the staff, the warehouses and grain stations in various places have also accelerated the time for grain delivery. Take the Panshi Warehouse as an example. The warehouse only has fourteen cadres and six scales, and it receives more than 900,000 jin of grain (more than 600 carts) every day, yet it is still quite calm. Last year, the warehouse had more than thirty cadres, and it took them from morning till night to receive only 500,000 jin of grain. The warehouse's receiving speed this year is twice as fast as last year, and the receiving quantity has also increased by one-third compared with last year. The warehouse can achieve these results mainly due to the following reasons: ① The warehouse and the districts are well-integrated: each district sends a notice the night before the number of carts to be sent, the type of grain (the same type of grain is sent each time), and the quantity, and the warehouse will arrange its receiving forces according to this notice. When the carts arrive, they are immediately unloaded, without any delay. ② The relationship between the district representatives and the warehouse cadres is good: the district representatives stationed in the warehouse, like the warehouse staff, do whatever work is needed, and can explain the policies to the grain-delivering masses. For example, the representative of Jiangnan District helps the warehouse to issue receipts, review receipts and freight bills when they are not busy; the representative of Donglai District patiently persuades the peasants if there is a problem with the quality of grain in the district, and compares it with the standard grain samples of the district, so that the peasants are satisfied and express that they will send better grain, which greatly facilitates the receiving work. ③ The work is orderly: in addition to being maintained and taken care of by their own responsible persons, the warehouse accountant and freight payment personnel also help the grain carts to line up, marking the numbers with chalk, and the grain inspectors check according to the numbers. ④ Clear division of labor and close contact, establishing a special responsibility system: the warehouse has six scales, with six grain inspectors responsible for weighing and counting the grain tickets, and checking the numbers with the district representatives and grain accountants in the evening; two grain inspectors, one responsible for checking sorghum and corn, and the other for checking millet and rice; the grain accountant and the three freight payment personnel are responsible for calculating freight and disbursing cash, and helping to line up in the morning when they are not busy (reducing two accountants and two guides); one announcer is responsible for broadcasting grain delivery information and grain delivery knowledge, writing blackboard newspapers, publicizing grain collection policies, etc.; and another person is responsible for weighing and giving grain to the railway bureau and handling procedures; in addition, there is a director. The whole warehouse has a clear division of labor and each is responsible for their own duties. ⑤ The organization of the porters is good, accelerating the efficiency of unloading grain: this year, each scale is equipped with seven to fifteen porters to help weigh, unwrap the bags, and unload the grain onto the grain pile, unloading one cart (1,500 jin) in three minutes, and unloading twenty carts (30,000 jin) per hour. Calculating eight hours a day, a total of 240,000 jin can be unloaded. Although the masses bear a little expense (ten yuan per jin of grain), they all think it is very appropriate, and they only need to record the grain numbers and manage the bags, which is both convenient and fast.

    磐石县怎样保证公粮迅速入仓？
    刘洁
    东北吉林磐石县从去年十一月二十八日开始送粮，到十二月十九日，已经完成全县任务百分之九十五点七（按省布置任务数计算），大豆送完五千多吨，已超过省给的任务。全县送粮已接近结束。现将磐石县的送粮工作情况介绍如下：
            保证交好粮
    磐石县今年的大豆质量很不好，虫口和破半豆挺多，政府号召要多交大豆，并要保证完成任务。在这种情况下，县里曾在区代表及粮食助理会上专门研究了这个问题，最后决定各区干部向群众进行反复的宣传，说明交大豆对国家、对人民的好处，并提倡交上等粮。会后经过区、村干部的深入宣传，农民普遍认识到交大豆的重要性，展开了晒粮、晾粮、溜粮及兑换好粮的热潮，特别是党员起了推动作用，如团结村支书，因为自己的豆子不好，就和别处换好豆子，换来以后还怕不合格，又筛了一遍，溜了一遍，一石三斗豆子又过出去二斗半的虫口，破半豆和小粒豆，推动了全屯群众都忙着筛、簸、溜，造成精选大豆的高潮；别的公粮也大致是这样精选的。为了保证交好粮，在装车以前先由妇女、儿童检查一遍；装车以后再由村干部进行复查，按着粮样子对比，发现有不合格的马上就动手收拾，保证了送一车收一车。
            运输组织比较健全
    开始送粮以前，各区差不多都是以村为单位组织起来大车队，做的最好的就是烟筒山区，都按预定计划办事，送的快、卸的快，全区四天完成任务；相反的，如吉昌区不按计划办事，粮车没有秩序，零零星星，造成了运输组织上的混乱现象。县里发现这种情形以后，一方面帮助进行纠正，同时就把这两个区的送粮经验通报各区，推动全县积极送粮。朝阳山区团结村接受了这个经验，马上组织起来六十二台大车，每五台车选出一名组长，负责督促装车、喂马和套车等，再选一名模范自卫队员，负责到粮站维持秩序和排车；每屯再选一名队长，统计全屯的车数、粮数、粮主等，拿到农会登记，农会再集中各屯的统计，头天晚间报区，区再报县和粮站（使粮站事先准备力量）；各村再选一名大队长，配合村主席负责联系和指挥大车，计划什么时候走，到什么地方集中，到粮站以后还要负责过秤、记数，和区代表办手续、算账、领运费。送粮以打钟为号，头遍钟（夜间十一点）喂马，二遍钟吃饭，三遍钟（过半夜两点）套车走。每趟都是送一样的粮食，免去收粮时麻烦。
            农民情绪高，展开竞赛
    因为事先准备工作做的好，贯彻了秋征政策，纠正了过去苦乐不均的偏差，全县农民的送粮情绪特别高，都认识到“翻身不能忘本”。如有的农民反映：多打了粮政府也不多要公粮，受灾的还给减免，种啥就交啥，交大豆还给折合，政府照顾的真周到，咱们若不交好粮，也对不起政府哇！因此各区、村、屯以至于户，都展开了比赛送粮争模范的运动。团结村和一步岭村挑战以后，原定计划四天送完，结果两天完成任务（比去年送粮提前五天），团结屯的老白头高兴的说：“我活了七十多岁，从来也没看见过这样多的车队，这可是成立了新中国，什么都变了！”
            加强了仓库工作
    各地仓库和粮站，由于全体人员工作的努力，也加速了送粮时间。就拿磐石仓库来说吧，该仓库一共才有十四个干部，六台秤，每天接收九十多万斤粮（六百多车），还挺从容；去年该库三十多干部，一天从早到黑才接五十多万斤粮。该库今年接收速度上比去年快了两倍，接收数量也比去年增加了三分之一。该库能做出这些成绩，主要的有以下几点原因：①仓库和各区结合的好：各区要送的车数、粮种（一趟都送一样粮）、数量，在头天晚上就送来通知，仓库也就根据这个通知布置接收力量，车来到以后，马上就卸完，一点也不耽误。②区代表和仓库干部的关系好：驻在仓库的区代表，和仓库人员一样，遇到什么活就干什么活，并能向送粮群众解释政策，如江南区代表，没事时就帮着仓库开票子，审核收据和运费传票；东来区代表遇到该区有个别粮质不太好的，就耐心的说服农民，并拿出本区的标准粮样子比较，使该农民满意的表示再送好粮，给接收工作很大的便利。③工作有秩序：送粮大车除由自己的负责人维持照顾以外，仓库会计和付运费人员也来帮助粮车排号，用粉笔画上号数，验粮人就按号检查。④分工明确联系紧密，建立专责制：仓库六台秤，有六个检斤员，负责过秤和统计粮票，晚上就和区代表、粮食会计等对照数目；验粮人二名，一名负责检查高粱、苞米，另一名检查谷子和稻子；粮食会计和付运费的三个人，负责计算运费和出纳现款，早晨活不忙就帮着排号（减少了两名会计和两名向导）；广播员一名，负责广播送粮动态和送粮常识，写黑板报，宣传征粮政策等；发粮人一名，负责过秤给铁路局的粮食和办理手续；另外还有主任一名。全库分工明确，各负专责。⑤扛力组织的好，加速卸粮效率：今年每台秤配备了七名到十五名扛力，帮助过秤、拆袋口、往粮堆卸粮，三分钟就能卸一车（一千五百斤）一小时卸二十台车（三万斤），每天按八小时计算，一共能卸二十四万斤，群众虽然负担一点花费（每斤粮十元钱），但都认为很合适，光管记记粮数和经管一下袋子就行，既省事又快当。
