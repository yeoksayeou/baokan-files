Datong Coal Mine's Production Plan for Next Year
Average Daily Coal Production to Exceed Two Thousand Tons

[This newspaper dispatch] Datong Coal Mine, a well-known mine in North China with the most abundant reserves, has formulated its production plan for 1950. The plan includes restoring equipment and strengthening water drainage. It is planned to restore five mines next year, focusing on the Yongdingzhuang, Meikou, and Xinzhouyao mines, and establish a mechanized mine as a demonstration, implementing a strategy of using small mines to support large mines, accelerating the development of large mines. Based on the conditions of each mine, it is planned that the entire mine will produce an average of 2,266 tons of coal per day next year. To complete the above tasks, the plan stipulates strengthening employee education, enhancing worker unity while improving production; among staff, changing their attitudes of belittling labor and having a hiring mentality, strengthening education on employee solidarity, and changing employee relations. It also requires strengthening cadres' professional, political, and cultural learning, overcoming the current situation of cadres being uneasy about their work. Currently, the mine suffers from low production efficiency and waste, mainly due to the unreasonable use of labor and egalitarianism in wages. Furthermore, leadership has failed to organize workers to learn new technologies to improve their skills. The plan stipulates that in 1950, a rational labor organization and a wage system based on work performance must be implemented, and the learning of new technologies must be promoted. In 1950, a democratic movement will be launched, conducting criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom, thereby improving the relationship between leaders and the masses, employee relations, and Party-masses relations. This should instill a sense of ownership in employees, unleash their labor enthusiasm, and jointly manage the mine. Additionally, inspection and reward systems will be established.

The plan also includes specific provisions for the tasks in the next four months. In December, an employee representative conference or workers' congress will be held, and workers will be basically organized by the end of the month, establishing a general trade union. In January of next year, a management committee and a rationalization proposal committee will be established. In February and March, production issues and wage issues will be resolved (generally no changes, but individual adjustments). After March, production competitions will be launched to welcome "May Day" Labor Day.

    大同煤矿明年生产计划
    平均每日将产煤二千余吨
    【本报讯】华北著名藏量最丰的大同煤矿，已制定一九五○年的生产计划。计划中包括恢复设备、加强抽水；计划在明年恢复五个矿，以永定庄、煤口、忻州窑三矿为主，并建立一机器化的矿山作为示范，实行以小矿养大矿，加速大矿的发展；并根据各矿情况，计划明年全矿平均日产煤二千二百六十六吨。为了完成上述任务，计划中规定加强职工教育，在把生产搞好的精神下，加强工人团结；在职员中，要改变他们的轻视劳动和雇佣观念，加强职工团结的教育，改变职工关系。加强干部业务、政治、文化学习，克服干部目前不安心工作的状况。目前该矿存在着生产效率低和浪费现象，其原因主要由于劳动力的使用不合理，工资上的平均主义，领导上未能组织工人学习新的技术，使技术提高一步。计划中规定，在一九五○年，必需实行合理的劳动组织，和按劳付酬的工资制，提倡学习新技术。并在一九五○年开展民主运动，自上而下的进行批评与自我批评，从而改善领导与群众关系，职工关系和党群关系。使职工树立主人翁思想，发挥劳动热情，共同管理矿山。并建立检查、评奖等制度。
    对于今后四个月的任务，计划中亦有具体规定，在十二月份要召开职工代表大会或工人大会，月底把工人基本上组织起来，成立总工会。明年一月份成立管理委员会和合理化建议委员会。二、三月份解决生产问题、工资问题（现一般不动，个别调整）。三月份以后开展生产竞赛，迎接“五一”劳动节。
