    Zhou Enlai Sends Note to the United Nations
    I have Appointed Zhang Wentian as Chief Representative to the United Nations
    Requests Romulo and Lie to Reply Promptly: When will the illegal representatives of the remnant bandits be expelled, and when can our delegation attend UN meetings and participate in its work?
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 19th] Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, today sent a note to Mr. Romulo, President of the United Nations General Assembly, and Mr. Lie, Secretary-General, on behalf of the People's Republic of China. The full text is as follows: Mr. Romulo, President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Lie, Secretary-General, and please forward to the delegations of all member states of the United Nations and the Security Council:
    On January 8, 1950, I sent a note to the United Nations requesting the United Nations and the Security Council to expel the illegal representatives of the reactionary remnant group of the Chinese Kuomintang. Mr. Lie replied to this protest note, stating that it had been received and forwarded to the member states of the Security Council.
    Now I further notify you, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary-General, that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has appointed Zhang Wentian as the chief representative of the delegation of the People's Republic of China to attend United Nations meetings and participate in the work of the United Nations, including meetings and work of the Security Council.
    I also request you, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary-General, to answer my following two questions, namely:
    (1) When will the illegal representatives of the reactionary remnant group of the Chinese Kuomintang be expelled from the United Nations and its Security Council? I believe that it is completely unreasonable for such illegal representatives of reactionary remnant groups to remain in the United Nations and its Security Council, and they should be expelled immediately.
    (2) When can the legitimate delegation of the People's Republic of China, with Zhang Wentian as its chief representative, attend the meetings of the United Nations and its Security Council and participate in its work? I believe that they should attend the meetings and participate in the work promptly.
    I hope for a prompt reply to the above matters.
                    Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
                                              January 19, 1950

    周外长照会联合国
    我已任命张闻天为出席联合国首席代表
    要求罗慕洛、赖伊速复：何时开除残匪非法代表，我国代表团何时可出席联合国会议并参加工作。
    【新华社北京十九日电】中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来今日代表中华人民共和国向联合国大会主席罗慕洛和秘书长赖伊发出照会一件，全文如下：联合国大会主席罗慕洛先生、秘书长赖伊先生并请转达联合国及安全理事会各会员国代表团：
    一九五○年一月八日我曾向联合国发出照会，要求联合国及安全理事会将中国国民党反动残余集团的非法代表予以开除，此抗议照会已承赖伊先生复电表示收到并转达安全理事会各会员国。
    现在我再通知你们，主席先生和秘书长先生，中华人民共和国中央人民政府业已任命张闻天为中华人民共和国出席联合国会议和参加联合国工作、包括安全理事会的会议及其工作的代表团的首席代表。
    我并要求你们，主席先生和秘书长先生，回答我的下列两个问题，即：
    （一）何时开除中国国民党反动残余集团的非法代表出联合国及其安全理事会。我认为这样的反动残余集团的非法代表到现在还这样留在联合国及其安全理事会，是完全不合理的，应当立即开除出去。
    （二）以张闻天为首席代表的合法的中华人民共和国的代表团，何时可以出席联合国及其安全理事会的会议并参加工作。我认为应当迅速出席会议并参加工作。
    以上各项，请予速复为盼。
                    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来
                                              一九五○年一月十九日
