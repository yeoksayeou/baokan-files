    Cultivating a Model Team to Drive the Entire Factory
    Clothing Factory's Output Doubles
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Clothing Factory has achieved great success in cultivating a model team to drive production and improve technology. The daily output of summer uniforms has increased from 2.5 sets to 5 sets, and some have even reached 6 sets. The workers' enthusiasm for production is high, and they are brewing a large-scale competition campaign. Since the factory began producing summer uniforms in mid-December last year, the output has been poor because this year's summer uniform styles are more complex and difficult to make, and the workers' skills were not proficient enough to meet production standards. As a result, workers' wage income decreased, and morale was once low. After the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League discovered this, they immediately grasped the problem and tried to help the workers overcome difficulties. They planned to cultivate model teams, using one factory and two teams as a typical experiment to gain experience in order to promote it throughout the factory and improve production standards. In the experimental class, labor models and Party and League members took the lead in organizing technical research groups, using rest time to study and improve methods based on the general difficulties and the returned products, such as how to open the collar and how to dig pockets. After reaching a consensus, it was promoted to other machinists and assistant workers. Initially, only twenty-nine machinists and assistant workers participated, but later, due to the achievements of the research, all machinists and assistant workers in the class were involved in the technical research upsurge. At this time, each group also combined its own specific situation not only to continue research work, but also to formulate daily production plans and implement a merit-based system, publishing the output of each group and the returned (substandard) products on the wall every day. Encouraged by the competition, the workers in each group urged each other to step up production and strive for good results for their group. From the 13th, everyone formulated their own daily production plans, and most of them completed them ahead of schedule. Based on the experience of the second team, other teams also automatically organized and challenged each other. Now the factory is about to launch a large-scale production competition between teams and between factories to ensure the victorious completion of the summer uniform production task.

    培养典型班推动全厂
    被服厂产量提高一倍
    【北京讯】北京被服厂培养典型班带动生产、改进技术，已获很大成绩，现已由日产夏服二点五套提高到五套，有的且已达到六套。工人生产情绪高涨，正酝酿开展大规模竞赛运动。该厂自去年十二月中旬开始夏服生产以来，由于今年的夏服样式比较复杂难做，工人技术不熟练，达不到生产标准，因而工人工资收入减少，情绪一度低落。市总工会筹委会和市青委发现后，马上抓紧处理这一问题，设法帮助工人克服困难，有计划地培养典型班，以一厂二班作典型试验，吸取经验，以便推广全厂，提高生产标准。在试验班里，首先发动了劳动模范和党、团员带头组织技术研究组，利用休息时间，根据一般比较难做的地方和退回的活，研究改进办法，如怎样开领，怎样挖兜等，得出一致的意见后再推广到其他车工和副工。最初参加的车工和副工仅有二十九人，后来由于研究获得成绩，该班全体车工和副工都卷入技术研究的热潮里去了。这时各小组也结合本组的具体情况不但继续研究工作，并订出每天的生产计划，实行记功制，每天在墙上发表每组的产量和被退回（不合标准）的活。在竞赛的鼓舞下，每组工人都互相督促加紧生产，争取本组得到良好成绩。从十三日起，每人都订出了自己每天的生产计划，大多数都提前完成了。根据二班的经验，别的班也都自动组织起来纷纷挑战。现在该厂即将展开班与班间和厂与厂间的大规模生产竞赛，以保证夏服生产任务的胜利完成。
