Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: TASS Moscow, 4th: Grinining, in an article in Izvestia, commented on the disaster that the Marshall Plan brought to Denmark, stating: Denmark's foreign trade has changed under the pressure of the Marshall Plan. The proportion of the United States in the Danish import market increased from 11.15% before the war to 20.25% in 1947 and 1948. Previously, Denmark obtained a large amount of industrial raw materials and livestock feed from Eastern European countries, but now the quantity of imports has decreased. The change in foreign trade has first created a contradiction between Denmark's traditional export orientation limited to Europe and the import goods from the United States. American-made goods, as well as some British-made goods, flooded the Danish market, causing a reduction in Danish production and an increase in unemployment. According to official figures, there were 63,000 unemployed in Denmark at the end of November 1949, 12,000 more than a year ago. But in reality, the number of unemployed in Denmark is no less than 100,000, which is a very large number in a small country like Denmark. After the devaluation of the krone, consumer prices rose and taxes also increased, but wages did not increase, and the burden on the working people became increasingly heavy.

    Finally, the author pointed out that Denmark's participation in the aggressive North Atlantic Alliance to join the Marshall Plan has greatly increased its military budget. The Copenhagen ruling group allowed the United States to occupy Greenland, and also participated in the so-called "free trade" system, allowing American goods to be dumped without restriction. Denmark is increasingly losing its national independence and sovereignty, which has aroused the growing anger of the Danish people.

    丹麦的经济灾难
    失业者不下十万人  丹币贬值物价上涨
    【新华社北京十日电】塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：格林宁顷在消息报撰文评述马歇尔计划给丹麦带来的灾难称：丹麦的对外贸易已在马歇尔计划的压力下起了变化。美国在丹麦入口市场所占的比重，在一九四七和一九四八年已自战前的百分之十一点一五增至二十点二五。从前丹麦自东欧国家获得大量工业原料和牲畜饲料，现在入口的数量已经下降。对外贸易的变化首先造成丹麦出口一向限于欧洲内部的倾向与来自美国的入口货之间的矛盾。美国制造品以及一部分的英国制造品，充斥丹麦市场，使丹麦生产减少、失业增加。据官方数字，丹麦在一九四九年十一月底已有六万三千人失业，较一年前多一万二千人。但实际上丹麦失业的不下十万人，在丹麦这样一个小国，这是一个很大的数字。丹币贬值后，消费品价格上涨，税额也增加了，工资却没有提高，劳动人民负担日益沉重。
    最后作者指出，丹麦为参加马歇尔计划而卷入侵略性的北大西洋联盟，使军事预算大大增加。哥本哈根统治集团让美国占据了格林兰，又参加所谓“自由贸易”制度，允许美货无限制地倾销。丹麦已愈来愈丧失了国家的独立主权，这引起丹麦人民日益增长的愤怒。
