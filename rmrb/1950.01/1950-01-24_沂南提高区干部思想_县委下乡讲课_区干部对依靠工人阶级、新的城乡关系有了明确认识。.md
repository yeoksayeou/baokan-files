    Yinan Improves Cadre Thinking
    County Committee Sends Lectures to the Countryside
    District Cadres Gain Clear Understanding of Reliance on the Working Class and New Urban-Rural Relationships.
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Yinan County Committee in Shandong Province has adopted the method of sending lectures to the countryside for district cadres, in order to improve the political awareness of district cadres and strengthen their ability to study independently. The specific method is: when assigning tasks for a stage of work, the county committee does not rely on the district committees to transmit the information, emphasizing direct meetings between the county committee and general district cadres; in the assignment of tasks, the policies and the central documents for current study are explained. At the same time, the county committee, based on the study situation of the district cadres, sets off in separate groups, concentrating all cadres in two or three districts to give lectures. In the past six months, this method has been used to give six major lectures to district cadres, covering topics such as the reports and documents of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the issue of people's representative conferences at all levels, and the issue of internationalism.
    Since the establishment of the county committee's lecture system, the general district cadres have gained a preliminary understanding of the Party's various policies: (1) They have begun to clarify the concept of relying on Party branches and have given play to the role of Party branches as strongholds. In the countryside, the Party branch is the basic organization of the Party, and its leading role must be fully utilized. Therefore, in many villages, the Party branch has been at the core of promoting winter cultivation. (2) They have also gained a clearer understanding of the new urban-rural relationship. Liu Zhongpei said: "In the past, I only knew that cities could not survive without the raw materials and grain from the countryside, and I thought that farmers could live without cities as well, that the eight-year War of Resistance was won without cities. Now I know that without the working class, without industry, without new-style farm tools, agricultural production will not improve, living standards cannot be improved, and the country cannot become rich and strong." Most comrades have recognized that today's cities are different from the cities of the past. (3) In the past, many cadres believed that organizing mutual aid teams was to support the front lines and help the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers with production. Since the war had spread to the south and the corvée labor was lighter, they thought that mutual aid was no longer needed and became lax in leading the masses in production. After studying the reports and documents of the Second Plenary Session, cadres in various districts conducted self-criticisms. For example, Bai Buzhen and Qi Xinghua, cadres in Tieshan District, said: "Now I know that if we do not lead the masses to organize, we will be in danger of taking the capitalist road in the future." Li Yuhou of Changshan District said: "I have been working for so many years, and only now do I realize that developing production is the ultimate goal of the revolution." (4) The problem of individual futures was solved. In the past, a few cadres believed that the revolution had a future, but individuals had no future, so they often thought about demobilization. After studying, they overcame the idea of demobilization. For example, Wang Xiuzhen of Gegou District reflected and said: "I used to only think about demobilization, but now I understand that if I don't lead the masses in mutual aid production, I will take the capitalist road in the future, and the peasants will still be unable to avoid poverty and exploitation." In general, cadres have deeply recognized the importance of study from the past six months of lectures and study, and most cadres have made personal study plans for the future.

    沂南提高区干部思想
    县委下乡讲课
    区干部对依靠工人阶级、新的城乡关系有了明确认识。
    【本报讯】山东沂南县县委采取下乡给区干部上课的方法，以提高区干部的政治认识，并加强其自学能力。具体办法是：在布置一个阶段的工作时，不由分区委传达，强调县委和一般区干部直接见面；在布置任务中，讲明政策与当前学习的中心文件。同时，县委根据各区干部的学习情况，分头出发，以两三个区为单位，集中所有干部讲课。半年来用这种办法给区干部上了六次大课，所讲内容有二中全会报导文件，各界人民代表会议的问题，国际主义问题等。
    该县自建立县委讲课制度以后，一般区干部对党的各种政策，有了初步认识：（一）开始明确了依靠支部的观念，发挥了支部的堡垒作用。在农村，支部就是党的基础组织，必须充分发挥支部的领导作用。因此，好多村庄在冬耕中均以支部为核心，推动了工作。（二）对新的城乡关系也有了较明确的认识。刘中沛说：“过去我光知道城市离开农村的原料、粮食不能生存，认为农民不要城市也能活下去，八年抗战没有城市一样胜利了。现在才知道没有工人阶级，没有工业，没有新式农具，农业生产就不会提高，生活不能改善，国家不能富强。”一般同志都认识了现在的城市与过去的城市不同了。（三）过去不少干部认为组织变工组是为了支援前线，帮助烈属、军属生产，自战争打到南方以后，差务轻了，认为变工互助已不需要，对领导群众生产也松懈下来。自学了二中全会报导文件以后，各区干部作了思想检查，如铁山区干部柏步珍、齐兴华等说：“现在才知道，咱若不领导群众组织起来，将来会走上资本主义道路的危险。”长山区李余厚说：“我作了这些年工作，才知道发展生产是革命的最终目的。”（四）解决了个人前途的问题。过去少数干部认为革命有前途，个人无前途，因此常想复员。经过学习，克服了复员思想，如葛沟区王秀振反省说：“我过去光想复员，现在我明白了不领导群众互助生产，将来会走资本主义的道路，农民仍然免不了受贫困和剥削。一般干部从半年来的讲课学习中，深切认识了学习的重要，大部分干部，都订出了今后个人的学习计划。
