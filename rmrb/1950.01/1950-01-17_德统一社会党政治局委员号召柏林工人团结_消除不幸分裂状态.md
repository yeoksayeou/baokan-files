    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: TASS, Berlin, 12th:  SED Politburo Member Dahlem, speaking at a conference of activists of the SED Berlin organization here, said: "We firmly believe that, due to the new balance of power in the world and Europe, as long as the entire German working class unites and exerts its strength, it can thwart the military plans of American imperialism in West Germany." Dahlem continued: "The experience of the Chinese People's Revolution is of utmost importance to the German people.  Neither American tanks nor British warships can do anything about the Chinese revolution."

    Referring to the situation in West Berlin, Dahlem pointed out that by the end of 1949, West Berlin already had 280,000 fully unemployed people, 57,000 semi-unemployed people, and another 270,000 people living on pensions and 150,000 people living on social relief. The regulations for determining "impoverished circumstances" implemented in the autumn of 1949 deprived another 23,000 unemployed people of unemployment relief. There are currently 12,000 enterprises in West Berlin that cannot operate at full capacity. At the same time, capitalists are launching a full-scale offensive to cut wages. Dahlem declared: Therefore, the task of the SED Berlin organization is to unite West Berlin workers to fight for wages and jobs, and to fight for pensions and relief for the poor. In this regard, SED members must expand their activities and obtain genuine cooperation from the masses of German Social Democratic Party members and members of independent trade union opposition. He also pointed out: The policies implemented by the SED in East Berlin, in contrast to the policies implemented by the German Social Democratic Party in West Berlin, can give the working people of Berlin an opportunity to recognize which path is correct.

    Dahlem concluded: Establishing a unified working-class front for the entire city of Berlin can eliminate the unfortunate state of division and begin a decisive struggle to win the interests of the working people.

    德统一社会党政治局委员号召柏林工人团结
    消除不幸分裂状态
    【新华社北京十六日电】塔斯社柏林十二日讯：德国统一社会党政治局委员达赖姆，在此间举行的统一社会党柏林组织积极分子会议上演讲称：“我们深信，由于世界和欧洲新的力量对比，只要全德工人阶级团结一致，发挥力量，就能挫败美帝国主义在西德的军事计划。”达赖姆继称：中国人民革命的经验，对德国人民有至大的重要性。对于中国的革命，无论美国坦克或是英国军舰都毫无办法。
    论及西柏林的情势时，达赖姆指出，到一九四九年年底为止，西柏林已有全失业者二十八万人，半失业者五万七千人，还有二十七万靠养老金和十五万靠社会救济生活的人。一九四九年秋季实施的确定“贫苦情况”的条例，又使二万三千失业者失去了失业救济。西柏林现有一万二千家企业不能全周开工，同时，资本家正在全力发动攻势削减工资。达赖姆宣称：因此，德国统一社会党柏林党组织的任务，就是联合西柏林的职工争取工资和工作，为贫苦者争取养老金和救济。在这方面，统一社会党的党员必须扩大活动，取得德国社会民主党党员群众和独立的工会反对派的会员群众的真正合作。他又指出：德国统一社会党在东柏林所执行的政策，在和德国社会民主党在西柏林所执行的政策对比之下，可以使柏林的劳动人民有机会认清那一条路是正确的。
    达赖姆最后说：建立柏林全市统一的工人阶级阵线，可以消除不幸的分裂状态，并开始争取劳动人民利益的决定性斗争。
