Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 6th: The Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of the secretaries of the prefectural committees of Guanzhong from the 17th to the 23rd of last month to review the rural mass work in the new areas. Attending the meeting were the secretaries of the prefectural committees of Xianyang, Sanyuan, Weinan, Dali, Binxian, and Baoji, as well as some county-level leading cadres, and dozens of relevant party cadres from the Northwest Bureau and the Border Region Government. The meeting was personally presided over by Xi Zhongxun, secretary of the Northwest Bureau. According to the meeting's review, since the Guanzhong Prefectural Committee Secretaries Meeting in July, the rural mass work in various areas has made great achievements, mainly: the organized bandits have been eliminated, the grain requisition task has been completed, all-circles people's representative conferences and peasant representative conferences have been convened, the people have been led to rescue from rain disasters and replant winter wheat, the construction of rural people's political power has begun, and the struggle against local bullies has been initiated with emphasis, etc. However, many deviations, large and small, have also occurred in various areas, such as arbitrary arrests and beatings in some areas, unreasonably light or heavy burdens of public grain, arbitrary confiscation of property in individual places, and arbitrary confiscation of civilian firearms. Xi Zhongxun summarized the results of the meeting's research and made a conclusion. He pointed out that the current rural work in the new areas of Guanzhong should still focus on thoroughly suppressing bandits, combined with the struggle against local bullies with emphasis; promote various tasks around this center, deeply mobilize the masses, and actively prepare to guide the rural mass movement from the key points to a comprehensive development. In his summary, he also clearly stipulated the policies and strategies for leading the mass movement, emphasized the importance of holding good all-circles people's representative conferences and peasant representative conferences, and called on cadres at all levels to strengthen unity and strive to learn.

    西北局召开关中地委书记会议
    检讨新区农村群众工作
    习仲勋指出当前工作仍以深入剿匪为中心
    【新华社西安六日电】中共中央西北局召集关中各分区地委书记，于上月十七日至二十三日开会检讨新区农村群众工作。到会的有咸阳、三原、渭南、大荔、邠县、宝鸡六个分区的地委书记，及若干县级领导干部，西北局、边区政府各部门有关党员干部共数十人。会议由西北局书记习仲勋亲自主持。根据会议的检讨，自七月关中各分区地委书记会议后，各地农村群众工作已有很大成绩，主要的是：成股土匪已经肃清，完成了征粮任务，召开了各界人民代表会和农民代表会，领导人民抢救雨灾，抢种冬麦，开始建设乡村人民政权，开始有重点地发动了反恶霸斗争等等。但各地也发生不少或大或小的偏差，如有些地区随便捕人、打人，公粮负担畸轻畸重，个别地方乱没收财产，乱收缴民间枪支等。习仲勋综合会议研究结果，作出了总结。他指出，当前关中新区农村工作，仍以深入剿匪为中心，结合有重点的反恶霸斗争；围绕此项中心推动各种工作，深入发动群众，积极准备将农村群众运动，由重点引向全面开展。他在总结中并明确规定了领导群众运动的政策和策略，强调开好各界人民代表会议及农民代表会议，号召各级干部加强团结，努力学习。
