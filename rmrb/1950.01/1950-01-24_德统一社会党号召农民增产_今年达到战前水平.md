Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 21st (via TASS): The newspaper *Neues Deutschland* published an appeal from the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) to all farmers of the German Democratic Republic, calling on them to increase production and strive to bring the agricultural harvest in 1950 up to pre-war levels.

The appeal first outlines the achievements of the Republic's agriculture and the results of consolidating land reform. It then reports that, as of December 1949, loans provided to farmers for building houses alone amounted to 615 million marks, with a total of 54,496 houses built. Together with farm buildings, a total of 150,262 structures were built. In 1949, a state subsidy of 100 million marks was also allocated for the construction and expansion of machine rental stations. At the same time, extensive measures were taken to develop and promote animal husbandry.

The appeal then details the specific measures that the Politburo of the SED has resolved to recommend to the government of the German Democratic Republic for the benefit of working farmers. It specifically calls for attention to be paid to improving machine rental stations, strengthening the technical foundations of each station, improving the supply of livestock feed and fertilizer seeds, improving the system for the delivery of agricultural products, improving the method of payment for these agricultural products, and other measures to strengthen the Republic's agriculture.
