    U.S. State Department's Aggression Policy Architect
    Jessup Comes to the Far East to Plot Aggressive Conspiracy to Independently Conclude a Peace Treaty with Japan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th] Jessup, the Ambassador-at-Large sent by the United States to the Far East for "inspection" and the architect of the State Department's Far East aggression policy, arrived in Taipei on the 15th, the nest of the Kuomintang remnant bandits, after completing his tour of Seoul and Okinawa from the 11th to the 14th.

    The purpose of Jessup's trip to the Far East is to examine the overall situation in the Far East and preside over the "U.S. Far East Diplomatic Personnel Conference" to be held in Bangkok on February 13 in order to revise the overall aggressive plan for the Far East. Jessup stayed in Japan for quite some time this time. From the 5th to the 10th, he held several secret talks with MacArthur in Japan. According to a United Press report on the 8th, one of the main issues discussed was the "separate peace treaty that does not include the Soviet Union" and "the U.S. demand to establish military bases in Japan" and "the conclusion of a U.S.-Japan alliance" after the conclusion of such a treaty. This activity of the American reactionaries is in line with the plan formulated at the meeting of the U.S. and British foreign ministers in Washington last September. According to this plan, the U.S. and British groups decided to convene a meeting of the countries of the Far Eastern Commission as soon as possible to formulate a peace treaty with Japan, and opposed the procedure of preparing the peace treaty with Japan by the four foreign ministers, and opposed the principle of unanimity of the great powers, so that the opinions of the U.S. and British groups, especially the U.S. reactionary plan for Japan, could be smoothly passed in the eleven-nation meeting of the Far Eastern Commission, where they controlled the majority.

    The Yoshida traitorous government of Japan expressed its heartfelt support for the U.S. plan to enslave Japan under the guise of a "peace treaty" and turn Japan into the main base for U.S. aggression in the Far East. According to United Press, citing people close to the Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshida told Jessup during a meeting on the 10th: "If Japan is not to be conquered by the communists, then Japan must have the guarantee of U.S. military protection after the occupation ends." Yoshida also told Jessup of the Japanese government's desire to conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible, regardless of whether the Soviet Union and China participate or not.

    耶塞普来远东策划侵略密谋单独缔结对日和约
    【新华社北京十七日电】美国派至远东“视察”的无任所大使、国务院远东侵略政策的制订者耶塞普，于十一日至十四日完成在汉城、冲绳岛的巡视后，已于十五日飞抵国民党残匪的巢穴——台北。
    耶塞普此次远东之行的目的，在于考察整个远东情势，并主持二月十三日在曼谷举行的“美国远东外交人员会议”，以便重订远东的全盘侵略计划。耶塞普此次在日本勾留颇久。在五日至十日期间，他曾在日本与麦克阿瑟举行了多次密谈。密谈的主要问题之一，据合众社八日电透露，是关于“不要苏联参加的单独和约问题”，以及关于这种和约缔结后“美国要求在日本建立军事基地”及“缔结美日同盟”的问题。美国反动派的这种活动，是和去年九月美英外长在华盛顿会谈中所拟定的计划相符合。按照这一计划，美英集团决定尽早召开远东委员会各国会议，制定对日和约，并反对由四外长准备对日和约的程序，反对大国一致的原则，以便使美英集团的意见，特别是美国对日本的反动计划，能在它们控制多数的远东委员会十一国会议中，顺利通过。
    日本的吉田卖国政府，对于美国在《和约》外衣下奴役日本和变日本为美国在远东侵略的主要基地的计划，表示衷心的支持。据合众社引接近日本首相的人士称，吉田十日在与耶塞普会谈时曾告耶氏称：“如果要日本不为共产党所征服，则日本在占领结束后，必须有美国军事保护的保证。”吉田并将日本政府希望早日缔结和约，不管苏联与中国参加与否的愿望，告诉了耶塞普。
