    Land Reform in the Suburbs of Beijing
    More Than Six Hundred Advanced Farmers Join the Chinese Communist Party
    [Beijing News] Farmers in the suburbs of the capital have raised their awareness during the land reform and are actively requesting to join the Chinese Communist Party. In the first batch of eighty-four land reform villages, seventy-six Chinese Communist Party branches have been established, and six hundred and sixty-eight people have joined the Communist Party. The work of building the Party during the land reform was carried out in an open manner. First, in conjunction with each movement, the Party program and constitution were widely publicized. Party member candidates were discovered from among the activists in the land reform movement, especially the poor and hired peasant activists. After self-declaration and public discussion, approval by the branch, and approval by the district committee, they were admitted into the Party. Through land reform and Party education, the consciousness of farmers requesting to join the Party has greatly improved. Qu Dafu, a farmer from Komuzifang, said: If it weren't for the Communist Party, my family would have starved to death. The Communist Party came to save me. In the past, the grain harvested after a year of labor was quite a bit, but after paying rent and debts, it was all gone. I know that the Communist Party is saving the poor, and I am determined to join the Party. When new Party members in Nanzhuangzi paid their membership dues, some paid two thousand yuan. When they were told not to pay so much, they said: I have a lot of money and I am willing to pay more. Now that I have land to cultivate and have been politically liberated, I am willing to pay more membership dues from the bottom of my heart. In the villages where branches have been established, the masses feel that they have an organization and that there is a guarantee in their work. Their enthusiasm is even higher, their work is more active, and their unity is also very good. Therefore, the masses can very carefully help the Party to examine those who request to join the Party, fearing that bad people will mix into the Party. They said: The Communist Party serves the people and leads us to seek happiness. We follow the Communist Party and must never let a bad person join. For example, when Li Yongping from Liulangzhuang requested to join the Party, the masses said: The two brothers earned tens of thousands of catties of corn, but they took it to eat and gamble. We can't let him join.

    京郊土地改革中
    先进农民六百余参加中国共产党
    【北京讯】首都郊区农民在土地改革中觉悟提高，积极要求加入中国共产党。在第一批八十四个土地改革村中，已建立了七十六个中国共产党支部，有六百六十八人参加了共产党。土地改革中的建党工作是采取公开方式进行的，首先是结合着每一个运动，普遍的宣传党纲党章，从土地改革运动中的积极分子里，特别是贫雇农积极分子里，发现党员对象，经过自报公议，支部通过，区委批准，才吸收入党。经过土地改革与党的教育，要求加入党的农民觉悟有很大提高，驹子房农民屈大甫说：要不是共产党，我一家人都要饿死了，共产党来救了我，往年劳动一年打下的粮食倒不少，交了租、还了债就光了。我知道共产党是救穷人的，我要坚决入党。南庄子新党员交党费有人交二千元，不叫他交那样多时，他说：我钱多了愿多交就多交，现在有了地种，政治上翻了身，多交党费，我心中情愿。在建立起支部的村庄，群众觉得有了组织，工作上有了保障，情绪更为高涨，工作积极，团结也很好，因此群众都能很认真的帮助党来审查要求入党的人，恐怕坏人混到党内来。他们说：共产党是为人民服务的，领导咱们求幸福，咱们跟着共产党走，绝不能让一个坏人参加。如六郎庄李永平要求入党，群众说：他们哥俩挣了上万斤的玉米，却拿去吃了嫖了，不能叫他参加。
