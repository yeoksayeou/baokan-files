    The behavior of the Thai rulers—the Luang Phibunsongkhram fascist clique—in brutally persecuting Chinese residents has a long history. During its rule before the war, under the wing of Japanese imperialism, the Luang Phibunsongkhram clique actively advocated so-called "Greater Thai Nationalism," imitating Hitler's anti-Jewish tactics, claiming that overseas Chinese were the "Jews of the East," and exhausting all means of harming them. Luang Phibunsongkhram's incitement of anti-Chinese sentiment and hatred towards overseas Chinese at that time was an attempt to divert the Thai people's opposition to his fascist rule. After the war, this war criminal Luang Phibunsongkhram, who had fought alongside Japanese imperialism against the Allied forces, was once imprisoned, but was soon released under the protection of British and American imperialism. In the winter of 1947, he launched the "November 8th" coup and regained political power in Thailand. In April 1948, Luang Phibunsongkhram openly took power, serving as Prime Minister, and with the connivance of British and American imperialism, re-implemented anti-Chinese policies.
    The Luang Phibunsongkhram clique first deprived overseas Chinese of their freedom of cultural education. Between 1946 and 1947, there were more than 1,000 overseas Chinese primary and secondary schools in Thailand. After Luang Phibunsongkhram returned to power, he continuously and massively shut down progressive overseas Chinese schools and arrested teachers and staff. As a result of the destruction of over a thousand schools, only a few hundred remain now. According to the regulations of the Thai Ministry of Education: Chinese schools can only teach Chinese for one and a half to two hours per day, and the rest of the time must be taught in Thai; each school must have a Thai principal, and courses such as history, geography, arithmetic, singing, and physical education cannot be taught by Chinese teachers. Chinese teachers must be approved by the Ministry of Education and pass the Thai language teacher qualification examination before they can teach. There are currently 3,000 unemployed Chinese teachers in Thailand and 200,000 Chinese children out of school.
    Overseas Chinese newspapers have also suffered the same destruction. In the spring of last year, the Thai authorities searched the Quanmin Bao twice without cause, arresting four employees; they implemented censorship on the Zhenhua Bao, Quanmin Bao, and Minzhu Xinwen, and forced the Zhenhua Bao to cease publication.
    Closing down overseas Chinese schools, causing 200,000 children to be out of school; destroying overseas Chinese industry and commerce, making it impossible for hundreds of thousands of compatriots to live.
    The Luang Phibunsongkhram government formulated a series of "occupational reservation regulations" to destroy overseas Chinese businesses. In August 1948, Luang Phibunsongkhram ordered the prohibition of foreigners from operating eleven types of factories, including winemaking, sugar making, tofu, rice noodles, matches, leather making, silk making, glass, and glue boiling, of which 90 percent were operated by overseas Chinese. In February of last year, it was announced that ten occupations such as hairdressing, making Buddha statues, and rickshaws were not allowed for overseas Chinese, directly or indirectly affecting 100,000 compatriots. In May, eight more types of businesses, including rubber and soda, were added to the list of prohibitions for overseas Chinese, and at the same time, an order was issued to factories in eight areas of Bangkok to move out of the city within a certain period. Vegetable gardens, fish ponds, chicken farms, and pig farms operated by overseas Chinese in the suburbs were also ordered by the Thai authorities to be relocated or demolished, making it impossible for hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese to live.
    The Luang Phibunsongkhram fascist clique's persecution of the basic personal freedom of overseas Chinese has intensified. According to the "Regulations for Expelling Overseas Chinese," the Thai authorities can at any time use "suspicious behavior" and "no necessary residence" as excuses to unreasonably arrest or forcibly deport overseas Chinese.
    At the same time, Thai police spies can break into the residences and shops of overseas Chinese at any time, threaten them with "dangerous elements" and "left-leaning," conduct searches and extort money, and arbitrarily arrest overseas Chinese. On June 15, 1948, with the assistance of Kuomintang secret service agencies, the Thai authorities arrested 341 overseas Chinese at one time, including the principal of Nanyang Middle School and 23 teachers, and 18 overseas Chinese democrats. Since June of last year, the Thai police have used "investigating household registration" as a pretext to monitor the actions of overseas Chinese and established concentration villages specifically for detaining overseas Chinese. Many innocent overseas Chinese are still detained in Bangkok's large prisons, suffering inhumane treatment such as darkroom torture, beatings, and even assassinations.

### 泰国銮披汶政府的排华暴行

    泰国銮披汶政府的排华暴行
    泰国统治者——銮披汶法西斯集团野蛮迫害中国侨民的行为，是有长期历史的。銮披汶集团在战前执政期间，在日本帝国主义的卵翼下，曾积极倡导所谓“大泰族主义”，效法希特勒的排犹故技，扬言华侨为“东方犹太人”，极尽其残害之能事。銮披汶当时所以煽动排华与仇视华侨，是企图借此来转移泰国人民对其法西斯统治的反对。战后，这个曾与日本帝国主义对同盟国共同作战的战犯銮披汶，虽然一度入狱，但不久即在美英帝国主义的庇护下出狱，并于一九四七年冬发动“一一·八”政变，重行夺取了泰国政权。一九四八年四月，銮披汶公开出掌政权，自任国务院总理，在美英帝国主义的纵容下，重新实施排华政策。
    銮披汶集团首先剥夺华侨的文化教育自由。一九四六年至一九四七年间，泰国共有华侨中小学校一千多所。銮披汶重行登台以后，便不断地大批查封进步的华侨学校，逮捕侨校的教职员。千余所学校被摧残的结果，现在只剩下了数百所。根据泰国教育部的规定：华侨学校每天只能教一小时半至两小时的中文，其他时间必须以泰文教授；各校必须设泰国人校长一人，史地、算术、唱歌、体育等课程都不得由华侨教师任教。华侨教师必须经教育部核准，并参加泰文师资考试及格后始能任教。泰国现有三千华侨教师失业，二十万华侨儿童失学。
    华侨报纸也受到同样的摧残。去年春季，泰国当局曾无故搜查全民报两次，捕去职员四人；对真话报、全民报和民主新闻，实行新闻检查，并迫使真话报停刊。
    查封华侨学校，致二十万儿童失学；摧残华侨工商业，使数十万侨胞无法生活。
    銮披汶政府制订了一系列的“职业保留条例”，摧残华侨经营的工商业。一九四八年八月，銮披汶下令禁止外侨经营制酒、制糖、豆腐、米粉、火柴、制皮、制丝、玻璃及熬胶等十一种工厂，而上述工业的百分之九十是由华侨经营的。去年二月，又宣布理发、制造佛像、三轮车等十种职业，不许华侨经营，直接或间接受影响的侨胞达十万人。五月，更增加树胶、汽水等八种买卖不准华侨经营，同时下令曼谷八种厂坊，限期迁出市区。华侨在市郊经营的菜园、鱼池、养鸡场、养猪场等，亦被泰国当局下令迁移或拆毁，数十万华侨因而无法生活。
    銮披汶法西斯集团对于华侨基本人身自由的迫害，愈演愈烈。根据“驱逐华侨出境条例”，泰国当局随时可以“形迹可疑”、“非必须要居留”为借口，无理拘捕或强迫华侨离境。
    同时，泰国的警察暗探，可以随时闯入华侨的住宅和商店，以“危险分子”、“左倾”等相威胁，进行搜查和勒索，任意逮捕华侨。一九四八年六月十五日，泰国当局在国民党特务机关的协助下，曾一次逮捕了三百四十一名华侨，其中包括南洋中学校长及二十三名教员，和华侨民主人士十八名。自去年六月起，泰国警察更以“调查户口登记”为名，监视华侨行动，并设立集中村，专门拘禁华侨，曼谷的大监狱中，现在仍然拘押着许多无辜华侨，遭受着暗室折磨，毒打，甚至暗杀等惨无人道的待遇。
