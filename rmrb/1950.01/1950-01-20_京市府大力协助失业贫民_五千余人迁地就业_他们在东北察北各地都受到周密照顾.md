    The Beijing Municipal Government is vigorously assisting unemployed and impoverished people.
    More than 5,000 people resettled for employment.
    They received thorough care in Northeast China and Chahar.
    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Municipal People's Government, in implementing the decision made last August to resettle the unemployed, has enabled 5,819 people to obtain employment and embark on productive or working positions. Among them, 329 intellectuals were introduced to Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces to serve as primary school teachers, and five went to Inner Mongolia as middle school teachers. 864 were introduced to work in coal mines in Northeast China; 155 went to Inner Mongolia to participate in logging; and another 1,168 moved to Chahar and Suiyuan to settle down and cultivate land. In addition, those who had fled to Beijing from areas such as North China, Northeast China, Central China, and South China and had no special skills have been mobilized to return to their hometowns for production. The People's Government has spent a total of more than 100,000 jin of millet equivalent in helping the above-mentioned personnel to find employment, of which food expenses and travel expenses totaled more than 94,000 jin of millet, and shoe expenses, training and education expenses, and other miscellaneous expenses totaled more than 6,000 jin. At the beginning of the work, some people were reluctant to leave Beijing. After persuasion, education, and care in life, their emotions have changed. In Chahar, the local People's Government has taken good care of them. They have been allocated land and houses, and have been lent a year's worth of rations. Those who went to work in coal mines in Northeast China were mostly rickshaw pullers and unemployed workers during the Kuomintang rule. They also had ideological concerns at first and were unwilling to work as miners. Coupled with the bad influence of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang's capture of miners, they also harbored suspicion towards the People's Government. After the People's Government personnel patiently persuaded them and lent them settlement expenses to solve the livelihood problems of their families, they were very touched and realized that the People's Government had sincerity and goodwill, and then they went there happily. Zhao Chang, a worker from the Fifth District of Beijing who moved to Northeast China, said in a letter: "The equipment and treatment of the Fushun Coal Mine, and the enthusiasm of the old workers towards the new workers, are really admirable." He also said that the houses there have heating. The mine has complete equipment and is fully mechanized in production, with absolutely no danger. There are clubs, bathhouses, canteens, dormitories, employee cooperatives...etc. Worker Wang Heng from the First District wrote in a letter: "The Communist Party never deceives people. What is said is done." The Municipal Government plans to further strengthen contact with various provinces and regions in the future so that those who relocate for employment in the future can obtain greater convenience.

    京市府大力协助失业贫民
    五千余人迁地就业
    他们在东北察北各地都受到周密照顾
    【本报讯】北京市人民政府执行去年八月安置失业的决议，已使五千八百十九人获得职业，走上生产或工作岗位。其中有三百二十九名知识分子被介绍到河北、察哈尔、绥远等省充任小学教师，五名到内蒙任中学教师；介绍去东北煤矿作工的八百六十四名；去内蒙参加伐木的一百五十五人；另一千一百六十八名移往察北、绥北安家开垦。此外，原华北、东北、华中、华南等地区流亡来京而无特长者，经过动员已还乡生产。人民政府在帮助上述人员就业中，共支出了折合小米十万余斤的款项，其中饭费、路费两项共合小米九万四千余斤，鞋费、训练教育费及其他杂费共六千余斤。在工作开始时，有些人曾留恋北京生活，经过说服教育与生活上的照顾，情绪都已转变。在察北方面，当地人民政府对他们照顾颇周到，他们已分到土地和房屋，并借到一年的口粮。去东北煤矿工作的以三轮车夫和国民党统治时期的失业工人为最多。他们最初也有思想顾虑，不愿做矿工，再加上日寇和国民党抓矿工的不良影响，因此曾对人民政府也抱怀疑态度。经人民政府人员耐心说服，并借给安家费用，解决了家属生活问题后，他们非常感动，认识到人民政府具有真诚和善意，始欣然前往。移往东北的京市五区工友赵昌在来信中说：抚顺煤矿的设备及待遇，老工友对新工友的热诚，实在令人钦佩。并说那里房子有暖气。矿内设备完善，完全是机械化生产，绝无危险。矿中有俱乐部、澡堂、食堂、宿舍、职工合作社……等等。一区工人王恒来信说：“共产党绝不骗人，说到那里做到那里。”市府计划今后更加强对各省、各地的联系，以便使今后迁地就业人员得到更大的方便条件。
