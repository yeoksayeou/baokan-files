    Southern Anhui Establishes Tunxi Tea Branch Company
    [Southern Anhui News] The Southern Anhui People's Administrative Office convened a regional tea conference earlier this month to determine the region's tea business plan and production policy for the coming year, and to establish a state-owned Tunxi Tea Branch Company. After hearing the transmission of the spirit of the National Tea Conference, the meeting divided into groups for in-depth discussions. Finally, in accordance with the resolutions of the National Conference, the Tunxi Tea Branch Company was established to uniformly control the purchase, manufacture, transportation, sales, research and improvement of "Qihong Tunlv" teas. Manufacturing plants and purchasing stations, both mechanized and manual, will be set up in various tea-producing areas. The meeting determined that the region's output for the coming year will be approximately 136,000 dan, requiring a doubling of production compared to this year. To achieve this goal, it was decided to implement tea loans and guarantee tea prices, and to plan for all tea production to be mechanized within one or two years in order to improve quality, reduce costs, quickly restore the quality and international market reputation of tea, and use tea exports to exchange for materials necessary for our country's construction.
