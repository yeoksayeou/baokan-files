    Tianjin Railway Bureau's Year-End Material Inventory
    Clears Out Forty Billion Worth of Waste Materials

    [Our Newspaper] The Tianjin Railway Bureau conducted a major material inspection at the end of last year, discovering over 3,900 tons of waste steel and other materials stored in various material warehouses, including damaged vehicles and incomplete machinery. This waste material is worth approximately forty billion (waste materials stored in factories and sections are not included). Much of it is actually usable, but it has been frozen in storage in the past (some material warehouses have utilized some of it). The Fengtai Material Factory inspected waste oil that had been stored for four or five years and found a total of 913 usable barrels of various types of oil, weighing approximately 180 tons. At market prices, this is worth over 300 million. The clearing out of these useful resources has added a large amount of wealth to the nation.

    天津铁路局年底清查材料
    清出废料值四十亿
    【本报讯】天津铁路局在去年年底进行了一次材料大检查，发现各材料库中存有废钢铁等三千九百余吨，包括破车及不完全的机器。此项废料约值四十余亿（厂段所存废料尚不在内）。其中还有许多是可以使用的，但过去均被冻结起来了（有的材料库曾利用过）。丰台材料厂，从存放四、五年的废油中，检验出能用的各种油共九一三桶，约重一百八十余吨。按市价约值三亿多元。这些有用的资财被清理出来，增加了国家一笔很大财富。
