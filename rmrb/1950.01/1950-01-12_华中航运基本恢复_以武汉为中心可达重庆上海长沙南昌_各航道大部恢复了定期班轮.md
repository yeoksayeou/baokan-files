    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, January 11th: The shipping industry in Central China, with Wuhan as its center, has basically been restored. Now, the Yangtze River provides access westward to Chongqing and eastward to Shanghai. The Han River reaches Xiangfan, the Xiang River reaches Changsha, and the Gan River reaches Nanchang. Other rivers such as the Zi River and Li River have also long since resumed navigation. Most waterways have resumed regular passenger and cargo liners. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently nearly four hundred public and private passenger and cargo ships, with a total tonnage of approximately 90,000 tons, equivalent to 53% of the total tonnage in this region before the War of Resistance Against Japan. There are 10,188 sailboats, with an estimated total tonnage of around 220,000 tons. From June to the end of last year alone, the number of passengers entering and leaving Wuhan reached over 381,000, and the volume of goods exceeded 98 million tons. Other military transportation is not included in these figures. At the beginning of the takeover of Wuhan, due to the imperfect organization of maritime administration, ship inspections and seafarer education were poorly conducted. In addition, most of the navigation marks along the river had been destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops, resulting in several collisions and groundings in a period of more than four months. To this end, the People's Government issued a decision on guaranteeing navigation safety on November 20th of last year, instructing maritime administrative organs to strictly inspect ships, examine crew members and pilots, and quickly restore navigation marks. Now, the work of river channel construction has been greatly strengthened. The review and registration of pilots, the examination of ship drivers and engineers, and the registration and review of ships in the Central China Yangtze River area have been carried out successively and are underway. The Maritime Affairs Bureau has also hired personnel with specialized knowledge of maritime administration and navigation experience from the Navigation Advancement Association and the Shipping Industry Association to establish the Central China Maritime Administration Guidance Committee and the Committee for Handling Maritime Disputes in order to solve various problems in shipping.

    华中航运基本恢复
    以武汉为中心可达重庆上海长沙南昌
    各航道大部恢复了定期班轮
    【新华社汉口十一日电】以武汉为中心的华中航运事业基本上已告恢复。现由长江西通重庆、东达上海，由汉水可至襄樊，由湘江可至长沙，由赣江可至南昌，其他资江、澧江等亦早已恢复通航。各航道已大部恢复了定期班轮。据不完全统计，现有公私客货轮船近四百艘，总吨位约九万吨，相当于抗战前本地区总吨位的百分之五十三。帆船有一万零一百八十八只，估计总吨位在二十二万吨左右。自去年六月至年底，仅进出武汉一地的旅客即达三十八万一千余人，货物九千八百余万吨。其他军运尚未计算在内。武汉接管之初，由于航政组织不健全，对船舶审查、海员教育等进行较差，加以沿江航行标志多数已被国民党匪军破坏，以致四个余月中，曾连续发生碰撞、搁浅等事件数次。为此，人民政府曾于去年十一月二十日发布保证航行安全的决定，责成航政机关严格检验船舶、审查船员和引水人员，并迅速恢复航行标志。现在江道建设工作已大为加强，已先后进行了并正在进行引水人员的审查登记、轮船驾驶、司机人员的考试，和华中长江区船舶的登记审查。航政局又聘请航业协进会、轮船业公会各有关部门具有航政专门知识和有航行经验人员，成立了华中航政指导委员会和处理海事纠纷的委员会，以解决航运中的各项问题。
