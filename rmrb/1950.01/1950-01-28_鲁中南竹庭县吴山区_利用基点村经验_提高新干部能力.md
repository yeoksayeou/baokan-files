    Central and Southern Shandong, Zhuting County, Wushan District
    Utilizing Base Village Experience
    to Improve the Abilities of New Cadres
    [Our Newspaper News] News from Central and Southern Shandong: Wushan District, Zhuting County, Central and Southern Shandong Administrative Region, has adopted various methods to improve the working abilities of new cadres from peasant backgrounds, thus promoting the work. Of the district's forty-six cadres, eighty percent are semi-literate or illiterate, and most have only recently left production, lacking work experience. In order to improve their working abilities, district-level leaders, in addition to regular classes and leading policy and theoretical study, have adopted the following methods in practical work:
    (1) In each movement, cadres are organized in a timely manner to study the work experience of base villages. For example, during the winter election of labor models last year, cadres generally lacked experience in leading the masses to conduct elections. In Niujiazhuang, without sufficient deliberation, the masses were simply asked to elect by shouting slogans and raising hands, which had a negative impact. In response to this situation, district leaders convened a meeting of all cadres, introducing the methods and experience of base villages in electing labor models using the mass line, and summarizing it theoretically. They then organized cadres to hold discussions, linking it to their own working methods, thereby improving the cadres' understanding and working abilities, and correcting the deviations in the work of various villages. In addition, whenever a new task is received, the district, in addition to making general arrangements for all cadres, also absorbs some cadres who are slower to grasp new issues to participate in base village work. After the base village work has gained initial experience, they are used to educate them with examples, teach them some specific methods, help them formulate short-term plans, and then assign them to work. For example, when starting to mobilize the masses to select seeds, some cadres worried and said, "We don't know how to select." However, after participating in a period of base village work, some cadres said, "Now I have the ability to work in any village."
    (2) Discover problems from work reports and organize cadres to study in a timely manner. For example, when female cadre Chen Xuefeng worked in Dazhuzhou Village last summer, she took two women to weed in the fields, promoting the participation of all the village women in labor. Cadre Wang Daoyi personally helped the masses to cultivate cotton in Dongshigou, and used examples to promote all the villagers. The district immediately organized all cadres to hold discussions and study the good style and methods of these comrades, encouraging everyone to consciously examine their shortcomings and improve their work.
    (3) For cadres who have recently left production and have weak abilities, assign more simple tasks and help them study how to do it and make plans. After many exercises, the working ability of these cadres has gradually improved. For responsible cadres in departments with stronger abilities, focus on cultivating their ability to work independently. Each time a new task is assigned, only principle opinions are put forward, and they make detailed plans themselves, which are executed after being reviewed and revised by leading cadres. Therefore, the responsible cadres of various business departments in the district have now overcome their dependence on thinking, implemented a work diary system, and strived to practice summarizing work.

    鲁中南竹庭县吴山区
    利用基点村经验
    提高新干部能力
    【本报讯】鲁中南消息：鲁中南行政区竹庭县吴山区，采用各种方法提高农民出身的新干部的工作能力，推进了工作。该区共四十六名干部，百分之八十是粗识文字的和文盲，而且大部分脱离生产不久，工作经验缺乏。区级领导上为提高他们的工作能力，除平时上课、领导进行政策和理论学习以外，在实际工作中采取了以下几个方法：
    （一）每一运动中，及时组织干部研究基点村工作经验。如去年冬季选举劳动模范时，一般干部都缺乏领导群众进行选举的经验，如牛家庄未酝酿成熟，就叫群众用喊口号、举手的简单方式选举了出来，影响不好。根据这一情况，区领导上便召开全体干部会议，介绍了基点村运用群众路线选举劳动模范的方法和经验，并提高到理论上加以总结，再组织干部座谈，联系自己的工作方法加以讨论，这样提高了干部的认识和工作能力，纠正了各村工作的偏向。另外，每逢接受一个新的任务时，区里除向全体干部作一般布置外，并吸收部分接受新问题较慢的干部参加基点村工作，待基点村工作取得初步经验之后，即运用实例教育他们，教给他们一些具体方法，帮助订出短期计划，再分配下去工作。如开始发动群众选种时，一部分干部发愁，说“不会选”，但经参加了一段基点村工作后，有的干部说：“这会我不管上那庄工作，都有本事了。”
    （二）从工作汇报中发现问题，及时组织干部学习。如妇女干部陈学凤去年夏季在大珠州村工作时，带着两个妇女下地锄草，推动了全村妇女参加劳动。干部王道义在东石沟亲自帮助群众修棉，并运用实例推动了全村群众。区里即连续组织全体干部座谈研究这些同志的好作风和好方法，启发大家自觉地检讨缺点，改进工作。
    （三）对新近脱离生产而能力弱的干部，多分配较单纯的任务，并帮助他们研究怎样作法，作计划等。经过多次锻炼，这些干部工作能力逐渐提高了。对待能力较强的部门负责干部，则着重培养其独立工作能力，每次布置新的任务，只提出原则性的意见，由他自己作出详细计划，经领导干部审查修改后执行。因此，现在全区各业务部门的负责干部，已经克服了依赖思想，都实行工作日记制度，并努力练习总结工作。
