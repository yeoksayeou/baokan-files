Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 25th: To strengthen disaster relief through production in the entire province, the Hubei Provincial People's Government convened a provincial production and disaster relief meeting on the 10th. In addition to establishing the Hubei Provincial Production and Disaster Relief Committee and electing Provincial Chairman Li Xiannian as the director, the meeting determined that the general principle for the current production and disaster relief work in the province should be primarily based on vigorously mobilizing the masses to carry out self-salvation through production, supplemented by government assistance. In implementing the above principles, all localities should widely organize the masses to carry out reclamation, firewood gathering, charcoal burning, medicinal herb digging, fishing, and other sideline production, help disaster-stricken people and poor peasants solve the difficulties of production funds, and mobilize the masses to carry out mutual assistance and free lending. On the government side, the following specific measures should be implemented: 1. Use the total of 40 million jin of grain allocated by the Central People's Government and the Provincial Government to repair dikes, close breaches, and repair sluice gates in flood-stricken areas through the method of work relief. 2. Provide low-interest grain loans of 20 million jin in disaster areas to help disaster-stricken people carry out spring agriculture and sideline production. 3. Extract 20% from local grain reserves, approximately 20 to 30 million jin of grain, and invest it in agricultural production to build ponds and weirs. 4. From January to June, local troops throughout the province will save one tael of rice per person per day, and local cadres and miscellaneous staff will save two taels of rice per person per day, totaling approximately 2 million jin of grain, for disaster relief. 5. Issue water conservancy grain loans of 7.5 million to 10 million jin, specifically for assisting farmers in restoring and building water conservancy projects. 6. Loan 3 million jin of cotton seeds to promote improved varieties and expand cotton planting areas. 7. Before March, transport approximately 200 million jin of public grain, with transportation costs of approximately 20 to 30 million jin of grain, and organize disaster-stricken people and the poor to participate in transportation as a form of work relief. 8. Banks should vigorously promote value-guaranteed savings and focus on supporting mass credit cooperatives to absorb social idle funds into production. Regarding the solution of the supply and marketing of agricultural and sideline products, the Hubei Provincial People's Government decided to purchase tung oil, medicinal materials, fungus, and other mountain products in mountainous areas with 50 million jin of grain, and to purchase 1 to 2 million bolts of native cloth in a planned way in disaster areas that produce cloth, transport them to Gansu, Shaanxi, Guizhou, and other places, and help fishermen in the lake area organize fish markets or cooperatives to promote fish production. In addition, the Provincial Taxation Bureau has formulated tax reduction measures for local products to develop and promote local products, and has submitted them to the Central Plains Provisional People's Government and the Central People's Government for approval and implementation. The meeting finally pointed out that in order to achieve the above-mentioned production and disaster relief guidelines, as long as all localities can quickly correct the apathetic thoughts of some cadres who are indifferent to the serious disaster situation and the pessimistic and disappointed emotions of some disaster victims, as long as all localities take appropriate measures to adjust grain, mobilize disaster victims to save food and vigorously organize disaster victims to carry out production, they will surely be able to overcome the severe famine.

    鄂全省加强生产救灾
    政府拨粮四千万斤以工代赈
    贷放棉种粮食扶助灾民生产
    【新华社汉口二十五日电】湖北省人民政府为加强全省生产救灾工作，特于十日召开全省生产救灾会议。会上除成立湖北省生产救灾委员会、选举省主席李先念为主任委员外，并确定目前全省生产救灾的总方针为以大力发动群众进行生产自救为主、政府扶助为辅。在贯彻上述方针中各地应广泛组织群众进行开荒、打柴、烧炭、挖药材、打鱼及其他副业生产，帮助灾民及贫苦农民解决生产资金困难，发动群众进行互助互济，自由借贷；在政府方面，应实行如下具体措施：一、以中央人民政府已拨发的和省府拨发的共四千万斤粮食，用以工代赈的方法，在水灾区修堤、堵口、修闸。二、在灾区进行低利贷粮二千万斤，扶助灾民进行春季农业和副业生产。三、从地方粮中提出百分之二十，约二千万斤到三千万斤粮食，投入农业生产，兴修塘堰。四、从一月至六月，全省地方部队每人每天节约一两米，地方干部和杂勤人员每人每天节约二两米，共约二百万斤粮食，作为救灾之用。五、发放水利贷粮七百五十万至一千万斤，专用于扶助农民恢复和建设水利。六、贷棉种三百万斤，推广优良品种，扩大种棉面积。七、在三月份以前，调运公粮约二亿斤，运费约二千万至三千万斤粮食，组织灾民、贫民参加运送，以工代赈。八、银行大力举办折实储蓄，并有重点地扶助群众信用合作社，吸收社会游资投入生产。关于解决农业品和副业产品的供销问题，湖北省人民政府决定以五千万斤粮食在山区收购桐油、药材、木耳等山货，在产布的灾区有计划地收购一百万至二百万匹土布，运销于甘肃、陕西、贵州等地，并帮助湖区渔民组织鱼行或合作社推销鱼产。此外，省税务局为发展和推销土产，已定出土产减税办法，呈请中原临时人民政府及中央人民政府批准后施行。会议最后指出，为实现上述生产救灾的方针，只要各地能迅速纠正某些干部存在着对严重灾情漠不关心的麻痹思想和部分灾民的悲观失望的情绪，只要各地适当采取调剂粮食的办法，发动灾民省吃俭用，和大力组织灾民进行生产，一定能够克服严重的灾荒。
