    New Creations in China's Coal Mining Industry
    Li Qingxuan's Two Major Inventions
    In less than a month, he successively invented the medicine pot-style grooving drill and the automatic transportation device, making significant contributions to the country's coal production.
    [Our Northeast News] Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, we will surely break the shackles of capitalist technology, unleash the creative genius of the broad masses of workers, and improve technology without limits. The fact that Li Qingxuan, a technician at the Hegang Coal Mine, successively created and invented the medicine pot-style grooving drill and the reciprocating transport vehicle in less than a month, greatly increasing coal mining productivity, is the best proof of this. In order to improve coal mining and tunneling work and solve many difficulties in drilling and blasting technology, Li Qingxuan, after many efforts and research, finally invented the medicine pot-style grooving drill. Using this type of drill, one shift (nine people) can advance the roadway by up to thirteen meters per day, more than doubling the mine's previous record (six meters). This new type of grooving drill is being increasingly promoted in flat tunnels (made for transportation). However, transportation is still very difficult in upward sloping tunneling faces, and the mined coal cannot be taken out. Because the upward sloping tunneling faces have a gradient, iron rails cannot be laid like in flat tunnels for transporting with coal cars. Currently, Hegang roughly employs three methods: one is for faces with a steep slope, where nothing is installed, and the slope is simply used to slide the coal down with iron shovels; another is for faces with a gentler slope, where clumsy chutes (made of sheet metal in a trough shape, coal is loaded into the trough, and iron shovels are used to push it into the coal cars) are used. When there are no clumsy chutes, sleds are used to pull the coal. All three methods are labor-intensive and have very low efficiency. Using clumsy chutes is the best, but it is also labor-intensive. After blasting, all personnel on the face need to participate in transportation, preventing continuous work. In the past, the productivity was roughly five blasts by three people per shift. At the beginning of the face, one shift could produce eight to ten carloads of coal, but the further the distance, the more difficult the transportation became. At thirty to fifty meters, only three carloads could be produced, and forty meters required six pushes to load a car. Workers complained about the low efficiency and low wages, and many were unwilling to work on upward sloping faces or demanded higher piece rates.
    After many days of research, Li Qingxuan, in consultation with the workers of the 947 face of the No. 2 Inclined Shaft of the Nanshan Mine on December 20th of last year, set up a reciprocating small transport vehicle, which saves both labor and effort, and increases transport capacity threefold. Now, at a distance of fifty meters, one shift has been producing eight to nine carloads of coal. As much as there is, that much can be transported out, making the workers extremely happy.
    The reciprocating automatic transport vehicle equipment consists of laying a double track of the smallest gauge railway on the upward sloping face, driving a prop into the face head, hanging a large rope pulley, installing a brake shoe handle, and using two three-tenths [unit not clear] small iron cars. When the upper car is full, releasing the brake handle allows the heavy car to slide down by itself, and the empty car is pulled up. When the heavy car reaches the face head, there is an automatic door that automatically loads the coal into a large coal car. The transportation time, including loading, is two minutes per cycle, and nine tons of coal can be transported out per hour.
    It is also planned to erect wind boards on the small cars, using the up-and-down reciprocating speed to fan away the blast smoke, which can replace the function of a local fan.
    For this, the Northeast Industrial Department and the Coal Mine Administration have issued bonuses, circulated commendations, and instructed all mine bureaus to widely adopt it. The Northeast Daily also published a commentary, pointing out that only when technicians have a clear idea of serving the people and a correct outlook on life, and maintain close ties with the broad masses, can they make great contributions to the people in their careers. The commentary called on all factory and mine leaders and technicians to learn from the spirit of Li Qingxuan.

    我国采煤事业新创造
    李庆萱两大发明
    不到一个月，他连续发明了药壶式掏槽钎子及自动运输装置，对国家煤业生产贡献甚大。
    【本报东北讯】在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，一定能打破资本主义技术的桎梏，发挥广大职工的创造天才，无限制地提高技术。鹤岗煤矿技术人员李庆萱在不到一个月的时间内，连续创造发明药壶式掏槽钎子及往复式运输车，大大提高了采煤生产率，这就是一个最好的事实证明。李庆萱为了提高采煤掘进工作，解决打眼放炮技术上的许多困难，经过多次努力钻研，终于发明了药壶式掏槽钎子，利用此种钎子打眼，一圆班（九人）每日送道可达十三米，较该矿过去的最高纪录（六米）提高一倍多。此种新式掏槽钎子在平巷（为运搬而做的）已日渐推广。但在上山掘进掌子运搬还很困难，打下煤拿不出来。因上山掘进掌子都有坡度，不能和平巷一样铺铁轨，用煤车运输。鹤岗目前大致采用三种办法：一种是坡度大的掌子，什么也不设备，仅利用坡度，以铁锨往下倒；一种是坡度较小的掌子，采用笨溜子（即用铁皮做成槽形，将煤装入槽里，用铁锨往煤车扒的工具）捣，在没有笨溜子的时候，则用爬犁拉。这三种办法都费人工，而且效率很低。用笨溜子是最好的，但也费工，放炮后全掌子人员都需参加运搬，不能连续工作，以往能率大体上每小班三个人五个炮，在掌子一开始时一小班可以出八——十车煤，距离越远运搬越困难，三十米至五十米就只能出三车煤，四十米就需要捣六次才能装车。工人嫌效率低工资也少，很多人不愿到上山掌子工作，或者要求提高工资单价。
    李庆萱经多天研究，在去年十二月二十号和南山矿十一坑二斜井九四七掌子的工人核计，设置了一个往复式小型运输车，又省工，又省事，运搬能力提高三倍，现在五十米远，一小班已出到八至九车煤，有多少可以运出多少，工人们高兴的了不得。
    往复式自动运输车的设备，在上山掌子里，铺上双轨最小的小铁道，在掌子头打一个顶柱，挂上一个大绳铁轮，按装一个闸瓦把子，用两个三分的小铁车。上面的车装满时，一松闸把子，重车便自己滑下来，空车便被带上去。重车到掌子头，设有自动门将煤自动装入大煤车。运搬时间，带装车两分钟一次，一小时可以运出九吨煤。
    另外准备在小车上立起风板，利用上下往复的速度来扇炮烟，可以代替局部扇风机的作用。
    为此，东北工业部及煤矿管理局特发给奖金，通报表扬，并指令各矿局普遍采用。东北日报亦发表时评，指出：只有在技术人员有了明确地为人民服务的思想和人生观，并与广大群众密切联系的时候，他们才能在事业上对人民作出巨大的贡献。时评号召所有厂矿领导同志和技术人员，学习李庆萱的精神。
