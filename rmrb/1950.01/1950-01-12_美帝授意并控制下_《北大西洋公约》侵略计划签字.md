    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 11th: According to the U.S. State Department, the third meeting of the "North Atlantic Treaty Council," held in Washington on January 6th, has approved the so-called "North Atlantic Regional Defense Plan" and officially signed it. This so-called defense plan was adopted by the signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty at the "Defense Committee" meeting held in Paris on December 1st last year. The meeting was chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, with other countries represented by their ambassadors to the United States. A correspondent for the Norwegian newspaper *Arbeiderbladet* in London revealed that this secret so-called "defense" plan is based on aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Its principle is: "Offense is the best defense." In this "defense" plan, completely instructed by the United States and stipulating that the United States has complete control over the defense sovereignty of other North Atlantic countries, after formal final approval by U.S. President Truman, one hundred million dollars' worth of munitions will soon be shipped from the United States to Europe. The remaining nine hundred million dollars' worth of munitions will only be shipped after the United States and other signatory countries have separately signed "bilateral agreements." So far, due to contradictions between the United States and Britain on this issue, negotiations on the "bilateral agreements" remain deadlocked.

    TASS, citing a report from the Washington correspondent of the Parisian newspaper *Radical*, stated that the so-called "North Atlantic Regional Defense Plan" will assign French troops the task of serving as "shock troops" in a new world war. The purpose of this plan is to establish 30 French divisions, equipped with a small number of fighter planes, radar installations, and speedboat teams. When reporting on the above plan, the Parisian newspaper *Ce Soir* used a large headline, pointing out: "Washington Decides that French Infantry Will Be the First Sacrifices in the Aggression Against the Soviet Union."

    美帝授意并控制下
    《北大西洋公约》侵略计划签字
    【新华社北京十一日电】据美国国务院宣称，一月六日在华盛顿举行的“北大西洋公约理事会”第三次会议，已批准所谓《北大西洋区域防御计划》，并已正式签字，这一所谓防御计划，是由北大西洋公约签字国于去年十二月一日在巴黎举行的“防务委员会”所通过。这次会议由美国国务卿艾奇逊任主席，其他各国则由驻美大使代表参加。挪威《工人报》驻伦敦记者透露：这个秘密的所谓“防御”计划，是以向苏联与人民民主国家实行侵略为基础的。它的原则就是：“进攻是最好的防御”。在这个完全由美国授意并规定由美国全部控制其他北大西洋国家国防主权的“防御”计划，经美国总统杜鲁门作形式上的最后批准后，一亿美元的军火即将自美国启运赴欧洲。其余九亿美元的军火，则尚待美国与其他各签字国分别签订《双边协定》后，方能启运。迄今为止，由于美英间在这一问题上的矛盾，《双边协定》的谈判仍在僵持中。
    据塔斯社引巴黎急进报驻华盛顿记者的报道称：所谓《北大西洋区域防御计划》，将以法国军队在新的世界大战中担任“突击队”的任务。这个计划的目的，在建立法军三十师，并将配备以少数的战斗机、雷达装置和快艇队。巴黎今晚报在报道上项计划时，用特大标题指出：“华盛顿决定以法国步兵为对苏侵略的第一批牺牲者。”
