    Northeast China Cooperatives Actively Purchase Grain for the State
    Signing Contracts with State Purchasing Agencies is the Best Way to Complete Grain Purchase Tasks
    [This Newspaper's Report] Cooperatives in counties of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Songjiang provinces, and in parts of Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces, are actively purchasing grain for the state and promoting the sale of general merchandise to bring currency back into circulation. Many counties have now exceeded their planned purchase targets. The biggest characteristic of this year's grain purchases by cooperatives in various counties is the widespread adoption of the method of signing short-term contracts with state purchasing agencies. According to the purchase achievements of cooperatives in various counties, it has been proven that all those who have used the method of short-term contracts have greatly advanced the completion or exceeded the grain purchase tasks, which not only simplifies the state procurement procedures, but also facilitates planned and unified leadership, ensuring that standard specifications are met. For example, cooperatives in various counties in Heilongjiang Province and many counties in Jilin Province have completed their grain purchase tasks on schedule due to their adherence to contract credit. Particularly commendable is the Erdaogou District Cooperative in Jiutai County, Jilin Province, which exceeded its ten-day contract with the grain company by three times in three days. One of the important reasons for encouraging farmers to enthusiastically sell grain to the state and enabling cooperatives to complete or exceed their grain purchase tasks is that cooperatives in various regions have addressed the farmers' urgent needs for winter clothing, cotton cloth, and daily necessities during grain purchases. Farmers who sell grain can buy cloth, cotton, Ula boots, and other necessities from the cooperative, which in turn enables the immediate return of cash. Due to the cooperatives' correct implementation of the state's grain purchase regulations, they have not only completed their tasks but also obtained legitimate profits, developed their members, and increased capital, laying a good foundation for future development. The number of cooperatives that have developed in grain purchase is the largest in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Songjiang provinces, followed by Liaodong and Liaoxi. In the process of grain purchase, individual cooperatives in various regions have also experienced deviations: some have neglected that cooperatives should be strong assistants to state purchasing agencies and have considered grain purchase not to be a matter for cooperatives, thus failing to act in accordance with contracts, which has affected the completion of tasks by cooperatives. Some have failed to meet the standards stipulated by the state, causing the cooperatives to lose money. In addition, in individual counties, state purchasing agencies have not prepared payments in time, which has also affected the cooperatives' ability to better complete their tasks.

    东北各地合作社积极为国家购粮
    与国家收购机关订立合同是完成购粮任务最好方法
    【本报讯】黑龙江、吉林、松江省各县合作社及辽东、辽西两省部分地区的合作社，积极为国家购粮，并推销百货，使货币回笼，现不少县份已超过了预定的收购任务，各县合作社今年购粮的最大特点，是普遍采取了与国家收购机关订立短期合同的方法。根据各县合作社收购的成绩，证明了凡是运用了短期合同的方法，都大大的提前完成或超过购粮的任务，不仅简化了国家采购的手续，而且便于进行有计划的统一领导，保证达到标准的规格。如黑龙江省各县及吉林省好多县份的合作社，由于遵守合同信用，购粮任务均按期完成，特别值得赞誉的是吉林省九台县二道沟区社，与粮食公司十天的合同三天即超过三倍。鼓励农民向国家踊跃卖粮使合作社完成或超过购粮任务的重要原因之一，是各地合作社在购粮中解决了农民急需的冬衣棉布及生活必需品的要求，农民卖了粮，就能到合作社买布、棉花、靰鞡等必需品，因而又能够使得现款即时回笼。由于合作社正确执行了国家购粮的规定，不仅完成了任务，并且获得正当的利润，发展了社员，增加了资本，给今后的发展，奠定了良好的基础。合作社在购粮中获得发展的数目，以黑龙江、吉林、松江三省为多，辽东、辽西次之。在购粮中各地亦有个别合作社发生偏差：有的忽视合作社应该是国家收购机关的有力助手，而认为购粮不是合作社的事，因而不按合同办事，影响了合作社完成任务。有的不按国家规定的标准，使合作社赔钱，此外还有个别县份国家收购机关货款准备不及时，也影响合作社更好的完成任务。
