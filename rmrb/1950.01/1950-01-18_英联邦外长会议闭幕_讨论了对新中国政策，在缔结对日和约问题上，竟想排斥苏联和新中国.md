Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 17th: The British Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference, held in Colombo, concluded on the 14th after six days of secret discussions. The main issues discussed were: policy towards New China, the Japanese peace treaty, and the so-called "Southeast Asia Anti-Communist and Economic Development" issue. The conference did not pass any executive resolutions, but passed several "recommendations for consideration by Commonwealth governments."

The Colombo Conference discussed policy towards New China on the 10th. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Colombo on the 10th: "Most countries in the British Commonwealth believe that friendly relations and prudent security measures aimed at dealing with the spread of Communism are the best policy towards China." The true meaning of the British Commonwealth's so-called "dealing with the spread of Communism" is well known to the people of Southeast Asian countries. As for the so-called "friendship" with China, this remains to be proven by future facts.

Regarding the Japanese peace treaty, according to a United Press dispatch on the 11th: The Colombo Conference, in a closed-door meeting, agreed to conclude a final peace treaty as soon as possible, in which all countries that fought against Japan should participate. This means that the British Empire group, following the United States, has decided to abandon the procedure of preparing the Japanese peace treaty by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, in order to exclude the Soviet Union and New China. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 11th, the British Commonwealth Foreign Ministers "unanimously believed that the Soviet Union and Communist China seemed to be the main stumbling blocks to the Japanese peace treaty." They also agreed that "the United States must have the decisive say in the Japanese peace treaty" (United Press). From this, we can see the extent of the British Commonwealth's "friendship" towards China.

When discussing the so-called "Southeast Asia Anti-Communist and Economic Development" issue, the Colombo Conference paid special attention to supporting the French puppet Bao Dai and "assisting" Burma. According to a British Information Services message on the 12th: A considerable number of people argued that some form of recognition should be given to the Bao Dai regime, because some countries have established diplomatic relations with China, and recognizing the Bao Dai regime is said to offset "any action that might give any encouragement to forces sympathetic to Communist rule." The conference adopted a recommendation on "Southeast Asia Economic Development," including the establishment of a consultative committee composed of representatives of the governments of the British Commonwealth countries to study common economic issues in Southeast Asia.

During the Foreign Ministers' Conference, economic experts from the British Commonwealth countries also held a meeting to discuss the current and future payment imbalances of the Sterling Area and the recent trends and future prospects of the Sterling Area's export of dollar goods. On these economic issues, according to a United Press dispatch on the 12th, the British group is trying to seize the initiative from the United States by using the British Commonwealth's "Point Four Program" to counter the US "Point Four Program."

    英联邦外长会议闭幕
    讨论了对新中国政策，在缔结对日和约问题上，竟想排斥苏联和新中国
    【新华社北京十七日电】在科伦坡举行的不列颠联邦外长会议，经过六天的秘密讨论之后，已于十四日结束。会议讨论的主要问题是：对新中国的政策问题，对日和约问题以及所谓“东南亚防共及经济发展”问题。会议没有通过执行性的决议，但通过了若干“提交联邦各国政府考虑的建议”。
    科伦坡会议曾于十日讨论了对新中国的政策。据美联社科伦坡十日电称：“不列颠联邦多数国家，都相信友好与旨在对付共产主义蔓延的谨慎的安全的措施，是最好的对华政策。”不列颠联邦所谓“对付共产主义蔓延”的真义如何，是东南亚各国人民所熟知的。至于所谓与中国的“友好”，则有待于未来事实的证明。
    关于对日和约问题，据合众社十一日电称：科伦坡会议在秘密会议中，已同意尽早缔结一切与日本交战国家都应参加的最后的和约。这就是说，英帝国集团追随美国之后，已决定抛弃由四国外长会议准备对日和约的程序，以便排斥苏联和新中国。据美联社十一日电称，不列颠联邦外长们“一致认为苏联和共产党中国，似乎是对日和约的主要绊脚石。”他们又同意，“在对日和约中，有决定性发言权的必须是美国”（合众社）。从这里可以看到不列颠联邦对中国“友好”的程度。
    在讨论所谓“东南亚防共及经济发展”问题时，科伦坡会议特别注意了扶植法国傀儡保大及“援助”缅甸的问题。据英国新闻处十二日消息：有相当多的人主张应给保大政权以某种形式上的承认，原因是若干国家已和中国建立外交关系，而承认保大政权，据说可以抵消“使同情共产党统治的力量，可能得到任何鼓励的行动”。会议通过了“东南亚经济发展”的建议，包括成立一个由不列颠联邦各国政府代表参加的协商委员会，以研究关于东南亚的共同经济问题。
    在外长会议期间，不列颠联邦各国经济专家也同时举行会议，讨论了英镑区域目前和未来的支付差额状况及英镑区域美元货物出口的最近趋势和未来的前景。在这些经济问题上，据合众社十二日电称，英国集团是为了从美国手中夺取主动，以不列颠联邦“第四点计划”，来对抗美国的“第四点计划”。
