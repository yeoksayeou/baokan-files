Beijing 70th Arsenal Sixth Division Runs Training Class
Workers' Technical Level Improves
Learn Several Scientific Calculation Methods
[This newspaper dispatch] The amateur technical training class of the Sixth Division of the Beijing 70th Arsenal started on May 4, 1949. In the past eight months, the technical level of the workers has been significantly improved. For example, in the past, everyone used clumsy methods to calculate change gears, which was very time-consuming. Now, almost everyone can use fraction expansion to calculate gears. In the past, everyone used the three-wire method to measure the size of precision screws (taps, etc.), but they didn't know why. Now, not only do they understand the principle, but they can also use formulas to calculate the effective diameter of the thread. In addition, learning about the principle and usage of turning speed and tool angles, calipers, micrometers, the graduated dial on the handwheel, the principle and calculation method of gear rolling, etc., has greatly helped everyone in improving production. Now, the training class plans to add cultural classes, political classes, and gradually become regularized.

Before the establishment of the training class, general workers often encountered various difficulties in their work due to insufficient technical level, and demanded to learn technical theory and calculation knowledge. At that time, the factory's newspaper, based on the suggestions of the workers, opened a "Mass Technology" column, but the articles introduced were difficult to understand. For example, the formulas used were mostly trigonometric algebra, etc. Only a few comrades with a higher level of education could understand a little, and the rest didn't even know ABCDs, let alone the formula "mother formula", so some comrades suggested that each division run a technical training class. At that time, the Sixth Division was prepared by technician Zhang Delin, hired the technical personnel of the division as teachers, and temporarily borrowed a classroom from the No. 2 Women's Middle School to start school. More than 70 people participated. The subjects were divided into arithmetic, drawing, and working methods. Arithmetic and drawing were divided into elementary and intermediate levels, and working methods were combined. Elementary arithmetic started with the basics of arithmetic, and intermediate arithmetic started with fractions. Elementary drawing started with map reading, and intermediate drawing started with plane geometry drawing. Working methods are determined by the needs of the job. Due to the unsound organization at the time, the textbooks were not unified, and the teaching methods were not practical, so the class became lax soon after it started. In mid-September, it was reorganized, and everyone was mobilized to re-register. At that time, only more than 30 people registered. A small discussion meeting was held on the same day to discuss the reasons for the failure of the training class. Everyone spoke enthusiastically and put forward the following opinions: (1) There were too many meetings, which delayed the learning of technology; (2) The cultural level was inconsistent. The lecture notes were written on the blackboard for everyone to copy. Those who wrote quickly could finish copying, and those who were a little slower could barely copy some, but most people couldn't write at all, so they simply didn't come to study; (3) The teachers had never taught students, and they didn't understand the workers, so they spoke too fast, and it was impossible to digest; (4) In the future, lecture notes must be printed. After the meeting, according to everyone's opinions, lecture notes were printed, and four study group leaders were selected to form four study groups. Since then, the study has persisted and achieved certain results. Up to now, there are 58 students.

    京七十兵工厂六所办学习班
    工人技术水准提高
    学会若干科学计算方法
    【本报讯】京市七十兵工厂第六所业余技术学习班于一九四九年五月四日开课，八个月来，已使工友的技术水平有了显著提高。如挂换轮过去大家全用笨法子来算，很费时间；现在差不多每个人都能用分数的扩分来算轮了。以前大家挑精密的螺丝（丝锥等）用三线法来测量尺度，但不知道是怎么回事；现在不但明白了其中的道理，而且也能用公式算出螺纹有效径的尺度。另外，由于学习了车削速度和刀的角度、卡尺、千分尺的原理和用法、摇把上的刻度盘、牙轮滚动原理和计算法等，使大家在提高生产中得到很大帮助。现在，学习班打算增添文化课、政治课，并逐步走向正规化。
    学习班成立之前，一般工友因技术水平不够，在工作中常遇到种种困难，要求学习技术理论和计算的知识。当时，本厂小报根据工友的建议，辟了一个“大众技术”栏，但所介绍的文章很难懂，如所用的公式多为三角代数等，只有少数文化水准较高的同志还能稍懂，其余的同志甚至连ＡＢＣＤ都不认识，更不用说公式“母式”啦，所以就有的同志建议每所办一个技术学习班。当时六所就由技工张德林筹备，聘本所的技术人员当教员，暂借女二中的教室开学。有七十多人参加。科目分算术、制图、工作法。算术和制图又分初级、中级，工作法合并讲。初级算术是由算术初步学起，中级算术由分数学起。初级制图由识图学起，中级制图由平面几何画开始。工作法配合工作需要定教材。由于当时组织不够健全，教材又不统一，教学方式也不切实，所以上课不久就松懈下来。九月中旬，整顿了一下，发动大家重新登记报名，当时报名的只有三十多位。当天开了一个小型讨论会，讨论学习班搞垮的原因，大家发言很热烈，提出下面几点意见：（一）开会太多，耽误了技术的学习；（二）文化水准不一致，讲义写在黑板上大家来抄，写得快的能抄完，稍慢的还可以凑合抄点，但是大多数人根本不会写，就干脆不来学习啦；（三）教师因为没教过学生，又不了解工人，讲得太快，简直一点消化不了；（四）今后必须印讲义。会后，根据大家的意见，印了讲义，又选出了四个学习小组长，分四个学习小组。此后，学习坚持下来，并获得一定成绩。到现在为止，学员已有五十八人。
