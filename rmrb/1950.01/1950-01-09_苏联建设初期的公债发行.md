    (I) Two Stages of Government Bond Issuance
    The Soviet Union began issuing government bonds in May 1922. Judging from the purpose and nature of the bond issuance, we can divide it into two stages: The first stage was the early stage of construction (from 1922 to 1927). During this period, the issuance of government bonds was mainly fiscal, aiming to curb post-revolutionary inflation, reduce the amount of currency in circulation, stabilize the value of the ruble, and make up for fiscal deficits, so that Soviet finance could have a solid foundation, on which the smooth construction of socialism would be possible. The second stage was from 1927 to the present. During this period, the Soviet Union issued several huge government bonds. The goal of the issuance was no longer to consolidate finances, but to develop the national economy and absorb the idle funds in the hands of the people in order to engage in large-scale construction projects. In the several five-year plans, the issuance of government bonds occupied an important position in expanding the source of funds for various economic sectors.
    Here, we will only talk about the issuance of government bonds in the early stage of Soviet construction.
            (II) Undertaking the Task of Stabilizing the Ruble
    After the victory of the October Revolution, the Soviet regime encountered serious economic difficulties. The imperialist war and the post-revolutionary civil war destroyed the entire national economy; most factories were shut down, agricultural production was low, and there was an extreme shortage of materials in the country.
    Under such circumstances, the Soviet government's finances were extremely difficult. Because the stagnation of industry affected the source of national tax revenue; the operation of state-owned enterprises and transportation undertakings not only could not provide surpluses, but also increased the amount of losses year by year. Therefore, the state budget's revenue was only enough for a very small part of the state's expenditure. In this way, the government could only cope with the difficulties by issuing banknotes.
    As inflation increased, prices rose in a straight line. In 1917, prices increased four times compared with 1913, and increased to 3,136 times in 1920, and as high as 26,500 times in 1921. The actual income from the state's issuance of banknotes also decreased year by year. Taking 1913 as the base period for the commodity price index, the actual value of all circulating banknotes was 2.2 trillion rubles in November 1917, but fell to 488.5 billion rubles in July 1918, and only 29.1 billion rubles in July 1922.
    To restore the economy and transition to peaceful construction, the stability of the currency value is a necessary condition. Because the lack of a currency with a stable value in the circulation process will inevitably reduce the products supplied to the market and the raw materials required by industry, and cause industrial stagnation. Therefore, it is only possible to develop trade and smoothly carry out socialist construction when the value of the ruble can be stabilized for a long time and permanently. Obviously, to stabilize the ruble, it is first necessary to eliminate inflation and balance the state budget. In this way, the economy and finance can be placed on a solid foundation, and then further development can be carried out on this solid foundation.
    The Soviet government resolutely undertook the task of stabilizing the ruble. On the one hand, it adopted many measures to save expenditures. In August 1921, the People's Committee ordered to reduce the supply treatment for civil servants and others, and implemented a strict thrift campaign, temporarily closing those enterprises that were operating at a loss; on the other hand, it tried to increase tax revenue and the income of state-owned enterprises, and restore the destroyed financial institutions. In addition, it was to issue government bonds to make up for the imbalance between income and expenditure. Thanks to these measures, the amount of rubles issued gradually became normal, and the economy achieved initial stability.
            (III) Commodity Bonds and Monetary Bonds
    On May 20, 1922, the Soviet government issued grain bonds in accordance with the resolution of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. This was the first commodity bond issued by the Soviet state, stipulating a total amount of 10 million poods of wheat. When the bonds were sold, they were converted into rubles according to the market price of wheat. Grain bonds could be transferred, and farmers could also use bond coupons to pay taxes in kind. In order to successfully distribute the bonds, the bonds were short-term, and the repayment period started from December 1, 1922, and was cleared by January 30, 1923.
    The reason why bonds were calculated in kind was that the state wanted to protect the interests of the bondholders, so that they would not suffer losses due to currency devaluation. This kind of bond can be sold, and at the same time, when repaying debts in kind (grains), the right to recover the value of the bond coupon is granted. Therefore, the state extracted a part of the currency from the circulation of government bonds to make up for its own expenditures, which also shortened the necessity of issuance. Although the amount of the first government bond of the Soviet state was not large, it played a great role in reducing the issuance of banknotes and stabilizing prices. Because it amounted to 3.8 million rubles in terms of currency (1922 edition), accounting for 25 percent of the average monthly amount of currency in circulation in May 1922. This also reduced the issuance of rubles, and avoided the possible evils caused by the issuance of this amount of rubles.
    The second grain bond was issued on March 22, 1923. The total amount stipulated was 30 million poods of wheat. Bond coupons are divided into three categories, that is, the Soviet territory is divided into three regions, and the price of bond coupons calculated in rubles is stipulated according to the average price of wheat in the three regions. The price of this bond coupon varies according to the price of grain. The principal repayment period of the bond is four months (from November 1, 1923 to March 1, 1924). From 1924, due to the success of the currency reform, repayment in kind was stopped, and repayment in currency was used instead. This bond had great achievements. There was a wide demand for bond coupons among the people. In June 1923, the total amount of bonds increased to 60 million poods of wheat, and in July it increased to 100 million poods.
    On November 15, 1923, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and the People's Committee decided to issue the third commodity bond, namely the sugar bond. The total amount was 1 million poods of refined sugar. The main task of this bond was to prepay the income of the sugar industry. The repayment of the bond was in sugar from February 1 to the end of April 1924, and in currency from May 1 to September 30, 1924. This was the last commodity bond.
    The first monetary bond of the Soviet government was the 1922 National Lottery Bond. The People's Committee decided to issue the National Lottery Bond on October 31, 1922, with a total amount of 100 million gold rubles. The sale and repayment of bonds are carried out in terms of gold rubles at face value converted into gold, or converted into paper rubles according to the exchange rate at that time. The reason for using gold rubles as the face value unit is that the state is to prevent the bondholders from suffering losses due to the devaluation of paper rubles, and to guarantee the actual income of the state budget. The interest rate of the bond coupon is 6% per annum. In addition, bondholders can also participate in lottery draws to win prizes. This bond is long-term with a term of ten years. The repayment period of bond coupons is from December 1, 1928 to December 1, 1932. Lottery draws are held every year during these five years to repay the principal.
    On April 16, 1924, the Soviet government decided to issue the second National Lottery Bond with a term of five years and a total amount of 100 million rubles. After that, the state reissued several guarantee bonds, that is, the government stipulated that state agencies and enterprises must match 8% of the lottery bonds in their own reserves. On February 15, 1924, a guarantee bond with an amount of 100 million rubles was issued, and the repayment period was set as January 1, 1930, with an interest rate of 8%. Government bonds of the same nature were issued three times from 1924 to 1928, with a total amount of 700 million rubles.
    In order to extend the state's credit to the countryside, the government issued government bonds that meet the needs of agricultural residents. This kind of government bond is relatively short-term. The state pays bonuses and interest on these bonds. Bond coupons can be used as collateral for loans from agricultural banks and agricultural credit institutions, and can also be used to pay agricultural taxes. From the latter point of view, farmers' bonds, like commodity bonds, have the nature of prepayment. On March 19, 1924, the Soviet state issued the first farmer bond with a total amount of 50 million rubles and a repayment period of December 31, 1926. The second farmer bond was issued on October 2, 1925, with a total amount of 100 million rubles and a repayment period of November 1, 1927. In addition, farmer bonds were reissued in 1926, with a total amount of 100 million rubles and a term of two years; in 1927, the total amount was 25 million rubles and the term was three years.
    On August 14, 1925, the Soviet government issued a bond to restore agriculture. This was the first attempt to use credit methods to raise funds for large-scale construction. The purpose of the issuance was to use the fixed balance in bank current deposits to engage in large-scale construction in agricultural economy. The total amount of the bond was 300 million rubles, and the repayment period was April 1, 1930. At this time, the goal of issuance has gradually shifted to construction.
            (IV) Three Characteristics of Early Bonds
    The contribution and role of all the above-mentioned bond issuances, especially the bonds in the first few years, to making up for deficits and consolidating finance can be seen from the comparison of the national budget for 1924 and 1923. In the 1923 national budget, the deficit of expenditure exceeding income was 562.8 million rubles; the amount of banknotes made up for was 42.6 million rubles, and the amount of government bonds made up for was 16.3 million rubles. In 1924, the deficit of income and expenditure was 383.6 million rubles. Due to the expansion of national credit, the amount of banknotes made up for was reduced to 180 million rubles, and the amount of government bonds made up for increased to 203.6 million rubles. This means that the issuance of banknotes was reduced by 24.68 million rubles. It can be seen from this that the issuance of early government bonds reduced the amount of currency in circulation, and played a great role in stabilizing the value of the currency; indirectly, it also increased the state's expenditure on restoring the national economy, and created the foundation for further economic development.
    The main characteristics of the issuance of government bonds in the early stage of Soviet construction are three: First, the issued commodity bonds have the nature of currency and perform part of the function of currency. Second, most of the bonds are long-term, which can be said to be a manifestation of the consolidation of the Soviet finance and government foundation. Finally, the bonds are mass-based. In addition to public and private enterprises, bond purchasers are not limited to the wealthy and a few people, but all working people. The number of people who buy government bonds is increasing year by year, which shows the difference in nature between the government bonds issued by the Soviet government and the government bonds of capitalist countries.

    苏联建设初期的公债发行
    张醒石
            （一）发行公债的两个阶段
    苏联自一九二二年五月起开始发行公债。从公债发行的目的和性质言，我们可以将其分成两个阶段：第一个阶段，为建设初期（自一九二二年至一九二七年），在这一时期内，公债发行主要是财政性的，其目标在抑止革命后的通货膨胀，减少通货的流通额，稳定卢布币值和弥补财政赤字，使苏维埃财政有一个稳固的基础，在这基础上，顺利地建设社会主义方为可能。第二个阶段，为自一九二七年至现在。在这个时期，苏联曾经发行几次巨额公债，发行的目标已不是巩固财政，而是在发展国民经济，吸收人民手中的游资，以从事于巨大规模的建设事业。在几个五年计划中，在扩充经济各部门资金的来源上，公债发行更占有重要的位置。
    这里只谈一谈苏联建设初期的公债发行。
            （二）负起稳定卢布的任务
    十月革命胜利以后，苏维埃政权遇到了严重的经济困难。帝国主义战争以及革命后的内战破坏了整个的国民经济；大多数工厂停闭了，农业生产低落了，国内物资是异常缺乏的。
    在这种情形之下，苏维埃政府的财政，极端困难。因为工业的陷于停顿，影响国家税源；国营事业和运输事业的经营，非但不能提供盈余，并且逐年增加亏损数额。所以国家预算的收入只够国家支出的很小部分。这样，政府只能以发行纸币来应付困难。
    随着通货膨胀的增长，物价也就作直线的上升。一九一七年物价较一九一三年增加四倍，到一九二○年增至三千一百三十六倍，一九二一年竟达二万六千五百倍。国家发行钞票的实际收入也在逐年减低。以一九一三年为货品价格指数的基期，全部流通纸币的实际价值在一九一七年十一月为二万二千亿卢布，到一九一八年七月降至四千八百八十五亿卢布，一九二二年七月只有二百九十一亿卢布。
    要恢复经济并且过渡到和平建设，币值的稳定乃是必要的条件。因为流通过程中缺乏有稳定价值的货币，必会减少供给市场的生产品和工业方面所需的原料，并引起工业的停滞。所以，只有在能够长期地和永久地稳定卢布的价值时，方可能发展贸易并顺利地进行社会主义建设。显然的，要稳定卢布，首先要消除通货膨胀，平衡国家预算。如此，才能将经济财政置在牢固的基础上，并在这牢固的基础上再向前发展。
    苏维埃政府坚决地负起了这个稳定卢布的任务。一方面，它采取了许多节约支出的措施，一九二一年八月人民委员会下令减低对公务员等的供给待遇，并且实行严格的节约运动，暂时停闭那些经营亏损的企业；另一方面，它设法增加税收以及国营事业的收入，并恢复被破坏了的财政机构。此外，就是以发行公债来弥补收支的失衡。由于这些措施，卢布的发行额渐趋正常，经济得到了初步的稳定。
            （三）实物公债与货币公债
    一九二二年五月二十日，苏维埃政府根据全俄中央执行委员会的决议，发行谷物公债。这是苏维埃国家发行的第一次实物公债，规定总额为一千万普特小麦。公债出售时以小麦市价折合卢布计算。谷物公债可以转让，农民且能以公债票来缴纳实物税。为要顺利地分派公债，所以公债是短期的，偿还期从一九二二年十二月一日开始，至一九二三年一月三十日还清。
    公债所以用实物计算，乃是国家为了保护公债票持有人的利益，使他们不致因货币贬值而受到损失。这种公债可以出售，同时在用实物（五谷）还债的时候，赋予收回公债票价值的权利。因此，国家就从公债流通中抽出一部货币，以弥补自己的支出，这也就缩短了发行的需要性。苏维埃国家的第一次公债数额虽然不大，然在减缩纸币发行和稳定物价方面起了很大的作用。因为它折合货币计达三百八十万卢布（一九二二年版式），占一九二二年五月流通货币每月平均数额的百分之二十五。这也就是减少卢布发行，并免除此一数额卢布发行时可能引起的恶果。
    第二次谷物公债，发行于一九二三年三月二十二日。规定总额为三千万普特小麦。公债票分为三类，即将苏联领土划分三区，根据三区的小麦平均价格，规定每一地区以卢布计算的公债票价格。此公债票价格乃视谷物价格而变动。公债的还本期为四个月（从一九二三年十一月一日至一九二四年三月一日）。从一九二四年起，由于币制改革的成功，停止实物还债，而改用货币偿还。此次公债有极大的成就。人民对公债票的需求甚广，一九二三年六月公债总额增加到六千万普特的小麦，而到七月时增加到一亿普特。
    一九二三年十一月十五日全俄中央执行委员会及人民委员会决议发行第三次实物公债，即为糖公债。总额为一百万普特精制砂糖。这次公债的主要任务是期前预交制糖工业的收入。公债的偿还，从一九二四年二月一日至四月底是用砂糖，自一九二四年五月一日至九月三十日则改用货币。这是最后一次的实物公债。
    苏维埃政府的第一次货币公债，是一九二二年的国家有奖公债。人民委员会于一九二二年十月三十一日决议发行国家有奖公债，总额是一亿金卢布。公债出卖及还本是按票面金卢布单位折合黄金，或依当时的交换率折合纸卢布进行。以金卢布为票面单位的原因，是国家为预防公债票持有人因纸卢布贬值而受到损失，并保证国家预算的实际收入。公债票利率是年息六分。此外，持券人并可参加抽签得奖。这次公债是长期的，期限十年。公债票偿还时期从一九二八年十二月一日到一九三二年十二月一日，在这五年中每年举行抽签还本。
    一九二四年四月十六日苏维埃政府决议发行第二次国家有奖公债，期限五年，公债总额为一亿卢布。此后，国家复发行了数次保证公债，即政府规定国家机关及企业必须在自己的准备金中搭配百分之八的有奖公债。一九二四年二月十五日发行了数额一亿卢布的保证公债，偿还期限定为一九三○年一月一日，利率八分。同样性质的公债，在一九二四至一九二八年内曾经发行三次，总额达七亿卢布。
    政府为将国家的信用扩展到农村中去，而发行了适应农业居民需要的公债，这种公债是较为短期的。国家对这些公债付给奖金及利息。公债票可以充作农业银行和农业信用机关贷款的抵押，并且亦可用以缴付农业税。从后一点说，农民公债和实物公债一样，带有期前预付的性质。一九二四年三月十九日苏维埃国家发行第一次农民公债，总额五千万卢布，偿还期限为一九二六年十二月三十一日。第二次农民公债发行于一九二五年十月二日，总额一亿卢布，偿还期限为一九二七年十一月一日。此外，一九二六复发行农民公债，总额一亿卢布，期限二年；一九二七年总额二千五百万卢布，期限三年。
    在一九二五年八月十四日苏联政府发行恢复农业公债。这是应用信用方法以筹措大规模建设经费的初次尝试。发行目的是在利用银行活期存款中的固定余额，以大规模从事于农业经济方面的建设。公债总额为三亿卢布，偿还期限为一九三○年四月一日。这时发行目标已渐转为建设了。
            （四）初期公债的三个特征
    所有以上的公债发行，尤其是在起初几年的公债，对于弥补赤字和巩固财政的贡献和作用，可以从一九二四年度与一九二三年度国家预算比较中看出来。一九二三年度国家预算中支出超过收入的赤字为五万六千二百八十万卢布；纸币弥补额为四万二千六百万卢布，公债弥补额为一万六千三百万卢布。而在一九二四年度，收支的赤字三万八千三百六十万卢布，由于国家信用的扩增，纸币弥补额减为一万八千万卢布，公债弥补额增到二万三百六十万卢布。这就是说纸币的发行减少了二万四千六百八十万卢布。由此可见，初期公债的发行减少了通货的流通额，对稳定币值起了极大的作用；间接地它亦增加国家用于恢复国民经济的支出，创立了经济更进一步发展的基础。
    苏联建设初期的公债发行主要特征有三：一、发行的实物公债带有通货的性质，并且担任了一部分货币的功能。二、大部分的公债是长期性的，这可说是表现苏联财政和政府基础的巩固。最后是公债的群众性，除了公私企业外，公债的认购者不限于富翁和少数人，而是全体劳动人民。购买公债的人数在逐年增加，这一点便说明了苏维埃政府发行的公债和资本主义国家公债性质上的差异。
