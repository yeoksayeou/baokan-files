　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: TASS, The Hague: Dutch working people are strengthening their struggle against the military preparations being carried out by the ruling clique. Dockworkers in Rotterdam strongly protested on the 13th against the United States giving war materials to the Netherlands and decided not to unload war materials from the United States.
　　The Rotterdam Peace Committee called on the people to strengthen the struggle, defend peace, and oppose the aggressive "North Atlantic Treaty Organization," stating: "The United States handing over weapons to Marshallized countries is further inciting a new war. We demand bread and peace and resolutely oppose the new war plans of imperialists and adventurers."

    码头工人拒运美帝战争物资
    【新华社北京十五日电】塔斯社海牙讯：荷兰劳动人民正加强斗争，反对统治集团所进行的军事准备。鹿特丹码头工人十三日强力抗议美国把战争物资给予荷兰，并决定不搬卸来自美国的战争物资。
    鹿特丹和平委员会号召人民加强斗争、保卫和平、反对侵略性的“北大西洋公约”称：“美国把武器交给马歇尔化国家，即是进一步促起新战争。我们要求面包与和平，坚决反对帝国主义者和冒险主义者的新战争计划。”
