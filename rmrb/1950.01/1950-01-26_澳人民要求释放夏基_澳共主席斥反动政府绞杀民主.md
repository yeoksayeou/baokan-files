Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 25th: The Australian people have launched a movement demanding the release of Sharkey. According to TASS from Sydney: On the 22nd, a mass rally of 5,000 people was held in Sydney, demanding that the Federal Government release Sharkey, the General Secretary of the Australian Communist Party, who was sentenced to three years in prison on October 17th last year for issuing a statement that "The Australian people will never fight against the Soviet Union." All those present signed a petition. Dixon, Chairman of the Australian Communist Party, declared at the meeting that the Menzies government's threat to declare the Communist Party illegal was an attempt to strangle the people's democratic freedoms. But Dixon pointed out: "No government in Australia has the power to dissolve the Communist Party, because the Communist Party has the great support of the Australian workers and trade union movement. The Australian labor movement will form a united front to resist the government's attack on trade union rights and the legitimate existence of the Communist Party."
    Various trade union leaders also spoke at the meeting, supporting the public's demand for Sharkey's release, and pointed out that the government's attempts to attack trade union rights would be met with the unanimous resistance of the entire labor movement.

    澳人民要求释放夏基
    澳共主席斥反动政府绞杀民主
    【新华社北京二十五日电】澳大利亚人民展开要求释放夏基的运动。据塔斯社悉尼讯：二十二日，悉尼曾举行五千人的群众大会，要求联邦政府释放澳共总书记夏基，夏基是在去年十月十七日因发表“澳大利亚人民将决不对苏作战”的声明而被判处三年徒刑的。到会的人全体在请愿书上签名。澳共主席狄克逊在会上宣称，孟席斯政府威胁要宣布共产党为非法，也就是想绞杀人民的民主自由。但狄克逊指出：“解散共产党不是澳大利亚任何政府的力量所能做到的，因为共产党有着澳大利亚工人和职工会运动的巨大支持。澳大利亚劳工运动将组成一个统一战线，反抗政府对职工会权利及共产党合法存在的进攻。”
    各职工会领袖也在大会上发言，支持公众释放夏基的要求，并指出政府进攻职工会权利的企图，将遇到整个劳工运动的一致抵抗。
