    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th—Only nine days after Truman insisted that the trend of "the first major decline in economic activity since the war" in the United States had been "reversed," the New York stock market erupted in violent fluctuations.

    According to the United Press: "New York stocks suddenly experienced a sharp decline at the close on the 12th, and this trend continued at the opening and after the opening on the 13th. From the end of the fourth hour after the opening on the 12th to the end of the fourth hour on the 13th, the total value of stocks listed on the New York market lost a total of thirty billion US dollars. The scope of the stock decline was so broad and the numbers were so large that financial circles were shocked."

    According to United Press and Reuters: At the opening on the 12th, a wave of selling suddenly hit the market, and the volume of sales was enormous. The number of stocks sold in the last hour of trading on that day was unprecedented in ten years. On the 13th, 3,330,000 shares were traded, the highest record since May 1948, and the first day since May 14, 1948, that three million shares were traded. Within minutes of the opening on the 12th, leading stocks fell by one to three dollars per share, so that the market value of stocks registered on the New York Stock Exchange on that day lost almost fourteen billion dollars, and by the end of the fourth hour on the 13th, the total loss had increased to thirty billion dollars. In this sharp drop in stock prices, small-scale stock traders suffered heavy losses.

    杜鲁门谎言已经戳破纽约股票价格剧跌
    一天里损失三十亿美元
    美金融界人士大为震惊
    【新华社北京十八日电】在杜鲁门硬说美国“战争以来经济活动的第一次大下降”趋势已被“扭转过来”以后的第九天，纽约的股票市场爆发了猛烈的波动。
    据合众社报道：“纽约股票于十二日收盘时突然发生急剧下降，这种趋势继续到十三日开盘时与开盘以后。从十二日开盘后第四小时末尾到十三日第四小时末尾，在纽约市场上挂牌的股票损失价值共达三十亿美元。股票下降的范围是这样的广，数目是这样大，以致金融界人士为之震惊。”
    另据合众社与路透社消息：在十二日开盘时，卖风突然袭击市场，抛售数量巨大，当日最后一小时的交易中所抛出的股票数量，是十年来从未有过的。十三日，市场成交三百三十三万股，为一九四八年五月以来的最高纪录，也是一九四八年五月十四日以来第一天成交三百万股。在十二日开盘以后的几分钟内，领先的股票每股即下跌一至三美元，以致当天纽约股票交易所登记的股票市价，即几乎损失十四亿美元，至十三日第四小时末尾，损失总数更增至三十亿美元。在这次股票急剧跌价中，小规模股票买卖者损失惨重。
