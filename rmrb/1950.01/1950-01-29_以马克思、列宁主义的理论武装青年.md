    Arming Youth with the Theories of Marxism-Leninism
    The Party of Lenin and Stalin has always paid special attention to the communist education of the younger generation of our country. The Communist Youth League is the Party's loyal assistant in the cause of communist education for youth.

    "Now, as the Soviet people are determined to build the great cause of communism—the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) pointed out in its address to the Eleventh Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League—the role of the Communist Youth League should be further strengthened in the communist education of the younger generation. The Communist Youth League must cultivate fearless, strong, optimistic youth who are confident in their own strength, and must cultivate young warriors who are prepared to overcome any difficulties for the freedom and honor of our motherland, for the cause of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, and for the victory of communism."

    The most important task of the Communist Youth League is to use all methods to carry out Marxist-Leninist education among young people.

    Strengthening the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism among young people by all means—is the most important task of the Communist Youth League. Mastering Marxist-Leninist theory and studying the works of Lenin and Stalin has become an urgent need for the entire younger generation of our country. The higher the level of theory and thought of young people, the higher their communist consciousness, the higher their political and labor enthusiasm, and the more effectively they can participate in the construction of communism.

    The Communist Party has created all conditions for our youth to deeply master the Marxist-Leninist doctrines on the laws of social development, the laws of socialist construction, and the victory of communism, and to enable them to learn to apply this doctrine to their own practical work. With the help of Party organizations, a wide-ranging political education network has been established within the Communist Youth League, mainly for studying the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), biographies of Lenin and Stalin, Soviet social and state institutions, and the Communist Youth League charter. The Party also sends experienced cadres to do propaganda work for the Communist Youth League.

    The summary of the 1948-1949 academic year gives a clear idea of the scope of the Communist Youth League's political education. There are more than 23,000 groups and political schools in the political education system of the Communist Youth League, in which about 5 million people are educated.

    An important issue in the political education of young people is to raise the theoretical level and strengthen ideological guidance.

    Currently, the Communist Youth League organization is actively preparing for the new academic year in the Communist Youth League education system. According to the instructions of the Party, the important issues of political education are its theoretical level and ideological guidance. The Communist Youth League organization pays special attention to the work of propaganda cadres.

    In the new academic year, propagandists are clearly improving. Cadres of propagandists with good political preparation will lead political schools and groups. During the summer, a large number of propaganda cadres were trained in workshops held by Party organs at all levels and in regular study groups.

    Many Party organizations are constantly helping the Communist Youth League prepare for the new academic year. For example, in the political schools and groups of the Moscow Communist Youth League, 95 percent of the total number of propagandists are Communist Party members, sent by the Party organization. More than 800 leaders of the Communist Youth League political groups and political schools have been trained in the three-month workshops attached to the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) district committee. The district committee also held two-month workshops for 1,500 propagandists. In Ukraine, seminars for leaders of Communist Youth League propagandist study groups are being held. All leaders of Communist Youth League political schools and groups studying the biographies of Lenin and Stalin are studying in workshops and study groups attached to the Ukrainian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) state, city, and district committees. In Leningrad, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and other Union republics, many study groups have been established for the leaders of Communist Youth League political schools and groups, and they are working successfully.

    Every Party organization must carefully study the work of the Communist Youth League's political education network and help the Communist Youth League organization formulate specific plans to ensure that all Communist Youth League members are attracted to political study and further improve the level of communist education work for young people.

    It should be pointed out that not all Party organizations have provided the necessary assistance to the political education organization of the Youth League. For example, the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Gloningsky State Committee, although it knows that the achievements of political education and the ideological level of learning are primarily determined by the cadres of propagandists, has not equipped the Communist Youth League political schools and groups with experienced cadres. In many places, especially in the Krasnodar Territory, the North Ossetian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan, and in Vladimir, Molotov, and certain other states, the lessons of the Communist Youth League propagandist study groups are conducted at a very low ideological and methodological level.

    The work of the study groups must be effectively strengthened to improve the theoretical level of the propagandists.

    Party organizations at all levels must effectively eliminate these shortcomings, establish supervision of the work of workshops and study groups, and ensure that the lessons of workshops and study groups are conducted at a high ideological and theoretical level. In the study groups, it is necessary to conduct an unusually wide-ranging, lively, and creative discussion on basic theoretical and methodological issues for the propagandists.

    In order to successfully complete its important and glorious tasks, the propagandists of the Communist Youth League must be well-versed in all important events in domestic and foreign life. If they are regularly given reports on the important resolutions of the Party and the government, the domestic and international situation, the current political and economic tasks of the local Party organization, and lectures on current issues in science, literature, and art, then the Party organization is doing very well. In the offices of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) municipal and district committees, more theoretical issues should be discussed with the Communist Youth League propagandists, and methodological assistance should be given to them in preparing lessons, correctly organizing the study schedule, and selecting documents and reference books.

    The study of the Communist Youth League leading cadres should be organized correctly to help them "patiently and persistently study in the Leninist way."

    Correctly organizing the study of the Communist Youth League activists who are doing leadership work has particular importance. Comrade Stalin taught us that if the work of the Communist Youth League activists is not combined with his theoretical knowledge, then it is impossible to understand the communist cause of the Communist Youth League. This combination is not easy, and if it is afraid of this difficulty, then the Communist Youth League will not become a Communist Youth League. Party organizations must constantly help the Communist Youth League activists master Marxist-Leninist theory, following Comrade Stalin's instructions that "patient and persistent Leninist study—this is the road that the Youth League activists should take..."

    Individual Communist Youth League organizations only try to recruit all members into schools and groups, thus showing that they do not pay attention to political self-education, which is the main method for Communist Youth League cadres and young intellectuals to study Marxism-Leninism. This is not right. It is necessary to more widely guide the leading staff of the Youth League to conduct independent study of Marxist-Leninist theory, and guide them to study in Party night schools, Marxism-Leninism colleges, and study groups.

    Publishing relevant learning literature is one of the important conditions for improving the level of political education.

    Publishing learning propaganda literature is an important condition for improving the level of political education. During the summer, many Party organizations often cared about the publication of these documents. The local publishing bureau published more than 600,000 copies of brochures and reference books for Communist Youth League political schools and groups. But this is still not enough. And there is a special need to increase the printing of reference documents in the languages of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) recently adopted a resolution on Party organizations helping the Communist Youth League organization prepare for the new academic year in the political education network. The tireless concern of the Central Committee and Comrade Stalin for the communist education of Soviet youth is clearly manifested here.

    Following the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Party organizations must strive for a new upsurge in all ideological work among young people and strive for a new upsurge in the communist education of the younger generation of Soviet patriots.

### 以马克思、列宁主义的理论武装青年

    以马克思、列宁主义的理论武装青年
    列宁斯大林党从来特别注意以共产主义的精神教育我们国家的青年一代。在青年共产主义教育事业中共产主义青年团是党的忠实助手。
    “现在，当苏联人民决定建设共产主义的伟大任务时——苏联共产党（布）中央委员会在给全苏列宁共青团十一次代表大会的致辞中指出——在青年一代共产主义的教育事业中更要加强共青团的作用。共青团必需培养无畏的、强壮的、乐观的与坚信自己力量的青年，必需培养为我们祖国的自由和荣誉、为列宁斯大林党的事业、为共产主义的胜利而准备克服任何困难的青年战士。”
    共产主义青年团的最重要任务，是用一切方法，在青年中进行马列主义的教育。
    在青年中间要用一切方法加强马克思、列宁主义的宣传——是共青团的最重要任务。掌握马、列主义理论，钻研列宁斯大林的著作，对我们国家整个青年一代说来已经成为迫切的需要。青年的理论、思想的水平，共产主义的觉悟性愈高，他的政治积极性和劳动积极性也就愈高，愈能有成效地参加共产主义的建设。
    共产党创设了一切条件，为了使我们青年深刻精通马列主义关于社会发展规律、社会主义建设的发展规律以及共产主义胜利的学说，并使他们学会运用这个学说到自己的实际事业中去。由于党组织的帮助，在共青团内建立了广泛的政治教育网，主要为研究马列主义经典著作，联共（布）党史、列宁和斯大林传、苏联社会与国家机构、以及共青团团章。党更派出富有经验的干部去做共青团的宣传工作。
    关于共青团政治教育的范围，一九四八年至一九四九年的学年总结给了一明确的观念。在共青团的政治教育系统中有二万三千以上的小组和政治学校，在其中受教育的有五百万人左右。
    在青年的政治教育中，重要的问题是提高理论水平，加强思想指导。
    目前，共青团组织正在积极准备共青团教育系统中的新学年。根据党的指示，政治教育的重要问题，即是它的理论水平与思想指导。对于宣传干部的工作，共青团组织尤其注意。
    在新学年中，宣传员们显然地在提高着。具有很好的政治准备的宣传员干部去领导政治学校和小组。在夏季期间，在各级党机关举办的讲习所中、在经常活动的研究班中大批的培养了宣传干部。
    许多党的组织时刻在帮助共青团准备新的学年。例如，在莫斯科共青团的政治学校和小组中，宣传员总数的百分之九十五都是共产党员，是党组织派来的。共青团政治小组与政治学校中八百以上的领导者都在联共（布）区委会附设的三个月的讲习所中受过训练。区委会为一千五百个宣传员还举办了两个月为期的讲习所。在乌克兰，共青团宣传员的研究班领导者的座谈会正在进行。共青团政治学校与研究列宁、斯大林传记的小组的一切领导者都在乌克兰共产党（布）州委会、市委会和区委会所附设的讲习所和研究班内学习。在列宁格勒、乔治亚、阿塞尔拜疆、卡萨赫以及其他联盟共和国里，为共青团政治学校和小组的领导者们建立了许多研究班，并成功地工作着。
    每个党组织必需细心钻研共青团政治教育网中的工作情况，并帮助共青团组织制定具体方案，以保证能够把一切共青团员吸引到政治学习中去，进一步提高青年共产主义教育工作的水平。
    应该指出，并不是所有的党组织都在青年团的政治教育组织中给与了必要的帮助。例如，联共（布）格洛宁斯基州委会，虽然明知政治教育的成绩、学习的思想水平首先决定于宣传员干部，但对于共青团政治学校和小组竟没有配备有经验的干部。在很多地方，特别在克拉斯诺达尔斯基边区，阿塞尔拜疆社会主义联邦共和国北奥新金斯基，在乌拉基米尔，莫洛托夫与其他某些州，共青团宣传员研究班的功课，都在很低的思想和方法水平上进行着。
    必须有效地加强研究班的工作，以提高宣传员的理论水平。
    各级党的组织必需有效地根除这些缺点，建立讲习所和研究班工作的监督，保证把研究班与讲习所的功课在高度的思想理论水平上进行。在研究班中必需使宣传员们对于基本的理论和方法问题，展开异常广泛的、生动的、创造性的讨论。
    为了成功地完成自己重要的和光荣的任务，共青团的宣传员们必需通晓国内外生活的一切重要事件。如果经常地对他们做些关于党与政府的重要决议、国内和国际形势和地方党组织当前政治经济任务的报告以及科学、文学、艺术目前问题的讲座，那么党组织做的就非常正确。在联共（布）市委会和区委会办公室中对共青团宣传员要多商谈些理论问题，对于他们准备功课、正确地组织学习进度与选择文件和参考书都给以方法上的帮助。
    要正确地组织共青团领导干部的学习，帮助他们能够“耐心地顽强地列宁式的学习。”
    正确地组织作领导工作的共青团积极分子的学习有其特别重要的意义。斯大林同志教导我们说，共青团积极分子的工作如不与他的理论知识结合，那末就没可能理解共青团的共产主义的事业。这个结合是不容易的，如果它害怕这个困难，那末共青团就不成为一个共青团了。党的组织必需时时刻刻地帮助共青团的积极分子掌握马列主义的理论，遵循斯大林同志关于“耐心的与顽强的列宁式的学习——这样的道路是青年团积极分子应走的道路……”的指示。
    个别的共青团组织只尽力将一切团员网罗在学校与小组里，于是表现出不注意政治的自我教育是共青团的干部以及青年知识分子研究马列主义的主要方法。这是不对的。需要更广泛地引导青年团的领导工作人员进行独立的研究马列主义理论，引导他们在党的夜校里、马列主义学院里以及研究班里学习。
    出版有关学习的文献，是提高政治教育水平的重要条件之一。
    出版学习的宣传文献乃是提高政治教育水平的重要条件之一。在夏季期间，很多党的组织经常关心这些文献的出版。地方出版局给共青团政治学校与小组出版了六十万册以上的小册子与参考书。但这还感不足。而特别需要增加印刷苏联各民族语文的参考文件。
    联共（布）中央委员会不久前通过了关于党组织帮助共青团组织准备政治教育网中的新学年。中央委员会和斯大林同志对苏联青年共产主义教育不疲倦的关怀在这里得到鲜明的表现。
    遵循联共（布）中央委员会的指示，党组织必需争取在青年中间一切思想工作的新高涨，争取苏维埃爱国主义者青年一代的共产主义教育的新高涨。
