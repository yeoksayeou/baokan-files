Formulate Provisional Budget Regulations
    Revenue and expenditure should gradually strive for a surplus from achieving a balance; construction costs are invested by the state.

    For decades, old railways had never formulated written budget regulations. The provisional railway budget regulations formulated by the Ministry of Railways this time clearly stipulate that railway budgets are divided into three types: 1. Revenue and expenditure budget. 2. Construction cost budget. 3. Major repair project cost budget (due to undetermined standards, this year it is temporarily included in the revenue and expenditure budget). Revenue and expenditure should gradually strive for a surplus from achieving a balance; construction costs are invested by the state. The two are strictly separated and must not be mixed. The budget preparation procedure is from the bottom up. After being approved by the central government, the Financial Bureau of the Ministry of Railways will uniformly control it, and the relevant business departments will be responsible for inspection, in order to implement the spirit of everyone being responsible and levels being responsible.

    制定预算暂行规程
    营业收支要从做到平衡逐渐争取盈余；建设费由国家投资。
    数十年来旧铁路根本没有制定过成文的预算规章。这次铁道部制定的铁路预算暂行规程，明确规定铁路预算分为三种：一、营业收支预算。二、建设费预算。三、大修工程费预算（因标准未定，今年暂并入营业收支预算）。营业收支要从做到平衡逐渐争取盈余；建设费则由国家投资。两者严格分清，不得互相混用。预算之编造程序是由下而上的，经中央政府批准后，由铁道部财务局统一掌握，各业务主管部门负责检查，以便贯彻人人负责，层层负责的精神。
