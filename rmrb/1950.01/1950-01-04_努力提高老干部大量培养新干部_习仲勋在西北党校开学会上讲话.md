Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 3rd: Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a speech entitled "Strive to Improve Veteran Cadres, Vigorously Train New Cadres" at the opening ceremony of the Northwest Party School on December 9th of last year. The speech is as follows:

Comrades: The task of our Party School is to train and educate cadres. Now is the time to strengthen this work more than ever before. We must not only be good at leading the people in the war of liberation and winning victory, but also be good at leading the people in construction. We must not only have a high tide of economic construction, but also a high tide of cultural construction, which includes the task of theoretical construction. If we do not improve the Marxist-Leninist theoretical level of all party cadres, our party will not be able to shoulder the task of leading the people to consolidate victory and engage in construction. Comrade He Long taught us: all students must become one heart and mind under the goal of wholeheartedly serving the people, abandon all old ideological styles, and establish new ideological styles. He used his own living facts to prove to us that anything old can be transformed, as long as there is determination and courage. He instructed us to study the history of struggle of the Northwest Party, which is a living science of social revolution. We must pay great attention to these instructions and implement them in our future educational work.

In order to make everyone fully understand the importance of the cause of training and educating cadres, it is necessary to explain some relevant situations to everyone. The Northwest is a vast area with a population of more than 23 million, requiring many cadres. However, our original base area had less than one-tenth of the population. The total number of party members in the original base area plus the original underground party members in the newly liberated areas was only about 50,000, accounting for about 0.22% of the total population. Adding the party members in the army, it accounted for about 1% of the total population; among them, only a small portion could be drawn to serve as cadres in various aspects of work; and the number of veteran cadres who could serve as leading backbones in various local works was even smaller. This requires a large number of new cadres to be promoted, trained, and used. Only a few larger cities in the entire Northwest have relatively more veteran cadres; in the vast majority of areas, veteran cadres account for less than 10%, while new cadres account for more than 90%. What methods should our party adopt to lead these vast numbers of new and veteran cadres to complete the tasks assigned to them? In summary, we must implement the following two guidelines:

To lead the vast numbers of new and veteran cadres to complete the tasks assigned to them, we must implement two guidelines: strive to improve veteran cadres and vigorously train new cadres.

The first guideline is to strive to improve veteran cadres. Veteran cadres are few in number, generally have been tested in struggle, have certain work experience, and have the style of maintaining close ties with the masses and being hardworking and simple. They are the backbone of our revolutionary ranks. Veteran cadres have the responsibility to unite and educate new cadres. In all places, veteran cadres must quickly unite with local new cadres, adopt a humble and sincere attitude, promote a democratic style of work, establish harmonious and friendly relations with new cadres, and use their own struggle experience, ideological awareness training, and political cultivation to help new cadres establish a revolutionary outlook on life, abandon old ideological styles, establish new ideological styles, and solve difficulties in work, etc. However, the vast majority of veteran cadres still have very low political and theoretical levels, and cannot raise their practical experience to the level of theoretical principles for understanding and consolidation. Some also show little vigor, a lack of initiative, or have problems with their ideological style. These situations prevent veteran cadres from playing their due role. This presents us with the task of striving to improve veteran cadres. Some organs have absorbed a large number of new cadres to work. When these new cadres first arrived, they were enthusiastic and active, but after a few days, they could not find a clue to their work or a way to do it, and they became depressed and passive. This shows that the veteran cadres in that place have not helped the new cadres well, or do not have enough ability to lead the new cadres forward. All veteran cadres must understand the importance of their responsibilities, strive to learn and make progress, and take the lead for the new cadres. If they walk too slowly, it will hinder the progress of the new cadres, and even put themselves in danger of falling behind. Leading organs must take various measures to improve veteran cadres. Running Party Schools well is an important method. Veteran cadres should be transferred to Party Schools in batches according to plan, giving them one, two, or even three years to systematically study policies and theories. Some also need to study culture, give them better living standards and various conveniences so that they can concentrate on their studies, and establish necessary systems to ensure the implementation of the education plan. The Northwest Bureau is prepared to do this. In the past, we wanted to do this, but the situation did not allow it. Today, we can do it.

The second guideline is to vigorously train new cadres. There are many objects of training, first of all, employee cadres. A large number of talents must be cultivated from the working class to participate in various aspects of work. There are also a large number of young intellectuals, peasant activists, retained former civil servants, and all social figures who are willing to cooperate with us who have newly joined the work. They are large in number, and most of them are enthusiastic and active in participating in revolutionary work. Many of them have various professional knowledge. Only by uniting, training, and using them well can the revolutionary cause be done well. However, generally speaking, the revolutionary outlook on life of these new cadres has not yet been established, or has been initially established but has not yet been consolidated; the ideological boundary between revolution and counter-revolution is not yet clear; some are deeply infected with old ideological styles; some, although they have read some revolutionary books, cannot digest them and cannot combine them with practice. It is easy to talk about revolutionary principles, but it is not easy to put what they say into practice. This shows that profound education and transformation work is needed to make new cadres keep pace with veteran cadres. We adopt a responsible attitude towards all new cadres. We not only want them to have work to do and food to eat, but also to help them advance politically and consciously cultivate them. This is the responsibility of the Party and the responsibility of the People's Government.

The way to realize the two guidelines is to carry out learning movements, organize on-the-job cadre study, and run specialized cadre schools.

These two guidelines are equally important and should not be neglected. The way to realize them is to carry out learning movements. In 1950, we must put cadre education in the most important position and regard it as a central task of our theoretical construction. We must launch a learning movement among all cadres and create a learning upsurge. We must formulate detailed cadre education plans. There must be good leadership. Generally speaking, middle and senior cadres who have practical work experience and a considerable level of culture should seriously study theory and start learning the twelve books designated by Chairman Mao from the beginning. General cadres, especially the vast number of new cadres, should study the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and the experience of the Chinese revolution, and in conjunction with transforming their thinking, select a few books, such as "The History of Social Development" and "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," for intensive study as ideological weapons, correctly use criticism and self-criticism, criticize old ideas, and establish new ideas. With this foundation, it will be easier to study various policies. All cadres, whether new or veteran, who have a low level of culture and cannot read books and newspapers by themselves, must first improve their culture step by step. By absorbing all new and veteran cadres into a large-scale learning movement in this way, this movement will not be limited to next year, but will be adhered to for a long time, and constantly improve the ideological and political level of all cadres. This is the key to our victorious completion of all tasks.

In order to achieve this task, we must universally organize the study of on-the-job cadres. However, it is not enough to have only on-the-job cadre study. There must also be schools that specialize in training and educating cadres. The Party School is the highest institution for training and educating cadres. Under the circumstances that our work is heavy and there are not enough cadres to distribute, we still transfer cadres to school to study, especially in batches to transfer veteran cadres to the Party School to study. There are fewer people in practical work positions, which at first glance seems to be a loss; but from the long-term interests of the entire revolutionary cause, it is absolutely necessary. As long as the purpose of improving the political and theoretical level of cadres is indeed achieved, this temporary loss in practical work will be compensated countless times in the future. There is no doubt about this. The Party School must be run effectively and play a demonstrative role and a leading role in this large-scale Northwest learning movement that mobilizes cadres from all aspects of the Northwest to participate. This requires: first, formulating and implementing correct education policies and detailed education plans; second, all faculty and staff actively working and serving the students well; third, all students studying hard. Studying is the only task of the students of the Party School. Doing these three things well, cherishing precious time, and constantly improving work methods, so that the cadres studying at the Party School can truly learn something within the specified time, and successively cultivate a large number of cadres who can be competent in various aspects of work under the new situation, and then run a good publication, summarize the experience in learning at any time, and systematically introduce it to supply various places for adoption. This is to play a demonstrative role and a leading role in the entire learning movement. Running the Party School well is very important. I hope everyone will study hard and work hard.

    努力提高老干部大量培养新干部
    习仲勋在西北党校开学会上讲话
    迎接经济、文化建设高潮，必须提高全党干部的理论水平。
    【新华社西安三日电】中共中央西北局习仲勋书记于去年十二月九日在中共西北党校开学会上，以“努力提高老干部，大量培养新干部”为题，发表讲演如下：
    同志们：我们党校的任务就是培养和教育干部。现在是比之过去任何时候都要加强这一方面的工作了。我们不仅是要善于领导人民进行解放战争并取得胜利，还要善于领导人民从事建设。我们不仅要有一个经济建设的高潮，同时还要有一个文化建设的高潮，其中就包括有理论建设这个任务。如果不把全党干部的马列主义理论水平提高起来，我们党就不能担负起领导人民巩固胜利、从事建设的事业。贺龙同志教导我们：全体学员都要在全心全意为人民服务这一目标下，变成一条心，要丢弃一切旧的思想作风，建立新的思想作风。他用自己活生生的事实向我们证明，任何旧的东西都是可以改造的，只要有决心和勇气。他指示我们要学习西北党的斗争历史，这是一部社会革命的活的科学。我们必须十分重视这些指示，在今后教育工作中实行起来。
    为了使大家充分明了培养和教育干部事业的重要性，须要把有关这方面的一些情况向大家说清楚。西北是一个广大的地区，人口有两千三百多万，需要很多干部。而我们原来的根据地，则只有不到十分之一的人口，原根据地的党员加上新解放区原有的地下党员总共不过五万人左右，约占全人口千分之二点二，加上部队党员，约占全人口百分之一；其中可抽出担任各方面工作干部的，又只占一小部分；可作为各地工作中领导骨干的老干部，则数量更少。这就必须大批提拔、培养和使用新干部。全西北只有几个较大城市配备老干部比较多一点，极大多数地区老干部不到百分之十，新干部则占百分之九十以上。我们党应当采取什么办法带领这广大的新老干部去完成所规定的任务呢？概括说来，必须实行以下两条方针：
    带领广大新老干部完成所规定的任务，必须实行两条方针：努力提高老干部，大量培养新干部。
    第一条方针，就是要努力提高老干部。老干部数量很少，一般都经过斗争的考验，有一定的工作经验，有联系群众、艰苦朴素的作风，是我们革命队伍中的骨干。老干部有责任团结和教育新干部。在一切地方，老干部都要很快地和当地新干部团结起来，要有谦虚、诚恳的态度，发扬民主作风，与新干部建立起和谐融洽的关系，并拿自己的斗争经验，思想意识的锻炼和政治修养，去帮助新干部确立革命的人生观，丢弃旧的思想作风，建立新的思想作风，解决工作中的困难等。但老干部中极大多数政治、理论水平还很不高，不会把自己的实际经验，提高到理论原则上去认识并巩固起来，有些人还表现朝气不大，进取心不强或思想作风有毛病，这些情况就阻碍着老干部不能起应有的作用。这就向我们提出了努力提高老干部的任务。有些机关吸收了大批新干部工作，这些新干部才来时，都很热情、积极，但过些日子，工作摸不着头绪，找不上做法，就苦闷、消极起来。这就表现出那个地方的老干部没有很好地帮助新干部，或没有足够的能力去带领新干部前进。所有的老干部，要明白自己责任的重大，努力学习求进步，自己要走的快一点，给新干部带头，走得慢了，就会妨碍新干部前进，甚至自己有掉队的危险。领导机关要采取各种办法，提高老干部。办好党校是重要办法。有计划地分批抽调老干部到党校来，给他们一年、二年或至三年的时间，有系统地学政策，学理论，有些人还须学文化，给他们较好的生活待遇，和各种便利条件，使能专心学习，并建立必要的制度，保证教育计划的执行。西北局准备这样办。过去我们想这样办，情况不允许，今天已经可以这样办了。
    第二条方针，是大量培养新干部。培养的对象很多，首先是职工干部，要从工人阶级中间培养出大批人才，参加各方面的工作。还有大批新参加工作的青年知识分子、农民积极分子、留用的旧有公务人员及一切愿与我们合作的社会人士等，他们数量很多，大多数对参加革命工作热情、积极，其中很多人有各种专业知识，只有很好地团结、培养和使用他们，革命的事业，才能办好。但一般说来这些新干部的革命人生观尚未确立，或已初步建立而尚未巩固；对革命与反革命在思想上的界线认识尚不明确；有些人沾染旧的思想作风很深；有些人虽然读了些革命书籍，但还不能消化，不能与实际结合，口里讲革命道理容易，但要按照所讲的见诸实行，就不容易。这说明要进行深刻的教育改造工作，才能使新干部向老干部看齐。我们对所有的新干部是采取负责的态度，不仅要他们有工作做，有饭吃，而且要帮助他们在政治上前进，有意识地培养他们。这是党的责任，也是人民政府的责任。
    实现两条方针的办法，是开展学习运动，组织在职干部学习，举办专门干部学校。
    这两条方针是同时并重，而不能偏废。实现的办法就是开展学习运动。一九五○年我们要把干部教育工作提到最重要的位置，当作我们理论建设的一个中心工作去做。要在全体干部中开展一个学习运动，造成学习热潮。要制定周密的干部教育计划。要有很好的领导。一般的说，凡有实际工作经验，又有相当的文化水准的中级、高级干部，要认真学习理论，将毛主席指定的十二本书，从头学起。一般干部特别是广大的新干部，则应学习马列主义和中国革命经验的基本知识，结合改造思想，选定几本书，如“社会发展史”、“中国革命与中国共产党”等精读细研，作为思想武器，正确运用批评与自我批评，批判旧思想，建立新思想。有了这个基础，再去学习各种政策，就容易了。凡文化水准低不能自己阅读书报的干部，无论新老，都要先按步就班地提高文化。这样把全体新老干部都吸收到大规模的学习运动中来，这个运动不限于明年，而是要长期坚持下去，不断提高全体干部的思想、政治水平，这是我们胜利完成一切任务的关键。
    为实现这个任务，我们就要普遍组织在职干部的学习。但光有在职干部学习还不够，还必须有专门培养教育干部的学校。党校就是培养教育干部的最高学府。我们在工作繁重干部不够分配的情况下，仍然抽调干部到学校学习，特别是分批抽调老干部来党校学习，在实际工作岗位上少了一部分人，骤然看来，好像是一种损失；但从整个革命事业的长远利益着想，则是十分必要的。只要我们提高干部的政治理论水平的目的确实达到了，这种暂时的实际工作上的损失，将来可以得到无数倍的补偿，这一点是无庸怀疑的。党校要切实办好，在这个发动全西北各方面干部都参加的、大规模的西北学习运动中起示范作用，起带头推动作用，这就要：第一、制定并实施正确的教育方针和周密的教育计划；第二、全体教职员积极工作，好好为同学服务；第三、全体同学努力学习。学习是党校同学的唯一任务。做好这三条，珍贵时间，不断改进工作方法，使在党校学习的干部，在规定的时间内，真正学到一些东西，陆续培养出大批在新形势下能胜任各方面工作的干部，再办好一个刊物，将学习中的经验，随时总结，有系统地介绍出去，供给各地采用，这样就是在整个学习运动中起示范作用，起带头推动作用。办好党校很重要，希望大家努力学习，努力工作。
