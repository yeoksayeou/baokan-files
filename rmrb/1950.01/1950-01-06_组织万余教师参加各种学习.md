    Organizing Over Ten Thousand Teachers to Participate in Various Studies
    In order to improve teaching effectiveness, various regions have been utilizing different methods and opportunities to enhance the quality of teachers, with a particular emphasis on improving their cultural and professional capabilities. The in-service teacher training system has been widely established, and many counties have started rotating teacher training programs. During the holidays, various regions held teacher seminars or workshops, mainly organizing teachers to study based on the principle of "learning what is lacking." According to statistics from forty-two counties this autumn, 13,803 teachers participated in studies, either researching primary school textbooks, studying culture and politics, or reviewing work and exchanging teaching experiences to further implement the spirit of the North China Education Conference. Teacher training in the newly liberated areas focused on correcting the influence of their previous feudalistic and fascist ideologies, transforming their attitudes of belittling labor and looking down on the masses, and overcoming their arrogance, with the initial aim of establishing a spirit of serving the people.
    To address the shortage of teachers, various regions have mobilized intellectuals in rural areas to be trained and serve as teachers. After the liberation of major cities, a large number of newly trained intellectuals from the newly liberated areas were sent to the countryside. According to incomplete statistics from Jidong Jian'guo College, North China People's Revolutionary University, North China University, and various normal schools, the total number reached over two thousand. All counties attached great importance to uniting and reforming them, taking care of their lives to ensure they could work well. In addition, to adjust the workforce and strengthen mutual learning between teachers from the old and newly liberated areas, a group of teachers was transferred from the old areas to work in the new areas. For example, Ji'zhong and Ji'dong transferred over one hundred and twenty teachers, which played a significant role in the transformation of schools in the new areas.
    Last year, there were over seventy disaster-stricken counties in Hebei Province. In areas affected by floods, a large number of school buildings collapsed. For example, in five districts of Leting, out of the original 1,943 school buildings, 241 collapsed, and in Jiahe, one-third of the school buildings collapsed. Coupled with the difficult living conditions of the masses, the number of students decreased, and teachers were also emotionally uneasy. The Education Department adopted the principle of integrating disaster area education with production to guide teaching work. For example, most primary schools in the tenth district of Renqiu adopted the method of half-day study and half-day production; Qing, Cang, Jiahe and other counties adopted the method of teaching only the main courses such as Chinese and arithmetic, with the remaining time spent on production. In areas with particularly severe disasters, some schools were temporarily merged. Many teachers shared weal and woe with the peasants, voluntarily reduced their salaries, saved office expenses, and persisted in teaching. In some places where the water was deep and students could not gather at school, teachers went out to conduct mobile teaching. Teachers from schools that were temporarily merged or closed were introduced to normal schools for study or to work in non-disaster areas. Jingxian specifically set up senior normal classes and cultural classes at the normal school to accommodate 120 primary school teachers for study.

    组织万余教师参加各种学习
    为提高教学效果，各地利用了各种方法与机会提高教师质量，特别对文化业务的提高上抓得紧。在职教师的学习制度已普遍建立，很多县并开始了教师轮训。在假期中，各地召开教师座谈会或讲习会，主要根据“缺啥学啥”的精神，组织教员学习。据今秋四十二个县的统计，即有一万三千八百零三名教师参加了学习，或研究小学课本；或学习文化、政治；或检查工作，交流教学经验，以进一步贯彻华北教育会议的精神。新区的教员学习，则着重纠正其以往封建、法西斯思想的影响，转变其轻视劳动看不起群众，自高自大的气习，初步树立为人民服务的思想。
    为解决教员数量的不足，各地分别动员在乡知识分子加以训练担任教师；大城市解放后，经过训练的新区知识分子大批下乡，据冀东建国学院、华北人民革命大学、华北大学及各师范学校不完全统计，共达二千余人。各县都很重视对他们的团结、改造，照顾其生活，使其工作得很好。此外，为调整力量，加强新老区教员的互相学习，曾从老区抽调一批教员到新区工作，如冀中、冀东即抽调出一百二十余人，对新区学校改造上起了很大作用。
    去年河北省灾区达七十余县，受水灾的地方，大量校舍倒塌，如乐亭五个区，原有校舍一、九四三间，塌毁二四一间，交河倒塌校舍三分之一；加以群众生活困难，学生人数减少，教师亦情绪不安。教育厅采取了灾区教育与生产结合的原则指导教学工作，如任邱十区大部小学采取半天学习半天生产方法；青、沧、交河等县采取只教国语算术等主要课程，其余时间生产。在灾情特别严重的地区，则暂时合并了一部分学校。很多教师与农民同甘共苦，自动减薪，节省办公费用，坚持教学；有的地方水深，学生不能齐集学校上课，教师即出动巡回教学。对暂时合并停办的学校教师，则介绍到师范学校学习或赴非灾区工作。景县特在师范设高师班及文化班，以收纳小学教员一百二十人学习。
