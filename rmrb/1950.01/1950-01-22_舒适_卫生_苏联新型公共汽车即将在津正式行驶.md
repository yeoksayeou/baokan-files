New Soviet-made Buses to Officially Run in Tianjin

[This newspaper dispatch] The Tianjin Public Transportation Authority has purchased ten of the latest 1949 ZIS-154 model buses from the Soviet Union. Test runs the other day were successful, and they will soon be officially running in the city. This type of bus is the most comfortable Soviet bus, equipped with air conditioning, heating, and ventilation. The bus body is 9.3 meters long and 2.8 meters wide. The passenger seats are all leather air-cushioned seats, and each seat has a stop bell in front of it. The bus is powered by diesel, and the engine is different from ordinary cars. The sound and vibration are very slight, meeting hygiene requirements.
