    The Supreme Soviet of the USSR is the highest organ of state power in the Soviet Union. It has the power to legislate, amend the Constitution, supervise the implementation of the Constitution, and supervise whether the constitutions of the Union Republics conform to the Constitution of the Soviet Union. It also has the power to approve national budgets and final accounts, determine foreign policy, organize national defense, and lead the Soviet armed forces.

    The Supreme Soviet is composed of two chambers: the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities. Because the Soviet Union is a multi-ethnic country, all ethnic groups have common interests, and the Soviet of the Union represents these common interests. However, each ethnic group also has its own special interests, and the Soviet of Nationalities represents the special interests of each ethnic group. Both chambers are elected every four years. The Soviet of the Union is elected by Soviet citizens according to electoral districts: one representative is elected for every 300,000 people. The Soviet of Nationalities is elected by Soviet citizens according to Union Republics, Autonomous Republics, Autonomous Provinces, and National Districts: each Union Republic elects 25 representatives, each Autonomous Republic elects 11 representatives, each Autonomous Province elects 5 representatives, and each National District elects 1 representative. The term of office for representatives of both chambers is four years. In the 1946 election, the Soviet of the Union elected 1,339 representatives, and the Soviet of Nationalities elected 647 representatives.

    The Supreme Soviet convenes twice a year. When the session is closed, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet exercises its functions and powers. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet is elected from among the representatives at a joint session of the two chambers. It consists of one Chairman, sixteen Vice-Chairmen (one for each Union Republic), one Secretary, and twenty-four members. The Presidium is responsible to the Supreme Soviet.

    The Supreme Soviet of the USSR is elected on the basis of universal, equal, and direct suffrage, by secret ballot. The election of the Supreme Soviet is held throughout the Soviet Union on the same day, and the date must be announced two months before the election day to allow the people of the whole country sufficient time to prepare. On election day, the whole country has a holiday, and the election is held from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight, so that all voters can participate in the election. The election date is determined by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. In the election of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR held on February 10, 1946, the voters who voted accounted for 99.7 percent of all voters. Among the 1,339 representatives, 38 percent were workers, 26 percent were peasants, and 36 percent were intellectuals. Such a high percentage of voters in the election is impossible in any capitalist country. The Soviet Union is the most democratic country in the world.

    苏联最高苏维埃
    苏联最高苏维埃是苏联最高政权机关，有立法、修改宪法、监督宪法的执行以及监督加盟共和国宪法适合苏联宪法的职权，有批准国家预决算、决定外交政策、组织国防及领导苏联武装的职权。
    最高苏维埃是由联盟苏维埃和民族苏维埃两院组成的。由于苏联是多民族的国家，各族人民具有共同的利益，代表这种共同利益的叫联盟苏维埃。但各族人民还有他们每一民族的特殊利益，代表各族特殊利益的叫民族苏维埃。这两院每四年选举一次。联盟苏维埃由苏联公民按选区分别选举：每三十万人口选代表一人；民族苏维埃由苏联公民按加盟共和国、自治共和国、自治省、民族州选出，每加盟共和国选举代表二十五名，每一自治共和国选举代表十一名，每一自治省选举代表五名，每一民族州选举代表一名。两院代表任期均为四年。一九四六年选举时，联盟苏维埃选有代表一三三九名，民族苏维埃选有代表六四七名。
    最高苏维埃每年召开会议两次，当会议闭幕后，即由最高苏维埃主席团行使职权。最高苏维埃主席团是在两院联席会议上由代表中选出。计有主席一人，副主席十六人（每一加盟国一人），秘书一人，委员二十四人。主席团是对最高苏维埃负责。
    苏联最高苏维埃是根据普遍、平等，直接的选举权，用秘密的投票法选出的。最高苏维埃的选举由全苏联于同一日内举行，而该日期必须于选举日的两个月前公布，俾使全国人民有充分的准备时间。选举日全国放假，自上午六时至午夜十二时举行，以便所有选民都能参加选举。选举日期由苏联最高苏维埃主席团确定。一九四六年二月十日举行的苏联最高苏维埃选举，投票的选民占全部选民的百分之九十九·七。一三三九名代表中，百分之三十八是工人，百分之二十六是农民，百分之三十六是知识分子。在选举中投票人数占这样高的百分比，是任何资本主义国家不可能作到的。苏联是世界上最民主的国家。
