    Michurin Society Has Over Two Thousand Members
    Preparing to Convene First Annual Meeting

    [Our Newspaper] In order to combine Michurin's theories with China's agricultural practices, develop a large number of Michurin-oriented workers, and research progressive, mass-based agricultural science, the Michurin Society conducted extensive membership registration last December. As of the end of the year, membership had grown to 2,373, including personnel from agricultural universities, agricultural colleges, farms, forestry farms, livestock farms, forestry schools, and agricultural organizations across the country. These include farmers, workers, students, professors, technicians, and other agricultural workers and primary school teachers. In order to summarize the work of the past year and discuss future work, the Society is actively preparing to convene its first annual meeting, and will invite some farmers and labor heroes to participate. (Note: The Society's address is located within the Agricultural University in the western suburbs of Beijing.)
