    Shijiazhuang Public Factories Draw Nearly 10,000 Workers into New Production Competition
    Rationalization Proposals Encouraged, Inventions Promoted, Product Quantity and Quality Generally Improved
    [Our Newspaper Shijiazhuang Dispatch] Reporter Ai Fang reports: Since the state-owned and public factories in Shijiazhuang launched the third competition campaign on November 15th of last year (note: the first competition campaign in Shijiazhuang was from the end of November of the year before last to mid-January of last year, and the second was the "Red May" competition last year), due to the high morale of all employees, the movement has gradually entered a climax. The units involved in this campaign include the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry's Coking Plant, the North China Highway General Bureau's Transportation Factory, the Railway Machinery Plant and its subordinate production departments, the Shijiazhuang Electric Light Company, the Water Company, and the factories under Yumin, North China, and Zhenhua Companies, a total of 37 units, with nearly 10,000 employees participating.
            Movement Goals:
            Improve technology, improve quality, save raw materials, reduce costs.
    This production competition campaign, after a period of democratization movement in factory management was generally carried out in various factories, summarized and accepted the experience of the previous two competition movements. The overall goals are: improve technology, improve quality, save raw materials, and reduce costs. The competition time is two months.
    In the two years since liberation, the ideological consciousness of Shijiazhuang workers has gradually improved, and they have fully exerted their production enthusiasm and labor zeal. Therefore, at the beginning of this competition campaign, the leadership emphasized the general development of rationalization proposals, promoted inventions, and called on everyone to use their brains to come up with solutions.
            One Month of Competition
            Waste Products Reduced in Various Factories, Raw Materials Saved, Production Exceeded Original Plan.
    In the past month, all factories have made great gains. The waste rate of Transportation Factory products has been reduced from 39.5% in October to the current 15-16%. In terms of output, the three main products exceeded the original plan in the half-month after the start of the competition. The unit man-hours for each product have also been greatly reduced: hook backs have been reduced from 4.7 hours in October to 2.12 hours, ten-wheel tire rims have been reduced from 9.6 hours in October to 8.2 hours, and hook back axles have been reduced from 2.22 hours in October to 1.81 hours. The total actual work hours of the factory were 4306.7 hours, saving 1239.6 hours compared to the original plan. This is the result of the widespread adoption of 51 rationalization proposals put forward by all workers in the factory since the competition began. Various by-products of the Coking Plant have reached the quality standards required by the plan. In the past, the plant produced 100 tons of coke per day, but now it has one more small kiln, producing an additional 2.7 tons per day; the daily output of ammonia water (coke by-product) is 7 kilograms more than before. Since the Water Company launched the competition, the cost of water has gradually decreased, and the cost per ton of water has been reduced by more than 28% compared to October. Workers at the Fengxing Cigarette Factory are earnestly responsible for reducing waste. In the past, 380 cigarettes were produced from one roll of paper, but now 413 cigarettes can be produced from one roll of paper, saving 51.5 catties of paper in half a month, worth 2.575 million yuan. The savings in one month is enough for half a month's wages for all 210 employees of the factory. In half a month, they also saved 3198 catties of coal, and the amount of waste tobacco is constantly decreasing. Other factories have also achieved significant results.
            Reasons for Achievements
            Workers' Production Enthusiasm is High, Tools are Improved and Invented, Labor is Organized Rationally.
    These achievements were obtained from the following three aspects:
    First, studying technology and improving tools. Often, the improvement of a tool can increase production by one to several times. The effect on improving quality and saving is even greater. When the Transportation Factory makes hook back castings, it uses iron molds and hemp paper and masters the iron mold temperature, thus basically eliminating sand holes. The Railway Machinery Plant successfully transformed the lathe substitution machine, increasing the efficiency of turning axles by one time. Miao Dabai, a worker at the Coking Plant, carefully studied the method of burning coke oven rising pipes, and the results were good. Now it only takes 4 hours to burn one, saving 5 times the time compared to before. Now there is a high atmosphere of studying technology in various factories, and they are preparing to establish technical research associations. Due to the continuous improvement and invention of production tools by workers, various factories are constantly breaking through the old production levels.
    Secondly, rationally organize labor and establish sound systems. For example, in terms of scientific division of labor in the Transportation Factory, in the past, one lathe simultaneously turned the inner and outer circles of the expansion ring, but now they are turned separately, increasing efficiency by one time. After the start of the competition campaign, the factory gradually implemented a quota management system. Initially, some production links broke through the old levels, and the uneven development caused the entire production sequence to be disconnected. Later, it was overcome by the "production agreement" method. Now, various factories have generally established an inspection system, registering achievements at any time, summarizing them regularly, fully promoting democracy, and conducting awards in combination with upper and lower levels. In establishing the above various systems, it is necessary to commend the advanced and drive the backward.
    Thirdly, in the competition, the production enthusiasm and serious and responsible attitude of the workers in various factories continue to improve. Because they are more serious and responsible, rationalization proposals are smoothly carried out, inventions continue to emerge, the organization of labor is more rational, and various systems can be realized. Similarly, the constant appearance of new records has further encouraged everyone's morale. Many heroes and models have emerged in various factories.

    石市公营工厂近万职工卷入新的生产竞赛
    开展合理化建议，提倡创造发明，产品数量质量普遍提高。
    【本报石家庄专讯】记者艾方报导：石家庄国营公营工厂自去年十一月十五日展开第三次竞赛运动以来（按：石市第一次竞赛运动为前年十一月底至去年一月中旬，第二次为去年的红五月竞赛），由于全体职工情绪高涨，运动逐步进入高潮。此次卷入运动的计有中央人民政府重工业部炼焦厂、华北公路总局交通工厂、铁路机厂及所属各生产部门、石市电灯公司、自来水公司，以及裕民、华北、振华等公司所属各厂共三十七个单位，参加职工近万名。
            运动目的：
            改进技术，提高质量，节约原料，降低成本。
    这次生产竞赛运动，是在各厂普遍进行了一段工厂管理民主化运动之后，总结并接受了前两次竞赛运动的经验，总的目标是：改进技术，提高质量，节约原料，降低成本。竞赛时间为两个月。
    解放后两年以来，石市职工思想觉悟逐步提高，充分发挥了生产积极性与劳动热忱，因之，这次竞赛运动刚开始，领导上即强调普遍开展合理化建议，提倡创造发明，号召大家用脑筋想办法。
            竞赛一月
            各厂废品减少，原料节省，生产超过原计划。
    一个月来，各厂均有巨大收获。交通工厂产品的废活率，已由十月份的百分之卅九点五，减至目前的百分之十五至十六。在产量上，开始竞赛后的半个月中，三种主要产品都超过了原定计划。每种产品的单位工时也大大缩减，勾背由十月份的四点七小时减至二点一二小时，十轮涨圈由十月份的九点六小时，减至八点二小时；勾背轴由十月份的二点二二小时，减至一点八一小时。全厂实用工四三○六点七小时，较原计划节省工一二三九点六小时。这是该厂自开展竞赛以来，全体工人所提出的五十一条合理化建议被广泛采用的结果。炼焦厂各种副产品都达到了计划要求的质量标准。该厂过去每日出焦百吨，现在多出一个小窑，每日多出两吨七；亚水（炼焦副产品）每日较前多出七公斤。自来水公司自开展竞赛以来，水的成本逐渐降低，每吨水已较十月份成本降低百分之二十八多。风行烟厂工人认真负责减少浪费，过去一盘纸出三百八十条烟，现在一盘纸可出四百一十三条烟，半月即节约五十一斤半盘纸，值二百五十七万五千元，一个月的节省，可够全厂二百一十个职工半月的工资；半月中并节省煤炭三千一百九十八斤，废烟不断减少。其他各厂，成绩都很显著。
            获得成绩原因
            工人生产情绪高，改进发明工具，合理组织劳力。
    这些成绩是从以下三方面获得的：
    第一、钻研技术，改进工具。往往由于一件工具的改进，而使生产量提高一倍至数倍。在质量的提高以及节约上作用更大，交通工厂制勾背铸品时，改用铁模和麻纸，掌握铁模温度，因而基本上消灭了砂气眼。铁路机厂改造镟车代用机成功，使镟车轴的效率提高了一倍。炼焦厂工人苗大白，精心研究烧焦炉上升管的方法，结果良好，现只四小时即可烧好一个，较前节省了五倍时间。现各厂研究技术的空气很高，纷纷酝酿建立技术研究会。由于工人不断改进和发明生产工具，各厂正不断地突破旧的生产水平。
    其次，合理组织劳力，建立健全各种制度。如交通工厂在科学分工方面，过去一个车床同时镟涨圈里外圆，现在分开镟，效率提高一倍。该厂竞赛运动开始之后，即逐步的实行了定额管理的制度。起初，某些生产环节突破旧的水平，因为发展不平衡引起整个生产序列不衔接现象，后来以“生产协定”的办法克服了。现各厂普遍建立了检查制度，随时登记成绩，定期总结，充分发扬民主，上下结合进行评奖。在树立以上各种制度中作到表扬先进的，带动落后的。
    第三，在竞赛中，各厂工人的生产热忱及认真负责的态度继续不断的提高。由于更加认真负责，因之使合理化建议顺利开展，创造发明不断出现，劳动力的组织更加合理，各种制度得以实现。同样，也由于新纪录的不断出现，更加鼓舞了大家的情绪。各厂均涌现出不少的英雄模范。
