Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 14th. Consolidated TASS Rome dispatches: The Italian Gasperi cabinet submitted its general resignation on the 12th. Italian President Einaudi has begun "consultations" with Senator Nicola, and the speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives. It is generally believed that the Gasperi cabinet's hasty resignation was due to two reasons.

	First, House Speaker Gronchi announced on the 7th that Parliament would convene on January 16th. At that time, Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti pointed out that when the Gasperi cabinet experienced a crisis last November due to the resignation of three ministers from the Saragat Party, Gasperi had promised Parliament that the government would reorganize before Parliament reconvened, thereby obtaining a vote of confidence from Parliament. Secondly, the situation created by the Modena bloodbath caused the opposition party to demand a special session of Parliament. The Gasperi government, in crisis, clearly attempted to avoid discussing the Modena incident, and therefore was forced to abandon its desire to adjust the cabinet without going through Parliament, and submitted its general resignation.

    逃避讨论摩登纳事件
    加斯贝利内阁辞职
    【新华社北京十四日电】综合塔斯社罗马消息：意大利加斯贝利内阁十二日提出总辞职。意总统伊诺第已开始与参议员尼古拉，参、众两院议长等进行“协商”。一般相信，加斯贝利内阁的匆匆辞职系由于两个原因。
    一为众院议长格朗基已于七日宣布在一月十六日召开议会。当时意共领袖托里亚蒂即指出，去年十一月加斯贝利内阁因萨拉盖特党的三个部长辞职而发生危机时，加斯贝利曾向议会许诺，政府将在议会复会前实行改组，从而获得议会信任票。其次因摩登纳血案所造成的情势，使反对党要求召开议会特别会议。处在危机中的加斯贝利政府，显然企图避免讨论摩登纳事件，因此被迫放弃其不经过议会而调整内阁的愿望，提出了总辞职。
