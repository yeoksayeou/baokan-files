    Unite Private Shipping Industry to Complete Material Exchange Tasks
    Central China Forms Six Shipping Joint Offices
    [By Our Correspondent] Since December of last year, the shipping station of the Central China Transportation Company has been organizing joint shipping organizations in Wuhan. To date, it has formed six joint offices: Datong, Minjian, Silian, Jianghan, Dongnan, and Jianhang. These include 65 passenger and cargo ships, totaling 468,454 tons, and 67 tugboats, with a towing capacity of 172,000 tons upstream (doubled downstream). The remaining shipping companies are also being organized. This provides a strong guarantee for uniting the private transportation industry and jointly completing the task of material exchange in the future.
    In order to overcome the previous organizational chaos in Wuhan's shipping industry, leverage collective strength, and complete transportation tasks, the company has been conducting in-depth investigations, understanding, and persuasive education work in the shipping industry since December of last year. It has also convened small meetings with three to five shipping companies to discuss how to organize shipping forces and complete transportation tasks under the principle of considering both public and private interests. After discussions by shipping industry representatives and members of the trade association in two meetings, it was unanimously agreed that joint shipping organizations should be established as soon as possible. As a result of these efforts, the six joint offices, including Datong, have been formally established. In the future, after the various specialized companies in Central China hand over water transportation materials to the shipping station of the Central China Transportation Company, they will be uniformly distributed according to the then-current ship movement conditions of each joint office. Materials within 100 tons will be carried by passenger and cargo liners; materials within 1,000 tons will be allocated in shifts, with the order determined by drawing lots; materials within 10,000 tons will be distributed proportionally by each joint office; and materials exceeding 10,000 tons will be determined by each joint office through research. As for general freight rates, they are also jointly agreed to be calculated at 80% of the standard stipulated by the Central China Shipping Administration Bureau, with unified freight rates.
    In order to ensure the smooth completion of transportation tasks, it is also specifically stipulated that the shipping companies participating in the joint organization must have been registered with the Central China Shipping Administration Bureau and the Industry and Commerce Bureau, and have joined the trade association. Any shipping company that meets these conditions and has a transportation capacity of approximately 1,000 tons can participate, regardless of the number of companies involved. The joint office will be staffed by companies taking turns to be on duty, without setting up separate institutions and personnel, in order to reduce expenses.

    团结私营航运业完成交流物资任务
    华中组成六个航运联营处
    【本报讯】华中运输公司航运站，自去年十二月着手组织武汉航运联营机构以来，到目前为止，已组成了大同、民建、四联、江汉、东南、建航等六个联营处，共计有客货轮六十五只，四六八、四五四总吨，拖轮六十七只，拖力上水一七二、○○总吨（下水加一倍）。其余各轮船公司，亦在陆续组织中。对今后团结私营运输业，共同完成物资交流任务，提供了有力保证。
    该公司为克服武汉航业界以往存在的组织上混乱现象，发挥集体力量，完成运输任务，从去年十二月起，即深入航业界进行调查了解和说服教育工作，并连续召集三五家轮船公司开小型会议，商讨如何把航运力量组织起来，在公私兼顾原则下，完成运输任务。复经航业界代表和同业公会会员两次开会讨论，一致以为应尽速组织航运联营机构。经努力结果，正式组成现在的大同等六个联营处。今后华中各专业公司属于水运物资交给华中运输公司航运站后，即按当时各联营处船舶动态情况，统一分配；凡百吨以内物资，由客货班轮随带；千吨以内物资，轮班分配，用抽签方式决定次序；万吨以内物资，由各联营处按比例分配；超过万吨物资，由各联营处研究决定。至于一般运费；亦共同议定根据华中航政局规定标准，八折计算，统一运价。
    为保证顺利完成运输任务，又特别规定，参加联营组织的轮船公司，必须曾在华中航政局备案，工商局登记，和已加入同业公会者。凡具有上面这些条件的轮船公司，有运输力量达一千吨左右者，不论其公司的家数多少均可参加。联营处由参加的公司轮值办公，不另设机构与人员，以减少开支。
