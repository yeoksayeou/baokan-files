    [Beijing News] The North China Health Cadre Conference, jointly convened by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Health of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and the Health Department of the North China Military Region, was held in Beijing on the 15th. Approximately 500 leading cadres from the central Ministry of Health, the health departments of the five provinces and two municipalities of North China, and the health departments affiliated with the Military Commission attended. Guo Moruo, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government's State Council, also attended to provide guidance.

    The conference began at 9:00 AM. Li Dequan, Minister of Health of the Central People's Government, announced the opening of the conference, and pointed out that the main task of the conference was to convey the resolutions of the first National Health Administration Conference held last autumn. Following this, Director Guo Moruo delivered a speech.

    In his speech, Director Guo concretely explained that the principles of "prevention first, medical treatment as supplementary" and "strengthening the training of health personnel," decided at the first National Health Administration Conference last autumn, were extremely important and in line with the actual conditions of Chinese society. He expressed his hope that after this communication, attendees would further disseminate these resolutions to lower levels and extensively mobilize health workers across the country to smoothly implement these resolutions. Director Guo pointed out that China's most important task at present is to restore and develop production, but this can only be guaranteed if health work across the country is done well, and the working people have sufficient health. Director Guo also put forward four points for attention as instructions and expectations for health workers across the country: consolidating the unity of health workers, clarifying the viewpoint of serving the people, following the mass line, and learning from the administrative and technical experience of Soviet medicine.

    Following this, the main agenda of the conference commenced, with He Cheng, Vice Minister of Health of the Central People's Government and Minister of Health of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, delivering a report on conveying the important resolutions of the first National Health Administration Conference last year.

            Three Objectives of Last Autumn's National Health Administration Conference

    Vice Minister He first explained that last year's Health Administration Conference had three objectives: (1) to study the principles and tasks of national local health and military health; (2) to understand the status of health cadres in various regions and recruit personnel to organize central and provincial health institutions; and (3) to study the convening of a national health conference this year. Vice Minister He explained that the Health Administration Conference discussed issues such as public health, medical education, health cadres, military health work, and pharmaceuticals, and made preliminary resolutions. He pointed out that these resolutions still hoped that health workers from all sides would offer opinions and bring them to the national health conference this summer for discussion before making a decision on the guiding principles and tasks of national health work in the future. Next, Vice Minister He Cheng gave a detailed report on the discussions and resolutions of the National Health Administration Conference last year on public health, medical education, health cadres, pharmaceuticals, and other issues.

    Starting tomorrow, the three units—the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Health of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and the Health Department of the North China Military Region—will hold separate meetings to discuss Vice Minister He Cheng's report. They will also discuss the work plans of each unit for 1950 in accordance with the spirit of this report. The conference is scheduled to conclude in five days.
