Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: TASS, Paris: The French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) published a communique on the 9th discussing the situation after the French National Assembly passed collective contract negotiations. The CGT leaders believe that the fact that a large majority in the National Assembly rejected the compulsory arbitration clause in the government's proposed bill is a great achievement of the united action of the working people.

The communique continued: CGT leaders protested against the National Assembly's rejection of the proposal to automatically extend collective contracts to all industries, and called on all trade unions to spare no effort to seek amendments to the bill when it returns to the National Assembly from the Senate of the Republic.

The communique exposed the government's attempt to interfere in determining the guaranteed minimum wage in order to maintain a meager wage level. CGT leaders believe that the minimum wage set in France so far cannot be used as the basis for determining the guaranteed minimum wage. Workers' wages must never be just a limited meager income, but should continuously improve the living standards of the working people.

The communique emphasized that as long as all working people strengthen and expand the unity of action, they will be able to achieve solutions favorable to workers on these and all other issues concerning collective contracts. Therefore, it calls on all working people in France to strengthen unity in all enterprises.

    法总工会号召工人团结
    争取将集体合同扩大到一切工业
    【新华社北京十日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：法国总工会九日发表公报，讨论法国国民议会通过集体合同谈判后的形势。总工会领袖认为：国民议会中颇大的多数，都拒绝了政府所提法案中强迫仲裁条款一事，是劳动人民行动统一的巨大成就。
    公报继称：总工会领袖抗议国民议会否决把集体合同自动扩大到一切工业的建议，并号召一切工会不遗余力，争取在关于这个问题的法案自共和国参议院回到国民议会时，加以修正。
    公报揭露政府力图干涉确定有保证的最低工资问题，以保持工资的微薄水平。总工会领袖认为，法国迄今以前所定的最低工资，不能作为确定有保证的最低工资的基础。工人的工资决不能只是有限的微薄收入，而应该不断提高劳动人民的生活水平。
    公报强调指出：只要全体劳动人民加强和扩大行动的团结，就能够在这些和其他一切关于集体合同的问题上，取得有利于工人的解决。因此号召法国全体劳动人民，在一切企业中加强团结。
