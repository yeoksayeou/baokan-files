Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 30th - The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has advanced to the east of Kunming, capturing over 4,000 enemy troops along the way. On the 18th of this month, Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandit troops, the 8th Army under Li Mi and the 26th Army under Yu Chengwan, disobeyed the command of Chairman Lu Han of Yunnan and brazenly attacked Kunming. Upon receiving a report from Chairman Lu, the Southwest Front Command of the PLA, Generals Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping, immediately ordered the main force of the PLA stationed in Guizhou to rush to support from Bijie and Anshun day and night. This large army entering Yunnan successively captured the three county towns of Zhanyi, Qujing, and Luliang to the northeast and east of Kunming from the 23rd to the 25th. They intercepted a portion of the enemy fleeing south at Tianshengqiao, southwest of Zhanyi and Luliang, successively annihilating the remnant troops of the 19th Army under He Shaozhou, the 3rd Division of the 8th Army, the Gendarmerie Regiment of the Army Headquarters, the 15th and 17th Transportation Regiments, the Guard Regiment Officer Team, and a portion of the Artillery School, capturing over 4,000 enemy troops and seizing over 250 vehicles.

Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 31st - During the great encirclement and annihilation battle on the outskirts of Chengdu, Chiang-Hu bandit troops are surrendering in droves. Most of them have been without food or sleep for two or three days and nights, exhausted by terror, hunger, disease, and fatigue, and in a terrible state. As a result, they fall asleep as soon as they enter the prisoner-of-war camp, and devour anything they can eat. The bandit troop designations of the captured enemy are extremely disorganized. In one instance, a reconnaissance company of a certain unit captured more than 300 bandit troops, including soldiers from eight armies: the 1st, 3rd, 15th, 27th, 36th, 57th, 90th, and 114th. According to the prisoners, after the liberation of Xinjin, the remnant bandit troops scattered everywhere, but wherever they ran, the sound of the PLA's guns followed, as if it were their own shadow that they could not shake off. Therefore, the bandit troops were all extremely panicked, and would fall into chaos without a fight at the sound of gunfire. A soldier from the 57th Army said, "What's the point of fighting? The officials have run away, flown away, are the soldiers supposed to wait to die?"

    成都围歼战中散匪结队投降
    【新华社西南前线三十日电】人民解放军某部已进抵昆明以东，沿途俘敌四千余人。本月十八日，蒋匪残部第八军李弥部及二十六军余程万部，不服从云南卢汉主席之指挥，悍然向昆明进攻。人民解放军西南前线司令部刘伯承、邓小平两将军接获卢主席报告后，即日命令人民解放军驻贵州之主力部队分由毕节、安顺两地星夜兼程驰援。此路入滇大军于二十三至二十五日连续攻占昆明东北及以东之沾益、曲靖、陆良等三座县城，并在沾益及陆良西南之天生桥截住南逃之敌一部，先后歼灭其十九兵团何绍周残部八军之三师，陆军总部之宪兵团、辎汽十五与十七两团、警卫团军官队及炮兵学校等各一部，共俘敌四千余人，缴汽车二百五十余辆。
    【新华社西南前线三十一日电】成都外围大歼灭战中，蒋胡匪军成群结队地放下武器投降。他们大多已有两天三夜未吃未睡，被惊恐、饥饿、疾病、疲乏弄得筋疲力竭，狼狈不堪，以致一进俘虏收容所的门便倒下大睡，见到能吃的东西就放口大嚼，被俘匪军番号极乱，某部侦察连在一次俘虏的三百多匪军中，竟有一、三、十五、二十七、三十六、五十七、九十、一一四等八个军的番号。据俘虏称：新津解放后，残匪各部即到处流窜，但跑到那里，解放军的枪声就响到那里，仿佛像自己的影子一样无法摆脱，因此匪军无不惊慌异常，一听枪声就不战自乱了。一个五十七军的士兵说：“打，还打啥呢，当官的跑的跑了，飞的飞了，当兵的就活该等死吗？”
