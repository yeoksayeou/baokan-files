Northeast Federation of Trade Unions Discusses Experiences of Public Enterprises
Decides to Promote the Signing of Collective and Contact Contracts
The main conditions for signing a collective contract should be a more realistic production plan and a more adequate mobilization of the masses. After signing a collective contract or a contact contract, it is very helpful to develop production, improve management, and promote the role of the trade union in facing production.
[Reported by this newspaper] The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions held a symposium on December 22nd of last year to discuss the issue of signing collective contracts and contact contracts in public enterprises. More than 20 trade union cadres from various state-owned and public enterprises in Dalian, Changchun, Fushun, Shenyang, Fuxin, and Andong, who had signed contracts, participated in the symposium. The Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government also sent representatives to participate. The meeting made the following conclusions:
(1) Signing collective contracts or contact contracts has played a significant role in both developing production and promoting the record-breaking movement. According to incomplete statistics, collective contracts have been signed by 22 enterprises in the Lushun-Dalian area, Shenyang First, Third, and Fifth Machine Factories, Jilin Shiyan Paper Mill, Changchun Municipal Enterprise Gas Plant, Water Plant, Tram Plant, Heilongjiang Suileng Lumber Mill, Heilongjiang Alkali Plant, and other units. Contact contracts have been signed by Shenyang Woolen Mill, Rubber Factory No. 1, Kaiguo Rolling Stock Factory, and Andong Paper Mill (which also signed a collective contract in December). Experiences from various places have proved that signing collective contracts or contact contracts is the best organizational means to further mobilize the masses, increase production, and improve management. Shenyang Woolen Mill signed a contact contract in November and exceeded the production target by 1.44%, reversing the situation where the factory had failed to complete its tasks for half a year, and guaranteeing quality. Shiyan Paper Mill had never completed the production tasks for sulfite pulp and groundwood pulp in the first three quarters, but exceeded the task after signing a collective contract in October. Other examples, such as the Third Machine Factory and the deep section of Fushun Open-Pit Mine, have achieved outstanding results in production after signing collective contracts. Generally, after signing collective contracts and contact contracts, factory directors were able to free themselves from the working methods of handicraft-style administration, and could actively and flexibly grasp the key points, go deep into the field to discover and solve problems, plan, arrange, and check the overall work, and promote the progress of management systems and management personnel. Trade union cadres also clarified their independent work and business, and found a specific path for trade union work to face production. In tracing the reasons for these achievements, the meeting unanimously agreed that this was because the signing of collective contracts and contact contracts further implemented the policies of democratic management and consideration of both public and private interests; it strengthened the connection between different types of work and procedures, and strengthened the unity among employees; it enabled all employees to work together for a common goal—to implement the provisions of the contract; it improved the working methods of the trade union, making the work of the trade union further integrated with production, thereby strengthening the connection between the trade union and the masses of employees, improving the organization, and thereby increasing the recognition of the trade union by the masses of employees.

Contact contracts should address the problems existing in each workshop, mutually guaranteeing the quantity, quality, and time of products.
(2) Contact contracts are agreements made to closely organize various types of work and procedures, and to enable advanced workshops to drive backward workshops, under the conditions of uneven mass mobilization and uneven development of new records, and under the conditions that the factory management system is not yet sound. It is an organizational means to ensure the completion of production tasks. Therefore, contact contracts should address the problems existing between workshops, mutually guaranteeing the quantity, quality, and time of products. Currently, some contact contracts have developed into production departments and administrative management departments signing contact contracts. Some factories give honor awards (such as various red flags, etc.) to workshops that guarantee well after signing contact contracts, while Andong Paper Mill has stipulated material reward and punishment measures. After signing contact contracts, if a workshop exceeds the national production target and guarantees well, the factory will give extra bonuses; those who do not guarantee well will have a portion deducted from their excess bonus. The meeting believes that these methods can be promoted. The signing of contact contracts should be researched by the trade union and the administration, and then organized and led by the trade union. The workshop director or foreman and the trade union leader of the workshop jointly sign on behalf of all workshop employees. Andong Paper Mill and Shenyang Woolen Mill have better experiences in organizing the signing of contact contracts. The Woolen Mill, after research and discussion by Party, government, and trade union cadres, mobilized the employees, and the trade union organized the workers in each workshop to draft the content of the contract themselves, and the trade union organized the review and correction. The contact contracts of Andong Paper Mill were first signed in key workshops—the wood cooking room, the paper making room, and several related workshops, and then they were signed with other workshops that had mutual connections. Because contact contracts are a mutual guarantee between employees, they are different from collective contracts. They cannot reflect the overall production goals and the various guarantees required to complete production tasks, nor can they completely solve the problems of considering both public and private interests and stipulating the rights and obligations of the administration and the trade union; however, because they are suitable for solving the current widespread phenomenon of disconnection in production, they should still be widely promoted. Moreover, after the widespread promotion of contact contracts, they will inevitably develop in the direction of collective contracts.

Sign different specific contracts according to different specific conditions
(3) A collective contract is a contract signed by the trade union, representing all employees, and the enterprise administration, representing the state, to jointly achieve and exceed production tasks, implement consideration of both public and private interests, and clarify responsibilities. Therefore, it should be signed by the trade union and the administration. It is inappropriate for some factories to have contracts signed between workers and the management committee. The existing collective contracts in various places have the following forms: (1) Enterprises in the Lushun-Dalian area have relatively mature conditions for production development and enterprise management in all aspects, so the content of the collective contracts is relatively complete and the effective term of the contract is relatively long, generally one year. (2) In the case where the general production quota wage system is still changing, a short-term collective contract should be signed first, such as in the Shenyang Third Machine Factory, the content of which is still very incomplete and the effective period is short—one month or two months. (3) A collective contract signed individually by a workshop, a production department, or a pit with the administration, such as the manufacturing department and boiler department of the Changchun Gas Plant (the first month to gain experience from one workshop, and the second month to sign a collective contract for the entire factory), the rock road entrance of the Fushun Victory Mine, and the Xiaohangshan No. 1 Pit of Jixi. (4) A collective contract with the nature of contracting work, applicable to restoration projects, such as the collective contract of the deep section of the Fushun Open-Pit Mine. These situations illustrate that the content of the collective contract can be detailed or simple, the duration can be long or short, and the scope can be wide or narrow, but the rights and obligations of both the administration and the trade union must be clearly stipulated. Experience has shown that regardless of the form, the signing of a collective contract has mobilized the masses and achieved good results. Signing a collective contract requires certain conditions: such as a relatively realistic production plan, clear reward methods, and a relatively full mobilization of the masses, etc., but the most important condition is whether the leaders attach importance to the role of the collective contract. According to the current situation, the conditions for signing a collective contract are initially available in many factories and mines. Therefore, all localities should pay attention to these experiences and actively start trial implementation. However, it must be noted that the content of the contract should be determined according to the actual situation and the degree of preparation. How much can be stipulated should be stipulated, and those that cannot be stipulated should not be stipulated for the time being. The term should generally not be too long. The content of the contract can also be gradually enriched or made more specific and detailed with the development of production and the record-breaking movement. According to existing experience, the content of a collective contract should generally include: production tasks, administrative guarantee matters, trade union leadership's guarantee matters for all employees, reward and punishment methods, and conciliation committee, etc. After signing a collective contract, workshop contact contracts are generally still necessary to ensure the implementation of the collective contract. The top-down industry-wide collective contract system should become the common goal of various public enterprise administrations and companies and the industry's general trade union, striving for its early realization.

Leaders should pay attention
Signing contracts should fully promote democracy; implement democratic management, develop production; and should conduct regular inspections with a serious and responsible attitude.
Finally, regarding the leadership issue of signing contracts, the meeting proposed: First, the leadership's thinking must be clear that the purpose of signing contracts is to solve problems in production, to implement the development of production, to implement democratic management and the policy of considering both public and private interests, and not just to sign contracts for the sake of signing contracts. Second, the signing of contracts should be taken as a powerful method of mobilizing employees. Therefore, the process of signing contracts must go through full democratic deliberation and discussion, and must never be monopolized by a few people at the upper levels. In individual enterprises, it has happened that only the completion of tasks by employees was emphasized, while the guarantees that the administration should provide were not specifically mentioned, or there was a bias in the rewards and punishments that overemphasized punishment. For example, the first collective contract of the Northeast People's Government Administration of the Kiln Industry General Factory failed because it did not care about the vital interests of the workers and the reward and punishment methods were not reasonable, which should be taken as a lesson. Third, the contract should be mature after deliberation. After the terms are properly revised, a formal and solemn signing ceremony must be held to ensure that both parties keep their promises. For example, the Chengzihe Sixth Pit in Jixi signed a collective contract in November, but because it was not formally signed, the workers were not enthusiastic and doubted whether the administration would implement it. After the formal signing on the 15th, the workers' morale immediately rose. Fourth, after the contract is signed, timely and regular inspections and continuous political mobilization must be carried out. At the end of the contract period, it must be summarized, and rewards and punishments must be implemented in accordance with regulations. The Shenyang Woolen Mill holds weekly joint meetings of trade union group leaders and workshop foremen to conduct inspections, which is very effective in promoting progress. Fifth, the signing of collective contracts must be approved by the higher-level administrative organs and the higher-level trade union, and should be filed with the labor bureau. Sixth, the signing of collective contracts or contact contracts must be carried out with a serious and responsible attitude. The parties signing the contract must keep their promises, and the trade union should conduct education on complying with the contract and striving to complete the tasks stipulated in the contract. Any violation of the contract should be appropriately criticized and struggled against so that the contract can be fully realized.

    东北总工会研讨公营企业经验
    决推广签订集体、联系合同
    签订集体合同应具备的主要条件是要有较切实的生产计划，比较充分地发动群众。签订集体合同或联系合同后，对发展生产，改进管理，推动工会面向生产作用很大。
    【本报讯】东北总工会于去年十二月二十二日召开座谈会，研讨公营企业中签订集体合同及联系合同问题。参加座谈者有大连、长春、抚顺、沈阳、阜新、安东等地曾经签订了合同的各国营公营企业工会干部二十余人。东北人民政府工业部也派员参加。会议作出如下总结：
    （一）签订集体合同或联系合同，无论在发展生产或推进创纪录运动上都起了显著作用。据不完全统计，各地已签订了集体合同的有旅大地区二十二个企业单位，沈阳第一、三、五、机器厂，吉林石砚造纸厂，长春市政企业煤气厂、自来水厂、电车厂，黑龙江绥棱制材厂、黑龙江碱厂等单位。已签订联系合同的有沈阳毛织厂、橡胶一厂、开国制车厂，安东造纸厂（十二月份亦订了集体合同）等。各地经验证明，签订集体合同或联系合同是进一步发动群众提高生产、改进管理的最好组织手段。沈阳毛织厂十一月份签订了联系合同，超过了生产任务百分之一点四四，打破了该厂半年来均未完成任务的情况，并保证了质量；石砚造纸厂在前三季亚硫酸纸浆碎木纸浆从未完成生产任务，十月份订了集体合同后便超过了任务。其他如第三机械厂、抚顺露天矿深部等，签订集体合同后，生产都出现了杰出的成绩。而且普遍的是经过签订集体合同与联系合同以后，厂长得以从手工业事务主义的工作方式中解脱出来，可以主动机动的去掌握重心，深入现场发现问题解决问题，去筹划布置和检查全盘的工作，并且推动了管理制度与管理人员工作的进步；工会干部也明确了自己独立的工作和业务，摸到了工会工作面向生产的具体道路。在追溯这些成绩的原因时，会议一致认为：这是由于签订集体合同与联系合同，进一步贯彻了管理民主化及公私兼顾的政策；密切了工种工序间的联系，加强了职工间的团结；使全体职工同心协力为一个共同目标——执行合同的规定而努力；改进了工会工作方法，使工会工作进一步与生产相结合，因而加强了工会与职工群众的联系，健全了组织并从而提高了职工群众对工会的认识。
    联系合同应针对各车间所存在的问题，相互保证产品的数量质量与时间。
    （二）联系合同是在群众发动及新纪录发展不平衡的情况之下，工厂管理制度还不健全的情况之下，为了紧密地组织各工种工序并使先进车间带动落后车间的契约，它是为保证生产任务之完成的组织手段。因此，联系合同应该针对着车间之间所存在的问题，相互保证产品的数量，质量与时间。现在联系合同有的发展到生产部门与行政管理部门订立联系合同；有些工厂，对签订联系合同后保证得好的车间给以荣誉奖（如各种红旗等），而安东造纸厂并规定了物质奖惩的办法，在签订了联系合同后超过了国家生产任务，并且保证得好的车间，由厂方给超额奖励，保证得不好者则扣除在超额奖金中的一部分，这些办法，会议认为可以推广。签订联系合同应由工会与行政研究后由工会去加以组织和领导，车间主任或工长及车间的工会负责人共同代表全体车间职工签字。安东造纸厂和沈阳毛织厂组织签订联系合同的经验较好。毛织厂是经党、政、工会干部研究讨论后，在职工群众中动员，并由工会组织各车间工人自己去拟定合同内容，工会组织审查与订正。安东造纸厂的联系合同则首先在重点车间——木釜间、抄纸间和几个有关的车间订立，而由他们依次与其他互有联系的车间去签订。由于联系合同是职工相互间的共同保证，因此它与集体合同还不同，它不可能表现出总的生产目标及完成生产任务所需要的各种保证条件，也不可能完全解决公私兼顾和规定行政与工会的权利和义务等问题；但因为适合于解决目前生产上相当普遍的脱节现象，因此，目前依然应该普遍推广。而且联系合同普遍推广后，也必然要向集体合同方向发展。
            根据不同具体条件
            签订不同具体合同
    （三）集体合同是工会代表全体职工与代表国家的企业行政方面之间为共同达成与超过生产任务，贯彻公私兼顾，分明职责而签订的合同，因此，应由工会与行政方面签订。有的工厂由工人与管委会间订立，是不妥当的。各地已有的集体合同约有下列几种形式：（１）旅大地区的企业因生产发展和企业管理各方面的条件均比较成熟，故集体合同内容较为完备，合同有效期限较长，一般为一年。（２）一般的生产定额工资制度还在变动的情况下，则应先订短期的集体合同，如沈阳第三机器厂，其内容还很不完备，有效时期较短——一个月或两个月。（３）一个车间或一个生产部门或一个坑与行政上单独签订的集体合同，如长春煤气厂制造部及锅炉部（开始第一个月从一个车间取得经验，第二个月即订了全厂集体合同），抚顺胜利矿岩石道口，鸡西小恒山一坑等。（４）带有包工性质适用于恢复工程的集体合同，如抚顺露天矿深部的集体合同。这几种情况说明了：集体合同内容可以有详有简，期限可以有长有短，范围可以有广有狭，但均需明确规定行政与工会双方的权利与义务。经验证明：不论那种形式，签订了集体合同的，都发动了群众，收到良好的成绩。签订集体合同是要一些条件的：如比较切实的生产计划，明确的奖励办法，比较充分发动群众等等，但最重要的条件，则是领导上对集体合同的作用的重视与否。根据目前情况签订集体合同的条件，在许多厂矿中是初步具备的，因此，各地应重视这些经验，积极着手试行。但必须注意：合同内容应视实际情况及准备的程度而定，能规定多少即规定多少，不能规定者暂不规定，期限一般不宜太长。合同内容也可以随着生产和创纪录运动之发展而逐渐充实或更加具体周密。据现有经验，集体合同内容一般地应该包括：生产任务，行政保证事项，工会领导全体职工保证事项，奖惩办法，调解委员会等项。签订了集体合同后，车间联系合同一般仍有必要，借以保证集体合同的执行。自上而下的产业系统的集体合同，应该成为各个公营企业管理局、公司与产业总工会共同努力的目标，争取其及早实现。
            领导上应该注意
    签订合同应充分发扬民主；贯彻民主管理，发展生产；并应定期检查严肃负责。
    最后，关于签订合同这一工作的领导问题。会议提出：第一，领导思想要明确签订合同是为了解决生产中的问题，要贯彻发展生产，贯彻管理民主化和公私兼顾的政策，绝不是为订合同而订合同。其次，应把订立合同，作为发动职工的有力方法，因此，在订立合同过程中要经过充分民主酝酿讨论，绝不可上层几个人包办。在个别企业中曾经发生过只强调职工完成任务而对行政方面应有的保证则提得不具体，或在奖惩中过多强调了处罚的偏差。如东北人民政府管理局窑业总厂第一次的集体合同由于没有关心到工人的切身利益，奖惩办法规定得不合理等，因而遭到失败，应引为借鉴。其三，合同酝酿成熟。条文修正妥当，必须履行正式与隆重的签字仪式，以资双方信守。比如鸡西城子河六坑，十一月份订了集体合同，因未正式签字，工人并不起劲，怀疑行政上是否执行，十五号正式签字后工人情绪马上高涨起来。其四，合同签订后，要进行及时的定期的检查，和不断的政治鼓动。合同期满必须进行总结，按规定执行奖惩。沈阳毛织厂每周召开工会组长车间工长联席会议进行检查，很有推动作用。其五，签订集体合同需经上级行政机关和上级工会批准，并应向劳动局备案。其六，签订集体合同或联系合同，必须贯彻严肃负责的态度，签订合同的双方必须信守不渝，工会应进行遵守合同与为完成合同所规定的任务而奋斗的教育。对于任何违犯合同的行为要进行适当的批评与斗争，以便使合同能全部实现。
