    To Implement Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit and Develop Production
    It Is Necessary to Widely Sign Collective Contracts
    Beijing's Experience Since October Proves This Is the Most Effective Method
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, in the ten months since leading various private industries to sign labor-capital collective contracts and inspecting the results of their implementation, has proven that: signing collective contracts in private enterprises is one of the most effective ways to implement the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital. In industries that have signed and correctly implemented labor-capital collective contracts, labor-capital relations have been brought onto the right track, and business and production have gradually recovered and developed. From July of last year to January of this year, the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau has formally approved six labor-capital collective contracts, including those for the local Chinese medicine, construction, night soil, weaving and dyeing, mechanized flour milling, and Mentougou and Chengzi small coal mine industries. The signing of each collective contract was the result of repeated deliberation, discussion, debate, and negotiation between labor and capital to reach consensus.
    Negotiation Steps
    Before a collective contract is signed in an industry, labor and capital separately solicit opinions from their respective members, discuss repeatedly, and draft their own proposals for the collective contract. Then, they exchange proposals through the Labor Bureau. At the same time, both sides select an equal number of representatives, and the Labor Bureau convenes the representatives of both sides for the first negotiation. At the negotiation meeting, both sides first elect one chairman each, one recorder, and one or two principal speakers from among their representatives, so that both sides can speak systematically and in a planned manner to avoid confusion of arguments. At the first meeting, the representatives of both sides put forward different or critical opinions on each other's proposals, and then the other party states the reasons for its proposals and makes a brief reply, after which the meeting can be adjourned. The representatives of both sides go back to convene general meetings to solicit opinions, and then conduct second and third negotiations until a complete agreement is reached. During the negotiation process, if there are problems that are difficult to solve, the Labor Bureau promptly invites relevant departments to study them, or convenes the labor or capital side separately for persuasion and education. If the dispute is still unresolved and no new opinions are put forward, it can be temporarily reserved, and resolved at the final negotiation, or formally submitted to the Labor Bureau for instructions.
    Focus of Dispute
    In the process of negotiation between labor and capital, the focus of dispute over the content of the contract is concentrated on wages, dismissal, and labor insurance benefits. First, wages: it is best not to stipulate the highest wage amount, but to stipulate the minimum wage and the general wage. For example, the construction, weaving and dyeing, mechanized flour milling, and small coal mine industries have all adopted this method. In this way, workers' wages can be free from the restriction of the highest wage due to different specific conditions such as technology and labor intensity, and the minimum living standard of workers can be guaranteed. The contract of the mechanized flour milling industry also stipulates that: "The wages of temporary workers should be higher than the wages of long-term workers of equal skill." The construction industry specifically stipulates the wages of long-term large and small workers, generally taking 80% of the wages of temporary large and small workers as the standard. This can avoid the capital side thinking that temporary workers are more cost-effective and refusing to use long-term workers. Second, the issue of dismissal: this is an issue that both labor and capital pay attention to. In the process of negotiation, the capital side opposed the method proposed by the labor side that: dismissal due to negligence should be "notified to the person and the trade union five days in advance," and stated: "Let us control this right of dismissal, and it will be easier to command the workers, we do not necessarily use it." After negotiation and persuasion and education by the Labor Bureau, most of the capital side realized that: the labor side's proposal to have the right to protest against unreasonable dismissal is to prevent the behavior of a few capital sides from dismissing workers on the pretext of grudges or because employees participate in trade unions and other political activities, which is necessary in the current situation and is beneficial to the restoration and development of production. Regarding the issue of dismissal compensation, each contract stipulates one to three months of actual wages. Third, vacation issue: In the above six contracts, annual and holiday vacations are stipulated according to the principle of "follow the government's regulations if there are any, and follow the custom if there are none." However, if there are special circumstances, it can be handled flexibly, such as the labor side of the mechanized flour milling industry initially requested "collective rest" to participate in cultural and political activities together. After the capital side stated the reasons, both parties agreed to "divide the workers into two shifts, one shift will rest every week" to avoid affecting production. In the contract, the worker's sick leave is generally stipulated as 30 days each year. Fourth, labor insurance and welfare issues: Compensation for injuries and deaths is more serious in the construction and small coal mine industries, so the dispute between labor and capital was the most when signing the contract. In order to avoid the capital side pushing the responsibility for death to the labor side itself on the pretext, after many debates and negotiations between labor and capital in the construction industry, it was finally stipulated that: "In the event of death due to work, a funeral pension equal to three and a half months to one year's salary will be temporarily issued, and the specific amount shall be agreed upon by the trade union and the capital side according to the specific circumstances." The small coal mine industry stipulates that "If an employee dies due to work, the capital side will issue ordinary clothes and coffins, and the minimum pension will be 5,000 catties of millet." The positive significance of these regulations is to strengthen the capital side's sense of responsibility for the death of employees due to work, and to urge it to improve the safety equipment of the project and avoid the occurrence of unfortunate events. As for welfare matters, in each contract, it is generally stipulated as "maintaining the status quo" and "improving the situation if it is not good," because under the current general production situation, the working environment can only be gradually improved under the existing conditions, and only after production is restored and developed can the welfare problem be properly solved.
    Several Experiences
    (1) The signing of a collective contract is a process of organizing and educating workers; it is also a process of educating the capital side, opening up their minds, and helping them understand policies. In the rational struggle between labor and capital, on the one hand, the class consciousness of the workers has been improved, and on the other hand, the capitalists have a further understanding of the working class, and labor-capital relations can be gradually improved.
    (2) Long-winded, lengthy, and unrealistic contracts are not needed by both labor and capital; while short, concise, and simple collective contracts are welcomed by both labor and capital. For example, the collective contract of the night soil industry has few clauses, but it solves many important practical problems.
    (3) The representatives of labor and capital who negotiate the collective contract must include large, medium, and small factories and shops, so that they can fully represent both parties, so as to avoid the specific situations of large, medium, and small factories and shops being different and unable to represent each other, which affects the implementation of the contract. For example, when the weaving and dyeing industry negotiated the collective contract, there were more managers of medium and large factories among the capital representatives. After the wage issue was agreed upon for the first time, it could not be passed by all members. In industries with large differences in business scope, after signing a collective contract, it is also necessary to sign separate contracts or individual contracts according to the different specific situations of each company.
    (4) If there are problems that cannot be agreed upon in the negotiation between labor and capital, other problems can be negotiated separately, and the problems that have been solved can be signed into a temporary agreement first. For example, the labor-capital problems in the construction industry could not be completely solved at first, so a temporary wage agreement was signed first, and then after further understanding of the situation and negotiation, the signing of the collective contract was finally achieved; the signing of three temporary agreements in the bathhouse industry played a great role.
    (5) The Labor Bureau must be cautious in approving the contract; it must take into account the impact of this contract on other industries. At the same time as approving and publishing a contract, the advantages and disadvantages of the contract should be commented on, and the reasons should be explained. The words and sentences in the clauses are also very important. For example, in the initial draft contract of the Chinese medicine industry, there were harsh words such as "immediate dismissal," which have been appropriately corrected.

    贯彻劳资两利发展生产
    必须广泛签订集体合同
    京市十月来经验证明是最有效的方式
    【北京讯】北京市人民政府劳动局，在十个月以来，领导各私营行业签订劳资集体合同，并检查其执行的结果，证明：私营企业中订立集体合同，是贯彻发展生产劳资两利政策的最有效的方式之一。凡是订立并正确执行了劳资集体合同的行业，劳资关系都因而走向正轨，营业、生产逐渐地得到恢复与发展。去年七月到今年一月，经京市劳动局正式批准的劳资集体合同计有本市国药、建筑、粪业、织染、机制面粉和门头沟、城子小窑业等六个劳资集体合同。每个集体合同的签订，都是经过劳资双方多次酝酿、讨论、争执和协商而取得一致的。
    协商的步骤
    在一个行业订立集体合同之前，劳资双方即分别在自己的会员中，征求意见，经过反复讨论，拟出自己对集体合同的提案。然后，再通过劳动局互相交换提案。同时双方各自选出同等数目的代表，由劳动局召集双方代表进行第一次协商。协商会上，先由双方从代表中各选主席一人，记录一人及主要发言人一、二人，以便双方有系统地、有计划地统一发言，免使论点混淆。第一次会议，由双方代表互向对方的提案提出不同或批判的意见，再由对方申述其提案理由并作简短答辩之后，即可休会。双方代表回去各自召集大会，征求意见，再进行第二、第三次协商，直至达到全部协议为止。在协商过程中，遇有难以解决的问题，劳动局就及时邀请各有关部门研究，或召集劳方或资方单独进行说服教育。如仍争执不决，又无新的意见提出时，可暂行保留，等到最后协商解决，或正式呈请劳动局批示。
    争执的焦点
    劳资双方在协商的过程中，对合同内容的争执焦点是集中在工资、解雇和劳动保险福利等问题上。第一、工资问题：最好不规定最高的工资数额，可以规定最低工资和一般工资。例如建筑、织染、机器面粉、小窑等业都采取了这种办法。这样，可以使工人工资因技术、劳动强度等等具体条件不同而不受最高工资的限制，并保障工人最低的生活水平。在机制面粉业合同中并规定了：“临时工工资应高于同等技能长工之工资”。建筑业更具体规定了长期大小工工资，一般以临时大小工工资十分之八为标准。这样可以避免资方认为临时工比较合算而拒用长工。第二、解雇问题：这是劳资双方所一致注目的问题。在协商过程中，资方都反对劳方所提：因过失解雇应于“五日前通知本人及工会”的办法，并表示：“让我们掌握这个解雇权，就容易指挥工人了，我们并不一定使用。”经过协商和劳动局的说服教育后，多数资方都认识到：劳方提出对不合理的解雇有抗议权，是防止少数资方挟嫌或因职工参加工会及其他政治活动而借故解雇工人的行为，这在目前情况下是必要的，对恢复与发展生产是有利的。关于解雇金问题，每个合同中都规定一个月到三个月的实际工资。第三、假期问题：在上述六个合同中，年节假期都按“政府有规定者依规定，无规定者依习惯”的原则加以规定。但如有特殊情形的可酌量变通办理，如机制面粉业的劳方起初要求“集体休息”，以便共同参加文化政治活动，经资方声述理由后，双方协议“把工人分为两班，每周有一班休息”，以免影响生产。每年工人的病假，在合同中一般地都规定了三十天。第四、劳动保险福利问题：伤亡抚恤在建筑和小窑业中比较严重，因而在签订合同时，劳资双方的争执也最多。为避免资方借故把死亡责任推到劳方本人身上，建筑业劳资双方经多次争论协商，最后规定为：“因公致死者，暂定发给等于三个半月至一年工资的丧葬抚恤金，具体数目由工会与资方根据具体情况协议规定之”。小窑业则规定“职工因公致死者，由资方发给普通衣棺，抚恤金最低小米五千斤”。这些规定的积极意义，是在加强资方对职工因公致死的责任心，促其改进工程的安全设备，避免不幸事件的发生。至于福利事项，在各个合同中，一般都规定为“维持现状”，以及“情形不佳者，予以改善”，因为以目前一般的生产情况，只能在现有条件下，使工作环境逐渐改善，只有生产得到恢复与发展后，福利问题才能获当适当的解决。
    几点经验
    （一）订立集体合同是组织及教育工人的过程；同时也是教育资方打通思想，帮助他们了解政策的过程。在劳资双方的说理斗争中，一方面提高了工人的阶级觉悟，另一方面也使资本家对工人阶级有了进一步的认识，劳资关系才有可能得到逐步改善。
    （二）长篇大论、条文冗长、不切合实际的合同，劳资双方都不感需要；而短小精悍、简单扼要的集体合同，则为劳资双方所欢迎。如粪业的集体合同，条文虽少，却解决了许多重要的实际问题。
    （三）劳资双方协商集体合同的代表，一定要包罗大、中、小各厂号，使能充分代表双方，以免因大、中、小厂号的具体情形不同，而不能互相代表，影响合同的执行。如织染业协商集体合同时资方代表中、大厂经理较多，工资问题第一次获得协议之后，却不能在全体会员中通过。在经营范围大小悬殊的行业中，订立了集体合同之后，再按各家不同的具体情况订立分合同或单独合同，也很必要。
    （四）在劳资双方协商中如遇不能得到协议的问题，可以另行协商其他问题，将已经解决的问题，先订成一个临时协议。如建筑业的劳资问题，最初不可能全部求得解决，就先订了一个工资临时协议，再经过进一步了解情况与协商，终于达到集体合同的订立；浴堂业订了三条临时协议，就起了很大的作用。
    （五）劳动局对合同的批准，必须慎重进行；要照顾到这一合同对于其他行业的影响。在批准公布一个合同的同时，对合同中的优缺点，应加以评论，并说明其原因。条文中的词句也很重要，如国药业在最初的合同草案中；有“立即解雇”等生硬的字样，都已加以适当的改正。
