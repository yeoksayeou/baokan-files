Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th. The United States' active measures to support the Japanese textile industry have aroused dissatisfaction and fear among British textile factory owners. According to a Dentsu News Agency report from London: British textile factory owners intend to request the British government to take necessary steps regarding the US aid to Japan. British textile factories are extremely fearful of the news that "the United States has already shipped new textile machinery to Japan," because "this will greatly save production costs for the Japanese textile industry and help Japan drive British competitors out of the world market." Furthermore, according to an Agence France-Presse report from Manchester: The Manchester Chamber of Commerce, the center of the British textile industry, received a report on the 3rd stating that Japan is beginning to fiercely compete with Britain in the textile markets of the East and colonies. A report from the China and Far East Department of the Chamber of Commerce complained that the British government has so far failed to recognize this threat. The report stated: "The Japanese estimate that they will export 800 million yards of cloth this year, about one-third of the pre-war figure. However, we must remember that Japan has lost its imperial market, and as a result, its efforts have to be concentrated on British colonies and those Far Eastern markets that were extremely important to Britain in the past."

    美扶助日纺织业
    英纺织界甚恐惧
    【新华社北京七日电】美国积极扶助日本纺织业的措置，已引起英国纺织工厂业主的不满和恐惧。据电通社伦敦消息：英国纺织工厂业主对美国扶日的措施，打算请求英国政府采取必要的步骤。英国纺织工厂对“美国业已将新的纺织机器运到日本”的消息，异常恐惧，因为“这将使日本纺织业大大地节省生产成本，并有助于日本将英国竞争者驱逐于世界市场之外”。又据法新社曼彻斯特消息：英国纺织工业的中心曼彻斯特的商会于三日接得报告称：日本正在东方及殖民地的纺织品市场上，开始与英国进行猛烈的竞争。该商会中国和远东部执行处的一项报告，抱怨英国政府迄未能认识这种威胁。该报告称：“日本人估计，今年将有八万万码布匹输出，约为战前数字的三分之一。但是，我们必须记着，日本已丧失了它的帝国市场，其结果，它的努力只得集中于英国殖民地和那些过去对英国极为重要的远东市场。”
