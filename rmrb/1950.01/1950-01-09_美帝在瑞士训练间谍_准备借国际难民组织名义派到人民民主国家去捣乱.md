Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 8th: TASS, Prague, January 6th, citing a Telepress Geneva dispatch, states: Four hundred American students residing in Geneva are currently undergoing training in preparation for participating in the work of the American spy network operating in the People's Democratic countries. The expenses for this large group of students in Geneva are being borne by the US Department of Defense.

Even during the Second World War, Switzerland was the center of the American spy system operating in Europe, led by Allen Dulles (brother of the American monopoly capitalist representative, Foster Dulles). After Germany's defeat, many former German agents were recruited by the United States to serve American imperialism. In light of the testimony of one of them—Gibert, who had worked with the German spy organization "Defense Guard" during the war and later served as an American spy—the Swiss government had to request Washington to recall the American Assistant Military Attaché and other officials of the American mission in Bern.

American spies are being dispatched to People's Democratic countries with the assistance of the headquarters of the International Refugee Organization in Geneva. This International Refugee Organization is a network of spy agencies, whose personnel are adept at establishing contacts with enemies of the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union.

    美帝在瑞士训练间谍
    准备借国际难民组织名义派到人民民主国家去捣乱
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社布拉格六日电引电通社日内瓦消息称：住在日内瓦的四百个美国学生，现在正在接受训练，以备参加在人民民主国家活动的美国间谍网的工作。这一大批学生在日内瓦的费用，由美国国防机关负担。
    远在第二次世界大战时，瑞士即是在欧洲活动的而受艾伦·杜勒斯（美国垄断资本家代理人福斯特·杜勒斯的兄弟）领导的美国间谍系统的中心。德国战败之后，许多以前的德国特务便被美国罗致，为美国帝国主义服务。瑞士政府鉴于他们里边的一个人——战时和德国间谍组织“保卫队”在一起工作、以后又充任美国间谍的吉伯尔——的证言，不得不请求华盛顿召回美国助理武官及美国驻伯尔尼使团的其他一些官员。
    美国间谍借设在日内瓦的国际难民组织总部之助而被遣送到人民民主国家中去。这个国际难民组织是星罗棋布的间谍机关，它的负责人员长于和人民民主国家与苏联的敌人建立联系。
