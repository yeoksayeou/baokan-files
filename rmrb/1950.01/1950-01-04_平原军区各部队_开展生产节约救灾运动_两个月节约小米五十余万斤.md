The PLA in the Pingyuan Military Region Launches a Production, Thrift, and Disaster Relief Campaign
Two Months of Savings Amount to More Than 500,000 Jin of Millet

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since its establishment, the Pingyuan Military Region has, with a long-term perspective, been conducting planned and focused construction work based on the principles of thrift and self-reliance. In particular, under the leading influence of the Military Region's political and administrative organs, a surge of production and construction has unfolded throughout the region. According to incomplete statistics, from September 20th, the date of the Military Region's establishment, to November 30th of last year, a total of 60,615 workdays were spent on production and construction, digging 602,256 bricks, repairing 1,912 rooms, building 186 rooms, moving 812,832 bricks, building 566 zhang of walls, making 49,143 brick blanks, and building 603 kang beds. In terms of agricultural production, 346 mu of wheat were planted, 286,250 jin of grass were cut, and 59 mu of vegetables were planted. Calculated at the November rate in Xinxiang of 6 jin of millet per day for a small laborer (10 jin for a large laborer), 60,615 workdays are equivalent to 363,690 jin of millet. Calculated at the Xinxiang rate of 5 bricks per jin of millet, 602,256 bricks are equivalent to 120,451 jin of millet. These two items alone saved the state 484,141 jin of millet.

The main experiences from this production and construction are: First, it is necessary to conduct ideological education on long-term planning. The transition from a long-term war environment to a peaceful construction environment is a significant one. However, some comrades still do not have a clear understanding of this transition. For example, some say, "Soldiers go and live wherever they are; what is there to build?" Therefore, it is necessary to patiently conduct persuasive education. Once the ideology is clear, they can automatically and actively participate in production and construction work.

Second, launching a meritorious service campaign in production and construction is an important aspect of promoting production and construction. When the Military Region's political and administrative organs were digging bricks, moving bricks, and building the auditorium, they called on everyone to perform meritorious service. In response to the call, every comrade competed to participate in labor.

Third, the personal involvement of leaders at all levels has played a promoting role. Responsible comrades from the Military Region and sub-districts conscientiously planned, supervised, inspected, and personally participated. In particular, Commander Liu Zhiyuan of the Military Region took the lead in moving bricks, which greatly promoted production and construction throughout the Military Region.

Currently, in order to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's "Instructions on the Army's Participation in Production and Construction in 1950," the Military Region plans to universally and deeply conduct education on "Labor is Glorious" and "Establishing Revolutionary Housekeeping" in the troops, and to actively prepare organizationally and materially, continue to complete the current production and construction plan, and on this basis, move towards the large-scale production movement of the entire Military Region's troops this year.

[Another News Item] Since the Pingyuan Military Region issued instructions on September 26th of last year in response to the North China Military Region's call for thrift and disaster relief, an anti-corruption, anti-waste, thrift, and disaster relief campaign has been widely launched in the troops. This campaign has now entered a more in-depth stage. According to incomplete statistics, from October 1st (the military directly started on September 20th) to November 30th, saving one liang of millet per person per day, the entire region saved a total of 111,714 jin; office miscellaneous expenses for only seven units reached 425,383 yuan in Renminbi. In addition, there were 323 pairs of shoes, 107 single garments, and 83 towels. Individual donations from units directly under the Military Region, the Military and Political Cadre School, and the Puyang Sub-district amounted to 552,926 yuan in Renminbi.

In the thrift and disaster relief campaign, most units have managed to both save money and improve their living standards. A few units have maintained normal living standards, and only individual units have experienced a reduction in living standards due to thrift. The main experiences are:

(1) In-depth education to inspire consciousness. After thrift and disaster relief were proposed, some people initially resisted ideologically. However, after various meetings, mobilization discussions, promoting the glorious tradition of hard struggle of the People's Liberation Army, and understanding the living conditions of disaster victims, everyone believed that they should be thrifty, thus entering a challenge competition, and also formulating plans to ensure thrift and improve living standards.

(2) Oppose corruption and waste, and strictly manage the economy. At the beginning of the thrift campaign, a general inspection was carried out, and many instances of waste were discovered. For example, the Anyang Sub-district previously spent money to hire livestock to grind flour, exchanged white flour for noodles, and did not eat leftovers, with one company wasting more than 100 jin of grain a month. In many units in the Xinxiang Sub-district, cadres borrowed food money, which affected their lives. The Economic Committee's work was unsound, and some responsible cadres did not inquire about food. After the inspection, many specific measures were formulated, especially establishing and improving the work of the Economic Committee, which improved living standards.

(3) Organize sideline production. All units universally make tofu, sprout beans, and raise pigs. Some units have also carried out land reclamation, vegetable planting, grass cutting, firewood gathering, etc., which reduces food costs and allows them to eat well. This is one of the most effective and guaranteed ways to improve living standards.

(4) Unified purchase of oil, salt, and other goods. With sub-districts, brigades, or large regiments as units, funds are concentrated, and goods are purchased in batches by the supply organs, which is much cheaper than purchasing them locally at retail.

(5) Thrift dividend system. For example, the Anyang Sub-district stipulates that one jin of coal per person per day is the standard, and then implements a thrift dividend system according to the standard. Now, on average, only twelve liang of coal per person per day is enough. Cooks automatically clean the boiler and burn the coal slag, sifting it and mixing it with new coal to burn, which not only ensures cooking but also ensures a constant supply of boiling water.

(6) Personal involvement and supervision by leaders at all levels is an important aspect of thrift and improving living standards.

    平原军区各部队
    开展生产节约救灾运动
    两个月节约小米五十余万斤
    【本报讯】平原军区成立以来，为了长期打算，曾在节约与自己动手的原则下，进行了有计划有重点的建设工作。尤其在军区司政机关带头影响下，在全区展开了生产建设的热潮。据不完全统计，自去年九月二十日军区成立到十一月三十日止，为生产建设支出劳力共六○、六一五个工，挖砖六○二、二五六块，修房子一、九一二间，盖房子一八六间，搬砖八一二、八三二块，打墙五六六丈，托砖坯四九、一四三块，垒炕六○三个。在农业生产方面，种麦三四六亩，割草二八六、二五○斤，种菜五九亩。以十一月份新乡雇工每天小工六斤小米（大工十斤小米）价格计算，共六○、六一五工，合小米三六三、六九○斤。以新乡每斤小米买五块砖价格计算，六○二、二五六块砖合小米一二○、四五一斤，仅此两项即可为国家节约小米四八四、一四一斤。
    在这次生产建设中的几点主要体会。一、必须进行长期打算的思想教育，由长期的战争环境转变为和平建设环境，这是一个极大的转变。但有些同志对这一转变还认识不清，如有的说：“当兵的走到那里住到那里，还建设什么？”因此必须耐心的进行说服教育，只要思想上弄通了，即能自动的积极参加生产建设工作。
    二、开展生产建设中的立功运动，是推动生产建设的重要一环。军区司政机关挖砖、搬砖、修建大礼堂时号召大家立功。为响应号召，每个同志都争先参加劳动。
    三、各级首长亲自动手，起了推动作用。军区、分区负责同志都认真的计划督促检查与亲自动手。特别是军区刘致远司令员带头搬砖，对全军区生产建设推动作用很大。
    目前该军区为彻底执行毛主席“关于一九五○年军队参加生产建设的指示”，拟在部队中普遍深入地进行“劳动光荣”“建立革命家务”的教育，及积极的从组织上物质上准备，继续完成目前生产建设计划，并在这一基础上转向今年全军区部队的大生产运动。（谢良）
    【又讯】自去年九月二十六日平原军区发出为响应华北军区节约救灾号召的指示后，即在部队中普遍展开了反贪污浪费节约救灾运动，现这一运动已进入较深入的阶段。据不完全的统计，自十月一日（军直是九月二十日开始）至十一月三十日止，每人每天节约一两小米，全区共计节约十一万一千七百十四斤；办公杂支只七个单位的统计即达人民币四十二万五千三百八十三元。此外还有鞋子三二三双，单衣一○七件，毛巾八三条，军区各直属单位、军政干校、濮阳分区等个人捐助人民币五十五万二千九百二十六元。
    在节约救灾运动中，大部分单位作到了既节约而生活又能得到改善，少数单位生活保持正常，只有个别单位，因节约生活降低。主要经验是：
    （一）深入教育，启发自觉。自节约救灾提出后，开始有些人思想上对抗，但在各种会议，动员讨论，发扬人民解放军艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，和了解灾民的生活的情况后，大家即认为应该节约，由此进入挑战比赛，而且订出计划保证节约，还要作到改善生活。
    （二）反对贪污浪费，严格经济管理。在节约开始时普遍的进行了检查，发现很多浪费现象，如安阳分区以前花钱雇牲口磨面，用白面换面条，不吃剩饭，一个连一个月就要浪费百余斤粮食。新乡分区很多单位，干部借伙食钱，影响生活，经委会工作不健全，有些负责干部不过问伙食。经检查后，订出很多具体办法，特别建立与健全了经委会工作，这样生活就改善了。
    （三）组织副业生产。各单位普遍的做豆腐，生豆芽，喂猪，有些单位又进行了开荒种菜、割草、打柴等，这样就使伙食花钱少，吃得好，这是改善生活最有效和最有保证的方法之一。
    （四）统购油盐物品，以分区、旅或大团为单位，集中经费，由供给机关统一整批的购买物品，比在当地零购要便宜得多。
    （五）节约分红制。如安阳分区规定烧煤每人每天一斤为标准，然后按标准实行节约分红，现平均每人每天只烧十二两煤就够了，炊事员自动的盘锅炉，烧过煤渣，筛过再拌上新煤烧，既保证了做饭，还保证了经常有开水喝。
    （六）各级首长亲自动手，督促检查，这是节约和改善生活的重要环节。
                                                        （谢良）
