Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: A Warsaw dispatch from the Polish News Agency: "Armed Poland" pointed out that the characteristic of Acheson's recent statement on China is "slanderous lies, which prove the imperialists' fury at their failure in China." The newspaper also said that this statement also attempts to sow discord between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. However, Vyshinsky's reply exposed Acheson's treachery and struck a blow to this provocation by the U.S. State Department. China has given another blow to American slander. The traditional friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is permanent and indestructible. No slander or provocation from Acheson's side can change it.
    The Chinese people know who their enemies are and have proven that they know how to strike at these enemies. The Chinese people also know who China's friends are and have proven that they know how to love these friends.

    中苏人民传统友谊是永远不可破坏的
    《武装的波兰》报痛斥艾奇逊声明
    【新华社北京二十六日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：《武装的波兰》报指出艾奇逊最近对华声明的特点，为“诽谤性的谎语，它证明了帝国主义者对他们在中国失败的狂怒”。该报又说，这个声明也企图在中苏两大民族间挑拨离间。可是维辛斯基的答复揭露了艾奇逊的奸诈，打击了美国国务院的这个挑拨。中国又给了美国的诽谤以另一个打击。中苏人民间的传统友谊，是永久而不可破坏的。艾奇逊方面的任何诽谤和挑拨都不能加以改变。
    中国人民知道谁是他们的敌人，并证明了他们知道如何来打击这些敌人。中国人民也知道谁是中国的友人，并证明了他们知道如何来爱这些友人。
