Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 31st: Generals Liu Bocheng (Commander), Deng Xiaoping (Political Commissar), Zhang Jichun (Deputy Political Commissar and Director of the Political Department), and Li Da (Chief of Staff) of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, along with all the officers and soldiers of the Second Field Army, sent a telegram to the Party, government, army, and people of major administrative regions, thanking them for their support to the Second Field Army. The telegram reads as follows:

To the comrades of the Party, government, and people of the North China Bureau, East China Bureau, Central China Bureau, and Northwest Bureau of the CPC, forwarded to all the comrades of the First, Third, and Fourth Field Armies!

Following the liberation of Chongqing and Guiyang, the Kuomintang troops in Yunnan and Sichuan-Xikang successively announced their uprising under the nationwide victory and the powerful offensive of our army, breaking away from the Kuomintang reactionary camp and turning to the side of the people. The Hu Zongnan troops, who had retreated from Shaanxi and Gansu and gathered around Chengdu, also either announced their uprising, laid down their arms, or were quickly annihilated in the joint offensive of our First, Fourth, and Second Field Armies. By December 27th, the entire army had been wiped out. By this point, the entire Southwest, except for He Guoguang's troops in Xichang and Li Mi and Yu Chengwan's troops in southern Yunnan who are still temporarily lingering in a corner, has been completely liberated. On the occasion of the 70 million people in the Southwest celebrating their liberation, we extend our sincere gratitude and fraternal greetings to you.

Our Second Field Army is a force that grew up in North China. For many years, it has been gradually strengthened under the nurture of the Party, government, and people of North China. The sons and daughters of the people of North China have always been the backbone and core of this army. We deeply feel that we have not disgraced the glorious title of the people's soldiers of North China. This is not only due to the completion of our tasks under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, but also because the people of North China have given us constant support, supervision, and encouragement. Therefore, we should extend our sincere gratitude and fraternal greetings to the comrades in North China, especially in the former Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan area.

From the first day of the Liberation War, we have been fighting closely and harmoniously alongside our brothers in the Third Field Army, and have been fighting alongside the people of East China in the East China region since the Huaihai Campaign. During this period, the Party, government, people, and brothers of the Third Field Army in the East China region gave us enthusiastic help and encouragement, often exceeding the standards of the Third Field Army and the possibilities of finance in terms of treatment. When we were preparing to advance into the Southwest, with your help, we did not feel the slightest material difficulty, and the replenishment of soldiers and cadres further strengthened our confidence in advancing into the Southwest. Even now, we are still reducing many difficulties with your financial assistance. Therefore, we should extend our sincere gratitude and fraternal greetings to the comrades in the East China region and the Third Field Army.

In our march to the Southwest, we almost passed through the entire area of Central China. Under the cordial reception of our brothers in the Fourth Field Army and the Party, government, and people of Central China, we did not encounter any difficulties. The thoroughness of the support-the-front work of the Party and government organs, the welcome and encouragement of the people along the way, and the humble attitude, loving spirit, and exemplary discipline of the brother troops of the Fourth Field Army deeply moved each of us. We know that the Fourth Field Army is very hard, but it treated the Second Field Army with more than possible generosity. This also made us feel a little uneasy. In the entire Southwest campaign, the cooperation between the two field armies was also very good. The Fourth Corps of the Second Field Army, under the exemplary command of Comrade Lin Biao, achieved new victories and new training. The 47th, 50th, and 42nd Armies, the 1st and 2nd Independent Divisions of Hubei, and the engineering units of the Fourth Field Army showed an exemplary spirit of hard work, heroic struggle, and discipline in their coordinated operations in entering Sichuan and Guizhou. Therefore, we should extend our sincere thanks and fraternal greetings to the comrades in the Central China region and the Fourth Field Army. We extend our condolences and gratitude to the officers and soldiers of the Fourth Field Army who fought in Sichuan!

One of the main reasons why the Southwest Campaign could be completed so quickly, especially why the main force of the enemy in the Southwest, the Hu Zongnan troops, could be annihilated so quickly, was the rapid advance of the 18th Corps of the First Field Army under the leadership of Comrade He Long. This time, the Party, government, people, and brothers of the First Field Army in the Northwest made great efforts in assisting the liberation of the Southwest and in the assistance of cadres. Therefore, we should extend our sincere gratitude and fraternal greetings to the comrades in the Northwest region and the First Field Army. We extend our warm congratulations to the comrades of the 18th Corps.

Dear comrades! The situation in the Southwest has opened up, but on the road of continued victory, we still have many difficulties. We should humbly learn from the experience of the advanced regions of the country to consolidate and develop our victory!

Comrades! Under the banner of Chairman Mao, let us work together!

We wish you good health in the New Year!
         Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Zhang Jichun, Li Da and all comrades of the Second Field Army bow
                                     January 1, 1950

    刘伯承邓小平诸将军率二野全体指战员
    致电各大行政区感谢支援
    在各区党政军民热诚支援与配合下，二野顺利进军西南，并迅速获得胜利，整个西南已基本解放；值此七千万人民欢庆解放之际，特致诚挚的感谢和兄弟的敬礼！
    【新华社重庆三十一日电】人民解放军第二野战军司令员刘伯承、政治委员邓小平、副政治委员兼政治部主任张际春、参谋长李达率第二野战军全体指战员，致电各大行政区党政军民，感谢他们对第二野战军的支援。电文如下：
    中共中央华北局、华东局、华中局、西北局转全区党政民同志们！一野、三野、四野全体指战员同志们！
    继重庆、贵阳解放之后，云南、川康国民党军在全国胜利和我军强大攻势下，相继宣布起义，脱离国民党反动营垒，转到人民方面来。由陕甘退集于成都周围的胡宗南部，也在我一野、四野和二野三大兄弟部队联合进攻下，或宣布起义，或放下武器，或迅速遭到歼灭，截至十二月二十七日已告全军覆灭。至此，整个西南，除西昌贺国光部及滇南李弥、余程万部还在暂时徘徊一隅之外，业已全部获得解放。值此西南七千万人民欢庆解放之际，我们特向你们致诚挚的感谢和兄弟的敬礼。
    我们二野是在华北生长起来的一支队伍，多年以来，一直是在华北党、政府和人民的抚育下而逐步壮大坚强起来的。华北人民的子弟一直是这个部队的骨干和核心。我们深感自己没有辱没华北人民子弟兵的光荣的称号。这除了由于在毛主席、朱总司令的英明领导下完成任务之外，同时，也由于华北人民给了我们以经常的支持、督促和鼓励。因此，我们应该向华北尤其是原晋冀鲁豫区的同志们致诚挚的感谢和兄弟的敬礼。
    我们从解放战争第一天起，就同三野兄弟们一直亲密和谐地并肩战斗着，从淮海战役起就在华东区同华东人民一块奋斗着。在此期间，华东区的党、政府、人民和三野兄弟们，给了我们以热情的帮助和鼓舞，在待遇上往往超过三野的标准和财政的可能。当我们准备向西南进军的时候，在你们的帮助下，我们没有感到丝毫物质的困难，而在兵员和干部的补充上，更使我们增强了进军西南的信心。一直到现在，我们还在你们的财政援助下，减少了不少的困难。因此，我们应该向华东区和三野的同志们致诚挚的感谢和兄弟的敬礼。
    我们在向西南的进军中，几乎通过了华中的全部地区，在四野兄弟们和华中党、政和人民的殷勤招待下，使我们没有遇到任何的困难。党政机关支前工作的周到，沿途人民的欢迎和鼓励，四野兄弟部队的谦逊的态度、友爱的精神和模范的纪律，都深深地感动了我们每一个人。我们知道四野部队很苦，而对二野部队则超过了可能的宽待。这也使我们感到一些不安。而在整个西南进军中，两个野战军的配合作战也是很好的。二野四兵团在林彪同志的模范指挥下，获得了新的胜利和新的锻炼。四野的四七军、五十军、四二军、鄂独一、二师及工兵部队，在协同入川入黔的作战中，表现了吃苦耐劳、英勇奋斗和守纪律的模范。因此，我们应该向华中区和四野的同志们致诚挚的谢意和兄弟的敬礼。向四野入川作战部队的指战员同志们致慰问与感谢之忱！
    西南战役之能如此迅速地完成，尤其是西南敌人主力胡宗南部能如此迅速地被歼灭，其主要原因之一，是一野十八兵团在贺龙同志率领下前进的神速。此次西北党、政、人民和一野兄弟们在协助西南解放和干部的援助上，尽了极大的努力。因此，我们应该向西北区及一野的同志们致诚挚的感谢和兄弟的敬礼。向十八兵团同志们致热烈的祝贺。
    亲爱的同志们！西南局面打开了，但是在继续胜利的前进道路上，我们的困难还很多，我们应当虚心地学习全国先进区的经验，来巩固和发展我们的胜利！
    同志们！在毛主席的旗帜下，共同努力吧！
    敬祝你们新年健康！
         刘伯承、邓小平、张际春、李达率第二野战军全体同志叩
                                     一九五零年元旦日
