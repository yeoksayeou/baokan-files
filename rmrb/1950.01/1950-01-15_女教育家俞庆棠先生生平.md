Biography of Female Educator Ms. Yu Qingtang
		Hu Naiqiu
I never imagined that Ms. Yu Qingtang, having just stood on the new China's people's education post, and was preparing to devote her talent and hard work in a free and vigorous environment, to work wholeheartedly for the "laboring masses" that she had always been thinking about, when she suddenly fell!

In the past two decades, some educators in our country, for the sake of mass education, have braved thorns and thistles and struggled arduously. These people had many ideals in the past that could not be realized; today, our mass education, under the leadership of the great Mao Zedong Thought, is able to rapidly progress towards a bright and broad road on a national scale. Recalling a period of history, one cannot help but feel lingering pain in the heart. I am telling the story of Teacher Yu's life with such a mood.

		"A member who participated in the 'May Fourth' Movement"

During the "December 9th" student patriotic movement, Teacher Yu comforted the Shanghai students going to Beijing to petition at the Wuxi Railway Station. She introduced herself to the students: "I am a member who participated in the 'May Fourth' Movement."

When the "May Fourth" Movement occurred, she participated in the work of the Shanghai Student Union, cooperating with Beijing and Tianjin students to carry out the patriotic movement. After participating in this student movement, her patriotic ideology improved and her horizons broadened. She came into contact with the simple people, and she began to realize the importance of the people's power in the patriotic movement.

Under the leadership and promotion of the Student Union, she united the students, raised funds through drama performances, and opened night schools, personally going to the night schools to teach classes every night, hoping to "awaken everyone's consciousness" through education. She felt that this matter had such a solemn meaning, and she placed the hope of the motherland's bright future on these simple people.

Because of her enthusiastic and fervent performance in the student movement, she attracted the attention of the reactionary authorities at the time. Her fianc√©, Mr. Tang Qingyi, had already gone to the United States to study. Her eldest brother, Fengbao, encouraged her to go abroad. That autumn, she exchanged the gold jewelry prepared for marriage, and she went to the United States.

		Ten Years of Educational Work

In early 1922, she returned to China after completing her studies at the Teachers College of Columbia University in the United States. In May, she married Mr. Tang.

After 1927, she successively served as the Director of the Expansion Education Department of the Central University District, the Section Chief of the Social Education Section of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, and the Director of the Research and Experimental Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Educational Institute, until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937. She steadfastly stayed in the social education position for a full ten years.

She worked hard to establish a social education system, using folk education centers, agricultural education centers, and libraries as institutions to improve the people's education level; and using mass schools as institutions to popularize folk education. She founded a school for cultivating folk education teachers, namely the Jiangsu Provincial Educational Institute. Although the scope of promotion was initially limited to Jiangsu Province, other provinces soon followed suit.

These ten years were her most hardworking years, and also her most fruitful years.

In the initial stage of creating a new cause, there were many opponents who made things difficult, obstructed, or sabotaged her plans. Stubborn elements clinging to orthodox ideas believed that school education was the only formal education, and that social education was insignificant. Bureaucrats from landlord and comprador bourgeois backgrounds had always despised the laboring people, and believed that focusing on folk education was asking for trouble. Factory owners, shopkeepers, landlords, and local bullies were even more afraid that educating the masses would be detrimental to them, and tried various ways to obstruct and sabotage. In order to persuade these people's prejudices, she did not know how much she spent persuading them. In order to eliminate obstacles, she did not know how many twists and turns she went through. In the development of the cause and the overcoming of difficulties, she also received many collaborators and sympathizers.

Teacher Yu had a very strong sense of career and was full of the spirit of hard work. Every time she established a new institution, she did not hesitate to travel by boat and car, and personally went to inspect the site. Whenever she encountered difficulties, she ran around to consult and appeal to all parties, or she would think deeply into the night and could not fall asleep. When inspecting in various places, regardless of rainy days or dark nights, she walked back and forth, unaware of fatigue. As long as she saw groups of young, old, young, farmers, apprentices, workers, and women studying diligently, her hard work would immediately turn into joy.

In these ten years, more than one hundred social education institutions were created through her planning or guidance and assistance, most of which were concentrated in Jiangsu Province. The more distant ones were the two folk education experimental zones in Luoyang, Henan, and Huaxian, Guangdong. In addition, almost all of the larger social education institutions in the country had her students or colleagues participating in them. She also gathered several people from across the country who were advocating research and engaging in practical work in social education, and established the "China Social Education Society" as a research and communication institution.

In terms of personal life, her five children were born during these ten years. What was regrettable was that Mr. Tang Qingyi lost his eyesight, which greatly affected her mentally.

		Keeping up with the times

Teacher Yu is always young, and she keeps up with the times.

In the year of "December 9th," after she comforted the Shanghai students at the Wuxi Railway Station, she wrote an open letter and published it in "The Masses Life," which was full of love for the motherland and the younger generation.

In the letter, she proposed: "The national liberation movement requires true success, and must be built on the foundation of the masses." She hoped that students would "organize themselves strictly" and "always stand on the position of the interests of the masses and engage in the great cause of saving the country." From these words, her progressive thinking can be seen. In the environment at the time and her position, it was courageous to say such things publicly.

When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, when Jiangnan was about to fall, she supported the old and led the young, went through thousands of dangers and difficulties, and went to Guilin with colleagues and students from the Jiangsu Educational Institute. She also went to Hankou alone to participate in refugee relief work.

She once gave a speech to the students of the Hubei Folk Education Training Class, advocating the use of folk education forces to extensively carry out the work of mobilizing, organizing, and training the masses. Using correct ideas such as "fighting for peace" and "eliminating aggressive war with revolutionary war" to improve the masses' understanding of the War of Resistance, and encouraging the masses to join the army. Advocating that the form of folk education during the war should be simplified, and that "furniture can be used as school equipment, and door panels can be used as blackboards."

At that time, the Kuomintang reactionaries were increasingly clearly moving in a direction that was contrary to the will of the people. Social education sponsored by the reactionary government had become a tool for confusing the masses and promoting fascist and dictatorial ideas. Where was there room for her advocacy of people's education that was combined with practice, had flesh and blood?

After that, in view of the importance of rear production work, she participated in the work of the "Women's New Movement Guidance Committee" and served as the Minister of the Production Department.

A textile experimental zone was established in Songkai, 200 miles upstream of Chongqing, with the Women's Production School as the center. Only the families of the resistance were enrolled, studying on the one hand, and learning textile technology on the other, specializing in the manufacture of military uniforms, blankets, gauze, and absorbent cotton. Several thousand women came to the school to study before and after. She often received letters from soldiers on the front line, thanking her for taking care of their families.

In order to exchange for foreign exchange, a sericulture experimental zone was also established in Leshan.

In Chongqing, she was persuaded to join the Kuomintang several times in just half a year, but she refused.

In March 1939, she returned to Shanghai to visit her family. Because her two daughters suffered from lung disease, she did not return to Chongqing. After that, she stayed in Shanghai and taught at Shanghai University and other schools. And presided over the worker education work of Shenxin Cotton Mill.

In 1943, I went to Shanghai from the mainland. I saw that her family's life was very difficult. But her will was still so strong, as if there was an invisible light shining on her.

Once, when I was sitting with her in a tram, she asked me if she was old. I said: "The appearance is a bit older, but the spirit seems to be younger." She smiled and said nothing.

		Close Quarters with the Reactionaries

After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Teacher Yu was invited to serve as the Director of the Social Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. On the one hand, she gradually restored the original social education institutions in Shanghai; on the other hand, she focused on promoting the work of folk schools.

In half a year, more than 50 folk schools and one experimental folk school were established. Most of the folk schools were located in factory areas and near suburban rural areas, enrolling more than 20,000 students. The scale of the experimental folk school was particularly large, from nurseries to middle school level remedial classes, as well as sewing classes and electrical cooperatives. Every day, from morning to night, there were more than 20 classes and more than 2,000 workers, citizens, women, and children, living and learning joyfully and intensely inside.

The folk school teachers she appointed were all young teachers with democratic ideas, and many of them were Communist Party members. Therefore, the folk education circle was full of democratic air. Compared with the middle and primary schools occupied by the majority of Kuomintang Sanmin Youth League members, the content and style showed two completely different atmospheres.

Because Teacher Yu saw that the actions of the reactionary government were becoming more and more cruel, she anticipated that she would not stay in the Education Bureau for long, and her thinking on promoting the work became more urgent. She went to the bureau early in the morning, and did not go home until the lights were on, and she ate cold bread in the office at noon, or went to eat a little noodles nearby, fearing that she would relax for a minute. Some colleagues learned from her and stayed with her, which made her very happy.

She also felt that she was not running education at that time, but conducting a struggle between democracy and anti-democracy in the position of education. These young people were not her colleagues, but her comrades-in-arms.

In the end, she left the Education Bureau, but still served as the principal of the experimental folk school. Her idea was that she could withdraw administratively, but the base of the cause must be retained. She was not passive, not retreating, she helped the student aid movement of young students; she carried out the education of shantytowns in western Shanghai; she opposed the police district system; at the memorial service for Mr. Tao Xingzhi, she scolded the authorities for stifling democratic education and coercing democratic educators.

The reactionary Kuomintang Shanghai authorities actually proposed a proposal to abolish the experimental folk school at the pseudo-Senate meeting in January 1947. Finally, under the invincible power of the masses, the school was retained. She said to the students: "Only when you enter the folk school can you feel warm." Many people were moved to tears by her words. At this time, because of frequent travels and deep stimulation, her heart disease and high blood pressure became increasingly serious, but she often ignored the doctor's advice and devoted herself to work.

After that, the shameless reactionaries sent a large number of special agents to infiltrate the school, some of whom openly carried guns. In the spring of 1948, the reactionary Shanghai education authorities asked her to resign. She said: "I will never resign, unless you dismiss me!"

All kinds of coercion made it difficult for her to stay in Shanghai. It happened that the American Aid China Association and other groups invited her to the United States to investigate basic education. In the autumn, she left the country and went far away.

		Returned to the People's Motherland

She lived overseas, always thinking of her motherland.

Last May, the army crossed the Yangtze River to the south, sweeping across Jiangnan in a few days, and seeing that the revolutionary situation had been determined. At this time, she was on her way back to China, and wrote in her diary with emotion:

"'Eating people' turns into 'serving the people', from injustice to peace, is a long struggle!"

She arrived in Hong Kong in mid-June. Transportation was blocked due to the blockade of the sea by the reactionaries, and she had to stay in Hong Kong. She read new books every day, finishing four or five books in two or three days, and also said that it "beats reading several years of university." In late July, she found a ship going north, because she "longed to return to the liberated areas, regardless of the dangers of the journey."

When she arrived in Beijing, she learned that she had been recommended by the national education community as a representative to the People's Political Consultative Conference. She felt honored to be able to participate in this founding ceremony. She was humble in everything, comparing herself to a primary school student.

In the meeting, she was excited by the great scene. She was moved by the devout characters.

When Chairman Mao was elected as the Chairman of the Central People's Government, she thought of the revolutionary fighters, the years of bloodshed, sacrifice, and experience of hardships that humans could not endure, only to have today. She was moved to tears.

When the Common Program was announced and passed, the audience stood up and applauded and cheered endlessly. In the frenzy of cheers and applause, she felt that the people in the audience were fused into a group, forgetting the existence of the individual, and determined to dedicate their entire body and mind.

After the meeting, she stayed in Beijing to serve as the Director of the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. She wrote to her family and said: "I am willing to use my meager experience and ability to serve the people and work hard for the construction of the new China."

In mid-October, she was hospitalized in Beijing Hospital due to increased blood pressure. The doctor advised her to rest and not work for the time being. She said that now is the time to let go and do work, and she did not want to leave work for the sake of her body.

After arriving at the Ministry of Education, she participated in every meeting, and stayed up late to discuss issues with colleagues. Colleagues advised her to cherish her body, or find opportunities for entertainment to adjust her spirit. She said: "I would rather die at my desk than waste time in the amusement park." Unexpectedly, she actually died!

Her death is a loss to the cultural and educational construction work of the new China!
