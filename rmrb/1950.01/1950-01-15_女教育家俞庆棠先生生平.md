Biography of Female Educator Ms. Yu Qingtang
		Hu Naiqiu
I never imagined that Ms. Yu Qingtang, having just stood on the new China's people's education post, and was preparing to devote her talent and hard work in a free and vigorous environment, to work wholeheartedly for the "laboring masses" that she had always been thinking about, when she suddenly fell!

In the past two decades, some educators in our country, for the sake of mass education, have braved thorns and thistles and struggled arduously. These people had many ideals in the past that could not be realized; today, our mass education, under the leadership of the great Mao Zedong Thought, is able to rapidly progress towards a bright and broad road on a national scale. Recalling a period of history, one cannot help but feel lingering pain in the heart. I am telling the story of Teacher Yu's life with such a mood.

		"A member who participated in the 'May Fourth' Movement"

During the "December 9th" student patriotic movement, Teacher Yu comforted the Shanghai students going to Beijing to petition at the Wuxi Railway Station. She introduced herself to the students: "I am a member who participated in the 'May Fourth' Movement."

When the "May Fourth" Movement occurred, she participated in the work of the Shanghai Student Union, cooperating with Beijing and Tianjin students to carry out the patriotic movement. After participating in this student movement, her patriotic ideology improved and her horizons broadened. She came into contact with the simple people, and she began to realize the importance of the people's power in the patriotic movement.

Under the leadership and promotion of the Student Union, she united the students, raised funds through drama performances, and opened night schools, personally going to the night schools to teach classes every night, hoping to "awaken everyone's consciousness" through education. She felt that this matter had such a solemn meaning, and she placed the hope of the motherland's bright future on these simple people.

Because of her enthusiastic and fervent performance in the student movement, she attracted the attention of the reactionary authorities at the time. Her fiancé, Mr. Tang Qingyi, had already gone to the United States to study. Her eldest brother, Fengbao, encouraged her to go abroad. That autumn, she exchanged the gold jewelry prepared for marriage, and she went to the United States.

		Ten Years of Educational Work

In early 1922, she returned to China after completing her studies at the Teachers College of Columbia University in the United States. In May, she married Mr. Tang.

After 1927, she successively served as the Director of the Expansion Education Department of the Central University District, the Section Chief of the Social Education Section of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, and the Director of the Research and Experimental Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Educational Institute, until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937. She steadfastly stayed in the social education position for a full ten years.

She worked hard to establish a social education system, using folk education centers, agricultural education centers, and libraries as institutions to improve the people's education level; and using mass schools as institutions to popularize folk education. She founded a school for cultivating folk education teachers, namely the Jiangsu Provincial Educational Institute. Although the scope of promotion was initially limited to Jiangsu Province, other provinces soon followed suit.

These ten years were her most hardworking years, and also her most fruitful years.

In the initial stage of creating a new cause, there were many opponents who made things difficult, obstructed, or sabotaged her plans. Stubborn elements clinging to orthodox ideas believed that school education was the only formal education, and that social education was insignificant. Bureaucrats from landlord and comprador bourgeois backgrounds had always despised the laboring people, and believed that focusing on folk education was asking for trouble. Factory owners, shopkeepers, landlords, and local bullies were even more afraid that educating the masses would be detrimental to them, and tried various ways to obstruct and sabotage. In order to persuade these people's prejudices, she did not know how much she spent persuading them. In order to eliminate obstacles, she did not know how many twists and turns she went through. In the development of the cause and the overcoming of difficulties, she also received many collaborators and sympathizers.

Teacher Yu had a very strong sense of career and was full of the spirit of hard work. Every time she established a new institution, she did not hesitate to travel by boat and car, and personally went to inspect the site. Whenever she encountered difficulties, she ran around to consult and appeal to all parties, or she would think deeply into the night and could not fall asleep. When inspecting in various places, regardless of rainy days or dark nights, she walked back and forth, unaware of fatigue. As long as she saw groups of young, old, young, farmers, apprentices, workers, and women studying diligently, her hard work would immediately turn into joy.

In these ten years, more than one hundred social education institutions were created through her planning or guidance and assistance, most of which were concentrated in Jiangsu Province. The more distant ones were the two folk education experimental zones in Luoyang, Henan, and Huaxian, Guangdong. In addition, almost all of the larger social education institutions in the country had her students or colleagues participating in them. She also gathered several people from across the country who were advocating research and engaging in practical work in social education, and established the "China Social Education Society" as a research and communication institution.

In terms of personal life, her five children were born during these ten years. What was regrettable was that Mr. Tang Qingyi lost his eyesight, which greatly affected her mentally.

		Keeping up with the times

Teacher Yu is always young, and she keeps up with the times.

In the year of "December 9th," after she comforted the Shanghai students at the Wuxi Railway Station, she wrote an open letter and published it in "The Masses Life," which was full of love for the motherland and the younger generation.

In the letter, she proposed: "The national liberation movement requires true success, and must be built on the foundation of the masses." She hoped that students would "organize themselves strictly" and "always stand on the position of the interests of the masses and engage in the great cause of saving the country." From these words, her progressive thinking can be seen. In the environment at the time and her position, it was courageous to say such things publicly.

When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, when Jiangnan was about to fall, she supported the old and led the young, went through thousands of dangers and difficulties, and went to Guilin with colleagues and students from the Jiangsu Educational Institute. She also went to Hankou alone to participate in refugee relief work.

She once gave a speech to the students of the Hubei Folk Education Training Class, advocating the use of folk education forces to extensively carry out the work of mobilizing, organizing, and training the masses. Using correct ideas such as "fighting for peace" and "eliminating aggressive war with revolutionary war" to improve the masses' understanding of the War of Resistance, and encouraging the masses to join the army. Advocating that the form of folk education during the war should be simplified, and that "furniture can be used as school equipment, and door panels can be used as blackboards."

At that time, the Kuomintang reactionaries were increasingly clearly moving in a direction that was contrary to the will of the people. Social education sponsored by the reactionary government had become a tool for confusing the masses and promoting fascist and dictatorial ideas. Where was there room for her advocacy of people's education that was combined with practice, had flesh and blood?

After that, in view of the importance of rear production work, she participated in the work of the "Women's New Movement Guidance Committee" and served as the Minister of the Production Department.

A textile experimental zone was established in Songkai, 200 miles upstream of Chongqing, with the Women's Production School as the center. Only the families of the resistance were enrolled, studying on the one hand, and learning textile technology on the other, specializing in the manufacture of military uniforms, blankets, gauze, and absorbent cotton. Several thousand women came to the school to study before and after. She often received letters from soldiers on the front line, thanking her for taking care of their families.

In order to exchange for foreign exchange, a sericulture experimental zone was also established in Leshan.

In Chongqing, she was persuaded to join the Kuomintang several times in just half a year, but she refused.

In March 1939, she returned to Shanghai to visit her family. Because her two daughters suffered from lung disease, she did not return to Chongqing. After that, she stayed in Shanghai and taught at Shanghai University and other schools. And presided over the worker education work of Shenxin Cotton Mill.

In 1943, I went to Shanghai from the mainland. I saw that her family's life was very difficult. But her will was still so strong, as if there was an invisible light shining on her.

Once, when I was sitting with her in a tram, she asked me if she was old. I said: "The appearance is a bit older, but the spirit seems to be younger." She smiled and said nothing.

		Close Quarters with the Reactionaries

After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Teacher Yu was invited to serve as the Director of the Social Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. On the one hand, she gradually restored the original social education institutions in Shanghai; on the other hand, she focused on promoting the work of folk schools.

In half a year, more than 50 folk schools and one experimental folk school were established. Most of the folk schools were located in factory areas and near suburban rural areas, enrolling more than 20,000 students. The scale of the experimental folk school was particularly large, from nurseries to middle school level remedial classes, as well as sewing classes and electrical cooperatives. Every day, from morning to night, there were more than 20 classes and more than 2,000 workers, citizens, women, and children, living and learning joyfully and intensely inside.

The folk school teachers she appointed were all young teachers with democratic ideas, and many of them were Communist Party members. Therefore, the folk education circle was full of democratic air. Compared with the middle and primary schools occupied by the majority of Kuomintang Sanmin Youth League members, the content and style showed two completely different atmospheres.

Because Teacher Yu saw that the actions of the reactionary government were becoming more and more cruel, she anticipated that she would not stay in the Education Bureau for long, and her thinking on promoting the work became more urgent. She went to the bureau early in the morning, and did not go home until the lights were on, and she ate cold bread in the office at noon, or went to eat a little noodles nearby, fearing that she would relax for a minute. Some colleagues learned from her and stayed with her, which made her very happy.

She also felt that she was not running education at that time, but conducting a struggle between democracy and anti-democracy in the position of education. These young people were not her colleagues, but her comrades-in-arms.

In the end, she left the Education Bureau, but still served as the principal of the experimental folk school. Her idea was that she could withdraw administratively, but the base of the cause must be retained. She was not passive, not retreating, she helped the student aid movement of young students; she carried out the education of shantytowns in western Shanghai; she opposed the police district system; at the memorial service for Mr. Tao Xingzhi, she scolded the authorities for stifling democratic education and coercing democratic educators.

The reactionary Kuomintang Shanghai authorities actually proposed a proposal to abolish the experimental folk school at the pseudo-Senate meeting in January 1947. Finally, under the invincible power of the masses, the school was retained. She said to the students: "Only when you enter the folk school can you feel warm." Many people were moved to tears by her words. At this time, because of frequent travels and deep stimulation, her heart disease and high blood pressure became increasingly serious, but she often ignored the doctor's advice and devoted herself to work.

After that, the shameless reactionaries sent a large number of special agents to infiltrate the school, some of whom openly carried guns. In the spring of 1948, the reactionary Shanghai education authorities asked her to resign. She said: "I will never resign, unless you dismiss me!"

All kinds of coercion made it difficult for her to stay in Shanghai. It happened that the American Aid China Association and other groups invited her to the United States to investigate basic education. In the autumn, she left the country and went far away.

		Returned to the People's Motherland

She lived overseas, always thinking of her motherland.

Last May, the army crossed the Yangtze River to the south, sweeping across Jiangnan in a few days, and seeing that the revolutionary situation had been determined. At this time, she was on her way back to China, and wrote in her diary with emotion:

"'Eating people' turns into 'serving the people', from injustice to peace, is a long struggle!"

She arrived in Hong Kong in mid-June. Transportation was blocked due to the blockade of the sea by the reactionaries, and she had to stay in Hong Kong. She read new books every day, finishing four or five books in two or three days, and also said that it "beats reading several years of university." In late July, she found a ship going north, because she "longed to return to the liberated areas, regardless of the dangers of the journey."

When she arrived in Beijing, she learned that she had been recommended by the national education community as a representative to the People's Political Consultative Conference. She felt honored to be able to participate in this founding ceremony. She was humble in everything, comparing herself to a primary school student.

In the meeting, she was excited by the great scene. She was moved by the devout characters.

When Chairman Mao was elected as the Chairman of the Central People's Government, she thought of the revolutionary fighters, the years of bloodshed, sacrifice, and experience of hardships that humans could not endure, only to have today. She was moved to tears.

When the Common Program was announced and passed, the audience stood up and applauded and cheered endlessly. In the frenzy of cheers and applause, she felt that the people in the audience were fused into a group, forgetting the existence of the individual, and determined to dedicate their entire body and mind.

After the meeting, she stayed in Beijing to serve as the Director of the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. She wrote to her family and said: "I am willing to use my meager experience and ability to serve the people and work hard for the construction of the new China."

In mid-October, she was hospitalized in Beijing Hospital due to increased blood pressure. The doctor advised her to rest and not work for the time being. She said that now is the time to let go and do work, and she did not want to leave work for the sake of her body.

After arriving at the Ministry of Education, she participated in every meeting, and stayed up late to discuss issues with colleagues. Colleagues advised her to cherish her body, or find opportunities for entertainment to adjust her spirit. She said: "I would rather die at my desk than waste time in the amusement park." Unexpectedly, she actually died!

Her death is a loss to the cultural and educational construction work of the new China!

    女教育家俞庆棠先生生平
    胡耐秋
    再也想不到，俞庆棠先生刚刚站立到新中国人民教育的岗位上，正预备竭尽她的才能与汗血在自由奋发的环境下，来为她一生念念不忘的“劳苦大众”痛痛快快工作的时候，她忽然倒下了！
    近二十年来，我国有一些教育工作者，为了大众的教育事业，曾经斩荆披棘，艰苦奋斗，这些人在过去有过许多理想，不能实现；今天我们的群众教育，在伟大的毛泽东思想领导下，得能在全国范围内迅速地向着光明宽阔的道路进展，回想过去的一段历史，不能不令人感到内心的余痛。我来述说俞师的生平，也正是怀着这样的心情。
            “参加‘五四’运动的一分子”
    “一二九”学生爱国运动时，俞师在无锡车站慰问上海赴京请愿的学生，她对学生自我介绍：“我是参加‘五四’运动的一分子。”
    “五四”运动发生时，她参加了上海学生会的工作，配合北京、天津学生，进行爱国运动。经过参加这次的学运工作以后，她的爱国思想提高了，眼界也扩大了，她接触了纯朴的人民，她开始认识到爱国运动中人民力量的重要。
    她在学生会的领导、推动下，团结了同学，演剧筹款，开办夜校，每晚亲自到夜校去教课，希望通过教育来“唤起大家的觉醒”。她觉得这件事有着如此庄严的意义，她对于这些纯朴的人，寄与祖国光明前途的希望。
    她因在学运工作中，表现得非常激烈热忱，引起了当时反动当局的注意，她的未婚夫唐庆诒先生已先赴美留学，她的大哥凤宝先生鼓励她出洋，这一年秋天，变换了准备结婚用的金饰，她到美国去了。
            十年教育工作
    一九二二年初，她从美国哥伦比亚大学师范学院学成归国。五月与唐先生结婚。
    一九二七年以后，她历任中央大学区扩充教育处处长，江苏省教育厅社会教育科科长，江苏省立教育学院研究实验部主任，直至一九三七年抗日战争爆发，她坚守在社教岗位上整整十年。
    她曾努力建立了社教制度，以民教馆、农教馆、图书馆为提高人民教育程度的机关；以民众学校为普及民教的机关。创办了培植民教师资的学校，即江苏省立教育学院。起初推行的范围虽只限于江苏一省，但不久各省先后仿效实行。
    这十年，是她最辛勤的十年，也是她收获最丰富的十年。
    在新事业的创建阶段，有着不少反对者对她的计划留难、阻碍或破坏。紧抱着正统观念的顽固分子，以为学校教育才是正式的教育，社会教育无足轻重。地主及买办资产阶级出身的官僚，向来贱视劳苦人民，认为着力办理民教是寻找麻烦。厂主店东地主豪绅，更怕把民众教聪明了于他们不利，想种种办法来阻梗破坏。为了说服这些人的成见，不知费了多少唇舌。为了消除障碍，也不知经过多少周折。在事业的开展和困难的克服中，她也曾经得到过不少的合作者与同情者。
    俞师的事业心极强，富于刻苦的精神，每创设一个新机关，她不辞舟车劳顿，必亲往察勘地址。每遇有困难，向各方奔走磋商呼吁，或深夜长思不能入睡。在各地视察，不管雨天黑夜，往返步行，不知疲劳。她只要看到年青的、年老的、年少的、农民、学徒、工人、妇女成群的在埋头学习，她的辛劳立刻化为欢愉了。
    在这十年中，经她擘划或指导协助而创设的社教机关，共有百余处，大部分集中在江苏省。较远的有河南洛阳、广东花县两个民教实验区。此外，国内较大的社教机关，也差不多都有她的学生或者同事参加在内。她又集结了全国在社教方面提倡研究及从事实际工作的人员数人，成立“中国社会教育社”，作为研究沟通的机构。
    私人生活方面，在这十年中，她的子女五人都已出世，所遗憾的是唐庆诒先生的双目失明，使她精神上受到很大影响。
            跟着时代前进
    俞师永远是年青的，她跟着时代前进。
    “一二九”那年，她在无锡车站慰问上海学生之后，又写了一封公开信，投在《大众生活》上发表，充溢着对祖国对青年一代的热爱。
    她在信上提出：“民族解放运动要求真正成功，必须建筑在大众基础之上。”希望学生“组织严密”，“永远站在大众利益的立场上，从事救国的伟业”。从这些话语上可以看出她的进步思想。以当时的环境和她的地位，公开说出这样的话，是表现有勇气的。
    抗日战争发生，江南快要沦陷的时候，她扶老携幼，经过了千险万难，和江苏教育学院的同事学生一同到了桂林。她又只身到汉口，参加难民救济工作。
    她有一次对湖北民教训练班学生演讲，主张用民教力量，广泛展开动员、组织、训练民众的工作。用“为和平而战”“以革命战争消灭侵略战争”等正确主张提高民众对抗战的认识，鼓励民众投军。主张战时民教的形式要简单化，不妨“用家具作校具，用门板作黑板”。
    那时，国民党反动派已日益明显地走向与人民意志相背的道路。反动政府主办的社会教育，都已成为迷惑民众，宣传法西斯独裁思想的工具。像她所主张鼓吹的，与实际结合的，有血有肉的民众教育，那里还有发挥的余地？
    此后，她鉴于后方生产工作的重要，参加了“妇女新运指导委员会”的工作，担任生产部部长。
    在重庆上游二百里的淞溉创设了纺织实验区，以妇女生产学校为中心，专招抗属入学，一面读书，一面学习纺织技术，专制军服布、军毯、纱布、药棉，前后来校学习的妇女有几千人。她常收到前线士兵来信，对她照顾他们的家属表示感谢。
    为换取外汇，又在乐山设立了蚕丝实验区。
    在重庆仅仅半载，曾几度被劝参加国民党，她都拒绝了。
    一九三九年三月，返沪探望家人，因两女患肺病，即不再回渝。此后，留沪在沪江大学等校任教。并主持申新纱厂的工人教育工作。
    一九四三年，我从内地到上海。看到她全家的生活非常艰苦。但是意志还是那末坚强，好像有一种看不见的光亮在照耀着她。
    有一次，和她同座在电车里，她问我，她老了没有。我说：“形容是老了一些，但精神似乎更年青了。”她微笑着不做声。
            与反动派短兵相接
    抗战结束后，俞师又被约担任上海市教育局社会教育处处长。一面将上海原有的社教机关逐步恢复；一面着重推广民校工作。
    在半年内创立了五十余所民校，及一所实验民众学校。民校大半设在工厂区及近郊农村，招收两万多个学生。实验民校的规模尤其大，从托儿所到中学程度的补习班，还有缝纫班，电工合作社，每天从早到晚，有二十多班，二千多个工人、市民、妇女、儿童，在里面欢跃紧张地生活着、学习着。
    经她任用的民校教师，都是有民主思想的青年教师，并且有不少是共产党员。因此，使民教的圈子里充满了民主的空气。和为多数国民党三青团所占据的中小学比较，在内容和作风上，表现着两种绝然不同的气氛。
    俞师因为看到反动政府的作为愈益凶残，她预料到在教育局不会久留，推进工作的思想愈加急切。她清早到局，亮了灯还迟迟不回家，中午在办公室吃冷面包，或者去到附近吃一点面，深恐放松一分钟。一部分同事学他的样，跟她在一起，她非常高兴。
    她也感觉到：她那时不是在办教育，而是在教育的岗位上进行民主与反民主的斗争。这些青年人，不是她的同事，而是她的战友。
    最后她离开了教育局，但是仍旧担任实验民校的校长，她的意思是行政上可以撤退，事业的据点必须保留。她不消极，不退缩，她帮助青年学生的助学运动；她开展了沪西的棚户教育；她反对警管区制；她在陶行知先生的追悼会上，痛骂当局扼杀民主教育，威迫民主教育家。
    反动的国民党上海当局，在一九四七年一月的伪参议会上，竟然提出撤消实验民校的议案。终于在无可战胜的群众力量下面，这个学校保留下来了。她对学生谈话说：“只有走进民校才感觉温暖”。许多人被她的话感动得下泪。这时她因经常奔波，并受刺激很深，心脏病和血压高症，渐趋严重，但常常不听医生的劝告，奋不顾身地从事工作。
    此后，无耻的反动派，派了大批的特务分子混入学校，有的公然带着枪。一九四八年春天，反动的上海教育当局要她辞职，她说：“我决不辞职，除非撤我的职！”
    种种的威逼，使她难以在上海耽下去。恰有美国援华会等团体，邀她赴美考察基本教育。秋天，她离国远行了。
            回到了人民的祖国
    她身居海外，时时怀念着祖国。
    去年五月，大军渡江南下，数日内席卷江南，眼看革命局势已定。这时，她正在归国途中，感慨地在日记本上写道：
    “‘吃人’变为‘为人民服务’不平到平，是一个久长的奋斗！”
    六月中旬到达香港，交通因反动派在海面施行封锁而遭阻塞，不得已滞留在港。每日翻阅新书，二三日内阅毕四五册，还说“胜读几年大学”。   七月下旬寻得北上的便船，她因“渴盼回解放区，行程凶吉，在所不计。”
    到了北京，她才知道已被全国教育界推为人民政治协商会议的代表。她感到光荣，能参加这个立国的盛会。她凡事虚心，比仿自己是在做小学生。
    在会议中，她为伟大的场面而兴奋。为虔诚的人物而激动。
    当毛主席当选为中央人民政府主席的时候，她因念及革命战士们，多少年来的流血、牺牲、并经历人类不能忍受的艰辛，才有今天。她感奋得流下泪来。
    当共同纲领宣布通过的时候，全场起立，鼓掌欢呼不息。在狂热的欢呼声和掌声里，她感觉全场的人融和成一团，忘掉了个人的存在，决心把整个的身心交献出来。
    会后，她留京担任中央人民政府教育部社会教育司司长。她写信给家人说：“愿以微薄的经验和能力，为人民服务，为新中国建设而努力。”
    十月中旬，曾因血压增高住北京医院，医生劝她休养暂不工作。她表示目前正是可以放开手做工作的时候，不愿为了身体离开工作。
    到教育部以后，每种会议必参加，夜深还找同事商讨问题，同事劝她珍惜身体，或找一点娱乐的机会调剂精神，她说：“我宁愿死在办公桌前，不愿消磨在游艺场里。”想不到她竟然死了！
    她的死，在新中国文教建设工作上，是一个损失！
                                      一九五○、一、一○
