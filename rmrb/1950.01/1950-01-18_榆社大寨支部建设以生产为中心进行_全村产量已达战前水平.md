    Yushe Dazhai Branch Construction Focuses on Production; Village Output Reaches Pre-War Levels
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Communist Party branch of Dazhai Village, Yushe, Shanxi (old liberated area), has achieved successes and accumulated experience in strengthening branch construction by focusing on leading mass production, thereby enhancing the Party's leadership over production. Despite the village's lack of labor and livestock, the actual autumn grain harvest reached 3,610 shi and 4 dou, an increase of 688 shi and 2 dou compared to normal years, representing an increase of nearly 20%. The village's production has basically reached pre-war levels, and farming techniques have improved significantly compared to before the war. Last year, at the county's model worker conference, it was selected as a first-class model village.
    The Dazhai branch currently has thirty-one Party members who are active and enthusiastic in their work. After the rectification campaign in 1948, the branch cleared up undemocratic and administrative commandism styles within the Party, and Party members established labor concepts and a mass viewpoint. In particular, after studying the Party constitution, they understood that to move towards socialism, they must build the new democratic society well and lead the peasants to increase production. Secondly, a system of democratic life within the Party was established, giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all Party members. Every task is discussed by all Party members. Branch Secretary Chang Fu can lead by example, attributing achievements in his work to everyone and reviewing his own shortcomings to everyone. Under his influence, criticism and self-criticism within the Party have been strengthened and conducted in a lively manner, enabling all Party members to be gradually transformed. A few Party members who were not actively working or not strong in labor have all become good laborers and production leaders in last year's production. Thirdly, attention is paid to cultivating the Party's backbone for production leadership. Since the admission of labor hero Zhi Quan into the Party in 1946, the Party's role in leading production has significantly improved. Under his influence and specific organizational leadership, the wheat seedling oil drought (pests) was effectively eliminated last summer, saving 120 mu of wheat fields, and promoting the selection of more than 40 shi of superior wheat seeds throughout the village. Zhi Quan can educate the masses using their own practical experience and comparisons of good and bad, enabling the village's agricultural technology to gradually improve. Last summer, the branch was awarded the title of Model Branch by the higher-level Party committee during the weeding season.
    The basic experiences of the Dazhai branch in leading mass production are as follows: 1. Planned and organized democratic leadership. Based on the requirements of higher authorities and the actual conditions of the village, the branch congress formulates annual and sectional production plans. Between each section, there is a branch congress to summarize the work of the previous section, propose the central task and specific requirements of the next section, and submit them to the People's Representative Conference for discussion, so that the branch's plan becomes the plan of the entire village. In the implementation, Party members set an example on the one hand and use practical results to carry out propaganda and education to the masses on the other hand, starting with their own mutual aid teams and gradually influencing and promoting the entire village. 2. Pay attention to ideological mobilization, unite and utilize activists, and commend the good and criticize the bad at any time. For example, when selecting seeds last autumn, in order to overcome the masses' fear of trouble, the branch organized more than 60 Party members, cadres, hero models, and activists to lead the masses to actually inspect and observe, so that everyone realized the importance of seed selection. At the same time, attention is paid to uniting and cultivating skilled technicians and sincerely learning from them to enrich leadership experience. 3. Combining in-depth inspection with specific guidance. For example, during weeding last summer, most seedlings were weeded three times. After inspection, it was found that Zhang Zhuan Guan falsely claimed to have finished weeding without actually doing three passes. Therefore, a comprehensive and further inspection was carried out, and it was found that more than 130 mu of autumn seedlings in the village had not been weeded three times. After education, the masses re-weeded three times. 4. Through summarizing work, concentrate the practical experience of Party members and the masses to improve the awareness of Party members and the masses. Last year, this method was used, starting from the weeding inspection and continuing throughout all aspects of the three autumn harvests. From the summary education of each stage, Party members and the masses realized that only by responding to the Party's call to organize, pay attention to technology, process and add manure, can more grain be produced, changing the previous view that more grain production was a matter of "heavenly years."

    榆社大寨支部建设以生产为中心进行
    全村产量已达战前水平
    【本报讯】山西榆社大寨村（老区）中共支部在加强支部建设中，以领导群众生产为中心，提高了党对生产的领导作用，获得成绩与经验。该村劳力畜力缺乏，但去秋实收粮达三千六百一十石四斗，比常年多打粮六百八十八石二斗，增产将近二成。全村生产基本上已达战前水平；耕作技术已远较战前提高。去年全县劳模大会上，被选为头等模范村。
    大寨支部现有党员三十一人，工作积极热情。一九四八年经过整党，支部清算了党内不民主与行政命令作风，党员树立了劳动观念与群众观点；特别是经过党章教育，懂得了要想走向社会主义，必须把新民主主义社会建设好，必须领导农民增产。其次，建立了党内民主生活制度，发挥了全体党员的积极性与创造性。每一工作，都经过全体党员讨论。支部书记昌福能够以身作则，工作有成绩归给大家，自己有缺点向大家检讨，在他的影响之下，加强了党内的批评与自我批评，而且进行得生动活泼，使全体党员得到逐步改造。少数不积极工作或劳动不强的党员，在去年生产中，都已成为劳动好手与生产领导者。第三，注意培养党的生产领导骨干。自一九四六年吸收劳动英雄志全入党以后，党对生产领导的作用显著提高。在他的影响与具体组织领导之下，去年夏天有效地消灭了麦苗的油旱（害虫），救出一百二十亩麦田，并推动全村选出优良麦种四十余石。志全能用群众切身经验与好坏对比的方法，教育群众，使全村农业技术能够逐渐提高。去夏锄苗时，该支部被上级党委奖为模范支部。
    大寨支部领导群众生产的基本经验有以下几点：一、有计划有组织的民主领导。依据上级要求与本村实际情况，经支部大会订出全年与各段生产计划；每段之间有一次支部大会，总结上段工作，提出下段中心与具体要求，提交人民代表会讨论，使支部的计划变成全村群众的计划。在执行中，党员一面以身作则，一面用实际成果向群众进行宣传教育，并首先从自己互助组做起，逐步影响推动全村。二、重视思想发动，团结运用积极分子，随时表扬好的，批评坏的。如去秋选种时，为克服群众怕麻烦思想，支部即组织了党员干部、英雄模范、积极分子六十余人，带领群众实际检查观摩，使大家认识选种的重要。同时注意团结培养技术能手，诚恳向其学习，以丰富领导经验。三、深入检查与具体指导相结合。如去夏锄苗时，大部锄了三遍，经检查，发现张砖管本来没上三锄就假说锄完了。于是就作了全面的进一步的检查，发现全村有一百三十多亩秋苗未上三锄，经过教育，群众才补锄了三次。四、通过总结工作，集中党员群众切身经验，提高党员群众觉悟。去年运用这一方法，从锄苗大检查开始，一直贯彻到三秋工作的各个环节中。从各段的总结教育中，使党员与群众认识了只有响应党的号召：组织起来，讲究技术，加工加粪，才能多打粮食；改变了以前多打粮食是“天年”的看法。
