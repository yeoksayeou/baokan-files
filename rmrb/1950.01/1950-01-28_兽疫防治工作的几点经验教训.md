Several Experiences and Lessons from Animal Disease Prevention and Control Work
Animal Disease Prevention Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture

During the Anti-Japanese War, animal disease prevention and control work could not be carried out effectively due to the enemy's blockade, division, and the shortage and lack of medicines, equipment, and veterinarians. At that time, the People's Government did its best to mobilize traditional Chinese medicine practitioners or use effective folk remedies to help the masses treat and preserve some of their livestock from death. Last year, after the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, transportation gradually recovered, and animal disease prevention work had preliminary conditions. At that time, a serious outbreak of rinderpest was prevalent in the Chabei area, killing four to five thousand cattle, and it was still spreading. The former North China People's Government immediately organized a large number of veterinarians, with the support of the Northeast Anti-Epidemic Team, and with the strong cooperation of the party, government, army, and people of Chahar Province, the rinderpest in Chabei was completely eradicated in less than two months. Subsequently, animal disease prevention and control work was carried out in key areas of Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong, and in most areas of Northeast China and Inner Mongolia. In 1949, a total of more than 3.77 million cattle and horses were vaccinated and treated in the North China and Northeast regions.

However, due to the deep and heavy disasters left to the people by the past reactionary bureaucrat government, the stubborn roots of various animal diseases have spread widely in various places, and epidemics are still occurring constantly in various places. According to statistics for the current month and a half alone, 4,468 cattle (including a few horses and donkeys) have died from disease in provinces such as Henan, Shanxi, Hebei, Pingyuan, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Gansu, which means that more than 4,000 farming families have lost their draught animals. Now, governments and people in various places are organizing all their forces to carry out prevention and control work in the areas where diseases have occurred. Therefore, we would like to provide the following experiences and lessons from the 1949 animal disease prevention work for reference in various places:

(1) Concentrate forces, surround the epidemic area, strictly blockade it, and actively prevent those who are not infected. Under such measures, the rinderpest in eight counties of Chabei was completely eradicated in less than two months, saving 150,000 draught cattle from the epidemic. Conversely, dispersing forces and passively treating the disease will cause the epidemic to spread and cause losses. For example, anthrax in livestock in Henan spread in this situation and has spread to sixteen or seventeen counties, killing more than two thousand cattle.

(2) Leaders should take responsibility and take action personally. In emergency prevention and control, other work can be temporarily suspended to focus on epidemic prevention. "Epidemic prevention is like fighting a fire." The longer it is delayed, the greater the loss. As long as the organizational work is done well, the vaccination period will not be too long. For example, during the prevention and control of rinderpest in Chabei, the leaders at all levels of the province, prefecture, and county personally led and drove the district and village cadres to pay more attention to the epidemic prevention work. The epidemic prevention personnel were also greatly encouraged by the support of the masses, and their work enthusiasm was greatly improved. The first team increased from injecting 100 cattle a day to injecting 3,000 cattle a day, completing the injection of 20,967 cattle in Kangbao County within seven days, increasing work efficiency dozens of times.

(3) It is necessary to grasp the truth of the epidemic situation and the safety of the technology. Eliminate the concerns of the masses with practical and effective results. Do not create chaos in the prevention and control work and cause the masses to lose confidence. Repeatedly explain the disinfection and isolation methods that the masses can do to the masses, and always pay attention to checking the potency of the medicine and the effect after prevention and control. Last July, Suiyuan used rabbit-adapted virus to prevent rinderpest, but the virulent blood had already expired, and it was all in vain. In Duolun, seven cattle died due to poor disinfection after injection, causing dissatisfaction among the cattle owners. This is a lesson that should be paid attention to.

(4) In emergency epidemic prevention, it is necessary to establish a unified organizational leadership (such as an animal disease prevention and control committee, or a prevention and control guidance department, etc.), and closely organize and combine administrative, technical, and mass efforts, clarify responsibilities, and cooperate in carrying out the work. The experience of Chahar is "Rather have cattle waiting for people than people waiting for cattle." Because the organization and concentration of cattle herds takes time, especially when there are not many epidemic prevention personnel and the medicine expires, it must be done without delay or error.

(5) Strengthen the epidemic situation communication in various regions, have scientific foresight, and be highly vigilant. Old epidemic areas should take the initiative to prevent during the incubation period of the disease. And be vigilant about animal diseases in neighboring areas spreading to this area. Organize the masses to prevent it as early as possible. For example, the recent rinderpest in Yanbei was transmitted from Suiyuan, and the anthrax in Julu, Hebei, was transmitted from Henan Province. All of these were caused by insufficient information and communication beforehand, lack of vigilance, and paralysis and fluke mentality. However, once an epidemic occurs at the junction of the two regions, it is necessary to take the initiative to contact each other, cooperate with each other, and concentrate forces to eliminate it. For example, the joint prevention organization in Chabei and Suiyuan for epidemic prevention in Yanbei was very good and achieved great results.

    兽疫防治工作的几点经验教训
    中央人民政府农业部畜牧兽医局
    兽疫防治工作，在抗战期间由于敌人的封锁分割及药械短少和缺乏，兽医等困难未能很好的开展，当时人民政府只是尽一切努力动员中医，或利用民间有效方剂，帮助群众治疗，保存了群众一部牲畜免于死亡。去年京津解放后，交通逐渐恢复，兽防工作初步有了条件。当时察北一带正流行严重的牛瘟，死牛四五千头，后仍在蔓延，前华北人民政府立即组织了大批兽医人员，在东北防疫队的支援下，经察省党政军民的有力配合，不到两个月时间，察北牛瘟完全扑灭。继之在河北、山西、山东之重点地区，和东北、内蒙之大部地区，均进行了兽疫防治工作。总计在一九四九年华北和东北两区预防和治疗牛马共计三百七十七万余头。
    但由于过去的反动官僚政府，给人民遗留下的灾害至深且重，各种兽疫的顽固种根在各地蔓延很广，至今各地疫情仍在不断发生，仅就目前一个半月统计：河南、山西、河北、平原、察哈尔、绥远、甘肃等省，因病疫死牛四千四百六十八头（其中有少数马和驴），就是说有四千多户的农民失去了自己的耕畜，现在各地政府和人民正在组织一切力量向已发生病疫的地区展开着防治工作，因此，特将一九四九年兽防工作中的几点经验教训提供各地参考：
    （一）集中力量，包围疫区，严格封锁，未患者要主动预防。在这样措施下，察北八个县的牛瘟，不到两月即全部扑灭，使十五万头耕牛得免于疫。反之，力量分散，被动的治疗，会使病疫蔓延成灾，招致损失。如河南的牲畜炭疽就在这样情况下流行起来，已蔓延到十六七县，死牛两千余头。
    （二）首长负责，亲自动手，在紧急防治中其他工作可暂缓办理，以全力进行防疫，“防疫如救火”，多延长一天，就受到很大的损失，只要组织工作做好，预防注射期间并不会太长。如察北防治牛瘟时，由省和专区县的各级首长，亲自领导带动下，提高了区村干部对防疫工作的重视，防疫人员也因受到群众的拥护，工作情绪大大提高。第一队由一天注射一百头增加到一天注射三千头，七天之内完成了康保全县两万零九百六十七头牛的注射，工作效率提高数十倍。
    （三）要掌握住疫情的真实性和技术的安全。用实际有效的成绩消除群众的顾虑，不要在防治工作中出了乱子，使群众失掉信心。把群众能办到的消毒隔离办法反复的向群众讲解，经常注意检查药力和防治后的效果。绥远去年七月用兔化毒预防牛瘟，结果毒血早已失效，徒劳无功。多伦因消毒不良，注射了的牛只死了七头，引起牛主不满。这是很应注意的教训。
    （四）在紧急防疫中，要建立统一的组织领导（如兽疫防治委员会，或防治指导部等），将行政，技术和群众密切的组织结合起来，明确职责，配合进行。察哈尔的经验是“宁要牛等人，不要人等牛”。因为牛群的组织和集中比较费时，特别是防疫人员不多，药品过时则失效，必须做到不能误时误事。
    （五）加强各地区的疫情联络，要有科学的预见，和高度警惕。老疫区在病疫潜伏期间就要主动预防。并警惕邻区兽疫延及本区。及早组织群众预防。如最近雁北的牛瘟系由绥远传来，河北巨鹿的炭疽系由河南境内传来，全都是事前情报连络不够，警惕性不高，麻痹侥幸思想所造成。但如在两区交界一旦发生疫情，则须主动联系，互相配合，集中力量扑灭之。如察绥在雁北防疫的联防组织很好，收效就大。
