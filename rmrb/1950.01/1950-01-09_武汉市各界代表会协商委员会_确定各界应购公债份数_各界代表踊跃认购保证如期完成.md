Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 8th: The Wuhan City People's Representatives Consultative Committee held its first meeting on the 6th and 7th, with 31 members in attendance. The main agenda of this meeting was to discuss the promotion of public bonds, while also determining the organization and personnel of the committee. On the first day of the meeting, Zhang Pinghua, the representative of the CCP in Wuhan, was elected as the chairman of the Consultative Committee, and Ma Zhemin, the representative of the China Democratic League in Wuhan, Zhao Min, the representative of the workers, Chen Jingshe, the representative of the industrial and commercial sector, and He Dingjie, the representative of the cultural and educational sector, were elected as vice-chairmen. In order to study the various work issues in Wuhan and to gather people's opinions for consultation, the Second Representatives' Conference had approved the establishment of seven research committees within the Consultative Committee: cultural construction, labor-management relations, municipal construction, health, social relief, finance and economics, and docks. The members of these research committees have also been recommended by this Consultative Committee meeting. The second day of the meeting focused on discussing the issue of promoting Victory Inflation-Adjusted Public Bonds. After repeated consultations, the quotas for public bond subscriptions for all sectors in Wuhan City were approved, totaling 5 million shares for the industrial and commercial sector, 650,000 shares for the wealthy, 400,000 shares for commercial firms, 220,000 shares for workers, 60,000 shares for the cultural sector, 60,000 shares for government agencies and military units, 50,000 shares for suburban rural areas, 50,000 shares for citizens (including street vendors), 10,000 shares for students, and 10,000 shares for women, totaling 6,510,000 shares, exceeding the first-phase public bond subscription task for Wuhan City by 10,000 shares. This agreement has been reviewed and approved by the Wuhan Municipal People's Government. The representatives from all sectors attending the meeting unanimously agreed that sharing this task is glorious, because the Central People's Government's issuance this time is to reduce the amount of banknotes issued and stabilize prices, and the public bond issuance method is also very reasonable, and purchasing public bonds is equivalent to saving. Representatives from all sectors enthusiastically subscribed. The number of subscriptions for workers was originally set at 200,000 shares, but the workers' representatives voluntarily proposed to increase it by 20,000 shares. The women's sector was not assigned a task during the consultation, but they voluntarily proposed at the meeting that, in addition to doing their utmost to assist all sectors in carrying out promotional work, they are willing to undertake 10,000 shares. The student sector proposed that they not only have to complete their assigned task by saving on stationery expenses, but also strive to exceed their task. Although the industrial and commercial sector has a larger number, they also proposed that they must complete the task on schedule. Representatives from the cultural sector, government agencies, military units, suburban rural areas, etc. also guaranteed to complete the task.

    武汉市各界代表会协商委员会
    确定各界应购公债份数
    各界代表踊跃认购保证如期完成
    【新华社汉口八日电】武汉市各界代表会协商委员会于六、七两日举行首次会议，出席委员三十一人。这次会议的主要议程是讨论公债推销问题，同时确定了该委员会的组织机构及人事。会议第一日选举了武汉市中共代表张平化为协商委员会主席，武汉中国民主同盟代表马哲民、职工代表赵敏、工商业界代表陈经畲、文化教育界代表何定杰为副主席。为研究武汉市种种工作问题和集中人民意见以便协商，二次代表会议曾通过在协商委员会内设立文化建设、劳资关系、市政建设、卫生、社会救济、财经、码头等七个研究委员会。这些研究委员会委员亦已由此次协商委员会会议推定。会议第二日着重讨论了推销胜利折实公债问题，经反复协商，通过了武汉市各界应购公债分数，计工商界五百万分，富有者六十五万分，行商四十万分，工人二十二万分，文化界六万分，机关部队六万分，市郊农村五万分，市民（摊贩在内）五万分，学生一万分，妇女一万分，共六百五十一万分，超过武汉市第一期应购公债任务一万分。此一协议业经武汉市人民政府审查批准。出席这次会议的各界代表一致认为分担这一任务是光荣的，因为中央人民政府这次发行是为了减少发行钞票的数量，安定物价，而且公债发行方式也很合理，购买公债等于储蓄。各界代表都踊跃认购。工人方面的认购数目原确定为二十万分，经工人代表们自动提出增加两万分。妇女界在协商时并未分到任务，但她们在会上自动提出除尽一切力量协助各界进行推销工作外，并愿担任一万分。学生界提出他们不只要在节省文具费用中完成他们分担的任务，并提出一定争取超出他们的任务。工商界数目字虽较大，他们同样提出一定如期完成任务。文化界、机关、部队、市郊农村等的代表们都同样保证完成任务。
