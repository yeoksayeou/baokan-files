The Soviet Union's other permanent supreme state organ is the Council of Ministers of the USSR, which is the Soviet government.

The Council of Ministers of the USSR is formed at a joint session of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

At the first session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in March 1946, the Soviet government was formed as follows: The Chairman of the previous government, Stalin, submitted a written application to the Presidium of the joint session of the two chambers, requesting the Supreme Soviet to remove the government from its functions. A representative spoke and, with unanimous approval, stated that the Supreme Soviet unanimously expressed complete confidence in the government. The Supreme Soviet accepted the government's application and unanimously entrusted Stalin with drafting a list of the new government. At the second joint session of the two chambers, the chairman announced that he had received Stalin's recommendations regarding the members of the new government. After speeches and discussions by the representatives, the chairman announced: No one opposed the list of candidates for government members, and no representative proposed removing any candidate during the individual discussions. Thus, the entire list of ministers of the various departments of the Soviet Union proposed by Stalin was put to a vote and unanimously approved by the assembly amidst warm applause and cheers.

Stalin was elected Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and concurrently Minister of the Armed Forces. Stalin's closest comrade-in-arms, Molotov, was approved as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

On March 3, 1947, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, in view of the heavy workload of Stalin's primary duties, and in accordance with Stalin's request, relieved him of his position as Minister of the Armed Forces.

The powers and composition of the Council of Ministers are stipulated by the Soviet Constitution.

The Council of Ministers of the USSR issues decisions and directives based on and for the implementation of existing all-Union laws and monitors their implementation. Its resolutions and directives are binding throughout the Soviet Union.

The Council of Ministers of the USSR has the following important duties: maintaining social order; protecting national interests; protecting the rights of citizens; determining the annual number of citizens to be drafted into military service; leading the general construction of the national armed forces; and leading general foreign relations.

The Council of Ministers of the USSR is vested with a series of important powers in the field of managing the national economy. It endeavors to implement the state budget and the Soviet national economic plan, and to consolidate credit and monetary affairs.

The Council of Ministers of the USSR unifies and directs the entire work of the ministries of the USSR and other agencies under their jurisdiction.

The government ministries are the agencies in charge of state administration and the various sectors of the people's economy. The minister is entrusted with the leadership of his department. Under him is a council of officials. He issues orders within the scope of his administrative department.

The ministries of the USSR are divided into two types: all-Union ministries and Union-republic ministries.

The all-Union ministries manage those sectors of the national economy that have all-Union significance and require the establishment of an all-Union center to manage them. The Soviet Constitution stipulates that these sectors are coal, petroleum, electricity, metals, machinery, chemical products, and other industrial sectors; national armed forces; certain other industrial sectors; transportation; post and telecommunications; and foreign trade.

The Union-republic ministries manage sectors of the national economy and state administration that have all-Union significance, and the leadership of these sectors can be carried out through the ministries of the same name in the Union republics. The leadership of a certain sector of the national economy or state administration by the all-Union central organs through the system of ministries of the Union republics is coordinated with the direct leadership of this sector by the corresponding departments of the Union republics. The Soviet Constitution stipulates that these sectors are food industry, textile industry, forestry industry, agriculture, and certain other sectors, as well as trade.

The Soviet Constitution stipulates that the ministries of the Union republics also manage the national armed forces, foreign relations, state security, state inspection, finance, health care, and others.

The Council of Ministers of the USSR has the right to repeal the orders and instructions of the ministers of the USSR, and it has the right to suspend the decisions and directives of the Councils of Ministers of the Union republics regarding those administrative and economic departments which are assigned to the management of the USSR by the Constitution.

Therefore, the Council of Ministers of the USSR is the highest executive and administrative organ of the Soviet state power. It is responsible to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and reports to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

    苏联国家管理机关——部长会议
    卡尔宾斯基著

    苏联另一个常设的最高国家机关，是苏联部长会议，即苏联政府。
    苏联部长会议是在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议上成立的。
    一九四六年三月苏联最高苏维埃第一次会议上，苏联政府曾是这样组成的：前届政府主席斯大林向两院联席会议主席提出书面申请书，要求最高苏维埃党除政府职权。一个代表发言，并在全体赞成之下，说最高苏维埃一致表示完全信任政府。最高苏维埃接受政府的申请，并一致委托斯大林拟具新政府的名单。在两院第二次联席会议上，主席宣布已接到斯大林关于新政府成员的建议。在代表们发言讨论后，主席宣布：没有人反对政府委员候选人名单，逐人讨论时没有一个代表主张删除那个候选人。这样，斯大林所提出的苏联各部部长全部名单，就付表决，并在热烈的鼓掌和欢呼声中被大会一致通过了。
    斯大林当选为苏联部长会议主席兼武装部队部部长。斯大林的最亲信的战友莫洛托夫被批准为部长会议副主席和外交部长。
    一九四七年三月三日，苏联最高苏维埃主席团，鉴于斯大林的基本工作繁重，依照斯大林的请求，解除了他的武装部队部部长的职务。
    部长会议的职权及其成份是由苏联宪法规定的。
    苏联部长会议根据并为执行现行的全联盟法律，颁布决定和指令，并检查它们的执行情形。它的决议和指令，在全苏联境内具有拘束力。
    苏联部长会议负有下列重要的职务：即维持社会秩序；保护国家利益；保护公民权利；规定每年应征兵役的公民人数；领导全国武装力量的一般建设；领导一般对外关系。
    苏联部长会议在管理国民经济之领域中，赋有一系列重要职权。它得设法实现国家预算及苏联国民经济计划，巩固信贷与货币事务。
    苏联部长会议统一并指导苏联各部及其所辖的其他机关的全部工作。
    政府各部——是主持国家管理和人民经济各部门的机关。部长是委托与他的这一部门之领导者。他之下设有干事会。他在他的管理部门范围以内颁布命令。
    苏联各部，分为全联盟的及加盟共和国的两种。
    全联盟的部，掌理那具有全联盟意义的而需要设立一个全联盟中心来管理它们的国民经济各部门。苏联宪法规定这些部门为煤、石油、电力、金属、机器、化学产品等工业部门；国家武装；其他某些工业部门；交通；邮电；对外贸易。
    联盟共和国的部，掌理有全联盟意义的国民经济和国家行政各部门，对这些部门的领导，可以经过加盟共和国的同一名称的各部。全联盟中央机关经过加盟共和国部体系对一定国民经济部门或国家行政部门的领导，配合以加盟共和国相同各部门对这个部门之直接领导。苏联宪法规定，这些部门为食品工业、纺织工业、森林工业，农业和其他某些部门，以及贸易。
    苏联宪法规定，加盟共和国各部也管理国家武装力量、对外关系、国家安全、国家检查、财政、保健以及其他。
    苏联部长会议，有权废除苏联各部长的命令和训令，并有权停止各加盟共和国部长会议关于由宪法划归苏联管理的那些行政和经济部门之决定和指令。
    因此，苏联部长会议，是苏联国家政权之最高执行机关和号令机关，它向苏联最高苏维埃负责，并向苏联最高苏维埃主席团报告工作。
