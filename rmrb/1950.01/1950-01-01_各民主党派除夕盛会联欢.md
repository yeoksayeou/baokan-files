Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 31st: The various democratic parties of China held a grand New Year's Eve celebration at Huairentang at 7 o'clock tonight. Responsible persons from various ministries of the Central People's Government and leading figures from various democratic parties attended. At the meeting, Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, delivered the opening speech. Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, Li Jishen, and Huang Yanpei, Vice Premier of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, delivered speeches successively.

In his opening speech, Vice Chairman Shen Junru pointed out that 1949 was the greatest year in China. In this year, the Chinese mainland was liberated, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was convened, the People's Republic of China was established, the Central People's Government was elected, and people's representative conferences from all walks of life were held in many parts of the country, laying a solid foundation for the people's democratic dictatorship from the central to the local levels. In 1950, we will surely achieve even greater victories, not only finally overthrowing the domestic oppressors, but also striving to defend world peace.

In his speech, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out that 1949 was the year of the greatest victory for the Chinese people, but also the year of the greatest difficulties. He called on all democratic parties, governments at all levels, and all the people to work together in the coming year of 1950 to continue to overcome the various difficulties left over by the war, complete the victory, and consolidate the victory.

In his speech, Vice Chairman Li Jishen explained that New Year's Eve means getting rid of the old and bringing in the new. In 1949, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people summarized the old accounts of China's past history and opened up a new era. He explained that even if there are some difficulties next year, they can certainly be overcome.

Finally, Vice Premier Huang Yanpei recited a new poem entitled "New Year's Eve in 1949".

After the speeches, entertainment programs followed immediately. The party did not end until after twelve o'clock.

    各民主党派除夕盛会联欢
    【新华社北京三十一日电】中国各民主党派于今晚七时在怀仁堂举行盛大的除夕联欢会。中央人民政府各部负责人和各民主党派的领导人物均出席参加。会上由中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席、中国民主同盟副主席沈钧儒致开会词，中央人民政府副主席刘少奇、李济深，中央人民政府政务院副总理黄炎培相继发表演说。
    沈钧儒副主席在开会词中指出：一九四九年在中国是最伟大的一年。这一年中解放了中国大陆，召开了中国人民政治协商会议，成立了中华人民共和国，选举了中央人民政府，在全国许多地方召开了各界人民代表会议，从中央到地方奠定了人民民主专政的巩固基础。一九五零年一定能得到更大的胜利，不仅能最后打倒国内压迫者，而且要为保卫世界和平而努力。
    刘少奇副主席讲话中指出一九四九年是中国人民胜利最大的一年，但也是困难最大的一年。他号召各民主党派，各级人民政府，全体人民在即将来临的一九五零年内，一致努力，继续克服战争所遗留下来的各种困难，完成胜利，巩固胜利。
    李济深副主席讲演中说明除夕为除旧布新之义，一九四九年中国人民在中国共产党领导下总结了过去中国历史的旧账，开辟了一个新时代。他说明年纵有若干困难，但一定可以克服。
    黄炎培副总理最后朗诵了以《一九四九年的除夕》为题的一首新诗。
    讲演结束后，继即进行娱乐节目。联欢会至十二时后始尽欢而散。
