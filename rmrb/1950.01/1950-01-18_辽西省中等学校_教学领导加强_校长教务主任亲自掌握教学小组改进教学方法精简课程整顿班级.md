    Liaoxi Province Secondary Schools
    Strengthen Teaching Leadership
    Principals and Heads of Teaching Personally Oversee Teaching Groups, Improve Teaching Methods, Streamline Curriculum, Rectify Classes
    [From Our Own Correspondent] Since October of last year, secondary schools in Liaoxi Province have strengthened their teaching leadership, appropriately streamlined the curriculum, and rectified student classes. Teaching methods have seen preliminary improvements, and students' learning outcomes have also improved. Generally, school leaders have placed importance on teaching work. Some principals and heads of teaching are personally overseeing the teaching groups of various subjects, listening to lessons with planning and preparation, and exchanging opinions with teachers to improve teaching methods. Kaiyuan Middle School has formed teaching inspection groups for each subject, drawing experienced teachers to assist the principal in checking the teaching materials, reference materials, and teaching outlines of teachers in each subject, as well as checking students' notes and assignments. These measures have helped and promoted both teachers and students. Teachers have generally implemented observational teaching, with at least one observation per subject per week. Teachers with better observational teaching practices provide mutual feedback to improve teaching. Practical teaching has been valued by all schools. In addition to enriching laboratories and specimen rooms, collecting scattered instruments outside the schools, and gathering specimens, some schools are also planning to open small zoos and botanical gardens. A mathematics teacher at Siping Middle School created twenty-nine kinds of teaching aids. Xingcheng Agricultural Vocational School exhibited crops, specimens, etc., and contacted farmers to exchange opinions on agricultural management and variety improvement.
    With the approval of the Education Department, various schools have appropriately streamlined the lesson time and textbook content. Lesson hours for junior high schools have been reduced from a maximum of thirty-four hours per week to twenty-eight or thirty hours; for senior high schools, from a maximum of thirty-six hours to thirty or thirty-two hours. Textbook content has also been appropriately compressed, and the weighting of courses in each semester has been appropriately adjusted. Courses that are repetitive between junior and senior high schools have been deleted. Many schools have also rectified student classes, and students with excessively low levels have been appropriately demoted. Taian Middle School has also separately established remedial classes to help students focus on making up for their schoolwork.
    Due to the reduction in lesson time, the streamlining of meetings, and attention to the rational allocation of time, teachers have more ample time to prepare lessons and grade assignments. They have also strengthened the connection between subject teachers and grade teachers and established a class representative system to closely link teachers and students in teaching. The atmosphere of learning among students has also gradually become stronger.
    However, some shortcomings still exist in some schools: mainly, the leadership has not been thorough enough in guiding teachers on the issue of improving teaching. Teaching groups and class representatives are still just formalities; the streamlining of teaching materials has not started from the perspective of improving teaching quality and maintaining the integrity of the teaching materials, but has simply been a deletion and fragmentation aimed at saving effort and labor, which has reduced the level of teaching. When rectifying classes, mobilization was insufficient, and the follow-up work after rectification was not given enough attention, causing some demoted students to become negative and pessimistic, and some even transferred or dropped out. Some schools have also seen the phenomenon of "rote learning" emerge, and even disbanded student recreational activities organizations, reducing the time for necessary collective activities. These shortcomings remain to be overcome.

    辽西省中等学校
    教学领导加强
    校长教务主任亲自掌握教学小组改进教学方法精简课程整顿班级
    【本报讯】辽西省中等学校自去年十月以来，加强了教学领导，适当精简课程，整顿学生班级，教学方法已有初步改进，学生学习效果亦提高。各校领导上一般都重视了教学工作，有的校长和教导主任分别掌握各科教学小组，并有计划、有准备的听课，和教员交换意见，改进教学方法。开原中学组成了各科教学检查组，抽出有教学经验的教员协助校长检查各科教员的教材、参考材料、教学提纲；检查学生的笔记、作业，这些对教员和学生都起了帮助和推动作用。教员普遍实行了观摩教学，每科每周最少有一次，观摩教学较好的教员，互提意见，改进教学。实物教学已为各校所重视，除充实试验室、标本室，征集散在校外的仪器，采集标本等之外，有的学校并计划开辟小型动物园、植物园。四平中学一位数学教员创造了二十九种教学用具。兴城农科职业学校展览了农作物、标本等，并与农民联系，交换经营农业和改进品种的意见。
    各校对授课时间及教材内容，经教育厅同意后已适当精简。初中授课时数由每周最多三十四小时减到二十八或三十小时；高中由最多三十六小时减至三十或三十二小时。教材内容亦有适当压缩，各学期轻重课程作了适当调整，初高中重复的课程予以删节。很多学校并整顿了学生班级，程度过低的适当降级。台安中学还单独成立了补习班，帮助学生重点补习功课。
    由于授课时间减少，精简了会议，注意了合理支配时间，教员准备课程、批改作业，都有了较充裕的时间，并加强了科任与级任的联系，建立了课代表制，密切师生教学上的联系。学生的学习空气亦渐浓厚。
    但一部分学校里，目前还存在着一些缺点：主要是领导上对教员在改进教学问题上工作不够深入，教学小组、课代表还只是形式；精简教材没有从提高教学质量出发并保持教材的完整性，而单纯地删简割裂，企图省事省力，降低了教学水平；整顿班级时，动员不够，整顿后处理工作不够注意，使有些降级学生消极悲观，有的并转学退学；有的学校又出现了“读死书”的现象，甚至解散学生文娱活动组织，必要的集体活动时间减少。这些缺点尚有待克服。
