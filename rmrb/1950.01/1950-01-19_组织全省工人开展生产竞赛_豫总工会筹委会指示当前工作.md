    [This report from Henan] To further develop the worker movement throughout Henan Province, the Preparatory Committee of the Henan Federation of Trade Unions has recently issued instructions to various regions regarding current trade union work, requiring that all industrial workers in the province be organized by this year's "February 7th" (Second-Seven Tragedy Anniversary). To this end, the guiding ideology must clearly grasp that trade union work should focus on industrial trade unions, while also carrying out handicraft trade union work. The central link in doing this work well is the democratization of management in public factories and enterprises, and the signing of collective labor-management contracts in private factories. In terms of work steps, the instructions require local trade unions to, based on local specific circumstances, after initially carrying out democratic movements and signing collective contracts, shift the focus to conscious and voluntary production competition movements. Public enterprises throughout the province should launch a planned production competition movement around "May Day." The instructions clearly point out regarding the leadership of trade union work: various regions should adopt the method of "demonstrating with typical examples and gradually promoting" to guide overall work. Timely adopt a gradual, wave-like development approach based on specific circumstances, systematically promote typical experiences, educate trade union cadres, and proactively publicize to administrative leaders, workers, and capitalists through worker representative conferences and trade associations to carry out broad mass movements. It is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of cadres doing everything themselves, or only focusing on key handicraft industries in leadership. At the same time, leaders must be good at utilizing worker representative conferences and cultivating worker activists to carry out work.
