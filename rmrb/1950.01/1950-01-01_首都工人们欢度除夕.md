Capital Workers Celebrate New Year's Eve
Shang Kai

New Year's Eve, 1949, red flags fluttered over Beijing, and every household was brightly lit. Workers, students, and citizens celebrated their first New Year after victory with unparalleled revelry and enthusiasm, and in the manner of victors. On the squares of various factories, Yangko drums played cheerful rhythms, and in the clubs, singing teams sang with abandon.

The workers clearly remembered that on this day last year, the People's Liberation Army arrived at the gates of Beijing. Inside and outside the city, the hearts of soldiers and workers, millions of them, merged into one. On the first morning of Beijing's liberation, columns of workers appeared on the streets. The Communist Party returned from the countryside to the city, and met with its class brothers in close friendship. In this short year, Beijing workers met the "May Day" holiday and the Chinese Communist Party's birthday – "July 1st" – with fervent production competitions. On October 1st, the day of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a day of great historical significance, they displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm in workshops, on streets, and in Tiananmen Square, demonstrating their love for their leaders and boundless hope for the new China.

Over the past year, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Beijing's workers have relied on their labor and wisdom to overcome difficulties and restore production, transforming from their past status as slaves to masters of enterprises, shaking off hunger, and beginning to move towards a free and happy life. Zhang Shaode, a blacksmith at the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, described the changes in his life this year with pleasure: "My family of ten has not had enough to eat for thirty years. Now my son and I are working, and we can eat two bags of flour every month. In the autumn, we got a wife for my son." Yang Yinghan, a 25-year-old young fitter, excitedly narrated how he had endured ten years of dark apprenticeship, and only after the Communist Party came did he get promoted to a craftsman. In the staff dormitory, Hu Zhenxi's mother recalled that at this time of year in the past, her son was going to work in thin pants, but this year he put on cotton clothes early.

At the 70th Arsenal, hammerer Lu Mao's mother, who is sixty-six years old this year, told the younger generation in a trembling voice: Twenty-six years ago, in the twelfth lunar month, Lu Mao participated in the Beijing-Hankou Railway workers' strike against the feudal warlords, and was suppressed by Wu Peifu's armed forces. At that time, she witnessed many fellow workers falling in pools of blood in Changxindian. Since then, Beijing's workers have been trampled underfoot, suffering twenty-five years of torment from feudal warlords, Kuomintang bureaucrats, and Japanese imperialism. "Changxindian has become a sad shop, and the Liuli River has become a river of tears." This is the most vivid portrayal of the suffering of workers in the Beijing area. In these long and difficult days, the older generation was tortured to death, and the younger generation turned gray. They endured pain, and hoped for liberation until their eyes were dry, like longing for dawn in a long winter night. They looked at the bright red flag from afar, placing all their hope in the Chinese Communist Party. Turner Deng Yushu still clearly remembers that during his grandfather's days of unemployment, on his deathbed, he repeatedly taught him: "The Communist Party is light, is hope, and the only way to seek liberation is to follow the Communist Party forever." Today, Deng Yushu said: "My grandfather's words were right, and I have taken the right path."

On New Year's Eve in 1949, at the celebration parties in various factories, workers and their families gathered together. When they recalled the suffering of the past, their joyful mood turned to indignation. When they looked at the victory of today, the indignation immediately turned into joy. Everyone cheered for liberation and sang for victory! Everyone sincerely prayed for Chairman Mao's health, for the health of the soldiers at the front, and for the health of all fellow workers! In the cheers, everyone unanimously expressed that they would meet the production tasks of 1950 with a hundredfold enthusiasm and confidence, build the people's capital, and ensure the victory of the motherland's economic construction.

    首都工人们欢度除夕
    商恺
    一九四九年除夕，北京城头上红旗招展，家家户户灯红火亮。工人们和学生市民以无比的狂欢与热情、以胜利者的姿态，来庆祝胜利后的第一个新年。在各工厂的广场上，秧歌锣鼓响着愉快的节奏，俱乐部里，歌咏队在纵情歌唱。
    工人们很清楚的记得：去年今日，解放军到了北京城下。城外城里，战士、工人，千百万颗心溶合到了一起。北京解放的第一个早晨，街头上涌现了工人的行列，共产党由农村回到城市，和自己的阶级弟兄亲密的会晤了。在这短促的一年里，北京工人以火热的生产竞赛迎接了解放后的“五一”节和中国共产党的生日——“七一”，在具有伟大历史意义的十月一日，中华人民共和国诞生的日子里，他们在车间、在街头、在天安门广场发挥了高度的劳动热情，表现了对自己领袖的热爱，对新中国无限的希望。
    一年来，北京的工人在中共北京市委的领导下，依靠自己的劳动和智慧，克服困难，恢复生产，由过去的奴隶地位转变为企业的主人，摆脱了饥饿，开始走向自由幸福的生活。华北农业机械厂的锻工张绍德，他这样愉快的描述了今年生活上的变化：“一家十口，三十年来没有得到过温饱，现在父子两人上了工，每月能吃到两袋面粉，秋天里又给儿子娶了媳妇。”二十五岁的青年钳工杨英汉，兴奋的叙述他如何熬过了十年黑暗的学徒生活，共产党来了才升了工匠。在职工宿舍里，胡振喜的母亲想起了往年这个时候他的儿子正穿着单裤去上工，今年却早早的穿上了棉衣。
    七十兵工厂，锤工路懋的母亲，今年六十六岁了，她用颤抖的语调向年青的人们诉说：二十六年前一个腊月里，路懋参加了反对封建军阀的京汉工人大罢工，遭到吴佩孚武装镇压，当时她在长辛店亲眼看到许多工友倒在血泊里，从此北京的工人被踏到脚下，饱受了封建军阀、国民党官僚和日本帝国主义二十五年的折磨。“长辛店变成伤心店，琉璃河变成流泪河。”这是对北京区工人苦难生活最逼真的写照。在这悠长的苦难日子里，年老的一代被折磨而死，年青的一代又白了头，他们忍受着苦痛，盼解放盼干了眼睛，好像漫长的冬夜盼望着黎明。他们远望着鲜明的红旗，将希望完全寄托给中国共产党。车工邓玉书还很清楚的记得，他祖父在失业的日子里，在临死前的病榻上，曾谆谆教导他：“共产党就是光明，就是希望，求解放只有永远跟着共产党。”今日邓玉书说：“我祖父的话说对了，我的路也走对了。”
    在一九四九年除夕，各厂的庆祝晚会上，工人们，眷属们挤挤一堂，提起往日的苦难，欢笑的心情变为悲愤，看看今天的胜利，悲愤又立刻化为欢笑。大家尽情的为解放而欢呼，为胜利而歌唱！大家衷心地祷祝毛主席健康，祝前方战士健康，祝全体工友们健康！在欢呼声里大家一致表示，要以百倍的热情与信心，迎接一九五○年的生产任务，建设人民的首都，保证祖国经济建设的胜利。
