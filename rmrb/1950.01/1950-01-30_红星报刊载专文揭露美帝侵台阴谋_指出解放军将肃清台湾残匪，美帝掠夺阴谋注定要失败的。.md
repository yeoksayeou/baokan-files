Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 29th, TASS dispatch: The Red Star newspaper today prominently published an article by Krainov, exposing the US military's ambition to turn Taiwan into a military base, stating: When the Kuomintang regime has collapsed and the US imperialist's plundering plan in China has shamefully failed, when the complete and final liberation of all of China from the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek group is nearing its end, the US imperialists are trying to consolidate their position in Taiwan. Under the guise of providing further "aid" to Chiang Kai-shek and his bandits, the US military is trying to preserve this island as their military base. This fact has been proven by the secret agreement concluded between the US government and the Chiang Kai-shek group in November last year.

The author quoted a recent Xinhua News Agency broadcast on the matter, stating: According to this secret agreement, the United States provides the Kuomintang reactionaries with US dollars to purchase arms, and the United States demands to lease Taiwan's military base "as compensation." This in fact means that the US military occupies the island and turns it into a stronghold for US aggressors in the Far East. The most arrogant US imperialists, such as former US President Hoover and Senator Taft, demanded that the US government annex Taiwan as soon as possible. As for General MacArthur, it is said that he has long considered Taiwan to be an integral part of the US Pacific defense system.

The activities of US representatives in various parts of the Far East confirm that the US ruling group is pursuing aggressive goals and exposing this group's conspiracy against the People's Republic of China. The fact that US weapons are constantly being shipped to Taiwan proves the true purpose of the US imperialists. According to the New York Times, the United States has transported more than 250 tanks to Taiwan. According to the British Workers' Daily, 4,000 Japanese naval and air force "specialists" recruited by MacArthur's headquarters have been sent to the island. Since June and July of last year, with the help of the US occupation authorities in Japan, the Japanese "volunteer army" led by former Japanese Army General Nemoto is now concentrating in Taiwan. The repeated visits of the US mission to the island also prove the US ruling group's aggressive plans for Taiwan.

The author concluded: No matter what plans the US imperialists come up with, their conspiracies are inevitably doomed to fail. The situation in China has powerfully pointed out to the US imperialists that when the people unite and are determined to safeguard freedom and independence, US cannons and dollars are of no avail. Undoubtedly, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will eliminate the Kuomintang group in Taiwan, and the island's six million residents will begin a new free life under the five-star red flag of the People's Republic of China.

    红星报刊载专文揭露美帝侵台阴谋
    指出解放军将肃清台湾残匪，美帝掠夺阴谋注定要失败的。
    【新华社北京二十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：红星报今日以显著地位登载克拉伊诺夫的论文，揭露美国军方妄想把台湾变为军事基地的阴谋称：当国民党政权已告崩溃，美帝国主义对中国的掠夺计划已可耻地失败了的时候，当中国全境从蒋介石集团统治下的完全和最后解放正接近结束的时候，美国帝国主义者正力图巩固他们在台湾的地位。美国军方在给予蒋介石及其匪帮以进一步“援助”的掩盖下，力图保全这个岛屿作为他们的军事基地。这一事实已由美国政府与蒋介石集团去年十一月间缔结的秘密协议，加以证明。
    作者引用了新华社最近关于此事的广播称：根据这个秘密协议，美国供给国民党反动派美元用以购买军火，而美国则要求租借台湾军事基地“作为报偿”。这事实上就是意味着美国军队占领该岛，并把它变为美国侵略者在远东的据点。前美国总统胡佛及参议员塔夫脱之流的最狂妄的美帝国主义者，要求美国政府从速地吞并台湾。至于麦克阿瑟将军，据说，他早已认为台湾是美国太平洋防御体系中的一个组成部分。
    美国驻远东各地代表们的活动，证实了美国统治集团追求着侵略目的，并暴露了这个集团反对中华人民共和国的阴谋。美国武器源源运抵台湾的事实，证明美帝国主义者的真正目的。据纽约时报报道，美国已将二百五十余辆坦克运到台湾。据英工人日报消息：麦克阿瑟总部招募的四千名日本海空军“专门人才”已派往该岛。自去年六七月起，由于得到美国驻日占领当局的帮助，前日本陆军将领根本所率领的日本“志愿军”现正在台湾集中。美国使团的多次访问该岛，也证明了美国统治集团对台湾的侵略计划。
    作者最后称：不论美帝国主义者想出什么样的计划，他们的阴谋都不可避免地注定要失败。中国国内的情势，已有力地向美帝国主义者指出：当人民团结起来立志维护自由与独立的时候，美国的大炮与金元是无济于事的。无疑的，中国人民解放军将肃清台湾的国民党集团，而该岛的六百万居民将在中华人民共和国五星红旗下，开始新的自由生活。
