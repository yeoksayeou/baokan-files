North China Middle School Improves Teaching: Teachers and Students Hold Separate Class-Based Forums
Students Widely Offer Opinions on Teaching, Teachers Gain Great Inspiration.

[Our Newspaper News] Beijing's North China Middle School has adopted the method of holding teacher-student forums on a class-by-class basis, extensively exchanging opinions between teachers and students, strengthening teacher-student relationships, and improving teaching methods. By the end of last year, all sixteen classes in the school had held forums successively, with all students and teachers of that class attending, as well as the principal. Before the meeting, the school made full preparations. On the one hand, teachers were made aware that to achieve teaching goals, they must listen to and accept reasonable opinions from students. On the other hand, students were guided in discussions to offer opinions to teachers with a humble and sincere attitude, to achieve teacher-student unity and improve teaching. The forums in each class were conducted based on this principle. Students raised many opinions to the teachers, some of which the teachers had never thought of, which greatly helped the teachers' teaching; some teachers also expressed their opinions at the meeting or announced teaching plans, thereby improving teaching efficiency. The experience of the forums proves that those teachers who can critically accept the advantages of past teaching, absorb progressive and novel teaching materials to teach students; connect theory with practice, have systematic teaching; care about students' learning, and humbly accept students' opinions are all respected by the students. Teachers who explain terms with terms, formulas with formulas; are not serious and not active, are not welcomed by the students. At the forums, students put forward various opinions. For example, students in senior third grade, senior first grade, and junior third grade believed that the geography teacher taught very well because the geography teaching materials could be connected with current practical political issues, making it easier for students to understand and remember deeply; analyze problems with new viewpoints, and point out the nature of the country, so that students can recognize enemies and friends. As for the politics class, junior second grade students said that the teacher can introduce revolutionary stories, which suits the needs of the students and solves many ideological problems for the students. As for the Chinese language teachers, senior first grade students said: the teacher's teaching can arouse students' interest in literature and art, and cultivate students' correct critical views on literature, and can also use facts to explain theories, and the examples are relevant to reality, so that students have the ability to analyze and criticize; senior third grade students said: Teacher Shi borrows many books from outside for students to read, making students embarrassed not to read them. The lecture can be coordinated with politics, and correctly criticized, which is lively and vivid. For students' compositions, they are earnestly urged and corrected, which is very patient. Conversely, such as junior second grade and junior third grade students, requested the English teacher to speed up the progress, and not to tell irrelevant jokes in class; senior third grade students suggested to the analytical geometry teacher: the diagrams should be drawn more clearly, and the problems should be explained step by step, and the example questions calculated on the blackboard should not be erased immediately; senior second grade students expressed their opinions to the physics teacher: give more examples, don't just talk about theory; senior first grade and senior second grade students asked the history teacher to criticize old historical materials and historical figures, so that students can get a correct understanding, and contact more with reality when lecturing; for example, junior second grade students said to the Chinese language teacher that the explanation of vernacular texts should be in depth, and hoped to introduce more extracurricular reading materials, not to miss classes, and often come to guide students.
Since the communication of opinions between teachers and students, many teachers have realized that the demands of current students are fundamentally different from before, and therefore they must strengthen their own research and study, integrate with students, and improve teaching. In addition, some barriers between teachers and students have also been eliminated. For example, a geometry teacher, because he had just arrived at the school and did not understand the students' level, the students could not understand the teaching, and they did not benefit from it; the students had asked the teaching and research department to replace him several times. However, after the exchange of opinions between teachers and students, the teacher humbly accepted the students' opinions and quickly improved the teaching methods, becoming a teacher that the students welcomed very much.

    华北中学改进教学  师生分班举行座谈
    学生对教学广泛提出意见，教员获得很大启示。
    【本报讯】京市华北中学采用以班为单位召开师生座谈会的方式，广泛交换师生意见，密切师生关系，改进教学方法。在去年年底以前，全校十六班已先后召开座谈会，各班学生及担任该班功课的教员全体出席，校长亦参加。会前，学校曾作充分准备工作。一方面使教员认识：要达到教学目的，必须听取与接受学生合理意见。另一方面，则领导学生讨论，以谦和诚恳的态度对教师提意见，以达到师生团结、改进教学之目的。各班座谈会均掌握此原则进行，学生向教师提出了许多意见，有些是教员从来所未想到的，对教员的教课有很大帮助；有的教师亦在会上发表了意见，或宣布教学计划，使教学效率提高。座谈会的经验证明：凡是能批判地接受过去教学的优点、吸取进步的新颖的教材教给学生的；理论联系实际，教学有系统的；关心同学的学习，虚心接受学生意见的，都受到学生的推崇。而以名词解释名词，以公式解释公式；不认真不积极的教师，则为学生所不欢迎。座谈会上，学生分别提出了意见。如高三、高一和初三的学生认为地理教员教课很好，因为地理教材能联系目前实际政治问题，使同学易于了解和深刻记忆；用新观点分析问题，指出国家性质，使同学能认识敌和友。又如对于政治课，初二学生说，先生能介绍革命故事，适合同学需要，为同学解决了不少的思想问题。再如对国文科教师，高一学生表示：先生教书能引起同学对于文艺的兴趣，并培养同学对文学正确批判的观点，又能用事实说明理论，举例切合实际，使同学有分析批评能力；高三学生说：史先生从外面借许多书来给同学看，使同学不好意思不看，讲课能与政治配合，并加以正确批判，生动活泼。对于同学作文，又认真督促和批改，非常耐心。相反的，如初二和初三的学生要求英文教员加速进度，上课时别说无关的笑话；高三的学生向解析几何教师建议：图要画清楚些，要按步骤解释问题，黑板上演算例题，不要立刻擦去；高二学生向物理教师表示意见：要多举实例，不要空谈理论；高一和高二的学生要求历史教师，批判旧历史材料和历史上的人物，以使同学得到正确认识，讲课时多联系实际；又如初二学生对国文教师说，讲解语体文要深入一步，希望多介绍课外读物，别缺课，常来指导同学。
    自师生间意见沟通后，许多教师认识了现在学生的要求已与以前根本不同，因之必须加强自己的研究学习，与学生打成一片改进教学。此外，一些师生间的隔膜也消除了，如有一位教几何的教员，因初到学校，不明了学生程度，教课学生听不懂，得不着益处；学生曾几次要求教导处撤换他。但经过师生交换意见后，这位教员虚心地接受了学生的意见，很快改进教学方法，成了学生很欢迎的教员。
