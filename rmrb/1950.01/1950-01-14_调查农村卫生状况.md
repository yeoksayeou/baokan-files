    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Northeast health work policy, the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government decided to designate Nehe County as a hygiene experiment county. It sent personnel to conduct on-the-spot investigations in Qingfeng Village, Nehe County, and has now formulated a preliminary work plan for the Nehe Hygiene Experiment County. In early December 1949, the Heilongjiang Provincial Health Department sent specialists to Qingfeng Village, Nehe County, to investigate the village's environmental hygiene, birth and death rates, diseases, health, habits, and medical conditions as the basis for formulating a county-wide work plan. The main situations in the village were: (1) Poor environmental hygiene: feces and garbage are everywhere, there are no toilets, wells are not covered, livestock and chicken coops are located next to windows, houses are not adequate, and walls are covered in dust; (2) High infant mortality rate: Eighty-two married women gave birth to a total of 466 children, of whom 266 died, a mortality rate of 57%. Among them, 138 died from postpartum tetanus, accounting for 52% of the total deaths. Forty-three died from measles, fifty-three from enteritis, and twenty-two from unknown causes; (3) Many women's diseases: Among the eighty-two women, fifteen suffered from irregular menstruation, seventeen from back and leg pain, two from osteomalacia and were unable to walk, and three from tetany; (4) Medical conditions: There are only traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and medicine prices are quite expensive. Only old midwives are available for childbirth (the county has four midwives, all in the city); (5) Health status: 99% of the village suffers from trachoma, 9% from chronic bronchitis, and there are various other diseases; (6) In the past two years, there have been outbreaks of typhus, relapsing fever, and Keshan disease, resulting in a large number of deaths; (7) The masses lack health knowledge, and unhygienic practices have become a habit. Based on these conditions, the preliminary work plan for the Nehe Hygiene Experiment County was determined to be: improving environmental hygiene, helping farmers improve toilets and wells, and the construction of livestock pens, gradually renovating houses, beds, stoves, and chimneys, establishing delousing rooms in villages to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases; strengthening farmers' health education, developing hygienic habits such as washing faces, bathing, cutting nails, and airing clothes, carrying out maternal and child health work, reforming 300 old midwives, and implementing universal vaccination; treating trachoma and other chronic diseases. In terms of administrative organization, in addition to establishing county and district health sections and health divisions, each administrative village will have one health committee member, each natural village will have one health worker, and each ten households will have one health team leader. In terms of medical organization, the county hospital will be established according to the standards and equipment of a first-class county, with 50 beds, and will be divided into internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics, pediatrics, and ENT departments; two district hospitals will be established according to the standards and equipment of a third-class county. Rural districts will have twelve health clinics, each with one medical assistant and one midwife or nurse; three maternity stations will be established, and the method of midwife apprenticeship will be implemented to cultivate midwifery personnel; loans will be used to help private hospitals open, and three or four joint hospitals will be organized; a medical cooperative will be established in each district; and the leadership of the existing associations of Chinese and Western medicine will be strengthened. In order to implement this plan, the Provincial Health Department decided to organize a health work team to carry out work in the first and second districts of the county in an organized and planned manner as the starting point for the county-wide work.
