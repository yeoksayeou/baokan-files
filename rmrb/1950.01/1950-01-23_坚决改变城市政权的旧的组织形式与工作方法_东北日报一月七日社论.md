    Resolutely Change the Old Organizational Forms and Working Methods of Urban Power
    Northeast Daily Editorial, January 7th
    In order to adapt to the characteristics of urban concentration, it is necessary to build new organizational forms suitable for urban power and adopt new working methods. The cities of Andong and Jilin have gained relatively mature experience, which can be used as a model for all cities.
    The old district and street organizational forms and working methods make work uncoordinated, neglect industrial production, and separate the municipal government from the masses.
    Before Andong and Jilin changed their old district and street organizational forms and adopted new working methods, like other cities in Northeast China, they carried out the work of restoring and developing production and supporting the war, and achieved certain results. However, because they adopted rural organizational forms and working methods in the city, using the three-level municipal, district, and street governments to carry out work, and taking the street government as the grassroots organization in the city, pushing all work to the street government, the concentrated city was divided into many "tofu blocks." A large number of cadres were entangled in the streets, spending their days in the slums, while large factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools in the city complained every day about "lack of cadres" and did not concentrate on managing them. The cadres working in the districts and streets each did their own thing, making the implementation of policies different in each district or even each street, difficult to unify, and prone to chaos. At the same time, the municipal government was left hanging in the air, lacking direct contact with the people, and the people suffered from overlapping institutions and cumbersome procedures, making it very inconvenient to handle affairs.
    The experience of Andong and Jilin proves that after changing the old district and street organizational forms and concentrating the deployment and implementation of policies, laws, and work tasks in the municipal government, the execution of policies in the city tends to be unified, and the steps are consistent. It also enables the municipal party committee to concentrate its efforts, first focusing on factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools, and on industrial production. The municipal government also directly meets with the masses, overcoming many bureaucratic phenomena of being detached from the masses. For example, in Jilin, in the past, many things were decided by street cadres or residents' group leaders, but now the municipal government solves them directly through the People's Congress or by representatives soliciting the opinions of the people they represent. In the past, it often took two days to complete a household registration transfer, but now it can be done on the spot. In the past, the decisions or instructions of the municipal government took a long time to be transmitted, or were "cut off" midway, but now they can be transmitted to the masses in just three hours. Therefore, after changing the district and street organizational forms, workers at the Jilin Match Factory happily said: "The street government is abolished, and the troubles are reduced!"
    But unfortunately, at present, in Northeast China, there are still very few cities that have relatively completely changed the old organizational forms and working methods of urban power like Andong and Jilin. According to some comrades, the organizational form of urban power, especially the district and street-level power organizations, cannot be changed in any way, otherwise, the city's power will have no "legs" and no "head." Some have also been "preparing" and "transitioning" for half a year, but remain unchanged. Some comrades also say: urban residents are complex, the masses have not been mobilized and organized well, so changes cannot be made; the People's Congress has not been perfected, so changes cannot be made, and so on. Some cities are just changing the soup but not the medicine, changing the district and street governments to district and street offices, merely changing a sign, and everything remains the same as before. Policies are not unified, the strength of cadres is dispersed, the organizations leading and organizing production are quite weak, and municipal-level organs still lack direct contact with the people.
    What causes this?
    Some cities leave the old forms unchanged or just change the sign. Mainly because they don't study the characteristics of the city well, but are accustomed to the old ways.
    Mainly, it is because some comrades working in the city do not study the characteristics of the city well, but are accustomed to the old ways. These comrades worry that changing the district and street organization of urban power will make it difficult for the city level to contact the masses, but they are unwilling to jump out of this rural formula and study how the city's leading organs can directly contact and meet the masses. Therefore, these comrades only think about how to strengthen the district and street power, how to place cadres in the district and street power to realize contact with the people, but they never think about how to improve the city's People's Congress, how to organize the masses in the city first by production and work units (i.e., by factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools), and then by occupation (i.e., by all walks of life), and let the city's organs directly contact them. Therefore, they are always worried that reducing the work powers of the district offices and abolishing the street power will make them lose their "legs" and have no "head." But they do not understand that the city's People's Congress is the most important bridge for the city's People's Government to contact the masses, and that the groups organized by various industries and professions based on their production and occupational units are the foundation of the city's power, its ears, eyes, hands, and feet. They must "grab" these, and if they lose these, the city's power will truly have no "head," lose its "legs," and there will be a danger of being detached from the masses. In some places, they want to strengthen the district and street power and improve the city's People's Congress at the same time, but the result of implementation is that because they are accustomed to working through the old set of district and street power organization forms, they turn the People's Congress into an empty shell, and the various mass organizations organized by production and occupational units cannot be strengthened and lack practical work content. As a result, they still cannot avoid the practice of each doing its own thing, dispersing and dividing, and weakening the connection between the municipal government and the vast number of citizens.
    The experiences of Andong and Jilin have both proven that, in order to adapt to the characteristics of urban concentration, the deployment and implementation of various policies, laws, and work tasks in the city should be concentrated in the municipal government, and the municipal government should contact the masses directly as much as possible, instead of dispersing them to the street governments. Andong and Jilin have both proven that after abolishing the district and street power organizations, concentrating the work in the city, and unifying the daily household registration, public security, and other work in the city's public security bureau and its directly led police stations, all economic, political, cultural, and other work in the city are concentrated in the municipal government, enabling the municipal government's work decisions to be quickly implemented, and strengthening the direct contact between the municipal government and the people. At the same time, because cadres are concentrated for use at the city level and a part is sent to police stations or enterprises to work, their work in public enterprises and public security is stronger than before. They have discovered many problems that were not discovered in the past, and the reflection and transmission of problems between the top and bottom are much faster. The phenomenon of only paying attention to street and slum work in the past has naturally changed.
            Large cities can retain district people's governments; small cities mainly contact the masses directly through the municipal people's congresses and
        people's organizations in various industries.
    Therefore, we suggest that the organizational forms of power in Northeast cities can be changed as necessary, with preparation and leadership, according to the experience of Andong and Jilin, based on two different situations. One is that particularly large cities can retain the district people's government as a level, and before the district people's congress is convened to elect the district people's government, the district office serves as an office agency dispatched by the city level to carry out certain municipal work designated by the municipal government, and to assist the municipal people's government in understanding the situation in each district. At present, we should concentrate our efforts on establishing the municipal people's congress and the municipal-level organs. After the municipal-level organs are relatively sound, we should convene the district people's congress to improve the district's organs, and establish a clear and correct relationship between the district's organs and the city's organs. The street offices or street governments should be abolished, the work of the public security police stations should be strengthened, and good cadres should be filled into the city-level organs or public security police stations, or sent to factories, enterprises, and schools. As for the smaller cities, we can also consider that both the district and street-level power organization forms are not needed, and mainly contact the masses directly through the city's People's Congress and the people's organizations in various industries organized by production and occupation units. Except for the suburbs, which should still retain the power organization of districts and streets (or villages), we believe that all cities in Northeast China can be changed according to the above two situations. Because the existence of street power and the excessive powers of district power not only damage the concentration of the city, hinder the unified handling of all policy-related issues by the municipal government, but also hinder the direct contact between the municipal government and the people. This issue is an important issue in current urban work, because it is not only a issue of power work, but also affects the organizational forms and working methods of urban party and mass organizations, and affects the main direction and focus of urban work. Therefore, it should attract the attention of all localities.
    In addition to the above ideological issues, what difficulties are there in the specific work of changing the urban district and street organizations, and how can these difficulties be resolved?
            The issue of close contact with the masses and the work of public security police stations in specific work
    First, how can the work of urban power closely and directly contact the people? Here, we must first strengthen the city's People's Congress, and in those particularly large cities, we must also strengthen the People's Congresses of each district, and build them into a regular system. At the same time, we must strengthen the work of various industrial trade unions and various trade associations. We should try our best to organize employees of various industries, trades, and occupations into various trade unions, and organize various industrialists and businessmen into various trade associations. Street residents who do not belong to various industries and trades should be organized separately in cooperatives and cultural centers. Women should be organized separately in the above-mentioned various organizations or women's representative meetings. In this way, the people of the city will be organized separately according to their different production and living needs, and the organs of the city and districts will contact the masses through these organizations. In the past, it was impossible to directly contact so many aspects of the masses through the street's all-encompassing organizations. In order to strengthen the connection between the government and the people, between the two People's Congresses, the municipal government will convene representative meetings or symposiums of various industries and trades separately according to work needs to solve problems related to each industry, so as to frequently and closely contact all aspects of the masses, understand the situation, deploy work, and promptly reflect and solve problems.
    The second is the work of the public security police station: We believe that Andong's experience is good. They stipulated that the central task of the public security police station should be mainly public security work, and municipal work should be concentrated in the municipal government as much as possible to strengthen the direct contact between the municipal government and the masses. Under this guideline, they stipulated that the six major tasks of the public security police station are also correct. The municipal government can direct the work of the police station through the public security bureau, and the police station, within its jurisdiction, supervises and ensures the execution of various laws and decrees of the government. For the convenience of work, the public security police station can organize residents' groups or elect street committees that do not separate from production in the area under its jurisdiction as assistants to the work of the public security police station. The public security police stations in each city should, like Andong, report their work to the masses regularly and listen to the opinions of the masses, so that the public security police station truly becomes the people's public security organ. In addition, we should frequently strengthen the civil police education of urban public security personnel, remove some of the remaining bad habits of the old police, and truly become the people's police.

    坚决改变城市政权的旧的组织形式与工作方法
    东北日报一月七日社论
    为了适应城市集中的特点，需要建设适合于城市政权的新的组织形式与采用新的工作方法，安东、吉林两市已经获得了比较成熟的经验，这些经验，可以为各个城市所取法。
    旧的区街组织形式与工作方法使工作不能统一，忽略工业生产，市政府与群众脱离。
    安东、吉林两市在未变更旧的区街组织形式与采用新的工作方法之前，同东北其他城市一样，虽都进行了恢复发展生产与支援战争的工作，并取得了一定的成绩；但由于在城市中采用了农村的组织形式与工作方法，以市、区、街三级政权进行工作，并以街政府为城市中的基层组织，把一切工作推到街政府去作，如是就把集中的城市划成许多“豆腐块”，大量的干部被纠缠于街道，成天在贫民中打圈子；而市内大的工厂企业、机关学校却天天吵着“缺干部”而没有集中注意去管；在区街工作的干部，则各搞一套，使得政策的执行，一个区甚至一个街一个样子，难于统一掌握，混乱时生。同时把市政府吊在空中，与人民群众缺乏直接联系，而人民则苦于机构重叠、手续麻烦，办事深感不便。
    安东、吉林两市的经验证明：改变旧的区街组织形式，把政策法令与工作任务的布置与贯彻执行集中于市政府之后，城市执行政策趋于统一，步调取得一致，并使市委集中精力，首先面向工厂企业和机关学校，面向工业生产，市政府亦与群众直接见面，克服了许多脱离群众的官僚主义现象。如吉林市，过去有许多事情是街干部或居民组长说了就算的，现在则由市政府通过人民代表会议或由代表征询其所代表的人民的意见，由市政府的有关机构直接解决；过去办一个户口迁移手续，往往需要两天，现在则可随到随办；过去市政府的决定或指示，好久传达不下去，或在中途“腰斩”了，现在只要三小时就可传达到群众中去。因之，吉林市在改变区街组织形式之后，火柴厂工人高兴地说：“街政府取消，麻烦减少了！”
    但很可惜，目前东北的各个城市，像安东、吉林两市这样比较完善地改变了城市政权旧的组织形式与工作方法的，仍然很少。据一些同志的意见：城市政权的组织形式，尤其是区街两级政权组织，不能作任何变更，否则市的政权就没有了“腿”，就没有“抓头”。也有的“准备”与“过渡”了半年，依然原封不动。也有同志说：城市居民复杂，群众没有发动好与组织好，不能变更；人民代表会没有健全起来，不能变更等等。有的城市则换汤不换药，把区街政府改为区街公所，仅仅换了一个牌子，一切仍是老样子。政策不统一，干部力量分散，领导与组织生产的机构相当弱，市级机关与人民群众依然缺乏直接联系。
    这是由何产生的呢？
    有的城市对旧形式原封不动或换个牌子。主要由于不去很好地研究城市特点，而习惯于老一套的办法。
    主要地是由于某些在城市中工作的同志，不很好地研究城市的特点，而习惯于老一套的办法。这些同志耽心改变了城市政权的区街组织，市级如何同群众联系，但却不肯跳出这个农村的公式，而去研究一下市的领导机关如何去同群众直接联系，直接见面。因而这些同志只是去想如何加强区街政权，如何把干部摆在区街政权中去实现与人民的联系，却始终不去想如何改进城市的人民代表会议，如何把城市中的群众首先按生产和工作单位（即按工厂、企业、机关、学校）组织起来，其次按职业（即按各行各业）组织起来，由市的机关去同他们直接联系。因之他们天天耽心着：缩小了区公所的工作职权与取消了街政权，他们会失去了“腿”，会没有了“抓头”；而却不懂得，城市的人民代表会就是城市人民政府联系群众最重要的桥梁，而各行各业按其生产与职业为单位所组织的团体，就是城市政权的基础，就是它的耳目与手足，就要“抓”着这些，而如果失掉了这些，城市的政权才真正没有“抓头”，失掉了“腿”，才有脱离群众的危险。也有的地方，想把加强区街政权与改进城市的人民代表会议同时进行，但实行的结果，因为习惯于经过旧的一套区街政权的组织形式去进行工作，因而把人民代表会变成空架子，而按生产与职业为单位组织起来的各种群众组织，也不能加强与缺乏实际工作内容，其结果仍不能避免各自为政、分散割裂的做法，减弱市政府与广大市民的联系。
    安东、吉林两市的经验都证明：为了适应城市集中的特点，城市中的各项政策、法令与工作任务的布置与贯彻执行，均应集中于市政府，尽可能地由市政府与群众直接联系，而不应分散至各街政府。安东、吉林两市均证明他们在取消区街政权组织把工作集中于市，以及日常户政、治安等工作统一于市的公安局及其直接领导的派出所之后，城市中的一切经济、政治、文化等项工作均集中于市政府，使市政府的一切工作决定能迅速贯彻实施，加强了市政府与人民群众的直接联系；同时由于把干部集中使用于市级与一部分派至派出所或企业中去工作，因之他们在公营企业的工作与公安工作均比以前加强了，发现了许多过去没有发现的问题，上下之间，反映与传达问题也快的多了，过去那种只注意做街道与贫民工作的现象，也就自然改变了。
            大城市可以保留区人民政府；小城市主要经过市人民代表会议和
        各行业人民团体直接联系群众。
    因之，我们建议：东北城市的政权组织形式可按两种不同的情况，根据安东、吉林的经验，有准备有领导地进行必要的改变。一种是那些特别大的城市，可以保留区人民政府作为一级，而在目前尚未召开区的人民代表大会选举区人民政府以前，以区公所作为市一级派出的办事机关，执行市政府所指定的某些市政工作，并协助市人民政府了解各区情况。目前应集中力量建立市人民代表会议及市一级机构。待市一级机构相当健全以后，即应召开区人民代表会议，健全区的机构，并使区的机构与市的机构建立清楚的正确的关系。而街公所或街政府，则应取消，加强公安派出所的工作，把好的干部充实到市一级机构或公安派出所或派到工厂企业和学校中去。至于那些较小的城市，还可考虑区街两级政权组织形式均不要，主要经过市的人民代表会议与按生产与职业单位而组织的各行各业的人民团体去直接联系群众，除了郊区仍应保留区街（或村）的政权组织外，我们认为东北的一切城市，均可按以上两种情况进行改变。因为街政权的存在与区政权的职权过大，不仅破坏城市的集中性，妨碍一切带政策性的问题统一由市政府处理，而且也妨碍市政府与人民群众的直接联系。这个问题是目前城市工作中的一个重要问题，因为它不仅是政权工作的问题，而且影响到城市党与群众团体的组织形式与工作方法问题，影响到城市工作的主要方向与重点所在问题，因之应该引起各地注意。
    关于城市区街组织的改变，除上述思想问题之外，在具体工作中还有那些困难，这些困难如何解决呢？
            具体工作中的密切联系群众与公安派出所工作问题
    首先，城市的政权工作如何密切与人民群众的直接联系？这里首先要加强城市的人民代表会议，在那些特别大的城市还要加强各区的人民代表会议，将它建设成为经常的制度。同时加强各种产业行业与职业工会以及各种同业公会的工作。尽量把各种不同产业、行业、职业的职工，组织到各种工会中去，把各种不同的工商业者组织到各种同业公会中去，不属于各行各业的街道居民，则分别组织在合作社、文化馆中，妇女应分别组织到上述各种组织或妇女代表会中，这样就将城市的人民群众，按其不同的生产与生活的需要分别组织起来了，市与区的机关，就通过这些组织联系群众。而过去通过街的一揽子的组织是无法直接联系这样多方面的群众的。为了加强政府与人民的联系，在两次人民代表会议之间，市政府则按工作需要分别召开各行各业的代表会或座谈会，解决有关各该行业的问题，以便经常密切联系各方面的群众，了解情况，布置工作，并及时反映问题与解决问题。
    其次是公安派出所的工作问题：我们认为安东的经验是好的，他们规定了公安派出所的中心任务以治安工作为主，市政工作尽量集中于市政府，以加强市政府与群众的直接联系。在此方针下，他们规定了公安派出所的六大任务也是正确的。市政府可以通过公安局去指挥派出所的工作，由派出所在所管范围内，督促与保证政府各种法令的执行。公安派出所为了工作的便利，可组织居民小组或由该管区内的居民选举不脱离生产的街道委员会，作为公安派出所工作的助手。各市的公安派出所应该像安东市那样，定期向群众报告工作，听取群众的意见。使公安派出所，真正成为人民的公安机关。此外并经常加强对城市的公安人员进行民警教育，去掉某些旧警察的残余恶习，真正成为人民的警察。
