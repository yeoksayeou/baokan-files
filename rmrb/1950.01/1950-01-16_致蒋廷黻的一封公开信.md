    An Open Letter to Jiang Tingfu
    Jiang Jinan
    I want to declare in this letter that, from today onwards, I have decided to formally sever our relationship as uncle and nephew!
    From the time I started reading in elementary school until junior high school, I always thought that Chiang Kai-shek was resisting Japan. This was because I was deceived by the hypocritical propaganda of the Kuomintang reactionary government. I am Chinese, especially a young man, and I support anyone who resists Japan. Therefore, at that time, I still had some hope for the Kuomintang reactionary government and Chiang Kai-shek. In 1944, the Japanese invaders invaded Western Hunan, and we had to flee. On the highway, we encountered the disintegrating Fourth Army, which randomly shot and killed ordinary people, causing everyone to flee from the highway for more than ten miles. I was unfortunately "captured" by the Fourth Army. Later, I learned that they were retreating from Changsha. Without firing a shot, they abandoned their weapons and fled, plundering along the way and shooting anyone who resisted. The people of Changsha, Xiangtan, Yongfeng, and other places will not forget this. I personally saw many ordinary people who did not die on the battlefield but died at the hands of the Kuomintang army. From then on, I knew that the Kuomintang would massacre the people and would not resist Japan. Later, when I entered high school, I also learned that the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek lost the Northeast by "not allowing resistance" and were preparing to lose North China, but were "actively suppressing the Communists." I also learned what the Xi'an Incident was all about. Chiang Kai-shek did not want to resist Japan, but the people of the whole country did; later resistance was also a last resort. From then on, I knew that the Eighth Route Army's arduous resistance gave me confidence that the Kuomintang would definitely fail, and the Communist Party would definitely win. After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I saw the Kuomintang tearing up the Old Political Consultative Conference resolution with one hand. In 1947, I participated in the "May 20th" student movement, and many patriotic students were shot and killed. In Hankou, the Kuomintang used dumdum bullets, which are banned worldwide, to kill students. All of these forced me to strengthen my determination to eliminate the Kuomintang. Later, the Kuomintang destroyed education, and I sympathized with the national students' movement against hunger, persecution, and civil war. Finally, I resolutely came to Beijing.
    You have deceived me a lot. The year before last, when I was in Changsha, I wrote to you asking, "Why has the Kuomintang made China so bad?" You said, "This is not the fault of one person or one party, but because the Chinese people are too poor, it is the fault accumulated by our ancestors for thousands of years." These poisons once caused some fluctuations in my thinking, but you blamed me: "Young people should not just complain!" I asked you, the Kuomintang has made China so bad, how can I not complain? Later, when you were in Shanghai, you said to me: "There is no real freedom in the Soviet Union, and the lives of workers are quite hard, not much different from the Chinese, not even as good as the cattle and horses in the United States. During my tenure as ambassador, people often followed me, and there was no freedom at all! You young people should not only listen to one side of the propaganda. The reason why the Political Consultative Conference failed was not because the Kuomintang sabotaged it, but because the Communist Party did not want peace and unity, and the Communist Party hoped to create a North-South dynasty with the Yellow River as the boundary. Negotiations will not succeed and cannot be negotiated. I know Chiang (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) the most clearly, he doesn't have much ability, if I were the chairman, I would at least be better than him. But in any case, I will support Chiang to the end!" You also took out an American textbook for junior high school students to show me, saying that "Americans are much more advanced than Chinese!" You hope I will become a foreign slave. Yuan Shikai was a traitor, everyone knows that, but you said: "Yuan Shikai accepted the Twenty-One Demands because he did not want to solve the China problem by force, he had no choice but to do so. Yuan Shikai had his own difficulties." You not only exonerated the Kuomintang but also put the blame on the people. You said, "China has never had as many people as it does now, and if we don't control births, this problem will be difficult to solve!" You not only deceived me, but you also deceived my sister and many others!
    In your life, you have published many reactionary statements and done many traitorous deeds. In the United States, you and Marshall jointly made absurd remarks in a certain place, saying that "Communism is not suitable for China, the Chinese people do not want Communism, and the Chinese Communist Party will not succeed," etc. Now the facts have refuted your fallacies. You were involved in the Kuomintang's sale of sovereignty and the signing of unequal treaties with the United States, such as the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty." In the negotiations on American aid to the Kuomintang's military supplies, which one didn't have you? From the United States to Paris, from Paris to the United States, you always represented the Kuomintang in asking the American masters for military supplies. During your tenure in the Relief Administration, the "Civil Aviation Team" presided over by Chennault not only infringed upon Chinese sovereignty but also had no "civilian" purpose at all. In addition to transporting military supplies, it bombed residents of the Liberated Areas. Can this be denied? You used the excuse of transporting relief supplies to open up inland waterway transportation, allowing British and American warships and ships to enter the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, which was opposed by the national shipping industry, do you remember? In the United Nations organization, you have always relied on the breath of American imperialism, opposing the Soviet Union and the people of all countries. Once the United States demanded the abolition of the veto power, attempting to oppress the Soviet Union with "majority," and you also echoed.
    You are good at speculation, and you can deal with all factions within the Kuomintang. Do you remember the major corruption case of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration? Big and small corrupt officials from top to bottom all got a lot of money. The people will not forget this muddled account. The two deputy directors were vying for power. The deputy director of the Political Science Department, Huo Baoshu, had no power, while the deputy director you brought had power. He was corrupt, and the matter became very big. The pseudo-Shanghai District Court sent people to investigate at your residence at 570 Jianguo West Road. When the pseudo-Supervisory Yuan sent people to investigate, the deputy director Li Zhuomin, whom you brought, immediately called the workers and asked them to hide. You can hide it from other people, but you can't hide it from me. The Relief Administration had many shady secrets, such as giving people cars, and a large number of refrigerators were taken to Song Ziwen's private residence. As for the relief supplies, the good ones were sold and eaten. Part of the bad ones was thrown into the sea (even the ones thrown into the sea were good, and someone later complained), and part of it was given to the ordinary people. When you went to Hunan, Yu Jichuan (director of the Hunan branch) prepared for a long time to "welcome" you, spending 20 million (equivalent to the price of ten new large trucks at the time). Corruption cases were everywhere in the Kuomintang government, and the Relief Administration was the worst, even Americans were involved. Even small officials had a large house and a car. Look at how many cars were parked at 120 Fuzhou Road? The house at 570 Jianguo West Road was Wang Jingwei's "mansion," and you took it over and greatly renovated it. There were often only six or seven people living there, but there were more than twenty workers. When a car called, the workers would come out in droves to line up to greet them! Playing cards, watching movies, and dancing became the work of these people. Speaking of this accusation, Wu Dingchang's followers from the Political Science Department wanted to take back the Relief Administration. The pseudo-Executive Yuan had already ordered the dismissal, and imprisonment was imminent, but you telegraphed Zhang Qun, asking him to personally come back to deal with this issue. As a result, Li Zhuomin was acquitted, harming some small minions! You colluded with Zhang Qun to handle it this way. You harmed Huo Baoshu by teaching his subordinates to change fake accounts into real accounts, and the worldwide corruption case was over!
    You snatched the wife of your subordinate (Shen Weitai, director of the editorial department), which was related to this corruption case. Li Zhuomin wanted real power, and you were extremely bored, so he catered to your preferences and introduced Shen's wife to play cards and dance with you. They became cohabiting partners and eventually divorced Shen Weitai. Li Zhuomin brought her into 570 Jianguo West Road. Shen Weitai was then transferred and "promoted" to the United States by you! Li Zhuomin gained real power and joined forces with Duanmu Kai, Zhao Minheng, and others to force your wife, Tang Yurui, to divorce you. It didn't succeed. Later, in the United States, Zhang Pingqun was asked to handle this matter, persuading Tang Yurui to divorce you. The scandal spread from Shanghai to New York, and from New York to Mexico! Finally, you said that the Mexican court granted the divorce. After arriving in the United States, you used your American chauffeur to bully Tang Yurui. Later, when you went to Paris, to attend meetings, or to attend meetings in New York, you and "Miss Shen" (Shen Weitai's wife, also surnamed Shen) appeared together on diplomatic occasions!
    Finally, when you left Shanghai, you deceived me once more, hoping that I would not oppose the Kuomintang and just study books. You said, "You should study hard in the future, don't participate in activities, don't be in meetings all day long, and don't show off!" You hoped that I would not come to Beijing, you hoped that I would enter a university without student movements, you hoped that I would become a prematurely aged person who doesn't care about politics. You said, "There is no fun in doing politics." But you were enjoying it! To be honest, I am not doing your kind of politics; I am doing revolutionary politics, precisely to overthrow your counter-revolutionary politics. Therefore, I cannot but sever my relationship with you as uncle and nephew.

    致蒋廷黻的一封公开信
    蒋济南
    我要在这封信里声明的，就是从今天起，决定与你正式脱离伯侄关系！
    在小学开始读书起到初中，我一直以为蒋介石在抗日，这是因为受了国民党反动政府虚伪宣传的欺骗。我是一个中国人，尤其是一个青年，凡是抗日的人我都拥护，因此在当时我还对国民党反动政府及蒋介石存了一些希望。三十三年，日寇侵犯湘西，我们只好逃难。走到公路上，碰到溃不成军的第四军，随便枪杀老百姓，使得公路旁边十余里人都跑光，我不幸也成了第四军的“俘虏”。后来才知道他们是由长沙退下来的，一枪不发，丢了武器便逃命，沿途实行抢光，凡是反抗的便遭枪杀。这是长沙湘潭永丰等地人民是不会忘记的。我亲眼看见许多老百姓没有死在战场上，却死在国民党军队的手里。从此我知道国民党会屠杀人民外，是不会抗日。以后入了高中，我又知道国民党及蒋介石以“不准抵抗”丢了东北，又准备丢华北，但是却“积极剿共”。我又知道西安事变是一回什么事。蒋介石不要抗日，但全国人民要；后来的抗日也是迫不得已而为的。从此我知道有八路军的坚苦抗日，使我相信国民党一定要败，共产党一定要胜利。抗日战争结束以后，我又看到了国民党一手撕毁了旧政协决定，一九四七年我参加了“五、二○”的学生运动，许多爱国学生被枪杀了。在汉口，国民党用世界禁用的达姆弹打死学生。这些，都迫使了我加强消灭国民党的决心。以后国民党摧毁教育，我同情全国学生的反饥饿、反迫害、反内战的运动。最后我坚决来到了北京。
    你是欺骗我不少的。前年我在长沙，写信问你：“国民党为什么将中国弄得这样糟？”你说：“这不是某一人或某一党的错，而是因为中国人太穷了，是祖先数千年积下来的错。”这些毒素曾使我的思想起了一些波动，而你却责备我：“青年人不要只管发牢骚！”我问你，国民党将中国弄得这样糟，我怎么不发牢骚。后来到上海，你向我说：“苏联没有真正的自由，工人生活相当苦，与中国人不相上下，连美国的牛马也不如。我在大使任内，时常有人跟我走，毫无自由可言！你们年青人不要只听一方面的宣传。为什么政协失败，并不是国民党破坏的，而是共产党不要和平与统一，共产党希望造成以黄河为界的南北朝。和谈是不会成功的，而且不能和谈。蒋（指蒋介石）我知道最清楚，没有多大能力，如果我作主席，至少比他要高明。但无论如何，我要支持蒋到底！”你又拿了一本美国初中用的课本给我看，说什么“美国人的程度比中国人高多了！”你希望我变成一个洋奴。袁世凯是一个卖国大盗，是人皆知，你却说：“袁世凯接受廿一条，是不希望用武力解决中国问题，是不得已而出此。袁世凯是有他的苦衷的。”你不但为国民党开罪，而且将罪加到人民头上。你说：“中国那一代也没有现在的人多，如果不节制生育，这个问题很难解决的！”你不但欺骗了我，你还欺骗了我姐姐以及其他许多人！
    在你一生中，曾发表过不少的反动言论，干过不少的卖国勾当。在美国你曾与马歇尔一起到某地发表荒谬言论，说什么“共产主义不适合于中国，中国人不要共产主义，中国共产党不会成功”等等。现在事实已驳倒了你的谬论。国民党出卖主权与美国订立的不平等条约，如“中美商约”等，都有你的份。美帝援助国民党军火的谈判中，那次没有你？由美国谈到巴黎，由巴黎到美国，每次你都代表国民党向美国主子要军火。你在救济总署任内，由陈纳德主持的“民用航空队”，不但侵犯中国主权，而且根本没有“民用”，除了运军火外，就是轰炸解放区的居民，这还能否认吗？你借口运救济物资，要开放内河航运，让英、美的军舰、轮船走入长江、珠江，遭到全国航运界的反对，你还记得吗？在联合国机构中，你一直在仰着美帝国主义的鼻息，反对苏联，反对各国人民。有一次美帝要求取消否决权，企图以“多数”压迫苏联，你也附和。
    你是善于投机的，国民党内各派系你都能应付。你记得善后救济总署的大贪污案吗？由上而下的大小贪官都分得了不少，这笔糊涂账人民是不会忘记的。二个副署长争权，政学系的那位副署长霍宝树没有权，而你带去的那位副署长有权。他贪污了，而且事情闹得很大。伪上海地方法院派人到你住的地方建国西路五七○号去查，伪监察院派人去查时，你带去的那位副署长李卓敏，马上打电话告诉工友，要工友躲起来。你能瞒住别的人，却瞒不住我的。救济总署黑幕重重，如以汽车送人，大批冰箱被宋子文拿到私人公馆去了，救济物资，好的卖了吃了。坏的一部分丢到海里（丢到海里也有好的，后来又有人控诉），以一部分给了老百姓。你到湖南去时，余籍传（湖南分署长）准备了好久，要“欢迎”你，花了二千万（当时相当于十部大新卡车的价）。国民党政府贪污案件处处有，而以救济总署最甚，美国人也在内。芝麻大的官也有一大幢房子，一部汽车。你看看，福州路一百二十号停了多少汽车？建国西路五百七十号房子，是汪精卫的“公馆”，你接过来大加修饰，住的人经常只有六、七人，可是工友却有二十余人之多，汽车一叫，工友们便一哄而出来排队迎接！打牌，看电影，跳舞，成了你们这些人的工作。说到这次控诉，政学系的吴鼎昌之徒本想顺手拿回救济总署。伪行政院已明令撤职了，眼看徒刑已成，可是你打电报给张群，要他亲自回来处理这问题。结果李卓敏宣判无罪，害了一部分小走卒！你与张群勾结，才能这样办理。害得霍宝树教下级职员将假账改成真账，轰动全世界的贪污案便算完结！
    你抢了你下属（编审处长沈维泰）之妻，与这次贪污案有关。李卓敏想拿实权，你又极无聊，他便投你所好，将沈的妻子介绍与你打牌，跳舞，进一步便同居，又进一步便与沈维泰脱离，由李卓敏将她拉进建国西路五七○号。沈维泰则被你调“升”到美国去！李卓敏得了实权，便与端木恺，赵敏恒等合伙，强迫你的妻子唐玉瑞与你离婚。不成功，后来到美国又要张平群来办这事，劝唐玉瑞与你离婚，由上海闹到纽约，由纽约到墨西哥，丑名处处闻！最后你说墨西哥法庭准予离婚。到了美国，你又利用你的美国汽车夫来欺压唐玉瑞，以后到巴黎，开会，或纽美开会，你便与“沈小姐”（沈维泰之妻，也姓沈）双双出现在外交场合之下！
    最后你离开上海，还欺骗了我一次，希望我不反对国民党，读死书。你说：“以后要努力读书，不要参加活动，一天到晚开会，出风头！”你希望我不来北京，你希望我入一个没有学生运动的大学，你希望我成为一个未老先衰不问政治的人。你说：“干政治没有味道。”但是你倒干得津津有味！老实告诉你吧：我是不干你们这种政治的；我要干的是革命的政治，正是为了打倒你们的反革命的政治。因此我不能不和你脱离伯侄关系。
