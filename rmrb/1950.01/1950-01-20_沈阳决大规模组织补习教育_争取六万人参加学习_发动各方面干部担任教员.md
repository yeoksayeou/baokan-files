    【Benbao Dongbei Xun】The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shenyang Municipal Government recently jointly decided to launch a large-scale mass spare-time cultural education movement, requiring "spare-time schools to be popularized throughout the city, with the aim of enrolling 60,000 people for study throughout the year." All primary and secondary schools should establish attached mass spare-time schools (in cooperation with the district propaganda department and cultural center). All municipal organs should establish a mass spare-time school as far as possible, and cadres with higher cultural levels should be mobilized to serve as teachers in nearby spare-time schools. All spare-time schools must begin to be established by the end of February. The guiding principle of spare-time schools is to improve the cultural and political level of the masses, gradually eliminate illiteracy, systematically and step-by-step teach common scientific and production knowledge, and cultivate junior talents for economic construction in the New Democratic country. The decision pointed out: Spare-time schools must be standardized, establish a certain school system, organize classes according to proficiency level, provide graded instruction, and stipulate promotion, examination, and graduation systems. The faculty of spare-time schools will be resolved through various channels. For example, state-owned factories can be staffed by cadres, employees, and workers with higher cultural and technical levels from the factory; those run by various organs can be designated by the organ's branch and administrative leaders, or a "little teacher" system can be adopted, literacy contracts can be established, and the masses can teach each other to create a learning movement. Teachers must be given certain remuneration. In order to unify the leadership of the city's mass spare-time cultural education work, a spare-time education guidance committee will be formed by the main leaders of the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, the Municipal Education Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Agricultural Committee, the Municipal Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, responsible for guiding, supervising, and inspecting the city's spare-time learning work. Branches should be organized in each district and major factory.
