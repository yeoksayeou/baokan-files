Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 22nd: Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, made the following statement regarding the Military Control Commission's recovery of the former American, French, and Dutch barracks land:

    The Beijing Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently decisively recovered the former American, French, and Dutch barracks land in the city and requisitioned the buildings on the land. Prior notice was also issued, detailing the entire affair and outlining solutions for the requisitioned houses. This is a rightful and solemn act to safeguard the interests and sovereignty of the motherland, and the people of the whole country unanimously praise and firmly support it. Because in the capital of any independent country, the so-called "right to station troops" should never be allowed, allowing people to build barracks and facilitate the free entry of foreign troops; otherwise, disputes between countries can occur at any time. What is the point of talking about adhering to international practices and maintaining lasting world peace? The Chinese People's Government, in accordance with the foreign policy of the "Common Program" decided by its People's Political Consultative Conference, must thoroughly abolish all unequal treaties and their corresponding aggressive privileges created by the imperialists in China for a hundred years, and will never condone or tolerate them. The U.S. State Department spokesman's accusation that the Military Control Commission's actions were "an act of infringing on the property of the U.S. Consulate Office" is not only purely untrue and a deliberate sophistry, but also no different from exposing the hideous true face of the imperialists, disregarding good faith and peace, and bound to arouse the anger and protest of the Chinese people. As for the remarks made by the U.S. State Department, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally, and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman John Kee that if the Chinese government were to forcibly implement this decree, they would "withdraw all U.S. official personnel from Communist China," these are even more unreasonable threats. I now solemnly point out that the new China is determined to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and oppose imperialism!

    People in Various Places Declare Safeguarding National Sovereignty

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 22nd: People's organizations and democratic parties across the country unanimously support the Beijing Military Control Commission's order to recover the former American, French, and Dutch barracks land in Beijing. Zhang Weizhen, Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, issued a written statement saying: "All imperialist privileges in China must be abolished, and no threats can scare the Chinese people again." The Northeast Preparatory Committee of the New Democratic Youth League and the Northeast Student Federation jointly declared: "Only the People's Republic of China can truly safeguard its sovereignty and abolish imperialist privileges." Zhao Fuyou, a worker in Shenyang and a creator of new records, recalled how his grandfather's family was displaced due to the invasion of Beijing by the Eight-Nation Alliance fifty years ago. He said: This matter is exactly what we want. The land of our motherland cannot be occupied by imperialists and should be resolutely recovered. Workers in Wuhan are mutually informing and celebrating Beijing's recovery of the former American, French, and Dutch barracks. Pan Shi'an, an old worker from the "February 7th" era, recounted to young workers the suffering of the Chinese people under imperialist aggression and trampling for decades. He said: Only our Central People's Government can recover national sovereignty and make the people's motherland truly move towards independence, prosperity, and strength. Workers in Chongqing expressed indignantly at a current affairs symposium held on the 19th: The fact that imperialists have left barracks on the territory of the new China is an insult to the independent Chinese people. We firmly oppose the U.S. imperialist slander and threats regarding this matter. Chu Tunan, the person in charge of the Southwest Region of the Democratic League, said: The Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates that the People's Government is not bound by any unequal treaties of imperialism, and imperialism is absolutely not allowed to leave barracks on Chinese territory. The Preparatory Committee of the Hangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Youth League, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Democratic League, and the Hangzhou City Spokesperson of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party have all issued written opinions, supporting the patriotic measure taken by the Beijing Military Control Commission. They unanimously pointed out: This is the urgent demand of our people across the country, and no threat or slander from the U.S. imperialists can shake the Chinese people's firm will to defend their sovereignty. In addition, people's organizations in Harbin, Jinzhou, Taiyuan, Changsha, Jinan, Kaifeng, Wuxi, and other places have also spoken out to express their support, and expressed contempt and anger at the sophistry and slander of U.S. imperialism.

    全国各地人民团体民主党派一致表示
    拥护京市收回外国兵营地产
    反对美帝国主义的狡辩诬赖
    民革主席  李济深谈话
    【新华社北京二十二日电】中国国民党革命委员会李主席济深为军管会收回前美、法、荷兵营地产发表谈话如下：
    日前中国人民解放军北京市军管会，断然的收回了市内前美、法、荷兵营地产，并征用其地面上的建筑物。事前又曾发出布告，详述这件事的颠末，并已另订征用房屋之解决办法。这是维护祖国的利益与主权应有之正当而郑重的举动，全国人民都是同声称赞而表示坚决拥护的。因为在任何一个独立国家的首都内绝不容许有所谓“驻兵权”，任人建造兵营，便利外国军队自由进扎；不然的话，则国与国之间争执起衅的事件，随时可以发生，还说什么遵守国际惯例，维持世界持久和平的空话？中国人民政府根据自己人民政治协商会议决议的“共同纲领”的外交政策，对于帝国主义者在中国百年来所制造的一切不平等条约及其随应的侵略特权，必须彻底废除，决不姑息与容忍。乃美国国务院发言人诬指军管会为“侵犯美领事馆办公厅产业的行为”，不但纯非事实，信口狡辩，而且无异把帝国主义者真面目狰狞地全部暴露，不顾信义和平，势必引起中国人民的愤怒与抗议。至于美国国务院和参议院外交委员会主席康纳利和众议院外交委员会主席季约翰等人所讲的倘使中国政府要强制执行这个法令，他们“就要从共产党中国撤退所有美国官方人员”，更是无理威胁之辞。本人现在郑重指出，新中国是决心保障领土主权及反对帝国主义的！
    各地人民宣示维护国家主权
    【新华社北京二十二日电】全国各地人民团体和民主党派一致拥护北京市军管会收回京市前美、法、荷兵营地产的命令。东北总工会主席张维桢发表书面谈话称：“帝国主义一切在华特权必须废除，任何威胁再不能吓住中国人民”。新民主主义青年团东北筹委会、东北学生联合会共同声明说：“唯有中华人民共和国才能真正维护自己主权，废除帝国主义特权。”沈阳市新纪录创造者工人赵富有回忆五十年前他们祖父因八国联军侵入北京而致全家流离失所的情形，他说：这件事正合我们的意思，我们祖国的土地不能给帝国主义者霸占，应该坚决收回。武汉工人们互相转告和庆贺京市收回前美、法、荷兵营。“二七”时代的老工人潘世安，向青年工人叙述几十年来中国人民在帝国主义者侵略和蹂躏下的痛苦，他说：唯有咱中央人民政府，才能收回国家主权，使人民祖国真正走向独立富强。重庆市的工人们在十九日召开的时事座谈会上愤慨地表示：帝国主义在新中国的领土上留设兵营，是对独立的中国人民一种侮辱，我们坚决反对美帝对这件事的诬赖和威胁。民主同盟西南方面负责人楚图南说：人民政协共同纲领中规定人民政府不受任何帝国主义不平等条约的约束，中国领土上绝不准帝国主义留设兵营。杭州市总工会筹委会、市民主妇联筹委会、青年团浙江工委会、市工商联合会筹委会、民盟杭市工委会、农工民主党杭市发言人都纷纷发表书面意见，拥护北京市军管会这一爱国措施，一致指出：这是我全国人民的迫切要求，美帝的任何威胁诬赖，也不能动摇中国人民保卫主权的坚决意志。此外，哈尔滨、锦州、太原、长沙、济南、开封、无锡等地人民团体也都纷纷发言表示拥护，并对美帝国主义的狡辩诬赖，表示卑视和愤怒。
