Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th: Circular of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on the 27th Anniversary of the "February 7th" Strike:

    The 27th anniversary of the "February 7th" Beijing-Hankou Railway Workers' Great Strike, a struggle for the freedom and rights of the Chinese working class and against the oppression of imperialism and warlords, is approaching. Twenty-seven years ago, under the reactionary rule of imperialism and feudal warlords, the Chinese working class not only had no freedom to organize trade unions, but even lacked the right to survive, being completely in a state of slavery subjected to cruel oppression and exploitation. However, in these twenty-seven years of arduous struggle, the Chinese working class, thanks to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the heroic and skillful fighting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the resolute struggle of the broad masses of peasants, and the great unity of the people of the whole country, has won a great victory against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism throughout the country. The Chinese working class has not only won all the democratic rights fought for in the "February 7th" strike, and is no longer subjected to anyone's oppression, but has also become the leading class of the People's Republic of China – the master of the new China! Therefore, this year's commemoration of "February 7th" has a particularly significant meaning, different from any previous year. Trade unions in various places should explain this significance to the broad masses of workers, and at the same time earnestly explain the great responsibility of being the masters of the country. Therefore, at a time when the revolutionary war has not yet ended, the restoration and development of production are urgent, and the state is facing financial difficulties, the working class must play an exemplary leading role of enduring hardship and unite the people of the whole country to help the country overcome difficulties, develop production, and create a happy future for themselves.

            Specific Methods of Commemoration
    Regarding the specific methods for commemorating "February 7th", the following decisions have been made:

    1.  Before the "February 7th" anniversary, trade union organizations in various places should organize various small-scale forums among the workers, especially railway workers and industrial workers, using after-work hours, based on the "February 7th" historical materials released by the Xinhua News Agency, to conduct discussions and discussions, so that the workers can have a deep understanding of the historical facts of "February 7th" and the current situation and tasks.

    2.  According to the decision of the 12th Administrative Meeting of the Government Administration Council on unifying the national holidays and anniversaries, the "February 7th" anniversary will not be a holiday. Therefore, the general trade unions of various cities may organize a commemorative evening party on the evening of the "February 7th" anniversary, mainly with representatives of industrial workers and with representatives of various workers in the city, and the person in charge of the municipal general trade union will make a popular and concise report on the "February 7th" commemoration. In addition, veteran workers who participated in the "February 7th" struggle should be invited to speak at the meeting, as well as free speeches by worker representatives, and there should be some entertainment programs. Railway trade unions and other industrial trade union organizations at all levels, in addition to sending representatives to participate in the commemorative meeting convened by the local municipal general trade union, may also hold mass commemorative meetings of their own units in their spare time.

    3.  The railway trade union organizations in Zhengzhou, Changxindian, and Jiang'an may consult with the railway administration to change Sunday to the "February 7th" anniversary, provided that it does not hinder driving production, so as to hold mass commemorative conferences for railway workers. The methods for holding the meetings shall be specifically agreed upon by the above-mentioned three railway trade union organizations and the local municipal general trade unions.

    中华全国总工会关于纪念“二七”的通知
    【新华社北京二十八日电】中华全国总工会关于“二七”罢工二十七周年纪念的通知：
    为争取中国工人阶级的自由权利、反对帝国主义和军阀压迫的“二七”京汉铁路工人大罢工二十七周年纪念日即将到来了。二十七年以前，中国工人阶级在帝国主义与封建军阀的反动统治下，不仅没有组织工会的自由，而且连生存的权利都没有，完全处在遭受残酷压迫剥削的奴隶地位。然而在这二十七年的残酷斗争中，中国工人阶级由于获得了中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，由于有中国人民解放军的英勇善战，由于有广大农民群众的坚决斗争和全国人民的大团结，已在全国范围内取得了反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义的伟大胜利。中国工人阶级不仅获得了“二七”罢工所争取的一切民主权利，不再受任何人的压迫，而且成了中华人民共和国的领导阶级——新中国的主人翁！因此，这是今年纪念“二七”，与过去任何一年不同的特别重大的意义。各地工会应向广大工人群众解释这个意义，同时要切实说明国家主人翁的重大责任，因此在目前革命战争尚未结束，恢复与发展生产又急不容缓，国家财政困难的时候，工人阶级要以忍苦耐劳的模范带头作用，领导并团结全国人民，帮助国家克服困难，发展生产，创造自己幸福的将来。
            纪念的具体办法
    关于纪念“二七”的具体办法，有下列几项决定：
    一、在“二七”纪念日以前，各地工会组织，应在工人群众中，特别是在铁路工人与产业工人中，根据新华社发布的“二七”史料，利用工余时间，组织各种小型的座谈会，进行座谈与讨论，使工人群众对“二七”的历史事实及目前时局和任务，有深刻的认识。
    二、根据政务院第十二次政务会议关于统一全国年节和纪念日放假办法的决定，“二七”纪念日不放假。因此，各城市总工会可在“二七”纪念日的晚间，组织一个以产业工人代表为主的与有全市各种工人代表参加的纪念晚会，并由市总工会的负责人作一通俗而简明的关于“二七”纪念的报告。此外要约请当地曾经参加过“二七”斗争的老工人在会议上讲话和工人代表的自由发言，并应有一些游艺节目。铁路工会及其他产业工会的各级组织，除应选派代表参加当地市总工会召集之纪念会议外，并可在工余时间，举行自己本单位的群众纪念会议。
    三、郑州、长辛店、江岸三地的铁路工会组织，可向铁路行政商议，在不妨碍行车生产的前提下将星期日改在“二七”纪念日，以便举行铁路工人的群众纪念大会。举行会议的办法，由上述三地铁路工会组织与当地市总工会共同具体商定之。
                                      一九五○年一月二十八日
