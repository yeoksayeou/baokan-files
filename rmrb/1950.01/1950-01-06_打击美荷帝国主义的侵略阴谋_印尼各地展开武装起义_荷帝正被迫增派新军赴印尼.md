Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 5th: Electroneews Agency, Prague, January 4th: The Free Indonesia News Agency issued a statement in Prague stating that the armed uprisings erupting across Indonesia are a clear response to Hatta's betrayal of the Indonesian people to American and Dutch imperialists. In December, anti-Dutch warfare continued in northern Sulawesi, and martial law was implemented in East Java. Even in Surabaya, the puppet army had to help the Dutch suppress demonstrations by people protesting Hatta's surrender to the imperialists. Many plantation guards and puppet army officers and soldiers joined the People's Army. Meanwhile, workers in Batavia, Bandung, and other cities, as well as in southern and eastern Borneo, are conducting strikes demanding political and economic rights. The People's Army is growing stronger, and the Indonesian people are firmly rejecting any so-called "agreements" between the Indonesian puppet ruling clique and the imperialists.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 5th: TASS, The Hague: Local newspapers report that the Dutch government has drafted a plan to send new Dutch troops to Indonesia in 1950. This fact clearly proves the cunning nature of the so-called "transfer" of sovereignty to the "United States of Indonesia." Communist Party member Van Santen spoke in the Dutch parliament, exposing the reactionaries' plan and stating: "With the help of traitors and collaborators Sukarno and Hatta, Dutch and American imperialists want to retain colonial rule in Indonesia. For this purpose, the government plans to send new troops to Indonesia next year." *The People's Daily* wrote: In 1950, the Dutch Navy will, as before, be stationed in Indonesian waters. The number of Dutch naval officers and soldiers currently remaining in Indonesia exceeds five thousand.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 5th: Electroneews Agency, The Hague, January 4th: Dutch authorities revealed that just hours before Indonesia's "independence" took effect, six hundred and thirty Japanese war criminals had sailed from Batavia to Japan. These war criminals include Japanese who have been convicted of brutal murder, including Japanese who buried Dutch, Australian, and other Allied soldiers captured in Java during the war alive. Among these war criminals are ten generals. It is generally expected that all war criminals will be released upon arrival in Japan.

    打击美荷帝国主义的侵略阴谋
    印尼各地展开武装起义
    荷帝正被迫增派新军赴印尼
    【新华社北京五日电】电通社布拉格四日讯：自由印尼通讯机关在布拉格发表声明称：正在印尼各地展开的武装起义，就是对哈达向美、荷帝国主义者出卖印尼人民的明白回答。十二月份内，西里伯斯北部的反荷战事继续在进行，东爪哇已实行戒严。甚至在泗水，傀儡军也不得不帮助荷兰来镇压人民抗议哈达向帝国主义者投降的示威。许多种植园的卫兵及傀儡军官兵，参加了人民军。同时，在巴达维亚、万隆及其他城市以及婆罗洲南部和东部的工人们，也正在进行罢工，要求政治和经济权利。人民军的力量日益强大，印尼人民坚决拒绝印尼傀儡统治集团与帝国主义者之间的任何所谓“协议”。
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社海牙讯：此间报纸载称，荷兰政府已拟出一九五○年派新的荷兰部队去印尼的计划。这件事实再度明白地证明所谓“移交”主权给“印尼合众国”的狡猾性。共产党议员范圣天在荷兰议会中发言，揭露反动派的计划，并称：“荷、美帝国主义者在卖国通敌分子苏加诺与哈达的帮助之下，想在印尼保留殖民统治。为此目的，政府打算在明年派新的部队到印尼”。人民报写道：一九五○年，荷兰海军将像以前一样停泊在印尼的领水中。目前留在印尼的荷兰海军官兵的数目，超过五千人。
    【新华社北京五日电】电通社海牙四日讯：荷兰当局透露：在印尼“独立”生效以前数小时，六百三十名日本战犯已自巴达维亚乘船赴日本。这些战犯中包括已被判决为残暴杀人罪的日本人，包括活埋战时在爪哇被俘的荷兰、澳大利亚及其他盟国士兵的日本人在内。这些战犯中有十名将官。一般预料，所有战犯在到达日本时，都将被释放。
