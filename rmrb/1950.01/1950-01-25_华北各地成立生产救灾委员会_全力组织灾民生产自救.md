Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd. North China's production and disaster relief work has achieved considerable success. However, the disaster situation in many areas is still very serious. Local leading organs are continuing to make every effort to lead and organize disaster victims for production and self-salvation. After severe floods, droughts, insect plagues, hail and other disasters occurred in the summer and autumn of last year in North China, the total affected population reached approximately 13 million, of which Hebei and Pingyuan provinces were the most severely affected, with over 4 million disaster victims in Hebei and 2.5 million in Pingyuan. When serious disasters occurred, the local CCP committees and people's governments immediately called on disaster victims in various regions to fight against the severe famine, and specifically led and organized disaster victims for production and self-salvation. In some areas, due to vigorous organization of disaster victims to carry out production and disaster relief in various ways, and mobilizing non-disaster areas to support disaster areas, the disaster situation has been alleviated. Under the leadership of the People's Government, disaster victims in Hebei Province found more than 60 ways to make a living. Fish farming alone solved the livelihood difficulties of more than 120,000 disaster victims in the Tianjin and Baoding regions. In Shou Zhang County, Pingyuan Province, disaster victims were mobilized and organized to participate in sideline production and contracted grain transportation, enabling 80% of the disaster victims to find ways to make a living. In non-disaster areas of Hebei Province, a "bowl of rice" movement was launched to provide relief to compatriots in disaster areas. According to statistics from 27 counties in the province, more than 2.5 million catties of relief grain were raised, solving the food problem for some disaster victims. Although the above-mentioned great achievements have been made in disaster relief work in various regions, there are serious shortcomings in many areas. For example, in some areas, disaster relief work remains at the level of planning and calls, lacking specific organizational work; the leading organs of some counties only pay attention to leading several major production tasks, and abandon taking various measures to support disaster victims in carrying out production; some even simply divide the production income by the total number of disaster victims, blindly believing that the famine problem has been solved; there are also some areas where cadres do not specifically analyze and calculate the disaster victims' potential production capacity, and help them to carry out production, but only shout about difficulties and ask for relief. For example, the cadres of Dama Village in Baodi County, Hebei Province, reported to the higher authorities that 34 households were in urgent need of relief, but after investigation and analysis, it was found that 30 of them could find ways to make a living with assistance. Due to the above-mentioned serious shortcomings, the disaster relief work has failed to achieve the due results, resulting in the fact that the disaster situation in many areas is still very serious. According to a survey of nine typical villages in four counties of Pingyuan Province, 82% of the disaster victims will run out of food before the Lunar New Year. In Tongxian County, Tianjin, and Baoding three regions in Hebei Province, about one million people will be unable to live before the Lunar New Year. Under this serious disaster situation, various regions will face the spring famine season between the harvest seasons, and the lives of disaster victims will become more difficult. Therefore, disaster relief work has become an urgent task at present. The leading organs in various regions have now reviewed the above-mentioned shortcomings, summarized successful experiences, and successively established production and disaster relief committees to strengthen the leadership of disaster relief work; many county and district cadres have also gone deep into the countryside to specifically check and help disaster victims carry out production and self-salvation.
	According to the experience of Pingyuan and Hebei provinces, accurately calculating the production capacity of disaster victims and organizing disaster victims to carry out production and self-salvation in various ways is the most effective method of disaster relief. For example, the People's Government of Hebei Province led disaster victims to find more than 60 ways to make a living, solving the livelihood and production difficulties of many disaster victims. The experience of various regions also proves that convening representative meetings of various sectors, symposiums of labor heroes, and symposiums of old farmers in disaster areas can pool ideas and find various ways to overcome the famine, and can also enhance the confidence of cadres in leading the fight against the famine. In addition, the production and self-salvation movement in various regions must also be combined with the organizational work of cooperatives and trade departments, and a comprehensive plan and solution must be made for the allocation of food, the use of funds, and sales issues. Only in this way can the disaster relief task be successfully completed.

### 华北各地成立生产救灾委员会  全力组织灾民生产自救

    华北各地成立生产救灾委员会
    全力组织灾民生产自救
    【新华社北京二十二日电】华北区的生产救灾工作已获得不少成绩，但是目前不少地区灾情仍很严重，各地领导机关正继续全力领导和组织灾民进行生产自救。华北区去年夏秋相继发生严重的水、旱、虫、雹等灾后，受灾总人口约达一千三百万，其中河北、平原两省最为严重，河北灾民达四百余万，平原为二百五十余万。当严重灾情发生后，各地中共党委和人民政府即号召各地灾民向严重灾荒进行斗争，并具体领导和组织灾民进行生产自救。在部分地区由于大力组织灾民以多种多样的办法，进行生产救灾，并发动非灾区支援灾区，使灾情业已减轻。河北省的灾民在人民政府的领导下，找出生产门路达六十余种，其中仅治鱼一项，在天津、保定两专区，即曾解决十二万余灾民的生活困难。平原省寿张县发动和组织灾民参加副业生产和包运公粮，使百分之八十的灾民找到了生活的门路。河北省在非灾区发动一碗米运动，救济灾区同胞，据该省二十七个县统计，募集救济粮二百五十余万斤。解决了部分灾民的食粮问题。各地在救灾工作中曾获得了上述巨大成绩，但是不少地区存在着严重缺点。如有些地区将救灾工作停留在计划与号召上，缺乏具体组织工作；某些县份的领导机关只注意领导几种主要的生产工作，而放弃采取多种多样的办法扶植灾民进行生产；有的甚至简单地拿生产所得去除灾民总数，盲目地认为灾荒问题已经解决；也有一些地区干部不具体的分析和计算灾民可能有的生产能力，帮助其进行生产，只是空喊困难，要求救济。如河北宝坻县大马庄村干部向上级报告有三十四户急待救济，但经过调查分析，其中有三十户可以经过帮助即能找到生活门路。由于上述严重缺点，使救灾工作未能收到应有的成效，致使目前有不少地区灾情仍很严重。据平原省四个县九个典型村的调查，旧历年前百分之八十二的灾民将断炊，河北省通县、天津、保定三个专区，旧历年前无法生活者在百万人左右。在此严重灾情下，各地又将面临青黄不接的春荒季节，灾民生活益趋困难，因此，救灾工作已成为目前迫切的紧急任务。现各地领导机关已检讨了上述缺点，总结了成功经验，相继成立生产救灾委员会，加强救灾工作的领导；有许多县区干部并已深入农村，具体检查和帮助灾民进行生产自救。
    根据平原、河北两省的经验证明：精确计算灾民中的生产能力，用多种多样的办法组织灾民进行生产自救，是救灾工作中最有效的方法。如上述河北省人民政府领导灾民找出生产门路达六十多种，解决许多灾民的生活和生产的困难。各地的经验还证明：在灾区召开各界代表会、劳动英雄座谈会、老农座谈会，就可以集思广益，找到多种多样的渡荒办法，也可以增强干部领导渡荒的信心。此外，各地生产自救运动还必须和合作社及贸易部门的组织工作结合起来进行，对粮食的调拨和资金的运用以及销路等问题，做一通盘的筹划和解决，只有这样，才能使救灾任务顺利完成。
