Thirty-two years ago, a new Soviet society gave birth to a new literature.

The writers who personally participated in this great event dedicated their rich experience, their life wisdom, and their ardent desire to serve the people through art to literature. And, over these thirty-two years, the Soviet writers have created a comprehensive and innovative literature.

Soviet writers, as Gorky said, created brilliant works "with the flame of heroic labor enthusiasm blazing in our country." They demonstrated the depth of the Soviet people's thoughts and feelings. In inheriting and developing the excellent traditions of classical literature, and in mastering the invincible method of socialist realism, they steadily elevated art to extremely high levels.

Soviet literature expresses the spirit of the people who created the socialist society. It has become the voice of these new human beings, the communist fighters, and it is permeated with optimism. It exposes the decadence and hypocrisy of the degenerate bourgeoisie's worthless preachings of so-called human weakness and incompetence. For all progressive people, Soviet literature is a literature that inspires everyone to fight for peace and democracy, and to fight against warmongers. The works of outstanding Soviet writers have provided the most valuable contributions to the literature and art of all nations in the world.

New images are constantly improved and emerge endlessly, and Soviet literature is full of vitality. It has become something that the broad masses are concerned about and love. It has gained increasing importance in the spiritual life of the people. The advanced characters it depicts cultivate lofty moral ideals in the hearts of readers and have won unparalleled admiration from Soviet readers.

It is precisely because the Soviet people attach so much importance to their literature that they place higher demands on it.

Criticism applied without reservation or bias, and passionate and sincere exchanges of opinions between authors and readers, are natural phenomena in the literary life within the Soviet Union.

A work, as long as it reveals the slightest distortion of reality, or is clumsy in structure and character depiction, lacks perfect arrangement, has a poor appearance, or has unrefined vocabulary, will provoke fair and severe criticism from all levels of Soviet society.

Criticism and self-criticism are the driving force for the advancement of Soviet literature. Frequent contact between readers, critics, and writers often involves many sharp, closely related aesthetic and ideological issues.

Recently, general attention has been focused on the unpleasant works of two talented and well-known writers: Sofronov's play "Bekhtov's Fame" and Kozhevnikov's play "Shining River." Their attempts to depict the primary issues of the present have failed. The most serious mistake is that they did not give a full exposition of what the fundamental contradiction is; the characters in the play are neither refined, nor do they subject their ideas to the test of life.

A broad discussion of literature and literary criticism that has unfolded recently indicates that Soviet literature has advanced to such a high stage that it has become absolutely impermissible to discuss an artistically immature work in a warm and sentimental way. What Soviet criticism particularly emphasizes is that unless a lofty content is integrated with a high artistic form like flesh and blood, a writer is not qualified to be called an engineer of the human soul.

Soviet society, in its rich and significant aspects of life, is constantly imprinting new and great achievements every day. To convey the grandeur of these achievements and the thoughts and expectations of the Soviet people in an appropriate form is the duty of Soviet writers.

Soviet writers, with realistic and faithful portrayals, with literature enriched by new themes and new characters, have helped the people to grow stronger and move forward.

    在走向新成就的坦途上
    易俗译
    三十二年前，新的苏维埃社会诞生了新的文学。
    曾经亲身参与这伟大事件的作家们给文学献出了他们丰富的经验，他们的生活智识以及他们以艺术为人民服务的热望。并且，在这三十二年的过程中，苏维埃的作家群已经创造了一种包罗万象的革新的文学。
    苏维埃的作家们，如高尔基所说的，“以燎燃在我们国内的英雄般的劳动热忱的火焰”，创造了辉煌的作品。他们展示了苏维埃人民的思想和情操的深度。在继承与发展古典文学的优良传统中，在掌握社会主义现实主义这无往不利的方法中，他们稳步地把艺术提升到极高的水平。
    苏维埃的文学，表现了那创建了社会主义社会的人民的精神。它成为这些新人类，共产主义斗士的喉舌，它浸透着乐天的精神。它给堕落的资产阶级一钱不值的所谓人类懦弱无能的说教揭发其腐朽性和虚伪性。对于一切进步的人，苏维埃文学是一种鼓舞大家为和平与民主而斗争，为反对战争煽动分子而斗争的文学。苏维埃优秀作家的作品，为全世界各民族的文艺，提供了最有价值的贡献。
    新的形象不断的改进和层出不穷的增加，苏维埃文学充霈着活力。它已经成为广大群众所关注的东西和他们所喜爱的对象。它在人民精神生活中获得了与日俱增的重要。它所描写的那些先进的角色，在读者心中育化着崇高的道德理想，博得了来自苏维埃读者方面无比的赞赏。
    正因为苏维埃人民如此重视他们的文学，他们才对它提出更高的要求。
    没有顾忌也没有偏颇的运用着的批评，作者与读者间热情的诚恳的意见交流，这在苏维埃境内的文学生活中，是极自然的现象。
    一件作品，只要它显露了对现实稍有歪曲，或是结构与人物描写拙劣，安排不够完善，表象贫乏，或者词汇不工，将引起来自苏维埃社会各阶层公正的与严峻的批评。
    批评与自我批评是苏维埃文学推进的动力。读者、批评家与作家间频繁的接触，每每包含着许多锋锐的，紧紧关连的美学上的和意识形态上的问题。
    最近，一般的注意汇集在二位富有才能的著名作家的不愉快的作品上：索夫洛诺夫的剧本《别克托夫的功名》和科哲夫尼可夫的剧本《闪耀的河流》。他们所企图描写的当前的首要问题显示得失败。最严重的错误是：对什么是矛盾的根本所在，他们没有给予充分的阐发，剧中人物既不精炼，也没将他们的观念从属于生活的考验。
    最近期间，对文学和文学批评所展开的一次广泛的讨论指明，苏维埃文学已经迈进到这样高的阶段，想温情地讨论一部艺术上欠成熟的作品，已成为绝不容许。苏维埃的批评所特别强调的是：除非崇高的内容与高度的艺术形式血肉般地结合在一道，一个作家没有资格称为人类灵魂的工程师。
    苏维埃社会在其丰富的重大的生活各方面，日日不断地烙印下新的巨大的成就。以恰当的形式来传载这些业绩的宏伟与苏维埃人民的思想和期望，这就是苏维埃作家的职责。
    苏维埃作家，以现实的忠实描绘，以新主题和新人物充实着的文学帮助了人民壮大和前进。
