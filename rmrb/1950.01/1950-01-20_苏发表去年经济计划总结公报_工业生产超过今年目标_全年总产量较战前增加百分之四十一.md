Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th: TASS Moscow, 18th: The Central Statistical Bureau of the Soviet Government has issued a communiqué on the results of the implementation of the State Plan for the Restoration and Development of the Soviet National Economy in 1949. The statistics in the communiqué demonstrate the development of industry, agriculture, and transportation in 1949, the scale of basic construction projects, the amount of trade, and the improvement of the people's material and cultural standards.

	Industry:

In 1949, Soviet industrial output exceeded the already expanded annual plan by 3 percent. The total annual industrial output increased by 20 percent compared to 1948, and by 41 percent compared to the pre-war year of 1940. By the near end of 1949, the total industrial output exceeded the 1950 target set by the Five-Year Plan. According to the Five-Year Plan, in 1950, the total output of all Soviet industries should exceed the pre-war 1940 production by 48 percent. In the fourth quarter of 1949, the average monthly total industrial output exceeded the 1940 level by 53 percent.

In 1949, the percentages of completion of the annual plans by various important industrial departments were as follows: Ministry of Iron and Steel Industry 102, Ministry of Petroleum Industry 103, Ministry of Coal Industry 103, Department of Power Stations 101, Ministry of Chemical Industry 104, Ministry of Electrical Industry 105, Ministry of Transportation Equipment Industry 103, Ministry of Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Industry 106, Ministry of Automobile and Tractor Industry 103, Ministry of Machine Tool Manufacturing Industry 106, Ministry of Machine and Tool Manufacturing Industry 103, Ministry of Agricultural Machinery Industry 100, Ministry of Light Industry 108, Ministry of Food Industry 104, Department of Production Cooperatives 106.

In 1949, the percentage increases in the output of various important industries compared to 1948 were as follows: pig iron 119, steel 125, rolled metal 127, coal 113, petroleum 114, gasoline 110, electricity 118, main-line electric locomotives 216, passenger cars 226, ball bearings 128, metallurgical equipment 127, automatic loaders 660, metal-cutting machine tools (manufactured by the Ministry of Machine Tool Manufacturing Industry) 119, tractors 155, synthetic rubber 136, mobile houses 154, bicycles 144, radios 165, sewing machines 134, clocks and watches 194, cameras 106, cotton fabrics 114, woolen fabrics 119, silk fabrics 128, leather shoes 122, sugar 123, canned food 135.

In 1949, there was further improvement in the utilization of industrial equipment. Notable progress has been made in the adoption and development of new technologies and the mechanization of arduous labor processes. More than three hundred of the most important new designs for highly productive machines and equipment have been created and have been handed over to the domestic industry for mass production.

	Agriculture:

The total agricultural output in 1949 exceeded the pre-war level of 1940. The total harvest of grain and industrial crops was higher than in 1948. The total grain output reached 7.6 billion poods and almost reached the 1950 target set by the Five-Year Plan. The sown area for various crops harvested in 1949 increased by 6 million hectares compared to 1948. The winter sowing plan for the 1950 harvest has been implemented. The land cultivated for the 1950 harvest increased by 8.3 million hectares compared to the land cultivated for the 1949 harvest.

In 1949, agriculture received 150,000 15-horsepower tractors, 29,000 combines, including 12,000 self-propelled combines, 64,000 freight trucks, and over 1.6 million seeders and other agricultural machines. This is two to three times more than the tractors, trucks, and agricultural machines obtained before the war in 1940.

In 1949, collective farm peasants and state farm workers also achieved great success in implementing the three-year plan for developing public livestock breeding. Throughout the year, nearly 120,000 collective farm breeding farms for beef cattle and dairy cows, sheep, pigs, and poultry were established. In 1949, the number of productive livestock owned by collective farms, according to preliminary estimates, increased as follows: beef cattle and dairy cows by 21 percent, pigs by 78 percent, sheep by 19 percent, and horses by 22 percent. Poultry doubled. The increases in state farms were as follows: beef cattle and dairy cows by 13 percent, pigs by 46 percent, sheep by 12 percent, and horses by 13 percent. The number of productive livestock owned by collective farms increased compared to the pre-war 1940 as follows: beef cattle and dairy cows by 27 percent, sheep by 44 percent, and pigs by 16 percent.

The Party and the government's plans for afforestation, the adoption of pasture and crop rotation systems, and the construction of ponds and reservoirs to ensure annual bumper harvests in the grasslands and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union are being victoriously implemented. Protective forest belts have been planted in an area of 590,000 hectares, of which 370,000 hectares were planted in 1949. Collective farms and state farms nearly doubled the 1949 afforestation plan. 800,000 hectares of land have been prepared for future planting.

	Transportation:

Rail transportation volume increased by 17 percent compared to 1948 and exceeded the pre-war level. The average daily railway freight volume exceeded the 1949 plan by 3 percent. In 1949, the average daily freight volume of various goods increased by 16 percent compared to 1948.

Inland river transportation exceeded the plan by 2 percent. Maritime transport completed the plan.

The volume of goods transported by motor vehicles increased by 28 percent compared to 1948, and almost doubled compared to the pre-war year of 1940.

	Basic Construction in the National Economy:

Its scale was equivalent to 120 percent of that in 1948. From 1946 to 1949, 5,200 state-owned industrial enterprises (not including small state-owned enterprises and cooperative enterprises) were rebuilt or restored and have been opened for business.

	Trade:

Based on the steady rise of the economy, the increasing production of consumer goods, and the new achievements in reducing costs, the government, after abolishing the rationing system, completed the second price reduction on March 1, 1949, thereby further increasing the sales of goods to the people. The goods sold to the people in 1949 (calculated at comparable prices) increased by 20 percent compared to 1948. The sales of food increased by 17 percent, and industrial products by 25 percent.

	Increase and Training of Workers and Staff:

In 1949, the number of workers and staff engaged in the Soviet national economy increased by 1.8 million compared to 1948, exceeding 1940 by 15 percent. The number of workers and staff in industry, agriculture, forestry, construction, and transportation increased by 1.4 million, while the number of workers and staff working in education, research, and medical institutions increased by 250,000.

In 1949, 723,000 young skilled workers graduated from vocational, railway, and factory training schools and were assigned to work in industry, construction, and transportation departments. In 1949, 6.6 million workers were trained and improved their skills.

	Enrollment in Primary and Secondary Schools Exceeds This Year's Target

	Culture:

In 1949, significant achievements were made in all aspects of socialist culture. At the end of last year, there were more than 36 million students studying in seven-year primary schools, middle schools, technical schools, and other specialized schools (about 2 million more than in 1948); in 1949, the number of students in seven-year primary schools and middle schools exceeded the 1950 target set by the Five-Year Plan for such schools. In 1949, there were 864 higher education institutions. The number of students in higher education institutions (including correspondence students) reached 1,128,000, 316,000 more than in 1948, and the number of students in technical schools and other secondary specialized schools (including correspondence students) totaled 1,308,000, exceeding the pre-war level by 333,000. The number of experts graduating from higher education institutions and technical schools and engaged in the national economy increased by 68 percent compared to the pre-war year of 1940. The number of scientific research institutes increased by one and a half times compared to 1940, and the number of researchers nearly doubled.

	People's Welfare:

In 1949, new hospitals were built, and existing hospitals were expanded to accommodate 38,000 more patients. The number of beds for maternity care in hospitals and maternity hospitals has greatly increased. The number of medical doctors and physicians in 1949 was 26,000 more than in 1948.

During the period from 1946 to 1949, the total area of housing built or restored by state enterprises, governments, agencies, local Soviets, and the people with the help of state loans was more than 72 million square meters. In addition, 2.3 million houses were built or restored in rural residential areas. In 1949, 185 water mains were repaired and re-laid in cities, towns, and workers' residential areas. During the period from 1946 to 1949, 27 more cities established tram and trolleybus services. Much work has been done in residential gas service, paving city streets and squares, and opening parks, boulevards, and gardens.
