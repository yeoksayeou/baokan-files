    Private Housheng Match Factory Union Leads Workers in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    Manager States Intention to Expand Factory Buildings and Equipment
    [Beijing News] The union of the private Housheng Match Factory in Beijing has implemented the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital for the past year, promoting the production enthusiasm of the capitalists and achieving remarkable results in increasing production efficiency and improving product quality. Based on the experience of the past year, the factory union is planning to work with the factory this year to increase equipment and strive to expand production. After the liberation of Beijing, on the second day of the union's establishment in February last year, the factory workers responded to the union's call to develop production, increasing the output from ten boxes of matches per day to fifteen boxes. The union relied on the masses to defeat the reactionary elements who controlled the factory's patrol team and children's corps to carry out conspiracy activities. After improving the unreasonable supervision system of beating and scolding workers in the past, the workers' class consciousness and production enthusiasm were further enhanced, and output continued to increase. In April, the output increased from fifteen boxes per day to twenty boxes. During the production competition in May, it increased to twenty-three boxes, and it has now increased to twenty-eight boxes, an increase of 1.8 times compared to the time of liberation. In late May, a fire broke out in the factory warehouse, and more than a hundred boxes of finished products were stored in the yard. The workers bravely rushed into the fire to rescue them, losing only eleven boxes. Including the loss of work on that day, the total loss was twenty-six boxes, which was compensated by the union leading the workers to automatically increase production by one box per day. After the factual lesson of the workers' production enthusiasm in this incident, the capitalists also broke through their concerns at the beginning of liberation and actively purchased a large number of raw materials. When solving the workers' welfare problems, the factory union appropriately cooperated with the development of production, taking into account the factory's income and expenditure, such as in November last year, in order to compensate the factory for the expenses of making cotton clothes for the workers, the workers used their Sunday holiday to voluntarily process for four days. Before liberation, the quality of matches was not good, the medicine was unevenly applied, and there were often explosions when used. Now, the union has led the workers to research and improve them. Therefore, the factory's matches sell well. Last year, the factory produced 6,446 boxes, and 97 percent were sold. Before liberation, there were 80 catties of double-headed defective matches every day, which has now been reduced to 50 catties; a lot of materials such as clamping plates, wood edges, and iron parts have also been saved. This year, the factory union will focus on further improving production as its work center, and will continue to study and improve technology, improve quality, and strive to become a model for developing production among private factories in Beijing. Zhang Wenbing, the manager of the factory, said: This year, he will discuss and formulate an annual production plan with the workers, expand the factory buildings, and build equipment for drying matchsticks in order to expand production.

    私营厚生火柴厂工会领导工人增产节约
    经理表示将扩充场房设备
    【北京讯】北京私营厚生火柴厂工会一年来执行了发展生产劳资两利的政策，推动了资方的生产积极性，在增加生产效率、提高产品质量上，获得显著成绩。根据去年一年来的经验，该厂工会正计划在今年内随同厂方增建设备努力扩大生产。北京解放后，去年二月间工会成立的第二天，该厂工人即响应工会发展生产的号召，使产量由日产火柴十箱提高到十五箱。工会依靠群众打垮了控制该厂纠察队和儿童团进行阴谋活动的反动分子，改善了过去打骂工人不合理的监工制后，工人的阶级觉悟和生产情绪更加提高，产量不断增加，四月间由日产十五箱提高到二十箱，五月生产竞赛时，又增加到二十三箱，到目前已增到二十八箱，比刚解放时提高一点八倍。五月下旬该厂仓库失火，场内存有成品百余箱，工人奋不顾身闯入火场抢救，只损失了十一箱，加上当天误工的损失共二十六箱，这些损失由工会领导工人自动每天增产一箱而得到弥补。经过此次工人生产热情的事实教训，资方也打破了解放初期的顾虑，积极购进大批原料。该厂工会在解决工人福利问题时，适当地和发展生产配合起来，照顾到了工厂收支盈亏，如去年十一月为补偿厂方给工人做棉衣的开支，工人利用星期日休假义务加工四天。解放前火柴品质不好，用药不均匀，使用时常有爆响，现在已经工会领导工人研究改进，因之该厂火柴销路畅旺，去年全年产六千四百四十六箱，销出占百分之九十七。解放前每天有双头残废火柴八十斤，现已减到五十斤；夹力板、木边、铁活等材料也节省很多。今年该厂工会是以更进一步提高生产为工作中心，将继续研究改进技术，提高质量，争取做北京市私营工厂中发展生产的模范。该厂经理张文炳表示：今年要和工人一起讨论订立全年生产计划，扩充场房，修建烘干火柴秆的设备，以求扩大生产。
