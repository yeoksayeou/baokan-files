    Northeast China, including cities such as Jilin, Changchun, Shenyang, and Harbin, has registered a total of over 5,600 unemployed ironworkers, electricians, light industry workers, and female workers in the past three months. Based on the needs of various state-owned factories and mines and their technical skills, over 2,000 people have been referred to jobs. Among them, Shenyang City has referred nearly 1,000 people to Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Benxi Coal and Iron Company, Shenyang Bridge Factory, and Railway Factory. Most factories and mines have assigned appropriate work according to their technical skills, and efforts are made to avoid career changes so that their skills can continue to be utilized. In November of last year, Harbin referred a total of 1,148 unemployed workers to forestry, Shenyang Machinery Factory, and major enterprises in Harbin. In December, it planned to refer a large number of workers to Benxi Iron Mine and other places. More than 150 people have already registered.

    [Another Dispatch] The Lüda Administrative Office recently convened the mayor and deputy mayors of Dalian City and personnel officials from various public enterprises to study and appropriately coordinate labor, thus solving the employment problems of 553 elderly, middle-aged, and unemployed women. With the development of production, Dalian City has generally felt a labor shortage for some time. However, there are also a number of elderly, middle-aged, and young men and women with limited skills and education (mostly women) who are still unemployed. The reason is that many enterprises and factories in the city generally have higher requirements when hiring workers, and some enterprises, regardless of the job, such as janitorial work, prefer young people, which affects the employment opportunities of the above-mentioned unemployed people who have certain labor capacity or can be trained and educated. After this study, the factories transferred young janitors to heavier work or to learn technical skills, and replaced them with elderly people as janitors. For young men and women, in addition to some learning technical skills or working as ordinary workers, the transportation company also hired some young women as streetcar drivers, replacing some male workers to participate in production in factories. As a result, the employment problems of more than 500 unemployed workers were quickly resolved.

    东北沈阳等城市
    三千失业工人就业
    大连调剂劳力解决一部妇女老年人职业
    【本报讯】东北吉林、长春及沈阳、哈尔滨等市，近三个月来，共登记失业铁工、电工、轻工业工人及女工等共五千六百余人，并根据各国公营厂矿需要及其技术能力，介绍就业者达二千余人。其中沈阳市介绍到鞍山钢铁公司、本溪煤铁公司及沈市桥梁工厂、铁路工厂者即近千人。各厂矿大部均按其本人技术分配适当工作，并尽量作到不改行，使其技术继续发挥。哈尔滨去年十一月份共介绍一千一百四十八名失业工人到林业、沈阳机械厂及哈市各主要企业部门就业，十二月份计划给本溪铁矿等地介绍大批工人，现已有一百五十余人登记。
    【又讯】旅大行署最近召集大连市正副市长及各公营企业人事负责干部，研究适当调剂劳动力后，解决了五百五十三名老中年及妇女失业者就业问题。大连市随着生产的发展，早已普遍感到劳动力缺乏，但是另有一部分老年人、中年人和部分缺乏技术与学力的青年男女（女的占多数），尚无职业，原因是该市许多企业工厂在采用工人时，一般的要求较高，且有部分企业单位，不管做什么工作，像杂役工也都愿意要青年人，致影响以上部分有一定劳动力或可以培养教育的失业者获得职业。经此次研究后，各厂将青年杂工调换作重活或学技术，改用老年人作杂工。对青年男女，除一部分学技术或当普通工人外，交通公司并采用部分年青妇女当电车司机，替换部分男工到工厂参加生产，结果五百余名失业工人的职业问题即迅速获得解决。
