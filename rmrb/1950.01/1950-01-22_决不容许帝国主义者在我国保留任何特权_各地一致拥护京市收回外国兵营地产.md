    Absolutely Not Permitting Imperialists to Retain Any Privileges in Our Country
    All Regions Unanimously Support Beijing Municipality's Recovery of Foreign Barracks Land
    [Reported by this newspaper] According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch: People from all regions and all democratic parties enthusiastically support the Beijing Military Control Commission's measure to recover the former U.S., French, and Dutch barracks land, safeguarding national sovereignty. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions believes that this action fully conforms to the demands and aspirations of the Chinese people's century-long and the Chinese working class's decades-long heroic struggle: to completely abolish imperialist privileges in China. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation stated: Women will forever remember the imperialist atrocities of insulting and persecuting Chinese women and children caused by the traitorous acts of the Kuomintang reactionary government. Today, Beijing has recovered the former U.S., French, and Dutch barracks land, and we feel incomparably excited. Hu Juewen, Deputy Director of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: The industrial and commercial circles have suffered from the oppression of unequal treaties for many years, so we absolutely support the People's Government's measures to abolish imperialist privileges. The Wuhan Women's Federation said in a telegram: Recovering national sovereignty can only be achieved with the conditions and strength after the founding of the People's Republic of China. This is something worth celebrating. Workers, youth, students, women, industry and commerce groups, and other organizations in Nanjing, Wuhan, Nanchang, Baoding, Qingdao, and other cities also pointed out that this is a measure that truly represents the will of the people; only the people's own government can truly abolish imperialist privileges in China.
    The Jiusan Society said in a declaration: "This is a patriotic action by the People's Government, representing the Chinese people, to resolutely implement the Common Program of the CPPCC and overthrow one of the privileges of the imperialists in China. It washes away the humiliation of nearly a hundred years of unequal treaties, which is truly exciting."
    Chen Jianchen, Acting Chairman of the Shanghai-Nanjing Regional Temporary Working Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: "On the land of the new China after the establishment of the People's Government, no imperialist country is absolutely allowed to retain privileges."
    The Shanghai Temporary Working Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association believes that the Chinese people, who have turned themselves over in the victory of the people's democratic revolution, will never allow even a fraction of an imperialist privilege to exist on the land of the motherland, not even the slightest blemish.

    决不容许帝国主义者在我国保留任何特权
    各地一致拥护京市收回外国兵营地产
    【本报讯】据新华社电讯：各地人民及各民主党派热烈拥护北京市军管会收回前美、法、荷三国兵营地产的卫护国家主权的措施。上海市总工会筹委会认为这一行动完全符合中国人民百年来和中国工人阶级几十年来英勇斗争的要求和愿望：彻底取消帝国主义在华特权。上海市民主妇联筹委会表示：妇女们永远记得，国民党反动政府的卖国行为所造成的帝国主义侮辱与迫害中国妇女儿童的暴行。今天北京收回了前美、法、荷兵营地产，我们感到无比的兴奋。工商联副主任胡厥文说：工商界历年身受不平等条约的压迫，所以我们绝对拥护人民政府取消帝国主义特权的措施。武汉市妇联通电说：收回国家主权，只有在中华人民共和国成立后才有条件、有力量办到，这是件值得庆祝的事。南京、武汉、南昌、保定、青岛等市的工人、青年、学生、妇女、工商等团体也都指出这是真正代表人民意志的措施；只有人民自己的政府才能真正废除帝国主义的在华特权。
    九三学社在宣言中说：“这是人民政府代表中国人民坚决执行政协共同纲领推翻了帝国主义者在中国的特权之一种爱国行动，它一洗近百年来不平等条约之屈辱，真是令人万分兴奋。”
    中国国民党革命委员会沪宁区临时工作委员会代主任委员陈建晨说：“人民政府成立后的新中国土地上，绝对不允许任何帝国主义国家保留特权的。”
    中国民主建国会上海市临时工作委员会认为，在人民民主革命胜利中翻了身的中国人民，是决不容许祖国的土地上还有一分一厘的帝国主义特权，那怕是任何一点斑点。
