Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 4th: The French imperialist puppet Bảo Đại in Vietnam and the French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Pignon, signed a so-called "transfer of power" agreement in Saigon on December 30th. This agreement was signed based on the treasonous agreement signed by Bảo Đại with French President Auriol in Paris on March 8th of last year, which stipulated that Vietnam would be "independent" within the French Federation, France would retain special jurisdiction in Vietnam, Vietnam's diplomatic power would be "entrusted to France," French colonists would maintain military bases in Vietnam, French troops could move freely in Vietnam, France could freely invest in Vietnam, and Vietnamese schools at all levels would continue to teach French, etc. According to an Associated Press report from Paris on December 30th: the agreement signed in Saigon specifically stipulates that Frenchmen will serve as prosecutors in the Haiphong and Saigon local courts for ten years. Disputes between Vietnamese people and other members of the "French Federation" will be handled by mixed courts; some of Vietnam's security forces will still be led by the French High Commissioner; the president of the National University will be appointed by the French President; and French officials will serve as advisors in Vietnamese local administrative organs, etc. This agreement will officially "take effect" after being approved by the French Parliament.

The Vietnam News Agency quoted Radio Voice of Vietnam's commentary on this agreement on December 31st, saying: the celebration in Saigon on December 30th is just a propaganda trick, and it does not mean that France is truly transferring power to Bảo Đại and his gang of puppets. The broadcast listed the contents of the agreement, explaining that this kind of "independence" is actually still subordinate to French imperialism. The broadcast stated: the Bảo Đại puppet government was rejected by the Vietnamese people even before it was truly established. The broadcast concluded: in any case, Bảo Đại and those who are putting on a show with him will not be able to last long. The Vietnamese people will give them and the French warmongers a historical lesson, just like the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang just received from the Chinese people.

    法帝与傀儡保大玩弄“移交政权”
    【新华社北京四日电】法帝国主义在越南的傀儡保大与法国驻越高级专员皮农，于十二月三十日在西贡签署所谓“移交政权”的协定。这一协定是根据去年三月八日保大在巴黎与法国总统阿利奥尔签订的卖国协定而签订的，后者曾规定越南在法兰西联邦内“独立”，法国在越南保有特别裁判权，越南的外交权“托付给法国”，法国殖民者在越南保有军事基地，法军可在越南自由行动，法国可以在越南自由投资，越南各级学校继续教授法文等。据美联社巴黎十二月三十日消息：这次在西贡签订的协定具体规定：在海防与西贡地方法院中，十年内由法国人任检察官。越南人与“法国联邦”中其他人员发生争执时，由混合法庭处理；越南的某些保安队仍由法国高级专员率领；国立大学的校长由法国总统任命；法国官员担任越南地方行政机构中的顾问等。这一协定待法国议会批准后即正式“生效”。
    越南通讯社引越南之声广播电台十二月三十一日对此一协定的评论称：十二月三十日西贡的庆祝，只是一种宣传把戏而已，它并不表示法国真正把大权移交给保大那一帮傀儡。广播列举协定的内容，说明这种“独立”，实际上仍是附属于法国帝国主义。广播称：保大傀儡政府甚至在还没有真正产生以前，就受到了越南人民的唾弃。广播结语称：无论如何，保大和同他一道粉墨登场的人们，是支持不了多久的，越南人民将使他们和法国战争贩子得到一个历史教训，就象蒋介石匪帮刚从中国人民那里得到的教训一样。
