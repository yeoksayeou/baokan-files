    Absorbing the Sentiment of Loving the Motherland
    ——Recommending *Pirogov*
    Mi Liangqing
    *Pirogov* is a historical film depicting the life and deeds of the great Russian medical scientist, Pirogov. After watching it, we feel that, like many Soviet works with historical themes, it not only allows us to see the true face of an advanced figure in Russian history, but more importantly, it can allow us to draw from it an infinite love for our motherland, sentiment and strength.
    Lenin once said: "In every national culture, there are two national cultures. There is the Great Russian culture of the Purishkeviches, Guchkovs, and Struves, and similarly, there is the Great Russian culture characterized by the names of Chernyshevsky and Plekhanov." He also said: "In every national culture, there are democratic and socialist cultural elements, even if they are undeveloped; because in every nation, there are laboring and exploited masses, and the living conditions of these masses will inevitably give rise to democratic and socialist ideologies." Undoubtedly, in the darkest years of Russia, Pirogov represented precisely one of the figures in Chernyshevsky's and the masses' Great Russian cultural system.
    Pirogov can be said to be a brand-new figure emerging from the people in that era. He possessed a high degree of loyalty to serving the people, pursuing, longing, and working intensely to snatch Russia—his own motherland—from the autocratic, ignorant, barbaric, and backward rule, to liberate it, to lead it onto a new path of development, and to push it forward. For this lofty goal, he struggled throughout his life, tirelessly laboring, and he waged an uncompromising struggle against all the evil forces that hindered him from dedicating the power of his entire life to this goal. The finest qualities of the Russian national character are embodied in him, which is very profound and moving.
    Pirogov said: "I believe the motherland will not forget me!" Yes, the people will not forget the great men who have made contributions to loving the motherland and serving the people. The people will forever commemorate him, and they will breathe the spirit of heroism from him, absorbing his courage, tenacity, and the sentiment of loving the motherland and the people that cannot be conquered by any evil forces, in order to dedicate their lives to building their new country.

    吸取热爱祖国的感情
    ——推荐起死回生
    米粱青
    《起死回生》是一部描写俄罗斯伟大医学家比罗果夫生活和事迹的历史片。我们看了以后，觉得像苏联许多以历史为题材的著作一样，它不仅使我们看到了俄罗斯民族历史上一位先进的人物的真实面目，而更重要的是它可以使我们从中吸取到无限热爱祖国的感情和力量。
    列宁曾说过：“在每一个民族文化里面，都有着两种民族文化。有着蒲里希维奇、古奇柯夫和斯特鲁威之流的大俄罗斯文化，同样的，也有着以契尔尼雪夫斯基及普烈哈诺夫的名字为特征的大俄罗斯文化”。他又说：“在每一个民族文化里面，都有着即使是没有发展出来的民主主义与社会主义的文化成份；因为在每一个民族里面，都有劳动和被剥削的群众，这些群众的生活条件，不可避免的会滋生出民主主义和社会主义的意识形态来的”。无疑的，在俄罗斯最黑暗的年代里，比罗果夫所代表的就正是契尔尼雪夫斯基的和群众的这一大俄罗斯文化系统中的人物之一。
    比罗果夫可以说是在那样年代里从人民中间涌现出来的一个崭新的人物，他怀着为人民服务的高度忠诚，强烈的追求着、渴望着、工作着，要把俄罗斯——自己的祖国，从专制、愚昧、野蛮、落后的统治中抢夺解放出来，把它导入新的发展轨道，推向前进。为了这崇高的目标，他奋斗了一生，不疲的劳动着，他在和一切阻碍着他为这目标献出全生命力量的恶势力进行了毫不妥协的斗争。在他身上体现了俄罗斯民族性格中最优秀的品质，这是十分深刻而动人的。
    比罗果夫说：“我相信祖国不会忘记我！”是的，人民是不会忘记了那些为了热爱祖国，为了服务人民而建树了功绩的伟人的。人民还将永远纪念着他，并要从他的身上来呼吸英雄的气息，吸取其难以被一切恶势力所征服的那种勇敢、坚韧的精神和热爱祖国与人民的感情，来为建设自己的新的国家而献出的生命的活动。
