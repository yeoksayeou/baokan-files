The Hammer that Demanded a Higher Status
Xia Yuan

(I)
One morning, the old blacksmith sat on a thick, hard wooden stool, smoking his pipe, his eyebrows tightly knitted together, deep in thought and very distressed.

His old eyes, weathered by hardship, were fixed on a small hammer that was currently in a bad mood.

The old blacksmith was silent with worry for a long time, then turned to look at the increasingly blazing furnace fire, and couldn't help but ask:

"Comrade Little Hammer, we have to start work in a little while, the higher-ups are calling for increased production, time is so precious, not a minute or a second can be wasted, haven't you figured it out yet?"

This little hammer had only recently been assigned to work here from the engineering section. When he first arrived, he was fine, his work was quite stable, and he was able to complete his tasks on time. Later, because the sledgehammer didn't meet his expectations, sometimes landing a little to the left, and sometimes a little to the right, he became dissatisfied with the sledgehammer, thinking that the sledgehammer's working ability was not as good as his, but his treatment was better. He kept this opinion in his heart, and it developed further, and he became even more dissatisfied with his own position, thinking that he was being underutilized and his status was too low, often muttering to himself behind his back:

"Being an assistant to the sledgehammer doesn't offer any prospects for development; besides, hammering away all day long is always the same old ding-ding-dang-dang tune, it's really boring and doesn't suit my interests!"

The old blacksmith had the best eyesight, he had long seen that the little hammer's work was not stable enough. Although the little hammer didn't say it, he showed it in his work intentionally or unintentionally. The old blacksmith was also the most patient. He advised the little hammer, saying:

"Comrade Little Hammer, you shouldn't underestimate yourself, you know? The sledgehammer has greater working ability, so naturally it's more important, but without you, who would do the squaring and corner trimming, who would point out the curves? So you are also very important, you have your role."

No matter how earnestly the old blacksmith explained and helped, the little hammer, because he held on to individualism, was always planning for himself, putting "I" first, so he couldn't help but be concerned about his status. The old blacksmith's words in his heart were like a stone thrown into a pond, creating a few ripples that quickly returned to normal.

Seeing that it was time to work, the old blacksmith couldn't sit still, quickly stood up, and put his pipe on the windowsill. He looked at the little hammer, and then at the sledgehammer, and made up his mind, deciding to let the little hammer try to take on the sledgehammer's job.

(II)
The old blacksmith pulled a red-hot iron rod from the burning coal, and placed it on the shoulder of the firmly standing iron stool. The iron rod was thick and stout, and its black skin was now red and glaring. Its temper was fiery, and sparks flew everywhere. The old blacksmith grabbed the little hammer and said to him:

"You think the sledgehammer isn't as good as you, so let the sledgehammer rest for a while first, and ask you to do the sledgehammer's work. If it works, then we'll promote you. Just do it for everyone to see!"

The iron stool stood firmly in its work position day after day, never moving, always burying itself in hard work, bearing any heavy task without haggling. But this time it was different from usual. It glanced at the little hammer, snorted, and smiled at the furnace door:

"Look, the little hammer wants to do the sledgehammer's work! Can this be done?"

The furnace door, which had always been working steadily, without saying a word, neither worrying about the future nor caring about its status, also agreed with the iron stool's view:

"Who says it isn't so! I've been doing this line of work for over twenty years, and I've never seen a little hammer that can do the sledgehammer's work!"

The iron rod was even more dissatisfied:

"I demand that the old blacksmith not let him take me as a joke!"

The old blacksmith nodded and said sincerely to everyone:

"Let him try and see!"

The arrogant and conceited little hammer, hearing that the old blacksmith was going to assign him to do the sledgehammer's work, was so happy that his face shone with black light, thinking that he finally had a chance to display his great talent, and should show everyone what he could do, so that they wouldn't look down on him anymore. So he jumped up, and without considering how to start the work, he just started banging away in a chaotic manner. The old blacksmith could hardly control him.

The little hammer didn't value the work, thinking it was easy, and worked very carelessly. The red-hot iron rod paid no attention to him, lazily emitting a few small sparks, without changing in the slightest.

The hammer stool laughed loudly, and the furnace door couldn't help but laugh as well.

The little hammer was still not convinced, thinking: Can't I do this little bit of work well? So he jumped up again, banging away chaotically.

The stubborn iron rod was even more indifferent than before, not even willing to emit a spark, and its face turned increasingly green, impatiently saying:

"You're really overestimating yourself, thinking you can do the sledgehammer's work? If you can do everything, then no one else in this room is needed, everyone can leave, and you alone would be enough!"

After saying this, the iron rod withdrew its red face, put on its original gray and black expression, coldly looked at the little hammer, gasped roughly, and then remained silent. A group of small pieces of scrap iron resting in the corner also looked down on the little hammer, thinking he was too conceited.

(III)
The round iron rod was not flattened, and the ambitious but incompetent little hammer was panting for breath. Finally, he tried one more time, feeling that he had put in a lot of effort, but unfortunately his strength was limited, and he couldn't complete the task. At this point, he realized that his ability was not as good as the sledgehammer's, and he began to have some second thoughts.

The old blacksmith still patiently helped him:

"The sledgehammer's work always has to be done by the sledgehammer. You don't have enough strength, you can't do it, but if you don't do your work, we'll suffer a loss! You have to understand, your role is also very important!"

The iron stool interjected from the side:

"We, no matter who we are, are all very important. According to the size of our strength, we have a specific division of labor, and none of us can be missing."

"Yes!" The large pieces of coal added: "No one can be missing. If it weren't for me, Brother Furnace would have to be idle, but conversely, if it weren't for Brother Furnace, I would have great ability but would still have to stare blankly, isn't this a perfectly clear matter?"

The sledgehammer hadn't spoken all along, but at this point he couldn't restrain himself any longer and said simply: "Speaking of prospects, we should look at it this way: as long as our factory has prospects, then we all have prospects; if the factory has no prospects, what prospects do we have to talk about? Let's all work hard together, and in the future, Comrade Little Hammer, if I have any shortcomings, please feel free to point them out, don't be shy."

The large furnace, electric roller, iron tongs, the large iron hood that absorbs smoke, the belt, the pressure door... all expressed their views on this issue one after another. Everyone unanimously criticized Little Hammer's mistaken thinking. The old blacksmith finally emphasized that Little Hammer's demands for higher status and his restlessness at work were a serious form of individualism, and he encouraged him. As a result, the clever and capable Little Hammer finally saw the light with everyone's kind help. He shamefully reflected on his mistakes and resolutely stated:

"Comrades, I was wrong! I will definitely work hard in the future..."

    闹地位的小锤
    夏园
            （一）
    这一天清晨，老铁匠坐在粗胖的硬木樽上抽着烟斗，眼眉紧锁，深思苦虑，又很难过。
    他的饱经忧患的老眼睛，是在钉着一柄正闹情绪的小锤。
    老铁匠愁苦的沉默了好久，回头望望烧得渐渐炽盛的炉火，忍耐不住的问了：
    “小锤同志，等回儿咱们就得干活啦，上级号召加紧生产，时间可太宝贵，一分一秒也不能耽误，你还没想开这条道么？”
    这柄小锤是不久以前才从工务科分配到这里来工作的，刚来的时候，他还不错，工作尚称安心，能够按时完成任务。后来因为大锤没有按着他的指望，落脚有时偏左一些，有时又偏右一些，于是他就不大满意大锤，认为大锤的工作能力赶不上他，待遇却比他好。他把这个意见存在心里，发展起来，更不满意自己的职务了，以为大材小用，地位太低，时常背地嘟嘟念念：
    “我给大锤当个配角，没有发展前途；再说成天到晚敲着敲着，总是叮叮当当一个老调，实在枯燥，不合我的兴趣儿！”
    老铁匠是最有眼光的，他早已看出小锤的工作不够安心，虽然小锤不说出来，在工作中却有意无意的表现出来了，老铁匠也是最耐心的，他对小锤劝着说：
    “小锤同志，你不应该小看自己呀？大锤工作能力大些，自然重要，可是要没有你的话，谁来打楞修角，谁来指点找弯？所以说你也是很重要的，你有你的作用。”
    不论老铁匠多么苦口婆心的解释帮助，小锤因为抱着个人主义，老是给自己打算，“我”字第一，就不能不计较地位，老铁匠的话在他心里，好象石片投在池里，起了几行波纹就又恢复了常态。
    眼看到了工作时间，老铁匠坐不住了，急忙立起，把烟斗放在窗台上。他看了一看小锤，又望大锤一眼，下了决心，索性让小锤试着担任一下大锤的职务。
            （二）
    老铁匠从燃烧得十分旺盛的煤炭中间，抽出通红的铁棍，放在站得牢固的铁樽肩上。铁棍又粗又胖，黑色的皮肤这时红得刺眼，他的脾气暴燥，火星乱舞，老铁匠抓起小锤，向他说：
    “你看大锤赶不上你，那么先让大锤休息一下，请你来干大锤的活，如果能行，那么就把你提拔起来。你就干一下大家看吧！”
    铁樽十年如一日的立在自己的工作岗位，动也不动，从来都是埋头苦干，任劳任怨，不论多么重的工作，他都不讲价钱的负担下来。但是这回他却不同平常，瞥了一眼小锤，哼了一声，对着炉门微笑：
    “你看，小锤要干大锤的活！这能行么？”
    从来都是安心工作，一声不响，既不挂心前途，又不惦念地位的炉门，也很同意铁樽的看法：
    “谁说不是的呀！这一行我干了二十多年，我还从来没见过小锤能干大锤的活哩！”
    铁棍更不满意：
    “我要求老铁匠不要叫他来拿着我开玩笑！”
    老铁匠点了点头，诚恳的对大家说：
    “让他试一试看吧！”
    骄傲自大的小锤，听说老铁匠要分配他干大锤的活，乐的满脸射出黑光，以为这回可有了发挥天大才能的机会，应该露两手给大家看看，免得他们再瞧不起。于是他就跳了起来，也不考虑这个工作应该从何下手，叮叮当当就是一阵乱打，老铁匠几乎都掌握不住他了。
    小锤没有看重这个工作，认为轻而易举，干的又很粗率；烧红的铁棍满不理会他，懒懒洋洋的散出几点小小的火星，原样变也未变。
    锤樽哈哈大笑，炉门也情不自禁地笑了起来。
    小锤还不服气，心想：就凭着我干不好这点儿活么？于是他又纵身跳起，叮叮当当，乱干一阵。
    顽强的铁棍比起先前还要不动声色，连点火星也不肯冒，而且脸色越变越青，不耐烦的说：
    “真是不自量力，就凭着你能干大锤的活么？你要是什么都能干，那么这屋里谁也不用，都可以走散，留你一个也尽够了！”
    铁棍说完这话，就把红脸一收，板起本来又灰又黑的神气，冷冷的瞅瞅小锤，喘了一声粗气，以后便不响了。在墙角休息的一群个头不大的碎铁，也很轻视的望着小锤，认为他太自大。
            （三）
    滚圆的铁棍没有改扁，志大才疏的小锤，累的张口直喘。最后他又试了一次，自觉出力颇大，无耐力量有限，没有完成这个任务。到了这时，他才知道自己的能力，不如大锤，颇有些回心转意的意思了。
    老铁匠依然耐心的帮助他：
    “大锤的活，总得大锤来干，你的力量不够，干不上来，可是你的工作，你要不干，咱们可就有损失啦！你要明白，你的作用也是很大的呀！”
    铁樽从旁插了一句：
    “我们，不论是谁，都是很重要的，按着力量大小，具体分工，缺一不可。”
    “是呀！”大块的煤补充着说：“谁也不能缺少，要是没有我的话，炉子老兄就得闲起来，可是反过来说要是没有炉子老兄，我有天大的本事也得干瞪眼，这不是明明白白的事情么？”
    大锤一直没有开口，这时他也忍耐不住了，简单的说：“提起前途，应该这样的看，只要咱们工厂有了前途，那么咱们全都有了前途；工厂要没有前途，咱们还有什么前途可说呢？咱们大家好好干吧，以后我有什么缺点，小锤同志尽管多提，不要客气。”
    大炉、电滚、铁钳、吸收烟火的庞大铁罩、皮带、压门……都先后的发表了自己对于这个问题的看法。大家一致的批评了小锤的错误思想。老铁匠最后着重的指出小锤的闹地位和不安心工作，乃是严重的个人主义，并且鼓励了他一番，于是，聪明能干的小锤在大家好心好意的帮助之下终于想开窍了。他惭愧地反省了自己的错误，坚决的表示：
    “同志们，我想错了！以后一定要好好的干……”
