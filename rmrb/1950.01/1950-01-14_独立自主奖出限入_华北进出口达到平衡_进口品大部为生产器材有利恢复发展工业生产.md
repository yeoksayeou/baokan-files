    "Independence and Autonomy, Rewarding Exports, Limiting Imports"
    North China's Imports and Exports Reach Balance
    Imported Goods Mostly Production Equipment, Conducive to Restoring and Developing Industrial Production
    [Our Newspaper] Under the guidance of the policy of "Independence and Autonomy, Rewarding Exports, Limiting Imports," North China's foreign trade, after a year of efforts, has reached a roughly balanced state of imports and exports, fundamentally changing the colonial foreign trade of "absolute import surplus" during the Kuomintang rule. From March to December 28th of last year, the total value of goods exported from Tianjin with the approval of the North China Foreign Trade Administration reached more than 51.6 million US dollars, while the total import value was more than 47.9 million US dollars. The total value of imports and exports is nearly 100 million US dollars. Not only has the total export value exceeded the standard of the Kuomintang rule period, but also the types of import and export goods have undergone fundamental changes. In the past, import and export goods essentially served imperialism and bureaucratic compradors, with exports being production raw materials and imports being mostly luxury goods and non-essential goods. For example, in 1936, cotton exports alone reached more than 6.9 million US dollars; while the luxury goods made of cotton, silk, hemp, wool, and leather imported in the same year accounted for 9.56% of the total import value that year; in 1947, the import of the above-mentioned luxury goods accounted for 27.6% of the total import value for the year. In 1936, imports of alcohol, rice, flour, fruits, tobacco, etc., accounted for 13.3% of the total import value; in 1947, it even reached 42.14%. After liberation, North China's foreign trade initially shifted to serving the people, gradually developing forward under the principle of being conducive to "developing production and prospering the economy." Among the exported goods throughout the year, eggs were the most numerous. From March to November, they accounted for 12.38% of the total export value. The second were carpets, vegetable oils, etc. As for production materials such as cotton and hemp, which are needed by the people domestically, they have completely disappeared. Among the imported goods, most were essential production equipment and industrial raw materials. According to statistics, from March to November 1949, telecommunications, transportation, chemical equipment, and the most lacking packaging materials such as gunny sacks accounted for 27.31% of the total import value; chemical and metallurgical raw materials for industrial and medical use accounted for 47.11% of the total import value; lubricating oil and gasoline for power accounted for 5.9%; books and paper accounted for 5.12%. All luxury goods have been banned from import. Therefore, the annual foreign trade has played a significant role in restoring and developing production. For example, due to the large imports of rubber materials, dinitrobenzene, hardware, needle cloth, and paraffin wax, the rubber, dye, hardware, and textile industries in Tianjin were able to rapidly resume production and achieve certain development. At the same time, due to the large-scale export of eggs, more than 20 egg factories in North China that had completely shut down before liberation were able to fully resume work and achieve great development, which directly stimulated the rural egg production.

    “独立自主奖出限入”
    华北进出口达到平衡
    进口品大部为生产器材有利恢复发展工业生产
    【本报讯】在“独立自主、奖出限入”的方针指导下，华北对外贸易，经一年来的努力，进出口已达到大致平衡状态，基本上改变了过去国民党统治时期“绝对入超”的殖民地性对外贸易。从去年三月到十二月廿八日止，经华北对外贸易管理局批准从天津出口的货物总值达五千一百六十余万美元，进口总值则为四千七百九十余万美元。总计进出口总值近一亿美元。不但出口总值已超过了过去国民党统治时期的标准，且进出口货物的种类，也发生了根本的变化。过去进出口货物，本质上是为帝国主义和官僚买办服务的，出口的都是生产原料，进口的大半是奢侈品和非必需品。例如一九三六年，仅棉花一项，出口即达六百九十余万美元；而同年进口的棉、丝、麻、毛、皮制的奢侈品，却占该年进口总值的百分之九·五六；一九四七年，上述奢侈品进口，更占了全年进口总值的百分之二七·六。一九三六年，酒类、米谷、面粉、果品、烟草等进口，共占进口总值的百分之一三·三；一九四七年更占到百分之四二·一四。解放后华北对外贸易，一开始即转变到为人民服务的方向，在有利于“发展生产，繁荣经济”的原则下逐步向前发展。全年出口货物中以蛋品为最多。从三月到十一月，共占出口总值的百分之一二·三八。其次是地毯、植物油等。至于向为国内人民所需要的棉花、麻类等生产资料，则完全绝迹。在进口货物中，则大部为必需的生产器材和工业原料。据统计一九四九年三到十一月间，进口的电讯、交通、化工等器材和包装最缺乏的麻袋等，占进口总值的百分之二七·三一；工业及医药用的化工、冶金原料等，共占进口总值的百分之四七·一一；动力用机油、汽油等占百分之五·九；图书及纸张占百分之五·一二。所有奢侈品，均已禁绝进口。因此，全年的对外贸易，对恢复与发展生产起了很大作用。例如由于胶料、二硝基、五金、针布、石腊等的大量进口，使天津橡胶、染料、五金、纺织等工业得以迅速恢复生产，并获得了一定发展。同时由于蛋品的大批出口，解放前完全停工的华北二十多家蛋厂，得以全部复工，并获得很大发展。从而又直接刺激了农村的鸡蛋生产。
