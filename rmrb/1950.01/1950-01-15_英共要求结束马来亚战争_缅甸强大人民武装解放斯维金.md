Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 14th: TASS, London, January 13th: The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on January 12th, reiterating its demand to end the Malayan war and recall British soldiers. The statement considers this war a "barbaric war of aggression against the Malayan people fighting for their democratic rights and national freedom."

After describing the destruction of Malayan villages, the killing of women and children, and the imprisonment of thousands of Malayan people, the statement stated: "Conducting the Malayan war is an act of armed aggression against the workers, peasants, and freedom-loving people of Malaya. The continuation of the war only benefits tin and rubber monopolists, at the expense of the Malayan and British people. British monopolies accumulate huge profits every year, while the British people bear the burden of the war. It is the sacred duty of the British people to support the Malayan people and work to end the war."

The statement emphasized that the war against the Malayan people is a threat to world peace. The Communist Party calls on all sectors of the workers' movement to do everything possible to end this barbaric colonial war and strive to have the Malayan people's right to national independence recognized.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 14th: According to the Rangoon news carried in the Bangkok Chinese newspaper "Quan Min Bao" on December 2nd of last year, the people's armed forces are strong in the area of Jianbo Village and Xiguang Village, west of Liangli Shanbu, north of Pegu, on the Rangoon-Mandalay railway in Burma. Two thousand peasants in the villages in this area have been organized and armed. Under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party, they are carrying out various tasks to protect the harvested crops. They are equipped with fairly good weapons and are currently building fortifications around the villages to prevent disturbances from the Karen Self-Defense Forces. The Karen Self-Defense Forces are led by the Karen National Union and are a reactionary armed force fostered by British imperialism to undermine the Burmese national liberation movement, fighting not only against Thakin Nu's government army but also against the Burmese People's Democratic Allied Forces.

Because the Karen Self-Defense Forces implement a "three alls" policy (burn all, kill all, loot all), the villages along the railway line west of Liangli Shan and Binzhi Zha Bu have been almost completely destroyed, and residents have fled to the liberated areas. Currently, more than 2,000 thatched huts have been built in the Burmese liberated areas to house refugees, and food is being provided to them.

According to another report in Quan Min Bao on November 28th of last year, the people's armed forces in the Pegu-Toungoo area on the Rangoon-Mandalay railway line are very active, constantly attacking the strongholds of the Karen Self-Defense Forces. On November 20th, the people's armed forces attacked the Karen Self-Defense Forces in Swegin (northeast of Pegu). The Karen Self-Defense Forces were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed, and Swegin was liberated. The people's armed forces also liberated several nearby villages.

    英共要求结束马来亚战争
    缅甸强大人民武装解放斯维金
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社伦敦十三日讯：英国共产党执行委员会于一月十二日发表声明，再次要求结束马来亚战争和召回英国士兵。声明认为这个战争是“对为争取其民主权利和民族自由而战的马来亚人民的野蛮侵略战争”。
    声明在描述马来亚乡村的被毁灭、妇孺的遭杀戮及数以千计的马来亚人民被投入监狱之后称：“进行马来亚战争乃是对马来亚的工人、农民及爱好自由的人民进行武装侵略的行为。战争的继续只有利于锡和橡胶的垄断资本家，其代价是牺牲马来亚以及英国的人民。英国垄断资本每年积累巨额的利润，而英国人民却要担负战争的负担。支援马来亚人民并力促结束战争，乃是英国人民的神圣职责”。
    声明强调指出，对马来亚人民的战争就是对世界和平的威胁。共产党号召工人运动的各部门，尽一切可能结束这个野蛮的殖民地战争，并努力使马来亚人民要求民族独立的权利得到承认。
    【新华社北京十四日电】据曼谷华侨报纸《全民报》去年十二月二日载仰光消息称：缅甸庇古以北在仰光至曼德勒铁道上的良礼衫埠西面的坚波村和西光村一带，人民武装力量强大。这一带村庄里的农民，已有两千人组织与武装起来。他们正在缅甸共产党的领导下，进行着各种保护收割农作物的工作。他们有相当好的武器配备，最近正在各村外围建筑防御工事，以防克仑自卫队的扰乱。克伦自卫队由克伦民族同盟所领导，是英帝国主义者为破坏缅甸民族解放运动而扶植起来的反动武装力量，不仅与德钦努的政府军作战，而且也与缅甸人民民主联军作战。
    由于克仑自卫队实行三光政策，良礼衫及彬直渣埠西面沿铁路线一带各村，已被烧毁殆尽，居民纷纷逃向解放区，现缅甸解放区已建造二千余所茅屋，供难民居住，并以粮食救济难民。
    另据全民报去年十一月二十八日消息：仰光曼德勒铁路线上庇古东吁一带的人民武装部队，非常活跃，不时向克仑自卫队据点进攻。十一月二十日，人民武装攻击斯维金（庇古东北）的克仑自卫队，克仑自卫队不支溃退，斯维金遂告解放。人民武装同时解放附近村庄数座。
