The Anshan Iron and Steel Company Power Plant Implements Safe Operation System Experience

Xiao He

Electricity is the driving force of industrial production. A power failure can bring the entire factory to a standstill. Therefore, how to achieve a safe operation system and eliminate accidents has become the most important issue for all power departments. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company Power Plant has created experience on this issue that can be used for reference in various places.

    Resolutely Eliminate Accidents

The Anshan Iron and Steel Company Power Plant began to overcome the difficulties of incomplete equipment and lack of operating experience when it trialed a safe operation incentive system in October. It basically eliminated complete power outage accidents. In November, it fully achieved its operation tasks, and local accidents were also completely eliminated.

In June and July of this year, although the leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel raised the issue of safe operation, they did not carry out in-depth publicity and mobilization at the time, nor did they mobilize the masses to discuss and propose specific measures, resulting in several complete power outage accidents in the three months of July, August, and September, causing losses to state assets amounting to 7.15 billion yuan (Northeast currency).

In order to resolutely eliminate accidents and welcome a new high tide of industrial construction in the Northeast, the plant convened a joint meeting of worker representatives and the factory management committee in late September, and initially discussed the safe operation system of division of responsibility and machine inspection proposed by the leadership. After the representatives returned to their workplaces, they mobilized workers in each team to discuss and put forward opinions, and then collected the opinions of each team to the factory management committee for further research and inspection, and made a decision. It began to be implemented on a trial basis from October 1.

    What is a Safe Operation System

The safe operation system, on the one hand, clarifies the division of responsibility, so that each worker is more serious about managing the certain machines or work he is responsible for; on the other hand, it stipulates the time and system for machine operation, inspection, and repair, and strives for the initiative of people controlling things. In order to encourage workers' enthusiasm for labor, various incentive systems are also established.

When this responsibility system was first proposed at team discussion meetings, although the workers agreed, they had many concerns. They believed that accidents were difficult to avoid, not only because some machines were already old and many workers' operating skills were not yet proficient, but also because there were many objective factors affecting safe operation, such as electricity users pulling the wrong switches, ground faults in external power lines, thunderstorms, and overloading, all of which could cause accidents. Therefore, they felt unsure about implementing the responsibility system. In order to solve this concern, the leadership first raised the issue of distinguishing between responsible accidents and non-responsible accidents, and launched discussions in various units. For example: the power generation room proposed that if the generator failed due to too much water in the boiler or an explosion, and the steam pressure dropped to the lowest or even zero degrees, resulting in the auxiliary oil pump not being able to start, it would be a non-responsible accident; if the steam temperature exceeded the specified number of degrees and the boiler room was not notified in time, it would be a responsible accident. This was clearly stipulated, and the workers' confidence was improved and they dared to take responsibility.

    Implement Fixed Staffing, Establish Operation Pacts

Further discussions were held on the issue of fixed staffing. According to the needs of the machines, the number of operators was stipulated. One boiler room used 30 workers during the puppet Manchukuo period. Now, after discussions among the workers, it was believed that 12 people could operate it. After the number of people was determined, personnel were adjusted appropriately, and everyone was placed in the position where they were most confident and most experienced. Each machine has a fixed owner, and wooden signs are hung on the machines with the workers' names written on them. Therefore, everyone cherishes the machines they are responsible for even more, and accidents are reduced accordingly.

In order to avoid accidents during shift changes, they also stipulated an extremely thorough and detailed shift change inspection system. Each time the shift is handed over, the handover procedures are handled ten minutes in advance. If there are any unqualified phenomena, the shift will never be accepted and left. Accidents that occur after the shift is taken over will be the responsibility of the incoming worker. To ensure safe operation, the strength of one person or a few people is not enough. All the workers in the plant must unite, strengthen labor discipline, improve enthusiasm, and avoid affecting the whole due to the negligence or operational errors of a few people. After discussions by all the workers, an operation pact was automatically established, requiring everyone to abide by it.

    Stipulate Machine Inspection System

Giving play to the active spirit of workers is an important factor in ensuring safe operation, but simply relying on this point is not enough. Technical guarantees must also be relied upon at the same time. Therefore, various machine inspection systems were stipulated.

1.  Operation Log: In addition to the responsible workers taking care of their own machines, every hour a special person is assigned to check the pressure and temperature of steam, air, and oil, to see if the bearings have oil, the motor temperature is high or low, and the current magnitude, to prevent abnormal phenomena from occurring.
2.  Weekly General Inspection: Every Saturday afternoon, an inspection team composed of engineers, the director of the trade union, the foreman, and more than ten old technical workers conducts a general inspection of the machines in the entire factory. At the same time, the cleanliness of the factory buildings and fire and cold protection equipment are also checked. Because the work is conscientious and responsible, the inspection team plays a great role.
3.  Regular Overhaul: For major machines and their auxiliary machines, a timetable for operation and overhaul is determined based on the degree of newness and oldness, and implemented on schedule. This scientific use and repair of machines not only prolongs the life of the machines, but also reduces the occurrence of many accidents. In order to reward the workers' active and responsible spirit and encourage enthusiasm for labor, the company also stipulates an incentive system. After the safe operation task is completed at the end of each month, the company allocates bonuses. In October, the plant received a bonus of 60 million yuan, which was distributed to the workers in three grades.

    Sense of Responsibility Strengthened, Accidents Eliminated

After the implementation of the safe operation system, the face of the factory was completely renewed. On the walls next to the boilers, in the turbine room, and near the switchboards, eye-catching slogans such as "Eliminate Accidents!" and "Achieve Safe Operation!" can be seen everywhere. In the factory building, in addition to hearing the roar of the machines, almost no one can be seen or heard. Every worker stands near his own machine, concentrating on operating it. The sense of responsibility has been universally strengthened. They take care of each other and cooperate with each other in their work, which greatly reduces the occurrence of accidents. Once, the temperature gauge of the generator suddenly dropped from 370 degrees to 200 degrees, and steam and water splashed from the valve. When the workers saw this situation, they immediately opened all the water valves, avoiding a major accident of a complete power outage caused by a large amount of water coming from the boiler and damaging the steam teeth (steam blades) of the generator.

In the two months since the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Power Plant began to implement the safe operation system on a trial basis, it has basically eliminated accidents, and various tasks have been advanced a step forward. In the future, in addition to continuing to consolidate the safe operation system and improve it, efforts should be made to overcome the difficulty of the lack of measuring instruments, further determine quotas, so as to implement economic accounting and gradually reduce costs, and increase more wealth for the country.

    鞍山钢铁公司发电厂实行安全运转制的经验
    萧鹤
    电是工业生产的原动力。电源发生事故，会使整个工厂停摆。因此，如何达成安全运转制、消灭事故，就变成一切动力部门当前最主要的课题。鞍山钢铁公司发电厂，已在这个问题上创造的经验，可供各地参考。
            坚决消灭事故
    鞍山钢铁公司发电厂，从十月份试行安全运转奖励制，开始克服了设备不全和操作经验缺乏的困难，基本上消灭了全面停电事故；十一月份完全达成运转任务，局部事故也完全消灭了。
    在今年六、七月间，鞍钢领导上虽然提出了安全运转问题，可是，当时并没有深入宣传动员，没有发动群众讨论，提出具体办法，以致在七、八、九三个月连续发生几次全面停电的事故，给国家资财造成的损失达七十一亿五千万元（东北币，下同）。
    为了坚决消灭事故，迎接东北工业建设新高潮，该厂在九月下旬召开了工人代表与工厂管理委员联席会议，初步讨论了领导上提出来的分工负责和机器检查的安全运转制。各代表回到现场以后，就发动各班组工友讨论，分别提出意见，然后将各班组意见汇集到工厂管理委员会，进一步研究检查，作出决定。从十月一日起开始试行。
            什么叫做安全运转制
    安全运转制，一方面是明确分工负责，使每个工友对自己所负责的一定的机器或工作加倍认真管理；另方面是规定机器运转、检查及修补的时间和制度，争取了人支配事的主动权；为鼓舞工人劳动热忱，还定有各种奖励制。
    当这种负责制在班组讨论会上开始提出的时候，工友们虽然赞成，但是顾虑很多。他们认为发生事故很难避免，这不仅是因为有些机器已经陈旧，很多工友的操作技术还不纯熟，而且有许多影响安全运转的客观因素，例如用电部门拉错开关、厂外发生电线接地现象、暴雷雨、以及超过负荷等，都可以引起事故，因此对实行负责制感到没有把握。为解决这一顾虑，领导上首先提出责任事故和非责任事故的区别问题，发动各单位进行讨论。例如：发电室提出发电机如因锅炉过水太多或爆发，汽压降到最低甚至零度，以致补助油泵不能起动而发生的事故，就是非责任事故；因为蒸汽的温度超过度数，未能及时通知锅炉房而发生的事故，就是责任事故。并予以明文规定，这样工友信心提高，敢于负责了。
            实行定员，订立运转公约
    进一步就讨论定员问题，根据机器需要，规定出操作的工人数目。有一个锅炉室在伪满时用三十个工人，现在经过工友们讨论，认为十二个人即可操作。人数确定后，再适当调整人事，把每一个人放在他最有把握最有经验的岗位上。每部机器都有了固定的主人，在机器上悬挂木牌，写上工友的姓名。因此每个人对自己所负责的机器就更加爱护，事故也就随着减少了。
    为了避免交班时发生事故，他们又极为周到而细致的规定了交班检查制。每次交班时，提前十分钟办理交代手续，倘有不合格现象，绝不接班退班，接班以后发生的事故，就由接班工友负责。要保证安全运转，一个人或一部分人的力量是做不到的，必须全厂工友团结起来，加强劳动纪律，提高积极性，避免因少数人疏忽或操作错误以致影响全体。经过全体工友讨论后，即自动订出了运转公约，要求大家遵守实行。
            规定机器检查制度
    发挥工友的积极精神是保证安全运转的一个重要的因素，但是单纯地依靠这一点也还是不够的，必须同时依靠技术的保证，因此就规定了机器检查的各种制度。
    １、运转日志：除负责工友照顾自己的机器以外，每隔一小时即有专人来检查蒸汽的、送风的及油的压力和温度，看看轴承有油没有，马达温度高低，及电流大小，以防止发生异象。
    ２、每周总检查：每星期六下午由工程师、工会主任、班长及老技术工友十余人组成检查团，进行全厂机器的检查。同时对于厂房清洁，防火防寒设备等也加以检查。由于工作认真负责，所以检查团发挥的作用很大。
    ３、定期检修：对于各大件机器及其附属机器，根据新旧程度定出运转检修时间预定表，分别按期执行。这样科学地使用和检修机器，不仅延长了机器的寿命，而且减少许多事故的发生。为奖励工友积极负责的精神，鼓舞劳动热忱，公司并规定有奖励制，每月月终达成安全运转任务后，由公司拨给奖金。十月份该厂获得奖金六千万元，分三等发给工友。
            责任心加强，消灭了事故
    安全运转制实行以后，工厂面目焕然一新，在锅炉旁、透平室的墙壁上，配电盘的左近，到处可以看见“消灭事故！”“达成安全运转！”的醒目的大字标语。在厂房里除去听见机器的轰鸣外，几乎看不见人影，听不见人声，每个工友都站在自己的机器近旁，聚精会神地操作着，责任心普遍加强，在工作中互相照顾，互相配合，大大减少了事故的发生。有一次发电机的温度表突然由三七○度降到二○○度，气门有汽和水喷溅。工友们看见这种情形后，马上把所有的水门都放开，避免了因锅炉过来大量的水，把发电机的汽齿（汽叶）打坏，发生全部停电的大事故。
    鞍钢发电厂自开始试行安全运转制的两个月来，基本上已消灭了事故，各种工作都向前推进了一步。今后除应继续巩固安全运转制，并加以提高外，就应设法克服计器缺少的困难，进一步确定定额，以便实行经济核算，逐步减低成本，给国家增加更多的财富。
