Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 26th. As the People's Liberation Army advanced into Yunnan Province, they received enthusiastic support and welcome from the Salar, Lahu, Miao, Yao, and other ethnic groups in eastern Yunnan. Before the arrival of the army, people of the Salar, Lahu, Miao, and Yao ethnic groups actively participated in local people's organizations, such as welcoming and慰劳 teams and civilian labor teams, carrying out work such as raising grain and repairing roads. After the People's Liberation Army entered Yunnan Province, they went down the mountains to welcome the army. The Salar people living along the main roads set up many tea stations along the roads the army would pass, and old women in their fifties also helped their children climb to the top of the mountains where the army passed to boil water. The ethnic groups living in the remote Liangshan mountains, despite their poverty, carried their corn and millet over the mountains to give to the People's Government as military rations. The Lahu people of Longmai Village near Funing specially organized a dance troupe to go to Funing City to welcome the People's Liberation Army. Huang Lidong, a farmer from the dance troupe, said: "This time we have seen the light. In the past, we did not dare to enter the city, let alone talk to the army. Now that the People's Liberation Army has arrived, we can walk into the yamen, and the comrades treat us like brothers and gave us many things. This is the first time our Lahu people have encountered such a good army." The Miao and Yao people of Jiulong Mountain on the Yunnan border also came down the mountain one after another, bringing their chickens and cattle to慰劳 the army. Ethnic minorities living along the main road organized more than a dozen mule and horse transportation stations of various sizes. Some ethnic minorities also helped the army buy vegetables in the mountains dozens of miles away. People of all ethnic groups have complained to the People's Liberation Army about the crimes of exploitation and oppression committed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, such as conscription, grain requisition, and heavy taxes. Tao Dezheng, a Miao representative who welcomed the People's Liberation Army, said: "In the past, under the Kuomintang's hundreds of donations and thousands of taxes, we lived a tragic life of 'moving our homes in the third month of the peach blossom season.' Now that we have seen the Communist Party, the world has changed. In the past, we moved upwards, but today we move downwards."

    滇东沙倮苗徭等族热烈欢迎解放军
    【新华社西南前线二十六日电】人民解放军某部在向云南省进军途中，受到了云南东部的沙族、倮族、苗族、徭族同胞的热诚支援和欢迎。沙、倮、苗、徭各族同胞在大军到来之前便纷纷参加当地人民组织的迎军慰劳队、民工队，进行筹粮、修路等工作。解放军进入云南省境后，他们便纷纷下山迎接大军。住在大道旁的沙族人民在大军必经的道路上设立了许多茶水站，五十多岁的老太婆也扶着孩子爬上大军路过的大山顶上去烧水。远居在梁山中的生活贫穷的各族人民，也挑着自己的包谷、粟米，翻山越岭，送给人民政府作军粮。富宁附近的龙买村倮族人民特组织了一个舞蹈队到富宁城去欢迎解放军。舞蹈队的农民黄立东说：“这次我们见到天了，往年我们不敢进城，更不敢和军队说话，如今解放军到来，衙门内也可以走，同志们待我们像兄弟一样，给了好多东西，这是我们倮族第一次遇到的好军队。”滇边九龙山的苗徭人民也相继下山，将自己喂养的鸡子和牛带来劳军。沿着大路居住的少数民族，组织了十余个大小的骡马运输站。有些地方的少数民族并帮助军队到几十里远的山间去买蔬菜。各族人民纷纷向解放军控诉国民党反动派抽丁、征粮和重重税捐等剥削压迫的罪行。迎接解放军的苗族代表陶德正说：“过去在国民党百捐万税下，使我们过着‘桃花三月三，苗子把家搬’的悲惨生活。如今我们见了共产党，变了天了，往日向上搬，今天向下搬。”
