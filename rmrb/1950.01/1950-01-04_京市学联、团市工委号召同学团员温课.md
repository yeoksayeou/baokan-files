Beijing News: The Beijing Student Federation and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued a letter to university and middle school students and school Youth League members, calling for reviewing lessons. The text is as follows:

Comrades students, Youth League members in schools:

Happy New Year and progress to all! In 1949, we made great achievements in our studies and great progress in our thinking. 1950 will be the year of complete liberation for the whole country. In addition to excitement and joy, we must study even harder in order to play a greater role in the great cause of restoring and building our people's country. The winter vacation is approaching, and this semester is coming to an end. We should work hard to review our lessons under the guidance of teachers and make further progress in mastering knowledge.

(1) From now on, all unnecessary extracurricular activities should be reduced as much as possible. Those that can be suspended should be suspended. Meetings that are not related to coursework should be reduced or suspended as much as possible. Save time and concentrate on reviewing your lessons well.

(2) Reviewing lessons is not simply to cope with exams, but mainly to master the content of the course. It is not about rote memorization, but about understanding and being able to apply what you have learned.

(3) It mainly depends on your own efforts, but you can also appropriately organize mutual assistance, research and discuss with each other, and ask teachers for help. However, participation must be voluntary, not forced or reluctant. (The "collective scoring system" that has been found in individual schools, that is, the method of leveling the scores within a group or similar methods, is incorrect and should be stopped.)

Comrades students, Youth League members in schools! Strive to master knowledge and learn the scientific skills to serve the people!

    京市学联、团市工委号召同学团员温课
    【北京讯】北京市学生联合会及中国新民主主义青年团北京市工作委员会，为号召温课，发表给大、中学同学及学校青年团员的信。原文如下：同学们，学校中的青年团员们：
    祝贺大家新年进步！一九四九年我们学习有很大的成绩，思想也有很大的进步。一九五○年将是全国完全解放的一年，我们除了兴奋愉快，还必须学习的更好，才能在恢复与建设我们人民国家的伟大事业中起更大的作用。寒假即将到来，本学期即将结束，我们应该在学校师长指导下努力温课，把课业温习得更好，在掌握知识上更前进一步。
    （一）自即日起，凡不必要的课外活动，应该尽量减少。凡可以暂停的则暂停进行。凡与课业无关的会议尽量少开或停开。节省时间，集中精力，温好功课。
    （二）温课不是单纯为了应付考试，主要是为了掌握课程内容。不是生吞活剥，而是要学懂了、会运用。
    （三）主要是自己努力，也可适当组织互助，互相研究、讨论，请教师帮助。但必须得到参加者的自愿，不能强迫，不能勉强。（曾经在个别学校发现的“集体得分制”，即一组之内把分数拉平或类似的办法，是不正确的，应该停止。）
    同学们，学校中的青年团员们！为掌握知识，学习为人民服务的科学技能而努力！
