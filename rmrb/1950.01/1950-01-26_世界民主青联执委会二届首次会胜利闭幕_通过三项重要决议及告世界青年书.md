Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 25th: According to reports from TASS and the Romanian News Agency: The first meeting of the Second Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which began on the 17th of this month in Bucharest, victoriously concluded on the 21st. The meeting passed a resolution on the World Federation of Democratic Youth's struggle to defend the rights of children, a resolution on the report regarding the struggle of Italian democratic youth for peace and political and economic rights, a resolution on the attitude towards the leadership of the "People's Youth of Yugoslavia," and an open letter from the World Federation of Democratic Youth to support the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress.

	Resolution on the Struggle to Defend the Rights of Children
	In its resolution on the struggle to defend the rights of children, the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth describes the tragic situation of children in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries, who are deprived of education, starve, are forced to work, suffer social and racial discrimination, and experience increasing infant mortality rates; condemns the crimes of imperialism in exploiting children; and emphasizes that the struggle for children's rights is an indispensable part of the struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and the bright future of the younger generation. To this end, the Executive Committee calls on all national youth organizations and all democrats to organize powerful demonstrations to defend children, defend peace, and oppose the American and British warmongers, protest the atrocities against children in colonial wars, and demand an immediate end to the wars and the implementation of child health protection laws and the democratization of education. The Executive Committee's resolution concludes by calling on the world's democratic youth organizations to actively participate in the celebration of International Children's Day—June 1, 1950 (previously misidentified as July 1)—and suggests that, together with the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Women's International Democratic Federation, they jointly organize an international conference in the summer of 1950 to discuss children's health and democratic education.

	Resolution on the Report of the Struggle of Italian Democratic Youth
	The Executive Committee's resolution on the report of the struggle of Italian democratic youth points out that the political and economic expansion of Wall Street tycoons has led to the loss of Italian national independence, economic collapse, and the comprehensive impoverishment and increased unemployment of the broad working people. The resolution calls on Italian democratic youth to unite more closely around the World Federation of Democratic Youth and, together with all the Italian people, continue the struggle against the American and British warmongers and the anti-people policies of the Gasperi government. The Executive Committee also suggests that national youth organizations in capitalist countries strengthen the unity of action with all democratic forces in their countries, especially with the actions of trade unions, women's organizations, and student organizations.

	Resolution on the Attitude Towards the Leadership of the "People's Youth of Yugoslavia"
	The Executive Committee's resolution on the attitude towards the leadership of the "People's Youth of Yugoslavia" states: The leadership of the "People's Youth of Yugoslavia," pursuing the anti-people and criminal policies of the Tito clique, attempting to carry out divisive and destructive activities within the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students, and slandering the leaders of the world peace camp—the Soviet Union and Soviet youth—cannot represent the interests and wishes of the democratic youth of Yugoslavia in the slightest. The Executive Committee has decided to sever relations with it and welcomes the youth representatives of Yugoslav revolutionary exiles to participate in the leadership bodies of the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

	In an open letter to the world's youth, the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth calls on all young people around the world, as well as all national, regional, and local youth organizations, to actively support the peace proposals made by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress to the parliaments of all countries last December—to stop the arms race, ban atomic weapons, stop the anti-people colonial wars, and stop suppressing those who support peace; and to demand that the parliaments of those countries adopt them.

    世界民主青联执委会二届首次会胜利闭幕
    通过三项重要决议及告世界青年书
    【新华社北京二十五日电】综合塔斯社、罗马尼亚通讯社消息：本月十七日起，在布加勒斯特举行的世界民主青年联盟二届执行委员会第一次会议，已于二十一日胜利闭幕。会议通过了世界青联为保卫儿童权利而斗争的决议，关于意大利民主青年为争取和平与政治与经济权利而斗争的报告的决议，关于对“南斯拉夫人民青年”领导机构的态度的决议，和世界青联为支持世界和平大会常设委员会而发表的告世界青年书。
            为保卫儿童权利而斗争的决议
    世界青联执委会在其为保卫儿童权利而斗争的决议中，叙述资本主义国家以及殖民地和附属国家中儿童失学、挨饿、被迫劳动、遭受社会歧视与种族歧视，和婴儿死亡率增加的悲惨情况；斥责帝国主义剥削儿童的罪行；并着重指出，争取儿童权利的斗争是争取和平、民主、民族独立与青年一代美好将来的斗争的不可或缺的部分。执委会为此号召所属各全国性青年团体及一切民主分子，为保卫儿童、保卫和平、反对美英战争贩子而组织强有力的示威，抗议殖民战争中对儿童的暴行，要求立即停止战争，实行儿童健康保护法及教育民主化。执委会决议最后号召世界民主青年组织，积极参加国际儿童节——一九五○年六月一日（前误为七月一日）的庆祝，并建议与世界工联和国际妇联在一九五○年夏季，共同组织一个讨论儿童健康与民主教育的国际代表会议。
            关于意大利民主青年斗争的报告的决议
    执委会关于意大利民主青年斗争的报告的决议指出，华尔街大亨们的政治与经济的扩张，造成意大利民族独立的丧失，经济崩溃，广大劳动人民的全面贫穷化和失业的增加。决议号召意大利民主青年更紧密地团结在世界民主青联的周围，与意大利全体人民一道，继续进行反对美英战争贩子和加斯贝利政府反人民政策的斗争。执委会并建议各资本主义国家内全国性的青年组织，加强与他们国家内一切民主力量的行动的统一，特别是和工会、妇女、学生组织的行动的统一。
            关于与“南斯拉夫人民青年”领导机构的态度的决议
    执委会关于对“南斯拉夫人民青年”领导机构的态度的决议称：“南斯拉夫人民青年”领导机构，奉行铁托集团反人民的罪恶政策，试图在世界民主青联和国际学联中进行挑拨离间的破坏活动，并且诽谤世界和平阵营的领袖——苏联和苏联的青年，丝毫不能代表南斯拉夫民主青年的利益和意愿。执委会决定与之断绝关系，并表示欢迎南斯拉夫革命流亡者的青年代表，参加世界民主青联的各领导机构。
    世界民主青联执委会在告世界青年书中，号召全世界青年以及一切全国性的、区域性的、与地方性的青年团体，积极支持世界和平大会常设委员会去年十二月向各国国会提出的和平建议——停止军备竞赛，禁止原子武器，停止反人民的殖民战争，停止镇压拥护和平者；并要求各该国国会予以采纳。
