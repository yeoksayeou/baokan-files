On "The Iniquity Cannot Suppress the Just"
Zhao Shuli

After my "The Iniquity Cannot Suppress the Just" was published, I have read six articles (note) discussing this work – some critical, some defending. I am grateful for all of them and don't want to say anything more. When an article is published, if people are willing to offer opinions, it means they value the work. The author accepts the opinions they think are correct, and doesn't have to accept the ones they think are incorrect. People don't force you anyway, so why bother arguing? Besides, even if you yourself think it's wrong, it's often because your article is not thorough enough; otherwise, why would people have different views (except for reactionary opinions, of course)?

Recently, a comrade advised me to write a general response to give readers my own explanation. I am willing to give readers my own explanation, but there is no need to comment on each of the six articles one by one. I will only write down my original intention in writing that work and some necessary explanations below as a reference for readers.

My intention in writing that work was "to write about the various experiences and lessons of the entire land reform process at that time and in that place, so that cadres and the masses in the land reform would know what to pursue and what to avoid."

The entire land reform process at that time and in that place can be briefly introduced as follows:

	I. Before the land reform, feudal forces occupied a dominant position, and hooligans acted as the henchmen of the landlords, bullying the masses by flaunting their power. The poor and hired peasants were of course suppressed, and the middle peasants were also often affected.

	II. In the early stage of the land reform, the feudal forces were weakened, but their remaining power had not yet disappeared. At this time, the performance of other classes was very complex: ① The middle peasants were indecisive and waited and watched. ② Some of the active elements and cadres among the poor peasants benefited from dividing the fruits. ③ The general poor peasants were generally considered to have turned over, but they were not valued politically and had little opportunity to participate in political life. ④ Some poor peasants were forgotten and continued to live their poor lives. ⑤ Hooligans took advantage of loopholes to make some ill-gotten gains, but politically they were trying to play both sides.

	III. The higher authorities discovered that the forgotten masses had not turned over, and investigated the reason. The cadres and active elements who had divided more of the fruits only said that the feudal forces still had remnants, and did not mention that they had taken more of the fruits themselves. Therefore, they only decided to investigate the remaining feudal property. During the investigation, a few cadres who had benefited knew that the amount of remaining feudal property was very pitiful, and were afraid that it would not solve the problem of the forgotten poor peasants, so they wanted to include the wealthy middle peasants in the feudal forces. The hooligans were even happier to muddy the waters, fearing that the world would not be in chaos. The combination of these two took the upper hand, and the upright cadres became a minority. The masses had no chance to speak. As a result, the remaining feudal forces were indeed overthrown, but the middle peasants were also implicated, and everyone was in danger, unwilling to live their lives, and production was also stalled.

	IV. The so-called "correction of deviations" is to correct the above phenomena. The specific process is to investigate and clarify the responsibility for errors, educate party members, cadres, and the masses, stabilize people's hearts, and put rural work back on the right track.

The overall process of land reform in that place was roughly like this. When I wrote that work, I focused on the incorrect cadres and hooligans, and at the same time, I wanted to explain how the wronged middle peasants felt, so I wrote about Xiao Chang, Xiao Dan, and Jucai in more detail. According to my experience, the most difficult thing to guard against in land reform is hooligans taking advantage of loopholes: because hooligans are poor people, their status is easily confused with that of poor peasants. In the early stage of land reform, the honest and kind poor peasants had already been worn down by feudal pressure and did not dare to come forward easily without considerable encouragement; the middle peasants had many concerns and often had to take a wait-and-see attitude for a period of time; only the hooligans were unscrupulous, and as long as there was a little immediate benefit, they could go to either side. These people are basically poor people. If they are willing to stand on the side of the masses to oppose the feudal forces, the leadership should naturally not refuse, but they should be educated in the movement, gradually overcome their hooligan nature, and honestly become new people. It is absolutely not possible to appoint them as cadres before they are transformed, so that they have the opportunity to exert their hooligan nature. Unfortunately, that place did not recognize this point in the initial land reform, which led to hooligans mixing into the cadres and active elements, still flaunting their power over the masses. Secondly, when the masses are not fully mobilized, a few cadres in power are prone to becoming corrupt: the new village-level cadres who are promoted in the movement, if they do not have regular education and do not have enough mass power to supervise them, are easily prone to going astray, because all the former power holders were bad examples, and learning a little bit of it can be profitable. I think these two things are the two key points that should be paid the most attention to in land reform. If you relax a little, you will suffer losses in your work.

The reason why I incorporated a love story is because I wanted to use a little skill in writing. If I were to write directly about fighting the local tyrants, the poor people turning over, a few people taking more of the fruits and leaving behind poor holes, the second investigation implicating the middle peasants, all the way to party rectification and correction of deviations, the length would increase, and it would easily become formulaic. Therefore, I thought of a simple method to string everything mentioned above together with a love story, so that my expected main audience (cadres and the masses in the land reform) could give due love and hate to the land reform work at each stage and the people who participated in the work from reading this love story.

Whether Xiao Bao and Ruan Ying objectively played any role, subjectively I did not regard them as the main characters – for example, Liu Xiyuan and his son, Jucai, Second Aunt, Xi'en, Xiao Si, Anfa, Lao Guai, Xiao Chang, Xiao Dan, etc., whether in detail or in brief, I clearly gave them social representativeness. Only for these two people, Xiao Bao can barely represent non-powerful small cadres (only temporarily appointed), and Ruan Ying, in addition to having a love relationship with Xiao Bao, I did not intend to have her represent any aspect.

This story is incorporated, but it is not an interlude, but it is used as a rope – putting everything I want to explain on it, but not treating it as the main part. When I wrote "Li Youcai's Rhymes," I used Li Youcai in this way, and this time I used Ruan Ying and Xiao Bao again. I have not seen many other people use this method, and I dare not think of it as any skill. I just secretly use it for convenience, and I don't plan to use it again in the future.

I have said a lot in a rambling way, still talking about my subjective intentions and arrangements. As for how far the objective effect differs from the subjective wish, I cannot draw an accurate conclusion for a while. Although the authors of those six articles have all participated in land reform, they are all talking about the jargon of our literary circles when writing these articles, while my expected main audience, in addition to someone who sent me a letter, I have not had the opportunity to learn more about the feelings of more people after reading it, so I am not sure what the general effect is. However, my view does not mean that I despise inside information. My emphasis on inside information exceeds my emphasis on the opinions of the general public, because the feelings of insiders are more敏銳 than outsiders. The fact that my theme and protagonists have been able to cause controversy among insiders can at least prove that I have not written it clearly, which has led to some different views, right? Isn't this the help of insiders? The reason why I cannot draw a conclusion from this is that I am just afraid that the focus is different. For example, when making a cotton-padded coat, a tailor often criticizes that the cotton in front of the chest is thicker, or the hem is wider... None of these opinions are not worth paying attention to. If you find that people are indeed right, you can do better next time. However, you cannot conclude from this that the cotton-padded coat is completely unusable or just right. When the person wearing the cotton-padded coat puts it on, if you ask him how it is, and he only says that it is not good to hold his chest or that the waist is a little loose, then it is still barely wearable; if he says that he cannot put it on or that it is very cool to wear, then it is considered a complete failure.

Let my answer be like this!

In addition, I must write a statement: My work was published in the mountains. At that time, the various liberated areas had not yet been connected into one piece, and the reprints were circulated, some of which were so wrong that no one could understand them. I hope readers will not count it on my account.

### 关于《邪不压正》

    关于《邪不压正》
    赵树理
    我的《邪不压正》发表了之后，先后读到了六篇（注）谈这篇东西的文章——其中也有批评的，也有辩护的，我读了都很感谢，不想再说什么。一篇文章发表出去，有人愿意提出意见，也是重视这篇作品；其所提的意见，作者认为对的就接受下来，认为不对的不用接受算了，人家又不强迫，何必再去声辩？况且即使自己认为不对，往往也是自己的文章有不周到之处，否则为什么会使人家发生不同的观感呢（反动者的意见自然除外）？
    最近有个同志劝我写个总的答复，使读者得到我自己一个解答。使读者得到我自己一个解答我愿意，但也不必去把那六篇文章逐一评论一番。我只把我写那篇东西原来的意图和某些必要说明的安排写在下面作为读者一个参考。
    我写那篇东西的意图是“想写出当时当地土改全部过程中的各种经验教训，使土改中的干部和群众读了知所趋避”。
    当时当地的土改全部过程，简单介绍如下：
    一、在土改之前，封建势力占统治地位，流氓甘作地主之爪牙，狐假虎威欺压群众。贫雇农固然有接受其压制，中农亦常被波及。
    二、发动土改之初期，封建势力受到削弱，但余威尚未消失。这时候其他各阶层之表现甚为复杂：①中农因循观望。②贫农中之积极分子和干部，有一部分在分果实中占到便宜。③一般贫农大体上也算翻了身，只是政治上未被重视，多没有参加政治生活的机会。④有一部分贫农竟被遗忘，仍过他的穷苦生活。⑤流氓钻空子发了点横财，但在政治上则两面拉关系。
    三、上级发现了被遗忘了的群众没有翻身，追查其原因，多分了果实的干部和积极分子只说是封建势力尚有残余，而没有说到自己多占了一部分果实，所以只决定了追究残存的封建财产。在追究时，少数占了便宜的干部明知残存的封建财产数目很可怜，怕解决不了被遗忘的贫农的问题，就想把富裕的中农也算到封建势力中去。流氓更喜的是混水摸鱼，惟恐天下不乱。这两下一结合，就占了上风，正派干部反成了少数，群众没有说话的机会，结果残余的封建势力固然被打倒了，而中农也因受了连累，人人自危，无心再过日子，生产也因之停顿。
    四、所谓“纠偏”，就是纠正上述现象，其具体过程是追清了错误责任，教育了党员、干部和群众，安定了人心，使农村工作重新走上正轨。
    那地方的土改总过程大体如此。我在写那篇东西的时候把重点放在不正确的干部和流氓上，同时又想说明受了冤枉的中农作何观感，故对小昌、小旦和聚财写得比较突出一点。据我的经验，土改中最不易防范的是流氓钻空子：因为流氓是穷人，其身分很容易和贫农相混。在土改初期，忠厚的贫农，早在封建压力之下折了锐气，不经过相当时期鼓励不敢轻易出头：中农顾虑多端，往往要抱一个时期的观望态度；只有流氓毫无顾忌，只要眼前有点小利，向着那一方面也可以。这种人基本上也是穷人，如果愿意站在大众这方面来反对封建势力，领导方面自然也不应拒绝，但在运动中要加以教育，逐渐克服了他的流氓根性，使他老老实实作个新人，而绝不可在未改造之前任为干部，使其有发挥流氓性的机会。可惜那地方在初期土改中没有认清这一点，致使流氓混入干部和积极分子群中，仍在群众头上抖威风。其次是群众未充分发动起来的时候，少数当权的干部容易变坏：在运动中提拔起来的村级新干部，要是既没有经常的教育，又没有足够监督他的群众力量，品质稍差一点就容易往不正确的路上去，因为过去所有的当权者尽是些坏榜样，稍学一点就有利可图。我以为这两件事是土改中最应该注意的两个重点，稍一放松，工作上便要吃亏。
    我所以套进去个恋爱故事，是因为想在行文上讨一点巧。要是正面写斗争恶霸、穷人翻身、少数人多占了果实留下穷苦窟隆、二次追究连累了中农，一直写到整党、纠偏、篇幅既要增长，又容易公式化，所以我便想了个简便的方法，把上述一切用一个恋爱故事连串起来，使我预期的主要读者对象（土改中的干部和群众）从读这一恋爱故事中，对那各阶段的土改工作和参加工作的人都给以应有的爱憎。
    小宝和软英这两个人，不论客观上起的是什么作用，在主观上我是没有把他两个当作主人翁的——例如刘锡元父子、聚财、二姨、锡恩、小四、安发、老拐、小昌、小旦等人，或详或略，我都明确地给他们以社会代表性，独对于这两个人，小宝免强还可以代表不当权的小干部（也只是临时加委的），软英则除与小宝有恋爱关系之外，我没有准备叫她代表任何一方面。
    这个故事是套进去的，但并不是一种穿插，而是把它当作一条绳子来用——把我要说明的事情都挂在它身上，可又不把它当成主要部分。我在写“李有才板话”的时候，曾以这样的态度来用李有才，这次又用了一下软英和小宝。这种办法，我没有多见别人用过，我也不敢自以为是一种什么手法，只是为了方便起见偷偷用一下算了，以后也没有准备再用。
    拉拉杂杂说了好多，仍说的是自己主观上的意图和安排，至于客观效果与主观愿望相差多远，我一时还得不出准确的结论。那大小六篇文章的作者虽然都参加过土改，但在写这些文章的时候又都说的是我们文艺界的本行话，而我所期望的主要读者对象，除了有人给我来过一封信之外，我还没有机会了解到更多一些人的读后感，因此还断不定一般效果如何。不过我这种看法绝没有轻视内行话的意思。我对内行话的重视要超过对一般读者意见的重视，因为内行的感觉是要比外行敏锐的。我的主题及主人翁已经能在内行中引起争论，至少也可以证明是自己没有把它写明确以至于引起些不同的看法吧？这还不是内行的帮助吗？其所以不能因此作出结论者，我只是怕所看的重点不同。比方作一件棉衣，一个裁缝批评起来，往往是说胸前的棉花厚了些，或下摆宽了些……这些意见没有一条不值得重视如果发现人家确实说得对，下次就能做得更好一点，然而却不能因此就断定那件棉衣根本要不得或者恰合适，等到穿棉衣的穿上去，你问他怎么样，他如果只说不好挺胸脯或腰松一点，那就还马马虎虎能穿；如果他说穿不上或者说穿上很凉快，那就算吹到底了。
    我的答复就如此吧！
    此外，我还须写一点声明：我那篇东西是在山里发表的，那时候各个解放区还没有连成一片，各地辗转翻印，有些竟错得一塌糊涂，谁也读不通，希望读者不要算到我的账上。
