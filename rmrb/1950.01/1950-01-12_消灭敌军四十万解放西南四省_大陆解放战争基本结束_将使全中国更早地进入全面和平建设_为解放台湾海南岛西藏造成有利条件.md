Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 10th: A frontline reporter summarized the liberation of the Southwest and the annihilation of Hu Zongnan's main force, stating: In order to realize the complete liberation of the country, with the coordinated and victorious advance of our East China, South China, and Northwest battlefields, the powerful forces of our People's Liberation Army's First, Second, and Fourth Field Armies launched the campaign to advance into the Southwest and annihilate the main force of the Hu Zongnan bandit troops and other remnants of the Kuomintang forces. This campaign was launched on November 1st and victoriously concluded on December 29th, lasting 59 days. In these 59 days, the Kuomintang army in the Southwest, including the uprising troops, suffered a total loss of over 400,000 men. Our army liberated the entirety of Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, and the last dozens of counties in western Hubei, western Hunan, southern Shaanxi, and southern Gansu. Due to the uprisings of Generals Lu Han, Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, and Pan Wenhua, Yunnan and Xikang provinces were declared peacefully liberated. This is another great victory for the Chinese people. Because of this victory, all the provinces in the Southwest, except for Tibet, have been liberated, and the mainland liberation war in China has basically come to a victorious end. This victory will enable the country to enter a comprehensive and peaceful construction phase sooner. This victory creates more favorable conditions for the future liberation of Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet.

On the thousand-mile battlefront from the Yangtze River in the north to the border between Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou in the south, the People's Liberation Army launched a powerful offensive from western Hubei and western Hunan towards Sichuan and Guizhou provinces in early November. The southern route of the Liberation Army first entered Guizhou through Zhijiang area of western Hunan, liberated Guiyang on November 15th, and took advantage of the victory to develop towards Zunyi in northern Guizhou, Bijie in northwestern Guizhou, and Pu'an in southwestern Guizhou, pursuing and annihilating the fleeing enemy in three routes, quickly liberating most of Guizhou, and cutting off the retreat route of hundreds of thousands of remnant Kuomintang bandit troops in the Sichuan-Shaanxi-Gansu area towards Yunnan and Guizhou.

At the same time, our army advancing westward from the Yichang area and the Changde area respectively cleared the remnants of bandits in Badong and Enshi in western Hubei and Fenghuang and Yongshui in western Hunan, and then marched victoriously into Sichuan. The Liberation Army advancing from Enshi in western Hubei and Yongshui area in western Hunan successively liberated Youyang, Xiushan, Qianjiang, Pengshui, and other important gateways in southeastern Sichuan in mid-November, and quickly crossed the natural barrier of Wujiang River, annihilating more than 50,000 bandits along the way. After liberating Pengshui, except for a part of the Liberation Army heading north to Wulong and Fuling, and crossing the river to clear the remnant bandits on both sides of the Yangtze River in eastern Sichuan, liberating strongholds such as Fengdu, Changshou, Dianjiang, and Guang'an, and tailing Sun Zhen's bandit troops towards the Suining area, the main force continued to advance westward, crossed Nanchuan, and joined forces with the large army that had advanced northward from Guiyang, successively capturing Xifeng, Zunyi, Tongzi, and Qijiang, and on November 27th and 28th, captured Jiangjin, Shunjiangchang, Yudongzhen and other outposts of Chongqing, and then crossed the Yangtze River in the above-mentioned areas, and liberated Chongqing, the capital of the Southwest, on the 30th. At this time, the Chiang bandits, on the one hand, used the remnants of Song Xilian's and Luo Guangwen's corps and Sun Zhen's bandit troops from the Sichuan-Hubei Pacification Headquarters to delay our army's advance towards Chengdu on the front, and on the other hand, hurriedly transferred Hu's main force from the Qinling Mountains and southeastern Gansu to the vicinity of Chengdu, attempting to resist our army and break through to Xikang and Yunnan to preserve the last backbone force on the mainland, waiting for the outbreak of the so-called "Third World War" to make a comeback.

After the liberation of Chongqing, our army continued to pursue the remnant bandits along the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway towards Chengdu. A part of the army swept away the remnant enemies in the Tongliang, Tongnan, and Suining areas to the north. The offensive of the Liberation Army advancing along the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway was unstoppable, and it quickly advanced to the Longchang, Neijiang, and Zizhong line, liberating Jianyang, an important area southeast of Chengdu, on the 15th. At the same time, another route of the Liberation Army liberated Bijie in northwestern Guizhou on November 28th and pointed north, and on December 3rd, they successively liberated Xuyong and Luzhou, the north and south strongholds of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and on the 6th, won over the 72nd Army of the Kuomintang army stationed in Yibin, led by Guo Rugui, to revolt, and advanced along the Lu-Le Highway in two routes to Qianwei and Leshan, and successively captured Zigong, Rongxian, Leshan, Emei, and Pengshan before the 20th, and liberated Qionglai and Dayi west of Chengdu, cutting off Hu's escape route to Xikang. This route of our army and the main force advancing westward along the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway formed a pincer attack on Hu Zongnan's bandit troops in Chengdu.

At this time, a unit of our First Field Army that had departed from southern Shaanxi and southern Gansu moved south at lightning speed, successively capturing Guangyuan, Jiange, and Mianyang, and quickly reached the Guanghan area on the outskirts of Chengdu and its east-west line, and at this point, the large encirclement circle of our army from the north and south to encircle and annihilate Hu's bandits was finally formed. The surrounded remnant enemies faced the steep cliffs of the Qionglai Mountains to the west, with no way to escape.

Under the powerful and victorious offensive of our army and the repeated sincere advice and appeals of Generals He Long, Liu Bocheng, and Deng Xiaoping, Liu Wenhui, Chairman of the Kuomintang Xikang Province, Deng Xihou and Pan Wenhua, Deputy Commanders of the Southwest Military and Political Affairs, Dong Zongheng, Deputy Director of the Sichuan-Hubei Pacification Headquarters, Cao Suyuan, Deputy Commander of the 16th Corps, Luo Guangwen, Commander of the 15th Corps, Chen Kefei, Commander of the 20th Corps, and other army and division commanders successively led their troops to revolt from December 9th to 26th, announcing their secession from the reactionary camp and standing on the side of the people. The besieged Hu bandits became increasingly isolated.

On December 23rd, after the bandit leader Hu Zongnan fled to Taipei from Guanghan, the three corps under his command began to break through along the Sichuan-Xikang Highway towards Ya'an and Xichang. However, when their vanguard reached the line from Qionglai, Pujiang, and Xinjin to the south of Chengdu, they were completely trapped in our large encirclement circle. After three days of encirclement and annihilation operations from the 25th to the 27th, the entire 5th Corps of bandits was annihilated, and Li Wen, the commander of the 5th Corps of bandits, was captured alive. Li Zhen, commander of the 18th Corps, and Pei Changhui, commander of the 7th Corps, led their troops to launch a battlefield uprising in Damianpu southeast of Chengdu and Jintang and Guanghan northeast of Chengdu. At this point, the besieged bandits were completely resolved. The People's Liberation Army liberated Chengdu on the 27th. In addition, the 19th Army and the 49th Army under the 19th Corps of the Kuomintang in southwestern Guizhou and other local armed forces also revolted successively from December 10th under the leadership of Wang Boxun, commander of the corps, Zhang Tao, commander of the 89th Army, and Wang Jinyuan, commander of the 49th Army, and the entire territory of Guizhou was also completely liberated. At this point, the Southwest Campaign basically came to a victorious conclusion.

Since the People's Liberation Army launched its offensive from Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Gansu, the farthest advance was three to four thousand miles, unfolding a brave, swift, continuous, and non-stop forced march, overcoming all kinds of difficulties such as the dangerous passes and mountains of northern and southern Sichuan, continuous wind and snow, and muddy paths. The commanders and fighters bravely advanced under the slogan "Who are the heroes, let's see in difficulties." On the Sichuan-Hunan Highway west of Pengshui, there were sparse crowds, and the army pursued the fleeing enemy day and night in the rain, and often six or seven units of troops marched side by side on one highway. Under the rapid and brave advance of the People's Liberation Army, the remnant bandits were terrified and fled in panic. The people along the pursuit line, although suffered from the fleeing bandit army's vicious burning and looting, all boiled water, vacated houses, repaired bridges and roads, and warmly welcomed and supported the People's Liberation Army when it arrived. The minority compatriots in western Hunan, eastern Guizhou, and northwestern Sichuan also showed unparalleled enthusiasm. When the roads were muddy, they paved them with straw; when it was dark, they lit torches to illuminate the road, allowing the army to advance smoothly and powerfully supporting the liberation of the Southwest campaign, achieving a swift and great victory.

    消灭敌军四十万解放西南四省
    大陆解放战争基本结束
    将使全中国更早地进入全面和平建设  为解放台湾海南岛西藏造成有利条件
    【新华社西南前线十日电】前线记者综述大西南解放和胡宗南主力被歼的经过称：为实现全国彻底解放，在我华东、华南、西北各战场协同一致，胜利进军的形势下，我人民解放军第一、第二、第四三大野战军各有力部队，发动了进军西南，歼灭胡宗南匪部主力和其他国民党残余部队的作战。这一战役于十一月一日发起，十二月二十九日胜利结束，为时五十九天。在这五十九天中，西南的国民党军，连同起义部队在内，共损失四十余万人。我军解放川黔两省全部，和鄂西、湘西、陕南、甘南最后的几十座县城，滇、康两省，由于卢汉、刘文辉、邓锡侯、潘文华四将军的起义而宣告和平解放。这是中国人民又一个巨大的胜利。由于这个胜利，大西南诸省，除西藏一地外，已全获解放，中国大陆解放战争基本上胜利结束。这个胜利将使全国更早地进入全面和平的建设。这个胜利给今后解放台湾、海南岛、西藏创造了更为有利的条件。
    在北起长江、南至湘桂黔边境千里战线上人民解放军于十一月初从鄂西和湘西向大西南的川黔两省发动强大攻势。南路解放军首于湘西芷江地区进入贵州，于十一月十五日解放贵阳，并乘胜向黔北遵义、黔西北毕节、黔西南普安发展，三路追歼逃敌，迅速将贵州大部解放，切断了川陕甘地区内数十万残余国民党匪军向滇黔的退路。
    与此同时，由宜昌地区与常德地区西进的我军分别肃清鄂西巴东、恩施和湘西凤凰、永绥等地残匪后即乘胜挺入四川。自鄂西溯江而上的解放军先后解放巫山、巫溪、奉节、云阳及川东重要商埠万县和开江、梁山、大竹等地。自鄂西之恩施与湘西永绥地区进入四川的解放军则于十一月中旬连克川东南重要门户酉阳、秀山、黔江、彭水一线，并迅速跨越乌江天险，沿途歼匪达五万余人。解放彭水后，解放军除一部北上武隆、涪陵，并渡江肃清川东长江两岸残匪解放酆都、长寿、垫江、广安等据点，尾追孙震匪部向遂宁地区前进外，主力则继续西进，越过南川，与由贵阳北上连克息烽、遵义、桐梓、綦江的大军会师，并于十一月二十七、二十八两日攻克重庆外围据点江津、顺江场、渔洞镇等地，随即于上述各地横渡长江，一举于三十日解放西南首府重庆。此时，蒋匪一面以宋希濂、罗广文两兵团残部及川鄂绥署孙震匪部在正面迟滞我军向成都之推进，一面仓皇把胡匪主力由秦岭山区及甘肃东南调集成都附近，企图抵抗我军，并向西康、云南突围逃窜，以保全其在大陆上最后一支基干力量，作等待爆发所谓“第三次世界大战”时卷土重来之迷梦。
    重庆解放后，我大军续沿成渝公路向成都猛追残匪。一部则向北扫荡铜梁、潼南、遂宁地区残敌。沿成渝公路前进的解放军攻势势如破竹，迅即进至隆昌、内江、资中一线，十五日解放成都东南要地简阳。与此同时，另路解放军于十一月二十八日解放贵州西北部的毕节后挥戈北指，到十二月三日即先后解放长江上游南北据点叙永、泸州，六日争取驻宜宾之国民党军七十二军郭汝隗部起义，并沿泸乐公路分两路向犍为、乐山前进，于二十日前连克自贡、荣县、乐山、峨嵋、彭山，并解放成都以西之邛崃、大邑等城，截断胡匪入康逃路。该路我军与沿成渝公路西进大军形成了对成都胡宗南匪部钳击形势。
    此时，自陕南及甘南出动的我第一野战军某部，以迅雷之势分头南下，连克广元、剑阁、绵阳，迅速到达成都外围广汉及其东西之线，至此南北我军从三面围歼胡匪之大包围圈即最后形成。被围残敌西临邛崃山脉之崇岭峻壁，毫无逃路。
    在我军强大胜利攻势与贺龙、刘伯承、邓小平诸将军再三忠告号召下，国民党西康省主席刘文辉，西南军政副长官邓锡侯、潘文华，川鄂绥署副主任董宗珩，十六兵团副司令曹苏元，十五兵团司令罗广文，二十兵团司令陈克非，及其他军师长等自十二月九日至二十六日先后率部起义，宣布脱离反动阵营，站到人民方面。被围胡匪益形孤立。
    十二月二十三日匪首胡宗南由广汉飞逃台北后，其所辖三个兵团即开始沿川康公路向雅安、西昌方向突围。但当其先头部队行至邛崃、蒲江、新津迄成都以南之线时，即完全陷入我大包围圈内。经二十五日至二十七日三天的围歼作战，全部歼灭匪第五兵团，生擒匪五兵团司令李文。其第十八兵团司令李振、第七兵团裴昌会则在成都东南之大面铺及成都东北之金堂、广汉地区率部举行战场起义。至此，被围之匪即被全部解决。人民解放军并即于二十七日解放成都。此外，贵州西南国民党十九兵团所辖之十九军、四十九军等部与其他地方武装亦在该兵团司令王伯勋、八十九军军长张涛及四十九军军长王锦渊分别率领下于十二月十日起先后起义，贵州全境亦告全部解放。至此，西南战役即基本上胜利结束。
    人民解放军自湘、鄂、陕、甘发动攻势以来，最远的前进了三四千里，展开了勇猛神速连续不停的急行军，克服了川北川南的关山险阻、连绵风雪和泥泞小道等种种困难。指战员们在“谁是英雄好汉，在困难中看”的口号下奋勇前进。在彭水以西川湘公路上人烟稀少，大军日夜冒雨尾追逃敌，常常六七个单位的部队在一条公路上并肩进军。在人民解放军这样神速勇猛的进军下，残匪丧胆，抱头鼠窜。沿途追击线上的各地人民虽遭受了溃逃匪军穷凶极恶的焚烧抢劫，但当人民解放军一到，莫不烧开水、腾房子、修桥铺路，热烈欢迎与支援。湘西、黔东和川西北各地的少数民族同胞同样表现了无比的热情。道路泥泞时，他们用稻草铺路；天黑时，他们燃火把照路，让大军顺利前进，有力地支援了解放大西南战役，获得迅速巨大的胜利。
