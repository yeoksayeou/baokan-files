    From Beijing to Hankou
    Chen Ji
    It takes fifty-three hours by train on the Beijing-Hankou Railway to get from Beijing to Hankou. One thousand two hundred and twelve kilometers—this is a long journey. At each station and section, one can see the traces of restoration and reconstruction. Thanks to the railway workers, the farmers along the line, and the soldiers of the Railway Corps! They have put their hard work and amazing perseverance into this major artery that runs through the center of our country. Three or four years ago, people could not have imagined that the entire Beijing-Hankou line would be open to traffic on New Year's Day this year. At that time, in order to defeat the enemy, the Chinese people had thoroughly destroyed this strategic artery used by the enemy, puppet, and bandit troops to attack the Chinese people countless times. Steel rails and sleepers were buried, most of the bridges were broken into pieces, and many roadbeds were reclaimed by the people for cultivation. After the Chinese people drove away the enemy and liberated the entire Beijing-Hankou Railway, it was fully opened to traffic in less than a year. The Chinese people have created a miracle.
    We still remember the battle to liberate Beijing and Tianjin last year. Railway workers heroically supported the front lines under the slogan "The People's Liberation Army advances, the railway extends!" On the line from Beijing to Changxindian, the First Engineering Team of the Beijing-Baoding Railway Construction Office fought against the severe cold below zero and the ice floes of the Yongding River, and completed the Lugou Bridge three days ahead of schedule. The people along the Beijing-Baoding line still clearly remember the achievements of the First and Second Engineering Teams in repairing the Beijing-Baoding section. At that time, materials were extremely scarce, and the workers searched for materials while laying tracks. The frozen Yongding River contained steel rails. The workers broke the ice and plunged into the river, staying in the water for half a day at a time until all the steel rails were retrieved. When materials were found, there was no coal to transport them by locomotive. The workers took on the task of the locomotive, pulling from the front and pushing from the back. Despite numerous difficulties, they still laid more than ten meters of track per person per day, completing the entire section half a month ahead of schedule. The North and South Juma Rivers converge into a huge current under the North River Bridge, which is one hundred and eighty-three meters wide. Half a year ago, workers stood firm in the bone-chilling water and built the North River Bridge, which is more than four hundred meters long. They used iron bars to break the rocks at the bottom of the river and wedged the bridge piles into the riverbed one by one. Whether under Japanese or Kuomintang rule, workers could drive a maximum of three bridge piles per person per day; now they can drive ten per person per day. Of the nineteen bridge piers of the North River Bridge, nine were destroyed. It would have taken at least half a year to repair it during the Kuomintang era. However, the workers after liberation only took sixty-six days to repair it, twenty days ahead of schedule.
    From Baoding to Shijiazhuang, there are one hundred and thirty-five kilometers of lines, passing through thirteen rivers such as the Tang River, the Sha River, and the Hutuo River, and passing through one hundred and eighteen bridges of various sizes. The degree of destruction on this section of the road was more thorough than that of the Beijing-Baoding section. The People's train departing southward from Baoding encounters the Xin Tang River Bridge, the first large bridge. The workers participating in the bridge repair told me that when they repaired this bridge last year, mountain floods broke out four times. They insisted on working in water that was "neck-deep" every day, and some workers persisted in the water for twenty-four hours. Once, the bridge workers had just erected the pile frame on the north side of the bridge that had been washed down by the river, and the river suddenly surged up, watching the pile frame being washed away again. The workers were anxious and jumped into the water one by one, chasing the piles for four or five miles. Some workers were stunned by the waves, and some choked by the river water. They still kept salvaging the piles until they were all retrieved. In the continuous autumn rain in September, the workers victoriously erected the one hundred and fifty-meter-long Xin Tang River Bridge.
    On the Wukong Bridge (Hutuo River Bridge) in the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section, the following words are still clearly written: "Strive to complete the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section by the October Revolution Day and drive the train to Shijiazhuang!" The road construction heroes rushed to repair the bridge from the north and south ends in September. The trains on the north and south banks of the Wukong River followed behind the line workers, constantly making majestic roars. The staff recalled their feelings at the time to reporters and said: "The train heads on both sides were roaring, and we couldn't wait to finish the repair in one night." They voluntarily worked overtime. In the dark night, seven pile driver frames shone with brilliant lights, and two winches made roaring motor sounds; the workers in the cold water shouted against the wind, suppressing the constant roaring of the Hutuo River. The record of erecting frames increased from seven to twenty-three per day. In the north of Baoding, each person averaged four cubic meters of earthwork per day. In the rush repair of the Wukong Bridge, the unprecedented record of fourteen cubic meters was raised. They built this bridge day and night, forgetting to sleep and eat. The train finally reached Shijiazhuang on the October Revolution Day.
    Shijiazhuang is two hundred and thirty kilometers south to Anyang. This is the last section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway to be started. The entire officers and soldiers of the ×th Detachment of the Railway Corps repaired this section. When passing through Yuanshi, Gaoyi, Xingtai, Handan and other places, the farmers along the way told us stories about the "flying soldiers." Why are they called "flying soldiers"? It means that the officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps repaired roads so quickly that they repaired them in front of them in the blink of an eye. The ××× Line Brigade, which was responsible for rushing to repair the line, once advanced at the highest speed of five kilometers and three hundred and thirty meters per day. Everyone held torches and launched a surprise attack in the middle of the night. At one o'clock in the morning, the citizens of Handan were still asleep, and they quietly repaired the railway past Handan. This incident spread throughout Handan City, and everyone praised it. Jia Qingxiang, political commissar of the ××× Line Brigade, told me that their brigade was newly established. Before they were transferred to work on this line, they had never repaired roads. At the beginning, they had no experience, and seven or eight hundred people only repaired eight hundred meters a day, and everyone was very discouraged. Repeated meetings were held to discuss and change the rush repair method. Until the seventh method was changed, the number of people was reduced to four hundred, and three kilometers and six hundred meters could be repaired every day. This new method of theirs is called "division of labor and responsibility, organic cooperation," and the entire team is divided into four parts: (1) those who carry steel rails and sleepers. Where the sleepers are carried, the steel rails are laid; (2) those who nail the spikes. Where the steel rails are laid, the spikes are nailed; (3) those who repair. Where the train goes, the repairers follow behind, filling up the sleepers, initially aligning and raising the tracks, and tamping; (4) those who repair in large quantities, repair completely according to the standard to ensure the quality of the line. The speed of the train on the Shijiazhuang-Anyang line can reach 40 kilometers per hour. The "flying soldiers" not only achieved "fast" but also "good."
    When I talked with the heroes of the × Detachment about the deeds of repairing roads and building bridges, they said: "We have nothing outstanding. Everyone has a passion, and under the slogan of "No one is allowed to delay anyone," we bury our heads in hard work. In the past, we often heard that bridge engineering was huge, and the time for bridge construction often fell behind the line. The × Detachment overcame this phenomenon. No matter how cold the river water was, they never interrupted the pile driving work, and they were never tired of improving the pile driving method. The ghost face of Jiang Jieshi was painted on the Zhishui bridge piles. Fifty or sixty of them carried a five-hundred-jin iron hammer and hammered it towards Jiang Jieshi. The song "Hum yo! Hum yo! Kill Jiang Jieshi yo, build a new China!" shook the frozen Zhishui River day and night. The prisoners sent by Xingtai County to participate in the bridge repair were deeply moved by their hard-working spirit. They also followed up actively and achieved many rare achievements. At a celebration meeting, the Xingtai prisoners received the award flag given to them by the Railway Corps. The working spirit of the heroes of the × Detachment also educated the lazy people who did not love labor along the way. In Gu's Village in Anyang City, there was a loafer named Gu De who was lazy and did not want to work. The people's government had tried many ways to transform him, but he still did not change. This time he was sent to repair the road, and at first he was still the same. He saw the soldiers working hard in the icy river, and his thinking gradually changed. He said to everyone he met: "How can there be such a troop! After fighting for many years, they still have to work hard to repair roads and build bridges here. We—we must learn from them!" The great spirit of labor educated the loafer—Gu De. Gu De has since become a leading model in the civilian labor team. After the restoration and opening of the Shijiazhuang-Anyang section, Gu De was elected as a labor model at the model evaluation meeting.
    Wherever the train goes, the farmers there watch with joyful eyes. A few months ago, during the busy farming season, they automatically searched for materials and sent out civilian workers to participate in road construction. They handed over the rails and sleepers buried during the Anti-Japanese War. They dispatched thousands upon thousands of carts to transport railway equipment. Most of the materials used for this thousand-mile-long Beijing-Hankou Road relied on them. Comrade Meng Xianzhang, who once led the restoration of the Beijing-Baoding and Baoding-Shijiazhuang sections, told me, "If we are to reward merits for the successful opening of the Beijing-Hankou Road, the villagers should be counted as first." The line from Baoding to Shijiazhuang is more than 130 kilometers long, and the villagers handed over 27,000 steel rails, excluding miscellaneous rails and curved rails, which can be used to lay 110 kilometers of lines. That is to say, 80% of the steel rails in the entire section were donated by the farmers. The soldiers of the Railway Corps who quickly repaired the Shijiazhuang-Anyang section told reporters: "Wherever we repair the railway, the villagers there will send us a large number of vegetables and comfort items. The women in the villages near the railway also voluntarily organized sewing teams to sew and wash clothes for us. When we repaired to Gaoyi City, the villagers spontaneously invited us to hold a get-together, and they gave us many pennants at the meeting. The villagers in Yuanshi County collected more than 5,000 steel rails and more than 4,000 spikes for us. When we repaired the railway to Yuanshi County, the whole county was filled with gongs and drums, and the villagers went to our troops to express their condolences. They also spontaneously organized to strictly protect the railway along the line. We will never forget the help of the villagers." When the train arrived in Hankou, the images of the farmers who used to drive ox carts day and night on the Beijing-Hankou line to transport materials appeared in people's minds again. We thank the soldiers of the Railway Corps and the railway employees who built this road, and we also deeply thank the farmers along the line.

    从北京到汉口
    陈迹
    用五十三个钟头，乘京汉路的火车，可从北京到汉口。一千二百一十二公里——这是一段遥远的行程。在每一站、段，人们都可看见恢复、重建的痕迹。感承铁路工人、沿线的农民和铁道兵团的士兵们！他们在贯通我国中部的这条大动脉中，投入了自己艰辛的劳动和惊人的毅力。三四年前，人们还不可能想到今年元旦京汉全线能够通车的情景。那时候，中国人民为要战胜敌人，曾经无数次彻底破坏敌伪匪军借以进攻中国人民的这条战略动脉。钢轨枕木被埋藏起来，大部分桥梁支离破碎，不少的路基都被人民垦成耕地了。当着中国人民赶走了敌人，解放京汉全路以后，不到一年的功夫就又使它全部通车。中国人民创造了奇迹。
    我们还记得去年解放京津的战役。铁路工人在“解放军打到那里，铁路修到那里！”的口号下英勇支援前线。在北京到长辛店的线路上，京保筑路处第一工程队在零下严寒中和永定河的冰块作斗争，提前三天修好芦沟桥。京保沿线的人们，至今还清晰的记忆着第一、二工程队抢修京保段的功绩。那时候，材料极度困难，工人们一面钉道，一面搜寻材料。冰冻的永定河里藏有钢轨，工人们凿破冰块，涌入河水，一天半天不上岸，直至钢轨捞完为止。材料找来了，没有煤，不能用机车运送。工人们担负起火车头的任务，前面拉，后面推。尽管困难重重，他们每天每人还钉道十公尺以上，提前半月筑好全段。南北拒马河在北河桥下汇成一支巨流，河宽一百八十三公尺。半年前，工人们屹立在寒气砭骨的水中，修筑全长四百多公尺的北河桥。他们用铁棍砸碎河底的石头，把桥桩一根根楔进河底。无论日本或国民党统治时期，工人们每人每天最多打三根桥桩；现在每人每天能打十根。北河桥共有十九个桥墩，九个曾被炸毁。国民党时代要想修复它，至少得半年时间。然而解放后的工人只用六十六天就修复了，比预定时间提早了二十天。
    从保定到石家庄，共有一百三十五公里的线路，要经过唐河、沙河、滹沱河等十三条河流，要通过一百一十八座大小桥梁。这段路的破坏程度，比京保段彻底得多。人民列车从保定向南开出，遇到的第一个大桥就是新唐河桥。参加修桥的工人对我说，去年修这座桥时，山洪暴涨四次，他们每天在“齐脖子”深的水里坚持工作，有的工人曾在水里坚持二十四小时。有一次，桥工们刚刚把桥北面被河水冲倒的桩架扶起，河水忽然猛涨起来，眼看着桩架又被河水冲跑。工人们急坏了，一个个跳下水去，追赶桩木至四五里地，有的工人被浪花打昏了头，有的被河水噎住嗓子。他们还是不停地打捞桩木，一直到捞完为止。在秋雨连绵的九月里，工人们胜利的架起了一百五十公尺长的新唐河桥。
    保石段的悟空桥（滹沱河大桥）上，现在还显明的写着这样的字迹：“争取十月革命节修通保石段，把火车开到石家庄！”修路的英雄们在九月里由南北两端相对赶修，悟空河南北两岸的火车跟在线路工人的后面，不断发出雄壮的吼声。职工们向记者回忆当时的心情说：“两岸车头直叫，咱们恨不得一晚修完。”他们自动加班。黑夜里有七盘打桩架子闪烁着辉煌的灯光，两架卷扬机发出轰轰马达声；冷水里的工人们迎风吆喝，压住了滹沱河不断的呼啸。树立排架的纪录从每天七个增到二十三个。在保定以北每人平均每日做土方四立方公尺，在抢修悟空桥的工程中，提高到十四立方公尺的空前纪录。他们日日夜夜、废寝忘食地修筑这座桥，火车终于在十月革命节通到了石家庄。
    石家庄南行二百三十公里，即达安阳。这是京汉铁路最后动工的一段。修复这段路的是铁道兵团第×支队全体指战员。路经元氏、高邑、邢台、邯郸等地时，沿途的农民告诉我们关于“飞兵”们的故事。为什么叫做“飞兵”呢？就是说，铁道兵团的指战员修路飞快，一眨眼就修到眼前。担任抢修线路的×××线路大队，曾以每日五公里三百三十公尺的最高速度，大家手擎火炬，在深夜突击前进。午夜一时，邯郸市民尚在睡梦中，他们静悄悄地把铁路修过了邯郸。这个事情，曾传遍了邯郸市，大家争相赞扬。×××线路大队政委贾庆祥对我说，他们的大队是新近成立的，在他们调到这条线路上工作以前，他们还从未修过路。开始没有经验，七八百人一天只修了八百公尺，大家非常泄气。屡次开会讨论，改变抢修方法。一直改变到第七种方法时，人数减至四百人，每天都能修好三公里六百公尺。他们这种新方法叫做“分工负责，有机配合”，把全队分成四部分：（一）抬钢轨和抬枕木的。枕木抬到那里，钢轨就铺到那里；（二）钉道钉的。钢轨铺到那里，道钉就钉到那里；（三）补修的。火车开到那里，补修的就跟在后面，补齐枕木，初步拨道起道和捣固；（四）大补修的，完全按照标准进行补修，保证线路的质量。石安线上每小时行车可达四十公里的速度，“飞兵”们不仅做到了“快”，而且还做到了“好”。
    在我和×支队的英雄们谈起修路架桥的事迹时，他们说：“我们没什么突出的事情，我们人人都有一股干劲，在“谁也不准耽误谁”的口号下，我们埋头苦干。过去我们常常听说桥梁工程巨大，桥梁修成的时间往往落在线路的后面。第×支队克服了这种现象。不管河水怎样冰冷，他们从不间断打桩的工作，也从不厌倦改良打桩的方法。泜水桥桩上画着蒋匪介石的鬼脸，他们五六十人抬着五百多斤的铁锤，向着蒋介石锤去，“哼哟！哼哟！打死蒋介石哟，建设新中国！”的歌声，日夜震荡在冰冻的泜水河上。邢台县派来参加修桥的犯人看见他们这样劳苦的精神，深深感动，他们也跟着积极前进，获得了不少难有的成绩。在一次庆功大会上，邢台犯人得到了铁道兵团给他们的奖旗。×支队英雄们的工作精神，同时又教育了沿途不爱劳动的懒汉。安阳城的顾家庄，有个二流子名叫顾德，好吃懒做，人民政府曾多方设法改造他，他还不改。这一次他被派来修路，起初还是老样子。他看见在冰河里紧张工作的战士，他的思想渐渐改变了。他逢人就说：“那有这样的部队！打了多年的仗，还要在这儿拚命修路筑桥。我们——要学习他们！”伟大的劳动精神，教育了二流子——顾德，顾德从此在民工队伍里做起了带头的模范。石安段修复通车后，在评模大会上，顾德被选为劳动模范。
    火车开到那里，那里的农民都以欢欣的目光注视着。几个月以前，他们还在农忙时间，就自动搜寻材料，还派出民工参加修路工作，他们把抗日期间埋藏起来的铁轨和枕木献交出来，他们曾出动千千万万辆大车运送铁路器材。这条长达千里的京汉路所用的材料，大部分是仰赖于他们的。曾经领导修复京保和保石两段的孟宪章同志对我说，“京汉路胜利通车，论功行赏，老乡要算第一。”保定到石家庄的线路长达一百三十多公里，老乡们曾交出两万七千根钢轨，除掉杂轨及弯轨外，可以铺设一百一十公里的线路。就是说，全段百分之八十的钢轨是由农民们献送的。迅速修复石安段的铁道兵团的战士在对记者说：“我们把铁路修到那里，那里的老乡就给我们送来大批菜蔬和慰问品，铁路附近村庄的妇女还自动组织缝衣队，给我们缝洗衣服。我们修到高邑城时，老乡们并自动邀我们开联欢会，会上送给我们好多面锦旗。元氏一个县的老乡们就给我们搜集了五千多根钢轨，四千多根道钉，当我们把铁路修至元氏县时，全县锣鼓喧天，老乡们纷纷到我们部队里慰问，他们还自动组织起来，严密地保护沿线的铁路。老乡们对我们的帮助，我们永远不会忘记。”当火车抵达汉口时，往日在京汉线上日以继夜地赶着牛车运送材料的农民们的形影，又涌现在人们脑海中。我们感谢修筑这条路的铁道兵团的战士和铁路员工，我们同时深深感谢这沿线的农民。
