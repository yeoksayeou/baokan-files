    Tangshan Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department Circulates Experience of Amateur Schools
    Must Hire Full-Time Teachers, Have Dedicated Personnel Responsible for School Affairs, Raise Certain Funds, and Grasp the Characteristics of Students
    [Further News] The Propaganda Department of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently summarized the following experiences of the city's cadre amateur schools: 1. To fundamentally solve the problem of cultural learning for on-the-job worker and peasant cadres, there must be long-term teaching plans and regularized teaching systems. Only in this way can cadres be given a vision, their enterprising spirit stimulated, and they can move towards their goals step by step. If small-scale literacy classes or study groups are organized, the teacher problem cannot be solved. However, large-scale regular amateur schools are easier to run in concentrated urban areas because urban transportation is convenient, facilitating learning and unified leadership. To achieve regularization: First, full-time teachers must be hired and given due salaries. In addition, there must be part-time teachers. The Tangshan Cadre School has thirty-two full-time teachers and twenty-one part-time teachers. Second, one or two people must be specially assigned to be responsible for school affairs. Third, there must be a certain amount of funding and the preparation of some simple instruments and equipment. It is very necessary to spend a little money to solve the learning problems of worker and peasant cadres, because our worker and peasant cadres were subjected to class oppression in the old society and had no access to education, and later struggled for many years in a cruel struggle environment without the opportunity to study. Now we should try to give them the opportunity to study.
    2. Because students in on-the-job cadre schools are mostly county and district cadres who have had some political training, their learning is done in their spare time, and the schools are large in scale and require unified leadership, these schools have the following characteristics. Various problems should be solved in teaching and administration according to these characteristics: First, the cultural level of the students is not commensurate with their political level. Generally, students have a certain political level and easily look down on cultural teachers in new areas with lower political levels. To resolve this contradiction, on the one hand, students must be persuaded to put down their airs and learn culture, and on the other hand, teachers must be mobilized to prepare lessons well, strengthen their studies, and improve their politics. Second, the students' Chinese language proficiency is not commensurate with their knowledge of natural science. Generally, their Chinese language proficiency is higher, but their knowledge of natural science is very poor. To resolve this contradiction, classes should be opened according to the different levels of students' various subjects, and various mixed classes should be established for interspersed lessons (such as high elementary school for Chinese and junior elementary school for arithmetic, etc.). Third, the students' reading ability is not commensurate with their writing ability. Generally, students can understand what they read, but have difficulty writing because they are unclear about grammar and the meaning of words. To resolve this contradiction, Chinese language teaching should be combined with grammar, and the white characters on students' essays and the new words in textbooks should be repeatedly emphasized during teaching, so as to arouse everyone's interest in Chinese language. Fourth, there is a contradiction between students' centralized classes and decentralized accommodation. The school only has two hours of class time each day, and after class, everyone returns to their offices, so there is no way to understand the students' learning situation, let alone guide their review. To resolve this contradiction, students should be organized into groups by the offices where they live, and active students with higher cultural and political levels should be selected as group leaders, and teachers should be assigned to guide their review. Group leaders and teachers should maintain close contact and bring students' opinions and requirements back to the school for timely resolution. Difficult problems can be passed on to the subject teachers and explained in class. In addition, teachers should also be divided into various research groups according to the nature of the courses to study their lessons, exchange experiences, and improve teaching methods. Fifth, because students are all on-the-job cadres, they have little time to review. To solve this problem, some review time should be appropriately included in the regular lessons, attention should be paid to organizing and calling on students to seize the time to review on weekdays, and a strict examination and attendance system should be adhered to. Test paper scores and usual (listening, exercises, notes, learning diligence, etc.) scores should be converted into a total average score according to a certain ratio and announced regularly. A reward and punishment system should also be formulated separately. Sixth, students have a high degree of mobility and often ask for leave or are absent from class due to official business. To solve this problem, we should vigorously organize and call on students to implement mutual assistance and mutual teaching, and in addition, we can find teachers for tutoring.

    唐山市委宣传部通报业余学校经验
    须聘专任教员，专人负责校务筹措一定经费，掌握学员特点
    【又讯】中共唐山市委宣传部顷总结该市干部业余学校的几点经验如下：一、要根本解决在职工农干部文化学习的问题，必须有长期的教学计划，正规化的教学制度。这样才能给干部指出一个远景，激发干部进取的精神，并能按步就班地往目标迈进。如办小规模的识字班或学习组，则无法解决教员问题。但大规模的正规的业余学校，在城市集中的条件下才容易办到，因城市交通便利，便于学习与统一领导。要达到正规化的目的：第一，须聘请专任教员，给以应得薪金。另外还须有兼任教员。唐山干校专任教员三十二名，兼职教员二十一名。第二，必须专设一、二人负责校务。第三，必须有一定经费并准备一部分简单仪器、设备。为解决工农干部学习问题，花一点钱，十分必要，因为我们的工农干部在旧社会受阶级压迫，无法求学，后又在残酷斗争环境中奋斗多年，无求学机会，现在应设法给他们以学习机会。
    二、在职干部学校因学员多是有过些政治锻炼的县区干部，学习是利用业余时间，而学校又规模较大且须统一领导，所以这类学校有以下特点，应根据这些特点在教学上和行政管理上解决各种问题：第一，学员的文化水平与政治水平不相称。一般学员都有一定政治水平，容易看不起新区政治水平较低的文化教员。解决这一矛盾，一方面要说服学员放下架子学文化，另一方面要动员教员很好准备功课，加强学习，提高政治。第二，学员国文程度与自然科学常识不相适应。一般是国文程度较高，自然科学常识很差。解决这一矛盾，应按学员各种功课高低不同程度，多开班次，并成立各种混合班，穿插上课（如国文上高小，算术上初小等）。第三，学员的阅读能力与写作能力不相称。一般学员是看书能懂，写作困难，因对文法及字义搞不清楚。解决这一矛盾，国文要配合讲文法，学员作文本上的白字及课本上的生字教课时都应再三提示，如此才能引起大家对国文的兴趣。第四，学员集中上课与分散住宿有矛盾，学校每天上课时间只两小时，上课后各回机关，因此对学员学习情况无从了解，更无从指导其复习。解决这一矛盾，应以学员住宿的机关为单位编组，选出文化政治水平较高的积极学员为组长，教员分工指导复习。小组长和教员间要保持密切联系，将学员意见和要求带回校方及时解决。疑难问题可转知科任教员，在课堂上提出讲解。另外，教员也要按课程性质分成各种研究小组，以钻研功课，交流经验，改善教学方法。第五，因学员都是在职干部，复习时间少。解决这一问题，应在正课内适当包括一些复习时间，注意组织与号召学员在平日抓紧时间复习，同时要坚持严格的考试与考勤制度。试卷评分与平时（听课、练习、笔记、学习勤惰等）评分，应按一定比例折算为总平均分数，定期公布。并另制定奖惩制度。第六，学员流动性大，常请假或因公缺课，解决这一问题应大力组织与号召学员实行互助互教，此外可以找教员补习。
