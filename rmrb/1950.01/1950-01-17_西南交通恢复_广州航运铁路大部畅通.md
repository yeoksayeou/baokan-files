    Southwest Transportation Resumes
    Guangzhou Shipping and Railways Mostly Open
    [Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Water and land transportation centered on Chongqing in the Southwest has gradually resumed. Of the 28 Sichuan River shipping routes that were once suspended, all lines have resumed operations except for the Yibin-Leshan and Yibin-Pingshan lines, which cannot operate due to shallow water. Shipping between the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River, which had been suspended for nine months, has been reconnected. Passenger and freight transport has gradually resumed. Last month, 313 ships, totaling more than 79,000 tons, entered and exited Chongqing. Major highways such as the Hanyu Road, Chuanxiang Road, Chuanqian Road, and Chengyu Road are all open to traffic. The Chuandian Road, Chuanshan Road, and Chuankang Road are under repair. The Xiangqian Highway in Guizhou Province has also been fully repaired, while the Qian Gui Road and Dianqian Road are still under urgent repair. Because the Kuomintang bandit gangs burned and destroyed a large number of highway vehicles, all roads face a shortage of vehicles. Local governments are now mobilizing workers in local repair shops to quickly repair vehicles for use. In addition, postal and telecommunications services in the newly liberated areas of the Southwest and other parts of the country are also open.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] Water and land transportation centered on Guangzhou in Guangdong Province has basically recovered. In terms of water transportation, with the exception of coastal routes which have not yet recovered, inland river routes, including the Pearl River and the East, West, and North Rivers, are now open. Most of the ships dragged away by the enemy and those that fled to Hong Kong and Macau before liberation have returned. There are now 678 ships back in service, of which 217 are scheduled liners. According to statistics, 5,000 ships entered and exited Guangzhou in December, transporting 300,000 tons of cargo, exceeding the average number of ships entering and exiting the port in recent years before liberation. On the railway front, major routes from Guangzhou to Hankou, Sanshui, and other places have resumed operation. The number of scheduled trains has basically returned to the pre-liberation level, and the train speed has fully returned to normal. Direct passenger trains between Shanghai and Guangzhou were launched on the 10th, and the railway bureau plans to add a pair of freight trains. Other sections are also planning to increase the number of trains. More than 4,000 kilometers of highways have been restored. Guangdong originally had about 15,000 kilometers of highways, most of which were destroyed during the Anti-Japanese War. Before liberation, only more than 2,500 kilometers were open to traffic in the province, excluding Hainan Island. The Kuomintang bandit army also carried out large-scale destruction when they fled.

    西南交通恢复
    广州航运铁路大部畅通
    【新华社重庆十六日电】以重庆为中心的西南水陆交通，已逐渐恢复。原陷于停顿状态的二十八条川江航线中，除宜宾至乐山、宜宾至屏山两线，因水浅不能行驶外，其余各线都已全部通航。停顿了九个月的长江上游与中下游的航运已接通。客货运输已逐渐恢复，上月份，重庆进出口轮船三百一十三艘，共七万九千余吨。公路主要干线如汉渝路、川湘路、川黔路、成渝路，均已全部通车。正在修复中的有川滇路、川陕路、川康路。贵州省境的湘黔公路亦已全线修通，黔桂路、滇黔路则正继续抢修中。因国民党匪帮曾将大批公路车辆焚烧破坏，各路均有车辆不敷使用的困难，现正由各地人民政府发动各地修车厂工人赶速修理车辆，以供应用。此外，西南新解放地区与国内各地邮电亦均已畅通。
    【新华社广州十六日电】以广州为中心的广东水陆交通已基本上恢复。水路交通除沿海航线未恢复外，内河航线，包括珠江及东、西、北江现均已畅通。解放前被敌人拖走和逃避到香港、澳门的船只，大部已经归来，现已有六百七十八艘复航，其中有二百一十七艘为定期班船。据统计，十二月份进出广州的船只达五千只，运输货物达三十万吨，已超过解放前近年来出入口船只的平均数字。铁路方面，自广州至汉口、三水等主要路线均已恢复通车。班车数量已基本上恢复解放前的水准，车行速率亦已完全恢复正常。上海、广州直达客车已于十日开行，路局并计划加开货车一对。其他各线段也在计划增加班次。公路已经恢复四千余公里。广东原有公路约一万五千公里，抗战期间大部被破坏，至解放前，全省除海南岛外，通车的只有二千五百余公里，国民党匪军溃逃时并曾大肆破坏。
