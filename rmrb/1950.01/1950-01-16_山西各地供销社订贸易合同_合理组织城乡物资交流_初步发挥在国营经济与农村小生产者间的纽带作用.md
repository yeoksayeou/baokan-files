Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 14th: Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Shanxi Province, by signing trade contracts with state-owned trading companies, have initially played a linking role in the material exchange between small rural producers and state-owned trade organizations, providing an important method for further rational organization of urban and rural trade.

Since October of last year, the Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and its branches have successively signed trade contracts with state-owned trading companies. These include the cotton purchase contract signed by the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative with the Taiyuan branch of the Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Company at the end of October, and the contracts signed by the cooperative with the Taiyuan branches of the Grain, Oil, and General Merchandise Companies in mid-November for the purchase of grain and oilseeds, and the sale of industrial products on commission. The supply and marketing cooperatives of the four special districts of Yuci, Changzhi, etc., and more than twenty counties including Zuoquan, Xiyang, Yuci, Heshun, Licheng, Taigu, Shouyang, Pingding, Yangqu, Mengxian, Changzhi, Qin County, Lingchuan, Pingshun, Lucheng, Wutai, and Dingxiang, respectively signed trade contracts with state-owned native produce, mountain goods, and fur companies.

    *Planned Acquisition of Native Products Overcomes Blindness of Small Rural Producers*

Based on the experience of the past two months, the signing of trade contracts between supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned trading companies has the following benefits:

(1) The signing of trade contracts guarantees the completion of the state's material acquisition plan on the one hand, and promotes the sale of products from small rural producers in an organized manner on the other. This not only stimulates the production of native products, but also gradually overcomes the blindness of small production. After the Provincial General Cooperative signed a cotton purchase contract with the Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Company, it organized the supply and marketing cooperatives in the Yicheng and Fenyang special districts to complete the task of purchasing 320,000 jin of cotton in November of last year. After the Pingshun County Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed a contract with the Native Produce and Mountain Goods Company, it signed contracts with 55 village cooperatives in the county, enabling 53 of the county's 69 walnut-producing villages to organize the cracking of walnut kernels and collectively sell more than 58,000 jin. Fifty of the county's 64 codonopsis pilosula-producing villages also organized the collection of codonopsis pilosula for sale through the state-owned trading company. After the Lingchuan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed a contract with the Native Produce Company, it also signed contracts with 65 village cooperatives throughout the county, organizing more than 1,800 people to crack walnut kernels and organizing carpenters in 33 disaster-stricken villages to manufacture wooden boxes for packing walnut kernels. After the Yangquan Industrial and Mining Area Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed a contract with the Native Produce and Mountain Goods Company, it also organized 513 sulfur mines for production, and the products were transported and exported through state-owned trade organizations. In this way, the sales of many native products have been resolved, and even the large quantities of hemp skins and oilseeds from Changzhi, Yicheng and other places, which were difficult to sell in previous years, can be exported steadily.

    *Direct Supply of Industrial Products to Small Producers Reduces Intermediate Exploitation*

(2) Due to the signing of contracts on both sides, the supply and marketing cooperatives pay attention to investigating the needs of small producers, and can obtain industrial products directly from state commercial organizations in a more planned way to supply small producers. On the other hand, state-owned trade organizations can promote industrial products in a planned way, directly connect with small producers through the supply and marketing cooperatives, restrict the activities of speculative merchants, and reduce the exploitation of small producers. The cooperatives in each county of the Changzhi Special District that signed contracts with state-owned trading companies have investigated the consumption situation of their members. After organizing the purchase of agricultural products, the Pingshun County Supply and Marketing Cooperative supplied its members with more than 61,000 jin of edible salt, more than 26,100 chi of native cloth, more than 7,000 chi of foreign cloth, more than 600 jin of kerosene, more than 700 jin of cotton, and more than 8,000 pieces of various agricultural tools in two months. After helping its members sell agricultural products, the Lingchuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative also purchased 41,000 jin of edible salt, more than 1,300 jin of kerosene, more than 5,800 chi of foreign cloth, and more than 17,000 chi of native cloth from state trade organizations according to their consumption plans. From December 1st to 20th of last year, the Taiyuan branch of the Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Company supplied the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative with yarn and cloth worth 701.778 million yuan according to the contract; the Taiyuan branch of the General Merchandise Company supplied the Provincial General Cooperative with industrial products worth 319.393 million yuan.

(3) The assistance of state trade organizations to supply and marketing cooperatives in terms of prices makes it easier for the business of supply and marketing cooperatives to develop. The Lingchuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative greatly won the support of its members by purchasing their walnuts at a price 200 yuan higher than the market price. The village cooperatives in Qin County stimulated the masses to compete to join the cooperatives because they organized the exchange of large quantities of hemp skins for cheap industrial products. The contracts signed by the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative with the Oil and Fat and General Merchandise branches clearly stipulate that when members sell oilseeds, they will be purchased at a price 2% higher than the market price, and when members purchase general merchandise, they will be given priority at a price 2% lower than the listed price. As a result, the influence of cooperatives among the masses has greatly increased.

    *Promote Rural Sideline Occupations and Improve Technology*

(4) The clear specification of the specifications of exchanged goods in the contract promotes the improvement of rural sideline production technology, thus enabling products to obtain a wider sales market. For example, due to the contract regulations, the grass braid industry in Lucheng has changed its previous coarse braids and processed them carefully, which not only greatly increased sales, but also increased prices, directly increasing the income of rural handicraftsmen.

At present, there are still some shortcomings in the execution of contracts between supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned trade organizations, such as the reluctance of some trade organizations to give preferential treatment to cooperatives in terms of prices due to fear of trouble, and the phenomenon that some cooperative cadres have a purely profit-making perspective and treat state-owned trade organizations with a private merchant attitude. These need to be overcome and improved.

    山西各地供销社订贸易合同
    合理组织城乡物资交流
    初步发挥在国营经济与农村小生产者间的纽带作用
    【新华社太原十四日电】山西省各地的供销合作社，由于和国营贸易公司订立了贸易合同，在农村小生产者与国营贸易机关的物资交换上初步发挥了纽带作用，为进一步合理地组织城乡贸易提供了一个重要的方法。
    自去年十月份以来，山西省的供销合作总社和各地分社陆续与国营贸易公司签订了贸易合同，其中有去年十月底省供销总社与花纱布太原分公司签订的购棉合同，十一月中旬该社与太原的粮食、油脂、百货等分公司分别签订的代购粮食、油料及代销工业品的合同，榆次、长治等四个专区供销社及左权、昔阳、榆次、和顺、黎城、太谷、寿阳、平定、阳曲、盂县、长治、沁县、陵川、平顺、潞城、五台、定襄等二十余县的供销社分别与国营的土产、山货、皮毛等公司签订的贸易合同等。
            有计划收购土产克服农村小生产者盲目性
    根据两个月来的经验，供销合作社和国营贸易公司签订合同进行贸易，有下面几个好处：
    （一）贸易合同的签订，一方面保证了国家收购物资计划的完成，一方面有组织的推销了农村小生产者的产品，不但刺激土产品的生产，而且还可以逐渐克服小生产的盲目性。省总社与花纱布公司订立了代购棉花的合同后，即在去年十一月份内组织了翼城、汾阳两专区的供销社完成了购棉三十二万斤的任务。平顺县供销社与土产山货公司订立合同后，便与该县五十五个村社订立合同，使全县六十九个产核桃村中有五十三个村组织起来敲核桃仁，集体推销了五万八千余斤。该县六十四个产党参村中也有五十个村组织起来将党参集中起来经过国营贸易公司推销。陵川县供销社与土产公司订立合同后，亦与全县六十五个村社订立合同，组织了一千八百余人敲核桃仁，并组织灾区三十三个村的木匠制造装核桃仁的木箱。阳泉工矿区供销社与土产山货公司订立合同后，亦组织了五百一十三个硫磺矿进行生产，产品经国营贸易机构运输出口。这样，许多土产的销路都得到了解决，甚至往年难于推销的长治、翼城等地的大宗麻皮与油籽等土产，也能源源出口。
            直接供给小生产者工业品减轻中间剥削
    （二）由于合同的签订二方面，供销社就注意调查小生产者的需要，能较有计划地向国家商业机关直接取得工业品，供给小生产者，另一方面，国营贸易机关能有计划地推销工业品，通过供销社和小生产者直接联系起来，限制了投机商人的活动，使小生产者少受中间剥削。长治专区与国营贸易公司订立合同的各县合作社，均调查了社员的消费情况。平顺县供销社在组织收购农产品后，两月中即供给社员食盐六万一千余斤，土布两万六千一百余尺，洋布七千余尺，煤油六百余斤，棉花七百余斤，各种农具八千余件。陵川供销社帮助社员出售农产品后，亦按其消费计划，向国家贸易机关购入食盐四万一千斤，煤油一千三百余斤，洋布五千八百余尺，土布一万七千余尺。去年十二月一日至二十日，花纱布太原分公司即按合同供给省供销社价值七亿零一百七十七万八千元的纱、布；百货太原分公司供给省总社价值三亿一千九百三十九万三千元的工业品。
    （三）由于国家贸易机关在价格上对供销社的帮助，使供销社业务易于得到发展。陵川供销社因以高于市价二百元的价格收购社员的核桃，大大得到社员的拥护。沁县各村合作社，由于组织以大批麻皮换得便宜工业品，刺激了群众争先入社。省供销总社与油脂，百货分公司签订的合同中，均明确规定社员出售油料时，按高于市价百分之二的价格收购，社员购买百货时，以低于牌价百分之二的价格优先售给。因而合作社在群众中的影响大为提高。
            促进农村副业提高技术
    （四）由于合同中明确规定了交换物品的规格，促进了农村副业生产技术的提高，因而使产品获得更广阔的外销市场。如潞城的草帽辫业，由于合同规定，改变了以往的粗辫，并精细加工，不仅销路大增，价钱也提高，直接增加了农村手工业者的收入。
    目前供销合作社与国营贸易机关间在执行合同上尚存在着一些缺点，如某些贸易机关对合作社不愿在价格上优待，怕麻烦，某些合作社干部有单纯营利观点，以私商态度对待国营贸易机关等现象，这是需要克服和改进的。
