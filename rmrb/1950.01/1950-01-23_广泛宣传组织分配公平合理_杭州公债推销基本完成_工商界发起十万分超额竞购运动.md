Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 22nd – Thanks to widespread publicity and organizational efforts, along with the adoption of correct sales methods, the people of Hangzhou have basically completed the glorious task of selling 1.5 million shares of Victory Public Bonds and are striving to exceed the target. As of the 20th, workers city-wide had subscribed to over 150,000 shares, faculty and students of Zhejiang University subscribed to over 9,000 shares, and the Elementary School Teachers' Association subscribed to over 10,000 shares. In addition to the allocated 1.2 million shares already purchased by the business and industrial sectors, they have launched a campaign to oversubscribe by 100,000 shares. As of the 19th, eighteen industries have joined this movement, with oversubscriptions reaching 30,292 shares. Prosperous wealthy households are also confident in completing the task of 200,000 shares.

Hangzhou conducted extensive and in-depth publicity work during this public bond sale, enhancing the political awareness of people from all walks of life. In addition to utilizing newspapers and radio stations, various methods such as art, music, and slideshows were frequently used for promotion. Students from major universities and colleges city-wide launched street publicity campaigns and conducted family visits. Furthermore, all municipal agencies, factories, and schools organized study sessions on public bond issuance. Influenced by the high level of patriotic enthusiasm shown by workers and students taking the lead in subscriptions, a city-wide surge in public bond purchases was created. Simultaneously with the publicity efforts, a sales organization was established city-wide from top to bottom. In addition to the Sales Headquarters, five branches were set up for workers, the business and industrial sectors, youth and students, women, and retired civil and military officials, along with one hundred and thirty-seven sub-branches. The Municipal Sales Headquarters was based on the presidium of the Second All-Circles People's Representative Conference, extensively absorbing people from all walks of life and members of various democratic parties. Heads of the branches were also members of the headquarters, and heads of the sub-branches were members of the branches. This ensured that the headquarters' work plans were smoothly and rapidly communicated and implemented, and that the work of the branches and sub-branches could be promptly guided. The fundamental key to Hangzhou's completion of the public bond sales task this time was fair and reasonable allocation. Hangzhou prioritized industry over commerce, differentiated between large and small entities, and based the allocation on operational conditions and the amount of capital. Using business tax as a reference, a method of self-reporting, public discussion, and democratic evaluation was adopted for subscriptions, followed by focused additional allocation (i.e., in addition to the figures allocated by industry, increased quotas were assigned to certain larger industrial and commercial entities), to ensure that the figure allocation was fair and reasonable. This sales method was unanimously supported by the business and industrial sectors. To ensure that the allocated figures were fair and reasonable, the sales committee also conducted investigations and research. The business and industrial branch, due to its in-depth investigation and research into the number of industries, operational conditions, and affordability throughout the city, was able to grasp the principles of fairness and reasonableness when allocating figures and conducting democratic evaluations. Initially, the business and industrial sectors had many concerns when purchasing bonds, such as fear of exposing their wealth and implicating others, leading many to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. Later, larger industries and well-respected industrialists and businessmen took the lead in subscribing under the promotion of the sales committee, which then drove other members of the business and industrial sectors to follow suit. At the same time, the sales committee addressed various concerns by conducting widespread education and explanation, making the business and industrial sectors understand the benefits of buying public bonds, which were "beneficial to the country and to themselves."

In individual factories and schools in Hangzhou, due to some branch leaders not properly grasping the sales policy, some deviations of "competition" and "challenges" that did not take actual situations into account occurred. This led some workers and students, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, to subscribe to amounts exceeding their ability, affecting their livelihoods. There were also attempts at equal distribution among some wealthy households. These shortcomings have been promptly corrected.

    广泛宣传组织分配公平合理
    杭州公债推销基本完成
    工商界发起十万分超额竞购运动
    【新华社杭州二十二日电】由于进行了广泛的宣传和组织工作，并采取了正确的推销方法，杭州市人民已基本上完成推销胜利公债一百五十万分的光荣任务，并正争取超过任务。截至二十日止，全市职工认购数字已达十五万分以上，浙江大学师生认购九千余分，小学教师联合会认购一万余分，工商界除已认购一百二十万分的配销额外，并发起了十万分的超额竞购运动，截至十九日止，已有十八个行业参加这一运动，超额竞购数目已达三万零二百九十二分。殷实富户亦有信心完成二十万分的任务。
    杭州市在这次推销公债中曾广泛深入地进行宣传工作，提高各界人民的政治认识，除利用报纸、广播台外，并利用美术、音乐、幻灯等各种方法经常宣传，全市各大中专科学校的学生，展开了街头宣传和家庭访问，全市机关工厂学校又组织了发行公债的学习。在全市职工学生带头认购的高度爱国热情的影响下，造成了全市各界购买公债的热潮。与展开宣传工作同时，全市又自上而下地建立了推销机构，除推销总会外，下设职工、工商界、青年学生、妇女、殷实富户与退伍文武官吏五个分会，一百三十七个支会。市推销总会是以第二次各界人民代表会议主席团为基础，广泛吸收各界人士、各民主党派参加，各分会负责人均为总会委员，支会负责人又为分会委员，这样总会的工作计划既能顺利迅速地传达贯彻下去，又能及时指导分支会的工作。杭市这次完成公债推销工作的基本关键是分配公平合理。杭市是以工轻于商，分别大小，根据营业情况好坏、资金多寡作标准，以营业税作参考，采用自报公议、民主评定的方法认购，然后再重点加配（即除按行业分配数字外，以某些较大的工商业家为对象增加配额），使数字分配作到公平合理。这种推销方法获得了工商界的一致拥护。为使分配数字公平合理，推销委员会还进行调查研究。工商界分会由于对全市行业数目、营业情况、负担能力作了深入的调查研究，因而在分配数字和民主评议时，就能掌握了公平合理的原则。工商界开始认购时顾虑较多，如怕暴露自己有钱、连累别人等，以致多持观望态度。后来，较大的行业和有名望的工商业家在推销委员会推动下首先认购，这样就推动了其他工商界跟着认购。同时，推销委员会针对各种顾虑，普遍进行教育和解释，使工商界了解购买公债“功在国家、利在自己”的好处。
    杭州市推销公债工作，在个别工厂、学校中，由于某些分会领导上没有很好地掌握推销方针，发生了一些不照顾实际情况的“竞赛”与“挑战”的偏向，致各别工人和学生在爱国热情的激励下，认购数超过了他们的能力而影响生活。某些殷实富户中也曾有企图平均摊派的现象。这些缺点均已及时纠正。
