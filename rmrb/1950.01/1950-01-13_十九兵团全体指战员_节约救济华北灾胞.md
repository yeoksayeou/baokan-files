Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 12th: The entire command and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's 19th Army Corps, deeply concerned about the compatriots in the disaster areas of North China, launched a campaign to conserve and provide disaster relief in mid-November last year, and wrote letters to express their sympathy to the compatriots in the disaster areas. In a month and a half, the entire army has saved more than 111,700 jin of millet, donated more than 100.85 million yuan in Renminbi, 15,300 jin of firewood coupons, and a large number of clothes, shoes, and socks. The first batch of 27 million yuan in cash has been remitted, and the remaining items and funds will be transported and remitted to North China successively. The 19th Army Corps was originally a North China troops. After liberating North China last year, it came to the Northwest battlefield to cooperate with the Northwest brother troops to complete the glorious task of liberating Northwest China. When news of disasters in various parts of North China came, the officers and soldiers of the entire army spontaneously tightened their belts and enthusiastically donated aid. At the same time, they wrote a large number of letters of condolence, expressing their utmost respect for the achievements of the elders and folks in North China in supporting the front lines and persisting in the struggle during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, and expressing their deep concern about the serious disaster situation. The officers and soldiers of the 578th Regiment said in their letter of condolence: "We are the people's soldiers, who grew up and became stronger in North China. We are connected to the people of North China by blood. Your disaster is our disaster, and we must help you overcome the disaster." Many letters encouraged the elders and folks in their hometowns to engage in production for self-salvation and reduce the burden on the People's Government. Soldiers Yuan Huinian, Wang Fengshan, Liu Zhenying, Tian Jiuxing (female), and Lang Jie of a certain division of the 65th Army jointly wrote a letter saying: "We have spontaneously launched a conservation campaign, saving one liang of rice per person per day to help North China solve some of its difficulties. The amount is small, but it is enough to prove our deep concern for the elders and folks in North China." The letter called on the elders and folks in the disaster areas to "develop sideline production under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government, overcome the disaster with a fighting spirit, overcome difficulties, and do not be pessimistic and disappointed and simply rely on government relief." In a letter written by Zheng Baoqin, she said: "I hope you will grit your teeth and get through this difficulty. You must overcome the difficulty and not bow to it! After overcoming this difficulty, the days ahead will be better and better!"

    节约救济华北灾胞
    【新华社兰州十二日电】人民解放军第十九兵团全体指战员，殷切关怀华北灾区同胞，于去年十一月中旬发起节约救灾运动，并纷纷写信慰问灾区同胞。一个半月来，全军已节约小米十一万一千七百余斤，捐集人民币一亿零八百五十余万元，柴票一万五千三百斤及衣服鞋袜等甚多。首批现款二千七百余万元已汇出，其余物品、款项将陆续运送汇寄华北。十九兵团原为华北子弟兵团，去年解放华北后，开来西北战场，协同西北兄弟部队完成解放大西北的光荣任务。华北各地受灾消息传来，全军指战员自动节衣缩食踊跃捐助。同时写了大批慰问信，对华北父老在抗日战争、解放战争中支援前线，坚持斗争的功绩表示极为崇敬，对严重灾情表示深为挂怀。五七八团指战员在慰问信中说：“我们是人民子弟兵，是在华北成长壮大起来的，我们与华北人民血肉相连，你们的灾难，就是我们的灾难，我们要帮助你们战胜灾荒。”许多信中慰勉家乡父老生产自救，减轻人民政府的负担。六十五军某师战士苑惠年、王凤山、刘振英、田九星（女）、郎捷等五人联名写信说：“我们自动发起节约运动，每人每日节米一两，以助华北解决部分困难，数目微小，但也足能证明我们对华北父老殷切关怀的心情。”信中吁请灾区父老们“在人民政府的领导和帮助下，开展副业生产，以战斗的精神战胜灾荒，克服困难，不要悲观失望与单纯依赖政府救济。”郑宝琴写的一封信中说：“希望你们咬紧牙关渡过这困难，要克服困难，不能向困难低头呀！渡过了这次困难，以后的日子，就会一天比一天更好起来！”
