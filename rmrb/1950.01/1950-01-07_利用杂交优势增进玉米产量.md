    Using Hybrid Vigor to Increase Corn Yield
    Wu Shao Kui
            I. Introduction
    "Hybrid vigor" is a term in genetics. Simply put, it means that the offspring produced by crossing two different parent lines grow vigorously and are far superior to the original parent lines. We can use this hybrid advantage to improve quality and increase yield. The use of hybrid vigor to improve human welfare predates the advent of modern science. For example, the mules we use for farming and carrying loads are hybrids of horses and donkeys; the "pianniu" used by people in the border areas of Kang and Tibet are hybrids of yellow cattle and yak. They are physically strong and able to carry heavy loads over long distances, far superior to the original parent breeds. Because this has been the custom for a long time, we no longer find it strange.
    As for the use of hybrid vigor under scientific research, there are two notable examples in animals and plants. In animals, the silkworm benefits from hybrid strains, increasing the health of the worms and improving the quality and yield of silk. Today, almost all silkworm farmers in the Jiangnan region use hybrid silkworm eggs. According to Japanese research, China was the first country to observe the genetic phenomena that occur in the offspring of silkworm hybrids, which was already recorded in the book "Tiangong Kaiwu." In plants, the most successful application is in corn. More than 95 percent of the corn produced in the United States is grown from hybrid seeds. Its yield can be increased by more than 30 percent compared to ordinary corn varieties. Other traits such as disease resistance, drought resistance, insect resistance, and lodging resistance have also been greatly improved.
    Today, hybrid varieties are not only used in silkworms and corn, but also in pigs and chickens. In addition, the use of hybrid vigor is being studied in vegetables, potatoes, trees, and other areas. This shows that if we can grasp the laws governing the occurrence of this genetic phenomenon, we can achieve great results in improving and increasing the production of animals and plants in agriculture.
    There are two approaches to utilizing hybrid vigor in corn: one is to start with inbreeding, and the other is to use variety hybridization. The former is a thorough and fundamental method, but it takes eight to ten years to obtain excellent hybrid varieties. The latter is a temporary remedy during the transition period, with simpler procedures and a shorter time requirement. Now I will focus on the second method. As mentioned above, this method is a temporary remedy during the transition period. It does not mean that we should abandon corn inbreeding breeding work with this method, but rather that we should strengthen inbreeding work with this method, because hybrids from inbred lines can obtain stronger hybrid vigor and are easier to control.
            II. Methods and Results of Variety Hybridization in Nanjing
    In the spring of 1947, I was in charge of corn improvement work at Jinling University in Nanjing. In addition to inbreeding breeding work, we also tried variety hybridization. The resulting hybrid varieties were used for yield comparison experiments at the Jinling University farm outside Taipingmen in Nanjing last year. The results showed that the yield increased by 22 to 24 percent compared to the original local yellow corn. Now I will introduce the methods used at that time:
    1.  Varieties used as parents: The corn parents in this experiment were a yellow corn variety (Flint corn) grown by farmers outside Taipingmen in Nanjing, and a yellow dent corn variety (originally from the United States) introduced from the Northwest Extension and Reproduction Station in Wugong.
    2.  Planting and treatment methods: The dent corn yellow corn was used as the female parent, and the Nanjing yellow corn (Flint corn) was used as the male parent, planted in rows in the hybrid area. The female parent variety was planted in two rows each time, and the male parent variety was planted in one row (in the first year, because I did not know the maturity period of the two varieties, the male parent was also planted in two rows each time, but planted on two different dates, in order to adjust the flowering of the male flowers and the silking of the female ears in the future. Fortunately, the maturity periods of the two varieties were the same, and there were no difficulties in pollination).
    When the tassels of the female parent plants had partially emerged but had not yet flowered, we had to go to the field once a day to remove all the tassels of the female parent plants, so that their female ears would not have the opportunity to be pollinated by pollen of the same variety. This was the most important and most laborious work. Neglecting this work would make the experiment a complete failure.
    After the plants matured, only the ears on the female parent plants were harvested and kept as seeds for the following year. The seeds on the ears of the male parent can only be used for food or feed, and cannot be kept as seeds for the following year.
    3.  Increase in yield of variety hybrids: Last spring, the seeds of the hybrid variety were separated according to the dent type and Flint type, and a yield comparison experiment was conducted with the female parent yellow corn. The results are now shown in the table below:

        Variety                                     Yield                              Yield Increase
                                                   (Jin per mu whole ear yield)     (Percentage with the parent being 100)
        Nanjing Yellow Corn (Male Parent)              280.2                                   100.0
        Variety? Hybrid (Dent type seed)              347.5                                   124.0
        Variety? Hybrid (Flint type seed)             343.1                                   122.4
            III. Corn Variety Hybridization Methods and Results Used in the Soviet Union:
    In the report by Academician M.A. Olshansky at the annual meeting of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Moscow in late July last year, he mentioned the corn variety hybridization methods they used. Now I will translate it below (translated from the English version of the conference proceedings published in the Soviet Union).
    1.  Conditions for selecting parent varieties: The highest-yielding local corn variety should be used as the female parent, and other superior varieties should be used as the male parent.
    2.  Planting conditions: The female and male parent varieties in the hybrid area should be planted alternately, with only one row of each variety each time. This allows the female parent plants to have the opportunity to continuously receive pollen from the male parent when the female ears are silking. The hybrid seeds obtained in this way can have higher yields and greater resistance to smut when planted the following year.
    3.  Increase in yield and resistance to smut of variety hybrids (see the table below for details).
    (1) Comparison of Yield and Smut Resistance between Varieties and Inter-Variety Hybrids

        Year  Ordinary Variety Brown County (High Yielding Variety)
             Yield Smut (Hundred kilograms per hectare) (Percentage)
             Variety Hybrid Brown County and Minnesota 23
             Yield Smut (Hundred kilograms per hectare) (Percentage)
             Ordinary Variety Grunshe vakaya
             Yield (Hundred kilograms per hectare)
             Variety Hybrid Brown County and Grunshe vakaya
             Yield (Hundred kilograms per hectare)
        1939  16.2    9.4      19.5    3.4    11       11
        1940  28.5    8.2      32.7    4.4    11       11
        1947  34.0    ——       39.9    ——    36.6    40.4
    (2) Comparison of Yield Differences Due to the Use of the Same Variety as a Male or Female Parent

        Parents in Variety Hybrids  Yield (Hundred kilograms per hectare)   Difference (Hundred kilograms per hectare)
        Brown County (Female Parent)     36.5
        and Minnesota (Male Parent)      
                                        
        Minnesota 23 (Female Parent)     29.3                                7.2
        and Brown County (Male Parent)

    (3) Relationship between the Number of Parent Rows in the Hybrid Area and the Yield and Disease Resistance of Variety Hybrids
        Year New Method (One Row of Male Parent Interplanted with One Row of Female Parent)
             Yield Smut (Hundred kilograms per hectare) (Percentage)
             Old Method (One Row of Male Parent Interplanted with Two Rows of Female Parent)
             Yield Smut (Hundred kilograms per hectare) (Percentage)
        1947  41.6    3.2               36.1    4.8

    From the above three tables, we can see the following three things:
    (1) Variety hybridization can increase yield and strengthen disease resistance.
    (2) The yield of variety hybrids varies depending on the female parent variety.
    (3) There is a difference in yield and smut resistance between the variety hybrid seeds obtained from planting one row of each parent in the hybrid area and interplanting one row of male parent with two rows of female parent, the former being far superior to the latter.
            IV. Suggestions for the Current Use of Corn Variety Hybridization:
    In order to obtain large and strong hybrid vigor, we must pay attention to the varieties of the two parents. Generally speaking, the greater the genetic distance between the parents, the greater the chance of obtaining hybrid vigor. Therefore, we should use the original corn varieties (Flint corn) from various places in China and hybridize them with American dent corn to obtain more reliable hybrid vigor. There are several points worth mentioning in this regard.
    1.  Selection and retention of male parent variety seeds: Corn is a natural cross-pollinating crop, and seeds are easily mixed. In Nanjing, we used local varieties as the male parent for hybridization, because the male parent is a local variety that is widely cultivated, and there is relatively less chance of mixing. If we use the Soviet method of using foreign varieties as the male parent, in addition to referring to the method of retaining female parent seeds in the following article, we can also continue to use the male parent seeds in the hybrid area for planting in the following year.
    2.  Preservation of female parent variety seeds. If a foreign variety (such as dent corn) is used as the female parent, there are two ways to retain seeds as materials for the next year's parent: (1) purchase seeds from the origin every year, (2) plant an isolated area to isolate this variety from other varieties to avoid the chance of hybridization. The method of isolated planting can be divided into two types: one is to use natural shelter to plant an isolated area, and the other is to use artificial pollination to mix the pollen of several plants and pollinate several female ears in the same variety.
    3.  Hybrid area planting method: If we follow the planting method in Nanjing, that is, using local varieties as the male parent and foreign varieties as the female parent, as long as we know that the pollen maturity and silking period of the two parent varieties are close, we can use them for intercropping. Because the surrounding area is full of local varieties, there is no problem with the pollen supply from the male parent. The surrounding area of the hybrid area only needs to be planted with two or three rows of the male parent variety to protect it from being trampled by humans and animals. If the latter method is adopted, using local high-yielding varieties as the female parent and foreign varieties as the male parent, if there is no natural shelter around the hybrid area, such as forests, hills, villages, etc., it is easily affected by other foreign pollen, unintentionally becoming self-pollination in a broad sense, which will have a bad impact on the increase of hybrid vigor in the future, so several rows of the male parent must be planted as protection rows around the hybrid area. As for how many rows of the male parent should be planted? We may refer to the standards promulgated by Iowa, USA, for the area of the hybrid area and the distance from other varieties, stipulating how many rows of the male parent should be planted as protection rows (see the table below for details).

        Relationship between the Area of the Hybrid Area, the Distance from Neighboring Corn Fields, and the Number of Male Parent Protection Rows to be Planted

        160          140      120         100           80          12

    Note: Each acre is approximately equal to 6 mu, and each foot is approximately equal to 1.0936 shi chi.
    4.  Possibilities for the use of variety hybrids, and several issues that should be paid attention to: There is no doubt that variety hybrids can be used as a yield-increasing material during the transition period, but the following issues should be noted:
    (1) Each region must be able to find a dent corn variety, and its silking or flowering period is not very different from that of the local Flint corn, otherwise, find ways to cross them.
    (2) Only hybridization can be tested in 1950, and small-scale yield comparison experiments should be carried out in various places in 1951 to determine that the yield is high and the quality is good, and then it can be widely promoted after 1952.
    (3) To produce a large number of variety hybrids, the experimental field must promote and supervise the progress, set up a distance area with farmers, and have a method of field inspection during the seed growth period, so as to avoid improper isolation or the failure to completely remove the tassels of the female parent.
    (4) Variety hybrid seeds must be registered and certified by the experimental field and assisted in marketing. The price should be four to six times higher than the market price, so we must pay attention to farmers or merchants who mix ordinary seeds to seek profit, which will lose the credibility of hybrid seeds and cause great losses to farmers.
    (5) It is necessary to educate farmers who grow hybrid varieties to know that the corn grown from these seeds can only be used for consumption and cannot be kept as seeds for the following year, otherwise, the yield will be reduced and the loss will outweigh the gain.
            V. Conclusion
    There is no doubt that corn variety hybridization can increase yield. Both the methods used by Jinling University in Nanjing and the methods announced by the Soviet Union are worth experimenting with and promoting.
    The procedures for breeding seeds and selling seeds are more troublesome than other crops. Fortunately, the village-level cadres now are hard-working farmers, and their production enthusiasm must be improved after the land reform. Of course, the work of producing corn variety hybrid seeds and promoting hybrid seeds will inevitably encounter difficulties in the initial stage. However, if we recognize the importance of increasing production and see the importance of corn hybrids for increasing yield and improving other agronomic traits in the future, and are determined to do it, we will definitely overcome the difficulties and complete this task that is beneficial to farmers' income and the national economy.

    利用杂交优势增进玉米产量
    吴绍骙
            一、引言
    “杂交优势”是遗传学上一个名词。简单的说，就是用两个不同的父母本杂交后，所生出的下一代，生长旺盛，远比原来的父母本优越的意思，我们利用这种杂种的优越性来改良品质，可以增高产量。按利用杂交优势以增进人类的福利，远在科学还未昌明以前，早已在应用了。譬如我们用来耕作和驼载的骡子是由马和驴杂交而来的；康藏边民所用的犏牛，就是用黄牛和毛牛杂交而得的。他们的体力强壮，能够任重致远，远较原来的亲本为强，只因习用惯了，也就对之不感觉什么稀奇。
    至于在科学研究下而利用的杂交优势，在动植物方面，各有一个显著的例子：在动物方面的家蚕，因为应用杂交种，增加了蚕儿的健康，改进了丝的品质和产量，现在江南一带饲养家蚕的农家，几乎完全采用杂交蚕种。据日本人的研究，世界上注意到观察家蚕杂交之后，在它的后代中发生的遗传现象，要以我国为最古，在天工开物这部书上就已经有了记载；在植物方面，则以玉米做的最有成绩，现在美国生产的玉米有百分之九十五以上是从杂交种子产生的。它的产量可以比较普通玉米品种增加百分之三十以上。此外其他的性状如抗病、抗旱、抗虫、耐倒伏等也都有很大的改进。
    现在不仅在家蚕和玉米方面有杂交种的利用，同时猪和鸡也有了杂交种；此外在蔬菜、薯类、树木等方面也都在研究杂交优势的利用。足见我们如果能够掌握住这种遗传现象发生的法则，对于农业上动植物品种的改良和增产，一定可收绝大的效果。
    讲到玉米杂交优势利用方面，计有两个途径：一种是从自交入手，另一种是从事利用品种杂交，前一种是彻底而且基本的办法，但是需要八年到十年的时间才能希望获得优良的杂交种，后一种是过渡期间的补救办法，手续比较简单，需要的时间也较短。现在专谈第二种办法。上边已经说过这个办法是过渡期间的补救办法，所以并不是说有了这个办法就要废弃玉米自交育种工作，而是利用这个办法更应加强自交工作；因为从自交系杂交比较从品种杂交，可以得着更强大的杂交优势，更容易受我们的控制。
            二、在南京举行品种杂交所用的方法和结果
    一九四七年的春天，南京金陵大学，由我担任玉米改良工作，我们除作自交育种工作外，并试用品种杂交，所得的杂交种，去年在南京太平门外金大农场作产量比较试验，结果较原来的本地黄玉米增产百分之二十二到二十四。现在我把当时所用的方法介绍于下：
    １、用作亲本的品种：这个试验的玉米亲本，一个是南京太平门外农家所种植的黄玉米（礈石种），另一个是从武功西北推广繁殖站输入的黄色马齿种（美国原产）。
    ２、种植和处理的方法：以马齿种黄玉米作为母本，南京黄玉米（礈石种）当作父本分行种在杂交区里，母本品种每次专种两行，父本品种种一行（第一年因为不知道两品种的成熟期，所以父本每次也连种两行，但是用两个不同的日期播种，目的在调节将来雄花的开花和雌穗的抽丝期。这次很幸运，两个品种的成熟期相同，并未发生受粉上的困难）。
    当母本植株的雄花穗轴露出了一部份还没有开花之前，每天要到地里去一趟，把所有母本植株露出来的雄花穗轴拔去，好让他们的雌穗没有和同品种花粉受粉的机会，这是最重要而且最费事的工作，忽略了这项工作会使试验前功尽弃的。
    植株成熟之后，只采收母本植株上的穗子，保留起来，作为明年的种子；父本上穗子所结的种子，只能留作食用或作饲料，不能留做下年的种子。
    ３、品种杂交种增加产量的情形：去年春天将杂交种的种子按马齿型和礈石型分别开来，和母本黄玉米做产量比较试验，现在把它的结果列表说明如下： 种            类      产    量                  增    产
                       （每市亩市斤的全穗产量）（百分数交本为一百）南京黄玉米    （父本）    二八○·二            一○○·○品种？杂交种（马齿型的种粒） 三四七·五         一二四·○品种？杂交种（礈石型的种粒）  三四三·一        一二二·四
            三、苏联所用的玉米品种杂交方法和结果：
    去年七月底在莫斯科全苏列宁农业科学研究院举行的年会席上Ｍ．Ａ．Ｏlshansky院士的报告中，提到了他们所用的玉米品种杂交方法，现在摘译于下（这是从苏联刊行的英文版会刊译出的）。
    １、父母本品种选择的条件：应当用本地产量最高的一个玉米品种作为母本，至于父本则用其他较为佳良的品种充之。
    ２、种植方面的条件：杂交区里的母本和父本品种相间种植，每品种每次都只种一行，这样可以使得母本品种植株于雌穗抽丝的时候，有经常不断接受父本方面花粉的机会，这样得到的杂种种子，明年种下之后，产量可以较高，抵抗黑粉病的力量也可以加大。
    ３、品种杂交种增加产量和抵抗黑粉病的情形（详见下表）。
    （一）品种和品种间杂交种的产量和抗黑粉病能力比较年份 普通品种BrownCounty（丰产种） 产量 黑粉病 （每公顷百公斤）
                                               （百分数）品种杂交种BrownCounty和Minnesota23 产量 黑粉病 （每公顷百公斤）
                                               （百分数）
      普通品种Grunshe vakaya  产量  （每公顷百公斤）
      品种杂交和Brown County和Grun shevak aya  产量  （每公顷百
                                                      公斤）一九三九  一六·二  九·四  一九·五  三·四  一一  一一一九四○  二八·五  八·二  三二·七  四·四  一一  一一一九四七  三四·○  ——    三九·九  ——  三六·六  四○·四
    （二）相同品种因用作父本或母本在产量上发生的差异比较
    品种杂交中的父母本    产量（每公顷百公斤）  差异（每公顷百公斤）
    Brown County（母本?         三六·五 
    和Minnesota（父本）
                                                      七·二
    Minnesota23（母本）          二九·三
    和Brown County（父本）
    （三）杂交区父母本种植行数对于品种杂交种产量和抗病能力的关系年份  新法（一行父本与一行母本间种）      旧法（一行父本与二行母
      产量黑粉病                          本间种）
      （每公顷百公斤）（百分数）          产量黑粉病
                                       （每公顷百公斤）（百分数）一九四七  四一·六    三·二              三六·一    四·八  
    从上面的三个表上可以看到下列的三件事就是：
    （１）品种杂交是可以增加产量和加强抵抗病害能力的。
    （２）品种杂交种的产量随着母本的品种而有差异。
    （３）杂交区里父母本各种一行的，和一行父本两行母本间种的，所得的品种杂交种子，在产量和抵抗黑粉病能力方面发生差别，前者远比后者优良。
            四、对于目前利用玉米品种杂交的建议：
    要想获得大而且强的杂交优势，必然要注意到两个父母亲本的品种，凡是亲本的血统较远的，一般说来，能获得杂种优势的机会就越大。所以在国内应当用各地原有的玉米品种（硬粒种即礈石种）和美国的马齿种杂交，来获得较有把握的杂交优势，在这方面有几点值得提出来谈谈。
    １、父本品种种子选留问题：玉米是天然杂交作物，种子很容易变杂，我们在南京用的方法是以本地种作杂交的父本，因为父本是本地普遍栽培的，比较上混杂的机会较少。若用苏联的办法以外来种做父本，则父本种子保留的方法，除参照下条母本种子保留的方法外，也可以用杂交区内父本的种子继续供下年的种植。
    ２、母本品种种子的保存。如果用外来的种（如马齿种）做母本，保留种子作为下年亲本的材料，有两个办法可用：（１）向原产地年年购买种子，（２）种植隔离区，使这品种和其他品种隔离繁殖，避免杂交的机会。隔离植的办法，又可分为两种：一类是利用天然的掩蔽，种植一隔离区，另一种是用人工授粉方法，混合若干株的花粉和同品内若干雌穗受粉。
    ３、杂交区种植法：如果依照在南京的种法，就是用本地种做父本，外来种做母本，只要知道这父母两品种的花粉成熟和雌穗抽丝期接近，就可用来间行种植，因为四周都是本地品种，父本的花粉供给没有问题，杂交区的四周只要种二三行的父本品种保护着免受人畜的践踏即可。倘若采用后者的方法，用本地丰产品种做母本，以外来的品种做父本，杂交区的四周如果没有自然的掩蔽，如同树林、山丘、村落等，那就很容易受着外来其他花粉的影响，无意中成了广义的自花受粉，这对于将来杂交优势的增加会发生不好的影响，所以必须在杂交区的四周多种几行父本作为保护行。至于应当种多少父本行呢？我们不妨参考美国爱沃华州所颁布的杂交区面积和距离其他品种的远近，规定应当种植多少父本行数的标准（详见下表）。

    ４、品种杂交种利用的可能，和应当注意的几件事项：品种杂交种在目前可以作为过渡期间的增产材料是无须怀疑的，不过有下列的几种问题，应当注意：
    （１）各地要能够找着一种马齿种品种，而且它的抽丝或是雄花开放期和本地礈石种相差不甚远，否则设法彼此交配。
    （２）一九五○年只能试行杂交，一九五一年在各地举行小规模的产量比较试验，确定产丰质优，一九五二年以后才可大量推广。
    （３）产生大量品种杂交种，必须由试验场推动监督前进，与农民设隔距区，繁殖种子生长期内，要有到田内实地检查的办法，免得隔离不妥当，或母本的雄穗轴没有拔除尽净。
    （４）品种杂交种子要由试验场登记作证，协助推销，价格应当比市价提高四倍到六倍，所以要注意农家或是商人拿普通种子混充，企图谋利丧失杂交种的信用，使农民遭受了莫大的损失。
    （５）要教育种植杂交种的农家，知道从这类种子长出的玉米只能供作消费，不能再留做下年的种子，否则会减轻产量得不偿失的。
            五、结论
    玉米品种杂交能够增加产量绝无疑问，无论南京金大所用的方法，或是苏联所宣布的方法，都值得试验，加以推广。
    在繁殖种子贩卖种子方面，手续比较其他的作物麻烦些，好在现在村级干部是实干苦干的农民，经过土改之后生产情绪是定要提高的；固然产生玉米品种杂交种子和推广杂交种子的工作，在开始进行中必会遭遇困难。不过假如我们认识增产的重要，看到玉米杂交种对于将来增加产量，及改进其他农艺性状的重要性下，决心做去，一定可以克服困难，完成这一有利于农民收益和国家经济的任务的。
