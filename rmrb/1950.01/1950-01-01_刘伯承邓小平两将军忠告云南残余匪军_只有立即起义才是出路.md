Generals Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping Advise Remnant Bandit Troops in Yunnan
Only Immediate Uprising Is the Way Out
(Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 31st) Generals Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Southwest Front Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, and Deng Xiaoping, Political Commissar, issued a letter of advice to the officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang's 8th and 26th Armies trapped in Yunnan. The letter stated:

    General Li Mi, General Yu Chengwan, and all officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang's 8th and 26th Armies:

    The Kuomintang army on the Chinese mainland, apart from your two armies, has completely ceased to exist. Since our People's Liberation Army advanced into the Southwest, in less than two months, it swept away the last two forces of the Kuomintang on the mainland – the Bai Chongxi bandit troops and the Hu Zongnan bandit troops. With the uprising and response of Generals Lu Han, Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, and Pan Wenhua, the southwestern provinces have been rapidly liberated. All uprising officers and soldiers have been welcomed by the People's Liberation Army, have found a bright future, and are enjoying the New Year in peace and stability. In this vast land, only your two lonely armies have not yet found a home. The whole of China is being liberated, and Chiang Kai-shek is only left with a few isolated islands, which will soon be liberated. Why are you still wandering around in Yunnan? Do you want to escape to Vietnam? The People's Liberation Army has long been prepared to intercept you; do not vainly hope to escape. Even if some remnants and defeated generals escape to Vietnam and become exiles abroad, what way out is there? Being disarmed and imprisoned by the French is certainly disgraceful, and being incorporated by the French into Bao Dai's troops as puppet soldiers is no less disgraceful, is it? Moreover, the People's Liberation Army is bound to pursue you to the ends of the earth; even if you escape to Taiwan again, you will not be able to escape this day. Therefore, there is only one bright road ahead of you: to immediately revolt, break away from the Kuomintang reactionary remnants, and stand on the side of the people. The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army have always implemented a lenient policy. Whoever sincerely repents and makes a fresh start, and has concrete actions that are beneficial to the cause of the people's liberation, will be welcomed. The time you have to consider is now very short. I hope you will quickly awaken, quickly send representatives to Kunming to contact Chairman Lu, and liaise with the 70th Army. This is your last chance. Turn back to the shore; do not make mistake after mistake.

                        Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Second Field Army, Deng Xiaoping, Political Commissar
                                                 December 30th

    刘伯承邓小平两将军忠告云南残余匪军
    只有立即起义才是出路
    【新华社北京三十一日电】人民解放军西南前线司令部司令员刘伯承、政治委员邓小平两将军，对被困在云南的国民党军第八军、二十六军将士发出忠告书，该书称：
    李弥将军、余程万将军，和国民党军第八军、二十六军全体将士们：
    中国大陆上的国民党军队，除了你们两个军以外，已经完全不存在了。我人民解放军在进军西南以来，不到两个月的时间，就扫光了国民党在大陆上的最后两支兵力——白崇禧匪部和胡宗南匪部。在卢汉、刘文辉、邓锡侯、潘文华将军的起义响应下，西南数省已经迅速解放。所有起义官兵，都受到人民解放军的欢迎，都有了光明的出路，都在安安稳稳地欢度新年。茫茫大地，只有你们孤零零的两个军，还没有找到归宿。全中国都解放了，蒋介石只剩下几个孤岛，眼看不久也就要解放，你们何苦还在云南乱转呢？你们想逃跑到越南去吗？人民解放军早已准备好堵击你们了，你们不要妄想可以逃脱。纵使有些残兵败将逃到越南，流亡外国，又有什么出路呢？被法国人缴械禁闭，固然是丢脸，被法国人编到保大的部队里当伪军，还不是同样丢脸吗？而且人民解放军是必然要追寻你们到天涯地角，就是你们再逃到台湾，也躲不了这一天。因此，摆在你们面前的光明大道只有一条，就是立即起义，脱离国民党反动残余，站到人民方面来。中国共产党和人民解放军向来实行宽大政策，不论何人，只要他真心悔过自新，确有事实表现，有利于人民解放事业，一概表示欢迎。现在你们可以考虑的时间已经很少了，希望你们赶快觉悟，赶快派代表到昆明，找卢主席接洽，并与七十军联络。这是你们的最后机会。回头是岸，望勿一误再误。
                第二野战军司令员刘伯承  政治委员邓小平
                                                 十二月三十日
