Following the production and sales conferences in various special districts of Shanxi, economic cadres have begun to clarify the importance of material exchange ideologically. They have seriously discussed the current material exchange policies and circulation directions. After the production and sales conferences in Yicheng, Changzhi, and other special districts, detailed four-month (November of last year to February of this year) material exchange plans were formulated for the county, district, and village levels. Among them, the Yicheng Special District can export 1.7 million catties of cotton, 70,000 shi of grain, more than 4 million catties of oil, and some walnuts and eggs during the winter. Especially in the two major cotton markets of Beiguan and Nanfan in Jiangxian County, which belong to the special district, the daily listing of cotton reaches a maximum of 5,000 to 10,000 catties. In Liulin Town of Changzhi Special District, there was a record of more than 920 heads of livestock being traded in just three days, and the transactions of other cloths, iron goods, and mountain goods were also considerable. In addition, since the autumn harvest, Hexun County, which belongs to the Yuci Special District, has had more than 100 shi of new grain entering the market every day, one-third of which flows north and two-thirds to Xingtai. According to statistics from November of last year alone, the quantity of goods traded was: 300,000 catties of cotton, 6.73 million catties of grain, 12,400 catties of wool, 198,000 catties of salt, 69,800 catties of hemp skin, 5.51 million bolts of various foreign cloth, 12 barrels of kerosene, and 170,000 catties of medicinal materials.

The above situation, as stated in the work summary of Changzhi Special District in November: "This organized and planned exchange of materials can be said to be unprecedented in history." These achievements have played a considerable role in the supply of raw materials for urban industries and daily necessities for farmers. However, there are still some shortcomings to be overcome in the current work. First, although some professional companies and cooperatives in some areas have signed contracts through agreements, some are not proactive and are mutually dependent. Second, the perspective in organizing exchanges is limited to the county and special societies. Furthermore, the price situation is not fully grasped, which sometimes allows unscrupulous merchants to take advantage of it, causing losses to the country and farmers.

    山西各专区产销会议后
    省内物资交流畅旺
    【本报讯】山西所属各专区经召开产销会议后，经济部门干部，对物资交流的重要意义，思想上已开始明确。认真地讨论了目前物资交流方针与流转方向。翼城、长治等专区于召开产销会议后，周密订出了县、区、村四个月（去年十一月至今年二月）的物资交流计划。其中翼城专区在冬季内即可输出棉花一百七十万斤，粮食七万石，油料四百余万斤及一部分核桃仁、鸡蛋。尤以该专区所属北关与绛县南樊两主要棉市。每日最多上市棉花达到五千至一万斤。长治专区柳林镇，曾有过三天仅牲畜即成交九百二十余头的纪录，其他布匹、铁货、山货成交亦不少。又榆次专区所属和顺县自秋收后至今，每日新粮上市达百余石，其中流向北面去的三分之一，流向邢台去的占三分之二，仅据去年十一月份统计，进销货的数量计：棉花三十万斤，粮食六百七十三万斤，羊毛一万二千四百斤，食盐十九万八千斤，麻皮六万九千八百斤，各色洋布五百五十一万匹，煤油十二桶，药材十七万斤。
    以上这些情况，正如十一月份长治专区工作总结中所说：“这次有组织、有计划的交流物资，也可说是历史上空前的。”这些成绩对城市工业原料及农民日用品的供给上，是起了相当作用的。但目前工作中仍然存在着若干缺点有待克服；首先是有些地区专业公司与合作社，虽经协议订立了合同。但有的彼此不主动，互相依赖，其次是在组织交流中眼光只局限在县社，专社之间，再者就是对物价情况掌握不全面，致使有时被奸商所乘，造成国家与农民的损失。
