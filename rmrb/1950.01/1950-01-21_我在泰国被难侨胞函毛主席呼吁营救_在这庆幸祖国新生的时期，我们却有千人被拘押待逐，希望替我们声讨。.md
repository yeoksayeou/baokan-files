Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 20th: Overseas Chinese compatriots unreasonably detained in Bangkok's large prison by the Thai government and brutally beaten have written to Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government of China, as well as Vice Chairmen Zhu, Liu, Song, Li, Zhang, and Gao, Premier Zhou, and all government members, calling for rescue. The full text of the letter is as follows:

To Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Vice Chairmen Zhu, Liu, Song, Li, Zhang, and Gao, Premier Zhou, and all government members:

We, representing all the overseas Chinese awaiting deportation detained in Thailand's large prison, are sending you an urgent plea for help. We earnestly hope that you will heed our sorrowful and angry cries and resolutely denounce the local government, which is what we urgently expect.

The founding of the People's Republic of China is a turning point in our country's history of thousands of years. In the past, we were persecuted by the reactionary regime and fled overseas to escape the evildoers. Now that our country is reborn, we should feel fortunate and comforted. However, unfortunately, who would have known that in this time of rejoicing, the local government would implement its consistent anti-Chinese policy, dragging us into prison on trumped-up charges. The reason is that they do not allow us to speak of Chairman Mao's nation-saving deeds and denounce Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous crimes.

Currently, we are being detained in the Bangkok Grand Prison, and the number of people awaiting deportation has reached thousands. The authorities are not expediting our deportation; instead, they deliberately confine us in the most brutal underground darkrooms, fitting us with 18th-century shackles and handcuffs. If we do not obediently submit to their bullying, they resort to inhumane means to deal with the enemies they view as "Aize" dogs (Chinese people). We are routinely beaten every day, even beaten to death or poisoned, which is commonplace. Especially in the silent darkness of the night, there are often cries of anguish and sorrow, such as: "It hurts so much... Compatriots, come and save me... After I die, please treat my bones as your own flesh and blood and seek revenge for me from... Chairman Mao..." When we see the bodies of our compatriots being dragged out immediately after death, we are filled with endless sorrow.

Under this inhumane policy, more than a dozen overseas Chinese have already died. We have repeatedly appealed to our compatriots with all our might, but have not received effective rescue and remain in this cruel hell, at their mercy.

Realizing that our motherland, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, is extremely concerned about overseas Chinese, we secretly held an emergency meeting and passed a resolution to appeal to you for help. We hope you will take some time to speak out for us and issue a protest to the Thai government on the radio, so that the local government can ease its persecution of us. We firmly believe that you can understand the suffering we are enduring and strive to complete this glorious task, taking genuine steps to protect overseas Chinese. We sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long life! Long live the leaders of the Central People's Government!

    我在泰国被难侨胞函毛主席呼吁营救
    “在这庆幸祖国新生的时期，我们却有千人被拘押待逐，希望替我们声讨。”
    【新华社北京二十日电】被泰国政府无理拘禁于曼谷大监狱并惨遭毒打的我国侨胞，致函我国中央人民政府毛主席及朱、刘、宋、李、张、高副主席、周总理及各政府委员，呼吁营救。该函全文如下：
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府毛主席、朱、刘、宋、李、张、高副主席、周总理暨各政委勋鉴：
    我们代表了被关在泰国大监狱的全体候逐华侨，向你们作紧急的呼救，望乞怜念我们悲哀愤怒的呼声，切实地向当地政府声讨，那是所急切期待的。
    中华人民共和国的宣告成立，是我们祖国数千年来历史的转折点，过去我们被反动政权迫害而逃亡海外，以避奸凶。由于现在祖国的新生，我们应该抱着庆幸的心情和安慰，然而不幸极了，谁知道在这欢笑的时期，被当地政府用了一贯排华的政策，对我们施以“莫须有”的罪名拖入监狱，原因是他们不许我们说及毛主席的救国事件和骂蒋介石的卖国罪行的。
    现在我们被拘押在泰京大监狱，而待候驱逐出境的人数已在千计，而被拘押的时间已近半年了。当局不采取急速把我们递解出境，故意地把我们关在最残酷的地下暗室，并将十八世纪的脚镣手铐带在我们身上，不循规蹈矩服从他们的欺侮，他们就采用惨无人道的手段，来对付他们目以“哀泽”狗（中国人）的敌人，我们每天经常被其殴打，甚至被殴杀或下药以毙，是家常便饭的事情。尤其在黑夜静寂的时候，常有哀号悲呼的声音，那就是：“痛死啊……同胞们快来救我……我死后，望你以骨肉看待，向……毛主席……替我……报仇”。当我们望见侨胞尸体于刚死后，被拖出去的时候，总抱着无限的伤感。
    在这种惨无人道的政策之下，死难的侨胞已有十余宗了。我们曾经力竭声嘶地向侨胞呼吁，终未能得到有效的救援，依然处在这残酷的地狱，任他们所蹂躏了。
    我们鉴于祖国在毛主席英明领导下对国外侨胞是极力看顾的，于是我们在秘密中开了紧急会议，通过向你们呼救，希望你们抽出一点工夫，替我们声讨，并于电台上向泰国政府提出抗议，俾使当地政府能因此而轻松对我们的毒害。深信你们能够体念我们这次所惨受的苦难而竭力完成这光荣的任务，达到真正护侨的步骤。谨祝毛主席万岁！中央人民政府各领袖万岁！
