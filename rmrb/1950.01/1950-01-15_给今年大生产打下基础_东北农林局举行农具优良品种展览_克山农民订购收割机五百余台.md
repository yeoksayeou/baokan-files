Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th—The Northeast People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry held an exhibition of new-style agricultural tools and superior varieties on December 22nd of last year. The agricultural tools on display included: a complete set of mechanical agricultural tools purchased from the Soviet Union for reclamation, planting, and harvesting, including horse-drawn single-furrow plows and double-furrow plows for reclamation and plowing, spike-tooth harrows and disc harrows for soil crushing, as well as seeders, weeders, hilling plows, harvesters, and manually operated threshers, corn shellers, and hand-cranked seed selectors, totaling thirteen types. Most were made of steel, characterized by high efficiency, saving manpower and animal power, and enabling deep and careful cultivation. For example, a double-furrow plow requires two people and four to six horses and can plow twelve mu of land per day. Another example is a harvester, which requires seven people and three to four horses and can harvest forty-five to fifty mu of land per day. These agricultural tools were enthusiastically welcomed by farmers when they were tested in rural areas of Heilongjiang Province. Farmers in Keshan County alone requested to order 520 harvesters. Another part of the agricultural tool category included various improved agricultural tools researched and created by farmers and agricultural experiment stations in various regions, such as weeders, combined shovel-hoeing (weeding and hilling) machines, improved rakes, Western plows, rice seeders, paddy field weeders, rice threshers, and hand-cranked weeders. Most were wooden implements. The common features of these agricultural tools are that they are lightweight, easy to manufacture, and low in cost, making them extremely popular among farmers. The superior varieties in the exhibition included a total of forty-five varieties of food crops such as soybeans, sorghum, wheat, rice, millet, and corn, as well as special product crops such as tobacco, sugar beets, silkworms, cotton, hemp, and apples. Most of these varieties have already begun to be promoted or are being prepared for promotion and are of very good quality. During the exhibition, the audience was crowded. Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, and Vice-Chairmen Li Fuchun and Lin Feng also visited the exhibition.
