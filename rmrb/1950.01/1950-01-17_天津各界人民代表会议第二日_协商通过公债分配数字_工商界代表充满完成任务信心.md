Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th – Today was the second day of the Tianjin People's Representatives Conference. After listening to Vice Mayor Liu Xiufeng's report on the municipal government's work over the past three months, the conference heard a report on the promotion of public bonds by Li Gengtao, director of the Public Bond Promotion Committee. He pointed out that since the allocation of 7.3 million shares of the Victory Public Bonds to Tianjin, individual purchases have reached nearly 600,000 shares as of the 15th. This demonstrates the people of Tianjin's love for the new China. Regarding the allocation of public bond quotas, after consultation among representatives from all walks of life, the proposed subscription figures are as follows: 5.8 million shares for the industrial and commercial sectors, 800,000 shares for well-to-do households and wealthy retired civil and military officials, and the remaining 700,000 shares for free subscription by workers, teachers, students, government cadres, and the military. The subscription of public bonds is planned to adopt the method of one-time subscription with payment in installments. In their speeches, the representatives unanimously expressed their support for the figures allocated by the Public Bond Promotion Committee. Li Zhuchen, manager of Jiuda Salt Industry Company and representative of the industrial sector, stated: "Purchasing public bonds solves the country's financial problems, and only then can we enjoy the benefits of economic stability. We must happily accept this glorious task and enthusiastically subscribe." Gao Youshan, manager of Xinglong Trading Company and representative of the commercial sector, said, "We in the industrial and commercial sectors will not only complete this task, but also exceed this figure!" He also suggested that the conference send a telegram to the Central People's Government on behalf of the conference, expressing full confidence in completing this glorious task, which was unanimously approved by the conference. Worker representative Wang Laowu stated: "The government's issuance of public bonds is wholeheartedly supported by the workers. Many workers used their year-end bonuses to purchase public bonds. Those who have more difficult living conditions and are unable to purchase them must work hard to increase the country's wealth." Representatives Yang Chengwu of the Tianjin Garrison, Zhang Guofan of the University Teachers Association, Hei Yanchang of the Hui people, Yang Baozhong of the school workers, Qiao Mingxun of private industry, and Zhang Chunshan of the military dependents also unanimously expressed their full confidence in completing this glorious task.
