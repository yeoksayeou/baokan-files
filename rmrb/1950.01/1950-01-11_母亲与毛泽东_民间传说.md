Mother and Mao Zedong
—A Folk Legend
Wu Wei

One cold winter night, in a thatched cottage by a small village, a mother was very worried, holding her very sick child. The child's face was very pale, his eyes were closed, and his breathing was difficult, with only a wisp of life left. The mother watched her little life about to die, and her heart became even more worried.

The knife-like wind scraped in through the door cracks and broken windows. The mother had not slept for three days and three nights. She was shivering with cold, but she still cared for her child with extreme concern, wanting him to live no matter what. She already had two children, who had both died because there was no food to eat on weekdays, and no money to see a doctor when they got sick. This one had to live, no matter what. But the child's breathing became shorter and shorter, and finally he stretched out his small hand and died. The mother's heart felt like it had been stabbed by a knife, and tears kept rolling down her face, dripping on the child's pale face. The mother just couldn't understand why the children of the landlords in the village didn't die, the children of the compradors and bureaucrats in the city didn't die, only their children died? It is said that "God" is merciful, but why does he always call our children to die? The mother decided to go and ask "God" about this reason.

The mother walked for more than a month but still couldn't find "God." One day she came to a large village, and in the middle of the village was a tall and large stone house, which was the landlord's house. The landlord's wife was standing at the gate, holding a pug dog in her arms.

The mother asked the landlord's wife, "Please tell me, where is 'God'?"

The landlord's wife rolled her old eyes and said, "What do you country bumpkins want to find 'God' for?"

"I want to ask 'God': It doesn't matter if we live in poverty and hardship, but why do you have to take our children away?" the mother replied sadly.

"Alright!" said the landlord's wife. "But you have to exchange your bright black hair for me. You know your hair is very beautiful, and I like it very much. I can exchange my white hair for yours."

The mother took off her black hair and exchanged it for the landlord's wife's white hair. Then the landlord's wife casually pointed out a road to the mother.

The mother, wearing white hair, walked for another month, but still couldn't find "God." She met a priest from a foreign church.

The mother asked the priest, "Please tell me, where is 'God'?"

"Alright!" said the priest. "But you have to give me your two bright and clear eyeballs. You know how inconvenient my presbyopic eyes are to me. I can exchange my reading glasses for yours."

The mother agreed and exchanged her two bright eyes for the priest's pair of reading glasses. Then the priest also casually pointed her to a road.

After walking for another month, the mother, with her blurred eyes, still couldn't find "God," so she went to ask the bureaucrat's wife.

The mother said, "Madam, please tell me, where is 'God'?"

"Alright, but you have to give me your skin. Your skin is so young and smooth. I can give you my wrinkled and lined skin. It's better than having no skin at all," said the bureaucrat's wife, wrinkling her old and lined skin.

The mother agreed, and they exchanged skin. Then the bureaucrat's wife also casually pointed out a road to the mother.

The mother looked everywhere for "God," but couldn't find him anywhere. One day she came to the city, and the mother searched carefully for "God" in the city. Suddenly she heard a "toot—" sound, and many workers came out of the factory. The mother grabbed a worker and asked, "Please tell me, where is 'God'?"

The worker asked in surprise, "'God'? What do you want to find 'God' for?"

The mother told the worker the reason.

"Oh—" the worker nodded and said to her in a low voice, "Come with me, I'll take you there."

They walked into an ordinary room, where a person was sitting, looking down at a book. The person was very tall, very healthy, and dressed very plainly and cleanly. Seeing them come in, he stood up and said very kindly, "Comrades, please come in, what's the matter?"

The worker introduced the mother: "This is Mao Zedong—our real God."

The mother was very happy and told Mao Zedong her problem. Mao Zedong opened his eyes wide and carefully asked about the hardships of the countryside, and then asked the mother, "Who took the crops and grains you grew in the fields? Why do they dare to take what you produce?"

The mother began to understand, and knew more clearly why her hair turned white, why her skin wrinkled, and why her eyes became blurred.

Mao Zedong also told her how to fight for her children and overthrow those who plunder what we produce.

The mother returned home and told her neighbors what Mao Zedong said. One person told ten, and ten told a hundred, and Mao Zedong's words spread.

In the cities, especially in the factories, Mao Zedong's words had already spread. After a few years, the armed struggle began, and Mao Zedong personally led them to fight. After countless years of the most hardship, Mao Zedong always led them, never leaving them; they were closely united around him, followed him, and finally Mao Zedong's words prevailed.

From then on, labor was no longer equal to poverty.

From then on, goodbye to hunger and injustice.

From that time on, the mother's children, under the warm sun of Mao Zedong, jumped and sang lively and lovely, they were singing: "Mao Zedong is our sun..."

    母亲与毛泽东
    ——民间传说
    吴为
    一个寒冷的冬夜，小村边的茅屋里，一个母亲非常忧愁的抱着她病得很厉害的小孩。孩子的脸色很苍白，他的眼睛闭着，他的呼吸很艰难，只剩得一缕气息。母亲眼看着她的小生命要死了，心里就愈加忧愁。
    像尖刀一样的风从门缝破窗里刮进来，母亲已经三天三夜没有睡了，她冻得发抖，但她还是极关心地看护着她的孩子，她想他一定要活着。她已经有两个孩子，都因为平日没有吃的，生了病又没有钱请医生而死去了，这个无论如何得活下去。但是孩子的呼吸越来越短促，终于伸了伸他的小手死去了。母亲的心像刀刺一样，眼泪不断的从面孔上滚下去，滴在孩子苍白的脸上。母亲总不能明白为什么村里地主的孩子不死，城里买办官僚的孩子不死，光死我们的孩子呢？据说：“老天爷”是仁慈的，但为什么老叫我们的孩子死呢？母亲决定去找“老天爷”问问这个道理。
    母亲走了一个多月还没有找到“老天爷”，一天走到一个大村庄，村中间有一座又高又大的石头房子，这是地主的房子。大门口站着一个地主的老婆，手里抱着一只哈巴狗。
    母亲问地主的老婆说：“请告诉我，‘老天爷’在那里？”
    地主的老婆翻了翻她的老眼说：“你这乡下佬找‘老天爷’干什么？”
    “我要去问问‘老天爷’：我们在贫穷里苦命里熬日子不要紧，但为什么还要把我们的孩子拿去呢？”母亲悲痛的回答。
    “好吧！”地主的老婆说：“不过你得把你的光亮的黑头发换给我，你知道你的头发很为美丽，我极喜欢它，我可以把我的白头发和你交换。”
    母亲把黑头发取下来，跟地主的老婆交换了白头发。于是地主的老婆随便的跟母亲指了一条路。
    母亲披了白头发，又走了一个多月，但还没有找到“老天爷”，迎面碰见了一个洋教堂里的神甫。
    母亲问神甫：“请告诉我，‘老天爷’在那里？”
    “好吧！”神甫说：“不过你得把你两颗明亮清楚的眼珠送给我，你知道我的老花眼睛对我是多么不方便，我可以把我的老花眼睛跟你交换。”
    母亲同意了，把两颗明亮的眼珠换了神甫的一双花眼睛。于是神甫也随便跟她指了一条路。
    又走了一个多月，母亲花了眼睛还是找不到“老天爷”，因此又去问官僚的太太。
    母亲说：“太太，请告诉我，‘老天爷’在那里！”
    “好吧，不过你得把你的脸皮送给我，你的脸皮是这样的年轻和平滑，我可以把我的皱而多纹的脸皮送给你，这比没有脸皮要好一些。”官僚的太太皱了皱她年老多纹的脸皮说。
    母亲同意了，她们交换了脸皮。于是官僚的太太也随便的跟母亲指了一条路。
    母亲到处找“老天爷”，可是到处找不到。一天走到城里，母亲在城里仔细的找“老天爷”。忽听得“嘟——”的声响，很多工人从工厂中出来，母亲又拉住工人问：“请告诉我，‘老天爷’在那里？”
    工人惊奇的问：“‘老天爷’？你找‘老天爷’干什么？”
    母亲把原因跟工人说了说。
    “噢——”工人点了点头低声对她说：“跟我来，我引你去。”
    他们走到一个普通的房间里，里面坐着一个人，低着头在看书。那人个儿很高，很健康，穿得很朴素干净，看见他们进来就站起来，很和蔼可亲的说道：“同志们请进来，有什么事吗？”
    工人跟母亲介绍：“这是毛泽东——咱们真正的老天爷。”
    母亲很高兴的把自己的问题对毛泽东说了说。毛泽东张大了眼睛，很仔细的问着农村的疾苦，然后又问母亲：“你们在田地里种出的庄稼粮食，被谁拿去了？
    他们又为什么敢拿你们生产出来的东西？”
    母亲开始明白了，并且更清楚地知道自己的头发为什么会白，脸皮为什么会皱，眼为什么会花。
    毛泽东还告诉了她应该怎样为着孩子们奋斗，并把掠夺我们生产出来东西的人打倒。
    母亲回到家里，对她的邻居讲毛泽东的话。一传十，十传百，毛泽东的话传开了。
    在城市里，尤其是工厂里，毛泽东的话早就传开了。传了几年，武装斗争开始了，毛泽东亲自率领着他们去斗争，经过了无数最苦难的年头，毛泽东永远领着他们，不离开他们；他们紧紧的团结在他周围，跟着他，终于毛泽东的话胜利了。
    从此，劳动不再等于贫苦。
    从此永别了饥饿与不平。
    从那时起，母亲的孩子在毛泽东的煦阳下，活泼可爱的跳着、唱着，他们在唱：“毛泽东是我们的太阳……。”
