Regarding the winter literacy movement in the new districts of Shanxi, transmitted by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Education Inspection Team:

    The winter literacy movement in the new districts is now generally underway and has achieved initial results. However, some problems still exist, and we present them here for study.

            I. Does Winter Literacy Contradict Central Work?

    At all levels of leadership in the new district counties and districts, there is still a disconnect between central work and winter literacy in terms of guiding ideology. In counties such as Yuci and Pingyao, for fear of hindering central work, cultural and educational assistants were not allowed to participate when conveying the winter literacy guidelines. Some cadres in Taigu believe that winter literacy cannot be carried out in villages undergoing land reform. Winter literacy teachers in Daicun and Hancun in the Eighth District asked the village head to strengthen the leadership of the winter literacy committee, but the village head said: We can't even finish the important work, how can we take care of these things, and he pushed it aside. More seriously, some cadres do not attend school, and the masses reflect: Winter literacy is good, why don't the cadres go? Most of the winter literacy committees at all levels exist in name only and are mere formalities. If it is said that winter literacy contradicts central work, or that central work is the only educational content of winter literacy, it is inappropriate to absolutely isolate or confuse the two. According to the instructions of the Provincial Department of Education on winter literacy education, winter literacy should be used to raise the political consciousness of the masses, making it a good base for promoting central work. The fundamental reason for the current disconnect between winter literacy education and central work education in various regions is mainly due to the lack of organic connection between the two.

            II. Two Deviations: Administrative Orders and Laissez-faire

    Generally, villages in the new districts have no experience in running winter literacy programs, and the masses do not have the habit of attending school. Most people regard winter literacy as a burden. As a result, two deviations have arisen: one is administrative orders. In some places in Qi County, the winter literacy covenant stipulates "admonishment for one absence, criticism for two absences, and a fine of two liang of oil for three absences"; in Nanxi Village, Taigu, a fine of one day's work is imposed for one absence; Yuci Chengguan adopts the organizational means of the security group checking household registration to force the masses to attend school. The other deviation is laissez-faire. At the opening ceremony of the winter literacy program in Beiguan, Yuci, the winter literacy teacher announced: This year's winter literacy is voluntary, those who wish to come may come, and those who do not wish to come do not have to come. As a result, only twenty students attended out of eight hundred. In Hexiangbao, Taigu, a winter literacy teacher has not been "selected" even after a month since the start of the program. To overcome these deviations, it is necessary to widely publicize the winter literacy policy, combine general appeals with specific mobilization, conduct in-depth investigations and research, understand the ideological changes of the masses, and grasp their positive factors. For example, the masses in the Twelfth Street of Pingyao Winter Literacy program wanted to listen when it discussed land reform, and the masses in the Thirteenth Street asked to learn about class division and women and children's health common sense. This proves that as long as the teaching content of winter literacy matches the practical needs of the masses, the masses urgently need to learn. Therefore, winter literacy should be carried out in a planned and led manner based on the needs and voluntary participation of the masses in order to avoid the above deviations.

            III. Teacher Issues

    Since the start of winter literacy programs in various places, a common problem is that teachers cannot teach effectively, and the masses are impatient to listen. In some villages, people were very enthusiastic about attending lectures at the beginning of the winter literacy program, but the number of students gradually decreased because the teachers could not continue to meet the needs of the masses. For example, in Guozhuang Village, Taigu, there were 162 students attending class at the beginning, but later only ten or so were left. Because teachers cannot teach political lessons, it becomes a simple matter of teaching literacy, and the teaching does not differentiate between levels, the teaching materials are the same, which causes dissatisfaction among students with higher levels. Some people say, I already knew this word ten years ago, I can't stand not coming, but it's a waste of effort to come. To solve the teacher problem, county and district governments should earnestly establish training stations in a planned and led manner, determine special personnel to help teachers through the training stations, so that they themselves have a clear understanding of the content that should be taught in winter literacy, and the winter literacy teaching can be carried out smoothly. It is not enough for county and district leaders to simply conduct inspections on time. This is a problem that needs to be solved urgently.

            IV. The Relationship Between Winter Literacy and Village Elementary Schools

    According to the situation in Taigu, winter literacy currently has no fixed school site, and most winter literacy programs are attached to elementary schools. This interferes with elementary schools to some extent, such as furniture being easily damaged, and elementary school teachers and students not being able to study at night. In Xugou County, there are fifty winter literacy programs throughout the county, but only twenty-eight teachers, the rest are elementary school teachers concurrently serving as winter literacy teachers, and these teachers have not received training in winter literacy education. This not only hinders national education but also delays winter literacy education. Whether it is the issue of school sites or teachers, it is best to run winter literacy and elementary schools separately. Leaders of counties and districts should earnestly and quickly check and correct the "supporting the poor" and "dealing with official business" ideological attitudes of the education cadres below, and establish a truly teaching ideology.

    山西新区冬学运动中的几个问题
    山西教育厅视导组  樊进业、董力发、郭光轩、郭永太、李彬
    目前新区的冬学运动，一般已基本展开，并获得初步成绩。但还存在一些问题，提出以供研究。
            一、冬学与中心工作是否矛盾
    新区县、区各级领导，在指导思想上还存在着中心工作与冬学的脱节现象。榆次、平遥等县因怕妨碍中心工作，传达冬学方针时不敢让文教助理员参加。太谷有些干部认为进行土地改革的村庄不能办冬学。八区代村、韩村的冬学教员要求村长加强冬学委员会的领导，村长说：正经事还办不完，那里顾上这些事，一推不管。更严重的是一部分干部不上学，群众反映说：冬学好，为啥干部不去？各级冬学委员会多半有名无实，流于形式。如果说，冬学与中心工作有矛盾，或认为中心工作就是冬学的唯一教育内容，二者绝对孤立与混为一谈都不妥当。根据省教育厅关于冬学教育的指示，应通过冬学来提高群众的政治觉悟，使冬学成为推动中心工作的良好阵地。目前各地冬学教育与中心工作教育脱节的基本原因，主要由于两者没有取得有机的联系。
            二、行政命令与放任自流两种偏向
    新区各村一般都没有办理冬学经验，群众没有上学习惯，大部分人把冬学当成负担。因此产生了两种偏向：一种是行政命令。祁县有的地方，冬学公约订为“一次不到讲理，二次不到批评，三次不到罚油二两”；太谷南席村一次不到罚工一天；榆次城关采用治安组查户口的组织手段，强迫群众上学。另一种偏向是放任自流。榆次北关冬学开学典礼会上，冬学教员宣布：今年冬学是自愿报名，愿者来，不愿者不来，结果八百名学员只到了二十名。太谷贺象堡开学一月，三次都没有“选”出个冬学教员。为克服这种偏向，必须广泛宣传冬学方针，使一般号召与具体动员结合起来，深入调查研究，了解群众思想变化，掌握其积极因素。像平遥十二街冬学讲土地改革，十三街群众要求去听；太谷程家庄大部分学员要求学划阶级和妇孺卫生常识。这证明只要冬学的教学内容与群众的切身要求相吻合，群众是迫切需要学习的。所以冬学应根据群众的需要与自愿，有计划有领导的进行，才能免除以上偏向。
            三、教员问题
    各地冬学开学以来，普遍存在的问题是教员教不了，群众不耐听。有些村冬学开始时，听讲的人很踊跃，因教员不能继续满足群众的要求。学员逐渐减少。如太谷郭庄村，刚开学时上课的有一百六十二名，后来只剩十来人了。因教员教不了政治课，形成单纯教识字，并且教时不分程度高低，教材一样，引起程度较高的学员不满。如有的人说，这字前十年我就会，不来吧顶不住，来了吧白搭工。解决教员问题，各县、区政府应有计划有领导地认真建立传授站，确定专人通过传授站帮助教员，使他们本身对冬学应教的内容先有清楚了解，冬学的教学才能顺利开展。县区领导仅仅按时进行检查是不够的。这是目前急待解决的问题。
            四、冬学与村小学的关系
    根据太谷的情形看来，冬学目前尚无固定校址，一般的冬学都附设在小学内。这样对小学多少有些妨碍，如家具容易损坏，小学师生夜间不能学习等。徐沟全县冬学五十处，只有教员二十八人，其余的都是小学教员兼任，这些教员都未受过关于冬学教育的训练。这样既有碍国民教育，又会耽误了冬学教育。无论校址问题和教员问题，冬学与小学最好分开办理。各县区领导应认真迅速检查，纠正下面教育干部的“支差”和“应付公事”的思想态度，树立起真正教学的思想。
