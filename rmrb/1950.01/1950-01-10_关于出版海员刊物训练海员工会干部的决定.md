    Decision on Publishing a Seafarer Publication and Training Seafarer Trade Union Cadres
    (Adopted at the National Conference of Seafarer Trade Union Representatives from All Regions on December 26, 1949,
    Approved by the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on January 5, 1950)
    1. In order to solve the difficulties in the work of the Seafarer Trade Union caused by the dispersed and mobile nature of seafarer workers, the National Committee of the Chinese Seafarer Trade Union shall publish a seafarer publication, "Chinese Seafarer," to facilitate propaganda, education, and organizational work among seafarers. Before the "Chinese Seafarer" sponsored by the National Committee is published, the "Shanghai Seafarer" sponsored by the Shanghai Seafarer Trade Union will be responsible for the tasks of the "Chinese Seafarer" publication.
    2. In order to cultivate intermediate and senior-level cadres of the Seafarer Trade Union, please have the cadre school of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions set up a special seafarer class in each term.
    3. Local seafarer trade unions should strengthen the education of seafarers. If it is not possible to run training classes on their own, they should ask the workers' training classes run by the local Federation of Trade Unions to reserve a certain number of places to rotate seafarers for training.

    关于出版海员刊物训练海员工会干部的决定
    （一九四九年十二月二十六日全国各地海员工会代表会议通过
    一九五○年一月五日中华全国总工会常务委员会扩大会议批准）
    一、为了解决由于海员工人的分散与流动性之特点所造成的海员工会工作之困难，中国海员工会全国委员会应出版一种海员的刊物——《中国海员》，以利对于海员之宣传教育与组织工作。在全国委员会主办之《中国海员》未出版前，责成上海海员工会主办之“上海海员”担负《中国海员》刊物的任务。
    二、为了培养海员工会的中级高级干部，请全国总工会之干部学校，每期专门设一个海员班次。
    三、各地海员工会应加强对海员的教育工作，如不可能自办训练班，则请当地总工会举办之工人训练班，留给一定名额，轮流抽调海员受训。
