Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 20th: Hu Qiaomu, Director of the Central People's Government News Administration, made a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters today, refuting US Secretary of State Acheson's shameless rumors.

Director Hu Qiaomu said: US Secretary of State Acheson fabricated a series of rumors in his lengthy speech at the US National Press Club on January 12th. The fact that US imperialist officials, represented by people like Acheson, are becoming, day by day, the most incompetent political swindlers who cannot survive without resorting to the most shameless rumors, shows the degree to which the US imperialist system has spiritually degenerated. Acheson's entire speech is based on using rumors to cover up the reality of American aggression. For example, he said: "Our interests are consistent with the interests of the peoples of Asian countries." When referring to China, he said that the interests of the United States and the interests of the Chinese people "run parallel and do not contradict each other." "From the announcement of the Open Door Policy, through the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty, to the recent resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, this has been a principle, and we have always been consistent with it." Not a single word of this is true. Using every possible means to infiltrate China and turn China into an American colony, this is the fundamental policy of the United States. Using six billion US dollars in recent years to help Chiang Kai-shek kill millions of Chinese people, this is what is meant by the so-called American interests and the interests of the Chinese people "run parallel and do not contradict each other."

Director Hu Qiaomu said: The most shameless rumors we are talking about are not the above, but the rumors he fabricated about Sino-Soviet relations.

Acheson said: "The Soviet Union is merging the northern regions of China, and the method implemented in Outer Mongolia is almost being implemented in Manchuria as well. I believe that Soviet agents will make good reports from Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang to Moscow. This is the current situation, that is, vast areas of the entire Chinese population are separating from China and merging with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's occupation of four regions in northern China is an important fact for the powers related to Asia, and it is very important to us."

The US State Department has its own history of speaking on Sino-Soviet relations. There is no basis for saying that the Soviet Union helped the Chinese Communist Party—this is what the gentlemen of the US State Department often said before 1948, because at that time, in the eyes of the gentlemen of the State Department, the American war gamble in China still seemed to have hope. The Soviet Union is trying to control China—this is what the State Department said in the White Paper on China issued in 1949, because at this time the gentlemen of the State Department already felt that their gambling was about to be lost. The Soviet Union occupies four regions in northern China—this is what was said on January 12, 1950, because the United States had completely lost its gambling on the Chinese mainland, leaving only Taiwan, where it still seemed to want to do something. Thank God, the American imperialists, under the sweep of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, have no better way than to fabricate such rumors. The low-level rumors and slanders that the Chinese Communist Party is a Soviet stooge and that the Soviet Union has annexed, is annexing, or will annex China can only arouse the indignation of the Chinese and Soviet people and strengthen the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, and will have no other result.

The thoroughly rotten and contradictory imperialist system is showing itself to be so interesting: The day after Acheson's incompetent speech, January 14, 1950, former US Consul General in Shenyang, Ward, who was arrested, tried, and deported by the Chinese People's Government, gave Acheson a crisp slap in the face. According to a TASS dispatch from Washington on January 14th: "Former US Consul General in Shenyang, Ward, spoke with State Department officials after returning to the United States. After this conversation, when answering questions from reporters, he said that apart from exercising the treaty rights of joint management of railways, he did not see any signs of the Soviet Union supervising Manchuria. Ward also pointed out that he did not see any signs of the Soviet Union annexing Manchuria. When asked whether the Manchurian Communist regime was supervised by Beijing, Ward said: All Communist governments are under highly centralized management. As far as he knows, Manchuria is a part of Communist China."

People can see what kind of accident has occurred on the land of the Western Hemisphere. One says: Manchuria is merging with the Soviet Union. One says: did not see it. These two are none other than famous officials of the US State Department.

### 中央人民政府新闻总署署长胡乔木  驳斥美国务卿艾奇逊的无耻造谣

    驳斥美国务卿艾奇逊的无耻造谣
    【新华社北京二十日电】中央人民政府新闻总署署长胡乔木，本日向新华社记者发表谈话，驳斥美国国务卿艾奇逊的无耻造谣。
    胡乔木署长说：美国国务卿艾奇逊一月十二日在美国全国新闻俱乐部的长篇讲演中造了一连串的谣言。美国帝国主义的官员们举艾奇逊这类人为代表，一天一天地变成了如果不乞灵于最无耻的谣言就不能活下去的最低能的政治骗子，这件事实表示了美国帝国主义制度在精神方面堕落到了什么样的程度。艾奇逊的通篇讲演都是以谣言掩盖美国侵略政策的实际。例如他说：“我们的利益与亚洲各国人民的利益是符合的。”在提到中国时，他说：美国的利益和中国人民的利益“是并行不背的”。“自从宣布门户开放政策之时起，经过九国公约之签订，以至联合国大会的最近的决议都是这一个原则，并且我们对它始终不渝。”这里没有一个字不是撒谎。用一切办法钻进中国来，将中国变为美国殖民地，这就是美国的基本政策。用六十万万美元在最近数年中帮助蒋介石杀害了几百万中国人，这就是所谓美国的利益和中国人民的利益“是并行不背的”。
    胡乔木署长说：我们说的艾奇逊的最无耻的谣言还不是上面这些，而是他在中苏关系上所造的谣言。
    艾奇逊说：“苏联正在将中国北部地区实行合并，这种在外蒙所实行了的办法，在满洲亦几乎实行了。我相信苏联的代理人会从内蒙和新疆向莫斯科作很好的报告。这就是现在的情形，即整个中国居民的广大地区和中国脱离与苏联合并。苏联占据中国北部的四个区域，对于与亚洲有关的强国来说是重要的事实，对于我们来说是非常重要的。”
    美国国务院对于中苏关系上的说话有它自己的历史。苏联帮助了中国共产党这一点是没有任何根据的——这是一九四八年以前美国国务院的老爷们常说的话，这是因为那时候在国务院老爷们看来，美国在中国的战争赌博似乎还有希望的原故。苏联企图控制中国——这是一九四九年国务院为中国问题而发表白皮书中所说的话，这是因为这时候国务院老爷们已经感觉自己的赌博快要输光了的原故。苏联占据中国北部的四个区域——这是一九五○年一月十二日的话，这是因为美国在中国大陆上的赌博已经彻底输光，剩下一个台湾，似乎还想在那里打点什么主意的原故。谢谢上帝，美国帝国主义者们在中国人民和中国人民解放军的扫荡之下，除了造作这样的谣言之外，已经没有别的更好办法了。所谓中国共产党是苏联的走狗，苏联已经或正在或将要吞并中国这类低能的造谣诬蔑，只能激起中苏两国人民的愤慨，加强中苏两国的友好合作，此外不会有别的结果。
    腐朽透顶、矛盾百出的帝国主义制度，是表现得这样的有趣：在艾奇逊低能演说后的第二天，即一九五○年一月十四日，被中国人民政府逮捕审判并驱逐出境的前美国驻沈阳总领事瓦尔德赏了艾奇逊一个清脆的耳光。据塔斯社一月十四日华盛顿电称：“前美驻沈阳总领事瓦尔德返美后，曾与国务院官员谈话。此次谈话后，在回答记者的问题时，他说，除掉行使共管铁路的条约权利以外，并未看见苏联有监督满洲的任何迹象。瓦尔德同时指出，并未看见苏联有吞并满洲的任何迹象。他回答满洲共产党的政权是否受北京的监督时，瓦尔德称：所有共产党的政府，都是受高度的集中管理。据他所知：满洲乃系共产党中国之一部分。”
    人们可以看见：在西半球的土地上发生了怎样的事故。一个说：满洲与苏联合并。一个说：并未看见。这两个不是别人，都是美国国务院的有名的官员。
