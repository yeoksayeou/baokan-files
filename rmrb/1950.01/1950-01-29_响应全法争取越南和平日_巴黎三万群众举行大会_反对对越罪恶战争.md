    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th. In response to the National Day for Peace in Vietnam called for by the French Joint Action Committee for Peace in Vietnam, the people of Paris held a mass rally on the 25th. According to a TASS dispatch from Paris: The rally was held at the Winter Velodrome in Paris, with 30,000 people attending. More than a thousand representatives of mothers, wives, and widows of soldiers from all over France attended the rally, joining the people of Paris in demanding an immediate end to the criminal war in Vietnam.
    The presidium of the conference consisted of French Communist Party leaders Thorez, Duclos, Frachon, Vermeersch (Mrs. Thorez), Baulier, the mother of the French heroine Casanova, widows and mothers of soldiers killed in Vietnam, a delegation of dockworkers from Dunkirk, a delegation of Vietnamese women, and delegations of women from Madagascar and Equatorial Africa. The conference was opened by Mrs. Gordon, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation and President of the French Women's Federation.
    Amidst warm applause, Rick Legreg, a representative of French Catholic women, paid tribute to the dockworkers of Dunkirk and the workers of the Renault factory who opposed the transportation of war materials to Vietnam. She said: "The French people's struggle for peace in Vietnam will not be stopped by the government's threats. French women are determined to continue and strengthen the struggle against imperialist war."
    Mrs. Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, described her meetings with Asian women representatives at the Asian Women's Conference in Beijing in her speech.
    Mrs. Thorez said in her speech: "During our stay in Beijing, we became more convinced that the cause of the democratic camp is invincible and will surely be victorious. The camp of warmongers will surely be crushed." She denounced the criminal war waged by France in Vietnam, saying: "It is not the interests of France that are being defended by force in Vietnam, but the interests of large capitalist companies that are against the interests of the French people. We will continue to fight against the war in Vietnam and against colonial policies." Her speech was constantly interrupted by enthusiastic applause. Finally, Mrs. Thorez called for consolidating unity, strengthening the struggle for peace, overthrowing the current French government that betrays national interests, and replacing it with a government that truly represents the interests of the French people.

    响应全法争取越南和平日
    巴黎三万群众举行大会
    反对对越罪恶战争
    【新华社北京二十八日电】巴黎人民响应法国争取越南和平联合行动委员会所号召的全国争取越南和平日，于二十五日举行了群众大会。据塔斯社巴黎讯：大会在巴黎冬季赛车场举行，与会者三万人。全法各地士兵的母亲、妻子与寡妇派来代表一千余人参加大会，与巴黎人民一齐要求立即停止在越南进行的罪恶战争。
    大会主席团由法共领袖多列士、杜克洛、佛拉商、维美徐（多列士夫人）、鲍里埃、法国女英雄之母卡桑诺伐、在越南战死的士兵的寡妇与母亲、敦刻尔克码头工人代表团、越南妇女代表团、马达加斯加与赤道非洲的妇女代表团组成。大会由国际民主妇联主席、法国妇联主席戈登夫人主持开幕。
    法国天主教妇女代表里克勒格在热烈掌声中向反对运送战争物资到越南去的敦刻尔克码头工人和雷诺工厂的职工致敬。她说：“法国人民争取越南和平的斗争，不会因政府的威胁而停止。法国妇女有着坚定的决心来继续并加强反对帝国主义战争的斗争。”
    国际民主妇联总书记瓦扬——古久里夫人在演说中叙述了她在北京亚洲妇女代表会议上与亚洲妇女代表会晤的情形。
    多列士夫人演说称：“在我们旅居北京的时候，我们更加深信民主阵营的事业是不可战胜的，而且一定会胜利。战争贩子的阵营必定会被粉碎”。她痛斥法国在越南进行的罪恶战争称：“用武力在越南保卫的不是法国的利益，而是违反法国人民利益的大资本公司的利益。我们将继续进行斗争，反对越南的战争，反对殖民政策。”她的演讲不时为热烈的掌声所打断。最后多列士夫人号召巩固团结，加强争取和平的斗争，推翻出卖民族利益的法国现政府，代之以真正代表法国人民利益的政府。
