    Shijiazhuang Dazhong Textile Mill After Being Returned
    By our correspondent in Shijiazhuang, Ai Fang
    In order to understand the workers' lives, labor-capital relations, and production situation of the Dazhong Textile Mill after it was returned to private ownership, this reporter visited various production departments and workshops of the factory for several days, and interviewed workers, the trade union, and the factory management.
    The Dazhong Textile Mill is a relatively large factory in Shijiazhuang. After two years of government trusteeship, the factory already has 1,672 employees with considerable cultural and technical skills. In terms of equipment, it has 35 sets of spinning frames, 15 sets of roving frames, 320 looms, and machines for cleaning, drawing, winding, sizing, and packing. The factory has restored 11,872 spindles. The power department of the factory has four generators with a maximum power generation capacity of 1,500 kilowatts. Coal is transported from Jingxing via a railway branch line directly into the factory for unloading. The newly opened Jinghan Railway and the passing vehicles on the Shide and Zhengtai Railways run alongside it. These favorable conditions have opened up broad development prospects for the Dazhong Textile Mill.
    Just as the factory's production was rapidly moving forward and the whole country was cheering the comprehensive victory of the People's Liberation War, the capital side of Dazhong Textile Mill, which had been missing for two years, returned and applied for the return of private ownership. After the government verified that the facts were true, it resolutely decided to return it, and in August, the government representative—Comrade Huo Ran, the factory director during the state-owned period—and the capital representative, Mr. Tao Zhinong, began negotiations and handled all the procedures. On November 9, the factory was officially returned to Hankou Dazhong Co., Ltd.
    In the past two years, in order to rapidly restore and develop production at the Dazhong Textile Mill, the government and the workers have made many efforts. At the beginning of the liberation of Shijiazhuang, enemy planes bombed the factory for seven consecutive days, with machines flying and houses collapsing. In order to develop production and alleviate the unemployment risk facing the workers, the government immediately made large investments and dispatched capable cadres to organize and lead the workers in restoration and construction. In the past two years, the government's investment in equipment repair and addition alone has reached more than 5 million catties of millet. With the active efforts of the workers, production has been increasing daily and has now exceeded the pre-liberation production level. As a result of the workers' efforts to develop production, the workers' lives have also gradually improved. Various democratic systems have been established in the factory. The Dazhong Textile Mill has completely changed its old appearance.
    These many ironclad facts fully and powerfully demonstrate that the government is vigorously developing production and resolutely implementing the policy of protecting national industry and commerce.
    The return of the factory is indeed a major change for the Dazhong Textile Mill. What reactions have this change caused among the workers and in various aspects? Comrade Wang Yaolin, the chairman of the factory's trade union, answered the reporter in an affirmative tone: "After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, Dazhong was state-owned, and now it has been transferred to private ownership. This has caused a fundamental change in the nature of the factory. Therefore, the relationship between the factory management and the workers has also changed from the past public-private relationship to a labor-capital relationship. The workers say: In the past, production was for the state, to support the front; now, the capitalists are engaged in production to make money for themselves. When the workers recall the painful days before the liberation of Shijiazhuang and look at the happy life after liberation, they immediately felt emotional fluctuations when they heard that the factory was to be returned. This is inevitable."
    In response to the questions and ideological concerns raised by everyone, the factory widely explained the situation to the workers, convened mobilization meetings, and organized group discussions. It repeatedly explained the principle that temporary interests must be subordinate to long-term interests. At the same time, it also negotiated with the factory management to retain all democratic facilities and employee benefits during the state-owned period within the handover agreement.
    Therefore, the workers gradually calmed down and continued production as before. From the cleaning room to the drawing, roving, and spinning frames, all the way to the packing room, from warp and weft preparation to weaving on the machines, every production process showed the workers operating the machines skillfully and quickly, working in a tense and pleasant atmosphere. Each spinning worker still watches as many spindles as before, from 140 to 160. The workers work in three shifts, 24 hours a day, with the machines running non-stop. The belts and spindles are spinning at high speed. Within 24 hours, 12,000 to 13,000 pounds of yarn are produced here, and 400 bolts of cloth can be woven (with the required specifications unchanged). This figure is basically the same as the output before the return. The comparison of the average monthly output per unit of the industrial affairs department can be seen from the comparison of the average monthly output per unit in September before the return and November after the return. In September, each spindle produced 1.03 pounds of 20-count yarn, 1.19 pounds of 18-count yarn, and 2.56 pounds of 10-count yarn per 24 hours. In November, the average daily output was 1.05 pounds of 20-count yarn, 1.16 pounds of 18-count yarn, and 2.57 pounds of 10-count yarn. In September, each loom averaged 74.8 yards of Shannu cloth in 24 hours, and in November, the average daily output was 70.5 yards.
    From the figures, it can be seen that the yarn output has increased and decreased after the return, with extremely small differences. Although the cloth output decreased by 4.3 yards, this was due to insufficient attention to equipment in the cloth factory when the weather suddenly turned cold in November, resulting in insufficient heating and inconsistent air humidity, which affected production. After the workers repeatedly raised their opinions and improved the equipment, the cloth output increased in December.
    "Everyone is still active in production." The talks of veteran workers Li Gui and Yan Zengji, and young female workers Yuan Jiuxiang and Fei Yuemei commonly pointed out that this is because, through several months of study, everyone has figured out the principle of "labor-capital mutual benefit and development of production." Wang Zhanjin, a security guard, said: "Now we are uniting with the capitalists to develop production. As long as the capital side follows the plans during the state-owned period, there will be no problems with our workers' production."
    Mr. Lu Shaoyou, the current manager of the Dazhong Textile Mill, also said: In the past, when capitalists ran factories, it was impossible to prevent workers, no matter how hard they tried; now, with democratic discussions, there are no problems with production. Therefore, he stated that he will continue to resolutely implement all the good practices during the state-owned period in the future.
    For more than a month, the workers have proactively united the capital side, successfully carried out production, and acted in accordance with the agreement without any disputes.

    发还后的石家庄大兴纱厂
    本报驻石记者  艾方
    为了解大兴纱厂发还以后的工人生活，劳资关系，及其生产情况。记者连日访问了该厂的各生产部门、各车间，访问了工人、工会及厂方。
    大兴纱厂是石家庄规模较大的一个工厂。政府代管两年以来，全厂已经拥有一千六百七十二名具有相当文化程度及技术水准的职工。在设备方面，已有细纱机三十五台，粗纱机十五台，织布机三百二十台，并有清花、并条、摇纱、浆纱、打包等机器装置。全厂已恢复至一万一千八百七十二枚纱锭。该厂的动力部有四部发电机，最高可发电一千五百基罗瓦特。煤是从井陉运来，由一条铁路支道引到厂内直接卸车。甫告全线通车的京汉路，以及石德、正太两路的来往车辆，穿梭般地驰过它的身旁。这些有利条件，给大兴纱厂开辟了广宽的发展前途。
    就在该厂生产迅速向前发展，全国各地欢呼人民解放战争全面胜利的时候，两年来杳无踪影的大兴纱厂资方，归来申请发还私营。经政府调查属实，当即毅然决定发还，并于八月间由政府代表——原国营期间该厂厂长霍然同志，及资方代表陶稚农先生开始进行协商，办理一切手续。至十一月九日，该厂遂正式发还给汉口大兴股份有限公司。
    两年来，为了使大兴纱厂迅速恢复和发展生产，政府和工人们是作了很多的努力。当石市解放初期，敌人的飞机一连轰炸了七天，厂内机器横飞，房屋倒塌。政府为发展生产，解除工人面临着的失业危险，随即进行大量投资，派遣得力干部组织领导工人进行恢复建设。仅修建、增添设备一项，两年来政府投资即达五百多万斤小米。在工人们积极努力下，生产量日有提高，现已超过解放前生产水平。工人们努力发展生产的结果，工人的生活也逐步改善了。厂内树立起各种民主制度。大兴纱厂完全改变旧观。
    这许多铁的事实，充分有力地说明了政府是大力发展生产，并坚决执行了保护民族工商业的政策。
    发还，这在大兴纱厂确实是一个很大的变化。这样一个变化，在工人当中，在各方面，曾引起一些什么反应呢？该厂工会主任王耀林同志以肯定的口气回答记者说：“石家庄解放以后，大兴是国营，现在转为私营了，这在工厂性质上来说，已经起了一个基本的变化。因此在厂方和工人的关系上也就由过去的公私关系变为劳资关系了。工人们说：从前生产给国家，是为了支援前线；现在资本家来搞生产，是为了他赚钱。工人们想起石市解放前的痛苦日子，再看看解放后的幸福生活，因此听说厂子要发还，情绪上立刻就起了波动。这是必然的。”
    针对着大家所提出的问题和思想顾虑，该厂在工人中广泛地进行了解释，召开了动员大会，组织了小组讨论会。反复说明暂时利益要服从长远利益的道理。同时并和厂方协商，将国营期间的一切民主设施及职工福利保留在接交协定之内。
    因此，工人们逐步安心了，像从前一样地进行着生产。从清花间走到并条、粗纱、细纱，一直到打包间，从制经、制纬一直到上机织布，所看到的每一个生产过程，工人们都是那样熟练而迅速地操纵着机器。在紧张愉快地工作着。每一个细纱车的工人，过去看一百四十枚到一百六十枚纱锭，现在仍然是看那么多。工人们分做三班工作，昼夜二十四小时，人歇机器不歇。皮带纱锭在飞速地转动着。在二十四小时内，从这里生产出细纱一万二千磅至一万三千磅，并能织布四百匹（其要求的规格，没有变动）。这个数字和发还前的产量基本上是相同的。从工务部每月单位平均产量的统计，可以看出发还前的九月与发还后的十一月单位平均产量的比较。九月份每一枚锭子每二十四小时产二十支纱一点零三磅，十八支纱一点一九磅，十支纱二点五六磅。十一月份平均日产二十支纱一点零五磅，十八支纱一点一六磅，十支纱二点五七磅。九月份每台织布机二十四小时平均织山鹿布七十四点八码，十一月平均日产量为七十点五码。
    从数字上可以看出，细纱产量发还后有升有降，差额极微。布的产量虽降低四点三码，但是由于十一月气候骤冷时，布厂对设备注意不够，致使暖气不足，空气干湿程度不调和而影响了生产。经工人再三提出意见，改善设备后，布的产量在十二月份已上升。
    “在生产上大家仍然是积极的。”老工人李贵、阎增计，青年女工袁九香、费月梅等的谈话共同指出，这是由于几个月来的学习，大家已经想通了这个道理：“劳资两利发展生产”。保全工王占锦说：“现在是团结资本家来发展生产。只要资方按着国营期间的计划走，我们工人生产没有一点问题。”
    大兴纱厂现任经理卢绍猷先生也说：过去资本家办厂，防备工人，防不胜防；现在民主讨论，生产上一切不成问题。因之他表示：今后要继续坚决执行国营期间的一切好办法。
    一个多月以来，工人们主动地团结了资方，胜利地进行了生产，一切按照协定办事，没有发生过争议。
