    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 17th. A vigorous subscription campaign for public bonds is underway throughout the Northwest. Employees of the privately-owned Dahua Textile Factory in Xi'an have already purchased 1,100 shares of public bonds. In Xi'an, cadres under the supply system in various levels of government agencies have used one to three or four months' worth of allowances to purchase public bonds. Some have used their surplus from food allowances or money saved by switching from small or medium canteens to the large canteen to subscribe to public bonds. Police officers in the Xi'an public security system purchased 2,200 shares. More than 60 students from Northwest University went to various cinemas and theaters on the 6th to conduct propaganda, urging industrialists, businessmen, and well-to-do households to display their patriotic enthusiasm and actively subscribe to public bonds. The total amount of public bonds purchased by faculty and students of the school has reached 4,658 shares. Wang Dunying, a professor in the Russian Department, has a family of six to support on his salary, and his wife is also ill, but he still made the greatest effort to save part of his salary to purchase 50 shares. Xi'an Municipal No. 1 Middle School, Municipal No. 2 Middle School, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region No. 1 Middle School, and Border Region No. 2 Middle School have also launched a widespread wave of public bond purchases, led by their faculty and staff. The Border Region Women's Middle School, the Private Southeast Middle School, and the Xi'an Sports Association have been holding plays, ball game competitions, and Chinese martial arts performances for charity sales for days to promote public bonds. Students of the Fifth Division of Northwest Revolutionary University saved money from three months' worth of vegetable funds to purchase public bonds. Students of the First Division of the Northwest Party School of the CPC saved their allowances, stationery and other expenses to purchase public bonds. Laboring woman Fu Guanhua, who relies on needlework to support herself and her ten-year-old daughter, also purchased three shares of public bonds. The Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League officially established a public bond promotion committee on the 7th. The Xi'an branch of the League held a forum for its members on the 8th, and members immediately subscribed to 2,240 shares on the spot. Liu Wenbo, a member of the Xi'an Public Bond Promotion Committee, personally subscribed to 20,000 shares of public bonds, while Han Wangchen and Wang Juexian each subscribed to 10,000 shares, and Dang Hanbo subscribed to 2,000 shares. Wang Juexian also stated that he would continue to subscribe in the future when he had the means.

    Workers at the Northwest Woolen Mill, the Northwest Military Automobile Repair Factory, and the ShiliDian Auto Parts Manufacturing Factory in Lanzhou have all launched subscription campaigns. The Lanzhou People's Victory Unit of Account Public Bond Promotion Committee was established on the 12th and is now actively carrying out publicity and purchase promotion work. According to incomplete statistics, the personnel of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CPC, the Preparatory Committee of the Lanzhou Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Preparatory Committee of the Lanzhou Literary and Art Workers Association, and the Minsheng Amateur Theater have subscribed to 1,500 shares. From the 5th to the 13th, government agencies, schools, and citizens directly purchased 1,099 shares from the bank.

    The Baoji Municipal Chamber of Commerce established a Municipal Chamber of Commerce Public Bond Promotion Committee on the 11th, deciding to mobilize merchants and residents throughout the city to actively subscribe to public bonds. Muslim groups decided to mobilize wealthy Muslim households to actively subscribe.

    All cadres of the Shaanbei Administrative Office of the Public Security Bureau in Yan'an are willing to use one month's salary to subscribe to public bonds. The 257 soldiers and students of the security battalion and training class under the jurisdiction of the office, and the 30 cadres above the platoon level of the battalion, used their December salaries last year to subscribe to public bonds.

    Yinchuan City, Ningxia, held a symposium on public bond promotion issues on the 10th, deciding to establish the Yinchuan City Public Bond Promotion Committee, and elected Li Jinglin as its director. He said at the meeting: Of the 100 million shares issued in the first phase, Ningxia only accounts for 60,000 shares, worth about 8 to 9 million yuan in Renminbi, while the State Council has allocated 5 million jin of millet to Ningxia for water conservancy construction this year. This shows that the more actively people subscribe to public bonds, the greater the power the state has for construction, and the faster the construction and prosperity of the new Ningxia will be. He called on wealthy households, wealthy retired civil and military officials, and business circles in Yinchuan City to actively subscribe to help the government jointly overcome financial difficulties.
