[The following is reported by the Northeast Daily News] The Hegang Coal Mine in Northeast China, during the record-breaking campaign last November, grasped the key link to improve production, boldly broke through the old system, and implemented a major reform in production management by reducing headings, concentrating machinery, and rationally organizing labor. This reform greatly reduced the waste of manpower and materials, gave full play to the efficiency of machinery, and achieved unified management and leadership; thereby creating favorable conditions for further planned production this year. During the enemy and puppet rule, due to the predatory exploitation of the enemy and puppets, temporary small inclined shafts were everywhere. When we took over, the entire mine had 35 inclined shaft entrances and more than 500 headings, which caused serious difficulties in mining, transportation, machinery operation, labor use, and production management, and resulted in huge waste. In order to completely change this unreasonable production management, the mine leadership decided to break through this old production management method and make a major reform in June last year. After half a year of preparation, in November last year, in conjunction with the launch of the new record-breaking campaign, the concentrated management and use of headings, machinery, and labor were completed with a spirit of assault.

In the process of concentrating the headings, all security personnel completed the sealing work of the headings that were shut down this time in only seven days. The headings of the entire mine were concentrated, reducing them by more than half. At the same time, the trade union and the administration, in cooperation with the new record-breaking team, launched a quota setting education among the workers and reorganized the labor organization. Because the method of democratic discussion, unblocking of ideas, voluntary combination, and approval by the management committee was adopted in the quota setting process, the labor organization combined democratically and voluntarily made the workers feel very satisfied, and the attendance rate and labor efficiency generally improved. In the concentration and re-allocation of machinery, most units obeyed the transfer. For example, Xingshan No. 3 Mine automatically handed over the electric drills and 30-horsepower carding machines that the mine did not know about but they had kept for a long time at the meeting, so that the completion of the mechanical equipment in the pit and mutual adjustment was quickly completed.

After this major reform, the following achievements have been made:

(1) Mechanical equipment has been concentrated and used, which has exerted its efficiency and improved production efficiency. For example, for electric drills in the entire mine, in the past, an average of three headings used one unit. The drills could not drill holes at the same time during working hours. One had to be finished before another could be drilled. This not only wasted time but also made it difficult to improve the workers' drilling skills, which reduced mining efficiency. After the concentration, each heading has an average of one drilling tool, and the workers can start working after entering the pit. In the past, only one round of blasting could be done per shift, with three or four blasts per round. Now, two rounds of blasting can be done, with five or six blasts per round. The tunneling efficiency has increased from more than one meter per round shift in the past to more than five meters, which is equal to four times the original. If the medicine pot type grooving drill is fully promoted, it can reach eight to nine meters.

(2) The transportation system in the pit has been simplified, and the transportation efficiency has been improved. For example, before the concentration of Nanshan pits and troughs, 23 headings required four outlets for coal, and each outlet, regardless of the amount of coal, needed to occupy transportation time; after the concentration, 11 headings only needed two outlets for coal, saving transportation time. In terms of coal car occupancy, the stay of 48 coal cars per shift can be reduced, and accidents can also be reduced. As a result, the 150-horsepower winch, which used to be difficult to pull 250 tons per shift, can now pull more than 500 tons. The transportation capacity has been increased by 100%.

	Transportation Capacity Doubled, Airflow Sufficient, Casualties Reduced

(3) Due to the concentration of headings and the simplification of the ventilation system, the airflow is sufficient. In the past, the headings were scattered, the ventilation system was complicated, the wind door control was difficult, and the air consumption was very large. Under the conditions of natural ventilation in Hegang, the airflow was often felt to be insufficient. Each person could generally only get one cubic meter per minute, and only individual pit entrances could have three cubic meters of wind. After the concentration, according to the inspection in early January, it is common for many pit entrances to get three to ten cubic meters of airflow per person per minute, and individual pit entrances get more than 30 cubic meters.

Secondly, security work is also easier to grasp. Because the headings are reduced, security personnel can help check and prevent accidents at any time. Deaths in December decreased by 25%, and injuries decreased by 50%.

In addition, centralized mining and improved efficiency enable coal mining and tunneling to better cooperate. After mining an area, sealing an area can avoid the danger of spontaneous combustion.

(4) The concentrated use of labor reduces labor waste. In the past, the headings were scattered, and the use of labor was also scattered, and labor efficiency was very low. After the concentration, due to the rational use of labor and the implementation of new quota standards, although more than 800 people were laid off, the original output was still maintained. And personal efficiency has been improved. The average was 1.76 tons per person before the quota setting, and it rose to 2.2 tons after the quota setting.

	Material Consumption Reduced, Production Costs Reduced

(5) Material consumption is reduced and production costs are reduced. Taking the Nanshan pits and wells as an example: in the past, six level tunnels (the main coal transportation road in the pit) required 2,400 meters of rails, wires, and air pipes. After the concentration, only two level tunnels are needed now, and 1,200 meters is enough. The saving of pit wood greatly reduces the pit maintenance cost. Because the pit wood needs to be replaced once every three years, the mining and tunneling did not match in the past, the efficiency was low, the time required was long, and the maintenance cost was high. Now that the mining and tunneling efficiency has been improved, it can be mined within three years without replacement. In this way, 10 billion yuan can be saved annually in pit maintenance costs alone.

(6) It facilitates the management of administrative and technical leadership. In the past, there were headings everywhere, and it was difficult for pit entrance cadres to take care of them, and management was difficult. Now there are only nine headings in an inclined pit, and cadres and technicians go to the mine every shift to help work, constantly check, and solve problems at any time, which creates favorable conditions for the leadership.

This year, the mine plans to complete the tunneling task equivalent to last year with 60% less tunneling headings than last year; and to complete and exceed 21% of last year's production task with 21% less coal mining headings and labor after extending the working face. The overall task of reducing costs by 10% to 15% will be completed. (Xu Tiemin)

    鹤岗煤矿改进生产管理
    集中使用人力机械
    掘进效率提高四倍
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：东北鹤岗煤矿于去年十一月创新纪录运动中，抓住了提高生产的主要环节，大胆突破旧的一套，实行减少掌子，集中机械，合理组织劳力的生产管理大改革。这一改革，大大减少了人力物力的浪费，充分发挥了机械效能，做到了统一的管理与领导；从而给今年生产进一步的计划性，创造了有利条件。该矿在敌伪统治时期，由于敌伪掠夺性的开采，临时性的小斜井到处都是。当我接收时，全矿共有斜坑坑口三十五个，掌子五百多个，在采掘、搬运、机械运用、劳力使用及生产管理上造成严重困难，且浪费巨大。为彻底转变这一不合理的生产管理，该矿领导上于去年六月即决定突破这一旧的生产管理方法，作一次大的改革。经过半年的酝酿，到去年十一月间结合开展新纪录运动，以突击的精神，完成了掌子、机械、劳力的集中管理与使用。
    在集中掌子过程中，全体保安人员，仅以七天的时间，完成了此次停止作业的掌子的密闭工作。将全矿的掌子，集中起来，减少了一半以上，与此同时，工会，行政协同新纪录小组，在工人中展开定员教育，重新整编劳动组织。由于在定员过程中，采取了民主讨论，打通思想，自愿结合，管委会批准的方法，这种民主自愿结合起来的劳动组织，使工人感到非常满意，出勤率和劳动效率普遍提高。在机械集中和重新配备中，多数单位都服从了调动。如兴山三坑，将矿方不知道而他们已保存很久的电钻和三十马力的卡机，在会议上自动交出，使完成坑内机械设备及互相调剂很快完成。
    经过这次大改革之后，已取得如下成就：
    （一）机械设备获集中使用，发挥了效能，提高了生产能率。如全局电钻，过去平均三个掌子用一台，在工作时间内不能同时打眼，必须一个打完一个再打，不但浪费时间，且对工人打眼技术上也不易提高，降低了采掘效率。集中后，每个掌子平均有一台打眼工具，工人入坑后，即可开始工作。过去每一班只能放一遍炮，每遍放三、四个，现在能放两遍炮，每遍可放五、六个。掘进效率则由过去每圆班前进一米多提高到五米多，等于原来的四倍。若药壶式掏槽钎子全部推广后，则可达八至九米。
    （二）简化了坑内运搬系统，提高了运搬能率。如南山各坑槽，集中前，二十三个掌子需由四个片口出煤，每片口不论煤量多少，都需占用搬运时间；集中后十一个掌子只需两个片口出煤，节省了运搬时间，在炭车占用上，每小班可减少四十八台炭车的停留，而且减少了事故。结果使过去每小班拉二百五十吨还感困难的一百五十马力卷扬机，现在已能拉到五百多吨。提高了运搬能力百分之百。
            搬运能力提高一倍  风量充足伤亡减少
    （三）由于掌子集中，通风系统的简单化，使风量充足。过去掌子分散，通风系统复杂，风门管制困难，消耗风量很大，在鹤岗以自然通风为主的条件下，时常感觉风量不足。每人每分钟一般只能得一立方米，能有三立米风者仅个别坑口。集中后据一月初的检查，许多坑口每人每分钟得三至十立米风量者是普遍的，个别坑口得到三十立米以上。
    其次在保安工作上，也较易掌握了。因为掌子减少，保安人员可随时帮助检查防止事故，十二月份死亡减少百分之二十五，受伤减少百分之五十。
    此外，集中采掘，提高效率，使采煤掘进能更好配合，采完一个区，闭密一个区，可以免去自然发火的危险。
    （四）劳动力集中使用，减少了劳力浪费。过去掌子分散，劳动力使用也分散，劳动效能很低。集中后，由于劳力的合理使用，和执行了新的定额标准，虽然编余了八百多人，但仍保持了原有产量。而个人能率却提高了。定员前每人平均一·七六吨，定员后则上升为二·二吨。
            材料消耗减少生产成本降低
    （五）材料消耗减少，生产成本降低。以南山各坑井为例：过去六个平巷（坑内主要运煤道）需两千四百米铁轨、电线、风管，经集中后现在只两个平巷，有一千二百米就够了。坑木的节约大大减少了坑道维持费。因三年需更换一次坑木，过去采掘配合不上，效率低，需时长，维持费大，现在采掘效率提高，三年内即可采完，无需更换。这样每年仅在坑道维持费上即可节省一百亿元。
    （六）便利了行政、技术领导的管理。过去到处是掌子，坑口干部很难照顾，管理困难。现在一个斜坑只有九个掌子，每班都有干部、技术人员到矿坑帮助工作，不断检查，随时解决问题，给领导上造成了有利条件。
    该矿今年准备在集中基础上，以少于去年百分之六十的掘进掌子，完成相等于去年的掘进任务；以少于百分之二十一的延长工作面后的采煤掌子与人工，完成与超过去年百分之二十一的生产任务。总的完成降低成本百分之十至十五的任务。（许铁民）
