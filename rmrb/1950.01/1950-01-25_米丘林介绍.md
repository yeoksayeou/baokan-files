            I. Michurin's Brief History

    Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin, the great Soviet biologist, was born in 1855 and died in 1935. He began his outstanding experimental research work in 1875.

    Tracing back to his great-grandfather, he was a well-known horticulturist. Even now, in the Kaluga Province of the Soviet Union, there are still several pear varieties known as "Michurin Pears." His grandfather also ran a large orchard in Ryazan Province. His father also had a great interest in gardening. Therefore, Michurin believed that he had developed a deep interest in gardening from an early age.

    After graduating from elementary school, he dropped out of school due to poverty. He had to take a position in a railway company, with meager pay that was barely enough to maintain the minimum standard of living. Even in such difficult circumstances, he saved a portion of his salary to rent a deserted small orchard for his experimental research.

    At the same time, he visited various orchards in central Russia, where he saw that the quality of fruit trees was very poor. He then decided to eliminate this serious shortcoming from Russian soil.

    During the Tsarist era, he repeatedly requested a small piece of land from the government, or at least the establishment of a primary horticultural school, for his experimental research. However, he received only contempt and indifference, even ridicule and mockery. The monks also threatened him: "Don't turn God's garden into a brothel!" Under the Tsarist system, all lively and progressive sciences were suppressed.

    It was then, from 1911 to 1913, that the US Department of Agriculture frequently beckoned him, "Immigrate to the United States. We will give you money and equipment, or at least buy those cultivated hybrids from you at a high price." Although in such a dim and suffocating atmosphere under the reactionary Tsarist system, Michurin never wavered in his will and was not employed by imperialism. He refused all those temptations and continued to bury himself in the work of transforming nature on the thorny road.

    After the October Revolution, the first to notice Michurin's work was the immortal leader of mankind, Lenin. In 1922, Lenin sent him a telegram saying: "Your experiments in obtaining new plants are of great national significance."

    On September 20, 1934, the 60th anniversary of Michurin's career, the great revolutionary teacher Stalin congratulated Michurin with "creative work is beneficial to the motherland" and wished him "new success in transforming fruit tree horticulture."

    Due to the concern and support of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Soviet government for his work, Michurin's biological science has developed on an unprecedented scale.

            II. Three Stages of Michurin's Work

    On his scientific path, Michurin overcame countless difficulties with perseverance and finally created a brilliant prospect in the cause of mankind's conquest of nature.

    Michurin divided his career into the following three stages:

    1. Domestication Stage - In the first ten years of his research, he encountered many failures because he followed the theory of the Moscow horticultural scholar Grell, who believed that in order to improve the quality and increase the varieties of fruit trees in central Russia, the scions of southern varieties must be grafted onto the rootstocks of hardy varieties, that is, grafted onto wild or local varieties of fruit trees, and become hardy new varieties under the influence of the rootstock to a certain extent. But this fantasy proved useless after hundreds of experiments by Michurin.

    Michurin summarized the failed experiences of this stage, criticized and analyzed them, and then established a research plan for the second stage.

    2. Mass Selection Stage - In this stage, in order to obtain hardy new varieties, Michurin carried out selection from the seedlings produced by local and southern fruit tree seeds. However, with this method, good new varieties may be encountered in the first generation, but this is accidental. Usually, it must go through a long process of multiple selections to obtain new varieties.

    In this stage, although Michurin had achieved some practical success, he did not achieve his ideal. After countless repeated experiments and research, seeking to shorten the process of improving plant quality, he entered a higher stage.

    3. Hybrid Breeding Stage - This was the final ten years of Michurin's work. In this stage, Michurin created a method of changing the nature of plants, that is, using the method of cultivating hybrid seedlings to control plant development.

    Regarding this stage, Michurin said: "I selected pairs of parents from excellent local varieties for artificial hybridization, but the hybrids obtained were still not up to the desired standard. Later, I hybridized local varieties with southern varieties. Although the fruits of the varieties obtained were more delicious, most of them could not be stored overwinter... Finally, I explored an absolutely correct method, which is to hybridize the species and races of plants from distant origins (note)... As a result of such hybridization, southern fruit trees passed on fragrance, size, and color to their offspring; at the same time, frost-resistant wild species contributed their cold resistance..."

    Michurin also discovered that the development of fruit tree seedlings is governed by cultivation conditions. If these conditions are close to those that can realize the best maternal properties, then the nature of the hybrid will be dominated by the maternal properties; conversely, if it is close to the paternal properties, it will tend to the paternal properties. Michurin's law of controlling plant properties not only has great practical significance, but also fundamentally overturned the outdated theory that genetic properties are immutable and not controlled by the environment.

            III. Michurin's Achievements

    At the time of the October Revolution in 1917, there were already about 800 basic varieties of plants in Michurin's nursery. These varieties came from the United States, as well as Canada, Japan, Korea, China (including Northeast and Tibet), India, Pamir, Indonesia, Central Asia, the Caucasus, Crimea, the Balkans, the Alps, France, England, and other places.

    In 1919, he cultivated as many as 153 kinds of fruits, small fruits, industrial crops, and melons. Finally, in 1935, the new varieties he cultivated exceeded 300.

    We know that Michurin not only extended the growth limits of southern fruit trees, berries, and other plants by a thousand kilometers to the north, but more importantly, he laid a solid foundation for dialectical materialist biological science. From then on, mankind can control the animal and plant kingdom according to its own will to achieve boundless happiness.

    Lysenko, the successor to Michurin's cause, is today advancing along the great road of Michurin's biological science, endlessly.

    Note: That is, hybridize plants from afar with local wild species.

    米丘林介绍
    祖德明  戴松恩  叶笃庄
            一、米丘林简史
    苏联伟大生物科学家伊万·乌拉吉米洛维奇·米丘林，生于一八五五年，卒于一九三五年；从一八七五年起即开始他杰出的实验研究工作。
    远溯他的曾祖即是一个知名的园艺家，直到现在，在苏联卡鲁加省还有几个梨的品种，被称为“米丘林梨”。他的祖父在雷雅赞省也曾经营过一个很大的果园。他的父亲对于园艺亦极爱好。因此米丘林认为他从小即对园艺发生了深厚的兴趣。
    小学毕业以后，由于贫困而失学；于是不得不在一家铁路公司迁就了一个职位，待遇菲薄，几乎不够维持最低限度的生活。纵使在这样困难的情况下，他还节省了一部分薪给，租下一个荒废的小果园，从事他的实验研究。
    同时他参观了中部俄罗斯的各个果园，在那里他看到果树品质非常低劣，当时即下决心，一定要把这一严重的缺点从俄罗斯的土地上消除掉。
    在沙皇时代，他曾屡次向政府要求一小块土地，至少是设立一所初级园艺学校，以供他的实验研究；但是所得到的却是轻视和冷淡，甚至侮蔑和嘲笑。僧侣们也曾恐吓过他：“不要把上帝的花园变成妓院！”在沙皇制度下，一切有生气的、进步的科学都被压抑得不能抬头。
    就在那时，一九一一——一九一三年，美国农业部频繁地向他招手，“移民到美国来吧，我们给你金钱和设备，至少也要把那些育成的杂种高价地卖给我们。”虽然在反动沙皇制度下的那样暗淡而窒息的气氛中，米丘林从未动摇过他的意志，而被帝国主义所役使。他拒绝了那一切的诱惑，继续在满布着荆棘的道路上，埋首于改造大自然的工作。
    十月革命后，第一个注意到米丘林工作的，便是人类不朽的领袖列宁。一九二二年列宁拍给他一个电报说：“你在获得新植物的实验上，是具有莫大的全国意义的。”
    一九三四年九月二十日，米丘林创业六十周年纪念日，伟大的革命导师斯大林以“创造工作有利于祖国”，并愿他“在改造果树园艺事业上有新的成功”来祝贺米丘林。
    由于联共（布）党和苏联政府对他工作的关怀和支持，米丘林生物科学已以空前的规模发展起来了。
            二、米丘林工作的三个阶段
    米丘林在他的科学道路上，以坚忍不拔的精神，克服了无数的困难，终于在人类征服自然的事业上，创造了一个光辉的远景。
    米丘林把自己的事业分作如下三个阶段：
    １、驯化阶段——他在最初十年的研究工作里，曾遭遇到多次的失败，因为那时他追随了莫斯科园艺学者葛烈尔（Grell）的学说，葛烈尔认为若要改进中部俄罗斯的果树品质并增加其种类，必须把南方品种的接穗接在耐寒品种的砧木上，就是说接在野生品种或当地品种的果树上，在砧木一定程度影响之下，变成耐寒的新品种。但这一幻想经过米丘林数百次的试验，证明是无用的了。
    米丘林总结了这一阶段的失败经验，并加以批判和分析，进而树立了第二阶段的研究计划。
    ２、大量选种阶段——在这一阶段中，米丘林为了获得耐寒的新品种，曾经从当地和南方果树种子所产生的幼苗中进行选种，但是用这种方法，可能在第一代就遇到好的新品种，不过这是偶然的事，普通必须经过漫长的多次选择的过程，才能得到新品种。
    在这一阶段中，米丘林虽已获得了某些实际上的成功，但并未达到他的理想，经过无数次的反复实验研究，寻求缩短改进植物品质的过程，于是进入了更高的阶段。
    ３、杂交育种阶段——这是米丘林最后十年的工作阶段。在这一阶段中，米丘林创造了改变植物本性的方法，就是用培育杂种幼苗的方法去支配植物的发育。
    关于这一阶段，米丘林曾说：“我从优良的本地品种中选出一对一对的亲本，进行人工杂交，但是由此所得到的杂种依然不够所希冀的标准。其后，我以本地品种与南方品种杂交，由此所得到的品种的果实，虽然比较味美，但大多不能贮藏过冬……最后我探索到一个绝对正确的方法，就是用远距离原产地的植物的种与族进行杂交（注），……这样杂交的结果，南方果树把香味、大小、和色泽等传给了它们的后代；同时抗霜力强的野生种贡献了它们的耐寒力……。”
    米丘林同时发现了果树幼苗的发育乃是受培育条件支配的。如果这些条件接近于能够实现最好的母本性质的话，那么杂种的性质将以母本性质为主；相反地，要接近父本的话，它将趋向于父本性质的那一方面。米丘林这一支配植物性质的法则，不但具有很大的实际意义，而且在理论上把认为遗传性质是不变的、和不受环境支配的陈腐学说，基本上推翻了。
            三、米丘林的成就
    在一九一七年十月革命的时候，米丘林苗圃里已有约八百种植物的基本品种了，这些品种来自美国，以及加拿大、日本、朝鲜、中国（包括东北及西藏）印度、帕米尔、印度尼西亚、中亚细亚、高加索、克里米亚、巴尔干、阿尔卑斯、法国、英国等地。
    一九一九年他育成的果类、小果类、工艺作物、和瓜类已达一五三种之多，最后，在一九三五年，他育成的新品种已超过三百个了。
    我们知道，米丘林不但把南方果树、浆果及其他植物的生长界限向北扩展了一千公里，更重要的是他为辩证唯物论的生物科学奠定了一个坚强的基础。从此，人类能够按照自己的意志，去支配动植物界，以达幸福无疆的境地。
    米丘林事业的继承者李森科，今天正沿着米丘林生物科学的大路，永无止境地前进着。
    注：即用远方来的植物与本地野生种进行杂交。
