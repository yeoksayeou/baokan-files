	Zhizhuang Village in Beijing Suburbs Engages in Production for Self-Relief: Farmers Boil Saltpeter to Overcome Famine
	[Beijing News] Farmers in Zhizhuang Village, Fourteenth District of Beijing Suburbs, responded to the government's call for production for self-relief and spontaneously organized to boil saltpeter to overcome the famine. Zhizhuang Village is an administrative village with a total of 221 households. The village has very poor soil, mostly low-lying alkaline land. Coupled with this year's floods and crop failure, the disaster situation is extremely serious. Local farmers have mostly been eating grass seeds to survive this winter. Because the village is low-lying and alkaline, boiling saltpeter is relatively convenient. Local farmers responded to the government's call for production for self-relief and development of sideline occupations to solve livelihood problems, and spontaneously organized to boil saltpeter. In the beginning, each person could sweep about three loads of saltpeter soil per day, which could be used to boil 110 catties of saltpeter, which could be exchanged for 2.5 dou of corn. For a family of five, calculated at two catties of corn per person per day, this could sustain them for three and a half days. After the heavy snow, because the weather was cold and the ground was frozen, the saltpeter soil became damp, and the situation of sweeping saltpeter was not as good as before. However, now each person can still sweep half a load of saltpeter soil per day, which can be exchanged for five catties of corn. Currently, out of the 221 households in the village, 97 households have joined the saltpeter boiling group, with 153 people regularly sweeping saltpeter. In this way, not only has production been developed, but also the livelihood problems of 457 people have been solved, and a foundation has been laid for the spring life next year. In order to prevent farmers from being affected by price fluctuations, the government has specially established supply and marketing cooperatives to exchange the saltpeter produced by farmers for goods in kind, which makes the farmers feel very satisfied. Furthermore, the government has now made a plan to open up canals and smooth the water flow in the spring. The canal opening work will be carried out on the basis of the saltpeter boiling group in the form of work relief. This will not only solve the livelihood problems of some farmers in the disaster area next spring, but also help the development of production.

    京郊志远庄生产自救
    农民熬硝渡荒
    【北京讯】京郊十四区志远庄农民响应政府生产自救号召，自动组织熬硝，克服了灾荒。志远庄为一行政村，共有二百二十一户。该村地质很坏，大部都是洼地碱地，加上今年天涝不收，灾情非常严重。当地农民今冬多以吃草籽为生。由于该村地洼多碱，熬硝比较方便，当地农民响应政府生产自救、发展副业以解决生活问题的号召，自动组织熬硝。刚开始时，每人每天约能扫三挑硝土，可熬硝一百一十斤，能换二斗五升玉米，如五口之家，每人每天以二斤玉米计算，可维持三天半的生活。大雪以后，因天冷地冻，硝土上潮，扫硝情形已不如前，但现在每人每天还能扫半挑硝土，能换玉米五斤。现在全村二百二十一户，已有九十七户参加了熬硝组，经常有一百五十三人扫硝。这样，不但发展了生产，而且解决了四百五十七人的生活问题，并为明年开春的生活打下基础。政府为使农民不受物价波动影响，特别成立了供销合作社，用实物换农民生产的硝，农民都感觉很满意。又政府现已作出明春开渠顺水的计划。以熬硝组为基础，用以工代赈方式来进行开渠工作。这样不但可能解决一部灾区农民明春生活问题，并有助于生产的发展。
