Title: The Cause of the British Crisis - Surrender to Wall Street

The main reason why Britain faces serious economic problems today is the burden of financing the "Cold War." Since the end of World War II, the "Labour" government has spent 811 million pounds, or 3,244 million US dollars, to maintain British armed forces overseas.

This is more than half of the total amount of loans and grants Britain received from the United States and Canada during the war. A very large part of this amount was spent in the United States, thus causing the depletion of British dollars. Of course, all this had to be at the expense of useful production, reducing Britain's national wealth. This useful production should have been able to raise Britain's living standards and strengthen Britain's position in world trade.

The British government should bear a serious responsibility for this policy. Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Secretary Bevin, together with British capitalists, decided on a course of action that led to the following consequences:

1. Britain is responsible for protecting its own and the United States' imperialist interests in Germany, Palestine, Austria, and the Far East.
2. Britain has become increasingly and openly fiercely anti-Soviet.
3. Britain is increasingly becoming a political appendage of the Truman regime, and on many issues, it succumbs to the economic and financial supervision of Wall Street.
4. Britain does not reach trade agreements with the Soviet Union, Poland, and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, which could supply Britain with many of its food and raw material needs in exchange for British manufactured goods. Only recently, Britain has concluded a large trade agreement with Poland and a smaller one with the Soviet Union.

In carrying out this policy, Britain came close to exhausting its dollar reserves, and Britain accepted American loans and committed itself to conditions that were very favorable to American manufacturers but unfavorable to British industry. Due to necessity, Britain violated some conditions and was forced to ask the United States to ease some of the other conditions for her.

Nevertheless, the depletion of dollars continued, and now, on the verge of bankruptcy, the British went to Washington to negotiate, believing that this would solve their problems.

The British people can rightly hold the "Labour" government responsible for this situation. But the American people should realize that the American government, directed by Wall Street's orders, is even more responsible.

The American ruling class emerged from the war as the most powerful imperialist on earth, and it used this position to force Britain into a desperate situation. American pressure, combined with the reactionary tendencies of Attlee and Bevin, has made Britain and the United States stand together in the anti-Soviet bloc. American demands have prevented Britain from establishing long-term trade agreements with Eastern Europe. Britain's 811 million pounds spent on the "Cold War" was directly used by order of Washington.

The Washington conference includes nine senior ministers, three each from the United States, Britain, and Canada.

The British delegation is seeking trade and loan concessions so that Britain can avoid bankruptcy and at the same time preserve some semblance of independence for their country and empire.

The American delegation will bargain as much as possible, mainly to give American capitalists complete control over the British Empire. Whatever easing measures they may adopt, their motivation is solely due to the intention not to make their conditions too extreme, so as not to drive Britain into closer economic and political relations with Eastern Europe.

Wall Street and the U.S. Department of Defense need the British Isles and the British Empire as strategic positions in the anti-Soviet war. For this reason, they may make slightly easier bargains. But many are betting that Wall Street's greed is insatiable and that the conference will fail completely.

    英国危机的原因
    ——向华尔街投降
    霍尔作  林海译
    英国今日面对严重经济问题的主要原因，是由于“冷战”经费的负担。自从第二次世界大战结束以来，“工党”政府为了维持英国武装部队于海外，已消耗了八亿一千一百万英镑或者是三十二亿四千四百万美元了。
    这比战时英国得自美国和加拿大的贷款和赠予总数的一半还多。这数目的非常大部分是在美国消费掉的，而因此造成了英国美元的枯竭。当然这一切不得不牺牲有用的生产，减少了英国的国家财富。这种有用的生产本该能够提高英国的生活水准和增强英国在世界贸易中的地位。
    英国政府应对这种政策负严重的责任。艾德礼首相和贝文外长，同英国资本家一道，决定了一个行动方针，导致了如下的后果：
    一、英国要负责保护其本身及美国在德国、巴勒斯坦、奥地利和远东的帝国主义利益。
    二、英国变得日益处于公开的、凶暴的反苏地位。
    三、英国与日俱增地成为杜鲁门政权的政治附庸，并在许多问题上屈服于华尔街的经济财政的监督。
    四、英国不与苏联、波兰和东欧新民主国家达成贸易协定，这些国家能够供应英国许多食物和原料的需要以换取英国的制成品。最近不久以前，英国才和波兰订立了一个大量贸易的协定，并与苏联签订数量较少的一个协定。
    在执行这种方针中，英国接近于耗尽了她的美元储备，英国接受了美国的贷款而使自己答应非常有利于美国制造商而不利于英国本国工业的条件。由于需要，英国违反了一些条件，并被迫要求美国在别的条件上对她缓和一下。
    虽然如此，美元的枯竭还是继续着，到现在差不多要破产了，英国人便到华盛顿去谈判，他们认为这是为了解决他们的问题的。
    英国人民可以正确地要“工党”政府对这个局面负责。但是美国人民应该认识到，由华尔街命令所指导的美国政府是更应该负责的。
    美国统治阶级从战争中成为地球上最强大的帝国主义者，它利用了这个地位迫使英国陷于绝境。美国的压力与艾德礼和贝文的反动倾向，使得英国和美国一同站于反苏集团。美国的要求使得英国不与东欧成立长期的贸易协定。英国在“冷战”中的八亿一千一百万镑的费用是直接由华盛顿命令使用的。
    华盛顿会议包括九个高级部长，美、英、加三国各有三人。
    英国代表团在寻求贸易与贷款的让步，以便英国能够避免破产，且同时给他们的国家和帝国保存些微的独立。
    美国代表团将尽可能地斤斤论价，主要是要使美国资本家完全统治着大英帝国。不管他们将采用什么缓和的措施，其动机亦仅是由于下述的意图，即不使其条件过于极端，以便驱使英国与东欧进入更较密切的经济的和政治的关系。
    华尔街和美国国防部需要英国三岛和大英帝国作为反苏战争中的战略阵地。为了这个原故，它们也许会讨价稍为缓和一点。但是很多人都打着赌说，华尔街的贪婪是无厌的，而且会议将完全失败。
