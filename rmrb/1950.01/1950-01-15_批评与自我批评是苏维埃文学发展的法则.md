    Criticism and Self-Criticism is the Law of Soviet Literature Development
    *Literary Gazette* Editorial Translated by Jun Qiangjie
    Lenin and Stalin's party extraordinarily respects literature and art as a method of communist education for Soviet people. The party is constantly concerned with satisfying the spiritual needs of our people, it is committed to creating a rich culture, and requires writers to unswervingly improve the ideological and artistic level of their works. Comrade Zhdanov said at the First All-Union Writers' Congress: "As engineers of human souls, that is to say, to actively fight for the culture of language and the quality of creation."

    In the historic resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on literature and art, which defined the direction of our literary development, writers were assigned the solemn task of creating sincere, highly ideological works, and artistically brilliant and valuable works that satisfy the cultural needs of Soviet people.

    In the resolution on the repertoire of theaters and methods for its improvement, the Party Central Committee instructed that some dramas in our theaters depict events in a far-fetched and false manner; and Soviet people are presented in distorted and satirical shapes; one often encounters inartistic and naive scripts: written very hastily and carelessly, uneducated, and without sufficient knowledge of literary language and the language of the people. The Party called on writers to deeply study life and be strict with their works. These resolutions, full of wise and paternal care for the education of Soviet people, have shown a huge influence in our cultural development and the improvement of the ideological and artistic quality of works. In the three years that have passed since this resolution, our literature has achieved new and significant improvements, which can be represented by the appearance of many new and valuable artistic works.

    However, even now, immature and hastily written works are still published in magazines and publications, indicating a lack of understanding of reality, and are ideologically and artistically inferior works.

    Not long ago, the just criticisms of the plays *Beketov's Fame* by Sofronov and *Fire River* by Kozhevnikov, published in the Party newspaper, were new evidence of the Party's unceasing concern for the growing cultural needs of readers. These articles have great principled significance for the development of our literature. In these articles, the serious ideological and artistic shortcomings of these two mediocre plays were analyzed in detail. These shortcomings are due to unfamiliarity with life, due to carelessness and the author's irresponsibility for the cause, due to the insincere work attitude towards artistic forms and creative language - in short, due to those reasons that were mentioned in the resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks).

    The Soviet Writers' Association, at the Party conference convened to discuss the articles in *Pravda* and *Culture and Life*, in Fadeyev's report and other writers' speeches, gave criticism to the shortcomings of many other works - these shortcomings proved that some individual writers lacked a deep understanding of life and were not strict enough with their own works. Some writers have forgotten that the reality of the subject matter itself not only does not hinder the integrity of the form, but, on the contrary, it has a particularly important relationship to the form.

    The successive instructions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the need to firmly improve ideological and artistic quality have been violated by some literati, publishers and magazine editors. They promoted the publication of inferior and low-artistic works. Certain editorial departments and some critics and writers have not completely eradicated the errors criticized in the historical resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the magazines *Zvezda* and *Leningrad*. This error is that a friendly attitude has replaced a principled attitude, which has led to tolerance of artistic weakness. As a result, some writers no longer improve, lose their sense of responsibility to the people, and no longer move forward.

    The Soviet people have put forward high demands on our writers. The quality of individual creations often cannot satisfy them. The letters from readers received by *Literary Gazette* are clear evidence of this. In their letters, readers take a strict attitude, and conduct in-depth analysis and research on the artistic quality of creations - its images, plot development, style, and language, rejoice in every new achievement of our literature, and at the same time bitterly experience the failures of some authors.

    However, the issue of improving artistic quality has not yet become the focus of attention of the writers' public opinion circle and the leadership of the Soviet Writers' Association. The editorial department of *New World* magazine lacked genuine rigor and Bolshevik principles, it forgot the interests of readers and published the mediocre plays *Beketov's Fame* and *Fire River*, while *Literary Gazette* hurriedly published an absolutely affirmative review of Kozhevnikov's play. These two plays did not receive the criticism they deserved in the Drama Theory Committee of the Soviet Writers' Association, which proves the lack of creative rigor and the spirit of self-criticism in this committee.

    The Secretariat of the Soviet Writers' Association and its creative committees and branches bear full responsibility for not fully developing sharp, principled criticism that disregards face. Failure to develop ideological, creative, artistic criticism and self-criticism, indifference to the issue of artistic quality - all this, unfortunately, has not yet been overcome in the work of the Secretariat and the creative committees.

    Literary criticism has not yet guaranteed the requirements put forward by the historical resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), it has not well helped writers to create works of high ideological and artistic level.

    Our criticism rarely studies the issue of artistic quality and the improvement of author's skills. The theoretical resources of Marxist-Leninist aesthetics, and the creative heritage of ideological and truly artistic criticism done by the great revolutionary democrats at that time, are not well mastered.

    The Literary Theory and Criticism Committee failed to mobilize the power of literary criticism to study the most important theoretical and historical issues of Soviet literature, did not develop the struggle for the improvement of writers' artistic skills, and failed to promote Bolshevik self-criticism.

    The Party has indicated more than once that the backwardness of literary criticism is one of the reasons hindering the development of Soviet literature. The Party requires literary critics and writers' public opinion to develop principled Bolshevik criticism. Give merciless criticism to all phenomena of cosmopolitan thought that are hostile to us, to the remnants of formalism and aestheticism; pay keen attention to everything new, and lovingly and strictly help the ideological and creative growth of authors and the perfection of artistic skills.

    Cultivating high strictness to the works of authors, strengthening the connection between authors and the modern era, and constantly caring about artistic skills - these are the primary tasks of the Soviet Writers' Association, its publishing agencies, and all writers' public opinion.

    Consistently and resolutely implementing all the Party's instructions on literature and art, and striving for the Bolshevik partisanship in literature - this is the most important condition for further improving the national Soviet literature.

    These high requirements can only be achieved under the conditions of the widest development of criticism and self-criticism, and genuine joint efforts in the editing and publishing work of the Soviet Writers' Association and the Writers' Associations of the fraternal republics.

    In the creative committees and branches, creative research and discussion, strict criticism of new works, and guiding the broad masses of readers to participate in the study of literary works will undoubtedly greatly promote the further achievements of our literature.

    Before our literary artists, there is such a great task: to develop and perfect Soviet literature, so that it can match the socialist system at the peak of human civilization. Soviet writers and literary workers, before the people, the Party, and the great Stalin, should do everything in their power to fulfill their responsibilities.

    批评与自我批评是苏维埃文学发展的法则
    文学报社论  君强节译
    列宁斯大林的党，异常尊重作为苏维埃人共产主义教育方法的文艺。党时刻关切着满足我们人民的精神需要，它致力于创造丰富的文化，要求作家们始终不渝地提高他们作品的思想及艺术水平。日丹诺夫同志在全苏作家第一次大会上曾说过：“作为人类灵魂的工程师，这即是说要积极地为争取语言的文化及创作的质量而奋斗。”
    在规定了我们文学发展方向的联共（布）中央委会关于文学艺术问题的历史性的决议中，给作家们制定了庄严的任务——创作真诚的高度思想性的作品，创作艺术上光辉而有价值的满足苏维埃人文化需要的作品。
    关于剧院演出剧目及其改善方法的决议中，党中央委会曾指示，我们剧院中有一些这样的戏剧：事件被描写得牵强而虚伪；而苏维埃人被表现成畸形讽刺的形状；时常遇到一些非艺术的幼稚的剧本：写得非常潦草轻率，无学识，对于文学语言与人民语言没有充分的知识。党号召作家要深刻地研究生活，对作品要严格。这些关于苏维埃人的教育充满着英明的慈父般关切的决议，在我们文化发展及提高作品思想艺术的质量方面，表现出巨大的影响。在这个决议后所经过的三年之中，我们的文学得到了新的、显著的提高，这由许多新的有价值的艺术作品的出现，即可以表示出来。
    但是到现在，杂志及出版物中，还刊有不成熟的、草率的作品，标明着对现实缺乏了解，是思想上及艺术上的劣等作品。
    不久以前，在党报上刊出的，关于索夫罗诺夫所著《别凯托夫的功名》和柯哲夫尼科夫所著《火河》两剧本的正义的批评文章，是党不停地关切读者增长着的文化需要的一个新证据。这些文章，对于我们文学的发展，有着巨大的原则性的意义。在这些文章中，详细地分析了这两个平庸的剧本思想和艺术上的严重缺点。这些缺点，是由于不熟习生活，由于轻率和作者对事业的不负责任，由于对艺术形式及创作语言的无诚意的工作态度——总之，是由于联共（布）中央委会决议中所曾谈到的那些原因。
    苏联作家协会，在讨论《真理报》及《文化与生活》报的文章时所召集的党的会议上，在法捷耶夫的报告及其他作家的讲话中，曾给与了许多其他作品的缺点以批评——这些缺点证明了某些个别作家缺乏对生活的深刻认识和对自己作品不够严苛。有一些作家，忘记了题材的现实性本身，不仅妨害不了形式的完整，而且相反地，它对形式却有着特殊重要的关系。
    联共（布）中央委会，关于必须坚定地提高思想及艺术品质的逐次的指示，被一些文学家、出版工作者及杂志编辑违反了。他们促使劣等的、艺术性低的作品发表出来。某些编辑部及一部分批评家、作家，还没有彻底铲除了在联共（布）中央委会关于《星》及《列宁格勒》两杂志历史性的决议中所批评的错误。这错误是以友爱的态度代替了原则性的态度，因而就引起了对艺术软弱性的宽容。于是一些作家不再改善，丧失了自己在人民面前的责任感，不再向前进步了。
    苏维埃人民对我们的作家，提出了高度的要求。个别创作的质量，时常不能使他们满意。《文学报》所收到的读者来函，即是这件事的显明证据。读者们在信中以严格的态度，以深刻的分析研究创作的艺术品质——它的形象、情节的发展、文体、语言，以我们文学的每个新成就而喜悦，同时也辛酸地体验着某些作者的失败。
    然而，提高艺术质量的问题，还没有成为作家舆论界和苏联作家协会领导的注意中心。《新世界》杂志的编辑部，缺乏真正的严格性及布尔塞维克的原则性，它忘记了读者的利益而刊登了平庸的剧本《别凯托夫的功名》和《火河》，而《文学报》即忽忙刊登了对柯哲夫尼可夫的剧本的绝对肯定的评论。这两个剧本，在苏联作家协会戏剧理论委员会中，也没有得到应得的批评，这证明了这个委员会中缺乏创作的严格性和自我批评的精神。
    苏联作家协会的秘书处及其创作委员会及分会，对于没有好好展开不顾颜面的尖锐的原则性的批评，负有完全的责任。不能展开思想的、创作的、艺术的批评和自我批评，对于艺术质量问题的漠不关心——这一切，可惜，在秘书处及创作委员会的工作中，到现在还没有克服。
    文学批评还不能保证联共（布）中央历史性决议所提出的那些要求，它没有很好地帮助作家创作高度思想艺术水平的作品。
    我们的批评很少研究艺术质量问题和作者技巧的完善问题。对马列主义美学的理论富源，对伟大的革命民主主义者当时所做的思想上及真正艺术的批评的创作遗产，掌握得都还不够。
    文学理论和批评委员会，未能动员文学批评的力量以从事研究最重要的苏维埃文学理论问题与历史问题，没有展开争取作家艺术技巧的完善，没有能促进布尔塞维克的自我批评。
    党不只一次地指示，文学批评的落后，是妨害苏联文学发展的原因之一。党要求文学批评者和作家的舆论展开原则性的布尔塞维克的批评。对一切和我们敌对的世界主义思想的现象，对形式主义和唯美主义的残余，都要给以无情的批评；对一切新鲜的事物须要寄与锐敏的注意，并友爱地严格地帮助作者思想创造性的增长和艺术技巧的臻于完善。
    对作者的作品高度严格性的培养，加强作者和现代的联系，时时关心艺术技巧——这是苏联作家协会及其出版机关和一切作家的舆论的首要任务。
    一贯地坚决地把党对文学和艺术的一切指示实现，争取文学中布尔塞维克的党性——这是进一步提高民族的苏联埃文学最重要的条件。
    这些高度要求，只有在最广泛地展开批评与自我批评的条件下，在苏联作家协会和兄弟共和国作家协会的编辑与出版工作中的真正共同协力下，才能实现。
    在创作委员会及分会中，创作的研究和讨论，对新作品的严格的批判，引导广大读者参加文学作品的研究，无疑的，将可大大地促进我们文学进一步的成就。
    在我们的文学艺术家面前，有着这样伟大的任务：使苏维埃文学发展并臻于完善，使它能配合这人类文明高峰的社会主义制度。苏联作家和文学工作者，在人民、党和伟大的斯大林面前，应尽一切力量，执行自己的责任。
                                          （一九四九年八月六日）
