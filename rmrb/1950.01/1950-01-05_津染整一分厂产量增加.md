    Increased Production at Tianjin Dyeing and Finishing Factory No. 1
    [Our Dispatch] Tianjin Dyeing and Finishing Factory No. 1, through workers actively learning techniques and improving production, has increased its monthly output of vulcanized alkali from over 7,100 kilograms in June to over 58,000 kilograms in November. In particular, on November 1st, the factory's reverberatory furnace broke down, requiring a work stoppage for repairs, seemingly making it impossible to complete the production task. According to past experience, repairing the furnace would take at least ten days to half a month, but under the leadership of military representative Qin Chaosheng and veteran bricklayer Liu Yu, and with the active efforts of workers like Liu Fengfu, who took turns going into the furnace at 600 degrees Celsius to rush repairs, the furnace was repaired in eight hours. This enabled the completion of the November production task on time, exceeding the plan by over 7,000 kilograms.

    津染整一分厂产量增加
    【本报讯】天津染整一分厂，经过工人积极学习技术，提高生产，该厂硫化碱的月产量，已由六月份的七千一百余公斤，增至十一月份的五万八千余公斤。特别在十一月一日，该厂的反射炉坏了，必须停工修理，眼看生产任务无法完成。按照过去的经验，修一次炉至少需要十天半月，但是经过军代表秦朝升领导老瓦工刘玉，工友刘凤福等，轮流钻进六百度高温的炉子里，积极抢修，在八小时内即把炉子修好。使十一月份的生产任务按时完成，并超过计划七千余公斤。
