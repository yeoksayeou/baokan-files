The Political Department of the Hebei Military Region issued a notice on December 12th, requiring the entire army to prepare for production. The notice stated: Party committees at all levels must earnestly discuss Chairman Mao's instructions on the army's participation in production and construction in 1950, and educate all commanders and soldiers to clearly recognize that this glorious and arduous task is of great significance for the future construction of the army and the economic, cultural, and national defense construction of the people's country. In terms of production organization, production committees at all levels should be established immediately and begin planning. Prepare to establish leading bodies for cooperatives at all levels. In terms of preparing for production operations, first, each unit should inspect and reorganize its existing institutional production according to the regulations of Chairman Mao's instructions. Any production units that do not meet the regulations should immediately stop operating and transfer to legitimate enterprises; those that meet the regulations should strengthen leadership to promote their development. Production should focus on the following aspects: 1. Agricultural production. Generally, only seek some public land and wasteland, level ditches, or plant vegetables in side plots near houses with the assistance of the government, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables for three to six months per person. To this end, fertilizer should be accumulated immediately. If conditions permit, wells can be dug for irrigation, and hemp seeds can be planted on the edges of ditches for oil. 2. Strive to raise one pig for every thirty people to solve the problem of self-sufficiency in meat for the first year's festivals. In order to solve the problem of pig feed, in addition to kitchen swill, it is advocated to grind tofu, grind rice and noodles, and use wild vegetables to supplement pig feed. The use of leftover rice to feed pigs is opposed. 3. All units can use all available horses for transportation businesses that are beneficial to social and economic development, and it is strictly forbidden to use them for transportation and sales. 4. In the future, all necessary construction of institutions and troops, except for the purchase of materials and the employment of necessary technical workers, should use the unit's spare labor force as much as possible. In order to encourage production enthusiasm, certain rewards or proportional dividends can also be given. 5. Trees should be planted as much as possible inside and outside the residences, on both sides of the roads, and in areas designated by the government to cultivate timber, which is also beneficial to scenery and hygiene. Other agricultural, handicraft, or industrial producers suitable for the local garrison can also participate in a planned and organized manner. The notice also pointed out: In the production campaign, policies and regulations should be strictly observed, and all violations of policies and regulations, speculation, and all improper production and acts that harm the interests of the masses should be opposed.
