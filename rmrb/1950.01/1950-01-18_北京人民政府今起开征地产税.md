    Beijing News: The Beijing Municipal People's Government has decided to begin collecting the 1949 Beijing Municipal Real Estate Tax starting today (the 18th). In addition to the regular tax, an additional 30% will be levied for education and sanitation. For this tax collection, millet will be converted at a rate of 800 yuan per jin. To collect the real estate tax, the Beijing Municipal People's Government issued Public Finance Decree No. 1 today, requiring all taxpayers to pay the tax at any designated collection point in the city within ten days of receiving the notice. Collections will continue as usual on Sundays. Those who fail to pay within the deadline will be penalized in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for the Collection of Real Estate Tax in Beijing." The penalties are: "A late fee of 2% will be added for those who fail to pay within ten days of the deadline, and a late fee of 5% will be added for those who fail to pay within fifteen days. Those who deliberately delay or refuse to pay will be handed over to the court for handling." The tax collection method is based on a progressive tax system, with the tax amount for one standard mu (165 jin of millet) as the starting point for progression (those approved by the government may be given appropriate reductions or exemptions from progression). The collection target is the land owner. If there is a right of superficies, the payer is the superficiary. As for the land used for growing crops within the city, agricultural tax should be levied in accordance with the Provisional Measures for Agricultural Progressive Tax. However, after investigation by the municipal government, the use of agricultural land in the urban area is complex, and most of it is scattered. In the past, land price tax was levied in the urban area. If the property is re-evaluated and agricultural tax is levied instead, there will be many difficulties. Therefore, real estate tax will still be levied this year, and agricultural tax will not be levied. The announcement issued by the municipal government today also stipulates that those households without contracts or holding blank contracts who have not completed the registration procedures, resulting in the omission of land price tax, must also voluntarily declare and pay taxes to the Finance Bureau before January 31, 1950. Past tax omissions will be leniently dealt with.

    北京人民政府今起开征地产税
    【北京讯】北京市人民政府决定自今（十八）日起开始征收京市一九四九年度地产税。征收地产税时，除正税外附征教育卫生费百分之三十。此次纳税小米统按每斤八百元折款征收。为征收地产税，京市人民政府于今日发出府财字第一号布告：要求各纳税义务人于接到通知书十日内向本市任一指定代收处缴款，星期日照常收款，逾期不缴者，按照《北京市地产税征收暂行办法》处罚。该项处罚办法是：“逾期十日不缴者，加征滞纳金百分之二，逾期十五日者，加征滞纳金百分之五，如故意抗延不缴者，交法院处理”。该税征收办法系按超额累进方法计征，以一标准亩之税额（一六五斤小米）为累进起点（其经政府审查核准者，得酌予减免累进），征收对象系向土地所有权人征收，其设有典权者，由承典人缴纳。至于本市城内种植农作物土地，本应依照农业累进税暂行办法征农业税，但经市府调查结果，城区农地使用情形复杂，大都分散经营，过去城区均征地价税，若重新评产，改征农业税，困难很多，故本年仍征地产税，不征农业税。市府今日发出的布告中并规定：凡无契或持有白契业户而未办理登记手续致漏交地价税者，亦限于一九五○年一月三十一日以前，自动向财政局申报纳税，以往漏税，从宽不究。
