Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Electric Dispatch:

    Tianjin's trade union work has achieved rapid development and significant results in the year since liberation. At present, thirteen second-level trade unions, such as textile and railway, twenty-five third-level trade unions, two hundred and eighty-one branches, and four hundred and fourteen sub-branches have been established. A total of 179,570 members have been developed, accounting for 59.85% of the city's total number of workers and staff, while members among industrial workers account for 87.3% of the total number of industrial workers. The city's industrial workers have basically been organized.

    Trade union work has played a significant role in the recovery and development of Tianjin's industry and commerce. In the early days of liberation, the Tianjin office of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions organized more than 700 cadres, cooperated with the administration, and combined with the broad masses of workers to carry out the takeover, so that the city's industry and commerce could quickly resume work and open for business. In early May of last year, the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee was established. Under the specific guidance of Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Li Lisan, the current tasks of the trade union in public and private factories were clarified. In state-owned factories, in conjunction with the administration, necessary democratic reforms were carried out on the basis of strengthening the unity of employees, the democratization of factory management was implemented, and more than 50 factory management committees were established, creating favorable conditions for carrying out the production and frugality campaign; in private factories, the policy of benefiting both labor and capital to develop production was implemented, so that labor-management disputes gradually decreased, and labor-management relations moved towards normalization. In August, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee further clarified that the focus of trade union work should be on production, and immediately launched a series of production and frugality campaigns, skill competitions, rationalization proposals, new record creation, and general inspections in state-owned factories. Up to now, the total average output of state-owned factories in the city has increased by 20% to 30% compared with the normal output during the Kuomintang rule, and the output of some factories, such as steel plants, has exceeded one to four times. In terms of frugality, the savings of various factories under the China Textile Corporation in November alone reached more than 1 billion yuan. Due to the launch of skill competitions and the creation of new records, 121 production models, such as Zhang Dean and Song Chunhua, have emerged throughout the city. Under the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and developing production, workers in some private factories voluntarily lowered their higher wage standards, and some even actively assisted the capitalists in establishing production review meetings or technical research improvement associations; at the same time, collective contracts were signed, promoting the rapid recovery and development of Tianjin's private enterprises. In the year since liberation, the number of private factories and workshops in the city has increased by more than 2,500 and more than 13,000 workers.

    In terms of cultural education, political, cultural, and technical education has been conducted for employees through various means. In the past year, in addition to those who participated in large classes, seminars, and lectures, more than 60,000 employees temporarily left production to participate in three- to five-day or one-month political study classes and spare-time cultural and political supplementary classes. In September, regular workers' spare-time schools began to be piloted, with 6,946 people participating in learning and 22 schools established. At the same time, the trade union also regularly educates employees through newspapers. The "Tianjin Workers" and "Textile Workers," "Railway Employees," and other 12 types of newspapers and periodicals published by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and wall newspapers in various factories have been widely established. A total of 210,000 copies of learning materials and literacy textbooks have been distributed throughout the city. 101 factory clubs have been established, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is also planning to build a workers' cultural club that can accommodate five to six thousand people. Since liberation, more than 7,000 employees have broadcasted literary programs, production learning experiences, and trade union work on the radio. As a result of focusing on production and closely combining propaganda and education with organizational work, the class consciousness of the workers has been greatly improved, and 30,000 employees have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.

    In terms of employee benefits, ten nurseries have been established or improved in state-owned factories. Eighteen sanatoriums and nineteen employee children's schools have been added in state-owned and private factories. Nearly 200,000 workers have participated in cooperatives and received cheap food and daily necessities. A municipal workers' hospital has also been established. The status of female workers has also been improved. 25,592 women have joined the trade union, accounting for more than 89% of the total number of female workers. Twenty-six female workers participated in the first Tianjin Municipal People's Congress. Among the management committees of various factories under the China Textile Corporation, 19 members are female workers.

    Tianjin's trade union work still has some shortcomings. The style of the trade union leaders has the shortcomings of bureaucratism, and they do not go deep into the lower levels to inspect and guide the work; in state-owned factories, the trade union has not fully coordinated with the factory administration in a planned and step-by-step manner to mobilize workers to actively produce, improve technology, and improve various systems; in some private factories, there are still phenomena such as lax labor discipline and insufficient enthusiasm for workers' production.

    十七万工人组织起来
    公营企业逐步实现民主管理  私营工厂劳资关系走向正常
    公营企业产量超过国民党统治时期正常产量百分之二十到三十
    职工三万人参加共产党
    【新华社天津电】天津市的工会工作，解放后一年来获得了迅速的发展和显著的成绩。目前已建立了纺织、铁路等十三个二级工会，二十五个三级工会，二百八十一个分会，四百一十四个支会。共发展会员十七万九千五百七十人，占全市工人与职员总数百分之五十九点八五，而产业工人中的会员则达产业工人总数的百分之八十七点三，全市产业工人已基本上组织起来。
    工会工作对津市工商业的恢复与发展起了很大的作用。解放初期，华北总工会筹委会天津办事处曾组织了七百余名干部，配合行政、结合广大工人群众，全力进行接管，使市内工商业得以迅速复工与开业。去年五月初津市总工会筹委会成立。在刘少奇、李立三同志具体指导下，明确了工会在公、私营工厂中的当前任务。公营工厂中结合行政，在加强职工团结基础上进行了必要的民主改革，贯彻了工厂管理民主化，建立了五十余个工厂管理委员会，为开展生产节约运动创造了有利条件；在私营工厂中，贯彻了劳资两利发展生产的方针，使劳资纠纷日渐减少，劳资关系走向正常。八月间，市总工会筹委会更进一步明确了工会工作应以生产为中心的方针，并即在公营工厂中一连串的开展了生产节约、献技立功、合理化建议与创造新纪录以及大检查等运动。到目前为止，全市公营工厂的总平均产量已较国民党统治时期正常产量提高百分之二十至三十，有些工厂如炼钢厂等的产量则超过一至四倍。节约方面，仅中纺各厂在十一月份节约所值即达十亿余元。由于献技立功与创造新纪录运动的开展，全市涌现了张德安、宋春化等一百二十一位生产模范。私营工厂在劳资两利发展生产的方针下有些厂的工人自动降低了较高的工资标准，有的更主动协助资方建立生产检讨会或技术研究改进会；同时，又进行了订立集体合同的工作，促进了天津市私营企业的迅速恢复和发展。解放一年来全市私营工厂、作坊增加了二千五百余户和一万三千余工人。
    在文化教育方面，曾通过各种方式向职工进行了政治、文化、技术的教育。一年来，职工中除参加上大课、座谈会、讲演会者不计外，临时脱离生产参加三、五天或一月的政治学习班、业余文化政治补习班者已达六万余人，九月间又开始试办正规工人业余学校，参加学习者达六千九百四十六人，建立学校二十二处。同时，工会并通过报纸经常对职工进行教育，市总工会出版的《天津工人》和《纺织工人》、《铁路职工》等有十二种报刊，各厂壁报则已普遍建立。全市印发的学习材料识字课本等小册子达二十一万余册。各厂俱乐部已建立一○一处，市总工会并筹建了一座可容五、六千人的工人文化俱乐部。解放以来，到电台广播了文艺节目、生产学习经验及工会工作的职工已达七千余人。由于以生产为中心，紧密结合宣教与组织工作的结果，工人群众的阶级觉悟已大大提高，光荣参加中国共产党的职工已达三万人。
    在职工福利方面，公营工厂中已建立或健全了十个托儿所。公、私营工厂中增设了十八个疗养所，十九个职工子弟学校。约近二十万工人参加了合作社，得到了廉价的食品和日用必需品供应。市立工人医院亦已建立。女工的地位也已获提高，入工会者二万五千五百九十二人，占女工总数的百分之八十九以上。有二十六名女工参加了天津市第一次各界人民代表会。中纺各厂的管理委员会中，十九名委员是女工。
    津市工会工作目前还存在着一些缺点，工会领导人员作风上有事务主义的缺点，深入下层检查，指导工作不够；在公营工厂中，工会尚未完全做到有计划有步骤地配合工厂行政方面，发动工人积极生产，改进技术及健全各种制度；在某些私营工厂中还有劳动纪律松弛、工人生产积极性不够的现象。
