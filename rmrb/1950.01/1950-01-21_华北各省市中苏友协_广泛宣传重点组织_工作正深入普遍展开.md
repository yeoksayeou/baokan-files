    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th — The work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in North China's provinces and cities has made great progress since the preparations began in August and September of last year. According to incomplete statistics from the four provinces of Chahar, Shanxi, Hebei, and Pingyuan, and the city of Tianjin, there are nearly 300,000 members. Except for Pingyuan Province, the provincial branches have been formally established, and branch associations, sub-branch associations, and directly affiliated groups have been established in the organs, organizations, factories, schools, and among the citizens of various cities, towns, and counties under their jurisdiction, and have begun to develop in rural areas. The Chahar Provincial Branch has established five branch associations in Charnan, Yanbei, Chabei, Zhangjiakou, and Datong, seventeen sub-branch associations in Hunyuan, Youyu, and other places, and fifty directly affiliated groups, with a total of more than 72,000 formal members. Taiyuan City has established 143 sub-branch associations in various organs and factories. Tianjin City has established a total of 215 branch associations, with more than 70,000 members, of which more than 50,000 are in the industrial system. The branch associations and sub-branch associations in Shanxian and Huojia in Pingyuan, and in several cities and counties in Hebei, are being actively prepared.
    In the process of development, all localities have generally adopted the policy of "extensive publicity and key organization," widely introducing the Soviet Union's great friendship and sincere assistance to the Chinese people, as well as the lives and various construction situations of the Soviet people, through movies, picture exhibitions, people's night schools, symposiums, and wall newspapers. The Soviet National Construction Picture Exhibition held in Zhangjiakou was visited by 20,000 people in five days. The Soviet Picture Exhibition held in Xinxiang attracted 80,000 visitors in three days. This kind of picture exhibition improved the masses' understanding of the Soviet Union. During the two major festivals of the October Revolution Day and the celebration of Stalin's birthday, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various places carried out various propaganda activities, studied various documents related to Sino-Soviet friendship, strengthened internationalist education, and developed the organization. The people of Chahar Province were particularly grateful for the great internationalist spirit shown by the Soviet anti-epidemic team in Chahar Province in assisting in the rapid suppression of the plague. The Chahar Provincial Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association combined this example to carry out propaganda and education on Sino-Soviet friendship, which achieved good results. At present, the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in North China is continuing to deepen and develop universally. The Chahar Provincial Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has determined to strive to universally establish Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations in all counties and districts of the province in 1950, and plans to develop membership to more than 400,000.

    华北各省市中苏友协
    广泛宣传重点组织
    工作正深入普遍展开
    【新华社北京二十日电】华北各省市的中苏友好协会工作，自去年八、九月份发起筹备以来，已有很大进展。据察哈尔、山西、河北、平原四省及天津市不完全的统计，会员已近三十万人。除平原省外，各省分会都已正式成立，并在所属各市、镇、县的机关、团体、工厂、学校及市民中建立了支会、支分会、直属小组等组织，并开始向农村发展。察省分会下已建立了察南、雁北、察北、张家口、大同等五个支会，浑源、右玉等十七个支分会，五十个直属小组，共有正式会员七万二千余人。太原市在各机关工厂中，建立了一百四十三个支分会。天津市共建立支会二百零十五个，会员七万余人，其中工业系统会员即达五万余人。平原的单县、获嘉及河北的若干市、县的支会、支分会，正积极筹建中。
    各地在发展中一般采用了广泛宣传、重点组织的方针，通过电影、图片展览、民众夜校、座谈会、出墙报等方式，广泛介绍苏联对中国人民的伟大友谊与真诚帮助以及苏联人民生活及各种建设情形。张家口举办的苏联建国图片展览会，五天内参观者达两万人。新乡举行的苏联图片展览，三天观众达八万余人。这种图片展览，提高了群众对苏联的认识。在十月革命节与庆祝斯大林寿辰两大节日，各地的中苏友协组织，都进行各式各样的宣传活动，学习有关中苏友谊的各种文件，加强了国际主义教育，并发展了组织。察哈尔省人民特别对于苏联防疫队在察省的表现的伟大的国际主义精神，协助迅速扑灭了鼠疫一事，极为感激。该省中苏友好协会分会曾结合这一实例，进行了关于中苏友好的宣传教育，收到良好效果。现华北各地中苏友好协会工作正继续深入普遍开展中，中苏友协察省分会确定在一九五○年争取在全省各县区普遍建立中苏友协组织，计划发展会员到四十万人以上。
