    "The Construction of Inland Waterway Transportation in the Soviet Union"
    Yin Jiaxing
    In the great socialist country of the Soviet Union, what is the situation regarding the construction of river transportation, the most important part of the transportation industry? A general understanding can be clearly obtained in Shaskov's "The Construction of Inland Waterway Transportation in the Soviet Union" (translated by Peng Zhongwen, published by Dazhong Bookstore). The valuable experience of the Soviet Union in this regard can be studied and learned for the construction of river transportation in New China.

    In this book, the author first explains that "the creators of scientific socialism determined that transportation is a sector of material production."

    Chapter 1 of the book explains in detail "the water resources of the Soviet Union and their utilization in the past." On the map of the Soviet Union, there are 108,000 rivers, with a total length of more than 2.5 million kilometers. No country in the world has such abundant natural rivers. Before the October Revolution, the lives of the boatmen serving on these rivers were so difficult that they could not even afford bread after working a day. All equipment was old, outdated, and unorganized. The general situation at that time was "dozens of fiercely competing joint-stock companies and hundreds of small shipowners operating entirely according to their own plans, creating a state of unsystematic and anarchic river transport economy." This was the situation of Russia's inland waterway transportation before the October Revolution. However, after the October Revolution, as socialist construction began, this situation changed. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and Lenin and Stalin, river transportation began to become a useful resource and a good tool for transporting materials. The world's first "electric ship" appeared on the Neva River. In the short years that followed, the improvement of inland rivers and the creation of various ships developed rapidly.

    Chapter 2 is a history of "the Bolshevik Party's struggle to transform river transportation." In this chapter, we see the dilapidated situation left over from the old Russia, "with industry in a state of bankruptcy, agricultural economy also very difficult, and transportation only completely broken and technically backward means of transport" (page 10 of the book). Only under the Soviet regime could it "embark on the path of peaceful economic construction." Our China's inland waterway transportation has been ravaged for many years under the aggression of imperialism and the rule and destruction of the Kuomintang reactionaries, leaving it in ruins. The Soviet Union's experience in transforming river transportation is of great help to our work in restoring and constructing river transportation. The Soviet people transformed and utilized many rivers with great labor, obtained cheap electricity, and laid a good foundation for industrial construction. In addition, the improvement of river channels satisfied the water needs of cities and the irrigation of collective farms.

    In Chapter 3, it talks about "river transportation during the Soviet Patriotic War." Due to the aggressive war waged by the Hitler bandits against the Soviet Union, it also disrupted the peaceful labor of Soviet shipping. In order to defend the motherland, the Soviet Union had to implement wartime river transport tasks. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and Stalin, Soviet river transportation played a great role in the war to defend the motherland. For example, although the enemy fired 8,000 mines and 5,000 bombs at a ferry crossing, Soviet river transport personnel overcame all difficulties in various ways and transported 10 million tons of materials to the front line.

    Chapter 4 explains "the basic tasks of river transportation in the new Five-Year Plan." Such as improving the use of the Volga River and its tributaries, accelerating the turnover of ships, improving ports and wharves (by the end of the Five-Year Plan, 75 percent of all loading and unloading work will be mechanized), extending the total length of shipping routes to 115,000 kilometers, and increasing automatic ship horsepower to 300,000 horsepower and non-automatic ships to 3 million tons. The main transportation task is to completely separate timber and oil from the difficulties of train transportation. The work of improving river channels and manufacturing ships is also written in great detail.

    In the last chapter, the author tells us that the construction of inland waterway transportation in the Soviet Union is "moving towards higher development." Many of the construction facts are great and immortal projects. In the management of river transportation, the volume of transportation has increased, and countless hydroelectric power stations have been built. Currently, Soviet scientists are studying the problems of the northern rivers, and in the future, a large amount of timber from the forest zone will be supplied to meet the needs of the national economy. Recently, a huge plan has also been drawn up for the construction of inland waterway transportation, which is to prepare to use the water resources of the Ob River and the Yenisei River to supply irrigation to Central Asia. This unfolds before us a great prospect of utilizing water resources.

    《苏联内河航运的建设》
    尹家騂
    在伟大的社会主义国家苏联，作为交通运输事业上最主要的河运建设的情况是怎样呢？在沙斯可夫作的《苏联内河航运的建设》（彭仲文译，大众书店出版）一书中，是可以清楚地得到一个概略的认识。苏联在这方面的宝贵经验，是可为新中国河运建设事业研究学习的。
    在这本书里，作者首先说明了“科学社会主义的创造者，确定运输为物质生产部门。”
    本书第一章，详细的说明了“苏联的水利资源及其在过去的利用”。在苏联的地图上，河流有十万零八千支，总长度在两百五十万公里以上，世界上任何国家都没有这样丰富的天然河流。十月革命之前，在这些河流上服务的船手们的生活是困苦到工作一天连面包都吃不上的，一切设备也是古老，陈腐，落后无组织的。那时的一般情况是“数十个相互剧烈竞争的股份公司，数百个完全依照自己计划活动的小船主，在河运经济上造成了无系统与无政府的状态。”这就是十月革命前，俄国的内河航运的情形。然而，十月革命后，社会主义国家建设一开始，就改变了这种情形，经过布尔塞维克党和列宁斯大林的领导，河运开始成为有用的资源和物资运输的良好工具，世界上第一艘“电船”出现在聂瓦河上。其后短短的几年之内，对于内河的改良和各种船只的创造，都在日新月异的发展着。
    第二章是“布尔塞维克党为改造河运的斗争”史，在这一章里，我们看到了“工业陷于破产状态，农业经济也十分窘困，运输方面也只是完全破烂与技术落后的运输工具”（该书第十页）那样的旧俄遗留下来的残破局面，惟有在苏维埃政权之下，才能得以“踏上了和平经济建设的轨道。”我们中国的内河航运多少年来在帝国主义侵略和国民党反动派的统制和摧残下，弄得破烂不堪；苏联改造河运的经验，对于我们的恢复建设河运工作是有很大的帮助的。苏联人民以巨大的劳动改造和利用了许多河流，取到廉价的电力，为工业建设打下了良好的基础。并且因改修河道满足了城市的用水和集体农场的灌溉。
    在第三章中，谈到“苏联卫国战争期间的河运”。由于希特勒匪徒对苏联进行了侵略战争，也破坏了苏联航运的和平劳动。为保卫祖国，苏联不得不实行了战时体制的河运任务。在布尔塞维克党和斯大林领导之下，苏联河运对于保卫祖国的战争起了极大的作用。例如敌人虽在一个渡口上发射了八千枚水雷和五千枚炸弹，而苏联河运人员却用种种方法战胜了一切困难，给前线上运输了一千万吨的物资。
    第四章说明了“新五年计划中河川运输的基本任务”。如改善伏尔加河及其支流的使用，加速船舶的流转，改善港埠和码头（在五年计划终了时，要将全部装卸工作百分之七十五机械化），延长航运路线总长为十一万五千公里，增加自动船舶马力到三十万马力、非自动船舶到三百万吨等。主要的运输任务是使木材和石油完全脱离火车运输的困难。而于改良河道，制造船舶等工作，也写的十分详细。
    在最后一章，作者告诉了我们苏联的内河航运建设“走向更高的发展”。有很多建设的事实是伟大的、不朽的工程。在河运管理上使运输量增加了，并且建筑了无数的水力发电站。目前，苏联的科学家们正从事研究北部河流问题，今后将使森林地带大量木材供给国民经济需要。最近，在内河航运建设上，还拟具了一个巨大的计划，这就是预备利用鄂毕河与叶尼塞河的水源，供给中央亚细亚的灌溉。使我们面前展开了利用水源的伟大远景。
