　　Literary Snippets

　　The comprehensive literary monthly "New Sprouts," edited by the Kaifeng City Federation of Literary and Art Circles in Henan Province, was published last December. Now, in order to concentrate manpower and resources to improve the province's literary work, it has been decided to rename the "New Sprouts" monthly as "Henan Literature" monthly, co-edited with the Henan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, starting from January this year. It will reflect the central tasks of Henan on the one hand, and promote and guide the province's literary activities on the other. It will be launched in early February. In addition, "Great Turnaround," a popular literary bi-monthly published by the Henan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, will be launched this month.
