The Northwest Military and Political Committee will henceforth act on behalf of the Northwest People's Government and uniformly lead the work of the people's governments of the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang.

In his opening address, Chairman Peng Dehuai pointed out that the Northwest Military and Political Committee includes representatives from all regions, ethnic groups, democratic parties, revolutionary classes, the People's Liberation Army, and patriotic democratic figures in the Northwest, making it a local ethnic democratic united government in the Northwest, and an unprecedented people's democratic dictatorship regime in the history of the Northwest. Vice-Chairman Xi Zhongxun stated in his speech that as a member of the Communist Party, he would work together with all Party members and non-Party members from all ethnic groups and sectors to deliberate and encourage each other, and serve as a loyal and diligent servant of the people of the Northwest. Vice-Chairman Zhang Zhizhong said in his speech: "We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Central People's Government and with the support of the people of the five provinces, by implementing the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in a step-by-step and planned manner, a new Northwest with developed production, prosperous economy, universal education, improved culture, and eternal unity and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups will be created."

Subsequently, various committee members delivered speeches. Burhan Shahidi, a Uygur member, after recounting the heroic struggles of the people of Xinjiang against the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, called on all ethnic groups in the Northwest to unite as closely as brothers, rally under the banner of Chairman Mao, rally around the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and strive to build a prosperous and happy new Northwest under the direct leadership of Chairman Peng and Vice-Chairmen Xi and Zhang. Xirao Gyatso, a Tibetan member, Ma Hongbin, a Hui member, and Bai Haifeng, a Mongolian member, all unanimously called on all ethnic groups to unite and help each other to jointly build a new China with friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups.
