    Jiangxi Province's Financial Work Deepens into Rural Areas
    Basic Establishment of Local Currency Market
    Unite Legitimate Merchants and Organize Native Produce Companies; and Will Strengthen County Bank Work to Support Production
    [This newspaper reports] To smoothly develop urban-rural trade, prohibit the circulation of silver dollars, and consolidate the credit of the Renminbi, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Bank and the Nanchang Special Commissioner's Office jointly formed a financial work team at the end of October last year to promote local currency in rural areas. Over the past two months, it has achieved considerable success and initially laid the foundation for opening up the local currency market. Under the unified leadership of governments at all levels and with the cooperation of finance, industry and commerce, trade, banking, taxation, and public security organs, the work team united the broad masses and legitimate industrialists and businessmen, and successively carried out extensive publicity, organization, and exchange work. It also exposed and cracked down on a small number of illegal silver dollar offenders and unscrupulous merchants, and carried out work such as connecting urban and rural materials. From October 24th to November 10th, more than 20 important towns, including Fengcheng, Gao'an, Xin'gan, Xinjian, Quangang, Qujiang, and Zhangshu, were opened as local currency markets, accounting for about one-half of the entire district. Subsequently, after the twists and turns of price fluctuations in November, the use of local currency was damaged. The work team's focus shifted to developing purchasing and sales businesses, organizing trading markets, and helping the masses solve exchange problems. A freezing policy was adopted for silver dollars, and mandatory exchange was stopped. At the beginning of December, after uniting the broad masses and legitimate merchants to combat speculative profiteers, the work shifted to concentrating idle funds and organizing transportation and sales. Through urban-rural material exchange and taxation work, farmers were ideologically freed from the shackles of silver dollars and were happy to use local currency. The road for local currency to go to the countryside gradually widened. In the past two months, 45 committees for refusing to use silver dollars have been established in various county towns, 52 branch associations in various industries, and more than 20 organizations of farmers' associations in four rural townships that prohibit the use of silver dollars. More than 10,000 silver dollars, more than ten taels of gold, and more than 1,000 catties of copper coins have been exchanged. Under the exposure of the masses, a total of 12 large silver dollar profiteers were cracked down on, more than 2,000 silver dollars were confiscated, and fines of 17.5 million yuan were imposed (the money has been handed over to the government). In Fengcheng, Gao'an, and Anyi, merchants and the people were mobilized to cooperate with public enterprises to organize three native product purchase and sales companies and one rural trade group. The Gao'an Trading Company also established agencies in Shinao, Huibu, and Wangjiazhen, purchasing native products and selling daily necessities totaling more than 1 billion yuan. Based on the above work, preliminary statistics show that in the Nanchang Special District, 65 percent of the population areas has become a complete local currency market. In more than 50 towns and cities in each county, the local currency has basically completely circulated, and silver dollars have gradually disappeared in most other areas. The Provincial People's Bank and the Nanchang Special Commissioner's Office are actively preparing to establish or strengthen banks in each county to continue to implement monetary struggle work, consolidate currency values, support local production, and prepare to issue agricultural loans next spring.

    团结正当商民组织土产公司  并将加强县行工作扶植生产
    【本报讯】江西省人民银行与南昌专署为了顺利开展城乡贸易，禁止银元流通，巩固人民币信用，于去年十月底即合组金融工作队，下乡推行本币，至年底两月来已获得相当成绩，初步打下了开拓本币市场的基础。该工作队在各级政府统一领导及财政、工商、贸易、银行、税收、公安等机关配合下，团结了广大群众和正当的工商业者，先后进行了广泛的宣传、组织、兑换，并检举和取缔了少数不法银元犯、奸商，及进行沟通城乡物资等工作。从十月二十四日到十一月十日，即开辟了丰城、高安、新淦、新建、泉港、曲江、樟树等二十多个重要城镇为本币市场，约占全分区二分之一的地区。嗣后经过十一月物价波动的曲折过程，本币使用受到损害，该队工作方向乃致力于开展购销事业，组织交易市场，帮助群众解决交换问题。对银元采冻结方针，停止强制兑换。十二月初团结了广大群众与正当商人打击了投机奸商后，将工作着重转于集中游资，组织运销。通过城乡物资交换与税收工作，使农民从思想上摆脱了银元的束缚，而喜用本币。本币下乡的道路遂逐渐开阔。两个月来，各县城镇共成立拒用银元委员会四十五个，各行各业的分会五十二个，各县城镇四乡农会禁用银元的组织约二十余处，兑换银元万余元，黄金十余两，铜元千余斤。在群众的检举下，取缔了大的银元奸商共十二家，没收银元二千余元，罚款一千七百五十万元（该款项已交政府）。在丰城、高安、安义发动商民协同公营企业组织了土产购销公司三个，农村贸易小组一个。高安贸易公司并在石脑、灰埠、王家镇三处设立了代办处，收购土产和推销日用品达十亿之多，在以上工作基础上，计初步统计，在南昌全分区占人口百分之六十五的地区已完全成为本币市场，各县城镇有五十余处本币基本上已完全流通，其他大部分地区银元亦已渐趋匿迹，现省人民银行及南昌专署已在积极准备建立或加强各县银行，继续贯彻货币斗争工作，巩固币值、扶助当地生产，并准备明春发放农业贷款。
