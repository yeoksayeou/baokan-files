    [This Newspaper News] The All-China Women's Federation held a council meeting yesterday and decided to issue a letter to all members in response to the call of the National Democratic Women's Federation to promote and subscribe to the People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds among women in all cities across the country. The letter stated: We hope that all branches of the All-China Women's Federation and all members will enthusiastically and actively promote and subscribe to public bonds. The vast majority of our members are scattered in large and medium-sized cities, so we should especially shoulder this glorious task. Whether we can complete this work is truly the best test of our strength and patriotic enthusiasm. First of all, we must study the New China News Agency's New Year's Day editorial "Complete Victory, Consolidate Victory," the State Council's "Instructions on the People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds," and the National Women's Federation's call. Under the leadership of the local Democratic Women's Federations, we must make efforts to publicize, promote, and subscribe, especially among the broad masses of housewives. And we must ensure that this movement carries out patriotic education, enhances the general women's understanding of politics, and unites more sisters.

    中国妇女联谊会号召会员努力劝销认购公债
    【本报讯】中国妇女联谊会昨日曾举行理事会，决定为响应全国民主妇联对全国各城市妇女推销认购人民胜利折实公债的号召，发表告全体会员书。内称：我们希望中国妇女联谊会各地分会和所有会员们都热烈积极地劝销、认购公债。我们的会员绝大多数散布在各大中城市，所以，也就特别应该多肩负起这一光荣的任务。能否完成这个工作，实在是我们的力量和爱国热情一个最好的考验。首先要进行对今年元旦新华社的社论《完成胜利，巩固胜利》，政务院“关于人民胜利折实公债的指示”及全国妇联的号召等文件的学习，在各地民主妇联的领导下，特别在广大的家庭妇女中间，努力进行宣传，劝销和认购。并必须作到通过这个运动进行爱国主义的教育，提高一般妇女对政治的认识，和团结起更多的姊妹。
