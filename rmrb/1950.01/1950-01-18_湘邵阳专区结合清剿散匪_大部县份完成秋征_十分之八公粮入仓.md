    [Our Newspaper's News] In Shaoyang Special District, Hunan Province, the grain requisition work in most counties has also entered the stage of clearing up remaining arrears. By the end of last December, over 80% of the grain requisition task for the entire district had been stored in the granary. The grain requisition work in Shaoyang Sub-district was carried out in conjunction with bandit suppression. In addition to the main force launching offensives, completely annihilating or defeating bandit gangs such as Chen Guangzhong and Yin Liyan, and opening up a new situation for grain requisition work, the comrades of the grain requisition work teams in various districts closely integrated with the masses, requisitioning grain during the day and suppressing bandits at night, highly promoting the revolutionary style of hard work and bravery, so that scattered bandits in the surrounding countryside surrendered or disintegrated one after another, thus laying a foundation for the successful completion of the grain requisition task. However, in some areas, due to insufficient attention to bandit suppression, or because cadres lacked confidence in completing the task ideologically, leadership was passive, and they did not properly mobilize the masses and control the Baojia (Local administrative units) and use administrative power, which caused many detours in the grain requisition work. The special district is now concentrating all its efforts on clearing up the remaining arrears. The counties have successively held joint meetings of district secretaries and heads, farmers' representative meetings, and Baojia chiefs' meetings to further clarify thinking, examine work, and appropriately adjust the cadres and public grain quotas in areas with slow work progress. At the same time, they mobilized the masses, organized grain transportation teams, and strengthened the management of warehouses. Some areas where work is nearing completion are conducting summaries of grain requisition and bandit suppression, and preparing for the next stage of work.

    湘邵阳专区结合清剿散匪
    大部县份完成秋征
    十分之八公粮入仓
    【本报讯】湖南邵阳专区征粮工作大部县份亦已经进入扫清尾欠阶段。全区征粮任务至去年十二月底已经入仓的有百分之八十强，邵阳分区征粮工作是与剿匪结合进行的。除了主力部队发动攻势，全歼或击溃陈光中、尹立言等匪部，给征粮工作打开新局面外，各区征粮工作队同志，大都紧密结合群众，日间征粮，晚上剿匪，高度发扬了艰苦勇敢的革命作风，使四乡散匪纷纷投诚或瓦解，因而给征粮工作打下了胜利完成任务的基础。但也有些地区因重视剿匪不够，或因干部思想上缺乏完成任务的信心，领导上被动，没有好好发动群众和控制保甲使用行政力量，以致征粮工作走了不少弯路。该专区现正集中全力扫清尾欠。各县已先后召开区书区长联席会议、农代会、保甲长会，进一步打通思想检查工作，适当调整工作迟缓地区的干部和各区公粮配额。同时发动群众，组织送粮队和加强仓库的保管工作，有些工作接近完成地区则进行征粮剿匪总结和作下一步工作的准备。
