North China Military Region Units Actively Participate in Production and Construction
Saving National Expenditure and Improving Troop Life

[Reported by this newspaper] The units of the People's Liberation Army's North China Military Region, in the intervals between intense training and the execution of bandit suppression tasks, are actively participating in production and construction work, saving national expenditures, improving the lives of the troops, and enhancing their political awareness and strengthening military-civilian relations through labor. In July of last year, the front committee of a certain corps instructed its subordinate units to carry out the three principles of production: First, not to engage in commercial production; second, not to compete with the people for profit; and third, to focus on improving the lives of the vast majority of troops. It also emphasized unified leadership in production and strengthened organization and discipline. In order to strengthen production leadership, in a certain division, from the division level down to the company level, administrative deputy cadres were specifically responsible for leading production work. Furthermore, in late August, a certain division convened a joint meeting of regimental commanders, deputy regimental commanders, and supply directors to formulate a production plan for the entire division.

    华北军区所属各部队积极参加生产建设
    节省国家开支部队生活改善
    【本报讯】人民解放军华北军区所属各部队，在紧张的整训与执行剿匪任务的间隙中，积极参加生产建设工作，节省了国家开支，改善了部队生活，并在劳动中提高了政治觉悟，密切了军民关系。在去年七月间，某兵团前委即指示所属部队进行生产的三项原则：一、不作商业生产；二、不得与民争利；三、以改善广大部队生活为重点。并强调生产的统一领导，加强组织性纪律性。为了加强生产领导，某师从师到连，各级都以行政干部副职专门负责领导生产工作。某师更于八月下旬召开了各团正副团长、供给主任联席会议，制定了全师生产计划。
