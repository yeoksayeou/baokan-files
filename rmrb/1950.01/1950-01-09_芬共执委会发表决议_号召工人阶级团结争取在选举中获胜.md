Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 8th. A consolidated TASS dispatch from Helsinki: The Executive Committee of the Finnish Communist Party issued a resolution on the 5th regarding the unity of the labor movement, stating: At a time when international reactionaries are preparing for a new war, the working class must unite to fight back against the warmongers. The resolution exposed the right-wing Social Democratic Party as the agent of capitalism, stating that due to the policies of the Social Democratic Party, the profits obtained by capitalists in 1948 increased by an average of 48 percent. The prices of consumer goods are constantly rising, while the real wages of workers are declining. The number of unemployed is about to reach 100,000. The resolution believes that the current urgent task of all working people is to unite around the presidential candidate of the Finnish People's Democratic League. The victory of the Finnish People's Democratic League in this election will guarantee the victorious development of Finland's peace, democracy, and economy.

    芬共执委会发表决议
    号召工人阶级团结争取在选举中获胜
    【新华社北京八日电】综合塔斯社赫尔辛基消息：芬兰共产党执行委员会于五日发表关于劳工运动团结的决议称：在目前国际反动派准备新战争的时候，工人阶级必须团结起来反击战争贩子。决议揭发右翼社会民主党是资本主义的代理人，由于社会民主党的政策，资本家在一九四八年获得的利润平均增加了百分之四十八。消费品的价格不断上升，而工人的实际薪资则下降。失业人数将要达到十万。决议认为所有劳动人民当前的紧要任务是团结在芬兰人民民主联盟的总统候选人的周围。芬兰人民民主联盟在这次选举中的胜利，将保证芬兰的和平、民主和经济的胜利发展。
