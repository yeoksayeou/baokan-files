Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 19th: According to a TASS report from Moscow, the Soviet Red Navy newspaper published a statement by Sivolap, Deputy Minister of the Soviet Food Industry, stating that the 1949 Soviet food industry production plan was completed on December 21st last year, coinciding with Stalin's 70th birthday. It produced more sugar, macaroni, sweets, rapeseed oil, artificial cheese, canned food, tea, and other products than in 1948. The achievements of the sugar industry are particularly gratifying. All sugar factories have not only been restored after the war but have also exceeded their pre-war production capacity.

Sivolap continued: Last year, the food industry over-fulfilled its plan by producing food worth 3.5 billion rubles, and gained an over-plan accumulation of 150 million rubles. Great attention was paid to the mechanization of production. Last year, 4,100 new machines and equipment, 140 automatic machines, and over 900 types of machinery to facilitate workers' labor were adopted in various enterprises of national importance. In food industry enterprises, over 12,000 work teams with 110,000 workers are engaged in a competition specializing in the production of first-class food. Three hundred and thirty-five factories have completed their five-year plans ahead of schedule (within three years). The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR conferred the lofty title of Hero of Socialist Labor on 250 advanced workers from the state farms under the Food Industry Department, and another 8,000 people were awarded medals and orders.

Sivolap concluded by pointing out that this year, the workers of the Soviet food industry will further strengthen their work to strive to fulfill Stalin's instructions: to produce abundant food in the Soviet state. This industry will continue to increase production speed, improve quality, and expand the variety of products. Many new food enterprises, including confectionery and tea factories, artificial cheese and sugar factories, will be completed this year.
