    Ways to Promote Collective Purchase of Public Bonds
    Jin Yu
            I. Organizing Experiments in Collective Purchasing

    The National Bank, which is the agent for issuing People's Victory Discount Public Bonds in the capital, stipulated collective purchase methods when it undertook this task, and achieved considerable success at the beginning of implementation. Some issuing units actively sent external staff to various enterprises, government agencies, and organizations to organize collective purchases by employees in order to promote the realization of collective purchases. According to the experience in the initial ten-day period of public bond issuance, collective purchase is proven to be a good way to issue public bonds. It can improve the efficiency of issuance work and save manpower and material resources. Sending external staff to actively organize is also an effective method to ensure collective purchases.

    During the first ten days of public bond issuance in the capital (from January 5th to 10th), although the eighteen units acting as agents for issuing public bonds universally accepted collective purchases, less than half actively sent external staff to organize them. According to incomplete statistics, these units' external staff contacted nearly six hundred units in the first ten days (mostly factories and government agencies, followed by organizations and schools). All the units contacted unanimously expressed approval of this method, and more than one hundred units such as the People's Printing Factory and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives have adopted this method, purchasing public bonds themselves or with the assistance of bank external staff in accordance with the methods set by the bank.

    During the first ten days of public bond issuance in the capital, many agent issuing units, although selling more than ten thousand bonds daily, with three to five thousand people calculated, there was no crowding in the retail outlets, and the specific procedures could be cleared on the same night. Why could this be? Naturally, it should be attributed to this purchasing method. According to existing experience, this method can first save manpower and material resources on the purchasing side. Personnel from various purchasing departments (enterprises, government agencies, organizations, etc.) can use the collective purchase method without leaving their jobs and without having to run to the agent issuing bank to achieve the purpose of purchasing. On the agent issuing bank side, in addition to avoiding crowding at retail outlets and allowing business personnel to handle procedures calmly and orderly, before the formal bond certificates are printed, collective purchases can issue a temporary receipt summarized by unit, and then exchange the receipt for formal bond certificates in the future. Otherwise, issuing a temporary receipt to each of the thousands of purchasers every day, the complexity of the procedure and the consumption of manpower and material resources is very large. In addition, some agent issuing units adopt the "flat plate bundling" method for collecting and paying public bond purchase funds with their correspondent accounts or enterprises and government agencies. In this way, the bank can also collect the funds at one time and count them at its leisure, which can also avoid the tediousness of temporary counting.

            II. Several Points for Improvement

    There are still some imperfections in the work of organizing collective purchases by agent issuing banks. These are raised for research and improvement reference.

    (1) Dispatching external staff to enterprises, government agencies, organizations, and other units to organize collective purchase methods has not yet been universally adopted by various agent issuing institutions. Some units that have adopted it have not made this work one of the focal points of external work. Therefore, the various agent issuing departments and offices of the People's Bank of China Beijing Branch should strengthen or universally establish external work to promote collective purchases.

    (2) Currently, the external staff in the various departments and offices that have established external staff are working individually without unified leadership. In order to strengthen this work, the Beijing Branch (or entrusted to the Savings Department), in addition to leading the various departments and offices, should also have single leadership for the external staff, such as establishing a joint meeting system for external staff to exchange and summarize experiences. Establish a reporting system to understand the overall situation in a timely manner and determine the focus of external work. In addition, the leading organization should promptly transmit relevant public bond issuance documents and issues (such as the State Council's instructions on the issuance of Victory Discount Public Bonds, the method of phased interest subsidies, the amount of interest for this ten-day period, the price of each public bond, the price calculation method, the preferential exchange rates for gold and foreign currency, and the capital's issuance situation, etc.) to the external staff of various departments and offices as reference for their work.

    (3) The targets of activity for the external staff of various departments and offices currently focus more on government agencies, factories, schools, organizations, and other departments. As the work progresses, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has allocated public bond quotas, and industrial and commercial sectors, local people, wealthy households, and retired officials have successively been mobilized and are actively subscribing. The external force organizing collective purchases should also be further expanded and deepened into the trade associations of various industrial and commercial sectors, district offices, and residential areas.

    (4) The external staff of various departments and offices can be allocated and used by the leading organization (branch or savings department) so that they can be used centrally when necessary. The collective purchasing units organized by the external staff of various units can be adjusted when necessary and should not be confined to purchasing within their own unit, so as not to crowd one place and hinder the issuance work.

    (5) Based on the external staff, a "Collective Purchase of Public Bonds Service Team" can also be established, with a dedicated telephone (number announced in the newspaper) in each department and office for contacting or handling collective purchase matters and answering related inquiries. This will further increase its effectiveness.

### 推广集体购买公债的方式

    推广集体购买公债的方式
    靳羽
            一、组织集体购买的实验
    首都代理发行人民胜利折实公债的国家银行，在担负这个任务后，曾规定有集体购买办法，在实行之初即获得相当的成绩。其中有若干发行单位为促使集体购买的实现，并主动出动外勤人员至各企业、机关、团体等单位里组织职工集体购买。根据公债发行初旬的经验，证明集体购买是公债发行的一种良好方式。能够提高发行工作的效率，节省人力、物力。出动外勤人员主动进行组织，又是保证集体购买的有效方法。
    在发行公债的第一旬（由一月五日至十日），首都代理发行公债的十八个单位在发行中虽普遍接受集体购买，但主动出动外勤人员来组织集体购买的还不及半数。据不完全的统计，这些单位的外勤人员在初旬共接洽了近六百个单位（其中以工厂、机关较多，其次为团体、学校）。凡是接洽过的单位，对这种方式一致表示赞同，并已有人民印制厂、供销合作总社等百余单位采用这种方式，依照银行所定办法，自行或在银行外勤人员协助下来购买公债。
    在首都发行公债的第一旬中，许多代理发行的单位，虽然每日发售公债分数逾万，以人数计算三、五千不等，但是门市并无拥挤现象，办理具体手续也能当晚结清。为什么能这样呢？自然要归功这种购买方式。根据已有的经验，这个方法第一可以节省购买方面的人力、物力。各购买部门（企业、机关、团体等）的人员，用集体购买的方式，不必离开自己的工作岗位，不必跑到代理发售的银行就可以达到购买的目的。在代理发行银行方面，除了可以免除门市拥挤，业务人员能从容按序的办理手续外，在正式债票没有印就之前，集体购买可以按单位汇总开出一张临时收据，将来再凭收据换取正式债票，否则每日千百个购买者每人开给临时收据一张，其手续繁复和人力、物力的消耗是很大的。此外，有的代理发行单位与往来户或企业、机关收付购买公债之款项采用“平版扎捆”办法，这样银行亦可以一次将款收下，抽暇再行点数，这样又可以免去临时点款的繁琐。
            二、应该改进的几点
    代理发行的银行，进行组织集体购买工作，目前尚有若干不完备之处，提出来供研究和改进的参考。
    （１）派遣外勤人员向企业、机关、团体等单位进行组织集体购买方式，目前尚未被各代理发行机构所普遍采用，已采用的单位，有的又没有把这件工作作为外勤工作的重心之一。因此，人民银行北京分行各代理发行部、处尚应加强或普遍建立外勤工作，以推广集体购买。
    （２）目前已建立外勤人员各部、处的外勤人员均系个别进行工作，尚无统一的领导。为加强这一工作，北京分行（或委托储蓄部），除对各部、处领导外，对外勤人员还应有单一的领导，如建立外勤人员联席会议制度，以交流总结经验。建立汇报制度，以便及时了解全面情况，确定外勤工作重心。此外领导机构还应将有关公债发行的文件和问题（如政务院发行胜利折实公债的指示、分期贴补利息办法、本旬贴息数额、公债每分牌价、牌价计算法、优待兑换黄金、外币的牌价以及首都发行情况等）及时传达给各部、处外勤人员作为工作的参考。
    （３）各部、处外勤人员活动对象目前多偏重机关、工厂、学校、团体等部门，随工作的开展在北京各界协商委员会分配公债数额，工商业、地方人士、殷实富户及退职官吏已相继动员起来，纷纷认购的情况下，组织集体购买的外勤力量也应进一步展开，深入到各工商业的同业公会和区公所及住宅区去。
    （４）各部、处的外勤人员可由领导机构（分行或储蓄部）调配使用，以便必要时集中使用。经过各单位外勤人员所组织的集体购买单位，必要时加以调剂，不要拘泥在本单位购买，以免拥塞一处妨碍发行工作。
    （５）以外勤人员为基础，还可以建立“集体购买公债服务组”，各部处并设专用电话一具（号码在报上公布），进行联络或办理集体购买事宜，答复有关的询问。这样将会更增加它的效能。
