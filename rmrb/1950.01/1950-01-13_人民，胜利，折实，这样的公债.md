People, Victory, Real Value - Such Public Bonds
    Huang Yanpei

The 1950 People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds were finally officially issued on January 5th amidst the extremely tense and excited mood of people everywhere, with people in various places flocking to the People's Bank to subscribe.

I have also purchased them, and I have earned the right to speak.

A cook cooking a dish first heats the pot very, very hot, and then throws the vegetables into the pot. With a "sizzle," they are cooked in no time, and taste delicious. The public bond promotion for several weeks before January 5th was heating up the pot. The masses in front of the People's Bank on the day the issuance began were toe-to-heel, keeping the tellers at the counters extremely busy. This is the "sizzle" sound in the pot being made.

Are there still people who haven't subscribed to these public bonds? Listen to me for a few words:

Everyone must purchase the People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds. There are various reasons for this, and I will analyze them:

First, after the People's Liberation Army achieved basic victory, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was convened, and the Central and all levels of People's Government were established. The People's Liberation Army belongs to the people, the CPPCC belongs to the people, the Central and all levels of government belong to the people, and so do the People's Courts, the People's University, and the People's Bank. That is to say, everything belongs to the people. Isn't this public bond labeled "People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds"? Isn't it the people's public bond? Everyone ask yourselves: Are you people of the People's Republic of China? Yes. Then, since the People's Government is issuing this People's Public Bond, and you are one of the people, shouldn't you quickly purchase it? Moreover, this sum of money is taken from the people and used for the people. Purchasing this public bond isn't for the sake of the country; it's simply for yourself.

Second, how can we forget? Victory, victory. Rather than saying the people's victory, it would be more accurate to say it was the People's Liberation Army's victory. The People's Liberation Army is about to advance to the whole country. I want to ask universally: How do you feel after contacting the People's Liberation Army? From my contact, indirect contact, and indirect and even more indirect contact, I dare to boldly say: I haven't heard one person out of a hundred express dissatisfaction with one soldier out of a hundred soldiers in the People's Liberation Army. Alas! The People's Liberation Army truly deserves our people. But have our people been worthy of the People's Liberation Army? I'll just cite one or two facts. Two months ago, I personally heard that when the southward-bound People's Liberation Army was about to advance to Guangdong, the troops had no vegetables at all, and merely dipped their chopsticks into the salt bowl a few times, then swallowed it with rice. Guangdong and its neighboring provinces have relatively abundant supplies, haven't they? The People's Liberation Army absolutely refuses to demand a single item of supplies from the common people, and absolutely refuses to accept even gifts, preferring to endure such hardship themselves. At the Fifth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, Peng Dehuai, Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, reported: "The five provinces of the Northwest have been completely liberated, and the numerically superior enemy has been completely annihilated in half a year, advancing nearly ten thousand li, and lacking shoes, socks, and cotton clothing in the freezing cold, crossing snow-capped mountains, grasslands, and the Gobi Desert. This is a great miracle in military history. Only a highly conscious people's army can do this." The People's Army truly deserves the people. Can it be that our people don't even consider the word "victory" when purchasing the public bonds that the government guarantees in principal and interest, and quickly purchase them?

Third, moreover, this kind of public bond is not only the usual guarantee of principal and interest, but also takes into account that the bondholders may be worried about the continued rise in prices, and especially provides a thorough guarantee, adopting a real value system. Buying one share of public bonds is not equal to saving some Renminbi, but is equivalent to purchasing six jin of rice, one and a half jin of flour, four chi of white fine cloth, and sixteen jin of coal. When the time comes, in case prices rise, and you can't buy these materials with these Renminbi, you can purchase the public bonds and still save Renminbi equivalent to the value of these materials, and you can immediately buy these materials. The calculation is very smooth! Very smooth!

At the sight of the two words "People," one feels one shouldn't not buy this kind of public bond. Upon seeing the two words "Victory," one even more cannot not buy it. Seeing the two words "Real Value" makes one even more unwilling not to buy it. Let me say a paragraph to explain that these public bonds are a pleasure to buy, a pleasure to buy.

If buying public bonds is for the sake of savings, then one should consider a condition: Are these public bonds stable? I dare to be responsible and answer: Stable! Stable! The issuance of the 1950 People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds is based on the 1950 National Financial Revenue and Expenditure Budget approved by the Fourth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on December 2, 1949. Within this budget, enterprise investment accounts for 23.9 percent. If you take away this enterprise investment – theoretically, enterprise investment can be taken away – then revenue and expenditure are balanced. Not only is there no deficit, but there is also a surplus. Therefore, this kind of public bond is not to make up for a deficit, but is actually a small part of enterprise investment. Enterprises seek profit from capital, so this kind of public bond can be repaid in the first year with reasonable financial utilization. What problems will there be when it is spread over five years?

Even if we buy public bonds for personal gain, we can definitely say: it is a good deal. Moreover, we are ultimately for the people, for victory, and these spirits of serving the public account for a larger proportion in terms of composition!

Conversely, I really can't find any reason to still be skeptical about this kind of public bond, or to wait and see. I have nothing to say.

Are there still people who haven't purchased these People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds? Come! Come!

    人民，胜利，折实，这样的公债
    黄炎培
    一九五○年人民胜利折实公债，终于一月五日在各地人民极紧张兴奋的情绪中正式发行了，各地人民纷纷的来向人民银行认购了。
    我也已经购到了，我取得了发言资格了。
    厨子煮菜，先把锅子煮得很热很热，然后把菜撤下锅子，“嗤”的一声，不多时，熟了，津津有味了，一月五日以前几个星期的公债宣传，是在煮热锅子，一到发行开始那天，人民银行门前群众前脚趾接着后脚跟，忙煞了柜台上的行员，这就是锅子里“嗤”“嗤”的大声在发作。
    还有人没有认购这公债么？听我说几句话：
    人民胜利折实公债每一个人必须购买，中间有种种理由存在，我来分析一下：
    第一，在人民解放军取得基本胜利之后，通过了人民政治协商会议，成立了中央和各级人民政府，解放军是人民的，政协会是人民的，中央和各级政府是人民的，还有人民法院，人民大学，人民银行，就是说一切一切是人民的。这种公债不是已经标明“人民胜利折实公债”么？还不是人民的公债么？大家问一问自己：你是不是中华人民共和国的人民？是的。那么人民政府发行这种人民公债，你既然是人民之一，还不快快购买么？而况这笔公债，取之于人民，用之于人民，购买这种公债，不是为了国家，简直是为了自己。
    第二，我们怎么可以忘掉呢？胜利胜利，与其说人民胜利，还不如说人民解放军胜利比较正确些，人民解放军快推进到全国了，我要普遍地发问：你们和解放军接触以后，感觉怎样？以我所接触，间接地接触，间接而又间接地接触，简直敢于大胆地说：我没有听到一百个人中间有一个人对于一百个解放军中间的一个解放军说感觉不满意，唉！解放军真对得起我们人民了。可是我们人民已经对得起解放军没有？我随便举一两个事实。两个月前我亲耳听到南下的解放军快要推进到广东的时候，军队里什么菜蔬都没有，仅仅把筷子向盐碗里插了几插，就拌着饭吞下去，广东和他附近省分的物资还不是比较丰富的么？解放军绝对不愿意向老百姓需索一分物资，连赠送给他们都绝对不肯受，宁使自己吃这样的苦；西北军政委员会彭德怀主席在第五次中央人民政府委员会上报告：“西北五省获得全部解放，在半年中彻底消灭了数量上占优势的敌人，进军近万里，在天寒地冻时，缺少鞋袜棉衣，越过雪山草地，戈壁沙漠，这是军事史上一大奇迹。只有高度觉悟的人民军队，才能如此。”人民军队真对得起人民了，难道我们人民连政府替你保本保息的公债还不看在胜利两个字面上，快快的购买么？
    第三，而况这种公债，不但是通常的保本保息，还体谅着持票人会顾虑到物价继续上涨，特地来一个彻底的保证，采用折实制，买一分公债，不是等于储蓄了这一些人民币，而是购定了六市斤的米，一市斤半的面粉，四市尺的白细布和十六市斤的煤炭，到相当时期，万一物价上涨，拿着这一些人民币购不到这一些物资的了，就为购了公债还得保存和这一些物资价值相等的人民币，即时可以买进这一些物资，算盘打起来，很通！很通！
    一看到人民两字，便感觉不应该不买这种公债了，次看到胜利两字，更不能不买，再看到折实两字，更不肯不买，我再说一段话，说明这公债是乐得买的，乐得买的。
    如果买公债为的是储蓄，那应该考虑一个条件，这种公债稳不稳呢？我敢负责答复：稳！稳！一九五○年人民胜利折实公债的发行，根据一九四九年十二月二日中央人民政府委员会第四次会议通过的一九五○年度全国财政收支概算，这分概算内，企业投资占百分之二十三·九，如果把这笔企业投资提开，——理论上企业投资是可以提开的，——那么收支相抵。不但没有赤字，而且还有盈余，所以这种公债，并不是弥补赤字，实际上是充企业投资的一小部分，企业是将本求利的，所以这种公债在财政的合理运用上，第一年都能够归还，何况摊到五年之久，还会有什么问题呢？
    我们购买公债，就算为了个人的私利罢，也可以肯定地说：是上算的了，而况我们到底是为了人民，为了胜利，这些为公众服务的精神，在成分上还占得多些哩！
    相反地我实在找不出对这种公债，还有些怀疑，还可以观望的理由了，我没得说的了。
    还有人没有购买这人民胜利折实公债的么？来！来！
                                          一九五○年一月十日
