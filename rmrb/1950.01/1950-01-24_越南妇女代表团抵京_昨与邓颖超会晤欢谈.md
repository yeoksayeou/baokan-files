Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 23rd: The delegation of Vietnamese Democratic Republic women, selected to attend the Asian Women's Representative Conference, led by Nguyen Khoa Dieu Hong, arrived in Beijing on the 21st. The delegation departed from North Vietnam in early November of last year, but due to transportation obstacles, they were unable to attend the Asian Women's Representative Conference in time. Only Ho Duc Minh managed to reach Beijing via another route, representing the delegation at the conference. This afternoon, Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, met with the entire delegation and had a very pleasant conversation. The delegation will stay in China for some time to visit. When the delegation passed through Wuhan, they were warmly welcomed by the preparatory committee of the Central Plains Democratic Women's Federation, the Wuhan Women's Federation, and women representatives from various organs and organizations. The chief delegate of the delegation, Nguyen Khoa Dieu Hong, is a member of the National Committee of the Vietnam Women's Union. The other four delegates are Hoang Boi Hoan, Phan An (both members of the National Committee of the Vietnam Women's Union), Le Ton Phong (District Committee Member of the Vietnam Third War Zone Women's Union), and Nguyen Phuong Thao (District Committee Member of the Vietnam Fourth War Zone Women's Union).
