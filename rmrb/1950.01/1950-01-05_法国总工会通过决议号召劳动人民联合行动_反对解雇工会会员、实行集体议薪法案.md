Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: TASS, Paris, 2nd: The joint meeting of the Standing Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor and the Executive Bureaus of the various trade union federations affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor passed a resolution on the report by Renault, the secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, which has been published here. The resolution summarized the achievements of the economic struggle and called on all organizations and working people to strengthen the struggle against the dismissal of union members. The resolution declared: Due to the resistance of trade union personnel, the government's bill to implement compulsory arbitration in labor disputes has failed; the National Assembly's Labor Issues Committee was forced to propose amendments to the government's bill. This amendment, although insufficient, is important. However, at present, a conspiracy is underway to delay the approval of the collective bargaining bill, thereby delaying the revision of wages. In view of this situation, the General Confederation of Labor urges the working people to take joint action so that all working people without exception immediately receive a subsidy of 3,000 francs per month, the collective bargaining bill is quickly passed in the parliament, a minimum wage guarantee regulation is formulated, the purchasing power of wages is guaranteed, a benchmark wage system is implemented when prices rise, and strive to implement the Civil Service Law, strive for the release of all working people persecuted for trade union activities, especially the heroic miners. Strive to establish unemployment funds in areas where crises are encountered, and strive for unemployment relief.

    The resolution calls on all organizations of the General Confederation of Labor to strengthen activities, defend enterprises threatened by strangulation, and in the defense movement, not only involve all workers, but also mobilize all people related to it. The resolution calls on all organizations of the General Confederation of Labor to publicize the General Confederation of Labor's economic program, especially regarding the restoration of work, construction of houses, equipment of power industry, and trade with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries.

    The resolution calls on all branches of the General Confederation of Labor to fight for united action, unhesitatingly abandon any kind of sectarianism, and unite all organized and unorganized working people. The resolution also emphasized that united action is the main condition for the demands of the working people to be victorious.

    法国总工会通过决议号召劳动人民联合行动
    反对解雇工会会员、实行集体议薪法案
    【新华社北京四日电】塔斯社巴黎二日讯：法国总工会常务委员会和总工会所属各工会联合会执行局的联席会议，就总工会书记雷诺的报告所通过的决议，已在此间发表。决议总结了经济斗争的成绩，并号召所有的组织和劳动人民加强反对解雇工会会员的斗争。决议宣称：由于工会人员的抵抗，准备在劳资争端中实行强制仲裁的政府法案已告失败；国民议会劳工问题委员会被迫提出了对于政府法案的修正案。这个修正案虽然是不够的，但是重要的。可是，在目前，阴谋正在进行中，他们企图延缓集体议薪法案的批准，从而拖延工资的修订。鉴于此种情况，总工会敦促劳动人民采取联合行动，以使一切劳动人民无例外地立即获得每月三千法郎的补贴，使集体议薪法案迅速在议会中通过，制定最低工资保证条例，保证维持工资的购买力，在物价上涨时实施标尺工资制度，并争取实施公务员法，争取释放一切因工会活动而被迫害的劳动人民，特别是英勇的矿工。争取在遇到危机的地方设立失业基金，并争取失业救济。
    决议号召总工会各组织加强活动，保卫受扼杀威胁的企业，在保卫运动中不仅要将一切工人卷入，而且要发动与此有关的全体人民。决议号召总工会各组织宣传总工会的经济纲领，特别是关于恢复工作，建筑房屋，装备动力工业，与苏联及人民民主国家进行贸易等。
    决议号召总工会所属的全体分会为联合行动而斗争，毫不犹豫地抛弃任何种类的宗派主义，团结一切有组织的和无组织的劳动人民。决议并强调指出：联合行动是使劳动人民的要求获胜的主要条件。
