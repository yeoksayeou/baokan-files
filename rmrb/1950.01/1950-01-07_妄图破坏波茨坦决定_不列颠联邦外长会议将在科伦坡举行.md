    Attempting to Undermine the Potsdam Decision
    British Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference
    to be Held in Colombo
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 5th] The British government has decided to convene a British Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, on January 9th. British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, Australian Foreign Minister Spender, and others have successively departed for Colombo to attend the conference.
    According to a TASS dispatch from London on December 27th of last year, the diplomatic correspondent of the British News Agency said when talking about this conference: "The discussions will include all aspects of the British Commonwealth's foreign and economic policies," but above all problems is the so-called "prevention of the spread of communism in Southeast Asia, and the impact of the Communist victory in China on the Indian subcontinent." In addition to issuing a final communique, the meeting will be held in secret. It can be judged from the reporter's report that the meeting will discuss the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Japan that cancels the Potsdam Conference decision. The Potsdam decision stipulates that the peace treaty with Japan must be drafted by the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The reporter also pointed out: "Economic and financial experts will attend the talks. The continuing inevitable dollar shortage, and the issue of certain dominions still holding large sterling balances, will be discussed again at the talks."

    妄图破坏波茨坦决定
    不列颠联邦外长会议
    将在科伦坡举行
    【新华社北京五日电】英国政府已决定于一月九日在锡兰首府科伦坡召开不列颠联邦外长会议。英外相贝文、加外长皮尔逊、澳外长斯宝德等，已先后启程赴科伦坡参加会议。
    据塔斯社伦敦去年十二月二十七日讯，英国新闻联合社外交记者在谈到这个会议时说：“会中的商讨，将包括不列颠联邦的外交和经济政策的各个方面”，但是，驾凌一切问题之上的，则是所谓“制止共产主义在东南亚的推迟，以及共产党在中国的胜利对印度次大陆的影响问题”。会议除了发表一个最后公报之外，将秘密举行。从该记者的报道中可以判断，会议将讨论缔结一个取消波茨坦会议决定的对日和约问题。波茨坦决定规定对日和约必须由四外长会议起草。该记者又指出：“会谈将有经济财政专家出席，不可避免的美元荒的继续，以及某些自治领仍然握有大笔英镑结余的问题，将在会谈中再度予以讨论。”
