    Protect the Property of the People and the Motherland!
    Henan Province Emphasizes Warehouse Protection Work
    Many Warehouse Protection Models Emerge Across the Region
    [Henan News] Since the arson incident at the Shangqiu Prefectural Commissioner's direct warehouse, the provincial government, in addition to strictly handling the matter, has issued a decision to various regions regarding armed warehouse protection. Leaders at the prefectural commissioner level and in many counties and districts have taken this seriously. The Shangqiu, Chenliu, Luoyang, Huaiyang, Shanzhou, Zhengzhou, Xinyang, Nanyang, Guangchuan, and other prefectural commissioner's offices have successively issued warehouse protection instructions. The Xinyang Prefecture even convened a joint county head meeting, and the Nanyang Prefecture convened a conference of warehouse cadres from various counties to inspect warehouse protection work. Detailed resolutions were made regarding resolutely relying on the masses to protect warehouses, strengthening armed warehouse protection, strictly preventing sabotage by bad elements, and strictly implementing inspection systems. Many warehouse staff members have studied warehouse protection, enhanced their sense of responsibility, implemented regular inspection and reporting systems, and mobilized the masses in the warehouse locations to protect state property. Currently, warehouse protection committees have been established in the Wadian and Yingzhuang districts of Nanyang, and warehouse protection organizations have been established in the villages where the warehouses are located. The 12th Branch Warehouse in Yu County convened mass meetings of grain storage in the villages where the warehouses are located. After education, mobilization, and extensive discussions by the masses, patrol groups or patrol teams were established. Responsible cadres of the warehouse, especially after seeing reports of the burning of the Zhuji warehouse and the discovery of individuals posing as warehouse personnel stealing grain at the Ye County warehouse, convened meetings of the village storage groups, patrol groups, and warehouse landlords for in-depth education. All villages have increased their defenses and patrol throughout the night. At the sound of dogs barking, they immediately searched for suspicious activity. They also ensured that no firewood or flammable wood was placed around the grain storage houses in each village. Village cadres and the masses in Daizhuang Administrative Village, Gaoxia District, Xinzheng, also organized night watch groups to cooperate with local armed forces to strengthen winter defense and protect warehouse grain. In villages that have undergone movements such as bandit suppression and anti-hegemony campaigns, the masses' awareness has increased, and many examples of consciously protecting state property have emerged. For example, Cui Zhongxin, a member of the farmers' association in Dongbaisha Village, Gong County, discovered that the village warehouse director, Cui Delu, and hooligans Cui Shunqing and Zhang Chunfang had successively stolen 2,647 catties of grain. He apprehended them and sent them to the district for processing. The Zhengzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office issued a circular commending him and awarded Cui Zhongxin a certificate and 100 catties of grain as a reward. However, some regions still do not attach importance to warehouse protection, resulting in continuous theft and spoilage. These situations should raise serious alarms for warehouses everywhere.

    保护人民祖国财产！
    河南重视护仓工作
    各地涌现不少护仓模范
    【河南讯】本省自商邱专署直属仓库被焚事件发生后，省政府除严格予以处理外，并向各地发出武装护仓决定，各专署与许多县区领导都已引起重视。商邱、陈留、洛阳、淮阳、陕州、郑州、信阳、南阳、广川等专署均先后发出护仓指示。信阳专区并召开县长联席会议，南阳专署召开各县仓库干部大会，检查护仓工作。对坚决依靠群众保护仓库、加强武装护仓、严防坏分子破坏、严格检查制度等方面均作出详细决议。许多仓库工作人员对护仓都进行了学习，增强了责任心，进行了定期检查与汇报制度，并动员将仓库所在地群众组织起来，保护国家财产。现南阳瓦店、英庄两区已成立护仓委员会，仓库所在村均已建立护仓组织。禹县第十二支仓库在仓房所在村分别召开了保管粮食群众大会，经过了教育动员及群众广泛讨论之后，均成立了巡逻组或巡逻队。该仓库负责干部特别在看到报上朱集仓库被焚、叶县仓库发现假充仓库人员偷粮等情况后，又召开了各村保管组、巡查组和仓库房东的保管会议，进行了深入的教育，各村均严加防卫，彻夜巡逻，每闻犬吠，即伏身寻找；并在各庄的存粮房子四周保证不放柴草和容易燃火的木材。新郑高夏区歹庄行政村村干部与群众亦组织打更组，配合地方武装加强冬防，保护仓粮。在进行过清匪反霸等运动的村庄，群众觉悟提高，更涌现出不少自觉保护国家财产的范例。如巩县东白沙村农会会员崔忠信，发觉村仓库主任崔德禄与流氓崔顺卿、张春芳等三人先后盗粮二千六百四十七斤，捉获送区处理。郑州专署曾通令表扬，并发给崔忠信等奖状一纸，粮食百斤，以示奖励。但目前尚有部分地区对护仓工作仍未引起重视，连续被盗和霉烂。这些都应引起各地仓库严重警惕。
