Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 13th: The collective contracts between labor and management of the four major private yarn factories in Wuhan—No. 1, Shenxin, Yuhua, and Zhenhuan—were officially signed on December 31st of last year after more than three months of deliberation and negotiation. The contracts have been approved and implemented by the Wuhan Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau. This contract was signed based on the principles of developing production and benefiting both labor and management, and the contract clearly stipulates the rights and obligations of both parties. After the contract was signed, the workers' enthusiasm for production soared. The average daily output of the No. 1 Yarn Factory increased from more than 110 pieces to more than 130 pieces, and the output per spindle in the Zhenhuan Yarn Factory increased from 0.5 pounds to 0.57 pounds per day.

Although there were criticisms and disputes during the process of signing the collective contracts between labor and management in the four major yarn factories in Wuhan, an agreement was finally reached. In addition to the efforts of both labor and management and the assistance of the government, the spirit and vision of the leading class displayed by the workers in the previous negotiations—insisting on what should be insisted upon and conceding what can be conceded—were the most important factors in the successful signing of this contract. For example, the draft collective contract prepared by the labor side during the first consultation in November of last year was much more complete than the draft from the capital side. The labor side took the initiative to propose labor discipline and reward and punishment regulations to ensure the normal progress of production. This draft from the labor side prompted the capital side to automatically suggest that the Wuhan Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau use it as the basis for negotiation. In the final stage of negotiation, when the content of the contract had already been fully approved, the labor side, after comprehensive consideration, took the initiative to revise the spring vacation from five days to three days, and the female workers' breastfeeding time from thirty minutes to fifteen to twenty-five minutes. These concessions demonstrated the working class's consideration for the long-term interests of developing production everywhere.

When the collective contract was first醞釀 (being prepared) in early October of last year, both labor and management of the aforementioned four major yarn factories had little confidence in whether the contract could be signed and whether it could be effectively implemented after it was signed. However, after the Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Labor Bureau, and the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau explained the government's policies to both labor and management and guided them to conduct full democratic discussions, the ideological concerns of both labor and management were dispelled. In the process of signing the contract, due to the promotion of democracy and the improvement of the workers' consciousness, the aforementioned four major yarn factories developed more than 7,000 trade union members, accounting for more than 80% of the total number of workers in the four factories, and established trade union preparatory committees. This in-depth policy education and the promotion of the spirit of democracy are also one of the important reasons for the successful signing of the contract.

    应该坚持的坚持，可以让步的让步
    武汉私营纱厂订立劳资合同
    充分表现工人阶级的气魄和远见
    【新华社汉口十三日电】武汉市私营第一、申新、裕华、震寰四大纱厂的劳资双方集体合同，经过三个多月的酝酿商讨，已于去年十二月三十一日正式签订；并经武汉市人民政府劳动局批准施行。这一合同是根据发展生产、劳资两利的方针和实际情况签订的。对于劳资双方的权利和义务，合同内容都有明确的规定。合同签订后，工人生产情绪高涨，第一纱厂平均日产量已由一百十余件增至一百三十余件，震寰纱厂每锭由日产零点五磅增至零点五七磅。
    武汉四大纱厂在签订劳资双方集体合同的过程中，虽然有批评，有争议，而最后终于达成协议。这除了劳资双方的努力、政府的协助之外，工人在历次协商中所表现的领导阶级的气魄和远见，应该坚持的坚持，可以让步的让步，是这次合同签订成功的最主要的因素。如去年十一月间首次协商时，劳方所准备的集体合同草案，远较资方的草案完备。劳方草案中主动地提出了劳动纪律、奖惩条律等，以保证生产的正常进行。这一劳方的草案促使资方自动建议武汉市人民政府劳动局即以此作为协商的基础。在协商到达最后阶段时，合同内容本已全部通过，劳方经过全面考虑后，又主动修改春假五天为三天；女工喂奶时间三十分钟为十五分钟至二十五分钟。这些让步，处处表现出工人阶级为发展生产的长远利益着想。
    在去年十月初开始酝酿签订集体合同时，上述四大纱厂的劳资双方对于能否签订合同、签订以后能否有效地执行的信心是不高的，但经过武汉市总工会筹备委员会、市劳动局、市工商局分别对劳资双方解释政府政策，并引导劳资双方进行充分的民主讨论，打消了劳资双方的思想顾虑。在签订合同过程中，由于发扬了民主，提高了工人的觉悟，上述四大纱厂共发展工会会员七千多人，占四厂工人总数的百分之八十以上；并且建立了工会筹备委员会。这种深入进行政策教育和发扬民主精神，也是签订合同成功的重要原因之一。
