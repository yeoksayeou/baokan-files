    New Year's Lyrics
    Yang Zhonglian
    The red sun rises in the East,
    Snow melts and clouds scatter, shining brilliantly.
    Everyone hears the New Year has arrived,
    Beaming with joy and happiness.
    Let's ask, "Workers, what makes you happy?"
    He says:
    "Happy that the New Year brings the nationwide liberation soon,
    Workers' interests are guaranteed.
    Everyone works together to boost production,
    Opening mines, building roads, and establishing factories...
    I cherish the people's equipment,
    I am diligent during work hours,
    Industrial construction is paramount,
    Let's see who does the best this year!
    Determined to restore pre-war production levels
    Within three to five years..."
    An old farmer hastily chimed in:
    "My hometown is newly liberated,
    The anti-hegemony and rent reduction campaign is being promoted,
    Happy to have a great turnaround this year,
    With fields, land, and surplus grain!
    No more landlords to force rent,
    No more usurers to exploit.
    Let's all come up with ideas first,
    To eliminate floods and droughts;
    Then use new production methods,
    To harvest more cotton and produce more grain—
    To ensure everyone has clothing and food,
    Enjoying peace and prosperity year after year!"
    The People's Liberation Army comrades heard the workers and farmers speak with great reason,
    He also wishes to work hard until the end in the New Year:
    First, to clear the remnants of bandits in the border areas,
    Second, to liberate the isolated island of Taiwan!
    Let's curse: the evil Chiang Kai-shek,
    See where the hell you are going to escape!
    Our People's Liberation Army has a great responsibility:
    To protect the country, the people, and our homes.
    Our people have strength,
    Our country has national defense—
    Whoever dares to invade will be sent to their death,
    Imperialism should never think of showing off again!
    Intellectual Mr. Zhang,
    Excitedly also speaks at length:
    "Determined to, within this year,
    Properly transform the old thinking—
    Individualism is unacceptable,
    Backward thinking must be discarded completely,
    Understanding the principles is not enough, action is needed,
    Not just shouting impressive slogans.
    Serve the people practically and diligently,
    Wholeheartedly be a good example."
    Moreover, there is the portly shopkeeper in the department store,
    Smiling with a beaming, flushed face,
    He thinks:
    "The New Year will definitely be better than the old,
    New Year business will be even more prosperous—
    Because production is recovering and developing,
    The people's purchasing power is increasing—
    From now on, prices will gradually stabilize,
    Inflation will not be too rampant.
    I will never lag behind in reasonable burdens,
    I will be the first to shoulder the victory bonds,
    Only when the country is doing well first,
    Will my own business have expansion!"
    Everyone is joyful in the New Year,
    Everyone has new aspirations,
    Whether you are a worker, farmer, or soldier,
    Whether you are a student or a merchant,
    All for the sake of building a new China,
    Unite and contribute strength.
    Chairman Mao Zedong said it well:
    "There are difficulties, there are solutions, there is hope."
    As long as everyone works hard,
    A prosperous China will have boundless joy!

    新年唱词
    杨钟濂  
    红红太阳出东方，
    雪消云散光万丈，
    人人听说新年到，
    眉开眼笑喜洋洋。
    问一声：“工人们你喜什么事？”
    他说：
    “喜的新年全国快解放，
    工人利益有保障。
    大家齐心搞生产，
    开矿筑路兴工厂……
    人民器材我爱惜，
    工作时间我紧张，
    工业建设顶重要，
    看谁今年搞的棒！
    决心三年五年内，
    恢复战前生产量……
    老农连忙插嘴把话讲：
    “我的家乡新解放，
    反霸减租正推广，
    喜的今年大翻身，
    有田有地有余粮！
    没有地主再逼租，
    没有债主敲竹杠。
    大家先来出主意，
    消灭水灾和旱荒；
    再用生产新方法，
    多收棉花多产粮——
    要使大家有穿还有吃，
    年年岁岁享安康！”
    解放军同志听到工农讲的怪有理，
    他也愿新年努力打到底：
    一把边疆残匪来肃清，
    二把台湾孤岛来解放！
    骂一声：万恶的蒋介石，
    瞧你妈的还向那里去逃亡！
    咱们解放军责任大：
    保国保民保家乡。
    咱们人民有力量，
    咱们国家有国防——
    谁来侵略谁送死，
    帝国主义休想再逞强！
    知识分子张先生，
    兴高采烈也来说短长：
    “决心要在今年内，
    好好改造旧思想——
    个人主义要不得，
    落后思想丢精光，
    懂了道理还要做，
    不单是名词口号喊得震天响。
    脚踏实地服务为人民，
    全心全意来做一个好榜样。”
    更有那，百货店里胖掌柜，
    笑眯眯的满脸发红光，
    他想道：
    “新年定比旧年好，
    新年生意更兴旺——
    只因是生产恢复与发展，
    人民购买力量较增强——
    从此物价渐趋稳定了，
    通货不会太膨胀。
    合理负担我决不落后，
    胜利公债我先来担当，
    惟有国家先搞好，
    自家营业才会有扩张！”
    新年人人喜洋洋，
    人人皆有新愿望，
    不管你是工、农、兵，
    不管你是学与商，
    总为的建设新中国，
    团结一致出力量。
    毛泽东主席讲的好：
    “有困难、有办法、有希望。”
    只要大伙儿好好干，
    富强中国乐无疆！
