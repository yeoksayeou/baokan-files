Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 2nd: TASS, Moscow -- Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko received Finnish Republic Envoy Santero on December 31, 1949, at the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and informed Santero that, according to reliable information obtained by the Soviet authorities, there are still more than 300 Soviet citizens who are war criminals in Finland. This violates the treaty; according to the treaty, the Finnish government has the obligation to take all necessary measures to ensure the extradition of all Soviet citizens in Finland in order to bring them to justice for violating Soviet law by betraying the country or collaborating with the enemy during the war. Among these 300 people, there are 56 war criminals who have committed the most serious crimes against the Soviet Union. The Finnish government is aware of these individuals. Now, a list of these individuals is being sent separately to the Finnish government.

The Soviet authorities have also obtained information that the Finnish authorities are providing some of the above-mentioned criminals with forged documents bearing false names, which is helping the criminals to hide and continue to carry out hostile activities against the Soviet Union.

The Soviet government would like to know why the Finnish government has violated the treaty and the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed in April 1948, and has not yet extradited the above-mentioned war criminals to the Soviet authorities. In the aforementioned treaty, the Finnish government declared its determination to act in a spirit of cooperation and friendship.

    芬兰窝藏苏联战犯
    苏联政府提出质问
    【新华社北京二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯于一九四九年十二月三十一日在苏联外交部接见芬兰共和国公使桑斯特罗维姆，并通知桑氏称：据苏联当局所获可靠消息，苏联公民当中有三百余名战争罪犯现仍在芬兰境内。这是违反和约的；按条约规定，芬兰政府有义务采取一切的必要措施，保证引渡在芬兰境内的全体苏联公民，以便把他们因在战争期间叛国或通敌而违背苏联法律的行为交付审判。这三百多人中，并包括五十六名曾对苏联犯过最严重罪状的战犯。芬兰政府是知道这些人的。现在，这些人的名单正另行送交芬兰政府。
    苏联当局又获得消息：芬兰当局正以填写着假名字的伪造证件供给上列某些罪犯，这种作法是帮助罪犯们隐藏起来并继续进行敌对苏联的活动。
    苏联政府愿意知道为什么芬兰政府竟违反和约与一九四八年四月所签订的苏芬友好合作与互助条约，迄今还不把上述战犯引渡给苏联当局。在上述条约中，芬兰政府曾申明它将本着合作与友好精神行事的决心。
