　　　　I. International Slave Trade

　　The "International Refugee Organization" is not an organization for sending war refugees back to their homelands, but an agency used by British and American capitalist imperialists to recruit special agents, and also a slave trading agency, providing cheap labor to British and American monopoly capitalists. Let's talk about its slave trade.

　　From July 1, 1947, to August 31, 1949, the "International Refugee Organization" only sent 66,000 war refugees back to their original lands; while the number of people "relocated" to other countries reached 600,000. The so-called "relocation" means going to the United States, Canada, and Australia to do hard labor. They only want the strongest people!

　　　　II. Forty Million Unemployed in the Capitalist World

　　Even according to official statistics, the number of unemployed in the United States is 4 million. But according to union estimates, the number of unemployed is 6 million. This only refers to those who are completely unemployed. In addition to the completely unemployed, there are 18 million who are partially unemployed, meaning they only have work for part of the time.

　　The entire capitalist world has a total of 40 million completely unemployed and partially unemployed people. Conversely, there are no unemployed people in the socialist Soviet Union!

　　　　III. Atomic Bomb Propagandists Frightened

　　When the American imperialists thought they had a monopoly on the secrets of the atomic bomb, the international imperialists exaggerated the destructive power of the atomic bomb every day, saying how powerful it was, to scare those with neurasthenia. Now, knowing that the Soviet Union also has atomic bombs, they quickly changed their propaganda tone, saying how little to fear it is.

　　The American troops stationed in Frankfurt are listening to a lecture on "What to do in case of an atomic bomb attack?" The speaker told them:

　　"An atomic bomb explosion is the same as an ordinary explosion. Lie down, preferably in a depression, and hide behind a wall. Anything can be used to cover yourself, raincoats, newspapers, tarpaulins, etc...."

　　U.S. Army Major General Bliss, in the *Chicago Daily News*, advised Americans to quickly flee to the basement in the event of an atomic bomb attack, and preferably wear white pants, because white cloth reflects all the heat rays.

　　Sweden's *Stockholm Morning News* published the invention of Radcliffe (British atomic bomb defense teacher), saying that if attacked by an atomic bomb, the emergency method is to send the injured to the bathhouse and wash the whole body with soap and water.

　　If you can defend against the damage of an atomic bomb explosion by covering your body with newspapers and wearing white pants, and if you can eliminate its damage by washing your whole body with soap and water, then why did you brag about how terrible the atomic bomb was before you knew that the Soviet Union had atomic bombs?! This shows that the imperialist propagandists themselves were panicked by the fact that "the Soviet Union also has atomic bombs!"

　　　　IV. Who Will Be Cannon Fodder?

　　American imperialist war-mongers are manufacturing a third world war. But who will fight? This question is quite difficult to solve.

　　The American Bradley has already announced that the task the United States will undertake in a future world war is strategic bombing. This means that the United States will not send people.

　　Then, who will be cannon fodder? The British Major General Foel published an article in the Labour Party's *People's Daily*, also worried about this issue. Foel said that the British are certainly unwilling to be cannon fodder. What about the French? He said that the French are "usually unreasonable," meaning they are unwilling to risk their lives for American usurers. Therefore, he believes that the people of West Germany and Spain can be used as cannon fodder, saying: "Whether there are atomic bombs or not, without the participation of West Germany and Spain, Western Europe does not have enough manpower."

　　This is why Britain and the United States want to include West Germany and Spain in the "Atlantic Alliance."

　　But, which enlightened people of Western Europe are willing to be cannon fodder for American imperialism?

    世界万花筒
    福英
            一、国际奴隶贸易
    “国际难民组织”并不是遣送战争难民回归故乡的组织，而是英美资本帝国主义者利用来招募特务人员的机关，也是奴隶买卖机关，以便宜的劳动供给英美独占资本家。我们现在单讲其奴隶贸易吧。
    “国际难民组织”从一九四七年七月一日至一九四九年八月三十一日这一期间内，遣送战争难民回归原土的人数，只有六万六千人；而被“移居”他国的人数却达六十万人。所谓“移居”，就是到美国、加拿大、和澳洲去做苦工，只有身体最壮的人，它们才要呢！
            二、资本主义世界四千万人失业
    美国失业人数，就使是根据官方的统计，也有四百万人。但照工会的估计，失业人数为六百万人。这只是指完全失业者而言。除完全失业者之外，尚有一千八百万人是半失业者，即只有一部分时间有工作做的。
    整个资本主义世界，完全失业者和半失业者共计有四千万人。反之，在社会主义的苏联却没有失业者！
            三、原子弹宣传家被吓昏了
    当美国帝国主义者自以为独占着原子弹秘密的时候，国际帝国主义者天天在夸大原子弹的破坏力，说是如何如何厉害，来吓唬那些神经衰弱者们。现在，知道了苏联也有原子弹，就连忙改变其宣传语调，说是如何不足怕了。
    美国驻佛兰克福的军队在听着“遇原子弹攻击时该怎么办？”的演讲。讲者对他们说：
    “原子弹的爆炸和普通的爆炸一样。躺下去，最好躺在凹处，躲在墙后。有什么东西都可拿来盖在身上，雨衣、报纸、蓬布都可。……”
    美国陆军少将勃里斯在《芝加哥每日新闻》上却劝告美国人如遇原子弹轰炸时，赶快逃入地下室，最好是穿白色裤子，因为白色布会反射一切的热的线。
    瑞典的斯笃哥姆《晨报》，登载了拉德克里夫（英国原子弹防御的教师）的发明，说如遭原子弹轰炸，救急的方法，是把伤者送至洗浴场，用肥皂和水洗全身。
    如果用报纸盖住身体，穿白色裤子就可以防御原子弹爆炸之侵害，如果用肥皂和水洗全身就可以消除其侵害，那末，为什么在知道苏联有原子弹以前却大吹原子弹如何可怕的牛屁呢？！这表明帝国主义的宣传家自己被“苏联也有原子弹”这一事实吓得仓惶失措了！
            四、谁当炮灰？
    美帝国主义战争贩子正在制造第三次世界大战。但是，谁去打仗呢？这个问题是颇难解决的。
    美国的勃莱特雷已经宣布过，美国在未来的世界大战中所担任的任务是战略轰炸。这即是说，美国不出人。
    那末，谁当炮灰呢？英国的福尔少将在工党的《人民报》上发表文章，也担心这个问题。福尔说，英国人当然是不愿当炮灰的。法国人吗？他说，法国人“通常是不服理的”，这即是说，不愿为美国的高利贷者去拚命的。于是，他认为可当炮灰的是西德和西班牙的人民，他说：“不论有原子弹或没有原子弹，如果没有西德和西班牙加入，西欧是没有足够的人力的。”
    这就是为什么英美要把西德和西班牙包括入“大西洋联盟”之缘故。
    可是，西欧的觉悟的人民，有谁愿意替美帝国主义当炮灰呢？
