Buying Public Bonds is a Glorious Task for Overseas Chinese
Wang Dafu

	I. Overseas Chinese are a Component of the People's Regime

The New Democratic People's Liberation War has achieved complete victory on the mainland, with the exception of Tibet. The remaining few areas, such as Taiwan and Hainan Island, will inevitably be completely liberated in the near future. The war is about to end, and peaceful construction is beginning. 1950 will be a year of comprehensive economic recovery.

The Central People's Government, in order to enrich financial expenditures, ensure the final victory of the Liberation War, and increase investment in production and construction, has decided to issue 200 million shares of the People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds starting in January 1950. It calls on industry and commerce to actively purchase these bonds to complete the initial tasks of the new construction endeavors. In terms of the total amount of the bonds, it is slightly less than one-third of the government's investment in production and construction in 1950. In terms of making up for the fiscal deficit, the funds obtained from selling the bonds are invested in the Liberation War and production enterprises. Therefore, it is not simply a fiscal expense, but a capital accumulation with productive returns. For bond purchasers, it is a form of in-kind savings; for the state's utilization, it is an increase in national wealth. Therefore, the bond itself is constructive and is the people's investment in national production and construction.

Because farmers already bear a huge burden of agricultural taxes, the government entrusts the task of selling public bonds to the industrial and commercial sectors at home and abroad. Overseas Chinese are one of the forces of the New Democratic Revolution and also one of the constituents of the Central People's Government. Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference:

"Our conference includes more than 600 representatives, representing all democratic parties, people's organizations, the People's Liberation Army, various regions, various ethnic groups, and overseas Chinese throughout China. This indicates that our conference is a conference of great unity of the people of the whole country."

At the same time, the preamble to the Common Program of the CPPCC also states that overseas Chinese are a part of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front regime. The CPPCC meeting, in order to protect the rights and interests of overseas Chinese stipulated in Article 58 of the Common Program: "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China should do its best to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese." Therefore, overseas Chinese are not only protected by the Central People's Government but also participate in national government work.

Overseas Chinese are so respected and protected in the New Democratic regime because they have made significant contributions and have a glorious history in all previous revolutions in China. Even during the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, from 1937 to October 1940, overseas Chinese purchased national salvation bonds and the First National Defense Bonds, totaling 294 million old French currency. This does not include donations to the Red Cross Society, the Aviation Association, the Kuomintang armies of various provinces, and other cultural, educational, and group organizations. In terms of material contributions, before October 1940, overseas Chinese donated a total of 217 aircraft, 27 tanks, 1,000 ambulances, 10,000 bags of Siamese rice, medicines, raincoats, rubber shoes, and other supplies, totaling 350 million yuan, equivalent to approximately US$106 million.

In the past, the huge contributions of overseas Chinese to the motherland were undermined by the reactionary Kuomintang government's compromise with Japan during the war, its concessions to the Japanese invaders, and its collusion with American imperialism to invade China. Ostensibly resisting Japan, it secretly opposed communism, causing the donations of overseas Chinese not only to fail to be used to eliminate the Japanese invaders but also to be used to attack revolutionary forces, causing the funds of overseas Chinese to suffer meaningless sacrifices. Overseas Chinese suffered more in China at the hands of the reactionary Kuomintang than they did abroad. Moreover, the reactionary Kuomintang government, during the War of Resistance and the period of launching the civil war, controlled all foreign exchange in the successive issues of domestic and foreign bonds (mostly borne by overseas Chinese). Except for those consumed in the war, most were plundered by the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. Especially during the collapse of the puppet currency and the puppet gold yuan, the Kuomintang reactionary government and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie it represented controlled all foreign exchange. Remittances from overseas Chinese fell into their hands, serving to promote American goods, speculate and monopolize, and fill their private pockets, causing overseas Chinese to suffer significant losses. Therefore, in order to protect their own rights and interests, overseas Chinese reduced remittances, weakened the economic foundation of the reactionary Kuomintang rule, participated in the revolutionary cause, and undermined its political life, fulfilling a major task.

	II. Overseas Chinese are Fully Capable of Purchasing Public Bonds

Now that the Kuomintang regime has been destroyed, imperialism has been basically expelled from the country, and national liberation is about to be completed, the task of new democratic economic construction has just begun. Overseas Chinese should, of course, enthusiastically assist the motherland in carrying out this endeavor. The financial strength of overseas Chinese abroad is quite substantial: the headquarters of overseas Chinese banks includes the Great China Bank, China Commercial Co., Ltd., Zhongxing Bank, Sze Hai Tong Banking Corporation, Wing On Bank, Bank of East Asia, Hong Kong National Commercial & Savings Bank, Overseas Chinese Bank, Hong Kong Swatow Commercial Bank, Hong Kong Guangdong Bank, Hong Kong Ka Wah Savings Bank, etc., totaling eleven. There are 168 branches, with a total capital of: 410,969,000 French currency, 46,985,000 Hong Kong dollars, 13,000,000 Straits dollars, 25,000,000 Philippine pesos, and 1,000,000 Dutch guilders.

The capital and branch institutions of the above-mentioned overseas Chinese banks are based on surveys from 1935 and 1947, but the actual paid-up capital has increased year by year, so the actual number is more than this. And its branch institutions and entrusted agent banks also often increase due to the development of its business, so overseas Chinese financial business spread among major cities throughout the China and the world.

If we look at the investment of overseas Chinese in Nanyang (Southeast Asia), this figure is quite large. According to a survey in 1930, the investment of overseas Chinese in Nanyang in agriculture, industry, mining, commerce, finance, and other aspects can be seen from the following table:

Industry	Malaya	Dutch East Indies	Vietnam	Siam	Philippines
		Straits Dollars (Thousands)	Guilders (Thousands)	Piastres (Thousands)	Baht (Thousands)	Pesos (Thousands)
Agriculture	244,000	200,000	15,000	-	126
Mining		50,000	850	-	-	277
Industry	23,000	15,000	40,000	50,000	40,698
Total		217,000	215,850	55,000	50,000	41,101
Commerce	150,000	400,000	120,000	250,000	100,000
Finance		15,000	13,000	100,000	300,000	7,926
Total		165,000	413,000	220,000	550,000	107,926
Other		11,000	26,000	30,000	-	69,000
Total		393,000	654,850	305,000	600,000	218,027

Furthermore, according to the estimate of Mr. Ge Qingfan, an overseas Chinese in Singapore, in 1940, the total investment of overseas Chinese in Nanyang reached 3.8 billion Straits dollars:

Malaya	1.23 billion Straits dollars
Dutch East Indies	1.2 billion guilders
Philippines	500 million pesos
Vietnam	305 million piastres
Siam	600 million baht
Total	3.8 billion Straits dollars

The 1940 estimate of overseas Chinese investment is more accurate. If each Straits dollar is calculated at 3,650 yuan in cash according to the Shanghai Bank of China listing on December 23, 1949 (the telegraphic transfer price of Straits dollars is 5,300 yuan), it translates into 138.7 trillion people's currency.

The above only refers to the investment of overseas Chinese in Nanyang. In addition, there are no reliable statistics on the investment of overseas Chinese in the Americas, Africa, Europe, and Australia. In addition to the fact that large overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen have always had a large amount of remittances back to the country every year, and investment in domestic industry and commerce is not counted, even for small and medium-sized overseas Chinese merchants and laborers, the amount of remittances back home every year is not small. According to Mr. Chen Da's survey, before 1940, among every 100 overseas Chinese households in Nanyang remitting money back to Fujian and Guangdong provinces to provide for family living expenses and children's education expenses, merchants accounted for 51 households (including 10 trading merchants, 14 shop assistants, 9 store managers, and 18 shop owners), laborers accounted for 38 households, and others accounted for 11 households. The average monthly income per household was 66.2 yuan, of which 53 yuan was remitted back to the country, and the remaining 13.2 yuan was kept for petty expenses. This shows the universality of overseas Chinese remittances and the depth of their love for the motherland.

According to the estimate of Japanese scholar Tamura Hisashi, the investment profits received by overseas Chinese in Nanyang in 1940 were approximately US$371 million, plus family support remittances of US$180 million, totaling US$551 million. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, overseas Chinese remittances were US$130 million in 1946, US$80 million in 1947, and US$60 million in 1948. The gradual decline in overseas remittances after the victory of the War of Resistance was mainly due to the economic collapse and foreign exchange plundering of the Kuomintang bandits, in addition to the economic panic in various countries affecting the income of overseas Chinese, which made overseas Chinese unwilling to remit money back to the country through the hands of the Kuomintang bandit banks, and most of them were remitted back through overseas Chinese remittance agencies and overseas Chinese banks.

According to the above brief description of the financial resources of overseas Chinese, they are fully capable of purchasing People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds. The People's Victory Public Bonds total 200 million shares, which is not a large number. If calculated based on the total number of four wholesale prices published in the Beijing People's Daily on December 26, 1949 (each "share" of the public bond is based on the real goods of 6 catties of rice, 1.5 catties of flour, 4 feet of white fine cloth, and 16 catties of coal. The author calculates the total price of Xiaozhan rice, Wanshoushan vermicelli, Wufu cloth, and Mentougou raw coal in Beijing according to the prescribed quantities), the total is 2,907.6 billion people's currency. Calculated at the exchange rate of US$20,700 on the same day, it is only about US$140 million. This number is very small, whether in terms of the investment of overseas Chinese abroad, the profits earned by overseas Chinese from annual investments, or the remittances of overseas Chinese.

The previous section stated that the investment of overseas Chinese in Nanyang, when converted from Straits dollars to Renminbi, is 138.7 trillion yuan, which is equivalent to more than 670 million US dollars at the current US dollar exchange rate, which is nearly five times the total amount of public bonds. If compared with the overseas remittances of US$350 million in 1939, it also exceeds one and a half times the total amount of public bonds. Furthermore, if allocated based on the number of overseas Chinese in 1939, which was more than 8.3 million (according to overseas Chinese from Singapore to Hong Kong, there are more than 10 million overseas Chinese in Nanyang alone. Because no investigation has been conducted in the past ten years, the old number is temporarily used as the basis), it would be less than US$17 per person to sell all the public bonds. Even if each person purchases People's Victory Public Bonds with US$17, it would only account for less than one-third of the monthly remittances of overseas Chinese, and this number is even smaller. Moreover, the People's Victory Public Bonds are mainly borne by the domestic industrial and commercial sectors, urban wealthy households, etc. We believe that overseas Chinese are happy to take on this glorious task.

	III. Overseas Chinese Should Actively Purchase Public Bonds

Overseas Chinese have a rich tradition of patriotic enthusiasm and a glorious revolutionary history. For example, in the Xinhai Revolution to overthrow the imperial system, the Northern Expedition to overthrow the Northern Warlords, the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, and the more than three-year War of Liberation, overseas Chinese not only contributed money and materials, but also many elderly and young overseas Chinese repeatedly traveled across the ocean to embrace the motherland and dedicate themselves to the glorious revolutionary cause of opposing imperialism and feudal rule in order to strive for national independence and freedom. This spirit and this virtue are not only respected by the people of the whole country but also occupy a glorious chapter in the new history.

Now, the Central People's Government is the government of overseas Chinese themselves, and the new China is the true motherland of overseas Chinese. The support and love of overseas Chinese for the new government and the new motherland cannot be described in words or writing, but only with facts can this sincerity be expressed.

Farmers and compatriots contributed unparalleled manpower and material resources in the long revolutionary war, and shouldered 41.4% of the national fiscal amount in 1950. Even with their small incomes, they made such huge contributions to the country. Then, overseas Chinese will not lag behind, actively purchase public bonds, and display the glorious spirit of tradition to serve the motherland. The People's Victory Public Bond is a constructive public bond. The principal and interest of the public bond are based on real goods. Overseas Chinese purchase public bonds is a direct in-kind savings and indirect production investment. Storing profits and wages earned abroad in the country is not only the safest and most secure, but also an accumulation of a part of the capital. In the future, when it is truly invested in production and construction, it can establish an economic foundation for the motherland and be a long-term beneficial measure.

Purchasing People's Victory Public Bonds stems from the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese to love the motherland voluntarily and consciously. Due to different occupations, different incomes, and different sizes of assets, overseas Chinese should do their best to actively purchase public bonds. Industrialists and businessmen with more income and larger assets should purchase as much as possible and play a positive exemplary role among overseas Chinese as a model for overseas Chinese everywhere. And form the purchase of People's Victory Public Bonds into a movement, and enthusiastically launch it to complete the task. Overseas Chinese everywhere should remit a large amount of money back to the country through various overseas Chinese banks, money shops, overseas Chinese remittance agencies, and overseas Chinese merchants. In places where there are no overseas Chinese banks, remittances should be made back to the country through foreign banks that are established domestically and have general branches abroad to purchase public bonds. This is a new glorious contribution of overseas Chinese to the motherland, and it is also the best opportunity to save funds for themselves.

The year 1950 of peaceful construction has arrived, and the upsurge of subscribing to People's Victory Public Bonds has surged, and workers, seafarers, and people's organizations across the country have widely launched the public bond purchase campaign. The domestic industrial and commercial circles, urban residents, and wage earners will also be organized to enthusiastically subscribe to public bonds. Overseas Chinese love the country and never lag behind. They will surely welcome this upsurge in the country, catch up quickly, subscribe enthusiastically, and contribute the greatest strength to the new motherland.

Only when overseas Chinese compatriots seize the time when the new China is starting comprehensive construction, enthusiastically purchase victory public bonds, contribute financial resources, help the Central People's Government's fiscal expenditure, restore production, make the motherland a prosperous country, and rapidly realize the New Democracy, can the status of overseas Chinese abroad be improved and their rights and interests abroad be guaranteed. Therefore, overseas Chinese purchasing victory public bonds is for their own nation-building cause and for their own long-term rights and welfare. Only when the interests of overseas Chinese and the interests of the People's Government are integrated can it be a true glorious contribution to the motherland.

We are confident that overseas and domestic overseas Chinese leaders will quickly launch and lead the movement of all overseas Chinese to actively purchase victory public bonds, and we are confident that overseas Chinese will be able to guarantee the completion of this glorious task. December 28, 1949.

    购买公债是华侨的光荣任务
    王达夫
            一、华侨是人民政权的构成分子
    新民主主义的人民解放战争，在大陆上除西藏外已经取得了全面的胜利，其余台湾、海南岛等少数地区，在不久的将来，也必完全获得解放。战争即将结束，和平建设正在开始。一九五○年将成为全面恢复经济的一年。
    中央人民政府，为着充裕财政开支，以保证解放战争的最后胜利及增加生产建设事业的投资，经决定于一九五○年一月起发行人民胜利折实公债二万万分，号召工商界踊跃购买，完成新建设事业的初步任务。就公债总数来说，只有一九五○年政府投资于生产建设事业资金的三分之一弱，就弥补财政赤字来说，是把销售公债所得的资金投在解放战争及生产事业上，因此，它不是单纯的财政耗费，而是有生产收益的资金积累。就公债购买者而言，是一种实物储蓄，就国家运用而言，是国民财富的增值。所以，公债本身是建设性的，是人民对国家生产建设的投资。
    因为农民已有巨额的公粮负担，政府把销售公债的任务，负托于国内外的工商业界。华侨是新民主主义革命力量之一，同时也是中央人民政府的构成分子之一。毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议开幕词中，首先就说：
    “我们的会议包括六百多位代表，代表着全中国所有的民主党派、人民团体、人民解放军、各地区各民族和国外华侨。这就指明，我们的会议是一个全国人民大团结的会议。”
    同时，人民政协共同纲领序言中，也说明华侨是中国人民民主统一战线政权的一分子。人民政协会议为保护华侨的权益，于共同纲领第五十八条中载明：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府应尽力保护国外华侨的正当权益。”因此，华侨不但受到中央人民政府的保护，并且参加了国家政权工作。
    华侨在新民主主义政权中，受到这样的尊重，得到这样保护，是因为华侨在中国历次革命中，有过重大的贡献，具有光荣的历史。即就抗战初期来说，从一九三七年起到一九四○年十月为止，华侨购买救国公债及第一次国防公债，共达旧法币二亿九千四百万元，其中尚不包括对红十字会、航空协会、各省国民党军队及其他文化、教育、团体的捐款。至于物质方面，在一九四○年十月以前，华侨共捐献飞机二一七架，战车二七部，救护车一千辆，暹罗米一万袋，药品、雨衣、胶鞋及其他用品，共达三亿五千万元，约合美钞一亿零六百万元。
    过去华侨对于祖国的巨大贡献，由于反动的国民党政府中途对抗战的妥协，对日寇的退让，以及勾引美帝国主义来侵略中国，明为抗日，暗实反共，致使华侨的捐输，不但未用于消灭日寇；反而用于打击革命势力，致使华侨的资金，遭受无谓牺牲，使华侨在国内受到反动的国民党所给予的痛苦，更甚于国外。并且反动的国民党政府，在抗战时期及发动内战的时期中，历次所发行的内外公债（大部分是由侨胞来负担的），除消耗于战争外，多半为官僚资产阶级所掠夺。尤其在伪法币和伪金圆券崩溃期中，国民党反动政府及其所代表的官僚资产阶级，控制了全部外汇，侨胞汇回的款项，都落到他们的手中，作为推销美货，投机垄断，以饱满私囊，而华侨遭受了重大的损失。所以，侨胞为维护自身的权益，用减少汇款，削弱国民党反动统治的经济基础，参加革命事业，破坏其政治生命，尽了重大的任务。
            二、华侨卓有资力购买公债
    现在，国民党政权已被摧毁，帝国主义已基本被逐出国境，全国解放即将完成；而新民主主义经济建设的任务却刚刚开始，侨胞当然应该热情的来协助祖国进行这一事业。侨胞在国外的金融力量是相当雄厚的：计华侨银行总行共有大华银行、中华商业股份有限公司、中兴银行、四海通银行、永安银行、东亚银行、香港国民商业储蓄银行、华侨银行、香港汕头商业银行、香港广东银行、香港嘉华储蓄银行等一一家，分行一六八家，共有资本：法币四一○、九六九千元，港币四六、九八五千港元，坡币一三、○○○千叻元，菲币二五、○○○千披索，荷币一、○○○千盾。
    上述各华侨银行资本及其分支机构，是根据民国二十四年及三十六年的调查，但实际收足之资本，逐年增加，故其实数尚不止此。而其分支机构及委托代理银行，亦因其业务之发达，常有递增，所以华侨金融业务，遍其中外各大城市。
    如果就华侨在南洋的投资来说，这个数字是相当庞大的。据一九三○年的调查，南洋华侨在农、工、矿、商业，金融及其他方面的投资，可从下表看出：业别       马来亚     荷属东印度     越南        暹罗        菲律宾
           坡币千元   千盾           千佛        千铢    菲币千披索农业   二四四，○○○ 二○○，○○○ 一五，○○○ －－         一二六矿业   五○，○○○   八五○         －－         －－         二七七工业   二三，○○○   一五，○○○   四○，○○○ 五○，○○○ 四○，六九八合计   二一七，○○○ 二一五，八五○ 五五，○○○ 五○，○○○ 四一，一○一商业   一五○,○○○  四○○,○○○  一二○,○○○二五○,○○○ 一○○,○○○金融业 一五，○○○   一三，○○○   一○○，○○○三○○，○○○ 七，九二六合计   一六五,○○○  四一三,○○○  二二○,○○○ 五五○,○○○ 一○七,九二六其他   一一，○○○   二六，○○○   三○，○○○  －－       六九，○○○共计   三九三,○○○  六五四,八五○  三○五,○○○ 六○○,○○○ 二一八,○二七
    再就新加坡华侨葛青凡先生于一九四○年估计，南洋华侨投资总额，达三十八亿坡币（叻元）
    马来亚  十二亿三千万坡币
    荷属东印度  十二亿盾
    菲律宾  五亿披索
    越南  三亿五百万佛
    暹罗  六亿铢
    合计  三十八亿坡币    一九四○年的华侨投资的估计，是比较正确，如果以一九四九年十二月二十三日上海中国银行挂牌每一坡币以现钞三千六百五十元计算（坡币电汇价为五千三百元），折合人民券则为十三万八千七百亿元之多。
    以上仅就华侨在南洋的投资而言，另外华侨在美洲、非洲、欧洲、澳洲的投资，尚无可靠的数字统计。除华侨大工商业家以往每年均有大量的汇款回国，和投资国内工商业不计外，仅就华侨中小商人及劳动者而言，每年汇款归国的数目，也是不小的。根据陈达先生的调查，在一九四○年以前，南洋华侨汇回闽粤两省供给家属生活费及子女教育费的，每百户华侨中，一年内汇款回国的商人占五十一户（其中行商十户，店员十四户，商店经理人九户，店主十八户），劳动者三十八户，其他十一户。每户每月平均收入六十六元二角，其中五十三元是汇寄回国，其余十三元二角，留着零用。由此可见华侨汇款之普遍，与爱护祖国之情深。
    又据日人田村寿的估计，南洋华侨一九四○年所收到的投资利润，约合美金三亿七千一百万元，再加家属赡养汇款美金一亿八千万元，共计美金五亿五千一百万元。抗战胜利以后，华侨汇款，在一九四六年为美金一亿三千万元，一九四七年为美金八千万元，一九四八年为美金六千万元。抗战胜利后侨汇逐年下降，除各国经济恐慌，影响华侨收入外，主要的还是由于国民党匪帮的经济总崩溃与掠夺外汇，使华侨不愿将汇款交由国民党匪帮银行之手汇寄回国，多由侨批局及华侨银行汇回。
    照上面华侨资力的概略说明，购买人民胜利折实公债，是卓有余力的。人民胜利公债，共二万万分，这个数字是不大的。若按一九四九年十二月二十六日北京人民日报所载四种批发物价总数（公债每“分”实物为大米六斤，面粉一斤半，白细布四尺，煤炭十六斤。笔者就北京小站大米、万寿山通粉、五福布、门头沟原煤四种各按规定数量折算）为一万四千五百三十八元，以二万万分计，共为人民券二万九千零七十六亿元，再以同日美钞牌价二万零七百元计算，仅合美钞一亿四千万元左右。这个数字，无论就华侨在外国的投资来说，或就华侨每年投资所获的利润，或就华侨汇款来说，都是很小的。
    前节所说华侨在南洋的投资以坡币折算人民币为十三万八千七百亿元，以现在的美钞牌价计算，亦达美钞六亿七千余万元，将近公债总数的五倍。若以一九三九年侨汇款三亿五千万美元来比较，也超过公债总数的一倍半。再就一九三九年华侨人数八百三十余万人来分配（据由新加坡到香港的华侨说，仅南洋华侨，即在一千万人以上，因近十年来未加调查，暂以旧有人数为基础），销完全部公债，每人尚不足美钞十七元，即使每人以十七元美钞来购人民胜利公债，也只占华侨每月汇款的三分之一弱，这个数字更是渺小了。何况人民胜利公债，还主要有国内的工商业界、城市富户等来共同负担呢？我们相信侨胞是乐于负起这一光荣任务的。
            三、侨胞应踊跃购买公债
    侨胞富有传统的爱国热忱，著有光荣的革命历史，例如辛亥推翻帝制的革命，打倒北洋军阀的北伐大革命，八年的抗日战争，三年多的解放战争，侨胞们不仅输款献物，而且许多年老年青的侨胞，历次不断的远涉重洋，投奔祖国的怀抱，为争取国家的独立自由，献身于反对帝国主义、反对封建统治的光荣革命事业，这种精神，这种美德，不但为全国人民所敬重，而且在新的历史上占有光荣的篇幅。
    现在，中央人民政府是侨胞们自己的政府，新的中国是侨胞们自己真正的祖国，侨胞们拥护和热爱新的政府和新的祖国，是不可以用言语或文字来形容的，唯有用事实才能表现这种真诚。
    农民同胞在长期的革命战争中，贡献了无比的人力和物力，又在一九五○年全国财政总额上负担了百分之四十一点四的重担，他们在微小的收入中，尚且对国家贡献这样巨大，那末在海外的侨胞，更不会落人之后，踊跃购买公债，发挥传统的光荣精神，来为祖国服务。人民胜利公债，是建设性的公债，公债的还本付息，均以实物为基础，侨胞们购买公债，是直接的实物储蓄，也是间接的生产投资，把在国外的利润和工薪所得储存于国内，不仅最为安全稳妥，而且是一部分资金的积累，将来真正投到生产建设上，即可为祖国建立经济基础，为长远的有利之举。
    购买人民胜利公债，是出自侨胞自动与自觉的爱护祖国的热情。由于职业不同，收入不同和资财的巨细不同，侨胞们应尽力之所及，踊跃购买公债，收入较多资财较大的工商业家，应尽可能的大量购买，在侨胞中负起积极的模范作用，作为各地侨胞的表率；并且把购买人民胜利公债，形成一种运动，热烈展开，务求完成任务。各地侨胞应通过各个华侨银行、钱庄、侨批局、侨商，大量的汇款回国，在没有华侨银行的地方，应通过在国内设立而在国外有总分行的外商银行汇款回国，购买公债，这是侨胞对祖国新的光荣贡献，也是为自己储蓄资金的最好机会。
    和平建设的一九五○年已经到来，认购人民胜利公债的热潮，已风涌云起，全国各地工友，各地海员，各人民团体，已广泛的开展了购买公债运动。国内工业界、商业界，城市居民，工薪收入者，也将组织起来，热烈认购公债。侨胞爱国，向不落后，必定迎接国内的这一高潮，急起直追，奋勇认购，对新的祖国，贡献最大的力量。
    唯有华侨同胞趁新中国全面开始建设之时起，热烈购买胜利公债，贡献资力，帮助中央人民政府的财政开支，恢复生产，使祖国成为富强之国，使新民主主义迅速实现，则侨胞在国外的地位才能提高，在国外的权益才能得到保障。因此，侨胞购买胜利公债，是为着自己的建国事业，是为着本身长久的权益与福利。唯有侨胞的利益与人民政府的利益结成一体，才是对祖国真正的光荣贡献。
    我们确信国外和国内的华侨领袖，将迅速发动和领导全体侨胞踊跃购买胜利公债的运动，并确信侨胞们定能保证这一光荣任务的完成。一九四九，十二，二十八。
