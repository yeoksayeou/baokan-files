    [Changsha News from this Newspaper] Hunan's coal reserves account for 0.40% of the national total, ranking third among the six southwestern provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Kang. Coal is also the most important source of power for many industries, mines, railways, and shipping in Hunan. Therefore, restoring and developing coal production in Hunan is a fundamental prerequisite for restoring and developing other industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises. After the liberation of Hunan, the Changsha Military Control Commission successively took over the Xiangjiang, Xiangyong, Zhongxiang, Huxiang, Guanyintan, Yangmeishan, Xiangsheng, Sandu, Yongshao and other coal mines of bureaucratic capital. Among them, Huxiang, Zhongxiang, Xiangsheng, Sandu and other mines had already ceased production before the takeover. Zhongxiang and Huxiang suffered heavy damage from the Kuomintang bandit troops. After the People's Government took over, it invested heavily to quickly restore production, investing 8,000 dan of rice in the Zhongxiang mine alone. Currently, the Huxiang, Zhongxiang and Xiangtai mines have all resumed production one after another and have begun to produce coal. The workers and staff of each mine have shown a high degree of enthusiasm in restoring production. The Huxiang Coal Mine originally planned to pump out the well water in two months, but it was completed in more than twenty days with the efforts of the workers. The output of coal mines is also increasing month by month. For example, the Xiangjiang, Huxiang, Xiangyong, Zhongxiang, Xiangsheng, Guanyintan, Yangmeishan, Yongshao and other mines produced more than 19,600 tons of coal in October, which increased to more than 28,300 tons in November, an increase of more than 40%, exceeding the original planned target for November by 6%. The Xiangjiang Coal Mine produced only 1,093 tons of coal in July before liberation, and reached 13,803 tons in November. The quality of coal produced in various mines has also improved. For example, in the past, the ash content of Xiangjiang coal was 25% to 30%, but now it has been reduced to about 20%. The management of each mine has also been improved. Some coal mines have achieved self-sufficiency and are gradually moving towards enterprise management. Before October, the Huxiang and Zhongxiang mines needed more than 50 million yuan in subsidies from the public every month. In the second half of October, they were already able to make a profit, creating conditions for expanded reproduction. At present, under the unified plan of the People's Government, the above-mentioned mines have decided to increase production by 100% next year, in order to produce 700,000 tons of coal throughout the year, to guarantee the fuel needs of the entire province of Hunan. In the process of restoring and developing production, Hunan coal mines still have several urgent problems to be solved. The first is the problem of private coal mines. In the past, there were many private coal mines, reaching more than 500. Only more than 10 had a larger scale with a daily output of more than 50 tons, and more than 90% used earthen kilns for mining. These small-scale coal mines using earthen methods not only cannot increase output and quality, but also damage the mines and affect large-scale mining. Therefore, they must be properly handled. Secondly, some coal mines have transportation difficulties, especially some rivers such as certain sections of the Xiangjiang River have been silted up, and large ships cannot pass when the water level is low, which affects the transportation of coal. Thirdly, the production efficiency of each mine is still low, with the worst requiring 30 workers to dig one ton of coal, and some mines have too many people separated from production. These situations have added some difficulties to business enterprise management, which need to be solved in a timely manner. (Guang Jun)

    湖南煤矿业逐渐恢复
    明年要作到保证全省燃煤需要
    【本报长沙讯】湖南煤的蕴藏量占全国总蕴藏的百分之零点四○，在西南川、滇、湘、黔、桂、康六省中占第三位。煤又是湖南许多工矿及铁路、航运等交通事业最主要的动力泉源，因此恢复与发展煤业生产在湖南是恢复与发展其他工矿交通事业的根本前提。湖南解放后，长沙市军管会先后接管了湘江、湘永、中湘、湖湘、观音滩、杨梅山、湘盛、三都、永邵等官僚资本的煤矿，其中湖湘、中湘、湘盛、三都等矿在接管前早已停止生产，中湘、湖湘并遭受国民党匪军惨重的破坏。人民政府接管后即大量投资，以谋迅速恢复生产，仅中湘一矿即投资八千石米。现湖湘、中湘、湘泰三矿均已先后复工生产，开始出煤。各矿职工在恢复生产中都表现了高度的积极性。湖湘煤矿浚井水原定两月抽完，但在职工努力下二十多天就抽完了。煤矿产量亦在逐月上升，如湘江、湖湘、湘永、中湘、湘盛、观音滩、杨梅山、永邵等矿十月份共产煤一万九千六百余吨，十一月份即增至二万八千三百余吨，增加了百分之四十以上，比十一月份原定计划超过百分之六。湘江煤矿解放前七月份仅产煤一千零九十三吨，十一月份已达一万三千八百零三吨。各矿产煤质量也提高了，如过去湘江煤含灰量为百分之二十五至三十，现已降低到百分之二十左右。各矿在管理方面也有改进，有些煤矿已做到自给自足，逐渐走向企业化。湖湘、中湘两矿十月以前每月需由公家补贴经费五千万元以上，十月下半月已经能够获得盈余，创造了扩大再生产的条件。现上述各矿在人民政府的统一计划下，决定明年内增加生产量百分之一百，以求全年共产煤七十万吨，保证湖南全省的燃料需要。湖南煤矿在恢复与发展生产当中，还存在着几个急待解决的问题。首先是民营煤矿问题，过去民营煤矿甚多，曾达五百余家，规模较大日产五十吨以上者仅十余家，百分之九十以上均采用土窑开采。这些小规模用土法开采的煤矿不但无法提高产量与质量，而且破坏了矿场，影响大规模的开采，因此必须加以适当处理。其次是有些煤矿交通困难，特别是有些河流如湘江的某些地段业已淤浅，水位低时载重大船不能通行，影响燃煤运输。再其次是各矿生产效率尚低，最差的要三十个工才能挖一吨煤，有的矿脱离生产的人员过多。这些情况都给经营企业化增加了若干困难，需要及时加以解决。（光军）
