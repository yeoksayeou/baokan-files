    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: The U.S. imperialists continue its Aid-the-Bandits Conspiracy to Invade Taiwan; I Will Severely Strike the Remnant Bandits in Taiwan; All U.S. Aid Will Certainly Be Completely Ineffective. The U.S. Imperialists and the remnant bandits have secretly engaged in a dirty deal: The U.S. Imperialists will provide the bandits with sixteen warships and equipment for five divisions, and continue to allocate funds to aid the bandits; the bandits will hand over all military, political, and economic affairs of Taiwan to the U.S. military delegation.
    
    The U.S. government has decided to further aid the remnant bandits in Taiwan to resist the People's Liberation Army's offensive and make Taiwan a strategic base for invading mainland China and opposing the people of Asia. To this end, the U.S. government has concluded a special secret agreement with the Kuomintang bandit gang in Taiwan. The secret agreement stipulates that the United States will provide the remnant bandits with sixteen warships, weapons and equipment for five divisions, radar equipment and aircraft parts and repair equipment for the entire province of Taiwan, etc.; the United States will continue to allocate more than 90 million U.S. dollars in remaining funds to aid the bandits, and will completely hand over the 75 million U.S. dollars appropriated by the U.S. Congress for so-called general areas of China to the remnant bandits in Taiwan for use. The conditions undertaken by the bandits are: (1) Reorganize the remnant bandit "government" in Taiwan, and let Wu Guozhen, Sun Liren, and other lackeys favored by U.S. imperialism take charge of Taiwan's political and military affairs; (2) The U.S. government will send a military delegation to Taiwan, and the delegation will send various advisors to control various institutions of the remnant bandit "government" and take charge of all military, political, and economic affairs of Taiwan. U.S. imperialism is prepared, if the above-mentioned assistance to the remnant bandits still cannot stop the advance of the People's Liberation Army, to directly occupy Taiwan in the name of requesting the United Nations to take over.
    
    The deal between the Kuomintang bandit gang and the U.S. government was negotiated by Zheng Jiemin, a close confidant and secret agent of Chiang Kai-shek, during a trip to the United States in mid-November, and the specific terms were negotiated by Yu Dawei, deputy director of the Political Affairs Committee of the bandit's "Southeast Military and Political Office," during a trip to the United States. Zheng Jiemin nominally went to the United States at the invitation of Wedemeyer and stayed in the United States for two weeks. According to a Taipei dispatch from the bandit's Central News Agency on November 30, Zheng "met with senior generals such as Wedemeyer" in the United States. In fact, Zheng also kowtowed to Marshall, the planner of the U.S. aggression plan. Zheng returned to China on November 29, and on December 7, he publicly declared in Taipei: "The 75 million U.S. dollars appropriated by the U.S. Congress to aid general areas of China has reached the time for use." Five days later, on December 12, the Taipei dispatch of the bandit's Central News Agency relayed an urgent dispatch from the Associated Press on the 12th: "The United States has decided to prepare to provide economic and diplomatic assistance to President Chiang in Taiwan for his counterattack against the Chinese Communists on the mainland, and new military assistance will be coming in an endless stream. ... The Economic Cooperation Administration currently in Taiwan will continue to assume important missions." The day after the news was released, on December 13, Yu Dawei left Taiwan for Hong Kong and then went to the United States, accompanied by Moray, chief representative of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration in China, and McDonald, U.S. consul general in Taiwan.
    
    Both the U.S. and the bandits are actively implementing the above-mentioned secret agreement. Wu Guozhen was appointed as the pseudo-chairman of Taiwan Province on December 15, and Sun Liren, in addition to serving as the bandit's Taiwan Defense Commander, has also been appointed as the deputy commander of the bandit's Southeast Military and Political Office. The first thing Wu did after taking office as the pseudo-chairman was to submit a plan to the "Taiwan Provincial U.S. Aid Joint Committee" to apply for the use of the remaining U.S. aid funds, requesting to use 10.05 million U.S. dollars of the funds before February 15, 1950. According to foreign press agency reports on December 29, 32 U.S. military officers and a group of U.S. civilian personnel have arrived in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan Province. At the same time, the U.S. government's further assistance to the remnant bandits has also begun. A batch of silver coins minted in the United States and stored in the Philippines has been transported to Taipei by Chennault's so-called "Civil Air Transport" since December 27. According to a Taipei dispatch from the Central News Agency last month on the 28th, this batch of silver dollars totals more than 5,000 boxes, with a total value of approximately 20 million U.S. dollars. According to the U.S. Information Service, an official U.S. agency, 250 U.S.-made tanks and other military weapons have been successively shipped to southern Taiwan. The U.S. Department of the Navy publicly announced on the 29th of last month that the U.S. Department of the Navy would send an aircraft carrier of 27,000 tons and two destroyers to the Asian seas to expand the U.S. Seventh Task Force. The Navy Department also stated: "The Seventh Task Force constitutes a mobile force, ready to support U.S. national policy and serve as a stabilizing force in the Western Pacific." These facts fully expose the ferocious face of the U.S. imperialist government's determination to continue to be hostile to the Chinese people. However, it should be pointed out that the heroic Chinese people, who have seized countless U.S.-made equipment, will never be intimidated by a few warships and tanks. The severe blow of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the remnant bandits in Taiwan will render all this U.S. aid completely ineffective.

    美帝继续援匪阴谋侵台
    我将严重打击台湾残匪
    一切美援定必完全无效
    美帝与残匪又秘密进行了一项肮脏买卖：美帝供给匪方十六艘军舰、五个师的装备，继续拨付援匪款项；匪方将台湾全部军政经济交美军事代表团掌管。
    【新华社北京三日电】美国政府已决定进一步援助台湾残匪，抵抗人民解放军的进攻，使台湾成为侵略中国大陆和反对亚洲人民的战略基地。为此目的，美国政府已与台湾国民党匪帮成立一项专门的秘密协议。该项秘密协议规定：美国供给残匪十六艘军舰，五个师的武器装备，台湾全省的雷达设备及飞机零件和修理设备等；美国继续拨付九千多万美元的援匪剩余款项，并将美国国会通过的所谓用于中国一般地区的七千五百万美元的拨款完全交给台湾残匪使用。匪方担任的条件则为：（一）改组台湾残匪“政府”，由美帝国主义的宠信走狗吴国桢、孙立人等掌管台湾的政治军事；（二）美国政府派遣军事代表团驻台，该代表团派遣各种顾问控制残匪“政府”的各种机构，掌管台湾的全部军政和经济，美帝国主义准备在执行上述对残匪的援助仍然不能阻止人民解放军的前进时，即以请求联合国出面代管为名，直接下手占领台湾。
    国民党匪帮与美国政府间的这项买卖，是由蒋介石亲信特务头子郑匪介民在十一月中旬赴美商妥，并由匪“东南军政长官公署”政务委员会副主任委员俞大维去美议定具体条款。郑匪介民名义上是应魏德迈邀请赴美，在美曾逗留两个星期。据匪中央社十一月三十日台北电称：郑匪在美“曾会晤魏德迈等高级将领”。实际上郑匪还叩见了美国侵略计划策划人马歇尔。郑匪于十一月二十九日返国，十二月七日即在台北公开声称：“美国会前通过之援助中国一般地区七千五百万美元款项，已达使用时间。”隔了五天，匪中央社台北十二月十二日电即转播美联社十二日急电说：“美国决准备以经济及外交双重援助蒋总裁在台湾对大陆上中共之反攻，新的军事援助即将源源而来。……刻在台湾之经合署将继续负起重大使命。”在该项消息发表后第二天，十二月十三日，俞匪大维即离台转港赴美，同行者有美经合总署驻匪首席代表莫逸及美驻台总领事麦克唐纳。
    美匪双方对于上述秘密协议已在积极执行之中。吴匪国桢已于十二月十五日被任命为台湾省伪主席，孙匪立人除任匪台湾防卫司令外，又已被任命为匪东南军政长官公署副长官。吴匪就任伪主席后的第一件事就是向“台省美援联合委员会”提出了申请动用美援剩余款项的计划书，要求在一九五○年二月十五日以前动用该项款项中的一千零五十万美元。据十二月廿九日外国通讯社消息，已有三十二个美国军官和一批美国文职人员抵达台湾省会台北。与此同时，美国政府对残匪的进一步援助亦已开始，美国铸造的存放在菲律宾的一宗银币，已于十二月二十七日起，由陈纳德的所谓“民航队”向台北运输。据中央社台北上月二十八日电：这批银元共五千多箱，总值约达美金二千万元。又据美国官方的美新闻处透露：美制坦克二百五十辆及其他军火武器，已陆续运抵台湾南部。美海军部则于上月二十九日公开宣布：美海军部将派出一艘二万七千吨的航空母舰和两艘驱逐舰至亚洲海面，以扩大美国第七特种舰队。该海军部并称：“第七特种舰队构成一个流动的力量，随时准备用来支持美国的国策，并且作为西太平洋的一个稳定性力量。”这些事实充分地暴露了美国帝国主义政府决心继续与中国人民为敌的凶恶面目。但是，应当指出，缴获了无数美式装备的英勇的中国人民，决不是几艘兵舰和几辆坦克可以吓倒的。中国人民解放军对于台湾残匪的严重打击将使这一切美援完全无效。
