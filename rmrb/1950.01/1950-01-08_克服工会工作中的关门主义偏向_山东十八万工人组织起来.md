    Overcoming Closed-Door Tendencies in Trade Union Work
    180,000 Workers in Shandong Organized
    256 Trade Unions Established Throughout the Province; Trade Unions in Various Cities are Currently Leading Workers in Negotiating Collective Labor-Management Contracts.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 6th] Trade union work in Shandong Province has been launched throughout the province. According to incomplete statistics, 256 trade unions and 95 trade union preparatory committees have been established throughout the province. In addition, two industrial unions, textile and railway, have been established in Jinan and Qingdao. There are a total of 188,700 trade union members in the province. The percentage of employees in state-owned enterprises who have joined trade unions has reached 80% of the total number of employees. Cities such as Jinan, Xuzhou, Weifang, Jining, and Xinhailian (abbreviation for Xinpu, Haizhou, and Lianyungang) have successively held workers' representative conferences and formally established municipal federations of trade unions. The trade unions in these cities are currently leading workers in negotiating collective labor-management contracts and are preparing to establish various industrial unions through this work to organize the scattered industrial workers. There are approximately 1.2 million workers in Shandong Province, including handicraft workers. Before the two trade union work conferences in July and September last year, the trade union work in Shandong Province generally experienced the erroneous tendency of closed-doorism. Trade union cadres who had been working in rural areas for a long time only saw some backward phenomena among the workers after entering the cities, and did not see the excellent qualities of the working class such as organization, discipline, and progressiveness. Therefore, the conditions for workers to join trade unions were set too high, and the procedures were very cumbersome, preventing the vast majority of workers from entering the trade union. For example, trade union workers in Jinan once mechanically separated the work of educating workers from organizing workers, and prolonged the education phase. As a result, half a year after the liberation of Jinan, not a single trade union organization was established, nor was a single trade union member developed. Trade union workers at Xuzhou Railway Station on the Longhai Railway conducted work in secret for a long time, which caused a lot of damage to the trade union work. The erroneous tendency of closed-doorism in trade union work in Shandong has been largely corrected after criticism at the two trade union work conferences in July and September last year, as well as in-depth assistance from the leadership. The aforementioned achievements have been made.

### 克服工会工作中的关门主义偏向  山东十八万工人组织起来

    克服工会工作中的关门主义偏向
    山东十八万工人组织起来
    全省已建二百五十六个工会，目前各城市工会正在领导各行业工人订立劳资集体合同。
    【新华社济南六日电】山东省的工会工作已在全省范围内展开。据不完全的统计，全省已建立二百五十六个工会和九十五个工会筹备委员会；另在济南、青岛两市建立了纺织和铁路两个产业工会。全省工会会员共有十八万八千七百人。公营企业职工加入工会的已达总人数的百分之八十。济南、徐州、潍坊、济宁、新海连（新浦，海州、连云港三市的简称）等城市，都已先后开过工人代表大会，正式成立了市总工会。这些城市的工会，目前正在领导工人订立劳资集体合同，并准备通过这一工作来建立各种行业工会，把散漫的行业工人组织起来。山东全省包括手工业工人在内，共有工人一百二十万左右。山东省的工会工作，在去年七月、九月两次工会工作会议之前，各地曾普遍发生关门主义的错误偏向。长久以来在农村工作的工会工作干部，进入城市之后，只看到工人中间某些落后的现象，而没有看到工人阶级的组织性、纪律性、进步性等优良品质。因此，把工人加入工会的条件订得过高，手续也十分麻烦，使广大工人群众被阻在工会大门之外。例如济南的工会工作者，曾经机械地把教育工人和组织工人的工作分开来进行，并把教育的阶段拖得很长。结果，济南解放半年后，没有建立一个工会组织，也没有发展一个工会会员。陇海铁路徐州车站的工会工作者，在一个很长的时期内，用秘密方式进行工作，使工会工作受到不少损失。山东工会工作中的关门主义的错误偏向，经过去年七月、九月两次工会工作会议的批判，以及领导机关深入下层帮助工作之后，大体上已经纠正过来；并取得了前述的一些成绩。
