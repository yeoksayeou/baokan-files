Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd: TASS Moscow, 23rd: A "News Report" observer commented on the results of the British Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference held in Colombo, stating: The British ruling clique placed great hopes on this conference: (1) The Labour government attempted to show the world, especially the United States, the "unity of Asian and Anglo-Saxon autonomous territories in the current critical period." The conference agenda included economic issues, primarily to unite the Sterling Area against the United States, which is attacking the colonial markets of the British Empire. (2) The British ruling clique believed that due to the serious failure of imperialism in China and the intensification of national liberation movements in other Asian countries, the main task of the Colombo Conference was to organize an "anti-communist front" in Southeast Asia.

The observer emphasized: However, the Colombo Conference clearly did not realize the hopes of the British ruling clique, but only demonstrated once again the weakness of the British Empire, its inability to solve the political and economic problems that are increasingly undermining this once powerful world empire. The centrifugal force of the British Empire was so strongly manifested in Colombo that the conference could not reach a universally agreed resolution. The Kashmir issue, the cause of hatred between India and Pakistan, as well as the divisions between India and Ceylon, were quietly put aside. The attempt by the British delegation, led by Bevin, to have the British Empire formally recognize the puppet Bao Dai government of Vietnam, established by French imperialism, also failed. The governments of India, Pakistan, and Ceylon did not dare to risk openly forming an alliance with a Quisling like Bao Dai.

The "News Report" observer pointed out: This is due to the influence of the national liberation movements of the Asian people, which have risen to a higher level after the victory of the Chinese people. The participants of the Colombo Conference could not but take this powerful factor into account.

The observer further pointed out: The conference advocated the plan of Australian Foreign Minister Spender to provide economic assistance to Southeast Asian countries suffering from "communist threats." The observer emphasized: Britain, already torn apart by unsolvable economic contradictions, can hardly fund the Spender Plan, which aims to support the position of British imperialism in the colonies. For this purpose, Britain must request help from the United States. The "News Report" observer pointed out that as a result, the Colombo Conference, in addition to proving the British Empire's inability to cope with the immediate problems that are tearing it apart, also once again proved that British imperialism is completely dependent on dollar imperialism, and the United States is now the main strangler of national liberation movements in colonies and dependent countries.

The observer concluded that the Colombo Conference provided new evidence that the days when imperialism could arbitrarily manipulate the fate of the people of colonies and dependent countries are gone forever.

### 消息报评科伦坡会议  指出英帝无力应付内部的分裂  压榨殖民地的日子已一去不返

    消息报评科伦坡会议
    指出英帝无力应付内部的分裂
    压榨殖民地的日子已一去不返
    【新华社北京二十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：消息报观察家评论在科伦坡召开的不列颠联邦外长会议的结果称：英国统治集团对于这个会议试图寄以很大的希望：（一）工党政府力图向全世界、特别是向美国显示，“亚洲各自治领与盎格鲁萨克逊各自治领在目前危急时期中的团结”。会议议程包括经济问题在内，这首先是要英镑集团团结起来反对正在攻击大英帝国殖民地市场的美国。（二）英国统治集团认为：由于帝国主义在中国的严重失败，及亚洲其它国家内民族解放运动的加紧，科伦坡会议的主要任务，是在东南亚组织“反共阵线”。
    观察家力称：但是，科伦坡会议显然没有实现英国统治集团的希望，而只是再次表现出大英帝国的弱点，不能够解决日益破坏这一以前的强大世界帝国的政治与经济问题。大英帝国的离心力是这样强烈地在科伦坡表现出来，以致会议不能达到一个大家同意的决议。作为印度与巴基斯坦间仇恨原因的克什米尔问题以及印度与锡兰间的分歧等等，被悄悄地放过去了。以贝文为首的英国代表团，欲使大英帝国以有组织的方式承认法帝国主义成立的越南保大傀儡政府，这一企图也遭到失败。印度、巴基斯坦与锡兰政府，未敢冒险公开地与像保大这样的吉斯林分子缔结同盟。
    消息报观察家指出：这是由于亚洲人民的民族解放运动的影响所致，后者在中国人民胜利之后已上升到更高的水平。科伦坡会议的参加者不能不计算到这一有力的因素。
    观察家进一步指出：会议鼓吹了澳大利亚外长斯宾德关于给遭受“共产主义威胁”的东南亚国家以经济援助的计划。观察家力称：已经被不可解决的经济矛盾所撕裂的英国，几乎无法资助斯宾德计划，这个计划是旨在支持英帝国主义在殖民地中的地位的。为此目的，英国必须要求美国的帮助。消息报观察家指出，其结果，科伦坡会议除了证明大英帝国无力应付使其陷于分裂的当面问题之外，还再一次地证明了英帝国主义完全倚赖于美元帝国主义，美国现在是殖民地与附属国的民族解放运动的主要绞杀者。
    观察家最后称，科伦坡会议提供了新的证据，证明帝国主义能够任意摆布殖民地与附属国人民命运的日子已经是一去不复返了。
