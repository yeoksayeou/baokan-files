    Eulogy for Ambassador Li Zhouyuan
    Sino-Korean Political, Economic, and Cultural Relations Will Be Increasingly Consolidated
    A Great Force for the Liberation Struggle of the Eastern Peoples
    Ambassador Li Zhouyuan's eulogy is as follows:
    Your Excellency Chairman:
    I am deeply honored that the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has appointed me as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the People's Republic of China, and I am now presenting my credentials to Your Excellency.
    Korea and China share a border, and historically, the material and cultural exchanges between our two peoples have been very close. However, due to the invasion of brutal imperialism and reactionary rule, the friendly relations between our two countries could not be fully realized for a long time. Now, there have been fundamental changes. In the Second World War, the great Soviet Union played a decisive role, defeating fascist Germany in Europe and defeating Japanese imperialism in the East, liberating many oppressed peoples in Europe and the East and making them masters of their own destiny.
    For half a century, the Korean people have been living as slaves under the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism. They were liberated with the enthusiastic help of the armed forces of the great Soviet Union and the heroic Soviet army, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been established and a republican government has been organized based on the continuous creation and efforts of the Korean people. The Chinese people have won a great victory in the people's liberation war against imperialism and its running dog, the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, and have established the People's Republic of China. Based on these facts, there has been a great transformation in the friendly relations and happiness between Korea and China.
    The peoples of Korea and China have constantly sympathized with and assisted each other in the struggle to establish independent and democratic countries. Today, the peoples of the two countries have developed closer and more solid friendly relations based on the common interests of the development of both countries.
    The establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will not only be conducive to the increasing consolidation of political, economic, and cultural relations between Korea and China in the future, but also a great force for the liberation struggle of the oppressed peoples of the East to strive for national freedom and peace and oppose imperialist aggression.
    Your Excellency Chairman, as I begin to perform my duties as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the People's Republic of China, I am willing to make every effort, on the basis of mutual respect, to further consolidate the friendly and mutually beneficial relations for the happiness of the two peoples in the future, and I hope that Your Excellency and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China will provide necessary assistance to my work.

    李周渊大使颂词
    中朝政治经济文化关系将日趋巩固
    对东方人民解放斗争是巨大的力量    李周渊大使颂词如下：主席阁下：
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会任命我为驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使，现向阁下呈递国书，实感无任荣幸。
    朝中两国，疆界毗连，在历史上我两国人民物质生活与文化之交流原甚密切，由于残暴的帝国主义之侵略与反动统治，使我两国之友善关系在长期间无由充分实现。现在则发生了基本变化，在第二次世界大战中，伟大的苏联实起了决定性的作用，在欧洲击溃了法西斯德国，在东方打败了日本帝国主义，使欧洲与东方许多被压迫的人民获得解放，成为自己命运的主宰。
    半世纪以来，朝鲜人民一直处在日本帝国主义殖民地地位，过着奴隶生活，由于伟大苏联的武装力量及英勇的苏联军队热诚帮助下解放出来，并依据朝鲜人民不断的创造与努力，已建立了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国并组织了共和国政府。中国人民在反对帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石反动统治的人民解放战争中获得了伟大胜利，并建立了中华人民共和国。基于以上这些事实使朝中两国之友善关系和幸福有了巨大的转变。
    朝中两国人民在为了建立自主独立民主的国家之斗争中，曾不断相互同情和协助过。今天两国人民在两国发展的共同利益的基础上，产生了更加紧密和巩固的友善关系。
    中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国之间，正式外交关系的建立，不仅有利于今后朝中两国之间政治、经济、文化关系的日趋巩固，且对东方被压迫人民之争取民族自由与和平、反对帝国主义侵略的解放斗争将是一股巨大的力量。
    主席阁下，当我开始执行驻中华人民共和国的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国特命全权大使之任务时，在相互尊重的基础上，为了今后两国人民的幸福，友善互助诸关系之愈加巩固，愿尽一切努力，希阁下予以信任。并望阁下与中华人民共和国中央人民政府对我的工作予以必要的协助。
