    Beijing Grain Branch Company's Four Grain Depots
    Purchase and Sell 20 Million Jin of Grain
    Fair Prices and Accurate Scales Earn Farmers' Trust

    [Reported by this newspaper] To solve the difficulty for farmers transporting grain to Beijing for sale and to reduce intermediate exploitation, the Beijing Grain Branch Company has successively established four grain depots: the first grain depot is in Xizhimen, the second is in Tiantan, the third is in Chaoyangmen, and the other is the Zhuoxian grain depot. In the six months from July to December of last year, the four grain depots received a total of 9,617,592 jin of food grain and sold a total of 11,600,9378 jin. They played a considerable role in promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and solving the food needs of farmers in disaster areas. Due to the different locations of the grain depots, the regions with which they conduct business also differ. Those who have business dealings with the first grain depot are farmers and rural vendors from Haidian, Xibeiwang, Changping, Qinghe, Shahe, Qinglongqiao and other places; those who trade with the second grain depot are rural vendors from Daxing, Xushui, Tongxian, Baoding and other places; those who have dealings with the third grain depot are mostly farmers and rural vendors from Sanhe, Jixian, and Xianghe; the business scope of the Zhuoxian grain depot is mainly the city and the Liulihe market in that county. Considering the overall situation last year, the grain depots were generally trusted by the villagers due to fair prices and accurate scales. In areas outside Chaoyangmen and Guangqumen, the establishment of grain depots by the grain company enabled farmers and rural vendors to get rid of intermediate exploitation by gambling dens and other elements. In addition, the grain depots have established fair and appropriate ratios to facilitate the exchange of food grain between farmers in various regions (exchanging fine grains for coarse grains, and good grains for inferior grains), so as to regulate the needs of food grain in urban and rural areas, especially in disaster areas.

    京粮食分公司所设四粮栈
    收售粮食达二千万斤
    价格公道斤秤准确获得农民信任
    【本报讯】北京粮食分公司为解决农民运粮到京后出售之困难，并减少中间剥削，曾先后设立粮栈四处：第一粮栈在西直门，第二粮栈在天坛，第三粮栈在朝阳门，此外为涿县粮栈。在去年七至十二月半年中，四个粮栈共收进食粮九百六十一万七千五百九十二斤，共售出一千一百六十万零九千三百七十八斤。在促进城乡物资交流及解决灾区农民粮食需要上，均起了相当作用。由于各粮栈所设地址不同，发生业务关系之地区亦异。与第一粮栈有来往交易关系者有海甸、西北旺、昌平、清河、沙河、青龙桥等地之农民及乡贩；与第二粮栈交易者为大兴、徐水、通县、保定等地之乡贩；与第三粮栈有来往关系者以三河、蓟县、香河一带农民及乡贩为多；涿县粮栈业务范围，主要为该县城及琉璃河市场。综合去年情况，各粮栈进行业务中，由于价格公道，斤秤准确，普遍得到乡民的信任。在朝阳门外、广渠门外等地，并因粮食公司设立粮栈而使农民乡贩摆脱了斗局等的中间剥削。此外各粮栈并订有公平适当的比率，以便于各地农民交换食粮（以细粮换粗粮，以好粮换次粮），来调剂城市和农村、特别是灾区粮食的需要。（羽）
