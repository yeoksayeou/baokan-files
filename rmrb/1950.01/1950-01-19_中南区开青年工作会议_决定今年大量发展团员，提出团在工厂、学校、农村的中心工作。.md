Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 17th. The first Central-South Region Youth Work Conference convened by the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau concluded on the 7th. Participants included the secretaries and deputy secretaries of the Youth Work Committees from the CCP Provincial Committees of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and cities such as Wuhan, Changsha, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Nanchang, Shashi, Yichang, as well as Huanggang, Xiangfan, Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, and the military region work teams, totaling more than 30 people. Lin Biao, Secretary of the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau, and Li Xuefeng, Minister of the Organization Department, attended and provided guidance. Based on the work situation in various regions, the current basic principles of national youth work, and the specific requirements for the work of the Youth League in factories, schools, and rural areas, the conference determined that the basic tasks of the Central-South Region's youth work in 1950 were to unite and educate the broad masses of young people, and to struggle for the restoration and development of production and rural social reform. In terms of organization, the Central-South Region will massively recruit members of the Youth League this year. Except for a few new areas, it was decided to launch the universal establishment of the League, and to consolidate and improve the organization on the existing basis; according to the regulations of the Central Committee of the League, some over-aged members can also be developed. The conference believed that in terms of leadership, Party committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership over the Youth League. In places where there are no League organizations or few League members, the Party organizations must regard the work of establishing the League as a regular and important task. The central task of the League in factories should focus on increasing the quantity and quality of products, practicing strict economy, overcoming waste, and developing production; in schools, it should focus on strengthening the study of new democratic theories and policies, and uniting teachers and students; in rural areas, it should focus on uniting young people to participate in suppressing bandits, opposing despots, reducing rent, distributing land, and restoring agricultural production, and emphasizing strengthening militia work, so that pure and reliable young people can participate in the militia. In this way, Youth League members can give full play to their initiative and play a leading and exemplary role in factories, schools, and rural areas. According to incomplete statistics, as of December last year, the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi in the Central-South Region had established Youth League Work Committees, with 804 League branches and more than 32,400 League members. The Youth League has played a great role in uniting and winning over the youth masses. Through the promotion of the Youth League, nearly 100,000 young students have applied to revolutionary cadre schools and joined the People's Liberation Army. In organizational work, there had been a tendency towards closed-doorism, which has been gradually corrected after inspection.

    中南区开青年工作会议
    决定今年大量发展团员，提出团在工厂、学校、农村的中心工作。
    【新华社汉口十七日电】中共中央中南局召开的第一届中南区青年工作会议已经在七日结束。参加这次会议的有河南、湖北、湖南、江西等省中共省委和武汉、长沙、开封、郑州、南昌、沙市、宜昌等市以及黄冈、襄樊等地委、郑州铁路局和军区工作团等单位的青年工作委员会书记、副书记共三十多人。中共中央中南局书记林彪、组织部长李雪峰都出席指导。会议根据各地工作情况和当前全国青年工作的基本方针，以及工厂、学校、农村青年团工作的具体要求，确定了一九五○年中南区青年工作的基本任务是：团结、教育广大青年，为恢复、发展生产和农村社会改革而斗争。在组织方面，中南区将在本年内大量发展青年团团员，除个别新区外，决定展开普遍建团的工作，并在现有基础上巩固和健全组织；根据团中央的规定，并可发展一部分超龄的团员。会议认为：在领导方面，各级党委应加强对青年团的领导，在没有团组织或团员较少的地方，党的组织须把建团的工作作为经常的重要任务。而团的中心工作，在工厂应以提高产品的数量和质量厉行节约、克服浪费，发展生产为中心；在学校应以加强新民主主义理论和政策的学习、团结师生为中心；在农村应以团结青年参加剿匪、反恶霸、减租、分配土地和恢复农业生产工作为中心，并着重加强民兵工作，使纯洁可靠的青年参加民兵。这样使青年团员在工厂、学校、农村中发挥高度的积极性，起带头和模范作用。据不完全统计，中南区截至去年十二月止，豫、鄂、湘、赣四省都成立了青年团工作委员会，团支部已有八百零四个，团员已有三万二千四百多人。青年团在团结和争取青年群众方面曾起了极大作用。经过青年团的推动，将近十万青年学生投考了革命干部学校和参加了人民解放军。组织工作中曾发生过关门主义的偏向，经过检查后已经逐渐纠正。
