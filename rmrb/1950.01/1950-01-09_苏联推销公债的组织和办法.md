    The Organization and Methods of Selling Public Bonds in the Soviet Union
    Hu Jibang
            I
    The 1950 People's Victory Indexed Bonds have already been issued. At this time, it is absolutely necessary for us to study the issuance of public bonds in the socialist advanced country of the Soviet Union, as well as their organization and methods of promoting public bonds. There have been many introductions about the issuance of public bonds in the Soviet Union, and I do not intend to repeat them. In this article, I would particularly like to introduce the organization and methods of promoting public bonds in the Soviet Union.
    Since 1924, the Soviet Union's national budget has not only eliminated deficits, but also consistently seen revenue exceeding expenditure. Taking 1939 as an example, the budget revenue was 156.098 billion rubles, exceeding expenditure by 650 million rubles. Despite this, the Soviet Union still issued public bonds annually, as a matter of custom. Among them, with the exception of the initial issuance of in-kind bonds—such as the first issue of 10 million poods (each pood equals 16 kilograms) of wheat bonds in May 1922 and the second issue of wheat bonds and sugar bonds in 1923—the bonds issued later were all monetary bonds. Looking at the history of its public bond issuance, the public bonds during the New Economic Policy played a significant role in stabilizing prices and withdrawing currency; during the period of industrialization and the Five-Year Plans, they were manifested as mobilizing internal resources and absorbing private capital to help the country's active construction; during the Great Patriotic War, the significance of public bonds shifted towards financial purposes; after the victory, the practice of issuing public bonds once a year continued. However, the percentage of public bonds in the fiscal revenue is not high, because the main source of fiscal revenue in the Soviet Union is the accumulation of the socialist economy. However, the annual revenue from public bonds is still an important item in the national budget's recurring income. Organizing and concentrating scattered funds from the people through the issuance of public bonds has played a significant role in the process of socialist construction.
    Due to the Soviet people's high degree of patriotism, the Soviet government's cultivation of public bond credit, and the great achievements of socialist construction, the Soviet Union's annual issuance of public bonds is always fully subscribed in a very short period of time. On May 4, 1947, the Soviet Union issued its second post-war construction bond, totaling as much as 20,000,000,000 rubles, and it was fully subscribed in a short period of less than 24 hours. Other issues of public bonds were also sold out within a week, and each time they exceeded the quota. The amount of public bond subscriptions reached as high as 200 billion rubles, and the number of subscribers usually reached over 50 million. Therefore, the complete sales of public bonds in such a prompt fashion was not only attributable to the aforementioned basic reasons, but also to the well-established organizational work of promoting public bonds in the Soviet Union, and the universality of publicity. Because the Soviet Union attached importance to the public bond movement (often regarded as the most important political and economic measure), the Party, government, and trade union organizations invariably elevated the public bond movement to a high level of political standards, as part of their own work tasks. Local governments, financial institutions, and savings banks also regarded the promotion of public bonds as their own responsibility. The mobilization and enthusiasm of these institutions determined the universality of public bond sales.
            II
    Due to the workers' initiative, the "National Credit Savings Association" was established in May 1929 as the only and regular social organization to assist the country in developing credit savings. Affiliated with enterprises, institutions, and collective farms, its main task was to carry out mass propaganda among the people for public bond promotion, savings deposits, and group life insurance, and to undertake organizational and service work. This organization quickly became the main driving force for the development of the above three credit businesses. Now, I will briefly introduce its organization and activities:
    (1) The organization of the "National Credit Savings Association" itself: Lower-level associations are established in enterprises, institutions, collective farms, and handicraft production cooperatives. The members of lower-level associations are: factory representatives or trade union representatives (in factories or institutions); representatives of the collective farm management committee or handicraft production cooperative representatives (in collective farms or handicraft production cooperatives); Party representatives, Youth League representatives, wall newspaper editorial office representatives, and active members among the most outstanding financial workers. In large enterprises where there are trade unions in each workshop, in addition to the entire factory association, branch associations are also set up in each workshop. Higher-level associations are set up in the Soviets and executive committees, and their members are: representatives of the Soviets or executive committees, Party representatives, Youth League representatives, wall newspaper editorial office representatives, financial bureau representatives, savings bank representatives, local national insurance agency representatives, and financial activists proposed by the Soviets or executive committees.
    The association affiliated with the executive committee of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies, in addition to carrying out mass propaganda work, also leads the activities of all lower-level associations in the jurisdiction, leading the lower-level associations to hold joint meetings to report, exchange work experience, and act in unison.
    The workers who directly lead the work of the association are the factory committee in enterprises, the local committee in institutions, and the township Soviet in farms.
    The expenses of the association: All expenses for publicity work carried out by the association established in the municipal or county Soviet Executive Committee are covered by deducting one-thousandth of the public bond income and two percent of the life insurance premiums within its jurisdiction as working capital.
            III
    (2) The "National Credit Savings Association's" work and methods for promoting public bonds: The task of the association in enterprises and institutions: The promotion of Soviet public bonds mainly involves collective subscriptions by workers, and the payment can be made in installments over ten months. The work of promoting public bonds is not only to fill in the subscription amount, but also to collect the subscribed cash on time and issue official public bond certificates. Therefore, the work of the association is continuous and should be carried out and supervised constantly. The task of the association is, first of all, under the leadership of the Party and the trade union, to rely on the active elements in the entire enterprise or institution to mobilize them to participate in the public bond movement. The promotion of public bonds in the Soviet Union must not be coercive. Therefore, it is extremely important to carry out universal propaganda and patient explanations to arouse people's spontaneous interest in public bonds with political awareness.
    The association's preparatory work before the start of the public bond movement: ① Establish contact with savings banks and obtain all notification registration forms and publicity outlines from the savings banks. ② Determine the number and selection of public bond promoters in each workshop, and select pace-setting workers and Stakhanovites who enjoy prestige in the group. Each promoter is responsible for 30 to 40 subscribers. ③ Submit a program for promoting the public bond movement to the Party branch and the trade union, convene special meetings of each workshop and department to report on various news about public bonds and the methods and procedures to be followed, and absorb active elements to join the public bond movement. ④ Designate reporters for the conference and workshops’ gatherings, and conduct preliminary briefings with the reporters. ⑤ Distribute all necessary forms and materials to the public bond promoters. ⑥ Prepare all the slogans, posters, charts, etc., and publish a special issue of the wall newspaper to promote public bonds. To make public bond subscriptions universal, local radio broadcasts should be widely used for reports and propaganda, and various entertainment groups should be absorbed to promote public bonds. ⑦ Investigate the wage fund table and the number of employees from the accounting department as the basis for determining the sales plan.
    All group meetings should be completed within three days after the public bond is announced, followed by a general meeting. The promoters can start the promotion work at the general meeting, asking those present to fill in the subscription amount, or hold it one day after the general meeting, but it should not be too long after the general meeting, so as not to reduce the efficiency of the general meeting. The promoters submit the completed subscription forms to the association every day, and the association submits them to the accounting department within two days after summarizing them. The collection and payment of bond funds and the issuance of official public bond certificates are handled by the accounting department. The association can exercise the right of supervision and urge the accounting department to transfer the bond funds to the savings bank as scheduled. The first payment will be deducted from the wages of the first half of July (if the subscription of public bonds starts on July 1). If the accounting department has a backlog, it can report to the higher-level association. If it fails to report, it shall be responsible for it itself.
    The association leads the socialist competition work, which is the most effective way to work with the masses, making each workshop and enterprise compete in the public bond movement. The competition standards are as follows: ① The number of subscribers should reach 100%, and the subscription amount should reach one month's salary. ② Ensure that the subscription of public bonds is completed within 20 days, and deliver the first cash to the savings bank on time. ③ Absorb all new employees who arrived after the deadline or employees who returned to work after leave to make up for the purchase of public bonds. ④ Excellent results in mass propaganda. ⑤ Service work for bondholders (such as notifying the lottery draw and checking the winning numbers, etc.). ⑥ Assistance in promoting public bonds to unorganized personnel such as housewives in the city, and assistance in the promotion of public bonds in counties and townships. ⑦ Set up supervision work, select a supervision team from active members, report the results of the competition, report at the factory congress, or publish it on the factory bulletin board and wall newspaper.
    Organizing an inquiry office: In order to provide services to bondholders, the association has set up an inquiry office to report the lottery date and winning numbers, and to ensure that bondholders receive advances in time, etc., in order to increase the interest of bondholders. Only after the subscribers have paid the bond funds in full can they receive the public bond certificate. Only after obtaining the official public bond certificate, can they have the right to participate in the lottery. If the bondholder does not want to take the trouble of checking the lottery, they can hand over the public bond certificate to the savings bank for safekeeping. Each certificate only costs 12 kopecks per year, and the savings bank will check the winning numbers each time and notify the bondholder of the winning news.
    The method of paying out the winnings: If the amount of the winning is between 150 rubles and 200 rubles, general savings banks can pay it out. If it is 500 rubles, the central or county savings bank will pay it out. If it is 1,000 to 3,000 rubles, the central or county savings bank can pay it out only after receiving a notice and permission from the savings bank headquarters.
            IV
    The association's task in the countryside: Thanks to the success of the agricultural collective system, public bonds can be widely promoted in the countryside. In recent years, the amount of public bonds subscribed by farmers in the countryside has caught up with that of workers in the city. The main work of the association in the countryside is roughly the same as that in enterprises or institutions, but because the conditions and procedures for promoting public bonds in the countryside are slightly different, the association also has differences in realizing its tasks. In the countryside, the township Soviet is fully responsible for all organizational mass work for promoting public bonds, and the association is in a supporting position.
    Public bond promoters are the central figures in the promotion work in the countryside. They are nominated by the township Soviet through the recommendation of the collective farm management committee, the association, or other organizations, and approved by the presidium of the county executive committee. The promoters are responsible for filling in the purchase funds, collecting the bond funds, and issuing the bond certificates among the villagers and individual farmers. The completed subscription forms are submitted by the promoters to the township Soviet at any time, and the township Soviet will check them and then transfer them to the township or county financial bureau office. The first bond payment must be paid within ten days after the purchase funds are filled in.
    The propaganda work in the countryside is carried out jointly by the association, the township Soviet, and the collective farm management committee, explaining the significance of public bonds and the favorable conditions of public bonds to the people. A congress of all laborers in the township should be convened in advance, and all social and cultural organizational forces in the countryside, such as farm clubs, reading rooms, wall newspapers, and local radio stations, must be used to carry out propaganda work. Collecting the cash for subscribing to public bonds is the most important task of rural promoters. In the past, some villagers paid all the cash at the time of subscription. This model example was responded to by all parts of the country. Many collective farms completed the promotion work within a few days, and paid the full amount of the bond certificates at the same time. For example, the "Bolshevik" collective farm once paid all the bond funds within eight days and received all the public bond certificates at the same time. This proves on the one hand the material wealth of the rural laborers, and on the other hand the universality of the public bond promotion movement and the effect of well-organized work.
    Therefore, in the Soviet Union, the promotion of public bonds has become a national patriotic movement. Gorky wrote in his article "Industrialization Public Bonds": "Our working people all understand the purpose of their regime", "Anyone who is willing to participate in the public bond movement is also participating in the cause of consolidating the freedom that they have won with their precious blood." The words of the great writer are understood by every conscious Soviet people.
    What kind of enthusiasm should the people of our new China use to greet the 1950 "People's Victory Indexed Bonds"!

    苏联推销公债的组织和办法
    胡济邦
            一
    一九五○年的人民胜利折实公债已经发行了。在这时候，研究一下社会主义先进国家苏联的公债发行情形，以及他们推销公债的组织和办法，对于我们实在是十分必要的。关于苏联的公债发行情形，已有过不少的介绍，不打算赘述了。在本文里，我特别想把苏联的推销公债的组织和办法介绍出来。
    苏联自从一九二四年以后，国家预算不但再没有赤字的存在，而且收入常超过支出。如以一九三九年为例，预算收入为一千五百六十亿九千八百万卢布，超过支出六亿五千万卢布。虽然这样，苏联仍每年发行公债，而且惯例地一年一次。其中除最初发行过实物公债——如一九二二年五月第一次发行的一千万普特（每普特合十六公斤）麦子公债和一九二三年的第二期麦子公债与砂糖公债——外，后来发行的都是货币公债。从它的公债发行历史来看，则新经济政策时期的公债对稳定物价收回通货的作用很大；在进行工业化和五年计划时期，则表现为动员内部资源、吸收民间资金，来帮助国家的积极建设；在卫国战争时期中，公债的意义又偏于财政的目的；胜利之后，每年发行一次公债的惯例仍然继续。不过，公债在财政收入的分量上所占百分比不重，这是因为苏联的财政收入主要来源是社会主义的经济积累。但每年公债的收入仍然是国家预算中经常收入的一个重要项目。借公债的发行来组织和集中民间的零星资金，在社会主义的建设过程中发挥了很大的作用。
    由于苏联人民高度的爱国精神，由于苏联政府对公债信用的培养、更由于社会主义建设的伟大成就，所以苏联每年的发行公债总在很短的时间内被认购一空。一九四七年五月四日，苏联发行战后第二次建设公债，总额高达二○、○○○、○○○、○○○卢布，竟在不到二十四小时的短短时间内被认购足额。其他各期公债也都在一周之内销完，而且每次必超过定额完成。公债认购数额达二百数十亿卢布之巨，认购的人数通常达五千万以上，所以能够这样迅速的销售足额，除了上述基本原因外，苏联推销公债组织工作的完备，与宣传的普遍，也是很重要的原因。由于苏联对于公债运动的重视（常视为最重要的政治经济措施），党和政府以及职工会各机关，每次必使公债运动达到高度的政治水准，作为本身的工作任务。而地方政府、财政机关及储蓄会等，亦以推销公债视为切身的职责。此类机关的发动与积极性如何，足以决定公债的推销普遍与否。
            二
    由于劳动者的自动发起，曾于一九二九年五月成立“国家信用储蓄事业协会”，为协助国家发展信用储蓄事业唯一的和经常的社会组织，它附设在各企业机关和各集体农庄中，主要任务为在人民中间进行公债推销、储金和生命集体保险的群众宣传，担任组织和服务工作。这个组织很快地成为发展上述三项信用事业的主要推动力。现在把它的组织和活动的情形简单介绍于后：
    （一）“国家信用储蓄事业协会”本身的组织：在各企业、各机关、各集体农庄及各工艺生产合作社中，设有下级协会，下级协会负责人员的构成为：工厂代表、或职工会代表（在工厂或机关中）；集体农庄理事会代表或工艺生产合作社代表（在集体农庄或工艺生产合作社中）；党代表，青年团代表，壁报编辑处代表及最优秀的财政工作人员中的积极分子等。在大企业中有各工场的职工会存在时，除全厂协会外，同时设立各工场的分协会。在苏维埃和执委会中都设有上级协会，其负责人员的构成为：苏维埃或执委会代表、党代表、青年团代表、壁报编辑处代表、财政局代表、储蓄会代表、国家保险地方机关代表及苏维埃或执委会提出的财政积极分子。
    附设在劳动者代表苏维埃执行委员会中的协会，除进行群众宣传工作外，同时又领导辖区内一切下级协会的活动，领导下级协会开联席会议作报告交换工作经验和一致行动等。
    直接领导协会的工作者，在企业中为工厂委员会，在机关中为地方委员会，在农庄中为乡苏维埃。
    协会的开支，设在市或县苏维埃执委会中的协会进行宣传工作的一切开支，由它辖区内公债收入中抽出千分之一，生命保险费中抽出百分之二，作为工作经费。
            三
    （二）“国家信用储蓄事业协会”对于推销公债的工作与方法：协会在企业及机关中的任务，苏联公债的推销主要为劳动者的集体认购，认购之款可在十个月内分期缴纳。推销公债工作不仅在于填写认购数额，而在于如何按时收集认购的现款和发给正式公债票。因此协会的工作是有经常性的，应不断在进行和监督中。协会的任务，首先应当在党与职工会的领导下，以全企业或全机关中的积极分子为依靠，动员他们参加公债运动。苏联推销公债绝不能带有强迫的性质。因此，进行普遍的宣传和耐心的解释工作极为重要，以政治的觉悟性引起人民对于公债自发的兴趣。
    协会在公债运动开始前的准备工作：①与储蓄会取得联络，向储蓄会领取一切通知登记表格和宣传大纲。②确定各工场中推销公债员的人数与人选，选出在团体中享有威信的突击工人与斯达哈诺夫分子，每一推销员担任由三十至四十名的认购人。③向党支部及职工会提出推销公债运动纲领，召集各工场各部门的特别会议，报告有关公债的各项消息和进行的方法与手续等，吸收积极分子加入推销公债运动。④指定在大会及各工场集会上的报告员，对报告员事先作指示的谈话。⑤发给推销公债员一切必需的表格资料。⑥准备一切悬挂的标语口号图表等等，并用壁报出版推销公债专号，为使公债认购的普遍化，更应广泛利用当地无线电广播作报告和宣传，并吸收各种娱乐团体作推销公债的宣传。⑦向会计处调查工资基金表和员工人数，作为确定推销计划的根据。
    各小组集会在公债公布后三日内应举行完毕，接着即召集大会，各推销员在大会上便可开始推销工作，请在场者填写认购数额，或在大会后一日举行，但不能离大会后太久，以免大会效率减低。推销员每日将已填妥的认购单送交协会，经协会总结后二日内汇交会计处，债款出纳及正式公债票的发给都由会计处经办，协会可执行监督之权，督促会计处将债款如期拨交储蓄会。第一次交款自七月份上半月的工资中开始拨扣（如认购公债在七月一日开始时）。倘会计处有积压的情形，可报告上级协会，倘不报告时责任应由其自负。
    协会领导进行社会主义竞赛工作，此为群众工作中最有效的办法，使各工场与各企业间进行公债运动的竞赛，其竞赛标准如下：①认购人数应达到百分之百，认购数目达一月之工资。②保证认购公债在二十日内全部完成，准时向储蓄会交付第一次现款。③吸收一切在过期后新到的员工或告假复职的员工补购公债。④群众宣传的优良成绩。⑤对持票人的服务工作（如通知开奖及查对中奖号码等）。⑥对城市中非组织人员如家庭主妇等推销公债的协助及协助县乡的推销公债工作。⑦设立监督工作，由积极分子中选出监督队，报告竞赛进行的结果，在各工厂大会上作报告，或在工厂揭示处及壁报上公布发表。
    组织问询处，协会为尽其对持票人服务起见、特设问询处，报告开奖日期与中奖号码，并使持票人及时收到进款等工作，以提高持票人的兴趣，认购者缴足债款后然后领得公债票，领得正式公债票后，才有参加开奖的权利，如持票人不愿自任对奖的麻烦，可以将公债票交储蓄会代存，每票每年仅收十二戈比的手续费，由储蓄会代为查对每次中奖号码，通知持票人中奖的消息。
    中奖付款的办法，中奖的数额在一百五十卢布至二百卢布者，一般储蓄会均可付款，在五百卢布者由中央或县储蓄会付款，一千至三千卢布者中央或县储蓄会待储蓄总会的通知许可后始可付款。
            四
    协会在乡村中的任务，由于农业集体制度的成功，使公债能广泛推销于乡村中，最近几年来乡村中农民认购公债的数额已追上城市的工人，协会在乡村中的主要工作与在各企业或机关大致相同，但由于乡村推销公债的条件与手续稍有差别，故协会实现其任务时亦有不同之处。在乡村中推销公债的一切组织群众工作都由乡苏维埃负总责，协会处于协助的地位。
    公债推销员在乡村的推销工作中为中心的人物，他们经集体农庄理事会，协会或其他团体的介绍由乡苏维埃提出，经县执委主席团批准，在庄员及个别农民中间填写购款，收集债金及发给债票均由推销员办理，填写后的认购单由推销员随时送交乡苏维埃，由乡苏维埃查对后转交本乡，县财政局办事处，认购公债于填写购款后十日内即须缴纳第一次债金。
    乡村中的宣传工作由协会和乡苏维埃及集体农场理事会协同进行，对民众解释公债的意义、公债的有利条件等等，事前召集全乡劳动者大会，且必须利用乡村中一切社会与文化的组织力量，如农场俱乐部、阅览室、壁报、当地无线电广播站来进行宣传工作。收集认购公债的现款是乡村推销员最重要的工作。过去曾有若干庄员在认购时即交付全部现款，此种模范表率即获得全国各地的响应，不少集体农庄在数日之内就完成推销工作，并且将全部债票的金额同时缴纳，如“布尔什维克”集体农庄某次曾在八日之内将全部债金缴付，并在同时都领到公债票，这一方面是证明农村劳动者物质生活的富裕，另一方面是由于推销公债运动的普遍和组织工作周密的效果。
    故在苏联，推销公债已成为全民的爱国运动。高尔基在论《工业化公债》一文中曾写道：“我国劳动人民皆明白自己政权的目的”、“凡是愿意参加公债运动的人，也就是参加巩固以自己宝贵鲜血得来的自由事业”，伟大作家的言语是每个觉悟的苏维埃人民所亲切了解的。
    我们新中国的人民应当以怎样的热情来迎接一九五○年的“人民胜利折实公债”啊！
