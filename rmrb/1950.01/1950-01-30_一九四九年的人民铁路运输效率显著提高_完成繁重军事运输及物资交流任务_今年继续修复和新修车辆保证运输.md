Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 29th: In 1949, the efficiency of people's railway transportation was significantly improved. This is most evident in the increase in railway transport volume. Northeast Railway increased by 70% in December compared to January last year. Northern Railway increased month by month from July last year. Tianjin Railway Administration alone increased by 53% in December last year compared to March, and by 64% compared to the highest transport volume of the Pingjin Railway Bureau in 1947 under Kuomintang rule. Jinan Railway Administration loaded an average of 188 more wagons per day in November last year than in May. Due to the general improvement in transportation capacity on all lines, the military transportation and material exchange tasks of last year—the most significant and arduous year since the Liberation War—were successfully completed.

The improvement in railway transportation efficiency is primarily due to the acceleration of train speed. The average travel speed per hour of passenger and freight trains, including running and stopping time, was 23.7 kilometers in the Northeast from January to November last year, exceeding the highest record of 21.7 kilometers during the puppet Manchukuo regime. The Tianjin Bureau (freight cars) increased from an average of 15.1 kilometers per hour in July last year to 19.9 kilometers in December. The average daily mileage of locomotives (i.e., average daily car kilometers) in the bureau has increased by one and a half times compared to 1947 under Kuomintang rule. The improvement in transportation efficiency is also due to the general increase in locomotive traction weight. The Tianjin Bureau increased to 1147 tons in November last year, an increase of a quarter compared to 1947. The maximum on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway during the Japanese and Kuomintang rule was no more than 900 to 1,000 metric tons. However, the results of the Zhengzhou Bureau's experiment with large locomotives in July last year increased this to 2,000 metric tons. The experiments conducted by the Ministry of Railways between Tianjin and Zhengzhou also broke the highest records of the Japanese and Kuomintang rule. Originally, the acceleration of train speed and the increase in traction tonnage could increase the damage to locomotives and lines. However, thanks to the implementation of the responsibility system for train crews and the new road maintenance method on the people's railways, the damage to locomotives and lines has not increased, but has decreased. Qiqihar and Harbin locomotive depots are proof of this: the former created a record of one million kilometers without accidents, and the latter also created a record of 500,000 kilometers without accidents. The Northeast originally stipulated that locomotives should undergo a Class A inspection (major overhaul) every 50,000 kilometers, but last year there were 12 locomotives that traveled more than 100,000 kilometers without a Class A inspection. Among them, No. 631 in Qiqihar traveled as far as 180,000 kilometers, breaking through three Class A inspection periods. The Northern lines have also begun to pay attention to safe driving and reducing or eliminating accidents. During the Kuomintang rule, locomotives of freight trains in the Pingjin area needed a Class A inspection after running 20,000 kilometers. After liberation, in the Tianjin Bureau, the average has reached more than 35,000 kilometers, and 37 locomotives have extended the prescribed Class A inspection kilometers, with the best No. 1939 locomotive exceeding 100,000 kilometers.

The speed of loading, unloading, and dispatching is also an important factor determining the efficiency of railway transportation. Therefore, the significant improvement in the efficiency of people's railway transportation is concentrated in the shortening of the vehicle turnaround rate. The turnaround rate of freight cars in the Northeast (the freight car turnaround rate is the average number of days required for a freight car from the first loading to the second loading). It had already been shortened a lot the year before, and last year it was shortened by an average of 1.62 days compared to the year before. November last year was shortened by 30.2% compared to January. December saw a slight increase due to the heavier winter transportation tasks. The Tianjin Bureau shortened by 50.77% in December last year compared to March. Because the vehicle turnaround is faster than in the past, the transportation volume has greatly increased compared to the past.

### 一九四九年的人民铁路运输效率显著提高  完成繁重军事运输及物资交流任务  今年继续修复和新修车辆保证运输

    一九四九年的人民铁路运输效率显著提高
    完成繁重军事运输及物资交流任务
    今年继续修复和新修车辆保证运输
    【新华社北京二十九日电】在一九四九年中，人民铁路的运输效率获得显著提高。这最明显地表现在铁路运输量的提高上，东北铁路去年十二月较一月增加了百分之七十。北方铁路自去年七月份起逐月增加，仅天津铁路管理局去年十二月即比三月增加了百分之五十三，比国民党统治时期平津区铁路局一九四七年最高运输量增加了百分之六十四。济南铁路管理局去年十一月比五月每天平均多装车一八八辆，由于各路运输能力的普遍提高，去年——解放战争以来最巨大而繁重的一年的军事运输和物资交流的任务得以顺利完成。
    铁路运输效率的提高，首先是由于行车速度的加快。平均客、货列车每小时的旅行速度，即运行和停车时间都在内，东北自去年一月至十一月为二三·七公里，超过了伪满统治时期最高纪录的二一·七公里。天津局（货车）由去年七月的平均每小时一五·一公里提高到十二月的一九·九公里。该局机车平均每天所走的旅程（即平均日车公里数）和国民党统治时的一九四七年相比，已提高了一倍半。运输效率的提高，还由于机车牵引重量一般地也有很大提高。天津局去年十一月已增至一一四七吨，比一九四七年提高了四分之一。平汉南段在日寇和国民党统治时期最高不过九百公吨至一千公吨。而去年七月郑州局用大型机车试验结果，则提高到二千公吨。铁道部在天津、郑州间所作的试验，也同样突破了日寇和国民党统治时期的最高纪录。本来，行车速度的加快和牵引吨数的加重，是可能增加机车和线路的毁损的。但是，人民铁路由于推行乘务负责制和新养路法的结果，不但没有增加，反而减少了机车和线路的毁损。齐齐哈尔和哈尔滨机务段就是明证：前者创造了百万公里无事故的纪录，后者也创造了五十万公里路无事故的纪录。东北原定机车每走五万公里就要进行甲检（大检修），而去年即有十二台机车走了十万多公里没有甲检。其中齐齐哈尔的六三一号竟走到十八万公里，突破了三个甲检期。北方各路亦已开始注意了安全行车、减少或消灭事故。在国民党统治时期，平津区货物列车的机车走两万公里就需要甲检，解放后在天津局，平均已达三万五千公里以上，并已有三十七台机车延长了规定的甲检公里，最好的一九三九号机车超过了十万公里。
    装卸和调度的快慢也是决定铁路运输效率高低的重要因素。因此人民铁路运输效率的显著提高，集中表现在车辆周转率的缩短上面。东北的货车周转率（货车周转率就是货车由第一次装车到第二次装车所需要的平均天数）。在前年已缩短很多，而去年又比前年平均缩短了一点六二天。去年十一月比一月则缩短了百分之三○·二。十二月因冬运任务加重稍有增加。天津局去年十二月比三月缩短了百分之五○·七七。因为车辆周转都比过去快，所以运输量就比过去大为提高了。
