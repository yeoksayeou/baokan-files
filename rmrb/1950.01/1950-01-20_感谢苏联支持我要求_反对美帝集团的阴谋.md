Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 19th: Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, recently issued a statement regarding the Soviet representative's support for Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's demand that the United Nations Security Council expel the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group. The statement is as follows:

    On January 8th of this year, Foreign Minister Zhou sent a second telegram to Romulo, President of the United Nations General Assembly, and Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, stating that the representatives of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionary remnant group remaining in the United Nations Security Council were illegal and advocating for their expulsion from the Security Council. We have all expressed unanimous support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement.

    However, it is astonishing that when the United Nations Security Council held its first meeting of the year on January 10th, the illegal representative of the reactionary remnant group, who had been abandoned by the Chinese people, served as the chairman of the Security Council. We believe this is an insult to our People's Republic of China and an unparalleled damage to the reputation of the United Nations. The Soviet delegation's speech at the Security Council this time, supporting our government's proposal of January 8th, once again proves that the Soviet Union is China's most reliable friend. The Soviet representative also firmly stated that the Soviet delegation will not participate in the work of the Security Council until the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary group are expelled; the Soviet Union will not recognize any resolutions passed by the Security Council with the participation of the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary group and will disregard such resolutions. We express our deep gratitude for this righteous act.

    From this debate in the Security Council, we can also see another aspect of the facts, that is, U.S. imperialism and its accomplices have always supported the Kuomintang reactionary group and are enemies of the Chinese people. Therefore, we must be more united in the future, accelerate the elimination of the remaining reactionary forces, and combat all conspiracies of U.S. imperialism. As for the British government, on the one hand, it expresses its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and on the other hand, it abstains from voting in the Security Council, in fact supporting the Kuomintang pseudo-representative. We will not lightly overlook this insincere diplomatic maneuvering.
            
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 18th: People from all walks of life in East China and Southwest China have expressed their firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement demanding that the United Nations Security Council expel the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group, and expressed their gratitude to the Soviet representative for supporting our just demands.

    The Third Session of the Hangzhou Municipal People's Representatives Conference issued a circular stating: Foreign Minister Zhou's statement represents the will of the entire Chinese people and conforms to the wishes of progressive people all over the world. We vow to fight for the realization of this statement under the leadership of the Central People's Government.

    The Preparatory Committee of the Guilin Telegraph Bureau Trade Union and the Preparatory Committee of the Student Union both expressed their firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and expressed their gratitude to the Soviet ally for its just action in supporting our position in the United Nations. The Preparatory Committee of the Student Union particularly emphasized: We oppose the shameless behavior of the U.S. imperialist bloc in manipulating the United Nations. Li Renren, of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, currently residing in Guilin, issued a statement stating: The Chiang bandit gang has become a band of marauders, and it is absolutely necessary for the Security Council to expel them; Foreign Minister Zhou's statement is based on the public opinion of the people of the whole country.

    The Preparatory Committee of the Anhui South District Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Farmers' Association, and the Women's Democratic Federation jointly issued a circular stating: The remnant government of the Kuomintang bandit gang has basically ceased to exist, and the "representatives" it sends to the United Nations have no legal or factual basis to represent the Chinese people. Such a "representative" who does not represent anyone remaining in the Security Council is illegal and an insult to the Security Council and the United Nations. The statement continued: The Soviet representative Malik's special statement in the Security Council once again demonstrated the consistent and firm position of the world's most powerful fortress of peace and democracy, the Soviet Union, in maintaining peace and consolidating world security, and exposed the ugly faces of the world's reactionary groups.

    感谢苏联支持我要求  反对美帝集团的阴谋
    中国民主同盟主席张澜发表谈话
    【新华社北京十九日电】中国民主同盟主席张澜，顷对苏联代表支持我国外交部周恩来部长要求联合国安理会开除国民党反动残余集团代表一事，发表谈话如下：
    本年一月八日周外长第二次致电联合国大会主席罗慕洛、联合国秘书长赖伊，声明中国国民党反动残余集团的代表留在联合国安全理事会是非法的，并主张将其从安全理事会开除出去。我们对于周外长这次声明曾都表示一致的拥护。
    但值得惊讶的是，当本月十日联合国安全理事会举行本年度第一次会议的时候，为中国人民所共弃的反动残余集团的非法代表却在安理会做了主席，我们认为这是对我们中华人民共和国的一种侮辱，这是对联合国的声誉无比的损害。而苏联代表团这一次在安理会支持我们政府一月八日提议的发言，则又一次证明，苏联是中国的最可靠的朋友。苏联代表并且坚决表示，苏联代表团将不参加安理会的工作，直至国民党反动集团的代表被开除为止；苏联将不承认安理会在国民党反动集团的代表参与之下所通过的任何决议，并将不理会这种决议。这一种义举，我们是要表示十分感谢的。
    从这一次安理会的辩论中，我们还可以看到另外一面的事实，那就是美帝国主义及其同伙，始终是支持国民党反动集团与中国人民为敌。所以今后我们必须更加团结，加速消灭残余的反动势力，打击美帝国主义的一切阴谋。至于英国政府，一方面表示愿意与中华人民共和国中央人民政府建立邦交，另一方面则又在安理会上弃权，事实上支持了国民党伪代表，对于这种毫无诚意的外交上的玩弄手段，我们是不会轻轻看过的。
            华东西南各界人民拥护周外长声明
    【新华社北京十八日电】杭州、桂林及皖南各界人民纷纷表示坚决拥护周恩来部长要求联合国安理会开除国民党反动残余集团代表的严正声明，并感谢苏联代表支持我国要求的正义举动。
    杭州市各界人民代表会议第三次会议发出通电称：周外长这个声明代表了全中国人民的意志，也符合全世界进步人民的愿望，我们誓在中央人民政府的领导下，为这个声明的实现而斗争。
    桂林电讯局工会筹委会和学生联合会筹委会均表示坚决拥护周外长的声明，并对苏联友邦在联合国中支持我主张的正义行动表示感谢。学联筹委会特别强调称：我们反对美帝国主义集团玩弄联合国的无耻行为。现居桂林的中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会李任仁发表谈话称：蒋匪帮已成了流寇，安理会开除他们是绝对必要的；周外长的声明是基于全国人民的公意。
    皖南区总工会筹委会、农民协会筹委会与民主妇女联合会联合发表通电称：国民党匪帮残余政府基本上早已不存在，由它派遣的在联合国的“代表”毫无法律与事实的根据来代表中国人民。这样一个不代表任何人的“代表”留在安理会是非法的，是对安理会和联合国的一种污辱。声明继称：苏联代表马立克在安理会的特别声明，又一度表示了世界最强大的和平民主堡垒——苏联维护和平与巩固世界安全的一贯坚定立场，揭露了世界反动集团的丑恶面目。
