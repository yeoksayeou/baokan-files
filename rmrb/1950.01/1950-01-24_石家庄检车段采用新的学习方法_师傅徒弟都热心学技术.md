    Shijiazhuang Inspection Depot Adopts New Learning Methods
    Both Masters and Apprentices Enthusiastically Learn Techniques
    [Shijiazhuang News] Workers at the Shijiazhuang Inspection Depot of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau have recently created new learning methods in the movement to respect teachers and cherish apprentices. The first is the establishment of a question-and-answer system. Every afternoon, when apprentices record their learning diaries, masters and apprentices use mutual question and answer to review the techniques learned that day. Then, the apprentices record these questions in a manual and raise any difficult questions, seeking answers from the next day's work. This can correct deviations in the apprentice's understanding during learning. The second is the establishment of a small test system. Group C inspection team holds two tests a week to check the apprentices' learning progress and the masters' teaching performance. Because of the test system, Li Fengwen and Bai Baoshan, master and apprentice in the electric welding room, learned flat welding, how to make electric welding rods, and the simple theory of using oxygen within ten days. In addition, they also launched individual competitions and group competitions among apprentices, with the master keeping scores and recording merits. Now, four more inspections have been added during the repair process of each vehicle. This not only strengthens the apprentices' learning but also plays a considerable role in improving the quality of vehicle repair. At the same time, the movement to respect teachers and cherish apprentices has also promoted the learning of technical workers. In order to enrich the learning content, Ma Qing, a master of Group C Inspection Team Four, personally led his apprentices to learn how to scrape tiles and cast tiles from senior master Zhao Yushan. Liu Fuchen from the North Station chartered car group said: "I never studied technology in the past; now that I am taking apprentices, I have to study hard myself first." In order to cooperate with the administration in promoting the further development of this movement, the Youth League of the depot decided to make this work the central task of the current Youth League branch. The depot is preparing to hold a forum for all young workers, calling on young workers to find masters, make plans, and universally improve their technical level.

    石家庄检车段采用新的学习方法
    师傅徒弟都热心学技术
    【石家庄讯】太原铁路局石家庄检车段工人在尊师爱徒运动中，最近创造了新的学习方法。首先是建立问答制，每天下午徒弟记学习日记时，师徒用互相问答的方法，把当天学习的技术再温习一遍，然后徒弟再把这些问题记在手册上，并把疑难问题提出来，从第二天的工作中去找解答。这样可以纠正徒弟学习时领会中的偏差。其次是建立了小型测验制，丙检组定一周内举行两次测验，以检查徒工的学习进度和师傅的教学成绩。电焊房李凤文、白宝善师徒因为有了测验制，徒弟十天内学会了平焊、造电焊棍和使用氧气的简单理论。此外，他们还发起了徒弟间的个人竞赛和小组竞赛，由师傅记分记功。现在每一辆车在检修过程中增加了四次检查，不独徒工的学习加强，对提高车辆检修质量也起了相当大的作用。同时，尊师爱徒运动也推动了技术工人的学习。丙检四组师傅马清为充实学习内容，曾亲自带领徒弟找赵玉山老师傅学刮瓦铸瓦。北站包车组刘辅臣说：“我过去从来不研究技术；现在带徒弟了，自己就得先好好学”。该段青年团为配合行政推动此一运动的进一步开展，决定把这一工作作为目前团支部的中心工作。段内准备召开全体青年工人座谈会，号召青工都找师傅，订计划，普遍把技术水平提高一步。
