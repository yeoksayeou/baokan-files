Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th - American ruling figures openly admit that the United States is actively supporting Japan's aggressive forces and is using Japan as its main base for carrying out aggression in the Far East. According to a United Press Washington dispatch, Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters on the 10th that Secretary of State Acheson declared at a closed meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 10th: "The United States must support Japan and make it a major bulwark of anti-communism in Asia." To achieve this goal, Acheson said, "This should be accompanied by economic and military measures." Another United Press dispatch stated: "The U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings," a magazine reflecting the views of high-ranking American military officials, published an essay by Navy officer Martin Holbrook on January 11, stating: "In the near future, Japan clearly has the possibility of maintaining its army, navy, and even air force again." Holbrook hinted that the establishment of the Japanese army was to use the Japanese as cannon fodder to save American manpower. In fact, the Japanese army and navy have already been established under the guise of land police. According to official, scaled-down figures, there are 125,000 armed police, and 2 million special police officers, or police reserves, are staffed by firefighters. The water police led by the Japanese "Maritime Safety Agency" is actually the Japanese Navy. The agency currently has 155 armed warships.

    【新华社北京十七日电】美国统治人士公开承认美国正积极扶植日本的侵略势力，并将日本作为它在远东实行侵略的主要基地。据合众社华盛顿消息，美参院外交委员会主席康纳利十日告记者称：美国务卿艾奇逊十日在参院外交委员会秘密会上宣称：“美国必须扶植日本，使其成为亚洲反共的一个主要堡垒。”为了达到这个目的，艾奇逊说：“这应伴以经济的和军事的措施”。合众社另一电讯又称：反映美国高级军事方面意见的《美国海军学院纪事》杂志，一月十一日曾发表海军军官马丁·霍布洛克的一篇论文说：“在不久的将来，日本显然有再度保持陆军、海军、甚至空军的可能”。霍布洛克暗示，建立日本军队是为了以日本人充当炮灰，以节省美国的人力。其实，日本陆海军已在陆上警察的伪装下建立起来，目前的武装警察，根据官方缩小了的数字，有十二万五千人，由消防队员充任的特别警察，即警察后备军，则有二百万人。日本“海上保安厅”所领导的水上警察，实际上是日本海军。该厅现拥有武装舰艇一百五十五艘。
