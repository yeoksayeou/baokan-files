Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 7th: The Communist Party of China's cadres and party members at all levels entering Chengdu, and the party cadres and general party members who persisted in underground work in Chengdu and other places, held a victorious meeting on the 3rd of this month in Chengdu. Comrade He Long spoke first at the meeting. After explaining the significance of this meeting, he pointed out the achievements of the underground party members in persisting in the struggle under the white terror of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. He said: Over the years, underground party comrades have maintained and expanded the Party's political influence in western Sichuan, maintained the Party's organization and protected the Party's cadres, and closely connected with the masses, organized the masses, and disintegrated the enemy, thus playing a significant role in coordinating with the People's Liberation Army in the liberation of Chengdu. Then, he emphasized the importance of unity within the Party. He called on the party members from the south and the original underground party members to learn from each other, respect each other, and help each other. He encouraged everyone with the ancient saying "Don't claim credit for achievements, don't avoid faults." He said: "All credit should be attributed to the Party and the people. If you have shortcomings and mistakes, you should first examine yourself and conduct self-criticism to achieve unity and do the work well." The comrades of the underground party who persisted in the underground work stated in their speeches that they would humbly learn in the future, resolutely implement the Party's policies, and give full play to the tenacity and enthusiasm of persisting in the struggle in the past, unconditionally serve the people, and do all kinds of work well.
