    Nanjing Central Research Institute Geological Institute
    Completes Geological Map of Guangxi Province
    Will Greatly Help the Construction of Southwestern Provinces
    [Nanjing News] The Geological Institute of the Nanjing Central Research Institute recently completed a 1:250,000 geological map of the entire Guangxi Province. This is the most extensive and detailed geological map currently available in China. Its completion will greatly help the construction of the southwestern provinces. Scientists can use it to understand the geological structure and stratigraphic distribution of Guangxi Province, and can use it to study and discover mineral deposits within the territory; in theoretical terms, it can help with the study of ancient geography.
    The institute began the survey work for the geological map of Guangxi Province in 1939, led by Li Siguang (Director of the Institute) Deputy Dean of the Central Research Institute. After that, four or five experts were regularly dispatched for investigation in the spring and autumn of each year. The work was temporarily suspended until 1944 when Japanese imperialism attacked Guangxi and the Kuomintang army retreated. In the spring of 1949, it continued to investigate a part of the unfinished work near Liuzhou. Editing began in November of the same year and has now been completed.
    During the investigation, many mineral deposits were discovered. The Lalang Coalfield is located more than 20 li southwest of Yishan, stretching 70 li from east to west and more than 10 li from north to south. There are two coal seams, one of which is about two meters thick. There is also a coalfield 15 li northeast of Yishan, with two seams, one about two feet thick, and the coal quality is better than the former.

    南京中央研究院地质研究所
    完成广西全省地质图
    将有力帮助西南各省建设
    【南京讯】南京中央研究院地质研究所最近完成了二十五万分之一的广西全省地质图。这是中国目前包括面积最广而且详细的地质图。它的完成对西南各省的建设将有很大帮助。科学家可据以了解广西省的地质构造，地层分布的情形，并可据以研究发现境内矿场；在理论方面，可以帮助古代地理的研究。
    该所进行广西省地质图的调查工作开始于一九三九年，由中央研究院李四光（该所所长）副院长领导，此后每年春、秋两季经常派四、五位专家调查。直到一九四四年日本帝国主义进攻广西，国民党军队撤退，工作暂时停止。一九四九年春又继续调查柳州附近一部分未竟工作。同年十一月开始编辑，目前已编完。
    在调查期间，发现了许多矿藏。宜山西南部距铁道二十余里处有拉浪煤田，东西七十里，南北十余里。煤共有两层，其中一层厚约两公尺。宜山东北十五里也有煤田一处，共两层，一层有两尺左右厚度，煤质较前者为佳。
