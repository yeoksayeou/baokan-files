    [This Newspaper News] The headquarters and political department of a certain division of the Northeast Military Region issued a circular to all subordinate units on December 10th of last year to correct the serious phenomenon of occupying political and cultural study time. The political department of the Northeast Military Region believes that this phenomenon should attract the attention of the entire army and requires all units in the Northeast to conduct an in-depth inspection of this issue, strictly stipulate systems, strengthen the regular education system of the troops, and overcome the disorganized and undisciplined phenomenon in educational work.
    According to a survey by the Guard Division, the tendency of occupying political and cultural study time is prevalent in all subordinate units of the division. Companies "use" political and cultural class time to clean bullets, get haircuts, and conduct individual talks, with military affairs taking up the most time. The first company of the Guard Battalion only had three cultural classes in twenty-four days; During military training, a certain regiment's units squeezed public duties and services into cultural education time; A certain regiment's units averaged thirty delays in political and cultural classes over five months; The guard company of a certain regiment stopped cultural classes for five days to practice aiming.
    The reasons for these phenomena are: First, the leading cadres of various units do not pay enough attention to cultural education, do not handle affairs according to regular systems, lack planning in their work, and fail to allocate time scientifically. Therefore, when training is intensive, they intentionally squeeze public duties and services into cultural education time; Second, some military cadres lack regular training ideas, have the problem of shock training, and are eager to conduct extra military education; In addition, some hold on to the idea of winning awards, such as the company commander of the anti-aircraft artillery company of a certain regiment who said: "Good shooting scores can get a fat pig and a banner, cultural studies can wait!" Third, some political cadres have not really taken responsibility and condone the phenomenon of occupying political and cultural class time. The division headquarters requires all units to: (1) Hope that party committees at all levels recognize the importance of cultural education and ensure that teaching is carried out fully during political and cultural education time. Party member cadres who have neglected cultural studies in the past and in the future should be educated within the party. (2) Correct the erroneous concept of some cadres who emphasize military affairs over culture, cultivate regular training ideas, prevent shock training, and handle affairs in accordance with the system. Within the stipulated time, intensive training and education should be carried out to improve the effect, and the effect should not be improved by extending the time. (3) Adhere to the education system and conduct education according to plan. The division issues a course schedule every month, and the regiment issues one every week, and they must be carried out regularly according to the schedule. When it is necessary to adjust the time, the division approves it for one week, and the regiment approves it for one day, and ensures make-up classes. (4) It is stipulated that the number of class hours is one of the important conditions for evaluating the effectiveness of education in the future, and the regiment and division will award prizes on a regular basis.

    东北军区某师通令所属
    保证按时学文化
    纠正占用政治文化学习时间偏向
    【本报讯】东北军区某师司令部、政治部于去年十二月十日通令所属各部，纠正占用政治、文化学习时间的严重现象；东北军区政治部认为此种现象应引起全军注意，要求东北各部队均对这一问题作深入检查，并严格地规定制度，加强部队正规教育制度，克服在教育工作中的无组织无纪律现象。
    据警卫师调查，该师所属各部普遍有占用政治、文化学习时间的偏向。各连队“利用”政治、文化课时间擦子弹、理发、作个别谈话等，其中尤以军事占时间最多。警卫营一连二十四天只上过三次文化课；某团各部在军事练兵中出公差勤务挤在文化教育时间；某团各部五个月中平均耽误政治、文化课三十次；某团警卫连曾停止文化课五天，以练习瞄准。
    产生这些现象的原因：第一，各部队领导干部对文化教育不够重视，未按正规制度办事，工作缺乏计划，未能科学的支配时间，因此在练兵紧张时，有意的把出公差勤务等挤在文化教育时间；第二，个别军事干部缺乏正规的练兵思想，带有突击练兵的毛病，急于额外进行几次军事教育；此外有的抱着锦标主义，如某团战防炮连连长说：“打靶的成绩好了能得一口肥猪、一面锦旗，文化学习往后点吧！”第三，个别政治干部未真正负起责任，迁就占用政治、文化课时间的现象。师部为此要求各部：（一）希望各级党委认识文化教育的重要性，保证在政治、文化教育时间充分进行教课。对于过去及今后轻视文化学习的党员干部，应在党内进行教育。（二）纠正个别干部重军事轻文化的错误观念，养成正规练兵思想，防止突击练兵，应按制度办事，在规定时间内应紧张的进行练兵教育以提高效果，不以延长时间来提高效果。（三）坚持教育制度，按计划进行教育，师每月，团每周发下课程进度表，必须按进度表正规进行。有必要调剂时间时，一周由师批准，一日由团批准，并保证补课。（四）规定今后考核教育效果，进行课目时数是重要条件之一，由团师按期评奖。
