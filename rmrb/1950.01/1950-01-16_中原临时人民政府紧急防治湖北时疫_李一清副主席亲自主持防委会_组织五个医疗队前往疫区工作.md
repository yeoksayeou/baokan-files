    Central Plain Provisional People's Government Takes Emergency Measures to Prevent and Control Epidemic in Hubei
    Vice Chairman Li Yiqing Personally Presides Over Prevention Committee
    Five Medical Teams Organized to Work in Epidemic Areas

    [By Our Newspaper] A severe epidemic infectious disease broke out in Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, in mid-December of last year. Starting from the border areas of Sui County and Zao Yang, it had spread by January 4th to an area of 400 li, encompassing Hongshan, Gucheng, Yicheng, Nanzhang, and Lengjiaji across the river from Laohekou. More than 400 people have died in Hongshan, Lengjiaji and other places. The incubation period of the disease is only 24 hours, and death occurs within one to two days after onset. Reports suggest it may be epidemic meningitis, although this has not been confirmed. Despite local government efforts to rescue patients, the disease continues to spread. The Central Plain Provisional People's Government has taken emergency prevention measures at the beginning of this month. It was decided that a Central and Southern Epidemic Prevention Committee would be formed, consisting of seven people: Li Yiqing, Vice Chairman of the Central Plain Provisional People's Government; Lin Zhihan, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Health; Pan Zinian, Minister of the Ministry of Education; Zhou Guangtan, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Civil Affairs; Yang Shaoqiao, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Finance; Nie Hongjun, Vice Chairman of Hubei Province; and Zhou Jifang, Deputy Mayor of Wuhan. Vice Chairman Li Yiqing and Deputy Minister Lin Zhihan will serve as the Director and Deputy Director, respectively, to lead the emergency treatment and prevention work in the entire region. In addition, the Hubei Provincial Government, the Wuhan Municipal Government, and the Central Plain Provisional People's Government have formed an epidemic prevention command center and five medical teams. These teams departed between the 5th and 10th to rush to the Xiangyang area to assist in relevant education, prevention, and rescue work. At the same time, a number of experts have been gathered to continue studying and judging the nature of the illness. The Central Plain Provisional People's Government also issued an emergency directive on the 10th, requiring all provinces and cities to vigorously organize rescue treatment or launch epidemic prevention preparations based on their actual conditions, while simultaneously conducting epidemic prevention publicity and education.

    [Another Dispatch] The Wuhan Medical Joint Preparatory Committee convened an emergency meeting of the heads of public and private hospitals in the city on the evening of the 10th. At the meeting, it was decided that an epidemic prevention team of more than 30 people, consisting of doctors, pathology experts, technicians, and nurses from various hospitals, would be organized. Carrying a large number of medicines and medical equipment, they will go to the Ministry of Health of the Central Plain Provisional People's Government on the 11th to assemble and depart for work in the epidemic area.
