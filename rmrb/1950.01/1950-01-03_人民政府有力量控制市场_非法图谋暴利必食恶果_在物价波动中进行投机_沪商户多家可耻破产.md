Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th -- Several merchants who speculated during the price fluctuations from the second half of October to the first half of November have now suffered shameful bankruptcy. Some short-sighted financiers and industrialists in Shanghai, failing to understand that the People's Government has the power to control the market, thought there was an opportunity to exploit when prices rose. They engaged in huge off-book lending or borrowed at high interest rates to snap up goods and hoard them, stirring up trouble in the market in an attempt to obtain illegal exorbitant profits. When the materials dispatched by the People's Government reached the market, stabilizing the excessively rising prices, these speculators suffered irreparable losses, leading to closure and bankruptcy. This fact most powerfully demonstrates that under the governance of the People's Government, engaging in speculation will inevitably lead to bitter consequences. According to investigations, five Shanghai financial firms went bankrupt one after another in the second half of November because they privately set up secret accounts and engaged in huge off-book high-interest lending during price fluctuations, resulting in insufficient funds and inability to replenish exchange deficits. Seven firms were suspended from business due to illegal activities such as establishing fictitious secret accounts, engaging in off-book lending, and misappropriating business funds. Another forty-nine firms were also subjected to warnings, fines, and suspension of check clearing for failing to report some secret accounts within the prescribed time limit and for inaccurate accounting records. On the store front, one cotton cloth store started trading on the 15th of last month and speculated heavily, only to declare bankruptcy on the 25th due to excessive losses. In addition, several silk and satin shops, cotton cloth stores, and Western-style clothing stores were stranded due to massive hoarding leading to tight cash flow. In the industrial sector, many rubber factories, knitting factories, yarn factories, weaving factories, hosiery factories, and others were stranded because they used funds for speculation or borrowed at high interest rates to snap up raw materials and stopped selling products, making them unable to repay principal and interest when prices returned to normal. It is generally estimated that cotton cloth firms lost more than 25.3 billion yuan and cotton yarn firms lost more than 158 billion yuan due to illegal profiteering in this price fluctuation.

    人民政府有力量控制市场
    非法图谋暴利必食恶果
    在物价波动中进行投机
    沪商户多家可耻破产
    【新华社上海二十九日电】在十月下半月至十一月上半月的物价波动中进行投机的商户多家现已遭受可耻的破产。上海某些短视的银钱业者和工商业者不了解人民政府有控制市场的力量，在物价上涨时，以为有机可投，竟进行巨额账外拆放，或以高利借款，抢购物资，囤积居奇，在市场上兴风作浪，图获非法暴利。当人民政府所调度的物资到达市场，而使过分上涨的物价转趋平稳时，这些投机之徒损失不赀，以致倒闭歇业。这一事实最有力地说明，在人民政府的治理下，进行投机勾当，必然会自食恶果。据调查，上海银钱业中因在物价波动时私设暗账，经营账外巨额高利拆放，致使资金亏绌，无法补足交换缺额，在十一月下半月先后宣告倒闭的有五家；因有虚设暗户、经营账外拆放、套用业务资金等违法行为，受暂停营业处分的有七家；另有四十九家亦因有部分暗账未依限呈报，账册记载不实等行为，分别受警告、罚金、停止票据交换等处分。商店方面，有一家棉布号于上月十五日开始交易，大事投机，至二十五日即因亏蚀过巨宣告倒闭；此外因大量囤积致周转不灵宣告搁浅的有绸缎局、棉布庄、西服店等多家。工业方面，因将资金用于投机，或以高利借款抢购原料，停售产品致在物价回平时无力还本付息而搁浅者有橡胶厂、针织厂、纱厂、织造厂、袜厂等多家。一般估计，此次物价波动中棉布行庄因非法牟利而亏蚀二百五十三亿元以上，棉纱商行则达一千五百八十亿元以上。
