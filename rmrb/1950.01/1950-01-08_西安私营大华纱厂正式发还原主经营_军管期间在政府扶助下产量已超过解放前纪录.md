Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 6th: The privately-owned Dahua Textile Factory in Xi'an, which was under the administration of the Xi'an Military Control Commission, has been returned to its parent company for management. The handover ceremony was held on November 27th of last year. Before Xi'an's liberation in May of last year, the factory's person in charge, deceived by the Kuomintang reactionaries' propaganda, absconded with funds and handed the factory over to the Kuomintang government, causing it to suffer damage from bandit gangs. In order to care for the livelihoods of thousands of workers and ensure the continuation of production, the Xi'an Military Control Commission implemented military management over the factory. During the period of military control, the Trade Company solved the factory's difficulties in capital turnover and material purchase and sales through loans, rationed flour, and the supply of raw cotton, coal, and the sale of yarn and cloth. By August of last year, almost all of the factory's 30,000 spindles and 800 looms were operating, and production gradually exceeded the records before the liberation of Xi'an. For example, in the past, each spindle produced 0.8 pounds of yarn every 24 hours, but by October of last year, it had reached 0.79 pounds of yarn every 20 hours. After the parent company sent a new manager back to the factory, the Military Control Commission instructed the military representative and acting factory director to hand over operations to the manager.

    西安私营大华纱厂正式发还原主经营
    军管期间在政府扶助下产量已超过解放前纪录
    【新华社西安六日电】西安军事管制委员会代管的西安私营大华纺织厂，已经发还该厂总公司经营。交接仪式已于去年十一月二十七日举行。去年五月西安解放前，该厂负责人因受国民党反动派欺骗宣传，携款逃走，并将工厂交国民党政府处理，因而遭受胡匪破坏。西安军管会为照顾数千工人生活，并使生产得以继续，乃对该厂实行军事管理。军管期间曾经由贸易公司以贷款和配售面粉及供给原棉、煤炭、销售纱、布等办法解决了该厂资金周转以及购料销货的各种困难。至去年八月，全厂三万枚纱锭、八百台布机已经差不多全部开动，产量亦逐渐超过西安解放前的纪录，如过去每日二十四小时每锭出纱零点八磅，而至去年十月即已达到每日二十小时出纱零点七九磅。及该厂总公司派新经理回厂后，军管会即令军事代表和代理厂长向该经理办理交代。
