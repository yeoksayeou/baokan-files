Production and Disaster Relief Online (1)

Summary of Henan Province's Disaster Relief Plan

(1) Vigorously organize and support the masses in production based on local conditions—this is the primary method:

\t1. Organize wood, iron, rubber-wheeled vehicles, livestock, and manpower to develop transportation, transporting and selling grain, salt, coal, cotton, cloth, and other necessities; mobilize the masses to engage in oil pressing, cotton ginning, silk weaving, silkworm rearing, flour milling, brick firing, sand casting, hat braiding, reed mat weaving, willow basket weaving, medicinal herb digging, charcoal burning, sulfur mining, papermaking, cigarette rolling, etc., and other handicraft and sideline production.

\t2. The bank plans to provide low-interest grain loans of 10 million catties this winter and 12 million catties next spring to support rural production and organize and guide operations, requiring the masses to obtain a profit of 1.5 to 2 times the loan amount. The targets of the loans are poor farmers with labor who can engage in production.

\t3. State-owned and public enterprises should, based on sales and subjective and objective capabilities, purchase as much local produce and handicraft products as possible, organize urban-rural material exchange, open up sales channels, invigorate the economy, and stabilize prices to support mass production and regulate mass food supply, preparing large quantities of grains, bran, oil cakes, and other famine relief foods.

\t4. Our agencies and troops must allocate manpower and livestock to help the masses near their驻地 (first and foremost, the dependents of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers who are poor and lack labor) to carry out spring plowing and other spring plowing preparations.

(2) In cities, it is necessary to rectify the policies on industry and commerce, dispel the concerns of industrialists and merchants, allowing them to operate with peace of mind, and earnestly help relocated factories to start operations and engage in production; organize poor people and unemployed workers for transportation; develop marketable handicrafts based on sales; and continue to organize the making of military shoes according to the prescribed standards.

(3) Practice strict economy and eliminate waste:

\t1. Call on the masses to save food for disaster relief, eat sparingly, make every resource count, and strive for simplicity in weddings and funerals, avoiding extravagance. Collect large quantities of wild vegetables and tree leaves, and plant rapeseed as a substitute food.

\t2. All agencies and troops must be diligent and thrifty, economize on clothing and food, cherish the people's labor, property, and time, and oppose corruption, extravagance, and waste. Each member of the provincial troops and agencies should save one tael of grain per day for the three months of January, February, and March next year, which is expected to save 1.2 million catties as relief grain.

(4) Next spring's projects and construction costs for river dredging, road repair, grain transportation, and construction should be combined with famine relief as much as possible, with a large portion or part of the funds allocated to various regions in a planned manner to provide work as a form of relief. At the same time, some necessary and possible construction projects can be completed in accordance with this year's and next year's budget plans. The provisional numbers are as follows:

\t1. Flood control and river management, providing work as a form of relief: 4 million catties this winter and 15 million catties next spring.

\t2. Building warehouses along the railway line: 17 million catties.

\t3. Building roads: approximately 10 million catties next spring.

\t4. It is estimated that 10,000 catties can be spent on transporting grain and fodder outside the railway line (excluding transportation by train and ship).

\t5. For the province's urban construction expenses next year, 3 million to 5 million catties will be borrowed once next spring.

\t6. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission allocates 4 million catties for dike repairs.

\t7. The Railway Bureau can spend 4 million catties of grain this winter on ballast for the Longhai and Pinghan Railways. (The above figures do not include the purchase of raw materials and are only the parts that can play a role in providing work as a form of relief.)

(5) In areas where the disaster is serious and relief must be provided next spring, a certain amount of relief grain should be distributed in a coordinated plan. The provincial government will allocate 5 million catties, together with 1.2 million catties of saved grain, totaling 6.2 million catties. Starting this winter, these funds should be used to purchase bran, various oil cakes, and coarse grains to expand the effectiveness of relief. The recipients of relief must be poor dependents of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and cadres, as well as truly poor households in difficulty.

(6) According to preliminary reports, the special districts plan to allocate more than 37 million catties of local grain for production and disaster prevention. Continuing to sort and adjust supplies may yield even more. Each special district must also adhere to the above principles of supporting production and providing work as a form of relief (such as river dredging, canal repair, prison repair, and warehouse construction). The portion used for relief should not exceed one-fifth to one-quarter of the grain allocated by the special district.

(7) Utilize social forces for mutual assistance in preparing for disasters:

\t1. Adhere to the principles of reasonableness, legality, borrowing and repayment, self-determined interest rates, and free lending to promote mutual assistance and borrowing among the people, borrowing grain in exchange for labor.

\t2. Each special district can, in non-disaster areas, raise some vegetables, bran, sweet potatoes, and miscellaneous grains on a voluntary donation basis to provide relief to disaster areas.

\t\t\t\tSu County Special District Disaster Relief Measures

1. Immediately provide emergency relief to disaster victims who have run out of food to ensure no one starves to death.

\t(1) Decide to use the 1 million catties of emergency rations previously allocated by the Anhui North Administrative Office and the 5 million catties of wheat bran and bean cake allocated this time as emergency rations.

\t(2) Each county should quickly establish specialized transportation agencies to be responsible for transporting the allocated relief grain back via waterways or railways and organize disaster victims to carry it.

\t(3) Emergency rations should be mainly distributed to disaster victims who have run out of food in severely affected areas. It is necessary to focus on emergency relief and adhere to the principle of prioritizing poor and lower-middle peasants while also providing relief to other classes of households that have run out of food. Each county must organize work teams to conduct in-depth investigations in disaster areas, mobilize the masses to conduct democratic evaluations, and distribute the grain according to different levels. Distribution must be fair and avoid average distribution. It is necessary to prevent unfairness and the embezzlement of funds by some grassroots cadres and individual bad elements.

2. Implement water conservancy projects in advance, implement work-for-relief programs, and strive to prevent disaster victims from blindly fleeing the famine.

\t(1) The Anhui North Administrative Office has allocated 30 million catties of water conservancy grain to support our district's production and self-reliance. In addition to the 4.5 million catties that the People's Bank is loaning, the remaining grain is to be used for work-for-relief programs. This is the main material foundation for our disaster relief efforts. Thirty million catties of water conservancy grain can feed one million people for one month (calculated at one catty per person per day). If we add the grain contributed by areas with good harvests according to reasonable burdens, we can save even more people. Quickly organizing disaster victims for river work is the most effective way to stop blind flight from famine.

\t(2) Strive to complete the Huai River project before the Lunar New Year. For the sake of disaster relief, the Tang River project should also strive to start before the Lunar New Year. The specific measures will be implemented according to the plans of the Construction Section.

\t(3) The Huai River project in the Su County Special District involves a total of 1,736,000 cubic meters of earthwork. The wage grain is 6,076,000 jin. If 50,000 people dig every day, each person digging two cubic meters of earth, it will take 20 days. Each person gets seven jin of grain a day, and self-provided food is two jin. It can support three to four people, and it can support 200,000 disaster victims.

\t(4) In addition to mobilizing disaster victims from Sihong, Huaiyuan, and Wuhe counties to participate in the Huai River project, avoid mobilizing middle peasants and above who can maintain their livelihoods so that disaster victims from other counties can be mobilized to go there. The accommodation, food, and other work for the migrant workers must be carefully arranged. The CPC Su County Prefectural Committee will also send work teams to carry out the work. A command post of the engineering department is organized by the special commissioner's office and the prefectural party committee sending major comrades. Organize the Social Education Corps to strengthen the publicity and education of the river workers.

3. Universally develop sideline production.

\t(1) The task of universally developing sideline production is to enable disaster victims to preserve capital and earn profits in production to achieve self-reliance. According to the different conditions of each place, implement relying on mountains if near mountains, relying on water if near water, and develop various types of sideline production, such as cutting grass, weaving, fishing, digging lotus roots, digging coal, etc. As long as there are production paths, leadership and organization should be carried out, but the main method is oil extraction, because the interest on oil extraction is large, and the supply of raw materials and the sales of finished products are easier to solve. Only earning money will not lose money.

\t(2) The capital and sources of sideline production: 1. The 生救会 (Production and Relief Association) loans 2 million catties of grain. 2. General light-disaster areas can organize people to pool shares, or call on people from all walks of life to donate to support farmers' production. 3. People's Bank lends small loans. 4. After democratic discussion by farmers, part or all of the victory fruits of anti-local bullies can be drawn to be used as production funds.

\t(3) Issues with the products and sales of various sideline productions: ① The government allocates 2 million catties of grain and 300 million yuan to organize the purchase of local products by a local products purchasing company. ② To ensure the sales of cooperative products of disaster victims in severely affected areas and obtain a certain profit, local trading companies and cooperatives should purchase at market prices and supply raw materials to disaster victims' cooperatives at low prices. ③ Self-organized selling. ④ Attracting customers and selling locally.

\t(4) In the development of sideline production, each region must send capable cadres to carry out organizational leadership work, and must select loyal, reliable, and selfless farmers to take control to achieve the goal of production and self-reliance, and strictly prevent bad elements from embezzling.

\t(5) The basic principles of various sideline production cooperatives for disaster victims are: public assistance and private operation, voluntary combination, and leadership of the 生救会 (Production and Relief Association). We cannot "run disaster relief by officials" and cultivate the disaster victims' psychology of simply relying on the government. In order to expand capital and expand production, the 2 million catties of loan grain from the 生救会 (Production and Relief Association) are regarded as the shares of the disaster victims; farmers can also invest shares and share dividends according to shares. Sideline production tools should use existing tools. All tools can be counted as shares. Tools cannot be forcibly requisitioned or re-added, otherwise the funds will shrink and be unable to turn over, affecting production.

\t(6) How to truly distribute loans to disaster victims and engage in production for self-rescue. This is a problem that needs to be paid attention to urgently. In places where the masses have been mobilized, the farmers’ associations and the CPC party branches discuss and guarantee it. In places where the masses have not been mobilized, it is distributed through meetings of township peasant representatives.

4. Organize transportation and sales, and purchase local products.

\t(1) Tasks of transportation, sales and purchase of local products: ① Focus on lending and planned support for various production cooperatives and individual sideline production operations in disaster areas. ② Purchase and exchange the finished products of sideline production and local raw materials of the disaster-stricken masses, such as reeds and fish from Hongze Lake. ③ Master the market and organize the transportation, sales and regulation of salt, industrial products and grain.

\t(2) Establish specialized local product purchase, transportation, and sales institutions at all levels to conduct planned production, transportation, and sales leadership. The Su County Special Zone established a Production and Transportation Company, composed of cadres drawn from the Special Zone Production and Relief Association and various agencies; the county established a local product transportation and sales cooperative, based on personnel from the County Production and Relief Association and public-owned distilleries. The special zone company and the county cooperative mainly have a business guidance relationship, and the specific leadership is under the responsibility of each county. The special zone company and the county cooperative each have a general manager and deputy general manager, with accounting, sales, transportation, and storage departments, each with one director and one deputy director, and several salesmen and clerks. Governments and CPC party committees at all levels must transfer politically strong cadres to carry out this work.

\t(3) Immediately rush to repair the highway bridges and shipping lanes of the transportation trunk lines, and strengthen the anti-banditry and winter defense work along the lines to facilitate water and land transportation; the main lines should be equipped with telephones with neighboring areas as much as possible to grasp market information. The roads to be repaired by the end of December are the Su (County) Meng (City) line, the Yong (City) Su (County) line, the Xu (Zhou) Xiao (County) Yong (City) line, the Qing (Yang) Si (County) Ling (Bi) Su (County) line, etc.

\t(4) Establish a disaster relief and transportation accommodation station for disaster victims every thirty miles on the main transportation lines, and the government will lend grain to reliable farmers to open public restaurants to provide disaster victims with low-priced food and accommodation.

\t(5) Mobilizing disaster victims for transportation and sales is a more cumbersome organizational task. All regions must organize disaster victims well, establish leadership institutions, and send cadres to take personal control. It can be divided into small teams (ten carts), platoons (thirty carts), and companies (one hundred carts). The captains and instructors at all levels are served by township cadres who are detached from production, and the remaining cadres are elected by the farmers' association. Organizational education work should be strengthened.

5. Check wheat and vegetable planting work.

The task of wheat planting in each place has generally been completed by 60%, but in general, there are still many waterlogged lands that have not been planted in severely affected areas. A good inspection should be done and it must be planted. It is required that the water-disaster area reach 75% to 80%. If the wheat seeds are difficult to solve, the government can still lend a part. Next spring, we will also launch the planting of vegetable seeds. In addition to the government lending to severely affected areas, other general areas will solve it by themselves.

6. Protect livestock.

\t(1) It is recommended that the higher-level government lend out some grass. (2) Organize group feeding. (3) Organize livestock to engage in transportation. Implement people raising livestock and livestock raising people. (4) It is strictly forbidden to slaughter cattle.

    生产救灾线上（一）
    河南渡荒方案摘要
    （一）根据各地具体情况，大力组织并扶植群众进行生产——这是主要的办法：
    １、组织木、铁、胶轮车辆、牲口与人力，发展运输，运销粮盐、煤、棉、纱布与其他必需品；发动群众进行榨油、轧花、织绸、养蚕、磨粉、烧窑、翻砂、卡帽辫、织蒲席、编柳筐、挖药材、烧木炭、开硫磺矿、造纸、卷烟……等手工业与副业生产。
    ２、银行计划今冬低利贷粮一千万斤，明春低利贷粮一千二百万斤，扶植农村生产并组织指导经营，要求群众获得一倍半至二倍之利润。贷放对象为有劳力能生产之贫苦农民。
    ３、国营公营企业根据销路与主客观力量，尽量收购土产与手工业产品，组织城乡物资交流，打开销路，活跃经济，稳定物价，以扶植群众生产，并调剂群众食粮，准备大批谷、糠、油饼等渡荒食品。
    ４、我机关部队所在地，必须抽出人力、畜力，帮助驻地附近群众（首先是贫苦无劳力的烈、军、工属），进行春耕与其他春耕准备工作。
    （二）在城市要端正工商业政策，解除工商业者的顾虑，使其放心经营，并切实帮助内迁工厂开工，进行生产，组织贫苦人民与失业工人运输，根据销路发展有出路的手工业，并按照规定标准，继续组织作军鞋。
    （三）厉行节约，杜绝浪费：
    １、号召群众节约渡荒，省吃俭用，细水长流，婚丧大事亦力求简朴不可铺张，大量采集野菜树叶，种植油菜，作为代食品。
    ２、所有机关部队，必须艰苦朴素，节衣缩食，爱惜民力、民财、民时，反对贪污腐化铺张浪费，全省部队机关于明年一、二、三三个月内，每人每日节约一两粮，预计可省百二十万斤，作为赈粮。
    （四）明春挖河、修路、运粮、建筑等事业与建设费用，尽可能的结合救荒，拿出大部或一部，有计划的分配各地，以工代赈，同时又可按照今年及明年度预算计划，完成一些必要与可能的建设，数目暂定如下：
    １、防洪治河，以工代赈、今冬四百万斤，明春一千五百万斤。
    ２、铁路沿线，建设仓库一千七百万斤。
    ３、修筑公路，明春约一千万斤。
    ４、铁路线以外调运粮秣估计可开支一万斤（火车船只运输不在内）。
    ５、明年全省全年城市土木修建费，明春一次借用三百万至五百万斤。
    ６、黄河修堤黄委会拨粮四百万斤。
    ７、陇平两铁路石子，铁路局今冬可开支粮四百万斤。（以上数字，不包括原料购买，系能起代赈作用部分。）
    （五）在灾情严重明春必须救济的地区，统盘计划，发放一定数的赈粮，省府拨粮五百万斤连同节约粮一百二十万斤，共六百二十万斤，应于今冬即开始换购谷糠、各种油饼及粗杂粮食，扩大救济效力；救济对象必须是贫苦无劳力的烈、军、干属与真正贫苦的困难户。
    （六）各专区由地方粮内拟拨用于生产防荒者，据初步报告约三千七百余万斤，继续清理调剂，可能更多，各专区亦必须本以上方针以扶助生产与以工代赈（如挖河、修渠、修监狱、仓库）为主，用于救济部分，不得超过该专区拨粮五分之一至四分之一。
    （七）运用社会力量，互助备荒：
    １、本合理合法，有借有还，利率自订，自由借贷原则，发扬民间的互助互借，借粮换工。
    ２、各专区在非灾地区、可本自由捐献原则，募集些菜蔬、谷糠、红薯、杂粮等救济食品，对灾区进行救济。
            宿县专区救灾办法
    一、立即急救断炊之灾民，争取不饿死人
    （一）决定以皖北行署前次拨放之一百万斤急救口粮及此次拨来之五百万斤麦麸豆饼为急救口粮。
    （二）各县应迅速建立专门运输机构，负责将拨给的救济粮经水路或铁路运回，并组织灾民搬运。
    （三）急救口粮主要发给重灾区断炊之灾民，应掌握救急，以贫雇中农为主的原则，同时也要救济其他阶层的断炊户，各县均要组织工作队，到灾区进行深入调查，发动群众民主评议，分成等级发放，不得平均发放；要防止不公和某些基层干部及个别坏分子从中贪污。
    二、提早执行兴修水利计划，实行以工代赈，争取灾民不盲目逃荒
    （一）皖北行署为了支持本分区的生产自救，拨了水利粮三千万斤，内中除了人民银行四百五十万斤是贷粮外，其余粮食均决定以工代赈，这是我们救灾的主要物质基础，三千万斤水利粮就能养活一百万人一个月（每人每天以一斤计算），如果加上收成好的地方按合理负担出方土的话，则能救活更多的人。迅速组织灾民上河工，是停止盲目逃荒的最有效的办法。
    （二）夏历年前争取完成淮河工程；为了救灾，唐河年前亦要争取动工，各县内河要分别开工。具体办法按建设科计划执行。
    （三）淮河工程在宿县分区的共一百七十三万六千方土，工资粮六百○七万六千市斤，如按每天五万人挖，每人挖两方土，共须时间二十天，每人一天七斤粮，自食二斤，可养活三人至四人，就可养活二十万灾民。
    （四）参加修淮工程的民工，除由泗洪、怀远、五河三县动员灾民外，不动员一般能维持生活的中农以上成份上工，以便动员其他各县灾民前往。对民工住宿粮草等项工作，必须要周密布置，中共宿县地委会亦派出工作队前往进行工作；由专署、地委派出主要同志组织工程处指挥部。组织社教团，加强对河工的宣传教育。
     三、普遍发展副业生产
    （一）普遍开展副业生产，其任务是在使灾民在生产中能保本吃利，达到自救的目的。各地应根据各地不同的条件，实行靠山吃山、靠水吃水，发展各种各样的副业生产，如砍草、编织、捕鱼、挖藕、挖煤等，只要有生产的路都领导组织进行，但其中主要的办法是打油，因为打油利息大，原料的供给，成品的销售较易解决，只有赚钱不会亏本。
    （二）副业生产的资本和来源：一、生救会贷给二百万斤粮食。二、一般轻灾区可组织人民集股，或号召社会人士捐助，支持农民生产。三、人民银行贷放小本借款。四、反恶霸的胜利果实，经农民民主讨论，可抽出一部或全部做生产基金。
    （三）各种副业生产成品和销路问题：①政府拨出二百万斤粮食和三亿人民币，组织土产收购公司收购。②为保证重灾区灾民合作社生产成品的销售并获得一定利润，各地贸易公司及合作社应按市价收购，并以原料低价供给灾民合作社。③自行组织贩卖。④招揽主顾，就地销售。
    （四）在发展副业生产中，各地要派得力的干部进行组织领导工作，必须选出忠实可靠、大公无私的农民来掌握，才能达到生产自救的目的，严防坏分子从中贪污。
    （五）灾民各种副业生产合作社的基本方针是：公助民办，自愿结合，生救会领导。不能“官办救灾”，养成灾民单纯依赖政府心理。为了扩大资本，扩大生产，生救会之二百万斤贷粮算作灾民的股金；农民亦可入股，按股分红。副业生产工具应利用现有工具，各种工具都可算股，不能强迫征用或重新添置工具，否则资金缩小无力周转，影响生产。
    （六）如何将贷款真正发到灾民手里，并从事生产自救。这是一个亟须重视的问题，在群众已发动地方通过农会、中共党支部讨论和保证。在群众未发动地方，通过乡农民代表会议发放。
    四、组织运销，收购土产
    （一）运销收购土产的任务：①重点贷放，有计划的扶植灾区的各种生产合作社及个体经营的副业生产。②收购兑换灾区群众之副业生产成品及土产原料，如洪泽湖的苇子、鱼等。③掌握市场，组织食盐、工业品、粮食的运销与调剂。
    （二）建立各级专门的土产收购运销机构，有计划的开展生产运销领导工作。宿县专区成立生产运销公司，由专区生救会和各机关抽调干部组成；县成立土产运销合作社，以县生救会和公营槽坊人员作基础组成。分区公司与县合作社主要是业务指导关系，具体领导均归各县负责。专区公司与县合作社分设正副经理，下分会计、营业、运输、保管各部，各部设主任一人和副主任一人，营业员、办事员若干人。各级政府、中共党委必须抽调政治上坚强的干部来进行这一工作。
    （三）立即赶修运输干线的公路桥梁、航运线，加强沿线之剿匪及冬防工作，便利水陆运输；主要干线尽可能与邻区架设电话，以掌握市场商情。十二月底要修好的公路为宿（县）蒙（城）线、永（城）宿（县）线、徐（州）萧（县）永（城）线、青（阳）泗（县）灵（璧）宿（县）线等。
    （四）主要运输干线每隔三十里建立一灾民运销食宿站，由政府借粮给可靠的农民开办大众饭店，供给灾民贱价食物及住宿。
    （五）发动灾民运销是一个较繁重的组织工作，各地必须将灾民组织好，建立领导机构，派干部亲自掌握。可分小队（十辆小车）、分队（三十辆车）、中队（一百辆），各级队长、指导员，由脱离生产的乡干担任，其余干部由农会选出担任之，应加以组织教育工作。
    五、检查种麦和种菜工作
    各地种麦任务一般均已完成百分之六十，但一般重灾区现在未种的出水待种地仍不少，应很好检查，一定要把它种下，要求水灾区达到百分之七十五到百分之八十。麦种困难无法解决者，政府仍可贷给一部。明春还要发动种菜籽，菜种除政府贷放给重灾区外，其余一般地区自行解决。
    六、保护牲畜
    （一）建议上级政府贷出一部草。（二）组织伙养。（三）组织牲口从事运输。实行人养牲口，牲口养人。（四）严禁宰杀耕牛。
