Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: North China is actively preparing for Spring Festival cultural and entertainment activities. The content of activities in various places mainly focuses on mobilizing the launch of this year's production movement. In terms of methods, attention is paid to uniting old artists and mobilizing the masses to participate together. Various special districts and counties in Hebei Province have successively held symposiums with literary and art cadres and folk artists to discuss the methods of implementation. Sixteen counties, including Cangxian and Boye, proposed that each county should produce three to five better literary and artistic works before the Spring Festival, and use old forms that are popular and easy for the masses to understand, such as land boats, stilts, carts, and clappers, to promote new content of developing production and loving the motherland. In the Tianjin Special District, it was decided to write 69 new dramas and 45 stories for drum and clapper performances, and to print 50 sets of comic strips such as "Production for Self-Salvation" and "Cooperation and Mutual Assistance." Shulu has already created 43 operas such as "Sisters Comforting the Troops" and "Planting Cotton." Feixiang has revised 200 old operas and drum lyrics. In addition to restoring 27 village opera troupes, Boye has also organized 13 new opera troupes. The Suiyuan Provincial Government instructed governments, organizations, and schools at all levels to organize preparatory committees to prepare for Spring Festival cultural and entertainment activities. The Provincial Department of Culture and Education held a Spring Festival submission campaign and should collect various folk art works, modify and enrich them, and then promote them. The Chahar Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles has issued instructions requiring local federations of literary and art circles to organize and lead old artists such as village opera troupes, old opera troupes, shadow plays, drum performances, and puppet shows during the Spring Festival. If necessary, short-term training classes can also be held to enable them to widely publicize new content beneficial to the masses, and emphasize helping workers and peasants collectively create new literary and artistic works and activities; various places can also launch creation competitions and rewards as appropriate. In addition, various provinces are rushing to print a large number of New Year pictures. The Shijiazhuang Dazhong Fine Arts Society has printed 18 kinds of color paintings with content such as "Sideline Production," "Comforting the Troops," and "Learning Culture." The Shanxi Provincial Artists Association has printed 20 kinds of New Year pictures such as "Field Seed Selection," "Li Shunda's Family," and "Mutual Aid in Labor Exchange."
