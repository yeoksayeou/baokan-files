Literary Snippets

    The Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Music Committee plans to publish a regular, but not fixed-periodical, song collection. In addition to mainly publishing popular songs, it will also include short essays, experience introductions, and music movement communications. The Northeast Music Series will also be published. The committee will also launch "Northeast Songs" at the end of February.

    The "People's Art," sponsored by the National Artists Association, will be published soon. The content of the inaugural issue includes the National Artists Association Standing Committee's call to art workers in various regions to "Strive to Express New China," as well as more than 30 articles by Cai Ruohong, Tang Zhenfeng, Gan Yu, Chen Boping, Li Keran, Ye Qianyu, and Li Qun. In addition, this issue will feature art movement reports, art activities, and eight pages with thirteen paintings (not including illustrations, including cartoons, drawings, oil paintings, and New Year pictures).
