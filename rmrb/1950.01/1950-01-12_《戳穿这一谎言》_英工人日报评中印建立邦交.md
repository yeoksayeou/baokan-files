Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 11th: The London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on December 31st of last year entitled "Exposing This Lie" regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations between India and the People's Republic of China. It stated: "After India recognizes the People's Republic of China, Britain and most other dominions will follow suit. India's decision was prompted by pressure from the country's people. Continuing to support Chiang Kai-shek's obviously puppet regime would be an openly obsequious act of flattery towards imperialism, which would enrage the broad masses of the Indian people.

However, it cannot be assumed that India's recognition of China, or Britain and its dominions' subsequent recognition of China, signifies the imminent beginning of a period of good relations, including expanded trade. On the contrary, the Colombo Conference will soon discuss the imperialist offensive against the national liberation struggles in Asia. Before truly peaceful relations can be established, further strong struggles are needed on the part of the peace forces in Britain.

At the same time, the British people can see very clearly how the United States is now openly leading the world's war camp. Although Chiang Kai-shek receives no support from the people in China whatsoever, the United States continues to arm his troops in Taiwan, giving him large numbers of tanks and planes. Their idea is that Taiwan must be maintained as a poisonous thorn in the side of the new China. They will organize a so-called blockade from Taiwan, coupled with the bombing of major cities on the mainland. Even the most brazen liars serving the State Department cannot portray Chiang Kai-shek, who has been abandoned by the Chinese people, as anything better than a mercenary subsidized by the United States. The State Department does not want Asia to settle down and attain peace. Its next step will be to arm Japan against China.

Despite these abominable facts, the Conservative Party and right-wing Labour leaders will undoubtedly continue to portray this greedy imperialist nation as a sincere dove of peace. But this lie is becoming increasingly untenable. Crushing the war policy based on this lie and developing the peace movement to the point of thoroughly exposing this lie is essential for the survival of the British people."

    《戳穿这一谎言》
    英工人日报评中印建立邦交
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】伦敦工人日报于去年十二月三十一日以《戳穿这一谎言》为题，对印度与中华人民共和国建立外交关系一事，发表社论称：“在印度承认中华人民共和国之后，英国和其他大多数自治领将随之承认。印度的决定是由于该国人民的压力所促成。继续支持蒋介石的明显的傀儡政权将是一种公开奉承帝国主义的奴性行动，是会激怒印度的广大人民群众的。
    但是，并不能因此认为：印度的承认中国，或者是在这以后英国及其自治领的承认中国，意味着行将开始一个包括扩大贸易在内的良好关系时期。相反的，科伦坡会议即将讨论帝国主义对亚洲民族解放斗争的进攻。在真正和平的关系建立之前，英国和平力量方面还需要作进一步的强有力的斗争。
    同时，英国人民可以极清楚地看到，美国现在正如何在公开领导着世界的战争阵营。尽管蒋介石在中国丝毫得不到人民的支持，然而美国却仍然继续武装他在台湾的军队，给他大量的坦克和飞机。他们的想法是台湾必须被保持为在新中国侧面的一个毒刺。他们将从台湾组织所谓封锁，再配合以对大陆上各大城市的轰炸。即使是为国务院效劳的最厚颜的说谎者，也不能把已为中国人民唾弃了的蒋介石打扮得比美国津贴的雇佣兵好一些。国务院不愿亚洲安定下来得到和平。它的下一步骤将是武装日本反对中国。
    尽管有这可恶的事实，保守党和右翼工党领袖无疑将继续把这一贪婪的帝国主义国家，说成是真诚的和平之鸽。但是，这一谎话正越来越捉襟见肘了。粉碎以这一谎言为基础的战争政策，并将和平运动发展到彻底揭穿这一谎言的程度，这对英国人民的生存是必要的。”
