Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 22nd:

    The Ministry of Railways has obtained approval from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Executive Yuan to adjust the passenger and freight rates for railways in the North and South, starting January 24th. After the adjustment, the basic freight rate will increase by 25% compared to the rate announced on December 6th of last year. The freight class and the diminishing rate with distance will remain the same. The basic passenger fare rate will be changed from the original 56 yuan per kilometer to 75 yuan for railways in the North, and from the original 70 yuan per kilometer to 90 yuan for railways in the South. For example, the adjusted price of a third-class ticket from Beijing to Tianjin will be 10,500 yuan, and the price of a third-class ticket from Beijing to Shanghai will be 100,850 yuan. The rates for luggage and parcel transportation, as well as passenger surcharges (excluding loading and unloading fees), will all increase by 25% based on the current rates. The express train fee, due to the increased number of express trains, will change the original 200 kilometers per section to 100 kilometers per section, to reduce the burden of express train fees for short-distance passengers who travel less than 200 kilometers.

    铁路客货运价明起调整
    【新华社北京二十二日电】铁道部业经呈准中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会，自一月二十四日起，调整北方、南方铁路客货运价。调整后，货运基本运价率较去年十二月六日公布的运价率增加百分之二十五，货等及递远递减办法仍照旧。客运基本运价率，北方铁路原每公里五十六元，改为七十五元，南方铁路原每公里七十元，改为九十元。如自北京至天津三等客票价调整后为一万零五百元，自北京至上海三等票价为十万零八千五百元。行李包裹运价率及客运杂费（装卸费除外）都按现行运价率增加百分之二十五。快车费则因快车次数增多，为照顾短途旅客起见，将原定二百公里为一区段，改为一百公里为一区段，使旅行不足二百公里的旅客快车费负担减轻。
