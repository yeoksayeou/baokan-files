Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th: According to TASS, the newspaper *Izvestia* recently pointed out in an international commentary: The greater the threat of American imperialism to the peaceful existence of the people, the more active and organized the ranks of peace advocates become, the more consolidated their unity in the struggle against the aggressive camp, and the closer their unity around the Soviet Union, the banner of world peace.

*Izvestia* wrote: The plans of the American ambitious to dominate the world are becoming increasingly clear to the people of the world. In the American budget for the 1951 fiscal year, 71 percent of all expenditures are used to prepare for war.

*Izvestia* emphasized: Although aggressors represent all dangers, they are far from as powerful as they want to appear; the current peace movement has confidence in its ability to contain aggressors. This is one of the most prominent characteristics of the current peace movement, which has nothing in common with impotent appeasement. In France, liaison committees for the defense of peace are being established in various cities and enterprises. The working people of France are fighting to stop the war in Vietnam, to ban the atomic bomb, to reduce armaments, and to oppose all kinds of adventurous schemes to prepare for a new war. Similar movements in response to the call of the World Peace Congress have been launched in several other countries. The World Federation of Trade Unions actively supports this call. The Soviet Union's proposal at the Fourth United Nations General Assembly to condemn preparations for a new war, to ban atomic weapons, and to conclude a five-power pact to strengthen peace has been welcomed by hundreds of millions of people around the world. This proposal has become a program of action for the people of the world.

    紧密团结在和平旗手苏联周围
    世界和平阵线更加巩固
    【新华社北京十八日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报顷在国际述评中指出：美帝国主义对人民的和平生存的威胁愈大，则和平拥护者的队伍就愈加积极而且有组织，他们反对侵略阵营的斗争的团结就愈巩固，他们在世界和平的旗手——苏联周围的团结就愈紧密。
    消息报写道：美国野心家称霸世界的计划愈来愈明显地暴露在全世界人民的面前，在美国一九五一会计年度的预算中，全部支出的百分之七十一是用于准备战争的。
    消息报着重指出：侵略者虽然代表着一切危险，可是它们远不如它们所想要表现的那样强大；当前的和平运动，对遏制侵略者的能力具有信心。这就是与无能的绥靖主义毫无共同之处的当前和平运动的最显著的特点之一。在法国，各城镇及各企业正在成立拥护和平联络委员会。法国的劳动人民正在为停止越南战争而斗争，为禁止原子弹、裁减军备和反对准备新战争的种种冒险勾当而斗争。在其他若干国家里，也已发动了类似的响应世界和平大会号召的运动。世界工联积极支持这个号召。苏联在联合国第四届大会上提出的关于谴责新战争准备、禁用原子武器、缔结加强和平五国公约的提案，已受到全世界亿万人民的欢迎。这个提案已成为世界人民的行动纲领。
