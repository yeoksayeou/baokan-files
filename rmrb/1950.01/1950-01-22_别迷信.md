　　Don't Be Superstitious
　　Jingyun Dagu (Peking Ballad Drum)
　　Lao She's poem: Heaven and hell are nonsense,
　　Where are the gods and where are the Buddhas?
　　Burning incense and making offerings is a waste of effort;
　　You lose money and still have to kowtow.
　　Tune the strings, busy beating the drum, snap the clapper, and sing a section on breaking superstition, not worshipping gods and Buddhas, let alone ghosts and demons!
　　In western Beijing, there lived a Wang the Second,
　　His home was in the Lion's Den of the Western Hills.
　　He had seventy mu of good land,
　　Farming it himself, he had horses and carts;
　　Half orchard, half field,
　　He had no worries about food or drink.
　　He married Zhang and had sons and daughters,
　　A family of four, living happily.
　　Wang the Second was good-natured from birth,
　　His words were sweet and amiable;
　　He didn't gamble or drink,
　　Hoeing the fields while singing songs.
　　Wang the Second had one fault, though,
　　Stubbornly believing in gods and Buddhas.
　　He burned incense diligently morning and night,
　　Kowtowing to the mountain god, the earth god, and the goddess of fertility.
　　One day his wife Zhang fell violently ill,
　　The whole family anxiously wrung their hands and wept.
　t go to see a doctor or buy medicine,
　　He only went to invite the incense-reading Li the Fourth Old Woman.
　　This old woman put on a brand new blue dress,
　　Pomegranate flowers, red flowers, green leaves, stuck in the back of her head.
　　Riding a donkey up the mountain,
　　A little servant shouted "De Ta O He!" (Note: De is pronounced DER)
　　As soon as it was said, it was done,
　　She arrived at the Lion's Den.
　　This is why three aunts and six grannies should not be associated with, snap the clapper, once they arrive, they create trouble, spread rumors and confuse the public, good fortune is rare, misfortune is certain!
　　Entering the door, Li the Fourth Old Woman wanted money and wine,
　　And a big table of good food and dishes.
　　After she had her fill of wine and food, she got on the kang,
　　Wang the Second burned incense and kowtowed repeatedly.
　　The old woman opened her mouth wide to yawn,
　　Shrugging her shoulders and pretending to shiver,
　　Acting crazy, her eyes rolling upwards,
　　Tears streaming, snot flowing like a river. (Note: Sa is pronounced in the first tone)
　　After making a fuss for a long time, she opened her mouth,
　　In an old and affected voice, not like an old woman at all.
　　She said: I am the Marshal Tianpeng, Zhu Bajie,
　　With a fat head, big ears, and a mouth half a foot long;
　　I ride the black wind, patrolling the mountains and playing in the water,
　　Arriving at the Lion's Den in the Western Hills;
　　In front of the mountain, behind the mountain, to the left of the mountain, to the right of the mountain, I have seen everything,
　　There are so many demons and monsters:
　　There is a nine-tailed white fox, a red-eyed rabbit,
　　Turning into spirits and causing trouble, and a thousand-year-old camel!
　　Your wife is not sick at all,
　　It's all because she offended the demons and was possessed.
　　Shouting "My god is leaving!",
　　The old woman foamed at the mouth, stammering and stuttering.
　　Wang the Second's hands were ice-cold, sweating profusely,
　　Hastily reporting the divine words in detail.
　　After listening, the witch said:
　　First, teach the patient to drink the ash and flour.
　　She also said, hurry to the San Guan Temple,
　　Invite a few Taoist priests to catch the demons.
　　Wang the Second didn't delay upon hearing this,
　　Hurriedly running down the hillside.
　　Li the Fourth Old Woman and the Taoist priests were two peas in a pod,
　　Colluding inside and out, cheating him, a country bumpkin.
　　The Taoist priests demanded seven dan of grain, (Note: Dan is pronounced like "dan" - referring to the measure of weight)
　　Secondly, they wanted high quality lamp oil, incense, and candles, and a lot of it;
　　Thirdly, they wanted three big vegetarian meals a day,
　　Preferably chicken, duck, fish, and meat, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian!
　　The Taoist priests were originally parasites,
　　Neither producing nor working;
　　Grabbing a sucker and eating their fill,
　　They can't catch demons, but they sure know how to catch people!
　　Wang the Second nodded and agreed repeatedly,
　　Pawning the house and selling the land to save his wife.
　　Pity him, though he had a good heart,
　　His ignorance caused a complete disaster!
　　He didn't think about how a fox could have nine tails,
　　He didn't think about where a thousand-year-old camel could be found,
　　He didn't think that Taoist priests and witches were all money-grabbing ghosts,
　　He didn't think how wooden puppets and clay figures could drink wine and eat steamed buns.
　　He had a brain but he didn't use it to think, snap the clapper, seeing ghosts in broad daylight, he himself was truly possessed.
　　Five Taoist priests arrived together,
　　Before catching demons, they drank wine first.
	　　Up the clapper. There was one with a sallow complexion, thin and listless,
　　But secretly had three concubines.
　　There was one with a fat head, big ears, and a fair complexion,
　　Only knowing how to eat, sleep, and drink well.
　　There was one with three inches of ash on his face,
　　Only able to subdue demons after smoking enough opium.
　　Those two younger ones were even worse,
　　Using "Hademens" as "anti-aircraft guns," smoking a lot of white powder.
　　The five of them ate and drank their fill and took their seats,
　　Beating their instruments, clanging and banging to catch demons.
　　First they invited the lame Li, limping and hobbling,
　　Second they invited the Thunder God Grandmother and the Wind Hag,
　　Third they invited Huang Tianba,
　　Before they even invited him, a storm arose.
　　Only hearing a commotion in the sickroom,
　　Children crying for their mother, adults shouting for their wives.
　　Wang's wife Zhang's illness worsened,
　　Without taking medicine, only drinking ash water;
　　Ash doesn't cure illness,
　　Nor does it help to sleep, drums and gongs being beaten in the courtyard;
　　Therefore, her illness worsened, her spirit weakened, and she breathed her last,
　　She died, without even saying a word!
　　This drove Wang the Second crazy,
　　Stomping his feet and beating his chest helplessly.
　　Crying out for his wife, calling out for his young children,
　　Who will we tell our joys and sorrows to from now on!
　　Grabbing the pitchforks and brooms, he ran outside, (Note: Sao is pronounced in the fourth tone)
　　To beat those deceitful Taoist priests and witches.
　　The Taoist priests had already slipped away,
　　Stealing two baskets of steamed buns;
　　The witch Li the Fourth had also disappeared,
　　Going to Zhangjia Village and Lijia Shop to spout nonsense and tell lies.
　　Helplessly putting down the pitchfork, hugging his young children,
　　Wang the Second's face was full of hot tears, his whole body shivering.
　　A thousand times wrong, ten thousand times wrong,
　　He shouldn't have believed in demons and gods.
　　Of all things, humans are the most intelligent,
　　How can you kowtow to clay figures and wooden puppets?
　　It's reasonable for those who work to eat,
　　Monks and Taoists shouldn't chant scriptures, they should work.
　　Wang the Second's family was ruined, a disaster of his own making,
　　Who told him not to use his brain and blindly believe in demons!
　　This time, breaking superstition is truly important,
　　All because, everything is reasonable, everyone produces, workers and peasants are happy, only then can we build a new China!

### 别迷信
老舍

专栏：

    别迷信
    京津大鼓
    老舍诗篇天堂地狱是胡说，
    哪有神仙哪有佛？
    烧香上供白费事；
    赔钱还要把头磕。
    调好丝弦忙打鼓，摔板唱一段破除迷信，不拜神佛，何况那鬼怪妖魔！
    在京西有一位王老二，
    家住西山狮子窝。
    他有良田七十亩，
    自耕自种，有马又有车；
    果园一半田一半，
    不愁吃来不愁喝。
    娶妻张氏生儿又养女，
    一家子四口儿好快活。
    王老二生来的性情好，
    说话儿甜甘又随和；
    他不赌钱来不喝酒，
    一边耪地一边唱歌。
    王老二可有一点毛病，
    心中顽固信神又信佛。
    早晚烧香不怠慢，
    对着那山神爷，土地爷，子孙娘娘，把头磕。
    有一天他妻张氏得了暴病，
    急得全家哭哭啼啼把手搓。
    他不去请医不去买药，
    单去请瞧香的李四婆。
    这婆娘穿上头蓝的新大褂，
    石榴花，红花绿叶，插在那后脑壳。
    骑着毛驴把山上，
    小僮儿喊着“得嗒哦喝”（注：得读如ＤＥＲ）
    说时迟来那时快，
    一来来到狮子窝。
    这才是三姑六婆休来往，摔板她们一来到哇，无事生非，谣言惑众，吉少凶必多！
    进门来李四婆要钱又要酒，
    还要那好菜好饭一大桌。
    酒足饭饱她才上了炕，
    王老二烧香连把头磕。
    那婆娘张开大嘴打哈欠，
    端着肩膀假哆嗦，
    装疯卖傻，眼珠儿翻上去，
    眼泪扑撒鼻涕过了河。（注：撒读第一声）
    闹哄了半天她才开了口，
    老声老气不像个老婆婆。
    她说道：我乃天蓬元帅猪八戒，
    肥头大耳嘴长半尺多；
    我架着黑风巡山又玩水，
    来到西山狮子窝；
    山前山后，山左山右，我都看到，
    妖魔鬼怪可真多：
    这里有九尾白狐，红眼的兔，
    成精作怪，还有个千年的老骆驼！
    你妻本来没有病，
    都只为冲撞了妖精中了魔。
    高叫一声“吾神去也”，
    老婆娘口吐白沫，愣愣磕磕。
    王老二两手冰凉出盗汗，
    忙把神言仔细说。
    妖婆听罢开言道：
    先教病人把香灰面儿喝。
    她又说，赶快去到三官庙，
    请几位道士把妖捉。
    王老二闻言不怠慢，
    急急忙忙下山坡。
    李四婆和道士本是一条腿，
    里钩外连，欺负他乡下脑壳。
    道士们一要七石谷，（注：石读如蛋）
    二要灯油香蜡又好又得多；
    三要素斋一天三大顿，
    最好是鸡鸭鱼肉荤素两吃着！
    道士们本来是寄生物，
    一不生产二不作活；
    抓住个冤大头死吃一口，
    不会捉妖可真会把人捉！
    王老二点头连答应，
    典房卖地也得救老婆。
    可怜他虽有个好心眼，
    无知无识可就砸了锅！
    他不想狐狸怎生了九条尾，
    他不想哪会有千年老骆驼，
    他不想道士巫婆全是骗钱的鬼，
    他不想木偶泥胎怎会喝酒吃饽饽。
    空长着脑子他不会思想，摔板白天见鬼，他自己才真中了魔。
    五位道士齐来到，
    不去捉妖先把酒喝。上板有一个面黄肌瘦无精打彩，
    暗中倒有三个小老婆。
    有一个肥头大耳白净子脸，
    浑吃闷睡好吃又好喝。
    有一个脸上的烟灰三寸厚，
    抽足了鸦片才会降魔。
    那两位年轻的还倒好，
    “哈德门”作“高射炮”，白面抽得多。
    五位都吃饱喝足上了座，
    打起来法器叮叮当当把妖捉。
    头一请，请来一瘸一点的瘸拐李，
    二一请，请来了雷公奶奶与风婆，
    三一请，请的本是黄天霸，
    还没有请到就起了风波。
    只听得病房里一阵乱，
    孩子哭娘，大人喊老婆。
    王妻张氏病沉重，
    没有吃药只把香灰水儿喝；
    香灰本来不治病，
    又不能安眠，院里打鼓又敲锣；
    因此上病重神虚咽了气，
    一命呜呼，连句遗言也没有说！
    这才急疯了王老二，
    跺脚捶胸无奈何。
    哭一声妻来叫一声小儿女，
    咱们的冷热饥饱以后对谁说！
    抄起来叉钯扫帚往外跑，（注：扫读第四声）
    去打那骗人的道士与巫婆。
    道士们早已溜了个净，
    偷去了馒头两菠萝；
    李四妖婆也没了影，
    去到那张家村儿李家店儿乱扯又胡说。
    无奈何放下叉钯搂住小儿女，
    王老二满脸热泪混身打哆嗦。
    千不该来万不是，
    他不该相信妖怪与神佛。
    万物之灵人为首，
    怎可以对着泥胎木偶把头磕？
    干活的吃饭才合理，
    和尚老道不该念经，应该去作活。
    王老二家破人亡祸由自取，
    谁教他不用脑筋乱信妖魔！
    这一回破除迷信真重要，
    都只为，事事合理，人人生产，工农康乐，才能建起那新中国！
