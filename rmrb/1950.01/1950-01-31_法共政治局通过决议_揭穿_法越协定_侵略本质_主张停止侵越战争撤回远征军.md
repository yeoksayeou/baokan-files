Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 30th: TASS, Paris: The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party adopted a resolution on the 27th, exposing the agreement concluded between Auriol and Bảo Đại as a manifestation of colonial policy. It pointed out that this policy is a corporate deception of the Vietnamese people, allowing the puppet emperor Bảo Đại, who was yesterday an agent of Japanese aggressors and today simultaneously serves as a tool of French imperialists and their American masters, to remain in power. The Political Bureau believes that, in this situation, the extravagant talk about Vietnamese independence is also vile and hypocritical. Only the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by Ho Chi Minh, truly represents the Vietnamese people who are fighting for freedom and independence. The establishment of this republic is the result of the liberation movement against Japanese aggressors. The French colonialists are fighting against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and supporting a puppet government spurned by the Vietnamese people.

The Political Bureau declared that parliamentary approval of the agreement concluded between Auriol and Bảo Đại would prolong the war. Bankers, merchants, speculators, and corrupt politicians are getting rich off this war. An increasing number of French men and women oppose this war, demanding an end to this shameful war and the withdrawal of the expeditionary force.

The Political Bureau authorized the French Communist Party's parliamentary group to expose the French government's colonial policy and to vote against the ratification of the agreement concluded between Auriol and Bảo Đại. The Political Bureau criticized the leaders of the French Socialist Party for being controlled by Moch and becoming accomplices in anti-labor and anti-democratic repression. The Political Bureau called on the working people to unite and resist all threats from the warmongers. The Political Bureau urged the working people of the Socialist Party to remain true to their ideals and to fight alongside their Communist comrades and all working people for bread, freedom, and peace.

    法共政治局通过决议
    揭穿“法越协定”侵略本质
    主张停止侵越战争撤回远征军
    【新华社北京三十日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党政治局于三十七日通过决议，揭穿阿里奥尔与保大所缔结的协定是殖民政策的表现，指出这种政策是企业欺骗越南人民，使他们允许那个昨天是日本侵略者的代理人而今天又一身兼任法国帝国主义者及其美国主子的工具的逊王保大当权。政治局认为：在这情况下，关于越南独立的侈谈也是下贱的、伪装的。只有以胡志明为首的越南民主共和国，真正代表正在为自由和独立而奋斗的越南人民，这个共和国的成立，是反对日本侵略者的解放运动的结果。而法国殖民者正在对越南民主共和国作战，并且正在扶植一个为越南人民大众所唾弃的伪政府。
    政治局宣称：议会批准阿里奥尔与保大所缔结的协定，将使战争继续延长。银行家、商人、投机家和腐化政客正在靠这个战争发财致富。反对这个战争的法国男女已日益众多，他们要求停止这个可耻的战争，撤回远征军。
    政治局授权法共议会党团揭穿法国政府的殖民政策，并投票反对批准阿里奥尔与保大所缔结的协定。政治局抨击法国社会党领袖们为莫克所左右，而正在成为反劳工和反民主镇压行动中的同谋犯。政治局号召劳动人民团结起来，抵抗战争贩子的一切威胁。政治局敦促社会党的劳动人民忠于他们的理想，与共产党同志及一切劳动人民并肩为面包、自由及和平而奋斗。
