Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 26th. The Hebei Provincial People's Government convened a provincial economic conference on the 5th, which lasted ten days and ended on the 15th. In addition to the main cadres of each special zone, city, county, town, and provincial-level agencies and specialized companies, local labor heroes and models were also invited to participate. The meeting was presided over by Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Provincial Government, and Lin Tie, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, was also invited to attend. After Chairman Yang Xiufeng explained this year's production policy and tasks, discussions were conducted separately. In addition to industrial production, which will be studied separately in accordance with the national plan, the meeting finally determined the province's agricultural increase and disaster area production self-help plan for this year.

The province plans to increase grain production by 1.43 billion catties this year and plant 12 million mu of cotton.

Regarding the agricultural increase plan, the meeting decided that in general areas, efforts should be made to restore the pre-war normal production level this year; in areas that have reached or exceeded the pre-war level, efforts should be made to increase by about half a percent; in newly liberated areas where land reform has been completed, efforts should be made to increase by 10%; in heavily affected areas, efforts should be made to restore pre-disaster yields; in lightly affected areas, in addition to restoring production and overcoming disasters, efforts should be made to increase production appropriately. In total, the province plans to increase grain production by 1.43 billion catties this year. The meeting also determined to complete the planting of 12 million mu of cotton (this number accounts for one-quarter of the total cotton acreage in the country) and ensure that the average yield of ginned cotton reaches 29 catties per mu.

In order to ensure the realization of the above plan, the meeting determined that governments at all levels must organize labor mutual aid in accordance with the principle of voluntary association, so as to improve the existing farming techniques; pay attention to protecting livestock and complete the task of breeding 200,000 young animals; in terms of increasing fertilizer application, in order to ensure that the plan of applying one large cart of fertilizer per mu of arable land in spring plowing is achieved, in addition to the bank's planned lending of more than 20 million catties of fertilizer, we should also vigorously mobilize the masses in the plains to raise pigs, and the masses in the mountains to raise sheep, regulate fuel, and save straw for composting and other methods to solve the fertilizer problem. The meeting also determined that 80% of the well-drilling plan should be completed before May, and all old wells and old waterwheels should be repaired to prevent reduced production due to spring drought.

In order to strive for each disaster victim to store three to five dou of grain before spring plowing, it is necessary to develop diversified sideline production through cooperatives and solve the sales problem.

Regarding production self-help in disaster areas, the meeting conducted very serious discussions and research. It was unanimously agreed that it is necessary to strive to achieve the plan of storing three to five dou of grain for each disaster-stricken labor force before spring plowing in order to tide over the spring famine and support spring plowing. The main method to achieve this plan is to organize disaster victims to develop diversified sideline production through cooperatives. The meeting also formulated specific operation and promotion plans for several major sideline products (including homespun cloth, leather nitrate, mats, straw braid, fishery, etc.). Regarding funding, in addition to determining that the 200 million catties of coarse grains allocated by the Central People's Government should be used in a planned manner through cooperatives to purchase agricultural and sideline products, the main reliance should be on mobilizing the masses for mutual assistance, turning dead wealth into living wealth, and solving problems through free lending. Regarding raw materials, cooperatives should adjust them uniformly in a planned manner. The meeting decided to appropriately adjust the situation where Baiyangdian is short of reeds and the Tianjin area has many reeds. Regarding the promotion of products, the meeting especially summarized the past shortcomings of only looking at the top, only looking outside, and neglecting internal adjustment and mobilizing the masses to organize sales. It determined that in the future, it is necessary to start with improving product quality, promote the contract system between trade companies and cooperatives, and encourage legitimate merchants and mass organizations to organize transportation and sales to solve the problem.

    河北省召开经济会议
    制定今年农业增产及生产救灾计划
    争取在一般地区恢复战前常年产量
    【新华社保定二十六日电】河北省人民政府于五日召开全省经济会议，历时十日，十五日结束。到会者除各专区、市、县、镇及省级各机关与各专业公司等主要干部外，并邀有各地劳动英雄、模范参加。会议由省府杨秀峰主席主持，中共河北省委书记林铁亦应邀参加。会议首由杨秀峰主席说明今年的生产方针与任务后，即分别进行讨论。除工业生产依照全国计划，另行专门研究外，会议最后确定了今年全省的农业增产与灾区生产自救的计划。
    全省计划今年增产粮食十四亿三千万斤，植棉一千二百万亩。
    关于农业增产计划，会议决定：在一般地区，争取今年恢复战前的常年产量的生产水平；在已达到或超过战前水平的地区，争取提高半成左右；在已完成土地改革的新区争取提高一成；在重灾区争取恢复灾前产量；在轻灾区除恢复生产、战胜灾荒外，争取适当的提高。总计全省计划今年增产粮食十四亿三千万斤。会议并确定完成一千二百万亩的植棉计划（此数为全国植棉总亩数的四分之一），并保证达到每亩平均产皮棉二十九斤的要求。
    为保证实现上述计划，会议确定：各级政府必须依照自愿结合的原则，组织劳力互助，使现有耕作技术提高一步；注意保护牲畜，并完成繁殖二十万幼畜任务；在增施肥料方面，为保证达到春耕地每亩施肥一大车的计划，除银行有计划地贷出肥料二千余万斤外，还应大力发动平原群众喂猪、山地群众养羊，调剂燃料，以节省禾秸沤粪等办法，来解决肥料问题。会议还确定了在五月前完成凿井计划的百分之八十和全部修好旧井、旧水车，以防止春旱减产。
    为争取每个灾民在春耕前储存三斗到五斗粮食，要经过合作社开展多种多样副业生产，并解决销路问题。
    关于灾区的生产自救，会议进行了极认真的讨论与研究。一致认为必须争取实现每个灾民劳动力在春耕前储存三斗至五斗粮食，以渡过春荒、支持春耕的计划。实现这一计划的主要方法，是经过合作社组织灾民开展多种多样的副业生产。会议并制定了几种主要副业产品（包括土布、皮硝、席子、草帽辫、鱼业等）的具体经营与推销计划。关于资金方面，会议除确定以中央人民政府所拨之粗粮二亿斤有计划地经过合作社收购农副业产品外，主要应依靠发动群众互助、变死财为活财与自由借贷等办法解决。关于原料方面，合作社应有计划地统一调剂。会议确定适当调节白洋淀缺苇、天津专区苇多的情况。关于产品的推销，会议特别总结了以往只看上面、只看外面而忽视内地调剂与发动群众组织推销的缺点，确定了今后须从提高产品质量入手，推广贸易公司与合作社的合同制，鼓励正当商人及群众组织运销等办法解决。
