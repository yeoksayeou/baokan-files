Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th—The National Railway Materials Conference convened by the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government lasted three days and concluded on the 27th. Attending the conference were 63 people, including the heads of materials departments from the Northeast, North, and South Railway Administrations, representatives from the Ministry of Railways' bureaus, and experts. The main topic of the conference was how to improve materials work by adopting scientific management methods under the principle of self-reliance. The conference decided to implement a materials enterprise system and a supply responsibility system to unify the management of railway materials to achieve the goal of saving state resources. The so-called materials supply responsibility system means that the inventory materials of all supply units (materials departments of each Railway Administration and materials sections of each sub-bureau) and the surplus materials of all production units (locomotive, engineering, electrical, inspection, and various factories) will be centrally managed and distributed by the materials bureau. All supply units should establish a material inspection system to conduct inspections on the use, management, and supply of materials at any time. Each production unit should report the material settlement and inventory materials to the supply unit every month, and the supply unit will be responsible to the higher-level authorities at each level. The so-called material enterprise system means that when each production unit needs materials, it should sign a material sales contract with each supply unit according to the approved material budget and pay the price. The establishment of the above system will gradually eliminate the unreasonable phenomena of material waste, waste, and corruption caused by decentralized material management and inaccurate budgeting in the past.

The conference believes that the national railway materials work in 1949 was successful. In particular, the collection of equipment and materials was enthusiastically responded to by local party, government, military, civilians, and various railway administrations following the call issued by the Ministry of Railways in August of last year. By the end of last year, a total of 39,140 tons of various materials had been collected in various places, of which 30,691 tons were usable materials, which guaranteed the supply of materials for railway emergency repairs and played a major role in the rapid restoration of the people's railways. The main shortcoming in past work was the bureaucratic work style of not conducting in-depth work inspections, which resulted in untimely material supply and serious waste.

The conference stipulated the tasks of railway materials work for 1950. According to the work plan of the Ministry of Railways this year, the focus of this year's materials work is to supply the materials needed for the restoration project. Among them, the amount of steel materials needed will be doubled compared with last year. The source of these materials, in addition to ordering from state-owned enterprises, mainly depends on the collection and self-manufacturing in various places. The meeting pointed out that the task in 1950 is arduous, and everyone must organize and work hard.

    铁道部召集全国材料会议
    决定实行材料企业化与供应负责制
    【新华社北京二十八日电】中央人民政府铁道部召集的全国铁路材料会议历时三日，已于二十七日结束。出席这次会议的，有东北、北方、南方各管理局材料部门负责人，铁道部各局代表，及专家等六十三人。会议的主要议题是如何在自力更生的原则下，采取科学的管理方法，做好材料工作。会议决定实行材料企业化和供应负责制，统一管理铁路材料，以达到节省国家资材的目的。所谓材料供应负责制就是：各供应单位（各管理局材料处及分局材料科）的库存材料和各生产单位（机务、工务、电务、检车及各厂）所多余的材料，统一由材料局施行集中管理、分配。各供应单位应建立材料检查制度，对材料的使用、管理、供应等各方面，随时进行检查，各生产单位每月应将用料决算和库存材料向供应单位报告，供应单位逐级向上级负责。所谓材料企业化制度，即各生产单位需用材料时，应根据批准的用料预算，向各供应单位订立材料销售合同，计价支付。以上制度的建立，将逐步消灭过去因材料分散管理和预决算不准确而造成的材料废置、浪费和贪污等不合理的现象。
    会议认为：一九四九年全国的铁路材料工作是有成绩的，尤其是搜集器材工作，各地党、政、军、民和各管理局都曾经热烈响应去年八月铁道部发出的号召。到去年年底，各地总共搜集了各种材料三九、一四○吨，其中能用的材料是三○、六九一吨，保证了铁路抢修中的材料供应，对于人民铁路的迅速恢复起了重大作用。过去工作中的主要缺点是存在着工作检查不深入的官僚主义作风，因而造成了材料供应不及时和严重的浪费现象。
    会议规定了一九五○年铁路材料工作的任务。根据铁道部今年的工作计划，今年材料工作的重点是供应修复工程所需用的材料，其中钢铁材料一项即较去年所需要的增加一倍，而这些材料的来源，除向国营企业订购外，主要依靠各地搜集和自己制造。会议指出：一九五○年的任务是繁重的，大家必须组织起来刻苦奋斗。
