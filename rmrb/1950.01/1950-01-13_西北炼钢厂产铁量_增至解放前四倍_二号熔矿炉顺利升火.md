Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 10th. The No. 2 ore smelting furnace at the Northwest Steel Plant in Taiyuan was successfully ignited on January 6th, and its daily production reached the original designed capacity. Consequently, the plant's iron production has increased to four times the pre-Liberation level. The No. 2 ore smelting furnace ceased production in 1946 due to damage to the blower and other parts. After eight months of intensive repairs by workers from the repair department, power department, Yucai Machine Factory, and other units, it was restored to operation last year. When the furnace was ignited, Wang Shiying, Vice Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, Lai Ruoyu, Deputy Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Kang Yonghe, Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and others attended to offer congratulations and light the ignition rod.

    西北炼钢厂产铁量
    增至解放前四倍
    二号熔矿炉顺利升火
    【新华社太原十日电】太原西北炼钢厂二号熔矿炉，已于本月六日升火，当日生产即达原设计产量。至此，该厂产铁量已增加到解放前的四倍。二号熔矿炉于一九四六年因鼓风机等破损而停止生产，去年经修理部、动力部、育才机器厂等工友八个月的紧张修理，才得复工。当升火时，山西省府副主席王世英、中共山西省委副书记赖若愚、省总工会主席康永和等均到场致贺，执杆点火。
