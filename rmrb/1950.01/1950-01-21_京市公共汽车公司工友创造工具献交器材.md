Beijing News: Workers of the Beijing Public Bus Company, after accepting the 1950 production tasks, launched work with boundless enthusiasm, actively developing their creative talents, and voluntarily donating tools for repairing vehicles. Zhu Guangming, a lathe operator in the machine shop, created tools for cleaning crankshafts and connecting rod bearings, greatly saving working time and improving product quality. In the past, cleaning crankshafts could only be done with hand tools, but now it can be done quickly on a lathe. In the past, a grade-one worker could only complete thirty connecting rod bearings a day, but now they can complete fifty. Li Shunxiang, a worker in the repair department, donated his own socket wrenches, scrapers, springs, pliers, and other tools. Li Qisu, a driver, donated a set of platinum contact points (circuit breaker). Du Xingqi donated an electric switch. In addition, driver Zhang Pengran overhauled a truck himself and guaranteed to the repair shop that it would not need to be repaired in the factory for four months, and that other repairs would not take up working time. Driver Ma Ruiqing, who previously held the concept of working to eat, now strives to run the first and last trips, and does not return to the factory for minor problems. The No. 29 bus he drives has not been overhauled for four months, exceeding the inspection period and creating a new record.

    京市公共汽车公司工友创造工具献交器材
    【北京讯】北京市公共汽车公司工人在接受了一九五○年生产任务后，以无比的热情展开工作、积极发挥创造才能，并自动献出修理车用的工具。机工间车工朱光明创造了洗曲轴和洗连杆瓦的工具，大大地节省了工作时间，提高了产品质量，过去洗曲轴只能用手工具去作，现在放在车床上即可很快洗出。过去洗连杆瓦，一级工一天只能完成三十个，现在则能完成五十个。修理部工人李顺祥献出了自己的丁字套管、刮刀、弹簧、钳子等工具。车路司机李其速献出了白金（遮断器）一付。杜兴岐献出了三开电门一只。此外还有司机张鹏然自己大修了一部卡车，并向修理厂提出保证：四个月内不用再入厂修理，其他修理也不占用工作时间。司机马瑞清过去抱着干活吃饭的观念，现在则争取出头车收末车，小毛病不回厂。他驾驶的一部二十九号车，已四个月没大修，超过了检修期，创造了新纪录。
