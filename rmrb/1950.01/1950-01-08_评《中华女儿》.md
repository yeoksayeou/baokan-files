    A Critique of "Daughters of China"
    Zhong Dianfei
    The fourth artistic film produced by Dongbei Film Studio, "Daughters of China," has had a positive reception in the capital. It tells us, without exaggeration, about the arduous journey the Chinese people have traveled. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation have exchanged their precious lives for today's victory, proving that we are a great nation that cannot be humiliated or subdued! Today, we need to unearth and depict the historical traces of struggle over the past twenty years, and "Daughters of China" is precisely such a work. It is indeed sufficient to educate the broad masses of the Chinese people and make them aware of the true face of their nation.
    In terms of the film's production techniques, it is also satisfactory. Although it has not yet reached perfection, film, for us today, is still a new realm. To be able to achieve such results today is not easy! The leap forward in this new artistic field over the past two or three years, and the achievements of our actors and directors on the screen, are indeed worthy of our celebration.
    Therefore, my following comments will not be to point out the shortcomings of this film due to the many difficult conditions under which it was produced; but rather to say, in the course of the development of this artistic undertaking, how can we learn from its experience after each piece of work, in order to seek improvement in another work.
    Originally, I heard that this film was to be called "Eight Women Throw Themselves into the River," but it was later changed to "Daughters of China." This change is good. In terms of expressing the activeness of the theme, it is indeed better than "Eight Women Throw Themselves into the River."
    The story of the "Eight Women Throwing Themselves into the River" powerfully illustrates the invincibility and unsubduability of the Chinese nation, and it is inherently typical. But at the same time, we must not forget that similar stories have accumulated a lot during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan (which in the Northeast should naturally be counted from 1931 onwards) and the three years of the War of Liberation! The abundance, of course, does not hinder the worthiness of "Daughters of China" to be brought to the screen. But I think that this subject matter has not been fully developed. Among the characters, we only know Hu Xiuzhi relatively clearly, and the others are relatively vague. The instructor naturally has more activities and people are more familiar with him, but this character seems "flat." There are even fewer impressions of other people. Therefore, the reaction caused in the audience after they threw themselves into the river is not strong enough (this is naturally related to the director's rough handling at the end, and his inability to calm down). What aroused a strong reaction from the audience, many people felt, was Hu Xiuzhi's joining the Party. The tears of many viewers flowed with the tears of Hu Xiuzhi. Why is this? I think there are two aspects: on the one hand, it makes people realize that the Communist Party is indeed the organizer and encourager of the oppressed, especially in such difficult years, the Party tirelessly organizes every backbone in the struggle, which is of great and decisive significance for upholding such a tense and cruel situation at that time; on the other hand, Hu Xiuzhi, who is well-known and has just escaped from disaster, has become a glorious Communist Party member, and we congratulate her – this also illustrates a problem, that is, the character of Hu Xiuzhi is indeed more completely sculpted.
    This involves a question: in a subject matter like "Daughters of China," which introduces the struggle against the enemy in the base areas, is it necessary to portray the characters? I think it is necessary. Because judging from the effect of Hu Xiuzhi, portraying the characters does no harm. If we could introduce more about the instructor's and other comrades' backgrounds (which naturally has to be linked to the historical facts of the struggle), then the effect of this film would be even better. Because this would enhance its artistic generality, enhance the story's appeal, and make it more invincible in art. We can see that the writers and directors have put a lot of effort into reflecting the hard life of fighting behind enemy lines, such as the scenes of collecting mushrooms in the absence of food, the scenes of hunting wild boars, the scenes of two villagers sending food to the guerrillas in the snow, the scenes of gorging on hot sorghum rice, and the scenes of setting up observation posts in the white poplar trees, and the scenes of dancing barefoot in the cold winter... These are all very fascinating. But unfortunately, these things have not been strung together by the red line of characters and events, so it seems scattered, fragmented, and becomes something that disappears in a flash, in other words, it is not more alive!
    Am I saying that "Daughters of China" should write about characters in an average and parallel way? To become a "Biography of Heroic Women"! No. I am only saying that in the liberation struggle of the Chinese nation, which is still regarded as a miracle, it is basically because the members in this struggle are in a common destiny, and they (and they) have their own different experiences, which make them (and them) become comrades in the struggle, begin to become indomitable, and later become an indestructible force! What is most precious? People. People who have gradually become aware and organized through struggle have great significance and persuasiveness. But today, the characters in "Daughters of China", except for Hu Xiuzhi, other characters appear bland - I think this is its so-called "imperfection".
    In addition to this, there are also several other "imperfections":
    First, Hu Xiuzhi was wounded in the first battle, and because the situation was urgent, she was lost on the battlefield, but she finally climbed back with perseverance. What was encouraging her? The lens tells us: the encouragement of the instructor and the captain - this is naturally important, but I think what is more important should be her hatred for the enemy, as the lens has shown us: in the enemy's merging village policy, her husband was buried in the flames! This is what Hu Xiuzhi should remember, and will definitely be remembered. So I think what is missing here is not a lens, but the most real inner activities of a fighting character!
    Second, the last battle was after the death of the squad leader - the instructor's lover. This can certainly arouse a strong motivation to encourage the instructor to accept this battle mission, but this alone is not enough; the captain did not equip enough strength in this battle mission, and lacked thorough planning and clear instructions in the battle deployment; even after the instructor discovered the enemy's situation, he transferred the two male comrades with stronger combat effectiveness in the squad - the future of this is unimaginable! As a result, the situation of disparity in strength and numbers was created later. After blowing up the bridge, the enemy was determined to retaliate against this combat team. In order to attract the enemy's firepower and give the large forces a chance to transfer, they fired at the enemy first, but this was not fully explained on the screen, so when they retreated to the river, the action itself easily led the audience to misunderstand their imprudence - fighting with their backs to the water! Looking at the combat movements of this squad, their combat quality is not high. They often form dense formations in their advance and movement, so they are greatly injured by the enemy's grenade launchers. Even after the instructor sacrificed, several people carried her forward, tightly united on the riverbank! The directors deliberately showed their fearlessness in the face of danger in these places, praising their ambition, but did not fully realize that they were a combat team, that they were on the battlefield, that the purpose of war was to eliminate the enemy and preserve themselves - all of this can easily constitute the defect of this theme - they are a heroic team, their deeds are commendable and tearful, but they lack wisdom, and lack the most necessary training and knowledge in battle.
    The instructor - this is a character who embodies the leadership of the Party. In any case, she cannot accept this battle mission on her own impulse; even if this kind of battle mission has become commonplace in the guerrilla team at that time; if it is not to blow up the bridge, it is even unnecessary for someone like the instructor to lead the team in person. But once the mission is accepted, it cannot be taken lightly. This script, in portraying this character, has again made some mistakes in writing about positive characters. In terms of acting, this character also lacks real inner activities, especially lacking the fortitude character tempered from the war (this is really necessary in the creation of the image of a fighting character!), so some people feel that this seems like a team formed by a group of intellectuals after watching it. This, of course, is detrimental to this theme.
    Here I am reminded of many heroic sacrifices and characters in the struggle behind enemy lines. They did pay the most sublime price in the battle, which makes people feel heartbroken, but after the pain subsides, sometimes I also feel that some pain, if we had correctly implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's strategy and tactics at that time, then the pain could be avoided, or reduced, or even turned into happiness. In this way, it gives me reason to propose that in our records of past struggle history, we need to spend some thought to understand, organize, and refine and improve the original materials. Generally speaking, the writing method of real people and real events has given us a lot of benefits in literary and artistic creation. Through it, we have given life to abstract thinking and displayed many simple and lovely lives. However, this has also made some of our creations remain on the accumulation of materials until today, without refining, without generalization, without criticism, and without daring to enrich and improve on the basis of reality. Therefore, we cannot better enable the author and the audience or the reader to enrich our knowledge of struggle from the past struggle history (naturally not all), and thereby improve the wisdom of the Chinese people's struggle.
    In our works, we have described many new heroic figures who have sacrificed themselves in the revolutionary struggle and paid the most precious price for the people! What else can be criticized? There is nothing to criticize about heroes. However, artistic creation should not stop here. Since the martyrs' blood has flowed for future generations, the task of artistic creation should enlighten their descendants: revolution inevitably involves bloodshed, but not because we like bloodshed, but only when it is inevitable that we shed blood. It is cowardly to shed blood when we should shed blood, which is detrimental to the revolution; but to be able to shed less blood or not shed blood at all is still something that every revolutionary must strive for. Therefore, I advocate that literary and artistic creation should be improved from the writing method of real people and real events. This improvement is naturally not to advocate general fiction. Rather, it is to strive to affirm those subjects that are positive (wise and brave) in the past struggle; and to criticize, improve and supplement those negative (brave but unwise) subjects. I think this is beneficial both in improving the creation of art and in the educational significance of the people's revolutionary cause.

    评《中华女儿》
    钟惦棐
    东影出品的第四部艺术片——《中华女儿》在首都献演的效果是好的。它毫不夸张地把中国人民所走过的艰难路程告诉我们。中华民族的优秀儿女，在中国共产党的领导之下，用宝贵的生命换得了今天的胜利。证明了我们是一个不可侮、不能屈的伟大民族！今天，我们正需要发掘，描写二十多年来的斗争史迹，《中华女儿》正是这样的一个作品，它的确足以教育广大的中国人民，使他们认识自己民族的真实面貌。
    在影片的摄制技术上，也还是令人满意的，虽然它尚未达于尽善，但电影，这对我们今天说来，还是个新的境域，能够获得今天这样的成果，却也是不容易的事了！这个新的艺术事业部门两三年来的飞跃进展，以及我们演员及导演同志们在银幕上的成就，确是值得我们庆幸的。
    因此，我下面的意见，将不是来指摘这部片子由于许多困难条件所使之产生的缺陷；而是说，在这一艺术事业的发展途中，我们在每一件工作之后，如何来吸取它的经验，以期在另一作品中去谋求改进。
    原来，听说这部片子是要叫做《八女投江》的，后来改作《中华女儿》，这一改，是好的。在表明主题的积极性方面，的确比《八女投江》好。
    《八女投江》的事迹，有力的说明了中华民族的不可侮、不能屈，它的本身是具有典型性的。但同时我们不可忘记：类似这种故事，在八年的抗日战争（在东北自然应该从一九三一年以后）以及三年的解放战争中是积累得很多的！多，自然并不妨碍《中华女儿》的值得搬上银幕。但我以为，这题材并未予以充分的展开，人物中我们知道得比较清楚的只有一个胡秀芝，其他的都比较模糊。指导员自然活动较多，人们比较熟悉，但这个人物显得“平面”。其他的人，印象更少。所以在她们投江之后，在观众中所引起的反响是不够强烈的（这自然与在临结尾时导演的手法上显得粗糙，没有能够沉住气有关系）。引起观众强烈反应的，许多人都觉得是在胡秀芝的入党。不少观众的眼泪随着胡秀芝的眼泪流出来了。这是因为什么呢？我想，有两方面：一方面是使人体会到共产党确是受压迫者的组织者和鼓励者，特别在这样艰苦的岁月里，党毫不疲倦的把斗争中的每一个骨干组织起来，这对于坚持当时那样紧张残酷的局面，是具有巨大的、决定的意义的；另一方面，则是人们所熟知的新从灾难中逃出来的胡秀芝，居然成了光荣的共产党员，为她庆幸——这中间也同时说明了一个问题，即胡秀芝这个人物确是雕刻得比较完全。
    这里涉及到一个问题，在像《中华女儿》这样一个作为介绍根据地对敌斗争的题材，要不要刻划人物？我看是要的。因为从胡秀芝的效果看，刻划人物并没有坏处。如果能够更多一点的介绍介绍指导员及其他同志的身世（这中间自然要连贯到斗争史实的），则这片子的效果还会更好些。因为这样增强了它在艺术上的概括性，增强了故事的感染力，在艺术上更加立于不败之境。我们可以看见，编导者在要反映敌后艰苦斗争生活方面是费了许多苦心的，如在描写缺乏粮食情形下的采集蘑菇的镜头，猎取野猪的镜头，两个老乡在雪地里给游击队送粮的镜头，对着热腾腾的高粱米饭饕餮的镜头，以及在白杨树上放了望哨的镜头，赤着脚在寒冬里跳舞的镜头……这些都是很能引人入胜的。但可惜这些东西，没有被人物以及事件的红线贯穿起来，所以它显得是涣散的、零碎的，成为转眼即逝的东西，换句话说，它没有更活起来！
    我这样说，是不是要求《中华女儿》中应该平均并列的去写人物？成为一部《烈女传》！不是的。我只是说，在至今被人认作奇迹的中华民族的解放斗争，它基本的是由于这一斗争中的成员是处于一个共同的命运，而他们（和她们）又带着各自不同的遭遇，使她们（和他们）在斗争中成为同志，开始成为不可屈服，后来成为无坚不摧的力量！什么东西最可宝贵？人。从斗争中逐渐觉悟了并且经过组织起来的人，这是有巨大意义和说服力的。但今天《中华女儿》的人物，个别的除胡秀芝外，其他人物都显得平淡——我认为这是它的所谓“美中不足”的地方。
    除此之外，也还有其他几个“美中不足”的地方：
    第一、胡秀芝在第一次战斗中负伤了，因为情况紧急了，被丢失在战地上，而她终于坚毅地爬了回来，什么东西在鼓舞着她？镜头告诉我们：指导员和队长对她的鼓励——这自然是重要的，但我以为更重要的应该是她对敌人的仇恨心，像镜头上所显示过给我们的：在敌人的并屯政策中，她的丈夫被埋葬在烈火之中！这是胡秀芝应该会记取，而且一定会被记取的。所以我以为这里少的不是一个镜头，而是一个斗争人物最真实的内心活动！
    第二、最后一次战斗，是在小队长——指导员的爱人殉难之后，这固然能够引起一种强烈的动机来鼓励指导员接受这次战斗任务，但仅仅这点，是不行的；队长没有在这次战斗任务中配备足够的力量，而在战斗布署上又缺乏周密的计划与明确的指示；甚至指导员在发现敌情以后，还把小队中战斗力较强的两个男同志调走了——这个前途是不堪设想的！以致造成后来强弱众寡悬殊之势。炸桥之后，敌人决心要对这个战斗队施以报复，她们为了吸引敌人的火力，使大队得到转移的机会，先向敌人开枪了，但这在银幕上说明得很不充分，所以当她们向江边撤退的时候，这行动的本身容易引起观众误解她们的不智——背水作战！再从这个小队的战斗动作上看，她们的作战素质并不高，她们在前进和移动中经常是密集队形，所以被敌人的掷弹筒杀伤很大，甚至她们在指导员牺牲之后，几个人抬着她挺身前进，密结在江边！导演者在这些地方是有意的表现她们在临危时无所畏惧。表扬她们的志气，但没有充分认识到她们是个战斗队，是在战场上，战争的目的是要消灭敌人，保存自己——如此等等，都很容易构成这个题材的缺陷——她们是英勇的队伍，她们的事迹可歌可泣，但她们缺乏智慧，在战斗中缺乏最必要的训练和知识。
    指导员——这是体现党的领导的一个人物。无论如何，她不能在自己一时的激动之下来接受这个战斗任务；即使这种战斗任务在当时的游击队中已经成为家常饭；如果不是炸毁桥梁的话，甚至是无须像指导员这样的人亲自去带队的。但既经接受任务，便不能轻易从事，这个脚本在刻划这个人物上，又多少犯了些写正面的积极人物不够的毛病。而在演技上，这个人物还缺乏真实的内心活动，尤其缺少从战火中锻炼出来的刚毅性格（这在斗争人物形象的创造上，实在是太必要了！），所以有人看了以后会觉得这好像一群知识分子结合起来的队伍。这一点，自然是有损于这个主题的。
    这里使我记起了在敌后斗争中许多壮烈牺牲的故事和人物，他们在战斗中确实付出了最崇高的代价，思之使人心痛，但当痛定之后，有时也觉得某些痛，如果我们当时正确的执行了毛泽东同志的战略战术，则其痛或可避免，或可减少，或甚至可以转痛为快的。这样，便使我有理由来提出：在我们记述往年斗争史迹中，需要费一番心思去认识、去组织、去把原来的素材加以提炼和提高。一般的说，真人真事的写作方法，曾经使我们在文艺创作上得到过不少的好处，我们通过它使抽象的思维获得了生命，显示了许多朴质可爱的生活。但是，这样也曾使我们某些创作一直到今天还停留在素材的堆砌上，没有提炼，没有概括，没有批判，不敢在现实的基础上加以丰富和提高，因此也就不能更好的使作者和观众或读者从已往的斗争史迹中（自然不是全部）去丰富我们的斗争知识，并借以提高中国人民斗争的智慧。
    在我们的作品中，描写过许多新的英雄人物，他们在革命斗争中舍己忘身，为人民付出了最高贵的代价！这还有什么可以非难的呢？对于英雄，无可非难。但是，艺术的创造不应该停留在这里。烈士们的血，既然为后代流了，艺术创造的任务，应该启示他们的后代：革命固然少不了流血的事，但并不是因为我们喜欢流血，而是在必不可免的时候，我们才流血的。该流血而不流血，这是怯懦者的行为，是有损于革命的；但可以不必流或者少流，这仍然是每个革命者要努力去争取的事。所以我主张在文艺创作上应该从真人真事的写作方法上提高一步。这种提高，自然不是提倡一般的虚构。而是说，努力肯定那些在已往斗争中属于积极的（智勇双全的）题材；而批判、提高和补足那些消极的（有勇无谋的）题材。我想，这无论在提高艺术的创造上说，和对人民革命事业的教育意义上说，都是有益的事。
