    State-Owned Enterprises Entrust Processing
    Private Cixing Iron Factory's Employees Increase More Than Tenfold
    People's Bank Provides Loan Support

    [This Newspaper News] Due to the large-scale entrustment of processing by state-owned enterprises and the loan support from the People's Bank, the production of Beijing's private Cixing Iron Factory has achieved rapid recovery and significant development over the past year. This factory is the largest private machinery iron factory in Beijing, with a relatively complete foundry and thirty-eight lathes, capable of manufacturing various machine tools, wool spinning machines, paper making machines, etc. Before liberation, due to the oppression of Kuomintang bureaucrat-capitalists and the invasion of imperialism, it could only do some odd jobs and repair machine parts, and its production capacity could not be utilized. On the eve of liberation, the machinery and equipment were damaged by the Kuomintang army, production was completely stopped, and only seventeen staff and workers were left (including only eight workers), with most of the rest dismissed. It was not until after the liberation of Beijing that recovery began. In April of last year, labor and management had differing opinions on the issue of hiring more workers, leading to a dispute; after the government helped to resolve it appropriately, the capitalists felt more at ease and hired a large number of workers to develop production. In May, in order to give the factory work to do and develop production, the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society entrusted the factory to cast 330 waterwheels (70 tons), and the foundry was fully restored, with the number of workers increasing to 90. In June, the North China Cement Company entrusted the factory to cast 20 tons of pig iron rods, and from July onwards, the Ministry of Railways successively entrusted the factory to process and cast a total of 150 tons of iron pipes and other railway materials. Due to the entrustment of processing and casting by state-owned enterprises, the factory's production gradually developed, the foundry was further expanded, and the number of employees increased from more than ten at the time of liberation to the current 192. Because production has developed, workers' wages have also generally increased. Before liberation, due to the drastic fluctuations in prices, the factory's wages could not be increased in a timely manner, and sometimes the workers' monthly income could only buy 30 kilograms of millet (September 1948). After liberation, wages were paid according to the real value standard, guaranteeing the actual wages that workers should receive. Labor-management relations have become normal, and workers are enthusiastic about production, often completing tasks ahead of schedule. In order to ensure that the iron pipes entrusted by the Ministry of Railways could be delivered on time, the workers voluntarily worked overtime. At the end of last year, the factory temporarily lacked funds and its turnover was not flexible. The People's Bank provided a loan of 100 million yuan, which enabled the factory to solve its difficulties in a timely manner. Last year, a total of 300 tons of products were cast, of which 250 tons were processed for state-owned enterprises. This year, the factory will continue to process for state-owned enterprises and plans to manufacture machines. Because the factory's equipment is already of considerable scale, it will develop towards specialized production in the future and continue to improve technology. (Zhong)

    国营企业委托加工
    私营慈型铁工厂职工增加十倍多
    人民银行贷款扶植
    【本报讯】由于国营企业大量委托加工、人民银行贷款扶植，北京私营慈型铁工厂的生产一年来获得迅速的恢复与显著的发展。该厂为京市规模最大之私营机器铁工厂，有较完善之翻砂厂和三十八部床子，能制造各种工作母机和纺毛机、造纸机等。解放前，由于国民党官僚资本的压迫和帝国主义的侵略，只能做一些零活和修理机器零件，生产能力不能发挥。在解放前夕，机器设备又遭国民党军破坏，生产全部停顿，只剩十七名职员和工人（内工人仅八名），其余大部遣散。直到北京解放后，才开始着手恢复。去年四月间，劳资两方因添雇工人问题意见分歧，发生争执；经政府帮助作了适当的解决，资方更放心地大量雇用工人，发展生产。五月间华北水利推进社为使该厂有活可做，发展生产，委托该厂铸造水车三百三十台（七十吨），翻砂厂遂得全部恢复，工人也增至九十人。六月间华北水泥公司又委托铸造生铁棍二十吨，七月份起，铁道部陆续委托加工铸造铁管共一百五十吨和其他铁路器材等。由于公营企业委托加工铸造，该厂生产日渐发展，翻砂厂更形扩大，职工人数也由解放时的十余人增加到现在的一百九十二人。因为生产得到发展，工人工资也普遍增高。解放前因物价跳动剧烈，该厂工资不能及时增加，有时工人一月所得仅能买三十斤小米（一九四八年九月），解放后工资按折实标准发给，保证了工人应得的实际工资。劳资关系趋于正常，工人生产积极，时常提前完成任务。为了保证铸铁道部委托加工的铁管能如期交货，工人曾自动加班干活。去年年底，该厂一时缺乏资金，周转欠灵活，人民银行又贷款一亿元，使该厂困难得以及时解决。去年全年共铸造三百吨产品，其中给公营企业加工占二百五十吨。本年该厂将继续给公营企业加工，并计划制造机器。由于该厂设备已有相当规模，将来将向专业化的生产方面发展，继续提高技术。（仲）
