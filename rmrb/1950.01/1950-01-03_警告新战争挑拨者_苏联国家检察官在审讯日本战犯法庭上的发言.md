Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 2nd: TASS, Berlik, reported: On the afternoon of December 29th, Soviet State Prosecutor Smirnov spoke at the military tribunal, pointing out the great significance of this trial and issuing a warning to those preparing for a new world war. Smirnov said: The current importance of the trial far exceeds the scope of establishing the individual guilt of the defendants and determining their responsibility. A chain against the most serious crimes against peace and progressive humanity links General Yamada Otozo, former commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, and the bacteriologists of the Japanese Army's Special Secret Organization, the executors of the Japanese warlords' sinister intentions. The bacteriological warfare planned and prepared by the nefarious Japanese imperialism is part of an aggressive conspiracy against peace-loving people.

For many years, imperialist Japan has been the main hotbed of aggression in the Far East. The Tokyo International Tribunal, which concluded the trial of Japanese major war criminals in 1948, has clearly confirmed that Japan had been preparing to attack the Soviet Union for many years. The judgment of the International Military Tribunal stated: The court believes that Japan, during this period, was formulating and planning an aggressive war against the Soviet Union... This was one of the main factors of Japanese national policy, with the aim of seizing Soviet territory in the Far East.

	The peace in the Soviet Far East was maintained due to Stalin's brilliant policy.

Under the direction of the largest monopoly conglomerates (which colluded with domestic senior military-feudal groups), Japanese imperialists had pre-arranged to include the Soviet Far East, and even "Siberia east of the Urals," into the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The failure of the Japanese imperialists' aggressive intentions towards the Soviet Union was by no means due to the peace-loving nature of the Japanese war criminals. The peace in the Soviet Far East was maintained only because of Stalin's brilliant policy, the victorious completion of Stalin's Five-Year Plan, and the unwavering concern of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government for strengthening the Soviet armed forces.

In 1936, the anti-peace conspiracy finally took shape. Japan and Hitler's Germany concluded the so-called Anti-Comintern Pact, and Fascist Italy also participated in this pact. In 1937, Japan invaded China; in 1938 and 1939, Japanese warlords twice attacked the Mongolian People's Republic and the Soviet Union, but were met with significant resistance. However, this did not make the Japanese warlords abandon their aggressive plans. In order to achieve this goal, Japanese imperialists began preparing the most shocking and inhuman means of mass extermination of people.

This trial proves that Japanese warlords were preoccupied with preparing bacteriological warfare in advance, studying the most effective means of conducting such warfare and the methods of its use. In this way, the evil-doers (some of whom are on trial) attempted to return mankind to an era of rampant infectious diseases, suffering from cholera and plague epidemics, returning to the darkest days of the Middle Ages. Bacteriological warfare activities were not limited to the front lines and enemy areas, it could bring incalculable suffering to the people of neutral countries. The State Prosecutor cited indisputable facts already proven during the preliminary investigation of the court, and recounted the history of the Japanese warlords' preparation for bacteriological warfare.

The State Prosecutor pointed out that the Ishii Unit launched bacteriological attacks on Soviet and Mongolian troops in 1939 during Japan's aggressive war in the Lake Khasan area. In 1940, 1941 and 1942, Unit 731 launched inhuman bacteriological attacks on the Chinese people.

	New warmongers attempt to prevent the exposure of Japanese bacteriological warfare crimes.

The State Prosecutor reminded the court that documents describing the "experiments" conducted by the "Tama" Unit (also known as "Rong" 1644 Unit) in Nanjing had been submitted to the Tokyo International Military Tribunal, which was interested in this fact and requested the American prosecutor to provide more evidence. Shortly thereafter, Soviet Prosecutor Smirnov of the International Tribunal presented the American chief advisor with the written confessions of Kawashima and Tang Ze, which clearly exposed the crimes committed by the Japanese ruling group in conducting malicious experiments on living people with bacteriological weapons. However, it is likely that certain powerful people wanted to prevent the exposure of the shocking crimes committed by the Japanese military, and did not want more documents about the activities of the "Tama" Unit and similar experiments conducted in the Ishii Unit to be submitted to the court.

	Ishii, Kitano, and other bacteriological war criminals, under the protection of imperialism, dream of having the opportunity to commit crimes again.

The State Prosecutor then stated, while analyzing the evidence determining the individual guilt of the defendants: The secret bacteriological unit of the Japanese Army was established according to the edict of the Japanese Emperor Hirohito. The participants in this criminal conspiracy are not limited to these criminals you are about to sentence. We know that some base and immoral servants of Japanese imperialism, former Japanese Army General and bacteriological expert Shiro Ishii, Kitano and Wakamatsu, former Unit 731 staff members Ota, Murakami, Igari, Tanaka, Yoshimura and others, have not been tried. Because they are outside our country's borders, they are currently under the protection of the reactionary forces of the imperialist camp. These reactionary forces themselves dream of having the opportunity to hurl explosives, atomic bombs and deadly bacteria at humanity.

The State Prosecutor said: The great significance of this trial lies in its naked exposure of the hideous faces of the Japanese imperialist robbers who prepared bacteriological warfare - one of the most inhumane weapons of aggression - in extreme secrecy. Only the deadly and destructive blow of the Soviet army saved the world from the terror of bacteriological warfare. Our motherland saved human civilization from disaster.

The verdict must not only severely and justly punish those criminals currently standing in the dock, but also issue a warning that cannot be ignored to the instigators of a new world war, because they and the criminals who are about to be convicted are equally cruel and vicious enemies of humanity.

Let all those who are planning new crimes against humanity and are preparing new weapons for mass slaughter remember firmly: the world has not forgotten the lessons of World War II. The powerful democratic front, led by the Soviet Union, is defending peace and security. This is a powerful and invincible force that will be able to suppress every instigator of a new war and impose severe punishment.

### 警告新战争挑拨者  苏联国家检察官在审讯日本战犯法庭上的发言

    警告新战争挑拨者
    苏联国家检察官在审讯日本战犯法庭上的发言
    【新华社北京二日电】据塔斯社伯力讯：十二月二十九日下午，苏联国家检察官斯米尔诺夫在军事法庭上发言，指出这次审判的重大意义，并对新的世界大战的准备者提出警告。斯米尔诺夫说：目前审讯的重要意义，远远超出确立被告犯人的个人罪名及确定他们的责任的范围。一条反对和平与进步人类之最严重罪行的锁链，将前日本关东军司令官山田乙三将军和日本军阀的罪恶意图的执行人——日本陆军特别秘密组织的细菌学家——连结在一起。由罪恶的日本帝国主义计划和准备的细菌战，是反对爱好和平人们的侵略阴谋的一部分。
    许多年以来，帝国主义的日本，一直就是远东的主要侵略温床，一九四八年结束的审讯日本主要战犯的东京国际法庭，已经十分明确地证实：日本许多年来一直在准备进攻苏联。国际军事法庭的判决书称：法庭认为日本在这一段时间中，都在拟订和计划反苏的侵略战争……这是日本国策的主要因素之一，其目的，在于侵占苏联在远东的领土。
            苏联远东和平能够维持，是由于斯大林的英明政策。
    在最大的垄断企业联合组织（它们与国内高级军事封建集团勾结在一起）的主使之下，日本帝国主义者即预先安排好将苏联远东，甚至将“乌拉尔以东的西伯利亚”，都包括到所谓“大东亚共荣圈”里。日本帝国主义者对苏联侵略意图的未能实现，决不是由于日本战犯的爱好和平。苏联远东的和平之所以能够维持，只是由于斯大林的英明政策，由于斯大林五年计划的胜利完成，由于布尔什维克党和苏联政府对加强苏联武装部队的始终不渝的关怀。
    一九三六年，反和平阴谋最后形成。日本与希特勒德国曾缔结所谓反共公约，法西斯意大利也参与了这个公约。一九三七年，日本侵入中国；一九三八年与一九三九年，日本军阀曾两次进攻蒙古人民共和国和苏联，但都遇到重大的反击。可是，这并没有使日本军阀放弃他们的侵略计划。为了达成这一目的起见，日本帝国主义者开始准备最令人震骇和惨无人道的大批消灭人民的手段。
    这次审讯证明，日本军阀预先就忙于准备细菌战，研究从事这种战争的最有效的手段及其使用方法。这样，作恶的家伙们（其中有一部分已在受审），企图使人类复归于传染病盛行的时代，遭受霍乱与鼠疫的瘟疫，复归于中世纪的最惨淡的日子。细菌战的活动，不局限于前线和敌人地区，它可能给中立国的人民带来无法计算的苦痛。国家检察官举出在法庭初步调查过程中业已证实的无容置辩的事实，重述了日本军阀准备细菌战争的史实。
    国家检察官指出，石井部队在一九三九年日本于哈桑湖地区发动侵略战争时，曾对苏联与蒙古部队进行细菌攻击。一九四○年、一九四一年及一九四二年，七三一部队曾对中国人民发动惨无人道的细菌进攻。
            新战贩妄图阻止揭露日本细菌战犯罪行。
    国家检察官提醒法庭说，叙述“玉”部队（也叫做“荣”一六四四部队）在南京从事“实验”的文件，已提交东京国际军事法庭，该法庭对这一事实感到兴趣，要求美国检察官提出更多的证据。此后不久，国际法庭苏方检察官斯米尔诺夫向美国的首席顾问提出了川岛和唐泽的书面供词，这供词十分明确地揭穿了日本统治集团在用活人进行关于细菌武器的恶毒实验中所犯的罪行。但是，很可能的，某些有势力的人，很想阻止揭露日本军方所犯的惊人罪行，也不愿再有更多关于“玉”部队的活动及石井部队中所进行的类似实验的文件，提交法庭。
            石井北野等细菌战犯在帝国主义卵翼下，梦想有机会再犯罪。
    国家检察官继而在分析确定被告个人罪行的证据时称：日本陆军的秘密细菌部队，是按照日本天皇裕仁的敕令建立的。这一罪恶阴谋的参加者，还不止于你们将要判决的这些罪犯。我们知道，一些日本帝国主义的卑污的毫无道德的仆从，前日本陆军上将、细菌专家石井四郎、北野和若松，前七三一部队的职员太田、村上、井狩、田中、芳村等人，都没有受审。由于他们是在我国的国境之外，他们目前正在帝国主义阵营反动势力的卵翼之下。这些反动势力本身也梦想他们有机会向人类投掷炸药、原子弹和致命细菌。
    国家检察官说：这次审讯的重大意义，在于它赤裸裸地暴露了在极端秘密中准备细菌战——最惨无人道的侵略武器之一——的日本帝国主义强盗的狰狞面目。只有苏军对敌人致命与毁灭性的打击，才使世界免于细菌战争的恐怖。我们祖国从灾难中挽救了人类文明。
    判决不仅要严厉地、公正地惩罚那些目前站在被告席上的罪犯，而且要对新的世界大战的煽动者发出不容漠视的警告，因为他们和即将被判罪的罪犯们，同是残忍狠毒的人类仇视者。
    让所有那些正在计划着新的反对人类的罪行并正在从事准备大规模屠杀人类新武器的人们牢牢记着：世界没有忘记第二次世界大战的教训。以苏联为首的强大的民主阵线，在保卫着和平与安全。这是一个强大的和战无不胜的力量，这个力量将能压制新战争的每一个煽动者，并予以严厉的惩罚。
