    Protecting Mothers and Infants
    Liaodong Reforms Old Midwives
    Counties Universally Open Midwifery Training Classes; Massively Train New Midwives Simultaneously
    [Our Newspaper Northeast News] The training of a large number of midwives and the reform of old midwives are underway throughout Liaodong Province. The province currently has three midwifery schools, and most counties have established midwifery training classes. As of the beginning of this month, more than 1,300 new midwives have completed their studies in twenty-one training classes, and 300 old midwives have been reformed. Most of the students in midwifery schools and training classes have undergone internships. According to incomplete statistics, students in Andong, Tonghua, and other places alone have practiced midwifery more than a thousand times, with good results. According to statistics from five districts in Linjiang County, there were 95 deliveries in four months, and both mothers and children were safe. The newly trained midwives and the reformed old midwives have begun to establish prestige among the masses with the excellent results achieved by their scientific methods. Tian Xin, a student at Tonghua Midwifery School, saved Liu Yunzhang's stillborn child with artificial respiration. Liu's wife gratefully said, "I have never seen such a caring delivery in all my years. I no longer believe in the superstitious talk that life and death are determined by fate."
    The rapid development of maternal and child health work in Liaodong has only occurred in the past two or three months. Prior to this, although the Liaodong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China had clearly put forward the guidelines for maternal and child health work, it did not receive enough attention in various places, and the actual difficulties of women were neglected. According to investigations in several typical villages in Tonghua, Linjiang, and other counties, 30% to 40% of infants died from various diseases due to unsanitary or unscientific delivery methods. In the Tianshifu District of Benxi County, eight women died from difficult labor in one month. After realizing the seriousness of this problem, the Tonghua Prefectural Committee first established a midwifery school, and other counties subsequently opened training classes. In mid-August of last year, the Tonghua Prefectural Committee also convened a joint meeting of women's committees from various counties to solemnly discuss this issue, and proposed that women's health work be regarded as a regular task in the future, and to do its best to develop maternal and child health undertakings. As some counties in the Tonghua area began to gain some experience, coupled with the introduction and promotion in the provincial newspapers, this work quickly attracted the attention of leaders in various counties throughout the province and achieved today's results. In order to strengthen leadership on the basis of the initial development of this work, the Provincial People's Government Health Bureau and the Provincial Women's Federation jointly issued a notice on carrying out maternal and child health work at the end of December before the new year, requiring more widespread maternal and child health education in rural areas. Taking the county as a unit, focusing on reforming old midwives and supplementing with the training of new midwives, continue to open midwifery training classes. In areas where conditions are not yet available, organize mobile lecture teams to conduct education in small groups or by lecturing on the kang.

    保护母亲保护婴儿
    辽东改造旧接产妇
    各县普遍开办接生训练班  同时大批培养新的助产士
    【本报东北讯】大批助产士的训练和旧接产妇的改造工作，正在辽东全省进行。全省现拥有三处助产学校，大部县份则举办了助产训练班。截至本月初旬止，在二十一期训练班中，已有一千三百余名新的助产士学习结业，三百名旧接产妇获得改造。助产学校和训练班的学员多半经过实习，据不完全统计，仅安东、通化等地学员即实习接生千余次，效果良好。据临江县五个区的统计，四个月接生九十五次，大人小孩均安全无恙。新培养的助产士和经过改造的旧产婆，已以其科学方法所获优良成绩，开始在群众中建立了威信。通化助产学校学员田心，以人工呼吸法救活了刘云章的假死的小孩，刘妻感激地说：“长了这么大年纪，从没见过这样慰贴的接小孩，再也不信生死由命的迷信话了。”
    辽东妇婴卫生工作的迅速开展，还是近两三个月来的事情。在这以前，中共辽东省委虽已明确提出妇婴卫生工作方针，但未引起各地的足够重视，忽视帮助妇女群众解决实际困难。据通化、临江等县几个典型村庄的调查，都有百分之三十至四十的婴儿，因接产不卫生或方法不科学而患各种病症死掉。本溪县田师夫区一个月中有八名妇女因难产致死。通化地委察觉到这一问题的严重程度后，首先办起助产学校，其他各县相继开办了训练班。去年八月中旬，通化地委又召开了各县妇委联席会，郑重地讨论了这个问题，并提出今后把妇女卫生工作当成经常工作之一，尽量举办妇婴卫生事业。由于通化地区部分县份开始摸到了一些经验，加上该省报纸的介绍推广，这一工作便很快引起全省各县领导上的重视，获得了今天的成绩。省人民政府卫生局及省妇联会，为在这一工作已初步开展的基础上加强领导，特于年前十二月末联合发出开展妇婴卫生工作的通知，要求在农村中更普遍的进行妇婴卫生教育。并以县为单位，以改造旧接产妇为主、培养新助产士为辅，继续开办接生训练班。条件尚不具备的地区，则组织巡回讲学班，以小组或炕头讲学方式，进行教育。
