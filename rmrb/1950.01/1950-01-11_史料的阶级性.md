    I. The Importance of Historical Materials

    "The most important task of historical science is to study and reveal the laws of production, the laws of development of productive forces and production relations, and the laws of socio-economic development."① To accomplish this task, it does not mean "replacing the systematic narration of history with abstract sociological formulas,"② nor does it mean "distorting historical facts, explaining them from today's point of view, instead of explaining them from the point of view of the conditions that produced the historical events."③ On the contrary, it means "narrating the most important events and facts, as well as the characteristics of historical figures, etc., in chronological order." "Only on this basis is it possible to correctly analyze and correctly summarize historical events."② Because "Marxism-Leninism is science, and science is honest learning." A scientific attitude "is an attitude of seeking truth from facts, and to do this, one must not rely on subjective imagination, not on enthusiasm, not on books, but on objective facts, 'detailed possession of materials', and draw correct conclusions from these facts and materials. This conclusion is not a mere enumeration of phenomena, nor is it a bombastic and empty article, but a scientific conclusion."④

    For example, we all say that Chiang Kai-shek is a public enemy of the people. This conclusion is based on the concrete facts of Chiang's assassination of revolutionary leader Tao Chengzhang during the Xinhai Revolution; his betrayal of the revolution in 1927; his slaughter of countless people and the loss of many territories such as Northeast China and Jehol during the ten years from 1927 to 1937; his collusion with Japanese imperialism and traitor Wang Jingwei, either openly or secretly, to undermine the people's resistance during the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan; and his betrayal of China's sovereignty to US imperialism and large-scale attacks on the Chinese people after the surrender of Japanese imperialism... We all say that only the Chinese proletariat can become the leading force in the Chinese revolution. This conclusion is based on the duality of the peasant class. In thousands of years of feudal history, peasants could strike at feudal rulers but could not overthrow the feudal system. The peasant class is the main driving force of the Chinese revolution, but it cannot lead the Chinese revolution to victory. The Chinese national bourgeoisie has innate weakness. In the revolutionary struggle over the past fifty years, they have shown wavering everywhere and compromised with the counter-revolution. They cannot and dare not unite the people of the whole country. They are also the driving force of the Chinese revolution, but they cannot lead the Chinese revolution to victory. The Chinese proletariat has been particularly resolute and thorough in the revolutionary struggle than any other class. In the past thirty years, they have led the Great Revolution of 1925-27, the Land Revolution of 1927-37, the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, and the People's Liberation War in recent years. They are indeed the vanguard of the Chinese revolution. They have put forward the correct program of revolutionary struggle and can unite the people of the whole country; and looking at the specific environment of the world and China, only the Chinese revolution led by the Chinese proletariat can win. Therefore, this conclusion is correct and has won the approval and support of the people of the whole country. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang "placed its political foundation on the compromise agreement of imperialism,"⑤ "the government is a yamen,"⑥ officials "are corrupt officials and local bullies,"⑦ the army "brings disaster to the country and harms the people,"⑧ "can only be regarded as bandits,"⑨ even though the bandits bragged about "the great leader Chiang Kai-shek" and other empty phrases, the Chinese people changed "Long live Chairman Chiang" to "Chiang Kai-shek Ten Thousand Taxes." Even within the Kuomintang, it was rumored that "Zhongzheng is not upright, and the President is dictatorial." The Qing government squeezed so much that "the people were in extreme distress,"⑩ which aroused the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement. Although the traitors clamored that "the holy emperors (referring to the Qing emperors) had deep benevolence" and the Taiping army was "cruel and brutal," (11) the Chinese people supported the Taiping army against the Qing government. The Taiping army was "eagerly welcomed by the people, and when the government army (Qing army) arrived, the markets were closed." The traitors lamented: "The people's hatred for the bandits (a derogatory term for the Taiping army) is false, and their support for the bandits is real, which is even more worrying!"(12)

    In short, only conclusions based on real materials are scientific and needed by the people; other empty phrases not based on concrete facts will certainly be spurned by the people. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us: "No investigation, no right to speak."(13) This principle, when applied to the study of history, means that without detailed possession of historical materials, one cannot study history. From this, we can see that historical materials are the most important thing in studying history.

    II. Historical Materials All Have Class Nature

    The scope of historical materials is very wide, including all books, newspapers, archives, letters, artworks, and inscriptions; from various objects to various legends, all traces left by class struggle and human struggle with nature are historical materials. How to collect, classify, examine, store, and use a large pile of complex historical materials are all things that people who study history should pay attention to, and the first thing that should be paid attention to is the class nature of historical materials.

    "The disintegration of the primitive commune and the beginning of the division of society into special classes which are, in the final analysis, mutually antagonistic." "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles," and this "is the whole history that has been handed down in writing."(14) All written historical materials are one of the weapons used by a certain class in the class struggle. There has never been such a thing as "super-class" in fact. Chiang Kai-shek's New Year's message in 1949 and Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation on January 14 are both historical materials, but they represent antagonistic classes. Chiang Kai-shek represented the interests of the landlord and comprador classes and proposed "peace" conditions to preserve the pseudo-constitution, the pseudo-legal system, the bandit gang's armed forces, and the traitorous treaties, etc.; Chairman Mao represented the interests of the Chinese people and proposed peace conditions to abolish the pseudo-constitution, the pseudo-legal system, the bandit gang's armed forces, and the traitorous treaties, etc. The so-called "super-class" news media also could not be super-class in reporting on these two documents. The United Press said: "The Chiang government is eager for peace,"(15) which is what Stuart Leideng "has been personally striving for in the past,"(16) obviously helping US imperialism and the Chiang bandit gang to deceive the Chinese people. The Dian Tong News Agency said: "The Kuomintang authorities are intensifying their peace offensive, hoping to use it to spread chaos in the Chinese liberated areas and swindle the Chinese people of their victory."(17) Exposing the conspiracy of Chiang and the US, it is obviously beneficial to the Chinese people. From this, we can see that all documents have class nature.

    Opening the books to see, the Twenty-Four Histories always praise the landlord class headed by the emperor from beginning to end, and slander the peasants and all working people. Zhang Xianzhong's army had strict discipline. He forbade soldiers from disturbing the local people. If anyone "disturbed the local people, the local scholars and people were allowed to lock them up and execute them in front of the army. Those who concealed and did not report them would be punished together."(18) The total population of China at the end of the Ming Dynasty was about 120 million.(19) However, the History of the Ming Dynasty said that Zhang Xianzhong "killed more than 600 million men and women."(20) It can be seen that the History of the Ming Dynasty completely represented the feudal landlord class to slander the peasant uprising army. Within the landlord class, there are differences between large landlords and small landlords, between those in the court and those in the opposition, and the struggle between groups formed by fellow villagers, clansmen, relatives, and factions. In their writings, they all exalt themselves and attack their enemies. For example, Xue Fucheng of the Zeng Guofan group attacked Zuo Zongtang in his book,(21) and Yu Ruyong of the Zhang Zhidong group attacked Li Hongzhang in his book.(22) They exposed each other, revealing some truths about their crimes. The landlord class squeezed the peasants together, and they also fought against each other. The old historical books are all in their hands, so the official history and unofficial history all slander the peasants in unison, and although their records have many differences, there is no "super-class" thing.

    Some of the objects were used in class struggles. For example, the ghost-headed broadsword displayed in the historical museum was a tool used by feudal rulers to slaughter the working people, and its class nature is very clear. Another part was used by human beings in the struggle against nature, and it is easy for people to blur its class nature. In class society, what people wear, eat, and all the tools used to fight against nature are all restricted by class relations. Misusing something of a higher level is called "transgression," which is a crime; using something of the emperor's is an even greater crime of "great disrespect," the sixth of the ten unpardonable crimes; misusing something of a lower level is called "losing face," and is ridiculed by people of the same class. How can you say that objects have no class nature? When you go to the Palace Museum and see a fan made of ivory, we cannot simply think that this is a tool for cooling off, but we should know how many people and how many days of labor this ivory fan cost the people. Because the emperor used a fan made of ivory, the peasants and all the working people could only use broken feather fans and broken banana leaf fans, or had no fans at all; they even ate grass roots and tree bark, and even starved to death. The extravagance and debauchery of the landlord class developed the manufacturing of luxury goods such as gold, jade, and enamel, but cruelly squeezed the peasants and all the handicraft workers, making the working people extremely poor and backward, unable to improve production tools and unable to improve production technology, which was destroying production and hindering social progress. The emperor's utensils such as ivory fans preserved in the Palace Museum today are the relics of the landlord class, and they are the true historical materials of the landlord class's exploitation of the peasants. Only by recognizing the class nature of objects can we use objects as historical materials and draw correct conclusions from them.

    Some Chinese legends, myths, stories, etc., were manufactured or transformed by the feudal ruling class. In order to maintain the feudal regime, they promoted "Heaven gives birth to the people and establishes rulers over them,"(23) and insisted that the primitive people "built nests to avoid the harm of insects," which was "taught by the sages"; "drilling wood to make fire and cooking raw meat," was because "a sage arose";(24) "making nets by tying ropes to hunt and fish," was also relying on "Bao Xi's reign over the world."(25) All the facts that the masses created history in labor were portrayed as the achievements of the "sages," proving that the "sages" were born rulers of the people. In order to protect the interests of their class, the landlord class always ridiculed the peasants in all the stories, even insulting the peasants. However, among the peasants, there were legends that exposed the crimes of the landlord class, satirized the landlord class, and resisted the landlord class. Only by recognizing the class nature of legends, myths, and stories, and stripping off the disguise of the reactionary class, can we adopt these historical materials.

    III. The People's Method of Handling Historical Materials

    The exploiting classes have always distorted history and obliterated the history of the working people. From Qin Shi Huang's burning of books and burying of scholars to the Qing Dynasty's compilation of the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, tampering, burning, and destroying Chinese old books, strictly ordering the destruction of the documents and relics of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, to Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang's prohibition of progressive books and newspapers, this is a consistent method of the counter-revolutionary class to eliminate historical materials. Therefore, the specific methods of Li Zicheng's "equalizing the land,"(26) Zhong Xiang and Yang Tai's "equalizing the rich and the poor,"(27) and the concrete facts that Huang Chao "raised troops for the people,"(28) are impossible for later generations to know in detail. After concealing the truth of history, the reactionary class fabricated history, saying that Huang Chao killed eight million people, etc., distorting the just struggle of peasants against exploitation in the past dynasties into peasants rebelling for the sake of killing people. Chiang Kai-shek implemented the policy of killing all, burning all, and looting all against the revolutionary people,(29) killing so many people in Huang'an County, Hubei Province that only a few people were left in a village of more than 170 households, but he piled up a tower of white bones and shamelessly propagandized that the Communist Party was killing people.(30) Obliteration, fabrication, distortion, this is a set of methods for the reactionary class to deal with historical materials.

    All exploiting classes, for the sake of their class interests, dare not tell the truth or dare not tell the whole truth. Chiang Kai-shek dared not say that Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng forced him to resist Japan in the Xi'an Incident, and he was released only after he admitted to uniting to resist Japan;(31) but he fabricated a Half-Month Record of Xi'an to deceive the people, in order to maintain the position and prestige of the "Chairman." The counter-revolutionary ruling class generally does not dare to tell the people the truth, but within their class, when discussing how to jointly squeeze the people, or when attacking each other, they sometimes tell part of the truth. For example, Nala (Empress Dowager Cixi) said to Li Hongzhang, Zhang Zhidong and others: "The uprising of the Boxers spread throughout the capital within a few months, and their numbers are no less than hundreds of thousands. If we suppress them, disaster will immediately arise under our arms, so we can only try to save the situation slowly."(32) She frankly explained that she changed the policy of suppression to a policy of utilization because the Boxer's forces were strong, but she wanted to eliminate the Boxers in the process of utilization. Although she told the truth in a secret occasion, she lied in a public occasion. When the Boxer's forces were strong, she said: "I treat the people like my own children, and the people treat me like heaven and earth," "with common hatred and enmity," to "fight the foreigners to the end,"(33) trying to win over the Boxers as much as possible. After betraying the Boxer's anti-imperialist movement, she said again: "This disaster was actually caused by the Boxers for no reason,"(34) "all because the princes and ministers condoned the Boxers," "it was not the intention of the imperial court,"(35) pushing the facts of using the Boxers away completely. Another example is Li Hongzhang pointing out that "Liu and Zhang have always been close to the British and Japanese,"(36) attacking Liu Kunyi and Zhang Zhidong as running dogs of British and Japanese imperialism, which is a true statement, but he dared not say that he was acting as a servant of Russian imperialism. He lied about the traitorous Sino-Russian Secret Treaty, saying that "it does not hinder China's sovereignty."(36) When we deal with historical materials, we can find the real historical traces in the contradictions between the words and deeds of the reactionary class and in the contradictions between factions.

    When a certain exploiting class historically showed its progressive role, it also grasped a part of the scientific truth and dared to tell a part of the truth when it fought against the old ruling class. For example, Tan Sitong during the Hundred Days' Reform, representing the enlightened landlords and wealthy merchants who wanted to transform into capitalists, represented the progressive class in China at that time. Scientific truth was in line with its class interests, so he dared to say: "At the beginning of the people's birth, there were no such things as rulers and subjects, so they were all people,"(37) this truth. However, landlords who transformed into capitalists were still exploiting classes after all, and what's more, he was originally a landlord? So he dared not demand complete democracy, but only hoped to get a little bit of civil rights, and even took a step back, advocating: "Even if we cannot promote civil rights, we should also give the gentry the right to discuss matters. If there is gentry power, there is no need for the name of parliament, but there is already the reality of parliament."(38) That is to say, as long as gentry like them have power, everything will be fine. His kind of democracy is not thorough, not real, that is, not scientific. Limited by the class, he dared not tell the whole truth. When we deal with this kind of historical material, we should clarify its class roots, accept the real part, and abandon the unreal part.

    The proletariat is different from all exploiting classes. It is the working masses, the undertaker of social production, the leader of the people's revolution, and the more it reveals scientific truth, the more honestly it speaks, the more it is supported by the people, and the easier it is to win revolutionary victory and achieve thorough class liberation. The class interests of the proletariat are completely consistent with scientific truth, so it dares to tell the whole truth. Exposing the crimes of feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucrat-capitalism is beneficial to the revolution, and the proletariat will naturally thoroughly expose it. There are so many crimes of feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucrat-capitalism that they cannot be finished, so why fabricate them? From the masses, to the masses. The proletariat is connected with the masses by flesh and blood. If it has shortcomings in its actions and policies, it can only correct them in front of the masses in order to win the support of the masses, otherwise it will be separated from the masses. Therefore, the proletariat and its party, the Communist Party, never cover up their mistakes. On the contrary, they carry out severe criticism and self-criticism, and naturally there are no facts that can be hidden. Therefore, the proletariat does not obliterate historical facts, does not fabricate "historical facts," does not distort historical facts, does not take out of context, does not rigidly fill in formulas, and does not guide the people to focus only on collecting antiques, only on personal life, and to be separated from the real struggle. The proletariat's method of handling historical materials is to seek truth from facts, not only to possess the materials in detail, but also to grasp the typical examples in a planned and conscious way, and to deal with the materials by the method of class analysis. This is an honest and scientific method, that is, the method of dialectical materialism and historical materialism.

    To handle historical materials and study history, truly grasp the methods of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, it is first necessary to correct the proletariat's stand. "Having the intention to seek truth from facts, and not having the intention to cater to the public,"④ the proletarian stand of serving the people wholeheartedly is firmly established, then we can not be blinded by the selfish and self-interested non-proletarian ideological consciousness, dare to honestly tell the truth, and master this scientific method.

    史料的阶级性
    荣孟源
            一、史料的重要
    “历史科学的最首要的任务，就是要研究和揭明生产的规律，生产力与生产关系发展的规律，社会经济发展的规律”①。要完成这个任务，并不是说：“以抽象的社会学的规式，代替了历史之有系统的讲述”②；更不是说：“曲解了历史的事实。从今天的观点上来说明它，而不是根据产生历史事变的这些条件的观点来说明它”③。恰恰相反，而是说：要“按照年代的次序，讲述最重要的事件和事实，以及历史人物的特点等”。“只有在这样的基础上，正确的分析和正确的总结历史事件，才有可能”②。因为“马列主义是科学，科学是老老实实的学问”。科学的态度，“就是实事求是的态度，而要这样做，就须不凭主观想像、不凭热情、不凭书本，而凭客观存在的事实，‘详细占有材料’，从这些事实中材料中引出正确的结论。这种结论，不是甲乙丙丁的现象罗列，也不是夸夸其谈的滥调文章，而是科学的结论”④。
    譬如说，我们都说蒋介石是人民公敌，这是根据蒋匪在辛亥革命时，刺死革命领袖陶成章；一九二七年叛卖革命；一九二七到三七年，十年间屠杀了无数人民，断送了东北、热河……等许多国土；八年抗日战争期间，与日本帝国主义及汉奸汪精卫或明或暗的勾结，破坏人民抗战；日本帝国主义投降以后，又把中国主权出卖给美帝国主义，大举攻击中国人民……等等罪行的具体事实而得出来的结论。我们都说只有中国无产阶级在中国革命中能成为领导的力量，这是根据：农民阶级是二重性的，在几千年封建历史中，农民能打击封建统治者，却不能推翻封建制度，农民阶级是中国革命的主要动力，却不能领导中国革命胜利。中国民族资产阶级具有先天的软弱性，近五十年来，他们在革命斗争中，处处表现了动摇，对反革命妥协，不能也不敢团结全国人民，他们也是中国革命的动力，却不能领导中国革命胜利。中国无产阶级在革命斗争中，比任何别的阶级来得特别坚决和特别彻底，近三十年来，他们领导了一九二五到二七年大革命，一九二七到三七年土地革命，八年抗日战争，与最近几年的人民解放战争，确是中国革命的先锋队，他们提出了正确的革命斗争纲领，能团结全国人民；再按世界的、中国的具体环境来看，也只有中国无产阶级领导的中国革命才能胜利，种种事实而得出来的结论。因此，这种结论是正确的，获得了全国人民的赞同和拥护。蒋介石匪帮，“把政治基础置于帝国主义的妥协协定之上”⑤；“政府是个衙门”⑥，官吏“是贪官污吏，土豪劣绅”⑦；军队“祸国殃民”⑧“只好视为土匪”⑨；匪徒们尽管自吹自擂“伟大的领袖蒋介石”等滥调，但是中国人民把“蒋委员长万岁”，改成了“蒋委员长万税”。连国民党内部也流传着：“中正不正，总裁独裁”的话。满清政府压榨得“百姓颠连困苦”⑩，激起太平天国革命运动，汉奸们尽管叫嚣，“列圣（指满清各皇帝）深厚之仁”，太平军是“残忍惨酷”（十一）等滥调，但是中国人民却是拥护太平军反对满清政府，太平军“至争迎之，官军（满清军）至皆罢市”，真逼得汉奸们哀鸣：百姓们“恨贼（污蔑太平军之称）者虚，资贼者实，尤为可虑！”（十二）。
    总之，只有根据真实材料得出来的结论，才是科学的，才是人民所需要的；此外不根据具体事实的滥调，一定为人民所唾弃。毛泽东同志指示我们说：“没有调查，就没有发言权。”（十三）这个原则用在研究历史上，就是没有详细占有历史材料，不能研究历史。由此可知研究历史，史料是最重要的。
            二、史料都有阶级性
    史料范围很广，一切书籍、报章、档案、信札、艺术品，以及金石等；从各种实物到各种传说，凡是阶级斗争、人类与自然斗争所遗留的痕迹，无一不是史料。大堆庞杂的史料，怎样搜集、分类、考订、保管、运用……等等，都是研究历史的人所应当注意的，而其中首先应当注意的，就是史料的阶级性。
    “原始的公社的瓦解，社会开始分裂为一些特殊的，归根结底互相对抗的阶级”。“一切至今存在过的社会的历史是阶级斗争的历史”，这“就是用文字传下来的全部历史”（十四）。一切文字的史料，都是某一阶级在阶级斗争中所用的武器之一，什么“超阶级”的东西，事实上从来没有。一九四九年元旦蒋介石的新年文告，一月十四日毛主席的关于时局的声明，这两个文件，都是史料，可是代表着敌对的阶级。蒋介石代表大地主，大买办阶级的利益，提出“和平”条件是保存伪宪法、伪法统、匪帮武装、和卖国条约等等；毛主席代表中国人民的利益，提出和平条件是废除伪宪法、伪法统、匪帮武装、和卖国条约等等。所谓“超阶级”的新闻界，对于这两个文件的报导，也并不能超阶级。合众社说：“蒋政府是渴望和平”（十五），这是司徒雷登“过去所一直亲自努力以求的东西”（十六），显然是帮助美帝国主义和蒋匪帮来欺骗中国人民。电通社说：“国民党当局加紧他们的和平攻势，他们希望借此在中国解放区散播混乱，并将中国人民的胜利骗去。”（十七）揭穿了蒋美的阴谋，显然对中国人民是有利的。由此可知，一切文献都有阶级性。
    翻开书本来看看，一部二十四史，从头到尾总是歌颂以皇帝为首的地主阶级，污蔑农民与一切劳动人民。张献忠军纪严明，他禁止士兵扰害地方，如有“扰害地方者，许彼地士民锁解军前正法，如容隐不举，一体连坐”（十八）；明末中国人口总数约为一万万二千余万口（十九）；而明史却说张献忠“杀男女六万万有奇”（二十），可知明史完全是代表封建地主阶级来污蔑农民起义军。地主阶级内部，有大地主小地主之不同，有在朝在野之区别，有因同乡、同族、亲戚、派系而分成的集团之斗争，他们在著作中都是抬高自己，打击敌人。如曾国藩集团的薛福成在书中攻击左宗棠（二十一），张之洞集团的于汝庸在书中攻击李鸿章（二十二）。他们互相揭发，暴露了他们的罪恶的某些真象。地主阶级一齐压榨农民，而他们又互相倾轧，旧史籍都掌他们手中，所以正史、野史都一致污蔑农民，而其记载虽有许多不同，却没有“超阶级”的东西。
    实物一部分是阶级斗争所用的，如历史博物馆中陈列的鬼头刀，是封建统治者屠杀劳动人民的工具，其阶级性非常明确。另有一部分是人类对自然斗争所用的，很容易被人模糊了它的阶级性。在阶级社会中，人们穿在身上，吃在肚里，一切用来与自然斗争的用具，没有一种不受阶级关系所限制。错用了高一级的东西，叫做“僭越”，那是犯罪的；用了皇帝的东西，更要犯十恶不赦第六项“大不敬”的大罪，错用了低一级的东西，叫做“失身份”，被同阶级的人诽笑，怎么能说实物没有阶级性呢。到故宫博物院中看到了一把象牙编成的扇子，我们不能简单的认为这是乘凉的工具，而应当知道，这一把象牙扇子耗费了人民多少人，多少天的劳动。因为皇帝用了象牙编的扇子，而使农民与一切劳动人民只能用破翎扇，破芭蕉扇，没有扇子用；甚而吃草根树皮，以至于饿死。地主阶级的骄奢淫佚，发展了金玉珐琅等奢侈品的制造业，却残酷地压榨农民与一切手工业工人，使劳动人民极端穷苦和极端落后，不能改善生产工具，不能提高生产技术，正破坏着生产，妨害着社会进步。现在故宫博物院所保存的象牙扇子等皇帝的用具，正是地主阶级的遗物，它是地主阶级压榨农民的真实史料。只有认识了实物的阶级性，才能用实物做为史料，才能从这里引出正确的结论。
    中国有些传说、神话、故事等等，是封建统治阶级所制造或改造过的东西。他们为了维持封建政体，宣传“天生民而树之君”（二十三），硬说原始人“结巢以避虫豸之害”，是“圣人教之”；“钻木取火，炮生为熟”，是因为“有圣人作”（二十四）；“结绳而为罔（网）罟，以佃以渔”，也是依靠着“包牺氏之王天下”（二十五）；把一切群众在劳动中创造历史的事实，都描绘成“圣人”的功绩，证明“圣人”是天生的人民统治者。地主阶级为了保护自己阶级的利益，在一切故事中总是嘲笑农民，以至污辱农民。而农民中间却流传着揭露地主阶级罪恶，讽刺地主阶级和反抗地主阶级的传说等等。我们认清了传说、神话、故事的阶级性，剥去其反动阶级所伪装上的外衣，才可以采用这一些史料。
            三、人民处理史料的方法
    剥削阶级向来是曲解历史，抹杀劳动人民的历史。从秦始皇焚书坑儒，到满清编四库全书，纂改、焚毁中国旧籍，严令销毁太平天国的文献遗物，直到蒋介石匪帮查禁进步书报，这是反革命阶级一贯的消灭史料的方法。因此，李自成“均田”（二十六）的具体办法，钟相、杨太“等贵贱、均贫富”（二十七）的具体办法，黄巢“起兵，本为百姓”（二十八）的具体事实，后人无法详细知道。反动阶级掩藏起历史真象以后，就来假造历史，说什么黄巢杀人八百万等等，把历代农民反抗压榨的正义的斗争，曲解成农民为杀人而造反。蒋介石对革命的人民，实行杀光、烧光、抢光政策（二十九），在湖北黄安县杀得一百七十多户的村庄，只剩下几个人，反而堆起白骨塔，无耻地宣传共产党杀人（三十）。抹煞、伪造、曲解，这是一套反动阶级处理史料的方法。
    一切剥削阶级，为了其阶级利益，不敢说真话或者不敢全部说真话。蒋介石不敢说西安事变，张学良、杨虎城强迫他抗日，他承认了团结抗日，才获得释放（三十一）；却假造一本西安半月记，来欺骗人民，借以维持“委员长”的地位和威信。反革命的统治阶级一般不敢向人民说真话，不过在其阶级内部，为了商议共同压榨人民，或互相攻击的时候，有时也说出一部分真话。如那拉氏（西太后）对李鸿章、张之洞等人说：“义和团民之起，数月之间，京城蔓延已遍，其众不下十数万，剿之即刻祸起肘腋，只合徐图挽救。”（三十二）直供不讳地说明，她因义和团势力强大才改变镇压政策为利用政策，而是要在利用中消灭义和团。在秘密的场合，她虽然说了真话，而在公开的场合，她却撒谎，当义和团力量大的时候，就说：“朕待百姓如赤子，百姓亦待朕如天地”，“同仇敌忾”，与洋人“一决雌雄”（三十三），尽量拉拢义和团。当叛卖了义和团反帝运动之后，她又说：“此次祸患，实由拳民无故肇端”（三十四），“皆因诸王大臣等纵庇拳匪”，“实非朝廷本意”（三十五），把利用义和团的事实推脱得干干净净。又如李鸿章指出“刘张素昵英日”（三十六），攻击刘坤一、张之洞是英日帝国主义的走狗，是一句真话，但是他不敢说自己充当沙俄帝国主义的奴才，他把卖国的中俄密约，却撒谎说：“并无碍中国主权”（三十六）。我们处理史料，在反动阶级的言行矛盾、派系矛盾中正好寻求真实的史迹。
    某一剥削阶级，当它在历史上表现其进步作用的时候，对旧统治阶级进行斗争，也曾掌握了一部分科学真理，敢说一部分真话。如戊戌变法时候的谭嗣同，代表着开明的地主富商要求转化为资本家，在当时是代表中国进步的阶级，科学真理符合其阶级利益，所以他敢说：“生民之初，本无所谓君臣，则皆民也”（三十七）这个真理。但是地主转化为资本家，毕竟还是剥削阶级，何况他原来就是地主呢？于是他不敢要求彻底的民主，仅仅希望得到一点点民权，甚至又退一步，主张：“即不能兴民权，亦当畀绅耆议事之权，夫苟有绅权，即不必有议院之名，已有议院之实矣。”（三十八）就是说，只要他们这样的绅耆有了权，那就万事大吉了。他这种民主，是不彻底的，不真实的，也就是不科学的。阶级所限制，他不敢全部说真话。我们处理这一种史料，应当弄清楚了其阶级根源，接受其真实的部分，抛弃其不真实的部分。
    无产阶级和一切剥削阶级不同，他是劳动群众，社会生产的担当者，人民革命的领导者，愈是揭明科学真理，愈是老老实实的说话，就愈受人民的拥护，愈容易争取革命胜利，获得彻底的阶级解放。无产阶级的阶级利益和科学真理完全一致，所以敢完全说真话。揭穿了封建主义、帝国主义、官僚资本主义的罪恶，对革命是有利的，无产阶级自然要彻底揭穿它。封建主义、帝国主义、官僚资本主义的罪恶多得很，说也说不完，又何必假造呢。从群众中来，到群众中去。无产阶级和群众血肉相连，自己如果在行动上，政策上发生了缺点，只有在群众面前纠正，才能取得群众的拥护，不然就会脱离群众。于是无产阶级与其政党——共产党，绝不掩饰自己的错误，相反的是进行严厉的批评与自我批评，自然没有可以隐藏的事实。因此，无产阶级不抹杀史实，不伪造“史实”，不曲解史实，不断章取义，不硬填公式，不引导着人民专注意收藏古董、专注意个人生活而脱离现实的斗争。无产阶级处理史料的方法是实事求是，不仅详细占有材料，而且是有计划的有意识的抓住典型，用阶级分析的方法处理材料。这是老老实实的科学方法，也就是辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的方法。
    处理史料，研究历史，真正掌握辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的方法，首先必要端正了无产阶级的立场。“有实事求是之意，无哗众取宠之心”④，全心全意为人民服务的无产阶级立场站稳了，那才能不为自私自利的非无产阶级的思想意识所蒙蔽，才敢坦白地说真话，才能掌握这种科学方法。
