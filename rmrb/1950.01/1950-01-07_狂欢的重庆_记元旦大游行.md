    Jubilant Chongqing
    A Record of the New Year's Day Parade
    On the first morning of 1950, five-star national flags were hung everywhere in the mountain city.
    Red flags guided the people's队伍 (dui wu) from the Gele Mountain area, from the south bank of the mighty Yangtze River, from the beautiful north bank of the Jialing River, and from all directions to the area around Shangqingsi Road and South District Park. The sides of the road were packed with people, the windows and rooftops were crowded with people, and piles of people gathered on the slopes, cliffs, and stone steps.
    At 11 a.m., the cultural troupe of the heroic troops who captured Chongqing, the "August 1st" broadcasting vehicle, the military band, and the waist drum team, surrounded by huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, passed through the streets. The citizens enthusiastically cheered and applauded these two 2-zhang-high portraits. The workers'队伍 (dui wu) arrived. The workers of the Twenty-First Arsenal, which suffered the most damage before the liberation of Chongqing, held high the banner with the slogan "Strive to Restore Production." Behind them, the miners of the Tianfu Coal Mine Company sang the labor songs that the boatmen on the Jialing River loved to sing, arm in arm, marching forward with great strides, showing the unparalleled strength of the working class.
    Then came the green-clad postal workers, the black-clad sailors, the yellow-clad telecommunications workers, and the white-clad nurses, as well as those who carried boats, pulled carts, carried water, and carried sedan chairs. The endless队伍 (dui wu) of the working masses all arrived. They laughed heartily. In the workers'队伍 (dui wu) were costumed portrayals of the four major war criminals Jiang, Song, Kong, and Chen in various embarrassing and ugly states. After the tens of thousands of workers had passed, the women's队伍 (dui wu) arrived. Impoverished women from the north bank of the Jialing River all participated in the ranks of the Democratic Women's Federation, holding their children. Industrialists, bankers, and shop owners also followed the队伍 (dui wu) in front, shouting slogans. Writers, poets, painters, and teachers also walked by, laughing.
    At this time, people felt that the parade was too long. The vanguard had passed by several hours ago, and the队伍 (dui wu) behind had not yet set off. Legs were numb and stomachs were hungry, but no one dropped out. Every unit held high portraits of Chairman Mao and marched forward. Never in Chinese history has anyone received such widespread respect from the people. Millions of people shouted in one voice: "Support Chairman Mao! Support the Central People's Government!" At 4 p.m., the student队伍 (dui wu) finally arrived. They are forever young and active. They could not forget the massacre by the Jiang bandits at the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" in Ciqikou. They shouted the slogan "Thoroughly Eliminate the Remnants of the Enemy" to the masses. Among the 120,000 people, there was also a队伍 (dui wu) of Tibetan residents in Chongqing. The leader, Sun Ge Badun, told reporters: "For many years, we have suffered from the oppression of the Jiang bandits' great Han chauvinism. Today we have truly returned to the embrace of the motherland." They cheerfully sang Tibetan folk songs while marching and shouted: "中華米里納楚基!" (According to the Tibetan language, it means: "Long live the unity of all Chinese nationalities!") [Xinhua News Agency]

    狂欢的重庆
    记元旦大游行
    一九五零年的第一个清晨，山城到处悬起五星国旗。
    红旗导引着人民的队伍从歌乐山区、从雄浑的长江的南岸、从美丽的嘉陵江北岸，从四方八面涌向上清寺路和南区公园一带。马路两旁站满了人，窗口、房顶拥满着人，坡边崖边、石梯上也聚立着一堆堆的人。
    上午十一时，攻克重庆的功臣部队的文工团、“八一”广播车、军乐队、腰鼓队簇拥着毛主席和朱总司令的巨像走过街道，市民们向着这两幅二丈高的巨像狂热地欢呼，不断地鼓掌。工人队伍来了。在重庆解放前遭受破坏最惨的二十一兵工厂的工人们高举着“努力恢复生产”的标语旗。后面，天府煤矿公司的矿工们高唱着嘉陵江上船夫们爱唱的劳动歌曲，手挽着手，大踏步前进，显示了工人阶级的无比力量。
    接着，绿衣服的邮工、黑衣服的海员、黄衣服的电信职工、白衣服的护士，还有搬船的、拉车的、挑水的、抬轿的，无穷尽的劳动大众的队伍通通来了。他们尽情欢笑。工人队伍中有化装的蒋、宋、孔、陈四大战犯作各种狼狈丑态。几万人的工人行列过去，妇女的队伍又来了，从嘉陵江北岸来的贫苦妇女都抱着小孩子参加在民主妇联的行列里。工业家、银行家、商店老板也随着前面的队伍，高呼着口号。作家、诗人、画家、教师也欢笑着走过了。
    这时，人们才感到游行队伍是太长了。前锋已过去几小时，后面还有队伍没动身，腿麻了，肚子也饿了，但没有一个人掉队。每个单位都高举着毛主席像前进，中国历史上从没有一个人受到这样广泛的人民的尊敬。千万人都喊出一个声音：“拥护毛主席！拥护中央人民政府！”下午四点钟，学生队伍终于来了，他们永远是年青活跃的，他们忘不了蒋匪在磁器口“中美合作所”的大屠杀，他们向群众呼出“彻底肃清残敌”的口号。在十二万人的行列中，还有一支旅渝藏民的队伍，领队的孙格巴顿对记者说：“许多年来，我们饱受着蒋匪大民族主义的压迫，今天我们才真正回到了祖国的怀抱。”他们在行进中愉快地唱着藏族的民歌，高呼：“中华米里纳楚基！”（按系藏语，意即中华各民族团结万岁）                                          【新华社】
