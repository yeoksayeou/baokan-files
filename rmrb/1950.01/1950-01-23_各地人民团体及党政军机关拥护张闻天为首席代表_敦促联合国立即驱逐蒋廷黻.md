Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 22nd: People's organizations and Party, government, and military organs in various places have successively expressed their opinions, unanimously supporting the Central People's Government's appointment of Zhang Wentian as the chief representative of China to the United Nations meetings, and urging the United Nations to immediately expel the illegal representatives of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang. The Northwest Military and Political Committee, currently holding a meeting in Xi'an, specifically issued a circular telegram to the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country regarding this matter. In the telegram to the Chairmen of the Central Government, it said: The first plenary meeting of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, representing 63 million people of all nationalities in the five provinces of the Northwest, firmly supports Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn declaration to the United Nations demanding that the illegal Jiang bandit delegation be expelled and that the legitimate Zhang Wentian delegation, dispatched by our Central People's Government and the only one capable of representing the Chinese people, attend the United Nations General Assembly and participate in its work; and expresses sincere gratitude to the Soviet Union and the delegations of various people's democratic countries for their great and just actions in supporting the Chinese people. We firmly believe that the just demands of the Chinese people, with the assistance of the socialist Soviet Union, various people's democratic countries, and the progressive people of the world, will surely overcome all the reactionary conspiracies of American imperialism and its followers, and achieve final victory. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions issued a written statement stating: "The working class of Northeast China, with class consciousness and strong patriotism, warmly supports Foreign Minister Zhou's note to the United Nations, demanding that the United Nations General Assembly and its Security Council immediately expel the shameless Jiang Tingfu and his so-called 'delegation', and that the delegation of the People's Republic of China attend the meeting and participate in the work. Any delay will only result in a decrease in the prestige of the United Nations General Assembly." The democratic parties in Shanghai also warmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. Chen Jianchen of the Shanghai-Nanjing Provisional Working Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang believes that Foreign Minister Zhou's previous statements fully represent the public opinion of the Chinese people. The spokesman for the Shanghai Branch of the China Democratic League said: We hope that the United Nations will respect the just demands of the Chinese people. The spokesman for the Shanghai branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy said that the United Nations should not keep the representative of the fleeing bandits in the Security Council, but should immediately expel them and quickly welcome Zhang Wentian, the true representative of the Chinese people, to attend the meeting. At the same time, workers, youth, students, women, industrial and commercial circles, and cultural and educational circles in Dalian, Jinzhou, Harbin, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuxi, Jinan, Qingdao, Wuhan, Nanchang, Changsha, Chongqing and other places have unanimously supported our government's note to the United Nations and thanked the Soviet Union and the representatives of the people's democratic countries for their just support at the United Nations. Huang Huoqing, representative of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions, said: "The working class of Tianjin firmly supports Foreign Minister Zhou's note and demands that our delegation headed by Zhang Wentian go to the United Nations as soon as possible to attend the meeting and participate in the work." The Qingdao Branch of the Science Workers' Representative Conference believes that once the representatives of the Chinese people are able to attend the United Nations meetings, it will greatly strengthen the world's forces for peace and democracy and severely打击(dǎjī -strike) the arrogant conspiracies of the warmongers.
