	The Light of the October Revolution Illuminates Uzbekistan
	The Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic is one of the six constituent republics of the Soviet Union in its Asian part. It was founded on January 17, 1925. It has a land area of 407,500 square kilometers and a population of over 6.3 million (1939 census), mostly Uzbeks, as well as Russians, Tajiks, and Karakalpaks. The Karakalpaks have established an autonomous republic within the Uzbek Socialist Republic. The capital of Uzbekistan is Tashkent, a major industrial and cultural center of the country, with a population of 585,000.

	Before the October Revolution, Uzbekistan was a colony of Tsarist Russia, and everything in the country was backward. The great October Revolution brought freedom and national independence to the people of Uzbekistan. Now, due to the implementation of Lenin and Stalin's national policies and the completion of the successive great Stalin Five-Year Plans, Uzbekistan has become an industrial country with a highly developed agriculture.

	Uzbekistan: The Soviet Cotton Production Base, Accounting for Two-Thirds of the Output
	Most of Uzbekistan's land consists of low mountain valleys—places most suitable for artificial irrigation. The total irrigable land in Uzbekistan is more than the total amount of land in all other republics of Soviet Central Asia combined. From 1924 to 1939—in fifteen years—a total of 300,000 hectares of land were irrigated. During the same period, 1,080 kilometers of irrigation canals were built, including the great Stalin Farkhana Canal, the Molotov Tashkent Canal, and the Northern Farkhad Canal. In 1937, state-owned and collective farms had a total of 21,500 tractors and 1,400 combine harvesters.

	Heavy Industry Extensively Developed, Culture and Education Making Leaps Forward
	Uzbekistan is the cotton production base of the entire Soviet Union, accounting for two-thirds of the total Soviet cotton production. According to 1941 statistics, the total cotton production was 1,718,000 tons. The main producing areas are the Fergana Valley and the Amu Darya lowlands. In addition to cotton, Uzbekistan's fertile deserts also produce rice, grapes, fruits, and silk. In areas without irrigation, animal husbandry is developed.

	The republic has industries that manufacture agricultural raw materials, such as cotton ginning plants, oil presses, and silk reeling mills, as well as many food industry enterprises. Currently, the republic's heavy industry is also developing extensively, such as agricultural machinery manufacturing, chemical industry, and oil and coal mining. In 1945, the total value of industrial output was 2.48 billion rubles, nine times higher than in 1913. In 1944, heavy industry accounted for 52% of the industrial output. During the Great Patriotic War, the industry of the Uzbek Republic experienced even greater development; new aircraft factories, tank factories, machine factories, and other factories were established; the first ferrous metallurgy factory in Central Asia—the Uzbek Metallurgical Factory—and the Farkhad Hydropower Station were built.

	Before the October Revolution, Uzbekistan's culture was very backward, with only 160 schools and less than 2% of the population literate. Now, there are more than 5,000 schools, with over one million children receiving education. Before the revolution, there were no institutions of higher learning; now, there are two universities, thirty-six higher specialized schools, and ninety-five technical schools, with a total of more than 30,000 students. In 1943, the Uzbek Academy of Sciences, uniting eighteen scientific research institutes, was established. According to recent statistics, the Uzbek Republic has 1,596 libraries, averaging one per village. The largest Uzbek National Library has a collection of 1.5 million volumes.

	During the Great Patriotic War, tens of thousands of Uzbek people participated in the fighting. Due to their heroic combat achievements, sixty-six were awarded the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union," and 70,000 received Soviet medals and orders. Uzbek workers, peasants, and intellectuals actively supported the motherland on the labor front, supplying large quantities of wool, cotton, grain, meat, strategic materials, and munitions.

	The New Five-Year Plan Guarantees Extensive Development of Economy and Culture
	After the war, the Stalin Five-Year Plan guaranteed more rapid and extensive development of the national economy and culture of the Uzbek Republic. It is estimated that the investment in the republic's national economy from 1946 to 1950 will reach 3.9 billion rubles. A large number of new factories and mining areas will be established and developed. Power stations will add 303,000 kilowatts of equipment.

	In 1950, in terms of industry, steel production will reach 86,000 tons, coal production will reach 1.13 million tons, oil 1,066,000 tons, phosphate fertilizer 300,000 tons, and cement 270,000 tons. Consumer goods will also increase, with cotton fabrics reaching 161 million meters, silk fabrics 14 million meters, and vegetable oil 173,000 tons.

	The new Five-Year Plan will greatly develop agriculture, especially cotton planting. The Soviet Council of Ministers has set a plan for Uzbekistan that extends beyond the goals set by the Five-Year Plan, hoping that they will increase cotton production to 2.4 million tons by 1953. The cotton fields, which were 815,000 hectares in 1946, will be increased to 1 million hectares by 1953, with a planned yield of 2.5 tons of cotton per hectare (the yield in 1938 was 1.64 tons per hectare). The collective farmers of Uzbekistan wrote to Stalin that they did not want to reach this goal by 1953, but to achieve it in 1950, the last year of the Five-Year Plan.

	"Lenin and Stalin Opened Our Eyes"
	Soviet patriotism greatly inspired the labor enthusiasm of the Uzbek people. An Uzbek soldier, Kalum Rakhmanov, who participated in the defense of Leningrad, once said: "Without the Soviet Union, there could be no free Uzbekistan. Lenin and Stalin opened our eyes and showed us the path to happiness. We will not hesitate to dedicate our entire lives to the cause of safeguarding the Soviet regime!"

### 走向繁荣的乌兹贝克

    走向繁荣的乌兹贝克
            十月革命的光芒，照亮了乌兹贝克
    乌兹贝克苏联埃社会主义共和国是苏联在亚洲部分的六个加盟共和国之一。她成立于一九二五年一月十七日。土地面积为四十万零七千五百平方公里；人口有六百三十多万人（一九三九年调查数字），大部为乌兹贝克人，另外尚有俄罗斯人、塔吉克人及喀拉喀尔巴阡人，喀拉喀尔巴阡人在乌兹贝克社会主义共和国内建立有自治共和国，乌兹贝克的首都是塔什干，是国家的大工业及文化中心，人口为五十八万五千人。
    乌兹贝克在十月革命以前，是沙皇俄国的殖民地，国内的一切都是落后的。伟大的十月革命给乌兹贝克的人民带来了自由和国家的独立。现在由于列宁、斯大林民族政策的实现，由于历次伟大的斯大林五年计划的完成，乌兹贝克已成为一有高度的发展农业的工业国家。
            苏联的棉产基地，产量占三分之二
    乌兹贝克的大部土地是低山谷——最适于人工灌溉的地方，全乌兹贝克可灌溉的土地比苏联的中亚细亚其他共和国的全部土地的总额还多。从一九二四到一九三九年—十五年中一共灌溉了三十万公顷土地。同期内灌溉运河建成达一○八○公里，其中有伟大斯大林法尔哈纳运河、莫洛托夫塔什干运河、北方法尔哈德运河等。一九三七年时，国营及集体农场共有拖拉机二万一千五百架、联合收割机一千四百架。
            重工业广泛发展，文化教育在跃进。
    乌兹贝克是全苏联的产棉基地，总产量占全苏联棉产的三分之二。据一九四一年统计：棉花总产量为一百七十一万八千吨。主要产区为菲尔刚流域和亚摩——达里亚低地。除了棉花之外乌兹贝克的沙漠沃地中还盛产着米、葡萄、水果和丝。在没有灌溉的地方则发展着牧畜业。
    共和国有制造农业原料的工业如弹花厂、榨油厂、缫丝厂等，以及许多食品工业企业。目前共和国的重工业也在广泛的发展，如农业机器制造业，化学工业和石油及煤的开采等。一九四五年工业总产量价值二十四亿八千万卢布，比一九一三年高了九倍。一九四四年重工业产量占工业产额中百分之五十二。在伟大的爱国战争期间，乌兹贝克共和国的工业得到了更大的发展；建立了新的飞机制造厂、坦克制造厂、机器制造厂以及其他工厂；建立了中亚细亚第一家黑色冶金工厂——乌兹贝克冶金工厂，和法尔哈德水力发电站。
    在十月革命前，乌兹贝克的文化非常落后，仅有一百六十所学校，识字的居民不足百分之二；现在已有学校五千多所，受教育的儿童有一百多万。在革命前，没有一所高等学校，现在已有二所大学，三十六所高等专门学校和九十五所技术学校，在这些学校里共有三万多学生。一九四三年创立了十八个科学研究所联合的乌兹贝克科学研究院。据最近统计，乌兹贝克共和国共有图书馆一千五百九十六所，平均每村一所。最大的乌兹贝克国立图书馆，藏书有一百五十万册之多。
    在伟大的爱国战争期间，成千成万乌兹贝克人民参加战斗，由于英勇奋战的功绩，六十六位获得“苏联英雄”的称号，七万人获得了苏联奖章及勋章。乌兹贝克的工人、农民及知识分子，在劳动前线上积极支援祖国，供应大量的毛、棉、谷物、肉类、战略物资及军火。
            新五年计划保证经济文化广泛发展
    战后，斯大林五年计划保证乌兹贝克共和国有更迅速更广泛的国民经济与文化的发展。预计：一九四六——五○年共和国国民经济投资达三十九亿卢布。大量新工厂及矿区将要建立及发展。电力站将增添三十万零三千千瓦的设备。
    一九五○年工业方面，钢产将达八万六千吨，煤产将达一百一十三万吨，石油一百零六万六千吨，磷矿肥料达三十万吨，水泥达二十七万吨。消费物资也将增加，棉织品将达一亿六千一百万米，丝织品一千四百万米，菜油十七万三千吨。
    新五年计划将使农业，特别是植棉，大大发展。苏联部长会议为乌兹贝克订出比五年计划规定目标更远年代的计划，希望他们作到于一九五三年棉产增至二千四百万吨。一九四六年棉田为八十一万五千海克脱至一九五三年棉田将增至一百万海克脱，计划每一海克脱产棉二点五吨（一九三八年每海克脱产量为一点六四吨）。乌兹贝克的集体农民写信给斯大林，他们不要到一九五三年才到达这个目标，而要于五年计划末尾一年——一九五○年达到它。
            “列宁斯大林打开了我们的眼睛”
    苏维埃爱国主义大大鼓舞了乌兹贝克人民的劳动热情。一个参加列宁格勒保卫战的乌兹贝克士兵喀鲁姆·拉克玛诺夫曾说过：“没有苏联，就不可能有自由的乌兹贝克。列宁、斯大林打开了我们的眼睛，使我们看见了幸福的道路。我们要不惜用全部生命献给维护苏维埃政权的事业！”
