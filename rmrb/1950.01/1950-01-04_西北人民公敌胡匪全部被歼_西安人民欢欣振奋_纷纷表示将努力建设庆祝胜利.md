Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 3rd—The news that the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated Hu Zongnan's bandit troops around Chengdu has brought immense joy to the people of Xi'an. They have expressed their feelings one after another. Zhao Zhankui, a famous worker and labor hero, said: Hu Zongnan's bandit gang is the greatest public enemy of the people in the Northwest. We workers are extremely happy that they have been completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army. In the future, our working class must unite as one and celebrate the great victory of the complete annihilation of the Hu bandits with practical actions to increase production. Qin Yongshu, director of the trade union of the Xi'an Telecommunications Bureau, said: The workers in Xi'an suffered the most from the oppression of the Hu bandits, and now we have finally vented our anger. Our telecommunications bureau workers must make telegrams and telephones more accurate and faster to celebrate this great achievement of the People's Liberation Army. Yang Buhao, a famous agricultural labor hero from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region who had just arrived in Xi'an from Yan'an, excitedly said: When the Hu bandits invaded Yan'an, they killed all the chickens, pigs, sheep, and cattle. The women and children of Yan'an hated them to the bone. Now that the Hu bandits have been wiped out, we must work hard to step up agricultural production in the rear. Yang Zilian, Secretary-General of the Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League, said: In order to celebrate the liberation of Chengdu and the complete annihilation of the Hu bandits by the People's Liberation Army, all members of the Northwest League must implement the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the China Democratic League, resolutely implement the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and support the central People's Government's fiscal budget and the People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds. Zhang Zifang, director of the Women's Federation of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, indignantly narrated the painful facts of the Hu bandits' trampling on women and children in the Northwest, and said that the People's Liberation Army's complete annihilation of the Hu bandits has avenged the people of the Northwest. Pan Yuanquan, director of the preparatory committee of the Xi'an Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: I remember that during the rule of the Hu bandits, there were more than 30 kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies, which made it impossible for the industrial and commercial circles to develop. Now, under the leadership of the People's Government, we will vigorously restore and develop industry and commerce. In the future, we will support the industrial and commercial policies of the People's Government, promote economic prosperity, and cooperate with the economic construction of the Great Northwest. Ma Dehan, a Hui representative to the Xi'an Municipal People's Representatives Conference, said: With the complete annihilation of the Hu bandits, we can be said to have had a very auspicious and prosperous New Year. In the future, the people of all ethnic groups in our Northwest should unite even more closely and, under the leadership of the Communist Party, jointly build the Great Northwest.

Also, the Masses Daily published an editorial on December 31st to celebrate the great victory of the complete annihilation of the Hu bandits. The editorial paid tribute to the field armies that won this victory and the migrant workers and people who supported the war.
