    Northeast State-Owned Coal Mines Train and Cultivate,
    Promoting 5,000 Staff and Worker Cadres
    The Experience Is: Gradual Promotion, Practical Assistance, Long-Term Planning, and Cautious but Bold Use.
    [Report from this Newspaper] Northeast News: Over the past three years, Northeast state-owned coal mines have trained and promoted 5,143 administrative and trade union cadres at all levels from among workers and staff. Among them, workers accounted for 83 percent, and staff accounted for 17 percent. Those promoted to trade union cadres accounted for 70 percent, and those promoted to administrative cadres accounted for 30 percent. In addition, eight mining areas have also trained more than 7,700 workers to become team and group leaders in production work, so the vast majority of previous team and group leaders have undergone re-election. These newly promoted worker cadres are all active elements, meritorious workers, and model laborers in production, possessing considerable political awareness, demonstrating a proactive and responsible attitude in their work, living a simple and hardworking life, going deep into the masses, and making rapid progress.
    The methods of training cadres are basically to educate them in staff and worker schools and training classes and to promote active elements to deputy positions from their work. After studying in staff and worker schools or training classes, they return to their original work posts, and are promoted when work requires it and after being recommended by the workers, so that they do not become divorced from the masses. The method of promoting deputy positions is as follows: administrative grassroots cadres are subjected to democratic deliberation and recommendation, and then appointed by the administration. Cadres promoted in this way are all supported by the masses. The method of cultivating deputy positions: mainly in actual work, to improve new cadres through various meetings, business studies and summary work. For example, in training production cadres, at the production meeting, first let them put forward their own specific opinions on problems and solutions, and then the leadership points out whether they are correct or not, and helps them to summarize. By doing this, the cadres progress faster.

    东北国营煤矿经过训练培养
    提拔五千职工干部
    经验是：逐级提升，切实帮助，长期打算，慎重大胆使用。
    【本报讯】东北消息：东北国营煤矿三年来从工人、职员中培养提拔了行政、工会各级干部五千一百四十三人。其中工人占百分之八十三，职员占百分之十七。提拔为工会干部的占百分之七十，为行政干部的占百分之三十。此外，八个矿区还培养了七千七百余工人成为生产工作中的班、组长，因而过去的班、组长绝大部分经过了改选。这些新提拔的工人干部都是生产中的积极分子、功臣和劳动模范，具有相当政治觉悟，在工作中表现积极负责，艰苦朴素，深入群众，进步很快。
    培养干部的方式，基本上是采取在职工学校、训练班中教育和从工作中提拔积极分子为副职的办法。他们在职工学校或训练班学习后仍回原工作岗位，工作需要时经工人推荐而提升，这样，使他们不致脱离群众。提拔副职的方法是：行政基层干部经过民主酝酿和推荐，再由行政委任。这样提拔的干部都是群众拥护的。培养副职的方法：主要在实际工作中，通过各种会议、业务学习及总结工作来提高新干部。如培养生产干部，在开生产会议时，首先让他们自己提出问题及解决问题的具体意见，领导上再指出正确与否，帮助他们作总结。这样作，干部进步较快。
