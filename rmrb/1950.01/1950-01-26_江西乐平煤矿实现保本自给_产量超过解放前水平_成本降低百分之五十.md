Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang. The state-owned Leping Coal Mine, one of the three major coal mining areas in Jiangxi, has basically achieved self-sufficiency at the break-even point due to increased output and reduced costs. The average monthly output of the mine in the six, seven, and eight months after liberation last year had already exceeded the pre-liberation level, and after September, it further broke through the level of 3,000 tons per month. The cost per ton of coal has been reduced by approximately 50 percent compared to the average of the first, second, and third months before liberation. The Leping Coal Mine was taken over by the People's Government on May 8 last year. Because it quickly solved the living difficulties of more than 1,000 employees and their families, a total of more than 4,000 people, it resumed production on the fourth day after the takeover. In order to achieve the goal of restoring and partially increasing production, the mine is currently formulating a production plan for 1950, promoting democracy, and improving management. The low-grade bituminous coal produced in Leping is rich in volatile components and high in oil content, making it a high-quality industrial coal in the Jiangnan region. The coal from the other two major coal mining areas in Jiangxi—Pingxiang and Tianhe—can be used for coking.

    江西乐平煤矿实现保本自给
    产量超过解放前水平
    成本降低百分之五十
    【新华社南昌电】江西三大煤矿区之一国营乐平煤矿因产量增加，成本减低，现已基本上做到保本自给。去年该矿解放后六、七、八三个月的平均月产量即已超过解放前水平，九月以后更突破了月产三千吨的水平。每吨煤的成本，较解放前一、二、三三个月平均降低约百分之五十。乐平煤矿是去年五月八日由人民政府接管的，由于迅速解决了一千多员工及其家属共四千多人的生活困难，于接管后的第四天即行复工生产。为达到恢复和部分增产的目的，该矿正在拟订一九五○年的生产计划，并发扬民主，改善管理。乐平所产低级烟煤，挥发成分多，含油量高，是江南优良的工业用煤。江西其他二大煤矿区——萍乡和天河的煤则可以炼焦。
