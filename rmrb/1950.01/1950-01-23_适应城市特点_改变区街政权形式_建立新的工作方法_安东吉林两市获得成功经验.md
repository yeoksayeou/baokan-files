Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 22nd: In order to adapt to the characteristics of urban population concentration and convenient transportation, and to establish new organizational forms and working methods suitable for urban governance, Andong and Jilin cities in Northeast China have adopted two different approaches, changing the organizational forms of district and street governance, and concentrating the deployment and implementation of policies, laws, and work tasks at the city level. Both cities have achieved relatively successful experiences in this regard.

Andong is a light industrial city with a smaller population, a foundation for public security work, and many people are already organized. Under these conditions, the city abolished district and street governments and public security sub-bureaus in early July last year, strengthened the public security work of the city's public security police stations, and concentrated municipal work in the municipal government. Before adopting this approach, the city had undergone two months of full discussion and deliberation. Initially, some cadres had ideological concerns. Some said: "Abolishing district and street governments will lead to chaos. Is it too risky?" However, after fully studying the specific conditions of Andong City, such as its small population and the foundation of its work, everyone finally believed that there would be no chaos after the abolition. Others said: "Who will do the work after the district and street governments are abolished?" After discussion, everyone agreed that municipal work would be handled centrally by the municipal government; public security work would be strengthened by the public security police stations; and trade union work would be organized by industry and directly led by the city's Federation of Trade Unions. In this way, not only would there be people to do the work, but it would also be strengthened. There were also different opinions on the tasks of the public security police stations. The municipal government advocated the integration of police and administration, with the police stations also managing the work of the former street offices that could not be concentrated in the municipal government. This approach essentially merged the work of the street offices into the police stations. This thinking reflected the municipal government's old view, that is, relying on district and street governments in the past, and now relying on police stations again. Finally, under the instructions of the provincial government, it was stipulated that the public security police stations should mainly do public security work. Their tasks were: (1) Maintaining public order and arresting counter-revolutionary criminals in the act; (2) Managing household registration and resident permits; (3) Protecting public facilities and state property; (4) Supervising public sanitation; (5) Mediating mass disputes; (6) Ensuring the implementation of government decrees. There were also two opinions on the leadership of the police station's work. The municipal government advocated dual leadership from the municipal civil affairs bureau and the public security bureau. Cadres of the public security bureau believed that dual leadership would disrupt the steps and leave the police stations at a loss. Therefore, it should be under the sole leadership of the public security bureau. Finally, it was decided to adopt the latter approach. Experience has proven that this approach is correct.

Jilin City is the fourth largest city in Northeast China and is also a heavy industrial city. After thorough deliberation and discussion, the city also abolished the original district and street governments and district public security sub-bureaus in July last year, strengthened the work of the public security police stations, and at the same time, based on the situation of Jilin being a large city, established district public offices as agencies dispatched by the city level to carry out certain municipal work designated by the municipal government, assist the municipal government in understanding the situation in each district, and prepare for future reorganization into district people's governments with limited powers through district people's representative conferences when necessary. During the process of change, due to some temporary chaos caused by the transition between the old and the new, some cadres wavered about changing the district and street organizations. Some felt that they had no "legs" in their work, no head to grab, and no one to do the work that was deployed, and therefore advocated restoring the street offices. Others saw these temporary chaos and that large cities such as Shenyang had not changed, and therefore doubted the change. The city's leading organs convened several symposiums and two cadre meetings to study the new problems arising after the transition and their solutions, and affirmed that the transition was basically correct and had achieved results. Finally, everyone had a unified understanding.

Four Achievements: (1) Unified and centralized leadership, easy implementation of policies and decrees, simplified procedures; (2) Work shifted to factories and financial departments; (3) Strengthened public security; (4) Unified trade union organization, strengthened leadership over workers.

After abolishing district and street governments, both cities achieved the following four achievements: (1) The implementation of policies and laws was concentrated at the city level, strengthening the unified and centralized leadership, making it easier to implement policies and laws, and reducing levels and simplifying procedures. For example, labor-capital disputes in Andong City were handled uniformly by the municipal labor bureau, which improved the shortcomings of the past, where district and street trade unions each acted on their own, their methods of handling were inconsistent, and deviations occurred in the implementation of policies. The industrial and commercial reasons were the responsibility of the municipal bureau of industry and commerce, so the standards could be unified. The work of military families was the responsibility of the municipal civil affairs bureau, so poor military families were quickly rescued. Health fees, water fees, and rent were collected directly by the municipal finance bureau and the construction bureau, saving time and procedures. In the past, reporting household registration, obtaining bail, and obtaining travel permits had to go through group leaders, street chiefs, police stations, and sub-bureaus, which was complicated and took a long time. Now, it can be solved with just one procedure. In the past, it took two days each time to complete procedures for household registration transfer and birth registration in Jilin City, but now it can be done immediately, taking up to two hours at most. The Yuhua Paper Mill and Match Factory in the city unanimously stated at the symposium: "The abolition of the street government has reduced the trouble", "No street government is better than having one." At the same time, this also strengthened the connection between the municipal government and the masses, and initially overcame the municipal government's leadership's red tape and bureaucracy. (2) The city's leading organs were freed from the complicated affairs of districts and streets, and the focus of work shifted from districts and streets to factories and enterprises, from the poor to the working class, and a large number of cadres were drawn to strengthen the work of factories and financial departments. (3) In terms of public security work, Andong City abolished the district and street governments, transferred 93 street cadres to strengthen the work of 26 police stations, and more closely connected the public security organs with the masses. At the same time, the public security bureau also transferred cadres from the original district public security sub-bureaus to strengthen industrial and mining security work, and organized the previously dispersed guard armed forces into a powerful mobile public security brigade, stationed in three important areas of the city, ready to act in case of emergency, and organized a patrol network, making public security work stronger than before. (4) In terms of trade union organization, Andong City, in order to adapt to the changes in the form of government organization, abolished the trade union branches, district, and street laborers' unions, formed four types of trade unions according to industry, and directly led by the city's Federation of Trade Unions, thus unifying the trade union organization and strengthening the leadership over workers in public and private industries. It has played a great role in promoting the conclusion of labor-capital collective contracts, the implementation of management democratization in public factories, and the movement to create new production records.

Solutions for the Transitional Period

However, after the abolition of district and street governments, both cities went through a period of transition between the old and the new. The old organizations and systems have changed, but the new systems and methods are not yet complete and have not yet become a habit, which particularly affects the connection between the municipal government and the masses. For example, after the abolition of district and street governments in Andong City, the connection with the people's representatives was very insufficient. It did not hold symposiums in various industries in between the two people's representative conferences to listen to opinions, study problems, and promote work in a timely manner. At the same time, the connection with the people's organizations was also insufficient, so it was not possible to understand the situation below in a timely manner. In addition, after the abolition of district and street governments, the organization and education of urban poor people, street women, workers' families, and industrial and commercial operators were also relaxed. In Jilin City, some public welfare work was temporarily left unattended. Now the Andong Municipal Government has planned to take the following two measures to solve these problems: (1) Strengthen the system of people's representative conferences and make full use of people's representative conferences. In between the two people's representative conferences, hold representative conferences or small symposiums of different industries to frequently and closely contact the masses, understand the situation, and deploy work. (2) Strengthen the organizational education of workers, working people, poor people, women, workers' families, and industrial and commercial operators in districts and streets. In addition to strengthening the trade unions in various industries and organizing the broad masses through trade unions and cooperatives, strengthen the work of cultural centers to carry out propaganda and education for the urban masses and improve their ideological awareness and political consciousness. At the same time, understand the situation, solve problems, and strengthen management through these organizations in a timely manner. In addition to adopting similar measures as mentioned above, Jilin City has also restored and improved the mass hygiene, preferential treatment, and other committees in the streets that do not break away from production, which are guided by the police stations and are responsible for general public welfare matters.

### 适应城市特点  改变区街政权形式  建立新的工作方法  安东吉林两市获得成功经验

    适应城市特点
    改变区街政权形式
    建立新的工作方法
    安东吉林两市获得成功经验  
    【新华社北京二十二日电】为了适应城市人口集中及交通方便等特点，建立适合于城市政权的新组织形式与新工作方法，东北安东、吉林两市采取两种不同的做法，改变了区、街政权组织形式，把政策法令与工作任务的布置与贯彻执行集中于市一级。两市在这都获得了比较成功的经验。
    安东是一个轻工业城市，人口较少，治安工作有基础，群众很多已组织起来。在这些条件下，该市于去年七月初旬取消了区、街政府及公安分局，加强市公安局派出所的治安工作，市政工作集中于市政府办理。在采取这一做法前，该市曾经过两个月的充分讨论和酝酿。开始部分干部在思想上还有顾虑。有人说：“取消区、街政府要发生混乱现象，是否太冒险？”但是大家充分研究了安东市的具体条件，如人口较少，工作有基础等，最后认为取消后不会混乱。又有人说：“区、街政府取消后工作谁来做？”经过讨论后，大家认为：市政工作集中市政府办理；治安工作则加强公安派出所；工会工作则按行业成立工会，由市总工会直接领导；这样一来，各项工作不只有人做，而且还加强了。对公安派出所的任务，也有不同的意见。市政府主张警政合一，派出所兼管原街公所不能集中于市政府的工作。这种办法实际上是把街公所的工作归并到派出所去。这种思想表示了市政府的旧观点，即过去依靠区街政府，现在又要依靠派出所。最后经过省政府的指示，规定公安派出所主要地是做治安工作，它的任务是：（一）维持治安，逮捕反革命现行犯；（二）管理户口、居民证；（三）保护公共设施和国家财产；（四）督导公共清洁卫生工作；（五）调解群众纠纷；（六）保证政府法令的执行。对于派出所工作的领导问题，也有两种意见，市政府主张受市民政局和公安局双重领导，公安局干部认为双重领导，将紊乱步骤，使派出所无所适从，因此应由公安局单一领导。最后决定采取后一办法。经验证明，这一办法是正确的。
    吉林市是东北的第四座大城，而且是一个重工业城市。该市也在经过充分的酝酿与讨论后，于去年七月取消了原有的区、街政府及区公安分局，加强公安派出所的工作，同时，根据吉林是一个大城市的情况，另设区公所，作为市一级派出的办事机关，执行市政府所指定的某些市政工作，协助市政府了解各区情况，并准备将来在必要时经过区人民代表会议改组为职权不过大的区人民政府。在改变过程中，由于某些新旧不接的暂时的紊乱现象，某些干部对改变区街组织发生了动摇。有的人感觉在工作上没有个“腿”，没抓头，布置下去的工作没有人做，因而主张恢复街公所。有的人看到这些暂时的紊乱现象，又看到沈阳等大城市未变，因而对改变发生怀疑。经市领导机关召开了多次座谈会及两次干部会，研究了转变后产生的新问题及其解决办法，肯定这次转变基本上是正确的而且是有成绩的。最后大家有了一致的认识。
    四个成绩：（一）领导统一集中，政令容易贯彻，手续简化；（二）工作转向工厂财经部门；（三）治安加强；（四）统一工会组织，加强对工人领导。
    两市在取消了区街政府后，都获得以下四个成绩：（一）政策法令的执行集中于市一级，加强了领导的统一集中，使政策法令容易贯彻，并减少了层次，简化了手续。如安东市的劳资纠纷统一由市府劳动局处理，改善了过去区、街工会各自为政，处理方法不一致，执行政策上发生偏差的缺点。工管商理由市工商局负责，因而标准能够统一。军人家属工作由市民政局负责，使贫苦军属很快得到救济。卫生费、水道费、房租等由市财政局和建设局直接收取，节省了时间和手续。过去报户口、取保、领旅行证等，要经过小组长、街长、派出所、分局等，手续繁复，时间拖得很长，现在只要一道手续便可解决。吉林市过去办理户口迁移和出生等手续，每次要用两天时间，现在随到随办，至多只要两小时。该市裕华纸厂及火柴厂职工座谈会上一致认为：“街政府取消，麻烦减少了”，“没有街政府，比有强”。同时，这样做还加强了市政府与群众的联系，初步克服了市政府领导上的文牍主义与官僚主义。（二）解除了市领导机关忙于区、街的繁琐事务，工作重点由区、街转向工厂企业部门，由贫民转向工人阶级，抽出大批干部加强工厂及财经部门工作。（三）在治安工作方面，安东市由于取消了区街政府，抽调出九十三名街干部，加强了二十六个派出所的工作，更密切了公安机关与群众的联系。同时，公安局又抽调了原区公安分局的干部，加强工矿保卫工作，将过去分散的警卫武装编为有力的机动的公安大队，分驻市内三个重要地区，有事即行出动，并组织巡逻网，治安工作比以前更强了。（四）在工会组织方面，安东市因适应政权组织形式的改变，取消了工会的分会、区及街道劳动者联合会，按行业组成四种工会，由市总工会直接领导，因而统一了工会组织，加强了对公私产业工人的领导。在订立劳资集体合同、公营工厂中实行管理民主化和创造生产新纪录运动等方面，都起了很大的推动作用。
            过渡时期的解决办法
    但是在区、街政府取消后，两市都经过了一度新旧不接的时期。旧的组织和制度改变了，新的制度和办法还不周全，也还未成为习惯，因此特别影响到市政府与群众的联系。如安东市在区、街政府取消后，对于人民代表的联系非常不够，没有在两次人民代表会中间召开各业的座谈会，及时听取意见，研究问题，推动工作，同时对于人民团体的联系也不够，因此不能及时了解下情。此外，在取消了区街政府后，对城市贫民、街道妇女、工人家属、工商业者的组织及教育工作也放松了。吉林市并发生有些公益工作一时无人作。现安东市政府已计划采取以下两个办法来解决这些问题：（一）加强人民代表会议制度，充分运用人民代表会议。在两次人民代表会议之间，分别召开不同行业的代表会议或小型座谈会，以便经常密切联系群众，了解情况，布置工作。（二）加强区街工人、劳动群众、贫民、妇女、工人家属及工商业者的组织教育工作。除了加强各行业工会和通过行业工会及合作社将广大群众组织起来外，并加强文化馆的工作，进行城市群众的宣传教育，提高他们的思想意识及政治觉悟。同时经过这些组织及时了解情况，解决问题，加强管理。吉林市除已采取上述相似办法外，并恢复和健全了街道中群众性不脱离生产的卫生、优抚等委员，由派出所指导，负责一般公益事宜。
