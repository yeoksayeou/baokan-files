Severely Punish Profiteers!
Tian Liting and Others Guilty of Speculation and Profiteering – Sentenced to Labor and Fined

[Beijing News] The Military Tribunal of the Beijing Military Control Commission has sentenced three cloth merchant profiteers, Tian Liting, Liu Fuchen, and Liu Zhiyuan, to fixed-term labor and fines for speculation, profiteering, and illegal business operations. The profiteer Tian Liting, who is addicted to opium, owns the Lizengxiang Native Cloth Shop at No. 18 Nanbu Alley. He specializes in “internal” (内字号) transactions, not selling at the front counter. He frequently engages in various illegal operations of speculation and profiteering. He once forged a fake trademark of the pseudo-China Textile Company (伪中纺公司) to sell counterfeit cloth and falsely reported his capital at more than double the actual amount. Previously, he was discovered by the tax bureau and punished for hiding more than 1,000 bolts of cloth in a secret room in an attempt to evade taxes and for setting up black accounts and failing to affix stamp duties. However, he has shown no remorse. Recently, it was discovered that his accounts showed 183 bolts of cloth belonging to customers, while only 100 bolts were actually in storage, indicating an intention to engage in a disguised form of speculation. He also traded in gold and silver, disrupting the financial market, and his accounts show a balance of 40 silver dollars and 1 tael and 2 qian and 2 fen of gold. He was sentenced to six months of labor, suspended for two years, and fined 10 million yuan. He was also ordered to confess his crimes at a merchants' meeting. His three sets of forged trademark printing plates, totaling 14 pieces, were confiscated, and the stored gold and silver were converted at a depreciation rate of 30%. The profiteer Liu Fuchen, the manager of Yongzengchang Silk and Cloth Shop, engaged in "internal" transactions, not selling at the front counter. He forged seals and issued false invoices in an attempt to evade state taxes and engaged in short selling and speculation to obtain cotton yarn cloth from the China Cotton Yarn Cloth Company. He was sentenced to five months of labor, suspended for one year, and fined 3 million yuan. He was also ordered to confess his crimes at a merchants' meeting, and his six forged seals were confiscated. The profiteer Liu Zhiyuan, who jointly opened the Delong Cloth Shop at No. 4, First Lane, Tianqiao, reported the business as closed in August last year due to tax evasion and labor-capital disputes. In September, the business was changed to a stall, repeatedly falsely reporting capital, hoarding cloth, using fake trademarks, and setting up black accounts in an attempt to evade state taxes. He was sentenced to three months of labor, suspended for one year, and fined 4 million yuan. He was also ordered to confess his crimes at a merchants' meeting, and 75 fake trademarks were confiscated.
