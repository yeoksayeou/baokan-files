    Endorsing the Beijing Military Control Commission's Recovery of Barracks Real Estate
    Chinese Scientific Workers Association Issues Declaration

    [Beijing News] The Chinese Scientific Workers Association issued a declaration endorsing the Beijing Military Control Commission's recovery of the former American, French, and Dutch barracks real estate in Dongjiaomin Lane. The declaration stated:

    The Beijing Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a proclamation on January 6th, recovering the former American, French, and Dutch barracks real estate in the city. This is the Chinese People's Government resolutely implementing the Common Program adopted by the CPPCC, fully in line with the wishes of the Chinese people, and truly representing the interests of the Chinese people. We express our warm support for the Beijing Military Control Commission's just act of safeguarding Chinese sovereignty.

    For over a hundred years, imperialist countries, colluding with domestic reactionaries, have harmed Chinese sovereignty, oppressed the Chinese people, defrauded and extorted, committing all kinds of evils. The most vicious of these was the so-called "right to station troops" based on the Boxer Protocol, blatantly building barracks and stationing heavy troops in Beijing. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries also clamored all day long about "abolishing unequal treaties," but not only were the privileges of imperialist countries not touched in the slightest, but they also damaged our sovereignty and humiliated our nation even more than before. The Chinese people only felt more resentment towards the imperialist countries' disregard for the will of the Chinese people and the Kuomintang reactionaries' fawning on foreigners and serving the enemy.

    But the Chinese people have finally stood up strong. The Chinese people have not only overthrown the domestic feudal reactionary forces, but are also determined to kick the imperialist forces out of China. The Chinese people will never allow even a trace of imperialist privilege to remain in the new China. The "right to station troops" based on unequal treaties must be abolished, and the barracks real estate must be recovered. This is a matter of course. Property belonging to the Chinese people should be returned to the Chinese people!

    After the Beijing Military Control Commission issued the order to recover the American, Dutch, and French barracks real estate, the US State Department still tried to quibble and slander. This only exposed the ugly face of imperialism. As for the American imperialist reactionaries even threatening us, saying they "will withdraw all American official personnel from Communist China," then withdraw! Let all imperialist forces get out of China! The Chinese people, in upholding their own interests and defending the sovereignty of their people's motherland, never consider the will of any imperialists.

    拥护京军管会收回兵营地产
    中国科学工作者协会发表宣言
    【北京讯】中国科学工作者协会发表拥护北京军管会收回东交民巷前美、法、荷兵营地产的宣言，内称：
    中国人民解放军北京市军事管制委员会于一月六日发出布告，收回市内前美、法、荷等国兵营地产。这是中国人民政府坚决执行政协所通过的共同纲领，是完全符合中国人民的愿望，真正代表中国人民的利益。我们对北京市军管会为维护中国主权这一正义之举，表示热烈的拥护。
    一百多年来，帝国主义国家勾结我国内反动派，损害中国主权，压迫中国人民，欺诈勒索，无恶不作，而以根据辛丑条约的所谓“驻兵权”、公然在北京建筑兵营驻扎重兵为最毒辣。过去国民党反动派也整天叫嚣着要“废除不平等条约，但帝国主义国家的特权不但丝毫未动，反而损权辱国，甚于以往。对于帝国主义国家无视中国人民的意志和国民党反动派的媚外事敌，只有使中国人民更增加愤恨罢了。
    但是中国人民终于坚强地站起来了。中国人民不但推翻了国内的封建反动势力，并且一定要把帝国主义的势力踢出中国去。中国人民决不容许帝国主义还有一丝一毫的特权在新中国存留着。根据不平等条约的“驻兵权”必须取消，兵营地产必须收回，这是天经地义的事。属于中国人民的财产，应该归还中国人民！
    在北京市军管会发出收回美、荷、法兵营地产后，美国国务院还想狡辩诬赖。这徒然暴露帝国主义狰狞的面目罢了。至于美帝国主义反动分子竟想威胁我们，说什么“就要从共产党中国撤退所有美国官方人员”。撤退罢！一切帝国主义势力都滚出中国罢！中国人民在维护自己的利益以及保卫自己人民祖国的主权的立场上，是从不考虑一切帝国主义的意志的。
