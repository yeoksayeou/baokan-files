Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th. Yang Buhao, a special-class labor hero of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, arrived in Xi'an from Yan'an in December last year, preparing to visit Chairman Mao in person in Beijing. He intended to report on the production situation in the border region over the past year. He also carried 14 jin of honeycomb, 3 sheng of melon seeds, and a letter and production report to Chairman Mao from all the people of the Sixth Township of Chuankou District, Yan'an County, as gifts. When he arrived in Xi'an, Chairman Mao had already left for the Soviet Union, so his wish could not be fulfilled. Yang Buhao said: Chairman Mao is the lucky star of the people. He lived in Yan'an for more than ten years and personally led the people of the border region to turn themselves around. The people have a deep affection for him. We remember him all the time. We miss him very much when we have not seen him for a long time. Yang Buhao also repeatedly instructed relevant comrades of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government to forward the things he brought to Chairman Mao in Beijing to express the people's sentiments. The letter from all the people of the township to Chairman Mao said: Respected Chairman Mao: Thanks to your wise leadership, the bandit Hu was quickly eliminated, enabling us to develop production peacefully and return to a life of abundance. In the past year, the people of our township have cultivated the land deeply and carefully, reclaimed more than 3,000 mu of wasteland, and organized more than 70% of the township's labor force to participate in mutual aid, increasing grain production by more than 700 dan, restoring agricultural production to 90% of its pre-war level. In the future, we are willing to redouble our efforts to increase production and build a brand-new countryside in accordance with your instructions.

    劳动英雄杨步浩送礼问候毛主席
    【新华社西安九日电】陕甘宁边区特等劳动英雄杨步浩，于去年十二月间由延安赶到西安，准备亲到北京看望毛主席，报告边区一年来的生产情况，同时携带蜂糖十四斤、瓜子三升及延安县川口区第六乡全乡人民写给毛主席的信和生产报告作为献礼。当他到达西安时，毛主席适赴苏联，致未能如愿。杨步浩说：毛主席是人民的福星，他在延安住了十多年，亲手领导边区人民翻了身，人民和他有着深厚的感情，我们时时刻刻记着他，多时不见，实在想念的厉害。杨步浩并再三嘱托陕甘宁边区政府有关同志，务将他所带来的东西，转送北京毛主席，以表人民的心意。全乡人民写给毛主席的信中说：敬爱的毛主席：由于你英明领导的结果，迅速消灭了胡匪，使我们能安然发展生产，重新回到丰衣足食的日子。一年来，我乡人民深耕细作，开荒三千余亩，组织全乡劳力百分之七十以上参加变工，共增产粮食七百余石，使农业生产，恢复到战前百分之九十。今后愿加倍努力，提高生产，遵照你的指示，建设崭新的农村。
