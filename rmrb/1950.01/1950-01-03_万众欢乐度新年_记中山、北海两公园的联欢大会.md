The sound of joyful drums, songs, and laughter melted the frozen air into a spring-like atmosphere, enveloping Zhongshan Park. Under the sunlight, with a bang of a cannon, revolutionary staff members in gray and green uniforms, students and workers in red, blue, and black coats, each holding a dry branch, searched for "reactionaries" by the small hill, at the corners of the pavilion, and by the pond, turning over stones, pulling branches, and clearing dry grass. Suddenly, there was a girl's cheer here and a burst of boys' laughter there. One by one, "reactionaries"—paper slips with ugly portraits of war criminals like Chiang Kai-shek—hidden in stone crevices and under tree bark, were found. In front of the award platform, groups of "meritorious individuals" who had found reactionaries crowded together.

	Waves of gongs and drums, waves of laughter, collective dances and games were taking place simultaneously in over forty locations. Students invited visitors to join in while performing. Some young shop assistants naturally and happily sang "Unity is Strength" with the students.

	In the waterside pavilion, the photos of the Beijing student movement showed the students singing "Unity is Strength" under the surveillance of Kuomintang agents and police to protect themselves. An eleven or twelve-year-old child screamed in horror when he saw the bloody photos of the four martyrs who sacrificed in the Kunming "December 1st" tragedy. But outside the window, "The Sky in the Liberated Area" and "March of the Motherland" were sounding. The child ran out, immediately forgot everything, and happily sang along loudly.

	In the Concert Hall, workers and students were performing songs and dances, while in Zhongshan Hall, Beijing artists were performing new folk arts. On the square in front of Zhongshan Hall, colorful red and green silks were flying, and the amplified "Turning-Over Ballad" was being broadcast. Workers who had been liberated for less than a year sang, "Pave the destroyed roads, ignite the roaring boilers," "The front and rear support each other, the victory of the whole country is in sight." They sang four-part harmonies, three-part harmonies, and unison songs with great strength and harmony. Workers from the clothing factory sang self-composed songs such as "Celebrating the New Year" and "Buying Government Bonds"; workers from the Beijing-Tianjin Railway Bureau performed a waist drum dance they had rehearsed themselves. Their strong hands beat the small red drums, just as they skillfully operated their machines.

	The large choir of nearly two hundred people from the Second Boys' Middle School and the Fourth Girls' Middle School sang songs from the September 18th Incident to the victory of the Liberation War. They sang the passionate "March of the Volunteers," the desolate "Songhua River," the majestic "March of the Eighth Route Army," the agile "We Are All Sharpshooters," the satirical "The Chiang Bandit Gang is a Mess," and the brisk "March of the Field Army." When they sang "The Red Flag is Flying," a row of red flags suddenly rose behind rows of blue-black uniforms. The song stirred the emotions of the entire audience, leading people step by step from the past to the present. When they sang about Chairman Mao, a giant portrait of Chairman Mao rose high, and people applauded warmly with gratitude and love.

	The ice sports meet in Beihai was a wonderful event. It no longer focused on the personal skills of "reverse figure eights" and "average movement" of previous years, but had many new collective creations. For example, the "Forward-Backward Glide" for two people and the "Dragon Pulling" competition for ten people, all promoted collective cooperation. Datong Middle School performed "Dropping Burdens to Enter the Door of Marxism-Leninism." The North China Electric Power Company's performances of "The Great Unity of the Chinese People," "Not Afraid of the Atomic Bomb," "Seeing Through the White Paper," and "Crushing Imperialism" were all new programs with strong political content. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' creation, "Leaning to One Side," received unanimous praise. The plot was: At the beginning, the Chinese people came on stage holding five-star red flags, indicating that they had turned over and won victory and built a new China under the leadership of the Communist Party; then Soviet friends came on stage, first establishing diplomatic relations with us, and representatives of new democratic countries in Southeast Europe, Korea, and the Mongolian People's Republic, wearing costumes of various ethnic styles, came on stage one by one and established friendly relations with the Chinese nation. All the ethnic groups of China joined hands, circled the field under the five-star red flag, and strode forward towards the road of self-reliance and development.

	Today's collective games and dances took a very unique form. Instead of concentrating the performances in a large venue, the games and songs and dances were spread throughout every corner of the park. Young people and children from major primary and secondary schools were on the hills and by the roadsides, like troops camping, playing various joyful games such as "Catching Traitors," "Passing Gloves," "Stabbing Electricity," and "Bumping Balls." Noon was the time with the most visitors. Old men with crutches, middle-aged couples leading children, workers, students, and soldiers crowded all the roads in the park. Everywhere were red flags, songs, dances, drums, and laughter. The faces of the elderly were revived with the radiance of youth, and the bare branches seemed to reveal some spring flavor. The song and dance team of the New China Women's Vocational School won the most attention from the masses. They played the "The People Say" game, in which one person acted as a people's representative, saying "The people say to work," and the whole circle of people would make movements of hoeing the ground. They also sang and performed new songs such as "Work Song" and "Happy New Year," like a group of happy angels. The audience was reluctant to leave them, and many children couldn't help but join their ranks and dance with them. Bathing in the midday sun, strolling in the ocean of songs and laughter, people enjoyed the great joy of the victorious New Year for the first time. Several children from the Sixth Primary School of the Middle School walked and smiled, quietly listening to their teacher telling them the "Story of the Mulberry Tree and the Tree of Heaven." The happy world is now reappearing before our eyes. Bless the young friends of New China, bless the children of New China!

    万众欢乐度新年
    记中山、北海两公园的联欢大会
    欢乐的锣鼓声、歌声和笑声把冻凝的空气消融为一片春意，笼罩在中山公园里。阳光下，一声炮响，满园子的穿着灰色和绿色制服的革命职员们，红色、蓝色、黑色外衣的学生们和工人们，一个个拿着枯树枝，在小山边，在亭子角，在池边上，翻着石头，扳着树枝，拨着枯草，搜索着“反动派”。蓦地这里一声女孩子的欢呼，那里一阵男孩子的哄笑，躲藏在石缝里树皮下的一个个“反动派”—画着战犯蒋介石等丑像的纸片，毕竟被他们一一搜索到了。发奖台前拥挤着一群群搜索到反动派的“有功者”。
    一阵阵的锣鼓，一阵阵的欢笑，四十几个地方同时在进行集体舞蹈和集体游戏。学生们一面表演一面邀请参观者参加。一些青年店员们已十分自然愉快地和学生一起高唱《团结就是力量》了。
    水榭里，展览着的北京学生运动的照片上，北京学生们是在国民党的特务和警察的监视之下唱着《团结就是力量》来保护自己的。一个十一二岁的孩子看到了昆明“一二·一”惨案中四烈士牺牲的血淋淋的照片时，他恐怖得叫起来。而窗外，正响起了《解放区的天》、《祖国进行曲》，小孩子跑了出去，立即忘记了一切，快活地高声和着唱起来。
    音乐堂在工人和学生表演着歌舞，中山堂里北京的艺人表演着新曲艺，中山堂前的方场上，红绿的彩绸在飞扬，扩音器里播送着“翻身道情”。解放不到一年的工人，歌唱着“把破坏的道路铺起来，把熊熊的锅炉烧起来”，“前方后方加油干，全国的胜利在眼前”，他们十分雄劲和谐地唱着四部合唱，三部重唱和齐唱。被服厂唱着自编的《过新年》，《买公债》；京津铁路局工人演出了自己排演的腰鼓舞，有力的手敲击着小红鼓，就像他们熟练地驾御着他们的机器一样。
    男二中女四中近二百人的大合唱队歌唱着自九一八到解放战争胜利的歌曲。他们唱出了热血沸腾的《义勇军进行曲》，凄凉的《松花江上》，雄壮的《八路军进行曲》，矫健的《我们都是神枪手》，讽嘲的《蒋匪帮呀一团糟》，轻快的《野战军进行曲》，当他们唱到“红旗飘扬”时，蓦地在一排排蓝黑色制服的后面升起了一列红旗，歌声激荡着全场的感情，歌声带领着人们一步步从过去走到现在，当他们唱到毛主席，毛主席的巨像高高升起来时，人们怀着感激和热爱热烈地鼓起掌来。
    北海的冰上运动会是一个精采的盛会，它不再着重往年的“反正八字”、“平均运动”等个人技术，却有了许多集体的新创造，如二人合作的“正退溜”，十人结成一队的“拉龙”竞赛，都是提倡集体合作的。大同中学表演。《扔掉包袱才能进马列主义之门》，华北电业公司表演的《中国人民大团结》、《不怕原子弹》、《识破白皮书》、《粉碎帝国主义》都是政治性很强的新节目。外交部创造的《一面倒》，得到了一致的赞誉，情节是：开场时中国人民手执五星红旗上场，表示在共产党领导之下翻身胜利建设了新中国；接着有苏联友人上场，首先与我建立外交关系，东南欧各新民主国家，朝鲜和外蒙古共和国的代表，身着各色民族形式的服装一一上场，和中华民族建立了友好关系。中国的各个民族都拉起手来，在五星红旗招展下绕场一周，阔步前进，走向自强发展的道路。
    今天的集体游戏和舞蹈，采取了很别致的形式，它不是集中到一个大场子挨次表演，而且把游戏和歌舞，布满了全园的每个角落，各大中小学的青年和儿童们，在山头，在路边，好像军队在露营，“捉汉奸”，“传手套”，“剌电”，“碰球”……，作着各种愉快的游戏。中午时分是游人最多的时刻，拄着拐杖的老翁，领着小孩的中年夫妇，工人，学生，战士，拥塞了园中一切道路，到处是红旗，到处是歌舞、鼓声、笑声，老年人的脸上复活了青春的光彩，枯秃的树枝似乎也透露着一些春意。新中国女子职业学校的歌舞队，赢得的群众最多，他们玩着“人民说”的游戏，中间一人当人民代表，他说“人民说要劳动”，满圈的人就都作锄地的动作，他们还一面唱一面表演《作工谣》，《祝新年快乐》等新歌子，简直是一群幸福的天使。观众们都舍不得离开他们，好些小孩子们都情不自禁地加入他们的行列和他们一块跳舞起来。沐浴着中午的阳光，漫步在歌声和笑语的海洋，人们第一次享受到了胜利的新春的大欢乐。六中附小的几个小朋友，一面走一面微笑，静听着老师给他们讲“桑树和椿树的故事”；幸福的世界，今天重现在眼前，祝福新中国的青年朋友，祝福新中国的儿童们！
