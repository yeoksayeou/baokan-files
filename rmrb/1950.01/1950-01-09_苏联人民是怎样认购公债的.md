How the Soviet People Subscribe to Government Bonds
Jiang Hongju

The Soviet people consider subscribing to national bonds a glorious expression of patriotism. Every time the government announces the regulations for issuing bonds, every worker, engineer, collective farmer, teacher, doctor, scholar, and clerk voluntarily competes to subscribe, and often the subscription figure exceeds the total issuance within one or two days.

For example, after World War II, the Soviet government issued four government bonds to restore and develop the national economy. The first was in 1946, with subscriptions exceeding the original issuance by 1.818 billion rubles; the second was in 1947, exceeding 2.467 billion rubles; the third was issued in 1948, exceeding 2.592 billion rubles; and the fourth was issued on May 3, 1949, stipulating a total issuance of 20 billion, but by the next day, the subscription figure had reached 21.691 billion rubles, and by May 8 it had reached 23.825 billion rubles.

The reason why the subscription figure for the fourth bond exceeded the planned total by such a large amount is that the issuance of this bond received particularly enthusiastic support from the broad masses of the people.

After the government announced the regulations for the issuance of the fourth bond on May 3 last year, a surge of subscriptions immediately arose among the broad masses of the people. Factories, schools, collective farms, mines, and mining fields spontaneously held meetings to subscribe to the bonds. The enthusiastic situation of the Soviet people subscribing to the bonds can be seen from the following statements:

After the "Hammer and Sickle" factory in Moscow announced the issuance of the bonds, a young worker, Ivan Grakhkiangyoloch, squeezed forward from the crowd and said:

　　——Many of our new factories have been built with our savings. Subscribing to government bonds is to build more new large-scale factories, everyone come!

Old technician Klemilov, who had worked diligently in this factory for thirty-seven years and was a Communist Party member personally cultivated by Lenin, also squeezed into the crowd to subscribe to the bonds, saying:

　　——Everything is for the strength of our motherland! Dedicate our love to the Party, to the country, to Stalin! ——

The crowd in the square grew larger and larger, and the hall was also crowded with people, buzzing with noise.

　　——Has the subscription started yet?

　　——It has started.

　　——Please subscribe in order at the table.

The old hydraulic press technician Karlklov had just finished subscribing when a young technician, wearing blue work glasses, ran over and asked him.

　　——Hey! How much did you subscribe?

　　——You should subscribe well too! I have already subscribed, don't fall behind!

Laughter and singing happily spread the numbers of each person's subscription.

　　——I'm still waiting, have you already subscribed?

A blacksmith named Kimonfeyev from the "Kirov" factory in Leningrad said at a meeting:

　　——Do you remember, comrades! During those difficult days when Leningrad was blockaded, our factory was close to the front line and suffered heavy damage from enemy heavy artillery and bombs. We saw it all with our own eyes. And now? New houses have been built, and our workers can work with peace of mind and live happily. We subscribe to government bonds with joy to further help our country build more new factories, schools, and residences, so that we can live a more fulfilling life!

An elderly female worker named Rufovna Silari from the "Stalin Oil Depot" in Baku said at a meeting to subscribe to government bonds:

　　——This is not the first time we have subscribed to government bonds. Every time we subscribe to government bonds, I, along with you, write my name on the subscription certificate with the greatest pride and glory. I deeply understand that subscribing to government bonds is to help our motherland, strengthen its power and wealth, and help it build communism. We, the workers of the Baku oil mines, like all the Soviet people, never spare anything for our motherland, whether it is our labor or our hard-earned savings.

The enthusiasm of Soviet farmers in subscribing to government bonds was not behind that of the workers. A farmer named Daserbajev from a collective farm in Ukraine said at a meeting to subscribe to government bonds: "Our collective farm and I personally have received help from the country. Today, we must be well aware that in order to strengthen the construction of industry and agriculture and to rapidly complete the post-war five-year plan, we are willing to dedicate our labor savings to increase the wealth of the motherland."

A farmer named Simachenko from a collective farm in Kiev Province said: "Today, we Soviet people see the life of our countryside and collective farms. Our land is cultivated with machines, the countryside is electrified, and the collective farms have bumper harvests year after year. Our only task at present is to help our country, that is to say, to help ourselves."

The Soviet intellectuals also, with a high degree of political awareness, and like all working people, wholeheartedly supported the government's issuance of government bonds. Bao Erjin, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and winner of the Stalin Prize, said: "Year after year, the Soviet people have dedicated their hard-earned savings to the socialist motherland. For us Soviet scientific workers, and for all workers in the country, the interests of the motherland are paramount, and the interests of building a communist society are above all else. The issuance of new government bonds enables socialist industry and agriculture to develop more smoothly and achieve the prosperity of Soviet science."

All of this demonstrates the great patriotic spirit of the Soviet people, the unity and consistency of the people's political morality, and the infinite loyalty to the Bolshevik Party and the great leader Stalin.

In principle, Soviet government bonds are fundamentally different from government bonds issued by capitalist countries. Soviet government bonds are productive. Developing the national economy and improving the level of cultural life through the issuance of government bonds serves the interests of the broad masses of the people and the country. Government bonds issued by capitalist countries have no productive significance because the means of production are privately owned. The purpose of issuing government bonds is nothing more than to try to make up for the deficit in the national budget and to open up resources for repaying national debt, so it is not productive. Tax sources are expanded everywhere, and workers are their main tax objects and the heaviest bearers.

Soviet government bonds can be called people's government bonds because the entire people participates in the subscription. In capitalist countries, it is very different. Supporting the country's issuance of government bonds are the wealthy exploiting classes, capitalists, bankers, and brokers and usurers who specialize in making profits from the transfer of government bond tickets. The Soviet people subscribe to government bonds out of their own interests and the interests of their own country, believing that purchasing government bonds is a national obligation. In capitalist countries, it is for the purpose of obtaining profits, trying to prevent the free flow of currency, and obtaining income. In capitalist countries, government bonds are a weapon for exploiting the working class and the peasant class. In essence, they are predatory and against the interests of the people, and the heavy burden of financial resources is transferred to the shoulders of the working people.

In the socialist country of the Soviet Union, the issuance of government bonds is to develop productivity, expand the wealth of the people, and improve the cultural and material living standards of the working people. This is the reason why the Soviet people love their motherland, dedicate a portion of their labor income, and help the Soviet state work hard to build and move towards a communist society. This is the reason why the number of people subscribing to government bonds exceeds the planned total every time the Soviet Union issues government bonds.

    苏联人民是怎样认购公债的
    蒋洪举
    苏联人民认为认购国家公债，是一件光荣的爱国主义的表现。每一次政府发行公债的条例一公布，每一个工人、工程师、集体农民、教师、医生、学者、职员，都自愿地争相认购，往往在一两天内，认购数字就超过发行总额。
    例如在第二次世界大战以后，苏联政府为恢复及发展国民经济，已发行过四次公债，第一次是在一九四六年，认购数字超过原发行总额十八亿一千八百万卢布；第二次是在一九四七年，超过二十四亿六千七百万卢布；一九四八年发行第三次公债，超过二十五亿九千二百万卢布；一九四九年五月三日发行第四次，规定发行总额为二百亿，但到第二天，认购数字已达二百一十六亿九千一百万卢布，到五月八日已达二百三十八亿二千五百万卢布。
    第四次公债认购数字所以超过预定总额如此之巨，是因为这次公债的发行获得广大人民的特别热烈的拥护。
    当政府去年五月三日公布发行第四次公债的条例以后，在广大的人民群众中立即掀起了争购的浪潮。工厂、学校、集体农场、矿山、矿场，都自发地纷纷举行会议，认购公债。苏联人民认购公债的热烈情况，可从以下所引的发言中看出来。
    莫斯科“镰刀与铁锤”厂宣布发行公债后，一个年青的工人伊凡·格拉克基昂洛奇从人堆里挤上前去说：
    ——我们有许多新的工厂，是用我们的积蓄建造起来的。认购公债是为了建立更多的新的大规模的工厂，大家来啊！
    老年技师克列米洛夫，在这个工厂里，辛劳地工作了三十七年，是列宁亲手培植的共产党员，也挤到人丛中认购公债，他说：
    ——一切都是为了我们祖国的强大！把我们的热爱献给党，献给国家，献给斯大林！——
    广场上的人群，越来越多，大厅里也挤满了人，乱哄哄地。
    ——认购开始了没有？
    ——开始了。
    ——在桌子旁边，请按秩序认购。
    老年的延压技工卡而克洛夫刚刚认购完了，一个年青技工，带着蓝色的工作眼镜跑过来问他。
    ——喂！你认购了多少？
    ——你也好好地来认购吧！我已经认购过了，不要落后啊！
    欢笑声，歌唱，愉快地相传着各人认购的数字。
    ——我还在等着呢，你们已经认购了吗？
    列宁格勒“克洛夫”制造厂的一个锻工基蒙费也夫在集会上说：
    ——你们还记得吗？同志们！当列宁格勒被封锁时的那些艰苦的日子，我们的工厂就临近最前线，遭受敌人的重炮和炸弹的重大破坏，这都是我们亲眼看到的。现在呢？新的房屋建造起来了，我们工人能够安心工作和愉快的生活着。我们欢欣鼓舞地来认购公债，就是为了更进一步地帮助我们的国家建设更多的新的工厂、学校、住宅，使我们生活过得更美满！
    巴库“斯大林油库”的一位老年的女工鲁福娜·西拉丽在认购公债的集会上说：
    ——我们不是第一次认购公债了。在每一次认购公债时，我和你们一起，以最大的骄傲和光荣，把我的名字写在认购证上。我深切的了解，认购公债，就是帮助我们的祖国，加强它的力量和财富，帮助它建设共产主义。我们巴库油矿的工人们，和一切苏联人民一样，对于我们的祖国，我们从不吝惜任何东西，无论是自己的劳力，或是自己的辛劳积蓄。
    苏联农民认购公债的热烈，也不落后于工人。乌克兰一个集体农场的农民达色巴也夫，在认购公债的会议上说：“我们的集体农场和我个人，曾经得到了国家的帮助。今天，我们要好好认识，为了加强工业和农业的建设，为了迅速完成战后五年计划，我们愿献出自己的劳动积蓄，增加祖国的财富。”
    基也辅省一个集体农场的农民西马琴科说：“今天，我们苏联人民看到自己农村和集体农场的生活。用机器耕种我们的土地，农村电气化，集体农场又是年年丰收。我们目前的唯一任务，就是去帮助我们的国家，也就是说，帮助我们自己。”
    苏联的知识分子也同样地以高度的政治觉悟，和全部劳动人民一样，全心一意地支持政府发行的公债。苏联科学院副院长、斯大林奖金获得者包尔金说：“一年一年，苏联人民把他们自己的辛劳的积蓄献给了社会主义的祖国。对于我们苏联的科学工作者，和对于国内一切劳动者一样，祖国的利益至上，共产主义社会建设的利益高于一切。新的公债的发行，使社会主义的工业和农业能够更顺利地向前发展，而达到苏联科学的繁荣。”
    这一切正表示出苏联人民伟大的爱国主义的精神，人民政治道德的团结一致，对于布尔什维党和伟大的领袖斯大林的无限忠诚。
    苏联的公债，在原则上，是与资本主义国家所发行的公债根本不同的。苏联的公债是生产性的，以发行公债的方式，发展国民经济和提高文化生活水平，是为广大的人民群众和国家的利益而服务的。资本主义国家所发行的公债，并无任何生产意义，因为生产手段为私人所占有。发行公债的目的，无非是企图弥补国家预算的赤字，为偿付国债开一资源，所以不是生产性的。到处扩大税源，而劳动者就是他们的主要的课征对象，最沉重的担负者。
    苏联的公债可以称为人民的公债，因为参加认购的是全体人民。在资本主义国家，则大不相同。支持国家发行公债的是富有的剥削阶级、资本家、银行家以及那些专靠公债票转来转去而从中渔利的经纪人和高利贷者。苏联人民认购公债，是从自己的利益和自己国家的利益出发，认为购买公债是国民的义务。在资本主义国家，是为了获取利润，竭力阻止自由货币手段，而取得收入。在资本主义国家，公债是剥削工人阶级和农民阶级的一种武器，在本质上是掠夺性的，反对人民利益的，把财政来源的沉重负担，转嫁到劳动人民的肩上去。
    在社会主义的国家苏联，发行公债是为了发展生产力，扩充人民的财富，提高劳动人民的文化和物质生活的水准。这就是苏联人民所以热爱他们的祖国，献出自己的部分劳动所得，帮助苏维埃国家努力建设，向共产主义社会迈进的原因，这就是苏联每次发行公债时人民认购的数字超过预定总额的原因。
