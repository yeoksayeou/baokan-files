Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th—The second session of the 81st United States Congress, controlled by the Democratic and Republican parties, convened on the 3rd. US President Truman attended a joint session of Congress on the 4th and delivered his annual "State of the Union Address." This address shows that US imperialism will continue its aggressive policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, and expanding outwards. In terms of foreign policy, Truman requested that Congress: 1. Continue to support the Marshall Plan in order to further aggression against Western European countries; 2. Implement the so-called "collective defense" plan established by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, so as to place the military control of the contracting countries in the hands of US imperialism and turn the people of the contracting countries into cannon fodder for US imperialism to launch new wars. 3. Implement the "Point Four Program" (i.e., the so-called technical assistance to "backward areas" plan) that he put forward in his inaugural address on January 20th of last year, so as to more deeply invade and enslave the colonies and affiliated countries of Britain, the Netherlands, France, and Belgium. 4. Invest heavily in foreign countries in order to find outlets for the ever-increasing surplus capital of American capitalists. 5. Approve the regulations of the International Trade Organization to eliminate world trade barriers and facilitate the dumping of surplus American goods, thereby exporting the crisis.

In order to continue expanding armaments and preparing for war, Truman also requested that Congress extend the peacetime conscription power (according to which this power will expire on June 24), so as to recruit young people aged 18 to 25 to serve as tools for American reactionaries to carry out new aggression abroad.

In order to deceive the people, Truman once again hypocritically asked Congress to abolish the Taft-Hartley Act, and requested to pass the Civil Rights Act, expand the Social Security Act, the National Health Act, and pass Secretary of Agriculture Brannan's agricultural plan, etc.

    杜鲁门提“国情咨文”
    显示美帝继续扩军备战
    【新华社北京七日电】民主党与共和党所控制的美国第八十一届国会第二期会议，已于三日开会。美总统杜鲁门于四日出席国会联席会议，提出其一年一度的“国情咨文”。这一咨文显示美帝国主义将继续进行其扩军备战及向外扩张的侵略政策。杜鲁门要求国会在对外政策方面：一、继续支持马歇尔计划，以便向西欧各国作进一步的侵略；二、执行北大西洋联盟订立的所谓“共同防卫”计划，俾将各缔约国的军事控制在美国帝国主义手中，并把各缔约国人民变为美帝国主义发动新战争时的炮灰。三、执行他在去年一月二十日就职演说中所提出的“第四点计划”（即所谓技术援助“落后地区”计划），借可更深入地侵入及奴役英、荷、法、比各殖民国家的殖民地及附属国。四、大量投资外国，以便为美国资本家日益增多的剩余资本谋得出路。五、批准国际贸易组织法规，以消除世界的商业壁垒，便利美国剩余商品的倾销。从而输出危机。
    杜鲁门为了继续扩军备战，他还要求国会延长和平时期的征兵权力（按此项权力将于六月二十四日满期），以征募十八岁至二十五岁的青年，充当美国反动派向外进行新侵略的工具。
    为了欺骗人民，杜鲁门又一次虚伪地要求国会废除塔夫脱——哈特莱法，并要求通过民权法案、扩大社会保险法案、国民保健法案以及通过农业部长布伦南的农业计划等。
