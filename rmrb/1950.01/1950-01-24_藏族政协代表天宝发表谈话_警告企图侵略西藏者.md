Tibetan People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) representative Sangji Yuexi (Tian Bao) recently spoke to reporters regarding the Lhasa authorities in Tibet sending a so-called "goodwill mission" to the United States, Britain, India, Nepal, and Beijing to declare its "independence." He first stated: Tibet is Chinese territory, just as Xinjiang and Qinghai are Chinese territories; the Tibetan people and other ethnic groups jointly formed our People's Republic of China, which is common knowledge known to all. The only difference between Tibet and Xinjiang and Qinghai is that Tibet is currently suffering from imperialist conspiracies and aggression, and the Tibetan authorities are betraying the interests of the Tibetan people and doing things that violate the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He then said: Since Tibet is a part of the People's Republic of China, our Central People's Government and all ethnic groups in the country will naturally help the Tibetan people get rid of their shackles. This is the duty of the Central People's Government. If the United Press report that the Tibetan authorities are sending a "goodwill mission" to countries such as the United States, Britain, and India to declare its "independence" is true, it shows that Tibetan reactionaries are colluding with imperialists, attempting to sell out Tibet to imperialists at a time when the national liberation cause is about to be completed. Therefore, this matter deserves close attention and vigilance from the people of the whole country. Sangji Yuexi, in his capacity as a Tibetan representative to the CPPCC, firmly supports the statement of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government. He warned those conspirators who attempt to invade Tibet: Any reactionary who attempts to separate Tibet from the motherland will be opposed by the people of Tibet and the whole country, and their conspiracies will be completely defeated.

    藏族政协代表天宝发表谈话
    警告企图侵略西藏者
    西藏是中华人民共和国的一部分，任何反动派阴谋侵略与出卖西藏，都将遭到西藏及全国人民的反对而彻底失败。
    【新华社重庆二十三日电】藏族人民政协代表桑吉悦希（天宝）顷对西藏拉萨当局将派出所谓“亲善使团”分赴美、英、印度、尼泊尔和北京等地表明其“独立”一事向记者发表谈话。他首先说：西藏是中国的领土，正如新疆、青海是中国的领土一样；藏族和其他各民族共同组织了我们的中华人民共和国，这是一切人们都知道的普通常识。但唯一和新疆、青海不同的地方，就是西藏现在还受着帝国主义的阴谋侵略，西藏当局正出卖藏族人民的利益，做着违反人民政协共同纲领的事情。接着他说：西藏既然是中华人民共和国的一部分，我中央人民政府和国内各民族自然要帮助西藏人民摆脱枷锁。这是中央人民政府本分内的事情。合众社所传西藏当局派什么“亲善使团”到美、英、印度等国去表明其“独立”，这个消息如果属实，就表明西藏反动分子勾结帝国主义，企图在全国解放事业将竟全功之时，把西藏出卖给帝国主义。因此，这一事情值得全国人民密切的注意和警惕。桑吉悦希以人民政协藏族代表的资格坚决拥护中央人民政府外交部发言人的谈话。他向企图侵略西藏的同谋者提出警告说：任何反动派企图使西藏脱离祖国，都将遭受西藏及全国人民的反对，他们的阴谋都要彻底失败。
