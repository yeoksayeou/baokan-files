    New Year's Eve Summary
    Wu Jingchao, Professor at Tsinghua University
    Lenin said in his article "The Lessons of the Revolution": "During revolutionary times, millions and tens of millions of people learn more in a week than they do in a year of ordinary, muddled life." Many Chinese people experienced the truth of this statement in 1949.
    Indeed, in 1949, during this great revolutionary period, we learned many things that we could not have learned before.
    I came to understand the Communist Party. This was the result of studying Marxist-Leninist literature, reading Chairman Mao's and Vice-Chairman Liu's essays and reports, from a year of practical experience, and from conversations with Communist friends. In the past, I not only did not know the truth about the Communist Party, but also received distorted interpretations from British and American publications and from reactionary propaganda. Because I did not understand the Communist Party, and at the same time I loathed the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, I sometimes felt lost in politics, and sometimes fell into the trap of reformism, not knowing that the result of reformism would consolidate reactionary rule. This year's new understanding of the Communist Party has enabled me to abandon many past erroneous ideas, and filled me with hope and confidence for the future of China. This is the greatest gain in terms of reason and emotion.
    Secondly, I came to understand the essence of the state. In my student days, the teacher who taught the history of social thought also asked us to read the Communist Manifesto and State and Revolution outside of class. Perhaps in a capitalist social environment, it is not easy to understand such works, so these two books did not leave a deep impression on my mind. This year, during the siege of Beijing, I reread State and Revolution, and only then did I begin to understand the meaning of this book, and only then did I begin to love this book. I must admit that this book has been the most powerful in transforming my thinking. From this book, I understood what class is, what the state is, and learned to classify the countries of the world from a new perspective. From this, I recognized the fundamental differences between the Soviet Union and the United States, and thus corrected my past erroneous views of these two countries. From understanding the state to understanding internationalism is a relatively easy process, but internationalism is also something new I learned this year.
    Thirdly, I also began to understand dialectics. In the past, we who studied sociology also emphasized strict scientific methods, investigation and statistics, and looking at problems comprehensively. But the scientific methods we learned lacked a very important element, that is, looking at problems from the perspective of development, from the perspective of contradictory struggle, and from the perspective of emerging classes. Because we lacked this important factor, our past research easily fell into the bad habit of using discussion to replace action and using empty talk to replace work, as Lenin said. We wrote many articles, but we did not fully consider for whom these articles were written, to whom they were addressed, whom they supported, and whom they opposed. It seemed that after the articles were written and printed, our responsibility was over. Therefore, most of these articles became empty talk and did not have any effect on social development. I hope that this problem can be overcome with dialectics in the future.
    These are a few points I have learned this year. There are many other things I have not learned. I hope that diligent work next year will bring more gains. At the same time, I hope that people like me who have been trained in the old education will enthusiastically welcome the high tide of learning next year, receive the baptism of Marxism-Leninism, and retrain ourselves as loyal servants of the New Democratic era, so as to serve the people wholeheartedly in the upcoming economic construction and cultural construction.

    除夕总结
    清华教授  吴景超
    列宁在《革命的教训》一文中说过：在革命时期中，几百万，几千万人在每星期中所学得的东西，要比平常梦昧生活的一年还多些。这句话的真理，许多中国人在一九四九年都会体验到的。
    的确，我们在一九四九年，在这个大革命的时期中，学到了许多东西，是以前无法学到的。
    我认识了共产党。这是从学习马列主义的文献，从阅读毛主席及刘副主席的论文及报告，从一年来的实际经验，从与共产党的朋友交谈中得到的结果。以往不但不知道共产党的真相，而且从英美的刊物中，从反动派的宣传中，得到歪曲的解释。因为对于共产党不了解，同时对于国民党的反动统治厌恶，所以过去对于政治，有时感到彷徨，有时落入改良主义的陷阱，不知道改良主义的结果，会巩固反动统治的。今年对于共产党的新认识，使我扬弃了过去许多错误的观念，使我对于中国的前途，充满了希望与信心，这是理智上与感情上最大的收获。
    其次，我认识了国家的本质。在我当学生的时代，教社会思想史的先生，也曾要我们于课外读共产党宣言及国家与革命。也许在资本主义的社会环境中，对于这种著作的了解是不容易的，所以这两本书没有在我的脑海中留下深刻的印象。今年在北京围城时期，重读国家与革命，才开始了解这本书的意义，才开始热爱这一本书。对于改造我的思想最有力量的，我得承认是这一本书了。从这一本书，我明白什么是阶级，什么是国家，并且学会了以新的观点，来把世界上的国家分类。我由此而认识苏联与美国在基本上不同之点，因而改正了我过去对于这两个国家的错误的看法。由认识国家到认识国际主义，是一个比较容易的过程，但是国际主义，对于我，也是今年新学到的东西。
    再其次，我也开始认识辩证法。我们学社会学的人，过去也曾讲求严格的科学方法，讲求调查统计，讲求全面的看问题。但是我们所学到的科学方法中，还缺少了一点很重要的因素，那就是从发展的观点，从矛盾斗争的观点，从新兴阶级的观点来看问题。因为缺少了这一个重要因素，所以我们过去的研究，便容易陷于列宁所说的爱用讨论来代替作事，用空话来代替工作的恶习。我们写了许多文章，但是这些文章，到底是为谁写的、给谁看的、拥护谁的、反对谁的，自己都没有充分考虑，好像文章写出印出之后，自己的责任便算完了。因此，这些文章大部分都变成空谈，对于社会的发展，丝毫也不发生作用。这种毛病，希望以后可以用辩证法来克服他。
    这是今年所学到的几点，此外没有学到的还很多。希望来年勤恳的工作，可以有更多的收获。同时我更希望像我这种从旧式教育中训练出来的人，都踊跃的迎接来年学习的高潮，获得马列主义的洗礼，把自己重新训练为一个新民主主义时代的忠诚服务者，以便在即将来到的经济建设及文化建设中，全心全意的为人民服务。
