[This newspaper's Shandong News] The Binbei Prefectural Committee of the CCP Jiaodong District convened a meeting of county propaganda chiefs from December 16th to 23rd of last year to review the current state of study among county and district cadres. The meeting pointed out that while everyone has an urgent desire to study, the contradiction between work and study, and the idea of prioritizing work over study, still seriously exist. Certain Party committees do not yet have a sufficient understanding that leading study is an important part of all leadership work. The meeting believed that strengthening the study of county and district cadres should start with the following three basic links:

(1) Conduct in-depth education to clear cadres' thinking about studying. First, county and district committees should attach great importance to leading study. Second, leaders should conduct education based on the different ideological conditions of cadres. For example, most leading cadres emphasize "being too busy with work to find time to study." Leaders should address their thinking from the aspects of squeezing time when there is none, asking when they don’t understand, and delving into things when they don’t know how, as well as scientifically managing time. Some older comrades have a negative attitude towards studying. In addition to clearing their thinking from the perspective of building a bright future for the new China, leaders can also give them a small calculation, such as learning three characters in three days, which means learning 120 characters in a year, to enhance their confidence in learning. Some old comrades of worker-peasant origin who have a long work history believe that "whether studying or not, it’s still work," or that "it’s the intellectuals who make mistakes, we are workers and peasants and haven’t made any mistakes yet." For this kind of blind tendency to underestimate study, repeated education should be conducted to make them realize that "without study, you cannot work." At the same time, leaders should also solve the difficulties cadres have in studying, such as studying and solving how cadres can stick to their study plans in a decentralized and mobile environment. Finally, leaders should use actual and vivid facts to educate cadres, making them recognize the importance of study. For example, when the Gaomi County Committee deployed the autumn grain collection work, the cadres of the Zhongling District were unable to study the various methods proposed by the county committee well after returning to the district because they could only listen and not record, which meant that the autumn grain collection work in the district was not well implemented and the work suffered great losses. Leaders should seize these examples to educate cadres.

		Party Committees at All Levels Overcome Bureaucracy and Improve the Consciousness of Leading Study

(2) Party committees at all levels should improve their consciousness of leading study and overcome the tendency to be busy and chaotic with routine matters. County committees should first truly recognize the importance of leading study ideologically. The meeting decided that each county should seriously review past leadership of study, formulate a county committee study plan, and propose opinions on strengthening leadership of study in the future. Second, a member of the county committee should be assigned to be the director of the study committee, and a study group should be formed with the county committee as the core to play a leading, promoting, and demonstrative role. Third, the liberalistic attitude and undisciplined phenomenon of the propaganda departments of the Party committees towards leading study should be overcome. If cadre study is not done well, the propaganda department should first examine its own work, correct the phenomenon of only completing the central work and neglecting the business of the propaganda work department. Cadres of propaganda work should become models of learning for all cadres.

(3) Establish necessary systems. Adhere to the daily two-hour study system. Meetings at the prefectural and county levels shall not take up the two hours of study time. Establish a regular, level-by-level examination system. Members of the county committee, party group secretaries, and ministers shall be tested by the prefectural committee. The tests shall be conducted monthly from January 1950, and the scores and attendance shall be recorded. A system of giving lectures should be established for study of district cadres, and a study day should be strictly implemented every five or seven days. From January onwards, each cadre shall make a study plan, and the county and district committees shall promptly check the study of the cadres. Institutions and schools above the county level shall begin to be established immediately.

    滨北召开各县宣传部长会议
    研讨县区干部学习
    确定三项办法，解决工作学习矛盾，并克服轻视学习现象。
    【本报山东讯】中共胶东区滨北地委于去年十二月十六至二十三日召开的各县宣传部长会议，检查了当前的县区干部学习。指出大家都有学习的迫切要求，但工作与学习矛盾、重工作轻学习的思想仍严重存在，某些党委对领导学习是全部领导工作中的重要一环，还没有足够的认识。会议认为加强县区干部学习应从以下三个基本环节着手：
    （一）深入教育，打通干部学习思想。首先县、区委应十分重视领导学习。其次领导上应根据干部不同的思想情况进行教育。如一般领导干部多强调“工作忙没时间学习”，领导上应从没时间“要挤”，不懂“要问”，不会“要钻”，与科学的支配时间方面去打通他们的思想。有些年龄大的同志，对学习持消极态度，领导上除从建设新中国的光明前途方面打通他们的思想外，还可同他们算一算小账，如三天识一个字，一年能识一百二十个字，增强他们对学习的信心。工作历史较久的工农出身的老同志，有的认为“学习也工作，不学习也工作”，或认为“犯错误的是那些知识分子，咱是工农可还没犯错误”。对于这种盲目的轻视学习的倾向，要进行反复教育，使之认识“不学习就不会工作”。同时领导上还要解决干部学习困难。如研究解决干部在分散流动的环境下，如何坚持学习计划的问题。最后，领导上应用实际的生动事实教育干部，使之认识学习的重要。如高密县委布置秋征工作时，中岭区干部因只能听不能记录，回区后无法很好研究县委所提出的各种办法，因之该区秋征工作即未很好贯彻，使工作受到很大损失。领导上便应抓紧这些事例来教育干部。
            各级党委克服事务主义  提高领导学习的自觉性
    （二）各级党委要提高领导学习的自觉性，克服事务忙乱的作风。县委首先在思想上真正认识领导学习的重要。会议确定各县应认真检讨过去学习领导，订出县委学习计划及提出今后加强领导学习的意见。其次，县委分工任学委会主任，并以县委为核心编成学习小组，起领导推动示范作用。再次，克服党委宣传部门对领导学习的自由主义态度及无纪律现象。干部学习做不好，宣传部首应检查自己的工作，纠正只完成中心工作而忽视宣传工作部门的业务的现象，宣传工作干部应成为一切干部的学习模范。
    （三）建立必要的制度。坚持每日两小时的学习制度，地、县两级开会也不得占用两小时的学习时间。建立定期的逐级的考试制度，县委委员、党组书记、部长均由地委出题测验，自一九五○年一月份起每月测验一次，评定分数记分考勤。区干部学习建立上大课制，严格执行五天或七天一次学习日。自一月份起，每个干部订出学习计划，县、区党委应及时检查干部的学习。县以上的机关学校立即开始建立。
