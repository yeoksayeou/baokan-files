Editor's Note: We believe Comrade Yang Xin's opinion is good. Such phenomena of non-compliance with policies and irresponsibility in propaganda should be overcome. We hope that the organizations in Shijiazhuang responsible for propaganda work and the authors of these poems and paintings will make public self-criticisms of the above criticisms.

During the propaganda for 1950—the first new year of the people's victory—many street poems and paintings appeared in Shijiazhuang. These phenomena are good, and indeed, many excellent works have been discovered. However, there are also some inappropriate aspects that deserve our study and attention.

For example, in street poetry, some people wrote: "The whole country is liberated, only Tibet and Taiwan remain; these places don't need to be fought for, they will automatically come to us." This statement either leads people to "sit and wait for victory" or makes people view the war as "easy." When we propagate to the masses, we must be realistic. The enemy is bound to die, and we are bound to win, which should be affirmed; but the enemy will never die on their own, and our victory must be won through arduous struggle. Therefore, the purpose of our propaganda should be to encourage the masses to make another effort under the victorious situation and carry the revolution through to the end!

Some also wrote: "Intensify production to support the front, produce more grain and hand over public grain; public grain must also be calculated in cotton, not rice or wheat." It is good that we are widely publicizing the benefits of growing cotton among the masses, combining agricultural production with industrial needs; but comrades, please think, what kind of propaganda to the masses is this? "Produce more grain and hand over public grain," those who are unaware of the truth may misunderstand, thinking that they will have to hand over more public grain if they produce more grain anyway. And then they see, even worse! Handing over rice or wheat is not acceptable, only cotton, what kind of effect will this cause? Such street poems not only completely contradict the Party's policies and government decrees but also cannot effectively mobilize the masses for production; on the contrary, they only confuse public opinion and unnecessarily increase the worries of the masses.

In publicizing the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, some even wrote: "The great power is called the Soviet Union, uniquely dominating Europe and Asia." The use of "uniquely dominating" here is a gross misrepresentation of the peaceful foreign policy of the great socialist Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is a strong fortress of world peace and democratic forces against imperialism, not "dominating," which is well known, and I don't need to say more. However, such writing not only cannot make the masses better understand the Soviet Union and further enhance the friendship of Sino-Soviet cooperation; on the contrary, it will also cause the people to misunderstand the Soviet Union.

Similarly, in street paintings, we feel that some are also worth discussing.

I have seen a painting titled "Great Victory at the Front, Great Harvest at the Rear," this painting depicts a young woman holding a bundle of wheat, with a soldier standing alone in a corner behind her, expressing no meaning. Where is the "Great Victory at the Front"? No spoils of victory are seen at all.

Another example is a picture titled "Hurricane of Peace," which depicts two steamships (one flying the star-spangled banner of the American steamship, and one flying the Kuomintang flag of the Jiang bandits steamship), sailing in the sea, encountering hurricanes and reefs, about to capsize and sink. What is this hurricane? According to the author, it is "the power of peace"; what is this reef? According to the author, it is "the power of peace." This is also inappropriate. Because reefs symbolize reactionary, backward, and dark forces, just as the sun represents light and white jade represents purity, these should not be confused. Symbolic things are often not entirely accurate, but they have their own certain laws and class nature. The Jiang-American bandits have become ships sailing in the sea, and the peace and democratic forces of the world's people have become counter-currents, storms, and harmful reefs, which is completely contrary to the original intention of the propaganda!

Street poems and paintings are artistic works that publicly propagate to the masses, correctly explain policies, and promote policies.

We are responsible to the Party and the people, and we must never be careless or ambiguous. We must strive to pay attention to mastering political principles and improve the ideological and artistic qualities of our works.

    街头诗、画的思想性
    杨新
    编者按  我们认为杨新同志这意见是好的。这种在宣传上不合政策和不负责任的现象应当加以克服，我们希望石家庄负责宣传工作的机关和这些诗画的作者对以上的批评作公开的检讨。
    一九五○年——人民胜利的第一个新年的宣传中，在石家庄出现了很多的街头诗、画，这些现象是好的，而且也确实发现了不少优秀的作品。但是，这中间也存有不够恰当的地方，值得我们研究和注意的。
    如在街头诗中，就有人这样写：“全国各地都解放，仅剩西藏和台湾；这些地方不用打，它会自动来找咱。”这种说法不是引人“坐待胜利”，便是引人把战争看得“轻而易举”。我们宣传群众，一定要实事求是。敌人必然死亡，我们一定胜利，这是应肯定的；但是敌人绝不会自行死去，我们的胜利也一定要在艰苦的斗争中才能赢得。所以，我们宣传的目的就应是在胜利的形势下，鼓舞群众再努一把力，把革命进行到底！
    有的还这样写：“加紧生产支前线，多打粮食缴公粮；公粮也要棉花算，缴米缴麦都不沾。”我们在群众中广泛宣传种棉的好处，使农业生产与工业需要相结合，这是好的；但同志们，请想想，以上这算什么宣传群众呢？“多打粮食交公粮”，不明真象的群众一看，会发生误解的，反正是多打粮食就要多交公粮了。再一看，更糟！交公粮米麦都不行，非棉花不沾，这会引起怎样的效果？像这样的街头诗，不仅与党的政策和政府的法令完全相抵触，不仅不能很好地发动群众生产；相反，只有淆乱社会听闻，凭空使群众增加一些多余的耽心。
    在宣传中苏友好关系时，有的竟这样写：“泱泱大国苏联称，位居欧亚独称雄。”这里所用的“独称雄”就对伟大的社会主义苏维埃联邦共和国的和平外交政策是极大的曲解，苏联是世界和平与民主力量反帝国主义的坚强堡垒，并不是“称雄”，这是人所共知的，用不着我多说，不过像这样的写法，不但不能使群众更加了解苏联，更进一步增强中苏合作的友谊；相反，还会引起人民对苏联的误解的。
    同样，在街头画中，我们觉得其中有些也是值得提出来探讨的。
    我看过一幅标题为“前方大胜利，后方大丰年，”这幅图画画的是一个大姑娘，抱着一捆麦子，背后画一战士孤零零的站在一角，表现不出什么意义来。“前方大胜利”在那里呢？没有看见一点胜利品。
    再如一幅标题为《和平飓风》的图画中，那里画的是两只汽船（一只是挂着星条旗的美国汽船，一只是挂着国民党旗子的蒋匪汽船），船行在大海里，遇到了飓风和暗礁快颠覆沉没的样子。这飓风是什么呢？按作者注明则是“和平力量”；这暗礁是什么呢？按作者注明则是“和平力量”。这也是不妥切的。因为暗礁是象征反动、倒退、黑暗势力的，这正如太阳代表着光明、白玉代表着纯洁一样，这是不应当混淆的。象征的东西往往不够十分确切，但又是有它一定的规律性和阶级性的。蒋美匪帮成了在大海中航行的船只，我们世界人民的和平、民主的力量成了逆流，成了风暴，成了害人的礁石，这岂不与宣传的本意完全相反！
    街头诗、画，是向群众作公开宣传，正确的解释政策、宣传政策的艺术作品。
    我们为党为人民负责，就绝对不能有所马虎含混。我们一定要努力注意掌握政治原则性，提高作品的思想性和艺术性才好。
