    2. If a portion of the deposit is withdrawn to purchase public bonds, the remaining units must be renewed for another term, calculated from the date of withdrawal.
    3. The withdrawn deposit must be used in full to purchase public bonds at the deposit location and may not be used for any other purpose for any reason. Any remaining fractions less than one fen of a public bond will be refunded in cash.
