Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 24th (TASS): Pravda recently published an editorial discussing the tasks of Soviet trade unions in the upcoming election, stating: "Preparations for the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union are developing on an ever-increasing scale in our cities and villages. The election campaign is bringing new impetus to the political and labor enthusiasm of the working people."

Soviet trade unions have a responsibility to play a significant role in the preparations for the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Soviet trade unions have more than 28 million workers and staff members, and under the leadership of the Party, they are leading millions of working people to actively participate in communist construction. More than ninety percent of industrial personnel are participating in the socialist competition to complete the post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule. During the election preparations, the competition is developing with new strength. The responsibility of the trade unions is to further develop the competition, better utilize internal resources and working capital of the industry, improve product quality and reduce costs. The editorial also discussed the task of trade unions in organizing large-scale political propaganda for the election among the people.

    工会应积极发展竞赛迎接最高苏维埃选举
    【新华社北京二十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：真理报顷发表社论，讨论苏联工会在即将到来的选举中的任务称：选举苏联最高苏维埃的准备工作，正在我国的城镇和乡村中，以越来越大的规模发展着。选举运动给劳动人民的政治与劳动积极性，带来新的动力。
    苏联工会有责任在选举苏联最高苏维埃的准备工作中起重大作用。苏联工会拥有二千八百万以上的工人和职员，并且在党的领导下，带动数以百万计的劳动人民积极参加共产主义建设。工业人员有百分之九十以上，参加了为提早完成战后五年计划的社会主义竞赛。在准备选举期间，竞赛正以新的力量发展着。工会的责任就是要进一步发展竞赛，更好地利用工业的内部资源和流动资金，改善产品质量和减低成本。社论并论及工会在人民中组织选举的大规模政治宣传的任务。
