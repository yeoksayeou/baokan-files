Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 22nd: The Northwest Military and Political Committee held its first meeting on the second day (the 20th). Chairman Peng Dehuai, Committee Member Jia Tuofu, and Vice-Chairman Xi Zhongxun each delivered reports on the future work of the Northwest region, a preliminary budget report on financial revenue and expenditure for 1950, and a report on consultations regarding the organizational structure and personnel allocation of the various committees, departments, bureaus, and offices of the Military and Political Committee.

In his report, Chairman Peng pointed out that thanks to the correct leadership of the great Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise people's leader Chairman Mao Zedong, and the long-term arduous struggle of the people of the Northwest and the people of the whole country, the five provinces of the Northwest have now gloriously achieved complete liberation. The general task for future work is to carry out democratic reforms, develop production, improve culture, and strive to build a new Northwest. Based on this general task, the main tasks at present are: (1) Mobilize all the forces of the people of the Northwest to thoroughly eliminate bandits, eradicate special agents, stabilize social order, practice thrift, overcome difficulties, and restore and develop production. (2) Organize the production of the Northwest People's Liberation Army. In accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on the army participating in production and construction, in addition to carrying out winter training, eliminating remaining bandits, and doing local work, and under the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, vigorously participate in production and construction to overcome the financial and economic difficulties after the war. (3) On the basis of strictly abiding by government policies and decrees, mobilize and enhance the enthusiasm and awareness of the broad masses of peasants, and carry out rural land reform work in an orderly and step-by-step manner, differentiating by region, ethnicity, and other specific conditions and characteristics, and scheduling appropriately. (4) In accordance with the current specific conditions in the Northwest region, focus on developing agriculture and animal husbandry as the center of economic construction, while also focusing on developing industry and transportation. It is necessary to advocate labor to achieve prosperity, carry out a comprehensive large-scale production movement, and strengthen planning and organization in production. In 1950, in terms of agriculture, we must complete the task assigned to the Northwest by the Central People's Government of increasing coarse grain production by 330 million catties and increasing ginned cotton production by 120,000 dan. In terms of industry, the main focus is on expanding the production of the Yumen Oil Mine and restoring the production of the Wusu Oil Factory, and striving to develop the Xiangtang Oil Mine. In terms of transportation, the main task is to repair the Tianbao section of the railway and strive to establish the Tianshui-Lanzhou section of the railway. (5) On the existing basis, carry out the rectification and reform of school education, and partially expand and develop it in areas where conditions permit. In cultural construction, special attention should be paid to the education of workers and ethnic minorities, and the promotion of medical and health publicity work. In governments and the People's Liberation Army at all levels, a cultural and theoretical study movement should also be universally launched. (6) In 1950, in accordance with the "Organizational Regulations for People's Representative Conferences of All Circles" promulgated by the Central People's Government, people's representative conferences of all circles in provinces, cities, and counties must be successfully convened to better unite all democratic classes, democratic parties, and ethnic groups. (7) In areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, ethnic regional autonomy shall be implemented. In people's representative conferences and organs of political power at the provincial, city, and county levels in areas where various ethnic groups live together, each ethnic group shall occupy a considerable number of representatives. All ethnic groups should advance together in accordance with the policy of equality and unity stipulated in the Common Program, and resolutely oppose Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism.

In his report on finance, Committee Member Jia Tuofu listed the specific figures for income and expenditure in the Northwest region in 1950, explained the current financial difficulties in the Northwest region, and proposed that all the people of the Northwest must establish a strong will in their thinking to vigorously promote production, practice economy, and overcome financial difficulties. They must use their greatest efforts to restore and develop production and ensure the completion of grain procurement and tax revenue tasks. Industrialists, businessmen, well-to-do households, and retired wealthy civil and military officials should display a new spirit of patriotism and ensure the completion of the task of promoting public bonds. All People's Liberation Army soldiers and government workers should resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions, actively participate in production and construction, maintain the glorious tradition of hard struggle, and practice economy. Every financial and economic worker must learn to be meticulous in calculations, improve their work, and be able to do effective things with a small amount of money; all expenditures should be distinguished by importance and urgency, opposing the undertaking of everything at once; a strict budget and final accounts system must be established, and the phenomenon of non-compliance with the financial system, the phenomenon of not cherishing national wealth, and all phenomena of corruption and waste must be combated.

Vice-Chairman Xi Zhongxun, based on the "Organizational Regulations for the People's Government Committee of the Greater Administrative Area" passed by the 11th Political Affairs Conference of the Government Council on December 16, 1949, and the preliminary consultations with the committee members representing all parties before the meeting, put forward a list of the organizational structure and personnel allocation of the Northwest Military and Political Committee. Vice-Chairman Xi Zhongxun emphasized that this list was proposed based on the needs of the work, taking into account the situation of various regions, ethnic groups, democratic classes, and democratic parties, and requested all committee members to carefully consider and discuss it.

Then, Committee Member Zhang Jiafu put forward a temporary motion that the meeting send a telegram to thank the great friendly country of the Soviet Union for its just action in demanding the expulsion and removal of the remnant group of the Kuomintang bandit gang from the United Nations, supporting the Central People's Government's appointment of Zhang Wentian as the chief representative to the United Nations, and requesting the United Nations and the Security Council to quickly accept this just note. This temporary motion was unanimously approved by all the committee members.

Before the end of the meeting, representatives from 42 units, including the Dahua Textile Factory, Northwest University, and other large, medium, and small schools, came to present flags, flowers, and congratulatory messages to the Military and Political Committee.
