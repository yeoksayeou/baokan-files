    Jiawang Coal Mine Exceeds Pre-Liberation Production Levels
    Last Year's Coal Output Reached Over 800,000 Tons
    The Main Experiences in Achieving This Success: Resolutely Relying on the Working Class and Actively Improving Underground Safety Equipment
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Through the efforts of all employees last year, the Jiawang Coal Mine in Xuzhou not only restored and expanded the mine's equipment, but also completed the task of mining 814,919 tons of coal. This exceeds the total pre-liberation 1948 output (571,574 tons) by more than 44%; the average coal mining efficiency exceeded pre-liberation levels by 15%, with some exceeding it by a factor of two. Most of the coal produced has already been sold, supplying fuel to the Longhai and Jinpu Railway Bureaus, and the Nanjing, Shanghai, western Longhai line, and Xuzhou areas.
    The main reasons for the mine's great achievements in the first year after liberation are: First, the workers' consciousness has been greatly raised through education in worker training classes and spare-time schools, as well as the communication and study of the Labor University's resolutions. They have established a new labor attitude and brought their enthusiasm for production into full play. Most of the mine's employees have joined the trade union, and some have joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. With the active leadership and promotion of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, the mine's production efficiency has been greatly improved. For example, the Eighth Labor Cooperation Team increased its coal mining efficiency from 0.52 tons to 0.82 tons during the production increase surge in October last year. The first, second, and third groups of the First Labor Cooperation Team of Hanqiao originally had a planned output of 0.8 tons, but they often completed more than one ton, setting a new record for the entire mine. Of course, this achievement is inseparable from the mine's abolition of the illegal exploitation of coal workers by foremen and the implementation of a wage policy of "more pay for more work." In the mining process, all the workers in the Mechanical and Electrical Department configured, cast, and repaired 499 coal cars, electric pumps, and materials within a year to ensure the needs of mine equipment. They cast and manufactured 28,124 picks, spikes, and screws. They also added seven electrical equipment installations in the Hanqiao and Xiaqiao mines. Second, the mine's leadership gradually and clearly grasped and implemented the policy of relying on the working class to restore and develop production. At the beginning of the takeover, due to a lack of clear thinking about relying on the working class in uniting old personnel and handling workers' wages, and a lack of experience, there was a serious bureaucratic work style and mistakes were made. Later, with the continuous help of the higher-level leading organs, and through continuous criticism and self-criticism among the mine's cadres, the correct policy of relying on the working class to restore and develop production was gradually clarified, and the leadership style underwent a significant change in the second half of last year. In July, a mine-wide worker representative conference was convened, and a coal mine management committee was established, absorbing employees to participate in leadership and beginning to implement democratic management, which further enhanced worker enthusiasm. Third, a large amount of funds and manpower were allocated to expand construction and improve underground safety equipment, ensuring the completion of production tasks. According to incomplete statistics: a total of 49 projects above and below ground in the Xiaqiao and Hanqiao mines were carried out throughout the year, including transportation tunnels, ventilation tunnels, waterproofing, drainage, coal lifting, and employee dormitories and warehouses. A total of more than 200,000 workdays of labor were used.
    However, there are still many areas that need improvement in the mine's leadership, such as the management committee not playing a significant enough role, insufficient attention to safety issues, and accidents continuing to occur; the leadership holds too many meetings but solves too few problems, etc. The mine is currently conducting a mine-wide appraisal of merit, appraising production heroes from various departments, giving rewards, and combining this with a summary of the year's production work.

### 贾汪煤矿超过解放前生产量  去年产煤八十余万吨  获得这种成绩的主要经验是：坚决依靠工人阶级，积极改善井下安全设备

    贾汪煤矿超过解放前生产量
    去年产煤八十余万吨
    获得这种成绩的主要经验是：坚决依靠工人阶级，积极改善井下安全设备
    【本报讯】徐州贾汪煤矿，经全体职工去年一年的努力，不仅恢复扩大了该矿的设备，而且完成采煤八一四九一九吨的任务。超过解放前一九四八年总产量（五七一五七四吨）的百分之四十四以上；采煤效率平均超过解放前百分之十五，部分的超过一倍。所产之煤已大部销出，供给了陇海及津浦两铁路局，南京、上海、陇海西线、徐州等地区的燃料。
    该矿解放后第一年即获得这样大的成绩，主要原因是：一、经过职工训练班、业余学校的教育及劳大决议的传达学习等，工人觉悟大大提高。树立了新的劳动态度，发挥了生产积极性。全矿大部职工已参加了工会，部分参加了共产党及青年团。在共产党员和青年团员积极带头和推动下，使该矿生产效率大大提高。如第八劳合班，在去年十月的增产热潮中，由○·五二的采煤效率提高到○·八二吨。韩桥第一劳合班一、二、三组，原定产量是○·八吨，但经常完成一吨以上，创造了全矿的新纪录。当然，这一成绩的取得，和该矿取消了煤工中包工柜的非法剥削，以及实行多劳多得的工资政策也是分不开的。在里工中，机电科的全体工友，为保证矿山设备需要，一年内配制铸修了煤车、电泵、材料等四九九辆（部）。铸制镐头、道钉、螺丝二八一二四件。在韩桥、夏桥两矿增设了七处电器设备。二、该矿领导上逐步明确掌握执行了依靠工人阶级恢复发展生产的方针。在接收之初，因为对团结旧人员及对工人工资的处理缺乏依靠工人阶级的明确思想，经验不足，曾存在较严重的官僚主义作风，犯过错误。后来由于上级领导机关的不断帮助，和该矿干部间不断地进行批评和自我批评，逐渐明确了依靠工人阶级恢复发展生产的正确方针，使领导作风在去年下半年有显著的转变。七月份又召开了全矿工代大会，成立了煤矿管委会，吸收职工参加领导，开始实行民主管理，使工人积极性更进一步提高。三、支拨了很大的资金及人力，扩充了建设及改善了井下安全设备，保证了生产任务的完成。据不完全的统计：夏桥、韩桥两矿井上下全年共进行了运道、风道、防水、排水、提煤及职工宿舍、库房等矿井上下工程四十九处。共用人工二十万工以上。
    但该矿领导上目前仍有不少需改进的地方，如管委会的作用还不大，对安全问题重视不够，事故仍不断发生；领导方面会议多而解决问题少等。现该矿正进行全矿大评功，评出各部门生产功臣，进行奖励，并结合进行一年生产工作总结。
