    Teachers of the Affiliated Women's High School of Beijing Normal University Attend Each Other's Classes
    Exchange Experiences, and Improve Teaching Methods

    [This Newspaper reported] The Affiliated Women's High School of Beijing Normal University began mobilizing and organizing teachers of various subjects to attend each other's classes in November last year, and has achieved preliminary results in improving professional skills. The school plans to make this a regular part of its work in the future. At the beginning of this semester, some faculty and staff members who came from the old liberated areas, based on their experience at Yucai Middle School, proposed that teachers attend each other's classes to exchange experiences, improve professional skills, and improve teaching. However, many teachers had concerns about this, because in the old society, it was "disrespectful" for teachers to attend other teachers' classes. Only when a new teacher or a teacher who was teaching poorly would the school leader attend their class. At the same time, some teachers believed that "I have been teaching for decades, and I have taught well without attending classes. Attending classes is just a waste of time." Later, the school principal, academic affairs office staff, and some teachers who were willing to attend classes began attending classes individually, breaking the idea that being observed by other teachers would affect their teaching prestige. In early November, the school's teaching group leader joint meeting decided to organize teachers of all subjects to attend classes collectively in a planned way, and stipulated four items: (1) The attendees should be organized by the teaching group leaders, contact the lecturing teacher in advance, enter the classroom before the class starts, and leave the classroom after the class ends to avoid disturbing classroom order. (2) The attendees should adopt a learning attitude, not focus on finding fault with others, but sincerely and humbly absorb the advantages of others, and submit the discovered problems to the group for research to improve their professional skills. (3) The listening should focus on the teachers with more experience and better teaching, introduce their good experiences to the whole school and even outside the school. (4) Not only can classes be listened to within each subject, but classes can also be listened to between subjects to learn from each other's teaching experiences.
    After that, the Academic Affairs Office and various teaching groups tried to adjust the schedule to solve the time conflict between teachers' teaching and attending classes. The political group teachers first started collective class attendance on November 28, and teachers from other groups followed suit. The teaching group leader meeting also decided that collective class attendance was one of the central tasks in December.
    In the collective class attendance, each teacher had considerable gains: for example, mathematics class is generally considered not easy to be taught vividly, but mathematics group teachers found in the collective class attendance that one teacher taught very vividly: "brought geometry to life," so they all believed that being able to give good examples and improve students' interest can enhance the teaching effect. A political group teacher learned from the class attendance to use short and vivid stories to illustrate a problem, which was welcomed by the students. Some old teachers who had been teaching for decades discovered the advantages of young people from class attendance and were willing to raise questions and discuss them with everyone. Individual teachers who did not pay much attention to other people's opinions, seeing several teachers raise the same opinion to him, also humbly considered other people's opinions. The lecturers also benefited a lot from collective class attendance. A teacher who taught political science, in giving examples, some details were not considered thoroughly, after being raised by others, she was very satisfied; a Chinese language teacher, after being raised by other teachers, immediately supplemented the deficiencies of what was taught before in the second class, and won the unanimous praise of teachers and students.
    Teachers became more harmonious and united because of attending each other's classes. The teacher's lounge was very lively after class, discussing the experience and opinions of attending classes, and seemed more cordial, relaxed and happy. (Ding Ding)

    师大女附中教员互相听课
    交流经验教学方法改进
    【本报讯】北京师范大学女附中从去年十一月开始发动、组织各科教员互相听课，在提高业务上获初步成绩，该校并准备将此作为今后经常工作之一。本学期开始时，该校一部分由老解放区来的教职员，根据过去育才中学的经验，提出教员进行互相听课，以交流经验、提高业务、改进教学。但很多教员对此有顾虑，因为在旧社会里，教员听别人的课是“不恭敬”的事，除非新教员或教员教得不好时，才会由学校负责人去听他的课；同时，一部分教员认为“自己教了几十年书，没听过课也教得很好，听课只是白浪费时间”。以后，该校校长、教导处人员及一部分愿意听课的教师开始了个别听课，打破了过去一部分教员以为被别的教员听课就影响教课威信的想法。至十一月初，该校教学组长联席会议上决定有计划地组织各科教员集体听课，并规定四项：（一）听课的人由各教学组长组织，事先和讲课教员取得联系，上课前进教室，下课后出教室，以免扰乱教室秩序。（二）听课的人应抱着学习态度，不要专找别人缺点，而要诚恳虚心地吸取别人的优点，把发现的问题交小组研究，以改进业务。（三）听课应有重点，先听那些经验较多教得较好的教员的课，把好的经验介绍到全校以至校外。（四）不仅各科内可进行听课，各科互相间也可以听课，以互相学习教学经验。
    此后，教导处与各教学小组即设法调动课程表，解决教员间教课与听课的时间冲突。政治组教员于十一月二十八日首先开始了集体听课，其他组的教员随后亦相继进行。教学组长会议并决定集体听课为十二月份中心工作之一。
    在集体听课中，每个教员都有相当收获：如数学课一般认为是不容易讲得生动的，数学组教员在集体听课中，却发现有一位教员讲得很生动：“把几何讲活了”，因此都认为能讲出好的实例，提高学生的兴趣，就可以增强教学效果。政治组一位教员，从听课中学会了用简短生动的故事来说明一个问题，受到学生的欢迎。有的教了几十年书的老教员，从听课中发现了年青人的优点，肯提出问题和大家研究。个别不大重视别人意见的教员，见几个教员对他提出同样的意见，也就虚心考虑别人的意见了。讲课的人从集体听课里也得到不少好处。一位教政治课的教员，在举例时有些小节考虑不周，经过别人提出，她很满意；有一位国文教师经别的教员提出意见后，第二堂马上补充以前所教的欠缺处，获得师生同声赞扬。
    各教师间亦因互相听课而更融洽团结，下课后教员休息室里非常热闹，谈论着听课的心得与意见，显得更亲切、轻松、愉快。（丁丁）
