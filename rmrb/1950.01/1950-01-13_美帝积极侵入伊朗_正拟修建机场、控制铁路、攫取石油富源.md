    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: Tass, Beirut, 8th: The Iranian newspaper *Bakhtar-e Emruz* reports that, according to a plan drafted by the Americans, the US will build and renovate fourteen airports in Iran. Mehrabad Airport near Tehran is currently being expanded and re-equipped.
    Controlling Iran's major railway lines is also one of the US's strategic goals in Iran. The Tel Aviv newspaper *Al Ha-Mishmar* recently published a message stating that the Iranian government is negotiating with representatives from Washington to grant the US a 30-year concession on the Iranian railway linking the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf. Bandar Shahpur Port (the southern terminus of the railway) has virtually ceased commercial freight operations because it is now "under American control, and they are transporting arms and food through it to their bases in Iran."
    In addition to strategic goals, the US imperialists continue to seize Iran's oil resources. The Iranian newspaper *Tolu* pointed out that Mansur, chairman of the "Iranian Supreme Planning Committee," confirmed that an American company will soon be drilling oil wells in "Oilfields No. 1 and No. 2," which stretch across the northern provinces along the Caspian Sea.

    美帝积极侵入伊朗
    正拟修建机场、控制铁路、攫取石油富源
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社贝鲁特八日讯：伊朗报纸《巴赫达利·伊姆鲁兹》报道：依照美国人所拟定的计划，美将在伊朗建筑和改建十四个飞机场。德黑兰附近的麦赫拉巴德机场，现正在扩大及重新装备中。
    对伊朗各大铁路干线的控制，也是美国在伊朗的战略企图之一。特拉维夫的阿尔·哈米施玛尔报最近发表的消息称：伊朗政府正与华盛顿代表谈判在联结里海与波斯湾的伊朗大铁路上给美国以三十年的特许权。班德——沙普尔港（该铁路的南面的终点）实际上已停止商业上的货运，因为该地已在“美国人支配之下，他们把军火及食粮经由该地运往他们在伊朗的各基地去”。
    美帝国主义者在战略企图之外，还继续攫取伊朗的石油富源。伊朗《托鲁》报指出，“伊朗最高计划委员会”主席曼苏尔证实：一个美国公司不久即将在“第一号及第二号油田”开采油井，这两处油田绵亘于里海沿岸的北部各省。
