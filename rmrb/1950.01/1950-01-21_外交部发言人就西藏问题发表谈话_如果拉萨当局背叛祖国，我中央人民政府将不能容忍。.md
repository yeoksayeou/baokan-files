Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 20th: A reporter, in response to repeated propaganda by the US Associated Press that the Lhasa authorities in Tibet would dispatch a so-called "goodwill mission" to the United States, Britain, India, Nepal, and Beijing to demonstrate their "independence," interviewed the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, who made the following statement:

Tibet is a territory of the People's Republic of China. This is a fact that everyone in the world knows and no one has ever denied. That being the case, the Lhasa authorities certainly have no right to send any "mission" without authorization, let alone the right to demonstrate their so-called "independence." The "independence" of Tibet is to be publicized to the governments of the United States, Britain, India, and Nepal, and announced by the US Associated Press, making it easy to see that the content of this news, even if not fabricated by the Associated Press, is nothing more than a puppet show directed by US imperialism and its accomplices in the invasion of Tibet. The demand of the Tibetan people is to become a member of the democratic family of the People's Republic of China and to implement appropriate regional autonomy under the unified leadership of our Central People's Government, which is already stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. If the Lhasa authorities send representatives to Beijing to negotiate the peaceful liberation of Tibet under this principle, then such representatives will certainly be received. But if this is not the case, if the Lhasa authorities violate the will of the Tibetan people, accept the orders of imperialist aggressors, and send illegal "missions" to engage in activities to split and betray the motherland, then our Central People's Government will not tolerate such acts of betrayal of the motherland by the Lhasa authorities, and any country that receives such illegal "missions" will be considered to harbor hostility towards the People's Republic of China.

    外交部发言人就西藏问题发表谈话
    如果拉萨当局背叛祖国，我中央人民政府将不能容忍。
    【新华社北京二十日电】记者以美国合众社一再宣传西藏拉萨当局将派出所谓“亲善使团”分赴美、英、印度、尼泊尔和北京，以表明其“独立”一事，访问中央人民政府外交部发言人，承其发表谈话如下：
    西藏是中华人民共和国的领土，这是全世界没有人不知道也从没有人否认的事实。既然如此，拉萨当局当然没有权利擅自派出任何“使团”，更没有权利去表明它的所谓“独立”。西藏的“独立”要向美国、英国、印度、尼泊尔的政府去宣传，并由美国的合众社加以宣布，使人们不难看出这种消息的内容即令不是出于合众社的制造，也不过是美帝国主义及其侵略西藏的同谋们所导演的傀儡剧。西藏人民的要求是成为中华人民共和国民主大家庭的一员，是在我们中央人民政府统一领导下实行适当的区域自治，而这在人民政协的共同纲领上是已经规定了的。如果拉萨当局在这个原则下派出代表到北京谈判西藏的和平解放的问题，那么，这样的代表自将受到接待。但是如果不是这样，如果拉萨当局违反西藏人民的意志，接受帝国主义侵略者的命令，派出非法的“使团”从事分裂和背叛祖国的活动，那么，我国中央人民政府将不能容忍拉萨当局这种背叛祖国的行为，而任何接待这种非法“使团”的国家，将被认为对于中华人民共和国怀抱敌意。
