Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 12th: TASS, New York, January 11th: President Truman submitted to Congress on the 9th the draft of the US Federal Budget for the 1950-1951 fiscal year (from July 1st of this year to June 30th of next year, also known as the 1951 fiscal year), stating that, as in previous years, the funds for the Army, Air Force, and Navy, and the costs of pursuing the US policy of organizing military aggression blocs, as well as the expenses of arming the signatory countries of these blocs, account for the vast majority of the budget.

	Education and Health Appropriations Less Than Two Percent
    As pointed out in the President's message, these expenditures, together with expenditures related to the consequences of past wars (veterans' benefits), account for 71 percent of the total budget. As in the past, expenditures for insurance, education, health, and other needs of the people account for only a negligible portion of the US Federal Budget. For example, appropriations for education are no more than one percent. Health will receive less than one percent of the appropriations. And only one million dollars is prepared for the so-called "Truman Civil Rights Program," which has been heavily publicized. Only 5.1 percent of the budget is earmarked for all other social needs.

    The budget draft and the preliminary estimates provided in the President's message regarding the implementation of this year's budget reflect the decline in production and commerce that was unique to the United States in 1949. For example, in the budget draft for this fiscal year submitted by Truman a year ago, the estimated federal revenue for 1949-1950 was 41 billion US dollars, and the total expenditure was 41.858 billion US dollars. According to the budget draft, the deficit would not exceed 873 million US dollars. However, according to the figures revealed in the current President's message, the actual total revenue in this fiscal year only reached 37.763 billion US dollars. According to the materials used in the aforementioned message, federal expenditure will not be less than 43.297 billion US dollars this year. Therefore, the budget deficit for 1949-1950 will reach as much as 5.534 billion US dollars.

	New Budget Deficit to Exceed 5.1 Billion US Dollars

    The budget for the new 1950-1951 fiscal year anticipates a further reduction in revenue of 457 million US dollars. Total tax and other budget revenues are estimated to reach 37.306 billion US dollars, while expenditures will be 42.439 billion US dollars. Therefore, the budget draft for the new fiscal year has a deficit of 5.133 billion US dollars.

    Truman said in his message to Congress that he would soon propose amendments to laws and tax legislation to increase government revenue. The fact that the main tax burden will fall on the working people can be seen from the following figures: the budget draft stipulates that individual tax revenue will increase by 275 million US dollars.

    The budget draft shows that the continued deficit will further increase the debt of the US Federal Government, which will total 263.8 billion US dollars by the end of the 1950-51 fiscal year. The burden of this debt on US taxpayers can be seen from the fact that the Treasury Department pays 5.625 billion US dollars in interest on this debt each year, which is more than twice the total expenditure on education and insurance.

	Huge Military Spending is for Expanding Aggressive Armaments Domestically and Abroad

    The President's budget message admits that the largest item of expenditure in the new budget is appropriations for military needs ("Defense"). In the new budget, these expenditures total 13.545 billion US dollars (including 4.4 billion US dollars for the Navy, 4 billion US dollars for the Army, 3.9 billion US dollars for the Air Force, and 1.245 billion US dollars for other expenses), exceeding military spending in the current fiscal year by 400 million US dollars.

    The President's message also points out that under this budget, the total number of armed forces personnel will be greater than at any time since the end of demobilization after World War II. (The total active force will reach 1,507,000, plus 979,000 reservists).

    However, the funds listed under the "Defense" expenditure item in the budget do not include all government military spending. For example, 817 million US dollars for "developing atomic energy" is classified under the "developing natural resources" item in the budget, and the fact that "developing atomic energy" is purely military in nature in the United States is well known. In addition, the "developing natural resources" item also includes an appropriation of 563 million US dollars for the "non-military work" of the Army Corps of Engineers. The "transportation" expenditure item stipulates that 181 million US dollars will be used to "maintain coastal defense shipping equipment," 222 million US dollars for naval transportation, and 226 million US dollars for civil aviation, to build airports and modernize "air routes."

    In addition, not included in the military budget is the cost of universal military training, which was budgeted at 600 million US dollars last year. The President, in his message accompanying the budget draft, pointed out that "there is a need for a universal military training program." If Congress approves this program, the budget will need an additional 600 million US dollars.

    In addition, the "international affairs" expenditure item stipulates the delivery of weapons ("military aid") to the signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, totaling 1.148 billion US dollars.

    In the new budget, appropriations for the Marshall Plan and other foreign "aid" programs that militarize Western Europe total 3.25 billion US dollars.

    Agricultural expenses have been reduced by 450 million US dollars compared to this year. Despite the continuous decline in agricultural product prices, appropriations for the "Commodity Credit Corporation" have been reduced by 518 million US dollars. This company usually purchases agricultural products from farmers when market prices for agricultural products fall to a certain "parity level" (the so-called "parity level" is the amount of money farmers receive from selling agricultural products that can buy the same amount of things as they bought on average in 1910-1914). Transportation costs have been reduced by 212 million US dollars.

    Despite the increasing unemployment, unemployment relief in the new budget is only 243 million US dollars.

    杜鲁门提出一九五一年度预算草案
    招供美帝继续扩张侵略军备 
    有关军事费用和武装侵略集团费用占全部预算百分之七十一
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社纽约十一日讯：杜鲁门总统于九日提交国会的一九五○——一九五一会计年度（按由本年七月一日至明年六月三十日，亦称一九五一年度）美国联邦预算草案说明：像往年一样，陆军、空军和海军的经费和武装费，为奉行美国组织军事侵略集团政策的费用，以及武装这些集团的签字国的费用，占了预算的绝大部分。
            教育卫生拨款不足百分之二
    正如在总统咨文中所指出的，这些支出连同属于以往战争后果的支出（退伍军人扶助金）在内，共占全部预算的百分之七十一。和过去一样，保险、教育、卫生及人民其他方面的需要的支出，只占美国联邦预算中微不足道的部分。例如：教育拨款不多于百分之一。卫生方面将得到不足百分之一的拨款。并且只准备以一百万美元，用于曾经大肆宣传的所谓“杜鲁门民权纲领”。预算只有百分之五点一，规定用于其他一切社会需要。
    预算草案以及总统咨文中所提供关于执行本年度预算的初步估计，反映出美国在一九四九年所特有的生产与商业的跌落。例如，在杜鲁门一年以前所提交的本会计年度预算草案中，预计一九四九——一九五○年联邦收入是四百一十亿美元，而总支出为四百十八亿五千八百万美元。按照预算草案，赤字将不超过八亿七千三百万美元。但根据目前总统咨文所透露的数字来看，本会计年度中实际收入总额只达三百七十七亿六千三百万美元。而根据上述咨文所用的材料，联邦支出在本年内将不会少于四百三十二亿九千七百万美元，因此，一九四九——一九五○年度预算赤字，将达五十五亿三千四百万美元之多。
            新预算赤字将超过五十一亿美元
    一九五○——一九五一新会计年度预算，预料收入将再减少四亿五千七百万美元。估计总税收及其他预算收入，可达三百七十三亿零六百万美元，而支出将为四百二十四亿三千九百万美元。因此，新会计年度的预算草案中，有五十一亿三千三百万美元的赤字。
    杜鲁门在他致国会的咨文里说，他即将提出建议修改法律和税收立法，以增加政府收入。主要税收负担将落在劳动人民肩上这一事实，由下面的数字可以看出：预算草案规定个人税的收入将增加二亿七千五百万美元。
    预算草案显示，继续产生的赤字，将使美国的联邦政府的债务更形增加，这债务至一九五○——五一年财政年度结束时，总数将达二千六百三十八亿美元。这笔债务对美国纳税人的负担，可以从下面的事实看出：财政部每年对这笔债务付出的利息，达五十六亿二千五百万美元，即超过教育费、保险费两项开支总数一倍以上。
            巨大军费支出是为了在国内国外扩张侵略武装
    总统预算咨文承认：新预算中最大一项开支，是军事需要（“国防”）的拨款。在新预算中，这些开支总计一百三十五亿四千五百万美元（按其中海军四十四亿美元，陆军四十亿美元，空军三十九亿美元，及其他费用十二亿四千五百万美元），超过本财政年度军费四亿美元。
    总统咨文并指出，在这预算下，武装部队人员总数，将大于第二次大战后复员结束以来的任何时期。（按现役总兵力将达一百五十万零七千人，外加后备兵九十七万九千人）。
    但预算中列于“国防”费用项下的款项，并不包括全部的政府军事开支。例如，“发展原子能”的八亿一千七百万美元，在预算中归入“发展天然资源”项下，而“发展原子能”在美国纯属军事性质的这一事实，是人所共知的。此外，“发展天然资源”项下，还列有五亿六千三百万美元的拨款，用于陆军工兵部队的“非军事工作”。“交通运输”费项下规定有一亿八千一百万美元用于“维持海岸防御航运设备”，二亿二千二百万美元用于海军运输，二亿二千六百万美元用于民用航空，以建筑机场和把“航空线”现代化的。
    此外，没有列入军事预算的还有：普遍军训费，这笔费用在去年的预算中规定为六亿美元。总统在他的连同预算草案提出的咨文中，指出“需要有普遍军训计划”。如国会通过了这计划，预算就需要另加六亿美元。
    此外，“国际事务”费中规定有对《北大西洋公约》签字国家的武器交付（“军援”），共十一亿四千八百万美元。
    新预算中，使西欧军事化的马歇尔计划及其他对外“援助”计划的拨款，总数达三十二亿五千万美元。
    农业费用较本年削减了四亿五千万美元。尽管农产品价格不断下跌，但对“商品信贷公司”的拨款，减去了五亿一千八百万美元。该公司通常在农产品市场价格跌落到了某一“等价水准”时，向农民购买农产品（按所谓“等价水准”即农民出售农产品所得的钱可以买到的东西，与一九一○——一四年平均所买到的同样多的东西）。运输交通费减去了二亿一千二百万美元。
    尽管失业日益增加，新预算中的失业救济费，仅为二亿四千三百万美元。
