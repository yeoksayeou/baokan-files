Title: The Nine-tailed Fox's "Suite"

　　In Beijing residences, almost all have what are called "suites." Although each is used differently according to convenience, no one has any special feeling when mentioning the name "suite," much less thinks of any special meaning. However, if you've seen the Ping opera "Nine-tailed Fox," which has been performed for sixty-one shows, you'll have a special feeling when you hear the word "suite," perhaps even a shudder.
　　Although the Nine-tailed Fox is a female landlord, she possesses every evil that a landlord could have in feudal society. She has a large estate with a front hall and a back courtyard, and in the inner residence, there is a "suite." In this "suite," she locked up Little Stone (the only son of the peasant Shuanzi), who was to be buried with her husband; she locked up Little Juan, who was eventually beaten to death by her. Inside, she enshrined a fox spirit, but under the fox spirit's altar, she hid Shuanzi as a substitute for her husband. This is the source of her evil, and also the final cover for her crimes. Therefore, even several years after liberation, while burying her treasures under trees, she was still burying her evil in this "suite" that served as a fox spirit hall. In feudal society, this was a secret that the oppressed were not allowed to窥探 (peep into), like Bluebeard's secret chamber. However, in today's society where peasants have turned over, under the leadership of the Communist Party, this last fortress of feudalism, this secret den of evil, no matter how vicious and cunning the Nine-tailed Fox is, she cannot deny that it will eventually be discovered, broken into, and finally eliminated.
　　This is about feudal society. As for the so-called "suites" in capitalist society, those are small safes and large vaults, which are already invulnerable to fire, water, knives, and soldiers. They are also guarded by military police and protected by laws and even "morality." The so-called sacred and inviolable private property rights are many times more dignified than the "omnipotent" fox spirit hall. The evils hidden within are also many times heavier and even darker. However, we, the proletariat, already hold the key in our hands, and we will eventually break down the door, open the world's largest vault, tear down the plaque of private property rights, and wash away the bloody sins within. But that's a story for later.
　　However, speaking of this, one naturally thinks of us who come from the old society, especially intellectuals, whether we also have such feudal "suites" or capitalist safes in our ideology.
　　Of course, we do. Moreover, many people really regard them as "omnipotent" fox spirit halls or sacred and inviolable safes, not even realizing that they are secret dens hiding evil. We now not only possess the weapons to overthrow the feudal system and defeat imperialism, but these are also the keys to opening the "suites" and "safes" in our ideology. We have Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, as well as criticism and self-criticism. Whether it is a feudal "suite" or a capitalist "safe," it is not difficult to break into and open. Moreover, it will no longer be like Bluebeard's secret forbidden room, where one is annihilated upon entering, but instead, the secrets inside will be made public, so that the secrecy of this place will be lost forever, and countless people who were cruelly buried alive there, like Shuanzi, will be liberated together.
　　The Nine-tailed Fox's "suite" was only discovered and eliminated in the end; we must find the "suites" in our ideology like finding lesions, and discover the dog holes under the fox spirit hall. We must find our own, and also discover others', and work together to remove this, without being lenient or merciful.

    九尾狐的“套间”
    杨晦
    在北京的住宅里，差不多都有所谓“套间”的，虽然各随方便，各有不同的用处，在提起“套间”这个名称时谁也不会有什么特殊的感觉，更不会想到什么特殊的意义上去。但是，假使你看过那连续上演到六十一场的“九尾狐”的评戏了，你一听到说起“套间”来，一定会起特别的感觉，或许要悚然一惊的吧。
    九尾狐虽然是女地主，但是，在封建社会里的地主所能有的罪恶，她就样样俱全。她是家大业大，有前厅有后院，在内宅里还有一个“套间”。这个“套间”里，她锁过预备给她丈夫殉葬的小石头（农民拴子的独子），锁过终于被她毒打致死的小娟；这里边供的是狐仙，狐仙供桌底下却藏的是她做为丈夫替身的拴子。这是她的罪恶的渊薮，也是她罪恶的最后掩护。所以，在解放后好几年内，她一方面在树底下埋藏了她的财宝，也还在这个做为狐仙堂的“套间”里埋藏着她的罪恶。在封建社会里，这是不容许被压迫者窥探的秘密，跟蓝胡子的秘室一样。然而，在农民翻身的今天，在共产党的领导下，这封建的最后堡垒，罪恶的秘窟，无论九尾狐是怎样毒辣刁狡，也抵赖不过最后地被发现，被攻破，终于被肃清。
    这是封建社会的，至于资本主义社会的所谓“套间”，那是小的保险箱，大的保险库，本来已是水火刀兵所无可奈何的了，还加上宪兵警察的守护，法律甚至于“道德”的保障，所谓神圣不可侵略的私有财产权比狐仙堂的“有求必应”不知要尊严到多少倍。这中间所掩藏的罪恶也不知要重上多少倍，也要更黑暗到多少倍。然而，我们无产阶级的手里已经把握着那把钥匙，终于要破门而入，把世界上最大的那座保险库给开开，拆下那块私有产权的横匾，洗清那里边的血腥罪恶。这是后话不提。
    然而，一说到这里，自然要想到我们这些从旧社会来的，特别是知识分子，是不是在思想意识里也有这样封建式的“套间”，或者资本主义式的保险箱呢？
    当然有的。而且，有许多人真就当做“有求必应”的狐仙堂，或者当做神圣不可侵略的保险箱那样，并不自知那中间就是藏有罪恶的秘窟。我们现在不但掌有推翻封建制度和打倒帝国主义的武器，同时这也就是打开我们思想意识上的“套间”和“保险箱”的钥匙。我们有马列主义——毛泽东思想，也有批评和自我批评，无论是封建社会的“套间”还是资本主义的“保险箱”都是不难攻破而且打开。而且，也再不会像蓝胡子的那间秘密的禁室那样，打开门进去了就被消灭在那里，反会把那里边的秘密给公开出来，使这其间的秘密性从此失掉，使无数被残酷地活埋在那里边，像拴子似的人们一齐得到解放。
    九尾狐的“套间”是到最后才被发现，被肃清的；我们却要像找病灶一样地找到我们思想意识的“套间”，并且发觉那狐仙堂底下的狗洞，要找自己的，也要发现别人的，一同来把这给清除掉，不要姑惜，不要留情。
