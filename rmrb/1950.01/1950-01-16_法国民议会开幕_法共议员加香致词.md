Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 13th -- TASS, Paris, January 11th: The 1950 session of the French National Assembly was opened on the 10th, presided over by the oldest member, French Communist parliamentarian, Marcel Cachin. In his address, Cachin pointed out that since 1939, prices have increased by an average of twenty times, and the purchasing power of over ten million working people has been halved. At the same time, the profits of large corporations continue to increase. As a result, the situation of the working people has generally deteriorated, and social unrest in France is growing.
