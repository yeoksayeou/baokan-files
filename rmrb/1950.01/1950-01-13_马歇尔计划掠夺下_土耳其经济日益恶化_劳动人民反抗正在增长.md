Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: TASS, Moscow dispatch: The newspaper "Izvestia" published an article on the 6th by Osipov and Odintsov entitled "Marshallized Turkey," stating: Turkey's economy has completely succumbed to the interests of the United States. Managers of the American Mobil Oil Company, managing the Romanda and Adana regions (in southern Turkey), control Turkey's oil production plans and the distribution of petroleum products.

　　　　American Capital Controls Industry
American chromium magnates are taking effective measures to squeeze Turkish industrialists out of the mining industry in order to seize all of Turkey's chromium ore.
Turkey's exports are decreasing year by year. In 1949, Turkey's exports to the United States decreased by 13 percent compared to 1948, and exports to Italy decreased by more than 60 percent. Trade with the People's Democracies of Central and Southeastern Europe has virtually ceased.

　　　　Domestic Market Flooded with American Goods
The situation in the domestic market is even worse, as Americans have already gained a monopoly in the Turkish market. American goods flood the shops in Turkish towns and villages. Turkish merchants and manufacturers cannot compete with their American rivals and are forced to either curtail or completely stop production and trade.
Agricultural production in Turkey is also declining. In 1949, the sown area was 1,308,000 hectares less than in 1948. According to newspaper reports, the grain harvest in 1949 was 2,639,000 tons, while the harvest in 1948 was 4,853,000 tons.

　　　　Workers' Lives are Dramatically Declining
Turkey's military expenditure is enormous and difficult to accurately estimate. The total amount of regular army expenses for the 1950 fiscal year alone reached 458,274,454 lira (Turkish currency), accounting for 31.24 percent of the total budget. This has led to a large increase in the tax burden and a sharp rise in the cost of living. According to official materials from the Turkish Ministry of Economy and Commerce, the prices of food and consumer goods have risen by 500 to 600 percent compared to 1939. According to the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, the minimum cost of living is seven times the salary of a moderately skilled worker. The living conditions of unskilled workers are even worse.
The author concludes: Despite Turkey's tyrannical laws and police terror, the resistance of the working people is growing. In the largest industrial centers, workers are increasingly stopping work, holding protest rallies, demanding the abolition of anti-democratic decrees, a reduction of the working day, an increase in wages, and the abolition of the policy of turning Turkey into an American military bridgehead.

    马歇尔计划掠夺下
    土耳其经济日益恶化
    劳动人民反抗正在增长
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报六日刊登奥西波夫和奥丁佐夫所撰题为《马歇尔化的土耳其》专文称：土耳其的经济已完全屈从于美国的利益。管理着罗曼达与亚达那（在土耳其南部）地方的美国美孚油公司的经理们，控制了土耳其的油产计划和石油产品的分配。
            美国资本控制工业
    美国铬业大王正采取有效办法，把土耳其工业家从采矿工业中排挤出去，以夺取土耳其的全部铬矿。
    土耳其的出口一年比一年减少。一九四九年土耳其输往美国的货物，较一九四八年减少了百分之十三，输往意大利的减少了百分之六十强。对中欧与东南欧人民民主国家的贸易，实际上已经停顿。
            国内市场美货充斥
    国内市场的情况更坏，美国人业已取得土耳其市场的垄断权。美国货充斥土耳其城镇与乡村的商店。土耳其商人和制造商不能和美国敌手竞争，不是被迫紧缩，便是完全停止生产和贸易。
    土耳其农业生产也在下降。一九四九年较一九四八年少一百三十万八千公顷的播种面积。据报纸消息，一九四九年谷物收获量为二百六十三万九千吨，而一九四八年的收获量则为四百八十五万三千吨。
            工人生活剧烈下降
    土耳其军费庞大，难于正确估计。仅一九五零年度的军队经常费总数，即达四亿五千八百二十万七千四百五十四利尔（土币），占全部预算百分之三十一点二四。这就造成了赋税负担的大大增加和生活费的高涨。根据土耳其经济商务部的官方材料，食品与消费品价格已较一九三九年上涨了百分之五百到六百。据伊斯坦堡商会称：最低生活费如中等熟练工人的工资之七倍。不熟练工人的生活条件尤为恶化。
    作者结语称：尽管土耳其有暴虐的法律与警察恐怖，劳动人民的反抗正在增长。在最大的工业中心，工人们越来越多地停止工作，举行抗议集会，要求取消反民主法令缩短工作日，增加工资，取消将土耳其变成美国的军事桥头堡垒的政策。（附图片）
