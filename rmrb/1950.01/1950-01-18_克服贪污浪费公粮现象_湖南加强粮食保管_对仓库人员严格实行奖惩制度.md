    To Overcome Corruption and Waste of Public Grain
    Hunan Strengthens Grain Storage
    Implements Strict Reward and Punishment System for Warehouse Personnel
    [Our Newspaper] In response to instances of corruption and waste occurring in the collection, storage, and transportation of public grain across Hunan Province, the Hunan Provincial Grain Bureau has issued a notice to all regions emphasizing the establishment of inspection systems and the strengthening of education and management for cadres. The Grain Work Inspection Team of the bureau, during inspections of various counties, discovered that in over a hundred warehouses in Changsha and Xiangtan counties, there were issues such as grain being mixed with sand, stones, and water, grain being damp and on the verge of spoilage, and rodent damage being particularly widespread. In Xiangtan, seven cases of corruption and waste were also discovered. In addition, some warehouse cadres lacked a long-term perspective, lacked sufficient contact with the masses, and even warehouse cadres and grain collection work team cadres did not communicate with each other, and a few cadres lacked a sense of responsibility. For example, the Tianqu No. 16 Bao work team in Yisu District of Xiangtan County did not inspect the quality of the grain, accepting both good and bad. In Huanglong District, Qingtian Township, a typical storekeeper managed more than ten warehouses, lacking manpower and acting perfunctorily. When grain was delivered to the warehouse, it was not inspected. Some even privately distributed grain to the masses under the guise of supplementing office expenses, such as the No. 3 and No. 12 Bao in Xiaozhong Township and No. 7 Bao in Qingtian Township, distributing over 30 *shi* of grain to the masses. There were also individual personnel who became degenerate and corrupt, such as individual work team members and *bao-jia* personnel in Xiannv Township of Xiangtan who indulged in excessive eating and drinking. In Heqing Township, Liling County, during the autumn collection, many *bao* offices also engaged in excessive eating and drinking, wasting public grain in the same way. The five directly subordinate warehouses of the Hengyang Front Support Command, due to a shortage of manpower at the beginning, failed to conduct careful inspections, and good and bad, dry and wet public grain were stored together, resulting in spoilage. In addition, some cadres lacked grain management experience, resulting in a total loss and damage of 69,000 *jin* of grain. The Xishi Warehouse in Leiyang County collapsed due to excessive grain stacking, spilling over 80,000 *jin* of public grain and injuring ten people, one of whom died from their injuries. Theft of public grain also occurred in individual warehouses in Hanshou and Ningxiang counties.

    In response to the above situation, the bureau has issued a notice to all regions to prevent these problems as early as possible, so as to avoid continued losses of public grain. It also ordered that leaders at all levels send personnel to conduct inspections on a rotating basis at any time, and that the personnel allocation for all aspects of public grain collection, storage, and transportation should, as far as possible, be properly equipped with leading cadres in each department or region, and that cadre education should be strengthened. Each department can establish living groups to carry out criticism and self-criticism, so as to improve the political level and work efficiency of cadres. It is stipulated that the allocation of grain must be handled in accordance with the prescribed procedures (county allocation orders or valid grain coupons). All warehouses should accurately calculate their capacity and avoid excessive stacking to prevent collapse; if the masses deliver bad grain, the reasons should be explained and the grain refused. After the grain is put into storage, the custodians should regularly and automatically inspect it, maintain close contact with the local masses, absorb grain storage experience, and jointly consult on preventing bandits and thieves and being careful of fire. Grain storage committees should be established as far as possible, absorbing poor and hired peasants and primary school teachers to participate in the storage and play a supervisory role. A strict reward and punishment system should be implemented for warehouse personnel, and those that are not sound should be gradually rectified. Those who have been found to be truly corrupt should be dealt with according to the severity of the case, recovering the stolen goods, dismissing them from their posts, or sending them to the court for punishment; those who have achieved good results in storing public grain and have a positive attitude towards their work should be commended, so as to play a demonstrative and encouraging role. It is essential to ensure that public grain does not suffer any undue losses.

    克服贪污浪费公粮现象
    湖南加强粮食保管
    对仓库人员严格实行奖惩制度
    【本报讯】湖南省粮食局为该省各地公粮征收保管运输工作中，发生贪污浪费现象，特通报各地注意树立检查制度，加强干部教育管理。该局检查粮食工作队进行各县检查时，发现长、潭两县百余个仓库谷内存在着搀砂、搀石、搀水、谷质潮湿，粮食行将霉烂等现象，鼠耗则更加普遍。湘潭并发现贪污浪费现象七起。此外，有些仓库干部，思想上不作长期打算，与群众联系不够，甚至仓库干部与征粮工作队的干部也互不联系，以及少数干部责任心不强。如湘潭易俗区天衢十六保工作队，不检查谷质，好坏都收，黄龙区清田乡一般的一个保管员管理十余个仓，人手不够，加以办事敷衍塞责，粮够入库时，不加检查。有的还用弥补办公费的名义，私自向群众派谷，如晓忠乡三保、十二保及清田乡七保，向群众派谷三十余石。还有个别人员堕落腐化，如湘潭仙女乡个别工作队员和保甲人员大吃大喝等。醴陵县河清乡在秋征中很多保办公处，亦发生大吃大喝，浪费公粮同样情形。衡阳支前司令部五个直属仓库，开始时人手少不及仔细检查，公粮好坏干湿装在一起，致粮食腐烂，加上某些干部缺乏管粮经验，损失和损坏粮食共六万九千斤。耒阳县新市仓库因堆粮过多倒塌，倾出公粮八万余斤，并压伤十人，一人因伤致死。汉寿、寗乡等县个别仓库并曾发生公粮被盗。
    该局针对以上情况，特通报各地及早防止，以免公粮继续遭受损失。并着令各地领导上，随时派员轮回检查，对于公粮征收、保管、运输各方面的人事配备，尽可能每一部门或地区，妥善配备领导骨干，并加强干部教育，各部门可建立生活小组，展开批评与自我批评，提高干部政治水平与工作效率。规定拨付粮食必须按照规定手续（县的支拨命令或有效粮票）办理。各仓库应确实计算容量，不要过量多装，以免倒塌；群众如有送坏粮的应说清道理拒收。粮食入库后，保管人员应经常自动检查，并与当地群众密切联系，吸收保管粮食经验，及共同协商防匪防盗小心火烛，尽可能设置公粮保管委员会，吸收贫雇农民及小学教员参加保管，并起监督作用。对仓库人员则严格实行奖惩制度，不健全的应逐渐整顿，已发觉确实贪污人员，应分别轻重，追赃撤职或送法院惩办；凡保管公粮有成绩，工作态度积极的人员，应予以表扬，以收示范鼓励作用。务使做到不使公粮受到任何不应有的损失。
