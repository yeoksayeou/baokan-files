Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 20th: According to a report in the Bangkok Quanmin Bao on December 23rd of last year, citing a Rangoon dispatch: The Burmese People's Democratic Allied Forces liberated Ingapu town in the north of Henzada, northwest of Rangoon, on November 14th, destroying two Karen Self-Defense Force military vehicles. The Democratic Allied Forces also liberated the town of Letpantan, under the jurisdiction of Henzada, at the same time, and have established a people's court in the town.

Recently, the People's Democratic Allied Forces have been continuously attacking the Karen Self-Defense Forces in Pyu. On December 12th, the Democratic Allied Forces near Pyu launched a night raid on the Karen Self-Defense Force headquarters and ammunition depot on the outskirts of Pyu. They engaged in fierce fighting with the Karen Self-Defense Forces in the Pyu port area for an hour and a half, killing 600 Karen Self-Defense Forces, capturing four members of the Karen Self-Defense Force commander's guard, and seizing 600 rifles.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 20th: The strike movement of Indonesian working people protesting against the slave labor conditions formulated by the American and Dutch imperialists and the Hatta clique is growing day by day. According to a TASS dispatch from The Hague: Strike movements are increasing daily in various parts of Indonesia. In Jakarta, thousands of workers are on strike. In Medan, Sumatra, tens of thousands of workers have stopped work. The entire cargo transportation of North Sumatra has been paralyzed. Dozens of ships that have not been unloaded are docked in the port. According to an Antara news agency dispatch from Medan, the strike by dockworkers at Belawan harbor east of Medan is still ongoing as of the 18th. The ruling class is using the army and plantation workers to sabotage the strike. According to an Associated Press report: Workers at the Mobil Oil Company near Palembang in southern Sumatra have also staged a "sit-down strike" demanding higher wages and completely shut down on the 10th. The strike has resulted in a daily loss of 65,000 barrels of oil production for the company.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 20th: The treasonous activities of the Indonesian puppet clique are increasing. According to an Antara news agency dispatch: An agreement has been reached in Jakarta to incorporate Indonesian officers and soldiers from the Dutch colonial army into the "United States Army." The Dutch colonial army will thus become the backbone of the armed forces of the Republic of the United States of Indonesia. In the economic sphere, Juanda, the Minister of Economy of the Indonesian puppet government, flew to the United States on the 17th, with the task of "requesting loans from the Export-Import Bank" (Associated Press). According to a TASS dispatch from The Hague on the 17th, the Hatta government has invited German banking representatives Bruecher and Holtatt to work in Jakarta as financial advisors. Agence France-Presse reported: These Westerners are well-known in the Netherlands because they controlled the Dutch National Bank during the German occupation of the Netherlands.

Indonesian patriots are resisting the traitorous acts of the puppet clique by persisting in armed struggle. According to a TASS dispatch on the 17th: Fighting between the Dutch colonial army and Indonesian patriots is continuing in Java. Small-scale battles are taking place in the vast area between Semarang and Cirebon. There is also fighting in areas 30 kilometers from Jakarta.

    最近时期，人民民主联军曾不断向庇古以北良礼彬的克伦自卫队进攻。十二月十二日，在良礼彬附近的民主联军，曾于夜间冲入良礼彬外围，向克伦自卫队的司令部和弹药库进攻，并在良礼彬埠区内和克伦自卫队激战一小时半，击毙克伦自卫队六百名，俘虏克伦自卫军军长的卫队四名，缴获步枪六百支。
    【新华社北京二十日电】印尼劳动人民抗议美、荷帝国主义者与哈达集团所制订的奴隶劳动条件的罢工运动，正在日益增涨中。据塔斯社海牙消息称：印尼各地罢工运动正在日益增长。在雅加达，数以千计的工人正在进行罢工。在苏门答腊岛的棉兰，有成千上万的工人已停止工作。整个北苏门答腊的货物运输，已陷于麻痹。数十艘未卸货的船舶，停在港内。另据安尼塔通讯社棉兰消息，在棉兰以东的勿老湾码头工人的罢工，迄十八日止仍在坚持中。统治阶级正在利用军队与庄园工人来破坏这一罢工。又据美联社消息：苏门答腊南部巨港附近的美孚油公司的工人，亦因要求增加工资而举行“静坐罢工”，并于十日完全停闭。这次罢工使该公司油产量每日损失六万五千桶。

    印尼爱国者以坚持武装斗争来反对傀儡集团的卖国行为。据塔斯社十七日消息：荷兰殖民军与印尼爱国者之间的战事，正在爪哇继续进行中。在三宝垅与井里汶间的广大地区上，正在进行着小规模的战斗。距雅加达三十公里的地区，也有战事。
