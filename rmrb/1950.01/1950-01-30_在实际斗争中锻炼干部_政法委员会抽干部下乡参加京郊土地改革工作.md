    Train Cadres in Actual Struggle
    Political and Legal Affairs Committee Sends Cadres to the Countryside to Participate in Land Reform Work in the Suburbs of Beijing
    [By Our Own Correspondent] The Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Government Administration Council, in order to train and cultivate cadres in actual struggle, has specifically selected a group of cadres from its existing staff to go to the countryside and participate in the second phase of land reform work in the suburbs of Beijing. A total of 48 from the Political and Legal Affairs Committee, 9 from the Ministry of Justice, 12 from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and 3 temporarily dispatched from the Supreme People's Procuratorate, making a total of 72 people, mostly intellectuals who have recently joined the workforce. They formed a large team, divided into seven groups, and set off excitedly on the 24th to the 13th district of the suburbs of Beijing to cooperate with the district's work team in participating in land reform work. Tao Xijin, Secretary-General of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee, gave a speech on the 23rd, explaining the significance of sending staff to the countryside and the attitude they should adopt; pointing out that intellectuals must be reformed and can certainly be reformed, and the key lies in whether they are determined to put aside their airs. He also emphasized that the staff of the political and legal system should have a high degree of class consciousness in order to carry out the political and legal work correctly. The main purpose of going to the countryside this time is to train them. We will strengthen the theoretical and policy learning of cadres in service on the one hand, and rotate cadres to go deep into the workers and peasants to train and conduct on-the-spot investigations and research on the other hand. This will be our basic method for training political and legal cadres in service at present.

    在实际斗争中锻炼干部
    政法委员会抽干部下乡参加京郊土地改革工作
    【本报讯】政务院政治法律委员会为在实际斗争中锻炼与培养干部，特就现有工作人员中，抽出一批干部下乡，参加京郊第二期土地改革工作。计政法委员会四十八名，司法部九名，内务部十二名，最高人民检察署临时亦派三人参加，共七十二人，大多数系新参加工作的知识分子。他们组成一个大队，下分七个组，于二十四日兴奋地出发，赴京郊第十三区，配合该区工作组，参加土地改革工作。政法委员会陶希晋秘书长于二十三日召集讲话，说明派遣工作人员下乡的意义与应有的态度；指出：知识分子必须改造而且一定能改造，关键在于有无决心放下架子。并强调政法系统的工作人员，应当有高度的阶级觉悟，才能使政法工作正确地开展，此次下乡主要目的是锻练。我们一方面加强在职干部理论政策的学习，一方面轮回派遣干部深入工农群众中去锻练和实地调查研究，这将是我们目前培养政法在职干部的基本方法。
