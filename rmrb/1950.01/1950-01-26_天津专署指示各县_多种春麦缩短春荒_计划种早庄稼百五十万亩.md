    Tianjin Special District Directs All Counties
    To Plant More Spring Wheat to Shorten the Spring Famine
    Plans to Plant 1.5 Million Mu of Early Crops
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Due to the severe flooding in the Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province last year, 78.4% of the total cultivated land was flooded. Coupled with disasters such as freezing, insects, hail, and wind, the harvest was reduced, resulting in serious living difficulties for the broad masses. Although 3.6 million mu of autumn wheat was planted last autumn, some areas were not completely drained of water, and the autumn wheat was not fully planted. In order to shorten the spring famine, the Special District specifically instructed all counties to actively lead the masses to plant more early-maturing crops. It is planned that the entire special district will plant 1.5 million mu of spring wheat, barley, and peas, and is preparing to lend 400,000 jin of seeds. Investigations are now underway to determine the loan recipients and to transport the seeds.

    天津专署指示各县
    多种春麦缩短春荒
    计划种早庄稼百五十万亩
    【本报讯】河北省天津专区因去年水灾严重，被淹土地达总耕地面积的百分之七十八点四，加上冻、虫、雹、风等灾害，收成减少，致造成广大群众严重的生活困难。去秋虽种麦三百六十万亩，但因有些地积水没有脱净，秋麦没有种齐。专署为缩短春荒，特指示各县积极领导群众多种早熟庄稼。计划全专区种春麦、大麦、豌豆一百五十万亩，并准备贷种籽四十万斤，现已开始调查贷种对象和调运种籽。
