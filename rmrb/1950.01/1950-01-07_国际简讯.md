    Further Achievements in East German Metallurgy
    Publicly owned metallurgical enterprises in the German Democratic Republic have achieved further successes. The Max-Hütte factory ranked first in the publicly owned steel industry's enterprise labor competition, completing 31 percent of its annual production plan in the last quarter of 1949. Among metal rolling mills, the Oberhausen factory ranked first, with production exceeding December's plan by 57 percent. Among die-casting factories, the Gießereimonitor factory ranked first, exceeding December's plan by 62 percent. Among factories producing rough castings, the Gröditz factory ranked first, with workers exceeding December's plan by 48 percent.
    The Polish coal mining industry completed its full-year production plan for 1949 on December 31. In 1949, Poland's coal production increased by 7.2 percent compared to pre-war levels. The Polish coal mining industry not only completed its 1949 plan but also exceeded the three-year plan by 2.3 percent.
        Soviet-Norwegian Agreement to Resolve Border Disputes
    On December 29, the Soviet government and the Norwegian government signed an agreement in Oslo, Norway, regarding the Soviet-Norwegian border system and the system for resolving border disputes and accidental incidents.
    The French Association of Scientific Workers passed a resolution at the beginning of the year, strongly condemning the recent attacks on Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Research Commission. The resolution stated that these attacks not only threaten Curie himself but also threaten France's independent research into the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The French Association of Scientific Workers demanded that those who dare to use atomic weapons first in wartime be declared criminals against humanity.
    The British Democratic Youth Organization, affiliated with the World Federation of Democratic Youth, passed a resolution on the 1st, protesting the death sentences pronounced by the royalist fascist court against sixteen democratic Greek students.
    Due to the decline in prices of Finnish agricultural products and the rise in prices of industrial products, small farmers' incomes are steadily decreasing. From late 1948 to September 1949, the wholesale price index for industrial products increased by 66 points, but the meat price index fell by 175 points. In the winter of 1948 to 1949, due to the fall in timber prices, the income of general small farmers decreased by 7 to 8 billion Finnish marks. Currently, timber prices continue to fall, and Finnish agriculture is suffering even heavier losses than last year.
    The Director of the Bureau of Employment Security of the U.S. Department of Labor, Goodwin, stated that the number of people applying for unemployment insurance benefits and continuing to apply for unemployment insurance benefits since November of last year has increased significantly compared to October, averaging 344,634 applications per week. In October, the average was 312,144 applications per week.
