Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th. TASS, Moscow: *The Labour Newspaper* recently published a London dispatch by Lippmann, describing the life and struggle of British workers, stating: The Marshall Plan placed a heavy burden on the British national economy. The "Western European Union" and the North Atlantic Treaty brought about a huge increase in military spending. The Labour government and right-wing trade union leaders systematically attacked the living standards of the working class. Even official figures admit that the price of manufactured goods has risen by 145.5 percent, and food and tobacco by 119.3 percent. The British people now receive only 350 grams of meat per week. The consumption of butter and other fats has also decreased. Some important foods, such as rice and canned vegetables, disappeared as early as three years ago. Since the devaluation of the pound, Attlee has submitted a plan to the House of Commons to cut spending, with housing construction plans reduced by 35 million pounds annually, and education funding reduced by 5 million pounds. Under harsh working conditions, diseases are rampant among workers, especially in the mining and pottery industries. Employers avoid using capital to improve working conditions, instead adopting an "acceleration" system in order to obtain extraordinary profits. The British working people bear the main burden of the Labour government's gambling policy of preparing for a new war. At the same time, the excess profits of monopoly capital, which have become rich from engaging in the arms race, have greatly increased. The Labour government's imperialist policy spends billions of pounds to suppress national liberation movements in the colonies. Before the war, maintaining foreign troops cost 16 million pounds annually. In the three years after the war—from 1946 to 1948—the total reached a huge sum of 691 million pounds.
    The sharp deterioration of the living conditions of the working people has aroused deep dissatisfaction, which is manifested in large-scale strikes by the working class. In 1949, British miners, railway workers, and dockworkers all held strikes. They demanded increased wages, improved living conditions, and abandonment of the arms race and the policy of yielding to American capital. The government and the reactionary leaders of the British Trades Union Congress took all measures to sabotage the strike movement and split the working class. However, the strike movement is still rising and expanding, and the unity of the workers is becoming more and more powerful. The British working class has given a more powerful counterattack to the capital's offensive. They are tightening their ranks to carry out an increasingly sharp class struggle.

    工党政府向美国资本屈膝
    英工人生活急剧恶化
    英国工人阶级正在严密自己的队伍，以进行日益尖锐的阶级斗争。
    【新华社北京六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报顷刊载李普曼的伦敦通讯，描述英国工人生活及斗争的情况称：马歇尔计划给英国国家经济以苛重的负担，“西欧联盟”和北大西洋公约又带来了军费开支的巨大增加，工党政府和右翼工会领袖，对工人阶级的生活标准进行了有系统的攻势。即使官方的数字也承认，制造品的价格已上涨了百分之一四五·五，食粮和烟草上涨了百分之一一九·三。英国人民现在每周仅能得到三五○公分的肉。牛油和其他脂肪的消费也都下降。某些重要的食粮，如像大米和罐头蔬菜，则早在三年以前就看不到了。从英镑贬值以后，艾德礼向下院提出了削减开支的计划，房屋建筑计划每年削减了三千五百万镑，教育经费削减了五百万镑。在艰苦的工作条件下，工人中疾病蔓延甚烈，特别是在采矿、陶器等工业中。雇主们避免把资本用来改善劳动条件，反而采行“加速”制度，以期获得非常的利润。英国劳动人民负担着工党政府准备新战争的赌博政策的主要负担。同时，以从事军备竞赛而致富的垄断资本的超额利润却大大上升。工党政府的帝国主义政策花费亿万镑的金钱来镇压殖民地的民族解放运动，战前，维持国外军队每年用一千六百万镑。而在战后三年——从一九四六到一九四八年间，总数却达到六亿九千一百万镑的庞大数目。
    劳动人民情况的急剧恶化，已引起了深刻的不满，这种不满表现于工人阶级的大规模罢工中。一九四九年，英国的矿工、铁路工人、码头工人都举行了罢工。他们要求增加工资、改善生活条件、放弃军备竞赛及对美国资本屈膝的政策。政府和英国职工大会的反动领袖采取一切措施破坏罢工运动，分裂工人阶级。但是，罢工运动仍在高涨、扩大，工人的团结日益有力。英国工人阶级对资本的攻势给了更加有力的反击，他们正在严密自己的队伍，以进行日益尖锐的阶级斗争。
