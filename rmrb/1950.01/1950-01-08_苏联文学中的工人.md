    Soviet workers, the vanguard of the Soviet people, have traversed a long path of progress during the years of socialist construction. In the Soviet Union, conditions for the full development of individual abilities and the enjoyment of a full life have been created, and a tremendous change has occurred in the social attitude toward labor. This social attitude toward labor has become a source of satisfaction for individual creativity, no matter which department one works in. Everyone chooses their profession according to their liking, and the main motivation is their desire—how to further improve their skills and proficiency, how to accelerate the pace of construction.

    In the process of socialist labor, people's horizons are broadened, because new qualities have been formed in them. Molotov said in a speech: "The spiritual characteristics of the Soviet people today are primarily manifested in a conscious attitude towards their work, and they feel that their work has important social significance..."

    The education of Soviet workers reaches higher levels year after year. The forms of education are diverse. There are various schools where workers can study in their spare time, such as technical schools, night schools, correspondence schools, etc. Everyone can obtain opportunities for continuous progress and development. Today's machinists can become foremen, even engineers, tomorrow. This is already extremely common in Soviet industry.

    The path of development of Soviet workers over the past thirty years is clearly reflected in literature.

    It has been almost a quarter of a century since F. Gladkov's novel "Cement" was published. But the characters it portrays are still very fresh and moving. The important role of its main character, Gleb Chumalov, is even clearer against the backdrop of history.

    He is a worker who has been tempered by the revolution and the civil war. When he returns to his factory, he brings new consciousness. He no longer feels that he is an exploited, humble person, but the master of production, and he feels that production must be restored as soon as possible. The factory was half destroyed. Chumalov couldn't help but feel heartbroken when he saw the factory's scene: weeds covered the grounds, rusted machines were lying crooked in the deserted factory buildings, and a deathly, desolate atmosphere permeated the surroundings.

    The tragic scene of this dead factory moved Gleb. He was seized by an irresistible desire to start working immediately, to make the factory serve the new society immediately. He suffered deeply and was furious because his comrades had not been able to protect the factory properly.

    Chumalov never hesitates or compromises when he encounters differences in principle. His outstanding character attracts readers. He does not know hesitation. Communist ideals inspire him. He is not the kind of person who will fall down or be stopped by obstacles, because he has unlimited confidence in the creative abilities of the working class. He accepts the policies of the Bolshevik Party as if they were an organic part of himself. It has become his personal matter, and he promotes it with all his heart.

    Gladkov shows us several sides of this character in his portrayal. In terms of family life, Chumalov is not perfect. He did not immediately adapt to his wife Dasha's liberation. When he finally understood that she, too, was working for that great goal, the interests he cared about most, he overcame his jealousy of his wife and his psychology of controlling her, and regained her love.

    Gladkov brilliantly depicts the picture of the solidarity of the working class, and he shows the workers' respect and admiration for a comrade who uses his strength and will to help them build a happy life.

    "Cement" depicts the beginning of construction, how the destroyed land is revived. Gladkov's next novel, "Energy," depicts the progress of this great new construction.

    The Soviet people learned new and advanced techniques, and the entire country was swept up in a wave of construction.

    The novel "Energy" depicts the construction of the famous hydroelectric power station on the Dnieper River. The novel gives us a broad picture of forty thousand collective workers participating in this great project. The author writes about various different and vivid characters. Not everyone has the same thoughts, not everyone sees the world with the same eyes. But the vast majority of them have the same passion—that is: to move forward, overcome all obstacles on the road, and ensure the rapid victory of socialism.

    How yesterday's workers struggled to sort out the ruins and restore production. Today we see him engaged in new construction, in the course of which he gains new qualities. He grows and develops. He fully understands and supports all complex struggles for the socialist construction of our country. The character of the Bolshevik worker, the person upon whom the success of the construction project depends—the organizer of the broad masses—is expressed more deeply in this struggle.

    The protagonist of "Energy," Party Secretary Vatagin, belongs to the same generation as Gleb Chumalov, but in several respects he surpasses Chumalov.

    The protagonist's character is powerfully expressed in the novel "Energy" in the description of his practical actions. These actions constitute the meaning of his entire life. He clearly understands how people can make themselves happy, and he is willing to win this happiness as soon as possible.

    The author shows with great persuasiveness that this new type of person has the greatest concern for the goals of the country and production work.

    It is not just the main character, but all those engaged in the huge project who are advancing bravely. The author portrays the development of the people's creativity. This is powerfully expressed in the descriptions of several scenes of workers' meetings discussing production plans. Saboteurs among the engineers frantically opposed the workers' plans. The objections they raised from a technical standpoint seemed almost impossible to answer. But the workers crushed their obstruction. They used their own calculations, based on the experience of shock work, to oppose the technical calculations of the engineers with reactionary consciousness.

    In the vividly depicted cement worker Katya Batchekova, the author expresses the creative character of Soviet female workers. At the same time, in her character, the author also shows the new mental state unique to the Soviet people.

    Katya does not just mechanically go to work and leave work on time, she does not think that work is just for life. She regards her work as a public undertaking, with which she has a close personal relationship. Because this project is hers and the people's! Every Soviet person has to point out the shortcomings when he sees them, and try to express his opinions as much as possible! It is this characteristic that forms the strength of the Soviet system, Soviet democracy and its indestructibility. The author embodies this force in the characters of his novels.

    Gladkov's two novels describe the story of the Soviet working class and the Bolshevik Party in the process of creating a new life. The role of the Party as an organizer and ideological leader of the masses is expressed here in vivid action.

    The 1920s and early 1930s were a period when the capitalist world was experiencing a severe economic panic, while the Soviet Union was developing forward, establishing more and more new factories throughout the country, and forming the historically famous socialist competition. This fact naturally became the subject of many major works by Soviet writers. Leonov's "Sot" and Kataev's "Time, Forward!" depict the early stages of this great competition.

    The heroic efforts of the working class, the builders of socialism, are successfully portrayed in V. Ilyenkov's "The Engine Axle" and "City of Sunlight," and Klimov's "Tanker Derbent," "The Engineer," and some other talented works.

    We see the working class embarking on the broad road of creative activity.

    During these years, a new force of the working class grew up. Young people educated by the spirit of the working class's finest traditions brought new impetus, a thirst for labor, and great creativity. All these qualities were applied to the construction of new cities, new factories, machines and tractor stations, and state farms.

    A brilliant example is the establishment of the famous Komsomol city on the Amur River. A city stands on the vast tundra that was originally uninhabited, built entirely by the hands of Soviet youth. It took great courage, enthusiasm, and willpower to carry out this task in a relatively short period of time and under difficult conditions in the virgin forest area. This is the theme of V. Ketlinskaya's novel, which is aptly titled "Courage."

    This novel uses a huge canvas to show how four hundred members of the Komsomol, these flowers of Soviet youth, came to the tundra from all over the country and participated in the construction of the city on the bank of a river that was prone to flooding.

    The young people not only came to work with youthful vitality, but also possessed the highest socialist morality and deep love for this work.

    The novel unfolds a series of exciting scenes to the reader. We see the working meeting in the office of Party Secretary Morozov. Now this city only exists on the map, just a red dot. This dot attracts the attention of all the young builders. They listen to every word their older comrades say. Morozov said:

    "There is nothing here... you!" He emphasized, "You will build a city here, build many factories and a new life... In the beginning, the conditions will be difficult. But this area is good. If we develop it, it will become a rich and beautiful place... You must understand this. You must learn to love it..."

    He told them this frankly, without hiding anything. Let them know their situation. For anything, from beginning to end, they must do it with their own hands. For themselves and for future generations.

    The young people thus realized this ideal. They camped on the bank of the Amur River and began to build a new city and factory.

    The spiritual state of the young builders is fully expressed in the language of the heroine of the novel, Klava. "A person who does not dream of the future, does not see any goals, and does not try to build his country into a happy socialist country, is a narrow and insignificant person."

    The Soviet working class is confidently moving forward, building new cities and factories across the country. The character of the worker in the new stage of development is now expressed in Gladkov's new novel "Oath," which he wrote during the period of the Patriotic War. The author shows how Soviet men and women fulfilled their great oath to defeat the enemy.

    The protagonists of this book are the sons and grandsons of the leading figures in "Cement." They grew up under new conditions. They build giant factories using the latest technology. They are educated by socialist society, they steadily improve their work standards, and they represent a new type of worker.

    The central character of the novel is lathe operator Shalonov. In this character, the author crystallized the most typical characteristics of modern Soviet workers: he is deeply interested in his work and deeply loves his country. Shalonov is a cultured person in the broadest sense of the word. He is not only a perfect master of his business, but also has a high level of political awareness and is very familiar with literature. The Soviet system has created the necessary conditions for developing individual talents. Shalonov is not only a skilled worker, but also a talented inventor.

    The solidarity of the Soviet people is clearly expressed in this book. The factory where Shalonov worked moved from Leningrad to the Urals, which is the oldest industrial center in the Soviet Union. The Ural people gave their Leningrad comrades a brotherly welcome and did everything they could to help them obtain the best working conditions.

    Gladkov writes "Oath" in the form of a diary written by Shalonov. This makes the protagonist's speech more persuasive, and these words reveal the depth of the Soviet people's morality, the soul of his heroism, and show that in him, private and public interests are combined into a harmonious whole.

    The protagonist of Gladkov's novel is a typical character in real life. People like Shalonov are constantly growing in the Soviet Union. This is also reflected in recent literary works. These characteristics are also expressed in the characters in Babaev's novel "Steel and Slag" and Azhayev's "Far from Moscow." These two works represent the type of Soviet worker who is advancing. The prominent characteristics of Azhayev's protagonist are perseverance, fortitude, and the ability to overcome all difficulties.

    What is the source of the strength of the workers who are gathered together to build a pipeline, and their leaders, Batmanov and Bledzy? It is due to their unity, unified goals, strict discipline, and their high degree of socialist consciousness. Everyone knows that the interests of the country are his own interests.

    This construction work did not have telephones to provide the necessary transportation. Engineer Tanya Vasilchenko asked the Komsomol for help, and immediately she received a team of young people who volunteered to lay the wires. They completed the task in just six weeks, installing a power line across the prairie to the farthest work station.

    Secondly, there were no roads. Tractor driver Shirin and truck driver Smochkov took on the task of opening a road in the deep snow. They worked hard through hundreds of miles of road. Apart from themselves, no one else could be found to help them fight the blizzard. As a result, they completed it victoriously.

    All of this, and other undertakings, can only be successful in a socialist country. The protagonists of these novels are driven and inspired by the interests of the country. When Shirin and Smochkov started to open a road, they were not thinking about what they would earn on this difficult journey, or what losses they would suffer if they did not. What they were concerned about was that they knew that the construction of this pipeline was very important to the country, and they were eager to share a part of the work in accelerating the completion of this construction task.

    Azhayev's protagonists are completely devoid of the mentality of people in the old private society. They look at the world and their own work, first of all, from a public point of view. It is on this basis that the mentality of people in socialist society is formed.

    The working class is the creator of new material value and the builder of a new society. These novels show us the worker at his machine, in his family, in his social obligations, and in war.

    Broad vision, courageous creativity, leaping imagination, combined with sober work efficiency, patience, and warm friendship and concern for working comrades—these are the characteristics of the Soviet worker expressed in artistic images in Soviet literature.

    苏联文学中的工人
    Ｍ·希格林  作  袁水拍  译
    作为苏维埃人民的先锋队的苏维埃工人阶级，在社会主义的建设的年月中，已经走过了一段漫长的进步道路。在苏联，充分发展个人能力和能够过一个丰满生活的条件，已经创造了，巨大的变化产生在对劳动的社会的态度上。无论那一个人在那一个部门工作，这一种对劳动的社会的态度已经成为个人的创造力的满足的源泉。每一个人按照他的喜爱来挑选他的职业，主要的动力是他的愿望——怎样去进一步改善他的技能和熟练程度，怎样去加速建设的步伐。
    在社会主义的劳动的过程中，人的视野是扩大了，因为新的品质已经在他身上形成。莫洛托夫在他的一篇演说中说道：“今天苏维埃人民的精神的特点首先表现在对他们工作的自觉的态度上，他们觉得他们的工作是具有重要的社会意义的……”
    苏维埃工人的教育一年又一年地达到更高的水平。教育的形式是多种多样的。有各种学校可以让工人在他工作的余暇去学习，如技术学校，夜校，函授学校等等。人人能够获得继续不断的进步和发展的机会。今天的机器匠能够成为明天的工头，甚至工程师。在苏维埃的工业中，这已经是极普通的事情了。
    三十年来苏维埃工人的发展的道路，明显地表现在文学当中。
    自从Ｆ·革拉特可夫的小说《士敏士》问世以来，差不多已经有四分之一世纪。但它所描写的人物依旧非常新鲜动人。它的主要人物格莱勃·楚曼洛夫的重要作用，在历史的配景前更是显得清楚。
    他是一个经历了革命和内战的锻炼的工人，当他回到他的工厂去时，他带来了新的意识。他不再觉得他是受剥削的卑微人物，而是生产的主人翁，他觉得必须尽速恢复生产。工厂被毁了一半。楚曼洛夫看到工厂的景象不由得不心痛，场地上一片乱草，无人的厂屋里歪倒着生锈的机器，四周弥漫着一片死亡荒凉的气息。
    这个死了的工厂的悲惨景象，激动了格莱勃。他被不可抑制的立刻去开始工作的愿望所抓住，他要使工厂立刻为新社会服务。他深深地痛苦着，愤怒着，因为同志们没有能够好好儿保护这个厂。
    楚曼洛夫遇到原则问题的出入时，决不含糊放松，他的卓越的性格吸引住读者。他是不识得犹豫的。共产主义的思想鼓舞着他。他不是那种会裁倒，会被障碍所阻止的人，因为他对工人阶级的创造能力具有无限的信心。他接受布尔什维克党的政策好像是他自己的有机的一部分一样，它已经成为他个人的事情，他以他的全副心肠去推行它。
    革拉特可夫在这一性格的描写上，他给我们看到好几面。在家庭生活方面，楚曼洛夫不是尽善尽美的。他没有立刻使自己适应他妻子戴莎的解放。当他最后了解她，同样也是为了那伟大的目标，他所最关心的利益而工作时，他才克服了他对他妻子的妒忌和统制她的心理，重新赢得了她的爱情。
    革拉特可夫卓越地描绘了工人阶级的团结的图画，他表现了工人们对一个以他的力量和意志去帮助他们建立幸福生活的一个同志的敬重和爱慕。
    《士敏士》刻划了建设的开端，破坏了的土地的怎样复活。革拉特可夫的次一小说《能》，便是描绘这伟大的新建设的进行的。
    苏维埃人民学会了新的高度的技术，整个国家卷入建设的热潮中。
    小说《能》是描写那有名的德聂泊河上的水力发电站的建造的。小说给我们看见了一幅广大的图画，四万集体的工人参加这伟大的工程。作者写出各种不同的生动的性格。并不是所有的人都具有同样心思的，并不是所有的人都用同样的眼睛来看世界的。但他们绝大多数是有同一个热情——那就是：前进，克服路上的一切阻碍，保证社会主义的迅速胜利。
    昨天的工人是怎样努力整理废墟，恢复生产，今天我们看见他从事于新的建设，在这个过程中他获得了新的品质。他生长着，发展着。他充分了解并且赞助一切复杂的斗争，为了我们国家的社会主义的建设。布尔什维克工人的性格，建设事业的成功的依赖者——广大群众的组织者的性格，在这一斗争中更深刻地表现出来。
    《能》的主人公党委书记瓦塔金是和格莱勃·楚曼洛夫同一代的人物，但在好几方面他超越了楚曼洛夫。
    主人公的性格在小说《能》中关于他的实际行动的描写中，强有力地表现出来。这些行动组成了他的整个生活的意义。他清楚地理解人们怎样才能使自己幸福，并且他愿意尽快地去赢得这个幸福。
    作者以极大的说服力去显示出这新型的人对国家的目标和生产工作有着最大的关心。
    不单是那主角，而是所有的巨大工程的从事者都一致奋勇向前。作者刻划了人民的创造力的发展。这一点有力地表现在描写工人会议讨论生产计划的几个场面上。工程师中间的破坏分子发狂地反对工人的计划。他们所发出的站在技术立场上的反对意见看起来几乎是无法回答的。但是工人们粉碎了他们的阻挠。他们用自己的，根据了突击工作经验所产生的计算方法，去反对反动意识的工程师们的技术计算方法。
    在那生动地描绘着的水泥工人卡蒂娃·巴契柯瓦身上，作者表现了苏维埃女工人的富于创造力的性格。同时在她的性格中，作者也显示了苏维埃人民的特有的新的心理状态。
    卡蒂娃并不只是机械地按时上班下班，她并不认为工作只是为了生活。她把她的工作视为公共的事业，而与她有着密切的私人的关系。因为这工程既是她的，也是人民的！每一个苏维埃人看到了缺点的时候，不得不指出来，如果有什么意见也尽量发表！就是这个特点，形成了苏维埃制度，苏维埃民主的力量和它的不可摧毁性。作者在他的小说的角色身上，表现出这一种力量来。
    革拉特可夫的两本小说描写了苏维埃工人阶级和布尔什维克党在创立一个新的生活的过程中的故事。作为群众的组织者和思想领导者的党的作用，在这里是以活生生的动作来表现的。
    二十年代和三十年代的初期是资本主义世界经历着严重的经济恐慌的时期，而苏联却向前发展，在全国各地建立了越来越新的工厂，形成了历史上著名的社会主义的竞赛。这事实自然而然地成为许多苏维埃作家的主要作品的题材。莱奥诺夫的“索特”，和卡泰耶夫的“时间，前进呀！”就刻划了这伟大的竞赛的初期。
    工人阶级，社会主义的建立者的英勇努力在Ｖ·伊尔扬可夫的《联动机轴》和《阳光的城市》，和克里莫夫的《油船德宾特号》，《工程师》和别的一些天才的作品中成功地描绘着。
    我们看见工人阶级走上了创造性的活动的康庄大道。
    在这些年代中，新的工人阶级的生力军成长起来了。由工人阶级的最优秀的传统的精神所教育起来的青年，带来了新的动力，对劳动的渴望，和伟大的创造性。所有这些品质被应用到新的城市，新的工厂，机器和曳引机站，和国营农场的建设上。
    一个辉煌的例子就是亚穆河上有名的共产主义青年城的建立。一个城市矗立在原先是荒无人迹的广大的苔原上，它完全是由苏维埃青年的手建造的。在一个比较短匆的时期内，在原始森林地带的困难条件下，去执行这个任务是需要极大的勇气，热情和意志的。Ｖ·克特梁斯卡娃的小说的主题就是这个，书名合适地题着“勇敢”这个字。
    这本小说用巨大的画幅表现出四百个共产主义青年团员，这些苏维埃青年的花朵，怎样从全国各地来到苔原上，在一条泛滥无定的河岸上参加建城的工作。
    青年们不单是带着青春的活力来工作，而且具有社会主义的最高的道德和对这一个工作的深挚的爱情。
    小说向读者展开一连串的激动的场景。我们看见在党的书记莫洛佐夫的办公室里的工作会议。现在这个城市只是存在于地图上，只是一个红色的点子。这个点子吸引着所有的青年建设者们的视线。他们倾听着他们的年长的同志所说的每一个字。莫洛佐夫说：
    “这里一无所有……你们！”他加重语气说，“你们将在这里建造一个城市，建造许多工厂和新的生活……开始的时候，条件将是困难的。但是这一区域是好的。如果我们去发展它，它就会成为一个富饶和美丽的地方……你们必须了解这个。你们必须学会去爱它。……”
    他直率地向他们这样说，一点也不隐瞒。让他们知道他们的处境如何。对于任何一样东西，从开始到结束，都必须用他们自己的手去作。为了他们自己，也为了将来的人们。
    青年们就这样实现这个理想。他们在亚穆河边扎营，开始建造一个新的城市和工厂。
    青年建设家的精神状态，很充分地表现在小说的女主角克拉瓦的语言中。“一个人要是不梦想着将来，不看到任何目标，不企图把他的国家造成一个快乐的社会主义的国家，便是一个窄狭的渺小的人。”
    苏联的工人阶级有信心地大步前进，在全国建造新的城市和工厂。在新的发展阶段中的工人的性格，现在表现在革拉特可夫的新的小说《誓言》中，这是他在爱国战争的时期所写的。作者显示出苏维埃男人和女人怎样达成他们的伟大的誓言，去打败敌人。
    这本书的主人公们就是“士敏士”中的领袖人物的儿子和孙子们。他们是在新的条件下成长的。他们按照最新的技术建设巨型工厂。他们受到社会主义社会的教育，他们稳步的提高着工作的水准，他们代表了一种新型的工人。
    小说的中心人物是旋盘工沙洛诺夫。作者在这个人物上结晶了现代苏维埃工人的最典型的特点，他的工作的兴趣是浓厚的，他是深深地爱着他的国家的。沙洛诺夫是一个最广大意义上的文化人。他不单是他的业务的完善的老手，而且政治水平很高，更非常熟悉文学。苏维埃制度创造了发展个人才能的必要条件。沙洛诺夫不仅是一个熟练的工人，而且是一个有才能的发明家。
    苏维埃人民的团结力量在这本书中明显地表现出来。沙洛诺夫所工作的工厂从列宁格勒迁移到乌拉尔去，那儿是苏联的最老的工业中心。乌拉尔人民给他们的列宁格勒同志以兄弟般的欢迎，尽一切力量帮助他们获得工作的最好的条件。
    革拉特可夫用沙洛诺夫所写的日记方式来写“誓言”。这使主人公的发言具有更大的说服力，这些语言透露了苏维埃人的德性的深度，他的英雄气概的灵魂，显示出在他身上，私人的和公共的利益结合成一个和谐的整体。
    革拉特可夫的小说的主人公是现实生活中的一个典型性格。像沙洛诺夫这样的人，在苏维埃国家内正在不断地生长。在最近的文学作品中也有反映出来。在巴巴夫的小说《钢与矿渣》和阿扎耶夫的《远离莫斯科的地方》中的角色身上，也同样表现了这些特色。这两个作品表现了前进中的苏维埃工人的典型。阿扎耶夫的主人公的显著的特性是坚毅刚强，和克服一切艰难困苦的能力。
    为了建造一条油管而集合在一起的工人们，以及他们之中的领袖人物巴特曼诺夫和勃列德兹，他们的力量是从什么东西产生的呢？是由于他们的团结一致，目标统一，纪律严明和他们的高度的社会主义的意识。人人都知道国家的利益就是他自己的利益。
    这个建设工作没有电话做必要的交通工具。工程师塔尼亚·伐西尔钦柯向共产主义青年团求助，立刻她就得到一队自动要求敷设电线的青年，他们在短短的六个星期之内完成了这个任务，装置一道电线横越草原，通到最远的工作站去。
    其次是没有路。曳引机驾驶员西林和卡车驾驶员斯莫契可夫担任了在深厚的积雪中打开一条路的工作。他们艰苦地通过了好几百英里的路程。除了他们本人之外，再也不能找到旁人来帮助他们向暴风雪作战。而结果他们是胜利地完成了。
    所有这一切，以及别的事业只有在社会主义国家内才可能成功，这些小说的主人公是被国家的利益所推动所鼓舞的。当西林和斯莫契可夫开始去开辟一条道路的时候，他们所想的不是他们将在这次困难的路程中赚到什么，或者，不这样就要受到怎样的损失。他们所关切着的，只是他们知道这条油管的建造对于国家是非常重要的，他们渴望也能在加速完成这个建设任务中分担一份工作。
    阿扎耶夫的主人公是完全没有旧的私有社会的人们的心理状态的。他们看世界，看他们自己的工作，首先从公共的观点去看。就在这个基础上，形成了社会主义社会中的人的心理状态。
    工人阶级是新的物质价值的创造者，也是新社会的建立者。这些小说让我们看见了工人在他的机器旁边，在他的家庭中，在他的社会义务中，在战争中的面貌。
    广大的视野，勇敢的创造力，飞跃的想像力，结合着清醒的工作效率，忍耐，对劳动同志的温暖的友谊的关心——这些就是用艺术的形象表现在苏维埃文学中的苏维埃工人的特性。（《苏联文学》十月号）
