　　The reactionary and influential U.S. publication, "U.S. News & World Report," ran with this headline: "Germany's Difficulty: Too Many People." The magazine's text proves that the root cause of West Germany's difficulties is very simple: "Eight million too many people."

　　The starting point of the American reactionaries is not new. The French imperialist "Tiger Premier" Clemenceau should be the first to file a complaint against them for so shamelessly plagiarizing his words. It was he, as everyone should remember, who created this infamous golden rule, saying that twenty million Germans were really too many for the world.

　　Hitler adopted the slander spread by such hate-mongers, adapted it to his own purposes, and used it to numb the minds of millions. Now it is the American warmongers who are launching a despicable "too many people" story in Germany.

　　In response to the reactionaries of the time who said that there was eternal happiness after becoming a monk, and who sang the "ancient song of becoming a monk," the great German poet Heine wrote:

　　"We are willing to be happy in this world,
　　Not to go hungry because there are strong ones.
　　Empty stomachs no longer rely on
　　The fruits of hard labor to be filled,
　　Bread grows on the ground for everyone,
　　Enough and even too much."

　　The rich in America can find an overabundance of people everywhere, in Germany, in China, in England, and even in their own country. But their frantic clamor about overpopulation leads to two different ideas; the overpopulation on earth is not the hard-working masses who produce daily necessities. In fact, the unnecessary surplus of people are precisely those parasites and bloodsuckers who support and defend a decadent and bankrupt system that cannot give the people of all countries bread, peace, and freedom.

    旧调重弹
    美国的反动和有势力的《美国新闻和世界报导》，有着这样一个标题：“德国的困难，人口太多”。这杂志在行文上证明了西德困难的根源，是非常简单的一个：“八百万人口太多了。”
    美国反动派出发点，并不是新奇的。这样无耻地剽窃别人的句子，首先该由法帝国主义“老虎总理”克里孟梭来向他们提控诉。这是他，大家该还记得，创造了这不名誉的金科玉律，说什么两千万德国人口在世界上实在是太多了。
    希特勒采取了这样憎恨贩子所播的谰言，把它适应到自己方面去，利用它麻醉了成百万人的心理。现在该是美国战争贩子在德国发动一个“人民太多”的卑劣故事了。
    为了答复当时反动派，说什么出家后有着永恒的幸福，从而高唱着“出家的古歌”，德国大诗人海涅曾写道：
    “我们甘愿快乐地在这世上，
    不因有强者而饥饿。
    空空如也的胃不再靠着
    苦工的果实来吃饱，
    面包为着人人生长在地上，
    够了而且还嫌太多。”
    美国的富人们到处可以找出人口的过剩来，在德国，在中国，在英国，甚至在美国自己的国里。可是他们疯狂般关于人口过剩的叫嚣，却引出两个不同的观念来；大地上过剩的人口，并不是那班生产日常生活用品的辛苦大众。事实上不需要的过剩人民，正是那些拥护保卫不能给各国人民面包、和平及自由的腐朽破产制度的寄生者和吸血者。
