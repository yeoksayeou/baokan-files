    The origin of the so-called "barracks" in the "embassy district" of Dongjiaomin Lane, Beijing, dates back to 1900. At that time, the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded Beijing and forced the Qing Dynasty to sign an unequal treaty, putting forward many unreasonable demands. One of them was that the embassies of various countries had been besieged by the so-called "Boxer rebels" and had no security. Taking this as an excuse, the imperialist countries demanded to station troops to protect the embassies, demarcate the embassy area, and defend it by themselves. The incompetent Qing government, on September 7, 1901, had Yikuang and Li Hongzhang, representing China, sign the humiliating Treaty of Xinchou with the envoys of eleven countries, including Britain, the United States, Japan, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Spain, Russia, France, Italy, and the Netherlands. Article 7 stipulated: "The State of the Qing Dynasty agrees that the embassy boundaries shall be exclusively for residence and use, and shall be managed exclusively by the embassies of various countries. Chinese people are not allowed to live within the boundaries. They may also defend themselves." Annex 14, "Explanation of the Embassy Boundary Map," marked the boundaries on all four sides, allocating more than 1,000 mu of land near Dongjiaomin Lane to various countries. Since then, various countries have built large-scale defense works, building high and thick walls on the east, west, and north sides (the south side being the city wall). The walls were densely packed with gun holes, and gun emplacements were built inside, aimed at the surrounding Chinese houses. Each traffic thoroughfare was equipped with iron gates. Outside the walls, dozens of zhang of open space were left, on the one hand, for training the guards and, on the other hand, to facilitate "defense." Within the boundaries, they also set up their own "police stations," while military power belonged to the commanders of the stationed troops of the imperialist countries. Chinese armed soldiers and police were absolutely not allowed to enter the area, which resembled a country. This was a serious violation of China's territorial sovereignty by unequal treaties and a huge insult to the Chinese people!

    Within the "embassy area," after the Gengzi Year (1900), countries that separately established barracks included the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Japan, and Russia. In 1928, the reactionary Kuomintang government established its capital in Nanjing, and the embassies of various countries moved south accordingly, and consulates were established in Beijing. Although Dongjiaomin Lane was no longer the area of ​​the embassies, the countries refused to give up the rights they had plundered and continued to station troops and administer the area. At that time, the only country that voluntarily abandoned the right to station troops in Dongjiaomin Lane was the Soviet Union. After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union was the first to announce the abolition of all unequal treaties signed between Tsarist Russia and our country and abandoned all the privileges Tsarist Russia had plundered in our country. Since then, it had not participated in the administrative affairs of the embassy area, and the Tsarist Russian barracks were announced to be abolished and converted into civilian housing. The American barracks were located at the end of the west entrance of Dongjiaomin Lane, south of the road. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese army sealed it off and occupied it. After Japan surrendered, the United States continued to occupy the barracks and used it as a camp for the U.S. military stationed in Beijing. Although it had been empty since the withdrawal of the U.S. military, it refused to return it to China, using the excuse of establishing a Chinese language school for U.S. Army officers. The Italian and Japanese barracks were near the Yuhe Bridge and have been recovered. The German barracks were located at the east end of Dongjiaomin Lane. A part was given to the Netherlands after World War I, known as the east courtyard of the Dutch Embassy, and the other part was converted into a German primary school, both of which have been recovered by our country. The entire north side of Taijichang Third Lane was the French barracks, which the French consulate continued to use until this recovery.

    After the liberation of Beijing, the People's Liberation Army fully armed passed through the streets of Dongjiaomin Lane. This was the first time in fifty years that Chinese troops had set foot on this territory that entirely belonged to their own country. Now the Military Control Commission has announced the recovery of the real estate of the barracks of the United States, France, and the Netherlands, and requisitioned the houses on their land, which truly abolished the remnants of the imperialist "right to station troops" in China, making the territorial sovereignty of Dongjiaomin Lane, which had been lost for a full fifty years, truly return to the embrace of the motherland.

    北京东交民巷的外国兵营
    北京东交民巷所谓“使馆区”中的“兵营”之由来，始自一九○○年。当时八国联军侵入北京，逼迫满清订立城下之盟，提出许多无理要求，其中一项认为各国使馆曾遭所谓“拳匪”围攻，没有安全保障。各帝国主义国家以此为借口，要求驻兵保卫使馆，划定使馆界区域，由各国自行防守，无能的满清政府，乃于一九○一年九月七日，由奕劻与李鸿章代表与英、美、日、德、奥、比、西、俄、法、意、荷十一国公使签订了丧权辱国的辛丑和约，其中第七条规定：“大清国国家允定各使馆境界以为专与住用之处，并独由各使馆管理。中国民人不准在界内居住。亦可自行防守。”并在附件十四“使管界图说”中标明四至界线，把东交民巷附近广袤一千余亩的土地划给各国。自是以后，各国乃大修防御工事，在东、西、北三面（南面是城墙）筑起高厚的围墙，围墙上枪眼密集，墙内筑有炮台，对准着四周的中国民房，各交通衢闸设有铁栅，围墙之外各留空地数十丈，一方面用以操练守兵，一方面利于“防守”。在界内并且自行设置“警察署”，军事权力则属于各帝国主义国家驻屯军的司令官。中国武装军人及警察绝对不许入界，俨然像一个国家。这是不平等条约给中国领土主权严重的侵犯，也是对中国人民巨大的侮辱！
    “使馆界”内在庚子（一九○○年）以后单独设有兵营的，有美、法、德、英、意、日、俄等七国。一九二八年，国民党反动政府定都南京，各国使馆也随着南迁，在北京改设领事馆。虽然东交民巷已不复是公使馆的区域，但各国不肯放弃已掠夺到的权利，依旧驻兵管辖。那时唯一自动放弃在东交民巷驻兵权的，只有苏联一国。苏联在十月革命以后，首先宣布废除帝俄与我国所订一切不平等条约，放弃帝俄在我国所掠夺的各种特权，从此即未参加使馆界的行政事务，帝俄兵营亦即宣布废止，改为民房。美国兵营在东交民巷西口路南的尽头，太平洋战争爆发后，日军曾查封占用。日本投降后，美国继续霸占兵营，作为驻北京美军的营房。美军撤退后虽然一直空着，但又借口要改设美国陆军军官华语学校，而拒绝交还中国。意国兵营与日本兵营则在御河桥附近，已先后收回主权。德国兵营在东交民巷的东头，一部于第一次世界大战后让与荷兰，即所谓荷兰使馆东院，另一部改设了一个德国小学，均已由我国收回。台基厂三条路北，全部是法国兵营，直至这次收回以前仍由法领事馆继续使用。
    北京解放后，人民解放军曾全副武装通过东交民巷的街道，这是五十年来中国军队第一次踏入这块完全属于自己国家的领土。现在军管会宣布收回美、法、荷三国的兵营的地产，并征用其地上的房屋，才真正废除了帝国主义在中国“驻兵权”的遗迹，使丧失了整整五十年的东交民巷的这些领土主权，才真正回到了祖国的怀抱。
