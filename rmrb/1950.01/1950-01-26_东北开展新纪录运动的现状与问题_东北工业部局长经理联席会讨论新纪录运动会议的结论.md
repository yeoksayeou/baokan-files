    The Current Situation and Problems of the New Record Movement in Northeast China
    —Conclusions of the Meeting of the Northeast Industrial Department Bureau Director and Manager Joint Conference on Discussing the New Record Movement
            I. The Current Situation and Steps of the New Record Movement
    In the past two months, the New Record Movement has achieved great results. However, the development of the movement is uneven. Not only is the development uneven across different regions, bureaus, and factories, but also within each factory (among departments, workshops, workers, apprentices, staff, technical personnel, and leading cadres). Some departments or workshops have seen a large number of valuable new records emerge, while others remain stagnant. One particularly noteworthy phenomenon is the continuous emergence of new records among workers, while production organization, material supply, and leadership structures lag behind, creating a mismatch and disconnection in the overall production process, hindering the continued advancement of the New Record Movement. This situation poses new questions for our leading cadres: how to change our labor organization, production organization, leadership structure, and various production systems based on the new situation to adapt to the new demands of the New Record Movement.
    The directive issued by the Industrial Department on November 18th last year was precisely based on this situation, especially the situation in factories with relatively widespread movement development. These factories are already facing these problems, and if these problems are not resolved, the New Record Movement will stall. For factories where the movement has not yet been widely launched, these problems may not have been encountered yet, but once the movement is widely launched, they will inevitably arise. Therefore, all factories should study and implement the directive carefully. However, in terms of steps, implementation should be based on the specific development of the New Record Movement in each factory, with priority given to urgent matters, and should not be rigidly executed. For example, in places where the movement has not yet been widely launched, the first step is still to mobilize the "initiative" of the masses and create momentum among the masses, because only with a mass base can the New Record Movement have life (in those factories where the New Record Movement is not yet sufficiently mobilized, the initial focus may still be on increasing labor intensity, improving quantity and quality, and then gradually expanding to all aspects). In places where the movement has already been widely launched, the problems raised in the directive should be resolved, namely, adjusting labor organization, production organization, establishing contact contracts, setting quotas, reorganizing leadership structures, and formulating labor discipline to adapt to the forward development of the movement.
            II. The New Record Movement Should Have Different Focuses in Different Bureaus and Factories
    The New Record Movement should be comprehensive, widespread, and diverse—from increasing labor intensity, improving quantity and quality to transforming tools, and creating inventions; from ordinary workers and apprentices to staff and leading cadres, everyone should create new records. However, each factory can and should have different focuses. This focus should be the key part and key problem of each factory. It may be a quality problem, or it may be how to create safe new records; another factory may focus on how to create new records for machine operation rates; and yet another factory's key problem may be labor intensity, tunneling methods, or recovery rates. For example, the most serious problem facing the Rubber Factory not long ago was the poor quality of its products. If the Rubber Factory does not first solve the quality problem, then despite creating many new records in other areas, it will still be selling poor-quality products that no one wants. Therefore, the key to judging the work of the Rubber Factory not long ago was its quality; as long as the quality of rubber products can be thoroughly resolved, the face of the Rubber Factory will be renewed, and the many new records of the Rubber Factory will be even more valuable due to the change in quality. This clearly shows that the focus of the Rubber Factory should be on concentrating efforts and consciously mobilizing employees to create new records for improving quality. Of course, they also need new records in other areas, but in any case, its focus should be on quality. Another example is the Electric Power Bureau, where the most important problem is frequent accidents in safe operation, which seriously threaten the power supply of the entire industrial system. If the safe operation problem of the Electric Power Bureau is not resolved, then despite having many new records in other areas, it still cannot solve the fundamental problem. Therefore, creating new records for safe operation and eliminating accidents has become the focus of the Electric Power Bureau's New Record Movement. After solving the main problem, its focus can naturally shift to solving another weakness. For example, not long ago, the quality of cement from the Cement Company had been resolved, so the focus of the Cement Company's New Record Movement should shift to other relatively weak areas, such as creating new records for increasing production. In short, pay more attention to the critical aspects of your own factory. Without a focus, without paying attention to the key problems of the factory, even if many new records are created, the basic problems of the factory still cannot be solved, and even the production tasks cannot be completed. This does not mean that we do not want thousands of new records in all aspects, but rather that each of our factories should pay special attention to mobilizing all employees to create new records in the key departments and key problems of the factory.
            III. Several Issues in the New Record Movement
    (1) The view of new records should first be based on the role they play in the overall production. To avoid simply pursuing temporary new records and producing shoddy goods, it should also be based on long-term value, that is, from the perspective of economic accounting, and should be measured by how much wealth it adds to the entire society. Simply put, it should be measured by its effectiveness in improving labor productivity under our entire economic plan.
    Therefore, to become a new record, there must be certain conditions and certain rules. Even if it exceeds the existing level, it cannot be considered a new record if it does not meet or violates certain rules or conditions. For example, if you produce products that are twice as high as the existing level in a certain amount of time, although it is a new record in terms of quantity, if these products do not meet quality specifications, violate "technical regulations," or damage the machine's lifespan, then even if the output is higher, it cannot be called a new record. Therefore, only breaking the existing level, existing technical quotas, and fully complying with quality specifications, without damaging the machine's lifespan and machine operation, is the new record that we require and promote.
    (2) New records are for completing and exceeding the overall production tasks of the enterprise. If a factory has many new records on the one hand, but the overall production tasks are not completed on the other hand, then the reasons must be carefully studied and quickly overcome. To avoid this phenomenon, in the future, the Industrial Department's rewards to various bureaus and factories will not only be based on the number of new records created by the factory, but also on its completion of overall production tasks. For factories that have created many new records but cannot complete production tasks, although the new records themselves will be rewarded, the leading cadres of that factory should be criticized. Because in this situation, it is clear that the leading cadres of the factory are blindly engaged in production, without paying attention to the new problems that have arisen in the New Record Movement, without organizing the new records, and without organizing and adjusting production. Therefore, the Industrial Department calls on the leading cadres of various bureaus and factories to launch competitions and strive to create new records for completing total production tasks.
    (3) New Records and Technical Regulations—Under normal circumstances, there should be technical regulations first, and then new records should be created on the basis of reasonable technical regulations, and reasonable technical regulations should not be violated in order to create new records. However, most of our factories do not yet have complete and scientific technical regulations, so we must gradually add reasonable and scientific technical regulations in the New Record Movement. Once the technical regulations are formulated, they should become the discipline that everyone must abide by in the factory's production, and become the factory's regulations, which must be absolutely observed and cannot be changed or violated casually. If it is believed in production that a certain technical regulation is unreasonable or needs to be revised, it must be changed only after being studied and approved by the factory. This is an important issue that must be paid attention to in the New Record Movement.
    (4) Special attention should be paid to establishing labor discipline and production discipline in the New Record Movement. The main content of labor discipline and production discipline should be to abide by the factory's technical regulations. In addition, some of our factories do not have production discipline, and irrelevant personnel come and go, like a city. This also shows that we have not strictly emphasized labor discipline and production discipline. Therefore, the administration, the Party, and the trade union should take some necessary measures to establish labor discipline and strengthen the education of labor discipline among employees (when necessary, it should be mandatory to make them abide by all labor discipline and production discipline), so that labor discipline becomes a discipline that employees consciously abide by. If we cannot do a good job in labor discipline and production discipline, then we cannot effectively launch and maintain new records.
    (5) Collective Contracts and Contact Contracts—There is a difference between collective contracts and contact contracts. A collective contract is a contract signed by the trade union and the factory administration to complete certain production tasks; a contact contract is a contract signed by workshops and departments in the factory to ensure mutual cooperation in the entire production, so that the entire production is not disconnected from each other, and to supervise and urge each other. In factories where we have not yet set reasonable quotas, collective contracts are best in short-term form, while contact contracts can be long-term, short-term, or in various temporary forms depending on the situation of each factory.
    (6) The Relationship between Rationalization Proposals and the New Record Movement—Rationalization proposals are an integral part of the New Record Movement. Rationalization proposals themselves can also create new records. Some rationalization proposals that cannot be done by individuals and require administrative solutions, if the output and quality are greatly improved due to adoption and implementation, then this rationalization proposal will also create extremely valuable new records. Therefore, there is no contradiction between rationalization proposals and the New Record Movement. The New Record Movement does not negate rationalization proposals or despise rationalization proposals. On the contrary, the New Record Movement is promoting and facilitating the implementation of rationalization proposals.
    (7) New records should be carried out around one or several major new records. New records cannot be created in isolation. If the main new records are not resolved, then other new records may reduce their significance. Only by focusing on the key departments and key problems of the factory and creating new records in these key departments and key problems can other new records have greater value. Therefore, new records should be led, rather than developing spontaneously. The leadership should always pay attention to avoid disconnecting various new records from key departments.
    (8) The Relationship between Collective Rewards and Individual Rewards—Collective rewards and individual rewards are unified. There are individual and collective new records. In many departments and workshops, we can advocate creating collective new records and collective rewards, especially in departments where the work connections between workers are particularly close, or where collective operations must be carried out. The creation of new records often requires the collective strength of employees, so the rewards often exceed the individual scope and require collective rewards. However, collective rewards must be built on the individual material basis, that is, different rewards should be given according to the role and value of each person in the new record. Whoever plays a major role, who contributes the most, should receive a larger share of the collective reward. On the contrary, if some people have not contributed anything to the new record, or are even harmful, they should not only not be rewarded, but also be criticized. Only by opposing the principle of equal distribution in collective rewards can we encourage everyone to work hard and give full play to everyone's enthusiasm.
            IV. The Current Key Issues
    The current New Record Movement poses new questions for leading cadres, namely, how the leading cadres, leading organs, organizational structure, and various systems can cooperate with the New Record Movement. That is: (1) How can the leading organs of various factories create more favorable conditions for the creation of new records and promote the further development of new records; (2) How to correct the shortcomings of the factory revealed in the New Record Movement in order to remove obstacles to the development of the New Record Movement; (3) How to create a "new record for the entire factory to complete and exceed the total production task". To this end, it is necessary to:
    (1) Organize meetings of advanced producers and new record creators to summarize and absorb experience, and organize advanced people to become the core of the factory.
    (2) In terms of the leadership structure, it should be changed according to the new situation. For example, the Planning Department (Section) and the Production Department (Section) should be separated immediately. The Planning Department should focus on planning, and the Production Department should pay attention to supply dispatch, production coordination, etc. in the production process to adapt to the new production requirements.
    (3) Change labor organization and production organization according to the requirements of new records. Changing production organization is not necessarily about reducing the number of people, but about how to be more reasonable and more adapted to the new production requirements. Therefore, how to better organize continuous production, and how each workshop can better schedule machinery and labor should be studied and changed. For example, in order to adapt to the production requirements after the New Record Movement, the Benxi Casting Plant changed from a one-shift system to a three-shift system with specific responsibilities, changed from opening a fire every three days to opening a fire every two days, and at the same time appropriately adjusted machinery and labor, so that the overall production increased by one-third.
    (4) Strengthen the work of the Management Committee and the Workers' Representative Conference (the Industrial Department has issued instructions in the past). The factory director must actively cooperate with the Party and the trade union in the factory, and provide them with favorable working conditions. It is necessary to make good use of the Management Committee and the Workers' Representative Conference to improve our factory management and promote the New Record Movement through the Management Committee and the Workers' Representative Conference.
            V. Quota Issues
    Quotas are a very complex issue in the factory. We cannot re-establish all quotas now, but in the New Record Movement, we should first establish several major quotas, and minor quotas can be gradually changed and revised based on the experience of the New Record Movement.
            VI. Resolutely Implement It
    The New Record Movement is an extremely huge event in our production and construction, and everyone must grasp this movement. In places where the movement has been widely launched, the recent instructions of the Industrial Department should be carefully studied and well implemented. In places where the movement has not yet been widely launched, the experience of others should be studied and quickly promoted. The New Record Movement is a long-term task. We must change from laymen to experts. First of all, we should seize this movement, go deep into the movement to find new problems, study problems, and summarize experience. From here, we can learn many valuable lessons. Whoever ignores this movement, whoever does not implement this movement in all workshops and all employees, then he will not only be unable to lead the production work of his factory well, but he will also not change from a layman to an expert.

    东北开展新纪录运动的现状与问题
    ——东北工业部局长经理联席会讨论新纪录运动会议的结论
            一、新纪录运动的现状与步骤
    二个多月来，新纪录运动有巨大成绩，但是运动的发展是不平衡的，不仅各地各局各厂矿发展不平衡，就是各厂矿本身（各部门各车间，工人、学徒与职员、技术人员、领导干部之间）的发展也是不平衡的，有的部门或车间涌现了大量的有价值的新纪录，另一个部门或车间则仍停留不前；更值得我们注意的一个现象就是在工人中新纪录不断出现，而生产组织，物资供应，领导机构方面则落在运动后面，因而造成整个生产过程不相适应与互相脱节的现象，障碍了新纪录运动继续前进。由于这种情况，就向我们领导干部提出了新的问题——就是如何根据新的情况改变我们的劳动组织、生产组织、领导机构以及各种生产制度，以适应新纪录运动新的要求。
    工业部在去年十一月十八日发出的指示，正是根据这一情况出发的，特别是根据运动发展比较广泛的厂矿而发的，因为这些厂矿目前已经碰到这些问题，如果不解决这些问题，新纪录运动就会停留不前。对于运动尚未广泛展开的厂矿来说，目前虽然尚未碰到这些问题，但一旦运动广泛展开，也将一定碰到。因之各厂矿都应很好研究执行。但在步骤上应根据新纪录运动在每个厂矿发展的具体情况，分别先后缓急，不能呆板执行。譬如在运动尚未广泛发动的地方，首先仍是发动群众的“首创”精神，在群众中造成运动，因为只有有了群众基础，新纪录运动才能有生命（在这些新纪录运动发动尚不充分的厂矿，开始时也许主要的仍是提高劳动强度，提高数量质量，然后逐渐发展到各方面）。在运动展开已经比较广泛的地方，则应该解决指示中所提出的问题，就是调整劳动组织、生产组织、订立联系合同、制定定额、改组领导机构、制订劳动纪律等，以适应运动向前发展。
            二、新纪录运动在各局各厂矿应有不同的重心
    新纪录运动应该是全面的、广泛的、多种多样的——从提高劳动强度，提高数量质量到改造工具，创造发明；从普通工人学徒，到职员、领导干部都应该创造新纪录，但是各厂矿可以有而且应该有不同的重心。这种重心应该是各厂矿的关键部分与关键问题，它可能是质量问题，也可能是如何创造安全新纪录问题，另一个厂矿可能又是如何创造机器运转率新纪录问题；再一个厂矿的关键问题又可能是劳动强度、掘进方法、或回收率问题。例如，不久之前摆在橡胶厂面前最严重的问题，是它的产品质量不好，假如橡胶厂不首先解决质量问题，那么橡胶厂尽管在其他方面创造了许许多多的新纪录，它拿到市场的仍然会是质量不好，大家不愿意要的商品。因此，在不久之前决定橡胶厂工作好坏的关键是它的质量；只要能够把橡胶产品的质量彻底解决，橡胶厂的面貌就会为之一新，而且橡胶厂的许许多多新纪录，也会由于质量改变而更增加其价值。这显然说明橡胶厂的重心，应该是首先集中力量，有意识的发动员工创造提高质量的新纪录。当然他们也需其他方面的新纪录，但无论如何，它的重心应放在质量上。再如电业局目前最主要的问题，是在安全运转问题上经常发生事故，严重的威胁着全部工业系统的电力，假如电业局的安全运转问题不解决，那么电业局尽管有其他方面许许多多的新纪录，也还是不能解决根本问题，因此创造安全运转消灭事故的新纪录，就成为电业局创造新纪录的重心。在解决了主要问题之后，自然它的重心又可转到解决另一个弱点上面去。如不久之前水泥公司水泥的质量已经解决，那么水泥公司创造新纪录的重心就应该转到其他比较薄弱的方面，例如创造增加产品的新纪录。总之要多注意自己厂矿生死攸关的地方，生死攸关的问题。没有重心，不注意本厂矿的关键问题，即使创造了很多新纪录，仍然不能解决本厂矿的基本问题，甚至不能完成生产任务。但这并不是说，我们不要各方面的千百件的新纪录，而只是说我们各个厂矿应该特别注意发动所有员工，在本厂矿的关键部门的关键问题上创造新纪录。
            三、新纪录运动中的几个问题
    （一）对新纪录的看法首先应该从它在整个生产中所起的作用来看，为了避免只图一时的新纪录而粗制滥造起见，还要从长期的价值来看，就是说要从经济核算的意义上来看，要以它对整个社会增加多少财富上来衡量其价值，简单地说，也就是在我们的整个经济计划之下它对提高劳动生产率的效能上来衡量其价值。
    因此，要成为新纪录，就必须要有一定的条件、一定的规章，不合乎或破坏了一定的规章、一定的条件，即使它是超过了现有的水平，也不能算是新纪录；例如你在一定的工时之内，做出了比现有水平高出一倍两倍数量的产品，在数量上看虽然是创造了新纪录，但假如这些产品不合乎质量规格，破坏了“技术规程”，或者因此损害了机器寿命，那么即使产量再高也不能叫做新纪录。因此，只有打破现有水平、现有技术定额，而又完全合乎质量规格，无损于机器寿命，机器运转的，才是我们所要求所提倡的新纪录。
    （二）新纪录是为了完成与超过本企业单位总的生产任务的，如果某一个厂矿一方面有了很多新纪录，而另一方面总的生产任务却未完成，那么就必须很好研究其中原因，并迅速加以克服。为了避免这种现象，今后工业部对各局、各厂矿的奖励，将不仅仅从那一个厂矿创造新纪录的多少来看，而且要从它完成总的生产任务上来看，对于创造了许多新纪录而又不能完成生产任务的厂矿，虽然对于新纪录本身要加以奖励，但那个厂矿的领导干部则应受到批评。因为在这种情况之下，显然的该厂矿的领导干部是在盲目的进行生产。而没有注意创造新纪录运动中所发生的新问题，没有对于新纪录加以组织，也没有对生产加以组织与调整。因此工业部号召各局、各厂矿的领导干部展开竞赛，为创造完成生产总任务的新纪录而奋斗。
    （三）新纪录与技术规程——在正常情况下本来应该是先有技术规程，在合理的技术规程的基础上来创造新纪录，而且不能因创造新纪录而破坏合理的技术规程。但是现在我们多数厂矿，尚没有完备的科学的技术规程，因此我们就要在新纪录运动中逐渐增定合理的科学的技术规程。技术规程一经制定之后，即应成为这一厂矿生产上大家必须遵守的纪律，成为厂矿的法规，所有的人必须绝对遵守，不能随便改变与破坏。如果在生产中认为某一技术规程不合理，或尚有改正之必要时，也一定要得到厂矿研究批准后才能改变，这是在新纪录运动中所必须注意的重要问题。
    （四）在新纪录运动中特别要注意建立劳动纪律、生产纪律。劳动纪律、生产纪律主要的内容应该是遵守工厂的技术规程。此外我们有些工厂没有生产上的纪律，闲杂人员来来往往，简直像个城市，这也说明我们对于劳动纪律、生产纪律没有严格地加以重视。因之行政、党、工会应在建立劳动纪律这一工作上进行一些必要的措施，在职工中加强劳动纪律的教育（在必要时应该是强制的使他遵守一切劳动纪律与生产纪律），使劳动纪律成为职工自觉的遵守的纪律。如果我们不能把劳动纪律与生产纪律搞好，那就不能很好开展与保持新纪录。
    （五）集体合同与联系合同——集体合同与联系合同是有区别的。集体合同是工会与厂方行政为完成一定生产任务所订立的合同；联系合同则是工厂中车间与车间，或这部门与另一部门为互相保证配合整个生产，使整个生产不致互相脱节，并为了相互监察督促而订立的。在目前我们尚未定出合理定额的厂矿，集体合同最好是短期的形式，而联系合同则可根据各厂矿情况订立长期的、短期的或以临时各种各样的形式进行。
    （六）合理化建议与新纪录运动的关系——合理化建议是新纪录运动的一个组成部分。合理化建议本身也可能造成新纪录。有些非个人能力所能办到而要行政加以解决的合理化建议，如果由于采纳实行，而使产量质量得以大大提高，那么这个合理化建议也就创造了极有价值的新纪录，所以合理化建议与新纪录运动没有矛盾。新纪录运动不是否定合理化建议，或轻视合理化建议，恰恰相反，新纪录运动正是发扬与促进合理化建议的实施的。
    （七）新纪录应围绕一个或几个主要新纪录去进行，新纪录不能孤立的去创造。如果主要的新纪录没有解决，那么其他的新纪录也许会减少其意义，只有围绕着这一厂矿的关键部门关键问题，并在这个关键部门关键问题上创造了新纪录之后，其他的新纪录才能有其更大的价值。因之新纪录应该是有领导的，而不是自流的任其自然发展，领导上应该时刻注意不要使各种新纪录与关键部门脱节。
    （八）集体奖励与个人奖励的关系——集体奖励与个人奖励是统一的。新纪录有个人的，也有集体的。在许多部门与车间，我们可以提倡创造集体的新纪录与集体奖励，特别是在各个工人之间的工作联系特别密切，或必须进行集体操作的部门，新纪录的创造常常是需要职工集体力量，因而奖励也就常常超过了个人范围，而需要给以集体奖励。但集体奖励必须建筑在个人物质基础上，这就是应按每个人在新纪录中所起的作用、价值大小，进行不同的奖励，谁起的作用大，谁出的力最多，谁就应该得到集体奖励中更多的一部分。反之，如果其中有些人，对新纪录没有什么贡献，甚至有害，则不但不能得奖，而且要进行批评。只有反对了集体奖励中的平均分配原则，才能鼓励大家努力，也才能发挥每个人的积极性。
            四、目前的关键问题
    目前新纪录运动向领导干部提出了新的问题，就是领导干部、领导机关、组织机构与各种制度如何配合新纪录运动的问题。也就是：（１）各个厂矿的领导机关如何给新纪录创造更顺利的条件，促进新纪录更向前发展；（２）如何改正新纪录运动中所暴露出的本厂矿的缺点，以便去掉新纪录运动发展的障碍；（３）如何创造整个厂矿的“完成与超过总生产任务的新纪录”。为此就必须：
    （一）组织先进生产者新纪录创造者的会议，总结与吸收经验，并把先进者组织起来成为工厂的核心。
    （二）在领导机构方面，应根据新的情况加以改变。例如计划处（科）、生产处（科）应即分开，计划处专门搞计划，生产处注意生产过程中的供应调度、生产配合等，以适应新的生产要求。
    （三）根据新纪录的要求改变劳动组织、生产组织。改变生产组织并不是一定在于减少人数，而是怎样更合理，更适应于新的生产要求。因之，对于如何更好地组织连续生产，各车间如何更好去调度机械与劳动等，应加以研究与改变。例如本溪铸造场为了适应新纪录运动后的生产要求，由一班制改为三班专责制，每三天开一火，改为二天开一火，同时机械与劳动加以适当的调整，使整个生产提高三分之一。
    （四）加强管委会与职工代表会议的工作（过去工业部曾有指示），工厂厂长要积极的与工厂中的党、工会配合，给他们以有利的工作条件，必须很好运用管委会与职工代表会，以改进我们的工厂管理，通过管委会与职工代表会把新纪录运动推广起来。
            五、定额问题
    定额在工厂中是很复杂的问题，现在我们还不能重新制定所有的定额，但在新纪录运动中，我们应该首先把几个主要的定额制定出来，次要的定额可以根据新纪录的经验逐渐加以改变与重新订正。
            六、坚决贯彻下去
    新纪录运动是我们生产建设上极其巨大的一件事，大家必须抓紧这一运动。在运动已经广泛展开的地方，应仔细的研究工业部最近的指示，并很好的贯彻下去，在运动尚未广泛开展的地方，应研究人家的经验迅速推动起来。新纪录运动是一个长期的工作，我们要从外行变为内行，首先就应该抓住这一运动，深入运动中发现新问题，研究问题，总结经验，从这里我们可以学习到许多宝贵的学问，谁要忽视这一运动，谁要不把这一运动贯彻到所有的车间、所有的职工中去，那么他不仅不能把自己厂矿的生产工作领导好，而且他也不会从外行变为内行。
