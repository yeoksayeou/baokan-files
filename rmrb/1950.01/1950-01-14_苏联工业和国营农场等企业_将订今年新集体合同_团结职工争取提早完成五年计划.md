Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 13th: TASS, Moscow - The Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions discussed the results of the implementation of collective contracts last year and the issue of signing new contracts for 1950 on the 9th. Council Secretary Osipov pointed out in his report that the collective contracts stipulated the mutual obligations between management and employees. The implementation of collective contracts has contributed to the great achievements of Soviet industry and other sectors of the national economy, as well as the improvement of the people's living standards last year. When mentioning that the management departments of various enterprises and trade union organizations have fulfilled their obligations, Osipov emphasized the progress made by the management departments in housing construction and cultural construction for employees. For example, the housing area obtained by Soviet miners in 1949 exceeded the state plan by 100,000 square meters. Various facilities for labor protection and safety, such as the installation of ventilators, safety equipment, and baffles, have been implemented. Last year, trade union organizations sent 315,000 more children of workers and staff to summer camps than in 1948. More than 500 new clubs were built last year, and 2,100 new libraries and 1,000 trade union clubs and cinemas were opened.

The Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions decided to sign new collective contracts for 1950 in factories and workshops, railways and construction sites, state farms, machine and tractor stations, and other enterprises in January and February. This will be a mass economic and political movement to unite Soviet workers and staff to strive for the early completion of the Five-Year Plan.

    苏联工业和国营农场等企业
    将订今年新集体合同
    团结职工争取提早完成五年计划
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：全苏工会中央理事会主席团，在九日讨论了去年执行集体合同的结果及订立一九五零年新合同的问题。理事会书记奥希波夫在报告中指出：集体合同中规定了经理部门与员工间相互的义务，集体合同的执行，已有助于苏联工业和国民经济其他部门的伟大成就，以及去年人民生活水平的提高。奥希波夫提及各企业经理部门及工会组织已履行他们所承担的义务时，着重指出经理部门在为职工们所进行的房屋修建及文化建设方面的进步。例如苏联矿工在一九四九年所得到的住房面积，就比国家计划超过了十万平方公尺。为着劳动保护和安全的种种设施，如按装通风机、安全装备及挡板等等，都已实行。去年工会组织比一九四八年多送了三十一万五千名工人和职员的儿童到夏令营去。去年新建造了五百多个俱乐部，新开设了二千一百个图书馆和一千个工会俱乐部及电影院。
    全苏工会中央理事会主席团决定于一月和二月间，在工厂与作坊、铁路与建筑场所、国营农场、机器与拖拉机站及其他企业中，订立一九五零年的新集体合同。这将是把苏联工人与职员团结起来，争取提早完成五年计划的经济与政治的群众运动。
