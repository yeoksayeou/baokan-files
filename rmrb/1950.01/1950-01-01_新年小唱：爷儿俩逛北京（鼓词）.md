Spring arrives, the river melts, and the east wind blows,
　　Willow branches turn green,
　　Wild geese and swallows return to the north,
　　The yellow earth loosens.
　　Old Man Wang is preparing to go to the fields,
　　But is missing two essential tools.
　　His grandson is busy producing in the factory,
　　So I'll visit him and take a trip to Beijing.
　　He cracks his whip with a loud sound,
　　And heads towards Beijing along the main road.
　　The spring breeze touches his face, but he doesn't feel cold,
　　He opens his cotton-padded coat.
　　His silver beard flutters in the wind,
　　His ruddy face is full of joy.
　　Distant mountains and nearby waters are like a painting,
　　The donkey's steps are quick and light.
　　The sun is just overhead,
　　And the old man enters Beijing City.

　　Beijing has a new look,
　　Celebrating the New Year with joy and harmony.
　　The sky is blue and the weather is good,
　　Everywhere, flags flutter bright red.
　　Cars and horses throng like a tide,
　　Drums and gongs resound throughout Beijing!
　　From the east comes a troupe of Yangge dancers,
　　From the north, waist drums beat "dong, dong, dong,"
　　From the south, silver bells jingle,
　　Children practice the Overlord Whip until their faces turn red.
　　He's busy looking south and can't look north,
　　He's busy looking and can't listen,
　　Suddenly someone grabs his hand,
　　Startling the old man!
　　The old man turns around to look,
　　And sees his grandson smiling.
　　"Grandpa, you're really happy,
　　Before, the millet you carried would have been lost,
　　Last night we had a party,
　　And it was my turn to rest this afternoon.
　　If I hadn't recognized the donkey from afar,
　　We would have passed each other without meeting."
　　"Let's sell the grain first,
　　Then stable the donkey, eat, and tour Beijing."
　　"The grain market is just a little over a mile away,
　　East along the city wall.
　　Sacks and measures fill the market,
　　A great concentration of the fruits of labor.
　　Rice and wheat are as white as silver and snow,
　　Millet is golden and sorghum red.
　　A broker comes over and calls out to the old man,
　　Offering to help him complete the transaction.
　　The old man's mind races,
　　He knows the measurers can be tricky!
　　The broker understands what he means,
　　And says, "Old man, listen:
　　The People's Market is fair,
　　No cheating on the scales or measures.
　　This is my service certificate,
　　If there's a mistake, you can always come back!"
　　His grandson pours out the sacks,
　　One measure after another.
　　From the tickets, the old man counts out eight hundred yuan,
　　And wants to thank the broker for his kindness.
　　The broker waves his hand and says, "No need!
　　Corrupt practices have been swept away,
　　I only hope you have a good harvest this autumn,
　　And that you come back to make more transactions!"
　　The old man nods and praises the new society:
　　"Everyone's mind is clear."
　　After stabling the donkey, they have a simple meal,
　　Fried dishes, baked pancakes, and two cups of wine.
　　The liberated old man is refreshed,
　　And the two of them are ready to tour Beijing!
　　The old man wants to buy something, and his grandson says, "You can get it at the trade company."
　　They walk through the streets,
　　And a large building appears before them.
　　His grandson steps up the stairs,
　　And the old man shouts from behind:
　　"I don't dare enter such a big shop,
　　Son, are you crazy?
　　Big businesses care about profit,
　　And they'll take you for all you're worth!"
　　His words make his grandson laugh,
　　Pointing and explaining to the old man:
　　"This business is like we're running it ourselves,
　　The goods are complete and the prices are low."
　　The old man hesitates for a long time before entering,
　　Busy looking around:
　　Dazzled by the colorful goods,
　　Hanging flags and red lanterns.
　　He picks and chooses to his heart's content,
　　And the salespeople smile.
　　He buys a scarf and gloves,
　　And wants to tour the surrounding area.
　　He looks up and sees a painting,
　　He really likes it but doesn't say anything.
　　He wants to buy it but is afraid his grandson will laugh,
　　Afraid that the boy will laugh at him for being an old child!
　　He stands in front of the painting unwilling to leave,
　　Staring at it, dawdling.
　　"I'll give Grandpa a gift,
　　It's called, a goose feather from afar, don't think it's too light!"
　　A painting, it's the same as the one on the wall!
　　The old man calls his grandson "good boy" twice:
　　"I can recognize the people on the city wall,
　　But there are too many people below to recognize.
　　The one reviewing the troops is Commander-in-Chief Zhu,
　　And the one speaking is the savior Mao Zedong!"
　　"I'm also in this painting,
　　If you can recognize me, Grandpa has good eyes!
　　On the National Day of October 1st,
　　I saw Mao Zedong with my own eyes!
　　Countless tanks and cannons,
　　Airplanes flying in the sky.
　　Flags cover the sky red as fire,
　　A lantern parade like a fire dragon."
　　They tour the park and Beihai,
　　And the old man wants to visit a factory.
　　Little Tie'er is happy to hear this,
　　Grabbing the old man and walking like the wind.
　　They walk for three miles,
　　Tiring the old man until he's sweating.
　　A large chimney stretches into the sky,
　　The flames in the large furnace burn brightly red.
　　Small guns and large cannons are shiny black,
　　The water pumps are made fine and precise,
　　The guns and cannons are used to fight the enemy,
　　And the large water pumps perform great deeds in the power plant!
　　The workers greet the old man warmly,
　　Calling him "Grandpa" and "Uncle."
　　The masters all praise the old man's grandson for his good work,
　　And the fellow apprentices all say the old man's grandson has a red heart.
　　The old man is so happy he can't close his mouth,
　　And they hand him tea, water, and cigarettes.
　　In the evening, the old man watches a play,
　　The auditorium is filled with singing and laughter.
　　It's about the factory increasing production by an inch,
　　It's about the worker heroes making great contributions.
　　The play goes on until late at night,
　　And the old man returns to the dormitory.
　　Under the lamplight, the grandfather and grandson chat:
　　"In a word, child, you must remember this:
　　Always follow the Communist Party,
　　Study hard and work hard,
　　Young people have endless joy.
　　Old man I, will do a good job in the fields at home,
　　And grow more grain to live in peace."
　　The old man sleeps soundly,
　　And sleeps until the sun is red.
　　He buys a sickle and a harrow on the street,
　　And his grandson returns to the factory to work.
　　He whips the donkey fast, then slow,
　　Leaves the city to go home and plant the land,
　　And when he's idle, he talks about Beijing:
　　"The ancient city of hundreds of years has been turned upside down,
　　And has become the People's new capital,
　　Talking about construction, Beijing must take the lead,
　　The Communist Party is our eternally bright guiding light!"

    新年小唱：爷儿俩逛北京（鼓词）
    沈彭年
    春至河开刮东风，
    柳树条儿发了青，
    大雁小燕回了北，
    黄黄的土地发了松。
    王老汉，一心打点着要下地，
    随手的家伙还缺两宗。
    孙孙在厂里忙生产，
    顺便看他我进趟京。
    鞭子一摇、抽了个响亮，
    顺着大道奔了京城。
    春风扑脸脸儿不觉冷，
    解开了二大棉袄敞开胸。
    银白的胡须风飘动，
    枣红的脸膛儿喜盈盈。
    远山近水像张画儿，
    毛驴的脚步快又轻。
    老阳儿，刚刚转到当头上，
    老汉进了北京城。
    京城一片新气象，
    庆祝新年喜融融。
    蓝汪汪的天空天气好，
    到处是，旗子飘飘鲜又红。
    车马拥挤如潮水，
    锣鼓喧天满京城！
    东边儿来了伙子秧歌队，
    北边儿的腰鼓咚咚咚，
    南边儿是银铃当啷啷响，
    霸王鞭练得小孩儿们脸发红。
    顾了南来、顾不了北，
    顾了看来、顾不了听，
    猛然手被人拉住，
    倒叫老汉吃一惊！
    老汉回头忙观看，
    看见孙子笑出声。
    ：“爷爷您可真高兴，
    在以前，您带的小米儿早丢空，
    昨夜晚开了一个联欢会，
    轮着我，今天下午歇了工。
    不是我远远的就把毛驴儿认，
    闹了个，人走对面不相逢。”
    ：“咱们先把粮食粜，
    存驴、吃饭再逛京城。”
    ：“粮食市儿，离此不过里把地，
    顺着城墙往正东。
    口袋升斗堆满了市，
    劳动果实大集中。
    稻米白面如银又似雪，
    小米金黄高粱红。
    有经纪，过来又把老乡叫，
    要替老汉把交易成。
    老汉他心里滴溜打了个转儿，
    升斗牙子可缠不清！
    经纪明白他心中意，
    叫声老乡你是听：
    “人民市场讲公道，
    不许吃秤吃斗升。
    这是我的服务证，
    有错儿尽管找回程！”
    孙孙他，一旁就把口袋倒，
    过了一斗又一升。
    票子里，老汉数出钱八百，
    要谢经纪的好人情。
    经纪摆手说：“不用！
    腐败习惯一扫清，
    只望您，今年大秋收成好，
    老乡您，再来多把交易成！”
    点头咂嘴称赞新社会：
    “人人的脑筋都打的通。”
    存驴打尖用了饭，
    炒菜烙饼酒两盅。
    翻身的老汉精神爽，
    爷儿俩要大逛北京城！
    老汉要把东西买，孙孙说：“贸易公司就能成。”
    穿街过巷往前走，
    一座大楼面前迎，
    孙孙他抬腿就把台阶儿上，
    老汉在后面喊连声：
    “这么大的铺子可不敢进，
    小子你莫非发了疯？
    买卖大了看利重，
    一杠子抡上就不轻！”
    一句话逗的孙孙笑，
    指手划脚告诉老汉听：
    “这买卖如同咱们自家干，
    货色儿又全价钱又轻。”
    老汉他犹疑半晌把门进，
    忙闪二目看分明：
    花花绿绿瞧花了眼，
    挂满了旗子悬红灯。
    翻来覆去挑了个够，
    卖货的人儿笑盈盈。
    脖子手巾买齐整，
    要把周围逛一程。
    抬头看见一张画儿，
    心里真爱可不知声。
    有心要买怕孙子笑，
    怕铁儿笑他老儿童！
    站在画前不愿走，
    直着眼睛瞎磨蹭。
    “我送爷爷一样儿礼，
    这叫作，千里鹅毛别嫌轻”！
    一张画儿，它和墙上的一个样儿！
    老汉他，连把乖孩子叫两声：
    “这城上的人物我能认，
    城下人多可认不清。
    阅兵的本是朱总司令，
    讲话的就是救星毛泽东！”
    “这张画儿上也有我，
    认的出，就算爷爷好眼睛！
    十月一日开国典，
    亲眼看见了毛泽东！
    战车大炮无其数，
    飞机飞在半悬空。
    旗子遮天红似火，
    提灯大会赛火龙。”
    逛了公园逛北海，
    老汉他，要去工厂走一样。
    小铁儿闻听心欢喜，
    拉住了老汉走如风。
    一走走了路三里，
    累的老汉汗津津。
    大烟囱伸到半天空，
    大熔炉火苗儿旺得红通通。
    小枪大炮乌油亮，
    水泵做的细又精，
    枪炮用来把敌人打，
    大水泵，发电厂里立大功！
    工人们，接待老汉真亲热，
    爷爷、大爷叫连声。
    师傅们，都夸老汉的孙孙干活儿好，
    师兄弟，都说老汉的孙孙人心红。
    直乐得，老汉嘴也闭不上，
    茶水纸烟递手中。
    到晚来，老汉又把话剧看，
    礼堂内，歌声笑声闹烘烘。
    演的是，工厂生产长一寸；
    演的是，工人英雄立大功。
    一演演到大夜半，
    老汉回到宿舍中。
    灯光下，祖孙爷儿闲话扯：
    “一句话，孩子你要记心中：
    永远跟着共产党，
    勤学习勤工作，
    年青的人们乐无穷。
    老汉我，在家做好地里活，
    多打粮食过太平。”
    老汉安稳睡了觉，
    一觉睡到日头红。
    大街上买了镰刀和耙犁，
    孙孙回厂去上工。
    紧加鞭，慢加鞭，
    出城回家把地种，
    闲了来，高谈阔论北京城：
    “几百年的古城翻了个儿，
    成了人民的新京城，
    讲建设，京城要把头来带，
    共产党是咱的万年长明的指路灯！”
