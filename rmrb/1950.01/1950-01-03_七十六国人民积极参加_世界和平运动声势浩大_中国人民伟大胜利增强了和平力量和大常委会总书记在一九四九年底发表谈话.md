Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: TASS Paris dispatch: Rafael, General Secretary of the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, stated to representatives of the press at the end of 1949 that the committee maintains regular contact with the peace movements of seventy-six countries, that is, with almost all countries on the globe. Since the World Peace Congress was held, national peace committees have been established in forty-six countries. The peace movement has expanded, and its momentum has become increasingly vast. Since the World Peace Congress was held, national peace conferences have been held in twenty-six countries. On October 2nd—International Day of Struggle for Peace—grand demonstrations were held in sixty countries. Rafael emphasized that the Soviet Peace Committee has made a huge contribution to the world peace movement. Speaking of the great victory of the Chinese people, Rafael pointed out that the liberation of China means that the peace-loving forces of the world have gained the great support of people who account for almost a quarter of the world's population. The grand American Peace Congress held in Mexico City in September was attended by representatives from twenty-eight countries. The recent National Labor Union Peace Congress in Chicago, USA, demanded a ban on the atomic bomb. The peace movement is extremely large in scale in many countries, and this movement is of great significance, especially in Australia, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, and India. In India, despite various repressive measures, the All-India Peace Conference was still held in Calcutta. In Japan, the Peace Defense Association has seven million members, representing a broad and powerful front across the country, one of its main goals is to defend peace. The peace movement in Europe is also of magnificent scale, especially in France, Italy, the Netherlands, and the German Democratic Republic. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress is preparing to select international delegations to visit various countries, especially the United States, the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. Rafael finally declared that the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress is scheduled to convene a plenary meeting in April 1950.
