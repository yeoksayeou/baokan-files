    Record of the Repair of the Beijing-Hankou and Guangzhou-Hankou Railways
    Direct Through Traffic Resumes on the Beijing-Hankou and Guangzhou-Hankou Railways After Twelve Years of Interruption

    On New Year's Day, 1950, direct through traffic began between Beijing and Hankou, and between Guangzhou and Wuchang. North China and South China, which had been separated for more than ten years, were thus reconnected. The full restoration and opening to traffic of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway is a major contribution of the brave and hardworking Chinese working people to the economic recovery and construction of the motherland. At the same time, this is also the most powerful answer to all those who doubt that railways cannot be built without American materials. Traffic on the Beijing-Hankou Railway had been interrupted for twelve years. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the railway was thoroughly destroyed by the heroic Chinese people who defended their country: steel rails and sleepers were gone, bridges were gone, and in some sections even the roadbed was leveled into farmland. What about the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, which was liberated section by section from May to October last year? All the bridges were destroyed by the fleeing Kuomintang bandit troops, and many steel rails and sleepers were also removed. In 1949, when the Liberation War was still in full swing and the national finances were extremely difficult, the restoration of these two thousand kilometers of damaged railways was unimaginable at that time, given the lack of tools and materials and the various difficulties. However, after only a short year, a brand-new People's Railway stretched all the way from Beijing to the coast of South China.

            Farmers Along the Line Respond to Chairman Mao's Call to Launch a Movement to Donate Materials

    This is a miracle, this is the victory of the people. In January last year, the employees of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the farmers along the line, in response to Chairman Mao's call, began to rush to repair the sections from Beijing to Baoding and from Xuchang to Yancheng in Henan Province in order to support the army's advance to the south. In order to solve the difficulties of steel rails, sleepers, spikes and other materials, railway employees and farmers along the line launched a movement to donate materials. Most of the materials used in the Beijing-Hankou Railway restoration project were donated by railway employees and farmers along the line. Eighty percent of the materials used to repair the railway from Baoding to Shijiazhuang were collected from the people along the line. The farmers in various counties of Hebei Province donated all the rails and other equipment they had dismantled during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the early stages of the Liberation War. Zanhuang County alone collected more than 2,000 steel rails, most of which were carried by farmers from the mountains to the railway line. Yuanshi County collected more than 5,000 steel rails and more than 4,000 catties of spikes, as well as many splints and signal lights used at the stations. The farmers in Wucun, the county, jumped into the Zulong River in spite of the cold weather and salvaged many steel rails that they had sunk to the bottom of the river during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Similarly, the farmers on the banks of the Fuyang River in Nandou, Hebei Province, also salvaged more than 2,000 steel rails from the Fuyang River and from the coal mines in Cixian County. The restoration of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway also encountered the same difficulty of lack of timber. The Hengyang Railway Bureau once planned to request the Ministry of Railways to allocate 40 million sleepers, but the Ministry of Railways replied with the eight words "Overcome difficulties, obtain materials locally." Therefore, the railway employees and the people along the line, under the call of Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan to "build a family diligently and regenerate oneself," braved the rain to go to the mountains dozens of miles away from the railway line to cut wood. The farmers even gave the wood they had prepared for coffins to the railway. The farmers of Liaojiashan near Dengjiatang, Chen County, Hunan Province, generously donated the entire forest of Liaojiashan to the state.

            Railway Employees Take the Lead in Donating and Collecting Materials to Support the Rush Repair

    Railway employees played a heroic vanguard role in donating and collecting materials. The railway employees in Changxindian often went to distant villages to collect or transport materials without eating or resting. The employees of the Wuchang Locomotive Depot and the Vehicle Inspection Department of the Machinery Factory immediately organized a railway equipment collection committee when they heard the good news of the liberation of Guangzhou, and went to ponds and deep soil to salvage and excavate equipment that had been destroyed and abandoned by the Kuomintang bandits during their spare time. The employees in the railway factory put forward the slogan of supporting the rush repair in the front and stepped up the production of spikes and bridge-building equipment. In late November last year, all the ironworkers and riveters of the Hengyang Machinery Factory participated in the on-site work of bridge repair. The factory accepted the task of manufacturing 1,800 bridge screws in two days. At that time, there were neither blacksmiths nor raw materials, so the workers used scrap iron as raw materials and learned while working, completing this urgent task with two days and two nights of non-stop work. The workers of the Wuchang Machinery Factory, who were responsible for supplying bridge-building materials, also always worked overtime to complete the task ahead of schedule. In October last year, when the employees of the Jiang'an Repair Factory in Hankou heard the news of the founding of the Central People's Government, they immediately decided to increase their voluntary work by one hour every day and use waste materials to manufacture handcars and riveting machines to donate to the state. The workers of the Jiang'an Bridge Factory also completed the two-hole steel beam, which they had planned to complete in 28 days, in half a month ahead of schedule.

            Soldiers of the Railway Corps and Employees of the Two Railways Heroically Sacrifice Themselves to Rush the Repair

    The Beijing-Hankou and Guangzhou-Hankou Railways were restored by the railway employees of the two railways and the Railway Corps with the help of the farmers along the line. The restoration of the Beijing-Hankou Railway took almost the whole year of last year, and the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway also took more than six months. During this period, the railway employees and the soldiers of the Railway Corps conquered the severe cold of the northern winter with selfless labor, and also conquered the scorching heat of July in the south. Especially the soldiers of the Railway Corps, based on the employees of the Northeast Railway, were not used to the scorching heat of the south; they also encountered continuous rain during the restoration of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway. They were unaccustomed to the climate and suffered from various diseases. Even so, it did not frustrate their determination to follow the army in repairing roads and advancing. The restoration of the Beijing-Hankou and Guangzhou-Hankou Railways was exchanged for the blood and sweat of the employees and soldiers. Many of them also paid the price of their lives.

    In the project of repairing the Wushengguan Tunnel, which was destroyed by the White bandit Chongxi, on the southern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, Che Zilin, a worker from the third detachment of the Xinyang Rush Repair Headquarters, automatically took on the most dangerous task of erecting scaffolds in the cave. The destroyed cave could collapse at any time, and if stones fell while walking back and forth on the scaffolds in the dark cave, it would be impossible to avoid them. Every worker was worried about him, but he said: "It doesn't matter, what is personal life and death?" When repairing the Wukong River Bridge on the section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway from Baoding to Shijiazhuang, the workers bravely erected and moved scaffolds in the frozen river water. Once, the river water washed away the wooden stakes, and Zhai Zen'ger and Zhao Shuangyin, members of the New Democratic Youth League among the workers, jumped into the water without even taking off their clothes in order to rescue the materials. When repairing the Shahe Bridge in this section, the workers overcame the attacks of storms and mountain floods four times, rescued materials from the floods, and reorganized the destroyed bridge foundation and the inclined caisson. Many projects on the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway were even more difficult, and the rainy season in the south occurred during the restoration period. The workers and soldiers often waded through half a foot of mud to transport stones and wood dozens of miles away. When repairing a high bridge on the railway, the soldiers worked on steel frames more than ten feet high, and if they accidentally fell, they would be crushed to pieces, but no one flinched. When repairing the Leihe Bridge in Leiyang, Hunan Province, because the bottom of the river was sunk with steel plates and piles could not be driven, workers Zhang Qi and others took the lead in taking on the work of diving and salvaging. Just like the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who were wounded in battle and did not want to leave the front line, the workers who were slightly injured were reluctant to rest. During the restoration of a section of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, worker Lin Yunshan's hips and arms were injured by a fall, but he insisted on continuing to work. When repairing the line at Chashanao, north of Hengyang, worker Zhao Ke was crushed under the sand and stones of a collapsed cliff and was seriously injured; but he only stayed in the hospital for four days, and then participated in the work again with a cane.

            Supporting the People's Liberation Army's Advance, Competition to Rush Repair Completed the Full Line Ahead of Schedule

    Despite the arduous project, the construction sites were filled with high labor enthusiasm. At every construction site, in addition to the clanging of iron and stone, you could often hear a thunderous cheer. The workers and soldiers sometimes shouted the slogans "Add oil!" "Add oil!", and sometimes sang: "Work hard—eh yo!" "Fight Lao Jiang—eh yo!" In this way, in order to support the advancing People's Liberation Army, they rushed to repair day and night, and they competed with each other. In this way, many major projects of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway were completed ahead of schedule. The full restoration of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway were also completed a few days ahead of schedule.

            The Major Reason for the Rapid Opening of the Two Major Railways is the Enthusiastic Help of Soviet Experts

    The rapid restoration and opening of the two major railways makes people unforgettable the great help of the Soviet Union. The enthusiastic help of the most experienced Soviet experts in railway restoration after World War II is a major reason for the rapid opening of the Beijing-Hankou and Guangzhou-Hankou Railways. They participated in the on-site work like Chinese employees, and endured the hot summer weather in the south. They cooperated with Chinese engineers, jointly designed, they were not completely bound by engineering conventions, but based on actual needs and actual conditions to study the revolutionary technical views of design, to help Chinese engineers overcome many engineering difficulties. In the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway restoration project, because of the lack of wood, Soviet experts suggested using short wood for jointing. The results of the experiment proved that the joints of the wood were very strong and completely successful. Soviet experts also had many new suggestions on bridge restoration, which overcame difficulties and saved materials. The enthusiasm and responsibility of the Soviet experts for the project moved the participating employees very much. During the restoration of the line between Yueyang and Changsha, when the sleepers did not arrive and the project was stalled, the Soviet experts called the Wuchang material warehouse to urge them. He did not sleep at night, urging them every ten minutes, and notified all stations along the way by telephone, not to sleep until the sleepers were transported. In short, thanks to the enthusiasm of the Soviet experts, many difficult projects were completed quickly.

    The Beijing-Hankou and Guangzhou-Hankou Railways are open to traffic. The farmers of Yuanshi County, Hebei Province, said: "When the railway is open, cotton will have legs. In the future, we will grow more cotton without the government mobilizing us." Undoubtedly, the opening of the two major railways will bring economic recovery and prosperity to the new China. With the efforts of the brave and hardworking Chinese working people, and with the assistance of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, after the Beijing-Hankou and Guangzhou-Hankou Railways, there will be new People's Railways, crossing the vast fields of the motherland.

    京汉、粤汉铁路修复记
    中断十二年之久的京汉、粤汉铁路直达通车了
    一九五零年元旦日，北京和汉口之间，广州和武昌之间开始了直达通车，被阻隔了十多年的华北和华南从此又联接起来了。京汉铁路和粤汉铁路的全线修复通车，是勇敢勤劳的我国劳动人民，对祖国进行经济恢复和建设的一个重大的贡献。同时，这对于一切怀疑没有美国物资就不能修建铁路的人来说，也是一个最有力的回答。京汉铁路交通中断已有十二年之久。该铁路在抗日战争中即为英勇卫国的中国人民所彻底破坏：钢轨枕木没有了，桥梁没有了，有的地段连路基也被平为田地。从去年五月到十月一段一段地解放的粤汉铁路呢？所有的桥梁被溃逃的国民党匪军破坏了，许多钢轨枕木也被搬走了。在解放战争还在紧张地进行，国家财政极端困难的一九四九年，在工具、材料缺乏的种种困难下，这两千多公里的被破坏了的铁路的修复，在当时是难以想象的。然而短短的一年过去后，一条崭新的人民铁道就从北京一直伸到了南中国的海岸。
            沿线农民响应毛主席号召展开献交器材运动
    这是奇迹，这是人民的胜利。去年一月，京汉铁路的员工和沿线农民，响应毛主席的号召，为支援大军南进，就开始抢修北京到保定和河南省许昌到郾城两段。为了解决钢轨、枕木、道钉等器材的困难，铁路员工和沿线农民都展开了献交器材的运动。京汉铁路修复工程中所用的材料，大部分是由铁路员工和沿线农民献交出来的。修复保定到石家庄一段铁路所用的材料，百分之八十都是从沿线人民手中搜集的。河北省各县的农民，他们把八年抗日战争中和解放战争初期拆除的铁轨等器材全部都献交出来了。赞皇一个县就搜集了两千多根钢轨，大部分都是由农民从山中抬送到铁路线上的。元氏一个县就搜集五千多根钢轨和四千多斤道钉，还有很多夹板和车站上用的号志灯。该县吴村的农民，不顾天寒水冷，跳到潴龙河里打捞了许多他们在抗日战争时期沉到河底的钢轨。同样，河北省南都滏阳河畔的农民，他们也从滏阳河里，从磁县的煤井里，打捞了钢轨两千多根。粤汉铁路的修复中也曾同样发生木材缺乏的困难，衡阳铁路局曾拟向铁道部要求拨发枕木四千万根，但铁道部的答复却是“克服困难，就地取材”八个字。于是，铁路员工和沿线人民在铁道部滕代远部长所提的“刻苦兴家、自力更生”的号召下，冒雨到离铁路线几十里以外的山上去采伐木料。农民们甚至把准备作棺材的木料都让给了铁路。湖南省郴县邓家塘附近廖家山的农民，把廖家山全山的林木，都慷慨地献给了国家。
            铁路员工英勇当先献交和搜集器材支援抢修
    铁路员工在献交器材和搜集器材中，表现了他们英勇的先锋作用。长辛店的铁路员工，他们常常不吃饭、不休息到很远的乡村中去搜集或搬运。武昌机务段和机器厂检车所的员工，在听到广州解放的捷报时，立刻就组织了铁路器材搜集委员会，在工余的时间，到池沼和深土中去打捞和挖掘被国民党匪帮破坏和遗弃的器材。在铁路工厂中的员工，则提出支援前方抢修的口号，加紧生产道钉和架桥器材。去年十一月下旬，衡阳机厂全部铁工和铆工都参加了修桥的现场工作。工厂却接受了要在两天中制造一千八百个桥梁螺丝的任务。当时既没有会打铁的人，又没有原料，工人们就用废铁作原料边学边打，以两天两夜不休息的劳动，完成了这一项紧急的任务。武昌机厂所负担供给架桥材料的工人，同样每次都是加夜工提前赶成的。去年十月，汉口江岸修配厂员工听到中央人民政府成立的消息，立刻就决议每天增加义务工一小时，并利用废料制造摇车和铆钉机献给国家。江岸桥梁厂的工人，也把他们计划在二十八天完成的两孔钢梁，提前在半个月内就完成了。
            铁道兵团的战士和两路员工英勇牺牲奋力抢修
    京汉、粤汉两路，是由两路的铁路员工和铁道兵团在沿线农民的援助下修复的。京汉铁路修复差不多经过去年整整一年，粤汉铁路也经过了六个多月。这中间，铁路员工和铁道兵团的战士们，他们以奋不顾身的劳动，征服了北方冬季的严寒，也征服了南方七月的酷热。特别是以东北铁路员工为基干的铁道兵团的战士们，他们不习惯南方的酷热；在修复粤汉铁路中又遇到连绵阴雨。他们水土不服，疾病丛生。就这样也没有挫折他们随军修路前进的锐气。京汉、粤汉的修复，是员工们和战士们用血和汗换来的。其中许多人还付出了生命的代价。
    在修复京汉南段被白匪崇禧炸毁了的武胜关隧道的工程中，信阳抢修总队第三分队的工人车字林，自动担任最危险的在洞中搭架的工作。被破坏了的山洞随时都会坍下，在阴暗的洞中的架上来回，假如有石块落下也是无法躲避的。每一个工友都为他耽心，而他却说：“不要紧，个人的生死算什么。”在修复京汉路保定到石家庄段上的悟空河桥时，在冰冻的河水中工人们都奋不顾身地搭架移架。有一次河水把木桩冲走了工人中的新民主主义青年团团员翟增尔和赵双印，为了抢救材料，他们连衣服也没有脱就跳下水去了。在修复这一段的沙河桥时，工人们曾四次战胜暴风雨和山洪的袭击，从洪水中抢救器材和重整被冲毁的桥基和被冲斜的沉箱。粤汉路的许多工程更加艰苦，修复期中又正遇南方的雨季，工人们、战士们，有好多次是跋涉在半尺深的淤泥中，到数十里外搬运石料和木料。在修复该路的某一座高桥时，战士们在十多丈高的钢架上进行工作，偶一不慎跌下来就是粉身碎骨，但是却没有一个人畏缩不前。在修复湖南省耒河桥时，因河底沉有钢板无法打桩，工人张琪等四人就争先恐后地担任潜水打捞的工作。正象人民解放军的战士在战斗中负了伤不愿下火线一样，工人们负了轻伤也多不愿休息。在修复粤汉路某段中，工人林云山的臀部和胳膊都跌伤了，但他还是坚持要继续作工。在修复衡阳以北茶山坳的线路时，工人赵科被塌下来的山崖沙石压在下面，受了重伤；但他也只在医院中住了四天，就扶着手杖又参加了工作。
            支援解放军前进竞赛赶修提前完成了修通全线
    尽管工程艰苦，但是，当时在每一个施工的现场上都沸腾着高涨的劳动热情。在每一个施工的现场上，你除了听到一片叮叮当当的铁石声外，还常常可以听到一片雷动的欢呼。工人们、战士们有时是喊着“加油！”“加油！”的口号有时是在歌唱：“加油干呀——呃哟！”“打老蒋呀——呃哟！”就这样，为了支援前进中的人民解放军，他们日夜赶修，他们互相竞赛。就这样，粤汉路的许多重大工程都是提前完成的。京汉铁路和粤汉铁路全线修复，也都是提前了几天完成的。
            两大铁路迅速通车的重大原因是苏联专家的热情帮助
    两大铁路的迅速修复通车，使人不能忘怀的是苏联的伟大的帮助。我们获得第二次世界大战后苏联修复铁路最有经验的专家的热情帮助，是京汉、粤汉迅速通车的重大原因。他们和中国的员工一样参加现场的工作，饱经了南方的盛暑天气。他们和中国工程师合作，共同设计，他们不完全拘于工程陈规，而根据实际需要和实际情况研究设计的革命的技术观点，帮助中国工程师克服了许多工程上的困难。在粤汉路修复工程中，因为木料缺乏，苏联专家就建议用短木接用。试验的结果证明木料的接榫处非常坚固，完全成功。在桥梁修复上，苏联专家也有许多新的建议，克服了困难，节约了材料。苏联专家们，他们对工程的热心和负责，使参加修复的员工们非常感动。在修复岳阳长沙间的线路中，因为枕木未到工程停顿时，苏联专家就打电话给武昌材料库催问。他夜间不睡觉，每隔十分钟就催一次，并且用电话通知沿途各站，不把枕木运完也不要睡。总之，由于苏联专家的热心，使得许多艰巨的工程得以迅速完成。
    京汉、粤汉通车了，河北省元氏县的农民说：“铁路通了，棉花有了腿。往后不用政府动员我们也要多种棉花。”无疑的，两大铁路的通车，将为新中国带来经济的恢复和繁荣。在英勇勤劳的我国劳动人民的努力下，在苏联和人民民主国家的协助下，继京汉、粤汉之后，将有新的人民铁道，跨越祖国的辽阔的原野。
