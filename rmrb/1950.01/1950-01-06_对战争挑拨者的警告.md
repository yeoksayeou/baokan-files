    Warning to Warmongers

    From December 25th to 30th, the military tribunal of the Soviet Maritime Territory tried the case of former Japanese Kwantung Army Commander Otozo Yamada and eleven other bacterial warfare criminals. These six days of trial were not only a trial of the inhumane Japanese war criminals, but also a trial of the equally cruel and vicious new warmongers.

    This trial proved that: in order to realize its heinous aggressive plans, the Japanese military clique, in accordance with Emperor Hirohito's secret edict, organized special forces to prepare for and conduct bacteriological warfare. This trial proved that: when these special forces—Units 731 and 100—were massively "researching," "experimenting," and manufacturing bacterial weapons, more than 3,000 Chinese patriotic people, prisoners of war, as well as some Soviet people and Mongolian people were cruelly infected with deadly bacteria and died. This trial proved that: Japanese fascists spread plague and other infectious disease bacteria in Ningbo, Changde and other areas of the Chinese battlefield. This trial proved that: the Japanese aggressors took the Soviet Union as the main target for large-scale bacteriological warfare, and released bacteria on the Soviet border. Only the irresistible offensive of the Soviet army, which quickly liberated the entire Northeast, shattered the Japanese ruling group's criminal plan to launch bacteriological warfare.

    Of particular importance, during the course of this trial, the US imperialism's attempt to use the most brutal new weapons to massacre mankind was once again exposed, the criminal connection between the American warmongers and the Japanese war criminal clique was once again exposed, and the danger of the US imperialism's determination to undermine the joint agreement on severely punishing Japanese war criminals in the Potsdam Declaration was once again proven. As early as the autumn of 1947, the US Department of the Army had already established "experimental stations" and "testing grounds" for researching bacterial weapons near Washington. On the same day the Khabarovsk Military Tribunal opened—December 25th—MacArthur announced a "pardon," releasing forty-six Japanese war criminals on the grounds of "good behavior in prison," and was even considering a "release system" "applicable to those serving sentences, including life imprisonment." MacArthur's spokesmen publicly defended those criminals, shamelessly claiming that the Khabarovsk trial "may be fabricated" and that "nothing has been found to prove that the Japanese army used bacteriological weapons in World War II." Everyone knows that US imperialism's protection and indulgence of Japanese war criminals did not begin today. As early as the Tokyo International Military Tribunal's trial of the major Japanese war criminals, US imperialism made its greatest efforts to shield or mitigate the crimes of the Japanese war criminal clique. One of the main culprits in this case—bacterial expert and organizer of bacteriological warfare, Shiro Ishii, Kitano and Wakamatsu, and many other major and minor war criminals, not only remain at large, but many are also reused by US imperialism.

    Now, these twelve Japanese war criminals have received their deserved punishment of long prison terms, which is also a serious warning to all warmongers, because, as the Soviet State Prosecutor pointed out: "The powerful democratic front headed by the Soviet Union is defending peace and security. This is a powerful and invincible force that will be able to suppress every instigator of a new war and give them severe punishment."

### 对战争挑拨者的警告

    对战争挑拨者的警告
    从十二月二十五日起至三十日为止，苏联滨海军区军事法庭审讯前日本关东军司令山田乙三等十二人的细菌战犯案。这六天的审讯，不仅是审判着灭绝人性的日本战犯，也是审判着同样残酷狠毒的新战争挑拨者。
    这次审讯证明：日本军阀为实现其罪恶的侵略计划，曾按照裕仁天皇的秘密敕令，组织特种部队，来准备和进行细菌战争。这次审讯证明：当这些特种部队——七三一和一百号部队大规模地“研究”、“实验”和制造细菌武器时，曾有三千以上的中国爱国志士、俘虏以及一部分的苏联人民、蒙古人民被残忍地传染了杀人细菌而致死。这次审讯证明：日本法西斯在中国战场的宁波、常德和其它地区，散播鼠疫和其它传染病的细菌。这次审讯证明：日本侵略者以苏联为进行大规模细菌战争的主要对象，并曾在苏联边境施放细菌，只是由于苏联军队的锐不可当的攻势，迅速解放东北全境，才粉碎了日本统治集团发动细菌战争的罪恶计划。
    尤其重要的，在这次审讯的过程中，又一次揭破了美帝国主义企图用最残暴的新武器屠杀人类，又一次暴露了美国战争挑拨者与日本战犯集团的罪恶联系，又一次证明了美帝国主义决心破坏波茨坦宣言中关于严惩日本战犯的共同协定的危险性。早在一九四七年的秋天，美国陆军部就已经在华盛顿附近设立了研究细菌武器的“实验站”和“试验场”。在伯力军事法庭开庭的同一天——十二月二十五日，麦克阿瑟宣布“特赦”，他以“在监狱内表现良好为理由”，释放日本战犯四十六名，并且还在考虑“将适用于正受徒刑包括无期徒刑在内”的一种“释放制度”。麦克阿瑟的代言人公开为那些罪犯辩护，无耻地扬言伯力审判“可能是捏造”，“没有发现任何东西足以证明日军在第二次世界大战中使用细菌武器”。谁都知道，美帝国主义对日本战犯的包庇和纵容，并不自今日始，早在东京国际军事法庭对日本主要战犯的审讯中，美帝国主义即以最大的努力来庇护或减轻日本战犯集团的罪行，本案的主犯之一——细菌专家、细菌战争的组织者石井四郎、北野和若松等要犯，以及其他许多大小战犯，不仅依然逍遥法外，而且有不少还为美帝国主义所重用。
    现在，这十二名日本战犯都已受到长期徒刑的应得惩罚，这同时亦是对所有战争挑拨者的一个严重警告，因为这正如苏联国家检察官所指出的：“以苏联为首的强大的民主阵线，在保卫着和平与安全。这是一个强大的和战无不胜的力量，这个力量将能压制新战争的每一个煽动者，并予以严厉的惩罚。”
