Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 23rd: Nguyen Khoa Dieu Hong, Chief Representative of the Vietnamese Women's Delegation and member of the National Committee of the Vietnam Women's Union, who came to China to attend the Asian Women's Representative Conference, issued a statement in Wuhan on the 15th regarding the recent atrocities of the French imperialist army in northern Vietnam in persecuting Overseas Chinese. Nguyen Khoa Dieu Hong first expressed, on behalf of the delegation, deep sympathy and condolences to the Overseas Chinese who suffered bloody persecution, and expressed angry protest against the barbaric acts of the French imperialist army. She then said, "When the Vietnamese People's Liberation War broke out, most of the Overseas Chinese, with the exception of a few elements exploited by French imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents, united with the Vietnamese people against the aggression of the French imperialist army. The unprecedented victory of the Chinese revolution has further encouraged the Overseas Chinese to have more confidence in the victory of their struggle against the oppression of the French imperialists. The French imperialists have further exposed their ferocious faces as enemies of the Chinese people, and have intensified their killing and persecution of Overseas Chinese." Nguyen Khoa Dieu Hong believes that the occurrence of this major tragedy of French imperialism persecuting Overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam will enable the Overseas Chinese and the Vietnamese people to further recognize the hideous faces of the French imperialists, and stand more closely and firmly together to jointly oppose the barbaric French imperialists.

    越妇女代表团首席代表阮科耀红发表谈话抗议法军迫害华侨
    【新华社北京二十三日电】为参加亚洲妇女代表会议而来到中国的越南妇女代表团首席代表、越南妇联全国委员会委员阮科耀红，十五日途经武汉时曾就越北法帝国主义军队最近又一次迫害越南华侨的暴行发表谈话。阮科耀红首先代表该代表团对受血腥迫害的华侨表示深切的同情和哀悼，对法帝国主义军队的野蛮行为表示忿怒的抗议。接着她说：“当越南人民解放战争爆发时，除了少数受法帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮特务利用的分子外，大部分华侨都和越南人民团结在一起，反对法帝国主义军队的侵略。最近中国革命的空前胜利，更加鼓舞了华侨反对法帝国主义者压迫斗争的胜利信心。而法帝国主义则更加暴露其与中国人民为敌的凶恶面目，愈发加紧了对华侨的残杀、迫害。”阮科耀红认为：此次越北法帝国主义迫害华侨的重大惨案的发生，将使越南华侨和越南人民进一步认清法帝国主义的狰狞面目，而更紧密更坚决地站在一起，共同反对野蛮的法国帝国主义者。
