I Saw New China
—Written for the Inauguration of "People's China"
World Federation of Trade Unions Vice Chairman Toledano

I came to China with an ardent desire to witness firsthand the great victory of the great Chinese people, a victory that created the People's Republic of China. Naturally, I longed to meet the leaders of the Chinese people and observe the attitude of the Chinese working people, industrial workers, peasants, intellectuals, and youth as they faced the enormous task of building a strong, prosperous, independent, and revolutionary New China.

I saw the long past of exploitation, ignorance, moral servitude, and sorrow of the old China dying; and a new world full of vitality, creative spirit, socialism, economic progress, democratic education, and high political consciousness being born here.

I saw land reform being universally implemented across this vast land, laying the foundation for the liberation of the majority of the people. As the living standards of the masses improve, industry will steadily progress; in this way, China will forever be rid of its economic backwardness and poverty.

The Chinese peasants' struggle against the landlords will inevitably cause widespread reactions not only in other Asian countries but also in Latin America. Because in many countries in our Latin America, semi-feudal structures that have existed for centuries still remain.

I saw the Chinese people enjoying complete freedom for the first time in history; I saw them exercising their political rights with great efficiency and joy.

The People's Republic of China is a true democracy; the people's democratic dictatorship against the oppressors enables the people to truly and directly participate in the government, various organizations, and all undertakings that promote the country's progress.

I saw how resolutely the Chinese people are defending their national sovereignty, restoring China's autonomy, and forever eliminating the aggression and sinister influence of foreign imperialism.

I saw how New China feels closely connected with other democratic countries, with the Soviet Union, with the people's democracies of Europe, and with the workers and progressive forces all over the world.

I saw how the people's democracy in China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, is becoming a bridge to a socialist country and the true liberation of mankind.

I also met Comrade Mao Zedong—the great leader who occupies a glorious page in human history. Whoever meets him cannot help but feel his extraordinary qualities and his profound, radiant wisdom; he has the mind of a Marxist theorist, a brilliant strategist, and a true leader; he has dedicated his whole being to the people's revolutionary cause. These qualities enable him to stand shoulder to shoulder with the leader of the world proletariat—Stalin—in the vanguard of the people of the world.

In 1935, I extensively introduced the Soviet Union to the broad masses of our people; at that time, only a few people knew about the Soviet Union. Now, it is again my honor to tell the people of Mexico and other countries of Latin America about New China.

On behalf of the members of the Latin American Confederation of Labor—six and a half million working people—I extend my gratitude and admiration to the Chinese people.

I will now take back a gift from the Chinese people and workers—that is, their good example.

    我看到了新中国
    ——为《人民中国》创刊而作
    世界工联副主席  托列达诺
    我到中国来，怀着热切的愿望要亲眼看一看伟大的中国人民的大胜利，这个大胜利创造了中华人民共和国。自然，我渴望着能见到中国人民的领袖们，观察一下中国劳动人民、产业工人、农民、知识分子和青年的态度，他们正面对着建设一个强大、繁荣、独立和革命的新中国的巨大任务。
    我看到了那老百姓受剥削、充满了无知及道德上的奴役和悲戚的黑暗的冗长过去在死亡；而一个充满了活力、创造精神、社会主义、经济进展、民主教育和高度政治觉悟的新世界，在这里诞生了。
    我看到了土地改革普遍地实现在这个广大的国土上，为大多数人民的解放打下了基础。当人民大众的生活水准提高了，工业就能稳固地进步；这样，中国将永远地摆脱它的经济落后和贫困了。
    中国农民的反地主斗争，不但必然地将在亚洲其他各国，而且也会在拉丁美洲，引起广泛的反应。因为在我们拉丁美洲的许多国家中，仍旧存在着多少世纪以来的半封建结构。
    我看到了中国人民有史以来第一次享受了完全的自由；我看到了他们以极大的效率和喜悦在运用他们的政治权利。
    中华人民共和国是一个真正的民主国家；反对压迫者的人民民主专政，使得人民能够真正直接地参与政府、各种组织以及推动国家前进的一切事业。
    我看到了中国人民是在如何决心地在保卫他们祖国的主权，恢复中国的自主，永远地消灭外国帝国主义的侵扰和凶恶的影响。
    我看到了新中国如何的感到她和其他的民主国家，和苏联，和欧洲的人民民主国家，以及全世界的工人和进步势力互相紧密的联系在一起。
    我看到了中国的人民民主，在中国共产党领导之下，是如何成为一个达到社会主义国家和人类真正解放的桥梁。
    我也见到了毛泽东同志——这占了人类历史上光辉一页的伟大领袖，无论谁见到他，都不能不感到他有超乎常人的品质和他深刻的光芒四射的智慧；他有一个马克思理论家的、天才战略家的以及一个真正的领袖的头脑；他把他整个的身心都献给了人民的革命事业。这些品质使他能够和全世界无产阶级的领袖——斯大林——并肩站在全世界人民的先锋行列里面。
    在一九三五年，我曾把苏联普遍的介绍给我国广大的人民；那时只有少数人知道苏联的情形。现在，这又成了我的殊荣，来告诉墨西哥的人民和拉丁美洲其他国家的人民关于新中国的情形。
    我代表拉丁美洲总工会的会员——六百五十万劳动人民——向中国人民致感激和景仰之情。
    我现在将从中国人民和工人那里带回去一件礼物——那就是他们的好榜样。
