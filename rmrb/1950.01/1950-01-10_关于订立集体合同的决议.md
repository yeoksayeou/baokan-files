    Resolution on the Conclusion of Collective Contracts
    (Passed by the National Seamen's Union Representatives Meeting on December 26, 1949, and approved by the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on January 5, 1950)
    In public and private shipping enterprises, in accordance with the policy of "giving consideration to both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital," and the government's policy and plan for restoring and developing water transport, the seamen's unions and public shipping authorities and private shipping companies or trade associations shall, based on the principle of equality and voluntariness between the two parties, conclude collective contracts to ensure the material and cultural life of seamen, give play to the labor enthusiasm of seamen, eliminate unnecessary concerns of private shipowners in labor-capital relations, and boldly develop the shipping industry. To this end, the National Seamen's Union Representatives Meeting hereby makes the following resolutions:
    1. The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union shall promptly formulate and issue a propaganda outline on the reasons, purposes, contents, methods, and benefits of concluding collective contracts, as well as relevant reference materials on concluding collective contracts, in order to conduct propaganda and education work on concluding collective contracts among the broad masses of seamen. When necessary, local seamen's unions may specifically open short-term training classes for concluding collective contracts to train a group of backbone personnel who understand the meaning and methods of concluding collective contracts; and the Preparatory Committee and regional committees shall select key points to create typical experiences in concluding collective contracts to promote the progress of this work.
    2. Concluding collective contracts is one of the central contents of the current work of the seamen's union. It is stipulated that before the convening of the National Seamen's Union Representatives Meeting, the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union and the Maritime Affairs Bureau; the local seamen's unions and the local shipping companies or private shipping trade associations; and the purposefully selected one or two private shipping industry unions and local private shipping industry trade associations shall separately conclude collective contracts, at least drafting preliminary drafts, so as to summarize and exchange experiences at the representatives meeting.
    3. Under the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union and the local seamen's unions or preparatory committees, appoint capable cadres and establish a working department to guide the conclusion of collective contracts, responsible for leading this work. In the future, in the work reports of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the local seamen's unions to the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, the situation, results, and experiences of concluding collective contracts must be included as one of the main contents of the report.

    关于订立集体合同的决议
    （一九四九年十二月二十六日全国各地海员工会代表会议通过
    一九五○年一月五日中华全国总工会常务委员会扩大会议批准）
    在公私航运企业中根据“公私兼顾，劳资两利”的政策，与人民政府恢复与发展水上运输事业的方针、计划，由海员工会与公营航业机关与私营航业公司或同业公会，根据双方平等自愿的原则，订立集体合同，以保证海员的物质文化生活，发挥海员的劳动热忱，消除私营航业主在劳资关系上之不必要的顾虑，放手发展航运事业。为此，全国各地海员工会代表会议特作如下决议：
    一、由中国海员工会筹备委员会迅速制发关于订立集体合同的原因、目的、内容、办法及好处之宣传大纲，及有关订立集体合同的参考资料，以便在广大海员群众中进行关于订立集体合同的宣传教育工作，在必要时可由各地海员工会专门开办订立集体合同的短期训练班，训练一批懂得订立集体合同意义方法的骨干；并由筹备委员会及各地区委员会选择重点创造订立集体合同的典型经验，以推动这一工作之进行。
    二、订立集体合同为目前海员工会工作的中心内容之一。规定在召开全国海员工会代表大会以前，责成中国海员工会筹备委员会与航务总局；各地方海员工会与各地方轮船公司或私营航业同业公会；及有重点地选择一两个民船业工会与各地民船业同业公会分别订出集体合同，至少将初步草案拟出，以便在代表大会时总结交流经验。
    三、在中国海员工会筹备委员会及各地海员工会或筹备委员会之下，指定得力干部，设立指导订立集体合同的工作部门，负责领导这一工作。中国海员工会筹备委员会今后对全国总工会及各地海员工会对中国海员工会筹备委员会之工作报告中，必须将订立集体合同的情况、结果及经验作为报告主要内容之一。
