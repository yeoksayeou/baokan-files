    Yuci Fur Branch Expands Procurement of Fur from Various Regions for Export; Attention Still Needed Regarding Procurement Quality and Specifications
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to facilitate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and strengthen foreign trade, Yuci established the Yuci Fur Branch in October of last year to organize the export of fur and local products. The business has progressed well in the past three months. To facilitate procurement, the company successively established eight procurement teams in Jiaocheng, Fenyang, Liulin, Xinjiang, Wuzhai, Yuanping, Taiyuan, and Pingyao in Shanxi Province. In business, it tried its best to go through cooperatives and specialized companies. In three months, it absorbed more than 39,600 goat skins, more than 370,000 catties of spring combed wool and coarse and fine autumn wool, and more than 9,300 catties of purple velvet. At the same time, it supplied fur households with nearly 480,000 catties of food, nearly 3,800 bolts of foreign cloth of various colors, more than 90,000 chi of southern Hebei native cloth, more than 10,000 bolts of large-size native cloth, and more than 1,000 bolts of national cloth. When prices fluctuated in November last year, the company also cooperated with price stabilization work, selling more than 77,000 catties of food, as well as a large number of foreign cloth, sesame oil, cotton, and wood, etc. in one month. Therefore, it established prestige, making the procurement quantity in December twice that of the previous month.
    However, there are still some shortcomings in the current work, namely: the low technical level of business cadres and the weak sense of responsibility of individual cadres. As a result, some bad fur skins were received. For example, of the 1,000 skins transported back from Taiyuan, 100 were unusable. This must be overcome in the future to improve the quality of procurement and move towards standardization.

    榆次皮毛分公司广收各地皮毛出口
    尚须注意收购质量与规格
    【本报讯】榆次为了沟通城乡物资交流，加强对外贸易，组织皮毛土产出口，曾于去年十月间成立了榆次皮毛分公司，三个月来业务愿有进展。该公司为便于收购，曾先后在山西省设立了交城、汾阳、柳林、新绛、五寨、原平、太原、平遥八个收购小组，并在业务上尽量通过合作社及专业公司，三月来共吸收山羊板皮三万九千六百余张，春搔毛、粗细秋毛三十七万余斤，紫绒九千三百余斤。同时供给了皮毛户食粮近四十八万斤。各色洋布近三千八百匹，冀南土布九万余尺，大尺土布万余匹及国布千余匹。去年十一月物价波动时，该公司并配合稳价工作，一月售出食粮七万七千余斤及大批洋布、麻油、棉花、木料等。因此而树立了威信，使十二月收购数量比前月增加两倍。
    但目前工作中尚存在有若干缺点，即是：业务干部技术低和个别干部责任心不强。因而收到了些坏毛皮，如从太原运回的一千张皮子，即有一百张不能用。这在今后必须努力设法克服，以便提高收购质量，走向规格化。
