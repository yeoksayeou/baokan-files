    【Beijing News】The task of subscribing to public bonds by industrial and commercial circles, workers, troops, cultural and educational circles, government staff, women, and other sectors in the capital has been basically completed, and persuading subscription is underway in suburban areas and among wealthy households. The Beijing Municipal Public Bond Promotion Committee held a standing committee meeting yesterday (the 27th), where heads of various public bond promotion sub-committees reported on the promotion situation: The industrial and commercial sector has completed the original allocation task of subscribing to 1.7 million shares of public bonds, and cadres dispatched by the Municipal Public Bond Promotion Committee, the Municipal Government Finance and Economics Committee, the Commercial Bureau, and the Tax Bureau are working with the industrial and commercial sector’s public bond promotion sub-committee to assist various industries in conducting inspections and mobilization, rationally and specifically allocating, and urging payment, so as to ensure the smooth completion of the promotion work. The total number of subscriptions and actual purchases by workers, troops, cultural and educational circles, government staff, women, and other sectors has reached more than 300,000 shares. Industrial, commercial, and peddling sectors in the suburbs are still actively mobilizing and persuading subscription. Preliminary investigations have been conducted on wealthy households and retired civil and military officials, and mobilization and persuasion work will begin early next month. In terms of issuance by the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, a total of more than 340,000 shares were purchased by various sectors from the 5th to the 26th of this month. In order to avoid registration duplication in the number statistics, the Municipal Public Bond Promotion Committee also decided that the purchase of public bonds by government agencies, schools, women, parties, and various sectors should be based on the actual payment units and should not be reported repeatedly in order to accurately calculate the total promotion score.
