    Under the guidance of the Cominform resolution, the Party's task is to unite all democratic and patriotic forces and struggle against US imperialism and Syngman Rhee to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th] The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party held a plenary session last December. At the meeting on December 15th, Kim Il-sung gave a detailed report on the resolution of the Third Meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau (Cominform). Kim Il-sung first pointed out that the Cominform meeting's resolution provided our party with a new weapon. The Labor Party must implement the Cominform's resolutions in the context of Korea, and these resolutions determine the course of action for the working class and working people around the world. It is the party's combat task to deeply study the Cominform meeting's report and resolutions and relate them to the domestic situation in Korea in order to carry out our work. Kim Il-sung emphasized that under the guidance of the Cominform resolution, the tasks of the Korean Workers' Party are: first, to link the struggle for national independence with the struggle to defend peace, and to unite all democratic and patriotic forces, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, or party affiliation, broadly around the Fatherland Front, to fight against US imperialism and Syngman Rhee, and to strive for the general goal of peaceful reunification of the motherland. We must defeat the traitorous plan to launch a civil war and prevent US imperialism and its United Nations Commission from stepping onto our territory. Secondly, to further consolidate the strong military, political, and economic foundation of the Korean people—the democratic construction of North Korea. The Party should unite all the people around the Republic, strengthen the political education of cadres in the organs of power, and make them loyal servants of the motherland and the people; strengthen the organization and training of the People's Army, the Gendarmerie, and the Security Forces, and make all preparations to defend the motherland. The Party should mobilize party departments at all levels and all party members to take the lead in ensuring the victorious completion of the Two-Year People's Economic Plan. Party members must learn various technologies and production management methods.

    朝鲜劳动党举行中央全会
    金日成作重要报告
    在情报局决议的指针下，党的任务是：团结一切民主的爱国力量，为反对美帝及李承晚，为争取朝鲜和平统一而斗争。
    【新华社平壤六日电】朝鲜劳动党中央委员会去年十二月举行全会。金日成在十二月十五日的会议上，曾就共产党与工人党情报局第三次会议的决议，作了详细的报告。金日成首先指出：情报局会议的决议，使我们的党获得了新的武器。劳动党必须在朝鲜的情况下，执行情报局的决议，这些决议确定了工人阶级和全世界劳动人民的行动路线。而深刻研究情报局会议的报告和决议并联系朝鲜国内的形势，以开展我们的工作，是全党的战斗任务。金日成着重指出，在情报局决议的指针下，朝鲜劳动党的任务是：首先应将争取民族独立的斗争和保卫和平的斗争联系起来，将一切民主的爱国力量，不分政治见解、宗教信仰和党派关系，广泛地团结在祖国阵线的周围，为反对美帝国主义及李承晚而斗争，为争取祖国和平统一的总目标而斗争。我们必须击败卖国贼发动内战的计划，不让美帝国主义及其联合国委员会跨进我国领土一步。其次，要进一步巩固朝鲜人民强有力的军事、政治、经济的基础——北朝鲜的各种民主建设。党应将全体人民团结在共和国的周围，加强政权机关中干部的政治教育，使他们成为祖国和人民的忠实勤务员；加强人民军和警备队、保安队的组织和训练，作好一切准备，以捍卫祖国。党应当动员各级党部和全体党员带头，保证二年人民经济计划的胜利完成。党员必须学会各种技术和生产管理方法。
