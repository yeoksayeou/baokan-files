Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th - TASS Moscow dispatch: Saslavsky wrote an article in Pravda on the 15th, commenting on the Modena incident in Italy, entitled "Bloody Monday."

    Saslavsky wrote: On January 9, 1950, the police fired on a peaceful demonstration of workers in Modena. Among the dead were active fighters in the anti-fascist revolutionary movement during the Mussolini regime, who had fought in the guerrillas. At that time, they were able to avoid death under fascist bullets. But they were killed by bullets from Gasperi's "democratic" government.
            The Modena Incident Was a Premeditated Fascist Provocation
    Mosco, the mastermind behind this murder, was an active worker in Mussolini's fascist secret police. He is a butcher who has killed more than one honest Italian worker, and is currently the police chief of Modena.
    The bloody Monday in Modena was the result of a pre-arranged and carefully planned fascist provocation. Prior to the shooting, the Italian branch of Wall Street - the Italian Manufacturers Association - launched a reactionary movement. The chairman of the Manufacturers Association, Costa, on behalf of the capitalists, demanded that the government restrict the rights of trade unions in order to return the Italian working class to the situation under Mussolini. The Italian capitalists, with the support and encouragement of the American imperialists, incited the massacre of the working class who were fighting against the restoration of fascism in Italy. The capitalists of Modena turned from threats to action. The Modena foundry was closed, and the factory owners announced a lockout. The factory premises were occupied by the military police. Following this, the shooting of unarmed workers occurred.
    Due to the bloody Monday of the Italian workers, the "democracy" of the bourgeoisie has been nakedly exposed in its ugliness. Italian workers possess many rights that are expressly stipulated not to be arbitrarily violated. They possess the illusory "freedom of speech," while the military police exercise the real freedom to use bullets. The country is managed by a small number of people, confidants of Italian capitalists, who have sold their country to the American bosses. These bosses issue orders from New York: abolish all vestiges of "democracy" and restore fascism! The Italian subordinates are very willing to do their best, so the fascist Mosco jumped up and issued the order: "Aim at the workers - fire!"
    A wave of anger has gripped the working people of Italy. The funeral of the victims of Italian neo-fascism turned into a profound and moving demonstration attended by 300,000 people. At the graveside, many people delivered fiery speeches, calling on the workers to fight. General strikes occurred in several cities and spread from province to province. The anger of the Italian proletariat is immense. Bloody Monday will not be forgotten, and cannot be forgotten. The Italian reactionaries have aroused a force they cannot cope with.
            The "Democracy" of the Bourgeoisie is Just Shameless Deception
    The working people of Italy will learn a useful lesson from the Modena incident. This lesson tells us that where the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie manipulates power, democracy is only a myth, only a despicable story and shameless deception. Imperialism stifles all democracy of the working people, not even leaving a shred. The "democracy" of imperialism is a place for the unrestricted and brutal rule of the rich. Only where the capitalists have been removed from power, only where their arms have been disarmed, only where they no longer have the possibility of murdering workers, plotting conspiracies, and selling the country to foreigners, is it possible to realize true democracy and the power of the people.

    “血腥的星期一”
    真理报评摩登纳事件
    【新华社北京十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：萨斯拉夫斯基于十五日在真理报上撰文，评论意大利的摩登纳事件，题为《血腥的星期一》。
    萨斯拉夫斯基写道：在一九五○年一月九日，警察对准摩登纳工人的和平示威的行列射击。死者之中，有墨索里尼统治时代的反法西斯革命运动的积极战士，他们曾在游击队中进行过战斗。那时，他们能够在法西斯枪弹之下避免了死亡。但是，他们却被加斯贝利的“民主”政府的子弹杀死了。
            摩登纳事件是有准备的法西斯挑衅
    主使这次谋杀的墨斯柯，是墨索里尼的法西斯秘密警察的积极工作者。他是不只杀害过一个诚实的意大利工人的屠夫，目前是摩登纳的警察局长。
    摩登纳的血腥的星期一，是先期布置并筹划周详的法西斯挑衅的结果。在枪击事件发生以前，华尔街的意大利分支——意大利制造商联合会发动了反动运动。制造商联合会主席科斯塔曾代表资本家，要求政府对工会的权利加以限制，以便使意大利工人阶级回到墨索里尼时代的那种情况。意大利资本家获得美帝国主义者的支持和鼓舞，鼓动去屠杀为反对在意大利恢复法西斯政权而战的工人阶级。摩登纳的资本家自威胁而转至行动。摩登纳的铸造工厂关了门，厂主们宣布了拒雇。工厂的厂房被陆军警察占领。继之，即发生了枪击手无寸铁的工人的事件。
    由于意大利工人的血腥的星期一，资产阶级的“民主”，已经赤裸裸地暴露了它的丑态。意大利工人拥有许多明文规定不得随意破坏的权利。他们拥有幻想的“言论自由”，而陆军警察则在行使使用枪弹的真正自由。国家是由很少的几个人，意大利资本家的亲信人物所管理的，而资本家又已将其国家出卖给美国大老板了。这些大老板们自纽约发布命令：取消一切“民主”的遗迹，恢复法西斯主义！意大利的下属们非常愿意尽他们的能力来做，因此，法西斯分子墨斯柯就跳起来，发出命令：“瞄准工人们——放！”
    愤怒的浪潮已经紧紧地攫住了意大利的劳动人民，意大利新法西斯主义牺牲者的葬仪，变成了有三十万人参加的深刻动人的示威。在墓前，许多人发出了火样热烈的演说，号召工人战斗。总罢工在若干城市发生了，并且一省一省地扩展着。意大利无产阶级的愤怒是巨大的。血腥的星期一将不会被忘记，而且也不能被忘记。意大利反动派激起了它无法应付的力量。
            资产阶级的“民主”只是无耻欺骗
    意大利劳动人民将自摩登纳事件得到有益的教训。这个教训告诉我们，在资产阶级专政操纵大权的地方，民主只是神话，只是卑鄙的故事和无耻的欺骗而已。帝国主义扼杀了劳动人民的一切民主，连一点一滴也不剩下来。帝国主义的“民主”是富人无限制地残暴统治的场所。只有在资本家被除掉了权力的地方，只有在他们的武装已被解除的地方，只有在他们已不再有可能谋杀工人、制造阴谋和将国家出卖给外国人的地方，真正的民主和人民的权力才有可能实现。
