    Tai Gu Winter Study Develops Rapidly, Enters Consolidation and Improvement Stage
    It is required to appropriately combine with central work, overcome the phenomena of laissez-faire and coercion, and solve the problem of political lessons.
    [Reported by this newspaper] According to a report by the inspection team of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Education: The winter study movement in Tai Gu County, Shanxi Province, has moved from mobilization and enrollment to the stage of strengthening teaching efficiency, improving and consolidating. Land reform has been initially carried out in the rural areas of the county, and the winter study is being carried out very universally. A total of 257 winter study classes have been established, exceeding the original plan of 220. Of the 356 natural villages in the county, only 99 natural villages have not established winter study classes, all of which are small villages with fewer than 30 households. A total of 24,486 people regularly participate in winter study, accounting for two-thirds of all young and middle-aged people who should enter winter study, and slightly less than 22% of the county's total population (the county's total population is 112,426; young and middle-aged people are 37,101).
    Before the launch of the winter study movement, the county education department had made planned preparations, trained 137 volunteer teachers, and sent 18 cadres to form inspection teams to go deep into the three types of villages where land reform was in progress, where land reform was being completed, and where land reform had been completed, to learn from the experience of running winter study classes and promote the overall effort. After the winter study movement was launched, many activists emerged from the masses, party members, and cadres in various places. For example, Zhang Fengqi, a volunteer teacher in Pang Village, first investigated and studied the masses' understanding and attitude towards winter study after returning to the village from training, and then mobilized them door-to-door, first letting his daughters-in-law and sisters attend winter study, and promoting the smooth enrollment of women in the village. Village head Zhang Yu and Women's Federation Chairman Zhao Tingmei communicated with cadres at the village cadre meeting, explaining that work could only be done well if winter study was done well. All twelve cadres enrolled in winter study,带动 (dàidòng) 70 people to sign up for enrollment. Huo Lian, a communist party member and chairman of the Women's Federation of Jiajiabao, also served as the master of the village's textile group. Due to her leadership, all 30 women learning textiles enrolled in winter study. These activists played a significant role in the winter study movement in the new district. Many students are also very active in their studies. For example, in Xin Village and Chengjiazhuang, some students continue to study after class; some students feel that studying once every other day is too little time and request to change to daily study.

            Organize into Various Groups According to Farmers' Educational Level
    After the winter study classes started, various localities gradually improved the learning organization and adopted various methods to improve and consolidate the learning efficiency of the winter study classes. Some winter study classes held tests, and generally divided students into classes according to their educational level, and formed groups according to region and voluntary participation. For example, the winter study classes in Chengjiazhuang, Jiajiabao and other villages are divided into literacy groups, reading and writing groups, and current affairs research groups. Illiterates learn literacy; those with basic literacy learn writing and arithmetic; those who can read and write study current affairs and policies, correcting the simple method of "counting walnuts and dates alike" in the past. Villages such as Wujiabao and Chengjiazhuang expanded winter study and improved everyone's learning enthusiasm through cultural and recreational activities such as "Bayin" performances and Yangge dances. Villages such as Shixiang Village use public blackboards and broadcasting stations to promptly commend progress in winter study; at the same time, they hold various small meetings in a planned way (such as student parent meetings, mother-in-law meetings, and activist meetings) to solve various problems and make people feel at ease in their studies. In addition, some winter study classes democratically formulate covenants and establish systems, which become consciously observed disciplines; some winter study teachers and students formulate teaching plans and study plans to ensure that learning proceeds step by step.
    The current problems in winter study are: first, the leadership is still unable to properly combine winter study with the central work, especially at the county level, which is only busy with land reform and neglects the leadership of winter study. Some villages believe that land reform cannot be done if winter study is done. Second, cadres in the new district lack experience in running winter study, and the masses are not accustomed to attending winter study. Some village cadres emphasize form, thinking that only gathering together for the teacher to speak and the students to listen counts as schooling, and they do not adopt various forms to combine with the masses' production, thus making the masses feel that attending winter study has become a burden, thinking that they are attending school for the public. And there are two deviations: coercion and laissez-faire. Third, volunteer teachers cannot teach political lessons, do not know how to teach, or what to teach, and cannot meet the needs of the masses, so that some farmers are willing to take literacy classes but not political classes. How to strengthen the leadership of the district dissemination station and promptly impart political lesson content and teaching methods is an urgent problem to be solved.

### 太谷冬学发展迅速  进入巩固提高阶段

    太谷冬学发展迅速  进入巩固提高阶段
    要求适当结合中心工作，克服自流与强迫命令现象，解决政治课的讲授问题。
    【本报讯】据山西省教育厅视察组报导：山西省太谷县的冬学运动，已由动员入学进入加强教学效率、提高巩固阶段。该县农村已初步进行土地改革，冬学开展极普遍，共成立了冬学二百五十七座，超过了原定开办二百二十座的计划。全县三百五十六个自然村，仅九十九个自然村没有设冬学，都是三十户以下的小村庄。经常参加冬学学习的共二四、四八六名，占全部应入冬学青壮年的三分之二；占全县总人口的百分之二十二弱（全县总人口一一二、四二六人；青壮年三七、一○一人）。
    在冬学运动开展之前，县教育工作部门曾作有计划的准备，集训了义务教员一三七名，同时派干部十八人组织检查组，深入正在进行土地改革的、进行结束土地改革工作的和土地改革工作已经结束的三种类型的村庄，吸取开办冬学的经验，推动全面。冬学运动展开后，各地群众、党员、干部里涌现出不少积极分子：如庞村义务教员张逢祺，受训回村以后，首先调查、研究群众对冬学的认识与态度，然后挨门挨户进行动员，首先让自己的媳妇、姐妹上冬学，推动全村妇女顺利入学。村长张玉，妇联主席赵庭梅在村干部会议上打通干部思想，说明只有冬学搞好才能搞好工作，十二个干部全部入冬学，带动群众七十人报名入学。贾家堡妇联主席共产党员霍莲，兼任村纺织组的师父，由于她的带动，使三十名学习纺织的妇女全部入学。这些积极分子在新区冬学运动中起了很大作用，许多学员学习也很积极，如辛村、程家庄等地，有的学员下了课还继续学习；有的学员感到隔天学习一次时间太少，要求改为每日学习。
            按照农民文化水平  分别编成各种小组
    冬学开课之后，各地逐渐改进了学习组织，并采取各种方式提高巩固冬学的学习效率。有的冬学举行了测验，一般的都按学员文化程度分班，依地区及自愿编成小组。如程家庄、贾家堡等村冬学分为识字组、读写组、时事研究组。文盲学识字；粗通文字的学写算；能读会写的进行时事政策等的学习，改正了过去“核桃枣子一律数”的简单作法。武家堡、程家庄等村，通过“八音”会、秧歌等文娱活动，扩大了冬学又提高了大家的学习情绪。石像村等运用大众黑板、广播台及时表扬冬学中学习进步的；同时有计划地召开各种小会（如学员家长会、婆婆会、积极分子会）解决各种问题，使安心学习。此外，一部分冬学民主制定公约，确定制度，成为自觉遵守的纪律；有的冬学教师和学员订出教学计划和学习计划，保证学习按步就班地进行。
    目前冬学中存在的问题，第一，是领导方面还不能使冬学与中心工作适当结合，特别是县级只忙于土地改革而忽视了冬学的领导。有的村认为搞土地改革就不能搞冬学。第二，新区干部缺乏办冬学的经验，群众也没有上冬学的习惯。有的村干部强调形式，以为只有集中起来先生讲学生听才算上学，不会采用各种形式来结合群众的生产进行，因之使群众感到上冬学成了一种负担，以为是替公家上。而且产生强迫罚工或放任自流两种偏向。第三，义务教员讲不了政治课，不知道要怎样讲，讲些什么，不能满足群众的要求，使得有的农民愿上识字课而不愿上政治课。如何加强区传授站的领导，能及时的把政治课内容与教法传授下去，是急待解决的问题。
