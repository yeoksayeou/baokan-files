    “The Great Friendship”
    Jiang Ling

    A great friendship fills the world between the people of various countries who maintain peace and democracy. Their feelings are as harmonious as those of brothers and sisters. Within this harmonious feeling lies infinite strength and love, mutual assistance and encouragement without gaps, building a strong Great Wall together to defend against the attacks and sabotage of world imperialism against the democratic peace camp.

    The Soviet Union is the fortress of peace and democracy. Under the influence of this great spirit of the Soviet Union, the revolutionary struggles of various countries have received the leading force and assistance. The Soviet Union is inseparable from the victory of democratic revolutions in various countries. We can find this spirit everywhere in the sixth documentary "The Great Friendship" produced by the Beijing Film Studio.

    The Second World Democratic Youth Representative Conference opened in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. The youth representatives attending the meeting came from all over the world. There were young people from Asian countries such as the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Vietnam, and the Philippines, young people from various new democratic countries in Eastern Europe, and young people from countries such as Britain, the United States, and France. They have different languages ​​and races, but they all hold a common will and desire, that is, to stand under the banner of internationalism, to unite for the struggle for world peace, people's democracy, national independence, and the establishment of a better future, arm in arm, to fight resolutely against the imperialist reactionary camp to the end. Among international youth, the Soviet Union plays a leading role, and our representatives, thanks to the victory achieved by Chairman Mao's wise leadership, are universally respected internationally.

    The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly close. Look, how dear the people of the two countries are! When the Soviet Union was in Northeast China to expel Japan, how much blood did their soldiers shed and how many lives did they sacrifice! To help our construction cause, how many comrades have come to guide us. This is a manifestation of great class friendship and the exchange of cultural experiences. When the Soviet cultural workers came to China, it coincided with the founding of our People's Republic, which shows that the friendship between China and the Soviet Union will develop with the development of New China.

    After the Soviet cultural workers delegation returned home, another grand event in Beijing was the opening of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference. This is the first time that trade unions from Asia and Australia have gathered. In this meeting, we heard passionate speeches, frank reports, and detailed discussions. We saw solemn and warm scenes. The Soviet representative said: "In the Soviet Union, every worker is the master of his own country. They try to improve production, increase productivity, and rapidly improve the living standards of workers." The French representative said: "The French trade union will definitely firmly support Vietnam's national liberation war."

    In this film, we see the great unity of all peace-loving and democratic people in the world, we see the growth of the power of internationalists, and we see the international nature of the workers' class struggle. Our confidence in winning the victory in the struggle for people's democratic liberation is even firmer. At the same time, it also strengthens the confidence of progressive people all over the world in defending their motherland and striving for peace, democracy, and freedom, proving the inevitable victory and success of internationalism.

    “伟大的友谊”
    江岭
    伟大的友谊充溢在世界维护和平民主的各国人民之间，他们的感情融洽得好像兄弟姐妹一样。在这融洽的感情里，蕴藏着无限的力量和友爱，彼此互助鼓励无间，筑起了一条坚强的长城，共同防御世界帝国主义向民主和平阵营的进攻和破坏。
    苏联是和平民主的堡垒，在苏联的这种伟大精神影响之下，各国的革命斗争得到了主导力量和援助，苏联是与各国民主革命的胜利是分不开的。我们在北京电影制片厂第六号记录片“伟大的友谊”里，到处都能找到这种精神。
    世界民主青年第二次代表会议在匈牙利首都布达佩斯开幕了。与会的青年代表来自世界各国。有来自亚洲的苏联、中国、北朝鲜、越南、菲律宾等国的青年，有来自东欧各新民主主义国家的青年，有英美法等国的青年，他们有着不同的语言和种族，但是，他们都怀抱着一个共同的意志和愿望，那就是站在国际主义的旗帜下，为争取世界和平，人民民主，民族独立与建立美好的将来而团结在一起，臂膊挽着臂膊的向帝国主义反动阵营坚决的斗争到底。在国际青年之间，苏联起着领导作用，而我们的代表，也由于毛主席英明的领导所获的胜利，在国际间受着普遍的尊敬。
    中苏的友谊，是日益在紧密起来的。看吧，你看两国的人是多么的亲爱！当苏联在东北为了驱逐日本出中国去，他们的战士流了多少血，牺牲了多少生命！为了帮助我们的建设事业，又有多少同志来指导我们。这是伟大的阶级友爱的表现和文化经验的交流。当苏联文化工作者来到中国的时候，恰逢我们的人民共和国成立的时候，这又表明中苏两国的友谊，将随着新中国的发展而发展。
    在苏联文化工作者代表团回国之后，在北京的又一盛举是：亚澳工会会议的开幕。这是亚洲和澳洲的工会破题儿第一遭的大会师。我们在这个会议里，听到了激昂的演说，坦白的报告，周详的讨论。看到了严肃又热烈的场面。苏联的代表说：“在苏联，每一个工人都是自己祖国的主人，他们设法提高生产，使生产率增高，工人的生活水平迅速提高。”法国的代表则说：“法国的工会一定坚决支持越南的民族解放战争。”
    我们在这个影片里，看到全世界爱好民主和平人民的大团结，看到了国际主义者力量的壮大，看到了工人阶级斗争的国际性。对于争取人民民主解放斗争的胜利信心，更坚定了。并且同时也加强了全世界进步人民捍卫祖国，争取和平民主自由的信心，证明了国际主义的必胜和成功。
