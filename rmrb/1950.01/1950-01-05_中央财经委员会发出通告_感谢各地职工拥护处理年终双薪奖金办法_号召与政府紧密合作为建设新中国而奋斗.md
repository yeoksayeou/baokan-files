Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government issued a notice on the 3rd, thanking the workers of state-owned enterprises across the country for their enthusiastic support for the "Measures for Handling the Original Year-End Double Salaries or Bonuses of Certain State-Owned Enterprises" issued by the committee. The full text of the notice is as follows:

    Since the issuance of this committee's "Notice on Measures for Handling the Original Year-End Double Salaries or Bonuses of Certain State-Owned Enterprises," various regions and enterprises across the country have responded with telegrams, resolutely supporting the aforementioned measures and further requesting fewer bonuses, even requesting no bonuses, using their deserved bonuses to help the government overcome financial difficulties and invest in economic construction. Some units have even sworn to intensify their work and serve the people to respond to this call. All of this fully demonstrates the spirit of self-sacrifice of our working class, economizing on food and clothing, treating the public's difficulties as their own, bravely helping the country overcome the current temporary financial difficulties, and accelerating economic recovery work. It also fully proves that no matter what difficulties are encountered in all national economic construction departments, as long as we rely on all our employees, there is no problem that cannot be solved. As the New Year of 1950 approaches, we express our sincere gratitude to all employees of enterprises across the country and wish all employees close cooperation with us to strive for the construction of a new China!
                    Financial and Economic Committee of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government

    中央财经委员会发出通告
    感谢各地职工拥护处理年终双薪奖金办法
    号召与政府紧密合作为建设新中国而奋斗
    【新华社北京四日电】中央人民政府财政经济委员会于三日发出通告，感谢全国各地公营企业职工对于该委员会所发布的“关于某些公营企业原有年终双薪或奖金问题处理办法”所表示的热情拥护。通告全文如下：
    自本会“关于某些公营企业原有年终双薪或奖金问题处理办法”的通告发出后，全国各地区各企业单位纷纷来电响应，坚决拥护上述处理办法，并进一步要求少发奖金，甚至要求不发奖金，把他们应得的奖金来帮助政府克服财政困难，投资经济建设。有些单位更宣誓加紧工作，为人民服务，以响应这一号召。所有这些，都充分证明我国工人阶级自我牺牲的精神，节衣缩食，把公家的困难当作自己的困难，勇敢地帮助国家渡过当前的暂时的财政难关，加速经济恢复工作；也充分证明所有国家经济建设部门遇到了任何困难，只要依靠我全体职工，就没有解决不了的。当此一九五○年新年来临之际，特向全国各企业全体职工，表示我们的真诚的谢意，并预祝全体职工与我们紧密合作，为建设新中国而奋斗！
                    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会
                                    一九五○年一月三日
