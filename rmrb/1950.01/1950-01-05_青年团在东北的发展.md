The development of the Communist Youth League in the Northeast

Total membership in the Northeast region reaches 200,000

Over the past year, the work of the Communist Youth League in the Northeast region has achieved significant development under the correct leadership of the Party committees at all levels in the Northeast. A large number of outstanding young people have been absorbed into the League through various practical movements. League organizations have been widely established in factories, mines, railways, schools, and government agencies throughout the Northeast. Focused development has also begun in rural areas. According to incomplete statistics from available materials, nearly 200,000 members have been developed. Due to the active and leading role played by League members in production, study, and work, the prestige of the League among the masses has been greatly enhanced, making it the core for uniting and educating young people in factories, mines, railways, schools, government agencies, and rural areas, and a powerful assistant to the Party and government.

A large number of models emerge in industrial and mining production

In factories, mines, and railways, young workers, after joining the League, demonstrated high levels of enthusiasm for labor and were courageous and active in completing tasks. For example, the gas pocket (a waterlogged pocket) in the Changsheng Third District of the Jixi Coal Mine was the most difficult to work in. The pit leader sent people, but no one wanted to go. Several League members, including Fu Lian'di and Zhang Yongcai, volunteered to go despite the danger. While the administration stipulated producing nine carts of coal, they often exceeded the task by two or three carts. When the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Repair Plant was repairing the No. 2 blast furnace, workers completed the task twenty days ahead of schedule under the leadership of seven League members, collectively earning a special merit. Among the 7,000 members of the Communist Youth League on the Northeast Railway, 840 members received special merit, major merit, minor merit, or were selected as models in the months of April, May, and June. League members in the factories of Lüda (Dalian and Lushun), in the summary of the "Support the Party" competition in early September, saw the emergence of 225 production models. Zhao Guoyou, a League member of the Shenyang Machine Tool Factory No. 3, actively responded to the Party's call, reformed tools, and created a new record of machining a turret wheel in 1 minute and 16.5 seconds (and recently set a record of 50 minutes), becoming a promoter of creating new records in the Northeast. Liang Chaoxiang, a League member and driver of Locomotive No. 168 in the Locomotive Section of the China Changchun Railway, broke the highest record of towing 2,220 tons and reached 2,600 tons, receiving praise from the Party, government, and Soviet comrades, and was selected as a labor hero of Lüda industry. His locomotive was hailed as the "Youth Locomotive."

Since the Northeast Bureau called for the development of a mass movement to create new records, a large number of new record creators have emerged among the young League members in factories and mines in various regions over the past two months. Among the more than 6,000 young worker League members in Shenyang, more than 1,200 have created new records. In Jilin City, 225 League members created 230 new records in a month and a half. In Andong City, as of the end of November, 208 League members in 14 factories and enterprises had created new records, including 190 individual records and 40 collective records, with some creating six to eight records consecutively. The new records created include improvements and creations, waste recycling, increased production, and improved quality.

Apprentice League members actively take the lead and become the backbone of learning technology

In the record-breaking movement, apprentice League members actively learn technology and become the backbone of technical night schools and study classes. In many factories, under the leadership and promotion of League members, apprenticeship contracts have been widely established. In addition, they have also played a pioneering role in voluntary work, anti-waste campaigns, material contributions, factory protection, anti-espionage, and fire prevention.

Student League members in various schools have excellent academic performance

The Communist Youth League in schools has achieved results in uniting students to ensure good academic performance. For example, at Dalian University before the end-of-semester exams, in one class of the Medical School, the average score of 24 League members was 85 (the average score of 42 non-League members was 76). In November, League members in various municipal middle schools in Shenyang eliminated the phenomenon of failing grades. In addition, the Communist Youth League organized research societies, teacher-student forums, reports, Q&A sessions, recitations, story evenings, general knowledge quizzes, and mutual learning activities to assist in-class learning, strengthen teacher-student unity, and improve students' ideological awareness. Some schools, with the joint efforts of teachers and students and the leadership of League members, have created many new learning methods, collected and contributed various instruments and books (Changchun No. 2 Middle School collected more than 3,000 lost instruments), and used waste materials to make teaching aids, models, and specimens. For example, in Harbin No. 6 Middle School, under the guidance and help of teachers, the Communist Youth League and the Student Union organized research groups in physics, natural history, geography, and literature, creating many models and teaching aids. The physics research group alone produced 35 types of equipment, including diagrams of current conduction configurations, experimental devices for the principles of photography, and experimental devices for Archimedes' principle. During the summer vacation, under the leadership of the local Communist Youth League committees and student federations, cities such as Harbin, Dalian, Changchun, Shenyang, Jilin, Jinzhou, Siping, and Andong, in addition to organizing summer gardens and summer camps, also organized student volunteer labor construction teams to build parks, sports fields, river embankments, roads, and carry out campus construction, which not only cultivated students' labor concepts but also saved the country huge expenses. For example, the 9,000-strong youth labor team in Harbin saved more than 700 million in expenses in the work of repairing the sports field of the Martyrs' Park. When a typhoon struck Dalian, the Communist Youth League of various schools in Dalian responded to the call of the district Party committee, and under the leadership of the district Communist Youth League committee, organized a large number of students to participate in post-typhoon recovery work (such as protecting and rescuing public materials, fire prevention, anti-espionage, supporting trees, and pasting apple paper bags), and organized 200 people to work on the Changshan Islands.

Improvement of organizational systems in government agencies and improved work efficiency

The Communist Youth League in government agencies has played a certain role in completing the central administrative work, ensuring office learning systems, and enlivening the life of the agency. For example, in mid-November, the Yingkou Maritime Affairs Administration proposed salvaging the "Tongliao" tugboat, which had been sunk on the banks of the Liao River for five years, in order to build a wharf. The League members of the entire bureau immediately responded. After the tide receded in the middle of the night, everyone ran to the workplace three miles away. League members Jia Xiutang, Zhang Shufu, and several young staff members, regardless of the cold, took off their cotton clothes and jumped into the ship's hold, which was deep enough to submerge their abdomens, to drain water and dig mud, influencing many working comrades to participate in the work. After eight days and nights of labor by 60 people, a total of 350 tons of mud were dug, saving approximately 32 million (Northeast currency). The salvaged "Tongliao" was worth 4 billion, adding huge wealth to the country. Song Xiandi, Wu Baoyuan, and other League members of the bill review section of the Accounting Department of the Liaodong Provincial Taxation Bureau actively proposed reducing three complex and useless forms during the reorganization work, and improved work efficiency (for example, League member Wang Hongyu's review of bills increased from 500 to 1,800). Twelve of the 16 people in the section have been streamlined and dispatched to work in various counties.

Leading the vast number of farmers to actively produce and learn

In rural areas, wherever League organizations have been established, League members can generally actively take the lead in uniting the masses to participate in production. For example, during the summer hoeing season, League members in Shoude Village, Nehe, led the entire village to ensure three hoeings and three passes. On the ground they hoed, it was difficult to find even a grass thorn. League members also actively took the lead in organizing labor exchange groups. For example, 490 of the 545 rural League members in Lindian County participated in labor exchange and mutual aid groups (including 140 female League members), accounting for 91.7% of all League members. According to statistics from nine districts in Nehe, 90 of the 569 League members were selected as labor models and work models during the autumn harvest. Currently, the rural League organizations in various regions are actively mobilizing League members to take the lead in completing public grain tasks, organizing the vast number of young people to participate in sideline production and winter study movements, and developing League organizations in a guided and step-by-step manner around this central work.

Shortcomings in progress still need to be overcome

Over the past year, the work of the Communist Youth League has been successful. However, compared with the Party's heavy economic construction tasks and the demands of the vast number of young people, it is clearly still very weak. In the development of League members and League activities, due to the fact that some cadres underestimated the development of the situation and the progressive demands of young people's thinking under the victorious situation, and did not correctly grasp the League's policy, they excessively emphasized the League's progressiveness and neglected its mass character, thus producing a closed-doorist bias. In addition, the task of the League in factories and schools, namely production and learning, has not been implemented enough. Many places have not been able to closely integrate the central tasks to carry out League development and activities, which has somewhat affected the development and improvement of the League's work. The ideological education of the League is also insufficient. It has not been able to strengthen the education of young people inside and outside the League through various tasks along with the development of the League's organization, and gradually improve their ideological and political level. These shortcomings have been basically resolved since the National Communist Youth League Congress, especially after the Northeast Youth Workers' Work Conference and the Students' Work Conference were held in the second half of the year, but we still need to vigorously implement them to improve the work of the Communist Youth League in the Northeast.

    青年团在东北的发展
    东北全区团员发展至廿万人
    一年来，东北地区团的工作，在东北各级党委的正确领导下，获得了很大的发展。大批的青年优秀分子，在各种实际运动中被吸收到团里来，在全东北的工、矿、铁路、学校、机关中都已普遍地建立了团的组织，在农村中亦已开始有重点的发展，据现有材料不完全统计，已发展团员将近二十万人。由于团员在生产、学习、工作上发挥了积极带头的作用，大大提高了团在群众中的威信，成为工、矿、铁路、学校、机关、农村中团结教育青年的核心，党政的有力的助手。
    在工矿生产中涌现大批模范
    在工矿、铁路中，青年工人入团后，表现了高度的劳动热情，对完成任务是勇敢而积极的：如鸡西煤矿长生三区闷气掌子（是水掌子），最不好干，坑长派谁谁也不愿去，有傅连弟、张永财等几个团员，不怕危险自动要求去干，行政规定出九车煤，他们经常超过任务二、三车。鞍钢修缮厂修二高炉时，在七名团员带头下，工友们提前二十天完成了任务，集体立了特功。东北铁路七千名青年团员中，在四、五、六三个月中，团员立特功、大功、小功和当选为模范者，即有八四○名。旅大工厂团员，在九月初总结拥党竞赛时，即涌现出生产模范二百二十五名。沈阳机器三厂团员赵国有，积极响应了党的号召，改造了工具，创造了以一点十六分半钟车一个塔轮的新纪录（最近又创五十分钟纪录），而成为东北创造新纪录的推动者。中长铁路机务段一六八号司机团员梁超祥，突破了牵引量的最高纪录二千二百二十吨，而达到二千六百吨，受到了党政和苏联同志的表扬，被选为旅大工业劳动英雄；其驾驶的机车，被誉为青年号机车。
    自东北局号召开展群众性创造新纪录运动后，两个月来，在各地工矿青年团员中，已涌现出大批的新纪录创造者。沈阳市六千余名青工团员中，有一千二百余名创造了新纪录；吉林市一个半月内有二百二十五名团员，创造了二百三十件新纪录。安东市截至十一月底止，在十四个工厂企业中，有团员二○八人创造了新纪录，其中个人纪录一九○件，集体纪录四十件，内有连创六次至八次者。创造出来的新纪录，有改良创造，也有节约利用废物，有增加产量，也有提高质量。
            徒工团员积极带头成为学习技术骨干
    在创纪录运动中，徒工团员更积极学习技术，成为技术夜校、学习班里的骨干；在许多工厂中，在团员带头推动下，普遍订立了师徒合同。此外在义务献工、反浪费、献纳器材、护厂、防奸、防火等工作中，也都起了先锋作用。
            各校学生团员学习成绩优异
    学校中的青年团，在团结同学保证学好正课上，是有成绩的。如大连大学在前学期未考试时，医学院有一班，团员二四人平均得八五分（非团员四二人平均是七六分）；沈阳市各市立中学团员在十一月份消灭了功课不及格的现象。另外青年团并组织了研究会、师生座谈会、报告会、问答会、朗诵会、故事晚会、常识测验及学习互助等方式，以辅助课内学习，加强师生团结，和提高同学们的思想觉悟。有些学校，在师生共同动手动脑，团员带头保证下，创造了许多新的学习方法，搜集和献纳各种仪器书籍（长春二中搜集散失仪器即达三千余件），并利用废料，制作教学用具、模型、标本等。如哈市六中，在教员的指导帮助之下，青年团与学生会，组织了物理、博物、地理、文艺等钻研小组，创造出许多模型和教具；只物理钻研小组，就制作了大小三十五种，其中包括电流传导配置图、摄影原理试验器、阿基米德原理试验器等。在暑假期间，哈尔滨、大连、长春、沈阳、吉林、锦州、四平、安东等城市，在当地团委和学联的领导下，除组织了暑期学园、夏令营等活动外，并组织了学生义务劳动建设队，进行修建公园、运动场、河堤、马路，以及校内建设工作，不仅锻炼了同学们的劳动观点，并为国家节省了巨大的开支。如哈尔滨九千青年的劳动队，在修复烈士公园运动场的工作中，节省开支在七亿以上。当台风袭击大连时，大连各校青年团，即响应区党委号召，在区团委领导下，组织广大同学参加台风善后工作（如保护与抢救公家物资、防火、防特、扶树、糊苹果纸袋），并组织了两百人赴长山列岛工作。
            改善机关制度提高工作效率
    机关里的青年团，在完成行政中心工作，保证办公学习制度和活跃机关生活上，都起了一定的作用。如营口航政局在十一月中旬，行政上提出打捞沉没在辽河岸边五年的“通辽号”拖船，以便修建码头，全局青年团员立即响应。半夜里落潮后，大家跑到三里地以外的工作场所，青年团员贾修堂，张树福等和几个青年职员，不顾寒冷脱去棉衣，跳进水深没入腹部的船舱中排水挖泥，影响了很多工作同志一起参加工作。经过六十人八天的日夜劳动，共挖泥三百五十吨，约节省工资三千二百万（东北币下同）；打捞出来的“通辽号”，价值四十亿，为国家增加了巨大的财富。辽东省税务局会计科票照审核股团员宋献弟、吴宝元等，在整编工作中，积极提议减掉三种复杂无用的表格，并提高了工作效率（如团员王宏余审核票照竟由五百张增到一千八百张），全股十六人，已先后精简十二人，分别派往各县工作。
            带动广大农民积极生产学习
    在农村中，凡是已建立团的组织的地方，一般团员都能积极带头团结群众参加生产。如在夏锄时，讷河首德村的团员，带动全村保证三铲三趟，在他们铲过的地上，连草刺都很难找到。在组织换工组工作中，团员也是积极带头，如林甸县农村团员五四五名，参加换工互助组的有四九○名（内女团员一四○名），占全体团员百分之九一·七。据讷河九个区的统计，在秋收中，五六九名团员中有九十名被选为劳动模范、工作模范。目前各地农村团，正积极动员团员带头完成公粮任务，组织广大青年参加副业生产和冬学运动，并围绕这一中心工作，有领导有步骤地发展团的组织。
            前进中的缺点尚待继续克服
    过去一年来，团的工作是有成绩的。但若同党的繁重的经济建设任务，与广大青年的要求相比较，则显然仍是很薄弱的。在团员的发展和团的活动上，由于某些干部在思想上对形势的发展，和在胜利形势下青年思想的进步要求估计不足，没有正确掌握团的方针，过分的强调了团的进步性，而忽略了群众性，因而产生了关门主义偏向。另外是团在工厂、学校中的任务，就是生产和学习这一点尚贯彻得不够，很多地方还没能很好的紧紧的结合中心任务，进行团的发展和活动，以至多少影响了团的工作的开展和提高。团的思想教育也是不够的，没能伴随团在组织上的发展，通过各种工作加强对团内外青年的教育，逐步提高他们的思想政治水平。以上这些缺点，自全国团代大会后，特别是经过下半年先后召开东北青工工作会议和学生工作会议后，基本上虽已获得了解决，但尚须我们大力去贯彻，把东北团的工作提高一步。
