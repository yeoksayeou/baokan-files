Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: Warsaw, 9th (Polish Press Agency): *People's Tribune* (organ of the Polish United Workers' Party) further commented on the establishment of diplomatic relations between Britain and the People's Republic of China, stating: "Only a few months ago, British warships stood on the side of Chiang Kai-shek's army, interfering in the Yangtze River and obstructing the progress of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. But neither British military aid nor American military aid could stop the course of history, nor could they save the failure of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous government." *People's Tribune* concluded: "The British government's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China proves the bankruptcy of imperialist policy in China. For more than a hundred years, British imperialism has fought against the Chinese people, who were striving for freedom from the shackles of capitalism and colonial enslavement, and they have finally failed in this war. After years of conspiracy, bribery, and violence, British imperialism has been forced to admit that the Chinese people are the masters of their country."
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 11th: *L'Humanité* (French newspaper) published an article on the 6th by the famous French commentator Courtade, entitled "Recognition' and Others," commenting on the establishment of diplomatic relations between Britain and the People's Republic of China: "Experience proves that 'recognition' of a government established by a liberated people is only given when imperialist countries have no other way to go. This is a recognition of victory." The editorial pointed out: "Undoubtedly, Britain's rush to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China is to quickly occupy a position in trade with China. It also illustrates the fundamental change in the balance of power in favor of the democratic camp. Not long ago, when the British warship *Amethyst* deliberately sailed into the firing line of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the roar of the British lion was the same as in the triumphant era of the 'Opium War.' But they had to clean up the mess themselves. Old China is dead, and the new China is a growing country that is not afraid of threats. The lesson of the failure of this British provocation will make the people of all Eastern countries deeply realize that in the struggle for their complete liberation, they see China as an example to follow."

    论中英建立外交关系
    ——在多年的阴谋、收买、暴力之后，英帝已被迫承认中国人民是国家的主人。
    【新华社北京十一日电】波兰通讯社华沙九日讯：波兰人民论坛报（统一工人党机关报）再论英国与中华人民共和国建立外交关系称：仅仅在几个月以前，英国军舰就曾站在蒋介石军队一边，在长江进行干涉并阻碍中国人民解放军的进程。但是无论英国的军事援助还是美国的军事援助，都不能阻止历史的进程，都不能挽回蒋介石卖国政府的失败。人民论坛报最后称：英国政府决定与中华人民共和国建立外交关系，证明了帝国主义政策在中国的破产。一百多年以来，英国帝国主义与力图从资本主义和殖民地奴役的束缚下争取自由的中国人民作战，他们已最后在这个战争中失败了。在多年的阴谋、收买、暴力之后，英国帝国主义已被迫承认中国人民是国家的主人。
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】法国人道报六日发表法国著名评论家古尔塔达所作题为《“承认”及其他》的论文，评论英国与中华人民共和国建立外交关系称：“经验证明，对解放了的人民所成立的政府的“承认”，只是当帝国主义国家没有其他方法可行时才不得不给予的“承认”。这是对于胜利的承认”。社论指出：无可怀疑，英国抢先与中华人民共和国建立外交关系，是想在对华贸易中尽速占据地位。同时也说明了在力量对比上所产生的有利于民主阵营的根本改变。不久之前，当英国军舰“紫石英”号蓄意驶入中国人民解放军的炮火线时，大英狮子的叫嚣，曾和“鸦片战争”的得意时代一样。不过他们不得不自己收场。旧中国已经死亡，新中国已经是成长起来了的、不怕威胁的国家。英国这一挑衅行为失败的教训，将使所有东方国家的人民深深领悟：在为他们的彻底解放而斗争时，看到了中国是足以仿效的一个例子。
