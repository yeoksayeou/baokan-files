Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 22nd: The elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have focused the attention of the Soviet people on the most important issues of national policy. Moscow newspapers have been writing about the election campaign for days. *Izvestia* pointed out: The election campaign is increasingly becoming an important political school for millions of men and women workers, in which they can increasingly understand the full picture of the policies of the Party and the government, which are precisely the policies that create the vitality of the Soviet system. The Soviet people repeatedly examine the work they have done, gather their strength and possibilities from the viewpoint of the current tasks of the country, and discover new additional potentials for accelerating the development towards a communist society. *Izvestia* pointed out: The main thing that inspires the Soviet people and makes them full of unshakable confidence in victory is that they realize that our glorious Communist Party knows where to go and is victoriously advancing in this direction.

    An editorial in *Pravda* stated: In the struggle to build a communist society, the Soviet people are winning one victory after another. Soviet men and women clearly understand that all their victories are due to the wise leadership of the Communist Party and the great Stalin. The Party has been victorious and continues to win victories because it is united by unity of will, discipline and action, and has close ties with the millions of working masses, and because it is steadfastly loyal to the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism. The working men and women of our country believe that the Communist Party is the sole representative of their interests and aspirations. The people entrust their destiny to the Party, and the Party is fully justified in bearing the trust that the people place in it.

    苏联千百万男女劳动者通过选举了解政策
    选举运动已成为政治学校
    【新华社北京二十二日电】苏联最高苏维埃的选举，已把苏联人民的注意力集中到国家政策的最主要问题上。莫斯科各报连日的撰文论述这次选举运动。消息报指出：选举运动正日益变为千百万男女劳动者的越来越重要的政治学校，他们在选举运动中可以日益深刻地了解党和政府的政策的全貌，正是这些政策造成了苏维埃制度的活力。苏联人民再三地检查他们所作的工作，从全国当前任务的观点来聚集其力量和可能性，并发现加速向共产主义社会发展的新的额外的潜力。消息报指出：鼓舞着苏联人民并使他们对胜利充满不可动摇之信心的主要东西，就是他们意识到：我们光辉的共产党知道走向何处，并且正在胜利地向这一方向前进着。
    真理报的社论称：在进行建设共产主义社会的斗争中，苏联人民正赢得一个又一个的胜利。苏联男男女女都很清楚地了解，他们的一切胜利都归功于共产党和伟大斯大林的英明领导。党胜利了并且继续取得胜利，是因为它是为意志、纪律和行动的统一所团结着，并且与千百万劳动群众有着密切的联系，是因为它对马列主义的伟大学说矢志忠诚。我国的劳动男女认为共产党是他们的利益和愿望的唯一代表者。人民把他们的命运付托给党，而党是完全有理由承当得起人民对它的信托的。
