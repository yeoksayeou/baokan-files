    The Fire of the Prairie (Continued)
    By Our Correspondent in Shenyang, Tian Liu

    Technical Personnel Go Deep into the Field to Improve Labor Organization and Operating Methods.

    Influenced by Xu Hongwen and others, many enterprise management cadres and technical personnel in various mines and factories in Northeast China have stepped out of their offices and gone deep into the field. They have personally witnessed the selfless efforts and creative labor of the working class in building a great motherland, and they are deeply moved. They immediately joined the new record movement. On October 13th, the Party, government, and trade union cadres of Hegang Coal Mine jointly formed six groups to conduct experiments in the mine. By simply adjusting the labor organization and improving the operating methods slightly, the production efficiency immediately increased from 1.20 meters to 5.40 meters, producing nearly 6 billion yuan more wealth per month. Previously, cadres did not go deep into the field and did not understand how workers were producing, resulting in long-term obvious unreasonable labor organization and clumsy operating methods, causing a huge loss of 6 billion yuan per month. When leading cadres go deep into the field and begin to contact actual production, these problems are readily solved.

    Workers warmly welcome and sincerely love the cadres and technical personnel who go deep into the field to lead production. In early October, at the first Advanced Producers Conference of the Mechanical Bureau's Trade Union, all the representatives warmly welcomed the report from the workers of the Experimental Factory on their amazing experience of smelting 18.37 jin of iron with one jin of coke. The representative repeatedly requested that the conference invite the technician Shang Ke from the Experimental Factory to report, saying, "That is entirely due to Technician Shang's efforts." Technical personnel who truly go deep into the field and are touched by the heroic creative labor of workers will put the roles of both in the correct position. Shang Ke said, "This is mainly due to the efforts of the worker comrades. When the workers created a record of one to fourteen, surpassing the puppet Manchurian regime, I felt very strange and went to study it. I only improved it a little based on the theory on the basis of the workers' creation."

            Workers can create new records, and technical personnel can also create new records.

    Zhao Guoyou awakened the unprecedented enthusiasm of every worker to create new records, and Zhang Shangju organized this valuable enthusiasm to create a new collective record for the entire team, becoming the precursor to the "creating comprehensive new records for the entire factory" that thousands of factories in Northeast China are striving for. Deputy Manager Xu Hongwen and others, with vivid facts, answered those who thought "workers can create new records, but staff members cannot," and set a shining example for those who thought "they lack production knowledge and cannot lead the new record movement." Technical personnel going deep into the field, combining theory and experience, not only enriches the knowledge of technical personnel and transforms themselves, but also arouses the workers' desire for technical improvement, and arouses the workers' interest in and pursuit of culture and science—this is the key to building a strong modern industry for the motherland. Under the circumstances that objective conditions are already available, science and technology will determine everything. And comrades like Xu Hongwen and Shang Ke, with vivid facts, broke the conservative ideas left to the working class by Japanese invaders, Chiang bandits, and the old society, and are the prerequisite for guiding workers to obtain science and technology.

            Rushing Towards a New Climax

    The movement to create new production records is like a flood that has burst its banks, surging forward. It washes away the old dikes—puppet Manchurian standards, authoritative work evaluation, old organizational structures and labor organizations, inherited operating methods and management methods—galloping forward, creating its own new dikes—dikes that rush towards a new climax in economic construction.

    In the increasingly turbulent movement to create new production records, the liberated working class of Northeast China, in order to create new collective records for the entire factory, every worker, every production team, and every workshop are constantly improving operating methods, and establishing methods and systems of mutual connection, mutual inspection, and mutual assistance and cooperation. In the record-breaking movement, the workers of the No. 2 Power Plant of Benxi Coal and Iron Company check their machines every hour to ensure safe operation and power transmission. When the power transmission volume decreases, the power distribution workers immediately notify the pulverized coal machine workers to add less coal to the boiler, thus creating a new record of only using 0.77 kg of coal per kilowatt-hour (previously 1.1 kg). Now, the plant has successfully set various quotas on the basis of creating new records, carrying out planned quota production, and has implemented the "over-quota bonus wage system." When workers know that their income increases with their production improvement, they will produce more actively and enthusiastically. Anshan workers implemented a production record table, which detailed records of shifts, products, waste products, interruptions, idling, absenteeism, and responsible persons, etc. In order to complete the production tasks satisfactorily, the workers' sense of responsibility is highly developed. Shenyang Woolen Mill, Machinery Factory, and many other factories and mines have implemented workshop connection contracts—these are gradually formed and perfected in the movement to create new records, and are affirmed in the form of "work system," "labor record," and "connection contract," becoming the workers' own laws. Once the system is established, it is like a suitable dike that will make the river flow more smoothly, and in turn acts on production. It makes everyone's goals clear, responsibilities clear, and each workshop is tightly connected, providing a strong organizational guarantee for improving the overall productivity and creating new collective records for the entire factory.

            With the emergence of new records and the improvement of productivity, attention should be paid to timely adjusting labor organization, machine equipment, and corresponding production plans, etc.

    After Xu Hongwen, Deputy Manager of Benxi Coal and Iron Company, personally led engineering technicians to go deep into the tunnels to improve operating methods, making the tunnel excavation efficiency unprecedentedly improved, the original machine equipment and labor organization were no longer suitable for the needs of the new situation. The mine immediately reorganized the labor force, transferring more than 100 workers to other mines such as limestone mines, and the coal production increased from 2,300 tons per day to 3,000 tons. After Hegang Coal Mine adjusted its labor force, the excavation rate increased from 1.2 meters to 5.4 meters, which also caused new changes in machine equipment. In the past, it was felt that there were too many machines and they could not be used, so many machines had to be distributed and equipped, or simply left lying in the warehouse. Now, they must be concentrated, operated, and required to exert their maximum effectiveness. Shenyang No. 5 Machine Tool Factory, which achieved great success in the new record movement, conducted a comprehensive statistics on the utilization rate of machines in the factory on November 1, and found that in the past, 27.4% of the machines in the factory were idle in various postures without production: some were not repaired by the repair workers in time, some were idle due to production disconnects, and more machines were "waiting for materials" due to insufficient raw material supply! This statistic shocked the responsible cadres of the factory. They further realized that an excellent production leader should always pay attention to the changes in productivity and timely adjust the labor organization, improve machine equipment, and combine it with new production plans, new organizational structures, and sufficient and timely raw material supply.

    The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee pointed out in the "Decision on Launching the New Record Movement and Implementing Economic Accounting System" that the Party and trade union in the factory should "master professional knowledge, study and analyze all problems in production, without which there can be no practical political leadership." It also said: "If the economic accounting system cannot be implemented in a factory or mine, and the production plan cannot be completed, ... the Party and trade union there will bear serious political responsibility." All Party members and non-Party employees responded to the Party's call with practical actions. The raging fire of creating new records, like a prairie fire, was ignited by Party member Zhang Shangju and Communist Youth League member Zhao Guoyou. Comrade Zhang Lie of the Fushun Municipal Party Committee told reporters when describing the new record movement that had achieved success in the city's coal mines: "The first battle was fought against ourselves." Before the movement began, they overcame the idea that "coal mines cannot engage in record-breaking movements" with unprecedented fierce debates, and went deep into the workers with trade union cadres to assist the administration in launching the new record movement, and achieved great success. Comrade Luan Binghe, director of the trade union of Andong City Machinery Factory, went deep into the workshop in the record-breaking movement, helped the workers design and improve tools, and led the transformation of fitters to complete professional division of labor, realizing the responsibility system. His work method of getting rid of formalism in trade union work and facing production has attracted the attention of the Liaodong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and called on trade union workers throughout the province to learn from him. All Party and trade union cadres who face production, go deep into the workshop, and directly lead the movement to create new records have created many effective working methods in practice. Xiuyan Lead Mine universally implemented the "red and black dot movement." Workers and groups who exceeded the task were marked with red dots, those who completed the task were marked with yellow dots, and those who failed to complete the task were marked with black dots. The results were registered and announced every day, and summarized at the end of the month. The workers strived to be marked with red dots and were unwilling to "take the blame." The railway system implemented the mobile red flag competition; Fushun's mines and factories and the "May 3rd" Factory and others used production teams, night schools, and other organizations to hold new record symposiums and lectures; Anshan implemented "worker reception day" on Saturday afternoons, etc., all effectively promoting the rapid advancement of the movement to create new production records. At the same time, because cadres went deep into the workers and workshops, understood the production process, and learned production knowledge and management knowledge, they were able to discover problems in time, give appropriate solutions, and seize the most important link to give symptomatic improvements, making the work of the entire enterprise leap forward. For example, after the new record movement in Shenyang No. 5 Machine Tool Factory was launched enthusiastically, advanced producers worked with amazing efficiency. Machine tool workers jointly wrote a letter to the factory director, asking for tasks, and scribers also guaranteed how many jobs they could do. This shows that the castings of the foundry section could not be supplied. The leadership seized this link, mobilized Party members and Communist Youth League members to take the lead in launching a competition, and improved the labor organization of the foundry section and established a connection contract. The work of the foundry section immediately improved and closely cooperated with the movement to create new production records throughout the factory.

    When the workers' production enthusiasm and creative wisdom are encouraged, supported, and led by the factory Party, administration, trade union, and engineers and technicians, the movement to create new production records will move forward more vigorously; when leading cadres summarize the experiences of advanced producers, set them as systems, spread them, and persist in them, the movement will develop more steadily and rapidly and spread to every corner; using various methods to consolidate the new records of advanced producers, and on the basis of the majority of workers' technology has been improved to determine the "quota", as well as the corresponding adjustment of labor organization, improve machine equipment conditions, implement over-quota bonus wage system, it will make the movement to create new production records to a higher stage - all this is destined to cause a new upsurge in Northeast industrial construction, the liberated Northeast working class is accelerating to this new upsurge of economic construction under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government.

    燎原的火焰（续完）
    本报驻沈记者  田流
    技术人员深入现场，改善劳动组织与操作方法。
    东北各矿厂许多企业管理干部和技术人员在徐宏文他们影响之下，纷纷从办公室走出来，深入到现场中。他们亲眼看到工人阶级为建设伟大祖国所作的忘我努力和创造性的劳动，都深受感动，他们也立即卷入新纪录运动中。十月十三日鹤岗煤矿党、政、工会干部联合组成六个小组深入矿井试验，仅仅稍微调整了一下劳动组织，改善了一点操作方法，生产效率立时由一·二○米提高到五·四○米，每月多生产财富近六○亿元。以前干部不深入现场，不了解工人是怎样生产的，以致长期的存在着显而易见的劳动组织的不合理和操作方法上的拙笨，造成每月无形中浪费六○亿元的巨大损失，当领导干部深入现场，开始和实际生产接触时，这些问题便迎刃而解了。
    工人们对深入现场领导生产的干部和技术人员，给以热烈的欢迎和衷心的爱戴。十月初旬，在机械局总工会第一届先进生产者大会上，全体代表热烈欢迎实验工厂工友报告他们用一斤焦炭化十八·三七斤铁的惊人经验，该代表一再请求大会应请实验工厂的技术员尚可报告，他说“那完全是尚技术员的功劳”——真正深入现场，感触到工人英勇的创造性劳动的技术人员，会把两者的作用放到正确的位置上，尚可说：“这主要是工人同志们的功劳，当工人创造出一比十四的超过伪满的纪录时，我感到很奇怪，才去研究，我不过根据理论在工人创造的基础上，又把它改进一点罢了。”
            工人能创造新纪录，技术人员也能创造新纪录。
    赵国有唤起每个工友创造新纪录的空前热情，张尚举又把这种宝贵的热情组织起来，创造全组集体的新纪录，成为全东北千百个工厂全力追求的“创造综合性的全厂新纪录”的先声。徐宏文副经理等又以生动的事实回答了那些认为“工人能创新纪录，职员不能创新纪录”的人，给那些认为“自己缺乏生产知识，不能领导新纪录运动”的人作出了光辉的榜样。技术人员深入现场，以理论和经验相结合，不仅丰富着技术人员的知识和改造着自己，更引起了工人对技术改进的渴望，引起了工人对文化科学的兴趣和追求——这是建设祖国强大的现代工业的关键，在客观条件已经具备的情况下，科学技术将是决定一切的。而徐宏文、尚可等同志用生动的事实，打破日寇、蒋匪和旧社会遗留给工人阶级的保守思想，又是引导工人获得科学技术的先决条件。
            奔向新的高潮
    创造生产新纪录运动如决堤洪流，汹涌奔腾。它冲毁条条旧的堤岸——伪满标准、权威估工，旧的组织机构和劳动组织，因袭的操作方法和管理方法——奔驰向前，创造着新的自己的堤岸——奔向经济建设新高潮的堤岸。
    在愈来愈汹涌澎湃的创造生产新纪录运动中，解放了的东北工人阶级，为着创造全厂集体的新纪录，每个工人、每个生产组、每个车间，都不断的改进着操作方法，并建立起互相连系、互相检查和互相帮助配合的方法与制度。本溪煤铁公司第二发电厂在创纪录运动中，发电机工人每点钟都要检查一下自己的机器，保证了安全运转和送电，配电工人当送电量减少时，马上通知粉煤机工人少给锅炉添煤，因此创造了一个电字（Ｋ．Ｗ．Ｈ．）仅用○·七七公斤煤的新纪录（过去为一·一公斤），现该场已在创造新纪录的基础上顺利地定出各种定额，进行有计划的定额生产，并已实行“超额奖励工资制”，当工人们知道他的收入是随着自己的生产提高而增加时，他就更加积极热情的生产了。鞍山工人实行了生产纪录表，将交班、产品、废品、中断、空转、欠勤及负责人等等都详细纪载，为了完满地完成生产任务，工人的责任心高度发挥出来。沈阳毛织厂、机械厂以及许多别的工厂矿山，都实行车间连系合同——这些都在创造新纪录运动中逐渐形成，逐渐完备，并以“工作制度”、“劳动纪录”、“联系合同”等形式肯定下来，成为工人自己的法律。制度既经确定，它就像适宜的堤岸会使河水流得更顺畅，又反转来作用于生产了，它使人人目标明确、职责分明，各车间紧紧衔接起来，给提高整个生产力创造全厂集体新纪录作了强力的组织保证。
            随着新纪录的出现，和生产力的提高，应注意及时调整劳动组织
        、机器设备以及相适应的生产计划等等。
    本溪煤铁公司副经理徐宏文亲自领导工程技术人员深入坑道改进操作法，使坑道掘进效率空前提高后，原来的机器设备与劳动组织就不适合新情况的需要了，该矿立时重新组织劳动力，调出一百多名工友转入石灰石等其他矿井工作，煤产量反而由日产二三○○吨提高到三○○○吨；鹤岗煤矿调整劳动力后掘进率由一·二米提高到五·四米，因此也引起了机器设备方面的新变化，过去感到机器多，用不了，只好让许多机器分散配备，或干脆就让它们躺在仓库里，现在就必须把它们集中起来，运转起来并要求发挥它们最大的效能。新纪录运动获得巨大成绩的沈阳第五机器厂，十一月一日对本厂机器的运用率作过一次全面的统计，发现过去全厂有百分之二七·四的机器，以各种各样的姿态在那里呆着没有生产：有的是修理工人没有及时修理好、有的因生产不衔接在那里空闲着，有更多的机器因原料供给不上在“停工待料”！这一统计使该厂负责干部大吃一惊，他们进一步体会到：一个优秀的生产领导者，应该随时注意生产力的变化而及时的调整劳动组织，改善机器设备，以及和它相适应的新的生产计划、新的组织机构和充分及时的原料供应等等方面的结合。
    中共中央东北局在“关于开展新纪录运动贯彻经济核算制决定”中指出，工厂党及工会应该“掌握业务知识，钻研与分析生产中的一切问题，没有这一点就不可能有实际的政治领导”。又说：“那个厂矿企业内经济核算制不能贯彻，生产计划不能完成，……那里的党与工会就要在政治上负严重的责任。”全体党员和非党的职工用实际行动响应了党的号召，势如燎原的创造新纪录的烈火，就是党员张尚举、团员赵国有点燃起来的，抚顺市委张烈同志向记者叙述该市各煤矿已获成效的新纪录运动时说：“第一仗是向我们自己开的”。在运动开始之前，他们用空前激烈的争辩克服了“煤矿不能搞创纪录运动”的思想，和工会干部一起，深入工人去协助行政开展新纪录运动，并使之获得巨大成绩。安东市机械工厂工会主任栾秉和同志在创纪录中深入车间，帮助工友设计改进工具，领导钳工完成专业分工的转变，实现了专责制，他这种摆脱工会工作中的形式主义作风，面向生产的工作方法，已引起辽东省总工会的重视，并号召全省工会工作者向他学习。所有面向生产，深入车间、直接领导创造新纪录运动的党与工会干部，在实际中创造了好多有效的工作方法。岫岩铅矿普遍实行了“红黑点运动”，超过任务的工人和小组记红点，完成任务的记黄点，完不成任务的记黑点，每天登记公布，月底总结，工友们都争取记红点，不愿“背黑锅”；铁路系统中实行了流动红旗竞赛；抚顺各矿厂和“五三”工厂等利用生产小组、夜校等组织开新纪录座谈会、讲演会；鞍山星期六下午实行“接见工人日”等等，都有效的推动着创造生产新纪录运动迅速前进。同时由于干部深入工人和车间，了解了生产过程，学习到生产知识与管理知识，便能够及时发现问题，给予恰当的解决，便能够抓住那最主要的环节给予对症下药的改进，使整个企业的工作突飞猛进。如沈阳五机械厂新纪录运动热烈开展后，先进生产者用惊人的效率工作着，机床工人联名上书，向厂长要任务，划线工人也保证有多少活便能划出多少活，这说明着翻砂股的铸件供不上，领导上便抓住了这一环，动员党员团员带头发起竞赛，又改善了翻砂股的劳动组织，建立起联系合同，翻砂股工作马上就有了起色，与全厂创造生产新纪录运动紧密配合起来了。
    当工人的生产热情和创造性的智慧得到工厂党、行政、工会及工程师技师们的鼓励、支持和领导之后，创造生产新纪录运动就更加汹涌前进了；当领导干部深入现场，将先进生产者的经验总结起来，定为制度传播开去坚持下来的时候，运动便更加稳健地迅速地发展起来，并普遍到各个角落了；用各种方法将先进生产者的新纪录巩固下来，并在多数工人技术已经提高的基础上确定“定额”，以及和它相适应的调整劳动组织，改善机器配备状况，实行超额奖励工资制，就会使创造生产新纪录运动走上更高的阶段——这一切是注定了要引起东北工业建设的新高潮的，解放了的东北工人阶级在党与人民政府领导下，正在加速的奔向这一经济建设的新高潮。
