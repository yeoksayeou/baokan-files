Xinhua News Agency, Gui Sui, 3rd. The CCP Suiyuan Provincial Committee, Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, and Suiyuan Military Region, having moved from Fengzhen to Gui Sui, held a tea party on December 19th of last year at the CCP Suiyuan Provincial Committee's location in Gui Sui. They gathered with over 70 people, including leaders and members of the local Military and Administrative Committee and the Provincial People's Government, senior military and government cadres, representatives of Mongolian and Hui nationalities, figures from the cultural and educational sectors, and local gentry.

At the meeting, Gao Kelin, Secretary of the CCP Suiyuan Provincial Committee, delivered a speech first. He initially emphasized the importance of unity and, on behalf of the CCP Suiyuan Provincial Committee, affirmed that unity would certainly be achieved. However, he also pointed out that certain difficulties would arise during cooperation because the two sides were still in a state of opposition a year ago. There is still insufficient understanding between everyone, and there will be some differences in living habits, work styles, and even perspectives on issues. At the same time, among the comrades who came from Sui East, there are Communist Party members and non-Communist Party members, and many comrades are from various provinces and regions in North China. This requires everyone to study Mao Zedong Thought diligently, use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, be strict with oneself and lenient with others, proceed from unity, and achieve the goal of unity through mutual criticism.

Chairman of the Provincial Government, Dong Qiwu, in his speech, besides introducing the achievements of the past three months since the "September 19th" Uprising, based on Chairman Mao's instructions on building a new Suiyuan, including reforming thinking, launching a study movement, arresting secret agents, and implementing production and construction policies, he also pointed out that one of the reasons for the limited success was the lack of direct leadership from the Communist Party in practice. He said: "From today onwards, with the direct leadership of the Communist Party, resolutely implementing the Common Program, and practicing the people's democratic dictatorship, I believe that all the people of Suiyuan, all nationalities, and all cadres will definitely be able to unite closely and strive to build a new Suiyuan for the people."

Rong Xiang, a member of the Suiyuan Military and Administrative Committee, in his speech, particularly affirmed his confidence in unity. Sun Lanfeng, Vice Chairman of the Provincial Government, in his speech, narrated the moving examples of him seeing Chairman Mao and the Communist Party sincerely uniting with various democratic parties and democratic figures from all walks of life when he went to Beijing to participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and expressed his confidence in completing the glorious task of building a new Suiyuan under the leadership of the CCP Suiyuan Provincial Committee.

Wu Tong (former Director of the Suiyuan Provincial Hui Friends Association), a Hui representative, in his speech, especially criticized the Kuomintang bandit gang for denying that the Hui nationality is a nation, which is absurd. Liu Wanchun, a member of the Military and Administrative Committee, emphasized that it is not only necessary to unite and progress, but also to do a good job and quickly transform the uprising army into the People's Liberation Army, making it a strong national defense force.

Li Zhizheng and Yang Lingde, members of the Provincial Government, and Wang Kejun and Zhang Qin, members of the Military and Administrative Committee, then spoke, unanimously pointing out that it is necessary to unite and progress.

    学习毛主席思想，团结进步
    为建设新绥远而奋斗
    中共绥远省委、绥远省人民政府等举行茶话会一致表示
    【新华社归绥三日电】由丰镇移驻归绥的中共绥远省委员会、绥远省人民政府、绥远军区于去年十二月十九日在归绥中共绥远省委驻地举行茶话会，与当地军政委员会和省人民政府各首长、委员，军政高级干部，蒙回民族代表，文化教育界及当地士绅等七十余人联欢。会上首由中共绥远省委书记高克林致词。他首先指出团结的重要性，并代表中共绥远省委肯定表示一定能团结好。但他同时又指出，在合作中也会发生某些困难，因为一年前双方还是在对立的状态中，现在大家相互之间还不够了解，在生活习惯上，工作作风上，以至对问题的看法上，也都会有些不同。同时，在绥东来的同志中，有共产党员，也有非共产党员，其中还有许多同志是来自华北各个省区的。这就需要大家好好学习毛主席的思想，用批评和自我批评的武器，责己严，责人宽，从团结出发，经过互相批评，达到团结之目的。省府主席董其武在讲话中除介绍“九一九”起义至今三个月来，根据毛主席对建设新绥远的指示，改造思想，开展学习运动，逮捕特务，实行生产建设政策的成绩外，并指出收获不大的原因之一，是尚未在实际上得到共产党的直接领导。他说：“从今天起，有了共产党的直接领导，坚决执行共同纲领，实行民主专政，我相信全绥远人民、各民族、全体干部一定能够亲密团结起来，为建设人民的新绥远而奋斗。”绥远军政委员会委员荣祥在讲话中，特别肯定表示他对团结的信心。省府副主席孙兰峰讲话时，叙述了他到北京参加人民政协见到毛主席、共产党真诚地团结各民主党派和各界民主人士的动人实例，并表示在中共绥远省委的领导下，有信心完成建设新绥远的光荣任务。回族人士吴桐（原绥远省回友协会理事长）在讲话中特别指斥国民党匪帮否认回族是一个民族的荒谬。军政委员会委员刘万春强调提出：不仅要团结进步，还必须搞好工作，迅速把起义军队解放军化，使它成为一支坚强的国防军。省政府委员李芷政、杨令德，军政委员会委员王克俊、张钦等接着都讲了话，一致指出要团结进步。
