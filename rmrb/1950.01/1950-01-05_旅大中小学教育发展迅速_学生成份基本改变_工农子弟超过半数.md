Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 3rd: Primary and secondary education in the Lushun-Dalian area has developed greatly in the past year. The composition of students has fundamentally changed, with children of workers and peasants accounting for more than half. The district now has nine middle schools (including one normal school), 279 teachers, and 6,577 students, an increase of one middle school, 60 teachers, and 2,457 students compared to 1948. There are a total of 527 primary schools, 3,773 teachers, and 147,510 students, an increase of 197 schools, 1,380 teachers, and 63,431 students compared to 1948. According to the Lushun-Dalian area's two-year economic construction plan for 1949-1950, the number of primary schools added last year has exceeded more than one-half of the total plan, giving 62,000 out-of-school children in the region the opportunity to study. The enrollment rate of school-age children has reached more than 85%. In terms of student family composition, students from worker and peasant backgrounds account for 51% of middle school students, and children of workers account for approximately 64.7% of primary school students, basically meeting the requirements put forward in the two-year plan.

Over the past year, the quality of teachers and students in various schools has also generally improved. Last year, middle schools twice recruited 114 teachers from other areas in a planned manner, and 1,349 new primary school teachers were hired through examinations. While improving the teaching staff, attention was also paid to strengthening the learning of in-service teachers, especially the organized and planned study of advanced Soviet teaching experiences. Over the past year, 1,077 primary school teachers have participated in normal school classes, teacher training classes, and educational research associations. In addition, large classes, amateur cultural tutoring classes for primary school teachers, and teaching research associations for various subjects have been used to strengthen the learning of primary school teachers. The quality of teachers has gradually improved. As a result, student performance has also greatly improved, especially in primary schools. According to incomplete statistics, the grades in all subjects in September and October last year exceeded those of the first half of the year. However, the important task of primary and secondary education in Lushun-Dalian at present is still to improve the teaching staff, especially the need to strengthen the learning of middle school teachers. In addition, student health work in various schools is also not sound, and absenteeism due to illness is still common. Therefore, schools will try to enrich school health and healthcare facilities this year.

    旅大中小学教育发展迅速
    学生成份基本改变
    工农子弟超过半数
    【新华社大连三日电】旅大地区的中小学教育一年来获得很大发展，学生成份已基本改变，工农子弟超过半数。该区现有中学九所（包括师范一所）、教师二百七十九名、学生六千五百七十七名，较一九四八年增加了中学一所、教师六十名、学生二千四百五十七名。小学共有五百二十七所、教师三千七百七十三名、学生十四万七千五百一十名，较一九四八年增加学校一百九十七所、教师一千三百八十名、学生六万三千四百三十一人。按照旅大地区一九四九至一九五○年的两年经济建设计划规定，去年增设小学数目已超过全部计划的二分之一以上，使全区六万二千名失学儿童有了求学的机会。现学龄儿童的就学率已达百分之八十五以上。学生家庭成份，中学生工农出身者已占百分之五十一，小学内工人子弟约占百分之六十四点七，基本上达到两年计划中提出的要求。一年来，各校教师、学生的质量亦已普遍提高。中学去年曾两次有计划地向外地招聘教师一百一十四名，小学教师亦改由考试方式新任用了一千三百四十九名。在提高师资中同时注意加强在职教师的学习，特别是有组织、有计划地学习苏联先进的教学经验。一年来，小学教师参加师范班、师训班、教育研究会等学习者达一千零七十七人。此外，并利用上大课、组织小学教师业余文化补习班及各科教学研究会等加强小学教师学习。教师质量逐渐提高。学生成绩因之亦大有进步，尤以小学更为显著。据不完全统计，去年九、十两月各科成绩均已超过了上半年。但旅大中小学教育工作目前的重要任务仍是提高师资，特别是中学教师的学习需要加强。此外，各校学生保健工作亦不健全，因病缺课的现象仍普遍存在，故今年各校将尽可能充实学校卫生和保健的设备。
