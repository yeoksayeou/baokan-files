Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th. Polish, British, and Swedish progressive newspapers commented on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Britain. According to a Warsaw dispatch from the Polish Press Agency: The Polish *People's Tribune* (organ of the United Workers' Party) published a commentary on the 7th stating: "The British ruling groups have had to recognize the existence and consolidation of the People's Republic of China as an ironclad fact, and one that cannot be altered by wishful thinking. Britain's recognition of a powerful nation like People's China stems primarily from Britain's own interests." *Republic* (organ of the Polish government) published a commentary titled "Six Years – Ninety-Eight Days," comparing the time it took Britain to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1924 with the time it took to announce the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. The newspaper pointed out that the contrast between these two time periods reflects the enormous changes that have taken place in the world since the Great October Revolution.

The British *Daily Worker* says that to bring real benefits to the Chinese and British people, Sino-British trade must be developed.

According to news from London: The British *Daily Worker* published an editorial on the 7th entitled "China – What Next?" pointing out that Britain's establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China is a recognition of the undoubtedly victorious people's revolution on the largest territory in Asia, and a belated recognition at that. But this is only a beginning. To bring real benefits to the British and Chinese people, it must be followed by a large-scale development of trade. The editorial continued: The capitalist groups in the United States are supporting the remnants of the Chinese reactionaries in Taiwan, and weapons and equipment are being rushed to Taiwan so that they can continue to organize the so-called blockade of China, which will be one of the tests of the British government's sincerity.

Swedish Communist organ urges the establishment of Sino-Swedish diplomatic relations.

According to a dispatch from Copenhagen by Teletype Agency on the 9th: The Swedish Communist Party organ *New Era* published an editorial on the establishment of diplomatic relations between Britain and the People's Republic of China, stating that this shows that British imperialists are now calculating the possibility of doing business with this huge country. The editorial continued: "Chiang Kai-shek's representatives still occupy seats in the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council." "This provocative attitude towards the Chinese people can no longer be tolerated. It is indeed a painful thing for the imperialist countries to be forced to allow the people's representatives to participate in the Security Council." The editorial concluded by strongly urging Sweden to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, saying: "Sweden should not be the last in line in deciding whether to recognize the fact that the people have liberated themselves from domestic and foreign oppressors."

### 波兰报纸评论  英国是从本身利益出发的

    波兰报纸评论
    英国是从本身利益出发的
    【新华社北京十日电】波兰、英国、瑞典的进步报纸评论中英两国建立外交关系。据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰人民论坛报（统一工人党机关报）七日发表评论称：“英国的统治集团已经不得不承认中华人民共和国的存在和巩固，是一件铁的事实，而且不是一相情愿的希望所能改变的。英国承认像人民中国这样强大的国家，首先是从英国本身的利益出发的。”共和报（波兰政府机关报）以“六年——九十八天”为题，发表评论，把英国在一九二四年与苏联建立外交关系所历时间，和它宣布与中华人民共和国建立外交关系所历时间，作一对比。该报指出：这两个时间的对比，表示出自从伟大的十月革命以来世界上所发生的巨大变化。
    英工人日报说要给中英人民带来真正利益，必须发展中英贸易。
    据伦敦消息：英国工人日报七日以“对中国，下一步怎么办？”为题，发表社论，指出英国与中华人民共和国建立外交关系，乃是对于人民革命在亚洲最大的国土上确定无疑地获得胜利的这一事实的承认，而且是姗姗来迟的承认。但这只是一个开始。要给英国人民和中国人民带来真正的利益，便必须继之以大规模地发展贸易。社论继称：美国的资本家集团正在支持台湾的中国反动派残余，武器和装备正被匆匆地赶运到台湾，好使他们能继续组织所谓对中国的封锁，这种封锁将是对英国政府所具诚意的考验之一。
            瑞共机关报力促建立中瑞外交关系
    另据电通社哥本哈根九日讯：瑞典共产党机关报“新时代”报对英国与中华人民共和国建立外交关系一事发表社论称：这表明英帝国主义者现在正计算着与这个巨大的国家做生意的可能。社论续称：“蒋介石的代表，仍然在联合国大会和安全理事会中占着席位。”“这种对中国人民的挑衅态度，不能再予容忍。对帝国主义国家来说，被迫允许人民的代表参加安全理事会，实在是很痛苦的事。”社论最后力促瑞典与中华人民共和国建立外交关系说：“在决定是否承认人民自本国和外国压迫者之下解放出来的这一事实时，瑞典不应当是行列中的最后一个。”
