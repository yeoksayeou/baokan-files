In Northeast China, railways were liberated earlier, allowing them to first learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and implement work systems such as the responsibility system for train crews and the new road maintenance method. This enhanced the sense of ownership among railway workers, especially train crews, and thus led to better performance in improving locomotive efficiency and track quality. Most of the railways in North China were only liberated last year, but thanks to the active efforts of all employees and the commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps, not only has war damage been largely eliminated, but the responsibility system and the new road maintenance method have also begun to be implemented, improving transportation efficiency, reducing costs, and reversing the losses under Kuomintang rule. The railway equipment under the Zhengzhou Railway Administration was originally very poor, and suffered great damage during the Huaihai Campaign, resulting in relatively low transportation efficiency before November of last year. After the Ministry of Railways sent more than 60 personnel from the traffic and engineering departments to assist in November, the lines under the administration's jurisdiction have undergone major repairs, and transportation efficiency has improved accordingly. Most of the railways in South China were liberated recently. In addition to making every effort to restore traffic on important trunk lines such as the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, and the Hunan-Guangxi Railway, the Shanghai Railway Administration and the Hengyang Railway Administration both emphasize in their 1950 plans the need to actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union so as to rapidly improve transportation efficiency.

Although the national railways vigorously supported the Liberation War and ensured passenger and freight transportation last year, they still fell far short of actual needs. In December of last year, the Ministry of Railways only accepted 56 percent of the goods entrusted by public and private enterprises, and passenger congestion still existed. The main reason is the lack of vehicles. Therefore, continuing to repair and build new vehicles has become an important task in railway construction in 1950.

    首先学习苏联先进经验
    东北铁路成绩优良
    东北铁路因解放较早，得以首先学习苏联的先进经验，实行了乘务负责制、新养路法等工作制度，提高了铁路职工特别是乘务员的主人翁的感觉，因此在提高机车效能和线路质量各方面都作得比较好。北方铁路大部是去年以来才解放的，但在全体职工和铁道兵团指战员的积极努力下，不仅基本上已消灭了战争的破坏，而且也开始推行了负责制和新养路法等，提高了运输效率，减低了成本，改变了国民党统治时期的赔累现象。郑州局所属铁路设备原来就很差，经过淮海战役又受到很大损失，以致在去年十一月以前，运输效率还相当低。至十一月铁道部派去车务、工务等六十余人员予以协助后，该局管内线路已进行了大修补，运输效率亦已随之提高。南方铁路多系解放不久，上海局、衡阳局除已全力使京沪、浙赣、粤汉、湘桂等重要干线恢复通车以外，一九五○年计划中均强调要积极学习苏联先进经验，使运输效率迅速提高一步。
    全国铁路在去年一年中虽曾有力地支援了解放战争，保证了客货运输，但距实际需要还很远。去年十二月铁道部只接受了公私企业托运货物的百分之五十六，旅客拥挤现象也仍然存在。其主要原因是车辆不够。因此继续修复和新修车辆，即成为一九五○年铁道建设中的一个重要任务。
