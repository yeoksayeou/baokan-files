Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 19th: According to a recent statement by Polish Minister of Agriculture, Koziol, to the Polish News Agency in Warsaw: During the previous Three-Year Plan period, Poland built and repaired 2,300 kilometers of river embankments and dredged 4,000 kilometers of rivers. On 280,000 hectares of land, 28,000 kilometers of irrigation canals were dug, and water was drained from 11,000 hectares of land. The Żuławy region has also been completely reclaimed. This region, which Western German politicians like Schumacher considered would lie barren for a hundred years, now has 120,000 hectares of fertile land restored to agricultural production.

During the Six-Year Plan period that began this year, Poland will reclaim approximately 500,000 hectares of arable land and 500,000 hectares of pastures and grasslands. The Polish government has allocated a very large amount of loans specifically for this purpose, and by 1955, the loans will have tripled compared to this year.

    波兰发展灌溉和垦荒
    十二万公顷沃土恢复生产
    六年内将再垦五十万公顷
    【新华社北京十九日电】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：据波兰农业部长科齐奥尔最近宣称：在前此实行三年计划期中，波兰已建筑并修补了河堤二千三百公里，疏导河流四千公里。在二十八万公顷的土地上，挖掘了灌溉渠二万八千公里，并排尽了一万一千公顷土地上的积水。朱拉维地区也已全部被垦拓。这一地区曾被舒马赫之流的西德政客们认为要荒芜一百年，而现在，那里的十二万公顷沃土，却已恢复农业生产了。
    在今年开始的六年计划期中，波兰将要再开垦约五十万公顷的耕地和五十万公顷的牧场和草地。波兰政府专为这个目的所指拨的贷款数目非常庞大，到一九五五年，贷款将比今年增加三倍。
