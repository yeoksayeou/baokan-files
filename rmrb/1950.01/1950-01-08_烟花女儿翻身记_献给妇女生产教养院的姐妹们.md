(Continued from last issue, January 1st)

        Third Episode: Debt Collection

It is said that Gui Zhen was begging on the street,
Suddenly a person came towards her,
And hugged Gui Zhen in his arms,
Incessantly calling Gui Zhen's name,
The person said: "Gui Zhen, little sister, how can you not recognize me?"
Gui Zhen then looked up to see clearly,
It was better if Gui Zhen hadn't looked,
But once she looked, her feet jumped with joy in her heart,
It turned out to be her Sister Jinhua,
Truly "meeting an old friend in a foreign land!"
The two of them met, shedding tears and smiling,
Calling each other sister so affectionately,
Jinhua said: "The street is not the place for us sisters to talk,
Let's go to where I live and talk it over slowly."
The two of them walked hand-in-hand on the street,
At this time, Gui Zhen looked at Jinhua closely;
She saw her round face smeared with powder,
Vermilion rouge on her lips,
Slender phoenix eyes enhanced with black circles,
Eyebrows drawn into a single line,
Permed hair black and shiny,
A short-sleeved cheongsam fragrant.
Gui Zhen watched and thought,
"Sister Jinhua has become a wealthy person."
Before she knew it, they arrived quickly,
The New Life Hotel appeared before them,
They went up to the second floor, room number twenty-five,
Where the two sisters each told their stories of separation.
She learned that Jinhua worked as a waitress in a restaurant,
Her foster sister had been the introducer,
Gui Zhen quickly asked Sister Jinhua again,
"Where has Brother Deqiang settled down?"
Jinhua burst into tears before answering,
And cursed the damned "Central Army",
Brother Deqiang had only been here for two days,
When he was seized by the "Central Army" to be a soldier,
Since being seized, the siblings have not met,
And it is not known whether he is dead or alive?
Gui Zhen cried loudly upon hearing this,
Even a heart of stone would be saddened.
The sisters talked for a while and cried for a while,
Then comforted each other to ease their minds.
While they were talking, the tea boy brought a letter,
Jinhua quickly opened it to read clearly,
It was written, "Jinhua, my foster sister,
I, your foster sister, write to you with tears in my eyes,
Only because I am poor and cannot repay my foster mother's debt,
My foster mother has sold me to someone,
Alas, having sold my body, I no longer have control,
And must immediately go to Beijing with them,
In the future, I can no longer help you,
Leaving you, sister, to spend your days alone,
Unable to meet my sister again,
It feels like ten thousand steel knives piercing my heart."
Jinhua burst into tears after reading,
Gui Zhen also cried inconsolably,
From then on, the two sisters lived together,
The two sisters independently sought a livelihood,
Both worked as waitresses at the Xingsheng Restaurant,
Serving people by carrying soup and delivering water,
Eating two cornbread buns a day,
With leftover soup and water as vegetable soup,
Only able to share a small amount of tips,
And unable to pay the hotel room fee.
In the blink of an eye, it was the twelfth lunar month,
The cold wind howled, and the leaves withered,
Snowflakes fluttered like goose feathers,
The flowing river water froze into ice.
The sisters needed to make cotton-padded clothes and quilts for the winter,
And the hotel landlady was willing to lend them money,
One day, Gui Zhen caught a cold and fell ill,
And borrowed money to buy medicine to treat the illness.
The two sisters both said the landlady had a good heart,
And called her "Mother" with every word.
One day, it was the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, the Little New Year,
The two sisters were talking in their room,
Jinhua said: "If I were to say my fate is bad, it's still considered good,
Everywhere I go, I meet kind people,
The first benefactor is my foster sister,
Whose kindness to me is as deep as the sea,
The second benefactor is the hotel landlady,
Who treats us sisters like her own,
If one day I have good luck,
I will first repay their kindness properly."
Gui Zhen said: "Sister, you are right,
As the saying goes, it's wrong to live if you don't repay kindness."
As the two were talking,
The tea boy, Li Erhun, entered,
Followed by the accountant, Mr. Zhou Jingru,
The two sisters quickly stood up,
And said: "How are you two doing in the New Year,
What brings you to my sisters' room?"
Zhou Jingru said: "It's just a small matter,
We wouldn't dare enter your embroidered room if there wasn't anything,
It's just that the landlady is short of money,
So she sent the two of us to trouble you."
As he spoke, he took out an account book,
With each line written truthfully,
"The room fee for the past six months is eighty-five yuan,
Including principal and interest, it is one hundred and fifty-two yuan and two cents,
There are a total of thirteen items in this loan,
Totaling seventy-five yuan in silver,
Including principal and interest, it is a total of one hundred and thirty yuan,
The sum of these two items is two hundred and eighty-two yuan and two cents,
Ladies, please take a look,
Each item is written clearly in the account."
The two sisters trembled upon hearing this,
So frightened that their heads swelled and their eyes blurred,
Jinhua said: "I want to see the landlady,
I want to see Mother and beg for kindness."
Li Erhun quickly said: "Good, good, good,
I was just about to take you two to see her."
The four people walked quickly together,
And arrived at the landlady's grand gate.
The two sisters entered the room,
And the landlady quickly stood up to welcome them,
Offering cigarettes and tea,
Jinhua and Gui Zhen called her so affectionately,
Her fat face was smiling,
Her eyes narrowed into a line with her smile.
Sitting next to her was a man,
With thick eyebrows and drooping eyes like a plague god,
He had a cigarette in his mouth and tilted his head,
His eyes constantly staring at the two girls.
Seeing the landlady's smiling face, Jinhua felt
A weight lifted from her heart,
And began to call her "Dear Mother,"
"I beg you, dear Mother, to show kindness,
We sisters owe you, old Mother, money,
But we will slowly repay it in the future."
The landlady laughed heartily upon hearing this,
"You two sisters should set your minds at ease,
It's not that I want to make things difficult for you two sisters,
It's just that I have a bitter story in my heart,
This year, my luck has been bad opening the hotel,
And I've been borrowing everywhere to make ends meet,
You two sisters have lived in the hotel for more than half a year,
And I haven't treated you badly,
If you wanted to spend money or borrow money,
I never said no,
Now I have no choice,
And had to trouble you two to clear the account."
If you want to know what happened next,
Listen to the next episode for clarification.

        Fourth Episode: Rape

It is said that the sisters saw the landlady,
And begged the landlady to show kindness,
The landlady was kind-faced but unkind-hearted,
And wanted the sisters to clear the account.
Gui Zhen felt that something was wrong,
And quickly pleaded, calling her "Mother,"
"Alas, my sisters are helpless and alone,
How can we have so much money to clear the account?"
The landlady said: "You two sisters don't worry,
I have a good idea that you should listen to,
This gentleman's surname is Sun, and his name is Sun Deying,
And he is a big businessman in this area,
Mr. Sun is forty-five years old this year,
And he is single with no children,
Having heard that you two are kind and pitiful,
Mr. Sun is also a vegetarian Buddhist who does good deeds,
And he is willing to take you two sisters as foster daughters,
You two should quickly bow to him and call him foster father,
He will pay your debt to me,
And from then on, you two will have someone to rely on and a family."
Mr. Sun smiled to the side and nodded,
"Do you two agree or not?"
The sisters thought that this was also good,
Or else they wouldn't be able to clear the account,
And had no choice but to nod and agree,
Quickly kowtowing and calling him foster father.
The landlady and Mr. Sun both laughed heartily,
Their laughter startled the two sisters.
The landlady took out a piece of paper from the drawer,
With black words written truthfully on white paper,
The landlady asked the sisters to put their handprints on it,
Jinhua took it and looked at it clearly,
It was originally a contract of sale,
With each word and line written clearly,
It was written that she was selling the two of them to Sun Deying,
For a price of three hundred yuan in silver,
It also wrote that if they were to jump into a well, jump into a river, hang themselves, or slit their throats,
The Sun family would not be responsible in any way.
Jinhua's heart trembled upon seeing this,
And quickly asked, "Why are these things written on it?"
Mr. Sun said from the side, "It doesn't matter,
It's just the old procedure for writing a contract for people."
The two sisters were confused and put their handprints on it,
Packed their luggage and went to Sun's house,
As soon as the sisters entered the door, they felt something was wrong,
How could there be four or five sisters in this Sun's house,
Each dressed in red and green,
Painted and powdered like goblins,
All calling Sun Deying "dear Daddy,"
And this Sun would glare at them, and everyone would be terrified.
There was a tall, middle-aged woman,
With a long face and thin lips,
With two inches of rouge on her face,
Wearing a green wool coat and a red scarf,
When she spoke, her mouth twisted downward,
And her pair of night owl eyes were sinister,
Sun Deying introduced her to the sisters,
And wanted them to call her "Mother,"
At night, Gui Zhen had to sleep in the same bed with this female goblin,
And Jinhua went to another room to settle down.
Gui Zhen lay in bed feeling worried,
And dared not speak a word,
Tossing and turning, unable to sleep,
With thousands of thoughts surging in her heart,
"What kind of family is this?
Why did they separate her sisters?
Where is Brother Deqiang?
When will they be reunited and married?
Will the days ahead be sweet or bitter?
How will I live my life from now on?"
Thinking it over and over, she couldn't stop crying,
Crying for her mother who had died so early.
She finally fell asleep in a daze,
Her mind was in turmoil,
Suddenly, someone broke into the door,
Scaring Gui Zhen out of her wits,
Just as she was about to shout for help,
Her mouth was stuffed with cotton cloth, and she couldn't shout,
Her feet and hands were held down,
And she couldn't move at all,
White cloth fell into the dye vat,
And fresh flowers fell into the muddy pit.
The next day, they wanted Gui Zhen to receive guests,
To be a prostitute making suggestive faces.
Gui Zhen was unwilling and cursed loudly,
Enraging the pimp Sun Deying,
"He cursed, 'You slut, Sun, how dare you!
You dare to act tough with your master,
I'll give you a taste of my power,
You don't know the rules, you don't know the ways!'"
As he spoke, he locked Gui Zhen in a small room,
Took out a stick from under the bed,
And beat her wildly with the stick,
Beating her until her skin was torn and her flesh flew, and her whole body ached,
He Gui Zhen was born with a stubborn nature,
She gritted her teeth and hardened her heart,
Accepting the beating and enduring the pain,
She would rather die than cry out in pain,
The pimp Sun Deying added fuel to the fire,
And cursed, "You little devil, Sun, you're so stubborn,
"He tore off all of Gui Zhen's clothes,
Leaving only her underpants on her lower body,
And pushed Gui Zhen out of the door into the snow,
"I'll freeze you to death, you little devil!'"
It was the freezing weather of the seventeenth day of the first lunar month,
And the snow was three inches deep,
Alas, the naked Gui Zhen,
Lay in the snow, suffering torture,
Waves of cold wind were like knives,
And flakes of snow were like steel nails,
Her upper teeth chattered against her lower jaw,
And her whole body shivered,
Mouthfuls of cold air pierced her heart and lungs,
Her lips were black, and her face was green,
All the muscles in her body contracted together,
Her ears buzzed like thunder,
The joints of her limbs felt like axes were stabbing them,
Her eyes were blurred and saw sparks,
In an instant, her whole body was frozen numb,
And she was in a daze, not knowing the pain.
She had been frozen for a good half hour,
When the pimp Sun Deying came,
And dragged Gui Zhen back into the small room,
It took a long time for He Gui Zhen to wake up,
The pimp Sun's eyebrows shot up and his eyes swept around,
Holding a whip, he asked,
"If you don't obey tonight,
I'll slowly torture you until dawn,
I bought you and your sister for three hundred yuan,
And your lives are in my hands,
If you anger me,
I'll peel your skin and pull out your tendons!"
As he spoke, he was about to use the whip again,
When the old goblin came in from outside,
If you want to know whether Gui Zhen lives or dies,
Listen to the next episode for clarification.

    烟花女儿翻身记
    献给妇女生产教养院的姐妹们

    （续上期，一月一日）
           第三回  逼债
    却说桂贞讨吃街上走，
    突然迎面来了个人，
    一把把桂贞抱在怀，
    口里不住叫桂贞，
    那人说：“桂贞妹妹你怎么认不得我？”
    桂贞这才抬头看分明，
    桂贞她不看还则可，
    这一看她两脚直蹦心中好高兴，
    原来是她的金花姐，
    真个是“他乡遇故人！”
    她二人见面又是流泪又是笑，
    姐姐妹妹叫的好亲，
    金花说：“大街上不是咱姐妹谈话处，
    到我住的那儿再慢慢谈个分明。”
    她二人手拉手儿街上走，
    这时候桂贞才把金花看了个够；
    她见她圆圆的脸蛋抹上了粉，
    朱红的胭脂涂嘴唇，
    细长的凤眼添上了黑圈，
    眉毛划成了线一根，
    电烫的头发乌黑亮，
    短袖的旗袍香喷喷。
    桂贞边看边思想，
    “金花姐成了有钱的人。”
    说话之间来得快，
    新生活旅馆面前呈，
    上了二楼二十五号房间内，
    姐妹二人才各诉各的离别情。
    才知道金花在饭馆当女招待，
    她干姐姐做的介绍人，
    桂贞又忙把金花姐问，
    “德强哥哥在那里安下身？”
    金花未答话先流泪，
    骂了声天杀的“中央军”，
    德强哥在这里刚两天，
    被“中央军”抓去当了兵，
    抓去后兄妹就没见过面，
    还不知是死还是生？
    桂贞一听放声大哭，
    铁石人见了也伤心。
    姐妹俩说一阵来哭一阵，
    又互相解劝放宽心。
    说话间茶房送来了一封信，
    金花忙拆开看分明，
    上写着“金花我的干妹妹，
    干姐姐我含泪给你写信音，
    只因我人穷还不了干妈的债，
    干妈将我卖给了人，
    可怜我卖了身的人儿不自主，
    立刻要跟人家到北京，
    今后我再不能帮助你，
    留下妹妹你独自过光阴，
    不能给妹妹再见面，
    好像万把钢刀扎在心。”
    金花看罢放声大哭，
    桂贞也哭的不成声，
    从此姐妹俩一块儿住，
    姐妹俩独自谋营生，
    一同在兴盛饭店当女招待，
    端汤递水侍候人，
    一天吃两顿窝窝头，
    残汤剩水做菜羹，
    只能分一点小账钱，
    旅馆的房钱就还不清。
    转眼到了十冬腊月，
    寒风凛凛树叶凋零，
    雪花飘飘如鹅毛，
    河水下流冻成了冰。
    姐妹俩过冬要制棉衣被，
    这旅馆老板娘都愿意借钱给她们，
    有一天桂贞受寒得下了病，
    又借钱吃药把病诊。
    姐妹俩都说老板娘心眼好，
    都把她口口声声叫娘亲。
    有一天正是正月十五过小年，
    姐妹俩在房里正谈心，
    金花说：“要说我命不好却还算好，
    处处都遇见了这善心人，
    第一个恩人是我干姐姐，
    待我的恩情海水一样深，
    第二个恩人是旅馆老板娘，
    待咱姐妹如亲生，
    我那一天要是走了好运，
    我首先要好好报答她们的恩。”
    桂贞说：“姐姐你说得对，
    常言说有恩不报枉活人。”
    二人把话谈到此，
    进来了茶房伙计李二混，
    后跟着账房先生周敬如，
    姐妹俩连忙站起身，
    忙说：“二位新年过得好，
    来我姐妹房里有什么事情？”
    周敬如说：“有点小小的事，
    没事不敢登二位的绣房门，
    只因是老板娘短钱花，
    才打发我们二人来麻烦你们。”
    说话之间身边掏出了一本账，
    一行一行写的真，
    “这半年的房钱是八十五块，
    连本带利是一百五十二块零二分，
    这借账一共有十三项，
    一共是七十五块大头银，
    连本带利一共是一百三十整，
    这两笔一总是二百八十二块零二分，
    二位小姐请过目，
    这一项一项账上可写的清。”
    姐妹俩听罢全身哆嗦，
    直吓得头胀眼发昏，
    金花说：“我要把老板娘见，
    我要见娘亲求求恩。”
    李二混连忙说：“好好好
    正要领你俩去见她们。”
    四个人一道儿走的快，
    来到了老板娘大门庭。
    姐妹俩进得了房门里，
    老板娘连忙起身把他俩迎，
    又叫吸烟又叫喝茶，
    金花桂贞叫的个亲，
    那肥胖的脸上带着笑，
    眼睛笑成了线一根。
    旁边坐着个男子汉，
    长的粗眉吊眼像个瘟神，
    他口含着香烟歪着头，
    两眼不住朝她姐儿俩身上盯。
    金花见老板娘面带笑，
    一块石头落地坪，
    开口就把亲娘叫，
    “请求亲娘你宽宽恩，
    我姐妹俩欠你老人家的钱，
    以后慢慢的来还清。”
    老板娘一听哈哈笑，
    “说是你姐儿俩放宽心，
    非是我跟你俩姐妹来为难，
    实因我肚子里有苦情，
    今年开旅馆我时运不好，
    到处拉借过光阴，
    你俩姐妹在旅馆住了半年多，
    我可没有亏待你们，
    你要花来你要借，
    我没有半个不字出嘴唇，
    如今我也是没办法，
    才麻烦你俩把账还清。”
    要知道以后怎么样，
    且听下回说分明。
               第四回  强奸
    却说姊妹们见了老板娘，
    祷告老板娘宽宽恩，
    老板面善心不善，
    要叫她姐妹把账还清。
    桂贞一听话不对劲，
    连忙哀告叫娘亲，
    “可怜我姐妹俩无依又无靠，
    那有许多银钱把账清。”
    老板娘说：“你姐儿俩甭着急，
    我有个好办法你且听，
    这位先生姓孙名叫孙德英，
    本是此地的大买卖人，
    孙先生今年四十五岁，
    没儿没女是个单身，
    听说你俩人好又可怜，
    孙先生又是个吃斋念佛的行善人，
    愿收你姐儿俩做干女儿，
    你俩快拜他叫干父亲，
    你欠我的债他替你还，
    从此你俩有依有靠有了家门。”
    那孙先生一旁笑笑点了点头，
    “你俩个答应不答应？”
    姐儿俩一想这也好，
    要不这笔账可还不清，
    只好点头说答应，
    连忙叩头叫干父亲。
    老板娘和孙先生都哈哈大笑，
    笑得姐妹俩人直发怔。
    老板娘在抽屉取出一张纸，
    白纸黑字写的真，
    老板娘叫她姐妹按手印，
    金花接过来看分明，
    原本是一张卖身契，
    字字行行写的清，
    上写着把她俩卖给孙德英，
    卖的是三百块大头银，
    又写着要是投井、投河、悬梁，抹颈，
    孙家一概不负责任。
    金花一见心胆战，
    连忙问“写上这些是何原因？”
    孙先生一旁说“这没关系，
    不过是写约人的老规程。”
    姐妹俩迷迷糊糊就按了手印，
    收拾行李就到了孙家的门，
    姐妹一进门就觉得不对劲，
    这孙家怎么有姐妹四、五人，
    一个个穿红又挂绿，
    划眉抹粉像个妖精，
    都把这孙德英叫亲爸，
    这姓孙的一瞪眼大家就掉了魂。
    有一个大个儿的中年妇女，
    长长的脸儿薄薄的唇，
    脸上的胭脂足有二寸厚，
    穿着件绿呢大衣挽着个红围巾，
    一说话嘴巴往下歪，
    夜猫子的一对眼珠阴森森，
    孙德英给她姐妹来介绍，
    要她俩叫她做娘亲，
    到晚上要桂贞与这女妖精一床睡，
    金花到另外的房里去安身。
    桂贞躺在床上直发愁，
    也不敢说话啃一声，
    翻来覆去睡不着，
    千头万绪涌在心，
    “不知道这一家人是干什么的？
    为什么要把她姐妹俩离分？
    不知道德强哥哥在那里？
    何时才能团圆结了婚？
    不知道今后日月是甜与苦？
    往下如何过光阴？”
    思前想后直落泪，
    直哭早死了我的娘亲。
    昏昏沉沉总算入了梦，
    神魂颠倒乱纷纷，
    猛然间有人闯进门，
    吓得桂贞掉了魂，
    张口正要喊救命，
    棉布塞口就喊叫不成，
    双脚双手被人压住，
    要想动弹万不能，
    白布掉在了染缸里，
    鲜花落在了污泥坑。
    第二天又要桂贞去接客，
    去作那挤眉弄眼的卖淫人。
    桂贞女不情愿她破口大骂，
    一旁气坏了领家孙德英，
    “骂了声贱人孙你好大的胆！
    你敢跟你大爷耍蛮横，
    不给你点厉害你尝尝味，
    你不懂规矩你不懂门！”
    说话间把桂贞关在了小房内，
    床底下取出棍一根，
    乒乓乒乓一阵乱棍打，
    只打得皮烂肉飞浑身疼，
    何桂贞生来性子硬，
    牙关一咬心一横，
    任打任挨认了个死，
    打死打活也不叫疼，
    领家孙德英火上加了油，
    骂了声小人孙你性子好硬，
    把桂贞的衣裳全扒了个光，
    只留裤衩在下身，
    一掌把桂贞推在门外雪地里，
    “我活活的要冻死你这小人孙！”
    这本是正月十七的冰冻天，
    雪花铺的有三寸深，
    只可怜赤身露体的桂贞女，
    躺在雪地受酷刑，
    阵阵的寒风如刀割，
    片片的雪花似钢钉，
    冻得来上牙直打下牙巴，
    浑身哆嗦战兢兢，
    口口的寒气穿心肺，
    咀唇乌黑脸发青，
    全身的肌肉朝一块儿抽，
    两耳哄哄如雷鸣，
    四肢关节如斧子扎，
    两眼昏花冒火星，
    霎时浑身冻的麻木了，
    昏昏沉沉也不知疼。
    足足冻了有半点钟，
    才来了领家的孙德英，
    将桂贞拖回了小房里，
    半天才醒过来何桂贞，
    孙领家眉毛一横眼一扫，
    手拿皮鞭把话问，
    “你要是今夜不服气，
    我慢慢折腾你到天明，
    我三百块洋钱买了你姐妹人两个
    性命也握在了爷们的手掌心，
    你要把爷们的脾气惹发了，
    我剥了你的皮来抽了你的筋！
    说着说着又要用皮鞭打，
    门外进来了老妖精，
    要知桂贞死与活，
    且听下回说分明。
    （第四回完，下期续载）。
