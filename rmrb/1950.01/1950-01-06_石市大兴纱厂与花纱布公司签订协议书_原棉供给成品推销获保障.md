    Shijiazhuang Da Xing Yarn Factory Signs Agreement with Textile Company:
    Raw Cotton Supply and Finished Product Sales Guaranteed
    [Report from this newspaper] The Shijiazhuang Textile Branch Company and Da Xing Textile Factory signed an agreement on December 3rd for exchanging finished products for raw cotton. This agreement was reached after several discussions between representatives of both parties based on the principles of considering both public and private interests and mutual benefit. The agreement stipulates the exchange of finished products including 20-count yarn, 18-count yarn, 10-count yarn, "Shan Lu" cloth, and velvet balls. The exchange rate is: one bale (40 *jin* - same below) of 20-count yarn exchanges for 585 *jin* of cotton, one bale of 18-count yarn exchanges for 577 *jin* of cotton, one bale of 10-count yarn exchanges for 553 *jin* of cotton, one bolt of "Shan Lu" cloth exchanges for 22.5 *jin* of cotton, and one velvet blanket exchanges for 3.4 *jin* of cotton. The Shijiazhuang Textile Branch Company will supply Da Xing Textile Factory with the raw cotton needed for the above-mentioned finished products. The agreement is valid for three months. Both parties expressed satisfaction after the agreement was signed. According to Da Xing Textile Factory's monthly cotton requirement of approximately 3,000 *dan*, if they were to purchase it themselves, based on the current cotton price, they would need to raise over 2 billion *yuan*, and this would only be a single set of funds. If they were unable to sell the finished products, they would encounter difficulties in turnover. After signing the agreement for exchanging finished products for raw cotton with the Textile Branch Company, the factory's production and sales are guaranteed.

    石市大兴纱厂与花纱布公司签订协议书
    原棉供给成品推销获保障
    【本报讯】石家庄花纱布分公司和大兴纺织厂，已于十二月三日签订成品交换原棉协议书。这个协议书是根据公私兼顾，互惠两利的原则，经双方代表数次商讨获得协议。协议书规定交换成品计有二十支纱、十八支纱、十支纱、山鹿布、绒球等数种。交换率是二十支纱一包（四十斤—下同）换棉五百八十五斤，十八支纱一包换棉五百七十七斤，十支纱一包换棉五百五十三斤，山鹿布一匹换棉二十二斤半，绒毯一条换棉三斤四两。石市花纱布分公司按照以上各种成品所需的原棉供给大兴纺织厂。协议书有效时间为三个月。协议书签订后，双方都表示满意。按大兴纺织厂每月所需棉花约三千多担，若自己采购，以现在棉价计算，得筹备二十余亿元，但这仅是一套资金，若遇成品推销不出时，周转就要发生困难；与花纱布分公司签订成品交换原棉协议书后，该厂生产及推销就得到了可靠的保障。
