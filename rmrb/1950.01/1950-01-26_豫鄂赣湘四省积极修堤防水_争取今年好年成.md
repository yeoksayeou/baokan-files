    [By Our Newspaper] The four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan in the Central South region are actively carrying out dike construction work to prepare for a great production year. In order to accelerate flood control and river management projects, the Henan Provincial Government has decided to allocate 19 million jin of grain, combining production with disaster relief, and implement a work-for-food program to repair dikes and prevent floods. Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces have each held water conservancy work conferences, deciding that the main tasks of current water conservancy work are to build the main dikes of the Yangtze River and the dikes and embankments of its tributaries and large and small lakes. Work has already started in Mianyang, Qianjiang, Tianmen, Huanggang and other places in Hubei, and the Jundebao breach closure project in Hanchuan was fully completed on the 9th of this month. Xin Dichen, Mianyang has decided to open the Honghu dike gate, which is estimated to require more than 9 million labor days. The Hubei Provincial Government has now selected and dispatched more than 90 water conservancy technicians to various places to help repair dikes. It is estimated that after the completion of the project, more than one million mu of farmland can be protected from floods. The people's governments of the eleven counties bordering Dongting Lake in Hunan and other flood-affected areas are actively leading the masses to carry out dike repair work during the winter dry season under the principle of "government assistance with people's efforts" in order to restore agricultural production. The plan is to complete the dike restoration project before March of this year. The dike repair projects in various counties and districts along the river in Jiangxi Province started comprehensively in mid-December. As of the 14th of this month, statistics from only ten counties, including Nanchang, Xinjian, Fengcheng, Jinxian, Linchuan, Jiujiang, Pengze, Poyang, Yugan, and Yongxiu, show that more than 467,000 cubic meters of earthwork have been completed. The Fudayou embankment in Nanchang City has been 84 percent completed.
