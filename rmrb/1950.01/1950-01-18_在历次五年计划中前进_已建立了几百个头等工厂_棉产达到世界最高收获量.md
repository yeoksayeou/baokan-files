    Advancing in Successive Five-Year Plans
    Hundreds of First-Class Factories Established
    Cotton Production Reaches World's Highest Yield
    During Stalin's successive Five-Year Plans, the Republic established hundreds of first-class factories. Heavy industry accounts for 42 percent of total industrial output. Uzbekistan is now able to supply the country with coal, oil, steel, rolled metal, mineral fertilizers, cranes, excavators, machine tools, diesel engines, cotton harvesters, mowing machines, seed drills, textile machinery, wires, building materials, textiles, other consumer goods, and food, etc. It also has its own national technical workers and expert cadres.

    Uzbekistan also has large-scale socialist agriculture. 93 percent of the total sown area of collective farms is cultivated by machines and tractors. Due to mechanization and the adoption of advanced agricultural methods, cotton farmers in Uzbekistan have achieved the world's highest yields. Hundreds of labor teams from collective farms and state farms have obtained more than six tons of cotton per hectare, while advanced cotton farmers have obtained more than ten tons. Uzbekistan has become the main supplier of cotton in the Soviet Union. Uzbekistan supplies 60 percent of all Astrakhan lambskins in the Soviet Union, and its silkworm breeders supply more than half of all cocoons in the Soviet Union. The Republic is also a large supplier of fruits, vegetables, and rice.

    The Soviet system has not only helped the people of Uzbekistan overcome economic backwardness but also cultural backwardness. Before the revolution, only two or three out of every hundred people in Uzbekistan could read and write, but today, Uzbekistan is a country where the people are generally literate. More than 5,000 schools have been established in cities and villages. Before the October Revolution, there were no higher education institutions in Central Asia, but today, there are 36 higher education institutions and 95 technical schools in Uzbekistan alone. The Uzbek Academy of Sciences and dozens of scientific research institutes have been established. The Republic has opened many theaters, cultural palaces, museums, and publishing houses. Uzbekistan publishes 120 kinds of newspapers. Many talented writers, composers, painters, and actors, as well as many doctors of science, have emerged from the people of Uzbekistan.

    Compared with before the revolution, the cities and villages of Uzbekistan have changed beyond recognition. Every city has large apartments, water and electricity facilities, cultural parks, paved squares, and streets. Tashkent, the capital of the Republic, has become a beautiful garden city.

    在历次五年计划中前进
    已建立了几百个头等工厂
    棉产达到世界最高收获量
    在斯大林历次五年计划时期，共和国建立了几百个头等的工厂。重工业占全部工业产量的百分之四十二。乌兹贝克现在已能供给国家以煤、石油、钢、辗金属、矿物肥料、起重机、挖掘机、工作母机、柴油引擎、摘棉机、刈草机、条播机、纺织机器、电线、建筑材料，纺织品、其他消费品和食品等等。也有了本民族的技术工人和专家干部。
    乌兹贝克也有着大规模的社会主义农业。集体农场全部播种面积的百分之九十三，都是由机器与拖拉机耕种的。由于机械化和采用了进步的农业方法，使乌兹贝克的棉农得到世界上最高的收获量。几百个集体农场和国营农场的劳动队，得到每公顷六吨多的棉花，而先进的棉农则得到十多吨。乌兹贝克已成为苏联棉花的主要供应地。乌兹贝克供给了苏联全部阿斯特拉罕羔羊皮的百分之六十，而其养蚕者则供给了苏联全部茧子的一半以上。共和国也是水果、蔬菜和米的大量供给者。
    苏维埃制度不仅帮助乌兹贝克人民克服了经济上的落后，并且也克服了文化上的落后。在革命以前，乌兹贝克每百人中仅有两三个人能读能写，而在今天，乌兹贝克则已是人民普遍能读能写的国家。在城市和乡村中，已建立了五千多所学校。在十月革命以前，中亚细亚是没有高等教育机关的，而今天，单是在乌兹贝克就有三十六所高等教育机关和九十五所技术学校。乌兹贝克科学院和几十个科学研究所已经成立。共和国已开设了许多剧院、文化宫、博物院、出版所。乌兹贝克出版的报纸有一百二十种。乌兹贝克人民中产生了许多有天才的作家、作曲家、画家和演员，也产生了许多科学博士。
    乌兹贝克的城市和乡村，和革命前比较起来，已改变得不能辨认了。每一个城市里都有大的公寓、水电设备、文化公园、铺砌的广场和街道。共和国的首都塔什干，已变成了美丽的花园城。
