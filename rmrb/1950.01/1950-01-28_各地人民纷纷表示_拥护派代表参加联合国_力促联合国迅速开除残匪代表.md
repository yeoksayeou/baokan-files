Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 27th: People across the country have expressed their support for the Central People's Government's appointment of Zhang Wentian as the chief representative of the Chinese delegation to participate in the work of the United Nations, and strongly urge the United Nations to immediately expel the representatives of the Kuomintang remnant clique. Xiraojiacuo (Tibetan), Vice Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, who is attending the first meeting of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, said: The Tibetan people are deeply resentful of the imperialists' continued attempts to support the representatives of the Chinese reactionary clique in the United Nations; and are deeply grateful for the lofty friendship of the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries in consistently supporting our just demands. The Tibetan people demand that the United Nations immediately expel the Kuomintang representatives. Ma Mingfang, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government, Deng Baoshan, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial People's Government, Zhao Shoushan, Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, Gan Siqi, Deputy Political Commissar of the Northwest Military Region, and Tao Zhiyue, Commander of the 22nd Army Corps, have also expressed similar opinions on this matter. The Chongqing Municipal First People's Representative Conference, which is currently being held, sent a telegram to the Central People's Government stating: We, representing the 1.2 million people of Chongqing, warmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, and we will never give up until the goal of expelling the remnant Kuomintang bandit group's delegation from the United Nations is achieved! At the same time, we unanimously support the delegation headed by Zhang Wentian, which truly represents the Chinese people, and we eagerly hope that they will participate in the work of the United Nations as soon as possible. Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, who is currently living in Guangzhou, stated: The People's Republic of China has the inescapable responsibility of maintaining world peace. In accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, the appointment of Zhang Wentian by our Central People's Government as the chief representative to participate in the work of the United Nations, and the proposal to expel the representatives of the Kuomintang remnant clique, is the most reasonable and legal demand, and the United Nations has no reason not to accept it. Li Boqiu, the person in charge of the Southern General Branch of the China Democratic League, also made a statement, expressing firm support for the Central People's Government's measures regarding the United Nations issue. The preparatory committee for the Guiyang Municipal People's Representative Conference, as well as people from all walks of life in Hebei Province and Nanning City, Guangxi Province, have also expressed their support for this measure by the People's Government.
