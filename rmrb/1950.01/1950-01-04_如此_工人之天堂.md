Such a "Worker's Paradise"
    Xiang Qun

    What is the actual situation in the United States, which the American "Goebbels" boast is a "worker's paradise"?

    According to materials from the American "Labor Research Association": From 1941 to 1947, the cost of living index rose from 107 to 180, while real wages during this period decreased from 116 to 115. Taking an average worker's family as an example: In February 1947, the weekly cost of living budget was $74.69, while the weekly wage was only $50.43.

    Conversely, in 1937, the net profit of major American companies was $3.9 billion, but by 1947, the surplus had increased to $17.4 billion. In the seven years from 1940 to 1946, the total net profit of major companies was 66.5 billion, which is greater than the entire national income of 1938!

    Another startling fact is that six million children in the United States do not attend school, and twenty million adults, nearly 20 percent of the total US population, are illiterate. Eight million people have not received a complete primary education. Three million citizens of voting age have never attended school.

    如此“工人之天堂”
    向群
    美国“戈培尔”们所夸耀为“工人之天堂”的美国，实际情形是怎样的呢？
    根据美国“劳工研究联合会”的材料：从一九四一年到一九四七年当中，生活指数从一○七上升到一八○，同时这个时期的真正薪资则从一一六降低到一一五。以一个普通工人家庭为例：在一九四七年二月里，一周的生活费用预算是七四·六九元，而一周的工资仅仅只有五○·四三元。
    相反的，一九三七年美国各大公司的净利是三十九亿美元，到一九四七年赢余的数目，就增加到一百七十四亿美元了。从一九四○到一九四六年的七年中间，各大公司净利的总额是六百六十五亿，这笔数目比一九三八年的全年国家收入还大！
    另外一个惊人的事实是：美国有六百万儿童没有进学校，有两千万成人，即几乎占美国全部人口的百分之二十是文盲。有八百万人没有受到完全的初级教育。有三百万达到选举年龄的公民从未进过学校。（译自十月二十八日英文版“争取持久和平、争取人民民主”！）
