The Shandong Provincial People's Government and its affiliated trade companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, and local economic departments are currently vigorously developing urban-rural trade, purchasing local products, and organizing sideline production to overcome famine. Some areas have already achieved considerable success. The Provincial Trade Corporation, in order to adapt industrial products to seasonal needs, in addition to allocating a large amount of materials to the countryside previously, has recently continued to allocate to Lunan, Lu Zhong and Bohai regions over seven hundred fifty barrels of kerosene, forty thousand catties of white and brown sugar, nearly two thousand boxes of matches, as well as towels, socks, toothpaste, various colored cloth, and other daily necessities, worth over RMB 1.6 billion. In order to support the production of local match industries and solve their raw material difficulties, the company recently allocated over six thousand catties of phosphorus sulfide, over one thousand catties each of rosin and aluminum hydroxide, over two thousand catties of wax material, and nine thousand catties of sodium nitrate to Jinan and Weifang. Yidu, Yishui, Linqu, and other places have suffered from stagnant sales of local specialties such as mountain fruits, almonds, and walnuts due to years of war and the long-term blockade by the enemy and puppets. In order to combine production and disaster relief, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has determined that its winter task will focus on vigorously purchasing mountain fruits. Yidu, Linqu, Yishui, Yiyuan, Juyi, and Zibo are famous specialty areas in Shandong. Yidu and Linqu counties alone produce 100,000 catties of almonds, over 600,000 catties of walnuts, and over 777,000 catties of dried persimmons annually. Other famous products such as honey peaches and hawthorn slices have even greater yields. Before the war, the income from mountain fruits accounted for 40% of the total income of local farmers. This time, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative's purchases are mostly made through promotion societies and cooperatives, using contract-based purchases. According to statistics, as of late December last year, counties had purchased a total of over 701,000 catties of mountain fruits such as dried persimmons, walnuts, hawthorn slices, and black dates. Including the thirty thousand catties purchased by state-owned enterprises in Yidu and the four hundred thousand catties purchased by private merchants, the total purchase was over 1,453,000 catties, which, calculated at one catty of grain per catty of mountain fruit, can increase the equivalent of over one million catties of grain. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative is still continuing its purchases. In order to ensure that farmers can buy daily necessities after selling their mountain fruits and to help stabilize prices, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative has successively transported to Yidu and other places over two hundred seventy boxes of matches, over 330,000 catties of sorghum, over 26,000 catties of bean cake, 375 bolts of colored cloth, over 33,000 catties of green beans, 100,000 catties of salt, and cotton yarn. In the process of acquisition, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative also paid attention to consolidating and developing cooperatives, attracting members, and expanding shares. Generally, members reflect, "In previous years, hawthorns fell to the ground and no one cared. This year, chopping and drying them turns them into money."
    The cooperative still has some shortcomings in its acquisition process: for example, the Yishui and Zibo promotion societies did not sufficiently explain the significance of this acquisition of mountain fruits to the masses, and their control of prices was too mechanical.

    [Another Dispatch] In Huaiyang, Chenliu, Xin County and other counties, the People's Government and banks allocated a large amount of grain and funds to support the disaster area farmers to engage in sideline production immediately. For example, the Huaiyang branch of the People's Bank decided to loan 575,000 catties of miscellaneous grains and RMB 130 million to support the masses in transportation and other handicraft sideline industries. And send cadres to cooperate with district and township cadres, planning to organize 100 carts in Huaiyang, 200 carts in Shangshui, 140 carts in Shenqiu, 40 carts in Xiangcheng, and 600 carts in Luyi and Taikang to transport cotton, sesame, native cloth, sesame oil, reed mats and other agricultural specialties and by-products out of the area, and exchange them for necessities such as salt, grain and paper to communicate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. The Huaiyang Special District Cooperative also decided to use more than 7 million catties of wheat as winter and spring revolving funds, and planned to purchase and sell 4 million square feet of native cloth, 1 million catties of cottonseed, 250,000 catties of grass hat braids, 100,000 reed mats, and cotton, soybeans, sesame, etc., and has already started purchasing. Chenliu Special District focuses on supporting the oil pressing industry and the transportation industry, followed by weaving, flour mills, papermaking, and brick kilns. Xin County organized charcoal burning, iron smelting, and iron sand panning. It is estimated that the county's seven iron factories can accommodate 3,000 odd jobs. The number of charcoal kilns has also increased from 120 to 250, and 16 lime kilns have been added. This not only solves the living problems of some people but also enlivens urban and rural trade.

    山东贸易合作部门收购各地山果土产组织副业战胜灾荒
    【本报讯】山东省人民政府及所属贸易公司、供销合作处及各地经济部门，目前正大力开展城乡贸易、收购土产、组织副业生产以战胜灾荒，若干地区并已获得相当成绩。省贸易总公司，为使工业品适应季节需要，除前已调拨大量物资下乡外，旬日来继续拨给鲁中南及渤海等地煤油七百五十余桶，红白糖四万斤，火柴近二千箱及毛巾、袜子、牙膏，各种色布日用物品等，约计值人民币十六亿余元。该公司为扶植各地火柴业生产，解决其原料困难，最近更分别拨给济宁、潍坊二地火柴原料硫化磷六千余斤，松香、亚铝华各千余斤，腊料子二千余斤及洋硝九千斤。益都、沂水、临朐等地，因连年战争与敌伪的长期封锁，致使当地特产山果、杏仁、核桃等销路停滞，省供销处为结合生产救灾，确定冬季任务就以大力收购山果为中心工作。益都、临朐、沂水、沂源、莒沂、淄博等地，为山东有名的特产区，仅益都、临朐两县年产杏仁即达十万斤，核桃六十万余斤，柿饼七十七万七千余斤，其他如著名的蜜桃、山楂片产量更丰。在战前当地农民山果收入即占其全部收入的百分之四十。此次供销处收购多系通过推进社与合作社以互订合同方式收购，据统计到去年十二月下旬为止，各县共收购了柿饼、核桃、楂片、乌枣等山果七十万一千余斤。连各公营企业在益都收购的三十余斤及私商收购的四十余万斤，合计共收一百四十五万三千余斤，每斤以一斤粮计，可以增加一百余万斤粮，目前该供销处尚在继续收购中。该处为保证农民售出山果后能买到日用必需品，并配合稳定物价，曾先后运往益都等地火柴二百七十余箱，高粱三十三万余斤，豆饼二万六千余斤，色布三七五匹，元豆三万三千斤，食盐十万斤及棉纱等。在收购中，该处并注意到巩固和发展合作社，吸收社员，扩大股金。一般社员均反映：“前几年山楂落在地下无人管，今年切切晒晒就变成钱”。
    该社在收购中仍然存在着若干缺点：如沂水、淄博两个推进社对此次收购山果意义，向群众说明不够，价格的掌握太机械。
    【又讯】在淮阳、陈留、新县等县人民政府及银行，为了即时组织灾区农民从事副业生产，曾拨大批粮款予以扶持，如人民银行淮阳支行即决定贷放杂粮五十七万五千斤，人民币一亿三千万元，扶植群众运输及其他手工副业。并派干部配合区乡干部，计划在淮阳组织车子一百辆，商水二百辆，沈邱一百四十辆，项城四十辆，鹿邑、太康六百辆，以运出该区棉花、芝麻、土布、香油、蒲席等农业特产及副产品，换回食盐、粮食、纸张等必需品，以沟通城乡物资交流。淮阳专区合作社并决定以七百余万斤小麦作为冬春周转资金，并拟购销土布四百万方尺，棉籽一百万斤，草帽辫二十五万斤，蒲席十万条及棉花、黄豆、芝麻等物，现已开始收购。陈留专区则着重扶植打油业及运输业，其次为编织、粉坊、造纸、烧窑等业。新县则组织烧炭、打铁、淘铁砂等生产，计全县七个铁厂能容杂工三千人。炭窑也由一百二十个增至二百五十个，并添了石灰窑十六孔。这样不仅解决部分人民生活问题，且活跃了城乡贸易。
