Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 9th: TASS Moscow, January 6th: The Labor News published on the 6th an article by Sherfka, the Indian representative to the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference and Secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress, on the struggle of the working class in India and Pakistan. The author points out that nearly 1.25 million industrial workers are united under the banners of the All-India and All-Pakistan Trade Union Congresses. They have launched a wave of strikes to oppose the combined forces of British imperialism, the Indian bourgeoisie, and feudal princes. Indian capitalists, with the full support of the government, have launched an offensive against the working people.

    The Nehru government and its provincial heads have begun to adopt open means of terror, imprisoning more than 25,000 democratic leaders and activists in the workers' movement. In Madras Province (southern India), not only the Communist Party but also all trade unions and other democratic groups have been banned. The Communist Party has also been banned in West Bengal, Indore (central India), and Hyderabad. The Communist Party, the All-India Trade Union Congress, and several other democratic groups are currently virtually illegal throughout India. The ruling group arrests and shoots people participating in rallies and marches in order to suppress the activities of democrats; they prohibit strikes, launch police searches, and confiscate progressive books. However, the strike movement is developing under the slogan of fighting against attacks on the living standards and democratic rights of the working people. All major sectors of industry have been paralyzed by strikes. Workers in the textile industry, the largest sector of Indian industry, are the vanguard of the strike movement.

    In some rural areas, the Nehru government has established concentration camps in the style of Hitler, and in these areas, peasants led by the working class are fighting for land. They want to distribute the land of landlords to landless peasants and agricultural laborers. Despite the government's use of retaliatory and brutal acts of terror, the number of strikes continues to increase. The author also pointed out that in the Telangana region, where a large-scale peasant uprising (involving five million people) occurred three years ago, the people's government is realizing the dreams and aspirations of Indian peasants - distributing the landlords' land to landless peasants and agricultural laborers. Despite the army's and police's terror measures, the peasants continue to successfully defend their hard-won victories.

    When discussing the basic tasks facing the All-India Trade Union Congress, the author stated: The most important thing is to help the unemployed, organize underground trade union activities, and unite millions of agricultural workers in the struggle for bread and land. But more important is to unite the ranks of the working class, because only by uniting the working class can a national democratic front be established. Sherfka concluded by saying: "Under the banner of the World Federation of Trade Unions, we will complete these tasks shoulder to shoulder with the entire democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union."

    谢尔凡卡在劳动报论述
    印工人英勇斗争
    当前基本任务是团结工人阶级争取面包和土地
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：劳动报六日发表出席亚澳工会代表会议的印度代表、全印职工大会书记谢尔凡卡论印度与巴基斯坦工人阶级斗争的专文。作者指出，将近一百二十五万产业工人，团结在全印及全巴基斯坦职工大会的旗帜下。他们掀起了罢工的浪潮，以反对英帝国主义、印度资产阶级和封建王公的联合力量。得到政府全力支持的印度资本家向劳动人民发动了进攻。
    尼赫鲁政府及其各省首脑已开始采取公开的恐怖手段，监禁了两万五千余民主领袖和工人运动的积极参加者。在马德拉斯省（印度南部），遭禁止的不仅是共产党，而且还有一切职工会及其他民主团体。共产党在西孟加拉、印度尔（印度中部）及海得拉巴也都遭到禁止。共产党、全印职工大会及若干其他民主团体，目前在印度全国实际上都是非法的。统治集团为了镇压民主分子的活动而逮捕和枪杀参加集会与游行的人民；他们禁止罢工，发动警察搜查，没收进步书籍等。但罢工运动正在为反对进攻劳动人民的生活标准及其民主权利而斗争的口号下发展。所有工业的主要部门已因罢工而瘫痪。印度工业最大部门纺织业的工人是罢工运动中的先锋队。
    尼赫鲁政府在若干乡村地区，仿照希特勒的方式，建立起许多集中营，而在这些地区里受工人阶级领导的农民，正在进行争取土地的斗争。尽管政府采用报复的和残酷的恐怖行为，罢工的次数仍然不断增加。作者并指出三年前发生大规模农民暴动（包括五百万人口）的台雷甘纳区，人民政权正在实现印度农民的梦想和愿望——把地主的土地分配给无地的农民和农业劳动者。尽管军队与警察实行恐怖措施，农民们仍然胜利地保卫着已得的胜利。
    作者论到全印职工大会所面对着的基本任务时称：最首要的是必须帮助失业者，组织地下职工会活动，将千百万的农业工人大众团结在争取面包和土地的斗争中。但更重要的是团结工人阶级的队伍，因为只有团结了工人阶级，才能够成立民族民主阵线。谢尔凡卡在结语中称：“我们将在世界工联的旗帜下，与以苏联为首的整个民主阵营，并肩地完成这些任务。”
