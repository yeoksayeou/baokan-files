Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 26th—Since the first Changsha Municipal People's Representative Conference was convened two months ago, representatives from all circles have actively assisted the Municipal People's Government in implementing the resolutions of the conference, ensuring the extremely smooth progress of all tasks. Regarding the restoration and development of industry and commerce, after the resolutions of the conference were conveyed by the representatives, some concerns that still existed among the industrial and commercial sectors regarding labor-management relations and taxation gradually disappeared. The phenomenon of dispersed and hidden capital gradually decreased, and itinerant merchants mostly converted to stationary merchants. Industrialists and businessmen scattered in Hong Kong, Guiyang, and other places have also returned one after another, some bringing back large quantities of raw materials. Some representatives participated in the Beggar and Refugee Relief Committee. The committee has repatriated more than 2,000 refugees to their hometowns and accommodated 1,400 beggars for production transformation. One-third of the committee's funds were raised by the representatives through solicitation. When paying taxes, the representatives from all circles participated in democratic appraisal and took the lead in paying, enabling Changsha to complete its tax revenue tasks in five days. In the work of purchasing public bonds, supporting the army, and supporting the front lines, the representatives from all circles also played an active role in promoting these efforts. Because the representatives can promptly convey the opinions of all levels, all measures taken by the Changsha Municipal People's Government are more in line with the demands of the city's people. For example, when prices in Changsha fluctuated in November last year, representatives from all circles, based on the opinions of the citizens, proposed five suggestions to the government, including tightening the currency supply. The government and the People's Bank immediately adopted and earnestly implemented these suggestions, causing prices to gradually stabilize. As for some suggestions that could not be implemented temporarily or should not be implemented, the government also promptly provided detailed explanations and answers to the citizens through the representatives. This spirit of the government being responsible to the people has greatly inspired the representatives' enthusiasm for assisting the government in its work.

    长沙市各界代表会议代表积极协助政府执行决议
    各项工作推进极为顺利
    【新华社长沙二十六日电】长沙市首届各界人民代表会议于两月前召开后，各界代表积极协助市人民政府实行各界人民代表会议的决议，使各项工作的推进极为顺利。在恢复和发展工商业方面，经过各界代表传达了会议的决议后，工商界在劳资、税收等问题上还存在着的一些顾虑即渐告消失，资本分散及隐藏的现象逐渐减少，行商多转为坐商。散居香港、贵阳等地的工商界人士，也都陆续归来，有的并带回大批原料。有些代表参加了乞丐难民处理委员会。该会曾资遣二千多难民回乡，收容一千四百名乞丐进行生产改造。该会的经费有三分之一是由代表们劝募来的。在缴纳税款时，各界代表参加了民主评议，并首先带头缴纳，使长沙市的税收任务在五日内即全部完成。在购买公债、劳军及支援前线等工作中，各界代表也都起了积极的推动作用。由于代表们能够及时地转达各阶层的意见，长沙市人民政府的一切措施因而更能符合于全市人民的要求。例如去年十一月间长沙市物价波动时，各界代表曾根据市民群众意见，向政府提出紧缩通货等五项建议，政府及人民银行立即采纳予以认真执行，使物价逐渐趋于平稳。至于一些暂时不能办或不应办的建议，政府也都通过各界代表及时向市民群众作详细的解释和答复。政府这种对人民负责的精神，更大大启发了代表们协助政府工作的积极性。
