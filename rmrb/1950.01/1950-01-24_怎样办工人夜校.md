    How to Run Workers' Night Schools
    Qi Chao
    Since the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, worker education has been actively developing. An important aspect of this is workers' night schools. Here are some scattered experiences from running workers' night schools in this city, for reference in other regions.
    Motivating workers to participate in learning requires some publicity and mobilization work. On the one hand, workers should understand the future and great mission of their class; on the other hand, it should be linked to the workers' own interests. Some places have adopted cultural grievance sessions (complaining about the hardship of illiteracy), which have been quite effective and are worth promoting.
    At the same time, explanations can also be made to the capitalists to dispel their concerns and make them understand that workers' learning of policies is helpful to improving production.
    Organizational work: Because the organizational form of trade unions tends to be organized by industry, workers' night schools must also be established separately according to different industries. Some districts gather different industries into one school according to workers' residential areas, but because their work, lives, and demands are inconsistent, they encounter great difficulties in teaching and cannot solve them.
    Running schools by industry is also something that must be gradually realized according to the development of the situation, rather than mechanically and quickly. If a single industry (such as the department store industry among store employees) is run, but the number of students is insufficient, or the trade union organization in that industry has not been established or is not sound, it can be run by a large industry (such as the store employee industry or porter industry, which includes several industries), and temporarily be the responsibility of the district work group. This method is now commonly used in various districts in the city.
    Everyone runs the school—as the number of learners gradually increases and the number of cadres relatively decreases, it is necessary to mobilize workers to run the school themselves, with everyone participating.
    Workers running their own schools, simply put, means selecting principals, academic affairs, and administrative directors from among the workers, and managing all administrative work in the school themselves. At the same time, strengthen the division of labor in the group, and set up mobilization (or liaison), cultural (or learning), and recreational officers as needed in the group to mobilize and supervise learning, consciously abide by learning discipline, carry out criticism and self-criticism, conduct democratic grading and organize extracurricular activities, and give play to the workers' enthusiasm and creativity, so as to educate themselves with their own strength. This does not mean that no cadre leadership is needed; on the contrary, it is necessary to strengthen leadership. Cadres should conduct work in a leadership manner under the principle of democratic centralism through meetings and reports. This method has been initially tested in some districts, but has not been widely applied, and further experience remains to be summarized in the future.
    Combining organizational work with educational work—during the preparation period before the establishment of the trade union, the study of revolutionary theory and policies in night schools will enhance the class consciousness of the working class, establish a sense of ownership, and recognize the role of the trade union, so as to cooperate in completing the initial organizational tasks of the trade union; after the establishment of the trade union, it is necessary to closely connect the workers with the trade union, so that the trade union can grasp the workers' ideological situation, so as to improve their political understanding through night schools.
    The role of the Party and the League—The Fifth District Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches importance to worker education, closely grasps the learning leadership of primary school teachers in the district, improves their awareness, and solves the problem of teachers in worker education in the district. League members have played an active leading role in serving everyone in extracurricular work such as mobile libraries, and have also motivated workers to learn.
    Leadership of cultural teachers—The number of worker students is gradually increasing, and cultural courses are constantly being added, requiring a large number of cultural teachers. According to the current situation, the source of general cultural teachers is mostly middle and primary school teachers and university and middle school students. They are enthusiastic about serving the working class; however, because they do not know enough about workers' lives, habits, emotions, and needs, they often need a period of exploration and learning. This requires propaganda and education leaders to strengthen contact with them, grasp the leadership, listen to teachers' reflections on the situation through forums or teacher joint meetings, provide suggestions for improvement, study how to improve work, and also strengthen their political education.
    Frequent inspection—This is one of the keys to the consolidation and improvement of night schools; especially in night schools with many people and few cadres, they mainly rely on teachers, which requires leading cadres to frequently check, understand the situation at any time, discover problems, and solve problems. This is especially necessary in night schools with a large number of people and high mobility.
    Establish a school system and move towards standardization—Around November of last year, the number of night school students in some districts gradually decreased and their morale was low. The main reason was that they only taught political courses, and the non-standardized learning period was too long. Workers said: "When will the study be over?" Objective development forces us to establish a regular school system, establish a working system, and improve worker education.

    怎样办工人夜校
    齐朝
    北京市各界代表会议以来，工人教育工作已在积极开展。其中重要的一项是工人夜校。这里仅将本市举办工人夜校的一些零星经验介绍出来，供各地参考。
    动员工友参加学习，是需要经过一番宣传动员工作的。动员时，一方面要使工人了解自己阶级的前途与伟大使命；一方面要联系到工人的切身利益，有的地方采用文化诉苦（诉不识字的苦）等方法曾收到相当效果，值得推广。
    同时，也可向资方进行解释，破除其顾虑，使之了解工人学习了政策，对生产改进是有帮助的。
    组织工作：因为工会的组织形式是趋向于按行业组织，所以工人夜校也就必须是按不同行业分别成立。有些区按工人住区集不同行业于一校，因为工作、生活与要求都不一致，教学上遇到很大困难，不能解决。
    按行业办学校，也是要按情况的发展逐步实现的，而不是机械的、速成的。如果按一个单一的行业（如店员行业中的百货业）办，而学生人数不够，或是该行业工会组织尚未建立或未健全时，可以按大行业（如包有几个行业的店员业、搬运业）办，而暂由该区工作组负责。这一办法，现在城内各区普遍采用着。
    大家办学校——学习人数逐渐增多，干部相对减少，这就要求发动工人自己办学校，大家办学校。
    工人自己办学校，简单说，就是在工人中选出校长、教务、事务主任等，自己管理学校中一切行政工作。同时加强小组的分工，在小组内按照需要设动员（或联络）、文化（或学习）、康乐等干事，动员与督促学习，自觉遵守学习纪律，开展批评与自我批评，展开民主评卷及组织课外活动等，发挥工人的积极性与创造性，作到用群众自己的力量教育自己。这并不是不需要干部领导；相反的，更要加强领导。干部应该通过会议汇报方式，在民主集中原则下有领导的展开工作。这个办法已在某些区作了初步的试验，但还未普遍应用，进一步的经验还待将来总结。
    组织工作与教育工作结合——在工会成立之前的筹备期间，通过夜校中革命理论与政策的学习，提高工人阶级觉悟，树立主人翁思想，认识工会的作用。以配合完成工会的初步组织任务；在工会成立以后，要密切工人与工会的关系，使工会能掌握工人思想情况，以便通过夜校，提高其政治认识。
    党与团的作用——中共五区区委重视工人教育，抓紧该区小学教员的学习领导，提高其觉悟，使该区工人教育中的师资问题获得解决。团员在流动图书馆等课外工作中起了积极带头为大家服务的模范作用，也带动了工人学习。
    文化教员的领导——工人学员日渐增多，文化课又在不断增添，需用大批文化教员。按现在情况，一般文化教员的来源多为中、小学教员及大、中学同学。他们富有为工人阶级服务的热忱；但因对工人生活、习惯、感情、需要等了解不够，常需要一个摸索学习时期。这就要求宣教领导同志与他们加强联系，抓紧领导，通过座谈或教员联席会议，倾听先生们反映情况，提供改进的意见，研究如何改进工作，同时也对他们加强政治教育。
    勤检查——这是夜校巩固与提高的关键之一；尤其在夜校多干部少的地方，主要依靠教员，那就要求领导干部勤检查，随时了解情况，发现问题，解决问题。尤其在人数多、流动性大的夜校，更须如此。
    建立学制走向正规——去年十一月间，有的区夜校人数逐渐减少，情绪低落，其主要原因是单纯教政治课，非正规化的学习时期过长了。工人说：“学到什么时候算完？”客观发展，迫使我们必须建立正规学制，建立工作制度，将工人教育提高一步。
