    Zhou Enlai's statement of January 8th, advocating that the United Nations expel the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnants, is a legitimate demand of the Chinese people that fully complies with the principles and spirit of the United Nations Charter. However, the sophistry of the representatives of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France during the Security Council's discussion of the Soviet proposal supporting Zhou Enlai's statement fully demonstrates that these countries have once again engaged in acts that undermine the United Nations Charter. Regardless of the tricks these representatives play, their arguments and justifications blatantly violate the provisions of the United Nations Charter, and in their sophistry, they even disregard the most basic standards of international law.

    In international affairs, to be a representative of a country and its people, one must have the country and people one represents. This is the most basic principle. At the same time, the people of any country have the right to express their will and determine their own government and representatives. Today, only the Chinese people's own government—the Central People's Government—has the right to send representatives to attend the various organs of the United Nations, while the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnants have long lost any legitimate qualifications.

    The United States and the representatives of some countries subservient to the United States are playing the so-called weapon of "recognition" to defend themselves. In fact, the current situation in the Security Council has already negated this point. Another excuse is the provision in the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council regarding the issue of "credentials" of representatives. Little do they know that the problem now is that, even though the Kuomintang reactionary remnants still give Jiang Tingfu credentials, and the credentials still contain the word "power," he can no longer represent the Chinese government and the Chinese people in the slightest. The Chinese government and the Chinese people have fundamentally denied his representative qualifications. He has no right to attend the Security Council, and the Security Council should drive him out.

    Now, the Central People's Government has appointed the representatives of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations, and Foreign Minister Zhou has sent a note to the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the Secretary-General, asking them to reply: when will the illegal representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnants be expelled, and when can the legitimate Chinese delegation attend the United Nations and participate in its work. The Chinese people unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, and the questions raised by Foreign Minister Zhou must be answered promptly. The Chinese people resolutely oppose acts of sabotage against the United Nations and will not allow the US imperialist bloc to continue to undermine the United Nations!

    反对破坏联合国的行为
    王铁崖
    周外长一月八日的声明，主张联合国开除国民党反动残余的代表，是中国人民完全符合联合国宪章原则与精神的合法要求，而在安理会讨论苏联支持周外长声明的提案时，美英法等国政府代表们的诡辩充分表现这些国家又一次做了破坏联合国宪章的行为。尽管这些代表们如何玩弄技俩，他们的主张和论据没有一点不显明违反联合国宪章的规定，他们在诡辩之中甚至连国际法的起码标准也都顾不得了。
    在国际上，作为一个国家及各该国人民的代表，必须有其所代表的国家和人民，这是最浅显的道理；同时，任何国家的人民有其表示自己意志，决定自己的政府和代表的权利，这是最基本的原则。今天，只有中国人民自己的政府——中央人民政府，才有权派遣代表出席联合国各种机构，而国民党反动残余的代表早已丧失任何合法资格。
    美国以及听命于美国的某些国家的代表们正在玩弄所谓“承认”的武器，以为自己辩护。其实，安理会的现况已经否定了这一点。另外的借口就是安理会临时程序规则的规定，即代表的“权力证书”问题。殊不知现在的问题是：尽管国民党反动残余还给蒋廷黻以证书，证书里还写着“权力”的字样，但他已丝毫不能代表中国政府与中国人民，中国政府与中国人民已经根本否定他的代表资格，他已毫无出席安理会的权利，安理会应该把他赶走。
    现在，中央人民政府已经任命中华人民共和国的出席联合国的代表，周外长已经照会通知联合国大会主席和秘书长，要求他们答复：何时开除国民党反动残余非法代表，合法的中国的代表团何时可以出席联合国并参加工作。中国人民一致拥护周外长的声明，周外长提出的问题必须迅速确定答复。中国人民坚决反对破坏联合国的行为，不能容许美帝国主义集团继续破坏联合国！
