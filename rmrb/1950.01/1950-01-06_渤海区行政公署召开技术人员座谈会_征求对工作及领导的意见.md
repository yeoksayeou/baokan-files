    [Report from this newspaper] The Bo Hai District Administrative Office of Shandong Province held a symposium for technical personnel from its affiliated departments before the New Year to solicit opinions from technical personnel in various departments on construction work and leadership, and to investigate and resolve difficulties encountered in their work. More than 40 people attended, including technicians, doctors, and specialized personnel from the industrial, agricultural, water conservancy, health, and veterinary departments. Heads of various offices, bureaus, and hospitals under the Administrative Office also participated. Attendees put forward many opinions on the work of various departments and on leadership, and proposed to strengthen learning and improve technology to devote themselves to construction work. Many people also proposed considering the establishment of organizations for the natural sciences. The Secretary-General of the Administrative Office, the Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, and the Director of the Industry and Commerce Department spoke successively, responding to the opinions raised by everyone and conducting sincere self-criticism. They explained that due to the administrative leadership's failure to better study and learn technology, some work plans were not practical or were wrongly formulated, resulting in waste of manpower and resources; the leadership of technical work comrades and the full utilization of everyone's role were not done well enough. Finally, based on the experience of the past year, the great significance of technology for various constructions was explained, encouraging everyone to strengthen the study of technology and politics, so that scientific technology and practical needs can be combined, and combined with the broad masses, to better serve the people.

    【本报讯】山东省渤海区行政公署于新年前召开所属各部门的技术人员座谈会，征求各部门技术人员对建设工作、对领导上的意见，并调查与解决工作中的困难问题。到会人员包括参加工业、农业、水利、卫生、兽医各部门的技师、医生以及各业专门人材四十余人。行署各处、局及医院等的负责人均参加。到会人员对各部门工作上、对领导上提出了许多意见，并提出要加强学习，提高技术，以便致力建设工作。有不少人又提出请考虑成立自然科学界组织的问题。行署秘书长、水利局长、实业处长等先后发言，分别答复大家提出的意见，并进行了诚恳的检讨，说明行政领导同志由于未更好的研究与学习技术，使工作计划有的不切合实际或订错计划，造成人力物力的浪费；对技术工作同志的领导与发挥大家的作用还做得不够。最后，并根据一年来的经验，说明技术对于各项建设的重大意义，勉励大家加强学习技术，学习政治，使科学的技术和实际需要结合起来，与广大群众结合起来，更好的为人民服务。
