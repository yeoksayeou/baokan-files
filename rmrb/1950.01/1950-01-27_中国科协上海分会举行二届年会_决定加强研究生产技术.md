The conference summarized the work of 1949. In the past six months, the association has greatly developed, with more than 1,300 members, a six-fold increase since the early days of Shanghai's liberation, and 24 branches have been established. The meeting decided that the central task for this year is to strengthen the connection between theory and practice, and to study production technology and production systems. At the same time, in order to cooperate with production, scientific education should be popularized so that science can be grasped by the broad masses of workers. The conference finally passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and expressed serious protest against the British imperialists' ban on the activities of the Hong Kong and Kowloon branches of the China Association for Science Workers.
