Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 15th: According to a TASS report from Rome on the 14th, the Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party recently issued a statement on the Italian government crisis, stating that the domestic situation in Italy has become more severe due to the government's failure to fulfill its promises, systematic infringement of democratic rights, and undermining of guarantees to implement thorough reforms stipulated in the constitution.

The Italian Communist Party believes that the current political line of the government must be changed. The leadership of the new government should no longer be entrusted to De Gasperi, and Interior Minister Scelba should be removed from office.

The Italian Communist Party demands the abandonment of the political and military obligations assumed in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the abolition of American control over Italy's foreign trade, and calls for the broad development of trade with the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe, and the People's Republic of China.

The Italian Communist Party demands land reform based on constitutional principles and the adoption of the plan initially drafted by the Italian General Confederation of Labour as the basis for improving the Italian national economic situation.

The statement finally urges all democratic elements in Italy to discuss the Communist Party's proposals and calls on the working people to defend these proposals as a necessary prerequisite for establishing the country's economic and political life on a sound foundation.
