    Developing Normal Financial Business
    Shanghai Private Banks and Firms Mostly Profitable
    [This newspaper dispatch] Shanghai's private banks and firms, under the correct leadership of the People's Government, have strictly banned speculation and eliminated illegal financial activities. The general business of banks and firms has become increasingly normal, and most have achieved profits. In the past, Shanghai's private banks and firms, on the one hand, wanted to escape the loss of currency value caused by the Kuomintang bandit gang's plundering inflation. On the other hand, because the heads of general banks and firms lacked a long-term vision, the annual business, even if reluctantly relying on speculative activities to have some profits, was extremely unstable. Before liberation this year, due to malignant inflation and prices jumping several times a day, the normal business of almost all banks and firms in the city was at a standstill. Apart from those who were unable to continue to resume business after liberation and planned to switch to other industries, the remaining banks and firms saw a surge in deposits after rectifying their business during the period of price stability in July and August. However, during this period, general industry and commerce had not fully recovered, so many banks and firms experienced difficulties in not being able to release deposits. After September, as industry and commerce gradually improved, general banks and firms actively cooperated with government policies, striving to guide idle funds into legitimate industrial and commercial undertakings to assist industrial and commercial development and economic prosperity. According to the average settlement results of various banks and firms for the three months of September, October, and November, most banks and firms generally had surpluses. Among the more than 180 private banks and firms in the city, excluding more than 40 whose details are unknown, 104 of the remaining 149 banks and firms had surpluses, with surplus amounts ranging from 50 million to 1 billion yuan, accounting for 69.8% of the total number of banks and firms. Five banks and firms broke even, accounting for 3.35%. Thirteen banks and firms, including those with unknown profit and loss and other banking associations, accounted for 8.7%. Twenty-seven banks and firms had losses, including closed banks and firms, accounting for 18.12%. According to the investigation results, the reasons for the losses of these banks and firms were nothing more than poor management, and some banks and firms had not changed their past wasteful practices, resulting in huge expenses and causing losses. In addition, several had been losing money before liberation.

    发展正常金融业务
    沪私营行庄大部获利
    【本报讯】沪市私营行庄，在人民政府正确领导下，严厉取缔投机，消灭非法金融业务，一般行庄业务已日趋正常，大部均获盈余。按过去沪市私营行庄，一方面为要逃避因国民党匪帮掠夺性的通货膨胀所造成的币值上的损失，他方面又因一般行庄负责人缺乏长久打算的远大眼光，致每年业务即使勉强靠投机活动而有若干盈余，但是基础极不巩固。在本年解放前，因通货恶性膨胀，物价一日数跳，全市行庄的正常业务几乎全部陷于停顿。解放后无力继续恢复营业而有计划地转营他业者外，其余行庄在七、八两月物价稳定时期、整顿业务后，存款数量激增。但这个时期一般工商业尚未全面好转，因之，许多行庄又发生存款无法放出的困难。九月以后，工商业逐渐步入佳境，一般行庄即积极配合政府政策，努力引导游资转入正当的工商事业，以协助工商业发展生产，繁荣经济。据各行庄九、十、十一三个月平均结算结果，大部行庄均普遍有盈余。在全市一百八十余家私营行庄中，除四十多家未详外，其余一百四十九家行庄有盈余的计一百零四家，盈余额均在五千万元到十亿元不等，占总行庄数百分之六九·八。盈亏平衡者五家，占百分之三·三五。盈亏不详者及其他银行公会等十三家，占百分之八·七。亏损者二十七家，包括停业行庄在内，占百分之一八·一二。据调查结果这几家亏损行庄，其原因不外：经营不善，和部分行庄还未改变过去浪费作风，以致开支浩大，造成亏损，还有几家系在解放前即一直有亏损。
