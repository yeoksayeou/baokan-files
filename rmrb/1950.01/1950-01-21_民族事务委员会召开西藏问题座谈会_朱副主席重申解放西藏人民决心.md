Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 20th. The Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government convened a symposium on the 18th of this month to discuss the Tibet issue with Tibetan democratic figures and intellectuals from various regions who have come to Beijing. Vice Chairman Zhu De and Secretary-General Lin Boqu of the Central People's Government attended to provide guidance. Vice Chairman Zhu reaffirmed the Central People's Government's determination to liberate the Tibetan people and explained the ethnic policies outlined in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During the symposium, Tibetan figures denounced the imperialists' conspiracy to invade Tibet and expressed their ardent desire for the swift liberation of Tibet. They unanimously stated: The imperialists' schemes to deceive and hoodwink the Tibetan people for many years are no longer feasible today. Due to the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the correctness of the Central People's Government's ethnic policies, the Tibetan people are urgently demanding liberation. Deputy Director Liu Geping of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, when discussing the imperialists' efforts to create so-called "Tibetan autonomy," stated: The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates that "regional autonomy should be implemented in areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities," but the autonomy referred to here is by no means the so-called "autonomy" of the imperialists. The genuine autonomy of the Tibetan people can only be obtained after the forces of imperialist aggression are driven out of Tibet. The so-called "autonomy" that the imperialists are vigorously promoting is a conspiracy to maintain their aggressive forces in Tibet. Therefore, the liberation of Tibet is the prerequisite for the genuine autonomy of the Tibetan people. After the symposium, a Tibet Issue Research Association was immediately established to conduct in-depth research work.

    民族事务委员会召开西藏问题座谈会
    朱副主席重申解放西藏人民决心
    【新华社北京二十日电】中央人民政府民族事务委员会本月十八日召集各地来京藏族民主人士、知识分子等座谈西藏问题，中央人民政府朱德副主席、林伯渠秘书长特亲临指导。朱副主席重申中央人民政府解放西藏人民的决心，并说明人民政协共同纲领中的民族政策。座谈中，藏族人士痛斥帝国主义侵略西藏的阴谋，热切要求迅速解放西藏。他们一致表示：帝国主义多年来欺骗蒙蔽西藏人民的勾当今天已经行不通了。由于中华人民共和国的成立以及中央人民政府民族政策的正确，西藏人民正迫切要求解放。民族事务委员会刘格平副主任谈到帝国主义极力制造所谓“西藏自治”时说：中国人民政协共同纲领中规定了“各少数民族聚居的地区，应实行民族的区域自治”，但是这里所指的自治绝不是帝国主义的所谓“自治”。西藏人民的真正自治是在把帝国主义的侵略势力从西藏驱逐出去以后才能获得的。帝国主义所以极力宣传的所谓“自治”，是阴谋借以保持其在西藏的侵略势力的。因此，解放西藏即为西藏人民真正自治的前提。座谈会后，当即成立西藏问题研究会，作深入之研究工作。
