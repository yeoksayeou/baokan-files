    Wuhan Private First Textile Factory Production Reaches Pre-War Levels
    [Report from our newspaper in Hankou] The Wuhan Private First Textile Factory, with the active assistance of the People's Government and the joint efforts of its workers, has seen its output increase month by month over the past six months. Its current daily output has exceeded 40% of pre-liberation levels, reaching the general level of the pre-War of Resistance against Japan period. The factory has more than 6,000 workers, 85,000 spindles, and over a thousand looms, making it the largest textile factory in the Central China region. Before liberation, the capitalists transported 15,000 bales of yarn stored in the factory to Guangzhou and embezzled the funds for 800 dan of cotton, owing the workers a month and a half's wages. However, the workers prioritized production, risking their lives day and night to protect the factory from destruction by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. However, due to the capital flight to the south and the exhaustion of raw cotton and coal, work had to be suspended. After the liberation of Wuhan, in order to restore and develop production and solve the workers' livelihood problems, the People's Government immediately assisted the shareholders remaining in Wuhan to convene meetings, adjust the organizational structure, and elect new directors, supervisors, and a general manager. The leadership structure was improved. The government also allocated 25,000 dan of raw cotton and 350 million yuan in loans as working capital. With the strong support of the government, the factory resumed operations in mid-June, and the cloth factory, which had been shut down for more than a decade, also partially resumed production. Over the past six months, under the leadership and support of the government, and through the efforts of the workers, various unreasonable feudal systems hindering production within the factory have been abolished. A collective contract has been signed with the factory, appropriately improving workers' lives and welfare, thereby enhancing workers' enthusiasm for production. Production efficiency has increased by 40% compared to March before liberation; raw materials have also been saved, with waste cotton reduced from 25% to 13% throughout the factory. Thanks to the efforts of the maintenance mechanics and the care of the workers, the thirty-year-old machinery has increased its yarn output from 0.45 pounds per spindle per day to 0.6 pounds. Currently, due to the rapid expansion of newly liberated areas and the peak season for cotton yarn, sales are very good. Labor and management have recently negotiated and are working hard to achieve a monthly yarn production of 4,500 bales.

    武汉私营第一纺织厂产量达到战前水平
    【本报汉口专讯】武汉市私营第一纺织厂，在人民政府积极扶助和职工共同努力下，半年来产量逐月上升，现日产量已超过解放前百分之四十，达到抗日战争前一般水平。该厂拥有职工六千多，纱锭八万五千个和上千部织布机，是华中地区最大的纺织厂。解放前，资方将厂内存纱一万五千件运逃广州，又贪污了八百担棉花的价款，积欠下工人一个半月的工资。但工人却以生产为重，为了防止蒋匪军的破坏，曾经冒着生命危险，不分昼夜保卫了工厂。但因资金南逃，原棉及烧煤告罄，不得已而停工。武汉市解放后，人民政府为恢复与发展生产，解决工人的生活问题，立即协助留汉股东召集会议，调整组织机构，选举新的董、监事及总经理。健全了领导机构。政府并先后拨给该厂原棉二万五千担及三亿五千万元之贷款，作为周转资金。经政府大力扶助下，该厂于六月中旬即行复工，停工十几年的布厂也部分开工了。半年来，在政府的领导和支持下，经过工人的努力争取，废除了厂内阻碍生产的各种不合理封建制度，和厂方订立了集体合同，适当地改进了工人生活和福利事业，因而提高了工人生产的积极性。生产效率较解放前三月份提高百分之四十；原料也节省了，全厂已由百分之二十五的废花减为百分之十三。由于保全部机匠的努力修整及工友的爱护，使三十多年的陈旧机器，由每天每锭出纱○·四五磅，增为○·六磅。目前由于新解放区的迅速扩大，且正值棉纱旺月，销路甚好。劳资双方最近已经协商，为争取达到每月产纱四千五百件而努力。
