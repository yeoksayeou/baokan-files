Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 23rd — The CCP Regional Committee of northern Anhui and the People's Government of northern Anhui, in the disaster-stricken area, are now mobilizing all their efforts to launch production for disaster relief. The region carried out a production for disaster relief campaign last year and achieved some results, but because the region suffered severe disasters, the disaster area is large, and the leading authorities underestimated the development of the disaster, the current disaster situation in the region is still very serious. Northern Anhui suffered from floods, hail, and insect plagues in the Yangtze and Huai River basins last year. The severity of the floods was unprecedented in the past twenty years. The autumn crops in the Huaibei area were completely submerged or only yielded 30%; the late autumn crops were sown and flooded three times, and some areas were even flooded four times. The disaster-stricken population in the entire region is 8 million (more than 4 million seriously affected), and the flooded farmland accounts for more than 50% of the total farmland. The disaster situation in the Suxian Prefecture is the most serious, with the disaster-stricken population accounting for 67% of the prefecture's 5.3 million people, and the disaster-stricken land accounting for 65.4% of the total farmland. After the complete liberation of northern Anhui last year, the CCP Northern Anhui Regional Committee and the Northern Anhui Administrative Office determined that production for disaster relief was the focus of their work at that time, and gradually implemented this policy in governments at all levels. Last November, the Central People's Government, the Northern Anhui Administrative Office, and the Northern Anhui Branch of the People's Bank of China allocated and loaned a total of 196.6 million catties of grain to implement work-for-relief projects, build embankments on the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, and repair inland rivers. According to incomplete statistics, as of last December, 200,000 laborers had participated in this water conservancy project. Last October, under the leadership and assistance of local Party and government organs, farmers in various places actively carried out crash wheat and vegetable planting, and achieved considerable success. The wheat planting area in Suxian Prefecture last year was 10.55 million mu, accounting for 60% of the total cultivated area in the prefecture. The wheat planting area in Anqing Prefecture last year was 1.03 million mu, exceeding the wheat planting area of the previous year by 255,000 mu, reaching one-third of the total cultivated area. After the Northern Anhui People's Representatives Conference passed the "Implement Production for Disaster Relief" and "Build Water Conservancy Projects" resolutions last December, and established the Northern Anhui Production for Disaster Relief Committee, the region entered a stage of vigorous production for disaster relief. In order to develop sideline production, the region loaned grain to establish native product purchasing companies and opened up transportation routes. Lightly affected areas, in addition to helping themselves, also supported severely affected areas. For example, Chuxian Prefecture allocated more than 15,000 catties of grain to support severely affected areas.机关部队和合肥、蚌埠The organs, troops, and factories, mines, and schools in Hefei, Bengbu, and the Huainan Mining Area enthusiastically launched a social mutual aid movement to save one or two liang of rice per day and donate clothing and raise funds to support the disaster areas. The Huainan Coal Mine workers alone contributed 350 million yuan in half a month. However, due to the severity of the disaster in northern Anhui, and the leading organs' underestimation of the development of the disaster, the production for disaster relief work was not elevated to an overriding position, there was a lack of specific organization and timely in-depth inspection, and the combination of emergency relief and production self-rescue was not achieved. In particular, in the Suxian Prefecture, which was more severely affected by the disaster, the policy of prioritizing production for disaster relief was not fully implemented, so that the disaster situation in the region continued to develop. Now, 360,000 people in the region have fled to other places to escape the famine, and it is estimated that more people will run out of food before the Spring Festival. In order to overcome the severe famine, the CCP Northern Anhui Regional Committee and the Northern Anhui Administrative Office have now mobilized all their efforts to carry out production for disaster relief work, and have allocated 1 million catties of emergency relief grain and 5 million catties of wheat bran and bean cake to provide emergency relief to the disaster-stricken people in the Suxian Prefecture; called on the Party and government organs and troops in the Northern Anhui region to continue to deeply launch the grain saving for disaster relief movement of one or half a liang of rice per person per day; and at the same time, dispatched more than 500 cadres to go to the severely affected areas to organize the disaster-stricken people to carry out production for self-rescue with all their strength. The disaster area comfort group jointly formed by the Northern Anhui organs also set off on the 9th of this month to go to the disaster area to assist in the work.

### 皖北灾情仍极严重  各界代表会议决议全力贯彻生产救灾  五百干部下乡组织灾民生产

    皖北灾情仍极严重
    各界代表会议决议全力贯彻生产救灾
    五百干部下乡组织灾民生产
    【新华社合肥廿三日电】灾情严重的皖北地区的中共区党委和皖北人民政府，现正动员全力展开生产救灾工作。该区去年曾经开展了生产救灾运动并已获得若干成绩，但因该区受灾很重，灾区面积很大，领导机关对灾情的发展也估计得不足等原因，该区目前灾情仍很严重。皖北去年一年来连遭江淮洪汛、雹、虫等灾。其中水灾之重为二十年来所未有，淮北地区秋禾全淹或只收三成；晚秋则三种三淹，部分地区竟连淹四次。全区受灾人口八百万（受灾重的四百余万），被淹田地达总田亩的百分之五十以上。其中以宿县专区灾情最重，受灾人口占该区五百三十万人的百分之六十七，受灾土地占总田亩的百分之六十五点四。去年皖北全境解放后，中共皖北区党委和皖北行署即确定以生产救灾为当时工作的重点，并将这一方针逐渐贯彻至各级政府。去年十一月中央人民政府、皖北行署和人民银行皖北分行曾分别拨、贷粮食共一亿九千六百余万斤，实行以工代赈，兴修江淮河堤和修治内河。据不完全统计，截至去年十二月参加此项水利工程的已有二十万民工。去年十月，各地农民在各地党政机关领导和帮助之下，积极进行了突击种麦和种菜，并获得相当大的成绩。宿县专区去年种麦面积一千零五十五万亩，达该区总耕种面积的百分之六十。安庆专区去年种麦面积一百零三万亩，超过前年种麦面积二十五万五千亩，达总耕种面积三分之一。在去年十二月皖北各界人民代表会议通过《贯彻生产救灾》、《兴修水利》两决议，并成立了皖北生产救灾委员会以后，该区乃进入大力生产救灾阶段。为展开副业生产，该区曾贷粮成立土产收购公司，开辟运输路线。各轻灾区除自救外还支援重灾区，如滁县专区曾拨粮一万五千余斤支援重灾区。各地机关部队和合肥、蚌埠两市及淮南矿区的工厂、矿厂、学校都热烈展开了每日节约一两米和捐衣募款支援灾区的社会互济运动，仅淮南煤矿职工半月所献即达三亿五千万元。但由于皖北灾情过重，领导机关又对灾情发展估计不足，未将生产救灾工作提高到压倒一切的地位，缺乏具体组织和及时深入检查，未把急救和生产自救相结合，特别是在灾情较为严重的宿县专区未能完全贯彻生产救灾为首要任务的方针，以致该区灾情仍继续发展，现在该区已有三十六万人逃荒他乡，据估计春节前将有更多的人断炊。为着战胜严重的灾荒，中共皖北区党委和皖北行政公署现已动员全力进行生产救灾工作，已拨急赈粮一百万斤和麦麸、豆饼五百万斤，对宿县专区灾民进行急救；号召皖北区党政机关、军队继续深入展开每人每日一两米和半两米的节粮救灾运动；同时并抽调五百余干部，分赴重灾区组织灾民全力进行生产自救。皖北各机关联合组成之灾区慰问团，亦已于本月九日出发前往灾区协助工作。
