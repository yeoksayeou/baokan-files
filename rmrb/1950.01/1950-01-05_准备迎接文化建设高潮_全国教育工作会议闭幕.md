Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 4th: The National Education Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government concluded on December 31st of last year. After several days of group meetings and discussions, Vice Minister Qian Junrui delivered a summary report on the morning of the 31st, and the closing ceremony was held at 2:30 PM, with Minister Ma Xulun delivering the closing address.

In his closing address, Minister Ma Xulun pointed out that the primary achievement of this conference was to enable the Central Ministry of Education to gain a relatively comprehensive understanding of the national education work situation. Secondly, the conference discussed the work plan of the Central Ministry of Education for the first half of 1950. Because each major task in this plan is closely related to the work in various regions of the country, the completion of these tasks will also solve some common and pressing problems in the educational work of various regions. Thirdly, several specialized issues of great significance were resolved, especially the issues concerning the establishment of the Renmin University of China, Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle Schools, and spare-time literacy schools. Minister Ma pointed out that the establishment of these types of schools clearly demonstrates the characteristics of New Democratic education, and educators across the country must earnestly and wholeheartedly cooperate to carry out these new construction projects. Minister Ma pointed out that the primary task of the entire country in 1950 is to strive for victory on the front lines, liberate all of China, and vigorously restore industrial and agricultural production. Under these conditions, the resources that the country is currently investing in education are already considerable. Minister Ma said: Difficulties exist. Educational workers across the country, regardless of whether they are from old or new areas, whether they are old or new cadres, must modestly learn politics and professional skills, overcome all difficulties, and strive to do a good job in 1950, in order to lay the foundation, accumulate strength, summarize experiences, and prepare for and welcome the high tide of cultural construction that will arrive before long, and strive to complete the historical task of New Democratic education construction.

    准备迎接文化建设高潮  全国教育工作会议闭幕
    【新华社北京四日电】中央人民政府教育部召开的全国教育工作会议已于去年十二月三十一日闭幕。该会在连日进行小组大会讨论后，于三十一日上午由钱俊瑞副部长作总结报告，下午二时半举行闭幕式，由马叙伦部长致闭幕词。
    马叙伦部长在闭幕词中，指出此次会议的首要成绩，是使中央教育部对全国教育工作情况有了比较全面的了解。其次是讨论了中央教育部一九五○年上半年工作计划。因为这个计划中每项重大工作，都和全国各地区工作有密切关联，这些工作任务的完成，也就解决了各地区教育工作中的若干共同的迫切问题。再次是解决了几个有重大意义的专门问题，特别是关于成立中国人民大学和工农速成中学、业余补习学校的问题。马部长指出：这几种学校的举办，显著地表示了新民主主义教育的特点，全国教育工作者必须认真地同心合力地来进行这几项新的建设工程。马部长指出：一九五○年整个国家的首要任务是争取前线的胜利，解放全中国和大力恢复工农业生产，在这种条件下，国家现在用于教育的力量已经不算小了。马部长说：困难是有的。全国教育工作者，不分老区新区，不论老干部新干部，都要虚心学习政治与学习业务，克服一切困难，争取把一九五○年的工作做好，以便打下基础，积蓄力量，总结经验，准备与迎接不会很久即将到来的文化建设高潮，为完成新民主主义教育建设的历史任务而奋斗。
