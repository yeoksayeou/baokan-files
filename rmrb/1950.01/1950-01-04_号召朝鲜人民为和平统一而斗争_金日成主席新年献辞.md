Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 3rd: Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, delivered a New Year's address to the Korean people on the night of December 31st. He first extended New Year's greetings to all the Korean people in the name of the Republic's government. He said that although national reunification was not achieved in 1949 due to the obstruction of the US imperialists and their running dog, the Li Seung-man (Syngman Rhee) clique, the strength of the entire nation had been mobilized, completely isolating the Li Seung-man reactionary government. The awakened people of North Korea overcame many difficulties to lay a solid foundation for national construction, successfully completing the first year of the two-year people's economic construction plan, thereby transforming the face of the Republic's northern half. In South Korea, despite the bloody rule of the US and Li, the people still took up arms and launched a heroic guerrilla movement. Workers, farmers, and even soldiers in the puppet army ignited the flames of uprising against US imperialism and Li Seung-man. He also said that the current combat task facing the Korean people is to strengthen the struggle against US imperialism and Li Seung-man, and strive to achieve the reunification of the motherland as soon as possible. The people of North Korea must raise their vigilance, strengthen the organs of people's power and the people's army, security forces, and security teams, to build a military, political, economic, and cultural base for a strong, unified, and independent country; and strive to complete the two-year people's economic construction plan to consolidate the country's economic foundation and improve the people's material and cultural life. The people of South Korea should hold high the banner of the Republic, more actively launch a solemn national salvation struggle, unite under the banner of the Republic regardless of party affiliation, belief, or class, and fight for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The guerrillas must further improve their combat effectiveness, consolidate and develop their units, strengthen their relationship with the people, and expand their scope of activities. Victory belongs to the Korean people.

    【新华社平壤三日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国部长会议主席金日成于十二月三十一日夜向朝鲜人民发表新年献辞。他首先以共和国政府的名义，向全朝鲜人民致新年的祝福。他说：一九四九年虽因美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮的阻挠，未能实现全国统一，但全国人民的力量，已经总动员起来，使李承晚反动政府完全陷于孤立。觉悟了的北朝鲜人民，为奠定祖国建设的坚强基础，克服了许多困难，胜利的完成了二年人民经建计划第一年的任务，从而使共和国北半部的面貌为之一新。南朝鲜虽然在美、李的血腥统治下，人民仍然手执武器，展开了英勇的游击运动。工人、农民，甚至伪军中的士兵，都燃起了反对美帝国主义和李承晚的起义烽火。他又说：摆在朝鲜人民当前的战斗任务，是要加强反对美帝国主义和李承晚的斗争，力求早日实现祖国的统一。北朝鲜人民要提高警惕性，加强人民政权机关和人民军队、警备队、保安队、以便建设一个有力的统一独立国家的军事、政治、经济、文化基地；努力完成两年人民经建计划，以巩固国家的经济基础，提高人民的物质文化生活。南朝鲜的人民，应高举共和国的旗帜，更积极地展开庄严的民族救国斗争，不分党派、信仰、阶层，一致团结在共和国的旗帜下，为祖国的和平统一而斗争。游击队员们要进一步提高自己的战斗力，巩固发展部队，加强与人民的关系，扩大活动范围。胜利是属于朝鲜人民的。
