    Liu Shuming of Fengtai Cement Component Factory
    Successfully Makes His Own Welding Rods
    [This newspaper] Fengtai Cement Component Factory's Youth League member Liu Shuming has painstakingly researched and successfully trial-produced his own welding rods. Welding rods are a necessary material for welding steel, but they are difficult to buy on the market and are expensive, which affects the cost of products. In order to solve the difficulty of welding rods, Liu Shuming, a worker in the steel bar department, was determined to study how to make them himself. At first, he used 30% lime and 70% soot, mixed with water and applied it to No. 8 iron wire, but it would fall off as soon as it dried and could not be used. Later, after many researches, he changed the ratio of raw materials, and finally mixed lime and soot in equal parts, and added water glue of suitable consistency (one kilogram of water glue can be used to make 30 kilograms of welding rods), and still applied it to No. 8 iron wire, and the experiment was successful. The self-made welding rods are simple to manufacture and easy to obtain raw materials. Each kilogram can save 4,800 yuan compared to buying them on the market, which is half the price. The Cement Component Factory uses at least 10 kilograms of welding rods every day. Now that the difficulty of the shortage of welding rods has been solved, the cost of products has been greatly reduced. Comrade Liu Shuming's great achievement proves that under correct leadership, the workers' profound potential wisdom and creativity have been unleashed, and any difficulties in all production undertakings can be eliminated and overcome.

    自制电焊条成功
    【本报讯】丰台洋灰筑件厂青年团团员刘树明苦心研究自制电焊条，现已试验成功。按电焊条是焊接钢铁的必要用料，但在市场上购买困难，价钱昂贵，致影响制品成本。为解决电焊条的困难，钢筋部门工作员刘树明下决心研究自造，最初他用三成石灰、七成煤烟、用水拌和后涂在八号铁线上，但是干燥后一触即掉，不能应用。后来又经过多次研究，改变原料配合比率，最后按石灰煤烟各五成，并加添稀稠合度的水胶（一公斤水胶可用制三○公斤电焊条）拌合后，仍然涂在八号铁线上，结果试验成功。自制的电焊条制法既简便，原料取得也容易，较市上购买者每公斤可省四、八○○元，便宜一倍。洋灰筑件厂每日至少要用一○公斤电焊条，现在既解决了焊条缺少的困难，并使制品成本大为减低。刘树明同志这种伟大成就，证明了在正确的领导下，工友们深厚潜在的智慧和创造能力已经发动起来，一切生产事业中的任何困难，都是可以被消灭和克服的。
