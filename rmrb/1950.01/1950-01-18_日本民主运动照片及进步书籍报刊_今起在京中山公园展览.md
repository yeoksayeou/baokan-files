    Exhibition of Photos of Japanese Democratic Movement and Progressive Books and Periodicals Opens Today in Beijing's Zhongshan Park
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Foreign Cultural Affairs Liaison Bureau of the Ministry of Culture has scheduled the "Exhibition of Photos of Japanese Democratic Movement and Progressive Books and Magazines" to be held in Zhongshan Park, Beijing, from today (the 18th) to the 20th. A preview was held on the 17th. The exhibition includes more than 100 photographs and more than 500 books. The photographs are divided into ten series, including those depicting the resistance actions of the Japanese people under the oppression of warlords and American imperialism. The seventh series, "Japanese Returnees," reflects how Japanese soldiers who received a new democratic education in the liberated areas of China brought the spirit of democracy back to Japan. The pictures also show them immediately swearing an oath to join the Japanese Communist Party organization after arriving in Japan. The tenth series, "Long Live the Friendship and Cultural Exchange between the Chinese and Japanese People," mostly depicts the excitement and courage given to Japanese progressives by the founding of the People's Republic of China, and also shows the Japanese people's respect for Chairman Mao and the Chinese writer Lu Xun. The books and magazines are divided into nine categories. Among those on Chinese issues are the Japanese translation of Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," as well as a selection of Chinese woodcuts, Lu Xun research, etc. The newspapers and magazines include the Japanese Communist Party's organs, "Akahata" and "Zen'ei," as well as the works of Kyuichi Tokuda, the secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, and various Japanese Communist Party propaganda pamphlets. Some survey forms and booklets are original manuscripts.
