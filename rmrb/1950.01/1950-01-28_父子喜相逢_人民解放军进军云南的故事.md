    Father and Son Reunited
    A Story of the People's Liberation Army's Advance into Yunnan
    On the highway in Niaoshi Town, the People's Liberation Army surged forward like a tide, pursuing the fleeing enemy. Wang Junqing, a veteran soldier in his forties from the Sixth Company of a certain regiment, was excitedly planning how to annihilate the enemy and make meritorious contributions along the way. Suddenly, he encountered a very familiar face and asked this young soldier in surprise, "Comrade! Are you called Wang Peilin?" "Ah! Dad! When did you get here?" The young soldier abruptly stood up from the backpack he was sitting on, rushed forward, and grasped his father's hand, speechless for a long time. Wang Junqing could hardly believe his eyes. He carefully examined his son's dark red, round face, which brought back painful memories of the past, and he couldn't help but shed tears. Peilin was captured by the Chiang bandits in 1948 while working as a dockworker in Yantai. At that time, he was bare-chested and his face was thin and black from hunger... Two months later, Peilin's mother died of grief, and Wang Junqing was also captured by the bandit army and forced into service... He couldn't bear to think about it anymore. Wang Junqing and his son, who had been separated for more than two years, never dreamed that they would be able to reunite, and that they would meet in their own ranks. The father and son poured out their past painful experiences, and the flames of revenge burned in their hearts. Suddenly, a burst of gunfire came from the front. "Peilin! Remember, the Kuomintang ruined our family, and the Communist Party reunited our family. Son! You must avenge your dead mother!" Wang Junqing waved to his son and rushed towards the direction of the heavy gunfire. The Guangxi campaign ended in victory. Due to his bravery in battle and his active work, Wang Junqing gloriously earned great merit. Two days before the advance into Yunnan, he ran to the company to write a letter to his son: "Peilin, my son: We are about to begin our advance into Yunnan. I hope you will not be half-hearted, work hard, and strive to make contributions for the people."
