Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: TASS, Prague, 12th: The broad masses of Czechoslovakia are enthusiastically supporting the telegram sent by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress last December to the parliaments of various countries. The telegram called for an immediate halt to wars and the arms race, the prohibition and destruction of atomic weapons, and an end to the execution of fighters for freedom in capitalist countries. The Czechoslovak Peace Committee has passed a resolution to hold mass rallies in the central areas of the republic during the second half of January and the first half of February, expressing full support for the Standing Committee's telegram. The first rally will be held in Prague on January 24.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: TASS, Helsinki, 11th: Representatives of the Finnish Peace Supporters Association have sent a letter to the parliamentary groups of Finland, calling for intensified peace efforts. The letter stated: The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress has called on the parliaments of all countries to defend peace. We, the peace-loving people of Finland, believe that friendship with the Soviet Union is Finland's best guarantee of peace. Therefore, effective measures must be taken to prevent the deterioration of Finnish-Soviet relations and to prevent Finland from being drawn into the vortex of international military conspiracies.

The Peace Supporters Association expects all parliamentary groups to urge the government to implement its foreign policy in the interests of Finland and in the spirit of peace.
