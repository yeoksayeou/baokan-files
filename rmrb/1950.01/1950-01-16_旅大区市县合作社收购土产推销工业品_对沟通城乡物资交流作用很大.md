[Reported by this newspaper] Under the leadership of the Party and the government, cooperative societies in various cities and counties of the Lüda area have achieved great development in recent years. They have grown from the original fourteen supply and marketing cooperatives, nine employee consumer cooperatives, and four mass consumer cooperatives in 1948 to today's thirty-six supply and marketing cooperatives, ten employee cooperatives, nine mass consumer cooperatives, and over one hundred and fifty cooperative stations. Therefore, they have played a certain role in connecting the urban and rural relationship in Lüda. In the past, various cities and counties relaxed the leadership of cooperative society work, resulting in some cooperatives being controlled by bad elements, engaging in corruption, embezzlement, and speculation, and collapsing. Since 1948, leaders in various cities and counties have begun to attach importance to the work of cooperative societies. First of all, they focused on organizing and equipping cadres, strengthened the leadership of cooperative societies, and successively studied the Northeast Bureau Agricultural Department's 1948 document "Summary of Agricultural Production in Northeast China and Tasks for the Coming Year," which clarified the importance of cooperative society work. They formulated development plans, progressing from small to large, from simple to complex. At the same time, they carried out the work of transforming and reorganizing old societies, overcoming the tendency of simply aiming for profit and focusing on supply and marketing business. As a result, they played a great role in connecting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. In the past year, they helped public stores, enterprises, and some private industrial and commercial enterprises sell industrial products worth a total of 860 million+ Kanto Yen (excluding daily necessities and necessities of life). In terms of selling agricultural products for farmers, according to incomplete statistics in the autumn, they purchased more than 130 tons of cotton, more than 1,900 tons of vegetables, and 223 tons of peanuts. The cooperative societies in Shuangdao, Tieshan, Longwangtang and other districts of Lushun City also helped fishermen sell more than 550 tons of fresh fish. They appropriately increased the prices of agricultural products, encouraging farmers' production enthusiasm. Due to the reduction in the prices of industrial products and the appropriate increase in the prices of agricultural products, the purchasing power of farmers was improved. Last year, the total value of goods sold by the cooperative societies reached more than 869 million Kanto Yen.

    旅大区市县合作社收购土产推销工业品
    对沟通城乡物资交流作用很大
    【本报讯】旅大地区各市县的合作社在党和政府的领导下，年来获得很大发展。从一九四八年原有的十四处供销社、九处职工消费合作社、四处群众消费合作社发展到今天的三十六处供销社，十处职工社，九处群众消费合作社，一百五十余处合作站。因此在沟通旅大的城乡关系上起了一定的作用。过去各市县放松了合作社工作的领导，致使有的合作社被坏分子把持，进行贪污舞弊投机倒把，而垮了台。自一九四八年以后，各市县领导上开始重视了合作社工作。首先注意有重点的组织配备了干部，加强了合作社的领导，又先后研究了东北局农业部一九四八年“东北农业生产总结与明年的任务”的文件，对合作社工作的重要性认识更加明确。订出发展计划，由小到大，由简单到复杂。同时进行了改造整顿旧社的工作，克服了以单纯营利为目的的偏向，而以供销业务为主。因而在沟通城乡物资交流上起了很大的桥梁作用。在去年一年内，帮助了公营商店、企业、部分私人工商业推销了工业产品总值达关东币八亿六千多万元（日用品及生活必需品不在内）。在给农民推销土产品上，据秋季不完全统计，共收购棉花一百三十余吨，蔬菜一千九百余吨，花生二百二十三吨。旅顺市双岛、铁山、龙王塘等区合作社，并帮助渔民推销鲜鱼五百五十余吨。适当地提高了农业产品价格，鼓励了农民生产情绪。由于工业产品价格的降低，及土产品价格的适当提高，提高农民的购买力。去年合作社共销货物价值达关东币八亿六千九百多万元。
