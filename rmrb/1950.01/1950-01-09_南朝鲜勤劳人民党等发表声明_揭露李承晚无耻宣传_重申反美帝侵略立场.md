Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th: The Central Committees of the South Korean Labor People's Party, Labor Masses Party, Social Democratic Party, People's Alliance, National Grand Alliance, and other political parties and organizations have recently issued statements exposing the Syngman Rhee puppet government's use of turncoats within these parties to conduct shameless propaganda in support of the Syngman Rhee government. The statements from each party unanimously expressed their firm support for the Fatherland Unification Democratic Front's struggle program against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, Syngman Rhee. They also unanimously pointed out that if individual members cannot withstand the test in the course of the struggle and defect to the reactionaries, they will be regarded as criminals who betray the motherland and the people, and their actions have nothing to do with their respective parties. In their statements, they reiterated their political stance, unanimously expressing their intention to continue fighting alongside all the people to drive out the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism and overthrow the reactionary rule of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime.
