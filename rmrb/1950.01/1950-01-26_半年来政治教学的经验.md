    Experiences in Political Teaching Over the Past Six Months
    Shijiazhuang Municipal No. 1 Middle School Political Class Teaching Group

    The most important progress we have made in political teaching this semester is: we can better connect with the actual thoughts of students; each teacher has ideologically clarified the need to overcome the boring and dogmatic nature of political class teaching and strives to better solve the actual ideological problems of students through political classes.

    We believe the following experiences have been relatively successful:

    I. For the teaching of theory and current affairs policies, simple tests should be conducted for the whole class or in small groups before and after lectures to understand students' understanding of the courses taught or not yet taught, as well as any vague or erroneous ideas they may have. This enables teachers to educate students by addressing the actual state of their ideological understanding when teaching new lessons or guiding them to review old ones.

    Initially, when the Education Bureau stipulated unified teaching of the CPPCC documents and the Common Program, because the school had previously held three large reports and the second and third grades had covered "On New Democracy," and the first grade was also going to cover it, the political teachers all felt it was too repetitive. Teaching the same thing over and over again did not attract students' attention. Later, someone in the third grade conducted a pre-lecture test on CPPCC issues during extracurricular time and discovered that students had many questions and confused ideas, such as "What is the difference between the CPPCC and the People's Congress?" etc. The political class teaching group collectively studied these questions and explained them to each class. As a result, the students paid close attention to the lectures and were very interested, feeling that this had solved the problems they wanted to know. The teachers not only dispelled their concerns before the lecture, but also felt that it was much richer in content than explaining according to the articles. Later, each grade and class continuously tried this method and discovered many more topics. Holding tests for the whole class resulted in too many papers and not enough time to read them. Therefore, the second-grade political teachers changed to conducting tests for one or two groups in a few minutes. For example, when explaining a certain issue, they would first test two groups and find that students had some misconceptions. The teacher's explanation would then focus on resolving these misconceptions. Later, some teachers used group tests to check students' acceptance of the taught courses during student discussions to guide students' review. For example, after the first grade covered the state-owned economy, students argued in discussions whether the state-owned economy was exploitative. The teacher then used this debate to guide the review. This method of whole-class or group testing or discussion has now been widely used in all grades and classes, making political class teaching more connected with the actual thoughts of students. Students believe that this not only urges them to preview and review, but also makes the taught materials more appealing.

    II. For the teaching related to ideology and consciousness, before lecturing, first have informal talks with some students in each class (preferably activists) and the grade-level teacher (must be a grade-level teacher who deeply understands the students' situation) to understand the students' current understanding of the issues to be discussed. Then, the teacher takes these vivid and concrete examples and elevates them to a principle height for explanation. After the explanation, give homework questions that connect with thought analysis and self-criticism. This targeted ideological education is also very effective.

    When the third grade taught youth self-cultivation, they had informal talks with some students before explaining each issue, collecting a lot of realistic materials. The teachers organized and summarized them before giving the explanation. For example, when talking about opposing selfishness, they first understood the current various manifestations of selfishness in the class and then criticized and explained based on these actual and specific examples. The students had a particularly deep understanding and asked for more political classes to help them solve their ideological problems. The homework questions after the explanation were also completely combined with reality, and the questions related to students' thoughts and self-criticism: for example, after finishing the mass viewpoint, the review questions were: "Examine what manifestations of detachment from the masses you have?" "Which student in the class is the most arrogant? What are his specific manifestations and how do the students react to him?" etc. The students reflected that although such homework questions were brain-consuming, they solved problems. When the first grade talked about intellectuals, the political teachers solicited opinions from the subject teachers and grade-level teachers to first have a general understanding of the specific manifestations of students' ideological characteristics. Then, based on the students' situations such as "not accepting criticism is democracy," "going out without asking for leave is freedom," and "losing heart when hitting a wall," they explained the shortcomings of intellectuals. In the past, most first-grade students felt that political classes were boring and tasteless; this time, the students all reflected that the lectures were good and they could remember them. This teaching method of understanding the situation through informal talks first, and then lecturing has been proven in practice to overcome dogmatism and connect with reality, and is also welcomed by students.

    III. When there are major changes in the ideological situation of the students in the class, promptly organize whole-class forums, small-scale informal talks, or mobilize students to raise questions, and then the political teacher summarizes and analyzes the students' ideological understanding and takes time to give a special explanation of these questions. This is the most effective way to solve students' ideological problems in a timely manner.

    For example, after the third-grade graduating class started school for a month or two, they saw that many of the previous graduates were still idle at home, and also saw that a batch of old liberated area students were transferred away from the school. As a result, the students' emotions fluctuated greatly, and they were all planning for their future "outlets," and were not at ease studying. When the political teacher discovered this situation, he organized two small-scale informal talks and spent a week explaining the "learning problem." He also contacted the grade-level teacher and the Communist Youth League comrades to conduct individual education for particularly uneasy students. As a result, the students' thoughts were cleared up and their emotions stabilized. Later, because three students were transferred away, there was a lot of discussion in the class, and two more whole-class forums on "graduation outlets" and "family marriage" were held. After each forum, there was a special explanation of the problems in the forum, and the students did not want to leave after listening. Once, just as a tug-of-war competition was about to begin, the students asked for a few more minutes of lecture before going to the competition.

    半年来政治教学的经验
    石家庄市立一中政治课教学小组
    本学期以来，我们在政治课教学上的最重要的进步是：能更加联系同学思想实际；每个教员在思想上都明确了要克服政治课教学的枯燥、教条，企求更好的通过政治课来解决同学的实际思想问题。
    我们认为比较成功的经验有：
    一、对理论与时事政策方面的教学，讲授前后要经常举行全班的或小组的简单测验，以了解同学对已讲或未讲课程的认识情况及有何种模糊或错误观念，使教员讲授新课或指导同学复习旧课时能针对同学思想认识的实际来进行教育。
    最初，在教育局规定统一讲授政协文献与共同纲领时，因为学校在以前曾集中做过三次大报告，二三年级又讲过新民主主义论，一年级也就要讲，所以政治教员都觉得太重复，老讲一样东西，提不起同学注意。以后，有人在三年级课外时间，进行讲课前的关于政协问题的测验，发现同学有许多疑问与糊涂观念，如“政协会与人代会有何不同？”等等。政治课教学小组共同研究了这些问题，并向各班讲解，这样一来，同学非常注意听讲，很感兴趣，觉得这才解决了他们自己想知道的问题；教员则不但解除了未讲前的顾虑，而且觉得比之根据条文讲解，内容丰富多了。以后各年级各班不断试用这个办法，又发现出很多题目举行全班测验，卷子太多，没时间看，于是二年级政治课教员就改为抽几分钟进行一两个小组的测验，如讲某一个问题时，就先测验了两个组，从中发现同学有些错误认识，教员的讲解就以解决错误观念为重点。以后有的教员为了指导同学复习，又运用小组测验在同学讨论中检查同学对已讲课程的接受程度。如一年级讲过国营经济后，同学在讨论中争论国营是否有剥削？教员就根据这争论来指导复习。这种全班或小组测验或讨论的办法，现已普遍运用到各年级、各班，使政治课教学更加联系同学思想实际，同学都认为这既能督促他们预复习，讲的材料又爱听。
    二、对于有关思想意识方面的教学，讲授前先和各该班部分同学（最好是积极分子）及级任教员（必须是深入了解同学情况的级任教员）漫谈，了解同学当前对将要讲的问题的认识，然后教员拿这些生动具体实例，提高到原则高度来讲解；讲解后，再出联系思想分析检讨的习题，这样对症下药的进行思想教育，效果也很好。
    三年级讲青年修养，每讲一个问题以前，都和部分同学漫谈一次，搜集许多现实材料，教员整理归纳后，再去讲解。如讲反对自私自利时，先了解了班里当前各种自私自利的表现，根据这些实际具体事例来批判讲解，同学体会得特别深刻，都要求多上几堂政治课，好给他们解决思想问题。讲解后出习题，也完全是结合实际，联系同学思想检讨的题：如讲完群众观点后，就出复习题：“检讨一下自己有些什么脱离群众的表现？”“班里同学谁最自高自大？他的具体表现和同学对他反应怎样？”等，同学反映：这样习题虽费脑筋，却解决问题。一年级讲到知识分子时，政治教员就征求各任课及级任教员的意见，把同学思想特点的具体表现，先作了一般的了解，然后根据同学“不接受批评是民主”“不请假出门是自由”“碰了钉子就灰心”等等情况，讲解知识分子的缺点。过去一年级同学大部分觉得政治课枯燥无味；这样一讲，同学都反映讲的好，能记住。这种先漫谈了解情况，再讲授的教学方法，已在事实中证明是能克服教条主义结合实际，也使同学欢迎的。
    三、当班里同学思想情况发生较大变化时，及时组织全班座谈会、小型漫谈或发动同学提问题，然后由政治教员总结分析同学思想认识，抽时间将这些问题作专门讲解，这样最能及时解决同学思想问题。
    如三年级毕业班开学后一两个月，见上届毕业同学还有不少在家中闲居，又见学校调走一批老解放区同学，于是同学情绪大为波动，都为将来“出路”打算，不安心学习。政治教员发现了这情况，就组织了两次小型漫谈会，用一周时间讲解“学习问题”，又和该班级任教员与党团工作同志连络，对特别不安心的同学，进行个别教育，结果同学思想搞通，情绪稳定下来。后来又因为调走三个同学，班里纷纷议论，又举行过两次全班的“毕业出路”及“家庭婚姻”座谈会，每次座谈会后，就专门讲解座谈会中的问题，同学都听得不愿下课。有一次正要进行拔河比赛，同学们要求多讲几分钟，再去比赛。
