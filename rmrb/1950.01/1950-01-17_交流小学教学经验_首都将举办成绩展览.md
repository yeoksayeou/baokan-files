    Exchange Elementary School Teaching Experiences
    Capital to Hold Achievement Exhibition
    [Our Newspaper's Report] To review the teaching achievements of elementary schools in the city, enable schools to exchange work experience, and strengthen the connection between schools and student families, the Municipal Education Bureau, following the elementary school Chinese language demonstration teaching, will hold an exhibition of each school's achievements. Yesterday (16th) morning at 9:00 AM, Director Weng Dujian specifically convened principals of central elementary schools, and the heads of the Culture and Education Sections of suburban districts to study relevant implementation matters. The meeting decided: (1) The principle of the exhibition content is to be concise and refined, focusing on exhibiting various experience summaries and typical introductions, school introductions, school work plans, etc. (2) During the process, each school must identify a dedicated person to be responsible for organizing student and parent visits, patiently providing necessary explanations, and widely collecting opinions from all sides, thereby discovering problems and inspecting their own work. (3) Each school will jointly form an evaluation committee with the Education Bureau to conduct a summary at the end of the exhibition; each school must also separately make a serious summary of its own unit, as part of the term work summary. (4) The exhibition dates are scheduled for the 7th and 8th of next month. Each district will hold its own exhibition. Schools with fewer exhibits can be grouped together, while schools with more can be divided into several large groups.

    交流小学教学经验
    首都将举办成绩展览
    【本报讯】为检阅市内各小学教学成果，使各校交流工作经验，并密切学校与学生家庭的联系，市教育局继举行小学国语观摩教学后，将举办各校成绩展览。昨（十六）日上午九时，翁独健局长特召集各中心小学校长郊、区文教科长等研究有关进行事项。会议决定：（一）展览内容以少而精为原则，有重点的展览各种经验总结与典型介绍，学校介绍、学校工作计划等。（二）在进行中，各校必须找出专人，负责组织学生和家长参观，耐心的进行必要的讲解，广泛地搜集各方面的意见，进而发现问题，检查本身工作。（三）各校会同教局共同组成评议会，于展览完毕时进行总结；各校并须分别认真作出本单位的总结，作为学期工作总结的一部分。（四）展览日期预定为下月七、八两日。各区分别举行。学校少的可集中展览，多的可分几个大组进行。
