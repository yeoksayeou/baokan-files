Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 13th. The Ningbo Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau's arbitration on the dismissal dispute at the former US Embassy Club has been concluded. The case had been delayed for three months due to the employer's lack of sincerity in negotiation, with more than fifteen consultations and mediations by both labor and management and the Labor Bureau. The dispute arose in early September of last year when Robert H. Soule, the person in charge of the board of directors of the former US Embassy Club, notified 45 employed workers, including He Rongzong, on September 7th, 29th, and October 3rd that the club was about to close and they intended to dismiss the workers. The workers then elected five representatives, including He Rongzong, to negotiate the dismissal issue with Soule and his unofficial representatives, demanding that dismissal fees equivalent to two to three months' salary be paid according to the dismissal agreements of the former US Embassy and the former US Information Service. However, the employer showed no sincerity and repeatedly changed representatives, delayed the process, and shirked responsibility. The employer's representative, Mair, even falsely claimed that the name "former US Embassy" was a printing error on the signboard and refused to pay dismissal fees according to the former US Embassy dismissal agreement. On October 1st, Mair even gathered the workers, confined them indoors for individual talks, and forced them to sign agreements immediately, but failed because the workers refused. Afterwards, the employer used the excuse that the workers had carelessly broken wine bottles and should not be paid dismissal fees. Therefore, although the labor side negotiated continuously, no results were achieved. On October 8th, the employer, Soule, suddenly published a statement in the newspaper announcing his departure and asking relevant parties to settle all outstanding cases and debts in China within five days. After seeing the announcement, the labor side believed that the dismissal dispute had not been resolved and requested the Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau to postpone issuing exit permits. On November 1st, an American named Beacon, claiming to be the chairman of the club, declared to the Public Security Bureau that the labor side's request to the Public Security Bureau to postpone issuing exit permits had formally rejected negotiations, causing the negotiation to fall into a stalemate. At the same time, the employer also failed to comply with the People's Government's laws and decrees and failed to pay the workers their due wages, placing the workers' lives in extremely difficult circumstances, attempting to force the workers to submit and divide them, but the workers remained unyielding. On November 23rd, American Soule, seeing that his conspiracy had failed, sent Beacon to the Foreign Affairs Office, claiming that he was willing to invalidate the previous statement and reopen negotiations. On the 25th, the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions sent a representative to join the workers' representatives and the employer to negotiate dismissal fees, year-end bonuses, vacation pay, and wages during the dispute period, but no agreement was reached due to the employer's cunning. The preparatory committee of the General Trade Union then submitted the case to the Nanjing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau for mediation. After receiving the case, the Labor Bureau immediately ordered both parties to the dispute to await arbitration. Subsequently, the Labor Bureau, the Foreign Affairs Office, and the preparatory committee of the General Trade Union sent a total of five representatives to form an arbitration committee, which conducted arbitration based on current laws and regulations and the specific circumstances of both parties, deciding that the employer should pay each of the 45 workers, including He Rongzong, a dismissal fee equivalent to one and a half months of actual salary and the actual salary due during the dispute period, and pay the workers a year-end bonus according to the old practice of the former US Embassy Club (vacation pay was included in the dismissal fee and it was decided not to pay it separately). At that time, the arbitration committee also announced that if either party was dissatisfied with the arbitration, they could notify the Labor Bureau within five days of receiving the arbitration document and request a court ruling. American Soule went to the Foreign Affairs Office on December 15th to collect the Labor Bureau's notice, stating that he was willing to accept the arbitration, and the dispute was thus concluded. Soule paid all outstanding amounts and left Nanjing on the evening of December 20th of last year.

    宁前美大使馆俱乐部解雇纠纷
    经劳动局仲裁获解决
    【新华社南京十三日电】宁市人民政府劳动局对前美国驻华大使馆俱乐部解雇纠纷实行仲裁已获得结果。该案曾由于资方缺乏协商诚意，拖延达三月之久，曾经劳资双方协商和劳动局的调解前后在十五次以上。争议发生于去年九月初旬，前美国大使馆俱乐部董事会负责人美侨苏乐（Robert H·Soule）在九月七日、二十九日及十月三日先后通知雇用工人何荣宗等四十五人，该俱乐部即将停办，欲将工人解雇。该部工人即推选何荣宗等五位代表，与苏乐及其非正式代表就解雇问题进行谈判，要求应按前美国大使馆及前美国新闻处解雇协议，发给相等于工资两个月至三个月的解雇费。但资方毫无诚意，曾迭次更换代表，拖延时间，推诿责任，雇主委托人麦尔竟诡称前美国大使馆之名称系招牌印制之误，拒绝按前美国大使馆解雇协议发给解雇费。十月一日，麦尔并召集工人关在室内进行个别谈话，迫令工人立即签字，因遭劳方拒绝未成。之后，雇主复借口工人不慎打破酒瓶，不应发给解雇费。因此，劳方虽与之连续协商，但仍无成果。至十月八日，雇主当事人苏乐忽登报声明离境，请关系人于五日内向其清理在华一切未了案件及债务事项。劳方见报后，认为解雇纠纷尚未结果，乃呈请市人民政府公安局缓发出境证。延至十一月一日，有美侨贝肯，自称该俱乐部董事长，竟向公安局申明谓：由于劳方呈请公安局缓发离境证而正式拒绝谈判，使协商陷入僵局。同时雇主亦未遵照人民政府法令，发给工人应得之工资，陷工人生活于非常困难境地，企图逼使工人屈服分化，但工人始终不屈。至十一月二十三日，美侨苏乐鉴于阴谋不遂，乃遣贝肯至外侨事务处声称愿将以前申明作废，重开谈判。二十五日市总工会筹委会派代表一人会同工人代表与雇主当事人就解雇金、年终奖金、代假金及争议期间之工资等进行谈判，但仍因雇主方面狡猾而未获得协议，总工会筹委会乃将此案转呈南京市人民政府劳动局调解。劳动局接得此案后，即令争议双方听候仲裁。接着，劳动局、外侨事务处、总工会筹委会共派代表五人，组成仲裁委员会，依据现行法令及双方具体情况进行仲裁，决定由雇主当事人发给何荣宗等四十五名每人一个半月实际工资之解雇费及争议期间应得之实际工资，并按前美国大使馆俱乐部之旧例发给工人年终奖金（代假金已包括解雇费内，决定不另发给）。当时，仲裁委员会并宣布双方或任何一方对仲裁如有不服，可于接到仲裁书五日内通知劳动局，呈请法院裁判。美侨苏乐于十二月十五日至外侨事务处领取劳动局通知书时，表示愿服仲裁，纠纷遂告结束。苏乐于付清应付款项后，已于去年十二月二十日晚离开南京。
