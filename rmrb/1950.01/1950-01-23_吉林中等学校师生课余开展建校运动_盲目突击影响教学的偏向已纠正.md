(From our Jilin Correspondent) Since last year, secondary schools in Jilin Province have been carrying out school construction work. Teachers and students have been using their spare time to improve the learning environment by doing it themselves. At the same time, they have been making and creating teaching aids, collecting specimens, collecting lost equipment, improving teaching, and enriching equipment in combination with teaching.

The school construction work began in the spring of last year. The first step was to improve the learning environment. At that time, Provincial No. 1 Middle School combined this with the sanitation movement. Teachers and students used their spare time to dig soil and transport sand to repair and pave the campus, and to remove garbage accumulated for more than ten years since the puppet Manchukuo period. Later, they built a large playground with a diameter of 100 meters and planted more than 1,000 trees, laying the foundation for the campus. After that, teachers and students from middle schools in various places successively improved the learning environment by themselves, making the schools look brand new inside and out. Changchun Normal School, Girls' Middle School, No. 2 Middle School, No. 3 Middle School, and No. 5 Middle School built complete walls, with a total length of about 4,500 meters. Changchun Normal School, High School, No. 1 Middle School, No. 3 Middle School, No. 4 Middle School, and No. 5 Middle School leveled approximately 20,000 square meters of playgrounds. Panshi County Middle School also collected and dug up more than 10,000 pieces of discarded bricks and tiles from the ground to repair two classrooms, ten kang-beds, and repair the damaged school buildings.

Secondly, schools have been making and creating teaching tools. For example, Jilin Municipal Middle School teachers and students used their vacation time to collect 200 kinds of plant specimens, more than 100 kinds of mineral specimens, and 46 kinds of animal specimens from the outside of the city. At the same time, they made 670 charts, mathematical instruments, and models. Changchun Municipal No. 2 Middle School used waste and scraps to make a variety of teaching aids: such as using glass containers to make storage batteries; and converting ordinary radios into wireless telegraphs. They also created an overhead projector and an enlarged reflecting mirror, which can enlarge and reflect cells and pictures in their original colors onto a white wall in a dark room, solving the problem of having too few mirrors for too many people. They also built a small meteorological station, which can measure humidity, temperature, air pressure, precipitation, wind speed, and wind direction. In experiments, they also created a water power generation model and a mobile motorized vehicle. Jilin City Middle School and Huade Middle School used paper pulp, white flour, and water glue to make geography models. Jilin High School, Dunhua County Middle School, Panshi County Middle School and other schools combined teaching with the manufacture of a large number of charts. At the same time, teachers and students from various schools collected and donated lost instruments and medicines to enrich school equipment. Up to now, according to statistics from 22 secondary schools in Jilin and Changchun cities and eight counties: about 40,000 instruments, specimens, models, charts, etc. have been made, collected, and donated, including more than ten microscopes, five telescopes, two balances, as well as anemometers, voltmeters, planimeters, plane tables, organs, thermometers, electrolyzers, coolers, water meters, and some valuable chemical medicines.

There were also deviations in the school construction work: Many schools blindly rushed, affecting teaching. Some schools were extravagant and wasteful, and deviated from the needs of teaching. Some schools made crude specimens and charts in order to hold exhibitions, which became waste after the exhibition. In addition, some schools exceeded the principle of voluntariness in mobilizing teachers and students to donate equipment, forming a burden on teachers and students. The Jilin Provincial Department of Education discovered these deviations and corrected them in a timely manner. It also instructed all schools that future school construction work must be carried out in the long-term, researching the situation of each school, according to the requirements of the curriculum standards, combining teaching and using spare time to make teaching aids, so as to help students' learning and gradually enrich school equipment.

    吉林中等学校师生课余开展建校运动
    盲目突击影响教学的偏向已纠正
    【本报吉林通讯】吉林省各中等学校，去年起进行了建校工作，师生利用课余亲自动手，改造学习环境，同时结合教学自制和创造教学用具，采制标本，收集散失的器材，改进了教学，也充实了设备。
    建校工作于去年春开始，首先是改造学习环境，当时省立一中结合卫生运动，师生利用课余挖土运砂，修铺校院，并清除伪满以来积存十余年的垃圾；以后又修筑了一个直径百公尺的大操场，植树千余棵，打下了校园的基础。其后各地中学师生，相继亲自动手改造学习环境，把学校内外整理一新；长春师范、女中、二中、三中、五中等校并自筑很完整的围墙，总计长约四千五百公尺；长春师范、高中、一中、三中、四中、五中共平操场约两万平方公尺；磐石县中学并搜集和从地下挖出废弃砖瓦万余块，修铺两个教室、十条炕，并补修了曾遭破坏的校舍。
    其次，各校又纷纷自制和创造教学工具。如吉林市立中学，师生利用假中到城外采集植物标本二百种，矿物标本百余种，动物标本四十六种；同时自制图表、数学仪器、模型等六百七十件。长春市立二中利用废物和零碎材料，自制多种教学用具：如利用玻璃容器自制蓄电池；改装普通收音机为无线电报机。并创造了实物幻灯和扩大反射镜，在暗室中能把细胞和画片原色原样扩大反射到白墙上，解决了镜少人多的困难；又自建小型气象台，能作湿度、温度、气压、降水量、风速、风向等测量；在实验上又创制了水力发电模型，活动摩电车等。吉林市中，怀德中学等用纸浆、白面、水胶自制地理模型；吉林高中、敦化县中、磐石县中等校结合教学制造了大批图表。同时各校师生并收集，献纳散失的仪器、药品，以充实学校设备。到目前为止，据吉林、长春二市和八个县二十二个中等学校统计：自制、收集、献纳各种仪器、标本、模型、图表等约达四万件，其中有显微镜十余台，望远镜五个，天秤两个以及风速计、电压表、测积器、平板仪、风琴、温度计、电解器、冷却器、水表和一部分贵重化学药品。
    建校工作中也产生了偏向：很多学校盲目突击，影响教学。有的学校铺张浪费，脱离教学的需要。有的学校为了举办展览会，粗制滥造一些标本与图表，展览后成了废物。还有些学校在发动师生献器材中，超过了自愿的原则，形成师生的负担。吉林省教育厅发现这些偏向后，均已及时纠正。并指示各校今后的建校工作，必须在长期工作中，研究各校情况，按课程标准的要求，结合教学，利用课余来进行自制教学用具，使有助于学生的学习，并逐渐充实学校设备。
