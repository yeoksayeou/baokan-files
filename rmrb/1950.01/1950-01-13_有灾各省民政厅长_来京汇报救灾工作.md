    Provincial Civil Affairs Chiefs from Disaster-Stricken Areas Come to Beijing to Report on Disaster Relief Work
    [From Our Newspaper] In order to understand the disaster situation and to guide the production and disaster relief work in various regions, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government has separately summoned the civil affairs chiefs of nearby disaster-stricken provinces to Beijing to report. Currently, Li Jihuan, Civil Affairs Chief of Hebei Province, and Sun Zhaohuan, Civil Affairs Chief of Pingyuan Province, have completed their reports, and Zhang Junxuan, Civil Affairs Chief of Shanxi Province, is in the process of reporting. According to the reports, Hebei Province has a more planned approach to sideline production and has signed detailed contracts with state-owned trade production, which has solved the problem of product sales. Civil Affairs Chief Sun of Pingyuan Province personally led an inspection team to disaster areas to investigate and guide the work, bringing together typical examples of success and failure in disaster area work to guide the overall effort. These methods are worthy of reference for all regions. However, how to make disaster relief work comprehensive and in-depth, and how to implement the disaster relief guidelines, remains a common issue that all regions should pay attention to. Various reporting materials will be organized and published later.
