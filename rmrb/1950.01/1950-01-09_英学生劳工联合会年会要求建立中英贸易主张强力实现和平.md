    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: TASS, London - The British Student Labor League held its annual meeting here. On the 4th, the final meeting of the annual meeting passed a resolution celebrating the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and demanding that Britain establish full trade relations with the new China. The annual meeting passed another resolution criticizing the existing conditions in the colonies and expressing serious concern over the recent refusal of European colonial countries to allow the United Nations to investigate the regions under their rule.
    Ms. Jacobs, Secretary of the League, made a concluding speech stating: "Our most important task in 1950 is to campaign for the election of a government that implements socialist policies. We demand a socialist government that stands with peace-loving people all over the world and withdraws from the war camp led by the American ruling class. This requires increased trade with the Soviet Union, the People's Democracies, and the People's Republic of China, and an end to Britain's dependence on the dollar. Only by solving Britain's problems in a socialist way can the people's living standards be improved."  Mr. Pritt, the Chairman of the League and an independent Labor Party member of Parliament, declared: "We are not begging for peace, but we are forcibly achieving peace. Only those who themselves do not go to war want war."

    英学生劳工联合会年会要求建立中英贸易主张强力实现和平
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：英国学生劳工联合会在此间举行年会。四日，年会的末次会议通过一项决议，欢庆中华人民共和国中央人民政府的成立，并要求英国与新中国建立完全的贸易关系。年会通过另一决议，批评殖民地的现存状况，并对欧洲殖民国家最近拒绝联合国要求调查它们统治下的地区一事，表示严重的关切。
    联合会秘书雅科布斯女士作总结发言称：“一九五○年中我们最重要的任务，就是进行选举执行社会主义政策的政府的运动。我们要求一个社会主义的政府，这一政府要和全世界爱好和平的人民在一起，而退出美国统治阶级所领导的战争阵营。这就要增加和苏联、人民民主国家和中华人民共和国的贸易，并结束英国对美元的依附。只有用社会主义的方式解决英国的问题，才能改进人民的生活水平。”联合会主席独立的工党议员普里特宣称：“我们不是乞讨和平，而是要强力实现和平。只有那些自己不去打仗的人才要战争。”
