    Last Year: Overfulfilled the Annual Production Plan More Than a Month Ahead of Schedule
    All Employees of Tianjin Steel Plant
    Report Production Achievements to Chairman Mao
    This Year: Total Output to Increase More Than Twofold Compared to Last Year
    [This newspaper reported] With victorious and joyful feelings, all employees of the Tianjin Steel Plant reported to Chairman Mao the achievement of exceeding the annual production plan by 25 percent in 1949; at the same time, they also proposed a plan to increase output by 3.3 times in 1950. The original letter is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:
    Under your wise leadership, we have been liberated and, with the attitude of masters, completed the work that would have taken two and a half years under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in four months and nine days—that is, repairing the Martin furnace and successfully producing steel! We completed the 1949 production task one month and two days ahead of schedule, and by the end of the year, we had exceeded the annual production task by 25 percent. From the time we started producing steel to the present, the average monthly output is 4.9 times that during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries.
    From May to December, we reduced the cost of steel ingots by 44 percent. Respected Chairman Mao: Under your leadership, the People's Liberation Army followed your instruction to "advance the army," defeated the reactionaries, and all of China is about to be completely liberated. We steelworkers must resolutely follow your instruction to "increase production by an inch" and strive to increase the steel production of our plant to 3.3 times that of 1949 in this victorious 1950.
    We believe that under your wise leadership, nothing can stop us from moving forward, and nothing can stop the victory of the Chinese people!
                                  All Employees of Tianjin Steel Plant
                                      Signed by Jia Yafu et al., 905 people
                                          December 30, 1949

    去年：提前月余完成全年生产计划
    天津制钢厂全体职工
    向毛主席报告生产成绩
    今年：总产量要比去年提高两倍多
    【本报讯】天津制钢厂全体职工以胜利欢欣的心情，向毛主席报告一九四九年超过完成全年生产计划百分之二十五的成绩；同时并提出一九五○年提高产量三点三倍的计划。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    在你英明的领导下，我们得到了解放，以主人翁的劳动态度，在四个月零九天的时间内，完成了国民党反动派统治时期两年零半个月才能作到的工作——这就是修复马丁炉，胜利出钢！我们提前一个月零两天，完成了一九四九年的生产任务，到年底已超过了全年生产任务的百分之二十五。我们从出钢到现在，每月平均产量等于国民党反动派统治时期的四点九倍。
    我们从五月到十二月，使钢锭成本降低了百分之四十四。敬爱的毛主席：在你的领导下，人民解放军遵从你“军队向前进”的指示，打垮了反动派，全中国眼看就要全部解放，我们钢铁工人更要坚决遵从你“生产长一寸”的指示，在这个胜利的一九五○年，争取把我厂制钢产量提高到一九四九年的三点三倍。
    我们相信在你英明的领导下，没有任何东西能够阻挡我们前进，没有任何东西能够阻挡中国人民的胜利！
                                  天津制钢厂全体职工
