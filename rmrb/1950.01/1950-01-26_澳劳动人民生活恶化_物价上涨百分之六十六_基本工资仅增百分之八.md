    Australian Laboring People's Lives Worsen
    Prices Rise by Sixty-Six Percent
    Basic Wages Increase by Only Eight Percent
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 24th] According to a TASS report from Sydney on January 22nd: An official statement released this week proves that the living conditions of Australian laboring people are rapidly deteriorating. Compared to 1939, the prices of clothing and footwear increased by 57% last year, the prices of basic food increased by 52.8%, and the costs of transportation, fuel, electricity, and all public utilities almost doubled. The cost of living increased particularly sharply after the federal government partially lifted price controls in 1948 and after the devaluation of the Australian pound last year.
    While prices generally rose by 66%, basic wages increased by only 8%. Due to the continuous rise in prices, Australian big businesses gained a total of 900 million Australian pounds in net profits, interest, and rent in 1949.

    澳劳动人民生活恶化
    物价上涨百分之六十六
    基本工资仅增百分之八
    【新华社北京二十四日电】据塔斯社悉尼二十二日讯：本周发表的官方声明，证明澳大利亚劳动人民的生活情况正在迅速恶化中。与一九三九年相较，去年衣服和鞋袜的价格增加百分之五十七，基本粮食价格增加百分之五十二·八，车费、燃料、电费及所有公用事业的费用，几乎都增加一倍。在一九四八年联邦政府部分取消物价管制之后，以及在去年澳大利亚镑贬值之后，生活费用增加尤烈。
    物价一般上涨了百分之六十六，而基本工资仅增加百分之八。由于物价的不断上涨，澳大利亚大企业在一九四九年净获得的利润、利息和租金，共为九亿澳大利亚镑。
