Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th. The National Stevedores' Union Congress opened in Beijing today. A total of 96 representatives from stevedores' unions in 49 major cities across the country, and three representatives from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, totaling 99 people, attended. Among the guests were leading members of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and Ye. Yi. Kuznetsov and others from the Soviet Trade Union delegation. The congress first elected a presidium of thirteen people including An Lifu, Ouyang Zirun, Tang Huan, Niu Qingbo, Yao Guoqing, Ji Hao, Huang Yutian, Wei Yan, Geng Yiying, Qiao Guansheng, Zhou Fenglin, Su Xing, and Zhu Dishi. An Lifu, the executive chairman, pointed out in his opening speech: The main tasks of this congress are: First, to discuss and study the thorough elimination of feudal oppression, exploitation, and fragmentation in the dock transport and loading and unloading industry, to achieve smooth flow of goods and rational transportation. Second, to elect the National Committee of the Chinese Stevedores' Union. Subsequently, Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke, calling on stevedores across the country to strengthen unity, work hard to learn culture and technology, thoroughly eliminate the headman system, and complete the stevedoring tasks in the high tide of China's economic construction. Liu Zijiu, Minister of Culture and Education of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said in his speech: Today, our stevedores, like other workers, have undergone a fundamental change in their social and political status, and have become the leading class and masters of the country and society. We can freely use our own labor to create our future happy lives. However, because the Kuomintang's remnant bandits have not been completely eliminated, the feudal exploitation system that oppressed and exploited our stevedores in the past has not been eliminated in many places, the mess left over from the Kuomintang's reactionary rule in the past has yet to be sorted out, and some stevedores still have guild ideas, low cultural and technical levels, backward handling tools, and trade unions have not been universally organized, etc. Therefore, the current life of our Chinese stevedores is still in an extremely difficult state. Therefore, the current task of the National Stevedores' Union organization is first to fully utilize the strength of our stevedores and the People's Government to thoroughly eliminate those feudal forces that still oppress and exploit our stevedores, educate workers to overcome gang ideas, expand and consolidate the trade union organizations of stevedores, and suggest to local people's governments to establish stevedoring companies, and on behalf of the workers, sign collective contracts with stevedoring companies, establish labor cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, gradually improve our transportation tools, carry out labor insurance work for the death, injury and disability of stevedores, strengthen cultural and technical education, formulate labor discipline, and establish a new labor attitude.

    全国搬运工会代表大会开幕
    将讨论彻底消灭封建制度等问题
    【新华社北京二十八日电】全国搬运工会代表大会，今日在北京开幕。共到全国四十九个主要城市的搬运工会代表九十六人，及全国总工会代表三人，共九十九人。在来宾中，有中华全国总工会负责人和苏联工会工作者代表团叶·易·库滋涅佐夫等。大会首先选举安力夫、欧阳祖润、唐桓、牛清波、姚国卿、纪浩、黄玉田、魏焉、耿益盈、乔关生、周凤麟、苏星、朱迪时等十三人为主席团。执行主席安力夫于致开会词时指出：这次代表大会的主要任务为：第一、要讨论研究彻底消灭码头运输装卸事业中的封建的压迫、剥削和割据，达到货畅其流、运输合理的目的。第二、要选举中国搬运工会的全国委员会。继由中华全国总工会朱学范副主席讲话，他号召全国搬运工人加强团结，努力学习文化技术，彻底消灭把头制度，完成中国经济建设高潮中的搬运任务。中华全国总工会文教部部长刘子久于讲话中说：今天我们搬运工人也与其他的工人群众一样，社会政治地位起了一个根本的变化，已成了国家社会的领导阶级与主人，我们可以自由地用我们自己的劳动创造我们将来的幸福生活。但是因为国民党残余匪帮尚未完全肃清，过去压迫剥削我们搬运工人的封建剥削制度在许多地方尚未消灭，过去国民党反动统治时所遗留下来的烂摊子尚待整理收拾，加之一些搬运工人尚存在着行会思想，文化技术水平不高，搬运工具落后，工会也没有普遍地组织起来等等原因，所以目前我们中国搬运工人的生活还是处于异常困难的状态之中。因此，全国搬运工会组织的当前任务，首先就是充分运用我们搬运工人自己与人民政府的力量，彻底消灭那些现在仍然压迫、剥削我们搬运工人的封建势力，教育工人克服行帮思想，扩大与巩固搬运工人的工会组织，向各地人民政府建议建立搬运公司，并代表工人向搬运公司订立集体合同，建立劳动合作社与消费合作社，逐渐改善我们的交通运输工具，举办搬运工人的死伤残疾的劳动保险工作，加强文化技术教育，订立劳动纪律，树立新的劳动态度。
