Establish Production and Disaster Relief Committee
Lead Disaster Victims in Draining, Planting Wheat, Repairing Dikes, Opening Mountains
Develop Various Sideline Productions in Transportation and Textiles

Since the continuous rainstorms in late August of last year caused a disaster, the provincial leadership organs have attached great importance to it. The provincial government has repeatedly instructed the special districts and counties to carry out rescue and resettlement, and has formulated specific production and disaster relief plans. At the end of October, it also sent special cadres to the disaster areas to inspect and guide the work. Production and disaster relief committees have been established in the disaster areas and neighboring areas, absorbing the participation of the corresponding level of the Chinese Communist Party committees and mass organizations to jointly lead the production self-rescue of the vast number of disaster victims and mobilize the people in non-disaster areas to provide support. After more than three months of struggle, the following achievements have been made:

(1) Draining and Planting Wheat: Under the leadership of local governments, the people in the disaster areas have actively engaged in blocking breaches, opening canals, draining water, and building dams. Of the 3.28 million mu of flooded land in the disaster areas, 71% of the land has been drained. Through mobilizing mutual assistance and borrowing rice, and using methods such as human-powered plows, the difficulties of manpower and animal power have been resolved. By having disaster victims lower their living standards, preserve seeds, and appealing for friendly loans, and providing seed loans to 10% of the extremely difficult households, the seed difficulties have been resolved. More than 1.8 million mu of drained land has been planted with wheat, which is a great victory in the struggle against the threat of long-term famine.

(2) Through the method of providing work as a form of relief, disaster victims are mobilized for production self-rescue. In the counties along the Yellow River, a huge number of disaster victims were mobilized to participate in dike repair, mountain opening, and stone transportation. Other counties mobilized disaster victims to participate in grain transportation. In the eight counties in the above-mentioned flood-affected areas, the wages and food obtained by the disaster victims have been at least 3.5 million jin. This has played a significant role in strengthening the masses' determination for production self-rescue and stopping the passive exodus to escape famine.

(3) Mobilizing and organizing the masses to engage in various sideline productions is a decisive link in overcoming the famine. This mainly relies on mobilizing the masses to build on the existing production base and production activities, promoting the idea of "relying on the mountains for food" and "relying on the water for food," and starting from small things. For example, Gaozhang Village in Shouzhang County can organize all men, women, young and old in the village into dozens of sideline activities such as cotton spinning, dike construction, grain grinding, firewood picking, manure collection, and transportation, achieving a situation where there are no idlers in the village. Among the 140,000 disaster victims in Shouzhang County, 80% have been mobilized into production activities. In solving the capital problem, the main reliance is on using the existing financial and material resources of the disaster victims, emphasizing turning dead money into live money, turning means of subsistence into production capital, and turning people feeding livestock into livestock feeding people. Therefore, there have been methods such as converting firewood and furniture into production, conducting friendly lending, transporting goods on credit, labor-capital cooperation for profit sharing, and collectively feeding livestock for transportation. At the same time, the cooperative's ordering and credit business, and bank loans, provide some support to those who are truly in difficulty. There are difficulties in the sales of products, but the method to overcome them is mainly to use the diversity and decentralization of sideline production to mobilize the masses to widely find outlets. For a large number of slow-selling products, cooperatives and trade departments are used to purchase and promote them. For example, the mat stations, fish stations, grass stations, and manure yards set up by cooperatives in Yutai, Shouzhang, Liangshan, and Jiaxiang counties have directly solved the sales problems for tens of thousands of people.

(4) Establishing production and disaster relief committees at all levels in non-disaster areas, and calling on and specifically organizing the masses in non-disaster areas to resettle, provide relief to, and help disaster victims in their production is a direct and powerful support to the masses in the disaster areas. At present, a large number of disaster victims (estimated at more than 300,000) who have fled due to collapsed houses and difficulties in making a living in the disaster areas have mostly been properly resettled. Through the "a handful of rice, a pound of vegetables" movement among the masses in non-disaster areas, some relief has been obtained, and production support has been given. As a result, many disaster victims have been engaged in independent production or cooperative production with the local masses in non-disaster areas, and have established friendly relations.

(5) Practicing economy and austerity to overcome the famine in the disaster areas. Economy not only reduces consumption in a passive way, but it also has the positive effect of transforming means of subsistence into production funds. For example, some disaster victims in Shouzhang have reduced their daily food ration to six liang per person, and the surplus grain has been turned into production funds. Disaster victims in Liangshan and other counties have also collected large amounts of tree leaves, vegetable leaves, and sweet potato leaves, hundreds of jin per household. This also plays a significant role in overcoming the famine.

Overcoming Cadre's Fear of Difficulties and Almsgiving Mentality is a Prerequisite for Leading Production Self-Rescue

Due to the achievements made, the masses in the plain disaster areas have begun to move from a chaotic situation of passive panic and blindly fleeing famine to a path of production self-rescue with greater confidence. However, these achievements were achieved after a hard ideological struggle. When disaster relief began, there were two phenomena among the cadres. One is the firm production viewpoint, realistic plans, and mass line style. Opposed to this are the serious almsgiving mentality, unrealistic plans, and the bureaucratic style associated with them. The struggle between these two aspects runs through every specific issue. The wrong viewpoints and practices, manifested in the issue of draining and planting wheat, is the failure to actively lead the masses in draining and preventing floods, empty calls about difficulties, regarding seed loans as the only content of leadership, failing to specifically organize the masses to solve the difficulties of manpower and animal power shortages, failing to inspect and promote seed loans, and focusing purely on key points. Manifested in the aspect of providing work as a form of relief is the lack of attention, organization, and active contact with economic departments, and even the formation of the view that mobilizing disaster victims is a burden due to poor organization, and the unwillingness to use them on the pretext that disaster victims skimp on work and cut corners. In leading sideline production, there is a failure to investigate and analyze, a blind emphasis on difficulties, reliance on large amounts of grain and loans, a failure to start from small things on the existing foundation of the masses, and the formulation of empty plans. In solving problems such as production and sales, the positive creativity of the masses is not valued, but instead, one follows behind a part of the masses, only sees the negative aspects, is frightened by difficulties, and follows the tail of the masses. As for the negative rejection of organizing support from the masses in non-disaster areas and calling for economy, simply resettling and providing relief, or only issuing orders without specific inspection, organization, and promotion, these phenomena are also concrete manifestations of this error. These erroneous viewpoints and practices are a huge obstacle to the implementation of the production and disaster relief policy. At the beginning, due to the relatively widespread existence of this phenomenon, the work in most disaster areas of Pingyuan Province was delayed for a month, resulting in huge losses.

    建立生产救灾委员会
    领导灾民排水种麦修堤开山  开展运输纺织各种副业生产
    自去年八月下旬霪雨成灾后，省级的领导机关即极度重视，省府就一连数次指示各专县进行抢救安置，并且拟出了具体的生产救灾方案，十月底又专派干部前往灾区检查指导，在灾区及邻近地区普遍建立了生产救灾委员会，吸收同级中共党委及群众团体参加，共同领导广大灾民的生产自救，和动员非灾区人民予以支援，经过这三个多月的奋斗已经获得了如下成绩：
    （一）排水种麦：在各地政府领导灾区人民堵口、开渠、排水、打坝积极行动下，在水灾区三百二十八万余亩水淹地中，已有百分之七十一的土地把水排出，并经过发动互助借米，人拉耧等办法解决了人畜力困难，通过灾民自己降低生活，保存种籽，及号召友谊借贷，和对百分之十的极端困难户予以贷种，解决了种籽困难之后，已有一百八十余万亩水脱地种上麦子，这是与今后长期灾荒威胁作斗争的一个巨大胜利。
    （二）通过以工代赈方式，发动灾民生产自救。在沿黄河县份，动员了巨大数量的灾民参加修堤、开山、运石，其他县份则动员灾民参加运粮。在上述水灾地区八个县中，灾民获得的工资粮至少已有三百五十万斤。这对坚定群众生产自救，停止往外消极逃荒，起了很大的作用。
    （三）发动与组织群众进行各种各样的副业生产，是战胜灾荒的决定的一环。这主要是依靠发动群众在原有生产基础与生产活动上，发扬“靠山吃山”“靠水吃水”，从小处搞起。例如寿张县高掌村就能在纺棉、打堤、磨粮、拾柴、拾粪、运输等几十种副业活动中，把全村男女老少全部组织进去，作到了村无闲人。寿张全县十四万灾民中，已有百分之八十在生产中活动起来。在解决资金问题上，主要是依靠使用灾民现有的财力物力，强调变死钱为活钱，变生活资料为生产资本，变人养牲口为牲口养人。因而也就出现了折变柴草、家具投入生产，进行友谊借贷，赊运货物，劳资合作分红，伙喂牲口搞运输等办法；而同时则以合作社的订货、赊运业务，与银行贷款，给真正困难者以部分支持。在产品销路上存在困难，但克服办法主要是利用副业生产的多样性与分散性，发动群众广泛的找寻出路。对于大量的滞销产品，则透过合作社与贸易部门予以收购及推销。如鱼台、寿张、梁山、嘉祥等县合作社所设的席站、鱼站、草站、粪场等，便直接解决了数万人的产品销路问题。
    （四）在非灾区同样建立各级生产救灾委员会，号召与具体组织非灾区群众对灾民进行安置、救济与帮助其生产，这是对灾区群众的一个直接的有力的支援。目前因房屋倒坍，灾区谋生不易而逃出之大批灾民（约计三十余万），已大部分得到了适当安置。在非灾区群众间一把米一斤菜的运动下，已得到了部分救济，并给以生产上的支持，因之有不少灾民已在非灾区从事独立的或与当地群众合作的生产活动，并建立了友谊关系。
    （五）在灾区实行节约渡荒。节约不仅在消极方面减少消耗，而且它具有着变生活资料为生产资金的积极作用，如寿张灾民有的已把每人每日食粮降低到六两，节余粮食变成生产资金。又如梁山等县灾民则大量采集树叶、菜叶、红薯叶，一户数百斤。这对渡荒也有很大作用。
            克服干部害怕困难和恩赐观点是领导生产自救的先决条件
    由于这些成绩的取得，已使平原灾区群众由消极恐慌盲目逃荒的混乱局面，开始较有信心的步入生产自救的道路。但这些成绩的取得，是经过了艰苦的思想斗争的。开始进行救灾时，在干部间曾存在着两种现象。一种是坚定的生产观点、实事求是的计划与群众路线的作风，与此对立的，便是严重的恩赐观点，脱离实际的计划及与之相连系的官僚主义作风。这两个方面的斗争，贯串到每一个具体问题上。错误的观点与作法，表现在排水种麦问题上，便是不积极领导群众排水防水，空喊困难，把贷种问题视为唯一领导内容，不具体组织群众解决人畜力缺乏的困难，对贷种不检查、不推动，单纯重点主义。表现在以工代赈方面，是不重视、不组织、不向经济部门主动联系，甚至由于组织不善，形成征调灾民视为负担，以及借口灾民偷工减料，不愿使用。在领导副业生产方面，不调查、不分析、盲目强调困难，仰赖大批贷粮贷款，不从群众现有基础上从小处作起，制订空头计划。在解决生产销路等问题上，不重视群众的积极创造，而跟在一部群众后面，只看消极方面，为困难所吓倒，当群众尾巴。至于在组织非灾区群众的支援及号召节约上的消极拒绝、单纯安置救济，或只下命令不作具体检查组织推动等现象，也是这种错误的具体表现。这些错误的观点与作法，是贯彻生产救灾方针的巨大障碍。在开始时，由于这种现象较为普遍的存在，曾使平原省大部灾区的工作迟滞了一个月，形成了巨大损失。
