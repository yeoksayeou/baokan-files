    Qingdao's Foreign Trade is Active
    Imports and Exports Increased Last Month
    Various Places Collect Feathers in Preparation for Large-Scale Export
    [This Newspaper's Report] Since the beginning of winter, Qingdao's foreign trade and entrepot trade have become increasingly active. Since the establishment of the Joint Transportation Division of the Trust Department of the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China in Qingdao Port on November 1st of last year, in order to rapidly professionalize trust business and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the bank established joint transportation stations in Jinan and Qingdao. Qingdao's import and export trade has further developed, and many special local products such as tung oil from the inland areas are transferred through Shanghai, Hankou, and other places for export from Qingdao. According to statistics, imported materials from Hong Kong, North Korea, and other places in December were nearly 3,000 tons, exceeding November by more than 26.6 percent. These mainly included diesel oil, lubricating oil, cotton, rubber, and newsprint. Other chemical raw materials such as caustic soda were also significant. Exports last month were nearly 8,000 tons, exceeding November by more than 19.4 percent. The main goods were tung oil, menthol, peppermint oil, straw hats, ramie, etc. Other items included seafood, vegetables, soybeans, soybean cakes, dried fruits, and egg products.
    [Another Report] According to importers in Tianjin and other places, they have recently received frequent telegrams from abroad requesting large-scale orders for Chinese feathers (chicken feathers, chicken down, duck feathers, duck down, etc.). The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, in order to collect these materials, which have long been neglected by the Chinese people, to promote exports, earn foreign exchange, and increase people's income, has notified governments at all levels to pay attention to collection. By mid-December of last year, large quantities had been concentrated in Chahar and northern Anhui. In northern Anhui, Hefei alone had purchased more than 200,000 jin. Currently, the overseas market for feathers is improving, and merchants in Tianjin and other places are purchasing in the Beijing-Tianjin area and sending peddlers along the Jinpu and Jinghan railway lines for collection.

    【本报讯】入冬以来青岛对外贸易及转口贸易均日渐活跃。按青岛港口自去年十一月一日中国人民银行上海分行信托部联运股成立后，该行为使信托业务迅速走向专业化，并促进城乡内外物资交流，即在济、青两地设立联运分站，青岛进出口贸易更见开展，内地桐油等特产，经沪、汉等地转青出口者甚多。据统计十二月份自香港、朝鲜等地进口物资约近三千吨，超出十一月份百分之二六·六强。其中以柴油、滑机油、棉花、橡胶、白报纸等为主，其他如烧碱等化工原料亦不少。出口物资上月近八千吨，超出十一月份的百分之一九·四强。货品以桐油、薄荷脑、薄荷油、草帽、苎麻等为大宗，其他尚有海产品、蔬菜、大豆、豆饼、干水果、蛋品等物。
    【又讯】据天津等地进口商反映，月来常接国外电讯，欲大批订购我国羽毛（鸡毛、鸡绒、鸭毛、鸭绒等）。中央人民政府贸易部，为搜集此等向为国人所不重视之物资输出，争取外汇，增加人民收入，曾通知各级人民政府注意收集。至去年十二月中，察哈尔及皖北各地均已大量集中，皖北单合肥一地就已收购达二十余万斤。目前羽毛国外市场转佳，天津等地商人，已在京津一带收买，并派小贩沿津浦、京汉两线进行收购。
