	Grain from All Regions Continuously Supplied
	Guaranteeing Food for Shanghai Citizens
	[Report from this newspaper] In the past ten days, large quantities of grain have been transported to Shanghai from various regions, ensuring the food supply for Shanghai citizens. Among them, the first batch of 660 tons of rice from the Northeast in support of Shanghai arrived in mid-January. The second batch of 9,060 tons started to be transported to Shanghai a few days ago. In order to increase the grain supply and guarantee the food supply for citizens before and after the Spring Festival, the East China Grain Bureau has decided to transfer 300 million jin (approximately 2 million shi, enough to meet Shanghai's needs for three months) of rice from Jiaxing, Songjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Nantong, Kouan, Wuhu, Hangzhou, and other places to Shanghai. This batch of rice started to be shipped at the beginning of this month, and in the past week, the daily arrival of rice in Shanghai has often been over 6 million jin. According to the Grain Bureau's estimate, 140 million to 200 million jin of rice can be transported before the Lunar New Year, and the rest can be transported successively after the Spring Festival. It is also reported that the Grain Bureau has decided to allocate this rice to the Shanghai Grain Company to supply the needs of citizens.

    【本报讯】旬日来各地粮食大量运沪，沪市民食粮供应已有保证。其中东北支援沪市大米，除首批六百六十吨已于本月中旬先后运到外，第二批九千零六十吨于日前开始运沪。华东粮食局为增加粮源保证春季前后市民粮食供应，已决定从嘉兴、松江、苏州、无锡、常州、镇江、扬州、南通、口岸、芜湖、杭州等地，调运大米三亿斤（大米约合二百万石，足可供沪市三月之需）赴沪。该批大米本月初旬即已开始启运，最近一周来，每日抵沪大米经常在六百万斤以上。据粮食局估计：旧历年前可运到大米一亿四千万斤至二亿斤，其余均可于春节后陆续运达。又悉：此项大米粮食局已决定拨交上海粮食公司供应市民需要。
