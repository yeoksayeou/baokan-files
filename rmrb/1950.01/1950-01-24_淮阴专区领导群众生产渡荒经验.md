    Huaian Special District's Experience in Leading the Masses to Produce and Overcome Famine
    The following are some of the better methods used by the Huaian Special District to lead disaster victims in overcoming famine, for reference by other regions:
    1. Cadres should investigate the disaster situation and solve the actual difficulties of the disaster victims. They should also use vivid and typical examples to get everyone to understand the importance of saving resources for disaster relief, helping each other in production, and organizing households in difficulty to help themselves through production. For example, Comrade Yu Zhang, the Party Branch Secretary of Hukou Township in Yaoji District, Suining County, did not just listen to the reports of village cadres but personally went to Mazhuang Village and found that Shao Kaiwen's family was selling their child due to running out of food. He immediately held a village meeting, introducing the pain and difficulties of Shao Kaiwen's family in selling their child, and used vivid facts to get villagers to understand the importance of saving resources for disaster relief and helping each other in production. As a result, the masses in this village consciously and voluntarily contributed their capital and labor to help households in difficulty to help themselves through production. Shao Kaiwen's capital for making vermicelli was also resolved. Originally, Shao Kaiwen's family was selling a child (priced at three dou of red grain and half a bolt of cloth), and nine people were still afraid of not surviving the famine and spring; but after making vermicelli to feed themselves, they could live without selling their child. Therefore, helping disaster victims with production is the most basic way to overcome famine. Although investigating the disaster and providing emergency relief in the cold winter, rainy, snowy weather is also necessary, it is more important to grasp the disaster situation and mobilize production at ordinary times.
    2. Cadres should take the lead in production, master typical examples, set an example, and use facts to guide the method of self-help through production, in order to increase everyone's confidence in self-help through production. For example, Qilicun Village in Advanced Township, Gaogou District, Lianshui County, first helped the Yu Jiaxing and Sun Yuzhang groups to sell salt. The two groups earned 77,000 yuan in the first trip. They publicized this real person and real event among the disaster victims at any time, and the production of selling salt was widely carried out. When sideline occupations such as selling salt, making vermicelli, and collecting grass became widespread in Advanced Township, and achievements were made, and the number of households running out of food was reduced from fifty-three to only seven, the confidence of cadres and the masses in production to overcome famine was even more strengthened. Military family member Wang Shouli said: "If it weren't for selling salt, it would have been terrible, but now life is not so anxious!" The relationship between cadres and the masses has also become closer. For example, Sun Yuzhang said: "The Communist Party is always planning for us. Next time, I will do whatever the cadres tell me to do!"
    3. Cadres should divide their work according to their production specialties, each leading a line, and use the snowball method to unite the masses to produce together, and continuously expand the organization in production. For example, Li Anzhou, the director of the Farmers' Association of Zhuwei Village, Kangzhuang Township, Laoshe District, Binhai County, Yancheng Sub-district, was in good health and had always promoted the transportation and sale of grain. It was decided that he would unite a group of people who could carry and transport goods to Xiangshuikou to transport soybeans to Dongkan for the public-owned rice mill. In three days, they managed to find eleven carts, and each person earned twelve jin of rice per trip. Grain administrator Ding Zhenggang was a semi-laborer who usually collected grass, so it was decided that he would unite some people to collect grass, and in less than two days, he united eight or nine people to collect grass. Squad leader Guo Shoujian, although not in good health, knew how to fish, so he led twenty-one people to fish, catching four hundred jin in ten days and selling them for 400,000 yuan. This method not only solved the difficulties of cadre families, but also gave play to the cadres' production specialties, which was better than the passive method of assigning work to cadres "guaranteeing that no one starves to death."
    4. According to natural villages, select people with experience and skills in sideline production as the center (group leader), and use the snowball method to organize and lead those with capital, labor, and plans to absorb households in difficulty to participate in joint production and earn profits to overcome famine. This is also the method of Advanced Township in Lianshui County.
    5. "Contracting for Dividends" method. That is, the entire group's disaster relief grain is used as loan capital (earning a total of 200 jin of grain by transporting and pressing oil). If any group member wants to do business, they can borrow capital to do so (stipulating that each household borrows no more than forty jin), and hand in a certain amount of dividends every month, and the surplus profit belongs to the individual. This can solve the lives of particularly difficult households and military families without labor. Dividends are paid every ten days, and the principal and interest are returned to the group within a month, and then used and borrowed again. This method not only makes it easy to develop individual small businesses, but also makes it easy to solve the difficulties of severely affected households without labor.

### 淮阴专区领导群众生产渡荒经验

    淮阴专区领导群众生产渡荒经验
    现介绍淮阴专区的几个较好的领导灾民渡荒的办法，供各地参考：
    一、干部一面查灾，一面解决灾民实际困难。并用活生生的典型事实，来打通大家节约救灾、互助生产的思想，组织困难户生产自救。像睢宁姚集区湖口乡支书玉章同志，不光听村干汇报，又亲自深入马庄村，查出邵开文家断炊卖孩子。立即开村民会，介绍邵开文家卖孩子痛苦和困难，用活生生的事实，打通村民节约救灾，互助生产的思想。结果，这村群众，在会上就自觉自愿地有本出本，有力出力，帮助困难户生产自救。邵开文的拐粉本钱也解决了。原来邵开文家卖一个孩子（价是三斗红粮，半匹大布），九口人还怕渡不出荒春；这番拐粉糊口，不卖孩子也有生活了。所以帮助灾民生产，是渡荒的最基本办法。虽然冬寒的阴雨雪天，查灾救急，也很必要；但是更重要的是平时掌握灾情，发动生产。
    二、干部带头生产，掌握典型，做出榜样，拿事实指导生产自救的办法，提高大家生产自救信心。如涟水高沟区先进乡七里村，先帮助余家兴、孙玉章两小组贩盐卖。头一趟两组赚人民币七万七千元。他们随时把这实人实事，在灾民中宣传，贩盐生产，就普遍开展了。等到先进乡全乡贩盐、拐粉、拾草等副业普遍开展，做出成绩，五十三户断炊户，只剩七户断炊，灾情大大缩小时，干部群众的生产渡荒信心，就更加坚定了。军属王守礼说：“不是卖盐，就不得了，这下生活不焦了！”干群关系也更加紧密了。如孙玉章说：“共产党处处为我们打算的，下回干部说干什么我干什么！”
    三、干部按生产特长分工，各领一行，用滚雪团办法，团结群众一齐生产，在生产中不断扩大组织。如盐城分区滨海县老舍区康庄乡朱圩村农会主任李安舟身体好，一贯推贩粮食，便决定他团结一批能担运的人，到响水口替公营机米厂运豆子上东坎。三天碰好十一挂车子，每趟每人赚十二斤大米。粮管员丁正纲，是个半劳动力，平时常弄草，就决定他团结些人弄草，不到两天就团结了八九个人弄草。分队长郭守建，身体虽不好，但会弄鱼，就领导二十一个人弄鱼，十天弄四百斤，卖人民币四十万元。这个办法既解决了干部家庭困难，也发挥了干部的生产特长，比消极的按家分工单要干部“保证不饿死人”的方法好。
    四、按自然村庄，选择对副业生产有经验有技能的人做中心（组长），用滚雪团办法，去组织领导有本钱的，有劳动力的，和有计划的吸收困难户参加，合伙生产，赚利渡荒，这也是涟水先进乡的办法。
    五、“包红利”办法。就是把全组救灾粮作为借贷资本（运打油赚利共二百斤粮食），组员中如果那个要做生意，就可借本去做（规定每户借不超过四十斤），按月交出一定红利，多余利是个人的。就可以解决全组特殊困难户和无劳力军属的生活。红利十天缴一次，一个月本利归还组内，再用再借。这个办法，既容易发挥个人小本生意，又容易解决无劳力的重灾户困难。
