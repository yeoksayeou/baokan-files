Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: According to TASS, Helsinki: The Finnish People's Democratic League held a presidential election rally on the 15th in the Helsinki Messuhalli, with nearly 10,000 participants. Finnish Communist Party General Secretary Ville Pessi delivered a speech amidst stormy applause, pointing out the historical importance of this presidential election to Finland. The Democratic League has nominated Pikola as its candidate, while the reactionary united front has nominated the current President Paasikivi as its candidate. After recalling Pikola's great achievements during his previous term in office, Bessi exposed Paasikivi's consistent fascist and anti-Soviet activities, pointing out that the Fagerholm government's policies were war-mongering policies that created economic crises and impoverished workers. Bessi called on the working class to strike a blow against the supporters of the "Paasikivi line," pointing out that the reactionary forces were far from being so powerful that they could not be defeated. All working people should vote for the People's Democratic League. Pikola is a long-tested fighter for the cause of the working class and an active defender of peace and friendship with the Soviet Union.

    Pikola delivered a speech at the meeting. Representatives of the working people of Kemi City paid their respects to the meeting and assured that the working people of Kemi would unanimously vote for Pikola.

    芬举行竞选总统大会
    芬共总书记贝西号召人民选举民主阵线候选人皮可拉
    【新华社北京十八日电】据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：芬兰人民民主联盟十五日在赫尔辛基米苏哈利大厅，举行竞选总统大会，参加者近万人。芬兰共产党总书记威利·贝西在暴风雨般的欢呼声中发表讲演，指出这次总统选举对芬兰的历史重要性。民主阵线已提名皮可拉为候选人，反动派联合阵线则提名现任总统巴锡基维为候选人。贝西在追述以前皮可拉执政时的伟大成就后，揭发巴锡基维一贯进行的法西斯活动和反苏活动，指出法吉荷尔姆政府的政策是制造战争，造成经济危机和使工人贫穷的政策。贝西号召工人阶级必须予“巴锡基维路线”的拥护者以打击，反动力量远非强大到不能被打败的程度。一切劳动人民应该投人民民主联盟的票。皮可拉是工人阶级事业的久经考验的斗士，是和平与对苏友好的积极保卫者。
    皮可拉在大会上发表了演说。开密城劳动人民代表向大会致敬，并保证开密劳动人民一致投皮可拉的票。
