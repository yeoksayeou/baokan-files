Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 23rd: The Northwest Bureau of the CCP Central Committee issued instructions on strengthening theoretical study for cadres on the job. The instructions stated:

    Due to the rapid and complete liberation of the five provinces in Northwest China in 1949, the situation of our cadres has undergone fundamental changes; the number of new cadres (including students, intellectuals, retained personnel, etc.) has changed from a minority in the Yan'an period to a majority. Due to historical circumstances, most new cadres are unfamiliar with Marxism-Leninism, and have been influenced by the deceptive propaganda of the reactionaries and the ideological influence of the old society during the long period under the dark rule of the Kuomintang. Generally, cadres who have been working in the liberated areas for a long time have not systematically and conscientiously studied Marxism-Leninism due to being in a difficult struggle environment for a long time, and their theoretical level is not high. Therefore, they often lack a correct and profound understanding of the international and domestic situation and the Party's program and policies. This all shows that we should launch a movement to study Marxism-Leninism. Especially in the current new period when peaceful construction has begun, if we do not make great efforts to improve ourselves theoretically, politically, and even culturally with the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, we will not be able to complete the serious task of economic construction. Especially for all cadres who have recently joined the work, if we do not systematically criticize the old ideas and establish new ideas with the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism—the weapon of historical materialism—and establish a revolutionary outlook on life and the world, we will not be able to strengthen their concept of serving the people. This is one of the most important and fundamental links in the current work, and it deserves the serious attention of the whole Party.

    The instructions pointed out: The important reasons why cadre education work has not created a warm learning atmosphere are: 1. The phenomenon of neglecting theoretical study is still very serious. Many Party leading cadres have not studied diligently themselves, and they do not pay enough attention to the theoretical study of their subordinate cadres. 2. They have not used organizational forms and learning methods suitable for the new situation based on today's situation (such as using newspapers, periodicals, and other tools) to help cadres study, stimulate their learning enthusiasm and confidence, and solve various difficulties in self-study; instead, they still focus on the compulsory learning methods based on groups in the past. 3. They have not concentrated necessary cadres and given them planned education and training to make them responsible for the education of cadres on the job.

    Regarding the content and steps of theoretical study for cadres on the job at all levels, the instructions stipulate: All middle-level and senior-level cadres who have practical work experience and appropriate cultural standards, in addition to regular study of current events and policies, should systematically and purposefully study the twelve books designated by Chairman Mao in the following steps, and strive to complete them in three years. The instructions suggest that the study of the twelve books be temporarily divided into the following three units: (1) Social Development History, Political Economy, Communist Manifesto, Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, as the first unit. Cadres at the county and regiment level and above should focus on the History of Social Development, and cadres at the provincial and military level and above should focus on Political Economy. (2) Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, State and Revolution, “Left-Wing” Communism: An Infantile Disorder, Foundations of Leninism as the second unit, which should focus on Foundations of Leninism. (3) History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course, Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Construction, Lenin and Stalin on China, Methodology of Thought as the third unit, which should focus on the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course.

    All cadres who have recently joined the work but have appropriate cultural standards should first undergo ideological transformation; after studying the History of Social Development and Political Economy and initially establishing basic revolutionary viewpoints, they should further study the basic problems of the Chinese revolution in combination with actual work, study the Party's various policies and the basic works of Chairman Mao and Comrade Liu Shaoqi; and then continue the study of the twelve books. Cadres with low cultural levels who cannot study Marxism-Leninism by themselves must first focus on learning culture. In addition, cadres below the county level should be trained in rotation in Party schools and cadre schools in a planned way. The main focus should be on learning professional policies and ideological education, but it should be combined with lectures on the History of Social Development so that they can understand some basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism in order to establish and strengthen their revolutionary viewpoints.

    In order to achieve the above learning goals, the instructions pointed out: In the learning movement, leading comrades at all levels should lead by example and repeatedly publicize the importance of studying Marxism-Leninism to cadres, and change the concept of neglecting theoretical study. In terms of learning methods, we should advocate diligent reading, striving to grasp the position, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism, linking with reality, and solving practical problems with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. The General Study Committee should become the general organization leading the study of cadres in the Northwest. It must set up a number of cadres with a certain theoretical level to plan, organize, and carry out various tasks. Party committees at all levels should establish study committees and establish good study systems, such as establishing a two-hour study system; a test must be taken each time the study comes to an end, and a study evaluation must be made to ensure the completion of the study plan. In addition to cadre cultural schools, individual large units can try to run cadre schools focusing on the study of theory and policies, and Party schools should set up cultural classes and plan to transfer old cadres with low cultural levels to study culture.

    中共中央西北局指示加强干部理论学习
    各级领导同志以身作则，提倡认真读书，配备一定干部负责计划组织学习。
    【新华社西安二十三日电】中共中央西北局发布加强在职干部理论学习的指示。该指示称：
    由于一九四九年西北五省的迅速全部解放，我们的干部情况发生了根本改变；新干部（包括学生、知识分子、留用人员等）的数量已由延安时期的少数变为多数。由于历史环境的原因，一般新干部对于马列主义是陌生的，而且过去长期在国民党黑暗统治下，曾受反动派的欺骗宣传的影响及旧社会的思想影响。一般参加解放区工作较久的干部，亦因长期处于艰苦的斗争环境中，没有系统地认真学习过马列主义，理论水平不高，因而对于国际国内的现状和党的纲领政策往往缺乏正确的深刻理解。这都说明我们应该开展一个学习马列主义的运动。尤其是在目前和平建设已经开始的新时期，若不用大力以马列主义、毛泽东思想的基本知识把我们从理论上、政策上以至文化上提高一步，我们将无法完成严重的经济建设任务。特别对于新近参加工作的一切干部，若不以马列主义的基本观点——历史唯物主义的武器，有系统地批判旧思想，建立新思想，确立革命的人生观与世界观，则将无法坚定其为人民服务的观念。这是目前工作中最重要最根本的环节之一，值得全党严重注意。
    指示指出：使干部教育工作还没有造成热烈的学习空气的重要原因是：一、忽视理论学习的现象仍很严重。有许多党的领导干部自己没有认真学习，对于所属干部的理论学习也不够重视。二、没有根据今天的情况运用适合于新情况的组织形式与学习方法（如利用报纸、刊物等工具），帮助干部学习，启发干部的学习热情与信心，解决自修学习中的各种困难；而仍然是着重于过去以小组为主的强制的学习方法。三、没有集中必要的干部，并给以有计划的教育培养，使其担任在职干部的教育工作。
    关于各级在职干部理论学习的内容和步骤，指示规定：凡有实际工作经验又有适当文化水准的中级与高级干部，除经常的时事政策学习外，应有计划有目的地按下列步骤学习毛主席指定的十二种书，并争取三年学完。指示提议，十二种书的学习暂分为以下的三个单元来进行：（一）社会发展史，政治经济学，共产党宣言，社会主义从空想到科学的发展，为第一单元。县级团级以上干部以社会发展史为中心，省级军级以上干部以政治经济学为中心。（二）帝国主义论，国家与革命，共产主义运动中的“左”派幼稚病，论列宁主义基础为第二单元，应以论列宁主义基础为中心。（三）联共（布）党史简明教程，列宁、斯大林论社会主义建设，列宁、斯大林论中国，思想方法论为第三单元，以联共（布）党史简明教程为中心。
    一切新参加工作但有适当文化水准的干部，应先进行思想改造；在学了社会发展史和政治经济学，初步建立了基本革命观点之后，应经过结合实际工作进一步学习中国革命的基本问题，学习党的各项政策与毛主席、刘少奇同志的基本著作；然后再继续十二种书的学习。不能自学马列主义的文化水平低的干部，必须首先以学习文化为主。此外，对县级以下的干部应有计划地在党校和干校中进行轮训。主要是学习业务政策及思想教育，但应配合讲授社会发展史，使之了解一些马列主义的基本知识，以确立并加强其革命观点。
    为了达到上述学习目的，指示指出：在学习运动中，各级领导同志应以身作则，并反复地向干部宣传学习马列主义的重要性，改变忽视理论学习的观念。在学习方法上，应提倡认真读书，求得掌握马列主义的立场、观点和方法，联系实际，以批评与自我批评的精神，解决实际问题。总学委会应成为领导西北干部学习的总的机构，必须设置有一定理论水平的干部若干人，计划组织与进行各种工作。各级党委应建立学委会，并建立优良的学习制度，如建立两小时学习制；学习每告一段落时，须测验一次，并做出学习鉴定等，以便保证学习计划的完成。个别大单位除干部文化学校外，可试办以学习理论政策为主的干部学校，党校应设文化班次，有计划的抽调文化低的老干部专学文化。
