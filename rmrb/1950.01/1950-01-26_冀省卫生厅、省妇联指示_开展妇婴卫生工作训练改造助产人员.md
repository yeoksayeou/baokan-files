    Hebei Provincial Health Department and Provincial Women's Federation Issue Instructions to Launch Women and Infant Health Work, Training and Transforming Midwives
    [Our Newspaper] The Hebei Provincial People's Government Health Department and the Provincial Women's Federation have jointly issued instructions to actively carry out rural women and infant health work. According to a survey of 19 villages in Xingtai, Shenxian, Cangxian, Pingshan and other places in the province, due to the lack of hygiene knowledge among old midwives, the infant mortality rate is over 50%. Deaths from convulsions (tetanus) account for 37% of the total deaths. At present, smallpox and measles have been found in many areas. The instructions from the Health Department and the Provincial Women's Federation charge county and district women's federations and relevant departments to pay special attention to midwifery education. The midwifery training classes run by each special district should continue to be held. This year, each county, county and district women's federation should have at least one or two people trained in midwifery. After training, the county and district women's federation cadres should, in conjunction with the central work, actively contact local health departments and medical associations to widely and deeply promote women and infant health through the forms of bazaars, temple fairs, propaganda sheds, storytelling sheds, theaters and women's forums; at the same time, focus on training and transforming the work of new and old midwives. Old midwives from three to five neighboring villages and women cadres or masses who are willing to do midwifery work can be called together for training, encouraging them to talk about their midwifery methods and experience, pointing out shortcomings, praising advantages, and educating them to accept new midwifery methods. The cadres leading the study should educate the students through actual midwifery practice; and educate the new midwives to learn the good experiences of the old midwives, and the old midwives should take new apprentices to prevent the phenomenon of looking down on each other and disunity. In key villages, surveys of women's and infant's birth and death should also be conducted to assist in the establishment of village health committees in order to carry out women and infant health work in the future. County and district women's federations and county health departments should promptly understand and report the work of the new and old midwives who have been trained after they return, the role they have played, and the difficulties they have encountered. In addition, governments and women's federations at all levels should widely publicize the prevention methods of smallpox and measles and mobilize the masses to be vaccinated. If smallpox or measles are found, promptly report it and actively equip doctors for active prevention and treatment.
    In order to carry out the above work, the instructions stipulate that women's federations at all levels should assign a person to lead women and infant health work; the health departments of each special commissioner's office, county, city, and town may, when there are suitable candidates, submit a request to the Health Department for approval to establish a women's health clerk.
