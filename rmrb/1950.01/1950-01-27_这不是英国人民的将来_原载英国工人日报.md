This is Not the Future for the British People. Originally Published in the British Worker's Daily
By Shi Long, Translated by Chen Peiming

The British people in 1945 voted for the policies outlined by the Labour Party in the booklet "Let Us Face the Future." But this policy has been abandoned, replaced by the Conservative Party’s – the Labour Party’s armaments and war, devaluation and disaster policy.

Let us look at the likely future depicted by the spokesmen of our government and their masters – the Americans.

"In future wars, the Atlantic will become the Mediterranean of the last war, and Britain will be in the position of Malta." This was said by Mr. Dugdale, Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, in Parliament on March 9th of this year.

Malta shed blood and tears beyond its share, its heroism earning it the George Cross. Suppose we earn the Truman Cross. But is it worth it?

"In the next war, as in the last, let us arm the soldiers of other countries, let them send their sons to be cannon fodder, and not send our own children."

The New York Times reported on April 14th, on the words of the currently well-known Cannon (Chairman of the Appropriations Committee).

British Member of Parliament, Mr. Raikes Chamberlain, questioned Mr. Bevin on February 9th of this year (1949) whether he could guarantee under the Atlantic Pact, "that we would not automatically become belligerents once war broke out between the United States and the Soviet Union?" Mr. Bevin's answer was straightforward: "No, sir." This means that Britain, once a strong power, will now be at war with the Soviet Union at the decision of American rulers.

When the Soviet Union made one peace proposal after another, every method was used to prevent acceptance.

The most honest and amusing was the statement made by Senator Dulles, a leader in American foreign policy, on July 12th: "Last month in Paris, there was discussion of whether to accept the armistice proposed by the Soviet Union, or even to resume the Four Power talks on a trial basis. Some people are afraid that the relaxation of East-West tension will cause Americans to become complacent, so it is necessary to artificially keep them alarmed."

"Artificially keep them alarmed" to prevent them from being tempted by the "armistice proposed by the Soviet Union." Note that it is the Soviet Union that proposes the armistice, and it is the United States that creates artificial alarm. And we, for Bevin's sake, are drowned in the artificial alarm of our newspapers and the British Broadcasting Corporation.

Why does Western civilization, Christian civilization, Anglo-American civilization, need a state of artificial alarm in a world where socialist Soviet Union proposes peace?

The *Daily Herald* and Mr. Bevin will not give you the answer to that question, but American newspapers will.

At the beginning of this year, Truman said: "In 1949, we are entering a period of more serious testing. The demand created by the war and the purchasing power created by the war have disappeared, and we must now rely more fully on the purchasing power currently created to absorb all goods and services."

Thus, under Western civilization, after four years of peace, we are entering a "more serious testing." But in the Soviet Union and the New Democracies, life is becoming increasingly comfortable.

What to do? Pour goods into Europe under the Marshall Plan. This helps delay your crisis, but it is not enough to stop it. Most importantly, rearm.

Armaments, means of mass destruction and mass slaughter, as long as a state of alarm is maintained, even if it is artificial alarm, it provides an unlimited market.

Here are some examples of what American newspapers have said on this topic. Some of them you may have already seen.

"Only an improved international situation will dim the commercial outlook." -- *Commercial Bulletin*, March 23, 1948.

"In June, business continued to rise... and the whole structure is supported by the European Recovery Program and the anticipated larger military budget." -- *Monthly Letter of the National City Bank of New York*, July 1948

"From the company's profit point of view, although 'peace fears' are probably not a near-term thing, its impact – if we had 'peace fears' it would reduce weapons spending – may be worse than a modest tax increase." -- *The Wall Street Journal*, November 20, 1948.

"Peace, if it really came, would mess things up. Arms spending and aid to other countries are supporting business." -- *U.S. News & World Report*, December 31, 1948.

"Some capitalists are afraid that if we make peace with the Soviet Union, our military budget will be cut, which will cause their business activities to decline." -- *New York Star*, January 2, 1949.

That's what the American newspapers are saying.

At Christmas, every church throughout the Christian West routinely recited the slogan: "Peace on Earth." But on New Year's Eve, *U.S. News & World Report* threw a wet blanket on the festivities, saying "Peace, if it really came, would mess things up."

The Labour Party said in 1945: "We must consolidate the great wartime alliance of the British Commonwealth, the United States, and the Soviet Union in peacetime." The Labour Party attacked the Conservative Party because the Conservative Party, between the First and Second World Wars, "was so afraid of the Soviet Union that it lost the opportunity to form an alliance with the Soviet Union – which could have prevented the war."

The Labour Party said in the booklet "Let Us Face the Future," "The tried and tested people who did well in the war can get a peace suitable for them. The people lost that peace."

The Labour Party made us believe that under a Labour government, the people would win peace.

But today, it is the stern-faced men of Wall Street and Washington, supported by Churchill and Woolton, Bevin and Attlee, who are swaggering under a crumbling economic system (perhaps it will never recover from the crisis). We can only regain our independence by implementing socialist policies and being friendly to the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union has proposed a one-third reduction in armaments. This would save us more than £250 million a year, enough to build more than 200,000 new homes.

But American capitalists voted against it, so the British Labour government also voted against it.

The Soviet Union proposed banning atomic bombs, destroying existing atomic bombs, supervised by the Security Council, and sharing atomic energy knowledge among all countries to improve the living standards of the people of the world.

American capitalists voted against it, and the British government also voted against it.

In December 1947, the Soviets proposed to supply us with six million tons of grain over six years. We accepted 750,000 tons. According to the actual terms of the agreement, the Soviet Union only needed to supply us with 550,000 tons, but they gave us 764,000 tons.

This behavior is officially called "thirteen Kremlin villains are trying to hinder Britain's recovery."

Yes, let us face the future. Under the current situation where the Conservative-Labour Party is groveling to the American big capitalists, the future of Britain is indeed bleak. But Britain can be strong again and have an independent foreign policy.

Cooperate with the socialist Soviet Union on an equal footing to seek peace, disarmament, and expanded world trade without any political conditions. This is the future that the British people voted for in 1945. But they did not get it.

Now, the British people can only obtain it by taking action to support socialist policies for peace and prosperity.

    这不是英国人民的将来  原载英国工人日报
    史龙著  陈佩明译
    英国人民在一九四五年投票赞成工党在《让我们面对将来》这小册子中所概述的政策。但这一政策已经被抛弃，代替它的是保守党——工党的军备与战争、贬值与灾难的政策。
    我们来看看我国政府代言人及其主子——美国人所描写的大概的将来吧。
    “在将来的战争中，大西洋会变成前次战争中的地中海，而英国则处于马尔他的地位。”这是国会议员德格旦尔，海军部的国会秘书，今年三月九日在国会说的。
    马尔他流了血和泪，超乎它的份儿，它的英勇膺得了乔治十字勋章。假定，我们将膺得杜鲁门十字勋章。但，这是值得的吗？
    “在下一次战争中，一如上次战争一样，让我们武装其他国家的士兵，让他们派遣他们的男丁去当炮灰，而不要派遣我们自己的子弟去。”
    四月十四日纽约时报如此报导目前闻名的凯努（议会拨款委员会主席）的话。
    英国会议员雷诺·张伯伦在今（一九四九）年二月九日质问贝文先生能否保证在大西洋公约之下，“一旦美苏发生战争，我们不会自动地成为参战者？”贝文先生的回答是直截了当的：“不，先生。”这意味着，英国一度是个强国，现在会由美国统治者的决定而与苏联作战。
    当苏联接二连三地提出和平建议时，都被用尽一切方法来阻止接受。
    最老实而最好笑的，是美国外交政策领导人参议员杜勒斯在七月十二日所讲的话：“上月在巴黎讨论过是否接受苏联所提出的休战，甚至在试验性的基础上恢复四强会商。有些人害怕东西紧张之松驰，将使美国人因而松懈，所以必需以人为的方法使其继续惊慌。”
    “人为地使其惊慌”以阻止他们被“苏联提出的休战”所诱惑。请注意，提出休战的是苏联，而造成人为的惊慌的，是美国。而我们呢，为了贝文的缘故，被我们的报纸与英国的广播公司的人为的惊慌所淹没。
    为什么西方文明，基督教文明，英美文明，在社会主义苏联提议和平的世界上，需要人为的惊慌的状态呢？
    《每日先锋报》与贝文先生不会给你对那个问题的回答，但美国报纸会回答你。
    今年开初，杜鲁门说：“一九四九年，我们正进入更严重考验的时期。战争所造成的需求与战争所造成的购买力，已经消失，我们现在必须更加充分依靠目前造成的购买力来吸收全部货物与服务。”
    这样，在西方文明之下，经过四年和平，我们进入“更严重的考验”。而在苏联与新民主主义国家，生活却日益舒适。
    怎么办呢？在马歇尔计划下向欧洲倾注货物。这有助于拖延你们的危机，但它不足以阻止危机。最重要的，是重新武装。
    武装，大量毁坏与大量屠杀的手段，只要保持着惊慌的状态，就使是人为的惊慌，那它就提供了无限制的市场。
    这里有一些美国报纸在这题目上说些什么的例子。其中若干或许你们已经看过了。
    “只有一种改善了的国际情势，才会使商业前景趋于暗淡。”——一九四八年三月二十三日《商业日报》。
    “在六月份，商业继续上升……而整个构造是由欧洲复兴计划与预期中的更庞大的军备预算所支持着。”——一九四八年七月《纽约花旗银行公报》
    “从公司的利润观点来看，虽然“和平恐惧”大概不是最近将来的事情，但它的影响——如果我们有了“和平恐惧”就会降低武器开支——也许会比温和的增税还糟。”——一九四八年十一月二十日《华尔街杂志》。
    “和平假若真正到来，将会把事情搅糟。武装开支与援助他国正支持着商业。”——一九四八年十二月三十一日《美国新闻与世界报导》。
    “若干资本家害怕如果我们与苏联商得和平，我们的军事预算削减，这会使他们的商业活动趋于下降。”——一九四九年一月二日《纽约明星报》。
    美国报纸就是这么说的。
    在圣诞节，全基督教西方每一个教堂里都照常诵吟这个口号：“和平降临大地”。但在除夕那天，《美国新闻与世界报导》却扫人兴头，说“和平如果真正来临，将把事情搅糟”。
    工党在一九四五年说：“我们必须在和平时期巩固大英联邦与美苏两国的伟大的战时的联合。”工党攻击保守党，因为保守党在第一次世界大战至第二次大战之间，“是如此地恐惧苏联，以致丢失了与苏联结为盟友——这满可防止战争——的机会。”
    工党在《让我们面对将来》这小册子中说，“在战争中干得不错的经过磨练的人们，能够获得适合于他们的一种和平。人民失去了那种和平。”
    工党叫我们相信在工党政府之下，人民会赢得和平。
    但今天，是华尔街和华盛顿的面色严厉的人们，得到邱吉尔与乌尔顿，贝文与艾德礼之支持，在一种已临危机的经济制度（也许它永不能从危机恢复过来）下，飞扬拔扈。我们只有实行社会主义的政策及对苏联友善，才能重获我们的独立。
    苏联已经提议缩减军备三分之一。这就会一年节省我们二亿五千万余镑，这足以建造二十多万所新屋。
    但美国资本家投票反对，所以，英国工党政府也投票反对。
    苏联建议禁用原子弹，毁去现在存储的原子弹，由安理会监督其实现，并将原子能知识归各国共用，以提高世界人民的生活水准。
    美国资本家投票反对，英国政府也投票反对。
    一九四七年十二月，苏联人提议在六年中供给我们六百万吨谷物。我们接受七十五万吨。根据实际协定的条文，苏联只须供给我们五十五万吨，但他们给了我们七十六万四千吨。
    这种行为官方称之为“十三个克里姆林恶徒正企图阻碍英国复原”。
    不错，让我们面对将来吧。在目前保守党——工党匍匐于美国大资本家的情况下，英国的将来确是暗淡。但是，英国能再度强大，而有一独立的外交政策。
    以平等地位与社会主义的苏联合作，以谋和平，裁减军备，及扩展的世界贸易而不附任何政治条件。这是英国人民在一九四五年所投票赞成的将来。但他们并未获得。
    现在，英国人民，只有采取赞成为和平与繁荣的社会主义政策之行动，才能获得它。
