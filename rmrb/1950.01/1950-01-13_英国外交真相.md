The post-war foreign policy of Britain has been so anti-national and against the major interests of the people and the country, that even Britons who wanted to peek into the diplomatic kitchen where this policy was made were nauseated by the stench. The book by British journalist Ralph Parker, just published in Moscow, proves this even more. (Note)

Parker has represented British newspapers in Southeast Europe since 1934, and has been a correspondent in Moscow for The Times and other British and American newspapers for eight years since 1941. His book does not contain any secret diplomatic documents, or new shocking revelations about British diplomatic activities. But his book itself is an important document.

Parker had the opportunity to observe British diplomacy (and American, because they are inseparable) from the inside. He is familiar with the secret workings of British and American diplomacy. And when this British journalist, whose origin and education belonged to the British ruling class, tells everything he knows, he must have been stirred by patriotic enthusiasm, and realized how dangerous the road led by the agents of the monopolistic capitalists who hold great power is.

Parker's book cannot be regarded as a thorough analysis and detailed record of European history in the last decade. But the author has a sharp pen and the observation of a professional journalist. His report is actually a very fluent and powerful commentary on historical events. As a journalist who obtained news from official representatives in London and Washington, he vividly depicted the direction of British foreign policy in the last decade. The essence of this policy is summarized in the title of the book: "Conspiracy Against Peace." This also shows the reason for the appearance of this book: Parker is willing to make public what he has seen and heard about this conspiracy.

	British reactionary foreign policy has led them from the Munich surrender to the Atlantic Pact

"The Atlantic Pact and other manifestations of Anglo-American imperialist aggressive intentions," Parker wrote in the preface, "are derived from a deliberately fabricated myth (the myth of the Soviet aggression danger). As a journalist who has lived in the Soviet Union for eight years, I believe that it is my duty to my country to refute the malicious rumors of the warmongers with my own observations.

"The British people should understand the truth about those among them who betray their interests and the cause of peace.

"It was after long and arduous experience that I understood this truth. I grew up in a middle-class environment and did not understand the harsh realities of life; in order to understand this truth, I had to go through the lessons of experience.

"I have been a correspondent for British newspapers in Europe for fifteen years. During those years, the development of British foreign policy was always before my eyes, and year after year I saw it gradually become more and more reactionary. I believe that the formulation and implementation of this policy is against the interests of the vast majority of people in our country, and that this policy has led them from the Munich surrender to the Atlantic Pact."

Parker was a correspondent in Prague when Britain betrayed Czechoslovakia to Hitler in Munich. He witnessed this event with his own eyes. Of course, it was not until after the war that many British official documents were published, confirming the duplicity of the British government's foreign policy, that he understood this matter. But even at that time, the underlying motives of the conspiracy against peace were obvious.

"Behind the appeasement policy was the conspiracy of British and American financiers who were eager to negotiate successfully with Hitler, so as to not only preserve but further develop their large investments in Germany." Here, the interests of British and American capitalists are intertwined. They all wanted Hitler to expand eastward. They planned to fund the Nazi bandits after they occupied Ukraine and the Caucasus when they needed funds to exploit those places.

We saw the initial situation after the German occupation of Prague. British diplomats cooperated with Hitler's bandits. They were not alarmed by the Nazi atrocities, nor did they feel any unease about the cruel treatment of the workers in Kladno. The British government continued secret negotiations with Germany, on how to "subdue Russia."

We also saw another capital from 1939 to 1941, Belgrade. Yugoslavia was then the center of imperialist espionage activities. Foreign journalists combined "other more profitable work" – from armed trade to espionage work with journalism. Journalists were busy being recruited for espionage work. This was well known. The journalists were very clear that Britain's Balkan policy and her secret activities were only partly aimed at dealing with German aggression.

"For us Britons living in Belgrade," Parker wrote, "many people knew that British secret work focused on finding reliable political allies who could help maintain a bridgehead once Britain landed on the Balkan Peninsula."

Another purpose was to hinder the struggle of genuine anti-fascists to liberate their country from foreign aggression. At that time, British spies had already—

"Put the main effort on accommodating potential traitors who had the labels of "anti-fascists" and "national heroes" during the war."

These roles are clear to everyone today.

The corrupt groups in power in Yugoslavia wanted to curry favor with both Hitler's bandits and British imperialists. Both did whatever they wanted freely in Yugoslavia. Today we can see that Belgrade is still a center of espionage and secret agents. Parker's observation of Yugoslavia in 1939 is fully applicable to Yugoslavia in 1949:

"No matter how old the tradition of national independence is, if it is led by traitors who regard foreign intervention as a favor, the fate of this country is doomed."

Prague and Belgrade were just the beginning. Parker did not fully understand this conspiracy against peace until later. During his residence in the Soviet Union, he had the opportunity to closely observe Anglo-American diplomatic activities, and he thoroughly understood that it was a diplomatic activity against peace and against the interests of the people. Here he saw many things he had never seen before. A brief autobiography in his book is quite important. Readers can know that he came from a middle-class family, and he was educated in British middle schools. He described those schools as "places where racial prejudice and contempt for the working class are enforced," where "every piece of news about the Soviet Union is shamefully distorted to instill hatred of the Soviet Union."

In these schools, students are limited to responding to calls to defend "Christian holiness" and "European traditions," while also hating everything that is truly democratic, new, and progressive.

"When I came to the Soviet Union, I did not blindly worship the Soviet Union. I wanted to take an honest and unadorned look. Some people used to tell me that this country was where the hopes of all progressive mankind were pinned, while others said it was a place to worship evil. I wanted to see the truth about her myself."

Parker saw the Soviet Union in its most tragic situation, when she was plunged into the bloodshed of the war of resistance against fascism. He also saw her jubilation on Victory Day. He saw the creative and constructive labor of the Soviet people in peacetime. He saw their courage, perseverance, and he understood the great ideals that inspired them, the ideals that gave mankind a future of peace and happiness. Parker stood with the Soviet people politically and spiritually, and he wanted to write the truth about the Soviet Union. But what the British rulers demanded of him was completely different, even during the war when they pretended to be friendly to the Soviet Union.

Foreign readers are interested in Parker's observations on Soviet life, while the Soviet people are even more interested in his exposure of British diplomatic activities in the Soviet Union.

Parker gradually saw that this activity had great malice and blind hostility towards the Soviet Union. He saw the arrogant contempt of British and American diplomats and their entourages in other embassies for the Soviet people. He saw that they did not understand, nor did they intend to understand, the character of the Soviet people, and they underestimated the strength of the Soviet state.

	The reason for the failure of Anglo-American foreign policy is narrow class prejudice and reactionary blindness

These observations by the British journalist helped readers understand the reasons for the repeated defeats suffered by Anglo-American foreign policy today. Its inherent shortcomings are narrow class prejudice, reactionary blindness, astonishingly narrow worldview, extreme contempt for the broad masses of people, and stubborn denial of the legitimate desire of all nations to strive for freedom and independence.

The American and British ruling classes once hoped that when the war ended, the Soviet Union would be exhausted and forced to submit, opening its doors to welcome foreign capital and abandoning its socialist achievements. This hope led Anglo-American diplomats in Moscow to collect, and more often fabricate, some of the most ridiculous and malicious remarks, sending them to their governments and newspapers in order to deceive the people. During the war, they made malicious and foolish stories that the Soviet state was abandoning communism; after the war, they spread rumors that the Soviet Union was weak, or on the contrary, that the Soviet Union was an aggressive country.

These nonsensical rumors fabricated by anti-Soviet experts were distributed by the embassies to journalists, who then passed them on to newspapers in capitalist countries.

Parker recounted how, during the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, the British Embassy kept visiting journalists who were considered to be able to give the British an understanding of the discussions on the German issue. British newspaper correspondents stationed in Moscow for a long time were treated coldly and were not trusted. British Foreign Office personnel brought reliable "diplomatic journalists" to Moscow, whom the journalists called "tame seals" or "bedroom attendants." These "tame seals" accepted instructions to create British public opinion to make it consistent with the Anglo-American government's imperialist line on Germany, with their destruction of the Potsdam Agreement, and with their conspiracy against peace. Diplomatic journalists gathered every night in the hotel room of the official spokesman of the British delegation. This gathering gradually became known as "briefing," which was originally the military term for military talks instructing bomber pilots before they took off. After each briefing, these journalists bombarded the British people with another batch of fabricated news and anti-Soviet rumors.

	The British Embassy prepared a large number of distorted reports on the Soviet Union's politics, economy, and culture for their journalists

The British Embassy prepared a large number of distorted reports on all aspects of Soviet life—politics, economy, culture, and education, etc. The American Embassy also gave the same reports to American journalists. Based on these pre-made embassy summaries, Ward, Welsh, and other journalists wrote their false observations and false impressions. Parker said that American journalists in Moscow were mainly engaged in copying these embassy reports into their notebooks. These reports were mostly absurd fabrications: fabricated statistics, imagined stories, and empty talks were all made by them. One journalist even wrote a nonsense article based on what he claimed to have heard from a Russian girl named Misha!

Parker wrote about the life and habits of British diplomats in Moscow. He painted a true picture of the British Embassy. Sir Kerr was famous for his baseness, and he bowed to Kennan, one of the most powerful agents of the American warmongers. Sir Peterson was a calm, old-fashioned diplomat who was panicked by the currency reform, which stopped the monetary speculation business of many senior diplomats.

Robert, the British Minister in Moscow from 1944 to 1947, now Assistant High Commissioner in India, tirelessly collected anti-Soviet rumors and sarcasm. This diplomat took every opportunity to instill the idea that war with the Soviet Union was inevitable. Harrison, Robert's successor, also followed the same line, which came from the American Embassy.

	The entire activity of the Anglo-American Embassy in Moscow during the war was espionage

As early as during the war, Parker saw that diplomats from many different countries were united not to oppose Hitlerism together, but to oppose the Soviet Union together. The anti-Soviet diplomatic group even had a "treasure house" of information about the Soviet Union collected by spies from major embassies. The entire activity of the Anglo-American Embassy in Moscow was espionage. It was no accident that George Hill, one of Britain's most famous spies, was appointed as a senior diplomatic official in Moscow during the war. Hill was a spy in Russia from 1917 to 1918, and also the author of a shameless book called "Go Spy Out the Land," in which he advocated espionage and sabotage against the Soviet Union.

When the Soviet army was fighting the Hitler bandits, saving the British Isles from fascist enslavement, British diplomats were building an anti-Soviet sabotage front in Moscow. Around them gathered Polish reactionaries, who at that time did not hide their hostility towards the Soviet Union, and collected intelligence for the British Embassy. They dreamed of seizing power in Poland after the war, inciting opposition to the opening of a second front, and wanting the armies of Western countries to enter Poland from the south via the Balkans. They hoped to organize a Polish-Czech alliance to rule the Balkans. Parker said that the notorious British spy Lockhart and Churchill's personal adjutant Caccialli were actively involved in the preparation of this event, the latter's family having previously had large economic interests in Tsarist Russia.

But giving support to the London Poles and their conspiracy against the Soviet Union and Polish democracy was only one of the anti-Soviet activities of the British Embassy. Parker explained these events in detail because, in his opinion, it was to clearly point out the shameful conspiracy of the British ruling class when the Soviet people were engaged in a tense and heroic struggle with Hitler's Germany.

	British diplomacy has simply become an echo of American diplomacy

For those who study Anglo-American post-war foreign policy, this conspiracy against peace is even more obvious. Washington is the center of this policy. There is no doubt that British diplomacy has simply become an echo of American diplomacy.

Parker talked about the sad spectacle of British diplomats in Moscow bowing to their American counterparts. The British and French embassies were subordinate to the American Embassy.

"From 1944 onwards," Parker wrote, "for every diplomatic negotiation with the Soviet government, the three embassies were unanimous, with the American opinion dominating everything."

American diplomats began to occupy a leading position in the diplomatic corps. They selected experts in anti-Soviet conspiracies, like Kennan. Much has already been written about this mortal enemy of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. But Parker added a few more strokes. Proud, ignorant, and arrogant, this embodiment of a dying capitalist society, Kennan, declared with contempt that the European continent—

"Is inhabited by a group of listless, mismanaged, exhausted people who deserve to be led by the American middle class."

In his foolish confidence, he believed that the Soviet people would be "exhausted" in victory. Even before the gunfire had stopped, this devil was talking about a new war.

Victory Day in Moscow. The streets were full of jubilant crowds. The windows of the American Embassy on Makhovaya Street were tightly closed in disapproval. Ambassador Kennan, the figure who held the secret anti-Soviet diplomatic hub, stood by a curtain and peeked out at the street. Parker heard him coldly murmur:

"They are cheering... they think the war is over, but the war has only just begun."

The war launched by Kennan and his accomplices was the "Cold War," the vile war of "tuxedos and daggers," the war of tricks, provocations, and slander.

	The British Foreign Office is still controlled by people who advocated "appeasement" towards Nazi aggressors in those years

The moldy atmosphere of the diplomatic corps, their anti-Soviet conspiracies, and their boring parties did not change with the rise of the British Labor Party. Despite its campaign promises, the Labor government is carrying out Churchill's anti-Soviet foreign policy. The chefs in the British diplomatic kitchen have not been replaced.

The British Foreign Office is still controlled by people who advocated "appeasement" towards Nazi aggressors in those years, such as Sir Kirkpatrick and William Strang. The only new activity of the British Foreign Office is the various new departments and special intelligence agencies established to expand the espionage network in other countries. For the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, the main task of the British Foreign Office, in Parker's words, is focused on "the question of how to organize a reliable intelligence agency."

Now there is another thing that Bevin's Foreign Office attaches particular importance to, and that is propaganda through newspapers and radio in Britain and other countries. Because [Ernest] Bevin's foreign policy is an anti-people policy, it needs a powerful propaganda machine to deceive the people and conceal or distort the truth. The task of the new intelligence organization is to supply this machine with the necessary information.

The British Foreign Office is striving to build a gap between the Soviet people and the British people who have a deep interest in the Soviet Union. Not only has nothing been done to satisfy this interest, but on the contrary, the propaganda machine directed by the Foreign Office is instilling in the people a large number of lies fabricated by cunning journalists, rumor-mongers, traitors, and renegades. The purpose is to reduce the prestige of the Soviet Union among the British people, and to arouse suspicion and distrust of the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union's peaceful policy is an obstacle to the warmongers' plans, and shatters their conspiracy against peace.

	Parker decided to publish his notes in order to make people all over the world understand the anti-peace conspiracy of the warmongers

Parker decided to publish his notes in order to make people all over the world see the anti-peace policy of those who are betraying peace and driving countries into another war. His book is a serious blow to British foreign policy decision-makers. As exposed by another British journalist, Johnston, the former editor of *British Ally*, Parker's notes are a very important event in one sense. It exposes the vile and dirty conspiracy of the Anglo-American warmongers. (Translated from *New Times*, Issue 43)

    英国外交真相
    什基尼瓦作  王群译
    英国战后的外交政策是如此的反民族与反对人民和国家的主要利益，使得想探视一下制造这种政策的外交厨房的英国人，都因那臭气作呕不止。刚在莫斯科出版的英国记者拉尔夫·巴克的著作更能证明了这一点。（注）
    巴克自从一九三四年起便代表英国报纸驻在东南欧，并且自一九四一年起做了八年泰晤士报和其他英美报纸驻莫斯科的记者。他的书没有包含什么秘密外交文件，或者对什么英国外交活动新的骇人听闻的揭发。但是他的书本身便是一件重要的文件。
    巴克有机会由内部观察英国的外交（和美国的，因为他们是分不开的）。他熟悉英美外交的秘密工作。而当这位出身和所受教育都属于英国统治阶级的英国记者在告诉他所知道的一切时，他一定为爱国的热情所激动，并了解到握有大权的垄断资本家的代理人们所引向的道路是多么危险。
    巴克的书不能算是近十年欧洲历史的透彻分析和详尽记载。但是作者有一支锐利的笔，和一个职业记者的观察力。他的报导其实就是对于历史事件的非常流畅有力的评论。作为一个从伦敦和华盛顿官方代表处得到消息的记者，他以活泼生动的笔调描划了英国近十年外交政策的方向。这种政策的本质归纳在这本书的名称上面：《反和平的阴谋》。这也表明了这本书出现的原故：巴克愿意把他对这种阴谋的见闻公之于世。
            英国反动的外交政策已引领着他们从慕尼黑投降走到大西洋公约了
    “大西洋公约和其他英美帝国主义侵略意图的表现，”巴克在序言里写着，“都是导源于一个故意制造出来的神话（苏维埃侵略危险的神话）。做为一个在苏联住了八年的新闻记者，我认为以我自己的观察来反驳战争贩子们的恶意造谣，是我对于祖国的责任。
    “英国人民应当了解他们中间那些出卖他们利益与和平事业的人们的真象。
    “经过了长久和艰苦的经验才使我明白了这种真象。我是从中产阶级环境长大起来的，不了解严酷的生活现实；为了明白这真理，我不得不通过经验的教训。
    “我在欧洲为英国报纸做访员已十五年。在那些岁月中，英国外交政策的发展无时不在我的眼前，而一年年地我看见它日渐走向反动。我相信制订与执行这种政策是违反我国广大人民的利益的，而且这种政策已经引领着他们从慕尼黑投降走到大西洋公约了。”
    巴克是英国在慕尼黑把捷克出卖给希特勒时驻在布拉格的记者。他亲眼目睹这件事情。当然，对于他也是等到战后许多英国官方文件公开了，证实了英国政府外交政策的两面性之后，才明白这事情的。但是即使在当时，反对和平的阴谋的潜在动机已很明显。
    “在绥靖政策幕后是英美金融家急欲和希特勒谈判成功的阴谋，好使不但保全了而更进一步发展他们在德国的大量投资。”在这里英美资本家的利益是绞在一起的。他们都要希特勒向东方扩张。他们打算在纳粹匪帮占领乌克兰和高加索之后需要资金去剥削那些地方的时候，便资助他们。
    我们看到了德国侵占布拉格后初期的情况。英国外交人员们和希特勒匪徒共同合作。他们不为纳粹的暴行所惊恐，对于克拉德诺的工人所受的残酷待遇也没有感到一点的不安。英国政府继续和德国秘密谈判。如何“使俄国屈服”。
    我们又看到从一九三九年到一九四一年的另一个首都，贝尔格拉德。南斯拉夫那时是帝国主义间谍活动的中心。外国记者把“其他更能生利的工作，”——从武装经商到间谍工作与新闻工作结合在一起了。新闻记者都忙着给招募去做间谍工作。这是人所共知的。记者们是非常清楚的，英国的巴尔干政策和她的秘密活动只不过是部分地对付德国的侵略而已。
    “对我们住在贝尔格拉德的英国人，”巴克写着，“许多人都知道英国的秘密工作着重在找寻可靠的政治盟友，一旦英国登陆巴尔干半岛时能够帮忙保持一个桥头堡垒。”
    另一个目的是阻碍真正反法西斯者为解放其本国免受外来侵略而进行斗争。当时英国间谍已经——
    “把主要工作放在收容在战时有“反法西斯者”和“民族英雄”标记的潜在的叛徒。”
    这些角色在今天是大家都看清了的。
    在南斯拉夫掌握政权的腐化集团想同时向希特勒匪徒和英帝国主义者谄媚。两者都在南斯拉夫自由地为所欲为。我们今天可以看见贝尔格拉德同样还是一个间谍和密探的活动中心。巴克在一九三九年对南斯拉夫的观察完全适用于一九四九年的南斯拉夫：
    “不管国家独立的传统多么古老，如果是被那些把外国干涉看作恩惠的卖国贼所领导，这国土的命运就注定了。”
    布拉格和贝尔格拉德只是个开端而已。巴克到后来才完全明白了这反和平的阴谋。在苏联居住期间他有机会密切地观察英美外交活动，他才彻底明白那是反和平，反人民利益的外交活动。在这里他头一次看见了许多前所未见的事物。他书里的一段简短的自传是相当重要的。读者可以知道他出身于中等阶级，他在英国中等学校受教育。他描述那些学校是“强制执行种族偏见和轻视工人阶级的处所”，在那里“每一件关于苏联的消息都是可耻地歪曲了，以灌输对苏联的憎恨。”
    在这些学校里，学生们给限定去响应保卫“基督神圣”和“欧洲传统”的呼喊，同时还要憎恨一切真正民主的，新的和进步的事物。
    “我来到苏联的时候，我没有盲目的对苏联的崇拜。我要正直不苟地看一下。从前有人对我说这个国家是所有进步人类希望寄托的地方，另一些人说是崇拜罪恶的地方。我要亲自看看她的真象。”
    巴克看见了处于最悲惨境遇时的苏联，当她陷入抵抗法西斯战争的血泊之中的时候。他也看见了她在胜利日的狂欢。他看见了苏联人民在和平时期的创造性与建设性的劳动。他看见了他们的勇敢，坚毅，他明白了那个鼓舞他们的伟大理想，给与人类和平与幸福的前途的理想。巴克在政治上和精神上是和苏联人民站在一起的，他要写出苏联的真象。但是英国统治者对他所要求的却是与这绝不相同的，就是在战时当他们伪装着和苏联友好时也是如此。
    外国读者对巴克关于苏联生活的观察感到兴趣，苏联人民对于他关于英国在苏联外交活动的暴露则更感兴趣。
    巴克一步步看到这种活动具有绝大的恶意和对苏联的盲目敌视。他看见了英美外交家和他们在其他大使馆的随从们对苏联人民的高傲的轻蔑。他看见了他们不明白，也不打算明白苏联人民的性格，他们低估了苏维埃国家的力量。
            英美外交政策失败的原因是狭隘的阶级偏见反动的盲目性
    这位英国记者的这些观察帮助了读者了解目前英美外交政策遭受多次败北的原因。其先天的缺点是狭隘的阶级偏见，反动的盲目性，惊人的狭窄世界观，对广大人民的极度轻视和顽固否认各民族争取自由独立的合法愿望。
    美英统治阶级曾经盼望等战争终了，苏联精疲力竭，被迫屈服的时候，便会开放门户欢迎外国的资本，舍弃了社会主义的成就了。这种盼望使英美驻莫斯科的外交人员收集，更常地是伪造一些最可笑最恶毒的言论，把这种言论送给他们的政府和发给报纸，以便欺骗人民。在战争时期，他们造出恶意而愚蠢的故事，说苏维埃国家在放弃共产主义了；战后他们又造谣说苏联已经软弱无力，不然就反过来说苏联是个有侵略性的国家。
    这种反苏专家伪造出来的胡说八道的谣言由大使馆散布到新闻记者手中，再由他们传到资本主义国家的报纸上。
    巴克追记在莫斯科外长会议时，英国大使馆如何豢养被认为可以使英国人了解讨论德国问题经过情形的访问记者们。英国报纸长驻莫斯科的记者则受到冷淡的待遇，他们不被信任。英国外交部人员随身带了可靠的“外交记者”到莫斯科，记者们把这些人称为“驯服的海狗”，或是“卧室的侍者”。这些“驯服的海狗”接受指示制造英国舆论，使它与英美政府对德国的帝国主义路线一致，与他们对波茨坦协定的破坏，和他们反和平的阴谋等一致。外交记者每晚都聚集在英国代表团官方发言人的旅馆房间里。这种集合渐渐被叫做“简短会议”，这本是对在轰炸飞行员出发以前指示要机的军事谈话的称呼。在每一个简短会议以后，这些记者便用另一批伪造的消息和反苏谣言对英国人民轰炸起来。
            英国大使馆替他们的记者们预备好了一大批对苏联的政治、经济
        、文化的歪曲报导
    英国大使馆给他们预备好了一大批对苏联生活各方面——政治、经济、文化和教育等的歪曲报导。美国大使馆也对美国记者发给同样的报导。根据这种早已做好的大使馆的摘要，华德、威尔士和其他记者便写出他们的伪观察和伪印象记了。巴克说在莫斯科美国新闻记者主要是从事把这些大使馆报告抄写在他们的笔记本上。这些报告多半是荒诞的捏造：假造的统计，想象的故事，空洞的谈话，都是他们制造的。一个记者曾根据他声称由一位叫米莎的俄国女孩子听来的话，做了一篇胡说的文章！
    巴克写了英国在莫斯科的外交官的生活与习惯。他给英国大使绘画真像。克尔爵士是以卑贱著名的，他向美国战争贩子的最有力的代理人之一的凯南叩了头。彼得逊爵士是一个冷静的老派外交家，被币制改革弄得恐慌失措，这种改革制止了许多高级外交官的货币投机事业。
    一九四四年到一九四七年驻莫斯科的英国公使罗伯特，现任印度的助理高级专员，他不倦地收集反苏谣言和讥讽。这位外交官利用每一个机会灌输对苏战争不可避免的观念。罗伯特的后继者哈里逊也走同一路线，这种路线来自美国大使馆。
            战时英美在莫斯科大使馆的整个活动就是间谍工作
    早在战争时期，巴克就看到了许多不同国家的外交家团结在一起不是共同反对希特勒主义，却是共同来反对苏联。反苏外交集团甚至于有一个由各大使馆间谍收集来的有关苏联消息的“宝库”。英美在莫斯科大使馆的整个活动就是间谍工作。英国最著名间谍之一的乔治·希尔在战时被任为驻莫斯科高级外交人员不是没有目的的。希尔是一九一七年到一九一八年在俄国的间谍，也是一本无耻地叫做《去侦探那土地罢》的书的作者，在这书里他鼓吹反对苏联的间谍和破坏工作。
    当苏军正与希特勒匪帮作战，援救了英国三岛免受法西斯奴役的时候，英国外交人员却在莫斯科建立一个反苏的破坏阵线。在他们周围集合了波兰的反动派，这些人那时候并不掩饰他们对苏的敌对态度，并且给英国大使馆收集谍报资料。他们梦想着战后在波兰夺取政权，煽动反对开辟第二战线，要西方国家的军队经巴尔干从南方先入波兰。他们希冀着组织统治巴尔干的波兰捷克联盟。巴克说声名狼籍的英国间谍洛克哈特和邱吉尔的私人副官卡查勒曾积极地参与这一事件的准备工作，后者的家庭从前在沙俄有大宗经济利益。
    但是给与伦敦波兰人和他们对苏联与波兰民主的阴谋举动的支持不过是英大使馆反苏活动的一项而已。巴克把这些事件详细说明的原故，根据他的意见说，是为了明显地指出苏联人民与希特勒德国进行紧张与英勇的斗争时英国统治阶级的可耻的阴谋。
            英国外交只是成了美国外交的应声虫
    对于研究英美战后外交政策的人，这种反和平阴谋是更加明显的。华盛顿是这种政策的中心。英国外交毫无问题地只是成了美国外交的应声虫而已。
    巴克谈到英国在莫斯科的外交人员向他们的美国同僚叩头的可悲。英法大使馆是从属于美大使馆的。
    “从一九四四年开始，”巴克写着，“对于每一个对苏联政府的外交洽商，三个大使馆都是一致的，由美国的意见左右一切。”
    美国外交人员在外交团中开始占有领导地位。他们选出了反苏阴谋的专家，象凯南那样的人。关于这位苏联和人民民主国家的死敌已经写了很多。但巴克又给加添了几笔。高傲、无知而又目中无人的这位灭亡着的资本主义社会的化身，凯南带着轻蔑地宣称，欧洲大陆——
    “住着一群无精打采的，管治不善的，精疲力竭的该受美国中产阶级领导的人民。”
    在他的愚蠢的自信中，他相信苏联人民在胜利的时候一定会“精疲力竭”了。甚至早在炮火未停以前，这个魔鬼就谈起了新战争。
    莫斯科的胜利日。满街是狂欢的群众。马苛瓦亚大街上的美国大使馆的窗户表示不赞成地紧闭着。大使馆顾问凯南，握有秘密反苏外交枢纽的人物，站在一个窗帘边后向街上偷看。巴克听见他冷酷地喃喃说道：
    “他们在欢呼……他们以为战争过去了，但是战争不过是刚刚开始。”
    凯南和他的帮凶所发动的战争就是“冷战”，是“燕尾服与匕首”的卑污的战争，是诡计、挑拨、中伤的战争。
            英国外交部还是由当年鼓吹对纳粹侵略者采取“绥靖”手段的人
        把持着
    外交团的霉烂的气氛，还有他们的反苏阴谋和无聊的酒会并没有因为英国工党的上台而有所改变。不顾竞选时的诺言，工党政府正在执行邱吉尔的反苏外交政策。英国外交厨房的厨子也没更换一下。
    英国外交部还是由当年鼓吹对纳粹侵略者采取绥靖手段的人把持着，象克巴揣克爵士和威廉·史特朗这类人。英国外交部唯一新的活动是为了在别国扩大间谍网所创立的各种新部门和特种谍报机关。对于苏联和新民主国家，英国外交部主要的任务用巴克的话说就是集中于“如何组织一个可靠谍报机关的问题”。
    现在有另一件事使贝文的外交部特别重视，这就是在英国和其他国家里的通过报纸与无线电的宣传工作。因为艾德里——贝文的外交政策是一个反人民的政策，所以它需要一个欺骗人民和隐瞒或歪曲事实真象的强有力的宣传机器。供给这个机器以必须的资料是新谍报组织的任务。
    英国外交部正努力在苏联人民和对苏联感到深厚兴趣的英国人民之间筑起一道鸿沟。不但没做出什么满足这一兴趣的事，相反的，外交部所指挥的宣传机器正向人民灌输由诡诈的记者，造谣者，卖国贼，叛徒们所捏造的大批谎言。目的是在降低苏联在英国人民之间的声望，激起对苏联的猜疑和不信任，因为苏联的和平政策对于战争贩子的计划是一个障碍，并且粉碎了他们反对和平的阴谋。
            巴克发表笔录目的是使全世界人民了解战争贩子们反对和平的阴谋
    巴克所以决心发表他的笔录是为了使全世界的人民看见正在出卖和平并驱使各国走进另一次战争去的人们的反和平政策。他的书对于英国外交政策决策者是一个严重的打击。正如最近另一位英国记者，前《英国同盟者》报的编者约翰斯顿所做的暴露，巴克的笔录在一种意义上是一件非常重大的事件。它揭露了英美战争贩子卑贱下流的阴谋。（译自新时代第四十三期）
