Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 23rd: The press office published an obituary from the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party to its members and the Bulgarian people, stating: Comrade Vasil Kolarov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, loyal son of the Bulgarian working class and the Bulgarian people, closest comrade-in-arms of Georgi Dimitrov, and outstanding leader of the international labor movement, passed away on January 23, 1950, after a long illness.

Comrade Kolarov was born on July 16, 1877, in the town of Shumen to a craftsman's family. Comrade Kolarov began studying the works of Marx as early as the age of fifteen. During his time as a university student, he became the organizer and leader of an illegal student group studying Marxism and participated in the struggle against the Stambolov regime.

In 1895, Comrade Kolarov was appointed as a teacher at the three-year school in Nikopol, where he conducted large-scale socialist propaganda. Due to this activity, he was dismissed from the school.

In 1897, he joined the Party.

After being dismissed, Comrade Kolarov went to France and Switzerland to study law and jurisprudence. In 1902, upon returning to his homeland from abroad, he launched in-depth propaganda of socialist ideas and delivered fierce speeches against the bourgeois opposition parties at meetings and gatherings.

Comrade Kolarov most actively participated on the side of Dimitar Blagoev and Georgi Kirkov in their struggle against the enemies of the Party. Through speeches, articles, and reports, he fought for the establishment of a revolutionary Marxist party of the Bulgarian proletariat. At the time of the split, Comrade Kolarov resolutely stood on the side of Dimitar Blagoev and Georgi Kirkov.

In 1904, Comrade Kolarov, in accordance with the decision of the Central Committee of the Party, moved to Plovdiv to lead the Party organization in this second largest city in Bulgaria. In Plovdiv, Comrade Kolarov led the Party organization for a long time, demonstrating that he was a mature and far-sighted political leader, an outstanding orator, a spokesperson for the people, a passionate propagandist, and an experienced journalist and political commentator.

In 1905, Comrade Kolarov was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Party. After the Balkan Wars, the working people of Plovdiv and the Plovdiv region elected him to the National Assembly, where Comrade Kolarov delivered inspiring and well-reasoned speeches against the bourgeois government and the criminal nationalist and plundering policies implemented by the Coburg dynasty's agents of German imperialism.

During World War I, Comrade Kolarov waged a resolute struggle to prevent Bulgaria from being dragged into the imperialist war.

In 1915 and 1917, he participated in the Zimmerwald and Stockholm international socialist conferences.

Together with the entire Party and the most progressive sections of the Bulgarian people, Comrade Kolarov enthusiastically hailed the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia and the victory of the Soviet regime.

In speeches, reports, and pamphlets, Comrade Kolarov explained the epoch-making significance of the October Socialist Revolution for the liberation of all working humanity, defended the young Soviet Republic against provocations organized by its enemies, and exposed the so-called Entente imperialist armies' plans for aggression. Comrade Kolarov repeatedly represented the Party in demanding that the Bulgarian bourgeois government recognize the Soviet government.

As the secretary of the Party, Comrade Kolarov carried out a great deal of work to expose the coup d'état of the Bulgarian fascist bourgeois monarchists, which was arranged with the help of the Wrangel White Guard bandits.

The outstanding leader of the international labor movement, Comrade Kolarov, was elected as the General Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Communist International.

Following the royalist-fascist coup of June 9, 1923, Comrade Kolarov illegally and secretly returned to Bulgaria to help the Party correct the erroneous line regarding this coup.

Comrade Kolarov, together with Comrade Dimitrov, actively participated in preparing the glorious people's anti-fascist October Uprising of 1923. This uprising became a turning point in the Bolshevization of the Party and gave the Party great prestige among the broad masses. This uprising was led by Comrades Dimitrov and Kolarov.

After the failure of the uprising, Comrades Dimitrov and Kolarov published a historic open letter to the Bulgarian people, filled with Bolshevik optimism about the inevitable final victory of the working people of Bulgaria over the reactionaries under the leadership of the glorious Bulgarian Communist Party. After the failure of the uprising, when opportunists and left-leaning sectarianists appeared within the Party, Comrade Kolarov, together with Comrade Dimitrov, resolutely fought to defeat them.

While in exile abroad, Comrade Kolarov never ceased to pay close attention to the evolution of political events in Bulgaria, never ceased to struggle against the bloody fascist police terror, and strove to liberate the Bulgarian people from royalist-fascist enslavement.

When Comrade Dimitrov was arrested by the Nazis, Kolarov actively engaged in a broad international movement to expose the Hitlerite butchers and warmongers, dedicating himself to securing Dimitrov's swift release.

During the period of Hitler's military aggression, Comrade Kolarov, as Comrade Dimitrov's closest partner and comrade-in-arms, used all his energy to organize the people of Bulgaria to resist the German Hitlerite aggressors and their Bulgarian royalist fascist henchmen and servants.

As Comrade Dimitrov's closest companion and comrade-in-arms, Comrade Kolarov actively engaged in the establishment and strengthening of the Fatherland Front after the victory of the people's uprising on September 9 – thanks to his rich political experience and comprehensive knowledge.

In September 1947, the national referendum enabled our people to eliminate the monarchy and establish a republic.

In his capacity as Chairman of the National Assembly, Kolarov also served as acting President of the Republic.

In his capacity as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and head of the Bulgarian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, Kolarov, with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet delegation, protected the interests of Bulgaria and the Bulgarian people, for which he earned the eternal gratitude of the Bulgarian people.

Kolarov – Dimitrov’s closest companion and comrade-in-arms – was one of the most outstanding and meritorious builders of socialism in our homeland.

After the death of our unforgettable leader and teacher Dimitrov caused us an irreparable loss, Kolarov took office as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria, implementing national policies. He worked in this position with enormous self-sacrifice until his last breath.

After the Information Bureau exposed the Tito clique’s vile betrayal in Yugoslavia, Kolarov and the entire Party, together with the Central Committee, waged a resolute struggle against the Titoists, who acted as lackeys of imperialism and instigators of new wars.

Kolarov played the most active role in uncovering, exposing, and eliminating the spy and saboteur gang of Kostov.

Throughout his life, Kolarov always held high the banner of proletarian internationalism and was an enthusiastic fighter for Bulgarian-Soviet friendship. Until his last breath, he remained loyal to the great cause of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and loyal to the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

After the early death of our teacher and leader Dimitrov caused us an irreparable loss, we have now suffered another major loss. We have lost Kolarov – the closest, oldest, and most loyal comrade-in-arms of our teacher and leader.

Party members must unite more closely around the Party’s Dimitrov Central Committee and make the greatest efforts to strengthen the Party’s unity. The working people must unite more closely around Dimitrov’s Party.

We must expose the enemies of the Party and the people with greater force and render them powerless.

Our Party will have sufficient strength to bravely and firmly raise the banner of the socialist struggle, advancing further and further, and completely realizing Dimitrov’s legacy.

Our Party and our people will never forget the outstanding contributions and brilliant example of Comrade Kolarov – the loyal comrade-in-arms of the immortal leader Dimitrov.

We bow our heads in mourning to his heroic spirit.
                                      The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party
                              January 23, 1950, in Sofia

    科拉罗夫同志于一八七七年七月十六日生于苏曼城一个工匠的家庭。科拉罗夫同志早在十五岁的时候，就开始学习马克思的著作。在高等学校的学生时期，他成为研究马克思主义的非法学生小组的组织者和领袖，并参加了反对斯坦波洛夫政权的斗争。
    一八九五年，科拉罗夫同志被任命为尼科波尔三年学校的教师，他在学校大规模地进行社会主义宣传。因为这种活动，他被学校开除。
    一八九七年，他参加了党。
    科拉罗夫同志在被开除之后即赴法国和瑞士研究法律和法理学。一九○二年，当他从国外返回故乡后，他展开了深入的社会主义思想的宣传，并在会议和集会上对资产阶级反对党发表了反对的激烈的演说。
    科拉罗夫同志在季米特利·布拉哥也夫和格奥尔基·基尔科夫与党的敌人进行斗争时，最积极地参加了他们这方面。他以演说、文章和报告，为建立保加利亚无产阶级的革命的马克思主义的政党而斗争。在发生分裂的时候，科拉罗夫同志坚决地站在季米特利·布拉哥也夫和格奥尔基·基尔科夫方面。
    一九○四年，科拉罗夫同志遵照党的中央委员会的决定迁往普罗夫第夫，以便在这一保加利亚的第二大城里，领导党的组织。在普罗夫第夫，科拉罗夫同志长时间领导了党的组织，并显示出他是一个成熟而有远见的政治领袖、出众的演说家、人民的代言人、热情的宣传家和有经验的新闻记者与政论家。
    一九○五年，科拉罗夫同志被选为党的中央委员。在巴尔干战争之后，普罗夫第夫和普罗夫第夫区的劳动人民把他选入国民议会，科拉罗夫同志曾经在议会发表了鼓舞人心的理由确凿的演说，反对资产阶级政府和德国帝国主义者的科堡王朝代理人所实行的罪恶的民族主义的和掠夺的政策。

    继一九二三年六月九日保皇法西斯政变之后，科拉罗夫同志非法的秘密回到保加利亚，帮助党纠正对于这次政变的错误路线。
    科拉罗夫同志与季米特洛夫同志一同积极地参加准备一九二三年光辉的人民反法西斯的十月起义。这一起义成为党布尔什维克化的转折点，并使党在广大群众中得到巨大威信，这次起义就是季米特洛夫和科拉罗夫同志所领导的。
    起义失败之后，季米特洛夫和科拉罗夫同志发表了致保加利亚人民的历史性的公开信，其中对于保加利亚劳动人民在光辉的保加利亚共产党领导下的必然最后战胜反动派，充满了布尔什维克的乐观。在起义失败之后，当党内出现了机会主义者和左倾宗派主义分子的时候，科拉罗夫同志与季米特洛夫一起坚决地进行了击溃他们的斗争。

    季米特洛夫同志被纳粹逮捕时，科拉罗夫即积极从事于广泛的国际运动，揭发希特勒屠夫和战争贩子，致力于使季米特洛夫迅速获得释放。
    在希特勒军事侵略期间，科拉罗夫同志，作为季米特洛夫同志最亲密的伙伴和战友，用他所有的精力，组织保加利亚的人民，以抵抗德国希特勒侵略者和他们的保加利亚保皇党法西斯走狗和奴仆。
    作为季米特洛夫最亲密的同伴和战友，科拉罗夫同志在九月九日人民起义胜利之后，便积极从事于——有赖于他的丰富的政治经验和全面的知识——祖国阵线的建立与力量的加强。
    一九四七年九月，全国投票复决，我们的人民消灭了君主政权，建立了人民共和国政权。
    以国民议会主席的资格，科拉罗夫也担任了共和国代理主席的职务。
    以保加利亚人民共和国外交部长和巴黎和平会议保加利亚代表团团长的资格，在苏联代表团兄弟般的协助之下，科拉罗夫宝贵地维护了保加利亚和保加利亚人民的利益，由于这，他赢得了保加利亚人民永远的感谢。
    科拉罗夫——季米特洛夫最亲密的同伴和战友——是我们祖国社会主义建设者的最杰出、最有功勋的一个。
    我们的永志不忘的领袖和导师季米特洛夫逝世之后，科拉罗夫就任保加利亚部长会议主席执行国家大政。他担任这个职位，以巨大的自我牺牲精神进行工作，直至最后一息。
    在情报局揭露了南斯拉夫铁托集团卑劣的叛变之后，科拉罗夫和整个党与中央委员会一起，对充当帝国主义和新战争挑拨者的走狗的铁托分子进行了坚决的斗争。
    科拉罗夫对于破获、揭露与消灭科斯托夫的间谍与破坏者匪帮，起了最积极的作用。
    科拉罗夫在他的一生中一直高举着无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，而且是主张保苏友好的热情斗士。直到最后一息，他始终忠于马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大事业、忠于苏联和苏联共产党。
    由于我们的导师和领袖季米特洛夫的早逝使我们遭受了无法弥补的损失之后，我们现在又遭受了一个重大的损失。我们已丧失了科拉罗夫——我们的导师和领袖的最亲密、最老和最忠诚的战友。
    党员们必须更紧密地团结在党的季米特洛夫中央委员会的周围，并尽最大的努力加强党的团结。劳动人民必须更紧密地团结在季米特洛夫的党的周围。
    我们必须以更大的力量揭露党与人民的敌人，并使其无能为害。
    我们党将具有充分的力量，勇敢地、坚定地举起社会主义的战斗旗帜前进再前进，并彻底实现季米特洛夫的遗训。
    我们党和我国人民将永远不会忘记科拉罗夫同志——不朽的领袖季米特洛夫的忠实的战友——的杰出的贡献和光辉的榜样。
    我们向他的英灵俯首致哀。
                                      保加利亚共产党中央委员会
                              一九五○年一月二十三日于索非亚
