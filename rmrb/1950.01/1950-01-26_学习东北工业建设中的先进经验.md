    Learning from the Advanced Experience of Industrial Construction in Northeast China
    Tian Liu

    Since the launch of the movement to create new production records in state-owned and public enterprises in Northeast China in October of last year, it has expanded to all factories and mines in Northeast China, becoming a mass movement in which hundreds of thousands of workers enthusiastically participate. Thousands of instances of saving raw materials, reducing costs, increasing production, improving quality, reforming tools, improving labor organization and management methods, and reforming the work style of cadres are emerging every day. This unprecedented mass movement is changing the face of Northeast China's industry and guiding Northeast China's industrial construction onto a new stage.

    How did the movement to create new production records in Northeast China develop? How should industrial and mining enterprises across the country treat and accept this advanced experience?

    After the complete liberation of Northeast China in November 1947, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the active participation and assistance of the vast number of workers, the work of taking over various factories and mines was rapidly and successfully completed, and production was resumed. However, due to the lack of industrial management experience among cadres, and the embezzlement and corruption of some holdover personnel whose ideology had not been reformed, serious waste existed in enterprises. In light of this situation, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government issued instructions last summer on opposing waste and implementing an economic accounting system. After receiving the instructions from the Industrial Department, workers in various factories and mines launched an extremely enthusiastic anti-waste struggle in July and August. In the increasingly in-depth anti-waste struggle, it was discovered that the biggest waste was the failure to fully utilize the efficiency of machines and low productivity. At the same time, it was realized that without scientific "quota management," it would be impossible to conduct accurate cost accounting, and therefore there would be no perfect economic accounting system. Since implementing "quota management" is the basic link of the economic accounting system, where is the "quota"? Most of the industrial data from the puppet Manchukuo era were destroyed and lost by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang. Although some factories could find "technical quotas" for some types of work, they were not entirely suitable for the new situation. With the pride of being masters of the country, the working class in Northeast China rejected the "slave quotas when they were slaves of a conquered country" and wanted to create "their own master quotas." Thus, under the advocacy of advanced workers Zhao Guoyou, Zhang Shangju, and others, and with the active support and leadership of the Northeast China Communist Party and the People's Government, the movement to create new production records spread like wildfire, and by the end of October, it had spread throughout all mines and factories in Northeast China.

    The movement to create new production records, which has been successfully carried out for three months and is still developing enthusiastically, is promoting Northeast China's industrial construction towards a new high tide. How to learn from the advanced experience of this remarkable achievement in Northeast China's industrial construction has become an urgent problem that needs to be solved by workers and economic workers across the country, as well as all people who care about the construction of the motherland. Mechanical copying that is inflexible and unchanging will certainly not achieve the expected results; on the contrary, it may cause huge losses in work. However, a conservative attitude that rejects and despises this successful experience will inevitably cause unnecessary losses to the enterprise. In order to better promote and learn from the advanced experience of industrial construction in Northeast China, it is useful to briefly talk about the main situation of Northeast China's industry before the launch of the new record movement. At that time, the main industrial and mining area of Northeast China - South Manchuria - had just been liberated for more than half a year (similar to the current industrial cities in North China, Central China, and East China). After protecting the factories and taking over, most of the factories and mines had resumed production. Preliminary political education and democratic movements had been carried out among the workers, and the workers' awareness had been raised, but cadres still lacked management experience. Therefore, when the launch of the new record movement was proposed, many enterprise management cadres and technicians raised "difficulties" and "reasons" such as "cadres do not understand technology and have no experience," "raw material supply is not timely," and "production is not normal and the organization is not sound," believing that the new record movement could not be launched. This thinking was forcefully criticized by the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Industrial Department of the People's Government from the beginning, pointing out that it was an erroneous thinking of "conservatism and backwardness, lacking a mass viewpoint." Later facts proved that the Northeast Bureau and the Industrial Department were correct. When many enterprise management cadres accepted the instructions of the Northeast Bureau and overcame their conservative views in the ideological struggle of "fighting the first battle against themselves," they went deep into the front lines and participated in the movement to create new production records with the workers. During this period, there emerged typical examples of Comrade Xu Hongwen, deputy manager of Benxi Coal and Iron Company, leading engineers and technicians to go deep into the mine to experiment with tunneling; the chairman of the trade union of Andong Machinery Factory going deep into the workshop and creating the experience of the trade union leading the new record movement, enabling the trade union work to escape from the quagmire of formalism and bureaucracy and truly become the promoter and mobilizer of production; the Communist Party branch of Harbin Tram Factory also found the key to ensuring the creation of the new record movement. The factory administration, the Party, the trade union, and their cadres all began to gain factory management experience and production knowledge, and further realized that it is impossible or rarely possible to quickly gain management experience and production knowledge by sitting in the office. This knowledge can only be obtained by going deep into the front lines and into the movement. As for "untimely supply of raw materials" and "abnormal production and unsound organization," these are even excuses for the lazy. The experience of Northeast China also proves that it is natural to carry out the new record movement after necessary preparation work, but it must never wait until "everything is ready" before carrying out the movement, because the new record movement itself is the best way to normalize production and improve the organization. In Northeast China, with the development and deepening of the new record movement, many mines and factories changed the old methods of labor organization and management institutions, established new production systems and labor discipline, and began to formulate their own "quotas" for raw materials, quantity, quality, and other aspects, so it was possible to carry out cost accounting and implement enterprise management based on economic accounting. At present, the industrial situation in the country is the same as the industrial situation in Northeast China half a year ago. The takeover and resumption of production have been completed, and the education and workers' movement of workers have achieved preliminary results. The basic conditions for accepting and learning from this advanced experience in industrial construction in Northeast China have gradually been met. The key issue is to overcome the conservative thinking among employees, especially the conservatism in the thinking of enterprise leaders. As for what form to take to accept and learn from this advanced experience in Northeast China, it depends on one's specific situation and conditions. In the past, various production competition movements, merit-making movements, and model worker movements that have been carried out in various places more than once are essentially movements to create new production records, but they are not as regular, sustained, widespread, in-depth, and comprehensive as the movement carried out in Northeast China. Regardless of the name and form, as long as factory administrative cadres, Communist Party branches, and trade unions regularly, keenly, and promptly discover, cultivate, reward, and promote the advanced experience of advanced producers—all kinds of new records—they will drive the vast number of workers to take active action and become a mass production movement to create records.

    学习东北工业建设中的先进经验
    田流
    东北国营公营企业中的创造生产新纪录运动，从去年十月开展以来，已扩及全东北一切工厂矿山，成为数十万职工热烈参加的群众性的运动。成千百件节省原料、减低成本、增加产量、提高质量，改造工具，改善劳动组织与经营管理方法，以及改造干部作风的新纪录天天涌现。这个规模空前的群众运动正在改变着东北工业的面貌，正在导引着东北工业建设走上一个全新的阶段。
    东北创造生产新纪录运动是怎样开展起来的？全国各地工矿企业应该怎样对待和接受这一先进经验呢？
    一九四七年十一月东北全部解放后，各厂矿在共产党与人民政府领导下，在广大职工积极参加帮助中，迅速胜利的完成接管工作，并复工生产了。但由于干部缺乏管理工业的经验，部分思想未改造的留用人员又假公济私贪污腐化，企业中存在着严重的浪费现象。东北人民政府工业部根据此种情况，遂于去年夏季发出关于反对浪费实行经济核算制的指示。各厂矿职工接到工业部指示后，便在七、八月间掀起了异常热烈的反浪费斗争。在日益深入的反浪费斗争中，发觉最大的浪费是机器效能未能充分发挥和生产力低下，同时也体会到没有科学的“定额管理”，便不可能进行精确的成本计算，因此也就不会有完善的经济核算制。既然实行“定额管理”是经济核算制的基本环节，那么“额”在那里呢？伪满时代的工业资料，大部被日寇和国民党糟坍遗失了，个别工厂中虽然可以找到一部分工种的“技术定额”，但也不完全适合新情况的需要。东北工人阶级以国家主人翁的自豪鄙弃了那“做亡国奴时的奴隶定额”，要创造“自己的主人的定额”，于是在先进工人赵国有、张尚举等倡导下，在东北共产党与人民政府积极赞助领导下，创造生产新纪录运动如野火燎原，十月下旬就燃遍东北各矿厂。
    已经胜利地进行了三个月并仍在热烈开展着的创造生产新纪录运动，正推动着东北工业建设走向新的高潮。如何学习东北工业建设中这一卓著成效的先进经验，就成为全国职工和经济工作者以及关心祖国建设的全体人民迫切需要解决的问题了。死拉硬扯一成不变的机械搬用，固然不会得到预期的效果，相反的，还可能造成工作中的巨大损失；但对此成功经验加以拒绝和轻视的保守态度，也必然会给企业招致不必要的损失。为着更好的推广和学习东北工业建设中的先进经验，简单谈一谈东北工业在新纪录运动开展前的主要情况是有益的。当时东北主要工矿区——南满刚刚解放半年多（和目前华北、华中、华东等工业城市相似）各厂矿经过护厂接管后，大都复工生产了，在工人中已进行了初步的政治教育和民主运动，工人的觉悟已经提高，但干部还很缺乏管理经验。因此在提出开展新纪录运动时，许多企业管理干部和技术人员提出：“干部不懂技术没经验”，“原材料供应不及时”，“生产不正常、机构不健全”等等“困难”和“理由”，认为不能开展新纪录运动。这种思想一开始就被中共中央东北局及人民政府工业部有力的批判了，指出那是“保守落后，缺乏群众观点”的错误思想。后来的事实证明东北局和工业部是正确的。当许多企业管理干部接受了东北局的指示，在“第一仗先向自己打”的思想斗争中克服了自己的保守主义观点后，纷纷深入现场，和工人一起参加创造生产新纪录运动。这期间涌现了本溪煤铁公司副经理徐宏文同志领导工程师技术人员深入矿井试验掘进的典型事例；安东机械厂工会主任深入车间，创造了工会领导新纪录运动的经验，使工会工作从形式主义事务主义的泥沼中脱出，而真正成为生产的推进者和鼓动者；哈尔滨电车厂共产党支部也找到了保证创造生产新纪录运动的门径。工厂行政、党、工会及其干部都开始获得工厂管理经验与生产知识，进一步体会到坐在办公室里是不可能或很少可能迅速获得管理经验与生产知识的，这些知识只有在深入现场深入运动中才能获得。至于“原材料供应不及时”，“生产不正常、机构不健全”等等，更是懒惰者的借口。东北的经验同样证明：有必要的准备工作后，再来开展新纪录运动自然是应该的，但绝不能等待“万事俱备”再进行运动，因为新纪录运动本身正是使生产正常、机构健全的最好方法。在东北，随着新纪录运动的开展和深入，许多矿厂改变了旧的劳动组织和管理机构的办法，建立起新的生产制度和劳动纪律，开始制定自己原材料、数质、量等各方面的“定额”，因此也就有可能进行成本计算，实行经济核算制的企业化管理了。目前全国工业状况，正像半年前东北工业状况一样，完成了接管和复工生产了，工人教育与工人运动已有初步成绩，接受和学习东北工业建设中这一先进经验的基本条件已渐具备，关键问题是克服职工间的保守思想，特别是企业领导思想上的保守主义。至于采取何种形式来接受和学习东北这一先进经验，则要看自己的具体情况和条件。过去，各地曾经不止一次开展过的生产竞赛运动、立功运动、劳模运动等等，本质上都是创造生产新纪录运动，只不过不如东北开展得经常持久、广泛深入和全面完整而已。不管名称和形式如何，只要工厂行政干部、共产党支部及工会经常锐敏及时的发现、培养、奖励和推广先进生产者的先进经验——各种各样的新纪录，就会带动广大职工群众积极行动起来，而成为群众性的创造纪录的生产运动。
