    Preparing for Mass Production to Prevent Smallpox
    Lu Zhongnan Deploys Vaccination
    [This newspaper dispatch] In Tai'ning, Pingyi, and other areas of the Lu Zhongnan Administrative Region of Shandong Province, smallpox outbreaks began in November of last year. In response, the Lu Zhongnan Administrative Office issued instructions on December 27, requiring all localities to vigorously carry out vaccination campaigns in conjunction with spring production and disaster relief work to prevent the spread of smallpox. The instructions stipulated that governments at all levels should be responsible, with leaders taking charge, making thorough plans, rapidly deploying, and leading the health departments and other relevant organs (such as civil affairs, education, and public security departments), and combining with the organizations of the Women's Federation and the Youth Federation to establish anti-epidemic committees at all levels to powerfully lead the work of vaccinating against smallpox. In terms of implementation steps, cities, market towns, stations, government offices, factories, and schools should be vaccinated as a priority. In old liberated areas, various health and epidemic prevention organizations should be strengthened; in new liberated areas, health institutions should be established as much as possible, and anti-epidemic committees or district medical associations should be organized to systematically and step-by-step vaccinate infants and children. In disaster-stricken areas, vaccination should be carried out in conjunction with disaster relief efforts. Organizational work and propaganda work should be combined. When medical departments and local health committees are organized, they must earnestly study smallpox and vaccination knowledge, and widely publicize and carry out vaccination among the masses through primary schools, farmers' associations, and youth organizations. In rural areas, primary school teachers should be the main vaccination personnel, and teachers should be selected and trained in vaccination work first; in cities, personnel from hospitals and health agencies can be organized or a group of students can be trained to carry out vaccination work. The instructions also pointed out that treating complications is the main task after vaccination. After vaccination is completed in cities, medical personnel should be organized to form inspection teams, and visit and treat various districts and villages on a scheduled basis, and understand the vaccination situation and public response in various places, and help guide rural vaccination work.
