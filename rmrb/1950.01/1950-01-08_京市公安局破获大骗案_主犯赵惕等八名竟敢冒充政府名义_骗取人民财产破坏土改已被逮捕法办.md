[Beijing News] The Beijing Public Security Bureau cracked a major fraud case on December 30th of last year, involving the "North China United Industrial Transportation Company," which impersonated the government to defraud the people of their property and sabotage land reform in the suburbs. The mastermind, Zhao Ti, and accomplices Cao Wenbin, Meng Zemin, Yang Zhenhuan, Cao Yonghong, Du Ping, Li Jinming, and Sun Hong, a total of eight swindlers, were arrested and brought to justice. During the preliminary investigation by the Public Security Bureau, the main culprit, Zhao Ti, confessed to consistently opposing the people's revolutionary cause, having served as a soldier and officer in the puppet Manchurian regime, the traitor Wang Jingwei's puppet government, and the Kuomintang bandit army. Regarding the details of this crime, the perpetrator confessed that, in order to defraud the people of their property, he colluded with Kuomintang stragglers Cao Wenbin, Meng Zemin, Yang Zhenhuan, Cao Yonghong, Du Ping, Li Jinming, and Sun Hong in July of last year. Without government approval, they brazenly impersonated government personnel and established the "North China United Xinmin Industrial Transportation Company" under the guise of a joint public-private enterprise. In August, they changed the name to "North China United Industrial Transportation Co., Ltd." Using this name, they engaged in fraud and deception everywhere, falsely claiming that everyone who invested would have a job, with a salary of 300 catties of millet per person, etc., leading more than 80 citizens to invest and be defrauded of more than 15 million yuan. In order to expand their fraudulent activities and for the purpose of defrauding more money, the criminals were preparing to establish branches in Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Baotou, Xi'an, and other places. In August, they even sheltered landlords' land and evaded land reform. They colluded with the landlord Zhu Keshan in Tian Village in the western suburbs, falsely claiming to establish a "Rural Sideline Experimental Factory," sending Cao Wenbin, Meng Zemin, and others to be responsible for "taking over" Zhu's land of more than 400 mu. Although it was opposed by the broad masses of farmers to no avail, the criminals had already sold many farm tools for their own use. After the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned of the above situation, on December 30th of last year, it closed down the "company" and arrested the mastermind Zhao Ti and the other seven accomplices, confiscating privately-made seals, stamps, and other items on the spot.
