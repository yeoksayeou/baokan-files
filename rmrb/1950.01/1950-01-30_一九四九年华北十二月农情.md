    North China's Agricultural Situation in December 1949

    Last December, the main focus of agricultural production in North China provinces was on preparations such as accumulating fertilizer, repairing land, and transporting coal. Additionally, winter leisure time was used to continue developing winter sideline occupations and handicraft production.

            Accumulating Fertilizer
    Regarding fertilizer accumulation: According to statistics from 26 counties in Shanxi Province, including Changzhi and Lucheng, one hundred million dan of fertilizer had been accumulated in a month and a half by the end of last December. Many regions completed their winter fertilizer accumulation with a spirit of competition. Hukuan County in Shanxi Province averaged 70 dan of fertilizer per mu; and attention was paid to improving techniques to enhance fertilizer effectiveness. Fuping and Quyang counties in Hebei Province accumulated 200,000 carts of fertilizer. Beisong Village in Mancheng County accumulated more than 13,600 carts of fertilizer, averaging over 4 carts per mu. The Ding County Special District also ordered 130,000 jin of oilseed cakes from oil presses, planning to issue them as loans this spring to farmers unable to afford fertilizer. In terms of preparing fuel, repairing farm tools, and repairing embankments, 59 villages in Yushe, Shanxi Province, gathered over 2.7 million jin of firewood, resolving the spring fuel issue; the Changzhi Special District built over 38,000 embankments. According to statistics from 27 counties in Shanxi Province, over 30,000 new and repaired old farm tools were added. In order to complete the plan of digging 8,460 wells next year, the Ding County Special District in Hebei Province issued 158.8 million yuan in water conservancy loans to support the start of brick kiln operations in various counties. Furthermore, during the winter slack season, Chahar Province rewarded farmers for exterminating ground squirrels, wolves, wild boars, wild rabbits, etc., to reduce their harm to agricultural production. This movement has now begun in some areas and has achieved certain results. To ensure that all preparations for agricultural production are well done, Shanxi and Hebei provinces have organized winter work inspection teams to go to the countryside to correct the phenomenon in some areas of only paying attention to sideline production and neglecting the organization of agricultural production preparations. In addition, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government trained over 1,200 agricultural cadres in Taiyuan, Changzhi, and other places. Qing County and Linzhang in Hebei Province, and Pingyao County in Shanxi Province also conducted agricultural technology and water conservancy technology training during the winter slack season. This will greatly help strengthen the leadership of agricultural production this year and improve agricultural production technology.

            Sideline Production
    In terms of handicraft and sideline production, in order to meet the needs of urban industry and restore agricultural production, all regions have paid attention to organizing and developing pig raising and weaving industries. Shanxi Province proposed a plan of one pig per five households. Beisong Village in Mancheng County, Hebei Province, with 202 households, raised 335 pigs, averaging 1.5 pigs per household. 14 villages in Qinshui County, Shanxi Province, developed the weaving industry, producing 28,000 carrying poles and over 4,500 baskets. Qingfeng County's First District in Pingyuan Province started by opening up sales channels for sideline products, organizing 300 mat-weaving farmers to resume work. In addition, all regions developed various types of handicraft and sideline production in accordance with local conditions to increase farmers' income. In order to supply raw materials to the Tianjin Chemical Factory, Hebei Province systematically organized Tianjin, Cangxian, Dingxian and other special districts to carry out mirabilite production. Eleven counties in the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province paid attention to organizing coal kiln production, and now 616 coal kilns have been restored. Jincheng, Wuxiang, and other four counties have restored and developed 760 smelting furnaces and finished-product furnaces. The transportation industry in Chahar Province is very active. In Chicheng County alone, over 3,000 carts have gone to northern Chahar for transportation and sales. The main experiences in developing winter sideline production in various regions are to pay attention to organization and planning, and to ensure the quality and sales of finished products under the leadership's control. In some places, production was blindly launched, production for the sake of production, which was opposed by the masses, and winter production became unorganized, which is worth noting.

    一九四九年华北十二月农情
    去年十二月，华北各省农业生产的主要内容在是积肥、修地、运煤等各项生产准备工作，其次是利用冬季空闲，继续开展冬季副业、手工业生产。
            积肥
    在积肥方面：据山西省长治、潞城等二十六个县统计，截至去年十二月底一个半月中，已积肥一万万担。不少地区以竞赛精神完成了冬季积肥。该省壶关县平均每亩积肥已达七十担；并注意了改良技术，提高肥料效用。河北省阜平、曲阳两县已积肥廿万车。满城县北宋村共积肥一万三千六百多车，平均每亩可获肥料四车以上。定县专区并向油坊订购油饼十三万斤，准备今春发贷给无力购肥的农民。在准备燃料、修置农具、修理地岸等方面，山西省榆社五十九个村打柴二百七十余万斤，解决了今春的燃料问题；长治专区垒地岸三万八千余个。另据山西省二十七个县统计已增置与修理新旧农具三万余件。河北省定县专区为完成明年打井八千四百六十眼计划，发放水利贷款一亿五千八百余万元，扶植各县砖窑业开工。此外，察哈尔省并利用冬闲，奖励农民扑灭地鼠、山狼、野猪、野兔等，以减少其对农业生产之危害。现这一运动已在部分地区展开，且已获得一定成绩。为保证将农业生产的一切准备工作做好，山西、河北两省均曾分别组织冬季工作检查组下乡，及时纠正了某些只注意搞副业生产忽视组织农业生产准备工作的现象。另外，山西省人民政府在太原、长治等地集训农业干部一千二百余人，河北省的青县、临漳，山西省的平遥等县，亦均利用冬闲分别进行了农业技术与水利技术的训练，这对加强今年农业生产的领导，与提高农业生产的技术会有很大帮助。
            副业生产
    在手工业、副业生产上，为适应城市工业及恢复农业生产需要，各地均注意组织与发展喂猪及编织业。山西省提出五户一猪的计划，河北满城县北宋村二百零二户，养猪三百三十五口，平均每户一口半猪。山西省沁水县十四个村发展的编制业，已造成扁担二万八千根，篓筐四千五百余件。平原省清丰县一区从打开副业产品销路入手，组织了三百户编席农民复业。此外各地皆因地制宜，发展了各种不同种类的手工业副业生产，以增加农民收入。河北省为供给天津化学工厂原料，有计划地组织了天津、沧县、定县等专区开展皮硝生产。山西省长治专区十一个县，注意组织煤窑生产，现已恢复煤窑六百一十六座。晋城、武乡等四县共恢复发展了炼炉和成货炉七百六十座，察哈尔省运输业非常活跃，仅赤城一县去察北跑运销的大车已逾三千辆。各地开展冬季副业生产中的主要经验是要注意组织性与计划性，从领导上注意掌握保证成品的质量与销路。有的地方由于只盲目的去发动生产，为生产而生产，遭到群众反对，冬季生产形成自流状态，是值得引起注意的。
