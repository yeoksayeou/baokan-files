    【Baoding Dispatch, January 20th】Agencies, organizations, and people from all walks of life in Baoding City, Hebei Province, warmly support the Beijing Military Control Commission in safeguarding national sovereignty and reclaiming the land of the former American, French, and Dutch barracks in the city. Zhang Qingchun, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said excitedly regarding this resolute patriotic action: "This is the demand of the people of the whole country for many years. We defeated the Kuomintang bandit gang with our own hands and kicked the imperialist invading forces out of China with our own feet. Only the Chinese people are the masters of the Chinese land." Hu Su, Director of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, said: "The Chinese people, who have been trampled on by imperialism for a long time, can finally hold their heads high. This just and righteous action is the Chinese people telling the imperialists: This is the era of the people! Your bloody dreams should wake up." The Hebei Provincial Women's Federation, the Hebei Provincial Youth League Working Committee, and Yu Li, President of the Hebei Provincial Government Supervisory Yuan, all expressed their warm support for this patriotic action by the Beijing Military Control Commission. In addition, workers from the Baoding New China Flour Mill, railway workers, and business people all expressed their support. Teachers and students from various schools in Baoding are enthusiastically carrying out publicity to the public about this with excitement.
