    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 29th—TASS, Paris, January 27th: French Communist Party parliamentarian General Bertie, during the Republic Senate's budget debate, sharply criticized France's participation in the aggressive Brussels Pact and Atlantic Pact. He pointed out that unless French policy undergoes fundamental revision, the German army will soon be restored. The French people are increasingly aware of the dangers of the French army being subordinate to foreign armies.
    General Bertie demanded an end to the Vietnam War, pointing out that peace in Vietnam is the unanimous desire of the French people. He also suggested reducing the funds earmarked for continuing the Vietnam War by 95 billion francs, and using 20 billion francs for the withdrawal of the expeditionary force.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 29th—According to TASS, Paris, January 28th: The French Communist Party's L'Humanité recently published an article by one of the leaders of the French Communist Party, Cachin, opposing the colonial war in Vietnam, stating that according to reports in the American newspapers, the Truman administration intends to recognize the Bảo Đại puppet regime in Vietnam and help him forcibly restore his rule. This intention reflects Truman's attempt to establish an American base in Asia in preparation for launching a war against the new China and the Soviet Union. The French government and the leaders of the Socialist Party support these plans, but the French people resolutely oppose continuing the Vietnam War and demand peace.

    加香著文揭露美帝阴谋利用保大
    【新华社北京二十九日电】塔斯社巴黎二十七日讯：法国共产党议员伯蒂将军在共和国参议院辩论预算时，尖锐批评法国参加侵略性的布鲁塞尔集团和大西洋集团。他指出：除非法国的政策有根本的修正，德国陆军很快就要恢复。法国人民愈来愈认识到法国陆军从属于外国陆军所招致的危险。
    伯蒂将军要求终结越南战争，指出对越南的和平是法国人民的一致愿望。他并建议预定用于继续越南战争的款项，减少九百五十亿法郎，而以二百亿法郎作撤回远征军之用。
    【新华社北京二十九日电】据塔斯社巴黎二十八日讯：法共人道报顷发表法共领袖之一加香所撰反对越南殖民战争的论文称：根据美国报纸的消息判断，杜鲁门政府打算承认越南的保大傀儡政权，并帮助他强行复辟。这一意图反映杜鲁门企图在亚洲建立美国基地，以备发动反对新中国及苏联的战争。法国政府和社会党领袖都支持这些计划，但法国人民坚决反对继续进行越南战争，并要求和平。
