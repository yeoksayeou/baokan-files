Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 25th—To convey the resolutions of the Asian Women's Congress and to arrange the future work of Korean women, the South Korean and North Korean Women's Alliances jointly convened a conference of all-Korean women activists here on the 21st. More than 2,000 women representatives from all walks of life across the country and South Korean female guerrillas attended the conference.

Park Chung-ae, Chairman of the North Korean Women's Alliance, pointed out in her report on the proceedings and resolutions of the Asian Women's Congress and the tasks of Korean women at the conference: "In this conference, I deeply realized a truth, that is, without the people's own regime, the true liberation of women is fundamentally impossible." She called on Korean women to stand at the forefront of Asian women alongside the great Soviet and Chinese women, to fight for the liberation of Asian women, and to fight for the unified independence of the motherland. Xu Zhengsuk, Minister of Culture and Propaganda of the Korean government, pointed out in her speech: In North Korea, female factory workers should learn from Soviet women, study technology, and rural women should study methods of developing production and becoming prosperous. Urban and rural women should bear important responsibilities for expanding and consolidating the armed forces. She also said: Korean women should also wage a resolute struggle against feudal superstition and strive to improve their culture.

Finally, the conference adopted a resolution on "Supporting the Resolutions of the Asian Women's Congress and the Tasks of Korean Women." After the meeting, a documentary film of the Asian Women's Congress was shown.
