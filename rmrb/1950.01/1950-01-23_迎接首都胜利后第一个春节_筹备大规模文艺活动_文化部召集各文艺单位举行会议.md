    To Welcome the First Spring Festival After the Victory in the Capital
    Preparing for Large-Scale Cultural Activities
    The Ministry of Culture Convened a Meeting of Various Cultural and Artistic Units
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, in conjunction with the Beijing Bureau of Culture and Education, convened representatives from over twenty units, including the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Chinese Dramatists Association, the Chinese Artists Association, the Chinese Musicians Association, the Central Academy of Drama, the Cultural Troupe of the North China Military Region, the Youth Art Theater, and the People's Art Theater, on the 16th and 17th of this month to discuss how to better carry out cultural and artistic propaganda activities for the first Spring Festival in Beijing after the victory. Vice Minister Zhou Yang of the Ministry of Culture chaired the meeting. He pointed out: In the past, the liberated areas used the masses' New Year entertainment habits to carry out cultural and artistic propaganda, reform old entertainment, and develop new art. This is one of the important practices in art after Chairman Mao's speech at the Forum on Literature and Art, and it should now be promoted nationwide. The capital should set an example.
    Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing emphasized the importance of using the Spring Festival to make new art more widely penetrate the masses and create a new artistic atmosphere in the capital during the Spring Festival. The meeting discussed and decided on the following main points of this year's Spring Festival cultural activities:
    (1) In addition to using theaters to stage new plays, various cultural troupes should also jointly lead mass Yangko teams and other groups in square performances. They should collaborate with old performers in amusement parks and, based on the experience of previous New Years, mobilize the opera community to sing more programs with new content. New and old cultural and artistic groups should be mobilized to perform for the army and go to factories and nearby rural areas for consolation performances.
    (2) The citizens of various districts should be systematically mobilized and organized to hold Yangko and other artistic performances at designated locations, with each professional cultural and artistic group responsible for technical guidance and assistance. Where possible, outstanding programs from each district should be selected to hold a city-wide Spring Festival grand performance and awards should be given. In terms of Yangko form, bizarre, and insulting costumes and performances that demean laborers must be eliminated. Performances should avoid blocking roads and hindering traffic.
    (3) In terms of New Year pictures, the All-China Artists Association, in conjunction with the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, will hold a large New Year picture exhibition (including factory touring exhibitions) and mobilize various bookstores to sell them on consignment. In terms of methods, it is planned to combine them with singing activities and promote sales in places such as Tianqiao.
    The meeting also decided to form a Spring Festival Art Work Committee composed of seventeen people, including Li Bozhao, Zhou Weizhi, Wang Yaping, and Ma Shaobo, with Li Bozhao in charge, to make specific plans and arrangements for the Spring Festival work and to formulate reward measures for outstanding performances and creations.
    In addition, regarding scientific popularization, it is planned to hold a scientific popularization exhibition at Changdian. The content will mainly be divided into maternal and child health (from young girls to childbirth), general scientific knowledge, etc., and a planning committee will be formed to promote this work.

    迎接首都胜利后第一个春节
    筹备大规模文艺活动
    文化部召集各文艺单位举行会议
    【本报讯】中央人民政府文化部会同北京文教局于本月十六、十七两日召集全国文联、剧协、美协、音协、中央戏剧学院、华北军区文工团、青年艺术剧院、人民艺术剧院等单位代表二十余人，讨论更好地开展北京市胜利后第一个春节的文艺宣传活动。会议由文化部周扬副部长主席。他指出：历年来，解放区利用群众新年娱乐习惯进行文艺宣传，改造旧的娱乐，发展新的文艺，这是毛主席文艺座谈会讲话以后文艺上重要实践之一，现在应在全国范围推广，首都更应做出模范。
    文化部沈雁冰部长强调指出利用春节使新文艺更广泛的深入群众，造成首都春节新的文艺风气。会上讨论并决定今年春节文艺活动大要如下：
    （一）各文工团除利用剧场上演新的剧目外，并应联合与领导群众秧歌队等进行广场表演。在游艺场与旧艺人联合演出，在新年经验基础上发动戏曲界演唱更多新内容的节目。发动新旧文艺团体做劳军演出，并到工厂与近郊农村去慰劳表演。
    （二）有计划的发动与组织各区市民，指定一定地点，分别举行秧歌以及其它艺术形式表演，并责成各专业文艺团体负责在技术上指导和帮助。在可能条件下，挑选各区优秀节目举行全市性的春节大会演，并进行评奖。秧歌形式上必须革除奇形怪状，侮辱劳动人民的化装与表演。表演时要避免拦路，妨碍交通。
    （三）在新年画方面，由全国美协，会同市文教局，举行年画大展览（包括工厂巡回展览），并发动各书店代售。在方法上拟与演唱活动相结合，到天桥等处推销。
    会上并决定由李伯钊、周巍峙、王亚平、马少波等十七人组成春节文艺工作委员会，由李伯钊负责，具体计划与布置春节工作，并拟定对优秀演出及创作的奖励办法。
    此外，关于科学普及方面，计划在厂甸举办科学普及展览会，内容主要分妇婴卫生（从少女到生产）、一般科学常识等，并组成计划委员会，负责推动这一工作。
