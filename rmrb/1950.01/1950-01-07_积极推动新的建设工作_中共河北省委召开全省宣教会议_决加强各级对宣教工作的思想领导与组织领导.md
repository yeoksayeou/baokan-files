    [This Newspaper's Report] The Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a provincial Party propaganda work conference from December 1st to 9th of last year. A total of 289 people attended, including propaganda chiefs from local, municipal, county, and town committees, as well as Party member cadres from provincial-level propaganda and education departments. The conference primarily addressed the ideological and organizational leadership of the Party's propaganda and education work, and also resolved specific work issues related to branch education, cadre education, and leadership work. This lays a favorable foundation for further carrying out propaganda and education work throughout the province under the new situation.

    At the beginning of the meeting, Jin Cheng, Minister of the Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Department, first conveyed the Provincial Party Committee's draft proposals on strengthening the Party's leadership over propaganda and education work and several specific tasks. After six days of group discussions, which included fifteen typical reports on relevant work experience, Lin Tie, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, gave a report on how to thoroughly and deeply inspect work, improve leadership methods, and establish departmental work. During the conference, Zhang Panshi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, came to provide guidance and gave a report on the new tasks of propaganda and education work under the new situation. The nine-day conference concluded with a summary by Jin Cheng.

    The conference first affirmed the achievements of propaganda and education work throughout the province. Since the establishment of the province in August, propaganda and education work in various regions has gradually moved towards unification in terms of principles and steps. The Party committees in most regions have further strengthened the leadership of propaganda and education work, generally attaching importance to strengthening on-the-job cadre education (mainly cadres at the county level and above), and some regions have begun to pay attention to establishing and rectifying Party branch education. Attention has been paid to publicizing various basic policies and the victorious situation to the broad masses. Some prefectural committees, municipal committees, county committees, and town committees have begun to establish various working systems, and some have adhered to them very well. However, on the whole, this progress is far from keeping up with the needs of the development of the new situation. The following are the main problems that still exist in propaganda and education work throughout the province: (1) The Party committees at all levels have not yet raised the ideological leadership of propaganda and education work to the level urgently required by today's construction tasks. Some prefectural and county committees have failed to seriously discuss and implement the instructions of higher authorities regarding propaganda and education work, showing a liberal attitude. In terms of organizational leadership, the "all-encompassing" leadership method is often adopted, and there is insufficient specific leadership from top to bottom. (2) The relationship between central work and departmental work. In the past, many cadres believed that there was a "contradiction" between central work and departmental work. On the one hand, many places continued to use the "all-encompassing" leadership method, weakening departmental work; on the other hand, some cadres had the idea and practice of conducting departmental work in isolation, resulting in a lack of organic coordination between central work and departmental work. (3) The current problems in the on-the-job cadre study are: first, theoretical study and policy practice cannot be well connected, so the publicity of policies is not profound, and the grasp of policies is not firm; second, cadre study in most regions is not good. The basic problem is that the leadership ignores it and lacks specific assistance, which often leads to certain deviations or even errors in the implementation of the Party's policies. The central problem in branch education is: the education of rural Party members still remains at the level of educating farmers, remaining "discussing things as they are", and failing to raise the ideological and policy level of Party members from specific problems. The publicity to the masses still lacks systematic and in-depth explanations of each of the Party's policies, so that the masses consciously accept them. (4) The problem of cultivating cadres and improving their professional level. The professional level of most propaganda and education cadres is very low, and they have a unclear understanding of the nature and tasks of propaganda and education work, especially the vague understanding that strengthening propaganda and education work is to strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership over Party members, cadres, and the masses. They do not understand that the task of propaganda and education work is to improve the political and ideological level of cadres, Party members, and the masses to ensure the implementation and execution of the Party's line and policies.

    In his conclusion, Jin Cheng, Minister of the Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Department, emphasized the issue of improving and strengthening the ideological and organizational leadership of propaganda and education work. He pointed out the solution of several problems: (1) Party committees at all levels must attach importance to propaganda and education work ideologically and put it on the agenda of the Party committee meetings, overcoming the mistaken view of some cadres (including leading cadres) that propaganda and education work is "abstract and not specific," and that "it doesn't show much whether it is done or not." Party committees at all levels should arrange propaganda and education work in a planned and demanding manner according to the needs of the overall work and each stage. For important propaganda and education work resolutions and instructions from the higher-level Party committees, they should formulate specific implementation plans based on the actual situation of their regions. The Party committee should regularly conduct organized inspections of propaganda and education work, and promptly correct phenomena that do not conform to the Party's line and policies, as well as formalism and coercive orders in the implementation of policies in propaganda and education work. (2) To establish the regular work of the propaganda department, it is first necessary to establish and strengthen the collective leadership and division of labor of Party committees at all levels. (3) Gradually change the "all-encompassing" leadership method. Today's work is more complex and the tasks are more arduous. The working method of "grabbing everything" and "single-handedly" can no longer cope with today's situation. This requires strengthening the work of various departments to promote various organizational forces, and completing the work in a planned and accurate manner. However, at the same time, we should prevent the tendency of conducting departmental work in isolation. Therefore, the Party committee should conduct thorough research in advance for the realization of a central task, and make an overall plan for the allocation of time, the organization of the forces of various departments, the unity of steps, and specific steps. (4) Vigorously cultivate propaganda and education cadres, improve the organization of propaganda departments of Party committees at all levels, and improve the professional level of on-the-job cadres. This is a basic condition for improving propaganda and education work. Party committees at all levels should strengthen assistance level by level, and improve the propaganda and education cadres at the county and district levels through specific assistance in their work. Propaganda and education cadres at all levels should strive to strengthen their professional studies. (5) The propaganda departments of the Party committees should establish and improve various working systems. In addition to the meeting system, the emphasis is on stipulating a strict system of requesting instructions and reporting. At the same time, we must conscientiously implement the inspection work, and go deep into the implementing areas to conduct on-the-spot inspections of the implementation. Overcome the phenomenon of reporting only good news and not bad news.

    Finally, the Provincial Party Committee arranged new tasks for propaganda and education work under the new situation: (1) Branch education: In the next six months, the rural branch education work requires gradually establishing and improving the organizational structure of branch education work in terms of organization; and establishing a regular system and leadership system for branch education. In terms of educational content, equal emphasis should be placed on the education of basic knowledge of the Party and Marxism-Leninism and the education of current work and current affairs policies, and the two should be closely combined. The guiding principle of town and township branch education should be to focus on the education of basic knowledge of the Party and Marxism-Leninism, supplemented by the education of current work and current affairs, to improve the class consciousness of Party members and establish a communist outlook on life. In larger cities with factories and mines branches, this guiding principle should first be implemented in the factory and mine branches. (2) On-the-job cadre education: The six-month study plan stipulates: Grade A studies the books Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism and "Left-Wing" Communism: an Infantile Disorder; Grade B studies An Outline of Social Science. Grade C and district cadres spend half of their time studying branch teaching materials and Party newspapers and periodicals, and illiterate and semi-literate people study culture. (3) Strengthen the communication reports and distribution work of newspapers. Communication reports should improve the quality of reports on the existing basis. Make the reports closely integrated with the leadership at all levels and the actual work. Through communication reports, implement inspection work, and carry out criticism and self-criticism inside and outside the Party, to achieve the purpose of vividly and comprehensively reflecting and guiding the province's production movement and various constructions. At the same time, educate the broad masses of correspondents to further implement the guiding principle of the whole Party running newspapers and everyone running newspapers. (4) Carry out mass recreational activities for the New Year and Spring Festival. (5) Conscientiously carry out winter school work.

    积极推动新的建设工作
    中共河北省委召开全省宣教会议
    决加强各级对宣教工作的思想领导与组织领导
    提高干部理论学习  加强农村支部教育
    树立部门经常工作  改变“一揽子”领导方法
    培养宣教干部  健全工作制度
    【本报讯】中共河北省委于去年十二月一日到九日召开了全省党的宣传工作会议。到各地、市、县、镇委宣传部长和省级各宣教部门的党员干部共二百八十九人。会议主要解决了党的宣传教育工作的思想和组织领导问题；并分别解决了支部教育、干部教育、领导工作等项具体工作问题。给全省在新形势下进一步开展宣教工作打下有利基础。
    会议开始，首由省委宣传部长金城传达了省委关于加强党对宣教工作领导及几个具体工作的草案，经过六天的小组讨论，中间并插入十五个有关工作经验的典型报告。之后，省委书记林铁作了关于如何切实深入检查工作，改进领导方法，树立部门工作等问题的报告。会议进行中，中共中央华北局宣传部长张磐石亲临指导，并作了新形势下宣教工作新任务的报告。会议进行九天，由金城作了结论。
    会议首先肯定了全省宣教工作的成绩。自八月建省之后，各地区的宣教工作从方针上步骤上逐步走向统一，大部地区的党委进一步加强了宣教工作的领导，一般重视了加强在职干部教育（主要是县级以上干部），部分地区开始注意树立和整顿党的支部教育，对广大群众注意了各种基本政策和胜利形势的宣传，有些地委、市委、县委、镇委宣传部开始树立各种工作制度，有的坚持得很好。但总的看来，这种进步还远赶不上新形势发展的需要。在全省宣教工作中还存在着以下几个主要问题：（一）各级党委对宣教工作在思想领导上还未提到为今天的建设任务所迫切要求的高度，有的地、县委对上级关于宣教工作的指示，还未能认真讨论和执行，表现了一种自由主义的态度；在组织领导上，经常采用“一揽子”的领导方法，从上到下的具体领导不够。（二）中心工作与部门工作的关系问题。过去很多干部认为中心工作和部门工作有“矛盾”。一方面很多地方沿用“一揽子”的领导方法，削弱了部门工作；另一方面，有些干部存在着孤立进行部门工作的想法和做法，致使中心工作和部门工作缺乏有机的配合。（三）在职干部学习中当前存在的问题，一是理论学习与政策实践还不能很好联系，因此宣传政策不深刻，掌握政策就不坚定；一是大部地区区干部学习不好；基本问题是领导上忽视，缺乏具体帮助，因而使党的政策在实施中往往发生某些偏差甚至错误。支部教育存在的中心问题是：对农村党员的教育依然停留在教育农民的水平，停留在“就事论事”上面，而不能从具体问题提高党员的思想与政策水平。对群众的宣传，还缺乏有系统的深入的解释党的每种政策，使群众自觉的接受。（四）培养干部与提高干部业务水平问题。多数宣教干部业务水平很低，对宣教工作的性质和任务认识不清，尤其对加强宣教工作就是加强党对党员、干部、群众政治思想领导认识更是模糊。不了解宣教工作的任务就在于提高干部党员和群众的政治思想水平，以保证党的路线和政策的贯彻和执行。
    省委宣传部金城部长在结论中，强调提出了改进与加强宣教工作的思想领导和组织领导问题。并指出解决几个问题：（一）各级党委对宣教工作必须从思想上重视并提到党委会的议事日程上来，克服某些干部（包括领导干部在内）认为宣教工作“抽象不具体”，“做不做显不出什么”的错误观点。各级党委应根据整个工作及各个阶段需要，有计划有要求的布置宣教工作，对上级党委有关重要的宣教工作决议和指示，应根据本地区的实际情况作出具体执行的计划。党委会对宣教工作应经常进行有组织的检查，及时纠正不合乎党的路线、政策及宣教工作中的形式主义和执行政策中的强迫命令现象。（二）树立宣传部门的经常工作，首先必须树立与加强各级党委的集体领导与部门分工。（三）逐渐改变“一揽子”的领导方法。今天的工作更加复杂，任务更加艰巨，工作上“一把抓”“单打一”已无法应付今天的情况，这就要以加强各个部门的工作推动各种组织力量，有计划而且准确的完成工作的方法。但同时应防止孤立进行部门工作的偏向。因此，党委对一个中心任务的实现，事先应有周密的研究，对时间的支配，各部门力量的组织，步调的统一及具体的步骤等，作出通盘计划。（四）大力培养宣教干部，健全各级党委宣传部的组织，提高在职干部业务水平，这是提高宣教工作的基本条件。各级党委应加强逐级帮助，从工作的具体帮助中，提高县区级的宣教干部。各级宣教干部，都应努力加强自己的业务学习。（五）党委宣传部门树立与健全各种工作制度，除会议制度外，强调规定严格的请示报告制度。同时必须认真贯彻检查工作，要深入到执行地区对执行情况做实地检查。克服报喜不报忧的现象。
    最后，省委布置了新形势下宣教工作的新任务：（一）支部教育：今后半年农村支部教育工作要求在组织上逐渐普遍建立与健全支部教育工作的组织机构；并树立支部教育的经常制度和领导制度。在教育内容上，党的与马列主义的基本知识教育及当前工作和时事政策教育并重，二者并互相密切结合。市镇支部教育方针应以党的和马列主义的基本知识教育为主，以当前工作和时事教育为辅，以提高党员的阶级觉悟，确立共产主义的人生观。较大城市有工厂、矿山支部的，首先应在工、矿支部中贯彻此一方针。（二）在职干部教育：半年学习计划规定：甲级学习帝国主义论，左派幼稚病两书；乙级学习社会科学概论。丙级及区干部学习支部教材及党报、党刊各占一半时间，文盲半文盲学习文化。（三）加强报纸的通讯报导及发行工作，通讯报导应在现有基础上，提高报导质量。使报导和各级领导及实际工作密切结合，经过通讯报道，贯彻检查工作，开展党内外的批评与自我批评，以达到生动的全面的反映指导全省的生产运动和各种建设的目的。同时教育广大通讯员，进一步贯彻全党办报、大家办报的方针。（四）开展年节与春节群众文娱活动。（五）认真开展冬学工作。
