    Telegraph Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Requesting Suspension of Year-End Bonuses
    [This newspaper's report] The Bengbu and Tanggu Telecom Bureau Unions recently telegraphed Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, requesting the suspension of year-end bonuses and double salaries. The original text is as follows: Bengbu Telecom Union's telegram to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou of the Central People's Government:

    Since the liberation of Bengbu, the political status of workers has improved, and their lives have been guaranteed. We are delighted to hear of the government's decision to provide double salaries at the end of the year, and we all believe that the government is still taking special care of our workers under the current circumstances of national financial difficulties. In addition to unanimously supporting the State Council's decision on double salaries at the end of the year, the workers of this bureau will donate all of this money to our brothers and sisters in disaster-stricken northern Anhui.

    Tanggu Telecom Bureau Union's telegram to Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou of the Central People's Government, and Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, forwarded to all staff and comrades:

    In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call to overcome difficulties and build arduously, we agree with the call of the Bengbu Telecom Union and the sixteen unions including Changsha. Our telecom bureau employees call on all staff and comrades in the North China region to enthusiastically respond to the request to suspend the year-end bonus for this year in order to reduce the government's financial difficulties. The staff in our North China region were liberated the earliest, have studied the longest, and understand the government the most deeply, and furthermore, the salaries in Beijing, Tianjin, and Tanggu are the highest, so we should respond with even greater enthusiasm and take the lead.

    蚌埠、塘沽电信工会
    致电毛主席、周总理请求停发年终奖金
    【本报讯】蚌埠、塘沽电信局工会，于日前致电毛主席、周总理暨邮电部朱部长，请求停发年终奖金及双薪。原文如下：蚌埠电信工会致毛主席、周总理电中央人民政府毛主席、政务院周总理：
    自蚌埠解放以来，工人政治地位提高，生活已得保障。欣闻政府年终双薪决定，咸思在目前国家财政困难情形下，政府对我工人还能特别照顾周到。本局工人除一致拥护政务院年关双薪决定外，并将此款全数献给皖北受灾兄弟姊妹们。
    塘沽电信局工会致毛主席、周总理电中央人民政府毛主席、周总理、邮电部朱部长转全体职工同志们：
    为了响应毛主席的克服困难、艰苦建设的号召，同意蚌埠电信工会和长沙等十六工会的号召。我们电信局职工们，号召华北区的全体职工同志们，热烈响应请求停发本年度的年终奖金，以减少政府财政上的困难。我们华北区的职工获得解放最早，学习最久，了解政府最深，而且京、津、塘薪资最高，更应予热情的响应，以为倡导。
