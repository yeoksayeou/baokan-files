    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The work of restoring and consolidating school education in Henan and Hubei provinces has achieved considerable success. There are now 145 universities and middle schools and more than 5,000 primary schools in Henan Province, with a total of more than 579,000 students. Hubei Province has restored one provincial education college, one medical college, and one agricultural college, as well as 136 public and private secondary schools in various places, with a total of 30,057 middle school students. Before liberation, school education in the two provinces suffered extremely serious destruction from the Kuomintang. In Henan, school youths were deeply influenced by the Kuomintang's reactionary deceptive propaganda, planting deep-rooted concepts of "orthodoxy." On the eve of liberation, most of the teachers and students were deceived and threatened by bandit troops and fled to the south of the Yangtze River or hid in rural areas. In October 1948, the vast area and larger cities of Henan were liberated. According to the principle of temporarily maintaining the status quo and gradually reforming, the People's Government took over 126 primary and secondary schools in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou. More than 1,000 primary and secondary schools were also restored in other liberated medium and small cities, but due to the lack of planned and step-by-step management and leadership, short-term confusion occurred. After the establishment of the Central Plains Provisional People's Government in April 1949, in response to the above situation, the Central Plains Regional Education Conference was held, which determined to strengthen consolidation and reform. First, a teacher training class was established at Central Plains University, and short-term teacher training classes and summer seminars were also held simultaneously in various places, reforming more than 20,000 primary and secondary school teachers. Political study was immediately launched in various schools, democratic systems were established, learning morale was stabilized, the blind "orthodox" concepts remaining in the students' minds were basically eliminated, labor concepts were strengthened, and a foundation of patriotism and internationalism was established. Schools and students who had moved south also returned to the province one after another. At the same time, all localities vigorously mobilized school-age children to enroll. After three months of consolidation, it gradually got on the right track after July. Since the Hubei Provincial Government took over the educational institutions of the Kuomintang reactionary government at all levels last June, it has vigorously reformed teachers during the summer vacation. From the province to the county, summer teacher seminars were generally held. More than 4,300 in-service middle and primary school teachers from only the four special districts of Wu (Chang), Yang (Hanyang), Xiaogan, Mianyang, and Jingzhou, and the four counties and cities of Yichang, Lishan, Xishui, and Huangmei participated in the study. At the end of August, the Hubei Provincial Department of Education convened a meeting of education section chiefs from various special offices, cities, and counties, which determined the policy of "actively restoring, initially consolidating, and initially reforming," and focused on towns while also taking into account rural areas, in order to train educational cadres for rural areas. Over the past four months, it has corrected the past deviation of "major reforms" without regard to objective conditions and subjective strength, enabling the restoration and consolidation work to proceed rapidly. In addition to public schools, most private primary and secondary schools have also been restored. Initial reforms have been carried out in the restored schools, abolishing reactionary guidance systems and reactionary courses such as military training, boy scouts, civics, and party doctrine. Teaching methods have been initially reformed, democratic and unified leadership organizations have been established, democratic management has been implemented, and a study movement has been launched.

    河南湖北两省各级学校迅速恢复
    已改造教师数万名
    【本报讯】河南、湖北两省学校教育的恢复、整顿工作已获相当成绩。河南全省已有大、中学校一百四十五所，小学五千余所，共有学生五十七万九千余人；湖北省已恢复省立教育学院、医学院、农学院各一所及各地公私立中等学校一百三十六所，中学学生共三万零五十七人。两省的学校教育，在解放前均受国民党极严重的摧残，河南的学校青年中，因受国民党的反动欺骗宣传，种下了很深的“正统”观念，在解放前夕，大部师生都在匪军欺骗威胁下迁逃至江南或隐蔽农村。一九四八年十月，河南广大地区及较大城市均告解放，人民政府根据暂时维持现状，逐步改造的方针，在开封、郑州接管了中小学一二六所，其他解放了的中、小城市，亦恢复了千余所中小学校，但因未能有计划有步骤的管理与领导，以致曾造成短时间的混乱现象。一九四九年四月，中原临时人民政府成立后，针对以上情况，召开了中原区教育会议，确定加强整顿改革，首先在中原大学创办师资训练班，各地亦同时举办短期教师训练班与暑期讲习会，先后改造中小学教师二万余名。各学校中随即展开了政治学习，建立了民主制度，安定了学习情绪，残存在学生思想中的盲目“正统”观念已基本清除，加强了劳动观点，建立了热爱祖国和国际主义的思想基础；南迁的学校与学生亦陆续回境。同时各地大力动员学龄儿童入学，经过三个月的整顿，至七月以后逐步走上正轨。湖北省自去年六月接管国民党反动政府各级教育机构后，暑假中曾大力进行改造师资工作，从省到县普遍举办了暑期教师讲习会。仅武（昌）阳（汉阳）、孝感、沔阳、荆州等四个专区及宜昌、礼山、浠水、黄梅四县市参加学习的在职中、小学教师即有四千三百多人。八月底，湖北省教育厅召开了各专署、市、县的教育科长会议，确定了“积极恢复、初步整顿、初步改革”的方针，并以城镇为重点兼顾农村，以为农村培养教育干部，四个月来，纠正了过去不顾客观条件和主观力量，“大事改革”的偏向。使恢复整顿工作得以迅速进行，除公立学校外，私立中、小学亦大部恢复；在已恢复的学校中，已进行了初步改革，取消了反动的训导制度及军训、童军、公民、党义等反动课程，初步改革了教学法，建立了民主和统一领导的组织，实行了民主管理，展开了学习运动。
