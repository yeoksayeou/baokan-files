    American Imperialism is Following the Road to Rome's Demise
    A Critique of Truman's Congressional Message
    Truman's Congressional message, including his domestic and foreign policies and budget, shamelessly calls itself "center-left," even earning the epithet of a "socialist state" policy from the most blatant mouthpiece of the American financial magnates, the Republican Party's fanatics. However, in the eyes of scientific socialism, it is a complete hoax, unable to deceive anyone with a critical perspective.
    Under capitalist rule, the mass movements of all enslaved, oppressed, and exploited people demanding liberation are sweeping the world like a storm. Truman is forced to acknowledge this fact, but he wants to use flowery words to deceive and entice the worldwide liberation movements that are rising like a storm. At the same time, this message blatantly declares a long-term and tenacious struggle against the liberation movements of oppressed people in the economic, political, and military spheres. He threatens that communism is challenging Truman's masters. But as long as the working people of the world do not lose their position and confidence as working people, they will see that Truman's Congressional message is a challenge to dominate the world.
    Truman, like a brazen peddler, shamelessly hawks his plans.
    Truman calls out to his customers:
    "All of humanity in the world," "the people of all countries," "hundreds of millions of people," "all people," "all nations," "free people all over the world," do you want life, freedom, happiness, and peace? I have it all! If you don't believe it, that's because "people everywhere" are "corrupted and betrayed by the false promises of communism." Look at my goods, look at my budget, this is "the action taken by this government in financial terms to develop the economy of this country and the world and to expand human freedom in this country and the world." Don't you believe it? "America's economic potential is a cornerstone that will enable America to inspire free people around the world and give them the faith they should have in their cause." Don't you believe it? "I believe that all people are born equal and that they equally enjoy the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that the role of government is to serve these purposes." Don't you believe it? "Our goal in the world is peace." "We must never allow oppression or tyranny." "We...will be able to extend the full benefits of the democratic way of life to the hundreds of millions of people who do not now enjoy such benefits, and to free humanity from the rule of dictatorship and tyranny." Don't you believe it? That's because you're "corrupted and betrayed by the false promises of communism."
    Let's examine the goods of this "center-left" peddler of American imperialism. Truman's twelve-point economic and social program and his budget can be summed up in one sentence: stimulate war enterprises. He refuses to say it honestly, only saying "stimulate enterprises" or "the cooperative efforts of government and private enterprises." However, what "enterprises" and "private enterprises" are these? They are "private enterprises" that manufacture war. One look at the budget shows that 71% of the total budget of over 42 billion US dollars is military spending. Isn't using about 30 billion in military spending to "stimulate enterprises" or "cooperate with private enterprises" just stimulating war enterprises, stimulating enterprises that manufacture war? Is this a budget for peace? A budget for human freedom? This is a budget for stimulating war, manufacturing war, a budget for war enterprises pursuing their own happiness and destroying human happiness. Can it still be denied?
    Can the plans of the American imperialist war criminals still be disguised with the flowery words of "center-left"? The promises of peace and freedom have gone bankrupt! They have become "false promises" of peace and freedom!
    Just look at how Truman, the American imperialist president, treats his own people. Today, the living conditions of the American people cannot be said to be anything but serious. 14 million people are either fully or partially unemployed. More than 20 million agricultural people are in a state of being neither fully fed nor starving to death. The average debt per person is about 9,000 US dollars. Today, the tax burden on the American people is already close to 50 billion US dollars. In addition, they have to bear, and ultimately repay, a huge national debt totaling nearly 265 billion US dollars, and it is increasing rather than decreasing. Paying the debt interest alone requires bearing 5.625 billion US dollars each year. Having borne such a heavy burden of financial expenditure solely for American imperialism, what do the American people get in Truman's budget? Education spending is only 1%, health spending is only 1%, and unemployment relief is only 243 million US dollars, or about 0.5%. As for the much-touted "Truman Civil Rights Program," how much does it get? Pitiful and laughable, it only has 1 million US dollars in the budget! In short, the portion of the total expenditure budget allocated to "social needs" is only 5.1%. Moreover, some of these, such as the "Truman Civil Rights Program," are subject to being opposed by the "friendly party" at any time. Experience has proven that the "Truman Civil Rights Program" is by no means a point he is determined to fight for. He has always adopted a defeatist approach to this "Civil Rights Program" named after himself. From this, one can imagine how diligently the American imperialist president Truman cooperates with American war entrepreneurs, and how stingy and mean he is to the American people!
    An American imperialist president who is so stingy to his own people, would he be so generous to the people of other countries? Just take a look at Truman's five programs or plans for foreign policy. Which one of those programs or plans is not a program or plan to seek huge profits for the American financial oligarchs, the billionaires, and the American war enterprises? Which one does not include suppressing the people's liberation movements, enslaving and exploiting the people of various countries and the people of the colonies, and buying off and corrupting a few backward elements among them to paralyze more people, and seizing the domestic markets of other countries? Wouldn't these plans or programs, which devour the blood and sweat of the broad masses of the people, themselves generate the stubborn resistance of the broad masses of the people? As long as they have begun to be implemented, resistance will inevitably arise everywhere, simply because they are all human beings. Regarding human resistance as "corrupted and betrayed by the false promises of communism" is not only an insult to communism and to humanity, but also incoherent absurdity. As the speech of the president of a country, it simply insults the people of his own country at the same time.
    However, Truman doesn't care about so much. What does the American imperialist president most urgently need now? Truman said very clearly in his message: he needs "a large amount of expenditure." The word "expenditure" is still not honest enough. In fact, what is needed is a large amount of military expenditure, military expenditure accounting for three-quarters of the total budget. Without this "large amount of expenditure," American imperialism cannot survive. As long as this "large amount of expenditure" is obtained through deception, the world policy of the American imperialist vampire can continue its pragmatism. That is:
    1.  Continue to fully arm the world policy of American imperialism from head to toe using all sophistry, names, and deceptions. In Truman's own words, that is: "As long as the world remains in an uncertain state and as long as our own security and the security of the free world require it, we will maintain a strong and impartial (i.e., exclusively for the use of American imperialism) defense organization," that is, an offensive and aggressive organization in the name of defense.
    2.  Cunningly pretending not to interfere in internal affairs, use economic and military power to strongly support the bourgeois regimes of other countries. In Truman's own words, that is: "Other countries expect us to wisely use our economic and military power, and expect us to vigorously support the ideals of representative government and a free society. We will not disappoint them."
    3.  Monopolize the secrets of nature in an institution ruled by American imperialism, as a trump card to dominate the world. In Truman's own words, that is: "Humanity has reached a turning point. Humanity has revealed the secrets of nature and mastered new power. If this power is used wisely, it will reach the highest peak of civilization. If this power is used foolishly, this power may destroy it. Humanity must create a moral and legal institution for the world to ensure that its new power is used for good and not for bad. The American people will play a leading role in creating results."
    4.  Control the United Nations and the force that the United Nations may obtain. In Truman's words, that is: "We will continue to wholeheartedly support the United Nations. The United Nations will control weapons of mass slaughter and have troops to maintain international security."
    5.  Suppress and soften the liberation struggles of the people of various countries. On the one hand, use the bribery policy of economic assistance to force the wage slaves who are enslaved, oppressed, and exploited in various countries to obey the "liberalism," "representative government," and "democratic way of life" that American imperialism believes it can control at will. On the other hand, suppress the liberation movements of the people of various countries striving for peace, democracy, and socialism as a challenge to communism, in order to unscrupulously plunder and exploit the entire globe. In Truman's words, that is: "We will continue to work for the world economic recovery, because world prosperity is the only reliable foundation for lasting peace. We must continue to support the European Recovery Program as a current method to achieve the aforementioned goals." "The expanding world economy needs to improve living standards and develop resources in areas where human poverty and disaster are currently prevalent." "Provide increasing technical assistance and investment to backward areas," "A large amount of capital needs to flow from industrialized countries, especially the United States, to backward areas for production." "Without this improvement (increasingly unscrupulous plunder), the revival of Europe and the future of our own economy will be unreliable." "We are facing a crisis" (that is, the challenge of communism). "This challenge to us is not just a military challenge; it is a challenge to our democracy... it is a challenge to the efficiency (exploitation rate) and stability of our economic system... I believe that our country will be able to successfully meet this challenge at this critical juncture in world history."
    In these words of Truman's, there is an unstated meaning, that is: without suppressing the liberation struggles of the people everywhere, it is impossible to unscrupulously plunder backward areas, and it is also impossible to unscrupulously plunder Europe. Without plundering Europe, it is impossible to plunder the whole world. Then, "the future of our own economy will be unreliable." This last sentence is entirely Truman's own words, and these words are the entire secret of his message.
    Here, we are reminded of the boast Truman once made: "America's economic potential is a cornerstone that will enable America to inspire free people all over the world and give them the faith they should have in their cause." And he continued to boast: "The American economy will not stagnate." "But—he said—as if the devil made him think of it and say it: in order to avoid the crisis and ensure that everyone gets a job, the American economy must continue to progress," must continue to launch a comprehensive offensive against the world in order to "ensure the prosperity of the American nation." What if it is impossible to plunder the whole world? "The future of our (American imperialism) own economy will be unreliable." So what to do?
    71% of the total budget of over 42 billion is for military expenditure! 5.1% is for "social needs" appropriations! But what about the plight of most American families who cannot make ends meet? Talk about it in fifty years! Truman wrote a long-term check for fifty years, saying that by 2000, the United States would have a production volume of one trillion US dollars. At that time, the average income of American families could reach 12,000 US dollars. But today, the American people must abide by two conditions, namely: 1. In the next fifty years, the rate of increase in national productivity will continue to maintain the level achieved since 1900; 2. "Follow the correct policies," which are: (1) The American people must continue to work like wage slaves as they did in the past, working desperately to produce a production volume of one trillion US dollars for the billionaires; (2) Obey the policies of imperialism and abandon the road to revolution.
    Things are clearer. Truman himself is running in circles with the devil: without plundering the working people of the world, the American imperialist economy has no future. To plunder the whole world, it is also necessary to plunder the American working people. The American working people have been plundered, therefore, American imperialism has the capital and means to plunder the whole world, but having plundered the whole world, the American working people are still wage slaves!
    However, the American imperialist president is still dreaming! He and American imperialism are following the road to Rome's demise. Rome's demise was due to huge financial expenditures! In order to plunder a world empire, all financial resources must be used to support a world empire. When income cannot meet expenditure, it cannot be supported and it perishes along with the world empire. Today, American imperialism is also following this path. In order to support American imperialism's world policy, it forces American wage slaves to bear annual expenditures of 50 billion US dollars and a total national debt of 265 billion US dollars. This is about to make the American people unable to support it and unable to live. If the people cannot live, the ruling class will also not be able to live! The fate of American imperialism's demise has already been determined, determined in the budget table of its world policy, determined in the astronomical figures of the huge national debt.
    American imperialism is bound to perish, and it will not be long. This nouveau riche imperialism cannot survive for long. Although it also understands that "the rapid progress of events will make the next fifty years decisive in the history of mankind on this planet," and therefore it has to make a barbaric final struggle like all the fascist imperialisms that have perished in the past, but this final struggle itself will create even greater national debt and financial expenditure. Moreover, the most fatal point of American imperialism's world policy is to be an enemy of all mankind: to be an enemy of the liberation movement of mankind. Therefore, American imperialism's world policy only means that American imperialism will be eliminated by the whole world and all mankind.
    However, the demise of American imperialism is by no means the demise of the American people, but rather the liberation of the American people. This is different from the situation in Roman times. At that time, all the slaves of Rome could at most be transformed into the predecessors of serfs. Today, the American people, all wage slaves, will, together with the people of various countries, be freed from the fate of wage slaves.

    美帝国主义正走着罗马灭亡之道
    评杜鲁门国会咨文
    杜鲁门的国会咨文包括他的内外政策和预算在内，恬然自称为“中间偏左”，还落得美国大财阀的最露骨的代言人共和党的疯狂分子把它称为“社会主义国家”的政策，但在科学的社会主义的眼光中完全是一种卖悄，欺骗不了一切有批判眼光的人们。
    在资本统治下面一切被奴役、被压迫、被剥削的人们要求解放的群众运动，正风起云涌地席卷着全世界，杜鲁门不得不承认这个事实，但他想用花言巧语来欺骗诱惑全世界风起云涌的解放运动，同时就在这个咨文中露骨地表明要与被压迫人民的解放运动在经济、政治、军事上作长期顽强的斗争。他威胁地说：共产主义向杜鲁门的主子们挑战。但全世界劳动人民只要不丧失劳动人民的立场与信心，就会看出杜鲁门的国会咨文是威胁世界独霸世界的挑战书。
    杜鲁门像老面皮的叫贩一样，大言不惭地拍卖自己的方案。
    杜鲁门向顾客们叫卖道：
    “全世界人类”、“各国人民”、“亿万人民”、“所有的人们”、“所有的民族”、“全世界自由人”，你们要生活、自由、幸福、和平吗？这一切我都有！假如你们不相信，那因为你们“各地人民”“被共产主义的假诺言所败坏与背弃”。你们看我的货色吧，你们看我的预算吧，这是“本政府在财政上为发展本国及全世界经济并扩展本国及全世界人类自由而采取的行动”。你们不相信吗？我“美国的经济潜力是一个基石，它将使美国得能鼓舞全世界自由人，使他们怀有对他们事业应有的信念”。你们不相信吗？我“相信：所有的人们生来是平等的，他们平等地享有生活、自由、追求幸福的权利而且政府的职责即在于服务这些目的”。你们不相信吗？“我们在世界上的目标是和平”。“我们决不能容许压迫或虐政”。“我们……将能把民主生活方式的充分利益，扩展到现在未享有此种利益的亿万人民，并使人类免受独裁与专制的统治”。你们不相信吗？那因为你们“被共产主义的假诺言所败坏与背弃”。
    检查一下这个美帝国主义“中间偏左”叫贩的货色吧。杜鲁门的十二点经济和社会方案以及他的预算案，用一句话来总括，就是：刺戟战争企业。他不肯老实说，他只说：“刺戟企业”或者“政府与私人企业相配合的努力”。然而，这“企业”、这“私人企业”是什么“私人企业”呢？是制造战争的“私人企业”。一看预算表就知道总预算四百二十多亿美元，有百分之七十一是军事费用，拿三百亿左右的军事费用来“刺戟企业”或“与私人企业相配合的努力”还不是刺戟战争企业、刺戟制造战争的企业吗？这是和平的预算吗？人类自由的预算吗？这是刺戟战争、制造战争的预算，这是战争企业追求自己的幸福，毁灭人类幸福的预算，难道还可以抵赖吗？
    美帝国主义的战争罪犯的计划还能用“中间偏左”的花言巧语来粉饰吗？和平诺言自由诺言破产了！变成和平自由的“假诺言”了！
    单看杜鲁门这位美帝国主义总统如何对待他本国人民吧。今天美国人民的生活状况不能说不严重，一千四百万人的全失业与部分失业，二千多万农业人口在吃不饱饿不死的境地中，每人的平均负债约在九千元之数。今天美国人民捐税负担已经快到五百亿元，此外还要负担而且总要偿还的一大笔国债总额将近二千六百五十亿元而且有增无减，单单付债息都要每年负担五十六亿二千五百万元。替美帝国主义负担了这么重的单单财政支出，但在杜鲁门预算表中美国人民得到什么呢？教育经费只有百分之一，卫生用费只有百分之一，失业救济只有二亿四千三百万元即百分之零点五左右。至于大事吹嘘的“杜鲁门民权纲领”能分到多少呢？可怜又可笑，就在预算中也只有一百万元！总之全部支出预算分到“社会需要”上来的部分仅仅是百分之五点一。而且其中有些如“杜鲁门民权纲领”还随时让“友党”反对掉。经验证明：“杜鲁门民权纲领”决不是他必争之点，他向来对这冠以自己的大名的“民权纲领”取失败主义的方针。这就可想而知，美帝国主义总统杜鲁门对美国战争企业家们何等努力配合而对美国人民则又何等吝啬刻薄！
    对本国人民这样刻薄吝啬的美帝国主义总统，难道对外国人民就会那样慷慨乐助吗？就拿杜鲁门对外政策的五个方案或计划来看吧，那一个方案或计划不是替美国金融寡头亿万富豪们、替美国战争企业谋大利的方案或计划呢？那一个不包含镇压人民解放运动、奴役与剥削各国人民与殖民地人民并收买与腐化其中少数落后分子以麻痹较多人民、霸占他国国内市场等等活动之一部或全部呢？这些吞噬广大人民膏血的计划或方案本身，难道不会产生广大人民的顽强抵抗吗？只要已经开始实施，到处都必然产生人的抵抗，仅仅因为他们都是人。把人的抵抗看作“被共产主义的假诺言所败坏与背弃”，不仅是对共产主义并对人类的侮蔑，而且是语无伦次的荒谬，作为一国总统的说话简直同时也侮辱了他本国的人民。
    然而杜鲁门顾不得这么多了。目前美帝国主义总统最急迫需要什么呢？杜鲁门在咨文中很明白地说：需要“大笔费用”。费用二字还不老实，其实就是需要大笔军事费用，占总预算四分之三的军事费用，没有这“大笔费用”，美帝国主义就活不成，只要把这“大笔费用”骗到手，美帝国主义吸血鬼的世界政策就可以继续进行它的实际主义。那就是：
    一、利用一切诡辩、名义与骗术继续把美帝国主义的世界政策从头发到脚爪全部武装起来。用杜鲁门自己的话来讲，那就是：“当世界仍陷于不确定状态而且只要我们自己的安全和自由世界的安全需要时，我们决保持强大和无所偏倚（即专为美帝国主义所用）的防御组织”，即以防御为名的进攻与侵略组织。
    二、狡猾地装出不干涉内政的样子，运用经济与军事力量去强力地支持其他各国资产阶级政权，用杜鲁门自己的话来讲，就是：“其他各国期望我们明智地运用我们的经济和军事力量，并期望我们有力地支持代议制政府的理想和自由社会，我们不会使他们失望。”
    三、在美帝国主义统治的一个机构中独霸大自然的秘密，作为一张王牌来独霸世界，用杜鲁门自己的话来讲，就是：“人类已达到一个转折点，人类已揭露了大自然的秘密并掌握了新的力量。倘若对这种力量予以明智的运用，他将能达到文明的最高峰。倘若他对这种力量予以愚蠢的运用，这种力量或将摧毁他。人类必须为世界创立一种道德与法律的机构，以保证他的新力量用在好的方面而不用在坏的方面。在创造结果上美国人民将起领导的作用。”
    四、把持联合国并把持联合国可能争取到的武力，用杜鲁门的话来讲，就是：“我们将继续全心全意地支持联合国。联合国将控制大规模屠杀的武器并拥有部队维持国际治安。”
    五、镇压与软化各国人民解放斗争，一方面用经济援助的收买政策把美帝国主义认为可以随意控制的“自由主义”、“代议制政府”与“民主生活方式”去强迫各国被奴役、被压迫、被剥削的工钱奴隶们服从；另一方面把各国人民争取和平民主与社会主义的解放运动作为共产主义的挑战来镇压，以便肆无忌惮地搜括与剥削全地球。用杜鲁门的话来讲，就是：“我们将继续努力于世界经济复兴，因为世界繁荣是永久和平的唯一可靠基础。我们必须继续支持欧洲复兴方案作为当前的方法来达到前述目的。”“扩展中的世界经济，需要在人类贫穷与灾害目前流行的地区中改进生活标准与开发资源”。“对落后地区提供有增无已的技术援助和投资”、“需要有大量资本由工业国家尤其是美国方面流往落后地区供生产之用”。“如没有这种改进（有增无已的搜括），欧洲的复兴与我们自身经济的前途将是不可靠的。”“我们面临一种危机”（就是共产主义的挑战），“对我们的这个挑战，不止是一个军事挑战；它对我们的民主……乃是一个挑战；它对我们的经济制度的效率（剥削率）和稳定，是一个挑战……。我相信：我们国家在世界历史中这个紧要关头将能胜利地应付这个挑战。”
    在杜鲁门的这些话里面，有一个秘而不宣的意思，就是：不镇压各地人民解放斗争便不能有增无已地搜括落后地区，也不能有增无已地搜括欧洲，不能搜括欧洲也就不能搜括全世界，那末，“我们自身经济的前途将是不可靠的”。最后这句话，完全是杜鲁门自己的话，这话就是他的咨文的全部秘密。
    到这里，我们想起杜鲁门曾吹过牛皮：“美国的经济潜力是一个基石，它将使美国得能鼓舞全世界自由人，使他们怀有对于他们事业应有的信念”。并且还继续吹嘘道：“美国的经济不会停滞不前”。“但—他说—好像魔鬼使他不得不想到而且说出：为了避免危机并保证一切人获得工作，美国的经济必须不断地进展”，必须不断地向世界全面进攻，以“保证美国国家的繁荣”，如果不能搜括全世界怎么办？“我们（美帝国主义）自身经济的前途将是不可靠的”。因此怎么办？
    四百二十多亿总预算百分之七十一作军事费用！百分之五点一作“社会需要”的拨款！但美国大多数家庭入不敷出的困苦怎么办呢？隔五十年再讲！杜鲁门开了一张五十年的长期支票说到了二○○○年美国就会有一万亿的生产量，那时，美国家庭平均收入可达一万二千元，但必须今天美国人民遵守两个条件，就是：一、在以后五十年内，国家生产力的增加速度继续维持自一九○○年以来所达到的水平；二、“遵循正确的政策”，这就是：（一）要美国人民像过去一样做工钱奴隶，拼命劳动，替亿万富豪们生产一万亿元的生产量；（二）服从帝国主义的政策，放弃革命的道路。
    事情较清楚了。杜鲁门自己在跟着魔鬼打圈子：不搜括全世界劳动人民，美帝国主义经济没有前途，要搜括全世界，也必须搜括美国劳动人民。美国劳动人民被搜括了，因之，美帝国主义就有资本和手段去搜括全世界，但搜括了全世界，美国劳动人民还是工钱奴隶！
    然而，美帝国主义总统还在做梦！他和美帝国主义一起走着罗马灭亡的道路。罗马的灭亡，灭亡在庞大的财政支出上！为了搜括一个世界帝国必须用尽一切财力去支撑一个世界帝国，到了入不敷出的时候，就支撑不住而跟着世界帝国一起灭亡了。今天美帝国主义也走着这条道路。为了支撑美帝国主义的世界政策，强迫美国工钱奴隶负担每年五百亿美元的支出和总共二千六百五十亿美元的国债，这就快使美国人民支持不下去，活不下去了，人民活不下去，统治阶级也会活不下去！美帝国主义灭亡的命运已经注定了，注定在它的世界政策的预算表中，注定在巨大国债的天文数字中。
    美帝国主义一定灭亡，而且为时不会很久，这个暴发户帝国主义不可能生存很久，尽管它也懂得“事态的迅速进展，将使未来五十年在这个行星上的人类历史中具有决定性的意义”，并且因而它不得不像过去一切灭亡了的法西斯帝国主义一样作野蛮的最后挣扎，但就是这最后挣扎本身，将造成更巨大的国债与财政支出。而且美帝国主义的世界政策的最致命的一点，就是与全人类为敌：与人类的解放运动为敌。所以美帝国主义的世界政策，只意味着美帝国主义将被全世界全人类所消灭。
    然而美帝国主义的灭亡，决不是美国人民的灭亡，反而是美国人民的解放。这一点和罗马时代情形不同。当时罗马的一切奴隶至多只能转成农奴前身，今天美国人民，一切工钱奴隶将和各国人民一起，解脱工钱奴隶的命运。
