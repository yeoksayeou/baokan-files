    North China Egg Company, Yuci Branch
    Plans to Purchase Eggs
    Relying on Cooperatives to Complete This Year's Purchasing Task

    [This Newspaper's Report] The Yuci Branch of the North China Egg Company is purchasing large quantities of eggs, stimulating farmers' chicken production. The company was established in mid-October last year, and in the past two months or so, it has made considerable achievements in purchasing: a total of 169,895 fresh eggs were purchased. During the purchasing process, surveys of egg production were also conducted. In terms of purchasing methods, special emphasis was placed on combining with village cooperatives. For example, the Xin County group in the company's four groups last year established contact with eight village cooperatives, which purchased 30,610 fresh eggs on behalf of the company. The Linfen group established purchasing relationships with eight village cooperatives, and the cooperatives purchased 27,535 fresh eggs on their behalf. The Lishi group also established purchasing relationships with 22 cooperatives, and six cooperatives alone collected 4,590 eggs. From these concrete efforts, the company's comrades have initially realized the importance of relying on cooperatives. Many village cooperative cadres have also initially experienced that, after establishing contact with the egg company, egg sales are much easier than before, and a fair price can be obtained. This method is highly supported by the members.
    The main shortcomings identified are: 1. Insufficient understanding of the situation, which led to significant blindness in planning. For example, the initial plan was to purchase a total of 2.5 million fresh eggs, but only 169,895 eggs were purchased, accounting for only 6.6% of the original plan. The main reason for this is that the plan's requirements were too high, and the use of resources was inappropriate. 2. The connection with cooperatives is not yet widespread, and the established relationships are not normal enough. Some company cadres still believe that cooperatives are not as good as private merchants and peddlers (the power of legitimate private merchants and peddlers should also be used), and therefore did not actively and proactively contact cooperatives. On the other hand, some village cooperatives still do not fully recognize that contacting the company is one of the best ways for cooperatives to sell products for their members, and still treat the company with the attitude of dealing with private merchants, such as not keeping their word, using advance payments for other business, and not paying attention to the quality of eggs collected. This has caused some losses to our work, and we must strive to improve it in the future. 3. Cadres are not yet keeping up with the needs of the work in terms of business and technical skills.
    Based on the current situation, the company has formulated its purchasing plan for this year. The whole year's purchase of 15 million fresh eggs will be concentrated to Yangquan Egg Factory production. The main purchasing method is to rely on cooperatives, while not neglecting the organization of private merchants and peddlers, and focused self-purchasing.
    In relying on cooperatives, generally do not directly contact village cooperatives, but rather sign contracts with special district supply and marketing cooperatives and county federations of cooperatives, and contact village cooperatives through them. Attention should be paid to the correct control of prices during purchasing. In order to better complete the task, business and technical training should be conducted among the cadres.

### 华北蛋品公司榆次分公司  有计划收购鸡蛋  依靠合作社完成今年收购任务

    有计划收购鸡蛋
    依靠合作社完成今年收购任务
    【本报讯】华北蛋品公司榆次分公司，大量收购鸡蛋，刺激了农民养鸡生产。该公司于去年十月中旬成立，两个多月来，在收购工作上曾做出了不少成绩：共计收鲜蛋十六万九千八百九十五个。在收购中同时进行了鸡蛋生产情况的调查。在收购方式上，特别着重与村合作社相结合，如该公司去年所分四个组中的忻县组，与八个村社取得了联系，给公司代购了鲜蛋三万零六千一百个；临汾组与八个村社建立了代购关系，合作社便代购了鲜蛋二万七千五百三十五个；离石组也与廿二个合作社建立了代购关系，仅六个合作社即代收了蛋四千五百九十个。从这些具体工作中，公司的同志们初步认识到依靠合作社的重要性；不少的村合作社干部，也初步体验到与蛋品公司取得联系后，鸡蛋的推销比以前容易得多了，而且可以得到公道的价钱，这种方法受到社员十分拥护。
    检查缺点，主要是：一、情况了解不够，因而定计划就产生了很大的盲目性。比如开始计划共收购鲜蛋二百五十万个，结果只收了十六万九千八百九十五个，仅占原计划的百分之六点六。这里主要原因是计划要求太高，力量运用不适当。二、与合作社的联系还不普遍，已经联系的关系也不够正常。公司有些干部还认为合作社不如私商小贩（对正当的私商小贩也要运用他们的力量），因而没有主动的积极的去与合作社联系。另一方面，也有些村社，对于与公司联系是合作社给社员推销产品的最好方式之一，认识的还不够，还是以对待私商的态度来对待公司，如不讲信用，拿上款做了其他买卖，收蛋不讲好坏等。这使我们的工作受了一些损失，今后必须努力改善。三、干部在业务技术上还赶不上工作需要。
    根据现有情况，公司定出了今年的收购计划。全年要收鲜蛋一千五百万个，都集中到阳泉蛋厂生产。收购方式主要是依靠合作社，同时也不忽视组织私商小贩，及有重点的自行收购。
    在依靠合作社上，一般的不直接与村社联系，而是要与专区供销社、县联社订立合同，通过他们与村社联系。收购中要注意价格的正确掌握。为了更好的完成任务，在干部中要进行业务与技术的学习。
