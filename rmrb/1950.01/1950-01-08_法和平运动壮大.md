The slogan "Don't fight against the Soviet people" wins over the broad masses; the movement to ban atomic weapons has begun; a united front against American imperialism's arming of West Germany is being organized.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 7th. TASS, Moscow, January 6th: *Pravda* published a dispatch from its Paris correspondent, Zhukov, reporting on the French working class's struggle for peace, stating: The French peace movement is growing stronger. The peace vote of seven million people last year vividly demonstrates the movement's mass character, and the heart of the movement is the French working class led by the French Communist Party. Peace fighters launched a movement against the Vietnam War, bringing youth, women, trade unions, and all democratic organizations into this movement. The French Communist Party announced the slogan "Don't fight against the Soviet people," winning over the broad masses. The Communist Party explained to the people the conspiracy of American imperialism to establish world hegemony, exposed the North Atlantic Alliance as a threat to peace, and warned the people not to underestimate the danger of war. Peace fighters are now preparing a two-week movement to ban atomic weapons and immediately reduce armaments. From January 7th to 21st, mass demonstrations will be held throughout France. Films, newspapers, books, and radio programs prepared by American propaganda organs for a new war will be boycotted. A broad united front against the rearmament of West Germany, which American imperialists are currently preparing, is being organized. Workers in war factories have received leaflets asking them to stop war production and convert factories to peaceful production.

Now, the French working people are more united than ever, and the working class enjoys the support of a broad population. This is the guarantee of the success of the French peace movement.

    法和平运动壮大
    “不对苏联人民作战”的口号赢得广大群众，要求禁止原子武器的运动已经开始，反对美帝武装西德的统一阵线正在组织。
    【新华社北京七日电】塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：真理报刊载该报驻巴黎记者朱可夫的通讯，报道法国工人阶级的和平斗争称：法国和平运动日益壮大，去年七百万人的和平投票，生动地证明了运动的群众性，而运动的心脏是法国共产党领导的法国工人阶级。和平战士发动反对越南战争的运动，使青年、妇女、工会等所有的民主组织加入到这个运动中来。法国共产党宣布“不对苏联人民作战”的口号，争取了广大的群众。共产党向人民解释美帝国主义建立世界霸权的阴谋，揭露北大西洋联盟是和平的威胁，并警惕人民不要低估战争的危险。和平战士们现在正筹备禁止原子武器和立即裁减军备的两周运动。自一月七日至二十一日间，将在全法各地举行群众示威。美国宣传机关准备新战争的电影、报纸、书籍和广播节目将被抵制。反对美国帝国主义者目前所准备的重新武装西德的广泛统一阵线正在组织中。战争工厂的工人们收到传单，要求他们停止战争生产，并把工厂转入和平生产上去。
    现在，法国劳动人民比任何时候都更团结，工人阶级享有广泛的人民的支持。这就是法国和平运动获得成功的保证。
