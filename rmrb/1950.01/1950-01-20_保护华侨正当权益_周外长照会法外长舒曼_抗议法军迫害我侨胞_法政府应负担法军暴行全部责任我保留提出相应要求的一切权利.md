Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 19th. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China sent a note to French Foreign Minister Schuman regarding the atrocities committed by French troops against Chinese nationals in French-occupied areas of Vietnam. The full text of the note is as follows:

To His Excellency Minister Schuman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the French Republic:

According to reports from overseas Chinese residing in Vietnam: "On the night of November 19, 1949, more than a hundred French armed forces surrounded the Qingling and Liugang farms in Yong'an Province. Both farms are entirely inhabited by overseas Chinese—a population of over 160—who only seek to make a living and stay neutral towards the French-Vietnamese war, not participating in local political activities; but they were completely surrounded. At dawn, French soldiers entered the houses and tied up all the men, young and old, with ropes, dragged them to the threshing ground, forced them to form a circle, and beat them while forcing them to walk around the circle. Those who walked fast were beaten, and those who walked slowly were also beaten. The remaining French soldiers stood by, jeering and making fun. This lasted for thirty minutes, and more than half of the men were injured. Li Hai, the chairman of the overseas Chinese council, who was over sixty years old, was beaten until his whole body was swollen and in pain. The French soldiers gathered all the women in one place and raped them in turn. Huang Ziai's wife, who was eight months pregnant, miscarried and died tragically because she was chased while trying to escape. After satisfying their bestial desires, the French soldiers forced the overseas Chinese to kill chickens, ducks, and pigs to cook for them. After the meal, the French soldiers rummaged through chests and cabinets, looting all the property and valuable clothes. Li Hai alone had six kilograms of gold stolen from him. At that time, some overseas Chinese showed their citizenship certificates to the French soldiers, but the French soldiers tore them up. When the French soldiers withdrew in the afternoon, they looted all the chickens, ducks, pigs, and cattle, and burned or destroyed all the granaries, furniture, and dishes, leaving all the overseas Chinese in dire straits."

It should be pointed out that such atrocities committed by French soldiers against overseas Chinese in Vietnam are by no means isolated. (For example, recently in Dongrong Village, Guang'an Province, all the houses, furniture, and grains of the entire village of overseas Chinese were burned by French soldiers, and all the livestock were looted. Li, a overseas Chinese in Dongjiao Village, Hongji Special Zone, and his three sons were brutally killed by French soldiers, etc. The magnitude of all the large and small atrocities cannot be statistically calculated now.)

Therefore, I would like to solemnly remind you that protecting the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese abroad is an unshakable policy of our government. The above-mentioned atrocities committed by the French armed forces against our overseas Chinese in Vietnam are intolerable to the Chinese people, and the French government should bear all responsibility for them. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China reserves all rights to make corresponding demands regarding the above and other similar incidents.

    【新华社北京十九日电】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长，为法军在越南法国占领区对我国侨胞暴行事，向法国外交部长舒曼致送照会一件。照会全文如下：
    法兰西共和国外交部舒曼部长阁下：
    据居留越南的华侨报告：“一九四九年十一月十九日深夜，法国武装部队百余人包围永安省青铃与流冈两农场，该两农场全部为华侨居住——人口一百六十余——只为谋生活温饱，绝不参与当地政治的活动，对法越战争向守中立；但竟全部被包围。清晨，法兵即行入室，对男性不分老幼一律用绳绑住，拉往晒谷场强迫围成圆圈，一面打着，一面迫着绕圈行走，走的快的被打，走的慢的也被打，其余法兵却在旁调笑取乐，历时达三十分钟，半数以上男人被打伤，而六十多岁的华侨理事会理事长李海被打得浑身肿痛。法兵对所有女人，集中于一地，施行轮奸。黄自霭的妻子怀了八个月的孕，因走避被追逐而至小产惨死。兽性满足后，又迫令华侨杀鸡、鸭、猪煮饭供应法兵。饭后法兵即倒箱翻箧，将所有财物及值钱衣服全部掠去，单是李海一人就被劫去黄金六公斤。当时有侨胞将国籍证交与法兵看，而法兵竟把它撕去。到了下午法兵撤退时将鸡、鸭、猪、牛全部掳去，谷仓及家具碗碟全部焚毁或捣毁，使全部侨胞生活陷于绝境”。
    应该指出，法兵对于越南华侨的这样的暴行绝不是孤立的。（如最近在广安省洞荣村全村华侨房屋家具谷物全部被法兵焚烧，家畜被掠一空。鸿基特区洞角村华侨李某父子三人惨遭法兵杀戮等等，大大小小暴行现在还没法统计。）
    为此我特郑重地提醒你，保护国外华侨的正当权益乃我政府不可动摇的政策。上述法国武装部队对我越南华侨的暴行，是我们中国人民所不能忍受的，其全部责任应由法国政府负担。我中华人民共和国中央人民政府保留对上述及其他类似事件提出相应要求的一切权利。
