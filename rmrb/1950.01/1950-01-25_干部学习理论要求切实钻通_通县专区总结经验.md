    Cadre Study of Theory Requires Thorough Understanding
    Tongxian Special District Summarizes Experience
    Guide Cadres to Study In-depth, Not Just Look at Progress for Results
    Prevent Subjective Speculation, Advocate Scientific Analysis
    [This newspaper's Hebei News] The Propaganda Section Chief of the Tongxian District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Tian Yafu, reported on Tongxian Special District's experience in organizing cadres to study theory, stating: Leaders cannot be satisfied with simply assigning, supervising, and demanding written results, nor can they simply use the completion of a few chapters and sections as a standard for evaluating performance. Instead, they must adopt the standard of judging performance based on the effectiveness of learning. According to inspections, many cadres are satisfied with a superficial understanding of the text and cannot identify or solve problems. When they pick up the book, it seems like they understand, but as soon as they put the book down, their minds are blank. In discussion meetings, they can say a few words at the beginning, but when pressed, they cannot explain further. Some cadres lack confidence or a spirit of inquiry in their theoretical studies. Therefore, leaders must strengthen ideological guidance, provide timely mobilization and explanation, and regularly make concise reports on relevant central issues. At the same time, they must guide good discussion meetings, guide everyone to analyze problems, strengthen the spirit of inquiry, improve learning effectiveness, and seek a thorough understanding of the issues. Secondly, clarify the purpose of learning. Before studying a document, everyone must know why they are studying it, which are the main issues to understand, and, if necessary, issue outlines as a starting point for discussing problems. This can help cadres grasp the center and study in depth. We did this when studying "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," and it worked well; but we did not do this when studying "The History of Social Development," and the effect was poor. Thirdly, in connecting with reality, it is necessary to prevent subjective speculation about the past or imaginary ideas about the future. Help cadres analyze problems from a historical materialist viewpoint. But this is often not easy to do, and it is necessary to have comrades with a high level of theoretical understanding to explain, in order to inspire everyone in the method of connecting with reality. Fourthly, conscientiously establish inspection, commendation, criticism, and testing systems, which is an important link in ensuring effective learning. The following points should be noted in testing: (1) The questions should have room for development, in order to understand the cadres' degree of understanding and guide in-depth study; (2) The number of tests should not be too many, otherwise it will form a burden on the cadres, lead to learning for the sake of testing, and affect work; (3) The results of the tests must be announced, otherwise the effect of the tests will be reduced. After the test, it is necessary to organize discussions and answers. Facts have proven that cadres can easily understand the answers to the test questions.

    干部学习理论要求切实钻通
    通县专区总结经验
    要引导干部深入钻研  不能单从进度看成绩
    防止主观推想  提倡科学分析
    【本报河北讯】中共通县地委宣传科长田亚夫顷报导通县专区组织干部学习理论的经验称：领导上不能满足于布置、督促和要书面成绩，也不能单单以读完几章几节作为考察成绩的标准，而必须掌握从学习效果看成绩的标准。根据检查，不少干部对学习满足于字面了解，不能发现问题、解决问题。拿起书本子好像是懂了，一放书本，脑子就空了。在讨论会上，开始还能说几句，一追问又讲不出来了。有些干部对理论学习，或缺乏信心，或缺乏钻研精神。因此，领导上必须加强思想指导，及时动员解释，经常作扼要的有关中心问题的报告。同时要指导开好讨论会，引导大家分析问题，加强钻研精神，提高学习效果，求得对问题的切实了解。其次，明确学习目的。在学习一个文件之前，必须使大家知道为什么学它，主要的要了解那几个问题，必要时还可发一些提纲，作讨论问题的引子。这样可以帮助干部抓住中心，深入钻研。我们在学习《论人民民主专政》时这样做了，收效很好；而在学习《社会发展史》时没有这样做，收效就差。第三，在联系实际上，要防止主观地推测过去或臆想将来。要帮助干部以历史唯物观点去分析问题。但这常常不易做好，必须有理论水平较高的同志作讲解，以便在联系实际的方法上给大家以启发。第四，认真树立检查、表扬和批评、测验等制度，这是保证学习有效进行的重要一环。测验须注意以下几点：（一）题目要能有发挥的余地，借以了解干部的理解程度和引导深入钻研；（二）测验的次数不宜过多，否则会形成干部的负担，为测验而学习，影响工作；（三）测验的结果一定要公布，否则会减低测验作用。测验后必须组织讨论和解答，事实证明，试题的解答，干部最易领会。
