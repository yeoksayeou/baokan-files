    Eradicate Private Telephone Installation
    Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Mobilizes the Masses to Self-Report
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Telecommunications Bureau has once again issued a notice to telephone users, urging them to promptly self-report any privately installed telephones and complete the necessary procedures. Before the new year, the Bureau had notified all users that any violations of regulations, such as privately installing extension phones or attachments, unauthorized movement or replacement of handsets, or misreporting of telephone types, should be self-reported to the Bureau for rectification before the end of December. With special approval from higher authorities, lenient treatment was offered: users with privately installed extension phones only needed to pay the installation fee and deposit, and after changing to a Bureau-issued handset, they could continue using the phone; users who had moved their phones privately only needed to pay the moving fee and would not be penalized; users who had misreported the type of phone could apply to change the name or transfer ownership, and past underpayments of rental fees would not be retroactively charged. Although the deadline has passed, the Bureau fears that users may not have paid attention to the notice, and therefore extends the deadline for another month until the end of this month. If the deadline is missed again, penalties will be imposed according to regulations: users with privately installed extension devices will have their main phone temporarily suspended, and will only have their service restored after paying twice the installation fee for the extension equipment and the monthly rental fee from the date the main phone was rented (this rental fee will be limited to a maximum of twelve months). Users who have privately moved their phones or misreported the type of phone will be charged double the fees owed. Note: After liberation, telephone installation and relocation have been opened to the public, and users from all walks of life can apply for installation at will. Private installation and relocation, with self-designed wiring and methods that do not meet the prescribed standards, will not only be inconvenient to use, but also increase the load on the equipment, damage its lifespan, and consume electricity, thereby damaging the people's property. The Bureau also calls on all sectors to assist in reporting such activities.

    根绝私装电话行为
    京电信局发动群众自报
    【北京讯】北京电信局再次通告电话用户，迅速自报私装电话并办理手续。年前该局曾通告各用户凡私装副机、附件、私自将话机移动、更换和冒报种类等违反规章情事，限在十二月底以前自动到该局去补办手续，并得到上级批准特别从宽处理，私装副机用户仅需补缴装机费，押机费，改换局机后即可继续使用；私移用户，补缴移费后，亦不按罚则办理；冒报种类用户，去函声请更名或过户后，以往少缴的租费，亦不予追补。现在虽已过期，该局深恐各用户未曾注意，特再展限一个月至本月底止，倘再逾期，即将照章处罚，即：私装副件用户，先将正机暂停通话，须由用户补缴该项设备装设费的二倍，及自正机租用日起之逐月租费后，方予恢复通话（此项租费最多以十二个月为限）。私移及冒报种类用户，均照应补之费加倍收取。按：解放后电话装移已经开放，各界用户得随意请装。若私装私移，自设机线的程式和方法都不合规定标准，使用起来不但不会灵便，并且增加机件的负荷，损害机件寿命，耗费电力，也就是损害人民的财产。该局并呼吁各界协助检举。
