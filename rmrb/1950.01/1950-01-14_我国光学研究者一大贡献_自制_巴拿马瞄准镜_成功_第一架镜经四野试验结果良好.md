Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 13th. The former Beijing Research Institute of Physics, taken over by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has successfully designed and manufactured the "Panama Sight." The "Panama Sight" is a common combat instrument for artillery units in various countries, capable of aiming at targets and measuring their distance. This type of sight has a complex structure, and domestic optical researchers had previously been unable to manufacture it. In late July of last year, the Fourth Field Army commissioned the Beijing Research Institute of Physics to trial-produce it. After accepting this glorious task, the research staff of the institute's optical department, despite extremely insufficient material equipment, worked diligently for two months and finally produced the first Chinese-made "Panama Sight" in mid-October. The Fourth Field Army tested the sight, and the results were excellent. The institute is now preparing for mass production.

    我国光学研究者一大贡献
    自制“巴拿马瞄准镜”成功
    第一架镜经四野试验结果良好
    【新华社北京十三日电】中国科学院所接管的前北京研究院物理研究所设计制造“巴拿马瞄准镜”获得成功。“巴拿马瞄准镜”为世界各国炮兵部队通用的作战仪器，可以瞄准目的物，也可以测量目的物的距离。这种瞄准镜构造复杂，国内的光学研究者以前一直没有能够从事制造。去年七月底第四野战军委托北京研究院物理研究所试验制造，该所光学部门研究工作人员接受这项光荣的任务以后，在物质设备非常不足的条件下，经过两个月的艰苦工作，至十月中旬终于制成中国制造的第一架“巴拿马瞄准镜”。该镜经第四野战军试验结果，极为良好。现在该所正准备大批制造中。
