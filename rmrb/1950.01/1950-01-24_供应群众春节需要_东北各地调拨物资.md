    Supplying the Masses' Needs for the Spring Festival
    Materials Allocated from Various Parts of the Northeast
    [This newspaper dispatch] To supply the masses' need for food during the Spring Festival, state-owned grain companies, state-owned stores, and cooperatives in various parts of the Northeast have prepared sufficient flour, rice, soybean oil, and edible salt, and began allocating them to various parts of the Northeast from the 15th of this month.
    Furthermore, in order to further meet the needs of workers' lives, the Northeast Grain Corporation has prepared to continue to increase the allocation of Spring Festival flour and rice to industrial and mining areas such as Benxi, Anshan, and Fushun. In addition to stocking a large amount of grain, the Shenyang Grain Company also plans to transfer more than 20 million catties of coarse grains and more than one million catties of fine grains from northern to southern Manchuria to meet the needs of the citizens. Currently, in order to prevent the rise in grain prices that has historically occurred before the Spring Festival, grain companies at all levels began selling various coarse grains in major cities at the beginning of this month, and grain prices in various places are now very stable.

    供应群众春节需要
    东北各地调拨物资
    【本报讯】东北各地国营粮食公司、国营商店及合作社，准备足够面粉、大米、豆油、食盐，供应群众春节食品需要，并于本月十五日起开始分拨东北各地。
    又，东北粮食总公司为更进一步满足工人生活的需要，已准备继续向本溪、鞍山、抚顺等工矿区增拨春节面粉大米。沈阳粮食公司除备有大量粮食外，并计划由北满南调粗粮二千余万斤，细粮百余万斤以应市民需要。目前各级粮食公司为防止历来春节前粮价上涨，已于本月初，开始在各大城市抛售各种粗粮，现各地粮价均甚平稳。
