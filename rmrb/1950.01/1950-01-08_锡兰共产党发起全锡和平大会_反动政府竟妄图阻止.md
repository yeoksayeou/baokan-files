Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th. (TASS dispatch from Calcutta): The All-Ceylon Peace Conference, proposed by the Ceylon Communist Party, is scheduled to be held in Colombo from January 14th to 15th. The British Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference will also be held there at the same time. The Ceylon government is attempting to use this fact to prevent the All-Ceylon Peace Conference from being held. The Ceylon police have received special instructions to occupy all important buildings in Colombo and set up cordons on the city's main thoroughfares. The instructions stipulate that all persons arriving in Colombo must undergo "strict inspection" and that "undesirable elements" should be deported.

    锡兰共产党发起全锡和平大会
    反动政府竟妄图阻止
    【新华社北京七日电】塔斯社引电通社记者自加尔各答报道：锡兰共产党所提议召集的全锡兰和平大会，定于一月十四日至十五日在科伦坡举行。不列颠联邦外长会议亦于同时在该地召开。锡兰政府企图利用这一事实，制止全锡兰和平大会的召开。锡兰警察已接获特别训令，占领科伦坡所有重要建筑，并在该市主要通道设置警戒线。该训令规定所有到达科伦坡的人，均须经过“严格的检查”，并将“不良分子”押送出境。
