    [Beijing News] The first phase of land reform in the Beijing suburbs has concluded victoriously. Recently, expanded cadre meetings were held in various suburban districts to summarize the work of the first phase of land reform. In the land reform in the suburbs, according to preliminary statistics from seventy-seven villages, 100,940 farmers participated in this great revolutionary movement, and 46,023 farmers received the fruits of victory. In the fifty days of work, through rectifying organizations, opposing local tyrants, classifying social classes, adjusting and distributing land and agricultural implements, farmers were further educated and organized, and the prestige of the farmers' associations was enhanced. Seventy-six farmers' associations and seventy-four peasant representative meetings were established. Farmers' association membership increased from 22,030 to 33,512. In the seventy-seven villages, there were a total of 1,315 landlord households and 719 rich peasant households. A total of 150,536.86 mu of land was confiscated and requisitioned (the farmers who obtained land received an average of 3.27 mu each), along with 7,457 rooms, 420 livestock, 5,529,403 jin of grain, 217 large carts, 199 waterwheels, and 17,541 agricultural implements. This not only liberated the farmers politically and economically but also laid the foundation for developing rural production. In addition, a large number of activists emerged during the movement, requesting to join the Chinese Communist Party and the New Democratic Youth League. A total of 668 people have now been approved to join the Chinese Communist Party, and 70 Chinese Communist Party branches have been established. More than 1,500 people have joined the New Democratic Youth League, and 72 Youth League branches have been established. They all played a leading and exemplary role in the land reform.

Currently, work is beginning in twenty-one villages, social classes are being classified in forty-two villages, social class classification has been completed in twenty-three villages, and land and agricultural implements are being adjusted and distributed in sixteen villages.

    农民得地十五万亩
    发展农会会员三万余人
    【北京讯】京郊第一批土地改革已胜利结束，日前各郊区都分别召开了扩大干部会议，总结第一批土地改革工作。郊区土地改革中，据七十七个村庄初步统计，有十万零九千四百零四个农民参加了这一伟大的革命运动，四万六千零二十三个农民分得了胜利果实。在五十天的工作中，经过整顿组织、反恶霸、划阶级、调剂与分配土地、农具等工作，进一步教育与组织了农民，提高了农会的威信，成立了七十六个农会，七十四个农民代表会。农会会员由二万二千零三十人，发展为三万三千五百一十二人。七十七个村中共有地主一千三百一十五户，富农七百一十九户。共没收、征收土地十五万零五百三十六点八六亩（得地的农民平均每人得到三点二七亩），房屋七千四百五十七间，牲口四百二十头，粮食五百五十二万九千四百零三斤，没收大车二百一十七辆，水车一百九十九辆，农具一万七千五百四十一件。这样不但使农民在政治上、经济上得到解放，而且打下了发展农村生产的基础。此外，在运动中并涌现出大批积极分子，纷纷要求加入中国共产党及新民主主义青年团，现在已经被批准加入中国共产党的共有六百六十八人，建立了七十个中国共产党支部。一千五百余人加入新民主主义青年团，成立了七十二个团支部，他们在土地改革中都起了领导与带头的作用。
    又：郊区第二批土地改革工作已经在一百零二个村庄中进行，其中有五个村庄已进行过反恶霸斗争。目前二十一个村庄正开始工作，四十二个村庄正在划阶级，二十三个村庄已完成划阶级，十六个村庄在调剂分配土地、农具。丰台区于家胡同等三个村庄已展开第三批土地改革工作。
