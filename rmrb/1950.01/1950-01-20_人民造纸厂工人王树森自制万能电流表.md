    People's Paper Mill Worker Wang Shusen Self-Makes Universal Ammeter
    [This newspaper reported] The difficulty in checking the three-phase current of electric motors has been solved by the workers of the Beijing People's Paper Mill who created a universal ammeter. In the factory, checking the three-phase current of electric motors is of utmost importance. However, when checking with ordinary ammeters, the operation must be stopped before checking. No factory can afford to stop the motor solely for inspection when it is operating normally. The People's Paper Mill does not allow stopping the paper machine casually for current checks. Electrician Wang Shusen had long requested the factory to purchase a universal ammeter, but American-made universal ammeters on the market cost more than two thousand catties of millet. Due to the factory's financial difficulties, it could not be done immediately. Wang Shusen then resolved to make a universal meter himself. He utilized his spare time and used old materials from the substation to conduct repeated experiments. He believed that if Americans could do it, we should be able to do it too. After many experiments, he finally succeeded. On January 11, the meter panel and the entire meter were installed. In this way, the factory does not need to cut off power and can check the high-voltage lines, low-voltage lines, and three-phase current of electric motors at any location at any time. The meter's construction is divided into two parts. One part is made of thin iron sheets one inch wide and four inches long, formed into a square magnetic core three inches wide, four inches long, and one inch thick, forming a magnetic circuit. One end of the iron core is wrapped with a coil, and the other end is fastened with a spring buckle to allow it to open and close freely, forming a movable magnetic field to transform various currents of different wires. The other part uses a discarded ammeter casing, modifying the internal iron core and coil to make it a multiplication factor determination standard meter. Combining these two parts and installing a wooden handle structure creates a complete universal ammeter. The scale on the meter dial is determined by experimental methods, tested several times with a standard ammeter to obtain accurate values (amperes).

    人民造纸厂工人王树森自制万能电流表
    【本报讯】北京人民造纸厂工人创造万能电流表，检查电动机三相电流中的困难得到解决。在工厂里，检查电动机的三相电流是最重要的。但用普通的电流表检查时，一定要停止运转才能检查，电动机正常运转时，任何工厂也不能专为检查而使其停止。人民造纸厂更是不准许随便停止纸车而检查电流的。电工王树森早就请求厂方买一个万能电流表，但市面上美国的万能电流表需要两千多斤小米才能买到。厂方经济困难，未能马上办到。王树森便下决心要自造万能表。他利用工作余暇，利用变电所的旧材料，一再进行试验。他相信，只要美国人能做，我们就应当能做。经过多次试验，他终于研究成功了。一月十一日，连表盘及表全套都按装完毕。这样，工厂不用停电，随时随地都可以检查任何地点的高压线，低压线及电动机的三相电流。该表构造分为二部分，一部分用宽一英寸、长四英寸的薄铁片，做成宽三英寸长四英寸、厚一英寸的方形磁铁心，成为一个磁气回路。铁心之一端缠以线圈，他端用弹簧扣住，使之自由开关，构成一个活动磁场，借以变换不同电线之各种电流。另一部分，用一个废电流表壳，改装内部之铁心及线圈，使之成为倍率测定标准表。将此两部分合在一起，按装木把构造，则成为一个完整的万能电流表。其表盘之刻度，均以试验方法，以标准电流表试验数次，则得很准确之数值（安培）。（北京人民造纸厂厂长  田人）
