After Da San finished speaking, people were silent for a moment. Old Yin stood up to solicit opinions. The little foreign devil was the first to say, "Okay!" Shuan Cheng also said, "No one in our branch has any objections." Lin Bao, however, hesitated a bit, then smiled and said, "Okay, it's okay, but his thinking and temperament will have to be seriously reformed in the future; hehe, I wonder if that's right?" Da San quickly said, "Right!" Others also agreed with Lin Bao's words. Old Bai, on behalf of the District Committee, approved Da San's admission to the Party on the spot, and, accepting everyone's opinions, pointed out some of his shortcomings and told him to correct them in the future. Finally, it was announced that Da San would participate in the Party with a six-month probationary period for observation. Da San fully accepted this and slowly walked into the group of Party members around Shuan Cheng.

Then Lin Bao also requested to join the Party. He said, "I am a middle peasant. Since the struggle last spring, I even gave up some land; but now the land has been returned, and I have also been given some fruits. I am not oppressed, and the grain payments are light. I am very comfortable. I have decided that the only right path is to follow the Communist Party and work hard." Then Bai Quan's family also made a request, and three other people also requested to join. People only had no objections to Bai Quan's family and Lin Bao. Old Bai and Old Yin accepted these opinions and decided to wait for the District Committee to discuss them. Finally, Lin Bao led the people in shouting slogans: "Support the Communist Party!" "Support Chairman Mao!" The meeting dispersed. But as soon as the people dispersed, the little foreign devil shouted, "Don't go, everyone! See if I'm okay!" Liu Gou's family asked him, "What do you mean, if you're okay?" His old face couldn't help but turn red. Old Yin yelled for people to come back, but people returned unevenly. The Party members over there chattered for a while, and Shuan Cheng said, "Let's talk about Brother Ji Cheng later!" Everyone immediately shouted "Agreed!" and the people dispersed quickly. Liu Gou's family even rushed up to grab the little foreign devil, saying, "Aren't you ashamed? I wanted to say it too, but I didn't dare. Didn't you see..." The little foreign devil ignored her and instead sought out Old Yin. The two of them went aside to discuss. Over here, Liu Gou's family felt somehow uncomfortable and thought: I'll go find Bai Quan's family to talk to.

        Sixty Roots

By this time, the long-term and eternal liberation of the masses in Black Stone Slope Village had taken root. Not long after, the shareholders of the large kiln held another meeting at the Old Lord Temple. At the meeting, Da San reported the plans for the large kiln's future operations that the shareholder representatives had discussed, deciding that the forty people in the kiln should produce at least fifty tons of coal per day. The entire meeting passed it. Xi Lu reported the accounts for this period and, according to Da San's plans, calculated that the debts could be paid off in less than two months if the current supply and expenses were maintained. People couldn't help but clap their hands. Then, people decided that the manager and foreman would remain unchanged, that Tian Lu would be a free worker, and that Tai Cheng, Yu Bao, and others would lead different shifts. Wages were also increased a bit. Everyone also conducted a review according to the regulations set by everyone and rewarded Tian Lu and Da San. They even said that Yu Bao, Qian Da Nao, and the others hadn't done too badly. In addition, Niu Bao and Tai Cheng received some criticism. Then, everyone clamored to decide that the kiln workers of the large kiln should contact the kiln workers of other earth kilns and separately organize a coal mine trade union to specifically take care of the kiln workers' own affairs. Finally, everyone named the large kiln "Black Stone Slope Village Solidarity Emancipation Kiln" and clamored for a while about how the kiln would be expanded in the future, how machines would be installed... After a long time, people dispersed happily.

Then, the village discussed the shares of the kiln. At that time, the people who were not shareholders of the large kiln had a new idea, proposing that the cash borrowed by the kiln should not be repaid and should also be used as everyone's share. The original shareholders were naturally not very willing at first, but Old Yin felt that the kiln could not have been built without everyone borrowing cash anyway. Besides, Ju Bao's share in the kiln was originally for the whole village, so he persuaded the shareholders to agree to this idea. Finally, the village people discussed Xi Lu's share several times. Old Yin also discussed it with Xi Lu himself for a while. Xi Lu always refused to calculate more shares for himself. He also said calmly at the meeting: "Our kiln was destroyed long ago by the traitors Yan Xishan and his ilk. I made up my mind long ago to abandon it! Now that the world has been turned upside down, with the Communist Party's good policies, everyone is united and struggling against traitors, feudal landlords, and the kiln has been restored. This is the credit of our whole village! But if it had been given to me back then, I wouldn't have been able to raise the capital even in ten or eight years! Let's talk about public loans! This is the whole village's big production for earning food and drink! I don't know anything, so can I manage it? Now the public is helping us and leading us, and everyone is investing capital, spending free labor, thinking day and night, trying to find solutions, enduring hardships to build the kiln. This is all the power of everyone! Old Yin often says: The power of the masses is greater than the sky! This time, I have seen it clearly and without a single omission! In the past, those who wanted to make a splash and use force wanted to call me to manage it. I dare say that it would never have turned out like this! If I were allowed to manage it alone in the future, it would definitely not work! Comrade Old Yin told me not to always rely on the public and everyone, and told me to do it myself. It won't work! Not being able to repay the capital is a small matter for everyone. I'm afraid the production will be ruined! Anyway, I won't say anything else. As for the kiln, I won't say it's not mine; but as for cooperation, shareholding, and profit sharing, let's do it equally with everyone! If not, I won't accept it anywhere."

    黑石坡煤窑演义（６５）
    康濯
    大三说完，人们一时还没话，老尹起来征求意见，小洋鬼头一个说：“行！”拴成也说：“咱支部里的都没意见。”林宝却忸怩了两下，笑着说：“行是行，只是他这思想脾性的，往后还得正经好好改改；嘿嘿，不知对不？”大三忙道：“对！”别人也都同意林宝的话，老白就代表区委当场批准了大三入党，并接受大伙的意见，给大三提了一些缺点，要他往后改正，最后，又宣布大三参加党有半年候补期进行考察；大三完全接受了，就慢腾腾地走进拴成那一圪堆党员里边去了。
    下边林宝也要求参加党，他说：“咱是个中农，去年春起浑闹斗争，咱还拿出了地；可这会地也退了，咱还分了些果实，也不受压迫，粮款掏得也轻，咱也是舒坦的不行。咱算认定了，就只有跟着共产党走，好好劳动，才是正道。”接着白泉家也提了要求，并还有三个人要求，人们只对白泉家和林宝没意见；老白老尹接受了这些意见，决定等区委讨论了再说。末了，林宝领着人们吆喝起口号：“拥护共产党！”“拥护毛主席！”会就散了。但人们刚走散，小洋鬼却嚷了起来：“大伙甭走！看看咱行不行！”柳沟家问他：“你什么行不行？”他的老脸皮不觉红了红；老尹吆喝人们回来，但人却回得长短不齐，那边党员们咯嚷了一阵，拴成说：“咱吉成哥往后再说吧！”别人立时一声“同意！”人就大走散了。柳沟家还赶上去拉住小洋鬼说：“你不害羞臊？我也想说，可还不敢哩，没见你……”小洋鬼没理她，却寻上老尹，二人到一边捣拉去了；这边柳沟家心中不知怎么也有些难受，就想着：寻白泉家捣拉捣拉去。
            六十  根基
    到这时候，黑石坡村群众长年永辈的翻身，算是扎下根基了。不久，大窑股东们又在老君庙上开了个大会，会上大三报告了股东代表们对大窑往后动弹合计的谱谱，决定光窑底下四十号人，每天出炭起码五十吨，大会全体通过。喜禄报告了这些时的账目，并按大三的谱谱合算出：还照现在的供应开销，不用两个月就能把欠账还清；人们不觉拍开了巴掌。接着，人们决定经理和领事不变，天禄当闲工头，泰成玉宝等人领岔，工资也多少都加了点。大家又按全体订的规章进行了检讨，奖励了天禄大三，连玉宝乾大脑人们也说他们动弹得不算很赖；另外，牛宝和泰成受了点批评。下边大家又咯嚷着决定：大窑窑黑们联络上别的土窑的窑黑，单另组织煤窑工会，专门照管窑黑们自己的事。最后，大伙又给这大窑取名叫“黑石坡村团结翻身窑”，并乱咯嚷了一阵往后这窑要怎么往大里闹，怎么安上机器……老大一会，人们才欢欢喜喜地散会。
    接着，村里讨论窑上的股子。当时不是大窑股东的人们却有了个新意见，提出让窑上借的现洋不用还了，也作大伙入的股；原股东们一时自然不大乐意，但老尹觉得这窑反正大伙要不借现洋也闹不成，再说，这窑上聚宝的那份原也就是浑村大伙的，他便说服股东们同意了这个意见。最后，喜禄的股子，村里人们讨论了好几回，老尹又跟喜禄自己商议了一阵，喜禄始终不肯多算股，他并且在大会上平心静气地说：“咱这窑是早就给汉奸阎锡山们毁了的，咱自个也老早就下定决心撂球它了！如今天地翻了个过，有共产党的好政策，大伙又一心团结跟汉奸封建地主斗争，把这窑又闹回来了，这是咱浑村的功劳！可当日要给了咱吧，咱再筹划十年八年也闹不上垫本哩！就说公家贷款吧！这是浑村仗着挣吃喝的个大生产哩！咱一门不摸，就能经管么？现在公家帮助咱领导咱，大伙出垫本花白工没明没夜想办法拿主意熬着受着，把窑闹成了，这也全是大伙的力量！老尹常说：群众的力量比天还大！这回我可是亲身亲眼一丝不漏地看的清清楚楚吧！过去一起头打水弄武的要叫咱来经管，我敢说怎么也闹不成这样！往后如若也让咱一个人经管，也准没法闹！老尹同志叫我别老想依靠公家大伙，叫我自个来闹，不行的！垫本还不起大伙倒是小事，还怕生产闹球不成哩！反正咱别的也不说，窑嘛，咱也不说就不是咱的；可这合作碰股分红，咱跟大伙半斤八两，一样样来吧！若不的话，那咱可说到哪里也不承受。”
