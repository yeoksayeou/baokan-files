    Hebei Native Products Sales Opened Up
    Exports Account for Sixty-Two Percent of Total Output
    [This newspaper dispatch] Hebei Province's native product companies, through vigorously organizing the export of native products and mountain goods, have opened up sales channels for general native products and mountain goods. As of the end of last year, exports accounted for approximately sixty-two percent of the total output. Some mountainous areas of Hebei Province are rich in mountain goods such as peach kernels, apricot kernels, peppercorns, persimmons, chestnuts, black dates, and native medicinal materials, which are important sources of income for local farmers. According to statistics from seven special districts including Xingtai, Handan, and Tangshan, the mountain goods and medicinal materials produced this year, converted at the November rice price, can be exchanged for more than 130 million catties of rice. However, in the past, poor sales affected people's lives. Later, through the efforts of the Shijiazhuang, Handan, Tangshan, Anguo and other native product professional branches and sub-companies, since the autumn of last year, the sales channels for major mountain goods and medicinal materials have gradually opened up. According to current statistics: more than 36.58 million catties of mountain goods and medicinal materials have been exported throughout the province. During the purchasing process, each native product company, in a planned manner, combined with salt industry, grain, department store and other professional companies, purchased goods through cooperatives in various places on the one hand, and supplied farmers with daily necessities on the other. The goods purchased by Handan and Shijiazhuang native product companies through cooperatives accounted for 70 to 80 percent of the total. At the same time, they supplied mountain farmers with more than 10,000 bolts of homespun cloth, 250,000 catties of edible salt, more than 500 bolts of foreign cloth, 2,800 catties of kerosene, 1,000 catties of pigments, and a large amount of grain. The Tangshan Native Product Branch (formerly Jidong Trading Company) supplied local farmers with 900,000 catties of rice in the autumn to exchange for chestnuts. The chestnuts have now been recovered and transported to Tianjin.
    In order to prevent farmers from suffering losses, the company appropriately increased the ratio of native products and mountain goods to grain when purchasing. For example, peach kernels could only be exchanged for two to three catties of rice per catty last year, but now it has been raised to five to six catties. In addition, some areas have also paid attention to uniting legitimate merchants to purchase in remote mountainous areas, so that the mountain goods accumulated by farmers in these areas can also be exported. Loans from the People's Bank of Handan, Anguo, and other places to support the export of native products accounted for more than 40 to 50 percent of the total loans (including public and private). The Anguo Bank specifically organized three households, including Fuxingchang, to handle the export of native products through ordering, conversion, mortgage, and short-term loans, so that the previously closed export merchants such as Hongda Zhan were able to resume business. At the same time, it also drove a lot of private capital. In Handan alone, private capital drove the purchase of 48,500 catties of peach kernels and more than 14,000 catties of peppercorns. Shijiazhuang merchants are also very active in exporting native products, and the current exports account for 32 percent of the city's total exports.
    In order to improve quality, reduce costs, and drive mass sideline production, Shijiazhuang and Huolu have also established two primary processing factories for native products, which now have 300 workers. After processing, white melon seeds reduce their weight by more than 20 percent, and Scutellaria baicalensis reduces its weight by six times. This not only improved the quality, but also reduced transportation costs, creating more favorable conditions for future exports. The sales problem was discussed at the provincial native product company managers' meeting held last December. After exchanging information and research, it was unanimously agreed that the sales channels for general mountain goods have been opened up, and only the mountain goods in a few areas (such as Handan's peppercorns) need to be strengthened by internal transfer to solve the problem.

    河北土产销路打开
    输出占总产量百分之六十二
    【本报讯】河北省各土产公司，经大力组织土产山货输出，目前一般土产山货销路已打开，截至去年底，输出已占总产量百分之六十二左右。河北省部分山地，盛产桃仁、杏仁、花椒、柿、栗、乌枣及土产药材等山货，为当地农民重要收入之一。据邢台、邯郸、唐山等七个专区统计，今年出产之山货、药材按十一月份米价折合能换米一亿三千余万斤。但过去因销路不畅，影响人民生活，后经石家庄、邯郸、唐山、安国等土产专业分、支公司的努力，自去年秋季至今，主要山货药材已逐渐打开销路。按目前统计：全省已输出山货、药材三千六百五十八万多斤。在收购当中，各该土产公司均有计划地结合盐业、粮食、百货等专业公司通过各地合作社，一面收购，一面供给农民生活必需品。邯郸、石家庄两土产公司通过合作社收购货物占总数字的百分之七十到八十。同时供给了山地农民土布万余匹，食盐二十五万斤，洋布五百余匹，煤油二千八百斤，颜料一千斤及大批粮食。唐山土产支公司（原冀东贸易公司）于秋季曾以九十万斤米供给当地农民交换栗子，现栗子已经收回运津。
    为了不使农民吃亏，公司在收购土产、山货时，适当地提高了对粮食的比价，如桃仁去年每斤只换米二至三斤，现已提到五至六斤。此外，由于有的地区还注意了团结正当商人到山里偏僻地区采购，使该地农民积存的山货也得以输出。邯郸、安国等地人民银行扶植土产出口的贷款，已占总放款百分之四十到五十以上（包括公私营）。安国行通过订货、折实、抵押及短期借贷，具体组织了复兴昌等三户办理土产输出，使已歇业的出口商户宏大栈等都又复业。同时还带动了不少私人资本，只邯郸就带动私资收购桃仁四万八千五百斤，花椒一万四千余斤。石家庄商人输出土产业务，也很活跃，目前输出已占全市总输出的百分之三十二。
    为了提高质量、减低成本，带动群众副业生产，石家庄、获鹿还成立了两个土产初级加工工厂，现已有三百名工人。加工后白瓜子减低重量百分之二十以上，黄芩减低六倍。不但提高了质量，同时还减少了运费，对今后输出造成更有利的条件。目前的销路问题，在去年十二月召开的省内各地土产公司经理会议上，经互相交流情况与研究的结果，一致认为：一般山货已打开销路，仅少数地区的山货（如邯郸的花椒），尚待加强内地调运来解决。
