    A Reformed Midwife – Granny Guo
    Shen Yuanhui
    The first class of graduates from the North China Public Health Personnel Training Class formed a rural health work team and were sent to the countryside to promote health work. The female comrades were responsible for conducting maternal and child health publicity, implementing new methods of delivery, and reforming old-style midwives on the spot, enabling them to understand some new delivery methods, gradually eliminating infantile tetanus (commonly known as "fourth-sixth wind") and postpartum fever in lying-in women. The work team also worked with the government and the Women's Federation to organize midwife training classes. The second work team ran a class in Tong County that lasted a week and had a total of sixteen students, ten of whom were old-style midwives and six of whom were married women. Although they were illiterate, they worked hard during the training, relying on classroom demonstrations and operations, and memorizing with their hearts. After graduating, they returned to their original villages to take up work. Now, let's introduce the work of one typical midwife – Granny Guo.
    Granny Guo is from Shuangshu Village in Tong County and is 57 years old. She has twelve years of experience in old-style midwifery in the village. Her family belongs to the poor peasant class, with a family of four: she, her husband, a son, and a little girl. She was very happy to attend the training class this time, because she learned how to deliver babies without causing "fourth-sixth wind." According to her, "Usually, old-fashioned midwives delivered babies, and five out of ten children would die from 'fourth-sixth wind'." She worked hard during the training, reciting the daily lectures while eating and in bed at night. She truly accepted the new method of delivery. After returning from the training class, she asked someone to write down what she had learned in a notebook, fearing she would forget it over time. The next day, with the help of a women's cadre, she convened a meeting of women in the village, where she reported on her training experience and her new methods for the future. This was equivalent to her carrying out a mobilization effort for everyone. Soon, people came to her for deliveries. In nearly a month, she delivered six families, and both adults and children were healthy, which the families welcomed very much. Among them was Chen Hongquan's family, who had previously had seven pregnancies, all of which ended in miscarriage or death from "fourth-sixth wind," with none surviving. This time, thanks to Granny Guo's delivery, both the adult and the child were doing very well. Chen Hongquan's family didn't know how to thank her enough.
    We sent cadres to Shuangshu Village twice to guide Granny Guo's work. After the families explained and she reported herself, we understood that she was indeed working according to the methods she had learned. She cut her nails very short, washed her hands with hot water and soap before delivery, and used shochu for wiping and disinfection when available. Before the delivery, she went to the family to help make umbilical cord cloths and ropes, and had them sterilized in a steamer for three hours. She prepared a pair of scissors specifically for cutting the baby's umbilical cord, and boiled or burned the scissors with fire before using them. The umbilical cord was left a little more than an inch long and then wrapped in sterilized cloth. Afraid we wouldn't believe her, she even kept the dried umbilical cords that had fallen off, waiting for us to inspect them. In the past, according to old customs, babies were rolled on the sandy soil after birth, making them very dirty and not washed. This time, Granny Guo also followed our method of wiping the baby's body clean with oil. For the lying-in woman, she padded the lower body with grass paper that had been roasted over a fire. After the birth, she asked the woman to lie down and rest to avoid excessive bleeding. Regarding the issue of lying down and resting, some people in the village opposed her due to old habits, but she used reasoning to convince them. Once, she encountered a lying-in woman who was delivering relatively slowly. Because she had been trained, she dared not recklessly reach in and touch anything. She immediately asked someone to our training class to ask a midwife to check and deal with the situation. When the placenta was slow to descend, she knew to use her hands to knead the uterus in the abdomen. In this way, Granny Guo's delivery method gradually gained the trust of the masses in the village, playing a great role in transforming the old delivery methods in the countryside.

    一位改造后的接生婆——郭大娘
    沈元晖
    华北公共卫生人员训练班第一期毕业学员，组成乡村卫生工作组，派到农村去推行卫生工作，女同志负责进行妇婴卫生宣传，实施新法接生，并就地改造旧式接生婆，使她们懂得一些新的接生方法，逐渐来普遍消灭婴儿破伤风（俗名“四六风”），及产妇产褥热；工作组并与政府及妇联会协同举办接生婆训练班。第二工作组在通县办的一班，训练一个星期，共有学员十六人，其中有十人是旧式接生婆，六人是已婚妇女。她们虽然不识字，但在受训期间，能努力学习，凭着在课室的示范和操作，用心来记忆。她们毕业后，就回到原乡村去担任工作了。现在介绍其中一位典型的接生婆——郭大娘的工作。
    郭大娘是通县双树村人，年五十七岁，她在这村上已有了十二年旧法接生历史。她家是贫农成份，全家四口人：她和她的丈夫、一个儿子和一个小女孩。这次她到训练班受训，是非常高兴的，因为她知道了怎样接生婴儿就不得“四六风”。据她说：“平常旧式老娘婆接生，接十个孩子要有五个得‘四六风’死的。”她在受训期间很努力，吃饭的时候和晚上睡在床上，都在默读每天讲的课，她真正接受了新法接生。她从训练班回去后，把所学的东西，求别人给她记在本子上，怕日久忘记了；第二天她在妇女干部帮助下，召开村上妇女群众会，她向大家报告了受训经过，及她今后的新办法。这样一来也就等于她对大家做了一次动员工作。不久就有人找她接生了，将近一个月的工夫共接生六家，大人孩子都健康，产家都很欢迎。其中有一个陈鸿泉家，过去生了七胎，都是小产和得“四六风”死了，一个也没落住，这次经郭大娘接生，大人小孩都很好。陈鸿泉家不知怎样感激她才好。
    我们曾两次派干部到双树村指导郭大娘工作，经产家说明和她自己报告，了解她确实是按照所学的方法去作的。她的指甲剪的很短，接生前用热水肥皂洗手，有烧酒时还用它来抹擦消毒，在产前她到产家帮助作脐带布，脐带绳子，让他们在蒸笼里消毒三小时。她自备了一把剪子，专为孩子断脐带用，用前把剪子煮开或用火烧过，脐带留一寸多长，再用消毒布包好。她怕我们不信，还把脱落下的干脐带留着，等我们去检查。过去旧习惯孩子生下来，都在砂土上滚的很脏，不洗澡，这次郭大娘，也按我们的法子用油把孩子身上擦的很净，产妇下身，垫上在火上烤过的草纸，生后，她要产妇躺着休息，免得出血过多。对于躺着休息这个问题，村上人因为旧习惯的关系，有些人反对她，但她用道理来说服她们。有一次她遇到一个产妇生的比较慢，她因为受过训，决不敢乱动手去掏了，她即刻找人到我们训练班请助产士去检查和处理。遇到胎盘下的慢，她就懂得用手在腹部揉捏子宫。这样，郭大娘的接生法，在村里渐渐获得了群众的信任，对于改造农村里的旧的接生方法，起了极大的推动作用。
