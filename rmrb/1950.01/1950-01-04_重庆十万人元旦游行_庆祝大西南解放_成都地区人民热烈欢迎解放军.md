Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd: People from all walks of life in Chongqing held a grand parade on New Year's Day to celebrate the liberation of Chongqing, the liberation of Chengdu, and the liberation of Southwest China. Over 100,000 citizens participated. The parade started at 11:00 AM from Shangqingsi Road, circled the main streets of the city, and dispersed at Nan'an Park at 7:00 PM, covering a distance of more than 30 li. The People's Liberation Army and the workers' contingents, carrying countless giant portraits of Chairman Mao and five-star national flags, marched at the front of the procession, followed by students and other citizens who strode forward, singing and dancing to their hearts' content. Professors, industrialists, businessmen, and staff members who had never participated in parades before also excitedly joined the parade this time. The spectators were shoulder to shoulder, and the road was jammed. The waist drum team of the People's Liberation Army's cultural troupe won unanimous applause from the citizens.

Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 3rd: When the People's Liberation Army marched towards Chengdu, they were warmly welcomed by the masses along the way. Citizens in the newly liberated towns and cities in western Sichuan quickly organized various temporary organizations to support and supply the army. When the vanguard of the People's Liberation Army, chasing the Hu Zongnan bandit troops, arrived in the Wumiaogou area of Jianyang, the local villagers rushed from various villages to the market to help the People's Liberation Army raise grain and fodder. An old farmer surnamed Zhu in Tuwang Township, Huayang County, braved the rain to spread a pile of rice husks on the muddy mountain road where the army was marching, so that the army could advance quickly. They said to the PLA soldiers, "Attack Chengdu quickly and win more battles!" The people of Liugong Township and Jitianpu in Renshou County set off firecrackers to welcome the army. The villagers of Jigao Township heard that the PLA troops attacking Chengdu would pass by here, and they had already slaughtered two pigs to prepare for comforting them. The streets and roadsides along the way were full of people, receiving the PLA as if they were their long-lost relatives. They unanimously praised the good discipline of the People's Liberation Army, saying: "They are truly a civilized army!"
