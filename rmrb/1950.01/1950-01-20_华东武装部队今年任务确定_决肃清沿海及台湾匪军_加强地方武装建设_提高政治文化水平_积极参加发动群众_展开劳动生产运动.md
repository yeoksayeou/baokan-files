Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th—The East China Military Region and the Third Field Army's CPC Front Committee issued a decision to the East China Armed Forces regarding the six major tasks for 1950, calling on all units to implement them. The decision stipulates the six major tasks as follows:

(1) Thoroughly annihilate the Chiang bandit troops in the southeast coast and Taiwan, and cooperate with fraternal corps to complete the glorious task of liberating the whole country. In the process of completing the above tasks, all work should revolve around them, so as to fully complete all pre-war preparations and specific measures after occupation. Overcome any thoughts of underestimating the enemy, arrogance, and paralysis after the battle is over. In particular, all personnel should be organized to work hard to study the tactics and techniques of liberating coastal islands and landing operations to capture Taiwan, strengthen wartime political work and logistical work, and ensure the smooth completion of the campaign tasks.

(2) Strengthen the construction of local armed forces in the military region. In the old liberated areas, the focus should be on militia work. In the newly liberated areas, a certain number of local armed forces must be developed, and the existing local armed forces should be reorganized and constructed, so that the local armed forces can assume the tasks of eliminating remaining bandits and special agent armed forces, strengthening social security, cooperating with the main forces to consolidate the rear, and defending the border. Oppose complacency and neglect of the construction of local armed forces.

(3) Strengthen political education and land reform education, continue to improve the political consciousness of the troops, consolidate political discipline, enforce military discipline, and improve political level. Strengthen military construction, earnestly improve and construct logistical work, oppose bureaucracy and guerrillaism, accelerate the regularization of the troops, and make them more modernized.

(4) Conscientiously run various schools, absorb a large number of progressive young intellectuals, vigorously organize on-the-job cadre study, train cadres in large numbers to adapt to the needs of the new situation, and strive to eliminate illiteracy in the troops and improve on the existing cultural level. Popularize scientific knowledge education, improve the military, political, and cultural level of the troops, and oppose narrow conservatism and arrogance.

(5) Effectively cooperate and actively participate in the work of mobilizing, organizing, and training the masses, support the land reform policy, help establish new district regimes and local armed forces, and assume the glorious task of work teams. Oppose departmentalism and blind sectarianism, strictly abide by discipline, and strengthen the relationship between the army and the people.

(6) Respond to Chairman Mao's call to launch a labor production movement in the entire army to reduce the burden on the people and improve the lives of the troops. In order to cooperate with the country to overcome financial and economic difficulties and lay the foundation for future large-scale production, practice strict economy, oppose extravagance and waste, cherish the people's property and weapons, and continue to maintain and carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle.
