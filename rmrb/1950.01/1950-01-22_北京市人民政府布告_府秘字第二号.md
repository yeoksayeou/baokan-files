Article 5. Admission certificates are divided into two types: regular and temporary. The validity period of regular admission certificates is one year, and they shall be reviewed every six months and reissued upon expiration. The validity period of temporary admission certificates shall be determined based on needs.

Article 6. The Exchange shall establish a number of traders as needed for its business, who shall be responsible for introducing transactions.

During trading, they shall conduct buying and selling according to their business nature. Wholesalers shall only be allowed to sell goods, retailers shall only be allowed to buy goods, and manufacturers or processing factories shall only be allowed to buy raw materials and sell finished products. However, if it is indeed for material exchange, it may be changed with the approval of the Exchange.

Article 8. Those who enter the Exchange for trading must entrust traders to introduce buying and selling. The price shall be freely and openly agreed upon by both the buying and selling parties, without restrictions.

Article 9. After a transaction is completed, the entrusted trader shall fill out three copies of the transaction form, which shall be sealed by both the buying and selling parties and the trader, and each shall retain one copy. The trader shall compile and report the daily transaction situation to the Exchange.

Article 11. After a transaction is completed, the buyer shall hold the transaction form and pay the seller to pick up the goods on the same day. If, when picking up the goods, the quality of the goods is found to be inconsistent, or other disputes occur that cannot be resolved by themselves, the Exchange shall be responsible for mediation, but shall not be liable for compensation for losses.
