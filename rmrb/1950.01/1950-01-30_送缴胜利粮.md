    "Delivering Victory Grain"

            I. The Grain Release List
    On December 21st of last year, the No. 4 Bao Grain Collection Committee of Daishan Township, Second District, Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, announced the final grain list, with 286 households named. When the news of the list being released was spread by the Farmers' Association, peasants from all the villages gathered to see the list like a tide, vying to find their names on the list. The scene was like the scholars leaving the imperial examination hall in the old days. Wan Changyi, a farmer from Gangshang Village, danced with joy after seeing the list. Unfortunately, he stumbled and fell into the muddy ground, getting covered in mud. He quickly got up and ran to the small market to buy two strings of firecrackers and set them off under the grain list, shouting. Following him, Ouyang Guangsheng, a farmer from Yangmen Village, and Wan Xiangzhou, a farmer from Houwan Village, also set off large strings of firecrackers. According to Wan Changyi, he rented three *shi* of land from landlord Xu Feihong. This year, after the Liberation Army came, his rent was reduced by seven and a half *dan*. This time, he only needs to deliver one *dan*, three *dou*, five *sheng*, and eight *he* of public grain, and he still has more than six *dan* left, enough to eat through the spring famine next year. He doesn't have to borrow money from the landlord anymore. He also said, "This year, every farmer is happy. With rent reduction and grain payment, we have rice to eat. In the past, on this day, the homes of farmers would have already been emptied." In the crowd, there was an old man wearing old-fashioned spectacles to look at the list. He read and nodded, and finally said with emotion, "Times have really changed. I have lived for sixty-five years and have only seen people being tied up and beaten, men crying and women wailing, and endless demands for money and grain. I have never seen the common people so happy when paying grain."
            II. Exempted From Public Grain
    Hu Shilin lives in the small market of Taizidian and has 1.6 *mu* of land. His family of seven relies entirely on his hard work in gardening and growing vegetables. The vegetables and radishes he grows are fat and tender. Last March, when the Kuomintang bandit troops were fleeing from Nanchang, they passed through here and demanded fifty *jin* of vegetables from him every day. In less than a month, they ate up all his vegetables from the previous season. His wife was driven mad with anger. After the Liberation Army came, he was assessed as an exemption household for this grain payment. He received the notice and immediately ran to the Farmers' Association, saying to the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, "The Communist Party and the Liberation Army saved me and exempted my family from public grain. I will remember this in my heart until I die. Next year, I, Hu Shilin, will definitely cultivate more land and deliver more public grain. I will not be an exemption household anymore."
            III. Everyone Is Busy Delivering Victory Grain Together
    The farmers of Houwan Village and Gangshang Village in the Fourth Bao, responding to the call of the Farmers' Association, launched a household-by-household grain delivery movement on December 25th of last year. At dawn on the 25th, men, women, old, and young in the whole village, at the sound of a gong, the grain delivery teams from the three villages flowed towards the road like a tide, with wheelbarrows, carrying poles, and backpacks. Young farmers pushed wheelbarrows in front as pathfinders, and old men and old women pulled the ropes on the carts step by step, while young men and youths carried backpacks, singing and laughing, "Everyone is busy, delivering victory grain." The committee members of the Farmers' Association specially found several carts to provide free grain delivery for the elderly, weak, and disabled grain households. The grain delivery line was divided into three teams at the start, with Wan Changyi, a Farmers' Association committee member from Gangshang Village, and Wan Renguan, a Farmers' Association committee member from Qianwan Village, as captains. Wan Xiangzhou from Houwan Village, the director of the Farmers' Association, pushed a wheelbarrow weighing four *shi*, with two people pulling the rope for him in front, and he greeted people at the back of the team. Farmer Wan Changyou said, "We are delivering public grain to the People's Government as if we are harvesting rice from our own fields and putting it into our own granaries." This sentence shows the farmers' understanding of public grain.

    “送缴胜利粮”
    金马
            一、放粮榜
    去年十二月二十一日，江西南昌县二区岱山乡第四保征粮委员会公布最后一次粮榜，有二百八十六户题名。当放榜的消息由农会传出后，各村子的农民如潮涌一般的聚集来看榜，大家争先恐后的在粮榜上找寻自己的名字，这盛况好像从前的举子下科场一样。岗上村的农民万长宜看榜之后兴奋得手舞足蹈起来，不巧一交跌在泥泞的地上弄得满身污泥，他连忙爬起来跑到小集上去买了两条爆竹燃放在粮榜下叫喊起来。接着阳门村的农民欧阳广生，和后万村的农民万祥周也手提一大串火爆在燃放着。据万长宜说：他佃种了地主徐飞红三石田，今年解放军来了他减回七担半租子，这一次公粮只送缴一担三斗五升八合，自己还多了六担多，足够吃过明年春荒时候，从此不用向地主借债了。他还说：“今年种田人那一个不快活，减租纳粮赚米下肠。往年的今天，种田人家里可早光了。”在人丛中有一位老太公，他戴上一副老光眼镜来看榜，一边念，一边点头，末了他很感动的说：“日子真是变了，我活了六十五岁，只看见要钱粮时捆人打人、男哭女叫的、一催二讨的才完事，就没有看见过纳粮时老百姓自己还这样快活的。”
            二、免我出公粮
    胡士林住在太子殿小集上，有一亩六分田，家中七口人全靠他一双手溉园种菜来生活。他种的青菜、萝卜又肥又嫩。去年三月间，国民党匪军从南昌逃命下来路过这里，天天要派他五十斤蔬菜来吃，不到一个月把他去年上季的蔬菜吃得精光。老婆子气得发疯。解放军来后，这一次缴公粮他被评为免征户，他接到通知立刻跑到农会里来，向着毛主席和朱总司令的像说：“共产党解放军救了我，又免我家的公粮，我心里死也记得。明年我胡士林一定要多种田送公粮，不作免征户了。”
            三、大家一齐忙送缴胜利粮
    四保前后万村、岗上村的农民，响应农会的号召，去年十二月二十五日，来一个家家户户送粮运动。全村男女老幼，在二十五日的拂晓，铜锣一敲，三个村子的送粮队伍像潮水一般的向公路上流去，有土车，有挑担，有背包。年青的农民推着土车在前面作开路先锋，老太公和老表嫂子拉着车上的绳一步一步向前迈进，小伙子、后生子背着包，有说有笑的唱着歌“大家一齐忙，送缴胜利粮。”农会的委员特别找了几乘车替老弱残废的粮户义务送粮。送粮的行列在出发时分为三个队，岗上村的农会委员万长义和前万村的农会委员万仁官作队长。后万村的万祥绸是农会主任，他推了四石重的土车，两个人在前面替他拉绳，在队伍的最后面打招应，农民万长有说：“我们把公粮送缴人民政府好像把稻子从自己的田里收进自家的仓里一样。”这句话说明了农民们对公粮的认识。
