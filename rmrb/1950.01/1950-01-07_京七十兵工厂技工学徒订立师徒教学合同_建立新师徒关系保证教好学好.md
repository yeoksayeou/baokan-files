    Beijing No. 70 Ordnance Factory Technician Apprentices Sign Master-Apprentice Teaching Contracts to Establish New Master-Apprentice Relationships and Ensure Good Teaching and Good Learning
    [This newspaper dispatch] Technicians Du Yongshou, Chu Zirong, and Zhao Yichun from the Sixth Institute of the Beijing No. 70 Ordnance Factory, along with apprentices Yuan Changbin, Zhao Yongsheng, and Feng Shifu, with the help of the Communist Youth League branch, in order to teach and learn technology well, and break down past conservative ideas, established a new master-apprentice relationship. On December 30th of last year, based on the spirit of respecting the teacher and loving the apprentice, they signed a master-apprentice contract. The contract clearly stipulates the attitudes that masters and apprentices should have and the learning plan. For example, the apprentice should respect the master and accept the master's guidance; not aim too high, but honestly and humbly learn; not leave the machine tool without reason, diligently wipe the machine, and add oil frequently; take care of the tools, ensure they are tidy and clean, and use them skillfully; be diligent, watch more, ask more, and do more. The master should cherish the apprentice, teach conscientiously according to the apprentice's actual ability, be diligent with words, not be afraid of trouble, explain more about the working principles and experience, and allow the apprentice to work on the machine tool as much as possible without hindering the completion of the task. In terms of the learning plan: the learning plan for the lathe operator is to pick out buckles and calculate wheels, calculate and rotate slopes, learn to grind simple lathe tools (such as rotary knives, finishing knives, cutting knives, etc.) and be able to rotate simple things. The learning plan for the milling worker is the working method of the milling machine, being able to mill gear wheels, open milling cutter movement, hanging wheels, and indexing plate calculation. Masters and apprentices guaranteed at the contract signing meeting that they would be able to teach and learn well. Learning progress will be checked by an inspector every month. The learning period is from January 1950 to the end of June. The factory's Party, government, labor union, and Youth League leaders all gave speeches at the meeting, saying: It is hoped that everyone will work hard to break down old conservative ideas and establish new master-apprentice relationships.
