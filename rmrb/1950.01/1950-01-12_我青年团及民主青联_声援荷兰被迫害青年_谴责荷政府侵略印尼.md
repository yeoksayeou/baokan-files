Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 11th: The World Federation of Democratic Youth has written to the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, calling on Chinese youth to support the struggle of Dutch youth against the Dutch government's imperialist war in Indonesia. The China New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth have jointly sent a letter to the Dutch Youth League on the 10th to express their support, and the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth has written to the Dutch government, protesting its crimes of imperialist aggression and persecution of Dutch democratic youth. The letters are as follows:
        (I) Letter from the World Federation of Democratic Youth to the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League:
Dear friends,

    Dutch youth have written to say that following the rising movement of the Dutch people and youth against the Dutch military's imperialist war in Indonesia, the Dutch government is carrying out severe persecution of youth, especially by forcibly transporting young soldiers to Indonesia, in violation of the country's constitution. Young soldiers imprisoned in the Songgawen and Nianweilus barracks, although opposed to being transported to Indonesia to fight, were finally forcibly transported to Indonesia.

    "We ask you to support this movement, to quickly notify youth groups to convey the above facts to members and young workers." This is the demand of Dutch youth in a letter to the Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which also says:

    "We believe that the countless protests raised by youth organizations in various countries will have a powerful effect, and the more factory youth workers participate in protests through rallies, the greater the effect."

    The Secretariat of the World Federation of Youth has already protested to Mr. Skergin, the Dutch Minister of Defense in The Hague. The World Federation of Youth believes that member groups in various countries will pay attention to the importance of the Dutch youth struggle; they are resisting Dutch imperialist oppression of the Indonesian people and youth, and fighting against them; the World Federation of Youth believes that youth organizations in various countries will immediately take necessary actions, and an international movement will strengthen the struggle to stop military intervention in the Indonesian people and youth and the persecution of Dutch youth who oppose this policy.

    Dear friends, please accept our brotherly greetings.
                        Bugara, General Secretary of the World Federation of Youth, November 21st

        (II) Letter from the China New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth to the Dutch Youth League:
Friends of the Dutch Youth League!

    From the letter from the Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, we know that you are waging a heroic struggle against the imperialist war being waged by the Dutch government in Indonesia, and we express our concern and respect, especially for those youth who have been imprisoned and sentenced to imprisonment for opposing the war of aggression, and for the soldiers who have been forcibly transported to Indonesia to wage war. We fully support your just actions and are inspired by your noble internationalist spirit. In addition to the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth writing a letter of protest to the Dutch government, demanding that they quickly stop the colonial war and the persecution of democratic youth, we will also publicize to Chinese youth how you support the struggle of colonial youth.

    We hope that you will persevere in the struggle until victory is achieved. In the struggle against imperialist war and for world peace, Chinese youth will always be your loyal comrades-in-arms. We believe that as long as we are closely united, our strength is unparalleled, and our common cause is bound to be victorious.
                            China New Democratic Youth League
                            Central Committee
                            All-China Federation of Democratic Youth
                            January 10, 1950

        (III) Protest Letter from the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth to the Dutch Government:
To the Dutch Government in The Hague, and forwarded to the Minister of Defense, Mr. Skergin:

    The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth expresses serious protest against your forcing young soldiers imprisoned in the Songgawen and Nianweilus barracks to be transported to Indonesia to carry out an imperialist war of aggression, and sentencing Dutch soldiers who refuse to be forcibly sent to Indonesia to fight.

    We, the democratic youth of China, condemn the colonial war waged by the Dutch government in Indonesia, oppose the suppression of the national liberation movement of the Indonesian people, and oppose sending troops and transporting weapons to massacre the Indonesian people and youth. We believe that your action of forcibly transporting troops to Indonesia to wage war violates the principle of national freedom, violates the interests of the Dutch people and youth, and violates the will of peace-loving and democratic youth around the world. We express our great indignation at this action and demand that it be stopped.

    We demand that you immediately stop the colonial war being waged in Indonesia, quickly restore the freedom of Dutch democratic youth who oppose the war of aggression, and revoke the shameful sentences imposed on Dutch youth who are unwilling to violate their own will to massacre the Indonesian people.
                                All-China Federation of Democratic Youth
                                January 10, 1950

    声援荷兰被迫害青年  谴责荷政府侵略印尼
    【新华社北京十一日电】世界民主青年联盟写信给中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会，呼吁中国青年声援荷兰青年反对荷兰政府在印度尼西亚进行帝国主义战争的斗争。中国新民主主义青年团已与中华全国民主青年联合总会于十日联名致函荷兰青年联盟表示支持，并由中华全国民主青年联合总会写信给荷兰政府，对其进行帝国主义侵略战争和对荷兰民主青年进行迫害的罪行提出抗议。各该信件如下：
            （一）世界民主青年联盟来信给中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会：亲爱的朋友们：
    荷兰青年来信说：继荷兰人民和青年反对荷军在印度尼西亚进行帝国主义战争的日益高涨运动后，荷政府对青年施行严厉的迫害，尤其是强迫运输青年士兵至印尼，违反了国家的宪法。监禁在松葛文和尼安维鲁斯兵营里的青年士兵虽然反对被运到印尼去作战，但终于被强制运输到印尼去了。
    “我们要求你们支持这个运动，迅速通知各青年团体将上述事实转达给会员和青年工人”。这是荷兰青年给世界民主青年联盟秘书处信上的要求，信上还说：
    “我们相信各国青年组织提出的无数抗议将得到有力的效果，以集会来抗议的工厂青年工人参加的人数愈多，则效果也愈大。”
    世界青联秘书处已经向海牙的荷国防部长斯哥金先生提出抗议，世界青联相信各国会员团体将注意荷兰青年斗争的重要性；他们反抗荷帝国主义压迫印尼人民与青年及对他们进行战争；世界青联相信各国青年组织将立即采取必要行动，一个国际性的运动将加强阻止对印尼人民和青年的军事干涉及迫害反对这种政策的荷兰青年的斗争。
    亲爱的朋友们，请接受我们兄弟般的敬礼。
                  布加拉世界青联总书记  十一月二十一日
            （二）中国新民主主义青年团和全国民主青联致荷兰青年联盟信荷兰青年联盟的朋友们！
    我们从世界民主青年联盟秘书处的来信里，知道你们为反对荷兰政府在印尼进行的帝国主义战争，正进行着英勇的斗争，特别是对那些为反对侵略战争而被监禁与判处徒刑的青年及被强迫运到印尼去进行战争的士兵，表示关怀与尊敬。我们完全支持你们的正义行动，并为你们崇高的国际主义精神所鼓舞。除已由中华全国民主青年联合总会写信向荷兰政府提出抗议，要求他们迅速停止殖民战争及对民主青年的迫害外，我们还要向中国青年宣传你们如何支援殖民地青年的斗争。
    希望你们坚持的战斗下去，直到取得胜利。在反对帝国主义战争、争取世界和平的斗争中，中国青年永远是你们忠实的战友。我们相信只要我们紧紧的团结在一起，我们的力量是无比强大的，我们的共同事业是一定要胜利的。
                            中国新民主主义青年团
                            中央委员会
                            中华全国民主青年联合总会
                            一九五○年一月十日
            （三）全国民主青联给荷兰政府抗议信海牙荷兰政府并转国防部长斯哥金先生：
    中华全国民主青年联合总会，对你们把监禁在松葛文和尼安维鲁斯兵营里的青年士兵强迫运到印尼去进行帝国主义侵略战争，并对拒绝被迫派赴印尼作战的荷兰士兵判处徒刑，表示严重的抗议。
    我们中国民主青年谴责荷兰政府在印尼进行的殖民战争，反对镇压印尼人民的民族解放运动，反对遣派军队与运输武器去屠杀印尼的人民与青年。我们认为你们强迫运输军队去印尼进行战争的行动，是违反民族自由的原则，违反荷兰人民与青年的利益，并违反全世界爱好和平民主青年的意志。对于这种行动，我们表示极大的愤慨，并要求制止这种行动。
    我们要求你们立刻停止在印尼所进行的殖民战争，迅速恢复反对进行侵略战争的荷兰民主青年的自由，取消对不愿违反自己的意志去屠杀印尼人民的荷兰青年的可耻判决。
                                   中华全国民主青年联合总会
                                           一九五○年一月十日
