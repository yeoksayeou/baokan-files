Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: TASS, London, 6th -- Britain's difficulties in Malaya are increasing daily, and progressive elements in Britain are demanding an end to Britain's armed intervention in Malaya. They emphasize the disasters the war has brought to the people of Britain and Malaya. The number of British deaths is gradually increasing, the burden of war taxes is becoming heavier, while monopoly capitalists are reaping huge profits from this slaughter.

Woodis, commenting on the situation in Malaya in the *Daily Worker*, wrote: "At the beginning of the war in Malaya, government spokesmen said that the war could be ended in two months. But eighteen months have passed, the casualty lists continue to grow, war costs are increasing, and official rhetoric is becoming increasingly disheartened. Now, the High Commissioner of the Federation of Malaya, Gurney, has announced that the Malayan government will mobilize all civilian resources for the war. This statement is not only a clear proof of the strength of the Malayan National Liberation Army, it also poses a sharp warning to the British people. In terms of money and British lives, the war has placed a terrible burden on the British people. For the young British soldiers who are sent to the jungles of Malaya to protect the profits of tin and rubber, this war is a disaster." Woodis pointed out that the government is gradually refusing to publish detailed and precise figures for Malayan war costs. He estimated that this expense is about 100 million pounds per year, and said that perhaps it is already 150 million pounds.

    侵略战争带来了死亡和重税
    英人民反对制造灾难
    要求结束武装干涉马来亚
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社伦敦六日讯：英国在马来亚的困难日形增加，英国的进步阶层要求结束英国在马来亚的武装干涉。他们着重指出战争给英国和马来亚人民带来的灾难，英国人死亡的数目正逐渐增加，战税的负担日益加重，而独占资本家却从这个屠杀当中获得巨额的利润。
    渥迪斯在工人日报上评论马来亚的形势时写道：在马来亚战争开始的时候，政府发言人说，这个战争在两个月内即可结束。但是，十八个月已经过去了，伤亡名单不断增加，战费日益增多，而官方的言论却日加沮丧。现在，马来亚联邦的高级专员格尔奈宣布，为了战争，马来亚政府将动员所有民间的资源。这一声明不仅是清楚地证明了马来亚民族解放军的力量。它也对英国人民提出了尖锐的警告。就金钱资源和英国人的生命来说，战争业已把可怕的负担加在英国人民的身上。对于被派到马来亚的丛林中去保护锡和橡胶的利润的英国青年士兵们，这个战争就是灾难。渥迪斯指出，政府逐渐拒绝发表马来亚战费的详细精确数字。他估计这笔费用每年约为一万万英镑，他说，或许已经是一万万五千万英镑了。
