    The Bountiful Yellow Sea
    By our reporter Chen Yongjin

    From the Yangtze River Estuary to the Yalu River Estuary
    Last month, at Qingdao's small harbor, I visited the "Huamin" fishing boat, which had returned fully loaded from beyond the Yalu River Estuary. The old fisherman Xue Futing told me about the abundant fish production in the Yellow Sea: from the Yangtze River Estuary to the Yalu River Estuary, over three thousand miles of the Yellow Sea, this is China's most abundant fishing area. The fishing zone covers nearly ten thousand square li, and its fish production accounts for one-third of the country's total. The Yellow Sea has four major fishing grounds distributed in the outer Yalu River Estuary, the eastern end of the Shandong Peninsula, outside Lianyungang, and east of the Yangtze River Estuary. Among them, the Shidao fishing ground on the eastern Shandong Peninsula produces the most fish and is one of China's best fishing ports. The cold and warm currents of the western Pacific meet here, and both northern and southern fish populations pass through this area.

    During the spring fishing season, fish migrate north from the Zhoushan Islands to spawn in the Bohai Bay; after the autumn fishing season, they migrate south. From Grain Rain to the Beginning of Summer, it is the "small sea market" and "big sea market" for Yellow Sea fishermen. Just like the wheat harvest and autumn harvest for farmers, it is the busiest season for fishermen. The types of fish in the Yellow Sea are so numerous that even fishermen who have spent their entire lives fishing cannot name them all. In Qingdao's aquarium, I only saw over four hundred species, just the most unusual types; but the most common are yellow croaker, ribbonfish, sea bream, sharks, white pomfret, whales, sea shrimp, and a dozen other species. Experienced fishermen catch various fish and shrimp according to the season and the ebb and flow of the tides.

    When sailing on the vast Yellow Sea, you will encounter dense schools of fish. Clumsy whales, with bodies as large as large tile-roofed houses. During the "big sea market," yellow croaker make chirping noises on the seabed, giving fishermen a signal to cast their nets. At Chengshantou or Changshan Island, almost every island edge in the Yellow Sea has groups of seals lying and crawling. Hairless porpoises like to follow behind ships. Sea jellies floating in the bays like pot lids or millstones can be easily caught on board. This spring, a pair of fishing boats caught ten thousand catties of large shrimp over half a foot long in a single day. Sea lions and seals also sometimes appear on the sea surface to be captured by fishermen. At low tide near the sea, countless young women and children catch clams and pick seaweed. Currently, the Shidao fishing ground has the most cod.

    The edges of the Yellow Sea are suitable for cultivating kelp, wakame (seaweed), agar, sea cucumbers, clams, etc. The Shandong coast alone has one million mu suitable for cultivation. Each mu can yield an income equivalent to two thousand catties of grain per year, totaling two hundred million catties. This is an important side business for coastal fishermen. Yantai, Dashidao, Weihaiwei, Liugong Island, and other places have already cultivated forty thousand seedlings, which can produce forty thousand catties next year.

    The Tragic Songs of History Have Passed
    In Qingdao's fish market, manager Wang Yuguang told many tragic stories of fishermen in history: "Heads exposed to dew, feet treading frost, a year of hard work ends up with nothing," "Other people's children learn to read, my children learn to fish; other people's children sit in high office, my children peddle fish and salt, good land in the west depression is not mine, a family of eight eats on a fishing boat; others till the land, I till the sea, the fish I catch leaves no money." This is a depiction of the historical life of Yellow Sea fishermen. During the rule of Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, the lives of fishermen became even more difficult.

    After the Japanese invaders occupied the Yellow Sea, the sea surface was blocked by airplanes and warships, which bombed and strafed fishing boats. During the Anti-Japanese War, more than five thousand fishing boats and more than forty-eight thousand nets were lost. Japanese devils often used fishing boats as aiming points to test their shooting skills. The Kuomintang army had even more methods of ruling and plundering fishermen. In Qingdao's small harbor alone, there were seven units with the names of the Youth Army, Navy, Water Police, and Military Police to conduct so-called "inspections." At that time, the Kuomintang army in Qingdao was most interested in setting up posts in the small harbor. Every fisherman being "inspected" had to give the best fish to the inspecting Kuomintang soldiers to pass safely; otherwise, they would be detained in the police station.

    What the Yellow Sea fishermen hated were also usurious loans and fish merchants, whose exploitation of fishermen was unimaginable. Before the "big sea market," fishermen were forced to borrow money from usurious lenders and fish merchants. They had to sell the fish they caught to them, who bought the fishermen's fish with scales of twenty, thirty, or even forty taels, and then sold it with smaller scales. The interest paid by fishermen on loans reached as high as fifteen to twenty-three percent. Almost every family on Changshan Island had debts, ranging from two taels of gold to as much as twenty taels. No matter how much fish the fishermen caught, they could not withstand their ever-increasing exploitation. A fisherman named LÃ¼ Dachang in Yantai caught 100,000 catties of fish in a year, but when he settled accounts with the fish merchant, he only had twenty-five catties left. The fishermen's houses, land, and fishing gear were mostly mortgaged. Twenty to fifty percent of the houses, land, and fishing gear of the island's fishermen were mortgaged to usurers.

    According to Yin Zhongxian, a fisherman from Jinghai District, Wendeng County, he had no foothold before the establishment of the democratic government. Now he has fifteen shrimp nets, a boat, and has bought eight mu of land and eleven houses. The historically tragic life of fishermen in the liberated areas has passed with the liberation of the people. Houses, land, and fishing gear have been recovered in the rent reduction and interest reduction settlement.

    Heroic Spirit
    The fishermen of the Yellow Sea have developed a natural heroic character in their struggle with the sea's natural forces. Regardless of blizzards or bad weather, they sail small sailboats far out to sea amidst raging waves, fishing and catching shrimp, often for several days and nights away from the coast, and they never show fear.

    "War educates the people, and the people win the war." Among the fishermen of the Yellow Sea, you will more deeply experience Chairman Mao's famous saying. Having suffered the ravages of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang for more than a decade, the actual lessons have made them understand that only with resolute and tenacious struggle can they liberate themselves. The fishermen of the Yellow Sea have been engaged in heroic struggles against the enemy for more than a decade. In the eastern part of the Shandong Peninsula, I visited many fishermen, who told many heroic epics of struggle. In Shidao, an old fisherman (now the vice director of the promotion cooperative) Wang Yuji told me: Most of the fishermen in this area have joined the militia, deploying defenses and laying mines on the coast of their hometown. When they go out to fish, some carry guns and hand grenades in preparation for fighting the enemy. Sometimes they also strike into the enemy's camp to make enemy ships revolt, or tie Japanese devils and Kuomintang soldiers to the masts of their boats in the sea and return victoriously. In recent years, more than fifteen steamships have been captured by them or revolted under their encouragement. Fishermen are the best eyes and ears of the People's Liberation Army along the coast during the war. They have a grasp of the enemy's situation hundreds of miles from the coast. Last spring, a large ship from Tianjin to Shanghai carrying more than two hundred Kuomintang military officers was captured by the coastal defense team and fishermen. On Moye Island, ten miles from the Shandong Peninsula, similar immortal achievements of struggle have been written; last year, two large Kuomintang warships attacked Moye Island, firing more than four thousand shells, but the fishermen never retreated a step. In 1945, eighteen fishermen from Mo Island crossed the sea to harass the enemy at Shidao, their boat was overturned, and they swam in the waves back to their own positions.

    The fishermen in the old liberated areas along the Yellow Sea coast have a high degree of political awareness. Many young men and women have left the fishermen's life for their own liberation. Some have brothers or sisters, two or three of them, all joining the People's Liberation Army. In Dazinzhuang, Haiyang County, which has more than a thousand fishermen, more than two hundred young people have joined the Liberation Army. In the Thirteenth District of Rushan County, there are now two companies of honorary soldiers. During the support for the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign, three special-class heroes emerged from Yuankua Village, Wendeng County alone. In the recent support for the southern sea battle, fishermen also eagerly signed up to participate. On October 24th, in Shidao and Moye Island, I saw the enthusiastic scene of fishermen participating in the war. The superiors asked for thirty people, but three hundred people signed up, two-thirds of whom were Communist Party members. They felt that supporting the front line was their greatest glory.

    Harvest
    Under the leadership and support of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and inspired by the victory of the revolution, the fishermen of the Yellow Sea responded to Chairman Mao's call to increase production by an inch and achieved a harvest unseen in more than a decade.

    Last year, the leading organs in various coastal areas put forward the slogans: "Don't idle a single net, don't idle a single boat," "Cast one more net, catch one more net of fish," organized fishermen's mutual aid, and began to freely fish in their own vast and bountiful sea. According to incomplete statistics from fourteen counties in Jiaodong, there were 5,013 fishing boats at sea, and 85,128 nets of various types, accounting for 99% of the original amount, and some places reached full departure. According to statistics from thirteen counties, last year the number of boats increased by 3.7% and the number of nets increased by 17%. The Donghai Special Zone alone increased by 6,581 nets. This is inseparable from the help of the People's Government. The Jiaodong government organs issued a large amount of fishing loans, lending 1.68 million catties of grain and 18 million yuan last spring. The fishing broke the past purely seasonal saying of going to sea. Last year, they went to sea half a month earlier. In Shandong, last year, 130 million catties of fish were obtained. The Jiaodong area generally increased production by 20%. The Haiyang and Rushan areas increased by an average of 50% compared to last year. Last year, Lianyungang achieved a harvest unseen in eighteen years, with a two-thirds increase compared to before liberation. Three hundred and fifty-nine shrimp nets in Lian Island Township caught more than 137,000 catties of shrimp in nine days. They said: "Without overthrowing the reactionaries, there would be no such years."

    Most fishermen, under the education of the Communist Party, have broken the habit of not fishing in winter and mostly go to sea to fish and catch shrimp. More than seventy fishermen families on Longxu Island catch 70,000 catties of small white shrimp every day. In previous years, the fish market in winter was mostly dried fish, but this year it is very different. Various fresh fish are displayed in various fish markets. Last year, the average income of Yellow Sea fishermen was more than 600 catties per person per season, with the most reaching 4,000 catties. Fishermen in Yantai are now depositing large amounts of money in the People's Bank. The People's Bank received 21.55 million yuan in fishermen's deposits in just one month. The fishermen of Moye Island said in their production report to Chairman Mao: "Last year we produced 2.5 million catties of fish and shrimp (equivalent to 2 million catties of grain). This winter we all went to sea and produced 200,000 catties of grain, laying the foundation for large-scale production next year." The livelihood problems of the people of Mo Island can be completely solved. They thank Chairman Mao for his leadership. The fishermen said, "Without Chairman Mao's leadership, we would have ceased to exist long ago." They warmly sent gifts such as shark fins, dried scallops, and dried shrimp to Beijing, and their words are completely true. These liberated people conclude that all victories and harvests come from the leadership of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and Chairman Mao.

    Fishermen's Home
    Most towns and villages along the Yellow Sea have their own supply and marketing cooperatives or public promotion cooperatives. From Lianyungang to Yantai, the vast majority of fishermen have been organized around supply and marketing cooperatives.

    Comrade Yu Tian, director of the Shidao Fishery Promotion Cooperative, told me that the Shidao Promotion Cooperative (including Wendeng, Rongcheng, and Shidao) has more than forty fishery supply and marketing cooperatives, with nearly 70,000 members. All the daily necessities and means of production needed by fishermen are obtained from the supply and marketing cooperative. The fish and shrimp they catch are sent to the supply and marketing cooperative for sale. Many women's net-making groups and supply and marketing cooperatives are organized on coastal islands and villages. They use fish to exchange for all daily necessities in large cities, and also exchange for all the food and means of production they need. Fishermen call the supply and marketing cooperative "their own home." This year, the Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Yexian fishery cooperatives supplied fishermen with 429,369 catties of grain and 579 bags of flour during the big sea market, and also preserved 5,195,800 catties of fish for fishermen. Qunsheng Cooperative alone sold 13,562,895 catties of fish and supplied fishermen with more than 20,000 catties of tung oil, 2,800 catties of linen, and 20 bundles of cotton yarn. This is just the supply figure for one area.

    Fishermen no longer have any fears about food and means of production. Although prices have been rising continuously last year, the fishermen's feeling seems to be very small. Because the price of fish and the price of grain have always maintained a balance: one catty of fish is equivalent to more than one catty of grain. The fishermen said: "Without the supply and marketing cooperative, we don't know what kind of life we would have this year!"

    In the supply and marketing cooperatives I visited, the situation was the same. When fishermen go out to sea to fish in the morning, they also go to the cooperative to take a look. When they come back from fishing in the sea, they do not return to their homes first, but go to the supply and marketing cooperative to rest before going home. Some people eat their meals while holding their bowls in the cooperative. Most fishery cooperatives can play a significant role in organizing productive forces.
