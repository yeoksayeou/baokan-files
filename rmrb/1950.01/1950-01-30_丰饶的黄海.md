    The Bountiful Yellow Sea
    By our reporter Chen Yongjin

    From the Yangtze River Estuary to the Yalu River Estuary
    Last month, at Qingdao's small harbor, I visited the "Huamin" fishing boat, which had returned fully loaded from beyond the Yalu River Estuary. The old fisherman Xue Futing told me about the abundant fish production in the Yellow Sea: from the Yangtze River Estuary to the Yalu River Estuary, over three thousand miles of the Yellow Sea, this is China's most abundant fishing area. The fishing zone covers nearly ten thousand square li, and its fish production accounts for one-third of the country's total. The Yellow Sea has four major fishing grounds distributed in the outer Yalu River Estuary, the eastern end of the Shandong Peninsula, outside Lianyungang, and east of the Yangtze River Estuary. Among them, the Shidao fishing ground on the eastern Shandong Peninsula produces the most fish and is one of China's best fishing ports. The cold and warm currents of the western Pacific meet here, and both northern and southern fish populations pass through this area.

    During the spring fishing season, fish migrate north from the Zhoushan Islands to spawn in the Bohai Bay; after the autumn fishing season, they migrate south. From Grain Rain to the Beginning of Summer, it is the "small sea market" and "big sea market" for Yellow Sea fishermen. Just like the wheat harvest and autumn harvest for farmers, it is the busiest season for fishermen. The types of fish in the Yellow Sea are so numerous that even fishermen who have spent their entire lives fishing cannot name them all. In Qingdao's aquarium, I only saw over four hundred species, just the most unusual types; but the most common are yellow croaker, ribbonfish, sea bream, sharks, white pomfret, whales, sea shrimp, and a dozen other species. Experienced fishermen catch various fish and shrimp according to the season and the ebb and flow of the tides.

    When sailing on the vast Yellow Sea, you will encounter dense schools of fish. Clumsy whales, with bodies as large as large tile-roofed houses. During the "big sea market," yellow croaker make chirping noises on the seabed, giving fishermen a signal to cast their nets. At Chengshantou or Changshan Island, almost every island edge in the Yellow Sea has groups of seals lying and crawling. Hairless porpoises like to follow behind ships. Sea jellies floating in the bays like pot lids or millstones can be easily caught on board. This spring, a pair of fishing boats caught ten thousand catties of large shrimp over half a foot long in a single day. Sea lions and seals also sometimes appear on the sea surface to be captured by fishermen. At low tide near the sea, countless young women and children catch clams and pick seaweed. Currently, the Shidao fishing ground has the most cod.

    The edges of the Yellow Sea are suitable for cultivating kelp, wakame (seaweed), agar, sea cucumbers, clams, etc. The Shandong coast alone has one million mu suitable for cultivation. Each mu can yield an income equivalent to two thousand catties of grain per year, totaling two hundred million catties. This is an important side business for coastal fishermen. Yantai, Dashidao, Weihaiwei, Liugong Island, and other places have already cultivated forty thousand seedlings, which can produce forty thousand catties next year.

    The Tragic Songs of History Have Passed
    In Qingdao's fish market, manager Wang Yuguang told many tragic stories of fishermen in history: "Heads exposed to dew, feet treading frost, a year of hard work ends up with nothing," "Other people's children learn to read, my children learn to fish; other people's children sit in high office, my children peddle fish and salt, good land in the west depression is not mine, a family of eight eats on a fishing boat; others till the land, I till the sea, the fish I catch leaves no money." This is a depiction of the historical life of Yellow Sea fishermen. During the rule of Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, the lives of fishermen became even more difficult.

    After the Japanese invaders occupied the Yellow Sea, the sea surface was blocked by airplanes and warships, which bombed and strafed fishing boats. During the Anti-Japanese War, more than five thousand fishing boats and more than forty-eight thousand nets were lost. Japanese devils often used fishing boats as aiming points to test their shooting skills. The Kuomintang army had even more methods of ruling and plundering fishermen. In Qingdao's small harbor alone, there were seven units with the names of the Youth Army, Navy, Water Police, and Military Police to conduct so-called "inspections." At that time, the Kuomintang army in Qingdao was most interested in setting up posts in the small harbor. Every fisherman being "inspected" had to give the best fish to the inspecting Kuomintang soldiers to pass safely; otherwise, they would be detained in the police station.

    What the Yellow Sea fishermen hated were also usurious loans and fish merchants, whose exploitation of fishermen was unimaginable. Before the "big sea market," fishermen were forced to borrow money from usurious lenders and fish merchants. They had to sell the fish they caught to them, who bought the fishermen's fish with scales of twenty, thirty, or even forty taels, and then sold it with smaller scales. The interest paid by fishermen on loans reached as high as fifteen to twenty-three percent. Almost every family on Changshan Island had debts, ranging from two taels of gold to as much as twenty taels. No matter how much fish the fishermen caught, they could not withstand their ever-increasing exploitation. A fisherman named Lü Dachang in Yantai caught 100,000 catties of fish in a year, but when he settled accounts with the fish merchant, he only had twenty-five catties left. The fishermen's houses, land, and fishing gear were mostly mortgaged. Twenty to fifty percent of the houses, land, and fishing gear of the island's fishermen were mortgaged to usurers.

    According to Yin Zhongxian, a fisherman from Jinghai District, Wendeng County, he had no foothold before the establishment of the democratic government. Now he has fifteen shrimp nets, a boat, and has bought eight mu of land and eleven houses. The historically tragic life of fishermen in the liberated areas has passed with the liberation of the people. Houses, land, and fishing gear have been recovered in the rent reduction and interest reduction settlement.

    Heroic Spirit
    The fishermen of the Yellow Sea have developed a natural heroic character in their struggle with the sea's natural forces. Regardless of blizzards or bad weather, they sail small sailboats far out to sea amidst raging waves, fishing and catching shrimp, often for several days and nights away from the coast, and they never show fear.

    "War educates the people, and the people win the war." Among the fishermen of the Yellow Sea, you will more deeply experience Chairman Mao's famous saying. Having suffered the ravages of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang for more than a decade, the actual lessons have made them understand that only with resolute and tenacious struggle can they liberate themselves. The fishermen of the Yellow Sea have been engaged in heroic struggles against the enemy for more than a decade. In the eastern part of the Shandong Peninsula, I visited many fishermen, who told many heroic epics of struggle. In Shidao, an old fisherman (now the vice director of the promotion cooperative) Wang Yuji told me: Most of the fishermen in this area have joined the militia, deploying defenses and laying mines on the coast of their hometown. When they go out to fish, some carry guns and hand grenades in preparation for fighting the enemy. Sometimes they also strike into the enemy's camp to make enemy ships revolt, or tie Japanese devils and Kuomintang soldiers to the masts of their boats in the sea and return victoriously. In recent years, more than fifteen steamships have been captured by them or revolted under their encouragement. Fishermen are the best eyes and ears of the People's Liberation Army along the coast during the war. They have a grasp of the enemy's situation hundreds of miles from the coast. Last spring, a large ship from Tianjin to Shanghai carrying more than two hundred Kuomintang military officers was captured by the coastal defense team and fishermen. On Moye Island, ten miles from the Shandong Peninsula, similar immortal achievements of struggle have been written; last year, two large Kuomintang warships attacked Moye Island, firing more than four thousand shells, but the fishermen never retreated a step. In 1945, eighteen fishermen from Mo Island crossed the sea to harass the enemy at Shidao, their boat was overturned, and they swam in the waves back to their own positions.

    The fishermen in the old liberated areas along the Yellow Sea coast have a high degree of political awareness. Many young men and women have left the fishermen's life for their own liberation. Some have brothers or sisters, two or three of them, all joining the People's Liberation Army. In Dazinzhuang, Haiyang County, which has more than a thousand fishermen, more than two hundred young people have joined the Liberation Army. In the Thirteenth District of Rushan County, there are now two companies of honorary soldiers. During the support for the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign, three special-class heroes emerged from Yuankua Village, Wendeng County alone. In the recent support for the southern sea battle, fishermen also eagerly signed up to participate. On October 24th, in Shidao and Moye Island, I saw the enthusiastic scene of fishermen participating in the war. The superiors asked for thirty people, but three hundred people signed up, two-thirds of whom were Communist Party members. They felt that supporting the front line was their greatest glory.

    Harvest
    Under the leadership and support of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and inspired by the victory of the revolution, the fishermen of the Yellow Sea responded to Chairman Mao's call to increase production by an inch and achieved a harvest unseen in more than a decade.

    Last year, the leading organs in various coastal areas put forward the slogans: "Don't idle a single net, don't idle a single boat," "Cast one more net, catch one more net of fish," organized fishermen's mutual aid, and began to freely fish in their own vast and bountiful sea. According to incomplete statistics from fourteen counties in Jiaodong, there were 5,013 fishing boats at sea, and 85,128 nets of various types, accounting for 99% of the original amount, and some places reached full departure. According to statistics from thirteen counties, last year the number of boats increased by 3.7% and the number of nets increased by 17%. The Donghai Special Zone alone increased by 6,581 nets. This is inseparable from the help of the People's Government. The Jiaodong government organs issued a large amount of fishing loans, lending 1.68 million catties of grain and 18 million yuan last spring. The fishing broke the past purely seasonal saying of going to sea. Last year, they went to sea half a month earlier. In Shandong, last year, 130 million catties of fish were obtained. The Jiaodong area generally increased production by 20%. The Haiyang and Rushan areas increased by an average of 50% compared to last year. Last year, Lianyungang achieved a harvest unseen in eighteen years, with a two-thirds increase compared to before liberation. Three hundred and fifty-nine shrimp nets in Lian Island Township caught more than 137,000 catties of shrimp in nine days. They said: "Without overthrowing the reactionaries, there would be no such years."

    Most fishermen, under the education of the Communist Party, have broken the habit of not fishing in winter and mostly go to sea to fish and catch shrimp. More than seventy fishermen families on Longxu Island catch 70,000 catties of small white shrimp every day. In previous years, the fish market in winter was mostly dried fish, but this year it is very different. Various fresh fish are displayed in various fish markets. Last year, the average income of Yellow Sea fishermen was more than 600 catties per person per season, with the most reaching 4,000 catties. Fishermen in Yantai are now depositing large amounts of money in the People's Bank. The People's Bank received 21.55 million yuan in fishermen's deposits in just one month. The fishermen of Moye Island said in their production report to Chairman Mao: "Last year we produced 2.5 million catties of fish and shrimp (equivalent to 2 million catties of grain). This winter we all went to sea and produced 200,000 catties of grain, laying the foundation for large-scale production next year." The livelihood problems of the people of Mo Island can be completely solved. They thank Chairman Mao for his leadership. The fishermen said, "Without Chairman Mao's leadership, we would have ceased to exist long ago." They warmly sent gifts such as shark fins, dried scallops, and dried shrimp to Beijing, and their words are completely true. These liberated people conclude that all victories and harvests come from the leadership of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and Chairman Mao.

    Fishermen's Home
    Most towns and villages along the Yellow Sea have their own supply and marketing cooperatives or public promotion cooperatives. From Lianyungang to Yantai, the vast majority of fishermen have been organized around supply and marketing cooperatives.

    Comrade Yu Tian, director of the Shidao Fishery Promotion Cooperative, told me that the Shidao Promotion Cooperative (including Wendeng, Rongcheng, and Shidao) has more than forty fishery supply and marketing cooperatives, with nearly 70,000 members. All the daily necessities and means of production needed by fishermen are obtained from the supply and marketing cooperative. The fish and shrimp they catch are sent to the supply and marketing cooperative for sale. Many women's net-making groups and supply and marketing cooperatives are organized on coastal islands and villages. They use fish to exchange for all daily necessities in large cities, and also exchange for all the food and means of production they need. Fishermen call the supply and marketing cooperative "their own home." This year, the Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Yexian fishery cooperatives supplied fishermen with 429,369 catties of grain and 579 bags of flour during the big sea market, and also preserved 5,195,800 catties of fish for fishermen. Qunsheng Cooperative alone sold 13,562,895 catties of fish and supplied fishermen with more than 20,000 catties of tung oil, 2,800 catties of linen, and 20 bundles of cotton yarn. This is just the supply figure for one area.

    Fishermen no longer have any fears about food and means of production. Although prices have been rising continuously last year, the fishermen's feeling seems to be very small. Because the price of fish and the price of grain have always maintained a balance: one catty of fish is equivalent to more than one catty of grain. The fishermen said: "Without the supply and marketing cooperative, we don't know what kind of life we would have this year!"

    In the supply and marketing cooperatives I visited, the situation was the same. When fishermen go out to sea to fish in the morning, they also go to the cooperative to take a look. When they come back from fishing in the sea, they do not return to their homes first, but go to the supply and marketing cooperative to rest before going home. Some people eat their meals while holding their bowls in the cooperative. Most fishery cooperatives can play a significant role in organizing productive forces.

    丰饶的黄海
    本报记者  陈勇进
    从长江口到鸭绿江口
    上月中旬，记者在青岛的小港中访问了自鸭绿江口外满载归来的“华民”号渔轮，老捕鱼家薛福亭告诉了我丰饶的黄海的鱼产情形：从长江口到鸭绿江口，三千余里的黄海，这就是中国鱼产最丰富的地方。产鱼区近十万方里，产鱼量占全国三分之一。黄海南北有四大鱼场分布在鸭绿江口外、山东半岛的东端、连云港外、及长江口的东面。其中以山东半岛东的石岛鱼场产鱼最多，是中国最好的鱼港之一，西太平洋寒暖流在此会合，南北鱼群均经过这里。
    春汛时，鱼群自舟山群岛北游，至渤海湾产卵；秋汛后鱼群南去。从谷雨到立夏，这是黄海渔民的“小海市”与“大海市”。正如农民的麦收秋收一样，是渔民最忙的季节。黄海中鱼的种类，就是打一辈子鱼的渔民也不能叫得清。我在青岛的水族馆里，也只能看到四百多种，只是最奇怪的鱼类；但最普通的是黄花、带、加吉、鲨、白麟、鲸、海虾等十余种。富有经验的渔民是按着季节及海潮的涨落来捕各种鱼虾的。
    在广阔的黄海海面航行时，会使你碰到密集的鱼群。笨重的鲸鱼，身体庞大得像大瓦屋一样。“大海市”时，黄花鱼在海底叫出唧哇的声音，这就给渔民一种下网的信号。在成山头或长山岛，几乎是黄海中每个岛边都有成群的海狗在卧爬。没毛的海猪喜欢跟在船的后面行进。海湾里起浮着像锅盖或磨顶样的海豆腐（海蜇），信手都可把它捉到船上来。半尺多长的大虾，今春一对渔轮一天可捉到一万斤。海狮子、海豹，有时也出现在海面上为渔民俘获。落潮时在海的近边，无数年轻的妇女及孩子们捉蛤蚌拾海菜。现在，石岛渔场上正是鳕鱼最多的时候。
    黄海的近边适于养殖昆布、若布（即海带）、石花菜、海参、蛤蚌等，仅山东沿海即有一百万亩可以养殖。每亩每年按两千斤粮折合，可收入两万万斤。这是沿海渔民的重要副业。烟台、大石岛、威海卫、刘公岛等地已养成苗四十万棵，明年可产四十万斤。
    历史的悲曲过去了
    在青岛的渔市场上，经理王玉光先生告诉了很多首历史上渔民的悲曲：“头顶露，脚踏霜，一年闹个光打光”，“人家的孩儿学读书，我家孩儿学打鱼；人家孩儿坐高官，我家的孩儿贩鱼盐，西洼好地非我有，一家八口吃渔船；人家耕田我耕海，捕来鱼儿不剩钱。”这就是黄海渔民历史生活的写照。在日寇及国民党统治时代，渔民的生活就更加困难了。
    日寇侵占黄海后，海面为飞机、军舰封锁着，见了渔船就轰炸扫射，在抗战中损失渔船五千余只，网四万八千余扣。日本鬼子往往拿着渔船当瞄准点来试验他们射击的技术。国民党军队对渔民的统治掠夺，方法就更多一些。仅在青岛的小港就有青年军、海军、水上警察、宪兵等七个番号来作所谓“检查”。当时青岛的国民党军队对小港设岗是最感到兴趣的。每个被“检查”的渔民必须拿最好的鱼给检查的国民党军，才能安稳的过关；否则就要被拘留在警察局去。
    使黄海渔民痛恨的，还有高利贷、渔行，他们对渔民的剥削是令人难以想得到的。渔民在“大海市”前，被迫要向高利贷、渔行借钱，打出鱼来还要卖给他们，他们用二十两，三十两甚至四十两的大秤将渔民的鱼买去，然后用小秤出卖。渔民借债所付利息，有高达十五分到二十三分的利息。长山岛的渔民几乎每家都有借债，少的是二两金子，多者到二十两。渔民打鱼再多也受不住他们利滚利的掠夺。烟台的一个渔民吕大昌一年打鱼十万斤，等到给渔行算账时却只剩了二十五斤。渔民的房子、土地、渔具多数被押去了。该岛渔民百分之二十到五十的房子、土地、渔具被押在高利贷者的手里。
    文登县靖海区的渔民尹忠贤来说，他在民主政府建立前无立足之地。现在已有十五扣鱼虾网，一只船，并买地八亩、房子十一间。已解放地区渔民历史上悲惨的生活已经随着人民的解放过去了，房子、土地、渔具在减租减息清算中收回来了。
    英雄的气概
    黄海的渔民，在与海的自然斗争中，养成了他们天然的英雄性格。不管是在大风雪或恶天气，在惊涛骇浪中驾着小帆船飘在海的远方，打鱼捉虾离开海岸常常几昼夜，他们从未表示畏惧。
    “战争教育了人民，人民又赢得了战争。”在黄海的渔民中，会更加深刻地使你体验到毛主席的这句名言。十几年来受尽了日寇与国民党的蹂躏，实际的教训使他们懂得了，只有用坚决顽强的斗争，才能解放自己。黄海的渔民这十几年来一直向敌人作着英勇地斗争。在山东半岛的东部，我访问了不少的渔民，他们谈出许多英勇地斗争史诗。在石岛，一个老渔民（现在是推进社副主任）王玉吉告诉我：这个地方的渔民大多数参加了民兵，在自己的家乡海岸布防埋雷。出发打鱼时有的拿着枪，带着手榴弹准备与敌人作战。他们有时也打进敌人的阵营使敌船起义，或者在大海中将日本鬼子、国民党兵绑在船桅上胜利归来。这些年来有十五只以上的汽轮被他们俘虏或者在他们的鼓动下起义了。渔民在战争中是沿海人民解放军最好的耳目。他们掌握着距海岸数百里的敌情。去春，从天津开往上海的一只大轮船满载国民党军校尉官二百余名做了海防队及渔民的俘虏。在离山东半岛十里许的镆耶岛上，同样写下了不灭的斗争业绩；去年国民党两只大兵舰，向镆耶岛进攻，足足打了四千余发炮弹，但渔民始终没退后一步。一九四五年，镆岛十八个渔民跨海出扰石岛的敌人，船被打翻了，他们在海浪中游泳，回到自己的阵地。
    在黄海沿岸的老解放区渔民，他们有高度的政治觉悟。青年男女很多是为自己的解放而离开了渔民生活。有的是弟兄或姐妹两三个全部参加了人民解放军，在海阳县一千多渔民的大辛庄，有二百多青年参加了解放军，乳山县十三区现在有两个连队的荣誉军人。支援渡江作战中，仅文登县院夼村就出现了三名特等功臣。在最近支援南方海战中，渔民亦争先的报名参加十月二十四号在石岛、镆耶岛，我看到渔民参战的热烈场面。上级叫去三十个人，结果报名者有三百人，其中三分之二是共产党员。他们感到支援前线是自己最大的光荣。
    丰收
    黄海的渔民在共产党与人民政府的领导与扶持下，在革命胜利的鼓舞中，响应了毛主席生产长一寸的号召，得到十余年来未有的丰收。
    去年沿海各地领导机关提出了：“不闲一扣网，不闲一只船”，“多下一扣网，多打一网鱼”的口号，组织了渔民互助，开始在自己的广阔丰饶的大海中自由的捕鱼。据胶东十四县不完全的统计，下海鱼船有五○一三只，各种鱼网八五一二八扣，占原有的百分之九十九，有的地方达到了完全出海。据十三个县统计，去年增加船百分之三·七，网增加百分之十七，仅东海专区即增加鱼网六五八一扣。这与人民政府的帮助是分不开的。胶东政府机关部门发行了大量的鱼贷，去春贷粮一六八万斤，款一八○○万元。捕鱼中打破了过去下海的纯季节的说法，去年早下海半月。在山东去年可获鱼一万万三千万斤，胶东区一般是增产百分之二十，海阳、乳山一带平均增产比去年增加百分之五十，去年连云港达到了十八年来未有的丰收，比解放前增产三分之二。连岛乡三五九扣虾网九天即捕虾十三万七千余斤。他们说：“不打垮反动派那里有这样的年月”。
    大多数渔民在共产党的教育下，已打破了不捕冬的习惯，大部下海捕鱼捉虾。龙须岛七十多家渔民每天打小白虾七万斤，往年冬天的鱼市场上多是干鱼，今年就大不同了，在各个鱼市场上摆满了各种鲜鱼。去年黄海渔民的收入平均每人每季是六百斤以上最多的到四千斤。烟台的渔民，现在正大量的向人民银行存款，人民银行仅一个月份即收到渔民存款二千一百五十五万元。镆耶岛的渔民在给毛主席的生产报告上说：“去年我们生产鱼虾二百五十万斤（折合粮二百万斤），冬季我们全部下海，已生产了二十万斤粮食，打下了明年大生产的基础。”镆岛人民的生活问题是可以完全解决的。他们感谢毛主席对他们的领导。渔民说：“没有毛主席的领导就早已没有我们了。”他们热情的将鱼翅、乾贝海米等礼物送往北京去，他们的话是完全真实的。这些翻身的人们将一切胜利地收获，都从共产党人民政府与毛主席的领导中得出结论。
    渔民之家
    沿黄海的每个城镇与乡村，大多数都有自己的供销社或公营推进社。从连云港到烟台，绝大多数的渔民已组织在供销社的周围。
    石岛渔业推进社主任于田同志告诉我，石岛推进社（包括文登、荣城、石岛）即有四十余个渔业供销社，有社员近七万人。渔民所需用的一切生活资料及生产资料都取之于供销社。他们打出的鱼虾送到供销社去销售，沿海的岛上及村庄，组织了很多妇女结网组、供销社，他们用鱼到大城市换来一切的日用必需品，并换取他们需要的一切食粮及生产资料。渔民称供销社为“自己的家”。今年烟台、威海卫、掖县三处渔业社在大海市期间即供给渔民粮食四二九三六九斤，面粉五七九袋，并给渔民腌鱼五一九五八○○斤，群生社一个社即推销鱼一三五六二八九五斤。并供应渔民桐油两万余斤，线麻两千八百斤，棉纱二十捆，这仅是一个地区供销的数字。
    渔民现在已经没有食粮及生产资料的恐慌。去年虽然物价不断的上涨，但渔民的感觉似乎是很小的。因为鱼价与粮价始终保持平衡：一斤鱼折合一斤多粮。渔民们说：“没有供销社我们今年不知要过什么生活哩！”
    在我所访问的供销社中，情形都是一样的，早晨出海打鱼时，渔民也跑到社里看一看，从海里打鱼回来的时候，他们并不先回到自己的家里而是先到供销社里休息一番才回家去。有些人吃着饭也端着碗在社里吃。多数的渔业社都能起到组织生产力的重大作用。
