Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 2nd: TASS Moscow - Pravda published an editorial on New Year's Eve, 1949, titled "A Year of Glorious Victory," providing a concise summary of the brilliant victories achieved by the Soviet Union in its communist construction and by the world's peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp in 1949.

The editorial stated: 1949 added a glorious page to the heroic struggle of our people for the victory of the great communist cause. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the brilliant guidance of Comrade Stalin, the Soviet people won outstanding labor achievements for the happiness of their beloved country. In 1949, the struggle to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule achieved remarkable success. In 1949, the total output of Soviet industry exceeded that of 1940 by more than forty percent. Socialist agriculture is making steady progress. Based on the achievements made in industry and agriculture, the material and cultural well-being of our working people is steadily improving. The great achievements of the Soviet people in communist construction demonstrate the benefits of the socialist system and its unparalleled superiority over the thoroughly corrupt capitalist system.

1949 was a year in which the powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism won further remarkable achievements. At the same time, 1949 brought further failures to the imperialist reactionary camp, the camp of warmongers, and further deepened all the contradictions among imperialists.

The most noteworthy event was the victory of the great Chinese people, who have broken free from the shackles of imperialism and feudal oppression and established the People's Republic of China. In the past year, all people's democratic countries have achieved significant political and economic successes. The economic situation in the United States and the Marshallized countries of Europe is completely different, with new economic crises rapidly developing in these countries. In all capitalist countries, unemployment is increasing, the living standards of the working people are declining disastrously, and the impoverishment of the masses is intensifying.

The imperialists are seeking a way out of their increasingly profound contradictions by frantically preparing for another war.

The people of the world hate war and do not want war. One of the great achievements of 1949 was the establishment of a strong and organized front of peace advocates, uniting hundreds of millions of active fighters for peace in its ranks. All progressive humanity is uniting around the Soviet Union. The epoch-making victories of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and the successes achieved by democratic humanity, are inseparable from the name of the greatest leader and teacher of all progressive humanity. Under the brilliant guidance of Comrade Stalin, the Soviet people enter the new year of 1950 full of confidence in the great cause of communism, looking forward to 1950—a year of new victories and new successes on the road to building communism.

    光荣胜利的一年
    【新华社北京二日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报在一九四九年除夕日以《光荣胜利的一年》为题发表社论，将一九四九年苏联的共产主义建设及世界和平民主与社会主义阵营所获得的光辉胜利作了简明的总结。
    社论写道：一九四九年在我国人民争取伟大共产主义事业胜利的英雄斗争史上添加了辉煌的一页。在布尔什维克党的领导下，在斯大林同志天才的指引下，苏联人民为了他们所钟爱的国家的幸福赢得了卓越的劳动成就。一九四九年，提前完成战后五年计划的斗争已获得了出色的成就。一九四九年，苏联工业的总产量，已超过了一九四零年百分之四十以上。社会主义农业正在稳步进展中。在工业与农业所获得的成就的基础上，我国劳动人民的物质与文化福利正在稳步地提高。苏联人民在共产主义建设中所获得的伟大成就，说明了社会主义制度的好处及其对腐败透顶的资本主义制度的无比的优越性。
    一九四九年是强大的和平民主与社会主义阵营赢得了进一步卓越成就的一年。同时，一九四九年给帝国主义反动阵营、战争贩子阵营带来了进一步的失败，一九四九年进一步加深了帝国主义之间的一切矛盾。
    最堪注意的大事，便是伟大的中国人民的胜利，他们业已挣脱了帝国主义的桎梏与封建压迫，并建立了中华人民共和国。过去的一年，一切人民民主国家在政治与经济方面都获得重大成就。美国及欧洲各马歇尔化国家的经济状况，则完全两样，在这些国家中，新的经济危机正在迅速发展中。在一切资本主义国家里，失业正在增加，劳动人民的生活标准正在灾难性地下降，群众的贫困化正在加剧。
    帝国主义者正在沿着疯狂地准备另一次战争的道路来寻求摆脱日益深刻的矛盾的出路。
    全世界的人民都憎恨战争，也不要战争。一九四九年所获得的伟大成就之一，就是强有力的、有组织的和平拥护者阵线的成立，这一阵线在自己行列中团结了数以亿计的积极争取和平的斗士。全体进步人类正团结在苏联的周围。苏联和人民民主国家的划时代的胜利，民主人类所获得的成功，是和全体进步人类最伟大的领袖与导师的名字分不开的。苏联人民在斯大林同志天才的指导下，进入新的一九五○年，对共产主义的伟大事业充满信心，瞻望着一九五○年——在建设共产主义的道路上将获得新胜利与新成功的一年。
