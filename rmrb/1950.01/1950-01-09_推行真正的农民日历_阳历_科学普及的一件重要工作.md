Promoting a True Farmer's Calendar—The Gregorian Calendar: An Important Task of Scientific Popularization
Xue Qin访, Associate Professor, Department of Physics, National Peking University

Recently, the Science Popularization Bureau of the Ministry of Culture invited teachers from major middle schools in Beijing to a symposium to discuss various tasks of scientific popularization. I believe there is a task that is closely related to farmers and can be implemented immediately, which is to promote the true farmer's calendar – the Gregorian calendar. Many people think that farmers farm according to the lunar calendar, so the lunar calendar cannot be abolished, otherwise it would be very inconvenient for farmers to farm. In fact, farmers do not farm according to the lunar calendar at all. What they rely on for cultivation are the twenty-four solar terms: Beginning of Spring, Rain Water, Awakening of Insects, Spring Equinox, Pure Brightness, Grain Rain, Beginning of Summer, Grain Full, Grain in Ear, Summer Solstice, Minor Heat, Major Heat, Beginning of Autumn, End of Heat, White Dew, Autumn Equinox, Cold Dew, Frost's Descent, Beginning of Winter, Minor Snow, Major Snow, Winter Solstice, Minor Cold, and Major Cold. The dates of these solar terms are not fixed every year in the lunar calendar, and the changes are very large, sometimes differing by ten or twenty days. For example, the Autumn Equinox was on the 21st day of the eighth lunar month last year, the 2nd day of the eighth lunar month this year, and will be on the 12th day of the eighth lunar month next year. Another example is the Beginning of Winter, which was on the 7th day of the tenth lunar month last year, the 18th day of the ninth lunar month this year, and will be on the 29th day of the ninth lunar month next year. Therefore, if farmers want to know the detailed and accurate dates of the solar terms, they still have to ask a literate person to look at the almanac for them. Therefore, the lunar calendar is very inconvenient for farmers to farm. However, these solar terms are very fixed every year in the Gregorian calendar. For example, the Autumn Equinox is every year on September 23rd of the Gregorian calendar, and the Beginning of Winter is every year on October 8th of the Gregorian calendar. Even if there is a difference, it is only one or two days. Therefore, if farmers understand the Gregorian calendar, the dates of the twenty-four solar terms are very easy to remember. Therefore, the Gregorian calendar is very convenient for farmers to farm. This means that the true farmer's calendar is the Gregorian calendar, not the lunar calendar.

We know that the Earth rotates around its axis passing through the North and South Poles every twenty-four hours, which is one day. The side of the Earth facing the Sun is day, and the side facing away from the Sun is night. In addition to rotating, the Earth also revolves around the Sun in a certain elliptical orbit, which is called revolution. One revolution of the Earth is one year, which is three hundred and sixty-five days and six hours. We also know that during the revolution, when the Earth reaches certain positions on its orbit, the sunlight shines directly on the ground where we are, and the weather is very hot, which is summer. When the Earth reaches certain positions, the sunlight shines obliquely on the ground where we are, and the weather is very cold, which is winter. Therefore, the changes in seasons depend entirely on the position of the Earth during its revolution.

The Gregorian calendar we use now has a total of 365 days each year, which is six hours less than the Earth's revolution around the Sun each year. It is only one day short every four years, which is a leap day. A leap day is added in February, so the difference is not significant. However, the lunar calendar has to follow the phases of the moon, that is, the new moon is called the first day (朔), and the full moon is called the fifteenth day (望), and the time from朔 to 朔 is twenty-nine and a half days, so each year only has three hundred and fifty-four days (twelve times twenty-nine and a half days). Each year is eleven days shorter than the Earth's revolution around the Sun, and every three years it is one month short, which is a leap month. When there is a leap, a month must be added. For example, this year there is a leap in the seventh month, with a total of three hundred and eighty-four days, which is nineteen days more than the Earth's revolution around the Sun. This difference is quite large.

Therefore, what truly represents the Earth's revolution, that is, what truly represents the changes in the climate, is the Gregorian calendar, not the lunar calendar. Now, if we divide the Earth's revolution orbit into twenty-four parts according to time, representing the twenty-four solar terms, that is, the Earth moves every fifteen days and five hours, there is a solar term. When the Earth reaches a certain position, there is a certain solar term. We just said that the number of days in the Gregorian calendar is close to the number of days in the Earth's revolution, so each solar term has a fixed date in the Gregorian calendar every year. The number of days in the lunar calendar differs greatly from the number of days in the Earth's revolution, so the date of each solar term cannot be determined in the lunar calendar. Therefore, although farmers use the lunar calendar to count days, they still rely on the twenty-four solar terms for farming.

In the Gregorian calendar, there are two solar terms each month, one in the first half of the month and one in the second half of the month. The dates are roughly fixed and may differ by one or two days. In the first half of the year, the solar term in the first half of the month is around the 6th of each month, and the solar term in the second half of the month is around the 21st of each month. In the second half of the year, the solar term in the first half of the month is around the 8th of each month, and the solar term in the second half of the month is around the 23rd of each month. Now we have compiled the order and dates of the twenty-four solar terms into a song:

Twenty-Four Solar Terms Song
Spring Rain惊 Spring Pure Grain
Summer Full Grain Summer Heat connected
Autumn End Dew Autumn Cold Dew Descends
Winter Snow Snow Winter Minor Major Cold
Two terms per month date fixed
Year after year no change
First half of year six, twenty-one
Second half of year eight, twenty-three
Everyone master the terms song
Sow on time, bountiful year

We all know that the method of calculating the Gregorian calendar is simple, and everyone can learn it with a little explanation. Now I have compiled a song for calculating the Gregorian calendar:

Gregorian Calendar Calculation Song
Gregorian calendar is really convenient, everyone can calculate
Twelve months in a year, three hundred and sixty-five days
Large months have thirty-one days, small months have thirty days
Single months before July are large, single months after August are reduced
February has twenty-eight days, leap year adds one day
When to start a leap year, divide the Gregorian year by four

Now I have drawn a chart of the solar terms and a calendar for 1950, and I have drafted the following implementation methods:

(1) Please ask rural cadres at all levels to use winter schools or other opportunities to explain to farmers that the Gregorian calendar is the real farmer's calendar. The method of explanation should be to first ask the farmers if they know on what day of the lunar calendar a certain solar term falls, such as the Winter Solstice, what day is it this year? What day will it be next year? They will definitely answer: "The date is very uncertain and you have to look at the almanac to know." Then we tell them that in the Gregorian calendar, the date of the Winter Solstice is a fixed day, about December 23rd every year, or one or two days before or after. At this time, we can explain the principle that the twenty-four solar terms have fixed dates in the Gregorian calendar according to the solar term chart.

(2) In conspicuous places in the countryside, erect a large wooden sign with a colorful solar term chart (the sun is in red, the equator is in yellow, and the earth is in green) and a calendar. The solar term song and the Gregorian calendar calculation song should also be written on it. When there are many people looking at the chart during work, we can take the opportunity to explain it to the farmers. Also, whenever a solar term arrives, a small red flag should be nailed to the position of that solar term to make people pay attention to the current solar term. In addition, a small red flag should be nailed to the date grid of each day on the calendar, and each household should take turns sending someone every morning to move the small red flag to the date grid of that day. This will allow everyone to understand and become familiar with the solar term chart and the calendar.

When implementing this, it is necessary to make farmers feel that the Gregorian calendar is simple to calculate, the solar terms are fixed, easy to remember, and really convenient for them. At the same time, make farmers feel that the lunar calendar is troublesome to calculate, the solar terms are uncertain, difficult to remember, and really inconvenient for them. In this way, farmers will naturally not use the lunar calendar and will be happy to use the Gregorian calendar.

### 推行真正的农民日历—阳历  科学普及的一件重要工作

    推行真正的农民日历—阳历  科学普及的一件重要工作
    国立北京大学物理系副教授  薛琴访
    近来文化部科学普及局邀请北京各大中学教师开座谈会，讨论科学普及的各种工作。我认为有一件跟农民有密切关系，而且可以立即推行的科学普及工作，就是推行真正的农民日历——阳历。许多人以为农民种田是根据阴历，所以阴历不能废除，否则对农民种田是非常不便的。其实农民种田何尝是根据阴历，他们耕种所依据的是立春、雨水、惊蛰、春分、清明、谷雨、立夏、小满、芒种、夏至、小暑、大暑、立秋、处暑、白露、秋分、寒露、霜降、立冬、小雪、大雪、冬至、小寒、大寒二十四个节气。这些节气的日期，在阴历中每年并不一定，变化很大，有时可以差一二十天。比如秋分，去年在阴历八月二十一日，今年在八月初二，明年在八月十二日。又如立冬，去年在阴历十月初七，今年在九月十八日，明年在九月二十九日。因此农民要想知道详细确实的节气日子，还得要请识字的先生替他看看历书，所以阴历对农民耕种是非常不方便的。但是这些节气在阳历中每年却十分一定。比如秋分，每年都在阳历九月二十三日，立冬每年都在阳历十月八日，即便有差，也不过一二日而已。因此如果农民懂得用阳历，二十四个节气的日期是非常容易记得的。所以阳历对农民耕种是非常方便的，这就是说真正的农民日历是阳历而不是阴历。
    我们知道地球每二十四小时绕着通过南北极的地轴自转地轴一周，就是一日。地球向太阳的一面就是昼，背太阳的一面就是夜。地球除自转外，它还绕着太阳，在一定的椭圆形轨道上移动，这叫公转。地球公转一周就是一年。计时有三百六十五日又六小时。我们又知道，在公转时，地球走到轨道上的某些位置时，太阳光直射到我们所在的地面，天气就很热，就是夏季。地球走到某些位置，太阳光斜射到我们所在的地面时，天气就很冷，就是冬季。因此季节寒暖的变化，完全要看地球公转时所在的位置而定。
    现在我们所用的阳历，每年共有三百六十五日，比地球公转一周每年要差六小时，每四年才差一日，就是闰日，逢闰就在二月内加一日，所以相差不大。但是阴历因为要就月亮的盈亏，就是说要把新月叫初一（朔），满月叫十五（望），而从朔到朔的时间是二十九日又半日，所以每年只有三百五十四日（一十二个二十九天半）。每一年要比地球公转一周差十一日，每三年就要差一个月，就是闰月。逢闰就得增加一月，比如今年闰七月，共有三百八十四日，比地球公转一周多一十九日，这差数相当大。
    因此真正能代表地球公转，也就是说真正能代表气节变化的，是阳历而不是阴历。现在如果我们把地球公转的轨道按时间分为二十四分，代表二十四个节气，就是说地球每走一十五天又五小时，就有一个节气。地球走到一定的位置，就有一定的节气。我们刚才说过，阳历的天日与地球公转的日数差不多，所以每一个节气在阳历的日期中每年是有一定的。而阴历的天日与公转日数相差很大，所以每一个节气在阴历的日期中是无法确定的。所以农人虽用阴历计日，而种田仍只有依据二十四个节气。
    在阳历中每月有两个节气，上半月一个节气，下半月一个节气，日期大概一定，有时可以差一二日。在上半年，上半月的节气大约在每月六日，下半月的节气大约在每月二十一日。在下半年，上半月的节气约在每月八日，下半月的节气约在每月二十三日。现在我们把二十四个节气的次序和日期编成一个歌：
            二十四节气歌
    春雨惊春清谷天
    夏满芒夏暑相连
    秋处露秋寒露降
    冬雪雪冬小大寒
    每月两节日期定
    年年如此不更变
    上半年来六、廿一
    下半年来八、廿三
    人人熟读节气歌
    按时播种过丰年
    我们都知道阳历推算的方法简单，只须略加解释，人人都可以学会。现在我把阳历推算的方法编成一个歌：
            阳历推算歌
    阳历真方便  人人会推算
    一年十二月  三百六五天
    月大三十一  月小三十天
    七前单月大  八后单月减
    二月二十八  闰年加一天
    何时始逢闰  四除公历年
    现在我绘制了一张一九五○年的节气图和日历表，并拟定下列推行的办法：
    （一）请各级农村干部利用冬学或他种机会，给农民解释阳历才是真正的农民日历。解释的方式，要先问农民知不知道某一个节气在阴历的那一天，比如冬至节，今年在那一天？明年又在那一天？他必然回答说：“日期很不一定，要看历书才知道。”于是我们就告诉他，在阳历中，冬至日期有一定天日，每年约在十二月二十三日，或前后一二日。这时就可以按照节气图，讲出二十四个节气在阳历中有一定日期的道理。
    （二）在农村当道的地方，立一高大的木牌，用颜色绘制节气图（太阳用红色，赤道用黄色，地球用绿色）和日历表。并把节气歌和阳历推算歌都写在上面。逢上工的时候，如有很多的来看图时，可以乘机给农民讲解。并且在每到一节气时，就在该节气位置上，钉上一杆小红旗使人注意当时的节气。又在日历表上，每天的日期格内，钉上一个小红旗，并且每天早晨各户轮流派人移动小红旗至该天的日期格内。这样可以使大家对节气图和日历表了解和熟习。
    在推行时，务必要使农民感到阳历推算简单、节气一定、容易记忆、对他确实方便。同时使农民感到阴历推算麻烦，节气不定，难于记忆，对他确实不便。这样农民自然而然就不会使用阴历而乐于使用阳历了。
