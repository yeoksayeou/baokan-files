    North China Begins Inspection of Autumn Grain Collection Work
    Problems such as Unreasonable Burdens Need to be Resolved Urgently
    The Best Method is to Convene County, District, and Village People's Representative Conferences
    [Report from this newspaper] The autumn grain collection in North China this year has been basically completed successfully. This newspaper made a comprehensive report on this on the 12th. At present, public grain from various places is about to be fully stored in warehouses, and the enthusiasm of the masses is extremely high. At the end of the process, some areas have begun to inspect the grain collection work and have discovered some outstanding issues that must be resolved reasonably.
    According to reports from various places, the urgent problems that exist now are:
    1. There are phenomena of excessively heavy or light distribution quotas. The burdens are inconsistent between some districts and districts, villages and villages. For example, in Jiaxiang County, Pingyuan, Jiuzhuang and Mazhuang West Village are adjacent to each other, and the geological conditions are similar, but the district assigned Jiuzhuang 12 jin per mu, while Mazhuang was assigned only 4 jin per mu. There are also significant disparities between counties. For example, in Qin County, the average yield is 8 dou and 1 sheng, with a burden of 22 jin per mu, while in a neighboring county, the average yield is 8 dou and 8 sheng, but the autumn grain collection burden alone reaches 26 jin per mu. Similar phenomena have occurred in some counties in Pingyuan and northern Henan, and individual areas in Hebei Province, causing dissatisfaction among some of the masses who demand that the government correct them quickly. The basic reasons for these deviations are mainly that governments at all levels have not earnestly grasped the leadership of the grain collection work. Certain county and district cadres are only satisfied with the lively enthusiasm of the masses in handing over grain and the distribution figures formulated while sitting in their offices, and have not truly studied and grasped the specific situation. For example, the crop yield in Jincheng was originally reported as 57%, but in reality, the county's crop yield was only 48%, with 36 villages having yields below 30%. In reality, the amount that can be collected is not much. But on the other hand, there are also places where the burden is easily reduced when they hear people complaining about it being too heavy. Secondly, a small number of village cadres have a lot of good-quality land. Some of them underreport yields or adopt village-based methods, underreporting the total land and yield of the village, resulting in unfair burdens.
    2. There is egalitarianism in burden reduction and exemption. In some areas, there is insufficient consideration for the families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers, as well as the poor, elderly, weak, disabled, and widowed. On the other hand, in some villages in Yanggao, Chahar Province, only the burdens of poor peasants and hired laborers are simply reduced, or the reductions for poor peasants and hired laborers are added to the middle peasants, causing dissatisfaction among the middle peasants.
    3. The conversion rate for economic crops is set too low, and the difference is very large when converted at market prices (for example, in Changzhi City, the ratio of cotton to rice is 1 jin of cotton to 13 jin of rice), and the masses demand price adjustments. In addition, many cadres in various regions simply use administrative orders to complete the assigned quotas, and illegal detention of people has even occurred in individual places.
    Experience has proven that the best way to correct these deviations is to convene people's representative conferences at the county, district, and village levels, and solve the problems fairly and reasonably through democratic discussion. In 1949, when arranging the grain collection, Tong County, Hebei Province, and other places convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life to discuss the grain collection, so that this task could be completed smoothly. Now, some places are also preparing to convene people's representative conferences from all walks of life to solve the problems that have already occurred in the grain collection. This is a completely correct and necessary measure. In the representative conference, some feasible methods should be realistically formulated, such as calculating the output by dividing villages, several villages, or dozens of villages into units, and uniformly allocating burdens to overcome parochialism. Mistakes such as the unjustified detention of people and the raising of the burden should be openly corrected, so as to improve the work style of cadres, educate, and unite the broad masses of people. In order to hold the representative conference well, the leadership must conduct thorough inspections and make full preparations in order to solve the problems quickly and effectively, and on this basis, mobilize all strata to shift to the great production movement.

    华北开始检查秋征工作
    发现负担不合理等问题急待解决
    最好方法是开县区村人民代表会
    【本报讯】华北今年征收业已基本胜利完成，十二日本报曾对此作了综合报导，目前各地公粮即将全部入库，群众热情极为高涨，在结束的时候，有些地区已经开始检查征收工作，发现了一些遗留问题，必须合理地予以解决。
    据各地报导，目前存在的急待解决的问题是：
    一、分配数字上有畸重畸轻现象，有些区与区、村与村负担不一致如平原嘉祥县酒庄和马庄西村相邻，地质相差不多，但区上分派酒庄为每亩十二斤，马庄则每亩四斤，县与县间也有很大悬殊，如沁县平均产量八斗一，每亩负担二十二斤，而邻近县平均产量为八斗○八，每负担亩只秋屯一项即达二十六斤。平原，豫北各县与河北某些县个别地区也有类似现象发生，造成部分群众不满，要求政府迅予纠正，产生这些偏向的基本原因，主要的是各级政府对于征收工作没有抓紧认真领导，某些县区干部只满足于群众轰轰烈烈缴粮情绪，和坐在屋子里所制定的分配数字，没有真正研究与掌握具体情况，如晋城年景原报为五成七，实际该县年成只有四成八，有三十六村收成在三成以下，实际上能够征收的数字即不多；但另一方面，也有的地方则是听到下边喊重便轻易减轻。其次是少数村干部土地量多质强，他们有的少报产量，或是采取村本位主义办法，少报全村土地及产量，造成负担不公。
    二、在负担减免上存在有平均主义思想，部分地区对烈军工属及贫苦的老弱残废孤寡照顾不够，另方面如察北阳高某些村子则只是单纯给贫雇农减免负担，或把贫雇农减下来的加到中农身上，致引起中农不满。
    三、对经济作物折合率订的低，按市价折合则差额很大（如长治市棉米比例是棉花一斤折米十三斤），群众要求调整价格。此外，不少地区干部单纯用行政命令方法去完成分配数目，个别地方甚至发生非法扣押人的错误现象。
    经验证明：纠正这些偏向最好的方法是召开县及区村的各界人民代表会，经过民主讨论，公平合理地解决问题，一九四九年在布置征收时，河北通县等地均曾召开了各界人民代表会议讨论征收，使这一任务得以顺利完成，现在也有的地方准备召开各界人民代表会来解决征收中已经发生的问题，这是完全正确的必要的措施，在代表会中应实事求是地规定一些可行的办法，如可以以一村、数村或数十村为单位划片计算产量，统一分配以克服本位主义，可以公开纠正类似无故扣押人以及提高负担面等错误，借以改进干部工作作风教育与团结广大人民；为了开好代表会，领导上必须深入检查充分准备，以便迅速有效解决问题，并在这一基础上动员各阶层转入大生产运动。
