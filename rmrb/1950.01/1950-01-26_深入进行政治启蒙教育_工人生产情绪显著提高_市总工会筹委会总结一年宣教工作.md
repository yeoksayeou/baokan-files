    [Beijing News] The Public Industry Workers' Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting of propaganda and education cadres of public factories and enterprises throughout the city on the 23rd of this month to summarize and review the propaganda and education work in factories over the past year. Thirty-five units, including the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the 70th Ordnance Factory, and the Telecommunications Bureau, attended the meeting. The main achievement of the factory propaganda and education work last year was carrying out political enlightenment education among workers. According to statistics from September of last year, 28 percent of the 156,000 workers already organized, or 44,000 people, received preliminary policy education, current affairs education, or participated in systematic learning in workers' night schools, workers' literacy classes, and other schools. Through these studies, the average worker clarified the relationship between the working class and the Communist Party ideologically, recognized the significance of labor creating the world, the people's democratic dictatorship, the notion that workers of the world are one family, and the nature and tasks of trade unions. In conducting summer worker education and internationalism education, the Propaganda and Education Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee compiled three types of cultural textbooks for advanced, intermediate, and elementary levels, along with teaching materials such as "Selected Workers' Songs," "Labor Creates the World," "Basic Issues of the Chinese Revolution," and "Workers of the World are One Family," issuing a total of 77,400 copies. In addition, in coordination with the Municipal Government Education Bureau, the problem of education for workers' children was initially resolved. Seventy-three classes were added to municipal primary schools, and eighteen classes were added to middle schools, enrolling a total of 2,650 primary school students and 932 middle school students who were children of workers. In terms of propaganda work, the central content revolved around the task of restoring and developing production, combined with current affairs education, such as organizing workers throughout the city to enthusiastically participate in activities commemorating "February 7th," "May 1st," "July 7th," and other events, as well as mass gatherings celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China and the success of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference. Workers received significant practical education. In terms of written publications, the Propaganda and Education Department published two issues of "Labor Movement Documents" and five issues of "Beijing Labor Movement," issuing a total of 9,800 copies, totaling more than 260,000 words. In twenty-five public enterprise units, including the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Shijingshan Power Plant, and the Telecommunications Bureau, workers themselves ran sixteen types of letterpress and mimeographed small newspapers, with a total circulation of more than 8,000 copies per issue. A total of more than 600 people participated as editors, reporters, and distributors. More than 1,200 worker correspondents were organized in twenty-five public enterprises and seventeen districts, contributing nearly 4,000 articles. Sixty-three types of wall newspapers and eighty blackboard newspapers were published. Due to the propaganda and education work over the past year, workers' production enthusiasm generally increased with the improvement of their awareness. For example, the production of the Clothing Factory increased two and a half times, and the Trolleybus Company completed the two "100-Vehicle Movement." Employees in private factories and shops also recognized the policy of labor-capital mutual benefit and signed labor-capital collective contracts. In terms of cultural and recreational activities, the Propaganda and Education Department organized various cultural troupes and film projection teams to perform and screen films in various factories more than 100 times, with an audience of more than 300,000 people. In addition, the factories organized a total of twenty amateur drama troupes and nineteen singing teams, and workers themselves created and performed more than forty plays and forty songs. The main problems existing in the propaganda and education work last year were, first of all, that the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions did not provide enough timely assistance to trade union cadres, and the worker education workers themselves did not improve along with the improvement of workers' political level; secondly, not enough research and assistance was provided to the small newspapers of various factories and enterprises. In terms of work methods, there was a lack of planning, failing to "seize key points, learn from experience, and promote all-round development."
    Based on the experience of last year, the following points should be noted in this year's worker education: Among workers who have not yet received political education, political enlightenment education should still be the primary focus. In addition to the staff and workers schools run by the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, various factories and industries should open small worker training classes to conduct policy, political, and trade union organization education. Workers who have already received preliminary political education can participate in formal worker after-school education with a focus on cultural classes. Trade unions should be responsible for organizing technical education, and obtain administrative assistance and allocate teachers. When combining education with current affairs, it must first be based on the overall spirit of production, implementing the development of production.

    深入进行政治启蒙教育
    工人生产情绪显著提高
    市总工会筹委会总结一年宣教工作
    【北京讯】北京市总工会筹委会公营产业工人工作委员会于本月二十三日召开全市公营工厂、企业工会宣教干部会议，总结检讨一年来工厂的宣教工作。到会的有石景山钢铁厂、七十兵工厂、电信局等三十五个单位。去年工厂宣教工作的收获，主要是在工人中进行了政治启蒙教育。根据去年九月份统计，在已组织的十五万六千工人中，有百分之二十八即四万四千人受到初步政策教育、时事教育，或是参加了工人夜校、工人识字班等校有系统的学习。经过这些学习，一般工人从思想上明确了工人阶级与共产党的关系，认识了劳动创造世界、人民民主专政、天下工人是一家等的意义以及工会的性质和任务等。在进行暑期工人教育和国际主义教育中，市总工会筹委会宣教部编写了高、中、初三种文化课本，与“工人歌选”、“劳动创造世界”、“中国革命基本问题”、“天下工人是一家”等教材，共发行七万七千四百册。此外，并配合市政府教育局初步解决了工人子弟教育问题，在市立小学增设七十三班，中学增设十八班，共招收了工人子弟小学生二千六百五十人，中学生九百三十二人入学。在宣传工作方面，中心内容是围绕着恢复与发展生产的任务，并结合时事进行了教育，如组织全市工人热烈参加纪念“二七”、“五一”、“七七”等活动及庆祝中华人民共和国成立、庆祝亚澳工会会议成功等群众集会，工人得到很大的实际教育。在文字出版工作中，宣教部出版了两期“工运文献”和五期“北京工运”，共发行九千八百册，二十六万余字。在石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂、电信局等二十五个公营企业单位中，工人自己办了十六种铅印及油印小报，每期发行共八千余份。参加工作的编辑、记者、发行人员共有六百余人；在二十五个公营企业和十七个区，组织了一千二百多个工人通讯员，投稿近四千篇；出刊六十三种壁报，八十块黑板报。由于一年来的宣传教育工作，工人的生产情绪随着觉悟提高而普遍提高了。如被服厂的生产增加了二倍半，电车公司完成了二次百辆车运动。私营工厂商店中的职工也认清了劳资两利的政策，而订立了劳资集体合同。在文娱活动方面，宣教部曾组织各文工团、电影队到各工厂演出和放映百余场，观众三十余万人。此外，各工厂共组织了二十个业余剧团和十九个歌咏队，工人自己创作并演出了四十多个剧和四十多首歌曲。去年宣教工作中存在的主要问题，首先是市总工会筹委会及时给予工会干部的帮助不够，工人教育工作者本身没有跟随工人政治水平的提高而提高；其次是对各工厂企业的小报研究帮助不够。在工作方法上缺乏计划，没能“抓住重点，吸取经验，推动全面”。
    根据去年的经验，今年工人教育中应注意的是：还没进行政治教育的工人中，仍应首先以政治启蒙教育为主，除市总工会筹委会所办的职工学校外，各工厂行业应开办小型工人训练班，进行政策、政治、工会组织教育；在已经受过初步政治教育的工人中，则可参加正规的以文化课为主的工人业余教育。技术教育，工会要负责组织，并取得行政上帮助，配备教员。在结合时事进行教育时，首先必须根据围绕生产，贯彻发展生产的总精神进行。
