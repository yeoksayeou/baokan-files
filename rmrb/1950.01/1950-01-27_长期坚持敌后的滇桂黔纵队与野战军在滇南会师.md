    Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 26th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army advancing into Yunnan has victoriously joined forces with the Dian-Gui-Qian Column, which has been persisting in the struggle behind enemy lines in Yunnan for a long time. These two fraternal troops, in the continuous mountains of southeastern Yunnan, jointly annihilated the last remaining bandits who were disturbing the southwestern territory. The Dian-Gui-Qian Column supported the advance of the main force with brotherly love. Most of them were assembled along the roads the main force passed through, enduring hardship and cold day and night to solve all the difficulties in the advance for the main force. They carried bags of grain from villages hundreds of miles away to the roadside, climbed high mountains to cut firewood, and sent them to various supply stations for the main force to use. They mobilized all cadres and soldiers to lead the way, repair bridges, widen small roads, cut down weeds, and fill in ditches. The 22nd Regiment of the Dian-Gui-Qian Column even rushed to repair 200 miles of mountain roads on the Yunnan-Guizhou border overnight, building more than 40 bridges with wood and stone. They voluntarily reduced their ration from one catty of rice per meal to twelve taels, to provide the surplus grain to the main force. When the comrades of the Field Army saw that the comrades of the local troops were living hard and lacked clothing, they voluntarily gave their extra single clothes and shoes as gifts, and also brought books and newspapers for the comrades of the local troops to read.

    长期坚持敌后的滇桂黔纵队与野战军在滇南会师
    【新华社西南前线二十六日电】挺进云南的人民解放军某部已和长期坚持云南敌后斗争的滇桂黔纵队胜利会师。这两支兄弟部队在滇东南边境的崇山峻岭间，共同歼灭了窜扰西南国土的最后一股残匪。滇桂黔纵队以兄弟般的友爱支援大军前进。他们大部都集结在大军经过的路上，不分日夜忍劳耐寒地为主力部队解决一切行进中的困难，他们曾从百里以外的农村里，把粮食一袋袋背到大路边上，爬到高山上砍柴，并送到各供应站，供给大军应用。他们动员了全体干部战士带路、修桥，把小路加宽，把荒草割光，把沟渠填平。滇桂黔纵队第二十二团并连夜赶修了滇桂边界的二百里山路，用木料和石块建筑了四十多座桥梁。他们自动把每餐一斤米减到十二两，以节余的粮食供给大军。野战军的同志看到地方部队同志生活艰苦，缺少衣穿，就纷纷自动将自己多余的单衣和鞋子相赠，同时拿出书籍报纸送给地方部队同志阅读。
