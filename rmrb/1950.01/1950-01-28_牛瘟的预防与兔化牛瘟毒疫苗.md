    Rinderpest Prevention and Rabbit-Adapted Rinderpest Virus Vaccine
    Zhang Aitian
    I. Rinderpest Must Emphasize Prevention: There is a lack of effective drugs for treating rinderpest. If rinderpest serum can be injected in time when the body temperature just rises in the initial stage of the disease, it may save 30% of the animals. Therefore, rinderpest must emphasize prevention.
    There are many kinds of medicines for preventing rinderpest, such as rinderpest serum, rinderpest goat virus vaccine, rinderpest organ vaccine, chicken embryo rinderpest vaccine, and rabbit-adapted rinderpest virus. The efficacy and value of each medicine are briefly compared and described as follows:
    1. Rinderpest Serum: It can be used for treatment. If used for prevention, the intravenous or subcutaneous injection requires 100 to 200 cc each time. At most, it cannot maintain immunity for more than four months, and the injection is troublesome. The cost of the medicine is high, the injection volume is large, and it is very inconvenient to carry. The advantage is that there is no danger after injection during the incubation period of the disease. Therefore, in areas where rinderpest occurs, focusing on injecting rinderpest serum can treat and prevent the disease at the same time.
    2. Rinderpest Goat Virus Vaccine: It is a relatively new thing, but unfortunately, it has not been fully developed. However, it is known to have immunity to rinderpest. According to test reports, the vaccine has a severe reaction to healthy cattle. After injection, the body temperature of some cattle increased to 41.6 degrees Celsius, which is dangerous. Before the success of the rabbit-adapted rinderpest virus, it was noted by many scholars. Now it seems unnecessary to pay attention to it anymore.
    3. Rinderpest Organ Vaccine: It is a rinderpest vaccine made from bovine spleen and lymph. It has a good effect when injected into healthy cattle as a preventive agent. However, because it needs to be made with calves, killing one calf only prevents 60 calves. The cost is high, and it is difficult to carry out universal preventive injections in practice.
    4. Chicken Embryo Rinderpest Vaccine: Because the cost is low, it has development prospects and should be actively promoted. However, China has not yet manufactured and applied it.
    5. Rabbit-Adapted Rinderpest Virus Vaccine: It is currently the most successful rinderpest vaccine. The manufacturing procedure is simple, and the cost is low. Each rabbit can produce 300 cc of vaccine. The injection volume is 1 cc per head of cattle, which can prevent 300 cattle. It is very convenient to carry it to various places for epidemic prevention work, and its reaction is mild (not significant). The immune efficacy for foreign cattle breeds is at least one year, and the immunity period for Mongolian cattle is still under study. There is no risk of spreading the virus. Because of its high practical value, I would like to introduce the manufacturing method in more detail.
    II. Preparation Method of Rabbit-Adapted Rinderpest Virus Vaccine: In 1939, the Japanese Nakamura published "After the rinderpest virus blood passes through the rabbit body for 100 generations, the pathogenicity to rabbits is enhanced, while the pathogenicity to cattle is weakened." Now, the North China Agricultural Science Institute, based on this principle, made a vaccine from the "rabbit-adapted virus" that has passed through 800 generations of rabbits. After rinderpest preventive injection, the body temperature reaction is not obvious, and the cattle obtain immunity to rinderpest, and it is guaranteed that the healthy cattle injected with the rabbit-adapted rinderpest virus vaccine will not be infected with rinderpest again for at least one year. The manufacturing method is:
    1. Materials: Purebred white healthy rabbits weighing about two *shi jin* (approximately 1 kg), 4% sodium citrate.
    2. Equipment: Mortar, 50 cc syringe, 1 cc syringe, straight bone scissors, round bone scissors, dissecting knife, tweezers, rabbit fixing stand, alcohol lamp, alcohol cotton, sterilized physiological saline, soap solution.
    3. Manufacturing Sequence:
        ① Measure body temperature before inoculation: Select healthy rabbits and measure the body temperature once. If the body temperature is normal (38.4 to 38.7 degrees Celsius is most suitable), it can be used for inoculation.
        ② Inoculation: Inject 0.5 cc of rabbit-adapted rinderpest virus blood from the ear vein.
        ③ Reaction after inoculation: Within 36 to 48 hours after inoculation, the body temperature rises to 40.5 degrees (Celsius) or higher, and remains for 36 to 48 hours, and the body temperature begins to drop.
        ④ Autopsy and lymph collection: Kill the rabbit on the fourth day after inoculation when the body temperature drops and collect the lymph. The sequence is:
            A. Fix the rabbit in the extreme stage of the disease (when the body temperature begins to drop) on the rabbit fixing stand with the abdomen facing up.
            B. Cut off the rabbit hair at the heart.
            C. Use a 50 cc syringe to first draw 2 to 3 cc of sodium citrate, and then take blood from the heart, which is toxic blood.
            D. Take the spleen and lymph: Apply soap solution to the abdomen and then peel the skin. After peeling the skin, first take the spleen and then take the lymph, and then remove the attached fat. After inspection, carefully crush and grind it with a mortar, mix it with a little sterilized physiological saline, and filter it with a copper wire mesh.
            E. Dilute the filtrate 100 times with sterilized physiological saline; dilute the toxic blood with 10 times physiological saline to make an emulsion, which is the rabbit-adapted rinderpest virus vaccine.
    4. Precautions for Manufacturing and Storage:
        ① All procedures must be carried out under sterile conditions.
        ② The instruments must be boiled and sterilized before use.
        ③ The instruments before taking the spleen and lymph must be burned and used after cooling.
        ④ There are gray spots on the small intestine of the dissected diseased rabbit, which is a good characteristic of the disease, otherwise discard it.
        ⑤ Lymphatic spleen can be stored in zero-degree glycerol saline for 15 days, and is effective at spring room temperature (about 14 degrees) for 36 hours. Therefore, the vaccine produced should be used on the same day as much as possible.
        ⑥ The medicine is afraid of high temperature and sunlight, and should be stored in a cold and dark place.
        ⑦ Do not allow rabbit hair to contaminate the organs during the manufacturing process.
        ⑧ The dissection room should be quiet, and mosquitoes and flies should be avoided.

    牛瘟的预防与兔化牛瘟毒疫苗
    张爱田
    一、牛瘟必须着重预防：治疗牛瘟缺乏特效药，若能在最初发病体温刚刚升高时，及时注射牛瘟血清，可能救活百分之三十，因此，牛瘟必须着重防疫。
    防疫牛瘟的药液种类很多，如牛瘟血清，牛瘟山羊病毒疫苗，牛瘟脏器苗，鸡胚胎牛瘟疫苗和兔化牛瘟毒等，兹就各药的效力和价值等简略比较分述如下：
    １、牛瘟血清：可做治疗之用，若用于防疫，因每次静脉或皮下注射量须一百至二百西西，最多尚不能保持四个月以上的免疫力，且注射麻烦，药液成本较高，注射量多，携带很不方便。其优点是在病疫潜伏期里注射后，无危险发生，因此在牛瘟发生地区，重点注射牛瘟血清，可以边治边防。
    ２、牛瘟山羊病毒疫苗：是比较新的东西，可惜至今尚未研究成熟，但确知其对牛瘟有免疫能力，据试验报告，该疫苗对健康牛的反应剧烈，注射后，第四日体温，有的增高到摄氏四十一度点六，有危险性，在兔化牛瘟毒未成功前，曾被许多学者注意过，现在似乎没有再被注意的必要了。
    ３、牛瘟脏器苗：是用牛的脾脏和淋巴为原料制成之牛瘟疫苗。做为预防剂给健康牛注射后，收效很好，但是因为要以小牛来做，杀一小牛只预防六十头小牛，成本高，要做普遍防疫注射，事实难于办到。
    ４、鸡胚胎牛瘟疫苗：因为成本低廉，有发展前途，应积极提倡，但是，现在中国尚未制造应用。
    ５、兔化牛瘟毒疫苗：在目前是最成功的一种牛瘟疫苗，制造手续简便，成本低廉，每头家兔可制疫苗三百西西，注射量每头牛一西西，可预防三百头牛，携带至各地做防疫工作，甚为方便，且其反应轻微（不显著），免疫效能洋种牛最少在一年以上，对于蒙古牛的免疫期尚在研究中。没有散布病毒的危险。因其实用价值高，愿将制法作较详细的介绍。
    二、兔化牛瘟毒疫苗的制法：一九三九年日人中村氏曾发表《用牛瘟毒血通过家兔体一百代以后，对家兔的病原性增强，而对牛的病原性减弱》。现在华北农业科学研究所根据这个原理，将通过家兔体八百代的“兔化毒”制成疫苗，做牛瘟防疫注射后，体温反应不显，而牛获得抗牛瘟的免疫力，并保证注射兔化牛瘟毒疫苗的健康牛，至少可以在一年内不再感染牛瘟。其制法是：
    １、材料：体重二市斤左右的纯种白色健康家兔，百分之四的柠檬酸钠。
    ２、器材：乳钵、五十西西注射器、一西西注射器、直骨剪子、圆骨剪子、解剖刀、镊子、家兔固定台、酒精灯、酒精棉、消毒生理盐水、石碱液。
    ３、制造顺序：
    ①接种前测体温：选出之健康兔，测体温一次，若体温正常（三十八点四到点七度最为合适）即可做接种用。
    ②接种：将兔化牛瘟毒血，零点五西西，由耳静脉注入。
    ③接种后反应情况：接种后三十六小时至四十八小时内体温升高到四十点五度（摄氏）以上，保持三十六小时到四十八小时，体温开始下降。
    ④剖杀采淋：接种后第四天，体温下降时剖杀采淋，其顺序为：
    甲、将发病极期（体温开始下降时）的家兔固定在家兔固定台上，使腹面向上。
    乙、于心脏部位剪去兔毛。
    丙、以五十西西注射器先吸入柠檬酸钠二到三西西，再自心脏内采取血液，即为毒血。
    丁、取脾脏淋巴：以石碱液涂抹腹部然后剥皮，剥皮后先取脾脏后取淋巴，然后去掉夹带之脂肪，经检定后即用乳钵仔细碾碎研磨，用少许消毒生理盐水和匀，以铜丝网滤过。
    戊、滤过后以消毒生理盐水一百倍稀释；毒血以十倍生理盐水稀释制成乳剂，即为兔化牛瘟毒疫苗。
    ４、制造与保存上应注意事项：
    ①一切手续均须无菌操作。
    ②器具在应用前必须经过煮沸消毒。
    ③取脾脏淋巴前之器具，要燃烧过，凉后使用。
    ④解剖后的病兔小肠上有灰色斑点，是为发病良好的特征，否则弃之。
    ⑤淋巴脾脏于零度甘油盐水中可保存十五日有效春季室温（十四度左右）三十六小时有效，因此制出之疫苗，以当日应用为佳。
    ⑥药液怕高温和阳光，须保存于冷暗处。
    ⑦制造过程千万勿使兔毛沾染着脏器。
    ⑧解剖室内宜安静，更要避免蚊蝇。
