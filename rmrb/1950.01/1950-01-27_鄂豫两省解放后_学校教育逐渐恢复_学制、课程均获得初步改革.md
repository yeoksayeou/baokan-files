Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 26th -- Most schools in Hubei and Henan provinces in the Central South region have been restored, and preliminary reforms have been carried out in terms of systems and curriculum. Currently, the restored schools in Hubei Province include three colleges: Provincial Education College, Provincial Medical College, and Provincial Agricultural College, as well as 136 public and private secondary schools. There are more than 800 students in colleges and universities, and 30,057 middle school students. Last summer, the province carried out teacher reform work and held summer teacher training classes from the provincial to the county level. In the four special districts of Wuchang, Hanyang, Xiaogan, and Mianyang, and the four cities of Yichang, Lishan, Xishui, and Huangmei alone, more than 4,300 teachers participated in the training classes. After the summer vacation, preliminary reforms were carried out in the restored schools, such as abolishing courses such as "Civics" and "Party Principles" that instilled reactionary ideas, as well as military training and student instruction systems. Among students, New Democracy study movements were launched, and conscious compliance with study discipline was promoted, all of which have achieved great results. In addition, in terms of cadre education in the province, Hubei Revolutionary University has trained more than 3,000 new cadres, and more than 8,700 young intellectuals trained by revolutionary cadre schools in various places have participated in revolutionary work.

Currently, Henan Province has restored 145 universities and middle schools, and more than 5,000 primary schools, with a total of more than 579,000 students. Before liberation, most teachers and students in various schools were deceived and threatened by bandit troops and fled to the south of the Yangtze River or hid in rural areas. In the early days of the liberation of vast areas of Henan in October 1948, more than 1,000 primary and secondary schools were first restored, and 120 primary and secondary schools were taken over in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou. In April last year, after the establishment of the Central Plains Provisional People's Government, the Central Plains Education Conference was held, which determined the work of strengthening rectification and reform. First, teacher training classes and summer training courses were established in Central Plains University to train and reform more than 20,000 primary and secondary school teachers successively. Secondly, teachers and students of schools that had moved south were gradually returned to their original locations to resume classes, and curriculum and systems were reformed in the restored schools, political education was strengthened, and the remaining blind orthodox concepts among students were gradually eliminated, and the old learning attitudes and methods were changed. After such rectification, the students' political and ideological level has improved, and the schools are gradually on the right track.

    鄂豫两省解放后
    学校教育逐渐恢复
    学制、课程均获得初步改革
    【新华社汉口二十六日电】中南区湖北、河南两省大部分学校都已经恢复，并进行了制度和课程方面的初步改革。现在湖北省已经恢复的学校有省立教育学院、省立医学院、省立农学院等三个学院，公私立中等学校一百三十六所。专科以上学校有学生八百多人，中学生有三万零五十七人。去年暑假，该省即进行教师改造工作，从省到县普遍举办了暑期教师讲习会，仅武（昌）阳（汉阳）、孝感、沔阳、荆州等四个专区和宜昌、礼山、浠水、黄梅等四个市的讲习会，参加学习的教师就有四千三百多人。暑假以后，在已经恢复的学校中，进行了初步的改革，如取消了灌输反动思想的“公民”、“党义”等课程和军训、训育等制度。在学生方面，展开了新民主主义的学习运动和提倡自觉地遵守学习纪律，这些都收到很大的成效。此外，该省在干部教育方面，湖北革命大学已培养新干部三千多人，各地革命干部学校训练的青年知识分子，已有八千七百多人参加革命工作。
    河南省现在已经恢复的学校有大中学校一百四十五所，小学五千多所，学生共五十七万九千多人。该省在解放前夕，各校师生大部受匪军欺骗和威胁，逃到江南或隐蔽在农村中。一九四八年十月，河南广大地区解放的初期，曾首先恢复了中小学一千多所，并在开封、郑州接管了中小学一百二十所。去年四月，中原临时人民政府成立后，召开了中原教育会议，确定加强整顿和改革的工作。首先在中原大学创办师资训练班和暑期讲习会，先后培养和改造中小学教师二万多人。其次是使南迁的学校师生，陆续回境复校，并在恢复的各校中，改革课程和制度，加强政治教育，逐渐消除学生中残存的盲目正统观念，改变旧的学习态度和学习方法。经过这样的整顿后，学生的政治思想水平提高一步，各校也逐步走向正轨。
