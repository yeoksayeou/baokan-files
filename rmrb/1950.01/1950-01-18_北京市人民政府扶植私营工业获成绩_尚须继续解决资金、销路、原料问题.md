    Achievements of the Beijing Municipal People's Government in Supporting Private Industry; Continued Efforts Needed to Solve Problems of Funding, Sales, and Raw Materials
    [Our Newspaper's Report] In 1949, the Beijing Municipal People's Government devoted great efforts to supporting private industries beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood through various means, enabling them to achieve considerable development. According to statistics from the Municipal Government's Bureau of Commerce, the industries that were supported included: coarse and fine grain processing, weaving and dyeing, coal mining, knitting, garment making, ironworking, leather shoe making, match production, cigarette production, soap production, ink production, carpet making, and cotton ginning. Private coal mines such as Siwei and Hongshun in Mentougou had been in a state of decline before liberation. After liberation, they received loan support from the bank and government assistance in opening up sales channels, allowing them to overcome the slack season and gradually improve production. Dyeing and weaving factories such as Huaxing had previously faced extreme difficulties with raw materials and sales. The Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company directly stimulated the industry's production by supplying raw materials and then collecting the processed products. In this way, the People's Government helped the development of various industries through various methods such as raw material processing, raw material supply, finished product acquisition, raw material exchange for finished products, and direct ordering. According to statistics, in the past year, the various state-owned professional companies in Beijing alone have achieved the following results in supplying raw materials and absorbing finished products from private factories: In terms of supplying production raw materials: The Grain Company spent over 126.28 million catties of wheat, sorghum, millet, corn, soybeans, etc.; the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company supplied the textile, dyeing, weaving, and cotton ginning industries with over 116,000 bolts of cloth, over 160,000 bundles of yarn, and over 720,000 catties of seed cotton; the Department Store Company ensured the production of matches, dyeing and weaving products, cigarettes, soap, ink, etc. with large quantities of cotton yarn, red phosphorus, zinc oxide, paraffin, bone glue, rosin, tobacco leaves, paper rolls, glue, caustic soda, bleaching powder, sulfur blue, cashmere, zinc iron, and alum; The Leather and Fur Company and the Oils and Fats Company similarly supplied raw materials for the production of leather and carpets. In terms of absorbing finished products, the Grain Company entrusted private processing industries with processing over 91 million catties of various grains into finished products, paying processing fees and taking them back, solving the working capital difficulties of many manufacturers; the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company exchanged yarn for over 165,000 bolts of cloth from private weaving and dyeing factories, purchased over 300,000 bolts, processed over 125,000 bolts of dyeing and weaving, and processed over 700,000 catties of lint cotton and cotton seeds; the Department Store Company purchased large quantities of soap, matches, leather shoes, bed sheets, stationery, cigarettes, etc. from private factories, and exchanged raw materials for towels, socks, etc. The most significant achievement of the People's Government in supporting private industry and commerce is reflected in the fact that the production conditions of various industries that maintain regular contact with state-owned professional companies are generally more prosperous than in previous years, with flour manufacturing being the most prominent. During the same period, the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China also provided loans of 1.42418 billion yuan to 2,115 private industrial households to help them overcome various difficulties in production. Among them, 179 general industrial households received 1.01806 billion yuan; 1,338 handicraft households received 148.79 million yuan; and 598 special handicraft households received 257.33 million yuan.

    While great achievements have been made in supporting private industry, some shortcomings still exist: 1. Initially, trade companies did their best to support the development of production in private industry and purchased finished products in large quantities, but some manufacturers took the opportunity to sell inferior goods that had been stored for several years and were difficult to sell to trade companies, resulting in long-term inability to sell them and accumulation of funds. 2. Some economic workers subjectively believed that certain industries had no prospects for development, and therefore failed to take a more proactive and active approach to guiding and helping these industries improve technology, reduce costs, combine with other production, and open up sales channels. 3. The supply of raw materials is sometimes insufficient, and in the future, sources should be better opened up to achieve the purpose of developing production.

    北京市人民政府扶植私营工业获成绩
    尚须继续解决资金、销路、原料问题
    【本报讯】一九四九年一年中，京市人民政府曾以很大力量，运用各种方式扶植有利国计民生的私营工业，使其获得相当发展。据市府商业局统计，曾经扶植的行业有：粗细食粮加工业、织染业、煤业、针织、成衣、铁工、皮鞋、火柴、纸烟、肥皂、墨水、地毯、轧花等行业。门头沟四维、宏顺等私营煤矿，在解放前生产一直萎蘼不振，解放后经银行贷款扶植，政府帮助打开销路，渡过了淡月，生产日渐好转。华兴等染织厂，过去原料、销路都感极大困难，北京花纱布公司，即以供给原料，加工后收回的方式，直接刺激了该行业的生产。人民政府就这样以原料加工、供给原料、收购成品、以原料换成品及直接订货等各种方式，帮助了各行业的发展。据统计，一年来仅北京市公营各专业公司在供给私营工厂生产原料、及吸收成品方面，已获得如下成绩：供给生产原料方面：粮食公司支出小麦、高粱、谷子、玉米、黄豆等共一亿二千六百二十八万余斤；花纱布公司供给各纺织、染织、轧花等行业布十一万六千余匹，纱十六万余捆，籽棉七十二万余斤；百货公司以大量的棉纱、赤磷、亚铅华、石腊、骨胶、松香、烟叶、盘纸、胶料、火碱、漂粉、硫化青、羊绒、锌铁、石矾等，保证了火柴、染织、卷烟、肥皂、墨水等行业的生产；皮毛公司、油脂公司也同样供应了皮革、地毯等业的生产原料。吸收成品方面，粮食公司将各种食粮共九千一百余万斤委托各私营加工业制成成品后，付以加工费收回，解决了很多厂家资金的周转困难；花纱布公司以纱向私营织染厂换布共十六万五千余匹，收购三十余万匹，染织加工十二万五千余匹，皮棉、棉子的加工计七十余万斤；百货公司大批收购了私营厂家的肥皂、火柴、皮鞋、床单、文具、纸烟等，并以原料交换了手巾、袜子等。人民政府扶植私营工商业最显著的成绩表现在：凡是与公营专业公司经常保持联系的各行业，生产状况一般的均较往年繁荣，其中最突出的是面粉制造业。同一时期，人民银行北京分行也以十四亿二千四百一十八万元的贷款贷给私营工业二千一百十五户，扶助它们克服生产中各种困难。其中一般工业一百七十九户，十亿一千八百零六万元；手工业一千三百三十八户，一亿四千八百七十九万元；特种手工业五百九十八户，二亿五千七百三十三万元。
    在扶植私营工业工作上获得了不小成绩，但也还有某些缺点存在着：一、最初，贸易公司尽最大力量扶植私营工业发展生产，大批收购成品，而某些厂家趁机将其存放数年不易出手的劣货，卖给贸易公司，致长久不能销售，积压了资金。二、某些经济工作人员主观地认为某些行业没有发展前途，因而未能更主动积极地去领导和帮助这些行业改进技术、减低成本，结合其他生产打开销路。三、原料有时供应不够，今后要更好地开辟来源，以达到发展生产的目的。
