    Changzhi Native Produce Company and Supply and Marketing Cooperative Sign Hemp Purchase Contract to Guarantee Government Autumn Grain Collection
    [This dispatch] In order to cooperate with the autumn grain collection and complete the purchase plan, the Changzhi branch of the Handan Native Produce Branch Company signed two contracts with the Changzhi Supply and Marketing Cooperative from the beginning of November to the end of last year, purchasing a large amount of hemp bark and solving the problem of farmers paying public grain. The first contract was signed in early November when prices were rising. Both parties agreed that the company would purchase 315,000 jin of grain from the Grain Company on behalf of the farmers for payment of government public grain. Then, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative would uniformly deliver 50,000 jin of hemp bark to the branch company. The exchange standard at that time was to divide the hemp bark into three grades: first-grade hemp exchanged for 6.5 jin of millet, second-grade hemp exchanged for 6.25 jin of millet, and third-grade hemp exchanged for 5.5 jin of millet, with a guarantee of cleanliness and whiteness. This type of exchange played a significant role in guaranteeing the company's purchase work, and it also partially solved the problem of grain shortage for farmers in mountainous areas where grain was scarce.
    The second time was on December 21st. At that time, Changzhi County was collecting public grain. Because the hemp-producing area farmers lacked grain, the company signed a second exchange contract with the Supply and Marketing Cooperative to help the local government complete the autumn grain collection and to prevent hemp farmers from competing to purchase grain on the market due to the grain shortage, which would affect the rise in grain prices. It was stipulated at that time that the Native Produce Company would hand over 600,000 jin of public grain (corn) to the government. The Native Produce Company entrusted the Grain Company and the Cooperative to purchase this public grain on its behalf, and it would be delivered to the government warehouse by the end of January 1950. The hemp bark from the hemp farmers would be uniformly handed over to the Native Produce Company by the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. The quality of the hemp bark was also divided into three grades: first-grade hemp had a length of 6.5 chi or more, and each jin could be exchanged for 10.75 jin of corn; second-grade hemp had a length of 5.5 chi or more, and each jin could be exchanged for 10.3125 jin of corn; third-grade hemp had a length of 4.5 chi or more, and each jin could be exchanged for 9.1875 jin of corn. First and second grades accounted for the majority, accounting for 90 percent. All conditions were negotiated by both parties, and both parties strictly complied. The following gains were obtained from the two contracts: First, the government's call to plant economic crops was implemented, ensuring reasonable profits for hemp bark and preparing conditions for increased production next year. Second, this combination solved the difficulty for hemp farmers in paying public grain, and it saved labor for other production, which was greatly supported by hemp farmers. Third, state-owned enterprises laid a mass foundation, and the credibility of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative was greatly improved, so that many farmers guaranteed excellent quality when delivering hemp. Some village farmers even competed with each other when delivering hemp, saying: "The Native Produce Company has solved our difficulties; we would feel too bad to deliver poor quality hemp." Fourth, the Native Produce Company's purchasing task was successfully completed, which played a considerable role in controlling grain and stabilizing prices.

    长治土产公司与供销社签订购麻合同保证政府秋征
    【本报讯】邯郸土产分公司长治支公司，为配合秋征，完成收购计划，自去年十一月初到年底曾先后和长治供销社订立两次合同，收购了大批麻皮，并解决农民缴纳公粮困难。第一次合同是在十一月初物价上涨时，双方约定，由该公司代农民向粮食公司购粮米三十一万五千斤，以交政府公粮。然后由供销社统一交支公司麻皮五万斤。当时的交换标准，系把麻皮分为三等，一等麻换小米六斤半，二等麻换小米六斤五两，三等麻换小米五斤十两，并保证质量干净洁白。此种交换对该公司收购工作起着很大保证作用，又因山地缺粮，部分解决了农民的缺粮问题。
    第二次是在十二月二十一日，当时长治县正征收公粮，因产麻区农民缺粮，该公司为帮助地方政府完成秋征，并避免麻农因缺粮而向市场争购，影响粮价上升，又与供销社订立第二次交换合同。当时规定由土产公司交政府公粮（玉米）六十万斤，此项公粮由土产公司委托粮食公司及合作社代购，在一九五○年元月底交到政府仓库。麻农的麻皮则统一由供销社交给土产公司，麻皮质量亦分为三等，一等麻长度在六尺五以上，每斤折玉米十斤十二两，二等麻长度在五尺五以上，折玉米十斤五两，三等麻长度在四尺五以上折玉米九斤三两，其中以一、二等最多占百分之九十。一切条件均由双方商妥，双方严格遵守。从两次合同中得到以下几点收获：一、贯彻了政府号召种植经济作物的政策，保证了麻皮合理利润，给明年增产准备下条件。二、这样结合给麻农解决了缴纳公粮的困难，并节省下劳动力搞其它生产，受到麻农极大拥护。三、国营企业奠下了群众基础，供销社威信大大提高，使许多农民在交麻时都保证质量优良，有些村庄农民在交麻时还互相比赛，说：“土产公司给咱们解决了困难问题，再交次麻太对不起了”。四、使土产公司的收购任务顺利完成，对粮食掌握与稳定物价都起了相当作用。
