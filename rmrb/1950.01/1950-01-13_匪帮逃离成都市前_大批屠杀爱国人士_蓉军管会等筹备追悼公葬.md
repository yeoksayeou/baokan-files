Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 12th. Before the liberation of Chengdu, the Kuomintang gangsters in the city massacred a large number of Communist Party members and other patriotic people. Thirty-five bodies have now been exhumed, and exhumation is continuing. Among the bodies exhumed are Xu Shouzhen, a member of the Chinese Communist Party and Esperanto scholar; Yang Bokai, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and a famous educator in Sichuan; and Wang Ganqing, a local democratic personage. Thirty-two of the victims were taken from prison by Sichuan special agent chief Xu Zhongqi in trucks on the night of December 7, shot near Qingyang Palace outside the city, and the bodies were stuffed into air-raid shelters. The Chengdu Military Control Commission has now formed a post-mortem committee with various democratic parties and the families of the martyrs, and the Military Control Commission has advanced 30 million yuan as funeral expenses. Once the exhumation is completed, a memorial service and public burial will be held.
