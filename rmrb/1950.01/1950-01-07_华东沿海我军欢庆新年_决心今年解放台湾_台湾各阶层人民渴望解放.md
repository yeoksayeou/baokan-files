Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 5th: Troops on the southeast coast are celebrating the New Year with jubilation and high spirits, greeting their battle tasks for 1950. Commanders and fighters on the Fujian and Zhejiang fronts wiped off the mud from their bodies after naval exercises, beat drums, performed the Yangko dance, and celebrated the New Year with coastal residents. A certain battalion on the Zhoushan front returned from suppressing bandits 130 *li* away on New Year's Eve. Without resting, the soldiers enthusiastically rehearsed stilt walking. Commanders and fighters on the coastal defense lines held forums to summarize the past year's victories, strengths, and weaknesses, and eagerly submitted letters of determination to their superiors, pledging to overcome the sea's cold winds, cold water, and any other difficulties, master sea-crossing techniques, and eliminate the remaining enemies on the islands. Various units on the Fujian front also sent New Year's cards to meritorious personnel and held military skills competitions in grenade throwing, blasting, and shooting. Colorful arches were erected everywhere, and bright red Spring Festival couplets expressing the determination to annihilate the enemy were posted. Commanders and fighters of a certain army corps, who are currently engaged in intensive training, became even more motivated after reading the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's letter to the frontline soldiers and the people of the whole country. The chief of staff of the army corps called on everyone to step up preparations and plant the national flag on Taiwan in 1950 during the New Year's Day flag-raising ceremony.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 6th: Taiwan is withering under the dying throes of the Kuomintang remnant bandits. Industry, agriculture, and commerce are generally declining, and the people yearn for liberation. According to statistics from the Machinery Industry Association, one-third of factories are currently shut down, and the rest are in a state of semi-shutdown, with 800,000 workers unemployed. The price of two *jin* of sugar is now equivalent to only one egg. As a result, many sugarcane farmers are reluctantly cutting down sugarcane and planting miscellaneous grains to maintain their livelihoods. More than ten coal mines in Taiwan have closed down due to lack of sales. Fishing boats are restricted from fishing in the outer seas, and merchant ships are also detained for fear that they will defect to the people. These reactionary measures seriously threaten the lives of the majority of the people. At the same time, the Chiang bandits are massively conscripting soldiers in Taiwan to make up for the depletion of their troop sources. According to the pseudo-Taiwan Provincial Civil Affairs Director, physical examinations of 141,000 young men aged twenty and twenty-one in Taiwan were completed last September, and conscription will begin early this year. The bandits are conducting surprise inspections in cities, arbitrarily arresting people and sending them to "guidance camps" for imprisonment. In the army, the so-called mutual guarantee system is also implemented, forcing soldiers to monitor each other. Under such rule and oppression by the bandits, people of all strata in Taiwan yearn for liberation at an early date. At Taoyuan, Banqiao and other stations not far from Taipei, slogans such as "Support Chairman Mao, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!", "Taiwan compatriots, rise up and liberate yourselves!", and "Welcome the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan!" appear from time to time on telephone poles and along railway bridges.

    华东沿海我军欢庆新年
    决心今年解放台湾
    台湾各阶层人民渴望解放
    【新华社南京五日电】华东沿海前线的部队，以欢欣鼓舞的情绪迎接一九五○年的战斗任务来庆祝新年。福建和浙江前线的指战员们，擦掉在海上演习时所沾上的满身污泥，打起锣鼓，扭着秧歌，与海边居民一起欢渡新年。舟山前线某营在除夕黄昏从一百三十里外的某地剿匪归来，战士们没有休息就兴高彩烈地排演高跷。海防线上的指战员们，纷纷召开座谈会总结一年来的胜利，优点和缺点，争着向首长呈递决心书，保证克服海上寒风、冷水和任何困难，学好渡海技术，消灭岛屿上的残敌。福建前线各部，在新年还寄发功臣贺年片，并举行投弹、爆破、射击等军事技术比赛，到处高扎彩门，遍贴表示歼敌决心的大红春联。正在紧张练兵的某兵团指战员接读中共中央的告前线将士和全国同胞书后，愈益奋发。该兵团参谋长在元旦升旗时号召大家加紧准备，在一九五○年中把国旗插到台湾去。
    【新华社福州六日电】台湾在国民党残余匪帮垂死的摧残下，工农商业普遍凋蔽，人民渴望解放。据机器工业公会统计，目前停顿的工厂已达三分之一家，其余也在半停顿状态中，失业工人达八十万人。现在两斤糖的价钱只等于一个鸡蛋。因此不少蔗农忍痛砍断甘蔗，改种杂粮，以维持生活。台湾煤矿因无销路而倒闭者在十处以上。渔船被管制不准到外海捕鱼，商船也被扣留，怕他们投向人民。这些反动措施，严重地威胁着大多数人民的生活。同时蒋匪为弥补其兵源的枯竭，又在台大量征兵，据伪台省民政厅长宣称，台湾二十岁与二十一岁的及龄壮丁，有十四万一千余人体格检查已于去年九月间完成，今年初就要征集。匪帮在城市中则实行突击检查，任意逮捕人民，送入“训导营”监禁。在军队中，也实行所谓连环互保制度，迫令士兵们互相监视。在匪帮这种统治压迫下，台湾各阶层人民无不渴望早日获得解放。在台北市不远的桃园、板桥等车站，电线杆及沿途铁桥上，不时出现“拥护毛主席，活捉蒋介石！”、“台湾同胞起来解放自己！”、“欢迎人民解放军解放台湾！”等标语。
