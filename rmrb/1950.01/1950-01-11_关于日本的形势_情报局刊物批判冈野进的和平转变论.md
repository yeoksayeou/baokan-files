Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 10th: The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy," published in Bucharest on January 6th, carried an article entitled "On the Situation in Japan" written by "Observer," which severely criticized the errors of Nozaka Sanzo (Okano Susumu). The Moscow Pravda also published the same article on January 7th. The full text is as follows:

Following the failure of American imperialism's plundering plans against China and Korea, the U.S. State Department and American militarists have focused their main attention on Japan as a major base for military adventures against the Soviet Union and the democratic movements in Asian countries.

First, they are attempting to delay the signing of a peace treaty with Japan using various absurd excuses, and in this way, to legitimize the long-term occupation of Japan by U.S. forces.

With the help of the American army and Japanese reactionaries, American aggressors are doing their utmost to suppress the democratic movement, crush the Communist Party and trade unions, and make themselves the real masters of Japan. Even now, all of Japan's political and economic life is dominated by American warlords. The Japanese economy is completely subject to American monopoly capital and is being used to serve the aggressive plans of American imperialism. The United States is carrying out extensive construction of air and naval bases on Japanese territory, expanding the arms industry, and rearming the Japanese warlords, turning Japan into a base for military adventures.

MacArthur openly declared when he met with a reporter from the London Daily Mail on March 2, 1949, that the United States had long regarded Japan as a new springboard and had already been working on a considerable scale in this regard.

He went on to say, "I have already built twenty-five airfields on Okinawa, which can guarantee our heaviest bombers 3,500 sorties per day… The Pacific is now an Anglo-Saxon lake..."

Therefore, Japan's political and economic situation is completely determined by the aggressive policy of the United States and the actions taken by the American occupation authorities based on this policy.

The American authorities in Japan are implementing a policy of restoring Japanese imperialism and militarizing Japan. Consequently, with the help of Japanese reactionaries, they are continuously attacking the interests of the Japanese working people, undermining democratic groups, and implementing a large-scale policy of sending spies and agents to infiltrate trade unions and Communist Party organizations.

After seizing Japan's major monopoly enterprises, American capitalists have controlled about 85 percent of the Japanese economy. Japanese capitalists have not lagged behind. Nearly 40 percent of Japan's 1949 budget appropriations were designated to subsidize large monopolies. The taxes paid by this group of Japanese capitalists accounted for only 3.6 percent of national income, while the taxes paid by the Japanese people accounted for 73 percent of national income. The Japanese working people are thus subjected to double exploitation. Despite the American imperialists' attempts to cover themselves with deceptive propaganda, the colonial and militaristic nature of their actions in Japan remains obvious.

The American publication "Pacific Newsweek" declared without concealment that the main goal of the new American plan is to turn Japan into a military-industrial anti-Soviet fortress. The Japanese newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" also expressed satisfaction that "Japan is now on the front line of the anti-communist struggle."

Although the American policy in Japan openly violates the Potsdam Declaration on the democratization and demilitarization of Japan and is a policy of launching a full-scale offensive against the economic and political rights of the Japanese people, the Japanese government fully supports the American colonialization plan. Therefore, the restoration of militarist Japan and the suppression of the democratic movement have long been the common goal and basis of the Japanese reactionaries and the American imperialist bloc.

In addition to this common goal, each participant in this bloc is also trying to realize its own plans. The Japanese reactionaries are using the American capitalists who have vested interests in Japan as allies, relying on them to support the Japanese reactionaries' political influence in Japan; while American imperialism is using the Japanese reactionaries as a tool, with which it is easier to destroy Japanese democratic groups and establish complete political and economic control over Japan, making it easier to turn Japan into a base for military adventures and the Japanese people into cannon fodder.

Under these circumstances, the Japanese working people must have a clear program of action.

Communist organizations, trade unions, and all democratic forces in Japan should unite the working people, expose the foreign imperialists' colonization plans in Japan and the traitorous and anti-people role of the Japanese reactionaries every day. They should wage a resolute struggle for Japan's independence, for the establishment of a democratic and peace-loving Japan, for the immediate conclusion of a fair peace treaty with Japan, for the speedy withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in Japan, and for ensuring lasting peace among all countries.

The leaders of the Japanese working people and the patriots of the people should realize that Japan can only rise and become an independent great power by abandoning imperialism and abandoning the imperialist alliance, by taking the path of democracy and socialism, and by following the line of peaceful development and strengthening peace among all countries. Japan either takes this path—in which case Japan will be saved—or it does not take this path, in which case Japan will be forced to become a tool in the hands of world imperialism, lose its freedom and independence, and be destined to decline.

However, the facts show that the remarks of some leaders of the Japanese Communist Party are not conducive to the successful implementation of these important tasks. They do not understand this program, and they point the Japanese working people, who are in a complex situation in Japan, in the wrong direction.

For example, Nozaka (Okano Susumu), one of the leading figures of the Japanese Communist Party, in analyzing the domestic and foreign political situation in Japan, has tried to prove that post-war Japan possesses all the necessary conditions for a peaceful transition to socialism, even under the occupation system; he even went so far as to insist that this is "the localization of Marxism-Leninism on Japanese soil" (Nozaka's report to the Second Congress of the Japanese Communist Party in January 1947).

As for the occupying army, Nozaka believes that this army is by no means harmful to the purposes of the Japanese Communist Party; on the contrary, in carrying out its mission, it facilitates the democratization of Japan.

"The stationing of the occupying army is aimed at disarming Japan, while at the same time liberating the Japanese people from totalitarian policies, and making Japan a democratic country. The Allied forces' occupation of Japan is not intended to turn Japan into a colony."

According to Nozaka's opinion, even under the occupation system, the Japanese Communist Party can still lead the working class to seize power.

Nozaka declared: "There is already a possibility that the proletariat party can form its own government by winning a majority in parliament and seize power by destroying the bureaucracy and its armed forces. In other words, there is already a possibility of winning power through parliamentary, democratic methods."

In June 1949, Nozaka once again emphasized in his report to the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party that it is entirely possible to establish a people's democratic government under the occupation system without any problems.

"Once such a government is established, the occupying army will withdraw."

Thus, Nozaka even went so far as to utter the bourgeois platitude that Japan can still peacefully go directly to socialism even with the American occupying army in the country. Nozaka has also expressed such views before. For example, in the draft Communist Manifesto he drafted, and later in an article published in the bourgeois newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" in May 1946, Nozaka declared: "With the support of the majority of the people and relying on the people's own efforts, the Party intends to develop the social system into a system that is more perfect than capitalism, that is, into a socialist system, through peaceful and democratic means."

Nozaka believes that the American occupying forces in Japan are playing a so-called progressive role, believing that they are helping Japan along the road to socialism's "peaceful revolution." His views mislead the Japanese people and help foreign imperialists turn Japan into a colonial appendage of foreign imperialism, and transform it into a new center of war in the East.

Nozaka is attempting to invent a "new" theory, which he calls the "localization" of Marxism-Leninism in Japanese conditions. The general idea of this theory is that after the Second World War, conditions for the peaceful development into a socialist country have been created in Japan, and this is happening under the sole rule of foreign imperialist authorities—all this "localization" of Marxism-Leninism is nothing more than a rehash in Japan of the anti-Marxist, anti-socialist "theory" that advocates the peaceful development from reaction to democracy, from imperialism to socialism, a "theory" that has long been exposed and has nothing to do with the working class.

Nozaka's "theory" is a theory that prettifies the imperialist occupation of Japan, a theory that praises American imperialism, and therefore, also a theory that deceives the Japanese masses.

It can be seen that Nozaka's "theory" has nothing in common with Marxism-Leninism. In fact, Nozaka's "theory" is an anti-democratic, anti-socialist theory. It only benefits the imperialist occupiers in Japan and the enemies of Japanese independence. Therefore, Nozaka's "theory" is also an anti-patriotic, anti-Japanese theory.

    关于日本的形势
    情报局刊物批判冈野进的和平转变论
    【新华社北京十日电】一月六日在布加勒斯特出版的共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平、争取人民民主”登载有“观察家”所写的“关于日本的形势”一文，在文中严厉地批评了野坂参三（冈野进）的错误。本月七日莫斯科真理报也发表了同样的文章。其全文如下：
    在美国帝国主义对中国和朝鲜的掠夺计划失败之后，美国国务院和美国军国主义者就集中其主要注意力于日本，作为反对苏联和反对亚洲各国民主运动的军事冒险的主要基地。
    首先，他们企图用种种无稽的借口来拖延对日和约的签订，并且用这种办法来使美军对日长期占领合法化。
    在美国军队和日本反动派的帮助之下，美国侵略者竭力企图镇压民主运动，击溃共产党和工会，并且使自己成为日本的真正国内主人。甚至现在，日本的全部政治和经济生活都受着美国军阀的支配。日本的经济完全受制于美国垄断资本，并且被用以给美国帝国主义的侵略计划服务。美国正在日本领土内的空军和海军基地上进行广泛的建设，扩展军火工业和重新武装日本军阀，它正在使日本变成军事冒险的基地。
    麦克阿瑟在一九四九年三月二日接见伦敦每日邮报记者时公然宣称，美国很早就把日本看作是一个新的跳板，并且已经在这一方面从事于颇大规模的工作。
    他接着又说，我已经在冲绳岛修筑二十五个飞机场，这些飞机场能够保证我们最重型的轰炸机每天进行三千五百次飞行……太平洋现在是盎格鲁萨克逊湖……。
    因而，日本的政治和经济情势就完全为美国的侵略政策以及美国占领当局据此而采取的行动所决定。
    在日本的美国当局实行着恢复日本帝国主义以及使日本军事化的政策，因而就在日本反动派的帮助之下连续不停地进攻日本劳动人民的利益，破坏民主团体，并且大规模地实行派遣间谍和奸细混进工会和共产党组织的政策。
    美国资本家在攫得日本主要的垄断企业之后，已经控制了日本经济约百分之八十五。日本资本家并没有落后。日本一九四九年预算的拨款几乎有百分之四十是指定用来津贴大垄断企业的。日本这一资本家集团所缴的税仅占国家收入的百分之三点六，而日本人民所缴的税则占国家收入的百分之七十三。日本劳动人民就这样受着加倍的剥削。尽管美国帝国主义者企图用欺骗宣传来掩护自己，但是他们在日本的行动的殖民地性质和军国主义性质仍然是显而易见的。
    美国刊物“太平洋新闻周刊”毫不隐讳地宣称：美国新计划的主要目标是在于把日本变成军事工业的反苏堡垒。日本报纸“每日新闻”也对于“日本现在处在反共斗争的前线”表示满意。
    虽然美国在日本的政策公然违背关于日本民主化与非军事化的波茨坦决议，并且是一种对日本人民的经济与政治权利发动全力攻势的政策，然而日本政府却对美国的殖民地化计划给以充分的支持。因之，恢复军国主义日本以及镇压民主运动早就是日本反动派与美国帝国主义者集团的共同目标和基础。
    除了这种共同目标之外，这个集团的每个参与者还在试图实现各自的计划。日本反动派是在利用在日本有利害关系的美国资本家作为同盟者，靠他们来支持日本反动派在日本的政治影响；而美国帝国主义则利用日本反动派作为一种工具，有了这种工具，就更易于摧残日本的民主团体与建立对日本的完全的政治与经济的统治，就更易于使日本变成军事冒险的基地以及使日本人民成为炮灰。
    在这种情况之下，日本劳动人民就必须有一个明确的行动纲领。
    共产党组织、工会和日本一切民主力量应该将劳动人民团结起来，天天不断地揭露外国帝国主义者在日本的殖民地化计划以及日本反动派的卖国和反人民作用。他们应该为日本的独立，为建立一个民主和爱好和平的日本，为立即缔结公平的对日和约，为从速撤退驻日美国军队，为保证各国人民间持久和平而进行坚决的斗争。
    日本劳动人民的领袖们和人民的爱国者们应该认识到：只有摈弃帝国主义和摈弃帝国主义的联盟，只有走民主和社会主义的道路，只有遵循和平发展和加强各国人民间的和平的路线，日本才能兴起并且成为独立的大国。日本或者走这条道路——这样日本就会得救，或者不走这条道路，这样日本将被迫成为世界帝国主义手里的工具，丧失了自由和独立，并且是注定要凋敝的。
    但是，事实说明，日本共产党某些领袖的言论并不在于成功地执行这些重要的任务。他们不了解这个纲领，他们向那些处在日本复杂形势中的日本劳动人民指引错误的方向。
    例如，日本共产党领导人物之一野坂（冈野进）在分析日本国外国内政治形势时曾经力图证明：战后的日本具备着和平转变到社会主义的一切必要条件，即使处在占领制度的条件之下；他还进而硬说：这是“马克思主义——列宁主义在日本国土上的本地化”（野坂一九四七年一月向日本共产党第二次代表会议的报告）。
    至于占领军，野坂认为这种军队对于日本共产党的目的绝无妨害，相反的，在它执行它的使命当中，便利日本的民主化。
    “占领军的留驻是旨在解除日本的武装，同时旨在从极权政策之下解放日本人民，旨在使日本成为民主国家。盟国军队之占领日本并无意于使日本变成殖民地。”
    据野坂的意见，甚至在占领制度的条件之下，日本共产党仍然能够领导工人阶级取得政权。
    野坂声言：“已经有了这种可能性，即无产阶级政党，或者能够经由在议会中赢取多数而成立自己的政府，并经由摧毁官僚机构及其武力而掌握政权。换言之，已经有了经由议会的、民主的方法而赢取政权的可能性”。
    一九四九年六月，野坂在其对日本共产党中央委员会全体会议的报告中再次着重声称，在占领制度的条件下建立一个人民民主政府，毫无问题是完全可能的。
    “这种政府一经建立，占领军便将撤退。”
    于是，野坂竟至于发出资产阶级的滥调说，即使国内有美国占领军，日本仍然可能和平地直接走到社会主义。野坂在以前也曾发表过这样的见解。例如，在他所拟订的共产党宣言草案中，以及后来在一九四六年五月资产阶级报纸“每日新闻”所刊登的一篇文章中，野坂声言：“有着大多数人民的支持和依靠人民自己的努力，党意欲经由和平的民主的方式把社会制度发展为比较资本主义完善的制度，即发展为社会主义制度。”
    野坂认为在日本的美国占领军是起着所谓进步的作用的，认为他们是帮助着日本沿着向社会主义发展的道路而进行的“和平革命”的，他的这种观点迷误日本人民并且帮助外国帝国主义者把日本沦为外国帝国主义的殖民地附庸，变为在东方的新的战争中心。
    野坂企图发明一种“新”的理论，即他之所谓马克思主义列宁主义在日本条件下的“本地化”。这个理论大意是说，在第二次世界大战之后，在日本已经创造了和平发展为社会主义国家的条件，而这是在外国帝国主义当局的单一的统治之下发生的——所有这种马克思主义列宁主义的“本地化”，无非是主张由反动和平发展为民主，由帝国主义和平发展为社会主义的那种反马克思主义的、反社会主义的“理论”在日本的改头换面而已，这种“理论”久已被揭穿，与工人阶级是无缘的。
    野坂的“理论”乃是粉饰帝国主义对日占领的理论，为美国帝国主义吹嘘的理论，因此，也是欺骗日本人民群众的理论。
    可以看到，野坂的“理论”与马克思主义列宁主义毫无任何共同之处。其实，野坂的“理论”乃是反民主、反社会主义的理论。它仅仅有利于在日本的帝国主义占领者和日本独立之敌。因此，野坂的“理论”同时也是一种反爱国主义的，反日本的理论。
