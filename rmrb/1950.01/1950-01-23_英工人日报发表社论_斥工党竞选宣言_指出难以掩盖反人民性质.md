Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 22nd: TASS, London dispatch: The Labour Party leaders published their election platform manifesto on the 18th, entitled "Let Us Pursue Victory Together." In the manifesto, the Labour Party leaders lavishly praised their "achievements" during their five years in power, but carefully concealed from the voters the fact that they had forgotten all the promises they made in their 1945 election manifesto, "Let Us Face the Future." The manifesto is full of fine rhetoric, but it is still easy to see its anti-people nature. The authors of the manifesto also support and praise the aggressive policies of the British and American imperialist bloc.

The editorial of the British Communist Party's newspaper, the *Worker Daily*, pointed out: This manifesto shows that the Labour Party leaders do not believe in the creativity of the British people. What the Labour Party leaders believe in is British big capital, and they are once again calling for increased exports – which is the main point of the Labour Party's election policy. The *Worker Daily* criticized that there is nothing in the Labour Party's manifesto "to inspire the common people and frighten the big capitalists and landlords who are the real masters of Britain." The manifesto fully assures the propertied class that the Labour Party will not touch their control over Britain's resources. Regarding the manifesto's statement of "prosperous cooperation between government, capital, and labor," the *Worker Daily* wrote: "This is the future that the right-wing Labour leaders are fully committed to!" Making a show of nationalizing the small cement and sugar industries cannot hide the fact that it does not touch the large monopolies in shipping, shipbuilding, machinery, chemicals, and other industries. On major issues such as wages, housing, peace, and independence, the platform is a "masterpiece of evasion." The *Worker Daily* pointed out: The manifesto states that "production and purchasing power must go hand in hand," but everyone knows that although production is increasing, purchasing power has been declining. It is truly shameless to say such things at such a time.

The *Worker Daily*, referring to the Labour Party's manifesto's endorsement of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, wrote: As for what benefits the military alliance headed by the United States against the Soviet Union and the colonial peoples has for realizing the peace stipulated in the United Nations Charter, the manifesto does not explain, nor can it explain. Not a word was mentioned about regaining national independence… This document does not offer any practical suggestions on how to prevent the imminent economic decline, maintain wages, guarantee peace and national independence, and it shows a complete lack of faith in the creativity of the British people.

### 英工人日报发表社论  斥工党竞选宣言  指出难以掩盖反人民性质

    英工人日报发表社论
    斥工党竞选宣言
    指出难以掩盖反人民性质
    【新华社北京二十二日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：工党领袖们于十八日发表竞选政纲宣言，题为“让我们一起贯彻胜利”。工党领袖们在宣言中盛赞他们执政五年中的“成绩”，但小心地向选民瞒住一件事实，即是：他们忘光了他们在一九四五年竞选宣言“让我们面对将来”中所作的一切诺言。宣言满篇漂亮辞藻，但仍然不难看出其反人民的性质。宣言的作者还拥护并赞美英美帝国主义集团的侵略政策。
    英国共产党机关报《工人日报》的社论指出：这个宣言表明工党领袖不相信英国人民的创造力。工党领袖相信的是英国的大资本，他们再度号召增加输出——这便是工党竞选政策的要旨。《工人日报》抨击工党的宣言中没有一点“使老百姓感奋而使不列颠实际上的主人大资本家和地主害怕”的东西。该宣言向有产阶级充分保证，工党不会触犯他们对英国富源的控制。关于宣言所说的，“政府资方与工人兴隆合作”一点，《工人日报》写道：“这便是右翼工党领袖们全力以赴的将来！”拿小小的水泥业和糖业国有化做做样子，掩盖不了一件事，就是不去触及航运、造船、机器、化学等工业的大垄断资本，而于工资、房屋、和平、独立等重大问题，则该政纲算得是“规避的杰作”。《工人日报》指出：宣言中说到“生产与购买力必须并驾齐驱”，但是人人都知道，生产尽管增加，购买力却一直在下降。在这样的时候说这样的话，真是厚颜无耻。
    《工人日报》提到工党宣言中赞同侵略性的北大西洋公约时写道：至于以美国为首的反苏和反殖民地人民的军事同盟，究竟对实现联合国宪章所规定的和平有什么好处，该宣言未有说明，也不可能有所说明。关于重获民族独立一点、也只字未提……这个文件对如何防止迫在眉睫的经济衰落、维护工资、保障和平与民族独立，也没有提出任何切实的建议，它表明完全不相信英国老百姓的创造力。
