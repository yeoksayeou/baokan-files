Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 10th (via TASS, Moscow): The organ of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies, Izvestia, recently published an editorial for the upcoming Supreme Soviet elections on March 12th, stating: "From today onwards, our country enters a political movement of great importance for the further development of socialist democracy and the consolidation of the various forces of the Soviet system. In our country, elections are truly free and truly democratic, and all voters—the entire people—actively and consciously participate in the elections. The Soviet people will exercise their right to elect the highest organ of state power in a socialist country, and at the same time, will summarize the results of the activities of their Soviet government in the four years since the last election, and will further strengthen their ranks to achieve new achievements in communist construction."

	As they enter the election campaign, the voters—the working people of urban and rural areas—direct all their thoughts to the ruling party of the Soviet Union, to our great Communist Party. It is the guiding and leading force of Soviet society. Its policy is the foundation of all the historic victories of the people. The Party of Lenin and Stalin leads the people with full confidence to accomplish the ideal goal—to establish a communist society in our country. The Soviet people are working with such vigor and enthusiasm toward this goal.

		Soviet People Will Further Strengthen Their Ranks to Achieve New Achievements in Communist Construction

	The newspaper continued: "Four years ago, in the election of the Second Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, as in previous elections, the voters formed a victorious alliance of Party and non-Party people, united around the election program put forward by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Today, every Soviet patriot will say with deep satisfaction and unwavering loyalty to the Bolshevik Party: This election program has been implemented. Everything the Party of Lenin and Stalin told the people has been realized. The Party has guaranteed the victorious recovery and development of the Soviet national economy in the post-war period. On this basis, the Party organized a further rise in the material and cultural level of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Thanks to the great work accomplished by the Bolshevik Party, the socialist state of workers and peasants is stronger and more invincible than ever before. Its international prestige and international influence, for the lofty purpose of ensuring lasting peace and the security of all nations, has reached an unprecedented height."

		Stalin's Election Speech Four Years Ago Illuminates the Path of Socialist Development

	Izvestia emphasized: "Comrade Stalin's brilliant instructions and the program he put forward for the new development of our country's economic and cultural life have inspired the people's efforts in the four years since the last election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The leader's historic speech to voters on February 9, 1946, illuminated the path of socialist society's development. The people accepted it with great enthusiasm as their program of action."

	After reviewing the great achievements of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the editorial pointed out: "The Soviet Union's remarkable achievements in the post-war period have once again powerfully demonstrated the superiority of the Soviet social and state system, proving the invincibility of our motherland. The Stalinist friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union has guaranteed the prosperity of our motherland and the invincibility of our motherland."

	The Soviet Union steadfastly adheres to a policy of peace. This policy of peace arises from the interests of the socialist system and the Soviet people. Our country does not need to expand outwards, nor does it need colonies. The Soviet people spare no effort to consolidate peace, and they provide an example to all progressive humanity of resolutely struggling for peace, against the instigators of new wars and their open and covert agents. The powerful forces of democracy and socialism are uniting around the Soviet Union. The neighboring countries around our motherland have never treated us as friendly as they do today. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people will continue to strive to strengthen their fraternal ties with the people's democratic countries, consolidate and strengthen the camp of democracy and socialism, for the peace of the world and the security of all nations, and against the imperialist instigators of new wars.

		The Spiritual and Political Unity of the Soviet People is an Invincible Force

	Izvestia concluded: "The Soviet people, with confidence in the victory of their just cause, elect the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, which is closely united around the Communist Party and the Soviet government, around their great leader and teacher Stalin. They are inspired by the great ideals of Marxism-Leninism, by the life-giving Soviet patriotism. Holding high the invincible banner of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, they show the world their spiritual and political unity and their invincible power."

    苏联人民满怀胜利信心
    迎接最高苏维埃选举
    消息报发表社论指出苏联进一步发展
    社会主义民主和巩固苏维埃各种力量
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：劳动人民代表苏维埃的机关报消息报，顷为将于三月十二日举行的苏联最高苏维埃选举发表社论称：从今天开始，我国进入了一个对进一步发展社会主义民主和巩固苏维埃制度各种力量有巨大重要性的政治运动。在我国，选举是真正自由和真正民主的，所有的选民——全体人民都积极地和自觉地参加选举。苏联人民将行使其选举社会主义国家的最高国家权力机关的权利，同时，将总结自己的苏维埃政府自上次选举以来四年中活动的成果，并将更加紧密其队伍，以获得共产主义建设的新成就。
    在进入选举运动时，选民们——城乡的劳动人民们把一切意念都归向于苏联的执政党，归向于我们伟大的共产党。它是苏维埃社会的指导和领导的力量。它的政策是人民的一切历史性胜利的基础。列宁和斯大林的党满怀信心地领导人民来完成理想的目标——在我国建立共产主义社会。苏联人民为此目标，正那样奋发那样热情地工作着。
            苏联人民将更紧密其队伍，以获共产主义建设的新成就
    该报继称：四年以前，在选举苏联第二届最高苏维埃时，像前此的选举一样，选民们组成了党与非党人民的胜利的联盟，一致团结在联共（布）中央委员会所提出的选举纲领的周围。今天，每一个苏联爱国者将怀着对布尔什维克党的深深满足和耿耿忠心说：这一个选举纲领已经实行了。列宁、斯大林党向人民所谈到的每件事都已经实现了。党保证了在战后时期胜利地恢复和发展苏联国民经济。在这一基础上，党组织了工人、农民和知识分子的物质和文化水平的进一步高涨。由于布尔什维克党所完成的巨大工作，工农的社会主义国家已是前所未有地强大和无敌。它为了保证巩固的和平与各民族的安全这一崇高目的的国际威权和国际影响，已达到前所未有的高度。
            斯大林四年前选举演说照明社会主义发展道路
    消息报着重指出：斯大林同志英明的指示以及他为了我国经济和文化生活的新发展所提出的纲领，鼓舞了人民在上次选举苏联最高苏维埃以来的四年中的努力。领袖在一九四六年二月九日向选民发表的历史性演说，照明了社会主义社会发展的道路。人民以巨大的热情接受它作为自己的行动纲领。
    社论评述实行战后五年计划的伟大成就后指出：苏联在战后的卓越成就，又一次强有力地证明了苏维埃社会制度与国家制度的优越性，证明了我们的祖国的不可被战胜。苏联各族人民的斯大林的友谊，已保证了我们祖国的繁荣，保证了我们祖国的不可被战胜。
    苏联坚稳地遵循着和平政策。这个和平政策就是在社会主义制度与苏联人民的利益的基础上产生的。我们的国家并不需要向外扩张，不需要殖民地。苏联人民不遗余力地巩固和平，他们向全体进步人类提供了为和平、为反对新战争挑拨者及他们的公开和暗藏的代理人而进行坚决斗争的范例。强大的民主与社会主义的力量，正团结在苏联的周围。我们祖国四周的邻邦，从来不曾像今天这样友好地对待我们。苏联人民在共产党的领导下，将继续为加强其与人民民主国家的兄弟般的联系、巩固和加强民主与社会主义阵营、为全世界的和平与各民族的安全、为反对帝国主义的新战争挑拨者而奋斗。
            苏联人民在精神上政治上的团结是不可战胜的力量
    消息报结语称：苏联人民怀着对他们的正义事业的胜利的信心，来选举紧密地团结在共产党与苏维埃政府周围、团结在他们伟大的领袖与导师斯大林周围的苏联最高苏维埃。他们为马列主义的伟大理想、为给人们以生命力的苏维埃爱国主义所鼓舞。他们高举列宁、斯大林党的不可战胜的旗帜，向全世界显示他们在精神上、政治上的团结和他们不可战胜的威力。
