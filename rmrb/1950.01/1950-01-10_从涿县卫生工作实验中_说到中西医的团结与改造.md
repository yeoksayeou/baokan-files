From the Health Work Experiment in Zhuoxian County: On the Unity and Transformation of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine
Zhuoxian County Medical and Epidemic Prevention Team

On September 27, 1949, the Medical and Epidemic Prevention Team, under the leadership of the former North China People's Government Health Department, began working in the Zhuoxian County health experimental zone. After two months of practical work and investigation, it put forward some suggestions on organizing rural epidemic prevention, hygiene, health care, medical treatment, etc. Excerpts of these are provided below for the reference of rural health organizers and health workers.

I. Our Team's Diagnosis and Treatment Situation:

1.  Consultation situation: Statistics from two fixed consultation locations and mobile consultations: A total of 4,644 consultations were conducted in two months, with an additional 216 acupuncture treatments. Approximately 60% of the consultations were initial visits. Seasonally, digestive system diseases were most prevalent in October, while surgical and dermatological diseases were most numerous in November. The detailed classification of diseases is shown in the following statistical table:

2.  Medical Efficacy: The most significant results were seen in ophthalmology, surgery, and dermatology (e.g., Zhang Kunzhi of Changcun Village, whose back abscess was quickly cured with penicillin injections; Li Ming of Fangshu Pass, whose head wound was quickly stitched up, both cases were considered miraculous). Among infectious diseases, the treatment of kala-azar (black fever) garnered the most trust from the masses. The successful rescue of a case of uterine rupture after difficult labor attracted the attention of nearby villages. Acupuncture had a certain effect on long-term neuralgia and paralysis. For example, a woman from Beihengqi, who had been unable to leave her bed for three years, was gradually able to put down her crutches and walk on the ground after seven acupuncture treatments. The treatment of toothaches, headaches, and stomachaches all yielded certain results.

3.  Fee Collection: We charged the original cost of the medicine plus 20% (because we prepared a 20% reduction/exemption, which would balance the income and expenses). Later, due to soaring prices, we increased the medicine prices by 2.5 to 3 times when changing regions. Staff members paid for medication at the standard price, but could receive a 50% discount according to regulations. From the beginning to the end of November, the income should have been 744,055 yuan. After paying 270,630 yuan to the medicine supply department, there was a remaining balance of 433,555 yuan. In addition, 20,650 yuan was reduced or exempted for local cadres, and 19,220 yuan was reduced or exempted for the general public, totaling 39,870 yuan, accounting for approximately 5.4% of the total income. The average charge per consultation was 160 yuan.

II. Disease Overview in Zhuoxian County:

Zhuoxian County has not experienced any serious disease epidemics in the past three years. Although measles and smallpox occurred this spring, they were not severe, and the mortality rate was relatively low. Digestive disorders and dysentery were more common in the spring, summer, and autumn. Local areas near the mountains in the Eighth District had endemic diseases, such as goiter, which, according to our survey of five typical villages, affected an average of 7.8% of the population. Trachoma was severe in rural areas, affecting an average of over 70% of healthy individuals. Examination of 623 people for roundworm eggs revealed that approximately 80% had worm eggs. According to local traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, gynecological diseases were quite common, accounting for slightly less than half of the consultations. Although we also saw such cases in our team's consultations, we did not continue treatment because it was impossible to cure them in a short period of time.

III. General Situation of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine:

There were a total of 151 traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners in the three districts, of which 131 (87%) were traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and 20 (13%) were Western medicine practitioners. Most of the traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were trained as apprentices or through self-study. Most of the Western medicine practitioners were also trained as apprentices in private clinics, with only a few having received some formal training (an average of one doctor for every 589 people). Their general skills were considered average in rural areas.

Statistical Table of Practicing Doctors in the Eighth, Seventh, and Third Districts of Zhuoxian County

| District | Population | Doctors | TCM | Western | One doctor per how many people? |
| :------- | :--------- | :------ | :-- | :------ | :------------------------------ |
| 8        | 33,748     | 59      | 53  | 6       | 572                                 |
| 7        | 31,080     | 56      | 45  | 11      | 585                                 |
| 3        | 24,165     | 36      | 33  | 3       | 671                                 |
| Total    | 88,994     | 151     | 131 | 20      | 589                                 |

The general impression of the farmers towards doctors is not very good, mainly because they charge too much money and have a big attitude. When asked to make house calls, they first go to the homes with good livestock. When they arrive at the patient's home, they must be provided with high-quality meals (eight or six bowls) before they will provide proper medical care. Therefore, the masses do not seek medical treatment unless absolutely necessary, but once they call a doctor, they do not know how much money they will have to spend. This creates a situation in rural areas where the vast majority of poor laborers have no money to see a doctor when they are sick and can only wait for the illness to resolve itself. Although it is said to be better than before, local traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners claim that they treat patients based on the principle of "the rich pay, the poor get treated." In reality, there are not that many rich patients in rural areas, so the poor have to pay a higher price to seek medical treatment.

According to local traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, the price of regular medicine is not high (three or four sheng per dose), but according to patients, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners often charge six sheng of corn for a plaster (for treating kala-azar), while Western medicine practitioners have charged one and a half dou of corn for three anti-inflammatory pills, and at least three sheng for fifteen tiles of Glauber's salt. In the Seventh District, Western medicine practitioner Dr. Shen charged seven shi of corn for a transverse fetal craniotomy, which shows a glimpse of the charges.

Local Western medicine practitioners often prescribe traditional Chinese medicine for internal medicine patients. According to traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioner Mr. Cui: "Prescribing traditional Chinese medicine looks like a big package, which allows me to charge more money, and the patient doesn't feel it's expensive. If I prescribe Western medicine, it's just pills or powder, a small amount, and if I charge a little more, the patient thinks it's too expensive. So, I have to learn some traditional Chinese medicine formulas to cater to the patient's psychology. In reality, traditional Chinese medicine may not be effective, but there's nothing I can do." This is a typical view of the general traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners in rural areas.

IV. How to Solve the Rural Medical Problem:

Given the current situation of a lack of medical personnel and equipment in rural areas, the only way to remedy this is to approach it from two aspects. One is to determine that the local health and medical construction work should no longer be solely focused on hospitals that only admit patients, but should adopt mobile outreach to villages, or establish branch clinics in large towns, focusing on seeing more outpatient or house call patients. This will first eliminate the view that county hospitals are set up solely to provide recuperation for county and district cadres. Currently, Zhuoxian County Medical Cooperative alone has three doctors (including the director), two nurses, one pharmacist, and one cook, a total of seven people, but there are only three cadres hospitalized for recuperation, and they only see more than 30 outpatients per day, mainly cadres. It is called a medical cooperative, but in reality, it is a hospital with wards and an operating room. Sometimes, patients are referred from other places, but they are either afraid of too many people increasing the workload, or afraid that the medicine will run out and cannot be replenished. Therefore, we feel that although the former North China People's Government Health Department had instructed county hospitals to face the masses, in reality, this was not done at the grassroots level. This is a fundamental issue concerning the direction of future medical facilities and must be corrected.

Another aspect is to organize medical associations to transform the thinking of these doctors who are heavily influenced by old social habits, so that they turn to serving the broad masses of working people. Of course, this requires a relatively long process. Based on the experience of the Eighth, Seventh, and Third Districts, the district medical association can still play a certain role. In particular, the Seventh District is better than the other two districts. There are still many difficulties in the transformation process, such as their "guaranteed cure" habits, but generally, people recognize that organizing a medical association is beneficial to them. Therefore, as long as we can grasp this point, on the one hand, we should provide them with practical and needed knowledge in terms of technology, such as the usage and indications of procaine, how various diseases are transmitted, the morphology of worm eggs and bacteria (under a microscope), and explain kala-azar based on real cases to arouse their interest. On the other hand, we should tell them more about the qualities that people's medical workers should have, the differences between now and the past, and propose a firm opposition to formalistic consultation systems that shirk responsibility. We should also discuss how to serve the rural working people in the future. Through such organization, constantly raising the demand for the integration of politics and technology, assigning them certain tasks, strictly supervising, inspecting, and reporting, and regularly participating in their group meetings, they are gradually changing.

    ２，医疗效果的情况：收效最显著者为眼科、外科、皮肤科疾病（如常村张坤之背部臃肿注射盘尼西林，房树关立明砍破头之缝合均迅速治愈，认为惊奇）。传染病系中以治黑热病最得群众信仰。难产后子宫破裂之救治一例，引起附近各村的注意。针炙对多年之神经痛瘫痪，均引起一定之成效，如北横岐一妇女已三年不能下炕，经七次针炙后即能逐渐放下拐杖，下地行走。对牙痛、头痛、胃痛的治疗，都收到一定效果。
    ３，收费情况：我们按照药材科发来原价加百分之二十（因准备有百分之二十减免费，有此即可收支相抵），以后因物价飞涨，在更换地区时酌增二·五倍——三倍药价。工作人员吃药一律收费，但可按规定价格减收一半。自开始至十一月底，应收入七四四，○五五元，除已交药材科二七○，六三○元外，尚存四三三，五五五元。另有地方干部减免费二○，六五○元，一般减免费一九，二二○元，共三九，八七○元，约占全收入之百分之五、四。每次诊病，平均收费一百六十元。
    二、涿县疾病概况：涿县在最近三年来并无较严重之疾病流行，今春麻疹天花虽有，但不严重，死亡也较少，春夏秋三季患消化不良及痢疾者较多。当地八区近山一带有地方性病，甲状腺肿，根据我们五个典型村调查，平均占人口之百分之七·八。农村砂眼严重，健康人中平均约占百分之七十以上。蛔虫卵检查六百二十三人，其中有虫卵者约占百分之八十以上。妇科疾病据当地开业之中医谈为数相当不少，约占诊病人数之半弱。但在本队诊疗中，亦均见过，因无法在短期内根治，均未继续治疗。
    三、中西医的一般情况：三个区共有中西医一百五十一人，其中中医占一百三十一人（百分之八十七），西医占二十人（百分之十三）中医均为相随中医学徒或自修出身，西医也多半自私人诊所学徒出身者，只有个别少数的曾经受过一定训练者（平均每五八九人口中有一个医生）一般技术在农村说来尚算中等。
        涿县八、七、三区开业医生统计区别        人口数       区别        人口数        医生                多少人里有一个医生
                        计      中    西８    ３３．７４８    ５９    ５３    ６            ５７２７    ３１．０８０    ５６    ４５  １１            ５８５３    ２４．１６５    ３６    ３３    ３            ６７１计    ８８．９９４  １５１  １３１  ２０            ５８９
   一般农民对医生的批评不太好，主要的由于要的钱多，架子大，请出诊时，看谁家的牲口好先去谁家，到了病家必须准备上等饭菜（八碗或六碗）才给好好看病，因此群众非到迫不得已时，不去治病，但一请先生则不知要用多少钱，这样造成农村广大贫苦的劳动人民是有病无钱医，只好等待病自然变化的现象。目前虽然说比以前好一些，但是据当地中西医表示，他们是本着“富者拿钱，穷汉治病”的原则来治病的。事实上农村中没有那么多的有病富汉，所以穷汉也只有出较多的代价来求医。
    据当地中西医说一般平常药价不高（三、四升一付药），但根据病人反映，中医往往有一贴膏药达六升玉米的（治黑热病的膏药），西医开三片消炎片，曾经要过一斗半玉米，十五瓦泻盐起码也是三升。七区有西医沈大夫作横位碎胎术一次，即收七石玉米，可见收费一斑。
    此地西医看内科病人多半开中药，据中西医崔先生说：“开中药看起来一大包，多要一些钱，病家也不觉得贵，如给西药，则非药片即药粉，数量很少，要价稍多，病家嫌贵，所以只好学一些中药方来迎合病人心理，实际上中药不见得有效，但也无法。”这是农村一般中西医思想观点的典型之一种。
    四、怎样解决农村医药问题：针对这种农村现实缺乏医药人员设备的情况，只有从两方面来进行补救，一个即确定地方卫生的医疗建设工作，不应该再是专办收容病人的医院性质了，而应采取巡回下乡，或在大的村镇设分诊所，以多看门诊或出诊病人为主，这样就先消除县立医院是专为解决县区干部疗养而设的观点。目前单就涿县县立医药社来说，有医生三人（主任在内）护士两人，司药一人，炊事员一人，共七人，但只有三个干部住院疗养，每天只看门诊三十多人，而且还是以干部为主，名为药社，实际是医院性质，有病房，有手术室，有时由别处介绍病人前往，他门或怕人太多了增加工作负担，或怕把药吃完无法补充，因此我们感到过去华北人民政府卫生部虽曾指示过县立医院应面向群众，但实际上，下边没有做到，这是有关今后医药设施的方针基本问题，必须设法纠正。
    另一个即是组织医联会，改造这些旧社会习气严重的医生思想，使他们转向为广大劳动人民服务，当然这是需要一个较长时间的过程，根据八、七、三，三个区的经验，区医联会还是能起到一定作用的。尤其是七区比其他两区更好一些，在改造的过程中还有不少的困难，如他们的“包治”习惯，但一般的人都还认识组织医联会是对自己有好处的。所以只要我们能抓住这一点，一方面在技术上多给他们介绍实际需要的知识，如?胺的使用法及适应症，各种疾病是怎样传染的，虫卵病菌形态（显微镜下）根据实在病例讲解黑热病等等，引起了他们的兴趣。另外再多给他们讲人民医务工作者应具有那些条件，现在与过去不同的地方，提出坚决反对形式主义的互相推诿责任的会诊制度，今后要怎样为农村劳动人民服务。经过这样的组织，经常不断的提出政治与技术结合的要求，并给他们布置了一定的工作，严格督促检查汇报，经常参加他们的小组会，因此他们是逐渐在转变着。
