    New Year Greetings to Chairman Mao
    Guo Moruo
    This afternoon, in the council hall of the Government Administration Council, I read a telegram,
    From the workers of the Fushun Mining Bureau's Electrical and Mechanical Plant, sending New Year greetings to Chairman Mao. —
    Dear Chairman Mao, we want to tell you some good news,
    We have already exceeded the 1949 production plan.
    The original plan for alloy, cast iron, cast steel, and forgings was 2590 tons,
    By the end of November, we had produced 3382 tons, and by the end of the year it will reach 3742 tons.
    The original plan for repairing motors and transformers was 609 units,
    We have already repaired 1235 units, and by the end of the year it will reach 1330 units.
    385 coal drills have been repaired, and by the end of the year it will reach 410 units.
    (This item did not have a planned number in the original telegram, perhaps it was outside the plan.)
    We have newly manufactured 3 50-horsepower motors, 35 35-horsepower motors;
    We have newly manufactured 10 10-horsepower fans, and 60 0.5-horsepower electric drills.
    Dear Chairman Mao, you have led us so diligently, we thank you,
    We offer these production figures to you as New Year greetings for 1950. —
    This, I feel, is undoubtedly a masterpiece poem of 1949;
    Copy it out and ask the people's poets to evaluate it, see if it is?
                                (January 5, 1950)

### 向毛主席拜年

    向毛主席拜年
    郭沫若
    今天下午，我在政务院的议事厅读了一通电报，
    是抚顺矿务局机电厂的工友们向毛主席拜年。——
    亲爱的毛主席，我们要告诉你一个好消息，
    我们把１９４９年度的生产计划早已经超过了。
    合金、铸铁、铸钢、锻造等本来预定的是２５９０吨，
    十一月尾已经产生了３３８２吨，年底可到３７４２吨。
    马达变压器的修理本来预定的是６０９台，
    已经修理了１２３５台，年底可到１３３０台。
    煤钻已经修理了３８５台，年底可到４１０台。
    （这一项原电中没有预定台数，或许是在计划之外。）
    新造了５０马力马达３台，３５马力马达３５台；
    新造了１０马力扇风机１０台，０．５马力电钻６０台。
    亲爱的毛主席，你领导得太辛苦，我们多谢你，
    就以这些生产数字来向你拜１９５０年的新年。——
    这，我感觉着毫无疑问是１９４９年的一首压卷的好诗；
    抄出来请人民诗人们评价一下，看是不是？
                                （１９５０年１月５日）
