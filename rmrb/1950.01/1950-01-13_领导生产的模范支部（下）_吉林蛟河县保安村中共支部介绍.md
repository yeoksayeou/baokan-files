    Strict and substantial organizational life ensures the unity and initiative of Party members.

    In addition, the branch has grasped the central task of production. After the land reform, they focused all their efforts on leading production. All the branch's activities revolved around production work as the main content, and they educated Party members to guide the masses to use their accumulated wealth for production. Most of the villagers' savings were used to buy carts and horses. In the year and a half from March of last year to September of this year, 97 poor peasant households in the village bought 51 horses and 10 carts (including 4 rubber-tired carts), 18 middle peasant households bought 8 horses and 3 carts (including 1 rubber-tired cart), 3 landlord households and 9 rich peasant households bought 8 horses and 1 rubber-tired cart. They plan to buy 6 more rubber-tired carts after this year's autumn harvest.

    The branch used a strict organizational life system, the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and democratic leadership methods to ensure the unity and initiative of Party members. They held branch committee and group meetings every ten days and a branch general meeting every half-month. Since opening the Party to the public last year, they have consistently maintained this meeting system. In the Party's various meetings, in addition to democratic discussion of each task, they can also engage in frank and sincere ideological criticism. This allows each Party member to regularly receive the work assigned by the Party and to promptly discover and correct their shortcomings, so that Party members can always maintain consistent action in thought and work.

    The branch has core cadres: Branch Secretary Han En is a farmer from a poor peasant background who is proficient in agricultural labor and good at managing sideline occupations. He can come up with detailed production plans according to the seasonal environment, manpower, and animal power. He has great motivating and persuasive abilities for Party members and the masses, so he can get Party members and the masses to actively and voluntarily complete each production plan. He himself can take out all possible time to participate in practical labor. His labor skills, management ability, and production intensity are unmatched by ordinary people. Therefore, since 1947, he has been honored as a first-class labor model in the county for three consecutive years, which has further strengthened his practicality in leading the masses in production. He is active in his work, fair in his dealings, and diligent in his studies (he was illiterate in the past but can now understand the Worker-Peasant Daily and "The New Countryside"), so Party members and the masses support him very much. His problem is that he is impatient and not patient enough, but because the masses have figured out his temperament, they can forgive him.

    Important conditions for forming a model branch: core cadres; strong leadership from the county and district.

    The county and district have strong leadership over the branch, and the higher authorities regularly provide them with political and ideological education and practical work assistance. Six people, including the branch committee members and group leaders, have received training in the county Party training class, where they received some basic Party education. Branch Secretary Han En is also a well-known labor hero in the province. He often goes to the county or province to attend meetings. In the summer of 1949, he was selected as a representative to attend the Northeast People's Representative Conference, so he was able to receive direct education from some higher-level agencies. These trained Party members and Han En would convene Party members and continuously explain what they had learned whenever they returned home from training or meetings. Because Party members are regularly educated, they show high political enthusiasm, are willing to learn and progress, and can understand the Party's basic knowledge and policies.

            New Atmosphere in the Countryside

    The new atmosphere in the countryside is that the entire village is enveloped in a production atmosphere. It is truly "few idle people in the countryside during the day, and the sound of carts and horses can still be heard in the middle of the night."

    In the past three years, under the active leadership of the branch, the village has completely changed its past face and presented a new atmosphere of a new democratic society. We can see the basic features of this new atmosphere from the following figures: The village had a total of 198 hectares of land in 1947, and now it has increased to 235.7 hectares, reclaiming 37.7 hectares; the amount of fertilizer applied was 1,455 carts in 1947, and this year it increased to 8,350 carts. Income (all converted to corn bushels as a unit of price): agricultural income in 1947 was 972 bushels, sideline income was 386 bushels, for a total of 1,358 bushels; agricultural income in 1948 was 1,757 bushels, sideline income was 1,239 bushels, for a total of 2,996 bushels; and in 1949, agricultural income was 1,076 bushels, sideline income was 1,456 bushels, for a total of 2,532 bushels. Class changes: The original 32 tenant farmer households have now become 13 poor peasant households, 17 middle peasant households, and 2 well-to-do middle peasant households. The original 65 poor peasant households have now become 38 middle peasant households and 7 well-to-do middle peasant households. The original 12 landlord and rich peasant households now have a living standard equivalent to 5 poor peasant households, 6 middle peasant households, and 1 well-to-do middle peasant household. Of the original 18 middle peasant households, 12 are still middle peasant households and 6 are well-to-do middle peasant households. In terms of culture, in 1947, one child of a poor peasant, three children of middle peasants, and five children of landlords and rich peasants went to school. In 1949, the numbers were 55, 15, and 18, respectively.

    From the above figures, we can see that in the past three years, the village has seen rapid and widespread growth in agricultural cultivation, sideline business, actual income, and cultural education (only the agricultural income in 1949 was lower than in 1948 due to drought). The main reason is that the branch implemented the Party's policy of production and construction and the policy of organizing the masses, and the broad masses, under the correct leadership of the branch, were swept into a production upsurge. This production upsurge is not only manifested in a certain busy farming season, but throughout the year. In early September 1949, when the farm work was just finished, it was the off-season, but it was impossible to find idle people in the village during the day. Men, women, old, and young, all who could work went to haul wood, cut yellow grass, pick wild grapes, pile up manure, pull rice paddies, and thatch houses. They left before dawn and did not return until midnight. It was truly "few idle people in the countryside during the day, and the sound of carts and horses can still be heard in the middle of the night."

    The entire village is enveloped in a production atmosphere, which is the new atmosphere. Because everyone is focused on production and rationally organized for production, there are very few fights and quarrels among the villagers. The feudal clan phenomena formed among the masses, which were exploited by landlords and rich peasants in the past, have been eliminated. This enables village cadres to spend all their time leading the masses in production and engaging in individual production. The villagers' requests are, first, that state farms can cultivate some good seeds and sell them to them, and second, that the government buy some foreign horses and foreign pigs and set up insemination stations so as to increase agricultural income and improve livestock. This village is not a perfect branch, and it has the following shortcomings:

            Current shortcomings

    The shortcomings are: unclear division of Party and government responsibilities; insufficient listening to the opinions of the masses; and unclear ideas among Party members regarding production.

    (1) In terms of leadership, the division of Party and government responsibilities is not clear. The branch replaces the village government, and the village chairman has low prestige. Most of the work is discussed by the branch and passed on by the branch general meeting, and then directly conveyed to the masses by Party members. Because most of the Party members serve as village cadres, they participate in Party meetings in the capacity of Party members and then convey the work to the masses in the capacity of administrative cadres. The village government rarely holds representative meetings, so non-Party village representatives rarely attend meetings. At the same time, it forms a situation where Party members lead the masses in the position of administrative cadres more often than they lead by persuasion and education. This, on the one hand, reduces the democratic role of the masses to some extent, and on the other hand, it forms a situation where Party members do not have enough in-depth understanding of the masses to help them solve individual specific difficulties, especially for those farmers who lack management skills.

    (2) Since the Party was opened to the public in November 1948, Party meetings have rarely absorbed the participation of the masses, so the leadership of the branch Party has not been able to directly combine with the masses. Therefore, whenever the branch finishes a meeting, the masses sometimes cannot wait for the Party members to convey the information and ask: "What did your branch discuss again? Did you come up with a good way to increase production?" This shows that the masses support the branch's leadership in production on the one hand, and on the other hand, it also proves that the masses still think that what the Party members say counts.

    (3) Party members have contradictory ideas about production. On the one hand, they are unwilling to leave production for fear of losing work and not being able to live well. For example, in the autumn of 1949, the county transferred two Party members to receive training and work in the cooperative. The Party members were unwilling to go, and they reluctantly went after a lot of persuasion. On the other hand, they do not have a clear understanding of the direction of the cooperative, so the wealth increased in production has not been better used as capital accumulation to expand reproduction, and some Party members have spent it all.

    领导生产的模范支部（下）
    吉林蛟河县保安村中共支部介绍
    严格而充实的组织生活，保证了党员的团结和积极性。
    此外，支部并掌握了生产为主的工作中心。土地改革后，他们全力集中于领导生产，支部的一切活动都是以生产工作为主要内容，并且教育党员引导群众，将所积累的财力运用到生产上。该村群众所积蓄的余钱多半买了车马。从去年三月到今年九月一年半的过程，全村雇贫农九十七户买进马五十一匹，大车十台（内有胶皮车四台），十八户中农买进马八匹，大车三台（内有胶皮车一台），三户地主，九户富农，买进马八匹，胶皮车一台，今年秋收后他们还计划买六台胶皮车。
    支部运用了严格的组织生活制度，和批评与自我批评的武器及民主领导方法，保障了党员的团结和积极性。他们是十天一次支委会与小组会，半月一次支部大会，从去年公开党后他们就经常的坚持了这种会议制度，在党的各种会议上，除民主讨论每件工作外，并能展开坦率诚恳的思想批评，这样就使得每个党员经常的接受到党所分配的工作，和及时的发现与改正自己的缺点，因此党员在思想上，工作上都能经常保持一致的行动。
    支部有核心干部：支书韩恩是贫农出身的、精通农业劳作与善于经营副业的勤朴农民，他能够按照季节环境人力畜力的情况，想出周密生产计划，他对党员与群众很有鼓动说服能力，因此他能够把每一个生产计划使党员与群众去积极自愿的完成，他自己又能抽出一切可能的时间，参加实际劳动，他的劳作技术与经营能力生产强度是一般人所赶不上的，因此从一九四七年起，他三年连获全县一等劳动模范的光荣称号，这便更加强了他对领导群众生产的实际性。他工作积极，办事公正，学习努力（过去不识字现能看懂工农报与《新农村》），所以党员与群众都很拥护他。他的毛病就是性急，不够耐心，但因为群众都摸上了他的脾气，所以也能原谅他。
    形成模范支部的重要条件：有核心干部；县区领导较强。
    县区对该支部领导较强，上级对他们经常的有政治思想教育和实际工作的帮助。支委与小组长等六人都到县党训班受过训练，他们得到了些党的基本教育，支书韩恩又是全省驰名的劳动英雄，他经常到县上或省上去开会，一九四九年夏天被选为代表参加东北人民代表会议，因之他能够得到一些高级机关的直接教育，这些受训的党员和韩恩每当受训或开会回家后就召集党员，连续讲解他所学得的东西。由于党员经常得教育所以表现政治热情高，愿学习，愿进步，且能懂得党的基本知识和政策。
            农村新气象
    农村新气象，就是全村笼罩着生产空气。这里真是“白昼农村闲人少，夜半尚闻车马声”。
    三年来该村在支部的积极领导下，完全改变了过去的面目，呈献出了新民主主义社会的农村新气象。我们可以从这样的几个数字中看出这种新气象的基本面貌：全村一九四七年时共有一百九十八垧地，现在已增到二百三十五垧七亩，开荒三十七垧七亩；施肥一九四七年共一千四百五十五车，今年增到八千三百五十车。收入（都按价折合苞米石数为单位）一九四七年农业收入九百七十二石、副业收入三百八十六石，共一千三百五十八石；一九四八年农业收入一千七百五十七石、副业收入一千二百三十九石，共二千九百九十六石；至一九四九年农业收入一千零七十六石、副业收入一千四百五十六石，共二千五百三十二石。阶级变化：原雇农三十二户，现变为贫农十三户，中农十七户，富裕中农二户。原贫农六十五户，现变为中农三十八户，富裕中农七户。原地富十二户，现在生活水平相当于贫农的五户、中农六户、富裕中农一户。原中农十八户，现仍为中农的十二户，富裕中农六户。在文化上一九四七年就学儿童贫雇农一人，中农三人，地富五人，一九四九年贫雇农五十五人，中农十五人，地主富农十八人。
    从以上几个数字中，我们可以看出该村三年来无论在农业耕作，副业经营与实际收入，及文化教育上，都是迅速普遍的上升（仅是因一九四九年天旱农业收入比一九四八年减少），主要原因是支部贯彻了党的生产建设的方针和组织起来的政策，广大群众在支部的正确领导之下卷入了生产热潮，这种生产热潮并不仅表现于某一农忙季节，而是表现于一年四季。一九四九年九月初正是挂锄农闲时，白天村里找不到闲着的人，男人、女人、老的、少的，凡是能劳动的人都去搞拉木头、割黄草、采野葡萄、堆土粪、拔稻稗、苫房子等生产，且都是未明即去，半夜始归，真是“白昼农村闲人少，夜半尚闻车马声”。
    全村被生产空气笼罩着，这就是新气象。正因大家专力于生产，又是合理的组织起来生产，所以该村群众闲打架吵嘴的事很少，过去被地主、富农所利用的在群众中形成的封建宗派现象已经消除，这便能使村干部拿出全部的时间来领导群众生产和进行个人生产。这村群众的要求，一是国家农场能培养些优良的种子卖给他们，一是希望政府买些洋马，洋猪，设配种站，以便能增加农业收入和改良牲畜。该村并不是十全十美的支部，它还有如下的缺点：
            现在的缺点
    缺点是：党政分工不明；倾听群众意见不够；党员在生产上，思想还有不明确处。
    （一）在领导上党政分工不明，支部代替村政，村主席威信不高，绝大多数工作都是支部讨论，支部大会传达通过，而后由党员向群众直接传达。因为党员大部分都担任屯里干部，他们以党员的资格参加党的会议，而后又以行政干部的身份向群众传达工作，村政很少开代表会，因此非党员的屯代表很少参加会议，同时也形成党员对群众以行政干部地位领导的多，而以说服教育的方法领导少，这便一方面在某种程度上降低了群众性的民主作用，另一方面便形成党员深入了解群众帮助群众解决个人的具体困难不够，特别是对那些缺乏经营智力的农民具体帮助更不够。
    （二）从一九四八年十一月公开党后，党的会议很少吸收群众参加，因此形成支部党的领导尚未能直接与群众结合，故每当支部开完会时群众有的等不及党员的传达，就问：“你们支部又讨论什么事，是不是又合计出生产上的好办法”？这说明群众一方面拥护支部生产上的领导，另一方面也证明群众思想上还是认为党员说了算。
    （三）党员在生产上存在着矛盾思想，一方面不愿脱离生产怕误工自己过不好，如一九四九年秋县上调到两个党员受训脱离生产任合作社工作，党员都不愿去，后经很大说服才勉强的去了；另一方面对合作社的方向认识还不明确，因而生产增加的财富未能更好的作为资金积累扩大再生产，有的党员把它都消费了。（续完）
