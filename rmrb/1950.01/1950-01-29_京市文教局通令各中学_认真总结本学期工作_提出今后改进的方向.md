Beijing Municipal Bureau of Education Issues Circular to All Middle Schools

Conscientiously Summarize This Semester's Work
Propose Directions for Future Improvement

[Beijing News] In order to summarize the experience of secondary education work this semester and propose directions for future work improvements, the Municipal Bureau of Education of the Municipal Government previously issued an outline for summarizing the work of this semester to public and private secondary schools in the city, instructing all schools to summarize past work in accordance with the outline. At present, most schools have begun to organize representatives from faculty, staff, students, and workers to widely solicit opinions on school leadership and the work of various departments through informal talks, forums, and discussions, or to conduct reviews separately according to the nature of the problems (such as grade-level work, the teacher-specialist system, the relationship between the student union and administration, etc.). Preliminary inspections by the Bureau of Education have revealed that some schools do not understand the meaning and spirit of "work summary" and therefore do not attach importance to it. Some schools have used the excuse of being busy "preparing" for student exams and have no time to consider it; others believe that this work is only related to key faculty and staff and that general staff do not need to participate, resulting in only a few administrative personnel simply dividing the work according to the outline, working behind closed doors, and "rushing to write materials." Still other schools only convene a few administrative heads for a brief discussion according to the outline, with the teaching affairs office and the general affairs office holding one meeting each. The principal neither attends nor cares about the important materials presented by the staff, does not analyze or study major issues, and only focuses on "how to finish writing," holding the old view and style of handing in the paper on time. In order to correct this deviation, the Bureau of Education yesterday (the 28th) re-instructed all schools to conduct serious inspections and reminded those schools that have not yet paid attention to this work to promptly correct their misunderstanding of this work in order to complete the task well.

    京市文教局通令各中学
    认真总结本学期工作
    提出今后改进的方向
    【北京讯】市政府文教局为了总结本学期中等教育工作经验，提出今后工作的改进方向，前曾向本市公私立中等学校发出本学期工作总结提纲，令各校依照提纲总结过去工作。现各校多已着手组织教职员、学生、工友代表会，通过漫谈、座谈、讨论等方式，广泛征求对学校领导及各部门工作的意见，或按问题性质（如级任工作，教员专任制，学生会与行政关系等）分别进行检讨。这一工作，经文教局初步检查结果，发现还有部分学校不了解“工作总结”的意义与精神，因之没有重视。有的借口忙于“准备”学生考试，无暇顾及；有的认为这一工作只与主要教职员有关，一般职员不必要参加，以致发生只由几个行政负责人员按照提纲简单分工，闭门造车，分头“赶写材料”的现象。也有的学校只召集几个行政负责人按照提纲简单交谈一下，由教导处、总务处座谈一次，校长既不出席，对职员们提出的重要材料也漠不关心，对重大问题不加分析研究，只着重“如何写完”，抱着如期交卷的旧观点、旧作风。为了纠正这个偏向，文教局于昨（二十八）日再度指示各校认真进行检查，并提醒尚未重视这一工作的各校，及时改正对这工作的错误认识，以便很好地完成任务。
