    Tianjin's Cooperative Undertakings Over the Past Year
    Kang Weizhong
            I. Achievements
    Tianjin's cooperative undertakings were established based on the urgent demands of the masses and the active efforts of cooperative cadres, following the principle of "factories first, then citizens; public ownership first, then private ownership." From mid-February to the end of November, a total of 302 consumer cooperatives were established in factories, government offices, and schools, with 496,495 members and shares worth 1,861,854 jin of millet; 146 citizen cooperatives were established, with 524,577 members and shares worth 575,094 jin of millet. In addition, a carpet supply and marketing cooperative was organized, with 556 male and female workers participating, as well as a cotton weaving production cooperative and twenty-seven cotton weaving production groups, with nearly 1,000 cotton weaving machines and a total of 1,184 workers and apprentices.
    The Tianjin General Supply and Marketing Cooperative's business operations are mainly focused on grain. Over the past year (excluding December's statistics), it sold a total of 31,348,514 jin of coarse grains and 27,989,596 jin of fine grains. In terms of price, coarse grains were approximately 10% lower than the wholesale price, and fine grains were approximately 5% lower than the wholesale price. According to November's statistics alone, this saved cooperative members over 1.9 billion yuan. Secondly, for cotton cloth, non-staple food, and daily necessities, the total supply to cooperative members over the past year amounted to 3,549,365,630 yuan. Since the selling price was slightly lower than the market price, November's savings for members alone reached over 17 million yuan. This not only eliminated excessive intermediate exploitation for the working people and saved them expenses, but also avoided the serious impact of price fluctuations caused by competing for goods in the market.
    In terms of organizing and leading urban handicrafts and independent producers, since July, the carpet supply and marketing cooperative has produced a total of 15,768 square feet of male-made carpets and 49,100 square feet of female-made carpets, earning a large amount of foreign exchange. The cotton weaving production cooperative and production groups produced a total of 26,688 bolts of plain cloth, 101,093 bolts of plain twill cloth, 19,326 dozens of towels, and 1,670 dozens of socks. Under the leadership of the General Cooperative, the members of each production cooperative and group not only maintained and stabilized their lives through production, relieving the pain of unemployment, but also achieved certain successes in restoring and developing urban handicraft production.
            II. Reasons for Success
    How did Tianjin's cooperative undertakings achieve these successes?
    1. Tianjin has historically been an excellent market for unscrupulous merchants to engage in speculation and profiteering. Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, every time wages were paid, prices would rise in cycles, led by grain and cloth, making it impossible to guarantee the lives of the working people. After liberation, the General Cooperative controlled large quantities of grain, cloth, and other daily necessities, providing them to cooperative members at low prices, so that the vast majority of members truly benefited from the cooperative, and therefore the cooperative was supported by the masses and achieved rapid development and growth.
    2. Emphasis was placed on relying on the working class during the establishment of cooperatives. Following the principle of "factories first, then citizens; public ownership first, then private ownership," consumer cooperatives were vigorously organized, ensuring the lives of the working people, and thus there was a broad mass base.
    3. The close connection between the cooperative and state-owned trade, and the strong support it received. The North China Grain Company allocated 10 jin of fine grains and 20 jin of coarse grains to cooperative members each month, basically ensuring the food needs of the members. In addition to preferential prices, the company provided convenience by allowing five to ten days of credit to accommodate the difficulty of capital turnover for factory workers and cooperative members. In addition, state-owned enterprises signed consignment contracts with the General Cooperative to ensure the supply of non-staple food and daily necessities needed by the vast number of consumer cooperative members, generally at prices 3% or 5% lower than the market price; at the same time, the cooperative could also obtain a 3% commission. State-owned specialized companies provided raw materials, promoted product sales, or provided support for their development in the form of processing to various production cooperatives or production groups. For example, as of the end of November, the North China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company had loaned 678 bales of yarn and exchanged 22,230 bolts of cloth. The Fur and Leather Company signed a processing contract with the Carpet Cooperative for a total of 13,146 square feet of male and female carpets.
    4. The support of the state bank is also another major condition for directly expanding the cooperative's business. Over the past year, in addition to handling the deposit, loan, and remittance businesses of the cooperative and establishing relationships with 187 cooperatives, the Cooperative Department of the Tianjin People's Bank has loaned 6,920 bundles of cotton yarn to cotton weaving production groups in the city and more than 20 million yuan to the Carpet Cooperative, ensuring the supply of raw materials for production and the turnover of funds.
    5. The close interconnections between fraternal cooperatives in the liberated areas. Through the cooperative freight yard, the General Cooperative purchased grain and other non-staple food from cooperatives in various places to adjust the supply and demand of consumer cooperative members in the city; on the other hand, it also promoted the sales of products from production cooperatives in the city to cooperatives in various places to open up broad sales channels. According to November's statistics, the value of grain purchased by the freight yard was 118,281,635 yuan, and the value of daily necessities was 6.25 million yuan. At the same time, in November and December, it promoted the sale of more than 10,000 bolts of cloth for production cooperatives.
            III. Existing Problems
    However, the following problems still exist in Tianjin's cooperative's current business operations and deserve attention and resolution.
    (1) In general, factory, government office, and school consumer cooperatives lack management cadres and funds, which directly affects the development of cooperative business. From the investigation of sixteen cooperatives in seven, eight, and nine districts of the city, eight cooperatives do not have cadres who are detached from production. A more serious example is the private Yizhong Tobacco Company, which has more than 7,000 members, but none of the five cooperative cadres are detached from production. At the same time, each cooperative lacks working capital. Generally, members only pay two jin of corn flour as shares, and some cooperatives have no shares at all. For example, the Huabei Electrical Machinery General Factory Electrical Machinery Factory Cooperative stopped operating all non-staple food and daily necessities from August due to limited funds, and cannot meet the needs of its members.
    (2) Although it has been decided that each factory cooperative should be under the dual leadership of the General Cooperative and the factory trade union, deviations often occur in the implementation, either forming trade union monopoly or the cooperative becoming independent, and the relationship between the two parties is often uncoordinated, which greatly hinders the development of business.

    天津市一年来的合作事业
    康伟中
            一、成绩
    天津市的合作事业，是在群众急迫要求与合作社干部积极努力的基础上，本着先工厂后市民先公营后私营的原则建立的。从二月中旬至十一月底，共建立工厂、机关、学校消费合作社共三○二个，社员四九六，四九五人，股金折小米一，八六一，八五四斤；市民合作社一四六个，社员五二四，五七七人，股金折小米五七五，○九四斤；另外组织了地毯供销合作社，计参加男女工人五百五十六个工人，棉织生产合作社和二十七个棉织生产小组，有棉织机近一千台，工人学徒共一一八四人。
    天津市供销总社的业务经营以粮食为主，一年来（缺十二月份的统计）共售出粗粮三一，三四八，五一四斤，细粮二七，九八九，五九六斤，在价格上粗粮约低于批发价百分之十，细粮约低于批发价百分之五。仅十一月份的统计，为消费社员节省十九亿之多。其次纱布，副食品和日用品等，一年来共供给社员合三，五四九，三六五，六三○元，由于售价均较市价略低，据十一月统计，为社员节省即达一千七百余万元之巨。这不仅为劳动人民免除了超额的中间剥削，节省了开支，而且避免了因在市场争购物资而刺激物价波动的严重影响。
    合作社在组织和领导城市手工业和独立生产者方面，自七月份开始，所组织的地毯供销社，共出产成品计男工地毯一五，七六八方尺，女工地毯四九，一○○方尺，争取了大量的外汇进口。棉织生产社和生产小组，计产白市布二六，六八八匹，白斜纹布一○一，○九三匹，织毛巾一九，三二六打，袜子一，六七○打。在总社的领导下，各生产社和小组的社员不仅从生产中维持和安定了自己的生活，解除了失业的痛苦，而且在恢复与发展城市的手工业生产上也获得了一定的成绩。
            二、获得成绩的原因
    天津合作事业是怎样获得这些成绩呢？
    一、天津市历来是奸商投机倒把的绝好市场，在国民党反动派统治时，每逢发薪，物价即以粮布带头形成周期性的上涨，致使劳动人民生活没有保证。解放后，合作总社掌握了大量粮布及其他日用品，低价充分供给社员的需要，使广大社员真正受到合作社的实惠，因此合作社受到群众拥护，获得迅速发展和成长。
    二、建社中强调依靠工人阶级。以先工厂后市民，先公营后私营的方针，大力组织消费社，保障了劳动人民的生活，因而有广大的群众基础。
    三、合作社与国营贸易密切的联系，并得到有力的扶植。华北粮食公司每月配售社员细粮十斤，粗粮二十斤，基本上保证了社员食粮之需求。除价格优待外，公司为照顾工厂职工社员资金周转困难，曾规定赊欠五天至十天予以方便。此外，各国营企业为保证广大消费社员的副食品及日用品的需要，纷纷与合作总社订立代销合同，一般较市价低于百分之三或五；同时合作社还可获得百分之三的手续费。各国营专业公司对各生产社或生产小组，多方予以原料供给，成品推销或以代加工的方式大力的扶植其发展。如华北花纱布公司截至十一月底共贷纱六七八件，换布二二二三○匹。皮毛公司与地毯社订立代加工合同计男女地毯共一三，一四六方尺。
    四、国家银行的扶植，也是直接扩大合作社业务的另一主要条件。一年来津市人民银行合作部除办理合作社存、放、汇兑等业务，与一百八十七个社建立来往关系外，计贷给本市棉织生产组六九二○捆棉纱，贷给地毯社资金二千余万元，保证了生产原料之供给和资金之周转。
    五、各解放区兄弟合作社的相互密切联系。总社通过合作货栈一方面收购各地合作社的粮食及其他副食品，调剂本市消费社员的供需；另方面又将本市生产社所出之成品推销给各地合作社，以打开广阔的销路。据十一月份的统计，货栈代购粮食总值一一八，二八一，六三五元，日用品六百二十五万元，同时在十一、十二两月代生产社推销布一万余匹。
            三、目前存在的问题
    但是天津合作社在目前开展业务中仍存在以下几个问题值得注意和解决。
    （一）在工厂、机关、学校消费社中一般缺乏经营干部和资金，直接影响了合作社业务的开展。从本市七、八、九三个区十六个社的调查中，有八个社没有脱离生产的干部，比较严重的如私营颐中烟草公司，有社员七千多人，五个社干部中，没有一个人脱离生产。同时各社又乏缺周转资金，一般的社员仅缴二斤玉米面做股金，有的社根本就没有股金。如华北电机总厂电机工厂合作社，由于资金所限，从八月份开始，即停止一切副食品和日用品的经营，不能满足社员需要。
    （二）各工厂合作社虽曾决定受合作总社与该厂工会的双重领导，但在执行中却经常发生偏向，不是形成工会包办，就是合作社闹独立性，两方关系常不协调，使业务开展受到极大障碍。
