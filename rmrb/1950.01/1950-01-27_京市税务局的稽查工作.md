The Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau's several regular tax collections have shown a significant increase in revenue during the nine months from the beginning of the rectification in April of last year (February and March were mainly takeover work) to the end of December. Taking stamp tax, business tax, and liquor tax as examples, the stamp tax revenue in April was equivalent to only 360,000 jin of rice, but reached over 1.65 million jin in December, an increase of more than three and a half times; the business tax in April was 242,000 jin, and in December it was 1,023,000 jin, an increase of more than three times; the liquor tax revenue in April was 631,000 jin, and in December it was 1,453,000 jin, also more than double. This shows that Beijing's industry and commerce have initially recovered since liberation, and also indicates that the rectification of Beijing's tax work has achieved initial results.

The rectification process of Beijing's tax work proves that establishing and strengthening the tax department's inspection work is a crucial key.

In newly liberated large cities, the main characteristics of tax work are the broad scope of assessment, the complexity of the burden objects, and the tax staff's insufficient understanding of the situation. In particular, due to the long-term rule of enemy puppets and Kuomintang bureaucratic institutions, most industrialists and merchants have become accustomed to tax evasion and avoidance, and some even have rich experience in this. After liberation, this old style cannot be quickly changed. Therefore, after the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau initially completed the takeover work in April last year, it immediately established an Inspection Section to be responsible for uniformly enforcing all tax violation cases, including smuggling inspections and case handling.

At the beginning of the work, the Inspection Section had only a dozen cadres, and they were not familiar with the city's situation and various tax businesses. Therefore, initially, they started with controlling key points – the city gates. Each tax sub-bureau set up inspection posts or stations at various large and small city gates to inspect all incoming and outgoing goods, which played a considerable role. At the same time, they selected key points in the city to begin preparations for comprehensive control. However, controlling the city gates had the disadvantage of affecting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. By the end of June, according to the government's instructions, the method of city gate inspection was quickly abolished altogether.

In the half-year of groping forward after this, the main work of the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau's Inspection Section was to assist the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce in gradually organizing various trading markets, effectively managing the markets, and opening up tax sources; and to jointly organize the East Station Joint Unified Inspection Station with the Tianjin Railway Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and the Disciplinary Corps. In June, September, and December, they conducted planned and focused surprise inspections of various taxes, which achieved significant results and increased tax revenue. In addition, they cooperated with the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the People's Bank of China in two major inspections of hoarding materials, which played a certain role in stabilizing the two Beijing price fluctuations in August and November. Due to the development and needs of the work, each tax sub-bureau has now also established an Inspection Section.

The primary purpose of inspection work is to ensure the completion of tax revenue tasks. But this does not mean that the tax revenue tasks should rely on fines from discovered violations, but rather to educate merchants through inspection work. Therefore, when the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau discovers violations, it first explains the government's tax policies and educates them, promoting their conscientiousness. In terms of punishment, different treatments are given according to different circumstances. For example, in the nine months of last year, the Municipal Tax Bureau investigated and dealt with a total of 18,461 violation cases, and the proceeds from confiscated goods converted to rice were over 62,000 jin, and fines were over 820,000 jin. The sum of these two items only accounted for 0.92% of the total tax revenue last year, which is an extremely small amount. However, the corresponding effect on tax revenue caused by educating merchants through inspection work is extremely large. For example, after the surprise inspection in August, Beijing's liquor tax revenue also increased from over 190,000 jin of rice in June to over 620,000 jin in August; another example is that the goods tax revenue was over 920,000 jin of rice in September, and decreased to 770,000 jin in November. After the Tax Bureau inspected the old stock of taxable goods and registered and paid supplementary taxes, the revenue in December reached 1,690,000 jin.

Of course, the Beijing inspection work, which is being carried out through exploration, still has shortcomings, and the behavior of merchants evading and avoiding taxes still significantly affects tax revenue. First of all, the inspection work has not yet been professionalized. Last year, only a few surprise inspections were conducted, and they were all carried out after the seasonal tax collection. This means that the inspection work cannot fully strive for initiative and prevent tax evasion. Secondly, since the scope of urban tax assessment is so large, it is obviously not enough to rely solely on tax work cadres to carry out inspections. The past nine months of work have also shown that the role played by cases solved due to mass tip-offs is very significant. Therefore, how to further strengthen close ties with the masses and the ways of contact should be studied. The Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau has prepared to gradually solve these problems in its work plan for 1950.

    京市税务局的稽查工作
    于谷
    北京市人民政府税务局几项经常税收，自去年四月份开始整顿（二、三月份主要是接管工作），至去年十二月底止，九个月来，收入已有显著增加。以印花税、行商税、酒税来看，印花税四月份收入折米仅三十六万斤，十二月份达一百六十五万余斤，增加三倍半强；行商税四月份二十四万二千余斤，十二月份一百零二万三千余斤，增加三倍多；酒税四月份收入六十三万一千余斤，十二月份收入一百四十五万三千余斤，也增加了一倍多。这说明解放以来京市工商业已初步恢复，也说明京市税收工作的整顿，已获得初步成绩。
    京市税收工作整顿过程证明，建立与加强税务部门的稽查工作，是一个重要的关键。
    在刚解放的大城市中，税收工作的主要特点是课征面广，负担对象复杂，税收工作人员对情况了解还不够充分，特别是由于敌伪与国民党官僚机构的长期统治，使一般工商业者已习惯于漏税逃税，且部分对此还有丰富的经验。解放后这种旧的作风，还不可能很快转变过来。因此，京市税务局于去年四月间接管工作初步完成后，立即设立稽查科，负责统一执行所有税务违章案件之缉私检查及案件处理等工作。
    工作开始时，稽查科只有十几个干部，而且对城市情况和各种税收业务都不熟悉。因此，最初是先由掌握点——城门——做起，由各税务分局在各大小城门分别设立检查所或检查站，对出入货物一概进行检查，起了相当作用；同时，在市内选择重点；开始全面掌握的准备工作。控制城门却发生了影响城乡物资交流的缺点，至六月底，根据政府的指示，很快便一律取消了城门检查的办法。
    在此后摸索前进的半年中，京市税务局稽查科主要进行的工作，是协助市工商局逐步组织各种交易市场，有效地管理市场，开辟税源；与天津铁路局、公安局、纠察总队等，共同组织东站联合统一检查站。在六月、九月、十二月有计划、有重点的进行了各项税收的突击检查工作，收到了显著效果，增加了税收收入。另外，并配合了工商局、人民银行两次大检查囤积物资的工作，对平稳八月、十一月两次京市物价波动，起了一定的作用。因工作的开展与需要，现在各税务分局也都建立了稽查课。
    稽查工作的首要目的，是保证税收任务的完成。但这决不等于说，税收任务要依仗查获违章案件的罚金来解决，而是要通过稽查工作教育商人，所以京市税务局在查获违章案件时，首先是解释政府的税收政策，对其进行教育，促其自觉。在处分上，也是分别不同的情况予以不同的对待。如市税务局去年九个月中，共查获处理违章案件共一万八千四百六十一件，没收品变价折米六万二千余斤，罚金八十二万余斤，两项合计只占去年税收总额的千分之九点二，数目是极小的。但通过稽查工作教育商人，在税收收入上相应而起的效果却是极大的，如八月份突击检查后，京市酒税收入也自六月份的折米十九万余斤，增至八月份的六十二万余斤；再如货物税收入九月份折米九十二万余斤，十一月份降至七十七万余斤，经税务局检查旧存应纳税货物、登记补税后，十二月份收入达一百六十九万余斤。
    当然，在摸索中进行着的京市稽查工作，还是有缺点的，商人漏税、逃税的行为还相当影响税收收入。首先是稽查工作还未专业化，去年只进行过几次突击检查，而且都是在季节性税收征收之后进行的。这也就使稽查工作还不能充分争取主动，预防漏税。其次，城市税收课征面既这样大，光靠税收工作干部来进行稽查，显然是不够的，而过去九个月工作也说明，因群众告密而破获案件所起的作用很大，因此，如何进一步加强与群众密切联系以及联系的方式，是应该研究的。这些问题，京市税务局在一九五○年工作计划中，已准备逐步予以解决。
