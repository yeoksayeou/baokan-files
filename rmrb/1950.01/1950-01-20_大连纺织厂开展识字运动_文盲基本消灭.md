[From our Northeast correspondent] Since the Dalian Textile Factory launched its literacy campaign in April of last year, illiteracy has been basically eliminated in less than a year. Before April, the illiteracy rate among workers was over 60 percent. Now, the average worker can recognize at least 200-300 characters; some workers can recognize over 1,200 characters and are able to read ordinary newspapers and documents.

When the campaign started, the mobilization meeting began by encouraging workers to talk about the pain of being illiterate. This made the general worker very eager to become literate. More than 90 percent of workers joined the literacy classes led by the trade union and were very active in their studies. However, around August and September, the enthusiasm for learning gradually declined. The trade union immediately conducted an in-depth investigation and found problems such as the separation of learning from production, the fact that trade union cadres were serving as teachers and were unable to meet the students' needs, and inappropriate class arrangements. In response to these problems, the following specific solutions were devised:

First, class schedules were adjusted. Classes were arranged according to the number of characters each person knew, with different levels of classes. Each class established a group with a group leader, a class head, and a hired principal. Various learning systems were established, the class head and group leader had clear divisions of labor, and a regular reporting system was established, gradually transforming the literacy classes into regular worker spare-time supplementary schools. Second, in solving the textbook problem, the best technical workers reported their working methods at technical worker forums, and the content of the reports was compiled into teaching materials, so that workers not only recognized characters but also learned technology in the process of learning. In addition, cultural textbooks for each class were compiled based on the specific situation of the factory, solving the problem of learning being separated from production. To solve the problem of teachers, a "little teacher" teaching method was adopted, selecting workers with higher levels of literacy and certain working abilities from among the workers, and specifically leading them through the trade union's cultural and educational department, cultivating them as "little teachers." They were given political lessons two or three times a week and provided with self-study books. As a result, the enthusiasm of work cadres, teachers, and students was greatly enhanced.

In October, the factory responded to the call of the Lüda area to launch a literacy and model creation campaign, initiating competitions and challenging each other. Specific conditions for literacy models were also defined. The conditions for model students were: 1. Abide by learning time and learning system, and consistently actively participate in collective learning. 2. Be good at using spare time to study, with an average test score of 95 or above. 3. Be able to frequently help and promote others to learn, and be able to persuade three workers to participate in learning during the model creation period. 4. Be good at both learning and production. After 40 days of the model creation campaign, the original learning plans of each class were improved. For example, the original plan for the first half of the first year was to recognize 150 characters, which was increased to 250 or 400 characters during the campaign. As a result of the campaign, a total of 102 literacy models emerged, of which 62 were female workers. Cai Zhengfeng, a 48-year-old female worker, also surpassed the young people and became a literacy model.

In summarizing the work of the literacy campaign, the factory has come to several conclusions: 1. The Party, government, and trade union leaders of the factory must regard leading learning as one of their regular tasks, and must promptly correct deviations and solve problems. 2. Establish a teaching system to make learning organizations become regularized. 3. The specific difficulties of female workers should be resolved as much as possible. The factory did not have a nursery for female workers with children. The factory family dormitories tried to give female workers with children rooms, so that they could get rid of the entanglement of family chores outside of work and be able to spare time to study. Therefore, female workers generally made rapid progress in the literacy campaign.

### 大连纺织厂开展识字运动  文盲基本消灭

    大连纺织厂开展识字运动
    文盲基本消灭
    【本报东北讯】大连纺织厂自去年四月开展识字运动以来，不到一年的时间，基本上已消灭文盲。四月以前，工人中文盲占百分之六十以上，现在一般工人，最少已能识二、三百字；一部分工人识字一千二百以上，已能阅读普通报纸、文件。
    运动开始时，因在动员大会上从启发工人诉说不识字的痛苦入手，一般工人要求识字很迫切，百分之九十以上的工人参加了工会领导的工人识字班，学习非常积极。但至八、九月间，学习情绪逐渐低落。工会当即进行深入检查，发现学习与生产脱节、教员由工会干部兼任不能满足学生要求、编班不恰当等问题。针对这些问题，研究出以下的具体解决办法。
    首先是进行调整班次，依据每人认字的多少编成不同程度的班次，各班建立小组，设小组长，班主任，聘请了校长。规定了各种学习制度，班主任小组长有明确分工，并建立了定期汇报制度，使识字班逐渐变成正规化的工人业余补习学校。其次，在解决教材问题上，由工作最好的技术工人在技术工人座谈会上报告其工作方法，将报告内容编成教材，使工友在学习中认了字也学习了技术；并结合本厂具体情况编出各班的文化课本，解决了学习与生产脱节的问题。对解决教员问题，则采用了小先生制的教学方法，从工友中选择文化较高并有一定的工作能力者，由工会文教部具体领导，培养为小先生。每周给他们上二、三次政治课，并发给自学书籍。于是，工作干部、教员、学员的情绪都大为提高。
    十月间，该厂响应了旅大地区开展识字创模运动的号召，发起竞赛，互相挑战。并具体定出识字模范条件。模范学员的条件为：一、遵守学习时间、学习制度，一贯积极参加集体学习。二、善于利用工余时间进行学习，测验平均九十五分以上。三、能经常帮助、推动别人学习，创模期内能说服三名工友参加学习。四、学习好生产也好。经过四十天的创模运动，各班原订的学习计划都提高了一步。如一年级上半期原计划识一百五十字，运动中提高到二百五十字或四百字。运动结果，一共涌现出识字模范一百零二名，其中女工占六十二名。一位四十八岁的女工蔡正凤也超过年青人当了识字模范。
    该厂在总结识字运动工作中，得出数点经验：一、工厂的党、政、工会领导必须把领导学习当作经常工作之一，并须及时纠正偏向，解决问题。二、建立教学制度，使学习组织走向正规化。三、对女工的具体困难应尽可能解决。该厂对有小孩的女工没有托儿所，厂内家属宿舍尽量给有孩子的女工住，使她们工作之外，摆脱家庭琐事的纠缠，能抽出时间学习，所以识字运动中，女工普遍的进步很快。
