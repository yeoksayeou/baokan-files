Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 17th: TASS Moscow dispatch: Izvestia published on the 15th an international commentary on the Indonesian people's struggle for national independence, stating: More than two months have passed since the deal between the pro-American Hatta-Sukarno clique, who sold out the Indonesian people, and the Dutch colonialists was finalized at the Hague "Round Table" Conference.

The first few steps taken by the so-called Hatta-Sukarno "government" after the Hague deal confirmed that this clique was ready to sell its soul to its true master—US imperialism. Hatta stated on January 3 that one of the primary issues his cabinet would consider was obtaining loans from the United States. At the same time, "President" Sukarno also urged foreign capitalists to invest in the Indonesian economy. It wasn’t long before this received an appropriate response. US Ambassador to Jakarta (i.e., Batavia), Cochran, declared that the United States was drafting a broad plan for economic "aid" to Indonesia. Some of the largest American companies are planning to open branches in Indonesia.

The US representative, Cochran, the stage manager of the "Round Table" Conference who operates in Indonesia under the guise of the US ambassador, is now supervising the affairs of the Hatta-Sukarno puppet "government" behind the scenes. To deal with the rising liberation movement in Indonesia, US imperialism hopes to use the Dutch armed forces and the reactionary Hatta-Sukarno clique. Sukarno’s recent statement that the Dutch colonial army will be merged into the armed forces of the "United States of Indonesia" should be viewed from this perspective. In other words, the Hatta army will be placed under the absolute control of the Dutch command.

The false "self-determination" that the Indonesian government obtained in The Hague has failed to deceive the Indonesian people, who are waging a struggle for genuine independence. News from Indonesia proves that neither the Hatta-proclaimed "government" nor the Dutch army can control the situation in Indonesia. Indonesian patriots are responding to Hatta’s treacherous deal with the Dutch and US imperialists by strengthening their armed struggle. The colonial army is blockaded in nearly twenty of Indonesia’s largest cities. Fierce battles continue in Java. The strike movement by the Indonesian working people to protest the unbearable living conditions created by the Dutch and US imperialists has become increasingly strong.

The growing national liberation movement is causing disintegration in the camp of Indonesian bourgeois nationalists. In Java, the Darul Islam Islamic organization has risen up against the Hatta "government." Resentment in the puppet army is rising, and some puppet army officers and soldiers have joined the resistance movement.

The Indonesian people are waging a struggle for national freedom and independence, firmly believing that their just cause will ultimately be victorious if they persevere in the long term.

    坚决反对美帝哈达的卖国交易
    印尼人民加强武装斗争
    消息报评论印尼形势发展
    【新华社北京十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报十五日刊载印尼人民为争取民族独立而斗争的国际述评称：自从出卖印尼人民的亲美的哈达——苏加诺集团与荷兰殖民者之间的交易在海牙“圆桌”会议上订成明文以来，已经过去了两个多月。
    所谓的哈达——苏加诺“政府”，在海牙的交易之后所采取的最初几个步骤证实，这个集团已准备将灵魂出卖给它们的真正主子——美帝国主义。哈达于一月三日声称：他的内阁首先考虑的问题之一，是从美国获得贷款。同时，“总统”苏加诺也力促外国资本家在印尼的经济方面投资。这之后没有多久，就得到了适当的反响。美国驻雅加达（即巴达维亚）大使柯契伦宣称：美国已在拟订经济上“援助”印尼的广泛计划。美国一些最大的公司，正打算在印尼开办分公司。
    以美国大使的身份在印尼活动的“圆桌”会议的舞台监督——美国代表柯契伦，现正在幕后监督哈达——苏加诺傀儡“政府”的事务。为了对付印尼国内日益高涨的解放运动，美国帝国主义指望利用荷兰武装部队与反动的哈达——苏加诺集团。苏加诺最近关于荷兰殖民军将合并到“印尼合众国”的武装部队中的声明，是应当从这个角度来看的。换句话说，即是哈达军队将被置于荷兰指挥部的绝对控制之下。
    印尼政府在海牙所得到的虚伪的“自决”，并没有能够欺骗印尼人民，他们正在进行争取真正独立的斗争。来自印尼的消息证明：无论是哈达自封自命的“政府”或荷兰军队，都不能控制印尼国内的情势。印尼爱国分子正在以加强武装斗争来回答哈达与荷、美帝国主义者的卖国交易。殖民军被封锁在将近二十个印尼最大的城市里。激战仍在爪哇继续进行。印尼劳动人民为抗议由荷、美帝国主义者所造成的不能忍受的生活条件而进行的罢工运动，已愈来愈强。
    日益增长的民族解放运动，引起印尼资产阶级民族主义者阵营的分崩离析。在爪哇，达鲁尔·伊斯兰回教组织已起而反对哈达“政府”。傀儡军部队中的愤懑，正在日益上涨，已有若干傀儡军官兵参加到抵抗运动方面。
    印尼人民正在进行争取国家自由和独立的斗争，他们坚信长期坚持下去，他们的正义事业终必获得胜利。
