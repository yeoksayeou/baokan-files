Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 2nd:
    The full opening of the Jinghan and Yuehan Railways on New Year's Day symbolizes the complete unification of mainland China and the great future of the new China's construction endeavors.

    The opening of the Jinghan and Yuehan Railways enables direct railway transportation from Manzhouli on the northern border of China to Guangzhou at the southern end of the country. It also connects the railway lines of the Northeast, North China, East China, Central South, and Northwest major administrative regions into one. This is of great significance for strengthening the exchange of materials, political, military, and cultural ties between the North and the South, overcoming the country's post-war difficulties, and promoting economic recovery and construction work.

    The rapid restoration and opening of the two major railways in a short period, along with the over-planned completion of more than 8,200 kilometers of railway construction in 1949, fully demonstrates that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, are not only capable of overthrowing the rule of imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, but also capable of rapidly building an independent and prosperous country and creating a happy and fulfilling life. The joint operation of the Jinghan and Yuehan Railways has been interrupted for twelve years. During the eight years of occupation of mainland China, Japanese imperialism made every effort to open them to facilitate its war of aggression and the sucking of materials, but the result was failure. In the four years after the Kuomintang reactionary government took over, it not only proved incapable of repairing them, but also carried out frantic destruction during its collapse. Only the Chinese People's Government, in 1949, when the large-scale civil war was still raging fiercely, restored the two major railways with a total length of 2,596 kilometers behind the People's Liberation Army's victorious advance. What an astonishing achievement! The Kuomintang bandit gang constantly boasted about so-called "guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines," attempting to disrupt social order and hinder the people's construction efforts through sabotage activities by bandits and secret agents. The restoration and opening of the two major railways proves the complete bankruptcy of their so-called "guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines" and proves that under the iron fist of the Chinese people, these secret agents and bandits will be quickly wiped out, and there is no possibility of forming any "guerrilla warfare."

    The rapid restoration of the Jinghan, Yuehan, and many other railways, in addition to relying on the intensive labor of the Railway Corps of the People's Liberation Army and the staff of various stations, as well as the enthusiastic support of the people across the country, especially those along the railway lines, is also due to the sincere and enthusiastic assistance of the friendly Soviet Union and Soviet experts. Without the material and experienced assistance of the socialist Soviet Union and its experts, it would be unimaginable for our economically backward country of China to complete such a large-scale railway construction in a short period of one year. After signing the Northeast Trade Agreement with us, the Soviet Union supplied us with 500 kilometers of railway steel rails and their accessories within three months, which gave us sufficient guarantee in terms of railway construction materials. Soviet experts gave us many valuable suggestions in the design of railway construction plans and in the guidance of engineering technology, and encouraged Chinese workers with their own selfless work spirit, and everyone actively buried themselves in hard work. Because of their selfless assistance, many arduous projects, especially dangerous projects such as bridge erection, were able to overcome various difficulties and be completed ahead of schedule. Therefore, when the north-south railways are smooth today, while thanking the efforts of 500,000 railway workers, we cannot help but sincerely thank the Soviet Union and the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts.

    Chairman Mao pointed out as early as the beginning of 1949: "China's economic heritage is backward, but the Chinese people are brave and hardworking. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, plus the assistance of the proletarians of all countries in the world, mainly the assistance of the Soviet Union, will make the speed of China's economic construction not very slow but possibly quite fast, and China's prosperity can be achieved in a matter of time." The success of railway construction, one of the centers of restoration work in 1949, is a proof of Chairman Mao's vision. Based on the experience of railway traffic recovery, we have every reason to believe that China's industry and agriculture can be restored within three to five years, and the wounds of war can be healed; and in eight to ten years, China's industry and agriculture will be greatly developed.

### 祝京汉、粤汉两大铁路通车

    祝京汉、粤汉两大铁路通车
    京汉、粤汉两大铁路在元旦全线通车，这是中国大陆完全统一的象征，也是新中国建设事业伟大前途的象征。
    京汉、粤汉两路的通车，使中国由北方国境线上的满州里至国境南端的广州，可以由铁路交通直达，并使东北、华北、华东、中南、西北各大行政区的铁路线联成了一片。这对于加强南北物资的交流和政治军事文化的联系，对于克服国家的战后困难，推进经济的恢复和建设工作，都有极大的意义。
    两大铁路在很短的时间内迅速地修复通车，和一九四九年超计划地完成八千二百多公里铁路的修建，充分地显示了中国人民在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导之下，不仅有能力推翻帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派的统治，而且有能力迅速地建设独立富强的国家，创造美满幸福的生活。京汉、粤汉两铁路的联运中断已十二年。日本帝国主义在占领中国大陆的八年时间中，曾竭尽一切努力使之通车，以便利其从事侵略战争和吮吸物资，但结果是失败了。国民党反动政府在接收以后的四年中，不但证明没有能力把它们修复，而且还在溃逃时进行了疯狂的破坏。只有中国人民政府，在一九四九年，当大规模的内战尚在猛烈进行的时候，随着人民解放军的胜利地节节前进，就在大军后面把全长二千五百九十六公里的两大铁路修复了。这是何等惊人的业绩！国民党匪帮不断地吹嘘所谓“敌后游击”，企图以土匪特务的破坏活动，来扰乱社会秩序，阻碍人民的建设事业。两大铁路的修复通车，证明他们这种所谓“敌后游击”的完全破产，证明在中国人民的铁拳之下，这些特务匪徒必将迅速消灭尽净，而没有形成什么“游击”的可能。
    京汉、粤汉两路及其他许多铁路如此迅速地修复，除了依靠人民解放军铁道兵团和各站员工的紧张劳动，以及全国各地特别是铁路沿线人民的热烈支援以外，还由于得到了友邦苏联和苏联专家的真诚的热忱的帮助。如果没有社会主义的苏联及其专家的物质的和经验的帮助，我们中国这样一个经济上落后的国家，要在一年的短暂时间内，完成这样巨大规模的铁路修建，是不可想象的事。苏联在和我们订立了东北贸易协定后，三个月内就供给了我们五百公里的铁路钢轨及其配件，使我们在铁路建设的材料方面有了足够的保证。苏联专家在铁路修建计划的设计上，在工程技术的指导上，给了我们许多宝贵的意见，并且以他们自身的忘我的工作精神，鼓励了中国的职工，大家都积极地埋头苦干。由于他们这种大公无私的帮助，就使许多艰巨的工程，尤其是像架设桥梁那样的险工，得以克服种种困难而提前完成。因此，当今天南北铁路畅通的时候，我们在感谢五十万铁路员工的努力同时，不能不衷心地感谢苏联和苏联专家的热心帮助。
    毛主席远在一九四九年初就曾指出：“中国的经济遗产是落后的，但是中国人民是勇敢而勤劳的，中国人民革命的胜利和人民共和国的建立，中国共产党的领导权，加上世界各国无产阶级的援助，其中主要地是苏联的援助，中国经济建设的速度将不是很慢而可能是相当快的，中国的兴盛是可能计日程功的。”作为一九四九年恢复工作中心之一的铁路建设的成功，便是毛主席的远见的明证。根据铁路交通恢复的经验，我们完全有理由相信，在三年五年以内就可以把中国的工业和农业恢复起来，治好战争的创伤；而在八年十年以后，中国的工业和农业就将得到很大的发展。
