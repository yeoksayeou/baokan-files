Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 15th. The standard work method implemented by the Tianjin No. 1 Textile Factory Weaving Mill has been proven to be a good method for improving product quality. For several years, the sum of second-class cloth, defective cloth, and short-length rates in the cloth produced by the factory had been hovering around 10%. After the liberation of Tianjin, although the factory's output increased compared to the past, the quality level did not improve. Since the implementation of the standard work method, by December 23rd of last year, the sum of second-class cloth, defective cloth, and short-length rates had been reduced to about 2%. In 1947, the number of yarn breaks per warp beam within 12,000 yards reached 50 to 130 times, which has now been reduced to 16.1 times. Before June of last year, the average downtime per loom per hour was 2.74 times, which has now been reduced to 1.3 times. The output of cloth in 1947 was 43.1 yards per machine in 10 hours, which has now increased to 45.54 yards; the rotation speed of the looms has decreased from 182 revolutions per minute in the past to 176 revolutions per minute, which reduces machine wear and tear and does not excessively increase the labor intensity of workers.

The implementation of the standard work method is based on re-establishing the investigation and inspection system; whether the investigation and inspection system can effectively improve production depends on whether these systems are supported by the workers. In February and March of last year, when the factory proposed re-establishing the investigation and inspection system to improve product quality, it was misunderstood by the workers. Workers in the winding workshop said, "In the past, inspections were only used to find faults and deduct workers' wages; now that we are liberated, this system should be abolished." Some workers often hid defective products to avoid inspection. Later, after the factory's Communist Party branch, trade union, engineers, and technicians went to the workshops to explain the purpose and benefits of the investigation to the workers, and at the same time, mobilized everyone to review the past inspection system, it was found that the basic reason why the past inspection system was unsatisfactory to the workers was that the inspectors never analyzed the reasons for the shortcomings and errors (for example, some of the problems in weaving were caused by problems in sizing and winding), so that the inspection of shortcomings was completely separated from the improvement of technology, forming the malpractice of only picking on faults, the reasons were unknown, the responsibilities were not distinguished, and the problems could not be corrected.

After reviewing and criticizing the shortcomings of the above-mentioned investigation and inspection system, the factory immediately appointed two skilled workers as investigators, and under the leadership of engineers and technicians, began to focus on investigating the production process of the cloth factory. The investigation found that on average, 43 out of 100 yarn breaks on the loom were caused by oversized joints and yarn shrinkage (i.e., the yarn was twisted into a bunch) in the preparation process (from spinning to winding, sizing, etc.). At this time, the blackboard newspaper wrote: "The factory has 2,026 looms, and 370 yards of cloth are produced less per day due to twisting. If twisting can be eliminated, the factory can produce 6,300 more pieces of cloth per year." The factory also invited technicians to use standard work methods on winding, warping, and sizing, and made twelve warp beams for a four-day trial. It was found that out of 440 yarn breaks, only 18 were stopped due to twisting, a decrease of more than 85% compared to the past. The factory took photos of this experiment using the standard work method and distributed them to various workshops for education and encouragement. Since then, new production records have continued to appear in various classes. Class B of the Second Workshop created a record of six yarn breaks on a warp beam, and soon Class A of the Second Workshop achieved only four yarn breaks, and then Class B created the highest record of only two yarn breaks.

In order to consolidate the above-mentioned achievements, after the implementation of the investigation and inspection system, the factory implemented a responsibility system and cloth ticket system among the various workshops that were interconnected in production. The scope of the responsibility system ranges from winding and warping to sizing and reed threading. The method is to divide every six or seven winding workers into a group to supply yarn exclusively for a certain warping machine. The five warp beams used by the sizing machine each time must also be finished products from the same warping machine. If there is a problem, the responsibility will be investigated in order according to the job number. The use of cloth tickets ranges from sizing, reed threading, and looms to the finishing workshop. Each warp beam is attached with a cloth ticket, which details the responsible persons in each sizing and reed threading workshop. When the loom workshop finishes a machine, if there are any non-compliance issues, the responsible person will be identified according to the cloth ticket job number before the shaft can be changed.

Now, the workers not only have no dissatisfaction with the investigation and inspection system, but also can supervise each other and ensure the improvement of output and quality.

Relying on the awareness and support of the workers, deepening the investigation and inspection system, discovering problems in production, and then conducting improvement experiments with the standard work method, and promoting its results - this is the main experience of the factory's effective implementation of the standard work method.

    天津中纺一厂织布厂实行标准工作法
    创造质量新纪录
    主要经验：依靠工人的觉悟，深入调查和检验，找出生产中的毛病，改进技术——以标准工作法实行重点试验，再普遍推广试验成果。
    厂方邀请技术工人有重点地进行试验
    【新华社天津十五日电】天津中纺一厂织布厂实行的标准工作法，已被证明是提高产品质量的好方法。在几年来该厂生产的布匹中，次布、电布、欠码率之和，一向徘徊在百分之十左右。天津解放以后，该厂虽然产量较前增加，但质量水平并没有改进。自实行标准工作法后，到去年十二月二十三日止，次布、电布、欠码率之和，已减至百分之二左右。一九四七年每个整经轴在一万二千码内断头达五十次到一百三十次，现已减至十六点一次。去年六月以前，每台布机一小时平均停车二点七四次，现降至一点三次。布的产量，一九四七年每台机十小时织四十三点一码，现增至四十五点五四码；织机的周转速度反由过去每分钟一百八十二转减为一百七十六转，既减少了机器的损磨，又不致使工人劳动强度过分提高。
    标准工作法的实行，是建立在重新树立调查和检验制度的基础上的；而调查和检验制度能否达到有效改进生产的目的，则决定于这些制度是否得到职工的拥护和支持。去年二三月间，当厂方为提高产品质量提出重新树立调查与检验制度时，曾受到工人的误解。络纱间工人说：“从前检查专为挑弄毛病，罚工人工资；如今解放了，应该取消这套制度。”个别工人为逃避检验，常常藏起有毛病的出品。以后经过厂内中共支部、工会以及工程师、技师等深入车间向工人解释调查的目的和好处，同时，发动大家对过去的检查制度进行了检讨，结果发现过去检查制度所以为工人不满，基本原因在于检查者对于缺点错误从不分析其产生的原因（比如织布中的毛病，有些就是由于浆纱、络线中的毛病造成的）使检查缺点与改进技术完全脱节，形成只挑弄毛病，原因不明，责任不分，毛病总无法改正的流弊。
    上述调查检验制度的缺点经过检讨批判后，厂方即以两个熟练工人担任调查工，在工程师、技师等带领下开始对布厂生产过程有重点地进行调查，调查中发现布机一百次断头中，平均有四十三次是准备工程（由纺纱到络筒、浆纱等）中接头过大和经纱捻缩（即纱绞了一束）所造成的。这时，黑板报便写出：“全厂有二千零二十六台布机，一天内因捻缩少出布三百七十码。如能消灭捻缩，一年内全厂就能多出布六千三百匹。”厂方也邀请了技术工人在络筒、整经、浆纱上使用标准工作法，制作了十二个整经轴，试验四天，发现在四百四十次断头中，因捻缩而停车的只有十八次，比过去减少了百分之八十五以上。厂方将这次采用标准工作法的试验拍成了照片，发到各车间，进行教育鼓励。此后，生产新纪录便在各班不断出现。二场乙班创造了一个整经轴断六根头的纪录，不久二场甲班就达到了只断四根头，接着乙班又创造了只断二根头的最高纪录。
    为了巩固上述成绩，该厂在调查和检验制度实行之后，又在生产相互联系的各车间之中，实行了责任制和布票制。责任制的范围是从络筒、整经到浆纱、穿箝，实行的方法是由每六个或七个络筒工人编为一组，专供某一整经机用纱；浆纱机每次所用的五个整经轴，也必须是同一整经机所出的成品，如果出了毛病，就按工号顺次追究责任。布票的使用是从浆纱、穿箝、布机到整理间，每个经轴附布票一张，详细填写浆纱、穿箝各间的责任者。当布机间每次了机的时候，如有不合规格等情事发生，即根据布票工号，查明责任，然后才能换轴。
    现在工人对于调查检验制度不但没有不满情绪，而且能够互相监督，并保证产量质量的提高。
    依靠工人的觉悟和支持，把调查和检验制度深入下去，从中发现生产中的毛病，然后以标准工作法进行改进的试验，并将其成果予以推广——这便是该厂实行标准工作法行之有效的主要经验。
