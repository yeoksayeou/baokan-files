Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 5th: TASS, Helsinki: The Central Committee of the Finnish Communist Party issued a resolution on the upcoming Finnish presidential election to the Finnish working class on the 4th, strongly urging the working class to unite its ranks, expose the capitalist policies of the Social Democrats to all the people, and fight them on the ground of these traitors. The resolution pointed out that as a result of the Social Democratic traitors implementing their policies in Finland: fascism has been revived, production has decreased, the standard of living has been lowered, unemployment has increased, and relations with the Soviet Union have deteriorated. The resolution also called on the working class to unanimously elect the Communist candidate, Pikola. Pikola was the first president of Finland after the war and participated in the delegation to Moscow in the spring of 1948 to sign the Finnish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance.

The editorial of the 20th anniversary of *Ny Tid* stated: "The current situation places particularly high demands on Communist Party publications. Communist Party publications must wage a difficult struggle to oppose enemies who have advantages in circulation and financial resources."
