    The Rebirth of the People's Steel Capital
    --A Record of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company--
    Cheng Min
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the nationally renowned steel capital, has, under the active restoration and development by the People's Government and the arduous efforts of all its workers, become the backbone of new China's heavy industry construction and a strong force in consolidating national defense and safeguarding world peace.
            The Tragic History of "Angang"
    In 1915, the traitorous thief Yuan Shikai shamelessly signed the traitorous Twenty-One Demands, and the Japanese obtained special privileges. Three years later, they established the Anshan Iron Works here. After the "September 18th" Incident in 1931, Chiang Kai-shek simply presented the Northeast to his Japanese masters. The Japanese invaders then expanded the factory's operations, established the "Showa Steel Works," and officially began steelmaking. After the Lugouqiao Incident in 1937, the Japanese invaders increased their investment by 200 million yen and successively built iron smelters, establishing the Second Steel Works, which was then merged into the so-called "Iron and Steel Production Blot of Manchuria's Mighty Strength" (i.e., an iron and steel monopoly group). In 1944, it was renamed "Manchuria Iron and Steel Co., Ltd.," with the vain hope of becoming a "permanent integrated steel operation." It possessed vast heavy industrial equipment for iron smelting, steelmaking, steel rolling, manufacturing, mining, coking, power, transportation, and more.
    In Anshan, the characteristic of the engineering equipment was imbalance: iron production exceeded steel, steel exceeded steel products, and the supply of iron ore fell far short of the needs of iron smelting. The Japanese invaders transported large quantities of semi-finished products—iron and steel billets—to Japan for further processing. This was the concrete implementation of the policy of "raw materials from China, industry in Japan." In terms of mining, the enemy adopted a robber-like plunder method, only mining rich ores, discarding large quantities of poor ores, and disregarding the waste of resources and the difficulty of future mining, thus destroying and shortening the life of the iron mine.
    In addition, the enemy used whips and prisons as cruel means of plundering cheap Chinese labor. Many heavy tasks lacked machinery and relied mostly on manual labor, with no safety equipment or labor insurance, and workers' lives were constantly at risk. According to statistics from 1942, an average of about fifteen people died or were seriously injured every day. If calculated based on the Japanese invaders' management for more than 30 years, it is unknown how much blood of our compatriots was sucked by the Japanese fascists. In terms of technology, its colonial nature was also fully manifested. Of the entire production management organization (excluding low-level personnel), there were more than 20,000 Japanese technicians and skilled workers. They only cared about extracting sweat and blood from Chinese workers and never taught them more technology.
            Arduous Restoration Work
    After "August 15th," Anshan suffered seven consecutive lootings by the Kuomintang bandit troops. Chiang's bandits carried out frantic plunder and destruction. When we took over last November, sunflowers grew everywhere, and the weeds were more than a meter tall. There was not a single complete machine, nor were there cadres, technical personnel, or skilled workers. The restoration work was extremely difficult. However, the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party will not be deterred by difficulties. In order to repair the factory, the workers enthusiastically launched a movement to contribute equipment. The equipment donated by the workers was worth tens of billions of Northeast currency at the time. In particular, they donated many machine components and various important instruments that could not be bought with money, which advanced the entire restoration production work by a month. This made a great contribution to supporting the national war and restoring Northeast industrial construction.
    Subsequently, they launched a patriotic emulation movement to guarantee the completion of the restoration production plan and a movement to create new production records. The amazing achievements that constantly emerged in the movement prompted the leadership to revise the restoration project and production plan three times to suit the speed of worker recovery. Taking iron production as an example, the original plan was increased by 97 percent in April and tripled in August. For example, the manufacture of the second small rolling mill took 97 hours during the puppet Manchukuo era, but was shortened to 52 hours in the patriotic emulation movement. Recently, worker Huang Xiushan created a new record of completing it in 21 hours, increasing efficiency by more than four times. Coking time was reduced from 22 hours in the Japanese puppet era to 16 hours. In the production of 1949 (restoration portion), most had exceeded the puppet Manchukuo level.
            How Were the Achievements Obtained?
    Boldly Cultivating and Promoting Workers
    In the process of restoring production, the first difficulty encountered by the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant was the lack of cadres and technical personnel. Under the policy of relying on workers to run the factory, the plant leadership determined the policy of boldly promoting workers. First, they relied on the 300 trained workers who were taken away during the retreat in the fall of 1948, assigning them to appropriate positions for various tasks according to their abilities. Then, they systematically cultivated active elements who had participated in the plant protection struggle, those who had been tested in the war, and active contributors and meritorious workers in the equipment donation campaign, and creators of new records, and successively ran five training courses for three to four hundred people. They also developed Communist Party members among these activists, established the party's leadership core, and became the locomotives and shock troops in their work. Under their leadership, they united and promoted the vast number of worker brothers. The plant also continuously held short-term training classes and night schools under the condition that production was not affected, explaining the principles while looking at the machines, teaching and practicing at the same time, so that the workers quickly became familiar with the performance of the machines. In addition, the plant stipulated that masters could get bonuses for training their apprentices well, and apprentices could graduate early if they learned well, and these were made one of the conditions for meritorious service. As a result, within a year, nearly a thousand workers were promoted to various production management personnel, technical personnel, and technicians, including more than ten factory directors and deputy factory directors. Workers have initially learned and understood how to master technology, overcome the serious difficulties of lacking technical personnel and skilled workers, and achieved the above-mentioned achievements in restoring production.
    In order to cultivate new-type intellectuals from worker backgrounds, they are now planning to establish regular workers' schools to train 2,000 new technical personnel within three years, and to enable those with excellent performance to continue their studies and become engineers and experts of new China in the future.
    Establishing a System for Receiving Workers
    "Angang" established a new system on Saturdays, where any employee could freely go to the highest-ranking leader—the company manager or party secretary—to talk about anything, from work to leadership, from employee benefits to family trivialities. This further strengthened the connection between leaders and workers, supplementing the deficiencies of the factory management committee and the workers' representative assembly, and becoming another way to implement democratic factory management. This method was also learned from our Soviet elder brother.
    Because this system was established, they absorbed many good suggestions from the workers' conversations. For example, they accepted a suggestion to use machines instead of manual labor to make small motor housings, which increased production efficiency tenfold.
    Wage Increases and Labor Insurance
    In the spring of the year before last, when the Chiang Kai-shek gang ruled, workers lived on chaff and wild vegetables for two whole months. After liberation in November of the year before last, it was during a famine, and the government lacked food, but the government still gave each person three catties of grain a day. Over the past year, with the development of the factory and the increasing improvement of production, the spearhead of wages has also been raised straight up five times. The highest wage now is 250 points, which is six times higher than the initial 90 catties per month. The production plan for this year estimates that it can increase by 15 to 20 percent, so the Northeast is planning to use this proportion to increase current wages and is preparing to implement a bonus wage system for exceeding quotas, proposing 2 to 3 percent of the total wage amount as a reward for creators of new records. In terms of worker welfare, canteens, bathhouses, clubs, hospitals, and worker dormitories have all been established one after another. Therefore, the mobility of workers has been greatly reduced, and no one is asking for higher wages. Workers deeply understand a truth: the happiness of workers is closely linked to their own enterprise. Only with the improvement of production can wages be increased day by day.
    Regarding labor insurance, there was no labor insurance at all in the past. When it was first implemented, the workers were very skeptical. Later, in the specific implementation, this skepticism gradually dissipated. Zhu Baochen, an old worker with 28 years of service who had been dismissed during the Chiang Kai-shek era, was not only restored to his job after liberation, but also received an old-age subsidy of 300,000 yuan every month. He worked even more conscientiously, carefully grasped the dispatch of air compressors and the temperature of ammonium sulfate, and increased the production of ammonium sulfate by more than 2 tons every day, creating a new record and receiving a bonus of 1,000 yuan. Under his promotion and the influence of the rewards, many workers have created more new records.
    New Operating Methods
    Recently, with the help of international friend Soviet experts, the factory has established a new operating method, which has been successful in the coking section. In the Japanese puppet period, the coking oven was discharged once every 22 hours, but now it only takes 16 hours, and the coke quality is good and the blocks are large. This surprised a certain foreign engineer who had worked here for decades. When the Soviet experts first came, they said after seeing the factory's previous production situation: "This is an unreasonable colonial characteristic. In the Soviet Union, it only takes 16 or 18 hours." At that time, no one dared to believe it, but it finally became a reality.
    There are several Soviet experts at "Angang," and their noble socialist qualities are very admirable. They have a high degree of internationalist spirit and are equally loyal to the cause of friends. They are familiar with every small screw and cherish them, not allowing a single one to be wasted. They have a work style that is simpler and more serious than our comrades, and this style has deeply moved many of our working comrades and has become a model for learning.
    "Angang" has now become the people's steel capital and is rapidly recovering and developing. I remember that last year someone specifically wrote an article in a reactionary newspaper ridiculing us: "They have no way to handle such a large factory as Anshan..." In addition, some people said: "It will take at least ten years, or even more, to restore it to its original appearance." They underestimated us too much. They will never understand what kind of wisdom and strength the Chinese working class will produce under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the help of the great socialist Soviet Union.

    人民钢都的新生
    ——记鞍山钢铁公司——
    程敏
    驰名全国的钢都——鞍山钢铁公司，在人民政府积极恢复发展和全体职工艰苦努力下，现已成为新中国重工业建设的脊梁，巩固国防和保卫世界和平的一支雄厚力量。
            “鞍钢”的惨痛历史
    一九一五年，窃国大盗袁世凯无耻签订卖国的二十一条，日人即取得特权，三年后在此开办鞍山制铁所。一九三一年“九一八”事变，蒋介石更干脆把东北奉送给它的日本主子。日寇即扩大该厂经营，成立“昭和制钢所”，正式开始炼钢。一九三七年芦沟桥事变后，日寇又增加二亿日元的投资，陆续增建炼铁炉，成立了第二制钢所，即合并成为所谓“满洲强大力量的钢铁生产布町克”（即钢铁垄断集团）。一九四四年改为“满洲制铁株式会社”，妄想成为“永久性的钢铁一贯作业”。它拥有庞大的炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、制造、采矿、炼焦、动力、运输等各种重工业设备。
    在鞍山，工程设备的特点是不平衡：铁比钢多，钢又比钢材多，铁矿石则大大供应不上炼铁的需要。日寇把大量的半成品——铁与钢胚运送日本，再制成加工品。这就是“原料中国、工业日本”政策的具体实施。开采方面，敌人采取强盗式的掠夺办法，单挖富矿，丢弃大量贫矿，毫不顾及浪费资源与将来开采的困难，摧残与缩短了铁矿的寿命。
    此外，敌人又以鞭笞与监狱作为掠夺廉价中国劳动力的残酷手段。许多繁重工作不多设机械，大部依靠人工，且没有安全设备，更没有劳动保险，工人生命朝不保夕。根据一九四二年的统计，每天死亡与重伤者平均约十五人，若以日寇经营三十多年统计，则不知有多少同胞的鲜血被日本法西斯吮吸了。在技术方面，也充分表现了它的殖民地性质。整个生产管理机构中的（低级人员除外）技术人员及技术工人，日本人共有二万多，他们只管在中国工人身上榨取血汗，从来也不教给工人们更多的技术。
            艰巨的恢复工作
    “八一五”以后，鞍山连续遭受国民党匪军七次的洗劫，蒋匪进行了疯狂的掠夺与破坏。当去年十一月我们刚接收时，遍地长满葵花，野草竟有一人多高，没有一架完整机器，也没有干部与技术人员和技术工人，恢复工作是十分困难的。但是共产党领导下的工人阶级，是不会被困难阻挠的，工人们为了修复工厂，热烈地展开了献交器材运动。工友们献出的器材，总计价值当时东北币数十亿。特别是他们献出了许多出钱无处购买的机器要件，和各种重要仪器，把整个的恢复生产工作推前了一个月。这对于支援全国战争与恢复东北工业建设的供献是很大的。
    随后，他们又开展了保证完成修复生产计划的立功竞赛运动与创造生产新纪录运动。在运动中不断出现的惊人成绩，使领导上为了适合工人恢复的速度，对修复工程和生产计划改订了三次。以产铁为例，四月份提升了原计划的百分之九十七，八月份则提高到原计划三倍。如制造第二小型小轧滚，伪满时代是九十七小时，立功运动中缩短到五十二小时，近来工人黄秀山又创造了二十一小时完成的新纪录，提高效率四倍多。炼焦由日伪时代二十二小时缩短到十六小时。在一九四九年的生产中（恢复部分），大部已超过了伪满水平。
            成绩是怎样得来的
    大胆培养提拔工人
    鞍山钢铁厂在恢复生产的过程中，首先遭到的困难是干部和技术人员的缺乏。在依靠工人办工厂的方针下，该厂领导上确定了大胆提拔工人的方针。首先是依靠一九四八年秋撤退时带走的受过训练的三百个工人，按照每个人的能力，把他们分配到各种工作的适当位置。然后他们又把在护厂斗争中，和经过战争考验的，以及献交器材中的积极分子和立功的功臣们、新纪录创造者，有计划地进行培养，先后开办了五期三四百人的训练班。并在这批积极分子里发展了共产党员，建立了党的领导核心，成为工作中的火车头和突击手。在他们的带头下，团结与推动了广大的工人弟兄。该厂又在不影响生产的条件下，连续举办了短期训练班和夜校，看着机器讲道理，一面教一面实习，使工人们很快就熟悉了机器的性能。另外，该厂又规定了师傅带好徒弟可得奖金、徒弟早学好可以先期出师的办法，并把这些作为立功条件之一。因此，在一年之内提拔工人成为各种生产管理人员、技术人员与技师，将近千名。其中包括十多个正副厂长。工人已初步学会和懂得掌握技术，克服了缺乏技术人员与技术工人的严重困难，达到了恢复生产的上述成绩。
    为了培养工人出身的新型知识分子，现在他们正有计划地创办正规的工人学校，要求三年内培养二千个新技术人员，并使成绩优良者继续深造，成为新中国未来的工程师与专家。
    建立接见工人制度
    “鞍钢”在星期六建立了一种习以为常的新制度，任何职工都可随便去找领导的最高负责人——公司经理或党委书记谈话，内容不拘，从工作到领导，从职工福利到家庭琐事，什么都可以谈。这就更进一步密切了领导与工人之间的联系，以弥补工厂管理委员会与工人代表会之不足，成为贯彻工厂管理民主化的另一种方式。这种办法也是从苏联老大哥那里学来的。
    因为建立了这种制度，他们从工人的谈话中吸收了许多好的建议，如接受了一个使用机器代替手工做小电动机外壳的建议，即提高了生产效率十倍。
    工资上升与劳动保险
    在前年春天蒋匪帮统治时，整整两个月工人是吃糠咽菜过日子的。前年十一月解放后，当时正逢饥荒，公家缺粮食，但政府仍给每人一天发三斤粮。一年来，随着工厂的发展和生产的日益提高，工资的矛头亦直线向上提高了五次。现在最高工资是二百五十分，比开始每月的九十斤提高了六倍。今年度生产计划估计可以提高百分之十五到二十，因此，东北正拟用此比例来提高现在的工资，并正准备实行超额奖励工资制，提出工资总额的百分之二至三，作为奖励新纪录的创造者。工人福利方面，食堂、澡堂、俱乐部、医院和工人宿舍都先后建立起来。因此，工人的流动性大大减少，也没有谁要求提高工资。工人们深深的体会到一个真理，工人的幸福与自己的企业密切相联，只有随着生产的提高，工资才能日益增进。
    在劳动保险方面，从前根本没有劳动保险。开始实行时，工人们还非常怀疑。后来在具体实行中，这种怀疑才逐渐打消。蒋匪时代曾解雇的二十八年工龄的老工友朱宝臣，解放后他不但恢复了工作，每月还领到三十万元的老年补助金，他更加认真工作，仔细掌握空气压缩机的调度与硫酸錏的温度，产硫酸錏每天增加二吨多，创造了新纪录，得到一千元的奖金。在他的推动与奖励的影响下，许多工友都创造了更多的新纪录。
    新的操作方法
    最近该厂在国际友人苏联专家的帮助之下，建立了一种新的操作法，这种操作法在炼焦部分已获得成就。日伪时期炼焦炉二十二小时出一次，现在只要十六小时，且焦炭质量好、块子大。这使过去在此工作几十年的某外籍工程师惊讶不已。当苏联专家刚来时，看到该厂以前的生产情况就说：“这是不合理的殖民地式的特点，在苏联只要十六或十八小时就可以。”当时谁都不敢相信，而它终于成为事实了。
    在“鞍钢”有好几位苏联专家，他们的高尚的社会主义品质，非常令人钦佩。他们具有高度的国际主义精神，对于朋友的事业，同样具有无限忠心。他们熟悉到每个小螺丝钉，并且爱惜它们，一个也不许浪费。他们有比我们同志更朴素更认真的工作作风，这种作风使得我们许多工作同志深为感动，而成为学习的榜样。
    “鞍钢”现在已经成为人民的钢都，而且在迅速恢复与发展着。记得去年曾有人专门写文章在反动报纸上嘲笑我们：“他们对鞍山这样一个大工厂是根本没法处理的……”；另外还有人说：“至少要十年，甚至更多的年代才能恢复它的本来面貌”。他们过低估计了我们，他们永远不会了解，中国工人阶级在共产党的领导和伟大的社会主义的苏联帮助下，将会产生一种怎么样的智慧与力量。
