    Rinderpest Symptoms and Prevention
            I. Pathogen
    The pathogen of this disease is an ultramicroscopic filterable virus. It exists in the blood, tissue fluid, secretions, and excretions (saliva, nasal discharge, feces, urine, tears, sweat, and mucus from the reproductive organs of cows) of infected cattle. In the blood, the virus is mostly attached to the surface of white blood cells. If this virus is sealed in a container in manure or in blood, milk, or urine, away from sunlight, its viability can be maintained for several months. However, it is easily killed by sunlight, dry air, putrid environments, heating to 60 degrees Celsius, or exposure to slightly weak disinfectants.
            II. Routes of Transmission
    The transmission of this disease mostly occurs through direct contact with infected cattle or through intermediate carriers. It usually enters through the digestive system. In addition, biting flies among insects also serve as transmission vectors. Whether air can act as a transmission medium, entering through the trachea, is still questionable according to experiments. Therefore, in pastoral areas, digging wide ditches that other animals cannot cross to isolate infected cattle can prevent transmission. Also, isolating infected cattle with wooden boards in the cowshed can prevent transmission.
            III. Susceptibility
    This disease spreads most fiercely. Among livestock, sheep, goats, camels, water buffalo, and pigs are most susceptible, especially calves. However, cattle born in areas where this disease frequently occurs have a high resistance to it, and even if they become infected, the disease is less severe, and the mortality rate is lower. Cattle that have recovered from the disease have immunity for many years or a lifetime. Humans and horses can also be infected.
            IV. Symptoms
    The incubation period of this disease is usually three to nine days, but it can also be ten to seventeen days. Its symptoms can be divided into two stages: the prodromal stage and the manifest stage.
    A. Prodromal Stage – In this stage, the animal's body temperature first rises to 40 to 42 degrees Celsius. After the second day, the disease intensifies, and the animal becomes depressed and listless, paying no attention to people around it. The head often rests on the trough, the ears droop, and the eyes are half-closed. However, sometimes it suddenly becomes excited. After one or two hours, it becomes depressed again. At this time, appetite decreases, it does not eat forage, rumination is slow or even stops. The whole body often trembles violently, teeth grind, there are spasms, and the skin temperature is irregular. The base of the ears and horns are hot. The muzzle is dry, the coat is bristly, breathing is rapid, and the pulse increases. This continues for one or two days before transitioning to the manifest stage.
    B. Manifest Stage – In this stage, inflammatory symptoms appear on the mucous membranes. The eyelids swell, the conjunctiva is bright red, and tears flow, gradually becoming sticky or purulent. When the eyelids are opened by hand, a large amount of fluid flows out. There is a thin pseudomembrane on the inflamed conjunctiva, and the cornea is sometimes cloudy or inflamed.
    The nasal discharge is initially viscous, then becomes purulent, foul-smelling, gray or brown, and often mixed with blood. The nasal mucosa is initially a necrotic red color, then becomes diffused throughout, with deep red bleeding spots scattered within. There are brownish-yellow scabs on the muzzle, especially near the nostrils.
    Many blisters appear on the oral mucosa, about one to two millimeters in size, evenly scattered on the lower gums and the mucous membrane of the lips. At this time, the oral cavity is hot, and saliva flows from the corners of the mouth. Soon the blisters rupture, and the mucosa at the blister sites appears as small, light yellow patches, like attached bran, which can be wiped off to reveal the non-bleeding underlying muscle tissue. In mild cases, the number of blisters is small, but the shape is larger. This situation can be seen especially at the base of the lower gums. Once the blisters rupture, other bacteria invade, causing tissue necrosis, resulting in large, irregular ulcers, but without pus or blood. At this time, the mouth smells foul, is painful, and the cattle do not eat or only drink water.
    The cattle initially have dry, dark-colored feces, then develop colic, followed by diarrhea. At this time, the feces are thin, changing from porridge-like to liquid, foul-smelling, and further mixed with blood, mucus clumps, and necrotic fragments and pseudomembranes (several inches to several feet long) resulting from inflammation and ulceration in the intestine. In the late stages of the disease, the cattle cannot control defecation, and the anus is open and incontinent.
    The frequency of urination increases, but the amount each time is very small, and the color is yellow-red to black-brown.
    Initially, the reproductive organs of female cattle discharge a purulent mucous secretion, further mixed with blood. The labia swell, the mucous membrane is congested, and a gray or yellow pseudomembrane forms on its surface, which then falls off, forming dark red sores.
    Initially, the cattle cough frequently with pain, but when the disease becomes severe, the cough often disappears. However, the respiratory rate increases, sixty to eighty times per minute, resulting in difficulty breathing and groaning. The pulse is initially fifty to sixty, then becomes eighty to one hundred. In the late stages of the disease, the pulse is relatively weak and thready. The body temperature initially rises and does not fall, usually reaching its highest point on the fifth to sixth day. When the disease is severe, the cattle have diarrhea, and then the temperature drops below normal. However, in well-managed cases, it can return to normal.
    Milk production decreases in lactating cows, and even the milk secreted is a yellow, watery liquid. Pregnant cows often abort.
    The above symptoms gradually worsen, and the cattle become emaciated, with a haggard appearance, and eventually die from exhaustion.
            V. Prevention and Treatment
    Drug treatment for this disease is ineffective. However, in the early stages, injecting anti-rinderpest serum may save them. The preventive measures are only to inject rinderpest vaccine or anti-rinderpest serum. However, while this is effective, livestock owners should also pay attention to hygiene in normal times. Especially when rinderpest is rampant, in addition to the government demarcating areas at the borders of each epidemic area, implementing martial law, and setting up veterinarians to strictly carry out quarantine, prohibiting the entry, exit, buying, selling, and transportation of cattle, livestock owners should also pay attention to general preventive management. Only in this way can we achieve twice the result with half the effort.
    To preserve the survival of healthy cattle, livestock owners should separate infected cattle from healthy cattle, keeping the infected ones in their original pens and feeding them there, and not letting them out. Healthy cattle must be fed individually. Management personnel, feeding troughs, water buckets, and all other utensils must be prepared separately and not used in common. People entering and leaving the infected cattle pen should pay special attention not to allow the excrement, urine, nasal discharge, saliva, tears, and other excretions of the infected cattle to contaminate their hands, feet, and clothing, and should pay attention to disinfecting with lime or limewater at any time to avoid indirect transmission. Furthermore, strictly control the entry and exit of other livestock and poultry into the cattle pen. It is best to lay quicklime at the entrance of the cattle pen to disinfect the soles of shoes.
    As for those healthy, disease-free cattle, they should be quickly injected with rinderpest vaccine. The meat of infected cattle that have died cannot be sold. It is best to burn the carcasses. If they are not burned, they must be boiled in a pot for a long time. Otherwise, the virus of the infected cattle will not be killed and can still be transmitted. However, the feces and other filth inside the abdomen must also be burned and not discarded casually or washed in rivers or wells. The skin must also be scrubbed with concentrated limewater.
    After the death of infected cattle, the cattle pens and utensils that they have used must be disinfected with limewater or sprinkled with lime powder or placed in the sun for exposure. Items that are not valuable, such as the feces and urine of infected cattle and the remaining feed, should be completely removed and burned or buried deeply. The walls, ground, roof, doors, windows, and corners should also be brushed with thick limewater before being used by healthy cattle.
    After the carcass is placed on the ground and the skin is removed, the soil on that spot should also be sprinkled with lime powder or removed by two or three inches, layered with some grass, and burned with fire, which can also be used as fertilizer.
    Roads passed by infected or dead cattle, if there are feces, urine, or other pollutants left behind, must be removed and burned or sprinkled with lime powder. The utensils used to draw water when skinning the cattle must not be used directly at the well or river bank to draw water. After the cattle are skinned, these utensils should also be disinfected. In addition, the hands, clothes, and shoes of the people skinning the cattle should also be disinfected.
    Sports fields, ditches, etc., where it is suspected that viruses have been mixed in or pollutants have contaminated, must be swept clean and injected with limewater or sprinkled with lime powder.
    If rinderpest occurs upstream along the river, be sure not to lead cattle to the river to drink water or use river water to wash cattle utensils to avoid transmission.

    牛瘟的病状及预防
            一、病原
    本病病原为超显微镜滤过性毒质。存于病牛血液、组织液、分泌物、排泄物（口涎、鼻涕、粪尿、泪液、汗、母牛生殖器粘液）内。在血液内之病毒多附着于白血球表面。此病毒在厩肥内或在血液、乳、尿内，将其密闭于器中，不见日光，贮藏之，其生活力能保持数月。但在日光下，干燥空气中，或放于腐败地方，或加温摄氏六十度，或放入稍弱的消毒液内，亦容易使其死灭。
            二、传染的途径
    本病的传染，大都由病牛直接传染，或由中间媒介物传染。通常由消化器侵入。此外昆虫中的刺蝇，亦为传染的媒介物。空气能否作传染煤介，从气管侵入，据试验尚属疑问。所以在牧区里如掘其他动物不能越过的宽广的沟，将瘟牛隔离开，即可避免传染。同时于牛舍中以木板隔离瘟牛，亦可避免传染。
            三、易感性
    本病传播最烈。家畜中以绵羊、山羊、骆驼、水牛、猪最易传染，尤以小牛为甚。惟生产于常发生本病地方的牛只，对本病富有抵抗力，纵得病，其病势较轻。死亡率亦低。得过本病痊愈的牛，有多年或终生免疫性。本病人与马亦传染。
            四、病状
    本病潜伏期，普通为三日至九日，然亦有十日至十七日的。其病状可分二期来说，一为前驱期、二为显露期。
    Ａ、前驱期——在此期病畜体温首先上升到摄氏四十度至四十二度。经过第二日，病势渐高，精神悒郁、倦怠，人围其左右，不知注意。头常倚槽，耳下垂，眼半开，但有时忽发兴奋状，经过一二小时，又悒郁起来，在这时食欲减少，不吃饲草，反刍迟缓，乃至停止。全身时常剧战、轧齿、抽筋、皮温不正，耳根及角根均发热。鼻镜干燥，皮毛耸立，呼吸急促，脉搏增加，似此持续一二日，即转入显露期。
    Ｂ、显露期——在此期其体内粘膜即发生炎性病状。眼睑肿胀，眼膜鲜红，泪下流，渐变粘性或脓性，用手将眼睑张开，则有大量液体外流。发炎之眼膜面上有微薄假膜，角膜有时混浊或发炎。
    鼻流涕，起先是粘性，以后变成脓性，有恶臭，呈灰色或褐色，往往有血液混于其内。鼻膜初为坏状红色，后则弥漫全部，有深红出血点散布其间，鼻镜上有棕黄色痂状物，靠近鼻孔之旁尤多。
    口粘膜起许多水泡，大小约一至二毫米，匀散于下牙床及唇的粘膜上。此时口腔发热，口角流涎，不久水泡破裂，水泡处的粘膜呈淡黄色小块，如粘附之糠皮，拭之即脱，则现出不出血的下层肌肉组织。遇病势轻者，水泡数目少，但形状较大，此种情形，尤其在下牙床基部可以看出。水泡既裂，其他杂菌侵入组织坏死，因而变成形状不整的大溃疡，但没有脓血。此时口腔发臭，疼痛，病牛不食，或只饮水。
    病牛在当初大便干燥，色暗，后即呈疝痛状，随之腹泻。此时粪稀薄，从粥状变成液状，恶臭，更进而混有血液，粘液块，及因肠内发炎溃烂而生之坏死片与假膜，（长数寸至数尺）。病至末期，病牛排粪即不能自主，肛门哆开失禁。
    病牛小便次数加增，惟每次份量甚少，色黄红至黑棕。
    牝牛生殖器病初流脓性粘液分泌物，更进而杂有血液。阴唇肿胀，粘膜充血，其表面生灰色或黄色假膜，后即脱落，形成暗红色烂斑。
    病牛起初频发带痛性咳嗽，到病势沉重的时候，往往咳嗽消失。不过呼吸次数增加，一分钟六十至八十次，因之呼吸困难，现呻吟状。脉搏初为五十至六十，后变为八十至一百，在病的末期，脉搏比较细弱，呈线状。体温初上升不退，通常在第五日至第六日达最高度，到病重的时候，病牛腹泻，则再降至常度以下，但遇经过良好的场合，可恢复常温。
    产乳母牛得病泌乳量即减少，纵分泌出之乳汁，亦呈黄色水状液。孕牛常流产。
    以上病状乃系逐渐加重，病牛多羸瘦，颜貌憔悴，形容枯槁，终至虚脱而死。
            五、预防及治疗
    本病治疗，药物无效，惟在初起时，可注射抗牛瘟血清，或有挽救。预防之法，只有注射牛瘟疫苗或注射抗牛瘟血清，然此效力固有，但畜主平时亦应注意饲养卫生，尤其当此牛瘟猖獗之际，政府除已在每个疫区交界处，划定范围，实行戒严，并设置兽医，严行检疫，禁止牛只出入、买卖转运等事，在畜主方面，更应注意一般预防之管理，如此才能收事半功倍之效。
    为了保全健康牛的生存，畜主应将病牛与好牛分别隔离，把有病的留在原圈内喂养，不可放在外面，没病的则须个别喂养。管理人，食槽、水桶及其他一切用具都要另外准备，亦不可通用。在病牛圈出入的人，尤应注意勿使病牛的粪尿、鼻涕、唾液、眼泪等排泄物沾染在手足及衣服之上，并须注意随时用石灰或石灰水消毒，以免间接传播。且要严格管制其他家畜家禽出入牛圈，牛圈门口最好铺垫生石灰作鞋底消毒之用。
    至于那些无病健康的牛，亦应赶快注射牛瘟疫苗。染病死亡的病牛，其肉不能向外出售，最好用火将尸体焚烧，如不肯焚烧，则必须放在锅内经长时间滚煮，否则，病牛的病毒，不会死灭，仍能传染。但其腹内粪污等亦必须加以焚烧，不要随便抛弃或到河边井旁洗涤一切尸物和器具。其皮亦必须用浓度石灰水刷洗。
    病牛死后凡被其用过之牛圈及用具，千万要将其消毒，用石灰水洗涤或撒布石灰粉或放在日光下曝晒。价值不贵的东西，如病牛的粪尿与残余的饲料，顶好完全将其取出用火焚烧或深埋，围墙、地面、房顶、门窗、墙角，亦应用浓厚的石灰水将其刷过一遍，然后再给健康的牛使用。
    尸体放在地下皮剥了之后，那块地上的土，亦应撒布石灰粉于其上，或将其清除二三寸、层叠些草，以火焚烧，充作肥料亦可。
    病牛或死牛所经的道路，如遗有粪尿或其他污物，亦须将其铲除，予以焚烧或撒石灰粉。剥牛时，所用取水之用具，不可直接到井边河边打水，牛剥好后，此种用具亦应消毒，此外剥牛的人手、衣服及鞋亦应予以消毒。
    运动场、沟渠等，凡疑有病毒混入或排泄物污染之处，均须扫除清洁，注以石灰水或撒布石灰粉。
    沿河上游如发生牛瘟，此时务必不要牵牛到河边饮水，或用河水洗刷牛具，以免传染。
