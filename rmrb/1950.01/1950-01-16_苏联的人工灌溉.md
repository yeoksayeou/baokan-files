Soviet Artificial Irrigation

Artificial irrigation is the oldest method of mankind to combat drought. In the Soviet Union, there are hundreds of millions of hectares of land where the annual rainfall is less than 300-400 millimeters. These lands are all located in the arid steppes or semi-desert areas of southern Soviet Union. The soil is very good, and heat and light (two factors for crop growth) are abundant. They should have been good for growing valuable crops such as wheat, cotton, sugar beets, grapes, and sunflowers. However, crops need a lot of water. According to calculations, every kilogram of wheat harvested requires 500 kilograms of water, sometimes even reaching 1,500 kilograms. The Soviet people cannot simply abandon such valuable land because of the climate. They are already using advanced science and technology to fight against these natural conditions, and artificial irrigation occupies a considerable position in this struggle.

Irrigating fields is a very labor-intensive and expensive task. Because crops need to be irrigated every year, large-scale funds and efforts are needed to build dams, reservoirs, canals, power stations, pumping stations, rain machines, and other equipment. And all this equipment must be constantly working for irrigation, must be repaired, and must be replaced. Therefore, a large number of experienced hydraulic engineers, mechanics, and so on are needed.

These vast expenditures can be exchanged for abundant harvests. In the artificially irrigated fields, Soviet production experts have been able to harvest more than 20,000 catties of wheat per hectare (15 mu), or 40,000 catties of millet, 200,000 catties of sugar beets, and 20,000 to 30,000 catties of cotton! In the irrigated fields of Central Asia, Kazakhstan, Kuban and other places, rice also has rich harvests.

In the Soviet Union, great attention is paid to irrigation work. Whether it is the scale of irrigation work, the degree of mechanization of irrigation, or the scientific basis of various irrigation methods, the Soviet Union ranks first in the world. The post-war Five-Year Plan (1946-1950) stipulates that 2 billion rubles should be spent on land improvement and irrigation equipment. This means that in the post-war Five-Year Plan, more than one million rubles will be spent on these works every day. But these expenditures have brought significant results. New irrigation systems and irrigation buildings are being completed and put into operation year after year.

In early 1949, a dam was built on the Kuban River (which flows into the Black Sea) in Nevinnomyssk, Stavropol region, and the Nevinnomyssk Canal was built. From then on, the azure Kuban River water can irrigate the dry land of Stavropol.

In 1948, the Farkhad power station on the Syr Darya River (which flows into the Aral Sea) was put into operation. The huge dam cut off the surging flow, thus raising its water level by tens of meters. A new reservoir was formed in the so-called Hungry Steppe, storing millions of cubic meters of water. This steppe is called the "Hungry" Steppe because it was barren before it was transformed. And now the Hungry Steppe is crisscrossed by sky-blue canal branches. They bring the water of the Syr Darya to the parched land. Now the Hungry Steppe is full of lush cotton fields, orchards, melon fields, and vineyards shining with green light.

On the Syr Darya River, near Kyzylorda, another dam and the irrigation system surrounding it are under construction. The construction of the Fergana Syr Darya Reservoir has begun, which is the so-called Kairakkum Sea, which will soon be able to irrigate 600 square kilometers of land.

The irrigation system on the Uzbek Sea (Katta-Kurgan Reservoir) has also been completed and started working. In 1948, it was able to irrigate more than 200,000 hectares of cotton fields.

In previous years, such huge irrigation systems have been built for equally arid regions and deserts, such as the Fergana Great Stalin Canal, the Kirov Canal in the Hungry Steppe, and the Krasnolechen irrigation system in Kyrgyzstan. This is truly the construction of the people, and hundreds of thousands of collective farm peasants have participated in these works. The construction of two other large irrigation canals has also been planned and route surveying is underway, on the Amu Darya River, another large river in Central Asia. These buildings will be able to irrigate several million hectares of arid steppes and deserts.

In Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, and Turkmenistan, dams and canals are being built. During the Soviet era, 1,500 irrigation buildings were established in Turkmenistan, and more than 7,000 kilometers of irrigation canals were tunneled through in Armenia.

On the peaks of the Pamir Mountains, the Tian Shan Mountains, and the Caucasus Mountains, huge amounts of ice and snow are stored. After these ice and snow melt, they create the upper reaches of rivers, such as the Amu Darya River, the Syr Darya River, the Ili River, the Chu River, the Kura River, and the Araks River all draw water from here. The Soviet people control these waters to serve the harvest. If the ice and snow on the top of the mountain melts too quickly in the summer and the river water is excessive, it is stored in the reservoir so that it can be irrigated all year round.

Also, Soviet irrigation buildings are equipped with the most advanced technology. There are electric motors, pumping stations, canal excavators and other various irrigation machines.

The Soviet regime has helped the people of all nationalities in the Central Asian republics to get rid of the economic, cultural, industrial and agricultural backwardness of the Middle Ages. And without a doubt, with the help of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, the Central Asian republics will not only quickly turn the existing semi-deserts and deserts into oases, but also develop orchards, pastures and farmland on them.

The construction of irrigation buildings (reservoirs, canals, etc.) in arid land is pursuing a practical purpose, which is to supply crops with water and obtain high yields. But in addition, tens of billions of cubic meters of water are drawn from the river, retained in the fields, and then evaporated by plants, the climate changes and becomes humid. Then the wild animals and plants will also be affected and react. The entire face of these places is changing and becoming unrecognizable.

Deserts and arid steppes are being awakened and moving towards a new life. (Compiled by Li Ren)

    苏联的人工灌溉
    人工灌溉是人类对旱灾斗争的最老的方法。在苏联，年降雨量在三四百公厘以下的土地有数亿公顷。这些土地都在苏联南部干旱草原或半沙漠地区，土壤都很好，而且热和光（作物生长的两个因素）很充足，本来应当很好地生长小麦、棉花、糖萝卜、葡萄、向日葵等有价值的作物。但是作物需要水分很多，据计算，每一公斤小麦的收获，便需要五百公斤的水，有时甚而达到一千五百公斤。苏联人民不能因为气候的原故，而白白放弃掉这样宝贵的土地。他们已在用进步的科学技术，和这些自然条件作斗争，在这个斗争中人工灌溉占相当的位置。
    灌溉田地是一件费劳力很多，而且花钱也很多的事。因为作物每年都要灌溉，所以便需要大规模的资金与努力来建筑水坝、水库、运河、发电站、抽水机站、降雨机等等的装备。而所有这些装备为了灌溉，便得经常在工作状态中，便得修理，得换装。于是又必得有大量经验丰富的水利工程师、机械师等等。
    这些浩繁的支出可以换得丰富的收获。在人工灌溉的田亩上，苏联的生产能手已能从每公顷（十五亩）的田地收到两万多斤小麦，或四万斤黍子，二十万斤糖萝卜，两万斤到三万斤的棉花！而在中亚细亚、卡萨赫斯坦、库班等地的灌溉田地，稻子也有丰富的收成。
    在苏联对灌溉工作所寄注意很大。不论是灌溉工作的规模，不论是灌溉机械化的程度，不论是各种灌溉方法的科学依据，苏联都是在全世界占第一位的。战后五年计划（一九四六——一九五○）中规定，为土地改良和灌溉等设备要支出二十亿卢布。这也就是说在战后五年计划里每一天便要花费一百多万卢布于这些工作。但这些花费都带来了显著的成果，一年一年新的灌溉系统、灌溉建筑在完成，并开动工作。
    一九四九年初斯塔弗罗波里地方在库班河（注入黑海）上的涅文诺墨斯筑了一个水坝，修了涅文诺墨斯水渠。从此碧蓝的库班河水便可灌溉斯塔弗罗波里干枯的土地了。
    一九四八年锡尔河（注入咸海）上的法尔哈德发电站开动了。巨大的水坝把汹涌的奔流截断，因而提高其水平面达数十公尺。在所谓饥饿草原上形成了新的水库，储藏数百万立方公尺的水。这块草原之所以称为“饥饿”草原，是因为在未着手来改造它以前，它是寸草不生的。而现在饥饿草原上纵横着天蓝色的河渠支干。它们把锡尔河水带给酷渴的土地。现在在饥饿草原里遍布着丰茂的棉田、果园、瓜田、葡萄园闪着绿光。
    在锡尔河上，基悉尔奥得附近，另外一个水坝及环绕它的灌溉系统在建筑中。费尔干锡尔河大水库的建筑已经动工，这即所谓卡伊拉克库姆海，它不久即可灌溉六百平方公里的土地。
    乌兹别克海（卡塔库尔甘水库）上的灌溉系统亦已完成并开始工作了。一九四八年它已能灌溉棉田达二十万公顷以上。
    在前几年，曾为同样干旱地区和沙漠建筑如此巨大的灌溉系统，如费尔甘斯大林大渠，饥饿草原中的基洛夫渠，吉尔吉斯的克拉斯诺勒勤灌溉系统等。这真是人民的建设，数十万集体农庄农民都参加了这些工作。还有另外两条大灌溉运河的建筑也已经拟定了计划，并在勘测路线了，这是在中亚另一条大河阿姆河上的。这些建筑将能灌溉好几百万公顷的干旱草原和沙漠。
    在吉尔吉斯、卡萨赫斯坦、亚塞拜然、格鲁吉亚、亚美尼亚、土谷曼都在兴筑水坝和河渠。在苏维埃的年代里，在土谷曼便建立了一千五百处灌溉建筑，在亚美尼亚则凿通了七千多公里的灌溉运河。
    在帕米尔山、天山、高加索山的顶巅上，积存着巨量的冰雪，这些冰雪消融之后，造成了河水的上源，如阿姆河、锡尔河、伊犁河、楚河、库鲁河、阿拉克斯河等都是取水于此的。苏联人民便控制这些水为收获服务。如果在夏天，山顶冰雪融化得过快，河水过量，则把它储藏到水库中，以使常年可以灌溉。
    还有，苏联的灌溉建筑，装备着最前进的技术。有电动机、抽水机站、河渠开掘机等等各种各样的灌溉机器。
    苏维埃政权已经帮助中亚细亚各共和国诸民族人民，使他们摆脱经济上、文化上、工业及农业上中世纪的落后。而且毫无疑义，在苏联各民族的帮助下，中亚细亚各共和国将不仅很快地把现有的半沙漠和沙漠变成绿洲，而且还在其上发展果园、牧草地和农田。
    在干旱土地上建设灌溉的建筑（水库、水渠等）是追求着实践目的的，那就是供给庄稼以水分，取得高度收获。但除此之外，几十亿立方公尺的水从河中引出，保持于田地中，再被植物蒸发，气候便变化了，潮润了。于是野生的动植物也要受其影响，而有反应。这些地方的整个面貌正在变，要变得难以分辨。
    沙漠和干旱的草原正被催醒，走向新的生活。（立人辑）
