    Dedicated to Mother
    Filial Piety
    Hui Duan Chun Xuan Ying

    When we heard that you had passed away in Beijing from cerebral hemorrhage, we wept, Father wept, relatives and friends wept, all the educators who wished to learn from you forever grieved, and the millions of people waiting for you to work for them lamented!

    Mother, we have lost you forever, Mother, millions upon millions of people have also lost you forever.

    Dearest Mother, why did you leave us so early?

    Under the scorching sun, in the storms, you toiled, you rushed about for work; in the dusk, in the deep of night, you forgot yourself; considering and planning your career.

    During those bitter years before liberation, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's various threats, pressures, and torments crushed your career; the news that the people's school was to be dissolved caused you sleepless nights, and the constant running around and anxiety increased the white in your hair. - You planted deep roots of illness at this time.

    When you saw the career you founded expanding day by day, and the people's school growing from one to one hundred and several dozen, your thin face was filled with joy. When students showed a high degree of talent, your haggard face showed deep comfort. You trained a large number of workers to serve the people, you trained a large number of the motherland's outstanding children. You cared for them, loved them, educated them. But, now? You have left them forever!

    Forced by the reactionaries, you had to leave the motherland and go to that distant foreign country; the people who loved you saw you off at Longhua Airport, and you said you would be back. Everyone waited for you like this; waiting, waiting, waiting for you to return.

    This August, you really came back. Returned to the embrace of the motherland where the people have already stood up to be masters of their own destiny. You participated in the People's Political Consultative Conference that laid the foundation of the country.

    We felt very honored, and you yourself felt very honored. You wrote to tell us: In the People's Political Consultative Conference, when Chairman Mao was elected as the Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, you were so moved that you shed tears. Because the revolutionary soldiers, after so many years of bloodshed and sacrifice, after the arduous struggle that humans could hardly endure, have now blossomed and borne fruit. You also told us that the conference gave you great inspiration, and you were willing to use your meager experience and ability to serve the people and strive for the construction of the new China.

    You fulfilled your promise: In the Ministry of Education, you served the people with your knowledge and the greatest effort. Although you missed your home in Shanghai, missed the millions of people in Shanghai who had received your education, and missed the cause in Shanghai, you, for the needs of the work, for the needs of the people, gave up your decision to return to America.

    Ah, Mother! On the evening of the fourth, you stopped breathing, you will never come back again.

    Rest in peace, great Mother! We will never let you down, all those who have received your education will not let you down, and all the educators who wish to learn from you forever will not let you down. We must learn from you: to be loyal, diligent and serve the people, to work hard in a serious and down-to-earth manner, and to have a spirit of struggle. We will practice your legacy and dedicate our whole heart and strength to the construction of the motherland. We will complete the cause you left behind.

    Mother, rest in peace!

    献给母亲
    孝
    慧端纯宣英
    当我们听到你患脑充血逝世在北京的时候，我们痛哭了，父亲痛哭了，亲戚朋友们哭了，一切愿意永远向你学习的教育工作者悲哀着，千千万万等待着你去工作的人民惋惜着！
    母亲，我们永远失去了你，母亲，千千万万的人民也永远失去了你。
    亲爱的母亲，你为什么离开得我们这样早？
    在烈日下，在暴风雨中，你辛劳，你奔走与工作；在黄昏，在深夜，你忘却了自己；考虑、计划着事业。
    在解放前一段苦难的岁月里，蒋匪帮种种的威胁，逼迫摧残着你的事业；民校要解散的消息使你几夜失眠，整日的奔走焦虑，使你增多了白发。——你在这时种下了很深的病根。
    当你看到你创办的事业一天天的扩大，民校由一所创办到一百几十所时，你消瘦的脸上充满欢欣。当同学们表现出高度的天才时，你憔悴的脸上现出了深刻的安慰。你培养了大批为人民服务的工作者，你培养了大批祖国的优秀儿女。你关心他们，爱护他们，教育他们。可是，现在呢？你永远离开了他们！
    受着反动派的逼迫，使你不得不离开祖国，到那遥远的国外去；爱你的人们送你到龙华机场，你说你就要回来的。大家就这样等着你；等着，等着，等着你回来。
    今年八月里，你果真回来了。回到了人民已经翻身做主的祖国的怀抱。你参加了奠定国基的人民政协。
    我们感到非常光荣，你自己也感到非常光荣。你写信告诉我们：在人民政协中，当毛主席当选为中华人民共和国中央人民政府的主席时，你感动得流下了眼泪。因为革命的战士们，经过了多少年的流血、牺牲，经过了人类几乎不能忍受的艰辛斗争，现在开花结果了。你又告诉我们，大会给你极大的感动，你愿以微薄的经验和能力，为人民服务，为新中国建设而努力。
    你实行了你的诺言：在教育部，你以你的学识和最大的努力为人民服务。虽然你想念着上海的家，想念着上海受过你教育的千万人民，想念着上海的事业，可是，你，为了工作的需要，为了人民的需要，你放弃了返美的决定。
    啊，母亲！在四号的晚上，你停止了呼吸，你永远不会再回来了。
    安息吧，伟大的母亲！我们决不会使你失望，所有受过你教育的人也不会使你失望，一切愿意永远向你学习的教育工作者，也不会使你失望。我们要学习你：忠贞勤劳为人民服务、认真踏实的苦干、奋斗的精神。我们会实践你的遗志，为祖国的建设，献出整个的心、力。我们会完成你留下的事业的。
    母亲，你安息吧！
