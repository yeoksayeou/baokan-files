    Chaoyang County Runs Training Class to Train Old Midwives
    [This Dispatch] In December of last year, Chaoyang County, Rehe Province, opened the first short-term maternal and child health training class to train 17 old midwives transferred from various districts. It lasted for four days and the results were very good. The trainees all expressed their determination to change the unhygienic midwifery methods of the past, and to return to convene old midwives in the entire district to promote maternal and child health. The following experiences were gained from this training class: 1. Because the trainees had not performed well in past deliveries and were transferred to receive training, they had many concerns in their thinking. It is necessary to first explain the significance of the training class to them so that they can study with peace of mind. 2. Investigate and understand their past delivery practices and their own pain, point out the root cause of the pain, and educate them. Among the seventeen trainees in this training class, a total of 119 children had been born, and 55 had died (19 died from convulsions, and some died from smallpox), accounting for 47 percent of births. Among the seventeen of them, fourteen had illnesses, all caused by unsanitary postpartum practices. Use these painful facts about themselves to illustrate the disadvantages of old midwifery methods and lack of hygiene. In this way, it is easy to raise their political consciousness, and new midwifery methods are easily accepted. 3. Teaching methods should take into account their poor health and poor memory. Lectures should be simple and focused, and repeated discussion should be held. The content of the training should not be too much; if there is too much, they will not remember it.

    朝阳县开办训练班训练旧接产妇
    【本报讯】热河朝阳县去年十二月开办了第一期妇婴卫生短期训练班，训练从各区调来的旧接产妇十七人，历时四天，结果很好。学员们都表示决心改变过去不讲卫生的接生方法，并要回去召集全区旧接产妇，宣传妇婴卫生。这次训练班得出几点经验：一、学员们因过去接生没接好，被调来受训，思想上多有顾虑，首先应向她们讲明训练班的意义，使她们安心学习。二、从调查了解她们过去接生的情况及其本身的痛苦，指出痛苦的根源，对她们进行教育。此次训练班十七个学员，共生过一百一十九个小孩，死了五十五个（十九个抽风死的，有的是出天花死的），占出生的百分之四十七。她们十七人中间，十四个有病，都是坐月子不讲卫生得的病。用她们本身的这些痛苦事实，说明旧法接生及不讲卫生的坏处。这样，容易提高她们的政治觉悟，新法接生容易被接受。三、教学方法，应照顾她们身体坏记忆力差的特点，讲课要简单有中心，反复讲多讨论。训练的内容亦不能太多，多了记不住。
