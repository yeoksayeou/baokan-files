    [Report from this newspaper] In December of last year, Jiao Zuo Coal Mine experienced a series of production sabotage incidents. On December 9th, at the No. 2 factory of the mine, mud workers started a fire for warmth, burning the shaft gate used for exiting the mine. The fire caused a work stoppage and a reduction of 75 tons of coal production. On the same day, at the No. 17 earth kiln of the No. 1 factory, disregarding the safety of the machinery (exposed to snow all night without covering or moving), the three-horsepower electric fan was burned out because no inspection was carried out before starting it. On the 10th, at the Beida incline of the No. 1 factory, 1,600 meters underground, more than ten cars of coal collapsed because supporting pillars were not erected in time, causing a reduction of 44 tons of coal production which required nine hours to repair. On the 11th, the 400-horsepower large water pump at the No. 2 factory of the No. 1 factory, had its metal bearing tiles melted because no oil was in the oil tank before starting it. On the same day, at the No. 17 mine of the No. 1 factory, 58 feet of steel wire rope on the Leizi slope was damaged. On the 14th, the car driver of the factory, relying on his high skills, neglected his duties and damaged a high car, affecting the factory's production and causing significant losses.

    The review of the reasons for the incidents shows that the main causes are irresponsibility towards state property, lack of care, negligence, failure to hand over duties during shift changes, lack of careful inspection and management of machines when starting them, and failure to report or deal with emerging problems. Secondly, the leadership of the cadres is not thorough, the control of regulations is not strict, there is a lack of inspection, insufficient education of workers, no timely correction of destructive phenomena, and no active transformation of old personnel. Thirdly, the cadres are politically numb, neglect the sabotage by bandits and special agents, do not pay attention to security work, and abuse enemy and puppet personnel and those with unclear backgrounds due to personal relationships.

    Based on the inspection results, the mine decided to conduct ideological inspections of cadres, eliminate political numbness and bureaucracy, strengthen the sense of responsibility for protecting state property, and strictly review and cleanse hidden enemy and puppet saboteurs. For general old employees, the mine will continue to follow the policy of unity and transformation and actively conduct education. It will mobilize workers to raise their awareness as masters of the country, strengthen labor discipline, strictly enforce various systems, and conduct strict inspections and strengthen education, especially for workers managing major machines. Strengthen security work, educate employees to recognize the destructive plots of bandits and special agents, strengthen the sense of responsibility for protecting state property, and launch a mass anti-spy and security movement. In order to prevent the continuation of such incidents, the following emergency measures have been taken:

    1. Move dangerous items, such as explosives, away from important machinery and gasoline to prevent accidents.
    2. Resolutely cleanse hidden enemy and puppet elements.
    3. Inspect important machinery.
    4. Investigate the causes, nature, and responsibilities of various incidents in order to deal with them.

    焦作煤矿检查破坏事件发生原因
    决加强爱护国家财产发动群众性防奸运动
    【本报讯】去年十二月间，焦作煤矿连续发生破坏生产事件，十二月九日，该矿二厂因泥水工人烤火，将出井之井栅烧毁，救火停工减产煤七十五吨。同日一厂十七号土窑，因不顾惜机器之安全（雪淋终夜不盖不转移），开动前不加检查，将三马力之电动风车烧毁。十日一厂井下北大?，在一千六百公尺处，因不及时架设顶柱，塌下十多车煤，九时修好减产煤四四吨。十一日一厂二号四百匹马力之大水泵，因开动前未检查，油箱无油，将五金轴瓦熔毁。同日一厂井下十七号，雷子坡钢丝绳损毁五十八尺。十四日该厂开车工人自恃技高，疏忽大意，损毁高车一架，影响该厂生产，损失甚巨。
    检讨事件发生原因，主要是对国家财产不负责，不爱惜，疏忽大意，上班下班不交代，开动机器时，检查管理机器不细心，发现征候不报告，不处理。其次是干部领导不深入，掌握制度不严格，不检查，对工人教育不够，对破坏现象未及时纠正，对旧人员不积极改造。再次是干部政治上麻痹，忽视匪特破坏，对保卫工作不注意，因私人关系而滥用敌伪人员，及来历不清分子。
    根据检查结果，该矿决定在干部思想上进行检查，肃清政治上的麻痹及官僚主义，加强爱护国家财产的责任心，严格审查清洗暗藏的敌伪破坏分子。对一般旧职员，仍本团结改造方针，积极进行教育。发动工人提高其主人翁的自觉性，加强劳动纪律，严格各种制度，特别对主要机器与管理之工人，要严格检查与加强教育。加强保卫工作，教育职工认识匪特的破坏阴谋，加强保卫国家财产的责任心，开展群众性的保卫防奸运动。为了防止事件继续发生，并采取了以下紧急措施：
    一、转移危险物品，如炸药离开重要机器和汽油，以防意外。
    二、坚决清洗暗藏的敌伪分子。
    三、对重要机器进行检查。
    四、追查各项事件发生之原因，性质及责任，以便处理。
