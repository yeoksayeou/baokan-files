Can China Still Tolerate the Existence of Foreign Barracks?
Ma Xulun

The Chinese people have broken the shackles of imperialism that have bound them for over a century and have stood up. We have used our own strength to expel the aggressive forces of imperialism from China, but we still need to completely eliminate the remaining privileges of imperialism in China.

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, representing the will of the Chinese people, determined the principles of the foreign policy of the People's Republic of China in its Common Program resolution. In addition to "opposing the aggressive and war policies of imperialism," it specifically stipulates: "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China shall review all treaties and agreements concluded between the Kuomintang government and foreign governments and, according to their content, shall either recognize, abolish, revise, or renegotiate them." This was announced at the time of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The "Boxer Protocol" of 1901 is a confession of aggression against China signed by the imperialists themselves, and it is also a type of "unequal treaty" pointed out by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Based on this treaty, they successively occupied land in Beijing to build barracks. Although the United States, Britain, France, and other countries declared the abolition of their privileges in China in 1943, these barracks that infringe upon Chinese sovereignty still exist. These barracks are all located in the so-called "Legation Quarter." The "Legation Quarter" is a vivid picture of the imperialist aggression against China in 1900. Even today, when we Chinese people pass through this "Legation Quarter," it is as if we have arrived in another country. The high, thick walls with dense gun emplacements and conspicuous artillery remind us of the past and increase our anger. We must wash away this historical shame without any doubt.

This time, our Beijing Military Control Commission resolutely took back the barracks of various imperialist countries in the "Legation Quarter" in order to safeguard national sovereignty. This is a just action representing the Chinese people who have stood up, and we, the people, absolutely and enthusiastically support it.

Regarding this matter, we must recall that after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, it was the first to declare to China that it would abandon the rights acquired through aggression in China during the Tsarist era. However, the United States, Britain, France, and other countries still retain barracks in the "Legation Quarter." This proves the essential difference between socialist countries and imperialist countries. The Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with us on the second day of the founding of the People's Republic of China and has continuously supported China's due rights in the United Nations, while the United States, Britain, France, and other countries have done the opposite. After hesitating for a long time, Britain, which recently declared its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with China and sever relations with the Kuomintang reactionary remnants, actually helped the Kuomintang reactionary remnants by abstaining from the vote in the United Nations on the resolution requested by China and the Soviet Union to expel the illegal representative of the Kuomintang reactionary remnants, Jiang Tingfu. This is an unwise action under the control of American imperialism, and we can only feel sorry for it on his behalf. However, if we make a comparison with the Soviet Union, it is a clear contrast between active friendship and insufficient friendship, socialism and imperialism.

As for American imperialism's distortion of the facts regarding our recovery of the barracks and its threat and coercion by saying that it "will withdraw all American personnel from Communist China," this is the consistent style of imperialism, but the Chinese people and the Chinese people's government will never pay attention to this.

Finally, we solemnly declare that we must completely eliminate the remaining privileges of imperialism in China.

    中国还容许有外国兵营存在吗？
    马叙伦
    中国人民已打破了一百多年来帝国主义的枷锁而站起来了。我们已用自己的力量把帝国主义的侵略势力驱逐出中国，但我们还需要把帝国主义留在中国的残余特权消灭干净。
    代表中国人民意志的中国人民政治协商会议在其决议的共同纲领中，决定了中华人民共和国的外交政策的原则。除了“反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策”以外，还具体的规定：“对于国民党政府与外国政府所订立的各项条约和协定，中华人民共和国中央人民政府应加以审查，按其内容，分别予以承认，或废除，或修改，或重订。”这是中华人民共和国成立的时候已宣布了的。
    一九○一年的“辛丑条约”，是各帝国主义自己签字的侵略中国的供状，也是孙中山先生所指出的“不平等条约”的一种，他们根据了这个条约，在北京先后占地建造兵营，一九四三年，美、英、法等国虽经声明废除在华特权，但这种侵犯中国主权的兵营，依然存在。这种兵营都在所谓“使馆区”内。“使馆区”便是各帝国主义国家在一九○○年侵略中国的一幅活生生的图画，至今我们中国人民经这个“使馆区”，犹像到了一个别的国家，那高厚的围墙上密集的枪眼和显然触目的炮台，都叫我们想起前情，增加后愤，这个历史的污辱，我们必须给他浣洗得干净，是无疑问的。
    这次我们北京市军管会为维护国家的主权，断然收回各帝国主义国家在“使馆区”内的兵营，这是代表站起来了的中国人民的正义行动，我们人民绝对予以热烈拥护。
    我们对于这件事，要回想到苏联十月革命后，就首先对中国声明放弃帝俄时代在中国以侵略取得的权利，而美、英、法等国家，至今还保有在“使馆区”的兵营，这证明了社会主义国家和帝国主义国家在本质上的区别，苏联在中华人民共和国成立的第二日，就和我们建立邦交，并且在联合国里不断地支持中国应得的权利，而美、英、法等国家，又适得其反。徘徊已久，而最近已向我们中国声明愿意建立邦交并和国民党反动残余断绝关系的英国这次在联合国中对中国和苏联要求的开除国民党反动残余的非法代表蒋廷黻的决议时，以弃权的方式，实际上帮助了国民党反动残余，这是他在美帝控制下的不明智的行动，我们只有代他惋惜。可是，如果和苏联作一对照，又是积极友好和不够友好、社会主义和帝国主义的显明对比。
    至于美帝国主义对于我们收回兵营的事，还在歪曲事实，并且拿“就要从共产党中国撤退所有美国人员”来恐吓和要挟，这是帝国主义一贯的作风，但中国人民和中国人民的政府，决不理会这一套。
    最后，我们严正地声明，帝国主义留在中国的残余特权，我们必须把他消灭干净。
