    Nine Hundred Tons of Iron Fines Turn Over
    A Record of Wang Yunhua's Successful Rationalization Proposal
    After the railway machine factory launched the rationalization proposal movement, Wang Yunhua, a veteran master in the casting iron team of the foundry, kept muttering about the cast iron fines that had been mixed with coal ash for over forty years. Every time he passed by them, his heart ached. How wonderful it would be if these nine hundred tons of iron fines could all be turned into raw materials!

    He couldn't sleep well for several nights, constantly thinking about this large pile of rusty iron fines. Finally, he mustered up his courage and wrote a proposal to try smelting the cast iron fines. The factory leadership attached great importance to his proposal, and the technicians in the efficiency section also believed that it should be possible to smelt them in theory. After research, they immediately helped him begin the experiment, providing him with special convenience in terms of tools, coke, and power.

    The first experiment was on December 26th of last year, using the old method. One hundred kilograms of iron fines (material) were divided into four layers and placed in the blast furnace, with eight kilograms of crushed coke placed on each layer. When starting the furnace, Master Wang added materials to the blast furnace while someone watched the tuyere below. Master Wang thought to himself: "The factory has provided so much convenience, it has to work!" But he was disappointed. The iron fines were all powder and difficult to ventilate. They were stuck together with the crushed coke and could not be smelted. However, he gained an experience: if the materials were added properly, success was guaranteed.

    That night, he tossed and turned in bed, thinking: "According to 'regularization' (rules), the blast furnace should use hot air. Hot air is gentler and easier to smelt, while cold air easily blows away the iron fines and consumes more." The next day, he went to the factory without even washing his face. Since the furnace could not be converted to hot air immediately, he accepted his previous experience and changed the material charging procedure. This time, he added 220 kilograms of material. Geng Yunsheng, the director of the foundry, personally came to help him watch the fire. He put in 30 kilograms of material and 18 kilograms of crushed coke at a time. Iron slag came out, but it was as thick as paste. It was estimated that the finished product would only be 65 percent, but it was a great improvement compared to the previous time.

    After the New Year, he kept talking about changing to hot air. On the morning of the 4th, Master Wang conducted the third experiment. This time, many people came to watch, including the factory director, the Party's organization committee member, the union chairman, and others. Everyone was watching him, and Master Wang felt unspeakably happy. This time, he added a ton of material. First, he put 40 kilograms of larger pieces of coke as the bottom carbon. The first four rows were filled with 54 kilograms of material, and then 10 kilograms of coke. Ten minutes after the wind started, iron slag came out, but within half an hour, the first four rows were added too quickly and too much, resulting in the fire being suppressed and the wind not coming up. At about fifty minutes, the iron slag flowed down with a gurgling sound, sparks flew everywhere, and Master Wang and the visitors jumped up with joy.

    The three experiments were successful. On the 11th, I met Master Wang. He said very humbly, "It's nothing. This is just a little bit of effort that I should contribute to the country. From now on, this stuff (cast iron fines) will no longer be disliked." He led me to the sand casting room and pointed with a smile to a grey, brick-like thing and told me, "This is it! It's a little too hard and not easy to turn or plane." He said, "This is because it lacks silicon. It's good for making steel, but there are some problems with making parts." He was confident in these three experiments. As long as he could buy silicon, the problem could be solved. The cold air furnace is really not suitable now. He plans to open a hot air furnace in February or March of this year, so that the smelting of cast iron fines can be "regularized." According to what his master taught him, some charcoal should be used, but he is still figuring out if this method will work.

    In the second half of last year, he used white iron to smelt cylinder liners, expansion rings, and valve stem sleeves. The finished products had fewer sand holes and the quality was quite good; but he didn't dare to say that he could smelt the cast iron fines. The success of this year's experiment has boosted his greater courage and ambition. He said, "Don't tell anyone, I'm planning to smelt wrought iron fines and 'menma steel'. Whether it will succeed or not is another matter." He said: If wrought iron fines can be smelted, then those rotten iron scraps in the garbage bins on the streets will have a way out. Master Wang is fifty years old this year. For the sake of the country's construction, he is planning his efforts with no signs of aging. When I said goodbye to him, from his confident expression, I saw the bright future of China's industrial construction.

### 九百吨铁末翻身了  记王云华合理化建议的成功

    九百吨铁末翻身了
    记王云华合理化建议的成功
    铁路机厂展开合理化建议运动以后，铸工所铸铁班老师傅王云华叨念着四十几年就和煤灰混在一起的生铁末。他一走过那儿，心里就疼得慌。要是这九百多吨铁末都化成原料会多好哟？
    几宿没睡好，老惦着这一大堆长满锈的铁末。最后他鼓足了劲儿，写上这个建议，试办化生铁末。厂部很重视他这建议，效率股的技术员们也认为理论上应该化得开。经过研究马上帮他着手试验，而且在工具、焦炭和动力上特别给他便利。
    第一次试验是去年十二月二十六号，用的老规矩，以一百公斤铁末（料），分做四层放进鼓风炉，每层搁上八公斤碎焦炭。开炉时，王师傅在鼓风炉上配料，下面一个人看风眼。王师傅心里想：厂部给了这末些方便，要下得来才行哩！结果他失望了，铁末都是粉粒，不易透风，它和焦炭碎块结在一起，化不下来。但他得到一个经验：如果料下得好准保成功。
    这一宿他躺在炕上翻来覆去地想：“按‘正规化’（规矩）鼓风炉应该是热风，热风柔和，容易化，冷风容易把铁末吹跑，消耗大”。第二天他脸也不洗就进了厂。炉子一时改不成热风，他接受上次经验，改变了配料手续。他这次配上二百二十公斤料，铸工所的主任耿运升亲自来帮他看火候。他一次放三十公斤料，十八公斤焦炭碎块。铁水是下来了，像浆糊样地稠，估计成品只有百分之六十五，但是比较前次进步多了。
    过了新年，他老叨念着改用热风的问题。四日上午，王师傅作了第三次试验，这一次来看的人很多，厂长、党的组织委员、工会主任等，大家都望着他，王师傅心里有说不出的高兴。这次他续上一吨料，先放四十公斤块头较大的焦炭作底炭，前四排续料五十四公斤，再放焦炭十公斤。开风以后十来分钟，铁水下来了，但半个钟头内前四排下得太急，又下得太多，结果把火压住了，风上不来，到五十分钟光景铁水哗哗哗的往下流，火星飞溅，王师傅和参观的人都高兴得跳了起来。
    三次试验成功了，十一号我会见了王师傅，他很谦虚地向我说：“算不得什么，这是自己对国家应尽的一点力。往后，这东西（生铁末）不再使人讨嫌了。”他引我到翻砂房，笑指着一块像砖头一样灰勃勃的东西告诉我：“就是这！太硬一点儿，旋、刨不灵。”他说“这是缺乏硅素的缘故，作炼钢材料很好，配制零件差池一些。”这三次试验他有了把握，只要买得到硅素，问题就可以解决。现在用冷风炉实在不合适，他打算在今年二、三月里开一个热风炉，这样化生铁末就能“正规化”，根据他师傅教他的，应该用一些木炭，这法子究竟行不行他还在捉摸。
    去年下半年他利用白铁化过汽缸套、涨圈、汽丝套等，化出来的成品砂眼少，货色还很漂亮；但他还不敢说能把生铁末化出来。今年这个试验的成功，鼓起了他更大的勇气和雄心。他说：“你别告诉旁人，我计算化熟铁末和闷马钢。成功不成功是后话。”他说：要是熟铁末化得下来，在街头垃圾箱里的那些烂铁家伙都就有了出路。王师傅今年五十岁了，为了国家的生产建设，他是毫无老态地计划着自己的努力目标，和他告别时，从他那种充满信心的表情中，我看见了新中国工业建设未来的光明远景。
