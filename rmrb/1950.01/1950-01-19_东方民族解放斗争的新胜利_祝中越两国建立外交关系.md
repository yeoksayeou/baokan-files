    A New Victory in the Eastern National Liberation Struggle
    ——Congratulations on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Vietnam

    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announced to the world on the 14th that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the sole legitimate government of all the people of Vietnam and is prepared to establish diplomatic relations with any government willing to cooperate with it on the basis of equality and mutual respect for Vietnam's national sovereignty and territory, in order to jointly safeguard world peace and democracy. On the 15th, Minister Huang Minhjian of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent a telegram to our Central People's Government requesting the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. Minister Zhou Enlai of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied on the 18th, expressing China's warm welcome to the establishment of friendly diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    The Chinese people warmly welcome the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as our friendly neighbor, and firmly believe that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Vietnam is a major event in the Eastern national liberation struggle. The establishment of Sino-Vietnamese diplomatic relations is built on the basis that the Chinese revolution has basically achieved victory and that most of the territory of Vietnam has been liberated. The victory of the Chinese revolution and the liberation of 475 million people have opened a huge and irreparable gap in the imperialist front in the entire East, while the liberation of most of Vietnam with its 26 million people has driven a sharp wedge into the imperialist front in Southeast Asia. The establishment of Sino-Vietnamese diplomatic relations cannot but be a new and important encouragement to the liberation struggles of the oppressed nations in Southeast Asia.

    There is a long-standing friendship between the people of Vietnam and the people of China. In the century of imperialist aggression against Asia, the people of China and Vietnam jointly suffered and resisted imperialist oppression. Under the attack of Japanese aggressors, the people of both China and Vietnam developed people's revolutionary armed forces to resist imperialism, and relied on these revolutionary armed forces to achieve today's victory. The People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam both belong to the great world democratic and peace camp, which is waging a resolute and victorious struggle against the imperialist reactionary forces. The friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people, which was established in a common destiny, has now developed into friendly diplomatic relations. We firmly believe that the increasingly close friendship between China and Vietnam will make a powerful contribution to the common interests of the people of China and Vietnam and to the cause of world peace and democracy.

### 东方民族解放斗争的新胜利——祝中越两国建立外交关系

    东方民族解放斗争的新胜利
    ——祝中越两国建立外交关系
    越南民主共和国政府已于十四日向全世界宣布：越南民主共和国政府是越南全体人民唯一的合法政府，并准备与任何愿在平等和互相尊重越南国家主权及领土的基础上与之合作的政府建立外交关系，以谋共同保卫世界的和平民主。十五日越南民主共和国政府外交部黄明鉴部长电达我中央人民政府要求和中华人民共和国建立外交关系，我外交部周恩来部长已于十八日复电表示我国热烈欢迎与越南民主共和国建立友好的外交关系。
    中国人民热烈欢迎越南民主共和国作为我们的友好的邻邦，并且深信中越建立邦交是东方民族解放斗争中一件大事。中越邦交是建筑在中国革命已经基本上取得胜利，而越南大部分领土已经获得解放的基础之上。中国革命的胜利，四万万七千五百万人口的解放，使帝国主义在全东方的战线，打开了巨大的无法填补的缺口，而二千六百万人口的越南的大部解放，则对帝国主义在东南亚的战线插进了一个尖锐的楔子。中越邦交的建立，对于东南亚各被压迫民族的解放斗争，不能不是一个新的重要的鼓舞。
    越南人民和中国人民之间，是存在着悠久的友谊的。在帝国主义侵略亚洲的世纪中，中越两国人民共同遭受了并且反抗了帝国主义的压迫。在日本侵略者进攻之下，中越两国人民都发展了反抗帝国主义的人民革命武装力量，并依靠这种革命武装力量获得了今天的胜利。中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国都属于伟大的世界民主和平阵营，这个阵营正在向帝国主义反动势力进行着坚决的胜利的斗争。中越人民在共同命运中所建立起来的友谊，现在已经发展为友好的邦交了。我们深信日益密切的中越友谊，必能对中越两国人民的共同利益以及世界和平民主事业作有力的贡献。
