    On the Harms of Tobacco
    British Deputy Prime Minister Morrison, in a speech at a meeting in Lancashire, urged the British people to put the interests of the nation above all else… and smoke less.

    Mr. Morrison estimated that in the three months from April to June of this year, the money spent on smoking in Britain would exceed four million pounds per month compared to 1935.

    "If we continue to smoke so much," Morrison said, "then all the dollars we earn from exports in half a year will only be enough to pay for one year's worth of tobacco imported from the United States."

    Of course, Morrison did not mention that the reason why the British have been smoking mainly expensive imported goods for so long is that one of the conditions of the loan from the United States in 1945 was to restrict the cultivation of tobacco within the British Empire, which is why Britain had to rely on American tobacco.

    It is not just that smoking is harmful to the British. According to Morrison, the British people spend too much money on entertainment, games, and other non-essential items such as alcohol, movies, horse racing, and so on.

    In Morrison's view, the British are enjoying themselves too much. Now that the country is facing a difficult time, it is time to end all merrymaking.

    The Labor rulers, who have subordinated Britain to the interests of American monopoly enterprises, plunging the British people into a precarious abyss of unemployment and poverty, and are not even self-sufficient, now actually want the British people to abandon their essential needs and entertainment.

    That government's "economic" program of cutting expenditures on housing, healthcare, and education, etc., demonstrates how the Labor Party's servants under the American capitalists are making a satirical attack on the living standards of the British working class.

### 谈烟草的害处

    谈烟草的害处
    不列颠的副首相摩里逊，有一次在兰开夏的一个会上演讲，吁请英国人把国家的利益放在一切之上……少抽一点烟。
    摩里逊先生估计在今年四——六月三个月中，英国吸烟所费的钱，如与一九三五年比较，每个月要超过四百万英镑。
    “假如我们还继续吸这样多的烟，”摩里逊说：“那么我们半年里全部输出所赚来的美元，只够支付由美国输入一年用的烟草。”
    当然，摩里逊并没有附带说一说，这多时以来，英国人所吸的烟，主要的是价钱昂贵的进口货，其原因是一九四五年向美国借款时有一条件，限制在大英帝国内部推广烟草的种植，就因为这样，英国就得依赖美国的烟草了。
    还不单是吸烟对英国人有害处，照摩里逊的说法，英国老百姓花在娱乐，游戏，以及其他非必需品如酒、电影、跑马等等上面的钱实在太多了。
    照摩里逊的想法，英国人享受得太多了。现在面临国家多难之秋，该是终止一切寻欢作乐的时候了。
    工党的统治者，把英国附属于美国垄断事业利益之下，将英国人民投入危机四伏的深渊，失业，穷困，还不自足，他们现在居然要英国人民抛弃他们主要必需品与娱乐。
    那个削减房屋，保健，教育等开支的政府“经济”纲领，就如是地说明了美国资本家手下的工党仆从们，正向着英国工人阶级的生活水准，作讽刺式的袭击。
