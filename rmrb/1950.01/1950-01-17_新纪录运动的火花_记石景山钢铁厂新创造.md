Sparks of the New Record Movement
Recording the New Creations of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

An Astonishing Number

At the end of last December, the No. 1 blast furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant created a new record of 331 tons of daily output, an increase of 83 percent over the highest output (180 tons) during the Japanese puppet and Kuomintang rule, and more than double the plant's usual output of about 150 tons (with the same quality). Compared with the plant's cost of producing 160 tons per day last summer, the cost per ton was reduced by 21 percent, equivalent to 503 jin of millet. Calculated based on the new record daily output, more than 166,400 jin of millet are saved in one day. This is an astonishing number!

Breaking the Cage of Conservatism

Although the creation of this record only lasted for a week, it went through some difficulties. In June last year, the plant suffered a fire, and a negative mentality of fearing mistakes and fearing responsibility arose among the leading cadres: "Seek no merit, but seek no fault," cautiously content with the status quo, the production level stagnated at 130-140 tons per day, far below the level during the Japanese puppet and Kuomintang rule. Although the technical personnel also knew that the output could be increased, they were concerned that the raw material supply would not be able to keep up, and were content with "less trouble is better than more," and "do whatever the higher authorities tell us to do," and dared not actively put forward opinions to the leaders. Conservatism was very strong. A week ago, the ideological situation of the leadership was still like this. The main purpose of creating this new record was to fight against the ideas of conservatism and empiricism, and to liberate the general technical personnel, workers, and even some leaders of the iron smelting plant from the cage of conservatism left over by imperialism and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie in terms of production technology concepts.

The new record was suggested by the Soviet expert hired by the plant. After carefully studying the efficiency of the machinery and equipment, the output record, the blower of the blast furnace, the boiler room, the supply and transportation conditions of raw materials, etc., he proposed to use other auxiliary machines—using the No. 3 blower instead of the No. 1 blower (the original air volume was small), and using the No. 2 boiler room instead of the No. 1 boiler room (the original power was small). According to the advanced Soviet science and technology, using an effective volume calculation method, he determined that even under China's relatively backward conditions today, adding more scrap iron to supplement the shortage of raw materials can still break through the original standard of 250 tons of the blast furnace's maximum efficiency and increase the daily output to 300 tons. He also encouraged everyone with the creative spirit unique to socialist countries, saying: "We iron producers should use all our strength to maximize the efficiency of the furnace." He helped the leadership dispel the concern that the supply of raw materials would be insufficient if production increased.

Under the inspiration of the Soviet expert, the thinking of the main responsible cadres became clear, and they were determined to adhere to and implement it, ensuring the creation.

However, the remaining thoughts of conservatism still often attacked them during the creation of new records. Generally, technical personnel were convinced in theory, but they doubted whether it could be realized. What worried them most were two figures: one was the highest daily output of 190 tons during the Japanese puppet and Kuomintang rule, and the other was that the original design standard of the furnace was "250." Therefore, in their active work, they always held a "try it out" attitude. The workers who were trying to increase production were also kindly worried about the furnace, fearing that it would be damaged due to excessive production. This is because they did not understand that today's scientific and technological level has already been greatly improved, and some of the regulations of bourgeois science and technology themselves contain backward conservatism. It was not until the new record was completed that this kind of conservatism and empiricism was completely crushed.

Close Coordination

In order to complete the new record, the leadership convened various meetings and proposed close internal and external cooperation to avoid affecting the entire plan due to the failure of a certain department to complete its task. Under a common goal, all the technical personnel and workers of the plant actively worked hard to complete their tasks. The power plant and the machine repair plant cooperated with the iron smelting plant to overhaul the No. 3 blower and the No. 2 boiler room, solved the circulating water problem, rushed to repair the scraper, the exhaust fan, various gas meters, and the steel pipes for water delivery, overcame various difficulties, and completed the work in two or three days. Other preparations, such as manpower and machine conditions, were also effectively done. This was an important factor in ensuring the completion of the new record.

Great: The Workers' Production Enthusiasm

In this new record movement, the workers' production enthusiasm was unparalleled. In order to ensure the increase in air volume, Hou Decheng, a day shift worker in the hot blast furnace, studied the method of using the vent door and increasing the air inlet. After getting off work, he told the second shift about the results, and the second shift passed it on to the third shift. They connected with each other and studied together, and the air volume increased from 500 cubic meters to 650 cubic meters, meeting the air volume supply. The workers in the No. 2 boiler room and the No. 3 blower did not want to leave when they got off work. The workers in the tapping area were sweating profusely in the cold winter even though they were only wearing single clothes. They said: "It is tiring, but it is pleasant to see more iron coming out!" In order to ensure the delivery of materials by the winch, the workers enthusiastically went to see the funnel of the blast furnace countless times. Once, a worker was poisoned by coal gas because he was too busy to stand in the wrong wind direction. Yang Lu, the leader of the internship team and a Communist Party member, rushed to the rescue regardless of his own safety. He himself was also poisoned, but he finally rescued the worker. This high degree of class friendship further enhanced the workers' unity and production mood.

New Creations Bring New Hope

Although there were still some shortcomings in this movement, and it was a bit hurried and not very planned, after this new creation, the entire plant underwent a revolution in production technology thinking. Zhen Yulin, the deputy engineer, told the reporter: "It is wrong to measure ourselves with the production viewpoint of the bourgeoisie today." The workers said: "We used to think that the Japanese production technology was 'so great', but now we ourselves are better than them!"

In the advanced areas of Northeast China, the new record has become a common movement, but in North China or the whole country, this new record is still a spark. But we have already seen the confidence and strength of the Chinese working class under the leadership of the Communist Party. Through this spark, we see the prospect of China's industry.

    新纪录运动的火花
    记石景山钢铁厂新创造
    一个惊人的数字
    去年十二月底，石景山钢铁厂的第一号炼铁炉，创造了日产三百三十一吨的新纪录，较日伪与国民党统治时期，最高产量（一八○吨）提高了百分之八十三，比平时该厂一百五十吨左右的产量提高了一倍多（质量相同）。这个数字，若与该厂去夏日产一百六十吨的成本作比，则每吨减低成本百分之二十一，计折小米五○三斤。按新纪录日产量计算，一天即节省了十六万六千四百余斤小米，这是一个惊人的数字呵。
    打破保守主义的囚笼
    创造这个纪录虽仅历时一周，但经过了一些困难：去年六月间，该厂曾经失火，领导干部中产生了一种怕出错误，怕负责任的消极思想：“不求有功，但求无过”，小心翼翼安于现状，生产水平长期停滞于日产一百三四十吨，远不及日伪、国民党统治时期。技术人员虽然也知道产量还可以提高，但顾虑原料供应不上，安于：“多一事不如少一事”，“上边叫怎样就怎样”，而不敢积极向领导者提出意见，保守主义非常浓厚。一周前，领导思想状况尚且如此。这次创造新纪录，主要的是和保守主义与经验主义的思想作斗争，在生产技术观念上，把一般技术人员、工人，甚至炼铁厂的某些领导者，从帝国主义与官僚资产阶级所遗留下来的保守主义的囚笼解放出来。
    新纪录是该厂聘请的苏联专家所建议的，他到工厂仔细地研究了机器设备效能，产量纪录，炼铁炉的送风机、锅炉房，原料的供应及运输等条件之后，提议运用其他配合机器——用第三号送风机代替一号送风机（原送风量小），用第二号锅炉房代替一号锅炉房（原动力小）。根据苏联先进的科学技术，使用有效的容积计算法，断定即使在中国今天较为落后的条件下，多加废铁补充原料的不足，仍可突破炼铁炉原定最高效能二百五十吨的标准，提高日产量至三百吨。并以社会主义国家所特有的创造精神鼓励大家说：“我们出铁的生产者，应以自己全部的力量，使炉子的效能发挥得最大。”帮助领导解除了怕生产提高原料供应不足的顾虑。
    在苏联专家的启发之下，主要负责干部的思想明确起来，下定决心坚持贯彻，保证了这个创造。
    但是保守主义的残余思想，在创造新纪录的过程中，仍常来袭击他们。一般技术人员在理论上是说通了，但怀疑着是否可以实现。特别使他们担心的是两个数字：一个是日伪和国民党统治时期最高日产量为一九○吨，另一个是原来炉子设计最高标准是“二五○”。因此，他们在积极工作中，总是抱着“试试看”的态度。他们竭力希望提高生产的工人们，也好心的耽忧着那个炉子，害怕它因生产过多而损坏了。这都是因为不了解今天科学技术水平早已提高了，而资产阶级科学技术的某些规定，本身就含有落后的保守性。直到新纪录完成，这种保守主义、经验主义的思想才被完全粉碎。
    密切配合
    为了完成新纪录，领导上曾召集各种会议，提出内外部密切配合，不使因某个部门未完成任务而影响整个计划，全厂技术人员与工人，在共同目标下，都积极努力完成自己的任务。电力厂与机修厂配合炼铁厂，检修三号送风机与二号锅炉房，解决了循环水，抢修了刮瓦、抽气机、各种气表与送水的钢管，克服各种困难，在两三天内即告完成。其他如人力以及机器条件的准备，也都有效的做到了，这是保证新纪录完成的一个重要因素。
    伟大：工人的生产热忱
    在这次新纪录运动中，工人的生产热忱是无比的。为了保证送风量的增加，热风炉日班工人侯德成研究了使用放风门和加大空气口的方法，他下班后，即将结果告诉第二班，又由第二班传给第三班，互相衔接，共同研究，送风量遂由五百立方米增至六百五十立方米，满足了风量的供应。二号锅炉房和三号送风机的工人下班时，都不想走。出铁场的工人在严寒的冬天，仅着单衣仍忙得满头大汗，他们说：“累是累，看到多出铁就痛快！”为了保证绞车送料，工人们热情地无数次地去看高炉的漏斗，有一次，某工人因忙得站错了风向而中煤毒，实习小组长、共产党员杨禄奋不顾身前往抢救，他自己也中了毒，但终于将该工人救出。由于这种高度的阶级友爱，更提高了工人的团结与生产情绪。
    新创造带来新希望
    此次运动中，虽然还存在着一些缺点，有点手忙脚乱，不是很有计划的；但是经过这次新创造，全厂在生产技术思想上来了一次革命，副工程师甄玉林告记者说：“今天再拿资产阶级的生产观点来衡量我们自己，是错误的。”工人们说：“以前认为日本人生产技术‘多棒’，现在我们自己比他们更行了！”
    在先进地区的东北，新纪录已成为普遍运动，而在华北或全国来说，这个新纪录还是一点星星之火。但是我们已经看到了在共产党领导之下，中国工人阶级的自信与力量，透过这朵火花，我们看到了新中国工业的远景。
