    Q&A on the "Colombo Conference"
    Q: Why is the British Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference also called the Colombo Conference? Which countries participated?
    A: The British Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference was held in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, on the ninth of this month, so it can also be called the Colombo Conference. The participants included the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, South Africa, etc., all of which belong to the "British Commonwealth."
    Q: Why was the Colombo Conference held at this time?
    A: We, the Chinese people, drove away the US imperialist aggressors and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek, and achieved a great victory. This victory has created a brand new situation in the entire Asia; it has greatly encouraged the national liberation movements in Southeast Asian countries and strengthened their struggle for national liberation. The foundation of the imperialists' enslavement and rule in Southeast Asia has been shaken at its roots. This has caused extreme panic among the British imperialists, who are trying to save their doomed defeat. This is the reason for the convening of this conference.
    Q: This reason is easy to understand, but newspapers have also reported that US imperialism is also strengthening its aggression against Southeast Asia. What is the relationship between them—Britain and the United States?
    A: Because the economic crisis of the capitalist world is inevitably approaching, US imperialism intends to evade this crisis by shifting the burden of the economic crisis onto the working people at home and the people of other countries. It wants to expand markets, increase investment, and seize military bases not only in Europe but also in Southeast Asia. Thus, it is setting its sights on Southeast Asia, which was originally in the sphere of influence of the British Empire. In the past, Canada of the British Commonwealth, as well as present-day Australia and New Zealand, have gradually detached themselves from the British Empire and thrown themselves into the embrace of the US Empire. The power of US monopoly capital is very great in these three places. The bond between the "British Commonwealth" has many flaws and is about to collapse. The Colombo Conference also vainly attempts to "unite" the British Commonwealth tightly, in order to exploit the people of the colonies and confront the US Empire in Southeast Asia.
    Q: What is the main purpose of British imperialism?
    A: In a word, it is how to "maintain the British imperialist group's colonial rule and interests in Southeast Asia." Around this center, they will certainly discuss how to "launch an offensive against the Asian national liberation movement and organize an aggressive group like the North Atlantic bloc" (Pravda International Commentary).
    Q: So, we have a better understanding of our view on the Colombo Conference. What attitude should we take towards it?
    A: We, peace-loving people, must be vigilant. Since the theme of the Colombo Conference is an evil conspiracy of how imperialism can maintain its continued oppression of the people of Southeast Asia, we should expose its reactionary nature and make it clear to the people of the world that we must not have any illusions about imperialism, but must strengthen the national liberation struggle and fundamentally defeat the imperialist forces and the reactionaries in various countries. Only in this way can we embark on the road to independence, democracy, freedom, and happiness.

### “科伦坡会议”的问答

    “科伦坡会议”的问答
    问：为什么英联邦外长会议又叫做科伦坡会议？参加的都是那些国家？
    答：英联邦外长会议本月九日在锡兰首府科伦坡召开，所以又可以叫做科伦坡会议。参加的有英国、加拿大、澳大利亚、印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰、南非等，都是属于“大英联邦”的国家。
    问：科伦坡会议为什么在这个时候召开呢？
    答：我们中国人民，赶走了美帝国主义侵略势力及其走狗蒋介石，取得了伟大的胜利。这个胜利就使整个亚洲出现了一个崭新的局面；大大鼓舞了东南亚各国的民族解放运动，加强了他们争取民族解放的斗争。帝国主义者在东南亚的奴役统治基础，从根本处动摇了。这就使得英帝国主义惊恐万分，设法来挽救其注定了的失败。这个会议的召开道理在此。
    问：这个道理好懂得，但是报纸上也报道过美帝也正加强向东南亚的侵略，他们——英国和美国——之间的关系怎样呢？
    答：由于资本主义世界经济危机已无可避免地迫近了，美帝国主义想逃避这个危机便打算把经济危机的担子放到国内劳动人民以及别国的人民身上。它不仅在欧洲、而且也在东南亚各地，想扩大市场，增多投资，夺占军事基地。于是便向原来英帝势力范围东南亚打主意。过去大英联邦的加拿大，以及现在的澳大利亚、纽西兰，都日渐脱离英帝投入美帝怀抱，美帝独占资本势力在这三处很大。“大英联邦”之间的这一条系带，破绽已多，差不多就要崩了。科伦坡会议也妄想把大英联邦“团结”得紧紧的，借此来压榨殖民地人民，并同美帝在东南亚对抗。
    问：英帝国主义主要的目的何在呢？
    答：一句话，就是怎样能够“保持英帝国主义集团在东南亚各地的殖民地统治及其利益”。围绕住这一个中心，他们必将讨论怎样“发动对亚洲民族解放运动的攻势以及组织像北大西洋集团一样的侵略集团”（真理报国际述评）。
    问：那么，我们对科伦坡会议的看法比较了解一些了，我们对它应持什么态度呢？
    答：我们爱好和平的人民，必须提高警惕。科伦坡会议的主题既是帝国主义如何保持继续压榨东南亚人民的一种罪恶阴谋，我们就应该揭发它的反动性质，让全世界人民明白，对帝国主义不能存任何幻想，必须加强民族解放斗争，根本上打垮帝国主义势力及在各国的反动派，只有这样才能走上独立、民主、自由、幸福的大道。
