    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 8th: The New York Worker reported from the Electric News Agency in New York on the 5th: The membership figures recently released by the American Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) reveal that the CIO membership, under the leadership of right-wing elements like Murray, has sharply declined. The CIO, which once boasted a membership of over six million, is now confirmed by the CIO's financial report released during Christmas to have no more than three and a half million members.
    The CIO membership has been gradually decreasing since 1947, when the reactionary policies of the CIO's right-wing leaders intensified. The CIO recently expelled 450,000 members of the militant United Electrical Workers Union and the Farm Equipment Workers Union on charges of "Communism."

    反动右翼分子领导下
    美产联会员锐减
    【新华社北京八日电】据电通社纽约五日讯：纽约工人日报报道，美国产业职工大会最近发表的会员数目透露：在莫莱等右翼分子领导下的产联会员已经锐减。产联以前曾号称拥有会员六百万以上，但根据产联在圣诞节所发表的财政报告证实：产联的会员已不超过三百五十万。
    自一九四七年产联右翼领导分子的反动政策益形加剧以来，产联的会员人数一直是逐渐减少的。产联近来曾以“共产主义”的罪名开除了四十五万富于战斗性的联合电气工人工会和农业装备工人工会的会员。
