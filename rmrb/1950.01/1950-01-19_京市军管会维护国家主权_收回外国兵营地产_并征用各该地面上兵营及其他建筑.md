Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 18th: The Beijing Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has recovered the former U.S., French, and Dutch barracks land within the city, and has requisitioned the barracks and other buildings on said land for military needs.

　　The Military Control Commission issued a public notice as early as January 6th, stating: "1. In the past, certain foreign countries, taking advantage of the so-called 'right to station troops' in unequal treaties, occupied land and built barracks in Beijing. Now that the unequal treaties have been abolished, the property rights of this land should be recovered. 2. The issue of real estate arising from the recovery of land rights, such as barracks and other buildings built on this land, will be resolved by our government separately. 3. Currently, these barracks and other buildings will be requisitioned for military needs. 4. This requisition will be implemented seven days after the date of this announcement." On the 7th, the Military Control Commission issued orders to the former U.S., French, and Dutch (occupying the former German barracks) consuls, instructing them to appoint dedicated personnel to be responsible for handing over the former U.S., French, and Dutch barracks on schedule, without delay.

　　After receiving the order, the former U.S., French, and Dutch consuls attempted to delay and resist, citing the unequal treaties signed with the Kuomintang reactionaries. However, due to the solemn stance and firm attitude of our Military Control Commission in upholding national sovereignty, the former consuls of each country obeyed the orders of our Military Control Commission and handed over all of the former French, German and American barracks to the personnel dispatched by the Military Control Commission for acceptance on the 14th and 16th, respectively. The land received this time includes 33.8 mu of the former U.S. barracks at No. 22 Dongjiaominxiang, 33.64 mu of the former French barracks at No. 1, Taijichang Third Alley, Dongjiaominxiang, and 26 mu of the former German barracks at No. 42 Dongjiaominxiang.

　　It is to be noted that after the Eight-Power Allied Forces invaded Beijing in 1900, the imperialist countries successively occupied land and built barracks in Beijing based on the unequal Treaty of XinChou. Although the United States, Britain, France, and other countries declared the abolition of privileges in China in 1943, the barracks of imperialist encroachment on Chinese sovereignty still existed under the rule of the traitorous Kuomintang reactionaries. Only the People's Republic of China can truly realize the task of abolishing imperialist privileges in China. This resolute patriotic action of the Beijing Military Control Commission in recovering the land of the U.S., French, and Dutch barracks, and requisitioning the barracks of the above-mentioned countries, has won the warm support of the people.

    京市军管会维护国家主权
    收回外国兵营地产
    并征用各该地面上兵营及其他建筑
    【新华社北京十八日电】中国人民解放军北京市军事管制委员会已收回了市内前美、法、荷兵营地产，并因军事需要征用各该地面上的兵营和其他建筑。
    军管会早在一月六日即为此而颁发布告，内称：“一、某些外国，过去利用不平等条约中所谓‘驻兵权’，在北京市内占据地面，建筑兵营。现在此项地产权，因不平等条约之取消，自应收回。二，此项地产上所建之兵营及其他建筑，因地产权收回所发生之房产问题，我政府另定办法解决之。三、目前此项兵营及其他建筑，因军事上之需要，先予征用。四、此项征用，自布告之日起，七日后实施。”七日，军管会向前美、法、荷（占用前德国兵营）领事发出命令，着其即指派专人负责，按期腾交前美、法、荷兵营，不得延误。
    美、法、荷前领事接到命令后，曾借口与国民党反动派所订之不平等条约，曾企图拖延抗拒。但因我军管会维护国家主权之立场严正，态度坚决，各该国前领事乃服从我军管会命令，分别于十四日和十六日将前法、德兵营和美国兵营全部腾交军管会所派人员接收。此次所接收之地产，计东交民巷二十二号前美国兵营三十三亩八分，东交民巷台基厂三条一号前法国兵营三十三亩六分四厘，东交民巷四十二号前德国兵营二十六亩。
    按自一九○○年八国联军侵入北京后，各帝国主义国家即根据不平等的辛丑条约，在北京先后占地建造兵营。一九四三年美、英、法等国虽声明废除在华特权，但在卖国的国民党反动派统治下，帝国主义侵犯中国主权的兵营却仍然存在。只有中华人民共和国才能够真正实现废除帝国主义在华特权的任务。此次北京市军管会收回美法荷三国兵营地产，并征用上列各国兵营的坚决爱国行动，获得了人民的热烈拥护。
