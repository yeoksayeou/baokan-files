I hope that friends in industrial and commercial circles will honorably purchase victory bonds.

    At the fourth meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, Chairman Mao told everyone: "Our situation can be summarized as: there are difficulties, there are solutions, and there is hope." Looking at the country's finances now, it is indeed undeniable that we are facing many difficulties, but we must recognize that these difficulties are brought about by victory, and that these difficulties can be overcome.
    Due to the development of the victorious situation, all financial expenditures will increase accordingly, while financial income cannot be increased quickly for the time being. Due to the development of the victorious situation, the huge Kuomintang army and public educators will have to be included by us; at the same time, in the areas we have liberated, the government must also invest a certain amount of capital in production and construction; and more importantly, it is necessary to continue to vigorously support the People's Liberation War in order to achieve our complete victory nationwide. Due to this situation, a large amount of national financial expenditure has been created, but financial income cannot be increased quickly according to the required amount, which inevitably forms a deficit in the national financial budget and increases financial difficulties. Now we only look at the agricultural production situation, this is a factual situation, and it is also an inevitable phenomenon in victory: in the current stage, China's rural economy accounts for the most important part of the entire national economy. After more than ten years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, the vast rural areas have suffered severe damage, resulting in a general decrease in the production level in vast areas by about a quarter compared with before the war. We know that the restoration and development of agricultural production cannot be achieved immediately, it must gradually move towards development and improvement from step-by-step restoration. This is just as Chairman Mao saw it: China's industry and agriculture can be restored within three to five years, and China's industry and agriculture can be greatly developed after eight to ten years. By that time, the financial difficulties will definitely be resolved, but in the current transitional stage, how will the financial deficit be made up? Undoubtedly, the People's Government's policy will never adopt the Kuomintang's method of selling national sovereignty to obtain foreign aid, and we must find a way out through self-reliance. Increasing revenue and reducing expenditure is our main method, but this still cannot balance financial revenue and expenditure, so we can only issue banknotes or bonds. However, the large-scale issuance of banknotes will inevitably lead to inflation and rising prices. This will not only affect the lives of the entire people, but also various construction and economic undertakings will suffer serious obstacles. This huge loss will be impossible to estimate. Therefore, the People's Government, with a completely responsible attitude towards the people, decided to issue people's victory real value bonds in 1950. This is precisely a wise decision to overcome temporary financial difficulties, strive for overall victory, and develop production. Because it is a real value bond, purchasers will not be affected by price fluctuations, which not only solves the current financial difficulties, but also takes care of the interests of purchasers. This is essentially different from the bonds issued by the Kuomintang. They used coercive and deceptive means to plunder the people's wealth and use it for anti-people undertakings. This cannot be compared with our people's victory real value bonds.
    Our victory real value bonds are taken from the people and used for the people. The policies of the People's Government and the victorious situation can be fully guaranteed. It can be seen from the recent newspapers that the broad masses of the people unanimously support and rush to pre-purchase; and the first issue of bonds in 1950 is 100 million shares, which is equivalent to about 2 billion catties of millet, which is about the amount of the government's investment in water conservancy and agriculture this year. The percentage of funds used by the government in various other production and construction undertakings this year is even higher than this. It can be seen that the government issues bonds to make up for the shortfall in income because it does things for the people. This money is used for construction undertakings, and the restoration and development of agriculture and industry in the future is foreseeable. It is not difficult to stabilize the government's finances, and repayment of principal and interest is absolutely guaranteed. Finally, I hope that friends in industrial and commercial circles will do their best to honorably purchase a large amount of people's victory real value bonds, help the government overcome the current temporary financial difficulties, strive for victory nationwide, and fight to the end for the new democratic construction of our new China.

    希望工商界朋友们光荣认购胜利公债
    李书城
    在中央人民政府委员会第四次会议上，毛主席曾告诉大家说：“我们的情况概括的说来就是：有困难的，有办法的，有希望的”。从现在国家的财政上来看，的确不可讳言的是面临着很多困难，但是我们要认识到这种困难是胜利给我们带来的，而且这种困难是有办法克服的。
    由于胜利形势的发展，一切财政上的开支都要随之增大，而财政上的收入，却一时不能增加的很快。因胜利形势的发展，庞大的国民党军队和公教人员，都将要为我们包容起来；同时在我们已经解放的地区，政府又要以一定的资本投入于生产建设方面；而更重要的是必需继续大力支援人民解放战争，以取得我们在全国范围内的彻底的胜利。由于这种情况，就造成了国家财政上的大量支出，但财政上的收入却不能按照需要的数目而很快的增加，这就必然的形成了国家财政预算上的赤字，增加了财政上的困难。现在我们只从农业生产情况的角度上来看，这是一种事实的情形，同时也是在胜利中一种不可避免的现象：在现阶段我国的农村经济，是占整个国民经济的最主要的一部分。经过了十余年的卫国战争和解放战争，广大的农村都遭受了严重的破坏，致使广大地区的生产水平一般的较战前降低了四分之一左右。我们知道农业生产的恢复和发展不会是立即就能实现的，必须是从一步一步的恢复渐渐的走向发展和提高的。这正如毛主席所见的：在三年五年以内才可以把中国的工业和农业恢复起来，而在八年十年以后中国的工业和农业才能得到巨大的发展。而到那时财政上的困难就一定解决了，但在目前过渡阶段，财政上的赤字又将如何弥补呢？无疑的，人民政府政策，决不会采用国民党那样的出卖国家主权以取得外援的办法，我们要从自力更生中寻找出路。开源节流是我们主要的办法，但是这还不能使财政收支达到平衡，所以只有发行钞票或公债了。但大量发行钞票，就必然要引起通货膨胀，物价上涨的结果。这样不只是影响了整个人民的生活，就是各种建设事业、经济事业也将遭受到严重的障碍。这种巨大的损失，将是不可能估计的。所以人民政府以完全对人民负责的态度，决议在一九五○年发行人民胜利折实公债。这正是一个克服暂时财政困难，争取全面胜利和发展生产的英明决策。因为是折实公债，就不会使购买人受到物价波动的影响，这样既解决了目前财政上的困难，又照顾了购买人的利益，这与国民党所发行的公债有着本质上的不同。他们是以强迫欺骗的手段掠夺人民的财富，用来进行反人民事业。这与我们发行的人民胜利折实公债是不能相提并论的。
    我们的胜利折实公债是取之于民用之于民的，人民政府的政策，和胜利的形势是完全可以保证的。从最近的报纸上便可以看到，广大的人民，都一致拥护，并且争先预购；而一九五○年第一期发行债额是一万万分，折成小米约二十亿斤左右，约等于今年政府在水利及农业方面的投资数目。政府今年在其他各种生产建设事业上所支用的款额其百分比较此更多。可见政府因为替人民做事而发行公债以补收入之不足，此款既用于建设事业，将来农工业的恢复与发展是可预期的。政府的财政不难稳定，还本付息是绝对有把握的。最后，希望工商界的朋友们拿出一切的力量来，光荣的大量认购人民胜利折实公债，帮助政府克服目前暂时的财政上的困难，争取全国范围的胜利，为我们新中国的新民主主义的建设奋斗到底。
