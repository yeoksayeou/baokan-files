Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: The Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government held its first administrative conference from November 21st to December 14th last year. The conference was presided over by Director Yuan Muzhi, and attended by the heads of the Bureau's Art and Production Committees, the Bureau's Office, and various departments and film studios. The conference discussed and decided on the 1950 film production, distribution, and enterprise-oriented implementation plans.

The conference pointed out that the current difficulties of the people's film industry are: the state-owned film output is far from meeting the needs of the film market and the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and cadres; and the state-owned film industry's funding cannot be self-sufficient, and the expenses are very large. Therefore, the guiding principles for film work in the future should be: to improve the output and quality of state-owned films, to assist private film industries in producing progressive films, to translate Soviet films and introduce progressive films from other countries, so that progressive films gradually gain an advantage in the film market. In the operation of the state-owned film industry, it should be enterprise-oriented, gradually achieving self-sufficiency in funding and reducing state expenditure.

	Intends to Produce 84 Films and 84 Issues
Based on the above principles and the manpower and material resources of the Bureau's Northeast, Beijing, and Shanghai film studios, the planned total number of films produced in 1950 is as follows: 26 feature films, 17 newsreels, 1 animated film (cartoons and puppet films), 40 translated Soviet films (feature films or documentaries); in addition, 48 news briefings will be produced, and 36 Soviet educational short films will be translated; for a total of 84 films and 84 issues.

The conference also discussed how to improve the quality of films. The conference believes that: on the one hand, the artistic level of the young people's film industry cannot be demanded too high; on the other hand, film artists must strive to improve on the existing basis so that films can play a greater role in publicity and education.

	Establish a Distribution Network and Develop Projection Teams to Penetrate Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
Regarding film distribution, the conference decided to gradually establish a national distribution network, in addition to strengthening cinema management, it is also necessary to develop projection teams. The target audience of the projection teams should be mainly workers, peasants, and soldiers. In addition to the existing three film management companies in Northeast, North China, and East China, it was decided to set up three more film management companies in Central South, Southwest, and Northwest China. The management companies will set up offices, distribution stations, liaison officers, or resident representatives according to the business conditions and number of cinemas in the areas under their jurisdiction. Public cinemas in various places should be under the unified management of the film management companies in major administrative regions. Each management company should improve distribution methods and strengthen film publicity. In order to expand the projection work in the troops, factories, and rural areas, it is planned to establish 700 projection teams in 1950 (260 teams sent to the troops, 440 teams sent to factories, organs, groups, and rural areas). In addition to state investment in the purchase of projection equipment, it is also planned to organize public-private joint venture enterprises, welcoming private investment in the projection business.

The conference decided to implement the enterprise-oriented operation of the film production business, that is, to strictly implement the economic accounting system and try to reduce costs as much as possible; a precise budget should be prepared before each film is produced; and a production bonus system should be implemented to encourage production. The management companies should base their expenditure on income from distribution, striving for complete self-sufficiency. State-owned cinemas and projection teams should strive for a certain surplus in addition to complete self-sufficiency.

	Zhou Yang Speaks
During the conference, Deputy Minister of Culture Zhou Yang attended and spoke. He pointed out that the new Chinese film industry has developed under Chairman Mao's literary and art policy, on the basis of newsreels in the old liberated areas, and by accepting the fine traditions of progressive films. It is necessary to resolutely continue to implement the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and reflect the themes of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the people's revolutionary struggle, and the construction of new China in many ways. It is necessary to improve the ideological and artistic nature of feature films, so that they can be improved from documentaries to the level of artistic films. In terms of production, in addition to large-scale feature films, some more popular and educational short feature films should also be produced to meet the different needs of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In film distribution, the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers should also be implemented, and projection teams should be developed in large numbers in the troops, factories, and rural areas in a planned and step-by-step manner. State-owned film industries should cooperate well with private film industries, unite, and strive together to build the new Chinese film industry.

    文化部电影局首届行政会议
    决定今年影片生产计划
    坚定地继续贯彻工农兵方向
    【新华社北京十六日电】中央人民政府文化部电影局，在去年十一月二十一日到十二月十四日召开了首届行政会议，由袁牧之局长主持，出席者有该局艺术和制作两委员会、局办公室及各处、各制片厂的负责人。会议讨论并决定了一九五○年度影片生产、发行、实行企业化等项计划。
    会议指出人民电影事业目前的困难是：国营电影出品还远不能满足电影市场和广大工农兵群众和干部的需要；而国营电影事业经费还不能自给，开支很大。因此，今后电影工作方针应当是：提高国营片的产量和质量，协助私营电影业制作进步电影，翻译苏联影片并介绍其他国家进步影片，使进步电影在电影市场上逐渐取得优势。在国营电影业的经营上，应实行企业化，逐步做到经费自给，减少国家开支。
            拟制各种影片八十四部又八十四号
    根据上述方针和该局所属东北、北京、上海三制片厂的人力物力等条件，计划一九五○年度的制片总数如下：故事片二十六部，新闻纪录片十七部，美术片（卡通和木偶片）一部，翻译苏联影片（故事片或记录片）四十部；另外摄制新闻简报四十八号，翻译苏联教育短片三十六号；共计八十四部又八十四号。
    会议并讨论了如何提高影片质量问题。会议认为：一方面对年青的人民电影的艺术水平，不能要求过高；另一方面电影艺术工作者则必须努力在现有基础上提高一步，使电影发挥更大的宣传教育作用。
            建立发行网发展放映队深入工农兵
    对于影片发行工作，会议决定逐步建立全国发行网，除加强影院经营外，更要发展放映队。放映队的工作对象，应以工农兵为主。除原有东北、华北、华东三个影片经理公司外，决定再增设中南、西南、西北三个影片经理公司。经理公司根据管辖地区的业务情况和影院数目，分别设置办事处、发行站、联络员或派驻代表等。各地公营影院应归各大行政区影片经理公司统一管理。各经理公司应改进发行方法，并加强影片宣传工作。为了扩大在部队、工厂、农村中的放映工作，计划在一九五○年内成立七百个放映队（派到部队去的二百六十个队，派到工厂、机关、团体和各地农村的四百四十个队）。放映队除由国家投资购买放映器材外，并拟组织公私合营的企业机构，欢迎私人投资放映事业。
    会议决定实行制片事业的企业化，即厉行经济核算制，尽量做到减低成本；每片摄制前，应有精密预算；并实行生产奖金制，以鼓励生产。经理公司则应当根据发行收入，量入为出，做到全部自给。国营影院和放映队，除全部自给外，应争取一定赢余。
            周扬讲话
    会议中，文化部周扬副部长曾出席讲话。他指出新中国的电影是在毛主席文艺方针下，在老解放区的新闻记录片的基础上，接受进步电影的优良传统而发展起来的。必须坚定地继续贯彻工农兵方向，多方面地反映中国人民解放战争和人民革命斗争以及新中国建设的主题，要提高故事片的思想性和艺术性，使之从纪录片提高到艺术片的水平。在制作上，除要求大型故事片外，还应摄制一些较通俗的而又有教育意义的小故事片，以适应广大工农兵群众的不同需要。在电影发行工作上，也应当贯彻工农兵方向，有计划有步骤地在部队、工厂、农村中大量发展放映队。对于私营电影业，国营电影业应与之很好合作，团结起来，为建设新中国电影事业而共同奋斗。
