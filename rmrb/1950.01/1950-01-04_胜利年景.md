The joyful festival enters our era, hope grows in our lives, comrades, let us sing in the glory of victory.

In every factory, mine, every institution, school, every liberated village in our motherland, and every glorious fighting company, they are all singing, day and night, the joyful songs of liberation and construction, connecting the wide wilderness into one piece. There have never been such joyful days.

For a long, long time, we have been waiting for such a year, the old people have waited until their hair turned white, suffered enough sins, but still waiting, believing that reaction cannot last long, just waiting for the day when a group of the most outstanding sons and daughters rise up, fighting for breath, just waiting for the day when their motherland stands up. Dear compatriots, this day has come. When people were most anxious, when darkness and terror long shrouded the motherland, when the flames of reaction branded the bodies of our beloved compatriots, a group of the most outstanding people rose from our ranks of sufferers, fighting and struggling with the reactionaries on the front line of the people, protecting the suffering people with their precious lives. In those most anxious times, in the remote snow-capped mountains and grasslands, and remote border fortresses, braving the threat of hunger, cold, and death, our troops were advancing arduously, for the people's eagerly awaited liberation, fighting steadfastly step by step. Our troops traveled every inch of the motherland, closely connecting with the suffering people. When the reactionaries cruelly deprived all freedom and strictly blockaded all news, we knew that dawn was coming, victory was near, the Communist Party was coming...

The expectation was not in vain, this day has finally arrived. When you are working actively and tirelessly for the people and the motherland under the banner of the Communist Party, comrade, this victory has the most real meaning, this victory belongs to us.

The wave of celebration is rolled into an unprecedented storm, twisting our Yangko dance, beating our waist drums, everyone sings their own song...

You go and open the map of the motherland, to see that beautiful and vast territory, you can see from every small black dot, every riverbank how countless people are rejoicing, in every town, every hill, are flying our beautiful red flag, the turbulent currents of the Taiwan Strait, anxiously waiting for our invincible iron army to cross over!

You go and check the railways, highways, and rivers that are like the veins of our motherland, the ones that have been cut off, congested, and paralyzed have been revived. From Guangzhou in the southernmost part to Manchuria, from the East China Sea to Baoji, from every town to the countryside, our trains, cars, and ships are speeding day and night, with red five-star flags, the flags of Mao Zedong, flying on top.

You go and read our newspapers, pictorials, and magazines, see how the People's Liberation Army is received by the people with heartfelt and eager welcome when liberating every town, see how the workers in the factories and mines after liberation have launched production competitions and merit campaigns, see how the peasants after land reform are working hard to produce and get rich...

Look, when our People's Republic of China was founded by the great leader—Chairman Mao, with a voice that shook the world, the international peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union had such a powerful and unshakable momentum, how the imperialists and their lackeys were trembling in fear...

You so excitedly welcomed the arrival of the Soviet Cultural and Scientific Delegation, welcomed Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, welcomed Asian and Australian women representatives, and you were also so excited to bid farewell to our representatives attending the World Congress of Defenders of Peace, the democratic youth representatives, driver Li Yong, and our literary writers.

You so excitedly listened to the news of Chairman Mao's arrival in Moscow, carefully watching how Chairman Mao was invited to the podium by Shvernik in the Kremlin, when Marshal Stalin appeared in the hall and a storm of cheers broke out.

……………………

This is "half of the twentieth century," the glory of victory is strongly shining ahead, the unceasing song is sounding in the light, comrade, let us strive forward.

    胜利年景
    王文琳
    欢腾的节日走进我们的时代，希望在我们的生命里滋长，同志，让我们歌唱，在胜利的光辉里。
    在我们祖国的每一个工厂、矿山，每一个机关、学校，每一个解放了的乡村，以及每一个光荣的战斗连队，都在歌唱着，日日夜夜，解放和建设的欢乐的歌声，把宽广的旷野连成一片，从来没有像这样纵情的日子。
    很久很久以前，就在等待着这样的年景呵，年老的人们等白了头发，受够了罪孽呵，但是还在等着，相信着反动不能长久下去，只等着有一天，有一群最优秀的儿女起来，争出一口气，只等着有一天，自己的祖国站立起来。亲爱的同胞们，这日子来了呵，当人们最焦急的时候，当黑暗恐怖，长久的在祖国笼罩的时候，当反动的凶焰从可爱的同胞们的身上烙过，一群最优秀的人们，就在我们受难者的行列中起来了，在人民的最前线和反动派战斗，搏斗着，以他们可贵的生命卫护了受难的人们。就在那些最焦急的时候，在荒僻的雪山草地，和遥远的边塞，冒过饥寒和死亡的威胁，我们的队伍正在艰苦的疾行，为了人们的迫不及待的解放，正在一步一步坚强的战斗。我们的队伍走遍了祖国的每一寸土地，紧密的联系着受难的人们，当反动派残酷的剥夺了一切自由，严密的封锁了一切消息的时候，我们便知道天快亮了，胜利快要到了，共产党快要来了……。
    没有白白的期待，这日子终于来了呵。当你在共产党的旗帜下，积极不懈地为人民、为祖国而工作的时候，同志，这胜利就有了最真实的意义，这胜利是属于我们的了。
    庆贺的热潮，卷进在空前的暴风雨里，扭起我们的秧歌，打起我们的腰鼓，大家唱起自己的歌……。
    你去打开祖国的版图，去看那美丽广大的幅员，你从每一个小黑点，每一条河畔都可以透视到无数的人们正在怎样的欢腾，在每一个城镇，每一个山岗，都飘扬着我们美丽的红旗，那台湾海峡的激流，焦急的等待着我们无敌的铁军渡过去！
    你去查看那好像我们祖国脉络一样的铁路，公路和河流，被切断过的，拥塞过的瘫痪过的都复活了，打从最南边的广州直到满洲里，打从东海到宝鸡，从每一个城镇到乡村，我们的火车，汽车，和船舶都在不分昼夜的疾驶，上边插着红色的五星旗帜，毛泽东的旗帜。
    你去翻阅我们的报纸、画报和杂志，看人民解放军解放每一个城镇的时候，受到人民怎样衷心殷切的接待，看解放后的工厂、矿山的工人们怎样展开了生产竞赛立功运动，看土地改革后的农民怎样劳动生产发家……。
    看，当我们中华人民共和国在伟大的领袖——毛主席，用震动全球的声音，宣告成立的时候，以苏联为首的国际和平民主阵营有了怎样强大不可摇撼的声势，帝国主义及其走卒们在怎样发抖骇怕………。
    你那么兴奋的去迎接苏联文化科学代表团的光临，迎接世界工联执行局总书记路易·赛扬，迎接亚澳妇女代表，你也那末兴奋的去欢送我们出席世界拥护和平斗争大会的代表，民主青年代表，司机长李永，以及我们的文学作家。
    你那么兴奋的倾听着毛主席到达莫斯科的消息，仔细的看着在克里姆林宫，当斯大林大元帅出现在大厅里而展开了暴风雨般的欢呼声时，毛主席怎样被什维尔尼克邀上了主席台。
    ……………………
    这是“二十世纪的一半”，胜利的光辉在强烈的照耀着前方，不息的歌声在光芒里响着，同志，让我们努力向前进。
