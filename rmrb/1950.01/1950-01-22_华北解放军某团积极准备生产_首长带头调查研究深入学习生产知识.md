    A Certain Regiment of the North China People's Liberation Army Actively Prepares for Production
    Leaders Take the Lead in Investigation and Research and In-depth Study of Production Knowledge
    [This Newspaper's News] A certain regiment of a certain unit of the North China People's Liberation Army is now actively preparing for production in response to Chairman Mao's call to implement self-sufficiency in production. The original report of Yang Jingtang, Chief of Staff of the regiment, is published as follows:
    When Political Commissar Wang of the regiment returned from the military's production work conference, he convened a meeting of the Standing Committee of the regiment's Party Committee on the same day to convey and discuss this year's production issues, focusing on the current preparatory work. The next day, he conveyed the information at a meeting of cadres above the company level throughout the regiment and organized a production cooperative, with Political Commissar Wang and Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang serving as the director and deputy director, respectively. They have now begun various specific preparatory tasks. In their preparatory work, they pay close attention to learning from the masses and conducting in-depth investigation and research.
    1. Investigating wasteland: We have investigated many times before, but with little success. This time, we specifically organized a wasteland surveying team. Regiment Commander An and Political Commissar Wang personally participated, braving the cold wind to investigate wasteland. Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang led another team to the northern mountains to investigate forests in preparation for organizing firewood cutting to solve the problem of firewood for the entire regiment (Editor's note: Firewood production must not violate government instructions on tree planting and forest protection). We have now investigated 3,000 mu of wasteland (including three types: waterlogged land, sandy land, and alkaline land), and the land rights for some of it have been clarified and contracts signed. The method of investigation is to first contact the local government and ask them to send people to assist us, and to conduct on-the-spot inspections together, and conduct on-the-spot research (applying the method of looking at terrain before battles to the investigation of land) to solve the problems of arable land area, soil quality, water source, land rights, engineering, what to plant, and how to plant.
    2. Inviting teachers: Before and after the investigation, we visited some elderly people with agricultural knowledge and familiar with the local situation to provide guidance. There is a 60-year-old traditional Chinese medicine doctor named Su in Gangezhuang who has a detailed understanding of the wasteland here, has stepped and measured its area, and has studied planting methods. For example, he learned that the sand here is heavier than that of Luan County, differing by two taels in a small bowl's capacity (i.e., twelve taels here, ten taels in Luan County). It is said that this kind of sand is of good quality and is a "humus" type. He also said that a large number of chickens can be raised here. He has conducted experiments (and is still raising more than 30), breaking the saying that "too many chickens are difficult to manage," because the air is good here, and the water quality is good (sweet water within two arrow shots of the sea), which are favorable conditions for raising chickens.
    From the investigation, it was learned that different soil types require different planting methods. It is said that sandy soil is suitable for planting small peanuts, which can be harvested a month earlier than others; alkaline land should be planted with resistant crops such as corn, dry rice, and mustard, and when planting, two inches or more of sand must be laid on the surface of the soil; grassland must have its grass roots removed, according to experiments: ten people can dig one mu a day, and waterlogged land must be converted into grid fields to prevent flooding.
    From the investigation, it was also learned that attention should be paid to preventing wind when planting this kind of land. The method is to plant mulberry tree forests. Mulberry trees have strong resistance, mulberry branches can be used to weave baskets, and mulberry leaves can be picked before the frost and used to feed horses.
    We are planning to gather some experienced people to hold an investigation meeting to learn from them properly.
    3. Accumulating manure: In the entire regiment, we did not pay enough attention to accumulating manure in the past. A lot of manure was taken away by the people or eaten by dogs. According to statistics from December 26th, the entire regiment only accumulated 72,000 jin of manure in the past three months, and it was not pure manure. In order to fulfill the Corps' requirement of 30 jin of manure per person, it has now been decided to renovate all toilets, stables, and pigsties. All soldiers must go to the toilets of their units. The accumulated manure must be well preserved, and the toilets must be cleaned once a day.
    4. Organizing slaughterhouses: In the past, the regiment only established a flour mill and raised 50 pigs, but all the pigs slaughtered by the regiment were slaughtered by the people. In addition to providing meals and burning their own firewood, each pig had to be given two jin of rice as wages, and the pig hair and bristles were all thrown away for nothing. This was a great waste (a total of 142 self-raised pigs were slaughtered by the entire regiment from August 1st to December 20th). Therefore, the regiment is now slaughtering pigs as a unit, and the time of slaughter has been stipulated, which will increase a great deal of income.

    华北解放军某团积极准备生产
    首长带头调查研究深入学习生产知识
    【本报讯】华北解放军某部某团，为响应毛主席号召实行生产自给，现正积极准备生产。兹将该团参谋长杨景堂报导原文发表如下：
    当该团王政委由军开生产工作会回来，当天召开了团党委常委会，传达与讨论今年的生产问题，并着重研究了当前的准备工作。第二天又在全团连以上干部会作了传达，组织了生产合作社，以王政委张副团长分任正副主任。现已着手进行各种具体准备工作。他们在准备工作中，十分注意向群众学习，深入调查研究。
    一、调查荒地：我们以前曾调查过很多次，但收效不大，这次专门组织了荒地勘察组，安团长、王政委亲自参加，冒着寒风调查荒地。张副团长另带一组到北山调查山林预备组织砍柴，解决全团烧柴问题（编者按：砍柴生产不可违犯政府关于植树护林的指示）。现已调查到荒地三千亩（其中包括水地、沙地、碱地三种），一部分已明确了地权，订立了契约。调查的办法，首先与地方政府取到联系，让他们派人协助，和我们一起实地考察，并实地研究（把打仗以前看地形那套方法运用到调查土地上来），以解决耕地面积、土质、水源、地权、工程以及种什么，怎样种的问题。
    二、请老师：调查前后，我们访问了一些有农业知识和熟悉当地情况的老人来指导，甘各庄有一位六十岁的姓苏的中医，他对这里的荒地曾作过详细了解，步量过它的面积，研究过种植法。譬如他了解到这里的沙子比滦县的重，在一小碗的容量中就差二两（即此地十二两，滦县十两），据说这种沙子质量很好，是一种“腐脂”质的。他还告诉说，这里可以大量养鸡，他曾作过试验（现在还养着三十多只），打破了“鸡多不好管”的说法，因为这里空气好，水性好（距海边两箭地以内都是甜水），这是养鸡的有利条件。
    从调查中了解到：地质不同，种法各异。据说：沙地适合种小花生，比别的可早收一个月；碱地要种有抵抗性的庄稼，如玉米、旱稻子、芥菜等，而且在种植时，须在地表面垫二寸以上的沙子；草地要挖掉草根，据试验：十个人一天可挖一亩，水地须改成井田，不易被水淹。
    从调查中，还了解到种这种地须注意防风，办法是要植桑树林，桑树挡力大，桑条可编筐，桑叶在未下霜前，采下来可以喂马。
    我们正筹划集中一些有经验的人开调查会，好好的向他们学习一番。
    三、积肥：在全团范围来说，过去对积肥重视不够，许多粪被老百姓掏走或狗吃了，根据十二月二十六日统计，全团移此三个月，仅积肥七万二千斤，且不是纯肥。为完成兵团每人交三十斤肥的规定，现确定重整所有厕所、马棚、猪圈、凡军人必去本单位厕所，积到的肥料要很好保管，厕所规定每天打扫一次。
    四、组织杀坊：过去团里只建立了粉坊，养五十口猪，但全团杀猪，都是请老百姓杀，除了管饭和烧自己柴禾外，每个猪还得给二斤米工钱，猪毛猪鬃全白扔掉了，这是个很大的浪费（总计八月一日到十二月二十日全团共杀自养猪一四二口），为此现已以团为单位杀猪，并规定了杀的时间，这就增加了一笔很大的收入。
