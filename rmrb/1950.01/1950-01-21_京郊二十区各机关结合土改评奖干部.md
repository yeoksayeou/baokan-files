Suburban Beijing 20 Districts Combine Land Reform with Commendation of Cadres

[Beijing News] After the first phase of land reform, all organs in the twentieth district of suburban Beijing carried out a mass-based commendation movement in December of last year, combining land reform with the work of the organs. Forty-seven model workers have now been selected, each of whom has received prizes and honorary awards. The commendation work was initiated by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Twentieth District Committee in September of last year. On December 15th of last year, commendation committees were established with the CPC branches as the core in each organ, and evaluations were carried out in group meetings and meetings of all staff members. The evaluation criteria were "four comparisons," namely, comparing work, comparing style, comparing learning, and comparing labor. Before the commendation, ideological mobilization was carried out, and CPC branch member meetings and meetings of all staff members were held successively, and a movement to write self-reflection notes and to engage in heart-to-heart talks was launched. The gains of this commendation movement are: first, the commendation movement was actually a major inspection of ideology and work style; the good were commended and rewarded, and the bad were criticized and educated, pointing out a clear direction for people to learn; second, the unity of new and old cadres was strengthened. For example, new cadres did not speak at meetings of the Tax Bureau in the past, but this has greatly improved after this movement.

    京郊二十区各机关结合土改评奖干部
    【北京讯】京郊第二十区各机关在第一批土地改革结束后，于去年十二月中，结合土地改革和机关业务工作，进行了群众性的评功运动。现已评出四十七个工作模范者，每人都得到奖品和名誉奖。评功工作是去年九月间中共第二十区区委会提出的号召。去年十二月十五日，即以中共支部为核心，各机关成立了评功委员会，在小组会议及全体工作人员会议上进行评议。评议标准为“四比”，即比工作，比作风，比学习，比劳动。评功前曾进行思想动员，先后召开了中共支部党员会议和全体工作人员会议，并发动写反省笔记，开展谈心运动。这次评功运动的收获；第一是评功运动实际是作了一次思想、作风的大检查，好的受到表扬与奖励，坏的受到批评与教育，给人们指出明确的学习方向；第二是加强了新老干部的团结，如税务分局过去开会时新干部不发言，经过这次运动后已大有改进。
