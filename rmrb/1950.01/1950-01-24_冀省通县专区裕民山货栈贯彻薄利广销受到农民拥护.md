    Hebei Province, Tong County Special District, Beijing Yumin Mountain Products Store has been actively solving the problem of selling mountain products and medicinal materials, gaining support from farmers, by correctly implementing the policy of small profits and quick turnover since its establishment. Many mountainous areas in the special district produce mountain products and medicinal materials, especially peach kernels, apricot kernels, and peppercorns in large quantities. For example, mountain products account for half of the total annual income of farmers in Wanping County. Before the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, most mountain products were wasted or used for other purposes due to blocked sales channels.
    After the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, the sales channels became smooth, and new and old mountain products began to flow into Beijing. However, at that time, some private merchants took the opportunity to drive down prices and seek exorbitant profits. Because farmers were eager to sell their goods and buy back daily necessities, they sold at low prices and suffered great losses.
    In order to protect the interests of farmers and seek legitimate outlets for mountain products, the Tong County Special Office established the Yumin Mountain Products Store in Beijing in March of last year, specializing in purchasing mountain products and medicinal materials from farmers and selling various daily necessities on their behalf. The store's capital was jointly contributed by the Tong County Special Office (formerly the Pingxi Special Office) and the Beijing Branch of the former North China Trade Corporation. The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China also provided strong support. Therefore, even during large-scale purchases, there was no feeling of a lack of funds.
    In the past eight months, the Yumin Store has made great progress in its business. In addition to being able to absorb mountain products from the entire special district, mountain products from Yanqing, Yongning, Fengning, Sihai, Zhuoxian, Laishui, Huailai, Zhuolu and other counties have also been transported here. In total, more than one million jin of mountain products (mainly walnut kernels, apricot kernels, melon seeds, and peppercorns) and more than 14,000 jin of medicinal materials were purchased in eight months, with a total value of more than 580 million yuan in Renminbi; 944,000 jin were sold, supplying farmers with 9,600 bolts of native cloth, 12,500 chi of fine cloth, more than 10,000 bags of cement, 22,000 jin of salt, and 3,000 jin of alkali. It also used foreign yarn to exchange a batch of native cloth from Xianghe and Sanhe counties in the disaster area from the Tong County Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, which was sold to the mountainous areas in western and northern Beijing.
    The main reason why the store was able to achieve such results in just a few months is that it correctly implemented and executed the policy and methods of small profits and quick turnover in its operations. For example, the scales were very accurate, and the commission deducted was small. Furthermore, the store also sent cadres to rural areas in the mountains to understand the storage and production of mountain products. It also established information-sharing relationships with 14 county cooperatives, 51 district cooperatives, and key village cooperatives in the region, appropriately grasped the market prices, and took care of the appropriate profits of farmers. When market prices changed or were unsuitable, it immediately reported to the Tianjin Export Corporation for appropriate adjustments. Also, because the store's service was enthusiastic and thoughtful and its style was simple and practical, farmers were willing to do business with the store.

### 冀省通县专区裕民山货栈贯彻薄利广销受到农民拥护

    冀省通县专区裕民山货栈贯彻薄利广销受到农民拥护
    【本报讯】河北省通县专区北京裕民山货栈自成立以来，正确贯彻薄利广销方针，积极解决山货、药材推销问题，获得农民拥护。该专区不少山地出产山货药材，尤以桃仁、杏仁、花椒为大宗。如宛平县农民每年总收入，山货即占一半。京津解放前，由于销路闭塞，大部山货均被浪费或作别用。
    京津解放以后销路通畅，新旧山货即开始流进北京。但当时若干私商趁机压价，贪图暴利，农民因急于出货，买回日用品，故低价卖出，吃亏甚大。
    通县专署为保障农民利益，谋求山货正当出路，去年三月即在京成立裕民山货栈，专为收买农民山货药材及代卖各种生活日用必需品。货栈资金由通县专署（原平西专署）和前华北贸易公司北京分公司伙出。人民银行北京分行亦大力帮助。因而虽在大批收购时，资金亦无缺乏之感。
    八个月来，裕民货栈业务进展很大。除了能吸收全专区的山货以外，延庆、永宁、丰宁、四海、涿县、涞水、怀来、涿鹿等县的山货，也多运送到来。总计八个月共收买山货（主要是核桃仁、杏仁、瓜子、花椒）一百万余斤，药材一万四千余斤，总值人民币五亿八千多万元；卖出九十四万四千余斤，供给农民日用品土布九千六百余匹，细布一万二千五百余尺，洋灰万余包，盐二万二千余斤，碱三千余斤。并用洋纱从通县专区供销总社换来灾区香河、三河等县一批土布，卖到京西、京北山区。
    该货栈在短短几个月，能作出这样的成绩，主要系在经营中正确贯彻和执行了薄利广销的方针和办法。如秤头很准，扣佣也少。再者该栈还派干部到山区农村深入了解山货保存及出产情况。又和本区十四个县社，五十一个区社及重点村社建立了互通消息的关系，恰当地掌握行市，照顾农民的适当利润。行市改变或不适合时，即时就报告天津出口总公司，做适当调整。又因该栈服务热心周到，作风朴实，故农民愿与该栈做买卖。
