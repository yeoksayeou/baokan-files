    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 3rd – The London Worker's Daily published a message on New Year's Eve entitled "America's Attempt to Seize Chinese Base in the Last Five Minutes," stating: In an effort to prolong the Chinese war in the last five minutes, the US government has decided to rush munitions, reinforcements, military advisors, and civil affairs advisors to Taiwan. The message pointed out: It is understood that at least 250 tanks have been shipped in the past three months, and the 4,000 Japanese naval and air combat experts recruited by General MacArthur are reportedly on their way. Chiang Kai-shek already has a group of American military advisors in Taiwan in the form of a "US Military Advisory Group in China," and this new group of advisors will be granted greater powers. In order to pave the way for the American civil affairs advisors, Chiang Kai-shek has specifically handed over Taiwan's civil administration to Wu Guozhen, the former Kuomintang Mayor of Shanghai. Wu's appointment was welcomed by the New York Times, which declared that "Wu's 'democratic' ideas are thoroughly Western."

    The message continued: Since the State Department published its report on relations with China months ago, the United States has been discussing its Far East plan. The foremost advocate of a more aggressive policy is General MacArthur, and he is supported by Defense Secretary Johnson. Now MacArthur's policy has become official US policy. Truman has asked his advisors to draw up a new, "active," and therefore military, policy "to contain communism in Asia." The Worker's Daily message stated that the new Truman Doctrine also calls for strengthening the US fleet based in the Philippines, and the cruiser "Boxer" and two destroyers have already been dispatched there.

    The message pointed out: France has formally transferred power in Indochina to the former Emperor Bao Dai, a French puppet. The next step in the new Truman Doctrine will be to assign an American military and civil affairs mission to work with Bao Dai in an effort to defeat the Democratic Republic of Vietnam led by Ho Chi Minh, which has liberated about 80 percent of the country. Bao Dai will also obtain American military equipment. It is possible that this American mission will be led by William Bullitt, the former American ambassador to the Soviet Union and France, who visited Indochina, and it was on his recommendation that the Bao Dai regime made its appearance. The message continued: Bullitt has long been a supporter of MacArthur's policies. Following the current trip to Asia by Jessup, the US Ambassador-at-Large (who oversees the US State Department's Asian plan), there may be further developments in the new "active" policy towards Asia. Jessup's trip will take him to India, Japan, and Southeast Asia, and will conclude with a conference of all US representatives in Southeast Asia in Bangkok at the end of January or early February.

    美帝对台湾残匪的援救是最后五分钟绝望的努力
    蒋介石任命吴国桢为台湾省伪主席，是为美国派来的民政顾问铺平道路。
    【新华社布拉格三日电】伦敦工人日报于除夕日发表题为“美国在最后五分钟夺取中国基地的企图”的消息称：为了在最后五分钟努力使中国战争延长，美国政府已经决定赶快运送军火、援军、军事顾问和民政顾问赴台湾。该消息指出：据悉在过去三个月内，最少已运去二百五十辆坦克，而麦克阿瑟将军所招募的四千名日本海空军作战专家，据悉正在途中。蒋介石在台湾已有了具有“美国驻华军事顾问团”形态的一批美国军事顾问，这批新顾问将被授予更大的权力。蒋介石为了替美国的民政顾问铺平道路，特将台湾民政交给了前国民党上海市长吴国桢，吴的任命受到纽约时报的欢迎，该报宣称“吴氏的‘民主’思想是彻底西方的”。
    该消息继称：自国务院在数月前发表对华关系报告以来，美国一直在讨论它的远东计划。更具侵略性政策的首要倡导人是麦克阿瑟将军，并且得到国防部长詹逊的支持。现麦克阿瑟的政策已变成美国的官方政策。杜鲁门已要求他的顾问拟订一个新的、“积极的”、因而又是军事的政策，“以便在亚洲抑制共产主义”。工人日报消息称，新的杜鲁门主义也要求加强在菲律滨为基地的美国舰队，并且已经派出巡洋舰“拳师”号和两艘驱逐舰开往该地。
    该消息指出：法国已正式把印度支那的政权移交法国傀儡以前的皇帝保大，新杜鲁门主义中的次一步骤将是指派一个美国的军事与民政使团和保大一同工作，以求打败胡志明所领导的越南民主共和国，这个共和国已解放了全国约百分之八十。保大并将取得美国的军事装备。可能这一美国使团将由前美国驻苏、驻法大使威廉·布立特领导，他曾访问印度支那，并且就是由于他的建议，保大政权便粉墨登场了。该消息继续指出：布立特许久以来便是麦克阿瑟政策的一个支持者，继美国无任所大使耶塞普（他掌管美国国务院的亚洲计划）目前的亚洲之行以后，或许对亚洲的新的“积极”的政策将有进一步的发展。耶塞普此行要到印度、日本以及东南亚，最后将于一月末或二月初在曼谷召开美国驻东南亚全体代表的会议而结束其亚洲之行。
