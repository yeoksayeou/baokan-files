    Songhu Garrison Troops Respond to the Party's Call
    Actively Engage in Labor Production to Improve Life
    Aiming for Full Year Self-Sufficiency in Vegetables This Year
    [Our Newspaper Shanghai News] In order to respond to and implement the six major tasks, after the Party Committee of the Songhu Garrison Command of the East China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army issued a call for production and frugality at the end of August last year, it has improved the lives of the troops through its own labor. Most mess units have increased the meat ration from one jin (supply system) per person per month to three and a half jin, and some have reached four jin twelve liang. Many mess units can eat two dishes per meal, drink soy milk and fried dough sticks in the morning, and eat meat dumplings twice a week.
    Since the promotion of production and frugality, combined with education on unity and progress, the troops' morale for garrison duty, learning, and production has been very high. The weight of the soldiers has generally increased, which has played a great role in consolidating the troops.
    The reason for these achievements is, first of all, the correct leadership of the Party Committee of the Garrison Troops, which promptly helped solve the difficulties of lacking land and tools in urban production. Secondly, the commanders and fighters understood the significance of production and frugality and actively responded to the call of their superiors. Company, and even division and regiment leaders personally took the lead in reclaiming wasteland for production, which further boosted the soldiers' production enthusiasm. Thirdly, under the direct leadership of the Production Guidance Committee of the Garrison Command, divisions, regiments, and companies have established specialized production and frugality organizations to uniformly lead production. In terms of production methods, in addition to scattered land and general sideline production being managed separately by each mess unit, most of the work adopts a unified and centralized leadership for production and supply. For example, taking divisions and regiments as units, production teams are organized to unify agricultural production, establish tofu workshops to uniformly supply tofu and soy milk, and organize supply stations to uniformly forward rice, oil, salt, meat, beans, and daily necessities.
    However, in the past stage of the production movement, there were still some shortcomings: (1) At the beginning, ideological mobilization was not deep enough. Some units did not pay enough attention to production and frugality, emphasizing difficulties such as lack of time and land, which delayed the time for reclaiming wasteland for cultivation. (2) Individual units had departmentalism and lacked an overall concept. They were unwilling to accept centralized leadership, which affected the due achievements of production. (3) A few units lacked inspection, supervision, and specific guidance, which made the development of production unbalanced. In order to carry out this year's large-scale production and truly achieve the goal of complete self-sufficiency in vegetables, many divisions and regiments have summarized the production work in the past stage and put forward specific improvement measures.

    淞沪警备部队响应党的号召
    积极劳动生产改善生活
    今年要做到全年菜蔬自给
    【本报上海专讯】为响应执行六大任务，人民解放军华东军区淞沪警备司令部党委会于去年八月底提出生产节约的号召后，已用自己的劳动改善了部队的生活。大部分伙食单位已由每月每人一斤肉（供给制）提高到三斤半，有的达到了四斤十二两。许多伙食单位每顿饭都能吃上两个菜，清晨还喝豆浆和油条，每星期吃两顿肉饺子。
    自提倡生产节约后，把劳动生产与团结进步教育相结合，部队的警备、学习、生产情绪均很高涨，战士体重普遍增加，对于巩固部队起了很大的作用。
    这些成绩所以获得，首先是警备部队的党委领导的正确，及时帮助解决城市生产中缺乏土地和工具的困难。其次是指战员明了了生产节约意义，积极响应上级号召。连队乃至于师、团首长亲自带头开荒生产，使战士的生产情绪更为高涨。再次是在警备司令部的生产指导委员的直接领导下，师、团连队设有专门生产节约组织，统一领导生产。在生产方式上，除零散土地及一般副业生产由各伙食单位分散经营外，大部采统一集中领导生产与供应工作。如以师、团为单位，组织生产队统一农业生产，建立豆腐坊，统一供给豆腐豆浆，组织供应站统一转发米、油、盐、肉、豆及日用必需品等。
    但在过去一阶段生产运动中，仍存在一些缺点：（一）开始时思想动员不够深入，有的单位对于生产节约重视不够，强调无时间、无土地等困难，拖延了开荒种地的时间。（二）个别单位存在着本位主义思想，缺乏整体观念。不愿集中领导，结果影响了生产应有的成绩。（三）有少数单位缺乏检查督促及具体指导，使生产发展不平衡。为了开展今年大生产，确实做到蔬菜完全自给的目标，不少师团总结过去一阶段生产工作，并提出具体的改进办法。
                                                        （超祺）
