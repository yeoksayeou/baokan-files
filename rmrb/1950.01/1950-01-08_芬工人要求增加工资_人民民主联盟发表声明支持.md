Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, January 5th: Finnish workers are universally demanding wage increases. In the past few days alone, workers in the construction industry, food and textile industries, stonemasons, and logging and rafting workers have passed resolutions demanding increased salaries. The Finnish Trade Union Central Federation, manipulated by right-wing elements, has also proposed raising workers' salaries. The Finnish government is currently in discussions with employers, attempting to delay making any decisions.

The parliamentary group and executive committee of the Finnish People's Democratic League issued a statement, pointing out that right-wing Social Democrats have decided to turn the wage issue into capital for their election campaign and are trying to regain the prestige they have lost among the masses. The statement declared: If the Fagerholm government is willing to meet the legitimate demands of the workers, it can act in accordance with the Special Economic Powers Act without consulting the bourgeois elements in parliament. The bourgeoisie and the Social Democrats are attempting to elect the same presidential candidate, and they have only one goal: to deceive the working masses and voters. The parliamentary group and executive committee of the Finnish People's Democratic League demanded an immediate and general wage increase in the statement.

    芬工人要求增加工资
    人民民主联盟发表声明支持
    【新华社北京七日电】据塔斯社赫尔辛基五日讯：芬兰工人正普遍要求增加工资。仅在前几天之内，通过要求增加薪资决议的，已有建筑业工人，食品与纺织工业工人，石工，伐木与筏木业工人等。右翼分子操纵的芬兰工会中央联合会，亦提出提高工人薪资的建议。芬兰政府则正和雇主进行商谈，力图延缓作出任何决定。
    芬兰人民民主联盟议会党团与执行委员会发表声明，指出右翼社会民主党人决定把薪资问题变成他们的选举运动的资本，并试图挽回他们在群众中失去的威望。声明宣称：假若法吉荷尔姆政府愿意满足工人的合法要求，则它可以依据特别经济权力法办事，而用不着和议会的资产阶级人士商量。资产阶级和社会民主党正企图选举同一总统候选人，他们只有一个目标，就是欺骗工人群众和选民。芬兰人民民主联盟议会党团与执行委员会在声明中要求立刻地普遍增加工资。
