Cotton Procurement Mostly Completed in North China Cotton-Producing Areas
Large Quantities of Raw Cotton Continuously Shipped to Tianjin and Shanghai

[This newspaper report] Since the decision last autumn to collect a portion of cotton as tax-in-kind in various parts of North China, the North China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and other departments dispatched cadres in early December to closely cooperate with local governments and cooperatives in carrying out the collection work. At present, except for a few areas where cotton production is relatively low and only a portion of the task has been completed, most areas are close to completing their assigned quotas. In Yongzhi and Qinghe areas of Linqing Prefecture, one million catties have been collected, exceeding the original target. As of now, more than nine million catties of cotton have been collected from various regions. In the cotton collection work in Xinxiang Prefecture, a cotton collection committee was also organized, and various companies also drew more than a dozen technical cadres to cooperate with local governments and cooperatives in Anyang, Heze, Hexi, Xinxiang, Puyang and other prefectures, establishing cotton collection stations and cotton collection teams in various villages to carry out the collection. During this cotton collection, due to in-depth publicity in some areas, many farmers were able to automatically classify the cotton and separate the bad cotton, thereby improving the quality. However, in some individual areas, such as Linqing, the quality was affected due to excessive emphasis on quantity and poor classification. At present, the cotton collected from various places is being ginned, baled, and concentrated, ready for shipment.

[Another news item] In order to prevent the reduction of cotton transportation during the Spring Festival holiday from hindering production, the North China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has recently been systematically allocating raw cotton from various cotton-producing areas to Tianjin. According to statistics, from the 1st to the 9th of this month, within nine days, more than four million catties of raw cotton were transported from various places to Tianjin and handed over to the China Textile Company. The company has accumulated a large amount of cotton. Currently, various branch companies are still continuing to load and transport cotton to Tianjin.

Furthermore, in order to support the cotton textile industry in Shanghai, the company is continuously allocating a large batch of raw cotton for southward transportation. In just four days, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of this month, more than 1.6 million catties of raw cotton have been shipped from Shijiazhuang, Dexian, Xinxiang and other places. At present, various places are still continuing to allocate and transport cotton.

    华北各产棉区征棉大部完成
    大量原棉源源调运津沪
    【本报讯】华北各地自上年秋征决定折征一部棉花后，十二月初华北花纱布公司等部门即派出干部，密切配合各地政府、合作社进行征收工作。目前除个别地区因产棉较少仅完成部分任务外，大部地区已接近完成数字。临清专区的永至、清河两地，已征起一百万斤，超过了原订数字。截至目前为止，各地区征起的棉花已达九百余万斤。新乡专区在征棉工作中，并组织了征棉委员会，各公司并抽出技术干部十余人，分往安阳、菏泽、河西、新乡、濮阳等专区配合当地政府及合作社，普设征棉站，并在各村设立征棉小组，进行征收。此次征棉中有些地区由于宣传深入，使得许多农民都能自动分级，将坏花分出来，因而提高了质量。但也有个别地区，如临清因过分强调数量，分级较差，影响了质量。现各地征起的棉花，正进行轧籽、打包、集中，准备起运。
    【又讯】华北花纱布公司为预防春节假期棉花减运，妨害生产。日来特有计划地由各产棉区向津市调拨原棉。据统计本月一至九日九天内，由各地运往津市交与中纺公司的原棉即达四百余万斤。该公司积棉甚多。现各地分公司尚在继续装运来津。
    又该公司为支援上海棉纺业，正陆续调拨大批原棉南运。仅本月二、三、四、五四天内，即已由石家庄、德县、新乡等地启运原棉一百六十余万斤。目前各地仍在继续调运中。
