           Sixth Episode: Liberation

    One day, the fat father took her to people's homes,
    To play cards and sing as a guest.
    Her father said: "Guizhen, I made a good deal today,
    I can earn twelve gold bars."
    He wanted Guizhen to put a fingerprint on the paper,
    He bought two gold-plated ornaments to give to Guizhen,
    Guizhen was happy to hear that,
    And carelessly pressed her fingerprint.
    In an instant, the guests dispersed and left,
    Leaving Guizhen alone at the door.
    A man with a face full of fierce flesh came,
    Without speaking, he glared first,
    He said he paid to buy Guizhen,
    Twelve gold bars were spent.
    Guizhen said: "Don't talk nonsense,
    I'll tell my father, you won't survive!"
    The man laughed loudly when he heard this,
    And took out the deed of sale from his arms,
    It was written that Guizhen was sold to Zhang Wencai,
    For a total of twelve gold bars.
    It had her father's signature and surname,
    And also had Guizhen's fingerprint on it.
    Guizhen said: "You are trafficking in people, which is against the law,
    I will sue you in court, your crime is not light!"
    Zhang Wencai laughed when he heard this,
    And called out, Guizhen, listen to me:
    "The mayor is my cousin,
    The court is under my control,
    Police and military police call me Second Master,
    If I want you to die, you can't live,
    I have opened twenty brothels,
    And twenty-eight top-notch girls,
    If you obediently listen to Second Master,
    I'll send you to a top-notch brothel to earn money.
    If you dare to say half a no,
    Second Master, I will skin you alive and pull out your tendons!"
    Poor nineteen-year-old Guizhen,
    From then on, she fell into the brothel again.
    The next day, she entered the Hall of Joy,
    Renamed Dongmeihua to receive guests.
    On the third day, she was published in the yellow newspaper,
    With a big headline "Famous Maiden Falls into Prostitution,"
    Guizhen's picture was printed in the newspaper,
    The name Dongmeihua became famous.
    Bureaucratic politicians and libertines,
    These sons of turtles who suck people's blood to enrich themselves,
    The Hall of Joy was as bustling as a market,
    Busy all day and night without stopping.
    Time passed like flowing water,
    Before she knew it, another year of spring had passed.
    Receiving guests all day and night,
    Her body was getting weaker and weaker.
    Her cheeks were thin, her eye sockets were dark,
    Her back ached, her legs hurt, and she felt dizzy.
    One night, she caught a cold while sleeping,
    The next day, she had a fever and her whole body ached.
    Syphilis broke out, and sores grew on her lower body,
    She fell in the hospital and couldn't get up for two months.
    Before she was fully recovered,
    She returned to the Hall of Joy to receive guests.
    She was thin, weak, and haggard,
    Her beauty faded like spring.
    As the saying goes, no good person is willing to seek pleasure,
    How can there be good people who seek pleasure?!
    Guizhen's appearance and figure were not as good as before,
    Her old friends parted ways.
    Dongmeihua was put on the blacklist from then on,
    And had no guests all day and night.
    The madam, Zhang Wencai, turned his face,
    Beat her, scolded her, and twisted her with his hands.
    Suddenly, the cannons of liberation sounded,
    The Kuomintang army in Shijiazhuang surrendered to the People's Liberation Army.
    In less than two days, the People's Liberation Army entered the city,
    The people cheered for liberation and turned over.
    The brothels were also closed,
    And the girls were gathered to receive training.
    The madam still spread rumors,
    Scaring the girls and making them uneasy.
    Guizhen entered this women's school,
    And felt uneasy day and night.
    To know what will happen next?
    Listen to the next episode for details.

               Seventh Episode: Reunion

    It is said that Shijiazhuang was liberated,
    And the prostitutes were gathered to receive training.
    Guizhen had tasted the bitterness of the old society,
    And did not recognize the new society.
    The female staff members spoke to her,
    Guizhen didn't listen to a word.
    She had suffered enough for four or five years,
    She didn't believe there were good people in the world.
    She thought: "Who doesn't say nice things at first,
    In the end, they all throw you into the trap.
    This women's school provides food and accommodation,
    How can they spend money for nothing?
    I don't know what kind of bad 'tricks' they are up to,
    It certainly won't be a good thing."
    She planned to escape every day,
    And didn't like to listen to anything the staff members said.
    When others were listening to lectures in class,
    She daydreamed and couldn't listen;
    When others were learning to write at the table,
    She made noise and didn't feel at ease;
    When others sang, performed, and danced the Yangko,
    She sat aside without saying a word;
    When others carried water, swept the floor, and looked for work to do,
    She lay in bed moaning;
    When others wanted her to see a doctor,
    She said she was not sick and didn't need to worry about it.
    When schools and factories came to visit,
    She said: "Mind your own business."
    One day, the new Women's Weaving Factory came to visit,
    And brought People's currency, pencils, and notebooks.
    They called everyone to listen to the speech of the factory representative.
    Guizhen sat in the back and didn't like to listen.
    She looked around and calculated,
    How to escape from this school gate.
    She thought Jin Hua hadn't been seen for a long time,
    She was also captured and trained in Zhangjiakou.
    Jin Hua must be dead,
    Otherwise, she must have been conscripted and assigned to a disabled person.
    Just as she was thinking wildly,
    She suddenly heard everyone's applause.
    She suddenly raised her head and looked,
    She saw the person speaking on the stage.
    That person's face looked like Jin Hua,
    And her voice was also particularly friendly.
    If it was really Sister Jin Hua,
    Looking at her like that, she didn't dare to believe it.
    She wore a gray military cap on her head,
    Her hair was cut to the root of her ears,
    She wore a gray uniform,
    Clean and tidy,
    A yellow leather belt was tightly tied around her waist,
    Canvas exercise shoes were on her feet,
    Her face was red and plump,
    And she was particularly energetic when she spoke.
    If she wasn't Sister Jin Hua,
    Her appearance and voice were too similar.
    Guizhen was secretly estimating,
    A burst of applause startled her.
    During the applause, the meeting ended,
    The representatives were about to part ways with everyone.
    Guizhen couldn't help but ran up,
    And blurted out Jin Hua's name.
    The person heard and turned her head to look,
    And quickly answered, calling Guizhen.
    That person was indeed Sister Jin Hua,
    The two sisters were especially close after a long separation.
    They held hands and hugged,
    Calling each other sister and sister intimately.
    The people around them were confused when they saw it,
    Seeing the two sisters so happy.
    The two sisters came to the dormitory hand in hand,
    Each telling the story of their separation.
    Only then did she know that Jin Hua, since she was taken back that night,
    Had been trained in that women's class.
    Three months later, her thinking changed and she graduated,
    Becoming a new woman of the new society.
    Jin Hua had no relatives, no support,
    Staying in the school weaving factory as a worker.
    From then on, she turned over and was liberated,
    Becoming a glorious female worker.
    Guizhen said: "I thought you had been conscripted to Guanwai,
    And I thought you had been assigned to a disabled person."
    Jin Hua said: "These are all rumors made by the madam,
    There was no such thing at all.
    There were more than a hundred of us sisters being trained,
    None of them were assigned to be conscripted.
    Those with families went home to reunite,
    Those with partners married and became good people.
    Those without families or support were found jobs,
    To live independently by labor.
    Some went to the farm to farm the fields,
    Some went to the factory to be workers.
    I voluntarily stayed in the weaving factory,
    Working and eating on my own, feeling light all over.
    Since the liberation of Shijiazhuang City,
    The factory moved to Shijiazhuang City.
    In the factory, I found a worker partner myself,
    I got engaged to him on the fifteenth of last month.
    I advise you, sister, not to listen to rumors,
    Studying hard is the most important thing.
    Change your old thoughts,
    And distinguish between benefactors and enemies.
    The Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bureaucratic society,
    Harmed the poor people so much.
    The Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government,
    Liberated our sisters from the fire pit.
    Guizhen, sister, please rest assured,
    Early liberation is early glory."
    Guizhen nodded when she heard this,
    "I will keep my sister's words in my heart,
    I will definitely study hard,
    And be determined to learn to be a good person from now on."
    Jin Hua said: "I'll tell you a good news, sister,
    I guarantee you'll be happy to hear it.
    Since Brother Deqiang was arrested,
    He joined the People's Liberation Army in the war.
    He was wounded and came to the rear hospital.
    After his injuries healed, he was assigned to work in Shijiazhuang City.
    Now he is a squad leader in the Public Security Bureau,
    I guarantee you will see him tomorrow."
    Guizhen smiled when she heard this,
    Her face turned red to the root of her ears.
    She couldn't help but shed tears,
    And cried out on the bed.
    Scared, Jin Hua panicked,
    And kept calling Guizhen.
    "Quickly, don't cry anymore,
    Tell me what's on your mind."
    Guizhen called out in tears, "Sister Jinhua,
    What face do I have to see him?!"
    Jin Hua said: "Don't think like that,
    Brother Deqiang is a new thinker.
    I told him about our experiences,
    He only hates the Central Army.
    He often thinks of you to me,
    He treats me the same as before."
    Guizhen felt a little relieved after hearing these words.
    As they talked, it was getting dark,
    And the two sisters parted ways.
    The next day, Guizhen heard that someone from the headquarters was looking for her,
    She was both happy and surprised.
    Hesitantly, she came to the headquarters,
    A person was sitting on the chair.
    Wearing a yellow military uniform,
    With a dark red face, he looked energetic.
    As soon as that person saw Guizhen, he stood up quickly,
    It was Brother Deqiang, Guizhen recognized him clearly.
    Guizhen wanted to call Brother Deqiang shyly and smilingly,
    But for some reason, she couldn't utter a word.
    Her face was flushed and her hair stood on end,
    Tears streamed down her face.
    She lowered her head and played with her clothes,
    Not daring to look at him.
    For a long time, the two didn't speak,
    Deqiang spoke first,
    Calling out, "Guizhen, please sit down,
    Don't be sad, rest assured.
    I only hate the Kuomintang,
    The old society is like a trap.
    You and I were both born and raised by our parents,
    Everyone wants to be a good person in peace.
    It's hateful that the old society and the old system,
    The lives of the poor are not as good as livestock.
    Women suffer even more,
    Being trampled and insulted by others.
    Now the whole country is about to be liberated,
    The feudal and dark system will soon be eliminated.
    The days of turning over have arrived,
    We should all be very happy.
    I can forgive the past,
    This cannot be blamed on you alone.
    As long as you study hard from now on,
    And distinguish between enemies and benefactors,
    Study culture and study labor,
    Change your thoughts and change your mind.
    As long as you progress and don't dislike me,
    Deqiang is not an ungrateful person."
    Guizhen nodded and called, "Deqiang,
    I remember your words clearly.
    I understand that the Kuomintang harmed me,
    I understand that the Communist Party is the benefactor.
    From now on, I will study hard,
    Change my thinking and be a laborer.
    I hope you will often guide me,
    I will always remember you in my heart."
    Sure enough, Guizhen listened to the advice,
    And she worked and studied very seriously.
    Some sisters still didn't want to change,
    She often helped them too.
    She fought against the madam, Zhang Wencai,
    And fought against the bad guy Sun Deying.
    As the saying goes, nothing is difficult in the world,
    If only you have the determination.
    After studying for less than three months,
    She was proficient in everything.
    Her syphilis was also completely cured,
    And her body became plump and energetic.
    The staff members all said she was good,
    And introduced her to Jin Hua's factory to be a worker.
    The two sisters were very happy working together.
    Deqiang often came to see them too.
    Guizhen also met Jin Hua's fiancé,
    Who was an honest and good worker.
    In the blink of an eye, it was the end of the year,
    The New Year after liberation was especially happy.
    The workmates all came to congratulate them,
    The four people got married in two pairs.
    Thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao,
    The prostitute's daughter turned over completely.

                                                      (The End)

    烟花女儿翻身记
    献给妇女生产教养院的姐妹们

    （续第三十二期，一月十五日）
           第六回  解放
    有一天那胖子父亲带她走人户，
    去打牌唱歌当客人，
    她父亲说：“桂贞，我今天作了笔好买卖，
    能赚金条十二根。”
    要桂贞在纸上按个手印，
    他买两个金镏子送桂贞，
    桂贞听说心欢喜，
    马马虎虎就按了手印，
    霎时客散人走了，
    把桂贞一人留在房门，
    来了个满脸横肉的男子汉，
    没有说话就先瞪眼睛，
    他说他出钱把桂贞买了，
    金条花了十二根，
    桂贞说：“你不要胡说乱开口，
    我告诉我父亲你活不成！”
    那人听罢哈哈大笑，
    在怀中掏出了卖身的纸文凭，
    上写着把桂贞卖给了张文才，
    一共是金条十二根，
    有她的父亲签的名和姓，
    还按的有桂贞的手指印，
    桂贞说：“你买卖人口犯王法，
    我法院告你，你罪不轻！”
    张文才一听哈哈笑，
    叫了声桂贞你是听：
    “市长是我的亲表哥，
    法院是我的手下人，
    警察宪兵把我叫二爷，
    我要你死来你就活不成，
    我窑子开了二十个，
    光上等的姑娘就二十八人，
    你要是乖乖的听二爷的话，
    送你到上等的窑子把钱挣，
    你要是敢说半个不字，
    二爷我剥你的皮来抽你的筋！”
    可怜十九岁的桂贞女，
    从此又堕入了娼妓门。
    第二天进了欢乐堂，
    改名冬梅花接客人，
    第三天登上了黄色的新闻报，
    大吹“名家娟秀落妓门”，
    桂贞的像片报纸上印，
    冬梅花三字可出了名，
    官僚政客和浪荡子，
    吸人血自肥的这些龟子孙，
    欢乐堂人来客往如市场，
    整天整夜不消停，
    岁月光阴如流水，
    不觉又混了一年春。
    成天成夜接客人，
    身子越来越不行，
    两颊瘦削眼窝发黑，
    腰酸腿疼头发晕。
    有一夜睡觉着了凉，
    第二天发烧浑身疼，
    梅毒发，下身又长疮疥，
    倒在医院两月也起不了身，
    病还没有全好了，
    又回欢乐堂接客人，
    体瘦身虚人憔悴，
    花容凋谢不如春，
    常言说好人谁肯寻花问柳，
    寻花问柳的那有好人？！
    桂贞的面貌身姿不如旧，
    旧有的朋友两离分，
    冬梅花从此挂黑牌，
    成天成夜没有客人，
    领家张文才翻了脸，
    又打又骂又用手拧。
    突然解放的大炮响，
    石家庄蒋匪军投降了解放军，
    不两天解放军进入城内，
    人民欢呼解放大翻身，
    又把这妓院封闭了，
    集中姑娘们去受训，
    领家还是把谣言造，
    吓得姑娘们不安心。
    桂贞进了这妇女学校，
    日夜心里不安宁，
    要知道以后怎么样？
    且听下回说分明。
               第七回  团圆
    却说解放了石家庄，
    集中妓女们去受训，
    桂贞尝尽了旧社会的苦，
    把新的社会认不清，
    女工作人员给她来讲话，
    桂贞半句也没有听在心，
    她四五年的生活受够了，
    她不信世界上还有好人，
    她心想：“谁不是开头都说得好，
    末了儿都扔在那陷人坑，
    这妇女学校给吃又给住，
    那能白白的花钱银，
    不知又出的是些什坏‘花招’，
    一定不会有好事情。”
    天天盘算怎么样逃跑，
    任工作人员说什么她也不爱听，
    人家在上课听讲话，
    她胡思乱想听不进；
    人家在桌子上学写字，
    她吵吵闹闹不安心；
    人家唱歌演戏扭秧歌，
    她坐在一边不吭声；
    人家抬水扫地找活作，
    她躺在床上直哼哼；
    人家要她去治病，
    她说她没病不用操心，
    学校工厂来慰问，
    她说：“咸吃萝卜淡操心”。
    有一天新妇女织布厂来慰问，
    送来了人民券、铅笔和笔记本，
    召集大家听布厂代表讲话。
    桂贞坐在后面她不爱听。
    她到处张望心里盘算，
    怎样才能逃出这学校门，
    心想金花好久不见了，
    她也是在张家口捉去受训的人，
    金花一定是死定了，
    要不一定充军配了残废人。
    正在胡思与乱想，
    忽听见大家的鼓掌声，
    她猛然抬头用目看，
    看见了台上讲话的人，
    那人的面貌像金花，
    说话的声音也分外相亲，
    要说真是金花姐，
    你看她那样儿又不敢信，
    她头上戴了顶灰军帽，
    头发剪到了耳朵根，
    穿了一身灰制服，
    又干净来又齐整，
    一条黄皮带腰中紧束，
    帆布的操鞋脚下蹬，
    脸上又红有发胖，
    说话特别的有精神，
    要说她不是金花姐，
    像貌声音太相近，
    桂贞她正在暗暗估量，
    一阵掌声使她吃了一惊，
    鼓掌之间散了会，
    代表们要和大家两离分，
    桂贞不由自主的跑了上去，
    把金花的名字冒叫了一声，
    那人听见扭回头看，
    连忙答应叫桂贞，
    那人果真是金花姐，
    姐妹俩久别重逢分外亲，
    又是拉手又是拥抱，
    姐姐妹妹叫了个亲，
    旁边的人看见都莫明其妙，
    看她姐妹二人好欢欣。
    姐妹俩手拉手来到了寝室里，
    各人诉诉离别的情，
    才知道金花自从那夜抓回去后，
    就在那妇女班里受了训，
    三个月后思想转变毕了业，
    作了新社会的新女人，
    金花无亲无戚无依靠，
    留在学校织布场里当工人，
    从此翻身得解放，
    变成了光荣的女工人。
    桂贞说：“我只当你充军到了关外，
    又只当你发配给了残废人，”
    金花说：“这都是领家胡造谣，
    根本没有那回事情，
    我们受训的姐妹一百多，
    没有半个发配去充军，
    有家的回家团圆聚，
    有对象的从良作好人，
    没家没依靠的给找职业，
    独立劳动学生存，
    有的去农场务庄田，
    有的去工厂当工人，
    我自愿留在了织布厂，
    自作自吃一身轻，
    自从这石家庄城解放后，
    布厂才搬到这石家庄城，
    在工厂我自个儿寻了个工人对象，
    上月十五我和他订了婚，
    劝妹妹你可不要听信谣言，
    好好学习最要紧，
    好好转变旧思想，
    把恩人仇人要分清，
    国民党蒋介石官僚社会，
    害得穷人真伤心，
    共产党毛主席人民政府，
    解放咱姊妹出火坑，
    桂贞妹妹你快安心，
    早早解放早光荣。”
    桂贞听罢把头点，
    “姐姐的话儿我记在心，
    我一定安心来学习，
    从今立志学好人。”
    金花说：“我告诉妹妹个好消息，
    包你听了心高兴，
    自从德强哥哥被抓了去，
    打仗他就投了解放军，
    挂彩来到了后方医院，
    伤好后分配工作在石家庄城，
    现在他在公安局里当班长，
    我包你明天就见人。”
    桂贞听罢面带笑，
    脸面红到了耳朵根，
    禁不住颗颗泪珠往下掉，
    倒在床上哭出了声，
    吓得金花发了慌，
    口口声声叫桂贞，
    “快快不要再哭了，
    有心事说给姐姐听。”
    桂贞含泪叫了声：“金花姐，
    我有何脸面去见人？！”
    金花说：“你快不要这样想，
    德强哥哥可是个新脑筋，
    我把我们的遭遇讲给了听，
    他恨只恨的那中央军，
    他常常还向我惦念到你，
    他待我也还是一样亲。”
    桂贞听了这一席话，
    她这里才稍稍安了心，
    说着说着天快黑，
    她姐妹二人才离分。
    第二天桂贞听说指挥部有人找，
    她又是高兴又是惊，
    迟迟疑疑来到了指挥部，
    椅子上坐了一个人，
    穿着一身黄军服，
    黑红的脸面有精神，
    那人一见桂贞忙站起，
    正是德强哥桂贞可认得清，
    桂贞含羞带笑要叫德强哥，
    不知为什么话到唇边发不出声音，
    脸面上发烧头发涨，
    珠泪颗颗往下倾，
    低头一旁弄衣角，
    眼睛也不敢来瞧人，
    半天两人没有说话，
    还是德强先开声，
    叫了声：“桂贞请坐下，
    不要难过安安心，
    恨只恨那国民党，
    旧社会好比那陷人坑，
    你我都是人生父母养，
    谁也想安份守己作个好人，
    可恨那旧社会旧制度，
    穷人的性命不如畜牲，
    妇女就更是受痛苦，
    任人践踏与侮凌，
    现在全国快解放了，
    封建黑暗制度快消灭尽，
    翻身的日子来到了，
    我们都应该大高兴，
    过去的事儿我都能原谅，
    这不能怨你一个人，
    只要你从今后好好学习，
    把仇人恩人要分清，
    学习文化学习劳动，
    改变思想换脑筋，
    只要你进步不嫌弃我，
    德强不是忘恩负义人。”
    桂贞点头叫“德强，
    你的话儿我记的清，
    我明白国民党害了我，
    我明白共产党是恩人，
    从今后我安心来学习，
    改变思想要作个劳动人，
    还望你常常指教我，
    我永远的把你记在心。
    果然桂贞听了劝，
    工作学习她很认真，
    有的姐妹还想不转，
    她常常还去帮助人，
    斗争了领家张文才，
    斗争了坏蛋孙德英，
    常言说天下无难事，
    只怕没有下恒心，
    学习不满三个月，
    样样能来样样精，
    梅毒病症也全治好，
    身体发胖有精神，
    工作人员个个都说她好，
    把他介绍到金花的厂里当工人，
    姐妹俩一块作工真高兴，
    德强也常常来看她们，
    桂贞也认识了金花的未婚夫，
    是一个老老实实的好工人，
    转眼到了年根底，
    解放后的新年分外高兴，
    工友们个个来贺喜，
    四个人两对结了婚。
    感谢共产党毛主席，
    烟花女儿大翻身。
                                                      （全文完）
