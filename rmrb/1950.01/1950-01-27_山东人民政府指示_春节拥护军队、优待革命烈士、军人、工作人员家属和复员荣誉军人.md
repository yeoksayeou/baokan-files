    Shandong People's Government Instruction
    During the Spring Festival, Support the Army, Give Preferential Treatment to the Families of Revolutionary Martyrs, Military Personnel, Staff Members, and Demobilized Honored Servicemen

    (Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 26th) The Shandong Provincial People's Government recently issued instructions regarding supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, staff members, and demobilized honored servicemen during the Spring Festival. The instructions stated: Governments at all levels must regard supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs, military personnel, staff members, and demobilized honored servicemen as a regular task and responsibility of the government, and must educate the people to regard these tasks as the duty of every individual. During the Spring Festival, checks should be made at the village level on the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs, military personnel, staff members, and demobilized honored servicemen over the past year, and conventions and substitute cultivation plans should be formulated. Regarding the families of martyrs, military personnel, staff members, and demobilized honored servicemen who have labor power, priority should be given to organizing and supporting their production to achieve self-reliance; those without labor power must be given special care to prevent land from lying waste and to prevent them from suffering from cold and hunger. In cities, assistance should be provided in finding employment. During the Spring Festival, various forms of condolences should be carried out (such as writing letters of condolence, holding forums, and get-togethers), but extravagance must be avoided.
