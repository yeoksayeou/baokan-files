Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 26th – Chongqing, once the last nest of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gangs and therefore teeming with reactionary elements, secret agents and bandits, has seen the preliminary establishment of revolutionary order since liberation, thanks to the vigorous rectification by the Municipal People's Government. According to statistics from the Municipal Public Security Bureau: nearly a thousand die-hard secret agents and other elements have been arrested; 584 secret agents have voluntarily registered and repented; 735 cases of disturbing social order have been cracked; and more than 9,000 scattered soldiers and vagrants have been taken in. A total of 7,972 guns, four artillery pieces of various types, more than 213,000 rounds of ammunition, four radio stations, and seven transmitters/receivers have been seized. The so-called "Anti-Communist Protect-the-People Army," which the bandit leader Yang Sen forced the citizens to organize, has been disbanded. The old police personnel have also been given preliminary rectification, and a rotational training method will be adopted to transform their thinking and style, and help them establish the idea of serving the people. In addition, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has carefully checked the city's household registration and appropriately reorganized the order of vendors and dockworkers. After these correct measures, the order in the city has become increasingly stable.

    重庆市革命秩序初步建立
    【新华社重庆二十六日电】曾为国民党残余匪帮西南巢穴，因而反动分子、特务匪徒充斥的重庆市，自解放以来，经市人民政府大力整顿，革命秩序已初步建立。据市公安局统计：共捕获怙恶不悛的特务分子等近千人，自动登记悔过自新的特务分子五百八十四人；破获各种扰乱社会秩序案件共七百三十五件；收容散兵游勇九千余名。收缴枪枝七千九百七十二支，各种炮四门，子弹二十一万三千多发，电台四部，收发报机七部。匪首杨森强迫市民组织的所谓“反共保民军”，已予解散。对旧警察人员，亦已予初步整顿，并将采取轮训办法，改造他们的思想和作风，帮助他们树立为人民服务的思想。此外，市公安局认真地检查了全市户口，并适当地整理了摊贩和码头上的秩序。经过这些正确的措施后，市内秩序已益趋安定。
