Opened a Path to Victory
—Some Understanding of "Sons and Daughters of China"
Mei Lingyi

    "Sons and Daughters of China," based on one of the historical facts of the heroic struggle of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army around the time of the July 7th Incident, not only demonstrates the great spirit of Chinese women (people) dedicating themselves to the cause of liberation, but also, through this story, shows how people unwilling to be enslaved armed themselves under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, striking the Japanese invaders in numerous battles, and opening a path to victory.

    Opening a path to victory is not a simple matter. In "Sons and Daughters of China" itself, we can see, first of all, the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. When the number one war criminal Chiang Kai-shek shamelessly sold out the Northeast after the September 18th Incident, it was the Chinese Communist Party that organized and developed the people's armed forces, from the initial guerrillas to the Anti-Japanese United Army, finally cooperating with the Soviet Red Army to clear out the Japanese invaders. During this long period of struggle, the Chinese Communist Party sent out excellent party members, and excellent party members continued to sacrifice gloriously. Leng Yun, Hu Xiuzhi, Yang Shuzhen, the Korean An Dajie, Xiao Jin... in "Sons and Daughters of China" are such martyrs.

    The awakening and organization of the people to participate in the battle is the second factor in opening a path to victory. However, this is still inextricably linked to the Chinese Communist Party. The Kuomintang reactionaries suppressed the people out of fear and hostility, and they themselves stood on the side of the people's enemies. Only the Chinese Communist Party is the party of the proletariat, representing the will of the people, and calling on the people to awaken and organize. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can the people be well organized and exert their strength. Hu Xiuzhi's path, who suffered all kinds of bullying from landlords and Japanese invaders, finally joined the Anti-Japanese United Army, and became a glorious party member through the party's education and combat training, is the path of thousands upon thousands of Chinese people. This path is broad, and everyone can walk it. Thus, we have seen the Anti-Japanese United Army grow stronger day by day, with enough strength to defeat any enemy.

    The Anti-Japanese United Army (and all people's armed forces) is the people's own army. Soldiers shed blood for the people (that is, for themselves), and the people will certainly support their own army. It can be said that such a foundation was established from the Red Army era and became one of the excellent traditions. Without such a relationship, the path to victory cannot be opened. Without such a relationship, no matter how strong the army is, it will inevitably be defeated. Here, we still cannot do without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. We know that for twenty-eight years, the Party has educated the people's army in this way.

    "Workers of all countries, unite!" The spirit of internationalism developed based on this slogan is also manifested in the guerrilla warfare in the Northeast. An Dajie and Xiao Jin, etc. in "Sons and Daughters of China" are Koreans, and the presence of Korean people in the Anti-Japanese United Army precisely illustrates that Japanese fascism is not only the enemy of the Chinese people, but also the enemy of all oppressed nations (and also the enemy of the Japanese people). It is absolutely necessary for the people to stand together, side by side, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, or skin color, and fight against Japanese fascism and today's international reactionary camp. Precisely because this point was implemented, the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army was able to achieve victory more easily.

    Finally, we must also point out that the Chinese people's tradition of unyielding and arduous struggle is also something we cannot ignore. This tradition is possessed by the working class, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, and is especially manifested in dedicating themselves to the cause of liberation and dedicating themselves to the revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party. This tradition, precisely under the education of the Chinese Communist Party (directly and indirectly), has been highly developed.

    Due to these factors, the struggle of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, as demonstrated by the historical facts of "Sons and Daughters of China," opened a path to victory. This spirit of heroic sacrifice is not only immortal, but also worth learning: the spirit of opening a path to victory—the excellent qualities of the Bolsheviks—is also necessary for embarking on the road of construction!

    开辟了胜利的道路
    ——对《中华女儿》的一点认识
    梅令宜
    取材于七七抗战前后东北抗日联军的英勇斗争的史实之一的《中华女儿》，不仅仅表现了中国妇女（人民）的献身解放事业的伟大精神，而且，通过了这样的故事，表现了不甘被奴役的人民怎样在中国共产党领导之下武装起来，以无数次的战斗打击着日寇，开辟了胜利的道路。
    开辟了胜利的道路不是一件简单的事情。就在《中华女儿》里，我们也可以看到，首先是中国共产党的正确领导。当头号战犯蒋介石在九一八后无耻的出卖了东北之际，正是中国共产党组织了并发展了人民武装力量，由最初的游击队到抗日联军，终于配合了苏联红军，清除了日寇。在这长时期的斗争中，中国共产党派出了优秀的党员，并且，不断的有优秀的党员光荣的牺牲了。《中华女儿》中的冷云、胡秀之、杨淑贞、朝鲜籍的安大姐、小金……就是这样的烈士。
    人民的觉醒并组织起来参加战斗，是开辟了胜利的道路的第二个因素。但，这仍旧是和中国共产党骨肉相联不可分割的。国民党反动派是由于畏惧与敌视而对人民实行镇压的，他们自己就是和人民的敌人站在一边的。只有中国共产党，是无产阶级的政党，代表着人民的意志，召唤着人民觉醒起来、组织起来。也只有在中国共产党的领导下，人民才可能好好的组织起来，发挥着自己的力量。受尽地主与日寇的欺凌，终于投入抗日联军，在党的教育与战斗锻炼之中，成为一个光荣的党员的胡秀之的道路，乃是千千万万中国人民的道路。这条道路是广阔的，是人人可以走的，于是，我们看见了抗日联军的一天一天的壮大起来，有足够的力量打垮任何敌人了。
    抗日联军（以及一切人民武装力量）是人民自己的队伍，战士为人民（也就是为自己）流血，人民一定支持自己的队伍。可以这么说，从红军时代起，就建立了这样的基础，而成为优良的传统之一了。没有这样的关系，胜利的道路是不可能开辟出来的。没有这样的关系，无论多么强大，那军队是必然被打垮的。这里，仍旧离不开中国共产党的领导，我们知道，二十八年来，党就这样的教育着人民的队伍。
    “全世界的无产者，联合起来！”基于这一口号发展起来的国际主义的精神，也显示于东北的游击战争中间了。《中华女儿》中的安大姐和小金等等是朝鲜人，抗日联军中有朝鲜人民，正说明了：日本法西斯不仅是中国人民的敌人，也是一切被压迫民族的敌人（也是日本人民的敌人）。和日本法西斯以及今天的国际反动阵营进行战斗，人民是不分国籍、不分民族、不分肤色的站在一道，并肩作战，是完全必要的。正因为执行了这一点，东北抗日联军较容易的得到了胜利。
    最后，我们还必须指出，中国人民的不屈不挠、艰苦战斗的传统，也是我们不可忽略的。这种传统，是工人阶级、农民、革命的知识分子所具有的，而特别在献身于解放事业，献身于中国共产党领导的革命之际显现出来。这种传统，恰恰又是在中国共产党的教育（直接的和间接的）之下，得到了高度的发扬。
    由于这些因素，通过了《中华女儿》的史实所表现的东北抗日联军的斗争，开辟了胜利的道路。这种英勇牺牲的精神，不仅是永垂不朽的，而且是值得我们学习的：开辟了胜利的道路的精神——布尔什维克的优良品质，也是走上建设的道路所必需的！（附图片）
