Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 25th: TASS, Ulaanbaatar, January 24th: The Presidium of the Small Khural (i.e., the supreme organ of state power during the recess of the Great People's Khural) of the Mongolian People's Republic has made certain changes to the composition of the government. Considering that Marshal Choibalsan's main work in the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic is too busy and at his own request, the Presidium of the Small Khural will relieve Marshal Choibalsan of his concurrent posts as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of the Armed Forces, and appoint Lhamsuren, the current Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, as Minister of Foreign Affairs; and appoint Major General Zhanchiv, the current Deputy Minister of the Armed Forces, as Minister of the Armed Forces.
