    Northeast Opera Improvement Association Established
    Determined to Eliminate Toxic Elements in Old Operas Within Two Years.
    [Report from this newspaper] The Northeast Opera Improvement Association has been established and is about to begin work, with a target of completely eliminating toxic elements in old operas within the Northeast region within two years. Shu Qun, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles, pointed out at the inaugural meeting of the Northeast Opera Improvement Association: Because adapting scripts is faster and easier to popularize than creating them, and because Northeast opera workers have already formed a unified organization, it has become possible to eliminate toxic elements in old operas in the Northeast within two years. Liu Zhiming, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, spoke at the executive committee meeting of the association, encouraging the drama workers to gloriously shoulder the task of eliminating toxins from old operas, hoping that everyone would work hard to overcome the difficulties encountered in the process of reforming old operas, actively promote the work, and pay attention to strengthening unity and mutual learning. The executive committee of the association has put forward specific opinions on the reform work, deciding that: the focus of the reform work should be on provincial capitals and large cities, and use this as a center to influence small cities, and systematically promote it to the whole area; organize a review committee, announce forbidden and permitted repertoires, and implement them in stages in a planned and step-by-step manner; in order to concentrate efforts and strengthen popularization work, the scripts that have been reformed in various places should be concentrated to the local opera improvement association or the Northeast Opera Improvement Association for review and publication; hold opera reform training classes to centrally train writers and directors; promote various theaters to formulate plans based on their strength and conditions, and complete the adaptation work within a certain period.

    【本报讯】东北戏曲改进会成立，即将展开工作，预定在二年之内全部肃清东北区内旧戏剧中的有毒因素。东北文联副主席舒群在东北戏曲改进会成立会上致词时指出：由于剧本改编较之创作为快，容易普及，以及东北戏曲工作者已经产生了统一的组织，东北在二年之内肃清旧戏有毒因素工作，已经成为可能。中共中央东北局宣传部副部长刘芝明在该会执委会上讲话，对戏剧工作者光荣担负起肃清旧剧毒素这一任务，加以勉励，希望大家努力克服在改造旧戏过程中遭遇的困难，主动推动工作，并注意加强团结，互相学习。该会执委对于改造工作已提出具体意见，决定：改造工作重点放在各省会与大城市，并以此为中心去影响小城市，有计划的推广到全面；组织审查委员会，公布禁演与准演剧目，有计划、有步骤地分期执行；为集中力量与加强普及工作，各地已经改造的剧本应集中到当地戏曲改进会或东北戏曲改进会审查、出版；举办改戏训练班，集中训练编导人员；推动各剧院根据其力量与条件，订出计划，在一定时期内完成改编工作。
