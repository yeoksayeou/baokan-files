[From Our Correspondent in the Northeast] The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Liaodong Province has recently summarized the experiences of various factories in establishing apprenticeship contracts. The summary affirmed that establishing apprenticeship contracts is a good method for advanced workers to promote the backward, for young people to learn from adults, to rapidly improve technology, and to train a large number of skilled workers. The summary pointed out: The shortcomings in the contracts established by various factories are that some factories' contracts are too general and difficult to implement, or they emphasize the study of technical theory while neglecting practical operation methods. Some teachers teach too many apprentices and cannot take care of them all; some factories set too short a time frame, the reward system is not clear, and there is little encouragement for teachers. These shortcomings should be resolved in a timely manner. The summary puts forward the following main experiences: (1) There are currently four forms of apprenticeship contracts: First, a single contract: one teacher and one apprentice sign a contract, stipulating a certain time period to teach a certain skill; Second, a chain contract: several teachers teach several apprentices, each using their expertise to teach; Third, a collective contract: all apprentices and teachers in the factory workshop sign a contract, and then divide the work for learning; Fourth, an apprentice night school: It is based on a collective contract, in addition to regular study, the trade union assigns teachers to use the night school form to teach apprentices. Judging from these forms, a single contract is too backward, a chain contract is a step forward, and collective contracts and apprentice night schools are advanced forms that can be promoted. (2) Regularly examining apprentices for upgrading and rewarding teachers is a good way to promote the advancement of apprenticeship contracts. In an examination at the Anshan Machine Factory, twelve of the ninety apprentices were promoted to skilled workers, which immediately increased their wages. Apprentices all look forward to upgrading and increasing wages, so they stepped up their technical learning; teachers were afraid of their apprentices losing face, so they stepped up their teaching. Now the general mentality is: "If the apprentice does well in the exam, the teacher will be rewarded and honored." (3) The basic key to establishing apprenticeship contracts is to break through the teachers' thinking and overcome the idea of technical conservatism. It now appears that, in addition to various rewards, the best way is to carry out "technical grievance sessions", using "technical grievance sessions" to enlighten the class consciousness of technical workers, break down conservative thinking, and wholeheartedly educate apprentices. (4) To advance apprenticeship contracts, each factory must take the Youth League as the center, carry out education on respecting teachers and loving apprentices, and launch a movement to respect teachers and love apprentices, educate apprentices to respect and unite with teachers with practical actions, and everyone should take the initiative to improve relations so that the contract can be better implemented. (5) The administrative departments should promptly conduct worker examinations, apprentice upgrades, and teacher rewards, commend those who implement the contract well, and criticize those who do not implement it well. Summarize experience at any time, educate all technical workers and apprentices, and improve the movement one step further.

    打破技术保守思想  按期考试升级给奖
    安东总结订立师徒合同经验
    四种师徒合同形式
    以集体合同、学徒夜校为最好。
    【本报东北讯】辽东省中共安东市委顷将各厂订立师徒合同的经验作出总结。总结肯定了订立师徒合同是先进推动落后，青年向成年学习，迅速提高技术，大批培养技术工人的好办法。总结指出：各厂订立合同中的缺点是，有些厂订的合同太笼统，不易执行，或则重视了技术理论的学习，而忽视了实际操作法。有的老师教的学徒太多，照顾不过来；有些厂时间订得太短，奖励制度不明确，对老师鼓励少。这些缺点均待及时解决。总结提出目前的主要经验有以下几点：（一）目前师徒合同的形式有四种：一、单一合同：一个老师和一个学徒订立合同，规定一定时间，教会一定技术；二、连环合同：几个老师教几个学徒，各人发挥专长去教；三、集体合同：全厂车间所有学徒与老师订立合同，然后分工学习；四、学徒夜校：它是在集体合同的基础上，除平时的学习外，由工会分配老师利用夜校形式教学徒。就这几种形式看来，单一合同太落后，连环合同进了一步，集体合同和学徒夜校是高级的形式，可以提倡。（二）对学徒，按期考试升级，对老师，按期给奖，是推动师徒合同前进的好办法。安东机器厂在一次考工中，九十名学徒中十二名升为熟练工，马上提高了工资。学徒都盼升级、提高工资，就加紧学习技术；老师怕徒弟丢脸，就加紧教。现在大家普遍的心理是：“徒弟考好了，老师又得奖又光荣。”（三）订立师徒合同的基本关键是打通老师思想，克服保守技术的思想。现在看来，除各种奖励外，顶好的办法是进行“技术诉苦”，用“技术诉苦”启发技术工人的阶级觉悟，打破保守思想，热诚安心地教育徒弟。（四）要把师徒合同推向前进，各厂必须以青年团为中心，进行尊师爱徒的教育，开展尊师爱徒运动，教育徒弟以实际行动去尊敬老师，团结老师，大家主动搞好关系，才能把合同执行得更好。（五）行政方面要及时进行考工、学徒升级、老师给奖，执行合同好的给以表扬，执行不好的给以批评。随时总结经验，教育全体技术工人及学徒，把运动提高一步。
