    “Violating Conventions”
    The Chinese people have become the masters of the new China and want to abolish the imperialists' aggressive "privileges" in China. Therefore, the gentlemen of Wall Street are yelling about violating "international conventions."
    Yes, not allowing mosquitoes and bedbugs to live by sucking blood, in the eyes of mosquitoes and bedbugs, is not only "violating conventions" but can also be said to be violating nature.
    However, the Chinese people, who have already stood up, are determined to specifically violate these "conventions" and "nature."
    Buzz buzz buzz.... What's the use?

    “违反惯例”
    中国人民作了新中国的主人，要取消帝国主义者在华的侵略“特权”，于是华尔街的老爷们大叫违反“国际惯例”。
    是的，不准蚊子、臭虫吸血为生，在蚊子、臭虫们看来，不仅是“违反惯例”，而且可以说是违反自然。
    然而，已经站立起来了的中国人民就是要专门违反这些“惯例”和“自然”的。
    嗡嗡嗡……。有什么用处呢。
