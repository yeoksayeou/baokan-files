    Commemorating Lenin
    Wu Yuzhang

    We are particularly excited to commemorate Lenin, the great teacher of mankind, at the time of the Chinese people's victory this year (1950).

    Lenin's revolutionary theory armed the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary people of China. Lenin's Bolshevik organizational principles and struggle experience educated the Chinese Communist Party. Above all, Lenin's lifelong care for the Chinese people and his greatest hope and confidence in the victory of the Chinese revolution encouraged our Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary people of China.

    As early as 1900, when the so-called "civilized" Eight-Nation Alliance of Europe massacred the Chinese people, and the world condemned the Chinese as barbarians, only Lenin stood up to defend the Chinese people. In the first issue of *Iskra* he discussed the causes of the Boxer Rebellion in China, exposed the plundering nature of the war against China by Tsarist Russia and other imperialist countries, and pointed out the attitude of socialists toward this war.

    After the victory of the Xinhai Revolution in China in 1912, Lenin, in a resolution of the Bolshevik Party, specifically pointed out the world significance of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle: "This revolutionary struggle will liberate Asia and destroy the rule of the European bourgeoisie..." and expressed that the Russian proletariat watched the success of the Chinese people with sincere excitement and full sympathy.

    In 1913, Lenin wrote an article entitled "Backward Europe and Advanced Asia." Everyone generally knows that Europe is advanced and Asia is backward. Why did Lenin use such a title? He explained himself: "The title of this article contains a bitter truth." Because: "Advanced Europe, with its extraordinarily developed technology, its rich culture and constitutional civilization in all respects, has reached such a historical juncture that the bourgeoisie in power, fearing the growing and increasingly powerful proletariat, is defending all that is backward, decadent, and medieval. The increasingly decadent bourgeoisie is uniting with all the forces that have already decayed and are decaying in an attempt to preserve the tottering system of wage slavery. ...In 'advanced' Europe, only the proletariat is the advanced class." Because: "In Asia, powerful democratic movements are growing, expanding, and consolidating everywhere. There, the bourgeoisie is still fighting reactionary forces alongside the people. Hundreds of millions of people have awakened and are fighting for survival, for light, for freedom."

    Lenin continued: "Helping the reactionary forces in Asia for the private interests of financial giants and capitalist swindlers is one of the most striking examples of the increasing corruption of the entire European bourgeoisie. ...All fair-minded democrats are filled with sympathy for young Asia, while 'advanced' Europe? It is plundering China, helping the enemies of Chinese democracy, helping the enemies of Chinese freedom." Lenin cited as an example the fact that the five-nation banking consortium lent Yuan Shikai 25 million pounds in April 1913 on extremely harsh terms, the so-called "reorganization loan," to suppress the Chinese revolution. "Why does it (referring to Europe - author) support Yuan Shikai?" Lenin said, "It is for the private interests of speculative capitalists. ...But what if the Chinese people do not recognize this loan? Now China is a republic, and what if the majority in its parliament opposes this loan? Ah! Then 'advanced' Europe will shout about 'civilization,' 'order,' 'culture,' and 'fatherland'! Then it will dispatch artillery and unite with the adventurer, traitor, and friend of the reactionary forces—Yuan Shikai—to extinguish this republic in 'backward' Asia."

    Lenin emphasized: "All the ruling forces in Europe, the entire European bourgeoisie, have formed an alliance with all the reactionary and medieval forces in China." Lenin concluded: "The whole of young Asia, that is, the workers of Asia, have reliable allies headed by the proletariat of all civilized countries. No force in the world can stop the victory of the proletariat, and this victory will liberate the people of Europe and the people of Asia together."

    Today, the world's imperialists, allied with all the reactionary and medieval remnants in Asia, especially the American imperialists allied with the reactionary forces in China to oppose the Chinese people, openly aiding Chiang Kai-shek with aircraft, artillery, and hundreds of millions of dollars, have suffered a shameful defeat and are still unwilling to give up, still attempting to disrupt all of China with the small island of Taiwan. This further proves that dying capitalism is at the end of its rope, attempting to make a last desperate struggle, not only losing its past "civilization," but also losing human reason.

    The present era is very different from the era of thirty-six years ago. The world already has a complete camp of peace and democracy with a population of eight hundred million, contiguous and headed by the socialist state of the Soviet Union; the current China is also different from the China of thirty-six years ago. China has a strong, Marxist-Leninist, Bolshevik Chinese Communist Party headed by Mao Zedong, leading the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie, defeating domestic and foreign enemies, and establishing a brand new New Democratic People's Republic of China.

    The reason why our Chinese revolution has achieved such a great and splendid victory today is entirely because Lenin's revolutionary theory guided us, and Lenin's sympathy helped us. Every time we read Lenin's articles praising our Chinese people as a great people with a great future, it strengthens our determination to fight for the revolution and our confidence in the victory of the revolution a hundredfold.

    Because Lenin's brilliant prediction that the Chinese revolution would inevitably be victorious did not stem from good intentions, nor did it stem from compassion for the suffering of the Chinese people, but from the historical laws of the development of human society, and from the truth of dialectical materialism. Dialectics believes that:

    "What is most important is not what seems strong at the moment, but has already begun to decay, but what is being produced, what is developing, even if it does not seem strong at the moment, because in dialectics, only what is being produced, what is developing, is invincible." (A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), page 135)

    Therefore, "It is not necessary to rely on the strata in society that are no longer developing, even if these strata are still a dominant force at the moment, but to rely on the strata in society that are developing and have a bright future, even if these strata are not a dominant force at the moment." (Ibid., p. 140)

    We Communists firmly believe in this truth, and we always strive unremittingly, no matter what difficulties we encounter.

    Today, the Chinese people's revolution has won victory throughout China. We must work harder to build our new country, transforming our agricultural country into an industrial country, transforming a backward country into an advanced country. We must master the most advanced science and technology, catch up with and surpass capitalist countries. We must work together with the Soviet Union and many new democratic countries to build the most happy communist society for mankind, and commemorate Lenin with such practical actions!

    纪念列宁
    吴玉章
    今年（一九五○年），在中国人民胜利的时候来纪念人类伟大的导师列宁，特别使我们兴奋。
    列宁的革命理论武装了中国共产党和中国革命的人民，列宁的布尔塞维克的组织原则和斗争经验，教育了中国共产党，尤其是列宁的一生对中国人民的爱护，对中国人民革命胜利的最大的希望和最大的信心，鼓励了我们中国共产党和中国革命的人民。
    远在一九○○年欧洲所谓“文明”的八国联军屠杀中国人民的时候，举世都骂中国人为野蛮，只有列宁挺身出来为中国人民辩护，他在《火星报》第一期上，论述中国义和团起义的原因，揭露帝俄及其他帝国主义国家对中国战争的掠夺性质，并指明社会主义者对于这一战争的态度。
    一九一二年中国辛亥革命胜利后，列宁在布尔塞维克党的决议中，特别指出了中国人民革命斗争的世界意义：“这个革命斗争将使亚洲获得解放，而摧毁欧洲资产阶级的统治……”，并表明俄国无产阶级以衷诚的兴奋和充分的同情，注视中国人民的成功。
    一九一三年列宁写了一篇文章，题目是《落后的欧洲与先进的亚洲》。一般人都知道，欧洲是先进的，亚洲是落后的。列宁为什么用这样一个题目呢？他自己解释说：“本文的标题实在含有苦味的真理。”因为：“具有异常发展的技术，具有丰富的各方面的文化和宪法的文明而先进的欧洲，已经进到了这样一个历史关头，此时发号施令的资产阶级，因惧怕日益增长和日益强大的无产阶级，却维护一切落后的、衰亡的、中世纪的东西了。日益衰亡的资产阶级和一切已经衰亡及正在衰亡的势力联合起来，以图保存那正在动摇的雇佣奴隶制度。……在‘先进’的欧洲，只有无产阶级才是先进的阶级。”因为：“在亚洲，到处正在增长、扩大和巩固着强大的民主运动。在那里，资产阶级还与人民一同反对反动势力，几万万人民已经觉醒起来，争取生存，争取光明，争取自由了。”
    列宁继续指出：“为了财政巨头和资本家骗子们的私利而去帮助亚洲的反动势力，这是整个欧洲资产阶级的这种日趋腐化的一个最显著的例子。……一切公正的民主主义者都对于年青的亚洲充满着同情，而‘先进’的欧洲呢？却在掠夺中国，却在帮助中国民主主义的敌人，却在帮助中国自由的敌人。”列宁把一九一三年四月五国银行团以极苛刻条件借予袁世凯所谓“善后借款”二千五百万镑，以镇压中国革命一事作为例子。“为什么它（指欧洲——笔者）要拥护袁世凯呢？——列宁说——是为了投机资本家的私利。……但如果中国人民不承认这笔借款，那又怎样呢？现在中国是共和国，而其国会中的多数，如果反对这笔借款，怎么办呢？啊！那时候，‘先进’的欧洲就高呼什么‘文明’、‘秩序’、‘文化’、‘祖国’了！那时候，它就调去大炮，跟冒险家、卖国贼、反动势力的朋友——袁世凯联合起来，扑灭‘落后’亚洲的这个共和国了。”
    列宁着重指出：“欧洲一切当权的势力，整个欧洲的资产阶级，与中国反动的和中世纪的一切势力结成联盟了。”列宁的结论说：“整个青年的亚洲，就是说亚洲劳动者，却有以一切文明国家的无产阶级为首的可靠的同盟者。世界上任何力量都不能阻止无产阶级的胜利，而这胜利将把欧洲人民和亚洲人民一同解放出来。”
    现在世界帝国主义者，与亚洲的反动的和中世纪的一切残余势力结成联盟，特别是美国帝国主义者与中国的反动势力结成联盟来反对中国人民，公开地以飞机、大炮、数十万万金钱来援助蒋介石，遭到了可耻的惨败，还不肯罢手，还想以台湾一小岛来扰乱全中国。这就更证明了垂死的资本主义日暮途穷，妄想作最后的疯狂挣扎，不仅丧失了过去的“文明”，而且丧失了人类的理性。
    现在的时代已和三十六年前的时代大不相同了。世界上已经有了以社会主义国家苏联为首的八万万人口的壤地相连的完整的一个和平民主阵营；现在的中国也和三十六年前的中国不同了。中国有了坚强的、马列主义的、布尔塞维主义的以毛泽东为首的中国共产党，领导着工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级，战胜了国内外的敌人，建立了崭新的新民主主义的中华人民共和国。
    我们中国革命有了今天这样伟大的辉煌的胜利，完全是由于列宁的革命理论指导了我们，列宁的同情帮助了我们，我们每读到列宁的文章中称赞我们中国人民为伟大的人民，有伟大的前途，使人百倍地坚强了革命奋斗的决心和革命胜利的信心。
    因为，列宁对于中国革命必然胜利这个天才的预言，不是从善良的愿望出发，不是从可怜中国人民受苦受难的慈悲心出发，而是从人类社会发展的历史规律出发，而是从辩证唯物主义的真理出发。辩证法认为：
    “最重要的不是现时似乎坚固，但已经开始衰亡的东西，而是正在产生、正在发展的东西，那怕它现时似乎还不坚固，因为在辩证法看来，只有正在产生、正在发展的东西，才是不可战胜的。”（联共（布）党史简明教程一三五页）
    因此，“不是要指靠社会里已经不再发展的阶层，那怕这些阶层在现时还是占优势的力量，而是要指靠社会里正在发展、具有远大前途的阶层，那怕这些阶层在现时还不是占优势的力量。”（同上，一四○页）
    我们共产党人坚信这个真理，无论遇到何种困难，总是奋斗不懈的。
    今天中国人民革命在全中国获得了胜利，我们必须加倍努力来建设我们新的国家，变我们农业国为工业国，变落后的国家为先进的国家。我们要掌握最进步的科学技术，迎头赶上并超过资本主义的国家，我们要和苏联社会主义国家及许多新民主主义国家共同奋斗，建设人类最幸福的共产主义社会，以这样的实际行动来纪念列宁！
