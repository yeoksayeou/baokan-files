Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: The People's Supervisory Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council held its fourth meeting on the 11th of this month. The meeting heard Director Tan Pingshan's report on the committee's organizational nature, tasks, and work plan, as well as Director Dong Luan of the Hebei Provincial People's Supervisory Department's report on the department's work over the past six months, and unanimously approved the committee's trial organizational regulations. The meeting also had a principled discussion on the draft general rules for the organization of the People's Supervisory Committees of the Greater Administrative Areas. In his report, Director Tan Pingshan pointed out that the old democratic regime's separation of supervision and administration was a deceptive formality for the people, while our new democratic regime's organization of supervisory bodies under the Government Administration Council allows the supervisory bodies to truly exert their effectiveness. The task of our supervisory organs is not only negative sanctions, but mainly to actively promote a revolutionary work style that is honest, simple, cherishes national property, and serves the people, and to prevent the emergence of corruption, waste, damage to national property, and bureaucratic work styles that are divorced from the masses. Director Tan said: People's supervisory work must follow the mass line and mobilize the masses to participate in supervisory work. The People's Supervisory Committee is preparing to appoint public correspondent supervisors and organize correspondent supervision groups in various government departments and occupational organizations. At present, the central task of the People's Supervisory Committee is to improve internal organization, promote the establishment of supervisory bodies at all levels above the county and city, replenish cadres, establish a supervisory network with key points, and strengthen ties with relevant departments of the Central People's Government to carry out work. He called on supervisory personnel to improve their political level and study professional knowledge to facilitate supervisory work.

    监察委员会举行四次会议
    谭平山主任作报告
    指出监察机关任务在于推动厉行廉洁的、朴素的、爱护国家资财的、为人民服务的革命工作作风
    【新华社北京十六日电】中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会于本月十一日举行第四次委员会议。会议听取了谭平山主任关于该会组织性质、任务与工作计划的报告以及河北省人民政府人民监察院董鲁安院长关于该院半年来的工作报告，并一致通过该会试行组织条例。会议对大行政区人民监察委员会组织通则草案亦有原则性之讨论。谭平山主任的报告中，指出旧民主主义政权组织将监察与行政分立是欺骗人民的形式，而我们新民主主义政权组织将监察机关隶属于政务院，这就使监察机关能真正发挥其效力。我们监察机关的任务不仅在于消极的制裁，而主要地在于从积极方面推动厉行廉洁的、朴素的、爱护国家资财的、为人民服务的革命工作作风，防止贪污、浪费、破坏国家资财、脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风的产生。谭主任说：人民监察工作必须走群众路线，发动群众参加监察工作。人民监察委员会准备在政府各部门、各职业团体中聘请公开的通讯监察员，组织通讯监察小组。目前人民监察委员会的中心工作，是健全内部组织机构，推动县市以上各级政府监察机构的成立，充实干部，有重点地建立监察网，加强与中央人民政府各有关部门的联系以开展工作。他号召监察工作人员提高政治水平，学习专业知识，以利监察工作。
