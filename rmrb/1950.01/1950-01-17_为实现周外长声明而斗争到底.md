Fight to the End to Realize Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement

    At the United Nations Security Council meeting on the 13th of this month, the Soviet delegation solemnly announced to the world: "Until the Kuomintang clique's representative is expelled from the Security Council, the Soviet delegation will not participate in the work of the Security Council." The Soviet delegation supported our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement of January 8th with resolute and just action, once again demonstrating that the Soviet Union is China's best friend. We warmly thank our friendly neighbor, the Soviet Union, and we will be even more full of confidence, using every effort to thwart the conspiracies of imperialism, eliminate the remaining Kuomintang bandits, and fight to the end to fully realize Foreign Minister Zhou's statement.

    The Chinese people will never recognize the existence of the so-called Chiang Ting-fu delegation today, because it not only never could represent the Chinese people, but even the Kuomintang reactionary government it once represented no longer exists. The reason why this so-called "delegation" that represents no one still exists in the United Nations and the Security Council is nothing more than the patronage of U.S. imperialism and its collaborators. The U.S. imperialists' attempt to use a dead soul to obstruct the Chinese people from sending their true representatives to the Security Council merely shows that they are afraid of the power of the victorious Chinese people and the significant contributions they have made and will make to international peace. Here, we must solemnly warn the U.S. imperialists that this is futile. China is already the country of the Chinese people, and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government representing the Chinese people. Only the representatives of the Chinese people themselves are qualified to sit in the Chinese seat in the United Nations and the Security Council. The United Nations and the Security Council can only be worthy of the name with the participation of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China; otherwise, it is merely a tool of U.S. imperialism, tantamount to announcing its own death.

    Those who opposed the Soviet proposal in the Security Council included not only the representatives of the U.S. government and the French government, but also the representatives of the British and Norwegian governments, which recently announced their willingness to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. This is extremely puzzling. They adopted double-dealing tactics, and by abstaining, they actually supported the United States in opposing the Chinese people's exercise of their legitimate rights. This action cannot but be regarded as an unfriendly act towards the people of New China.

    The Chinese people believe that a Security Council without the participation of the Soviet delegation, without the participation of the New China delegation, and instead tolerating the participation of a ghost Chiang Ting-fu delegation, is illegal, and all the issues it discusses and all the resolutions it makes are invalid and hostile to the Chinese people and the just people of the world, and the Chinese people must oppose it to the end.

    为实现周外长声明而斗争到底
    在本月十三日举行的联合国安理会上，苏联代表团向全世界庄严地宣告：“在国民党集团代表被逐出安理会以前，苏联代表团将不参加安理会工作。”苏联代表团以坚决的正义的行动支持了我国周恩来外长一月八日的声明，又一次表明了苏联是中国最好的朋友。我们热烈感谢友邦苏联，我们将更加充满信心，用一切努力挫败帝国主义的阴谋，肃清国民党残余匪帮，为完全实现周外长声明而斗争到底。
    中国人民决不承认今天还有什么所谓蒋廷黻代表团的存在，因为它不仅从来不能代表中国人民，而且连它所曾经代表过的国民党反动政府也已经不存在了。这个不代表任何人的所谓“代表团”之所以至今还在联合国和安理会存在着，无非是由于美帝国主义及其合作者的豢养。美帝国主义者妄想用一个死魂灵来阻挠中国人民派遣自己的真正代表出席安理会，无非是表示他们害怕胜利了的中国人民的力量及其对国际和平所已作的和未作的重大供献。在这里，我们应当正告美帝国主义者，这是徒劳的。中国已经是中国人民的国家，中华人民共和国中央人民政府是代表中国人民的唯一合法政府，联合国和安理会的中国代表席位，只有中国人民自己的代表才有资格去坐。联合国和安理会也只有有了苏联和中华人民共和国参加，才能算是名符其实，否则，便只是美帝国主义的工具，等于宣布了自己的死亡。
    在安理会上反对苏联建议的，不仅有美国政府和法国政府的代表，而且有最近已经宣布愿与中华人民共和国建立外交关系的英国与挪威两国政府的代表。这是极其令人不解的。他们采取两面手段，用弃权的方式实际上支持美国反对中国人民行使合法权利，这种行动，不能不被认为对新中国人民的不友好行为。
    没有苏联代表团参加，没有新中国代表团参加，反而容忍一个鬼影的蒋廷黻代表团参加的安理会，中国人民认为这就是非法的，它所讨论的一切问题，与所做出的一切决议都是无效的，都是对中国人民和全世界正义的人民怀有敌意的，中国人民一定要反对到底。
