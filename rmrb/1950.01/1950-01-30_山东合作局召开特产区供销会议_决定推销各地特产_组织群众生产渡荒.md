    Shandong Cooperative Bureau Holds Special Product Supply and Marketing Conference; Decides to Promote Local Special Products and Organize the Masses to Produce to Overcome the Famine

    [Reported by this newspaper] The Shandong Provincial Cooperative Bureau convened a supply and marketing conference for the provincial-level cooperative promotion general and branch offices in special product areas in early January to discuss how to enable cooperatives at all levels to fully assist the masses in disaster areas to overcome the famine. In addition to reviewing the deviations in the supply and marketing work in 1949 and reporting on the quantity and sales of special products in each region, the conference focused on studying the guidelines, tasks, and business methods of the cooperative and cooperative promotion offices at all levels for this spring's supply and marketing work; and decided that each office should quickly formulate a plan for this spring's supply and marketing work. Regarding the guidelines for this spring's supply and marketing work, it was determined that the focus of supply and marketing for cooperatives and cooperative promotion offices throughout the province should be on disaster areas. According to the different regions and sideline special products, a certain amount of capital should be invested according to the specific situation, and the sales of finished products and the supply of raw materials should be guaranteed, so as to assist the state-owned trade departments in selling all the special products produced in the province in a planned and step-by-step manner, in exchange for raw materials and living materials for the masses' production, so as to help the masses produce for self-salvation and successfully overcome the famine.

    In terms of business methods, it was decided that the focus of capital utilization this spring should be on sideline products and difficult-to-sell local products in disaster areas, and capital should be managed and used in a unified manner according to the special products of different regions.

    In terms of manpower allocation, the economic forces of all parties should be combined (such as combining with the operating forces of legitimate private merchants) to organize the masses to transport and sell goods on their own. Close ties should be established between the offices to establish a purchasing and sales network to purchase special and sideline products for external sales. In terms of purchasing and sales methods, high purchase prices and low selling prices should be implemented. The main purpose of this method is to stimulate the rapid development of the cooperative economy. Therefore, all offices should resolutely implement this method in purchasing and selling, especially in production and disaster relief work, strict differential treatment should be given to the organized labor masses (including cooperative members, joint transportation teams, sideline product groups, etc.) and the unorganized masses to encourage organization.

    山东合作局召开特产区供销会议
    决定推销各地特产
    组织群众生产渡荒
    【本报讯】山东省合作局于一月上旬召开全省各特产区合作推进总分社供销会议，研讨如何使各级推进社全力协助灾区群众渡过灾荒。会议上除检讨一九四九年供销工作中的偏向及汇报各该区特产数量和推销情况外，着重研究合作社及各级合作推进社今春供销工作的方针、任务及经营方法；并决定各社迅速作出今春供销工作计划。关于今春供销工作方针，确定全省合作社、合作推进社供销重点应放在灾区，根据不同地区及副业特产，分别情形投入一定资金，并保证推销成品和供给原料，达到将本省所产特产有计划有步骤地协助国营贸易部门全部推销，换回群众生产原料、生活资料，以扶助群众生产自救，胜利渡过灾荒。
    在经营方法上决定：今春资金运用重点，放在灾区副业产品和不易推销的土产上，根据不同地区之特产，统一管理运用资金。
    在力量配备上，则结合各方面的经济力量（如和正当私商的经营力量结合），组织群众自行运销。社与社之间则密切结合建立购销网。收购特产、副产品向外推销。在购销办法上，则实行高收低售。这个办法主要目的，是为了刺激合作经济的迅速发展，因此各社在收购及抛售中都应坚决执行，特别是在生产救灾工作中对已组织的劳动群众（包括合作社员、联运组、副业组等）应严格与未组织的群众享受不同待遇，以鼓励组织起来。
