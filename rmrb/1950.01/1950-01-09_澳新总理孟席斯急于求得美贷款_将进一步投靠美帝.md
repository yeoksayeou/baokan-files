Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th—The newly formed Liberal Party-Country Party coalition cabinet of Australia will further rely on US imperialism politically and economically. Menzies, the new Prime Minister who publicly praised Hitler and Mussolini before the war, said when he met with reporters on December 21st of last year: "In all matters concerning our political, financial, and general economic problems, the government will welcome consultations with the highest US authorities at any time." (United Press) According to a report by the Denstu News Agency: In order to save its dollar shortage, the Menzies government will consider accepting the conditions proposed by the United States in order to obtain US loans. These conditions were so harsh that the previous Australian Labor government dared not consider them. Menzies has appointed Spender, a director of the US Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, as Foreign Minister, which shows Menzies' eagerness to obtain US loans. It is expected that the United States will also be "invited" to use Manus Island in Australia as a military base.

    澳新总理孟席斯
    急于求得美贷款
    将进一步投靠美帝
    【新华社北京八日电】澳大利亚新上台的自由党乡村党联合内阁，将在政治上、经济上进一步投靠美国帝国主义。战前曾公开赞扬过希特勒和墨索里尼的新总理孟席斯，在去年十二月二十一日接见记者时说：“在一切有关我们政治，财政及一般经济的问题上，政府将随时欢迎与美国最高当局磋商。”（合众社）据电通社消息：孟席斯政府为了挽救其美元匮乏，将考虑接受美国提出的条件，以获取美国贷款，这些条件的苛刻，曾使澳大利亚前任工党政府不敢考虑。孟席斯已任命美国固特异轮船公司的董事斯宾德为外长，这说明孟席斯之急于求得美国贷款。预料美国还将被“邀请”利用澳大利亚的曼纳斯岛作军事基地。
