    Massively Cultivating Industrial Construction Talent
    Dalian Establishes Industrial School
    [Report from our Northeast correspondent] To meet the needs of construction, the Dalian Industrial School has been established and will begin enrolling new students soon. The school's mission is to cultivate technicians, master technicians, engineers, and other various industrial construction talents. The highest level courses connect with the undergraduate courses of Dalian University, while the lowest level courses connect with the courses of the technical schools and training classes attached to various enterprises. The school has five departments: mechanical, chemical, electrical, civil engineering, and worker preparatory. Except for the worker preparatory department, the courses of the other four departments are equivalent to the high school level, and junior high school graduates of both sexes can apply for admission. The establishment of the worker preparatory department is to take care of the children of workers and cadres in the industrial sector. The plan is to reach the equivalent of junior high school level within two years, and then, based on academic performance, be assigned to undergraduate studies for further education. In order to adapt to long-term economic construction and run a standardized industrial school well, the undergraduate study time is set at three years, and the worker preparatory department's study time is set at two to five years. The learning method strives to combine technical theory with practice, and according to the instructions of the Lüda Administrative Office, the school will be closely integrated with the Dalian Industrial Museum. The school's principal also serves as the curator of the Industrial Museum. When the museum is open, students are the museum's guides, and when the museum is closed, it becomes the best practice site for the industrial school. The issue of teaching staff has now been resolved, with more than forty industrial technology experts from Shanghai serving as professors at the school.

    【本报东北讯】适应建设需要的大连工业学校已经成立，日内即招收新生。该校任务是培养技工、技师、工程师以及其他各种工业建设人材。最高课程与大连大学本科的课程相衔接，最低课程则与各企业单位附设的技术学校及训练班的课程相衔接。该校共设机械、化学、电气、土木、工人准备五科，除工人准备科外，其余四科的课程等于高中程度，初中男女青年均可报名投考。工人准备科的设立，系为了照顾工人的子弟及工业部门的干部，计划在二年内达到相当于初中的程度，之后，根据学习成绩，编入本科继续深造。为达到适应长期经济建设，办好正规化的工业学校，本科学习时间订为三年，工人准备科的学习时间订为两年到五年。学习方法力求技术理论与实际结合，并按照旅大行署指示，使该校与大连工业博物馆密切结合，该校校长兼任工业博物馆馆长，开馆时间学生即是博物馆的说明人员，闭馆时期该馆即成为工业学校学习上的最好实习场所。师资问题现已获得解决，将有上海的四十名以上的工业技术专家担任该校教授。
