Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 22nd: The People's Liberation Army Railway Engineering Corps has been repairing railways alongside the army for the past year and a half, from the Changbai Mountains in the north to the Pearl River in the south, ensuring the rapid advance of the Liberation Army and completing arduous railway repair projects. As of the end of last year, in addition to patching up existing lines, it had repaired 1,643 kilometers of lines, 989 bridges and culverts, and 2,116 kilometers of telecommunications lines that had been thoroughly destroyed by the enemy. This included the most difficult repair work on major trunk lines such as Jing-Shan, Jin-Pu, Long-Hai, Yue-Han, Xiang-Gui, and Tong-Pu railways, making significant contributions to the victories of the Beijing-Tianjin, Yangtze River Crossing, Central China, and South China campaigns, as well as the liberation of South, Northwest, and Southwest China, and playing an important role in economic recovery.

In completing these arduous tasks, all technical personnel, commanders, and combatants of the Railway Engineering Corps demonstrated a high degree of initiative and labor enthusiasm, using their intelligence to overcome difficulties. The First Detachment completed the repair of the Long-Hai Railway 20 days ahead of schedule, overcoming the difficulty of scaling the highest bridge in the country, producing nineteen high-altitude heroes led by Yang Lian'di and Zhao Shiquan, as well as cave blasting experts. The Second Detachment overcame the difficulties of acclimatization on the Yue-Han Railway, collected materials locally, and created a record of building 45 meters of bridge in one day and driving 86 piles in 24 hours, allowing the Yue-Han Railway to be fully opened to traffic in less than a month. The Third Detachment, with its heroic fighting spirit, repaired the Huai River Bridge on the Jin-Pu Railway a month ahead of schedule, allowing direct trains from Beijing to Shanghai, which had been suspended for twelve years, to run smoothly. The Xiangjiang Bridge on the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, which the Kuomintang reactionaries had failed to repair for four years, was repaired by the Third Detachment and the Hengyang Railway Bureau repair team in just one month, despite rising water levels. The Ironclad Brigade of the First Engineering Division of the Fourth Detachment implemented a torchlight assault method during the joint repair of the Jing-Han Railway, working around the clock, finally overcoming the difficulties of soft roadbeds and numerous bridges, and completing the full repair of the Jing-Han line 19 days ahead of schedule. The Railway Engineering Corps, originally the Northeast Field Army Railway Column, was established in July 1948 and renamed the People's Liberation Army Railway Engineering Corps in April of last year.

    铁道兵团一年半来成绩辉煌
    修复铁路千六百余公里
    对解放战争与经济恢复作了重大贡献
    【新华社北京二十二日电】人民解放军铁道兵团，一年半来随军抢修铁路，北自长白山南达珠江，保证了解放大军的迅速进军，完成了铁路修复中的艰巨工程。截至去年年底为止，除补修路线外，修复了被敌人彻底破坏的线路一千六百四十三公里，桥梁、涵洞九百八十九座，电讯线路二千一百一十六公里。包括京山、津浦、陇海、粤汉、湘桂、同蒲等干线中绝大部分最艰巨的抢修工程，对京津、渡江、华中、华南等战役的胜利，以及华南、西北和西南的解放作了重大的贡献，在恢复经济上也具有重要的意义。
    在完成这些艰巨的任务中，铁道兵团全体技术人员、指挥员和战斗员们，都发挥了高度的积极性和劳动热情，运用智慧，克服了困难。第一支队提前二十天完成陇海路的抢修工程，克服了全国最高桥梁的登高困难，出现了以杨连第、赵世全为首的十九名登高英雄和洞内爆破能手。第二支队在粤汉路上克服了水土不服的困难，就地搜集材料，并且创造了一天修桥四十五公尺，一昼夜打桩八十六根的记录，使粤汉路施工时间不到一个月就全线通车。第三支队以英勇的战斗精神，提前一个月修通津浦路的淮河大桥，使十二年未曾通车的北京至上海直达车畅通。湘桂黔路湘江大桥，国民党反动派四年未曾修通，而第三支队和衡阳铁路局抢修队在涨水情况下，一个月内就把它修好了。第四支队第一工程处铁甲总队在协力抢修京汉路中，实行火把突击办法，连夜赶修，终于克服路基松软和桥梁多的困难，提前十九天完成京汉全线修通任务。按铁道兵团原为东北野战军铁道纵队，于一九四八年七月成立，去年四月改为人民解放军铁道兵团。
