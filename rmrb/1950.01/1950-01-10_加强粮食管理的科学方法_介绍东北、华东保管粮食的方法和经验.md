    Strengthening Scientific Methods of Grain Management
    Introducing Grain Storage Methods and Experiences from Northeast and East China
    Jin Yu
    Grain management was one of the focal points of discussion at the First National Grain Conference. Due to insufficient attention paid to grain storage work by leaders in some regions, coupled with objective limitations, some grain suffered damage. In supporting the Liberation War and the increasingly developing economic construction, especially after many regions suffered severe disasters last year, preserving grain without causing any loss to national wealth is undoubtedly the most important task for party and government leading organs and national grain workers. Therefore, grain management, especially the specific storage of grain, has aroused universal attention from representatives of various regions at this conference. There was unanimous agreement that grain storage work should be given attention in all regions, all difficulties must be overcome, grain losses should be reduced, conditions should be created to apply scientific methods of grain storage in a planned way, and this should be the direction of our future efforts.

    Due to the different times of the end of the war in various regions and other objective conditions, the progress of grain work is also inconsistent. Some regions still use outdated storage methods, but Northeast and East China have begun to embark on the path of scientific management. The reason why these two regions have achieved better results is, on the one hand, that the objective conditions are relatively superior, and on the other hand, the leadership has paid great attention to grain storage work. Therefore, they have considerable achievements in pest control and prevention of heat and moisture.

    The Northeast has always attached importance to grain management work, vigorously adjusted cadres, and established various storage systems.
    The Northeast region has always attached importance to grain management work. Ideologically, they have proposed that grain is the main source of national wealth. To strengthen this work, they have vigorously adjusted grain work cadres. Organizationally, various systems have been established, such as: (1) Receiving system. Including receiving procedures, grain inspection standards, grading reception and grading into warehouses, etc. (2) Storage system. Including fire prevention, anti-theft, anti-special agent systems, moisture testing, grain temperature inspection systems, as well as regular plans, summaries, reports, commendation and model award, equipment storage, training of storage cadres and other systems. Among them, "commendation and model award" plays a great role in grain storage. The Northeast Grain Management Bureau once pointed out: "The warehouse model worker movement is an important weapon to strengthen warehouse work and grain storage."
    Strengthening the professional learning of grain management cadres
    In order to strengthen the professional learning of grain management cadres, the Northeast Grain Management Bureau has printed many booklets on the study of food storage, such as "Preliminary Research on Grain Temperature," "Grain Moisture Testing," and "Grain Physical Analysis." In addition, "Grain Work Newsletter" also regularly publishes research texts such as: research on the grain pest "Ouzi", research on storage business, and characteristics and processes of grain fever.
    Warehouses and related equipment are good conditions for grain storage. They have and will use these conditions. Many warehouses in Northeast China have grain handling machines (64 in total in Northeast China), drying machines (6), indoor thermometers, food temperature measuring instruments (i.e. thermal conductivity grain probes), and testing equipment (125). These modern devices play a great role in grain storage. According to the representative of the Northeast Grain Corporation attending the conference: a grain handling machine, with a large capacity, can handle an average of 400,000 catties of food grain per day, and a small one about 200,000 catties. Its advantage is that it can fan out impurities, volatilize moisture, uses less manpower, and achieves greater results. And in emergencies, there is no need to hire temporary workers. This machine is similar to a rural fan, installed in the warehouse, and is powered by electricity. Because of its great effectiveness, they are preparing to increase the number of such machines in large quantities. The capacity of the dryer is also very large, which can turn raw corn into semi-cooked corn. Although there is such equipment in the warehouse, it is not used unless necessary. The indoor thermometer and food temperature measuring instrument (thermal conductivity grain probe), the former is to check the temperature in the warehouse, and the latter is to check the grain temperature (ie the degree of fever). According to their experience: temperature inspection is one of the important measures for grain storage, in summer, it is checked daily or every other day, and there is a regular inspection system. In the summer of Northeast China, the grain temperature is gradually rising. As long as it does not rise sharply, there is no danger. According to the general situation, when the temperature rises above 28 to 30 degrees Celsius, attention should be paid to frequent inspections, and emergency disposal should be implemented when necessary.
    The basic reason for grain fever is excessive moisture
    The occurrence of grain temperature is closely related to the moisture content of the grain. According to Northeast China's experience, according to scientific standards, grain can only change under a certain moisture content and a certain temperature. Ordinary sorghum, millet, and soybeans contain moisture below 13% to 14%, and corn and rice contain moisture below 14% to 15%. No matter what season, generally, there is no change and no fever. After they found out that the basic reason for grain fever was excessive moisture, they vigorously paid attention to reducing grain moisture, and the methods are usually similar to those in various places, such as sun-drying and ventilation.

    According to the preliminary storage summary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Grain Bureau, this year, because there is a grain analyzer, the size of the moisture content of the grain can be tested at any time, so the change of the grain can be judged. Knowing the temperature of the grain with a thermometer can accurately grasp the change of the grain.
    Dry and wet grains must be stored separately
    According to their experience, grains entering the warehouse must be placed separately according to the degree of dryness and wetness. If they are all mixed together, not only will wet grains affect dry grains, but also it will cost more manpower and financial resources to stir. As for grains that have developed high fever or have begun to deteriorate, they should be disposed of in time, and never mixed with good grains. Grain that has developed high fever or is deteriorating is like yeast for winemaking, which is most likely to cause changes in good grain. They talked about such a story: a warehouse cadre was afraid of being criticized, so he mixed some deteriorated grain into the good grain in order to cover up, and as a result, all the grain was damaged. Regarding the control of insect pests, due to the severe cold climate in Northeast China, insect pests are relatively light. They only focus on thoroughly cleaning the warehouse and disinfecting with lime.

    The grain storage work in East China has also gained many good experiences, although the warehouse equipment is, to some extent, not as good as that in Northeast China. They proposed: to cherish and carefully store food grains, and absolutely not allow national assets to be lost, to achieve: "Do not spoil a grain of rice, do not waste a grain of grain." They said to the grain storage cadres: "Spoiling grain is an unforgivable crime." East China has various systems in the organization of grain work similar to those in Northeast China. Each county formulates warehouse management rules and typical investigations according to different situations.

    Because of the warm climate and serious insect pests in East China, special attention is paid to pest control. According to Liang Zhuhang, Director of the East China Grain Administration Bureau, before East China implemented scientific management and vigorously controlled insect pests, grain losses were considerable. After improving storage methods, the loss rate was greatly reduced.
    East China attaches importance to pest control and reduces losses
    The organization of grain storage in East China is like this: The East China Grain Management Bureau has a storage section, under which there are: grain insect control, inspection, and warehouse engineering groups. The grain insect control group currently has five or six technicians, who are dedicated to researching and guiding the prevention and control of grain insects. And it is planned to establish a fifty-person prevention and control team in 1950. The inspection team is responsible for checking the temperature and moisture of food grains and doing necessary tests. The warehouse engineering team plans and guides how to carry out construction projects.

    They have a set of scientific methods for preventing and controlling grain insects. According to their experience, fumigation with chemicals is the most effective way to kill grain insects, and the mortality rate can reach more than 99%. The second is spraying insecticides, and the mortality rate is also about 90%. The chemicals used: fumigation is using sodium cyanide and concentrated sulfuric acid (technical guidance is required) and sulfur. Spraying uses 5% "666 powder", wettable DDT, and green cross insecticide, etc. According to their statistics, the effectiveness of using the above-mentioned agents for prevention and control is very great. Rice can save nearly a quarter of the loss, and barley can save about one-tenth of the loss. The cost of prevention and control is generally very low, averaging about 13 cents per catty of grain. Fumigation is carried out when a large number of insect pests are found in the warehouse, and the implementation requires: chemicals, technology, and good warehouse conditions. Spraying insecticides is mostly used before or after grain enters or leaves the warehouse, spraying warehouses and sacks. Because the spraying method is easier to carry out, it is widely used, and they currently have 2,000 sprayers. In the entire pest control work, they have also received a lot of help from the pharmaceutical and technical personnel of the agricultural and forestry departments.

    In addition to pest control, East China also has unique features in equipment. According to Director Liang of East China: "In East China, regardless of the quality of the warehouse, there are facilities for bed frames to ventilate and prevent moisture. Otherwise, on the first floor near the ground, half of the sack will rot, and the grain will be moldy for at least an inch." According to their experience, attention should be paid to vertical and horizontal ventilation when stacking sacks. The ventilation windows of the warehouse should be installed alternately up and down. Ventilation time: generally, the climate should be from after 1:00 am to before 8:00 am the next morning. In addition, there are some experiences in renovating warehouses: the renovation of warehouses should pay attention to preventing birds, mice, water, fire, and heat. In terms of bird prevention, iron wire mesh has been installed in all ventilation places. In order to prevent heat, when building or renovating warehouses, the area on the sunny side should be reduced as much as possible, and sandwich walls should be installed. The roof needs to be thickened or a layer of ceiling should be added, which will play a role in preventing heat.

    加强粮食管理的科学方法
    介绍东北、华东保管粮食的方法和经验
    靳羽
    全国第一届粮食会议中，粮食的管理问题是讨论的重心之一。由于若干地区领导上对粮食保管工作重视不够，再加上客观条件的限制，致使粮食遭到若干损坏。在支援解放战争和正在日益发展的经济建设事业上，特别是在去年许多地区遭受严重灾荒之后，保管粮食不使国家财富受到丝毫损失，无疑的是党政领导机关以及全国粮食工作者第一等重要的任务。因而粮食的管理特别是粮食的具体保管，在此次会议上引起各地区代表普遍的重视。一致认为粮食的保管工作应引起各地的重视，必须克服一切困难，减少粮食的伤耗，争取条件作到有计划地运用粮食保管的科学方法，并作为我们今后努力的方向。
    由于各区战争结束的迟早及其他客观条件不同，粮食工作的进展也不一致。有些地区仍沿用陈旧的保管方法，但如东北、华东则已开始走上科学化管理的途径。这两个地区所以能够获得较好的成绩，一方面固然是由于客观条件比较优越，另一方面则是领导上对粮食保管工作给以极大的注意，因此，他们在防治虫害及防热、防潮等工作上，均有相当的成就。
    东北一向重视粮食管理工作，大力调整干部，建立各种保管制度
    东北区的粮食管理工作，一向是被重视的。在思想领导上，他们曾提出粮食是国家的主要财源。为加强这一工作，大力调整了粮食工作干部。在组织上建立了各种制度，如：（一）接收制度。包括接收手续，粮食检查标准，分等接收和分等入仓等。（二）保管制度。包括防火、防盗、防特制度，水份化验、粮温检查制度，以及定期计划、总结、报告、评功奖模、器材保管、训练保管干部等制度。其中“评功奖模”对粮食保管上起的作用很大。东北粮食管理总局曾指出：“仓库功模运动是加强仓库工作，加强粮食保管的重要武器。”
            加强粮食管理干部的业务学习
    为了加强粮食管理干部的业务学习，东北粮食管理总局印行了许多关于研究保管食粮的小册子，如：“粮食品温初步研究”、“粮食水份化验”、“粮食理学分析”等。此外在“粮食工作通讯”中也经常载有：粮食害虫“欧子”的研究，保管业务研究，粮食发热时之特征与发热过程等研究性文字。
    仓库和有关设备，是保管粮食的良好条件。他们拥有并且会使用这些条件。东北许多仓库中均有倒仓机（全东北有六十四台）、干燥机（有六台）、室内温度计、食粮检温计（即导热粮探）以及化验器（有一百二十五台）等设备。这些近代的装置对粮食保管是起着很大作用。据东北粮食总公司出席大会代表说：一个倒仓机，能力大的平均每天能倒动食粮四十万斤，小的约二十万斤。它的优点是能扇出杂质，挥发水份，用的人力少，收的效果大。并且在紧急情况中无须雇用临时工人。这种机器略似农村扇车，装置在仓库里，是用电力牵引。因为它的效用大，他们还准备大量的增加这种机器。干燥机的能力也很大，能把生玉米变成半熟。仓库中虽有这样的设备，但是非必要时不加使用。室内温度计和食粮检温计（导热粮探），前者是检查仓库内的温度，后者是检验粮温（即发热程度）。根据他们的经验：温度的检验是保管粮食重要措施之一，在夏季里是按日检查或隔日检查，规定有经常检查的制度。在东北的夏季里粮温是要逐渐上升的，只要不剧烈上升就无危险，按一般的情况温度上升到摄氏二十八度至三十度以上时，就要注意勤检，必要时实行紧急处置。
            粮食发热基本原因是水份过多
    至于粮温的发生是与粮食内含水份有密切的关系。据东北经验，按科学标准来说，粮食在一定水份，一定温度下才能发生变化。普通高粱、谷子、大豆含水份在百分之十三到十四以下，玉米、稻子含水份在百分之十四到十五以下，不管在什么季节里，一般不起什么变化，不会发热。他们找出粮食发热的基本原因是由于水份过多后，就大力注意减少粮食水份工作，其方法平常是用翻晒、出风等与各地情形相仿。
    据黑龙江省粮食局初步保管总结指出：由于今年有了粮食化验器，随时可以化验粮食所含水份大小，因而能判断粮食变化的情况。能够用检温计探知粮食的温度，可以确实掌握粮食的变化。
            干湿粮食必须分放
    另外据他们的经验：粮食入仓，必须根据干、湿程度分别放置，若一律混杂，不仅湿粮会影响干粮，同时捣翻时也要多费人力财力。至于已发高热或开始变质的粮食，应该及时处置，万勿与好粮混在一起。已发高热或正变质的粮食有如制酒的酵母菌，最易引起好粮的变化。他们谈到这样一个故事：有个仓库干部恐怕受批评，把一部变质的粮食掺混到好粮里面以图掩饰，结果使全部粮食遭到损坏。关于治除虫害，由于东北气候严寒，虫害较轻。他们则仅侧重彻底清扫仓库，用石灰进行消毒。
    华东区的粮食保管工作，由于仓库设备，在某种程度上说不如东北，但是也同样获得了许多较好的经验。他们提出：要爱护和慎重保管食粮，绝对不许使国家资财遭到损失，要做到：“不要坏一粒米，不浪费一粒粮。”他们对粮食保管干部提出：“霉坏粮食是不可原谅的罪恶行为。”华东区在粮食工作组织上具有与东北差不多的各种制度。各县根据不同情况制定仓库管理规则及典型调查等。
    华东区由于气候温暖，虫害严重，所以对防治虫害特别注意。据华东粮食管理局梁竹航局长谈：华东未实施科学管理大力防治虫害之前，粮食损耗不少，经过改进保管方法后，损耗率即大大减低。
            华东重视防治虫害，减少损耗
    华东保管粮食的组织是这样的：华东粮食管理总局设有藏储科，科下有：仓虫防治、检验、仓库工程三个组。仓虫防治组现有五、六个技术人员，专任研究及指导防治仓虫。并准备在一九五○年建立一个五十人的防治队。检验组是担任检查食粮温度和水份并做必要的化验。仓库工程组是计划指导如何进行修建工程。
            防治虫害应当采用科学方法
    防治仓虫，他们有一套科学办法。据他们的经验：以药剂熏蒸来杀除仓虫效用最大，死虫率能达百分之九十九以上，其次是喷撒杀虫剂，死虫率也占百分之九十左右。所用的药剂：熏蒸是采用?酸钠与浓硫酸（需技术指导）及硫磺。喷撒是采用百分之五的“六六六粉”，可湿性ＤＤＴ、及绿十字杀虫水等。据其统计，采用上述药剂防治的成效很大，大米能挽救近四分之一的损失，大麦能挽救约十分之一的损失。防治所需费用一般很低，平均每市斤粮食约一角三分。实施熏蒸是在仓库中发现大量虫害时，在实施中要具备：药品、技术、良好仓库三个条件。喷撒杀虫，多用于粮食入仓之前或出仓之后，对仓房和麻袋等施以喷撒。因为喷撒法较易进行，所以采用的普遍，目前他们有喷撒器达二千具。在整个防治虫害工作中，并得到农林部门的药械和技术人员不少帮助。
    华东区在防治虫害之外，在设备上也有独到之处。据华东梁局长说：“在华东不论仓库好坏，一律都有架床的设施，以通风和防潮。否则在接近地面的一层，麻袋要烂掉半面，粮食起码要霉坏一寸。”在垒放麻袋据他们的经验要注意纵横通风。仓库通风的窗子要上下交互装置。通风时间：一般气候要在夜里一时之后至次晨八时之前。此外在改建仓库方面也有一些经验：改建仓库要注意防雀、防鼠、防水、防火、防热等。在防雀上已做到凡通风处均装有铁丝网。为了防热，建筑或改建仓库时，在向阳一面尽量减少面积，并装建夹壁，屋顶需加厚或添装一层天花板，这样会起到防热的作用。
