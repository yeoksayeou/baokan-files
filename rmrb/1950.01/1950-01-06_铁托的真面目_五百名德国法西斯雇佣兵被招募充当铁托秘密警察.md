    Tito's True Colors
    Five Hundred German Fascist Mercenaries Recruited to Serve as Tito's Secret Police
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 5th] TASS reported on the 1st, citing a report from the Teletype Agency's Berlin correspondent: Yugoslav delegations in Frankfurt and Hamburg are currently recruiting former Nazi Stormtroopers and Hitler's army soldiers to serve as Yugoslavia's secret police. According to reliable sources, approximately five hundred German Fascist mercenaries are already serving Tito. A typical example of their activities in Yugoslavia can be illustrated by a letter from former Stormtrooper Deputy Captain Hans Detel to his girlfriend, Helga Siffel: "...I enjoy the work here. As I told you before, Yugoslavia is not a foreign country to me. Since 1944, very little has changed here. There are ten Germans in our team, but only three were not former Stormtroopers; they served in regular units. A few days ago, we were sent to the same village for the fourth time to instill some ideas into those stupid peasants..."
