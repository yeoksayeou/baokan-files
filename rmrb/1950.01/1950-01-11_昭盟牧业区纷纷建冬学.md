In the pastoral areas of Aohan Banner, Balinyou Banner, and Balinzuo Banner in Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, winter literacy classes have been established one after another this winter, with a large number of herdsmen participating in the study. For example, in Baiyinhua Nutuke Baiyin Aobao Airi (Editor's note: Banner, Nutuke, Airi are equivalent to county, district, and village) of Aohan Banner, among the 95 eligible male and female herdsmen, 62 have participated in winter school since November last year, studying Mongolian and Chinese. Winter schools for herdsmen have also been established in Lagacaihua Airi of Hanmiao Nutuke, Guluntala Airi of Daodemiao Nutuke, and Baqilouzi Nutuke. In Daru Sutubuleng Airi of Daban Nutuke in Balinyou Banner, four reading groups and five literacy groups have been established, with 136 people participating in the study. In Hagga Airi of Chagan Nuor Nutuke, all eligible herdsmen have participated in winter school, and some people who live three miles away from the school can arrive on time and are very enthusiastic about learning. In Taiping Airi of Soboligga Nutuke in Balinzuo Banner, nine herdsmen in their sixties have also participated in the study.
