Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 25th: Rural areas across North China are currently seizing the winter slack season to actively prepare for spring plowing. Regarding fertilizer accumulation, Shanxi Province has launched a mass fertilizer accumulation movement. According to incomplete statistics from 26 counties, including Jincheng in the province, over the past month and a half, a total of more than 95.4 million dan of fertilizer has been accumulated (of which, Huguan County has accumulated 70 dan per mu). Counties such as Changzhi have also adopted the method of chopping corn stalks, irrigating them with night soil, and then covering them with a layer of soil to allow the manure to thoroughly decompose, paying attention to improving the quality of the fertilizer. Many counties in Chahar Province have begun transporting manure to the fields and have also organized the transportation of large quantities of garbage and manure from cities such as Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Xuanhua to the countryside. Fertilizer accumulation work in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces is also actively underway. 562 villages in 5 districts including Handan in Hebei Province have accumulated more than 26 million dan of fertilizer; Tangyin, Wuzhi, Linxian and other three counties in Pingyuan Province have also accumulated more than 2.2 million dan. At the same time as accumulating fertilizer, various places are also actively repairing and building more farm tools. For example, Wuxiang County in Shanxi Province repaired and added more than 49,000 pieces in one month. Farm tool factories in Huguan and other places are also mass-producing various farm tools under government support to supply farmers. Chahar Province has manufactured 140,000 farm tools, and Pingyuan Province is working hard to complete the plan of "increasing farm tools by one million pieces." The repair and manufacturing of farm tools in Hebei Province is also being carried out universally. Other tasks such as adding draft animals and collecting firewood are also being carried out in many areas: many people in 16 counties including Yushe in Shanxi Province have prepared fuel for a year, and 25 counties including Xingxian had purchased more than 3,000 draft animals by the end of last year. Statistics from more than ten villages in Qi County, Pingyuan Province alone show that they have collected more than 6.7 million jin of firewood and grass. Hebei Province has adopted the method of collective raising of draft animals in disaster areas, and the general increase of livestock is being carried out in non-disaster areas. In addition, farmers in the sandy areas of Dongming and Puyang counties in Pingyuan Province are actively carrying out land turning and soil improvement work. The masses in Changzhi and other counties in Shanxi Province have built more than 38,000 earth banks. Wanquan County in Chahar Province is repairing the Second Canal, and the fifth district of the county is releasing frozen water to irrigate fields. Hebei Province is rushing to burn well bricks and manufacture waterwheels. The people of Xiong County and Ba County in Hebei Province are braving the severe cold to carry out the work of blocking the Daqing River, and Tianjin County is combining disaster relief with work-for-relief, mobilizing 3,000 disaster victims to drain water and remove land so that the flooded land can be sown in time. The cooperative in Tongxian Prefecture has stored more than one million jin of early-maturing crop seeds to actively prepare for spring plowing.

    华北各地农村抓紧冬闲空隙积极准备春耕
    【新华社北京二十五日电】华北各地农村现正抓紧冬闲空隙，积极准备春耕。在积肥工作上，山西省已展开了群众性的积肥运动，据该省晋城等二十六个县一个半月来的不完全统计，共积肥九千五百四十余万担（其中壶关县每亩已可上肥七十担），长治等县在积肥时并采取将玉蜀黍秆切碎，用圊粪灌过，再压一层土，使粪沤透的办法，注意提高肥料的质量。察哈尔省的许多县份，开始把粪送到地里，同时又组织了将张家口、大同、宣化等城市的大量垃圾粪便运至乡下。河北、平原两省的积肥工作也正在积极进行。河北省邯郸等五个专区五百六十二个村已经积了二千六百余万担肥料；平原省汤阴、武陟、林县等三个县也积了二百二十万担以上。与积肥同时，各地还纷纷进行修补和增造农具。如山西省武乡县一个月内即修理和增置四万九千余件，壶关等地的农具制造厂也在政府扶植下大量制造各种农具供应农民，察哈尔省已制造了十四万件农具，平原省正在为完成“增加农具百万件”的计划而努力，河北省的农具修制工作也在普遍进行。其他增添耕畜、打柴等工作也在许多地区展开：山西省榆社等十六个县的许多群众，都已经准备了一年的燃料，兴县等二十五县到去年年底止即已买了耕畜三千余头。平原省只淇县十余个村的统计即已打柴、割草六百七十余万斤。河北省在灾区采取伙养耕畜的办法，在非灾区则普遍进行增置牲口。此外，平原省东明、濮阳等县沙区农民，正在积极进行翻地和改良土质工作。山西省长治等县群众垒了地堰三万八千余道。察哈尔省万全县正在修整第二渠，该县五区并放冻水灌田。河北省正在赶烧井砖和赶制水车，该省雄县和霸县两县人民现正冒着严寒进行大清河堵口工作，天津县并结合救灾以工代赈，动员了三千灾民泄水脱地，使被水淹土地能及时播种。通县专区合作社储存了早熟作物种籽百余万斤，积极准备春耕。
