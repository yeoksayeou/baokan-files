    "Weak in Combativeness"
    Jin Jin
    After entering Revolutionary University, I served as a study committee member twice. Since I held a position, I constantly participated in work review meetings that were inseparable from the work. At each review meeting, I always made the following self-criticism: "My combativeness is very weak, and I cannot adhere to principles..." My understanding stopped at this limit, but what exactly is the problem with "weak combativeness"? What is the ideological root? I did not further analyze and criticize it.
    At first, I attributed it to a matter of face, because in my work style and handling of problems, I sometimes held the attitude of "everything can be discussed, why make things unpleasant," advocating "peaceful coexistence." In order to "seek perfection," I dared not face bad phenomena and could not adhere to the truth, leading to perfunctory and compromising behavior.
    Later, I attributed it to a superficial and vulgar understanding of the "mass line." On the issue of improving relations with the masses, I made the mistake of purely emotional solidarity, thinking that as long as the masses (whether progressive or backward) could "get along" with me, then I had improved relations with the masses. But the fact is often this: for any given task, the degree of reflection and support from the entire range of the masses is not necessarily the same. Since I had such a mindset, I showed hesitation and overthinking in my work, worrying about this and worrying about that, resulting in a failure to adhere to principles and carry out the work.
    The result of these self-criticisms still could not solve my ideological problem, because I did not raise it to the height of principle for criticism.
    Recently, I realized that this is actually a concrete manifestation of individualistic ideology in the work, that is, I have not established the concept of "wholeheartedly serving the people" in my own thinking. When considering issues, I first start from how my personal image in the masses will be, or from my own narrow interests. Naturally, it is impossible to correctly grasp the working principles that start from the highest interests of the masses. Taking the work of the study committee as an example, the problem becomes even simpler. To serve the students, you must naturally allocate a portion of your own time and energy to the work. Otherwise, how can you serve the masses? If you want to implement the arrangements of superiors and also suit your own convenience, you will naturally not be able to adhere to the system and cannot grasp it tightly. Therefore, the weakness of combativeness is precisely because of my weak sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause. Only by honestly standing on the position of the working people, only by being infinitely loyal to the cause of the working people, can we not be afraid of taking responsibility, not be afraid of offending people, and adhere to principles and adhere to the truth.
    Chairman Mao told us that a revolutionary cadre should be "active and willing to work, not for personal gain." Therefore, we should be politically open, actively create in our work, and overcome difficulties. Any manifestation of compromise, conciliation, or irresponsibility to the revolutionary cause that starts from the individual should be deeply examined and quickly overcome. Face the truth, adhere to the truth, and be a strong revolutionary fighter.

### “斗争性弱”

    “斗争性弱”
    金今
    进入革命大学，前后担任过两次学委；既然担任了工作，于是也就不断的参加与工作脱离不开的工作检讨会，而在每次检讨会上，我总是这样检讨：“我的斗争性很弱，不能坚持原则……”认识就停留在这样的限度上，但是“斗争性弱”究竟是个什么问题？思想根源是什么？却没有再进一步的分析与批判。
    起初我检讨，这是面子问题，因为自己在工作作风上以及处理问题上，有时的确是抱着“有事尽可商量，何必抓破脸皮”的态度的，讲究“和平共居”，而为了“求全”，于是便不敢正视坏的现象，不能坚持真理，敷衍，迁就的表现也就产生了。
    后来我又检讨，是对“群众路线”有着浮浅，庸俗的了解，对于搞好群众关系的问题上，犯了单纯感情团结的错误，以为群众“不论是进步的或落后的）都能和自己“合得来”便是搞好了群众关系，而事实往往是这样的，一个工作，对于全部范围的群众讲来，反映与拥护的程度未必是同一的，而自己既然有着这样的思想情况，于是在工作中便表现了束手束脚，顾虑这个又顾虑那个，结果不能坚持原则，不能开展工作。
    这样检讨的结果，还是不能解决我的思想问题，原因就是没有提高到原则高度来批判。
    最近我检讨的结果，才认识出，实际上这就是个人主义的思想意识在工作中的具体表现，也就是在自己思想上没有树立起“全心全意为人民服务”的观念来，考虑问题首先从个人在群众中的印象将是如何，或个人的、狭小的利益如何出发，自然就不可能正确的掌握从群众的最高利益出发的工作原则，拿学委的工作来说明，问题就更浅显了，为同学服务，自然要适当分出自己的一部分时间和精力放到工作中去，不然的话，你又怎样为群众服务呢？既想贯彻上级的布置，又想合乎自己的方便，自然不能坚持制度，不能抓的很紧，所以斗争性弱正是因为自己对革命事业的责任心薄弱的缘故，只有老老实实的站在劳动人民的立场上，只有对劳动人民的事业无限忠诚，才能不怕负责，不怕得罪人，才能坚持原则，坚持真理。
    毛主席告诉我们一个革命干部应该是“积极肯干，不为私利”，所以我们应当在政治上很开展，工作上积极创造，克服困难，任何从个人出发的委曲求全，调和折中对革命事业不负责任的表现，都应该深加检讨，迅速克服，面对真理，坚持真理，做一个坚强的革命战士。
    一九四九，十二，二六。
