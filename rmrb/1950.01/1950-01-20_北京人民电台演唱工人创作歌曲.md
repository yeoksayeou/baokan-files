    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Cadres from the Beijing Municipal Factory Literary and Art Work Committee were dispatched to twelve public and private factories in September of last year to assist worker comrades in promoting factory literary and art activities. Over the past four months, they have inspired workers to create various forms of literary and artistic works, including a total of forty-four songs. To exchange song creation experiences, the comrades from the committee stationed in the factories will jointly perform five of the better songs on the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station's employee program from 12:30 to 13:00 today. These include: "Good Brothers," a song about Sino-Soviet friendship from the Shijingshan Power Plant, and "Liberated Area Serenade," a song praising New China from the Qinghe Woolen Mill, and other songs, accompanied by an orchestra. After the performance, they will also introduce the song creation situation and experiences of twelve public and private factories in the capital over the past four months.
