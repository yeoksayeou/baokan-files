    Organize to Overcome Famine:
    Shandong Vigorously Engages in Disaster Relief Production
    Autumn plowing, replanting, and wild vegetable collection have yielded results; sideline production is now underway.
    [Our Dispatch] Disaster relief production is vigorously unfolding in Shandong. Shandong is one of the regions most severely affected by disasters in the country. The autumn harvest of food grains is insufficient to feed the entire province (even when including bran and vegetables) by six hundred million jin, and it is estimated that the number of famine victims will increase when the spring famine arrives. This is a rather serious problem. From spring to autumn, Shandong suffered continuous attacks from floods, droughts, insect plagues, and typhoons. As a result of the years of destruction and exploitation by the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, not only have such serious disasters been formed, but the excessive poverty of the masses has also made the disaster situation even more severe. Generally speaking, the disaster situation is lighter in the old areas, which also have a habit of self-reliance through production; the disaster situation is more serious in the new areas, and the general cadres are weaker, and the remnants of the feudal system and ideology have not yet been eliminated, which has added many difficulties to the disaster relief production work.

    After the famine began to take shape last year, the Shandong Sub-bureau of the Chinese Communist Party immediately called on party committees at all levels to make disaster relief production the center of their work. Under the leadership of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, starting in the autumn, the province extensively launched autumn plowing and wheat planting, replanting of late autumn crops and autumn vegetables, collection of wild vegetables and dried vegetables, and a variety of sideline production movements. The autumn planting area basically met the requirement of one-half of the plains and one-third of the mountains. The province planted a total of approximately 43 million mu of wheat, which played a significant role in ensuring people's lives and stabilizing the emotions of disaster victims. In terms of replanting late autumn crops and autumn vegetables, supply and marketing cooperatives played a significant role in supplying wheat seeds and vegetable seeds. In the Jiaodong area, the counties planted more than twice as many late autumn crops and autumn vegetables as in the previous year. In terms of collecting wild vegetables and drying vegetables, for example, in Hai'an County, in the Bohai area, only 7,228 people harvested more than 10,000 dan of wild grains. In Feixian County, in the Luzhongnan area, a total of more than 9.9 million jin of vegetables were stored, with a minimum of 10 jin per person. In the Jiaodong area, an average of 15 to 20 jin could be stored per person. Non-disaster areas also launched a widespread movement to dry wild vegetables and proactively assist disaster victims.

    As for sideline production, it has now become the central link in Shandong's disaster relief production work. In order to overcome the various difficulties in production, sales, and the disaster victims themselves, attention has been paid to strengthening the organization and planning of sideline production. For example, in Dongping County, households with boats and nets are organized to catch fish, households with labor but without tools are organized to carry fish to sell, and some people are organized to set up stalls and sell. In Feixian County, more than 20,000 disaster victims are organized to engage in production such as oil extraction, cotton ginning, spinning, weaving, and transportation, earning more than 784,000 jin of grain. According to a responsible person of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, the main problem in the province's disaster relief production at present is the sales of sideline products. If the province's mountain fruits, medicinal materials, weaving products, furs, and other sideline products can be sold out completely, they can be exchanged for 600 million to 1 billion jin of grain, which can maintain the lives of many disaster victims. In order to solve this problem, the province has drafted a plan for the transportation and sales of native products in the first half of this year. In addition to the large-scale purchase of sideline products by trading companies and cooperatives, sales agencies will be established in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and the Northeast, farmer reception centers will be established in major cities in the province, and the organization and leadership of cooperatives will be strengthened to resolve certain uncoordinated phenomena between trade departments and cooperative departments, and to replenish cooperative funds within the possible scope to solve sales problems.

    In addition, Shandong is also working on solving the following problems: First, it has been decided to establish and improve production disaster relief committees at all levels, with responsible cadres at all levels personally leading, to specifically grasp the disaster situation and promptly help lower levels and the masses solve various specific problems, in order to overcome the shortcomings of the past, where there were more general calls and less specific leadership in some places. Second, many district and village cadres have weaker abilities, especially in the new areas, and it is difficult to implement the disaster relief production policy in the villages. In order to solve this problem, in addition to strengthening the specific leadership of counties and districts, the study and training of district and village cadres has been specifically studied. In addition, the work of disaster relief production is strengthened through people's representative conferences and farmer representative conferences at all levels.

    组织起来战胜灾荒
    山东大力生产救灾
    秋耕、补种、采集野菜已获成绩；现正开展副业生产。
    【本报讯】生产救灾工作，正在山东大力展开。山东是全国受灾较重的地区之一。秋收食粮，供全省食用（连糠菜算入后）尚缺六亿斤，估计春荒来临时，饥民数目将会增加。这是一个相当严重的问题。山东自春至秋，即连续遭受水、旱、虫灾以及台风的侵袭，由于日寇、蒋匪连年破坏、榨取的结果，不但形成了这样严重的灾害，群众的过度贫困，也使灾情益形严重。各地受灾程度，一般说来，老区灾情较轻，且有生产自救习惯；新区灾情较重，而一般干部较弱，封建制度及思想的残余尚未消灭，这又使生产救灾工作增加了不少困难。
    去年灾荒开始形成后，中共山东分局即号召各级党委以生产救灾为工作中心。在山东省人民政府的领导下，从秋天开始，全省即广泛开展秋耕种麦，补种晚秋、秋菜，采集野菜晒干菜和多种多样的副业生产运动。秋种面积基本上作到了平原二分之一，山地三分之一的要求。全省种麦共约四千三百余万亩，对保障人民生活，安定灾民情绪作用极大。在补种晚秋和秋菜方面，供销合作社供给麦种、菜种，起了不小作用。胶东区各县种晚秋和秋菜，均超过前年一倍。在采集野菜、晒干菜方面，譬如渤海区海滨县，仅七千二百二十八人，即打野糁子一万多担。鲁中南区费县共积菜达九百九十余万斤，最少每人能积十斤。胶东区每人平均可积十五斤至二十斤。非灾区晒野菜也成为普遍运动，并主动救助灾民。
    至于副业生产，目前已成为山东生产救灾工作的中心一环。为了克服产、销和灾民本身的各种困难，已注意加强副业生产的组织性和计划性。例如东平县，组织有船有网的住户捕鱼，有劳力无工具的住户挑鱼卖，有人则守摊坐卖。又如费县灾民组织起来进行榨油、轧花、纺织、运输等生产的即达两万多人，已赚粮七十八万四千余斤。据山东省人民政府某负责人谈，目前该省生产救灾中的主要问题，即为副业产品的销路问题。该省山果、药材、编织、皮毛等副业产品，如能全部销出，即可换回粮食六亿到十亿斤，可维持很多灾民的生活。为解决这一问题，该省已草拟今年上半年的土产运销计划，除由贸易公司、合作社大量收购副业产品外，并将在上海、汉口、天津、东北等地设立推销机构，在省内各大城市设立农民招待所，及加强合作社的组织与领导，解决贸易部门和合作部门某些不协调现象，和在可能范围内充实合作社资金，以解决销路问题。
    此外，山东并正在着手解决以下几个问题：第一、决定建立与健全各级生产救灾委员会，由各级负责干部亲自领导，做到具体掌握灾情，及时帮助下级和群众解决各种具体问题，以克服过去某些地方一般号召多、具体领导少的缺点。第二、区村干部不少是能力较弱，特别在新区生产救灾政策很难贯彻到村。为了解决这一问题，除加强县区的具体领导外，已具体研究了区村干部的学习与训练问题。此外并通过各界人民代表会议及农民代表会议，来加强生产救灾工作。
