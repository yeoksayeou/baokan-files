    Broad Masses of Farmers Enthusiastically Pay Agricultural Tax; Chahar Province Overfulfills Autumn Grain Collection Quota; Adhering to the Mass Line, Fairly Assessing Production, and Rationally Distributing the Burden Are the Main Experiences in Exceeding the Task
    [Reported by this newspaper] The agricultural tax collection task for Chahar Province in 1949 was assigned in October last year at the provincial financial conference. Each county directly deployed the task to the villages in early November. By the end of December, the entire province had completed 101.85% of the task assigned by the Central People's Government. The speed of this public grain collection was unprecedented. In the distribution of public grain, appropriate reductions and exemptions were given to disaster-stricken households, and fair and reasonable distribution was achieved through mass discussions. Due to the importance attached by leaders at all levels and the enthusiastic payment by farmers, the quality of public grain was higher than in previous years. The quality of public grain collected in many areas exceeded that purchased by trade departments from the market, generally reaching the "dry, clean, new, and fine" standard required by the provincial government. The achievements mentioned above are due to:
    1. The victory of the national revolution greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the farmers, who consciously and enthusiastically paid public grain, and the grain quality was dry, clean, new, and fine. In many areas, the masses used quilts and trousers to transport grain due to a lack of sacks, and some used buckets to carry it. Many villages rushed to grind public grain day and night or borrowed winnowing machines from other villages. Many villages completed their public grain task within one day.
    2. Fair and reasonable distribution, achieving "three public announcements," was the key to quickly completing the task. The autumn grain distribution in the province last year was based on a general assessment of production. Because each village had already achieved a relatively fair assessment of land yields, coupled with the implementation of the mass line and the promotion of democracy in this collection, the distribution from village to household mostly achieved the three public announcements. After repeated discussions in various meetings, the masses felt satisfied and paid enthusiastically. For example, in Dongyuan Village, Yanggao, as soon as the task was assigned, the branch committee, branch general meeting, village cadre meeting, representative meeting, and mass meeting were held in succession to conduct repeated mobilization and democratic discussions, and the task was completed in two days.
    3. The leadership at all levels attached great importance to it. In order to complete the task quickly, each county directly deployed the task to the village and first solved the ideological problems of district and village cadres. For example, if they felt that the figures were large and the time was short, they used accounting methods to explain the favorable conditions for completing the collection to strengthen everyone's confidence, and then combined it with autumn plowing awards to arouse the enthusiasm of the cadres. Many districts and villages put forward challenges at that time, guaranteeing to complete the task ahead of schedule. Yanggao even combined it with the award movement to mobilize the masses to pay enthusiastically, and the entire county completed the task in thirteen days. Although Chahar North Special District was delayed in deployment due to the plague of rats, due to the leadership seizing the opportunity, it quickly shifted from emergency epidemic prevention to a concentrated assault on grain collection, and quickly achieved results.
            The Provincial Government's Leadership Grasped Tightly and Thoroughly Cleared Up Outstanding Debts
    In the provincial government's leadership, the collection work was also relatively tightly grasped, and instructions were timely. For example, at the end of the collection period, many cadres in various places had the idea of "almost finished" or "basically completed," thinking that it was enough to complete 80% or 90% and relaxed the clearing of remaining grain. The provincial government promptly issued instructions, pointing out the error of this idea, and strictly requiring all localities to quickly complete the entire task. Areas with outstanding debts reorganized their forces upon receiving instructions and thoroughly cleared up the outstanding debts.
            Grain Depot Cadres Cooperated in Inspection; the Quality of Grain Collected Was Universally Improved
    4. Reasonable consideration was given to disaster situations, families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed. On the issue of disaster reduction, due to the in-depth investigation and careful research at all levels, combined with democratic evaluation, the previous bias of affecting the completion of the task due to improper consideration and adjustment was overcome. The active cooperation of the grain department in the collection work was also a major feature. Due to the establishment and improvement of grain special management organizations at all levels, the organizational leadership of the collection was greatly strengthened. In the past, grain depot cadres often had the phenomenon of sitting and waiting to receive grain and not paying attention to checking grain quality; this autumn grain collection, grain depot cadres systematically cooperated with the collection work. In addition to actively checking grain quality and organizing collection and storage, many grain depot cadres also helped the masses solve the difficulties of food processing, such as organizing the use of windmills, which made the quality of grain collected universally improved compared to previous years.

### 广大农民踊跃交纳  察省秋征超额完成  走群众路线公平评产合理分配是超过任务主要经验

    广大农民踊跃交纳
    察省秋征超额完成
    走群众路线公平评产合理分配是超过任务主要经验
    【本报讯】察省一九四九年农业税征收任务，自去年十月省财政会议布置后，各县均于十一月初直接布置到村，至十二月底，全省完成中央人民政府所给任务的百分之一○一点八五。此次公粮征收之迅速，是以前所没有的。在公粮分配上，对受灾户均给以适当减免，并通过群众讨论，做到了公平合理。由于各级领导上的重视，和农民的踊跃交纳，公粮质量比往年都高，不少地区征收的公粮超过了贸易部门由市场购买的质量，一般达到了省府要求的“干、净、新、细”的标准。获得以上成绩，是由于：
    一、全国革命胜利形势大大鼓舞了农民的情绪，交纳公粮十分自觉踊跃，粮质干、净、新、细。不少地区群众因交粮口袋缺乏，用被子、裤子装送，有的用水桶担抬。很多村庄昼夜抢碾子碾公粮，或到外村借扇车、不少村庄一天内即完成公粮任务。
    二、分配公平合理，做到“三榜定案”，是迅速全部完成任务的关键。该省去年秋征分配是基于普遍评产的基础上的。由于各村对地亩产量已求得相当公平，加上此次征收贯彻了群众路线，发扬了民主，村对户的分配，大都做到了三榜定案，经过各种会议的反复讨论，群众感到满意，交纳踊跃。如阳高东园村，任务一布置下来，即接连召开了支委会、支部大会、村干会、代表会、群众大会，进行了反复动员和民主讨论，结果两天完成。
    三、各级领导上重视。各县为很快完成，都直接把任务布置到村，并先解决了区、村干部的思想问题。如觉得数字大、时间短，用算账办法说明完成征收的有利条件，来坚定大家信心，再结合秋耕评奖，鼓起了干部情绪。不少区、村当时提出挑战，保证提前完成。阳高更与评奖运动结合，发动了群众踊跃交纳，全县十三天就完成任务。察北专区虽因闹鼠疫布置迟了，但由于领导上抓紧时机，很快由紧急防疫转到突击征收，很快收到成绩。
            省府领导抓的紧彻底清理了尾欠
    在省府领导上，征收工作亦比较抓的紧，指示及时。如在征收结束时期，各地有不少干部存在着“差不多”、“基本上完成了”的思想，认为只要完成百分之八、九十就算完成了，放松了清理尾粮。省府及时发出指示，指出这种思想的错误，严格要求各地迅速全部完成。留有尾欠地区接到指示，又重新组织力量，彻底清理了尾欠。
            粮库干部配合检查  征收粮质普遍提高
    四、合理照顾了灾情及烈军工属、老弱孤寡等。在减灾问题上，由于各级的深入调查、细密研究，结合民主评议，克服了以往的由于照顾调剂不当而影响任务完成的偏向。粮食部门积极配合征收工作，也是一大特点。由于各级粮食专管机构的建立与健全，征收的组织领导力量便大大加强了。过去粮库干部常有坐待收粮、不注意检查粮质的现象；此次秋征粮库干部有计划地配合了征收工作。他们除了积极检查粮质，组织征收入库外，有许多粮库干部还帮助群众解决食粮加工的困难，如组织使用风车等，这就使得征收粮质比往年普遍提高。
