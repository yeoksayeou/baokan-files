    “Regrettable”
    ——Reading the Newspaper
    Yan Ling
    On the first day of the Soviet Far East Maritime Territory Military Tribunal's trial of Japanese germ warfare criminals, when Kiyoshi Kawashima confessed to his brutal crimes, he shamelessly said: They once tied fifteen people to iron posts on a target range, and then dropped ceramic bombs containing plague-infected fleas on the target range from an airplane; as a result, "Colonel Otani, who carried out this operation, found it regrettable that the people in this experiment did not die completely."
    When will the imperialist beasts be able to stop feeling "regret"? They are enemies of the Chinese, Soviet, and Mongolian people, enemies of all mankind. Unless they plunge all of humanity into catastrophe, kill large numbers of people, and trample the whole world under their hooves, they will always feel "regret."
    Even if the Japanese imperialists' germ weapon experiments had been very successful, they still would not be able to avoid feeling "regret." The nature of imperialism dictates that they will always "regret." Because the people of all countries will never be willing to be slaughtered and trampled on; because the existence of the world democratic camp, led by socialist Soviet Union, does not allow imperialists to run rampant and act recklessly in the world.
    The "Three Alls" policy ultimately failed to kill off or subjugate the Chinese people. Instead, the liberated areas grew larger and larger, and the anti-Japanese army grew stronger and stronger, until it was finally able to carry out a victorious counter-offensive. Could the Japanese invaders not "regret" this? After the Soviet army defeated fascist Germany, it sent troops to Manchuria, not only preventing the Japanese invaders from using germ weapons in their war of aggression, but also giving the Japanese Kwantung Army a fatal and devastating blow, forcing the Japanese invaders to surrender. Could the Japanese invaders not "regret" this? The people who manufactured germ weapons were finally subjected to a just trial and sentenced to imprisonment. Could they not "regret" this?
    All imperialists will forever live in "regret," and the increasingly large fruits of "regret" will be devoured by the instigators of new wars, until they are buried by their gravediggers—the progressive people of the world.

    “引为遗憾”
    ——读报随笔
    燕凌
    在苏联远东滨海军区军事法庭审讯日本细菌战犯的第一日，川岛清供认其残暴罪行时无耻地说：他们有一次把十五个人绑在靶场的铁柱上，然后从飞机上把装有鼠疫跳蚤的陶瓷炸弹投在靶场上；结果，“执行这件事情的大谷大佐对于这次实验中的人们没有完全死光，引为遗憾。”
    帝国主义野兽们什么时候能够不“遗憾”呢？它们与中国、苏联、蒙古人民为敌，与全人类为敌，不把全人类投入浩劫，不把大批的人杀死，不把全世界踩在它们的蹄子下面，它们将永远感到“遗憾”。
    即使日本帝国主义者的细菌武器的实验已经做得十分成功了，它们也仍将不能不“遗憾”。帝国主义的本质注定了它们必将永远“遗憾”。因为，各国人民是决不甘心被屠杀被践踏的；因为，有了以社会主义的苏联为首的世界民主阵营的存在，就更不容许帝国主义者在世界上横行霸道、胡作非为。
    “三光”政策终于未能使中国人民死光或屈服，解放区反而越来越扩大，抗日军队反而越来越强壮以至最后能进行胜利的大反攻，日寇能不为此“遗憾”吗？苏联军队打败了法西斯德国之后就出兵满洲，不但使日寇的细菌武器无法再使用于侵略战争，而且给予日寇关东军以致命的毁灭性的打击，迫使日寇不得不投降，日寇能不为此“遗憾”吗？制造细菌武器的人终于受了正义的审判，被判了徒刑，他们能不为此“遗憾”吗？
    一切帝国主义者必将永远在“遗憾”中过日子，越来越大的“遗憾”之果却将为新战争煽动者吞吃，直到它们被它们的掘墓者——世界进步人类所埋葬。
