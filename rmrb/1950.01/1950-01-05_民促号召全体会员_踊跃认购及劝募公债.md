    The NPC Calls on All Members to
    Actively Subscribe to and Solicit National Bonds
    [This newspaper reports] The China Association for Promoting Democracy today published an article entitled "Actively Subscribe to National Bonds," the full text of which is as follows:
    "The first issue of the 1950 People's Victory Indexed Bonds is being issued today, and this is a major event concerning the interests of the people of the whole country, and we should express our warm support.
    The government's reason for issuing this People's Victory Bond is to support the People's Liberation War to the end, to quickly liberate all of China, and economically, it is directly to make up for the fiscal deficit (but this deficit is productive, not consumerist), and indirectly to stabilize prices, so as to stabilize people's livelihoods and enable the economy to embark on the road of recovery and development.
    This People's Victory Indexed Bond adopts the indexed standard, the purpose of which is entirely to protect the interests of bondholders; indexed savings have been implemented in major cities for a year and have been trusted by the broad masses of the people, and the adoption of the indexed standard for bonds also meets the requirements of the masses. At the same time, this bond is a debt rather than a donation. It merely wants to freeze a part of the purchasing power and temporarily lend it to the government for use. For individuals, this purchasing power still exists. It is in the hands of the government, which reduces the deficit and reduces the currency issuance, and it is used in productive undertakings, which greatly plays the role of stabilizing prices and maintaining currency value. Therefore, people's purchase of bonds looks like a burden on the surface, but in reality, it is equivalent to saving a sum of money in the bank for a relatively long period of time, which does not cause any loss to the individual, but if everyone buys bonds, it will play a certain role in stabilizing prices and maintaining currency value for the whole country. Subscribing to national bonds is really a win-win situation.
    We call on all members of this association to actively subscribe to or solicit subscriptions and participate in the enthusiastic national bond subscription campaign across the country. We believe that all the people will complete this glorious task with enthusiasm."

### 民促号召全体会员  踊跃认购及劝募公债

    民促号召全体会员
    踊跃认购及劝募公债
    【本报讯】中国民主促进会今发表《踊跃认购公债》一文，全文如下：
    “一九五○年第一期人民胜利折实公债，于今天开始发行了，这是一件有关全国人民利益的重大事情，我们应该表示热烈拥护。
    政府所以要发行这次人民胜利公债，是为了支持人民解放战争进行到底，迅速解放全中国，在经济上，直接是为了弥补财政赤字（但这赤字是生产的，不是消费的），间接是为了平稳物价，以利安定民生，使经济走上恢复和发展的道路。
    这次人民胜利折实公债，采用折实标准，目的完全是保护公债持有人的利益；折实储蓄一年来在各大城市实行，已得到广大人民的信任，公债采用折实标准，也符合了群众的要求。同时，这次公债是债而不是捐，它无非是要冻结一部分购买力，使它暂时借给政府使用而已。对个人来讲，这份购买力还是存在的。它掌握在政府手中，乃使赤字减少，通货减发，又将它用之生产事业，却大大地发挥了稳定物价保持币值的作用。因此人民购买公债，表面上看起来是一种负担，实际上等于把一笔钱比较长期地储蓄在银行里，对个人没有什么损失，但是大家都购买公债，对整个国家来讲，在稳定物价保持币值上却起了一定的作用。认购公债真是一举二得的事。
    我们号召本会全体会员踊跃认购或劝募，参加国内各地如火如荼的认购公债运动。我们相信全人民一定会以热烈的心情来完成这光荣的任务的。”
