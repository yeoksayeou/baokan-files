Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: The current policy guidelines of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Committee, approved by the 14th Government Administration Council meeting, are as follows:

    The peaceful liberation of Xinjiang Province has fulfilled the long-cherished wish of the people of all ethnic groups. The task now is, under the leadership of the new national and democratic united provincial government, to resolutely implement the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and all policies and decrees of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, implement the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and uniting all democratic classes and nationalities, oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and strive to build a democratic, free, peaceful, united, prosperous, and happy New Xinjiang. To this end, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Committee, based on the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference and the situation in this province, hereby formulates the current policy guidelines for this province as follows:

            Ensure Peace, Consolidate Security, Military-Government Unity, Military-Civilian Unity

    1. Ensure peace in the province, consolidate social security, disband all secret service agencies and reactionary organizations, eliminate special agents, bandits, and hidden saboteurs of British and American imperialism, strictly prevent and suppress the conspiracies and sabotage activities of reactionary elements. Reactionary elements with heinous crimes must be punished in accordance with the will of the people, but those who are willing to repent and start anew should be given a path to self-renewal, and should not be killed or insulted.

    2. The Provincial People's Government and the People's Governments at all levels under its jurisdiction should lead the people to cherish their own army and promote the fine traditions and work style of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army must ensure that it resolutely and thoroughly implements all government decrees and protects the interests of the people in order to achieve unity between the military and the government, and unity between the military and the people; and it has the responsibility to assist the government in establishing the people's local armed forces and public security forces to maintain social order. All troops within Xinjiang must, in accordance with the instructions on army production issued by Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission on December 5, actively prepare for large-scale production, launch a large-scale production movement, and make the entire army a vital force for building a new Xinjiang.

            Equality, Unity and Mutual Assistance Among All Nationalities, Strengthen the People's Democratic United Front

    3. Resolutely implement the ethnic policies stipulated in the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference. All ethnic groups within Xinjiang are equal, practice unity and mutual assistance, oppose the people's enemies within each ethnic group, oppose Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism, and oppose Pan-Turkism advocated by British and American imperialism and their running dogs. All ethnic groups have the freedom to develop their languages and scripts, maintain and reform their customs and habits, and religious beliefs. All forms of discrimination, oppression, retaliation, vendettas, and acts of splitting the unity of all ethnic groups are prohibited. Cultivate and promote cadres from all ethnic groups, organize and educate the people of all ethnic groups.

    4. Establish and strengthen the people's democratic united front of all ethnic groups. In accordance with democratic principles, transform governments at all levels, abolish the Baojia system, eliminate reactionary elements, educate and transform old civil servants, and absorb advanced elements from all ethnic groups to participate in government work. Convene people's representative conferences of all ethnic groups and all sectors of society in the province, counties, and cities in a planned and step-by-step manner. Once land reform has been realized and people from all walks of life have been organized to a considerable extent, universal suffrage will be implemented in the province, counties, and cities to convene people's representative congresses of the province, counties, and cities. The government guarantees the people of all ethnic groups freedom of thought, speech, publication, assembly, association, etc. Women enjoy equal rights with men, and freedom of marriage is practiced. No government agency or religious organization may infringe upon these rights. Religion shall not interfere with judicial administration. The provincial government and all political organs of county and city governments under its leadership must practice a clean, simple, and revolutionary work style of serving the people, severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, and oppose the bureaucratic work style of being divorced from the masses.

            First Restore and Develop Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Handicraft Industries, Consolidate Finance, and Reduce the Burden on the Working People

    5. Xinjiang's economic construction: Must abide by the fundamental principles of the economic policy in the Common Program, that is, the policy of taking into consideration both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and internal and external exchanges, in order to achieve the goal of developing production and prospering the economy. The current specific guidelines: The first priority is to restore and develop agriculture, animal husbandry, and handicraft industries, and gradually develop industry, mining, and cooperatives, in order to promote the development of Xinjiang's social economy. Therefore, in agriculture: It is necessary to reclaim wasteland, increase grain production, restore and expand cotton fields, restore and develop sericulture, protect and cultivate forests, and especially vigorously build water conservancy projects. In animal husbandry: It is necessary to improve livestock breeds, encourage breeding, establish veterinary stations, and prevent animal diseases; gradually build modern pastures and stabilize the lives of herdsmen. In industry and mining: First, exploit petroleum and various metals, and build light industries such as textiles and leather. In order to stimulate the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and handicraft industries, it is necessary to sell surplus goods for export and exchange for necessities to meet the needs of the people. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly develop domestic and foreign trade, unify the currency system, stabilize finance, and establish provincial trading companies and branch companies in various regions to manage trade, regulate supply and demand, oppose profiteers manipulating and hoarding, and support cooperative undertakings in order to achieve the goal of developing production. In order to develop production and trade, it is also necessary to improve and develop various transportation undertakings.

            Mobilize the Masses and Gradually Implement Land Reform, Organize Workers, Peasants, Youth, Women and People's Organizations

    6. Consolidate finance, establish a budget, final accounts, and auditing system, consolidate taxation, implement reasonable burdens, increase government revenue, and reduce the burden on the poor working people.

    7. Land reform is a necessary condition for developing social productive forces and national industrialization. The peasant masses of Xinjiang are subjected to deep and cruel feudal exploitation and oppression. Only by resolutely implementing the land reform policy can the vast peasant masses of all ethnic groups obtain true liberation, and only then can backward agricultural and pastoral Xinjiang be transformed into advanced industrial Xinjiang. However, to implement land reform, it is necessary to mobilize the masses, go through steps such as eliminating bandits and special agents, opposing local bullies, and implementing rent reduction and interest reduction, to achieve the goal of tillers having their land and rationally distributing water conservancy.

    8. Mobilize and organize workers, peasants, youth, women and other people's organizations, and make them a strong and reliable pillar of the government's various construction projects.

            Promote National Culture and Reform the Education System, Consolidate and Develop Friendly Relations Between China and the Soviet Union and China and Mongolia

    9. Implement new democratic scientific and cultural education, promote the cultures and art forms of all ethnic groups, reform the education system, cultivate cadres, popularize national education, improve social education, develop medical and health care, and eradicate social evils such as opium, gambling, and other social vices. Advocate national virtues such as love for the motherland, love for the people, love for labor, love for science, and care for public property.

    10. Consolidate and develop the permanent friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, and obtain Soviet assistance for various construction undertakings in Xinjiang. Promote cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union's ethnic policies, and learn from the Soviet Union's experience in building the country; at the same time, develop friendly relations and cultural exchanges between Xinjiang and the Mongolian People's Republic, and build a new Xinjiang.

    团结各民主阶级和各民族
    为建设新新疆而奋斗
    政务会议批准新疆省施政方针
    【新华社北京八日电】政务院第十四次政务会议批准的新疆省人民政府委员会目前施政方针，全文如下：
    新疆全省和平解放，各族人民多年来的愿望已经实现。今后的任务是在新的民族民主的联合的省政府领导下，坚决实行中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领及中华人民共和国中央人民政府一切政策法令，实行工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的，团结各民主阶级和各民族的人民民主专政，反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，为建设民主、自由、和平、团结、繁荣和幸福的新新疆而奋斗。为此，新疆省人民政府委员会，根据人民政协的共同纲领和本省情况，特制定本省目前施政方针如下：
            确保和平巩固治安  军政团结军民团结
    一、确保本省和平，巩固社会治安，解散一切特务机关与反动组织，肃清特务土匪及英美帝国主义暗藏的破坏分子，严防并镇压反动分子的阴谋和破坏活动。罪大恶极的反动分子，必须依照人民意志予以惩处，但对于一切愿意痛改前非的人，则给予自新之路，不得杀害和侮辱。
    二、省人民政府及所辖各级人民政府，领导人民爱护自己的军队，宣扬中国人民解放军的优良传统作风。人民解放军确实保证坚决彻底执行政府的一切法令，爱护人民利益，以达到军政团结，军民团结；并有责任协助政府建立人民的地方武装及公安部队，维持社会秩序。新疆境内所有军队必须根据人民革命军事委员会毛泽东主席十二月五日颁发的关于军队生产的指示，积极进行大生产的准备工作，发动大生产运动，使全军成为建设新新疆的劳动的生力军。
            各民族间平等团结互助  加强人民民主统一战线
    三、坚决执行人民政协共同纲领中所规定的民族政策。新疆境内各民族一律平等，实行团结互助，反对各民族内部的人民公敌，反对大民族主义和狭隘的民族主义，反对英美帝国主义及其走狗所倡导的大土耳其主义。各民族均有发展其语言文字、保持并改革其风俗习惯及宗教信仰的自由。禁止一切民族间的歧视、压迫、报复、仇杀和分裂各民族团结的行为。培养和提拔各民族中的干部，组织和教育各民族的人民。
    四、建立并加强各族人民民主统一战线。依照民主原则，改造各级政权，废除保甲制度，清除反动分子，教育和改造旧公务人员，吸收各民族中的先进分子参加政府工作。有计划的有步骤的召集省、县、市的各族各界的人民代表会议。在土地改革一经实现，各界人民已有相当普遍组织时，即在省、县、市实行普选，召开省、县、市的人民代表大会。政府保证各族人民思想、言论、出版、集会、结社等自由。妇女与男子享有平等的权利，实行婚姻自由。任何政府机关、宗教团体均不得侵犯上项权利。宗教不得干涉司法行政。省政府及其领导的县市一切政权机关，必须励行廉洁的、朴素的、为人民服务的革命工作作风，严惩贪污，禁止浪费，反对脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风。
            首先恢复发展农牧业手工业  整理财政减轻劳动人民负担
    五、新疆经济建设：必须遵守共同纲领中经济政策的根本方针，即以公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流的政策，达到发展生产繁荣经济之目的。目前的具体方针：首先是恢复与发展农业、牧畜业、手工业，并逐渐发展工矿业及合作社，以便推进新疆社会经济的发展。因此在农业方面：必须开垦荒地、增产粮食，恢复和扩大棉田，恢复和发展桑蚕，保护和培植森林，尤其应当大力兴修水利。在牧畜业方面：必须改良畜种，奖励增殖，设立兽医站，防止兽疫；逐渐建设近代牧场，固定牧民生活。工矿业方面：首先开采石油及各种金属和建设纺织皮革等轻工业。为了刺激农牧业及手工业的发展，就必须推销剩余物品出口，换回必需品，以供人民的需要。因此须迅速开展对内对外的通商贸易，统一币制，稳定金融，成立全省贸易公司与各区的分公司，管理贸易，调剂供求，反对奸商操纵居奇，扶助合作事业，以达到发展生产之目的。为着发展生产与贸易，并须改进与发展各种交通运输事业。
            发动群众逐步实行土改  组织工农青妇人民团体
    六、整理财政，建立预算决算审计制度，整理税收，实行合理负担，增加政府的收入，减轻贫苦劳动人民的负担。
    七、土地改革为发展社会生产力和国家工业化的必要条件。新疆农民群众，受着深重而又残酷的封建剥削和压迫，只有坚决实行土地改革政策，才能使各族广大的农民群众获得真正的解放，才能使落后的农牧的新疆有条件变为先进的工业的新疆。但实行土地改革，必须发动群众，经过肃清土匪特务、反对恶霸、实行减租减息等步骤，达到耕者有其田，合理支配水利。
    八、发动与组织工人、农民、青年、妇女等各人民团体，并使之成为政府各项建设的有力的可靠的支柱。
            提倡民族文化改革教育制度  巩固发展中苏中蒙友好关系
    九、实行新民主主义的科学文化教育，提倡各民族的文化和艺术形式，改革教育制度，培养干部，普及国民教育，改进社会教育，发展医药卫生保健工作，根绝麻烟、鸦片与赌博等社会恶习。提倡爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物的国民公德。
    十、巩固和发展中苏永久的友好关系，取得苏联对新疆各项建设事业的帮助。促进中苏文化的交流，学习苏联的民族政策，学习苏联建国经验；同时开展新疆与蒙古人民共和国的友好关系及文化交流工作，建设新的新疆。
