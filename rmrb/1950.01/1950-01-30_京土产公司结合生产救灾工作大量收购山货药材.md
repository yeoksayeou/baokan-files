    [Beijing News] The Beijing Branch of the North China Native Produce Company is massively purchasing sideline products, mountain goods, and medicinal materials. The company was established in September of last year. From October to December, in three months, it purchased over 385,000 jin of peach kernels, over 89,000 jin of walnuts, over 145,000 jin of apricot kernels, over 70,000 jin of cellophane noodles, over 17,000 jin of peppercorns, and over 1,520,000 jin of medicinal materials (such as anemarrhena and bupleurum), with a total value equivalent to approximately 4,695,500 jin of millet. In addition, the company also played a considerable role in the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. For example, the Yi County branch exchanged 1,914 bolts of native cloth and other industrial products such as socks with cooperatives for mountain goods and medicinal materials. Farmers selling mountain goods and medicinal materials in Beijing also exchanged them for industrial products to take back to their villages. The company also cooperated with production and disaster relief, working with disaster area governments and cooperatives to organize disaster victims to dig and collect medicinal materials. For example, the mountain goods and medicinal materials purchased in the Four Seas County were worth a total of 1,737,700 jin of millet. Mountain porters also earned freight charges equivalent to over 50,000 jin of rice, and women and the elderly were also able to obtain processing fees equivalent to over 10,000 jin of millet.
