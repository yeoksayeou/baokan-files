    The Party's Task in the Southern Part
    Mobilize the People to Actively Support the Guerrillas; Strengthen the Unity and Struggle of the Working Class
    In the southern part, the Party should carry out extensive propaganda to mobilize the people to actively support the guerrillas, resolutely resist the Lee Seung-man bandit gang's forced conscription, grain requisition, exorbitant taxes, and atrocities such as using American and Japanese weapons to slaughter guerrillas. The Party should conduct propaganda among the soldiers of the puppet "National Defense Army," encouraging them to refuse to participate in the civil war of killing compatriots, break away from the counter-revolutionary armed forces, and join the people's guerrillas. We must strengthen the unity of the working class, further enhance its organizational strength, fighting power, and political consciousness, and improve their material lives. The Workers' Party is the core of the working class. It unites the trade unions, the Democratic Youth League, and the Women's League around it, becoming the leading force in economic and cultural construction. In South Korea, the only working-class party—our Workers' Party—and the main labor organizations have been driven underground, while the "Daehan Labor Union" is a tool of the Lee Seung-man clique and American imperialism. The Party should expose the reactionary nature of the "Daehan Labor Union," win over the working masses from the lower levels of its organization, and promote them from the struggle for economic interests and political rights to the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Kim Il-sung also pointed out: Our party must also strengthen its work among poor and middle peasants, who are the allies of the working class. Our party must step up the struggle against the Tito group, which has joined the imperialist and fascist camp. Kim Il-sung then demanded that the entire party must recognize that in the event of our party waging a resolute struggle against the reactionaries, the imperialists and their running dogs may try to get their agents and spies like Tito into our party. Among the Korean puppets, there are loyal agents of American imperialism and former agents of Japanese imperialism. Hidden American imperialist spies have used various means to try to undermine our country's cause of unification. Therefore, we must be more vigilant. Finally, he emphasized the need for the entire party to strengthen the ideological education of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. He said: Whoever is not armed with this kind of thinking is not and cannot be a true patriot. No narrow nationalism is allowed within the Party, and we must ideologically reject and fight against all forms of opportunism, sectarianism, and bourgeois nationalism. It is necessary to educate the entire Party and the entire people to recognize that only by strengthening friendship and unity with the great liberators and the people's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China can we achieve the victory of an independent, prosperous, and strong country, and consolidate this victory.

    党在南半部的任务
    动员人民积极支援游击队  加强工人阶级团结和斗争
    在南半部，党应广泛进行宣传，动员人民积极支援游击队，坚决反抗李承晚匪帮的强迫征兵、征粮、苛捐杂税及以美日武器来屠杀游击队等暴行。党应向伪“国防军”的士兵们进行宣传，鼓动他们拒绝参加屠杀同胞的内战，脱离反革命武装，参加人民游击队。应当加强工人阶级的团结，进一步提高它的组织力、战斗力和政治觉悟，改善他们的物质生活。劳动党是工人阶级的核心。它团结了职业同盟、民主青年同盟和妇女同盟在其周围，成为经济、文化各方面建设的领导力量。在南朝鲜，唯一的工人阶级的政党——我们的劳动党和主要的劳工组织，已被赶入地下，而“大韩劳动组合”乃是李承晚集团及美帝国主义的工具。党应揭露“大韩劳动组合”的反动本质，从其组织的下层，争取工人群众，推动他们由争取经济利益和政治权利的斗争而进到为争取祖国和平统一的斗争。金日成同时指出：我们党还必须加强在贫农与中农中间的工作，它们是工人阶级的同盟军，我们党必须加紧对铁托集团进行斗争，这个集团已经投入帝国主义和法西斯主义阵营。金日成接着要求全党必须承认：在我们的党对反动派进行坚决斗争的情况下，帝国主义及其走狗，可能设法使它们像铁托一样的代理人和间谍混进我们的党内来。在朝鲜傀儡中，有着美帝国主义的忠实代理人、日本帝国主义的旧代理人。暗藏的美帝国主义间谍，他们曾用种种手段，企图破坏我国的统一事业。因此，必须更加提高警惕。最后，他着重提出要全党加强马列主义及无产阶级国际主义的思想教育。他说：谁没有这种思想武装，谁就不是、也不可能是真正的爱国主义者。党内决不允许任何狭隘的民族主义存在，必须在思想上排斥并与各种机会主义、宗派主义和资产阶级的民族主义作斗争。必须教育全党和全体人民认识，只有在与伟大的解放者和以苏联为首的各人民民主国家以及中华人民共和国加强友爱团结的条件下，我们才能取得自主独立富强国家的胜利，并巩固这个胜利。
