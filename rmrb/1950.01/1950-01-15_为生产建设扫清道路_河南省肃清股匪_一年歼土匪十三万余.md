Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, January 14th: Bandits within Henan Province have been completely eliminated, and scattered bandits have also been largely suppressed. The Henan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army's communiqué on the results of bandit suppression in 1949 stated: Henan has historically been a region with many bandits. After the main forces of the Chiang bandits were largely eliminated, Kuomintang special agents organized bandits everywhere, attempting to wait for an opportunity to restore their rule and continue to oppress the people. Over the past year, under the continuous suppression by our army, especially after the Central China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China clearly instructed in June of last year that the central task in Henan Province should be bandit suppression, anti-local tyrant activities, and mobilizing the masses, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China then called for all-out efforts to complete this historical task. All field armies and military region forces stationed in Henan resolutely responded to this call and formulated plans to achieve meritorious service. With the determination that "we will not withdraw until the bandits are eliminated," the troops launched a full-scale encirclement and suppression campaign against the bandits in late July. At the same time, they vigorously carried out political offensives and mobilized the masses, closely integrating bandit suppression with the anti-tyranny movement, forming an unprecedented mass movement of clearing bandits and opposing local tyrants. Over the past year, a total of more than 130,000 bandits have been annihilated.

According to preliminary statistics: The total number of bandits killed or wounded throughout the year, from bandit leaders such as Liu Maoting, deputy commander and regiment commander of the Provisional 4th Division in western Henan, and Bai Yunjian, deputy commander of the Anhui-Northern Henan Pacification Zone, down to ordinary bandits, was 5,781.

The following bandits were captured: Li Zikui, commander of the New 1st Division in western Henan; Hu Junping, deputy commander of the New 2nd Division; Chen Dinghou, guerrilla commander and division commander; Feng Li, commander of the Suiyuan Detachment; Zheng Tengyun, commander of the Hubei-Henan People's Self-Defense Army; and 52,629 others.

The following surrendered to us: Ren Taisheng, commander of the New 2nd Division in western Henan; Ning Ganchen, deputy commander of the New 3rd Division; Ren Zonglu, detachment commander; and 12,190 others.

The following registered and repented: Wang Yunting, regiment commander of the New 3rd Division; and 61,685 others.

Throughout the year, a total of 216 various artillery pieces, 934 light and heavy machine guns, 157,709 various long and short guns, more than 2,036,000 rounds of ammunition, and many other telephone, telecommunications equipment, and military supplies were seized.
