Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 31st: TASS Khabarovsk, 30th - On the morning of December 29th, the court continued to interrogate witnesses. The first to be interrogated was Hotta, who served as quartermaster in Unit 731 in November 1944. He testified that during his time in the unit, he had visited the bacteriological weapons experimental station of the unit in Anda. He testified that the commander of Unit 731, Shiro Ishii, had told some of his subordinates that the war against the Soviet Union would begin between June and September 1945, so it was necessary to step up the production of bacteriological weapons. He testified that, to his knowledge, 7 million yen out of the 10 million yen annual budget allocated to Unit 731 was used to prepare work related to bacteriological weapons.

The court then interrogated witnesses Seogoe Kenichi and Sasaki, who served in the Fourth Section of the Quartermaster Department of Unit 731. Seogoe testified that the Fourth Section was engaged in the manufacture of ceramic bomb casings, which were intended to be filled with plague-infected fleas. Sasaki testified that ten personnel from the section led by Lieutenant Higuchi went to inland China to carry out bacteriological sabotage work. He had sent boxes of bacteria to the airport for delivery to this group of personnel.

The court also interrogated five witnesses: Ozeki, Saito, Kuwahara, Kemuri, and Takayuki. Kuwahara testified that after the Japanese Kwantung Army had surrendered to the Soviet Army, Kimura, Kubota, and Itada, who were working in Unit 100 at the time, injected sixty horses with anthrax bacteria and drove these horses into villages that the Soviet Army was approaching in order to use them as a means of infection. Colonel Takayuki, the former chief of the intelligence section of the 13th Army Command, testified that the 13th Army possessed a bacteriological unit organized by personnel from the Nanjing "Rong" Unit. In 1942, the army carried out the so-called Zhejiang Campaign in accordance with the orders of the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army. On August 25th, Shiro Ishii flew to the war zone of the 13th Army. After the 13th Army was forced to retreat, airplanes were used to scatter infectious disease bacteria over the enemy's positions, resulting in an epidemic of infectious diseases within the Chinese army's positions.

At this point, the court concluded the interrogation of witnesses.

Academician Zhukov of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences read out the written opinion of the forensic experts committee on behalf of experts Krasnov and four others. The opinion of the experts committee stated: "The experts committee, through scientific analysis, confirms that the experimental and manufacturing activities of Unit 731, Unit 100, and Unit 1644 were aimed at investigating and manufacturing bacteriological weapons and studying methods of using such weapons. The content of this work is extremely arrogant and is exactly the opposite of the tasks of human science.” The opinion stated: “For many centuries, scientific epidemiology has studied and developed methods to eliminate and prevent epidemics, while these units have studied methods to artificially spread these epidemics. Agriculturalists and veterinarians have made great efforts to increase the harvest of useful plants and the reproduction of useful livestock, while these units have studied methods and means to destroy rye, wheat, cattle, horses, and sheep."

In discussing the degree of danger of the bacteriological attacks carried out by Unit 731 in the Central China region, the experts committee emphasized that the bacteriological attack carried out under the command of Shiro Ishii in the Ningbo area was "not only extremely dangerous for the residents of the Ningbo area, but also very dangerous for many adjacent areas." The experts committee also pointed out that if the plans of the Japanese bacteriological units were realized, neutral countries would also be threatened, and this threat would arise from the nature of infectious diseases themselves and the characteristics of artificial transmission.

The court concluded its morning session at this point. In the afternoon, State Prosecutor Smirnov spoke in court.

    伯力续审讯日细菌战犯
    苏法医专家委员会发表意见           
    痛斥日战犯违反科学的罪行
    【新华社北京三十一日电】塔斯社伯力三十日讯：十二月二十九日上午，法庭继续审问证人。首先被审问的是一九四四年十一月到七三一部队任军需官的堀田。他供称，他在该部工作时，曾到该部在安达的细菌武器实验站看过。他供称，七三一部队长石井四郎曾告诉他的某些僚属说，对苏战争将在一九四五年六月至九月开始，因此必需加紧制造细菌武器。他供称，据他所知，在拨给七三一部队每年一千万日元的经费中，有七百万元系用于准备与细菌武器有关的工作。
    法庭继即审问曾在七三一部队军需处第四科服务的证人濑越贤一、佐佐木。濑越供称：第四科是从事制造陶瓷炸弹壳的，这些弹壳是准备装带有鼠疫的跳蚤的。佐佐木供称，樋口少尉领导下的那一科的十名人员，曾去中国关内进行细菌破坏工作，他曾把一箱箱细菌送至飞机场，运交给该批人员。
    法庭还审问了证人尾关、斋藤、桑原、烟木、高雪等五人。桑原供称，在日本关东军已向苏军投降后，当时在一百号部队工作的木村、久保田、板田三人，曾用炭疽热菌注射了六十匹马，并把这些马赶到苏军正在逼近的村庄中去，以便作为传染的媒介。前第十三军司令部情报处处长高雪大佐供称，第十三军拥有由南京“荣”部队人员组织的细菌部队。一九四二年，该军遵照日本中国派遣军总司令的命令，进行了所谓浙江战役。八月二十五日，石井四郎坐飞机到了十三军的战区。在十三军被迫撤退后，就用飞机向对方阵地散布传染病细菌，因此中国军队阵地内就流行了传染病。
    至此，法庭结束了对证人的审问。
    苏联医学院院士朱柯夫代表专家克拉斯诺夫等五人宣读法医学专家委员会的书面意见。专家委员会的意见书称：“专家委员会以科学的分析，证实七三一部队、一百号部队和一六四四部队的实验与制造活动，乃旨在调查与制造细菌武器以及研究使用这种武器的方法。这些工作的内容异常狂妄，与人类科学的任务恰恰相反。意见书称：“科学的流行病学许多世纪以来，曾经研究并发展消灭和预防流行病的方法，而这些部队却研究出人工散布这些流行病的方法。农业学家和兽医学家尽了极大的努力，以增加有用植物的收获和有用牲畜的繁殖，而这些部队却研究出摧毁裸麦、小麦和牛、马、羊的方法和手段。”
    在谈及七三一部队在华中地区进行的细菌攻击的危险程度问题时，专家委员会强调称：石井四郎指挥之下在宁波地区进行的细菌攻击，“不仅对于宁波地区居民异常危险，同时对于许多毗邻地区亦是很危险的”。专家委员会还指出，假如日本细菌部队的计划实现了，中立国家也会受到威胁，这种威胁系由于传染病本身的性质和人工传播的特点而产生的。
    法庭至此结束其上午的审讯。下午，国家检察官斯米尔诺夫在法庭上发言。
