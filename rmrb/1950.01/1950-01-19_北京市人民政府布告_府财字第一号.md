Announcement of the Beijing Municipal People's Government
Finance Document No. 1

	I. The "Provisional Measures for the Collection of Real Estate Tax in Beijing Municipality" was promulgated and implemented on December 1, 1949.

	II. The real estate tax for the year 1949 will be collected starting from the date of this announcement. All taxpayers shall pay the tax to the designated banks in the city within ten days of receiving the notification. Those who fail to pay within the time limit will be punished according to regulations.

	III. In addition to the regular real estate tax, an additional education and health fee of 30% will be levied, uniformly calculated at a rate of 800 yuan per catty of rice based on the tax amount.

	IV. Land within the city used for growing crops should be subject to agricultural tax in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for the Progressive Agricultural Tax." However, after investigation, the use of agricultural land in the urban area is complex, mostly scattered operations. After harvest, it is immediately consumed, with very little grain stored. Furthermore, land price tax has been levied in the urban area in the past. If re-registration and assessment are carried out to change to agricultural tax, the masses will face many difficulties. Therefore, real estate tax will continue to be levied this year, and agricultural tax will not be levied.

	V. All households without a formal deed or holding a white deed who have not completed registration procedures, resulting in missed payment of land price tax, are also limited to submitting declarations and paying taxes to the Finance Bureau voluntarily before January 31, 1950. Past tax omissions will be treated leniently and not investigated.

	VI. The names and addresses of the collecting banks are listed below. Please comply accordingly.

    北京市人民政府布告
    府财字第一号
    一、本市地产税征收暂行办法业于一九四九年十二月一日公布施行。
    二、一九四九年度地产税定于布告之日起开始征收，各纳税义务人于接到通知书十日内向本市各指定银行缴纳，逾期不缴者，照章处罚。
    三、于地产税正税外附征教育卫生费百分之三十，统按税额小米每斤八○○元折款征收。
    四、本市城内种植农作物土地，本应依照农业累进税暂行办法征农业税，但经调查结果，城区农地使用情形复杂，大都分散经营，收获之后，随即消耗，存粮甚少，且过去城区均征地价税，若重新登记评产，改征农业税，群众困难很多，故本年仍征地产税，不征农业税。
    五、凡无契或持有白契业户，而未办理登记手续，致漏交地价税者，亦限于一九五○年一月三十一日以前，自动向财政局申报纳税，以往漏税，从宽不究。
    六、兹将收款银行名称地址附后，希即一体遵照。
