    Shandong Troops Widely Conduct Cultural Learning

    [This newspaper dispatch] Since the past half-year, troops in various parts of Shandong have extensively carried out cultural learning. Leading cadres at all levels have taken the initiative, forming various working groups and establishing various systems, using a mutual teaching and learning method of "everyone a teacher, everyone a student," to organize all cadres and soldiers into learning groups. In terms of learning content, they have firmly grasped the method of "unity of teaching, learning, and doing." When soldiers learn military movements and shooting theory, cultural lessons are also integrated into the education. When the East Sea Military Sub-district office studies, it adopts the method of "less but refined," with more practice related to reality. For example, when teaching punctuation marks, the superiors' instructions or notices are distributed to everyone with the punctuation marks removed, so that each group can study and add them; then, the teachers give a unified explanation. In this way, they learn culture and study the superiors' instructions. In a certain training camp of the Qinghe Military Sub-district, more than half of the people were illiterate in the past. After adopting this "unity of learning and application" learning method, in just over four months, almost everyone could make simple discussion records.

    山东各地部队广泛开展文化学习
    【本报讯】山东各地部队半年来已广泛开展了文化学习。各级领导干部亲自动手，组成各种工作小组，建立各种制度，以“人人作先生，人人作学生”的互教互学方式，把所有干部战士编组学习。在学习内容上，紧紧掌握了“教学做一致”的方法。战士们在学习军事动作及射击学理时，文化课也结合进行教育。东海军分区机关学习时，采用“少而精”，联系实际多练习的方式，如教标点符号时，把上级的指示或通知删去标点符号发给大家，让各组一面研究一面加添；而后，教员再统一讲解，这样，既学了文化，又研究了上级的指示。清河军分区某教导营，过去文盲占总人数一半以上，经采用这种“学用一致”的学习方法，仅四个多月时间，差不多人人能作简单的讨论记录了。
