    Wu Han Broadcast
    Mobilize the Whole City to Enthusiastically Promote Victory Bonds
    [This newspaper dispatch] Wu Han, Director of the Beijing Municipal People's Victory Indexed Bonds Promotion Committee, broadcast on Beijing People's Broadcasting Station on the 10th, entitled: "Mobilize the Whole City to Enthusiastically Promote Victory Bonds!" He said: "The issuance of Victory Indexed Bonds is to make up for a portion of the financial deficit, reduce the issuance of banknotes, and systematically withdraw currency, so that the national prices in 1950 can gradually stabilize, in order to begin guaranteeing the stable life of people of all strata and the normal development of industry and commerce. 1950 is a year of great historical significance for the complete liberation of China, and the transition of the national economy from wartime to peacetime. We deeply believe that the industrialists, merchants, and local figures in Beijing, proceeding from taking care of the overall situation and the interests of the broad masses of the people, and using their own strength to solve their own difficulties, will surely enthusiastically support the issuance of Victory Indexed Bonds and actively subscribe to them." Then, after he described the various benefits of Victory Indexed Bonds being actually indexed savings, he said: "The burden on Chinese farmers is still very heavy at present. In the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation, farmers have already made the greatest contribution to the cause of the people's revolution. We should no longer allow farmers to bear this kind of Victory Indexed Bond. The industrialists, merchants, and local figures in our city are fully capable and responsible for completing the task assigned to us in Beijing by the Central Government. Therefore, industrialists and local figures must do their part for the country and take on the responsibility of purchasing the majority of the bonds, in order to overcome the temporary financial difficulties encountered in the victory of the motherland." Finally, he called on the sub-committees of the bond promotion committees of each unit to conduct thorough mobilization and propaganda for each cadre, and called on all compatriots in the city to take the lead nationwide, and to gloriously and happily complete their tasks with joyful and inspiring hearts.
