Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th – The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang today issued a telegram calling on local branches or branch preparatory committees to assist the People's Government in promoting the People's Victory Indexed Bonds. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To the Beijing Branch and various preparatory committees: The committee attaches great importance to the issue of assisting the government in promoting the Victory Indexed Bonds and lists it as a central task, launching publicity and mobilization. Central Committee members in Beijing, under the leadership of Chairman Li, are scheduled to go to the People's Bank at No. 1 Qianmen Street at 10:00 AM on the 10th of this month to personally subscribe. Moreover, the 7th Standing Committee meeting resolved to establish a Victory Indexed Bond Promotion Working Group to concentrate efforts and jointly devise a plan. In addition to waiting for the advancement methods to be decided and notified separately, it is hoped that a meeting will be quickly convened within three days of receiving this document to determine a specific time for comrades to jointly purchase first, take the lead, and launch a propaganda campaign. In particular, efforts should be made to persuade people in industrial, commercial, and financial circles in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hong Kong to subscribe through friendly relations!

[Our Newspaper] The 5th Working Conference of the China National Democratic Construction Association was held yesterday (10th) at 7:00 PM.

The report meetings should include short dramas or recreational programs with propaganda significance as much as possible. (2) All activities of the China National Democratic Construction Association in January, February, and March will focus on promoting the People's Victory Indexed Bonds.
