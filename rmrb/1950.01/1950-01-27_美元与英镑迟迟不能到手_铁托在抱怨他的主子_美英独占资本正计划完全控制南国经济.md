    US Dollars and Pounds Sterling are Slow to Arrive
    Tito Complains About his Masters
    US-UK Monopoly Capital Plans to Completely Control Southern Country's Economy
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch] Reuter's London, 18th: US State Department officials are studying a secret report from Belgrade claiming that Yugoslav dictator Tito has instructed his diplomatic representatives in London and Washington to express regret that the US and UK have failed to fulfill their political and economic obligations to Yugoslavia. The informal note claims that the promises of political and economic "aid" made by Britain and the United States to Yugoslavia have largely gone unfulfilled. The increasing demands of the US and UK are placing the Yugoslav government in a very difficult position, causing Tito great anxiety.

    Tito accuses the British government of dragging its feet on the Anglo-Yugoslav trade agreement in order to extract "extreme concessions" from Yugoslavia. Tito complains that his government, however, is extremely interested in this treaty for domestic political reasons. Tito has proposed further economic concessions to Britain as "proof of Yugoslavia's goodwill."

    The Belgrade dictator is also not satisfied with the pro-Tito propaganda of the US and UK. In his complaints to Washington and London, he demands a more vigorous propaganda campaign for the benefit of both the Yugoslav people and world opinion. In newspapers and on the radio, Yugoslavia must be treated on an equal footing with the Western "allies" of the US and UK, without the exceptions still being made by some Western commentators.

    He demands special emphasis on the role played by Tito's diplomats in international organizations, in the anti-Soviet and anti-People's Democracy movements organized by Western countries, and on Yugoslavia's "assistance" to Western "democracies". Tito further hopes that US-UK propaganda must cooperate more closely with Yugoslav propaganda.

    Yugoslav diplomatic representatives in Washington and London have received further orders to inform the US and UK governments of Yugoslavia's demands for free use of the port of Salonika and free passage through Greek territory. In exchange for this service from the Athens royalist fascists, Tito proposes "adjusting the Macedonian issue between Greece and Yugoslavia on terms acceptable to the Greek government."

    Well-informed sources in London say that Yugoslavia's complaints are a direct result of US demands for "guarantees" for US investment and loans in the country. The Americans (i.e., the Washington World Bank) are preparing to grant Tito another $25 million loan on terms far more brutal than those of the initial loan, conditions that mean the absolute subjugation of the Yugoslav economy to US monopoly capital. Britain is also taking advantage of the Tito regime's unfavorable economic and political situation to delay the implementation of trade terms. Allen, the new US Ambassador to Belgrade, stopped in London en route to Yugoslavia, not only for political reasons but also for economic ones. He revealed the coordination of US and UK capital in pressuring Tito and the various methods used to avoid US-UK "competition" in Yugoslavia, which means precisely delineating the scope of the "guarantees" that US-UK monopoly capital may demand from Tito.

    As for Yugoslavia's request for passage through Greek territory to the port of Salonika, it is noted that some time ago, the US indicated its agreement that Tito would receive US military supplies through Salonika, and the US Ambassador to Athens has received detailed instructions regarding the extent to which he can satisfy Tito's demands in this regard. It is expected that steps will be taken to establish the beginning of a Yugoslav-Greek "alliance" under US protection shortly after the Greek parliamentary elections.

    美元与英镑迟迟不能到手
    铁托在抱怨他的主子
    美英独占资本正计划完全控制南国经济
    【新华社讯】电通社伦敦十八日电：美国外交部官员正研究来自贝尔格莱德的秘密报告，该报告声称：南斯拉夫独裁者铁托已训令其驻伦敦和华盛顿外交代表对于美英两国未履行其对南斯拉夫的政治和经济义务表示遗憾。非正式的照会声称：英国和美国允予南斯拉夫以政治和经济“援助”的诺言，大多仍未履行。英美的日益增加的要求正使南斯拉夫政府处于非常困难的境地，铁托为之感到极大的忧惧。
    铁托责难英国政府对英南贸易协定实行怠工，以便从南斯拉夫获取“极大的让步”。铁托抱怨称：然而他的政府为了国内政治的理由，对于这一条约感到极大的兴趣。铁托对英国提出进一步的经济让步，作为“南斯拉夫的善意的证明”。
    贝尔格莱德独裁者对于英美的亲铁托宣传也不够满意。在他的对华盛顿和伦敦的抱怨中，他要求一种为了南斯拉夫人民和世界舆论两者的利益的更有力的宣传运动。在报纸和广播中，南斯拉夫必须被放在和英美的西方“盟国”同等的地位来看待，而不能有某些西方评论家所仍然在作的那些例外。
    他要求对铁托的外交家们在国际机构中、在西方国家所组织的反苏和反人民民主国家的运动中所起的作用，以及南斯拉夫对西方“民主国家”的“援助”加以特别的强调。铁托进一步希望英美的宣传与南斯拉夫的宣传必须更密切地合作。
    南斯拉夫驻华盛顿和伦敦的外交代表已接获进一步命令，把南斯拉夫关于自由使用萨罗尼加港口和自由通过希腊领土的要求，通知美国和英国政府。为了换取雅典保皇法西斯的这种服务，铁托提出“在希腊政府可以接受的条件下，调整希腊与南斯拉夫马其顿人问题”。
    伦敦消息灵通方面人士称：南斯拉夫的抱怨是美国要求南国对美国投资和贷款加以“保证”的直接结果。美国人（即华盛顿世界银行）正准备在远比首次贷款的那些条件更残酷的和意味着使南斯拉夫经济绝对地隶属于美国独占资本的条件下，给予铁托又一批二千五百万美元的贷款。英国也正利用铁托政权的不利的经济与政治局势，拖延履行贸易的条款。美国新任驻贝尔格莱德大使艾伦在赴南斯拉夫途中停留在伦敦，不仅是因为政治的原因并且也是为经济的原因。他透露美国和英国资本对铁托的压力的配合与用以避免英美在南斯拉夫“竞争”的各种方法，这就是说确切地划定英美独占资本可能要求铁托给予“保证”的范围。
    至于南斯拉夫要求通过希腊境内到萨罗尼加港口一事，据指出在若干时间以前，美国曾表示同意，铁托将通过萨罗尼加得到美国的军事物资，美国驻雅典大使已收到关于他可以满足铁托在这方面的要求到什么程度的详尽训令。预期在希腊议会选举后不久，将会采取在美国保护下建立南斯拉夫——希腊“同盟”的开端的步骤。
