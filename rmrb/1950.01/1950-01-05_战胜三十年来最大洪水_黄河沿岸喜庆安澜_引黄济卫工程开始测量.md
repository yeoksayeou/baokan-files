    Overcoming the Largest Flood in Thirty Years
    Yellow River Banks Celebrate Tranquility
    Yellow River Diversion to the Wei River Project Begins Surveying
    [This Newspaper Reports] Last year, during the Yellow River flood season, from Mengjin upstream to the mouth of the Bohai Sea downstream, along the thousand-mile-long defense line, under the unified leadership of the party committees and governments of Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces, and the Yellow River management organizations; with the concerted efforts of the special districts, counties, and the broad masses of people along the river; and with the heroic, selfless spirit of our entire river staff, we were of one mind and overcame the unprecedented flood of the last thirty years, completing the great task of preventing breaches, safeguarding the highest interests of the people, and creating a historical miracle. In order to summarize this experience, commend the heroes and models of Yellow River management, and celebrate the victory over five major floods, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission decided to convene Anlan (tranquility) conferences in each province. Henan and Pingyuan provinces plan to hold them in January of this year. Shandong Province held the Anlan conference on December 20th at the site of the Huiji County River Affairs Bureau.

    [Further News] In order to develop agricultural production in the new China, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission is undertaking the Yellow River Diversion to the Wei River project (i.e., diverting Yellow River water for irrigation and to supplement the Wei River, so that the Wei River can be navigable even during low water levels). In mid-November, a Yellow River surveying team of 71 people was organized. After a month of training, they departed from Bian City and began surveying work at the Yellow River's north bank construction site. To meet the needs of the work, the team is divided into six groups: topography (three groups), leveling (two groups), and traverse (one group). The surveying area extends from the north bank upstream of the Zhengzhou Railway Bridge to the diversion head at Xinxiang, the sediment settling basin, and the irrigation canals in the east and west dry areas. The topographic survey covers 1,272 square kilometers. Within the survey area, river cross-sections are measured once per kilometer, and flow rates are measured once every ten kilometers. Permanent monitoring stations are established at the canal head at Yuancun, Xinxiang, Huojia, and Ji County. The project is scheduled to be completed from late last month to late June of this year.

    战胜三十年来最大洪水
    黄河沿岸喜庆安澜
    引黄济卫工程开始测量
    【本报讯】去年黄河防汛，上自孟津下至渤海口，长达千里的防线上，在河南、平原、山东各省党政及治黄机关联合指挥部的统一领导下；在专县区及沿河广大人民一致的努力下；在我全河员工英勇奋斗忘我的精神下，万众一心，战胜了三十年来所未有的洪水，完成了不准决口的伟大任务，保障了人民最高的利益，创造了历史的奇迹。黄河水利委员会为了总结这一经验，表扬治黄英雄模范，庆祝战胜五次大水的胜利，决定分省召开安澜大会，河南、平原两省拟于今年一月召开，山东省假惠济县河务局所在地已于十二月二十日召开安澜大会。

    【又讯】为了发展新中国的农业生产，黄河水利委员会举办引黄济卫（按即引黄水灌田，并以黄水补卫水之不足，使卫河在水落时期亦能进行航运）工程，十一月中旬组织了引黄测量大队共七十一人，经过一个月的整训，已由汴市出发至黄河北岸工地开始测量工作。为适应工作需要该队共分地形（三个组）、水准（两个组）、导线（一个组）六个组，其测量范围是由郑州铁桥北岸上口至新乡分渠首，沉沙池及东西干区各灌田渠。地形测量计一二七二平方公里。在测区内河流每公里测量一次断面，每十公里测量一次流量等，并在渠首元村、新乡、获嘉、汲县设永久测站。该项工程计划自上月下旬起至今年六月下旬完成。
