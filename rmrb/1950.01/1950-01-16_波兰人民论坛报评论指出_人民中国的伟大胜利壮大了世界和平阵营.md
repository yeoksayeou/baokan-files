Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 15th: The Polish Press Agency, Warsaw, reports: The Polish People's Tribune (organ of the United Workers' Party) commented on the significance of the victory of People's China on the 10th, stating: The Chinese Revolution is the fruit of the October Revolution. The Chinese Revolution originated from the first victorious proletarian revolution, developed vigorously, and became an important factor influencing the balance of power between imperialism and socialism on a global scale. The victory of the Chinese Revolution sounded the death knell for all attempts to establish another zone of isolation in Asia.

The People's Tribune continued: The victory of the Chinese Revolution has increased the potential of the world peace camp by nearly half a billion people, immeasurable resources, and vast lands. Today, one-third of all mankind lives on territories liberated from capitalist rule, and we can see more clearly that the final outcome of the struggle between socialism and capitalism has been undoubtedly determined.

The newspaper further commented on the significant role China once played in the capitalist economic system, stating: China was a vast colonial market, a target for capital export, and a source of valuable raw materials and cheap labor. Therefore, China's departure from the capitalist economic system not only greatly damaged the foundation of imperialism in the colonies and its existence but also greatly damaged the foundations of imperialism in Wall Street and the "City of London."

    波兰人民论坛报评论指出
    人民中国的伟大胜利壮大了世界和平阵营
    【新华社北京十五日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰人民论坛报（统一工人党机关报）十日评人民中国胜利的意义称：中国革命是十月革命的果实。中国革命导源于第一次胜利的无产阶级革命，而获得蓬勃的发展，并成为在世界规模上影响帝国主义与社会主义间的力量对比的一个重要因素。中国革命的胜利给一切在亚洲建立另外一条隔绝地带的企图，敲起了丧钟。
    人民论坛报继称：中国革命的胜利使世界和平阵营的潜力，增加了近五亿的人民、无可估量的富源以及广大的土地。在今天，全体人类已有三分之一居住在从资本主义统治下获得解放的领土上，我们可以看得更清楚，社会主义和资本主义间斗争的最后结局是已经无可怀疑地确定了。
    该报进一步评述中国曾经在资本主义经济体系中所起的重大作用称：中国曾是庞大的殖民地市场，作为资本输出的对象，而且又是宝贵原料与廉价人力的来源。因此中国脱离资本主义的经济体系，不但大大损害了帝国主义在殖民地的基础及其存在，也大大损害了华尔街与《伦敦城》的帝国主义的基础及其存在。
