    "Poor People" and "Rich People"
    Linguistic Musings
    Ya Qun
    After reading Mr. Ye Shengtao and Mr. Shao Yanxiang's articles on language issues (this publication, 4th and 9th), I feel there is another problem worth noting and studying at present.
    Some words have indeed taken root in many people's mouths and have been very popular, but the social conditions that produced these words have undergone fundamental changes. Progressive working people have naturally stopped using them, but we often still habitually use them in our articles. The most common examples are:
    "Poor people," "poor fellows," "rich people," "big shots," "landlords"...
    Originally, the "poverty" or "wealth" of living conditions—having money or not—was not entirely a marker of class. However, in the old society, "big shots" could largely represent the people of the reactionary ruling class; "landlords" and "rich people" were largely the oppressive and exploitative classes; "poor" and "poverty" could largely represent the working people. In order to make it easier for the masses to accept and to benefit the arousal of the masses' fighting spirit, using these words in contrast to each other didn't have any major problems in the past. But today, our revolutionary targets are mainly the landlord class and the bureaucrat-comprador class domestically, and not the national bourgeoisie. Therefore, it is inappropriate to say "rich people" or "landlords" in general terms. This can not only blur the masses' understanding of class, but also easily breed agricultural socialist ideas and lead to errors in distinguishing friends from enemies.
    First of all, those general "big shots" have basically disappeared from the land of the motherland (Taiwan and Hainan Island naturally still have some remnants, but they will soon be eliminated); people with relatively affluent living conditions are generally national industrialists and businesspeople, one of the four friends, and we cannot look at them with the eyes we used to treat the reactionary class. As for "poor people," there are ruined landlords, "loafers," and unemployed vagrants from all classes in the city. It is also inappropriate to lump these people together with the working people. And today, we want to transform this part of the unemployed vagrants in the city, so that they gradually have the opportunity to participate in production and gradually become real working people. In the vast rural areas after the land reform, although there are still poor peasants who have not risen up, most of those who have become "poor" are landlords who do not participate in labor and some local bullies who have been struggled against; ordinary peasants can now maintain a basic living with coarse clothes and simple food, and are no longer "poor people." Therefore, the mistake in generally saying "poor people" now lies in the lack of class character.
    The objective reality has undergone such fundamental changes, and consequently, the vocabulary reflected in the spoken language of many working people is also constantly changing and improving. The winter before last, in Beigou Village, Yuanshi County, Hebei (this place had only been liberated for a year at that time), I bought peanuts from a peasant digging peanuts in the field. I insisted on giving him money, but he insisted on refusing. After several awkward exchanges, he got angry and said with confidence and righteousness: "You are a cadre, I am a turned-over household, a basic member of the masses... you shouldn't look down on me too much!" In this conversation, "cadre," "turned-over household," and "basic member of the masses" were all used skillfully and reasonably. In short, most of the peasants in the old liberated areas no longer call themselves "poor people." "Turned-over household," "peasant," "basic member of the masses"... these are the words they use to refer to themselves. The workers in the city rarely heard themselves called "poor people" before liberation. They had already been using the words "worker" and "laborer." But now there are still many people who use those outdated or inappropriate words when writing articles, which is worthy of great attention from us engaged in writing. Of course, when writing popular works (especially clappers, drum songs, etc.), it is not easy to find suitable new words. This difficulty also exists, but as long as we conduct serious investigation and research, we can select and create appropriate new words. Moreover, the words "worker," "peasant," and "working people" are already mass terms with clear meanings, so why do we still have to use outdated words like "poor people" and "rich people"...?

    “穷人”与“阔人”
    语文杂谈
    亚群
    读了叶圣陶先生和邵燕祥先生谈语文问题的文章（本刊四日和九日）后，感到目前还有一个值得注意研究的问题。
    有些词汇，确实也曾经在许多人的嘴上生根，也很行得开，但产生这些词汇的社会条件已起了基本的变化，进步的劳动人民已很自然地不使用了，而我们每每还在文章里习惯地使用着。最普遍的如：
    “穷人”，“穷哥”，“有钱人”，“阔人”，“财主”……。
    本来生活条件的“穷”或“富”——有钱与无钱，并不完全是阶级的标帜，但在旧社会里：“阔人”大体上是可以代表反动统治阶级的人们的；“财主”、“有钱人”大体上是压迫阶级剥削阶级；“贫”、“穷”，大体上是可以代表劳动人民的。为了使得群众易于接收，有利于启发群众的斗争情绪，把这些词汇对照起来使用，在过去倒也没有什么大毛病。但今天我们革命的对象，在国内主要是地主阶级、官僚买办阶级，而不是民族资产阶级，因此，笼统地说“有钱人”或“财主”，就不妥当了。这不仅可以使群众对阶级的认识模糊不清，而且很容易滋长农业社会主义的思想，以及发生敌友不分的错误。
    首先，那一般“阔人”，在祖国的大地上已基本上不存在了（台湾、海南岛自然还有些残余，但很快就要被消灭）；生活条件比较富裕的人，大体上是民族工商业者，是四个朋友之一，我们不能以从前对待反动阶级的眼光去看他们。至于“穷人”，则有破落的地主，“二流子”，以及城市中来自各阶层的无业游民，把这些人与劳动人民混为一谈，也就不妥。而今天，城市的这一部分无业游民，我们是要改造他们，使他们逐渐地有机会参加生产，逐渐变成真正的劳动人民；经过土地改革的广大农村，虽仍有没有上升的贫农，但“穷”了的则大都为不参加劳动的地主和一些被斗争的恶霸分子；一般的农民则已能维持粗衣粗食，不再是“穷人”了。所以，现在笼统地说“穷人”，错误就在于缺乏阶级性。
    客观的实际既是这样地起了基本变化，因而反映在很多的劳动人民的口头语汇，也在不断地变化着，提高着。前年冬天我在河北元氏县北沟村（那时这地方解放才一年），向一个在地里刨花生的农民买花生，我一定要给钱，他一定不要，蹩扭几次，他发火了，理直气壮的说：“你是干部，我是翻身户，基本群众……你不要太瞧不起我！”这谈话中，“干部”、“翻身户”、“基本群众”都使用得纯熟而合理。总之，老解放区的农民大都不自称“穷人”了。“翻身户”，“农民”，“基本群众”……这才是他们自己称谓自己的语汇。城市的工人，则解放前也很少听得他们自称“穷人”的。“工人”，“劳工”这些语汇他们早已使用着。而现在还有很多的人写文章时，使用那些已经过时的或不恰当的语汇，是值得我们从事文字工作者大大注意的。自然，在写通俗化的作品（尤其是快板、鼓词之类）的时候，不容易觅得适当的新语汇，这种困难也是存在着的，但我们只要认真的调查研究，就可能选拔，创造适当的新的语汇。何况“工人”，“农民”，“劳动人民”这些词汇已经是含义明确的大众用语了，我们何必还要用“穷人”，“阔人”……这一类不合时宜的语汇呢？
