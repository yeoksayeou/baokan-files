Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 21st: Public enterprises in Tianjin, such as trolleybus, tap water, and public bus companies, have completely reversed the loss-making situation they faced before liberation by improving their management. They are now making a profit or breaking even. The trolleybus company has reduced its operating cost per vehicle per kilometer by 54% compared to the pre-liberation era due to savings in electricity and oil, accelerated trolleybus turnover, and increased passenger numbers. The tap water company has also reduced its cost of selling per hundred gallons of water by more than 40% compared to the early post-liberation period. Since June of last year, the Public Bus Management Office has successively replaced gasoline with charcoal and a mixture of charcoal and hard coal as fuel, and the cost per kilometer of driving in November has decreased by more than 50% compared to July. The reduction in costs is the result of continuous progress in the management of various enterprises. Over the past year, various units have successively carried out tasks such as streamlining staff and implementing cost accounting on a trial basis. From the end of November, the trolleybus company also implemented a quota system, accelerated vehicle operation rates, and reduced liability accidents accordingly. Currently, field workers at the Public Bus Management Office and the waterworks have also started to implement a quota system. In addition, the establishment and development of the work of trade unions and factory management committees in various units has played a significant role in raising workers' awareness and promoting their production enthusiasm, and has become an important factor in the continuous progress of business operations.

    津市公用企业改善经营管理
    【新华社天津二十一日电】天津市的电车、自来水和公共汽车等公用企业，由于改善经营管理，现已完全改变了解放前的赔钱现象，做到有盈余或收支平衡。电车公司由于电力和机油节省，电车周转加速，乘客人数增加等原因，去年十一月每车每公里的行车成本较解放前降低了百分之五十四；自来水公司每百加仑的售水成本也较解放初降低百分之四十以上。公共汽车管理处从去年六月以后，先后用木炭和木炭与硬煤的混合燃料代替汽油，每公里行车成本十一月份较七月份已降低百分之五十以上。成本降低是各企业单位经营管理工作不断进步的结果。一年来，各单位曾先后进行了精简冗员、试行成本会计等项工作。从十一月底开始，电车公司又实行了定员制，加速了车辆运行率，责任事故亦随之减少。现公共汽车管理处和自来水厂的外勤职工也开始实行定员制。此外，各单位工会和工厂管理委员会的建立及其工作的开展，亦对提高工人觉悟发挥生产积极性起了很大作用，并成为业务经营不断进步的一个重要因素。
