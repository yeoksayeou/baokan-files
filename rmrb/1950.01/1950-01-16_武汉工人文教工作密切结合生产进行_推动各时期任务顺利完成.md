    Wuhan Workers' Cultural and Educational Work Closely Integrated with Production to Promote the Smooth Completion of Tasks in Various Periods
    [This newspaper's report] Since the liberation of Wuhan, workers' cultural and educational work has been carried out around the center of production, organizing workers' learning and recreational activities. With the progress of production and trade union work, cultural and educational work has also developed extensively and achieved great results.
    In the early days of liberation, workers' cultural and educational work mainly consisted of organizing lectures, large classes, large and small meetings, and launching mass recreational activities (such as Yangko dances) in conjunction with various mass movements (such as celebrating the liberation and commemorating "July 1st"). Through this stage of education, the broad masses of workers gained a preliminary understanding of the fact that the working class is the master of the country and the leading class of the regime, the truth that labor creates the world, the relationship between the Communist Party and the working class, the current political situation, and urban policies. This improved their class consciousness and political awareness, and initially established a new attitude towards labor. Therefore, they showed high enthusiasm in production, assisted the government in completing the acceptance and inventory work; in the work of restoring and developing production, they utilized waste materials, donated equipment, and researched improvements and created production tools, demonstrating a high degree of initiative and creativity, and gradually established trade unions.
    With the widespread establishment of trade union organizations, workers' cultural and educational work further developed. Study groups were universally organized in various factories, and spare-time schools, literacy classes, night schools, and training courses were established in large numbers. Various recreational activity organizations also became more widespread. Through this stage of education, workers made great strides in their understanding of trade union organizations, the democratic management of state-owned factories, the signing of collective labor-capital contracts in private enterprises, and internationalist education. This not only improved the political level of workers, but also began a more regular learning process to improve their cultural and technical levels. The literacy class of the Hankou Battery Factory has enabled workers who did not know how to read to recognize more than 300 characters in more than four months; workers who participated in literacy classes in various factories generally learned 50 to 200 new characters, laying the foundation for future cultural learning. Several factories have transformed and created many machines through technical class studies. The multi-faceted development of cultural and educational work has greatly inspired, encouraged, and improved labor enthusiasm. For example, during the major overhaul movement of the Jinghan Railway, newsletters and correspondence were published, consolation letters were written, theatrical performances were organized, and new lyrics and clapper talks were created to encourage each other in their work, setting off a climax of competition. At the same time, heroes and models were commended, experiences were exchanged, deviations in the work were corrected, and working methods were improved, ensuring that the working mood of all the rush-repair workers remained high, guaranteeing the completion of this huge task as scheduled. In private enterprises, such as the four major yarn factories and the shop assistants' and cloth workers' union, workers were mobilized and led to study labor-capital policies, strengthening their understanding of the policies and smoothly completing the signing of collective labor-capital contracts.
    According to incomplete statistics in mid-December 1949, 16,000 workers in 59 units in the city participated in study groups; 17,000 workers participated in spare-time night schools and literacy classes. 570 people have already studied at the Central China Workers' School, and 4,500 people have studied in short-term training courses. In terms of literary and artistic activities, there are already 19 workers' theater troupes with 648 participants; each factory has a Yangko team with 10,000 participants; 2,337 workers in 48 units participate in singing groups; 1,249 people in 19 units participate in sports organizations. A total of 201 issues of wall newspapers were published in 59 units, and each factory had a blackboard newspaper. More than 70 kinds of scripts, quick reports, and living newspapers were created by workers. 924 workers participated in the correspondence group of the Central China Workers' Newspaper.

    武汉工人文教工作密切结合生产进行
    推动各时期任务顺利完成
    【本报讯】武汉市解放以来的工人文教工作，在以生产为中心的方针下，围绕着这一中心来开展工人的学习与文娱活动，随着生产工作和工会工作的进展，文教工作也普遍地发展起来，收到了很大成绩。
    在刚解放时，工人文教工作主要是通过组织讲座、上大课、开大会小会，结合各种群众运动（如庆祝解放、纪念“七一”）发动组织群众文娱活动（如秧歌）来进行的。经过这一阶段的教育，使广大工人群众对工人阶级是国家的主人翁、政权的领导阶级，劳动创造世界的真理，共产党与工人阶级的关系，当前的政治情势以及城市政策，都有了初步认识，提高了阶级觉悟与政治认识，初步建立了新的劳动态度。因此，在生产上发挥了高度热情，协助政府完成了接收清点工作；在恢复与发展生产工作中，利用废料，捐献器材、研究改良和创造生产工具，表现出高度的积极性和创造性，而且逐步地建立了工会。
    随着工会组织的普遍建立，工人文教工作进一步发展。各厂普遍组织学习小组，业余学校、识字班、夜校、轮训班大量开办，各种文娱活动组织也更普遍。经过这一阶段教育，使工人对工会组织的认识，公营工厂的民主管理工作、私营企业的订立劳资集体合同工作，以及国际主义教育，都前进了一大步。不但使工人政治水平提高，而且开始走向提高文化、技术水平的较经常的学习。汉口电池厂的识字班，四个多月来使不认字的工人有的认识了三百多字；凡各厂参加识字班的工人，普遍的学会了五十至二百个生字，打下了今后学习文化的基础。有几个厂通过技术班的学习，改造和创造了不少机器。文教工作的多面开展，大大启发、鼓舞、提高了劳动热忱。如京汉铁路大翻修运动中，出版了快报、通讯，发动了写慰问信、组织剧团演出、编创新歌词、快板等，在工作中互相鼓励，掀起了竞赛高潮；同时表扬英雄模范，交流经验，纠正工作中的偏向，改进了工作方式和方法，使全体抢修工人工作情绪始终饱满，保证了这一巨大任务的如期完成。在私营企业中，如四大纱厂和店员布业工会，发动并领导工人学习劳资政策，加强了工人对政策的了解，顺利地完成订立劳资集体合同。
    据一九四九年十二月中旬不完全统计，全市五十九个单位中参加学习小组学习的工人有一万六千人；参加业余夜校、识字班的共一万七千人。到华中工人学校学习的已经有五百七十人，在短期训练班学习过的已经有四千五百人。在文艺活动方面，已有十九个工人剧团，六百四十八人参加；秧歌队各厂都有，参加的有一万人；四十八个单位里参加歌咏队的工人达二千三百三十七人；十九个单位里参加体育组织的有一千二百四十九人。五十九个单位共出版壁报二百零一期，黑板报各厂都有。工人创作的剧本、快报、活报等有七十多种。九百二十四名工人参加了华中工人报的通讯组。
