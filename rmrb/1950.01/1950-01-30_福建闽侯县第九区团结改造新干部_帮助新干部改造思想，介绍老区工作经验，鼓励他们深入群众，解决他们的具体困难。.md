(Reported by this newspaper) Fujian News: In the vast rural work of the new district, uniting and educating the intellectual cadres who have newly joined the work is an important part of smoothly carrying out the work. The Ninth District of Minhou County, Fujian Province, has gained experience in this regard. The first is to strengthen the political education of new cadres and further establish the idea of serving the people. Make them understand what their work is for and how to subordinate personal interests to the interests of the revolution. Although intellectual cadres who have newly joined the work generally have a relatively high level of education after a short-term training class, their understanding is not deep enough and they lack practical experience. When encountering specific difficulties in actual work, they often cannot solve them. The leadership guides them to apply the revolutionary theory learned from books to actual work, and slowly transforms their thinking through group research, individual exchange of opinions, and correspondence. Facts have proved that as long as the ideology is clarified, it is easy to unite the new cadres. Because they understand the glory of serving the people's cause, they never feel depressed or complain about low wages or not being able to receive clothes in time. They have a high degree of thirst for knowledge and enterprising spirit, and the leadership should pay close attention to meeting their political and learning requirements as much as possible.

Secondly, introduce work experience and guide work methods. New cadres generally do not know how to do work and cannot grasp policies well. Old cadres should often talk to them, tell them how to carry out work, and how to approach the masses. The experience of mass work in the old liberated areas is very enlightening for new cadres. On the other hand, encourage new cadres to integrate with the masses in life, become familiar with the feelings of the masses, understand the suffering and demands of the masses, understand the class situation in rural areas, and understand and deal with problems from a class point of view. Create new experiences and methods in the work, and the leadership will often check and guide, and help them sum up experience. This can exercise their working ability, gradually learn to master policies, and avoid mistakes.

Third, grasp the backbone, unite the whole, and give timely praise and criticism. After a period of work test, positive and better elements will naturally appear among the new cadres, and individual ideological problems will also be exposed. At this time, the leadership should pay attention to supporting and praising good cadres, and use them as the core to encourage and unite all cadres to move forward together. For individual cadres who do not perform well, in the beginning, they should pay attention to taking care of their "competitive spirit" and "face", and do not say bad things about them in public. You can use the method of "heart-to-heart talks" to conduct active criticism and encourage them to learn from good comrades. Pay attention to the sense of propriety when praising and criticizing. And criticism and self-criticism should be carried out among the masses to encourage each other to improve and create an atmosphere of unity and harmony.

Fourth, consideration and care in life are also indispensable. For new cadres, even a very small problem, the leadership should care about, so that the new comrades feel cordial. In daily life, help them solve difficulties, and when they cannot be solved temporarily, they should also patiently explain, so that they can understand the difficulties ideologically and further overcome the difficulties. Indifference to the new cadres can easily affect their emotions and even affect their work.

The above methods have been very effective in the district and have effectively guaranteed the smooth development of the work. According to the district, there are a total of seventeen cadres, of which only three responsible cadres have a longer history of participating in the revolution, two are recruited old staff, and the other twelve are all intellectual cadres who have newly joined the work. Thanks to the unity and education of the leadership, these cadres can work with enthusiasm and complete certain tasks.

    福建闽侯县第九区团结改造新干部
    帮助新干部改造思想，介绍老区工作经验，鼓励他们深入群众，解决他们的具体困难。
    【本报讯】福建消息：在广大新区农村工作中，团结与教育新参加工作的知识分子干部，是顺利开展工作的重要环节之一，福建省闽侯县第九区，在这方面已获得经验。首先就是加强新干部的政治教育，进一步确立为人民服务的思想。使其懂得自己的工作到底是为了什么；又怎样将个人利益服从革命的利益。新参加工作的知识分子干部，虽然一般经过短期的训练班学习，有着较高的文化程度，但认识还不够深刻，很缺乏实际经验。在实际工作中碰到具体困难时，往往解决不了。领导上就引导他们把从书本上学习到的革命理论运用到实际工作中去，采用小组研究、个别交换意见和通信等方式，慢慢改造他们的思想。事实证明：只要思想搞清楚了，新干部是容易团结的。由于了解了为人民服务事业的光荣，他们对于待遇低、不能及时领到衣服等困难从不感到苦闷或抱怨。他们有高度的求知欲和进取心，领导上要十分注意尽可能满足他们政治上学习上的要求。
    其次，介绍工作经验，指导工作方法。新干部一般不懂得怎样做工作，不能很好掌握政策。老干部应经常和他们谈话，告诉他们怎样展开工作，怎样接近群众。经常介绍老解放区群众工作经验，对新干部的启发作用很大。另一方面，鼓励新干部从生活上与群众打成一片，熟习群众感情，体会群众痛苦和要求，了解农村阶级情况，从阶级观点出发去认识和处理问题，在工作中创造出新的经验和方法，领导上经常检查指导，帮助他们总结经验。这样可以锻炼他们的工作能力，逐渐学会掌握政策，避免错误。
    第三，掌握骨干，团结全体，及时表扬与批评。经过一段工作考验，新干部中就会自然地出现积极的和较好的分子，个别思想毛病大的也会暴露出来。这时领导上就要注意扶植表扬好的干部，并以他们为核心去鼓励团结全体干部一同前进。对个别表现不好的，开始时要适当注意照顾其“好胜心”和“面子”，不要当众说他不好，可用“谈心”的方式，进行积极性的批评，鼓励他向好的同志看齐。在进行表扬与批评时要注意分寸。并应在群众间展开批评与自我批评，互相砥砺提高，造成团结融洽的空气。
    第四、生活上的体贴与关心也是不可少的。对于新干部，那怕是一个很小的问题，领导上也要关心，使新同志感到亲切。在日常生活上，帮助他们解决困难，暂时不能解决时，亦应耐心解释，使他们在思想上认识困难，进一步克服困难。对于新干部若漠不关心，容易影响他们的情绪，甚至对工作也有影响。
    上述各项方法在该区实行甚有效果，有力地保证了工作的顺利开展。按该区共有十七个干部，其中只有三个负责干部是参加革命历史较久的，两个是录用的旧职员，其他十二个人全是新参加工作的知识分子，由于领导上的团结教育，这些干部均能热情积极工作，完成一定任务。
