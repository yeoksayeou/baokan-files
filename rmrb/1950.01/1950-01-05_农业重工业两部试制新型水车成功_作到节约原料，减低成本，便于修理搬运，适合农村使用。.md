    Agriculture and Heavy Industry Ministries Successfully Trial New Type of Waterwheel
    Achieving savings in raw materials, reduced costs, easy repair and transport, suitable for rural use.
    [This newspaper reported] The Water Conservancy Promotion Society of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the Technology Office of the Ministry of Heavy Industry have successfully trialed a new type of waterwheel after more than two months of effort. Each waterwheel saves more than half of the raw materials, greatly reducing the cost, while its effectiveness is the same as that of the old type of waterwheel. There are two types of waterwheels that have been successfully trialed this time. One is the Liberation-style waterwheel, redesigned by the Technology Office of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government at the request of the Society. This type of waterwheel is divided into light and heavy types. The former weighs 69 kilograms and is suitable for deep water levels, and the latter weighs 76 kilograms and is suitable for shallow water levels. The other was researched and modified from the old type of waterwheel by the Promotion Society, and its weight is almost the same as that of the Liberation-style type. According to the person in charge of the Society: the purpose of this research and modification of the waterwheel is to save the raw materials required for the waterwheel in order to reduce costs; to simplify the manufacturing process so that general factories can manufacture it. And it should be easy to use, light in weight, and easy to transport, so that it is suitable for the current dispersed rural environment in China. These goals have been achieved by the newly made and modified waterwheels this time. Among the old types of more than ten kinds of waterwheels, the lightest is more than 140 kilograms, and the heaviest is more than 270 kilograms. Compared with the new type and the modified waterwheel, the weight is reduced by more than half, which can reduce the use of a large amount of cast iron and save a lot of national resources. This is one. Secondly, in the past, a waterwheel was worth about 1,300 catties of millet on average, while the successfully trialed waterwheel now costs no more than 1,000 catties of millet each, making it easier for farmers to buy cheap waterwheels and promote them on a large scale. Third, the manufacturing of old-fashioned waterwheels is not standardized, and some parts have many differences in structure, which makes it very inconvenient to repair. Either people are invited to the village to repair them, or the waterwheels are transported to the market town for repair, which wastes a lot of time and money. The waterwheel successfully trialed this time is constructed according to certain mechanical principles, making it easy to repair (because each part is manufactured according to a certain standard, if the original parts are broken, they can be replaced with new ones), runs flexibly, and discharges water evenly.
    When these two types of waterwheels were officially tested, representatives from all over the country who were invited to Beijing to attend the National Agricultural Production Conference were invited to visit and unanimously expressed their satisfaction. The Society is preparing to slightly improve the vertical shaft and iron chain of the Liberation-style waterwheel recently, and then place a large number of orders to various factories and promote it widely in areas with the habit of using waterwheels.

    农业重工业两部试制新型水车成功
    作到节约原料，减低成本，便于修理搬运，适合农村使用。
    【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部水利推进社与重工业部技术室经两月余努力，试制新型水车已获成功。每一辆水车节省一半以上原料，使成本大为降低，其效能则与旧型水车相同。此次试制成功的水车共有两种，一是由中央人民政府重工业部技术室在该社的委托下，重新设计的解放式水车。此种水车又分轻型与重型两种，前者重六十九公斤，适用于深水位，后者重七十六公斤，适用于浅水位。另一种由推进社研究，改造旧型水车而成，其重量与解放式型的相差无几。据该社负责人谈：此次研究改造水车的目的，是希望能够节省水车需用原料，以减低成本；简化制造过程，使一般工厂均能制造。并且要便于使用，重量轻，易于搬运，才适合于目前中国分散的农村环境。这一些目的，此次新制和改造成功的水车都已达到了。旧型的十余种水车中，最轻的有一百四十余公斤，重的则有二百七十多公斤。新型及改造后的水车与之相较，减低重量在一半以上，可以少用大量铸铁，节省了国家大量的资源，这是一。其次，过去一辆水车平均价值一千三百斤小米左右，而现在试制成功的水车，每辆最高不超过一千斤小米，使农民买到贱价水车，易于大量推广。第三，旧型水车的制造不规格化，有些零件在结构上出入很多，修理起来很不方便，不是请人到村修理，就是把水车运到集镇上去修理，往返浪费甚大。而这次试制成功的水车，则是按照一定的机械原理构造而成，修理方便（因每一部分均按一定标准制造，原零件坏了，换上新的即可），运转灵活，出水均匀。
    这两种水车正式试验时，邀请来京出席全国农业生产会议的各地代表前往参观，一致认为满意。该社准备于最近将解放式水车的立轴与铁链略加改进后，将大量向各工厂订制，并向有使用水车习惯的地区普遍推广。
