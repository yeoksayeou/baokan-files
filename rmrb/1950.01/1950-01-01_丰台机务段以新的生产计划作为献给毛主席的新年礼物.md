Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 31st: The entire workforce of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Tianjin Railway Bureau wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to wish him a Happy New Year. The letter stated that they wished to present the new production plan for 1950 as a New Year's gift to Chairman Mao. The original letter stated:

    Chairman Mao:
    We wholeheartedly thank you here: Because of your leadership and that of the Chinese Communist Party, we have moved from darkness to light. Fengtai has been liberated for a year, and we have been liberated from the suffering days of being oppressed and exploited. Now that we are the masters of the country, we will use all our strength to build our own country. We have already drawn up a new plan for 1950: In terms of operation, we guarantee 2.5 million safe kilometers of travel, and use the existing typical locomotive No. 1939 (which has now extended two Class A inspections, traveling 91,000 safe kilometers, and plans to extend the Class A inspection to complete 150,000 safe kilometers before July 1st) and the "May 1st Labor" locomotive, etc., as the backbone to establish a model locomotive team; in terms of the factory, we guarantee that the quality of locomotive maintenance will be improved by 50% compared with 1949. We would like to use these concrete actions as a New Year's gift to you. We wish you good health!
                             Respectfully, The Entire Workforce of Fengtai Locomotive Depot
                             December 28, 1949

    【新华社北京三十一日电】天津铁路局丰台机务段全体工人写信给毛主席贺年，信中表示愿以一九五○年新的生产计划作为送给毛主席的新年礼物。原信称：毛主席：
    我们在这里衷心地感谢您：由于您和中国共产党的领导，我们从黑暗走向了光明。丰台解放一年了，我们从被压迫被剥削的苦难日子里解放出来了。现在我们当了国家的主人，我们要拿出所有的力量来建设自己的国家。我们已经订出一九五○年新的计划：运转方面保证走行二百五十万安全公里，并以现有的典型机车一九三九号（现已延长两个甲检，走行九万一千安全公里，计划“七一”以前延长甲检完成十五万安全公里）及“五一劳动”号等为骨干，建立模范机车队；工厂方面保证机车检修质量较一九四九年提高百分之五十。我们谨以这些具体的行动，作为送给您的新年礼物。谨祝您身体健康！
