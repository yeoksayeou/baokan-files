*New Era* points out: A powerful struggle against the militarization of Western Europe and against the acceptance of American armaments is expanding in Western European countries. In France, a mass movement has already unfolded to support demands for the destruction and prohibition of atomic weapons and an end to the colonial war in Vietnam. A group of Bulgarian writers has published a collection of essays defending peace. One hundred Korean youths have refused to serve in Li Chengwan's army. Dutch women are calling on Dutch youth not to take up arms against the Indonesian people. Dockworkers in Antwerp refused to unload American weapons and called on their partners in other ports in Belgium to follow their example. All of this comes together to create a vast and moving movement.

*New Era* concludes: It should not be forgotten that the imperialists are eager to incite the people, to make them believe that war is inevitable, and that the struggle for peace is useless. This demoralizing propaganda is part of the imperialists' strategy. This is one of the insidious tricks of the enemies of peace. However, the facts prove that this trick has failed, and the secret of this strategy has been exposed. The people of every country are increasingly realizing that the future of peace is in their own hands, and that saving humanity from another world catastrophe depends only on their activity, strength, combativeness, and steadfastness.

    战贩卑鄙煽惑阴谋
    事实证明已告失败
    新时代指出：反对西欧军事化和反对接受美国军备的强有力的斗争，正在西欧各国扩展着。在法国，已经展开了群众性的运动，来支持关于销毁与禁止原子武器及结束在越南的殖民战争的要求。一群保加利亚作家出版了保卫和平文集。一百名朝鲜青年拒绝为李承晚服兵役。荷兰妇女号召荷兰青年不要拿起武器去反对印尼人民。安特术普的码头工人拒绝起卸美国武器，并号召在比利时其他港口的伙伴们，效法他们的榜样。这一切汇合起来，便造成了浩大的、动人的运动。
    新时代最后说：不应忘记，帝国主义渴望着煽惑人民，使他们相信战争不可避免，使他们相信争取和平的斗争毫无用处。这种旨在使人丧气的宣传是帝国主义的战略的一部分。这是和平敌人的阴险的诡计之一。然而，事实证明这种诡计已告失败，这一战略的秘密已被揭穿了。每个国家的人民正越来越了解到：和平的将来是掌握在他们自己的手中，而要拯救人类免于另一次世界大毁灭，就只有靠他们的活动、力量、斗争性与坚定性。
