Chairman Mao Sent a Telegram!

From 1936 to 1948, Chairman Mao lived in Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region for twelve years. He led the Chinese revolution from the earthen cave dwellings of Yan'an. The peasants of northern Shaanxi said that Chairman Mao was a lucky star because he brought good days to the long-suffering people. Now, Chairman Mao no longer lives in Yan'an, but the peasants, workers, students, staff... everyone in Yan'an still cares about Chairman Mao at all times, and carefully follows Chairman Mao's instructions, as if Chairman Mao still lived next to them.

Last September, when the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held in Beijing, people from all walks of life in Yan'an sent a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao also sent a reply telegram to them on October 26th. Chairman Mao said cordially in the telegram:

"Comrades in Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region:

I am very happy and grateful to receive your congratulatory letter. From 1936 to 1948, Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region were the location of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the general rear area of the Chinese people's liberation struggle. The people of Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have made great contributions to the people of the whole country. I hope that the people of Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region will continue to unite as one, quickly recover from the wounds of war, and develop economic and cultural construction. I also hope that all revolutionary workers throughout the country will always maintain the spirit of hard struggle that the staff in Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region had in the past ten years."

After Chairman Mao's telegram was published in the "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Mass Daily," almost everyone in Yan'an knew about it quickly. Everyone was so happy and excited that the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Regional Party Committee immediately issued a notice requiring cadres at all levels to study Chairman Mao's telegram in depth. The administrative office also instructed all winter schools to make this telegram the first lesson. Yang Buhao, a famous labor hero in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, immediately raised his fist and shouted happily when he learned that Chairman Mao had sent a telegram: "Long live Chairman Mao!" Yang Buhao said: "When Chairman Mao was in Yan'an a few years ago, I often went to see him. Every time he would ask us about the situation of the common people and instruct us to produce well. I haven't seen him for several years now, and we ordinary people are thinking about him all the time. This year, the CPPCC was held and the Central People's Government was established, and he became the Chairman of the government. We really support him very much. On behalf of the common people, I wish him good health!" All the farmers in Yang Buhao's township—that is, the Sixth Township—have been cultivating carefully for the past year, reclaiming more than 3,000 mu of wasteland, and organizing more than 70% of the township's labor force to participate in mutual aid, increasing grain production by more than 700 dan in total, bringing agricultural production back to 90% of the level before the bandits attacked the border area. Yang Buhao said: "Taking advantage of the winter, our village will launch a production competition with the village led by model party member Zhu Jiliang to lay the foundation for the great production campaign in 1950." Lu Zhihan, a farmer in Dabiangou, Yan'an City, said: "I will use the practical action of reclaiming 27 qing of wasteland to respond to Chairman Mao's call."

After studying Chairman Mao's telegram, the Yan'an Power Plant immediately actively prepared all the urgently needed equipment such as high-voltage transformers and transformers, determined to work hard to supply the power for all state-owned factories in Yan'an City in 1950; at the same time, they also prepared to install street lights and electric lights for various agencies and shops in Yan'an City. One can imagine how happy the farmers in the four rural areas will be when the streets and markets of Yan'an City are brightly lit!

After studying Chairman Mao's telegram, the cadres of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Military Region Headquarters, Political Department, Supply Department, and Health Department, under the leadership of Commander Wu Daifeng as director, established a production committee and launched a tree planting campaign. Now, they have planted more than 5,500 trees on the street from the north gate of Yan'an to Dabiangou. After planting the trees, they continued to build this section of the road.

All the officers and soldiers of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Military Region's directly subordinate guard battalion held a meeting to discuss how to implement Chairman Mao's instructions. A squad leader named Fan Zuoqiao said: "We must inherit the spirit of the great production campaign in 1943 and do a good job in the great production campaign in 1950!"

Chairman Mao's words in the telegram also encouraged those who had lost their legs or arms for the revolution. Honorary soldiers Sun Keming, Feng Baoshan, Shen Sigong, Li Changyuan, and Ma Weixin, after studying Chairman Mao's telegram, all said in unison: "Although our bodies are disabled, our spirit and our thoughts are still very healthy under the cultivation of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party!" They expressed their willingness to work hard to study culture and serve the people's construction cause.

A few days after Chairman Mao's telegram was published, on the morning of November 1st, the children living in the Second Bao Primary School in Yangjialing ran and jumped to the playground to listen to their Director Yao's speech. Director Yao asked bluntly: "What place do we live in?" The children answered in unison: "Yangjialing!" Director Yao asked again: "Who used to live in Yangjialing?" The children answered again together: "Chairman Mao!" At this time, Director Yao began to read Chairman Mao's telegram, reading a section and explaining a section. In the end, the children all shouted happily: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "We must study hard!" "Learn the hard-struggle style of our parents!" "Cherish the place where Chairman Mao lived!" The children were not just talking. They had been doing this all along: When they first came to Yangjialing in 1948, all the doors and windows of the cave dwellings were burned by the bandits, the weeds were five feet high, and the ground was full of human and animal manure. However, four months later, with the help of the People's Government and the labor of the children, the cave dwellings had been installed with doors and windows, the weeds and manure had been cleared, and a five-foot-high wall had been built around. This is also a small example of the people of Yan'an implementing Chairman Mao's instruction to "recover from the wounds of war." When celebrating the Gregorian New Year last year, the farmers in Zaoyuan Village, who had been Chairman Mao's neighbors in northern Shaanxi for many years, recalled the glorious story of Chairman Mao hosting a banquet to celebrate his 60th birthday five or six years ago. He said: "When Chairman Mao was here, he would send us New Year's cards and invite us to dinner every year during the holidays. Now, although he is thousands of miles away from us, he still thinks about sending us telegrams. How can people not miss him!" The farmers in Zaoyuan have been actively preparing for production in 1950 since last winter. They have collected more than 300 dan of manure, and each household has also chopped more than ten loads of firewood. They said: "We know that Chairman Mao is most concerned about the production of us ordinary people."

Last December, Yang Buhao set off from Yan'an with 14 jin of honey sugar, 3 sheng of melon seeds, and a production report written by the people of his entire township to Chairman Mao, preparing to go to Beijing to personally visit Chairman Mao. However, when he arrived in Xi'an at the end of the year, Chairman Mao had just left for the Soviet Union. He had to leave the gifts in Xi'an and ask someone to forward them to Chairman Mao in the future. What he brought to Chairman Mao was not his personal friendship, but the friendship of the entire Yan'an and the entire Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia people.

### 毛主席打来电报了！

    毛主席打来电报了！
    从一九三六年到一九四八年，毛主席在延安和陕甘宁边区一住住了十二年，他在延安的土窑洞里领导着中国的革命，陕北的农民说毛主席是福星，因为他给多年来受苦受难的老百姓带来了好日子。现在，毛主席不住在延安了，延安的农民、工人、学生、工作人员……所有一切的人仍旧是时时刻刻关心着毛主席，仔仔细细地按照毛主席的指示办事情，就好像毛主席还是住在他们的旁边一样。
    去年九月间，中国人民政治协商会议在北京开会的时候，延安党政军民各界给毛主席发了一个庆贺的电报，毛主席在十月二十六号也拍了一个回电给他们。毛主席在电报里头亲切地说：
    “延安的同志们和陕甘宁边区的同志们：
    接到你们的贺函，使我十分愉快和感谢，延安和陕甘宁边区，从一九三六年到一九四八年，曾经是中共中央的所在地，曾经是中国人民解放斗争的总后方，延安和陕甘宁边区的人民，对于全国人民是有伟大贡献的。我希望延安和陕甘宁边区的人民继续团结一致，迅速恢复战争的创伤，发展经济建设和文化建设。我并且希望，全国一切革命工作人员，永远保持过去十余年间在延安和陕甘宁边区的工作人员中所具有的艰苦奋斗的作风。”
    毛主席的这个电报，在陕北群众日报上一登出来以后，所有的延安人，差不多很快都知道了，大家真是又快乐又兴奋，陕北区党委立刻就发出通知，要各级干部深入学习毛主席的电文。行署也指示各地冬学要把这个电文做为第一课。陕甘宁边区著名的劳动英雄杨步浩，知道毛主席打来了电报，马上高兴的举起拳头高呼：“毛主席万岁！”杨步浩说：“前几年毛主席在延安的时候，我常去看他，每次他都要问我们老百姓过光景的情形，指示我们要好好生产，到如今好几年都没见他老人家的面了，我们老百姓时时刻刻在惦念着他。今年开政协会，成立中央人民政府，他又当了政府的主席，我们实在拥护的很，我代表老百姓祝他健康！”杨步浩的那一乡——就是第六乡的全体农民，一年来精耕细作，开荒三千多亩，组织全乡劳力百分之七十以上参加变工，一共增产粮食七百多石，使农业生产恢复到胡匪没有打到边区以前水平的百分之九十。杨步浩说：“趁着冬天，我们村要和模范党员朱继亮领导的村子展开生产竞赛，好为一九五○年的大生产运动打下基础。”延安市大砭沟的农民陆志汉说：“我要用开荒二十七垧的实际行动来响应毛主席的号召。”
    延安动力厂在学习过毛主席的电文以后，便马上积极准备高压器、变压器等一切极需用的器材，决心为一九五○年供应延安市各公营工厂的电动力而努力；同时他们还准备装置延安市的路灯和各机关、各商店的电灯。人们可以想到，当延安城的街道和市场上电灯大放光明的时候，四乡的农民会多么高兴啊！
    陕北军区司令部、政治部、供给部和卫生部的干部，在学习毛主席的电文以后，由吴岱峰司令员作主任，成立生产委员会，展开了栽树运动，现在，从延安北门外到大砭沟的街道上，已经由他们栽好了五千五百多棵树。栽完了树，他们又接着修筑这一段马路。
    陕北军区直属警卫营的全体指战员，开了一个会，讨论怎么样执行毛主席的指示，一个名叫樊作桥的班长说：“咱们要继承一九四三年大生产运动的精神，搞好一九五○年的大生产！”
    毛主席在电报里面的话，也鼓舞了那些为革命断了腿，断了胳臂的人。荣誉军人孙克明、冯宝山、申思恭、李长元、和马维新等，在学习过毛主席的电报以后，都一致地说：“我们的身体虽然残废了，但是我们的精神，我们的思想，在毛主席和共产党的培育下，还是很健康！”他们表示：愿意努力学习文化，为人民建设事业服务。
    在毛主席的电文公布以后，过了几天，就是在十一月一号的上午，住在杨家岭第二保小的孩子们跑着跳着集合到操场上去听他们姚主任的讲话。姚主任劈头就问：“咱们住的是什么地方？”孩子们一齐回答：“杨家岭！”姚主任又问：“杨家岭过去是谁住的？”孩子们又一起回答：“毛主席！”这时候，姚主任就开始念毛主席的电文，念一段，讲一段，到最后孩子们都高兴的喊了起来：“毛主席万岁！”“我们要好好学习！”“学习爸爸妈妈艰苦奋斗的作风！”“爱护毛主席住过的地方！”孩子们并不是空口白说，他们过去一直就是按照这样做的：当他们一九四八年刚来到杨家岭的时候，所有窑洞的门窗都叫胡匪烧光了，蒿草有五尺高，满地是人粪牲口粪，但是在四个月以后，由于人民政府的帮助和小朋友们的劳动，窑洞已经安上了门窗，蒿草和粪便都被清除了，四周还打起一条五尺高的围墙。这也是延安人执行毛主席的指示“恢复战争创伤”的一个小小的例子。今年过阳历年的时候，毛主席在陕北多年的邻居——枣园村的农民们都回忆开了，六十二岁的谢登征对别人讲毛主席在五六年以前，为他设宴祝寿的光荣故事，他说：“毛主席在的时候，年年过节都要给我们送贺年片，请我们吃饭，如今他虽然离开咱们上千里的路程，还想着给咱们拍来电报，怎叫人不想念他！”枣园的农民们，从去年冬天起，就积极进行一九五○年生产的准备工作，他们掊了三百多担粪，每家还砍了十多背柴，他们说：“我们知道，毛主席最关心的就是咱们老百姓的生产。”
    去年十二月间，杨步浩从延安出发，带了蜂糖十四斤，瓜子三升和他们全乡人民写给毛主席的生产报告，准备到北京去亲自看望毛主席。可是，等他年底走到西安的时候，毛主席刚好动身去苏联了，他只得把礼物留在西安，托人等将来转交给毛主席。他带给毛主席的，不是他一个人的情谊，而是全延安，全陕甘宁人民的情谊。
