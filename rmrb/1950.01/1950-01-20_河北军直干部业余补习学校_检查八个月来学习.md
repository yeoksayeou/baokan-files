Hebei Military District Direct Unit Cadre Spare-Time Cultural Tutoring School
Inspects Eight Months of Learning

[This newspaper’s dispatch] In order to inspect the learning situation of the past eight months, the Hebei Military District Direct Unit Cadre Spare-Time Cultural Tutoring School held year-end tests in mid-December last year. At the same time, students were mobilized to mutually evaluate their academic performance and learning attitude, and to offer opinions on teaching methods and school leadership. According to the results of the inspection and evaluation, the school has achieved considerable success in the past eight months. More than 90% of the students have established a correct learning attitude, and there are very few cases of absenteeism without reason. Students who are away on official business request make-up classes and exams upon their return. Many people not only listen attentively in class, but also seize their spare time outside of class to do homework and practice. The students' cultural level has improved one step further. The Chinese language test scores of each class are all above 70 points. The lowest-level arithmetic class has progressed from recognizing Arabic numerals to learning addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The highest-level class, starting from fractions, has seen over 90% of the students learn how to calculate square roots and direct/inverse proportions. In addition, each class has studied a portion of current affairs policies and social development history.

The achievement of these results is inseparable from the timely supervision and inspection by the leadership. The Military District Commander personally mobilized and encouraged students to study, and visited the spare-time school several times to inspect, instructing the headquarters to leave fewer duty personnel and have them all participate in learning. This had a great impact on the students.

The main experiences and lessons learned in the past eight months are as follows:

(1) Qualified teachers are an important condition for running a good spare-time tutoring school. The school's method of solving the problem of teachers is to, on the one hand, hire capable teachers through investigation and understanding by the leadership, and on the other hand, to regularly hold teacher joint meetings to study teaching methods and improve teaching efficiency. At present, because most teachers are part-time and do not have more time to understand the students' situation, it is difficult for teaching to be practical. Moreover, there is a bias: more lecturing, less homework and review. Both teachers and students have a mentality of seeking quick results, forming a situation where there is lecturing in every class, but no time for review after lecturing, resulting in trying to cover too much without digesting it.

(2) Determine the school system and strictly organize classes. It is very difficult to determine the cultural level of office cadres. Their educational background is different, and the degree of self-study is different. Moreover, they used to have the habit of attending large classes, and some people are always willing to go to higher-level classes. In the past eight months, the school has adjusted the classes three times. The method of organizing classes is a combination of three aspects: mobilizing students to declare their level, soliciting opinions from the administrative leaders of the units where the students are located, and the results of the tests. Finally, the academic affairs office makes the decision. After each class organization, due to the continuous transfer and absence of cadres, the level of students in the class has changed again. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct frequent tests, understand the situation, and carry out persuasive education, so that students consciously go to suitable classes or re-evaluate and adjust. At the same time, to grasp the class organization standards and carry out teaching in a planned manner, it is first necessary to have clear school system standards as a basis. The school has not yet completely solved the school system problem. Although it has roughly determined that primary school should last for two years, higher primary school for one year, and junior high school for one and a half years; but where should the primary school curriculum go? Where should higher primary school and junior high school go? How to divide the learning stages in each level? It has never been certain, which also makes teaching and class organization difficult.

(3) In terms of management and leadership in learning, experience has proven that although the vast majority of cadres can consciously abide by discipline, there are always a few people who are not self-disciplined enough. It is necessary to establish a set of management systems. In order to ensure the implementation of these systems, the establishment of the system should absorb students' opinions, explain the principles to everyone after it is formulated, and supervise each other to comply. At the same time, it should maintain close contact with the administrative and Party leadership of the various cadres' institutions, exchange information with each other, jointly supervise and inspect, and pay attention to encouragement and criticism. In leading students' learning, it is very important to pay attention to students' homework. The requirements for homework should grasp the principle of "less but refined," practice repeatedly to achieve thorough understanding and learn to apply. In the case where part-time teachers do not have enough time to correct all students' homework, mutual aid groups should be established or a "little teacher" system should be established, with teachers randomly reviewing a portion of the homework, writing out standard answers, and the mutual aid group being responsible for correcting the rest.

    河北军直干部业余补习学校
    检查八个月来学习
    【本报讯】为检查八个月来的学习情况，河北省军区直属队干部业余文化补习学校于去年十二月中旬举行了年关测验，同时发动学员互相评定学习成绩、学习态度并对教学方法与学校领导提出意见。根据检查评议的结果看，八个月来该校已获得相当成绩。百分之九十以上的学员已树立了正确的学习态度，无故旷课者极少；学员因公外出的，回来后要求补课补考；很多人不仅在课堂上专心听讲，在课外仍抓紧公余时间进行作业练习。学员的文化程度已提高一步，各班国文测验成绩均在七十分以上；算术最低班已由认亚拉伯字码起学会了加减乘除法；最高班由分数开始，百分之九十以上学员学会了开方和正反比例。此外，各班均学习了一部分时事政策和社会发展史。
    这些成绩的获得，和领导上的及时督促检查分不开。军区司令员亲自动员鼓励学员学习，几次到业余学校检查，并指示司令部少留值班人员，都去参加学习。对学员影响很大。
    八个月来的经验教训，主要有下列几点：
    （一）称职的师资是办好业余补习学校的重要条件。该校解决师资的办法，一面是经过调查了解，由领导上去聘请得力教员；一面常开教员联席会，研究教学方法，提高教学效率。目前因教员多系兼职，没有更多的时间去了解学员的情况，教学上很难切合实际。而且有一个偏向：讲课多，作业与复习少，教员与学员都有急于求成的思想，形成上课必讲，讲后没有时间复习，贪多不化。
    （二）确定学制，严格编班。机关干部文化程度的高低很不容易确定，学历不同，自修程度不同；而且过去又有上大课的习惯，总有一些人愿到高一些的班级去。八个月中，该校曾经三次调整班级，编班的方法，是动员学员自报、征求学员所在单位行政领导方面的意见与测验的结果三方面结合，最后由教务处作决定。每次编班之后，由于干部不断调动与外出，不久班内学员程度又起了变化，这就必须经常测验了解与说服教育，使学员自觉地到适合的班次里去或再加评定调整。同时，要掌握编班标准与有计划地进行教学，首先必须有明确的学制标准为依据，该校对学制问题尚未完满解决，虽然大致上确定初小二年、高小一年、初中一年半毕业；但初小课程应进行到那里？高小、初中又应进行到那里？各级中学习阶段的划分标准如何？始终未肯定，这也使教学与编班发生困难。
    （三）在管理与领导学习方面，经验证明：虽然绝大多数干部能自觉遵守纪律，但总有少数人自觉精神不够，建立一套管理制度是必要的，为了保证这些制度的执行，订立制度应吸收学员意见，订成后要向大家说明道理，互相监督遵守；同时，应与各干部所在机关的行政与党的领导方面密切联系，互相交换情况，共同督促检查，注意鼓励与批评。在领导学员学习上，注意学员作业是很重要的，作业的要求应掌握少而精的原则，反复多练，达到彻底了解与学会运用的目的。在兼课教员没有足够时间全部批改学员作业的情况下，应通过互助小组或建立小先生制，由教员抽阅一部作业，写出标准答案，由互助组来负责订正。
