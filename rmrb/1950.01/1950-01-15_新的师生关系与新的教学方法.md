    New Teacher-Student Relationship and New Teaching Methods
    Xiao Sen, Peking University College of Engineering

    Since liberation, the faculty and students of Peking University's College of Engineering have made progress in their thinking. Not long after classes began this semester, the Department of Mechanical Engineering, under the leadership of the administration, launched a movement for professors and teaching assistants to visit students in their dormitories. This not only solved students' problems with their courses, but also established a close relationship between professors and students. Students could provide feedback on professors' teaching methods at any time, and professors could improve textbooks or teaching plans to better suit students' needs. For example, Professor Cheng Hong gave a focused explanation and discussion in the student dormitory after each stage of the steam turbine lectures. Through discussions, every student gained a deeper understanding, and even students who had not paid much attention to the course were moved by the professor's enthusiasm and worked harder. Another example is that the students in Mechanical Engineering IV overly emphasized theory, so Professor Li Xishan addressed this shortcoming by urging students to memorize numbers and use slide rules as much as possible. Before and after lectures, he also took students to factories to do practical load and mechanical mechanism analysis, so that students could combine practical observation with theory. In Tooling, another course for Mechanical Engineering IV, lectures used to involve drawing on the blackboard, which was both a waste of time and unclear. After students suggested changes, the course was taught using slides, which not only saved a lot of time but also made students more interested in the course.
    After the teacher-student relationship in the Department of Mechanical Engineering improved, students' learning made significant progress. The Departments of Electrical Engineering, Architecture, Civil Engineering, and Chemistry followed suit and launched similar movements. For example, in Calculus for the Electrical Engineering program, initially everyone was afraid to ask the professor questions, and the professor did not understand the students' difficulties, only subjectively following their own plan. After improving the teacher-student relationship, students offered suggestions, and the professor proactively changed the teaching method to achieve a true integration of teaching and learning. Teaching assistant Li Xuezhi also played a bridging role between the professor and students. After the Electronic Engineering course for Electrical Engineering III was completed, Li Xuezhi proactively found students to discuss the key points of the course, resulting in better grades for the entire class.
    The teacher-student relationship in the Department of Architecture was good before, but it was only based on emotion and was not utilized in the courses. After a review by Department Chair Zhu Zhaoxue, various professors, teaching assistants, and all the students in the department, Director Zhu believed that lecturing in the classroom alone was not enough. So, he added an hour of free explanation to the course schedule, where students could freely raise questions about the course, which Director Zhu would answer. The teaching methods of various professors were also improved after students offered suggestions. In addition to theoretical courses lectured in the classroom, students were also led to visit major hotels or other famous buildings in the city. During the summer vacation, under the leadership of Professor Li Songchen, students directly participated in surveying in the four suburbs and construction projects in the new urban area. Design topics were also more realistic than before, mostly assuming the construction of a certain building on a vacant lot in Beijing, so that students could make reasonable designs based on current practical needs. Furthermore, architectural designs were subject to mutual criticism by students and professors. After this teaching method was implemented, the design results improved significantly, and students absorbed the strengths of each professor. When professors were not enthusiastic enough during political class discussions, students suggested that professors and teaching assistants participate in student groups to achieve "mutual assistance between teachers and students, and mutual growth in teaching and learning."
    Yuan Hanqing, the director of the Department of Chemistry, went to the student dormitory to solve students' learning problems, and did not return until late at night. The students asked him to stay there, and the next morning, Director Yuan was reluctant to leave. In the Chemical Engineering Principles course for Chemistry III, everyone was clueless at the first class. Thanks to teaching assistant Liu Pinshuang's proactive explanations for the students and suggestions for the professor, all difficulties were resolved. Civil Engineering professors taught the materials in conjunction with the practical needs of China. Professor Zhang Wu's Hydropower not only lectured in the classroom but also took students to listen to special reports at water conservancy conferences. Professor Jin Tao of Railway Engineering also combined the theory of the textbook with the actual situation of Chinese railways. Professor Chen Shihua's lectures on river management were linked to the main task of water conservancy in China, which is to prevent river flooding, and he clarified the importance of saving and disaster relief.
    After the teacher-student relationship improved, the obstacles to student learning and professor lecturing at Peking University's College of Engineering were greatly reduced. Now everyone is working hard to "reform the content and teaching methods of the old education system with an educational method that unifies theory and practice."

    新的师生关系与新的教学方法
    北大工学院  萧森
    解放以后，北大工院师生在思想上都提高了一步。本学期上课不久，机械系便在行政的领导下展开了教授、助教到宿舍访问学生的运动，不但把学生在课程上的问题解决了，并且使教授和学生间有了密切关系，教授教法不好，同学可以随时提供意见，教材或教学计划不适合学生的需要，教授也可以尽量改善。例如程宏教授每当汽轮机讲授到一个阶段时，便到学生宿舍做一重点的讲解及讨论。经过讨论后，使每一位同学有了更深刻的了解，部分对这门课程不重视的同学，也因受到教授热情的感动而更加努力。再如机四的同学过于重视理论，李西山教授便针对这一缺点督促同学尽量记数字、拉计算尺。在讲课前后，更带同学到工厂做实际载荷及机械机构的分析，使学生从实际的观察与理论得到配合。再如机四的工具学，过去讲课是在黑板上画图，既浪费时间又不清楚，经过同学提意见后，改用幻灯讲授，不但节省了很多的时间，并使同学对这门课程发生了更大的兴趣。
    机系师生关系搞好后，同学的学习有了显著的进步。电机、建筑、土木、化学各系便也随着展开了这一运动。例如电专的微积分，起初大家有问题也不敢找教授去问，教授也不了解同学的困难，只主观的按自己的计划进行。在搞好师生关系后，同学提出了意见，教授便主动地改换了教授法，做到教与学真正的配合。助教李学智也发挥了教授与同学间的桥梁作用，电三电子学讲完后，李助教主动地找同学一起讨论课程的重点，使全班同学得到更好的成绩。
    建筑系的师生关系，以前就很好，但只是建立在感情上，没有利用到课程上来。经朱兆雪系主任、各位教授、助教以及全系同学的检讨，朱主任认为只在课堂上讲授是不够的，于是在课程表上添了一个钟头的自由解说，同学随意提出课程上的问题，由朱主任解答。各位教授的教授法经同学提供意见后，也改善了，除了在课堂上讲授的理论课程外，并领导同学到市内各大饭店或其他著名建筑地参观。暑假期间，并由李颂琛教授领导，直接参加了四郊测量与新市区建筑工程。设计题目也比以前合乎现实，多半假定北京城内的某个空地建筑某项房屋，使同学能根据目前实际需要，做合理的设计，并且建筑设计也做到同学教授互相批评，这一教授法施行后，设计的成绩有了很大的进步，并且使同学吸收了每位教授的优点。上政治课教授们讨论的时候不太热烈，同学便提意见要求教授、助教参加到同学的小组里来，做到了“师生互助，教学相长”。
    化学系袁翰青主任到学生宿舍去为同学解决学习上的问题，深夜还不回去，同学便留他住在那里，第二天早晨，袁主任还恋恋不舍的不愿意走。化三的化工原理在初次上课的时候，大家都摸不着头脑，由于助教刘品双主动的替同学解说，和替教授提供意见，把一切困难都解决了，土木系教授讲授材料结合中国实际的需要，张伍教授的水利发电，不但在课堂上讲，并且带同学听水利会议的专题报告。铁路工程的金涛教授也把课本的理论与中国铁路实际情形结合起来。陈士骅教授讲授治河联系到中国水利的主要任务在防止河流泛滥，并阐明了节约救灾的重要性。
    师生关系搞好后，北大工学院同学学习和教授讲授上的障碍大大减少。现在大家都正为“以理论与实际一致的教育方法，改革旧的教育制度内容和教学法”而努力。
