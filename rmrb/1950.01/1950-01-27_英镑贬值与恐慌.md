    Sterling Devaluation and Panic
    By Francis, translated by Wang Zhihuan
    This essay clearly explains the class nature of sterling devaluation: on the one hand, it enables capitalists to obtain super-profits, and on the other hand, it reduces the living standards of workers. At the same time, this article explains why the United States opposed sterling devaluation in 1931 but supported it in 1949. Editor
    The devaluation of the pound must be regarded as a new sign of the deterioration of Britain's position in the world capitalist crisis. To say that sterling devaluation is a remedy for Britain's foreign trade crisis or a way to prevent impending unemployment is hypocritical nonsense.
    The trick of devaluation is now well known. Reducing the exchange rate from $4.03 to $2.80 per pound means cutting the price of British exports – in dollar terms – by 30 percent. This means that our exports to the dollar area must increase by 44 percent (not 30%) in order to earn the same amount of dollars as before. So in fact we have to increase exports substantially in order to exchange for the same amount of imports as before. From another perspective, the value of British exporters' goods in terms of gold pounds is the same, but importers have to pay 44% more in pound equivalents when buying dollar goods. These two changes – the reduction in the price of our exports in dollar terms and the increase in the price of our imports in pound terms – are two sides of the same coin, not two separate results added together. The main result is that we have to increase exports to exchange for the same amount of food and raw materials.
    Many other countries have devalued against the dollar to the same extent as Britain, so our trade with them is not affected. Some other countries, which are very important to our trade, have not devalued as much as we have, so the impact on our trade is considerable, but not as great as the impact on our trade with the United States. Canada, France, and Belgium are examples of this.
    The reason given by the Labour government for sterling devaluation is that our exports to the dollar area began to decline sharply in the second quarter of 1949, and gold and dollar reserves were rapidly reduced because they were used to pay for most of the dollar goods imports. This is true, but it omits – deliberately – the dominant position of American imperialists.
    The financial and military strategists in Washington decided to do three things: 1. create profitable areas for foreign investment; 2. tear down trade barriers and open up markets for America's increasing surplus goods; 3. completely subjugate Europe politically and economically in preparation for war against the Soviet Union. The devaluation of the pound – the dollar's biggest rival in the capitalist world – is a strategic goal of these three plans; we will see this clearly later.
    The attack on the pound has been launched. Spokesmen for American imperialism began to speak openly of "exchange rate adjustments," making it clear which currency they had in mind. The world's perception of Britain's independence is such that many of Britain's foreign customers suppressed their orders – despite Cripps' posturing – waiting for the pound to devalue, at which point they would benefit from lower prices, because they understand that what Washington says today, the Labour government will do tomorrow. This created another gap in Britain's export front, which was already collapsing in the American market. As exports were cut back, Britain's reserves flowed out rapidly.
    The American imperialist gang then began to exert direct pressure, and powerful financiers landed at London Airport, passing through to Whitehall. According to all accounts, they met with little resistance, and the right-wing Labour government accepted the noose as a grim but fashionable necklace for the British people.
    One Sunday in September, the government put on serious faces and announced this shameful act of surrender, spreading lies that this was "another stage in our people's heroic struggle." In fact, it was a moment of suffering for the British people – made all the more so because they were confused and led astray by the government. This government played the role of social democrats, concealing the issue of class struggle from the people, and spreading lies about "cheering up!" and "tightening our belts."
    The openly stated aim of the right-wing Labour government for sterling devaluation is: 1. to reduce our goods prices in the dollar area so that we can sell more, earn more dollars, and narrow the gap between exports and imports. 2. To prevent large-scale unemployment. They admitted that this would mean a reduction in the living standards of the working class and the middle class. First, because the cost of living will increase due to the rising prices of imported goods. Secondly, because they hope that Britain will increase exports of more goods, which will reduce the quantity of goods available domestically. They, as usual, want the workers to work harder and consume less.
    It is easy to see that sterling devaluation is a serious reduction in living standards. Undoubtedly, Cripps underestimated the extent of the rise in the cost of living, which in the next few months is unlikely to be less than one shilling per pound. The "Economist" believes it will be twice this. Our raw material imports, such as rubber and non-ferrous metals, have already risen in price. Timber from Canada will be more expensive, as will imported steel. In addition, the government intends to cut imports by 25 percent.
    What about the capitalists? Sterling devaluation means greater profits for export industries, and, due to the general rise in domestic prices, industries producing for the domestic market will also obtain greater profits. In the latter case, the increase in profits is generated as follows: if the increased price of raw materials used to produce each unit of goods is ten pence, the capitalist can easily add one shilling to the selling price. If regulations stipulate that profits are a percentage of cost, the increase in cost automatically increases the amount of profit. But the capitalists hope to increase profits the most in the export market.
    Here, we are still assuming that capitalists will keep export prices at the old level. In reality, this is not the case. For example, according to a report in the Financial Times on September 27, 1949, the Anglia Ford car, which sold for $1,420 (355 pounds) before devaluation, now sells for $1,170 (418 pounds at the new rate). Therefore, for a certain group of capitalists, sterling devaluation is equivalent to earning 63 pounds more per car – an increase of 18 percent.
    This is not an isolated example, but something that is happening in almost every export industry. Capitalist exporters have the opportunity to raise their prices in many markets, so the final price in foreign currency is lower than before sterling devaluation, but not as low as the equivalent extent of sterling devaluation.
    It is roughly correct to say that the price of British exports (in dollar terms) will fall, not by 30 percent, but only by about 15 percent, and the excess will become the super-profits of British capitalist exporters.
    There is nothing more revealing of the vicious class nature of sterling devaluation: super-profits for capitalists, wage freezes and rising prices for workers. When Cripps devalued the pound, it was not patriotism, nor was it to promote exports to the dollar area to make up for the dollar "shortage," but the Labour government's promise to give capitalists the opportunity to obtain super-profits. The financial editor of The Times (September 28, 1949) made this clear when he wrote that "exports to the sterling and soft currency areas are highly profitable" and, after complaining about the extra profits tax announced by Cripps, concluded: "There is ample evidence that a stimulus is still needed to induce many companies to switch from favorable sterling markets to the dollar area." Of course, the stimulus needed is higher profits, and that is exactly what they got.
    The profits that exporters make by increasing prices by 15 to 20 percent are insignificant compared to the 5 percent tax on distributed profits. This proves that sterling devaluation is very beneficial to them.
    The famous economist Hawtrey wrote in a letter to The Times: "Super-profits will not be limited to exports to the dollar area; super-profits can also be obtained on exports that compete with dollar countries' exports in various places, and on domestic products that compete with goods imported from dollar countries." And, "When the waves of price and wage (?) increases spread to the countries that have devalued their currencies, exports to these countries will also begin to obtain super-profits."
    In order to divert the workers' attention from the facts of declining real wages and rising profits, the Labour government claimed that sterling devaluation was the only way to avoid unemployment, and their entire argument, or devout hope, was placed on sterling devaluation would greatly increase exports.
    According to an estimate in the "Economist" on September 24, 1949, even with a 25 percent cut in population, Britain must now increase its exports to the dollar area by at least 144 percent to make up for the dollar shortage. If the pound had not been devalued, only half this increase would have been needed. Not only Britain, but many other countries in Europe will also attempt to sell two and a half to three times more goods to the United States than in the past. These huge extra commodities are to be peddled in a shrinking market where American capitalists themselves are finding it increasingly difficult to sell.
    This is the real situation behind the arrogant promises given by the likes of Cripps and Wilson. Britain, or any other country, has no chance of achieving such a huge increase in exports. Sterling devaluation reduces the amount of imports we get in exchange for our exports to the dollar area, which makes us more dependent on exports to the imperialist, crisis-ridden United States. Sterling devaluation makes British workers' jobs even more dependent on the conditions of the imperialist, crisis-ridden United States. This is not a way to avoid unemployment, but to ensure that there will be unemployment.
    In 1931, the then Labour Prime Minister MacDonald, along with a group of traitors to the labor movement, fully cooperated with the Conservatives in the "National" government. At that time, just as now, the "threat to the pound" became an excuse to reduce workers' real wages through sterling devaluation. Two Labour historians, in writing that period of history, said: "When the same effect on costs (i.e. workers' purchasing power) can be achieved more easily by sterling devaluation, there is little point in reducing wages..." (Cole and Postgate: "The Common People")
    The economic situation at the time of the 1931 sterling devaluation was different from today. First, at that time the economic crisis had already occurred, and there was a lot of unemployment, while today the crisis has not yet reached Britain, and full unemployment is still relatively low. Secondly, world prices were falling sharply at that time, while now prices have remained stable or are rising. The 1931 sterling devaluation prevented workers from benefiting from the fall in world food prices, which they could have obtained. The 1949 sterling devaluation will increase the cost of living and directly reduce real wages. Third, the 1931 sterling devaluation was opposed by American capitalists, who at the time feared that cheap British exports would compete with them.
    What did the 1931 sterling devaluation accomplish? All the evidence proves that it did not increase exports, nor did it prevent unemployment from increasing. In the two years before the sterling devaluation, British exports fell sharply by 37 percent, and in the two years after the devaluation, exports neither rose nor fell. And in the next four years (1933-1937), exports only climbed to a level that was still 21 percent lower than in 1929. The increase or decrease in British exports in the 1930s was almost entirely in line with the pace of world trade, and there was no sign that sterling devaluation had any benefits.
    The unemployment record is even worse. Unemployment in the year after the sterling devaluation (1932) was the highest on record, 5 percent higher than in 1931. Unemployment in 1932 was so severe that an average of one in five workers was unemployed. In the shipbuilding industry, three out of five workers were unemployed; in the steel industry, almost one out of every two workers was unemployed; and in the coal mining industry, two out of every five workers were unemployed. This is the terrible record of British capitalism one year after sterling devaluation. From 1931, it took six years to cut the average unemployment figure in half to one out of every ten workers unemployed.
    In comparing the two sterling devaluations in 1931 and 1949, the key question is: why did American imperialism oppose it then, but support it now? The answer cannot be found in the comparison of the prices of British and American goods (as bourgeois economists try to show). The answer can only be found in the development of the struggle between British and American imperialism and in the American imperialists' war plans against the democratic camp. As the American domestic economic crisis develops, the huge surplus value accumulated during wartime and post-war prosperity is looking for more favorable investments abroad. So far, the capital exports of American private investors (as distinct from the American federal government) have been relatively small, but the pressure is growing. American capitalists are looking for cheap labor to exploit, and for guarantees that they will not be nationalized. Currency devaluation, by reducing the living standards of workers in many countries and reducing the price of labor in dollar terms, directly achieves the first purpose.
    On the other hand, American manufacturers are also looking for markets for their increasing surplus goods. The British Empire, with its preferential tariffs and currency transactions tightly controlled by the City of London, has always been an obstacle to American capitalists seeking world markets. Sterling devaluation is a not-so-narrow crack. Washington is using pressure to force Britain to accept free convertibility of the pound, abandon bilateral trade and long-term food contracts, that is, abandon all controls and defenses, and allow American goods to flood Britain's export market unhindered. This serious blow to British imperialism was only accepted with the understanding that sterling devaluation would give British monopoly capitalists super-profits.

    英镑贬值与恐慌
    佛兰希斯著  王知还译
    关于英镑贬值的阶级性，这篇论文讲得很明白：一方面是使资本家获得超额利润，另一方面是使工人的生活水平降低。同时，此文又解说为什么美国在一九三一年反对英镑贬值，而在一九四九年却又赞成英镑贬值。					  编者
    英镑之贬值，必须认为是英国在世界资本主义危机中的地位恶化的新征兆。说英镑贬值是对英国国外贸易危机的一种补救，或是对终要来临的失业的一种防止办法，都是虚伪的废话。
    贬值的把戏到现在已颇为众所周知了。将比值从四·○三美元减到二·八○美元对一镑，就是将英国输出品价格——以美元计——削减了百分之三十。这就是说，我们向美元区的出口量必须增加百分之四十四，（不是三○％）才能赚回与以前同样数目的美元。所以实际上我们必须大量增加输出，以便换取与以前同量的输入。从另外一个角度来看，英国出口商输出其商品所得价值按金镑算是相同的，但入口商在购买美元货物时，却要多付四四％的英镑之等值。这两种变化——以美元计算我们出口品价格的降低，与以英镑计算我们入口品价格的增涨——乃是一件事的两面，而不是两个分开的结果加在一起。其主要结果就是我们必须增加输出以换取同等数量的粮食及原料。
    有许多别的国家也与英国同样程度地对美元贬值，所以我们与它们之间的贸易并不受影响。另有一些对我们贸易很重要的国家，贬值不像我们这样多，所以对我们贸易的影响颇大，但不像对我们与美国贸易的影响那么大。加拿大法国，比利时，就是这样的例子。
    工党政府所提出的英镑贬值理由是：我们对美元区的输出在一九四九年第二季已开始剧烈下降，而黄金及美元的准备，也因用以支付美元货输入的大部，而迅速减少。这是实情，但它遗漏了——故意地——美国帝国主义者的支配地位。
    华盛顿的一帮金融及军事战略家决定要作三件事：一，创造有利可图的国外投资区域；二，打倒贸易壁垒及开辟对美国日益增加的过剩商品的市场；三，使欧洲在政治、经济上完全屈服，以准备对苏战争。英镑——在资本主义世界中美元的最大劲敌——之贬值是这三个计划的战略目标；这一点我们在后面就将看清楚。
    对英镑的进攻是发动了。美帝国主义的发言人开始公开谈论着“汇率的调整”，使人一目了然他们心目中所指的是哪一种货币。世界对英国的独立性是如此认识，以致英国的许多国外主顾压下了订货单——尽管克利浦斯在装腔作势，——待英镑贬值之后，价格跌低，他们有利可得，因为他们了解华盛顿今天说什么，工党政府明天就会作什么。这就使已在暴跌的美国市场上败退的英国输出战线，更多了一个缺口。出口削减，英国的准备金就跟着急剧的流出了。
    美国帝国主义者匪帮这时就开始施用直接压力，权力广大的金融家就降落在伦敦飞机场，过路到白厅去。据一切消息显示，他们遭到很少抵抗，右翼工党政府就将绞绳圈接受作为英国人民的严峻的、但时髦的项链。
    九月的一个星期日，政府摆起严重的脸孔，宣布这一可耻的投降行动，并大撒其谎，说这是“我国人民雄壮斗争中的另一阶段。”实际上那是英国人民苦难的一刻——因为他们被政府所混淆，所导入歧途，而更加是如此。这个政府尽了社会民主党的作用，向人民掩蔽阶级斗争的问题，散布着“振奋起来！”及“勒紧我们的裤带”的谎话。
    右翼工党政府对英镑贬值所公开声称的目的是：一、在美元区减低我们的货价，以便能售得更多，多赚美元，缩小输出与输入间的差额。二，防止大规模的失业。他们承认这将意味着工人阶级与中产阶级生活水平的降低。首先，因为生活费用将因进口货涨价而增高。其次，因为他们希望英国增加输出的更多货物，这将减少国内所能有的物品数量。他们照例是要工人们工作得再吃力些，消费得更少些。
    很容易看出英镑贬值，就是严重的削低生活水平。无疑的，克利浦斯对生活费用的涨价程度估计得是过低，在下几个月中，涨得不见得会少于每镑涨一先令。“经济学家”认为将两倍于此。我们的原料进口，如橡皮及非铁金属，已经涨价了。从加拿大来的木材将要更贵，输入的钢也会一样。除此以外，政府还打算把输入削减百分之二十五。
    资本家怎么样呢？英镑贬值意味着出口工业的更大利润，而且，由于国内价格的普遍上涨，为国内市场而生产的各工业也将获得更大的利润。在后一场合，利润增加是这样产生的：假如生产每一单位的货物所增加的原料价格是十便士的话，资本家却很容易在卖价上增加一先令。如管制把利润规定为成本的百分之几，成本的增涨也自动的增加了利润额。但是资本家希望利润增加得最大的，还是在出口市场上。
    我们说到这里，还是假设资本家会把输出价格保持在旧水平上。实际上并不如此。举一个例子吧：据《金融时报》一九四九年九月二十七日的报导，在贬值前售价为一四二○美元（三五五英镑）的盎格利亚福特汽车，现在卖一一七○美元（按新牌价是四一八镑）。所以，对于某一群资本家来说，英镑贬值就等于每辆汽车多赚六十三镑——增加百分之十八。
    这并不是一个孤立的例子，而是差不多在每一种出口工业中都发生着的事。资本家出口商得有机会在许多市场上提高其价格，于是，以外汇计的最终价格虽较英镑贬值前为低，但并不是低至与英镑贬值的同等程度。
    这样说大致不差：英国出口价格（以美元计）会降低，不是低百分之三十，而仅是百分之十五左右，多余的部分都变成英国资本家出口商的超额利润了。
    再没有比这更能揭露英镑贬值的凶狠的阶级性：对于资本家是超额利润，对于工人是工资冻结与物价上涨。当克利浦斯将英镑贬值的时候，并不是爱国主义，也不是要以推动向美元地区输出以弥补美元“短缺”，而是工党政府答应给资本家以取得超额利润的机会。《泰晤士报》（一九四九年九月二十八日）的金融编辑把这点说得很清楚，他写道，“向英镑及软币区域的输出有高利可图”而在埋怨克利浦斯所宣布的额外利润税之后，就作了结论：“有充分证据证明，要使许多公司从有利的英镑市场转向美元地区，尚需要有一刺激”。当然，所需要的刺激就是更高的利润，而这正是他们所得到的。
    比起出口商把价格增加百分之十五到百分之二十而得的利润，仅仅对分配的利润加抽百分之五的税，是微不足道的。这证明英镑贬值对他们是很有利的。
    著名经济学家霍崔，在给《泰晤士报》的一封信中写道：“超额利润将不仅限于向美元地区的输出；在各地与美元国家出口货竞争的输出，以及与由美元国家输入的货物竞争的本国产品，都可以得到超额利润。而且“当物价与工资（？）的上涨波及货币贬值的各国时，向这些国家的输出口也将开始获得超额利润。”
    工党政府为了使工人的注意从实际工资降低与利润增高之事实转移开来，乃声称英镑贬值是避免失业的唯一途径，他们的全部论断，或虔诚的希望，是寄放在英镑贬值会大量增加输出。
    根据一九四九年九月二十四日的“经济学家”的估计，就是在削减人口百分之二十五的情况下，英国现在必须增加其输往美元地区的出口量至少百分之一四四，才能弥补美元的短缺。如果英镑没有贬值的话，只要这个增加量的半数就行了。不仅是英国，而且欧洲许多别的国家，也将企图向美国销售较过去多两倍半到三倍的货物。这些巨大的额外商品，要在美国本国资本家已感到消售日益困难的萎缩的市场上去兜售。
    这就是在克利浦斯与威尔逊之流所给的狂妄诺言之背后的真实景况。英国，或任何其他国家，毫无机会做到使输出增加有这样庞大。英镑贬值使我们向美元地区的出口所换来的进口货量减少，这就使我们更依赖于向美国的输出。英镑贬值使英国工人的饭碗更加依靠于帝国主义的、危机深重的美国的景况。这不是避免失业的途径，而是使得一定有失业。
    一九三一年，当时的工党首相麦克唐纳，连同他的一批劳工运动的叛徒们，在“国民”政府中与保守党充分合作。那时，正像现在一样，“对英镑的威胁”，成为以英镑贬值来削减工人实际工资的借口。两位工党历史学家，在写那一段历史的时候，说道：“当用英镑贬值可以更容易的对成本（即工人购买力）发生同一效果时，减低工资就没有什么大意思了……”（柯尔及波斯格：《普通人民》）
    一九三一的英镑贬值，当时的经济情况与今日不同。首先，那时经济危机已发生，失业很多，而今天危机尚未到达英国，完全的失业还比较少。其次，当时世界价格正在急剧下跌，而现在物价却保持平稳或在上涨。一九三一的英镑贬值，使工人不能从世界粮食价格下跌，得到他们本可得到的好处。一九四九的英镑贬值却将使生活费用上涨，并直接减少实际工资。第三，一九三一的英镑贬值，是受到美国资本家的反对，当时他们害怕廉价的英国出口货将与之竞争。
    一九三一的英镑贬值，完成了什么呢？一切证据证明并没有增加出口，也没有阻止失业增加。在英镑贬值之前两年，英国出口量锐减了百分之三十七，在贬值之后两年，出口量既未上升也未下降。而在以后的四年中（一九三三——一九三七），出口量仅仅爬高到较一九二九年仍低百分之二十一的水平。三十年代的英国出口之增减，差不多完全与世界贸易步骤一致，一点没有显出英镑贬值有什么好处。
    失业的记录就更糟了。英镑贬值后一年（一九三二年）的失业，是历史上的最高记录，比一九三一年还要高百分之五。一九三二的失业严重到平均每五个工人中就有一个失业。在造船业中，每五个工人中就有三个失业；在钢铁业中，差不多每两个工人中有一个失业；煤矿业中每五个工人中有两个失业。这就是英镑贬值一年后英国资本主义的可怕的记录。从一九三一起，一直过了六年，才把失业平均数字减半为每十人中有一个失业。
    在比较一九三一与一九四九的两次英镑贬值时，关键问题是：为什么美国帝国主义那时反对，而现在却赞成呢？答案不能从英货与美货的比较价格（资产阶级经济学家企图表明）中找到。答案只能在英美帝国主义之间的斗争的发展与美帝国主义对民主阵营的战争计划中找到。当美国国内的经济危机发展着的时候，在战时和战后繁荣时所积垒起来的庞大剩余价值就向国外找寻更有利的投资。到现在为止，美国私人投资者（区别于美国联邦政府）的资本输出，为数颇少，但是压力正在增长着。美国资本家正在寻找廉价劳动供其剥削，并寻找不被国有化的保证。货币贬值，减低了许多国家中工人生活水平，减低了劳动力以美元计算的价格，就直接完成了第一个目的。
    另一方面，美国的制造家也在为他的日益增多的剩余商品找寻市场。不列颠帝国，有优惠税率，且货币交易为伦敦城所紧紧控制，这对美国资本家找寻世界市场来说，一直是一种障碍。英镑贬值是一个不很狭小的裂缝。华盛顿正在使用压力，叫英国接受英镑自由兑换，放弃双边贸易，及长期粮食合同，这就是说，放弃一切管制及防御，让美货畅行无阻的泛滥于英国的出口市场。这一对英帝国主义的严重打击，只在英镑贬价将给英国独占资本家以超额利润的谅解下，才被接受的。（译自英国《共产党评论》）
