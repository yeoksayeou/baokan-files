Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 4th: According to a Berlin dispatch from the German News Agency, German Communist Party (West Germany) Chairman Reimann, in his New Year's message, stated that in 1949, the Western occupying powers brought the "Occupation Statute" to the people of West Germany. This statute not only deprived the West German people of the hope of signing a peace treaty, but also deprived them of the hope of regaining sovereignty. The Western occupying powers and their High Commissioners have increasingly interfered in the political and economic life of West Germany. 1949 was also the year of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. The Soviet Union, an occupying power faithful to the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement, has given democratic rights to the German people and opened the door for Germany to a new peaceful development.

Reimann pointed out that the imperialist countries want to use West Germany as a future battlefield and base of operations, and want to use West German citizens to establish a mercenary army. However, as long as the working class and all working people unite within the National Front, the danger of war can be prevented. Reimann issued a call to the Communist Party, saying that the Communist Party must strengthen itself ideologically and organizationally in 1950 to meet the great tasks ahead.

    西德共产党主席雷曼新年文告
    号召党员在思想上、组织上加强自己阻止战争危险
    【新华社北京四日电】据电通社柏林二日讯：德国共产党（西德）主席雷曼发表新年文告称：一九四九年，西方占领国家给西德人民带来了“占领法规”，这个法规不仅夺去了西德人民签订和约的希望，也夺去了重获主权的希望。西方占领国家和它们的高级专员，已愈来愈多地干涉了西德的政治和经济生活。一九四九年也是德意志民主共和国成立的一年，忠于波茨坦协定精神的占领国苏联，已将民主权利给予德国人民，并打开了德国走向新的和平发展的大门。
    雷曼指出：帝国主义国家要把西德作为未来的战场和作战基地，要用西德公民建立一支雇佣军。但是，只要工人阶级和全体劳动人民团结在全国阵线之内，战争的危险是可以阻止的。雷曼向共产党发出号召说：共产党必须在一九五○年内在思想上和组织上加强自己，以迎接前面的伟大任务。
