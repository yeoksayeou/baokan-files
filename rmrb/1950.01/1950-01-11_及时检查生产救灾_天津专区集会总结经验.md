    Timely Inspection of Production for Disaster Relief
    Tianjin Special District Convenes Meeting to Summarize Experiences
    Wen'an, Shengfang and other counties organize the masses to overcome difficulties and carry out various production activities in a planned way, ensuring the livelihoods of the vast majority of disaster victims.
    [This Newspaper] Since October of last year, Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province has been fully leading the masses to engage in winter handicrafts and sideline production, launching a production self-salvation movement, and has achieved considerable results and experience. In terms of achievements, according to the current statistics of several major sideline productions: (1) Saltpeter Production: In 889 villages and towns in Wen'an, Dacheng, Jinghai and other nine counties, more than 60,000 people produced 3.23 million catties of saltpeter. After the snow, government workers led the masses to create a method of sweeping snow and boiling saltpeter, and are now resuming production. (2) Mat Weaving: In 459 villages and towns in Wen'an, Ninghe, Shengfang and other eight counties and towns, more than 33,400 people produced more than 1.196 million mats, which were sold to the vast areas of the Northeast. 650,000 mu of new reeds have been harvested, and efforts are being made to mobilize the masses to weave mats. (3) Textile Industry: After opening up sales in mid-November, it is being vigorously restored. According to statistics from Baodi, Wuqing, Wen'an and other four counties and towns, 15,600 people in 521 villages produced more than 350,000 bolts of cloth. (4) Fishery: Thanks to the strong support of the bank, frozen net teams in various places have begun to manage fish. In 852 villages and towns in Wen'an, Ninghe, Tianjin and other nine counties, more than 28,700 people produced more than 15.6 million catties of fish. Other industries such as flour mills, cattail weaving, straw weaving, willow weaving, wool spinning, and straw bag industry have also developed to varying degrees in certain areas. With the development and promotion of the above-mentioned various productions, the development of the transportation industry has also been greatly expanded. According to statistics from eight districts in Tianjin County alone, 789 carts each earned a net profit of 50 catties of millet per day, and more than 1,100 bicycles each earned 8 catties of millet per day. This not only strengthened the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, but also promoted the development of the production movement. More than 2.85 million catties of relief grain were distributed before and after the freezing period, and in some places it was exchanged for bran and distributed to disaster victims. Therefore, no major problems occurred when the severe winter arrived.
    Although the production and disaster relief work in the special zone has achieved the above-mentioned results, there are still many shortcomings and problems. In order to further mobilize the masses and promote the production and self-salvation work, the Special Commissioner's Office and the local Party committee of the special zone held a joint meeting of county heads, county secretaries, cooperative directors, and women's association directors on December 26 last year. After three days of inspection and discussion, the current problems were resolved and experiences were exchanged.
            Relying on Mass Organizations to Conduct In-depth Inspection to Correctly Realize the Policy of Production for Self-Salvation
    (1) Relying on and mobilizing the masses to develop production for self-salvation is the only correct policy. Areas that seriously abide by, adhere to, and implement this policy, and strictly organize forces to continuously conduct in-depth and practical inspections, have achieved better results. For example, after the floods in Wen'an and Shengfang, they always adhered to the policy of organizing and mobilizing the masses to overcome difficulties. Therefore, they took the initiative and actively carried out a variety of productions in a planned way, ensuring the livelihoods of the vast majority of disaster victims. The opposite is true for those with poor results, and even suffered losses. Wuqing, Anci and other counties focused their efforts on taxation, neglecting and relaxing the leadership of production for self-salvation, so that production was in a semi-stagnant state. Facing the disaster area is an extremely arduous and complex task. In addition to the large amount of work and the easy confusion of leadership steps, there are many obstacles in the thinking of cadres that must be resolved, such as right-leaning thoughts of being afraid of difficult life and fearing difficult work, or thinking that the masses are backward and production for self-salvation is impossible. Some economic departments (banks, supply and marketing cooperatives, stores) have a purely profit-oriented view, fearing that investment and loans to disaster areas will not be recovered or that the purchase of products from disaster areas will lose money. Therefore, the leadership of production in disaster areas is extremely insufficient in some places. For example, the main cadres of Wuqing and Baodi counties have not been to the severely affected areas to lead production for two and a half months; Anci and Ninghe assigned new cadres to the disaster areas to lead production; and the capital of economic departments going to the disaster or semi-disaster areas is also very insufficient. Tianjin County used most of the loans for non-disaster areas. Jinghai's seven cooperative branches are located along the railway line, while there are none in the disaster areas. At the meeting, in-depth inspections, reviews and criticisms were made of these mistakes. It was unanimously agreed that this issue is serious and needs to be inspected and corrected quickly at all levels.
            Several Links in Mobilizing the Masses
    According to the experience of various places, the following links must be grasped in mobilizing the masses: (1) Be good at cultivating backbones and establishing typical examples, using successful experiences to educate and overcome the backwardness of the masses, which is easily accepted by the masses and becomes a practical force. For example, in Jinghai's saltpeter industry, the masses believed that sea alkali land did not produce saltpeter. They mobilized party members and cadres to create successful experiences to educate the masses, and a mass movement was formed within ten days. (2) Educate the masses with the masses. Various places continuously hold small representative symposiums with industries as units in the course of production, which not only exchanges experience, but also studies ways to overcome difficulties, which not only improves the masses, but also helps educate the leaders. (3) Production is social in nature, so the principle of developing production, voluntary and mutually beneficial must be followed to mobilize mass cooperation and mutual assistance. When the masses rise up to produce for self-salvation, they all have difficulties and concerns. Middle peasants are afraid of suffering losses, poor peasants are afraid of lack of capital, production is afraid of losing money, and martyrs' families lack labor. Therefore, organizing mutual assistance and cooperation is a very difficult task. Areas that adhere to mutual benefit and voluntary combination have achieved results. However, in some areas, such as the Ninth District of Ba County, emphasizing the political unity of middle and poor peasants and emphasizing that middle peasants provide funds to lead disaster victims and martyrs' families to produce, mutual assistance and cooperation collapsed.
            The Key to Leading Production for Self-Salvation is to Comprehensively Grasp and Analyze Specific Situations
    (2) Comprehensively grasping the situation, specific analysis, detailed planning, and having "numbers" in mind are the key to solving problems and realizing leadership. Production for disaster relief must grasp two big "numbers" (production number and living number) and six small "numbers" (that is, in terms of production, the number of various productions of non-disaster victims, semi-disaster victims, and disaster victims, and in terms of living, those who have no worries about life and can save themselves, those who must be strongly supported to produce for self-salvation, and those who must be relieved to live), in order to provide appropriate support and appropriate relief separately. Some counties put most of their efforts on several major productions, relaxing the support and leadership of various productions. Some used the total number of productions to abstractly divide the number of disaster victims, thinking that the problem of disaster victims was solved, but in fact many disaster victims begged along the streets or fled to other places. It is also necessary to understand the development, changes and prospects of production (such as the good saltpeter production before the snow, but greatly reduced after the snow) in order to exert the foresight of leadership. The blindness in grasping the "number" of disaster victims' lives is mainly due to the fact that many places only understand how many people eat chaff and bran from the phenomenon (which can only be used as material for understanding the living standards of disaster victims), but in fact, for the long-term, some people eat mixed chaff and bran, and some still have savings, some can maintain their lives from production, and some are really destitute and sell their furniture. Only starting from the point of view of relief and counting people's lives from the phenomenon is passive and cannot find a way to solve the problem. For example, the result of such statistics in some areas of Ninghe is that they are frightened by the difficulties. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate and study the livelihood problems of disaster victims from the point of view of production in order to solve practical problems. For example, according to the understanding of Dama Village in Baodi, 34 households complained and asked for relief. After analysis and research, through calculating savings and calculating production methods, 30 households were organized for production. The remaining four households really lacked funds and could not produce. Under the mutual assistance funds and tools of the branch party members, production was also organized. In addition, some counties have no "numbers," such as Anci and Yongqing. The leadership of production is blind and unplanned, lacking both requirements and specific directions, so their production stays on slogans and does not achieve much.
            Effectively Solve the Difficulties in Production for Self-Salvation
    (3) The biggest problems in production are the solution of funds, raw materials, and sales problems. It is impossible to completely solve these problems by relying solely on the government and cooperative societies at all levels. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to solve them at the same time. For example, some counties in the dry powder industry tend to collapse due to the unresolved sales problem. Wen'an mobilized the masses to find sales widely, and as a result, sales were opened up in Liangxiang, Quyang, Xinle in this province and Zhoucun, Dongguang and other places in Shandong Province. The powder industry in the county has developed to six or seven hundred households. Another example is the bag weaving industry in the county. The masses directly sell well in Harbin, Heilongjiang and other places in the Northeast. Therefore, many bag weaving households work in shifts day and night, and the machines never stop. They also brought up 3,200 spinning wheels. Twelve machines in Nan Shi Village in the county earned an average of 300 catties of corn per day. It can be seen that the masses have extensive social connections. As long as the leadership is good at mobilizing the masses, they can find ways to promote production. However, the opening of sales must also grasp the size of the sales, otherwise blind promotion will affect the promotion of products. For example, after the village chief of Wen'an Fuhua opened up the sales of the powder industry in Liangxiang, the county mobilized the masses to sell dry powder in Liangxiang, but as a result, too many people went and affected the promotion. In addition, it is also necessary to grasp the number of transporters according to the production situation. Wen'an once blindly developed the transportation industry. Because there were too many transporters, the output products could not keep up, and too many imported necessities were difficult to sell. The county analyzed and studied this situation and appropriately grasped the number of transportation forces, which resolved the contradiction and grasped the average profit of producers and transporters.
            Mobilizing Self-Salvation Should be Closely Combined with Strengthening Leadership and Strong Support
    (4) Mobilizing the masses to produce for self-salvation must be able to overcome disaster with strong leadership and strong support. First of all, we must have strong perseverance and confidence, and at the same time have foresight. For example, Wen'an once mobilized the masses to boil saltpeter on a large scale before the snow, and the scale of saltpeter production broke through the past foundation. When saltpeter production was unfavorable after the snow, it mobilized some of the saltpeter-boiling disaster victims to switch to fish management, bag weaving and other productions. In the fish management production, because the masses were mobilized to prepare for winter fish management, they smoothly switched to winter fish management after freezing, and fish production increased day by day. Experience has proved that villages with successful production are inseparable from the strong leadership of the village branch. Thirteen branches in the Ninth District of Baodi played a core role in leading the masses to produce, and the emotions of cadres and the masses were stable; other branches, because some of them had a serious reliance on ideas and did not lead the masses to produce, party members, cadres and the masses fled everywhere. However, we must not think that all difficulties will be eliminated by strengthening leadership and mobilizing the masses. In many places with severe disasters, after mobilizing the masses, it is still necessary to give necessary and appropriate economic support. Many places often commit left and right deviations in solving this problem. The higher authorities put forward self-reliance to mobilize the masses, and the lower authorities think that all difficulties are gone. For example, Ninghe takes "production for self-salvation" as a shield to shirk responsibility and solve all problems, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses with the government. For example, some said: "Production for self-salvation means that the government does not care." However, some people saw that the higher authorities lent grain and loans, so they pushed all the difficulties to the higher authorities and made boundless demands for support and relief. Both of these phenomena must be overcome. In this spirit, Tianjin Special Zone paid attention to solving the practical difficulties of disaster victims. The Special Commissioner's Office has successively allocated 2.85 million catties of relief grain and the bank office has loaned more than 244 million yuan.
            Nearly One Million Disaster Victims Still Need to be Supported in Production for Self-Salvation
    Even so, after several inspections, there are still about 800,000 disaster victims who need strong support to save themselves from production. Nearly 200,000 disaster victims are starving, eating completely with bran and bran, and still need to be relieved, and find ways to organize their possible production.

    及时检查生产救灾
    天津专区集会总结经验
    文安胜芳等县组织群众克服困难，有计划的开展各种生产，绝大多数灾民生活有了保障。
    【本报讯】河北省天津专区自去年十月全力领导群众进入冬季手工业与副业生产，开展生产自救运动以来，已取得不少成绩与经验。在成绩方面，仅目前几种主要副业生产统计：（一）硝产：文安、大城、静海等九个县镇八百八十九个村庄六万多人，硝产达三百二十三万斤，雪后各地政府工作人员领导群众创造了扫雪熬硝的办法，又开始恢复。（二）席业：文安、宁河、胜芳等八个县镇四百五十九个村庄三万三千四百多人，产席达一百一十九万六千多片，销于东北广大地区。六十五万亩新苇已收割，正大力发动群众编席。（三）纺织业：于十一月中旬打开销路后，正在大力恢复。据宝坻、武清、文安等四县镇统计，五百二十一村一万五千六百多人，产布达三十五万多匹。（四）渔业：由于银行的大力扶持，各地冻网班均已开始治鱼，文安、宁河、天津等九个县镇八百五十二个村庄，二万八千七百多人，产鱼达一千五百六十余万斤。其他如粉坊、蒲编、草编、柳编、纺羊毛、草袋业在一定地区均有发展。在上述各种生产的开展与带动下，也相当扩大了运输业的发展。仅天津县八个区统计，大车七百八十九辆，每日每辆盈纯利五十斤小米，自行车一千一百余辆，每辆每日可盈利八斤米。不但加强了城乡与地区之间的物资交流，而且促进了生产运动的发展。在结冻前后发放赈济粮二百八十五万多斤，有的地方换成麸糠发给灾民。因此在严冬到来时，未发生重大问题。
    该专区的生产救灾工作虽有上述成绩，但尚存在不少缺点与问题。为了深入发动群众，把生产自救工作推进一步，该专区专署和中共地委，特于去年十二月二十六日，召开县长、县书、合作社主任、妇会主任等联席会议，经过三天的检查讨论，解决了当前存在的问题，交流了经验。
            依靠群众组织深入检查正确实现生产自救方针
    （一）依靠与发动群众开展生产自救是唯一的正确的方针。凡是认真遵守坚持贯彻此项方针，并严密组织力量不断深入进行切实检查的地区，成绩就较好。如文安、胜芳水灾造成后，始终坚持了组织发动群众克服困难的方针，因此他们主动积极，有计划的开展了多种多样的生产，绝大多数灾民生活有了保障。与此相反的则成绩较差，甚而受到了损失。武清、安次等县把力量放在了征收，忽视和放松了生产自救的领导，以致生产陷于半停滞状态。面向灾区是异常艰巨而复杂的任务，除了工作繁多领导步调易错乱外，在干部思想上还存在许多障碍必须解决，如怕生活艰苦、畏惧工作困难的右倾思想，或认为群众落后生产自救无法搞。经济部门（银行、供销社、商店）有的存在单纯营利观点，怕向灾区投资贷款收不回来或收购灾区产品怕赔钱。因此对灾区生产领导有些地方极为不足，如武清、宝坻县主要干部，两个半月未到重灾区领导生产；安次、宁河把新干部分配到灾区领导生产；经济部门资本放到灾区或半灾区去的也很不足。天津县将贷款大部用于非灾区。静海七个合作分社设于铁路沿线，而灾区没有。会中对这些错误进行了深入的检查检讨与批判，一致认为这一问题是严重的，需要逐级进行检查迅速纠正。
            发动群众的几个环节
    根据各地经验，发动群众必须抓住下面几个环节：（１）善于培养骨干，树立典型，以成功的经验教育克服群众的落后，容易为群众接受，变成实际力量。如静海的硝业，群众认为海碱地不出硝，发动了党员干部创造了成功的经验教育群众，十天内就形成了群众性的运动。（２）以群众教育群众，各地开展生产中不断的召开以行业为单位的小型代表座谈会，不仅交流了经验，而且研究了克服困难的办法，不仅提高了群众，同时还帮助教育了领导。（３）生产是社会性质的，因此必须遵循发展生产、自愿两利的原则去发动群众的合作互助。群众起来生产自救，各有困难与顾虑，中农怕吃亏，贫农怕缺本，生产怕赔钱，烈军工属则缺少劳力。因此组织互助合作是很艰苦的工作，凡坚持了互利与自愿结合的地区，则取得了成绩。但有的地区如霸县九区，强调中贫农的政治团结，强调中农出资金带领灾民、烈、军属生产，合作互助就垮了台。
            领导生产自救关键周密掌握分析具体情况
    （二）周密掌握情况，具体分析，详细计划，做到心中有“数”，是解决问题实现领导的关键。生产救灾必须掌握两个大“数”（生产数与生活数）及六个小“数”（即生产上分非灾民、半灾民、灾民各种生产的数目，生活上分生活无虞能自救者、必须大力扶持才能生产自救者、必须救济才能生活者），才能有分别的适当扶持与适当救济。有的县，把大部力量用于几种主要生产上，放松了多种多样生产的扶持与领导。有的拿生产总数去抽象的除灾民数，认为解决了灾民问题，但实际上许多灾民沿街讨饭或逃散他乡。还必须了解生产的发展变化前途（如雪前硝产很好，雪后则大减），才能发挥领导的预见。在掌握灾民的生活“数”上的盲目性，主要是由于不少的地方只从现象上去了解多少人吃糠麸（只能作为了解灾民生活水平的材料），但其实群众为了长期打算，有些搀糠麸吃，多少还有积余，有的可以从生产中维持生活，有的则真是生活无着变卖家具。只从救济的观点出发和从现象去统计人民生活，是消极的，不能找出问题解决的办法。如宁河有的区这样统计的结果，是被困难所吓倒。因此必须从生产的观点出发去调查研究灾民生活问题，才能解决实际问题。如宝坻大马庄据了解三十四户叫苦求赈，经过分析研究，通过算节约、算生产的方法，结果三十户组织起生产，剩下的四户确实资金缺乏不能生产，在支部党员互助资金工具之下，也组织了生产。此外有的县是没“数”，如安次、永清，生产领导是盲目无计划的，既缺乏要求，又缺乏具体方向，所以他们的生产就停留在口号上，没做出多大成绩。
            切实解决生产自救中的困难
    （三）生产中最大的问题是资金、原料、销路问题的解决，这些问题只依赖政府与各级合作社是不可能得到彻底解决的，必须同时发动群众去解决。如干粉业有些县则因销路未解决而趋于垮台，文安发动了群众去广找销路，结果从本省良乡、曲阳、新乐及山东省周村、东光等地打开了销路，该县粉业已发展到六七百户。又如该县织口袋业，群众直接畅销于东北哈尔滨、黑龙江等地，因此许多织口袋户，昼夜轮班，人歇机不停，还带起了三千二百辆纺车，该县南史村十二张机子每日平均盈利玉米三百斤。由此可见群众有社会广泛的联系性，只要领导上善于发动群众，就可以取得办法推动生产。但销路的开辟还必须掌握销路的大小，否则盲目的推销，会影响了产品的推销。如文安富花村长从良乡打开粉业销路后，该县发动群众都去良乡推销干粉，结果去的过多而影响了推销。此外还必须根据生产情况掌握运输者的数量，文安曾盲目的发展运输业，因运输者过多，输出的产品供不上，输入的必需品过多而推销困难，该县分析研究了此种情况，适当掌握了运输力的数量，才解决了矛盾，掌握了生产者与运输者的平均利润。
            发动自救应与加强领导大力扶持密切结合
    （四）发动群众生产自救必须以强力领导与大力扶持才能渡过灾荒。首先要有坚强的毅力与信心，同时要有预见性。如文安在雪前曾大量的发动群众熬硝，硝产规模突破了过去的基础，而雪后硝产不利时，因事先有此准备，发动了一部分熬硝的灾民转入治鱼，织口袋等生产。在治鱼生产上，因发动群众进行了冬季治鱼的准备工作，因而结冰后顺利转入了冬季治鱼，鱼产日益增多。经验证明：凡是生产有成绩的村庄，都是与村干支部的坚强领导分不开的，宝坻九区十三个支部在领导群众生产上起了核心作用，干部群众情绪稳定；其他支部有的因为依赖思想严重，未领导群众生产，党员干部群众四处逃荒。但也不能认为加强了领导与发动了群众，一切困难就没有了，许多灾情严重的地方，在发动群众之后，还必须从经济上给以必要的适当的扶持。许多地方在这一问题的解决上，往往犯了左与右的偏向，上级提出自力更生发动群众，下级则认为一切困难没有了，如宁河拿“生产自救”当作推托责任、解决一切问题的盾牌，引起群众对政府不满，如有的说：“生产自救，就是政府不管。”但也有的看到上级贷粮贷款时，于是就一切困难向上级推，无边的要求扶持救济。这两种现象都必须克服。在此精神下，天津专区即注意了解决灾民的实际困难。专署曾前后拨发赈济粮二百八十五万斤，银行办事处贷款两亿四百四十余万元。
            还有近百万灾民急需扶持生产自救
    虽然如此，但经过多次检查，尚有八十万左右的灾民需大力扶持从生产中自救。近二十万灾民陷于饥饿，完全以麸糠充饥，还急待赈济，并设法组织其可能的生产。
