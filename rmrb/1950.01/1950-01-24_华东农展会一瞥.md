A Glimpse of the East China Agricultural Exhibition
Zi Qin

Stepping into the East China Agricultural Exhibition, we are immediately presented with two contrasting images of the countryside—the rural China of the old days and the rural China of the new. Hundreds of cartoons and charts, thousands of exhibits and machines, create a grand and moving scene. Viewing this agricultural exhibition not only deepens our understanding of the suffering endured by Chinese farmers for thousands of years but also reveals the happy lives of farmers in the old liberated areas after the land reform under the leadership of the Communist Party, and the scenes of how they organize to fight against disasters... giving people infinite bright and beautiful hope for the future rural China.

In the exhibition hall, crowds of visitors form long lines, flowing in and out from morning till night.

The most eye-catching section is the one showcasing agricultural machinery and improved farm implements. During the ten-plus days of the exhibition, this area has gathered tens of thousands of people every day. The demonstrations of various tractors, harvesters, threshers, and water pumps elicit joyful and enthusiastic emotions from every visitor. Windmills are spinning in the exhibition hall, the motors of water pumps are humming, and tractors are plowing up black soil on the square, sending it flying. People are seeing that Chinese agriculture, which has relied on human and animal power for thousands of years, will soon be replaced by machines, and their hearts are filled with unspeakable joy.

People gather around these machines, watching intently. The broadcast explains the efficiency of these machines: when the combine harvester is activated, its hourly efficiency is equivalent to the work of forty farmers in a day; the grain thresher, using twenty-five horsepower, can thresh 150 dan of grain per day; the universal gas generator using rice husks as fuel, manufactured by Shanghai Wanyang Iron Factory, and the gas engine water pump, can pump 1,300 gallons of water per minute to a height of thirty feet, irrigating sixty to seventy mu of land per day.

Dozens of improved farm implements are also displayed in the exhibition hall, such as the V-shaped cultivator, the Liberation-style weeding hoe, the five-tooth cultivator, etc., among the cultivating implements. A chart compares these cultivators, showing that using a hoe covers one mu per day, hoeing four rows of cotton covers 1.4 mu per day, a push cultivator covers three mu per day, an animal-powered cultivator covers fifteen mu per day, and a tractor with a four-row cultivator covers 150 mu per day. Another chart also shows a comparison of the efficiency of manual labor and machines: a person harrowing covers one mu per day, while a forty-horsepower tractor using twenty-three gallons of diesel can cultivate 120 mu of land per day. This fully illustrates that Chinese agricultural production must follow the path of science to have a brighter and more promising future.

Of course, China's use of tractors will require several years of effort, but the adoption of improved farm implements can be achieved quickly. The problems here are: first, how to make these farm implements affordable so that farmers can easily purchase them; second, how to break the conservative thinking of farmers and encourage them to adopt them; third, to ensure that the farm implements are both scientifically sound and durable; fourth, to organize promotion teams with plans and priorities to go deep into the countryside and gradually expand the scope of promotion. For example, the rice husk engine water pump has the advantages of saving fuel, which is easy to find in rural areas, and can also be used as power for oil extraction, textile, and flour milling machines, but each machine costs more than 10,000 "discount units", which ordinary farmers cannot afford. The agricultural exhibition must find practical and effective methods for promotion to achieve success.

    华东农展会一瞥
    子芹
    走进华东农展会会场，在我们面前就出现了两种农村——旧中国农村和新中国农村的不同画景。几百幅漫画和表格，数千种展览品和机器，组成了一个伟大动人的场面。看了这个农展会，不特使我们更加深刻的认识了中国农民数千年来所受的苦难，同时也看到老解放区农民在共产党领导土地改革后的幸福生活，和他们如何组织起来与灾害斗争的画面……使人们对未来新中国的农村，有了无限光明与美丽的希望。
    在农展会的会场上，参观的群众排成长长的行列，从早到晚络绎不绝。
    最引人注目的是农业机器和农具改良的部分。十余天展览中，这里每天都汇集着盈千累万的人群。各种拖拉机，收割机、脱粒机、打水机的表演，使每个参观的人都表现出欢欣鼓舞的情绪。会场上风车在旋转，打水机的马达在隆隆的轰鸣，拖拉机在广场上翻起黑色的土花在飞跑。人们看到几千年来都用人和畜力耕作的中国农业，在不久的将来就要用机器来代替了，心里的喜悦是说不尽的。
    人们围绕在这些机器的旁边，凝神注视，播音机在解释着这些机器的效能：联合收割机开动了，这个机器每小时的效力，可抵过四十个农民一天的工作；谷类脱粒机用二十五匹马力每天可打谷一百五十担；上海万用铁工厂制造的以砻糠作燃料的万用煤气发生炉，和瓦斯引擎的打水机，每分钟以三十英尺高度，可打水一千三百加仑，每天可灌溉田六七十亩。
    在展览棚里还陈列着几十种改良农具，如中耕农具中有人字形中耕器，解放式耘锄、五齿中耕器……。这些中耕器的比较，有一张图表表示出：用锄一天一亩，种四行棉花用锄一天一·四亩，手推中耕器每天三亩，畜力中耕器每天十五亩，拖拉机带四行中耕器每天一百五十亩。在另一张表上，也显示出人工与机器效率的比较：人钯每天一亩，而四十匹马力拖拉机加二十三加仑柴油，每天可耕地一百二十亩。这就充分说明了中国农业生产必须循着科学的道路前进，才能有更加光辉与远大的未来。
    自然，要中国使用拖拉机还须待我们若干年的努力，但采用改良农具，却是很快可以作到的，这里的问题是：第一、如何使这些农具售价低廉，使农民易于购买；第二、如何打破农民的保守思想，乐于采用；第三、使农具既科学而又坚固耐用；第四有计划、有重点的组织推广组，深入农村，逐渐扩大推广范围。如砻糠引擎打水机，其优点是燃料节省，且农村易找，还可作榨油、纺织、磨面等机器的动力，但每部机器售价达一万多折实单位，一般农民是买不起的。农展会要在推广上找出切实有效的办法，才能获得成功。
