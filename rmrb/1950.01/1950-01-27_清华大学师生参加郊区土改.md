    Tsinghua University Faculty and Students Participate in Suburban Land Reform
    [Beijing News] Three hundred faculty and students from Tsinghua University went to the countryside on the 26th to participate in land reform work in the suburbs of Beijing. Among them were six professors and eleven lecturers and assistants. They formed three district teams to participate in land reform in the 13th, 17th, and 19th districts. In order to help students understand the situation and policies of land reform in the suburbs of Beijing, the university authorities invited Chai Zemin, Secretary of the Beijing Suburban Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhou Fengming, Director of the Suburban Work Committee of the Municipal Government, and Yang Bozhen, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, to give lectures at the university on the 23rd and 24th. The students were in high spirits, all hoping to learn from the peasants and temper and transform themselves in participating in this great revolutionary movement. In addition, more than 40 cadres from the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Central People's Government and 110 students from the Central Academy of Drama also went to the countryside on the 25th and 26th to participate in land reform work in the 13th and 16th districts.
    [Another Dispatch] More than 200 faculty and students from the former National Academy of Fine Arts and Peking University have shown great enthusiasm in participating in land reform work in the suburbs of Beijing, and both teachers and students have been able to sincerely integrate with the peasants. Chai Zemin, Secretary of the Suburban Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, sent a letter of condolence to them, saying: Your ability to personally participate in land reform, learn from the peasants, and consciously serve the people is a concrete manifestation of the combination of intellectuals and working people in the new China. We would like to extend our highest regards and respect to you!
