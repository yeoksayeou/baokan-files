We spent the year of 1949, a year of great victory, with immense joy. In this year, the People's Liberation Army, starting with the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin and the complete annihilation of the main force of the Chiang bandits in the Huaihai Campaign, crossed the Yangtze River, sent troops to the Northwest, and swept away all the armed forces of the Chiang bandits on the mainland, almost completely liberating the entire Chinese mainland. Accompanying the military victories, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was victoriously convened, the People's Common Program—our people's great charter—was adopted, our own people's country—the People's Republic of China—was established, our great people's leader, the savior of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao Zedong, was elected, the aggressive forces of imperialism were expelled, the oppressive rule of feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism was destroyed, and the people's democratic dictatorship was established. At this time, the people of the whole country celebrated their liberation and stood up strong! At the end of this year, Chairman Mao visited our great ally—the Soviet Union, and met the revolutionary teacher of all oppressed nations and working people in the world, the leader of all mankind, Marshal Stalin. This was another major event of historical significance for the whole world. What a great year 1949 was!

1949 marked a new era for my long-oppressed Hui people, in which they were recognized as a nationality within the whole country for the first time. The running dogs of imperialism, the representatives of feudal forces, the accomplices of the Chiang bandits, the so-called "General Bai" and "Two Mas of the Northwest," have all tucked their tails and scurried out of the Chinese mainland. Their lackeys and slaves in various places have either fled or disappeared. What has appeared on the political stage are the representatives of our own Hui people and the people themselves. We are no longer a people who are oppressed, discriminated against, or instigated and deceived into discriminating against and oppressing other nationalities. We are in a completely new environment of equality, unity, and mutual assistance.

Let us recall our history: the so-called "edict" of "Kangxi" deceiving and appeasing and oppressing the Hui people is still hanging in the main hall of the Niujie Mosque in Beijing. The Chiang bandit gang demolished a mosque outside Chaoyangmen in Beijing, and the mosque burned down by them in Tianqi Temple in Tianjin has not yet been repaired. In the past twenty years, how many tens of thousands of Hui people have been killed! When in history have the Hui people ever had the liberation they have today!?

Therefore, 1949 was an extremely glorious and splendid year! We must cherish it greatly. We must recognize that this is the starting point for everything in the future, the cornerstone of everything in the future, and having it guarantees all future happiness!

In order to consolidate this victory and protect our fruits, we must carry the revolution through to the end, support the front lines, and liberate all of our territory. In order to create wealth and improve our lives, we must restore and develop production. In order to enrich our lives and enhance our creativity, we must strengthen cultural construction. And in order to achieve these goals, we should contribute all possible manpower, material resources, and financial resources.

As far as the current situation of our Hui people is concerned, it is difficult to complete this task. General living conditions are difficult, and business is not good, but we must recognize that our poverty is because we do not engage in production or engage in industries that the people do not need. The current living difficulties, etc., are all caused by the old society. Today, the People's Government levies taxes on the people in order to develop industry and commerce that are beneficial to the people and eliminate backward feudal industries (such as brokerage firms), which is precisely to fundamentally solve our difficulties. Therefore, we should be determined to invest funds in productive enterprises, use labor in production, and loyally accept the leadership of the government. In this way, all difficulties will be temporary and can be overcome. Chairman Mao has clearly instructed us: "We do have difficulties ahead, and there are many of them, but we are sure that all difficulties will be overcome by the heroic struggle of the people of the whole country." Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi also told us: "In about a year or so, you may not have as many difficulties as you have today, and your lives may be better." This clearly indicates that our difficulties are difficulties in victory, which can be completely overcome. Let us unite, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the People's Government, and joyfully welcome new victories. Let us fight to complete the new tasks of 1950! Let us shout:

Long live Chairman Mao!
Long live the unity of all ethnic groups!

    迎接新胜利
    北京市人民政府民政局副局长  马玉槐
    伟大胜利的一九四九年，我们是极其愉快的渡过了。在这一年中，人民解放军以解放京津，全歼淮海蒋匪主力为起点，而强渡长江，出兵西北，横扫蒋匪在大陆上的一切武装力量，已几乎完全解放了整个中国大陆。伴随着军事胜利，人民政治协商会议胜利的召开了，通过了人民大宪章——共同纲领，成立了人民自己的国家——中华人民共和国，选出了伟大的人民领袖、各族人民共同的救星毛泽东主席，驱逐了帝国主义的侵略势力，摧毁了封建和官僚资本主义的压迫统治，建立了人民民主专政，这时，全国人民均欢庆翻身解放，坚强的站立起来了！在这年将终时，毛主席又访问我们伟大友邦——苏联，会见了全世界被压迫民族和劳动人民的革命导师、全人类的领袖斯大林大元帅，这又是个全世界有历史意义的大事，一九四九年是何等伟大的一年啊！
    一九四九年是我长期被压迫的回回民族，在整个国家中第一次被承认是个民族的新纪元。帝国主义的走狗、封建势力的代表、蒋匪的帮凶，所谓“白大将军”和“西北二马”，都已夹起尾巴滚出了中国大陆。他们在各地的爪牙奴才们，也已逃之夭夭或是消声匿迹了，而出现在政治舞台的已是我回族人民自己的代表和人民自己。我们已不是被压迫、被歧视或被教唆被欺骗去歧视压迫其他民族的人民，我们是处在平等、团结、互助，完全新的环境了。
    再回忆一下我们的历史：“康熙”欺骗怀柔压迫回民的所谓“圣旨”，还悬在京市牛街清真寺的大殿上，蒋匪帮在京市朝阳门外拆毁清真寺，在津市天齐庙烧毁的清真寺还未修整，二十年来杀害回民何止万千！历史上何曾有过今天回民所得到的解放！？
    所以一九四九年，是个极其光辉灿烂的一年！我们要万分的珍贵它，我们要认清这是今后一切的起点，是未来一切的基石，有了它就有了今后一切幸福的保证！
    为了巩固这个胜利，保护我们的果实，就必须将革命进行到底，支援前线，解放全部国土。为了创造财富，改善生活，我们就必须恢复发展生产，为了丰富我们的生活，提高创造力，就必须加强文化建设，而为了达到这些，我们就应该贡献一切可能的人力、物力、财力。
    就目前我们回民的情况来说，完成这个任务是有困难的，一般的生活困难，生意不好，但我们必须认清，我们的贫穷是因为我们不事生产或从事人民所不需要的行业。现在的生活困难等，都是旧社会给我们造成的。今天人民政府向人民征税，是为了发展有利于人民的工商业，淘汰落后的封建的行业（如经纪牙行等），也正是从根本上解决我们困苦的。因此我们应当下定决心，将资金投到生产事业上去，将劳动用到生产上，忠诚的接受政府的领导。这样一切困难都将是暂时的，可以克服的。毛主席已经明白指示给我们：“我们面前的困难是有的，而且是很多的，但是我们确信：一切困难都将被全国人民的英勇奋斗所战胜。”刘少奇副主席也告诉了我们：“再有一年左右的时间，你们就可能没有象今天这样多的困难，你们的生活就可能比较地要好一些。”这就清楚的指明了，我们的困难是胜利中的困难，是完全可以克服的，我们团结起来，在毛主席和人民政府的领导下，愉快的迎接新的胜利。为完成一九五○年的新任务而斗争吧！让我们高呼：
    毛主席万岁！
    各族人民团结万岁！
