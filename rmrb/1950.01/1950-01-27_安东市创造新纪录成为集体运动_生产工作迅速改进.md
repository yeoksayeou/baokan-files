Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 26th:

    The movement to create new production records in state-owned factories in Andong City, Liaodong Province, is now gradually developing into a broad collective movement. As a result, the movement's contribution to production work is manifested on a larger scale, promoting improvements throughout all production efforts. Before the launch of the new record movement, the Andong Paper Mill was unable to complete its monthly production tasks. After the steaming process broke the original quota of 18 hours and 30 minutes per pot, achieving 12 hours and 5 minutes, and the 100-inch paper machine broke the original quota of 8,000 kilograms, achieving a daily output of 9,006 kilograms, the movement quickly spread to all branches. In November, the entire factory exceeded the total production plan by 3.05 percent, and in December alone, it completed more than one-fifth of the annual task. As a result, the annual production task was exceeded by 14 percent, and costs were reduced by 14.4 billion yuan. After the Andong Machinery Factory launched the new record movement, a plan to manufacture 37 slotting machine bodies in three months was completed in just one and a half months. The provincial-owned Guanghua Cotton Textile Factory exceeded its target by 2.6 percent in October, 4 percent more than October in November, and 5 percent more than November in December, completing the monthly production task six days ahead of schedule. After the Andong Rubber Factory launched the new record movement in November and December, the quality quickly improved, washing away the past reputation of "Sunday shoes" due to the poor quality of its rubber shoes. Now, the factory's products are very popular with customers at the Andong Department Store. The Andong Electric Power Bureau created a new record of zero responsibility accidents in November and December.

    Timely commendation and rewards, the establishment of workshop contact contracts and collective contracts, the organization of technical learning, and the recruitment of advanced elements into the Party have enabled the smooth development of the movement.

    The reasons for the success of the new record movement in Andong City are primarily due to the encouragement and consolidation of workers' enthusiasm for actively participating in the movement. On the one hand, the creations and production improvements of workers were promptly commended and rewarded, ensuring "more pay for more work" in material terms. On the other hand, politically, various forms of publicity and mobilization, such as the use of radio, blackboards, express bulletins, production daily reports, the insertion of red flags, and responsible comrades personally going to workshops to congratulate them, were used to promote advanced experience and publicize heroic deeds, so that the enthusiasm for creating new records and improving production could be developed among workers and transformed into a mass movement. Secondly, with the development of the new record movement, workshop contact contracts were universally established and collective contracts were tentatively established in a step-by-step manner. After the launch of the new record movement, the various factories experienced a phenomenon of disconnection between individuals and between workshops, so advanced workers and workshops universally felt the importance of mutual cooperation. The factory leadership departments, based on this situation, first began to establish workshop contact contracts, and on this basis, the trade union and the administration established collective contracts, enabling workers to grasp the goals of their efforts, thereby making the new record movement more planned, organized, and collective, and closely integrating administrative work with the work of the Party and the trade union. Furthermore, in order to achieve the goal of universally creating new records and improving production efficiency, organizing workers to learn technology during the movement was a very important task. Technical workers, skilled workers, ordinary workers, and apprentices in various factories in Andong universally established master-apprentice contracts during the movement, and organized technical night schools, technical lectures, research associations, and so on. In addition, the Communist Party branches in the factories, in carrying out the new record movement, systematically recruited politically conscious technical workers, skilled workers, and production advanced individuals to join the Communist Party, making the Party in the factories the core of guaranteeing production work. For example, Nie Zhongyi, a technical worker in the wood boiler room of the Andong Paper Mill, painstakingly studied and improved production methods after joining the Party, finally raising the record of steaming a pot of materials in sixteen hours (the original quota was eighteen hours) to the highest record of eleven hours and five minutes. Wang Deyou, a lathe operator at the Andong Machinery Factory, created a new record of four hours and three minutes for machining an eight-foot slotting machine body from the estimated twenty-eight hours; after joining the Party, he created the highest record of two hours and twenty minutes. Now, the new record movement in Andong City is moving towards the goal of continuing to overcome the phenomenon of imbalance.

    安东市创造新纪录成为集体运动
    生产工作迅速改进
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】辽东省安东市公营工厂创造生产新纪录的运动，现已逐渐发展成为广泛的集体的运动。因此，运动对于生产工作的贡献，便在更大的范围中表现出来，并促进了整个生产工作的改进。安东造纸厂在未开展新纪录运动以前，每月都不能完成生产任务。自蒸煮料子的工作突破每锅原来定额十八小时三十分而达到十二小时零五分和一百英寸抄纸机突破原定额八千公斤而达到日产九千零六公斤的新纪录以后，运动即迅速在各分厂展开。十一月份全厂超过总生产计划百分之三点零五，十二月份一个月即完成全年任务的五分之一强，结果全年生产任务超过百分之十四，并降低成本一百四十四亿元。安东机械厂开展新纪录运动后，三个月制造三十七台插床床体的计划，一个半月即告完成。省营光华棉织厂十月份超过任务百分之二点六，十一月份超过十月份百分之四，十二月份又超过十一月份百分之五，并提前六天完成全月生产任务。安东橡胶厂，十一、十二两月中开展新纪录运动后，质量很快提高，已将过去因胶鞋质量低劣而被人称为“礼拜鞋”的称号洗刷，现该厂出品在安东百货公司很受顾客欢迎。安东电业局则创造了十一、十二两个月未发生责任事故的新纪录。
    及时表扬奖励，订立车间联系合同及集体合同，组织学习技术，吸收先进分子入党，使运动能顺利开展。
    安东市创造新纪录运动获得成绩的原因，首先是由于启发与巩固了工人积极参加运动的热情。一方面对工人的创造和生产上的进步，及时进行表扬奖励，在物质上保证其“多劳多得”；另一方面在政治上则通过各种各样的宣传鼓动方式，如利用广播、黑板报、快报、生产日报、插红旗及各负责同志亲到车间贺喜等等，推广其先进经验，宣传其英雄事迹，使创造新纪录改进生产的热情在工人中发扬开来，变为群众性的运动。其次是随着新纪录运动的展开，普遍订立车间联系合同及有步骤地试订集体合同。各工厂当创造新纪录运动开展以后，曾发生个人与个人、车间与车间互不衔接的现象，因而先进工人及车间普遍感觉互相配合的重要性。工厂领导部门即根据这一情况，首先着手订立车间联系合同，在此基础上，再由工会与行政订立集体合同，使工人们掌握自己努力的目标，从而使创造新纪录运动走向更有计划性、组织性、集体性，并使行政工作与党的、工会的工作，密切结合起来。再次，为了达到普遍创造新纪录、提高生产效率的目的，在运动中组织工人学习技术是一个很重要的工作。安东各工厂的技术工、熟练工、普通工、学徒工之间，在运动中曾普遍订立师徒合同，并组织了技术夜校、技术讲座、研究会等等。此外，工厂中共产党的支部在开展新纪录运动中，有计划地吸收有政治觉悟的技术工、熟练工以及生产先进者参加共产党，使工厂中的党，成为保证生产工作的核心。如安东造纸一厂木釜室技术工聂忠义，入党后苦心研究改进生产方法，终于把十六小时蒸煮一锅料子的纪录（原定额为十八小时），提高到十一小时零五分钟的最高纪录。安东机械厂镟盘工王德有，车八英尺插床床体由估工二十八小时创造了四时零三分钟的新纪录；入党后又创造了二时二十分的最高纪录。现在安东市的新纪录运动正在向着继续克服不平衡现象的目标前进。
