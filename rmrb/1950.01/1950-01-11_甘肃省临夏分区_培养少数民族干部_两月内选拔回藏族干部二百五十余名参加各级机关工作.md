Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th: The Linxia sub-region of Gansu Province, a multi-ethnic area, conscientiously implements ethnic policies, actively cultivates ethnic minority cadres, and strengthens the connection between the government and the people of all ethnic groups. In the early days of liberation, the leadership's insufficient understanding of cultivating ethnic minority cadres affected the progress of work. In response to this situation, the leaders of the sub-region immediately instructed all counties to stipulate that in areas where people of various ethnic groups live together, an appropriate number of cadres from each ethnic group should be selected according to the population ratio. The Linxia County People's Representative Conference of All Circles also hired representatives of ethnic minorities to participate. This gradually made the ethnic minority people understand that the people's government is indeed their own government, and the status of all ethnic groups is completely equal. For example, in Hezheng County, where the Hui people are the majority, few Hui people used to go to the county people's government. Since Mu Debin (a Hui person) became the county head, the situation has changed. Another example is Wang Hairu, a Hui cadre of the Ningding County Public Security Bureau, who summoned the bandit leader Ma Liujin (a Hui person) to lead more than 30 people to surrender to the people's government. In total, from September to November of last year, the sub-region has selected and cultivated more than 250 Hui and Tibetan cadres, who have been assigned to various positions in organs at the sub-regional level and below. The sub-regional cadre school has admitted 51 young male and female Hui people and 8 Tibetans.

    甘肃省临夏分区
    培养少数民族干部
    两月内选拔回藏族干部二百五十余名参加各级机关工作
    【新华社西安九日电】甘肃省多民族的临夏分区认真贯彻民族政策，积极培养少数民族干部，加强了政府和各族人民的联系。该分区解放初期，因领导上对培养少数民族的干部认识不够，曾影响工作的开展。针对此种情形，分区首长当即指示各县，规定在各民族人民杂居地区，按人口比例选拔适当数量的各族干部。临夏县各界人民代表会，也聘请了少数民族的代表参加。这样就逐渐使少数民族人民了解到人民政府确是自己的政府，各民族地位完全是平等的。如回民占多数的和政县，从前很少有回民去该县人民政府，自慕得彬（回民）任了县长，情况就改变了。又如宁定县公安局回民干部王海如召抚了匪首马六斤（回民）率众三十多人向人民政府投诚。总计去年九月至十一月，该分区已选拔与培养回、藏族干部共二百五十余名，分任分区一级及以下各级机关中各种职务。分区干部学校已收男女回族青年五十一名，藏族八名。
