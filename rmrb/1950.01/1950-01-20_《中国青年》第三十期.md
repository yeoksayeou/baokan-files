*China Youth*, Issue 30

*China Youth*, Issue 30, has recently been published. From this issue onwards, it will revert to being published semi-monthly, and the content has been greatly improved.

In this issue, the content focuses on new patriotism. Xiao De's "On the New Patriotism of the Chinese People" and Yang Fu's "The New Moral Outlook of the People" are of great help in resolving some ideological issues related to patriotism and narrow nationalism that everyone has in studying the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and in establishing new moral concepts.

"A Little Revolutionary Small Talk with Young Comrades" is Comrade Peng Zhen's speech at the "December 9th" commemoration meeting of youths in the capital. He not only made an extremely insightful analysis of the history of the "December 9th" Movement, but also pointed out to us: If young students want to train themselves to become good people's cadres, they must first closely integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, becoming good students of Chairman Mao.

Engels' "Introduction to the Dialectics of Nature" is one of the important documents of Marxist-Leninist philosophy. It provides a popular overview of the history of natural science and is the best reference for everyone when studying dialectical materialism and historical materialism.

Zhang Zhongshi's "Commemorating Lenin" and another article "The Student Who Always Came First" are both short stories about Lenin. After reading them, we have a deep understanding of the personality and style of this great revolutionary saint, Lenin. In commemoration of the 26th anniversary of Lenin's death, these two articles are of even greater significance.

Starting with this issue, the journal will publish three serials: "Lectures on the History of Chinese Social Development," "Tempering," and "Biography of the Martyrs of Hu Long." "Lectures on the History of Chinese Social Development" is intended to help everyone learn about the history of social development. "Tempering" is a "first-person" novella that describes the process of an intellectual integrating with workers and peasants over the past twelve years. The picture story "Biography of the Martyrs of Hu Long" depicts the heroic deeds of the broad masses of peasants fighting against the enemy under the leadership of the Communist Party during the War of Resistance Against Japan.

In addition to the original "League Life" and "Mailbox" sections, it has also added "Life, Thought, and Learning" and "Chinese Youth Q&A" sections, making its content more lively.

In short, this issue of *China Youth* is more substantial than before. Developing in this direction, it will certainly provide greater assistance to young people in solving practical problems related to thought, life, work, and learning.

    《中国青年》第三十期
    静
    《中国青年》第三十期，已于最近出版。它自这一期起，改回半月一期，并在内容上有了极大的改进。
    在这一期，其内容是以新爱国主义为中心。萧德的“论中国人民的新爱国主义”及杨甫的“人民的新道德观”，对于解决大家在学习人民政协共同纲领中有关爱国主义与狭隘民族主义的一些思想问题，及建立新的道德观念，有着极大的帮助。
    “和青年同志们讲一点革命家常”是彭真同志在首都青年“一二九”纪念会上的讲话。他不仅对“一二九”的历史作了一个极其精湛的分析，并给我们指出：青年学生如要把自己锻炼成为好的人民干部，首先便必须要密切地与工农兵结合，认真学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，作毛主席的好学生。
    恩格斯的“自然辩证法导言”，是马列主义哲学的重要文献之一。它通俗地概述了自然科学的历史，是大家在学习辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义时最好的参考。
    张仲实的《纪念列宁》和另一篇《考第一的学生》，都是一些关于列宁的小故事，读后使我们对于这一位伟大的革命圣人——列宁的为人和作风，有了一个深刻的认识。为了纪念列宁逝世二十六周年，这两篇文章是更有重大意义的。
    从这一期开始，该刊发表了《中国社会发展史讲话》、《锻炼》、《虎龙英烈传》三种连载。《中国社会发展史讲话》是用以帮助大家对社会发展史学习的。《锻炼》是一篇“自叙体”的中篇小说，描写一个知识分子十二年来和工农结合的过程。图画故事《虎龙英烈传》，是表现抗战期中广大农民在共产党领导下与敌斗争的英勇史迹。
    此外，它除了原有的“团的生活”和“信箱”外，更添辟了“生活、思想、学习”和“中国青年问答”两栏，而使其内容更加生动活泼了。
    总之，这一期的《中国青年》是较前愈发充实了。朝着这一方向发展，它必会给青年解决思想、生活、工作、学习等实际问题以更大的帮助。
