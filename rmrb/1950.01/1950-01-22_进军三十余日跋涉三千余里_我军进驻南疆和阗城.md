    Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 21st: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has entered Hotan City in southern Xinjiang, bordering Tibet. This unit departed from Dunhuang, Gansu, and advanced on foot south of the Great Gobi along the highway, taking more than thirty days and marching over three thousand li. Before departure, the unit conducted extensive mobilization and discussions on overcoming difficulties, implementing policies, observing discipline, and completing the marching mission. Therefore, the morale of the entire army was extremely high during the march, with songs and slogans rising one after another along the way, maintaining an average marching speed of ninety to one hundred li per day. The cold wind in the Gobi area was biting, and some soldiers had cracks and blisters on their feet, and some had swollen legs, but no one fell behind. Villages and towns were sparse in the Gobi, and most of the time they camped by the roadside in the freezing weather; a certain regiment camped for thirteen days out of eighteen days of marching. During the march, all units resolutely implemented the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" and ethnic policies, and were supported by the people of all ethnic groups along the way. They set up reception stations along the way, preparing grain, firewood, water, cantaloupe, raisins, etc., to warmly receive the passing army. After the People's Liberation Army arrived in Hotan, it was warmly welcomed by more than 40,000 people.
    Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 20th: Delayed news: A part of the Fifth Army of the People's Liberation Army, reorganized from the Xinjiang National Army, was ordered to advance from northern Xinjiang to southern Xinjiang. After marching more than 500 li in ice and snow, it joined forces with a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Wensu City, southern Xinjiang. This unit departed from a certain place in northern Xinjiang on November 14th last year and traversed the vast Gobi Desert. At that time, the weather was freezing cold, and the roads were blocked by ice and snow, with the deepest snow reaching three chi. All commanders and fighters cleared the road with shovels and advanced, traveling only 160 li in twelve days. But the commanders and fighters were not afraid of difficulties and continued to shovel snow and move forward. After stepping onto the Daban Mountain in the Tianshan Mountains, which is 6,000 meters above sea level, the action became even more difficult. The mountains are covered with snow all year round, the climate is extremely cold, and the air is thin. When passing through the 25-li-long Daban mountain peak, it was snowing heavily, and there was only a narrow path for walking. It was difficult for livestock to pass, so the soldiers unloaded the mortars and heavy machine guns carried by the livestock and carried them on their own backs. When going down the mountain, fearing that the livestock would be injured, two or three people pulled a livestock to slide down the slope. After eighteen days of enduring wind and sleeping in the open, they finally completed the arduous march of more than 500 li and victoriously arrived in Wensu City, southern Xinjiang, on December 1st last year, where they were warmly welcomed by the people of Wensu and Aksu counties and more than 10,000 people of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wensu. The military headquarters of a certain army of the People's Liberation Army specially presented exquisite leader badges to all commanders and fighters of the unit as souvenirs of the meeting of the brotherly troops.

    进军三十余日跋涉三千余里
    我军进驻南疆和阗城
    【新华社迪化廿一日电】人民解放军某部已进驻新疆南部邻近西藏边境的和阗城。该部系由甘肃敦煌出发，沿公路由大戈壁以南徒步前进，历时卅余日，进军三千余里。在出发前，该部曾就克服困难、执行政策、遵守纪律、完成行军任务等展开广泛的动员和讨论。因此在行军中全军士气极高，沿途歌声口号声此起彼落，每天平均保持了九十至一百里的行军速度。戈壁区寒风刺骨，战士们的脚上有的裂了口，打了泡，有的腿走肿了，可是没有人掉队。戈壁中村镇稀少，大部分时间都露宿在天寒地冻的路旁；某团在行军十八天中，就露营十三天。在行军途中，各部坚决执行“三大纪律八项注意”和民族政策，受到沿途各地各族人民的拥护。他们在沿途设接待站，准备了粮食、柴、水、哈密瓜、葡萄干等，热烈接待过境大军。解放军抵达和阗后，受到四万余人民的热烈欢迎。
    【新华社迪化二十日电】迟到消息：由新疆民族军改编的人民解放军第五军一部，奉命由北疆进驻南疆，于冰雪中行军五百余里，已与南疆温宿城人民解放军某部会师。该部于去年十一月十四日由北疆某地出发，穿越瀚海戈壁。时值天寒地冻，道路为冰雪封塞，积雪最深处达三尺，全体指战员以铁铲开路前进，走了十二天只前进了一百六十里。但指战员们不畏艰难，继续铲雪前进。踏上拔海六千公尺的天山山脉的达坂山后，行动更为困难，山岭终年积雪，气候奇寒，空气稀薄。通过廿五里长的达坂山峰时，大雪纷飞，仅有一条羊肠小道可以行走，牲口很难通过，战士们将牲口驮的迫击炮、重机枪卸下来自己背起。下山时怕摔伤了牲口，由两三个人牵引一匹牲口滑着下坡。经十八天的风餐露宿，终于完成五百余里的艰苦行军，于去年十二月一日胜利到达南疆温宿城，当受到温宿、阿克苏两县人民和进驻温宿的人民解放军某部一万余人的热烈欢迎。人民解放军某军军部特以精制的领袖证章分赠该部全体指战员，作为兄弟部队会师的纪念品。
