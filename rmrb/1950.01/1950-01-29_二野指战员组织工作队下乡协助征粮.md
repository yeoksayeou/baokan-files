Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 27th—After basically completing the task of marching into the Southwest and annihilating the remaining bandits, the People's Liberation Army's Second Field Army quickly implemented work team missions. The various units have returned from the front lines to designated areas, and a large number of cadres and troops have begun to assist counties and districts in establishing local armed forces and actively participate in grain collection in their stationed areas. The direct units of the Field Army and the direct units of a certain corps have extracted more than 1,000 cadres and soldiers to form grain collection work teams, which went to the countryside on the 11th and 16th respectively to carry out their work. Before the departure of the brigades, they also studied policies related to grain collection. At the same time as the work teams went to the countryside, the political department of a certain corps also issued a special notice, calling on all its organs and troops to conduct extensive propaganda to the masses in their stationed areas, actively assist in grain collection, help transport and guard warehouses, and suppress saboteurs. In particular, commanders and fighters from Sichuan should take the lead in responding to the government's call, write letters to mobilize their families to enthusiastically pay public grain, and if their families are poor and exempt from payment, they should actively help the government promote grain payment work. Revolutionary soldiers and their families should become models in implementing the people's government's decrees and actively participating in the construction of new areas.

    二野指战员组织工作队下乡协助征粮
    【新华社重庆二十七日电】人民解放军第二野战军基本上完成进军西南歼灭残匪的任务后，迅速执行工作队任务。各部已分别由前线返回指定地区，大批干部及部队已开始协助各县区建立地方武装和积极参加驻区征粮等工作。野战军直属队及某兵团直属队抽调干部战士千余人，组成征粮工作队于十一日、十六日分别下乡展开工作。大队出发前并学习了与征粮有关的政策。与工作队下乡的同时，某兵团政治部并专门发出通知，号召所属各机关部队向驻地群众进行广泛宣传，积极协助征粮工作，帮助运输、看管仓库、镇压破坏分子。特别是四川籍指战员，更应带头响应政府号召，写信动员家庭踊跃缴纳公粮，家庭贫苦免缴的则应积极帮助政府推动缴粮工作。革命军人与家属应成为执行人民政府法令、积极参加新区地方建设的模范。
