Preventing Paralysis in Health Work
Liaoxi Military Region Health Department

(1) The Liaoxi Military Region Guard Regiment: Relapsing Fever Spread for Over Five Months

In the Liaoxi Military Region Guard Regiment, relapsing fever broke out in early June of last year. Due to the regiment's medical team's lax and paralyzed work, timely diagnosis and isolation were not carried out, lice were not thoroughly eliminated, disinfection was not adequately performed, the administrative side did not pay sufficient attention, and the headquarters did not carefully inspect the lower levels. This resulted in the continued spread of relapsing fever for more than five months. The number of cases was never completely counted, but it is estimated to be over fifty. The affected units included the Third Battalion headquarters and its affiliated Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Companies, as well as the regiment's directly subordinate training team. The Liaoxi Health Department sent personnel to the regiment on November 18th to assist in the capture and elimination of relapsing fever and to carry out intensive treatment. After two weeks of systematic work, the regiment's relapsing fever was eliminated.

The spread of this relapsing fever not only wasted manpower but also consumed a large amount of material, such as four to five tons of coal, three pounds of pure DDT, twelve pounds of 10% DDT, and over fifty pounds of 5% Lysol solution. It also affected the health of the troops and the training mission. This is a very serious problem!

(2) Route of Transmission

The first cases occurred in the Ninth Company, followed by the Seventh and Eighth Companies, and the regiment's directly subordinate training team. These were all new recruits from Changtu, Changbei, Tie嶺, and other places. According to the soldiers, they had been experiencing illness since mid-May when they were living in northern Tie嶺. In late May, they came to Jinzhou and were reorganized into the Third Battalion (Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Companies). At that time, more than twenty people fell ill, but no definitive diagnosis was made. A few days later, the troops departed for Heishan due to a mission. According to the battalion doctor, sometimes entire platoons were continuously falling ill. At that time, they were treated for febrile infectious diseases, and most recovered, with a few experiencing relapses. Three months later, the troops returned to Jinzhou, and in early November, the regiment established a training team. Sun Yutang, a soldier transferred from the Ninth Company of the Third Battalion, fell ill in the training team. Based on the above situation, it is proven that the regiment's relapsing fever was brought to the regiment by new recruits from Changtu, Changbei, Tie岭, and other places.

(3) Reasons for the Spread

	1.	Failure to Detect and Isolate/Treat Early: Initially, the illness was mistaken for a cold. After a consultation determined it to be relapsing fever, and after a blood test, it was precisely the patient's defervescence period. At that time, this point was not noticed, so spirochetes were not detected, which affected the definitive diagnosis of relapsing fever. The doctors remained in doubt, consistently treating it as a cold, focusing only on treatment and neglecting the important work of early detection and isolation.
	2.	Failure to Thoroughly Eliminate Lice and Disinfect: New recruits should undergo lice elimination and disinfection upon arrival, but the medical team and clinic neglected this issue, emphasizing objective reasons such as troop departures and unsuitable environments.
	3.	Paralysis in the Medical Team's Work: When so many cases occurred, appropriate measures were not taken. The team leader did not visit the companies, and even after a definitive diagnosis was made in mid-October (spirochetes were detected under a microscope), no isolation or general examination was carried out, and no thorough disinfection was performed. Only one lice elimination was done, with each person being given three watts of DDT, which was considered sufficient. Patients continued to fall ill, and excuses were made such as "no housing" and "the regiment is currently training," and things were allowed to drag on.
	4.	Medical Personnel Shifting Responsibility: The battalion doctor said, "We often made suggestions to the team leader, but he never gave instructions or solutions, so we had no way to proceed," leaving the actual work aside.
	5.	Insufficient Understanding of Health Work by the Administration: Because the relapsing fever did not become a major epidemic in the regiment, the administrative side did not pay much attention to it. For example, when the training team was established, people were still transferred from the Ninth Company, resulting in cases occurring in the training team. According to the doctors, suggestions had been made but were not adopted, and the administrative side also knew that relapsing fever was occurring in that company.
	6.	Lack of Attention to Physical Examinations: New recruits were assigned to the regiment without physical examinations, and patients were scattered in various companies.
	7.	Insufficiently Thorough Work by the Health Department: Although the headquarters arrived at various units to inspect the work, it failed to deeply understand the situation among the masses. Therefore, even though the regiment's relapsing fever continued for more than five months, the department would not have known about it if it had not convened a meeting of medical cadres from various units.

(4) The Process of Capture and Elimination

The main occurrence and spread were in the Third Battalion. According to the medical cadres at the meeting: in order to thoroughly capture and eliminate relapsing fever (with the added benefit of intensive treatment for scabies), we first went through the mobilization of the regiment leaders, made a report at the administrative cadre meeting, and raised the reasons for the spread of the disease, its transmission route, and the methods of capture and elimination. Secondly, the regiment leaders told the cadres: "We must capture and eliminate relapsing fever and carry out intensive treatment for scabies, treating this work as the central task of the troops, and carrying it out like a combat mission." All medical personnel were divided into five groups (inspection group, treatment group, propaganda group, disinfection group, and preparation group), focusing on early detection and isolation, and thorough lice elimination and disinfection.

The inspection group examined a total of more than twenty suspected cases, all of whom lived within the companies. Measures were taken to isolate them, and nine were diagnosed as relapsing fever (spirochetes were detected under a microscope). Treatment was immediately carried out after isolation.

Taking the battalion as a unit, cadres and soldiers thoroughly bathed. After bathing, the treatment group sprinkled DDT on everyone, changed them into clean clothes, which were inspected by the diagnosis group, and the disinfection group and instructors collected the changed shirts and dirty items in the dormitory, boiled them in a pot, dried the quilts, and used 5% Lysol solution to disinfect the barracks after they were cleaned. Soldiers had their heads shaved.

The above work started on November 28th and took four days to complete lice elimination and disinfection for all 2,870 cadres and soldiers in the regiment. After another week of continuous inspections, no new cases were found. Therefore, we believe that relapsing fever has been eliminated.

This lesson should alert us in our future work to strengthen awareness and work on health and epidemic prevention, so that similar problems do not occur again, in order to cooperate with the smooth completion of the troops' training mission. (Reprinted from Shenyang Health News)

Editor's Note: This article, in a spirit of self-criticism, exposes the shortcomings of some medical personnel who adopt only symptomatic treatment for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and also proves that treatment work must be given the same importance as prevention work in order to exert the effect of preventing diseases. This experience is worthy of attention by medical personnel in various regions.

    防止卫生工作上的麻痹现象
    辽西军区卫生部
            （一）辽西军区警卫团  回归热蔓延五个多月
    辽西军区警卫团，去年六月上旬起发生回归热，由于团卫生队工作疲塌麻痹，未及时确诊隔离，彻底灭虱消毒，行政方面不十分重视及本部对下层检查工作不细心，使回归热继续不断的流行五个多月，发生数字始终没有完整的统计，估计在五十余名，发生的单位有第三营营部及所属的七、八、九连和团直属轮训队。辽西卫生部于十一月十八日派员去该团协助进行捕灭回归热及突击治疗工作，经历两周有步骤的工作，该团回归热已被捕灭。
    这次回归热的蔓延，不仅浪费了人力，又消耗大量的物质，如消耗煤四—五吨，纯ＤＤＴ三磅，１０％ＤＤＴ十二磅，５％的来苏儿液五十余磅，还影响部队健康和练兵任务，这是多么严重的问题啊！
            （二）传染的经路
    首先发生是在第九连，接续是七、八连及团直属的轮训队，都是由昌图、昌北、铁岭等处来的新兵，据战士们谈他们来时在五月中旬住在铁岭北就有的发病，五月下旬来到锦州，改编为第三营（七、八、九连），当时发病二十多名，没能确诊，过数日部队因有任务出发到黑山，据该营医生谈：有时一排一排的接继不断的发病，当时以热性传染病治疗，大部分好了，有少数的反复发生，过三个月后部队回到锦州，于十一月初旬团里成立轮训队，由第三营九连调来的战士孙玉堂在轮训队发病。根据以上情况证明该团的回归热是昌图、昌北、铁岭等处的新兵带到团里来的。
            （三）蔓延原因
    １、未能早期发现和隔离治疗，最初发现病时以为是感冒，经过会诊确定为回归热，又经过验血，正是患者的退热期，当时未能注意这点，所以未验出螺旋体，以致影响了回归热的确诊，医生始终在疑惑中，一直的以感冒处置，只顾治疗，竟把早期发现和隔离重要工作忽略了。
    ２、未能彻底灭虱和消毒，刚入伍的新兵，应当作一次灭虱消毒，而卫生队及医务所竟忽视了这一问题，并强调部队出发及环境不允许等客观原因。
    ３、卫生队本身工作麻痹。当时发病的那么多，没能采取适当的处置办法，队长未下过连队看看，并且在十月中旬已经确诊（经镜检验出螺旋体）也没隔离，没有普遍检诊，更没彻底消毒，只做过一次灭虱，每人发下三瓦ＤＤＴ就算了事，患者仍然继续发生，只强调没房子，团里又正在练兵等，就这样拖延下去。
    ４、医务人员互相推脱责任，营内医生说：“我们时常向队长提出建议，他始终就没有指示和解决，我们也没办法”，把实际工作扔在一边。
    ５、行政上对卫生工作的认识不够。这次回归热因为在团里没有大流行，所以行政方面就不太重视，如成立轮训队时，还从第九连调人，结果在轮训队发病，据医生们谈，已提出过建议亦未采纳，并且行政方面也知道那连里有回归热发生。
    ６、没注意身体检查，在新兵入伍时不经身体检查即编到团里来，并且把病人也散布在各连。
    ７、卫生部工作不够深入。本部虽到达各单位检查工作，未能深入到群众中了解，所以该团虽然回归热继续五个多月，部里如果不召集各单位医务干部会议，依然不知道该团有回归热。
            （四）捕灭的经过
    发生与蔓延主要的是第三营，据医务干部会议时谈：我们为的要彻底捕灭回归热（附带突击治疗疥号）首先经过团首长的动员，行政干部会上做报告，并提出该病在团里蔓延原因及传染经路、捕灭的办法，其次由团首长给干部讲：“我们一定要捕灭回归热和突击治疗疥号，把这项工作当做部队的中心任务，当战斗任务一样来进行”。把所有的医务人员分成五个组（检查组、治疗组、宣传组、消毒组、准备组），着重早期发现和隔离，彻底灭虱消毒。
    由检查组前后共检查出疑似二十余名，都住在连队内，即设法加以隔离，其中确诊九名为回归热（经镜验出螺旋体）隔离后马上进行治疗。
    以营为单位，干部与战士都彻底洗澡，洗完澡治疗组在每人身上撒以ＤＤＴ，更换清洁衣服，由检诊组检查，由消毒组及指导员收集换下来的衬衣、宿舍内的脏东西用锅煮沸，晒被子，营舍打扫清洁后，用５％的来苏儿液消毒。战士一律剃光头。
    上项工作是从十一月二十八日开始，经过四天把全团干部战士二八七○人都灭虱消毒完了，后又继续检查一周，始终没有发病者，所以我们认为回归热已被捕灭。
    这次教训值得我们今后在工作上警惕，加强卫生防疫的认识与工作，不让再有类似问题发生，以配合部队练兵任务顺利完成。（转载沈阳健康报）
    按：本文以自我批评的精神，揭露了某些医务人员对疾病的诊断治疗只采取对症疗法的缺点，也证明了治疗工作必须与预防工作同样注重，才能发挥防止疾病的效用，这个经验，值得各地医务人员注意。
