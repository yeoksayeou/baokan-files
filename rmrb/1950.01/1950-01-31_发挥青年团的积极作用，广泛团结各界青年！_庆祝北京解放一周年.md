Give play to the positive role of the Youth League, and widely unite young people from all walks of life!
--Celebrating the first anniversary of the liberation of Beijing--
*Beijing Youth* Editorial

It has been a year since the liberation of Beijing. From the May Fourth Movement, the December 9th Movement, until the anti-American and anti-Chiang struggles before liberation, Beijing students have always stood at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In the struggle, they formed a strong underground organization of the Communist Party, and powerful secret youth groups led by the Communist Party, such as the "Minqing" and "Minlian," emerged. The Beijing Youth League was first established on this basis and under the leadership and assistance of the Central Committee of the Youth League and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party. Within a year, the number of Youth League members in Beijing has grown from more than 3,000 to more than 22,400; from being mainly students to including workers, peasants, and advanced youth from all walks of life; and has become a powerful assistant to the Party and the People's Government and the Party's reserve force, forming a youth team trusted and welcomed by the broad masses of young people. Over the past year, its work in schools has been centered on learning. In the early days of liberation, it helped establish a democratic and conscious learning order. It played an important role in assisting the administration in establishing and mobilizing League members to take the lead in studying political classes. In particular, last summer, it organized 13,000 students for vacation learning, helping the vast majority of students take a big step forward in transforming their thinking and establishing a revolutionary outlook on life. After the start of the autumn semester, an unprecedented upsurge of learning emerged in universities and middle schools, and League members played a leading role in carrying out New Democracy studies. In factories, League members have become a leading force in production, playing a significant role in security and recreational activities. In rural areas in the suburbs and in government offices, Youth League members have become reliable assistants to the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party. In voluntary labor and various social movements, Youth League members are active participants. In one year, the Beijing Municipal Youth League has also provided 2,900 cadres to the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party (more than 10,000 students were mobilized to participate in the South Work Group, Hua University, and various work posts in the early days of liberation). The work of the Youth League over the past year shows that with its own organization of activists, the youth can play an assistant role for the broad masses of youth in revolutionary construction work.

But in order to further improve the work of the Youth League, what are the main tasks at present?

First, further give play to the positive role of the Beijing Municipal Youth League. Since the main tasks of Beijing at present are economic construction and cultural construction, which are arduous and meticulous tasks, Youth League members on all fronts must complete the work tasks of the government and the Party according to various specific circumstances, and strengthen their studies in conjunction with practical work. This can no longer be solved by a movement or a simple "general appeal." In addition, since last summer, especially after the call to oppose closed-doorism, the development of League members has been very rapid, and a large number of new League members have poured into the League. Although most of them are actively striving for progress, they lack the basic knowledge of self-cultivation that League members must understand, and although they have a high degree of enthusiasm for work, they do not understand work methods. This makes it difficult to improve the level of work. How to solve it? First of all, we must make every effort to strengthen branch work, improve branch life, and give play to the role of the branch. Each branch should form the core of the youth masses in its unit, and each branch should have the ability to implement the policies of the Party and League superiors in a concrete way, and to carry out work proactively under certain principles. This is a basic link in improving the level of the League's work. Secondly, we should greatly strengthen education within the League, and improve League members' study of Marxism-Leninism, basic League knowledge, League member self-cultivation and work methods. To this end, special personnel must be set up to give lectures on tour, help with discussions, compile and print League reading materials, and strengthen cadre training (the cadre education of school leagues is mainly carried out during winter and summer vacations). Only when the role of the branches is improved, the level of the vast number of League members' Marxism-Leninism study and work is improved, and the League's active role and core role can be greatly played, can we better complete the tasks given by the government and the Party.

Second, widely unite young people from all walks of life to participate in production and construction and strengthen learning. The vast number of young people from all walks of life have made great progress in the year since liberation. They are eager to participate in production and construction, and strengthen their political, cultural, and technical studies. In addition, there are many practical problems (such as dropping out of school, unemployment, marriage, and family problems, etc.) that need help to solve and guidance. Only by uniting together can the vast number of young people give play to their strength and provide necessary and possible solutions to these problems. Therefore, the Youth League should assist the preparatory committee of the Democratic Youth Federation in convening various youth representative meetings and youth symposiums, and on this basis, convene a city-wide youth representative congress. We must listen to the opinions and demands of the broad masses of young people, and treat this work with a serious and responsible spirit to solve the difficulties for the youth masses. All Youth League members in factories, rural areas, schools, and government offices must continue to strengthen their ties with the masses, strengthen the study of the mass line ideology, care about the immediate welfare of the masses (such as mass recreational activities, production and consumer cooperatives in schools, improving nutrition, etc.), strengthen youth service work, and strengthen ties with sports circles, music circles, and other youth groups.

In order to successfully undertake new work tasks, leading organs at all levels must improve their work methods. Work should have a center, a plan (which can be supervised and checked on time), and a focus (not only general appeals, but also specific guidance). Give play to the role of each organization, and establish and improve the work system (such as defining the scope of work and cooperative relations of each department, and establishing a good style of the League by combining rewards, criticisms, and self-criticisms). Appropriately convene League representative meetings, and strengthen democratic life within the League. Strengthen the organization and discipline of League members.

The second year of Beijing's liberation has begun. Everyone should strive to improve the level of work, and under the leadership of the Party, with the help and cooperation of all parties, welcome the upsurge of economic construction and the upsurge of cultural construction, and give play to the strength of Beijing youth!

    发挥青年团的积极作用，广泛团结各界青年！
    ——庆祝北京解放一周年——
    《北京青年》社论
    北京解放已满一年了。北京学生从“五四”“一二九”直到解放前反美反蒋的斗争中，始终站在反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义斗争的前列，并在斗争中形成强大的共产党的地下组织，出现了强大的、为共产党所领导的“民青”“民联”的秘密青年团体。北京的青年团首先是在这一基础上并在团中央与共产党北京市委的领导与帮助之下建立起来的。一年之内，北京市的青年团员已由三千多人发展到两万二千四百多人；由学生成份为主发展到包括工人、农民和各界的先进青年；并且已经形成为党与人民政府的有力助手和党的后备军，形成为被广大青年群众信任与欢迎的青年队伍了。一年来它在学校里的工作，是以学习为中心的。在解放初期的庆祝高潮之后，帮助建立了民主自觉的学习秩序。在协助行政建立与发动团员带头学习政治课方面起了重要的作用，尤其是去年暑期组织了一万三千学生的假期学习，帮助广大同学在改造思想建立革命人生观方面大大前进了一步。秋季始业后的大中学校中普遍出现了空前的学习的热潮，团员们在开展新民主主义学习中，起了带头作用。在工厂中团员成为生产中带头突击的力量，在保卫与文娱工作上起了显著的作用。在郊区农村中，在机关工作中，青年团员都已形成人民政府与中国共产党的可靠的助手。在义务劳动与各种社会运动中，青年团员都是积极的参加者。一年间，北京市青年团并给人民政府与中国共产党输送了二千九百名干部（解放初期动员参加南工团、华大等校及各种工作岗位的万余学生在外）。一年来青年团的工作，说明了青年有了自己的积极分子组织，就能发挥广大青年在革命建设工作中的助手作用。
    但为了更进一步提高青年团的工作，当前的主要任务是什么呢？
    第一，进一步发挥北京市青年团的积极作用。由于北京当前的主要任务是经济建设与文化建设，这是艰巨而细致的工作，而各个战线上的青年团员必须根据各种不同的具体情况，完成政府和党的工作任务。并结合实际工作加强学习。这不再是一个运动或简单的“一般号召”所能解决问题的。加以自从去年暑假，特别是反关门主义的号召以后，团员的发展很迅速，大量新团员涌进团内，虽然他们大多是积极要求进步，但缺少团员必须了解的基本修养知识，虽有高度的工作热情，但不懂得工作方法。这就使得工作水平很难提高。怎样解决呢？首先是以全力来加强支部工作，健全支部生活，发挥支部的作用，每一支部应形成为所在单位中青年群众的核心，应使每一支部具有这样一种工作能力，即能够把党团上级方针具体执行，并能在一定原则下主动进行工作。这是一个提高团的工作水平的基本环节。其次，应当大大加强团内的教育，提高团员对马列主义、团的基本知识、团员修养与工作方法的学习，为此，须设专人进行巡回讲课，帮助讨论，编印团内读物，加强干部训练工作（学校团的干部教育主要是在寒暑假中进行）。只有支部的作用提高了，广大团员马列主义学习及工作水平提高了，团的积极作用与核心作用才能大大发挥，才能更好地完成政府和党所给的任务。
    第二，广泛团结各界青年群众，参加生产建设，加强学习。广大的各界青年在解放以来的一年中有了巨大的进步，他们迫切要求参加生产建设，加强政治、文化、技术的学习，此外他们存在着的许多切身问题（如失学、失业、婚姻、家庭问题等）需要帮助解决与指导。广大青年只有团结起来，才能发挥出自己的力量，将这些问题给以必要和可能的解决。因此，青年团应协助民主青年联合会筹委会，召开各种的青年代表会议与青年座谈会，并在此基础上召开全市青年代表大会。必须倾听广大青年的意见与要求，并采取认真负责为青年群众解决困难的精神来对待这一工作。而所有工厂农村学校机关的青年团员，都必须继续加强与群众的联系，加强群众路线的思想学习，关心群众切身福利问题（如群众的康乐活动、学校内的生产与消费合作社、改善营养等），加强青年服务工作，加强与体育界音乐界及其他青年团体的联系。
    为了能胜利地担当新的工作任务，各级领导机关必须改善工作方法。工作应有中心，有计划（可以按时督促检查），有重点（不是只有一般号召，而且有具体指导）。发挥各个组织的作用，建立与健全工作制度（如确立各部门工作范围与分工合作的关系，以奖励批评与自我批评结合的方法来建立团的优良作风）。适当召开团的代表会议，加强团内民主生活。加强团员的组织性与纪律性。
    北京解放的第二年开始了，大家努力把工作水平提高一步，在党的领导下，在各方帮助与配合下，迎接经济建设高潮与文化建设的高潮，发挥出北京青年的力量！
