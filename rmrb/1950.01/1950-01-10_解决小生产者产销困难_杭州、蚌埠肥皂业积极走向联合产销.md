    Solving Production and Sales Difficulties for Small Producers
    Hangzhou and Bengbu Soap Industries Actively Move Towards Joint Production and Sales
    [This newspaper dispatch] To reduce costs, improve quality, and open up sales channels, the soap industries in Hangzhou and Bengbu are actively moving towards joint production and sales. There are more than thirty soap factories in Hangzhou, most of which are handmade except for a few mechanized ones. The quality is low and the varieties are numerous. Furthermore, due to the current off-season, sales are sluggish, and production is facing great difficulties. In order to improve the technology of the Hangzhou soap industry and quickly open up sales channels, the Provincial Industrial Raw Materials and Finished Products Supply and Marketing Department and the Hangzhou Production Promotion Department established the Hangzhou Soap Industry Joint Production and Sales Committee on the 6th of last month. It was determined that in terms of production, the principles would be unified products and improved technology; in terms of raw material supply, the focus would be on joint procurement; and in terms of finished product sales, the method of unified trademarks and centralized sales would be adopted, and a distribution office would be established. After more than half a month of efforts, under the guidance of technicians at the office, the first batch of experimental products was manufactured in the latter half of last month. According to laboratory results, the results were excellent, and it has now been decided to adopt the "Joint Brand" as the trademark for official sale.
    In addition, under the guidance and assistance of the Bengbu Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, twenty-two private soap factories in Bengbu also prepared to establish a joint supply and marketing office in mid-December of last year, and officially started business at the beginning of this month. The establishment of a joint supply and marketing office in this industry dates back to July of last year. Because most of the businesses in this industry are small-scale factories, they are greatly restricted in terms of capital turnover and raw material procurement and finished product sales, and are subject to heavy intermediate exploitation, which invisibly increases the burden on producers and consumers and seriously affects sales. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce suggested that the industry organize joint operations to collectively purchase raw materials and sell finished products, but this could not be realized due to inconsistent opinions within the industry. By early December of last year, due to the arrival of the off-season and sales problems, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce suggested once again organizing joint operations to solve the current production and sales difficulties. After extensive discussions within the industry, a joint supply and marketing office was established in the middle of the month, and the organizational rules were unanimously approved. In addition to the existing 22 shareholders and approximately 100 boxes of soap as shares, the Guanghua and Xinghua factories, which had originally applied to cease operations, have also reapplied to resume operations in view of the great help this type of operation provides to small producers.

    解决小生产者产销困难
    杭州、蚌埠肥皂业积极走向联合产销
    【本报讯】杭州、蚌埠两市肥皂业，为降低成本，提高质量及打开销路起见，正积极走向联合产销。杭州市肥皂厂共有三十余家，除少数机制者外，余皆为手工制造，品质低劣而且名目繁多，又由于目前已临淡季，销售呆滞，生产发生极大困难。省工业原料成品供销处及杭州市生产推进处为了改进杭市肥皂工业技术及迅速打开销路起见，于上月六日成立杭州市肥皂工业联合产销委员会，确定在生产方面，以统一产品、改进技术为原则；在原料供给方面，则以共同采购为主；在成品推销方面，则以划一商标，集中推销方式经营，并成立发行处。经半月多的努力，在该处技师指导下，第一批试验品已于上月下旬制成，据化验结果，成绩优良，现已决定采取联合牌为商标，正式出售。
    又蚌埠二十二家私营肥皂厂，亦已在该市工商局指导与帮助下，于去年十二月中旬，筹组联合供销处，本月初即开始正式营业。又该业之成立联合供销处，早在去年七月，由于该业多系规模较小厂家，在资金周转与原料采购成品推销上均受到很大限制，且受到重重的中间剥削，无形中加重生产者与消费者负担，并严重影响了销路，该市工商局即曾建议该业组织联营集体采购原料及推销成品，因该业意见不一致，未能实现。及至去年十二月初，由于淡季来临，销售发生问题，经工商局再度建议，组织联营以解决目前产销困难。俟经该业展开广泛讨论后，始于月中组成联合供销处，并一致通过组织章则。现该业除已有股东二十二家及股金约计肥皂一百箱外，连原先已申请歇业的光华、兴华二厂，因鉴于此种经营方式对小生产者帮助甚大均又复申请复业。
