Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: TASS, Shanghai, 4th: The Japanese "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper published a statement by a former Japanese army medical corps sergeant, Nakanishi. He said: Nanjing also had a large factory that manufactured bacteriological weapons for the army. These weapons were tested on Chinese prisoners of war. Nakanishi learned of this from several members of the special unit that served in this factory. They told him that when the Soviet Union joined the war against Japan, the factory was completely destroyed. An Associated Press reporter reported: Shiro Ishii, who played a major role in the bacteriological warfare work, has disappeared from his home. According to MacArthur Headquarters, Ishii's whereabouts are "unknown."
