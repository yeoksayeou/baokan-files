    American Labor Marches Forward
    By William Z. Foster, Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States
    (Editor's note: This is Chapter 5 of "The Twilight of World Capitalism," a recent book by Comrade Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States. The book was published at the end of June 1949. The entire book contains twelve chapters, totaling approximately 130,000 words.)

    The modern American trade union movement originated with the expansion of increasingly developed large industries and labor struggles after the Civil War, and it was organized on a national scale in the year I was born. On November 15, 1881, the American Federation of Labor was established in Pittsburgh. Throughout my life, in fact, since the age of fourteen, I have had a deep and close relationship with the American trade union movement. At one point, from 1917 to 1920, I was the organizing director of the meatpacking and steel industries for the American Federation of Labor. We organized 200,000 meatpacking workers and 367,000 steel workers, marking the first time the American labor movement organized workers in modern, trustified large-scale production industries.

    During the Roosevelt administration, especially from 1930 to 1940, trade unions made a great stride forward by organizing workers in basic industries. For a long time, the fact that workers were unorganized in these industries served as a powerful weapon for capitalists to use against labor. For many years, the absence of strong trade unions in large trustified industries gave capitalists a great advantage. Big capitalists were able to set wages as they saw fit for millions of workers in these unorganized industries, thereby negatively affecting the wage standards of the entire working class. Employers were also able to hinder the organic development of the entire labor movement and obstruct its political activities. Although workers in these basic industries have been organized, the monopolistic capitalists have never completely lost their control over the workers, because the trade unions are generally controlled by conservative leaders. Many of these high-level leaders are easily susceptible to capitalist temptation and pressure. However, the organization of workers in basic industries has given the working class a powerful weapon, and the working class will learn how to use this weapon effectively at every appropriate opportunity. The American labor movement now possesses enormous potential.

    In recent years, there have been two major, related democratic movements: the tremendous development of trade unions and the political activism of Black people.

    The great development of trade unions has resulted in countless important victories for workers. Working conditions have been improved, basic safety conditions have been established, preliminary social insurance systems have begun to be implemented, and seniority regulations have been formulated. However, the most important achievement that workers have won in the last generation (second only to the establishment of trade unions themselves) is the shortening of the workday and workweek. Today, the system of eight-hour workdays and five-day workweeks has become common, which is a huge improvement compared to the situation when I was an industrial worker. For example, when I worked on the railroad more than thirty years ago (I worked on the railroad for a full ten years), we worked twelve hours a day and had no days off in a month. During the great steel strike of 1919-1920, the main demand of the 367,000 striking workers (besides the recognition of their right to organize unions) was the abolition of the system of twelve-hour workdays and seven-day workweeks, which was then universally practiced in the entire steel industry. Naturally, all these achievements are constantly endangered by the reactionary economic and political forces active in capitalist society.

    Another major democratic movement in recent years (which is closely linked to the tremendous development of trade unions) is the political advancement of Black people. This is one of the most noteworthy aspects of the entire American political situation. The exceptional upsurge of the Black masses in politics and culture, who were only recently liberated from actual enslavement, is manifested in every aspect. Black people, in cooperation with progressive white people, are playing an increasingly effective role in many fields. They have become a genuine factor in the trade union movement (primarily in basic industries). They have also produced some of our country's most outstanding scientists. They rank among the best in our culture (especially in music and drama). They are adept in sports, and they are destroying the system of discrimination against Black people throughout the country (especially in the feudalistic South). These advances of Black people (which have been bravely and cleverly won) have made them leaders among the most progressive strata of the American people. However, the discrimination they suffer is still particularly severe. Because the status of Black people in the industrial centers is extremely low, this political awakening is of great importance to organized labor.

    Since its inception, the labor movement has had to develop under the resistance of the most powerful bourgeoisie the world has ever seen. In this long and arduous struggle, the labor movement has given workers a lot of protection, but it has not reached full maturity in this regard. Its conservative leadership has not fully utilized the powerful potential of trade unions. In an economic sense, the movement is relatively strong, but in the basic aspects of ideology, organization, and politics, it has not yet developed. It is also weak in leadership. Therefore, a broad labor movement and a democratic alliance based on workers cannot decisively challenge the capitalists, who remain a politically strong class in our country with solid defenses. The organized American working class has not yet achieved its historical mission of becoming the leader of the nation, nor has it defined this broad goal as the purpose of its efforts.

            The basic flaw of trade unions under conservative leadership is ideological immaturity.

    The primary and most fundamental flaw of trade unions is ideological immaturity. Most of our country's workers have not severed their spiritual connection with capitalism. They do not have a concrete socialist vision, and they do not have class consciousness. Although they have a strong class nature and an excellent proletarian fighting spirit, they have not drawn a clear ideological line between themselves and the bourgeoisie. This ideological backwardness is a serious obstacle to trade unions. Trade unions reflect and clearly express the complete ideological confusion of workers in their formal programs and leadership. This is a weakness that deeply undermines the struggle of trade unions in all aspects.

    The basic reason for this ideological immaturity of American men and women workers is the strength of the American capitalist system, which is relatively stronger than in any other country. The majority of the American working class, especially the more skilled workers, have long shared in the benefits of "prosperity" that have accompanied our country's developing capitalism. As we have seen in the above chapters, this "prosperity" has largely arisen from the war and the rebuilding of war damage in the last generation. Workers' wages have been almost higher than in any other country in the world for a long period of time. Many workers have also enjoyed special opportunities to become economically more privileged than the working class. For example, at present, many workers in our country are undoubtedly sharing in the "good times" of American capitalism, which are based on the war disasters suffered by the people of other countries in World War II. In addition to these facts, there may be the following other facts that hinder the ideological maturity of American workers: There is a large influx of workers from many countries into our country, and they have different political, religious, and social backgrounds. Therefore, it is not surprising that the progress of class consciousness among American workers is slow, and that they do not understand the urgent necessity of socialism. The majority of workers learn about things not from Marxist books or propaganda, but from their daily lives.

    The bourgeoisie's claim that there are no classes and no class struggle in America is, of course, ignorant and ridiculous. Here, as in other capitalist countries, there are clearly defined social classes, and there is a constant struggle between them for the distribution of the products of labor and the struggle for political control. In this country, we have a powerful, clearly marked bourgeoisie, who are the richest, most powerful, and most arrogant in the world. We also have a large and diverse middle class. There is also a peasant class, with poor and rich strata. Finally, we have a great working class (men and women), who labor in industry all their lives, who come from working-class families, and who fully expect to remain workers until they die. Each of these classes has its own clear political views, and there is often a more or less active struggle between them to improve their respective positions. This is class struggle. And this is as plain as seeing Plymouth Rock when you see America.

    The existence of the labor movement and its long history of arduous strikes are sufficient proof that there are classes and class struggle in this country. Admittedly, some countries have more violent class struggles than the United States. The problem is that American workers have not drawn sufficient ideological meaning from the class struggle they are engaged in. The failure of workers to recognize their class position in capitalist America is one of the greatest assets of employers. Employers and their spokespersons (the most important of whom are conservative labor leaders) fully recognize this and spare no effort, money, or effort to prevent workers from breaking free from their current ideological confusion. A more foolish attempt to persuade workers that there are no classes and no class struggle in the United States is the writing of Mr. Murray, president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Mr. Murray wrote in the June 1948 issue of *The American Magazine*:

    "In fact, there are no classes in our country; this is the reason why so few people believe in Marx's theory of class struggle. We are all workers. And, in the final analysis, the interests of farmers, factory workers, merchants, freelancers, and clerks are the same. Even dividing the personnel in the industry into 'managers' and 'workers' proves to be somewhat artificial. As we have already discovered, there are a lot of workers among the managers, and there are a lot of managers among the workers."

    However, American workers are by no means irrevocably attached to the illusions of capitalists. They are making clear progress ideologically. As American and world capitalism sink deeper into trouble, and as their working and living conditions are threatened, the workers of this country are beginning to understand how to improve their class position and to recognize the basic weaknesses of the capitalist system. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the Roosevelt era that followed, workers' confidence in capitalism was greatly shaken. The fact that there were seventeen million unemployed people in a collapsed economic system was a powerful teacher. Workers have learned that they can no longer expect capitalism to give them even reasonably stable jobs. They have now obtained the belief (based on Roosevelt's Keynesian plans) that they can only enjoy even temporary minimum economic security through state intervention in industry and the adoption of appropriate social insurance systems.

    This clear recognition of certain basic weaknesses of capitalism marks a great step forward in the thinking of workers. In fact, it opens the door to their politicization and to ideological development (which must eventually lead to class consciousness and a socialist vision). American workers are evolving in a way that is at least in some ways similar to what their British brothers have experienced. About thirty years ago, British employers used to boast loudly that their workers were immune to socialism; Marxism was a foreign "-ism" and could never take root in the soil of incorrigible capitalism. However, once the British Empire began to decline, unable to buy off skilled workers with high wages, nor to generally give workers stable jobs, British workers began to understand their class position more clearly and began to turn to socialism en masse. Today, even their right-wing social democratic leaders are betraying them, but the workers truly desire to implement socialism in Britain. In effect, this is the general path that American workers are taking. When American capitalism is in obvious distress, then American workers will quickly have socialist ideas.

    The development of a socialist worldview among American workers will greatly stimulate the growth of the labor movement. It will cause a genuine labor revival in this country. And we can confidently assume that this revival will certainly occur on an increasing scale. American capitalism is not "exceptional," and American workers are not exceptional. Although there are certain special national characteristics, they are basically affected by the same economic, political, and ideological laws as capitalism and workers in other countries. American capitalism is inevitably heading for an eventual crisis from which it will not be able to recover. The ultimate ideological aim of American workers, developed in the course of these events, will be a socialist vision and a struggle to win the working class's leadership over the American people. Spokespersons for the National Association of Manufacturers may laugh at this terrible (for them) prediction, but they will have to accept this particular event that they detest so much at the appropriate time.

            The second weakness of the trade union movement lies in the low quality and quantity of labor's economic organization.

    The second major weakness of the American trade union movement—which arises from the first basic ideological weakness—lies in the low quality and quantity of labor's economic organization. Although trade unions have a total of 15 million members, there are still more eligible workers who have not joined unions than that number. These unorganized workers are a major obstacle to the effectiveness of trade union activities. The fact that they have not been organized is mainly due to the serious negligence of the conservative trade union leadership. Undoubtedly, if the bureaucratized trade union executives moved from their swivel chairs and spent a little time doing organizational work, millions more workers could be absorbed into the trade unions. In addition to this unnecessary quantitative weakness, the trade unions, especially those belonging to the American Federation of Labor and the Railroad Labor Unions, are divided into the kind of old-fashioned craft unions of 1890 or earlier. The retention of this outdated form of organization is mainly because a whole group of well-paid trade union executives want to maintain their useless positions for workers. Craft unionism is a serious weakness for labor, especially during difficult strikes. When other people are striking, strikes repeatedly suffer disastrous failures because some workers continue to work. Finally, organized workers are cut in half into two mutually competitive camps—the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Apart from the fraud perpetrated by rival workers' bureaucracies (mainly the leaders of the American Federation of Labor, who are trying to maintain the interests of their own group, regardless of the well-being of the workers), there is no basis for the continuation of this division (which has caused immeasurable harm to workers and was created by the reactionary leaders of the American Federation of Labor). Although American organized workers seem to be making slow progress, they are, like labor in other countries, safely moving towards the road of striving for large-scale movements, industrial organization methods, and the establishment of a national general union.

            The third weakness of organized labor is the failure to form a broad mass party in the political sphere.

    The third serious shortcoming of organized labor is in the political sphere. The American working class is the only major working class in the capitalist world that has not organized itself into a broad mass political party. Labor in this country still follows the bourgeois political parties and is fooled by the complex machinery of the two-party system. The ideological immaturity of the working class is the basic reason for this situation, and the direct cause is the obstructive attitude of the reactionary trade union leadership. If these leaders boldly organized a new people's party headed by workers, the workers would undoubtedly support it in large numbers from the outset, making it a decisive political force. However, these leaders refuse to do so, mostly because their personal interests are inextricably linked to these two bourgeois political parties.

    Organizations such as the Political Action Committee of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the Labor Political Education League of the American Federation of Labor are completely inadequate to meet the political demands of workers. They are like windmills in the age of atomic energy. A new party must be formed, including workers, farmers, Black people, intellectuals, and other democratic forces. The Progressive Party led by Wallace is a step in the right direction. The time to organize such a party is ripe, and the workers are moving towards the establishment of such a party, although at a very slow pace, despite the joint opposition of their reactionary trade union leaders and bourgeois politicians.

    The two-party system is the apple of the capitalist's eye in terms of maintaining political control over workers. They use all means to bind the masses to it. Because of the tricks of this two-party system, they are constantly forcing workers to choose between "two evils." They offer two sets of reactionary candidates to run for election. If workers object and refuse to vote for the reactionary who is considered the lesser evil, then they are threatened with electing the candidate who is the greater evil, that is, electing an even more reactionary person to power. This is a deadly political trap. The role of the two-party system is to sink workers deeper into the quagmire of reaction. In the recent national election, there was no real choice between Truman and Dewey, as workers will soon understand from Truman's abandonment of his campaign promises. It is this policy of "choosing between two evils" that has led the German Social Democratic Party to support reactionary elements who are worse and worse. They finally destroyed themselves by voting for Hindenburg. Because Hindenburg immediately appointed Hitler as his Prime Minister and handed Germany over to fascism. Workers must bravely leave the vicious circle of the two-party system, leave the policy of "choosing between two evils," and establish their own independent united party. Otherwise, because the monopoly capitalists control the two major parties, and because these big capitalists are moving towards fascism step by step, the policy of "choosing between two evils" and the two-party system can only bring successive failures to the American working class. The coming of age of American labor will be marked by the establishment of its own party. This will be a step of great importance to the labor movement. Only by establishing such an independent party can American labor truly resist arrogant trusts, effectively defend the interests of workers, and fulfill the national leadership responsibility that is increasingly placed upon it.

    The fourth weakness of organized labor is the lack of truly working-class economic and political policies.

    The fourth major weakness of organized labor, another symbol of its immaturity, is its lack of genuinely working-class economic and political policies. The formal policies of trade unions today, despite their demands for reforms for workers, are fundamentally bourgeois in nature. This is true of the basic policies of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the American Federation of Labor, and other independent unions. Trade unions actually use the capitalists' provision of capital as an excuse, without challenging the capitalists' right to extract profits from industry. Even at the recent annual meeting, the Congress of Industrial Organizations expressed a reactionary concern for providing employers with what it called "reasonable profits." This conservative trade union policy is based on the so-called harmony between the interests of workers and the interests of capitalists, and the application of this policy does not go beyond maintaining the capitalist system. In effect, this subordinates the interests of workers to the interests of capitalists on all major issues. In earlier times, especially before the Roosevelt administration, conservative trade union leaders used to freely talk about the harmony of labor-capital interests. But now, faced with an awakening membership and a developing Communist Party, these leaders carefully slightly conceal their theory of class collaboration, and the particularly stupid remarks by Murray on this issue, quoted above, are, of course, an occasional exception. In general, the labor bureaucrats who control the workers use fake attacks on big business and condemnation of "unfair employers" as a smokescreen to cover up their philosophy of harmony of interests. But because they enthusiastically support "free enterprise" and recognize the capitalists' "fair profits," they immediately relax this attack. Under the guise of defending the current interests of workers, the essence of their pro-capitalist, anti-working-class ideology and policies remains unchanged.

    The conservative trade union leadership, because it is guided by the ideology of harmony of interests, naturally defends, more or less actively, the existence of trade unions, because they are the tools they use to make a living and seize power. Thus, the bureaucracy sharply opposes the Taft-Hartley Act, which threatens the existence of the labor movement. Because its own "bread and butter" are in danger. The conservative trade union leadership also defends, albeit hesitantly, meeting workers' economic demands for wage increases, reduced working hours, lower prices, social insurance, etc., so that workers are not forced to withdraw from the union in disgust and turn to the Communist Party for leadership. However, as the resistance of members in many arduous struggles has proven, conservatives often lack strategy on this issue. However, on all major issues, those that affect the fundamental interests of capitalists or the survival of the capitalist system, labor bureaucrats humbly follow the line of big capital. In contrast, most workers, although they are by no means revolutionary, show no concern for the interests of capitalists. They try their best to put forward their own demands, with only their personal and class welfare in mind. However, workers are often hampered by conservative tendencies in their thinking. For example, one cannot ignore that in factory elections, often 20 percent, and sometimes even 60 percent, of workers vote that "they don't need a union." Therefore, the general situation of the American labor movement today is that, on the one hand, there are impatient members who raise urgent and, in fact, progressive demands, and on the other hand, there are conservative trade union leaders who are full of a sense of responsibility to capitalists and who prevent workers from doing "too much" in their demands and actions.

    The pro-capitalist class collaboration of conservative trade union leaders has become a stumbling block to the labor movement and threatens the American people and the world.

    In the history of the American labor movement, this pro-capitalist class collaboration attitude of the dominant trade union leaders has become a serious stumbling block. This attitude has led the leaders to refuse to establish trade unions in the face of capitalist opposition, they do not fight for the urgent demands of workers, strikes are defeated because of the betrayal of trade unions, efforts to suppress the development of class consciousness among workers are caused, leftists are persecuted and expelled, in a word, the stagnation and weakening of the entire workers' movement is caused. Class cooperation based on the theory of the unity of labor and capital interests of trade union bosses is the traditional burden on the neck of American trade unions; class cooperation is the main source of the erroneous leadership that has harmed organized labor for many years.

    We might have said that this destructive policy on the part of trade union leaders only affected American workers. But today, because domestic and international conditions have changed, the policy based on the harmony of labor-capital interests has become a real threat not only to organized labor in the United States, but also to all the people of our country and the entire world. The disastrous consequences of this policy can be clearly seen when big monopoly capitalists launch a fascist and war movement to dominate the world. Class cooperation has turned the senior leaders of trade unions into docile tools of this hegemonic imperialism. Let us take the notable example of the Marshall Plan. This is a policy of Wall Street imperialists, which they are now trying to use to mobilize the world's reactionaries under American leadership. Senior labor leaders, loyal to this basic policy of American capitalism, have specifically regarded the Marshall Plan as their own policy. As a result, American trade unions, with the exception of the left wing, are now officially supporting a policy that may lead to world fascism and war. Indeed, the likes of Green, Murray, and Reuther even surpass the employers in their support of the anti-communist slander, militarism, and anti-Soviet hysteria of the imperialist Marshall Plan. The policy of big businessmen, who are carrying out this arduous task, has reduced the leaders of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations to the worst scum among those who split trade unions and sabotage strikes in France, Italy, Latin America, and the world. They are being led to pursue this anti-labor policy in order to cram this Wall Street imperialist policy down the throats of workers in various countries who are unwilling to swallow it. This is why senior American labor leaders are diligently trying to undermine the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Latin American Labor Federation, using the theory of class cooperation to carry out the tasks of their masters.

    This capitalist policy is, of course, a disaster for labor and all the people. American organized workers are in urgent need of a truly working-class policy, a policy based entirely on the current and long-term interests of workers and the country. Naturally, for this policy to be effective, it must be a policy based on Marxist-Leninist principles. This kind of policy change is the most fundamental improvement. It is necessary to make the American workers' movement mature, so that it and its allies can stop the policies of American monopoly capital that promote fascism and create war. The near future will bring all this.

            The fifth weakness of organized labor is the corruption of the leadership.

    The fifth weakness of American labor (which has already been mentioned briefly above) is the corruption of the leadership, which has harmed organized labor since the American Federation of Labor was established about sixty-eight years ago. This bureaucratized leadership has become a major burden on organized labor throughout this long period of sixty-eight years. For a full fifty years, the trade unions in this country have been controlled by the Gompersites. Trade union leaders in other countries are deeply amazed at the anti-working-class leadership components and policies of this incredible reactionary bureaucracy. Most of the Gompersite union leaders were open criminals, robbers, and swindlers. They freely sold out strikes, sold "strike insurance" to bosses, used financial embezzlement, directly plundered workers' money, and misappropriated union funds. Many of them did not keep union expense bills. Some were open spies—they were in high positions because of employer support. They used violence and pure terror to suppress democracy and rule the trade unions. Gun battles often broke out among them to fight for control of the trade unions. All these reactionaries are open defenders of capitalism, and they are political tools of the bosses' parties. Many people have become wealthy and real capitalists. They are the sworn enemies of all true trade union leaders and leftists. The damage caused by this shameless reaction to the struggling young labor movement is incalculable. One of the most beautiful chapters in the history of the Communist Party is the Communist Party's firm opposition to this bureaucracy, despite the industrialists' expulsion, beatings, layoffs, and other threats.

    The main policies of the Gompersite bureaucrats were taken from the armory of the National Civic Federation and other employer groups. For example, in 1920, the senior leaders of the American Federation of Labor were enthusiastic supporters of the employers' "speed-up" policy, which greatly helped to accelerate the economic crisis of 1929. As late as 1930, they vehemently opposed unemployment insurance, and they shouted along with the employers and capitalist politicians: This insurance is an insult to workers, will destroy the trade unions, will subvert our government, and will eliminate the "American way of life." Only when organized labor encountered the obvious disaster of the economic crisis (which created a hungry army of unemployed) did these apelike leaders have to take extremely small steps forward. Their view of the future of workers was, and still is, to keep workers in the slavery of the ruling capitalists, in the position of slaves who are somewhat better fed.

    Since Roosevelt took office in 1933, the looting of this group of old labor swindlers has been greatly reduced. This is largely because millions of unskilled and semi-skilled workers joined the American Federation of Labor's craft unions, giving these unions a more democratic element. Another factor that caused this change was the rise of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, which gave the entire labor movement a progressive and democratizing influence. However, the American Federation of Labor is still in the hands of the remnants of the Gompersites. The American Federation of Labor, on a national scale, its annual meeting is almost entirely composed of well-paid senior executives, and there is not a shadow of democracy in their activities. The practice of well-paid salaries still poisons the labor movement, and we can see everywhere bureaucrats like Joseph Ryan (President of the International Longshoremen's Union, who made himself president for life). All conservative trade unions, including certain unions affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, are controlled by electioneering machines, which are organized to seize and occupy the lucrative jobs of the trade unions. I truly feel concerned every time I hear these autocratic bureaucrats spout nonsense about trade union democracy, and when they dare to criticize truly democratic, left-wing-led trade unions in this country and other countries.

    Conservative trade union leaders have revealed that they have formed a united front with Wall Street and that they are labor imperialists.

    In the current post-war period, the decisive issue of the leadership of trade unions has become increasingly worse. This is because big business is using all its strength in its movement to conquer the world, especially the conservative trade union leaders, to serve imperialism. These trade union leaders—as Daniel De Leon correctly called bourgeois labor assistants fifty years ago—are responding to the imperialist call of their true masters, Wall Street Big Business. In their support of the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, and the entire line of the foreign policy of American imperialism, they are revealing that they have formed a united front with Wall Street. They are labor imperialists. They have the same imperialist ideas as capitalists, and they expect to share the spoils of imperialism in their special way of serving as labor officials—which they hope that the dominant imperialist country will acquire. As I have already pointed out earlier, conservative labor leaders are often even better than the capitalists themselves in their aggressive, war-mongering clamor and their morbid hatred of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party.

    Naturally, such a concentration of power to support Wall Street can only be expected in a situation where labor leaders ardently believe in capitalism. When they are as afraid as they are now that their beloved capitalist system is in danger, or when they realize that their capitalist masters desperately need their support as they do now, they concentrate their power to support American imperialism, throwing the interests of the workers to the winds. These labor leaders take ridiculously high salaries from the workers, and the workers therefore call them workers' representatives. Who can doubt that, when the time comes, many of these so-called labor leaders will not only follow big business into the war, but will even walk into fascism, as their comrades practiced in Hitler's Germany.

    In the Congress of Industrial Organizations, mobilizing senior union executives around the banner of Wall Street imperialism is having a disastrous impact on the progressiveness of the union's former policies. The Murray group of leaders, who had previously followed a moderately progressive line on workers' current demands, have now felt that they should violently split with the left wing on the basic issue of Wall Street's foreign policy. As a result, they have jumped into the camp of the far-right union supporters of American imperialism. When people realize that it was this centrist-leftist alliance that established the Congress of Industrial Organizations and eventually made it a progressive movement, the significance of this breakup of the centrist and the left can be estimated. In the steel, auto, and other trade unions, Murray and other "progressive" leaders had worked freely with dozens of communist organizers in establishing unions, but it should be said in passing that most of the arduous work was done by communists. But now, Murray, in his eagerness to support the currently troubled American imperialism, has deliberately destroyed this healthy centrist-leftist alliance. He and his right-wing friends are trying to cover up this blow to labor with a frenzied movement of anti-communist slander and union-busting atrocities against the more left-leaning unions. Any student who is not very familiar with the history of the labor movement knows that, by carrying out this divisive work, Murray has stabbed a knife in the heart of the progressive process of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. As a result, even as I am writing this, the Congress of Industrial Organizations is rapidly turning to the right in its general policy. Indeed, in some respects, such as in strictly controlling its local unions and plotting to ban the political rights of its member unions, the Congress of Industrial Organizations has become even more reactionary than the American Federation of Labor has been in the past. In the frenzy of relentless anti-communist slander, no American Federation of Labor has ever exceeded the Congress of Industrial Organizations' annual meeting in November 1948. One of the most harmful consequences of Murray's hasty turn to the right, throwing himself into the welcoming arms of American imperialism, is that he has greatly strengthened the leadership of the Social Democrats—Reuther, Leif, Green, etc.—in the Congress of Industrial Organizations. These people (who have their Dubinsky-like companions in the American Federation of Labor) are a particularly harmful threat to the progress of the American labor movement. As the capitalism of the entire world becomes increasingly mired in crisis, they will rely more on these right-wing Social Democrats to resist the offensive of the working class. When this old-fashioned Green, Wool, Hutcheson, Murray, Ryan company come out to sell out the interests of workers, they are still some novices in class collaboration and reactionary spirit, compared with the right-wing Social Democrats.

    Murray, by abandoning progressive policies, may have transferred the leadership of the Congress of Industrial Organizations to the Social Democrat Reuther. If a final vote is taken, it is even now doubtful whether Murray can mobilize the majority of the Congress of Industrial Organizations' annual meeting to support him in the fight against the future autocrats of the trade unions. Reuther is a man of unlimited ambition and arrogance, and he undoubtedly sees Murray's lucrative job as just another rung on his way up. The cunning Reuther will carefully choose the time for his decisive break with Murray. In strengthening Reuther's power, Murray has again done something detrimental to the working class.

    The thorough improvement of the quality of American trade unions is an issue of international importance.

    American organized workers are now suffering from a serious crisis of leadership. This is one of the most serious manifestations of its immaturity. The people who now occupy the leadership of the American Federation of Labor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and the independent trade unions are quite unable to understand the complex problems of the workers in today's complex and difficult economic and political struggles against the powerful American imperialism, or to defend the interests of the workers. Their current pro-imperialist policies in this tense world situation show their incompetence and their fundamental disloyalty to the workers. Their bourgeois consciousness inevitably leads them to fundamentally pursue capitalist policies in all serious situations, precisely when the working class and the country need shrewd, resolute, and patriotic proletarian leadership. When the next economic crisis hits the country, and the class struggle is greatly sharpened, they will show their inability to lead the workers, even worse than they did during the great crisis of 1929.

    The issue of the thorough improvement of the quality of American trade unions is an issue that is not only of great importance to our country's workers and people, but also of serious international importance. Let me repeat that, given the major international role of American imperialism, the betrayal of American labor leaders today has inevitably become a most serious danger to the workers and people of the world. If American imperialism, in its movement to compete for world domination, were forced to cope with the resistance of our country's 15 million trade union members, instead of being supported by most trade union leaders as it is now, then world peace and the cause of democracy would be in a better situation.

    But time, experience, and the sharpening of the class struggle will remedy all this. Everything in the world situation is conducive to stronger, more combative, more political, more socialist-minded, and more left-leaning trade unions. This new trend can be seen in many countries in the world, in which the leadership of the trade unions has been transferred to the communists, their left-wing socialists, and progressive allies. American organized workers, like American capitalism, are not "exceptional," and as it matures, it will take a steady leftward path at an accelerated pace. The current left-wing and progressive trade unions, although still relatively weak in number and size, are the true core of the American labor movement. And the future will prove them right. Despite the fierce attacks they are now suffering from the combined forces of the dominant trade union bureaucracy, Wall Street, and the reactionary Truman government, their strength will be greatly enhanced. We hope that workers will produce this improvement in the face of the current reactionary labor misleaders, those erroneous leaders who follow Wall Street's self-proclaimed world conquerors, letting the world fall into the abyss of a new and more terrible fascism and war.

    美国劳工向前进
    美共主席  福斯特
    编者按：这是美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特同志近著《世界资本主义的末日》一书中的第五章。这本书于一九四九年六月底出版。全书共计十二章，约十三万余言。
    现代美国职工会运动，发轫于内战以后日益发展起来的大工业的扩张和劳工斗争，并在我出生的那一年在全国规模上组织起来了，一八八一年十一月十五日，美国劳工联合会便已在匹茨堡成立。我整个的一生中，事实上是从十四岁起，就与美国职工会运动发生深厚的、密切的关系。在某一时期，从一九一七年到一九二○年，我是美国劳工联合会屠宰包装业和钢铁工业的组织主任。我们组织了二十万屠宰包装工人和三十六万七千钢铁工人，这是美国劳工运动在其中组织工人的第一批现代的、托辣斯化的大生产工业。
    在罗斯福政府时代，特别是在一九三○年到四○年，职工会普遍组织了基本工业中的工人，因而向前迈了一大步，由于工人没有组织起来，基本工业曾经有一个很长时期成为资本家对付劳工的一柄利剑。大的托辣斯化工业中，多年没有强大的职工会，曾给资本家以巨大便利。大资本家能够给这些没有组织起来的工业中的数百万工人，规定他们认为适当的工资，从而使整个工人阶级的工资标准遭受消极的影响。雇主也能够阻止整个劳工运动的有机发展，和妨碍它的政治活动。虽然这些基本工业中的工人已经组织起来了，但因职工会一般地被保守的领袖所操纵，垄断资本家决未完全丧失他们对于工人的控制权。这些高级领袖中，有许多人是很容易受资本家的诱惑和压力的。不过，基本工业中的工人有了组织，使工人阶级掌握了一个很有力的武器，工人阶级在一切适当时机将学会如何有效地运用这个武器的。美国劳工运动现在具有巨大的潜力。
    美近年来两大联系着的民主运动：职工会极大发展与黑人在政治上的活跃
    职工会的巨大发展的结果，已经使工人获得无数重要胜利。劳动条件已经有了改善，基本安全条件已经建立了，初步的社会保险制度开始实施了，而且年资规章也已制订了。但是，工人在上一世代所争得的最重要的成果（次于建立职工会本身的成果）是工作日与工作周的缩短。今天，每日工作八小时，每周工作五日的制度已经变成普遍的了，这比起我当产业工人时的情况有了巨大改进。例如，当三十多年前，我在铁路上做工（我足足在铁路上做了十年工）时，我们每天工作十二小时，而且一个月中没有一天休息。在一九一九年到一九二○年的钢铁大罢工中，三十六万七千罢工工人的主要要求（除了承认他们组织工会权利外）便是废除每日工作十二小时和每周工作七天的制度，而这种制度那时是在整个钢铁工业中普遍实行的。自然，一切这些成果不断地遭受在资本主义社会中活跃着的反动经济与政治势力的危害。
    最近数年另一重大的民主运动（它是和职工会的极大发展密切相联的），是黑人在政治上的跃进。这是整个美国政治情势中的最引人注意的各个方面之一。最近才从实际奴役中解放出来的黑人大众在政治上与文化上的特殊高涨，表现在各个方面。与进步的白人合作的黑人，正在许多领域中起着日益增大的有效作用。他们已经成为职工会运动（首先在基本工业中）的一个真正的因素。他们中间也产生了我国一些最卓越的科学家：他们在我国文化（尤以音乐与戏剧方面显著）的行列中，位列前茅；他们是运动方面的能手，而且他们正在摧毁全国各地（特别是封建主义的南部）的歧视黑人制度。黑人的这些进展（这是勇敢地和机敏地争取得来的）已经使他们成为美国全体人民中最进步的各阶层中的领袖。可是，他们所遭受的歧视却仍然特别厉害。因为工业中心城市的黑人地位极其卑贱，这种政治觉醒对有组织的劳工便具有极大重要性。
    劳工运动，自从它发轫以来，就必须在世界上前所未有的最强大的资产阶级的抗拒下，求得发展。在这种长期的艰苦斗争过程中，劳工运动已经给了工人以很多保护，但是，它在这方面决未达到完全成熟的地步。它的保守的领导机构，远未充分利用职工会的强大的潜力，在经济的意义上，这个运动是比较强大的，但在思想、组织和政治各基本方面，它却仍然没有发展。它在领导方面也很弱。因此，广泛的劳工运动和以工人为基础的民主联盟，还不能对资本家进行有决定性的挑战，而资本家依然是我国具有坚固防御的政治阶级。有组织的美国工人阶级，迄今尚未达成它成为国家领导者的历史使命，而且，也没有把这一广泛的目标规定为它努力的目的。
            职工会在保守的领导机构下，基本缺点是思想不成熟
    职工会首要的和最基本的缺点，便是思想不成熟。我国的工人大部分还没有断绝与资本主义的精神上的联系。他们没有社会主义的具体远景，而且他们没有阶级自觉。虽然他们具有强大的阶级本性，和优良的无产阶级战斗精神，可是，他们没有在他们自己和资产阶级间画出明确的思想界线。这种思想上的落后性是职工会的严重障碍，职工会在它们的正式纲领和领导中反映并明显地表现出工人在思想方面的完全糊涂。这是一个深深地危害职工会在一切方面进行斗争的弱点。
    美国男女工人的这种思想不成熟的基本原因，是由于美国资本主义制度的力量，比任何其他国家相对地强大。美国工人阶级中的大部分，特别是更加熟练的工人，很久以来便分享“繁荣”之利，这种“繁荣”是伴随我国在发展中的资本主义而俱来的，而且，这种“繁荣”正如我们在上述各章中所已看到的，大部分是在上一世代从战争和修复战争破坏的基础上产生的。工人的工资在一个长时期中几乎比世界任何其他国家都高。许多工人并享有特殊机会，变成在经济上比工人阶级优裕的阶层。例如，在目前，我国的许多工人无疑地正分享着美国资本主义的“良辰美景”，而这是以其他各国人民在第二次世界大战中的战争灾难为基础的。除了这些事实以外，还可能有下列其他各种阻碍美国工人的思想成熟的事实：在我国有从许多国家大量移居美国的工人，而且，他们具有不同的政治、宗教及社会背景。因此，美国工人中的阶级觉悟进步缓慢，不了解社会主义的迫切必要性，是不足为奇的。工人中的大多数人不是从马克思主义的书籍或宣传，而是从他们的日常生活情形中学习事理的。
    资产阶级所谓美国没有阶级和阶级斗争的说法，自然是愚昧无聊的。在这里，正如在其他各资本主义国家一样，是有界限分明的社会阶级的，而且他们之间还为着分配劳动者的产品和争夺政治控制权进行着不断的斗争。在这个国家中，我们有一个强大的，明显地标志出来的资产阶级，他们是世界上最富有、最强大和最傲慢的。我们也有一个广大的、种类繁多的中产阶级。同样也有农民阶级，而且他们中有贫穷和富有的各种阶层。最后，我们有伟大的工人（男的女的）阶级，他们终生在工业中劳动，他们出身于工人家庭，而且完全预料得到至死也还是工人。这些阶级中的每一个阶级都有它自己的明确的政治见解，而且它们之间经常进行一种或多或少积极的斗争，以改善它们各自的地位。这就是阶级斗争。而且，这正如看见普利茅斯岩就看到美国一样（按普利茅斯岩在美国麻州，相传一六二○年荷兰新教徒避难赴美洲时，首先登陆之处——译者）。
    美国无阶级无阶级斗争之说纯系荒谬无稽，劳工运动的历史就是证据
    劳工运动的存在和它的艰苦罢工的长期历史，便是一种充分的证据，证明这个国家中有阶级和阶级斗争。诚然，有些国家有比美国还要猛烈的阶级斗争。问题是美国工人还没有从他们正在进行的阶级斗争中吸取充分的思想上的意义。工人未能认识他们在资本主义美国的阶级地位，是雇主最大的资产之一。雇主和他们的代言人（其中最重要的是保守的劳工领袖们）充分认识到这一点，便不遗余力、不惜金钱和努力去阻止工人从他们现在的思想上的糊涂观念中解脱出来。在目前企图说服工人相信美国没有阶级和阶级斗争的一个比较更愚蠢的企图，便是美国产业工会联合会主席莫莱的著作。莫莱先生在一九四八年六月的《美国杂志》上写道：
    “事实上，在我们这个国家里没有阶级；这就是很少人信仰马克思的阶级斗争学说的原因。我们都是工人。而且，最后分析起来，农民、工厂工人、商人、自由职业者和小职员底利益，都是相同的。甚至把产业中的工作人员分成‘经理人员’和‘工人’，也证明是有些人为的做作的。正如我们所已经发现了的，经理中有大量工人，而工人中也有很多经理。”
    可是，美国工人决没有无可挽回地依附资本家的幻想。他们在思想上是明确地往前进步的。当美国和世界资本主义更深地陷入困境，以及他们的工作和生活条件遭受威胁时，这个国家的工人正开始了解去改善他们的阶级地位，并认识资本主义制度的基本弱点。在三十年代的经济大危机，以及紧接危机以后的罗斯福时期中，工人对资本主义的信心受到了极大动摇。在一个崩溃了的经济制度中有一千七百万失业者这个事实，便是一个有力的教师。工人已经知道：他们再不能指望资本主义给他们甚至合理地安定的工作了。他们现在已经得到这种信念（其基础建立在罗斯福的凯恩斯计划上）：只有国家干涉工业和采行适当的社会保险制度，他们才能享受甚至是暂时的最低限度的经济安全。
    这种对于资本主义某些基本弱点的明确认识，标志着工人在思想上的一大进步。事实上，这打开了他们走向政治化，走向思想上的发展（这最后必定引起阶级自觉和社会主义的远景）的道路的大门。美国工人正在演变中，这种演变至少在某些方面与他们的英国弟兄所经历过的是相似的。在约摸三十年前，英国雇主惯于大事吹嘘说：他们的工人对社会主义是有免疫性的；马克思主义是一种外国的“主义”，而且决不能在不可挽救的资本主义的土壤上生根。但是，一旦不列颠帝国开始衰落，不能以高额工资买好熟练工人，也不能一般地给工人以安稳的工作时，英国工人使开始更清楚地了解到他们的阶级地位，而且，开始大批地转向社会主义。今天，甚至他们的右翼社会民主党领袖正在出卖他们，但是工人们却真正愿望在英国实行社会主义。实际上，这是美国工人正在采取的一般的道路。当美国资本主义陷入明显的困境时，那么，美国工人就将迅速地具有社会主义的思想。
    美国工人的社会主义世界观的发展，将给劳工运动的成长以极大刺激。它将引起这个国家真正的劳工复兴。而且我们可以确定地假定，这个复兴将一定在日益增大的规模上发生。美国资本主义不是“例外的”，美国工人也不是例外的。虽然有某些特殊的民族特点，他们在美国基本上是同在其他国家中的资本主义和工人一样，受着同一的经济、政治和思想规律的影响。美国资本主义不可避免地正在走向一个终将到临的危机，它将不能从这个危机中恢复过来。在这些事件过程中发展起来的美国工人的最后思想目的，将是一个社会主义的远景，和争取赢得工人阶级对美国人民的领导地位。全国制造家协会的发言人可能取笑这种可怕的（对他们是这样的）预言，但是，他们在适当时机将不得不接受这个他们所深恶痛绝的特殊事变。
            职工运动第二弱点在于劳工的经济的组织的质低和量少
    美国职工会运动的第二个主要弱点——这是由于第一个基本的思想弱点产生出来的——在于劳工的经济的组织的质低和量少。虽然职工会总共有一千五百万会员，却仍然还有比这数目更多的合格的工人没有参加工会。这些没有组织起来的工人，是对于职工会的活动效果的一大障碍。如果他们没有被组织起来，这主要地是由于保守的职工会领导机关的重大疏忽所致。无疑地，要是官僚化的职工会高级干部从他们的转椅上动弹一下，并稍为用点时间来做组织工作，那就会有更多的数以百万计的工人可以吸收到职工会中来。除了这种不必要的数量上的弱点以外，各职工会，特别是属于美国劳工联合会和铁路工人工会的，被分裂成为一八九○年或比这更早时期的那类老朽的行业职工会。这种陈旧的组织方式的被保留，主要是因为一整批薪资优厚的职工会高级干部想要保持他们的对工人无益的职位，行业职工会主义对劳工是一个严重的弱点，特别是在艰苦的罢工的时候，当其他的人正在罢工，由于某些部分的工人继续工作，遂使罢工一再遭受灾难性的失败。最后，有组织的工人被拦腰切断分为两个互争雄长的阵营——美国劳工联合会与产业工会联合会。除了两派互争雄长的工人官僚（主要是美国劳工联合会的领袖们，他们正力图保持他们自己集团的利益，而不顾工人的幸福）进行欺诈之外，这种划分（对工人造成不可计量的危害，是美国劳工联合会的反动领袖所造成的）没有任何继续存在的基础。虽然美国有组织的工人似乎进步迟缓，但他们和其他各国的劳工一样却安稳地向着争取规模广阔的运动、产业的组织方式和建立一个全国总工会的道路前进。
            有组织劳工第三弱点是政治方面没有组成广泛群众性政党
    有组织的劳工的第三个严重缺点在于政治方面。美国工人阶级是资本主义世界中唯一没有把自己组织成一个广泛的群众性政党的重要工人阶级。这个国家的劳工仍然跟着资产阶级的政党走，被两党制度的复杂机构所捉弄。工人阶级的思想不成熟是造成这种情势的基本原因，而直接原因却是反动的职工会领导机关的妨碍态度。如果这些领袖们大胆地进行组织以工人为首的新的人民的政党，无疑地，工人会一开始就大量地支持它，使它成为一个有决定意义的政治力量。但是，这些领袖们拒绝这样作，大都是因为他们的个人利害关系与这两个资产阶级政党有千丝万缕的联系。
    像产业工会联合会的政治行动委员会和美国劳工联合会的劳工政治教育同盟那样的组织，是完全不足以满足工人的政治要求的。它们好像是原子能时代的风车。必须组成一个新党，其中包括工人、农民、黑人、知识分子及其他民主力量。华莱士领导的进步党，是向正确方向走的一步。组织这样一个党的时间已经成熟透了，而且，工人们正不顾他们的反动职工会领袖和资产阶级政客的联合反对，向成立这样一个党前进，虽然步调是非常缓慢的。
    就保持对工人的政治控制权而言，两党制度是资本家心目中的掌上明珠。他们利用一切方法使群众为它所束缚。由于这种两党制度的奸计，他们不断地把所谓“两害相权取其轻”来使工人抉择。他们提出两套反动的候选人来竞选。如果工人反对并拒绝投票选举那提出被认为害处较小的反动分子，那么，他们便被威胁着选举害处较大的候选人，那就是选举更加反动的人上台。这是一个致命的政治陷阱。两党制度的作用就是使工人更深地陷入反动的泥淖中。在最近的全国大选中，在杜鲁门和杜威之间并没有什么真正的抉择，因为工人将很快从杜鲁门背弃他的竞选诺言中了解这一点。就是这种“两害相权取其轻”的政策，一步一步地使得德国社会民主党去支持坏上加坏的反动分子。他们最后终于因投票选举兴登堡而自取灭亡。因为兴登堡立刻委任希特勒做他的国务总理，并拱手把德国送给法西斯主义。工人必须勇敢地离开两党制度的恶毒圈子，离开“两害相权取其轻”的政策，而建立他们自己的独立的联合政党。不然，由于垄断资本家控制着两大政党，由于这些大资本家一步步地走向法西斯主义，“两害相权取其轻”的政策和两党制度，就只能使美国工人阶级招致接二连三的失败。美国劳工的成年将以它自己政党的建立为标志。这将是对劳工运动具有极大重要性的步骤。美国劳工只有建立了这样一个独立的政党，才能对傲然的托辣斯进行真正的反抗，才能有效地保卫工人的利益，才能履行那正日益增大地放在它身上的全国领导的责任。
    有组织劳工第四弱点是缺乏真正工人阶级的经济与政治政策
    有组织的劳工的第四个主要弱点，它的不成熟的另一象征，就是它缺乏真正地工人阶级的经济与政治政策。今天职工会的正式政策，尽管它为工人要求改革，但是，它的性质基本上是资产阶级性的。产业工会联合会，美国劳工联合会和其他独立工会的基本政策，都是如此。职工会竟以资本家供给资本为借口，而不向资本家从工业中榨取利润的权利挑战。甚至在最近的年会上，产业工会联合会还对给雇主提供它所谓的“合理的利润”一事，表示反动的关怀。而这种保守的职工会政策又是以所谓工人的利益与资本家的利益一致为基础的，而且，这个政策的运用是不超出保持资本主义制度的范围的。实际上，这使得在一切主要问题上工人的利益从属于资本家的利益。在更早的时候，特别是在罗斯福政府以前，保守的职工会领袖们惯于自由自在地大谈其劳资利益的一致。但是，现在，面对一个正在觉醒的会员和正在发展的共产党，这些领袖们便小心地略为掩蔽他们的阶级合作理论，而像上面所引的莫莱关于这一问题的特别愚笨的言论，自然是偶然的例外。一般地说，控制着工人的劳工官僚是用对大实业家的假象攻击和对“不公平的雇主”的谴责为烟幕，来掩盖他们的利益一致哲学。但是，由于他们热诚支持“自由企业”和承认资本家的“公平利润”，他们立刻松弛了这种攻击。在他们所谓的保卫工人当前利益的外貌下，他们亲资本家、反工人阶级的思想和政策的实质，依然没有改变。
    保守的职工会领导机关，由于它是以利益一致思想为指针的，自然或多或少积极地保卫职工会的存在，因为它们是它用以维持生计和夺取权力的工具。因而，官僚机构尖锐地反对那威胁劳工运动存在的塔夫脱——哈特莱法。因它自己的“面包与牛油”处于危险中。保守的职工会领导机构也保卫，虽然是迟疑不决地，满足工人关于增加工资，减少工时，减低物价，社会保险等经济要求，这样使得工人不致被迫厌恶地退出工会，而转向共产党寻求领导。可是，正如许多艰苦斗争的会员的反抗所证明的，保守分子常常在这个问题上没有战略。然而，在一切主要问题，那些影响资本家基本利益或资本主义制度的生存的问题上，劳工官僚卑躬屈节地奉行大资本家的路线。与此相反，大部分工人，虽然他们决不是革命的，却对资本家的利益毫不表示关怀。他们极力提出他们自己的要求，心目中只有他们个人的和阶级的福利。不过，工人常常被他们思想中的保守倾向所妨碍。例如，人们不能忽视：在工厂选举中，常有百分之二十，有时甚至百分之六十的工人投票说：“他们不需要工会”。因此，今天美国劳工运动的一般情况是，一方面是提出急切，而且实际上是进步的要求的急躁的会员们，另一方面是充满对资本家的责任感和防止工人在要求和行动中做得“过分”的保守的职工会领袖们。
    保守的职工会领袖亲资本家的阶级合作已成劳工运动绊脚石并威胁着美国人民与全世界
    在美国劳工运动史中，占统治地位的职工会领袖的这种亲资本家的阶级合作态度，已成严重的绊脚石。这种态度已经使领袖在资本家的反对面前，拒绝建立职工会，他们不为工人的急迫要求而斗争，使罢工因行业职工会的出卖而失败，引起企图取缔工人发展阶级自觉的努力，引起迫害和开除左翼分子，一言以蔽之，引起整个工人运动的停滞和削弱。以职工会头子的劳资利益一致理论为基础的阶级合作，是美国职工会的颈项上的传统重担；阶级合作是多年来危害有组织劳工的错误领导的主要根源。
    我们曾经可以说，职工会领袖方面的这种破坏性的政策仅仅影响到美国工人。但是，今天由于国内和国际情况已有改变，以劳资利益一致为基础的政策，已经成为不仅是对美国有组织的劳工，而且是对我国全体人民和整个世界的真正威胁了。当大垄断资本家发动一个法西斯与战争运动，以统治世界的时候，这种政策的灾难性结果便可清楚地看出来了。阶级合作把职工会的高级领袖们变为这种跋扈的帝国主义的驯服工具。让我们拿马歇尔计划这个显著的例子来说吧。这是华尔街帝国主义者的政策，这是他们现正企图用以动员在美国领导下的世界反动派的主要工具。效忠于美国资本主义的这个基本政策的高级工人领袖们，已经特地把马歇尔计划认为是他们自己的政策，结果，美国职工会除了左翼以外，现在已经正式地支持着一个可能招致世界法西斯主义和战争的政策了。诚然，格林、莫莱和路特之流甚至在支持帝国主义的马歇尔计划的反共诬蔑，军国主义和反苏的歇斯底里方面，胜过雇主们。实行这一艰巨任务的大商业家的政策，已经使美国劳工联合会和产业工会联合会的领袖们沦为在法国、意大利、拉丁美洲和全世界进行分裂职工会和破坏罢工的人们中间最坏的败类。他们被引导去推行这种反劳工政策，借以把这个华尔街的帝国主义政策塞进不愿吞咽的各国工人的喉头。这就是美国高级劳工领袖利用阶级合作论正在执行主子的任务，辛勤地力图破坏世界工会联合会和拉丁美洲劳工联合会的原因。
    这种资本家的政策，自然对于劳工和全体人民都是一种灾难。美国有组织的工人急切地需有一个真正工人阶级的政策，一个完全建立在工人和国家的当前利益和长远利益之上的政策。自然，要这个政策行之有效，必须是以马列主义原则为基础的政策。这样一种政策的改变，是一种最基本的改进，它是使美国工人运动趋于成熟，使它和它的同盟者能够制止美国垄断资本的助长法西斯和制造战争的政策所必需的。不远的未来将带来这一切的。
            有组织劳工第五弱点是领导机构的窳败
    美国劳工的第五个弱点（这是在上面已经约略谈到过的）是领导机构的窳败，这是有组织的劳工自从约六十八年前美国劳工联合会成立以来就已遭到它的危害的。这种官僚化的领导，在这六十八年的整个漫长时期中，已成为有组织的劳工的重大负担。整整五十年来，这个国家的职工会就被龚柏斯派所操纵。其他国家的职工会领袖们，对于这种不可置信的反动官僚机构的反工人阶级的领导成分和政策，都深表惊异。职工会领袖中的大部分龚柏斯派，都是公开的凶犯，强盗和骗子。他们自由自在地出卖罢工，向老板兜售“罢工保险证”，利用财政上的营私舞弊，直接掠夺工人的钱财，和骗用职工会的经费。他们之中有许多人不作职工会开支账单。某些则是公开的奸细——他们是因雇主支持而窃据高位的。他们用暴力和纯粹的恐怖来镇压民主，统治职工会。他们之间常常不断发生用枪战来争夺职工会控制权的事情。一切这些反动分子，都是资本主义的公开维护者，而且他们是老板的政党的政治工具。许多人变成了富有的真正的资本家。他们是一切真正的职工会领袖和左翼分子的宿敌。这种无耻的反动派对苦斗中的年青的劳工运动所造成的危害，是无法计算的。共产党人历史上最优美的篇章之一，便是共产党人不顾工业家的开除、殴打、解雇、和其他威吓，坚决反对这种官僚机构。
    龚柏斯派官僚的主要政策，是从全国市民联合会和其他雇主集团的武库中取出来的。例如，在一九二○年时，美国劳工联合会的高级领袖是雇主的“赶快”政策的热诚支持者，这个政策大大有助于加速一九二九年的经济危机。迟至一九三○年，他们还猛烈反对失业保险，他们跟着雇主和资本家的政客一起叫嚣：这种保险是对工人的侮辱，将摧毁职工会，会要颠覆我国政府，并将消灭“美国的生活方式”。只有当有组织的劳工遭遇了经济危机（它造成了饥饿的失业大军）的明显灾难时，这些人猿似的领袖才不得不往前采取极微小的步骤。他们对工人的前途的看法过去是，现在还是使工人处于在统治的资本家奴役下，多少吃得好一点的奴隶地位。
    自从一九三三年罗斯福执政以来，这一批旧的劳工骗子的掠夺，已被大大缩小。这大部分是因为数百万不熟练的和半熟练的工人参加了美国劳工联合会行业工会，给这些工会以比较民主的成分。引起这种改变的另一因素，是产业工会联合会的兴起，该工会给整个劳工运动以进步的、民主化的影响。可是，美国劳工联合会仍然掌握在残余的龚柏斯分子手中。美国劳工联合会，就全国范围来说，它的年会几乎完全是薪资优厚的高级干部组成的，他们的活动中，没有一点民主的影子。薪资优厚这个积习还在毒害劳工运动，而且，我们随处可以看见像约瑟夫·黎安（国际码头工人工会主席、他使他自己终身当选主席）这样官僚分子。一切保守的职工会，包括产业工会联合会所属某些工会在内，是为贿选的机器所操纵的，而这个机器是组织来夺取和霸占职工会的肥缺的。我每每听到这种专制的官僚分子信口雌黄说什么职工会的民主，和他们竟敢批评本国及他国真正民主的、左翼领导的职工会时，真正感觉关心。
    保守的职工会领袖揭示了：他们已与华尔街结成统一战线，他们是劳工帝国主义者
    在目前战后时期，在职工会领导机构这个有决定意义的问题上，已经变得江河日下。这是因为大实业家在征服世界的运动中，正在动用它的全部力量，特别是保守的职工会领袖，去为帝国主义服务。这些职工会领袖们——正如丹尼尔·戴·莱翁在五十年前所正确地称呼的资产阶级的劳工助手——正在响应他们真正主子——华尔街大实业家的呼声中的帝国主义的号召。在他们支持杜鲁门主义，马歇尔计划，北大西洋公约和美国帝国主义的外交政策的整个路线中，他们正揭示了：他们已与华尔街结成统一阵线。他们是劳工帝国主义者。他们具有与资本家相同的帝国主义者的观念，而且他们期望用他们那充当劳工官员的特殊方式分享帝国主义的掠夺品——这是他们希望占统治地位的帝国主义国家将要获取到手的。正如我早先已经指出的，保守的劳工领袖们常常在他们的侵略主义的，贩卖战争的喧嚣和对苏联及共产党的病态仇恨中，甚至比资本家自己还胜一筹。
    自然，只有在劳工领袖热烈相信资本主义的情况中；才能期望这样把力量集结起来，支持华尔街。当他们像现在一样生怕他们心爱的资本主义制度处于危险中；或当他们了解到他们的资本家主子像现在这样急需他们的支持时，他们就集结力量以支持美国帝国主义，而把工人的利益，抛到九霄云外了。这些劳工领袖从工人那里支取荒谬的高额薪金，而且工人因此叫他们做工人的代表。谁能怀疑：只要时机一到，很多这种所谓的劳工领袖，就会不但跟着大实业家走进战争，而且甚至会像他们的同伴在希特勒德国所实行的那样走进法西斯主义。
    在产业工会联合会中，把职工会高级干部动员到华尔街帝国主义的旗帜周围，正对该工会从前政策的进步性起着灾难性的影响。领袖们中的莫莱集团，他们从前在工人当前要求上曾经遵行着一个温和的进步方针，现在已经认为应该在华尔街外交政策这个基本问题上与左翼猛烈地分裂了。结果，他们已经跳进了美国帝国主义极右翼的工会支持者的阵营中。当人们认识到：建立产业工会联合会和使它最后成为进步运动的正是这种中派——左派联合的时候，这次中派和左派的破裂的意义，就可能估计得到了。在钢铁，汽车和其他职工会中，莫莱和其他“进步”领袖们在建立工会中，曾与数十位共产党组织家无拘束地一同工作，但要顺便说的是，大部分艰苦的工作都是共产党人做的。但是，现在莫莱由于急于支持目前处在困境中的美国帝国主义，已经故意摧毁这一健康的中派——左派同盟。他和他的右翼朋友们正在企图用对比较左倾的职工会的反共诬蔑和破坏工会的暴行的疯狂运动，来掩盖这种对劳工的打击。不需要很熟劳工运动史的学生都可知道：由于进行这种分裂工作，莫莱已经在产业工会联合会的进步过程中心插下一把刀，结果，甚至在我执笔时，产业工会联合会在它的总的政策上，正在迅速地向右转。真的，在某些方面，例如在严厉统制它的地方工会和预谋禁止它的会员工会的政治权利上，产业工会联合会已经比美国劳工联合会过去所为更加反动了。在疯狂无情的反共诬蔑中，任何一次美国劳工联合会都没有超过一九四八年十一月的产业工会联合会年会。莫莱仓卒倒向右派，投入美国帝国主义表示欢迎的双臂中的最有害的结果之一，便是他因此而大大加强了社会民主党人——路特·莱夫，格林等在产业工会联合会中的领导权。这些人们（他们在美国劳工联合会中有他们的杜宝斯基之流的友伴）是对于美国劳工运动进展特别有害的威胁。当全世界的资本主义愈益深陷危机时，他们就更要依靠这种右翼社会民主党人去抵挡工人阶级的进攻。当这个旧式的格林，乌尔、赫契逊、莫莱、黎安公司出而出卖工人利益时，他们在阶级合作与反动精神方面，与右翼社会民主党人比起来，还是一些新手。
    莫莱由于放弃了进步政策，可能已经把产业工会联合会的领导权转让给社会民主党人路特了。如果进行一个最后表决，莫莱是否能在对付职工会的未来专权者的斗争中，动员产业工会联合会的年会中的大多数来支持他，这甚至现在都是值得怀疑的。路特是个具有无限野心和傲慢性的人，他无疑把莫莱的肥缺看作正是他往上爬的另一个梯级。诡计多端的路特将仔细地选择他与莫莱作决定性破裂的时间。在加强路特的势力方面，莫莱已经又作了一件对工人阶级不利的事了。
    美国职工会质量的彻底改善已是一个具有国际重要性的问题
    美国有组织的工人现在正遭受着领导的严重危机的痛苦。这是它不成熟的最严重的表现之一。现在盘据美国劳工联合会和产业工会联合会和独立职工会的领导机构的人，都是十分不能了解在今天反对强大的美国帝国主义的复杂和艰难的经济与政治斗争中，工人目前的复杂问题或保卫工人的利益的人们。他们在这紧张的世界情势中的目前的亲帝国主义的政策，表明他们的无能和他们对工人根本不忠诚。他们的资产阶级意识引导他们不可避免地在一切严重情势中，正是在工人阶级和国家需要精明的、坚决的和爱国的无产阶级领导的时候，基本上奉行资本家的政策。当下一次经济危机冲击本国，而且使阶级斗争大大地尖锐化时，他们将显出他们没有能力去领导工人，其情况甚至比他们在一九二九年的大危机时所表现的更坏。
    美国职工会质量的彻底改善问题，是一个不仅与我国工人与人民有重大关系的问题，而且也是一个具有严重的国际重要性的问题。让我重复说一遍，鉴于美国帝国主义的重大国际作用，今天美国工人领袖的叛卖已经无可避免地变成一个对全世界工人与人民的最严重的危险了。如果美国帝国主义在他争夺世界统治权的运动中被迫应付我国一千五百万职工会会员的反抗，而不是像它现在这样得到大部分职工会领导人的支持，那么世界和平、民主事业就会处于更好的情况中。
    但是，时间，经验和阶级斗争的尖锐化将使一切这些得到补救。世界情势中的一切事情都有利于更强大，更具战斗性，更富政治性，更富社会主义思想，并有更左倾的领导的职工会。这种新趋势可以在世界上许多国家中看出来，在这些国家中，职工会的领导权已经转入共产党人，他们的左翼社会党人和进步的同盟者手中。美国有组织的工人，像美国资本主义一样，不是“例外的”，而且当它成熟时，它将以加速度采取稳定的左倾道路。现在的左翼分子和进步职工会，虽然在数量和规模上还比较弱小，却是美国劳工运动的真正核心。而且未来将证明他们是正确的。尽管他们现在遭受占统治地位的职工会官僚机构，华尔街和反动的杜鲁门政府的联合势力的猛烈进攻，他们的力量将大为增强。我们希望：工人将当着目前反动的劳工错误领导人面前，产生这种改善，那些错误的领导人尾随华尔街自称的世界征服者之后，让世界陷入新的更可怕的法西斯主义和战争的深渊中。
