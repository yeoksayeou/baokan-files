    Welcoming the High Tide of Economic Construction
    Tangshan City Federation of Trade Unions Established, Setting This Year's Labor Movement Guidelines
    It was decided to launch a new record movement, suggest that factories launch rationalization proposals, strengthen worker education, expand cooperatives, and implement the principle of everyone running the trade union.
    [Special Dispatch from Tangshan by Our Newspaper] The Tangshan City Federation of Trade Unions, representing more than 80,000 workers, was officially established on the 28th of last month. The Tangshan Workers' Congress opened on the 24th of last month, attended by 394 representatives from 17 units, including coal mines, cement, railways, textiles, and postal and telecommunications. The congress summarized the workers' movement in Tangshan over the past year since liberation, adopted the work plan for the labor movement in 1950 and the city trade union's organizational charter, and elected Yan Dakai and 44 others as official members of the city trade union committee, and Su Zhong and 8 others as alternate members. The General Trade Union has 17 directly subordinate trade unions, 63 branch unions, and 112 sub-branches, with 72,870 members, accounting for 88 percent of the city's workers. Trade union organizations have become widespread in various public and private factories and mines, as well as small workshops. Since liberation a year ago, trade unions have played a significant role in the recovery and development of production. Under the general guideline of welcoming the victory of the whole country, welcoming the high tide of economic construction, continuing to overcome difficulties, striving for greater improvement in Tangshan's industry, and fighting to complete the 1950 production plan, the meeting decided: (1) to launch a new record movement and suggest that factories implement a rationalization proposal movement. To this end, it is necessary to gradually reform various unreasonable systems that hinder the development of production. In public factories, the content of the democratic management committee should be enriched. In private enterprises, efforts should be made to allow workers to participate in management and sign collective contracts. (2) Strengthen worker education, improve workers' political and technical levels, and open large-scale cultural and after-work supplementary schools. In 1950, organize 10,000 workers to enroll in schools. (3) Expand worker cooperatives, absorb all workers into the cooperatives, and ensure that workers' wages are not lost. The existing unreasonable wage phenomena in various factories and mines should be appropriately adjusted, and the wage system should be reformed where possible. To ensure worker safety, all safety equipment should be thoroughly inspected, and improvements should be made as soon as possible. (4) Trade union organizations have been largely established. At present, it is urgent to overcome formalism, strengthen trade union leadership, and implement the principle of everyone running the trade union. At the same time, there are still 12 percent of workers who have not yet joined the union. Except for a few who cannot join the union, they should be quickly absorbed into the union. (5) Detailed decisions were also made regarding the learning of young workers and the solution of special issues for female workers.
