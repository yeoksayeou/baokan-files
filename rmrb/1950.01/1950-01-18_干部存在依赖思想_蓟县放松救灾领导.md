    Cadres Exhibit Dependency Mentality
    Jixian Relaxes Disaster Relief Leadership
    [This News Report] The disaster situation in Jixian County, Hebei Province, is severe. County leaders should overcome their dependency mentality, explore more solutions, and strengthen the organization and leadership of production-based self-relief. Around Qingdianwa and Taihewa in Jixian, two hundred *li*, one hundred and forty villages are still surrounded by floodwaters. Last year's severe floods forced some people to flee the famine, and there are still 6,208 households without food; 1,079 households are severely short of food and find it extremely difficult to maintain their lives. If production-based self-relief is not resolved in a timely manner, it may lead to a more serious spring famine. Under such severe circumstances, although the Jixian County government has carried out some disaster relief work, such as the people of Taihewa organizing twenty-two large fishing teams with the support of bank loans (37,000 *jin* of grain), catching five to six hundred *jin* of fish every day to ensure the livelihoods of 626 people; and the eleven villages in Qingdianwa earning enough from fishing to support 10,500 people. The supply and marketing cooperative used 15,900 *jin* of red grain to support 1,500 spinning wheels and 120 looms, solving the livelihood problems of 4,000 people. In addition, the Jixian government launched a "bowl of rice for disaster relief" campaign in non-disaster areas, collecting more than 30,000 *jin* of rice to relieve disaster victims, and resettled some disaster victims in non-disaster areas. However, the leading cadres lack sufficient understanding of the principle of production-based self-relief, have not deeply understood the disaster situation, have not summarized the experience of production-based self-relief, and have not explored more solutions. Therefore, the problem of disaster relief has not been thoroughly and universally resolved. The main cadres of forty villages in the disaster area lack confidence and have mostly fled, leaving the masses without a leadership core. The textile industry, which has always been the most basic in Jixian, has also suffered because the leadership did not plan for the long term, with low profits and large sales. As a result, the wage for spinning one *jin* of yarn is two to three *jin* of grain more expensive than spinning one *jin* of yarn in Sanhe County; the wage for weaving one bolt of cloth (five *chi* long) is ten *jin* of grain more expensive than weaving one bolt of cloth in Sanhe County, resulting in sluggish sales of cloth, stagnation of capital, and restriction of reproduction. Fishing is originally an outlet for disaster victims to survive the famine, but some people say that the floods this year washed away the fish, which also affected the people's confidence in fishing. The leadership did not investigate this situation and did not understand the situation thoroughly. The Beishan area of Jixian has many mineral resources. According to County Chief Chen, "If the higher authorities approve mining, we can sign a contract with the Northeast Industrial Department. We can produce 50,000 tons of manganese ore, and the output of tungsten steel will not be small, which can solve the long-term livelihood of 5,000 people." These can be suggested to the higher authorities for research and implementation, but the county has not grasped this tightly. According to investigation, if the county can actively find ways in terms of possible side occupations, such as weaving mats, weaving clusters, and handcarts, as long as the masses are mobilized, and public and private efforts are combined to operate, determine appropriate wages, improve quality, and reduce costs, it is possible to solve part of the problem.

### 干部存在依赖思想  蓟县放松救灾领导

    干部存在依赖思想
    蓟县放松救灾领导
    【本报讯】河北省蓟县灾区灾情严重，县领导上应克服依赖思想，多想办法，加强生产自救的组织和领导。蓟县青甸洼、太和洼周围二百里，有一百四十个村庄，还处在大水包围中。去年的严重水灾，使有的群众被迫逃荒，现在仍有六千二百零八户没有粮食吃；有一千零七百九十户缺粮甚多，生活极难维持，如不及时解决生产自救，将可能造成更严重的春荒。在这样严重的情况下，蓟县县政府虽也曾进行了若干救灾工作，如太和洼人民在银行贷粮（贷了三万七千斤粮）扶持下，组织了二十二个大网班，每天能打五六百斤鱼，保障了六百二十六人生活。青甸洼十一个村每天治鱼的收入，能维持一万零五百人的生活。供销社用一万五千九百斤红粮，扶植了一千五百辆纺车和一百二十架织布机，解决了四千人的生活问题。另外蓟县政府发动非灾区开展一碗米救灾运动，收米三万多斤，救济灾民，并在非灾区安置了一部分灾民。但在领导干部思想中，对生产自救方针还认识不足，没有深入了解灾情，没有总结生产自救经验，没有多想办法，因之，并没有彻底而普遍地解决灾荒问题。灾区有四十个村的主要干部因此缺乏信心大部逃出，群众失去领导核心。蓟县素来最有基础的纺织业，也因领导上没有从长期打算，薄利广销，结果纺一斤线比三河县纺一斤线的工资贵二斤到三斤粮；织一匹布比三河县（长五尺）织一匹的工资多十斤粮，致使布的销路不畅，资本停滞，限制了再生产。治鱼本是灾民渡荒的出路，但有人说今年水大把鱼冲跑了，群众治鱼信心也受影响，对这种情况领导上没有调查，摸不透底，蓟县北山一带本有很多矿产，据该县陈县长说：“如果上级批准开矿的话，能和东北工业部订立合同，锰石可以出产五万吨，钨钢产量也不会少，能解决五千人的长年生活。”这些很可以建议上级研究举办，但该县亦未抓紧。据查该县如能从可能办到的副业方面积极设法，如织席、织簇子、手推车等副业，只要发动群众，公私合力经营，确定适当工资，提高质量，减低成本，是可以解决一部分问题的。
