    On "The Russian Question"
    By Mao Dun
    In April 1947, approximately five hundred theaters throughout the Soviet Union simultaneously staged a newly written play. The simultaneous staging by five hundred theaters (with five theaters in Moscow alone) was unprecedented in the history of Soviet play productions. This play was "The Russian Question," and its author is K. Simonov, who recently visited New China.
    The film "The Russian Question" currently being shown in this city is adapted from the play. Both versions of "The Russian Question" have received the Stalin Prize.
    "The Russian Question" exposes the criminal conspiracy of American imperialism to attempt to attack the Soviet Union and enslave the people of the world. Centered on this, "The Russian Question" points out the essence of what the American imperialists are wildly touting as the "American way of life." It points out the essence of what the United States calls "freedom of the press," "freedom of publication," and "freedom of speech." Of particular importance, "The Russian Question" further points out that all the conspiracies carried out by the Wall Street warmongers in the name of the American people are a serious violation of the interests of the American people; it points out how the democratic and progressive forces in the United States are fighting for the true interests of the people, and that within the United States, democracy and anti-democracy, instigation of war and defense of peace, are two major camps facing each other. Although the forces of anti-democratic, fascist warmongers are still rampant today, they are destined to decline, and they are making a final, mad, and desperate struggle today, while the democratic and peace-defending progressive forces that have inherited the teachings of Washington and Lincoln, although still at a disadvantage today, are bound to develop and ultimately defeat their enemies.
    "The Russian Question" contains the above-mentioned major political content, but all these political propositions are expressed through the life of the protagonist, Smith; therefore, although the theme of the play is such a serious and major political issue, the story of the play is quite light and full of human interest. The audience is actually attending a political lesson, but does not feel bored at all.
    In addition to retaining all the advantages of the stage play "The Russian Question," the film "The Russian Question," because it is not limited by space, can express things that cannot be expressed on the stage, so for the general audience, it is more powerful and more interesting. The film currently being screened in this city, with its perfect Mandarin dialogue, provides even greater convenience to Chinese audiences.
    Due to their actual experience in struggle, the Chinese people have long known that American imperialism is the enemy of democracy and peace. However, it is still necessary for the Chinese people to further understand the true meaning of what the U.S. imperialism is wildly touting as the "American way of life," "freedom of the press," and "freedom of speech and publication," etc., and it is also necessary to understand how the democratic and progressive forces in the United States are fighting. Therefore, this film has great educational significance in China.

    关于《俄罗斯问题》
    茅盾
    一九四七年四月间，苏联全境约有五百家戏院同时演出一个新编的话剧。五百家戏院同时上演，（仅莫斯科一地即有五家同时上演），这在苏联剧本的演出纪录说来，也是空前的。这部话剧就是《俄罗斯问题》，这话剧的作者就是最近来访问过新中国的Ｋ·西蒙诺夫。
    这几天在本市演出的电影《俄罗斯问题》就是根据话剧改编的。这两部《俄罗斯问题》都得了斯大林奖。
    《俄罗斯问题》揭露美帝国主义的企图进攻苏联、奴役世界人民的罪恶阴谋。以这为中心，《俄罗斯问题》指出了美帝国主义者所狂吹的什么“美国生活方式”的本质是什么？指出了美国的所谓“新闻自由”、“出版自由”、“言论自由”的本质是什么？特别重要的，《俄罗斯问题》更指出了华尔街战争贩子们假借美国人民的名义所进行的一切阴谋活动是严重违反了美国人民的利益的；指出了美国的民主的进步的力量如何在为人民的真正利益作斗争，在美国内部，对峙着民主与反民主，煽动战争与保卫和平，这两大阵营，反民主的法西斯的战争贩子们的力量虽然在今天还是气焰汹汹，然而它命定是要没落的，它今天是在作最后的疯狂而绝望的挣扎，而民主的保卫和平的继承了华盛顿、林肯的遗教的进步力量虽然在今天还居于劣势，然而它必然要发展，而且最后战胜了它的敌人。
    《俄罗斯问题》就包含了上述的这些重大的政治内容，可是所有这一切政治命题却通过了剧中主角斯密司的生活而表现出来；因此，这个剧本的主题虽然是那么严肃而重大的政治问题，而剧本的故事却相当轻松，富于人情味，观众实际上是上了一堂政治课，然而绝不感得枯燥。
    影片《俄罗斯问题》除了保有舞台剧本《俄罗斯问题》的一切好处而外，因为是电影不受空间的限制，更能把舞台上所不能表现的东西表现出来，所以对一般观众而言，它是更有力量，更多些兴趣。现在本市演映的这个片子，配上了很完美的华语对白，更给予中国观众以绝大的便利。
    中国人民由于实际的斗争经验，早知道美帝国主义是民主与和平的敌人，然而中国人民还有必要进一步明了美帝所狂吹的什么“美国生活方式”、“新闻自由”、“言论出版自由”等等的真实意义，也有必要明了美国的民主的进步力量在作如何的斗争，所以，本片在中国演出，是有绝大的教育意义的。
