    [News from this newspaper] Sunan News: In the Songjiang Special District of Sunan Administrative Region, 10,976 peasant activists have been promoted to cadres. About one-fourth of them serve as village heads and deputy village heads and other major village-level cadres, and the rest are members of the village people's government and village peasant associations. Among the new cadres, poor and hired peasants account for 69 percent, rural workers account for 4 percent, middle peasants account for 20 percent, and other components (rural intellectuals, etc.) account for 7 percent. According to inspections in November and December of last year, new cadres generally grasped policies correctly, had a decent work style, were selfless, and demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm for work and a progressive spirit in accepting new things in the autumn grain requisition and other work.

    In the first four months after liberation in Songjiang Special District (June to September of last year), mass movements such as bandit suppression, summer grain requisition, production, and disaster relief were launched. The masses' political consciousness and ideological understanding rapidly improved, and a large number of activists emerged. Through education in various meetings and training classes, their policy level and work ability were improved, laying the foundation for the promotion of cadres. Later, each county successively convened people's representative conferences, and local peasant representatives widely conveyed the resolutions of the people's representative conferences back to their villages, inspiring the masses to recall the facts of the Kuomintang reactionary government and feudal forces squeezing the laboring people in the past. The peasants' class consciousness was raised, and feudal ideas such as "poverty is due to fate" and "landlords support peasants" were initially broken, demanding emancipation. The leaders of each county and district carried out systematic education in conjunction with the peasants' demands. In October, after full deliberation and consultation through the peasants' representative conferences of each township, township-level cadres were elected, and the people's own regime was established, destroying the reactionary Baojia system. The rural face was completely renewed.

    After the new cadres were produced, the leadership focused on carrying out class education, requiring the new cadres to stand firm. At that time, four points were emphasized: First, personal interests must be subordinate to class interests. In work, especially in dealing with personal family or friend-related issues, be selfless. Second, point out that in the peasant movement, reactionary landlords will definitely play tricks such as threats and bribery. New cadres must be vigilant. Third, point out that since the people have taken control of the regime, don't be infected by the bad habits of the old ruling class, and serve the people wholeheartedly. Fourth, emphasize the unity of the broad masses of peasants, pointing out that reactionary landlords will use various old relationships in rural areas (such as clan relations) to sow discord and destroy peasant unity. Therefore, cadres must understand the principle of unity and implement it in their work.

    Facts have proved that after the emergence of a large number of new cadres, the landlord class has used various means to carry out sabotage activities. The first is to slander local cadres, because they know that local cadres are most aware of their details and can expose their sins most effectively. On the other hand, many landlords also attempted to win over and buy off local cadres, trying to get cadres to recognize relatives, using honey traps, bribes, and so on; but these conspiracies repeatedly went bankrupt. According to statistics from 148 major cadres in various townships in Chuansha County, 31 people had been attempted to be bought off by landlords in the past two months. Twenty-two of them refused the landlords' bribes (19 of them also publicly exposed the landlords' conspiracy), but it is undeniable that 9 people accepted the landlords' bribes.

    Therefore, leaders at all levels paid special attention to class education for the new cadres and regularly inspected their work. Most of the new cadres who were active in their work and firm in their position were promptly commended, and the masses supported and loved them even more. A small number of new cadres who were not highly class conscious, were not active in their work, or even accepted bribes from landlords, the leadership will continue to educate and transform them, while exposing the landlords' conspiracies and tricks, to educate the broad masses of peasants and cadres.

    松江专区从实际斗争中提拔万余农民干部
    及时进行阶级教育检查工作
    地主腐蚀新干部阴谋被粉碎
    【本报讯】苏南消息：苏南行政区松江专区已有一万零九百七十六名农民积极分子提拔为干部。其中约有四分之一担任正副乡长等乡级主要干部，其余为乡人民政府委员与乡农民协会委员等。新干部中，贫雇农成份占百分之六十九，农村工人占百分之四，中农占百分之二十，其他成份（农村知识分子等）占百分之七。据去年十一、十二两月份检查，新干部在执行秋季征粮等工作中，一般都能正确地掌握政策，作风正派，大公无私，并表现了高度的工作热情与接受新事物的前进精神。
    松江专区在解放后的最初四个月中（去年六月至九月），发动了剿匪、夏征、生产、救灾等群众运动，群众逐渐政治觉悟与思想认识迅速提高，涌现了大批积极分子。经过各种会议与训练班的教育，提高了他们的政策水平与工作能力，为提拔干部打下了基础。以后各县先后召开了各界人民代表会议，各地农民代表回乡广泛传达了人民代表会决议，激发群众回忆过去国民党反动政府与封建势力压榨劳动人民的事实，农民的阶级觉悟提高，初步打破了“穷是由于天命”，“地主养活农民”等封建思想，要求翻身。各县区领导上结合农民要求进行了系统的教育。十月间，经群众争先充分酝酿协商，通过各乡农民代表会议，选举出乡级干部，建立了人民自己的政权，摧毁了反动的保甲制度。农村面目为之一新。
    新干部产生后，领导上即着重进行阶级教育，要求新干部站稳立场。当时强调提出四点：第一，个人利益必须服从阶级利益，在工作中，特别在处理个人家庭或与亲友有关的问题上，要大公无私。第二，指出在农民运动中，反动地主一定会玩弄威胁、收买等阴谋手段，新干部要提高警惕。第三，指出人民自己掌握了政权，千万不要受旧统治阶级的恶劣作风的传染，要全心全意为人民服务。第四，强调广大农民的团结，指出反动地主会利用农村间各种旧有关系（如宗族关系）来进行挑拨离间，破坏农民团结。因此，干部要懂得团结的道理，并贯彻到工作中去。
    事实证明，大批新干部产生后，地主阶级曾以各种手段来进行破坏活动。首先是污蔑本地干部，因为他们知道本地干部最明了他们的底细、最能揭露他们的罪恶。另一方面，许多地主又企图拉拢收买本地干部，找干部认亲戚，施美人计、贿赂等等；但是这些阴谋一再破产。据川沙县各乡一百四十八个主要干部统计，两个月来被地主企图收买过的有三十一人。其中有二十二人拒绝了地主的收买（内有十九人并公开揭破了地主的阴谋），不可忽视的是有九人受了地主的贿赂。
    因此，各级领导上特别注意了对新干部的阶级教育，并经常检查其工作。对大部分工作积极、立场坚定的新干部，曾及时予以表扬，群众对他们也更加拥护爱戴，另一小部分阶级觉悟不高，工作表现不积极，甚至接受地主收买的新干部，领导上将继续予以教育、改造，同时揭破地主的阴谋诡计，以教育广大农民和干部。
