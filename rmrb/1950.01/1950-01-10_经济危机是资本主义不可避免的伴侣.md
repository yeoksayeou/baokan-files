Economic crisis is an inevitable companion of capitalism.

The future development of capitalist countries after the war has caused increasing anxiety among thinkers and political activists in the bourgeois world. The specter of new economic crises constantly appears in all the writings of bourgeois economists. Some of them have already understood how serious the new crisis and the unemployment associated with it are in terms of potential social and political crisis for the fate of capitalism. For example, the British economist Beveridge pointed out in his book "Full Employment in a Free Society": "It is necessary to reach such a high level of work, which is necessary to prevent revolution."

American economist Ayres wrote in his book "The Divine Right of Capital" that a new crisis could lead social conflicts to such an extent that any compromise would become impossible.

Ayres's solution is to have wealthy monopolists agree to reduce their income and rights.

Currently, bourgeois economists have published a large number of books, attempting to provide various prescriptions for the "health" of capitalism and its "crisis-free" development. In these prescriptions, they talk about "orderly" capitalism, "organized" capitalism, "national" capitalism, "family" capitalism, "static" capitalism, "dynamic" capitalism, "limited" capitalism, and various other kinds of capitalism.

In this way, bourgeois politicians and economists are doing everything possible to spread various illusions among the masses about the possibility of capitalist planning and the possibility of avoiding all the inherent contradictions of the capitalist system.

The theory of "organized capitalism" is one of the "theoretical" sources of capitalist "planned economy." The author of this theory is Hilferding. He insisted that capitalism had entered a new era of "organized capitalism," which in principle replaces the principle of free capitalist competition with the principle of social planned production.

Lenin thoroughly exposed this bourgeois theory in his own works.

In his book "State and Revolution," Lenin vehemently criticized the reformist whitewashing of capitalism, "as if monopoly capitalism or state monopoly capitalism is no longer capitalism, and can be called 'state socialism' and the like." (Selected Works of Lenin, Chinese edition, Volume 2, page 233)

Comrade Stalin—the great creator of the Stalin Five-Year Plan praised by our people (referring to the Soviet people—editor)—repeatedly pointed out that planning is only possible under Soviet realities, that is, only when the means of production are not the property of individual capitalists, but the property of the state, public property, and national property.

Bourgeois sociologists and economists who serve imperialism create absurd and anti-scientific plans for "planned" capitalism. The class essence of these "plans" is to strengthen the rule of the bourgeoisie, deprive the broad masses of working people of the extremely limited right to struggle against capitalists, and nullify the activities of trade unions and other workers' organizations. Hidden under the banner of "planned capitalism" is the intention of a small group of financial oligarchs who regularly and systematically expand armaments to exercise complete control over the national economy.

When the means of production are still private capitalist property, there is no question of capitalist economic planning at all.

As long as private ownership of the means of production exists, the anarchy of production and crisis will still exist. Capitalist activists have tried more than once to "prevent" and "eliminate" crises, but they have all failed. The same can be said of all the current attempts by American and British imperialist thinkers. The reason why they will also fail is because "the basis and cause of the economic crisis of the production process are due to the capitalist economic system itself. The basis of the crisis is also due to the contradiction between the social nature of production and the capitalist form of ownership of the results of production." (Leninist Questions, Russian edition, tenth edition, page 350)

Profit is the factor that drives capitalist activity. In order to obtain huge profits, they expand production, improve technology, and intensify the exploitation of workers, that is, they expand products with one hand and reduce the possibility of product sales with the other. This contradiction often causes the phenomenon of overproduction and sales crisis in the capitalist economic system. When Comrade Stalin talked about the crisis, he pointed out: "The crisis arises with the emergence of capitalism. For more than a hundred years, periodic economic crises have repeated themselves every twelve years, ten years, eight years, and even less than these years." (Leninist Questions, Russian edition, tenth edition, page 350)

Following the crisis from 1921 to 1922, the crisis of overproduction from 1929 to 1933 arrived, followed by the crisis from 1937 to 1939—this crisis was interrupted by World War II. These crises have thoroughly shaken the economic institutions of capitalist countries. Although the economic crisis from 1937 to 1939 was interrupted by the war, this crisis was more serious than any crisis from 1820 to 1914.

As for the destructiveness of economic crises in the imperialist era, it is enough to cite the following figures. During the economic crisis from 1929 to 1933, coal mining in the United Kingdom regressed by twenty-nine years, while the United States regressed by thirty-one years. In terms of iron mining, the United States regressed by seventy-six years, while the United Kingdom regressed by forty-two years. During these years, the number of unemployed people in all capitalist countries reached the huge figure of 40 million.

In the era of the general crisis of capitalism, crises have not been eliminated, but have intensified. Periodic crises of overproduction are deeper, sharper, longer, and more destructive than before. In the past, before the era of imperialism, industrial upswings could still be seen in the intervals between crises in various periods. Today, in the imperialist era, in the short intervals between crises, many of the most important capitalist countries have not seen any significant increase or rise in production. In the oldest and largest capitalist countries, such as Britain and France, industry has remained at its original level for more than thirty years after the First World War. In individual years, small industrial increases can be seen in these countries, but for the most part, industry is in a state of stagnation and depression.

Economic crisis is the inevitable companion of capitalism, which explains what kind of environment the post-war environment is.

The capitalist economy is facing great difficulties. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union has exceeded the pre-war level of 1940 by 50 percent in its development. People's democracies have also far exceeded the pre-war scope.

In his report at the celebration of the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, Comrade Malenkov said: "Comparing the situation of the socialist camp with that of the capitalist camp, we cannot but see the following extremely important factor. When the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies are thriving economically, and their economies are constantly rising, in the United States, the signs of economic crisis are becoming more and more obvious."

Since the autumn of 1948, production in the United States has been declining steadily. In July 1949, production only reached 65 percent of the wartime peak.

From October 1948 to July 1949, steel production fell by 28 percent, machinery fell by 21 percent, non-ferrous metals fell by 32 percent, and textiles fell by 27 percent. In the year from October 1948 to October 1949 alone, the level of industrial production in the United States fell by 22 percent.

Everyone knows that the difficulties of economic crises in capitalist countries first hit the working class, hit the peasants, and all working people. The monopoly bourgeoisie strives to put these difficulties on the shoulders of the working people. With the economic crisis comes increased unemployment, reduced people's purchasing power, increased poverty, and such terrible disasters as famine. Unemployment in the United States is increasing. In one year, the number of unemployed in the United States has doubled. Coupled with the underemployed, the total number is more than 14 million.

The situation in other capitalist countries is even worse. The United States is trying its best to inflict the disasters caused by the crisis on its servants—Britain, France, and Italy—and on the people of the colonies that depend on these countries.

It is with this purpose that the devaluation of the pound sterling was implemented in the United Kingdom, that is, devaluing the pound sterling and making it subordinate to the US dollar.

The US "aid" of the "Marshall Plan," which seems to be US assistance to other countries—Britain, France, Belgium, etc.—is the biggest deception.

The result of this "aid" has caused enormous economic difficulties due to the onslaught of the economic crisis, production cuts, increased unemployment, and rising prices.

What can the monopoly capitalists of the United States, Britain, France, and other capitalist countries give to the people of their countries who yearn for peace, work, bread, and freedom?

Not peace, but frenzied war preparations; not work, but unemployment; not bread, but bullets for hungry striking workers; not freedom, but the rampant terror of suppressing the working class and all progressive forces.

The reactionary groups in these countries are seeking a way out of the growing crisis by means of arms races, launching war hysteria, intensifying the oppression of the working people, and imposing terror and brutal suppression on the masses' dissatisfaction. But this policy contains many dangers. It can and will only achieve the opposite result, namely, the rapid development of the masses' struggle against the oppression of monopoly capital, against war, for peace, for democracy, and for socialism.

The post-war environment clearly reaffirms: "The capitalist economic system is baseless and unstable. It has lived out its days and should give way to another higher, Soviet socialist economic system. The only economic system that is not afraid of crises and can overcome the difficulties that capitalism cannot solve is the Soviet economic system." (Stalin's words)

### 经济危机是资本主义不可避免的伴侣

    经济危机是资本主义不可避免的伴侣
    资本主义各国战后发展的前途在资产阶级世界的思想家和政治活动家中间引起了日益增长的不安。新的经济危机的幽灵不断在资产阶级经济学家的一切著作里面出现。其中某些人已经理解到，新危机和与危机有联带关系的失业现象对资本主义的命运潜在有如何严重的社会——政治危机性。例如，英国经济学家贝维利兹在他所写的《自由社会里面的完全工作》一书内就指出说：“必须达到这样高度的工作水平，这对于防止革命是必要的。”
    美国经济学家艾列斯在《资本的神圣权利》一书中写道，新危机能把社会冲突引到这样的程度，以致任何妥协也将成为不可能。
    艾列斯所认为的出路，就是使富有的垄断资本家同意缩减自己的收入和权利。
    现在，资产阶级经济学家出版了大量书籍，他们企图对资本主义的“健康”及其“没有危机的”发展给以各种处方。他们在这些处方里面谈到“有秩序化”的资本主义、“有组织化”的资本主义、“国民”资本主义、“家庭”资本主义、“静止”资本主义、“动力”资本主义、“有限制的”资本主义及其他各种资本主义等。
    这样一来，资产阶级政客和经济学家们千方百计地力图在群众中间散布各种关于资本主义计划可能性、关于资本主义制度所固有一切矛盾之避免的可能性的错觉。
    “有组织化的资本主义”的理论乃是资本主义“计划经济”的“理论”源泉之一。这种理论的作者就是吉尔费尔丁格。他硬说，资本主义已进入“有组织化的资本主义”新纪元，“有组织化的资本主义”就是在原则上用社会的计划生产原则代替资本主义自由竞争原则。
    列宁在自己著作中曾经把资产阶级的这种理论彻底揭穿。
    列宁在《国家与革命》一书中曾猛烈抨击资本主义的改良主义粉饰“似乎垄断的资本主义或国家垄断的资本主义已经不是资本主义，已经可以称为‘国家社会主义’以及诸如此类等等。”（《列宁文选》两卷集第二卷中文版第二三三页）
    斯大林同志——我国人民（指苏联人民——编者）所称道的斯大林五年计划的伟大创作者——曾屡次指出说，只有在苏维埃现实条件下，也就是说只有当生产工具和生产资料不是个别资本家的财产，而是国家的财产、公有财产、全民财产的时候，计划才成为可能。
    为帝国主义效劳的资产阶级社会学者和经济学者们造出荒谬而反科学的“计划”资本主义的计划。这些“计划”的阶级实质就是加强资产阶级的统治，剥夺广大劳动群众与资本家进行斗争的极有限的权利，并使职工会及其他工人组织的活动化归乌有。在“计划资本主义”的旗帜下面隐藏着那一小撮经常而有统系的扩张军备的财政寡头对全国经济进行全部统治的意图。
    当生产资料仍然是私人资本主义私有制的时候，那是丝毫谈不上资本主义经济计划性的。
    当生产资料私有制仍然存在时，生产的无政府状态和危机也就仍然存在。资本主义活动家虽曾不只一次地试图竭力“预防”和“消除”危机，但是他们都归于失败了。对于美、英帝国主义思想家目前的一切企图也可以这样来说。他们之所以同样要失败，就是因为“生产过程的经济危机的基础及其原因都是由于资本主义经济制度本身所产生。危机的基础也是由于生产的社会性质和生产结果的资本主义占有形式之间的矛盾所产生。”（《列宁主义问题》俄文本第十版三五○页）
    利润是推动资本家活动的因素。他们为要得到大量利润，就扩大生产，改善技术和加紧对劳动者剥削，也就是说，他们用一只手来扩大产品，而用另一只手去缩减产品销售的可能性。这种矛盾就时常使资本主义经济制度发生生产过剩和销售危机的现象。斯大林同志谈到危机时，曾指出说：“危机是与资本主义之产生而产生出来的。在一百多年来的过程中，周期性的经济危机，每经过十二年到十年到八年以及不足这些年月就要重复发生。”（《列宁主义问题》俄文本第十版三五○页）
    随着一九二一年到一九二二年的危机之后，就是一九二九年到一九三三年的生产过剩危机之到来，随后就是一九三七年到一九三九年的危机——这次危机被第二次世界大战所中断。这几次危机都曾彻底动摇了资本主义国家的经济机构。虽然一九三七年到一九三九年的经济危机被战争所中断了，但是这次危机却比一八二○年到一九一四年期间内任何一次危机都更加严重。
    至于帝国主义时代的经济危机具有怎样的破坏性，只要举出下面的数字即已足够说明。在一九二九——一九三三年间的经济危机时期，英国煤的开采量倒退了二十九年，而美国倒退了三十一年。铁的开采方面，美国倒退了七十六年，英国则为四十二年。在这几年中，所有资本主义国家的失业人数达到了四千万这样庞大的数字。
    在资本主义总危机的时代，危机不但没有消除，反而日益加剧。生产过剩的周期性危机，比以前还更加深，更尖锐，更长期和更有破坏性。从前，在帝国主义时代以前，在各个时期危机的间隙时间里，还可以看到工业的上升。今天在帝国主义时期，在各时期危机间的短短的间隙时间里，许多最主要的资本主义国家，都没有怎样显著的生产增加和上涨，像英国、法国这些最老最大的资本主义国家，在第一次大战后的三十多年的时间内，工业都保持在原来的水平上。在个别的年份里，这些国家里可以看到微小的工业上涨，但极大部分的时期，工业都处于停滞和不景气的状态。
    经济危机是资本主义必不可免的伴侣，这说明了战后的环境是一个什么样的环境。
    资本主义的经济正面临着极大的困难。大家知道，苏联在它的发展中已超过战前一九四○年水平的百分之五十。各人民民主国家也已远超过战前的范围。
    马林科夫同志在他庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命三十二周年大会的报告中说到：“将社会主义阵营与资本主义阵营的状况作一比较，我们就不能不看到下述极重要的因素。当苏联和人民民主国家在经济上蒸蒸日上的发展，当它们的经济不断高涨的时候，在美国，经济危机爆发的征候正愈来愈多。”
    自一九四八年秋季以来，美国的生产即在节节下降。在一九四九年七月，生产只达战时最高峰的百分之六十五。
    从一九四八年十月到一九四九年七月，钢铁产量下降百分之二十八，机器下降了百分之二十一，有色金属下降了百分之三十二，纺织品下降了百分之二十七。仅在一九四八年十月到一九四九年十月这一年内，美国的工业生产水平下降了百分之二十二。
    大家知道，资本主义国家里经济危机的困难，首先就打击着工人阶级，打击着农民和一切劳动者。垄断资产阶级努力把这些困难加于劳动者的肩上。随着经济危机而来的是失业增加、人民购买力降低、贫穷现象增涨，以及饥馑流行等这样可怖的灾害。美国的失业正在增加。一年来美国失业人数增加了二倍。再加上半失业者，则总共人数在一千四百万以上。
    其他资本主义国家里的情形还要更坏。美国尽力把危机所造成的灾害加之于自己的仆从——英国、法国、意大利的身上，加之于依赖这些国家的殖民地的人民身上。
    正是抱着这种目的，才在英国实行了英镑贬值，即是说贬低英镑的价值并使之服从于美元。
    “马歇尔计划”的美“援”，这种好像是美国对其他国家——英国、法国、比利时等——的援助，乃是一种最大的骗术。
    这种“援助”的结果，造成了因经济危机的进攻、生产减缩、失业增涨以及物价高涨而起的极大的经济困难。
    美国、英国、法国以及其他资本主义国家的垄断资本家们，对本国渴望和平、工作、面包和自由的人民能够给些什么呢？
    不是和平，而是疯狂的战争准备；不是工作，而是失业；不是面包，而是给饥饿的罢工工人的枪弹；不是自由，而是镇压工人阶级及一切进步力量的恐怖的横行。
    这些国家里的反动集团，正在用军备竞赛、发动战争歇斯底里、加紧压榨劳动人民，对群众的不满施以恐怖和残酷的镇压等方法来从日益增长的危机中找寻出路。但这种政策包藏着许多危险。它能够而且也会得到的只有相反的结果，那就是：群众反对垄断资本的压迫、反对战争、争取和平、争取民主以及争取社会主义的斗争的飞速发展。
    战后的环境极其明显的再度证实了：“资本主义经济体系是没有基础和不稳固的。它已活尽自己的天年而应让位给其他更高的、苏维埃社会主义经济体系。不怕危机并能克服为资本主义所不能解决的困难的唯一经济体系，这就是苏维埃经济体系。”（斯大林语）
