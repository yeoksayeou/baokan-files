    Improving Work and Wage Systems
    Heishan Coal Mine Efficiency Increased

    [Our Dispatch] The Heishan Branch of the Mentougou Coal Mine has improved its work and wage systems, increasing the advance rate of the newly opened No. 1 and No. 2 shafts from 0.78 meters per day to 1.23 meters (thickness 0.78 meters). In order to supply a large amount of coal to Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, and other places, the Jingxi Coal Mine Company requested the plant to advance the shafts by 250 to 280 meters before the rainy season this year, and to complete the coal production task. However, since construction began last July, the daily progress had long stagnated at around 0.78 meters, which would affect the completion of the task. Later, after unified research by the Party, government, labor union, and youth league, it was requested to increase the advance rate to more than one meter. At the beginning, the workers generally lacked confidence and felt unsure. Later, the workers of the No. 2 shaft first proposed to launch a competition, and reached a record of 1.2 meters on the 7th of this month (later increased to 1.3 meters). The various shafts then rose up to catch up, learning from advanced units, and created the current record. The increase in efficiency is primarily due to the workers being mobilized and then improving the work system. For example, in the past, the gap between two shifts was as long as one and a half hours, but now the oncoming shift goes down the well first, so the outgoing shift no longer wastes time; in the past, each shift of the 6:00 AM shift had more than 20 people, and no one was specifically responsible for drilling holes, blasting, carrying dross, unloading dross, etc., except for the foreman, but now group leaders have been selected to be in charge. The blasting team blasts out the stones, and the slag loading team ensures timely transport. The No. 1 shaft learned this method, which also promoted the overall work. In addition, since December of last year, the wage system has also changed from the simple method of issuing 8 jin of rice per day regardless of the quality of work in the past, and adopted the method of calculating wages based on the unit of advance rate, which stimulated the enthusiasm for labor. With the increase in efficiency, the average wage per person has also generally increased to 11 jin, and everyone's morale is even higher. (Note: The current wage system of the mine is still very imperfect, but it is more reasonable than before.)

    改善工作制度与工资制度
    黑山煤矿效率提高
    【本报讯】门头沟煤矿黑山分矿改进工作制度与工资制度，使新开一、二号井的进尺由每天○·七八米提高到一·二三米（厚○·七八米）。为供应京、津、保等地大量用煤，京西煤矿公司曾要求该厂在今年雨季以前开井进尺二五○至二八○米，完成出煤任务。但从去年七月开工，每天进度长期停滞在○·七八米左右，势将影响任务完成。后经党、政、工、团统一研究，要求提高进尺到一米以上。开始时工人一般都缺乏信心，觉得没把握。后经二号井工友首先提议开展竞赛，并于本月七日达到一·二米的纪录（后又增至一·三），各井乃纷起追赶，向先进单位看齐，创造了现在的纪录。效率的提高，首先是由于工人发动起来后，改进了工作制度。如过去两班交接空隙长达一个半小时，现改为接班的先下井，交班就不再浪费时间了；六点班过去每小班二十余人，除班长外，打眼、放炮、背碴、卸碴等都无专人负责，现已都选出小组长专管。放炮组炸出石头，装碴组保证及时运走。一号井学习了这个办法，就使整个工作也向前推进了一步。另外，自去年十二月起，工资方面也改变了过去不分工作好坏，每天一律发米八斤的简单办法，采用以进尺为单位计算，激发了劳动的积极性。随着效率的提高，每人工资也普遍提高到十一斤，大家情绪乃更形高涨。（按：该矿现在的工资制度还是很不完善的，但已较前合理一些。）
