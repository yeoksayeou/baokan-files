    Hunan's Industry and Commerce Are Flourishing
    1,300 Factories in Changsha Resume Production
    [Changsha News] Since the liberation of Hunan Province, industry and commerce have been flourishing due to the rapid restoration of water and land transportation. Taking Changsha City as an example, more than 1,300 factories have resumed production, an increase of three times compared to pre-liberation days. According to current statistics, among the handicraft factories that have resumed operations: 125 dyeing and weaving factories have started work, more than 300 native cloth factories have started work, as well as four match factories, three flour mills, and 121 machinery factories. At the same time, various state-owned enterprises in the Central China region have successively established branches in Hunan to promote the exchange of materials in a planned manner. Specialized companies with branches in Changsha include oil and fat, coal and coke, local products, grain, cotton yarn, tea, and other branch companies. Simultaneously, 40 trade companies have been established in various districts, counties, and cities throughout the province. In order to develop local products in Hunan Province, the Hunan Local Products Company is actively processing and transporting tea, bristles, handmade paper, lotus seeds, flax, leather, beeswax, and gallnuts, among other special products. In the counties, since liberation, two gypsum salt mines have started operations in Xiangtan. The pig bristle and shipbuilding industries have resumed operations by about 40%. Machine repair factories have resumed operations by about 50%. All four original rice mills have resumed operations. Other small handicrafts and weaving industries have increased twofold compared to before. In Hengyang, with the assistance of the trade company and the low-price allocation of yarn, 133 cotton weaving factories have resumed operations. In Zhuzhou, most of the 16 original large-scale porcelain factories have resumed operations after obtaining government loans, with over a thousand workers returning to work in the porcelain factories. In Liling, more than 400 fine porcelain and earthenware factories have resumed operations, with over 4,700 workers. The daily output is 5,600 pairs of fine porcelain (vegetable bowls and rice bowls), with 20 bowls per pair; and 23,800 earthenware cylinders, with 10 cylinders per tube. In Liuyang, the handmade weaving industry previously had only 50 looms. Now, with the allocation of cotton yarn by the trade company, it has increased to more than 180 family weaving factories, with a total of more than 1,400 looms. From these various aspects, it can be seen that Hunan is indeed embarking on the road to restoring production. At the same time, the transportation industry, which is closely related to economic development, has achieved brilliant achievements in the past four months. Water and land transportation throughout the province have been restored. Not only have the province's highways been rapidly repaired and connected, but direct buses between Changsha and Nanchang resumed operations on November 16th of last year. The highway from Suoli to Qianjiang on the Xiang-Qian (Sichuan-Hunan) highway has also been opened to traffic. In terms of railways, the Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou), Xiang-Gui (Hunan-Guangxi), and Zhe-Gan (Zhejiang-Jiangxi) three major railways were fully opened to traffic on December 28th. As for shipping, the ships from Changsha to Shanghai and Hankou have long been restored, and the lines to Yichang and Shashi have also been unblocked, guaranteeing the increasing development of industry and commerce in Hunan, and also guaranteeing that Hunan Province will achieve further development in economic construction this year.

    湖南工商业日趋繁荣
    长沙全市千三百家工业复工
    【长沙讯】湖南全境获得解放后，由于水陆交通的迅速恢复，工商业已日趋繁荣。就长沙市言，全市工业先后复工生产的已达一千三百余家，较解放前增加了三倍。复工的手工业厂家，据目前的统计：染织业开工的即已有一二五家，土布业已开工的三百多家，火柴工业四家，面粉厂三家，机械工厂一二一家。同时华中区各公营企业均先后在湘设立分支机构，以有计划地促使内外物资交流。各专业公司在长市设有分支机构者，计有油脂、煤焦、土产、粮食、花纱布、茶叶等分公司，同时全省各区、县、市贸易公司也已先后成立达四十所。湖南土产公司为了发展本省土产，并积极进行茶叶、猪鬃、土纸、莲子、麻、皮革、白腊及五倍子等特产的加工和运销业务。在各县方面，湘潭自解放以来，膏盐矿开工的已有两家，猪鬃、造船业已复工百分之四十上下，机器修造厂复工的百分之五十上下，机米厂原有四家，已全部复工。其他小手工业、织布业较前增多二倍。衡阳的棉织业，经过贸易公司扶助并低价配纱，复工的棉织厂已达一三三家，株州的瓷业工厂原有较大规模的十六家，自获得政府贷款后，大部已复工，有千余工人重回瓷厂工作。醴陵的细瓷、土瓷两业复工的已有四百余家，工人已达四千七百余名，每天的产量为细瓷五千六百对（菜碗饭碗），每对二十只；土瓷二万三千八百筒，每筒十只。浏阳的手工织布业，以前只有织布机五十部，现在经贸易公司配贷棉纱后，已增加到一百八十多个家庭织布厂，共有织布机一千四百多部了。由这种种方面，可以看到湖南目前确已走上恢复生产的大道。同时，与经济发展有密切关系的交通运输事业，四个月来更有辉煌的成就，全省水陆交通均告恢复，不但全省公路已迅速修复贯通，而长沙与南昌的直达汽车，也在去年十一月十六日恢复行驶、湘赣、川湘公路所里至黔江亦已通车，在铁路方面，粤汉、湘桂、浙赣三大铁路，均已于十二月二十八日全线畅通，至于航运方面，则长沙至沪汉的轮船早已恢复，至宜昌、沙市线也已畅通无阻，保证了湖南的工商业日益发展，也保证了湘省在今年在经济建设中，将获得进一步的发展。
