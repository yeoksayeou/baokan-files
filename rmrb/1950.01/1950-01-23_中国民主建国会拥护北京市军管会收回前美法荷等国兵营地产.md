Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 22nd: The spokesperson for the China Democratic National Construction Association issued the following statement regarding the Beijing Military Control Commission's recovery of barracks land in Dongjiaomin Lane from the U.S., France, and the Netherlands:

    The barracks land occupied by the U.S., France, and the Netherlands in Dongjiaomin Lane, Beijing, is a symbol of imperialist aggression against China over the past fifty years. The Chinese people have stood up, and the forces of imperialism have been driven out of mainland China. This remaining symbol absolutely cannot be allowed to continue to exist in our capital. Therefore, the Beijing Military Control Commission's resolute recovery of this land and requisition of its buildings is entirely in accordance with the demands of the people of the whole country. We are very excited to express our extreme support for this reasonable revolutionary measure by the Military Control Commission. Imperialism was extremely alarmed and extremely jealous of the birth of New China, and they will certainly not be reconciled to this measure. Hoping that robbers will be kind and voluntarily spit out their stolen goods is out of the question. However, when the owner has already used their own strength to reclaim the stolen goods, the robbers, even if they are resentful, should remain silent. Imperialist robbers are indeed even more ferocious, and look at the U.S.-led imperialism, which even "argues plausibly" and lodges some kind of protest. The reason it is based on is "violation of the long-standing rights granted to the United States in 1901 and reaffirmed in the 1943 Sino-American Treaty." That is equivalent to saying: "After I snatched it, your 'Qing Dynasty' and 'Chiang Kai-shek,' two internal thieves, have colluded with me and signed a contract of sale, and I have enjoyed this stolen property for nearly fifty years, can it still be taken back?" Look! What a barbaric and ferocious "reason"!

    The hideous face of imperialism only makes us more vigilant and cherish the fruits of the revolution. We must unite more closely under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and strive to complete the revolution and build a new country! We must also strengthen friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, and unremittingly watch the common enemy to ensure lasting international peace. We must thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces of imperialism in China, and uproot the remaining forces of its allies—feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism—before we can complete our mission. Needless to say, while opposing imperialism, we are willing to have friendly relations with the people of the world without discrimination.

### 中国民主建国会拥护北京市军管会收回前美法荷等国兵营地产

    中国民主建国会拥护北京市军管会收回前美法荷等国兵营地产
    【新华社北京二十二日电】民主建国会发言人为北京市军管会收回东交民巷美、法、荷等国兵营地产事发表谈话如下：
    美、法、荷等国在北京东交民巷所占的兵营地产，是五十年来帝国主义侵略中国的标志。中国人民已经站立起来了，帝国主义的势力已经从中国大陆上被驱逐出去了。这一个残留下来的标志，是绝对不能容许在我们的首都继续存在下去的。所以这次京市军管会毅然把这些土地收回，并征用其建筑物，是完全合乎全国人民的要求的。我们对于军管会这项合理的革命的措施，非常兴奋地表示极端拥护。帝国主义对于新中国的诞生，本来是极度的惊惶，又是极度的妒恨的，它们对于这次的措施当然不会甘心。盼望强盗发善心，自愿的吐出赃物，那是没有的事。然而，当着主人已经用自己的力量夺回了赃物的时候，强盗们尽管是心怀忿恨，也应该是俯首无言了，帝国主义强盗的确是更凶狠，且看以美国为首的帝国主义，居然还“振振有辞”的提出什么抗议来了。它所根据的理由，是“违反了一九○一年给予美国的，并在一九四三年中美条约中加以重申的久已存在的权利”。那就等于说：“我抢到手了之后，你家的‘满清’和‘蒋介石’两名内贼，已经和我串通好，立了卖身契了，而且这份赃物，我已经享用了近五十年了，还能要回吗？”看！这是多么横蛮而凶狠的“理由”！
    帝国主义的狰狞面目只有使我们格外提高警觉，格外珍惜革命的成果，我们必须更加紧的团结在中国共产党和毛主席的旗帜之下，为完成革命，建设新国家而努力！我们还要加强对苏联和其他兄弟国家的友好合作，毫不松懈的注视共同的敌人，以保障国际的持久和平。我们必须把帝国主义在中国的残余势力彻底扫除，把它的同盟者——封建主义和官僚资本主义的残余势力，连根挖净，才算达成任务。用不着说，我们一面反对帝国主义，一面对于全世界的人民，是毫无歧视的愿与友好往来的。
