    Tangshan Two Thousand Worker-Peasant Cadres Participate in Formal Part-Time Study; Can Reach Junior High School Graduation Level in Five Years
    [Our Newspaper] The Tangshan City Cadre Spare-time School in Hebei Province has achieved remarkable results in less than a year since its opening in April last year. It is estimated that after five years, the cultural level of the school's 2,200 worker-peasant cadres can be raised to the junior high school graduation level. The school currently has 2,220 students, divided into elementary primary, higher primary, and junior high school sections, with a total of eighteen classes. Classes are held for twelve hours a week, of which two hours are for political education. The teaching plan is as follows: elementary primary section graduates in one and a half years; higher primary section graduates in one year; junior high school section graduates in two and a half years. After six months of study, the students in the first grade of elementary primary school, who were originally illiterate or only knew one or twenty characters and did not recognize Arabic numerals, now recognize six or seven hundred characters and have learned simple arithmetic with four operations, equivalent to the level of the second grade of ordinary elementary primary school. Students in the second grade of elementary primary school, who originally knew one or two hundred characters upon enrollment, can now write short messages and receipts, and their arithmetic skills include multi-digit multiplication and division, equivalent to the level of the third grade of ordinary elementary primary school. Students in the third grade of elementary primary school, who could only write compositions of about one hundred characters upon enrollment, can now produce short essays of five or six hundred characters in two hours, have learned the national phonetic alphabet and punctuation, and their arithmetic skills include the calculation of area, volume, and non-decimal compound numbers, reaching the level of ordinary elementary primary school graduation. Higher primary students can now regularly contribute to wall newspapers or write articles for newspapers, have learned parts of speech, can distinguish the usage of "de" (的, 底, 地), their arithmetic skills include fraction division, and their geography knowledge includes an overview of the northern provinces of China and an understanding of the Earth's formation and natural phenomena such as solar and lunar eclipses, equivalent to the level of the fifth grade of ordinary primary school. During the semester exams, among the 1,182 students who participated in the exams in elementary and higher primary school (the junior high school section started late and did not hold semester exams, and another section had absences due to official duties), 1,098 students were promoted or graduated to higher primary school, accounting for 92%, with an average score of 70 to 80 points or higher. The very few who were held back were mostly due to missed classes due to work. Facts have proven that the predetermined teaching plan (reaching junior high school graduation level in five years) can be completed as scheduled. Currently, the school's two thousand students are studying diligently and full of vitality, breaking the depression that worker-peasant cadres have no culture and cannot cope with complex work.

    【本报讯】河北唐山市干部业余学校，自去年四月开学以来，不到一年时间，已获得显著成绩。预计五年之后，该校二千二百多个工农干部，文化水平可提高到初中毕业程度。该校现有学员二千二百二十人，分初小、高小、初中三部，共十八班。每周上课十二小时，其中二小时为政治课。教学计划为：初小部一年半毕业；高小部一年毕业；初中部二年半毕业。经过六个月的学习，初小一年级的学员，入学时原是文盲或只识一、二十字，不认识阿拉伯字码，现在均识六、七百字，算术学会简单四则，已相当初小二年级程度。初小二年级学员，入学时原识一、二百字，现在能写短信、开收条，算术会多位乘除法，已相当于普通初小三年级程度。初小三年级学员入学时作文不过百字，现在能在两小时内作出五、六百字的短文，学会了国音字母，标点符号，算术学会面积、体积的计算和非十进位复名数，已达到普通初小毕业程度。高小学员，已能经常给壁报或向报纸写稿，学了词类，能分别“的”、“底”、“地”的用法，算术已学会分数除法，地理知道中国北部各省概况，了解地球成因及日、月蚀等自然现象，已相当于普通小学五年级程度。举行学期考试时，初、高小参加考试者一千一百八十二人（初中部开学晚，未举行期考，另一部因公缺考）中，升级及毕业升入高小者，达一千零九十八人，占百分之九十二，成绩平均在七十至八十分以上。极少数留级者亦多因工作误课所致。事实证明，预定之教学计划（五年达到初中毕业水平），可以如期完成。现该校二千余学员均学习紧张，生气勃勃，打破了工农干部没文化，不能应付复杂工作的苦闷。
