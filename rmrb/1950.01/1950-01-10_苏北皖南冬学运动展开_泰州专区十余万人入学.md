    Winter Literacy Campaign Unfolds in Northern Jiangsu and Southern Anhui
    Over 100,000 Enrolled in Taizhou Prefecture
    [Report from this newspaper] The winter literacy campaign has been launched in various parts of Northern Jiangsu and Southern Anhui. In Taizhou Prefecture, Northern Jiangsu (encompassing Taizhou City and seven counties including Taixian and Dongtai), over 2,200 winter literacy classes have been established, with over 100,000 cadres and civilians enrolled. Enrollment in each county has exceeded the planned quota. For example, Hai'an County originally planned to establish 450 classes, but has now reached 600. In Taiping County, Southern Anhui, 81 literacy classes have been established, with 2,452 people regularly participating in learning. Since the start of the campaign, general students have been able to recognize 50 to 100 characters and learn three to five songs. Women in Longmen Village also performed the play "Actively Support the Front Lines to Achieve Liberation" during their studies. Some farmers left one person at home to watch the house while the rest of the family attended winter literacy classes. They voluntarily formed classes and platoons, electing class and platoon leaders to be responsible for supervising learning. Some students voluntarily provided lamp oil for everyone to use for studying. Students in the winter literacy program in Dangtu's Zhajiawan night school also implemented a "little teacher" system. The Guichi Middle School Student Union also organized night schools for farmers and voluntarily donated some of the students' stationery and lamp oil expenses. In response to popular demand, the Ningguo County People's Government specially opened three night schools as models.
    In order to further promote the winter literacy campaign, the Southern Anhui Administrative Office issued supplementary instructions on the winter literacy campaign on December 14 last year, requiring leading organs at all levels to formulate specific plans for the future, closely integrate them with current work, and mobilize and organize various forces to promote this movement. To facilitate the exchange of winter literacy experiences from various locations, the Taizhou Prefectural Office published a "Winter Literacy Campaign Bulletin."
    In the winter literacy campaign, Taiping County has gained several points of experience, which point out that when mobilizing women to attend winter literacy programs, it is necessary to persuade their husbands and mothers-in-law to avoid hindering the women themselves. During winter literacy studies, do not delay learning time by holding meetings, etc. At the same time, do not force students to do things they are not yet able to do (such as acting in plays), so as not to waste time and reduce their enthusiasm for learning.

    苏北皖南冬学运动展开
    泰州专区十余万人入学
    【本报讯】苏北、皖南各地的冬学运动已纷纷展开。苏北区泰州专区（辖泰州市及泰县、东台等七县）已开办冬学二千二百余班，入学的干部群众达十余万人，各县入学人数都超过预定额数。如海安县原计划开办四百五十班，现已达六百班。皖南区太平县已成立八十一个识字班，经常参加学习的达二千四百五十二人。学习以来一般学员都能认五十到一百个字，学会三个到五个歌子。龙门村妇女在学习中并演出“积极支援前线，才能翻身”一剧；有的农民全家留一个看门的，全去上冬学；他们自动组成班排，选出班排长负责督促学习；有的学员自动拿出灯油供大家学习用；有的冬学学员自己打柴解决冬学灯油费。当涂查家湾夜校，并实行小先生制。贵池中学学生会也举办了农民夜校，并自动捐出一部分学员的文具和灯油费。宁国县人民政府根据群众要求，特开办三处夜校作为示范。
    皖南行政公署为使冬学更普遍开展，曾于去年十二月十四日发出冬学补充指示，要求各级领导机关必须订出今后具体计划，密切结合当前工作，动员组织各种力量推动此一运动。泰州专署为交流各地冬学经验，特出版“冬学动态”刊物。
    在冬学运动中，太平县得出几点经验，其中指出：在动员妇女上冬学时，必须打通其丈夫、婆母思想，免使妇女本人遭受阻碍；在冬学学习中，不要以开会等来耽误学习时间；同时对于学员暂时不会作的事（如演戏），不要硬拉他们去作，以免浪费时间，减低学习情绪。
