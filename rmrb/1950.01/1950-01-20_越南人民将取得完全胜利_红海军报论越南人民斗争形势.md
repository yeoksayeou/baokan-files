Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th: The Red Navy Newspaper recently published an article by Podkopaev on the Vietnamese people's struggle for freedom and independence, stating: The young Democratic Republic of Vietnam is victoriously resisting the united imperialist camp. The long colonial war has not only not weakened the republic, but on the contrary, has strengthened its confidence in defeating the enemy and achieving complete victory. The domestic democratic forces have grown significantly. Various progressive groups have joined the Vietnam National United Front. In a short period of time, the Democratic Republic has made tremendous progress in social, economic, and political development. The example of Vietnam vividly illustrates that people liberated from the shackles of colonialism and the oppression of local feudal landlords possess inexhaustible sources of strength.

Podkopaev discussed the main measures taken by the Vietnamese government since the establishment of the republic, and pointed out that the main principle of democratic construction in the Republic of Vietnam is the government's efforts to create the prerequisites as early as possible to develop Vietnam's politics, economy, and culture, fundamentally improve the material welfare of the working people, and raise their living standards and political and cultural levels.

The author emphasized that the epoch-making victory of the Chinese people has greatly facilitated Vietnam's achievement of further victories. With the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Vietnam now has a great peace-loving country on its northern border, instead of that hostile Kuomintang clique.

The author continued: It was revealed not long ago that the French and Americans, in their struggle against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, had a provocative plan to use the Kuomintang troops who fled to Vietnam under the blows of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. However, all these plans to use the Kuomintang and Bao Dai's forces are doomed to failure. In fact, the Bao Dai government established by the French colonialists in the occupied areas has no real power; it is merely propped up by French bayonets. In the occupied areas, French colonialists and their local lackeys are in the midst of a raging fire. Vietnamese guerrillas are everywhere, and the regular army, preparing for a full-scale counter-offensive, is effectively striking at the enemy, eliminating them, and seizing their equipment. The Vietnamese army is launching a major counter-offensive in Cao Bang Province and conducting active operations in southern Vietnam. The intensified activity of the Vietnamese army has caused disputes and low morale in the French aggressors' camp.

The movement of French working people protesting the "ugly war" is also growing stronger.

The author concluded: The broad support of the French working people for the Vietnamese people's national liberation movement, the great achievements of the Chinese people, and the powerful development of the democratic movement led by the Soviet Union worldwide, are inspiring the Vietnamese people to continue their just struggle against the French and American colonialists for the freedom and independence of their motherland. The Vietnamese people will surely achieve complete victory in their just cause.

    越南人民将取得完全胜利
    红海军报论越南人民斗争形势
    【新华社北京十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：红海军报顷刊载波德科巴耶夫论越南人民争取自由与独立的斗争的专文称：年青的越南民主共和国，正胜利地抵抗着联合的帝国主义阵营。长期的殖民战争，不仅没有削弱这个共和国，相反地，却加强了它战败敌人取得完全胜利的信心。国内的民主力量，已大大成长了。各种进步团体都加入了越南民族统一战线。在短短的时间内，民主共和国在社会、经济和政治的发展上有了巨大的进展。越南的例子生动的说明了从殖民地枷锁和当地封建地主的压迫下解放出来的人民，拥有取之不尽用之不竭的力量泉源。
    波德科巴耶夫论及越南政府自共和国成立以来所采取的主要措施，并指出越南共和国民主建设的主要原则，是政府努力尽可能早地创设先决条件，以发展越南的政治、经济与文化，根本改善劳动人民的物质福利，提高他们的生活标准和政治、文化水平。
    作者强调指出：中国人民划时代的胜利，大大地便利了越南取得进一步的胜利。随着中华人民共和国的成立，越南现在在它的北部边境有着一个伟大的爱好和平的国家，而不是那个心怀敌意的国民党集团了。
    作者继称：据不久以前透露，法国和美国人在他们反对越南民主共和国的斗争中，有一个利用那些在中国人民解放军的打击下逃往越南的国民党部队的挑拨性计划。但是，所有这些利用国民党和保大的人马的计划，都是注定了要失败的。事实上，法国殖民者在占领区建立的保大政府，是没有真正的力量的，它不过是法国人用刺刀撑持起来的罢了。在占领区，法国殖民者和他们当地的走狗们正处在四面烽火之中。到处都有越南的游击队，正在准备全力反攻的正规军有效地打击着敌人，消灭敌人，缴获他们的装备。越南军正在高平省大举反攻，并在越南南部进行主动作战。越南军的加紧活动，在法国侵略者阵营中引起了纠纷与士气低落。
    法国劳动人民中抗议“丑恶战争”的运动也日益强大。
    作者结语称：法国劳动人民在道义上对越南人民的民族解放运动的广泛支援，中国人民的伟大业迹，以及全世界在苏联领导下的民主运动强大的发展，鼓舞着越南人民继续对法美殖民者进行正义的斗争，争取自己祖国的自由与独立。越南人民定将取得他们正义事业的完全胜利。
