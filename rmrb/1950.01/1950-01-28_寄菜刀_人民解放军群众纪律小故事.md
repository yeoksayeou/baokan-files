	Returning a Kitchen Knife
	A Small Story of the People's Liberation Army's Mass Discipline
	In late October of last year, when the Second Field Army marched towards the Great Southwest, a certain unit advanced southwestward along the Xiangqian Highway. One day, they traveled eighty li and encamped in Dongkou Town, Wugang County, Xiangxi. The cooking squad comrades opened the pot-carrying poles and the oil-salt carrying poles, preparing to cook dinner. Suddenly, cook Lao Qian took a kitchen knife off the oil-salt carrying pole, carried by Comrade Wang Xiaowu, and shouted anxiously, "Oh no! Oh no! What do we do?" The cooking squad leader quickly asked him, "What's the matter?" He said, "Last night, I borrowed this kitchen knife from a villager in Yizhuang. After using it, I put it on the oil-salt carrying pole, and this morning, we left in a hurry, and Wang Xiaowu carried it all the way here!" Everyone was stunned. Lao Qian continued, "I told that owner, 'Our People's Liberation Army is not like the Kuomintang bandit soldiers. We return what we borrow and compensate for any damage!' Now, we've violated mass discipline. What do you think we should do?" "Eighty li, a round trip of one hundred and sixty li, returning would mean we couldn't catch up with the unit!" someone said. The squad leader thought for a moment and suddenly clapped his hands, saying, "I've got it! When we entered the street just now, I saw a post office on the east side. Let's put a stamp on the kitchen knife and mail it back to the owner. What do you think?" Comrade Wang Xiaowu quickly added, "Let's discuss it and see." Lao Qian took out his only allowance of 1,000 RMB. The squad leader said, "I have 500 RMB. Let's go send it by registered mail. Let's go quickly!" Fortunately, the lights were on in the post office, and someone was sitting next to the desk. As soon as the squad leader entered, he said, "Post office comrade, we're here to mail a kitchen knife." The postal worker quickly stood up and nodded to them, but he didn't understand what they said. Lao Qian put the kitchen knife on the desk and said, "How much does it cost to send a kitchen knife by registered mail?" The postal worker was stunned and shook his head, saying, "This… we've never mailed a kitchen knife before, comrade!" The squad leader, afraid that he wouldn't send it, quickly explained the reason and especially pointed out, "Borrowing things from villagers and not returning them is a violation of mass discipline in our army, which harms the unity between the army and the people and affects the reputation of the People's Liberation Army. Therefore, we must send the kitchen knife back so that the villagers will understand our army." "Oh! Is that so? Then it can be delivered. We have a mailman going that way who can take it." Lao Qian explained the address: go eighty li along Shunshan Road, passing Yizhuang, the fourth household from the west with the door facing south. Then, they both scrambled to pay the postage. Lao Qian said, "The People's Liberation Army emphasizes fairness. There's no reason to send something without paying." The postal worker firmly refused, saying, "Please rest assured and advance, comrades. We will definitely return the kitchen knife to its original owner." After they left, the postal worker was deeply moved by this incident and felt the great responsibility he had, so he added to the piece of paper with the address of the kitchen knife owner the sentence Lao Qian said when he left: "The People's Liberation Army does not take a single needle or thread from the people!" The next day, the mailman took the kitchen knife and the note back to the original owner.

    寄菜刀
    人民解放军群众纪律小故事
    去年十月下旬，第二野战军向大西南进军时，某部顺着湘黔公路向西南挺进，一天走了八十里地，在湘西武岗县的洞口镇宿营。炊事班同志打开锅挑子和油盐挑子准备煮晚饭。炊事员老钱忽然从王小五同志抬的油盐挑子上解下来一把菜刀，很着急地大喊：“糟啊！糟啊！怎办啦？”炊事班长忙问他：“怎么回事？”他说：“昨晚上在义庄借了老乡的这把菜刀，我用完放在油盐挑子上，今天早上走的急，被王小五挑到这里来了！”大家都怔住了，老钱又说：“我对那位老板说好的：“咱解放军可不和国民党匪兵一样，咱们借东西用了就还，搞坏了赔偿！”这下可是犯了群众纪律呀，你们看怎办！”“八十里，来回一百六，返回去就再赶不上部队了！”有人这样说。班长想了一想，猛然拍手说：“有了，刚才进街时，我看见东头有个邮局，咱们就把菜刀贴上邮票寄去还给老板，看行不行”。王小五同志忙接上一句：“去商量一下看。”老钱就掏出了自己仅有的津贴费人民币一千元。班长说：“我还有五百元，咱们去寄个双挂号，走，快点！”正好邮局里点着灯，有个人坐在办公桌旁边。班长一进去就说：“邮局同志，我们来寄个菜刀。”邮局的人忙站起来向他俩点头，但没有听懂他们说的话。老钱就将菜刀放在桌上说：“用双挂号寄把菜刀，得多少钱？”邮局的人可呆住了，摇了摇头说：“这个……我们从来没有寄过菜刀呀，同志！”班长怕他不肯寄，赶忙说明了原因，又特别说明：“借了老乡东西不还，在我们部队里就是违犯群众纪律，妨害了军民团结，要影响解放军名誉的，所以一定得把菜刀送回去，老乡对咱们军队才会明了。”“噢！这么回事吗，那可以带，我们有顺路邮差带去就是。”老钱就说明了地址：顺山路走八十里，路过义庄，从西数第四户门朝南那家。接着，他们又争着要付邮资，老钱说：“解放军讲公平，那有寄东西不给钱的道理。”邮局的同志却坚决拒绝，说：“请同志们放心进军吧，保险把菜刀带还给原主。”他们走后，邮局的同志深深被这件事情感动，更感到自己责任的重大，就又在写着菜刀主人地址的那张纸上，添了老钱临走时说的那句话：“解放军不拿人民一针一线！”第二天，邮差就把菜刀和纸条一起带还了原主。
