    Some Experiences and Opinions on Solving Textbook Problems in Cadre Schools
    Xu Cheng
    The Xinxian Special District Cadre School was originally a cadre cultural remedial class. The students were district and county cadres transferred from various counties, and some family members of southward-bound cadres. The entire school had more than 120 people, all of whom were semi-literate or illiterate. Our educational plan was to have each person "recognize over a thousand characters and read newspapers without worry" within half a year. Faced with this situation, selecting teaching materials became a very difficult task. Due to lack of experience, we researched, experimented, and improved along the way. The following are our experiences and opinions.
    Regarding Chinese language materials. Because the students have quite rich life experiences, social knowledge, and work experience, although they lack a cultural foundation, they are not interested in generalized materials. We must start with literacy education, but we cannot teach it too simply; they want to "learn something meaningful," but they cannot accept anything too profound. Selecting elementary school textbooks is unsuitable because the objects in the texts are not chosen for adults; selecting middle school textbooks, if the content has little connection with their learning materials, the learning effect is also not great. If the lessons are too long, they do not recognize enough characters to keep up; if the lessons are too short, the content is not easily enriched, and they are not interested in learning. Therefore, very little of the old material is suitable, and we only selected a small portion. Based on the principle of improving cultural level mainly through Chinese language courses, and implementing the entire education plan of the cadre school, we edited new learning materials, and the problem was initially solved, but it still needs to be continuously improved.
    In terms of natural science, we do not yet have a sufficient understanding of the importance of this course. Natural science plays a significant role in establishing a communist worldview. Those with low levels of education are extremely likely to fall into the superstitious quagmire of idealism. Therefore, to establish a worldview that does not believe in superstition, does not yield, dares to analyze all things, and deeply believes in the power of the people, we should first expose the superstitious ideas passed down through generations about solar eclipses, lunar eclipses, wind, rain, thunder, lightning, air, etc. in the cadre school. Our understanding of this point is relatively poor, and the natural science teaching materials only selected some materials related to natural science in daily life (including physiology and hygiene), which is not enough.
    In history, we considered that historical knowledge should be taught in a relatively systematic manner. However, with only one hour per week for half a year, it is impossible to give a comprehensive and systematic lecture on Chinese history. Therefore, the unanimous opinion is to teach modern revolutionary history, but revolutionary history is limited to knowledge of revolutionary movements. If we look at cadres gradually improving their historical knowledge in the long term, we must appropriately supplement the materials. In addition, there is also an important issue. When we teach historical knowledge, we often create a side effect, unconsciously becoming disseminators of bourgeois ideology and introducing erroneous concepts passed down through generations in tradition. Therefore, how to criticize the feudal and capitalist ideological remnants hidden in our consciousness, correctly interpret Chinese history, and correctly interpret the relationship between social development and individual roles are issues worthy of attention and research.
    Regarding the teaching materials for political classes (excluding current events), we initially focused on selecting some new things in political, economic, and cultural construction, such as cooperatives and agricultural taxes in the new democratic economy. Most students did not easily accept these materials. Currently, we believe that political classes should mainly teach some basic concepts of historical materialism first, such as labor creating the world, productivity promoting social development, class struggle, etc.; secondly, knowledge of the Party; in the weeks before graduation, we can talk about some new knowledge in various aspects of building a new democratic country.

    干部学校解决教材问题的几点体验和意见
    许诚
    忻县专区干部学校原来是一个干部文化补习班，学员是各县调来的区、县干部和一部分南下干部家属。全校一百二十余人，都是半文盲或文盲。我们的教育计划，是希望半年内使每人“识下千余字，看报不发愁。”针对这种情况，选择教材成为一个很困难的工作。因为缺乏经验，我们边研究，边试验，边改进，以下是我们的几点体验和意见。
    关于国文材料。因为学员都有相当丰富的生活经验、社会知识和工作经验，虽然没有文化基础，但一般化的材料他们不感兴趣。既要从识字教起，又不能教得太简单；他们要“学有意思的”，但深了也接受不了。选小学课本，由于课文中的事物不是为成人选择的，所以也不适合；选中学课本，如果内容上和他们联系较少的学习材料，学习效果也不大。课文长了，他们认字少，认不过来；课文短了，内容就不容易充实，他们学起来不感兴趣。因此旧的东西很少有适用的，我们只选了一小部分。我们根据通过国文课提高文化程度为主的方针，并贯彻干校的整个教育计划，编辑了新的学习材料，问题才得到初步解决，但仍须继续改进。
    在自然科学方面，我们对这门课程的重要性还认识不够，自然科学对于共产主义世界观的建立是有其极大作用的。文化程度低的极容易陷入迷信的唯心论泥坑中。因此，要树立起不迷信不屈服敢于分析一切事物深信人民力量的世界观，在干校中应该首先把日蚀、月蚀、风雨、雷、电、空气等世代相传下来的迷信观念予以揭破，我们对这一点认识较差，自然科学的教材只选择了些日常生活上与自然科学有联系的材料（包括生理卫生在内），这是不够的。
    在历史方面，我们考虑到历史知识是应该比较有系统地讲授的。但半年的时间，每周只上一小时，要把中国历史作一概括性的有系统的讲授是不可能的。所以一致的意见是讲近代革命史，但革命史又局限于革命运动方面的知识，如果为干部长期的逐渐提高其历史知识上看，就必须适当地加以补充材料。此外，还有一个重要的问题，我们在讲授历史知识时，时常起一种副作用，无形中作了资产阶级思想意识的传播者，引入传统中世代相承下来的错误观念。因此，如何批判我们意识中所潜藏的封建的与资本主义的思想残余，正确地解释中国历史，正确地解释社会发展与个人作用的关系，是值得重视与研究的问题。
    关于政治课（不包括时事）的教材，开始时我们着重选择一些新的政治经济文化建设方面的东西，如新民主主义经济中的合作社、农业税等，这种材料大部分学员不容易接受。目前我们认为政治课主要应先讲授一些唯物史观的基本概念，如劳动创造世界、生产力推动社会的发展、阶级斗争等等；其次为党的知识；到将毕业前的几个星期，可以讲一些建设新民主主义国家在多方面的新的知识。
