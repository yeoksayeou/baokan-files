Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th – A massive tragedy of persecution against Overseas Chinese has recently occurred in northern Vietnam. French troops stationed in Vietnam have committed acts of rape, arson, and looting against our Overseas Chinese compatriots, causing severe losses to their lives and property. Our agency has received a telegram signed by Huang Danian, Zhang Jianmin, and Mei Zhannan, the presidium of the first joint conference of Overseas Chinese Councils from ten provinces in northern Vietnam, stating: The two villages of Qingling and Liugang in Yong'an province, northern Vietnam, have a total population of over 160, all of whom are Overseas Chinese. On the night of November 19th last year, over a hundred French and Bảo Đại troops suddenly surrounded the two villages, drove all male Overseas Chinese to a drying ground, lined them up, and forced them to run around the field. Those who walked too slowly or too fast were immediately whipped for their amusement. The whipping lasted for thirty minutes, and half of the Overseas Chinese were injured. The chairman of the Overseas Chinese Council, who was over sixty years old, was beaten until his whole body was swollen and painful. At the same time, the French troops gathered all female Overseas Chinese in another place and carried out gang rape. The wife of an Overseas Chinese named Huang, who was eight months pregnant, was chased by French troops, resulting in a miscarriage and tragic death. After satisfying their bestial desires, the French troops forced the villagers to kill chickens and pigs for a feast. After the meal, they ransacked the houses, looting all clothes and money, along with the uneaten chickens, ducks, pigs, and cattle. Before leaving, the French troops set fire to the houses and granaries. The telegram stated: The French troops in Vietnam have repeatedly committed atrocities against the lives, property, and dignity of our Overseas Chinese compatriots. Recently, in Dongrong village, Guangdong province, Vietnam, the French troops burned all Overseas Chinese houses, furniture, and grain, and looted all the livestock. In Dongjiao village, Hongji Special Zone, three members of the Li family, father and sons, were brutally murdered by French soldiers. The details of the Qingling and Liugang tragedy in Yong'an province were obtained through an investigation by representatives attending the joint conference who personally went to Yong'an province. The telegram concluded with an appeal: "We fervently hope that our compatriots throughout the country who have already been liberated will, with fraternal affection, unanimously support our suffering and insulted brothers and sisters abroad so that they can share the happiness of the People's Republic of China. We will resolutely lead the Overseas Chinese in the ten provinces, pledge to be the government's strong backing, and unite to avenge the dead Overseas Chinese, and fight to the end to redress the grievances of the insulted and harmed Overseas Chinese."
