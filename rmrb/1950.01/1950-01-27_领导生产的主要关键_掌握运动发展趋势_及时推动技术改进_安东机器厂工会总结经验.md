    Promptly Promoting Technological Improvements
    The Anton Machine Factory Union Summarizes Experience

    [Reported from this paper's Northeast Bureau] The Anton Machine Factory Union has tightly grasped the policy of restoring and developing production, and has promptly summarized its leadership experience, proving that in the movement to create new production records, promoting technological improvements in a timely manner based on the development trends of the movement is the main key to leading production. Before the new record movement unfolded, the union proactively improved the gear hobbing in the lathe workshop, changing the old method from 44 threads per inch to 30 threads per inch. At the time, this was met with opposition from some workers, especially some older workers who feared that this improvement would reduce their technical prestige, and the resistance was great. Addressing this thinking, the union repeatedly conducted education on aligning individual interests with national interests, clearing up ideological obstacles. On the other hand, union cadres focused on mobilizing activists and Party members to take the lead in implementing this improved method in their work, and helped the activists to further improve it by increasing the depth of cut, achieving success. This finally broke through this conservative resistance and quickly promoted the widespread improvement of cutting speeds among workers. After the movement gained momentum, based on improving cutting speeds, they continued to promote the cultivation of workers in improving work methods and various aspects of the machines, universally improving the lathe tools, replacing them with larger pulleys, speeding up the lathe spindles, and designing various tools. Among the old technical workers and individual skilled workers who were ideologically more conservative, they carried out patient educational work to unite and win them over. Regarding the deputy technician and lathe workshop director who was unwilling to advance and stuck to old ways, in accordance with the opinions of the masses, and after consultation with the administration, it was decided to transfer him to other work, only performing simple deputy technician work, so as not to hinder the enthusiasm of on-site workers in creating new records. In addition, a campaign was launched to establish master-apprentice contracts. Thirteen veteran workers with more than 20 years of experience are now active backbones in the workshop's new record movement. An apprenticeship examination system was implemented. After the examination, thirty-two of the one hundred and two apprentices have already begun operating lathes. The new record movement exposed many unreasonable phenomena in production. The union then mobilized workers to make suggestions for rationalizing production, putting forward more than one hundred suggestions for improving tools, machines, systems, labor organization, welfare, and safety facilities. The union promptly organized and summarized these rationalization suggestions and opinions, and jointly studied them with the administration, discussed them at the management committee and resolved them, thus enabling the workers' production enthusiasm to continue to be consolidated and enhanced. The factory's original production plan for the third and fourth quarters of 1949 was scheduled from August 29th of last year to mid-March of this year. However, after two months and thirteen days of the new record movement, 263 people created 167 new records, of which 42 were improvements to tools, 37 were improvements to work methods, and 18 were inventions. And based on the new standards, quota management was initially implemented. Therefore, after re-accurately calculating the past production plan on December 1st, the overall task could be completed one month ahead of schedule, by February 15, 1950. The entire factory is now working hard to achieve this task.

    安东机器厂工会总结经验
    【本报东北讯】安东机器厂工会紧紧掌握了恢复发展生产的方针及时总结领导经验，证明在创造生产新纪录运动中，根据运动的发展趋势，及时推动技术改进，是领导生产的主要关键。在新纪录运动展开前，工会即首先在车工场主动将牙轮由老的一套牙轮挂法一英寸四十四扣改进一英寸三十扣，当时曾遭到某些工人的反对，特别是个别的老工人怕这样改进要降低他们的技术威信，阻力很大。工会针对这个思想，反复的进行个人利益与国家利益一致的教育，打通思想，另一方面通过工会干部抓紧积极分子、党员，在工作中带头实现这一改进方法，并帮助积极分子，继续改进加大了吃刀量，获得成功，终于突破这种保守的阻力，迅速推动工人普遍的改进了切削速度。运动起来后，在改进切削速度的基础上，又继续推动培养工人在工作方法和机器各方面改进，普遍的改进了车刀，与换大了皮带轮，加快了车床子的转数，设计各种工具。在老技术工人与个别技术好但是思想比较保守的工人中，进行了团结、争取的耐心教育工作。对不愿前进、墨守成规的副技师兼车工场主任，依照群众意见，经与行政协商，决定调换工作，只作单纯的副技师工作，以免妨碍现场工人创造新纪录的积极性。另外还发动订立师徒合同，有二十年工龄以上的十三名老工人，现在都是车间的创造新纪录运动的积极骨干；实行考徒制，一百零二名学徒经过考试以后，已有三十二名开始操纵车床子。在新纪录运动中暴露了生产上许多不合理现象，工会就发动工人进行生产合理化建议，提出了改进工具、机器、制度、劳动组织、福利、安全设施等一百多条的建议，工会及时把这些合理化建议与意见整理，并与行政共同研究、在管理委员会上进行讨论与解决，因而使工人的生产热情继续巩固与提高。该厂一九四九年第三、四季生产计划原订自去年八月二十九日到今年三月中旬。但经过两个月零十三天的新纪录运动，有二六三人创造新纪录一六七件，其中四十二件是改进工具，三十七件是改进工作方法，十八件是创造发明。并依据新的标准，初步实行了定额管理，故于十二月一日将过去的生产计划重新精确的计算之后，总的任务可以提前一个月，到一九五○年二月十五日完成。现全厂正为实现这一任务而努力。
