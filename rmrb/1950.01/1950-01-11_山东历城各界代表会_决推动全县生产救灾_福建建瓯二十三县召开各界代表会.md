    [Reported by this Newspaper] Various localities are paying close attention to convening people's representative conferences from all walks of life to unite people from all strata and, based on local specific conditions, solve some of the most pressing current issues. Licheng County, Shandong, convened a people's representative conference from all walks of life in late December of last year. The conference discussed and approved a resolution on the county's production and disaster relief work for the next three months. The resolution included developing mass-based sideline production, promoting thrift, launching social mutual aid, carrying out winter manure accumulation, protecting and rewarding livestock breeding, establishing New Area Farmers' Associations to prepare for land reform, confirming old area land rights, and developing winter schools. In order to promote the implementation of the resolution, the conference also established three committees for production and disaster relief, mountain fruit sales, and stone quarrying.
    In Fujian Province, twenty-three counties, including Jian'ou, Jianyang, Gutian, Nanping, Lianjiang, Luoyuan, Jinjiang, Xianyou, Nan'an, Linsen, Minqing, Fuqing, Changle, and Pingtan, have successively held their first people's representative conferences from all walks of life between November and December of last year. The people's governments of each county respectively made work reports to the representatives on the work since liberation and reviewed the shortcomings in their administration. Based on Fujian Province's current tasks of suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent, and collecting grain to support the front, the conferences specifically discussed and approved the administrative policies of each county. Representatives from each county also raised and solved many problems according to the actual local conditions. For example, Pingtan, Minqing, Jinjiang, and other counties in the coastal areas of eastern and southern Fujian, passed proposals on developing the fishing and salt industries, building sea dikes, and foreign remittances. Putian, Xianyou, Gutian, Jian'ou and other counties passed resolutions on organizing winter plowing and prohibiting the slaughter of draft cattle. Jian'ou County also solved the problem of relief funds for poor students. Worker and peasant representatives from Nan'an County put forward proposals to organize women's and adult literacy classes.
