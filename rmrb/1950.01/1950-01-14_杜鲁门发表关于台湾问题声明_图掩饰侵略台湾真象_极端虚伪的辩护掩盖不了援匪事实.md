Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 13th: According to a United Press report from Washington: Amidst the vehement condemnation from the Chinese people and progressive world opinion against the American imperialist aggression in Taiwan, U.S. President Truman issued a statement on Taiwan this month on the fifth. In this statement, Truman, on the one hand, had to admit that Taiwan is Chinese territory and that it was returned to China after Japan's surrender, as stipulated in the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration. On the other hand, he tried his best to conceal the truth of American aggression against Taiwan and the continued aid to the remnant bandits in Taiwan to interfere in China's internal affairs.

The full text of Truman's statement is as follows:

"The United States Government has always held a benevolent attitude towards international relations. The traditional policy of the United States towards China is exemplified by the Open Door Policy, which calls for international respect for China's territorial integrity. This principle was reaffirmed by the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 8th of last year. That resolution called for all countries to refrain from: 1. Seizing spheres of influence within Chinese territory and establishing regimes controlled by foreign forces. 2. Seeking special rights or privileges within Chinese territory. The aforementioned principle is particularly applicable to Taiwan in the current situation. In the Cairo Declaration of December 1, 1943, the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and the Chairman of China declared that their purpose was that territories Japan had stolen from China, such as Taiwan, should be returned to China. The United States was a signatory to the Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945. The Potsdam Declaration stated that the terms of the Cairo Declaration should be implemented. Japan also accepted the provisions of this declaration upon surrender. To implement the above declarations, Taiwan was handed over to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. For the past four years, the United States and other allies have also recognized China's right to exercise authority over the island. The United States has never had any ambition to plunder Taiwan or other Chinese territories. The United States has no intention of acquiring special rights or privileges or establishing military bases in Taiwan. The United States also does not intend to use armed forces to intervene in its current situation. The United States government does not intend to follow any path that would involve the United States in China's internal strife. Similarly, the United States government does not intend to provide military assistance or consultation to the Chinese army in Taiwan. In the view of the United States government, Taiwan's resources are sufficient for the Chinese government to obtain the supplies it deems necessary to defend Taiwan. The United States government intends to continue the current Economic Cooperation Administration's economic aid program under existing legislative authority.”

	American Ships Still Loading Munitions Bound for Taiwan

Commentators here point out that Truman's defense of American imperialism's aggression against China, especially against Taiwan, is extremely hypocritical. The so-called "Open Door Policy" is actually a policy of aggression. For more than a century, American imperialism has been dividing China's territorial sovereignty with various imperialists under the guise of the "Open Door." Since Japan's surrender, American imperialism has intensified its aggression against China and supported the Kuomintang bandit gang in launching a counter-revolutionary civil war to attack the Chinese people. After the Kuomintang bandit gang failed on the Chinese mainland, it made special efforts to carry out various acts of aggression in Taiwan and aided the remnant bandits in Taiwan with large amounts of military weapons to continue their struggle. These are facts known to the world, which cannot be concealed by Truman's statement. On the same day that Truman claimed that "the United States does not intend to provide military assistance to the Chinese army in Taiwan," his Secretary of State Acheson told the press that "the Kuomintang in Taiwan can still legally purchase American weapons." (According to Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th). Two days later, according to a Nationalist Party Taiwan News Agency report, on the 7th, "two American ships loaded with a batch of American aid materials arrived in Keelung." Five days later, a United Press report from Philadelphia on the 10th reported that the Turkish ship Martin began loading munitions in Philadelphia on the 10th, bound for Taiwan. The cost of each tank was $58,000, but it was sold to the Kuomintang for $1,000. In the face of these facts, how can Truman justify himself?!

	American Imperialists' Conspiracy of Armed Aggression Against Taiwan Has Not Died

At the same time that Truman issued his statement, Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th, reported that Acheson, in explaining Truman's statement to the press, emphasized that "Truman said that the United States has 'temporarily' no intention of establishing bases in Taiwan. This means that in the event of an armed attack on American forces in the Far East, the situation would be completely different. In this case, American troops would have to freely take all measures it deems appropriate." Acheson's words clearly revealed that the American imperialists' conspiracy to occupy Taiwan by armed force has not died. Whenever it deems it necessary in the future, it can create an excuse of "armed attack on American forces" to implement this criminal plan of aggression.

### 杜鲁门发表关于台湾问题声明  图掩饰侵略台湾真象  极端虚伪的辩护掩盖不了援匪事实

    杜鲁门发表关于台湾问题声明
    图掩饰侵略台湾真象
    极端虚伪的辩护掩盖不了援匪事实
    【新华社北京十三日电】据合众社华盛顿讯：在我国人民以及世界进步舆论猛烈抨击美帝国主义侵略台湾声中，美总统杜鲁门于本月五日发表了一项关于台湾的声明。这个声明中，杜鲁门在一方面不得不承认台湾是中国的领土，并早于日本投降后按照开罗会议宣言和波茨坦宣言规定归还中国的事实；另一方面却又极力掩饰美国侵略台湾和继续援助台湾残匪干涉中国内政的真象。
    杜鲁门的声明全文如下：
    “美国政府对于国际关系向来抱有善意的态度。美国对中国的传统政策可以门户开放政策为例证，要求国际上尊重中国的领土完整。这一原则为联合国大会去年十二月八日通过的决议案予以重申。该案要求一切国家不得：一、在中国领土内攫取势力范围建立由外力控制的政权。二、在中国领土内追求特别权益或特权。前述的原则在目前的局势下对于台湾特别适用。在一九四三年十二月一日的开罗宣言中美国总统、英国首相及中国主席曾申明他们的目的是：日本自中国夺去的领土如台湾应当归还中国。美国是一九四五年七月二十六日波茨坦宣言的签字国。波茨坦宣言称，开罗宣言条款应予执行。日本于投降时亦曾接受此宣言的规定。为实践以上各项宣言，台湾即交给蒋介石委员长。过去四年来美国及其他盟国亦承认中国得对该岛行使权力。美国对台湾或中国其他领土从无掠夺的野心。现在美国亦无意在台湾获取特别权益或特权或建立军事基地。美国亦不拟使用武装部队干预其现在的局势，美国政府不拟遵循任何足以把美国卷入中国内争中的途径。同样地美国政府也不拟对在台湾的中国军队供给军事援助或咨询。在美国政府看来，台湾的资源已足能使中国政府获得认为是保卫台湾所必需的物品。美国政府拟在立法方面授予的现有权力下继续进行目前的经济合作署的经济援助计划。”
            美轮仍在装载军火运往台湾
    此间人士指出：杜鲁门在他的声明中关于美帝国主义侵略中国，特别是侵略台湾的辩护是极端虚伪的。所谓“门户开放政策”实即侵略政策。百年多来，美帝国主义即在“门户开放”的名义下，与各帝国主义瓜分中国的领土主权。日本投降以来，美帝国主义更加紧对于中国的侵略，并支持国民党匪帮发动反革命内战，进攻中国人民。当国民党匪帮在中国大陆失败后，便特别努力在台湾进行各种侵略活动，并以大量军火武器援助台湾残匪继续挣扎。这些都是举世尽知的事实，这决非杜鲁门的一纸声明所能掩盖的。在杜鲁门声称“美国不拟对在台湾的中国军队供给军事援助”的同天，他的国务卿艾奇逊就向报界说：“台湾的国民党仍能依法购买美国武器。”（据法新社华盛顿五日电）过了两天，据国民党台湾新闻社电，七日“有美轮两艘由美装运美援物资一批到达基隆。”隔了五天，合众社费城十日电即报道说：土尔其轮船马丁号于十日在费城开始装载军火运往台湾。其中坦克车的造价每辆为五万八千美元，而卖给国民党的价格则是一千美元。在这些事实面前，杜鲁门将何以自圆其说呢？！
            美帝武装侵台阴谋并未死心
    就在杜鲁门发表声明的同时，据法新社华盛顿五日电报道，艾奇逊在向报界阐释杜鲁门声明时却强调说：“杜鲁门说美国‘暂时’无意在台湾建立基地，这意味着在远东的美军遭到武装进攻的情形下，情势就迥然不同了，在这种情形下美国军队就不得不自由地采取一切它认为合适的措施。”艾奇逊的话明白泄露了美国帝国主义者对武装侵占台湾的阴谋计划并未死心，只要在将来它认为必要时，即可以随时制造一个“美军遭到武装进攻”的借口，实行这个罪恶的侵略计划。
