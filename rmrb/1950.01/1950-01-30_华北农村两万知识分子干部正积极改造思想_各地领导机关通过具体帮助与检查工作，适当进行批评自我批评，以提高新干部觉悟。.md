Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th—The 20,000 intellectual cadres who graduated from North China University, North China People's Revolutionary University, and Shanxi Public School and are working in rural North China are now actively transforming themselves in their work, striving to serve the people better. After arriving at their posts, the majority of these cadres showed enthusiasm for their work, were not afraid of hardship, and humbly learned from worker and peasant cadres, thus making rapid progress and changing their initial "visiting revolution" attitude. However, some new cadres, because their worldview of serving the people has not been truly established and consolidated, have more or less incorrect views in their thinking, such as looking down on workers and peasants and looking down on labor. At the same time, they lack practical struggle experience, so when they encounter difficulties, they are easily invaded by old, incorrect ideologies. For example, some cadres look down on farmers, think the countryside is too dirty, cannot get used to rural life, are nostalgic for city life, and want to work in places with convenient transportation, so they cannot settle down in their current rural work. Some veteran cadres, because they do not fully understand their feelings and have not given them appropriate help in a timely manner, and because there are some differences in living habits between them, have formed a gap between new and veteran cadres in some places. According to the above situation, the leading organs in various places are trying to improve the situation, first of all by giving new cadres free rein and appropriately carrying out criticism and self-criticism from the specific help and inspection of their work, and constantly improving the political consciousness of new cadres. For example, some counties in Hebei and Chahar provinces have adopted the method of holding a general cadre meeting to evaluate merits, combining criticism and commendation, which has greatly encouraged the advancement of new cadres. Shanxi and other provinces have generally held symposiums for new cadres to allow them to raise difficulties and opinions in their work, help them analyze and solve them, and inspire them to further examine their shortcomings, which has achieved great results. At the same time, leading organs in various places have also called on veteran cadres to consciously assume the responsibility of uniting, educating, and transforming new cadres. Veteran cadres in Anxin County, Hebei Province, led new cadres to work in the countryside together, and before carrying out the work, they jointly studied and arranged the work in advance, cultivated their interest in rural work, and improved their ability to work independently.

    华北农村两万知识分子干部正积极改造思想
    各地领导机关通过具体帮助与检查工作，适当进行批评自我批评，以提高新干部觉悟。
    【新华社北京二十八日电】分配在华北农村工作的两万个华北大学、华北人民革命大学、山西公学毕业的知识分子干部，现正在工作中积极地改造自己，以求更好地为人民服务。这批干部到达工作岗位后，多数都表现对工作热情、不怕艰苦、虚心向工农干部学习，因而进步很快，改变了开始参加工作的“参观革命”的态度。但是也有一部分新干部，由于他们为人民服务的人生观没有真正建立和巩固起来，思想上或多或少的存在着轻视工农、轻视劳动等不正确观点，同时缺乏实际斗争的锻炼，因此当一遇到困难，就容易被旧的不正确的思想意识所侵袭。如有的干部看不起农民，认为农村太脏，过不惯农村生活，留恋城市生活，想在交通便利的地方工作，因而不能安心于现在的农村工作。而部分老干部因不很了解他们的这种心情，没有及时地予以适当帮助，加上彼此生活习惯上有些不同，因此在某些地方曾形成新老干部间的隔膜。各地领导机关根据上述情况，正设法注意改进，首先是放手使用新干部，从具体帮助和检查他们的工作中，适当地进行批评与自我批评，不断提高新干部的政治觉悟。如河北、察哈尔省的部分县份采取召开全体干部会评功的办法，使批评与表扬结合起来，大大鼓舞了新干部的前进心。山西等省普遍召开新干部座谈会，让他们提出工作中的困难和意见，帮助他们进行分析、解决，启发他们进一步检查自己的缺点等，收到很大效果。同时，各地领导机关，又号召老干部自觉地负起团结教育与改造新干部的责任。河北安新县老干部带领新干部一同下乡工作，在进行工作之前，预先共同研究和布置工作，培养他们对农村工作的兴趣，并提高他们独立工作的能力。
