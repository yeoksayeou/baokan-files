Political and Scientific Knowledge to the Masses

The Soviet society is confidently advancing along the road to communism, and the Soviet people's socialist consciousness and cultural level are growing and improving day by day. Our Party is successfully completing one of the important tasks of communist construction—to make all workers and peasants cultured and educated, and to raise the cultural and technical level of the working class to the technical level of engineers.

Comrade Stalin pointed out: "Only such a high cultural and technical level of the working class can break the basis of the opposition between mental and physical labor, and can guarantee such high labor productivity and sufficient daily necessities necessary for the transition from socialism to communism."

The large-scale socialist competition to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule vividly reflects the improvement of the cultural and technical level of the Soviet working class. The creative leading role in labor is demonstrated by millions of production innovators, who are advanced, highly conscious people, and active participants in the struggle to improve technology. Collective farms are constantly promoting thousands of agricultural advanced individuals and socialist labor heroes from their members.

The continued improvement of the cultural level of the people and communist education are one of the important conditions for the successful completion of the task of communist construction. The higher the socialist consciousness of the workers, the stronger their political and labor enthusiasm. This is why the Party attaches such importance to the communist education of workers and the dissemination of political and scientific knowledge.

Public speaking and propaganda occupy a prominent position in the communist education of workers. In recent years, Party organizations have achieved significant improvements in the organization of public speaking and propaganda. The lecture groups of the Party Central Committees, border region committees, state committees, and municipal committees of various allied republics have strengthened their activities. They have begun to give more lectures on theory and Party history. The All-Union Association for the Popularization of Political and Scientific Knowledge is carrying out tremendous work. In the past two years, members of the association have given more than 20,000 lectures, and tens of millions of workers have attended.

However, the scope of public speaking and propaganda and the political and ideological level of the lectures (the main thing) have not yet met the high requirements put forward by the Party. Up to now, public speaking and propaganda have mostly been held in large cities—in the large central cities of border regions, states, and republics.

A particularly urgent issue is to thoroughly improve the propaganda of political and scientific knowledge in rural areas. The face of collective farms has been completely changed, and the demand for spiritual food of collective farm members is constantly growing, and agricultural culture is also improving. Many rural areas have completed comprehensive electrification and radio broadcasting, and other rural areas are moving in this direction. The Soviet state is arming socialist agriculture with the latest technology on an ever-expanding scale. All this cannot but strengthen—and has actually strengthened—the collective farm members', tractor station and Soviet farm workers' thirst for knowledge and culture, but this ever-growing demand for spiritual food of rural workers is often neglected in public speaking and propaganda.

Moreover, we have all the conditions to organize extensive public speaking and propaganda on the ideas of Lenin and Stalin and the achievements of Soviet science and culture. The Soviet intelligentsia has millions of experts in various sciences, who can give specialized lectures based on their different knowledge. In any rural area of the country, there are dozens of teachers, agricultural experts, doctors and other experts working there.

In many republics, border regions, and state Party organizations, rural intellectuals have been absorbed to participate in public speaking, and the propaganda of political and scientific knowledge in these places is also proceeding normally. Hundreds of public speaking organizations have been established, with thousands of lecturing scientists participating in the work. However, on a national scale, public speaking and propaganda work has only absorbed a very small part of our huge cultural strength. There are only 40,000 formal members and 20,000 alternate members in the All-Union Association for the Popularization of Political and Scientific Knowledge. Participation in the communist education of workers is the patriotic duty of every Soviet intellectual.

Undoubtedly, the broadest strata of the Soviet intelligentsia are fully prepared and hope to participate in public speaking and propaganda work. It is only necessary for the Party organizations, the All-Union Association for the Popularization of Political and Scientific Knowledge, and the committees of cultural and educational organs to be good at absorbing our intellectuals to participate in this important and glorious work, and to provide regular work and leadership for the lecturers—first of all, the scope of public speaking and propaganda and its political and ideological level. Therefore, the considerable number of lecturing scientific cadres should educate themselves in the spirit of Bolshevik requirements—high ideology, close ties with life, specificity, and political purpose.

Quality and ideological content are the main things in the political and scientific education work of the masses. In the actual work of public speaking, there are still serious shortcomings. Many lectures are of low quality, often giving boring platitudes, with little connection to the specific tasks of economic and cultural construction, and insufficient attention to the propaganda of natural science knowledge and the struggle against those prejudices and nonsense. A serious shortcoming of some lectures is: the language is dry and uninteresting, the words are inexpressive, and sometimes difficult to understand. The lecturers are not good at arousing the audience's interest in the lecture.

All state and social organizations and Party organizations engaged in the propaganda of political and scientific knowledge must improve their leadership and often correct and check the work of public speaking.

The propaganda of the invincible ideas of Lenin and Stalin, the explanation of the important measures of the Party and the Soviet government, confirming the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, the propaganda of the ideas of Soviet patriotism and the friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union—all these should occupy a leading position in this work. More lectures should be held to expose the conspiracies of imperialism and the decadence of bourgeois culture, and more broadly and vividly demonstrate the growth of the strength of the anti-imperialist democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and publicize the life and achievements of people's democratic countries and the upsurge of the international workers' movement. We must unswervingly improve the ideological level of public speaking, and every lecture should be militant and imbued with the spirit of fighting Bolshevik Party spirit.

Let us expand the scale of propaganda of political and scientific knowledge and improve the ideological level of political and scientific knowledge!

    政治的和科学的知识到群众中去
    苏维埃社会充满信心地沿着走向共产主义的道路迈进，苏联人民的社会主义觉悟程度及文化水平日益生长和提高着。我们的党成功地完成着共产主义建设事业的重要任务之一——即使一切工人和农民成为有文化和有教养的人，并使工人阶级的文化技术水平提高到工程师的技术水平。
    斯大林同志指出：“只有工人阶级的这样高度的文化技术，才能够打破智力劳动和体力劳动之间的对立基础，才能够保证从社会主义过渡到共产主义所必需的那样高的劳动生产力和充足的日用品。
    为了提前完成战后五年计划的大规模的社会主义竞赛，鲜明地反映了苏联工人阶级文化技术水平的提高。在劳动中表现了创造性的带头作用，千百万的生产革新者，他们是先进的，有高度觉悟程度的人们，他们是为改善技术而斗争的积极的参加者。集体农庄从自己的庄员中不断地提拔出成千的农业先进者和社会主义的劳动英雄们。
    人民大众文化水平的继续提高和共产主义的教育，是成功地完成共产主义建设任务的重要条件之一。劳动者们的社会主义觉悟水平愈高，那么他们的政治积极性和劳动积极性就愈强。这就是为什么党对于劳动者的共产主义教育问题和政治科学知识的宣传给予这样地重视。
    公开讲演宣传在劳动者的共产主义教育工作中占有显要的地位。近年来在公开讲演宣传的组织上党的组织获得了显著的改善。各加盟共和国的党中央，边区委会，州委会及市委会的各讲演组都加强了自己的活动。开始更多的做有关理论和党史的讲演，全苏普及政治科学知识协会正进行着巨大的工作。两年以来该协会的会员们作了两万次以上的讲演，听讲的劳动群众有数千万之多。
    但是公开讲演宣传的范围以及讲演的政治思想水平（主要的）还没有满足党所提出的高度的要求，直到现在为止公开讲演宣传多是在大城市里举行——是在边区的、州的、和共和国的大的中心城市里。
    特别迫切的问题——必须彻底改善乡村的政治和科学知识的宣传问题。集体农庄的面貌已全然改变了，集体农庄员的精神食粮的要求不断地增长着，农业文化也在提高着，许多农村区已经完成了全面的电气化和无线电化，而其他农村区也正向着这个方向前进。苏维埃国家正在日益扩大的规模上用最新的技术去武装社会主义的农业。这一切不能不加强——实际上已经加强了——集体农庄员的，拖拉机站和苏维埃农场工人的对知识和文化的渴望，但是这种不断增长着的乡村劳动者的精神食粮的要求，在公开讲演宣传里却时常被忽略了。
    而且为了组织广泛的关于列宁斯大林思想的和苏维埃科学文化成就的公开讲演宣传，我们是有一切条件的。苏维埃知识分子的队伍拥有千百万各种科学专家，他们都能根据自己不同的知识来做专门的讲演。在国家的任何农村区里都有数十个教员，农业专家，医生和其他的专家们在那里工作。
    在许多共和国边区，州内的党的组织，吸收了乡村知识分子去参加公开讲演工作，这些地方的政治科学知识的宣传也正常地进行着。建立了数百个公开讲演的组织，这里边有好几千讲演的科学家参加工作。但是以全国范围说公开讲演宣传工作还只是吸收了我们巨大文化力量的极其微小的一部分，在全苏政治科学知识普及协会里一共只有四万正式会员和两万候补会员。对劳动者的参加共产主义的教育事业是每一个苏维埃知识分子的爱国义务。
    无疑地，苏维埃知识分子的最广大阶层都有充足的准备和希望去参加公开讲演宣传工作。只是需要党的组织，全苏政治科学知识普及协会和文教机关的委员会去善于吸收我们的知识分子来参加这个重要的光荣的工作，对讲演者的经常工作，对他们领导——首先就是公开讲演宣传的范围及其政治思想水平，因此，为数颇多的讲演科学家干部们应该以布尔什维克要求的精神来教育自己——高度的思想性，密切的生活联系，具体性，政治目的的要求等。
    质量和思想内容，这就是群众的政治科学教育工作的主要的东西。在公开讲演的实际工作中，还存在有严重的缺点，很多的讲演水平是很低的，时常讲一些无聊的滥调，与经济文化建设的具体任务很少联系，对自然科学的知识的宣传及与那些偏见和胡诌的斗争注意的不够。有一些讲演的严重缺点是：语言枯燥无味，词不达意，有时使人难以理解，讲演者不善于提起听众对讲演的兴趣。
    凡一切从事政治科学知识宣传的国家的和社会的组织、党的组织必须改善对他们的领导，时常纠正和检查公开讲演的工作。
    列宁、斯大林的战无不胜的思想的宣传，党的和苏维埃政府的重要措施的解释，证实社会主义制度优越于资本主义制度，宣传苏维埃爱国主义的思想和苏联各民族的友谊，所有这些应该在这件工作中占领导地位。应该多举行揭露帝国主义阴谋和资产阶级文化的颓废，以及腐朽的讲演，同时更广泛地和更鲜明地表现以苏联为首的反帝国主义的民主阵营力量的增长，宣传人民民主国家的生活和成绩及国际工人运动的高涨，必须坚定不移地提高公开讲演的思想水平，每一个讲演都应该是战斗性的，和贯穿了战斗的布尔什维克党性的精神。
    让我们扩大宣传政治科学知识的规模和提高政治科学知识的思想水平吧！
