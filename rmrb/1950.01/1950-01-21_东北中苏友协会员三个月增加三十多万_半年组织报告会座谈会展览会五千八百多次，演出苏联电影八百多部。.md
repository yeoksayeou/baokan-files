Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th—The Northeast China-Soviet Friendship Association branches in various locations have actively expanded their work, with membership now exceeding 800,000. The Northeast China-Soviet Friendship Association General Branch currently oversees the provincial branches in Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, Rehe, and Heilongjiang, as well as the directly subordinate municipal branches in Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, and Benxi, and the Dalian area branch. Branch and sub-branch organizations have also been established in other small and medium-sized cities. According to incomplete statistics from the beginning of this month, there are a total of 124 city and county branches under the leadership of the provincial branches, 441 sub-branches under the four directly subordinate municipal branches, and a total of 2,385 branch and sub-branch organizations across the five provinces and one area. The total number of members in various locations is 802,700, an increase of more than one-half compared to the 500,000 in September.

In order to strengthen the promotion of China-Soviet friendship and introduce Soviet construction experience, the Northeast China-Soviet Friendship Association branches have actively carried out various activities. In the past six months, a total of 5,830 reports, seminars, and exhibitions have been organized, with the participation of over 2,415,000 people. 839 Soviet films have been shown (counting each film as one unit, including repeated showings). In addition, weekly lectures and music and dance performances have been held. In total, more than 5,670,000 people have participated in these activities. These activities have greatly enhanced the masses' understanding of the Soviet Union, thereby consolidating the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union.

In order to systematically introduce Soviet construction experience and regularly exchange work experience among the local friendship associations, the Northeast Friendship Association General Branch now publishes the "Introduction to the Soviet Union" magazine and the "China-Soviet Friendship" newspaper.

Among the Northeast China-Soviet Friendship Association branches in various locations, the Dalian and Harbin branches have the longest history, with four years of existence. The Dalian branch has reached more than 247,000 members, while the Harbin branch has 104,000 members. In addition, the Shenyang branch has reached more than 130,000 members. Among the 36,400 members in the Rehe branch, farmers account for half. This is the result of the Soviet epidemic prevention team's enthusiastic assistance to the people of Rehe in eradicating the plague, which gave the farmers of Rehe a deeper understanding of the Soviet Union.

To ensure the success of the China-Soviet Friendship Association's work, it is necessary to combine it with the central work of various departments and strengthen organizational leadership.

Over the past year, the experience of Dalian and Liaodong and other places has proven that the work of the China-Soviet Friendship Association can only have concrete content and establish close ties with various local mass organizations if it proactively combines with the central work of various departments, and only by carrying out work through these mass organizations can the work of the China-Soviet Friendship Association easily become a mass activity. Secondly, the work experience in various places has proven that to ensure the success of the China-Soviet Friendship Association's work, it is necessary to strengthen organizational leadership, maintain close contact between upper and lower levels, and help grassroots organizations promote their work. According to the experience of Dalian and Shenyang, regularly holding amateur training courses to cultivate and solve the problems of grassroots organization cadres and active members, so as to strengthen publicity and education for members through them, is not only beneficial for cultivating cadres and exchanging experiences, but also a good way to maintain close organizational ties between upper and lower levels.

Regarding the work guidelines of the China-Soviet Friendship Association in 1950, the Northeast General Branch has decided to develop membership on the basis of consolidating and rectifying existing organizations, strengthen organizational leadership, and establish organizations and develop membership in a planned and focused manner in areas where organizations have not yet been established, and appropriately utilize the agricultural slack season to carry out work in rural areas.

    东北中苏友协会员三个月增加三十多万
    半年组织报告会座谈会展览会五千八百多次，演出苏联电影八百多部。
    【新华社沈阳二十日电】东北各地中苏友好协会积极展开工作，会员已发展至八十万余人。东北中苏友好协会总分会现辖有辽东、辽西、吉林、热河、黑龙江五个省分会，沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、本溪四直属市分会，及旅大地区分会。其他各中小城市亦已建立了分、支会组织。据本月初不完全统计，各省分会领导下共有一百二十四个市、县分支会，四直属市分会下辖支会四百四十一个，五省一地区的支分会则共有二千三百八十五个。各地共拥有会员八十万二千七百余人，较九月份的五十万人增加了二分之一以上。
    为了加强中苏友好的宣传与介绍苏联建设经验，东北各地中苏友好协会分支会曾积极进行了各种活动。半年来共组织了报告会、座谈会及展览会五千八百三十次，参加人数达二百四十一万五千多人。演出苏联影片八百三十九部（以一片作一部算，其中包括重复演出）。此外，并曾举行星期讲座及音乐舞蹈会等。总计参加这些活动的群众共有五百六十七万多人。通过这些活动大大提高了群众对苏联的认识，从而巩固了中苏两国人民的友谊。
    为了系统地介绍苏联建设经验，和经常交流各地友协工作经验，东北友协总分会现出版有《苏联介绍》杂志及《中苏友好》报纸。
    东北各地中苏友好协会分会中，以旅大及哈尔滨两地分会历史最久，已有四年历史。旅大分会的会员已达二十四万七千余人，哈尔滨市分会会员则有十万四千人。此外，沈阳分会会员则已达十三万多人。热河分会三万六千四百余会员中，农民即占一半。这是苏联防疫队热心协助热河人民扑灭鼠疫，热河农民对苏联有了更深刻的认识的结果。
    要使中苏友协工作做好，必须结合各部门中心工作并加强组织领导。
    一年来，旅大及辽东等地的经验证明：中苏友好协会工作只有主动地结合各部门的中心工作，才有具体内容，才能使友好协会与当地各种群众团体密切联系起来，通过这些群众团体来展开工作，才易于使中苏友好协会工作成为群众性的活动。其次，各地工作经验证明，要使中苏友好协会工作做好，必须加强组织领导，密切上下联系，帮助下层组织推动工作。根据旅大地区和沈阳市的经验，经常举办业余训练班培养和解决基层组织干部和积极会员，以便通过他们去加强对会员的宣传教育，这种办法不仅对培养干部交流经验有好处，而且是密切上下组织联系的好方法。
    关于一九五○年中苏友好协会工作方针，东北总分会已决定在整顿与巩固现有组织的基础上发展会员，加强组织领导工作，在未建立组织的地方，有计划地有重点地建立组织和发展会员，并适当利用农闲时期，在农村中开展工作。
