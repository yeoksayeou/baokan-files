The history of the Zhongxing Coal Mine vividly illustrates how Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries oppressed and exploited Chinese national industry and commerce, and how the People's Government protects and supports Chinese national industry and commerce.

The Zhongxing Coal Mine is part of the business of Pingxing Industrial Co., Ltd., founded by Wang Ziwen, Zhu Qing, and others in 1935. The mine's equipment was the most complete among the private coal mines in Mentougou, using all-electric mining with five winches. Underground, there were light railways, and the mine employed over 700 workers. The highest annual output could reach 60,000 tons.

During the period of Japanese occupation, in addition to suffering unreasonable exploitation, the Japanese, seeing the mine's relatively large scale, attempted to seize it forcibly. In the winter of 1944, a Japanese ruffian named Shiratori demanded cooperation. After the mine refused, the Japanese military police arrested Wang Ziwen and Zhu Qing on charges of "resisting Japan" and "colluding with the Eighth Route Army." The Japanese immediately forcibly confiscated the mine. It was not returned until August 12, 1945, shortly before the Japanese surrender. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Zhongxing Coal Mine, like all national industries and businesses, was subjected to heavy exploitation. There were as many as thirty kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies, making it difficult to develop. The Kuomintang had seventy-two agencies in the Mentougou town, and each agency came to the coal mine to plunder and seize, forcibly purchasing coal at low prices. Secret agents and military police even robbed coal at gunpoint. In addition, Kuomintang reactionary bureaucrats used their privileges to open small kilns indiscriminately in the Mentougou mining area, damaging mineral deposits and hindering legitimate mining, further reducing the mine to a state of near death. Last year, the Kuomintang reactionaries' "August 19th" price control order caused the mine to be brutally plundered, losing no less than 4,000 tons of coal. On the eve of liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries frantically conscripted soldiers, assigning the mine to "provide" ten soldiers. The mine used five or six million yuan in counterfeit currency, borrowed to pay wages, to offset the conscription quota. When Mentougou was liberated, the company's manager, engineers, coal experts, and administrative director, deceived by Kuomintang reactionary propaganda and unaware of the People's Government's policy of protecting national industry and commerce, all fled the mine. To ensure the livelihood of the workers and continue production, the Military Control Commission decided to implement trusteeship.

During the eleven-month period of trusteeship, the government made its utmost efforts to gradually revive and develop the mine from its moribund state. In the early days of liberation, coal production was difficult to sell. The mine sold only twenty-odd tons per day, which was not enough to cover expenses. The Coal and Iron Company provided assistance through coal-for-grain exchanges and bulk purchases. By June, it had assisted in selling approximately 30,000 tons of coal in fifteen separate instances. In mid-June, the People's Bank also placed an order for 8,000 tons of coal through a fixed-order loan arrangement, resolving the sales problem. During the rainy season this summer, the mine was flooded and production stopped, making it impossible to pay wages. The state-owned Jingxi Coal Mine Company provided loans three times, totaling over 30 million yuan. These assistance measures enabled the mine to circulate funds, expand production tools, pay wages, and repay debts of over 2,000 tons of coal owed before liberation. Before the rainy season flood, daily output had increased from over 150 tons to over 300 tons. In terms of business management, the government's trusteeship committee largely maintained the original system, but also made many necessary reforms, such as streamlining unnecessary personnel, increasing the number of technical workers, and establishing a budget system. During the trusteeship period, as a result of expanded production, necessary equipment was added and purchased, totaling approximately 94,000 jin of millet in value. Investments were also made in the Dong Yu Ji and Wen Xing Ji kilns, valued at approximately 189,900 jin of millet. In addition, workers' welfare problems were appropriately resolved, such as building bathhouses, organizing cooperatives, and improving medical equipment. The mine was officially returned to the original owners for operation on January 16, and the handover took place immediately. Zhu Qing, associate manager of the original owner, Pingxing Industrial Co., Ltd., said: "Under the wise policy of the government to encourage the development of industry and mining, the Zhongxing Coal Mine has been placed under trusteeship and supported. We are extremely admired and grateful. In the future, we are still willing to work hard to increase production under the leadership of the government."

    中兴煤矿是人民政府从垂死中救活的
    人民政府保护私营工商业
    中兴煤矿的历史，鲜明的写出了日本帝国主义和国民党反动派怎样压迫榨取中国民族工商业，人民政府又怎样保护扶植中国民族工商业。
    中兴煤矿是平兴实业股份有限公司业务之一，由王子文、朱?青等于一九三五年创办。该矿的设备，在门头沟私营煤窑中最为完善，全部用电力开采，有五部绞车。井下设轻便铁道，矿工有七百余人。产量每年最高可达六万吨。
    日寇统治时期，该矿除遭受无理榨取外，日寇因视该矿稍具规模，企图强占，日本浪人白鸟于一九四四年冬要求合作，经该矿拒绝，日寇宪兵即以“抗日”、“通八路”罪名逮捕了王子文和朱?青，日寇当即强行没收该矿。至一九四五年八月十二日日寇投降前夕才发还。国民党反动统治时，中兴煤矿和一切民族工商业没有例外地遭受到重重压榨，苛捐杂税达三十几种，负担累累，势难发展，而国民党在门头沟市镇设有七十二个机关，每一机关都到煤矿上掠取劫夺，以低价强购，特务、宪兵甚至持枪抢煤。此外，再加上国民党反动官僚利用特权在门头沟矿区滥开小窑，损毁矿藏，妨害正当开采，该矿更陷于奄奄一息。去年国民党反动派“八一九”限价，该矿又受到残酷掠夺，损失煤不下四千吨。解放前夕，国民党反动派疯狂征兵，派该矿“出兵”十名，该矿把借来准备发工资的五、六万元伪币抵交了征兵摊派。门头沟解放时，该公司经理、工程师、煤师以及事务主任等人，因受国民党反动宣传的欺骗，不了解人民政府保护民族工商业的政策，都逃离该矿。军管会为照顾工人生活并继续生产，乃决定实行代管。
    代管期间共十一个月，政府尽了最大的努力使该矿从垂死状态中渐渐苏生、发展。解放初期煤产推销困难，该矿仅日销二十几吨，不够开支，煤铁公司用以煤易粮及批购等方式予以扶助，到六月止先后十五次共协助销煤约三万余吨。六月中旬，人民银行又以定货贷款办法订购煤八千吨，解决了销路问题。今夏雨季时，雨水浸窑停止生产，发不出工资，公营京西煤矿公司复贷款扶助，先后三次共贷给三千余万元。由于这些扶助，使该矿周转了资金，扩充生产工具，支付工资，并偿还了解放前欠债二千余吨煤。雨季淹窑以前，已由日产量一百五十余吨增到三百余吨。在经营管理方面，政府代管委员大体上保持原有制度，但对精简不必要的冗员，增加技术工人，建立预算制度等也做了许多必要的改革。代管期中，由于扩大生产的结果，添置购买了必要的器材，总数约值九万四千余斤小米，并向东毓记、文兴记两窑投资，约值小米十八万九千九百余斤。此外，还适当地解决了工人福利问题，如兴建澡堂、组织合作社、改进医疗设备等。该矿已于一月十六日正式发还原业主经营，即日进行点交。原业主平兴实业公司协理朱?青说：“政府在鼓励开发工矿的英明政策下，代管并扶植了中兴煤矿，我们是万分钦佩和感激的，今后仍愿在政府领导下，努力提高生产”。
