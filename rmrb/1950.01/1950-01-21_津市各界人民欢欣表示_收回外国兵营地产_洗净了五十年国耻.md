    Tianjin People From All Walks of Life Joyfully Express:
    Recovering Foreign Barracks Land
    Washing Away Fifty Years of National Humiliation
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] People from all walks of life in Tianjin unanimously support the Beijing Military Control Commission's action to recover the land of the former barracks of the United States, France, and the Netherlands, and to requisition the barracks on the land. People from all walks of life in Tianjin have also expressed their support for the Beijing Military Control Commission's recovery of the barracks land of the United States, France, and the Netherlands. Huang Huoqing, Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions, said: "The Beijing Military Control Commission's recovery of the former barracks land of the United States, France, and the Netherlands is a glory in the history of Chinese diplomacy and a glory for the Chinese people! Facts prove that only under the leadership of the Central People's Government, which truly represents the interests of the Chinese people, can the Chinese nation achieve complete liberation and independence." Workers, technicians, engineers, and others from various factories have expressed their views, unanimously supporting this measure by the Beijing Military Control Commission. Shao Jizong, a technician at Zhongfang No. 3 Factory, said: The Beijing Military Control Commission's recovery of the former barracks land of the United States, France, and the Netherlands is entirely in line with the interests and aspirations of the Chinese people. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China will not only recover the barracks land but also abolish all unequal treaties and aggressive privileges of imperialism in China. He Qijun, Chairman of the Tianjin Youth Federation, said: Tianjin youth fully support this patriotic measure to safeguard national sovereignty. We must fight to the end to completely abolish all unequal treaties and aggressive privileges created by imperialism in China! Luo Yun, Director of the Municipal Women's Federation, said: The U.S. State Department wants to use unequal treaties to intimidate the independent and autonomous Chinese people, but who is afraid of this? The Chinese people will always handle their own affairs in accordance with the principle of independence and autonomy. Bi Mingqi, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Manager of Hua Shen Trading Company, said: "From now on, the location of our country's capital will no longer have imperialist barracks. This nearly fifty years of national humiliation has been washed away from now on."
