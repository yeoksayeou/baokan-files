    Li Vice Minister Protests Thailand's Mistreatment of Overseas Chinese
    All Circles in the Capital Voice Support
    [Beijing News] People from all circles in the capital resolutely support the serious protest lodged by our country's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Li Kenong to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the previous (26th) regarding the Thai government's mistreatment and killing of overseas Chinese. Jin Meiling and Cao Tao yang, workers at the Xinhua Rubber Factory, stated that they demand the Thai government guarantee the fulfillment of the three conditions put forward by Vice Minister Li. They said, "We want to warn the Thai government that the Chinese people have stood up, and we absolutely cannot watch our compatriots suffer the mistreatment and killing by the Thai government!" Li Guorui, a worker at the Water Company, said, "When I saw the news in the newspaper about the Thai Phibunsongkhram government's mistreatment and killing of overseas Chinese, I was extremely angry! The Phibunsongkhram government cruelly persecutes overseas Chinese. Our government should lodge a serious protest to protect overseas Chinese from being killed by the Thai government." Professor Qian Duansheng of Tsinghua University said, "Vice Minister Li Kenong sent a telegram to the Thai reactionary government, protesting the persecution of our overseas compatriots, which expressed what all Chinese people wanted to say. The Thai government has been an imperialist pawn for the past forty years, using every possible means to mistreat overseas Chinese, especially the reactionary government headed by Phibunsongkhram, which is the most brutal and tyrannical. We resolutely demand that the Thai government immediately stop the atrocities of bullying overseas Chinese that have continued for decades." Lu Zhiwei, President of Yenching University, said, "The ruling class of Thailand has always colluded with imperialists to invade China for decades. The Thai government's anti-Chinese policy has been consistent, not accidental. Regarding the newly occurring anti-Chinese incidents, we should lodge a serious protest to the Thai reactionary government."

    李副部长抗议泰国虐待华侨
    首都各界齐声拥护
    【北京讯】首都各界人民坚决拥护我国外交部副部长李克农于前（二十六）日就泰国政府虐待和杀害华侨问题向泰国外交部所提出的严重抗议。新华橡胶厂工人金美玲和曹涛扬表示，要求泰国政府保证履行李副部长所提出的三个条件，他们说：“我们要警告泰国政府，中国人民已经站起来了，我们绝不能看着我们的同胞遭受泰国政府的虐待和杀害！”自来水公司工人李国瑞说：“我看见报上登了泰国銮披汶政府虐待和杀害华侨的消息，真是愤恨极了！銮披汶政府凶残迫害华侨，我国政府应当提出严重的抗议，保护华侨不再受泰国政府的杀害。”清华大学钱端升教授说：“李克农副部长致电泰国反动政府，抗议迫害我侨胞，是说出了全中国人民要说的话。泰国政府四十年来一直是帝国主义的爪牙，虐待华侨无所不用其极，尤以銮披汶为首的反动政府最为凶残蛮横，我们坚决要求泰国政府立即停止几十年来继续不断的欺侮华侨的暴行。”燕京大学校长陆志韦说：“泰国的统治阶级，几十年来老是勾结帝国主义者来侵略中国，泰国政府的排华政策是一贯的，不是偶然的，对于新发生的排华事件，我们应当向泰国反动政府提出严重的抗议”。
