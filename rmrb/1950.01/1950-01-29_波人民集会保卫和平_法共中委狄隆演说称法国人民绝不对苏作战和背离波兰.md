The slogans of the rally were: "The camp of peace and progress headed by the Soviet Union will be victorious!" "Long live the friendship between the working masses of Poland and France in the struggle for peace!"

    Franciszek, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, strongly condemned the French police for using Hitler's methods at the meeting; and paid tribute to the Polish brothers in France who are fighting against Moke's (referring to the French Minister of the Interior) terrorist acts, and to the French friends who oppose French and American imperialism.

    Gada, Chairman of the French Committee for the Protection of Foreign Nationals, said in his speech: "Democratic France and workers' organizations firmly condemn the shameful policies of the French government." Dillon, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, said: "The French people will never participate in a war against the leader of international peace forces—the Soviet Union. The French people will never allow themselves to betray the people's Poland."
