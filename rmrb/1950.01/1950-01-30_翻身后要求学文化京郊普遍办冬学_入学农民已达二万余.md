    After Emancipation, Peasants Demand Education; Winter Schools Are Commonly Established in the Suburbs of Beijing; Enrollment of Peasants Reaches Over 20,000
    [Beijing News] Winter school work is being widely carried out in the suburbs of Beijing. Due to the increased awareness of peasants during the land reform, they urgently demand cultural learning. Winter schools have been established in most villages in the suburbs, with a total of 473 classes and 20,123 participants. Generally, each village first establishes a winter school committee composed of the work team, farmers' association, village government, and primary school to promote the work. Teachers are appointed by the local primary school teachers. Some villages also implement the "little teacher" system. Villages such as Xiba in the East Suburb have also established winter school teaching and guiding committees, with teachers meeting once a week to discuss teaching materials, teaching methods, and problems existing in learning. Some villages have established various systems such as roll call, leave of absence, and meetings according to the actual situation, so that learning is on the right track. The winter school curriculum mainly focuses on current affairs, politics, Chinese language, and arithmetic, with recreational activities in addition to learning. The peasants participating in the winter schools are extremely enthusiastic. In villages such as Xiba, Yaojiayuan, and Guanzhuang in the East Suburb, the peasants still have to extend the class for more than ten minutes after the bell rings before leaving. Zhang Yuru from Dayu Village in Mentougou is not only active in learning but also helps the women in the same courtyard and her own husband to learn. So far, the winter school has achieved preliminary results. In the Guanzhuang Winter School in the East Suburb, students can generally recognize four to five hundred characters, and the best can recognize about a thousand characters, and can write slips, keep accounts, and write simple letters. In Huai Fang Village in the South Suburb, each person can recognize an average of one to two hundred characters. Kang Chang from Liujia Village in Fengtai District said: "After listening to the political class, I realized that the Soviet Union is our true good friend, and American imperialism is our enemy." The current problems in winter school work in the suburbs are: individual villages have the phenomenon of disguised coercion; primary school teachers are also excessively tired. For example, when the youth committee of Pingfang Village in the East Suburb mobilized peasants to participate in winter school, they said: "Each farmers' association group must have someone come." The teachers in the village have to run more than two miles to teach winter school every night and do not return home for dinner until after 9 o'clock, with very little time to rest.

    翻身后要求学文化京郊普遍办冬学
    入学农民已达二万余
    【北京讯】京市郊区广泛开展冬学工作。由于土地改革中农民觉悟的提高，迫切要求文化学习，郊区大部村庄都开办了冬学，共成立四百七十三班，有二万零一百二十三人参加学习。各村一般的是首先由工作组、农会、村政府、小学校等单位组成冬学委员会，推进工作，教员由各该村小学教员担任。有些村庄并实行“小先生”制。东郊西坝等村还成立了冬学教导委员会，教员每周开会一次，研讨教材、教学法及学习中所存在的问题。有些村庄根据实际情况，建立了点名、请假、会议等各种制度，使学习步入正规。冬学课程，都以时事、政治、国文、算术为主，在学习外并有文娱活动。参加冬学的农民，情绪极为高涨。东郊西坝、姚家园、官庄等村，打了下课铃，农民还得延长十几分钟才走。门头沟大峪村张玉儒，不但学习积极，还帮助同院妇女和自己的男人学习。截至目前为止，冬学已获得了初步成绩。东郊官庄冬学中，学员一般都能认识四、五百字，最好的已能认识一千字左右，会开条子、记账、写简单的信。南郊槐房村平均每人能认识一、二百字。丰台区刘家村康长说：“我听完政治课，才明白了苏联是我们真正的好朋友，美帝国主义是我们的敌人。”郊区冬学工作目前存在着的问题是：个别村庄有变相强迫命令的现象；小学教师也过度的疲劳，如东郊平房村青年委员发动农民参加冬学时说：“每个农会小组都必须有人来。”该村教员每晚跑二里多地去教冬学，九点多钟才回家吃饭，很少有休息的时间。
