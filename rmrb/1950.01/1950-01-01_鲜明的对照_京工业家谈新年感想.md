Sharp Contrast

Beijing Industrialists Talk About New Year's Feelings

The industrialists of the capital are joyfully welcoming the first victorious New Year since the birth of the new China. This time last year, it was when the Kuomintang reactionary troops were retreating into the city and suburbs. National industries, long oppressed by imperialism and Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, were already on the verge of bankruptcy. In addition, the reactionary troops wantonly destroyed them. Private factories were forced to stop work one after another. The machines, factory buildings, and buildings of several factories were tragically burned, and raw materials were looted. After liberation, with the encouragement and vigorous support of the People's Government, private factories gradually recovered, and many factories have made significant progress. The lives of workers have also improved. This New Year, when industrialists recall the New Year scene last year, they are full of emotion. Song Huaru, manager of Ci Xing Iron Factory, said: "Last New Year was simply a dead year. Production was completely stopped. The foundry workshop became a stable. War horses were tied to the boiler. Only eight workers were left. This year, we can develop a factory that was badly damaged by the reactionary army to this level. Looking back, it's like a world away. The power of the workers is really great! We will celebrate the New Year well this year." Ci Xing is considered the largest private iron factory in Beijing. Now the number of employees has increased from eight before liberation to more than 160. In this stage after liberation, production has been developing day by day. The main work is to process for state-owned enterprises, such as manufacturing waterwheels for the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Agency, and casting boilers for the Ministry of Railways, accounting for about three-quarters of the total production. Therefore, it can carry out production in a planned way. In 1950, it will continue to cast iron pipes for the Ministry of Railways and the Water Company, and prepare to manufacture electrical appliances for the North China Electric Power Company, cooperating with the government's construction work and processing for state-owned enterprises. Chen Yintang, general manager of Dahua Pottery Company, said gratefully to the reporter: "Last year before the New Year, the factory was ruined by the 'army'. The kiln was destroyed, and the bowl boards and wooden frames were burned by the bandit army as firewood. Livestock were fed in the factory buildings. Lacking this and lacking that, it didn't look like a factory at all. At that time, our economic situation was not enough to start work, and we didn't even have money to buy pickles! After the liberation of Beiping, the People's Government provided us with loans and support twice, and Dahua was able to achieve today's production scale." Dahua Pottery Company is the only porcelain factory in Beijing and Tianjin. In the ten months after liberation, it shipped 2.5 million pieces (530,000 pieces in nine months in 1948), an increase of more than four times compared with the production volume in 1948. The number of employees increased from more than 80 to 210, and 44 new houses were built, three machines were added, and one kiln was built. The equipment is becoming more and more perfect. In order to cooperate with national construction, in 1950, part of its strength will be shifted to manufacture building materials and accept the production of electrical porcelain (batteries, porcelain tubes, etc.). Pu Jiexiu, general manager of Zhenbei Leather Company, said happily: "Last year, when celebrating the New Year, I was nervous, and this year I am still nervous, but last year I was nervous about protecting the factory, but this year I am nervous about production. Zhenbei Leather Company has been established for nearly three years, and it has never been so busy with production as this year. In July, it received a loan from the People's Bank, and in September, it accepted the order for leather surfaces from the military region, and production became even more tense." Now the number of employees in Zhenbei Leather Factory has increased from more than 40 before liberation to more than 70, and equipment for manufacturing finished products has been added. Fu Huating, manager of Weiyi Flour Mill, said: "Last New Year, we were busy dismantling and transporting machines. Even so, several machines, flour passages, pipes, etc. that were not dismantled in time were destroyed by the reactionary troops. All things with wood were burned. This year, our factory has not only recovered, but also developed day by day, and is now planning to expand production further." Weiyi Flour Mill started sorting on February 9th after liberation, and officially resumed work on March 1st. By the end of March, it was processing wheat flour for the Grain Company, and the problem of raw material sales was completely solved. Therefore, the production in April reached 22,000 bags, an increase of 9,000 bags compared with March. The output increased month by month thereafter, and the production volume in October reached 36,000 bags. It is now planned to build a warehouse that can hold 40,000 bags of flour, six flour mills, two wheat roasters, and lengthen the small railway around the factory.

In the eleven months after liberation, national industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have been restored and developed, and have gradually embarked on the correct path of processing for state-owned enterprises. The victorious year has arrived, and all private factories are celebrating with joy.

    鲜明的对照
    京工业家谈新年感想
    首都工业家正欢欣地迎接新中国诞生后第一个胜利新年。去年今日，正是国民党反动军队撤退到城内和城郊的时候，久经帝国主义和国民党官僚资本压迫的民族工业，本已临于破产的边缘，又加以反动军队的恣意破坏，各私营工厂相继被迫停工，若干工厂的机器，厂房，建筑惨遭焚毁，原料也被抢掠一空。解放以后，在人民政府奖励和大力扶植下，各私营工厂才逐渐地恢复起来，许多工厂并已有了显著的发展，工人生活也得到了改善，工业家们在今年的新年，回想去年过年的情景，都十分感慨。慈型铁工厂经理宋化如说：“去年新年简直是一个死年，生产完全停顿了，翻砂厂房变成了马号，锅炉上拴着战马，工人只剩了八个人，今年我们能把一个被反动军队破坏不堪的厂子，发展到这个样子，回想起来，恍如隔世，工人的力量真伟大啊！今年新年我们要好好的庆祝。”慈型在北京私营铁工厂里算是最大的一家，现在已经由解放前的八个工人增加到一百六十多个职工，解放后的这一阶段，生产日渐发展，主要工作是给国营企业加工，如给华北水利推进社制造水车，给铁道部铸造锅炉等，约占总生产的四分之三，因之能有计划地进行生产，一九五○年将继续给铁道部和自来水公司铸造铁管，并准备给华北电业公司制造电器品。配合政府的建设工作，为国营企业加工。大华窑业公司总经理陈荫棠感激地对记者说：“去年前过年，厂子被‘军队’糟塌的一塌糊涂，窑被破坏了，碗板子，木架子都被匪军当柴火烧了，厂房里喂上牲畜，缺这个，少那个，根本不像是一个工厂了，那时我们的经济状况别说是开工，连买咸菜的钱都没有！北平解放了，人民政府两次对我们贷款扶植，大华才有了今天的生产规模。”大华窑业公司是京津唯一的制造瓷器工厂，解放后的十个月中共出货二百五十万个（一九四八年九个月出货五十三万个）较一九四八年生产量增加四倍多，职工由八十多人增加到二百一十人，并新建房子四十四间，增添机器三台，窑一座，设备日臻完善，为了配合国家建设，一九五○年将移一部力量制造建筑材料并接受电瓷（电瓶，瓷管等）加工的生产。振北制革公司总经理浦洁修愉快地说：“去年过年的时候心情紧张，今年新年仍然紧张，但是去年紧张着护厂，今年却紧张着搞生产。振北制革公司成立将近三年，从没有像今年这样紧张地进行生产，七月间得到人民银行扶植贷款，九月间接受了军区的皮面皮的订货，生产就更加紧张起来。”现在振北制革厂的职工已由解放前的四十多人增加到七十多人，并且增添了制造成品的设备。唯一面粉厂经理傅华亭说：“去年新年我们一心忙着拆运机器，就这样，没有来得及拆运的几部机器，面道，管子等还都被反动军队破坏了，凡是带木头的东西都被烧掉了，今年我们的工厂不但恢复，而且一天天地发展，现在正计划着再扩大生产。”唯一面粉厂在解放后二月九日开工整理，三月一日正式复工，到三月下旬给粮食公司加工小麦磨粉，原料销路问题全告解决，因之四月份生产达二万二千袋，较三月份增加九千袋，以后产量逐月增加，十月份生产量已达三万六千袋。现正拟增建能容四万袋面的仓库一座，六部磨粉机，两部烤麦机，并加长环厂的小铁道。
    解放后十一个月来，有利国计民生的民族工业都获得了恢复与发展，并逐渐走上为国营企业加工的正确道路，胜利年到了，各私营工厂都在欢天喜地地庆祝。
