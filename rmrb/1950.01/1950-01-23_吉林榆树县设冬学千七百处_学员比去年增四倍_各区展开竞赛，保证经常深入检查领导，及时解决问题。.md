    [This newspaper's Jilin dispatch] Yushu County has established 1,748 winter schools, with 137,338 students, accounting for 21 percent of the county's 650,000 population. Among the students, Communist Party members, Youth League members, and organized young men and women account for three-quarters. Winter schools in various places have generally established study groups and "kang-head" groups, and set up literacy boards. The students enthusiastically made small blackboards. The 1,919 trained winter school teachers and the 2,603 "little teachers" who assist winter school teachers are playing an active role in winter schools everywhere. In order to run the winter schools well, various winter schools have launched a mutual competition and a movement to strive for learning models. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the masses is very high, and the number of winter school students has quadrupled compared to last year. Those who were illiterate in the past have now learned at least 50 characters or more. Huang Jingfang of Xinglong Village in the Ring City District has learned 200 characters from being illiterate and has also learned to sing the national anthem.
    The following problems still exist in the winter school movement: (1) Some village and township cadres only know how to mobilize others to attend winter school, using the excuse of being busy with work to avoid attending winter school themselves. Some cadres even send their daughters and daughters-in-law to relatives in other villages. As a result, the masses are unhappy. (2) Some people are perfunctory in their studies, feeling that it is just a winter thing; others are afraid of delaying work and are not at ease in their studies. (3) Some village cadres do not mobilize well, using fines for lamp oil to force people to attend school. In order to correct these phenomena, various districts are putting forward competitions, guaranteeing that they will always pay attention to leading winter school work, regularly conduct in-depth inspections; and pay attention to the combination of winter school and winter production, so as to prepare conditions for the great production next year.

    吉林榆树县设冬学千七百处
    学员比去年增四倍
    各区展开竞赛，保证经常深入检查领导，及时解决问题。
    【本报吉林通讯】榆树县已建立冬学一千七百四十八处，学员达十三万七千三百三十八名，占全县六十五万人口的百分之二十一。学员中共产党员、青年团员和有组织的青壮年男女占四分之三。各地冬学普遍成立了学习小组和炕头小组，设立了识字牌，学员们又热情的做了小黑板。经过训练的一千九百十九名冬学教员和辅助冬学教员的二千六百零三名小先生，在各地冬学里起着积极作用。为了使冬学办好，各地冬学开展了互相竞赛和争取学习模范的运动。因此，群众情绪很高，比去年冬学学员增多了四倍。过去不识字的现在最少已认到五十个字以上，环城区兴隆村的黄景芳已由不识字学会了二百字，又学会了唱国歌。
    现在冬学运动里还存在着下列的问题：（一）有的村、屯干部只知道动员别人上冬学，自己借口工作忙不上冬学。有的干部甚至把自家的姑娘、媳妇送到别屯的亲戚家去。因此，群众不高兴。（二）有的人在学习时应付，觉得反正是一冬事；有的则怕误工不安心学习。（三）有的村干部不好好动员，用罚灯油来强迫上学。为了纠正这些现象，各区正在提出竞赛，保证时时注意领导冬学工作，经常深入检查；并注意冬学与冬季生产结合，给明年大生产准备好条件。
