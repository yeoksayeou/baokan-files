    The Crisis of the United Nations
    He Sijing
    Recently, in the United Nations Security Council and other various bodies, a very sharp dispute has occurred between the representatives of socialist countries and the representatives of imperialist countries over the issue of Chinese representation. Due to the unreasonable support of the United States and other imperialist countries’ representatives for the pseudo-representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant bandits, the Soviet Union's representative and the representatives of the new democratic countries have successively withdrawn from various meetings of the United Nations organization. This event has shocked the world.
    The cause of the dispute is as follows:
    The Chinese people, with their revolutionary blood, overthrew the Kuomintang reactionary government and established the Central People's Government. It naturally has the right to decide its legal representative to attend the United Nations and its Security Council. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China acted according to its rights. Of course, procedurally, it should first deny the illegal representative, then decide its own legal representative, and then notify the United Nations accordingly. This is why Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, first issued a note to the United Nations on January 8, 1950, "requesting the United Nations and the Security Council to expel the illegal representatives of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionary remnant group," and then informed the United Nations on January 19 that the delegation headed by Zhang Wentian as the chief representative was the legitimate delegation of the People's Republic of China.
    The argument first arose in the Security Council over whether or not to expel the representatives of the reactionary remnant group, namely the illegal representatives. This issue was debated with very clear banners.
    The Soviet representative, a socialist country, first advocated the expulsion of the pseudo-representatives. The Soviet Union's just proposition was supported by the representatives of the new democratic countries and India.
    On the other hand, the US representative opposed the expulsion. France and other US puppets echoed the US’s opinions. Britain and Norway abstained, adopting a two-faced attitude.
    This dispute once again proved that the socialist country, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries are friends who help the Chinese people seek liberation and independence, while imperialism, especially US imperialism, is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. We can fully understand this by studying the arguments of both sides.
    The Soviet representative said: "The sole criterion for examining this issue (expelling the illegal representatives) and making a determination on this issue must be the will expressed by the government representing China and the Chinese people in international affairs as well as in relations with other countries. Such a government is the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China." The Soviet representative presented the telegram from this government as an expression of the government's will, and pointed out: "This telegram clearly states that the Kuomintang representative has been deprived of all power and has no right to remain in the Security Council."
    In this speech, the Soviet representative not only supported the interests of the Chinese people, but also supported the basic rights of all people struggling for their liberation, namely, that all oppressed nations and peoples have the right to revolution, the right to organize their own governments, and that this government has the right to deny all illegal representatives and send its own legal representatives.
    The Soviet representative's clear request to the Security Council to expel the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary group is a just action that fully conforms to the truth. If the Security Council wants to avoid making serious mistakes, it can only base its decision on objective truth, only on the objective fact that the main body of a country, namely the people, in the objective revolutionary process, overthrew a reactionary group, created its own central government, and that it has openly expressed and acted on the will of the people in international affairs and in relations with other countries. It cannot base such a decision on any subjective, selfish, and fabricated narratives. This is an extremely serious principle, which is related to the peace and security of all mankind, and also related to the nature of the United Nations and the Security Council. The United Nations and the Security Council are joint organizations of various countries. If they disregard the facts occurring within each nation and disregard the will of the people of each country, then this is being unfaithful to the principles of the United Nations and causing the United Nations to lose its foundation for existence.
    US imperialism wants to coerce the United Nations and change the principles of the United Nations. Let's see what the US representative said. He said: The United States "recognizes the government that authorized Jiang Tingfu to attend the Security Council." This means that the United States completely disregards the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and its expression of will. This proves the brutality and unreasonableness of US imperialism. This kind of unreasonable behavior not only attempts to deprive the Chinese people but also attempts to deprive all oppressed people of their revolutionary rights. According to the logic of US imperialists, the people of any country must not overthrow their reactionary government and organize their own government. Even if the revolution has been successful and their own central government has been formed, they cannot send their representatives to the United Nations! The reason why US imperialism must support the anti-people bandit groups of various countries, even after their demise, still insists on the spiritual tablet of their "legal government" is because doing so provides a "legal" tool to "legally" implement its vampire policy to enslave and plunder the people of various countries. However, this once again made the Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population, see through the ambition of US imperialism to trample on the rights of the Chinese people and the people of various countries and dominate the world.
    The US representative raped the Security Council and the United Nations! US imperialism forces the Security Council to make decisions not based on objective truth, but based on the aggressive policy of US imperialism. This is "oppression and tyranny" and "despotic and dictatorial rule" over the entire world.
    This arrogant behavior of US imperialism can only be: violating the entire Charter of the United Nations declared in the name of the people, violating the United Nations organization based on the principle of sovereign equality (Article 2), violating the purposes of the United Nations: 1. To maintain international peace and security…; 2. To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples…to promote universal peace (Article 1). If US imperialism is allowed to be so tyrannical, the United Nations and the United Nations Charter will be completely destroyed.
    The people of all countries should pay close attention to what is happening inside the United Nations and the Security Council. The Charter of the United Nations begins in the name of the people. If the people of all countries do not pay attention to what has happened in the United Nations and the Security Council to date, then someone will take advantage of the inattention of the people of all countries to steal and abuse the name of the people to serve the aggressive and plundering policies of the big US imperialist financial groups.
    The United Nations itself and the representatives of the United Nations are undergoing a serious test. The United Nations is in crisis, and it must liberate itself from the despotism and tyranny of US imperialism to save itself.

    联合国的危机
    何思敬
    最近，在联合国安理会及其他各种机构中，社会主义国家代表与帝国主义国家代表之间为了中国代表问题，发生了极尖锐的争论，由于美国等帝国主义国家的代表无理支持国民党反动残余匪帮的伪代表，苏联代表与新民主主义各国代表在联合国组织的各种会议中已陆续退席，这事震动了全世界。
    争论的起因是这样：
    中国人民以自己的革命鲜血推翻了国民党反动政府，建立了中央人民政府，它当然有权利决定自己出席联合国及其安理会的合法代表。中华人民共和国中央人民政府按照自己的权利这样做了，当然在程序上应当首先否认非法代表，然后决定自己的合法代表，并且依次通知了联合国。这就是中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来首先于一九五○年一月八日向联合国发出的一个照会，“要求联合国及安理会将中国国民党反动残余集团的非法代表予以开除”，然后于一月十九日向联合国表明以张闻天为首席代表的代表团才是中华人民共和国的合法代表团。
    问题的争论首先发生在安理会开除不开除反动残余集团的代表即非法代表上。这问题争得非常旗帜鲜明。
    社会主义国家苏联代表首先主张开除伪代表，苏联的正当的主张，得到了新民主主义国家和印度的代表的赞成。
    在另一方面，美国代表反对开除。法国等美国仆从随声附和了美国的意见。英国、挪威弃权，取首鼠两端的态度。
    这一争论又一次重新证明了社会主义国家苏联及各人民民主国家是帮助中国人民求解放、求独立的朋友，而帝国主义，尤其美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌。我们研究一下双方的论点就可以完全明白。
    苏联代表说：“审查这个问题（开除非法代表）并对这个问题作出决定的惟一准则必须是在国际事务上以及在对其他国家的关系上代表着中国和中国人民的政府所表示的意志。这样的政府就是中华人民共和国中央人民政府”。苏联代表拿出这个政府的电报作为这个政府的意志表示，并指出：“这个电报清清楚楚说明国民党代表已经被剥夺了一切权力，他毫无权利留在安理会”。
    苏联代表在这个发言中不仅拥护了中国人民的利益，而且拥护着为自己解放而斗争的一切人民的基本权利，即各被压迫民族与各国人民有权革命，有权组织自己的政府，这个政府有权否认一切非法代表与派遣自己的合法代表。
    苏联代表明确要求安理会，开除国民党反动集团残余的代表，是完全符合真理的正义行动。安理会若要不犯严重错误，就只能根据客观真理，只能根据一个国家的主体即人民在客观的革命过程中，打倒了一个反动集团，创造了自己的中央政府，并且它在国际事务上以及在对其他国家的关系上已经代表人民有公开的意志表示与活动这个客观事实，而不能根据任何主观的自私自利的捏造，来做这样的决定。这是一个极其严重的原则问题，它关系到全人类的和平与安全，也关系到联合国以及安理会的性质。联合国及安理会是各国的联合组织，如果不顾各民族内部发生的事实，不顾各国人民的意志，那末，这就是不忠实于联合国的原则，使联合国丧失它生存的基础。
    美帝国主义就是要挟持联合国，改变联合国的原则。且看美国代表怎么说。他说：美国“承认授权蒋廷黻出席安理会的政府”。这就是说：美国完全漠视中华人民共和国中央人民政府及其意志表示。这证明美帝国主义的蛮而无理。这种横蛮无理的行为正不仅企图剥夺中国人民、也企图剥夺一切被压迫人民的革命权利。照美帝国主义者的逻辑，任何国家的人民，不得推翻其反动政府，并组织自己的政府，即使已经革命成功，组成了自己的中央政府，也不能派遣其驻联合国的代表！美帝国主义之所以必须支持各国反人民的强盗集团，甚至在其已灭亡以后仍然坚持其“合法政府”的灵位，因为这样做，就有“合法的”工具来“合法地”实施其吸血鬼政策去奴役与搜括各国人民。然而这又一次地使拥有世界人口总数四分之一的中国人民看穿了美帝国主义蹂躏中国人民及各国人民权利、独霸世界的野心。
    美国代表强奸了安理会与联合国！美帝国主义强迫安理会不根据客观真理，而根据美帝国主义侵略政策来决定。这是对全世界的“压迫与虐政”、“专制与独裁的统治”。
    美帝国主义的这种狂妄行为只能是：侵犯了联合国以人民的名义宣布的宪章全体、侵犯了以主权平等之原则为根据的联合国组织（第二条），侵犯了联合国的诸目的：一、维持国际和平及安全……；二、发展国际间以尊重人民平等权利及自决权为根据之友好关系……以增进普遍和平（第一条）。如果让美帝国主义这样横蛮下去，将使联合国和联合国宪章完全被破坏。
    各国人民应当严密注意联合国及安理会里面发生的情形。联合国宪章用人民的名义开了头，如果各国人民不注意联合国和安理会至今发生的情形，那就会有人利用各国人民的不注意来盗窃并滥用人民的名义替美帝国主义大财主的侵略与搜括政策服务。
    联合国本身及联合国的各国代表正在受着一次严重的考验。联合国正在危机中，它必须从美帝国主义的专制与虐政下解放出来挽救自己。
