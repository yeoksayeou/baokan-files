Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 6th: The trade conflict between the United States and Britain has surfaced due to the British government's announcement that it will cut U.S. oil imports by one-half starting January 1, 1950. The British government's reason for reducing U.S. oil imports is to reduce the consumption of U.S. dollars, thereby delaying the exhaustion of its dollar reserves. However, this decision by Britain has infringed upon the interests of U.S. monopoly capital. According to estimates by the U.S. State Department, the United States plans to export a total of $710 million worth of oil to Britain from 1949 to 1950. Therefore, the British government's decision will cause U.S. oil companies to lose more than $350 million in large transactions annually.

This action by Britain has greatly troubled the United States. The U.S. State Department issued a statement on December 21st of last year, stating: "We have expressed our concern to the British government regarding this matter and hope to discuss it again in order to reduce the disruption caused to U.S. companies by this change." The statement also revealed that the United States has been negotiating with Britain to pressure Britain to change its decision so that it "can maintain the interests of continued overseas oil production by the United States."

TASS, New York: U.S. monopoly capital newspapers have launched massive attacks on Britain's decision. The New York Times condemned Britain's purpose as not to reduce British dollar consumption, but to drive U.S. oil companies out of the markets of countries in the sterling bloc. The Journal of Commerce predicted that all or the vast majority of countries in the sterling bloc would soon implement the same restrictions, and they would become even tighter. Spokespersons for U.S. monopoly capital even stated that the United States would use the suspension of "Marshall Plan" "aid" to pressure Britain to change its decision. Hurley, chairman of the National Petroleum Council, established by the U.S. Department of the Interior and specializing in planning U.S. domestic and foreign oil policies, and the Washington Post, both bluntly raised this threat.

U.S. Congressman from the "oil" state of Oklahoma, Mansfield, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also declared that Congress may consider "necessary measures" to protect the interests of the U.S. oil industry. Mansfield advocated that before considering such measures, the U.S. State Department and the "Economic Cooperation Administration" implementing the "Marshall Plan" should require Britain to "fully explain" the reasons for deciding to reduce imports of U.S. oil products. Washington news sources said that unless Britain makes concessions in the current U.S.-British oil talks in Washington, the United States may stop exporting oil equipment to Britain, which is greatly needed by the British oil industry.

    美英石油矛盾表面化
    英削减美石油入口二分之一  美独占资本报纸正大肆攻击
    【新华社北京六日电】美英两国在贸易上的矛盾，已因英国政府宣布自一九五○年一月一日起削减美国石油入口二分之一一事，而趋于表面化。英国政府之所以削减美国石油入口，是想以此减少美元的消耗，从而延缓美元存底的枯竭。但英国这一决定，触犯了美国独占资本的利益。据美国国务院估计，一九四九至一九五○年，美国准备向英国总共输出七亿一千万美元的石油，因此，英国政府的决定，将使美国石油公司每年损失三亿五千万美元以上的大宗交易。
    英国此举已使美国方面大感烦恼。美国国务院曾于去年十二月二十一日发表声明称：“对于此事已向英国政府提出表示关切之意，希望能重行加以讨论，以期减少这一变动所引起的美国公司的紊乱。”声明又透露，美国已与英国进行谈判，以压迫英国变更其决定，俾“能维持美国继续海外石油生产之利益”。
    塔斯社纽约电指出：美国独占资本的报纸已大肆攻击英国的决定。纽约时报谴责英国的目的不是在减少英国的美元消耗，而是在把美国石油公司逐出英镑集团国家的市场。商务日报预言，全体或绝大多数英镑集团国家，也很快就会施行同样的限制，而且将会更形紧缩。美国独占资本的代言人甚至表示，美国将以停止“马歇尔计划”的“援助”，来压迫英国改变其决定。美国内政部设立的、专事策划美国关于石油的国内国外政策的全国石油委员会主席哈雷南与华盛顿邮报，都率直地提出了这种威胁。
    美国“石油”州俄克拉哈马州的国会议员、众院外交委员会委员孟斯菲尔德亦宣称，国会可能考虑“必要的措施”，以保护美国石油工业的利益。孟斯菲尔德主张在考虑这种措施之前，美国国务院和执行“马歇尔计划”的“经济合作总署”，应要求英国“充分说明”决定减少美国石油产品入口的理由。华盛顿新闻界人士说，除非英国在目前华盛顿进行的英美石油谈判中让步，否则，美国可能停止对英输出石油装备，而这些装备是英国石油工业所大为需要的。
