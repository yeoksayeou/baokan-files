Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 11th: TASS reports: The Czech Foreign Ministry delivered a note to the Yugoslav Embassy in the Czech Republic on the 6th, firmly protesting the South government's persecution of Czech and Slovak minority citizens within its borders. The note cited many facts illustrating the cruel persecution by the Yugoslav authorities of Czech and Slovak citizens residing in Yugoslavia because they expressed their willingness to return to the Czech Republic according to the "Repatriation Treaty" signed between the two countries in 1948. Many prominent representatives of the Czech and Slovak minorities have been arrested or even shot for disagreeing with the anti-democratic and anti-Soviet policies of the Yugoslav fascist rulers. The note concluded that this action by the Yugoslav authorities is a new manifestation of hostile acts against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and once again demonstrates that the Yugoslav government is a tool of the imperialists in preparing for an offensive against the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism. The note demanded that the Yugoslav government release those arrested.

    南政府迫害境内捷公民
    捷政府提出抗议
    【新华社北京十一日电】据塔斯社讯：捷外交部六日以照会一件，递交南斯拉夫驻捷大使馆，坚决抗议南政府迫害境内捷克和斯洛伐克少数民族的公民。照会引证了许多事实，说明那些住在南国境内的捷克与斯洛伐克族公民，因为表示愿意根据捷南两国在一九四八年间所签订的《归遣条约》移回捷克而遭受南斯拉夫当局残酷迫害的情形。很多捷克与斯洛伐克少数民族的杰出代表人物，因为不同意南斯拉夫法西斯统治者的反民主与反苏政策而被逮捕，甚至被枪杀。照会最后指出：南斯拉夫当局这种行动，是对苏联和人民民主国家敌意行为的新的活动方式，再一次表明了南斯拉夫政府就是帝国主义者在准备对和平、民主与社会主义力量进攻中的工具。照会要求南斯拉夫政府释放被捕者。
