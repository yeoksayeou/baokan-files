Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 18th:

    According to a dispatch from the U.S. Information Service in Washington on January 15th, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Butterworth issued a statement on January 14th, grossly distorting the Beijing Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's legitimate recovery of land for the U.S., French, and Dutch barracks within the city and requisitioning of the barracks and other buildings on this land. Butterworth first stated that the order of the Beijing Military Control Commission "violated the long-standing rights granted to the United States in 1901 and reaffirmed in the 1943 Sino-American treaty"; then he said that what the Beijing Military Control Commission wanted to recover and requisition was the "office address and property of the U.S. consulate," not the barracks; finally, he threatened that if the Chinese government were to implement this decree, they "would withdraw all U.S. official personnel from Communist China." U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman John Kee, among others, also made similar statements.
    In fact, the U.S. State Department's claim that the order of the Beijing Military Control Commission violated Sino-American treaties is nothing but an untenable sophistry. The "Common Program" of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has already clearly declared that all imperialist privileges in China and all unequal treaties will be abolished, regardless of whether they are "long-standing" or "reaffirmed in 1943." The Beijing Military Control Commission has the obligation to implement the "Common Program" of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, but has no obligation to implement these unequal treaties. All law-abiding foreigners in Beijing, including former foreign consuls stationed in Beijing, should unconditionally obey and implement the orders of the Beijing Military Control Commission, and should not vainly attempt to maintain old privileges; otherwise, they would be violating our government's laws and infringing upon our country's sovereignty. It is worth pointing out here that even in the "treaty" concluded in 1943 between the Kuomintang reactionary government and the U.S. government, cited by Butterworth, there was no clause reaffirming the privilege of the U.S. to maintain barracks in China, although in fact the Kuomintang reactionary government allowed the U.S. to illegally maintain barracks in China and attempted to offer the entire Chinese territory as barracks for the U.S.
    The U.S. State Department's statement that the Beijing Military Control Commission seized the U.S. consulate is a slander, the purpose of which is to deceive and incite those who are unaware of the truth. What the Beijing Military Control Commission recovered was not any consulate's "office address and property," but rather land occupied by certain foreign countries based on the so-called "right to station troops" in unequal treaties; what is to be requisitioned is only the barracks on this land; moreover, our People's Government will formulate other measures to resolve the property issues arising from the recovery of this land. The U.S. State Department dares not announce the truth of these facts, and can only insist that this is an "act of infringing on U.S. consulate property." The land forcibly occupied by the U.S. relying on the so-called "right to station troops," used for the U.S. to station troops in China, and recovered by the Beijing Military Control Commission this time, is at No. 22 Dongjiaomin Lane, Beijing, while the (former) U.S. Consulate in Beijing is at No. 23 Dongjiaomin Lane, Beijing. But under the fingers of the magician Butterworth, the former U.S. barracks suddenly became the "property of the U.S. consulate"! Is this perhaps the "international practice" of the American imperialists?
    As for the U.S. State Department's threats, they are simply laughable. The Chinese people, in upholding their own interests and defending the sovereignty of their own people's motherland, never consider the will of any imperialists. All unequal treaties and aggressive privileges created by imperialists in China must be abolished. Whether the imperialists withdraw or not, whether they clamor or threaten, will have no impact on this just position of us Chinese people.
    Butterworth and other American imperialist elements seem to have misunderstood one thing. Beijing now belongs to the People's Republic of China, and is no longer the world of Kuomintang traitors. Therefore, the posturing "threats" of the Butterworths and the like, in the eyes of the Chinese people, can only be worthless jokes.

### 美国国务院的狡辩、诬赖和威胁

    美国国务院的狡辩、诬赖和威胁
    据美国新闻处华盛顿十五日电，美国国务院助理国务卿白德华于一月十四日发表谈话，对于中国人民解放军北京市军事管制委员会正当地收回市内美、法、荷三国兵营地产并征用此项地产上的兵营和其他建筑物一事，大肆歪曲。白德华始则说北京市军管会的命令“违反了一九○一年给予美国的，并在一九四三年中美条约中加以重申的，久已存在的权利”；再则说，北京市军管会要收回和征用的是美国“领事馆的办公地址及产业”，而不是兵营；最后则威胁地说，倘若中国政府要执行这个法令，他们“就要从共产党中国撤退所有美国官方人员”。美国国会参议院外交委员会主席康纳利和众议院外交委员会主席季约翰等人，也发表了类似的谈话。
    事实上，美国国务院所说的北京市军管会的命令违反中美条约云云，只是一种不能成立的狡辩。中国人民政治协商会议的“共同纲领”中已经明白宣布要取消一切帝国主义的在华特权和一切不平等条约，不管它们是“久已存在”的也好，是“一九四三年重申过”的也好。北京市军管会有义务执行中国人民政协的“共同纲领”，但决无义务执行这些不平等条约。而在北京的一切守法外侨，包括外国驻京前领事在内，则应当无条件地服从和执行北京市军管会的命令，而不应当妄想保持旧日的特权，否则就是违背我国政府的法令，侵犯我国的主权。在这里，值得指出的是，甚至在白德华所援引的一九四三年国民党反动政府与美国政府所订的“条约”中，也并没有重申美帝在华保有兵营的特权的字句，尽管事实上国民党反动政府任由美帝在华非法地保有兵营，并企图将全中国的国土供献为美帝的兵营。
    美国国务院说北京市军管会侵占美国领事馆，这是一种诬赖，其目的是为着对不明真相者施行欺骗和煽动。北京市军事管制委员会所收回的不是任何领事馆的“办公地址及产业”，而是某些外国根据不平等条约中的所谓“驻兵权”而占据的地产；所要征用的只是此项地产上的兵营；而且因此项地产收回所产生的房产问题，我人民政府还要另定办法解决。美国国务院不敢宣布这些事实的真相，只好硬说这是“侵犯美国领事馆产业的行为”。美帝依靠所谓“驻兵权”而强占的，为美帝在华驻兵之用的，并为此次北京市军管会所收回的地产，是在北京东交民巷二十二号，而（前）北京美国领事馆则是在北京东交民巷二十三号。但是在魔术师白德华的手指下，前美国兵营却忽然之间变成“美国领事馆的产业”了！这大概就是美帝国主义者的“国际惯例”吧？
    至于美国国务院的威胁，简直是可笑的。中国人民在维护自己的利益以及保卫自己人民祖国的主权的立场上，是从不考虑一切帝国主义者的意志的。帝国主义者在中国所制造的一切不平等条约和侵略特权，必须废除。帝国主义者撤退也好，不撤退也好，叫嚣也好，威胁也好，对我们中国人民的这个正义立场丝毫没有影响。
    白德华和其他美国帝国主义分子似乎弄错了一件事。北京现在是属于中华人民共和国，而不再是国民党卖国贼们的天下了。因此，白德华之流的装腔作势的“威胁”，在中国人民看来，只能是不值一文的笑谈。
