    Under the Common Program
    The Direction of Effort for Journalists
    Liu Zunqi
            I. Propaganda and Supervision
    The People's Political Consultative Conference's "Common Program," this great charter, was adopted with the unreserved agreement of all the journalists' representatives participating in the CPPCC. During the discussion of the "Common Program" draft, the fourteen representatives from the press, in addition to expressing many opinions during group discussions with various parties, organizations, and other representatives, also held their own separate meetings to discuss all its articles in detail, especially the provisions relating to the press and publication. When the final amendment to the "Common Program" draft was submitted for discussion at the plenary session, the journalists' representatives found that all their active opinions had been included, and thus unanimously supported its passage. When they did so, they were convinced that the vast majority of journalists across the country would, as their chief representative Comrade Hu Qiaomu said in his speech, "strive to support it with practical actions."
    Comrade Hu Qiaomu's speech represented journalists across the country, declaring the common tasks we will undertake in the future. He said:
    "After the plenary session adopts these three documents (the CPPCC Common Program, the CPPCC Organizational Law, the Central People's Government Organizational Law), we in the press have decided to strive to support them with practical actions. We have two methods: one is propaganda. We will repeatedly and widely publicize the significance of the three documents and the significance of the entire CPPCC to the people of the whole country, and call on the people of the whole country to strive to realize the Common Program and all resolutions of the CPPCC under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government. The other is supervision; we will use the power of public opinion to assist the people's supervisory organs in supervising whether governments at all levels and all democratic parties and people's organizations faithfully implement the Common Program and all resolutions of the CPPCC."
    Journalists across the country must regard the propaganda of the "Common Program" as a major task, because the full realization of this grand charter of seven chapters and sixty articles depends, first and foremost, on us making it something that the people of the whole country commonly understand, cherish, and abide by. Its passage itself does not equal its practice in China. The content of the "Common Program" includes, on the one hand, the entire blueprint for China's democratic construction, and on the other hand, an uncompromising struggle against China's internal and external enemies, as well as against backwardness and narrow-mindedness. This must be made known to every household through extensive and patient propaganda and education, so that the masses of the people regard it as their own program representing their current greatest interests, and strive for its realization.
    Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, there were occasionally some decrees and resolutions published as smokescreens or "sugar coatings," but you were never allowed to publicize them. The old CPPCC is one example. For publicizing the resolutions of the old CPPCC, there were the bloody incidents of Cangbaitang and Xiaochangkou. After 1946, citing Chiang Kai-shek's "Four Promises" and the resolutions of the old CPPCC became dangerous taboos for newspapers. Today, under the people's democratic regime, everything is exactly the opposite. We must not only extensively publicize the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference, but also use the power of public opinion to supervise at any time whether governments at all levels and all democratic parties and people's organizations faithfully implement all its provisions.
    The main reason why our journalists can undertake such important tasks is that the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution has achieved a basic victory. The "Common Program" established on this basis guarantees our working conditions. Article 49 of the "Common Program" stipulates: "Protect the freedom of reporting true news." The Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference itself and all other resolutions are, of course, the greatest "truth" in China today. They reflect the unprecedented great unity and common interests of China's four progressive classes, and demonstrate the determination of this alliance, under the leadership of the working class, to continue to consolidate this unity and realize these common interests. All of this is news that could not be more true.
            II. Two Different Directions
    However, the main significance of Article 49 of the "Common Program" naturally does not lie solely in this.
    This provision is a fundamental feature that distinguishes socialism and people's democracy from bourgeois democracy in the field of journalism. The freedom to report true news is directly opposed to the freedom to fabricate and deceive news. It not only guarantees the necessary working conditions for journalists, but also guarantees the right of the broad masses of people to express their daily lives and opinions and to know what true things are happening around them. This is a freedom and right impossible in capitalist society or a society ruled by feudal bureaucrats and capitalists.
    The disasters caused by "freedom of the press" in capitalist countries to mankind are already well-known. As a result of news tools being in the hands of a few monopolistic capitalists, all news undertakings have become their most vicious means of pursuing profits, anesthetizing and deceiving the people, arbitrarily slandering, and "freely" inciting wars and spreading fascist ideas.
    Under such a system, journalists do not have the freedom to report true news, and readers and listeners do not have the freedom to know true news. This is the direction of sin and death. Our direction is completely on the opposite side.
    The real people's freedom of the press first appeared in the socialist Soviet Union. There, newspapers, radio broadcasts, and all other news weapons are the property of the working people themselves, tools for mobilizing and educating the broad masses of people, and have become reliable pillars of national construction thanks to the participation of millions of worker-peasant journalists.
    Secondly, in new democratic countries, although private enterprises still exist more or less, the main news undertakings all belong to state-owned or public-owned enterprises. Purely commercial newspapers have completely disappeared in people's democratic countries.
    The common mission of the people's press is to truthfully report the plans and activities of national construction, mobilize the people to fight for a higher standard of living; support peaceful policies, develop and strengthen friendship and cooperation between nations, and fight for the independence and integrity of all countries, large and small, and for international peace and security; expose the enemies of democracy and the aggressive conspiracies of imperialism and all reactionaries, and call on all peace-loving nations to fight for democratic principles, expose the remnants of fascism, and eradicate its ideology.
    This is the correct direction for Chinese journalists. Thousands of news units in China are also carrying out serious battles in this direction.
    The vast majority of our news undertakings are also no longer or cannot belong to the scope of profit-seeking enterprises, but are basically people's public undertakings led by the working class. The vast majority of journalists are no longer bound by the profit and loss calculations of bosses, and are no longer subject to prior censorship by reactionary bureaucrats. Our main consideration is whether it conforms to the interests of the people, and the standard for checking our work is the "Common Program" passed by the People's Political Consultative Conference. This enables us to report everything related to the interests of the people, true news, true problems, true shortcomings, true threats, true activities, and true progress and victories.
            III. Truth and Responsibility
    Have all of our journalists realized such a broad and vast world of free activity? It is undeniable that many of us have not realized it. Especially journalists in newly liberated cities, many people have not realized how historically significant it is that they can openly rebuke and expose the people's enemies—imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—and boldly and fully report the true activities of the people today. The victorious development of the People's Liberation War under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the close combination of the army and the people, the great people's unity, and the Mao Zedong Thought that made all this possible, can be unrestrictedly and truthfully elaborated, which is the most gigantic liberation of the Chinese press. In such an environment of great liberation, some people still feel restrained and "easily make mistakes," which is a very noteworthy phenomenon.
    People with this kind of mentality can be divided into two categories. One type of person is fundamentally dominated by the bourgeoisie's irresponsible liberalism and cannot extricate themselves. Those who have long been indulged in the smoke-filled salons will feel repulsed when suddenly placed in the vast open field with clear skies and abundant sunshine. The other type of person is the petty bourgeoisie's revolutionary romantic. They indeed cannot tolerate the suffocating control of the Kuomintang reactionaries, but they also feel distressed by this restriction of having to be responsible to the people. In fact, the disease of these two types of people is the same, that is, they are unwilling to get close to the masses, understand the masses, and put themselves among the masses to serve them. They lack the spirit of "willingly serving as an ox for the children," as Lu Xun said, which is essential for being a people's journalist. They can only find "truth" in the whereabouts and speeches of important people, and in sensational sudden events, without experiencing the creative "truth" in the continuous struggle life of the broad masses of people.
    Regarding the "freedom of the press" in the old society that was divorced from the people and disregarded or violated the interests of the people as more, real "freedom," and regarding the freedom of the press in a society where the people are masters, with the interests of the people as the premise, as less freedom or unfreedom—here lies a fundamental point of view issue. This is the point of view of the exploiters. As a journalist with a working-class consciousness, one must strive to liquidate this point of view.
    At the same time, the "protection of the freedom of reporting true news" in the "Common Program" has nothing to do with "objectivism." Most of our social life today is still filled with the old and decadent dregs. A vulgar journalist, holding an attitude of "recording everything heard," can be busy all day listing these undying phenomena without paying attention to the newborn truth, which contributes nothing to the people.
    It is true that marital disputes and murder cases in our society have not suddenly disappeared because of the establishment of the People's Government. These are all real existences in life. Military and diplomatic secrets are of course also real existences. But perhaps only journalists who have lost their patriotism and sense of responsibility would use the clause "protecting the freedom of reporting true news" to arbitrarily extract material from them. Unprincipled "reporting of truth" will inevitably lead to surrender to bourgeois "objectivism." Zhdanov's criticism of the writer Zoshchenko in his report on the errors committed by the magazines "Star" and "Leningrad" is worthy of our vigilance: "... he wrote many things, all symbolizing his inability to find any normal phenomenon, any normal type, in the life of the Soviet people."
    Article 49 of the "Common Program" stipulates immediately after "protecting the freedom of reporting true news": "It is forbidden to use news to carry out defamation, undermine the interests of the state and the people, and incite war." Protecting doing good on one hand and prohibiting doing bad things on the other is the spirit of the people's democratic dictatorship. This spirit is what every journalist on the front line of ideological struggle must firmly grasp.
    In capitalist countries, such as the United States, publishing defamatory news is in fact encouraged (American law only imposes a fine of seven dollars after lengthy litigation for the crime of defaming individuals). As for the defamation of the entire working class, black people, other nations, and other countries, it is even more unrestricted. Conversely, our news undertakings regard being responsible to the Chinese people themselves and being responsible to other people in the world as unified and inseparable.
            IV. Criticism and Self-Criticism
    If we only report the good and progressive aspects of our society, and sing praises and praises, have we completed our task? We should say that that is already done well, and the new China urgently needs such work. But that is only part of the "truth," maybe a large part. Today, another part of China's "truth" is still unsound and hinders our progress. For this part, responsible journalists should further use their news tools as weapons of criticism and self-criticism.
    In the huge and complex cause of building a new China, we will inevitably encounter many mistakes, biases, corruption, waste, bureaucratic tendencies, and other problems. Journalists in their own positions should be relatively easy to discover these problems, then exposing and criticizing them is our important task. Only those who are confused and blindly follow bourgeois propaganda believe that criticism is not allowed in socialist or people's democratic countries. Stalin, in referring to the large number of worker-peasant correspondents' criticisms and accusations against state affairs and administrative personnel published in Soviet newspapers, wrote: "Only worker and peasant correspondents as an organizing force can play the role of performers and leaders of proletarian public opinion, exposers of the shortcomings of Soviet society, and indomitable fighters for improving our construction in the process of newspaper development."
    Our worker and peasant correspondents, or even journalists of worker and peasant origin, still need to be cultivated in large numbers, but journalists with Marxist-Leninist ideas already occupy the decisive majority. As long as we are willing to earnestly go deep into the masses, reflect the masses, it will not be difficult to discover the difficulties they encounter, the objects they hate, and their opinions on reforms. This is also the only effective preparation for conducting criticism and self-criticism. For example, to expose and criticize a bureaucratic event, one cannot rely on the subjective impression of a journalist, but must investigate and understand from the masses and cadres who are directly and indirectly affected by that event, find the root causes, and listen to their opinions on how to correct it, and then judge it against the basic policies of the People's Government. Only such criticism can have sufficient basis and propose reform methods. This criticism is an important driving force for the construction of the new China.
    On the other hand, journalists are not omnipotent geniuses, and it is inevitable that mistakes and biases will occur in reporting and criticism. This requires humbly learning, learning dialectical materialism, learning Marxism-Leninism, learning Mao Zedong Thought, learning policies, learning the "Common Program," learning one's own business and the objects of the business. We must be prepared to constantly accept criticism, and after making mistakes, we must develop the spirit of self-criticism, re-investigate and study the true situation, and bravely admit mistakes and correct them. Only in this way can we continuously improve and reduce the possible adverse effects on the masses.
    The newborn people's China has given journalists a vast and boundless field of activity. The "Common Program" indicates our common direction and guarantees the freedom of our activities. We can report truth, sing praises of progress, expose enemies, and strike at sin. We must boldly and joyfully use this rare freedom. As long as we are willing to learn, willing to go among the masses, willing to grasp the truth, and willing to take responsibility, we will surely be able to gloriously complete our tasks.

    在共同纲领下
    新闻工作者的努力方向
    刘尊棋
            一  宣传和监督
    人民政协《共同纲领》这个伟大宪章，是在新闻工作者参加政协的全体代表无保留的同意之下通过的。在《共同纲领》草案的讨论期间，十四个新闻界的代表除分别与各党派团体和其他代表举行分组讨论时发表了许多意见外，他们自身并单独开会，详细讨论了它的全部条文，特别是有关新闻出版的规定。到了《共同纲领》草案的最后修正案提交全体大会讨论时，新闻界代表们就发现所有他们的积极意见都已包括在内，因而全体一致拥护它的通过。当他们这样做的时候，他们是深信：全国绝大多数的新闻工作者必能如他们的首席代表胡乔木同志发言所说的，“努力用实际的行动来加以拥护。”
    胡乔木同志的发言代表了全国新闻工作者，宣示我们今后要承担的共同任务。他说：
    “在全体会议通过这三个文件（政协共同纲领，政协组织法，中央人民政府组织法）以后，我们新闻界同人决定努力用实际的行动来加以拥护。我们的办法有两个：一个是宣传。我们要把三个文件的意义和整个人民政协的意义向全国人民作反复的广泛的宣传，号召全国人民在中央人民政府的统一领导之下，为实现共同纲领和人民政协的一切决议而奋斗。再一个是监督；我们要用人民舆论的力量，协助人民监察机关，来监督各级政府和一切民主党派人民团体是否忠实地执行共同纲领和人民政协的一切决议。”
    全国新闻工作者要把宣传《共同纲领》当做一个重大任务，因为这个七章六十条的大宪章的全部实现，首先要靠我们使它变成为全国人民共同了解、共同珍视，和共同遵守的东西。它的通过本身并不等于在中国得到了实践。“共同纲领”的内容一方面包括了中国人民民主建设的全部蓝图，另一方面也包括了对中国的内外敌人、以及对落后和偏狭的不可妥协的斗争。这是要通过广泛和耐心的宣传教育方能家喻户晓，使人民大众把它当做代表他们目前最大利益的自己的纲领，而为其实现来奋斗的。
    在国民党反动统治之下，偶然也有些做为烟幕或“糖衣”而发表的法令决议，但那是决不许你做宣传的。旧政协就是一个例子。为了宣传旧政协的决议，曾有过沧白堂和校场口的血腥事件。在一九四六年以后，引证蒋介石“四项诺言”和旧政协的决议，成了报纸的危险忌讳。在今天人民民主政权之下，一切恰恰相反，我们不但要大量宣传人民政协共同纲领，而且要用人民舆论的力量，随时监督各级政府和一切民主党派人民团体是否忠实地执行它的全部规定。
    我们新闻工作者能够承担这样重大的任务，主要是因为中国人民民主革命已获得了基本的胜利。在这个基础上建立起来的《共同纲领》，保证了我们的工作条件。《共同纲领》第四十九条规定：“保护报道真实新闻的自由”。人民政协的共同纲领本身和一切其他决议案，当然是中国今天最大的“真实”。它们反映了中国四大进步阶级的空前伟大团结及其共同利益，表现了这一联盟在工人阶级领导之下继续巩固这个团结和实现这些共同利益的决心。这一切都是再真实没有的新闻。
            二  两个不同的方向
    不过，《共同纲领》第四十九条规定的主要意义自然不在于此。
    这一个规定是社会主义和人民民主主义在新闻领域中区别于资产阶级民主主义的基本特征。报道真实新闻的自由，是和伪造欺骗新闻的自由正面对立的。它不仅是保障新闻工作者的必要的活动条件，也保障了广大人民把他们的日常生活和意见发表出来并能知道在他们周围究竟发生了什么真实事情的权利。这是资本主义社会或封建官僚资产统治的社会中不可能有的自由权利。
    资本主义国家中的“新闻自由”在人类中造成的灾害，已为尽人皆知的事。由于新闻工具掌握在少数独占资本家手中的结果，一切新闻事业就变成了他们追求利润、麻醉和欺骗人民、任意毁谤、“自由”地煽动战争、散播法西斯思想的最恶毒的手段。
    在这样的制度之下，新闻工作者没有报道真实新闻的自由，读者和听众没有知道真实新闻的自由。这是罪恶和死亡的方向。我们的方向完全在相反的一面。
    真正人民的新闻自由首先出现在社会主义的苏联。在那里，报纸、无线电广播、和一切其他新闻的武器都是劳动人民自己的财产，动员和教育广大人民的工具，更由于千百万工农新闻工作者的参加而成为国家建设的可靠支柱。
    其次，在新民主主义国家中，虽然私营企业还或多或少的存在着，但主要的新闻事业则一律属于国营或公营。纯商业性的报纸在人民民主国家中已经完全绝迹。
    人民新闻事业的共同使命就在于把国家建设的计划和活动真实地报道出来，动员人民为争取更高的生活水平而作战；支持和平政策，发展和加强各民族间的友谊合作，为争取各大小国家的独立完整、为国际的和平安全而战斗；暴露民主的敌人和帝国主义与一切反动派的侵略阴谋，号召所有爱好和平的民族为争取民主的原则、为暴露法西斯余孽和根除其思想而战斗。
    这才是中国新闻工作者的正确方向。中国成千上万的新闻部队也正是在这一方向进行着严肃的战斗。
    我们的绝大部分的新闻事业也已不是或不可能属于利润追求的企业范围，而基本上是以工人阶级为领导的人民公营事业了。绝大部分的新闻工作者已不受老板的盈亏算盘的拘束，已不受反动官僚的事前检查。我们最主要的考虑是符合不符合人民的利益，而检查我们工作的标准是人民政协所通过的“共同纲领”。这样就使我们有条件来把与人民利益有关的一切真实新闻、真实问题、真实缺点、真实威胁、真实活动、与真实的进步和胜利，报道出来。
            三  真实和负责
    这样宽广辽阔的自由活动天地，是不是我们每一个新闻工作者都意识到了呢？不可否认，我们中间有不少人还没有意识到。特别是在新解放城市中的新闻工作者，许多人没有意识到他们今天可以公开斥责和揭发人民公敌——帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，可以大胆地充分地报道人民的真实活动，这是多么富有历史意义的变化。在中国共产党领导下的人民解放战争的胜利发展、军队和人民的亲密结合、伟大的人民团结、和使这一切成为可能的毛泽东思想，能够无限制地如实地阐扬，这是中国新闻界的最巨大的解放。在这样大解放的环境中，还有人感到缩手缩脚，“动辄得咎”，这是很可注意的现象。
    具有这种心理的人可分为两类。一种人是根本受了资产阶级不负责任的自由主义所支配，而不能自拔的。长期沈迷在烟雾迷蒙的沙龙中的客里空们，一下子被放在天高气爽阳光充沛的旷野，是会发生反感的。另外一种人是小资产阶级的革命罗曼蒂克。他们的确不能忍受国民党反动派窒息的控制，但也为了必须对人民负责的这种限制，而感到苦闷。其实，这两种人的病症是一个，就是不愿接近群众、了解群众，不愿把自己放在群众里面，为他们服务。他们缺乏着鲁迅所说的“俯首甘为孺子牛”的那种做为人民新闻工作者必须具备的精神。他们只能在要人的行踪和说话中，从耸人听闻的突发事件中，发现到“真实”，而没有体验到在广大人民不断斗争生活中的创造的“真实”。
    把旧社会中那种脱离人民、漠视或违背人民利益的“新闻自由”，看成为更多的、真正的“自由”，把人民做主人的社会中以人民利益为前提的新闻自由，看成为更小的自由或不自由——这里就存在着一个根本的观点问题了。这就是剥削者的观点。做为一个有劳动阶级意识的新闻工作者，必须努力来清算这种观点。
    同时，《共同纲领》中的“保护报道真实新闻的自由”，与“客观主义”是没有丝毫关系的。我们今天的社会大部分生活还充塞着旧的腐朽的渣滓。一个庸俗的新闻记者，抱着“有闻必录”的态度，可以终日忙于罗列这些未死的现象，而不注视新生的真实，那是对人民没有任何贡献的。
    不错，我们社会中的婚姻纠纷和凶杀案件，并没有因为人民政府的成立而忽然消灭。这都是生活中的真实存在。军事和外交的秘密当然也是真实的存在。但是恐怕只有丧失爱国心和责任心的新闻记者才会利用“保护报道真实新闻的自由”这一条款来任意从中取材吧。无原则地“报道真实”必然流于对资产阶级“客观主义”的投降。日丹诺夫在关于《星》和《列宁格勒》杂志所犯错误的报告中，批评作家左琴柯的话是值得我们警戒的：“……他写了许多东西，都象征着他不善于在苏联人民生活中找出任何一种正常的现象，任何一个正常的典型。”
    《共同纲领》第四十九条在“保护报道真实新闻的自由”之下，紧接着规定：“禁止利用新闻的进行诽谤，破坏国家人民利益和煽动战争”。一面保护做好事，一面禁止做坏事，这就是人民专政的精神。这个精神是每一个在思想斗争前线的新闻工作者必须紧紧把握住的。
    在资本主义国家，如美国，刊登诽谤的新闻，事实上是受着鼓励的（美国法律对诽谤个人罪，经长时间诉讼判决后只处以七块钱的罚款）。至于对整个工人阶级、黑人、别的民族和别的国家的诽谤，更是漫无限制了。反之，我们的新闻事业对中国自己人民负责和对世界其他人民负责，看成是统一而不可分的。
            四  批评和自我批评
    假如我们只报道了我们社会中好的和前进的一面，加以歌颂赞扬，是不是就完成了我们的任务呢？我们应该说，那已经做得不错，新中国极端需要这样的工作。可是那只是“真实”的一部分，也许是一大部分。今天中国的“真实”的另一部分，还是不健全的，妨碍我们前进的。对于这一部分，有责任心的新闻工作者要进一步运用他们的新闻工具为批评与自我批评的武器。
    在建设新中国的庞大繁复事业中，我们不可避免地会遇到许多错误、偏向、贪污、浪费，官僚主义之类的毛病。新闻工作者在自己的岗位上应该比较容易发现这些毛病，那么揭发和批评就是我们重要的任务。只有糊里糊涂盲从资产阶级宣传的人，才以为在社会主义或人民民主国家中不允许批评。斯大林在论及苏联报纸上刊登的多量的工农通信员对国家事务和行政人员的批评指摘时，曾这样写道：“只有作为组织力量的工人和农民通信员能够在报纸发展的过程中扮演无产阶级舆论的表演者和领导者、苏维埃社会缺点的揭发者、和争取改善我国建设的不屈不挠的战士的角色。”
    我国工人农民通信员，或甚至工农出身的新闻工作者，还有待于大量的培养，但是有马克思列宁主义思想的新闻工作者已占决定的多数。我们只要肯认真深入群众、反映群众，也就不难发现出他们所遭遇的困难，所痛恶的对象、和他们对于改革的意见。这也是唯一有效进行批评与自我批评的准备。举例来说，揭发和批评一个官僚主义的事件，决不能靠新闻记者主观的印象，必须从直接和间接受到那个事件影响的群众和干部中调查了解，寻找根源，并听取他们对于如何纠正的意见，然后再对照着人民政府的基本政策加以判断。只有这样的批评才能有充分根据和提出改革的办法。这种批评是新中国建设的一个重要推动力。
    在另一方面，新闻工作者既不是一个全能的天才，在报道上和批评上发生错误与偏向，也是难以避免的。这就需要虚心学习，学习辩证唯物论，学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东思想、学习政策、学习《共同纲领》、学习自己业务和业务的对象。我们要准备不断接受批评，在发生了错误之后，要发挥自我批评的精神，重新调查研究真实情况，勇于认错改过。唯有如此，方能使我们不断进步和减少对群众可能发生的不良影响。
    新生的人民中国给了新闻工作者一个广阔无边的活动领域。《共同纲领》指示了我们共同的方向，保证了我们活动的自由。我们可以报道真实，歌颂进步，暴露敌人，打击罪恶。我们要大胆地、欢欣鼓舞地运用这样难得的自由。只要我们肯学习、肯走入群众、肯把握真实、肯负起责任，我们必能光荣地完成我们的任务。
