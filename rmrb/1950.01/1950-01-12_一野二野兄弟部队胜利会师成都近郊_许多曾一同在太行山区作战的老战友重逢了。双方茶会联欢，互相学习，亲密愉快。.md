    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 11th: The First and Second Field Armies, brother units which fought side-by-side to victoriously complete the great encirclement and annihilation battle of Chengdu, have victoriously met near Chengdu. At the meeting, the two armies extended warm welcomes and greetings to each other. On the 28th of last month, a unit of the Second Field Army stationed in Shiyangchang, upon hearing that troops from the First Field Army were coming to be stationed there, immediately cleaned up their housing and vacated it, and prepared grain and firewood in advance. When the First Field Army troops arrived in Shiyangchang, the commanders and fighters of the Second Field Army all went to the streets to welcome them. In the enthusiastic cheers and applause, thousands of hands were clasped tightly. After settling in, the unit also sent representatives to visit and express their regards from place to place. On the 5th of this month, the First Field Army troops guarding Chengdu sent people to Jianyang to visit a unit of the Second Field Army and held a tea party and gathering there. Many of them were old comrades-in-arms who had persevered in the Taihang Mountains during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Everyone was delighted that after the victory of the national revolution, they were jointly undertaking the task of building a new Southwest. At the meeting, both sides cordially learned from each other. The comrades of the First Field Army introduced in detail the situation of production and construction in the old liberated areas of North and Northwest China and the heroic stories of attacking Taiyuan and liberating the vast areas of the Northwest. The comrades of the Second Field Army also told them about their advance into the Dabie Mountains, the Huaihai Campaign, the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign, and the advance into the Southwest. The gathering continued for seven hours, filled with a close and joyful atmosphere.
