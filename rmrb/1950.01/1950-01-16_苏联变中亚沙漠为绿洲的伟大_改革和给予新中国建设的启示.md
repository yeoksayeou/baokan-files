The answer to this question should be considered from at least the following four aspects: the basis of geological evolution, the existing geographical foundation, the needs of economic development, and the nature of social organization. The first two can be said to be the possibilities provided by the natural environment, while the latter two can be said to be the necessities created by social and economic forms. If we analyze it this way, we may gain a deeper understanding of the Soviet Union's plan to transform nature.

Regarding the plan to divert the Ob and Yenisei rivers in Siberia to irrigate the desert areas of Soviet Central Asia, so far only two pieces of information have been seen. One is a news item published in the People's Daily on November 19th - "The Soviet Union will divert the Ob and Yenisei rivers to transform the Central Asian desert into fertile fields." The other is an article published in the same newspaper on December 26th in the "Soviet Studies" supplement, issue 32, titled "Diversion of Siberian Rivers - A Great Plan for Soviet Transformation of Nature," written by Romashkov and translated by Hai Cheng. From this translated article, we learned about the general outline of this plan. Now, we will discuss it based on this known outline and the four points we have proposed.

	I. From the Perspective of Geological Evolution

The scope of this plan includes three major topographic regions: First, the West Siberian Lowland, which is the Ob River basin, bounded by the Ural Mountains to the west and the Yenisei River to the east. It is the Arctic Ocean water system that ends in the Arctic Ocean. Second, the Central Asian Lowland, a closed inland drainage basin centered on the Aral Sea. Third, the Turgai Plateau (also known as the highland, or a small area within the Central Asian Lowland) (Note 1) between the two, connected to the Kazakh Uplands to its east, forming the watershed between the two water systems.

The West Siberian Lowland is based on the solid crust of ancient crystalline rock formations and was submerged under the ocean for a long time until it rose to become land in the Quaternary period (approximately two million years ago). We need to know that after the Earth solidified, it took about two billion years to reach its current state (Note 2). This lowland only "emerged" two million years ago, which is very, very late in geological terms. Because it was submerged under the ocean for a long time, a very thick layer of sedimentary rock accumulated on top of its (ancient crust). Furthermore, because its foundation is solid, it was minimally affected by the several violent orogenic movements that occurred on Earth, hardly causing any major folding, fracturing, or faulting. Only slight vertical uplift and subsidence occurred due to land formation. Therefore, the sedimentary rock layers deposited on it remained mostly unchanged and nearly horizontal. Due to its low flatness, large-scale river cutting or weathering was also prevented, and it remains the most extensive and flat region on Earth today. The Ob River flows through it and is also one of the calmest of the world's top ten rivers. Going upstream 1,850 miles from its estuary, the altitude only increases by 308 feet, with an average elevation difference of only two inches per mile (Note 3). From this, we can imagine how low and flat the Siberian Lowland is.

The Central Asian Lowland mainly consists of Tertiary and post-Tertiary strata, with the Aral Sea at its center. It is connected to the lowlands of the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea and the southern half. Due to the dry climate, the river flow is also very small, so the topography has not been greatly eroded by rainwater and rivers. However, it is greatly affected by wind, which blows away the fine sand on the ground, forming deserts and many shifting sand dunes. Apart from the sand dunes, the terrain is extremely flat.

The surface of the Turgai Plateau is composed of eroded Tertiary and Quaternary horizontal sedimentary deposits. It rose higher during crustal movements, with a general elevation of just over 300 feet to over 600 feet above sea level. The watershed between the Turgai River and the Ubagan River is only about 300 feet high. It is not very difficult to build a canal here to connect these two rivers.

What relationship did the three regions mentioned above have in the past? Yes, the key point is that the distribution of land and sea on Earth was largely settled during the Quaternary period. However, something else happened: the climate suddenly cooled, and glaciers formed on the Earth's surface at high latitudes or on high mountains. These glaciers advanced and retreated four times. When they formed (glacial periods), the land was heavily loaded and subsided, and the sea level rose relatively. When they retreated (interglacial periods), the land load lightened and rose, and the sea level also shrank relatively. Because its advance and retreat had a great impact on the ground today. The far north of Siberia is one of the sources of glaciers (Note 4). When the glaciers advanced southward, they blocked the outlets of the Ob and Yenisei rivers, which could not discharge, and formed a large freshwater lake. The water was forced to find a way out to the south, flowing through Central Asia and into the Aral Sea and Caspian Sea floodplains. The current Turgai Plateau (also known as the corridor) was its passage (Note 5). At that time, although the Aral Sea and Caspian Sea regions were not directly covered by glaciers, they were also greatly affected. Due to the dramatic climate change, rainfall increased and evaporation decreased, and the water volume greatly increased, leading to flooding, which connected to the Black Sea to the west. The Caspian Sea and the Black Sea were originally part of the ancient Mediterranean Sea, including the current Mediterranean Sea, and separated in the Tertiary period. The Caspian Sea and the Black Sea completely separated at the end of the Tertiary flooding, but they were connected again when the water was high during the Ice Age.

	II. The Current Geographical Foundation

The northern part of the West Siberian Lowland consists of glaciers and recent marine deposits, the central part is a vast forest swamp, and the southern part is arid grassland. However, the climate is severely cold, and the freezing period lasts for a long time each year. When the river water in the south thaws, the middle and lower reaches are still sealed by solid ice, and the flooding further expands the scope of the swamp. Not only is forest development difficult, but even transportation is very difficult.

The Ob River flows through it, 3,200 miles long (Note 6). Its headwaters, the Katun River and the Biya River, both originate in the Altai Mountains. The Irtysh River, which originates in northern Xinjiang, China, is its largest tributary and receives the Ishim River and the Tobol River along the way before flowing into the Ob. The confluence is only 200 feet above sea level. After this, the Ob River becomes very powerful. The planned sluice is to be built after the confluence of the Irtysh and the Ob, which is why. The aforementioned Ubagan River is one of the upper reaches of the Tobol (Note 7). There are also many tributaries on the right bank of the Ob River, such as the Keti River, the Chulym River, etc., which originate close and have short flows and are not very important. However, the Chulym River is only six miles away from the Yenisei River.

If we look at the map of Siberia upside down (south at the top), there are two very striking things that look like big trees (a type of river): one "root" is the Ob River, and the other "root" is its "neighbor," the Yenisei River, 2,900 miles long. Geographers often use it as the boundary between the western lowland and the central plateau of Siberia. The Yenisei's branches are even more lush than its neighbor. Being so close, it is not a problem to divert water from it to the Ob River.

Since a canal can be opened in Turgai, a dam can be built on the Ob River, and water can be diverted from the Yenisei River, then a large amount of water flow will come, flowing towards the Aral Sea. However, the Aral Sea cannot accommodate such a large amount of water, and another way out must be found, otherwise the Central Asian desert will become a swamp again. Yes, that is the old channel where the Amu Darya (now a major river flowing into the Aral Sea) once flowed into the Caspian Sea. Ancient geographers believed that the Amu Darya once flowed into the Caspian Sea. Travelers of the Middle Ages also mentioned this fact in their writings. Obviously, it later changed direction and entered the Aral Sea. This theory was finally confirmed when a dry riverbed was discovered, running from the Sarygamysh Depression to the Caspian Sea. This is the famous Uzboy dry riverbed (Note 8). In the 16th century, it seems that water still flowed from the Amu Darya through Uzboy, but it had completely evaporated before reaching the Caspian Sea. In the 18th century, Peter the Great received this information and wanted to let the Amu Darya return to its old channel to reach the Caspian Sea in order to facilitate trade between Russia and the Central Asian Khanates. He sent a mission to negotiate, but this mission not only failed to complete its task but was also killed by the Khan (Note 9). Since then, the Amu Darya and the Uzboy dry valley have been studied by geographers, geologists, and topographers, and it has been fully confirmed.

If the plan is realized in the future and water flows from the Aral Sea to the Caspian Sea again, another major benefit can be obtained: the Caspian Sea loses three and a half feet of water each year due to evaporation (Note 10). The Volga River can only make up for 70 percent of this loss, and 19 percent is made up for by precipitation (Note 11). There is still a shortfall of 11 percent, which means that the threat of the Caspian Sea's water level declining day by day can be solved, and it may even rise as a result.

The Central Asian Lowland is located in the center of the Eurasian continent and has a very dry climate with extreme variations between winter and summer. The Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers flow into the Aral Sea. Places where water can be diverted for irrigation mostly turn into oases. In addition, there are many small rivers and lakes, but these small rivers do not go far before being swallowed by the desert. There is a local saying that "water stops there, and land ends there." There are three major deserts. The Kara-Kum Desert is between the Amu Darya and the Caspian Sea. The Kyzylkum Desert is between the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya. To the east of the Syr Darya is the Hungry Steppe. The soil in these deserts is very good. As long as there is water, it can be transformed into fertile oases.

Central Asia is one of the oldest irrigated agricultural regions. The age of the irrigation canals can be judged by the thickness of the soil layer, which is composed of sediment from the water in the irrigated fields and the fertilizers applied. It is estimated that, according to modern farming methods, the thickness of the soil layer increases by about one-thousandth of a meter (one millimeter) each year. In some irrigated oases, the soil layer is as thick as four meters (four thousand millimeters). That tells us that there has been four thousand years of irrigation history (Note 12).

	III. The Needs of Economic Development

The Kuznetsk coal mine on the southeastern edge of Western Siberia is the Soviet Union's largest coal reserve, five times larger than the Donets Basin, previously known as the "coal country," and two and a half times larger than the total coal reserves of the United Kingdom. It is estimated to be over 450 billion tons, 300 times the world's total annual coal consumption (Note 13). It has long been combined with the iron ore mines of Magnitogorsk through the Siberian Railway to form a large industrial complex. Coal and iron ore flow in opposite directions, making both places important steel industrial centers. Where the Siberian Railway intersects the Ob River and its tributaries, there are all emerging industrial cities or transportation hubs. The surrounding area is a vast expanse of farmland or pasture, a granary comparable to Ukraine (Note 14). Further north is nearly 100,000 square miles of forest, truly inexhaustible.

Speaking of the economic development of the Central Asian region, it must include the five Soviet Central Asian republics - Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Because this is a large economic zone, although it has its unity and particularity, from the perspective of the overall Soviet economic development plan, it is developing with the most suitable conditions, and there is absolutely no weakening of the geographical division of labor between regions.

Kazakhstan, in terms of area, ranks second only to the Russian SFSR among the sixteen Soviet republics. Its national economy was originally based on animal husbandry as the main sector. However, due to the discovery of many mineral deposits in recent years, industry has developed rapidly. During the Great Patriotic War, it became one of the Soviet Union's important arsenals. It has all kinds of minerals such as coal, iron, copper, lead, phosphorus, potassium, oil, chromium, and nickel. This situation is probably only matched by the Urals (Note 15). Due to the development of irrigation, agriculture has also risen accordingly. For example, although sugar beets are a new crop, they have broken the world record with a yield of 60 tons per hectare (Note 16).

Uzbekistan is located southwest of Kazakhstan. It possesses the Fergana Valley, the upper reaches of the Syr Darya, the oasis irrigated by the Zeravshan River, and the lower reaches of the Amu Darya. The total irrigated area is larger than the sum of the total irrigated area of the other four republics. Uzbekistan has achieved great success in cotton planting. Collectivization, mechanization, and irrigation projects combined have tripled annual cotton production compared to before the revolution. Before the revolution, about half of the cotton used by Russian factories was imported from abroad. Today, the cotton produced by the Soviet Union is self-sufficient, and Uzbekistan, which accounts for two-thirds of the national output, is a decisive factor (Note 17).

Tajikistan's territory is mostly on the "Roof of the World," the Pamir Plateau. Undoubtedly, it is a mountainous country, with many high valleys sandwiched between many parallel mountain ranges. Wheat fields and orchards have been opened on the slopes. Mountain pastures raise excellent sheep (Hissar Sheep) and horses (Lokai and Karabai breeds) famous throughout the Soviet Union. Irrigated mountain areas are planted with cotton, and long-staple Egyptian cotton is planted. The Vakhsh River, the largest tributary on the right bank of the Amu Darya, flows in its southwest. Great projects have been carried out in this valley. Now, a large area has been artificially irrigated and can be planted with cotton. This is Tajikistan's most fertile agricultural area. The population in the valley is rapidly increasing. A large number of mountain residents have come down from the Pamirs and settled in this valley.

Turkmenistan is the poorest of the Central Asian republics. Most of the area is occupied by the Kara-Kum Desert. However, it enjoys part of the middle and lower reaches of the Amu Darya. People try their best to use it to fight the desert, turning the desert into cotton fields; or using windmills to draw underground water to irrigate the land. This landscape has the flavor of a "desert Holland"; or digging deep ditches and planting grains and vegetables in the ditches. There are abundant salts on the Caspian coast in the western part of its territory, and there are oil reserves underground, which are now being mined in large quantities.

Kyrgyzstan is also a mountainous country, almost entirely occupied by the Tian Shan Mountains, and most of the area is high mountains with perennial snow cover. Because of its high terrain, it only enjoys the upper reaches of a few rivers. New irrigation systems have been built in the valleys, and new cash crops such as jute and sugar beets have been planted. The weaving and sugar-making industries have also risen with it. The wheat area is very large, and there is an annual surplus that is transported to other republics. Recently, coal has been discovered in its eastern part and has begun to be mined.

In short, the economic development of Western Siberia and Central Asia is progressing at a high speed, and both have clear prospects. However, the former needs how to manage the Ob River, control its flooding, and drain its swamps to promote agriculture and animal husbandry and develop forest resources. The latter urgently needs water. In Central Asia, every inch of land and every person is constantly engaged in fierce struggles with the desert to compete for water sources. As long as there is water, all problems can be solved. At the same time, the products of the two places are also urgently needed for exchange between each other. For example, Siberia's timber, grain, and farming machinery are coveted by Central Asia. Many economic crops and other industrial products of Central Asia are also yearned for by Siberia. For this reason, it is necessary to find new transportation routes. Obviously, the existing Turkestan-Siberia Railway or building another railway cannot fully meet the needs. If the plan to divert the Siberian rivers can be realized, then not only can the water problems of the two places (one has too much water, and one lacks water) be solved, but also materials can be exchanged. Furthermore, the speed of social development can be accelerated through further economic development. The progress of society can also improve the effectiveness of economic development.

	IV. The Nature of Social Organization

Marxist-Leninist science determines the following most important law, that is, as the socio-economic forms of human society transition from lower to higher levels, the speed of historical development also accelerates. History is created by human beings. The more actively people of new rising classes participate in transforming the existing world, the more they accelerate the development of history (Note 18).

The decisive factor in social development is the social mode of production. In order for society to survive, there must be labor tools and people who can use the tools. And this is what is called productive forces. Productive forces - this is not a gift of nature, but the result of the development of human society. Productive forces express the measure of mankind's power to control natural forces, and express mankind's relationship to natural objects. Productive forces express the relationship of people to the natural objects and forces that are used to produce material wealth. They are one aspect of social production. The other aspect of social production is the mutual relationships between people in the production process, the production relations of people.

The Soviet socialist state is the owner of the basic means of production, and in its hands, it holds all the economic levers to organize production and consumption. The socialist state, representing the interests of the whole people, is the conscious and planned basic force that determines the direction of the national economy towards communist development (Note 19).

A socialist society is unimaginable without planning. Its national economy needs planning just as people need the most urgent necessities of life. Lenin once said: "Without the planned state organization managing millions of people in the cause of production and distribution of products, strictly adhering to unified quotas, socialism is empty talk" (Note 20). The Soviet socialist plan is formulated on the basis of a scientific understanding of the laws of the socialist economy. It has enormous organizational and mobilizing power. It arms the builders of the new society with a clear vision and organizes the working masses to fight for the purpose of building communism. For example, in 1939-40, the farmers of the collective farms in Uzbekistan voluntarily excavated the Fergana Canal, one of the Soviet Union's largest irrigation projects, in an incredibly short period. The head section of the canal was about 170 miles long and was completed in six weeks. About 160,000 people participated in this work, which generated unparalleled enthusiasm.

"All problems are included in people," the Soviet people say, "As long as he is moving towards the desert or the Arctic in an organized, planned, and scientific way, he can turn it into a splendid garden and useful land." (Note 21)

Twenty years ago, the lives of the people of Central Asia were no different from those of the Timurid era or the Genghis Khan era. But since the establishment of Soviet power, in a short period of more than twenty years, they have walked a road that centuries could not walk.

Since the establishment of Soviet power, the face of the backward Russia on Earth has been fundamentally changed. Rivers have been changed; barren land has been changed into fertile land; underground resources have been developed; large cities and new factories have appeared in places previously sparsely populated. This unprecedented prosperity of human society - this is the product of the socialist era. Land, climate, resources, waterways, and the animal and plant kingdom - the entire natural world, under socialism, has begun to serve the workers, the entire people. The fundamental reason for this change is none other than the Soviet socialist organization (Note 22).

Summarizing the above analysis, our answer to this question is positive and affirmative.

From here, we are given a great enlightenment for the new China, which increases our infinite confidence in the future of nation-building. At present, the power of the new China has been grasped by the people themselves. They will not hesitate to follow the path taken by the Soviet Union and advance rapidly. They will mobilize a quarter of the world's human labor force, force nature to adapt to their own purposes, rule nature, and build a new China. They will shatter the old theories that "China is poor and its resources are exhausted," and "the land is large but the products are not abundant." On the contrary, they will bring unprecedented prosperity.

    苏联变中亚沙漠为绿洲的伟大
    改革和给予新中国建设的启示
    刘心务
    关于这个问题的回答，我们至少要从下列四点去看：即地质演变的根据；现有的地理基础；经济发展的需要；及社会组织的性质。前二者可说是自然环境所提供的可能性；后二者可说社会经济形态所造成的必要性。如果这样来分析的话，对于苏联这个改造自然的计划，或许可以得到进一步的了解。
    使西伯利亚的鄂毕、叶尼塞两大河流改道灌溉苏联中亚细亚沙漠区的计划，截至目前为止，仅看到两篇材料，一篇是十一月十九日人民日报所刊载的一则消息—苏联将鄂毕、叶尼塞两河改道，使中亚细亚沙漠变为肥田；一篇是十二月二十六日同报“苏联研究”副刊三十二期载有罗玛式科夫作海澄节译的“西伯利亚河流改道——苏联改造自然的伟大计划。”我们从这篇节译的文章里，才知道这个计划大概的轮廓。现在仅根据这已知的轮廓和我们所拟具的四点来讨论。
            一、从地质演变的根据来看
    这个计划所包括的范围，就大的地形区来讲有三：一、西部西伯利亚低地，即鄂毕河流域，西起乌拉山东麓，东以叶尼塞河为界。以北极洋为归宿的北极洋水系。二、中亚细亚低地，以咸海为中心的内陆流域水系。三、为介于前两者之间的土尔阶平原（亦称高原，或为中亚低地内之一小区）（注一），连其东面的卡萨克高地成为前两水系的分水岭。
    西部西伯利亚低地是立基于坚硬地壳的古老结晶岩构造上，长时期淹没于海洋之下，直到第四纪（约距今两百万年前）始上升为陆地。我们要知道，地球凝结以后，约经过二十万万年始达到今日之状态（注二）。此低地区于两百万年以前始露“头角”。这就地质年代讲是很晚很晚的事情了。因为它长期淹没于海洋之下，所以在它（古老地壳）的上面堆积了很厚的水成岩层。更因为它的基础坚硬，对于地球上所发生的几次剧烈造山运动影响很小，简直就没有引起大的褶曲、分裂、和断层等现象。仅因造陆运动而有稀微的垂直升降运动而已。所以沉积在它上面的水成岩层，多未变动而近于水平。由于它的低平又阻止了大规模的河流切割或风化作用，到现在仍为地球上面最广大最平坦的地区。鄂毕河流经其上，也是世界上十大河流中最平静的一个。由其河口上行一八五○英里，高度仅升高三○八英尺，平均每英里低差仅有两英寸（注三），由此我们便可想象西伯利亚低地是如何的低平啊。
    中亚细亚低地主要为第三纪和第三纪以后的地层，其中心为咸海。且与里海东岸南半部的低地相连。由于气候干燥，河流流量也很小，故其地形未受雨水及河流大的侵蚀作用。但受风力的作用很大，风力将地面上的细沙吹走，成功为沙漠及许多迁徙不定的沙丘，除沙丘外，地势极为平坦。
    土尔阶平原地面为曾经侵蚀过的第三纪和第四纪水平水成沉积。在地壳变动时上升较高，一般的拔海高度不过三百多英尺到六百多英尺。而土尔阶河与乌巴干河之分水岭高仅三百英尺左右。计划要在这里开筑运河沟通这两条河是没有多大困难的。
    上面所说的三个地区过去有个什么关系？有，发生的关键在那里？那就是第四纪时地球上水陆的分布大体已经底定；不过另有事情发生，就是气候骤然变冷，地球表面在高纬度地方，或地势很高的山上，发生了冰川，它进退共有四次之多。当其形成时（冰期）陆地负担重而降低，相对的海面随之扩大；当其后退时（间冰期）陆地荷重减轻而上升，相对的海面亦随着缩小。因为它的进退给予今日地面上的影响是很大的。西伯利亚极北为冰川发源地之一（注四），当冰川南侵阻塞了鄂毕、叶尼塞两河的出路，无法宣泄，便潴成一个大淡水湖，水被迫向南找出路，流经中亚注入咸海、里海泛滥区。现在的土尔阶平原（又称走廊）为其通道（注五）。那时候咸海、里海区虽未直接为冰川所覆盖，也受到很大的影响。因为气候的剧变，雨量增加而蒸发又减少，水量大增遂告泛滥，更向西和黑海相连。本来里海、黑海同为古地中海的一部，包括现在的地中海在内，到第三纪始分开。里海和黑海完全脱离关系是在第三泛末了，不过到冰期水大时又沟通。
            二、现在的地理基础
    西伯利亚低地北部为冰川及近代海洋沉积物，中部为广大的森林沼泽地，南部则为干旱的草原。唯气候严寒，每年冰冻时期很长。当其南面河水解冻，中下游尚为坚冰所封，因泛滥更加扩大沼泽的范围。不仅森林开发不易，连通行也非常困难。
    鄂毕河流贯其上，长三二○○英里（注六）。其正源卡顿河与比雅河都源出阿尔太山。源于我国新疆北部之伊尔齐斯河为其最大的支流，且于途中纳有伊什穆河与托波尔河，然后汇入鄂毕，会流处拔海仅二百英尺。此后鄂毕河便声势浩大，计划中之水闸拟修在伊尔齐斯与鄂毕交会以后的地方，也就是因为这个道理。前面所提到的乌巴干河便是托波尔上源之一支流（注七）。鄂毕河的右岸尚有许多支流。如开奇河，楚利木河等，皆源近流短，无甚重要，唯楚利木距叶尼塞河仅六英里。
    假如将西伯利亚地图倒置（南方在上）来看，很触目的有两根大树似的（是为河流类型的一种）东西，一“根”是鄂毕河，另一“根”就是它的“芳邻”叶尼塞河，长二千九百英里。地理学家常常以它为界分西伯利亚为西部低地与中部高原。叶尼塞的枝干之繁茂比乃邻有过之无不及。这样逼近，计划从它引水到鄂毕河是不成问题的。
    既然在土尔阶可以开运河，可以在鄂毕河筑堤坝，又可从叶尼塞河引水。那么大量的水流就来了，流向咸海、可是咸海是不能容受这样大的水量，须得另找出路，否则中亚沙漠又要变成泽国。有了，那就是从前阿姆河（现在为注入咸海的大河）曾经有一个时期流到里海的故道。旧时代的地理学家便认为阿姆河从前是流入里海的。中世纪的旅行家所写的东西，也提到了这一事实。显然是它后来改了方向，入了咸海。这理论终于证实了，发现了一道干涸的河床，由沙里卡密希低陷地通至里海。这是有名的乌兹波伊干河道（注八）。在十六世纪时，似乎还有水从阿姆河流经乌兹波伊，可是在到达里海之前就已完全蒸发完了。十八世纪时，彼得大帝得到这个情报，想让阿姆河回到它的故道通到里海，以便沟通俄国和中亚诸汗国之间的贸易。便派了使团去交涉，这个使团不但未能完成任务，而且全被汗王杀光了（注九）。此后，阿姆河与乌兹波伊干谷经地理学家、地质学家和地形学家加以研究，完全证实了。
    如果将来计划实现水从咸海又流到里海，可以得到另外一个大的收获：就是里海的水每年要蒸发掉三英尺半（注十）。这损失伏尔加河只能弥补它百分之七十，百分之十九为降水量所弥补了（注十一）。尚差百分之十一，就是说里海水面日形降低的威胁，可以获得解决，甚至可以因之升高。
    中亚低地因处于欧亚大陆的中心，气候很干燥，冬夏气候变异特大。有阿姆、锡尔两大河注入咸海，能引水灌溉的地方，多变为绿洲，此外尚分布有许多小河与小湖，那些小河走得不远便为沙漠所吞没。在当地流行一句俗语，“水止到那里，土就断到那里”。大沙漠有三，在阿姆河与里海之间叫做卡拉沙漠；位于阿姆、锡尔两河之间的为基悉尔沙漠；锡尔河的东面有一个饥饿沙漠。这些沙漠土质都是很好的，只要有水，便可变为肥美的绿洲。
    中亚是最古老的灌溉农业区之一，灌溉水道的古老，可由土层的厚度判断出来，这土层是由灌溉田野的水中底沉泥及所施的肥料所积成的。据估计，照现代的耕种方法，每年增加泥层厚度约为千分之一公尺（一厘），有些灌溉的绿洲中，其泥层厚达四公尺（四千厘）。那就是告诉我们已有四千年的灌溉历史了（注十二）。
            三、经济发展的需要
    西部西伯利亚的东南边缘上的库兹涅茨煤矿为苏联最大的煤藏区，五倍于以前号称“煤乡”的顿内茨，二倍半于英国的总煤藏量。据估计有四千五百亿吨以上，为现在全世界每年用煤总量的三百倍（注十二）。早已利用西伯利亚铁路与玛格尼托哥尔斯克之铁矿联合成为一个大工业组合。煤斤与铁砂对流，使两地都成为重要的钢铁工业中心。在西伯利亚铁路与鄂毕河及其支流交叉的地方全是新兴的工业城市或交通枢纽。四周则是一望无际的农田或牧场，这是与乌克兰齐名的谷仓（注十四）。往北走便是近十万方英里面积的森林，真是取之不尽，用之不竭。
    谈到中亚区的经济发展，要包括苏联中亚五个共和国——卡萨克、乌兹别克、塔吉克、土谷曼、和吉尔吉斯。因为这是一个大的经济区，虽有其统一性和特殊性，但就整个苏联经济发展的计划来看，是以最适合的条件去发展的，绝对没有削弱区与区之间在地理上的劳动分工。
    卡萨克就面积而论，在苏联十六共和国中仅次于苏俄而居第二。它的国民经济原本以畜牧为主要部门。但由于近年许多矿藏的发现，工业突飞猛进。在卫国战争期间已变为苏联重要兵工厂之一了。它有煤、铁、铜、铅、磷、钾、石油、铬、镍等各色各样的矿产，这情形恐怕只有乌拉尔能够与它匹敌（注十五）。因灌溉事业的发展，农业也随之兴起。如甜菜虽为其新作物，却以每公顷六十吨的收获量打破世界纪录（注十六）。
    乌兹别克位于卡萨克之西南。它拥有锡尔河上游——费尔干纳河谷，塞拉夫善河所灌溉的绿洲，及阿姆河下游。总共灌溉面积，比之其他四个共和国全部灌溉面积的总和还要大。在乌兹别克种植棉花已得到很大的成就。集体化、机械化、灌溉工作三种工程合起来，使每年棉产量为革命前的三倍。革命前俄国工厂所用的棉花，约莫一半是国外输入的；今天苏联所出产的棉花，已能自给自足，而在这出产量占全国三分之二的乌兹别克，是一个决定性的因素（注十七）。
    塔吉克的国土大部在“世界屋脊”帕米尔高原之上。无疑的它是一个山国，在许多平行山脉中夹有许多地势很高的河谷。就在山坡上辟有麦田和果园。山地牧场畜有全苏著名的优良羊群（Hissar Sheep）和马（Lokai种和Karabai种）。能灌溉的山地则种了棉花，而且种的是长纤维的埃及棉种。在它国境西南流着一条瓦赫希，是阿姆右岸最大的支流，在这河谷中曾进行了伟大的工程，现在已有很大的一片面积经过人工灌溉，且可种棉花了。这是塔吉克最丰饶的农耕区。河谷人口正在迅速的增加；大量的山间居民，已由帕米尔走下来，定居在这河谷上。
    土谷曼是中亚诸共和国中最贫瘠的一个。大部分地方是给卡拉沙漠占据了。然而它享有阿姆河的中游及下游的一部，人们便尽量利用它与沙漠搏斗，将沙漠变成棉田；或用风车吸取地下水源来浇地，这种景观有“沙漠荷兰”的风味；或掘成深沟，在深沟里种植谷物和菜蔬。在其国境的西部里海沿岸有丰富的盐类，地下蕴藏有石油，现都大量开采。
    吉尔吉斯也是一个山国，几全给天山占据了，而且大部地方是终年积雪的高山。因为它的地势高，仅享有几条河流的上源，在河谷里筑了新的灌溉系统，种有新的经济作物，如粗麻、甜菜。织麻、制糖的工业也伴着起来。小麦面积很大，年有余产运到其他诸共和国。在它的东部最近发现了煤块，亦已开始采掘。
    总之西部西伯利亚和中亚细亚的经济发展，都在高速度的进展，都有鲜明的远景。不过前者是需要如何整治鄂毕河，控制其泛滥，排除其沼泽的水，以便推广农牧，开发森林富源。后者是如何迫切地需要着水，在中亚每一寸土每一个人时时刻刻为争取水源与沙漠进行剧烈的斗争。只要有水什么问题都可迎刃而解。同时两地的出产，也是彼此之间所急需交换的。比如西伯利亚的木材、粮食与耕种机器是中亚所渴望的。中亚许多经济作物和其他工业产品又是西伯利亚所向往的。为此必须另谋交通路线的开辟，显然现有的土西铁路或另筑铁路都是无法全部胜任的。如果西伯利亚河流改道计划能实现的话，则不仅两地水的问题（一多水、一缺水）可以解决，物资也可交流了。更可因进一步的经济开拓加速社会发展的速度；社会的进展，又可提高经济发展的效力。
            四、社会组织的性质
    马列主义科学确定下列最重要的法则，即随着人类社会经济形态由低级过渡到高级，历史发展的速度也就加快。历史是由人类创造的。新的上升阶级的人们，愈是积极参加改造现存世界，则愈加速历史的发展（注十八）。
    社会发展的决定因素是社会生产方式。为要使社会能够生存，必需要有劳动工具和能够使用工具的人。而这便是所谓生产力。生产力——这不是自然的赐予物，而是人类社会发展的结果。生产力表现人类驾驶自然力的权能的尺度，表现人类对于自然对象的关系。生产力是表现着人们对于被利用来生产物质财富的自然对象和自然力的关系。它们是社会生产的一方面。社会生产的另一方面便是人们在生产过程中的相互关系，人们的生产关系。
    苏维埃社会主义国家是基本生产手段的所有者，在他手里掌握着一切经济杠杆来组织生产和消费。代表全民利益的社会主义国家是有意识的有计划的决定全国经济向共产主义发展的基本力量（注十九）。
    社会主义社会离开计划是不可想象的。其国民经济之需要计划，如同人们之需要最迫切的生活必需品一样。列宁曾说过：“如果没有计划的国家的组织管理千百万人民在生产和生产品的分配的事业中严格的遵守统一的定额，社会主义则是空谈”（注二十）。苏联社会主义计划是在科学的了解社会主义经济法则的基础上制定的，它有巨大的组织和动员的力量，它以鲜明的远景武装新社会的建国者，并组织劳动大众为达到建设共产主义目的而斗争。例如一九三九至四○年，乌兹别克集体农场的农民自动在不能相信的短时期内开掘了费尔干纳运河，这是苏联最大的灌溉工程之一。运河头一段长约一百七十英里，在六星期内完成。约莫有十六万人参加这一工作，这产生了一种无可比拟的热诚。
    “一切问题都包括在人的身上，”苏联人民说，“只要他在一种有组织的，有计划的，和科学的方法上向沙漠或北极前进的时候，他就可以把它变成一个绚烂的花园和有用的土地。”（注二十一）
    二十余年前中亚人民的生活和铁木儿时代或成吉思汗时代差不了多少。但自苏维埃政权建立以来，短短的二十余年的历史走了过去多少世纪所不能走的路。
    自从苏维埃政权建立以来，根本改变了落后的俄国所处的地球的面貌。河流被改变了；荒地被改变成肥土了；地下富藏被开发出来了；以前人迹罕至的地方，出现了大城市和新工厂。这种人类社会空前的繁荣——这便是社会主义时代的产物。土地、气候、富藏、水道和动植物界——全部自然界，在社会主义之下，都开始为劳动者，为全体人民服务了。这个改变的基本原因，不是别的，而是苏联的社会主义组织（注二十二）。
    总结以上的分析，我们对于这个问题的答案是正面的，是肯定的。
    从这里给予我们新中国一个很大的启示，对于建国前途增加了无限的信心。目前新中国的政权已掌握在人民自己手里。他们将毫不迟疑的循着苏联所走的道路飞步前进。他们将要动员占全世界四分之一的人类劳动力，迫使自然来适应自己的目的，统治着自然，来建设新中国。他们将要粉碎以前“中国民穷财尽”、“地大而物不博”的陈腐理论。相反的他们将要带来空前的繁荣。
