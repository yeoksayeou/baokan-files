    Hebei Inspects Work Throughout the Province
    Provincial Government Forms Inspection Group of Over 150 People to Go to Various Regions to Investigate and Research to Improve Work Style
    [This newspaper's Hebei dispatch] In order to implement the "Decision on Truly and Thoroughly Inspecting Work" of the Second Meeting of the Hebei Provincial Government Committee, the Hebei Provincial Government has organized a work inspection group to go to various regions to inspect work. The "Decision on Truly and Thoroughly Inspecting Work" of the Second Meeting of the Provincial Government Committee stated: "A major shortcoming exists to varying degrees and is quite prevalent in our work, namely, that inspection work is extremely unrealistic and extremely superficial. As a result, serious phenomena such as violations of policies and laws and damage to state property, which are irresponsible to the people, have long existed in many areas… As for the bureaucratic style of perfunctoriness and procrastination, carelessness, being busy with affairs, and lacking implementation, it is even more common and serious. If we do not resolutely overcome this in the future, our work will not be able to move forward!" Chairman Yang Xiufeng, at the joint office meeting of the Provincial Government and the evening meeting of all organ personnel, emphasized: In 1950, we must improve our work style, transform the phenomenon of work fatigue and mediocrity, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against all bureaucratic phenomena of not investigating or researching, not going deep into the lower levels, not understanding the actual situation, not caring about the people's lives, and not being responsible for the people's and the state's wealth. Therefore, inspection work must be carried out throughout the year. In order to implement the decisions of the Provincial Government Committee meeting and Chairman Yang's instructions, in addition to dispatching four groups mainly from the Industry Department in early December to inspect ten factories and mines, inspection groups were organized separately by various departments before and after the New Year, and were unified into special and municipal inspection groups to go to various regions to inspect work. Thirteen departments alone, including Civil Affairs, Education, Commerce, Public Security, Health, Courts, Supervision, Transportation, Labor, Banks, Cooperatives, Taxation, and Grain, have drawn 159 cadres to go to ten special districts and four cities to inspect work.
    In order to unify the spirit of inspection work, two meetings of responsible personnel of each inspection group were held on the 6th and 9th, where Director Li Jihuan of the Civil Affairs Department, among others, conveyed Chairman Yang's instructions. Finally, it was proposed that: 1. Inspection work must be carried out throughout the year 1950. This is a central link in rectifying political discipline and improving work style. Its purpose is to understand the situation, discover problems, solve problems, and promote work. 2. Inspection work must be well integrated with local organizations and local cadres and the masses to assist them in carrying out their work. It should neither be done for them nor simply understood without providing assistance and making suggestions. The work of various regions should first be viewed in terms of its achievements, and at the same time, shortcomings should also be inspected and corrected, striving to avoid the one-sided view of only seeing shortcomings and neglecting advantages. In terms of style and attitude, one should be humble, practical, and simple, learn, study, and understand more, exchange opinions with local cadres more, be enthusiastic and calm, and avoid the two tendencies of rashly criticizing without consideration and not mentioning problems even when seeing them; go deep into districts and villages, get close to the masses, and have evidence and figures to understand problems; do not just stay in organs and among cadres, copying materials and listening to reports. In the inspection work, it is also necessary to absorb experience and improve oneself, and everyone must have gains. 3. The issue of combining central work and departmental work. The organization, regions, time, and content of this trip are basically the plans of the various departments themselves, and the leadership has not changed them; however, in addition to inspecting their own work, all personnel must inspect production and disaster relief, and must proceed from a comprehensive perspective and not just look at the work of their own unit. They must understand production from understanding departmental work, and promote the work of various departments from promoting central work. Doing so does not weaken departmental work, but rather carries out departmental work in a more systematic and focused manner. 4. The organizational form of the inspection group is both decentralized to various regions and departments, and each region has a unified organization and leadership, organic coordination and connection, and facilitates work. The various groups within a special district should have more contact, exchange information, and report problems to the Provincial Government at any time, without delaying time or missing opportunities.

    河北检查全省工作
    省府已组成百五十余人的检查团分赴各地调查研究改进工作作风
    【本报河北消息】为了贯彻省府委员会第二次会议“关于切实深入检查工作的决定”，河北省府组织了工作检查团，分赴各地检查工作。省府委员会第二次会议“关于切实深入检查工作的决定”中说：“我们工作程度不同和相当普遍地存在着一个主要缺点，就是检查工作极不切实，极不深入，因而不少地区长期存在着违反政策法令及损害国家资财等对人民不负责任的严重现象。……至于潦草拖延，粗枝大叶，忙于事务，缺乏贯彻的官僚主义作风，则更为普遍而严重。今后如不痛下决心大力克服，我们的工作将不可能前进！”杨秀峰主席在省府联合办公及全体机关人员晚会上，都曾强调提出：在一九五○年，要改进我们的工作作风，转变工作疲塌、平淡现象，向一切不调查不研究、不深入下层、不了解实际情况，对人民生活不关心，对人民国家财富不负责任的官僚主义现象进行不调和的斗争，因而，检查工作要贯彻全年。为贯彻省府委员会议决定及杨主席指示精神，除于十二月初以工业厅为主派出四个小组进行了十个工厂、矿山的检查外，并于新年前后，各部门分别组织了检查小组，统一组成专、市检查团，分赴各地检查工作。仅民政、教育、商业、公安、卫生、法院、监察、交通、劳动、银行、合作、税务、粮食等十三部门，即抽出干部一百五十九人，分赴十个专区四个市检查工作。
    为统一检查工作的精神，于六、九两日召开了两次各检查小组负责人员会议，由民政厅李济寰厅长等传达了杨主席的指示，最后提出：一、检查工作，要贯彻在一九五○年全年，这是整顿政纪，改良作风的中心环节。它的目的是在于了解情况，发现问题，解决问题，推进工作。二、检查工作必须与当地组织和当地干部、群众很好地结合，协助其进行工作，既不应包办代替，也不是单纯了解而不加以帮助和提出意见。对各地工作应首先看成绩，同时也要检查缺点，帮助其进行纠正，力戒只看见缺点而忽视了优点的片面看法。在作风和态度上，应是谦虚，切实，朴素，多了解、研究和学习，多和当地干部交换意见，热肠冷脑，避免不加考虑的乱加批评和看到问题也不提的两种偏向；深入区村，接近群众，了解问题要有根据，有数字；不要只停留在机关和干部中，抄抄材料听听汇报了事。在检查工作中，还要吸取经验，提高自己，每个人要有收获。三、中心工作和部门工作的结合问题。这次下去的组织、地区、时间、内容，基本上是各部门自己的计划，领导上没有变更；但是，除检查自己的工作以外，所有人员都要检查生产救灾，要从全面出发，不能只看自己一个单位的工作，从了解部门工作中了解生产，并从推动中心工作中推动各部门工作。这样做，不是削弱部门工作，而是更加有系统、有中心地来进行部门工作。四、检查团的组织形式，既是分散地到各地区、各部门，而每个地区又有统一的组织和领导，有机的配合联系，便利工作。一个专区内的各小组要多联系，互通情报；并要随时发现问题向省府汇报，不要耽延时间，误时误事。
