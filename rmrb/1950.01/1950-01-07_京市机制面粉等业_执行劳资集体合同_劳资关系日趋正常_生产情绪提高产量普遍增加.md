    Beijing Municipal Mechanized Flour and Other Industries
    Implement Labor-Capital Collective Contracts
    Labor-Capital Relations Are Increasingly Normalized
    Production Enthusiasm Increases; Output Universally Increases

[This newspaper report] In Beijing, among the private industrial and commercial enterprises that have signed labor-capital collective contracts, such as the Chinese medicine industry, the night soil collection industry, the construction industry, the mechanized flour industry, and the weaving and dyeing industry, labor-capital disputes have been significantly reduced, except in special circumstances. In some industries, such as the mechanized flour industry, production has further developed due to the improvement of labor-capital relations. Although some employers do not abide by the contract, pay wages less, or dismiss workers without justification, or the labor side has unreasonable demands that cause labor-capital disputes, these can be successfully and quickly mediated based on the collective contract, or fairly arbitrated and resolved by the Labor Bureau based on the specific circumstances. From the time the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau was established in June of last year to December 15th, it received a total of 295 labor-capital dispute cases, of which 245 have been processed. The 50 unresolved cases mostly involve labor-capital disputes that occurred in industries that have not signed collective contracts.

The Chinese medicine industry, the first in the city to sign a collective contract, has only had three labor-capital disputes since the contract was signed, all of which were appropriately resolved by the Labor Bureau in accordance with the collective contract. For example, an employee of the Zhenxing Pharmacy was injured on official business in Qingdao. After mediation by the Labor Bureau, the pharmacy was responsible for the cost of recuperation. Also, a relative of the manager of the Pushan Tang Pharmacy lived idly in the shop and sometimes helped with some small tasks at the counter, but was not a formal shop assistant. When he left, he asked the shop for wages, which caused a dispute. After mediation by the Labor Bureau, it was decided that he should not be paid wages because he was not a shop assistant or worker.

Construction Industry Signing of Contract Improves Workers' Lives; Employers Still Profit

Before the signing of the collective contract in the construction industry, construction workers were severely exploited by various construction companies in order to survive, and there was no fixed standard for wages. After a construction company contracted a project, it would find construction workers through "foremen" at the "labor market," forming a special form of exploitation and arbitrarily reducing wages. After the collective contract stipulated fixed wages for skilled and unskilled workers, the unclear issues of the past were resolved, workers' treatment was improved, and employers could still profit. However, some construction company employers still exploited workers by taking advantage of loopholes, or delaying wage payments, or not paying according to the rice price on the day of wage payment, but according to the rice price on the day of work, or deliberately lowering the rice price instead of paying according to the actual rice price of the day. As a result, the workers' labor could not get the due price, and labor-capital disputes occurred. For example, the Yihe Gong Construction Company took advantage of price fluctuations to not pay wages according to the rice price on the day of wage payment, which caused a dispute with the workers. After mediation by the Labor Bureau, the wages were paid according to the number stipulated in the contract and the rice price published in the People's Daily on that day. Also, during the construction project of the Dongkuang Mine in Kou'er Village, Fangshan County, a construction worker was injured while working, and the employer refused to pay medical expenses. The Labor Bureau made an appropriate resolution based on the provisions of the "injury and death compensation" item in the collective contract.

After the collective contract in the night soil collection industry was established, workers' lives were improved, and employers no longer dared to have the feudal exploitation and barbaric attitude towards workers as in the past. Although workers' wages increased from 150 catties of corn per month to 350 catties of corn, employers could still obtain more than 50% profit. Labor-capital relations are gradually becoming normal, and therefore no serious labor-capital disputes have occurred.

Generally, the mechanized flour industry's flour mills have implemented the collective contract, and labor-capital relations are trending towards standardization. All unreasonable phenomena in wage treatment, working hours, holidays, and other welfare matters have been basically resolved. The production enthusiasm of both labor and capital has been improved, and most factories have generally increased output. For example, the Dejuyong Flour Mill, through the efforts of technicians and workers, improved the flour machine, increasing the factory's daily output from 700 bags to 850 bags. The Weiyi Flour Mill produced 25,000 bags of flour in October, and although it repaired the machine for a few days in November, it still managed to increase production to 28,000 bags. Fuxing, Tianzeng, Zhixiang, Yishun, Jiang Xintai and other factories are all adding machines and expanding factory buildings. The wages of each factory have also been adjusted, and those lower than the contract provisions have been increased, and the tendency of egalitarian wages adopted by some factories after liberation has been corrected. Workers' welfare has also been improved. For example, Weiyi, Fuxing and other factories have bathhouses, barbers, and entrusted Chinese and Western medicine for the treatment of diseases.

The collective contract in the weaving and dyeing industry has just been established. Because the Huasha Cloth Company suspended lending yarn and exchanging cloth for yarn, some factories with small capital have temporarily suspended work, and labor-capital disputes have increased accordingly. From the beginning of November to December 7, the Labor Bureau received a total of 13 labor-capital disputes in the weaving and dyeing industry. However, with the labor-capital collective contract as a basis, the disputes are not difficult to resolve, and 10 of the 13 cases have been resolved. For example, the Lianyin Weaving and Dyeing Factory, due to its small capital, had to temporarily suspend work after the Huasha Cloth Company stopped lending yarn. The employer used the suspension of work as an excuse not to pay wages, which caused a labor-capital dispute. After the Labor Bureau mediated according to the provisions of the contract and the specific circumstances, workers were paid 40% of their wages during the suspension period, apprentices were paid 50%, cooks and catering staff were paid in full, and three workers who were not active in production left their jobs. The Huasha Cloth Company lent another six pieces of yarn, the employer raised two pieces of yarn on its own, and has continued to start work and production.

    When Concluding Collective Contracts, Labor and Capital Must Be Mobilized to Fully Negotiate and Discuss Thoroughly

Based on the above situation, it proves that concluding a collective contract is the correct way to improve labor-capital relations and restore and develop production. However, when concluding a collective contract, both labor and capital must be mobilized to fully and democratically negotiate. From the brewing, drafting, research, discussion to the signing of the contract, the representatives of both parties and all employees and owners must repeatedly and thoroughly discuss and study item by item, and carefully deliberate. In particular, do not be impatient and let the Labor Bureau and the General Trade Union take over and replace it, or in a mandatory manner, so as not to become a mere formality and affect the difficulty of implementing the contract after it is signed. Beijing's Chinese medicine industry, night soil collection industry, construction industry, flour industry, and weaving and dyeing industry have basically achieved self-discussion and item-by-item research by both labor and capital when signing collective contracts, and this is the reason for today's achievements. However, before signing a collective contract, a more in-depth investigation and understanding of the industry rules, habits and special circumstances of each industry should be carried out, and the needs of small-scale factories should be taken into account, otherwise loopholes are likely to occur after the contract is signed, which will affect the implementation of the contract. For example, the collective contract of the construction industry does not stipulate the status of the "foreman." In fact, every construction project cannot do without the "foreman." After a construction company contracts a project, it must first find a "foreman," and then the "foreman" finds workers. The "foreman" actually becomes the agent of the construction company owner (employer), and is undoubtedly the employer for the construction workers. However, foremen often use the excuse of "non-employer" not to implement the provisions of the collective contract for workers, which often easily causes disputes.

    京市机制面粉等业
    执行劳资集体合同
    劳资关系日趋正常       
    生产情绪提高产量普遍增加
    【本报讯】京市各私营工商业中已签订劳资集体合同之国药业、粪业、建筑业、机制面粉业和织染业等行业中，除有特殊情况者外，劳资纠纷已显著减少。有的行业如机制面粉业，因劳资关系的改善，生产更获得了发展。虽有的资方不遵守合同，少发工资或无理解雇工人，或劳方有不合理的要求而发生劳资纠纷，因有集体合同为根据，都能很顺利迅速地调解成功，或由劳动局依具体情况公平仲裁解决。京市劳动局自去年六月成立迄十二月十五日止，共收到劳资纠纷案件二九五件，已处理二百四十五件。其未处理完毕的五十件大部属于未签订集体合同之行业中发生的劳资纠纷。
    全市第一个签订集体合同的国药业自签订合同以来，只发生了三件劳资纠纷，均经劳动局依集体合同作适当的解决。如振兴药房的一个职员因公赴青岛，在青因公受伤，经劳动局调解养伤费由药房负担。又如普善堂药房经理的一个亲戚在铺内住闲，有时虽也帮助柜上做一点小事，但并不是正式店员。当他离开时向柜上要工资发生纠纷。经劳动局调解，因其非店员和工人，即不应发与工资。
    建筑业签订合同后  工人生活得到改善  资方仍有利可图
    建筑业在签订集体合同前，建筑工人为了生活，曾受各营造厂的严重剥削，工资根本没有一定的标准。营造厂包下一件工程后，就通过“工头”到“人市”上找建筑工人，形成一种特殊形式的剥削，任意压低工资。俟集体合同规定大工小工的一定工资后，过去一些纠缠不清的问题乃告解决，工人待遇得到改善，资方仍有利可图。惟仍有若干营造厂资方取巧剥削工人的情形发生，或晚发工资，不按发工资当日的米价，而按做工当日的米价发给，或故意不按当日的实际米价发工资，而将米价压低。致工人之劳动不能得到应得的代价，劳资纠纷因之发生。如义合公营造厂就利用了物价波动的机会，不按发工资当日的米价发给工资，与工人发生纠纷。经劳动局调解，工资依合同规定之数目，按当日人民日报公布之米价发给。又如房山县口儿村东矿修建工程，一个建筑工人正在工作时受伤，资方不负担医药费。经劳动局根据集体合同中“伤亡抚恤”一项中的规定作了适当解决。
    粪业集体合同订立以后，工人生活得到了改善，资方已不敢再有像过去对工人封建剥削和野蛮态度。工人工资虽由每月一百五十斤玉米提高到三百五十斤玉米，但资方仍可获百分之五十以上的利润。劳资关系渐趋正常，因之未发生较严重的劳资纠纷。
    机制面粉业各面粉厂一般地均已执行了集体合同，劳资关系趋向正规。工资待遇，工时，假日及其他福利等事项中一切不合理现象基本上已获解决。劳资双方生产情绪提高，大部工厂普遍增加了产量。如德聚永面粉厂，经技师和工人的努力，改良了面粉机。使该厂日产七百袋增加到八百五十袋。唯一面粉厂十月份产面二万五千袋，十一月份虽然修了几天机器，仍能增产到二万八千袋。福兴、天增、致祥、益顺、降新泰等厂都在增添机器，扩充厂房。各厂的工资也都加以调整，低于合同规定的均予提高，并且纠正了解放后部分厂子采平均主义工资的偏向。工人的福利也都改善了。如唯一、福兴等厂都有浴堂、理发及委托中西医治疗疾病。
    织染业集体合同刚订立不久，因为花纱布公司暂停贷纱和以纱换布，部分资金小的工厂暂时停了工，劳资纠纷随之增多。由十一月初迄十二月七日，劳动局共收到十三件织染业的劳资纠纷。但有了劳资集体合同为根据，因之纠纷即不难解决，十三件中已处理完了十件。如联营织染工厂因资金小，花纱布公司停止贷纱后，资方不积极设法，不得不暂时停工。资方借停工为由不发工资，发生了劳资纠纷。经劳动局依合同之规定及具体情况加以调解，停工期间的工资，工人按百分之四十，学徒按百分之五十发给，厨工及伙食员工资全数照发，生产不积极的三个工人离职。花纱布公司再贷与六件纱，资方自行筹措两件纱，已继续开工生产。
      订立集体合同时必须发动劳资双方充分协商周密讨论
    根据以上情况，证明订立集体合同是改善劳资关系，恢复与发展生产的正确途径。但在订立集体合同时，必须发动劳资双方充分民主协商，从酝酿、起草、研究、讨论到合同的签订，都要经过双方代表和全体职工业主的反复周密讨论和逐条研究，详细斟酌。尤不能犯急性病，由劳动局、总工会包办代替或出于命令方式，以免流于形式，影响合同签订后不易执行。北京国药业，粪业，建筑业，面粉业，织染业在签订集体合同时，基本上都已作到了由劳资双方自行讨论逐条研究，而始有今日之成绩。但在签订集体合同前，应更深入地考察了解各行业的行规、习惯和特殊情况，并应照顾到规模小的工厂，否则签订合同后很可能发生漏洞，影响合同之执行。例如建筑业的集体合同中未规定“工头”的地位，实际每一项建筑工程都少不了“工头”；营造厂包下一件工程后，首先要找“工头”，再由“工头”找工人，“工头”实际成为营造厂主（资方）的代理人，对建筑工人言当系资方无疑。但工头往往以“非资方”为借口，对工人不执行集体合同之规定，因之常易引起纠纷。
