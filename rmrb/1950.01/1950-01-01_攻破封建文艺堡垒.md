    Breaking Through the Bastion of Feudal Literature and Art
    Wang Yaping
    It truly isn't easy to create works that the people can understand, enjoy, and be educated by.

    This is because too few of our workers, peasants, and soldiers can write their own works to express their lives, thoughts, and emotions. And too few intellectuals have truly mastered the language of the people. When they've learned just a little or only part of it, writing becomes a real struggle.

    At the same time, due to the rapid development of the situation, the people, after a long period of struggle, have enriched their knowledge of production, warfare, and life, and they are eagerly demanding to sing new songs, perform new plays, read new novels, listen to new ballads, and see new paintings. Under the needs of such a situation and task, and the current cultural level of the people, the question of whether works are understandable arises; are they too high-level? Too low-level? How to further examine creation and mobilize creation are issues that need to be addressed.

    The question of understanding should be the main issue in mass literature and art creation, because if it is written for the people to see and hear, then it must first be something they can understand. This does not limit any particular form. Whether it's scripts, novels, poems, lyrics, clapper talk, songs, or old forms like "Three Character Classic," "Lotus Drop," "Ten Branches of Flowers," "Following Heaven's Tour" etc., with new content added, they still have a certain degree of significance and function today. This is because the people need diverse forms, and expressing the current great and rich reality also requires diverse forms. The different cultural levels and creative targets of the people determine that forms should develop even more diversely. For example, when the Fourth Field Army summarized the literary and artistic work of the troops, the "People's Warrior Three Character Classic" was the most popular and tens of thousands of copies were printed, playing a significant role among the soldiers. Beijing, Northeast China, Qingdao, Tianjin, Wuhan, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places have launched drama and Quyi reform work, creating many scripts and drum lyrics, and constantly broadcasting and performing them. Many artists, new and old writers, workers, students, and staff have participated in this writing. However, as the direction of literary and artistic creation, we should make more efforts to learn how to create images of workers, peasants, soldiers, and their cadres. Because these figures, and the events and social life that happen around them every day, are creating a new chapter in the liberation history, struggle history, and construction history of the Chinese people. It is difficult to give full play to the ideological nature and the positivity of the theme of literary and artistic works if one deviates from these figures, events, and life. It is of course difficult to create typical progressive characters who promote history, to educate the masses and promote the progress of social production. If you are not familiar with them, don't understand them, it's not easy to write well, and if you don't write well, there will inevitably be a lot of criticism. We must be good at seeking improvement through serious criticism. If we can get help from authors with writing skills and experience, we will see the emergence of progressive heroes who promote the history faster and better.

    We must strive to write about workers, and write about workers seriously. The seedlings of factory literature and art have just sprouted. We cherish them, cultivate them, help them grow and develop.

    攻破封建文艺堡垒
    王亚平  
    作品写得使人民大众能懂，懂了又喜爱，喜爱了又能起到教育作用，那确确实实是一件不容易办到的事。
    因为，我们的工农兵大众，自己能写作品以表达自己的生活、思想、情感的还实在太少。知识分子对于人民大众的语言学到家的又实在不多，学了一点点，或学了一部分，写起作品来，就真有点费劲。
    同时，由于形势迅速地发展，人民大众经过了长期的斗争，更丰富了他们的生产知识、战争知识、生活知识，也就迫切地要求唱新歌曲、演新剧本、读新小说、听新唱词、看新画等等。在这样的形势任务需要底下，人民大众文化水平现状下，就产生了作品的懂不懂问题；高了呢？低了呢？如何进一步检查创作、发动创作等问题。
    关于懂不懂问题，应该是大众文艺创作的主要问题，因为既然写给人民大众去看、去听，那就首先要叫他们能看懂，能听懂。这里并不限定某种形式，剧本、小说、诗歌、唱词、快板、歌曲、以及其他“三字经”“莲花落”“十枝花”“顺天游”等旧形式加以新内容，在今天都还有它一定程度的意义与作用。因为人民大众是需要多样的形式，表现当前伟大丰富的现实也需要多样的形式，人民大众的文化水平不同、创作对象不同，也就决定了形式更该多样发展。比如，四野战军总结部队文艺工作时，“人民战士三字经”最受欢迎，而且印了几十万册，在战士中起了很大的作用；北京、东北、青岛、天津、武汉、南京、上海等地都展开了戏剧、曲艺改革工作，创作了不少剧本、鼓词，不断地做了广播、演唱，许多艺人、新旧作家、工人、学生、职员都参加了这一写作。但作为文艺创作的方向，应该多多的努力学习创作工农兵及其干部的形象。因为这些人物，以及围绕这些人物日常所发生的事件、社会生活正在创作新中国人民的解放史、斗争史、建设史。离开这些人物、事件、生活，很难发挥文艺作品的思想性、主题的积极性等等。努力描写推动历史前进的英雄人物来教育群众，推动社会生产前进，当然创造前进人物的典型是困难的，不熟习、不了解、不容易写好，而写的不好难免有很多责难。要善于在严肃的批评中求得改进。如果得到有写作修养，有经验的作者帮助，创作推动历史前进的英雄人物会出现得更快更好。
    我们要努力写工人，认真写工人。工厂文艺的幼芽初生了，我们爱护它，培植它、帮助它、生长、发展。
