[Beijing News] Shuang Deli, a local tyrant landlord from Xiaohongmen Village, District 14, Beijing, was accused by the village's peasants. After being handed over to the Beijing People's Court, the trial has now concluded, and the criminal has been sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. Shuang Deli, also known as Shuang Jianzhang, served as a puppet Bao trưởng (village head) for twelve years before the liberation of Beijing. He colluded with Japanese invaders and Kuomintang reactionaries and joined a special agent organization, specializing in oppressing peasants, forcibly conscripting men, forcibly buying land, embezzling and extorting money, and causing death. His crimes were numerous. On September 13th of last year, twelve peasant representatives from the village formally filed a complaint with the Beijing People's Court, and the court held a trial on November 8th of last year. During the trial, Shuang Deli continued to deny and refused to confess his guilt in every possible way. After the peasants of the village and the family members of the victims recounted the experience of the victims and multiple people including peasant Zhou Shan testified, the criminal had nothing to say in response. The Beijing People's Court, considering Shuang Deli's cruelty to the peasants, should be given long-term labor education to reform him, and therefore sentenced the criminal to fifteen years of imprisonment.

    恶霸地主双德立谋财害命判处徒刑十五年
    【北京讯】京市十四区小红门村恶霸地主双德立被该村农民控诉，移交京市人民法院后，现已审理终结，判处该犯徒刑十五年。双德立又名双建章，在北京解放前，历任伪保长达十二年之久。他曾勾结日寇及国民党反动势力，并加入特务组织，专事欺压农民。强抓壮丁，强买土地，贪污敲诈，逼死人命等。罪行累累。去年九月十三日，该村农民代表十二人向京市人民法院正式提起申诉，法院于去年十一月八日开庭审判。在审理期间双德立仍百般狡赖，不肯坦白认罪。经该村农民与被害人家属陈述被害经过及农民周善等多人作证后，该犯始无言可对。京市人民法院以双德立残害农民为恶一方，自应给予长期劳动教育，以资改造，遂判处该犯徒刑十五年。
