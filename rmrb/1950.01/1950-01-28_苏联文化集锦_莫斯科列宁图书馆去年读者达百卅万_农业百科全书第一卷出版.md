    Soviet Cultural Highlights
    Moscow Lenin Library Attracts 1.3 Million Readers Last Year
    First Volume of Encyclopedia of Agriculture Published
    The Moscow State Lenin Library, the world's largest library, attracted a total of 1.3 million readers last year (826,000 in 1940). The number of books borrowed daily is 20,000. It now holds 13.5 million books and periodicals, 150,000 rare books, and 2.5 million pages of manuscripts.
    Last year, Soviet trade unions established 2,150 libraries in cultural palaces, cultural centers, and clubs in various enterprises and institutions, 500 more than originally planned, for which more than 72 million rubles were spent.
    The Soviet Union published the first volume of the Encyclopedia of Agriculture last year. This is the completely revised third edition of the encyclopedia, which includes important decisions made by the Soviet government regarding agriculture after the war, as well as the major achievements of Soviet Michurin agricultural biology. The encyclopedia is divided into four volumes and contains more than 2,000 articles on various aspects of agriculture. The first volume contains 500 articles, including Lysenko's paper on genetics.
    Librarians at the All-Union State Library of Foreign Literature are currently cataloging foreign translations of famous works by Soviet writers. The works of more than 350 Soviet prose writers, poets, and playwrights have been translated into 32 languages.
    In November 1949, the Central Theater of the Soviet Red Army premiered "The Voice of America," a new play by Stalin Prize winner Lavrenyov. The play exposes the conspiracies of Wall Street reactionaries against democracy and peace and depicts the awakening of the American people and how they are fighting to defend democracy and peace.
    The Soviet Union has established more than 250 museums in the past three years. There are now more than 1,000 museums in the Soviet Union, and the area occupied by museums has increased more than fourfold compared to the pre-revolutionary period. The Soviet Union is currently establishing hundreds of local history museums and memorial museums.
