    Fengtai Section of Tianjin Railway Bureau
    Locomotive No. 1939
    Breaks Through Two “Class A Inspections,” Safely Travels Over 90,000 Kilometers.
    [Our Dispatch] Locomotive No. 1939, operated by Li Yonglu, the driver of the Fengtai Section of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, safely traveled 97,400 kilometers from March of last year to January of this year, surpassing two "Class A inspections" (the "Class A inspection" period for this railway is stipulated as 35,000 kilometers), saving a total of more than 321,400 jin of millet. It created excellent results second only to the "Iron Ox" locomotive. The Fengtai Section began implementing the "contract system" in March of last year, and Li Yonglu, Zhang Jingzhi, Bai Yunrui, and other nine people were the first to contract the first locomotive – No. 1939. Under the leadership and influence of this group, 35 locomotives in the Fengtai Locomotive Depot successively implemented the "contract system." Because Li Yonglu was able to unite all members of the group, humbly learn, and work with a serious and responsible attitude, the locomotive achieved brilliant results.
    At the beginning of the contract operation, Zhou Ximing and Ma Yuhe in Li Yonglu's contract group were always unenthusiastic and often quarreled with him. However, Li Yonglu treated people sincerely, explained patiently, took the lead in doing work himself, and did the most difficult tasks; when holding criticism meetings, he first humbly criticized himself. Under his influence and help, Zhou Ximing and Ma Yuhe gradually improved. When the locomotive safely traveled 7,000 kilometers, and the Railway Bureau rewarded them with 20,000 yuan, it greatly encouraged their morale, and the entire group acted in unity, helping each other. This is the first major reason why Locomotive No. 1939 achieved success.
    In the early stages of implementing the responsibility system for train crews, they were somewhat at a loss. Coincidentally, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive came to Fengtai, and Li Yonglu immediately went to the old hero Li Yong (the driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive) to learn from him. Comrade Li Yong introduced the methods of contracting repairs, inspections, and operation to him one by one, and they quickly learned Class C and Class B inspections and began to master new working methods and technologies.
    "Thorough inspection and normal oiling" is Li Yonglu's important experience in protecting the locomotive and extending the Class A inspection period. According to normal practice: the "air chamber" should be oiled at a rate of three drops per minute, the "air pump" one drop per minute, and the air pipe at two points; at the same time, it is also necessary to always pay attention to the "piston rod" oiling level. If the rod appears white and bright, it indicates a lack of oil and should be "oiled" immediately. Because Locomotive No. 1939 was "oiled" normally, the locomotive parts did not wear easily, allowing the "backing iron," which in the past could only be used for a maximum of 10,000 kilometers, to be used for 80,000 kilometers before it was damaged.
    In the journey of over 90,000 kilometers, the average number of cars pulled by Locomotive No. 1939 per month was 252, an increase of one-third compared to the past. In the statistics for December of last year alone, 36.85 kilograms of cylinder oil and 27.02 kilograms of axle oil were saved. Before the contract operation, it took 7 tons of coal for a 120-ton train to run from Fengtai to Tianjin. Now it has been reduced to 4.5 tons.

    天津铁路局丰台段
    一九三九号机车
    突破两个“甲检”，安全行车九万余公里。
    【本报讯】天津铁路局丰台段司机长李永禄包乘的冖ㄎ①一九三九号机车，从去年三月到今年一月的十一个月中，安全行车九万七千四百公里，突破两个“甲检”（该路“甲检”期规定为三万五千公里），共节省小米三十二万一千四百多斤。创造了仅次于“铁牛号”的优越成绩。丰台段于去年三月开始实行“包乘制”，李永禄和张静之、白运瑞等九人便首先包乘了第一台机车——一九三九号。在这个组的带领和影响下，丰台机厂三十五台机车都先后实行了“包乘制”。由于李永禄能团结全体组员，虚心学习，工作态度认真负责，使该机车获得光辉成绩。
    在开始包乘时，李永禄包乘组内周希明、马玉鹤二人老是干的不起劲，常和他闹蹩扭。但李永禄待人诚恳，耐心解说，工作时自己领头干，捡最困难的做；开检讨会时，他先虚心地检讨自己。在他的影响和帮助下，周希明、马玉鹤就渐渐进步了。当该机车安全行车七千公里，路局奖励他们二万元时，更大大地鼓舞了他们的情绪，全组行动团结一致，互相帮助，这是一九三九号机车获得成绩的第一个主要原因。
    在实行乘务负责制的初期，他们还有些摸不着底。可巧“毛泽东号”机车来到丰台，李永禄立即去找老英雄李永（毛泽东号的司机长）学习，李永同志便把包修、包检、包乘等办法一一介绍给他，他们较快地学会了丙检和乙检，开始掌握了新的工作方法与技术。
    “彻底检查、正常给油”是李永禄保护机车，延长甲检的重要经验。按正常道理：“气室”给油一分钟为三滴，“风泵”一分钟一滴，气管为两点；同时还须经常留心注意“鞲鞲杆”挂油程度，杆如发白亮色、即系缺油现象，应马上“给油”。由于冖ㄎ①一九三九号“给油”正常、机车零件摩损不易，使过去顶多仅能使用一万公里的“扒根”，用到八万公里时才损坏。
    在九万余公里的行程里，冖ㄎ①一九三九机车的牵引辆数平均每月为二五二辆，比过去增加了三分之一。仅去年十二月一个月统计，即节省气筒油三六·八五公斤、车轴油二七·○二公斤，包乘以前，丰台到天津，载重一二○吨列车每跑一趟，需煤七吨，现在减少到四吨半。
