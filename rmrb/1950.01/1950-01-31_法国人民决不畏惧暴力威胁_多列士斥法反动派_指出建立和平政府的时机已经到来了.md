Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 30th: TASS, Paris, January 28th: French Communist Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez, speaking at a rally in Plessis-Robinson, near Paris, stated: Against the backdrop of the despicable war in Vietnam, responsible military figures and members of parliament are engaging in vile factionalism and conspiracies. They collude with collaborators, engage in conspiracies, and conduct dubious transactions. The government and the National Assembly (with the exception of Communist Party members and a few other members) are attempting to conceal the truth.

Thorez continued by saying that the government, obeying de Gaulle’s instructions, threatens the working people who are fighting for peace, bread, and freedom. However, the shameless acts of these worthless rulers cannot intimidate the honest people and will not cause the mothers of France and all French republicans who oppose the war to retreat. No diversionary tactics, no lies, slanders, or police violence can hide from the people the shameful defeat suffered by the rulers and the policies of poverty, reaction, and war they pursue.

Thorez finally declared: The time has come to re-implement a French policy that guarantees the independence of our nation. The time has come to restore a policy of peace, progress, and freedom – only this policy can lead to the establishment of a democratic and united government that enjoys the faith of the working class and all the people. The time has come for all working people and all republicans to unite and take common action to establish a peaceful government that honestly fulfills its responsibilities to the people.

    法国人民决不畏惧暴力威胁
    多列士斥法反动派
    指出建立和平政府的时机已经到来了
    【新华社北京三十日电】塔斯社巴黎二十八日讯：法国共产党总书记多列士在巴黎近郊普列塞——罗班松的集会上发表演说称：在卑鄙的越南战争的背景前面，负责的军方人士与国会议员正在从事丑恶的植党营私和阴谋诡计。他们和通敌分子勾结，玩弄阴谋，从事暧昧的交易。而政府与国民议会（除了共产党议员与少数其它议员以外）则企图隐瞒真相。
    多列士继称，政府服从了戴高乐的训令，威胁为和平、面包与自由而斗争的劳动人民。但是，这些无价值的统治者们的无耻勾当，吓不倒诚实的人民，并且不会使反对战争的法国的母亲们和一切法国的共和分子退却。任何转移视线的行动，任何谎言、诽谤和任何警察的暴力行动，都不能在人民面前掩蔽统治者及他们所奉行的贫穷、反动与战争的政策所遭到的可耻惨败。
    多列士最后宣称：重新执行保障我们国家独立的法国政策的时机已经到来了。恢复和平、进步与自由的政策——只有这个政策能够导致成立一个享有工人阶级与全体人民的信仰的、民主的、团结的政府——的时机已经到来了。全体劳动人民与全体共和分子团结起来，采取共同行动以建立一个廉洁地执行对人民的责任的和平政府的时机已经到来了。
