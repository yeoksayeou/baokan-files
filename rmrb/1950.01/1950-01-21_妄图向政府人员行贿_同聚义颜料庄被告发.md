    Attempt to Bribe Government Personnel
    Tongjuyi Paint Store Accused
    [Beijing News] The manager of Tongjuyi Paint Store in this city, in collusion with Ren Zishen, chairman of the Paint Industry Association, attempted to bribe government personnel. The Tax Bureau has ordered the two to publish an apology to the government in the newspaper. Tongjuyi Paint Store concealed a large amount of unreported goods. After being discovered by the Tax Bureau on December 21st of last year, the Tax Bureau, in consideration of its business operations, only imposed a fine of one time the amount after education and supplementary tax payment. Unexpectedly, the store's manager, Cheng Shuzhi, did not understand the government's policy of protecting private industry and commerce. He mistakenly believed that the reason for the light penalty was due to the favor of Deng Bowu, an investigator from the Tax Bureau. On the evening of January 13th at 8 p.m., he colluded with Ren Zishen, chairman of the Paint Industry Association, and feigned a casual visit to Deng's home. Upon leaving, they took out 120,000 yuan, claiming it was for the children. Although Deng refused to accept it, Ren and Cheng pushed and pulled, stubbornly leaving the money behind. The next morning, Deng Bowu reported the matter to the Tax Bureau. After investigation, the Tax Bureau convened a general meeting of all members of the Paint Industry Association yesterday (20th) afternoon and reported the details of the incident. Ren and Cheng were ordered to confess their mistakes in public, retrieve the bribe money, and publish an apology to the People's Government, repenting their errors. This incident serves as a good lesson for individual merchants who still harbor intentions of bribery in their thinking.

    妄图向政府人员行贿
    同聚义颜料庄被告发
    【北京讯】本市同聚义颜料庄经理会同颜料业公会理事长任子慎向政府工作人员行贿，税局已责成二人登报向政府道歉。同聚义颜料庄隐匿未报货物甚多，于去年十二月二十一日被税局查出后，税局为照顾其营业，于教育补税后，仅处以一倍之罚金。不料该号经理成树芝不了解政府保护私人工商业政策，以为所以罚得轻是税局稽查员邓伯武说的人情，乃于一月十三日晚八时伙同颜料业公会理事长任子慎假意到邓家中闲谈，临行时取出十二万元，说是给小孩子的，邓虽拒绝不受，但经任成两人推推拉拉硬把钱留下了。第二日晨，邓伯武便将此事向税局告发。税局研究后，乃于昨（二十）日下午召集颜料业全体会员大会，报告了这件事的经过。责成任、成二人当众坦白其错误，领回贿金，并登报向人民政府道歉悔过。这事对个别在思想上还存在有行贿意图的商人是一个很好的教训。
