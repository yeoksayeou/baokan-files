    Turning Scrap Iron into Steel
    — A Visit to North China’s First Prison
    By Li Zhu and Yang Xuejun, China University of Political Science and Law

    North China's First Prison, under the Kuomintang, was a place filled with gloom and terror. However, wealthy prisoners could enjoy lavish meals and celebrate birthdays within the prison walls, while those without money not only suffered from the wardens' embezzlement of their meager rations but also had to kowtow to the guards and serve the wealthy inmates. Now, the prison policy of the People's Government is not like this. As long as you are a prisoner, you receive the same treatment in terms of supplies and participate equally in labor and study. If you have money, you are not free to send food at will. There is no terror here, but rather the awakening of prisoners' self-awareness. Prisoners are transformed through labor. Prisoners are called "New People," and all facilities are designed to implement the goal of "education and transformation." The transformation of prisoners is carried out according to principles. The transformation of reactionaries and their loyal accomplices is carried out in a compulsory manner, eliminating their reactionary ideas and turning them into new working people. The crimes of ordinary people can be said to be more influenced by the remnants of the old society. For them, an educational approach is adopted to make them realize their mistakes and become good working people again. North China's First Prison is correctly implementing the prison policy of the People's Government.

    Sitting in the reception room of the prison, we felt the atmosphere of a school, not a prison. To the north, we heard an orchestra blending with Beijing opera, with rhythm and cadence; to the northwest, there was a clamor of gongs and drums, sounding like the beat of a Yangge dance; to the west, there was a burst of chorus singing, very rhythmic. These are the cultural and recreational activities organized by the prisoners' own cultural and recreational committee in preparation for the New Year's Eve performance.

    North China’s First Prison holds 2,117 prisoners, divided into five cell blocks, each block being like five alleys. Prisoners of the same nature live in the same cell block. Different types of prisoners are housed separately, and there are also infirmary cells and female cells. The cells have ample sunlight and air and are not damp. There are single cells, double cells, and shared cells (several people living in one room). The beds are wooden planks, and the bedding is neatly arranged. Except for a few individuals under close surveillance who need to have their doors locked at night, the doors are generally left open day and night. There is a library managed by the prisoners themselves, as well as a ball field, a laundry, and the prisoners' own wall newspaper, on which they write about their mistakes and reflections. There is also a New People's Covenant formulated by the prisoners through democratic discussion, as well as production challenges and production records. Prisoners have eight hours of productive labor each day, with ample rest and study time. Everything is a regular, organized life.

    There are three aspects of prison management and prisoner education in North China's First Prison that are worth discussing:

    First, the prisoners manage themselves, which plays a significant role in prison management. North China's First Prison has a "New People's Self-Government Committee," under which there are a Labor Production Committee, a Living Committee, a Study Committee, and a Cultural Entertainment Committee. Leaders are elected from among the prisoners and approved by the prison administration. This organization discusses matters related to the prisoners. For example, how to complete a production task, and how to arrange a work session for the best results. The collected opinions are combined with the prison authorities' guidelines for transforming prisoners at each stage and then implemented. The Prisoner Self-Government Committee has the right to manage their own lives and the right to make legitimate criticisms and suggestions to the guards and the prison. The Self-Government Committee regularly reviews its work and makes summaries. The existence of the New People's Self-Government Committee does not mean that the prison leadership does not manage, but rather that the prisoners manage themselves under the premise of good management. The result of using this method in North China's First Prison is that it quickly clears up the concerns of ordinary prisoners and eliminates the adversarial concept between prisoners and the prison.

    Second, prisoners are transformed through labor. North China's First Prison has achieved significant results in this regard. There are textile factories, dyeing factories, printing factories, and woodworking factories. These factories not only raise prisoners' awareness of labor but also solve some economic problems. The Labor Production Committee under the Self-Government Committee is the organization that proposes production plans and ensures their completion. The Labor Production Committee itself records the prisoners' production enthusiasm and labor achievements, and makes commendations or criticisms based on these records. This record is a reliable measure for the prison to reward and punish. Therefore, it is correct to judge the degree of prisoners' ideological transformation from their performance in labor production. In addition to participating in labor in various factories, prisoners also participate in other labor, such as participating in the construction of Tiananmen Square, etc.

    Third, ideological education is combined with labor, and the central link of ideological education is criticism and self-criticism. In the early days of taking over, prisoners did not understand criticism and self-criticism, which hindered the progress of criticism and self-criticism. After organizing labor production, North China's First Prison used three ways to reward labor production—bonuses, meritorious service, and parole—to break through the obstacles to criticism and self-criticism and quickly eliminate the phenomenon of shielding. Bonuses are awarded to those who have achieved results in labor, but the awarding of bonuses must be determined by everyone and authenticated by the prison administration. In the discussion of the evaluation, the atmosphere of harmony is broken. Prisoners very realistically point out when someone has violated labor discipline, when someone has wasted raw materials, or when someone has said irresponsible things. One bonus movement improves the prisoners' thinking by one step.

    Meritorious service is for outstanding achievements in labor production or for valuable creations. Obtaining parole after three meritorious services plays a tremendous role in prisoner education. Anyone who obtains parole must also be evaluated by everyone and made a written assessment, and then approved by the hospital affairs meeting and submitted to the original sentencing authority for parole. For those who are determined to be paroled, the group holds a farewell party, and the entire prison holds a farewell parole conference. The paroled person wears a red flower and goes on stage to report to all the people in the prison, swearing in front of everyone: to be a working person after release from prison. At this time, the prison administration explains the prison policy to the prisoners and encourages those in prison to follow the example of those who are paroled. At this time, the Cultural Entertainment Committee puts on a play with political education, depicting the transformation of prisoners' thinking. In these ways, North China's First Prison improves the prisoners' thinking and turns bad people into good people.

    Only prisons under the leadership of the People's Government wholeheartedly do things for the people. This is a prison, but also a melting pot, turning pieces of scrap iron into steel.

    把废铁炼成钢
    ——华北第一监狱参观报告
    中国政法大学李卓、杨学钧
    华北第一监狱在国民党时代是充满阴森和恐怖的。但是有钱的犯人可以在监内大鱼大肉，可以在监内做寿，而没钱的犯人不仅忍受监狱里对他囚粮的中间克扣，而且低三下四接受看守的命令，伺候有钱的犯人。如今，人民政权的监狱政策不是这样的，只要你是犯人，一样的供给待遇，一样地参加劳动，参加学习，你有钱，但没有随意送食品的自由。这里没有恐怖，有的是启发犯人的自觉，通过劳动来改造犯人，称犯人为“自新人”，一切的设施为了贯彻“教育改造”的目的。改造犯人是有原则的进行的，对反动分子及其忠实帮凶的改造是采取强制的方式，消灭他们的反动思想，使之变成新的劳动人民。一般群众的犯罪，可以说受旧社会残余影响的成分较多，对于他们，采用教育方式，使他们认识错误，重新做一个好的劳动人民。华北第一监狱是正确执行人民政府监狱政策的。
    我们坐在监狱的会客室里，感觉到的是学校的气息，不是监狱的气息。北面是管弦乐里夹着京戏，有韵有节；西北面是锣鼓喧天，听来是秧歌鼓点；西面是一阵阵的大合唱，很有节奏。这是犯人自己组织的文娱委员会领导下的文娱活动，准备元旦晚会上的演出。
    华北第一监狱有犯人二一一七名，分五个监筒，每一个筒等于五条胡同，同一性质的犯人住在同一个监筒里。各种犯人分开来住，还有病监和女监。监房有充足的阳光和空气，并不阴湿，有单人监房、双人监房、和杂监房（几个人住一个房间），床铺是木板床，被褥整齐，除了个别重点监视在深夜需要锁门外，一般白天黑夜都把门打开。有由犯人自己管理的图书馆，有球场，有洗衣处，有犯人自己的壁报，壁报上写出自己的错误和反省，有犯人经过民主讨论而制订的自新人公约，有生产挑战书和生产纪录。犯人每天有八小时的生产劳动，充足的休息和学习时间，一切都是过着规律的组织生活。
    华北第一监狱在监狱管理和犯人教育上有三点是值得提出来谈谈的：
    第一是犯人自己管理自己，在监狱管理上说，有很大的作用。华北第一监狱有“自新人自治委员会”，下设劳动生产委员会、生活委员会，学习委员会、文化娱乐委员会，由犯人中选出负责人，由监狱管理机关批准。这种组织讨论有关犯人的事情。譬如说：怎样去完成一个生产任务，怎样布置会收得好的效果。把讨论的意见集中起来，加上监狱机关改造犯人在每一个阶段的方针，然后贯彻下去。犯人自治委员会有管理他们自己生活之权，有对看守人员及监狱提出正当批评与建议之权。自治会定期检讨工作，做出总结。有自新人自治委员会的组织，不等于监狱领导方面不去管理，而是在搞好管理的前提下由犯人自己管理自己。华北第一监狱运用这种方法的结果，很快地扫清一般犯人的顾虑，消除了犯人与监狱的对立观念。
    第二是通过劳动来改造犯人，华北第一监狱在这方面有显著的成绩。这里有纺织工场、漂染工场、印刷工场、木工场，这些工场一方面提高了犯人的劳动观念，一方面解决了部分经济问题。自治委员会下的劳动生产委员会就是由犯人提出生产计划并保证完成的组织，劳动生产委员会自己记录犯人的生产情绪和劳动成绩，按照这种纪录提出表扬或批评。这种纪录是监狱进行奖惩可靠的尺度。所以说从犯人劳动生产的表现上来看犯人思想改造的程度是正确的。犯人除了参加各场的劳动，还参加其他的劳动，如参加修建天安门广场的劳动等等。
    第三是思想教育与劳动结合，思想教育的中心环节是批评与自我批评。在接管初期，犯人并不认识批评与自我批评，使批评与自我批评的进行受到阻碍。华北第一监狱在组织劳动生产以后，用奖金、立功、假释三个奖励劳动生产的方式，突破了批评与自我批评的阻碍，很快地杜绝了包庇现象。奖金是奖励在劳动中有成绩的，但给奖金要经过大家评定，由监狱管理机关鉴定的。在评定的讨论中打破一团和气，犯人很实在地指示某人什么时候破坏过劳动纪律，某人什么时候浪费了原料，或者某人在什么时候说了不负责任的话。一次奖金运动，把犯人思想提高一步。
    立功是在劳动生产中有优异的成绩，或者有了有价值的创造，立功三次取得假释的资格，这在犯人教育上起了绝大的作用。凡取得假释的人也得经过大家评定，做成鉴定，再通过院务会议，呈请原判机关假释。凡确定假释的人，小组开送别会，全监狱开欢送假释大会。假释的人佩带红花，上台向全监狱的人作报告，当着全体人前面宣誓：出狱后做个劳动人民。监狱管理机关在这时向犯人讲解监狱政策，鼓励在狱的人向假释的人看齐。文娱委员会在这时上演富有政治教育的剧，刻划犯人思想的转变。在这些方式上华北第一监狱提高了犯人思想，把坏人变成好人。
    只有人民政权领导下的监狱在全心全意为人民做事，这是监狱，也是熔炉，把一块一块的废铁炼成钢。
