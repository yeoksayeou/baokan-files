Shanghai Timely Adjustment of Goods Tax Rates to Ensure National Fiscal Revenue
[Special dispatch from this newspaper] This reporter, Lù Hào, reports: The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Goods Tax, in a timely manner according to price changes, rationally adjusted tax rates. During price fluctuations, it played a considerable role in tightening currency, stabilizing prices, and ensuring national fiscal revenue. It also demonstrated the consistency of ensuring national fiscal revenue and protecting the policy of industry and commerce. The Shanghai Tax Bureau originally stipulated that tax rates should be adjusted every half month, and new adjustments would be made when prices rose or fell by 20%. However, if rigidly adhering to the regulations and not adjusting in a timely manner, there would be a great loss in tax revenue, and it would not benefit prices. The Shanghai Tax Bureau appropriately solved this problem, and as a result, the tax revenue collected from November 1st to 10th exceeded the planned tax price by 5.3 billion. On the 15th and 16th, when price fluctuations were most intense, the extra revenue collected in one day was 630 million yuan. After adjusting the tax rate on cigarettes alone, the income increased by 270 million yuan. Therefore, in terms of fiscal revenue, a loss of 15 billion yuan was avoided in November. At that time, some people thought that this approach would hit the development of industry and commerce, or that it would stimulate price increases. But the facts have proved that the more revenue the state has, the more financial strength it can increase, and the more it can reduce the fiscal burden caused by price fluctuations. Especially during price fluctuations, if tax rates are not adjusted reasonably and in a timely manner, it will be equivalent to using the state's fiscal revenue to help speculative merchants stir up trouble. Because the basic reason for price fluctuations is excessive currency, adjusting tax revenue is an appropriate measure to tighten currency, withdraw currency, and stabilize prices. It can be seen that price increases are by no means caused by the timely adjustment of tax revenue, but precisely because the timely adjustment of tax revenue greatly helps to stabilize prices.

Beijing's Failure to Adjust Goods Tax Rates in a Timely Manner Results in Losses to National Fiscal Revenue
There are still significant loopholes in Beijing's goods tax collection work in terms of adjusting tax rates. Taking the vehicle license plate donation from October 20th to November 21st as an example: when collecting this donation tax, the announced price of millet was 210 yuan per catty, but by November 20th, millet was already 750 yuan per catty. Although it was discovered in the middle, the mechanical execution of the decision not to adjust the millet price within a month resulted in a great loss to the fiscal revenue at that time. In total, 293,689 vehicles of various types completed the donation within one month, and the tax revenue received was 2,245,824 catties of millet. If calculated at a minimum average loss of 350 yuan per catty of millet, the national fiscal revenue loss reached 790 million yuan. In the past, Beijing's tax rate adjustments were determined on the 28th of each month by the North China Taxation Administration, which was responsible for convening personnel from the tax bureaus of Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan to jointly discuss the work. Adjustments were made once a month, and it was stipulated that localities could only handle the situation themselves based on specific circumstances when price increases or decreases differed from the original stipulated price by 25%. This created a loophole. For example, in November, the cigarette tax rate was adjusted twice, and the adjusted tax rate was 140% higher than the original tax rate, but the price of Mei Fei cigarettes rose by 180% in one month. Because the Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau failed to adjust the tax rate in a timely manner due to price fluctuations in November, the daily regular tax revenue was reduced by two-thirds during the most severe period.

The experience of Shanghai is not only applicable to times of price fluctuations, but also to situations where prices are relatively stable. Taking Beijing Fuxing Flour Mill as an example: From December 1st to 20th, the tax-paid price of flour was not adjusted, but the following changes can be seen by comparing the sales price (i.e., the actual selling price) with the tax-paid price: the tax-paid price set for Grade 1 flour in December was 48,780 yuan, while the average sales price in early December was 51,000 yuan, and in mid-December it was 55,000 yuan. Compared with the tax amount set by the tax-paid price and the sales price, the tax bureau collected 55 yuan less per bag of flour in early December and 155 yuan less per bag in mid-December. The factory produced a total of 23,129 bags of machine-made flour in 20 days. According to the survey, the income from this goods tax was reduced by more than 2.1 million yuan. The Beijing Taxation Bureau's failure to reasonably adjust tax rates has resulted in huge losses to national fiscal revenue. At a time when the state urgently needs to increase revenue to make up for deficits, stabilize prices, and overcome financial difficulties, this lesson is worthy of attention and remembrance by relevant departments and tax workers.

    上海及时调整货物税额作到保证国家财政收入
    【本报特讯】本报记者陆灏报导：上海市货物税局，及时根据物价变动，合理调整税额，在物价波动时，对紧缩通货，平稳物价，保证国家财政收入，起了相当大的作用，并表现了保证国家财政收入和保护工商业政策的一致性。上海税局本来规定每半月调整一次税额，当物价上涨或下降百分之二十时，再作新的调整。但如墨守规定，不及时调整，对于税收必受很大损失，对物价亦无好处。上海税局恰当地解决了这个问题，结果能使十一月一日到十日，比预定完税价格所收之税款增加了五十三亿。在物价波动最激烈的十五日到十六日一天内，就多收了六亿三千万元，仅纸烟一项调整税额后，就增加了二亿七千万元的收入。因而在十一月份一个月内，在财政收入上说，得以避免了一百五十亿元的损失。当时有些人以为这种做法会打击工商业的发展，或者说会刺激物价的上涨。但事实证明，国家多一份收入，就可增加财政上一分力量，就可以减少一分因物价波动所给予财政上的发行负担。特别是在物价波动的时候，如不及时合理调整税额，就会等于拿国家的财政收入，去帮助投机商人兴风作浪。因为物价波动的基本原因是通货过多，调整税收正是紧缩通货，回笼货币、稳定物价的适当措施。由此可见，物价上涨决不是因及时调整税收而引起的，恰恰是由于及时调整税收而大有助于平稳物价。
            北京货物税额调整不及时国家财政收入遭受损失
    北京市的货物税征收工作在调整税额方面，目前尚有很大的漏洞。以十月二十日开始至十一月廿一日之车牌照捐为例：此项捐税在征收时，公布纳捐小米每斤为二百一十元，但到十一月二十号小米已经是每斤七百五十元了。中间虽经发觉，但因机械执行米价在一个月内不加调整的决定，就使当时财政收入受到很大损失。总计一个月内完捐之各种车辆为二十九万三千六百八十九辆，收到税款为二百二十四万五千八百二十四斤小米，如最低限度平均按每斤小米损失三百五十元计算，国家财政收入损失即达七亿九千万元。北京市的税额调整，过去是每月二十八日由华北税务总局负责召集京、津、唐三地税局负责该项工作的人员共同讨论确定的。每月调整一次，并规定物价涨落与原规定价相差百分之二十五的时候，各地才可按具体情况自行处理。这里就发生了一个漏洞。例如：十一月份香烟税额调整了两次，调整后之税额比原来税额增加百分之一百四十，但美妃烟的价格一月内上涨了百分之一百八十。北京市税务局在十一月份因物价波动未及时调整税额，就使得最严重时每日的经常税收比平时要减少三分之二。
    上海的经验不但适用物价波动的时候，同样也适用于物价比较稳定的情况。以北京福兴面粉厂为例：十二月一日至二十日内，面粉的完税价没有调整，但将销售价（即实际卖货价格）与完税价相比较，就可以看出下面的变化：一号粉在十二月份所定的完税价是四万八千七百八十元，而十二月份上旬销售价平均是五万一千元，中旬是五万五千元。以完税价所定的税额和销售价所定税额相比，上旬每袋面粉税局少收五十五元，中旬每袋少收一百五十五元。该厂二十天共出机制面粉为二万三千一百二十九袋，据调查此项货物税即减少二百十余万元的收入。北京税务局因没有合理调整税额而使国家财政收入受到巨大损失，在国家极需增加收入以弥补赤字、稳定物价、渡过财政困难的今天，此一教训是值得有关部门和税务工作者注意和记取的。
