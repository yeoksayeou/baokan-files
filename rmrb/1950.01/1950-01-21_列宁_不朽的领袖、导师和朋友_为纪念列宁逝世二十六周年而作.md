    The great pioneer of the Chinese revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, once called Lenin "the immortal Lenin" and "the saint of revolution." This was after Sun Yat-sen, following the October Revolution, saw the trend of the times, abandoned his old Three People's Principles belonging to the old democratic sphere, and created his new Three People's Principles belonging to the new democratic sphere. Lenin has been dead for twenty-six years, but isn't his name becoming more and more radiant and well-known? Hasn't history completely confirmed Stalin's words, "Lenin is not only the leader of the Russian proletariat, not only the leader of the European workers, not only the leader of the colonial East, but also the leader of all the working people on earth"?

    I
    Lenin, born in 1870, was a middle school and university student. His father was a primary school teacher. While studying at the Faculty of Law of Kazan University, he excelled in his studies and became involved with local revolutionary groups. He earnestly studied Marx's Capital and joined a Marxist group. In 1893, he moved to St. Petersburg to propagate Marxism among the workers. He wrote a book criticizing the Populists called "What is to be Done?" which emphasized the leading role of the working class in the revolutionary struggle and proposed the idea of a worker-peasant alliance. Subsequently, he organized the "League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class," which was the embryo of the Russian Marxist party. In December 1895, Lenin was arrested and later exiled to Siberia. There, he wrote his famous work, The Development of Capitalism in Russia.

    In 1900, Lenin returned from exile, went abroad, and founded the Iskra (Spark) newspaper, calling for the unity of revolutionary forces. In 1902, Lenin wrote "What Is to Be Done?", which shattered the then-popular economism that believed the working class should only engage in economic struggles, laying the ideological foundation for the Bolshevik Party. In 1903, the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was held, where differences of opinion arose, and the Menshevik and Bolshevik factions emerged. The former were opportunists, and the latter were revolutionary Marxists. At this time, Lenin wrote "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back," which fully formulated the doctrine of the proletarian party, laying the organizational foundation for the Bolshevik Party.

    In 1905, the Russian Revolution broke out, and Lenin led this revolution from beginning to end. He also wrote "Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution," creating the theory of the transformation of the bourgeois revolution into a socialist revolution, laying the tactical foundation for the Bolshevik Party.

    After the failure of the 1905 Revolution, Lenin resolutely defended the Party and fought against all kinds of opportunism. In 1912, under Lenin's leadership, the Party Conference expelled the Mensheviks, making the Bolsheviks an independent Marxist party. In 1914, Lenin founded Pravda (Truth). In August 1914, World War I broke out, and he called for turning the imperialist war into a civil war, exposing the deception of the Second International. In 1916, he wrote the famous "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," which provided a profound and scientific analysis of imperialism.

    The February Revolution erupted in 1917, and the Tsar was overthrown. Lenin returned from abroad and published his famous "April Theses," clearly defining the struggle plan for the transition from the bourgeois democratic revolution to the socialist revolution, and put forward the slogan "All power to the Soviets." In July, the Provisional Government ordered Lenin's arrest, and he secretly fled to Finland. In September, he assessed that the time for an armed uprising was ripe and secretly returned to St. Petersburg from Finland to directly lead the uprising. On the evening of October 24 (November 6 according to the Gregorian calendar), the great October Revolution began, and Lenin personally led the work of the uprising at the Smolny Palace. On October 25, revolutionary troops occupied railway stations, post offices, telegraph offices, the State Bank, and government offices. On the same day, the Bolshevik Party published "To the Citizens of Russia," announcing that the bourgeois Provisional Government had been overthrown and state power had been transferred to the Soviets. That evening, the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets opened, passing the Decree on Peace and the Decree on Land drafted by Lenin, establishing the Council of People's Commissars, and electing Lenin as its chairman. Thus, the great October Revolution succeeded.

    However, the landlords and capitalists of Russia were unwilling to lie down, and they colluded with foreign imperialists to conspire to restore the old order, launching a civil war. Lenin and his closest comrade-in-arms, Stalin, led the workers and peasants of Russia, created the Red Army, and fought arduously. Finally, in 1920, they crushed the resistance of the landlords and capitalists and repelled the foreign interventionists. During the civil war, in March 1919, under the direct guidance of Lenin, the Communist International (Third International) was organized as the general staff of the worldwide revolutionary movement.

    After the end of the civil war, Lenin led the work of restoring the Soviet economy, formulating the New Economic Policy and the cooperative plan. From 1922 onwards, Lenin suffered from serious illnesses due to an assassination attempt by counter-revolutionaries in 1918 and the burden of his work. At 6:50 p.m. on January 21, 1924, this greatest figure of the twentieth century, the best leader, teacher, and friend of the working people of the world, passed away.

    II
    Stalin said that there are two types of Marxists in the world. The first type is called Menshevism, called opportunism, and they are dogmatists who mechanically memorize formulas. The second type is creative Marxists, "they believe that the focus of the problem is not the superficial recognition of Marxism, but the implementation of Marxism, the realization of Marxism," they are consistent in word and deed, and they keep Marxism always maintaining its lively revolutionary force. "The name of this part of the people is Bolshevism, Communism. The organizer and leader of this part of the people is Lenin."

    Lenin lived in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. Lenin was a creative Marxist. He most faithfully and strictly adhered to the principles of Marxism, advanced the doctrines of Marx and Engels in light of the new conditions of imperialism and proletarian revolution, and applied this doctrine to practice. This is Lenin's great achievement of worldwide historical significance; and this achievement is entirely based on the principles prescribed by Marx and Engels. Therefore, we say that Leninism is the Marxism of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution; therefore, we call our theoretical system Marxism-Leninism, or simply Marxism-Leninism.

    So, in which main aspects did Lenin develop Marxism? Chairman Mao told us: "There are thousands of truths in Marxism, but in the final analysis, it is one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.' For thousands of years, it has always been said that oppression is justified, exploitation is justified, and rebellion is unjustified. Since Marxism came out, it has overturned this old case. This is a great achievement. This truth was obtained by the proletariat from the struggle, and Marx made a conclusion. Based on this truth, we resist, we struggle, and we engage in socialism." Where does Lenin's merit lie? It lies in the fact that he addressed situations that Marx and Engels did not encounter during their lifetime and greatly elaborated on this truth in the following issues:

    First, Marx and Engels lived in the era before monopoly capitalism, and they made basic analyses of capitalism. Lenin, based on the basic principles of Marx's Capital, analyzed imperialism in light of the new conditions of capitalist development and gave it a very precise and thorough Marxist analysis as the final stage of capitalism, pointed out its roots of disease and the conditions for its inevitable demise; pointed out that imperialism is the eve of socialist revolution; and that under imperialist conditions, socialism can be victorious in one country.

    Second, Marx and Engels had already spoken of the principle that the proletariat must use the dictatorship of the proletariat to rebel. Lenin, based on new conditions and new experiences, more specifically stipulated that the Soviet is the state form of the dictatorship of the proletariat; and recognized that the dictatorship of the proletariat is a special form of class alliance of all the exploited classes led by the proletariat. He also pointed out that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the highest form of democracy within class society; that is, the newest democracy that Chairman Mao spoke of.

    Third, Marx and Engels foresaw that during the transition period from capitalism to socialism, the proletariat in power must implement various measures in the economic, political, and cultural fields in order to establish a new socialist society to replace the old capitalist society. Lenin, based on new conditions and new experiences, confirmed this idea of Marx and Engels and explained that a country that implements the dictatorship of the proletariat, even if it is surrounded by imperialism, can build a complete socialist society as long as it can crush the intervention of the imperialists and correctly solve the domestic peasant problem and obtain the international assistance of the working class. To this end, Lenin also formulated the New Economic Policy, a plan for developing socialist industry, and concrete methods for gradually transforming the small-peasant economy through cooperatives, so that the peasant masses can embark on the path of socialist construction.

    Fourth, Marx and Engels stipulated the basic ideas on the national question and the colonial question. Lenin, based on this foundation and in light of new conditions and new experiences, established a complete doctrine on the national question and the colonial revolution in the era of imperialism. He linked the national question and the colonial question with the issue of overthrowing imperialism, and he declared that the national question and the colonial question are integral parts of the overall issue of the international proletarian revolution.

    Fifth, Marx and Engels stipulated the idea that the Communist Party is the vanguard of the proletariat; and believed that the proletariat cannot liberate itself without a party, and cannot overthrow capitalism. Lenin, based on the new conditions and new experiences of the proletarian struggle in the era of imperialism, further stipulated that: the Party is the highest form of proletarian organization; the dictatorship of the proletariat must be realized through the Party; the Party is the guiding force of the proletariat; the dictatorship of the proletariat can only be led by the Communist Party; the proletarian party must have iron discipline in order for the dictatorship of the proletariat to effectively suppress the exploiters and transform class society into a socialist society.

    III
    Lenin paid close attention to the issue of the Chinese revolution, believing that this was one of the major international issues of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution.

    Lenin was always concerned about the future of the Chinese people for a full quarter of a century. As early as 1900, he condemned the then "Czarist government's policy in China as a criminal policy." He explained the relationship between the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the spirit of internationalism: "The Chinese people do not resent the European people, because there is no conflict between them, but they resent the European capitalists and the European governments that serve the capitalists." (See "The War in China"). Even during the Xinhai Revolution, Lenin foresaw the great significance of the Chinese revolution, pointing out that "the world significance of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle is that this revolutionary struggle will liberate Asia and destroy the rule of the European bourgeoisie" ("On the Chinese Revolution," 1912). At the same time, he analyzed the situation in China at that time, pointing out that Sun Yat-sen was a revolutionary democrat, and his program at that time represented "the truly great ideas of the truly great people." He made such a wise prediction, saying: "As the number of Shanghais in China increases, the Chinese proletariat will also grow. It will probably organize a certain Chinese Social Democratic Labour Party, which, while criticizing Sun Yat-sen's petty-bourgeois fantasies and reactionary views, will probably carefully extract, protect, and develop the revolutionary democratic core of Sun Yat-sen's political and land programs." ("Chinese Democracy and Populism," 1912) Lenin also issued such a warning at that time: "Whether the peasants, who are not led by the proletariat, can withstand the liberals (who will rush to the right as soon as the opportunity arises) with their democratic stance will be clear in the near future." ("Renewing China," 1912).

    History has completely developed in the direction that Lenin predicted. The liberals really did "rush to the right" very quickly. The peasants, who were not led by the proletariat, immediately showed that they could not resist these liberals, and then suffered the brutal oppression of the Northern Warlords and big landlords. But the Chinese proletariat grew with the development of industry. After the October Revolution, the Chinese people found Marxism-Leninism. The Communist Party of China really did appear in 1921. This party, from the beginning, under the guidance of Leninism and following the example of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, became a Lenin-Stalinist revolutionary party. Having absorbed the lessons of political events at home and abroad, Sun Yat-sen was also determined to welcome the October Revolution, welcome Lenin, welcome the Russian people's help to the Chinese people, and welcome the cooperation between the Communist Party of China and him. Thus, there was the first Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and the vigorous Northern Expedition. Sun Yat-sen died. Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution. The Chinese working class and the Communist Party carefully extracted, protected, and developed the revolutionary democratic core of Sun Yat-sen's program, and strongly led the peasants in the ten years of land revolution and the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. After more than three years of the People's Liberation War, the Chinese people today have achieved revolutionary victory under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, which is armed with Marxism-Leninism and built according to the revolutionary style of Lenin and Stalin.

    This great victory of the Chinese people is inseparable from Lenin's doctrine and cause. In essence, this victory is a continuation of the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, and it is itself a victory of Marxism-Leninism. It was precisely because of Lenin, and after Lenin's death, because of Stalin, that Marxism was developed into a complete doctrine of Marxism-Leninism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, to arm our Chinese revolutionary party, guide the Chinese people's revolution, and achieve complete victory. It was also precisely because of Lenin, and after Lenin's death, because of Stalin, that the Soviet Union was built into a strong fortress for the liberation and peace of all mankind, which could consistently give great help to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation and facilitate the Chinese people's victory. And all of this is precisely because there is a Mao Zedong in China, the best student of Lenin and Stalin, who can create a theoretical system and program for China's transition from a colonial and semi-colonial society to a socialist society—the theory and program of New Democracy—completely based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and in light of the realities of Chinese society and the Chinese revolution, in order to realize the life-giving guidance of Marxism-Leninism for the actual life and struggle of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have acted according to this theoretical system and program and have achieved the current victory; and we will achieve new and greater victories in the future, which is certain.

    Lenin once said in his last essay before his death: "The outcome of the struggle, in the final analysis, depends on the situation in Russia, India, China, and other countries that make up the vast majority of the world's population. It is precisely this majority of the world's population that has been very rapidly involved in the struggle for their own liberation in recent years. Therefore, in this sense, there can be no doubt about the final solution to the problem of the world struggle. Therefore, in this sense, the final victory of socialism is completely and absolutely guaranteed." ("Better Fewer, But Better") History will soon prove the correctness of this scientific prediction by Lenin.

    列宁——不朽的领袖、导师和朋友
    ——为纪念列宁逝世二十六周年而作
    钱俊瑞
    伟大的中国革命的先驱者孙中山先生曾经称呼列宁是“不朽的列宁”，是“革命的圣人”。这是当孙中山先生在十月革命之后，看清了时势，抛弃了他的属于旧民主主义范畴的旧三民主义，创立了他的属于新民主主义范畴的新三民主义的时候的事情。列宁已经死了二十六年了，但是他的名字不是越来越光芒万丈，家喻户晓么？历史不是完全证实了斯大林的话，“列宁不仅是俄国无产阶级的领袖，不仅是欧洲工人的领袖，不仅是殖民地东方的领袖，而且是地球上全体劳动人民的领袖”么？
    一
    列宁从一八七○年出生后，曾当过中学生和大学生。他的父亲是小学教师。他在卡桑大学法学院念书时，功课很好，同时就和当地的革命团体发生联系。他认真地研究马克思的资本论，加入了马克思主义小组。一八九三年，他移居彼得堡，到工人队伍里去宣传马克思主义。他写了一本批评民粹派的书，叫《何谓“人民之友”及他们怎样反对社会民主党人》，着重说明了工人阶级在革命斗争中的领导作用，提出了工农联盟的思想。接着，他组织了“工人阶级解放斗争协会”，这就是俄国马克思主义政党的萌芽。一八九五年十二月，列宁被捕；后来被放逐到西伯利亚。就在那里，他写了他的名著《俄国资本主义的发展》。
    一九○○年，列宁从放逐地回来，出国，办《火星报》，号召团结革命力量。一九○二年列宁写了一本《做什么？》，粉碎了当时曾经流行的认为工人阶级只应当进行经济斗争的经济主义的理论，为布尔什维克党打下了思想的基础。一九○三年，俄国社会民主工党开第二次代表大会，发生了意见的分歧，出现了孟什维克派和布尔什维克派，前者是机会主义者，后者是革命的马克思主义者。这时，列宁写了一本《进一步，退两步》，完整地制定了关于无产阶级政党的学说，为布尔什维克党打下了组织的基础。
    一九○五年，俄国革命爆发，列宁从头到尾领导了这一次的革命。他还写了《社会民主党在民主革命中的两个策略》一书，创立了资产阶级革命转变为社会主义革命的理论，为布尔什维克党打下了策略的基础。
    一九○五年革命失败后，列宁坚决地保卫着党，和各种各色的机会主义斗争。一九一二年，在列宁领导下，党的代表会议赶走了孟什维克，使布尔什维克成为独立的马克思主义政党。一九一四年，列宁创办真理报，一九一四年八月，第一次世界大战爆发，他号召变帝国主义战争为国内战争，揭穿第二国际的欺骗。一九一六年他写了有名的《帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段》一书，对帝国主义作了深刻的科学的分析。
    一九一七年二月革命发作，沙皇被推翻，列宁从国外赶回来，发表他有名的《四月提纲》，明确地规定了从资产阶级民主革命过渡到社会主义革命的斗争计划，提出了“全部政权归苏维埃”的口号。七月，临时政府下令捉列宁，他秘密逃到芬兰。九月，他估计武装起义的时机已经成熟，就从芬兰秘密回到彼得堡，直接领导起义。十月二十四日（公历十一月六日）晚，伟大的十月起义开始了，列宁亲自在斯莫尔尼宫领导起义的工作。十月二十五日革命军队占领了火车站、邮局、电报局、国家银行和政府机关。当天，布尔什维克党公布《告俄国公民书》，宣布资产阶级的临时政府已被推翻，国家政权已归苏维埃。当晚第二次全俄苏维埃代表大会开幕，通过了列宁所起草的和平令和土地令，成立人民委员会，选列宁为主席。这样，伟大的十月革命成功了。
    但是，俄国的地主资本家并不肯从此躺倒，他们勾结了外国帝国主义阴谋复辟，发动了内战。列宁和他最亲密的战友斯大林领导俄国的工人和农民，创立红军，艰苦作战，终于在一九二○年，粉碎了地主和资本家的反抗，击退了外国干涉者。在内战期间，即一九一九年三月，在列宁直接指导下，组织了共产国际（第三国际），作为全世界革命运动的参谋部。
    内战结束后，列宁领导恢复苏联经济的工作，制订新经济政策和合作社计划。一九二二年起，列宁因曾在一九一八年被反革命分子行刺受伤，和繁剧的工作，常害重病。一九二四年一月二十一日晚上六时五十分，这一个二十世纪最伟大的人物，全世界劳动人民的最好的领袖、导师和朋友，就与世长辞了。
    二
    斯大林说过，世界上有两部分马克思主义者。第一部分人的名字叫做孟什维主义，叫做机会主义，他们是死背公式的教条主义者。第二部分人则是创造的马克思主义者，“他们认为问题的重心不是表面承认马克思主义，而是实行马克思主义，实现马克思主义，”他们言行一致，他们使马克思主义始终保持它生动的革命的力量。“这一部分人的名字就是布尔什维主义，共产主义。这一部分的组织者和领袖就是列宁”。
    列宁活着的时代是帝国主义和无产阶级革命的时代。列宁是一个创造的马克思主义者，他最忠实地和最严格地根据马克思主义的原则，针对着帝国主义和无产阶级革命的新条件，向前发展马克思和恩格斯的学说，并把这个学说见之于实际。这就是列宁的伟大的具有全世界历史意义的功绩；而这个功绩是完完全全以马克思和恩格斯所规定的原则为基础的。因此，我们说列宁主义是帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义；因此我们把我们的理论系统称做马克思列宁主义，或单称马列主义。
    那么，列宁究竟在那些主要的方面发展了马克思主义呢？毛主席告诉我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理’。几千年来总是说：压迫有理，剥削有理，造反无理。自从马克思主义出来，就把这个旧案翻过来了。这是一个大功劳。这个道理是无产阶级从斗争中得来的，而马克思作了结论。根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。”列宁的功劳在那里呢？就在于他针对了马克思和恩格斯生前所没有遭遇的情况，在下面几个问题上，大大地发挥了这个道理：
    第一，马克思和恩格斯生在垄断资本主义以前的时代，他们对于资本主义作了基本的分析。列宁根据了马克思《资本论》的基本原理，针对资本主义发展的新条件，分析了帝国主义，并把帝国主义作为资本主义的最后阶段，给它以一个十分精细透辟的马克思主义的分析，指出它的病根，和必然要灭亡的条件；指出帝国主义就是社会主义革命的前夜；在帝国主义条件下，社会主义可能在一个国家内得到胜利。
    第二，马克思和恩格斯已经讲出了无产阶级造反一定要用无产阶级专政的道理。列宁依据新条件新经验，更加具体地规定了苏维埃是无产阶级专政的国家形式；认定无产阶级专政就是以无产阶级为领导的，各被剥削阶级的特殊形式的阶级联盟。他还指出，无产阶级专政是阶级社会内高最形式的民主制；亦就是毛主席所说的最新的民主制。
    第三，马克思和恩格斯预见了在从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期，当权的无产阶级必定要实行经济、政治、文化方面的种种设施，这样来建立社会主义的新社会，代替资本主义的旧社会。列宁依据新条件新经验，证实了马克思和恩格斯的这一思想，并且说明：一个实行无产阶级专政的国家，即使在帝国主义的包围下，只要它能粉碎帝国主义者的干涉，并且能正确地解决国内的农民问题和取得工人阶级的国际援助，它就可能建设起完全的社会主义社会。为此，列宁还拟定了新经济政策，拟定了发展社会主义工业的计划，和经过合作制逐渐地改造小农经济，使农民群众走上社会主义建设的轨道的具体办法。
    第四，马克思和恩格斯规定了关于民族问题与殖民地问题的基本的思想。列宁以此为基础，依据新条件新经验，建立了关于帝国主义时代民族问题和殖民地革命的完整学说，他把民族问题殖民地问题与推翻帝国主义的问题联系起来，他宣布民族问题和殖民地问题是国际无产阶级革命总问题的组成部分。
    第五，马克思和恩格斯规定了共产党是无产阶级先锋队伍的思想；认为无产阶级没有党，就不能解放自己，就不能推翻资本主义。列宁依据帝国主义时代无产阶级斗争的新条件新经验，进一步规定了：党是无产阶级组织的最高形式；无产阶级专政必定要经过党才能实现，党是无产阶级的指导力量；无产阶级专政只能由共产党来领导；无产阶级的政党必须有铁的纪律，才能使无产阶级专政有效地镇压剥削者，把阶级社会改造成为社会主义社会。
    三
    列宁对于中国革命问题曾经给予密切的关心，认为这是帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的重大国际问题之一。
    列宁在足足四分之一的世纪里经常关顾到中国人民的前途。早在一九○○年，他就斥责当时“沙皇政府在中国的政策，乃是一种犯罪的政策”。他用国际主义的精神说明当时中国人民与各国人民的关系：“中国人并不是嫉恶欧洲人民，因为他们彼此之间并没有何种冲突，而是嫉恶欧洲的资本家和给资本家效劳的欧洲各国政府。”（见《中国的战争》）。还在辛亥革命时，列宁就预见了中国革命的伟大意义，他指出“中国人民革命斗争的世界意义，这个革命斗争将使亚洲获得解放，而摧毁欧洲资产阶级的统治”（《关于中国革命》，一九一二）。就在同时候，他分析了当时中国的形势，指出孙中山是革命的民主派，他当时的纲领，代表着“真正伟大的人民之真正伟大的思想。”他作了这样英明的预见，说：“在中国，上海的数目既然将增加，那么中国无产阶级也将增长起来。它大概将组织某个中国社会民主工党，这个政党在批评孙逸仙的小资产阶级空想和反动观点的时候，大概将把孙逸仙的政治纲领和土地纲领中的革命民主主义的核心，关心地抽引出来，保护起来，并发展起来。”（《中国的民主主义与民粹主义》，一九一二）列宁当时并发出这样的警告：“没有被无产阶级领导的农民，是否能够用自己的民主主义的立场，来抵挡住自由派（这派人只待良机到来，就要向右飞奔），这在不远的将来便可看得明白。”（《更新的中国》，一九一二）。
    历史是完全照着列宁所预见的方向发展的。自由派真个是很快“向右飞奔”了。没有无产阶级领导的农民，一下子就表现出抵挡不住这个自由派，随着就遭受着北洋军阀大地主的残酷压迫。但是中国的无产阶级随着工业的发展而增长起来了。经过十月革命，中国人找到了马克思列宁主义。中国共产党果真在一九二一年出现了。这一个政党一开始就在列宁主义的指导下，依照苏联共产党的榜样，成为列宁、斯大林式的革命党。由于吸收了国内外政治事变的教训，孙中山也决心欢迎十月革命，欢迎列宁，欢迎俄国人对中国人的帮助，欢迎中国共产党和他合作。这样就有了第一次的国共合作和轰轰烈烈的北伐战争。孙中山死了。蒋介石叛变了革命。中国的工人阶级和共产党十分关心地抽引、保护和发展孙中山纲领中的革命民主主义的核心，坚强地领导着农民，进行了十年土地革命和八年抗日战争。经过三年多来的人民解放战争，中国人民今天才在一个以马克思列宁主义武装起来，按照列宁斯大林的革命风格建立起来的中国共产党领导之下，得到了革命的胜利。
    中国人民的这个伟大胜利，与列宁的学说和事业是分不开的。这个胜利按其本质来说，乃是十月社会主义革命胜利的继续，它本身就是马克思列宁主义的胜利。正是有了列宁，而在列宁死后，又有了斯大林，马克思主义才被发展成为帝国主义与无产阶级革命时代的马克思列宁主义的完整学说，来武装我们中国的革命党，指导我们中国人民的革命，以致达到完全的胜利。也正是有了列宁，而在列宁死后，又有了斯大林，苏联才被建设成为全人类解放与和平的坚强堡垒，才能一贯地给中国人民解放事业以巨大的帮助，便于中国人民取得胜利。而这一切，也正是在中国有了一个毛泽东，有了这个列宁和斯大林的最好的学生，才能针对着中国社会与中国革命的实际，完完全全依据马克思列宁主义的原则，创立起在中国从殖民地半殖民地社会过渡到社会主义社会的理论体系和纲领——新民主主义的理论与纲领，以实现马克思列宁主义对于中国人民实际生活与斗争的富有生命力量的指导。中国人民根据了这个理论体系和纲领办事，就取得了现在的胜利；而在将来我们还会取得新的更大的胜利，那也是一定的。
    列宁在他逝世前的最后一篇论文里曾经说过：“斗争的结局，归根结底，是取决于俄国、印度、中国等构成世界人口绝大多数的这种情形。正是这世界人口的大多数，最近几年来非常迅速地卷入谋自身解放的斗争。所以在这个意义上讲，关于世界斗争问题的最终解决，不能有丝毫的怀疑。所以，在这个意义上讲，社会主义的最后胜利，是完全和绝对有保证的。”（《宁可少些，但要好些》）历史不要很久就将证明列宁的这一科学预见的正确。
