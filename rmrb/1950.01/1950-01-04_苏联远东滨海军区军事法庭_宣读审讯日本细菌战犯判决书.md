Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 3rd: TASS Moscow, January 1st: On the afternoon of December 30th, the Primorsky Military District Court announced the verdict in the case of the Soviet Socialist Republics' trial of former Japanese army personnel for preparing and using bacteriological weapons.

The trial was held from December 25th to December 30th, 1949. The Primorsky Military District Court was presided over by Major General of Justice Chertkov, with other judges being: Colonel of Justice Irinitsky, Lieutenant Colonel of Justice Vorobyov, and Senior Secretary Colonel Golkin. State Prosecutor – 3rd Class State Legal Advisor Smirnov also participated in the trial. The defendants were defended by: Borovik, Belov, Sannikov, Zverev, Pogachev, Prokopenko, Lukyanov, and Pokovitinov.

The list of Japanese war criminal defendants:

The defendants in the case of the open trial of Japanese war criminals by the Primorsky Military District Court in Khabarovsk were: (1) Yamada Otozo: General, former Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army; (2) Kajitsuka Ryuji: Lieutenant General Medical Officer, Doctor of Medicine, former Chief of the Medical Department of the Japanese Kwantung Army; (3) Kawashima Kiyoshi: Major General Medical Officer, Doctor of Medicine, former Chief of the Production Department of Unit 731 of the Japanese Kwantung Army; (4) Nishi Toshihiko: Lieutenant Colonel Medical Officer, doctor and bacteriologist, former Chief of the Training Department of Unit 731 of the Japanese Kwantung Army; (5) Karasawa Tomio: Major Medical Officer, doctor and bacteriologist, former Section Chief of the Manufacturing Department of Unit 731 of the Japanese Kwantung Army; (6) Onoue Masao: Major Medical Officer, doctor and bacteriologist, former Commander of Detachment 643 of Unit 731 of the Japanese Kwantung Army; (7) Sato Shunji: Major General Medical Officer, doctor and bacteriologist, former Chief of the Medical Department of the Japanese Kwantung Army's 5th Army; (8) Takahashi Takaatsu: Lieutenant General Veterinary Officer, chemist and biologist, former Chief of the Veterinary Department of the Japanese Kwantung Army; (9) Hirazakura Zensaku: Lieutenant Veterinary Officer, veterinary surgeon, former scientific worker of Unit 100 of the Japanese Kwantung Army; (10) Mitomo Katsuo: former Sergeant First Class of Unit 100 of the Japanese Kwantung Army; (11) Kikuchi Norizo: Corporal, former medical orderly and assistant experimenter of Detachment 643 of Unit 731 of the Japanese Kwantung Army; (12) Kurushima Shigeharu: former medical orderly and experimenter of Detachment 162 of Unit 731 of the Japanese Kwantung Army.

All twelve of the above-listed individuals are accused of the crimes listed in Article 1 of the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on April 19, 1943. Preliminary materials of the Military Tribunal and the materials of the court's investigation confirm that the ruling group of imperialist Japan had been preparing for an aggressive war against the Soviet Union for many years. The trial of major Japanese war criminals that concluded in Tokyo in 1948 confirmed that anti-Soviet aggressive war was one of the main factors in the policy of the Japanese ruling group, with the goal of plundering Soviet territory.

The Preparation and Use of Bacteriological Weapons by Japanese Imperialism

Driven by a mad idea of the superiority of the Japanese nation and a mad idea of establishing a "Greater East Asia" under Japanese tutelage, and determined to launch aggressive wars with Hitler's Germany, the Japanese militarists aimed at jointly establishing world hegemony. To achieve this goal, they did not hesitate to commit any heinous crime against humanity.

In their criminal plan for aggressive war against peace-loving nations, the Japanese militarists stipulated the use of bacteriological weapons to spread deadly infectious diseases such as plague, cholera, anthrax, and other terrible diseases, engaging in large-scale slaughter of troops and peaceful residents, including the elderly, women, and children.

For these purposes, several special agencies were established within the Japanese Army to produce bacteriological weapons. Special military units and sabotage groups were also prepared to infect cities, villages, reservoirs, wells, livestock, and grain on the territories of countries that Japan intended to invade with bacteria.

As early as 1931, after Japan occupied Manchuria and turned it into a bridgehead for attacking the Soviet Union, bacteriological laboratories were established under the secret order of the Japanese Kwantung Army, headed by Shiro Ishii, an inhuman theorist and organizer of bacteriological warfare. In 1936, when Japan intensified its military preparations for an anti-Soviet war, the Japanese Army General Staff, under the order of Emperor Hirohito, established two major bacteriological institutions in Manchuria, designated not only to investigate the tools for conducting bacteriological warfare, but also to produce a sufficient quantity of bacteriological weapons to fully supply the Japanese Army.

These organs were highly secret, and for the sake of camouflage, were named "Kwantung Army Water Supply and Disease Prevention Bureau" and "Kwantung Army Animal Infectious Disease Experimental Bureau." They were later renamed "Unit 731" and "Unit 100." These two units had many detachments, attached to the Kwantung Army's detachments and battalions, and stationed at key locations for attacking the Soviet Union in accordance with Japan's anti-Soviet operational plan. These units were in fact combat units, ready to use bacteriological weapons at any time upon receiving orders.

Unit 731 and Unit 100, and their detachments, were under the jurisdiction of the Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army. This has been confirmed by the order issued by the former Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army, Umezu Yoshijiro, on December 2, 1940, regarding the establishment of four detachments of Unit 731. Unit 731 was stationed in a specially constructed and heavily guarded military camp in the Pingfang Station area, 20 kilometers from Harbin. It was a powerful institution for preparing bacteriological warfare, with approximately 3,000 scientific and technical workers, and laboratories equipped with the latest equipment and perfect instruments. The structure of this unit reveals its purpose and actual activities. The unit had several departments. Departments 1, 2, 4, and 5 were responsible for cultivating experimental bacteria and training personnel for bacteriological warfare. Unit 100 was stationed in Mengjiatun, 10 kilometers south of Changchun, engaging in the same crimes as Unit 731.

Preliminary and court investigations have confirmed that two secret units preparing bacteriological weapons were also organized in the Japanese army operating in Central and South China, codenamed "Rong Unit" and "Bo Unit." The activities of these two units were the same as those of Unit 731 and Unit 100.

Because the use of bacteriological weapons also posed the risk of infecting their own troops, the Japanese command organized infectious disease prevention teams in each battalion and regiment, subordinate to the army's medical teams. This was an integral part of the overall plan for preparing bacteriological warfare.

Unit 731 and Unit 100 studied the tools and methods of bacteriological warfare for the purpose of engaging in it, and also conducted inhuman experiments to test the effectiveness of bacteriological weapons using living people. Japanese devils massacred hundreds of thousands of people who fell into their hands in these experiments. The testimony of defendant Kawashima Kiyoshi confirms that in Unit 731 alone, at least 600 prisoners were murdered each year. From 1940 until the Japanese army surrendered in 1945, at least 3,000 people were killed. Unit 100, under the overall supervision of defendant Takahashi Takaatsu, also conducted the same inhuman experiments using living people.

The testing of bacteriological weapons was not limited to experiments conducted in Unit 731 and Unit 100. Japanese imperialists also used bacteriological weapons in the war against China and in sabotage activities against the Soviet Union. In 1940, a special detachment of Unit 731, led by Ishii, was dispatched to the Central China war zone, where they spread fleas infected with plague using specially equipped aircraft, causing a plague epidemic in the Central China war zone.

This criminal activity, which killed thousands of Chinese peaceful residents, was filmed. The film was later shown to representatives of the Japanese Army High Command in Unit 731, and defendant Yamada also watched the film.

Unit 731 also dispatched a similar detachment to Changde in 1941, where plague bacteria were also spread.

In 1942, bacteriological weapons were used again in China. This time, a detachment of Unit 731 (defendants Karasawa and Kawashima both participated in preparing this detachment) acted in concert with the "Rong" Unit, spreading serious infectious bacteria in areas where Japanese troops were forced to withdraw under pressure from the Chinese army. Defendant Sato was the commander of the "Rong" Unit for a period of time.

Unit 100 sent bacteriological groups to the Soviet border several times over the years. Defendants Hirazakura Zensaku and Mitomo were both in this bacteriological group. These bacteriological groups carried out bacteriological sabotage against the Soviet Union, releasing bacteria in reservoirs on the border.

Thus, it has been confirmed in preliminary and court investigations that Japanese imperialists had prepared to widely use bacteriological weapons in launching aggressive wars against the Soviet Union and other countries, thereby plunging mankind into the abyss of new disasters.

Crimes of the Defendants in This Case

The Military Tribunal finds that the following charges against the defendants in this case have been established:

(1) Yamada Otozo, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Kwantung Army from 1944 until the Japanese surrender, directed the criminal activities of Unit 731 and Unit 100 under his command in preparing bacteriological warfare. He encouraged the cruel killing of thousands of people in various experiments using bacteriological weapons in these two units.

Yamada took measures to ensure that Unit 731 and Unit 100 were fully prepared for bacteriological warfare and that their production capacity guaranteed meeting the army's needs for bacteriological weapons.

(2) Kawashima Kiyoshi, Chief of the Production Department of Unit 731 from 1941 to 1943, one of the unit's leading officers, participated in preparing bacteriological warfare, was familiar with the work of all departments of the unit, and personally supervised the incubation of large quantities of deadly bacteria sufficient to fully supply the Japanese army with bacteriological weapons. In 1942, Kawashima participated in organizing the war to use bacteriological weapons in the Central China region. During his entire service in Unit 731, Kawashima personally participated in the mass murder of prisoners held in the unit's prison, infecting prisoners with severe infectious diseases in criminal experiments.

(3) Karasawa Tomio, Section Chief of the Production Department of Unit 731, was one of the active organizers of improving bacteriological weapons and participated in preparing bacteriological warfare. In 1940 and 1942, Karasawa participated in organizing detachments to spread infectious diseases among peaceful residents in China. Karasawa personally participated in experiments using bacteriological weapons on several occasions, as a result of which imprisoned Chinese and Soviet citizens were exterminated.

(4) Kajitsuka Ryuji, who advocated the use of bacteriological weapons since 1931. In 1936, as Director of the Military Hygiene Bureau of the Japanese Army, he assisted in establishing a special bacteriological detachment and staffing it. On his recommendation, Shiro Ishii, who was a Colonel and later promoted to General, was appointed as the commander of the unit. From 1939, Kajitsuka Ryuji served as the Chief of the Hygiene Bureau of the Kwantung Army and personally directed the activities of Unit 731, providing the unit with all the necessities for producing bacteriological weapons.

(5) Nishi Toshihiko, commander of Detachment 673 of Unit 731 stationed in Sunwu from January 1943 until the Japanese surrender, and actively participated in the production of bacteriological weapons. Nishi Toshihiko also served as the Chief of Department 5 of Unit 731, training special cadres for bacteriological warfare in special squads of the Kwantung Army's various units. He personally participated in the murder of imprisoned Chinese and Soviet citizens by infecting them with infectious disease bacteria. In order to cover up the criminal activities of the detachment and Unit 731, when Soviet troops approached the city of Sunwu in 1945, Nishi Toshihiko ordered the burning of the detachment's buildings, equipment, and documents in the city, and carried out this order.

(6) Onoue Masao, commander of Detachment 643 of Unit 731 stationed in Hailin, engaged in research on improving new types of bacteriological warfare weapons and preparing materials needed by Unit 731. He supervised the training of specialized cadres for bacteriological warfare. Onoue was well aware of the mass murders of those imprisoned in Unit 731 and participated in these most serious crimes. On August 13, 1945, in order to eliminate traces, Onoue personally burned all the buildings, stored materials, and documents of the detachment in the city.

(7) Sato Shunji, commander of the bacteriological unit stationed in Guangzhou since 1941, the secret code name of this unit was the "Bo" Unit. In 1943, he was appointed as the commander of the similar "Rong" Unit stationed in Nanjing. When leading these units, Sato participated in improving bacteriological weapons and preparing for bacteriological warfare. Sato later served as the Chief of the Medical Department of the 5th Army of the Kwantung Army, leading Detachment 643 of Unit 731. He knew the criminal nature of the activities of Unit 731 and Detachment 643 and helped them produce bacteriological weapons.

(8) Takahashi Takaatsu, Director of the Veterinary Department of the Kwantung Army, was an organizer of the production of bacteriological weapons and directly led the criminal activities of Unit 100, responsible for inhumane experiments infecting prisoners with serious infectious diseases.

(9) Hirazakura Zensaku, a member of Unit 100, personally conducted research on the production and use of bacteriological weapons. He participated in reconnaissance to the Soviet border several times to discover the most effective methods for attacking the Soviet Union with bacteria. At the same time, he also released bacteria in reservoirs, especially in the Trirechie area.

(10) Mitomo Katsuo, a worker of Unit 100, directly participated in the manufacture of bacteriological weapons and personally conducted bacteriological experiments with living people. Mitomo was a participant in the action of releasing bacteria in the Trirechie area to sabotage the Soviet Union.

(11) Kikuchi Norizo, a medical assistant who carried out practical training, worked in the laboratory of Detachment 643 of Unit 731, and directly participated in the work aimed at discovering new types of bacteriological weapons and cultivating typhoid and dysentery bacteria. In 1945, Kikuchi participated in a special training class for training cadres to engage in bacteriological warfare.

(12) Kurushima Shigeharu, an assistant experimenter of a detachment of Unit 731, participated in the cultivation of cholera, typhoid fever, and other infectious diseases, and specialized training in testing bacteriological bombs.

    上列十二人均犯苏联最高苏维埃主席团一九四三年四月十九日法令第一条所列的罪状。军事法庭的初步材料及法庭的调查材料证实：帝国主义日本的统治集团若干年来就在准备对苏联的侵略战争。一九四八年在东京结束的日本主要战犯的审判证实：反苏侵略战争是日本统治集团政策内的主要因素之一，他们以掠夺苏联的领土为目标。
            日本帝国主义准备和使用细菌武器的经过
    日本军国主义者为日本民族优越感的疯狂观念所驱使，为在日本卵翼下建立“大东亚”的疯狂观念所驱使，并决定与希特勒德国发动侵略战争，其目的，在于共同建立世界霸权，为了达到这个目的，不惜违反人道作出任何滔天罪行。
    日本军国主义者在他们反对爱好和平民族的侵略战争的罪恶计划中，规定使用细菌武器，以散布鼠疫、霍乱、炭疽热和其他可怕疾病的致命的传染病，从事大规模屠杀军队及包括老人、妇女与儿童在内的和平居民。
    为了这些目的，在日本陆军内成立了若干特别机构，用以生产细菌武器，同时又准备了特别军事部队及破坏组，以细菌传染那些日本打算侵略的国家领土上的城市、乡村、贮水池、水井、牲畜和谷物。
    早在一九三一年，日本占领满洲并将满洲变成其进攻苏联的桥头堡垒之后，根据日本关东军的密令建立了细菌实验室，以一名不人道的细菌战争的理论家与组织者石井四郎为首。一九三六年，当日本加紧进行反苏战争的军事准备的时候；日本陆军参谋本部根据裕仁天皇的命令，在满洲成立了两大细菌机构，指定不仅从事调查进行细菌战争的工具，而且还生产足够数量的细菌武器，以充分供应日本陆军。
    这些机关是十分秘密的，为了伪装起见命名为“关东军部队用水供应及疾病预防局”和“关东军兽类传染病试验局”。后来又更名为“七三一部队”和“一○○部队”。这两个部队有许多支队，隶属于关东军的分遣队及大队，并按照日本反苏的作战计划驻扎在进攻苏联的主要地点。这些部队事实上就是战斗部队，任何时候一有命令就可以使用细菌武器。
    七三一部队和一○○部队及其支队均属于关东军总司令管辖。这已为前关东军总司令梅津美治郎在一九四○年十二月二日发布关于成立七三一部队四个支队的命令所证实。七三一部队驻在哈尔滨二十公里附近的平房车站地区特别修建并有严格防守的军营中，这是准备细菌战的有力机构，其中有科学及技术工作者三千人左右，实验室设有最近代化的设备与完善的器械。从它的机构中可以看到这个部队及其实际活动的宗旨。这一部队之下设若干处。其第一、第二、第四、第五处，分别负责培植实验细菌以及训练从事细菌战的各项人员。一○○部队驻在长春以南十公里的孟家屯，从事和七三一部队相同的罪行。
    初步的调查与法庭的调查已证实，在华中与华南作战的日军中也组织了两支准备细菌武器的秘密部队，其暗号为“荣字部队”与“波字部队”。这两支部队的活动，与七三一部队和一○○部队相同。
    由于使用细菌武器也有使他们自己的部队受到传染的危险，日本统帅部便在各个营和各个团中组织了传染病预防队，使之隶属军队中的医务队。这是准备细菌战总计划的组成部分。
    七三一部队与一○○部队为从事细菌战而研究细菌战的工具和方法，同时并以活人作试验细菌武器效能的不人道的实验。日本恶魔在这种实验中残杀了成千上万的落在他们手里的人。被告川岛清的供词证实，仅在七三一部队中，每年就至少要屠杀六百名囚徒，从一九四零年至一九四五年日军投降为止，最少有三千人被害死。一○○部队在被告高桥高笃的总监督下，也用活人作同样不人道的实验。
    细菌武器的试验，并不仅限于七三一部队和一○○部队中所作的实验。日本帝国主义者在对华战争和对苏的破坏活动中也使用了细菌武器。一九四○年，七三一部队特别派遣军由石井率领前往华中战区，用有特别装置的飞机散播染有鼠疫的跳蚤，因此，在华中战区引起了鼠疫传染病。
    这种害死了数以千计的中国和平居民的罪恶的活动摄成了电影，这个电影后来在七三一部队中给日本陆军最高统帅部的代表放映，被告山田也看了这个片子。
    七三一部队在一九四一年还派出了同样的派遣军到常德，那里也传染了鼠疫菌。
    一九四二年，又在中国境内使用了细菌武器。这一次，七三一部队的派遣军（被告唐泽与川岛都参加了准备这支派遣的工作）与“荣”字部队联合行动，在日本军队在中国军队的压力下被迫撤出的地区散布了严重的传染病菌，被告佐藤曾经有一个时期是“荣”字部队的指挥官。
    一○○部队在几年中间曾先后派遣细菌组到苏联边境，被告平樱善作和三友都在这个细菌组内。这些细菌组对苏联推行细菌破坏，在边境上的蓄水池中施放细菌。
    这样，在初步与法庭的调查中业已证实：日本帝国主义者曾经准备在对苏联及其他国家发动侵略战争时广为使用细菌武器，从而将人类投入新灾祸的深渊中。
            本案被告罪状
    军事法庭认为本案各被告以下的罪状业已成立：
    （一）山田乙三，自一九四四年至日本投降时任日本关东军总司令，指导他属下的七三一部队与一○○部队准备细菌战的罪恶活动。在使用细菌武器的各种实验中，鼓励了这两个部队对数以千计的人民的残忍杀害。
    山田曾采取措施使七三一部队与一○○部队有进行细菌战的充分准备，并使其生产能力保证适应军队对细菌武器的需要。
    （二）川岛清，自一九四一年至一九四三年任七三一部队生产处长，为该部队的首要军官之一，参加准备细菌战，熟悉该部队各处工作，并亲自监督足以充分供应日军细菌武器的大量致命细菌孵育的工作。一九四二年，川岛参加组织在华中地区使用细菌武器的战争。川岛在七三一部队的全部服务期间，亲自参加成批谋杀囚禁在该部队监狱中的囚犯，在罪恶的试验中，传染给囚犯以严重传染病的病菌。
    （三）唐泽富雄，七三一部队生产处科长，为从事改进细菌武器工作的积极组织者之一，并曾参加准备细菌战。一九四○年和一九四二年，唐泽参加组织在中国和平居民中散布传染病的派遣军。唐泽曾数度亲自参加使用细菌武器的实验，由于实验的结果，被囚的中国人和苏联公民被灭绝了。
    （四）梶塚龙二，自一九三一年即鼓吹使用细菌武器。一九三六年任日本陆军部军事卫生局局长，他协助建立特别细菌大队并配备其人员，在他的推荐下，曾任大佐以及升任将军的石井四郎，被任命为该部队的长官。由一九三九年起，梶塚龙二即任关东军卫生局长，并亲自指导七三一部队的活动，供给该部队以生产细菌武器的一切必需品。
    （五）西丰彦，自一九四三年一月至日本投降时任驻孙吴的七三一部队六七三支队支队长，并积极参加生产细菌武器。西丰彦同时兼任七三一部队第五处处长，为关东军各部队的特别小队训练进行细菌战的专门干部。他亲身参与以传染传染病细菌的方法谋杀被囚的中国和苏联公民。为掩盖该支队和七三一部队的犯罪活动，当苏军于一九四五年迫近孙吴城时，西丰彦下令焚毁支队在该城的建筑物、装备和文件，并且执行了这一命令。
    （六）尾上正雄，为驻海林的七三一部队六四三支队支队长，曾从事研究改进细菌战新型武器和准备七三一部队所需物资的工作。他监督训练细菌战的专门干部。尾上深知关于被囚禁在七三一部队的那些人的成群被谋杀的情形，并且参与了这些最严重的罪行。一九四五年八月十三日，尾上为了灭迹起见，亲自焚毁了支队在该城的一切建筑、储藏的物资和文件。
    （七）佐藤春二，自一九四一年即任驻广州的细菌部队司令，该部队的秘密代号名为“波”字部队，在一九四三年，他被委任为类似的驻南京的“荣”字部队的司令。佐藤在领导这些部队的时候，参加改进细菌武器和准备细菌战的事宜。佐藤后来任关东军第五军的军医处长，领导着七三一部队的六四三支队，他知道七三一部队与六四三支队活动的罪恶性质，并帮助他们生产细菌武器。
