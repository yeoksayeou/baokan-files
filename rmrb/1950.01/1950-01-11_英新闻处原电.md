Original Telegram from the British Information Service

    The following original telegram from the British Information Service, announcing the establishment of diplomatic relations between the British government and the People's Republic of China, is hereby published:

    (British Information Service, London, 6th) The British government has de jure recognized the government of the Chinese Communist Party. The Foreign Office formally notified the aforementioned government in Beijing today and issued the following statement: "His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom has decided to recognize the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China as the de jure government of China. In accordance with this decision, His Majesty's Consul-General in Beijing has presented a note to Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, the original text of which is as follows:

    "Sir, I have the honor to inform Your Honorable Excellency that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has completed its study of the situation created by the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and, in view of the effective control of the vast majority of Chinese territory by this government, has today recognized that government as the de jure government of China. In these circumstances, His Majesty's Government, in response to Chairman Mao Zedong's proclamation of October 1, 1949, is willing to establish diplomatic relations with the Central People's Government on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territory and sovereignty, and is prepared to exchange diplomatic representatives. Pending the appointment of an ambassador, J.C. Hutchison has been appointed as His Majesty's Chargé d'Affaires ad interim. Therefore, I have the honor to request Your Honorable Excellency to receive him and to conduct official business with him in his capacity, and to grant all necessary facilities to enable him and his staff, as well as the archives of His Majesty's Embassy, to be moved from Nanjing to Beijing. Ernest Bevin, His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (signed).

            British and American Imperialists Remain United in Hostility Towards the Revolution of the New China and the People of Southeast Asian Countries

    His Majesty's Consul-General will simultaneously notify Zhou Enlai that, as a result of this decision, His Majesty's Government has withdrawn its recognition of the Chinese Nationalist Government. This decision was notified to Dr. Zheng Tianxi, the Chinese Ambassador in London, on the evening of January 5 by the Minister of State, Hector McNeil." The Foreign Office has now confirmed that His Majesty's Consul-General in Beijing, Graham, duly executed the instructions given to him this morning. The recognition of the Central People's Government of China is the recognition of an existing fact, namely that this government effectively controls the majority of Chinese territory, enjoys the obedience of the Chinese people, and has reason to believe that it can maintain permanence. In other words, the Beijing government meets the prerequisites required by international law for the recognition of a legitimate government. International law stipulates that when these conditions are met, recognition is a legal obligation. In this case, the responsibility is mutual: to the nationals of a country eligible for recognition, not to deprive them of their international legal benefits; and to the nationals of a country that is not yet recognized, not to deprive them of the normal diplomatic protection enjoyed by their interests in another country. Recognition of a government by no means implies endorsement of that government's policies, and vice versa. This is the case here, as it was with the governments of Eastern European countries or the Franco government. As announced in the Foreign Office statement, His Majesty's Government has simultaneously withdrawn its recognition of the Chinese Nationalist Government that has fled to Taiwan. In the future, His Majesty's Consul in Tamsui, Taiwan, will maintain de facto contact with the local authorities in Taiwan. This does not imply de facto diplomatic relations with the authorities there. The business of the British Consul will be limited to looking after British interests there. British recognition supports His Majesty's Government's attitude towards the so-called "blockade" of the Chinese coast by the Kuomintang. His Majesty's Government has never considered the "blockade" to be legitimate and will continue to regard it as illegal. They have so far provided naval protection to British shipping in Chinese waters up to the edge of Chinese territorial waters. They will continue to do so, but British naval vessels, as they have done hitherto, will not enter Chinese territorial waters, the sovereignty of which His Majesty's Government considers to have now passed to the Beijing government. In recent weeks, the Government of the United Kingdom has thoroughly exchanged views with other members of the Commonwealth on the recognition of the Beijing government through normal channels. Every government was informed of every development. The attitude of the United Kingdom is fully understood by all. The recognition of India and Pakistan preceded that of the United Kingdom, and Ceylon also announced its recognition today. At the same time, the Government of the United Kingdom has also exchanged many views with other friendly governments of the Atlantic Treaty Organization. The United States is not yet willing to recognize the Beijing government. Although there are some differences between Washington and London regarding short-term tactical issues, it is believed here that the two countries are united in the long-term goal of stemming the tide of communism in Southeast Asia. His Majesty's Government's recognition of the Beijing government does not imply that they are relaxing in the slightest their continued fight against Communist terrorists in Malaya and their general commitment to prevent the tide of communism from crossing the borders of China. In this regard, the Colombo Conference can make an important contribution.

    英新闻处原电
    附英国新闻处公布英国政府与中华人民共和国建立外交关系的原电如下：
    （英国新闻处伦敦六日电）英国在法律上承认中国共产党政府，今日由外交部正式通知北京上述政府，并发表下列声明宣布此事。“联合王国陛下政府决定承认中华人民共和国中央人民政府为中国的法律上的政府。国王驻北京总领事已按照此一决定将照会一件递交外交部长周恩来先生，原文如下：
    “先生：我荣幸地通知阁下，大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国陛下政府业已将中华人民共和国中央人民政府之成立所造成的形势研究完毕，而且鉴于这一政府有效控制中国领土的极大部分，业于本日承认该政府为中国的法律上的政府。在这种情况下，陛下政府应毛泽东主席在一九四九年十月一日的公告，愿与中央人民政府在平等、互利和互相尊重领土和主权的基础上建立外交关系，并准备互派外交代表。在未任命大使之前，已任命Ｊ·Ｃ·胡阶森为陛下的临时代办。因此，我荣幸地请求阁下予以接待并按其身份与之洽办公务，并请给予一切必须的便利，俾便其本人及其属员以及陛下大使馆的档案得以由南京迁往北京。不列颠陛下外交事务大臣恩尼斯特·贝文（签字）。
            英美帝国主义者仍一致对新中国和东南亚各国人民革命采取敌意
    陛下的总领事将同时通知周恩来，陛下政府由于这一决定的结果，已撤消对中国国民党政府的承认。这一决定已由国务大臣赫克脱·麦克奈尔于一月五日晚通知中国驻伦敦大使郑天锡博士。”外交部现已获得证实，陛下政府驻北京总领事格拉罕已于今晨合宜地执行了给他的训令。承认中国中央人民政府是承认存在的事实，即这个政府有效地控制了中国大部国土，得到中国人民群众的服从，并有理由认为可以保持恒久。换句话说，北京政府合乎国际法上承认一个合法政府所需的先决条件，国际法规定，当这些条件满足时，承认就是一种法律的责任。在这种情形下，责任是双方的：对有资格被承认的国家的国民，不剥夺其国际法利益；对还不承认的国家的国民，不剥夺其在别一国家内的利益所享正常的外交上的保护。承认一个政府绝非表示赞同这个政府的政策，反过来也是一样。这次的情形就是如此，和对于东欧各国政府或佛朗哥的政府的情形相似。如外交部声明所宣布的，陛下政府同时撤销了对逃到台湾的中国国民党政府的承认。今后，陛下政府驻台湾淡水领事将与台湾地方当局保持事实上的联系。这并不表示对那里当局的事实上外交关系。英国领事的事务将限于照顾英国在那里的利益。英国的承认，支持了陛下政府对国民党对中国海岸之所谓“封锁”的态度。陛下政府未曾认为“封锁”是合法的，而且将继续认为它是非法的。他们迄今予中国海上英国的航运以海军保护，直到中国领海边沿。他们将继续这样做，但英国海军舰只像迄今所做的一样，将不进入中国领海，陛下政府认为这个领海的主权现已转属北京政府。近数周来，联合王国政府曾通过普通途径与联邦其他国家透彻交换关于承认北京政府的意见。他们每一发展，都使每一政府知道。联合王国的态度，为全体所充分了解。印度与巴基斯坦的承认先于联合王国，锡兰亦于今日宣布承认。同时，联合王国政府还曾与其他大西洋公约国友好政府交换过许多的意见。美国现在还不愿承认北京政府。华盛顿与伦敦之间关于短期的策略问题虽有某些分歧，但此间认为，在阻挡东南亚共产主义潮流的长期目标上，两国是一致的。陛下政府承认北京政府并不表示他们丝毫放松他们继续对马来亚共产党恐怖作战以及一般地致力于阻止共产主义潮流越出中国国境的决心。在这方面，科伦坡会议将可有重要贡献。
