Following the Soviet representative's speech, the Kuomintang element chairing the Security Council meeting, in an attempt to indefinitely delay discussion of the Soviet proposal, used his position as chairman to decide to refer the proposal to a "special meeting" of the Security Council. He also stated that the Security Council should continue to review the issues on the agenda.

The Soviet representative spoke again, objecting to this suggestion, and on behalf of the Soviet Union, he opposed any decision made by someone who did not represent anyone on the Security Council. Malik insisted that the Soviet delegation's proposal be put to a vote immediately, because the Security Council could not continue to meet without voting on this proposal, given the denial of the right of someone to attend the Security Council and to serve as chairman at this meeting. Malik continued: The Soviet delegation believes that it is impossible for the Security Council to hold its next meeting with a person who does not represent anyone here, and whose presence on the Security Council is illegal, serving as chairman.

The Kuomintang representative used his convenience as chairman to put his suggestion to a vote. This Kuomintang element received the support of the representatives of the United States, Britain, France, Norway, Cuba, Ecuador, and Egypt. The Indian representative abstained.

The Soviet representative voted against the decision.

Malik declared after the vote: The Soviet delegation cannot agree to the decision just passed. He pointed out: It is absolutely abnormal to discuss these or those political issues on the agenda in a situation where five member states of the Security Council have severed relations with a group (whose representative is the gentleman serving as chairman here). This means that the Security Council will hold meetings with a person who does not represent anyone serving as chairman. This will not be a meeting, but a mockery of a meeting. Malik stated that, based on the reasons I have fully explained at today's meeting, I, as a representative of the Soviet Union, cannot participate in the work of the Security Council until the Kuomintang representatives are expelled from the Security Council. Based on this reason, I am leaving the Security Council meeting.

The representative of the Tito group proposed suspending the meeting's proceedings and discussing the Soviet delegation's proposal at the next Security Council meeting.

The U.S. representative, Gross, initially insisted that the Security Council should not suspend the meeting but should proceed to discuss the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. Then, he stubbornly insisted that the Soviet representative violated the Security Council's rules of procedure by demanding the immediate expulsion of the "Chinese representative" from the Security Council, but then he withdrew his objection.

The British representative, Jebb, spoke in a similar tone.

The Indian representative, Rau, then spoke, supporting the suspension of the meeting and the discussion of the Soviet proposal at the next meeting.

The majority of the Security Council member states decided without a vote to suspend the proceedings and discuss the Soviet proposal at the next meeting.

### 美英等国代表阻挠无效  苏联代表的提案决在下次会讨论

    美英等国代表阻挠无效
    苏联代表的提案决在下次会讨论
    在苏联代表发言之后，在安理会会议上当主席的国民党分子，为了企图无限期地拖延对苏联提案的讨论，便利用其主席的地位，决定将这个提案交由安理会的“特别会议”考虑。他同时还说，安理会应该继续进行审查议程上的问题。
    苏联代表再度发言，反对这个建议，同时，他代表苏联反对这种在安理会上不代表任何人的人所作的任何决定。马立克坚持立即将苏联代表团的建议提付表决，因为在未表决这个建议以前，安理会就不能继续开会，这是因为对某个人出席安理会的权利以及在此次会议上担任主席的权利提出了否认的缘故。马立克续称：苏联代表团认为，以一个在这里并不代表任何人的人，而且他的出席安理会是非法的人来担任主席，安理会是不可能召开下一次会议的。
    国民党代表利用他担任主席的便利，将他的建议提付表决。这个国民党分子得到了美国、英国、法国、挪威、古巴、厄瓜多尔和埃及的代表的支持。印度代表弃权。
    苏联代表投票反对这个决定。
    马立克在表决之后宣称：苏联代表团不能同意刚才通过的这个决定。他指出：在安理会有五个理事国与一个集团（这个集团的代表就是那位在这里担任主席的先生）断绝了关系的情形之下，还来讨论议程上的这些或那些政治问题，这是绝对不正常的事情。这就是说，安理会将会由一个不代表任何人的人担任主席而举行会议。这不会是会议，而会成为对会议的讽刺。马立克称，根据我在今日会议上充分说明了的理由，我作为苏联的代表，在国民党代表被开除出安理会之前，不能参加安理会的工作。根据这一理由，我离开安理会会议。
    铁托集团的代表提议中止会议的进程，并在安理会下次会议上讨论苏联代表团的提案。
    美国代表格罗斯起先坚决要求安理会不应该停止会议，而应该进行讨论联合国大会的决议。接着，他又硬说苏联代表因为要求将“中国代表”立即逐出安理会而违背安理会议事规则，但是，他然后又撤回他的反对。
    英国代表贾德干的发言，语气也是如此。
    印度代表劳氏继起发言，他赞成停止会议，并且在下次会议上讨论苏联的提案。
    安理会多数理事国未经表决而决定停止进行会议，并在下次会议上讨论苏联的提案。
