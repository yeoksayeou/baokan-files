Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 24th: A number of Tibetan compatriots in Chongqing, including Sangji Yexi (Tianbao), held a symposium on the Tibetan issue on the 23rd. Cheng Zijian, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, was invited to attend. The participating Tibetan compatriots unanimously opposed the recent actions reported by the U.S. Associated Press that the Lhasa authorities had dispatched a so-called "goodwill mission" to the United States, Britain, India, and Nepal to declare "independence," and expressed their support for the statement of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government. They believe that such actions by the Lhasa authorities cannot represent the will of the Tibetan people, but stem from the imperialist conspiracy to undermine the territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China and break up the big family of all ethnic groups in China, so as to continue to exploit the Tibetan people and keep them forever in colonial misery. The participants denounced the various crimes of imperialism in invading Tibet over the past century. They painfully recounted the recent active aggression of U.S. imperialism in Tibet and other situations, as well as the tragic and difficult lives of the Tibetan people under the long-term oppression of imperialism and internal reactionary forces. They unanimously stated that the Tibetan people urgently hope that their own troops, the People's Liberation Army, will liberate them from slavery as soon as possible. Deputy Minister Cheng Zijian pointed out in his speech that Commander-in-Chief Zhu recently reiterated the determination to liberate the Tibetan people, and the People's Liberation Army will make its utmost efforts to liberate Tibet as soon as possible. This determination and ultimate victory of the Chinese people cannot be stopped by any force. Finally, the Tibetan compatriots who participated in the symposium expressed that they would exchange more opinions in the future, unite the Tibetan people, and assist the government in completing the glorious task of liberating Tibet.

Tibet Has Always Been Chinese Territory - No Imperialist Interference Allowed

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 24th: People across the country unanimously support the statement issued by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government on January 20 regarding the so-called "goodwill mission" sent by the Lhasa authorities in Tibet. Xi Raojiacuo, member of the Northwest Military and Political Committee and Vice Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, said in a speech in Xi'an: "Just as the entire Tibetan people are longing for liberation, the imperialists are instigating the Lhasa authorities behind the scenes to carry out conspiracies of so-called independence and autonomy." However, the Tibetan people have always been closely united with the people of the motherland. We warmly support the Central People's Government in realizing national regional autonomy and leading the banner of longing for the motherland to point westward. The Tibetan people vow to take practical actions to assist our People's Liberation Army in driving out the imperialist aggressive forces forever." Responsible persons of workers', youth, student, women's, industrial and commercial organizations in Tianjin and the school affairs committees of Nankai and Beiyang Universities have all made speeches, denouncing the conspiracies of the Lhasa authorities and the imperialist aggressors. Liu Zucai, executive member of the Tianjin Democratic Youth Federation, said: "Tibet has always been Chinese territory. Any imperialist who wants to interfere in Tibet will inevitably be opposed by the people of our country." The Jinan People's Representative Conference, the Federation of Trade Unions, the Hui Muslim Association, the Garrison Forces, the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and student, youth, and women's organizations in Shandong Province have successively issued written statements, warmly supporting the Foreign Ministry's exposure of this conspiracy. The written statement of the Jinan People's Representative Conference stated: "We absolutely cannot allow the Lhasa authorities to violate the will of the Tibetan people and betray the motherland, nor can we tolerate any country undermining our complete territory."

The Shenyang Northeast Daily and the Changsha Democratic Daily published editorials on this matter. The Shenyang Northeast Daily stated in an editorial entitled "Crush the Imperialist Conspiracy to Invade Tibet": "If any reactionary does so under the instigation of imperialism, he is a traitor to the motherland and will be denounced by the people and punished by the state. If any country dares to disregard Chinese sovereignty and receive such an illegal 'mission,' it is deliberately making itself an enemy of the Chinese people, and the result will be a bloody nose."

    要求早日解放西藏
    各地人民拥护外交部发言人谈话
    【新华社重庆二十四日电】旅渝藏族人士桑吉悦希（天宝）等多人，于二十三日举行西藏问题座谈会。中共中央西南局统战部副部长程子健应邀参加。与会藏族人士一致反对最近美国合众社所传拉萨当局派遣所谓“亲善使团”赴美、英、印度、尼泊尔表明“独立”的行动，并表示拥护中央人民政府外交部发言人的谈话。他们认为：拉萨当局的这种行动绝不能代表西藏人民的意志，而是出于帝国主义破坏中华人民共和国领土的完整、拆散中国各民族的大家庭，以便继续压榨西藏民族，使之永远陷于殖民地厄运的阴谋。与会人士控诉帝国主义百年来侵略西藏的种种罪恶，他们沉痛地叙述了美帝国主义最近积极侵略西藏等情况，以及西藏人民长期在帝国主义及内部反动势力压迫下生活悲惨困苦的事实。他们一致表示：西藏人民迫切地愿望自己的队伍人民解放军早日把他们从奴隶的境地中解放出来。程子健副部长在发言中指出：朱总司令最近已重申解放西藏人民的决心，人民解放军一定会用最大的努力早日解放西藏。中国人民的这个决心和最后胜利是任何力量都阻止不了的。最后参加座谈会的藏族人士表示今后要多交换意见，团结西藏民族，协助政府完成解放西藏的光荣任务。
    西藏从来是中国领土  不准帝国主义者插足
    【新华社北京二十四日电】各地人民一致拥护中央人民政府外交部发言人一月二十日就西藏拉萨当局派出所谓“亲善使团”发表的谈话。西北军政委员会委员、青海省人民政府副主席喜饶嘉错在西安发表谈话称：“正当全西藏人民渴望解放的时候，帝国主义者却在背后策动拉萨当局进行所谓独立和自治的阴谋”。然而西藏人民始终是与祖国人民紧紧结合在一起的，我们热烈拥护中央人民政府，实现民族区域自治，引领渴望祖国的旌旗西指。西藏人民誓以实际行动，协助我人民解放军将帝国主义侵略势力永远赶出去”。天津市工人、青年、学生、妇女、工商业等团体和南开、北洋等大学校务委员会的负责人，都发表了谈话，指责拉萨当局及帝国主义侵略者的阴谋。天津市民主青年联合会执行委员刘祖才说：“西藏从来就是中国的领土，任何帝国主义想要插足西藏，都必将遭到我全国人民的反对。”济南市各界人民代表会议、总工会、回民协会、警备部队、工商联合会筹备会，以及山东省的学生、青年、妇女等团体纷纷发表书面声明，热烈拥护外交部对这个阴谋的揭露。济南市各界人民代表会议的书面声明称：“我们绝对不能允许拉萨当局违反西藏人民意志、背叛祖国的行为，亦绝对不能容忍任何国家对我完整领土的破坏。”
    沈阳东北日报和长沙民主报对此事发表了社论。沈阳东北日报在题为《粉碎帝国主义侵略西藏阴谋》的社论中称：“如果那一个反动派在帝国主义的指使下如此做，他就是祖国的叛徒，将受到人民的声讨和国家的制裁。如果那一个国家胆敢漠视中国主权去接待这样一个非法的“使团”，就是有意与中国人民为敌，其结果必将碰得头破血流。”
