    Absorbing Experience and Gradually Promoting
    Northeast China Trials a Complete Set of New Farm Tools
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th) The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northeast People's Government recently lent a complete set of new farm tools to five labor mutual aid groups for trial use, with the aim of learning from experience and gradually promoting them. In order to trial the complete set of new farm tools, including the single-furrow plow, double-furrow plow for land reclamation and plowing, the spike-tooth harrow, disc harrow for soil breaking, and the seed drill, weeding machine, seed selector, and other thirteen items, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northeast People's Government recently invited five experienced production mutual aid team leaders from Heilongjiang, Jilin, Songjiang, and Liaoxi provinces to hold a forum. The meeting discussed the conditions for trialing new farm tools, the existing difficulties, and ways to overcome them. After that, the team leaders expressed full confidence in using new farm tools and requested to use the complete set. Based on the production needs of each team, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry decided to rent one to two sets to each team and send personnel to each team for technical guidance. At the same time, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry signed a trial contract with the mutual aid teams and the county governments where the mutual aid teams are located. The trial period is set for three years. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry may, depending on the performance of the mutual aid teams, reward them with the originally rented farm tools or stop their use. The mutual aid teams guarantee that they will pay attention to the care and maintenance of the new farm tools and make full use of them for production, accumulating experience at all times. The county governments are responsible for assisting with technical guidance, solving some of the repair and oil supply difficulties, and promptly summarizing and exchanging experiences.
