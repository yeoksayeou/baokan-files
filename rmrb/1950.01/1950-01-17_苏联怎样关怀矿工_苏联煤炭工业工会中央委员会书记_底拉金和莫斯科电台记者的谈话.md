    How the Soviet Union Cares for Miners
    Conversation between Comrade Dilajin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Coal Industry Workers' Union, and a Reporter from Moscow Radio
    The Soviet miners, along with all the Soviet people, welcomed 1949 with tremendous labor achievements, and they have reported to Comrade Stalin the early completion of the annual coal mining plan. The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government show tireless concern for the labor and lives of the miners. A reporter from this station had a conversation with Comrade Dilajin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Coal Industry Workers' Union:
    “What exactly was done in 1949 to reduce the labor of miners and mechanize the labor process?”
    “In the past year, there have been great changes in all aspects of the coal mining process, and these changes are due to the large number of new technologies added to the mines. For example, we have received hundreds of coal combine machines, and the priority for using these machines belongs to Soviet designers. Historically, we are adopting machines on such a wide scale for the first time. All heavy coal stacking work has been completely mechanized, so work efficiency has increased tenfold compared to the pre-war period.
    The level of mechanization of Soviet miners' labor can be examined by comparing the following figures: among one hundred laborers, physical labor accounts for only one person."
    The reporter asked Comrade Dilajin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Coal Industry Workers' Union: "Is this being carried out in connection with the complete mechanization equipment?"
    "Yes. Last year, dozens of mines in various Soviet mining areas were converted to full mechanization. That is to say: all work processes, from coal mining to delivery to its consumers and loading onto railway stations, are entirely done by machines. This year, the number of fully mechanized coal mines will increase even more."
    In capitalist countries, the mechanization of labor is generally associated with mass layoffs of workers. Our reporter asked:
    "Please talk about the fate of the Soviet workers who are liberated from physical labor by all the new technologies."
    Dilajin replied: "Because the need for talent to manage new machines is emerging more and more in Soviet mines, workers will never lose their jobs after being liberated from physical labor. They all enter short-term mechanization schools for free to study, and these schools are set up in all mining areas. In addition, the Soviet Union is building many new mines, and many new mines have begun coal mining. Therefore, Soviet miners are permanently guaranteed jobs."
    Our reporter asked: "How were the miners rewarded last year?"
    "The Soviet government rewarded 32,500 Soviet miners with medals and orders for years of faultless work, and allocated 363 million rubles to elderly miners as bonuses exceeding ordinary wages."
    Our reporter asked: "Please continue to talk about what has been done to improve the cultural conditions of miners and their daily lives."
    Dilajin replied: "Throughout the year, extensive construction work was carried out in various Soviet mining areas, and every miner's family received new housing. On average, each mining area built three cultural palaces, fifty-six clubs, five schools, and ten medical institutions. The trade union organization spent 10 million rubles on club construction costs."
    "How did Soviet miners spend their vacations last year?"
    "Our trade union has dozens of sanatoriums in good recuperation areas in the country. During the year, among the people who went to the trade union sanatoriums for recuperation, 120,000 recuperated with state insurance benefits."
    Dilajin said at the end of his conversation: "In 1950, Soviet miners will receive more new machines that reduce labor, and housing construction and cultural level will be improved one step further on the basis of 1949. The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government always tirelessly care for the Soviet miners."

    苏联怎样关怀矿工
    苏联煤炭工业工会中央委员会书记
    底拉金和莫斯科电台记者的谈话
    苏联矿工们也和全体苏联人民一块以巨大的劳动成就欢送了一九四九年，他们已将先期完成全年采煤计划呈报给斯大林同志了。布尔塞维克党与苏联政府对矿工们的劳动与生活表示出永世不倦的关怀。本台记者曾与苏联煤炭工业工会中央委员会书记底拉金进行了谈话：
    “在一九四九年内，在减轻矿工劳动与劳动过程机械化方面究竟做了一些什么呢？”
    “在去年里于全部采煤过程方面有了极大的改变，这种改变是由于矿井内增添了大量的新技术所引起的。例如，我们曾领到了数百架煤炭康拜因机，使用这些机器的优先权，乃属于苏维埃设计家们，在历史上，我们是首次以那样广泛的规模采用着机器。凡是繁重的堆积煤的工作，都完全机械化了，因此，工作效率就比战前时期提高了十倍。
    关于苏维埃矿工劳动机械化水平，可以在这样对比数字上去考查一下：在一百个劳动工人当中，体力劳动仅占一名。”
    记者向苏联煤炭工业工会中央委员会书记底拉金问道：“这是与全部机械化装备联系进行的吗？”
    “是的。去年在苏联各矿区数十个矿井内，曾改建为全部机械化。这就是说：从掘煤起，到送给它的需求者，及装到铁路火车站的一切工作过程全部使用机器。在本年度，所有采煤全部机械化矿井数量将更加增多。”
    在资本主义国家内，劳动的机械化一般的是与大量解雇工人相联系着的。我们的记者问道：
    “请你谈一谈关于一切新技术从体力劳动中解放出来的苏联工人们的命运。”
    底拉金答道：“由于管理新机器在苏维埃矿井里涌现出日益增多的需要人才，因此工人决不能从体力劳动解放后就失掉工作。他们都免费进入机械化短期学校去学习，在所有的矿区中都设有这类学校。除此而外，苏联正在建设着许多新矿井，许多新矿井已开始了采煤工作。因此，苏维埃的矿工永久都保证有工作。”
    我们的记者问道：“在去年都怎样奖赏了矿工们？”
    “苏维埃政府曾奖赏了多年工作无过错的苏联矿工三万二千五百名以奖章与勋章，拨给年老矿工三亿六千三百万卢布作为超过普通工资的奖金。”
    我们的记者问道：“请你继续谈一谈在改善矿工文化条件及矿工们的日常生活上都做了一些什么呢？”
    底拉金回答道：“在全年过程中，在苏联各矿区内曾进行了广泛的建筑工作，每一个矿工家庭都得到新住宅。全国平均每一矿区建筑了三所文化宫、五十六所俱乐部、五所学校、十个医疗机关。工会组织曾用在俱乐部建筑费上一千万卢布。”
    “去年苏维埃矿工怎样渡过了他们的休假期呢？”
    “我们的工会于国内具有良好的疗养区中设有数十个疗养院。在一年过程中，到工会各疗养院疗养的人士当中，享受国家保险金的疗养者达十二万人。”
    底拉金在自己的谈话结尾时说道：“一九五○年内，苏维埃矿工将领到更多的减轻劳动的新机器，并在住宅建设与文化水平方面都将在一九四九年的基础上提高一步。布尔塞维克党与苏维埃政府对苏维埃矿工总是始终不倦的关怀着。”
