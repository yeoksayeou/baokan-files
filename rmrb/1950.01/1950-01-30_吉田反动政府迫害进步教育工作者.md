Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 28th: The reactionary Yoshida government of Japan is dismissing progressive educators on a large scale. According to a TASS dispatch on the 26th: The authorities of Nagano Prefecture, Japan, recently ordered twenty-one educators with progressive ideas to resign within twenty-four hours. The reason they were forced to resign was "insufficient adherence to a sound ideological line." According to news from Tokyo, the Tokyo Education Bureau recently decided to dismiss two hundred and fifty to three hundred teachers on the grounds that "they are Communists or sympathize with the Communist Party."

    吉田反动政府迫害进步教育工作者
    【新华社北京二十八日电】日本吉田反动政府正在大批开除进步的教育工作者。据塔斯社二十六日讯：日本长野县当局顷命令二十一位有进步思想的教育工作者，于二十四小时内辞职。他们被迫辞职的理由是“不充分遵守健全的思想路线”。另据东京消息，东京教育局最近决定开除二百五十名至三百名教师，理由是“他们是共产党员或同情共产党”。
