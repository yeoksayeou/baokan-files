[This Newspaper's Report] The first semester of study at the North China University Evening School has concluded, and the second semester began on the 9th of this month. From the beginning of the semester in early October of last year to the end of December, during the three months of study, the students maintained a consistently high level of enthusiasm for learning. Over 93% of the students participated in the end-of-semester exams. The teaching plan was successfully completed. The students have made significant progress. In terms of Chinese language, the students' reading and writing abilities have generally improved. For example, students in Class A are generally able to fully understand the Worker's Daily and can write relatively coherent articles and diaries that explain issues clearly. Students in Class B were unable to write diaries at the beginning of the semester, and their compositions were only about 100-200 words long and filled with errors; now they can understand the Worker's Daily and write simple diaries, and their articles are relatively coherent. Class C has achieved the ability to write, speak, and use words and sentences. Students have a basic understanding of general political knowledge such as the Four Friends, Three Enemies, People's Democratic Dictatorship, and New Democracy; their general knowledge of natural science has also been enriched. The students' political awareness has also been raised, and they generally recognize that studying is for the purpose of working. Some people, in their study summaries, have pledged to the Party that they will unreservedly complete the work tasks assigned to them by the Party and the people.

Based on the teaching experience of the last semester, the school has formulated the teaching plan for this semester as follows: (1) Course materials and progress for three months. The curriculum for Class A includes Chinese, Arithmetic, History, and Geography. Chinese will be taught for four hours per week, completing the second volume of junior high school Chinese; Arithmetic will complete the unfinished portion of junior high school arithmetic; History will complete the first volume of modern Chinese history and half of the second volume; Geography will complete the first volume of Chinese geography. Each of the above courses will be taught for two hours per week. The curriculum for Class B includes Chinese, Arithmetic, History, and Natural Science. Each course is planned to complete the second volume of senior primary school textbooks. The curriculum for Class C includes Chinese, Arithmetic, and Political Common Sense. Chinese will be taught for five hours per week, completing the third volume of the Worker's Literacy Textbook; Arithmetic will be taught for three hours per week, completing the fifth and sixth volumes of elementary school arithmetic; Political Common Sense will focus on current events, linking related historical, geographical, and political common sense. All three classes will have one extracurricular writing assignment per week. Class D will have five hours of Chinese class per week, completing the second volume of the Worker's Literacy Textbook. (2) Adhere to various systems, including the meeting, reporting, and inspection system, the examination system, the attendance system, and the leave-of-absence system. Eliminate the phenomenon of absenteeism or failure to hold monthly exams on schedule that occurred in the last semester among a small number of students. (3) Strengthen the subject-specific work groups. This semester, in addition to researching teaching methods, teaching content, and exchanging teaching experiences, subject-specific work groups will encourage teachers to create new teaching methods and edit textbooks. (4) Strengthen extracurricular activities. Each branch school should publish wall newspapers or encourage students to submit articles to existing wall newspapers; students in Classes A, B, and C should write diaries, which can not only improve writing skills but also help understand their ideological situation and facilitate ideological guidance; encourage students to read extracurricular books, taking notes while reading, which will be reviewed by Chinese teachers. In addition, regularly organize students to read newspapers and engage in necessary cultural and recreational activities.
