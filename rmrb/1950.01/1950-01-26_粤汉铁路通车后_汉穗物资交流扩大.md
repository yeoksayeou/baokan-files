    After the Opening of the Yuehan Railway, Material Exchange Between Wuhan and Guangzhou Expands
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the official opening of the Yuehan Railway on January 1st, the material exchange between Wuhan and Guangzhou has begun to increase. According to statistics, from the 3rd to the 17th, in half a month, the goods transported from Guangzhou to Wuhan included 1170 tons of paper, 220 tons of kerosene, 170 tons of sugar, 110 tons of equipment, 70 tons of medicines, 40 tons of tires, 30 tons of bananas, and 1140 tons of other goods, totaling 2950 tons. Goods transported from Wuchang to Guangzhou included 1085 tons of bean cake, 590 tons of soybeans, 420 tons of tobacco leaves, 220 tons of piece goods, 160 tons of cotton yarn, 100 tons of medicinal materials, 60 tons of tea, 30 tons of pig bristles, and 1015 tons of other goods, totaling 3680 tons. In the initial stage of the opening, merchants from both places transported very little due to a lack of understanding of the situation. Now, the amount increases greatly every day, creating a phenomenon where vehicles cannot meet demand. The Wuchang Dispatch Office is requesting a large number of vehicles from the Hengyang Railway Bureau for transportation.
