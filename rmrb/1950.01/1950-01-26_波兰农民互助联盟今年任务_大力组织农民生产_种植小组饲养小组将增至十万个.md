Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 24th: Polish News Agency, Warsaw dispatch: Ignar, Chairman of the Polish Peasants' Mutual Aid Alliance, summarized the Alliance's activities in 1949 at the third meeting of the Alliance's Central Committee. Ignar said: The Alliance currently has 1.5 million members (Polish farmers number approximately 12.12 million), and the two most important achievements obtained in 1949 were: (1) The organizational form of the previous capitalist cooperative movement—the "Supervisory Committee"—was abolished and replaced with 16,000 member committees and 3,000 village central control committees as socialist cooperative control institutions. (2) 74,000 cultivation and breeding groups were organized with the participation of 1.2 million farmers.

The Alliance's General Secretary, Jaworski, proposed in his report that the most important task for 1950 is to increase the number of planting and breeding groups to 100,000, and the number of participants to 2 million. At least 50,000 group leaders should be trained for these groups, and these groups should be mobilized to participate in collective labor competitions to make the competitions more mass-based. Another task is to pay special attention to helping establish rural production cooperatives, give the existing cooperatives the greatest care, and promote cooperation between cultivation groups, breeding groups, cooperatives, and rural administrative organs.

The cultural and educational work in the Polish countryside is also centrally conducted by the Peasants' Mutual Aid Alliance. In 1949, the Alliance also achieved excellent results in establishing literacy classes, libraries, clubs, art troupes, and sports teams in rural areas, and will further expand this year.

    波兰农民互助联盟今年任务
    大力组织农民生产
    种植小组饲养小组将增至十万个
    【新华社北京二十四日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰农民互助联盟主席伊格那尔，在联盟中央委员会第三次会议上，总结了联盟一九四九年的活动。伊格那尔说：联盟现有一百五十万盟员（按波兰农民约为一千二百余万），一九四九年度所获得的两个最重要的成就是：（一）取消了以前资本主义合作社运动的组织形式——“监察委员会”，代之以一万六千个盟员委员会和三千个乡村中心管制委员会，作为社会主义性质的合作社管制机构。（二）组织了有一百二十万农民参加的七万四千个耕种小组和饲养小组。
    联盟总书记雅沃尔斯基，在他的报告中提出一九五○年最主要的任务，是要把种植小组和饲养小组增加到十万个，参加的人数要增加到二百万，至少要为这些小组训练出五万个小组长，动员这些小组参加集体劳动竞赛，使竞赛更具群众性。另一任务是要特别注意帮助建立乡村生产合作社，对于现有的合作社予以最大的照顾，并促进耕种小组、饲养小组与合作社及乡村行政机构的合作。
    波兰农村的文化教育工作也集中由农民互助联盟进行。一九四九年联盟在乡村成立识字班、图书馆、俱乐部、艺术队及体育队方面，也获得了优良成绩，今年将进一步扩大。
