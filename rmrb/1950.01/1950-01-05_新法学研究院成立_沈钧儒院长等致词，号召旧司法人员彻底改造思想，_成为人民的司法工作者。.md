    [Beijing News] The China New Institute of Jurisprudence, established to reform former judicial personnel, held its opening ceremony at 10:00 AM on January 4th in the auditorium of China University of Political Science and Law.

At the ceremony, President Shen Junru of the institute delivered a speech, pointing out that various aspects of the new China are growing, and new people's laws are being created. To consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, a large number of judicial talents must be cultivated, and cultivating people's judicial talents must start from three aspects: (1) Improving judicial workers in the revolutionary regime; (2) Reforming judicial personnel of the old society; (3) Cultivating new judicial workers. The establishment of the China New Institute of Jurisprudence is to undertake the task of reforming former judicial personnel. He called on all students to thoroughly reform their thinking, work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, as well as the judicial experience of the old liberated areas and Soviet legal knowledge, in order to become judicial workers for the people. Vice Premier Dong then spoke, pointing out that ideological reform is difficult and painful, especially for intellectuals. However, it is possible to reform, and only by reforming one's thinking can one serve the people and become a people's judicial worker. Vice Minister of Justice Li Mu'an, Deputy Director of the Legislative Affairs Commission Chen Jinkun, Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Lan Gongwu, and others spoke successively, pointing out that it is necessary to abandon the burdens of past old intellectual knowledge, old legal theories, and old judicial experiences, overcome the shortcomings of individualism, and overcome the views of despising labor and the masses, in order to become judicial workers for the people. Finally, a student representative of the institute delivered a reply, expressing determination to thoroughly reform their thinking, arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, establish a new outlook on life of serving the people and a new legal perspective of serving the people's democratic dictatorship, and work wholeheartedly for the people's judiciary.
