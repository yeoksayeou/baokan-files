    Tianjin Business Community Subscribes to Public Bonds
    Democratic Appraisal Combined with Consultation
    All Circles in the Capital Continue to Purchase More Than 26,000 Shares
    [This newspaper reports] The work of promoting public bonds in the Tianjin business community is gradually maturing, and has now entered the stage of determining subscription figures. Most industry promotion branches have adopted a combination of democratic appraisal and consultation to enthusiastically carry out this work. Some (such as the automotive materials industry) are even challenging each other, resolutely marching towards completing the glorious task. The First Branch of the Public Bond Promotion Committee held working group meetings for both industry and commerce yesterday afternoon and evening, at which the subscription situation of various industries was reported. In the industrial sector, 36 industries including wool spinning and machinery have already reported their subscription figures to the branch, which is currently studying them in detail based on individual circumstances. In the commercial sector, five major industries including import and export, money industry, banking, cotton yarn and cloth, and hardware have largely completed their subscriptions, but they are prepared to further push forward on the basis of existing subscriptions. Bi Mingqi, Chairman of the Import and Export Association, stated at last night's commercial working group meeting that the five industries are continuing to consult and gradually resolve members' concerns, striving to play an exemplary role in the business community's subscription to public bonds. At the same time, thanks to the efforts of the person in charge, the Oil Merchants Association has completed the subscription of 23,000 shares. When the chairman of the association reported this at the working group meeting, he received warm applause from the attendees.
    [This newspaper reports] The upsurge in purchasing public bonds in Tianjin has been driven by the active actions of the business community, leading to subscriptions from wealthy households and retired civil and military officials. The First Branch of the Public Bond Promotion Committee, responsible for promoting public bonds to the business community, has been conducting in-depth publicity and organizing subscriptions for days, and has entered the stage of specific allocation of subscription amounts. The Second Branch, responsible for promoting public bonds to wealthy households and retired civil and military officials, has selected 313 members in the city's eleven districts to establish promotion committees in each district, which have immediately begun mobilization work.
