    A Non-Exam Examination
    ——Recording the "Automobile Engineering" Inspection of Tsinghua Mechanical Engineering Class Four
    This learning inspection of the fourth-year students of the Mechanical Engineering Department in "Automobile Engineering," through the joint efforts of teachers and students, was successfully graded and also inspected the teaching. The students believe this was a very successful event.
    First, Professor Song Yiying proposed to the students to use the "self-report and public discussion" grading method to inspect learning. He emphasized, "Our summary does not mean no examination, but a 'non-exam examination,' which is basically the same meaning as an exam, both are to inspect and promote learning." The Mechanical Engineering Class Four group leaders discussed Professor Song's suggestion. The grading work was divided into four steps: studying, group grading, class meeting discussion, and Professor Song's final inspection. During the studying phase, the focus was on thorough understanding. After individual self-study, mutual aid groups researched the notes, not letting go of any half-understood words on the notes, and sharing the gains from reading reference books to enrich everyone's notes. Through such discussions, everyone understood the basic principles. Any unclear or insufficiently understood points were raised, and then used to guide individual self-study. This method of self-study and discussion promoted deeper learning.
    During the group evaluation, it started with "self-reporting," mainly with individuals reporting their level of understanding of the learning, and then assessing their own grade according to the standards set by Professor Song. After self-reporting, how to evaluate? A "typical example" was chosen on the spot. The selected student was rigorously questioned by everyone to determine his grade, and then used as a "standard scale" to evaluate the scores of other students. Some used oral exams, some discussed problems, and to ensure a fair evaluation, everyone attached great importance to both the usual self-study and the performance in mutual aid groups. We criticized the bad and praised the good, bit by bit.
    The purpose of grading is just as student Cheng Guanyi said: "The score represents my level of understanding of learning today. If I understand more in the future, I will have the right to request an upgrade." To ensure that the evaluations between groups were fair and reasonable, the results of the evaluation were announced at the class meeting so that everyone could offer opinions. At the class meeting, the scores of all students were approved.
    The result of the score evaluation not only represents the students' level of understanding of the course, but also reflects Professor Song's teaching performance. Therefore, the results of group discussions and students' learning situations must be personally inspected by Professor Song. Such an inspection is an important link for future teaching improvements.
    The results of the evaluation show that those with scores above 90 accounted for 5%, those with scores between 80 and 90 accounted for 52.5%, and those with scores below 80 accounted for 42.5%. Student Feng Rongpu said: "The scores evaluated in this way represent true achievements. In the past, we crammed for two days, let go of what we didn't understand, and skimmed over what we didn't have time to see, and still managed to get 80 or 90 points by luck. When reporting our own scores, we can't bluff anymore." Many students felt that this kind of evaluation truly achieved the effect of inspecting learning. Unlike past exams, regardless of importance, we swallowed everything whole and squeezed it out during the exam. A few days after the exam, we forgot everything. Now, we study systematically, distinguish between major and minor points, and understand more deeply. (Tsinghua Mechanical Engineering Class Four Communication Group)

    一个不考的考试
    ——记清华机四“汽车工程”检查的经过
    这一次机械系四年级“汽车工程”的学习检查，在师生的共同努力下评分了，还检查了教学。同学们以为这是很成功的一次。
    先是宋镱瀛教授向同学提出用“自报公议”的评分办法来检查学习。他强调地说：“我们的总结并不是说不考试，而是“不考的考试”，基本上和考试是一样的意义，都是为了检查和推动学习。”机四小组长会议时讨论了宋教授的建议。把评分工作分成温书、小组评分、班会讨论和宋教授的最后检查四个步骤。在温书中着重在彻底了解。经过一个人自学再来互助小组里研究笔记，不放过笔记上每句一知半解的话，并且把各人看参考书的收获告诉大家，充实大家笔记的内容。经过了这样的讨论，每个人弄明白了基本的原理。凡遇到不懂的或了解不够的提了出来，反过来再指导个人自学。用这样的自学和讨论的方法推动更深入一步的学习。
    小组评议的时候，是从“自报”开始的，主要是由自己报告学习上了解的程度，再按照宋教授所订的标准，评定自己的等级。自报以后怎么评呢？于是当场选出一个“典型”。被选出的同学，经过大家严格的考问，确定了他的等级，于是以他作“标准尺度”来评定其他同学的分数。有的用口试，有的谈问题，为了评得公平，评分的时候大家非常重视平时的自学和在互助小组里的表现两方面。我们一点一滴地批评坏的，表扬好的。
    评分的目的正象程贯一同学所说：“分数是代表我今天学习了解的程度。将来我懂得更多一点，我便有权要求提高我的等级。”为了使各小组之间评议得公平合理，班会公布了评议的结果，好让大家提意见。在班会上，通过了全体同学的分数。
    分数评定的结果不但代表了同学们对课程了解的程度，同时也反映了宋教授教课的成绩。所以小组讨论的结果，同学们学习的情况都须经过宋教授的亲自检查。这样的检查对于今后教学的改进是重要的一环。
    评分的结果，我们的分数是九十分以上的占百分之五，八十至九十分的占百分之五十二点五，八十分以下的占百分之四十二点五。冯荣普同学说：“这样评议的分数，才是表示真成绩。以前拚命闹两天，不懂的放过去，来不及看的马马虎虎，碰上运气还考上八九十分。自己报分，就不好摆空城计了。”许多同学都感到了这种评议真正收到了检查学习的效果。不象过去的考试，不管重要和次要，生吞活剥一把抓，考的时候挤出来。考后不几天便忘了个光。现在，我们有系统地温书，分别主要和次要，了解更深刻。（清华机四通讯小组）
